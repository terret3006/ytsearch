40.44 --> 45.839999999999996
early-bird number 521 I'm your host

43.74 --> 47.550000000000004

56.94 --> 61.5
please also do support me for the paypal

59.76 --> 63.69
patron my GoFundMe - super Jetta and

61.5 --> 68.28
soon-to-be membership system that will

63.69 --> 75.06
be much appreciated try to get to it but

68.28 --> 78.15
it's just it need to need to figure out

75.06 --> 80.55
like went around that that stuff out I

78.15 --> 83.009
think I could potentially do it this

80.55 --> 85.47
afternoon already got groceries I should

83.009 --> 94.58
have just this piece of time to actually

85.47 --> 96.63
get to it so yeah the weather today it's

94.58 --> 101.07
it's quite beautiful

96.63 --> 107.63
but big butts there's there's definitely

101.07 --> 111.86999999999999
chemtrails going on with certainties

107.63 --> 114.02
it's not contrails and there's been some

111.87 --> 116.43
going on for a while

114.02 --> 120.71
yesterday evening also and you can still

116.43 --> 127.72900000000001
see all that the dust feathers up there

120.71 --> 130.709
in in strike pattern spread out so yeah

127.729 --> 135.659
but despite that it's still warm and

130.709 --> 140.799
sunny and nice day

135.659 --> 143.379
you know technically I did I call them

140.799 --> 147.34
can I chemtrails in opposition to

143.379 --> 149.85999999999999
contrails but yeah I don't even have any

147.34 --> 152.20000000000002
certainties as to what did it exactly is

149.86 --> 155.94000000000003
the substance whether it is like

152.2 --> 159.849
chemical or just some solid as I

155.94 --> 163.12
suggested it it could simply be dust

159.849 --> 164.5
like just like what would happen in

163.12 --> 166.75
nature but they're spraying it

164.5 --> 169.15
artificially to kind of force that

166.75 --> 172.769
natural effect maybe that is it I don't

169.15 --> 176.5
know you know it's there is no

172.769 --> 178.54
geoengineering report like next to the

176.5 --> 182.069
weather report saying like oh yeah today

178.54 --> 185.739
we're gonna spray in this percentile

182.069 --> 187.599
amount in these regions because that

185.739 --> 191.59
would alter the weather like this and

187.599 --> 193.72
that you know if you know the weird

191.59 --> 199.26
thing is at this point if they'd sort of

193.72 --> 199.26
can't be classify it retroactively Lee

199.349 --> 205.53
probably the people would probably just

201.94 --> 207.73
go with it you know there's there's

205.53 --> 211.569
generations now out there that have

207.73 --> 216.54
literally grown up in a world where this

211.569 --> 218.79899999999998
has always been happening since 1995

216.54 --> 222.72
there's plenty of people out there that

218.799 --> 222.72
just know don't know any better anyway

223.65 --> 233.079
why not just declassify like yeah we're

228.639 --> 235.15
doing that works very well does it it

233.079 --> 238.26000000000002
should otherwise why would they be

235.15 --> 243.12900000000002
constantly constantly doing it you know

238.26 --> 248.13899999999998
anyway I got green tea with me and the

243.129 --> 255.72
special trick fresh strawberries really

248.139 --> 259.40000000000003
gorgeous ones they're like really fresh

255.72 --> 262.239
yet they're very sweet

259.4 --> 262.239
hmm

267.229 --> 282.71
hmmm let's see you isn't yet alright

278.159 --> 294.18
so light energy was first I think right

282.71 --> 302.4
yeah Tom Parker and the you Steve James

294.18 --> 309.509
Mason over muku glass Shaw Cleary as our

302.4 --> 318.029
Salim yeah good to see you all it's

309.509 --> 327.629
Monday yeah last the Sunday was a

318.029 --> 331.5
interesting day lots of activity I yeah

327.629 --> 333.81
it was a I saw a little hangout it

331.5 --> 336.449
wasn't for me it was recorded it wasn't

333.81 --> 338.639
directly live stream from scuba Dracula

336.449 --> 343.259
so it's fun to see what he does he's

338.639 --> 346.349
such an activist and always finds like

343.259 --> 348.539
these vibrant atmospheres for that it's

346.349 --> 353.46
just the guys just crushing it every

348.539 --> 357.659
time and he went to a protest in Ontario

353.46 --> 359.789
like open open up Ontario and I was

357.659 --> 362.339
there yet that was yeah it was good to

359.789 --> 363.96
see and there was a lot of spirit among

362.339 --> 368.819
the public there they were really like

363.96 --> 371.31
well kind of pissed off and not just

368.819 --> 373.65000000000003
like we have to protest now there was

371.31 --> 376.43
like no we're we're genuinely pissed off

373.65 --> 376.42999999999995
with this nonsense

379.8 --> 385.719
you could hear in their voices and was

382.449 --> 389.59000000000003
good also made up a yeah a couple of

385.719 --> 392.159
slogans scuba dracula's fishy fishing

389.59 --> 396.06899999999996
for slogans like yeah what could we say

392.159 --> 398.43899999999996
Jeff what can you make up so they can

396.069 --> 400.659
put that on on billboards and [ __ ] so I

398.439 --> 403.16900000000004
of course forwarded my quarantine the

400.659 --> 403.169
government

418.13 --> 423.56
all right and yeah you can make up all

420.56 --> 426.65
kinds of interesting slogans like that

423.56 --> 435.58
like about tear down the Gates

426.65 --> 443.92999999999995
Foundation or whu-oh is in is a a la RP

435.58 --> 445.96999999999997
like that like you could say thought of

443.93 --> 449.21
things that really stick and that hit a

445.97 --> 451.22
lot of information that has been going

449.21 --> 453.10999999999996
around that people will recognize in

451.22 --> 456.20000000000005
that slogan it I don't know it's just

453.11 --> 464.18
like memeing and I like doing that stuff

456.2 --> 468.05
so the gates of hell yeah well that's

464.18 --> 470.90000000000003
you know if you I get that yeah but you

468.05 --> 477.38
already see like Bill Gates being called

470.9 --> 480.38
gates that yeah that brings all kinds of

477.38 --> 484.48
word meme options with it and you can

480.38 --> 484.48
focus it all on him you know if you want

484.54 --> 492.5
but yeah I I like to get as much

488.6 --> 494.48
involved in in memes as I can how do i

492.5 --> 497.33
how much you really know about Bill

494.48 --> 501.47
Gates his father well enough to know

497.33 --> 504.56
that he was a pretty messed up person or

501.47 --> 507.53000000000003
is he isn't he's not alive I think I

504.56 --> 510.19
don't know Bill Gates is himself already

507.53 --> 510.19
pretty old

514.31 --> 521.7399999999999
Daigo turns gates gate

526.63 --> 535.0
but how about just close the gates

529.85 --> 535.0
foundation you know

543.03 --> 550.87
[Music]

545.44 --> 550.87
or seal the gates how about that

556.32 --> 559.479
[Music]

568.59 --> 574.69
right master slim yeah yes it's

571.33 --> 579.63
blatantly obvious that he he sprang

574.69 --> 582.7
forth from the core group that basically

579.63 --> 586.81
created eugenics operations in the

582.7 --> 592.0200000000001
United States and reaching farther than

586.81 --> 592.02
that that is blend blatantly obvious

596.21 --> 601.25
anyway I don't necessarily want to talk

599.18 --> 602.66
about him you know I don't like him I

601.25 --> 605.51
never really liked him

602.66 --> 609.7099999999999
and it's almost like yeah if I go oh

605.51 --> 613.06
like it feels like I am giving him

609.71 --> 613.0600000000001
energy that he doesn't deserve

621.68 --> 629.1189999999999
I like in a way I wish that because yeah

626.93 --> 631.55
there is Microsoft know that and look

629.119 --> 635.509
Bill Gates did a lot of damage in the

631.55 --> 639.17
computer world okay a lot software wise

635.509 --> 642.439
he constantly kept up basically hostile

639.17 --> 644.1189999999999
taking over good programmer projects

642.439 --> 645.74
that were trying to be independent and

644.119 --> 648.1990000000001
just destroyed them

645.74 --> 651.92
it's like infamous for that that's what

648.199 --> 655.0089999999999
I knew him for before all this eugenics

651.92 --> 657.17
nonsense before I learned about that

655.009 --> 659.9590000000001
before that I just knew like yeah Bill

657.17 --> 662.569
Gates is that total corporate dick that

659.959 --> 664.66
just keeps on destroying the programmer

662.569 --> 670.779
scene terrible

664.66 --> 676.55
notorious so in a way I yeah I wish that

670.779 --> 680.3
like software conglomerates concerns

676.55 --> 683.149
like Microsoft and windows and all that

680.3 --> 687.29
I wish that they'd almost like you just

683.149 --> 690.139
recognize what they've become try to

687.29 --> 694.009
become a solid self-sufficient

690.139 --> 696.199
foundation to just be what they are and

694.009 --> 702.379
to be good at it and kind of like get

696.199 --> 706.939
rid of the frickin gates like just throw

702.379 --> 710.179
him off there like you like yes we don't

706.939 --> 713.179
need you anymore like nobody really ever

710.179 --> 716.99
did but like its I finally become

713.179 --> 721.699
something kind of forcefully like that

716.99 --> 724.399
well then just let it be what it is let

721.699 --> 729.049
it be a good operating system and stop

724.399 --> 731.899
the nonsense and I think everybody would

729.049 --> 734.389
prefer that at this point like everybody

731.899 --> 737.29
except maybe Bill Gates himself because

734.389 --> 737.29
he is a total dick

744.49 --> 750.08
but yeah I just don't like to you might

748.04 --> 753.89
have noticed I typically don't like to

750.08 --> 757.19
obsess over like really dark people in

753.89 --> 763.67
the world that I don't really meet face

757.19 --> 766.8800000000001
to face it ever anyway just like Hillary

763.67 --> 769.76
Clinton you know it those things those

766.88 --> 771.4399999999999
people it's so obvious all of that like

769.76 --> 773.87
I feel like I

771.44 --> 777.9200000000001
I'm literally just wasting my energy and

773.87 --> 780.529
time by making them an item it that's

777.92 --> 782.8389999999999
how it feels to me but I'm not gonna

780.529 --> 785.95
like try to stop anyone else doing that

782.839 --> 785.95
you know

788.86 --> 795.5500000000001
yeah in a way I guess I'd like to obsess

792.67 --> 798.31
a little bit more over just people that

795.55 --> 802.7199999999999
are psychologically deranged that

798.31 --> 805.6899999999999
typically I bump into constantly I've

802.72 --> 807.52
spent more time describing their

805.69 --> 811.1800000000001
character and what I thought about them

807.52 --> 814.4499999999999
and yeah because those are people that I

811.18 --> 817.81
kind of meat that I bump into that are

814.45 --> 819.82
in my way also times so yeah that I'd

817.81 --> 823.51
rather talk about them because at least

819.82 --> 826.3900000000001
I kind of know them you know with all

823.51 --> 829.6
these key people up there that it gets

826.39 --> 833.23
so much negative attention I I know very

829.6 --> 836.41
little about them really if I heard so

833.23 --> 843.1
much about them fiafia but I I've never

836.41 --> 846.79
like really gotten to know them to also

843.1 --> 849.34
understand how they work how everything

846.79 --> 855.6899999999999
that surrounds them has gotten to be the

849.34 --> 858.88
way that is as crazy and like it is I I

855.69 --> 862.9300000000001
can't explain it I'd have to literally

858.88 --> 865.06
just like get to know him in order to

862.93 --> 868.7199999999999
understand that fully I have my

865.06 --> 872.7299999999999
suspicions but yeah I just realized

868.72 --> 875.38
effectively I don't know much about him

872.73 --> 878.29
except for everything that's been said

875.38 --> 880.24
and the yeah the just the the results of

878.29 --> 882.8199999999999
the the corporate decisions and

880.24 --> 885.99
everything that he's made that is

882.82 --> 885.99
unmistakable he did that

893.1 --> 900.3100000000001
can i unban right hand Oh God

896.68 --> 903.78
well good servant if you ask it I guess

900.31 --> 908.02
I could try it

903.78 --> 909.76
it's just that yeah I did probably not

908.02 --> 915.0699999999999
gonna last long it never really does

909.76 --> 925.3199999999999
with him cuz he just doesn't come the

915.07 --> 928.1500000000001
[ __ ] down ever okay but let me see I

925.32 --> 933.0400000000001
don't even know how to get there anymore

928.15 --> 936.37
now I technically I am now not in the

933.04 --> 939.1899999999999
know as to how to unban people at this

936.37 --> 942.37
very moment I'm trying to figure it out

939.19 --> 944.6400000000001
again though I don't know where to find

942.37 --> 944.64
it

953.15 --> 957.88
you can find the comments at least

958.029 --> 972.13
settings is it in settings channel no

966.7 --> 976.69
permissions no community

972.13 --> 982.37
hold on I think I may have found it if

976.69 --> 983.9200000000001
yes I think I found it okay okay ah all

982.37 --> 999.58
right

983.92 --> 999.5799999999999
okay let's see okay

1004.34 --> 1015.6
what is his usual account name

1008.58 --> 1022.23
it's just full-out spelled right got too

1015.6 --> 1025.8600000000001
many blocks people too many socks

1022.23 --> 1028.31
especially it's just so many insane

1025.86 --> 1028.31
socks

1032.99 --> 1041.569
like if I technically if I decided to

1036.949 --> 1044.75
just remove all the bands just to click

1041.569 --> 1047.29
them all off it would take me probably

1044.75 --> 1050.0
10 minutes

1047.29 --> 1051.98
seriously non-stop just clicking it away

1050.0 --> 1054.77
it's gonna take me 10 minutes if I

1051.98 --> 1058.1
choose to do that which I don't right

1054.77 --> 1065.51
now just trying to find right the hand

1058.1 --> 1067.76
but it's not easy like they updated the

1065.51 --> 1070.64
first and right but still they don't

1067.76 --> 1073.55
have an efficient way to find a name in

1070.64 --> 1075.8600000000001
a giant pile of names because if you

1073.55 --> 1082.19
just search you just knew no because

1075.86 --> 1084.76
it's not directly in view so stupid so

1082.19 --> 1084.76
inefficient

1090.63 --> 1096.5
Oh God

1108.97 --> 1113.23
yeah by the way in the meantime

1118.64 --> 1123.5700000000002
what did he do yesterday this is gonna

1121.74 --> 1126.3
be tough actually looking and at the

1123.57 --> 1128.51
same time trying to think of what I did

1126.3 --> 1128.51
yesterday

1134.49 --> 1151.22
[Music]

1155.1 --> 1165.1789999999999
yeah I'm already over half I really hope

1161.32 --> 1165.1789999999999
I didn't scroll over his name

1187.43 --> 1198.67
what oh yes haven't found him yet though

1205.31 --> 1208.3899999999999
[Music]

1235.33 --> 1245.99
come on it should be easily what's

1242.919 --> 1249.0800000000002
recognizable with this stupid purple

1245.99 --> 1251.57
flower icon but I didn't find him so I

1249.08 --> 1256.1899999999998
don't think he's bent can't be I didn't

1251.57 --> 1259.99

no game trail the sky is beautiful I

1418.18 --> 1423.8200000000002
mean it reminds me of when I was a kid

1420.37 --> 1430.1499999999999
you know it's nice you know chemtrails

1423.82 --> 1434.02

gonna be 86 today it's degrees right now

1434.02 --> 1447.43
it's 5:00 in the morning

1435.07 --> 1450.4299999999998
Oh God look who just and I am just it's

1447.43 --> 1452.74
just that a GM just revealed himself to

1450.43 --> 1457.3300000000002
be you know like this guy is a stalker

1452.74 --> 1462.85
you know and I'm like he is like my

1457.33 --> 1465.73
Demetri in a way like nobody it's not

1462.85 --> 1469.33
funny because I don't care that he is

1465.73 --> 1473.47
nice I care that he constantly like

1469.33 --> 1476.1699999999998
blatantly socially misbehaves and

1473.47 --> 1480.25
violates just the trust of people and

1476.17 --> 1484.3000000000002
[ __ ] and just again this you know like

1480.25 --> 1487.75
if he had just not said it just not and

1484.3 --> 1489.43
then later in private told me like hey

1487.75 --> 1492.46
yeah I didn't know if you know but I've

1489.43 --> 1495.97
been this guy for like few months is

1492.46 --> 1499.57
that okay if I behaved like that I'd be

1495.97 --> 1503.5
yeah yeah I didn't get bothered at all

1499.57 --> 1505.72
by that character so if yeah in that

1503.5 --> 1508.63
case I would unbanned him and then just

1505.72 --> 1511.48
say okay if you behave exactly like that

1508.63 --> 1515.14
and don't start doing the same [ __ ] over

1511.48 --> 1518.83
and over again then you're okay yeah you

1515.14 --> 1524.0800000000002
are stalking me a gem you are absolutely

1518.83 --> 1526.56
you are the problem with that it's too

1524.08 --> 1530.4099999999999
too much of an unpredictable behavior

1526.56 --> 1532.45
for anyone that's um you know presenting

1530.41 --> 1534.7
himself to act right you know he doesn't

1532.45 --> 1537.4
know how to back down and he effectively

1534.7 --> 1543.1000000000001
doesn't respect other people because of

1537.4 --> 1545.8600000000001
it yeah yeah he told me in Jedi no hm I

1543.1 --> 1547.81
know you told me you were sorry and I

1545.86 --> 1551.1999999999998
said yeah that's that's good

1547.81 --> 1555.79
and thank you for just backing down but

1551.2 --> 1556.21
I you drive me nuts and now you did this

1555.79 --> 1559.84
again

1556.21 --> 1563.29
and why that's squirting you you need it

1559.84 --> 1566.83
you need it to be like oh I am a gem you

1563.29 --> 1570.46
had the need to do that thing again it's

1566.83 --> 1572.59
there's no other reason because this is

1570.46 --> 1577.15
not tactical and that's typically the

1572.59 --> 1583.75
problem and yeah he's sorry too he just

1577.15 --> 1586.66
did that right when you came on is that

1583.75 --> 1588.46
if someone is really a genuine person

1586.66 --> 1590.71
right they might not be right all the

1588.46 --> 1592.99
time but if someone is genuine they're

1590.71 --> 1596.71
gonna have a consistent behavior all the

1592.99 --> 1598.93
time right when he does that all right

1596.71 --> 1603.76
but it's a disruptive persistent

1598.93 --> 1606.1000000000001
behavior and I don't want that he's

1603.76 --> 1608.3799999999999
always been nice to me but you know and

1606.1 --> 1611.29
I in he's always been gracious to me so

1608.38 --> 1612.7600000000002
like I tried to return that you know you

1611.29 --> 1614.86
know I'd like to get to know him better

1612.76 --> 1616.72
in order to get to know his personality

1614.86 --> 1618.55
but but to jump around and act like

1616.72 --> 1619.9
other people I mean you know I'd have to

1618.55 --> 1622.6599999999999
act like I'd have to say that that's

1619.9 --> 1628.63
pretty frustrating if you knew that was

1622.66 --> 1631.69
happening but it's just he it's like he

1628.63 --> 1635.92
had thinks he has the right to be at my

1631.69 --> 1636.94
side you know nobody yeah that's that's

1635.92 --> 1639.04
called stalking

1636.94 --> 1642.6100000000001
that's called and that's what stalkers

1639.04 --> 1643.99
do they just they're told like no you

1642.61 --> 1646.03
got to take your distance you got to

1643.99 --> 1649.18
stop this or it's not gonna work and

1646.03 --> 1653.02
then they do it anyway that's what that

1649.18 --> 1655.3300000000002
is and stop stop playing - stop trying

1653.02 --> 1657.73
to guilt trip me no because he's old

1655.33 --> 1661.48
because no no not you he and Chad he's

1657.73 --> 1666.76
doing it right now in Chad stop guilt

1661.48 --> 1668.38
tripping stop it is you're emotionally

1666.76 --> 1670.09
connected because he's not a baller

1668.38 --> 1673.21
because a baller will never back down

1670.09 --> 1675.6399999999999
you know a baller will just keep keep

1673.21 --> 1677.68
trying to trick you over and over and

1675.64 --> 1681.039
over again you know try to find a little

1677.68 --> 1684.44
angle to get you like a Pharisee

1681.039 --> 1690.049
right and he is look he is not a

1684.44 --> 1692.3300000000002
Pharisee he's trying it's just that the

1690.049 --> 1695.899
in capability of doing it is just

1692.33 --> 1698.57
something I can't deal with you know

1695.899 --> 1702.139
that's what like it's hard and it's hard

1698.57 --> 1704.33
to find like real people like real

1702.139 --> 1707.629
people that really feel for other people

1704.33 --> 1709.999
it's like so hard and like you know when

1707.629 --> 1713.029
I found Tom man it was like it was like

1709.999 --> 1715.6100000000001
wow like an actual like a person I know

1713.029 --> 1717.769
it's real you know like that made my

1715.61 --> 1719.899
heart go great and then when I started

1717.769 --> 1721.94
talking to him he's always consistent

1719.899 --> 1723.559
all the time sometimes he says his

1721.94 --> 1725.6000000000001
opinion you know whether you like it or

1723.559 --> 1727.58
not you know but like like he's

1725.6 --> 1729.35
consistent and he's a good friend you

1727.58 --> 1731.9289999999999
know and I'm glad to have met him and a

1729.35 --> 1733.6999999999998
couple other people you know and during

1731.929 --> 1737.929
this journey but some people you just

1733.7 --> 1741.0800000000002
are just gonna be weird man you know all

1737.929 --> 1745.159
right yeah well the thing is you know hm

1741.08 --> 1747.619
he's like a decently okay guy you know

1745.159 --> 1749.779
yeah I kind of liked him it's just that

1747.619 --> 1753.23
he goes out of control and when he does

1749.779 --> 1755.6
he becomes very much the opposite he

1753.23 --> 1757.6100000000001
looked becomes like a rabid dog and he

1755.6 --> 1759.59
does that every single time and he's

1757.61 --> 1761.6589999999999
like yeah I got it under control and I

1759.59 --> 1763.1899999999998
like then let him know yeah I'm pissed

1761.659 --> 1765.74
off that you got out of control again

1763.19 --> 1768.44
and then because I say something about

1765.74 --> 1771.379
it he immediately bursts open again that

1768.44 --> 1773.809
[ __ ] you know and that had been so many

1771.379 --> 1775.6689999999999
it is kind of like cell phone yet

1773.809 --> 1779.779
complex right the hand has it a little

1775.669 --> 1781.8500000000001
bit himself as well and I just don't

1779.779 --> 1784.7
want to deal with that I don't want to

1781.85 --> 1788.86
be like a freaking animal tamer

1784.7 --> 1792.44
constantly busy and get trying to main

1788.86 --> 1796.2099999999998
key people's behavior on the control I

1792.44 --> 1799.6390000000001
don't want to do that it distracts me I

1796.21 --> 1802.549
was trying to do something they have

1799.639 --> 1805.639
this court they hit that anybody and you

1802.549 --> 1808.039
got to deal with it right just cuz oh it

1805.639 --> 1808.58
couldn't hold that hitting that inter

1808.039 --> 1812.0
button

1808.58 --> 1814.3999999999999
now you've got to deal with it right so

1812.0 --> 1818.35
anyway enough about that hm

1814.4 --> 1821.7800000000002
do whatever you like man it's just that

1818.35 --> 1824.59
you didn't need to do it that way you

1821.78 --> 1827.87
know I could have just told me like hey

1824.59 --> 1831.86
because by evening I don't even want to

1827.87 --> 1833.33
get into this anymore you know it's just

1831.86 --> 1836.24
don't like it that you did that

1833.33 --> 1840.05
let's move on so what did you want to

1836.24 --> 1843.68
come on about Steve oh no I just you

1840.05 --> 1845.96
know want to say that like you know the

1843.68 --> 1848.78
thing that came up today and in my heart

1845.96 --> 1851.0
you know to discuss is that you know

1848.78 --> 1854.96
when we're when we're searching for

1851.0 --> 1856.88
truth right and there's there's certain

1854.96 --> 1859.97
things we love especially God you know

1856.88 --> 1862.7900000000002
like especially things that you know

1859.97 --> 1865.01
concern God or if you're very passionate

1862.79 --> 1868.82
about Flat Earth and we love it so much

1865.01 --> 1870.83
you know that we don't want any anything

1868.82 --> 1874.04
else to come in and contaminate it with

1870.83 --> 1876.5
something you know and we all have

1874.04 --> 1878.3899999999999
different points of view on stuff but it

1876.5 --> 1881.33
doesn't make us right but there are

1878.39 --> 1884.5700000000002
various stuff that is set in stone but

1881.33 --> 1888.1299999999999
it's like we all need to just sharpen

1884.57 --> 1890.6899999999998
each other up you know and and try to

1888.13 --> 1892.5800000000002
try to help each other you know cuz no

1890.69 --> 1897.44
one's ever gonna have a hundred percent

1892.58 --> 1899.6599999999999
you know the the truth and we will find

1897.44 --> 1904.25
all that out when when we meet our

1899.66 --> 1907.3400000000001
Creator lay on journey I think at this

1904.25 --> 1909.53
point especially in society with the the

1907.34 --> 1913.37
world ready to make its move you need to

1909.53 --> 1915.35
stick together you know and really be a

1913.37 --> 1923.27
little a little gentler with each other

1915.35 --> 1929.6599999999999
you know right I agreed today that means

1923.27 --> 1932.51
notes wording yeah it does right but

1929.66 --> 1936.8000000000002
yeah it is because squirting eventually

1932.51 --> 1939.14
leads to seeking out something to keep

1936.8 --> 1943.76
the tension going and that typically

1939.14 --> 1946.65
leads to more and much more hostile type

1943.76 --> 1948.539
of management of your social situation

1946.65 --> 1952.5
naturally happens and you see it

1948.539 --> 1955.95
squirters southall yeas squirters they

1952.5 --> 1958.32
yeah they become obsessed with attacking

1955.95 --> 1961.289
other individuals and then it's like who

1958.32 --> 1963.0
are your friends and then they realize

1961.289 --> 1965.07
like no they have allies they don't

1963.0 --> 1967.409
really have any friends because they'll

1965.07 --> 1969.36
just turn on their friends for some

1967.409 --> 1970.95
temporary political reason if they

1969.36 --> 1973.37
needed to and went all the way

1970.95 --> 1979.32
that's something typically they all do

1973.37 --> 1981.6589999999999
yeah so it's also heartbreaking when no

1979.32 --> 1984.12
like we feel like we're a team you know

1981.659 --> 1986.3400000000001
like a platter CD and then when you ex

1984.12 --> 1988.4089999999999
someone especially someone above you and

1986.34 --> 1990.4189999999999
in the ranks a little bit like you

1988.409 --> 1993.39
expect them to have your back and and

1990.419 --> 1995.25
and to defend your to defend you and

1993.39 --> 1999.779
they don't man that's so heartbreaking

1995.25 --> 2004.82
it hurts you know what do like who what

1999.779 --> 2008.39
do you mean like I don't know like say I

2004.82 --> 2010.34
was to try to make a point and I'm not

2008.39 --> 2012.289
quite there yet and I just want the

2010.34 --> 2015.35
support of the people that are just kind

2012.289 --> 2016.85
of just above me and you know like

2015.35 --> 2018.9499999999998
smarter than me or whatever I want them

2016.85 --> 2021.1999999999998
to say yeah that's a good point but if

2018.95 --> 2026.059
they just kind of like blow it off it

2021.2 --> 2027.89
kind of hurts me in another way right

2026.059 --> 2031.1
did did did I do that

2027.89 --> 2035.39
no not you okay because I could you know

2031.1 --> 2038.1789999999999
sometimes I do because it's like like oh

2035.39 --> 2042.7990000000002
god I don't want to get into this you

2038.179 --> 2046.1000000000001
know I get into so I look so widely in

2042.799 --> 2048.05
the internet and all that and it's and I

2046.1 --> 2051.0499999999997
realized like there's like ten times

2048.05 --> 2053.51
more stuff I could effectively research

2051.05 --> 2058.6690000000003
but it's starting to give me all the

2053.51 --> 2061.4900000000002
headache so because I do it so much I'll

2058.669 --> 2063.71
say this is that like you've been very

2061.49 --> 2066.109
consistent in your behavior as far as

2063.71 --> 2068.2400000000002
what you want to talk about what you

2066.109 --> 2070.639
don't want to talk about and you're the

2068.24 --> 2072.3489999999997
same all the time and then when you do

2070.639 --> 2074.98
become emotional you're really an open

2072.349 --> 2078.53
book like I think you let out everything

2074.98 --> 2079.609
it's not like you you don't hide any

2078.53 --> 2086.69
part of your view

2079.609 --> 2088.7
you know well you know I really like

2086.69 --> 2090.679
that you say that but technically it's

2088.7 --> 2093.0789999999997
not entirely true there are things that

2090.679 --> 2096.739
I do hold back because there's just no

2093.079 --> 2099.759
way I can give it any kind of viable

2096.739 --> 2103.88
communication you know I do sit on

2099.759 --> 2107.63
frustrations sometimes or you know the

2103.88 --> 2109.88
weird thing is I have a very self

2107.63 --> 2113.4500000000003
contradicting type of experience

2109.88 --> 2115.4
sometimes because like at one point when

2113.45 --> 2117.529
I'm like in the zone when I'm doing this

2115.4 --> 2120.17
right everything falls into place it

2117.529 --> 2122.569
feels like yes I get it now this is why

2120.17 --> 2124.91
I was doing it we're all together here

2122.569 --> 2128.599
we're communicating people are handing

2124.91 --> 2130.8489999999997
me great information and I am very I can

2128.599 --> 2133.039
easily assimilated but then other times

2130.849 --> 2134.059
when it's not the show or something or

2133.039 --> 2137.0890000000004
doing something else

2134.059 --> 2139.489
I get like ah I'm trapped here I'm

2137.089 --> 2142.3089999999997
trapped on this stupid railroaded thing

2139.489 --> 2144.829
and people are not really even listening

2142.309 --> 2148.3390000000004
and I just I think I'm not getting

2144.829 --> 2151.94
anywhere and it yeah and then that is

2148.339 --> 2154.249
real and I get almost like how dare you

2151.94 --> 2156.41
put yourself in this situation why

2154.249 --> 2159.1299999999997
haven't you done something more extreme

2156.41 --> 2163.5389999999998
in this direction in that direction and

2159.13 --> 2166.5190000000002
so I have a lot of yeah weird

2163.539 --> 2168.98
contradictory feelings towards even what

2166.519 --> 2172.519
I do and even my own principle sometimes

2168.98 --> 2175.91
like on the other side I guess it's like

2172.519 --> 2178.609
the counterbalance but it is it is not

2175.91 --> 2180.769
undeveloped and that is also I guess

2178.609 --> 2185.15
what you sometimes see when I get really

2180.769 --> 2187.91
pissed off is that I like switch almost

2185.15 --> 2191.539
like in a in in another type of person

2187.91 --> 2193.819
in a way because I move certain levels

2191.539 --> 2195.92
of approach and like levels of

2193.819 --> 2199.099
aggression in a persistent way that just

2195.92 --> 2201.19
makes me seem to myself like I almost

2199.099 --> 2204.2000000000003
like I'm a different person and that is

2201.19 --> 2205.91
part of the thing because the things

2204.2 --> 2209.749
that are in the background certainly

2205.91 --> 2212.8999999999996
getting involved the those things can

2209.749 --> 2218.4199999999996
destroy me and I bring them forth

2212.9 --> 2221.4500000000003
to not destroy me but to kind of still

2218.42 --> 2225.65
do something effective with it it's

2221.45 --> 2229.7889999999998
difficult to explain but I do have a

2225.65 --> 2232.2200000000003
contradictory feelings even well sure of

2229.789 --> 2234.9500000000003
course I mean we're all I mean we're all

2232.22 --> 2237.68
still trying to find out what did it

2234.95 --> 2239.6299999999997
absolute best way to do stuff is there's

2237.68 --> 2242.18
there's stuff we struggle with right

2239.63 --> 2243.71
this one errand higher higher level and

2242.18 --> 2246.6499999999996
we're always gonna hold back something

2243.71 --> 2249.049
especially things we don't want people

2246.65 --> 2250.4300000000003
to see about us right that's natural as

2249.049 --> 2252.41
a human being right but what's

2250.43 --> 2254.8689999999997
perpetrating what really starts it is

2252.41 --> 2258.999
that like I remember when not like when

2254.869 --> 2261.7400000000002
I was like 12 or 13 probably like I

2258.999 --> 2263.66
that's when I come to was realizing that

2261.74 --> 2266.9599999999996
I was kind of smarter than my mom and my

2263.66 --> 2269.779
dad you know and I was like I was like

2266.96 --> 2273.259
wow I'm sometimes I come up with the

2269.779 --> 2274.73
best thing to do and my idea is not

2273.259 --> 2277.13
going to be the one that's good they're

2274.73 --> 2280.94
gonna go with and I realized that that's

2277.13 --> 2283.609
how life was is that there's a they

2280.94 --> 2286.369
don't think about things that they

2283.609 --> 2289.16
should be thinking about and it's like I

2286.369 --> 2291.38
expect them to do it but maybe they're

2289.16 --> 2296.8089999999997
not capable of it they get distracted by

2291.38 --> 2298.759
nonsense right everybody every not

2296.809 --> 2300.92
everybody can do what you do and then

2298.759 --> 2302.359
when you see them you're like why aren't

2300.92 --> 2306.38
they doing this or why aren't they doing

2302.359 --> 2310.19
that but I do it too I get distracted by

2306.38 --> 2312.259
nonsense a lot it's like yeah I see it

2310.19 --> 2314.299
you still get freaking distracted by it

2312.259 --> 2316.19
you know it's almost like this

2314.299 --> 2318.499
information that is just there as a

2316.19 --> 2321.859
distraction this ghosts is almost

2318.499 --> 2324.14
animate like a being of trying to get to

2321.859 --> 2326.569
you through people and through what

2324.14 --> 2328.999
you're doing it tries to get to you one

2326.569 --> 2331.4
way doesn't drop off it tries another

2328.999 --> 2333.799
way slips in and then it slips in just

2331.4 --> 2335.329
very calmly through conversation with a

2333.799 --> 2337.46
person that suddenly just out of nowhere

2335.329 --> 2343.579
brings it up and then it slips in that

2337.46 --> 2345.31
way other people don't realize that it's

2343.579 --> 2347.44
happening yeah

2345.31 --> 2349.12
you're like and you like spend most of

2347.44 --> 2351.46
your life trying to explain things to

2349.12 --> 2352.7799999999997
people right man I don't want to be

2351.46 --> 2354.55
hanging all people and explain

2352.78 --> 2356.7400000000002
everything all the time to everybody and

2354.55 --> 2358.21
then when I say something that they

2356.74 --> 2360.0699999999997
don't understand completely

2358.21 --> 2362.38
they look at me like I'm the dumbass and

2360.07 --> 2364.9
they have the crowd behind them but you

2362.38 --> 2367.57
know the masses you know to agree with

2364.9 --> 2373.15
them like I'm the outcast now it's the

2367.57 --> 2380.98
dumbass consensus yeah we're dumb but

2373.15 --> 2382.75
we're more than you guys I'm trying to

2380.98 --> 2385.9900000000002
help you you know and you don't

2382.75 --> 2388.87
understand and that's how life is is

2385.99 --> 2391.06
like we're gonna spend our time really

2388.87 --> 2393.16
like it's our job to help people and

2391.06 --> 2395.5
it's very frustrating it's like

2393.16 --> 2397.72
everybody has different gifts right some

2395.5 --> 2400.69
people can fix cars I can't fix a car

2397.72 --> 2403.24
you know what I mean some people did you

2400.69 --> 2405.28
know you know I don't know there's other

2403.24 --> 2407.5
industries right where they're very

2405.28 --> 2409.48
smarter they're very artistic and they

2407.5 --> 2411.49
can do those things and that's their job

2409.48 --> 2415.12
that's how they're gonna put their

2411.49 --> 2418.66
impact on the world and sometimes what

2415.12 --> 2421.99
we have is a burden you know is that is

2418.66 --> 2424.2999999999997
that it you know it's like if you know

2421.99 --> 2425.83
something that they don't and sometimes

2424.3 --> 2428.65
the truth like you could tell them the

2425.83 --> 2430.54
truth in it and they hate you for it and

2428.65 --> 2432.9100000000003
they'd rather believe the TV that's

2430.54 --> 2436.0
lying to them and degrading them you

2432.91 --> 2440.14
know and it's just it's weird how that

2436.0 --> 2442.96
fight is how they could believe the

2440.14 --> 2450.72
television over someone that they know

2442.96 --> 2456.37
and love their whole lives you know but

2450.72 --> 2459.0099999999998
it's because yeah how much time do you

2456.37 --> 2462.22
spend interacting and solving social

2459.01 --> 2466.51
issues with ones you love versus just

2462.22 --> 2469.18
staring at a screen timewise you know

2466.51 --> 2471.55
because the problem is also because

2469.18 --> 2476.96
television and all that programming is

2471.55 --> 2479.3
all one-way direction in a way right

2476.96 --> 2481.339
you don't get offended because she don't

2479.3 --> 2483.98
really get confronted with issues and

2481.339 --> 2485.9
that with people you know that becomes a

2483.98 --> 2487.88
problem because eventually you'll bump

2485.9 --> 2491.39
into situations with one that you're

2487.88 --> 2493.2200000000003
gonna conflict over and then you have to

2491.39 --> 2495.56
deal with it or walk away the television

2493.22 --> 2497.6299999999997
doesn't really do that it just keeps on

2495.56 --> 2498.52
going and going and you can try to

2497.63 --> 2502.28
ignore it

2498.52 --> 2505.79
but yeah it's okay and you get used to

2502.28 --> 2508.28
that you get used to that other way of

2505.79 --> 2511.339
socially interacting and attaining

2508.28 --> 2513.53
information like that sure because it's

2511.339 --> 2515.77
kind of a social interaction replacement

2513.53 --> 2518.3300000000004
device really the television you know

2515.77 --> 2520.04
and also people don't understand like

2518.33 --> 2522.29
the science behind it right like that

2520.04 --> 2525.38
like they're like every time you see

2522.29 --> 2527.7799999999997
spinning graphics or flashing lights or

2525.38 --> 2529.9100000000003
different change in camera directions

2527.78 --> 2532.2200000000003
all the time that has an effect on your

2529.91 --> 2534.29
brain on your subconscious yes now if

2532.22 --> 2536.359
you're a then it doesn't affect you

2534.29 --> 2539.72
right but if you are not aware of it

2536.359 --> 2542.0299999999997
right the hypnotism in controlling your

2539.72 --> 2543.95
subconscious is a real thing and if you

2542.03 --> 2548.5600000000004
think they're not doing they are you

2543.95 --> 2551.81
know that's naive you know well they are

2548.56 --> 2555.349
like are they doing it for that reason

2551.81 --> 2557.9
or is that thing simply a natural side

2555.349 --> 2560.78
effect that is either overlooked or

2557.9 --> 2562.58
sneakily planned into my gravel errs

2560.78 --> 2564.2900000000004
because that's what they like to do and

2562.58 --> 2565.91
they like to know things that nobody

2564.29 --> 2567.89
else knows and then make sneaky little

2565.91 --> 2569.81
plans with it no long run and then

2567.89 --> 2574.1299999999997
nobody saw it coming that's what grabbed

2569.81 --> 2576.589
lers really love to do so for example 3d

2574.13 --> 2579.92
gaming you know especially shooters and

2576.589 --> 2582.619
[ __ ] I used to be very very fascinated

2579.92 --> 2585.4700000000003
with that like hunter instinct kind of

2582.619 --> 2587.33
pulled me in but eventually over time

2585.47 --> 2593.1189999999997
especially as graphics got better

2587.33 --> 2597.5299999999997
I got 3d sickness and worse and worse

2593.119 --> 2600.29
and worse and worse until the point

2597.53 --> 2604.7900000000004
where half-life 2 which was like an

2600.29 --> 2607.07
amazing 3d engines looked so real that I

2604.79 --> 2609.56
played it for the first time in half an

2607.07 --> 2610.7000000000003
hour straight and then I literally just

2609.56 --> 2612.95
turn off Mike

2610.7 --> 2614.99
just like that off and then I ran to the

2612.95 --> 2617.75
toilet and hang over it for half an hour

2614.99 --> 2621.3199999999997
because I felt like I was going to eject

2617.75 --> 2626.72
my entire organ system so much tension

2621.32 --> 2632.27
it was so bad like what is this I felt

2626.72 --> 2636.89
like I hope it and after the I kind of

2632.27 --> 2640.49
stopped playing 3d games this is what's

2636.89 --> 2642.23
insane right is that like when me we had

2640.49 --> 2644.4199999999996
half our lives there was really no

2642.23 --> 2646.94
computers or really the internet wasn't

2644.42 --> 2648.86
really great right and then we had half

2646.94 --> 2651.38
of our life where it was phenomenal and

2648.86 --> 2654.1400000000003
great right and it's like and it's like

2651.38 --> 2657.11
going into 3d you know realistic and

2654.14 --> 2660.97
then a virtual reality right I was

2657.11 --> 2663.8900000000003
looking for it I wanted that [ __ ] and I

2660.97 --> 2669.35
realization that when the the 3d was

2663.89 --> 2671.33
crappy it was like amazing this could be

2669.35 --> 2676.04
so much better now it's like 20 years

2671.33 --> 2679.25
later it's like it's amazing and up and

2676.04 --> 2683.18
there to kill you like what is this it's

2679.25 --> 2685.19
not what I wanted this arm I think of

2683.18 --> 2688.2799999999997
this sewing my kid it's right who are

2685.19 --> 2690.5
like 17 and 19 right now they've lived

2688.28 --> 2693.38
their whole lives with computers being

2690.5 --> 2695.57
great right screen and from when they

2693.38 --> 2700.13
were 5 years old you know that is me I

2695.57 --> 2703.8500000000004
got my Commodore 64 my brother had no

2700.13 --> 2706.88
and when I was six I that is where like

2703.85 --> 2710.54
I lost myself for the first time really

2706.88 --> 2713.63
I've behind that thing and I get so much

2710.54 --> 2715.88
there I think that's where I started

2713.63 --> 2718.94
level designing because there were like

2715.88 --> 2721.1600000000003
programs for that for games and then you

2718.94 --> 2724.57
build your own levels that was there in

2721.16 --> 2729.46
the freeway in in the in the 80s

2724.57 --> 2732.86
really in the 80s boola - boola -

2729.46 --> 2736.67
construction kit I literally made an

2732.86 --> 2740.1800000000003
entire game design based on that thing

2736.67 --> 2744.11
and I've spent like over three years

2740.18 --> 2746.93
with that 3d editor making like 26

2744.11 --> 2749.69
of the most brilliant complex puzzle

2746.93 --> 2751.79
levels I've ever come across because I

2749.69 --> 2753.26
wanted to make it better than all the

2751.79 --> 2756.11
other balderdash games that were

2753.26 --> 2760.01
officially published because I could do

2756.11 --> 2762.17
that with that engine it that was like

2760.01 --> 2766.4900000000002
the first Minecraft you know minecraft

2762.17 --> 2768.7400000000002
is completely pointless anyway that was

2766.49 --> 2770.3599999999997
my kids you know it was a good way to

2768.74 --> 2771.5899999999997
interact with them when they lived with

2770.36 --> 2773.57
their mother and stuff I played

2771.59 --> 2777.53
Minecraft with them but I never

2773.57 --> 2780.32
understood that game right but like 3d

2777.53 --> 2784.67
or bullet - construction kid was my

2780.32 --> 2785.9900000000002
minecraft in the language I gotta ask

2784.67 --> 2788.54
you this what do you think of the next

2785.99 --> 2791.33
generation right like like my kids like

2788.54 --> 2793.64
what do you think the effect of all of

2791.33 --> 2796.04
this screen time for their whole lives

2793.64 --> 2797.5099999999998
without you know like like my oldest son

2796.04 --> 2799.49
goes outside and plays basketball and

2797.51 --> 2802.34
stuff like that and he like likes to be

2799.49 --> 2804.29
out and my youngest one loves game and

2802.34 --> 2811.1600000000003
in first shooter games and all that

2804.29 --> 2818.84
stuff and he's a kid all that has to

2811.16 --> 2822.56
have a super kind of actor while this

2818.84 --> 2826.88
has been around for twenty more than 20

2822.56 --> 2830.9
years probably more like and this is a

2826.88 --> 2835.94
pre programmable graph this entire thing

2830.9 --> 2839.27
this is like told exactly how to program

2835.94 --> 2841.25
it with pictures everything everything

2839.27 --> 2848.6
about it I worked it out in detail and

2841.25 --> 2851.09
never nobody ever did it if I could

2848.6 --> 2854.24
program I could probably do this myself

2851.09 --> 2855.86
but it's just pretty complex thing you

2854.24 --> 2857.4799999999996
know there are so many things and they

2855.86 --> 2861.9700000000003
all have to cross connect like

2857.48 --> 2864.89
everything every type of block has a

2861.97 --> 2868.43
pre-programmed response to everything

2864.89 --> 2871.3399999999997
else and it's very systematic very it's

2868.43 --> 2877.2799999999997
a giant's multi dimensional puzzle of

2871.34 --> 2877.7000000000003
mechanics basically mysterious this is

2877.28 --> 2881.2400000000002
like

2877.7 --> 2885.2599999999998
i-i integrated materials it's like well

2881.24 --> 2890.7099999999996
the orc bricks PVC rubber triplex glass

2885.26 --> 2894.98
steel tin and there's lasers electricity

2890.71 --> 2898.01
barrier beams very interesting all kinds

2894.98 --> 2904.21
of weird like spawning devices and [ __ ]

2898.01 --> 2904.21
and it's just mega huge puzzle potential

2904.75 --> 2912.68
so what do you pay even like a shooter

2908.24 --> 2915.68
system in it if you wouldn't affect have

2912.68 --> 2918.6499999999996
on people right during this time right

2915.68 --> 2920.359
like like do you think that they've been

2918.65 --> 2922.9700000000003
putting out all these games and stuff

2920.359 --> 2925.5789999999997
like for our kids like to play like in

2922.97 --> 2927.8289999999997
us - right like especially if we were

2925.579 --> 2929.3900000000003
like eager the computer age and stuff

2927.829 --> 2931.309
but like do you think all this

2929.39 --> 2935.049
stimulation and all this first shooter

2931.309 --> 2938.1800000000003
stuff is like is like going to come into

2935.049 --> 2941.48
like our reality is like something that

2938.18 --> 2943.5789999999997
you know like that screen time was just

2941.48 --> 2947.45
like programming them to do you know

2943.579 --> 2949.819
like do you see it as like a something

2947.45 --> 2952.359
nefarious that they've done right no

2949.819 --> 2956.23
what they do is they railroad

2952.359 --> 2960.8489999999997
association of story or scenario and

2956.23 --> 2963.53
then what are you doing during that time

2960.849 --> 2967.2200000000003
you know in that game what are you doing

2963.53 --> 2969.17
some basic behavior with that feel of

2967.22 --> 2971.93
what is going on is happening because

2969.17 --> 2975.559
that will typically pre-program you to a

2971.93 --> 2978.44
certain type of state of mind or actions

2975.559 --> 2981.049
you will take in response to comparable

2978.44 --> 2984.17
comparable real-life situations that at

2981.049 --> 2986.5099999999998
least feel like that so it just kind of

2984.17 --> 2990.14
real erode your behavior like

2986.51 --> 2993.3190000000004
conditioning especially the 3d virtual

2990.14 --> 2995.7799999999997
reality stuff that right now it looks so

2993.319 --> 2998.599
real that you can almost not tell from

2995.78 --> 3002.23
reality what it is you know like it

2998.599 --> 3004.48
looks that real are we yeah I know it's

3002.23 --> 3007.0
it's um it's it's amazing and I wonder

3004.48 --> 3010.45
like cuz like psychologically right

3007.0 --> 3012.11
being on a screen from from a kid all

3010.45 --> 3014.6899999999996
the way through

3012.11 --> 3017.1200000000003
you know today right like would there

3014.69 --> 3018.89
was no other time in history that you

3017.12 --> 3021.5299999999997
can go about to exit unless you've got a

3018.89 --> 3022.8799999999997
pre flooded you know whatever technology

3021.53 --> 3025.78
they had because they were building

3022.88 --> 3028.94
pyramids right but like but like but

3025.78 --> 3031.2200000000003
like there's no time in in recent

3028.94 --> 3033.59
history where anybody's been you know

3031.22 --> 3036.5
that stimulated all the time where they

3033.59 --> 3039.4100000000003
can find out everything right now on the

3036.5 --> 3041.33
touch of a button you know before you if

3039.41 --> 3044.33
you didn't have a question right if you

3041.33 --> 3045.7999999999997
disagree yeah you had to ask your dad or

3044.33 --> 3048.47
something you know like how many teeth

3045.8 --> 3050.48
does a hippo have you know but now it's

3048.47 --> 3052.81
it's just automatic screen screen screen

3050.48 --> 3055.34
screen all day long news all day long

3052.81 --> 3061.64
you know what do you think that does to

3055.34 --> 3065.3500000000004
a person wait it physically pacifies

3061.64 --> 3068.12
them basically yeah because you do less

3065.35 --> 3071.7799999999997
physically more mentally and with your

3068.12 --> 3075.5899999999997
senses and that kind of railroads that

3071.78 --> 3078.02
activity set up of active observation

3075.59 --> 3082.48
thinking maybe hands activity for

3078.02 --> 3086.5099999999998
communication and not and keeping still

3082.48 --> 3091.6
basically that will be then grinded into

3086.51 --> 3093.8
how the brain is developed so ya know I

3091.6 --> 3096.71
really I mean do you think that we're

3093.8 --> 3098.3900000000003
like you know in the end times you know

3096.71 --> 3101.2
cuz I've had that feeling that we might

3098.39 --> 3104.54
be no they're like it's just weird that

3101.2 --> 3107.33
every country is in full agreement with

3104.54 --> 3109.52
like how you know like how quantum of

3107.33 --> 3112.22
consciousness he was saying that like

3109.52 --> 3115.52
there's no dissenting opinions like not

3112.22 --> 3118.85
know businesses no celebrity saying hey

3115.52 --> 3122.12
you know like this this lockdown is bad

3118.85 --> 3125.33
we need to get back to work or no smear

3122.12 --> 3128.24
campaigns of an opposite opinion of this

3125.33 --> 3131.09
they just all shut down just perfectly

3128.24 --> 3132.9199999999996
in order with no dissension well that's

3131.09 --> 3135.32
because they don't feel there is any

3132.92 --> 3138.11
viable free speech available for them

3135.32 --> 3139.7000000000003
they probably are talking about that

3138.11 --> 3141.17
stuff but they're doing it secretly

3139.7 --> 3143.45
among them one another because they're

3141.17 --> 3144.75
afraid if they're going to speak out or

3143.45 --> 3146.7
somebody will

3144.75 --> 3149.46
start to do that that they will get all

3146.7 --> 3151.7599999999998
these fines and all that [ __ ] yeah

3149.46 --> 3155.91
that's what you're really afraid of but

3151.76 --> 3158.78
yet that's just because of yeah the way

3155.91 --> 3162.12
the things have been maneuvered these

3158.78 --> 3163.92
ridiculous things I don't know if enough

3162.12 --> 3166.56
people are just sick of it and come

3163.92 --> 3169.77
together you know I I described it

3166.56 --> 3171.66
thoroughly yesterday eventually if they

3169.77 --> 3173.6
just push too hard with too much

3171.66 --> 3176.7599999999998
nonsense and there's going to be damage

3173.6 --> 3181.2
the damage is there because of it then

3176.76 --> 3184.2900000000004
eventually that unrest will turn into

3181.2 --> 3187.35
violence and people will be like yeah

3184.29 --> 3192.18
this is it's this is over now we don't

3187.35 --> 3195.6
care anymore we're just gonna stop it

3192.18 --> 3197.52
from do you think the way it is do you

3195.6 --> 3199.83
think it's weird that like they kind of

3197.52 --> 3201.63
put out that false dichotomy right where

3199.83 --> 3204.24
it's like either you sit in your

3201.63 --> 3206.52
Hawking's and you comply to everything

3204.24 --> 3209.9399999999996
or you go down to the Capitol building

3206.52 --> 3211.59
in protest right but in reality like if

3209.94 --> 3213.84
you're going to protest you're really

3211.59 --> 3216.27
just begging them for a permission you

3213.84 --> 3218.13
know when when we're in reality what

3216.27 --> 3220.38
would really be the worst thing for them

3218.13 --> 3222.9
is for us to just go back to our daily

3220.38 --> 3226.26
lives you know without any kind of

3222.9 --> 3227.9700000000003
protest just not listen yeah but the

3226.26 --> 3230.61
problem is is you're gonna get all these

3227.97 --> 3233.31
fines and all that there's clearly two

3230.61 --> 3236.55
big problems you know business run on

3233.31 --> 3238.5
making profit so if that is constantly

3236.55 --> 3241.38
in under danger then it doesn't work

3238.5 --> 3245.31
anymore so protesting does have to

3241.38 --> 3247.65
happen but yeah if there is no

3245.31 --> 3251.2799999999997
responsibility protests are technically

3247.65 --> 3254.4300000000003
like a warning sign from the public like

3251.28 --> 3257.13
this is wrong you have to stop this now

3254.43 --> 3260.52
I'm doing there's no response to it it

3257.13 --> 3265.92
grows worse and worse and then [ __ ] hits

3260.52 --> 3268.02
the fan like the tractor start yeah you

3265.92 --> 3270.51
know pumping out [ __ ] all over the

3268.02 --> 3274.44
courthouse in France and in other places

3270.51 --> 3276.8100000000004
yeah maybe they'll they'll torch it or

3274.44 --> 3278.099
something I don't know but that's what

3276.81 --> 3282.18
protests

3278.099 --> 3284.339
protesting itself is just a sign like

3282.18 --> 3287.3999999999996
yeah there's people fed up about this

3284.339 --> 3290.819
they don't want this to continue so they

3287.4 --> 3292.619
can and they will speak out about it at

3290.819 --> 3296.91
first have mostly spread awareness

3292.619 --> 3299.19
somehow but yeah if it just sticks to

3296.91 --> 3301.769
that that's not enough but hey this

3299.19 --> 3303.93
situation it will push it anyway you

3301.769 --> 3306.029
know if they keep on doing this if if

3303.93 --> 3310.229
more businesses are ruined the more

3306.029 --> 3311.91
lives are ruined then it's not about the

3310.229 --> 3313.6499999999996
protest it's about those things having

3311.91 --> 3317.339
happened and things are being ruled and

3313.65 --> 3320.759
people are gonna respond they are yeah

3317.339 --> 3322.979
cuz when something is taken from you it

3320.759 --> 3324.93
doesn't matter if your neighbor is it if

3322.979 --> 3328.019
some freaking criminal or if the

3324.93 --> 3330.47
government does it you're hurt then

3328.019 --> 3334.769
you're damaged you're a damaged party

3330.47 --> 3338.4889999999996
its inner it's like part of nature that

3334.769 --> 3341.4599999999996
you must respond to it that's basically

3338.489 --> 3345.479
the slogan good god makes you respond

3341.46 --> 3348.96
and you can either act to kind of take

3345.479 --> 3352.769
it back or something restore it or yeah

3348.96 --> 3354.859
blow up and end up pretty much damaging

3352.769 --> 3354.859
yourself

3355.069 --> 3359.239
it's getting pretty contentious out

3357.509 --> 3363.2690000000002
there I just I just I fear that

3359.239 --> 3365.19
especially in America that if protesters

3363.269 --> 3366.93
keep it up I'm I'm afraid that the

3365.19 --> 3368.88
military's gonna mow them down you know

3366.93 --> 3370.2889999999998
it's like it's very scary to me just

3368.88 --> 3372.42
think about that you know yeah but

3370.289 --> 3374.9
what's gonna happen after that you know

3372.42 --> 3378.42
a if military starts mowing people down

3374.9 --> 3381.9300000000003
then yeah it's over then it's all over

3378.42 --> 3383.4
all of it the entire pretense of like

3381.93 --> 3386.969
the last 50 years

3383.4 --> 3389.369
you know the pretense of a civilization

3386.969 --> 3393.18
will be very much over if that happens

3389.369 --> 3395.759
so is that gonna be worth it do they

3393.18 --> 3398.549
need that to happen

3395.759 --> 3400.559
can they account for that happening

3398.549 --> 3402.269
that's what you got to think of every

3400.559 --> 3405.4500000000003
time you bring up these nightmare

3402.269 --> 3408.3289999999997
visions about sudden mass murders sudden

3405.45 --> 3411.6299999999997
terror custody doesn't just happen it

3408.329 --> 3414.36
never does a paranoid

3411.63 --> 3416.88
it does everything ends everything I

3414.36 --> 3419.01
know I bring it up because it's like

3416.88 --> 3421.71
it's like it's one of those things it's

3419.01 --> 3424.3500000000004
like you realize it's a good thing to

3421.71 --> 3427.05
get really close to your Savior you know

3424.35 --> 3430.74
and like really get close to your to

3427.05 --> 3433.5
your Creator because you know in case

3430.74 --> 3436.7999999999997
things happen in a very bad way you know

3433.5 --> 3438.93
you hope I mean you just as long it's

3436.8 --> 3441.8100000000004
gonna go as it's written right I mean we

3438.93 --> 3443.7599999999998
know that you know if if you if you read

3441.81 --> 3446.93
revelations it's going to go that way

3443.76 --> 3449.82
but like if you know that you're saved

3446.93 --> 3452.3999999999996
there should be some measure of peace

3449.82 --> 3454.38
and comfort you just hope that enough

3452.4 --> 3456.6600000000003
people get saved before anything like

3454.38 --> 3457.35
that happens you know nothing like that

3456.66 --> 3459.7799999999997
will happen

3457.35 --> 3461.3399999999997
this is not the age of Revelations this

3459.78 --> 3465.8700000000003
is just the apocalypse

3461.34 --> 3468.32
oh the under yeah that's it that's

3465.87 --> 3470.79
that's it

3468.32 --> 3472.8300000000004
that's the only thing that's happened

3470.79 --> 3476.0099999999998
this is not the end of the world their

3472.83 --> 3478.68
bat or [ __ ] or like a five hundred years

3476.01 --> 3481.0800000000004
from now it's nothing this is all fake

3478.68 --> 3484.5
this is all Satanists basically

3481.08 --> 3487.44
emulating biblical scenarios through

3484.5 --> 3489.6
mind control and pre-programming just to

3487.44 --> 3494.07
convince everybody that it's the end of

3489.6 --> 3496.68
the world in a very visceral way it's

3494.07 --> 3498.57
not hair is not happening how many

3496.68 --> 3501.35
things that we learn about our just

3498.57 --> 3507.2400000000002
think are just our own mind creations

3501.35 --> 3509.88
every time this is not that time this is

3507.24 --> 3511.83
not the end of the world I really want

3509.88 --> 3514.56
to get through to you with this it's not

3511.83 --> 3516.24
the end of the world it is it's still a

3514.56 --> 3519.0299999999997
good time to get close to the Creator

3516.24 --> 3522.18
though and be close to God there is no

3519.03 --> 3523.05
time when that's not the case I love

3522.18 --> 3526.44
that okay

3523.05 --> 3528.27
I want at least that's where the fruits

3526.44 --> 3531.4500000000003
comes from that's where the rewards are

3528.27 --> 3534.33
it's naturally rewarding to do things

3531.45 --> 3538.29
right you got it

3534.33 --> 3539.88
you gotta fend off the seductions and

3538.29 --> 3542.2799999999997
that is really difficult because this

3539.88 --> 3544.13
age is an age of Crabill it's an age of

3542.28 --> 3546.44
massive seduction and

3544.13 --> 3549.6800000000003
this suasion and mind control that's the

3546.44 --> 3552.41
big that's the main challenge now it's

3549.68 --> 3555.56
the age of illusions I called it you

3552.41 --> 3558.5
know the age of illusions this piece

3555.56 --> 3561.62
it's a long period and its pinnacle now

3558.5 --> 3565.76
because now the technology is able to

3561.62 --> 3568.4
perfect all these illusions see that's

3565.76 --> 3571.46
why first it was just good storytelling

3568.4 --> 3573.4900000000002
from priests from Liars they would bring

3571.46 --> 3577.25
out these image pictures and paintings

3573.49 --> 3580.0099999999998
now you got freaking media you got

3577.25 --> 3583.04
Internet you got 3d computer games you

3580.01 --> 3585.3500000000004
got the high tech music you got so many

3583.04 --> 3586.16
freaking things and crazy grabbers all

3585.35 --> 3590.24
using it

3586.16 --> 3594.35
yeah well it's thanks various it's the

3590.24 --> 3597.41
pinnacle of the age of illusions but

3594.35 --> 3599.54

3597.41 --> 3601.94
