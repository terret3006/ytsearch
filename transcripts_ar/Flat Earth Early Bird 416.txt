everywhere though

110.75 --> 119.62
and yeah there has been raiding every

113.45 --> 123.17
now and then but ya know looks more like

119.62 --> 134.63
an autumn day than a winter's day really

123.17 --> 137.09
so there's some coals going around

134.63 --> 139.28
though I don't really seem to be

137.09 --> 142.73
affected but I do have like a raspy

139.28 --> 144.65
throat thing comes back and forth every

142.73 --> 148.22
now and then but yeah you know I used

144.65 --> 151.19
little silver and everything and I very

148.22 --> 154.209
familiar with how that quickly gets that

151.19 --> 161.26
away so hmm

154.209 --> 164.15
right so see you in chat hm was first

161.26 --> 169.42

Jeffrey bill and a koala

182.969 --> 192.31
infections infections whatever man

187.5 --> 195.069
it's just metabolic overhaul you could

192.31 --> 197.109
call it an inflammation maybe if that is

195.069 --> 202.569
the case but to call it an infection

197.109 --> 205.34900000000002
that's too specific for me and don't

202.569 --> 214.47
think that's really it

205.349 --> 219.75
what anyway whatever hmm a yellow tank

214.47 --> 219.75
michael roark good servant

222.64 --> 229.29999999999998
Jeffrey bill no wait you were there

225.43 --> 234.04000000000002
already huh yeah I got to see you on

229.3 --> 236.67000000000002
this Sunday start a little early got

234.04 --> 236.67
impatience

246.56 --> 255.06900000000002
but anyway yeah yesterday was quite a

249.44 --> 255.069
blast to hang out I really had to yeah I

255.459 --> 260.44
had a lot of energy and I've been active

258.23 --> 265.61
up till like in the middle of the night

260.44 --> 266.33
like it's five o'clock or something it's

265.61 --> 273.73
crazy

266.33 --> 277.82
but there was a lot going on a lot I

273.73 --> 282.64000000000004
hope I remember everything it's just

277.82 --> 282.64
almost non-stop I also watched a movie

283.93 --> 294.23
see yeah there was no own Benjamin but

291.77 --> 297.919
there was some modern-day debates going

294.23 --> 300.68
on first Nathan this is what I saw like

297.919 --> 304.03999999999996
after the debates and all that Nathan

300.68 --> 308.419
Thompson had been on the modern-day

304.04 --> 310.58000000000004
debates apparently two weeks ago I think

308.419 --> 314.81
I heard of it back then I didn't watch

310.58 --> 316.94
it but he premiered he re streamed that

314.81 --> 319.9
on his channel yesterday and that was

316.94 --> 319.9
pretty impressive

323.14 --> 335.64
see oh yeah sing-along bear on D life

329.05 --> 338.769
that was kind of fun just hang around

335.64 --> 338.769
[Music]

340.27 --> 343.229
let's see

363.02 --> 365.77
right

366.3 --> 372.03000000000003
yeah after that I watched that movie

369.06 --> 376.94
which was kind of like an ah pick for me

372.03 --> 381.15
these days but kind of popped up Netflix

376.94 --> 382.96999999999997
it was Dracula I'm told and I thought oh

381.15 --> 387.39
god this is probably going to be totally

382.97 --> 388.14000000000004
lame but no it wasn't was really

387.39 --> 394.68
impressive

388.14 --> 397.38
and historically interesting also so but

394.68 --> 401.52
it was very dark it was very very dark

397.38 --> 405.0
but there was it was all genuine

401.52 --> 409.91999999999996
character I really liked it with so much

405.0 --> 412.77
historical context and yeah it was made

409.92 --> 415.35
in a way that if you yeah allowed the

412.77 --> 418.59
supernet if you allow entertaining the

415.35 --> 422.76000000000005
supernatural to be a possibility then

418.59 --> 424.59
this movie could potentially be

422.76 --> 428.45
considered somewhat historically

424.59 --> 432.09
accurate or somewhat in that direction

428.45 --> 434.82
reenactment this is fascinating it's a

432.09 --> 440.17999999999995
really fascinating movie I thought it

434.82 --> 440.18
was really good anyway

440.81 --> 447.78000000000003
right and after that pretty interesting

444.45 --> 450.69
event I was very reactive in Chad it was

447.78 --> 457.44
on the modern-day debates again it went

450.69 --> 460.08
live very very late I think it's like

457.44 --> 463.23
the late evening by then in the US I

460.08 --> 468.95
said five o'clock Amsterdam time for

463.23 --> 476.13
four hours yeah it's the late evening

468.95 --> 480.0
anyway it was atheism versus versus

476.13 --> 484.55
Christianity and it was some really

480.0 --> 484.55
hard-hitting stuff and what it was

484.639 --> 489.8
but eventually it just spiraled out of

487.189 --> 492.28900000000004
control it became a total almost like

489.8 --> 496.40000000000003
flat earther baller situation except not

492.289 --> 498.979
controlled really but yeah that was the

496.4 --> 501.169
lady was the atheist and she got so

498.979 --> 503.56899999999996
triggered eventually that the only thing

501.169 --> 506.06
she kept focusing on is just trying to

503.569 --> 508.189
define the motivations of her opponent

506.06 --> 511.49
while they were just trying to ask

508.189 --> 514.039
pretty tough straightforward questions

511.49 --> 515.899
about the nature of what and how she

514.039 --> 518.209
believed in and she like avoided that

515.899 --> 520.339
[ __ ] for like 20 minutes it's very

518.209 --> 522.05
annoying like oh you're trying to do

520.339 --> 525.6800000000001
this trying to do that and not answering

522.05 --> 530.899
the question my god so but it was

525.68 --> 533.329
interesting to see recommended my in my

530.899 --> 538.43
perspective like the atheists just had

533.329 --> 542.3
no control whatsoever over the over the

538.43 --> 544.31
depth of the actual discussion it seemed

542.3 --> 546.3199999999999
at some point like she wasn't really

544.31 --> 551.3499999999999
willing to debate she wouldn't even call

546.32 --> 554.089
it the bet she had said a discussion or

551.35 --> 556.16
yeah anything other than today it was

554.089 --> 559.6700000000001
very telling anyway I was kind of

556.16 --> 562.6899999999999
interested at it and kept on watching

559.67 --> 562.6899999999999
and watching watching

566.029 --> 574.259
right well eventually like way at the

569.94 --> 578.0400000000001
end after wasting everyone's time a long

574.259 --> 579.99
time she did kind of settle down and say

578.04 --> 582.36
like okay it's technically northern

579.99 --> 586.8
atheists is more like in certain type of

582.36 --> 589.29
fact nos taken but she was just she felt

586.8 --> 591.12
was so defensive so like all your

589.29 --> 593.13
personally attacked me you're trying to

591.12 --> 598.73
do this like divining the attack

593.13 --> 598.73
strategy of the opponent instead of just

598.91 --> 608.04
being confident about her assertions and

605.1 --> 617.22
that was super telling so I thought it

608.04 --> 620.269
was good but not it was more just very

617.22 --> 623.6700000000001
telling and psychologically telling Elsa

620.269 --> 625.829
because yeah with all the red herrings

623.67 --> 627.899
constantly in straw man's eventually

625.829 --> 630.899
there wasn't much of a debate just like

627.899 --> 633.75
typically what happens between ballers

630.899 --> 638.51
and flat-earthers when they allow

633.75 --> 638.51
themselves to yeah

642.59 --> 655.39
right hello Dorian Gray oh how funny

650.06 --> 655.39
Christ I said it he said

660.99 --> 671.8100000000001
doesn't really there's an s in there

665.34 --> 671.8100000000001
that's too many asses mmm anyway

678.04 --> 681.63
hello Nathan Oakley

689.37 --> 696.21
what was going on again yeah I have to

692.85 --> 698.61
show yesterday I don't remember

696.21 --> 704.46
I remember that I was over at Jose's at

698.61 --> 709.14
least and this time I think yeah it was

704.46 --> 713.25
rumpus it got a very personal attack II

709.14 --> 715.73
as well like they were grilling me at

713.25 --> 719.64
trying to test every bit of me and

715.73 --> 721.89
rumpus asserted that I didn't know

719.64 --> 724.77
anything about gravity and everything so

721.89 --> 728.6999999999999
I was like you know really really no no

724.77 --> 730.89
no ask me anything anything from any

728.7 --> 734.34
angle about gravity I'll know it I'll

730.89 --> 736.68
know it I'll get it right I might not

734.34 --> 740.13
know all the details statistic about

736.68 --> 743.37
some specific okay but I know I know

740.13 --> 747.06
exactly what it is because I believed it

743.37 --> 749.46
I'd have dot Dovan very far so I put it

747.06 --> 751.8
all down and just yeah of course I had

749.46 --> 754.98
no response and pretty much the rest of

751.8 --> 757.89
the room gave me a win so after that I

754.98 --> 760.77
was just rumpus against the room was

757.89 --> 764.72
hilarious and then later Brenda got

760.77 --> 766.92
involved and then I went up to her and

764.72 --> 770.21
eventually because she was just

766.92 --> 773.04
completely blocking on everything

770.21 --> 778.47
started calling her out as a Marxist and

773.04 --> 781.29
a Marxist methodologist and she

778.47 --> 784.74
protested now right nothing you wear

781.29 --> 787.5899999999999
blah blah and now told everyone like

784.74 --> 789.75
yeah people actually know what I mean by

787.59 --> 791.49
that in general that have looked into

789.75 --> 795.89
that are interested and they will

791.49 --> 798.21
recognize what I said is true and yeah

795.89 --> 805.76
nobody had a real refute to that of

798.21 --> 805.76
course but yeah I thought I was pretty

806.41 --> 812.7099999999999
I was very confident about my case and I

810.16 --> 816.1899999999999
am I really know what I know and how

812.71 --> 820.6
much of it also in comparison to the

816.19 --> 824.08
other people that are in front of me all

820.6 --> 827.0500000000001
the ballers I pretty much think I can

824.08 --> 831.1600000000001
properly size up how much they really

827.05 --> 833.1099999999999
know because they do try to brag a lot

831.16 --> 835.12
and yeah when you do that when you

833.11 --> 835.87
constantly try to show off their big

835.12 --> 842.49
skills

835.87 --> 845.41
yeah then give a pretty good read out

842.49 --> 848.32
over the times you can see why the peaks

845.41 --> 854.04
go how high if you have to feel to size

848.32 --> 854.0400000000001
that up and I do very conveniently so

862.36 --> 868.9590000000001
oh yeah Brenda's also masochist yeah

865.059 --> 873.579
that that preceded the Marxist part yeah

868.959 --> 875.559
I don't everybody agreed to that except

873.579 --> 878.439
for her of course and she had to

875.559 --> 881.17
doublethink her way out of that and red

878.439 --> 886.209
herring it hello Joseph

881.17 --> 888.54
369 Missouri bear big chunga's unicorn

886.209 --> 888.54
Slayer

894.71 --> 897.73
so Chico

906.11 --> 910.63
oh you heard it they lie Ohio you were

908.42 --> 910.63
there

915.2 --> 922.6700000000001
yeah well the whole process though you

917.75 --> 924.62
know I was pretty um like on top of the

922.67 --> 926.149
situation but eventually I really did

924.62 --> 931.97
get kind of drained out

926.149 --> 935.329
so then Jose wanted to suggest oh no get

931.97 --> 940.399
Brenda or yeah Brenda rumpus and are we

935.329 --> 942.38
in a room and I was like no I like I

940.399 --> 945.35
like this room because yeah I heard a

942.38 --> 946.97
lot of sensible voice I didn't even know

945.35 --> 950.0600000000001
for sure like if were they Glover's or

946.97 --> 952.19
flat earthers at every corner but I just

950.06 --> 954.1099999999999
heard a lot of sensible responses and I

952.19 --> 957.1990000000001
liked it and I start like nah I like

954.11 --> 960.7090000000001
this room especially just the lady I

957.199 --> 965.18
like carrying ladies doing the right

960.709 --> 970.8389999999999
thing I don't know maybe that's my it's

965.18 --> 970.8389999999999
just I like ladies that talk sense so

971.019 --> 977.2090000000001
probably not at every point in the

973.43 --> 979.3889999999999
entire hangout but yeah you know what I

977.209 --> 979.3889999999999
mean

981.87 --> 985.64
Oh Jennifer Winterburn

997.57 --> 1001.759
yeah twit yeah Twitter would was there I

1000.31 --> 1004.41
[Music]

1001.759 --> 1006.509
although with to it I don't worry I'm

1004.41 --> 1009.029
not really sure like where she stands it

1006.509 --> 1012.019
is she even a flat earther or isn't she

1009.029 --> 1012.019
I'm not sure

1019.06 --> 1023.4
but she's been alone around for a long

1021.34 --> 1023.4
time

1026.8 --> 1029.96
[Music]

1040.02 --> 1042.74
yep

1049.67 --> 1052.78
she's not right

1053.62 --> 1061.2099999999998
okay well that's well yeah well that's

1058.39 --> 1063.96
interesting it's also impressive that

1061.21 --> 1066.52
the ciub all are just genuinely

1063.96 --> 1069.789
respected with feelings and all that's

1066.52 --> 1072.19
to me is pretty impressive you know I

1069.789 --> 1074.71
didn't counter that often among bother

1072.19 --> 1078.69
so most of them have a lot of trouble

1074.71 --> 1078.69
holding back their personal feelings

1092.44 --> 1095.16
right

1096.7 --> 1102.96
I wonder sometimes Nathan it is ah dude

1100.119 --> 1102.9599999999998
don't

1107.26 --> 1109.86
what

1113.37 --> 1116.84
oh that's just great

1119.07 --> 1127.86
thank you I I don't know why but I

1124.12 --> 1127.86
couldn't remove the freaking message

1128.61 --> 1141.79
yeah but thanks for doing that and I you

1134.56 --> 1144.7
know I let even too sure whether I don't

1141.79 --> 1148.6599999999999
know from it's okay it's okay you know

1144.7 --> 1154.21
it's yeah II do but leave that to your

1148.66 --> 1156.8400000000001
show is it true no nathan is it really

1154.21 --> 1160.9
true I don't know I don't know have any

1156.84 --> 1162.6699999999998
background proof that anything of what

1160.9 --> 1164.8300000000002
she says is true you know it could be

1162.67 --> 1167.25
that she's really a woman pretending to

1164.83 --> 1170.9399999999998
be a [ __ ] ever considered that I

1167.25 --> 1173.26
wouldn't put it outside of her reach I

1170.94 --> 1175.75
don't know I don't know at this point

1173.26 --> 1180.91
I've said we've seen this presumed

1175.75 --> 1184.69
photograph kept to ourselves but I don't

1180.91 --> 1186.97
know for sure you know the only way for

1184.69 --> 1190.51
me to be sure is to actually kind of be

1186.97 --> 1196.66
face to face with the person and be

1190.51 --> 1202.89
allowed to kind of check her out and

1196.66 --> 1202.89
Alan and Alice is wise and then yeah

1203.02 --> 1211.36
I could figure out like it's this

1207.21 --> 1217.66
completely natural or not but other than

1211.36 --> 1220.51
that I just no no but that's for

1217.66 --> 1223.23
psychological side yeah that's just it's

1220.51 --> 1223.23
just a nice stuff

1232.44 --> 1235.539
[Music]

1235.65 --> 1238.2800000000002
right

1241.92 --> 1250.0800000000002
look to me I personally I approach the

1245.22 --> 1253.29
whole gender issue and all that it to me

1250.08 --> 1255.3899999999999
in is purely psychological and he yeah

1253.29 --> 1258.03
doesn't mean that I have to say that

1255.39 --> 1260.64
every time in the face of these people

1258.03 --> 1263.09
and emphasize like oh technically I

1260.64 --> 1266.9
could consider you insane or anything

1263.09 --> 1270.1499999999999
because it's no use really doing that

1266.9 --> 1272.3700000000001
you know only if you can get deeper

1270.15 --> 1275.91
sense into the person and get them to be

1272.37 --> 1277.83
willing to try and fix what's keeping

1275.91 --> 1279.8400000000001
them in that mindset or whatever but

1277.83 --> 1282.57
that's so rare you know it doesn't

1279.84 --> 1287.1
happen especially not in more publics

1282.57 --> 1289.2
and areas so it's just like okay it has

1287.1 --> 1292.62
a certain issue if you just use these

1289.2 --> 1294.27
words then yeah you can still attempt to

1292.62 --> 1297.1399999999999
somewhat have a conversation and that's

1294.27 --> 1299.549
what it's about right so that's my

1297.14 --> 1300.929
Universal approach and it doesn't even

1299.549 --> 1304.28
always work because brand not just

1300.929 --> 1307.5
sometimes per default starts attacking

1304.28 --> 1310.1399999999999
opens up attacking everything the de

1307.5 --> 1315.48
Marxist approach the market the Marxist

1310.14 --> 1318.99
entry declare hostility and just start

1315.48 --> 1324.57
attacking even though there's no even no

1318.99 --> 1327.23
real premise it's just all flip flop

1324.57 --> 1327.23
reality

1332.69 --> 1344.97
GCHQ what's that I have suspicions

1341.97 --> 1347.309
Joseph 3 6 9 that this is just pure

1344.97 --> 1350.73
suspicion no lead no direct leads it's

1347.309 --> 1354.809
just methodology and what Brennan seems

1350.73 --> 1356.76
to be doing and no it's just a chance in

1354.809 --> 1359.16
my opinion that could be true that she

1356.76 --> 1363.33
may be contracted with the Southern

1359.16 --> 1366.63
Poverty Law Center for real would be

1363.33 --> 1368.58
totally down a lane that could be a

1366.63 --> 1372.3500000000001
thing other than that I don't know I

1368.58 --> 1375.51
don't even know what GCHQ means really

1372.35 --> 1375.51
[Music]

1379.16 --> 1387.02
though I got questions very bare

1395.55 --> 1405.32
all right well yeah Jeffrey bill but

1399.44 --> 1409.71
isn't that in a way how the system that

1405.32 --> 1414.54
promotes all this gender confusion and

1409.71 --> 1417.63
all that it uses that it's like the

1414.54 --> 1420.06
education and indoctrination mesmerizes

1417.63 --> 1423.17
certain individuals that are yeah become

1420.06 --> 1425.52
subjected to it and can't yet that

1423.17 --> 1426.93
surrender to it as it were or to parts

1425.52 --> 1428.76
of it become obsessed with certain

1426.93 --> 1432.3600000000001
elements then make it part of their

1428.76 --> 1434.1
identity and then that is a certain type

1432.36 --> 1436.6799999999998
of mindset that is in a way very

1434.1 --> 1441.0
predictable it's like even statistical

1436.68 --> 1445.5900000000001
in a way and the system corporations and

1441.0 --> 1448.29
all that they count on that and then

1445.59 --> 1450.54
they have kind of like designations for

1448.29 --> 1456.1499999999999
people with very specific mindsets

1450.54 --> 1461.3999999999999
programs for them and yeah make it very

1456.15 --> 1464.46
appealing to them because it is all

1461.4 --> 1467.16
adapted to their way of thinking things

1464.46 --> 1469.68
it's so tailor-made for them almost

1467.16 --> 1472.5600000000002
miraculously to that maybe was just

1469.68 --> 1473.3700000000001
super convenient so yeah that's kind of

1472.56 --> 1478.3999999999999
how it works

1473.37 --> 1481.02
it mesmerizes individuals and then

1478.4 --> 1484.5800000000002
because of the predictability that comes

1481.02 --> 1488.58
out of the mesmerize ation yeah there is

1484.58 --> 1490.9199999999998
tailor-made routes built for them in

1488.58 --> 1492.6899999999998
order to fulfill very specific functions

1490.92 --> 1495.45
and they will do it probably very

1492.69 --> 1498.06
fanatically because of the convenience

1495.45 --> 1502.94
because it's their lifestyle against the

1498.06 --> 1502.94
world pretty much see how that works

1517.85 --> 1527.1899999999998
it's like a corporate indoctrination

1522.06 --> 1530.55
based reloading mechanism based on

1527.19 --> 1533.5800000000002
cultural influences it's it's kind of

1530.55 --> 1538.1699999999998
sophisticated but it's part of the

1533.58 --> 1542.58
corporate system the machine and it is

1538.17 --> 1546.54
dehumanizing in nature that's what it's

1542.58 --> 1550.35
counts on it's it's like another form of

1546.54 --> 1553.77
slavery except now through cultural

1550.35 --> 1558.1799999999998
indoctrination and those yeah

1553.77 --> 1563.49
vulnerable to it become enslaved that

1558.18 --> 1566.8700000000001
way in a very specific way so it's not

1563.49 --> 1570.8
slavery where clearly you literally

1566.87 --> 1578.1299999999999
can't do things anymore specifically but

1570.8 --> 1581.37
it's just the social order just make it

1578.13 --> 1584.96
different for you it's just like a class

1581.37 --> 1587.1599999999999
system artificially arriving culturally

1584.96 --> 1590.25
because also because of mass

1587.16 --> 1592.8000000000002
communication that makes that a more

1590.25 --> 1595.05
tangible Network where there's just

1592.8 --> 1598.2
where things go quicker and peer

1595.05 --> 1601.98
pressure is more direct more obstructive

1598.2 --> 1604.5900000000001
it peer pressure and bureaucracy is a

1601.98 --> 1607.88
great detriment to the overall speed

1604.59 --> 1612.4099999999999
that arrived with mass communication and

1607.88 --> 1618.0800000000002
that is what it also works on works with

1612.41 --> 1618.0800000000002
its sophisticated anyway

1620.21 --> 1624.259
I hope you could kind of follow what I

1622.669 --> 1626.679
was talking about it it was hard to

1624.259 --> 1626.679
describe

1632.789 --> 1642.48
but I hope you guys get my point of the

1639.909 --> 1642.48
mechanism

1653.93 --> 1657.069
[Music]

1665.42 --> 1671.96
Pro shields have handlers like PS

1676.79 --> 1686.1499999999999
Pro shells well I I think it's a I don't

1682.61 --> 1688.79
think that's like every of these super

1686.15 --> 1691.5500000000002
troll individuals the pro shells

1688.79 --> 1694.01
whatever I don't think they all have

1691.55 --> 1697.82
their own handlers that are like

1694.01 --> 1699.71
specifically an agency or anything I

1697.82 --> 1701.9299999999998
think it's a little bit more

1699.71 --> 1704.8700000000001
sophisticated than that I think there's

1701.93 --> 1711.02
probably some people out there that do

1704.87 --> 1714.34
have direct handlers and but it's gonna

1711.02 --> 1717.05
be very few and the rest is just the

1714.34 --> 1719.06
weird thing is about people especially

1717.05 --> 1722.05
that are really struggling and that are

1719.06 --> 1727.22
trying to develop that are like in this

1722.05 --> 1729.47
in this struggle combat whether it be

1727.22 --> 1733.64
mental or whatever it yet they they kind

1729.47 --> 1738.52
of need people to console with to rely

1733.64 --> 1741.3500000000001
upon and it's like a natural position

1738.52 --> 1743.09
socially that arise for those for every

1741.35 --> 1747.74
individual you need somebody to go with

1743.09 --> 1751.97
like so what yeah to make it a bit

1747.74 --> 1755.29
easier that's what they all need and you

1751.97 --> 1759.56
pick somebody that's just good at it and

1755.29 --> 1763.21
yeah where the agent really comes into

1759.56 --> 1765.62
play is at the top of the entire chain

1763.21 --> 1769.49
because that's just how it naturally

1765.62 --> 1772.6
forms in such communities it's just

1769.49 --> 1772.6
that's how it works

1774.34 --> 1780.8799999999999
so I don't think that every one of these

1777.57 --> 1782.5
ballers has their own personal agent and

1780.88 --> 1784.96
that there is shield that way no it's

1782.5 --> 1788.76
just a natural social formation and

1784.96 --> 1792.45
there probably is an agent somewhere

1788.76 --> 1796.27
maybe it's even maybe there is just like

1792.45 --> 1798.07
agent source and I don't know I don't

1796.27 --> 1803.62
exactly know what it's out there it's

1798.07 --> 1806.86
never got that far but I think that is

1803.62 --> 1816.7299999999998
the more logical way to presume things

1806.86 --> 1819.6399999999999
are set up and who knows in a way I ya

1816.73 --> 1821.74
don't want to don't want to go in

1819.64 --> 1824.38
friendly-fire here and I'm just

1821.74 --> 1827.05
definitely not going to be specific but

1824.38 --> 1828.91
yeah there may it may be kind of the

1827.05 --> 1830.86
same way in the flat earth and there was

1828.91 --> 1832.98
always so much accusations of very

1830.86 --> 1837.9699999999998
shields and somebody has a handler and

1832.98 --> 1846.06
you know but there may be some out there

1837.97 --> 1846.06
that in a way do have handlers but

1847.08 --> 1853.1789999999999
for us in a way it's not even relevant

1851.049 --> 1856.15
unless there is a specific type of

1853.179 --> 1858.67
gatekeeping going on very tellingly and

1856.15 --> 1863.95
then you can eventually sort of pinpoint

1858.67 --> 1869.89
sources roughly and but it's not even

1863.95 --> 1872.559
that relevant because for them it's

1869.89 --> 1876.22
probably just like oh I got an extra

1872.559 --> 1880.36
source and well that source could then

1876.22 --> 1883.0
see them as an opportunity to import

1880.36 --> 1885.8799999999999
certain data or to like recommend you

1883.0 --> 1888.61
got to do it like this so it is more

1885.88 --> 1894.0400000000002
like a trade-off situation I'd imagine

1888.61 --> 1897.6399999999999
with letters it's not really the same

1894.04 --> 1902.02
kind of thing although yeah they weighed

1897.64 --> 1904.2990000000002
it there could be this thing and I even

1902.02 --> 1907.21
talked about this pretty early on even

1904.299 --> 1911.71
in the flatter talks that potentially

1907.21 --> 1915.64
deef the disk that ohm there's no globe

1911.71 --> 1917.95
earth could be a a project specifically

1915.64 --> 1924.8090000000002
being forwarded from agency as the

1917.95 --> 1928.24
alternative for probably adaptation

1924.809 --> 1932.1689999999999
purposes because hey it is kind of

1928.24 --> 1935.23
tangible it could potentially over time

1932.169 --> 1938.0200000000002
or maybe even relatively quickly be

1935.23 --> 1941.049
adopted by a wider public without

1938.02 --> 1944.62
shoving super complicated stuff about

1941.049 --> 1948.52
the actual real thing in their face so

1944.62 --> 1952.3899999999999
maybe that is an agent forwarding but

1948.52 --> 1954.28
it's not nefarious it's more like social

1952.39 --> 1957.63
engineering is like trying to stabilize

1954.28 --> 1959.9189999999999
the change or something that could be no

1957.63 --> 1964.98
direct evidence of it but it has been

1959.919 --> 1964.98
sort of fake suspicions

1965.58 --> 1970.1789999999999
because that thing is so predominant but

1968.59 --> 1972.4599999999998
on the other hand it could also be

1970.179 --> 1975.6100000000001
considered well it is so predominant

1972.46 --> 1977.7
because it works and we go with what

1975.61 --> 1981.34
works a lot of flat earthers are just

1977.7 --> 1984.159
going with what works to them so it

1981.34 --> 1986.23
could also be purely a natural phenomena

1984.159 --> 1989.0800000000002
or maybe it was a natural phenomenon

1986.23 --> 1992.5
that originally had a bit of a nudge to

1989.08 --> 1996.1299999999999
get it in early that could be an agent

1992.5 --> 1998.71
move in a way see it so it's all this

1996.13 --> 2001.0700000000002
stuff that agents do is in reality much

1998.71 --> 2005.3990000000001
more subtle

2001.07 --> 2007.769
then we've come to imagine typically

2005.399 --> 2013.399
also thanks to movie culture making it

2007.769 --> 2013.3990000000001
all action and [ __ ] and much more tense

2013.519 --> 2019.19
so alright that's my thoughts about that

2016.769 --> 2019.19
anyway

2019.36 --> 2022.54
[Music]

2026.8 --> 2030.25
[Music]

2038.789 --> 2049.459
I got questions Noah to be fair I don't

2042.419 --> 2049.4590000000003
know any real touch Flat Earth channels

2051.649 --> 2056.73
or at least channels that are like

2054.509 --> 2061.079
really on a regular basis doing

2056.73 --> 2063.389
something there are people out there

2061.079 --> 2070.049
Dutch people that have some flatter

2063.389 --> 2074.309
videos here and there but no I haven't

2070.049 --> 2081.96
come across them so far that are like

2074.309 --> 2083.6690000000003
really active who knows maybe they are

2081.96 --> 2086.309
out there maybe the algorithm is

2083.669 --> 2089.609
separating us I don't know maybe I'll

2086.309 --> 2092.909
bump to the into them one day I've met a

2089.609 --> 2097.619
few Dutch flat-earthers that I know are

2092.909 --> 2099.509
active and I know there is just there's

2097.619 --> 2101.059
a lot of flat earthers in the

2099.509 --> 2104.059
Netherlands out there that are very

2101.059 --> 2104.059
interested

2121.54 --> 2127.54
yeah Joseph 3 6 9 I don't really deal

2125.0 --> 2127.54
with Twitter

2131.76 --> 2136.13
I kind of leave that out to other people

2147.47 --> 2155.0299999999997
mmm-hmm I just what big chunga's I think

2152.81 --> 2159.5
you're misinterpreting Missouri's back

2155.03 --> 2161.63
were Missouri bears use of the word

2159.5 --> 2164.39
conspiracy I think she was being literal

2161.63 --> 2167.06
and not shortening it for conspiracy

2164.39 --> 2171.589
theory the modernized cultural

2167.06 --> 2176.2
terminology for wide variety of thinking

2171.589 --> 2176.2
directions now she's technically correct

2177.099 --> 2183.8590000000004
conspiracy it's the people getting

2179.27 --> 2190.13
together planning out things yeah it's

2183.859 --> 2193.19
everywhere a lot of things that have

2190.13 --> 2202.7000000000003
arrived rich me are founded on

2193.19 --> 2205.88
conspiracy most big ideas don't get

2202.7 --> 2206.569
really built out in the open from

2205.88 --> 2210.8
scratch

2206.569 --> 2214.63
it started out secret isn't that

2210.8 --> 2214.63
conspiring in a way

2236.11 --> 2240.81
did I get that right by the way Missouri

2238.48 --> 2240.81
Bear

2255.19 --> 2261.63
hmm let jungus has suddenly grown very

2258.97 --> 2261.6299999999997
silent

2320.85 --> 2323.54
hmm

2332.93 --> 2342.71
oh yeah yeah I know yeah I know that's

2339.35 --> 2346.21
what you men just clarifying what misery

2342.71 --> 2346.21
bear was talking about

2353.55 --> 2362.1000000000004
yeah yeah hey I am well aware that a lot

2357.85 --> 2365.7999999999997
of people just like to think up stuff

2362.1 --> 2375.2799999999997
ideas concepts so yeah conspiracy

2365.8 --> 2377.05
theories it is no I think conspiracy

2375.28 --> 2379.8100000000004
theories have been around for a long

2377.05 --> 2383.05
time it's like the cafe talk of certain

2379.81 --> 2386.82
type of people back then was different

2383.05 --> 2386.82
but there's just been so much

2386.97 --> 2392.89
communication and things have changed

2389.11 --> 2395.08
this the rough setting of how people

2392.89 --> 2396.73
overall spend their time throughout the

2395.08 --> 2401.0499999999997
day that

2396.73 --> 2404.26
yeah conspiracy theory has become a good

2401.05 --> 2411.9100000000003
way to keep developing your mind and

2404.26 --> 2414.61
senses and test things so conspiracy

2411.91 --> 2416.62
theories are very interesting for for

2414.61 --> 2418.54
critical thinkers because every

2416.62 --> 2420.19
conspiracy theory is a bit of a puzzle

2418.54 --> 2424.33
and you can just see the strengths and

2420.19 --> 2429.34
weaknesses eventually size it up like

2424.33 --> 2433.9
how much reality is there to this it's

2429.34 --> 2438.2400000000002
what I do is but yeah a lot of it is

2433.9 --> 2439.51
also nonsense out there or overblown or

2438.24 --> 2447.4599999999996
yeah

2439.51 --> 2453.2700000000004
I top fear porn but that doesn't mean

2447.46 --> 2455.23
that there is absolutely nothing to it

2453.27 --> 2457.72
whatever it's going to be there may be

2455.23 --> 2459.69
something to it could just be taken out

2457.72 --> 2464.0099999999998
of context overblown it's up to the

2459.69 --> 2464.01
interested person to figure that out

2476.79 --> 2485.42
all right yeah there's a lot of interest

2480.96 --> 2488.85
in flutters I know dairy how daft hairy

2485.42 --> 2490.7400000000002
and yeah there's a lot of flat earthers

2488.85 --> 2493.0099999999998
and people that spend quite a lot of

2490.74 --> 2497.81
time and energy and even money on it

2493.01 --> 2500.76
because well not because their research

2497.81 --> 2503.0099999999998
showed them that it was actually a

2500.76 --> 2506.4300000000003
nonsense conspiracy but that is actually

2503.01 --> 2509.1000000000004
a lot to it that's why there is now so

2506.43 --> 2512.19
many flat earthers taft Harry

2509.1 --> 2512.19
[Music]

2533.13 --> 2540.78
No all right I'm sorry to respond to

2537.57 --> 2543.0
that big chunga's would be an odd place

2540.78 --> 2544.86
to use the word conspiracy if I plan

2543.0 --> 2546.51
something with friends we just planned

2544.86 --> 2548.7000000000003
to do something wouldn't call it

2546.51 --> 2550.5
conspiring to do something well that all

2548.7 --> 2553.1699999999996
depends are are there going to be

2550.5 --> 2555.63
parties that are not going to be happy

2553.17 --> 2557.52
with what you're doing you know it

2555.63 --> 2561.3
doesn't have to be illegal or anything

2557.52 --> 2564.81
but just you know that's what I

2561.3 --> 2567.59
emphasize if you do it in secret because

2564.81 --> 2570.06
not everybody's gonna be happy about it

2567.59 --> 2572.61
meaning not in the open yeah that's

2570.06 --> 2576.39
conspiracy that is conspiring it's

2572.61 --> 2579.09
exactly what it is but if you're gonna

2576.39 --> 2581.79
leave all of that out then you're it's

2579.09 --> 2585.98
just learning something but yeah there's

2581.79 --> 2585.98
no context to that it's not specific

2586.51 --> 2598.4700000000003
[Music]

2588.94 --> 2598.4700000000003
yes no no a gym don't go there man

2639.45 --> 2642.049
what

2649.23 --> 2657.84
hmm hmm yeah is this very smart of you

2654.96 --> 2660.6
there big chunga's yeah the the phrase

2657.84 --> 2661.46
conspiracy theory did exist before the

2660.6 --> 2667.5
CA

2661.46 --> 2674.19
however the CIA started to introduce and

2667.5 --> 2677.22
basically apply it to media they took it

2674.19 --> 2681.87
out of just general talk and description

2677.22 --> 2685.22
and kind of weaponized it so maybe you

2681.87 --> 2685.22
missed the point about that

2691.1 --> 2694.199
[Music]

2696.43 --> 2700.47
what are you talking about hm

2707.21 --> 2712.39
yeah weaponized it specifically

2732.18 --> 2735.2999999999997
[Music]

2753.54 --> 2756.44
mm-hmm

2772.08 --> 2781.89
while george sanford i really how well

2776.97 --> 2784.74
do you know him another thing i've seen

2781.89 --> 2789.42
from him is just some activity in my

2784.74 --> 2792.3199999999997
chat in the last few weeks do you really

2789.42 --> 2792.32
know him that well

2800.49 --> 2803.5899999999997
[Music]

2807.84 --> 2810.8790000000004
[Music]

2823.21 --> 2830.04
yeah Jared Sanford but I don't know I

2826.41 --> 2830.04
heard worse you know

2859.06 --> 2862.47
what an argument

2862.88 --> 2868.79
presupposition to dismiss

2893.89 --> 2898.81
yeah sorry I'm getting them just to

2897.1 --> 2901.5099999999998
distract you know I'm a little bit slow

2898.81 --> 2907.6
and maybe it because of what super late

2901.51 --> 2910.17
last night I do feel kind of rested

2907.6 --> 2910.17
though but just

2914.26 --> 2918.9700000000003
getting some crisps recess to this

2916.599 --> 2921.04
probably do some good it's a physical

2918.97 --> 2925.2599999999998
workout usually wakes me up I haven't

2921.04 --> 2925.2599999999998
gotten to that for the show

2934.69 --> 2944.73
oh really big jungus are you serious are

2939.52 --> 2947.86
you serious I just described verbally

2944.73 --> 2951.75
like a few minutes five minutes ago or

2947.86 --> 2955.6200000000003
something or more exactly what they did

2951.75 --> 2959.32
how they weaponized the terminology

2955.62 --> 2963.87
using it in media and and the government

2959.32 --> 2968.29
they would use it as a like yeah a

2963.87 --> 2971.74
political opponent like the witch some

2968.29 --> 2977.5299999999997
kind of negative designation a shaming

2971.74 --> 2982.62
designation that's what the CIA did with

2977.53 --> 2989.01
that and it's naturally developed and

2982.62 --> 2989.0099999999998
yeah had its own influences since then

3000.48 --> 3007.7
I don't understand why you claim that

3002.579 --> 3011.27
nobody has expanded beyond 1967 that's

3007.7 --> 3011.27
can't be serious

3013.03 --> 3016.079
[Music]

3017.83 --> 3022.6
well that's that's what you said right

3020.08 --> 3029.44
that's when they popularized it that's

3022.6 --> 3032.86
when it became introduced well now it's

3029.44 --> 3035.23
a widely familiar word and it has all

3032.86 --> 3039.82
kinds of feelings indoctrinated attached

3035.23 --> 3043.84
with it because of the media output so

3039.82 --> 3048.01
it's been weaponized so opinionated it

3043.84 --> 3051.04
and that indoctrination effect prevents

3048.01 --> 3053.05
people from looking into them that's

3051.04 --> 3055.71
exactly what the weaponization was

3053.05 --> 3055.71
designed for

3059.6 --> 3062.69
[Music]

3065.17 --> 3068.369
[Music]

3092.92 --> 3096.78
so anything else big chunga's

3103.16 --> 3106.31
[Music]

3132.0 --> 3134.75
meaning

3140.299 --> 3147.329
depends on what context you're asking

3143.01 --> 3150.289
that question it's a widely interpreted

3147.329 --> 3150.289
sentence

3190.27 --> 3195.97
yeah I think a big chunk is kind of ran

3193.19 --> 3195.9700000000003
out of a point

3216.01 --> 3219.059
[Music]

3249.5 --> 3256.82
god sick this is not really going

3254.01 --> 3256.82
anywhere guys

3264.43 --> 3272.7599999999998
really sorry [ __ ] no

3294.6 --> 3300.68

3297.42 --> 3306.0
show it's not gonna be a long one today

3389.079 --> 3393.42

3393.42 --> 3403.81
financial situation that changed that
