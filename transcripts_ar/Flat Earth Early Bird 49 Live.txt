4.04 --> 12.3
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.04 --> 17.13
early-bird number 49 I'm your host

12.3 --> 23.55
Arwen and yeah it's a cold day outside

17.13 --> 28.669999999999998
and Misty show you that's not really

23.55 --> 28.67
misty but it's just watch our calls

29.14 --> 31.95
it's not that

37.32 --> 50.85
yeah man I am so glad that I'm

45.06 --> 55.92
vegetarian because yeah yesterday was

50.85 --> 61.05
pretty heavy day for me he I really felt

55.92 --> 63.5
that that big Christmas dinner was in my

61.05 --> 63.5
system

64.409 --> 71.61
give too much trouble but yet today it

67.49 --> 77.369
seems to be fully out now and I feel

71.61 --> 81.75
just an extra layer of energy on top of

77.369 --> 83.52
what what I did yesterday and yeah I

81.75 --> 84.63
didn't even notice that slipped away

83.52 --> 90.81
basically

84.63 --> 93.479
so yeah vegetarian definitely is my my

90.81 --> 96.409
way to go so yeah there's a lot of

93.479 --> 96.409
activity in chat

99.72 --> 108.46
long conversation with John Watson woz

106.03 --> 109.15
was in chats sure but naughty and this

108.46 --> 114.72
is hilarious

109.15 --> 114.72
if I scroll and chat you see it as well

116.18 --> 127.51
right

118.15 --> 130.93
so Ezra is in chat and David read Dan

127.51 --> 136.39000000000001
Winfield simulation dweller Stewart

130.93 --> 141.37
Melville flat earth oh yeah my fell my

136.39 --> 142.67999999999998
volume yeah there's nothing I can really

141.37 --> 147.84
do about it

142.68 --> 147.84
because it seems to be at max here

152.819 --> 156.439
let's see if I can do

166.87 --> 172.159
No

169.37 --> 174.53
I don't know how to change it yeah I

172.159 --> 176.569
find my volume a bit low as well it's

174.53 --> 182.62
kind of annoying now I've managed to

176.569 --> 185.08999999999997
compensate the panel because they're not

182.62 --> 187.61
yeah there's not as low for you but I

185.09 --> 192.769
don't know how to announce my own

187.61 --> 202.19000000000003
I'm trying stuff right now advanced

192.769 --> 205.519
audio options oh wait yeah I can up my

202.19 --> 211.93
volume that's good okay I'm gonna up at

205.519 --> 211.93
20% see it's that better

213.069 --> 216.17999999999998
how's it now

218.27 --> 222.82000000000002
is this a batter volume guys

224.05 --> 228.09
all right so this is 20% louder

229.77 --> 237.29000000000002
I could up it even a little little bit

233.19 --> 237.29
more let's see

237.47 --> 245.44
okay I'll put it to 130 percent

243.24 --> 249.46
right

245.44 --> 252.96
sing a song that's a good one just be

249.46 --> 258.67
really loud well I'm already seeing the

252.96 --> 262.27
the audio output go into the yellow when

258.67 --> 265.3
I am a little bit louder but it seems to

262.27 --> 269.08
be resting well in the midpoint of the

265.3 --> 273.43
green part so it does look like it's

269.08 --> 277.99
louder but no I'm not gonna up it more

273.43 --> 282.43
for now yeah guys the link I'm not

277.99 --> 286.75
putting it in public just yet but was I

282.43 --> 294.48
got you on skype so I will pass it on

286.75 --> 294.48
the Skype people who are in Skype

299.78 --> 303.52
so yeah you know what to do

309.08 --> 312.52
it was you got the link

313.05 --> 318.59000000000003
a background hiss is that so

328.54 --> 331.17
right

354.25 --> 359.14
I can see it there it does seem to be

357.13 --> 361.59
some kind of a background sound that's

359.14 --> 361.59
really odd

380.95 --> 386.62
you know what a hundred percent volume

383.53 --> 392.85999999999996
is not even that maybe it's because my

386.62 --> 396.0
mic I don't know what this is put it

392.86 --> 396.0
back to 130 percent

397.15 --> 402.71999999999997
I think the noise is just because of my

400.45 --> 402.71999999999997
mic

405.3 --> 412.28000000000003
hey Jose Erica Shane Tony V

424.3 --> 430.11
so was if you want to join I sent you

427.12 --> 430.11
the link inside

454.01 --> 461.28999999999996
you start what

457.22 --> 461.29
oh dear oh dear I hear

467.66 --> 474.23
I can't help you in that case because

472.04 --> 477.47
somebody will have to join through that

474.23 --> 480.14000000000004
link and then they might be able to add

477.47 --> 485.18
you in the back chat they know how to do

480.14 --> 487.55
that but yeah I I can't get in there

485.18 --> 493.61
that's the problem of the setup it's the

487.55 --> 495.2
same problem Nathan has so right or you

493.61 --> 498.5
have to get on your all of that though

495.2 --> 501.05
oh yeah by the way yeah yeah indeed

498.5 --> 503.75
simulation dweller yeah Randy helped me

501.05 --> 509.26
out yesterday he was advertising like a

503.75 --> 514.099
madman was kind of weird seeing that I I

509.26 --> 517.52
tend to not do that I'm too shy to be

514.099 --> 520.5200000000001
that advertising for myself but yeah he

517.52 --> 522.6999999999999
put on some real effort and I got a lot

520.52 --> 525.11
of subscribers especially yesterday at

522.7 --> 528.22
Martin Lita's hangout which was very

525.11 --> 528.22
interesting anyway

530.93 --> 536.53
but yeah I have suddenly I am at

539.85 --> 545.86
850 subscribers so thank you everyone

542.95 --> 550.9300000000001
who subscribed and yeah welcome to the

545.86 --> 559.39
flatter the early bird show and I hope I

550.93 --> 563.89
will entertain though huh okay Jose says

559.39 --> 566.8
he advertised on Facebook as well people

563.89 --> 570.39
from Facebook are also welcome I don't

566.8 --> 570.39
use Facebook myself

574.57 --> 579.85
but yeah everybody on any social media

577.57 --> 583.47
is welcome so if you know anyone that

579.85 --> 588.19
might be interested then share the show

583.47 --> 590.71
and help me to get those thousand

588.19 --> 591.82
subscribers because that it has been my

590.71 --> 597.57
goal for a while

591.82 --> 600.62
and yeah I might get there this keeps up

597.57 --> 611.3100000000001
dance now

600.62 --> 613.94
not today Jose right so yeah I could

611.31 --> 618.2399999999999
talk about all kinds of subjects I also

613.94 --> 624.6
enriched the description block of box of

618.24 --> 628.98
the hangout recommendation also of Randi

624.6 --> 630.95
he gave me a lot of tips not kind of

628.98 --> 634.73
used to doing these kind of things but

630.95 --> 637.47
yeah I guess it does help for search

634.73 --> 640.53
results and all these things so I have

637.47 --> 644.6700000000001
done that and we'll see where it goes if

640.53 --> 649.25
that actually makes a difference I'm

644.67 --> 653.4
also considering doing a patreon but

649.25 --> 656.37
yeah randy says he does it and works out

653.4 --> 658.5
very well and it's pretty much yeah you

656.37 --> 662.16
you don't that yeah it all depends on

658.5 --> 665.61
the demands you give or if you give any

662.16 --> 669.27
demands I don't know but I'm yeah I may

665.61 --> 672.2
try it look if it helps it helps and I

669.27 --> 674.79
can keep on doing this and yeah

672.2 --> 678.99
eventually get equipment as I planned

674.79 --> 681.26
and go places get some footage observe

678.99 --> 681.26
the

681.64 --> 688.66
the horizon and the Mirage in effects

684.7 --> 693.36
the optical slant see if I can prove it

688.66 --> 697.06
eventually I might even use drones to

693.36 --> 701.91
size that up for myself with my own

697.06 --> 701.91
footage so there's no copyright issues

702.66 --> 712.02
and yeah get to see some of the islands

707.04 --> 714.81
in the Netherlands and maybe

712.02 --> 717.72
who knows maybe I could even see a piece

714.81 --> 720.8789999999999
of England from the south of the

717.72 --> 723.339
Netherlands who knows

720.879 --> 725.559
would be interesting and yeah anyway

723.339 --> 728.139
yeah I've had a lot of plans for a long

725.559 --> 734.41
time and that will all help me in that

728.139 --> 742.6
direction because just when it comes to

734.41 --> 745.019
regular jobs time based jobs that's I'm

742.6 --> 748.269
still working on it

745.019 --> 750.579
yeah I am cooperating in trying to find

748.269 --> 757.809
something that could fit somebody like

750.579 --> 760.3889999999999
me with my talents and my how the

757.809 --> 762.309
society calls it social in flexibilities

760.389 --> 766.869
although they're not as bad as they used

762.309 --> 769.449
to be yeah it's kind of a chore to find

766.869 --> 772.0590000000001
something that can fit that makes sense

769.449 --> 777.7289999999999
that I can grow in and apply my skills

772.059 --> 780.4889999999999
properly oh we're working on on it and I

777.729 --> 783.729
will let my myself be surprised what

780.489 --> 787.989
what they come up with and if it's just

783.729 --> 790.979
a crappy option I told them then yeah

787.989 --> 795.129
it's not gonna work out I don't need

790.979 --> 797.1690000000001
like they even offered it like oh yeah

795.129 --> 799.119
if you're like depressed or if you're

797.169 --> 801.399
like you have nothing to do we have like

799.119 --> 802.479
workshops where you can work with stuff

801.399 --> 806.589
goody

802.479 --> 808.749
well I don't have time to waste

806.589 --> 813.1890000000001
basically in that sense I don't need a

808.749 --> 815.7090000000001
hobby you know I need some kind of

813.189 --> 819.789
sensible career path that can help me

815.709 --> 821.799
along the way and yeah if it's not gonna

819.789 --> 825.779
come through the job angle it's gonna

821.799 --> 828.699
come through the social media angle and

825.779 --> 833.709
however that builds up in combination

828.699 --> 838.5999999999999
with my own financial resources I I hope

833.709 --> 842.9789999999999
to be starting companies or like going

838.6 --> 846.12
into logistics in a sense I was thinking

842.979 --> 850.529
about warehouses and housing

846.12 --> 853.41
I don't know having products good

850.529 --> 858.779
products I don't know maybe it's just my

853.41 --> 861.66
hoarding instincts or something I just

858.779 --> 863.67
like having piles of good stuff and a

861.66 --> 866.01
warehouse can definitely accomplish that

863.67 --> 869.52
maybe I'll have like a webshop or

866.01 --> 872.1
something with supplements yeah that's

869.52 --> 874.38
been an idea for a long time it's not

872.1 --> 876.75
super or rich you know I know but yeah

874.38 --> 879.18
it is something I am really interested

876.75 --> 884.01
in personally and I have looked into a

879.18 --> 886.4399999999999
little so yeah but that vault takes some

884.01 --> 888.9
serious finances so it's not something I

886.44 --> 891.12
expect to be like doing out of nowhere

888.9 --> 894.5699999999999
I'm not gonna get a loan with a bank if

891.12 --> 897.8
you know what I mean especially since I

894.57 --> 902.1
have no credentials that they care about

897.8 --> 906.4399999999999
so I'll have to do it on my own or with

902.1 --> 906.44
the help of my friends and family

908.33 --> 914.47
so we'll see where it goes and for now

911.12 --> 917.75
the early bird show will be every day

914.47 --> 920.03
and I will also talk about Flat Earth

917.75 --> 922.85
and I will talk about alternative

920.03 --> 925.31
history and everything that comes with

922.85 --> 928.0400000000001
it and politics if the subject comes up

925.31 --> 930.3399999999999
there's something important need to

928.04 --> 930.3399999999999
share

932.829 --> 939.6289999999999
it's also been a couple of disasters

935.11 --> 945.91
happening again Indonesia is pretty

939.629 --> 950.499
terrible to have that although yeah they

945.91 --> 953.35
do have floods a lot like that tsunamis

950.499 --> 956.529
are not uncommon but yeah it's terrible

953.35 --> 961.379
every time you get to see that stuff so

956.529 --> 968.29
yeah a prayer would be nice at least and

961.379 --> 970.799
of course there's a lot of say Rescue

968.29 --> 973.5999999999999
Foundation kind of thing going on and

970.799 --> 977.17
yeah we're gonna have to see afterward

973.6 --> 978.759
what's gonna actually have happened what

977.17 --> 982.7489999999999
they're gonna do with that money and if

978.759 --> 985.839
it's oh yeah nothing's gonna be shoveled

982.749 --> 989.47
away or put to some other kind of secret

985.839 --> 992.2790000000001
stuff some kind of plans but yeah maybe

989.47 --> 999.339
not hey come join my guest

992.279 --> 1000.319
it was look yeah you got any dude hey

999.339 --> 1002.5490000000001
thanks for coming all right

1000.319 --> 1007.519
all right so just gotta meet my other

1002.549 --> 1010.519
page here now you're coming through

1007.519 --> 1010.519
clear

1010.68 --> 1016.0089999999999
so are you right yeah I up my volume a

1014.699 --> 1020.91
bit

1016.009 --> 1023.569
sorry process but I think that my mic is

1020.91 --> 1028.079
picking up the noise it is like a very

1023.569 --> 1029.6399999999999
it's a detail mic well when I was

1028.079 --> 1031.589
listening to you give a little

1029.64 --> 1033.0590000000002
background piece but now that I've

1031.589 --> 1041.6989999999998
joined that he's has gone away

1033.059 --> 1044.399
hmm all right well maybe it's the a the

1041.699 --> 1048.0890000000002
processor in OBS that's enough that's

1044.399 --> 1050.82
just a little primitive so yeah I am

1048.089 --> 1054.45
also considering like Nathan to use

1050.82 --> 1058.5
audio banana I think it was called to

1054.45 --> 1060.8700000000001
have a proper sound control system that

1058.5 --> 1063.0
way I could probably mute people a lot

1060.87 --> 1065.309
easier because I I tried that kind of

1063.0 --> 1068.88
stuff I think completely failed the

1065.309 --> 1071.809
other day with P Mars because I I'm not

1068.88 --> 1071.8090000000002
too sure what I'm doing

1072.44 --> 1080.51
but I will work on it as and as well as

1077.12 --> 1084.53
the intro still still hoping to get

1080.51 --> 1088.8799999999999
somebody for my intro who can make a

1084.53 --> 1092.33
good animation so yeah that's a I'm

1088.88 --> 1093.14
sorry hmm I'm not I'm not talented no

1092.33 --> 1094.85
that's okay

1093.14 --> 1096.8600000000001
but there's a lot of people out there

1094.85 --> 1099.31
and I hope that just one will contact me

1096.86 --> 1108.6799999999998
what are you what are your other hobbies

1099.31 --> 1113.4199999999998
my other hobbies yeah maybe you can

1108.68 --> 1117.14
fashion a animation to suit one of your

1113.42 --> 1120.89
other favorite hobbies well I have

1117.14 --> 1127.4
dabbled in like 3d animation and little

1120.89 --> 1129.8600000000001
in the 90s of my Amiga 1200 used imagine

1127.4 --> 1131.96
3d and that was really fascinating to do

1129.86 --> 1135.4099999999999
there was an actual raytrace program and

1131.96 --> 1138.71
making proper pictures could take hours

1135.41 --> 1141.0500000000002
sometimes days it was pretty crazy but

1138.71 --> 1145.4
very fascinating to do was like the

1141.05 --> 1148.04
first real 3d imaging that wasn't a

1145.4 --> 1151.1000000000001
lower frame but this technology has

1148.04 --> 1153.94
become since today yeah yeah but yeah

1151.1 --> 1158.6
since then no I've just stepped away

1153.94 --> 1161.5
because the programs there were just too

1158.6 --> 1164.3
many programs and I would see like

1161.5 --> 1166.64
computer people that are really good at

1164.3 --> 1167.99
it just migrated from one program to

1166.64 --> 1170.3300000000002
another just getting to know them

1167.99 --> 1172.58
getting to know them and the getting to

1170.33 --> 1177.1699999999998
know part is the part that I'm actually

1172.58 --> 1179.51
not good at it's part so I got stuck and

1177.17 --> 1181.7
I'm just I stuck to drawing I stuck to

1179.51 --> 1185.15
sketching that's what I've been doing

1181.7 --> 1187.28
all my life and if I really put effort

1185.15 --> 1192.76
into it I can make something really good

1187.28 --> 1192.76
so you pretty could get the pencil right

1193.11 --> 1202.1899999999998
and a lot of practice yeah several art

1198.69 --> 1205.8890000000001
school and even that goldsmithing I had

1202.19 --> 1209.3890000000001
yeah teachings about that

1205.889 --> 1211.4699999999998
so yeah model drawing 3d drawings

1209.389 --> 1213.09
landscape drawings is one of my

1211.47 --> 1216.72
favorites to do I've never been good at

1213.09 --> 1218.4889999999998
drawing people what about games what

1216.72 --> 1224.1000000000001
games the sport what about games and

1218.489 --> 1225.659
sports and that sort of thing oh yeah I

1224.1 --> 1229.7099999999998
thought they were like drawing games

1225.659 --> 1233.3990000000001
since we're not no you're right

1229.71 --> 1236.3400000000001
no games and sports yeah games man well

1233.399 --> 1239.639
one sports concerns no I used to do

1236.34 --> 1242.22
horseback riding pretty seriously

1239.639 --> 1248.309
but yeah into my teens and then I quit

1242.22 --> 1252.8990000000001
it was very expensive yeah it is really

1248.309 --> 1254.759
expensive and you get so balls no no I

1252.899 --> 1259.32
knew how to do it properly

1254.759 --> 1265.259
I did build a lot of famous you know you

1259.32 --> 1267.239
didn't get Mike on digit so Bulls okay I

1265.259 --> 1274.169
didn't start this flatter through those

1267.239 --> 1276.769
angle there no no I never I think I had

1274.169 --> 1280.71
my balls crushed maybe once by accident

1276.769 --> 1283.169
it happens on horseback ride if you have

1280.71 --> 1286.95
careful and if they crushed ever seen

1283.169 --> 1290.0700000000002
spot Estanza no no no no no I was still

1286.95 --> 1296.93
very young so I did horseback riding

1290.07 --> 1301.9099999999999
between my eight and my 17th

1296.93 --> 1304.1000000000001
so no and that was very good at it after

1301.91 --> 1306.41
I was grading right after why I was 12 I

1304.1 --> 1309.6699999999998
did comm tests and everything like

1306.41 --> 1313.7
jumping contest I did wild forest rides

1309.67 --> 1319.16
so yeah I had some amazing experiences

1313.7 --> 1321.44
with that it's yeah really awesome and

1319.16 --> 1323.63
also one of the few places where I

1321.44 --> 1326.66
actually felt socially accepted by

1323.63 --> 1329.15
people because they expected you to have

1326.66 --> 1331.1200000000001
balls and have courage and that was

1329.15 --> 1333.8600000000001
something that I was dealing with a lot

1331.12 --> 1335.87
for myself I love these issues oh so it

1333.86 --> 1337.55
was a good challenge for me and I really

1335.87 --> 1341.6499999999999
grabbed on and latched on to it

1337.55 --> 1346.04
have you always felt an outcast oh yeah

1341.65 --> 1349.52
especially at school but yeah sports

1346.04 --> 1351.71
that and I basically transitioned into

1349.52 --> 1356.54
Taekwondo I started that when I was 12

1351.71 --> 1358.67
and I went very far with that in the

1356.54 --> 1361.79
sense that I approached it in a

1358.67 --> 1365.3200000000002
spiritual way I mastered my balance I

1361.79 --> 1369.6499999999999
mastered my quickness I mastered my

1365.32 --> 1373.97
quick energy management and I've learned

1369.65 --> 1376.25
to do incredible moves very quickly but

1373.97 --> 1378.29
the problem is because of my build and I

1376.25 --> 1381.59
inherited this from my father I tend to

1378.29 --> 1387.62
become really stiff but since I'm now on

1381.59 --> 1389.98
these supplements especially coming

1387.62 --> 1393.309
I said what's

1389.98 --> 1396.46
tumeric yeah the to memory yeah right

1393.309 --> 1400.809
that stuff it helps a lot with

1396.46 --> 1402.94
flexibility and and joints so I have

1400.809 --> 1405.04
some of that strength back that I would

1402.94 --> 1409.059
normally require a regular stretching

1405.04 --> 1411.1299999999999
training and yeah if I would actually do

1409.059 --> 1413.23
will I get into the sports again I would

1411.13 --> 1415.0490000000002
probably be really good at it with now

1413.23 --> 1418.27
these supplements that I didn't have

1415.049 --> 1423.04
back then and a lot more certainty about

1418.27 --> 1425.559
myself and what I can do so yeah I I've

1423.04 --> 1427.99
had some sports and I really use them

1425.559 --> 1436.26
you think you could handle yourself in a

1427.99 --> 1441.88
cart well I'm not gonna say no to that

1436.26 --> 1445.99
but I do know my limits I'm not a big

1441.88 --> 1449.23
guy so yeah I have to be realistic

1445.99 --> 1451.99
and know that I'm not gonna win a boxing

1449.23 --> 1456.809
match on average unless I manage to

1451.99 --> 1459.309
evade most of the blows because I yeah I

1456.809 --> 1461.47
don't like to call it but I am

1459.309 --> 1466.87
relatively fragile because of my size

1461.47 --> 1470.08
and I regenerate quickly so I don't get

1466.87 --> 1473.559
really damaged really quickly but I am

1470.08 --> 1475.75
yeah if only so much mass so if I could

1473.559 --> 1476.86
get York tout a lot quicker than a big

1475.75 --> 1479.02
guy for example

1476.86 --> 1481.99
oh that's to be first careful but I have

1479.02 --> 1485.429
very sharp senses and I am lightning

1481.99 --> 1488.23
quick especially well yeah when I'm

1485.429 --> 1491.2900000000002
oblivious my intuition basically takes

1488.23 --> 1493.179
control so I have super reflexes I'm

1491.29 --> 1495.46
very proud of it like nothing ever

1493.179 --> 1498.13
breaks anymore in my presence like

1495.46 --> 1502.24
things drop over the counter or fall and

1498.13 --> 1504.3090000000002
I catch it instantly I don't even think

1502.24 --> 1506.77
about it and these reflexes

1504.309 --> 1508.6
I know what you mean many years of

1506.77 --> 1510.94
playing baseball has granted me those

1508.6 --> 1513.3899999999999
skills as well yeah for me it was take

1510.94 --> 1513.39
on earth

1513.47 --> 1520.25
I focused a lot on that skill and yeah I

1518.27 --> 1522.35
can't touch my toes my dog never been

1520.25 --> 1525.26
good at that's overthink yeah me neither

1522.35 --> 1527.4189999999999
but I I did kind of do it today hold on

1525.26 --> 1534.32
let me put you on the screen here they

1527.419 --> 1537.1100000000001
look yeah yeah but those are the sports

1534.32 --> 1543.53
as far as hobbies concerns

1537.11 --> 1547.85
I like strategical thinking a lot

1543.53 --> 1550.4289999999999
so mostly strategy games I've done Magic

1547.85 --> 1552.08
the Gathering the card game earlier the

1550.429 --> 1554.39
earlier version is become way too

1552.08 --> 1556.9089999999999
elaborate for me I can't even recognize

1554.39 --> 1559.4
it anymore these days what it's become

1556.909 --> 1562.0100000000002
but I was very fanatical about that

1559.4 --> 1564.65
still have some of these you're still

1562.01 --> 1570.08
right no I don't have anyone to play

1564.65 --> 1573.799
with my son yeah I still do people who

1570.08 --> 1578.3899999999999
play but they're all updated like 10 or

1573.799 --> 1582.59
20 years my cards are from the 90s a lot

1578.39 --> 1587.0900000000001
of money some of those goods I don't

1582.59 --> 1589.6399999999999
like to elaborate on that but yeah I did

1587.09 --> 1592.789
have extremely expensive cards and but I

1589.64 --> 1594.98
had to sell them I said I don't have any

1592.789 --> 1597.98
mortgages I don't have any more of the

1594.98 --> 1601.1
top hundred cards basically I did have

1597.98 --> 1604.73
some of them but yeah I still have yeah

1601.1 --> 1610.039
I know some of these cards are like 10

1604.73 --> 1612.47
or up to 30 euros oh yeah it's pretty

1610.039 --> 1614.299
good yeah I know but I'm not putting

1612.47 --> 1618.53
them away they're like complete sets I

1614.299 --> 1620.87
have like four or five decks that can

1618.53 --> 1623.78
that are all really well worked out

1620.87 --> 1626.6589999999999
really themed and that are very viable

1623.78 --> 1631.24
to play against one another so it's like

1626.659 --> 1631.24
a closed game almost what I made of

1632.34 --> 1636.37
so do you remember do you remember the

1634.57 --> 1639.789
guy you've not had a quiet still yet boy

1636.37 --> 1642.3999999999999
I'll never forget his dinner never is

1639.789 --> 1646.299
that after that pretty much I translated

1642.4 --> 1648.5800000000002
into Dungeons & Dragons D&D before just

1646.299 --> 1652.45
role-playing and we tried out a loss a

1648.58 --> 1655.809
lot of weird tests cases of role-playing

1652.45 --> 1659.3400000000001
games and yeah D&D is what I ended up

1655.809 --> 1661.8999999999999
with and that stuck nice to this day

1659.34 --> 1664.27
it's very popular do you remember any of

1661.9 --> 1667.0300000000002
the spells or anything that that you

1664.27 --> 1669.01
have to cast in in those games are you

1667.03 --> 1671.799
serious you don't

1669.01 --> 1675.1589999999999
there are thousands like could we saw

1671.799 --> 1677.9189999999999
ever see them but I do know a lot yeah

1675.159 --> 1682.7800000000002
come on what is logically possible I

1677.919 --> 1685.7800000000002
know the spectrum of magic about I've

1682.78 --> 1688.44
designed spells hundreds of them oh I

1685.78 --> 1691.45
woke I redesigned the book basically

1688.44 --> 1693.52
it's called trolls and tyrants it's like

1691.45 --> 1696.039
what's it want to have thousand pages

1693.52 --> 1699.85
now of technical rules and news new

1696.039 --> 1702.07
designs and yeah it's a big hobby

1699.85 --> 1705.6399999999999
did you give can you give me one of your

1702.07 --> 1706.8999999999999
spell's let's hear one all right well I

1705.64 --> 1710.95
redesigned

1706.9 --> 1714.159
the teleport the telekinesis spelled the

1710.95 --> 1716.2
plane shifting spells the oldest crying

1714.159 --> 1718.0
spells I completely redefined them

1716.2 --> 1721.24
because they were kind of loosely

1718.0 --> 1725.89
interpreted and I took that away and

1721.24 --> 1728.6200000000001
made an a full scale balancing to give

1725.89 --> 1731.169
them a proper place within the entire

1728.62 --> 1736.1789999999999
spectrum of power you can achieve within

1731.169 --> 1738.4
D&D as to make it more challenging to

1736.179 --> 1741.49
work with instead of a game breaker

1738.4 --> 1743.47
because magic in D&D used to be because

1741.49 --> 1746.11
of its extensive nough sag aim breaker

1743.47 --> 1747.789
so if you had a wizard and you will

1746.11 --> 1750.3999999999999
properly prepare you could just destroy

1747.789 --> 1752.74
anything without them being able to do

1750.4 --> 1755.919
anything about it almost like that so

1752.74 --> 1759.73
what I did is try to take a lot of these

1755.919 --> 1762.51
game breakers and redesign them so that

1759.73 --> 1766.89
they would still be powerful but now

1762.51 --> 1770.51
and I try to balance out a lot I'll show

1766.89 --> 1770.51
you some sure why not

1779.97 --> 1783.559
artist needs to boot up

1784.809 --> 1792.009
see you wanted to see you smell right

1788.429 --> 1796.23
okay I'll present can you recite it for

1792.009 --> 1801.57
us yeah you read it oh I can present it

1796.23 --> 1801.57
I'll present it on my screen over here

1801.84 --> 1811.48
see how does that work oh my god

1808.81 --> 1815.35
share screen this is such an awkward

1811.48 --> 1816.88
system this anyway shares my maybe just

1815.35 --> 1820.1499999999999
get it up on your screen and right at it

1816.88 --> 1821.7700000000002
I'm presenting it here in the second

1820.15 --> 1825.39
screen oh yeah here we go

1821.77 --> 1829.8
so everyone can see this if I'm correct

1825.39 --> 1833.0400000000002
see yep oh it is a little small though

1829.8 --> 1839.37
let's see maybe I'll full screen it for

1833.04 --> 1839.37
through OBS let's see how I do that

1843.27 --> 1847.82
yeah I'll just do it like this

1847.99 --> 1856.39
oink

1850.37 --> 1859.9699999999998
oh well that's big yeah right so this is

1856.39 --> 1866.6000000000001
72 pages of every spell I remade this as

1859.97 --> 1869.09
a list a lot and this is a summary well

1866.6 --> 1872.1499999999999
you really got into that I've been

1869.09 --> 1876.47
working on this over 10 years 12 years

1872.15 --> 1879.5900000000001
actually but most of the dis is finished

1876.47 --> 1883.22
so I haven't really changed a lot in the

1879.59 --> 1886.36
last two years added some things let's

1883.22 --> 1889.8500000000001
see let's go to the teleport spell

1886.36 --> 1893.36
revisit it it's long long text so it's

1889.85 --> 1896.48
this block over here to here up to there

1893.36 --> 1898.4599999999998
okay let me let me talk it's it's almost

1896.48 --> 1901.909
like lawyer talk in a way but it's game

1898.46 --> 1904.429
technical so okay first you have the

1901.909 --> 1907.25
name teleport and the designation to

1904.429 --> 1908.99
revisit it because it it already exists

1907.25 --> 1911.24
it's not something I invented from

1908.99 --> 1913.7
scratch then you have the Magic School

1911.24 --> 1915.799
in this case it's conjuration with sub

1913.7 --> 1918.2
designation teleportation because that

1915.799 --> 1922.46
is a specific style within conjuration

1918.2 --> 1926.3600000000001
then you have the level of the spell and

1922.46 --> 1930.2
that is v and it's also travel domain

1926.36 --> 1934.76
that's that has to do with priests they

1930.2 --> 1938.24
have extra domains like diet ear elated

1934.76 --> 1941.39
themes that come with their own magic so

1938.24 --> 1944.39
it can be found among certain wizards as

1941.39 --> 1946.1000000000001
well I mean certain clerics then you

1944.39 --> 1948.0490000000002
have components that you require in this

1946.1 --> 1951.77
case is only a verbal component you

1948.049 --> 1954.289
don't need your hands to do anything you

1951.77 --> 1959.09
have to casting time and now that is the

1954.289 --> 1961.46
timetable in the work with turns and a

1959.09 --> 1963.32
turn is technically six seconds and you

1961.46 --> 1966.46
have certain type of actions you can do

1963.32 --> 1969.5
within a turn it's very very much like a

1966.46 --> 1972.71
set of comparable to Magic the Gathering

1969.5 --> 1974.39
is there a limitation on how long you

1972.71 --> 1979.46
have to cast yourself

1974.39 --> 1980.89
yes it's one constant you can have one

1979.46 --> 1983.32
standard action in a four

1980.89 --> 1986.74
action and you can have another move

1983.32 --> 1990.37
action with it or another move related

1986.74 --> 1993.429
action say it cast a spell and have a

1990.37 --> 1996.5189999999998
move in the same action right but that's

1993.429 --> 1998.47
in one turn you want to anyway then you

1996.519 --> 2001.44
have the range of the spell that is how

1998.47 --> 2004.429
far away sorry you've got six minutes to

2001.44 --> 2005.7
perform that of you know six seconds a

2004.429 --> 2009.63
second sorry

2005.7 --> 2011.97
yeah round is six seconds and wow you do

2009.63 --> 2016.1390000000001
it so your spells have to be short and

2011.97 --> 2018.269
concise they most of them are but there

2016.139 --> 2020.9399999999998
are some special spells non-combat

2018.269 --> 2023.48
spells that take more that take could

2020.94 --> 2025.74
take an hour or even a day to cast oh

2023.48 --> 2027.75
[ __ ] well maybe we maybe you could

2025.74 --> 2029.159
recite one of your I'm sure to spell so

2027.75 --> 2031.23
we don't take up too much of the hangout

2029.159 --> 2033.8700000000001
time well I'm not done yet

2031.23 --> 2036.8600000000001
so okay I'm Nadia this is just the

2033.87 --> 2039.57
technicals anyway you have the targeting

2036.86 --> 2041.6999999999998
how many can be affected with one

2039.57 --> 2043.1689999999999
casting and then the duration oh it's an

2041.7 --> 2046.289
instantaneous effect there's no

2043.169 --> 2048.629
enchantment happening after you cast it

2046.289 --> 2051.96
so okay you can instantly move yourself

2048.629 --> 2054.99
and/or up to one touched creature per

2051.96 --> 2057.96
caster levels to any location you know

2054.99 --> 2060.6899999999996
off on the plane you currently reside on

2057.96 --> 2063.2400000000002
not further away than hundred miles per

2060.69 --> 2065.01
caster level you have to know the

2063.24 --> 2067.56
location by having seen it or

2065.01 --> 2070.619
experienced it in another way by for

2067.56 --> 2073.08
example a vision or by a scrying spell

2070.619 --> 2076.05
or seeing an image in another's mind

2073.08 --> 2079.619
through telepathy who has been in the

2076.05 --> 2082.139
location you also have to know its of

2079.619 --> 2084.089
its position relative to other locations

2082.139 --> 2086.04
that are familiar to you on the same

2084.089 --> 2088.679
plane to be able to go there with

2086.04 --> 2090.419
teleport if you teleport another willing

2088.679 --> 2092.01
creature or together with another

2090.419 --> 2093.629
winning creature you can use the

2092.01 --> 2096.2400000000002
creatures knowledge to determine the

2093.629 --> 2097.95
destination of the teleportation you can

2096.24 --> 2100.14
trick a creature into revealing the

2097.95 --> 2102.66
knowledge or read their mind magically

2100.14 --> 2105.33
you cannot use another's knowledge this

2102.66 --> 2107.8199999999997
way to teleport yourself somewhere while

2105.33 --> 2111.21
leaving the party with the knowledge of

2107.82 --> 2113.04
the location behind if you would choose

2111.21 --> 2116.7
to use teleport teleport to a location

2113.04 --> 2119.04
that you know but that has changed

2116.7 --> 2121.7999999999997
dramatically outside of your knowledge

2119.04 --> 2124.17
you still teleport to the location but

2121.8 --> 2126.03
there may be unforeseen consequences

2124.17 --> 2128.19
like for example teleporting over a

2126.03 --> 2130.4900000000002
ravine or into an active volcano or in

2128.19 --> 2133.23
the middle of a newly shaped Mountain

2130.49 --> 2135.569
when you tell apart into a solid surface

2133.23 --> 2138.839
this way you arrive at the nearest open

2135.569 --> 2141.27
location but not necessarily on a stable

2138.839 --> 2144.48
solid surface all teleported this way

2141.27 --> 2146.7599999999998
get one magic damage per 5 feet away

2144.48 --> 2149.339
from the designated location you could

2146.76 --> 2153.2700000000004
appear just over a cliff if it happens

2149.339 --> 2156.0299999999997
to be the closest open space to your

2153.27 --> 2157.89
original destination if you use teleport

2156.03 --> 2159.9900000000002
to teleport yourself and/or another

2157.89 --> 2162.0
creature to a false location which

2159.99 --> 2164.609
technically means the location that has

2162.0 --> 2167.43
never existed or does not yet exist in

2164.609 --> 2169.38
its known form like for example location

2167.43 --> 2171.839
produced by a false vision or for sites

2169.38 --> 2174.78
though the teleport spell randomly sent

2171.839 --> 2176.52
you and/or your target one mile per

2174.78 --> 2178.619
caster level away from your current

2176.52 --> 2180.99
location in the horizontal direction

2178.619 --> 2182.9700000000003
this could also result in being

2180.99 --> 2186.1189999999997
teleported into a for example Mountain

2182.97 --> 2187.74
in midair you cannot use teleport to

2186.119 --> 2188.9100000000003
teleport a certain distance in a

2187.74 --> 2191.04
specific direction

2188.91 --> 2193.83
you can only use teleport to move to

2191.04 --> 2196.2599999999998
locations that you know this however

2193.83 --> 2198.5989999999997
also includes a location that you can

2196.26 --> 2201.42
vaguely see in the distance but another

2198.599 --> 2203.4
location exit for example concealed

2201.42 --> 2204.27
behind a mountain unless you've been

2203.4 --> 2207.75
there before

2204.27 --> 2210.15
there is no sign sorry

2207.75 --> 2213.349
so you can't teleport to somewhere you

2210.15 --> 2217.319
you can't see or even see exactly that

2213.349 --> 2219.3590000000004
was the rule that I imposed on it that

2217.319 --> 2222.75
makes it a very technical thing to deal

2219.359 --> 2224.52
with and actually demands exploration

2222.75 --> 2226.5
you can't just now certainly teleport

2224.52 --> 2228.569
anywhere so the exploration becomes

2226.5 --> 2232.53
completely superfluous that was a big

2228.569 --> 2235.14
problem before right so there is no size

2232.53 --> 2238.23
limit with teleportation but you cannot

2235.14 --> 2240.839
take with you anything you cannot carry

2238.23 --> 2242.85
with you this includes equipment in your

2240.839 --> 2244.95
backpack on your belt in your head

2242.85 --> 2247.2
or clothing you are wearing you cannot

2244.95 --> 2249.66
take an object with you just by touching

2247.2 --> 2252.24
it as you cast the spell even if you

2249.66 --> 2254.25
could technically carry it you have to

2252.24 --> 2255.87
carry it while casting teleport to be

2254.25 --> 2258.39
able to take it with you the only thing

2255.87 --> 2261.39
you can take with you that don't require

2258.39 --> 2263.46
a carrying are other creatures the other

2261.39 --> 2265.3199999999997
creatures can also take with them what

2263.46 --> 2268.2
they can carry and there is no size

2265.32 --> 2270.54
limit to the creatures the caster is

2268.2 --> 2272.49
able to take with them you cannot use

2270.54 --> 2275.67
teleport to transport unwilling

2272.49 --> 2282.6899999999996
creatures so that was this teleport

2275.67 --> 2285.66
spell in its operation very good so can

2282.69 --> 2288.87
you recite one of the spells the actual

2285.66 --> 2291.27
spell itself or is that something you do

2288.87 --> 2294.27
with the roll of the dice oh you mean

2291.27 --> 2296.34
like the casting words or whatever yes

2294.27 --> 2298.77
well there are none you can imagine

2296.34 --> 2302.82
whatever you like I like the baldur's

2298.77 --> 2305.67
gate sound thingy where they use

2302.82 --> 2309.84
specific Roman words three Roman words

2305.67 --> 2312.17
in sequence so for every specific spell

2309.84 --> 2317.4900000000002
school that was really good so for

2312.17 --> 2321.42
example NZ spells which are also healing

2317.49 --> 2326.2799999999997
spells by the way they used vita mortise

2321.42 --> 2329.61
cureo which means life that death time

2326.28 --> 2335.01
if I'm not mistaken I think I felt a

2329.61 --> 2337.23
little tingle yeah it's just a game but

2335.01 --> 2339.03
I always like that that sound bite that

2337.23 --> 2341.87
they used in the game was very

2339.03 --> 2341.8700000000003
interesting

2343.45 --> 2349.839
anyway yeah that's it's very detailed my

2347.89 --> 2350.8289999999997
coupon into a lot of detail if you had

2349.839 --> 2354.0589999999997
no idea

2350.829 --> 2359.1090000000004
most of these spell right I've rewritten

2354.059 --> 2361.869
five to 20 times or just worked on one

2359.109 --> 2363.549
spell for two weeks in a row just why

2361.869 --> 2367.71
don't you write short stories right I

2363.549 --> 2373.5
also do that well there you go okay I

2367.71 --> 2377.079
absolutely do that no I can't imprison

2373.5 --> 2379.569
such a quaint system but yeah I have

2377.079 --> 2382.4700000000003
written some stories I wanted to write

2379.569 --> 2386.41
more but they've always been very short

2382.47 --> 2390.73
like more like scripts basically I have

2386.41 --> 2394.96
just I'm very visual and design oriented

2390.73 --> 2397.66
and like set up of groups of cultural

2394.96 --> 2399.2200000000003
groups in contrast with each other and

2397.66 --> 2400.45
against one another and then see the

2399.22 --> 2403.569
dynamics that's what I'm always

2400.45 --> 2407.6189999999997
fascinated about in stories and that's

2403.569 --> 2410.799
how I write stories very conceptual I'm

2407.619 --> 2414.599
not really a literature kind of person

2410.799 --> 2417.25
that really goes into the fine details

2414.599 --> 2422.02
the rarunga bond at the heart

2417.25 --> 2425.559
I'm just very conceptual but I have

2422.02 --> 2432.45
written it was originally a game concept

2425.559 --> 2435.7900000000004
I've written a time travel story system

2432.45 --> 2438.43
yeah it was pretty fascinating called

2435.79 --> 2441.369
the age of paradox it's about time

2438.43 --> 2444.069
travel and paradoxes and giving a

2441.369 --> 2447.13
technical system for what happens how it

2444.069 --> 2451.839
happens and just the atmosphere of what

2447.13 --> 2455.26
would be going on in this age and yeah

2451.839 --> 2458.5
by now a man like Netflix is drowning in

2455.26 --> 2461.17
time-travel [ __ ] it's crazy but yeah a

2458.5 --> 2466.96
lot of it does kind of go into the

2461.17 --> 2470.6800000000003
concept yeah it's la la la la hey Randy

2466.96 --> 2474.25

interesting hi rich you wanted to talk

2640.18 --> 2650.2889999999998
about something on volume but it's

2649.299 --> 2663.18
manageable

2650.289 --> 2666.3590000000004
have you got hit points which are you

2663.18 --> 2670.39

2670.39 --> 2676.8089999999997
Territorian what why is that it is from

2674.829 --> 2680.88
its please from the Northern Territory

2676.809 --> 2687.19
Australia Northern Territory Australia

2680.88 --> 2692.98
what's the difference our capital

2687.19 --> 2697.7200000000003
Australia has the story has a few states

2692.98 --> 2700.39
and two territories one of the

2697.72 --> 2702.779
territories is the Australian Capital

2700.39 --> 2705.3089999999997
Territory which is e which is camera and

2702.779 --> 2706.72
and the other one is the Northern

2705.309 --> 2710.4990000000003
Territory which is a part of South

2706.72 --> 2712.6299999999997
Australia all right and that's where and

2710.499 --> 2716.019
that's where which is written in the

2712.63 --> 2719.739
Northern Territory you know it's not

2716.019 --> 2722.069
really in Australia just too too close

2719.739 --> 2722.069
to the equator

2727.4 --> 2735.7200000000003
it's pretty tropical you know what I

2732.0 --> 2737.85

3096.02 --> 3101.81
just a fragment of what's out there

3099.47 --> 3103.6899999999996
the people that don't care but these

3101.81 --> 3105.98
people don't care about anything

3103.69 --> 3111.2000000000003
patrie your approach is all wrong

3105.98 --> 3125.51
Patrick that's not how you approach

3111.2 --> 3125.99
these things if you want off down a

3125.51 --> 3130.03
building

3125.99 --> 3132.74
you used the appropriate tools you know

3130.03 --> 3134.9300000000003
how I approach someone trying to kick me

3132.74 --> 3136.91
off the platforms and silence me how

3134.93 --> 3138.71
should I approach someone like that well

3136.91 --> 3142.19
it's how you conversation in the first

3138.71 --> 3144.92
place you use a bulldozer I am you know

3142.19 --> 3147.73
you don't come in like a raving lunatic

3144.92 --> 3150.59
and expect to get treated respectfully

3147.73 --> 3153.95
you guys have been trying to ban me and

3150.59 --> 3155.57
kick me off platforms because you're

3153.95 --> 3165.23
Miss Mary but you're lying about the

3155.57 --> 3166.7000000000003
Flat Earth rolls comics right so it's

3165.23 --> 3167.84
just fun to give you some I was just

3166.7 --> 3170.24
trying to give you some constructive

3167.84 --> 3172.65
criticism Patrick

3170.24 --> 3183.1699999999996
to do that's what I was trying to do is

3172.65 --> 3187.83
all right so that's that I am going to

3183.17 --> 3192.5
see if I can do that again and this time

3187.83 --> 3192.5
there will be no more public link

3197.15 --> 3207.279
hold on I'm not gonna make silly mistake

3200.329 --> 3207.279
like that let's see

3211.05 --> 3215.67
mmm just for a short moment

3218.31 --> 3223.32
let's see if I can get at least Randy

3220.74 --> 3227.4599999999996
back but apparently the entire snipey

3223.32 --> 3231.84
thingy has absolutely no use here that's

3227.46 --> 3234.84
a huge massive disappointment and I find

3231.84 --> 3237.8900000000003
this interface of just clicking go and

3234.84 --> 3241.11
doing a hangout absolutely

3237.89 --> 3243.39
shitty it's the worst kind of interface

3241.11 --> 3245.46
anyone could provide in a social media

3243.39 --> 3248.79
platform you can do absolutely nothing

3245.46 --> 3251.0
with it it's worthless completely and

3248.79 --> 3258.11
utterly useless

3251.0 --> 3258.11
so let's do this again

3266.339 --> 3269.719
with a new link

3282.36 --> 3287.09
so yeah you can join or you not

3293.74 --> 3301.7799999999997
P Mars Needs some solitary time needs a

3299.47 --> 3303.97
lot of white surrounding him so he can

3301.78 --> 3308.6800000000003
calm his mind and just shut the hell up

3303.97 --> 3310.839
and stop [ __ ] over everything

3308.68 --> 3313.0299999999997
because that's what he's doing he's just

3310.839 --> 3315.79
trolling everything he hates everything

3313.03 --> 3321.76
everything at this moment doesn't really

3315.79 --> 3326.32
care and yeah I just let him go for a

3321.76 --> 3329.1090000000004
while just so you people can hear what I

3326.32 --> 3335.369
have to deal with with this guy and why

3329.109 --> 3335.369
I basically blocked him so

3337.3 --> 3342.94
yeah well I guess nobody else is going

3340.45 --> 3345.39
to join right now so I I don't know what

3342.94 --> 3347.83
to do maybe they're still in the other

3345.39 --> 3351.6099999999997
they're in the other chat I basically

3347.83 --> 3354.79
left they yeah they can just talk on

3351.61 --> 3361.69
beyond maybe they're trying to talk some

3354.79 --> 3363.79
sense into ya Randy I know is so weird

3361.69 --> 3367.6
it wasn't there apparently I couldn't

3363.79 --> 3369.5099999999998
find it so yeah thanks at least for

3367.6 --> 3372.4
trying we'll have to figure this one out

3369.51 --> 3374.5
before I throw it in public again I

3372.4 --> 3378.4
guess I'll just have to do it through

3374.5 --> 3381.16
Skype the reliable way until yeah we can

3378.4 --> 3383.53
figure out how to deal with this I guess

3381.16 --> 3385.6
I'll have to ask Nathan anyway I'm gonna

3383.53 --> 3392.2000000000003
