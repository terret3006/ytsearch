185.04 --> 189.92
where cars were supposed to drive

187.04 --> 193.599
because it just didn't have ice on it

189.92 --> 197.04

193.599 --> 199.35999999999999
very easy there wasn't

197.04 --> 202.0
that much traffic out there anyway

the scene and

259.359 --> 266.24
about having interviews about flat earth

263.44 --> 267.6
right and then david weiss came up

266.24 --> 269.84000000000003
because mark sarton says

267.6 --> 271.28000000000003
like yeah david weiss has been doing so

269.84 --> 274.15999999999997
many interviews

271.28 --> 274.96
that he's yeah he's getting a little bit

274.16 --> 278.16
more in

274.96 --> 280.15999999999997
more direct a little less careful

278.16 --> 281.44
because of just the sheer exposure of it

280.16 --> 283.759
was pretty interesting

281.44 --> 286.479
and like but he's not nathan oakley

283.759 --> 286.47900000000004
level yet

288.32 --> 291.84
yes mark and karen that's right

294.08 --> 300.32
it's after the 26 minute mark

297.36 --> 303.6
but uh yeah i watched half of that and

300.32 --> 303.59999999999997
then yeah to start the show

303.919 --> 306.639
hello dank

308.84 --> 311.84
uh

324.8 --> 327.84000000000003
all right so yesterday flat earth

326.4 --> 333.039
debates was pretty good

327.84 --> 333.039
again uh

334.24 --> 339.84000000000003
don't remember what was it about it

336.84 --> 339.84
again

341.199 --> 345.199
i stayed pretty much till the end of the

343.44 --> 346.71999999999997
show then i went out for groceries but

345.199 --> 350.84000000000003
when i came back

346.72 --> 352.8
nathan was already gone if i remember

350.84 --> 356.08
correctly hello

352.8 --> 360.16
m good to see you in chat

356.08 --> 364.08
but anyway after that watch some

360.16 --> 366.319
alex jones or rather harrison smith

364.08 --> 367.12
who's sitting in a lot for alex jones

366.319 --> 368.8
these days

367.12 --> 370.24
like it's not even called the alex jones

368.8 --> 373.36
show anymore

370.24 --> 376.8
probably because of yeah alex not

373.36 --> 378.639
wanting to do every day so he kind of

376.8 --> 382.24
gave it to harrison smith but i think

378.639 --> 382.24
that guy is doing pretty okay

383.36 --> 387.28000000000003
like he's getting much more into it

389.44 --> 395.6
right also yeah played more polish gate

392.84 --> 397.919
three

395.6 --> 399.03900000000004
and it's going so much better the second

397.919 --> 402.79999999999995
go

399.039 --> 405.039
like yeah the first time i was really

402.8 --> 406.24
stumbling it really took me a very long

405.039 --> 409.28
time to get through it i

406.24 --> 410.96000000000004
like even got impatient

409.28 --> 413.35999999999996
and then yeah when you get impatient

410.96 --> 414.88
when you get stuck sometimes i walk away

413.36 --> 415.91900000000004
because i don't want to get angry over

414.88 --> 418.479
it

415.919 --> 419.84
but now that i understood so much more

418.479 --> 423.44
about the game

419.84 --> 425.919
everything goes much more fluid so

423.44 --> 426.96
yeah it's uh it's amusing and some of

425.919 --> 432.08
the music is

426.96 --> 435.44
pretty good uh not all of it

432.08 --> 437.35999999999996
uh right and then

435.44 --> 439.599
rounded out pretty much a day with lift

437.36 --> 441.84000000000003
to fail again

439.599 --> 443.68
i typically go to bed right after i left

441.84 --> 446.88
phil

443.68 --> 448.8
him and his wife i think his wife not

446.88 --> 450.96
girlfriend right yeah

448.8 --> 453.599
having that show talking about crypto

450.96 --> 455.84
and world politics situations and all

453.599 --> 455.84
that

457.84 --> 461.84
i do appreciate his channel still

462.84 --> 465.84
uh

466.319 --> 470.639
yeah that was it pretty much for my

468.0 --> 472.879
activities yesterday

470.639 --> 472.879
uh

474.879 --> 479.199
it's wednesday of course so i'm gonna do

476.72 --> 480.08000000000004
my newspaper rounds later i haven't seen

479.199 --> 483.199
the

480.08 --> 486.479
the title page of the newspaper yet

483.199 --> 488.639
if it's yeah i hope this time they it's

486.479 --> 491.199
not some stupid corona

488.639 --> 492.40000000000003
vaccine encouragement or something

491.199 --> 494.16
because i'm getting sick of just

492.4 --> 496.71999999999997
throwing that paper in the paper bin

494.16 --> 496.72
every time

500.24 --> 507.84000000000003
but we'll see

512.64 --> 516.0
right so yeah i'm open

516.32 --> 522.32
open for sorry

520.08 --> 522.32
whoa

525.04 --> 530.16
yeah what was that saying right yeah i'm

528.64 --> 533.8389999999999
open for uh

530.16 --> 536.24
for questions for discussions

533.839 --> 539.2790000000001
about lots of things i did pick up a

536.24 --> 543.839
couple of news articles

539.279 --> 543.8389999999999
relating like for example apparently in

544.399 --> 551.6
in israel there's this pretty

548.56 --> 554.4799999999999
oh a riot going on with with

551.6 --> 555.519
orthodox jews that are refusing corona

554.48 --> 558.72
measures

555.519 --> 561.2
so yeah pretty impressive it's like a

558.72 --> 565.9200000000001
lot of the times these guys come out

561.2 --> 568.72
to protest they yeah they just show that

565.92 --> 570.0799999999999
like they don't they're not fooled

568.72 --> 571.839
they're not a bunch of sheep

570.08 --> 573.44
and they know what they're protesting

571.839 --> 576.08
about

573.44 --> 576.8000000000001
so yeah that always gives me some kind

576.08 --> 581.76
of

576.8 --> 586.24
feeling of respect for the actual jews

581.76 --> 588.08
right and not the grabblers

586.24 --> 591.279
that just say they're jews and don't

588.08 --> 593.46
really act like it

591.279 --> 596.549
but yeah that happened and

593.46 --> 596.5490000000001
[Music]

600.0 --> 603.76
i'll link that up so you could take a

601.839 --> 606.8800000000001
look at it was like every time i see

603.76 --> 610.56
something like this it's just like hmm

606.88 --> 613.12
interesting yeah me too here we go again

610.56 --> 614.56
like it's just that i've grown to really

613.12 --> 619.839
respect them

614.56 --> 619.8389999999999
over time

625.12 --> 633.839
yeah and against cyanism and all that

635.44 --> 640.5600000000001
i don't know i don't who is that

638.48 --> 647.839
sorry i'm not too familiar with the

640.56 --> 647.8389999999999
names involved

654.16 --> 662.8
hold on

660.16 --> 665.4399999999999
right other than that open for

662.8 --> 665.4399999999999
discussions

668.48 --> 675.839
also about flat earth debates if you

672.839 --> 675.839
like

686.48 --> 689.839
yep that's right nathan

691.04 --> 694.959
yeah i thought you would want to know

692.72 --> 694.9590000000001
that

695.04 --> 698.56
sorry you're like becoming a household

697.519 --> 703.839
name

698.56 --> 703.8389999999999
around thought you would appreciate

714.839 --> 717.839
that

721.12 --> 724.9590000000001
all right then again i bet that the

723.839 --> 727.12
people that they get

724.959 --> 729.76
interviews from and all that they're not

727.12 --> 733.279
all globe or zealots right

729.76 --> 734.959
plus yeah that

733.279 --> 739.04
yeah they're not gonna go on shows that

734.959 --> 739.04
are literally global zealots like that

739.2 --> 745.0400000000001
they know better right but when you do

742.8 --> 746.4799999999999
choose to deal with global zealots yeah

745.04 --> 749.76
then

746.48 --> 752.88
yeah then you either go nuts or you

749.76 --> 755.36
will become a nathan oakley style

752.88 --> 756.079
because yeah it's pure psychological

755.36 --> 758.32
warfare

756.079 --> 759.76
and if you don't have the weapons

758.32 --> 764.1600000000001
available

759.76 --> 767.2
if you get suckered into sympathy

764.16 --> 770.399
then yeah in the heat of the moment yeah

767.2 --> 773.839
it's just the only way to go really and

770.399 --> 773.839
you're very proficient at it

782.24 --> 800.88
right a seth wielder bear

785.36 --> 805.12
wildenberg hello

800.88 --> 808.48
it's a group okay

805.12 --> 811.279
i didn't know that here we go again or

808.48 --> 812.839
rather i didn't know that it that was

811.279 --> 816.24
the name of

812.839 --> 829.839
it because i didn't know that trump was

816.24 --> 829.839
involved with zionists

840.839 --> 843.839
brandon

851.12 --> 857.839
so anybody got any questions

864.88 --> 871.8389999999999
hey rob h

882.32 --> 887.279
go ahead right nobody's gonna ask

885.68 --> 890.079
something i'm just gonna brown around

887.279 --> 893.76
and see what i bump into

890.079 --> 895.76
uh oh yeah

893.76 --> 897.12
wow i forgot to mention that that's

895.76 --> 902.56
stupid

897.12 --> 906.0
of course there was a qe live

902.56 --> 906.0
yesterday i was there too

906.959 --> 914.0
and by the way i noticed the

910.36 --> 917.04
specificity about the bug it seems like

914.0 --> 920.32
in the qe live panel

917.04 --> 922.7199999999999
like in that slot in discord my my sound

920.32 --> 924.48
is just fine

922.72 --> 926.639
but as soon as i was moved in the after

924.48 --> 932.0
show immediately the sound

926.639 --> 932.0
problem started popping up immediately

933.839 --> 939.519
so that really stood out to me this is

936.88 --> 941.8389999999999
just giving a technical report here that

939.519 --> 941.839
was really

948.49 --> 951.61
[Music]

952.839 --> 955.839
odd

959.12 --> 969.049
[Music]

972.639 --> 976.639
why magnetic north and south poles are

975.759 --> 979.6
migrating

976.639 --> 980.9590000000001
well are they migrating is there any

979.6 --> 985.839
actual

980.959 --> 985.8389999999999
like real evidence of it

986.56 --> 992.3199999999999
like was the raw

989.759 --> 994.0
data that was used to come to this

992.32 --> 997.519
conclusion

994.0 --> 1000.0
openly presented or have you just

997.519 --> 1001.759
heard that it is supposed to be

1000.0 --> 1003.92
migrating

1001.759 --> 1007.36
or is there some actual data that it's

1003.92 --> 1007.36
based on that was available

1007.519 --> 1011.839
rob h

1014.079 --> 1021.4399999999999
get a very nice description

1018.079 --> 1021.4399999999999
i'm just asking

1021.759 --> 1025.1200000000001
have you been presented with raw data

1024.319 --> 1028.8799999999999
because both

1025.12 --> 1031.36
these polls are present

1028.88 --> 1032.5590000000002
supposedly in locations that are not so

1031.36 --> 1035.9189999999999
readily available

1032.559 --> 1036.959
to check it out right so if they don't

1035.919 --> 1041.039
bring

1036.959 --> 1043.52
the actual measuring data to the table

1041.039 --> 1047.039
when making such claims it could

1043.52 --> 1050.0
literally just be a part of their story

1047.039 --> 1051.52
right unless there is literally

1050.0 --> 1053.84
measurable

1051.52 --> 1056.559
data relating to it in this case

1053.84 --> 1067.84
magnetics

1056.559 --> 1067.84
then it could just be a story

1073.12 --> 1078.0
changing runway definitely yeah

1076.4 --> 1079.6000000000001
right because i heard the story i've

1078.0 --> 1082.48
been hearing that story for

1079.6 --> 1082.48
20 years

1087.2 --> 1095.76
but i've never actually been

1090.48 --> 1098.24
forwarded or presented with the raw data

1095.76 --> 1098.24
of that

1099.44 --> 1102.3200000000002
yeah i heard it

1102.64 --> 1105.76
you don't have to keep

1105.84 --> 1111.36
putting down the story what's supposedly

1109.52 --> 1114.08
happening according to the story i think

1111.36 --> 1119.36
like everybody knows by now

1114.08 --> 1119.36
that is just paid some attention

1119.919 --> 1124.3200000000002
because even the normies get told that

1121.84 --> 1137.84
story right

1124.32 --> 1137.84
but where is the raw data

1142.95 --> 1149.15
[Music]

1149.28 --> 1154.16
okay if you don't know you can just tell

1151.44 --> 1154.16
me rob h

1161.6 --> 1166.7199999999998
okay well hey if you're not gonna get in

1164.88 --> 1169.3600000000001
there then i'll just put it into

1166.72 --> 1170.88
the theories as to why right so one of

1169.36 --> 1174.08
my theories is

1170.88 --> 1177.7600000000002
it isn't there's nothing actually moving

1174.08 --> 1181.4399999999998
magnetically and it's just a story

1177.76 --> 1181.76
to creep everybody out giving more fears

1181.44 --> 1183.8400000000001
of

1181.76 --> 1187.6
some kind of climate catastrophe that

1183.84 --> 1190.84
may be coming forth from it right

1187.6 --> 1192.799
that's one theory about it the other one

1190.84 --> 1195.9189999999999
is

1192.799 --> 1198.0
it's i guess just very similar to for

1195.919 --> 1201.039
example celestial mechanics

1198.0 --> 1202.88
there's just cycles and maybe there is

1201.039 --> 1206.4
like a magnetic

1202.88 --> 1209.0390000000002
swing of a pendulum virtually

1206.4 --> 1211.76
in some way which causes back and forth

1209.039 --> 1214.64
shift or whatever

1211.76 --> 1215.679
over ages and then suddenly it starts

1214.64 --> 1217.679
moving again

1215.679 --> 1219.2
like that right pendulum have moments

1217.679 --> 1223.8400000000001
where they stand

1219.2 --> 1225.919
they yeah at the edges of the swing

1223.84 --> 1227.6789999999999
there's like a moment of pause then it

1225.919 --> 1228.7990000000002
goes back again and then in the middle

1227.679 --> 1230.72
is the full swing

1228.799 --> 1232.48
and then at the then it slows down as

1230.72 --> 1234.96
soon as it

1232.48 --> 1235.76
passes the middle point or rather at

1234.96 --> 1240.159
first it

1235.76 --> 1243.039
it just uh just takes the momentum

1240.159 --> 1245.1200000000001
and that is absorbed by the the relative

1243.039 --> 1247.28
density downward

1245.12 --> 1249.6
because it's of course denser than its

1247.28 --> 1250.24
medium as a pendulum this is all virtual

1249.6 --> 1252.1589999999999
by the way

1250.24 --> 1254.72
this is just describing the pathway

1252.159 --> 1257.3600000000001
visually

1254.72 --> 1259.039
maybe it is like a swing like that how

1257.36 --> 1261.4399999999998
the magnetics work

1259.039 --> 1264.0
if it is actually happening and i would

1261.44 --> 1277.8400000000001
just see it as another

1264.0 --> 1277.84
well terrestrial phenomenon

1278.4 --> 1282.24
how to climb it now but the thing is

1281.039 --> 1284.64
voice i'm not saying

1282.24 --> 1286.48
climate change did you hear me use the

1284.64 --> 1290.0
word climate change

1286.48 --> 1293.84
right like a very specific specified

1290.0 --> 1298.88
word now the whole agenda tied into now

1293.84 --> 1298.8799999999999
talking about climate shift

1299.679 --> 1304.0800000000002
because if a poll shifts then people

1302.48 --> 1307.3600000000001
theorize oh that's going to change

1304.08 --> 1308.6399999999999
how everything works and thus climate

1307.36 --> 1311.4399999999998
change

1308.64 --> 1314.3200000000002
they call it climate change perhaps but

1311.44 --> 1317.28
yeah i'd call it the climate shift

1314.32 --> 1318.559
it like there is fear of that so is it

1317.28 --> 1322.48
real or is it

1318.559 --> 1324.3999999999999
just fiction brought by the same people

1322.48 --> 1333.84
that told you the north pole is a giant

1324.4 --> 1333.8400000000001
ice cap

1342.64 --> 1347.5200000000002
and i don't know if if it is or if it's

1345.84 --> 1350.6399999999999
just an ocean

1347.52 --> 1353.76
or if there's more land above

1350.64 --> 1353.76
or further north

1354.559 --> 1361.84
right so i hope that answers the

1358.84 --> 1361.84
question

1366.88 --> 1373.1200000000001
there is no north pole well no

1369.76 --> 1376.24
geographic north pole

1373.12 --> 1380.0
i think but

1376.24 --> 1383.76
a magnetic north pole well yeah sure

1380.0 --> 1386.24
there probably is now whether it's

1383.76 --> 1388.799
shifting is another matter that's the

1386.24 --> 1391.1200000000001
story right that we're getting told

1388.799 --> 1391.84
but what is the actual evidence for that

1391.12 --> 1394.4799999999998
other than

1391.84 --> 1396.3999999999999
it being told to us that it is and just

1394.48 --> 1397.6
showing us like oh this is how it is

1396.4 --> 1401.44
supposedly changing

1397.6 --> 1401.4399999999998
but what is the actual data

1401.52 --> 1405.9189999999999
that they derived this from like how did

1404.4 --> 1408.4
they measure it

1405.919 --> 1409.6000000000001
where's the raw data that they drew that

1408.4 --> 1412.799
conclusion from

1409.6 --> 1415.039
have they presented any of that if not

1412.799 --> 1416.0
then it could literally be a giant

1415.039 --> 1418.96
fabrication

1416.0 --> 1431.52
from the get-go you don't know until you

1418.96 --> 1434.799
see the raw data

1431.52 --> 1434.799
what are you talking about

1434.88 --> 1437.7600000000002
never has been

1442.159 --> 1445.6000000000001
what are you saying never had i don't

1444.64 --> 1448.88
know what it is

1445.6 --> 1450.32
i know that i was told when i was little

1448.88 --> 1452.48
that the north pole

1450.32 --> 1454.0
was a giant ice cap and that was

1452.48 --> 1456.0
supposedly melting through the

1454.0 --> 1459.84
propaganda

1456.0 --> 1459.84
of global warming and all that

1462.799 --> 1466.6399999999999
that has nothing to do with the mandela

1470.84 --> 1476.24
effect

1473.279 --> 1476.72
hello big mike s if you watch my columbo

1476.24 --> 1481.36
watch

1476.72 --> 1481.3600000000001
no i haven't seen it you lost it what

1481.44 --> 1487.8400000000001
martha paul isn't on maps what are you

1484.0 --> 1487.84
blabbering about voynich

1532.24 --> 1536.24
greenland took over the north pole

1540.84 --> 1543.84
okay

1551.919 --> 1558.48
well the north pole technically never

1555.919 --> 1561.76
was supposed to be a island

1558.48 --> 1565.52
according to the official story

1561.76 --> 1568.96
it's just an ice cap now if they have

1565.52 --> 1570.6399999999999
decided to now designate

1568.96 --> 1572.799
greenland as the north pole that's

1570.64 --> 1576.159
another matter that's just

1572.799 --> 1579.76
a change in narrative basically

1576.159 --> 1583.3600000000001
check your maps voynich

1579.76 --> 1599.84
starting to piss me off a little but

1583.36 --> 1599.84
sure i'll check it

1604.0 --> 1608.48
what like what maps what types of maps

1606.48 --> 1612.48
are you talking about

1608.48 --> 1616.48
what map

1612.48 --> 1621.6
i don't think the north pole

1616.48 --> 1621.6
was ever designated with a name like a

1624.84 --> 1627.84
country

1634.0 --> 1640.32
[Music]

1636.559 --> 1643.76
right well when each if they just

1640.32 --> 1645.6789999999999
redesignate that area and start calling

1643.76 --> 1648.64
it something else for whatever reason it

1645.679 --> 1655.8400000000001
has nothing to do with mandela effect

1648.64 --> 1655.8400000000001
that's just called a change in narrative

1660.32 --> 1663.6789999999999
hey i'll kill the hope

1667.6 --> 1672.08
right well i've never been on the north

1669.52 --> 1674.24
pole that doesn't mean that there used

1672.08 --> 1676.0
to be a north pole and now suddenly it's

1674.24 --> 1678.08
gone because of mandela effect or

1676.0 --> 1678.559
whatever it just means we got told about

1678.08 --> 1681.4399999999998
the

1678.559 --> 1682.24
story about the north pole we just took

1681.44 --> 1686.0
it for granted

1682.24 --> 1687.039
everybody never paid too much attention

1686.0 --> 1690.08
to it just as

1687.039 --> 1693.52
accepted it to be there

1690.08 --> 1695.36
as they told us and now and during the

1693.52 --> 1697.84
information revolution age

1695.36 --> 1699.279
we're just figuring out like wait no

1697.84 --> 1702.559
that doesn't match

1699.279 --> 1702.559
with the data we're getting

1702.799 --> 1706.08
that's all it's not mandela effect it's

1705.36 --> 1711.84
just

1706.08 --> 1711.84
getting informed

1722.84 --> 1725.84
hmm

1746.32 --> 1752.96
so nice all the bright sun out there

1750.24 --> 1755.2
although you know it does make a little

1752.96 --> 1756.48
bit more difficult to watch my screen

1755.2 --> 1759.76
properly

1756.48 --> 1764.48
because it is my screen which is black

1759.76 --> 1767.76
is kind of reflecting the white light

1764.48 --> 1781.2
that is scattering all over the place so

1767.76 --> 1784.159
but yeah can't have everything

1781.2 --> 1784.159
i kill the hope

1788.64 --> 1794.96
well the those maps those maps with the

1792.799 --> 1796.559
the big island with the four rivers in

1794.96 --> 1799.6000000000001
it right

1796.559 --> 1802.72
well we don't know

1799.6 --> 1806.7199999999998
if that was ever real or if it was

1802.72 --> 1809.3600000000001
made up like a conspiracy of those

1806.72 --> 1812.159
of the map makers mystical island to

1809.36 --> 1815.84
lure them or something

1812.159 --> 1818.24
like a trap for the curious or

1815.84 --> 1819.039
if i don't know the entire nature of the

1818.24 --> 1822.32
realm change

1819.039 --> 1825.36
maybe there used to be this island thing

1822.32 --> 1827.4399999999998
there and then suddenly

1825.36 --> 1830.799
let's just get a little weird maybe the

1827.44 --> 1830.799
loop retracted

1830.88 --> 1835.679
right maybe the north further to the

1834.559 --> 1838.799
north

1835.679 --> 1842.159
became tighter it it just

1838.799 --> 1844.96
the space took it away the space shifted

1842.159 --> 1848.0800000000002
the available space

1844.96 --> 1851.44
shifted closer and so suddenly

1848.08 --> 1853.1999999999998
this island just isn't there doesn't fit

1851.44 --> 1855.76
in there anymore that entire space is

1853.2 --> 1855.76
just gone

1856.399 --> 1861.9189999999999
right something like that yeah it's very

1859.679 --> 1865.279
weird

1861.919 --> 1867.76
but maybe that is going on right

1865.279 --> 1869.679
that could be kind of a science fictiony

1867.76 --> 1872.8799999999999
alternative

1869.679 --> 1873.919
because yeah this realm is pretty

1872.88 --> 1876.0
mysterious

1873.919 --> 1878.0800000000002
i think and there's so many surreal

1876.0 --> 1880.559
factors so who's to say

1878.08 --> 1882.54
you could just exclude something like

1880.559 --> 1885.6
that

1882.54 --> 1888.32
[Music]

1885.6 --> 1888.799
there's always the possibility because

1888.32 --> 1893.039
yeah

1888.799 --> 1895.2
the nature of the realm is just surreal

1893.039 --> 1895.2
so

1901.279 --> 1910.159
right like when you're talking about

1905.44 --> 1912.799
realm encompassing traits and elements

1910.159 --> 1914.5590000000002
occam's razor is not really all that

1912.799 --> 1916.6399999999999
useful

1914.559 --> 1918.48
just because you can figure out a

1916.64 --> 1921.1200000000001
mathematical more straight

1918.48 --> 1922.559
forward easily fitting system that's

1921.12 --> 1925.279
just

1922.559 --> 1925.279
the quickest

1925.76 --> 1929.44
doesn't mean that it's correct

1930.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
no i don't think so

1939.44 --> 1943.039
but then again there is still like a lot

1941.919 --> 1945.8400000000001
of missing data

1943.039 --> 1947.519
and signs of a lot of information given

1945.84 --> 1949.279
to us that hasn't been confirmed and

1947.519 --> 1950.0
that's why i'm trying to figure that one

1949.279 --> 1953.12
out

1950.0 --> 1955.12
more and more i always ask

1953.12 --> 1956.1589999999999
when it really comes to this type of

1955.12 --> 1959.5189999999998
claims

1956.159 --> 1962.3200000000002
like what is the raw data presented

1959.519 --> 1962.72
as a proof because we can't just go

1962.32 --> 1964.72
there

1962.72 --> 1966.799
and test it like oh yeah yeah they were

1964.72 --> 1969.2
right that's exactly how they

1966.799 --> 1971.12
what they said no we don't have that

1969.2 --> 1973.519
opportunity

1971.12 --> 1975.1999999999998
so unless they then present the raw data

1973.519 --> 1979.2
for it there is really nothing

1975.2 --> 1982.72
to go on to even know

1979.2 --> 1982.72
whether it is real or not

1985.36 --> 1988.51
[Music]

1988.84 --> 1991.84
see

1998.0 --> 2019.84
why do all of you who is all of you

2002.48 --> 2019.84
exactly voynich who is this all of you

2023.36 --> 2030.6399999999999
why hasn't that change been announced

2027.279 --> 2034.399
uh well if they're just going to

2030.64 --> 2036.3200000000002
change their narrative story

2034.399 --> 2038.0
flip it big do you really think they

2036.32 --> 2040.0
want to announce it it's like

2038.0 --> 2042.0
oh yeah this what we used to say is

2040.0 --> 2043.039
completely wrong now we're going to say

2042.0 --> 2045.76
this

2043.039 --> 2047.36
right then there would be a lot of

2045.76 --> 2049.679
people that would be like what that

2047.36 --> 2051.5989999999997
doesn't make any sense

2049.679 --> 2052.96
why did you tell us the other story then

2051.599 --> 2055.9190000000003
no no they'll just let

2052.96 --> 2057.04
the other story fade and then start

2055.919 --> 2060.24
saying

2057.04 --> 2063.52
the new way like it

2060.24 --> 2064.1589999999997
has always been and then people will

2063.52 --> 2067.28
just

2064.159 --> 2069.2000000000003
forget about the old system or see start

2067.28 --> 2071.28
to see it as a rumor or whatever or

2069.2 --> 2073.4399999999996
mandela effect if you will

2071.28 --> 2074.5600000000004
whatever excuse and then move on to the

2073.44 --> 2077.839
new version

2074.56 --> 2079.679
and forget about the old version still

2077.839 --> 2081.7599999999998
not having been presented with the data

2079.679 --> 2089.04
that actually confirms any of it

2081.76 --> 2103.8390000000004
right that's how it works

2089.04 --> 2103.839
hello by the way the i ad64

2104.8 --> 2117.8390000000004
when did you start to notice narrative

2106.72 --> 2117.839
around the north pole changed

2118.72 --> 2125.7599999999998
i think like

2122.72 --> 2128.0789999999997
i think around like the 90s

2125.76 --> 2130.5600000000004
it just like when the 90s started they

2128.079 --> 2133.76
just stopped talking about it

2130.56 --> 2135.92
maybe could be wrong

2133.76 --> 2137.599
but for me really over my life it it

2135.92 --> 2138.079
really was originally north pole north

2137.599 --> 2140.2400000000002
pole

2138.079 --> 2142.1600000000003
very interesting also santa claus

2140.24 --> 2144.8799999999997
supposedly or superman

2142.16 --> 2146.56
you know whatever all these things and

2144.88 --> 2148.88
then

2146.56 --> 2150.88
kind of like yeah there's not a lot of

2148.88 --> 2151.6800000000003
attention really spent on the north wall

2150.88 --> 2154.7200000000003
like

2151.68 --> 2156.72
the last remaining reference even to

2154.72 --> 2158.8799999999997
supposed north pole would be

2156.72 --> 2160.72
superman in all kinds of ways because of

2158.88 --> 2161.76
course superman has to has his crystal

2160.72 --> 2164.9599999999996
palace

2161.76 --> 2168.6400000000003
at the north pole according to that

2164.96 --> 2170.8
universe dc universe in which that

2168.64 --> 2172.0789999999997
thing is tied so that's kind of the last

2170.8 --> 2175.52
place you still see

2172.079 --> 2178.7200000000003
the north pole right because

2175.52 --> 2181.52
where is it involved in anything else

2178.72 --> 2182.8799999999997
except santa claus right santa claus

2181.52 --> 2185.2
superman

2182.88 --> 2186.0
those are the last places in which this

2185.2 --> 2189.5989999999997
mysterious

2186.0 --> 2193.119
north pole exists as a

2189.599 --> 2195.76
well a land with covered in ice

2193.119 --> 2195.76
permanently

2196.24 --> 2203.52
or a giant ice cap

2200.64 --> 2205.04
but yeah think about it voynich am i

2203.52 --> 2206.96
right

2205.04 --> 2209.119
those are like the last two places in

2206.96 --> 2213.04
which it is

2209.119 --> 2228.0
still that old versioned north pole

2213.04 --> 2232.56
as a virtual place

2228.0 --> 2232.56
never let santa never live whatever

2232.88 --> 2236.32
i don't know where you're getting this

2234.24 --> 2237.4399999999996
voynich i seriously don't know where

2236.32 --> 2239.52
you're

2237.44 --> 2241.359
where this what you're saying right now

2239.52 --> 2243.44
in chat in the last

2241.359 --> 2244.64
10 minutes is coming from i've never

2243.44 --> 2247.52
heard of any of that

2244.64 --> 2248.3199999999997
i've never heard anybody say always

2247.52 --> 2250.079
never have

2248.32 --> 2252.7200000000003
this is ridiculous i think you're

2250.079 --> 2252.7200000000003
projecting

2255.44 --> 2258.88
i don't hear [ __ ] about the south wall

2257.28 --> 2261.3590000000004
that's not true

2258.88 --> 2263.6800000000003
southpaw is very popular in conspiracy

2261.359 --> 2267.2
circles

2263.68 --> 2269.44
like all these weird elitists

2267.2 --> 2271.4399999999996
go there at times and all that so yeah

2269.44 --> 2272.16
southpost getting in the attention quite

2271.44 --> 2275.52
a lot

2272.16 --> 2276.72
actually and there's all these

2275.52 --> 2280.64
mysterious

2276.72 --> 2280.64
military projects in the past

2282.0 --> 2285.92
but yeah is definitely getting more

2284.64 --> 2288.4
attention

2285.92 --> 2291.599
now so maybe it's like from the north

2288.4 --> 2299.839
the attention shifted to the south pole

2291.599 --> 2299.839
in a way

2304.24 --> 2313.839
there is no cell phone whatever

2314.96 --> 2322.0
there is a south and i presume there is

2318.72 --> 2324.3199999999997
some kind of big ice wall somewhere

2322.0 --> 2325.839
over there i don't know how big it is if

2324.32 --> 2328.88
it is

2325.839 --> 2331.52
if it is really continuous

2328.88 --> 2331.52
everywhere

2333.28 --> 2338.5600000000004
i don't know about that but there's a

2336.48 --> 2341.76
nice wall somewhere because i've seen

2338.56 --> 2342.7999999999997
video footage of it so where is that ice

2341.76 --> 2347.599
wall then

2342.8 --> 2347.599
there has to be a nice wall of some size

2352.839 --> 2355.839
somewhere

2361.599 --> 2366.4
antarctica yeah yeah yeah that's what i

2363.839 --> 2369.599
meant come on

2366.4 --> 2371.599
south pole is just a generalized

2369.599 --> 2374.4
term i guess it's a little bit more

2371.599 --> 2374.4
globe based

2377.359 --> 2380.4
i didn't bring it up

2380.72 --> 2384.48
if you start calling it southpole i will

2382.72 --> 2387.7599999999998
call it southpaw if you start calling it

2384.48 --> 2391.359
antarctica i'll call it antarctica

2387.76 --> 2391.3590000000004
pretty much means the same to me

2393.359 --> 2399.5989999999997
videos can be docked oh really so

2396.48 --> 2403.28
in the 80s and before and like way

2399.599 --> 2406.96
way way before they could just cgi

2403.28 --> 2409.44
giant ice walls like that really you

2406.96 --> 2412.319
think so

2409.44 --> 2412.319
i don't think so

2417.52 --> 2424.0
i've seen pictures of ice walls like

2419.76 --> 2426.6400000000003
even as a very little kid

2424.0 --> 2427.92
or video footage not even pictures just

2426.64 --> 2431.04
moving footage

2427.92 --> 2431.04
old footage like the

2431.2 --> 2437.68
uh admiral bird

2434.8 --> 2438.0
time period footage like i think i got

2437.68 --> 2439.9199999999996
to see

2438.0 --> 2441.28
some of that admiral bird footage even

2439.92 --> 2443.839
as a very young kid

2441.28 --> 2445.52
i don't know how where i got it from

2443.839 --> 2453.839
because it was pre-internet

2445.52 --> 2453.839
but i saw it

2456.88 --> 2464.839
oh just trying to be ironic thanks

2460.319 --> 2467.839
so helpful so helpful to do that

2464.839 --> 2467.839
great

2473.2 --> 2480.8799999999997
yeah well even a 33 degree mason

2476.8 --> 2484.4
freemason in the early 20th century

2480.88 --> 2485.52
can't make a cgi fakery of a giant ice

2484.4 --> 2487.839
cape like that

2485.52 --> 2490.24
and like sitting in ships there and

2487.839 --> 2492.56
walking on it and all that so

2490.24 --> 2493.52
it's all very cute doesn't matter what

2492.56 --> 2496.319
he is

2493.52 --> 2509.839
i'm not talking about even what he said

2496.319 --> 2509.839
just talking about what we got to see

2510.66 --> 2513.839
[Music]

2512.079 --> 2515.2000000000003
doesn't have the best sense of irene

2513.839 --> 2518.48
well no

2515.2 --> 2522.64
it's not about that voynich like

2518.48 --> 2526.0
just because you understand doesn't mean

2522.64 --> 2528.24
that i know you understand

2526.0 --> 2530.24
people have a lot of weird ideas and

2528.24 --> 2534.64
sometimes they want to approach me

2530.24 --> 2539.04
naively to just get that straight answer

2534.64 --> 2541.359
right in that way you can even use me

2539.04 --> 2543.359
to try to emulate what it would be like

2541.359 --> 2544.88
to answer that question how would i

2543.359 --> 2547.839
answer that question

2544.88 --> 2551.839
so if you're just going to say something

2547.839 --> 2551.839
that's kind of stupid

2552.56 --> 2565.839
how do i know it's irony

2568.72 --> 2574.9599999999996
right i don't know i thought maybe you

2572.48 --> 2576.56
really did think that that that was a

2574.96 --> 2578.64
relevant counter argument

2576.56 --> 2581.2799999999997
sorry i don't know you that well rufus

2578.64 --> 2581.2799999999997
saint thomas

2582.8 --> 2586.1600000000003
yes say amanda young

2589.68 --> 2605.87
and for niche don't skip out on the edge

2593.92 --> 2609.909
when addressing her please

2605.87 --> 2609.909
[Music]

2611.2 --> 2615.7599999999998
what about the wildlings who live beyond

2613.92 --> 2619.28
the wall

2615.76 --> 2622.1600000000003
uh what wildlings

2619.28 --> 2622.1600000000003
i don't know man

2625.04 --> 2629.359
maybe there is some mammoth country

2626.88 --> 2629.359
somewhere

2629.52 --> 2635.839
yeah don't worry about it emmanuel i

2632.839 --> 2635.839
know

2660.839 --> 2663.839
huh

2665.359 --> 2691.839
oh brandon yeah yeah

2677.76 --> 2693.28
okay now don't

2691.839 --> 2705.119
they're coming down and start poking

2693.28 --> 2709.28
each other over nonsense come on

2705.119 --> 2709.28
come on iron don't do that

2711.119 --> 2716.4
so yes supposed country beyond the south

2714.079 --> 2719.3590000000004
pole the other region

2716.4 --> 2722.4
is it there there were mammoths filmed

2719.359 --> 2722.4
so where was that

2730.839 --> 2735.7599999999998
like could it instead

2733.04 --> 2736.24
i think i've heard this theory about it

2735.76 --> 2740.2400000000002
could it

2736.24 --> 2743.5989999999997
have instead perhaps be kind of a remote

2740.24 --> 2743.5989999999997
area of argentina

2744.839 --> 2747.839
instead

2748.079 --> 2753.44
or is it really this land

2751.359 --> 2755.2799999999997
south of argentina maybe there is like

2753.44 --> 2759.68
the weird

2755.28 --> 2763.28
like the land supposedly can continue on

2759.68 --> 2767.5989999999997
right all the way argentina is like the

2763.28 --> 2770.88
the southernmost point southern land

2767.599 --> 2770.88
in south america right

2771.92 --> 2777.119
so maybe there is a small region that's

2775.119 --> 2780.88
kind of

2777.119 --> 2781.599
has a warm terrestrial stream or

2780.88 --> 2784.8
something

2781.599 --> 2787.2000000000003
isolated so it still stays warmed up

2784.8 --> 2788.0
within the icy region it could be like

2787.2 --> 2791.04
an anomaly

2788.0 --> 2793.359
like that a unique

2791.04 --> 2794.4
like an oasis in the middle of the ice

2793.359 --> 2796.7999999999997
desert

2794.4 --> 2799.04
like it could be that it could be just a

2796.8 --> 2802.2400000000002
relatively small region that's just

2799.04 --> 2805.44
able to be like that like a small oasis

2802.24 --> 2810.16
in an ice desert because of some

2805.44 --> 2810.16
hot spring that just happens to be there

2810.88 --> 2818.48
in the ground you know it could be that

2815.2 --> 2819.5989999999997
or we could yeah as we love to speculate

2818.48 --> 2822.64
there is an entire

2819.599 --> 2831.839
realm beyond the ice

2822.64 --> 2831.839
at some point instead i don't know

2836.72 --> 2845.839
out here hello dr gonzo

2880.96 --> 2887.839
antarctic interior huh

2888.48 --> 2894.4
okay the eye

2891.72 --> 2895.52
1864. well if you're going to say an

2894.4 --> 2897.92
antarctic

2895.52 --> 2899.28
interior that you're kind of presuming

2897.92 --> 2903.2000000000003
it is an island

2899.28 --> 2903.2000000000003
is it an island is it really

2907.28 --> 2910.0
how do you know

2910.4 --> 2914.48
does that island the border of it the

2912.72 --> 2919.359
exposed eyes will

2914.48 --> 2922.96
like add up 360 degrees

2919.359 --> 2925.72
does it is it

2922.96 --> 2927.599
geometric an island or is it just

2925.72 --> 2931.2
geographically projected

2927.599 --> 2931.2000000000003
as an island which one is it

2938.559 --> 2944.48
i don't think it's an island but i don't

2940.16 --> 2944.48
think it's a ring surrounding our realm

2954.839 --> 2957.839
either

2960.8 --> 2971.8390000000004
an ice plane right

2986.24 --> 3001.1189999999997
it is cold down there absolutely

2998.96 --> 3003.359
and what i'm wondering a little though

3001.119 --> 3003.359
like

3004.24 --> 3010.8799999999997
do they keep track of like the height

3007.599 --> 3011.599
of these ice planes of the ice wall as

3010.88 --> 3014.7200000000003
it were of

3011.599 --> 3015.92
south pole and the growth and shrinking

3014.72 --> 3017.839
of it

3015.92 --> 3020.64
because i know they just checked the

3017.839 --> 3022.88
general ice caps

3020.64 --> 3024.0
that like the ice that's still on the

3022.88 --> 3026.6400000000003
ocean

3024.0 --> 3029.68
like it does break apart melt and then

3026.64 --> 3031.7599999999998
starts growing back again

3029.68 --> 3034.3999999999996
but the ice wall itself does it actually

3031.76 --> 3038.4
change in eye does it grow

3034.4 --> 3041.2000000000003
or is it like this eternally frozen

3038.4 --> 3043.04
piece of water that's just that's just

3041.2 --> 3044.8799999999997
frozen and exactly the same height it

3043.04 --> 3047.2
doesn't grow and it stays exactly the

3044.88 --> 3047.2000000000003
same

3047.52 --> 3051.04
i'm very curious about that

3052.4 --> 3055.599
like is what is the pattern to it or is

3054.72 --> 3057.839
it really just

3055.599 --> 3060.1600000000003
some super archaic thing that's just

3057.839 --> 3069.839
frozen there exactly as is forever i

3060.16 --> 3069.839
don't know

3074.54 --> 3077.739
[Music]

3100.24 --> 3104.0
yes jared sanford that's correct

3104.56 --> 3108.24
[Music]

3106.079 --> 3109.76
the antarctic region are certainly a lot

3108.24 --> 3112.7999999999997
colder than the north

3109.76 --> 3112.8
the north regions

3113.04 --> 3116.159
[Music]

3116.8 --> 3125.8390000000004
then the north pole region

3120.319 --> 3125.839
whatever that is

3134.8 --> 3138.7200000000003
nice wall breaks off at the edges and

3137.119 --> 3142.1600000000003
make icebergs

3138.72 --> 3142.8799999999997
yes okay that's interesting are you sure

3142.16 --> 3146.3999999999996
that's the

3142.88 --> 3150.48
the antarctica

3146.4 --> 3154.079
are those just the floating

3150.48 --> 3156.319
big icebergs that are potentially there

3154.079 --> 3159.2000000000003
at the north pole

3156.319 --> 3159.92
how do you know have you actually seen

3159.2 --> 3163.2
that really

3159.92 --> 3167.76
those really high ice walls that

3163.2 --> 3170.96
just look solid have you seen those

3167.76 --> 3173.76
break off like that are you sure it was

3170.96 --> 3173.76
antarctica

3175.599 --> 3179.92
that's why i asked like i think maybe

3177.839 --> 3181.839
it's literally too cold for it to even

3179.92 --> 3184.079
do that

3181.839 --> 3187.119
like the summer winter cycle doesn't

3184.079 --> 3190.96
even influence it potentially

3187.119 --> 3190.96
at antarctica i don't know

3191.92 --> 3209.839
hello julio pabin by the way good to see

3194.16 --> 3209.839
you in chat

3214.8 --> 3223.8390000000004
that's interesting yeah dr gonzo yeah

3224.559 --> 3228.96
like potentially it could be inquired

3226.8 --> 3230.4
indeed maybe they do keep track of that

3228.96 --> 3231.52
sort of thing i don't know what they're

3230.4 --> 3237.839
really studying

3231.52 --> 3237.839
over there

3262.839 --> 3267.839
right

3264.319 --> 3270.0
right yeah well the eye exploration no

3267.839 --> 3273.359
no no we weren't talking about

3270.0 --> 3276.24
exploration or well me yeah

3273.359 --> 3276.24
he was actually

3276.72 --> 3281.9199999999996
they're not really exploration teams i

3279.119 --> 3283.359
don't think so there's like

3281.92 --> 3286.0
groups that i don't know do

3283.359 --> 3289.92
environmental study or something

3286.0 --> 3290.839
over there i don't know exactly what

3289.92 --> 3293.92
they do

3290.839 --> 3296.0789999999997
really but they're not really

3293.92 --> 3298.2400000000002
exploring they don't just go around

3296.079 --> 3299.79
antarctica exploring it's

3298.24 --> 3302.3999999999996
too hazardous

3299.79 --> 3306.24
[Music]

3302.4 --> 3310.2400000000002
like not even the government i think but

3306.24 --> 3313.359
even though it may be government-based

3310.24 --> 3313.68
teams out there government-based i don't

3313.359 --> 3316.88
know

3313.68 --> 3319.5989999999997
geologists or whatever they do that

3316.88 --> 3322.0
doesn't mean that they

3319.599 --> 3324.2400000000002
can't share data about this sort of

3322.0 --> 3324.24
thing

3324.72 --> 3329.2
you know as long as you don't ask like

3327.04 --> 3331.04
hey what is beyond the south pole or

3329.2 --> 3333.7599999999998
something if you just ask like hey

3331.04 --> 3334.48
do these giant ice walls actually grow

3333.76 --> 3337.92
or

3334.48 --> 3341.44
do parts break off how does it work

3337.92 --> 3345.92
i'm sure they'll know things about that

3341.44 --> 3345.92
from their own measuring and and all

3346.839 --> 3350.16
that

3348.4 --> 3363.839
i don't see why they wouldn't be allowed

3350.16 --> 3363.839
to share that data

3364.88 --> 3369.76
there are also green places like no

3366.96 --> 3369.76
schwabenland

3371.599 --> 3376.48
maybe maybe i think that

3379.839 --> 3384.0789999999997
the neuschwabenland could also be like

3382.559 --> 3387.2000000000003
an inner earth realm

3384.079 --> 3387.2000000000003
like another layer

3387.44 --> 3390.7200000000003
i don't know exactly how it works but

3389.28 --> 3394.559
maybe neuschwabenland

3390.72 --> 3396.9599999999996
is that land beyond

3394.559 --> 3398.0
and maybe that land beyond has changed a

3396.96 --> 3400.7200000000003
lot

3398.0 --> 3401.839
in the last century maybe it used to be

3400.72 --> 3404.319
like that maybe now

3401.839 --> 3406.799
it it yeah like the weather over there

3404.319 --> 3418.13
has changed dramatically or something

3406.799 --> 3421.809
i don't know

3418.13 --> 3421.809
[Music]

3429.119 --> 3435.76
yeah tourists yeah so you can walk

3433.599 --> 3437.44
within the designated area where you're

3435.76 --> 3439.599
allowed to walk yeah that's right dr

3437.44 --> 3441.76
gonzo

3439.599 --> 3443.04
i don't know what that's supposed to

3441.76 --> 3446.3190000000004
prove about

3443.04 --> 3448.5589999999997
freedom over there

3446.319 --> 3450.96
yeah you can walk around that's really

3448.559 --> 3453.6800000000003
cute you only have to pay a giant amount

3450.96 --> 3455.76
of money to get there

3453.68 --> 3456.8799999999997
and then barely be allowed to do

3455.76 --> 3459.6800000000003
anything

3456.88 --> 3461.04
that's such a privilege man that such is

3459.68 --> 3463.2799999999997
amazing

3461.04 --> 3463.2799999999997
not

3472.079 --> 3475.28
i don't even know why ballers defend

3474.559 --> 3478.1600000000003
that

3475.28 --> 3478.1600000000003
i really don't

3480.16 --> 3483.68
like if they actually believe the earth

3482.559 --> 3487.599
is a globe

3483.68 --> 3492.96
then why would there not be

3487.599 --> 3492.96
exploration possible by private people

3493.04 --> 3497.52
by private groups why why shouldn't it

3495.359 --> 3499.839
be allowed

3497.52 --> 3501.119
why are you making excuses like oh you

3499.839 --> 3503.839
can still go there

3501.119 --> 3503.839
why

3515.28 --> 3520.4
yeah but it's not open it's only open

3517.839 --> 3530.24
within the designated area

3520.4 --> 3532.64
where you can't go outside of dr gonzo

3530.24 --> 3533.359
yeah that was my question to you dr

3532.64 --> 3536.48
gonzo

3533.359 --> 3536.48
what's there to defend

3540.64 --> 3545.7599999999998
like why are you saying oh it's so it's

3543.359 --> 3548.88
all right yeah you can still go there

3545.76 --> 3550.1600000000003
why don't you agree that you're

3548.88 --> 3552.2400000000002
literally just

3550.16 --> 3553.44
allowed in a very specific area and you

3552.24 --> 3559.839
can't get out

3553.44 --> 3559.839
you think that is free

3584.319 --> 3588.24
oh just move on right why would you

3587.359 --> 3590.88
answer

3588.24 --> 3593.2799999999997
i'm actually asking you a genuine

3590.88 --> 3595.599
question just move on

3593.28 --> 3596.559
reaffirm what you were doing and move on

3595.599 --> 3599.04
to

3596.559 --> 3601.2000000000003
virtue signal that there's more freedom

3599.04 --> 3615.839
it's so great

3601.2 --> 3615.839
it's nothing stupid about it at all

3631.359 --> 3637.119
okay you don't have any personally don't

3634.0 --> 3640.88
have any interest in visiting the place

3637.119 --> 3643.839
right well why are you then

3640.88 --> 3643.839
bringing all that up

3646.48 --> 3649.599
why are you ring up oh yeah yeah but you

3648.4 --> 3651.6800000000003
can go there

3649.599 --> 3653.44
even though you can actually go there

3651.68 --> 3655.44
everywhere you can only go in a very

3653.44 --> 3660.4
certain spot

3655.44 --> 3660.4
right why are you bringing that up then

3668.72 --> 3685.839
like oh it's already explored

3696.839 --> 3699.839
ugh

3705.68 --> 3713.839
i'll just leave it to you guys in chat

3716.89 --> 3720.85
[Music]

3724.839 --> 3727.839
so

3748.799 --> 3755.839
oh just

3764.96 --> 3768.319
yeah there's no use talking to dr gonzo

3767.599 --> 3772.1600000000003
he's just

3768.319 --> 3772.16
decided to be an apologist

3772.559 --> 3776.6400000000003
he's not really listening it's just

3774.64 --> 3779.2799999999997
moving on trying to scatter gunners oh

3776.64 --> 3781.1189999999997
it's also great it's also free

3779.28 --> 3783.8390000000004
it's all been explored there's nothing

3781.119 --> 3783.839
left to see

3794.96 --> 3801.44
why is it such a hot topic well

3798.4 --> 3803.44
why do you think dr gonzo since i have

3801.44 --> 3804.7200000000003
been talking about it for like half an

3803.44 --> 3806.799
hour why do you think

3804.72 --> 3808.8799999999997
could it be because it might not be an

3806.799 --> 3812.88
island could it be because

3808.88 --> 3814.4
it is vast from whatever vantage point

3812.88 --> 3814.88
you want to look at it could it be

3814.4 --> 3818.4
because

3814.88 --> 3820.2400000000002
maybe it reveals

3818.4 --> 3822.559
the orientation of the realm and there

3820.24 --> 3825.52
might be some land beyond

3822.559 --> 3827.6800000000003
and that is maybe even being known and

3825.52 --> 3829.599
kept secret and used and exploited

3827.68 --> 3831.7599999999998
without our knowing

3829.599 --> 3833.839
could it be that there is a lot of

3831.76 --> 3839.8390000000004
interest in it

3833.839 --> 3839.839
to actually know and find out

3840.16 --> 3844.24
yeah the antarctica trade is absolutely

3850.839 --> 3853.839
bizarre

3866.16 --> 3871.52
you're late to today's topic of

3868.88 --> 3876.079
discussion

3871.52 --> 3880.16
no no you literally brought it up

3876.079 --> 3884.6400000000003
sort of i think it was you

3880.16 --> 3884.64
you've been in there right

3889.44 --> 3909.839
now wait oh yeah you did get in a little

3892.72 --> 3909.839
later that's right sorry about that

3920.839 --> 3923.839
wow

3924.0 --> 3928.559
twenty thousand dollars to fly to the

3926.319 --> 3937.839
fake tourist south pole

3928.559 --> 3937.8390000000004
that's insane

3948.839 --> 3953.92
so

3950.0 --> 3956.559
yeah don't get cocky with me dr gonzo

3953.92 --> 3957.44
just because i corrected myself in the

3956.559 --> 3960.6400000000003
moment

3957.44 --> 3962.64
i wasn't actually apologizing

3960.64 --> 3965.5989999999997
right you're just coming in and then

3962.64 --> 3968.4
starting to defend things

3965.599 --> 3970.6400000000003
you don't even seem to really know why

3968.4 --> 3974.1600000000003
you've literally expressed that in chat

3970.64 --> 3974.16
several times but you still keep

3976.839 --> 3979.839
defending

4003.28 --> 4010.6400000000003
yeah sure

4007.2 --> 4010.64
sure dr gonzo

4018.839 --> 4023.119
no no that's nonsense

4025.039 --> 4029.5200000000004
that not gonna cost 20 000.

4032.0 --> 4035.839
it's nonsense

4036.64 --> 4040.72
i'm not defending except you are first

4039.599 --> 4043.3590000000004
you say

4040.72 --> 4045.359
oh here's a good reason there's a good

4043.359 --> 4046.96
reason why it's so expensive and then oh

4045.359 --> 4048.5589999999997
i'm not defending anything i

4046.96 --> 4051.039
you don't have any interest but you're

4048.559 --> 4052.88
defending it though so

4051.039 --> 4054.079
maybe you don't want to have any

4052.88 --> 4056.319
interest in it

4054.079 --> 4057.6800000000003
but you seem to anyway because you're

4056.319 --> 4059.599
defending things

4057.68 --> 4061.1189999999997
you're defending things talked about

4059.599 --> 4063.599
saying it's all right

4061.119 --> 4065.359
so you have you do have fast vested

4063.599 --> 4067.839
interest

4065.359 --> 4070.16
you want it all to be okay and fine it

4067.839 --> 4070.16
seems

4070.559 --> 4077.8390000000004
it's all right nothing nothing to see

4073.76 --> 4077.8390000000004
folks just go home

4086.72 --> 4093.4399999999996
oh they could blow up the place oh well

4089.839 --> 4095.68
yeah very productive of you but

4093.44 --> 4097.279
in the meantime you're still defending

4095.68 --> 4100.96
them though

4097.279 --> 4104.159000000001
you know you're still defending

4100.96 --> 4106.08
that that airplane ticket there

4104.159 --> 4108.3189999999995
with all expenses would be twenty

4106.08 --> 4109.12
thousand dollars you're still defending

4108.319 --> 4111.679
it though

4109.12 --> 4113.199
despite you not caring whether they blow

4111.679 --> 4115.1990000000005
it up or not

4113.199 --> 4119.839
so it seems like a bunch of excuses

4115.199 --> 4119.839
there to me dr gonzo

4131.679 --> 4138.56
oh really so a private jet trip

4135.44 --> 4140.5599999999995
a private jet trip is gonna cost twenty

4138.56 --> 4144.0
thousand dollars

4140.56 --> 4147.120000000001
really one trip

4144.0 --> 4147.92
or two or i don't know four whatever

4147.12 --> 4151.3589999999995
it's gonna be

4147.92 --> 4160.64
really it sounds

4151.359 --> 4164.319
extremely excessive

4160.64 --> 4164.319
what do you have to buy the plane

4169.839 --> 4173.199
i don't know how they're probably more

4171.679 --> 4189.839
than twenty thousand but it's still

4173.199 --> 4189.839
ridiculous come on

4196.2 --> 4199.38
[Music]

4237.28 --> 4241.679
right yeah i remember that uh robert 96

4239.92 --> 4243.52
euromp

4241.679 --> 4247.4400000000005
it's been that's some time ago though

4243.52 --> 4247.4400000000005
it's like three years i think or more

4249.6 --> 4252.56
but i remember that

4253.84 --> 4259.84
that he did that watch those shows

4282.0 --> 4288.88
the canoe from north new zealand

4285.04 --> 4292.43
120 dollars what

4288.88 --> 4298.499
what are you saying iron x6vi

4292.43 --> 4298.499000000001
[Music]

4298.84 --> 4301.84
26.

4324.08 --> 4328.239
same family runs all tourist companies

4326.64 --> 4331.04
to south to north really and which

4328.239 --> 4334.0
family company is that

4331.04 --> 4335.28
keep hearing about this family company

4334.0 --> 4343.84
but

4335.28 --> 4343.84
you got a name

4350.0 --> 4357.84
instead of 20k just row there

4353.199 --> 4357.839999999999
uh you know how cool it is

4358.32 --> 4361.599999999999
don't think you're gonna make it

4361.76 --> 4374.320000000001
in a canoe

4371.84 --> 4375.04
all right george sanford okay that can

4374.32 --> 4379.199
happen

4375.04 --> 4379.199
i'm not great at names myself

4380.48 --> 4385.839999999999
i'm very glad if i managed to remember

4383.04 --> 4385.84
names

4391.44 --> 4396.08
huh you're dressed around antarctica

4396.84 --> 4399.84
sure

4464.4 --> 4472.239
all right so you can go there by ship

4468.96 --> 4472.2390000000005
what are the costs on that

4475.199 --> 4479.44
or is it just that people get the permit

4477.6 --> 4481.120000000001
and then

4479.44 --> 4483.839999999999
take their own boat there does doesn't

4481.12 --> 4483.84
work like that

4494.79 --> 4497.949
[Music]

4511.84 --> 4516.279
[Music]

4522.84 --> 4525.84
so

4555.84 --> 4560.2390000000005
all right it's all sounds very very

4558.32 --> 4563.28
expensive to me i'm not going to be able

4560.239 --> 4567.44
to pay for any of that

4563.28 --> 4570.239
for a very long time

4567.44 --> 4570.799999999999
there's a lot of other things i need to

4570.239 --> 4574.799999999999
invest

4570.8 --> 4577.92
money in before i could even think about

4574.8 --> 4581.1990000000005
even trying such a thing

4577.92 --> 4583.76
or we'll see where it goes

4581.199 --> 4585.678999999999
like going to antarctica is not on my

4583.76 --> 4587.76
priority list right now if you know what

4585.679 --> 4590.2390000000005
i mean

4587.76 --> 4595.84
but it would be interesting to maybe one

4590.239 --> 4595.839999999999
day do it

4607.12 --> 4614.239
let's go i win well

4610.8 --> 4617.92
oh god yep

4614.239 --> 4620.08
i would almost almost not literally say

4617.92 --> 4621.4400000000005
well i'll just do a gofundme and you

4620.08 --> 4624.4
just this is

4621.44 --> 4626.48
but yeah then oh my god what if people

4624.4 --> 4627.759999999999
actually did manage to get that together

4626.48 --> 4628.959999999999
and then i would have to go to

4627.76 --> 4631.280000000001
antarctica i'm not

4628.96 --> 4631.28
really

4632.239 --> 4637.28
eager to do that at the moment is

4648.84 --> 4651.84
not

4657.04 --> 4661.28
you are used to the cold no not really

4663.199 --> 4668.08
i don't really like cold at all

4668.96 --> 4674.88
i i could probably survive

4672.8 --> 4677.04
but i don't know man with the

4674.88 --> 4680.32
temperatures that [ __ ]

4677.04 --> 4682.4
gets over there i'm i would be afraid

4680.32 --> 4685.12
that i might lose like toes or something

4682.4 --> 4689.839999999999
i i don't really

4685.12 --> 4694.8
i'm not really too eager to do that

4689.84 --> 4694.8
just to go there and take a look

4697.199 --> 4700.879999999999
you know if there was like a bigger plan

4699.92 --> 4704.719
and i had like

4700.88 --> 4707.04
really good preparation maneuvering room

4704.719 --> 4709.44
which would require a lot more finances

4707.04 --> 4721.84
and being mentally prepared

4709.44 --> 4721.839999999999
then i don't know maybe

4757.6 --> 4762.96
yes thomas larson that's right operation

4759.84 --> 4765.4400000000005
high jump

4762.96 --> 4767.6
like an operation high jump is like

4765.44 --> 4771.44
really

4767.6 --> 4776.320000000001
like a critical thing that we know that

4771.44 --> 4779.44
that supposedly happened

4776.32 --> 4779.44
because where did they go

4781.28 --> 4791.84
where did they actually go you know they

4783.36 --> 4791.839999999999
went somewhere

4795.52 --> 4798.96
yeah very funny good doctor gun so i

4798.0 --> 4802.08
know

4798.96 --> 4805.12
i know a lot of ballers out there would

4802.08 --> 4807.44
really prefer arwyn to end up in some

4805.12 --> 4810.639
kind of ice sculpture

4807.44 --> 4813.678999999999
that's really nice but i

4810.639 --> 4816.2390000000005
prefer to just stay over here for the

4813.679 --> 4816.2390000000005
time being

4816.48 --> 4833.839999999999
not too eager to move beyond

4820.96 --> 4833.84
the known realms confines at the moment

4839.76 --> 4843.679
fish pole you mean fish bowl

4844.719 --> 4847.84
fish fishbowl what

4855.92 --> 4863.92
what was operation paperclip again

4861.84 --> 4866.0
i don't remember what that was i do

4863.92 --> 4874.719
recognize the name but i forgot

4866.0 --> 4876.639
what is it again

4874.719 --> 4879.04
oh right right yeah yeah that the

4876.639 --> 4880.639
grafting in of the nazi scientists yeah

4879.04 --> 4889.84
yeah

4880.639 --> 4889.84
of course i'm gonna forget

4892.8 --> 4917.42
hello jason mccormack

4902.239 --> 4921.169999999999
yes yes i got that

4917.42 --> 4921.17
[Music]

4921.199 --> 4931.839999999999
1500 wow i didn't know it was that many

4956.84 --> 4959.84
hmm

4966.08 --> 4971.36
oh come on george sanford you know why

4969.36 --> 4973.599999999999
it's because the north and the south

4971.36 --> 4976.639
pole

4973.6 --> 4980.96
face away from the sun

4976.639 --> 4984.08
somehow or something

4980.96 --> 4986.96
causing all that sunlight to be

4984.08 --> 4988.96
more absorbed by the equate equatorial

4986.96 --> 4991.04
regions

4988.96 --> 4992.38
yeah it makes no damn sense i don't know

4991.04 --> 4995.499
why that

4992.38 --> 4995.499
[Music]

4997.28 --> 5001.92
like how the ballers can even think that

5000.0 --> 5004.239
the realm as we know it can

5001.92 --> 5006.4800000000005
actually function and work within the

5004.239 --> 5015.678999999999
heliocentric model yeah it is pretty

5006.48 --> 5019.36
bizarre isn't it

5015.679 --> 5021.36
rotation gift season it's really weird

5019.36 --> 5025.04
how it even worked the seasons makes

5021.36 --> 5025.5199999999995
no damn sense at all like one of the

5025.04 --> 5029.44
most

5025.52 --> 5033.4400000000005
bizarre suggestions in the entire

5029.44 --> 5036.08
heliocentric model i remember it well

5033.44 --> 5037.599999999999
it's all about you have the sun and then

5036.08 --> 5039.679
you have where the earth is

5037.6 --> 5041.6
in relation to the sun and it goes into

5039.679 --> 5044.56
like an ellipsoid

5041.6 --> 5045.4400000000005
around it and at the furthest points

5044.56 --> 5049.679
it's summer

5045.44 --> 5052.879999999999
and winter like on north and southern

5049.679 --> 5056.0
hemispheres right and then when it gets

5052.88 --> 5058.96
closer then it averages out with

5056.0 --> 5058.96
spring and autumn

5059.44 --> 5063.4
but yeah

5062.56 --> 5065.92
why

5063.4 --> 5067.599999999999
[Music]

5065.92 --> 5069.92
yeah it makes perfect sense if you don't

5067.6 --> 5070.96
think about it if you just say oh yeah

5069.92 --> 5075.36
it's just there and

5070.96 --> 5077.84
it's there and and then that works

5075.36 --> 5080.48
i've heard very little details

5077.84 --> 5082.32
mechanical explanation as to how that

5080.48 --> 5084.638999999999
then actually transpires

5082.32 --> 5088.0
it's just taught that way that's just

5084.639 --> 5088.0
how it works don't think about it

5093.36 --> 5099.839999999999
i know right iron

5109.52 --> 5114.2390000000005
they just think that i don't know a

5113.12 --> 5117.5199999999995
couple of days

5114.239 --> 5120.959999999999
lacking of sunlight

5117.52 --> 5122.96
from one side is going to cook

5120.96 --> 5124.719
the northern hemisphere or the southern

5122.96 --> 5126.0
hemisphere wherever it's summer india

5124.719 --> 5128.87
and freeze the other side

5126.0 --> 5131.96
they really think that that makes sense

5128.87 --> 5131.96
[Music]

5132.96 --> 5138.8
it's like why is the sun less

5136.0 --> 5139.6
intense than during springtime when it

5138.8 --> 5142.56
is

5139.6 --> 5144.320000000001
supposedly geometrically closer to the

5142.56 --> 5147.6
sun

5144.32 --> 5150.32
in the ellipsoid around it

5147.6 --> 5153.52
how is why isn't it actually hotter then

5150.32 --> 5155.599999999999
yeah it makes no damn sense i know

5153.52 --> 5158.2390000000005
it's like they they really didn't like

5155.6 --> 5169.84
to think about the inverse square law

5158.239 --> 5169.839999999999
when it came to that part

5188.159 --> 5192.239
yeah that's very very cute jason

5191.52 --> 5195.040000000001
mccormack

5192.239 --> 5197.28
very cute yeah yeah there's no curvature

5195.04 --> 5198.88
though so it's very cool that you found

5197.28 --> 5203.5199999999995
a

5198.88 --> 5206.32
an explanation on the presupposed

5203.52 --> 5207.76
yeah sphere earth on which you're

5206.32 --> 5209.84
supposed to be on the inside of but

5207.76 --> 5211.6
there's no curvature so it's really cute

5209.84 --> 5214.56
that you got a model for it that

5211.6 --> 5217.120000000001
to you makes more sense it still is

5214.56 --> 5220.320000000001
presupposing curvature though

5217.12 --> 5225.84
which there isn't any so

5220.32 --> 5225.84
sorry it's not gonna work here

5229.6 --> 5236.639
and i think that well flat earth

5232.8 --> 5239.1990000000005
very decently explains why the season

5236.639 --> 5241.04
it all has to do with where the sun is

5239.199 --> 5244.879999999999
being projected

5241.04 --> 5248.639
and what type of sun so literally the

5244.88 --> 5252.96
energy output of celestial bodies

5248.639 --> 5255.36
certain ones change

5252.96 --> 5257.6
periodically like the output and the

5255.36 --> 5261.04
energy output what's coming out of

5257.6 --> 5264.8
that apparent sun the sunlight

5261.04 --> 5268.8
that which hits us it changes seasonally

5264.8 --> 5272.08
becomes different and that is

5268.8 --> 5275.76
regional bound it's very

5272.08 --> 5275.76
specific where that happens

5276.8 --> 5283.84
so the sun doesn't have universal input

5280.32 --> 5286.719
or output i mean right

5283.84 --> 5288.719
like in the south it has a different

5286.719 --> 5292.4800000000005
type of sunlight

5288.719 --> 5294.56
arriving than it has in the north

5292.48 --> 5296.239
even though the wallers like to

5294.56 --> 5299.1990000000005
presuppose that that sun

5296.239 --> 5301.44
is actually a giant ball of fire giving

5299.199 --> 5304.5599999999995
off singular light so why does

5301.44 --> 5307.36
different type of light arrive one

5304.56 --> 5308.2390000000005
half of the planet compared to the other

5307.36 --> 5323.839999999999
half

5308.239 --> 5323.839999999999
makes no damn sense

5346.159 --> 5353.199
measurable radiation

5350.8 --> 5353.92
from the sun emitting from the sun you

5353.199 --> 5356.799999999999
say

5353.92 --> 5357.84
or it's just accompanied with the

5356.8 --> 5362.0
sunlight

5357.84 --> 5365.1990000000005
that yeah it hits us unfortunate reality

5362.0 --> 5369.04
how do you account for it well

5365.199 --> 5372.239
there's light hitting us there's stuff

5369.04 --> 5375.44
another spectrum spectra

5372.239 --> 5378.718999999999
that accompanies it right so

5375.44 --> 5381.599999999999
yeah that's coming from that direction

5378.719 --> 5384.4
in your specific position doesn't

5381.6 --> 5388.2390000000005
actually come from an object though

5384.4 --> 5389.839999999999
you know infer square law does not apply

5388.239 --> 5392.159
if you're going there it's not going to

5389.84 --> 5395.679
get intenser

5392.159 --> 5397.36
and yeah you can't really move towards

5395.679 --> 5398.96
it anyway it's just gonna bend off

5397.36 --> 5400.88
because it's holographic it's not

5398.96 --> 5403.6
actually a thing

5400.88 --> 5404.8
from which that light and the radiation

5403.6 --> 5407.04
comes to you

5404.8 --> 5409.360000000001
that thing you see that bright little

5407.04 --> 5412.96
disc

5409.36 --> 5414.4
it's an apparent disc it just appears

5412.96 --> 5418.96
there it's not actually an

5414.4 --> 5422.159
object it's more like a side effect

5418.96 --> 5424.4800000000005
of just looking towards that specific

5422.159 --> 5424.48
light

5425.28 --> 5430.88
parallel in relation to your location

5428.88 --> 5433.28
it's not actually an object hovering in

5430.88 --> 5435.04
any position

5433.28 --> 5437.28
because if you go there it then it turns

5435.04 --> 5439.6
out that where you presumed it to be

5437.28 --> 5442.88
it's not really there and thus yeah you

5439.6 --> 5445.120000000001
can then say oh but that means

5442.88 --> 5447.28
still that the light is coming from that

5445.12 --> 5448.5599999999995
position that i thought the sun was at

5447.28 --> 5452.159
first

5448.56 --> 5453.04
yeah no it isn't it's just coming from

5452.159 --> 5455.199
that direction

5453.04 --> 5456.96
in relation to that position if you

5455.199 --> 5461.12
actually try to go

5456.96 --> 5463.199
towards the sun from that vantage point

5461.12 --> 5465.36
and you'll figure out that the sun is

5463.199 --> 5468.638999999999
not in that position

5465.36 --> 5470.4
because it kind of bends away it changes

5468.639 --> 5472.08
because it's holographic it's like this

5470.4 --> 5475.199
hologram that's always

5472.08 --> 5477.12
there in the position

5475.199 --> 5479.28
where the light is coming from in

5477.12 --> 5483.44
relation to your position on the earth

5479.28 --> 5484.719
yeah parallel universe now it's just

5483.44 --> 5487.759999999999
holographic it's

5484.719 --> 5489.6
just surreal reality is just surreal

5487.76 --> 5491.679
it's just not that straightforward as

5489.6 --> 5494.159000000001
you would like it to be

5491.679 --> 5496.719
it's that simple or rather not simple i

5494.159 --> 5499.28
know it's very psychologically tough

5496.719 --> 5500.8
but mechanically and the way i explain

5499.28 --> 5503.12
it it is really simple

5500.8 --> 5505.84
it is understandable if you can step

5503.12 --> 5509.199
away from your presuppositional thinking

5505.84 --> 5509.1990000000005
what you've been conditioned with

5509.6 --> 5513.120000000001
that there might actually be an

5511.679 --> 5516.0
exception

5513.12 --> 5518.0
when it comes to light things right

5516.0 --> 5520.639
because we can make lights

5518.0 --> 5521.44
here it's always going to be light local

5520.639 --> 5524.08
based like

5521.44 --> 5526.0
light coming from an object and then

5524.08 --> 5526.88
inverse square law is applied and all

5526.0 --> 5530.639
that right

5526.88 --> 5533.679
well guess what celestial lights

5530.639 --> 5534.639
are not like that at all they're a

5533.679 --> 5537.36
completely

5534.639 --> 5538.4800000000005
different category and there's nothing

5537.36 --> 5541.839999999999
you can do about it

5538.48 --> 5547.839999999999
no manner of reification

5541.84 --> 5547.84
is going to make it different

5548.04 --> 5551.43
[Music]

5557.72 --> 5562.479
[Music]

5565.6 --> 5568.639
huh unfortunate reality that's

5567.52 --> 5571.84
interesting question

5568.639 --> 5574.0
probably yes that

5571.84 --> 5577.28
i don't see why you wouldn't be pro be

5574.0 --> 5577.28
possible to do that

5577.36 --> 5583.839999999999
make a uv light based hologram

5580.639 --> 5589.84
that you could only basically see with

5583.84 --> 5589.84
with yeah uv sight

5613.19 --> 5616.29
[Music]

5630.639 --> 5634.8
right yeah the fake cgi close-up images

5633.44 --> 5636.719
of the sun

5634.8 --> 5638.400000000001
yeah the sun doesn't look like that at

5636.719 --> 5641.199
all

5638.4 --> 5642.638999999999
when you look at it from earth or even

5641.199 --> 5644.719
higher up

5642.639 --> 5646.08
like it just doesn't look like that at

5644.719 --> 5659.84
all

5646.08 --> 5659.84
that big burning ball of gas

5670.84 --> 5673.84
okay

5681.679 --> 5686.2390000000005
the sun is a lot smaller and a lot

5683.679 --> 5689.92
closer no the sun is not an object

5686.239 --> 5693.44
it is not a ball

5689.92 --> 5695.36
a moving light with a specific euclidean

5693.44 --> 5698.239
location that's not what it is

5695.36 --> 5699.599999999999
jason mccormack it's not a lot smaller

5698.239 --> 5702.638999999999
and a lot closer

5699.6 --> 5705.119000000001
you could think of it like that if

5702.639 --> 5707.04
be a little tough on your brain right

5705.119 --> 5707.44
yeah you could think of it like that you

5707.04 --> 5710.48
can

5707.44 --> 5712.719
think of the sun being a little ball

5710.48 --> 5714.0
floating over that disc you can think of

5712.719 --> 5717.199
it like that if you want

5714.0 --> 5719.28
if it's a little tough right

5717.199 --> 5720.48
yeah i'm doing a george musa now for the

5719.28 --> 5723.36
flat earth that's right

5720.48 --> 5723.759999999999
you can think of it as being a little

5723.36 --> 5725.679
ball

5723.76 --> 5727.360000000001
floating over that disk yeah you can

5725.679 --> 5729.119
that's okay if it's a little tough for

5727.36 --> 5731.92
you you can think of it like that

5729.119 --> 5732.799999999999
right it's not though because it's not

5731.92 --> 5735.119
an object

5732.8 --> 5736.8
it's not in the euclidean location in

5735.119 --> 5744.32
space

5736.8 --> 5746.2390000000005
it's just a light side effect very

5744.32 --> 5747.92
yeah with very specific angular

5746.239 --> 5749.839999999999
relations to the position on the earth

5747.92 --> 5751.92
however that's orientated i don't even

5749.84 --> 5754.88
know that for sure

5751.92 --> 5757.679
so it's just an apparent phenomena that

5754.88 --> 5759.04
you could if you presuppose the earth to

5757.679 --> 5763.04
be a very specific

5759.04 --> 5766.32
disc triangulate into a

5763.04 --> 5769.5199999999995
seeming euclidean location

5766.32 --> 5771.679
circle over the earth but if you

5769.52 --> 5774.0
actually trying to confirm the physical

5771.679 --> 5774.96
nature of that specific euclidean

5774.0 --> 5776.96
calculated

5774.96 --> 5778.96
location using triangulation with a

5776.96 --> 5781.36
vantage point of a flatter disc

5778.96 --> 5782.8
you'll find out that it's not actually

5781.36 --> 5786.08
literally there

5782.8 --> 5786.719
right so yeah you can think of the sun

5786.08 --> 5789.84
and the moon

5786.719 --> 5791.44
being balls hovering over a disk yeah

5789.84 --> 5799.84
you can think of it like that

5791.44 --> 5799.839999999999
it's not though it's not

5812.0 --> 5818.719
any evidence for this what

5816.0 --> 5820.239
evidence that it's not a physical object

5818.719 --> 5823.679
in a location

5820.239 --> 5825.5199999999995
or where is the evidence that it is

5823.679 --> 5826.96
why did you try to test the laws of

5825.52 --> 5829.1990000000005
perspective and actually

5826.96 --> 5830.4800000000005
approach it see how it bends away just

5829.199 --> 5832.32
do it with the moon you know it's

5830.48 --> 5833.919999999999
supposed to be a lot closer according to

5832.32 --> 5834.639
helios entrance why did you try it with

5833.92 --> 5837.52
the moon

5834.639 --> 5839.52
go to that moon it's not that far away

5837.52 --> 5841.4400000000005
shitsy grow bigger

5839.52 --> 5843.040000000001
bigger and bigger as you approach in

5841.44 --> 5847.678999999999
your rocket or whatever it is

5843.04 --> 5851.76
bigger big oh it doesn't do that oh

5847.679 --> 5853.84
too bad how bad that's so sad for you

5851.76 --> 5856.96
that you can't prove it is a physical

5853.84 --> 5859.4400000000005
object in a specific euclidean location

5856.96 --> 5861.36
in any form that the laws of perspective

5859.44 --> 5863.199
don't abide

5861.36 --> 5865.199
because it's not a physical object

5863.199 --> 5867.119
because if it was a physical object it

5865.199 --> 5868.96
would abide it doesn't though

5867.119 --> 5870.639
because it's holographic and you can't

5868.96 --> 5873.36
prove it's physical

5870.639 --> 5874.96
the only remaining conclusion would

5873.36 --> 5877.04
logically be

5874.96 --> 5878.0
it's a light based phenomena which

5877.04 --> 5881.5199999999995
places it

5878.0 --> 5887.199
under holographic light

5881.52 --> 5887.1990000000005
image holographic you see being very

5894.84 --> 5897.84
literal

5901.92 --> 5905.76
yeah yeah well why don't you just if

5904.08 --> 5906.48
you're saying it is that far away why

5905.76 --> 5911.04
don't you just

5906.48 --> 5912.48
go in a trajectory to that very very far

5911.04 --> 5915.6
away

5912.48 --> 5918.879999999999
and then watch as the sun

5915.6 --> 5921.04
literally bends away

5918.88 --> 5922.4800000000005
from your trajectory where you're going

5921.04 --> 5924.239
at shouldn't

5922.48 --> 5925.5199999999995
it shouldn't have to do that you know if

5924.239 --> 5929.44
it's actually that big

5925.52 --> 5931.4400000000005
thing that giant amount away

5929.44 --> 5933.36
then yeah you should just be going

5931.44 --> 5934.32
towards it and towards it in a straight

5933.36 --> 5937.5199999999995
line and

5934.32 --> 5939.679
notice as it is gradually slightly

5937.52 --> 5941.280000000001
getting bigger and bigger at the angular

5939.679 --> 5943.28
size because you're approaching a

5941.28 --> 5946.32
physical object right

5943.28 --> 5948.32
well it doesn't do that so it's very

5946.32 --> 5948.88
nice oh you can't get there it's not

5948.32 --> 5952.08
about

5948.88 --> 5952.88
getting there it's about moving in that

5952.08 --> 5955.119
direction

5952.88 --> 5955.92
if it was a physical object in the

5955.119 --> 5959.04
euclidean

5955.92 --> 5960.2390000000005
location then perspective effects would

5959.04 --> 5963.76
apply

5960.239 --> 5966.799999999999
if they don't then it's not a physical

5963.76 --> 5970.08
object in a specific euclidean location

5966.8 --> 5972.0
you don't have to go all the way there

5970.08 --> 5973.84
to confirm it you don't have to fly

5972.0 --> 5976.96
literally into the sun

5973.84 --> 5979.679
to confirm that it is actually a

5976.96 --> 5982.2390000000005
ball in a very specific physical

5979.679 --> 5986.56
euclidean location right

5982.239 --> 5989.678999999999
you just have to go in its direction

5986.56 --> 5992.96
for a prolonged time as long as you can

5989.679 --> 5996.2390000000005
and then see whether it actually stays

5992.96 --> 6000.159
in the specific same angular location

5996.239 --> 6002.879999999999
in relation to your position as you move

6000.159 --> 6006.159
in a euclidean straight line towards it

6002.88 --> 6006.159000000001
to where it's supposed to be

6006.84 --> 6011.360000000001
right

6009.28 --> 6014.4
you don't have to get to the sun you

6011.36 --> 6018.5599999999995
don't have to fly inside of it

6014.4 --> 6018.5599999999995
to confirm that it's a physical object

6019.84 --> 6023.6
just move towards it and see if it

6021.76 --> 6026.719
actually stays in the same

6023.6 --> 6026.719
angular location

6028.0 --> 6037.84
i'm going to predict that it won't

6041.76 --> 6044.88
oh you work it out why don't you figure

6044.239 --> 6047.759999999999
out uh

6044.88 --> 6050.4800000000005
mr sensible in my chat why don't you

6047.76 --> 6052.08
figure out

6050.48 --> 6054.4
how that will work with perspective

6052.08 --> 6057.44
right there's certain claims

6054.4 --> 6058.5599999999995
so there should be certain calculations

6057.44 --> 6061.119
you could probably do

6058.56 --> 6061.6
applying perspective and all that but

6061.119 --> 6064.32
you see

6061.6 --> 6066.159000000001
even the angular size change isn't

6064.32 --> 6067.92
really that important because hey the

6066.159 --> 6069.759999999999
sun is supposed to be very far away with

6067.92 --> 6071.6
the moon it would be much more relevant

6069.76 --> 6073.1990000000005
because the distance

6071.6 --> 6075.280000000001
the presupposed distance is going to be

6073.199 --> 6077.36
a lot shorter so angular size would be

6075.28 --> 6079.04
much more of interest to keep an eye on

6077.36 --> 6081.28
that in the process of

6079.04 --> 6082.159
trying to approach the moon in a

6081.28 --> 6084.96
straight line

6082.159 --> 6086.96
when it comes to the sun it's not really

6084.96 --> 6088.88
relevant it's much more relevant that it

6086.96 --> 6092.719
stays in the exact

6088.88 --> 6095.119
angular position

6092.719 --> 6096.8
because that is what would be required

6095.119 --> 6097.92
for it to be a physical object that

6096.8 --> 6100.719
you're approaching

6097.92 --> 6102.719
right so that would be a bigger pointer

6100.719 --> 6104.159
does it actually stay in the same

6102.719 --> 6106.56
angular

6104.159 --> 6107.599999999999
position in relation to your straight

6106.56 --> 6109.52
line approach

6107.6 --> 6112.0
or will it start to bend away that's a

6109.52 --> 6121.84
much more relevant question to ask

6112.0 --> 6121.84
when attempting to approach the sun

6124.4 --> 6130.799999999999
sure you did sure

6127.679 --> 6130.8
with your moon buggy

6133.04 --> 6140.639
we went to the moon damn it

6136.639 --> 6143.119
went to the moon and then

6140.639 --> 6145.6
they came back from the moon and we know

6143.119 --> 6149.839999999999
because we saw that footage

6145.6 --> 6152.96
remember from the launch

6149.84 --> 6155.1990000000005
saw that footage from the moon

6152.96 --> 6157.36
in the era where they don't have digital

6155.199 --> 6159.44
communication yet they couldn't actually

6157.36 --> 6164.32
transfer that footage yeah we went to

6159.44 --> 6164.32
the moon all right and then

6164.4 --> 6168.879999999999
somehow retrieved that footage from the

6166.88 --> 6173.76
thing that stayed behind on the moon

6168.88 --> 6173.76
filming the crew launching yeah yeah

6174.84 --> 6177.84
sure

6179.28 --> 6182.719
he lost the technology

6182.88 --> 6187.119
it's too difficult to put it back

6184.8 --> 6191.84
together again that crappy

6187.119 --> 6191.839999999999
you know

6192.239 --> 6198.718999999999
like a regular cheap ass

6195.84 --> 6200.8
throwaway mobile phone has a more

6198.719 --> 6202.84
sophisticated computer than the moon

6200.8 --> 6205.84
landing

6202.84 --> 6205.84
required

6207.76 --> 6213.4400000000005
literally a throw away phone

6210.96 --> 6214.96
like the crappy crappy version right

6213.44 --> 6216.5599999999995
that you get really cheap

6214.96 --> 6218.88
i don't know if you can get that sort of

6216.56 --> 6221.4400000000005
phone they have a more complicated

6218.88 --> 6221.4400000000005
computer

6222.08 --> 6226.48
than what the moon lander required yeah

6227.679 --> 6230.96
but it's too complicated to put it back

6229.44 --> 6232.638999999999
together because

6230.96 --> 6234.4
i don't know only the way to put it back

6232.639 --> 6235.84
together is in mass production or

6234.4 --> 6238.0
something

6235.84 --> 6240.400000000001
nobody knows how to do it anymore

6238.0 --> 6240.4
because

6243.84 --> 6248.88
because they don't care

6247.28 --> 6261.84
they don't care whether it makes sense

6248.88 --> 6261.84
or not their reasons

6268.239 --> 6275.839999999999
hmm hey seeking star water

6271.76 --> 6275.84
poor signal today here all right

6276.56 --> 6281.679
i got 15 more minutes of show

6279.6 --> 6283.1990000000005
it's funny to have mr sensible in here i

6281.679 --> 6285.1990000000005
don't know why he

6283.199 --> 6289.839999999999
chose to come in here i don't have any

6285.199 --> 6289.839999999999
objections though

6305.84 --> 6313.1990000000005
right yeah mr sensible i know

6310.88 --> 6314.8
it would be more relevant though as you

6313.199 --> 6317.919999999999
i don't know try to approach it

6314.8 --> 6318.719
with what what is stopping anybody from

6317.92 --> 6321.84
just sending

6318.719 --> 6324.719
one rocket from ground level with the

6321.84 --> 6327.28
camera on it facing the moon

6324.719 --> 6328.4
having gps coordination system at least

6327.28 --> 6330.4
for a while

6328.4 --> 6333.04
close to the earth or who knows with

6330.4 --> 6334.799999999999
satellites out there supposedly

6333.04 --> 6336.88
just with the camera facing the moon and

6334.8 --> 6337.52
then just one straight trip straight to

6336.88 --> 6340.719
the moon

6337.52 --> 6341.92
it's like it could crash on the moon it

6340.719 --> 6345.84
wouldn't matter

6341.92 --> 6345.84
then just see what happens you know

6348.159 --> 6352.719
but uh yeah i think that before you

6350.8 --> 6355.84
would actually get to that point before

6352.719 --> 6358.159
actual angular size changes

6355.84 --> 6358.88
happen apparent angular size changes

6358.159 --> 6360.96
happen

6358.88 --> 6362.719
i think it would be more interesting to

6360.96 --> 6364.8
notice that

6362.719 --> 6366.4
where you thought you were going that

6364.8 --> 6368.639
suddenly the moon just

6366.4 --> 6370.799999999999
it bends away oh wait it's not in that

6368.639 --> 6372.2390000000005
angular location now

6370.8 --> 6374.320000000001
even though you went in a straight line

6372.239 --> 6375.04
toward it and then yeah you're just

6374.32 --> 6378.48
gonna

6375.04 --> 6380.4
chase the dragon because you can't

6378.48 --> 6383.04
ever reach it it's just gonna keep

6380.4 --> 6385.839999999999
bending away

6383.04 --> 6388.0
that's what i predict that's what that

6385.84 --> 6389.6
would absolutely confirm a holographic

6388.0 --> 6391.52
nature and it shouldn't be that hard to

6389.6 --> 6392.639
do that because i think that the bending

6391.52 --> 6395.76
away

6392.639 --> 6399.1990000000005
will happen not that late

6395.76 --> 6400.96
in the traveling trajectory towards it

6399.199 --> 6403.36
i think it will start to happen pretty

6400.96 --> 6403.36
quickly

6404.719 --> 6408.0
i've already like balloon footage

6406.56 --> 6412.84
already

6408.0 --> 6415.84
showed like this type of bending away

6412.84 --> 6415.84
anomaly

6422.88 --> 6430.719
the sun and moon are real film the moon

6427.84 --> 6431.119000000001
it's real it's spherical oh howard moore

6430.719 --> 6434.96
share

6431.119 --> 6436.4
your pain i know in your mind it'll

6434.96 --> 6439.28
probably always be a ball

6436.4 --> 6443.839999999999
and that's okay it's very hard to step

6439.28 --> 6443.84
away from all that reinforcement

6461.76 --> 6468.159000000001
oh nasa what did i say that

6464.96 --> 6471.76
nasa would have to

6468.159 --> 6474.879999999999
do that nah

6471.76 --> 6478.159000000001
but what's why would you need nasa

6474.88 --> 6480.32
to do that right i'm not saying oh let's

6478.159 --> 6481.92
send a man to the moon to

6480.32 --> 6483.5199999999995
proof it's not there or something

6481.92 --> 6486.32
ridiculous like that now i'm just saying

6483.52 --> 6488.8
no just a rocket with a camera

6486.32 --> 6490.08
rocket that could go far the camera

6488.8 --> 6493.1990000000005
right on its nose

6490.08 --> 6494.639
exactly go is showing you where it's

6493.199 --> 6496.879999999999
going

6494.639 --> 6498.32
and on the side perhaps but especially

6496.88 --> 6500.96
that front camera

6498.32 --> 6503.28
would have to be just on 24 7 for

6500.96 --> 6506.4800000000005
however long it's going to travel

6503.28 --> 6509.44
and go towards it and keep

6506.48 --> 6511.199
close track of euclidean registration of

6509.44 --> 6513.04
the angle where it's at don't

6511.199 --> 6515.919999999999
change the angle go straight line

6513.04 --> 6519.679
towards where you originally cited it

6515.92 --> 6519.679
and then just see where is it going

6520.48 --> 6526.799999999999
should not be undoable

6523.76 --> 6529.360000000001
you don't need nasa to build a rocket

6526.8 --> 6531.1990000000005
like that i think

6529.36 --> 6532.88
yeah it's not going to be super cheap

6531.199 --> 6536.0
but you don't need to launch

6532.88 --> 6537.76
some kind of people or a big object

6536.0 --> 6539.84
that will have to return right now it

6537.76 --> 6543.4400000000005
would be a one-way trip

6539.84 --> 6546.4800000000005
just to test it just a camera on top

6543.44 --> 6549.919999999999
launch it and just

6546.48 --> 6549.919999999999
feedback what's happening with it

6551.52 --> 6555.119000000001
the moon mission this is ridiculous i

6553.599 --> 6557.76
said you don't have to

6555.119 --> 6559.44
go to a moon mission you just need a

6557.76 --> 6563.92
rocket it doesn't have to

6559.44 --> 6566.4
carry a weight right that makes it

6563.92 --> 6568.32
so much cheaper so much easier the

6566.4 --> 6569.839999999999
always the biggest problem with exposed

6568.32 --> 6572.88
rockets launch

6569.84 --> 6575.04
is it has to carry all that weight

6572.88 --> 6576.4800000000005
that's what makes it so expensive and

6575.04 --> 6578.56
tough

6576.48 --> 6579.839999999999
it doesn't have to just one freaking

6578.56 --> 6583.1990000000005
camera

6579.84 --> 6585.4400000000005
just a rocket and a camera that's it

6583.199 --> 6587.5199999999995
a guidance system of course that doesn't

6585.44 --> 6591.678999999999
have to be big

6587.52 --> 6596.080000000001
that's it you don't need nasa budgets to

6591.679 --> 6599.76
achieve something like that you don't

6596.08 --> 6611.84
need yeah rocket engineer

6599.76 --> 6611.84
that's all

6618.239 --> 6624.08
china has sent last year robot to the

6621.44 --> 6626.159
moon i didn't see that i know that they

6624.08 --> 6629.36
were supposedly landing on the dark side

6626.159 --> 6632.719
of the moon but that was even years ago

6629.36 --> 6639.839999999999
didn't know they sent a robot there

6632.719 --> 6639.84
you got any link to that ava kilda hope

6641.84 --> 6645.84
need more patrons to pay for it yes mr

6644.159 --> 6649.36
sensible

6645.84 --> 6653.360000000001
so yeah sign up to my patreon

6649.36 --> 6656.5599999999995
absolute if you sponsor me then

6653.36 --> 6658.639
i don't know like i am all up for this

6656.56 --> 6660.56
type of thing right like i don't want to

6658.639 --> 6663.92
go to the moon

6660.56 --> 6666.719
but i yeah i like rockets

6663.92 --> 6668.88
kind of it's kind of like in the extents

6666.719 --> 6670.88
of fireworks i like fireworks i like

6668.88 --> 6674.159000000001
fire i like a fireplace

6670.88 --> 6676.159000000001
i like rockets right i just don't like

6674.159 --> 6677.759999999999
rockets being wasted and all that fuel

6676.159 --> 6680.32
being wasted just to fool a lot of

6677.76 --> 6684.0
people that's stupid but

6680.32 --> 6685.679
to do a legitimate test

6684.0 --> 6687.36
to figure out like the holographic

6685.679 --> 6689.4400000000005
nature of the moon

6687.36 --> 6691.199
or that it's not holographic right it's

6689.44 --> 6695.119
always every good

6691.199 --> 6696.08
experiment or test has a falsifying

6695.119 --> 6698.639
position like

6696.08 --> 6700.239
you test something to be it if it

6698.639 --> 6703.92
doesn't turn out then it's not

6700.239 --> 6706.959999999999
that right so let's test

6703.92 --> 6709.679
physical versus holographic i

6706.96 --> 6711.679
know how to do this shouldn't be that

6709.679 --> 6713.599
difficult

6711.679 --> 6717.4400000000005
just need a pretty good rocket that can

6713.599 --> 6717.4400000000005
travel a very long distance that

6717.84 --> 6722.159000000001
right anyway i couldn't do it all on my

6721.199 --> 6726.32
own i'm not an

6722.159 --> 6726.32
engineer but i would know

6726.48 --> 6731.598999999999
well i would know like what to keep a

6730.639 --> 6734.0
look out for

6731.599 --> 6735.679
when designing such thing not the

6734.0 --> 6738.719
mechanical aspect but

6735.679 --> 6741.599
as when it goes for the test itself

6738.719 --> 6743.28
what we should be expecting when it

6741.599 --> 6746.0
finally engages

6743.28 --> 6750.159
and how just how to deal with the data

6746.0 --> 6752.48
and all that

6750.159 --> 6753.44
can you have a shadows on a hologram oh

6752.48 --> 6756.638999999999
yes

6753.44 --> 6759.919999999999
yes mr sensible yes you can

6756.639 --> 6760.719
yeah you know how that works it's just a

6759.92 --> 6763.52
part that's

6760.719 --> 6764.159
lit up less and then you see it as a

6763.52 --> 6767.599
shadow

6764.159 --> 6771.04
that's right yeah

6767.599 --> 6773.119000000001
now on the other hand why

6771.04 --> 6774.639
why that shadow part which is like

6773.119 --> 6777.839999999999
missing light

6774.639 --> 6778.96
within the hologram why blue would be

6777.84 --> 6782.639
coming through it

6778.96 --> 6784.719
during the daytime yeah you

6782.639 --> 6786.719
like that's already a sign like yeah

6784.719 --> 6788.4800000000005
it's not actually a shadow then it would

6786.719 --> 6790.719
stand out as a shadow in

6788.48 --> 6792.48
in relation to the sunlight right but

6790.719 --> 6793.599
instead you just see the blue from the

6792.48 --> 6797.119
background

6793.599 --> 6799.1990000000005
that's also kind of a hint that is not

6797.119 --> 6807.839999999999
actually a shadow it's just

6799.199 --> 6807.839999999999
a blackened part of the hologram

6827.52 --> 6831.52
who says you can't see the stars through

6832.84 --> 6838.8
them

6834.96 --> 6840.96
i don't know but then again

6838.8 --> 6842.4800000000005
the stars are part of the same

6840.96 --> 6846.159
holographic light

6842.48 --> 6848.0
you know so what are the stars

6846.159 --> 6850.0
if the moon is holographic and the stars

6848.0 --> 6852.56
are holographic how does that work

6850.0 --> 6852.56
how can a

6853.599 --> 6859.4400000000005
the moon just not be visible and then

6856.48 --> 6862.5599999999995
blacken out the sun during an eclipse

6859.44 --> 6865.678999999999
that makes no damn sense at all

6862.56 --> 6869.360000000001
like not even close have you ever tested

6865.679 --> 6870.639
casting light on a ball that is directly

6869.36 --> 6874.839999999999
in front of you

6870.639 --> 6877.679
you're gonna see like the light

6874.84 --> 6881.52
gradually shadowing past it and all that

6877.679 --> 6881.52
you don't see that at all it's just this

6882.0 --> 6889.199
this black disc that's just the missing

6885.52 --> 6889.1990000000005
of light that's moving in front of it

6889.76 --> 6895.4400000000005
almost yeah to me the eclipses sun

6892.159 --> 6895.44
eclipses look more like

6895.599 --> 6899.1990000000005
like there's actually light coming

6897.199 --> 6904.159
through a tunnel and suddenly a big

6899.199 --> 6908.239
boulder is moved in front of the tunnel

6904.159 --> 6908.239
so there can only come light past

6909.28 --> 6912.32
a tiny space and that's what what it

6911.44 --> 6915.839999999999
looks more

6912.32 --> 6915.84
to me like so

6916.159 --> 6922.0
oh what's this freaking firefox crashes

6926.0 --> 6929.599
yeah that's right the moon is not fake

6928.639 --> 6932.88
we can see it

6929.599 --> 6934.159000000001
it's just not a physical object

6932.88 --> 6937.92
but it's there there's a light

6934.159 --> 6937.92
phenomenon absolutely

6939.92 --> 6944.639
right the the visual phenomenon is not

6942.56 --> 6947.84
fake

6944.639 --> 6947.84
it's just not an object

6947.92 --> 6950.159
right

6952.239 --> 6956.0
just because it's not what you wanted it

6955.52 --> 6957.040000000001
to be

6956.0 --> 6958.32
because that's how you've been

6957.04 --> 6960.56
conditioned and you would like to

6958.32 --> 6962.4
reinforce that condition and confirm it

6960.56 --> 6964.159000000001
just because it's not that doesn't mean

6962.4 --> 6966.32
that it's fake

6964.159 --> 6968.0
yeah it's a very nice straw man it is

6966.32 --> 6969.599
not fake it is there it's a light

6968.0 --> 6972.84
phenomenon

6969.599 --> 6975.4400000000005
and that light phenomenon is there oh

6972.84 --> 6977.679
yeah

6975.44 --> 6977.678999999999
ah

6978.56 --> 6982.320000000001
all right thank you mr sensible for the

6980.719 --> 6985.44
two pound super chat donation i

6982.32 --> 6985.44
i do appreciate that

6985.679 --> 6991.28
and yes i i wouldn't see any direct

6988.719 --> 6993.679
reason why i would not politely engage

6991.28 --> 6993.679
with you

6997.28 --> 7001.28
you've been polite with me said a couple

7000.32 --> 7004.5599999999995
of silly things

7001.28 --> 7007.84
but yeah nothing out of the ordinary

7004.56 --> 7010.719
and i was able to respond to it

7007.84 --> 7010.719
so yeah

7012.159 --> 7016.239
yeah glad to have you in chat why not

7014.96 --> 7019.36
it's civil discourse

7016.239 --> 7019.36
that's all fine with me

7019.52 --> 7024.400000000001
but i am gonna round out the show now so

7022.48 --> 7026.0
