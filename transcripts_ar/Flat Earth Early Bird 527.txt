man I was just slow I didn't even watch

127.04 --> 138.5
the show back there's just too many long

129.89 --> 141.55999999999997
pauses very annoying but yeah there was

138.5 --> 145.1
all kinds of issues that I just I could

141.56 --> 147.14000000000001
dig into what I don't wanna so that kind

145.1 --> 149.39
of then effectively just holds me and

147.14 --> 151.94
I'm trying to find something else to

149.39 --> 158.01899999999998
latch on to it if everybody keeps on

151.94 --> 160.97
harping it's tough to do that anyway

158.019 --> 163.85
let's see who is in chat dinosaur Falcon

160.97 --> 168.56
was first acaba misery bear creation

163.85 --> 178.16
bear James Mason Sean Becker they lie

168.56 --> 182.92000000000002
Ohio good to see you all trying to weigh

178.16 --> 182.92
it what what's usually happy what

188.92 --> 193.32
why are you calling creation bear liar

198.45 --> 208.53
[Music]

200.55 --> 208.53
Lu Aqaba I see you in chat

213.06 --> 220.12
[Music]

214.44 --> 221.85999999999999
anyway okay creation bear what did you

220.12 --> 225.84
claim he however seems to have a problem

221.86 --> 225.84
with what you claimed whatever it is

230.98 --> 237.88
I had chat tough chat if he is humble in

235.69 --> 243.01
admitting we have things to learn and

237.88 --> 247.78
things we don't know yet wait is is that

243.01 --> 256.81
the thing you what but that's totally

247.78 --> 260.489
true I think you might have woken up on

256.81 --> 260.489
the wrong side of the bed today he have

262.05 --> 271.21000000000004
alright anyway there was ball busters

266.5 --> 272.979
yesterday and it was life I thought it

271.21 --> 276.60999999999996
wasn't life but it was live after all

272.979 --> 280.51
but I did hear it plenty of advance what

276.61 --> 285.1
was his claim after ok but he did

280.51 --> 286.45
retract that so creation bird-like could

285.1 --> 288.639
you elaborate on that and was that

286.45 --> 292.57
something you thought like no way I

288.639 --> 295.539
don't I don't mean that and that's why

292.57 --> 298.06
you deleted it or like just get this

295.539 --> 300.59999999999997
nonsense out of the way please this is

298.06 --> 300.6
getting annoying

301.71 --> 306.859
alright Priestley

303.66 --> 306.85900000000004
[Music]

308.559 --> 311.21900000000005
yep

319.279 --> 327.949
right okay hobby you're a Glover I

324.259 --> 332.23900000000003
didn't realize that that it was about

327.949 --> 335.229
that no idea but it is kind of true you

332.239 --> 337.93899999999996
know it's not that all glowers do it but

335.229 --> 342.06899999999996
you're constantly working with people

337.939 --> 346.90900000000005
that are prompting everything that are

342.069 --> 349.969
that at least bluff with it and they

346.909 --> 352.129
accept supposed presuppositional based

349.969 --> 354.679
knowledge and assumptions as more

352.129 --> 356.329
knowledge and that's kind of I think the

354.679 --> 365.13899999999995
point what creation bear was trying to

356.329 --> 365.139
make anyway

375.719 --> 383.349
yeah yeah I was the ball busters lasted

380.05 --> 386.229
very very long very long show I thought

383.349 --> 389.8
I did really good I was of course as

386.229 --> 392.409
traditional I was a little drunk but it

389.8 --> 395.289
didn't seem to get in my way this time

392.409 --> 398.71
at all but I guess it's also because I

395.289 --> 401.37899999999996
really was informed like two hours

398.71 --> 405.87899999999996
before that it was gonna happen so I had

401.379 --> 408.279
plenty of time to mentally prepare that

405.879 --> 414.24
was not your point okay whatever let's

408.279 --> 421.599
not get too oversensitive here and yet I

414.24 --> 423.639
don't see yeah I don't see what creation

421.599 --> 428.319
bear said wrong those are things that I

423.639 --> 445.379
could have said I kind of just did in a

428.319 --> 445.379
way it elaborated on it okay right

449.47 --> 452.70000000000005
now thanks red priestly yeah I thought

451.81 --> 457.48
it was pretty good

452.7 --> 459.55
and I thought that I had kind of like

457.48 --> 462.25
started saying like I come on give

459.55 --> 464.44
rhombuses two minutes you know and in a

462.25 --> 469.12
way he got a lot of time and I thought

464.44 --> 471.1
especially QE he I I've been talking

469.12 --> 473.26
with him also like in the back you know

471.1 --> 475.45000000000005
and really trying to tell him like yeah

473.26 --> 478.81
what is this rumpus why is he doing the

475.45 --> 482.92
way he is and that there is kind of felt

478.81 --> 485.89
that there is like this insane honesty

482.92 --> 488.08000000000004
in a way despite all his machinations

485.89 --> 492.66999999999996
because he is just so devoted to the

488.08 --> 493.69
dream it's pretty neurotic and there is

492.67 --> 496.57
value in it

493.69 --> 498.7
like he's a gold mine of comedy just to

496.57 --> 501.42
start out and he's always like trying to

498.7 --> 506.14
frontline the machinations very

501.42 --> 508.27000000000004
relatively effectively like in secret I

506.14 --> 511.289
kind of tried to do that myself as a

508.27 --> 514.06
side hobby and not reveal too much of it

511.289 --> 521.05
but he's also pretty good at it so I

514.06 --> 523.2099999999999
almost feel like ah yeah I think he's

521.05 --> 525.49
fun to have on even though he's always

523.21 --> 527.9200000000001
starts out of course red herring and

525.49 --> 531.28
straw Manning and like but that's just

527.92 --> 535.2099999999999
the way he does things and this time Jon

531.28 --> 536.8299999999999
also kind of appreciate he laughed a lot

535.21 --> 540.07
at it because yeah that's what you

536.83 --> 543.07
should do you know and that doesn't

540.07 --> 546.13
really trigger rumpus at all like yeah

543.07 --> 546.7600000000001
so it was an interesting show lasted

546.13 --> 550.24
very long

546.76 --> 552.64
lots of people spoke up in there but

550.24 --> 555.97
also rumpus got like plenty of times

552.64 --> 560.47
like three times and yeah was good it

555.97 --> 562.24
was refreshing to me that's kind of

560.47 --> 565.6
weird right when rumpus sounds

562.24 --> 567.16
refreshing but yeah it is it is where

565.6 --> 568.96
this I thought it was a great show

567.16 --> 570.87
yesterday on ball busters if you haven't

568.96 --> 575.83
seen it then do check it out over at

570.87 --> 582.72
quantum eraser Channel pseudo is real

575.83 --> 585.769
yeah that's right and more more of those

582.72 --> 585.769
[Music]

585.89 --> 593.28
but I'm pretty sure Nathan's gonna make

588.39 --> 598.14
more snippets clips out of that and

593.28 --> 598.77
we'll get to hear them very concisely it

598.14 --> 602.4
was great

598.77 --> 604.49
I did miss complete yeah I completely

602.4 --> 608.85
miss own Benjamin though because of it

604.49 --> 612.0600000000001
he did play like a a is it a recorded

608.85 --> 613.38
video in the interview with somebody it

612.06 --> 617.2399999999999
was pretty good but it was pretty

613.38 --> 620.01
recorded before that and then during the

617.24 --> 622.2
the ball was to show he started to act

620.01 --> 626.0699999999999
this show with I did like take a look at

622.2 --> 629.2800000000001
it for short woman with his mom again I

626.07 --> 630.9300000000001
have no idea what it was about but I

629.28 --> 632.25
completely missed it unfortunately

630.93 --> 635.18
because well watch this lasted over

632.25 --> 635.18
three hours so

643.71 --> 655.12
taking your morning rumpus right now are

646.78 --> 657.4599999999999
you sure no rumpus in the mornings kind

655.12 --> 664.51
of gives me a headache maybe in the

657.46 --> 668.8000000000001
afternoon you need to be pretty woke up

664.51 --> 671.73
too to handle that [ __ ] because he is

668.8 --> 671.7299999999999
pretty condensed

677.2 --> 684.48
hello Guns of Navarone RFP and Eastham

681.49 --> 684.48
husky could see you

695.49 --> 699.14
I went in time okay

717.39 --> 724.56
hmm right yeah I okay and I wish I could

722.399 --> 728.43
but I don't have a membership over at

724.56 --> 731.01
his website an authorized TV so I can

728.43 --> 735.0889999999999
watch it back I wish I did but it's yeah

731.01 --> 735.5699999999999
it's not hasn't happened don't have the

735.089 --> 747.8100000000001
money

735.57 --> 750.649
sort of D life has to replace now but no

747.81 --> 750.649
it doesn't always work

750.98 --> 758.4300000000001
it doesn't replay for me he did that a

755.22 --> 762.779
few times I think and then now it's just

758.43 --> 766.55
turned off again I don't know why [ __ ]

762.779 --> 766.55
you'd mm-hmm

767.3 --> 772.459
right I could try that perhaps

774.67 --> 784.3499999999999
right by the way what did you guys think

776.92 --> 790.5699999999999
of my is it like my metaphorical

784.35 --> 793.38
analysis of like the biblical text that

790.57 --> 796.63
was it a gem that brought it up I think

793.38 --> 799.33
how to regard basically like the Jesus

796.63 --> 802.48
Christ and the rebirth as like the

799.33 --> 805.72
Spirit of Truth having lost it then gone

802.48 --> 811.54
into lies and then grabbing back for the

805.72 --> 813.64
truth - and then the rebirth and like

811.54 --> 816.37
how to interpret it like that it like

813.64 --> 818.89
that's the thing that have kind of been

816.37 --> 820.96
trying to explain for a long time it's

818.89 --> 822.79
like the multiple angles to reading the

820.96 --> 825.46
Bible you can take it all literal and

822.79 --> 835.5999999999999
but you can also take it as a frequency

825.46 --> 837.88
thing and it kind of okay it kind of can

835.6 --> 839.98
work like in both ways like it could

837.88 --> 843.88
still be literal but at the same time

839.98 --> 847.53
because of its design and purpose and

843.88 --> 851.64
what it is what stands for in the moment

847.53 --> 856.75
you can also just see it as a pattern

851.64 --> 858.85
that kind of is engrained in in creation

856.75 --> 864.88
in all kinds of ways including in your

858.85 --> 866.62
own personal journey it's really simple

864.88 --> 870.28
actually when you think about it like

866.62 --> 874.0
that but yeah it brings up all kinds of

870.28 --> 875.56
conflict with people that yeah that deal

874.0 --> 879.01
with the Bible you know it really

875.56 --> 882.3399999999999
becomes this division in in Bible

879.01 --> 888.39
literalism and this Bible metaphor

882.34 --> 888.39
metaphor ISM metaphorical approach and

889.29 --> 896.9399999999999
to me you know how I think about that

893.23 --> 900.78
that split up there to me that's very

896.94 --> 904.3000000000001
similar to the wave-particle duality

900.78 --> 906.79
false dichotomy concerning light isn't

904.3 --> 908.66
it ironic that it's about light right

906.79 --> 911.3389999999999
light

908.66 --> 913.8
there's a false dichotomy in light in

911.339 --> 916.5290000000001
the nature of light and then there is

913.8 --> 921.18
potentially that's how it feels to me a

916.529 --> 924.06
false dichotomy in the Bible in how to

921.18 --> 928.529
read it in the information in in the

924.06 --> 933.649
light of Christ isn't that it's how it

928.529 --> 937.829
feels to me because I think that it is

933.649 --> 940.889
both real practically it is with the

937.829 --> 943.829
literalness yeah there is much of it

940.889 --> 946.439
that is that is pretty kind of provably

943.829 --> 949.41
literal in historical sense but on the

946.439 --> 952.5889999999999
other hand there so so much that's kind

949.41 --> 956.1
of like complicated and you get into the

952.589 --> 957.5690000000001
physical history of it all and just all

956.1 --> 959.16
the groups and what they've done and

957.569 --> 961.8
then yeah it becomes really

959.16 --> 963.99
mind-boggling concerning the literal

961.8 --> 965.8499999999999
aspect of it and you just realize okay

963.99 --> 968.55
there's fair this is likelihood of

965.85 --> 971.339
maneuvering key things kept out little

968.55 --> 978.029
details changed for political reasons or

971.339 --> 981.149
for language reasons you know and then

978.029 --> 984.3
when you think about that and you switch

981.149 --> 987.529
back to the metaphorical spiritual

984.3 --> 993.209
approach of reading it then you notice I

987.529 --> 995.1
notice which things are likely left out

993.209 --> 997.5889999999999
because then there is something missing

995.1 --> 999.0600000000001
in the spectrum of the frequency when

997.589 --> 1000.5600000000001
there's something added in that's kind

999.06 --> 1003.199
of out of place or when something is

1000.56 --> 1005.5089999999999
kind of changed there's like a frequency

1003.199 --> 1008.2299999999999
rotation in spot but it's still yeah you

1005.509 --> 1011.269
can unrotated and then it matches and

1008.23 --> 1015.8290000000001
then it can spiritually back engineer

1011.269 --> 1018.11
almost intuitively how things sort of

1015.829 --> 1022.04
have been changed and recognized that

1018.11 --> 1024.949
the original essence of how it came into

1022.04 --> 1030.1399999999999
the world how it was inspired onto the

1024.949 --> 1033.919
the people onto the - Jesus's followers

1030.14 --> 1036.6200000000001
what is the apostle's how the original

1033.919 --> 1038.689
vision of it all the frequency the

1036.62 --> 1039.559
essence of what it means that the

1038.689 --> 1042.6200000000001
message

1039.559 --> 1045.9189999999999
from God how that was arrived in its

1042.62 --> 1048.0189999999998
purity and then over time it was put to

1045.919 --> 1050.3600000000001
paper it was thought about it was

1048.019 --> 1053.24
considered it was chisel to make it more

1050.36 --> 1055.49
unique recognizable form and then the

1053.24 --> 1058.22
powers did all kinds of things that

1055.49 --> 1062.809
represent purposes they're changed and

1058.22 --> 1066.6490000000001
it became part of the exoteric world as

1062.809 --> 1070.49
it were but in all the replications of

1066.649 --> 1072.9189999999999
the original vision the essence is still

1070.49 --> 1075.95
there because because and this is an

1072.919 --> 1078.8890000000001
important one because if it is changed

1075.95 --> 1082.6390000000001
too much for religion like break

1078.889 --> 1085.61
something too harshly about the whole

1082.639 --> 1088.7299999999998
strike the whole meaning of it then it

1085.61 --> 1094.309
buckles the essence of the original

1088.73 --> 1102.46
essence it buckles and people lose their

1094.309 --> 1102.46
momentum in the ascension energy yeah

1105.279 --> 1110.99
can't believe I just can't get it out

1107.749 --> 1116.119
there in its entirety but that's that's

1110.99 --> 1117.95
what I think about it so I guess in that

1116.119 --> 1120.9189999999999
sense I am not so much a viable

1117.95 --> 1124.999
literalist but I do recognize that there

1120.919 --> 1126.8300000000002
that there's a big puzzle about it and I

1124.999 --> 1132.8890000000001
yeah it is

1126.83 --> 1136.58
I personally don't say no that's

1132.889 --> 1139.789
nonsense that's a distraction that's the

1136.58 --> 1142.84
evil trying to trick or maybe it is or

1139.789 --> 1146.2
maybe that's just the human response

1142.84 --> 1149.6899999999998
inside to do that and then leave this

1146.2 --> 1151.789
pattern behind research writings the

1149.69 --> 1154.8500000000001
ideas and then other people follow in

1151.789 --> 1156.879
this road so it just naturally shapes

1154.85 --> 1160.6
like that

1156.879 --> 1163.6999999999998
so literalism the exoteric

1160.6 --> 1167.33
interpretation and care for that is a

1163.7 --> 1170.179
natural response to dealing with such as

1167.33 --> 1170.58
essence for people with egos and that

1170.179 --> 1173.97
have

1170.58 --> 1176.07
need to make things literal also but it

1173.97 --> 1181.559
doesn't even mean necessarily that it

1176.07 --> 1184.46
isn't it's just something that should be

1181.559 --> 1190.1399999999999
kept in mind that that happens over time

1184.46 --> 1193.309
it's the people when it comes to big

1190.14 --> 1196.8600000000001
things big consciousness heavy things

1193.309 --> 1200.039
they protect themselves by interpreting

1196.86 --> 1201.809
some of these essences usually not

1200.039 --> 1203.97
understanding them to start out with

1201.809 --> 1206.0
because they can't wield it and then

1203.97 --> 1209.6390000000001
they bring out an exoteric

1206.0 --> 1212.73
interpretation to interpret it not as

1209.639 --> 1215.76
meant to be but slightly more

1212.73 --> 1220.23
superficial to kind of ikana fie the

1215.76 --> 1222.5
effect to remember what it was without

1220.23 --> 1225.029
necessarily really understanding the

1222.5 --> 1227.34
true essence of it and then you can

1225.029 --> 1229.59
evade from the true essence and that is

1227.34 --> 1233.01
really what spawns the need for not

1229.59 --> 1235.26
understanding it properly and the exit

1233.01 --> 1237.389
terrorism and the exit terrorism then

1235.26 --> 1239.07
starts building around it it becomes

1237.389 --> 1242.12
your shield from the understanding

1239.07 --> 1246.539
because now you have your essence

1242.12 --> 1251.059
interpretation based yeah on what you

1246.539 --> 1256.649
did in response to yeah having touched

1251.059 --> 1262.62
certain insights it is all about

1256.649 --> 1265.83
ignorance really and the inability to

1262.62 --> 1268.7399999999998
wield certain insights it's about not

1265.83 --> 1273.389
being able to handle the truth I think

1268.74 --> 1275.94
that is like the biggest or probably one

1273.389 --> 1280.019
of the most critical elements in the

1275.94 --> 1284.3400000000001
very purpose of us being here in

1280.019 --> 1289.08
creation it's like the it's basically

1284.34 --> 1292.1999999999998
God like reminding us hey things are

1289.08 --> 1295.529
going amazing in the world really they

1292.2 --> 1297.96
are so much that people basically have

1295.529 --> 1300.51
fabricated massive amounts of illusions

1297.96 --> 1303.8700000000001
because people can't effectively handle

1300.51 --> 1304.29
how great things are their ego can't

1303.87 --> 1312.27
handle

1304.29 --> 1315.12
and so they step away and this has

1312.27 --> 1318.12
become almost like a plague it's like

1315.12 --> 1322.56
gods like reminding us not like now you

1318.12 --> 1325.02
cannot be like me in the physical world

1322.56 --> 1327.27
because you have the other side to

1325.02 --> 1334.95
balance it out you afte go and it won't

1327.27 --> 1338.43
allow you not not just like that

1334.95 --> 1340.65
not without walking the staircase and

1338.43 --> 1346.97
going through the trials it just can't

1340.65 --> 1346.97
happen essentially yes of things

1349.76 --> 1357.89
no trial not triad and you yeah whatever

1354.48 --> 1357.89
you were talking about something else

1363.01 --> 1377.51
whatever Stallion talking about the

1371.0 --> 1379.88
essence here and look I've even I'm

1377.51 --> 1382.97
already grafting I'm in my mind I'm

1379.88 --> 1388.94
drafting I can't help it in the sense

1382.97 --> 1393.2
that I'm trying to figure out what all

1388.94 --> 1396.1100000000001
the deities are for real like what

1393.2 --> 1399.289
they're assigned contracts of creation

1396.11 --> 1401.6899999999998
are what they're wider meaning is what

1399.289 --> 1404.03
the politicization between religions

1401.69 --> 1407.72
have been and what the world likely is

1404.03 --> 1410.1789999999999
with supposed deities whether they are

1407.72 --> 1412.25
in the spiritual realm only or whether

1410.179 --> 1415.73
there is some kind of physical entity

1412.25 --> 1418.64
somewhere and spiritual and I'm I'm

1415.73 --> 1422.179
trying to basically puzzle together a a

1418.64 --> 1424.22
true multi-dimensional cosmology here in

1422.179 --> 1427.24
my mind I have been for some time and

1424.22 --> 1435.26
figuring out even like how the Pantheon

1427.24 --> 1439.07
is there in some way with with the yeah

1435.26 --> 1442.46
with the creator himself in however he

1439.07 --> 1446.539
manifests in reflection to them wherever

1442.46 --> 1451.7
and however they are like the idea of

1446.539 --> 1456.35
fallen angels it's like it's all from

1451.7 --> 1459.3500000000001
the perspective of that one God and that

1456.35 --> 1462.11
may be literally true like that but at

1459.35 --> 1464.3899999999999
the same time just looking at it from

1462.11 --> 1471.77
the things from a consequence

1464.39 --> 1477.409
perspective and like just things like

1471.77 --> 1481.4
built or inevitable flaws within

1477.409 --> 1483.44
separated creations and technically an

1481.4 --> 1485.48
Alpha and Omega that encompasses all

1483.44 --> 1488.0
thing and the design itself if there are

1485.48 --> 1490.82
some beings that for some reason have

1488.0 --> 1493.64
separately manifested in the realm as

1490.82 --> 1494.37
separate with separate entities then

1493.64 --> 1497.0700000000002
they have

1494.37 --> 1500.6999999999998
and thereby have floss and then when

1497.07 --> 1503.61
they have incredible power yeah it's

1500.7 --> 1506.19
like the same lesson that we're slowly

1503.61 --> 1508.1399999999999
learning all of us as humans but it's

1506.19 --> 1512.16
slow that's why I said it and I think

1508.14 --> 1514.6200000000001
that these supposed gods of whether they

1512.16 --> 1518.91
are absolutely real out there or have a

1514.62 --> 1523.6999999999998
key core function somehow they either

1518.91 --> 1526.95
just had they just got this power and

1523.7 --> 1528.54
they're by the contract that comes with

1526.95 --> 1534.72
it and they were basically bound by the

1528.54 --> 1536.7
power that was given to them or is there

1534.72 --> 1539.1000000000001
another aura it's like how did they

1536.7 --> 1540.75
attain it but yeah as soon as they

1539.1 --> 1542.1899999999998
separate and wield that power then

1540.75 --> 1546.0
they're going to be bound by how their

1542.19 --> 1548.54
ego functions and these kinds of things

1546.0 --> 1552.2
are even described in the mythologies oh

1548.54 --> 1556.23
yeah it may be the Greek mythology's and

1552.2 --> 1559.4
also in yeah the stories of the Germanic

1556.23 --> 1563.7
Pantheon and all that Nordic Pantheon

1559.4 --> 1572.91
they are all they all have egos and they

1563.7 --> 1574.89
those egos determine everything do you

1572.91 --> 1579.78
understand they determine everything

1574.89 --> 1585.15
about it because the power takes away

1579.78 --> 1587.67
all the the earthly routines and thereby

1585.15 --> 1592.8600000000001
the purpose so the ego then is the only

1587.67 --> 1595.41
thing left see there's a there's a huge

1592.86 --> 1600.24
lesson hidden in just the essence of

1595.41 --> 1602.309
things and power and ego in that in all

1600.24 --> 1607.22
of that it's it's hidden in plain sight

1602.309 --> 1607.22
for anyone to recognize hopefully

1608.059 --> 1613.47
because it is creation if if there is a

1611.28 --> 1618.5
pantheon then they are part of creation

1613.47 --> 1618.5
because they are they exist

1622.8 --> 1628.1499999999999
however you regard them and whether they

1625.66 --> 1630.5500000000002
are alive or in another frequency

1628.15 --> 1638.3500000000001
another dimension however you want to

1630.55 --> 1640.9289999999999
see that I don't know for sure I've been

1638.35 --> 1644.1699999999998
in my visions I've been confronted with

1640.929 --> 1650.5590000000002
at least imagery of what were said to me

1644.17 --> 1655.63
were like deities but you know in in the

1650.559 --> 1657.3999999999999
in my idea with my sensitivity in any

1655.63 --> 1660.19
cases no matter what I was going through

1657.4 --> 1662.77
even with the naivety I was wielding the

1660.19 --> 1666.13
flame of honour inside and if true deity

1662.77 --> 1668.8
would absolutely give me in my

1666.13 --> 1672.8700000000001
imagination at least you know from from

1668.8 --> 1676.69
even better way back then would just be

1672.87 --> 1679.78
unmistakable so in that regard I don't

1676.69 --> 1683.8600000000001
think I've ever met like a deity I have

1679.78 --> 1688.1499999999999
met beings that were like we had a lot

1683.86 --> 1690.25
of energy and some that seemed not human

1688.15 --> 1694.3000000000002
but not hostile like the all kinds of

1690.25 --> 1697.95
things over there but never something

1694.3 --> 1697.95
that I would consider a deity

1701.149 --> 1705.889
not as as from the legends

1711.33 --> 1717.21
[Music]

1720.309 --> 1729.6499999999999
then again in the very essence of

1723.41 --> 1733.28
creation that that the the creation and

1729.65 --> 1735.8600000000001
what it means and the yeah the frequency

1733.28 --> 1739.82
their often just the implication that

1735.86 --> 1750.1699999999998
was apparent to me even during the dark

1739.82 --> 1752.45
world situation so on the other side the

1750.17 --> 1775.0700000000002
best I can hope for is to be smacked by

1752.45 --> 1778.4
the holy spirit all right right anyway

1775.07 --> 1780.35
so that was kind of my my spiritual talk

1778.4 --> 1783.73
for a moment did you see the chair move

1780.35 --> 1783.73
me I know and no I did not

1784.66 --> 1790.25
did it like by its own volition and

1789.05 --> 1793.3899999999999
weird stuff going on

1790.25 --> 1793.39
[Music]

1798.33 --> 1801.1399999999999
hmm

1802.31 --> 1808.0
okay that is weird not when was that

1814.809 --> 1817.44
Tom

1820.29 --> 1825.3899999999999
okay well technically you know with what

1823.14 --> 1829.76
he does I wouldn't be a few minutes ago

1825.39 --> 1829.76
what what are you talking about

1841.18 --> 1850.03
a few minutes ago what with what Owen

1847.95 --> 1857.68
talking about Owen Benjamin he's not

1850.03 --> 1864.82
live my chair moved behind me no it

1857.68 --> 1874.18
didn't no I think you saw the door move

1864.82 --> 1878.6799999999998
probably and I didn't hear it move

1874.18 --> 1891.3700000000001
[ __ ] no see it's the warping so that

1878.68 --> 1894.52
Boop no I'll watch it back later but I'm

1891.37 --> 1897.9399999999998
not no I'm not buying it right yeah and

1894.52 --> 1900.52
if things move it's gonna be that

1897.94 --> 1906.4
freaking weird little closet that I've

1900.52 --> 1910.15
had for a long time over 25 years that

1906.4 --> 1911.98
thing is weird and it's it makes a lot

1910.15 --> 1917.1100000000001
of sounds at now it's like there's

1911.98 --> 1918.76
there's like a whole family of ghosts

1917.11 --> 1921.4299999999998
living in there sometimes because it

1918.76 --> 1922.33
makes so much sound like out of nothing

1921.43 --> 1925.78
in the middle of the night you should

1922.33 --> 1928.96
creep oh do you keep like what are they

1925.78 --> 1932.19
doing that's like there's construction

1928.96 --> 1932.19
work going in there

1941.65 --> 1945.45
I'm sorry bear asserted now

1955.85 --> 1959.09
no way

1969.31 --> 1972.51
[Music]

1973.34 --> 1979.139
now I think it's probably because the

1976.08 --> 1982.139
camera got warped I'd know when it got

1979.139 --> 1984.029
shake and then just suddenly it's it

1982.139 --> 1984.629
started yeah here now does it again did

1984.029 --> 1987.779
you see that

1984.629 --> 1990.269
zoom or this way this isn't like that

1987.779 --> 1992.789
but it's only like this side of the

1990.269 --> 1997.999
screen just goes whoop

1992.789 --> 1997.999
it was weird I think that's what you saw

2004.73 --> 2007.78
oh okay

2010.21 --> 2016.21
oh so you were talk Todd different

2014.11 --> 2017.9499999999998
narratives yeah you were talking about

2016.21 --> 2019.33
Owen Benjamin somebody else was talking

2017.95 --> 2021.929
about the chair behind me but that's

2019.33 --> 2021.9289999999999
just nonsense

2026.07 --> 2032.019
right mystery but I didn't pick up on

2028.419 --> 2035.47
that but I didn't see the whole thing I

2032.019 --> 2040.48
came a little late with that stream it

2035.47 --> 2043.529
was really cool though right right right

2040.48 --> 2043.529
yeah yeah I got that

2049.889 --> 2055.599
that chair behind me oh that's pretty

2052.24 --> 2062.3089999999997
old I think I got it from a secondhand

2055.599 --> 2070.4190000000003
store with my ex back in the day in 2010

2062.309 --> 2072.849
yeah really early on that's in 2011 I

2070.419 --> 2080.3489999999997
didn't remember but yeah I don't know

2072.849 --> 2081.4190000000003
how old it is it's a really oversized

2080.349 --> 2084.039
chair for me

2081.419 --> 2086.999
but I just like it I think it's an

2084.039 --> 2086.9990000000003
awesome looking chair

2092.429 --> 2097.65
I think it would be a proper chair for

2095.339 --> 2100.589
Big Bear although I don't think it's

2097.65 --> 2107.13
he'd appreciate the style or maybe he

2100.589 --> 2117.75
would I don't know seems to be from the

2107.13 --> 2126.3
1930s yeah little yeah where it is it's

2117.75 --> 2129.63
leather yeah and I got a couch that is

2126.3 --> 2132.809
very similar but it's in my storage she

2129.63 --> 2135.21
doesn't fit in here and fortunately it's

2132.809 --> 2137.75
like a one and a half sized couch to

2135.21 --> 2137.75
couch couch

2160.7 --> 2168.2
that chair yeah it's it is kind of heavy

2165.53 --> 2172.119
not super happy though there's no metal

2168.2 --> 2172.1189999999997
in it but wood

2216.53 --> 2222.36
hey NASA I don't know how old it is

2220.26 --> 2225.03
it's it I'm pretty sure it's a replica

2222.36 --> 2227.28
it's not some super antique chair I'm

2225.03 --> 2231.26
pretty damn sure about it because just

2227.28 --> 2231.26
the quality of the leather is too good

2235.85 --> 2247.14
and the wood on it is not that special -

2241.22 --> 2249.75
I just like the chair it's a really

2247.14 --> 2255.35
great chair to sit in there and binge

2249.75 --> 2255.35
watch stuff just chilling there

2270.11 --> 2278.02
right it's a chair I know it's a chair

2273.98 --> 2284.36
that's a chair it's a chair it's a chair

2278.02 --> 2289.97
right so anything in particular you guys

2284.36 --> 2291.82
want to talk about on this Sunday it's a

2289.97 --> 2296.39
good look

2291.82 --> 2298.82
it's globert chair letters jets it's a

2296.39 --> 2301.91
chair Ares it doesn't have an opinion

2298.82 --> 2310.13
about the geometrical orientation of the

2301.91 --> 2313.25
earth and yeah it has both both flat

2310.13 --> 2315.44
surfaces and curves so I think it's

2313.25 --> 2318.57
pretty neutral about it

2315.44 --> 2318.57
[Music]

2328.38 --> 2335.069
hmm that's a good one II haven't talked

2332.19 --> 2338.2490000000003
about UFOs what's there to talk about

2335.069 --> 2339.39
I don't see them I've never really seen

2338.249 --> 2343.1699999999996
they're something that I could

2339.39 --> 2346.019
definitely say is a UFO but I have seen

2343.17 --> 2355.92
like odd celestial phenomena like the

2346.019 --> 2359.089
weird falling up stars it is that but is

2355.92 --> 2363.66
that flying if it's just a straight line

2359.089 --> 2365.43
thing I don't know seems more like a

2363.66 --> 2368.249
projectile or something in that

2365.43 --> 2370.5589999999997
direction but now I've never really seen

2368.249 --> 2372.359
anything that I could say like um well

2370.559 --> 2374.779
that's there's no way that that's like

2372.359 --> 2378.21
some kind of plane or a typical

2374.779 --> 2382.289
like a celestial satellite you know one

2378.21 --> 2384.739
of those because they happen to I've

2382.289 --> 2384.739
seen those

2392.84 --> 2401.76
u.s. Navy disclosure videos no don't

2397.5 --> 2404.94
know what that is but let the US has

2401.76 --> 2407.9
been disclosing a lot of like UFO

2404.94 --> 2411.15
encounters with planes and stuff and

2407.9 --> 2414.27
military so that's been going on for

2411.15 --> 2416.9300000000003
decades and it's I guess they're gaining

2414.27 --> 2420.12
more momentum they're gaining more

2416.93 --> 2423.48
they're being more upfront with it and

2420.12 --> 2429.12
and aliens and dissecting a there's all

2423.48 --> 2430.83
kinds of stuff just but that's those are

2429.12 --> 2434.7799999999997
projects that have been going for at

2430.83 --> 2434.7799999999997
least twenty years probably much longer

2459.31 --> 2467.02
right the lockdown all right that still

2462.4 --> 2471.13
going on and I'm seeing a couple of

2467.02 --> 2479.8
people like going into protest with that

2471.13 --> 2483.4
like I actually seen a lot was it a red

2479.8 --> 2486.5800000000004
bell philosophy was getting into that

2483.4 --> 2490.2400000000002
and wasn't it yeah Jason disparate

2486.58 --> 2493.48
family is completely onto that wise

2490.24 --> 2496.1699999999996
typically down their lane I think but

2493.48 --> 2503.2
yeah they're doing something right now

2496.17 --> 2505.78
yesterday also oh wait no it's already

2503.2 --> 2509.8599999999997
yeah they streamed it life like one and

2505.78 --> 2512.88
a half hours ago so they're onto the

2509.86 --> 2515.4700000000003
yeah open backup type of protest and

2512.88 --> 2521.65
yeah lots of people are onto that right

2515.47 --> 2526.87
now in a way I would be if if things

2521.65 --> 2529.27
would have been as bad here but yeah as

2526.87 --> 2532.5099999999998
far as I can tell most things are kind

2529.27 --> 2535.3
of open again I've even seen like just

2532.51 --> 2539.0200000000004
things like barber shops and stuff are

2535.3 --> 2542.77
back open so it seems I think some cafes

2539.02 --> 2544.81
are even back open over here it's not

2542.77 --> 2547.42
everything it's not just like all back

2544.81 --> 2551.65
to normal but they're like slowly

2547.42 --> 2554.16
building it completely away because most

2551.65 --> 2557.2000000000003
people were kind of done with it

2554.16 --> 2558.6099999999997
everybody here I think that almost

2557.2 --> 2561.6699999999996
everybody thinks it is kind of

2558.61 --> 2563.17
nonsensical but like the response you

2561.67 --> 2565.3
know they may be preoccupied in

2563.17 --> 2568.03
frightful about Corona but at the same

2565.3 --> 2570.52
time they know that this supposed

2568.03 --> 2577.98
lockdown is effectively not really

2570.52 --> 2577.98
helping so

2578.829 --> 2584.0600000000004
although like the idea of social

2582.17 --> 2589.4
distancing has been kind of like

2584.06 --> 2592.5499999999997
integrated had that one got in very

2589.4 --> 2596.119
easily but then again most people don't

2592.55 --> 2598.9700000000003
really take that that series like in a

2596.119 --> 2601.9300000000003
panicky way they just now keep the

2598.97 --> 2601.93
natural distance

2615.65 --> 2621.92
right so I think that some time ago

2619.55 --> 2624.02
Owen Benjamin also addressed this how

2621.92 --> 2626.3
that's how that's gonna work and others

2624.02 --> 2629.03
also by the way even remember the old

2626.3 --> 2634.4900000000002
Benjamin version basically explaining

2629.03 --> 2636.9500000000003
that yeah that's it was always gonna

2634.49 --> 2639.2
open up eventually but it's not about it

2636.95 --> 2641.39
closing down an opening back up no it's

2639.2 --> 2646.52
about the changes that were made while

2641.39 --> 2648.17
that happened and that it's made that

2646.52 --> 2650.6
there's like outrageous things being

2648.17 --> 2653.36
attempted that we then protest again so

2650.6 --> 2657.71
we overlook the mind the minor details

2653.36 --> 2660.98
that are slipped in and kept in place or

2657.71 --> 2663.58
at least tried to it just slips in it's

2660.98 --> 2667.91
like a cultural accidental shift

2663.58 --> 2670.4
adaptation and it should yeah completely

2667.91 --> 2673.85
be undone but that in Prak in practice

2670.4 --> 2675.77
doesn't really happen unless everybody's

2673.85 --> 2680.27
really fanatical about getting it out

2675.77 --> 2682.88
and so yeah they're dis social

2680.27 --> 2685.85
distancing now is very likely to kind of

2682.88 --> 2689.33
echo on it might not be taken like very

2685.85 --> 2693.89
dangerously serious but it's still just

2689.33 --> 2697.97
gonna be a a thing that's around now and

2693.89 --> 2701.99
that people will kind of do that and buy

2697.97 --> 2705.1899999999996
it yeah that is what has changed

2701.99 --> 2705.1899999999996
[Music]

2724.93 --> 2729.0899999999997
all right Marko bags yeah

2740.56 --> 2750.0499999999997
yeah I have to say miss you sort of

2743.54 --> 2756.08
Marco box but I do miss it sometimes you

2750.05 --> 2757.79
know it was like Amsterdam conference

2756.08 --> 2759.89
being around a lot of people that was

2757.79 --> 2762.2
that was really great I really liked

2759.89 --> 2769.97
that I did enjoy that I thrived in that

2762.2 --> 2774.9199999999996
for the time being but in general yeah

2769.97 --> 2778.6699999999996
I'm very much on my own as well so I've

2774.92 --> 2780.859
barely noticed it except for the silly

2778.67 --> 2784.4
circus works yeah you're now supposed to

2780.859 --> 2786.97
be doing at stores and all that and the

2784.4 --> 2786.9700000000003
waiting rose

2800.64 --> 2807.2999999999997
when

2802.56 --> 2807.2999999999997
okay Guns of Navarone RMP

2809.94 --> 2813.13
[Music]

2816.54 --> 2819.739
[Music]

2820.8 --> 2830.7200000000003
they did anybody I don't know check it

2825.45 --> 2833.3689999999997
out with like infrared scope perhaps or

2830.72 --> 2836.9399999999996
because if that's just these visuals and

2833.369 --> 2839.28
lights at this point I could conceive

2836.94 --> 2843.78
that that might potentially be just pure

2839.28 --> 2845.61
holographics advanced holographics and I

2843.78 --> 2848.1600000000003
think that things like infrared vision

2845.61 --> 2850.84
would reveal whether it is that or a

2848.16 --> 2854.109
real thing up there

2850.84 --> 2854.109
[Music]

2865.27 --> 2874.72
all right yeah

2872.25 --> 2878.44
that would be awesome thing to have by

2874.72 --> 2881.7999999999997
the way like a really good visual scope

2878.44 --> 2884.83
thing where I could almost like the

2881.8 --> 2886.9900000000002
helmet from predator just switch like

2884.83 --> 2892.24
the the type of scanning in the visual

2886.99 --> 2894.22
this is a dove and just yeah figure very

2892.24 --> 2897.49
quickly be able to figure out what

2894.22 --> 2904.24
something is on the spot there will be

2897.49 --> 2907.24
such a great thing to have it's probably

2904.24 --> 2907.66
expensive though I bet there are things

2907.24 --> 2910.7189999999996
like that

2907.66 --> 2910.719
[Music]

2918.81 --> 2925.65
[Music]

2921.48 --> 2928.41
what I was still working for government

2925.65 --> 2932.2400000000002
people were phoning it but oh people

2928.41 --> 2934.6499999999996
were just hand waved away oh dear

2932.24 --> 2937.02
yeah well what's government gonna do

2934.65 --> 2941.4300000000003
about it you know remember it's like the

2937.02 --> 2943.2599999999998
government in some city they're not like

2941.43 --> 2945.5899999999997
the controllers they don't know that

2943.26 --> 2950.01
they don't have some geopolitical

2945.59 --> 2954.06
oversight of like or even any kind of

2950.01 --> 2955.44
way to deal with aliens or UFOs or so of

2954.06 --> 2956.82
course they're just gonna hand you if

2955.44 --> 2959.79
it's like what are they gonna do did

2956.82 --> 2963.59
people get like zapped away or whatever

2959.79 --> 2963.59
yeah then they might get involved

2966.12 --> 2969.25
[Music]

2980.059 --> 2982.779

3023.43 --> 3029.48
No

3026.33 --> 3031.7
look plot the harder dude you seem to

3029.48 --> 3034.79
have a little bit of an issue here and

3031.7 --> 3037.8199999999997
there you also you posted something

3034.79 --> 3039.86
yesterday in my chat that I don't or

3037.82 --> 3041.96
like in the comment section that I don't

3039.86 --> 3044.7400000000002
want to be posted nothing to it just

3041.96 --> 3044.7400000000002
yeah

3045.82 --> 3052.79
so and yeah you're saying like oh

3050.99 --> 3054.62
because we didn't take action the New

3052.79 --> 3056.9
World Order is gonna win you don't seem

3054.62 --> 3063.1
to understand really how things work

3056.9 --> 3065.9300000000003
like how the game really works because

3063.1 --> 3067.96
this thing has been going on for a long

3065.93 --> 3067.96
time

3068.32 --> 3076.15
right but you freedom of speech yeah

3071.66 --> 3078.83
well you have it right you do have it

3076.15 --> 3085.15
despite everything that you're doing and

3078.83 --> 3088.8199999999997
yeah what you're pushing so you got a

3085.15 --> 3091.61
compartmentalize what is being said what

3088.82 --> 3094.07
you think and then just get really

3091.61 --> 3098.02
honest with now and see what is really

3094.07 --> 3102.2000000000003
going on and where you are being drawn

3098.02 --> 3106.5099999999998
forward by presuppositional ideas that

3102.2 --> 3106.5099999999998
you just really like or can't let go of

3107.29 --> 3113.5099999999998
you got to be honest about what you

3109.52 --> 3115.79
really have confirmation of and just

3113.51 --> 3123.8900000000003
things like a news article these days is

3115.79 --> 3126.41
not confirmation anymore not just that

3123.89 --> 3130.299
because there is just more blatant

3126.41 --> 3134.45
misinformation in between there as well

3130.299 --> 3136.46
yeah that's very nice Georgia

3134.45 --> 3139.1189999999997
Guidestones yeah and Bill Gates and yeah

3136.46 --> 3143.839
it's all yeah that's right

3139.119 --> 3147.4700000000003
so how are they gonna do it actually do

3143.839 --> 3153.019
it like really do it can they do that is

3147.47 --> 3155.1699999999996
that viable what what do you think you

3153.019 --> 3155.1699999999996
know

3163.46 --> 3169.0
I will never fool with your Scientology

3166.73 --> 3169.0
what

3172.75 --> 3185.8
what are you talking about you're

3175.87 --> 3192.58
getting a bit Sivan yay now now you just

3185.8 --> 3198.82
got to think about what is oh I think I

3192.58 --> 3200.7999999999997
know this is there's only a few people I

3198.82 --> 3201.61
know in the Netherlands that say things

3200.8 --> 3206.7000000000003
like that

3201.61 --> 3206.7000000000003
specifically right

3218.85 --> 3225.5099999999998
so anyway this whole idea of oh you're

3222.46 --> 3228.85
all gonna be forced vaccine and blah and

3225.51 --> 3231.4900000000002
yeah just just stay at home and

3228.85 --> 3233.3199999999997
basically die or believe that these

3231.49 --> 3235.54
things that off is done it obviously

3233.32 --> 3236.17
don't help will help and like that's the

3235.54 --> 3238.66
end of it

3236.17 --> 3242.6800000000003
well you gotta take into account it in

3238.66 --> 3244.6
how much people will by how much they

3242.68 --> 3246.49
appear to buy and how much they're just

3244.6 --> 3248.68
acting like they're buying and how many

3246.49 --> 3251.3199999999997
people are just blatantly not going

3248.68 --> 3253.2999999999997
along with it anyway and I realized like

3251.32 --> 3256.2400000000002
okay if they're gonna make such a move

3253.3 --> 3257.82
how are they gonna do it how could they

3256.24 --> 3261.43
get away with that

3257.82 --> 3263.8900000000003
like effectively get away not legally

3261.43 --> 3266.08
like legally they could do whatever they

3263.89 --> 3268.69
like basically but it's about getting

3266.08 --> 3272.98
away with it in the face of the public

3268.69 --> 3276.37
so how do they do that because if they

3272.98 --> 3280.36
go too far it's over it's that's always

3276.37 --> 3283.18
been the case so you gotta think about

3280.36 --> 3286.42
it more carefully instead of just saying

3283.18 --> 3289.3599999999997
yeah we're going to hell it's so extreme

3286.42 --> 3293.29
because any story anybody could say is

3289.36 --> 3296.35
out there just make it insanely sick as

3293.29 --> 3298.93
possible and make it as untenable and

3296.35 --> 3301.0899999999997
hopeless as possible so I just don't

3298.93 --> 3303.3399999999997
have any control over it have an excuse

3301.09 --> 3306.2200000000003
as to why I shouldn't even try to get

3303.34 --> 3308.3500000000004
control over it and just keep imagining

3306.22 --> 3310.6
like the world is crashing down around

3308.35 --> 3315.39
me well that's not going to be very

3310.6 --> 3318.87
effective to do anything useful with

3315.39 --> 3318.87
that kind of mindset

3325.89 --> 3329.489
[Music]

3332.38 --> 3341.27
no it's not true there is plenty of

3337.34 --> 3343.8500000000004
people they are going out right now that

3341.27 --> 3346.0099999999998
are walking around driving around like

3343.85 --> 3347.9
even when it's freaking raining I still

3346.01 --> 3349.76
see people walking outside and I see

3347.9 --> 3352.34
people like jogging and [ __ ] all the

3349.76 --> 3357.3500000000004
time letting people letting out their

3352.34 --> 3360.8
dogs oh this just no I don't know how

3357.35 --> 3363.17
it's like where you're at Plaza harder

3360.8 --> 3364.21
but over here it's really not like that

3363.17 --> 3367.94
at all

3364.21 --> 3369.95
ninety-five percent know there may be

3367.94 --> 3371.96
people staying inside but those people

3369.95 --> 3375.3799999999997
would be staying inside either way

3371.96 --> 3378.65
because they're like uni yeah they're

3375.38 --> 3380.33
squirty's they're they're squids so they

3378.65 --> 3382.2200000000003
would have stayed inside even without

3380.33 --> 3385.75
this story of who you have to stay

3382.22 --> 3385.75
inside no that's what they do

3394.58 --> 3397.58
okay

3399.43 --> 3406.74
dude you're spiraling man and your cap

3403.089 --> 3406.74
Singh don't appreciate that at all

3410.27 --> 3413.389
[Music]

3434.49 --> 3437.49
okay

3438.88 --> 3446.85
now that's I totally agree I totally

3443.02 --> 3446.85
agree and that's why I don't do that

3448.86 --> 3456.4900000000002
overall I think sort of metaphor like

3453.79 --> 3459.09
sort of hinted at it to a few people a

3456.49 --> 3462.37
couple of times when they just really go

3459.09 --> 3464.23
so far out of line then yeah I do that

3462.37 --> 3466.44
it's kind of weird that you bring that

3464.23 --> 3469.6
up now it sounds very familiar again

3466.44 --> 3472.15
because I it's weird I almost forgot

3469.6 --> 3475.9
your name but I think I know who you are

3472.15 --> 3478.09
because this is exactly how that guy

3475.9 --> 3480.19
talked that was on my show a couple of

3478.09 --> 3482.3500000000004
times and then got banned because he got

3480.19 --> 3487.81
all maniacal and unapologetic and

3482.35 --> 3493.7799999999997
demonic and like Christian zealous in a

3487.81 --> 3499.44
very insane deaf and blind way so yeah

3493.78 --> 3499.44
it's you isn't it his name again

3516.91 --> 3522.41
but anyway I I don't really want you in

3519.92 --> 3525.76
here especially when you start to drag

3522.41 --> 3530.5
in that kind of disgusting [ __ ] you know

3525.76 --> 3530.5
keep keep the darkness to yourself

3538.89 --> 3547.5
I already went over the line in my in my

3541.859 --> 3550.0989999999997
comment section and this is yeah that's

3547.5 --> 3550.099
enough now

3557.67 --> 3560.7490000000003
[Music]

3563.78 --> 3566.44
what

3574.79 --> 3586.4
that's interesting Zuri bear so was a

3582.8 --> 3588.79
tidy ghost it it put the chair back in

3586.4 --> 3588.79
place

3607.12 --> 3612.83
this show was everywhere on the map

3610.01 --> 3615.82
today well the show is not over yet Guns

3612.83 --> 3615.8199999999997
of Navarone R&B

3632.46 --> 3642.03
I could go straight no no Missouri bear

3635.099 --> 3644.339
they don't do that no spirits like if

3642.03 --> 3648.57
that kind of thing is caused by a spirit

3644.339 --> 3652.099
then it's usually just the fooling

3648.57 --> 3655.02
around type of spirits it's more like

3652.099 --> 3656.9100000000003
goblins or fairies this sounds really

3655.02 --> 3658.89
very very silly when I just say it like

3656.91 --> 3662.19
that but it's like certain type of

3658.89 --> 3664.589
frequency dang good like item very well

3662.19 --> 3667.32
familiar with them as I said like I got

3664.589 --> 3669.81
a whole house of goblins in that closet

3667.32 --> 3674.1600000000003
over there then they make all kinds of

3669.81 --> 3676.74
noise I think even at one time like a

3674.16 --> 3680.18
drawer open up like a centimeter just

3676.74 --> 3683.52
out of nowhere that kind of thing but

3680.18 --> 3686.27
those that how it feels are just like

3683.52 --> 3689.339
[Music]

3686.27 --> 3692.64
it's just like spirits that like to fool

3689.339 --> 3698.07
around or wanna alter things in some way

3692.64 --> 3700.41
this is wanting get involved where when

3698.07 --> 3700.77
they probably shouldn't that kind of

3700.41 --> 3704.52
thing

3700.77 --> 3707.19
troll spirits Meg well yeah maybe it is

3704.52 --> 3710.28
troll spirits it's just these things

3707.19 --> 3713.7200000000003
that want to get involved try to yeah it

3710.28 --> 3716.4900000000002
is kind of like trolls but they are not

3713.72 --> 3719.1899999999996
physical people it's not trolls in

3716.49 --> 3722.79
people it's like just spirits so maybe

3719.19 --> 3725.56
it's diseased trolls and their spirit

3722.79 --> 3729.6
just keeps on trolling

3725.56 --> 3729.6
[Laughter]

3730.64 --> 3735.269
and if that would be the case it would

3733.079 --> 3737.579
be a good reason not to want to kill off

3735.269 --> 3739.4399999999996
trolls because that means that their

3737.579 --> 3747.329
spirits just going to continue on and

3739.44 --> 3751.19
then you can ban him anymore yeah and

3747.329 --> 3753.6600000000003
don't kill trolls anyway you know just

3751.19 --> 3755.83
the best thing you can do it against

3753.66 --> 3758.8799999999997
trolls just let them fizzle

3755.83 --> 3758.88
[Music]

3763.76 --> 3767.039
[Music]

3778.13 --> 3780.789
hmm

3809.52 --> 3817.2599999999998
oh okay thanks creation bear I guess

3813.08 --> 3819.7999999999997
thanks for sending away my audience I'm

3817.26 --> 3819.8
not done yet

3835.17 --> 3838.9500000000003
all right but anyway yeah let's get into

3838.319 --> 3841.319
weird

3838.95 --> 3843.5299999999997
ethereal [ __ ] for a moment since we're

3841.319 --> 3846.599
talking about ghosts apparitions and

3843.53 --> 3847.079
like separate telekinetic activity and

3846.599 --> 3849.54
all that

3847.079 --> 3853.9500000000003
all right I've been studying into that

3849.54 --> 3855.54
like 20 years ago a lot was one of the

3853.95 --> 3858.0299999999997
things that I really wanted to achieve

3855.54 --> 3858.75
something with never really got it under

3858.03 --> 3861.3900000000003
control

3858.75 --> 3864.15
but it seems like psychokinetic activity

3861.39 --> 3867.3289999999997
does seem to follow me around but it's

3864.15 --> 3870.69
more to me like they are separate

3867.329 --> 3873.9
spirits and they may be siphoning off my

3870.69 --> 3876.809
energy in order to accomplish these

3873.9 --> 3880.4700000000003
little trickery things but as that

3876.809 --> 3886.1400000000003
happens when this type of tics and just

3880.47 --> 3889.5
thingies happen how it basically reaches

3886.14 --> 3891.66
my senses I always do get with it the

3889.5 --> 3896.79
frequency of what's going on it's like a

3891.66 --> 3899.97
little snap shock but something happens

3896.79 --> 3902.64
and with that it gives off like a

3899.97 --> 3904.41
frequency feel of it like what is the

3902.64 --> 3907.6189999999997
intention is it something like very

3904.41 --> 3910.71
anxious is it something that's just

3907.619 --> 3916.349
trying to fool around or being giddy you

3910.71 --> 3918.39
know because it is different and yeah

3916.349 --> 3923.4900000000002
the closet is kind of a giddy closet

3918.39 --> 3925.29
it's yeah it sounds so odd when I say it

3923.49 --> 3927.0299999999997
like that but every time science cuff

3925.29 --> 3932.16
comes off that it's either like just

3927.03 --> 3934.65
being kind of cozy and giddy or it is

3932.16 --> 3936.95
meddlesome I think there may be some

3934.65 --> 3939.42
essence of my mother in that closet too

3936.95 --> 3943.16
because yeah she was still around when

3939.42 --> 3943.16
she painted that thing you know that

3943.4 --> 3948.299
because it is kind of meddlesome no it's

3946.2 --> 3952.109
not that you had the cherries that here

3948.299 --> 3954.93
is super laid back literally that's what

3952.109 --> 3958.95
it's designated for that's how it is

3954.93 --> 3962.22
it's just really laid back good old

3958.95 --> 3964.74
chair it's just very still it's never

3962.22 --> 3966.89
done any kind of unexpected motion on me

3964.74 --> 3966.89
ever

3966.98 --> 3973.16
that closet over there that one gets

3970.41 --> 3973.16
really weird

3978.32 --> 3982.139
[Music]

3986.42 --> 3989.579
[Music]

4009.059 --> 4017.789
that's that's hilarious you have it

4012.009 --> 4021.279
I think I'd I think I'd recognize that

4017.789 --> 4023.2000000000003
if that would happen because yeah we're

4021.279 --> 4025.359
talking about freaking going to heaven

4023.2 --> 4028.359
okay we're talking about unleashing

4025.359 --> 4030.73
yourself from normal linear time-based

4028.359 --> 4033.7889999999998
consciousness and reaching into the over

4030.73 --> 4036.099
dimension and therefore transcending

4033.789 --> 4037.509
with your consciousness time itself and

4036.099 --> 4040.509
the meaning of things and especially

4037.509 --> 4042.7
when you enter the gates right if I had

4040.509 --> 4045.069
if I would be presented with a vision

4042.7 --> 4047.799
like that of an oblate spheroid you know

4045.069 --> 4049.39
how I would interpret it you have a ha

4047.799 --> 4051.759
ha ha this is funny you're not gonna

4049.39 --> 4055.239
expect yeah you know how I would

4051.759 --> 4059.47
interpret that I would recognize like

4055.239 --> 4063.9700000000003
yeah the people on earth they want to

4059.47 --> 4069.009
see it like a globe and that's why

4063.97 --> 4071.3799999999997
they're there it would represent leaving

4069.009 --> 4073.989
behind the world where lies are

4071.38 --> 4081.19
predominant that is what that would tell

4073.989 --> 4083.65
me because nobody not even God if he

4081.19 --> 4086.289
would choose to could fool me that the

4083.65 --> 4089.71
earth is literally geometrically a globe

4086.289 --> 4093.309
I don't think God the creator himself

4089.71 --> 4095.799
would in a direct communication sense in

4093.309 --> 4097.509
the end do that pretty damn sure he's

4095.799 --> 4102.359
not concerned with that nonsense he

4097.509 --> 4102.359
leaves that to his special servant

4110.6 --> 4118.610000000001
yeah yeah creation but they can never

4114.15 --> 4118.61
the bonus just can't understand this

4118.76 --> 4125.88
it's not a ball it really isn't you can

4122.85 --> 4128.1
think of it as a bowl that people think

4125.88 --> 4131.28
of it as a bow it has significant

4128.1 --> 4136.77
meaning and even a wider purpose in the

4131.28 --> 4139.25
scheme of all things but it is not a

4136.77 --> 4139.25
ball

4145.62 --> 4148.699
[Music]

4173.24 --> 4178.58
all right misery bear yeah it is like a

4175.85 --> 4183.89
toy fantasy and it's very amusing you

4178.58 --> 4188.11
know still I think there's something

4183.89 --> 4192.17
amusing to it but it's almost like a

4188.11 --> 4195.08
yeah and this is why I uneven foresaw

4192.17 --> 4198.77
and try to forward the idea of the dual

4195.08 --> 4201.23
cos monocle Society of where the globe

4198.77 --> 4205.160000000001
would be kept around as a learning toy

4201.23 --> 4208.73
because yeah it seems visually you know

4205.16 --> 4209.99
that you can go with it pretty easy but

4208.73 --> 4212.929999999999
when you start to think about the

4209.99 --> 4215.03
details then it really becomes like a

4212.93 --> 4217.52
big puzzle in figuring out how it

4215.03 --> 4219.92
doesn't work and by doing that you will

4217.52 --> 4222.47
learn so much about the world when if

4219.92 --> 4225.77
not confronted with the false globe

4222.47 --> 4228.05
cosmology most people probably wouldn't

4225.77 --> 4234.56
have learned so much about the real

4228.05 --> 4240.05
world you see you see how that makes the

4234.56 --> 4242.6900000000005
globe in the grand scheme of things like

4240.05 --> 4247.37
a big toy that could be learned from and

4242.69 --> 4250.96
not just a delusion to trap people in if

4247.37 --> 4250.96
dealt with properly

4254.9 --> 4258.0199999999995
[Music]

4259.869 --> 4264.499
but you have maybe at this point it's

4262.579 --> 4269.289
it's not the time because the people

4264.499 --> 4275.209
that that champion the globe are

4269.289 --> 4278.57
basically two delusional two drawn down

4275.209 --> 4282.409
into the pits of hell in order for them

4278.57 --> 4286.579
yet like in a way we should not give

4282.409 --> 4288.829
them mercy just because we like the

4286.579 --> 4291.32
globe they're wielding it and that's a

4288.829 --> 4294.289
problem because then even if we try to

4291.32 --> 4296.84
create the glory a globe tradition on

4294.289 --> 4299.209
how to deal with that separately from

4296.84 --> 4302.84
the mind control version of scientism

4299.209 --> 4306.559
and all that and consensus science blah

4302.84 --> 4309.289
blah blah then still the globe arts

4306.559 --> 4311.689
could meddle with that and basically try

4309.289 --> 4315.709
to get in there and take it over again

4311.689 --> 4319.039000000001
turn it into a cult if yeah if it slips

4315.709 --> 4321.76
by people so it's kind of first we got

4319.039 --> 4325.728999999999
to deal with this with this demonic

4321.76 --> 4328.099
infestation problem not saying it's any

4325.729 --> 4330.289000000001
like fatal solutions but we got to deal

4328.099 --> 4333.679
with all these people that have spiraled

4330.289 --> 4336.438999999999
out of control into lies have lost

4333.679 --> 4340.969
themselves first that has got to be

4336.439 --> 4347.179
taken care of in some way before a

4340.969 --> 4349.84
proper reboot of how to utilize the glow

4347.179 --> 4353.829
of cosmology can be attempted

4349.84 --> 4353.829
successfully on the long run

4376.9 --> 4383.7699999999995
ah now Missouri where you don't get it

4380.58 --> 4387.43
the upside-down it's all relative in the

4383.77 --> 4390.52
globe cosmology everything is gravity

4387.43 --> 4395.35
Centrepointe centric basically so there

4390.52 --> 4398.790000000001
everything is like in relation to one

4395.35 --> 4401.5
another it may be in opposition but

4398.79 --> 4407.41
effectively because of the gravity

4401.5 --> 4411.55
orientation it's all down see you just

4407.41 --> 4413.29
got a warp you go to our base warp the

4411.55 --> 4417.16
orientation of things and how you

4413.29 --> 4422.38
conceive of directions reroute that to

4417.16 --> 4422.83
our and then it's much easier to believe

4422.38 --> 4429.25
it

4422.83 --> 4431.59
this is but yeah if you all take it

4429.25 --> 4434.53
literal if you take it like a literal

4431.59 --> 4439.45
ball then yeah slide down it does seem

4434.53 --> 4442.5
ridiculous I guess but I don't know I've

4439.45 --> 4444.88
never really got hung up on that part

4442.5 --> 4446.35
thank you good servant for the dollar

4444.88 --> 4448.650000000001
ship which a donation thanks for the

4446.35 --> 4448.650000000001
nickel

4464.62 --> 4467.739
[Music]

4474.35 --> 4484.46
yeah I appreciate it good servant please

4482.57 --> 4488.8099999999995
by the way do not forget that if you

4484.46 --> 4492.17
want to support me and be part of my

4488.81 --> 4495.910000000001
channel and help keeping me up here that

4492.17 --> 4499.25
you can also now become a member and

4495.91 --> 4503.09
yeah it doesn't have to be it's a pretty

4499.25 --> 4506.18
low threshold and you can go up there

4503.09 --> 4507.860000000001
and yeah there will be some perks coming

4506.18 --> 4512.4800000000005
with that as soon as I figure out how I

4507.86 --> 4514.28
already tried to do a Members Only

4512.48 --> 4515.9
stream even though I don't have a lot of

4514.28 --> 4518.509999999999
members yet just to see if I could do it

4515.9 --> 4520.49
but I couldn't figure out how to set it

4518.51 --> 4526.64
like that it just didn't work

4520.49 --> 4528.59
need some help maybe right and yeah the

4526.64 --> 4531.89
paypal of course if you want to help me

4528.59 --> 4535.07
directly especially concerning while

4531.89 --> 4538.9400000000005
saving up for the for a new air filter

4535.07 --> 4542.599999999999
system it's kind of set to be the fresh

4538.94 --> 4548.33
air system but I I've kind of really

4542.6 --> 4550.51
that that choice into a pro pure air

4548.33 --> 4553.93
filtration system which is much cheaper

4550.51 --> 4556.34
so that's what I'm aiming for right now

4553.93 --> 4558.62
in a retrospect was a better choice

4556.34 --> 4561.29
probably after all basically Rasta

4558.62 --> 4566.54
convinced me and yeah he can be very

4561.29 --> 4568.67
persuasive and if you want to help out

4566.54 --> 4572.78
with that then PayPal indeed is the the

4568.67 --> 4576.2300000000005
best option I get it directly no cuts is

4572.78 --> 4579.2
being taken out and it reaches me

4576.23 --> 4584.48
relatively quick usually like a

4579.2 --> 4586.79
three-day period so if you want to help

4584.48 --> 4589.5199999999995
me out and support me if you really like

4586.79 --> 4593.2699999999995
what I have to say the things that I'm

4589.52 --> 4596.860000000001
trying to highlight and explain then

4593.27 --> 4596.860000000001
please support me if you can

4599.34 --> 4606.28
and also hey if you wanna use this is

4603.94 --> 4609.179999999999
the thing that I don't say a lot if you

4606.28 --> 4611.679999999999
kind of want to use clips of me I

4609.18 --> 4613.150000000001
personally don't really do it as you may

4611.68 --> 4614.56
have taken out is I'm not somebody

4613.15 --> 4616.15
that's kind of like oh I'm gonna watch

4614.56 --> 4616.96
this show and then cut down all the

4616.15 --> 4618.82
clips out of it

4616.96 --> 4622.12
hey if somebody else wants to do that

4618.82 --> 4624.34
that's okay with me you know as long as

4622.12 --> 4626.5599999999995
they're not doing it for trollish

4624.34 --> 4629.650000000001
purposes now unfortunately I can't

4626.56 --> 4632.29
really stop them because now reporting

4629.65 --> 4634.0599999999995
has become quite a hassle and yeah that

4632.29 --> 4637.48
shit's being there's been videos of me

4634.06 --> 4638.280000000001
for ages now for years so many I lost

4637.48 --> 4641.11
count

4638.28 --> 4646.08
crazy videos make me look as crazy as

4641.11 --> 4648.549999999999
they can but hey if you kind of like

4646.08 --> 4650.98
like the things that I have to say or

4648.55 --> 4653.08
you have some inspiration concerning

4650.98 --> 4655.5599999999995
things I had to say then you are

4653.08 --> 4658.24
absolutely free to use aspects of that

4655.56 --> 4661.75
not saying that people necessarily would

4658.24 --> 4666.4
want that maybe it's like too much of a

4661.75 --> 4668.5
now this is like that doesn't feel safe

4666.4 --> 4670.839999999999
to you or you don't really know what to

4668.5 --> 4673.6
do with it then don't worry about it

4670.84 --> 4676.6900000000005
I'm just saying it's okay if you want to

4673.6 --> 4678.79
take clips from from my shows or from

4676.69 --> 4681.549999999999
things that I said you can do it

4678.79 --> 4685.06
I'm giving permission for that as long

4681.55 --> 4689.95
as you do inform me at least talk to me

4685.06 --> 4692.38
about it and hey if you've put something

4689.95 --> 4694.21
interesting together with pieces of

4692.38 --> 4696.28
things that I've said and it's a good

4694.21 --> 4698.46
video then I'll even shout you out on my

4696.28 --> 4698.46
show

4704.309 --> 4720.1990000000005
all right but maybe I'm just not I'm

4719.159 --> 4722.8189999999995
good

4720.199 --> 4725.129
I'm not gonna downplay myself any longer

4722.819 --> 4727.469
you know I have this is let's get

4725.129 --> 4728.599
personal for a few seconds I always need

4727.469 --> 4734.429
to do that

4728.599 --> 4737.849
right I still have this view on myself

4734.429 --> 4740.4890000000005
because I see very wide that I realized

4737.849 --> 4743.189
like yeah me as a person here compared

4740.489 --> 4746.239
to a lot of other people out there it's

4743.189 --> 4750.2390000000005
not really as good as I want it to be

4746.239 --> 4753.898999999999
but then again I also realized that

4750.239 --> 4756.119
other people just won't see the detail

4753.899 --> 4757.559
of the flaws that I see about myself as

4756.119 --> 4760.308999999999
much and they'll appreciate their

4757.559 --> 4762.629
overlooking much more easily and

4760.309 --> 4765.089
probably won't even notice most things

4762.629 --> 4769.619
that disturbed me because they're it's

4765.089 --> 4772.829
they're not me so I'm I had this bad

4769.619 --> 4775.589
habit it's it was pretty bad especially

4772.829 --> 4777.688999999999
at the start when it started you this is

4775.589 --> 4780.839
just like feeling very nervous bad about

4777.689 --> 4783.3
myself and just saying like now I'm

4780.839 --> 4786.449
shitty like I'm not that good and I'm

4783.3 --> 4790.409000000001
gonna stop doing that because I am that

4786.449 --> 4797.339
good I really am it's just I'm not

4790.409 --> 4799.1089999999995
perfect but I'm good enough and so every

4797.339 --> 4801.059
time I get this tendency now that I'm

4799.109 --> 4803.249000000001
gonna just say like how I wouldn't able

4801.059 --> 4806.789
to do that nobody likes me I'm just

4803.249 --> 4810.809
gonna zip it that's something I'm gonna

4806.789 --> 4812.0689999999995
do for me and for you guys because every

4810.809 --> 4815.189
time I do it doesn't really help you

4812.069 --> 4816.869000000001
either you guys know that I have a lot

4815.189 --> 4818.879
of doubts and criticism about myself

4816.869 --> 4821.639
because I've shared that plenty of times

4818.879 --> 4824.0689999999995
so I don't need to reinforce that I

4821.639 --> 4826.889
don't want that to rub off on you

4824.069 --> 4829.919000000001
because it's actually a bad habit as a

4826.889 --> 4832.369
public thing now if you're a person one

4829.919 --> 4835.26
on one that's different and in public

4832.369 --> 4837.48
it's not really good thing to do it's

4835.26 --> 4839.58
not really evil but it's just not really

4837.48 --> 4842.549999999999
thing to do and I'm gonna try to break

4839.58 --> 4846.2
away from doing that entirely and not

4842.55 --> 4846.2
downplay myself anymore

4847.489 --> 4852.2699999999995
you know there's already enough trolls

4850.32 --> 4856.2
out there trying to do that constantly I

4852.27 --> 4858.870000000001
don't need to give them a hand and I

4856.2 --> 4861.45
have more energy available to me I have

4858.87 --> 4864.989
more certainty about Who I am what I'm

4861.45 --> 4872.82
doing and where I'm going and Trust and

4864.989 --> 4874.739
that'll be alright so I don't need to to

4872.82 --> 4876.469999999999
throw these vulnerabilities in front of

4874.739 --> 4879.45
me because I've kind of already

4876.47 --> 4881.820000000001
accounted for it

4879.45 --> 4886.29
balancing it out and I can do more I

4881.82 --> 4887.61
there's no more need effectively because

4886.29 --> 4889.65
it did have a purpose you know throwing

4887.61 --> 4893.19
out your weaknesses is kind of was my

4889.65 --> 4896.429999999999
way of protecting myself by preventing

4893.19 --> 4898.5
myself from closing off and holding

4896.43 --> 4902.01
secrets about how I think about myself

4898.5 --> 4904.77
and feel about myself that's where it

4902.01 --> 4907.67
starts throwing out like I feel [ __ ]

4904.77 --> 4910.620000000001
about much just to be open and honest

4907.67 --> 4914.13
but when you start to become able to

4910.62 --> 4917.79
work on it then just keeping doing it it

4914.13 --> 4920.79
loses its function and I think I've

4917.79 --> 4923.16
reached that point where yeah the

4920.79 --> 4925.83
honesty has been established the

4923.16 --> 4927.75
weaknesses have been exposed and they're

4925.83 --> 4930.84
being dealt with and some of them are

4927.75 --> 4934.76
completely dealt with so I am going to

4930.84 --> 4939.24
completely stop downplaying myself now

4934.76 --> 4946.7390000000005
and things will be good they will be

4939.24 --> 4946.739
[Music]

4953.53 --> 4960.099
right Marco buck yeah isn't that isn't

4955.809 --> 4962.409000000001
that annoying I have the same thing with

4960.099 --> 4966.55
like my roommates and it's so odd

4962.409 --> 4969.159
because it's in a way because a lot of

4966.55 --> 4972.6990000000005
people aren't in conspiracy thinking in

4969.159 --> 4975.94
figuring things out really see that's

4972.699 --> 4981.249
what it really is it's not conspiracy

4975.94 --> 4985.178999999999
thinking it's figuring things out funny

4981.249 --> 4987.369
isn't it how figuring things out to

4985.179 --> 4990.219
somebody doing that constantly always

4987.369 --> 4993.579
being busy figuring things out that's

4990.219 --> 4997.619
now been reworded into conspiracy

4993.579 --> 5000.659
theorists well it's basically just

4997.619 --> 5002.929
figuring things out having that as a

5000.659 --> 5006.36
habit figuring things out anything

5002.929 --> 5010.38
everything anything everything well

5006.36 --> 5013.228999999999
people that don't do that they think oh

5010.38 --> 5016.05
good spirit I don't like to think about

5013.229 --> 5021.4400000000005
that Stu I want to just square it our

5016.05 --> 5025.639
just go on watch stupid [ __ ] and just

5021.44 --> 5029.518999999999
stare and be comfortably numb without

5025.639 --> 5031.769
yeah any responsibility or consequence

5029.519 --> 5037.829000000001
like that that's what the normies like

5031.769 --> 5041.070000000001
to do but then because they do that they

5037.829 --> 5043.11
don't see how things are going out of

5041.07 --> 5045.69
control they don't see the railroads

5043.11 --> 5047.429
they end up on because they don't have

5045.69 --> 5052.71
oversight because they don't like to

5047.429 --> 5054.63
look into things and I do so to me it's

5052.71 --> 5056.4
weird I can follow people that I've

5054.63 --> 5059.55
effectively I don't know their name I've

5056.4 --> 5061.348999999999
never even spoken to them but just from

5059.55 --> 5065.13
seeing them walking around seeing how

5061.349 --> 5067.979
they meet people bring people along I

5065.13 --> 5071.6990000000005
could just figure that out without ever

5067.979 --> 5074.909000000001
having talked to them because I figure

5071.699 --> 5077.28
things out and they often are like oh

5074.909 --> 5078.9
well I don't know I sometimes you can

5077.28 --> 5082.05
hear people like oh I don't know why

5078.9 --> 5084.5599999999995
this is happening to me enough and I'm

5082.05 --> 5087.27
like yeah

5084.56 --> 5090.120000000001
yeah I could probably tell you why

5087.27 --> 5099.540000000001
that's happening to you but you just

5090.12 --> 5101.55
want to fend off some steam right and by

5099.54 --> 5104.28
the way funnily enough that also comes

5101.55 --> 5107.31
for myself a time but then again when I

5104.28 --> 5109.259999999999
am in that mode I usually do realize why

5107.31 --> 5111.780000000001
I ended up in that position at that

5109.26 --> 5114.2
moment it's very of getting familiar

5111.78 --> 5114.2
with me

5125.699 --> 5131.829
yeah Marko bucks what if ignorance

5128.289 --> 5134.759999999999
wasn't bliss then there wouldn't be so

5131.829 --> 5134.759999999999
many ignorant people

5145.28 --> 5148.38
[Music]

5153.38 --> 5157.36
all right I'll be right back

5262.03 --> 5267.46
right some of that

5289.56 --> 5295.580000000001
you watch Yuma I don't know what that is

5292.29 --> 5295.58
random Explorer

5303.36 --> 5305.989
okay

5307.159 --> 5314.949
that's a place in Japan a temple all

5312.77 --> 5314.9490000000005
right

5319.58 --> 5324.45
cool it's like a temple in the middle of

5322.5 --> 5328.01
a remnant of a temple a thing in the

5324.45 --> 5328.01
middle of the water that's fascinating

5336.8 --> 5340.3
that is very interesting

5362.469 --> 5368.249
it's it's interesting to even see it

5365.26 --> 5368.249
like that

5373.15 --> 5378.61
because it almost seems like it's like

5375.88 --> 5383.56
an electrical device or an antenna or

5378.61 --> 5386.16
something just the way it looks in the

5383.56 --> 5386.160000000001
water like that

5393.52 --> 5400.75
all right let's see if I can share that

5395.98 --> 5403.41
for a second because it does look really

5400.75 --> 5403.41
special

5419.8 --> 5426.819
come on

5422.81 --> 5426.819
[Music]

5449.149 --> 5454.579000000001
all right anyway I'm just gonna show it

5451.249 --> 5459.619
like this it's always messy all right so

5454.579 --> 5463.129
this that to me looks it really looks

5459.619 --> 5465.558999999999
like it's an antenna something that's

5463.129 --> 5467.86
like an electrical device involving the

5465.559 --> 5471.379
water maybe it does something to like

5467.86 --> 5474.919
the energy the electrical energy maybe

5471.379 --> 5477.139
it is based on like very ancient like

5474.919 --> 5482.36
tartarean or Praetorian or something

5477.139 --> 5485.349
like that architecture it is certainly

5482.36 --> 5485.348999999999
fascinating

5492.28 --> 5496.92
just the gate well maybe

5518.44 --> 5521.62
[Music]

5526.92 --> 5531.17
[Music]

5539.519 --> 5546.4800000000005
yeah

5541.469 --> 5548.699
right ekabo I mean George Sanford yeah

5546.48 --> 5551.5199999999995
well who knows you know it's but this is

5548.699 --> 5554.58
fantasy at this moment okay but with

5551.52 --> 5556.8
that thing it almost makes me imagine

5554.58 --> 5559.59
like it would be collecting energy and

5556.8 --> 5563.63
then loading the water or something like

5559.59 --> 5569.76
it's energizing the water I don't know

5563.63 --> 5571.7300000000005
maybe it's yeah maybe I'm just looking

5569.76 --> 5577.05
too much into it

5571.73 --> 5579.0
imagining but I don't know who knows

5577.05 --> 5582.42
there's actually something to that maybe

5579.0 --> 5593.61
my intuition is picking up on something

5582.42 --> 5596.54
an ancient function that's how a battery

5593.61 --> 5596.54
works right

5605.42 --> 5608.74
they don't use nails

5618.76 --> 5638.63
interesting so I guess they what's damn

5635.059 --> 5640.6990000000005
it it's a second time today but I guess

5638.63 --> 5643.9400000000005
that they puzzle it together then if

5640.699 --> 5646.159
they don't use nails or anything then

5643.94 --> 5647.69
they must be just puzzling things

5646.159 --> 5653.509999999999
together in an efficient way

5647.69 --> 5656.268999999999
I don't know how else you would do it so

5653.51 --> 5658.01
they'd have to design completely in a

5656.269 --> 5661.75
puzzle list fashion to make everything

5658.01 --> 5661.75
work and fit and stable

5670.24 --> 5677.969999999999
wooden pecks to join joints right they

5673.75 --> 5677.97
could yeah of course that could work

5699.2 --> 5702.41
symbolic okay

5709.48 --> 5715.48
I'd be interested to see where that

5712.38 --> 5719.2
symbolic nature comes from where that

5715.48 --> 5724.389999999999
where where it is basically being

5719.2 --> 5727.0599999999995
ascribe to doing that and why because if

5724.39 --> 5730.0
that is really true if that symbol is

5727.06 --> 5731.830000000001
like really a real thing and not just a

5730.0 --> 5734.14
current cultural interpretation like but

5731.83 --> 5735.85
if I'm just wondering you already said

5734.14 --> 5738.9400000000005
that the place has this special energy

5735.85 --> 5743.9800000000005
to it so then wonder like is there an

5738.94 --> 5750.58
ancient architecture design secret in

5743.98 --> 5758.889999999999
that it of like the the effects of

5750.58 --> 5762.01
shapes I wrote a piece about that 24

5758.89 --> 5765.1
years ago it's still on there it's still

5762.01 --> 5769.35
on the website symbolic stat now the

5765.1 --> 5769.35
nature of shapes and power of shapes

5773.45 --> 5783.62
so yeah that kind of thing does

5775.1 --> 5786.31
fascinate me right so it comes from

5783.62 --> 5786.3099999999995
Shintoism

5789.98 --> 5793.099999999999
all right

5796.69 --> 5800.23
demonic circles

5800.51 --> 5803.7390000000005
what do you mean

5807.59 --> 5812.83
[Music]

5813.139 --> 5816.139
what

5834.29 --> 5837.5199999999995
what does that mean

5848.8 --> 5856.269
you mean like diagrams all right like

5852.249 --> 5858.15
yeah diagrams to remember things right

5856.269 --> 5862.84
now that's different

5858.15 --> 5865.449
Almond mnemonic diagrams and circles are

5862.84 --> 5866.8
effective for memorization but that's

5865.449 --> 5869.169999999999
not the same thing because it is

5866.8 --> 5872.769
basically a reflection board on how the

5869.17 --> 5876.909
on the architecture of the mind rather

5872.769 --> 5882.150000000001
than and the memory and a conscious but

5876.909 --> 5884.92
I was talking more about energy altering

5882.15 --> 5887.079
effects from architecture I guess it

5884.92 --> 5891.4
falls more in the direction of what is

5887.079 --> 5893.799999999999
called again from Shoei like how things

5891.4 --> 5896.17
are arranged matters for the flow of

5893.8 --> 5898.829000000001
things it's more in the in that

5896.17 --> 5903.309
direction side to thinking just shapes

5898.829 --> 5906.909
the materials to just what does it do

5903.309 --> 5908.7390000000005
what does a shape do what does material

5906.909 --> 5911.92
do in combination with the shape in

5908.739 --> 5917.489
combination with the position you know

5911.92 --> 5917.4890000000005
it's like that

5923.35 --> 5928.160000000001
all right yeah that's true Marko bags

5926.0 --> 5931.22
yes absolutely the media constantly

5928.16 --> 5935.48
tries to railroad people's minds by

5931.22 --> 5938.63
giving them very handy prefab prisons

5935.48 --> 5942.62
that make it mentally very easy for them

5938.63 --> 5945.05
to adapt to their will and yeah they've

5942.62 --> 5949.22
utilized everything everything they can

5945.05 --> 5951.91
to accomplish that including manam onyx

5949.22 --> 5951.91
absolutely

5957.39 --> 5960.39
okay

5976.61 --> 5985.29
yeah a Marco box 8 oh if you wanna I

5982.35 --> 5987.17
don't know have a even a recorded

5985.29 --> 5990.2699999999995
conversation or a live conversation

5987.17 --> 5993.6900000000005
sometime not on the early bird show I

5990.27 --> 5996.120000000001
think or on skype something like that

5993.69 --> 5998.61
even in Dutch I'm all open for it I've

5996.12 --> 6001.88
already said that I'm pretty much open

5998.61 --> 6006.0199999999995
for Dutch Flat Earth based and related

6001.88 --> 6009.86
hangouts I'm open for business pretty

6006.02 --> 6017.06
much so hey if you're up to it if you

6009.86 --> 6019.79
think you can handle me go like I have a

6017.06 --> 6022.64
lot of time on my hands relatively right

6019.79 --> 6025.79
it's not like I'm literally wasting at

6022.64 --> 6029.9800000000005
all still using it but there is room for

6025.79 --> 6029.98
more things

6039.54 --> 6047.16
I have no idea kappa i'm not gonna well

6044.85 --> 6051.59
that happens that usually means somebody

6047.16 --> 6051.59
just i don't know

6051.98 --> 6057.57
close their car door a little bit too

6054.33 --> 6062.55
hard or whatever or bumped into the the

6057.57 --> 6064.17
pavement i don't know i don't hear a lot

6062.55 --> 6067.55
of car alarms anymore and this is good

6064.17 --> 6067.55
because they're stupid and annoying

6079.89 --> 6085.77
don't want to be on a panel just man oh

6082.08 --> 6087.03
man yeah sure of course that's fine I'm

6085.77 --> 6090.42
open for that Marco backs

6087.03 --> 6092.219999999999
whenever yeah whenever you want whenever

6090.42 --> 6094.97

all by heart but I know it's pretty damn

6120.03 --> 6125.599999999999
elaborate there's all these declarations

6122.79 --> 6128.6
and stories integrated in that and

6125.6 --> 6128.6
history

6139.31 --> 6145.8
okay that's an interesting suggestion

6142.62 --> 6148.59
acaba I don't know if I will but who

but yeah Marco box it would be great to

6205.229 --> 6211.889
have a conversation sometime about such

6208.409 --> 6215.719

6211.889 --> 6218.789
influences from media be very interested

6215.719 --> 6222.059
to like I don't know look through

6218.789 --> 6227.249
examples and then basically determinate

6222.059 --> 6230.610000000001
figure it out what what it is what it is

6227.249 --> 6233.719
likely to or can potentially do to the

6230.61 --> 6236.13
unconscious mind love to go through that

6233.719 --> 6240.42
alright but I am gonna round out the

6236.13 --> 6242.82
