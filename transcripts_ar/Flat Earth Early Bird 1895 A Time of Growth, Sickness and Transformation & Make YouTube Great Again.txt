regular

250.33 --> 253.419
[Music]

254.159 --> 258.199
event like nothing that would really

256.4 --> 262.359
stand out or

258.199 --> 262.35900000000004
anything nothing magical about

262.8 --> 268.72
it was basically meeting up with some

265.52 --> 271.68
person that I don't know who that

268.72 --> 273.03900000000004
is

271.68 --> 274.759

273.039 --> 277.24

274.759 --> 280.52000000000004
creepy turned out to

277.24 --> 280.52
be they

285.12 --> 290.52
like yeah they like how I really noticed

288.4 --> 293.23999999999995
is that like they were just basically

290.52 --> 296.56
switching stuff in front of my face

293.24 --> 298.12
without me noticing and like even like

296.56 --> 302.199
switched my phone

298.12 --> 306.16
out cuz I wanted to

302.199 --> 307.24
like contact somebody over it when I

306.16 --> 309.8
started to

307.24 --> 311.919
notice and then like I didn't have my

309.8 --> 315.24
phone it was all just very

311.919 --> 315.24

344.759 --> 347.28000000000003
to do with

349.28 --> 353.479
that just I don't really

358.639 --> 361.639

390.96 --> 395.31899999999996
I stayed up

392.68 --> 398.759
late because of circumstances and that

395.319 --> 398.759

399.52 --> 407.15999999999997
good like it needs to stop I need to

402.72 --> 407.16

you hello rone

715.04 --> 721.24
Thorson what are you doing

718.24 --> 721.24
here

745.199 --> 752.519
David Banner

747.32 --> 752.519
Channel okay what about his

753.72 --> 758.48
channel thank you for sticking it to

756.639 --> 762.6800000000001
Dell

758.48 --> 765.0
okay I don't know why he'd thank me for

762.68 --> 765.0
that I

765.24 --> 768.5600000000001
mean but

769.079 --> 774.959
sure any man that sticks it

771.959 --> 774.959
to

778.12 --> 781.92
okay

779.72 --> 784.519
I mean it was all kind of

781.92 --> 786.36
ridiculous him saying that he was going

784.519 --> 787.519
to lie about me now and all that that

786.36 --> 791.6800000000001
was just

787.519 --> 791.68
like what the hell was the point of

799.44 --> 807.399
that right and besides it's

803.959 --> 811.04
like it it was the

807.399 --> 814.04
argument argument is just just waste of

811.04 --> 816.8389999999999
time I explained about it and it it is

814.04 --> 818.16
what it is and like I don't really care

816.839 --> 821.6
that

818.16 --> 824.519
much but I have noticed that Dell is

821.6 --> 827.639
that's just all he talks about now so

824.519 --> 827.639
I'm just not interested

828.56 --> 833.88
anymore it's a FES

835.12 --> 841.04
argument what do you

838.04 --> 841.04
mean

842.199 --> 848.7589999999999
flatter Society yeah

846.279 --> 852.36
yeah I guess it

848.759 --> 855.839
is I did associate it with that

852.36 --> 859.16
even like when that first came when he

855.839 --> 863.24
first started to bring that up I

859.16 --> 863.24
recognized it from the flatter

868.04 --> 871.04
Society

898.04 --> 901.04
e

919.98 --> 923.8000000000001
[Music]

921.839 --> 925.519
all right so yeah it's going to be a bit

923.8 --> 927.959
of a puzzle for me to figure out what

925.519 --> 930.9590000000001
I'm going to fill the show with

927.959 --> 930.959
today

931.79 --> 934.919
[Music]

940.399 --> 946.1
yesterday for me was kind of a weird day

942.6 --> 949.19
I had a bit of a coffee

946.1 --> 949.19
[Music]

950.16 --> 956.24
rage it's just that watching info wars

953.44 --> 959.8800000000001
and some of these news items and it just

956.24 --> 962.319
really got to me and I'm like we got to

959.88 --> 964.279
do something now like basically the rage

962.319 --> 967.24
win from my

964.279 --> 970.24
past about it and the warnings I gave

967.24 --> 972.6800000000001
like it's only going to stop when you

970.24 --> 972.6800000000001
take them

975.399 --> 980.6
down flatter Society is not a powerful

978.079 --> 983.079
group

980.6 --> 986.279
no but they are

983.079 --> 990.92
connected in

986.279 --> 990.92
ways hello Nathan r

1015.56 --> 1020.8389999999999
do I believe in evolution absolutely not

1024.839 --> 1028.319
talked about it yesterday Nathan

1047.84 --> 1050.84
r

1061.0 --> 1067.72
yeah and uh yes there are shows of mine

1064.88 --> 1070.0800000000002
in the past being taken down because of

1067.72 --> 1071.799
the certain subject references that at

1070.08 --> 1074.039
the time didn't seem to matter and now

1071.799 --> 1077.36
they're all but I mean all those shows

1074.039 --> 1079.72
are pretty insignificant anyway

1077.36 --> 1084.6
so don't come comment about it don't

1079.72 --> 1084.6000000000001
bring it up or outban you it's that

1091.4 --> 1098.1200000000001
simple expect a lot more because I did

1094.52 --> 1099.679
talk a lot about it and it served its

1098.12 --> 1105.0
purpose it's

1099.679 --> 1107.039
not I did it to to warn people at the

1105.0 --> 1110.0
time that's the

1107.039 --> 1111.72
reason that's why kept coming back up

1110.0 --> 1114.4
because I was just very worried about

1111.72 --> 1116.4
the world and that's

1114.4 --> 1119.0800000000002
it

1116.4 --> 1122.919
like it technically doesn't matter to me

1119.08 --> 1127.48
whether these shows are up or

1122.919 --> 1127.48
not they serve their function back

1127.64 --> 1133.7990000000002
then

1129.6 --> 1137.12
and yeah I don't really need him anymore

1133.799 --> 1140.72
so keep going with that hey Amanda Yung

1137.12 --> 1140.7199999999998
good to see you

1150.679 --> 1155.159
yeah yesterday also on Infowars was

1152.6 --> 1158.36
interesting it was also they're really

1155.159 --> 1161.2
bringing forth more of

1158.36 --> 1164.12
this alternative biology basically

1161.2 --> 1166.96
recognizing like there's no real

1164.12 --> 1169.52
physical evidence of viruses and all

1166.96 --> 1171.96
that it's very

1169.52 --> 1174.76
interesting like they've been rolling it

1171.96 --> 1177.559
out for a while for a while slowly and

1174.76 --> 1179.36
they they're they're bringing it back

1177.559 --> 1182.36
that's good that's good I'm I'm glad

1179.36 --> 1182.36
they're finally doing

1187.919 --> 1196.6000000000001
it it's a a little bit embarrassing if

1191.48 --> 1196.6
you realize like how dream about me

1197.64 --> 1200.64
huh

1203.6 --> 1206.8799999999999
well if they just nuke the whole Channel

1205.2 --> 1209.88
then it's

1206.88 --> 1213.0800000000002
gone then I'll just start a new channel

1209.88 --> 1213.0800000000002
but I don't think they

1227.64 --> 1230.64
will

1231.44 --> 1238.72
they might if I am foolish enough to

1234.48 --> 1240.76
like start hyping up about the subject

1238.72 --> 1243.6000000000001
again and I

1240.76 --> 1246.72
won't anybody in the chat that will try

1243.6 --> 1246.7199999999998
to do that will be

1250.159 --> 1257.6000000000001
banned yeah so that's a kind of comment

1253.6 --> 1260.6
that you don't get to make Nathan

1257.6 --> 1260.6
r

1267.08 --> 1274.559
yeah that very

1268.84 --> 1274.559
specific word you don't get to use in my

1287.52 --> 1290.52
chat

1297.24 --> 1301.279
oh okay Amanda that sounds like a nice

1301.919 --> 1306.24

1317.52 --> 1320.52
nice

1323.6 --> 1331.1589999999999
it wasn't bit weird though

1326.4 --> 1334.88
like I wonder like did I dream of you as

1331.159 --> 1337.96
well maybe but I mean from my side it

1334.88 --> 1340.2
wasn't that great it certainly wasn't

1337.96 --> 1343.2
like smoking

1340.2 --> 1343.2
anything

1345.24 --> 1352.76
weird but it was like with a black lady

1349.279 --> 1355.76

1475.76 --> 1480.6

1543.84 --> 1550.0
this terrible cabinet di missionary

1547.799 --> 1554.24
cabinet seems like a lot of things that

1550.0 --> 1555.559
they've like done are being reversed

1554.24 --> 1560.24
which

1555.559 --> 1560.24
is quite exhilarating

1561.039 --> 1565.44
like certain

1562.279 --> 1567.84
fines doctors got because of their

1565.44 --> 1569.2
treatments you know yeah I'm not going

1567.84 --> 1571.8799999999999
to even mention

1569.2 --> 1574.1200000000001
that the the finds are getting reversed

1571.88 --> 1577.24
so this interesting developments there's

1574.12 --> 1579.12
a lot of hassle going on not surprising

1577.24 --> 1582.64
that people would get

1579.12 --> 1584.6399999999999
sick and that's because of logic from

1582.64 --> 1587.3990000000001
German new

1584.64 --> 1589.0800000000002
medicine because in German new medicine

1587.399 --> 1592.4399999999998
explains that

1589.08 --> 1594.9189999999999
we have a conflict an issue something

1592.44 --> 1597.919
that's a problem

1594.919 --> 1601.159
psychologically and then when it gets

1597.919 --> 1603.48
resolved is when you actually get sick

1601.159 --> 1606.5200000000002
because the sickness is then the part of

1603.48 --> 1610.2
the Regeneration

1606.52 --> 1613.279
process and there seems to be a lot all

1610.2 --> 1613.279
of a sudden it's

1613.919 --> 1618.88
like

1615.6 --> 1621.9189999999999
the Communist Elite

1618.88 --> 1625.7990000000002
and all their evil de dehumanizing

1621.919 --> 1628.679
things they've been like breaking up at

1625.799 --> 1630.96
the seams and it's like it's literally

1628.679 --> 1634.2
crumbling at a rapid Pace all of a

1630.96 --> 1636.559
sudden like like a balloon that's just

1634.2 --> 1638.52
suddenly starting to disintegrate like

1636.559 --> 1640.0
the the rubber suddenly like that's

1638.52 --> 1642.76
happening right

1640.0 --> 1646.159
now at a very rapid Pace there's

1642.76 --> 1648.76
something they switched something on

1646.159 --> 1650.919
right something is switching support the

1648.76 --> 1653.919
Dutch Farmers we need our

1650.919 --> 1657.44
bacon

1653.919 --> 1661.2
right I told you it would happen right

1657.44 --> 1663.72
something would happen like very quickly

1661.2 --> 1666.919
this year and I've been feeling it this

1663.72 --> 1670.919
month and like dude I've been having

1666.919 --> 1673.519
like pretty damn powerful panic attacks

1670.919 --> 1676.519
and [ __ ]

1673.519 --> 1680.1200000000001
and potentially some really severe

1676.519 --> 1680.1200000000001
hallucinations as well

1681.399 --> 1689.12
or rather building up to that so I might

1685.6 --> 1692.08
be in like my own restoration cycle I

1689.12 --> 1694.84
like in the last few weeks I've already

1692.08 --> 1700.08
described that I feel really different

1694.84 --> 1700.08
like really really different in

1701.519 --> 1706.039
ways

1703.159 --> 1709.0390000000002
like I

1706.039 --> 1711.399
transformed on the inside

1709.039 --> 1713.24
and not just like a seasonal

1711.399 --> 1715.5189999999998
transformation which is by the way now

1713.24 --> 1717.84
also happening and which would also be

1715.519 --> 1720.72
part of the explanation on why suddenly

1717.84 --> 1722.9189999999999
a lot of people got sick it's the season

1720.72 --> 1724.3990000000001
for that that typically happens around

1722.919 --> 1727.3990000000001
this

1724.399 --> 1727.399
time

1727.96 --> 1733.0
like basically the last two weeks of

1730.96 --> 1735.159
March is when that

1733.0 --> 1738.279
happens around

1735.159 --> 1740.88
that it's also when in previous years I

1738.279 --> 1742.88
would get like serious issues with my

1740.88 --> 1745.1200000000001
jaw all of a sudden it happens around

1742.88 --> 1745.1200000000001
this

1749.72 --> 1754.279
time at the parasite you me

1766.72 --> 1772.96
no that's not a that's not a nice thing

1769.84 --> 1772.9599999999998
to say too by the

1774.08 --> 1779.9189999999999
way all right so where are my

1777.6 --> 1782.7199999999998
regulars you guys are kind of spamming

1779.919 --> 1785.279
up my chat I do I can't say I appreciate

1782.72 --> 1787.559
that teeth grinding is yeah I'm not

1785.279 --> 1787.559
teeth

1789.799 --> 1794.96
grinding arons are exposing themselves

1795.12 --> 1800.9599999999998
maybe stop spamming and stop using

1803.279 --> 1810.36
caps this is not Dell's

1806.76 --> 1810.36
chat don't do

1812.559 --> 1819.6789999999999
that that's nice support and all

1815.6 --> 1822.6
that I need my chat my chat is not just

1819.679 --> 1826.96
a free-for-all Spam it all you like and

1822.6 --> 1829.9599999999998
use it to communicate it's part of my

1826.96 --> 1829.96
show

1835.0 --> 1838.559
yeah that's too bad don't use

1842.0 --> 1845.44
it not in

1854.2 --> 1859.799
here it's very

1856.919 --> 1863.679
distracting

1859.799 --> 1866.08
okay so it's all very cute but if you

1863.679 --> 1869.5590000000002
keep this up I will kick you

1866.08 --> 1869.559
out you

1880.799 --> 1886.9189999999999
understand yeah it does seem like a chat

1883.279 --> 1888.6
invation and I I'm not having

1886.919 --> 1893.44
it

1888.6 --> 1893.4399999999998
I don't care who he is last

1898.76 --> 1901.97
[Music]

1914.12 --> 1919.84
warning right so yeah there's a lot of

1916.24 --> 1919.84
Transformations happening out there

1921.399 --> 1929.6
and potentially with me as

1925.44 --> 1932.44
well some of it is a little bit

1929.6 --> 1932.4399999999998
disturbing to

1937.08 --> 1944.4399999999998
me you know when you're not wanted yeah

1940.12 --> 1947.5189999999998
that's right that's good that you know

1944.44 --> 1950.919
that that that saves other people the

1947.519 --> 1950.919
trouble of kicking you

1957.399 --> 1964.6
out I appreciate the visit and all I

1960.039 --> 1964.6
don't appreciate just the never ending

1967.279 --> 1972.519
rambling yeah you're basically putting

1970.279 --> 1972.519
my

1975.24 --> 1979.76
other

1976.84 --> 1981.399
regulars

1979.76 --> 1984.279
hello David

1981.399 --> 1985.9189999999999
Banner don't tell me to relax I will

1984.279 --> 1988.96
kick you all the [ __ ] out if you don't

1985.919 --> 1988.96
settle down right

1992.48 --> 1997.2
now yes I would prefer you leave

1997.399 --> 2004.0
then stop spamming in my damn chat I'm

2000.919 --> 2004.0
[ __ ] sick of it

2006.76 --> 2009.76
already

2011.47 --> 2019.099
[Music]

2021.039 --> 2027.72
would I prefer you leave then yes leave

2024.44 --> 2027.72
get the [ __ ] out of my

2028.89 --> 2037.96
[Music]

2035.0 --> 2041.159
chat go spam some other forum or

2037.96 --> 2041.159
whatever this is not the

2046.82 --> 2049.95
[Music]

2060.0 --> 2065.919
place if you have something

2063.359 --> 2068.879
actually information oriented or

2065.919 --> 2073.5989999999997
interesting to say then by all means

2068.879 --> 2073.5989999999997
don't spam my chat like a bunch of

2073.919 --> 2078.2799999999997
hooligans bunch of goof UPS yeah it's a

2076.96 --> 2081.079
waste of

2078.28 --> 2083.28
space and you're literally keeping other

2081.079 --> 2085.5600000000004
people out of my chat that way I don't

2083.28 --> 2085.5600000000004
want

2087.159 --> 2094.879
that how do solar eclipses work uh good

2092.079 --> 2096.4
question aan R how do they

2094.879 --> 2099.839
work

2096.4 --> 2103.04
uh there a Celestial

2099.839 --> 2106.44
event and among the greatest greater

2103.04 --> 2106.44
mysteries in the world

2113.16 --> 2120.52
arguably like how

2117.119 --> 2124.28
the apparent Shadow Works in that

2120.52 --> 2127.92
angular setting is like quite baffling

2124.28 --> 2130.7200000000003
of just been thinking like would be very

2127.92 --> 2130.7200000000003
interesting to

2131.0 --> 2135.28
like hard shut the [ __ ]

2142.92 --> 2150.6800000000003
up hey rosi good to see

2147.079 --> 2153.319
you an actual

2150.68 --> 2155.52
person doesn't just Spam the [ __ ] out of

2153.319 --> 2155.52
the

2156.64 --> 2159.64
place

2160.24 --> 2166.56
but yeah it is especially when you

2163.24 --> 2170.1189999999997
consider like my idea about the

2166.56 --> 2171.599
celestials being non-local holographic

2170.119 --> 2174.319
angular

2171.599 --> 2176.7200000000003
manifestations then a the eclipse

2174.319 --> 2178.2799999999997
especially the solar eclipse is like

2176.72 --> 2181.5989999999997
quite

2178.28 --> 2183.7200000000003
baffling when I'm like in

2181.599 --> 2186.2400000000002
wonderment in the first instance in

2183.72 --> 2190.0789999999997
wonderment like hey how about an Icarus

2186.24 --> 2193.68
project right let's see if you could

2190.079 --> 2197.44
somehow fly into the

2193.68 --> 2201.24
sun I can't fully exclude that it's

2197.44 --> 2203.56
possible but from everything I've seen

2201.24 --> 2206.5989999999997
thus far all the information gathered

2203.56 --> 2210.48
that wouldn't be possible

2206.599 --> 2212.92
because it wouldn't have an actual

2210.48 --> 2215.56
position

2212.92 --> 2218.7200000000003
but with the

2215.56 --> 2222.48
eclipse it gets even way

2218.72 --> 2227.8799999999997
weirder because what is then blocking

2222.48 --> 2227.88
the angular manifestation or appears

2229.319 --> 2235.8
to right it's already weird enough when

2232.68 --> 2238.72
a cloud blocks the Sun and then maybe

2235.8 --> 2241.1600000000003
causes crepuscular rays that you can

2238.72 --> 2244.8799999999997
only see from a certain vantage point if

2241.16 --> 2247.1189999999997
you look at that same vant at that same

2244.88 --> 2249.8
place where the corpuscular Rays would

2247.119 --> 2252.119
be seen from another location they

2249.8 --> 2255.319
wouldn't be there but like with the

2252.119 --> 2259.92
solar eclipse it's like

2255.319 --> 2259.92
what how does that work could you

2261.0 --> 2267.52
like move towards

2264.56 --> 2270.2
it like during the eclipse there is

2267.52 --> 2272.88
footage of solar eclipse from an

2270.2 --> 2276.2799999999997
airplane which was already like

2272.88 --> 2279.319
whoa what is

2276.28 --> 2282.1600000000003
that but but I just wonder what would it

2279.319 --> 2284.72
be like if you'd actually like fly

2282.16 --> 2284.72
towards

2287.839 --> 2296.96
it and what if you like fly very high up

2292.359 --> 2299.44
and you fly very fast like really super

2296.96 --> 2303.52
fast

2299.44 --> 2307.16
like speed of sound and Beyond

2303.52 --> 2309.48
fast would you like really see a some

2307.16 --> 2313.52
sort of of apparent dis

2309.48 --> 2316.52
shift with the sun would you see

2313.52 --> 2316.52
that

2316.8 --> 2323.96
right it's just very mysterious and I

2320.8 --> 2323.96
can't really explain

2329.0 --> 2333.4
it what I do know for certain is that

2331.599 --> 2336.44
it's certainly not the

2333.4 --> 2339.28
moon getting in front of

2336.44 --> 2340.96
it

2339.28 --> 2343.6400000000003
close enough to see the next one April

2340.96 --> 2343.64
8th

2350.24 --> 2356.359
cool wow they all

2352.839 --> 2356.359
left Jesus

2356.64 --> 2360.1189999999997
Christ peace and

2366.359 --> 2369.359
quiet

2375.81 --> 2378.88
[Music]

2392.92 --> 2398.76
a swarm of bugs that just came in

2396.079 --> 2401.92
like ah

2398.76 --> 2405.5200000000004
spamming up the place get

2401.92 --> 2409.56
out I mean you probably don't mean any

2405.52 --> 2409.56
harm it's just really

2410.319 --> 2415.68
annoying chillster good people I'm sure

2413.28 --> 2418.0
they are they didn't sound like evil or

2415.68 --> 2419.7599999999998
anything it just spammed up my chat and

2418.0 --> 2424.48
I did not appreciate

2419.76 --> 2424.48
that so I didn't ban them all

2426.319 --> 2429.319
right

2441.22 --> 2447.7999999999997
[Music]

2444.079 --> 2447.8
right anyway that was

2454.86 --> 2459.2400000000002
[Music]

2456.24 --> 2459.24
weird

2469.08 --> 2472.469
[Music]

2485.96 --> 2491.96
I got a weird email from

2488.88 --> 2498.6800000000003
buckbuster with

2491.96 --> 2498.68
a photograph of the ISS with supposed

2500.2 --> 2507.52
docking I'm

2503.079 --> 2511.96
just not buying it at

2507.52 --> 2511.96
all he really made work of that

2516.24 --> 2521.359
[ __ ] animated gift

2523.88 --> 2530.48
really

2525.96 --> 2534.92
wow he actually believes that

2530.48 --> 2534.92
[ __ ] let me share the animated

2540.72 --> 2546.1189999999997
gift this

2543.559 --> 2549.119
is can't be

2546.119 --> 2549.119
serious

2556.28 --> 2561.48
so this is according to buckbuster from

2559.119 --> 2564.319
a friend of his with Incredible

2561.48 --> 2566.28
telescope who has seen the

2564.319 --> 2570.0
docking it's

2566.28 --> 2570.0
just absolutely

2574.76 --> 2580.96
[ __ ] I mean

2577.96 --> 2580.96
Lon

2588.96 --> 2593.48
no why is it so difficult

2594.0 --> 2598.72
eclipses what do you mean hey

2601.52 --> 2606.119
doons just one person with multiple

2603.92 --> 2608.28
accounts I doubt it Nathan

2606.119 --> 2609.839
are

2608.28 --> 2613.079
I think they're just like a group of

2609.839 --> 2615.24
people that just like always hang around

2613.079 --> 2615.2400000000002
each

2621.52 --> 2628.2
other that's like there's just guys out

2625.2 --> 2633.0789999999997
there that like they just always hang

2628.2 --> 2636.04
together everywhere they go They're

2633.079 --> 2639.04
yeah lesser individuals you could call

2636.04 --> 2639.04
them

2640.319 --> 2642.8
group

2644.16 --> 2649.04
guys and I see these guys like hang

2646.92 --> 2651.96
around other chats

2649.04 --> 2653.4
too I think I recognize most of them

2651.96 --> 2656.4
from

2653.4 --> 2659.88
Dell's and Dell's chat is like spamming

2656.4 --> 2663.119
all over the place man it's like very

2659.88 --> 2664.8
quick but it's it's mostly nonsense they

2663.119 --> 2667.6400000000003
don't really talk about anything it's

2664.8 --> 2671.1600000000003
just blah blah blah

2667.64 --> 2671.16
silly jokes and that's

2672.74 --> 2675.7599999999998
[Music]

2696.04 --> 2700.52
it

2698.16 --> 2703.319
right but did Gary do

2700.52 --> 2705.559
music what do you mean why is it so

2703.319 --> 2705.5589999999997
difficult

2717.4 --> 2722.119
eclipses I mean if you use your

2719.8 --> 2723.8
physicality assumption bias and you just

2722.119 --> 2726.599
assume like oh

2723.8 --> 2727.88
that's that's the sun being blocked out

2726.599 --> 2730.6800000000003
by a

2727.88 --> 2733.839
Planet like if you regard it from a

2730.68 --> 2738.04
heliocentric perspective then yeah it's

2733.839 --> 2738.04
very easy to get a grasp

2738.48 --> 2745.2
on it's very easy to imagine

2742.079 --> 2747.04
then but if you realize that that's

2745.2 --> 2751.319
definitely not the

2747.04 --> 2753.599
case you don't live in an outer space

2751.319 --> 2755.599
universe and the sun is not a giant ball

2753.599 --> 2759.76
of fire that is definitely not being

2755.599 --> 2761.1600000000003
blocked out by a moon moon a rock that

2759.76 --> 2763.3590000000004
gets in

2761.16 --> 2765.72
between because that would definitely

2763.359 --> 2770.2
not create an UNR

2765.72 --> 2773.48
numra like what the Practical result is

2770.2 --> 2773.48
is quite

2775.8 --> 2783.4
surreal it's literally the only example

2779.8 --> 2785.92
ever in which a supposed object blocking

2783.4 --> 2787.44
out a light

2785.92 --> 2790.319
creates

2787.44 --> 2794.52
well the type of Shadow play that we

2790.319 --> 2794.52
experience it's the only example

2815.839 --> 2818.839
ever

2820.2 --> 2823.2999999999997
[Music]

2824.319 --> 2828.64
and saton Link yeah I know they're

2828.72 --> 2831.72
satoon

2844.079 --> 2849.079
surely and I shared the link I don't

2846.72 --> 2852.839
know was it yesterday or the day before

2849.079 --> 2855.079
of like another supposed Chinese spy

2852.839 --> 2858.119
balloon which was literally like a

2855.079 --> 2859.88
satellite hanging from a giant balloon

2858.119 --> 2863.359
that photograph

2859.88 --> 2866.04
remember I shared that so they're out

2863.359 --> 2866.04
there for

2866.2 --> 2871.1189999999997
certainly I'm not denying that I'm just

2869.319 --> 2875.839
saying these

2871.119 --> 2878.839
supposed ISS sightings are not

2875.839 --> 2878.839
that

2882.04 --> 2887.04
and you could speculate what it is but

2884.599 --> 2890.8
it just gets really convoluted at some

2887.04 --> 2893.44
point it gets kind of nutty and

2890.8 --> 2896.48
conspiratorial does it make it not

2893.44 --> 2899.28
true but let's just

2896.48 --> 2901.44
say familiar with yes I am familiar with

2899.28 --> 2901.44
q

2905.76 --> 2908.76
andv

2912.0 --> 2918.04
yeah Richard why because it wouldn't

2914.839 --> 2921.44
work with that extreme

2918.04 --> 2923.44
contrast yeah it wouldn't have a a

2921.44 --> 2925.839
darkened Dot and then a

2923.44 --> 2929.2000000000003
whole big

2925.839 --> 2930.92
circle of partially dark and that's not

2929.2 --> 2933.9199999999996
how that works that's

2930.92 --> 2936.319
not like with the

2933.92 --> 2939.76
distances that are supposedly there that

2936.319 --> 2942.48
makes absolutely no sense

2939.76 --> 2944.0400000000004
whatsoever it really doesn't I don't

2942.48 --> 2948.0
care to argue for

2944.04 --> 2950.88
it yeah save it until the

2948.0 --> 2952.599
whole solar eclipse happen and then all

2950.88 --> 2954.1600000000003
the Ballers can come out and squirt

2952.599 --> 2956.76
about it again and then you can just

2954.16 --> 2959.44
join them I'm not going to have that

2956.76 --> 2959.44
discussion with

2959.799 --> 2965.72
you happened uh plenty of times in the

2962.92 --> 2968.7200000000003
past and I'm tired of

2965.72 --> 2968.72
it

2974.52 --> 2979.2
claims YouTube Flats ignore observable

2977.559 --> 2982.2000000000003
data of the

2979.2 --> 2982.2
celestials

2984.28 --> 2987.28
okay

2991.88 --> 3001.0
whatever right but I mean you could go

2995.64 --> 3003.72
with the supposed is citing that it is a

3001.0 --> 3003.72
holographic

3005.559 --> 3009.6800000000003
projection that it might even

3012.44 --> 3017.079
be

3014.16 --> 3021.92
like a

3017.079 --> 3021.92
satoon that is literally projecting

3023.04 --> 3027.359
it at a consistent

3025.64 --> 3030.319
rate

3027.359 --> 3032.96
that the saton would be in a certain

3030.319 --> 3036.2799999999997
windream and that it projects

3032.96 --> 3039.04
it underneath it or even above it but

3036.28 --> 3043.52
probably underneath

3039.04 --> 3043.52
it and that that is what you get to pick

3048.88 --> 3053.0
up I don't know what you're talking

3050.799 --> 3053.0
about

3055.64 --> 3058.64
duper

3083.799 --> 3089.48
balloons no good as they blow around

3085.599 --> 3091.839
with the wind no no that's not true at

3089.48 --> 3093.64
all cuz if it's high up enough there is

3091.839 --> 3098.48
no wind like that there's

3093.64 --> 3101.319
only wind streams that are consistent

3098.48 --> 3104.119
there's no

3101.319 --> 3107.7599999999998
continual pressure changes like at the

3104.119 --> 3110.119
ground level where things change around

3107.76 --> 3113.0400000000004
regularly there's things evaporate

3110.119 --> 3118.119
there's heat all kinds of things

3113.04 --> 3121.799
happening that makes the wind unstable

3118.119 --> 3123.7200000000003
but up there there are apparently just

3121.799 --> 3127.68
continual wind

3123.72 --> 3131.1189999999997
streams very high up and they just

3127.68 --> 3134.359
flow and they just keep flowing like One

3131.119 --> 3136.76
Direction and then another Direction

3134.359 --> 3139.52
like that that's up there they call it

3136.76 --> 3141.2400000000002
the wind streams and they are very

3139.52 --> 3144.319
[Music]

3141.24 --> 3148.52
stable how do they get them in

3144.319 --> 3148.52
position uh

3150.48 --> 3154.52
with the

3151.799 --> 3156.24
right yeah how do you get weather

3154.52 --> 3157.92
balloons up there in the right position

3156.24 --> 3161.3999999999996
you have to have the right

3157.92 --> 3163.64
ratio of helium or hydrogen that they

3161.4 --> 3165.7200000000003
use with the like the it has to have the

3163.64 --> 3169.799
right

3165.72 --> 3169.799
density and then they just let it

3170.799 --> 3176.04
up and then if their calculations are

3173.359 --> 3179.2799999999997
correct it will basically stop moving

3176.04 --> 3181.52
further up at the right height in the

3179.28 --> 3181.52
right

3186.079 --> 3191.599
windream the point of satellites are

3188.92 --> 3193.88
they mapped out every yeah that's not

3191.599 --> 3196.4
what they really use satellites for for

3193.88 --> 3199.599
mapping they use it for

3196.4 --> 3203.1600000000003
telecommunication mostly

3199.599 --> 3204.92
now supposedly even though there's

3203.16 --> 3208.52
basically ground

3204.92 --> 3210.96
Towers there is no wind up there how do

3208.52 --> 3210.96
you know

3218.68 --> 3227.8799999999997
that I mean even airplanes are set to

3221.88 --> 3227.88
use the wind streams so I dispute that

3231.839 --> 3236.04
clearly they have to go through winds to

3234.44 --> 3238.44
get to the right height yeah of course

3236.04 --> 3238.44
they do

3241.0 --> 3245.92
isn't that done for under cables also

3244.96 --> 3248.92
for

3245.92 --> 3248.92
certain

3248.96 --> 3255.88
derer the thing is

3252.4 --> 3258.2000000000003
it they do have cables but yeah I mean

3255.88 --> 3260.359
the cables don't lead

3258.2 --> 3263.0789999999997
everywhere

3260.359 --> 3265.359
and I mean even like the idea of star

3263.079 --> 3269.319
link and all that is that you could just

3265.359 --> 3271.72
send it a place and then have quick

3269.319 --> 3274.96
connection

3271.72 --> 3274.9599999999996
upward that's

3277.28 --> 3284.0
it PL have engines what the hell does

3281.16 --> 3284.0
that have to do with

3295.319 --> 3298.319
anything

3306.359 --> 3316.319
% Communications done by undera cables

3310.88 --> 3316.319
yeah what's the point a satellite uh

3318.24 --> 3322.52
well in in

3320.839 --> 3325.4
land

3322.52 --> 3327.559
sometimes radio towers don't reach

3325.4 --> 3330.359
certain spots

3327.559 --> 3332.2000000000003
CU Hills get in the way and you don't

3330.359 --> 3333.799
necessarily want to have cables

3332.2 --> 3336.3999999999996
everywhere especially right through a

3333.799 --> 3339.0389999999998
forest and all that because

3336.4 --> 3342.559
that'll like over time damage it Roots

3339.039 --> 3343.559
will like start damaging the cables so

3342.559 --> 3348.2400000000002
that's

3343.559 --> 3348.2400000000002
why it's just an extra Bit Of

3355.24 --> 3358.24
Reach

3361.64 --> 3364.64
that

3364.88 --> 3367.88
what

3371.88 --> 3380.559
wow Jesus you imagine sitting in that

3377.2 --> 3380.5589999999997
thing that's

3385.24 --> 3388.24
terrifying

3406.319 --> 3410.079
interesting link though thanks for that

3415.24 --> 3418.24
clear

3445.16 --> 3448.16
oh

3457.76 --> 3464.2000000000003
right now we're in I'm going to turn on

3460.52 --> 3466.44
my coffee and kind hungry too so it be

3464.2 --> 3466.4399999999996
right

3475.119 --> 3478.119
back

3560.24 --> 3565.16
will the sun really burn if you get

3562.48 --> 3568.48
close enough to it or is it just a mid

3565.16 --> 3572.3999999999996
well thus far it's just a myth

3568.48 --> 3576.2
duper but I mean I don't think anybody

3572.4 --> 3580.2400000000002
has actually ever tested it or if they

3576.2 --> 3583.3999999999996
did it must have been in a far far

3580.24 --> 3587.0
past that has been completely erased

3583.4 --> 3589.44
from us a history that literally no

3587.0 --> 3589.44
longer

3590.119 --> 3596.559
exists but I proposed to do an inchorus

3593.68 --> 3598.839
test to try it out it's like like why

3596.559 --> 3602.799
don't we actually test it

3598.839 --> 3605.44
out can you approach the

3602.799 --> 3607.7599999999998
sun why don't you just fly straight

3605.44 --> 3611.4
forward to it

3607.76 --> 3615.92
right like in any form with a

3611.4 --> 3617.88
rocket with a high altitude balloon with

3615.92 --> 3621.4
who knows whatever they have an

3617.88 --> 3624.079
electrostatic driven craft a metal

3621.4 --> 3627.48
sphere or something those weird things

3624.079 --> 3631.0
that are kind of now seen as

3627.48 --> 3633.44
UFOs like anything like how about trying

3631.0 --> 3636.2
to approach the

3633.44 --> 3639.0
Sun and then see what

3636.2 --> 3642.72
happens it might also be that as you

3639.0 --> 3647.839
approach it it literally

3642.72 --> 3650.3999999999996
just disappears like it just it's gone

3647.839 --> 3653.0389999999998
you go towards it and poof it's just

3650.4 --> 3656.7200000000003
gone right

3653.039 --> 3660.0
that's the idea of the angular manif

3656.72 --> 3662.68
like it's not actually an object the

3660.0 --> 3666.24
light is originating

3662.68 --> 3666.24
from it's a

3666.44 --> 3674.559
hologram that's part of my idea about it

3670.4 --> 3678.039
that's what I suspect it is but

3674.559 --> 3680.559
yeah don't really have any direct

3678.039 --> 3684.559
evidence to back it other

3680.559 --> 3686.8390000000004
than the elusive information about

3684.559 --> 3690.4
angular size increase with

3686.839 --> 3692.5589999999997
approach the infer Square law of light

3690.4 --> 3695.4
obviously not

3692.559 --> 3697.8390000000004
applying that kind of thing

3695.4 --> 3699.119
like that's the evidence that kind of

3697.839 --> 3704.16
backs my

3699.119 --> 3708.039
assertion but it's no definitive

3704.16 --> 3708.0389999999998
proof it remains a

3712.079 --> 3720.599
mystery and an Icarus project would

3716.52 --> 3720.599
like kind of help figure out the

3721.24 --> 3726.359
mystery play flying through the moon

3724.4 --> 3729.359
okay

3726.359 --> 3729.359
new

3735.92 --> 3738.92
really

3744.839 --> 3747.839
what

3748.97 --> 3752.7599999999998
[Music]

3758.25 --> 3761.51
[Music]

3763.44 --> 3768.559
well duper I'm pretty sure that that

3765.039 --> 3771.48
plan flying through the moon was an

3768.559 --> 3773.799
observation from ground level so it's

3771.48 --> 3776.799
like from the ground level yeah who

3773.799 --> 3778.559
knows maybe you see any airplane flying

3776.799 --> 3781.88
like towards the moon and then suddenly

3778.559 --> 3784.3190000000004
like disappearing into it but that's

3781.88 --> 3787.2400000000002
because of the ground

3784.319 --> 3789.92
view pretty damn sure that airplane did

3787.24 --> 3793.359
not like see oh the moon approaching oh

3789.92 --> 3793.359
oh we went through it yeah

3794.799 --> 3798.72
no or

3799.079 --> 3802.4
cartoon I don't

3804.76 --> 3809.92
know if that was a cartoon duper if

3808.359 --> 3812.119
you're [ __ ] around with me I'm going

3809.92 --> 3813.599
to be very pissed off because this is a

3812.119 --> 3815.88
very serious

3813.599 --> 3819.88
discussion

3815.88 --> 3823.1600000000003
don't pull in cartoon

3819.88 --> 3823.1600000000003
references that's

3824.92 --> 3829.88
insulting good not that cartoon right

3832.039 --> 3837.279
so yeah it's trolling might

3834.72 --> 3838.52
be

3837.279 --> 3841.839
very

3838.52 --> 3841.839
funny not

3844.4 --> 3847.599
[Music]

3851.319 --> 3855.839
really hello by the way clutch good to

3853.64 --> 3855.839
see

3864.72 --> 3867.72
you

3878.92 --> 3882.139
[Music]

3884.079 --> 3886.48
hello

3887.92 --> 3891.88

Johnson after that one time I accused

4062.72 --> 4069.24
him for a bit but he like left I haven't

4065.599 --> 4069.2400000000002
seen him since kind of sad about

4072.88 --> 4078.76
it I did figure it out quite quickly

4075.72 --> 4078.7599999999998
after that I was

4104.44 --> 4107.44
mistaken

4123.159 --> 4126.159
I hope he's still out

4134.44 --> 4137.44
there

4143.52 --> 4149.0

hey a man go with good to see

4254.239 --> 4257.239
you

4258.0 --> 4262.04
Billy BFF bear good to see

4263.08 --> 4269.96
you I don't care about the football

4265.96 --> 4269.96
there's no talking about football in my

4284.239 --> 4287.239
chat

4295.52 --> 4302.040000000001
yeah that makes no sense mtrc Angel

4298.76 --> 4308.08
spoon is not a physical

4302.04 --> 4308.08
object it's a MAG an alleged magnetic

4308.12 --> 4313.84
phenomenon that I suspect causes the

4314.239 --> 4319.5199999999995
tides

4315.84 --> 4319.52
you can't catch

4321.639 --> 4326.32
it you might be able to measure

4323.84 --> 4326.32
something

4328.12 --> 4333.599999999999
though a magnetic field of some kind

4330.88 --> 4333.6
something like

4334.0 --> 4339.199
that little Loop lcut see

4344.159 --> 4347.159
you

4350.85 --> 4353.9890000000005
[Music]

4362.52 --> 4366.409000000001
[Music]

4374.12 --> 4377.12
for

4401.92 --> 4406.4
water does not stick to a magnet yeah

4404.32 --> 4408.48
but water can definitely be in

4406.4 --> 4410.92
especially salt

4408.48 --> 4414.879999999999
water it's not about sticking to a

4410.92 --> 4417.1990000000005
magnet it's about being

4414.88 --> 4420.400000000001
influenced by

4417.199 --> 4420.4
magnetism and

4420.52 --> 4426.56
electricity that's what that idea is

4426.8 --> 4430.6
about right if you take hello Rich G

4429.52 --> 4433.6
good see

4430.6 --> 4440.92
you if you

4433.6 --> 4444.84
see the TI's map it literally looks like

4440.92 --> 4448.1990000000005
there's a spoon stirring it locally and

4444.84 --> 4448.1990000000005
that's why I called it Angel

4453.71 --> 4456.92
[Music]

4463.0 --> 4470.44
spoons this is why earth going a magnet

4466.36 --> 4473.599999999999
with water sticking to it

4470.44 --> 4475.599999999999
uh though not really a man go I mean

4473.6 --> 4477.04
there's plenty of other reasons why that

4475.6 --> 4481.280000000001
can't

4477.04 --> 4483.8
be right first and foremost second La

4481.28 --> 4486.599999999999
thermodynamics and you can't have like

4483.8 --> 4488.84
gas pressure next to a vacuum especially

4486.6 --> 4491.96
that size that's

4488.84 --> 4494.56
crazy it would immediately disperse and

4491.96 --> 4497.44
hey guess what happens it to water when

4494.56 --> 4500.0
you sub subjected to low

4497.44 --> 4502.28
pressure yeah it

4500.0 --> 4505.199
evaporates

4502.28 --> 4509.199
rapidly it turns into water vapor and

4505.199 --> 4511.879999999999
then explodes off in the outer space in

4509.199 --> 4511.879999999999
the available

4512.6 --> 4518.0
volume spoon stirring it that's a f yeah

4515.92 --> 4520.8
exactly mang go that's why I chose it

4518.0 --> 4523.92
Angel spoons it's just a

4520.8 --> 4526.1990000000005
word right and oh might be people

4523.92 --> 4529.4
triggering it I don't give a [ __ ] man I

4526.199 --> 4531.5599999999995
don't care if it [ __ ] triggers you

4529.4 --> 4535.12
I'm calling it Angel

4531.56 --> 4536.719
spoons it's a magnetic or seemingly

4535.12 --> 4539.239
magnetic

4536.719 --> 4541.88
phenomenon that causes these

4539.239 --> 4544.5599999999995
Tides right

4541.88 --> 4548.2390000000005
Angels stir the

4544.56 --> 4550.159000000001
ocean twice or three times a day

4548.239 --> 4553.4
depending on the location and it just

4550.159 --> 4557.199
keeps happening like they're all like oh

4553.4 --> 4560.04
that's tea time time the tides is like

4557.199 --> 4565.12
tea time for the

4560.04 --> 4565.12
angels and I go let's stir the

4574.07 --> 4577.228999999999
[Music]

4583.92 --> 4589.399

4613.84 --> 4616.84
that

4628.719 --> 4634.76
right

4630.88 --> 4639.84
but yeah I mean a man go just the whole

4634.76 --> 4639.84
idea like there's all these weird

4639.92 --> 4644.88
inconsistencies

4641.679 --> 4645.96
about just the physical nature of what's

4644.88 --> 4649.4800000000005
what going

4645.96 --> 4652.8
on within the heliocentric claim

4649.48 --> 4654.599999999999
even right supposed molten iron core

4652.8 --> 4659.52
well how can anything

4654.6 --> 4663.84
molten cause a magnetic field it can't

4659.52 --> 4667.88
magnetic field is specifically a a

4663.84 --> 4671.159000000001
solid like it comes forth from solid

4667.88 --> 4673.2390000000005
things like exclusively electromagnets

4671.159 --> 4675.799999999999
too like you can Electrify whatever you

4673.239 --> 4679.32
like if it's not solid it's not going to

4675.8 --> 4682.360000000001
creat create that electromagnetic

4679.32 --> 4686.639
field and then there is the Earth's

4682.36 --> 4689.799999999999
magnetic field which is absurdly

4686.639 --> 4692.88
little yet it's

4689.8 --> 4696.1990000000005
everywhere it is an absurdly little

4692.88 --> 4699.92
amount of magnetism that is

4696.199 --> 4704.48
everywhere that is just really

4699.92 --> 4707.8
strange like if it's everywhere well

4704.48 --> 4710.678999999999
then it must have quite the range right

4707.8 --> 4713.0
how could it be so little then and why

4710.679 --> 4715.96
is there no origin

4713.0 --> 4718.36
point where you're going and oh the mag

4715.96 --> 4722.159
the Earth magnetic Field's getting

4718.36 --> 4724.799999999999
stronger no it's just weak and it's weak

4722.159 --> 4725.638999999999
everywhere but it is everywhere and that

4724.8 --> 4727.8
just

4725.639 --> 4730.92
contradicts our

4727.8 --> 4733.0
very understanding of

4730.92 --> 4734.92
magnetism and we're right in it yeah

4733.0 --> 4737.0
it's another big mystery it's just it's

4734.92 --> 4739.96
like oh the celestial lights yeah they

4737.0 --> 4743.719
completely defy our understand of light

4739.96 --> 4746.52
yet we live in it oh the Earth magnetic

4743.719 --> 4748.679
field yeah completely defies our

4746.52 --> 4751.1990000000005
understanding of magnetism yet we're

4748.679 --> 4751.1990000000005
born in

4751.88 --> 4757.6
it am I

4754.96 --> 4759.96
right it's all very

4757.6 --> 4762.1990000000005
weird once you really start to think

4759.96 --> 4762.199
about

4763.4 --> 4769.32
it please flying above the sun uh

4774.48 --> 4780.759999999999
what ground has a negative charge in the

4777.36 --> 4780.759999999999
atmos a positive

4781.88 --> 4789.639
charge yeah so they

4785.56 --> 4792.280000000001
say but that charge is like extremely

4789.639 --> 4792.28
little though

4793.639 --> 4796.639
duper

4802.4 --> 4806.96
look for the video what video are you

4805.56 --> 4810.679
looking for

4806.96 --> 4810.679
derer what are you talking

4811.199 --> 4818.0
about oh

4813.56 --> 4818.0
the the plane flying through the

4819.4 --> 4825.92
moon right there's been a lot of

4823.12 --> 4829.04
videos like flat earth related short

4825.92 --> 4831.52
videos a lot of channels that kind of

4829.04 --> 4833.48
stopped a lot of them a lot of those

4831.52 --> 4836.080000000001
channels also got deleted because they

4833.48 --> 4838.638999999999
basically started talk about medical

4836.08 --> 4841.199
stuff and then they got taken down

4838.639 --> 4846.159000000001
including their Flat Earth

4841.199 --> 4851.5199999999995
videos so yeah around

4846.159 --> 4854.719
201 16 17 18 was like a massive Bloom of

4851.52 --> 4856.0
a lot of people doing stuff trying to to

4854.719 --> 4858.8
make Black Swan

4856.0 --> 4861.239
observations filming celestial events

4858.8 --> 4863.76
all these mysterious

4861.239 --> 4864.919999999999
phenomena and a lot of it's gone it's

4863.76 --> 4868.360000000001
just

4864.92 --> 4871.12
gone there might still be those videos

4868.36 --> 4874.239
on people's hard

4871.12 --> 4877.239
drives but they're not on YouTube

4874.239 --> 4877.239
anymore

4880.6 --> 4886.679
unfortunately so

4883.08 --> 4889.4
yeah you had to be there basically and

4886.679 --> 4889.4
I'm glad I

4890.159 --> 4896.599999999999
was and in retrospect I feel kind of sad

4893.36 --> 4900.159
that I didn't like save more of the

4896.6 --> 4903.280000000001
videos I falsely and foolishly assumed

4900.159 --> 4907.92
that they were always just be

4903.28 --> 4907.92
there and I feel very foolish for that

4913.52 --> 4916.52
now

4920.16 --> 4923.389999999999
[Music]

4933.92 --> 4938.679
start

4935.719 --> 4941.32
now well yeah in

4938.679 --> 4943.2390000000005
ways I mean if I'm going to find some

4941.32 --> 4945.28
really good

4943.239 --> 4948.08
evidence I have have already kind of

4945.28 --> 4948.08
started a little

4955.76 --> 4962.159000000001
bit but there's just videos that are

4958.76 --> 4964.84
like being recycled and recycled like oh

4962.159 --> 4966.599999999999
an original video somebody puts it in

4964.84 --> 4969.84
their video and then they're on it like

4966.6 --> 4971.92
oh look at this on video then somebody

4969.84 --> 4974.679
else records that

4971.92 --> 4978.719
video and then tries to take the

4974.679 --> 4981.4800000000005
original from the secondhand one and it

4978.719 --> 4981.4800000000005
all gets a bit

4983.159 --> 4990.199
messy right but the way that I have

4986.12 --> 4994.5199999999995
basically conceived of dealing with it

4990.199 --> 4994.5199999999995
is I just need to remember

4994.679 --> 5000.6
it I'm going but by what I know and I'm

4997.76 --> 5002.52
going to describe by what I know

5000.6 --> 5006.84
unfortunately that means like I'm not

5002.52 --> 5006.84
going to be showing you a lot of

5007.6 --> 5013.320000000001
it but I will go by my own Compass

5017.32 --> 5023.28
metaphysically of what I know that I've

5020.0 --> 5023.28
seen that's

5025.27 --> 5028.379000000001
[Music]

5029.6 --> 5036.4400000000005
it anyway I'm going to take a bite of

5032.12 --> 5036.44
this lill song cheers

5042.04 --> 5045.119
[Music]

5063.32 --> 5066.32
h

5093.32 --> 5096.32
for

5123.32 --> 5126.32
h

5153.239 --> 5156.239
for

5183.239 --> 5186.239
for

5213.239 --> 5216.239
oh

5224.04 --> 5228.96
crazy

5225.36 --> 5228.96
people yeah I don't

5235.32 --> 5238.84
know waste of

5243.119 --> 5246.119
space

5273.119 --> 5277.36
h yeah duper that

5277.84 --> 5285.4800000000005
sucks right but I mean to be

5281.96 --> 5287.679
fair a couple of years ago we didn't

5285.48 --> 5290.599999999999
know that YouTube was going to

5287.679 --> 5293.6
destabilize like it

5290.6 --> 5296.679
did we didn't know

5293.6 --> 5299.2390000000005
that was thought like yeah YouTube is

5296.679 --> 5302.119
like that's the main platform in the

5299.239 --> 5304.839999999999
world it's going to always be there it's

5302.119 --> 5308.48
too big to fail

5304.84 --> 5308.4800000000005
that's what most people

5311.159 --> 5314.719
thought and then suddenly everything

5313.48 --> 5317.199
turned to

5314.719 --> 5319.76
[ __ ] like the

5317.199 --> 5323.5599999999995
Crackdown 2020 happened and like

5319.76 --> 5323.56
everything got really

5324.679 --> 5328.639
different it's a mistake we're all

5327.199 --> 5330.919999999999
unfortunately going to have to learn to

5328.639 --> 5330.92
live

5331.02 --> 5335.92
[Music]

5333.04 --> 5338.979
with

5335.92 --> 5338.979
[Music]

5347.36 --> 5352.96
imagine YouTube becomes censor free for

5350.44 --> 5356.759999999999
a day

5352.96 --> 5356.76
no that's never going to

5357.44 --> 5362.08
happen I think the deleted videos are

5360.04 --> 5366.04
stored

5362.08 --> 5366.04
somewhere yeah

5378.88 --> 5382.36
but not within available

5393.04 --> 5396.04
reach

5417.52 --> 5420.360000000001
dead internet

5420.4 --> 5425.96
theory

5422.96 --> 5425.96
explain

5426.199 --> 5431.4
what do you mean how little information

5427.92 --> 5434.159
is actually archived I mean lots of

5431.4 --> 5434.159
information is

5434.719 --> 5438.679
archive but it does kind of thin out

5437.4 --> 5442.5199999999995
over

5438.679 --> 5448.36
time but there's like a curve to it too

5442.52 --> 5451.4800000000005
I mean the way information can be stored

5448.36 --> 5453.5199999999995
improves so there's more information

5451.48 --> 5454.5199999999995
that comes all the time but at the same

5453.52 --> 5457.400000000001
time there's

5454.52 --> 5459.719
also the way to store it all becomes

5457.4 --> 5459.719
more

5462.8 --> 5470.159000000001
efficient and they might have already

5466.4 --> 5473.638999999999
reached a point where they can like do

5470.159 --> 5473.638999999999
fractal memory

5473.719 --> 5479.88
storage where they could seemingly store

5477.199 --> 5485.239
infinite amount of

5479.88 --> 5487.6
material on a finite amount of storage

5485.239 --> 5491.839999999999
I mean it sounds like science fiction

5487.6 --> 5491.84
but it could be they're already

5494.719 --> 5499.6
there YouTube isn't showing your

5497.08 --> 5499.6
critical

5499.88 --> 5504.2390000000005
messages okay well that all depends what

5502.239 --> 5508.48
kind of words you are using a man go

5504.239 --> 5510.638999999999
with but if you're posting links that

5508.48 --> 5512.839999999999
doesn't work that doesn't work when you

5510.639 --> 5515.84
don't have a

5512.84 --> 5515.84
wrench

5517.64 --> 5520.89
[Music]

5542.84 --> 5545.84
for

5555.92 --> 5561.639
yeah that's correct

5558.679 --> 5564.36
clutch YouTube

5561.639 --> 5566.6
does censor certain words but it's not

5564.36 --> 5566.599999999999
just

5567.44 --> 5573.28
YouTube like a lot of platforms

5570.199 --> 5575.5599999999995
do Rumble seems to be the only one that

5573.28 --> 5578.239
doesn't do it

5575.56 --> 5580.679
you could just say whatever crazy vile

5578.239 --> 5583.239
thing you want on Rumble and then just

5580.679 --> 5583.2390000000005
let it all

5597.36 --> 5600.36
happen

5602.76 --> 5605.76
okay

5621.239 --> 5626.718999999999
weird yeah I guess I'll check it out

5623.36 --> 5630.119
later Richard G I've heard of it before

5626.719 --> 5630.119
never really looked into it

5632.0 --> 5637.119
much I always thought that those kind of

5634.36 --> 5641.9
things are just like

5637.119 --> 5644.159
silly conspiracy goof ideas and all

5641.9 --> 5649.32
[Music]

5644.159 --> 5649.32
that we'll see if this is if it

5653.3 --> 5656.68
[Music]

5662.719 --> 5665.719
is

5679.61 --> 5682.86
[Music]

5692.639 --> 5695.639
all

5699.57 --> 5706.08
[Music]

5701.28 --> 5708.199
right the man go but yeah uh could

5706.08 --> 5710.5599999999995
you try

5708.199 --> 5714.599999999999
to hobo

5710.56 --> 5717.84
code what you think the words were that

5714.6 --> 5717.84
basically were filtered

5722.639 --> 5729.96
out what you were talking

5726.679 --> 5732.4
about because I have no idea what like

5729.96 --> 5735.92
what it is that you mentioned that

5732.4 --> 5735.92
YouTube refused to show

5752.639 --> 5756.719
so

5754.159 --> 5756.719
hey

5770.0 --> 5773.32
deist oh

5779.199 --> 5782.199
really

5782.56 --> 5788.679
wow that word is blocks that is

5792.76 --> 5796.4800000000005
weird that is really

5800.44 --> 5806.4
strange yeah duper yeah I could just see

5808.84 --> 5814.96
it maybe it's the arrangement of the

5812.52 --> 5817.400000000001
sentence

5814.96 --> 5822.04
maybe it's just if you said YouTube

5817.4 --> 5822.04
sucks that that

5829.96 --> 5836.119
specifically well a man go have you

5832.0 --> 5836.119
considered that maybe it was just a chat

5836.639 --> 5842.04
glitch yeah it seems like

5839.48 --> 5844.239
uh I think it might have just been a

5842.04 --> 5848.199
YouTube chat glitch with which happens

5844.239 --> 5850.44
sometimes sometimes it just won't appear

5848.199 --> 5852.28
and some I've had where suddenly it says

5850.44 --> 5857.239
like oh

5852.28 --> 5857.239
error it just won't come up

5861.36 --> 5867.08
so no no that's definitely not the CL

5864.56 --> 5870.76
yeah dip

5867.08 --> 5876.32
[ __ ] not scared of any

5870.76 --> 5876.320000000001
words and he wasn't definitely not using

5889.8 --> 5892.919
[Music]

5894.0 --> 5901.08
that YouTube sucks well it just gets

5897.48 --> 5901.08
weird and glitchy sometimes that is

5902.44 --> 5905.44
all

5908.719 --> 5913.8
I don't really think YouTube sucks I

5910.639 --> 5917.32
mean it's not as cool as it used to be

5913.8 --> 5922.28
though all this Ro

5917.32 --> 5922.28
roboticized automated moderation is just

5925.76 --> 5933.92
terrible and YouTube is clearly not just

5930.679 --> 5937.4800000000005
not at all addressing and ever growing

5933.92 --> 5939.56
troll problem Universal

5937.48 --> 5941.959999999999
trolling they're not addressing they're

5939.56 --> 5943.52
not addressing people making continual

5941.96 --> 5945.92
soccer accounts and

5943.52 --> 5949.0
anything they should have like addressed

5945.92 --> 5951.599
that years ago CU it is a serious

5949.0 --> 5953.199
problem it's a giant burden on content

5951.599 --> 5956.84
makers and they haven't done anything

5953.199 --> 5956.839999999999
about it anything at

5959.85 --> 5964.92
[Music]

5962.36 --> 5966.239
all

5964.92 --> 5971.0
what they should

5966.239 --> 5974.119
do is criminalize it where it's not just

5971.0 --> 5977.639
IP band based but they

5974.119 --> 5980.0
actually that they figure out the

5977.639 --> 5981.88
identity and

5980.0 --> 5986.28
eventually

5981.88 --> 5986.28
like get you like an arrest

5992.32 --> 5995.32
War

6022.32 --> 6027.199
okay

6024.199 --> 6027.199
that's

6027.4 --> 6036.839999999999
weird I'm getting trolled by my own

6031.8 --> 6036.84
dad he basically pocket called

6037.679 --> 6043.639
me what the

6040.92 --> 6046.719
hell that was really

6043.639 --> 6048.400000000001
weird I'm G to have to call them call

6046.719 --> 6052.2390000000005
him about that

6048.4 --> 6055.239
later that was really

6052.239 --> 6055.239
silly

6061.44 --> 6064.598999999999
it's not the first time that's happened

6063.0 --> 6066.96
but that is the first time that's

6064.599 --> 6070.4800000000005
actually happened during my

6066.96 --> 6070.4800000000005
show it's really

6072.94 --> 6076.129999999999
[Music]

6079.28 --> 6085.159
silly YouTube made a new

6081.76 --> 6087.400000000001
layout comments here on the right side

6085.159 --> 6091.08
of the

6087.4 --> 6091.08
what what are you talking

6091.28 --> 6097.119
about is that like a for the mobile

6094.239 --> 6099.48
phone or something because that's not

6097.119 --> 6099.48
what I'm

6099.92 --> 6105.119
seeing it's definitely still on the left

6102.679 --> 6109.599
side and on the right side it's all it's

6105.119 --> 6112.799999999999
the chat and then the recommended

6109.599 --> 6115.119000000001
videos that never end like always more

6112.8 --> 6118.28
videos that will be

6115.119 --> 6122.4
recommended Man by the way since I like

6118.28 --> 6122.4
deleted a whole bunch of

6122.719 --> 6127.679
subscriptions of people that hadn't had

6125.28 --> 6132.719
any activities for a long

6127.679 --> 6135.76
time tons of new types of videos and

6132.719 --> 6137.76
channels have been popping up it really

6135.76 --> 6140.4400000000005
seems to matter like what you're

6137.76 --> 6140.4400000000005
subscribed

6142.0 --> 6147.159
to and

6143.8 --> 6147.159000000001
for what you get

6149.56 --> 6154.639
recommended it's interesting hello by

6151.96 --> 6157.119
the way LSG good to see you man hope

6154.639 --> 6157.119
you're doing

6161.58 --> 6166.84
[Music]

6163.679 --> 6168.4
well heart symbol on the streams you

6166.84 --> 6172.32
mean

6168.4 --> 6175.598999999999
the the heart that goes over the chat

6172.32 --> 6178.96
yeah you can turn that off I turn it off

6175.599 --> 6184.32
cuz it's very annoying gets in the

6178.96 --> 6188.0
way and I mean it's not even that

6184.32 --> 6193.4
bad but it shouldn't be in that spot it

6188.0 --> 6193.4
should be like underneath the

6197.599 --> 6204.599
chat like right next to the chat box

6202.48 --> 6206.239
where you actually actually type it in

6204.599 --> 6211.8
it should be right beside like you have

6206.239 --> 6211.799999999999
a the chat box the add

6212.36 --> 6217.119
emotes the engage with engage with

6215.84 --> 6219.1990000000005
audience

6217.119 --> 6223.199
what start

6219.199 --> 6225.799999999999
poll oh

6223.199 --> 6227.5599999999995
huh and they should have just put it

6225.8 --> 6230.679
right next to

6227.56 --> 6232.88
that but instead they just do it over

6230.679 --> 6235.76
the chat which is really because it's

6232.88 --> 6238.679
it's not just over the chat it's also

6235.76 --> 6242.280000000001
over the spot that you have to click

6238.679 --> 6244.4
when you want to moderate it's extremely

6242.28 --> 6245.92
inconvenient but at least you can turn

6244.4 --> 6248.36
it off

6245.92 --> 6251.1990000000005
so as soon as I figured out you can turn

6248.36 --> 6251.199
it off I turn it

6256.32 --> 6261.159
off yeah not all people yeah my man go a

6259.679 --> 6264.159
lot of people are just

6261.159 --> 6268.36
sloppy they just click go live and they

6264.159 --> 6268.36
don't do anything they don't set

6268.679 --> 6274.52
anything I haven't updated YouTube what

6271.8 --> 6278.88
are you talking about duper YouTube

6274.52 --> 6282.119000000001
doesn't have updates it's a

6278.88 --> 6285.76
browser it's it's a browser

6282.119 --> 6285.759999999999
program it's not an

6289.28 --> 6294.48
app no but duper there's a distinct

6291.88 --> 6300.639
difference between mobile

6294.48 --> 6300.638999999999
phone and regular browser on a desktop

6310.36 --> 6316.92
computer keep wanting to send you code

6314.239 --> 6319.839999999999
by Tex that's weird you should be able

6316.92 --> 6319.84
to turn that off

6321.96 --> 6324.96
though

6347.92 --> 6354.92
huh right but I agree there's

6351.04 --> 6357.76
been with all the updates ups and downs

6354.92 --> 6357.76
it's not

6360.199 --> 6365.598999999999
great they they YouTube team has tried

6363.84 --> 6370.88
to add a lot of

6365.599 --> 6373.679
stuff and not really fix older

6370.88 --> 6375.92
stuff that's problematic and it it looks

6373.679 --> 6378.2390000000005
also like like that's just not going to

6375.92 --> 6378.2390000000005
happen

6378.92 --> 6384.599
anymore probably because if they do that

6382.04 --> 6387.96
they'd have to have like a significant

6384.599 --> 6392.599
transformation that would potentially

6387.96 --> 6392.599
like create a lot of chaos for a lot of

6393.599 --> 6400.76
people and that could like lead to

6396.679 --> 6403.52
YouTube being down effectively for

6400.76 --> 6405.639
weeks right if they'd really want to fix

6403.52 --> 6409.280000000001
it you'd have to dig deep and that like

6405.639 --> 6414.84
leads to massive problems so it seems

6409.28 --> 6414.84
like they've mostly done cosmetic things

6426.92 --> 6434.679
there a laptop

6430.52 --> 6437.8
okay well I don't I can't explain that

6434.679 --> 6441.4
derer I mean a laptop is

6437.8 --> 6445.119000000001
technically exactly the same as a

6441.4 --> 6447.839999999999
PC the only difference is that the

6445.119 --> 6449.04
screen is attached to the computer

6447.84 --> 6452.119000000001
that's

6449.04 --> 6454.56
it and it's more compact it's it's the

6452.119 --> 6454.5599999999995
same

6461.28 --> 6467.4
thing YouTube takes more time to

6465.4 --> 6470.4
load it

6467.4 --> 6470.4
does

6470.52 --> 6476.599
H I have no such ISS

6474.32 --> 6479.719
issues but it might be the browser

6476.599 --> 6481.84
indeed you just have to like try other

6479.719 --> 6484.4800000000005
browsers like I had a lot of trouble

6481.84 --> 6487.04
with Firefox which technically outdated

6484.48 --> 6489.678999999999
but it still works and I just refused to

6487.04 --> 6494.719
stop using it it still works right

6489.679 --> 6497.2390000000005
now right but if it like stopped froze

6494.719 --> 6500.44
my screen which was a typical problem I

6497.239 --> 6500.44
would just go to

6500.8 --> 6504.76
Chrome and use that

6512.88 --> 6516.32
maybe update your browser

6531.719 --> 6534.719
yes

6537.36 --> 6540.239
make sure though if you're going to

6538.84 --> 6543.0
update a browser that hasn't been

6540.239 --> 6545.959999999999
updated for while make sure to first

6543.0 --> 6545.96
save your

6549.239 --> 6556.199
bookmarks because things can go wrong

6552.599 --> 6556.1990000000005
you don't want to lose

6557.92 --> 6561.01
[Music]

6561.719 --> 6564.719
them

6571.08 --> 6577.4
that almost happened to me two days ago

6573.679 --> 6577.4
scared me the hell out of

6578.719 --> 6584.08
me but it's just the menu structure that

6581.639 --> 6588.08
changed which still I'm very frustrated

6584.08 --> 6591.239
about like there was a menu bar at the

6588.08 --> 6593.239
top it just disappeared I don't know

6591.239 --> 6596.44
what the hell happened to it

6593.239 --> 6600.119
and now I have to explore the menu in a

6596.44 --> 6600.119
very convoluted annoying

6601.76 --> 6606.159000000001
way like

6613.33 --> 6617.679
[Music]

6615.199 --> 6619.96
why delete your

6617.679 --> 6624.639
history yeah there's no point to that am

6619.96 --> 6624.639
man go they'll still catch it

6627.159 --> 6632.0
like your computer is not the only place

6629.36 --> 6632.0
that stuff is

6639.599 --> 6643.4800000000005
stored

6640.77 --> 6647.040000000001
[Music]

6643.48 --> 6649.839999999999
yeah it might help if your girlfriend or

6647.04 --> 6651.48
something like checks your history it'll

6649.84 --> 6654.119000000001
help for

6651.48 --> 6656.678999999999
that but but uh yeah the actual

6654.119 --> 6659.759999999999
authorities

6656.679 --> 6665.4800000000005
definitely will have a record of

6659.76 --> 6665.4800000000005
it don't you make any Illusions about

6674.36 --> 6680.32
that what else should I delete no why

6678.0 --> 6684.52
should you delete anything it's too late

6680.32 --> 6687.5599999999995
if you if you put something down it's on

6684.52 --> 6689.079000000001
record and you can't undo the record

6687.56 --> 6691.96
unless you like make a deal with the

6689.079 --> 6694.599
Secret Service to delete

6691.96 --> 6696.079
everything that has any association with

6694.599 --> 6700.400000000001
you from the

6696.079 --> 6700.4
internet wouldn't really want to do that

6709.679 --> 6717.04
though wow okay Timothy k I'm not going

6713.8 --> 6717.04
to go

6717.8 --> 6721.320000000001
there but

6730.84 --> 6734.4800000000005
uh yeah exactly

6741.52 --> 6744.52
clutch

6771.44 --> 6774.44
for

6779.36 --> 6785.28
our VPN is safe as they

6782.28 --> 6785.28
say

6797.8 --> 6805.400000000001
yes but if they figure out who you are

6802.84 --> 6808.079
then they can

6805.4 --> 6810.079
still not through the connection you

6808.079 --> 6813.28
make but through other

6810.079 --> 6816.239
ways get in your

6813.28 --> 6818.239
computer and then you can go anonymously

6816.239 --> 6820.759999999999
do stuff out there but they'll have a

6818.239 --> 6823.959999999999
tag directly at your

6820.76 --> 6828.280000000001
computer but you'll have to like be a

6823.96 --> 6828.28
really naughty boy to get him to do

6831.44 --> 6834.44
that

6838.8 --> 6843.28
aren't you at the mercy of other

6840.079 --> 6846.4
corporations yes yeah they collect the

6843.28 --> 6848.119
metadata they collect your habits they

6846.4 --> 6850.598999999999
make a profile of your habits and

6848.119 --> 6853.839999999999
there's nothing you can do about it

6850.599 --> 6855.1990000000005
except don't go on the internet ever

6853.84 --> 6858.28
that's the only thing you can do about

6855.199 --> 6858.28
it and it's not going to

6858.52 --> 6863.639
happen like even VPN and all that's not

6862.0 --> 6867.48
going to help

6863.639 --> 6870.88
you as long as you register anywhere on

6867.48 --> 6874.718999999999
any website they'll be able to get

6870.88 --> 6874.719
metadata on you and build a

6891.32 --> 6894.32
profile

6902.96 --> 6908.199
before yesterday user profiling is quite

6905.599 --> 6908.1990000000005
accurate

6911.52 --> 6918.4400000000005
yeah it's because they have so much of

6914.56 --> 6920.280000000001
it when you have billions of people and

6918.44 --> 6924.119
their

6920.28 --> 6926.28
metadata through the sheer

6924.119 --> 6929.799999999999
statistical volume of

6926.28 --> 6931.759999999999
it computers that are specifically

6929.8 --> 6933.639
designated to figure it out can

6931.76 --> 6934.719
literally predict anything you're going

6933.639 --> 6938.32
to

6934.719 --> 6938.32
do so they

6938.92 --> 6944.84
say and the accuracy rate of those

6941.679 --> 6947.4
predictions have become quite

6944.84 --> 6951.2390000000005
high but it's tricky because it's not

6947.4 --> 6954.92
Flawless and things can suddenly shift

6951.239 --> 6957.48
change so it's like they can predict

6954.92 --> 6962.36
within a certain field of things

6957.48 --> 6962.36
happening but if things change

6962.4 --> 6968.159
unexpectedly then they don't they have

6964.88 --> 6971.119
to like get a feel again for how things

6968.159 --> 6973.96
respond to that change it's it it

6971.119 --> 6973.96
becomes kind of

6975.8 --> 6981.28
weird but based on what your actions are

6979.44 --> 6982.759999999999
the algorithms that are specifically

6981.28 --> 6985.84
created to

6982.76 --> 6987.8
predict through metadata they can figure

6985.84 --> 6989.719
out like what you're going to do or in

6987.8 --> 6992.679
what direction you're going to do things

6989.719 --> 6995.56
it just does it knows like if you're

6992.679 --> 6997.92
curious about a certain subject it knows

6995.56 --> 7002.079000000001
where you're going to go after

6997.92 --> 7003.8
that because it's compared it with like

7002.079 --> 7007.48
hundreds of

7003.8 --> 7007.4800000000005
millions a billion

7011.239 --> 7014.239
people

7019.239 --> 7023.36
and they can use that for many things

7020.76 --> 7027.0
and first and foremost

7023.36 --> 7027.0
advertising exact

7027.199 --> 7034.28
advertising and secondly to attempt to

7031.36 --> 7037.239
steer you oh or you're getting into this

7034.28 --> 7041.4
subject quickly take a look at this look

7037.239 --> 7043.44
at this specific gatekeeping rabbit hole

7041.4 --> 7045.719
that concerns that subject oh that'll

7043.44 --> 7048.48
draw you in don't go into those other

7045.719 --> 7050.719
Niche stuff that actually like have real

7048.48 --> 7052.799999999999
risky information that's that puts

7050.719 --> 7056.52
everybody at risk of the mega

7052.8 --> 7058.599
corporations right go into that standard

7056.52 --> 7061.320000000001
Rabbit Hole it will be presented right

7058.599 --> 7063.119000000001
in front of you that's also a way they

7061.32 --> 7065.759999999999
use the

7063.119 --> 7070.199
metadata to steer you in your

7065.76 --> 7072.96
exploration they do that I know they do

7070.199 --> 7076.678999999999
I've seen it happen they TR like they do

7072.96 --> 7079.04
that on me and then I like had to like

7076.679 --> 7081.599
oh I got into this subject and then all

7079.04 --> 7083.8
all the recommendation oh oh oh standard

7081.599 --> 7085.360000000001
bull I had to like not interested not

7083.8 --> 7087.0
interested not interested not interested

7085.36 --> 7088.759999999999
not interested I had to like say not

7087.0 --> 7092.56
interested not interested not interest

7088.76 --> 7095.360000000001
for like days before they'd stop trying

7092.56 --> 7097.400000000001
to shove these standardized [ __ ]

7095.36 --> 7100.799999999999
subjects in my

7097.4 --> 7104.0
face because I just got into a certain

7100.8 --> 7106.56
field they do do that they they force

7104.0 --> 7109.28
they try to force railroad

7106.56 --> 7111.4800000000005
you based on the

7109.28 --> 7114.119
metadata they discover you're getting

7111.48 --> 7117.079
into a certain subject and then they try

7114.119 --> 7119.28
to force railroad you in a

7117.079 --> 7124.92
direction from that vantage point they

7119.28 --> 7128.239
do that YouTube does that very overtly

7124.92 --> 7131.079
and they can because it has videos for

7128.239 --> 7134.0
absolutely everything so they can just

7131.079 --> 7136.639
like really real you with the

7134.0 --> 7137.88
recommendations but if you catch on and

7136.639 --> 7140.679
if you like

7137.88 --> 7142.84
specifically like I don't care about

7140.679 --> 7145.88
this don't show this again don't suggest

7142.84 --> 7148.84
this again don't don't no no no no no no

7145.88 --> 7149.88
no then eventually it'll be like oh oh

7148.84 --> 7152.400000000001
oh

7149.88 --> 7155.36
okay we'll leave you

7152.4 --> 7158.48
alone but you have to like actively

7155.36 --> 7160.679
fight it off and say not interested not

7158.48 --> 7162.879999999999
interested not interested otherwise it

7160.679 --> 7166.4400000000005
will keep doing that

7162.88 --> 7169.36
yeah if you like suddenly get into a

7166.44 --> 7172.32
really popular more mainstream Channel

7169.36 --> 7175.48
thing guess what happens all the

7172.32 --> 7177.679
recommendations become that all of it oh

7175.48 --> 7180.919999999999
you want to see more oh you oh oh look

7177.679 --> 7185.4800000000005
we got like 20 more videos that's all

7180.92 --> 7188.04
you're going to see why because it's a

7185.48 --> 7190.638999999999
mainstream thing it makes you're

7188.04 --> 7193.079
[ __ ] that's what it

7190.639 --> 7195.400000000001
wants it wants wants you to get into

7193.079 --> 7197.96
mainstream things and get [ __ ]

7195.4 --> 7201.079
because when you get [ __ ] you become

7197.96 --> 7204.56
more predictable and more easy to

7201.079 --> 7205.4
financially exploit yeah I know how that

7204.56 --> 7208.679
[ __ ]

7205.4 --> 7209.5599999999995
works I've literally unsubscribed from

7208.679 --> 7212.1990000000005
those

7209.56 --> 7214.400000000001
channels because of those [ __ ]

7212.199 --> 7217.28
recommendations that just wouldn't stop

7214.4 --> 7220.0
whining about those specific

7217.28 --> 7222.639
channels I literally unsubscribed

7220.0 --> 7225.04
because of that yeah

7222.639 --> 7226.32
idiot algorithms like look at what

7225.04 --> 7230.36
you're

7226.32 --> 7232.799999999999
doing YouTube you're like ruining people

7230.36 --> 7232.799999999999
with that

7233.88 --> 7241.04
[ __ ] you think that anybody any person

7238.159 --> 7244.04
whatsoever out there in the world likes

7241.04 --> 7246.679
it that when they oh oh cool big Channel

7244.04 --> 7248.88
I'll check it out and then suddenly all

7246.679 --> 7252.159
the recommendations become just that

7248.88 --> 7254.76
[ __ ] Channel you think any living

7252.159 --> 7259.119
person in the world actually appreciates

7254.76 --> 7263.52
that they don't not a single person in

7259.119 --> 7263.5199999999995
the world appreciates that

7268.28 --> 7275.8
idiots it's big mistake big

7272.0 --> 7279.119
mistake and they

7275.8 --> 7283.92
just underestimating how people

7279.119 --> 7283.92
work it's ridiculous that they did that

7290.8 --> 7295.400000000001
nobody sensible gives money away to a

7292.96 --> 7295.4
YouTube

7296.28 --> 7299.28
channel

7300.32 --> 7306.679
maybe unless they really appreciate the

7302.88 --> 7306.679
channel and what they have to

7310.84 --> 7313.84
offer

7320.92 --> 7326.4
can you collectively defund why the hell

7322.84 --> 7329.2390000000005
would you do that hello I'm on

7326.4 --> 7333.36
YouTube could we not talk about taking

7329.239 --> 7333.36
down YouTube a man

7333.719 --> 7340.639
goeth yeah we can address problems

7337.32 --> 7342.36
criticize them why the [ __ ] would I want

7340.639 --> 7345.28
to take down you

7342.36 --> 7347.759999999999
YouTube it's doing a good enough job of

7345.28 --> 7350.5199999999995
that by itself I don't need to

7347.76 --> 7352.360000000001
contribute to

7350.52 --> 7356.159000000001
that

7352.36 --> 7358.759999999999
yeah and I'm here on YouTube with a big

7356.159 --> 7360.96
like Channel with many videos like why

7358.76 --> 7365.84
the [ __ ] would I want to take down

7360.96 --> 7365.84
YouTube I don't want my material to be

7370.84 --> 7373.84
gone

7378.119 --> 7382.5599999999995
some reason they think if you watch a

7379.8 --> 7384.84
certain video we want to see more like

7382.56 --> 7387.119000000001
it they should recommend totally

7384.84 --> 7387.119000000001
different

7392.04 --> 7395.96
ones I don't know why that

7397.0 --> 7404.0
happens funding some of the activities

7399.52 --> 7407.4800000000005
no but is it's called helping to

7404.0 --> 7409.4
give constructive criticism to help

7407.48 --> 7413.28
improve

7409.4 --> 7416.199
YouTube a man go that's what that is and

7413.28 --> 7418.88
I have done that I have given Inc

7416.199 --> 7420.28
content criticism on YouTube during my

7418.88 --> 7422.719
shows

7420.28 --> 7425.199
like since the beginning of the early

7422.719 --> 7427.599
bir shows like it's like hey there's

7425.199 --> 7431.28
something wrong with

7427.599 --> 7433.400000000001
this there's a persistent issue now I

7431.28 --> 7435.88
address it and like complain about H the

7433.4 --> 7438.4
moderation functions like why is it like

7435.88 --> 7441.84
this and they added some I mean now

7438.4 --> 7444.719
there is a channel activity button there

7441.84 --> 7444.719
is extremely

7446.0 --> 7452.4
handy although there's still an issue

7449.239 --> 7452.4
with the timeout

7454.159 --> 7461.04
system it's annoying that if you put

7457.44 --> 7464.799999999999
somebody in a Timeout that all the

7461.04 --> 7467.199
messages in that YouTube stream that

7464.8 --> 7470.96
preceded it get

7467.199 --> 7470.96
removed that's

7475.84 --> 7482.88
annoying what they should do

7479.36 --> 7484.719
is not that just oh you put somebody in

7482.88 --> 7488.84
a Timeout well then they just go in a

7484.719 --> 7488.84
Timeout not all the messages

7489.599 --> 7494.559
removed and you could have another

7492.4 --> 7496.719
function there is like remove all their

7494.559 --> 7500.599
messages like specifically remove

7496.719 --> 7505.0
messages from that YouTube channel in

7500.599 --> 7507.679
the chat as a separate button not as

7505.0 --> 7510.559
standard part of the timeout or even

7507.679 --> 7513.119
hide user from Channel that should be

7510.559 --> 7517.96
the way it is and it hasn't

7513.119 --> 7520.88
been for a decade it's it's a

7517.96 --> 7522.4
waste cuz now you could have a whole

7520.88 --> 7525.599
conversation with somebody the

7522.4 --> 7527.239
conversation goes sour you're like ah I

7525.599 --> 7530.28
I need to shut him up because he's now

7527.239 --> 7533.879999999999
just talking [ __ ] you time him out and

7530.28 --> 7537.4
then the entire conversation is

7533.88 --> 7539.2390000000005
deleted which makes it like oh somebody

7537.4 --> 7540.879999999999
watching that back is going to be like I

7539.239 --> 7542.36
don't know what they're talking about

7540.88 --> 7545.079
what is he addressing there's nothing

7542.36 --> 7548.239
there yeah because when you time him out

7545.079 --> 7554.079
it's all gone it's part of the reason

7548.239 --> 7558.199
why I in yeah why I got a chat in the

7554.079 --> 7561.88
video so that you could still see

7558.199 --> 7566.32
it that's the reason why I have the chat

7561.88 --> 7566.32
on the video specifically because of

7580.559 --> 7585.88
that

7582.679 --> 7589.28
and yeah they should fix

7585.88 --> 7591.96
it oh yeah man have a good lunch thanks

7589.28 --> 7591.96
for the

7610.52 --> 7613.52
conversation

7640.52 --> 7643.52
e

7670.44 --> 7673.44
for

7696.719 --> 7699.28
does this

7700.44 --> 7703.44
work

7706.28 --> 7709.079
did it work on

7730.44 --> 7733.44
on

7760.36 --> 7763.36
what

7785.48 --> 7790.119
think I found out yeah it's

7790.32 --> 7795.639
anyway

7793.32 --> 7797.759999999999
the video says the internet is in a

7795.639 --> 7800.079
stage of automated technological

7797.76 --> 7804.0
cultural

7800.079 --> 7804.0
stagnation maybe Richard

7808.719 --> 7815.52
G but I mean in a way with YouTube it is

7812.4 --> 7819.5199999999995
a problem that it's just so damn

7815.52 --> 7822.719
big because despite its size it's still

7819.52 --> 7824.040000000001
going to need human hum it's going to

7822.719 --> 7827.92
need

7824.04 --> 7830.079
humans and human moderators and all that

7827.92 --> 7832.679
in order to properly function but

7830.079 --> 7836.719
because it's so

7832.679 --> 7840.96
vast it's just like an like a huge

7836.719 --> 7844.04
Empire that's just too big too big to

7840.96 --> 7845.18
manage and that's been a problem for

7844.04 --> 7848.939
YouTube for a

7845.18 --> 7848.939
[Music]

7849.199 --> 7853.48
while it's basically too big to

7855.28 --> 7860.8
manage and that's why they threw it all

7857.559 --> 7862.84
at the algorithms but it doesn't work

7860.8 --> 7865.84
and

7862.84 --> 7865.84
now

7865.96 --> 7872.52
like there's political

7869.0 --> 7876.04
medling which like like really is

7872.52 --> 7879.119000000001
destroying it the political medling is

7876.04 --> 7882.679
destroying YouTube in a very very

7879.119 --> 7884.5199999999995
terrible way it is destroying the the

7882.679 --> 7887.079
real freedom and

7884.52 --> 7890.159000000001
creativity that was

7887.079 --> 7892.799999999999
there what made it great it's destroying

7890.159 --> 7892.799999999999
what made it

7897.199 --> 7902.44
great and really when you think about it

7899.599 --> 7905.8
it's a miracle that that it's still

7902.44 --> 7909.799999999999
there that it's still relatively big

7905.8 --> 7909.8
this yeah despite what they've

7910.239 --> 7913.239
done

7923.079 --> 7927.84
right so yeah I dream of that one day

7925.48 --> 7929.879999999999
YouTube shall be free

7927.84 --> 7932.639
again

7929.88 --> 7936.76
but will it actually be able to handle

7932.639 --> 7938.96
that right could YouTube handle a

7936.76 --> 7942.4400000000005
Resurgence where some's like oh it's

7938.96 --> 7944.44
free again let's go back to YouTube woo

7942.44 --> 7945.558999999999
like could they handle that or would it

7944.44 --> 7948.96
literally

7945.559 --> 7951.52
like and it's just broken like that

7948.96 --> 7953.4800000000005
really broke and then who know I don't

7951.52 --> 7957.119000000001
even

7953.48 --> 7960.239
know I don't know what they're

7957.119 --> 7961.5199999999995
doing I don't know what Google is doing

7960.239 --> 7964.36
with

7961.52 --> 7967.76
YouTube Google doesn't really seem to

7964.36 --> 7967.759999999999
care all that much about

7970.119 --> 7973.119
YouTube

7977.32 --> 7984.88
you Google has mostly been

7979.76 --> 7989.159000000001
just responsible for all this political

7984.88 --> 7989.159000000001
hassle that's them doing it to

8000.119 --> 8003.119
YouTube

8023.08 --> 8028.399
[Music]

8030.04 --> 8033.04
right

8040.159 --> 8043.92
since we're talking so much about

8041.559 --> 8047.159000000001
YouTube thought I'll add that to the

8043.92 --> 8047.159
title why

8060.04 --> 8063.04
not

8073.4 --> 8078.96
at least I feel a lot better than when I

8076.28 --> 8078.96
started out the

8090.04 --> 8093.04
show

8115.119 --> 8119.96
what showed how everyone had unique

8118.719 --> 8122.96
Myspace

8119.96 --> 8122.96
pages

8123.159 --> 8128.219999999999
okay

8125.05 --> 8128.22
[Music]

8137.8 --> 8144.8
what yeah I guess it's about

8141.36 --> 8144.799999999999
customization Rich

8145.76 --> 8152.679
G and it's kind of weird because even

8149.92 --> 8156.559
YouTube

8152.679 --> 8158.599
used to be a lot more customizable I

8156.559 --> 8161.92
think the only thing that's really

8158.599 --> 8165.679
customizable now is like how you order

8161.92 --> 8169.96
the videos and subscription and

8165.679 --> 8169.96
links and the banner at the

8174.96 --> 8179.32
top that's all that's all that's

8179.92 --> 8186.2390000000005
left

8182.36 --> 8188.759999999999
I think you were able capable earlier to

8186.239 --> 8188.759999999999
have more

8189.44 --> 8193.92
detail trying to get at

8203.12 --> 8208.639000000001
yeah well I think that that's it's not

8206.24 --> 8210.88
just like because of technological

8208.639 --> 8215.479
convenience or saving space or whatever

8210.88 --> 8218.518999999998
ever I think that is like part of just a

8215.479 --> 8222.639
cultural strategy it's the

8218.519 --> 8222.639000000001
depersonalization is like a Marxist

8222.76 --> 8228.319
agenda which unfortunately Google is

8225.519 --> 8228.319
very much a part

8231.559 --> 8239.559
of is to basically throw off the notion

8236.16 --> 8239.559
that you have to be

8239.84 --> 8245.319
individualized it's like no no everybody

8243.24 --> 8247.319
has to be equal if you stand out too

8245.319 --> 8249.84
much then you're

8247.319 --> 8251.92
bad and then from the vantage point of

8249.84 --> 8255.479
that

8251.92 --> 8258.2
opinion they make everything generic

8255.479 --> 8260.399
which makes it terrible and unappealing

8258.2 --> 8260.399000000001
and

8261.359 --> 8267.2
depressing and easy to mimic

8264.679 --> 8269.399
because if you're not really unique

8267.2 --> 8271.92
looking then

8269.399 --> 8274.039999999999
somebody can more more

8271.92 --> 8278.28
easily fake

8274.04 --> 8281.960000000001
you and then it's harder to catch up to

8278.28 --> 8284.16
catch on to that they are a fake version

8281.96 --> 8284.16
of

8285.319 --> 8289.639
you the more you're able to personalize

8288.679 --> 8293.28
your

8289.639 --> 8297.399
page the harder it becomes to fake

8293.28 --> 8300.08
you because you can have like tricks on

8297.399 --> 8303.08
how you're personalizing it that others

8300.08 --> 8303.08
wouldn't be able to figure

8305.0 --> 8312.719
out it's like you can literally have

8308.8 --> 8315.719
your own visual code your own visual

8312.719 --> 8315.719
encryption

8318.76 --> 8323.319
stuff it's not a literal encryption it's

8321.479 --> 8325.84
just like everybody will remain

8323.319 --> 8329.119999999999
wondering like how how did they achieve

8325.84 --> 8332.719000000001
this and they won't be able to copy it

8329.12 --> 8332.719000000001
in their mimic of you

8334.439 --> 8340.24
yeah standardize and depersonalize

8336.559 --> 8340.24
everything then that is

8340.8 --> 8349.479
gone and you just give yeah evil people

8345.519 --> 8349.479
and trolls more

8355.04 --> 8361.800000000001
power right but I mean

8358.16 --> 8364.24
look again we're in a Time of growth

8361.8 --> 8367.24
sickness and

8364.24 --> 8367.24
transformation

8368.24 --> 8374.559
The Satanic

8371.84 --> 8378.16
globalists that have been in power very

8374.559 --> 8382.88
prominently for a while now they're

8378.16 --> 8386.719
breaking at the seams right that balloon

8382.88 --> 8391.279999999999
which is very high up is about to pop in

8386.719 --> 8394.039999999999
a big way and when it pops it all like

8391.28 --> 8399.2
really quick it will go

8394.04 --> 8402.2
quickly like how things are will change

8399.2 --> 8402.2
quickly

8402.64 --> 8408.08
and I think that's going to happen like

8405.92 --> 8411.359
maybe even before the summer starts it's

8408.08 --> 8414.96
going to be very quickly it might it

8411.359 --> 8419.399000000001
sounds crazy it might be this

8414.96 --> 8423.24
month I've never had a feeling of

8419.399 --> 8425.88
urgency this strong my entire

8423.24 --> 8427.96
life and I've had quite a few moments

8425.88 --> 8431.319
where I felt urgency no nothing like

8427.96 --> 8433.759999999998
there's like there something like the

8431.319 --> 8435.76
tension is

8433.76 --> 8438.319
just

8435.76 --> 8442.960000000001
incomparable something really about to

8438.319 --> 8445.6
happen that is going to change things

8442.96 --> 8449.64
forever we're not going to see anything

8445.6 --> 8453.16
like this after that in our

8449.64 --> 8454.72
lifetime if we will have any lifetime

8453.16 --> 8457.359
because I don't know what will come with

8454.72 --> 8460.0
the changes could be some dramatic

8457.359 --> 8463.84
situations happening

8460.0 --> 8463.84
including places blowing

8465.52 --> 8471.399000000001
up or like cities suddenly getting wiped

8469.359 --> 8476.359
out I mean it wouldn't be the first time

8471.399 --> 8478.96
you know it's happened in Hawaii Chile

8476.359 --> 8482.399000000001
and now Texas just recently don't know

8478.96 --> 8486.88
if you even noticed that

8482.399 --> 8486.88
it could be in all kinds of

8489.12 --> 8496.76
places so but there's things like really

8493.2 --> 8500.6
unfolding really happening quickly

8496.76 --> 8500.6
balance of power is going to shift it's

8500.8 --> 8505.759999999998
inevitable and then after that it all

8503.16 --> 8509.28
depends like is it going to be a new

8505.76 --> 8511.72
Empire that is just the old Empire but

8509.28 --> 8514.84
without the reputation like the new

8511.72 --> 8517.438999999998
Empire would be like the old Empire but

8514.84 --> 8518.960000000001
then like blame the previous Empire for

8517.439 --> 8522.319
all the damage

8518.96 --> 8524.679999999998
done so that they for a long time don't

8522.319 --> 8527.119999999999
have to do that damage it's already done

8524.68 --> 8529.880000000001
so they can just comfortably take the

8527.12 --> 8532.2
power without immediately taking over

8529.88 --> 8536.24
the curse of everything that's

8532.2 --> 8539.52
happened or it could be a

8536.24 --> 8541.479
genuine switch

8539.52 --> 8543.6
around

8541.479 --> 8546.88
although at this point it's almost like

8543.6 --> 8548.800000000001
it feels foolish to even dream that

8546.88 --> 8551.679999999998
feels foolish to dream like anything

8548.8 --> 8551.679999999998
could ever really

8553.8 --> 8560.358999999999
change but it might and if it does then

8557.16 --> 8562.08
we could expect Mega corporations to

8560.359 --> 8565.92
also get

8562.08 --> 8568.479
tackled it's like the governments they

8565.92 --> 8570.68
if because it's the mega corporations

8568.479 --> 8573.24
that are on top of this corrupted

8570.68 --> 8577.2
government thing everywhere it's the

8573.24 --> 8579.84
mega corporations and the banks they're

8577.2 --> 8583.240000000002
controlling this government

8579.84 --> 8586.64
ship they're doing that the government

8583.24 --> 8589.359
ship falls away then that changes the

8586.64 --> 8593.72
game and it's like it could blow back

8589.359 --> 8597.0
big time really big and then it's like a

8593.72 --> 8601.16
chain reaction going

8597.0 --> 8603.96
upward and if that happens then

8601.16 --> 8608.08
Mega corporations and their big

8603.96 --> 8611.358999999999
platforms and everything could be

8608.08 --> 8615.16
freed theoretically it could be freed up

8611.359 --> 8618.24
like really liberated and a lot could be

8615.16 --> 8622.0
restored almost like reset to its old

8618.24 --> 8626.039999999999
scenario cuz you might think they can

8622.0 --> 8626.04
never do that oh yes they

8626.72 --> 8634.08
can it's actually quite a standard

8630.0 --> 8635.319
system even in like any desktop computer

8634.08 --> 8640.64
we can just

8635.319 --> 8645.16
say reset back to this

8640.64 --> 8647.358999999999
date and like click bang it's exactly

8645.16 --> 8650.399
how it was oh you need to like quickly

8647.359 --> 8653.56
update to to take care of like some

8650.399 --> 8655.96
security issues but they can just like

8653.56 --> 8659.24
all this algorithmic [ __ ] all this

8655.96 --> 8662.08
political they could just just like that

8659.24 --> 8666.279
overnight and it's like never happened

8662.08 --> 8667.64
it is possible I know absolutely certain

8666.279 --> 8670.92
that that is a

8667.64 --> 8672.72
possibility but they would have to

8670.92 --> 8675.399
then

8672.72 --> 8677.519999999999
first the people that have made things

8675.399 --> 8679.76
the way they are they would have to lose

8677.52 --> 8682.84
the control over it the mega

8679.76 --> 8685.12
corporations would have to give up their

8682.84 --> 8685.12
their

8685.24 --> 8690.84
control be forced to disband

8689.319 --> 8692.039999999999
basically

8690.84 --> 8693.960000000001
to break

8692.04 --> 8698.6
up

8693.96 --> 8701.199999999999
and have other new people take control

8698.6 --> 8702.76
back and then those people could do that

8701.2 --> 8705.84
like old

8702.76 --> 8708.960000000001
YouTube lovers that are like we want the

8705.84 --> 8710.399
old YouTube back could be given it and

8708.96 --> 8712.438999999998
they could say okay we're going to just

8710.399 --> 8718.119999999999
turn it in the way it used to

8712.439 --> 8721.6
be bang Freedom bang welcome

8718.12 --> 8724.279
back it could happen it can happen it

8721.6 --> 8727.279
can still happen

8724.279 --> 8727.279
but

8727.359 --> 8734.84
realistically the chances that it will

8729.52 --> 8734.84
happen is less than 50% in my

8740.6 --> 8747.399000000001
opinion but what will happen is that

8743.72 --> 8749.64
there be ever increasing

8747.399 --> 8750.72
terribleness of these government the

8749.64 --> 8752.16
corrupted government governments

8750.72 --> 8754.319
everywhere in the west

8752.16 --> 8756.2
especially and what the banks have been

8754.319 --> 8759.119999999999
doing in the mega

8756.2 --> 8761.84
corporations they've been becoming like

8759.12 --> 8765.640000000001
worse and worse for a reason they've

8761.84 --> 8768.8
becoming worse and worse to try to

8765.64 --> 8772.88
outpace their actual loss of

8768.8 --> 8775.358999999999
control the frenzy is basically them

8772.88 --> 8777.92
trying to claw their way out while

8775.359 --> 8779.24
they're sliding down that's why it's

8777.92 --> 8784.6
getting so

8779.24 --> 8786.16
bad and that it gets more and more

8784.6 --> 8789.279
bad

8786.16 --> 8793.56
quickly like at a surreal

8789.279 --> 8797.84
pace is logically an indication that

8793.56 --> 8800.08
they are not clawing their way out they

8797.84 --> 8802.479
are slipping out and they're becoming

8800.08 --> 8805.16
more desperate more aggressive more

8802.479 --> 8807.599999999999
psychologically

8805.16 --> 8810.279
assaulting and that is a good sign that

8807.6 --> 8812.68
is the sign that it is going to be over

8810.279 --> 8812.68
over

8814.319 --> 8823.56
soon the exponential increasing rate

8818.52 --> 8827.16
leads to a unavoidable zero

8823.56 --> 8827.16
point the ASM

8827.279 --> 8834.52
toote the absolute unavoidable zero is

8832.12 --> 8837.04
where it's going to go and it's we're

8834.52 --> 8839.16
getting there very quickly we're getting

8837.04 --> 8840.800000000001
there very Steep and that means there's

8839.16 --> 8843.56
not a lot of time left

8840.8 --> 8846.92
when that's until when that's reached

8843.56 --> 8848.56
we're almost there like really right

8846.92 --> 8852.92
around the

8848.56 --> 8854.72
corner I feel I feel it's like this year

8852.92 --> 8856.399
I felt it last year it's going to be

8854.72 --> 8859.24
this

8856.399 --> 8862.96
year and the way it's going the way how

8859.24 --> 8866.64
steep it's going like how braz they're

8862.96 --> 8869.438999999998
just they classifying criminal

8866.64 --> 8872.599999999999
actions like some things like Biden

8869.439 --> 8875.56
recently said just out in the open did

8872.6 --> 8875.56
you did you know

8876.2 --> 8885.2
that and it was a flub but what what

8881.0 --> 8890.8
kind of a crazy flub is that like he he

8885.2 --> 8890.800000000001
said on camera like we got like the the

8891.64 --> 8896.24
biggest voter

8893.8 --> 8900.438999999998
fraud system

8896.24 --> 8903.88
ever like he said that this live on

8900.439 --> 8911.08
camera like

8903.88 --> 8911.08
what what I mean I I didn't make that

8915.479 --> 8922.0
up but I mean when that sort of [ __ ]

8918.16 --> 8927.399
happens to that level you

8922.0 --> 8928.72
know things can't be lasting very long

8927.399 --> 8930.439
what did he say yeah you're just going

8928.72 --> 8932.84
to have to find it out yourself just

8930.439 --> 8932.84
look it

8939.88 --> 8944.64
up he he he basically confessed that

8943.0 --> 8948.52
they have

8944.64 --> 8951.24
like biggest voting fraud ever like he

8948.52 --> 8954.319000000001
he he probably tried to blame it on the

8951.24 --> 8956.56
opponent but that's not what he said so

8954.319 --> 8960.56
it it remains a flub but it's like the

8956.56 --> 8964.84
craziest flub ever when was this uh uh

8960.56 --> 8967.92
yesterday I think yesterday or the day

8964.84 --> 8970.64
before it's it's really nuts and it's

8967.92 --> 8972.960000000001
not like a video editing or it was like

8970.64 --> 8972.96
on

8974.6 --> 8981.359
camera crazy

8977.76 --> 8983.279
[ __ ] right anyway yeah that's I just

8981.359 --> 8985.880000000001
noticed that and I was like what the

8983.279 --> 8985.880000000001
[ __ ] is

8987.04 --> 8992.04
this that that was just surreal

8995.52 --> 9000.76
so not that it's any of my business or

8998.359 --> 9002.52
anything it's just that things that are

9000.76 --> 9006.24
happening that are getting out there are

9002.52 --> 9010.880000000001
just getting so crazy it's becoming too

9006.24 --> 9010.88
crazy to properly manage in your

9012.2 --> 9019.640000000001
head and the pace by which things are

9016.2 --> 9022.359
getting crazy is rapidly increasing

9019.64 --> 9024.76
which leads to the ASM toote moment the

9022.359 --> 9024.76
zero

9025.399 --> 9031.199999999999
point and thus I think that's very

9032.2 --> 9038.52
quick it is so quick I could say it

9036.279 --> 9043.76
might still be in

9038.52 --> 9046.52
March or it might be in April or

9043.76 --> 9051.319
May I think it's going to take place

9046.52 --> 9054.439
this spring big time and and places are

9051.319 --> 9056.359
probably going to blow up and burn down

9054.439 --> 9060.92
a lot of

9056.359 --> 9064.68
it and serious revolutions May suddenly

9060.92 --> 9068.359
unfold governments that that are just

9064.68 --> 9071.359
being absurdly criminal will be taken

9068.359 --> 9075.16
down with

9071.359 --> 9075.16
force all across the

9075.319 --> 9080.88
West there's a lot of stuff that's about

9078.2 --> 9082.640000000001
to happen about to explode

9080.88 --> 9085.8
in a big

9082.64 --> 9088.8
way and it would be like the biggest

9085.8 --> 9091.399
world Revolution that we've ever witness

9088.8 --> 9091.399
and we ever

9091.6 --> 9098.960000000001
will it will probably be

9095.68 --> 9100.56
considered World War II officially after

9098.96 --> 9104.119999999999
that

9100.56 --> 9104.119999999999
point after that's

9108.84 --> 9114.880000000001
done

9110.6 --> 9118.960000000001
cuz yeah anyway it's heavy

9114.88 --> 9122.64
[ __ ] it's pressing on me it's driving me

9118.96 --> 9124.438999999998
nuts a bit like I'm actually

9122.64 --> 9126.96
psychologically suffering under the

9124.439 --> 9126.960000000001
pressure I'm

9129.319 --> 9133.92
noticing right yeah I know L

9138.84 --> 9141.84
alot

9149.279 --> 9153.960000000001
but yeah something's going to happen and

9151.52 --> 9157.399000000001
it seems like it's going to happen

9153.96 --> 9160.88
soon it's winding me

9157.399 --> 9164.56
up I just feel like my spiritual antenna

9160.88 --> 9164.56
is just getting continually

9165.6 --> 9170.319
Zapped there's an energy in the air and

9168.359 --> 9172.56
it's building up it's getting more more

9170.319 --> 9174.8
and it's becoming like tough to handle

9172.56 --> 9174.8
for

9175.439 --> 9182.720000000001
me so I'm having a bit of a tough

9180.64 --> 9184.8
time resulting

9182.72 --> 9187.519999999999
in pretty

9184.8 --> 9191.96
dramatic mood

9187.52 --> 9191.960000000001
swings for my doing dramatic I

9193.72 --> 9200.278999999999
mean I'm in control of my

9198.04 --> 9203.439
expression but the exper

9200.279 --> 9203.439
is often quite

9216.439 --> 9225.279
unpleasant and my plan is to just take

9220.08 --> 9227.84
it easy as much as I can keep things

9225.279 --> 9230.960000000001
simple lay off the Cannabis because

9227.84 --> 9235.12
that's that ain't going to help me at

9230.96 --> 9237.438999999998
all not until the Energy starts dying

9235.12 --> 9237.439
down

9237.68 --> 9243.279
again and I don't know how long it will

9240.76 --> 9246.12
take before it does

9243.279 --> 9248.399000000001
that like even without the Cannabis I'm

9246.12 --> 9251.2
noticing that I'm under strain and I

9248.399 --> 9251.199999999999
didn't expect

9258.72 --> 9261.72
that

9267.6 --> 9271.76
right

9269.2 --> 9276.439
anyhow been going for two and a half

9271.76 --> 9276.439
hours hope you all enjoyed the show thus

9276.479 --> 9283.519999999999
far never thought of dividing the future

9280.359 --> 9283.52
what are you talking about

9285.52 --> 9291.560000000001
rard isn't that exactly what I'm doing

9288.24 --> 9294.64
right now

9291.56 --> 9298.64
am I not describing what is happening

9294.64 --> 9301.88
and what is going to happen didn't I

9298.64 --> 9301.88
just do that

9311.56 --> 9317.519999999999
Richard giving you an esoteric PR

9315.52 --> 9318.6
prediction this is what I'm noticing

9317.52 --> 9320.399000000001
this is what I'm feeling this is what

9318.6 --> 9324.359
I'm seeing this is the patterns that I

9320.399 --> 9329.199999999999
can derive from what I'm picking up

9324.359 --> 9331.24
on this is what I know for effect it

9329.2 --> 9335.68
will lead

9331.24 --> 9338.279
to now I'm not entirely certain where in

9335.68 --> 9342.12
the curve that will lead to the ASM

9338.279 --> 9343.08
toote we are but I know it's getting

9342.12 --> 9347.479000000001
really

9343.08 --> 9350.68
Steep and when it gets really steep time

9347.479 --> 9355.8
becomes shorter and shorter to that

9350.68 --> 9355.800000000001
point and we're already way past the

9360.16 --> 9364.6
45° and that means there's not a lot of

9362.72 --> 9369.119999999999
time

9364.6 --> 9372.2
left cuz before the 45° there's been a

9369.12 --> 9376.84
long and slow and gradual

9372.2 --> 9378.399000000001
buildup that lasted decades Yes you

9376.84 --> 9381.6
heard me right

9378.399 --> 9385.119999999999
decades what like any ASM toote the

9381.6 --> 9388.52
steepness will eventually like make it's

9385.12 --> 9392.84
like a continual half life of the time

9388.52 --> 9394.92
and the increase and we're in that flash

9392.84 --> 9397.399
we're arriving to that flash point the

9394.92 --> 9398.8
zero point and it's it's going to be

9397.399 --> 9402.64
here very

9398.8 --> 9405.72
soon very soon and my prediction is

9402.64 --> 9408.519999999999
before the summer even

9405.72 --> 9411.519999999999
starts I can feel

9408.52 --> 9411.52
it

9414.52 --> 9419.68
and it's going to like it's going to

9417.319 --> 9425.68
influence the entire

9419.68 --> 9425.68
world but mostly Europe and the United

9438.52 --> 9441.52
States

9448.68 --> 9454.0
right and L elcott am I saying there

9450.72 --> 9458.84
will be a revolution in the United

9454.0 --> 9458.84
States well a change in the guard at

9461.72 --> 9467.08
least what would you suggest you do to

9467.96 --> 9472.679999999998
prepare well

9470.0 --> 9476.08
some basic food stock up I mean the the

9472.68 --> 9480.84
classic what do you do you know the

9476.08 --> 9484.039999999999
classics make sure you got access to

9480.84 --> 9485.24
water a a backup power generator would

9484.04 --> 9488.76
be

9485.24 --> 9491.56
handy you got some food stock

9488.76 --> 9495.399
up

9491.56 --> 9498.96
and don't get carried away too

9495.399 --> 9503.96
much about what will happen and expect

9498.96 --> 9506.88
others to go completely insane to like

9503.96 --> 9509.039999999999
demonic zombie level I mean we're

9506.88 --> 9511.24
already like on the

9509.04 --> 9515.0
freaking we're already seeing like

9511.24 --> 9519.479
people eating each other

9515.0 --> 9519.479
okay it's already on video

9524.399 --> 9532.64
now expect more of that and worse and

9529.479 --> 9532.64
and closer to

9535.84 --> 9540.08
you especially in the United

9542.72 --> 9547.56
States and here in the Netherlands I'm

9545.56 --> 9550.399
expected that we are going to be

9547.56 --> 9553.08
absolutely taxed to death and like

9550.399 --> 9557.358999999999
everybody's going to be horrendously

9553.08 --> 9560.6
poor it's going to be like communist

9557.359 --> 9563.319
Russia whereas like can't even afford a

9560.6 --> 9565.68
loaf of bread without a wheelbarrow full

9563.319 --> 9568.24
of money that kind of scenario that's

9565.68 --> 9570.64
what I'm expecting here and I'm really

9568.24 --> 9572.039999999999
really not looking forward to it it's

9570.64 --> 9575.519999999999
going to be

9572.04 --> 9579.04
terrible it might not be that terrible

9575.52 --> 9583.04
though but it's going to be pretty damn

9579.04 --> 9583.04
terrible it already kind of

9584.76 --> 9591.279
is there's a lot of people here that are

9587.56 --> 9593.96
like really s uing and losing their

9591.279 --> 9596.52
business because of just the out of

9593.96 --> 9599.519999999999
control supposed War

9596.52 --> 9599.52
economy

9599.72 --> 9606.0
but since the flash point seems to be

9604.2 --> 9609.800000000001
arriving very

9606.0 --> 9612.96
quickly we might also pull out of it and

9609.8 --> 9617.8
restore some of it back relatively

9612.96 --> 9620.8
quickly and that's I pray to God for

9617.8 --> 9624.84
that that we don't don't

9620.8 --> 9627.358999999999
just end up with a completely totally

9624.84 --> 9631.6
destroyed country where it's literally

9627.359 --> 9631.6
nothing you can even do to build it back

9636.24 --> 9642.08
up that's concerning my

9639.52 --> 9643.800000000001
country and I'm not even talking about

9642.08 --> 9645.56
like what's going to happen with France

9643.8 --> 9648.24
and Germany because I think that they're

9645.56 --> 9650.439
going to get it even

9648.24 --> 9652.96
worse

9650.439 --> 9656.68
there's some like serious like they are

9652.96 --> 9660.358999999999
like directly now going after Russia

9656.68 --> 9662.64
like they're just like making

9660.359 --> 9666.2
War

9662.64 --> 9666.199999999999
without without the

9666.72 --> 9673.679999999998
proxy fortification would be in

9670.6 --> 9675.04
order maybe maybe it depends on where

9673.68 --> 9678.479000000001
you're at L

9675.04 --> 9680.68
Alcott the best fortification is that

9678.479 --> 9683.24
nobody BAS basically knows you're there

9680.68 --> 9683.24
that's the best

9683.6 --> 9690.24
fortification best fortification is that

9686.88 --> 9690.24
nobody thinks you have

9691.399 --> 9699.199999999999
anything right if you buy a build a fort

9695.04 --> 9703.279
then people will be like H I wonder what

9699.2 --> 9707.04
they got that they built that Fort you

9703.279 --> 9708.960000000001
know so you got to take that into

9707.04 --> 9711.080000000002
account right if you're going to build a

9708.96 --> 9714.399
fort you better have like

9711.08 --> 9717.72
a like a team to defend the

9714.399 --> 9719.96
fort otherwise you're just it's just

9717.72 --> 9723.76
like a giant arrow pointing like here's

9719.96 --> 9726.199999999999
the resources here's the resources right

9723.76 --> 9730.0
so keep that in mind as

9726.2 --> 9734.960000000001
well secrecy and anonymity is the

9730.0 --> 9734.96
best defense against pillaging

9738.16 --> 9741.16
hordes

9743.76 --> 9751.56
build a Shack in the woods

9746.439 --> 9755.279
then yes or even better build a Shack in

9751.56 --> 9755.278999999999
the ground in the

9768.12 --> 9774.439
woods right but I mean if you're going

9770.8 --> 9778.519999999999
to have to do that right now you might

9774.439 --> 9778.52
be quite a bit short on

9785.96 --> 9791.759999999998
time I think if you don't yeah

9789.08 --> 9795.68
considering you don't have a lot of time

9791.76 --> 9798.319
to do that much just some basic food

9795.68 --> 9800.24
storage and power storage those kinds of

9798.319 --> 9802.68
things are

9800.24 --> 9805.56
great and

9802.68 --> 9810.08
then just in your

9805.56 --> 9811.399
basement and just don't stand out with

9810.08 --> 9814.479
your

9811.399 --> 9817.278999999999
house and like don't use your

9814.479 --> 9819.319
electricity at night so that everybody

9817.279 --> 9822.16
can see oh that's the only house that

9819.319 --> 9825.88
has light yeah that'll damn well attract

9822.16 --> 9825.88
looters guarantee you

9828.04 --> 9831.04
that

9842.359 --> 9846.52
10 friends within 10 m yeah hey tiger

9844.64 --> 9849.599999999999
bear good see you yeah but that also

9846.52 --> 9853.279
definitely is a good piece of advice

9849.6 --> 9855.800000000001
know know who you can count on have them

9853.279 --> 9858.04
in the vicinity be

9855.8 --> 9860.16
connected

9858.04 --> 9862.479000000001
definitely

9860.16 --> 9867.72
and there's guys that have already been

9862.479 --> 9870.278999999999
like Preppers and doomday scenario

9867.72 --> 9873.24
strategists that have been doing it for

9870.279 --> 9876.84
decades they know so much more about it

9873.24 --> 9879.119999999999
than me and my little improvised quick

9876.84 --> 9882.68
thinking strategies right

9879.12 --> 9884.960000000001
because I'm not a prepper I'm just some

9882.68 --> 9887.92
weirdo

9884.96 --> 9889.839999999998
guy on social welfare in the Netherlands

9887.92 --> 9891.68
where it's like there's no crapping here

9889.84 --> 9894.24
there's just no

9891.68 --> 9898.279
chance

9894.24 --> 9902.08
so there's people out there that know a

9898.279 --> 9902.08
lot more about it than

9903.0 --> 9909.68
me I got a wheelbarrow

9906.84 --> 9912.6
no and the wheelbarrow is just a

9909.68 --> 9915.960000000001
metaphor because that's what happened

9912.6 --> 9917.960000000001
with communist Russia yeah and that's

9915.96 --> 9920.96
before electronic

9917.96 --> 9920.96
payments

9923.25 --> 9926.45
[Music]

9945.319 --> 9949.6
yeah right but if there's going to be

9947.439 --> 9952.6
like insane inflation like that and

9949.6 --> 9955.76
eventually it will just be labor Economy

9952.6 --> 9957.56
based people are not going to like care

9955.76 --> 9959.319
about money anymore because it just

9957.56 --> 9962.72
loses its value too quickly and it'll

9959.319 --> 9965.119999999999
just be like okay I need 10 hours of

9962.72 --> 9967.76
Labor you'll get this food for 10 hours

9965.12 --> 9968.560000000001
of Labor and that's how things will be

9967.76 --> 9975.92
done

9968.56 --> 9975.92
then you will pay out in work contract

9976.64 --> 9984.56
hours and that complet completely

9979.399 --> 9984.56
bypasses any Bank based

9987.399 --> 9995.479
inflation yeah so it's like

9990.52 --> 9999.68
oh day worth of days worth of food is

9995.479 --> 9999.679999999998
like 4 hours of

9999.96 --> 10005.438999999998
Labor something like that that's

10002.72 --> 10007.399
probably what if it like the financial

10005.439 --> 10010.16
situation just

10007.399 --> 10011.439
grows yeah totally out of control that's

10010.16 --> 10013.92
what will

10011.439 --> 10016.68
happen but to be fair I don't think it's

10013.92 --> 10021.399
G to come to that

10016.68 --> 10025.12
here it's already too

10021.399 --> 10028.56
quick the ASM toote is already arriving

10025.12 --> 10031.319000000001
very fast there's like no time for all

10028.56 --> 10034.16
that to gradually happen

10031.319 --> 10038.519999999999
because that level of inflation that to

10034.16 --> 10041.479
that built up for like a decade slow

10038.52 --> 10043.560000000001
building up things are going too fast

10041.479 --> 10046.399
for that to build up like

10043.56 --> 10048.519999999999
that it's much more likely that's just

10046.399 --> 10049.68
an overnite change and then suddenly

10048.52 --> 10052.04
things work

10049.68 --> 10056.279
differently other people have control

10052.04 --> 10056.279
other policies are in place just like

10060.08 --> 10065.64
that but whatever's going to happen I

10062.359 --> 10065.640000000001
think it's going to happen very

10067.84 --> 10070.84
quickly

10074.37 --> 10080.52
[Music]

10090.8 --> 10094.84
all right so anyway I hope you all

10092.359 --> 10100.720000000001
enjoyed the

10094.84 --> 10100.72
show don't forget to Rogan it up

10109.52 --> 10115.560000000001
appreciate if you did you can support me

10112.439 --> 10117.359
through the PayPal and patreon could

10115.56 --> 10120.399
always use more patreon

10117.359 --> 10123.08
supporters but also direct support

10120.399 --> 10125.88
through the PayPal has been very helpful

10123.08 --> 10127.8
thus for I still am capable of like

10125.88 --> 10130.72
getting food thanks to the support of

10127.8 --> 10130.72
some of you guys

10138.439 --> 10142.08
Mojo blue pill

10142.8 --> 10145.8
Evolution

10145.96 --> 10154.08
Sam thanks to you guys I have like food

10150.359 --> 10157.0
for like at least the next half a week

10154.08 --> 10159.439
but I could really use some more

10157.0 --> 10163.56
support to be fair I'm not like in a

10159.439 --> 10166.64
huge hurry about it but I like to be

10163.56 --> 10166.64
ahead of those kinds of

10166.76 --> 10170.2
things but

10171.8 --> 10177.08
uh yeah support me if you can and I'll

10175.16 --> 10181.56
just keep going and

10177.08 --> 10183.96
I'll keep you all informed about my uh

10181.56 --> 10186.6
my readings on the

10183.96 --> 10190.64
world and give you the highlights of

10186.6 --> 10190.640000000001
some of the craziness that has occurred

10197.8 --> 10205.16
and maybe alter my predictions cuz Hey

10201.76 --> 10207.0
can still things can still change around

10205.16 --> 10210.16
I feel now that the flash point is going

10207.0 --> 10213.72
to arrive very quickly but certain

10210.16 --> 10219.08
events might transpire that will change

10213.72 --> 10222.76
the curve of it slow it down or like

10219.08 --> 10225.96
make it like oh [ __ ] it's in 2

10222.76 --> 10225.960000000001
days you

10227.68 --> 10234.68
know I mean if suddenly we start to hear

10231.439 --> 10236.52
like oh Russia has been launcing

10234.68 --> 10239.04
launching Hypersonic

10236.52 --> 10242.16
missiles well yeah then you don't need

10239.04 --> 10244.239000000001
to hear anything from me anymore do

10242.16 --> 10247.64
you am I

10244.239 --> 10250.64
right you'll just see

10247.64 --> 10250.64
it

10254.399 --> 10261.599999999999
and if suddenly like more than one

10257.04 --> 10265.52
location at the same time starts to get

10261.6 --> 10268.0
lasered and starts burning up well

10265.52 --> 10271.16
you'll also be able to draw the

10268.0 --> 10273.2
conclusion like oh well I guess

10271.16 --> 10275.359
armageddon's here

10273.2 --> 10279.92
now especially if you're going to like

10275.359 --> 10284.279
see it from your own house which is

10279.92 --> 10286.8
terrifying I hope you'll be spared from

10284.279 --> 10289.279
that unfortunately some people in the

10286.8 --> 10289.278999999999
world will

10290.8 --> 10296.479
not right

10293.0 --> 10296.479
but after

10296.84 --> 10302.399
every

10298.88 --> 10302.399
Dale there is a

10302.72 --> 10309.599999999999
climb right

10306.479 --> 10312.438999999998
it's it's the symbol of of death in the

10309.6 --> 10314.52
tarot it's death and

10312.439 --> 10316.68
rebirth every death there is an

10314.52 --> 10319.239
inevitable

10316.68 --> 10321.64
rebirth should you not bother booking a

10319.239 --> 10321.64
summer

10324.03 --> 10330.52
[Music]

10326.56 --> 10335.239
vacation Oscar it depends on

10330.52 --> 10338.6
where where did you plan is to book

10335.239 --> 10341.319
it certain regions you might want to

10338.6 --> 10342.640000000001
weigh it out for a bit but I mean even

10341.319 --> 10346.08
if you book

10342.64 --> 10348.519999999999
it it's like oh I'm booking this hotel

10346.08 --> 10350.84
well if the hotel suddenly like

10348.52 --> 10355.720000000001
evaporated well you're not going to be

10350.84 --> 10357.319
expected to pay for it right

10355.72 --> 10362.56
so

10357.319 --> 10362.56
but i' pick my destinations

10367.439 --> 10371.319
carefully

10369.239 --> 10373.76
black pool is

10371.319 --> 10378.119999999999
fabulous okay well anywhere within

10373.76 --> 10381.12
England is is pretty much similar

10378.12 --> 10383.640000000001
risk just realize the closer you are to

10381.12 --> 10384.68
a military base of any sort the higher

10383.64 --> 10388.16
you're at

10384.68 --> 10388.16
risk in these

10390.68 --> 10394.2
times yeah Lou

10395.04 --> 10399.080000000002
alut

10397.439 --> 10401.68
that's

10399.08 --> 10401.68
that's pretty

10404.479 --> 10411.8
scary I hope you'll be gone quick

10408.6 --> 10417.76
enough oh 50 miles is still quite a am

10411.8 --> 10417.759999999998
of distance remember nuclear bombs don't

10418.04 --> 10424.640000000001
exist but fire bombs do and Hypersonic

10422.16 --> 10429.52
missiles that can definitely blow up a

10424.64 --> 10432.199999999999
very large area can they do exist

10429.52 --> 10434.439
so but you don't have to worry like oh

10432.2 --> 10436.279
well if they threw a hydrogen bomb on

10434.439 --> 10438.359
this then the whole thing would be gone

10436.279 --> 10441.720000000001
in one go I mean that's not going to

10438.359 --> 10441.720000000001
