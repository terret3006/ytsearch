big gray soup out there now

107.92 --> 111.84
it's not the most interesting looking of

111.439 --> 116.0
what

111.84 --> 120.399
come on stupid focus

116.0 --> 123.6
like why anyway yeah it's not

120.399 --> 124.56
very interesting looking this doesn't

123.6 --> 128.399
seem to be any

124.56 --> 131.44
wind or it's not extra cold

128.399 --> 134.879
it's just gray and no

131.44 --> 134.879
sunlight to be visible

135.2 --> 140.79999999999998
so all right

138.319 --> 143.83999999999997
have a great saturday morning or

140.8 --> 143.84
saturday afternoon

144.64 --> 152.79999999999998
all right so rob h

148.4 --> 157.84
first and chat m toward the wazzle

152.8 --> 157.84
good to see you

159.04 --> 164.79999999999998
i got coffee with me and

162.56 --> 167.44
green tea i haven't poured that one in

164.8 --> 171.84
yet because i

167.44 --> 174.4
i guess i needed my sleep again

171.84 --> 175.04
because i woke up pretty much 15 minutes

174.4 --> 179.04
to

175.04 --> 179.04
one quite literal

179.36 --> 186.31900000000002
maybe also why my voice is a little bit

182.959 --> 186.31900000000002
sounds very early

187.28 --> 191.12
because i barely got my coffee and

194.159 --> 198.0
right now yeah but i'm having late

197.28 --> 202.0
nights

198.0 --> 206.239
it's not the most

202.0 --> 209.04
the smartest thing to do but i do it

206.239 --> 213.84
hey nathan oakley good to see you yeah i

209.04 --> 213.84
heard your computer has been repaired

215.92 --> 222.64
you suddenly popped on yesterday

219.2 --> 224.23899999999998
uh in the sky in the skype chat i

222.64 --> 226.55999999999997
noticed

224.239 --> 228.72
we're very active so your computer has

226.56 --> 230.48
been effectively repaired and

228.72 --> 232.0
there was an issue with the sound card

230.48 --> 235.84
too and all that so yeah

232.0 --> 236.64
the usual preponderance of complications

235.84 --> 241.84
that comes

236.64 --> 241.83999999999997
with you typically nathan

242.159 --> 245.599
i think that your sound studio might

244.319 --> 248.07999999999998
have a detrimental

245.599 --> 250.07999999999998
influence on the integrity of your

248.08 --> 252.48000000000002
computer systems

250.08 --> 253.68
i think the computer does not like sound

252.48 --> 257.12
to be perfectly

253.68 --> 257.12
reflected the way it does

257.84 --> 261.03999999999996
you just didn't ask

261.6 --> 265.199
i don't know seriously computers are

264.0 --> 268.08
tricky things

265.199 --> 270.32
my computer is awesome got an

268.08 --> 274.0
understanding

270.32 --> 274.0
i'm starting to call her she

274.8 --> 278.24
even though it's not amiga

279.04 --> 283.84000000000003
and it never really breaks down

282.08 --> 287.68
when it breaks down it's usually the

283.84 --> 287.67999999999995
internet connection not the computer

287.78 --> 295.11999999999995
[Music]

291.84 --> 297.84
so yeah mine does break down extremely

295.12 --> 297.84000000000003
rarely

298.16 --> 301.6
although in your case you did kind of

300.32 --> 305.84
like

301.6 --> 308.08000000000004
hit the computer or something right

305.84 --> 309.52
by accident or on purpose or i don't

308.08 --> 313.59999999999997
know

309.52 --> 317.44
but yeah i would never hit my computer

313.6 --> 320.08000000000004
i used to come from a time where i had

317.44 --> 322.56
pcs too a little shitty maybe and i

320.08 --> 324.639
would hit them

322.56 --> 326.8
and sometimes yeah back in the day like

324.639 --> 329.52
with the commodore 64 you kind of

326.8 --> 331.039
had to hit them sometimes sounds totally

329.52 --> 334.479
ridiculous right

331.039 --> 337.68
not supervised but you had to because

334.479 --> 341.919
it was a computer nowadays

337.68 --> 344.16
that's not really how it works anymore

341.919 --> 352.479
i have noticed that the old hit the

344.16 --> 357.03900000000004
computer days are kind of over

352.479 --> 357.039
you as aussies call everything is she

364.84 --> 367.84
okay

371.36 --> 373.759
i guess

375.28 --> 382.55999999999995
i i don't in particular like

378.56 --> 386.0
for example my monitor screen is a he

382.56 --> 388.0
definitely i yeah though definitely oh

386.0 --> 389.68
that makes so much sense right yeah yeah

388.0 --> 390.88
figure that one out okay my monitor

389.68 --> 393.039
screen is definitely he

390.88 --> 394.24
it's just that my computer itself is a

393.039 --> 398.8
she

394.24 --> 400.72
i don't know why it just feels like that

398.8 --> 402.72
oh it makes no sense yeah well it makes

400.72 --> 409.84000000000003
no sense to me either it still feels

402.72 --> 409.84000000000003
like that though

428.319 --> 434.84000000000003
right anyway let's see

431.68 --> 436.8
i hope i made some notes probably not a

434.84 --> 441.67999999999995
lot

436.8 --> 451.68
no i didn't make any notes at all goody

441.68 --> 453.84000000000003
have to go by memory then

451.68 --> 455.199
all right there was no oven benjamin

453.84 --> 457.75899999999996
although he did stream again

455.199 --> 458.479
very late because just now when i

457.759 --> 461.68
started up

458.479 --> 463.68
i did get a pop-up so that usually means

461.68 --> 466.879
he streamed like somewhere between

463.68 --> 471.759
three and four at night or something

466.879 --> 471.759
there's no live stream in the day

473.68 --> 477.039
anybody catch that home benjamin late

476.479 --> 479.84
night

477.039 --> 479.84

487.84 --> 492.31
yeah make the note to make notes that's

490.8 --> 494.96000000000004
that's cute

492.31 --> 497.28000000000003
[Music]

494.96 --> 497.28

503.36 --> 507.759

530.0 --> 538.64
it's like like we have no direction

535.6 --> 541.6
without the housekeeping questions and

538.64 --> 543.36
you yelling at ballers tell them to suck

541.6 --> 548.72
your nuts

543.36 --> 550.5600000000001
we've lost all directions i feel like

548.72 --> 553.0400000000001
i'm drifting here

550.56 --> 555.3599999999999
without the flat earth debates it's so

553.04 --> 555.36
weird

558.72 --> 561.839
and it's not like oh okay that means

560.88 --> 564.959
let's

561.839 --> 565.44
now do that then then now i'm taking

564.959 --> 567.92
over

565.44 --> 577.839
no no it doesn't really work like that

567.92 --> 577.8389999999999
hold on

580.64 --> 584.08
i hate it when the mute button doesn't

582.32 --> 591.839
work when i wanted to

584.08 --> 591.839
be right back

686.839 --> 689.839
so

701.76 --> 707.92
yo yeah

704.88 --> 709.42
sorry to take a bathroom break for a

707.92 --> 712.54
second

709.42 --> 712.54
[Music]

714.839 --> 717.839
uh

728.839 --> 733.519
so

730.0 --> 733.519
all right uh anyway

735.44 --> 744.8800000000001
yeah watch the more babylon 5 and stuff

740.24 --> 747.2
uh i've really done a lot of other

744.88 --> 747.2
things

754.16 --> 759.04
right so yeah that there goes the notes

770.8 --> 774.7199999999999
what's the medallion it's a medallion

774.88 --> 781.12
it's silver i made it it's a flower of

778.8 --> 781.12
life

782.24 --> 788.32
been wearing it for over a year since

786.0 --> 790.399
i lost the previous hangar by the way

788.32 --> 792.8000000000001
which i had a dream about

790.399 --> 794.32
like two days ago i remember that was

792.8 --> 796.8
weird

794.32 --> 800.1600000000001
very weird dream back then i don't know

796.8 --> 802.8
why i didn't bring it up at all

800.16 --> 805.12
maybe because it was not a pleasant

802.8 --> 805.12
dream

805.44 --> 810.32
like it was a dream that was trying to

810.8 --> 815.3599999999999
basically in a surreal fashion

813.839 --> 818.8000000000001
emphasized to me that

815.36 --> 821.6
in my endeavors i would things would

818.8 --> 821.5999999999999
gradually

823.519 --> 828.72
like i would lose basic things

826.88 --> 830.8
like things would deteriorate things

828.72 --> 831.44
with damage not talking about my body

830.8 --> 835.76
but

831.44 --> 840.24
like i had this weird dream for example

835.76 --> 842.88
where i was basically climbing a cliff

840.24 --> 845.76
like a sandy type a cliff situation with

842.88 --> 848.24
other peoples and then at some point

845.76 --> 849.92
a big chunk of sand just broke off

848.24 --> 856.399
because somebody got clumsy

849.92 --> 860.3199999999999
and then like ev we all literally like

856.399 --> 862.8
yeah basically fell into the ocean

860.32 --> 864.639
and then i lost my shoes which makes

862.8 --> 866.0
absolutely no sense i was really

864.639 --> 868.839
disappointed

866.0 --> 870.32
like what how the [ __ ] do i lose my

868.839 --> 872.9590000000001
shoes

870.32 --> 873.36
in the water when i was climbing a cliff

872.959 --> 877.1199999999999
makes

873.36 --> 880.639
no damn sense but i did

877.12 --> 880.639
and it was really frustrating

881.76 --> 887.4399999999999
i've been having more of these dreams

883.68 --> 887.4399999999999
it's like i don't know what's going on

894.399 --> 899.839
usually in my dreams i find interesting

897.36 --> 899.839
things

900.079 --> 905.5999999999999
and don't lose things

903.279 --> 906.8
that doesn't really happen a lot but it

905.6 --> 910.48
has been recently

906.8 --> 912.0
and not happy about it maybe it's an

910.48 --> 914.5600000000001
expression of like i'm

912.0 --> 916.399
running into a ditch slowly and that's

914.56 --> 917.279
not a good dream to have that's not a

916.399 --> 922.16
good

917.279 --> 922.16
thing to detect in the flow of things

923.519 --> 928.399
i've been yeah i've been feeling now for

926.32 --> 929.279
some time again like i'm starting to run

928.399 --> 932.399
into a ditch

929.279 --> 935.04
it's weird i still

932.399 --> 937.279
talk about plenty of things still have

935.04 --> 940.16
good answers i still have good ideas

937.279 --> 941.759
new ideas but i still feel like i'm

940.16 --> 945.68
running into a ditch it's

941.759 --> 945.6800000000001
really odd i can't explain it

946.72 --> 953.0400000000001
ever since i had my sickness

950.32 --> 954.0
week after that it was so fiery coming

953.04 --> 958.16
out of it and now it

954.0 --> 958.16
seems like that fire has all died down

959.04 --> 963.519
like i don't even have the bigger

960.56 --> 965.8389999999999
impulses to yell at trolls anymore

963.519 --> 968.88
it's a really extreme contrast it

965.839 --> 971.839
unnerves me that the contrast is so big

968.88 --> 972.88
i'm like where is the fire i miss the

971.839 --> 976.1600000000001
fire

972.88 --> 978.88
i lit i got crazy ideas right now

976.16 --> 979.36
okay and i don't like it i got ideas

978.88 --> 981.279
like

979.36 --> 983.04
yeah i'm gonna drink again because i

981.279 --> 984.72
want to be sick again because i want

983.04 --> 988.0
that fire again

984.72 --> 990.639
that's not a good way to think i don't

988.0 --> 997.519
like that thinking

990.639 --> 1000.639
i wonder like what is this

997.519 --> 1004.5600000000001
why where am i this is very strange

1000.639 --> 1004.5600000000001
it's a strange place to be for me

1008.839 --> 1011.839
spiritually

1019.36 --> 1023.36
maybe i just

1021.72 --> 1026.64
[Music]

1023.36 --> 1029.919
need to meet a girl or something

1026.64 --> 1031.919
that would definitely like throw things

1029.919 --> 1034.88
upside down

1031.919 --> 1034.88
and i could use it

1035.919 --> 1041.6000000000001
use it

1039.679 --> 1042.88
i think it would probably do me some

1041.6 --> 1044.799
good

1042.88 --> 1047.3600000000001
because i am getting i just feel like

1044.799 --> 1050.08
i'm getting rusted

1047.36 --> 1052.1599999999999
rusted into place doing the same things

1050.08 --> 1054.1599999999999
over and over again

1052.16 --> 1056.4
it's not completely useless it's not

1054.16 --> 1059.039
like it's all a waste of time

1056.4 --> 1059.6000000000001
and like the whole swath of other people

1059.039 --> 1061.76
that

1059.6 --> 1062.8799999999999
do that their entire lives but they

1061.76 --> 1065.44
don't even know it

1062.88 --> 1066.48
i know it when somebody's wasting their

1065.44 --> 1068.799
time

1066.48 --> 1071.3600000000001
and i don't like it i don't want to be a

1068.799 --> 1071.36
part of that

1072.64 --> 1076.64
so maybe i just

1074.32 --> 1079.28
[Music]

1076.64 --> 1080.64
need to get into a relationship again

1079.28 --> 1083.12
usually that does it

1080.64 --> 1085.8400000000001
you know every time that happens there's

1083.12 --> 1088.32
always like bigger challenges like what

1085.84 --> 1089.76
freaking psychological position are you

1088.32 --> 1093.4399999999998
going to take

1089.76 --> 1096.08
within the relationship yeah because you

1093.44 --> 1098.16
can't just be yourself that's like a

1096.08 --> 1100.3999999999999
physical impossibility

1098.16 --> 1101.44
in a relationship chemistry does not

1100.4 --> 1106.3200000000002
work that way

1101.44 --> 1106.3200000000002
it's ridiculous to pretend like it would

1106.799 --> 1111.679
no not tindering you [ __ ] pervert

1112.08 --> 1116.3999999999999
that's disgusting did you have you ever

1114.88 --> 1118.96
used that

1116.4 --> 1120.16
then you're gay if you use tinder you're

1118.96 --> 1123.8400000000001
gay

1120.16 --> 1123.8400000000001
got that it's disgusting

1129.86 --> 1132.9199999999998
[Music]

1134.88 --> 1140.4
no i'm talking about actually somebody

1137.679 --> 1143.039
that might fall in love with me

1140.4 --> 1145.1200000000001
maybe mutual even though i plan never to

1143.039 --> 1149.52
ever fall in love ever again

1145.12 --> 1152.08
because it's uh it's horrific

1149.52 --> 1154.24
it just makes me do things that i always

1152.08 --> 1157.6789999999999
end up regretting

1154.24 --> 1160.32
because it makes me delusional

1157.679 --> 1161.6000000000001
makes me put people on pedestals that

1160.32 --> 1165.84
they don't deserve

1161.6 --> 1165.84
nobody deserves that

1168.16 --> 1171.8400000000001
but then again it's always a challenge

1170.559 --> 1175.12
and there's always

1171.84 --> 1178.3999999999999
huge heartbreaks and [ __ ] and i'm

1175.12 --> 1181.52
yeah that does certainly get me

1178.4 --> 1184.0
moving spiritually

1181.52 --> 1185.36
and who knows maybe i'll find the right

1184.0 --> 1189.28
one someday and have

1185.36 --> 1191.36
kids well they do long for that in ways

1189.28 --> 1193.6
it's going to absolutely change

1191.36 --> 1194.799
everything forever my entire chemistry

1193.6 --> 1197.1999999999998
i'll probably

1194.799 --> 1198.559
first start out having the feeling like

1197.2 --> 1201.2
i literally doom

1198.559 --> 1202.8799999999999
myself forever and i'll never ever be

1201.2 --> 1205.28
free again that sort of horrific

1202.88 --> 1208.64
sensation i'll feel it i'll get it

1205.28 --> 1211.28
and i'll accept it because

1208.64 --> 1213.3600000000001
effectively i'm already there i feel

1211.28 --> 1216.3999999999999
like i'm stuck forever

1213.36 --> 1218.8799999999999
right and that isn't going away until it

1216.4 --> 1218.88
changes

1219.28 --> 1224.32
so screw that screw freedom screw my

1222.48 --> 1227.3600000000001
life it's overestimated like

1224.32 --> 1227.36
[ __ ] all that

1227.44 --> 1235.8400000000001
like i don't care i don't care for this

1231.2 --> 1235.8400000000001
stupid freedom that means nothing

1245.36 --> 1249.84
freedom is overestimated it's all

[ __ ]

1250.87 --> 1256.6399999999999
[Music]

1253.52 --> 1258.4
if you're fighting if you're just

1256.64 --> 1263.8400000000001
trying to conquer your own freedom

1258.4 --> 1263.8400000000001
you're literally a slave to your ego

1281.36 --> 1283.6789999999999
wow

1285.6 --> 1290.1589999999999
well i hope to maybe be lucky enough to

1288.88 --> 1294.3200000000002
be able to experience

1290.159 --> 1296.72
that if literally god's god allows that

1294.32 --> 1298.72
because i have a fear like he will not

1296.72 --> 1300.08
give me that magic moment even if i did

1298.72 --> 1303.3600000000001
have a kid

1300.08 --> 1304.72
that would be horrific it's like one of

1303.36 --> 1308.08
the fears

1304.72 --> 1310.96
i have like that instinct will just not

1308.08 --> 1314.24
kick in because of the things that

1310.96 --> 1314.24
happened to me in the past

1314.4 --> 1319.8400000000001
i don't know i will never know until i

1316.84 --> 1319.84
try

1325.84 --> 1330.6399999999999
maybe yeah maybe i squandered the powers

1329.2 --> 1334.559
given to me in the past

1330.64 --> 1335.2
and thus such glorious gifts have just

1334.559 --> 1339.28
been

1335.2 --> 1341.3600000000001
taken from me and now as a whole

1339.28 --> 1343.44
hundreds of people potentially after now

1341.36 --> 1347.28
me saying this are like what

1343.44 --> 1350.3200000000002
why would you assume that why

1347.28 --> 1352.6399999999999
like do they even

1350.32 --> 1353.84
know somebody else that has experienced

1352.64 --> 1356.72
that

1353.84 --> 1356.72
probably not

1357.76 --> 1361.52
it's usually people that just outright

1360.72 --> 1366.0
reject

1361.52 --> 1367.9189999999999
logos that tend to then experience that

1366.0 --> 1370.0
people that choose they don't want it

1367.919 --> 1372.8400000000001
and then if they happen to

1370.0 --> 1374.159
run into that situation then they do

1372.84 --> 1377.28
indeed

1374.159 --> 1380.96
not experience the blessings

1377.28 --> 1384.0
well i was among that for some time

1380.96 --> 1386.559
it's a long time ago and i still

1384.0 --> 1390.0
remember from the visions

1386.559 --> 1392.6399999999999
that i faced god and that he with great

1390.0 --> 1393.84
punishing voice told me you will never

1392.64 --> 1397.2
have kids

1393.84 --> 1403.36
yeah just like that just like that bang

1397.2 --> 1407.2
in my face

1403.36 --> 1410.7199999999998
as a punishment by the way

1407.2 --> 1410.72
even though it's like i

1411.28 --> 1417.84
hadn't even seriously considered things

1414.72 --> 1420.72
so yeah and i'm fighting my entire

1417.84 --> 1423.36
[ __ ] life now to basically undo that

1420.72 --> 1426.48
to dispel it to basically say no it's

1423.36 --> 1428.4799999999998
[ __ ] arimon it was never true it was

1426.48 --> 1430.4
never a punishment maybe it was just a

1428.48 --> 1434.32
challenge i don't know

1430.4 --> 1436.3200000000002
i can't no i just know it seems

1434.32 --> 1440.32
extremely tough for me to

1436.32 --> 1443.039
freaking just get it over with

1440.32 --> 1444.1589999999999
get a wife get a baby and shut the [ __ ]

1443.039 --> 1447.52
up

1444.159 --> 1448.4
yeah i in my mind i've been trying this

1447.52 --> 1451.9189999999999
[ __ ]

1448.4 --> 1452.88
for over 10 years with my ex i thought

1451.919 --> 1454.88
it was there

1452.88 --> 1457.2
and then she basically said no i'd

1454.88 --> 1458.159
rather die than have children with

anyone

1458.159 --> 1474.72
goody [ __ ] goody

1472.32 --> 1475.6
because the ultimate solution is just

1474.72 --> 1478.24
walk up to

any random woman no matter how the [ __ ]

1478.24 --> 1481.679
they look or

1479.279 --> 1482.88
how smart they are and just get a baby

1481.679 --> 1486.0800000000002
just like that

1482.88 --> 1488.159
because that's not going to just trash

1486.08 --> 1490.96
everything and connect me to things that

1488.159 --> 1493.919
i don't want to be connected to

1490.96 --> 1495.3600000000001
because am i given a choice is the right

1493.919 --> 1497.3600000000001
woman coming after me

1495.36 --> 1499.12
or are they all running away like the

ones they would actually appreciate are

right well where's that actual growth

1627.919 --> 1632.88

another one three other ones

semi-crazy people into the world that

oh that is white pre-population jenna

1802.799 --> 1812.32
really that's why

what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

what because intelligent people are

earthers are depressing well maybe you

1825.12 --> 1830.2399999999998
should just

1825.76 --> 1833.919
get the [ __ ] out then piece of [ __ ]

1830.24 --> 1836.32
get the [ __ ] out and your stupid little

1846.88 --> 1851.2
[ __ ] off then go watch your stupid

squirt videos

1851.2 --> 1855.8400000000001
versus animal funny funny videos then if

1854.559 --> 1857.12
you don't want to watch anything

1855.84 --> 1859.519
depressing

1857.12 --> 1860.1589999999999
flat earthers globe are so depressing

there's no flat earth debate there's no

to get with

1890.48 --> 1894.32
to do that to be with the guys and not

1893.44 --> 1897.039
be

1894.32 --> 1898.8799999999999
in the main spotlight because it's very

different when i'm in a group and i'm

1898.88 --> 1904.96
not the main spotlight

1901.279 --> 1904.96
i have a div i don't have to be

1905.44 --> 1912.0
spending energy on trying to represent

1908.96 --> 1912.48
i can just spend all my energy on focus

1912.0 --> 1914.96
on

1912.48 --> 1917.1200000000001
digging on finding it in that moment in

1914.96 --> 1918.799
complete silence while the show is still

1917.12 --> 1921.9189999999999
going

1918.799 --> 1925.279
i can't do that here i have to be

1921.919 --> 1927.6000000000001
here represent somewhat entertain keep

1925.279 --> 1930.799
going i don't have the time to have

1927.6 --> 1934.8799999999999
find complete stillness and then find

1930.799 --> 1938.1589999999999
the interesting little gem to present

1934.88 --> 1939.3600000000001
at some point because this is my show i

1938.159 --> 1941.919
can't do that here

1939.36 --> 1942.7199999999998
i need other people and not to be in the

1941.919 --> 1945.039
front line

1942.72 --> 1949.84
seat not in the spotlight in order to

1945.039 --> 1949.84
achieve that

1955.0 --> 1962.08
33.33 amazing

1958.08 --> 1965.4399999999998
blah 33 is in my freaking email

1962.08 --> 1969.6789999999999
33 is in my telephone number

1965.44 --> 1971.6000000000001
33 is in everything

1969.679 --> 1974.0800000000002
so what the [ __ ] are you blabbering out

1971.6 --> 1977.1999999999998
of mason and

1974.08 --> 1981.36
it's the it's that the year

1977.2 --> 1984.24
the age cri christ died at right

1981.36 --> 1986.24
what the [ __ ] freemason freeman oh

1984.24 --> 1990.08
everything is freemason then

1986.24 --> 1993.279
everything right because 33

1990.08 --> 1994.0
is a number relatively low it's going to

1993.279 --> 1997.519
be in

1994.0 --> 2000.64
everything everything will be freemason

1997.519 --> 2001.1200000000001
because it has a 33 in it somewhere how

2000.64 --> 2004.0800000000002
many

2001.12 --> 2006.6399999999999
buildings and streets do you know that

2004.08 --> 2019.84
do not have a number 33 in them

2006.64 --> 2019.8400000000001
okay okay yeah

2022.19 --> 2025.239
[Music]

2036.88 --> 2047.8400000000001
voynich what are you doing

2055.119 --> 2059.44
all right well i've never had that many

2057.599 --> 2063.839
people watching nathan

2059.44 --> 2066.8
like i have not been designated for a

2063.839 --> 2067.44
bigger stream like that youtube could do

2066.8 --> 2070.079
that

2067.44 --> 2070.56
could just say oh right we have another

2070.079 --> 2074.32
plan

2070.56 --> 2076.32
designation for this channel now

2074.32 --> 2077.679
right because youtube does that just

2076.32 --> 2081.2000000000003
decide oh oh

2077.679 --> 2084.48
we think he is going to be more

2081.2 --> 2088.0
important on the scale of things that we

2084.48 --> 2090.96
decide people think is important

2088.0 --> 2092.32
right youtube because you decide

2090.96 --> 2095.359
everything

2092.32 --> 2098.48
you decide what's popular right

2095.359 --> 2100.0789999999997
you do not we not the people that

2098.48 --> 2102.32
actually care about things

2100.079 --> 2103.8390000000004
we don't have a say in what is popular

2102.32 --> 2106.48
no you

2103.839 --> 2108.0
determine what is popular don't you

2106.48 --> 2111.04
youtube

2108.0 --> 2111.839
you do just scaling up the numbers say

2111.04 --> 2114.88
oh yeah

2111.839 --> 2117.2
that guy that guy is the most popular

2114.88 --> 2118.96
because he has all accounts he has all

2117.2 --> 2122.56
the views all the ads

2118.96 --> 2125.68
everything because we decide he has

2122.56 --> 2126.24
that right youtube that's how you

2125.68 --> 2129.2799999999997
operate

2126.24 --> 2132.56
right it's a complete sham

2129.28 --> 2137.3590000000004
it's all a giant corporate communist

2132.56 --> 2140.32
system with a flare with an illusion

2137.359 --> 2141.5989999999997
that it's all equal everybody equal

2140.32 --> 2145.52
opportunity it's

2141.599 --> 2147.04
total fake capitalism under just direct

2145.52 --> 2149.44
tyranny

2147.04 --> 2151.2
communist corporatism that's what you

2149.44 --> 2155.2000000000003
are aren't you youtube

2151.2 --> 2158.7999999999997
everything about you is a complete lie

2155.2 --> 2160.8799999999997
everything all the stats all the numbers

2158.8 --> 2164.5600000000004
the viewers how that even connect

2160.88 --> 2164.88
it's all a giant scam everything about

2164.56 --> 2168.88
you

2164.88 --> 2172.48
is a scam is no free flow

2168.88 --> 2175.359
there is no free connecting

2172.48 --> 2175.359
it isn't there

2176.96 --> 2181.52
because generally people come and go if

2180.0 --> 2184.32
there is no momentum

2181.52 --> 2185.68
given to a channel by youtube itself no

2184.32 --> 2189.3590000000004
green light given

2185.68 --> 2191.52
then they do not grow they don't they

2189.359 --> 2193.04
get a couple of people that trickle in

2191.52 --> 2194.079
and then another couple of people

2193.04 --> 2195.68
trickle out

2194.079 --> 2198.1600000000003
and that's what you do that's what you

2195.68 --> 2201.5989999999997
decide you decide

2198.16 --> 2204.8799999999997
where channels are at you decide that

2201.599 --> 2207.52
for us and then somebody can put in

2204.88 --> 2209.04
more effort they can advertise the [ __ ]

2207.52 --> 2211.599
out of it they can just

2209.04 --> 2212.16
improve the quality and then you may

2211.599 --> 2215.3590000000004
think

2212.16 --> 2217.44
wow okay in the format

2215.359 --> 2219.04
is a little bit more professional okay

2217.44 --> 2222.64
we'll give him 20

2219.04 --> 2225.119
more we'll allow 20 more traffic

2222.64 --> 2225.92
because he put in so much effort kind of

2225.119 --> 2227.52
like what

2225.92 --> 2229.04
what's happened with nathan a little

2227.52 --> 2230.56
even though he's been downgraded even

2229.04 --> 2235.44
despite all that

2230.56 --> 2237.839
right but with me who gives a [ __ ]

2235.44 --> 2240.0
you know it's not like i have a daily

2237.839 --> 2241.7599999999998
show where i now perform for two hours

2240.0 --> 2243.44
talk about absolutely everything

2241.76 --> 2247.2000000000003
extremely controversial

2243.44 --> 2248.48
a gifts no [ __ ] literally gives no [ __ ]

2247.2 --> 2250.72
about the rules

2248.48 --> 2251.68
what i can't talk about kofi well [ __ ]

2250.72 --> 2254.24
you

2251.68 --> 2254.96
[ __ ] you youtube i'll [ __ ] talk about

2254.24 --> 2257.4399999999996
covet

2254.96 --> 2258.2400000000002
and how it's absolutely fabricated from

2257.44 --> 2261.599
the start

2258.24 --> 2265.1189999999997
and that viruses don't [ __ ] exist

2261.599 --> 2266.0
[ __ ] yeah i'll do that but nobody gives

2265.119 --> 2268.48
a [ __ ]

2266.0 --> 2270.32
because my numbers don't go up right

2268.48 --> 2274.96
it's all it's all just

2270.32 --> 2278.7200000000003
so just titan youtube doesn't allow it

2274.96 --> 2281.839
right doesn't even allow me to get some

2278.72 --> 2284.48
kind of controversy on anything

2281.839 --> 2285.7599999999998
because that would help then i'd get

2284.48 --> 2288.48
dynamite seem more

2285.76 --> 2290.48
interesting from the side right it

2288.48 --> 2292.4
doesn't give a [ __ ] my numbers my

2290.48 --> 2295.92
numbers are just the same

2292.4 --> 2299.76
they've g they've in a year

2295.92 --> 2302.96
gave me five percent extra

2299.76 --> 2303.3590000000004
oh i got five percent more so that at

2302.96 --> 2306.32
least

2303.359 --> 2307.119
i now have emphasized now i can no

2306.32 --> 2309.6800000000003
longer say

2307.119 --> 2310.96
it's been cut it's been cut for over a

2309.68 --> 2312.8799999999997
year on the exact

2310.96 --> 2314.079
same number of subscribers now i got a

2312.88 --> 2317.2000000000003
few extra

2314.079 --> 2318.48
so now yeah now at least shut up a

2317.2 --> 2320.48
little bit more

2318.48 --> 2322.16
about it right because they don't want

2320.48 --> 2324.079
to give me the bandwidth

2322.16 --> 2326.0
they don't want people to connect to

2324.079 --> 2328.88
this they hate me they

2326.0 --> 2329.92
hate me utterly because i'm in direct

2328.88 --> 2333.04
opposition of

2329.92 --> 2335.599
everything they stand for every [ __ ]

2333.04 --> 2337.2
little mind control [ __ ] corporate

2335.599 --> 2340.1600000000003
piece of [ __ ]

2337.2 --> 2341.359
up there i'm in direct opposition of all

2340.16 --> 2343.68
of them and i hope

2341.359 --> 2345.52
that at some point they will freaking

2343.68 --> 2348.0
jump out of their buildings

2345.52 --> 2351.599
because their scumbag corporate is

2348.0 --> 2351.599
coming as pieces of [ __ ]

2353.04 --> 2356.88
yeah and they don't give me the

2355.76 --> 2359.3590000000004
bandwidth

2356.88 --> 2362.6400000000003
they just don't give me because i'm just

2359.359 --> 2365.92
a random shitty channel on youtube

2362.64 --> 2369.5989999999997
right i'm not [ __ ] enough

2365.92 --> 2372.96
too dangerous my words hit

2369.599 --> 2375.92
too many real snares i can't be

2372.96 --> 2376.96
given the reach it's too dangerous it

2375.92 --> 2380.56
won't allow it

2376.96 --> 2384.079
you might find me and then the entire

2380.56 --> 2387.359
algorithm [ __ ] will ensure

2384.079 --> 2389.8390000000004
will ensure that whatever

2387.359 --> 2391.119
random person bumps into me that they'll

2389.839 --> 2393.04
forget about it

2391.119 --> 2394.88
that i'll forget about me again they'll

2393.04 --> 2396.96
be like oh that was interesting

2394.88 --> 2398.6400000000003
they'll move on because everybody's

2396.96 --> 2400.96
conditioned to do that on a regular

2398.64 --> 2403.359
basis and they'll just forget about me

2400.96 --> 2404.56
so that people don't actually connect on

2403.359 --> 2406.16
the long run

2404.56 --> 2408.88
everybody might have heard oh there's a

2406.16 --> 2411.359
random guy sometimes get angry

2408.88 --> 2412.319
sometimes get weird and interdimensional

2411.359 --> 2415.68
but nobody

2412.319 --> 2419.2799999999997
really cares because the computer

2415.68 --> 2422.0789999999997
ensures that nobody really cares

2419.28 --> 2422.6400000000003
by [ __ ] manipulating the [ __ ] out of

2422.079 --> 2426.48
every

2422.64 --> 2429.1189999999997
[ __ ] thing you can imagine without

2426.48 --> 2430.2400000000002
even noticing it because it's so subtle

2429.119 --> 2433.76
and [ __ ]

2430.24 --> 2436.7999999999997
yeah oh by the way thank you twad wassel

2433.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
for becoming a member

2436.8 --> 2439.8390000000004
very nice

2445.119 --> 2449.44
yeah yeah and they take my money they

2447.599 --> 2452.48
love taking my money

2449.44 --> 2454.48
yeah because i i put ads i put a lot of

2452.48 --> 2456.56
ads here on youtube

2454.48 --> 2458.56
and they love taking it they love it

2456.56 --> 2462.24
they're like yes

2458.56 --> 2465.52
continue on money breeding slave

2462.24 --> 2467.9199999999996
make us more money oh you think that

2465.52 --> 2468.88
we want you to get a lot more an actual

2467.92 --> 2471.52
wider audience

2468.88 --> 2472.56
no no we just want to give you enough

2471.52 --> 2474.88
money

2472.56 --> 2476.319
so that the government will take notice

2474.88 --> 2478.48
and take it from you

2476.319 --> 2480.64
so that you will be left with nothing

2478.48 --> 2482.48
but also enough to nag

2480.64 --> 2485.68
the people that follow you that might

2482.48 --> 2489.04
actually be slightly discouraged

2485.68 --> 2491.359
and that you'll feel cheap and abused

2489.04 --> 2493.2799999999997
yeah that's why they do it that's why

2491.359 --> 2497.04
they [ __ ] do it

2493.28 --> 2501.6800000000003
because they're all scumbags

2497.04 --> 2504.64
they're scum bags the people at youtube

2501.68 --> 2506.72
that do this that allow all of this [ __ ]

2504.64 --> 2510.4
to transpire the way it does that allow

2506.72 --> 2522.319
the algorithm to [ __ ] around like that

2510.4 --> 2525.04
they're all scum bags the worst

2522.319 --> 2526.56
i've been yeah i've been considering for

2525.04 --> 2529.04
a long time to

2526.56 --> 2529.599
to basically demonetize my channel and i

2529.04 --> 2532.56
couldn't

2529.599 --> 2533.76
i could not demonetize it because once

2532.56 --> 2536.16
it's turned on

2533.76 --> 2537.599
it can be turned off again unless i

2536.16 --> 2539.839
delete the channel

2537.599 --> 2541.2000000000003
so maybe at some point i will literally

2539.839 --> 2544.88
delete the channel and say

2541.2 --> 2548.0
okay [ __ ] everything [ __ ] youtube

2544.88 --> 2550.96
[ __ ] all of you also

2548.0 --> 2552.24
not people that are actually loyal

2550.96 --> 2557.68
followers but

2552.24 --> 2561.1189999999997
in a way yeah kind of all of you

2557.68 --> 2563.359
because it's all not helping nobody

2561.119 --> 2565.6800000000003
where's people learning where's people

2563.359 --> 2568.96
learning from the things i've taught

2565.68 --> 2572.56
where's people actually doing more like

2568.96 --> 2576.079
oh that was amusing and intelligent

2572.56 --> 2578.72
sounding i think he's more intelligent

2576.079 --> 2580.8
sounding than some of the other shows oh

2578.72 --> 2583.04
so what did you [ __ ] learn of that

2580.8 --> 2583.92
did you learn anything or did you just

2583.04 --> 2586.64
think it was

2583.92 --> 2588.0
intelligent sounding what a great

2586.64 --> 2590.64
amusement

2588.0 --> 2592.4
i can listen to this two hours a day

2590.64 --> 2595.04
feel slightly smarter

2592.4 --> 2595.52
and not having learned [ __ ] because you

2595.04 --> 2598.079
don't

2595.52 --> 2600.0
actually pay attention you don't

2598.079 --> 2602.48
actually try to learn

2600.0 --> 2603.599
about what i'm saying it just sounds

2602.48 --> 2606.64
really smart

2603.599 --> 2608.1600000000003
let's listen to this smart sounding

2606.64 --> 2620.1099999999997
person every day

2608.16 --> 2623.189
and not learn [ __ ]

2620.11 --> 2623.1890000000003
[Music]

2626.079 --> 2630.079
you should get the [ __ ] out of here

2632.839 --> 2635.839
[ __ ]

2638.53 --> 2641.6690000000003
[Music]

2658.88 --> 2667.839
so yeah is is that just it is it just

2662.8 --> 2671.44
this is all i'm gonna get this is it

2667.839 --> 2672.96
just no arwyn does not deserve it he

2671.44 --> 2677.839
just does not deserve

2672.96 --> 2677.839
more that's it

2685.52 --> 2689.119
because who gives a [ __ ] who gives a

2687.76 --> 2690.88
[ __ ] what i talk about

2689.119 --> 2693.28
i talk about everything and nobody

2690.88 --> 2695.359
really gives a [ __ ] it seems it's really

2693.28 --> 2696.7200000000003
nice when i bring up a conversation make

2695.359 --> 2699.5989999999997
a couple of good points

2696.72 --> 2700.7999999999997
and then just all slips away again into

2699.599 --> 2703.599
nothing

2700.8 --> 2705.2000000000003
to nothing maybe one time you'll watch

2703.599 --> 2708.2400000000002
it back

2705.2 --> 2710.64
but how much is it there nothing it's

2708.24 --> 2710.64
nothing

2712.24 --> 2716.8799999999997
fill my shoe with more gravy so what

2714.88 --> 2720.319
what do i do for that

2716.88 --> 2723.44
what do i need to drag a piano in here

2720.319 --> 2723.839
start being more amusing start being

2723.44 --> 2727.04
more

2723.839 --> 2727.359
average more entertainer because that is

2727.04 --> 2729.2799999999997
so

2727.359 --> 2731.5989999999997
important that brings in the money

2729.28 --> 2733.8390000000004
people just want to be entertained

2731.599 --> 2736.079
they don't want to learn [ __ ] they don't

2733.839 --> 2737.839
want to understand how things work

2736.079 --> 2739.2000000000003
because understanding makes you

2737.839 --> 2742.7999999999997
miserable

2739.2 --> 2746.0
yeah ignorance is bliss understanding

2742.8 --> 2748.5600000000004
is hell you don't want that you

2746.0 --> 2749.76
just want me to shut the [ __ ] up and be

2748.56 --> 2752.319
more amusing

2749.76 --> 2754.0
why don't i talk about my bow do i do

2752.319 --> 2756.48
not talk about my pendants

2754.0 --> 2758.72
oh why don't you do this arwen why don't

2756.48 --> 2762.48
you start learning how to juggle like a

2758.72 --> 2765.52
[ __ ] clown because that's amusing

2762.48 --> 2766.0
we don't want to learn anything here why

2765.52 --> 2769.7599999999998
would we

2766.0 --> 2772.88
learn why would we ask any question

2769.76 --> 2773.6800000000003
any question that's really intense and

2772.88 --> 2775.6800000000003
heavy

2773.68 --> 2777.2799999999997
and you never thought to ask anyone

2775.68 --> 2778.3999999999996
because you didn't think anybody could

2777.28 --> 2780.96
answer it right

2778.4 --> 2781.76
why would you take the effort to ask a

2780.96 --> 2784.56
really

2781.76 --> 2785.2000000000003
intense difficult question to me when

2784.56 --> 2788.48
i've said

2785.2 --> 2793.1189999999997
i can answer any

2788.48 --> 2796.2400000000002
question any question you could conceive

2793.119 --> 2799.599
i can answer nobody does it no

2796.24 --> 2803.68
what's is that a bow is that a bro arwen

2799.599 --> 2815.96
is that a pendant huh yeah

2803.68 --> 2819.04
that's the brilliance i'm facing here

2815.96 --> 2822.319
[Music]

2819.04 --> 2823.7599999999998
have it written or typed what what do i

2822.319 --> 2826.4
do

2823.76 --> 2830.5600000000004
written or typed gravy what the [ __ ] are

2826.4 --> 2833.76
you blabbering about jim west

2830.56 --> 2835.599
do you have a point here

2833.76 --> 2845.8390000000004
a point that actually makes sense in

2835.599 --> 2845.839
some sort of way

2859.28 --> 2862.559
hutchinson's effect the [ __ ] hell

2861.839 --> 2865.359
okay

2862.559 --> 2868.4
fine i'll look it up i'll google it to

2865.359 --> 2868.4
see what it is

2868.63 --> 2872.12
[Music]

2870.88 --> 2879.359
god damn it

2872.12 --> 2882.64
[Music]

2879.359 --> 2887.44
hutchinson effect oh right sound

2882.64 --> 2901.839
vibration causing weird [ __ ]

2887.44 --> 2901.839
yeah i've addressed that already

2913.599 --> 2918.8
seriously what what do i do with this

2916.96 --> 2920.16
it's just freaking weird what i'm

2918.8 --> 2924.079
supposed to figure out

2920.16 --> 2926.48
why really oh let's just

2924.079 --> 2928.559
put the hutchison effect on and stare at

2926.48 --> 2931.04
it all day and maybe i'll think of a

2928.559 --> 2934.559
model of what the [ __ ] going on

2931.04 --> 2937.68
sure is it gonna reveal anything

2934.559 --> 2940.88
about the actual mechanics no

2937.68 --> 2944.24
no it isn't at all

2940.88 --> 2946.319
it's just weird that's it

2944.24 --> 2948.0
right just like star in a jar is

2946.319 --> 2952.4
starring the jar going to

2948.0 --> 2955.52
reveal a bigger mechanism of reality

2952.4 --> 2956.0
no no it won't it's just gonna make a

2955.52 --> 2958.16
whole bunch

2956.0 --> 2959.76
of people squirt and say oh look because

2958.16 --> 2961.839
we have a star in a jar

2959.76 --> 2963.44
that means that we can just start

2961.839 --> 2966.24
assuming that it's just

2963.44 --> 2966.48
like that up there in the firmament and

2966.24 --> 2969.5989999999997
a

2966.48 --> 2974.319
water and blah blah blah blah blah

2969.599 --> 2974.319
what people do yeah i know

2974.36 --> 2981.359
[Music]

2977.44 --> 2981.68

2981.359 --> 2984.319
to

2981.68 --> 2986.3999999999996
explain every [ __ ] detail of any

2984.319 --> 2990.96
phenomena that's out there

2986.4 --> 2993.839
right that's it you just want me to

2990.96 --> 2995.359
unroll the entire akashic library for

2993.839 --> 2999.04
you just like that

2995.359 --> 3002.319
you think i can you think i'm allowed to

2999.04 --> 3006.079
no no actual questions not just

3002.319 --> 3008.4
i don't understand this

3006.079 --> 3009.8390000000004
can you explain what is going on with

3008.4 --> 3014.1600000000003
this phenomenon no

3009.839 --> 3017.2
no that's not the type of questions

3014.16 --> 3020.48
right i'm not ask

3017.2 --> 3025.9199999999996
that's not like come on

3020.48 --> 3027.68
the [ __ ] how am i supposed to know that

3025.92 --> 3028.88
why would you assume that i would

3027.68 --> 3031.7599999999998
understand that

3028.88 --> 3034.599
nobody freaking understands it okay and

3031.76 --> 3038.4
it's been around for decades

3034.599 --> 3042.2400000000002

3042.24 --> 3047.5989999999997
physicists in the world don't understand

3045.76 --> 3054.84

3094.88 --> 3099.44
oracle okay

3096.559 --> 3100.559
it's [ __ ] it sucks to be an oracle it's

3099.44 --> 3103.44
probably the worst

[ __ ] decision i ever made in the

3206.839 --> 3212.5589999999997
back

3209.04 --> 3215.68

3212.559 --> 3218.96
i don't know buy new shoes

3215.68 --> 3222.5589999999997
how about getting a new pair of pants

3218.96 --> 3225.68
that's like doesn't have over

3222.559 --> 3228.1600000000003
10 holes in them right

3225.68 --> 3230.24
that would be great pants that actually

3228.16 --> 3231.5989999999997
when you look up close still look like

3230.24 --> 3234.24
pants

3231.599 --> 3236.0
that would be great and not just some

3234.24 --> 3237.9199999999996
random piece of [ __ ] pants

3236.0 --> 3241.76
that doesn't properly fit and makes me

3237.92 --> 3241.76
feel and look like a [ __ ]

3242.319 --> 3251.839
how about that

3258.72 --> 3264.64
oh wow anton

3261.839 --> 3265.2799999999997
you think it's a limited idea you think

3264.64 --> 3269.2
that

3265.28 --> 3279.76
god is a limited idea really

3269.2 --> 3282.16
wow that's special

3279.76 --> 3283.6800000000003
no i'm afraid it's actually you that is

3282.16 --> 3287.2799999999997
limited

3283.68 --> 3288.8799999999997
and by that limitation yeah your ability

3287.28 --> 3292.0
to actually size up

3288.88 --> 3294.96
is therefore also limited i'm afraid

3292.0 --> 3295.44
that god is all-encompassing and he is

3294.96 --> 3298.48
the

3295.44 --> 3301.44
initiator the designer

3298.48 --> 3302.0
and the maintainer of creation which

3301.44 --> 3304.559
means

3302.0 --> 3305.52
everything everything that exists

3304.559 --> 3308.079
material

3305.52 --> 3308.96
spiritual the whole works all the

3308.079 --> 3312.7200000000003
dimensions

3308.96 --> 3316.799
all of it it's all god all of it

3312.72 --> 3320.0789999999997
every entity every conception every idea

3316.799 --> 3320.96
ever made ever conceived throughout

3320.079 --> 3324.48
history

3320.96 --> 3328.079
by spirits by human beings by the dead

3324.48 --> 3332.079
by children all of it is all god

3328.079 --> 3349.8390000000004
all of it so

3332.079 --> 3349.8390000000004
yeah safe to say i disagree

3351.119 --> 3356.48
another piece of the puzzle yeah yeah it

3353.76 --> 3360.6400000000003
is that's right

3356.48 --> 3364.2400000000002
a codex no no no it's the codex

3360.64 --> 3367.92
the codex because this codex contains

3364.24 --> 3371.5989999999997
the purest form of of the design

3367.92 --> 3371.599
it contains the path

3373.44 --> 3377.28
yeah i don't know any other book out

3375.92 --> 3379.359
there that does that

3377.28 --> 3380.48
that's why the bible is being

3379.359 --> 3383.92
systematically

3380.48 --> 3385.839
attacked and defamed and the other books

3383.92 --> 3388.839
aren't you might have taken notice

3385.839 --> 3390.0
you might have taken notice like the

3388.839 --> 3393.2
bible

3390.0 --> 3396.88
literally being assaulted mentally

3393.2 --> 3399.04
verbally by a whole group of people

3396.88 --> 3400.559
any other book out there you know that's

3399.04 --> 3403.44
suffering the same

3400.559 --> 3405.52
maybe the quran a little right from

3403.44 --> 3406.7200000000003
supposed christians that don't

3405.52 --> 3408.48
understand what the

3406.72 --> 3410.3999999999996
[ __ ] they're doing because they're all

3408.48 --> 3413.28
mind-controlled retards

3410.4 --> 3414.48
by a bunch of evil priests that tell

3413.28 --> 3416.88
them what it is

3414.48 --> 3417.52
and tell them how to believe even though

3416.88 --> 3420.6400000000003
christ

3417.52 --> 3423.68
specifically lessen number one

3420.64 --> 3427.04
told them don't listen to other people

3423.68 --> 3428.16
find god in you through you not somebody

3427.04 --> 3431.2799999999997
else

3428.16 --> 3432.0789999999997
first lesson failed whole society full

3431.28 --> 3434.2400000000002
of supposed

3432.079 --> 3436.079
christians that don't know what the [ __ ]

3434.24 --> 3438.24
they're doing

3436.079 --> 3440.6400000000003
just oh it's different it's different so

3438.24 --> 3443.68
it's evil because it's not exactly

3440.64 --> 3447.2
in this specific code written down

3443.68 --> 3449.44
as this special little special boy book

3447.2 --> 3449.4399999999996
right

3451.44 --> 3454.559
because they don't understand because

3453.04 --> 3457.599
they got caught into

3454.559 --> 3458.4
exoterics because the priest told them

3457.599 --> 3462.0
that that's the

3458.4 --> 3465.2000000000003
[ __ ] purpose yeah they were deceived

3462.0 --> 3467.68
big time because

3465.2 --> 3468.24
people get deceived because people are

3467.68 --> 3470.48
[ __ ]

3468.24 --> 3471.4399999999996
stupid and every time they're confronted

3470.48 --> 3475.359
with the truth

3471.44 --> 3477.52
it hurts they don't want it to hurt

3475.359 --> 3479.92
i don't want the responsibility of

3477.52 --> 3482.88

he's the very energy that allows things

to be alive

if god would ever decide to step out of

no it's about ontological primitives

3654.96 --> 3659.52
it's about the

inevitable structure of reality

which points there can only have been a

can only have ever been created and

unfold

3748.16 --> 3751.839
guided by god because god created

it's literally just cutting off your own

right but he allows that he allows

people to dwell there

3780.16 --> 3784.799
in the design it's allowed for you to be

dumb enough to think that you can be

without god

no i'm

4004.839 --> 4010.72
saying god is not satan satan

4008.079 --> 4013.44
is not god i'm just saying it's all part

of the same thing

it's not there is only satan no there is

only god

4017.28 --> 4025.119
and satan is simply another pawn

4021.28 --> 4028.799
be why because it must

4025.119 --> 4033.28
be because of the very [ __ ] nature of

reality and energy and the balance

4033.28 --> 4037.44
it can only be like that that doesn't

mean god

4037.44 --> 4043.2000000000003
is satan that's what a [ __ ] would say

that just can't get themselves to agree

it's like

i don't agree with that design decision

you don't wanna get that intelligence in

order to figure out why

4064.48 --> 4077.839
because it hurts yeah

4080.079 --> 4084.4
oh you understand exactly what i say

4082.72 --> 4090.72
well prove it then

4084.4 --> 4092.079
prove it then anton

4090.72 --> 4094.72
yeah because everything you're

4092.079 --> 4096.88
blabbering about now absolutely

4094.72 --> 4099.5599999999995
disproves that you understand

4096.88 --> 4101.04
because you're equivocating

4099.56 --> 4103.120000000001
frequency-based

4101.04 --> 4104.08
things that are absolutely real and

4103.12 --> 4107.12
solid

4104.08 --> 4107.6
to me it's in the spiritual realm but

4107.12 --> 4110.799
they are

solid things solid energy very clear and

4110.799 --> 4114.48
concise to me

4111.839 --> 4115.6
and you're equivocating what i just

4114.48 --> 4118.48
explained

4115.6 --> 4119.6
in control mechanisms like good is evil

4118.48 --> 4123.759
and evil is good

4123.759 --> 4130.56
do so no

4128.159 --> 4131.199
stop telling me yeah that's exactly what

4130.56 --> 4133.92
i'm saying

4131.199 --> 4136.879999999999
no you're not you're wrong you're doing

4133.92 --> 4138.96
exactly the opposite

4136.88 --> 4140.0
oh you're agreeing yeah well why don't

4138.96 --> 4143.44
you prove you're

4140.0 --> 4147.839

why are you [ __ ] why do you give a

whether the all the creator of all

4168.48 --> 4171.5199999999995

right see

4206.239 --> 4212.239
de la fila elfinor

4209.52 --> 4212.96
yeah now there's somebody that just one

4212.239 --> 4216.0
sentence

4212.96 --> 4219.04
is that simple either you

4216.0 --> 4221.12
get that or you reject that

4219.04 --> 4223.5199999999995
and then you start equificating again oh

4221.12 --> 4225.12
so that means good is evil and gevo is

4223.52 --> 4229.4400000000005
good

4225.12 --> 4230.5599999999995
no no it's not that person just said

4229.44 --> 4233.12
there

4230.56 --> 4234.56
that's what it is you don't understand

4233.12 --> 4237.599999999999
it you don't like it

4234.56 --> 4239.1990000000005
well too [ __ ] bad because that's what

4237.6 --> 4243.280000000001
it is

4239.199 --> 4245.759999999999
yeah that's right it's all a giant test

4243.28 --> 4247.04
there's it's all about growth about

4245.76 --> 4250.8
development

4247.04 --> 4255.199
challenge suffering pain enlightenment

4250.8 --> 4257.84
that comes there from that's what it is

4255.199 --> 4264.009999999999
if you don't get it you got a problem

4257.84 --> 4264.01
[Music]

4266.48 --> 4269.919999999999
since god is everything how was jesus

4268.48 --> 4272.959999999999
different from other people

4269.92 --> 4275.6
i don't know he just got it

4272.96 --> 4276.32
he just understood what the purpose is

4275.6 --> 4280.400000000001
he just

4276.32 --> 4283.5199999999995
saw super crystal clearly and understood

4280.4 --> 4286.239
what the design was how

4283.52 --> 4287.4400000000005
a person was supposed to live and he was

4286.239 --> 4290.799999999999
the example he

4287.44 --> 4291.199
decided i am the example i'm going to

4290.8 --> 4293.6
show

4291.199 --> 4296.08
everybody how you're supposed to do this

4293.6 --> 4299.6
and i'm going to do it in a way

4296.08 --> 4303.12
that it cannot be covered up

4299.6 --> 4304.0
it cannot be poo pooed away that's what

4303.12 --> 4308.4
jesus in

4304.0 --> 4308.4
some mystical way managed to do

4313.679 --> 4318.4800000000005
satan is a necessary evil or an

4316.32 --> 4322.88
inevitable evil

4318.48 --> 4326.48
ever consider that you call it necessary

4322.88 --> 4329.4400000000005
well what is necessity

4326.48 --> 4332.32
is it necessity basically another

4329.44 --> 4332.32
perspective on

4340.84 --> 4343.84
inevitable

4353.28 --> 4360.5599999999995
satan can be evil well what do you mean

4356.88 --> 4364.2390000000005
as an entity as a being

4360.56 --> 4367.679
is that evil is that relevant no satan

4364.239 --> 4370.239
what defines satan is the energy is the

4367.679 --> 4371.1990000000005
things the frequency that he utilizes

4370.239 --> 4375.5199999999995
that he

4371.199 --> 4376.159
is does that make the conscious if there

4375.52 --> 4379.1990000000005
even is

4376.159 --> 4380.32
such a thing the consciousness of satan

4379.199 --> 4384.4
evil

4380.32 --> 4386.96
uh is that relevant to anything

4384.4 --> 4387.5199999999995
or is the only thing really relevant is

4386.96 --> 4390.159
that

4387.52 --> 4392.2390000000005
the spirit is just counter opposite to

4390.159 --> 4394.4
logos every step sidestepping

4392.239 --> 4396.5599999999995
trying to evade logos trying to evade

4394.4 --> 4398.879999999999
god trying to forget about god

4396.56 --> 4401.04
trying to make everything forget and

4398.88 --> 4404.08
evade god

4401.04 --> 4407.76
is that the only thing that's relevant

4404.08 --> 4410.88
because like does it matter

4407.76 --> 4413.76
what somebody seems to be

4410.88 --> 4414.159000000001
like this idea of you are evil you are

4413.76 --> 4416.400000000001
good

4414.159 --> 4418.32
oh really so what if they changed their

4416.4 --> 4420.96
behavior all of a sudden

4418.32 --> 4421.92
what if they were hiding a reason to do

4420.96 --> 4425.36
that

4421.92 --> 4426.56
yeah well what then yeah then it changes

4425.36 --> 4429.5199999999995
doesn't it because

4426.56 --> 4430.159000000001
just declaring people good or evil is a

4429.52 --> 4433.84
very

4430.159 --> 4435.12
human short-sighted trait it's basically

4433.84 --> 4439.04
a decision

4435.12 --> 4441.12
making process put out in the open

4439.04 --> 4442.64
because people can decide like am i

4441.12 --> 4444.08
going to do something with this person

4442.64 --> 4446.96
or am i not

4444.08 --> 4447.679
depends depending on frequency analysis

4446.96 --> 4450.8
as it were

4447.679 --> 4454.2390000000005
and they say oh good evil that's

4450.8 --> 4456.64
just temporary judgment that's what it

4454.239 --> 4457.04
basically is it's a temporary judgment

4456.64 --> 4460.08
put

4457.04 --> 4462.56
out there as some kind of a tag

4460.08 --> 4463.28
as a stamp like this is good this is

4462.56 --> 4465.76
evil

4463.28 --> 4467.36
like that sticks like that means

4465.76 --> 4471.360000000001
anything on the long run

4467.36 --> 4474.5599999999995
right or any person you might do that to

4471.36 --> 4477.12
they have a history they have methods

4474.56 --> 4479.120000000001
and principles that they follow

4477.12 --> 4482.48
now those methods and principles and

4479.12 --> 4485.599999999999
that history might be drenched in sin

4482.48 --> 4487.919999999999
and evil but that does not mean

4485.6 --> 4489.92
that they are evil it just means they

4487.92 --> 4495.36
are set on a certain specific

4489.92 --> 4498.719
path which can be also into the darkness

4495.36 --> 4501.44
and that will be the thing testing them

4498.719 --> 4511.84
but how do they come out of it

4501.44 --> 4511.839999999999
you don't know until they do

4512.719 --> 4517.76
well that's cute andrew i'm glad you

4515.12 --> 4525.84
were there to witness that

4517.76 --> 4525.84
that you know that

4527.36 --> 4539.839999999999
hey hannah koala

4545.12 --> 4549.5199999999995
yes logos natural law homosexuality

4547.92 --> 4553.04
don't produce children it's worse than

4549.52 --> 4555.120000000001
that it's also

4553.04 --> 4558.56
it's not just about not being able to

4555.12 --> 4558.5599999999995
produce children it's about

4561.6 --> 4568.400000000001
changing the focus of the

4564.88 --> 4571.4400000000005
individual as to the function of sex

4568.4 --> 4571.44
it's also that

4572.719 --> 4576.32
and it's also the natural consequence of

4575.44 --> 4579.5199999999995
anal sex

4576.32 --> 4581.12
which is just very damaging not just

4579.52 --> 4584.96
spiritually

4581.12 --> 4588.88
it just creates physical damage

4584.96 --> 4591.92
and all those things combined yes

4588.88 --> 4595.04
that makes it a deviation from the path

4591.92 --> 4595.92
but because of the physical consequences

4595.04 --> 4599.199
because of the

4595.92 --> 4602.0
not because somebody says it some

4599.199 --> 4603.44
freaking tag it's just because of how

4602.0 --> 4609.6
creation works

4603.44 --> 4612.4
the natural consequences

4609.6 --> 4614.64
nobody has to point at it and say it's

4612.4 --> 4618.28
bad you can literally just

4614.64 --> 4619.679
let it run and then see the natural

4618.28 --> 4622.719
consequences that

4619.679 --> 4625.76
come there from

4622.719 --> 4625.76
it's that simple

4628.32 --> 4633.12
what's my thoughts on buddhism well what

4631.04 --> 4637.44
should my thoughts on buddhism be

4633.12 --> 4640.96
buddhism is buddhism let them be

4637.44 --> 4640.96
buddhists shall be buddhists

4641.6 --> 4646.719
they have some very wise mechanical

4645.199 --> 4649.199
teachings

4646.719 --> 4650.96
about how to deal with yourself and your

4649.199 --> 4653.599999999999
ego buddhism

4650.96 --> 4654.159
the biggest key about buddhism is it is

4653.6 --> 4656.88
a very

4654.159 --> 4657.5199999999995
introspective way of learning to deal

4656.88 --> 4661.04
with

4657.52 --> 4663.6
the almost impossible ego

4661.04 --> 4664.719
but it is not the ultimate solution in

4663.6 --> 4667.6
my opinion

4664.719 --> 4668.2390000000005
because it neutralizes a little too much

4667.6 --> 4671.679
now

4668.239 --> 4672.4
i don't know whether it's some kind of

4671.679 --> 4675.28
trap

4672.4 --> 4677.5199999999995
like that because i'm not going there

4675.28 --> 4678.159
it's not my path it's not the way i do

4677.52 --> 4680.64
things

4678.159 --> 4683.04
i have too much passion to ever become a

4680.64 --> 4685.04
true buddhist

4683.04 --> 4686.64
that doesn't mean that i have not

4685.04 --> 4690.0
detected wise

4686.64 --> 4693.84
lessons within its teachings that i am

4690.0 --> 4693.84
trying to take to heart

4696.96 --> 4703.679
so that's my thoughts on buddhism

4700.239 --> 4707.839999999999
it's not perfect nothing out there is

4703.679 --> 4707.84
but it has some good lessons

4719.28 --> 4723.92
do you respect jesus in buddha well that

4721.76 --> 4727.1990000000005
doesn't mean anything

4723.92 --> 4729.84
after everything you've said yeah

4727.199 --> 4731.36
if you'd respect jesus then you would

4729.84 --> 4734.4800000000005
not have said those things

4731.36 --> 4737.599999999999
because those things are just lies

4734.48 --> 4737.599999999999
atheist lies

4738.08 --> 4741.5199999999995
lying is not a sign of respect even if

4740.719 --> 4744.88
you don't

4741.52 --> 4744.88
know you're lying

4747.44 --> 4752.32
when you don't understand can't really

4760.84 --> 4763.84
respect

4774.84 --> 4780.400000000001
fine

4776.96 --> 4781.679
i don't think you need to at this point

4780.4 --> 4785.36
anton

4781.679 --> 4788.4800000000005
you've explained yourself very clearly

4785.36 --> 4789.199
and i already am able to size you up for

4788.48 --> 4792.5599999999995
the

4789.199 --> 4793.36
level and sources of knowledge that you

4792.56 --> 4797.52
have

4793.36 --> 4800.88
because i've heard a lot

4797.52 --> 4803.6
i can basically spiritually triangulate

4800.88 --> 4806.159000000001
where you got your data from how it

4803.6 --> 4808.96
worked on you

4806.159 --> 4810.159
and where you're at now i have that

4808.96 --> 4812.4
ability

4810.159 --> 4814.5599999999995
to roughly size that up i'm very good at

4812.4 --> 4814.5599999999995
it

4816.84 --> 4823.1990000000005
so there's nothing you need to say

4820.0 --> 4824.96
to explain yourself any further it

4823.199 --> 4828.48
doesn't mean that you cannot com

4824.96 --> 4828.4800000000005
continue the conversation

4831.04 --> 4834.639
i'm just saying i don't need any

4844.84 --> 4847.84
clarifications

4851.679 --> 4860.56
what the hell it's not tuesday

4855.36 --> 4865.04
the [ __ ]

4860.56 --> 4865.04
yeah andrew uh it's saturday it's not

4872.84 --> 4875.84
tuesday

4877.06 --> 4880.1990000000005
[Music]

4893.679 --> 4899.4400000000005
you use your associations exactly what

4897.199 --> 4901.919999999999
you say now which is wrong unfortunately

4899.44 --> 4902.96
no no it's not wrong it's frequency

4901.92 --> 4906.88
based and it's not

4902.96 --> 4908.96
wrong this is called at the esoteric

4906.88 --> 4912.400000000001
approach and i'm very good at it

4908.96 --> 4918.159
you can't just say that's wrong

4912.4 --> 4918.159
that's an insult because it's not wrong

4918.639 --> 4922.400000000001
i know where these trains of thinking

4921.52 --> 4926.080000000001
come from

4922.4 --> 4928.48
they all come from the same things

4926.08 --> 4931.5199999999995
and when you let those things rub off on

4928.48 --> 4934.638999999999
you that will determine

4931.52 --> 4936.639
how the crystalline pattern of your

4934.639 --> 4940.719
thoughts unfold over time

4936.639 --> 4943.6
it always does always

4940.719 --> 4944.08
oh i'm jesus then now i'm timing you out

4943.6 --> 4959.84
for

4944.08 --> 4959.84
ridiculous blasphemy

4960.239 --> 4966.0
see so so you really think that you get

4963.36 --> 4968.719
me and you say something like that

4966.0 --> 4971.84
see no no you are not here to

4968.719 --> 4974.88
intellectually develop yourself you are

4971.84 --> 4976.8
to bring in back the ego and try to make

4974.88 --> 4977.4400000000005
some sense out of this and find some

4976.8 --> 4981.52
peace

4977.44 --> 4981.5199999999995
or you would not say such ridiculous

4984.84 --> 4989.360000000001
statements

4986.719 --> 4990.4
no i'm not gonna read the freaking manly

4989.36 --> 4992.96
p hall book

4990.4 --> 4992.96
thanks

4995.04 --> 5000.4
i don't need to why would i need to read

4998.0 --> 5002.4
that i already get the interdimensional

5000.4 --> 5004.32
patterns i already get the structure i

5002.4 --> 5005.44
already get the fractal nature of

5004.32 --> 5008.48
reality

5005.44 --> 5008.48
i get it a lot

5009.84 --> 5017.1990000000005
i don't need to read that crap like i

5013.76 --> 5018.88
that book was disgusting it just was a

5017.199 --> 5024.0
bunch of

5018.88 --> 5024.0
arrogant squirting it really was

5025.04 --> 5032.4
just so arrogant it's like oh

5028.719 --> 5032.96
oh we see it we're smart enough to see

5032.4 --> 5035.839999999999
it

5032.96 --> 5037.92
that means it's okay to be an arrogant

5035.84 --> 5042.08
piece of [ __ ]

5037.92 --> 5046.08
yeah that's what that guy was doing

5042.08 --> 5048.8
that's what they do we're smart enough

5046.08 --> 5050.48
that means we can be an arrogant piece

5048.8 --> 5053.52
of [ __ ]

5050.48 --> 5056.799999999999
and not respect anyone anymore

5053.52 --> 5059.92
and decide over them like like

5056.8 --> 5062.56
ranchers decide over cattle right

5059.92 --> 5064.32
they all think that they can do it

5062.56 --> 5066.400000000001
because they're smart enough to see it

5064.32 --> 5070.799999999999
yeah that's the big one that's the

5066.4 --> 5074.08
big big mistake

5070.8 --> 5076.6
and that's the ego doing that because

5074.08 --> 5078.5599999999995
they're not ready to take the

5076.6 --> 5081.84
responsibility to actually

5078.56 --> 5084.8
consume the pain

5081.84 --> 5085.76
that comes with intelligence so instead

5084.8 --> 5089.4400000000005
they choose to

5085.76 --> 5092.4800000000005
mask it with arrogant delusion

5089.44 --> 5099.839999999999
yeah that's what's happening there and

5092.48 --> 5099.839999999999
that's the big problem

5103.36 --> 5107.36
no i'm not unbanning him i don't ever

5106.639 --> 5112.400000000001
want to see

5107.36 --> 5113.44
his disgusting [ __ ] face again or hear

5112.4 --> 5117.28
his voice or

5113.44 --> 5117.28
see his stupid chat messages

5119.92 --> 5125.36
and i advise everyone to block him

5122.639 --> 5129.28
because he will just keep on whining

5125.36 --> 5129.28
and whining and whining

5132.08 --> 5135.679
he needs to [ __ ] off

5138.96 --> 5142.719
not don't mind that you're relaying

5142.08 --> 5145.84
messages

5142.719 --> 5155.12
it's just that yeah this guy

5145.84 --> 5157.04
just needs to [ __ ] off that's it

5155.12 --> 5159.199
you would like to talk well you i would

5157.04 --> 5169.84
like to kick his ass

5159.199 --> 5169.839999999999
how about that

5182.32 --> 5186.159
right do you understand hannah koala and

5184.8 --> 5189.28
everybody else i am

5186.159 --> 5192.799999999999
never unbanning that scumbag traitor

5189.28 --> 5194.159
ever i don't care what his stupid little

5192.8 --> 5196.4800000000005
plans were

5194.159 --> 5198.239
and that he thought he was some kind of

5196.48 --> 5201.759999999999
infiltrator or whatever i

5198.239 --> 5202.48
directly addressed him i directly told

5201.76 --> 5206.719
him

5202.48 --> 5208.4
don't do this this is unacceptable and

5206.719 --> 5211.6
he did it anyway he did

5208.4 --> 5214.719
all of it anyway and i literally just

5211.6 --> 5216.2390000000005
cast him to hell i told you you are a

5214.719 --> 5220.0
traitor

5216.239 --> 5222.08
i cursed you to hell steven

5220.0 --> 5223.12
and he do you know what he said you were

5222.08 --> 5226.08
squirting well

5223.12 --> 5226.88
[ __ ] you go [ __ ] die in a ditch

5226.08 --> 5229.679
somewhere

5226.88 --> 5230.639
i don't give a [ __ ] about this guy ever

5229.679 --> 5233.84
again

5230.639 --> 5235.679
okay he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] delusional

5233.84 --> 5240.0
piece of [ __ ]

5235.679 --> 5243.6
he's literally dumb and i'm done with it

5240.0 --> 5248.719
he [ __ ] recorded me without

5243.6 --> 5251.360000000001
telling me in a private call okay

5248.719 --> 5252.0
and now he supposedly even shared that

5251.36 --> 5255.679
with other

5252.0 --> 5256.48
people it's such a brutal violation of

5255.679 --> 5259.36
privacy

5256.48 --> 5261.36
and trust and friendship i shared

5259.36 --> 5263.28
vulnerable moments with this guy

5261.36 --> 5265.88
and without telling me he [ __ ]

5263.28 --> 5268.5599999999995
recorded it like a total

5265.88 --> 5274.32
scumbag i don't give a

5268.56 --> 5274.320000000001
[ __ ] about him he needs to [ __ ] off

5278.84 --> 5281.84
forever

5285.92 --> 5289.679
does god want us to forgive

5290.88 --> 5296.08
do i care i'll [ __ ] forgive whenever

5294.4 --> 5298.239
i feel like it

5296.08 --> 5299.28
and if i don't feel like forgiving then

5298.239 --> 5301.919999999999
i don't

5299.28 --> 5303.28
and if i suffer for it then god does

5301.92 --> 5306.32
want me to forgive

5303.28 --> 5309.5199999999995
and then i will eventually forgive or

5306.32 --> 5312.239
i will just hang on to it for a lifetime

5309.52 --> 5313.6
if god doesn't mind me to do that as

5312.239 --> 5316.32
much

5313.6 --> 5317.360000000001
so i just follow logos i just follow

5316.32 --> 5320.0
whatever the

5317.36 --> 5323.839999999999
physical reality and my spirit reveals

5320.0 --> 5323.84
is the way i'm supposed to do things

5331.679 --> 5334.719
yeah i think that the monologue thing is

5333.679 --> 5338.159
just a gag

5334.719 --> 5341.199
it's just people trying to

5338.159 --> 5344.4
get everybody squirting

5341.199 --> 5347.44
like if there is ever a freemason

5344.4 --> 5348.879999999999
little media scam thing trickery

5347.44 --> 5352.799999999999
then it's that it's the freaking

5348.88 --> 5352.8
monoliths seriously come on

5353.84 --> 5358.88
the coming reset yeah yeah they're all

5356.48 --> 5359.28
putting all their powers all together

5358.88 --> 5361.6
because

5359.28 --> 5364.0
they want the reset the reset where

5361.6 --> 5366.96
everybody switches off their mind

5364.0 --> 5370.08

5527.679 --> 5534.88
left i'd rather have it tortured

5531.6 --> 5538.96
inside of me forever then to

5534.88 --> 5542.32
actually give in to that pettiness

5538.96 --> 5545.679
forgive them when they just blatantly

5542.32 --> 5546.639
disrespected me in a way that cannot be

5545.679 --> 5549.52
justified

5546.639 --> 5550.88
that cannot be evened out that cannot be

5549.52 --> 5554.8
made all right

5550.88 --> 5561.84
no just means [ __ ] off

5554.8 --> 5561.84
forever that's what that means

5577.84 --> 5584.400000000001
yep sucker punch and i no doubt

5580.88 --> 5589.6
people will be talking about it in 2050

5584.4 --> 5594.638999999999
and 2080. all those georgia guide stones

5589.6 --> 5596.56
oh dude in 2040 people are going to

5594.639 --> 5599.04
realize that the entire stat

5596.56 --> 5600.4800000000005
numbers of world population is giant

5599.04 --> 5603.84
scam

5600.48 --> 5603.839999999999
that is just all [ __ ]

5607.52 --> 5610.639
i don't even think there's that many

5609.199 --> 5612.96
people

5610.639 --> 5614.2390000000005
i think there's probably a lot less and

5612.96 --> 5617.44
there might be

5614.239 --> 5618.159
regions where it's concentrated it's

5617.44 --> 5621.199
just that

5618.159 --> 5622.799999999999
i think that the idea of overpopulation

5621.199 --> 5625.678999999999
is a eugenics myth

5622.8 --> 5628.8
i think it's a complete fabricated lie

5625.679 --> 5631.76
to create a persistent culture

5628.8 --> 5633.679
of destroying humanity because we have

5631.76 --> 5636.88
to because it's growing out of control

5633.679 --> 5637.76
i think it's all a lie everything about

5636.88 --> 5641.1990000000005
it

5637.76 --> 5644.88
it's 100 percent lie

5641.199 --> 5648.0
population isn't growing out of control

5644.88 --> 5650.96
i think it's all a lie

5648.0 --> 5651.679
a lie that just some people can't let go

5650.96 --> 5655.04
of

5651.679 --> 5656.159
they can't let it go ever they don't

5655.04 --> 5659.28
want to let it go

5656.159 --> 5663.04
they've already made moves

5659.28 --> 5666.08
in order to honor that lie

5663.04 --> 5667.199
and they can never undo that so they can

5666.08 --> 5669.679
never let go of

5667.199 --> 5670.719
eugenics they just have to accept all

5669.679 --> 5673.1990000000005
these lies about

5670.719 --> 5675.92
overpopulation they can never let it go

5673.199 --> 5675.919999999999
ever again

5676.719 --> 5679.679
it's all a lie

5682.08 --> 5687.84

5712.0 --> 5716.32
it's completely [ __ ] if you really

5714.159 --> 5719.92
think that's gonna happen

5716.32 --> 5719.92

i'm really wondering like how can you

5759.36 --> 5765.92
just let that roll out it's so dumb

5762.96 --> 5767.679
so [ __ ] dumb you can't be seriously

5765.92 --> 5769.28
thinking that anything about that is

5767.679 --> 5774.639
real

5769.28 --> 5774.639
serious how can you say something like

5782.84 --> 5786.719
that

5784.639 --> 5788.159000000001
right and it's a really dumb thing to

5786.719 --> 5793.119
repeat

5788.159 --> 5793.119
it's really dumb to say that

5796.96 --> 5800.719
you know you do realize right that a lot

5799.84 --> 5803.360000000001
of people

5800.719 --> 5805.119
a lot of globers out there have been

5803.36 --> 5808.5599999999995
whining on

5805.119 --> 5809.28
about every possible disgusting angle to

5808.56 --> 5812.159000000001
somehow

5809.28 --> 5813.28
take down his channel with nathan oakley

5812.159 --> 5817.679
you could this for

5813.28 --> 5820.0
years the four years of that [ __ ]

5817.679 --> 5821.28
all right four years like it's going to

5820.0 --> 5824.8
be arrested as

5821.28 --> 5828.5599999999995
child abuser this that

5824.8 --> 5831.28
never nothing ever if you i

5828.56 --> 5833.119000000001
repeat anything of that it's a sign that

5831.28 --> 5836.0
you're really [ __ ] dumb

5833.119 --> 5837.839999999999
so that really disappoints me that you

5836.0 --> 5841.84
say that it's really dumb

5837.84 --> 5841.84
i can't believe you said that

5850.96 --> 5858.4800000000005
yeah wow goodbye indeed

5855.679 --> 5859.92
you can come back but don't ever ask

5858.48 --> 5868.638999999999
something that stupid

5859.92 --> 5870.96
again serious

5868.639 --> 5874.2390000000005
you're having a bad day sucker punch

5870.96 --> 5876.4800000000005
well i'm having a very loud day

5874.239 --> 5878.799999999999
i'm very pissed off with a lot of things

5876.48 --> 5880.4
and i'm pissed off with myself for kind

5878.8 --> 5884.0
of

5880.4 --> 5884.638999999999
getting sleepy i don't like being sleepy

5884.0 --> 5890.4
i want to be

5884.639 --> 5893.84
loud and angry and direct and merciless

5890.4 --> 5897.599999999999
because mercy is for the weak

5893.84 --> 5901.1990000000005
and i want people to not be weak

5897.6 --> 5903.76
so i feel like basically whenever

5901.199 --> 5905.5199999999995
somebody says something stupid i feel

5903.76 --> 5908.159000000001
like assaulting them

5905.52 --> 5910.0
with the direct and honest truth and

5908.159 --> 5913.199
yeah that may seem like a bit of an

5910.0 --> 5916.0
insult an assault an insult

5913.199 --> 5918.879999999999
so earth passenger may think like oh wow

5916.0 --> 5921.84
i did not deserve that at all

5918.88 --> 5923.28
well i explain exactly why i thought the

5921.84 --> 5926.639
way that i did

5923.28 --> 5927.599999999999
like you should know better than to buy

5926.639 --> 5931.119
any of those

5927.6 --> 5931.119000000001
stupid level rumors

5935.199 --> 5939.839999999999
so i'm getting a little excited about

5937.04 --> 5939.84
that

5953.44 --> 5969.119
yeah there are stupid questions

5966.239 --> 5970.32
i have raw emotions raw emotions

5969.119 --> 5973.679
frustrations

5970.32 --> 5977.119
it's just i'm sick of being low energy

5973.679 --> 5978.159
i want more energy and every time i get

5977.119 --> 5981.759999999999
pissed off

5978.159 --> 5983.839999999999
it happens so i don't know man

5981.76 --> 5986.08
it's just that walking eggshells is

5983.84 --> 5988.4800000000005
starting to really suck

5986.08 --> 5989.84
i've never really done it animate too

5988.48 --> 5991.919999999999
much

5989.84 --> 5994.08
but now i'm just like no let's just

5991.92 --> 5994.8
freaking stomp the [ __ ] out of these

5994.08 --> 5998.159
eggs

5994.8 --> 6001.360000000001
like just break them all that's kind of

5998.159 --> 6001.36
how i feel right now

6005.199 --> 6008.5599999999995
and yeah i'm probably gonna piss off a

6007.199 --> 6011.5199999999995
whole bunch of people

6008.56 --> 6012.080000000001
that were absolutely not ready for that

6011.52 --> 6014.8
because

6012.08 --> 6015.44
hey a lot of you even like earth

6014.8 --> 6018.320000000001
passenger

6015.44 --> 6019.199
they've sat through me being very angry

6018.32 --> 6021.44
and [ __ ]

6019.199 --> 6022.239
and they appreciated it back then and

6021.44 --> 6024.799999999999
then i

6022.239 --> 6026.239
got used to me slowing down a little

6024.8 --> 6029.360000000001
getting more calmer

6026.239 --> 6031.919999999999
being more reasonable

6029.36 --> 6033.759999999999
and then yeah it happens a lot that

6031.92 --> 6036.639
people that get used to that when i

6033.76 --> 6037.76
suddenly get really pissed off again

6036.639 --> 6040.639
they think

6037.76 --> 6042.719
that's unreasonable i do not deserve

6040.639 --> 6043.84
this i don't want this anymore and then

6042.719 --> 6046.4
they go away

6043.84 --> 6048.0
and there's nothing i can do about it

6046.4 --> 6050.0
it's the eggs that break

6048.0 --> 6051.44
and people just drop off and they don't

6050.0 --> 6055.52
want to come back

6051.44 --> 6055.5199999999995
it's too bad it's the way it is

6057.04 --> 6062.0
oh well hey how about you go [ __ ]

6059.679 --> 6065.84
yourself you [ __ ] scumbag don't

6062.0 --> 6065.84
[ __ ] tell me what to do you little

6076.84 --> 6080.56
[ __ ]

6078.32 --> 6093.84
of course i will attract provocation and

6080.56 --> 6093.84
i will [ __ ] them up

6095.44 --> 6101.36
there are no stupid questions really

6098.159 --> 6103.679
there are no stupid questions yeah

6101.36 --> 6105.119
yeah no you know what that's not an

6103.679 --> 6108.32
absolute truth

6105.119 --> 6111.839999999999
it's just a trope that

6108.32 --> 6115.84
teachers that deal with students

6111.84 --> 6119.1990000000005
that don't feel like opening up too much

6115.84 --> 6120.719
that's what they say they kind of soften

6119.199 --> 6123.919999999999
the grounds for their

6120.719 --> 6124.88
hard to open up students to maybe ask a

6123.92 --> 6127.52
question that they

6124.88 --> 6128.8
feel might make them look stupid right

6127.52 --> 6132.400000000001
that's what that is

6128.8 --> 6135.1990000000005
doesn't mean it's literal you're [ __ ]

6132.4 --> 6137.28
yeah there are [ __ ] stupid questions

6135.199 --> 6148.719
yes there are

6137.28 --> 6153.119
it's not an absolute statement idiot

6148.719 --> 6153.119
do i ever have guests nah rarely

6159.76 --> 6165.76
because i [ __ ] feel like it elminator

6162.8 --> 6177.84
because i feel like being angry how

6165.76 --> 6177.84
about that

6185.28 --> 6189.119

6205.92 --> 6209.76

6208.159 --> 6211.599999999999
in general

6209.76 --> 6214.08
like that guy's got some serious

6211.6 --> 6217.1990000000005
problems

6214.08 --> 6218.0
biggest one is that he's originally had

6217.199 --> 6220.719
a great idea

6218.0 --> 6221.52
and then he just never develops then in

6220.719 --> 6224.32
the course of

6221.52 --> 6225.1990000000005
five years but still managed to whine

6224.32 --> 6233.84
about it to

6225.199 --> 6233.839999999999
everyone without developing the theories

6234.32 --> 6238.239
and i tried i tried at some point like a

6236.88 --> 6240.8
couple of years ago to

6238.239 --> 6241.599999999999
basically talk like even on a stream

6240.8 --> 6244.159000000001
with pga

6241.6 --> 6244.8
and i addressed all these things and he

6244.159 --> 6247.44
would just

6244.8 --> 6248.96
start squirting he would just like you

6247.44 --> 6249.678999999999
don't do this you do blah blah blah blah

6248.96 --> 6251.44

6251.44 --> 6256.5599999999995
don't understand the blah blah yeah

6253.36 --> 6258.08
no it's complete waste he's not going to

6256.56 --> 6260.4800000000005
develop his tears he's just going to

6258.08 --> 6262.639
blabber on like he always does

6260.48 --> 6264.08
the same [ __ ] over and over and over

6262.639 --> 6266.08
again and everybody's just chill

6264.08 --> 6266.96
everybody's an agent and everybody's a

6266.08 --> 6270.32
transsexual

6266.96 --> 6275.84
and it's always the same [ __ ] with him

6270.32 --> 6275.84
every single time

6288.719 --> 6295.44
yeah that's right i try to

6292.48 --> 6303.839999999999
and exactly what you said and so i'm not

6295.44 --> 6303.839999999999
gonna waste my time with that anymore

6306.159 --> 6311.199
maybe we are not ready well maybe he's

6308.639 --> 6313.84
no longer ready maybe his doors have

6311.199 --> 6315.759999999999
closed he's just not developing any

6313.84 --> 6318.8
further

6315.76 --> 6321.679
he saw aristarchus he thought i

6318.8 --> 6322.4800000000005
knew it all and then he freaking closed

6321.679 --> 6325.119
the doors

6322.48 --> 6326.08
and he can't open them back up again

6325.119 --> 6331.44
nobody can

6326.08 --> 6334.48
that's what i think is going on in pga

6331.44 --> 6337.678999999999
all right anyway

6334.48 --> 6338.959999999999
i'll be back for an afternoon another 15

6337.679 --> 6345.84
minutes of show

6338.96 --> 6345.84
so stay there

6426.84 --> 6429.84
hmm

6454.84 --> 6457.84
right

6459.44 --> 6462.638999999999
what we've all tried here blocked me now

6462.159 --> 6467.759999999999
what

6462.639 --> 6467.76
are we talking about here i mean jam

6468.84 --> 6471.84
panna

6474.159 --> 6478.08
that the thing with real truth is it

6477.28 --> 6480.32
feels true

6478.08 --> 6483.36
that's interesting that's a very

6480.32 --> 6486.5599999999995
esoteric statement

6483.36 --> 6486.5599999999995
and i i agree

6490.32 --> 6493.5199999999995
but it's difficult though

6494.4 --> 6498.159
because you can still hold things true

6497.28 --> 6501.28
and then it might

6498.159 --> 6502.159
not ring true but it'll ring true to

6501.28 --> 6504.0
your heart

6502.159 --> 6506.48
and then you might mistake that for the

6504.0 --> 6509.6
truth that it's just the temporary

6506.48 --> 6512.959999999999
truth of your

6509.6 --> 6516.2390000000005
pursuit basically

6512.96 --> 6516.2390000000005
it's complicated like that

6518.96 --> 6525.6
right yeah delphi

6522.88 --> 6525.6
de la

6528.96 --> 6536.32
right you have a complicated

6532.159 --> 6538.08
knife but he's always hinting at the

6536.32 --> 6541.04
greater truth

6538.08 --> 6543.119
he's just pointing at some place where

6541.04 --> 6545.92
he can't reach

6543.119 --> 6547.759999999999
because it's great it's big to him that

6545.92 --> 6548.08
but he's always pointing at things that

6547.76 --> 6551.1990000000005
he's

6548.08 --> 6551.76
that is out of reach because that's just

6551.199 --> 6555.839999999999
the way

6551.76 --> 6555.84
he does things now

6562.56 --> 6569.84
hey tarik 306 good to see you

6571.73 --> 6575.36
[Music]

6580.84 --> 6585.1990000000005
so

6582.639 --> 6587.36
has anybody seen around guns of nephron

6585.199 --> 6590.638999999999
rmp

6587.36 --> 6593.44
i'm still kind of weirded out

6590.639 --> 6596.96
by that comment he made and i haven't

6593.44 --> 6599.04
seen him around since then

6596.96 --> 6600.8
i hope he's not like really angry with

6599.04 --> 6604.639
me now all of a sudden

6600.8 --> 6604.639
i just didn't even understand why

6609.04 --> 6617.28
what comment i don't know like

6612.8 --> 6620.320000000001
he was a couple of shows ago

6617.28 --> 6622.08
and i think he got angry he said in that

6620.32 --> 6623.5199999999995
comment it was deleted like i couldn't

6622.08 --> 6625.28
respond to it so he deleted

6623.52 --> 6626.88
himself perhaps but he was basically

6625.28 --> 6630.239
saying like he was

6626.88 --> 6633.04
like how why aren't we supposed to go

6630.239 --> 6635.44
after these people like he was probably

6633.04 --> 6638.48
really fed up with the

6635.44 --> 6641.5199999999995
elites that have basically

6638.48 --> 6643.04
that have designed the plan of how to

6641.52 --> 6644.56
corrupt the world

6643.04 --> 6646.96
and i think that in that moment i was

6644.56 --> 6649.92
emphasizing on like how you karmically

6646.96 --> 6652.32
cannot actually do that

6649.92 --> 6653.52
you can only just help prevent other

6652.32 --> 6656.48
people

6653.52 --> 6656.8
from allowing themselves to be corrupted

6656.48 --> 6659.919999999999
by

6656.8 --> 6662.400000000001
it and he probably did not like that at

6659.92 --> 6662.4
the moment

6665.679 --> 6669.76
was that guns what

6670.8 --> 6676.88
it was guns of nephron rmp that made

6673.04 --> 6676.88
those comments i'm pretty sure it was

6679.199 --> 6684.638999999999
and he rarely makes a comment in my

6681.44 --> 6684.638999999999
comment section anyway

6686.83 --> 6692.32
[Music]

6689.04 --> 6692.32
hey michael smithgrass

6692.639 --> 6696.4800000000005
did i scare off guns i don't think

6694.639 --> 6702.08
anybody scares guns off

6696.48 --> 6702.08
he's a pretty solid guy

6706.0 --> 6709.84
i'm just hoping he's doing all right

6711.84 --> 6715.04
and i yeah i would like to understand

6714.4 --> 6718.32
better

6715.04 --> 6720.32
what he was pissed off about it could be

6718.32 --> 6722.48
that he just

6720.32 --> 6724.639
that he deleted the message because at

6722.48 --> 6725.44
first he totally disagreed with what i

6724.639 --> 6728.639
said and then

6725.44 --> 6729.759999999999
later on as i explained further he might

6728.639 --> 6731.36
have caught on

6729.76 --> 6733.76
the wisdom of what i was trying to

6731.36 --> 6736.239
convey and then deleted the message

6733.76 --> 6738.08
i will still see it pop up in the

6736.239 --> 6741.36
recommended or in the

6738.08 --> 6742.4
in the activities in the notifications

6741.36 --> 6744.88
of youtube

6742.4 --> 6750.0
but yeah again when i clicked on it

6744.88 --> 6753.76
there was nothing there

6750.0 --> 6756.8
right he said like hang all astronauts

6753.76 --> 6760.0
he was really disappointed in me

6756.8 --> 6762.56
saying that they might have a a function

6760.0 --> 6762.56
or something

6762.8 --> 6768.0
and against the masons so i don't know

6772.239 --> 6775.44
i don't know why he would think that i

6774.159 --> 6779.119
am like oh

6775.44 --> 6782.159
we are going to work towards

6779.119 --> 6785.5199999999995
removing a certain group of people

6782.159 --> 6785.5199999999995
like the entire thing

6785.76 --> 6793.84
i i never really been like that

6789.76 --> 6793.84
like not even with freaking globers

6794.08 --> 6799.679
i've always tried to prevent getting

6797.119 --> 6801.28
put into polarized camps that are just

6799.679 --> 6807.84
at war with another camp

6801.28 --> 6807.84
always try to avoid that at all costs

6807.92 --> 6815.04
so i don't know maybe guns just

6812.719 --> 6817.199
started to realize that in that moment

6815.04 --> 6819.5199999999995
and really did not like it i don't know

6817.199 --> 6821.678999999999
i would like him to actually get in my

6819.52 --> 6835.84
chat and address it maybe

6821.679 --> 6835.84
okay let's talk this through

6841.679 --> 6846.2390000000005
yeah or maybe he kind of snapped and

6844.48 --> 6849.04
just dropped

6846.239 --> 6851.28
like didn't is off the internet for a

6849.04 --> 6851.28
while

6852.48 --> 6863.839999999999
that could also be it's kind of the time

6855.44 --> 6863.839999999999
of the year

6866.719 --> 6871.84
right but yeah guns and neuron also has

6869.44 --> 6873.44
been a great sponsor of mine so if that

6871.84 --> 6875.4400000000005
means that he's now certainly not going

6873.44 --> 6878.48
to sponsor me anymore

6875.44 --> 6879.119
that's gonna be a gap that's not good

6878.48 --> 6882.159
that's like

6879.119 --> 6884.96
that's a real punishment and that's why

6882.159 --> 6884.96
i'm saying like

6886.639 --> 6892.88
like can we at least talk about it

6890.4 --> 6895.119
like if he certainly is incapable of

6892.88 --> 6898.88
sponsoring me

6895.119 --> 6901.119
then i would just like to know that

6898.88 --> 6902.4800000000005
and not feel like i'm being punished for

6901.119 --> 6918.88
having said something

6902.48 --> 6933.839999999999
wrong or something

6918.88 --> 6933.84
all right

6952.719 --> 6963.36
or not maybe it's just

6961.199 --> 6965.04
a lot of people are moving on they've

6963.36 --> 6965.759999999999
just had their feel of our win and

6965.04 --> 6968.8
they're just

6965.76 --> 6969.92
going away and i'll just have to fend

6968.8 --> 6973.4400000000005
for myself

6969.92 --> 6975.76
that could also be maybe the

6973.44 --> 6977.36
two-hour stream wasn't working out for

6975.76 --> 6980.400000000001
guns if never on rmp

6977.36 --> 6980.88
i think i remember he said before that

6980.4 --> 6983.679
like

6980.88 --> 6984.719
that two hours was kind of a chore so

6983.679 --> 6987.1990000000005
maybe that is

6984.719 --> 6989.599
partly an influence i don't know i won't

6987.199 --> 6992.239
know until he actually communicates with

6989.599 --> 6992.2390000000005
me about it

6997.36 --> 7000.4
forgive your enemies but remember their

6999.44 --> 7004.4
names

7000.4 --> 7004.4
right forgive but never forget

7004.639 --> 7008.56
and even forgive is a bigger it's a big

7007.119 --> 7010.96
word

7008.56 --> 7010.96
it's like

7014.719 --> 7020.88
like unless it specifically means

7018.4 --> 7023.638999999999
don't go attack your enemies as a

7020.88 --> 7028.400000000001
retribution don't go out and on

7023.639 --> 7031.04
retribution actions but don't forget

7028.4 --> 7033.119
the violations that's another way of

7031.04 --> 7035.5199999999995
saying that

7033.119 --> 7036.48
because forgiving is a big thing you

7035.52 --> 7038.96
know

7036.48 --> 7040.48
like is it even possible to forgive

7038.96 --> 7042.8
somebody

7040.48 --> 7045.119
what if you forgave somebody when they

7042.8 --> 7046.2390000000005
haven't actually even given you the full

7045.119 --> 7048.719
truth yet

7046.239 --> 7051.04
what do you do then right right do you

7048.719 --> 7052.88
take back the forgives

7051.04 --> 7054.239
that doesn't make a lot of damn sense

7052.88 --> 7056.84
right so

7054.239 --> 7058.32
you know it's complicated like that but

7056.84 --> 7060.719
anyway

7058.32 --> 7062.5599999999995
i understand the train of thought and

7060.719 --> 7066.0
thank you for the two pound super chat

7062.56 --> 7066.0
donation i appreciate that

7067.92 --> 7076.0
carrying hate is baggage yes

7072.96 --> 7078.88
but is that forgiving or is it just

7076.0 --> 7078.88
letting it go

7080.4 --> 7086.48
like forgiving is like to me

7083.44 --> 7091.919999999999
is basically like scrubbing somebody

7086.48 --> 7094.959999999999
clean from their actions towards you

7091.92 --> 7094.96
i don't do that

7096.8 --> 7103.4400000000005
i try not to

7100.32 --> 7105.759999999999
i used to do that a lot and ended up

7103.44 --> 7108.08
with a lot of people that

7105.76 --> 7110.639
absolutely did not respect me in the

7108.08 --> 7113.5199999999995
slightest and would literally

7110.639 --> 7114.0
count on me doing that in order to play

7113.52 --> 7117.599
games

7114.0 --> 7117.599
with me you understand

7122.159 --> 7125.839999999999
so yeah it's a saying but it's a bit of

7125.199 --> 7127.839999999999
a trope

7125.84 --> 7129.1990000000005
and the reality is a little bit more

7127.84 --> 7132.08
complicated than that

7129.199 --> 7132.08
for me at least

7138.159 --> 7145.92
right anyway i'm rounding out the show

7142.56 --> 7149.04
it was pretty intense got very

7145.92 --> 7150.719
angry at points i like that

7149.04 --> 7152.8
i'll probably watch this one back and

7150.719 --> 7155.599
enjoy it sounds really weird doesn't it

7152.8 --> 7158.4800000000005
but when i get really pissed off

7155.599 --> 7159.360000000001
at the screen i never do it without good

7158.48 --> 7161.839999999999
cause i

7159.36 --> 7163.759999999999
always get pissed off for a good reason

7161.84 --> 7164.2390000000005
i never get pissed off for no good

7163.76 --> 7167.92
reason

7164.239 --> 7167.919999999999
i hope you guys agree on that

7168.84 --> 7174.4800000000005
because yeah those things are very

7171.92 --> 7174.96
serious to me it's not just a running

7174.48 --> 7177.44
joke

7174.96 --> 7178.08
or something that i do because it draws

7177.44 --> 7181.759999999999
attention

7178.08 --> 7185.04
it's all real and

7181.76 --> 7188.2390000000005
i appreciate often watching it back

7185.04 --> 7188.239
the real passion of it

7189.28 --> 7192.8
