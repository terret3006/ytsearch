[Music]

67.28 --> 69.68
good

68.64 --> 71.84
morning

69.68 --> 73.52000000000001
welcome to flat earth early bird number

71.84 --> 75.92
983

73.52 --> 78.0
i'm your host irwin and before we start

75.92 --> 80.56
the show please don't forget to share it

78.0 --> 82.64
on any platform you deem fit and if you

80.56 --> 84.799
haven't already subscribe to my channel

82.64 --> 87.2
hit the bell notification so you know

84.799 --> 89.52000000000001
when i'm going live which is normally 1

87.2 --> 91.68
p.m amsterdam time in the weekdays and 2

89.52 --> 94.079
p.m amsterdam time in the weekend and

91.68 --> 96.56
please also do support me through the

94.079 --> 98.79899999999999

96.56 --> 102.24000000000001
and the membership system join button

98.799 --> 102.24000000000001
that will be much appreciated

102.72 --> 107.92
so

103.52 --> 107.92
yeah the weather's looking different

108.96 --> 112.72
it's actually raining it just started

111.28 --> 115.759
though but

112.72 --> 118.479
it's been clouded and windy

115.759 --> 118.479
all morning

124.88 --> 129.84
i'm pretty sure it's only going to be

126.32 --> 129.84
temporary i hope

133.44 --> 139.28
because

134.959 --> 142.16
like the entire august so far has been

139.28 --> 144.0
just nice weather but your clouds nice

142.16 --> 146.16
water weather budget clouds then

144.0 --> 149.36
suddenly big rainstorm then

146.16 --> 151.44
suddenly clear skies again

149.36 --> 153.519
and nice weather the next day so

151.44 --> 156.959
hopefully

153.519 --> 159.04
that's gonna be today as well

156.959 --> 160.8
right

159.04 --> 163.04
anyway

160.8 --> 166.56
hello pj krishank

163.04 --> 166.56
first in chat good to see you

167.2 --> 170.95899999999997
slow mo moon buggy

169.76 --> 176.67999999999998
it is

170.959 --> 176.68
monday the 16th of august 2021

177.36 --> 181.59900000000002
we're gonna have a two hour show today

182.4 --> 185.4
oh

185.76 --> 188.879
hello clutch bear

190.8 --> 193.12
hmm

196.239 --> 199.239
right

199.92 --> 203.44
hey seeking star wars

205.2 --> 210.39999999999998
yeah the ad was chris hadfield yeah yeah

208.0 --> 213.519
man i've been seeing that ad

210.4 --> 215.76000000000002
pop up a lot this weekend

213.519 --> 218.31900000000002
almost every video where it did play an

215.76 --> 221.04
ad especially at the start of it

218.319 --> 223.28
he would pop up like

221.04 --> 227.319
must have happened at least six or seven

223.28 --> 227.319
times this weekend

228.56 --> 233.68
so i know what you mean

230.319 --> 233.67999999999998
he's making his move

234.799 --> 239.64000000000001
his ad move

236.64 --> 239.64
anyway

240.879 --> 244.0
a moon shadow

247.28 --> 255.04
right so yesterday

249.68 --> 257.28000000000003
man my show yesterday was really intense

255.04 --> 259.199
i'm surprised i didn't really watch it

257.28 --> 261.11999999999995
back

259.199 --> 264.24
maybe i just didn't need to

261.12 --> 267.88
i think i remember most of it

264.24 --> 267.88
hello rob h

269.04 --> 273.68
but yeah it was good to be back on

270.96 --> 273.68
youtube and

276.08 --> 280.56
yeah yesterday's show i thought it was

277.919 --> 283.56
really good and intense and lots of

280.56 --> 283.56
esoterics

284.479 --> 287.35999999999996
hey good servant

287.68 --> 291.12
right

289.36 --> 294.47900000000004
uh

291.12 --> 297.6
i also actually went on 24 7 discord

294.479 --> 299.84
again yesterday uh what time was that

297.6 --> 302.88
much later

299.84 --> 302.88
somewhere in the evening

305.759 --> 309.84000000000003
just talk kind of the same thing oh yeah

308.0 --> 311.68
we're talking about the globe of the

309.84 --> 315.59999999999997
heavens

311.68 --> 317.28000000000003
that was a subject and about how

315.6 --> 320.0
yeah

317.28 --> 321.28
how that works and how i i pretty much

320.0 --> 324.24
laid down

321.28 --> 325.67999999999995
it's worth repeating here

324.24 --> 327.68
i laid down

325.68 --> 329.919
like how

327.68 --> 332.08
the holographic nature of the globe of

329.919 --> 334.88
the heavens

332.08 --> 337.35999999999996
is like it's very confusing because its

334.88 --> 339.919
nature is completely different from any

337.36 --> 342.8
light we make here on earth

339.919 --> 344.24
with a candle or with electricity based

342.8 --> 346.8
devices

344.24 --> 350.32
or yeah

346.8 --> 352.16
so because the holographic nature

350.32 --> 353.36
like it's so different it's like a

352.16 --> 356.47900000000004
different

353.36 --> 360.0
mechanical universe almost like a

356.479 --> 361.44
totally different field what it is

360.0 --> 365.28
right the holographic love of the

361.44 --> 365.28
heavens and the physical earth

365.759 --> 370.24
everything on it and in it the matter

370.4 --> 377.039
and then i explained to them like how

374.319 --> 379.44
the baller cosmology

377.039 --> 383.68
uses that

379.44 --> 386.0
this contortion that complete difference

383.68 --> 388.24
that is probably on average a little

386.0 --> 390.24
difficult to understand for people right

388.24 --> 391.52
because holograms are like very

390.24 --> 394.479
confusing

391.52 --> 396.96
on an intuitive level level

394.479 --> 398.31899999999996
like unless you really get into it and

396.96 --> 400.479
you study it

398.319 --> 402.40000000000003
and then some of that confusion might

400.479 --> 403.59999999999997
drop away eventually

402.4 --> 407.75899999999996
but to a whole bunch of people it's

403.6 --> 410.0
confusing so what they did i think

407.759 --> 410.0
is

410.72 --> 413.36
not

411.52 --> 416.08
explain the true nature of the

413.36 --> 419.91900000000004
holographics of it but instead let the

416.08 --> 421.12
mind fuse it as if it is a whole

419.919 --> 423.12
right

421.12 --> 425.199
and then all that is really required is

423.12 --> 426.96
for you to imagine the earth is a ball

425.199 --> 429.52000000000004
underneath all that

426.96 --> 430.63899999999995
and because of the holographic nature of

429.52 --> 433.35999999999996
it

430.639 --> 435.199
and the actual discontortion of the

433.36 --> 437.28000000000003
senses because when you look at the

435.199 --> 439.52000000000004
stars for example

437.28 --> 441.52
it's something completely different from

439.52 --> 443.75899999999996
anything on earth

441.52 --> 444.88
and if you really on a very sensitive

443.759 --> 447.44
level

444.88 --> 449.759
like observe it and feel it out

447.44 --> 451.919
compare it to some sighting on earth you

449.759 --> 453.759
will feel that

451.919 --> 454.79999999999995
right but if you don't consciously know

453.759 --> 458.319
that

454.8 --> 460.639
then your mind can very easily just

458.319 --> 462.47900000000004
use the holographics to imagine an

460.639 --> 464.479
infinite universe

462.479 --> 467.52
and because of the holographic

464.479 --> 470.31899999999996
light effect i think that it just

467.52 --> 472.24
it helps extra right if you were like in

470.319 --> 474.56
a really big

472.24 --> 476.24
dome blacken out dome with

474.56 --> 478.8
lights

476.24 --> 480.879
on the ceilings

478.8 --> 482.879
to kind of simulate the same light

480.879 --> 484.96000000000004
pattern that wouldn't have the same

482.879 --> 486.96000000000004
effect because they would still be

484.96 --> 489.52
lights coming from a euclidean position

486.96 --> 491.599
it wouldn't have that holographic effect

489.52 --> 495.52
and then you wouldn't sink into that

491.599 --> 497.759
imagination of the endless universe

495.52 --> 497.75899999999996
right

498.72 --> 502.16
so

499.84 --> 503.19899999999996
it's kind of resting on an aberration

502.16 --> 505.68
within

503.199 --> 507.44
the psychological confrontation of the

505.68 --> 512.16
discontortion

507.44 --> 512.16
of the celestial versus the terrestrial

514.08 --> 519.039
that might actually make a halfway

515.919 --> 521.76
decent title i think

519.039 --> 523.76
it's just but it would be pretty long

521.76 --> 525.36
anyway

523.76 --> 527.36
right

525.36 --> 529.36
so i thought that was worth mentioning

527.36 --> 531.2
again

529.36 --> 533.04
and i yeah i

531.2 --> 535.9200000000001
rolled that out

533.04 --> 538.56
at the 24 7 discord and it was

535.92 --> 538.56
appreciated

540.32 --> 545.0400000000001
it is funny though that when i roll it

542.08 --> 545.0400000000001
out people are like

546.08 --> 549.839
okay

547.519 --> 552.0
like i can feel like they suddenly have

549.839 --> 554.24
to think about it

552.0 --> 556.56
it's so funny people just automatically

554.24 --> 558.5600000000001
roll back and forth and they come in and

556.56 --> 563.5189999999999
lay down something pretty complex and

558.56 --> 565.279
you i can literally feel in like

563.519 --> 568.24
they have to think about it because it

565.279 --> 570.72
takes people they did get like a bit

568.24 --> 570.72
silent

570.959 --> 574.7199999999999
and then you have the familiar effect

572.72 --> 577.279
which i have on this show too i guess

574.72 --> 579.0400000000001
even though i'm the only speaker like i

577.279 --> 580.48
lay the something down and then i'm just

579.04 --> 582.0
like hey

580.48 --> 584.26
where did everybody go why didn't

582.0 --> 588.59
anybody comment for like five minutes

584.26 --> 588.59
[Laughter]

589.76 --> 593.04
i guess it's the same effect

595.6 --> 600.0
i think it it

597.2 --> 602.88
it probably does on average take a bit

600.0 --> 604.56
of concentration to really

602.88 --> 605.92
follow me in my terrain of thinking

604.56 --> 608.16
sometimes

605.92 --> 608.16
right

609.279 --> 613.12
okay hello return to normal

614.72 --> 616.9590000000001
what

617.2 --> 623.6
gonna be 2k soon what what oh right the

620.8 --> 627.56
subscribers yeah

623.6 --> 627.5600000000001
yeah let's see where it is

636.0 --> 641.24
yeah

638.24 --> 641.24
1988

644.48 --> 648.0
right

645.76 --> 651.48
i wonder how long it'll take

648.0 --> 651.48
hey drunkenbullet411

651.6 --> 656.9590000000001
yep i'm back on youtube

654.72 --> 659.2
i hope you realized

656.959 --> 661.8389999999999
i was live on the live

659.2 --> 661.839
all week

667.519 --> 671.279
you can still watch some of those

669.44 --> 673.6
episodes back

671.279 --> 675.76
the the last few

673.6 --> 679.2
on the alive

675.76 --> 682.24
if you want to watch a show

679.2 --> 684.6400000000001
another one on top of this

682.24 --> 684.64
anyway

687.36 --> 690.88
oh yeah hello cleary

691.76 --> 696.56
so yeah

694.16 --> 699.36
monday

696.56 --> 699.3599999999999
bit dreary

699.519 --> 704.8
that does typically set the tone

702.64 --> 706.0
but

704.8 --> 708.8
yeah i'm still

706.0 --> 708.8
going strong

710.639 --> 714.72
what's this d life you speak that's

712.639 --> 718.639
another streaming platform it's been out

714.72 --> 718.639
for years you didn't know that

721.36 --> 724.399
i will link you up

725.04 --> 730.519
right i still got two replays going on

727.519 --> 730.519
there

741.2 --> 744.2
um

750.32 --> 753.32
hey

759.6 --> 762.0
all right

765.92 --> 768.92
cheers

781.12 --> 786.32
right so something that kind of stood

782.8 --> 788.24
out this weekend also

786.32 --> 790.1600000000001
even yesterday but yesterday was just a

788.24 --> 792.32
really themed show i didn't

790.16 --> 794.7199999999999
want to get into it but apparently this

792.32 --> 796.8000000000001
is the whole thing like the taliban has

794.72 --> 800.12
taken a

796.8 --> 800.12
back afghanistan

800.16 --> 803.2199999999999
[Music]

804.88 --> 808.639
it's just very telling

809.279 --> 814.88
like the response of this in media world

811.839 --> 815.9200000000001
like it really reveals where everybody

814.88 --> 818.8
is at

815.92 --> 821.199
to me and to own benjamin is especially

818.8 --> 822.8
picked up on this he did like special

821.199 --> 825.3599999999999
recordings even

822.8 --> 828.56
this weekend

825.36 --> 830.5600000000001
that i watched through the youtube

828.56 --> 832.3199999999999
channel

830.56 --> 833.8389999999999
because he didn't upload that on bit

832.32 --> 836.0790000000001
shoot

833.839 --> 837.2790000000001
i don't know why

836.079 --> 838.2399999999999
but

837.279 --> 840.72
yeah i

838.24 --> 842.8
i got it in my recommended list on my

840.72 --> 846.72
youtube channel

842.8 --> 846.7199999999999
and he talks about that elaborately

847.04 --> 853.76
but yeah what what i find very telling

850.56 --> 855.1199999999999
especially like from the alex jones side

853.76 --> 857.199
is that

855.12 --> 859.92
i really get the feeling like he is

857.199 --> 859.92
conflicted

860.0 --> 864.48
in his entire approach because on the

861.76 --> 867.279
one hand he was kind of like tied into

864.48 --> 868.839
this narrative of like oh islam

867.279 --> 872.0
is

868.839 --> 874.8800000000001
evil then again he does also want to

872.0 --> 877.839
give recognition for just the crazyness

874.88 --> 877.8389999999999
of trying to

878.399 --> 884.24
take control of afghanistan and the

880.88 --> 886.72
soviets preceded that soviet russia in

884.24 --> 887.839
the 80s was it

886.72 --> 888.9590000000001
and

887.839 --> 890.72
yeah just

888.959 --> 892.4799999999999
so he but

890.72 --> 894.72
there's still

892.48 --> 896.0
because he's tied to it there's still

894.72 --> 899.1990000000001
sources

896.0 --> 900.639
that is that are being linked to

899.199 --> 902.24
his articles

900.639 --> 904.16
where i get the feeling like they're

902.24 --> 905.92
really trying to

904.16 --> 908.16
hype it up

905.92 --> 910.24
like they want to create this apparent

908.16 --> 913.4399999999999
evacuation panic

910.24 --> 915.92
or whatever but is it really that bad it

913.44 --> 917.9200000000001
see to me it seems like a lot of it is

915.92 --> 920.399
just

917.92 --> 925.7199999999999
they're trying to create a hype

920.399 --> 925.72
because it's not really that dramatic

929.279 --> 932.16
it really isn't

935.04 --> 939.199
from what i've seen it's but yeah i

937.199 --> 940.56
can't be sure though it's just

939.199 --> 942.959
yeah

940.56 --> 945.1199999999999
when they they tried to link on purpose

942.959 --> 947.3599999999999
this is what infowars does a lot of the

945.12 --> 948.5600000000001
time right you got to pay attention to

947.36 --> 950.48
this

948.56 --> 953.04
in the sense that you gotta

950.48 --> 954.72
not easily just roll right with it

953.04 --> 957.12
whatever they're suggesting because they

954.72 --> 958.88
do like to sort of manipulate the

957.12 --> 961.04
feelings of people

958.88 --> 964.0
in a certain just to pull them in a

961.04 --> 964.0
certain perspective

964.48 --> 973.04
especially because of before mentioned

966.8 --> 973.04
reasons the islam agenda for america

975.12 --> 978.399
but it just seemed like they were

977.36 --> 980.48
all these

978.399 --> 982.16
little video snippets

980.48 --> 984.32
like oh no they're fleeing they're

982.16 --> 985.92
fleeing but like nobody i don't see

984.32 --> 989.759
anybody getting killed

985.92 --> 989.759
don't even see wounded people

990.079 --> 993.8389999999999
or anything

992.48 --> 996.0
so

993.839 --> 997.6
was it all really that dramatic or was

996.0 --> 1000.8
it kind of a pretty peaceful

997.6 --> 1000.8000000000001
transitioning way

1004.639 --> 1008.399
it's hard to tell

1006.56 --> 1012.2399999999999
for me right now

1008.399 --> 1014.32
but yeah i i had to make like a minor

1012.24 --> 1016.0790000000001
comment about it at least like i'm

1014.32 --> 1018.9590000000001
paying attention here i'm i'm really

1016.079 --> 1018.959
trying to figure out

1020.0 --> 1024.72
like what is real and what is what they

1022.72 --> 1027.76
want you to believe about it

1024.72 --> 1027.76
the different parties

1027.839 --> 1033.36
because these in this period of time

1030.559 --> 1033.36
in this age

1033.839 --> 1040.079
post 2020

1036.88 --> 1044.0
it's all become very convoluted what

1040.079 --> 1044.0
they want you to believe and they will

1044.16 --> 1051.6000000000001
easily make not something out of nothing

1048.559 --> 1052.96
and will be very

1051.6 --> 1058.08
good

1052.96 --> 1060.32
at it like they know movie making now

1058.08 --> 1061.9189999999999
like they really get what makes good

1060.32 --> 1067.12
movies

1061.919 --> 1070.3200000000002
and they just try to format it like that

1067.12 --> 1073.6789999999999
put it in a certain emotional context

1070.32 --> 1074.8799999999999
suggest some things some fears usually

1073.679 --> 1076.88
involved

1074.88 --> 1079.2
and then they create that

1076.88 --> 1083.0390000000002
story with it and then they use real

1079.2 --> 1083.039
material real footage and all that

1084.32 --> 1089.039
but they'll still just create this thing

1087.12 --> 1090.7199999999998
here

1089.039 --> 1094.08
where it just

1090.72 --> 1096.16
draws you in a very specific view on the

1094.08 --> 1098.96
situation and you

1096.16 --> 1101.44
it discourages you from just looking at

1098.96 --> 1104.24
the raw data

1101.44 --> 1106.24
through the distractions of the feelings

1104.24 --> 1109.679
and the context

1106.24 --> 1112.4
with which it is brought to you anyway

1109.679 --> 1112.4
that's happening

1118.4 --> 1122.2800000000002
what oh [ __ ]

1123.28 --> 1126.799
yes classical homeopath

1130.88 --> 1135.2
now the taliban

1133.679 --> 1136.4
like

1135.2 --> 1137.76
on average

1136.4 --> 1140.0
i think

1137.76 --> 1142.08
like their entire attitude is just

1140.0 --> 1143.679
no-nonsense right

1142.08 --> 1146.32
that's real they're they're really

1143.679 --> 1149.44
militant at that but they're just

1146.32 --> 1150.799
no-nonsense muslims like that

1149.44 --> 1152.48
like

1150.799 --> 1156.4
don't mess with us

1152.48 --> 1156.4
and like every every single one of them

1160.48 --> 1166.32
it's funny by the way because there is

1162.32 --> 1169.52
this movie called rambo 3

1166.32 --> 1173.12
that completely shows that

1169.52 --> 1175.12
in a really serious way

1173.12 --> 1177.52
and then yeah

1175.12 --> 1179.28
like that movie was very bizarre

1177.52 --> 1181.84
because of

1179.28 --> 1184.08
how it all turned out afterward

1181.84 --> 1186.3999999999999
it's i also thought it was interesting

1184.08 --> 1186.3999999999999
because

1186.88 --> 1191.0390000000002
movie character rambo

1189.12 --> 1193.9189999999999
i do get the feeling like

1191.039 --> 1194.799
sylvester stallone

1193.919 --> 1197.039
is

1194.799 --> 1197.9189999999999
it's his character like that's a part of

1197.039 --> 1200.559
him

1197.919 --> 1202.5590000000002
it's a really interesting character

1200.559 --> 1204.3999999999999
i get the feeling like

1202.559 --> 1205.76
in the follow-up movies that were made

1204.4 --> 1208.3200000000002
much later

1205.76 --> 1208.32
rambo

1208.4 --> 1212.159
did take note

1210.32 --> 1214.24
like he fought

1212.159 --> 1216.0
with the taliban

1214.24 --> 1218.08
in rambo three

1216.0 --> 1220.64
and then

1218.08 --> 1222.72
right he was there with the soviets

1220.64 --> 1223.919
doing all that [ __ ] of course it was a

1222.72 --> 1226.159
movie

1223.919 --> 1226.159
right

1226.88 --> 1232.3200000000002
but he was there

1229.12 --> 1234.6399999999999
and then in the real world

1232.32 --> 1236.799
like the whole [ __ ] happened with 911

1234.64 --> 1238.24
and everything and he knows he knows it

1236.799 --> 1241.039
was [ __ ]

1238.24 --> 1241.84
he carries even more weight than before

1241.039 --> 1243.679
right

1241.84 --> 1247.9599999999998
unspoken

1243.679 --> 1247.96
and that stood out to me like

1248.64 --> 1254.5590000000002
i think that the rambo character is like

1251.12 --> 1257.84
really realistic in certain ways

1254.559 --> 1260.8799999999999
like a very deep and rich character that

1257.84 --> 1263.039
is really supposed to be a reflection

1260.88 --> 1265.5200000000002
from the real world and then

1263.039 --> 1267.919
movie [ __ ] happens of course it's

1265.52 --> 1269.44
action movie style

1267.919 --> 1271.1200000000001
and in the real world it doesn't really

1269.44 --> 1272.559
happen like that

1271.12 --> 1276.4799999999998
but like the

1272.559 --> 1279.28
angle to things and wars and situations

1276.48 --> 1281.84
all that is taken very serious from the

1279.28 --> 1283.76
world and the character remembers it and

1281.84 --> 1286.48
is punished by it and carries more

1283.76 --> 1289.2
weight as he grows older

1286.48 --> 1291.039
and that yeah anyway

1289.2 --> 1292.0800000000002
i don't know how i ended up with that

1291.039 --> 1294.96
but

1292.08 --> 1297.1999999999998
oh yeah the taliban

1294.96 --> 1297.2
right

1301.12 --> 1307.9189999999999
i wonder too if

1305.2 --> 1312.24
if it's like a little detail but

1307.919 --> 1314.72
rambo 3 was like in july

1312.24 --> 1316.08
recommended by netflix it was put to the

1314.72 --> 1317.679
front of the line

1316.08 --> 1320.32
rambo 3

1317.679 --> 1321.76
not yeah well remo the rambo movies have

1320.32 --> 1324.32
been in there for a while but it was

1321.76 --> 1326.4
like specifically fronted forward and i

1324.32 --> 1328.08
wonder if it's because everybody was

1326.4 --> 1330.159
watching it to study like hey the

1328.08 --> 1332.6399999999999
taliban they are like taking back

1330.159 --> 1335.0390000000002
afghanistan what is that and then you

1332.64 --> 1336.88
watch rambo 3 because it has taliban in

1335.039 --> 1338.8799999999999
them it's like one of the few movies

1336.88 --> 1340.96
where it's actually halfway try to

1338.88 --> 1343.2
respect the culture

1340.96 --> 1344.72
right

1343.2 --> 1346.48
and

1344.72 --> 1348.32
yeah it's just

1346.48 --> 1350.08
realizing that afterwards it's really

1348.32 --> 1352.32
interesting because i had no idea about

1350.08 --> 1354.8799999999999
this i i didn't really pay too close

1352.32 --> 1354.8799999999999
attention

1357.28 --> 1361.6
i do now

1358.88 --> 1364.159
now i've re i realized like okay this is

1361.6 --> 1364.1589999999999
all happened

1367.76 --> 1370.76
anyway

1408.24 --> 1411.44
oh

1409.36 --> 1413.1999999999998
look at moon shadow they're squirting

1411.44 --> 1415.2
yeah

1413.2 --> 1419.52
but

1415.2 --> 1419.52
who do they do that to and why

1421.76 --> 1425.799
how's the crime in afghanistan

1443.2 --> 1446.88
hey moon shadow

1444.88 --> 1447.919
why don't you address me yeah why don't

1446.88 --> 1451.5200000000002
you leave

1447.919 --> 1453.279
my chat alone i brought this subject up

1451.52 --> 1456.0
you can address me about it yeah you're

1453.279 --> 1459.12
not gonna harass people in my chat

1456.0 --> 1461.2
with that type of

1459.12 --> 1464.36
peer pressure [ __ ]

1461.2 --> 1464.3600000000001
all right

1483.2 --> 1487.76
right so moon shadow let me

1485.6 --> 1490.0
let me lay down something for you all

1487.76 --> 1490.0
right

1490.08 --> 1492.799
what the hell

1493.679 --> 1496.96
okay

1494.64 --> 1500.24
let me let me lay down something for you

1496.96 --> 1503.24
moon shadow first off say my name say my

1500.24 --> 1503.24
name

1516.32 --> 1521.36
i i want to just lay down something

1518.24 --> 1523.6
that's going to be very very patientful

1521.36 --> 1526.32
to face for

1523.6 --> 1526.32
everyone

1527.2 --> 1531.679
right

1528.64 --> 1531.679
so what's worse

1534.4 --> 1538.4
militant

1536.4 --> 1540.3200000000002
hardcore muslims

1538.4 --> 1541.679
stoning women

1540.32 --> 1543.6789999999999
because

1541.679 --> 1544.64
they didn't obey

1543.679 --> 1546.64
right

1544.64 --> 1548.0
that's the reason usually why that [ __ ]

1546.64 --> 1549.679
happens

1548.0 --> 1552.159
it's not like

1549.679 --> 1554.0
like they like they are defiant against

1552.159 --> 1556.0
the rules right they're sick of it they

1554.0 --> 1558.24
have a woman

1556.0 --> 1560.32
breakout situation

1558.24 --> 1563.1200000000001
yeah and unfortunately that that is part

1560.32 --> 1565.12
of the design it happens it's tragic

1563.12 --> 1566.799
right so what is more tragic a woman

1565.12 --> 1568.32
getting stoned to death

1566.799 --> 1571.279
because she just

1568.32 --> 1574.0
got possessed this woman sometimes do

1571.279 --> 1576.799
and then was destroyed right it

1574.0 --> 1579.6
really harsh what's worse that

1576.799 --> 1582.48
or little three-year-olds or

1579.6 --> 1582.48
five-year-olds

1583.52 --> 1588.4
being signed up for hormone therapy and

1586.4 --> 1590.72
surgery

1588.4 --> 1594.24
because

1590.72 --> 1596.64
this giant dark spell from above on top

1594.24 --> 1599.679
of the entire family is telling them

1596.64 --> 1601.919
like no no it's the opposite they're not

1599.679 --> 1604.3200000000002
they can be the opposite sex so what is

1601.919 --> 1604.3200000000002
worse

1605.679 --> 1611.52
right the mental and physical defiling

1608.96 --> 1614.64
of little children or the stoning to

1611.52 --> 1616.48
death of women for disobeying

1614.64 --> 1619.3600000000001
huh

1616.48 --> 1619.3600000000001
think about that

1619.919 --> 1624.96
before you start choosing a side and

1622.72 --> 1630.2
just like

1624.96 --> 1630.2
lay down every every ugly part

1640.08 --> 1644.0
i have very sexist ideas

1642.88 --> 1647.1200000000001
oh

1644.0 --> 1647.12
somebody got triggered

1649.279 --> 1655.039
yep but seeking star wars that's

1652.399 --> 1656.6399999999999
kind of like how they see it

1655.039 --> 1658.96
and

1656.64 --> 1658.96
yeah

1659.039 --> 1662.48
there's something to it it's just spirit

1661.039 --> 1664.559
mechanics right

1662.48 --> 1666.24
and that can be perceived as getting

1664.559 --> 1669.039
possessed like

1666.24 --> 1671.279
dude i've had i've had relationships

1669.039 --> 1673.919
with women women

1671.279 --> 1675.679
and like when i did like the wrong thing

1673.919 --> 1678.48
at the wrong time

1675.679 --> 1680.24
they could be like really scary

1678.48 --> 1682.48
out of nowhere

1680.24 --> 1683.18
like they were possessed and then like

1682.48 --> 1687.52
yeah

1683.18 --> 1690.3200000000002
[Laughter]

1687.52 --> 1692.32
now maybe i have some of these traits

1690.32 --> 1693.76
myself at times

1692.32 --> 1697.12
right i'm not

1693.76 --> 1699.76
like saying oh my god that justifies

1697.12 --> 1702.559
that it happens right i'm just laying

1699.76 --> 1705.6
this down to compare it to another

1702.559 --> 1707.2
situation that absolutely under any

1705.6 --> 1708.84
circumstances

1707.2 --> 1711.52
like that would never happen in

1708.84 --> 1714.48
afghanistan but it does happen in europe

1711.52 --> 1714.48
and in america

1715.679 --> 1720.5590000000002
and that is literally the surgical and

1718.559 --> 1724.799
mental defiling

1720.559 --> 1728.44
of very little children

1724.799 --> 1728.44
so what is worse

1739.2 --> 1744.3990000000001
yeah come on you are triggered

1742.32 --> 1746.0
you're very triggered over me calling it

1744.399 --> 1748.799
possessed

1746.0 --> 1751.279
right i was saying possessed in the

1748.799 --> 1754.32
context of their

1751.279 --> 1757.44
culture of how they see it how why like

1754.32 --> 1760.48
they have a reason to do that okay

1757.44 --> 1762.159
when you see like them doing brutalizing

1760.48 --> 1765.6
people like that

1762.159 --> 1767.8400000000001
they have a reason for doing that they

1765.6 --> 1769.6789999999999
don't just like oh it's an animal

1767.84 --> 1771.76
impulse and suddenly we have to

1769.679 --> 1774.88
slaughter right that's not how that

1771.76 --> 1776.48
works there's a logical consistency to

1774.88 --> 1778.96
how they do that

1776.48 --> 1780.799
you don't have to like it it is terrible

1778.96 --> 1782.96
it is terrifying

1780.799 --> 1784.799
right

1782.96 --> 1787.44
it is brutal

1784.799 --> 1789.9189999999999
i'm not denying that right i never said

1787.44 --> 1792.919
oh that's a good thing no i never said

1789.919 --> 1792.919
that

1794.08 --> 1801.1999999999998
right so when i said possessed

1796.88 --> 1801.2
that's how they see that

1802.0 --> 1806.799
and then they have a certain response to

1804.08 --> 1807.6789999999999
that that is advice to them by their

1806.799 --> 1810.1589999999999
book

1807.679 --> 1812.64
right by the other prophet

1810.159 --> 1812.64
and that's

1814.159 --> 1818.24
it's like spiritual war tactics right

1816.399 --> 1821.6
that's the difference

1818.24 --> 1824.72
muslims just don't take [ __ ] like ever

1821.6 --> 1827.36
like that the really hardcore ones

1824.72 --> 1829.6000000000001
it's like as jesus was the

1827.36 --> 1833.6
prophet of peace

1829.6 --> 1837.7199999999998
in a way islam is a prophet of war

1833.6 --> 1837.7199999999998
but a spiritual war

1837.76 --> 1842.24
as

1839.52 --> 1843.76
christ a spiritual peace

1842.24 --> 1846.3990000000001
through that right it's another

1843.76 --> 1846.399
frequency

1847.279 --> 1853.919
it's another way of going about

1850.88 --> 1856.5590000000002
and it does make victims everything

1853.919 --> 1859.039
makes makes victims one way or another

1856.559 --> 1860.08
i just wanted to compare it just lay it

1859.039 --> 1862.24
out

1860.08 --> 1864.0
look at what happens in western society

1862.24 --> 1865.919
and then compare it to like one of these

1864.0 --> 1868.399
terrible things that happened

1865.919 --> 1868.3990000000001
over there

1870.799 --> 1873.76
with the taliban

1875.44 --> 1880.0
and then think again before you judge

1877.76 --> 1880.0
them

1886.48 --> 1890.96
oh really cps

1888.64 --> 1896.3990000000001
really

1890.96 --> 1899.519
oh cps thinks he knows it oh yeah

1896.399 --> 1901.4399999999998
oh hormone therapy isn't death by

1899.519 --> 1904.159
agonizing torture oh

1901.44 --> 1908.64
so really no but it's not just hormone

1904.159 --> 1911.3600000000001
therapy right surgery

1908.64 --> 1912.159
and also the programming on top of all

1911.36 --> 1913.12
that

1912.159 --> 1917.2
yeah

1913.12 --> 1917.1999999999998
so you know what happens with a lot of

1917.84 --> 1922.399
yeah

1919.519 --> 1925.1200000000001
transsexuals that have been surgically

1922.399 --> 1925.12
adapted

1926.0 --> 1931.44
they

1927.6 --> 1934.48
snap out of it at some point and then

1931.44 --> 1936.64
yeah it turns out that

1934.48 --> 1938.559
there is actually a much higher level of

1936.64 --> 1941.2
suicide

1938.559 --> 1942.96
at with those people when they basically

1941.2 --> 1945.6000000000001
realize what has happened

1942.96 --> 1949.039
and also like who did that to you right

1945.6 --> 1951.279
because you loved everybody

1949.039 --> 1953.84
you just wanted to be free and you

1951.279 --> 1955.6
thought everything was okay

1953.84 --> 1957.6789999999999
and your parents were like yeah of

1955.6 --> 1959.84
course you could do that

1957.679 --> 1961.679
but they were responsible

1959.84 --> 1964.24
and when you start to realize that then

1961.679 --> 1966.48
you realize like how messed up it all is

1964.24 --> 1969.519
and that's a horrific

1966.48 --> 1971.44
now that that is spiritual torture and a

1969.519 --> 1973.679
lot of those people

1971.44 --> 1974.96
kill themselves

1973.679 --> 1977.679
yeah

1974.96 --> 1980.679
so what is more agonizing who are you to

1977.679 --> 1980.679
judge

1995.12 --> 1997.36
right

2000.96 --> 2007.6000000000001
yes it's all very

2003.279 --> 2007.6
very tough very confronting i know

2008.48 --> 2014.559
i didn't mean to really trigger all of

2010.96 --> 2016.96
you but i think it just needs to be said

2014.559 --> 2020.24
like let's get honest of this full

2016.96 --> 2020.24
spectrum consequence

2021.679 --> 2025.72
of the societal structures

2035.84 --> 2042.039
yeah jason brown

2038.32 --> 2042.039
never all that wealth

2046.72 --> 2050.879
right but the difference though jason

2048.639 --> 2053.839
brown is that when you are officially

2050.879 --> 2055.679
old enough to decide such things

2053.839 --> 2058.0789999999997
you thought about it

2055.679 --> 2061.04
you are

2058.079 --> 2063.119
at least physically grown enough to kind

2061.04 --> 2065.44
of figure out like even what you are

2063.119 --> 2068.3990000000003
what your shape is naturally

2065.44 --> 2071.52
if you then want to do it well it's your

2068.399 --> 2074.159
responsibility and then if you regret it

2071.52 --> 2075.359
afterward you have nobody to blame but

2074.159 --> 2077.679
yourself

2075.359 --> 2080.96
you see

2077.679 --> 2080.96
that's honest freedom

2081.679 --> 2087.599
i don't advise to do that but

2084.32 --> 2090.2400000000002
yeah that's if you made that decision as

2087.599 --> 2091.679
an adult that it's your decision to make

2090.24 --> 2094.399
and if you regret it then you have

2091.679 --> 2096.079
nobody to blame for it but yourself

2094.399 --> 2098.0
right

2096.079 --> 2100.88
that's the difference now if you're a

2098.0 --> 2100.88
very little kid

2100.96 --> 2106.96
you don't have that luxury afterward

2104.8 --> 2109.2000000000003
when you snap out of it

2106.96 --> 2109.2
no

2109.92 --> 2117.28
you could almost compare it to being

2114.16 --> 2119.839
a child soldier sounds very bizarre to

2117.28 --> 2122.88
compare it like that right but a child

2119.839 --> 2124.4
soldier often just like oh i'm called to

2122.88 --> 2126.1600000000003
do this i want

2124.4 --> 2127.2000000000003
basic

2126.16 --> 2129.2
early

2127.2 --> 2131.2
defense instincts and all that they want

2129.2 --> 2133.2
to be men or whatever yeah and they'll

2131.2 --> 2135.839
do that right but then they go through

2133.2 --> 2137.4399999999996
horrific [ __ ] they never really have a

2135.839 --> 2139.44
youth and then afterward when they're

2137.44 --> 2141.839
older they're like realized like holy

2139.44 --> 2145.2000000000003
[ __ ] how messed up

2141.839 --> 2146.24
like i'm messed up now right

2145.2 --> 2148.16
well

2146.24 --> 2150.3999999999996
if you're a little kid

2148.16 --> 2153.04
and you're all like your parents are all

2150.4 --> 2157.28
super pro trans and you they basically

2153.04 --> 2157.2799999999997
just force you to become a trans child

2157.359 --> 2162.0
with surgery and all

2159.599 --> 2164.8
you could compare that it's very

2162.0 --> 2167.52
different setting though

2164.8 --> 2169.8390000000004
but if then afterward you grow up and

2167.52 --> 2171.359
you realize what has happened how much

2169.839 --> 2173.52
different is that

2171.359 --> 2175.2799999999997
from the life of a child soldier even

2173.52 --> 2177.599
though they were probably much more

2175.28 --> 2179.599
traumatic bloody and it's a different

2177.599 --> 2181.839
type of trauma

2179.599 --> 2181.839
see

2181.92 --> 2185.8
how different is it

2186.8 --> 2190.48
again don't judge

2190.72 --> 2195.2
until you look at what we got

2197.599 --> 2203.04
yes exactly

2200.96 --> 2203.92
now trans people who regret it they feel

2203.04 --> 2206.16
tricked

2203.92 --> 2206.16
right

2206.72 --> 2210.3199999999997
but if it happened during their

2208.96 --> 2213.119
childhood

2210.32 --> 2215.44
then they were tricked

2213.119 --> 2217.52
you see

2215.44 --> 2219.76
if you do it as an adult you tricked

2217.52 --> 2223.72
yourself you're responsible for yourself

2219.76 --> 2223.7200000000003
as an adult right

2228.16 --> 2234.7999999999997
yeah those child trans people if they

2231.2 --> 2237.839
regret it as an adult then

2234.8 --> 2240.7200000000003
yeah they have a po it's like yes the

2237.839 --> 2243.2
society allowed that to happen

2240.72 --> 2245.5989999999997
they did that to me this is probably

2243.2 --> 2248.72
something that haunts some people i'm

2245.599 --> 2248.7200000000003
very sorry for you

2254.32 --> 2258.48
i bet i'm gonna trigger a whole bunch of

2256.64 --> 2261.7599999999998
people out there i am sorry man but

2258.48 --> 2264.2400000000002
that's the way it is

2261.76 --> 2266.6400000000003
right i'm not trying to take away your

2264.24 --> 2266.64
freedom

2267.92 --> 2272.48
i'm just trying to lay out the natural

2269.92 --> 2273.599
consequences of those systems that are

2272.48 --> 2276.4
in place

2273.599 --> 2280.599
these supposed freedoms

2276.4 --> 2280.599
to do things to children

2285.839 --> 2289.68
right

2286.88 --> 2292.1600000000003
when children don't know

2289.68 --> 2294.24
what you're supposed they look up to

2292.16 --> 2296.0
their parents for that

2294.24 --> 2297.52
or

2296.0 --> 2300.16
well the state

2297.52 --> 2301.839
or the tv screen or whatever they will

2300.16 --> 2303.68
end up looking up to

2301.839 --> 2304.96
and that's up to the parents to make

2303.68 --> 2310.56
sure they don't

2304.96 --> 2310.56
get tricked by wizardry by crazy tv

2310.839 --> 2316.0789999999997
personalities oh no

2313.359 --> 2318.3199999999997
right or yeah it's the responsibility of

2316.079 --> 2321.28
the parents

2318.32 --> 2325.2000000000003
the child cannot be held accountable for

2321.28 --> 2326.88
that they're not fully grown they need

2325.2 --> 2328.48
the protection

2326.88 --> 2329.92
and then when they're adult

2328.48 --> 2332.32
not all of them

2329.92 --> 2334.56
really grow up that much but then

2332.32 --> 2337.04
officially like they they at least get

2334.56 --> 2341.0
to be told like yeah you are responsible

2337.04 --> 2341.0
for yourself so they can

2342.0 --> 2344.24
at least

2343.28 --> 2346.88
just

2344.24 --> 2346.8799999999997
attempt it

2347.44 --> 2350.44
right

2354.8 --> 2361.2000000000003
yeah well kevin barbato yeah that's very

2358.72 --> 2363.68
dramatic way of saying it they become a

2361.2 --> 2366.48
john wick well yeah yeah that

2363.68 --> 2369.72
sort of is possible it'll probably feel

2366.48 --> 2369.72
like that

2371.359 --> 2376.48
like it's gonna mess them up like i

2374.32 --> 2379.3590000000004
it's not uneasy to imagine that some

2376.48 --> 2380.839
would like go really into like okay i'm

2379.359 --> 2385.68
going to

2380.839 --> 2389.04
be like they might turn into like

2385.68 --> 2391.7599999999998
sort of an in-cell thing

2389.04 --> 2393.7599999999998
right in cells a lot of them also have

2391.76 --> 2395.6800000000003
that sensation like i'm being raped by

2393.76 --> 2399.119
society

2395.68 --> 2401.5989999999997
and then they build they start to

2399.119 --> 2404.0
drown in vengeance fantasies and all

2401.599 --> 2406.4
that [ __ ] well that might happen to

2404.0 --> 2406.4
these

2407.04 --> 2409.68
people

2408.72 --> 2410.48
posts

2409.68 --> 2414.8799999999997
yeah

2410.48 --> 2417.44
trans child post trans child people

2414.88 --> 2419.44
might go through similar

2417.44 --> 2422.319
experiences just

2419.44 --> 2424.48
a bit of a warning

2422.319 --> 2426.88
for the future there right it's not a

2424.48 --> 2430.079
guarantee right a lot of them

2426.88 --> 2430.079
do actually just

2430.4 --> 2435.92
grow so much into their role

2434.24 --> 2438.56
that they don't

2435.92 --> 2440.16
regret it afterward but they do realize

2438.56 --> 2442.0789999999997
like that there might be something wrong

2440.16 --> 2444.48
with it and that's fascinating because

2442.079 --> 2446.1600000000003
there are actually trans people out

2444.48 --> 2447.839
there that have already seen

2446.16 --> 2450.0
that do actually

2447.839 --> 2451.68
promote the same point as i'm doing

2450.0 --> 2454.72
right now like don't do this to children

2451.68 --> 2456.0
this is bad but leave it to the adults

2454.72 --> 2459.1189999999997
right

2456.0 --> 2462.48
children don't yeah

2459.119 --> 2464.96
they don't know what they do yet

2462.48 --> 2467.44
they can't be made responsible for such

2464.96 --> 2469.92
a thing

2467.44 --> 2472.16
because those trans people are just

2469.92 --> 2474.7200000000003
really into that

2472.16 --> 2476.96
they're okay with it but they do realize

2474.72 --> 2479.4399999999996
what's real right that's isn't that the

2476.96 --> 2481.28
most important thing of all

2479.44 --> 2483.599
of any freedom is that you keep

2481.28 --> 2484.8
realizing what is real

2483.599 --> 2487.76
that you

2484.8 --> 2490.8
accept the consequences of your choices

2487.76 --> 2490.8
within your freedom

2493.599 --> 2498.48
and i appreciate that

2496.16 --> 2498.48
anyway

2504.4 --> 2509.44
blair white

2505.92 --> 2512.44
i don't know who that is kevin barbato

2509.44 --> 2512.44
anyway

2531.599 --> 2534.839
all right so before you

2533.29 --> 2538.48
[Music]

2534.839 --> 2541.599
as extreme leftist parents or whatever

2538.48 --> 2543.92
and you're all so into it right before

2541.599 --> 2546.6400000000003
you actually consider like oh i want to

2543.92 --> 2548.96
be trendy i want to have a trans kid to

2546.64 --> 2551.2
just realize that

2548.96 --> 2554.0
if you actually do that you might be

2551.2 --> 2555.52
creating a future incel that will hate

2554.0 --> 2558.16
your guts

2555.52 --> 2559.839
like nothing you've ever seen

2558.16 --> 2562.24
just realize that

2559.839 --> 2565.48
no garrett like it might happen

2562.24 --> 2565.4799999999996
you cannot

2565.839 --> 2569.04
do it

2567.52 --> 2570.48
in a way that would guarantee it

2569.04 --> 2573.44
wouldn't

2570.48 --> 2575.76
so be very

2573.44 --> 2579.04
those people you never think about such

2575.76 --> 2584.0400000000004
things that's the whole problem right

2579.04 --> 2584.04
and halfway sensible people do

2610.4 --> 2615.48
oh okay matthew

2612.48 --> 2615.48
what

2652.96 --> 2655.96
uh

2689.359 --> 2694.319
okay hey tony whitcomb

2692.64 --> 2696.48
right

2694.319 --> 2699.2
so yeah i didn't actually

2696.48 --> 2702.599
wanna want everybody to dwell on this

2699.2 --> 2702.5989999999997
for too much

2704.64 --> 2710.24
it pulls a lot of deep strings with a

2706.88 --> 2713.359
lot of people like both sides right i

2710.24 --> 2717.68
just thought it would be fair to put

2713.359 --> 2719.5989999999997
these things down next to one another

2717.68 --> 2722.3999999999996
like

2719.599 --> 2724.96
two huge

2722.4 --> 2727.04
aggravating problems for each other like

2724.96 --> 2729.28
two

2727.04 --> 2731.7599999999998
sides of a magnet

2729.28 --> 2734.4
like they seem polar opposite but they

2731.76 --> 2737.0400000000004
are kind of in the same intensity the

2734.4 --> 2739.44
same dilemma

2737.04 --> 2742.16
in ways right

2739.44 --> 2745.4
both things trigger the other side to

2742.16 --> 2745.3999999999996
the extreme

2746.96 --> 2753.359
so is one better than the other then is

2750.16 --> 2755.04
it really when you honestly weigh it out

2753.359 --> 2758.04
that is really the reason i brought it

2755.04 --> 2758.04
up

2788.96 --> 2791.96
hmm

2837.119 --> 2843.2400000000002
okay uh yeah that's a long enough pause

2840.24 --> 2843.24
there

2844.0 --> 2848.359
i was just looking some things up

2881.92 --> 2885.4
what the hell

2888.81 --> 2891.88
[Music]

2892.24 --> 2895.24
um

2927.119 --> 2931.28
was that a gobo ghostbusters joke you

2929.52 --> 2934.16
dropped on fed

2931.28 --> 2936.96
4d7 can you

2934.16 --> 2940.2799999999997
can you bring up what i said

2936.96 --> 2940.28
i don't remember

2967.52 --> 2973.04
oh the gatekeeper and keem of course duh

2971.04 --> 2974.8
yeah i don't even have to know where

2973.04 --> 2976.5589999999997
that is if yeah if i bring up the

2974.8 --> 2980.319
gatekeeper and the keymaster yeah of

2976.559 --> 2980.3190000000004
course it's from ghostbusters

2987.359 --> 2992.96
right but yeah movies like ghostbusters

2989.68 --> 2992.96
have a lot of good

2993.28 --> 2996.88
like spirit

2995.119 --> 2999.2000000000003
it's improvised it's like spirit

2996.88 --> 3001.359
mechanics in a way right they really try

2999.2 --> 3001.359
to

3001.76 --> 3005.6400000000003
ah it's just interesting

3016.8 --> 3020.88
also ghostbusters man what made that

3019.599 --> 3022.7200000000003
movie so

3020.88 --> 3024.8
unbelievable

3022.72 --> 3029.2799999999997
the freaking music

3024.8 --> 3029.28
and how diverse it is

3030.72 --> 3036.83
but i really love like the ghost mystery

3034.16 --> 3044.24
music with the big horns

3036.83 --> 3045.92
[Music]

3044.24 --> 3048.64
it's so good

3045.92 --> 3050.96
oh every time i hear that it's just like

3048.64 --> 3054.0789999999997
wild the harp

3050.96 --> 3056.4
in the background oh so great

3054.079 --> 3057.599
one of the best

3056.4 --> 3059.359
mystery

3057.599 --> 3060.8
ghost music

3059.359 --> 3062.48
i've ever heard in

3060.8 --> 3065.3590000000004
movies

3062.48 --> 3068.96
but they really were like yeah

3065.359 --> 3070.7999999999997
trying that out

3068.96 --> 3072.7200000000003
but it works so great because it's not

3070.8 --> 3075.3590000000004
constantly that music because you get

3072.72 --> 3076.8799999999997
like the more silly

3075.359 --> 3080.48
city type

3076.88 --> 3080.48
atmosphere music as well

3080.88 --> 3086.319
and even like the the rock

3083.92 --> 3087.599
the main theme thing once the action

3086.319 --> 3090.0
really gets

3087.599 --> 3092.1600000000003
going and all that but they're just very

3090.0 --> 3094.319
careful in their music placement for

3092.16 --> 3096.72
each scene

3094.319 --> 3098.72
like the music is really like a backdrop

3096.72 --> 3101.2
feeling they're very careful in how

3098.72 --> 3105.0
they've engineered this it's really

3101.2 --> 3105.0
really well done

3122.4 --> 3125.4
this

3130.64 --> 3133.64
huh

3141.76 --> 3145.8390000000004
a south park man

3143.52 --> 3145.839
yay

3148.16 --> 3153.2
well most of it

3149.92 --> 3154.319
like they really like started to get

3153.2 --> 3156.319
just

3154.319 --> 3158.16
out of control in the end

3156.319 --> 3161.44
but they were it's almost like they

3158.16 --> 3164.3999999999996
actively start running in a ditch

3161.44 --> 3164.4
the last thing

3165.839 --> 3169.7599999999998
but

3167.2 --> 3169.7599999999998
i don't know

3170.48 --> 3175.52
like what they do is a form of art

3173.44 --> 3178.559
it really is and it is art in a

3175.52 --> 3179.44
consistent fashion like a very serious

3178.559 --> 3182.559
art

3179.44 --> 3185.28
cover of a joke universe

3182.559 --> 3188.52
and yeah i do definitely respect what

3185.28 --> 3188.52
they've done

3194.96 --> 3201.359
not all of it though there a lot of it

3196.72 --> 3201.359
is very kind of like liberally

3201.52 --> 3205.04
because they are liberals

3205.28 --> 3210.48
it's bizarre

3206.8 --> 3212.559
south park is just south park

3210.48 --> 3213.44
but at least it's consistently south

3212.559 --> 3214.8
park

3213.44 --> 3217.76
you know

3214.8 --> 3221.8
consistency is something that is

3217.76 --> 3221.8
valuable in some way

3223.44 --> 3226.96
because

3224.319 --> 3229.44
that that allows you to use it as an

3226.96 --> 3232.079
anchor any consistency is an anchor for

3229.44 --> 3232.079
the spirit

3232.96 --> 3239.76
so you don't drift off into

3235.92 --> 3239.76
lack of oversight fluidity

3240.16 --> 3243.16
right

3251.92 --> 3255.52
too squeaky for you

3256.72 --> 3260.2
what does that mean

3286.0 --> 3289.359
oh okay you didn't you don't like the

3288.24 --> 3292.359
voice ah

3289.359 --> 3292.359
okay

3301.599 --> 3306.319
well it's it's weird you know when south

3303.44 --> 3308.079
park first came out

3306.319 --> 3310.64
i couldn't stand it i thought it was

3308.079 --> 3312.7200000000003
just like ugh what is this

3310.64 --> 3315.2
this is so forced

3312.72 --> 3316.319
like the first season i just was like

3315.2 --> 3317.2799999999997
this is

3316.319 --> 3319.599
just

3317.28 --> 3322.1600000000003
garbage

3319.599 --> 3322.1600000000003
but then

3323.44 --> 3328.88
yeah the second season it's like oh it's

3325.839 --> 3330.319
almost like suddenly this consistency

3328.88 --> 3332.6400000000003
starts

3330.319 --> 3335.7599999999998
setting foot and seeping in and there's

3332.64 --> 3336.96
this just apparent structure forming out

3335.76 --> 3340.1600000000003
of nowhere

3336.96 --> 3342.2400000000002
of what this place is in that crazy

3340.16 --> 3344.16
cartoon world

3342.24 --> 3347.16
and then it started to become much more

3344.16 --> 3347.16
interesting

3350.24 --> 3354.4799999999996
because at first especially first season

3352.24 --> 3356.8799999999997
it's like this is just random garbage

3354.48 --> 3356.88
almost

3358.0 --> 3362.24
but then consistently certainly starts

3360.24 --> 3365.2799999999997
seeping and you can almost say that it's

3362.24 --> 3367.5989999999997
now over saturated with consistency

3365.28 --> 3370.2400000000002
right in the last few seasons

3367.599 --> 3372.799
it's over saturated with consistency

3370.24 --> 3374.799
things are too consistent there's no

3372.799 --> 3376.96
more freedom it's like everything is

3374.799 --> 3379.2
contrived now everything

3376.96 --> 3382.88
and everything has

3379.2 --> 3384.5589999999997
a memory of everything now too

3382.88 --> 3388.319
so it's become this

3384.559 --> 3388.3190000000004
simulated bizarro

3388.839 --> 3394.799
reality where everything every stupid

3391.76 --> 3397.599
little thing almost becomes a story arc

3394.799 --> 3400.0
have you noticed that

3397.599 --> 3402.48
and it's such an

3400.0 --> 3405.48
absolute contrast with the start of it

3402.48 --> 3405.48
all

3415.2 --> 3419.04
well pj kurushank if you if you thought

3417.599 --> 3420.96
that was annoying

3419.04 --> 3425.24
i'd say

3420.96 --> 3425.2400000000002
start out at season three

3439.04 --> 3444.88
and yeah things get really good like in

3442.0 --> 3446.48
this like it gets really intense and

3444.88 --> 3447.28
heavy

3446.48 --> 3448.559
and

3447.28 --> 3451.119
interesting

3448.559 --> 3452.96
after that

3451.119 --> 3455.839
because if you really have to watch like

3452.96 --> 3457.599
the first few apps it's just garbage

3455.839 --> 3461.839
if you don't know anything about it if

3457.599 --> 3461.839
you've never gotten into it

3463.92 --> 3471.079
70 days until the party okay

3467.68 --> 3471.0789999999997
i guess so

3486.799 --> 3492.079
it's gonna be in september

3489.599 --> 3492.079
oh wait

3492.16 --> 3496.839
yeah

3493.839 --> 3496.839
hmm

3506.88 --> 3511.44
it would be nice to have 2 000

3508.96 --> 3514.0
subscribers though at the thousandth

3511.44 --> 3514.0
episode

3515.359 --> 3519.2799999999997
a special thousand hours

3517.52 --> 3521.7599999999998
yeah

3519.28 --> 3524.2400000000002
that's technically impossible

3521.76 --> 3524.2400000000002
literally

3529.44 --> 3533.599
4 000 okay okay

3532.24 --> 3536.0789999999997
that's

3533.599 --> 3536.079
creepy

3540.4 --> 3543.92
all right

3541.68 --> 3546.16
oh that would be a lot of two minute

3543.92 --> 3548.96
breaks in those

3546.16 --> 3551.2
thousand or four thousand hours

3548.96 --> 3554.44
anyway like now i'll be back i'll be

3551.2 --> 3554.4399999999996
right back

3623.92 --> 3626.92
uh

3640.319 --> 3643.48
all right

3670.88 --> 3677.119
yeah indeed return to them yeah cartman

3673.52 --> 3677.119
cartman is something special

3678.88 --> 3682.92
like he is the

3685.28 --> 3690.3190000000004
he's the one to always reveal the flaws

3687.68 --> 3692.16
and everything

3690.319 --> 3694.799
and to

3692.16 --> 3696.3999999999996
and to test everything and to

3694.799 --> 3698.799
mess it up

3696.4 --> 3700.64
and then cover up for it and then do it

3698.799 --> 3702.079
all over again that's cartman in a

3700.64 --> 3704.0
nutshell

3702.079 --> 3705.3590000000004
and we all love and hate him for well

3704.0 --> 3707.04
mostly love

3705.359 --> 3709.839
well at first you hate him for him but

3707.04 --> 3710.839
then eventually you start to like ah

3709.839 --> 3715.2799999999997
cartman

3710.839 --> 3715.2799999999997
is oh cartman

3715.76 --> 3719.76
and like the whole thing is messed up

3717.76 --> 3721.8390000000004
anyway with people like

3719.76 --> 3724.0
dying all over the place

3721.839 --> 3727.2799999999997
like regularly and then everything back

3724.0 --> 3729.68
to normal the next show so

3727.28 --> 3729.6800000000003
this is

3737.2 --> 3741.68
all right well at your own pace pj

3739.119 --> 3741.6800000000003
krishan

3742.16 --> 3746.16
right do remember

3744.24 --> 3747.839
it and it's always going to be like it

3746.16 --> 3750.0789999999997
gets worse in the end

3747.839 --> 3751.0389999999998
they are liberal right

3750.079 --> 3753.28
and

3751.039 --> 3756.48
especially in the last few seasons they

3753.28 --> 3758.079
like really start to do

3756.48 --> 3762.64
jokes

3758.079 --> 3765.44
with pc stuff quite literally

3762.64 --> 3766.24
and they actually get halfway decent at

3765.44 --> 3768.96
it

3766.24 --> 3771.0389999999998
but it's just

3768.96 --> 3772.799
poison

3771.039 --> 3775.28
in there

3772.799 --> 3777.7599999999998
and it's they're liberal right they they

3775.28 --> 3783.28
really are liberal they are really

3777.76 --> 3785.119
trying to make you understand liberal

3783.28 --> 3787.76
but they're doing their best as a lib

3785.119 --> 3789.599
they're not trying to be evil liberal

3787.76 --> 3792.6400000000003
but that

3789.599 --> 3792.6400000000003
it's complicated

3793.52 --> 3798.64
so yeah if you can't stand that ever

3796.96 --> 3802.52
then south park is probably always going

3798.64 --> 3802.52
to rob you the wrong way

3813.92 --> 3817.76
is it the one where kenny gets killed

3815.52 --> 3822.28
and if

3817.76 --> 3822.28
uh yeah that's south park

3834.799 --> 3838.799
and they do fool around with those

3836.559 --> 3841.44
mechanics too by the way like

3838.799 --> 3845.0389999999998
everything gets a backstory okay

3841.44 --> 3845.039
everything it's crazy

3845.359 --> 3853.119
but the backstories really start

3847.92 --> 3854.96
rolling in kind of like after two-thirds

3853.119 --> 3857.039
of everything

3854.96 --> 3858.7200000000003
before that it's just like they just

3857.039 --> 3861.5200000000004
throw it out there everything is just

3858.72 --> 3861.52
thrown out there

3862.64 --> 3868.48
right and a lot like what its core

3866.16 --> 3870.0789999999997
talent is is to basically

3868.48 --> 3873.28
assimilate

3870.079 --> 3877.2000000000003
popular movies

3873.28 --> 3879.3590000000004
so that they play out a movie

3877.2 --> 3882.24
to such extent that you really if you've

3879.359 --> 3884.48
seen those movies you recognize they are

3882.24 --> 3886.0
simulating a movie in it and then they

3884.48 --> 3887.76
completely

3886.0 --> 3889.92
south park it

3887.76 --> 3891.92
that happens a lot and they're really

3889.92 --> 3894.2400000000002
good at it

3891.92 --> 3896.559
like at first it's a bit like clunky and

3894.24 --> 3900.0789999999997
then very quickly

3896.559 --> 3902.48
pretty much for half the entire show

3900.079 --> 3904.559
they get so good at it that it becomes

3902.48 --> 3906.4
like really like oh

3904.559 --> 3909.599
what are they what movie are they

3906.4 --> 3912.48
simulating now oh i get this oh

3909.599 --> 3914.7200000000003
yeah it's i don't

3912.48 --> 3915.839
south park either you love it or you

3914.72 --> 3918.0789999999997
hate it

3915.839 --> 3919.44
or you hate it and then eventually learn

3918.079 --> 3921.6800000000003
to love it

3919.44 --> 3924.77
i don't know

3921.68 --> 3924.77
[Music]

3943.28 --> 3948.1600000000003
oh man

3944.64 --> 3949.5989999999997
do you guys remember that crazy crazy

3948.16 --> 3953.2799999999997
episode

3949.599 --> 3955.2000000000003
about like 9 11 conspiracy stuff

3953.28 --> 3958.1600000000003
like in the show

3955.2 --> 3961.0389999999998
and they like make it completely out of

3958.16 --> 3963.7599999999998
control it's it's like a

3961.039 --> 3967.44
conspiracy on a conspiracy it's so

3963.76 --> 3970.7200000000003
brilliant what they've done like they

3967.44 --> 3973.599
south spark is extremely psychologically

3970.72 --> 3974.64
revealing right

3973.599 --> 3978.96
they

3974.64 --> 3980.5589999999997
reveal to you how crazy people are and

3978.96 --> 3983.28
how that works

3980.559 --> 3986.079
they basically put down the insanity in

3983.28 --> 3988.2400000000002
a way that you know people will be like

3986.079 --> 3990.4
that

3988.24 --> 3991.52
and don't even realize it

3990.4 --> 3993.839
that's

3991.52 --> 3994.799
something that happens a lot in south

3993.839 --> 3997.68
park

3994.799 --> 3999.7599999999998
they simulate this the insanity that is

3997.68 --> 4003.359
in ways actually happening out there

3999.76 --> 4006.2400000000002
they sometimes overblow it

4003.359 --> 4008.64
but in the core of it they usually don't

4006.24 --> 4010.3999999999996
they usually base it on

4008.64 --> 4014.5589999999997
yeah on actual

4010.4 --> 4014.559
insanity out there in the real world

4018.96 --> 4021.839
oh god

4055.2 --> 4060.3999999999996
yeah they have some very revealing

4058.88 --> 4064.7200000000003
episodes

4060.4 --> 4066.4
like very very revealing

4064.72 --> 4069.839
like the time they

4066.4 --> 4069.839
the episode about

4070.559 --> 4074.079
about scientology

4072.88 --> 4078.2400000000002
they just

4074.079 --> 4080.96
put it all down like as a joke

4078.24 --> 4082.9599999999996
but they actually reveal things that are

4080.96 --> 4085.68
not a joke it's

4082.96 --> 4088.559
wow dude at the time that was like they

4085.68 --> 4091.0389999999998
got into big trouble over that

4088.559 --> 4092.88
and i think they like scientology like

4091.039 --> 4096.159000000001
try to sue them or something it's like

4092.88 --> 4098.2390000000005
holy [ __ ] they really went at it

4096.159 --> 4101.3589999999995
and and that's just one thing

4098.239 --> 4102.959999999999
the mormons get a treatment

4101.359 --> 4105.839
and

4102.96 --> 4105.839
just everything

4105.92 --> 4111.04
everything gets a treatment

4108.0 --> 4111.04
one way or the other

4114.4 --> 4119.839
the eric dube southwork skit

4117.359 --> 4119.839
uh

4137.04 --> 4142.4
oh team america oh god that thing oh

4141.199 --> 4145.4
wow

4142.4 --> 4145.4
yeah

4148.719 --> 4152.2390000000005
finally i see what that said

4159.12 --> 4164.88
oh god yeah the china thing holy [ __ ]

4163.279 --> 4167.92
yeah

4164.88 --> 4169.4400000000005
but that's very laid on but yeah that's

4167.92 --> 4171.359
south park right

4169.44 --> 4174.239
and there's like what is it now a

4171.359 --> 4176.56
thousand episodes or something crazy

4174.239 --> 4176.5599999999995
about

4183.359 --> 4186.839
a thousand

4184.799 --> 4188.4
no no

4186.839 --> 4191.2789999999995
maybe

4188.4 --> 4191.2789999999995
in the hundreds

4193.359 --> 4197.360000000001
yeah randy i love that guy i hate him

4196.08 --> 4199.5199999999995
and i love him

4197.36 --> 4203.04
but you know but that a lot of

4199.52 --> 4205.84
characters in there

4203.04 --> 4208.08
like they're all extremely well

4205.84 --> 4211.08
developed

4208.08 --> 4211.08
eventually

4221.92 --> 4227.32
about scientology well scientology is

4224.32 --> 4227.32
scientology

4230.08 --> 4232.5599999999995
i just

4232.64 --> 4235.4400000000005
know about it

4235.92 --> 4242.76
i actually knew somebody in my life

4238.96 --> 4242.76
that became a scientologist

4256.08 --> 4262.32
yeah the internet goes to ah dude

4259.84 --> 4263.92
it's all awesome

4262.32 --> 4266.159
it's a cult

4263.92 --> 4269.159
yeah well so is trinitarianism tom

4266.159 --> 4269.159
parker

4284.08 --> 4288.5599999999995
all right yeah pj yeah let's guys let's

4286.56 --> 4290.080000000001
just stop talking about south park

4288.56 --> 4293.4400000000005
because

4290.08 --> 4293.44
yeah pg chris shank

4294.96 --> 4299.159
let him watch some of it first

4304.32 --> 4307.28
oh yeah and by the way it's kenny and

4306.08 --> 4308.96
cartman

4307.28 --> 4311.759999999999
cartman

4308.96 --> 4311.76
not carter

4313.679 --> 4318.28
and don't forget stan and kyle

4329.199 --> 4334.32
ah

4330.48 --> 4336.959999999999
yeah butters is also one of my favorite

4334.32 --> 4340.0
characters

4336.96 --> 4341.52
who's extremely annoying by the way

4340.0 --> 4343.04
but the thing is

4341.52 --> 4346.320000000001
there's a guy

4343.04 --> 4349.84
that in ways i reflect to him a lot

4346.32 --> 4349.84
because he is like

4349.96 --> 4353.52
mortifyingly naive

4355.28 --> 4359.84
and i recognize those traits

4360.32 --> 4364.0
in ways i was like that

4364.32 --> 4370.04
and like even his

4366.719 --> 4370.04
what is it

4370.32 --> 4374.159
uh

4371.76 --> 4375.76
super hero alternative character like

4374.159 --> 4376.879999999999
there's a whole superhero thing that

4375.76 --> 4379.280000000001
they all

4376.88 --> 4381.4400000000005
get dragged into not literal but just

4379.28 --> 4385.5199999999995
like they play superheroes and that's

4381.44 --> 4389.759999999999
like a long-standing theme eventually

4385.52 --> 4392.0
and butters has this evil alter ego

4389.76 --> 4394.96
where he really just tries to express

4392.0 --> 4398.0
his frustration with

4394.96 --> 4401.28
always trying to be good

4398.0 --> 4401.28
and i love that

4402.159 --> 4407.679
like i can't stand that that little

4405.12 --> 4410.32
bastard this is not he's not a bad he is

4407.679 --> 4412.719
such a good guy it's so annoying

4410.32 --> 4414.96
but like in the end like i really

4412.719 --> 4417.6
appreciate butters in the end and he's

4414.96 --> 4420.56
made like some peace deals dude

4417.6 --> 4421.76
like he's a peacemaker and he's really

4420.56 --> 4423.52
serious

4421.76 --> 4426.4800000000005
he's just always acting like he's

4423.52 --> 4427.4400000000005
complete dumbass

4426.48 --> 4430.799999999999
but

4427.44 --> 4434.159
like a naive good guy dumbass

4430.8 --> 4436.88
but he really is very serious in nature

4434.159 --> 4438.719
you'll find out in the end anyway

4436.88 --> 4441.84
let's stop about yeah professor chaos

4438.719 --> 4441.84
that's the one right

4442.8 --> 4446.0
yeah

4443.76 --> 4448.719
ah there's so many good so many good

4446.0 --> 4448.719
shows in there

4449.04 --> 4454.239
so every now and then like every few

4452.239 --> 4456.4
years i do go like on a marathon and

4454.239 --> 4458.5599999999995
just like

4456.4 --> 4462.48
watch it all

4458.56 --> 4462.4800000000005
and it usually like takes me

4462.64 --> 4466.719
two weeks at least

4464.56 --> 4468.8
usually a month to get through it all

4466.719 --> 4471.44
you can't watch all that [ __ ] in a row

4468.8 --> 4473.679
you'll get sick literally because

4471.44 --> 4476.08
there's also too much violence in there

4473.679 --> 4476.08
as well

4477.84 --> 4482.12
and just too many things

4493.52 --> 4497.159000000001
anyway yeah enough

4500.4 --> 4503.92
okay talk about yeah sure okay well if

4502.4 --> 4507.239
everybody wants to talk about south park

4503.92 --> 4507.2390000000005
that's fine

4518.64 --> 4523.52
what's the take on kobe oh really

4521.44 --> 4525.839999999999
well yeah watch the last episode they're

4523.52 --> 4525.84
all

4526.239 --> 4528.959999999999
terrified

4530.239 --> 4537.04
like everybody in there is absolutely

4533.64 --> 4541.1990000000005
maniacally provax

4537.04 --> 4543.679
seriously in the it's really creepy

4541.199 --> 4546.239
it's really that i thought that the last

4543.679 --> 4548.2390000000005
special was really

4546.239 --> 4550.48
really creepy

4548.239 --> 4553.44
especially in the more we learn now it's

4550.48 --> 4555.839999999999
even more creepy but it like the very

4553.44 --> 4557.199
last part it it kind of ends up like

4555.84 --> 4560.32
help

4557.199 --> 4562.32
we are under illuminati attack

4560.32 --> 4565.36
like literally

4562.32 --> 4567.92
they literally show that by like help we

4565.36 --> 4570.08
don't have control over our works it's a

4567.92 --> 4573.28
joke but it's probably also a series

4570.08 --> 4573.28
where literally just

4573.44 --> 4578.0
reality starts to get warped because

4575.44 --> 4580.639999999999
supposedly an unseen hand is just

4578.0 --> 4583.12
erasing things and

4580.64 --> 4584.8
mutating it on the spot because they are

4583.12 --> 4586.48
the artist and they can do whatever the

4584.8 --> 4590.1990000000005
[ __ ] they want and

4586.48 --> 4590.199
they it's crazy

4604.159 --> 4607.12
so yeah

4605.76 --> 4612.0
when that

4607.12 --> 4612.0
came out i did not appreciate it at all

4613.12 --> 4617.599999999999
for the stance that's like

4615.36 --> 4620.96
yes that is what they do

4617.6 --> 4624.320000000001
it's just that this is a really really

4620.96 --> 4627.44
messed up real world situation in ways

4624.32 --> 4629.679
that makes that extremely creepy and

4627.44 --> 4629.678999999999
like

4633.52 --> 4638.080000000001
in a way like the original effect

4635.92 --> 4640.4800000000005
wouldn't work that much

4638.08 --> 4642.159
because it's it's like almost not funny

4640.48 --> 4644.4
anymore

4642.159 --> 4644.4
right

4646.4 --> 4649.719
i don't know

4651.28 --> 4656.679
i never consider them to be little oh

4653.199 --> 4656.678999999999
yeah they are

4668.64 --> 4676.08
they are liberal they're just not

4672.0 --> 4678.239
christ allergic liberal type

4676.08 --> 4681.92
they literally have the jesus character

4678.239 --> 4681.919999999999
in in the entire thing

4684.08 --> 4689.44
like in their cosmogeny they literally

4686.64 --> 4691.679
have jesus there

4689.44 --> 4696.36
and god and satan

4691.679 --> 4696.36
and they all have their things they do

4717.84 --> 4725.4400000000005
no no return to them that's absolutely

4720.719 --> 4725.44
not that pandering to no

4727.6 --> 4731.84
no that that wouldn't work no they are

4729.76 --> 4734.64
they are liberal they're very liberal

4731.84 --> 4737.360000000001
they're just not

4734.64 --> 4739.52
they're like oh they're new old liberal

4737.36 --> 4742.159
it's

4739.52 --> 4746.400000000001
they're not neo-feudalists

4742.159 --> 4749.04
they are very very pro-freedom

4746.4 --> 4751.5199999999995
like fanatically

4749.04 --> 4753.12
right that sort of liberal not the

4751.52 --> 4755.92
neo-feudalist

4753.12 --> 4758.08
conspiracy demonic pieces of [ __ ]

4755.92 --> 4760.2390000000005
liberals that have nothing to do with

4758.08 --> 4763.92
liberals anymore and they just lie about

4760.239 --> 4765.12
everything yeah not that sort of liberal

4763.92 --> 4768.4
right

4765.12 --> 4769.76
not power hungry demon liberals but just

4768.4 --> 4773.28
actually

4769.76 --> 4773.280000000001
freedom obsessed

4773.52 --> 4778.2390000000005
eccentric

4775.12 --> 4781.04
liberals the old sort

4778.239 --> 4783.839999999999
the artists the

4781.04 --> 4783.84
the weirdos

4784.0 --> 4788.92
never seen these guys they are pretty

4785.92 --> 4788.92
weird

4817.76 --> 4825.2390000000005
cartman loved luck oh yes oh yes he did

4822.0 --> 4825.239
no more

4854.8 --> 4857.8
right

4864.719 --> 4870.0
all right so yeah if i say

4867.52 --> 4873.52
like in my in in my general way of

4870.0 --> 4877.199
talking how i do that on my show right

4873.52 --> 4879.280000000001
if i just call somebody liberal

4877.199 --> 4881.36
that kind of means

4879.28 --> 4883.44
their

4881.36 --> 4885.759999999999
old-fashioned liberals like how it used

4883.44 --> 4889.0
to be freedom loving freedom of speech a

4885.76 --> 4889.0
bit eccentric

4889.36 --> 4892.639
right freedom

4891.52 --> 4895.92
but

4892.639 --> 4898.88
if i'm talking about like

4895.92 --> 4900.96
the creepy ones the psychos the the

4898.88 --> 4902.88
demons the liars

4900.96 --> 4904.56
then i wouldn't just call them liberal i

4902.88 --> 4906.719
would never just calmly i would call

4904.56 --> 4908.080000000001
them liberal

4906.719 --> 4910.4800000000005
like

4908.08 --> 4912.239
because

4910.48 --> 4915.919999999999
like that's just

4912.239 --> 4920.08
the name they mark themselves with when

4915.92 --> 4920.08
they are absolutely the opposite

4920.239 --> 4925.44
they're not liberal they just they take

4923.12 --> 4928.239
freedom they don't give it

4925.44 --> 4928.239
they take it

4928.84 --> 4934.08
right so just so you realize that

4932.719 --> 4936.4
i'm just going to call somebody a

4934.08 --> 4938.48
liberal that doesn't mean oh that

4936.4 --> 4941.04
i'm implying

4938.48 --> 4942.839999999999
they are the

4941.04 --> 4947.0
extreme

4942.84 --> 4947.0
leftists neo-feudalist

4947.76 --> 4953.159000000001
it just means they're like

4949.52 --> 4953.159000000001
old-style liberals

4970.0 --> 4973.0
hmm

4985.6 --> 4991.4400000000005
oh yeah yeah return to for sure owen

4987.76 --> 4991.4400000000005
benjamin knows about south park

4992.719 --> 4996.28
of course he does

5007.52 --> 5011.84
hey hm where are you huh

5012.159 --> 5015.48
what's that

5016.0 --> 5020.239
brilliant helps you see math in a new

5017.84 --> 5021.92
thanks i love it

5020.239 --> 5025.678999999999
i love it when i

5021.92 --> 5027.04
pop up quickly over the bar

5025.679 --> 5029.12
click mute

5027.04 --> 5030.08
and then it starts playing the sound

5029.12 --> 5034.159
anyway

5030.08 --> 5034.159
enough to do it again that's just lovely

5034.32 --> 5040.32
oh that guy again huh

5036.96 --> 5043.32
trey smith right right okay

5040.32 --> 5043.32
oh

5043.76 --> 5046.719
hello agm

5048.719 --> 5052.04
is it now

5096.239 --> 5103.759999999999
right so yeah guys i still have some

5100.88 --> 5106.400000000001
half hour to go

5103.76 --> 5108.2390000000005
what do we want to talk about

5106.4 --> 5112.28
what do you want to talk about

5108.239 --> 5112.28
flat earth something maybe

5122.96 --> 5127.2390000000005
yeah yeah i do classical homeopath

5128.0 --> 5131.84
it's very tough to watch sometimes

5130.32 --> 5132.799999999999
though

5131.84 --> 5135.52
because

5132.8 --> 5137.52
i guess it is all ironic but like some

5135.52 --> 5138.400000000001
things shouldn't even be

5137.52 --> 5142.320000000001
said

5138.4 --> 5142.32
an ironic ironically right

5142.56 --> 5148.159000000001
like

5144.4 --> 5148.159
it feels sometimes they do like

5150.48 --> 5155.839999999999
take a little risk here and there

5152.639 --> 5155.84
but it's up to them right

5156.4 --> 5161.199
and it is very amusing

5159.12 --> 5163.28
it is it is kind of fascinating what

5161.199 --> 5166.08
they do

5163.28 --> 5166.08
a little trick

5166.719 --> 5171.52
but yes i have

5168.48 --> 5174.799999999999
been watching the gnn episodes

5171.52 --> 5174.8
they were very interesting

5178.88 --> 5182.639
like they have to be a little careful

5180.8 --> 5185.52
though they don't get too much in the

5182.639 --> 5186.56
character when they do that series

5185.52 --> 5188.400000000001
right

5186.56 --> 5191.280000000001
when you act

5188.4 --> 5191.28
like a demon

5191.36 --> 5197.28
you basically emulated

5195.6 --> 5200.2390000000005
[ __ ] can happen

5197.28 --> 5200.239
that's all i'm saying

5203.28 --> 5208.679
you gotta be careful

5205.04 --> 5208.679
even as a joke

5213.04 --> 5216.04
so

5282.0 --> 5285.239
that's hilarious

5295.12 --> 5298.12
hmm

5320.32 --> 5324.84
l h f

5321.84 --> 5324.84
what

5340.08 --> 5344.8
what what does that stand for return to

5342.4 --> 5344.799999999999
normal

5349.44 --> 5356.12
lost his oh right oh yeah yeah

5352.8 --> 5356.12
sure he does

5365.36 --> 5370.239
yeah own benjamin has touched on things

5367.52 --> 5372.080000000001
like the mud flood

5370.239 --> 5374.08
and all just

5372.08 --> 5375.36
high awareness of alternative history

5374.08 --> 5377.36
but also

5375.36 --> 5379.44
he has engaged in a very interesting

5377.36 --> 5382.96
process of trying to basically figure

5379.44 --> 5382.96
out like the spells of

5383.679 --> 5389.36
those that preceded us like how do we

5386.56 --> 5392.400000000001
look at our own

5389.36 --> 5395.759999999999
national histories and the stories and

5392.4 --> 5395.759999999999
like what is really going on

5400.4 --> 5405.679
and he has like very crazy and

5403.199 --> 5407.36
maybe even true but still presents it as

5405.679 --> 5409.4400000000005
a joke

5407.36 --> 5410.719
things about like the founding fathers

5409.44 --> 5413.678999999999
and stuff

5410.719 --> 5415.84
apparently washington was a lesbian

5413.679 --> 5415.84
what

5416.159 --> 5419.92
and

5417.199 --> 5419.919999999999
then of course

5420.32 --> 5424.719
was it

5421.52 --> 5427.76
benjamin franklin mr thundertalk that

5424.719 --> 5432.52
was just amazing that sketch

5427.76 --> 5432.52
and the song was made for it awesome

5440.159 --> 5444.48
but yeah yeah it definitely caught on to

5442.4 --> 5445.599999999999
own benjamin that

5444.48 --> 5446.718999999999
there were

5445.6 --> 5449.360000000001
very

5446.719 --> 5451.84
amazing

5449.36 --> 5454.08
unbelievable buildings in the united

5451.84 --> 5456.8
states when the colonists arrived that

5454.08 --> 5459.6
they definitely did not just build out

5456.8 --> 5461.52
of nothing in a couple of years

5459.6 --> 5464.159000000001
like monumental

5461.52 --> 5464.159000000001
buildings

5465.6 --> 5469.120000000001
spread around the united states

5469.679 --> 5474.56
like just like here in europe when here

5471.679 --> 5477.36
in europe those things took ages

5474.56 --> 5479.4400000000005
to make and it's even officially it just

5477.36 --> 5481.5199999999995
we don't even know like how it was

5479.44 --> 5483.28
really made like what's really going on

5481.52 --> 5484.159000000001
with these

5483.28 --> 5485.84
just

5484.159 --> 5488.32
absurdly

5485.84 --> 5488.32
vast

5488.4 --> 5494.239
unbelievably designed buildings

5491.44 --> 5494.239
here in europe

5494.88 --> 5499.52
but yeah those buildings were in the

5496.96 --> 5500.719
united states or still are

5499.52 --> 5503.280000000001
there

5500.719 --> 5504.4
when suppo like oh the colonists made

5503.28 --> 5506.719
them

5504.4 --> 5508.48
uh

5506.719 --> 5510.96
with

5508.48 --> 5513.678999999999
a horse and

5510.96 --> 5517.199
like bandwagon

5513.679 --> 5518.0
maybe a couple of metal tools and a gun

5517.199 --> 5520.32
like

5518.0 --> 5520.32
really

5527.84 --> 5532.32
what's that

5530.239 --> 5534.638999999999
i want to see oh

5532.32 --> 5537.639
yeah i heard the guy was going away from

5534.639 --> 5537.639
youtube

5550.4 --> 5555.679
i don't know what he's on about though

5553.36 --> 5557.5199999999995
this last those last couple of videos

5555.679 --> 5559.04
seems just very complaining i wonder

5557.52 --> 5560.639
like why

5559.04 --> 5564.719
what's really going on here i don't even

5560.639 --> 5566.4800000000005
know who that guy is he's just reading

5564.719 --> 5567.44
and he probably a script he probably

5566.48 --> 5569.919999999999
wrote

5567.44 --> 5571.12
for those videos so like who is this guy

5569.92 --> 5572.4800000000005
even

5571.12 --> 5575.04
i don't know

5572.48 --> 5576.239
maybe he just run ran out of material so

5575.04 --> 5578.719
he just

5576.239 --> 5580.32
wanted to

5578.719 --> 5582.639
go exit

5580.32 --> 5584.799999999999
and then give conjure a reason for i

5582.639 --> 5586.88
don't know i don't know who he is i just

5584.8 --> 5589.12
know that i watch his videos and yeah

5586.88 --> 5590.88
they were interesting

5589.12 --> 5594.159
that's it

5590.88 --> 5596.159000000001
that's all i know about him

5594.159 --> 5597.679
because

5596.159 --> 5600.719
like

5597.679 --> 5604.159
who curse like what the hell does any of

5600.719 --> 5604.159
that matter to anything

5605.12 --> 5610.239
right it just seems like a giant red

5607.52 --> 5612.2390000000005
herring to me really it's just all whiny

5610.239 --> 5615.04
and complaining about

5612.239 --> 5617.28
somebody in a community oh like that's

5615.04 --> 5620.32
never had dude that's shit's been going

5617.28 --> 5621.84
down since 2015

5620.32 --> 5624.88

5621.84 --> 5626.88
oh somebody came after you oh

5624.88 --> 5631.04
like were you born yesterday or

5626.88 --> 5634.2390000000005
something that [ __ ] happens all the time

5631.04 --> 5638.159
i got plenty of people that go after me

5634.239 --> 5638.159
as well they really don't like me

5641.04 --> 5645.12
right

5642.639 --> 5647.6
i think that i'm like a

5645.12 --> 5650.88
fake this fake that

5647.6 --> 5650.88
chill agent

5651.6 --> 5655.6
think of it now think about it that's

5653.76 --> 5657.04
just gonna happen there's nothing you

5655.6 --> 5660.320000000001
could do about it

5657.04 --> 5662.32
it's no reason to stop

5660.32 --> 5664.32
your activities

5662.32 --> 5666.799999999999
that just seems like a red herring

5664.32 --> 5668.639
excuse for me but yeah i don't know who

5666.8 --> 5671.639
he is i don't even know what he looks

5668.639 --> 5671.639
like

5673.92 --> 5678.4
i just know that i liked his videos

5675.84 --> 5678.400000000001
that's all

5679.28 --> 5685.239
he has as much

5681.0 --> 5685.239
identification as rumpus

5687.04 --> 5693.119
right we don't know who that is

5689.36 --> 5693.119
and he's been on the scene for years

5697.44 --> 5702.08
so yeah i i wouldn't pay too much

5699.52 --> 5704.56
attention to

5702.08 --> 5705.6
behind the scene complaining [ __ ] from

5704.56 --> 5708.8
people

5705.6 --> 5712.84
that don't even like

5708.8 --> 5714.56
actually reveal who they are and do live

5712.84 --> 5717.52
interactions

5714.56 --> 5720.719
like it's just somebody who makes videos

5717.52 --> 5720.719
like what does it matter

5720.96 --> 5726.159
they're not even gonna actually

5723.679 --> 5729.6
appear as a person on the scene then

5726.159 --> 5731.5199999999995
what does it matter

5729.6 --> 5735.04
they want to quit they quit they want to

5731.52 --> 5735.040000000001

5771.44 --> 5775.5199999999995
i mean

5772.4 --> 5778.0
or just an email address that he gets

5775.52 --> 5780.56
emails from

5778.0 --> 5783.199
i mean he didn't gave him like the login

5780.56 --> 5785.360000000001
access to his email right i hope that i

5783.199 --> 5788.48
hope that's not what you mean

5785.36 --> 5791.36
that's what i thought you meant actually

5788.48 --> 5793.919999999999
but oh people emailing you and harassing

5791.36 --> 5798.08
you oh yeah welcome to flat earth

5793.92 --> 5800.159
sorry dude that's what happens

5798.08 --> 5802.08
weirdos get obsessed with you and then

5800.159 --> 5806.599999999999
they just start to

5802.08 --> 5806.6
nag you that's just how it works

5819.92 --> 5824.28
that's what's in me was stupid okay

5826.48 --> 5830.5199999999995
yeah just don't do that

5876.96 --> 5879.6
anyway

5879.679 --> 5884.0
uh flat earth debates looking forward to

5883.28 --> 5886.5599999999995
it

5884.0 --> 5888.8
i should just go live in 15 minutes from

5886.56 --> 5888.8
now

5907.36 --> 5911.159
what is he up to

5923.44 --> 5927.44
man i can't keep track of everything

5925.84 --> 5929.679
it's like

5927.44 --> 5934.0
you can't keep track of like thousands

5929.679 --> 5934.0
of people what they're doing right

5935.119 --> 5938.96
i remember when mark sergeant and

5936.96 --> 5940.88
patricia steer went live and mark would

5938.96 --> 5943.04
always do a

5940.88 --> 5944.639
like a field test on how much is out

5943.04 --> 5946.639
there

5944.639 --> 5949.84
and it's just so many

5946.639 --> 5952.0
flat earthers of good types and terrible

5949.84 --> 5953.679
types as well just so much out there you

5952.0 --> 5955.36
can't keep track of it it's like oh you

5953.679 --> 5957.1990000000005
bump into somebody they're actually kind

5955.36 --> 5959.36
of cool

5957.199 --> 5960.879999999999
well three years later

5959.36 --> 5963.119
there's a good chance

5960.88 --> 5965.52
it's just you met so many other people

5963.119 --> 5967.839999999999
you just forget about them

5965.52 --> 5967.84
right

5968.32 --> 5973.599999999999
they might still be active all that time

5970.8 --> 5976.400000000001
you just kind of forget about it you get

5973.6 --> 5978.159000000001
caught up in other groups

5976.4 --> 5981.679
so what happens

5978.159 --> 5983.679
because there's just so many people

5981.679 --> 5986.96
that get involved on flat earth i think

5983.679 --> 5986.96
the on average

5988.88 --> 5994.96
people

5990.239 --> 5998.959999999999
yeah let me let me populate this idea

5994.96 --> 6000.4
right so people do go on camera like for

5998.96 --> 6002.4
professional

6000.4 --> 6003.119
reasons

6002.4 --> 6004.159
like

6003.119 --> 6007.04
as a

6004.159 --> 6009.679
corporate representative perhaps or as

6007.04 --> 6012.56
as a host for a

6009.679 --> 6015.4400000000005
commercial endeavor something or even

6012.56 --> 6017.52
youtube people do that right

6015.44 --> 6020.4
now if they don't have some like

6017.52 --> 6023.84
professional financial interest how many

6020.4 --> 6023.839999999999
people do actually get on camera

6026.159 --> 6030.96
not that many i think

6029.04 --> 6033.6
like that actually start to represent

6030.96 --> 6033.6
themselves

6034.239 --> 6040.159
and and not just random

6037.04 --> 6040.159
sightings or whatever

6040.96 --> 6044.2390000000005
now maybe some people that are into

6042.56 --> 6046.159000000001
politics might do that

6044.239 --> 6046.959999999999
they might put themselves uh

6046.159 --> 6049.36
down

6046.96 --> 6052.0
on camera but other than that most

6049.36 --> 6054.0
people like they kind of stay behind the

6052.0 --> 6056.0
chat

6054.0 --> 6059.28
they might read out something and then

6056.0 --> 6062.96
make a video but very few people

6059.28 --> 6065.28
would actually come on screen like that

6062.96 --> 6067.36
well i think that on average people that

6065.28 --> 6069.92
have gone into flat earth

6067.36 --> 6072.08
i think that

6069.92 --> 6076.08
especially the ones that take it serious

6072.08 --> 6076.08
and want to work with it they all

6076.719 --> 6081.92
come out of the shadows and put

6079.36 --> 6084.159
themselves down as a flat earther i

6081.92 --> 6086.4
think that even happens more on average

6084.159 --> 6087.839999999999
with flat earthers than with non-flat

6086.4 --> 6089.679
earthers

6087.84 --> 6092.679
only

6089.679 --> 6092.679
like

6093.28 --> 6097.36
reveled

6094.88 --> 6098.32
by the corporate

6097.36 --> 6100.4
people

6098.32 --> 6102.5599999999995
that do that because you have to do that

6100.4 --> 6104.159
for professional reasons or you can't be

6102.56 --> 6106.2390000000005
taken serious

6104.159 --> 6110.159
you don't have a face to represent and

6106.239 --> 6110.159
it won't sell et cetera et cetera

6117.84 --> 6121.84
okay return to them we well i guess

6119.6 --> 6124.88
people are getting banned

6121.84 --> 6124.88
i don't know why though

6125.119 --> 6130.08
it could be that they just talked about

6127.36 --> 6133.599999999999
things that they shouldn't have

6130.08 --> 6136.48
according to youtube guidelines

6133.6 --> 6138.56
or they weren't careful enough

6136.48 --> 6141.599999999999
right that is kind of a seduction though

6138.56 --> 6142.88
for a lot of flat earth people are very

6141.6 --> 6144.8
impulsive

6142.88 --> 6146.84
and they just want to be straight up

6144.8 --> 6150.96
front straight to the point

6146.84 --> 6152.8
direct and maybe even a little alarmist

6150.96 --> 6154.8
they want to do that they want to like

6152.8 --> 6157.4400000000005
are we gonna do this

6154.8 --> 6161.76
they want that right well that's exactly

6157.44 --> 6161.759999999999
what youtube really cracks down on

6161.84 --> 6165.360000000001
exactly that

6164.0 --> 6168.48
now i

6165.36 --> 6170.92
talk about the subjects at hand the no

6168.48 --> 6173.199
no subjects as well but i do it

6170.92 --> 6176.56
completely different

6173.199 --> 6179.199
and that's why only recently i got that

6176.56 --> 6179.1990000000005
that strike

6179.679 --> 6184.719
even i've talked about these subjects at

6182.8 --> 6187.360000000001
hand

6184.719 --> 6190.88
no not so super straightforward and a

6187.36 --> 6193.04
little alarmist but i discussed them

6190.88 --> 6195.6
talked about it

6193.04 --> 6198.4
for a year for a year just the entire

6195.6 --> 6202.08
time i talked about it the entire time

6198.4 --> 6202.839999999999
the whole time every day right because

6202.08 --> 6206.32
you

6202.84 --> 6208.88
can but if you just want to be

6206.32 --> 6212.239
very overt very direct and a little

6208.88 --> 6213.119
alarmist yeah bang immediately so guess

6212.239 --> 6214.159
why

6213.119 --> 6216.719
i think

6214.159 --> 6220.0
a lot of the flat earth channels get

6216.719 --> 6222.2390000000005
struck down it's because

6220.0 --> 6224.159
they have utilized being attention

6222.239 --> 6225.678999999999
grabby as a default position in their

6224.159 --> 6227.679
flat earthing

6225.679 --> 6229.28
they want some attention they have this

6227.679 --> 6231.04
message they want to carry it's a good

6229.28 --> 6233.36
message they want to help people they

6231.04 --> 6238.0
want to warn them

6233.36 --> 6241.679
so they just do it but it's specifically

6238.0 --> 6243.04
not allowed to do it like that

6241.679 --> 6245.04
and then they get in trouble and then

6243.04 --> 6247.28
their channel gets deleted because they

6245.04 --> 6249.92
just had to do that

6247.28 --> 6251.679
right they had to do it

6249.92 --> 6253.6
they couldn't find another way to do

6251.679 --> 6255.52
that

6253.6 --> 6257.679
they had to be impulsive about it and

6255.52 --> 6261.8
direct and that's what youtube does

6257.679 --> 6261.8
crack down on overall

6269.199 --> 6274.239
right and yeah it isn't fair it's not

6271.92 --> 6276.88
fair that youtube does it it's not fair

6274.239 --> 6279.678999999999
that there is this bizarre censorship

6276.88 --> 6279.679
thing going on

6280.48 --> 6284.799999999999
although yes is it censorship is it

6282.88 --> 6286.2390000000005
officially censorship because it is

6284.8 --> 6288.08
corporate

6286.239 --> 6290.799999999999
right but it is effective censorship

6288.08 --> 6290.8
it's basically

6292.199 --> 6297.919999999999
manipulation in what they

6295.52 --> 6300.0
want you to put out

6297.92 --> 6302.4800000000005
and especially about

6300.0 --> 6304.239
current subjects that are unrolling

6302.48 --> 6306.239
right in the moment right in the hype

6304.239 --> 6308.159
when everybody wants to look it up and

6306.239 --> 6310.32
to figure out what it is right that's

6308.159 --> 6313.28
the moment that's the sweet spot

6310.32 --> 6315.759999999999
and that's when you're not allowed to

6313.28 --> 6317.679
overtly discuss it

6315.76 --> 6320.320000000001
because if you do

6317.679 --> 6320.32
then you get

6320.56 --> 6327.04
you approach the center danger point the

6324.08 --> 6329.5199999999995
critical mass for the spirit energy of

6327.04 --> 6331.44
the entire world of the web

6329.52 --> 6333.84
of the statistics of the millions of

6331.44 --> 6334.96
people going about in the virtual

6333.84 --> 6336.2390000000005
world

6334.96 --> 6339.44
computer

6336.239 --> 6339.44
internet virtual world

6339.6 --> 6344.96
they don't allow you to go there and

6342.719 --> 6347.199
become that center point if you have too

6344.96 --> 6348.639
much data that's on the

6347.199 --> 6351.44
occult list

6348.639 --> 6351.4400000000005
like flat earth

6351.52 --> 6356.0
just like no

6353.119 --> 6359.04
no you are not allowed to be at that

6356.0 --> 6361.28
sweet spot so that millions and millions

6359.04 --> 6363.84
of people can find you you're not

6361.28 --> 6368.08
allowed that you see

6363.84 --> 6368.08
because you didn't work with the program

6368.8 --> 6373.84
you don't occultize

6371.04 --> 6373.84
the info

6374.48 --> 6380.48
you deny things that are not allowed to

6376.639 --> 6382.56
be denied if you want to be in that spot

6380.48 --> 6384.159
see that's the that's the be system

6382.56 --> 6385.52
that's what they do that's how they

6384.159 --> 6388.4
censor you

6385.52 --> 6390.639
and flat earthers

6388.4 --> 6390.638999999999
yeah

6390.88 --> 6394.639
they want to be

6392.239 --> 6396.718999999999
open and direct and free

6394.639 --> 6399.52
well you can be that

6396.719 --> 6401.36
for yourself but when you're interfacing

6399.52 --> 6403.679
with the machine that's bound by these

6401.36 --> 6407.28
rules

6403.679 --> 6410.159
yeah well when you just don't adapt

6407.28 --> 6412.08
you get cut off

6410.159 --> 6415.239
nathan oakley's been talking about this

6412.08 --> 6415.239
as well

6415.76 --> 6419.2390000000005
he gets this

6430.08 --> 6433.6
i think you'll find most globers agree

6432.48 --> 6436.799999999999
with that

6433.6 --> 6438.56
right well that's a problem isn't it

6436.8 --> 6443.0
when everybody agrees with the flat

6438.56 --> 6443.0
earther that's not allowed

6443.679 --> 6447.6
it's not allowed to be recognized by

6446.4 --> 6450.08
people

6447.6 --> 6452.88
that there is a huge amount of people

6450.08 --> 6454.639
that would agree with that you see

6452.88 --> 6456.88
because we

6454.639 --> 6460.08
as flat earthers

6456.88 --> 6461.28
deal in subjects that are on the no go

6460.08 --> 6464.159
list

6461.28 --> 6466.32
for a lot of the general public

6464.159 --> 6466.32
like

6466.48 --> 6470.959999999999
a lot of the spells that are happening

6468.639 --> 6471.84
in the weave

6470.96 --> 6474.56
by

6471.84 --> 6476.639
by media by politics

6474.56 --> 6480.56
they cannot go there

6476.639 --> 6480.56
it's almost like the safe word

6480.88 --> 6484.4800000000005
it's the safe word

6483.119 --> 6487.04
flat earth

6484.48 --> 6490.638999999999
that makes it stop it can't work anymore

6487.04 --> 6493.36
after that because it's too revealing

6490.639 --> 6495.36
so as flat earthers you want to be in

6493.36 --> 6497.679
in the center of attention of current

6495.36 --> 6500.159
day events when everybody's all rushing

6497.679 --> 6502.0
to find information about something

6500.159 --> 6504.239
that's happening right then

6502.0 --> 6506.96
well it's too bad

6504.239 --> 6511.28
you're not allowed to be there

6506.96 --> 6511.28
because you deal in no-no subjects

6511.679 --> 6517.04
and besides the immediately

6514.88 --> 6519.1990000000005
the the things that are very immediately

6517.04 --> 6521.36
happening right now they are no no

6519.199 --> 6523.919999999999
subjects too well when you multiply one

6521.36 --> 6526.799999999999
no no subject by another no no subject

6523.92 --> 6530.08
that everybody wants to know about

6526.8 --> 6530.08
that's the triple no

6531.199 --> 6534.5599999999995
one no no subject the other no no

6533.44 --> 6537.119
subjects

6534.56 --> 6538.0
everybody wants to know that's a triple

6537.119 --> 6539.28
no

6538.0 --> 6540.88
you see

6539.28 --> 6544.96
you're not giving

6540.88 --> 6544.96
the beast system a lot of choice there

6548.96 --> 6551.28
right

6552.08 --> 6557.28
so if you want to talk about that

6555.199 --> 6558.879999999999
you're gonna have to make it a little

6557.28 --> 6562.48
cryptic

6558.88 --> 6565.04
by not mentioning key words

6562.48 --> 6566.879999999999
a single time and simply just lay out

6565.04 --> 6568.56
the structure

6566.88 --> 6570.56
and then people can fill it in

6568.56 --> 6573.119000000001
themselves and hey if you're actually

6570.56 --> 6575.599
good at that and i am

6573.119 --> 6578.32
fractal thinking then you might find

6575.599 --> 6580.639
that you can apply a lot of different

6578.32 --> 6583.5199999999995
subjects in different time periods to

6580.639 --> 6584.88
the formula that i laid out and it'll

6583.52 --> 6587.1990000000005
work

6584.88 --> 6589.4400000000005
how about that

6587.199 --> 6592.5599999999995
and i didn't have to mention one single

6589.44 --> 6595.5599999999995
trigger word isn't that just nice

6592.56 --> 6595.56
huh

6596.639 --> 6599.92
it's working just fine

6604.159 --> 6608.0
now of course i can't avoid the word

6606.239 --> 6609.759999999999
flat earth

6608.0 --> 6611.44
in those trigger words but that wouldn't

6609.76 --> 6614.719
make any sense it's literally in the

6611.44 --> 6614.719
title of every show

6617.44 --> 6625.04
but i'm not trying to get in the

6620.48 --> 6627.598999999999
attention sweet spot like this

6625.04 --> 6630.719
i'm leaving this to other people

6627.599 --> 6632.32
i'm basically expecting people that are

6630.719 --> 6635.199
bound to

6632.32 --> 6638.96
the occult that are bound to not mention

6635.199 --> 6641.839999999999
flatter to presuppose the opposing

6638.96 --> 6644.4800000000005
ideas the cosmogeny

6641.84 --> 6646.0
to pay attention to what i say and then

6644.48 --> 6647.839999999999
learn

6646.0 --> 6649.92
from me

6647.84 --> 6652.8
so they can apply the knowledge that i

6649.92 --> 6655.28
cannot directly talk about in their

6652.8 --> 6655.28
field

6655.679 --> 6660.2390000000005
of course a lot of people are trying

6657.52 --> 6662.96
this in some way or another

6660.239 --> 6665.759999999999
i just know how to do it

6662.96 --> 6668.719
without triggering

6665.76 --> 6668.719
sensor alarm

6668.8 --> 6672.320000000001
but just talking structure

6678.08 --> 6681.84
right but i think i'm going to round out

6679.599 --> 6681.84
the show

6686.0 --> 6690.239
it was interesting a couple of silent

6688.32 --> 6692.32
pauses though but yeah

6690.239 --> 6695.839999999999
that's some really confronting tough

6692.32 --> 6695.84
subject today as well

6697.28 --> 6700.8
and we talked about south park a little

6699.52 --> 6704.2390000000005
and bet

6700.8 --> 6704.2390000000005
somebody is gonna watch it

6704.719 --> 6708.4
and then of course censorship and yeah

6707.44 --> 6711.28
why

6708.4 --> 6713.839999999999
why is it there how is it triggered

6711.28 --> 6716.4
what should you be expecting how can you

6713.84 --> 6718.159000000001
avoid it

6716.4 --> 6719.199
and still talk about what you want to

6718.159 --> 6721.04
talk about

6719.199 --> 6723.598999999999
there's other people that are dedicating

6721.04 --> 6725.28
a lot of work to doing this matt

6723.599 --> 6727.52
from quantum of conscience is one of

6725.28 --> 6729.44
these people he figured out the hobo

6727.52 --> 6730.96
code i think he did he might have gotten

6729.44 --> 6732.96
it from somebody else i'm not sure but

6730.96 --> 6735.84
he's talked a lot about it and he

6732.96 --> 6737.92
applies it and other people have kind of

6735.84 --> 6741.1990000000005
tried it out as well

6737.92 --> 6741.1990000000005
i do it in my own way

6744.48 --> 6749.598999999999
i talk more structure because then

6747.52 --> 6752.159000000001
you'll be yeah you might be surprised to

6749.599 --> 6754.2390000000005
how many things it can apply

6752.159 --> 6756.32
even outside of my own current

6754.239 --> 6758.879999999999
understanding right this is a little

6756.32 --> 6761.04
trick that i found out a very long time

6758.88 --> 6763.76
ago and i talked about it even yesterday

6761.04 --> 6767.199
on yesterday's show

6763.76 --> 6767.1990000000005
how can you know things

6767.92 --> 6771.28
that you don't know

6771.44 --> 6777.4
by knowing how you will eventually know

6774.4 --> 6777.4
it

6778.08 --> 6783.199
it's the the

6779.8 --> 6785.28
progressive crystal of learning and

6783.199 --> 6787.44
insight like it

6785.28 --> 6788.8
will grow further so you have to assume

6787.44 --> 6791.28
that what you

6788.8 --> 6794.2390000000005
do not understand yet at some point you

6791.28 --> 6796.5599999999995
will and once you realize that then you

6794.239 --> 6799.44
can in some way

6796.56 --> 6800.719
build on that

6799.44 --> 6802.32
think about it

6800.719 --> 6804.639
right so anyway

6802.32 --> 6807.28

6804.639 --> 6810.2390000000005
