8.74 --> 42.940000000000005
[Music]

39.059 --> 49.32899999999999
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.94 --> 50.019
earlybird number one two three 123 I'm

49.329 --> 54.82
your host

50.019 --> 58.019
Arwen and today is the dreary rainy day

54.82 --> 62.94
had to go through it it sucks

58.019 --> 62.94
got totally wet still drying up from it

66.689 --> 77.35
yeah talking about early I've been up

71.1 --> 81.06
for eight hours I think

77.35 --> 83.55999999999999
like I got up incredibly early today I

81.06 --> 86.02
went to bed pretty early yesterday

83.56 --> 88.69
evening or night I don't remember if it

86.02 --> 96.58
was past 12 I think so but yeah I got

88.69 --> 97.83
really early up and I liked it so she

96.58 --> 104.2
was here

97.83 --> 113.07
Steve hm DJ Adagio Tommy Rogers Nathan

104.2 --> 113.07000000000001
Oakley good morning guys some coffee

117.9 --> 123.30000000000001
got myself ended up giving at the castle

124.02 --> 131.82
so yeah it's kind of funny this morning

133.44 --> 144.54
right as I was preparing to start up the

137.53 --> 147.39
show I yeah for some reason now I have a

144.54 --> 153.82
default Bing search engine

147.39 --> 156.13
whenever I start up Firefox yeah even

153.82 --> 161.7
with Firefox I don't know just usually

156.13 --> 166.69
use Google but yeah hold on

161.7 --> 170.48999999999998
and then this popped up right away this

166.69 --> 170.49
morning I thought it was kind of funny

177.17 --> 182.86999999999998
I guess I'm kind of simple that way but

180.74 --> 186.8
hey look who's there

182.87 --> 195.20000000000002
I got a guest right away hello peanuts

186.8 --> 197.63000000000002
karke what it is okay are you doing that

195.2 --> 198.76999999999998
that basically means how're you doing

197.63 --> 205.9
hey I didn't hear you

198.77 --> 209.54000000000002
sorry oh I know what it is what what is

205.9 --> 217.52
never mind oh right next time maybe like

209.54 --> 221.32999999999998
you Yuri Uranus by Voyager 2 right have

217.52 --> 227.75
you been yeah doing good oh yeah I don't

221.33 --> 230.09
like this weather at all don't I saw you

227.75 --> 233.87
had to uh you have to take your old

230.09 --> 237.02
money back huh yeah yeah I did actually

233.87 --> 240.89000000000001
get confirmation by the way that they

237.02 --> 243.08
received the return send so probably be

240.89 --> 250.1
getting them my money back pretty soon

243.08 --> 254.0
and I'll try again so it sounded good

250.1 --> 255.799
when it did work yeah but it didn't

254.0 --> 258.919
that's right

255.799 --> 260.93
and it's surprising I have another mic

258.919 --> 264.53
for testing as well I got it for free

260.93 --> 266.45
from a grid well so yeah he just had it

264.53 --> 269.03
laying around and I thanked him for

266.45 --> 271.15999999999997
trying at least for thinking of me but

269.03 --> 276.28
that won't suck kind of even more so

271.16 --> 279.53000000000003
still yeah the mic this is the Arwen mic

276.28 --> 282.14
for 5 euros or whatever maybe it was 10

279.53 --> 289.58
but it just it was incredibly cheap I've

282.14 --> 290.96
been using it for 3 years so for that

289.58 --> 295.31
price I think it's pretty incredible

290.96 --> 295.96999999999997
device in retrospect but yeah I do want

295.31 --> 298.91
to

295.97 --> 307.16
sounding one and I think a lot of people

298.91 --> 309.95000000000005
out there do that do want that yeah but

307.16 --> 313.52000000000004
yeah another there's a snippet detail

309.95 --> 315.46999999999997
the weird interruption stuff happening

313.52 --> 317.95
at the in for stream didn't happen

315.47 --> 322.16
yesterday evening was crystal-clear

317.95 --> 325.01
barely any reloads even so yeah that was

322.16 --> 332.53000000000003
kind of nice even though I didn't really

325.01 --> 332.53
watch it all so that was back to normal

332.74 --> 343.85
and yeah same old same old the usual

338.57 --> 347.93
stuff happening in the media a lot so

343.85 --> 350.69
what have you been up to a mom one

347.93 --> 356.90000000000003
second I'm making a cup of coffee yeah

350.69 --> 360.919
this [Â __Â ] will be loud one sec oh yeah

356.9 --> 364.47999999999996
by the way I also had a pretty long call

360.919 --> 368.83
one half hours with dation over skype

364.48 --> 368.83000000000004
and that was also productive

374.86 --> 380.62
it's weird like

377.5 --> 384.28
it's very difficult to explain like what

380.62 --> 387.67
I see with what he's dealing with cause

384.28 --> 390.64
he is like super hardcore on track with

387.67 --> 395.23
what he's doing but I'm just noticing

390.64 --> 397.0
that he's basically jumping bridges when

395.23 --> 398.71000000000004
the kind of shouldn't and that's a

397.0 --> 401.38
typical sign when you were like in a

398.71 --> 406.06
brain flow and you start to get hasty

401.38 --> 408.43
your ego starts to interfere and I'm

406.06 --> 411.55
trying to basically point that out and

408.43 --> 413.92
it's very tough because he's so

411.55 --> 416.92
convinced of everything that then you

413.92 --> 419.29
start to jump bridges the domain off

416.92 --> 421.51
bridges you just don't walk them you

419.29 --> 423.79
jump over and you assume they were there

421.51 --> 427.83
that kind of thing because it all seems

423.79 --> 430.69
to fit so great but yeah he did

427.83 --> 434.05
elaborate on his insights and they are

430.69 --> 437.95
pretty damn remarkable it is it is

434.05 --> 441.28000000000003
incredible how many things tie in to the

437.95 --> 445.22999999999996
method of thinking but yet there's still

441.28 --> 445.22999999999996
so much more to figure out like

447.53 --> 455.23999999999995
the electric bonding basically how

451.21 --> 458.03
matter is different types of electric

455.24 --> 461.87
states and that sense yeah we were

458.03 --> 464.39
talking about electrons protons protons

461.87 --> 469.61
and neutrons and then I thought yeah you

464.39 --> 473.06
know what according to his concept his

469.61 --> 477.5
approach an electron should actually be

473.06 --> 480.5
called a Negatron and if you start to

477.5 --> 483.95
see what it is then then suddenly the

480.5 --> 484.93
whole electric field based concept falls

483.95 --> 488.69
into place

484.93 --> 490.81
so yeah electrons should probably be

488.69 --> 495.16
called Megatron's

490.81 --> 498.16
then you understand proton Neutron

495.16 --> 498.16
Negatron

499.1 --> 505.39000000000004
anyway that was a little finding I had

501.35 --> 509.45000000000005
during that process but yeah he still is

505.39 --> 511.46
just automatically assuming that the

509.45 --> 515.0
same system works with the consciousness

511.46 --> 518.5699999999999
and subconsciousness and how we create

515.0 --> 522.2
things and and in my opinion he

518.57 --> 525.32
basically goes into like a sort of

522.2 --> 528.11
scientist mode because of just because

525.32 --> 530.9000000000001
of the insights is it starts to delve

528.11 --> 533.42
into scientism when he does that even

530.9 --> 535.76
though he is very convinced that he can

533.42 --> 537.89
prove it and he does do do stuff with it

535.76 --> 543.11
but I just think he goes a little bit

537.89 --> 549.22
too far and that's just human and my god

543.11 --> 554.33
he is wielding something big it's yeah

549.22 --> 558.14
it's almost like he's a little just a

554.33 --> 560.4200000000001
step further like I I can't really see

558.14 --> 563.27
as clear as he does about this kind of

560.42 --> 565.13
thing although I do get it and I

563.27 --> 570.05
definitely see the connections but he's

565.13 --> 572.38
just deeper into it and so yeah what's

570.05 --> 575.0
basically left for me is just to see the

572.38 --> 576.98
the signs of the social behavior and

575.0 --> 579.89
that is exactly the part that you start

576.98 --> 583.4200000000001
to ignore when you go obsess over a

579.89 --> 585.9399999999999
concept and I'm trying to help him out

583.42 --> 588.28
and I wish that when when I was younger

585.94 --> 593.95
that I had a lot of help whenever I got

588.28 --> 596.47
that because I I did go into like

593.95 --> 600.3100000000001
megalomaniacal territory and total

596.47 --> 603.28
solipsism as a result as well and that

600.31 --> 605.79
wasn't too healthy for me and for my

603.28 --> 612.6999999999999
social relations

605.79 --> 615.13
so I've often wondered you know if when

612.7 --> 618.72
I was a child if I was taught that there

615.13 --> 621.37
was an alternative way of thinking about

618.72 --> 624.4
where we live I've always wondered to

621.37 --> 627.82
where where that would have led me you

624.4 --> 630.61
know alright well because of the liberal

627.82 --> 636.82
nature of my family I was basically

630.61 --> 640.03
taught to find my own way and it worked

636.82 --> 643.09
cuz I had a lot of ideas but wait wait

640.03 --> 646.18
can you give me an example that you can

643.09 --> 649.0600000000001
be example well they they did tell me

646.18 --> 654.13
basically to figure it out for myself

649.06 --> 658.4499999999999
and and not by default believe in

654.13 --> 661.08
something the story they were very

658.45 --> 661.08
open-minded

662.04 --> 668.62
so so that did they even did they even

666.94 --> 674.6500000000001
give you these ideas or did they just

668.62 --> 676.84
say hey you're you figure it out no they

674.65 --> 679.15
will ever really give me ideas but I

676.84 --> 679.99
would be asking about a lot of stuff all

679.15 --> 682.51
the time

679.99 --> 687.34
that phase didn't end with me when I was

682.51 --> 689.26
six basically never stop but it but they

687.34 --> 692.89
did it and they they did it in a loving

689.26 --> 695.62
kind of way right so here's me well that

692.89 --> 699.67
they did it as responsibly as they could

695.62 --> 703.96
until I would drive them nuts because I

699.67 --> 706.03
could never get enough and I would

703.96 --> 708.72
overload their brains kind of like

706.03 --> 711.4499999999999
Bayesian is a little bit doing to me and

708.72 --> 714.52
probably some other people as well

711.45 --> 715.84
it's just so intense and you keep on

714.52 --> 718.39
wanting more and asking more questions

715.84 --> 720.73
but the people you're asking are having

718.39 --> 725.92
trouble keeping track of what you're on

720.73 --> 730.71
to see that's that's like the complete

725.92 --> 732.9399999999999
opposite of the way I way my parents

730.71 --> 736.6600000000001
either told me I was told that when I

732.94 --> 738.7
was a child if I didn't accept this man

736.66 --> 739.18
named Jesus that I was gonna burn in

738.7 --> 742.8100000000001
hell

739.18 --> 745.03
you know so of course you know of course

742.81 --> 749.0799999999999
I got I did it what they said you know I

745.03 --> 750.37
I did it solely on the fact that they

749.08 --> 752.89
were telling me that I was gonna burn

750.37 --> 756.58
girl it was like what the [Â __Â ]

752.89 --> 758.98
nobody wants that you know all right

756.58 --> 761.4100000000001
well my parents never told me anything

758.98 --> 764.0500000000001
like that and they did have pretty

761.41 --> 765.52
elaborate discussions about it about the

764.05 --> 769.029
possibilities and about the possibility

765.52 --> 771.819
of God in heaven and hell and

769.029 --> 774.66
we were very divided as a family like my

771.819 --> 777.7299999999999
brother was pretty hardcore atheist

774.66 --> 779.889
materialistic and I kind of fell in line

777.73 --> 782.1990000000001
with him especially when I was younger

779.889 --> 784.949
up until I was 17 pretty much and then

782.199 --> 790.5999999999999
suddenly I got my own spiritual

784.949 --> 792.55
revelations pattern all that week

790.6 --> 795.37
because the pattern just Falls almost

792.55 --> 797.319
it's also in lights seriously with what

795.37 --> 800.29
the agent is doing what it is is more

797.319 --> 802.81
from a material approach and mine was

800.29 --> 806.079
from a spiritual angle from the other

802.81 --> 811.689
side like trying to make sense of what

806.079 --> 814.7199999999999
is out there the other side you know and

811.689 --> 817.629
I guess there was had her own beliefs he

814.72 --> 820.269
believed in the Elysium fields that she

817.629 --> 825.1
would go there afterward and my

820.269 --> 827.579
grandmother I don't even know that was

825.1 --> 827.5790000000001
kind of weird

827.71 --> 837.279
so in a way I kind of look at it now and

831.88 --> 840.01
I I have kids myself now and I can learn

837.279 --> 844.029
from my childhoods and what I was told

840.01 --> 846.16
and how it affected me no I know what

844.029 --> 849.87
not so at least tell my children you

846.16 --> 853.0
know I would never tell my kids that

849.87 --> 855.91
they won't go a certain place if they

853.0 --> 859.45
don't accept you you would never tell

855.91 --> 862.81
them that well you should never start

859.45 --> 869.5
out talking like that should eventually

862.81 --> 881.8
come to that as a thing but I was just

869.5 --> 885.279
saying learning off what my parents just

881.8 --> 889.75
I just really think that a way a child

885.279 --> 893.67
is brought up really makes the outcome

889.75 --> 896.89
as that child grows up into an adult

893.67 --> 898.779
it's it's part of the reason why we're

896.89 --> 907.77
all different when you agree the whaler

898.779 --> 907.77
race partially but not entirely

909.089 --> 916.7090000000001
what can you tell me what would the

911.429 --> 922.949
other influences be besides parents what

916.709 --> 926.2489999999999
is inherent to our nature man's system

922.949 --> 928.3489999999999
that we live in I mean you have the

926.249 --> 933.989
impulses and then you get the culture

928.349 --> 936.119
and the - and the methods but what is in

933.989 --> 939.719
you kind of determines what you're going

936.119 --> 946.259
to be picking and what you'll get

939.719 --> 949.739
obsessed over or interested in or just

946.259 --> 955.229
what feels natural or the best to you in

949.739 --> 957.3290000000001
how to conduct yourself so yeah your

955.229 --> 962.219
parents can have a lot of influence they

957.329 --> 964.9789999999999
can push information on you or withhold

962.219 --> 968.089
information from you and then that way

964.979 --> 971.9390000000001
chiseling the way you look at the world

968.089 --> 974.3090000000001
until you find out what's actually going

971.939 --> 976.829
on and that may take a very long time

974.309 --> 980.039
some people may never figure it out and

976.829 --> 982.049
some just get it really quickly and get

980.039 --> 986.009
the motivations behind it and everything

982.049 --> 988.399
and then they move beyond it they're

986.009 --> 988.399
free

988.4 --> 997.3299999999999
so yeah I don't think it matters

993.92 --> 999.65
everything how you're taught

997.33 --> 1002.08
although yeah if it's very punishing

999.65 --> 1004.72
very conditioning then yeah you have to

1002.08 --> 1008.97
conditioning to deal with and that's

1004.72 --> 1008.97
sometimes a lot harder to get rid of

1009.36 --> 1019.75
right right I can see that conditioning

1015.52 --> 1021.93
is basically like a neurosis pushed on

1019.75 --> 1021.93
you

1027.25 --> 1032.689
but yeah

1029.15 --> 1034.3090000000002
I don't know you you your the way your

1032.689 --> 1041.9
parents raised you made a lot of the

1034.309 --> 1046.819
impact on use it I would say that it did

1041.9 --> 1048.049
for a while once I once I once I started

1046.819 --> 1052.539
getting older and once I started

1048.049 --> 1052.539
obviously experiencing things for myself

1053.71 --> 1063.89
obviously an adult is going to lean

1057.169 --> 1066.8300000000002
towards what interests them right I was

1063.89 --> 1071.6000000000001
a person that kind of rebelled from what

1066.83 --> 1074.6
my parents told me I was always taught

1071.6 --> 1077.899
you know not to have sex not to do drugs

1074.6 --> 1091.1789999999999
of course that's all I wanted to do you

1077.899 --> 1093.799
know so it's yeah you're always gonna

1091.179 --> 1098.45
get into some kind of oppositional

1093.799 --> 1102.26
situation is my parents were very leery

1098.45 --> 1106.179
with me but I got into these things

1102.26 --> 1108.799
anyway but not because I wanted to

1106.179 --> 1111.8600000000001
demanded that freedom because I got it

1108.799 --> 1115.1589999999999
but just because I just started to

1111.86 --> 1120.9699999999998
become curious and see I would influence

1115.159 --> 1120.97
other people right that's yeah so

1121.66 --> 1129.67
but I definitely did not push it too far

1125.31 --> 1133.54
it's always been never been very trying

1129.67 --> 1139.63
he's a very experimental with yeah drugs

1133.54 --> 1143.32
at all I'm very glad that I not poster

1139.63 --> 1145.45
dog it's great just cannabis and alcohol

1143.32 --> 1148.3799999999999
and that's like whoa dude

1145.45 --> 1151.48
cannabis and helpful what the [Â __Â ] plan

1148.38 --> 1154.1100000000001
plenty plenty of experience and

1151.48 --> 1154.1100000000001
extremities

1154.18 --> 1161.3500000000001
don't need anything else although it is

1158.71 --> 1165.19
out there of course but I'm not true

1161.35 --> 1168.1799999999998
oh yeah thinks like mushrooms you know

1165.19 --> 1171.7
I've never actually done that but I do

1168.18 --> 1173.8
think about it a lot like in what kind

1171.7 --> 1175.51
of context would I do that and how could

1173.8 --> 1178.2
I do it like really controlled and

1175.51 --> 1178.2
careful and

1178.5 --> 1183.659
just you have many people that do

1180.96 --> 1187.559
mushrooms some really fanatically and I

1183.659 --> 1189.3600000000001
know kind of like yeah how it is here

1187.559 --> 1192.059
from secondhand experience very

1189.36 --> 1194.07
elaborately from several different

1192.059 --> 1197.58
angles it's funny because they're like

1194.07 --> 1199.11
several types of responses that seem to

1197.58 --> 1201.0
come out of it and that is kind of

1199.11 --> 1207.0
similar to cannabis although cannabis

1201.0 --> 1209.49
has a much wider range of effects right

1207.0 --> 1211.769
in what it in differences that it can

1209.49 --> 1214.44
affect people with it's very interesting

1211.769 --> 1217.379
how that works but yeah the same goes a

1214.44 --> 1218.8500000000001
little for with mushroom experiences and

1217.379 --> 1221.4499999999998
then of course there are so many

1218.85 --> 1221.4499999999998
different

1225.26 --> 1229.37
now I'm gonna if I'm gonna do anything

1227.33 --> 1237.26
with that I'm gonna be very very careful

1229.37 --> 1239.4799999999998
and probably just not do it or maybe in

1237.26 --> 1243.77
the direction of just carefully sampling

1239.48 --> 1246.71
it so yeah it could never be chemical

1243.77 --> 1249.58
dose to an extent that it could have a

1246.71 --> 1252.77
real psychotropic effect rather I just

1249.58 --> 1255.6789999999999
assimilate a couple of molecules and see

1252.77 --> 1259.33
if my body can do something useful with

1255.679 --> 1262.5700000000002
that because it can sometimes

1259.33 --> 1265.84
I'd say that if you ever did decide to

1262.57 --> 1267.82
do it yeah make sure that you have

1265.84 --> 1270.84
friends around you that you trust you

1267.82 --> 1276.8799999999999
know obviously don't do it by yourself

1270.84 --> 1280.4499999999998
definitely know if I do anything like

1276.88 --> 1286.6000000000001
that I would probably do it in a setting

1280.45 --> 1288.5800000000002
of like a religious thing like I'd have

1286.6 --> 1290.8899999999999
to have like serious believers that

1288.58 --> 1294.1
understand the path that take it very

1290.89 --> 1298.5700000000002
seriously all that in order for them to

1294.1 --> 1301.57
be proper Guardians have a shadow side

1298.57 --> 1304.51
that's very contradictory to my energy

1301.57 --> 1307.06
that's gonna actually then bother me on

1304.51 --> 1309.43
the other side or whatever all that if

1307.06 --> 1313.36
I'm even if it's even gonna cause like a

1309.43 --> 1317.64
dark world effect I don't know maybe it

1313.36 --> 1317.6399999999999
will be like typical weird hallucination

1320.94 --> 1327.16
but well you you just you just don't

1324.22 --> 1328.66
want you don't want to wake up with a

1327.16 --> 1337.15
dick on your face you know what I mean

1328.66 --> 1341.77
I'm gonna pass I see that that the last

1337.15 --> 1344.3200000000002
time I did mushrooms right all all I can

1341.77 --> 1346.72
do was this laughs everything was just

1344.32 --> 1350.86
so funny come to a red light and it's

1346.72 --> 1352.66
just hilarious you know it was just

1350.86 --> 1355.8999999999999
everything I laughed at everything I

1352.66 --> 1360.01
didn't see anything I just laughed at

1355.9 --> 1362.74
everything yeah that that's nothing

1360.01 --> 1366.1
stupid happens with cannabis to a lot

1362.74 --> 1367.86
but yeah it happened to me like a lot in

1366.1 --> 1370.59
my teens when I did it

1367.86 --> 1372.7199999999998
it rarely had not actually that never

1370.59 --> 1374.79
happens really these days although

1372.72 --> 1376.98
sometimes yes things just make me laugh

1374.79 --> 1384.29
a lot don't necessarily need to be high

1376.98 --> 1386.88
for that but yeah with mushroom sure

1384.29 --> 1389.75
good imagine you could have a laughing

1386.88 --> 1392.96
fit right

1389.75 --> 1394.129
you know I just think that I think that

1392.96 --> 1397.3990000000001
there's just something there's something

1394.129 --> 1400.1899999999998
to either whether it be Kenner's whether

1397.399 --> 1403.2099999999998
it be psychedelics you know there's a

1400.19 --> 1406.909
reason for why it glows on the earth

1403.21 --> 1410.029
does that make sense kind of my day what

1406.909 --> 1412.75
I always thought maybe there's a reason

1410.029 --> 1414.11
why they grow on the earth you know and

1412.75 --> 1418.1
you know what

1414.11 --> 1420.1999999999998
yeah and just just like I was talking to

1418.1 --> 1423.86
Merle the other day and apparently

1420.2 --> 1427.22
there's there's a there's a frog or

1423.86 --> 1429.2199999999998
something that kind of kind of leaks

1427.22 --> 1431.8700000000001
some type of chemical on their back and

1429.22 --> 1437.3890000000001
you know people will lick the back of

1431.87 --> 1440.5089999999998
the Frog and it's like you know how how

1437.389 --> 1443.059
in the hell that someone figure out how

1440.509 --> 1445.759
to do that and the only way I can think

1443.059 --> 1452.35
of it is they were already on some type

1445.759 --> 1455.059
of psychedelic right no but just

1452.35 --> 1457.6689999999999
experimenting how do you think all the

1455.059 --> 1459.5
ancient shamans got their knowledge it

1457.669 --> 1460.929
just took big risks and it tried

1459.5 --> 1463.279
everything

1460.929 --> 1464.179
they just started taking up roads and

1463.279 --> 1468.769
nichkhun Inari

1464.179 --> 1472.49
yeah just try everything that's what

1468.769 --> 1476.049
they did or at least yeah look good it's

1472.49 --> 1480.6200000000001
like experimenting to them but more

1476.049 --> 1483.47
being the experiment it's just yeah and

1480.62 --> 1486.6789999999999
probably the shamans the very old ones

1483.47 --> 1488.21
they took it very seriously and maybe

1486.679 --> 1489.74
some of them even got killed in the

1488.21 --> 1492.74
process and then the others would learn

1489.74 --> 1495.94
from that like okay that's too far or

1492.74 --> 1500.44
you this you can do I don't know

1495.94 --> 1506.44
but the knowledge is there because

1500.44 --> 1510.96
people tried it out we wouldn't you hate

1506.44 --> 1515.0800000000002
to be the tester you know what I mean

1510.96 --> 1517.66
depends on what your motivation is it's

1515.08 --> 1523.12
like a holy task you feel you you are on

1517.66 --> 1525.19
the edge of research for your people you

1523.12 --> 1526.33
know even though it could be

1525.19 --> 1530.97
life-threatening

1526.33 --> 1533.74
yeah you would consider it like an honor

1530.97 --> 1535.42
well speaking on speaking like that let

1533.74 --> 1539.2
me ask you this and you'll have to

1535.42 --> 1543.3400000000001
answer if you wanted would you would you

1539.2 --> 1545.89
die to prove the fodder to the world how

1543.34 --> 1548.74
would that prove the flavors I'm just

1545.89 --> 1551.8000000000002
saying like if you if you if you had the

1548.74 --> 1555.79
chance you have to go out but I don't

1551.8 --> 1557.8
see how my my death could conjure up an

1555.79 --> 1562.98
independent variable in order to prove

1557.8 --> 1565.8999999999999
flat earth I'm just asking

1562.98 --> 1569.65
I'm not some people or passion about man

1565.9 --> 1572.89
I talk to Myrlie other day when he's

1569.65 --> 1575.8000000000002
Bowser everything it's it's kind of big

1572.89 --> 1581.65
especially right now it's just a piece

1575.8 --> 1586.21
of the puzzle middle piece it's it's

1581.65 --> 1588.4
almost like a crossing point it's almost

1586.21 --> 1593.5
like it's at that point right now I've

1588.4 --> 1597.7900000000002
been going into the 27 took me forgive

1593.5 --> 1601.27
me 24/7 Flat Earth is cool and I just

1597.79 --> 1603.58
been listening to these thousands of you

1601.27 --> 1606.0
know young little little minds come in

1603.58 --> 1610.86
they're asking about flatterers right

1606.0 --> 1614.05
and it's it's it's like the position of

1610.86 --> 1615.52
they have realized that there are a lot

1614.05 --> 1618.97
of people that think they're at this fly

1615.52 --> 1620.65
and they're interested in why of course

1618.97 --> 1623.8600000000001
some of the questions they ask are

1620.65 --> 1626.02
really dumb you know a lot of the

1623.86 --> 1628.9599999999998
questions are like hey do you think the

1626.02 --> 1632.51
moon is flat you know and it's like

1628.96 --> 1635.98
but no really when it comes to flutter

1632.51 --> 1638.59
it there's not a lot of stupid questions

1635.98 --> 1641.42
right the stupid questions are the ones

1638.59 --> 1643.6899999999998
you expect that they should know because

1641.42 --> 1647.63
it's been asked so many times out there

1643.69 --> 1649.91
are the stupidity lie in the laziness

1647.63 --> 1654.3500000000001
and not paying attention rather than the

1649.91 --> 1658.25
question itself because yeah the world

1654.35 --> 1661.0
is freaking surreal if you believe

1658.25 --> 1664.85
always that it was a ball and all that

1661.0 --> 1667.79
it's so totally different so any

1664.85 --> 1669.56
question is legitimate from that

1667.79 --> 1674.6299999999999
perspective if you're willing to

1669.56 --> 1678.29
actually look into it don't you think

1674.63 --> 1684.8000000000002
it's it's it's just amazing how such one

1678.29 --> 1686.72
idea can make such an up for and it can

1684.8 --> 1687.97
cause people really to get to trigger of

1686.72 --> 1692.26
course you know you don't hear a lot of

1687.97 --> 1694.3700000000001
immature people come in there and I

1692.26 --> 1697.43
guess they don't know how to deal with

1694.37 --> 1699.1699999999998
it because what they've been taught all

1697.43 --> 1701.8100000000002
their life you got a group of people

1699.17 --> 1703.8200000000002
saying then it's a lie and these people

1701.81 --> 1705.62
the only weights if they deal with it

1703.82 --> 1708.59
it's a religion of course they're

1705.62 --> 1712.3999999999999
responding like this it's like you

1708.59 --> 1715.79
imagine like a group of people walking

1712.4 --> 1718.01
into churches during during ceremonies

1715.79 --> 1719.81
or whatever and just saying yeah Christ

1718.01 --> 1721.51
was never born risers never work yeah

1719.81 --> 1724.1299999999999
that's kind of freaking trigger people

1721.51 --> 1726.32
eventually you know right they might be

1724.13 --> 1729.1100000000001
very solemn about it but they'll be

1726.32 --> 1730.61
freaking triggered okay so not telling

1729.11 --> 1733.8999999999999
anyone to do that by the way that's

1730.61 --> 1733.8999999999999
really rude and

1734.4 --> 1741.8300000000002
yeah if you're gonna tell aglow be a

1737.16 --> 1744.5700000000002
glow believer space religion

1741.83 --> 1746.46
fundamentalist is not all of them are

1744.57 --> 1750.6899999999998
fundamentalists of course only the ones

1746.46 --> 1754.1100000000001
that refuse to let go but yeah if you

1750.69 --> 1757.3500000000001
believe that all that and suddenly Flat

1754.11 --> 1761.49
Earth that's like almost like saying

1757.35 --> 1764.37
like yeah there Jesus was never born to

1761.49 --> 1768.11
a Christian because it's the foundation

1764.37 --> 1771.9289999999999
it's like it upholds the whole thing

1768.11 --> 1774.9599999999998
just like Christ upholds almost the

1771.929 --> 1780.71
entire Christianity he's at the core of

1774.96 --> 1783.929
it see yeah yeah that makes sense like

1780.71 --> 1785.55
they've been living for this this idea

1783.929 --> 1789.98
of their whole life once they realize

1785.55 --> 1795.45
that idea could possibly be not true

1789.98 --> 1799.64
then what have they been living for all

1795.45 --> 1802.5900000000001
right they've been dreaming about right

1799.64 --> 1806.51
so are so what you're saying is it's

1802.59 --> 1808.85
that impulse reaction that there haven't

1806.51 --> 1812.52
rights their dreams being crushed

1808.85 --> 1817.23
naturally dreams religion it's the same

1812.52 --> 1820.44
region it's the same focus being at rest

1817.23 --> 1821.9
mentally they're trusting you know

1820.44 --> 1827.73
feeling safe

1821.9 --> 1831.7900000000002
that's that sensation it's a condition

1827.73 --> 1835.059
it's yeah it is conditions is condition

1831.79 --> 1843.1499999999999
safe space in association is associated

1835.059 --> 1847.57
with dwelling upon certain data right I

1843.15 --> 1850.18
guess I've had a lot of time to you know

1847.57 --> 1853.1499999999999
obviously observe a lot of sunsets and

1850.18 --> 1856.23
it's it's 100 percent clear in my

1853.15 --> 1858.7
modeling that when I watch a sunset

1856.23 --> 1860.77
whatever that Sun is it's just moving

1858.7 --> 1868.8700000000001
away from me it's not a me rolling back

1860.77 --> 1873.1
on a ball you know yeah I've had I've

1868.87 --> 1876.79
had that I've had that time to not get

1873.1 --> 1880.99
triggered by what people say may be true

1876.79 --> 1882.52
may not be true I'll tell you a little

1880.99 --> 1884.74
story I think I might have told it

1882.52 --> 1889.48
before but I was seriously triggered

1884.74 --> 1892.42
like in 2014 when it was right before

1889.48 --> 1895.45
the whole flat before mark Sargent got

1892.42 --> 1898.3000000000002
on my radar but I had fallen asleep

1895.45 --> 1901.3300000000002
again it basically just broke up with my

1898.3 --> 1903.52
ex wasn't even like half a year before

1901.33 --> 1906.34
that so was still kind of in shock mode

1903.52 --> 1908.71
and I was thinking Space Station's I'm

1906.34 --> 1911.23
gonna designs video I always do that

1908.71 --> 1912.88
it's so annoying I hope it was like the

1911.23 --> 1914.8600000000001
first thing I start doing when I get

1912.88 --> 1921.5800000000002
amnesia there's a heightened Space

1914.86 --> 1923.83
Station's what yeah then I was basically

1921.58 --> 1926.6499999999999
had a new role-playing group not this

1923.83 --> 1928.51
group was different there were some

1926.65 --> 1933.16
people in there that had a little

1928.51 --> 1935.74
friction with one guy a lot and he was

1933.16 --> 1939.3300000000002
like kind of depressed and negative and

1935.74 --> 1945.429
he happened to look like amazingly alike

1939.33 --> 1948.04
the what is it the classic Russian Jesus

1945.429 --> 1952.0300000000002
icon type figure it just looked like it

1948.04 --> 1956.22
has like freaky but he was absolutely an

1952.03 --> 1959.8799999999999
atheist very much I think so yeah he was

1956.22 --> 1962.49
so but I talked about

1959.88 --> 1965.5
Space Station's this and that and he

1962.49 --> 1969.4
actually flat smacked me out of nowhere

1965.5 --> 1975.39
and I winged it and I say yeah of course

1969.4 --> 1978.429
I know that because I had forgotten

1975.39 --> 1980.38
completely even though like three years

1978.429 --> 1984.94
before that I was in the middle of that

1980.38 --> 1986.92
like I've had forgotten amnesia and then

1984.94 --> 1990.76
suddenly as he said it it all came back

1986.92 --> 1996.4
to me like instantly so yeah of course I

1990.76 --> 1999.28
know that [Â __Â ] it was bizarre but yeah

1996.4 --> 2001.89
he did that and I don't know if he was

1999.28 --> 2003.6
just trying to troll me that he had no

2001.89 --> 2007.95
idea what he was actually he was just

2003.6 --> 2010.9199999999998
trying to be me me mean with memes he

2007.95 --> 2015.44
was kind of a sadistic guy very good

2010.92 --> 2025.98
loved aspects but very smart and a

2015.44 --> 2028.97
creepy anyway I don't know you gotta

2025.98 --> 2032.04
feel bad for the Jews man I got a bad

2028.97 --> 2033.72
right right when I was talking about all

2032.04 --> 2036.87
that space [Â __Â ] and everything it was

2033.72 --> 2039.33
weird we didn't like talk about it after

2036.87 --> 2041.58
that I think I asked him again and he

2039.33 --> 2045.9289999999999
said no I was just trolling you but yeah

2041.58 --> 2049.429
he actually kind of triggered me to look

2045.929 --> 2052.44
it up again yeah weird

2049.429 --> 2055.29
they maybe he kind of put a moment of

2052.44 --> 2058.56
clarity in your head yeah he did but he

2055.29 --> 2062.669
didn't understand it basically right

2058.56 --> 2065.2799999999997
that I he just thought he was gonna be a

2062.669 --> 2067.379
troll because he didn't like how I was

2065.28 --> 2069.77
talking about space stations and [Â __Â ]

2067.379 --> 2069.77
and go

2070.1 --> 2079.47
yeah well uh I'm glad I don't know if he

2078.03 --> 2082.8300000000004
actually believed in it or not

2079.47 --> 2087.27
Oh our doctor I asked him afterwards and

2082.83 --> 2091.17
he said now was just trolling you so I

2087.27 --> 2094.86
don't know maybe he was just doing that

2091.17 --> 2099.66
I don't know it was very weird guy kind

2094.86 --> 2102.6600000000003
of bit of an artist well just closed off

2099.66 --> 2106.92
not sharing his feelings but do getting

2102.66 --> 2108.69
agitated yeah I don't know I hadn't

2106.92 --> 2111.0
known for that long in just a few months

2108.69 --> 2115.11
and then yeah we got in an argument

2111.0 --> 2121.64
online in it get got out of hand it's a

2115.11 --> 2121.6400000000003
web rage [Â __Â ] happens

2124.95 --> 2129.3289999999997
well then you get you sound like your

2127.859 --> 2132.569
spirits are up it sound like you're

2129.329 --> 2143.19
doing good yeah I'm doing good that's

2132.569 --> 2146.609
good sometimes it's uh it's it's so easy

2143.19 --> 2153.9900000000002
to just get to get down and mad you know

2146.609 --> 2157.2889999999998
but it's almost like it's it's getting

2153.99 --> 2159.4199999999996
mad and getting down it's I'd also bring

2157.289 --> 2163.5890000000004
myself down but it brings other people

2159.42 --> 2166.7400000000002
around me down you know you gotta learn

2163.589 --> 2170.279
how to defend yourself against it right

2166.74 --> 2173.9399999999996
and the the other day there was there

2170.279 --> 2177.029
was somebody at work yeah she she made a

2173.94 --> 2179.25
comment about me and it was I needed

2177.029 --> 2182.819
that I needed to hear her say this you

2179.25 --> 2190.14
know since you it's just kind of telling

2182.819 --> 2195.15
me how she really liked how I was what's

2190.14 --> 2198.72
the word is she is she kind of defined

2195.15 --> 2200.9100000000003
me as not not sporadic but kind of

2198.72 --> 2202.3489999999997
surprising because some of the stuff

2200.91 --> 2206.22
that I would say and the way that I

2202.349 --> 2210.2400000000002
would talk you know it would make her

2206.22 --> 2213.6899999999996
feel positive you know it was just

2210.24 --> 2217.529
something I need to hear because I felt

2213.69 --> 2219.089
like I felt like all this positive in

2217.529 --> 2221.789
Tim that I've been trying to cut out I

2219.089 --> 2225.93
felt like it wasn't paying off you know

2221.789 --> 2229.13
I know that selfish thinking's no don't

2225.93 --> 2234.98
be silly it's just not how it works you

2229.13 --> 2237.4100000000003
can't if you feel like [Â __Â ]

2234.98 --> 2240.53
you can't force yourself to be nice

2237.41 --> 2245.2599999999998
basically it's more important that you

2240.53 --> 2249.4100000000003
just don't let yourself get worse but as

2245.26 --> 2254.0600000000004
long as you just keep inside yourself

2249.41 --> 2258.8289999999997
that you want to do right but yeah the

2254.06 --> 2262.099
whole energy transfer thing really only

2258.829 --> 2264.2000000000003
works when you have energy when you're

2262.099 --> 2266.3900000000003
shining and then when you help it has a

2264.2 --> 2270.56
lot of influence it helps people a lot

2266.39 --> 2273.2599999999998
and you can often get some reward from

2270.56 --> 2275.69
God basically for doing it but if you're

2273.26 --> 2280.4900000000002
low on energy it just everything works

2275.69 --> 2282.92
differently and you can't risk like

2280.49 --> 2285.5
sacrificing yourself in the process of

2282.92 --> 2288.589
trying to be nice just to be nice you

2285.5 --> 2291.47
know just as long as you don't do bad

2288.589 --> 2295.849
things I don't know does that make any

2291.47 --> 2298.64
sense yeah that make sense it was it was

2295.849 --> 2300.26
just kind of a moment for me like maybe

2298.64 --> 2303.56
you've had this you know you've had a

2300.26 --> 2305.3590000000004
moment to where you kind of you kind of

2303.56 --> 2309.19
got some confirmation about something

2305.359 --> 2312.859
you know it was my little way of

2309.19 --> 2318.38
thinking okay so somebody is recognizing

2312.859 --> 2322.94
what I'm trying to do here that made me

2318.38 --> 2326.51
feel good absolutely to hear that people

2322.94 --> 2328.43
really understand not by just them

2326.51 --> 2331.0
saying it but by them actually

2328.43 --> 2333.5299999999997
confirming it to you by relaying it

2331.0 --> 2338.119
that's really rewarding that means

2333.53 --> 2340.579
somebody's listening well and being a

2338.119 --> 2344.4500000000003
being that it was a female that said to

2340.579 --> 2347.329
me know how females that females are

2344.45 --> 2351.29
able to read people really well I think

2347.329 --> 2354.53
I think men have that intuition too but

2351.29 --> 2359.72
I think females have it better they can

2354.53 --> 2362.21
read people you know maybe I'm talking a

2359.72 --> 2363.0899999999997
lot they'd seem to be better at it than

2362.21 --> 2366.52
men yeah

2363.09 --> 2369.58
it's mostly about the focus and yeah you

2366.52 --> 2373.3
could argue that they are chemically

2369.58 --> 2378.22
wise built to be more focused on that

2373.3 --> 2383.6200000000003
and thus no more detail it's another

2378.22 --> 2387.7
discussion if you do you ever come to

2383.62 --> 2397.15

have a talk or whatever but since your

2543.68 --> 2550.97
since you're on anyway thanks for adding

2548.37 --> 2550.97
me on skype

2561.799 --> 2567.72
alright okay somebody's gettin hard

2565.2 --> 2570.569
questions out Frank

2567.72 --> 2575.759
crits Mun asks are waitin what are your

2570.569 --> 2578.15
thoughts on gun control yeah well it

2575.759 --> 2578.15
sucks

2582.38 --> 2590.9100000000003
although yeah look there's so much

2588.109 --> 2595.68
surrounding the whole thing gun control

2590.91 --> 2598.14
and like yeah it's a cultural thing you

2595.68 --> 2603.6299999999997
need to have a good culture to be able

2598.14 --> 2605.8489999999997
to deal with it and yeah in the

2603.63 --> 2608.279
Netherlands and surrounding areas like

2605.849 --> 2612.7000000000003
they've cracked on the gun control so

2608.279 --> 2616.93
hard it's just gone it's just gone

2612.7 --> 2618.7599999999998
and yeah when everybody's used to no

2616.93 --> 2621.79
longer than being around they become

2618.76 --> 2628.21
boogeyman devices especially amplified

2621.79 --> 2630.13
in movies and everything so yeah

2628.21 --> 2632.7400000000002
everybody here if you see a gun yeah

2630.13 --> 2634.9300000000003
you're gonna be frightened automatically

2632.74 --> 2636.91
because unless it's the police and then

2634.93 --> 2637.4199999999996
it's probably also gonna make you

2636.91 --> 2640.69
nervous

2637.42 --> 2648.369
but that's another matter but yeah gun

2640.69 --> 2651.339
control it's it's stupid everybody

2648.369 --> 2658.15
should have the means to defend

2651.339 --> 2660.94
themselves properly and there should be

2658.15 --> 2663.19
definitely yeah just a really big code

2660.94 --> 2665.2000000000003
and important code of responsibility you

2663.19 --> 2668.23
know how to deal with it and I think

2665.2 --> 2672.46
there already is this stuff but I don't

2668.23 --> 2674.26
know it's Europe Netherlands is just

2672.46 --> 2676.089
completely different from the United

2674.26 --> 2678.5690000000004
States you can't really compare the two

2676.089 --> 2678.569
anymore

2680.809 --> 2686.19
but yeah the gun control happening over

2683.819 --> 2688.92
there it [Â __Â ] it has been [Â __Â ] for 10

2686.19 --> 2691.29
years at least maybe probably more

2688.92 --> 2693.7200000000003
they're always pushing and always trying

2691.29 --> 2696.77
to get it away and that's terrible

2693.72 --> 2698.7599999999998
it shouldn't happen it's very dangerous

2696.77 --> 2701.13
because I think that on average

2698.76 --> 2703.6800000000003
Americans are very responsible with

2701.13 --> 2705.69
their guns it's just

2703.68 --> 2708.54
yeah there's criminals that have them as

2705.69 --> 2710.96
well but yet they're gonna have them

2708.54 --> 2715.579
anyway and in the Netherlands yeah

2710.96 --> 2719.79
criminals some of them do have guns okay

2715.579 --> 2722.819
and some really some people that are

2719.79 --> 2724.89
just like yes crew that I am gonna

2722.819 --> 2727.89
defend myself properly no matter what

2724.89 --> 2731.2799999999997
the law says but I don't know that I've

2727.89 --> 2733.68
never bumped into one of those so you

2731.28 --> 2735.299
know how how many of those are there I

2733.68 --> 2738.089
don't really care as long as they don't

2735.299 --> 2740.549
commit crimes it's all fine you know I

2738.089 --> 2743.46
think people should be allowed to have

2740.549 --> 2748.079
that but the cultural implications are

2743.46 --> 2750.9
just very heavy and once the gun culture

2748.079 --> 2754.19
is gone it's super super tough to

2750.9 --> 2757.309
re-implement it maybe even impossible I

2754.19 --> 2757.309
don't know

2757.99 --> 2762.54
so but yeah I recommend against it

2763.91 --> 2768.94
that's my point that's my view on that

2777.46 --> 2785.68
so now we've got political gun control

2782.41 --> 2787.5099999999998
bad oh my god the words are deceptive

2785.68 --> 2794.77
you know you should have control over it

2787.51 --> 2796.809
but not like just the person wielding it

2794.77 --> 2800.41
should have a matter of control over

2796.809 --> 2805.78
themselves and follow a specific code of

2800.41 --> 2808.39
conduct but that's more personal

2805.78 --> 2811.9500000000003
cultural wise and yeah people that do

2808.39 --> 2814.7799999999997
use guns do apply that or they become

2811.95 --> 2816.8799999999997
like avoid it like okay these are

2814.78 --> 2818.6800000000003
dangerous people potential criminals or

2816.88 --> 2820.809
whatever that's I think how most people

2818.68 --> 2825.21
just deal with people that aren't very

2820.809 --> 2829.9
responsible with their guns I don't know

2825.21 --> 2832.839
I I'm just some Dutch guy live streaming

2829.9 --> 2834.819
in a room I am NOT the expert on this

2832.839 --> 2836.98
yet but from everything I've seen so far

2834.819 --> 2842.38
in the last 20 years yeah gun control

2836.98 --> 2844.36
bad always you know

2842.38 --> 2846.07
you deal with the criminal so they're

2844.36 --> 2851.26
likely to have guns anyway

2846.07 --> 2855.6400000000003
and leave citizens that are not

2851.26 --> 2856.15
criminals and their defense leave it

2855.64 --> 2860.41
alone

2856.15 --> 2867.13
that's how I would try to do it if I got

2860.41 --> 2872.52
the chance and and I don't like hunting

2867.13 --> 2872.52
really it's not my thing

2882.07 --> 2891.4300000000003
although in a way there is something to

2885.3 --> 2897.1600000000003
like wild hunted meat there is something

2891.43 --> 2899.83
special about it but yeah just shooting

2897.16 --> 2902.29
living things for the sport of it that's

2899.83 --> 2906.7799999999997
just disgusting in my opinion but if

2902.29 --> 2910.9
you're actually gonna hunt to eat yeah I

2906.78 --> 2912.82
don't know it seems like honorable yeah

2910.9 --> 2915.15
I guess you if you did it with a bow or

2912.82 --> 2918.31
anything would even be more honorable

2915.15 --> 2921.04
but I don't know that's just the thing

2918.31 --> 2922.66
that's been ingrained into me like if

2921.04 --> 2926.91
you're gonna kill something then at

2922.66 --> 2931.89
least eat it except if there you would I

2926.91 --> 2938.44
don't know just use it honor it by

2931.89 --> 2940.93
taking it in you or taking it with you I

2938.44 --> 2942.4
don't know is this like a really pagan

2940.93 --> 2944.35
thing or something I don't know what

2942.4 --> 2944.71
that is but that just how I feel about

2944.35 --> 2946.06
it

2944.71 --> 2949.92
if you're gonna hunt something then at

2946.06 --> 2949.92
least dignity to eat it

2953.21 --> 2958.03
what is that kind of question

2959.64 --> 2966.5
do you sign ISM what is that is that a

2964.2 --> 2966.5
question

2966.77 --> 2971.06
that seems kind of incomplete

2976.89 --> 2979.64
hmm

2980.56 --> 2989.08
right gaining wisdom son's skate wisdom

2985.0 --> 2991.24
is from Louisiana and yeah that sounds

2989.08 --> 2994.87
except what you're saying they're taught

2991.24 --> 2998.2299999999996
at a very young age and there's a good

2994.87 --> 3001.04
tool to protect and provide yeah that's

2998.23 --> 3004.85
a gun that's a proper gun culture that's

3001.04 --> 3004.85
really the way to go with it

3033.02 --> 3047.6
Oh do I support Zionism no I mostly like

3042.44 --> 3049.9700000000003
to stay out of it there's definite from

3047.6 --> 3057.14
what I've heard there's bad things about

3049.97 --> 3060.58
it but I am I'm satisfied to realize

3057.14 --> 3063.44
that I don't completely understand it

3060.58 --> 3065.869
and there may be things to it that are

3063.44 --> 3069.29
with hope yeah that I haven't learned

3065.869 --> 3072.13
yet or that may even be hidden from the

3069.29 --> 3074.5099999999998
general public about it so I don't know

3072.13 --> 3077.03
but from what I've heard it doesn't

3074.51 --> 3080.2400000000002
really sound too good and that's from

3077.03 --> 3083.8
even some time back not now because

3080.24 --> 3088.79
everybody see you did use the Jews

3083.8 --> 3091.79
because now yeah now bad is bad but even

3088.79 --> 3095.41
like ten years ago there was something

3091.79 --> 3100.25
about it Zionist and always kind of

3095.41 --> 3101.8999999999996
didn't feel really good but I don't I

3100.25 --> 3108.53
yeah I don't really have the full

3101.9 --> 3112.04
picture and I've seen some yeah like no

3108.53 --> 3118.13
more news that guy he's totally obsessed

3112.04 --> 3121.0299999999997
with Jews and Zionism and yeah I'm not

3118.13 --> 3123.8900000000003
gonna be like that ever

3121.03 --> 3128.51
but yeah there are things to learn about

3123.89 --> 3131.8399999999997
it yeah in the two kinds of Jews that's

3128.51 --> 3135.7400000000002
how you could say do the Christian type

3131.84 --> 3138.92
Jews and the the non-christian Jews

3135.74 --> 3142.7799999999997
which often can turn out to be Telmo

3138.92 --> 3142.78
Tian's as I say

3142.91 --> 3145.0589999999997
No

3153.049 --> 3156.579
that's just terrible youth

3183.91 --> 3190.73
yep

3186.05 --> 3194.38
it's interesting how they are

3190.73 --> 3199.7
technically classified in the same group

3194.38 --> 3202.06
well they seem so contradictory in a lot

3199.7 --> 3202.06
of things

3209.45 --> 3215.8999999999996
but I think that most people don't

3212.359 --> 3219.38
really realize that just like this is

3215.9 --> 3224.27
some pretty remote stuff but that just

3219.38 --> 3226.4900000000002
like yeah religious groups fragment

3224.27 --> 3231.46
groups like attacking one another within

3226.49 --> 3235.1299999999997
one religion could be mostly verbal or

3231.46 --> 3237.17
intellectual or even like yeah actually

3235.13 --> 3240.7000000000003
physical violence and terrorism against

3237.17 --> 3244.339
one another can go very far sometimes

3240.7 --> 3251.0589999999997
but I think that since the Jews are so

3244.339 --> 3253.16
freaking old I guess the religion is

3251.059 --> 3255.5890000000004
very old these books are very old they

3253.16 --> 3262.339
seem to be tied in with a lot of things

3255.589 --> 3264.8289999999997
as they are not change that it's very

3262.339 --> 3266.45
likely that these groups the separate

3264.829 --> 3269.809
branches probably did a lot of

3266.45 --> 3271.5789999999997
infighting right under our noses or

3269.809 --> 3273.7400000000002
maybe even like keeping it amongst

3271.579 --> 3275.569
themselves like not telling us that

3273.74 --> 3277.5989999999997
they're actually having a war with one

3275.569 --> 3277.599
another

3286.22 --> 3292.91
but anyway yeah that's what I think it's

3289.37 --> 3300.3199999999997
a big religion with a long time and when

3292.91 --> 3302.48
time passes things plate up and become

3300.32 --> 3304.94
in opposition to one another about

3302.48 --> 3307.16
elements is just always happens it's

3304.94 --> 3315.17
happened to Christianity in a very wide

3307.16 --> 3322.0099999999998
way as well so yeah it is all classified

3315.17 --> 3324.28
as all all the Jews and it's the same as

3322.01 --> 3329.1800000000003
to say it's like to all the Christians

3324.28 --> 3331.52
like really they're all and just just

3329.18 --> 3336.79
same it's all the same it's no

3331.52 --> 3340.88
differences whatsoever no background

3336.79 --> 3343.91
power struggles or anything no a war

3340.88 --> 3348.44
against one another over Christian

3343.91 --> 3353.87
principles nope not all the same no it's

3348.44 --> 3359.9900000000002
not and the same thing goes with yeah

3353.87 --> 3363.02
with the Jewish religions religion is a

3359.99 --> 3366.7999999999997
religion or religions seem so

3363.02 --> 3369.22
contrasting in certain aspects that even

3366.8 --> 3372.2000000000003
though they are woven from the same

3369.22 --> 3376.54
material they just are totally different

3372.2 --> 3376.54
worlds so is it really the same religion

3380.55 --> 3385.92
anyway that's kind of my superficial

3383.38 --> 3385.92
take on it

3399.99 --> 3405.0499999999997
you know letters data I think you're

3402.839 --> 3405.0499999999997
wrong

3408.63 --> 3416.29
artificial intelligence can damn well

3411.7 --> 3422.2799999999997
detect humor because it can understand

3416.29 --> 3422.2799999999997
it just through statistical analysis

3428.32 --> 3438.8500000000004
you can be assured that the AI has a

3432.31 --> 3441.61
very detailed knowledge on how besides

3438.85 --> 3444.31
behavioral aspects how it could

3441.61 --> 3447.6400000000003
interpret things frequency wise kind of

3444.31 --> 3450.34
the way that I do and then figure out

3447.64 --> 3453.75
this is funny because it's that

3450.34 --> 3459.31
frequency in this moment oh yeah

3453.75 --> 3460.27
it's AI it's giant it's like a hundred

3459.31 --> 3470.07
thousand Minds

3460.27 --> 3470.07
all one doesn't make them

3470.339 --> 3475.699
like who the creator but it just it

3473.099 --> 3478.2290000000003
means perfect oversight it means it can

3475.699 --> 3484.7690000000002
find order where we could only find

3478.229 --> 3487.609
chaos or at least be ahead of the curve

3484.769 --> 3487.609
in some way

3494.21 --> 3500.33
but yeah I don't know the entire set of

3497.27 --> 3502.67
off the AI and what its core programming

3500.33 --> 3505.25
is if it's just efficiency or if it is

3502.67 --> 3507.56
kind of human based because eventually

3505.25 --> 3510.62
it may be super super fast recognize

3507.56 --> 3512.84
things and be a perfect analyzer that

3510.62 --> 3517.1
doesn't mean that it actually knows what

3512.84 --> 3519.3500000000004
to do when it still has it might still

3517.1 --> 3521.62
be dependent on instructions I'm not

3519.35 --> 3521.62
sure

3541.16 --> 3549.3289999999997
hmm that's that may be true flatter data

3545.369 --> 3553.4700000000003
I think yeah from a super objective of

3549.329 --> 3556.7690000000002
stat standpoint it may definitely be

3553.47 --> 3560.279
difficult to distinguish between the

3556.769 --> 3563.7889999999998
different types of comedy and it might

3560.279 --> 3566.519
be seduced to just classified as one

3563.789 --> 3569.029
thing because pragmatically in arranging

3566.519 --> 3571.7099999999996
everything it works perfectly like that

3569.029 --> 3577.769
almost like accepting gravity because it

3571.71 --> 3579.66
works so well mathematically but yeah or

3577.769 --> 3583.22
maybe it does know the difference and it

3579.66 --> 3583.22
just doesn't really matter

3595.33 --> 3599.14
now I'm I'm more worried that some

3597.58 --> 3601.18
people apparently have trouble

3599.14 --> 3603.0099999999998
understanding and like people may have

3601.18 --> 3605.6699999999996
trouble understanding difference between

3603.01 --> 3605.67
satire and comedy

3623.92 --> 3629.01
right

3625.56 --> 3631.89
sure Oliver Varney love to hear more

3629.01 --> 3639.1200000000003
about that I've dealt with some people

3631.89 --> 3643.44
that are into AI and everything it's

3639.12 --> 3646.68
funny actually the game master that I

3643.44 --> 3650.16
played as a player with for the longest

3646.68 --> 3656.49
campaign like years ago he was an AI

3650.16 --> 3659.04
programmer for the Mars Lander yeah but

3656.49 --> 3661.2299999999996
yeah that thing had to work and he was

3659.04 --> 3663.33
programming it actually I think he would

3661.23 --> 3664.88
like was the one or at least part of the

3663.33 --> 3671.91
team that was doing that

3664.88 --> 3674.81
it's very proud about it didn't like

3671.91 --> 3674.81
creationism

3680.56 --> 3685.84
but yeah I have an idea and how it works

3683.16 --> 3687.52
heard a lot of people have heard a lot

3685.84 --> 3692.05
of programmers and everything talked

3687.52 --> 3696.55
about it among themselves as well but

3692.05 --> 3699.0600000000004
between a lot of programming programmer

3696.55 --> 3699.0600000000004
people

3713.539 --> 3721.13
anyway I think I'm gonna round out the

3715.849 --> 3731.119
show because the debates probably yeah

3721.13 --> 3734.149
they're starting so yeah uh it was kind

3731.119 --> 3736.849
of interesting hang out peanuts Clark

3734.149 --> 3740.899
and a lot of interactions with the chap

3736.849 --> 3742.909
your crazy questions and and good

3740.899 --> 3745.489
questions I think thank you for the good

3742.909 --> 3749.4390000000003
questions so thanks everyone for coming

3772.689 --> 3782.87
and yeah share the show so other people

3777.999 --> 3785.0299999999997
can also get to know me and yeah

3782.87 --> 3789.41
I do my thoughts about Flat Earth

3785.03 --> 3792.8500000000004
hashtag meifa of course absolutely I'm

3789.41 --> 3795.92
still thinking about getting that hats

doing that yeah it's gonna have to wait

3795.92 --> 3802.58
till a little later but that's also

3799.13 --> 3804.11
something that I'm gonna do I will be

3802.58 --> 3807.86
back tomorrow with Flat Earth

3804.11 --> 3810.11
early-bird number 124 I'm gonna be right

3807.86 --> 3814.46
after this on the debates fighters
