70.84 --> 77.759
right the weather today is

75.52 --> 77.759
i

79.04 --> 86.159
very different from yesterday

82.88 --> 87.36
i think it was from pretty much this

86.159 --> 92.0
entire night because

87.36 --> 94.479
last night pretty much until

92.0 --> 95.28
pretty deep in the morning it was just

94.479 --> 98.799
non-stop

95.28 --> 100.0
super super powerful storm i'm surprised

98.799 --> 102.24000000000001
there's not

100.0 --> 103.36
like more broken wrenches and [ __ ]

102.24 --> 107.03999999999999
everywhere

103.36 --> 108.85
because it was just storming so hard

107.04 --> 110.159
like literally

108.85 --> 112.83999999999999
[Music]

110.159 --> 114.799
the building at points would literally

112.84 --> 119.28
vibrate from the wind

114.799 --> 122.71900000000001
like super weird

119.28 --> 126.32000000000001
just hit this frequency sometimes

122.719 --> 129.44
it's like really heavy wind gusts

126.32 --> 131.92
a constant basis

129.44 --> 132.56
but now it's yeah it's almost all gone

131.92 --> 135.83999999999997
it's

132.56 --> 135.84
suddenly kind of still so

136.48 --> 140.72
yeah anyway i got green tea

140.8 --> 145.12
and i don't know for some of you

145.599 --> 152.79999999999998
it may seem like i'm starting

149.52 --> 157.84
a little bit late maybe

152.8 --> 157.84
or a little early which one is it

161.2 --> 166.07999999999998
now i it will probably seem like i'm

163.28 --> 169.519
starting a little bit early to some

166.08 --> 173.28
because certain clocks have

169.519 --> 176.959
switched an hour i was watching it

173.28 --> 180.4
last night and from 299 it clicked to

176.959 --> 183.04
two so it was like oh wait

180.4 --> 184.0
suddenly the time has changed but i'm

183.04 --> 187.2
adapting the show

184.0 --> 189.44
to that time so for some yeah

187.2 --> 195.83999999999997
technically i'm starting

189.44 --> 195.84
uh after 23 hours of the last show

196.84 --> 199.84
right

200.319 --> 203.92
started 602 what

204.4 --> 212.799
502 what

208.08 --> 215.36
i'm pretty sure it's 701 but anyway uh

212.799 --> 216.48000000000002
in chat so far is good servant who was

215.36 --> 219.59900000000002
first

216.48 --> 220.39999999999998
george sanford and agm good to see you

219.599 --> 223.83999999999997
all on this

220.4 --> 227.84
sunday show so far

223.84 --> 227.84
who to some may seem like it's a little

234.18 --> 237.3
[Music]

238.84 --> 241.84
early

242.48 --> 247.35999999999999
or am i technically starting a little

246.239 --> 250.959
early

247.36 --> 253.43900000000002
no wait yeah i should i think officially

250.959 --> 254.08
starting an hour later but i'm still

253.439 --> 256.0
starting

254.08 --> 257.12
at the same time so i'm incorrect i

256.0 --> 262.28
switched it all around

257.12 --> 266.08
god yeah because my clock is now saying

262.28 --> 267.84
13.06 well normally i start at 2pm

266.08 --> 270.15999999999997
but i'm starting at roughly the same

267.84 --> 270.15999999999997
time

270.24 --> 274.0
you're good in america because i can't i

272.72 --> 276.47900000000004
think that probably

274.0 --> 282.32
you haven't switched time yet over there

276.479 --> 285.44
in the u.s

282.32 --> 289.04
i think i will be starting

285.44 --> 291.52
back well what would be an hour later

289.04 --> 291.52000000000004
tomorrow

292.8 --> 297.84000000000003
no time change here right

301.84 --> 305.75899999999996
okay yeah i thought something like that

304.639 --> 309.36
and so not to be

305.759 --> 312.16
all confusing to everyone and since

309.36 --> 313.44
flat earth debates is not live today i'm

312.16 --> 316.0
starting just

313.44 --> 318.0
well what would be according to the my

316.0 --> 320.32
clock an hour earlier

318.0 --> 321.12
but to most most other people it would

320.32 --> 325.36
be starting

321.12 --> 328.56
just the normal time

325.36 --> 330.16
and i yeah tomorrow i will start an hour

328.56 --> 333.52
later so

330.16 --> 333.52000000000004
to give everybody a heads up

333.919 --> 341.75899999999996
right oh man i don't know what happened

339.52 --> 343.75899999999996
but i got like this really annoying

341.759 --> 345.52000000000004
cramp

343.759 --> 348.0
on this side of my shoulder all of a

345.52 --> 350.08
sudden maybe i was exposed to the wind a

348.0 --> 353.84
little bit too much

350.08 --> 353.84
it's really annoying

355.6 --> 359.199
all right eu members

364.84 --> 380.56
okay

366.4 --> 385.039
all right that's good to know

380.56 --> 385.039
man it's just

385.68 --> 390.16
i hope that goes away because yeah this

387.759 --> 391.36
sort of thing is really annoying it gets

390.16 --> 394.40000000000003
me into all cram

391.36 --> 398.319
types of situations

394.4 --> 398.31899999999996
i'll have to work on that after the show

399.919 --> 406.08
right um let's see what i was doing

406.84 --> 411.44
yesterday

408.16 --> 414.16
saturday as i thought ball busters

411.44 --> 414.16
wasn't live

414.96 --> 419.52
just a premiere i didn't see it really i

417.52 --> 423.84
think it was an older show

419.52 --> 423.84
uh restream or something that qe did

424.96 --> 431.599
right but uh yeah owen benjamin was live

428.56 --> 431.599
and that was pretty awesome

431.68 --> 438.40000000000003
i said yeah

434.72 --> 442.72
showing some red pill roosters

438.4 --> 442.71999999999997
newer videos that was pretty cool

444.24 --> 453.039
oh man

450.72 --> 455.52000000000004
that my youtube keeps stalling i don't

453.039 --> 455.52
know why

461.68 --> 467.759
it just yeah although

465.199 --> 468.479
yeah it doesn't really show in the

467.759 --> 470.24
recording

468.479 --> 473.68
so i shouldn't even address it it's just

470.24 --> 473.68
a little nuisance to myself

475.68 --> 479.84000000000003
chat is still flowing right

480.4 --> 483.35999999999996
oh benjamin

483.599 --> 487.12
well there wasn't really a lot of

485.199 --> 490.08000000000004
streams

487.12 --> 492.16
they were really super noteworthy oh

490.08 --> 494.24
yeah it was a little

492.16 --> 496.24
little flat earth folker who went i

494.24 --> 500.319
think to the

496.24 --> 503.199
flat tober fest and handed

500.319 --> 504.24
oreo cookies to mark sardian and it was

503.199 --> 507.199
part of some

504.24 --> 508.639
joke set up but apparently there was a

507.199 --> 510.72
miscommunication anyway

508.639 --> 512.08
yeah nothing super special like that

510.72 --> 513.839
just

512.08 --> 515.9190000000001
kind of a random stream but it was funny

513.839 --> 518.719
to have a look in there

515.919 --> 520.159
in a flat overfest uh right other than

518.719 --> 522.6400000000001
that i don't really remember

520.159 --> 522.64
anything

526.16 --> 529.68
very special nah

529.839 --> 536.5600000000001
oh right wait yeah yeah david weiss

534.08 --> 537.12
had a little video that was kind of

536.56 --> 540.3199999999999
weird

537.12 --> 544.0
anybody see that matthew

540.32 --> 544.0
mcconaughey mcconaughey

544.72 --> 550.88
sort of kind of in between

548.48 --> 552.16
sentences i guess came out for flat

550.88 --> 555.8389999999999
earth

552.16 --> 555.8389999999999
but i think it was really like

555.92 --> 559.279
like an unofficial

559.36 --> 562.64
like he was basically sort of

561.76 --> 565.8389999999999
information

562.64 --> 568.72
signaling the flat earth i think

565.839 --> 571.6800000000001
so but it was still interesting to see

568.72 --> 577.839
and i really do like him as an actor so

571.68 --> 577.8389999999999
it's pretty cool to see that

582.48 --> 591.839
anybody see that

602.0 --> 605.839
mike williams presentation

606.0 --> 608.959
i didn't see that

610.32 --> 618.88
i don't know who is that mike williams

614.16 --> 622.1
that youtuber

618.88 --> 622.1
[Music]

624.21 --> 628.379
[Music]

651.36 --> 655.519
i don't know if i got the right mike

664.959 --> 668.8
and there's a picture of two guys

670.24 --> 675.839

672.959 --> 675.8389999999999
home page

677.12 --> 680.16

682.079 --> 688.0799999999999

688.08 --> 692.359
[Music]

look up sage of quay okay all right

719.26 --> 723.76
[Music]

720.88 --> 724.639
i do know him he's been around for a

723.76 --> 726.8
long time

724.639 --> 731.839
i've watched his videos like even before

726.8 --> 731.8389999999999
flat earth

740.0 --> 746.72
but i know his his youtube

743.68 --> 750.2399999999999
page last videos

746.72 --> 753.6
last video was four days ago so i

750.24 --> 755.76
i don't know exactly what you are

753.6 --> 759.839
talking about their forever conscious

755.76 --> 759.8389999999999
research channel

767.68 --> 774.079
oh wait mike williams

771.2 --> 777.279
is on that video so it was but that's

774.079 --> 777.279
four days ago is that

781.839 --> 788.72
but yeah anyway i it was good i guess

786.24 --> 789.6800000000001
i'm talking about his presentation at

788.72 --> 791.9200000000001
plateau prophet

789.68 --> 791.92
what

794.16 --> 801.1999999999999
but is like is this even a flat earth

798.839 --> 815.839
channel

801.2 --> 815.839
is this ad flat over first

818.399 --> 821.36
i don't think so

827.12 --> 832.149
all right right

829.1 --> 832.149
[Music]

837.519 --> 843.36
i vaguely remember it it's been such a

839.92 --> 845.76
long time but i think that he did have

843.36 --> 846.88
some some more open discussions about

845.76 --> 850.48
flat earth

846.88 --> 853.68
if i remember correctly but it's been a

850.48 --> 853.6800000000001
long time ago so

853.92 --> 857.8389999999999
yeah five or so flat earth interviews

856.0 --> 860.24
yeah yeah i guess my memory is sort of

857.839 --> 860.24
correct

867.36 --> 871.839
oh man

883.68 --> 890.88
[Music]

898.44 --> 913.839
[Music]

899.6 --> 913.839
right anyway

920.079 --> 926.88
yeah pretty much other than that

923.12 --> 929.36
didn't really yeah we just want

926.88 --> 932.32
watched a bunch of videos that are yeah

929.36 --> 935.6
not super interesting older videos uh

932.32 --> 937.44
not flat earth related uh i did take

935.6 --> 939.0400000000001
notice that there's a lot of reviews

937.44 --> 941.12
going around now

939.04 --> 942.3199999999999
apparently because that's typically what

941.12 --> 944.8
these people do

942.32 --> 947.44
these movie reviewers and such a new

944.8 --> 950.3199999999999
movie goes out comes out

947.44 --> 952.0790000000001
then they they grab back at older

950.32 --> 953.36
versions because a lot of movies are

952.079 --> 956.4799999999999
remakes

953.36 --> 959.6
older versions review that and then

956.48 --> 960.5600000000001
like do like it they watch the movie and

959.6 --> 964.399
talk about it

960.56 --> 966.16
type of review because usually they

964.399 --> 968.24
can't really show footage other than

966.16 --> 970.0
from trailers

968.24 --> 972.0
cooper right strike because it's usually

970.0 --> 974.959
still in theaters but yeah there was a

972.0 --> 977.199
there's apparently this the witch's

974.959 --> 980.079
movie a remake

977.199 --> 980.399
from a roald dahl movie and the older

980.079 --> 982.16
one

980.399 --> 984.399
yeah that's that's weird because the

982.16 --> 987.12
other one i saw that with my parents

984.399 --> 988.48
in the movies in theater and it was very

987.12 --> 992.8
young

988.48 --> 992.8000000000001
and that movie scared the [ __ ] out of me

993.36 --> 996.639
it like it was silly too but it also

996.24 --> 1001.199
just

996.639 --> 1005.6800000000001
really it's just freaky

1001.199 --> 1009.199
that movie but the new one is

1005.68 --> 1011.199
it's just like ugh and yeah there's a

1009.199 --> 1013.04
lot of reviews about it

1011.199 --> 1014.8
like that comparing it to the other one

1013.04 --> 1018.3199999999999
and the older one

1014.8 --> 1021.3599999999999
has more convincing acting in it

1018.32 --> 1023.1990000000001
and like a lot of practical effects a

1021.36 --> 1026.72
lot of masks and [ __ ] that are

1023.199 --> 1029.9189999999999
really detailed and freaky and they

1026.72 --> 1032.559
didn't have any of that in here

1029.919 --> 1033.679
it was all just a bunch of cdi and it's

1032.559 --> 1037.28
more demonic

1033.679 --> 1041.3600000000001
and not really well what we

1037.28 --> 1041.36
associate with old-fashioned

1041.52 --> 1045.36
like the old myths of witches on

1043.839 --> 1048.24
broomsticks and [ __ ]

1045.36 --> 1051.039
which the first one definitely did play

1048.24 --> 1054.72
into much more

1051.039 --> 1054.72
and yeah so that's going around

1055.28 --> 1062.559
movies like sports nonsense

1058.32 --> 1062.559
to keep your mind astray right

1064.72 --> 1067.84
nothing is captivating and original

1067.36 --> 1071.6
anymore

1067.84 --> 1071.6
yet that's the problem it's like

1072.48 --> 1076.16
the movie makers are just

1077.36 --> 1084.08
they think too much of all the cgi

1081.6 --> 1085.4399999999998
and they think they can just make things

1084.08 --> 1089.76
cheaper

1085.44 --> 1089.76
by replacing it with cgi but that

1090.08 --> 1093.6789999999999
it's been like yeah they've been trying

1092.64 --> 1096.16
that for

1093.679 --> 1097.919
for over a decade now and they should

1096.16 --> 1101.3600000000001
know better than that

1097.919 --> 1104.48
pp people do review

1101.36 --> 1105.12
the movies give commentary and a lot of

1104.48 --> 1108.16
them are

1105.12 --> 1110.7199999999998
very extensive you know like

1108.16 --> 1113.3600000000001
in the last century yeah there were some

1110.72 --> 1114.559
reviewers even on television and stuff

1113.36 --> 1117.4399999999998
and

1114.559 --> 1118.32
radio maybe and yeah that was pretty

1117.44 --> 1122.0800000000002
rare but now

1118.32 --> 1125.36
with the internet it's just there's

1122.08 --> 1128.72
thousands and thousands and thousands

1125.36 --> 1130.6399999999999
of movie reviewers that are

1128.72 --> 1131.84
trying to be serious and some of them

1130.64 --> 1133.76
are really good

1131.84 --> 1135.039
are like into the movie business

1133.76 --> 1138.4
themselves

1135.039 --> 1141.679
they do it themselves and

1138.4 --> 1145.76
right so there's just

1141.679 --> 1149.039
a lot better information reflection

1145.76 --> 1150.8799999999999
for all of it out there but yet it seems

1149.039 --> 1151.76
like all the hollywood directors and all

1150.88 --> 1153.5200000000002
that

1151.76 --> 1154.96
they're just doing their own thing and

1153.52 --> 1159.679
they're just being

1154.96 --> 1161.6000000000001
stubborn because every time this happens

1159.679 --> 1162.799
they make they kind of end up making the

1161.6 --> 1165.84
same type of mistakes

1162.799 --> 1165.84
too much cgi

1166.08 --> 1173.6789999999999
and yeah it doesn't really improve

1169.919 --> 1176.88
things cgi should always ever be

1173.679 --> 1180.0800000000002
like to connect

1176.88 --> 1182.72
other things you know cgi should not be

1180.08 --> 1186.0
like oh look at the cgi i got oh

1182.72 --> 1189.6000000000001
so special so spooky or whatever that's

1186.0 --> 1193.6
usually it it usually always sucks

1189.6 --> 1196.559
you know compared to practical effects

1193.6 --> 1198.1599999999999
it should be it shouldn't be really used

1196.559 --> 1200.24
for that i try to explain this many

1198.16 --> 1203.039
times before i think

1200.24 --> 1203.76
it should be used in the quick in

1203.039 --> 1207.2
between

1203.76 --> 1209.12
scenes when

1207.2 --> 1211.52
when you don't really pick it up that

1209.12 --> 1214.6399999999999
much but it's there to basically

1211.52 --> 1217.679
fill in with trickery

1214.64 --> 1220.72
the mind so that it just seems real

1217.679 --> 1223.2
that's the way cgi should be used

1220.72 --> 1224.96
and yeah there are movie makers that do

1223.2 --> 1226.64
use it just like that sometimes you

1224.96 --> 1229.919
don't even know when they use it

1226.64 --> 1230.72
now that's good cgi right it's in

1229.919 --> 1232.72
between

1230.72 --> 1234.08
but still there's plenty out there that

1232.72 --> 1236.88
are just using it like oh

1234.08 --> 1238.96
look at the special cgi oh it's so

1236.88 --> 1240.3200000000002
special and me people are just like oh

1238.96 --> 1243.44
my god

1240.32 --> 1243.4399999999998
it's stupid

1243.52 --> 1246.08
a lot of them

1246.88 --> 1251.2800000000002
yeah and this one the new witches is

1249.44 --> 1254.48
typically

1251.28 --> 1255.36
falls into that category the stupid

1254.48 --> 1263.84
mouth cj

1255.36 --> 1263.84
it's just ridiculous

1270.32 --> 1274.799
you know like if you do that sort of

1272.48 --> 1277.28
[ __ ]

1274.799 --> 1281.36
then you should do it so sparingly that

1277.28 --> 1284.559
it's really shocking and unexpected

1281.36 --> 1284.559
but they didn't use that

1284.96 --> 1289.039
they just were constantly flashing with

1287.2 --> 1291.76
it and it's just super dumb

1289.039 --> 1293.6
it's just annoying attention grab your

1291.76 --> 1296.1589999999999
look at the cgi oh

1293.6 --> 1298.559
so special that's what you get when you

1296.159 --> 1300.24
do that

1298.559 --> 1301.6789999999999
and they just should have left it for

1300.24 --> 1304.96
shock moments

1301.679 --> 1306.96
to like like have

1304.96 --> 1308.24
well more in the direction of a jump

1306.96 --> 1311.6000000000001
scare but not

1308.24 --> 1313.76
yeah not like that but just let it be

1311.6 --> 1315.76
very unexpected you know and then it's

1313.76 --> 1318.4
like

1315.76 --> 1319.44
it's like whoa what the [ __ ] is this now

1318.4 --> 1321.6000000000001
that's scary

1319.44 --> 1323.76
but if you just show it off right away

1321.6 --> 1324.7199999999998
and like every time they get angry they

1323.76 --> 1327.76
show their

1324.72 --> 1332.24
special cgi face that's just

1327.76 --> 1334.8799999999999
stupid this is uh

1332.24 --> 1334.88
but anyway

1335.679 --> 1339.76
yeah lego movies was another reason one

1338.08 --> 1342.559
that i saw loads of truth

1339.76 --> 1344.64
yeah lego movies are are pretty popular

1342.559 --> 1347.2
even

1344.64 --> 1348.72
and especially some of the earlier ones

1347.2 --> 1351.5
apparently are really good

1348.72 --> 1353.3600000000001
with an interesting new

1351.5 --> 1358.4
[Music]

1353.36 --> 1361.4399999999998
like a new framework

1358.4 --> 1364.88
for doing things in a movie new ways of

1361.44 --> 1364.88
joking around and

1364.96 --> 1368.799
so that it the movie very much almost

1367.2 --> 1372.0
becomes like

1368.799 --> 1374.559
somebody's playing with toys and then

1372.0 --> 1377.52
the toys reflect the way kind of the

1374.559 --> 1378.799
the person is thinking about it playing

1377.52 --> 1380.8799999999999
with it

1378.799 --> 1383.12
and yeah that was very successful when

1380.88 --> 1384.5590000000002
they tried that in a lot of new movies

1383.12 --> 1387.039
try that

1384.559 --> 1388.799
try to be like that of course as they

1387.039 --> 1391.36
always do with something that's just

1388.799 --> 1394.6399999999999
unexpectedly successful

1391.36 --> 1398.0
but yeah lego movies was pretty good i

1394.64 --> 1400.88
i've never seen it but i've just

1398.0 --> 1402.799
heard a lot of praise about it from

1400.88 --> 1404.0800000000002
people that i do kind of respect for

1402.799 --> 1407.679
their

1404.08 --> 1409.9189999999999
movie opinions

1407.679 --> 1409.919
so

1413.6 --> 1417.84
as for the load of truths i don't know

1415.6 --> 1419.76
about that probably that that wouldn't

1417.84 --> 1421.9189999999999
be surprising that that's in there as

1419.76 --> 1421.919
well

1423.44 --> 1431.8400000000001
hello by the way iron effie jeff rabborg

1441.52 --> 1447.6
hmm yeah westworld

1444.64 --> 1450.7990000000002
indeed yeah westworld is a really good

1447.6 --> 1450.799
reflection of just

1451.84 --> 1458.1589999999999
of a certain type of mindset

1455.12 --> 1458.7199999999998
that certain elitists are engaging in

1458.159 --> 1460.96
and it's

1458.72 --> 1460.96
just

1462.159 --> 1465.5200000000002
very transhuman

1465.6 --> 1469.12
and very revealing edit

1470.24 --> 1474.24
uh yeah i watched that the yeah that the

1472.799 --> 1477.36
remake series

1474.24 --> 1477.76
uh for sec up until the second season i

1477.36 --> 1479.36
think

1477.76 --> 1481.919
i don't know if there's a new season or

1479.36 --> 1487.84
anything but it the series did really

1481.919 --> 1487.8400000000001
impress me

1488.24 --> 1491.6
in contrast to the older movie which i

1490.48 --> 1494.72
thought was just

1491.6 --> 1495.9189999999999
boring as [ __ ] but that's because it was

1494.72 --> 1498.32
just old

1495.919 --> 1498.3200000000002
and i

1499.12 --> 1503.4399999999998
i didn't like the atmosphere at all in

1501.36 --> 1503.4399999999998
it

1503.46 --> 1506.609
[Music]

1507.84 --> 1515.9189999999999
the 1940s had good movies really

1511.84 --> 1517.12
like what ambol what's a good movie in

1515.919 --> 1520.96
the 1940s i

1517.12 --> 1520.9599999999998
i couldn't think of one at the top of my

1526.84 --> 1529.84
mind

1540.84 --> 1543.84
oh

1550.559 --> 1554.1589999999999
who are you addressing by the way who's

1554.84 --> 1557.84
wrong

1561.279 --> 1567.12
oh said iron fe

1564.72 --> 1571.84
are you called wrong i i never thought

1567.12 --> 1571.84
of that

1574.559 --> 1579.289
okay

1576.2 --> 1579.289
[Music]

1581.039 --> 1585.84
all right it was hidden in plain sight

1582.48 --> 1585.84
all that time

1586.38 --> 1589.8190000000002
[Music]

1591.76 --> 1599.84
ronald okay cool

1601.98 --> 1607.2
[Music]

1604.559 --> 1607.2
oh man

1607.84 --> 1615.9189999999999
so anything else did that happen

1612.799 --> 1618.72
i'm being i've been yeah

1615.919 --> 1619.3600000000001
at a short distance basically keeping

1618.72 --> 1622.88
track of

1619.36 --> 1625.36
dutch situations on or not on the news

1622.88 --> 1629.3600000000001
but through my alternative

1625.36 --> 1631.6
website that i like because of

1629.36 --> 1632.559
just the the type of articles they put

1631.6 --> 1635.6
out

1632.559 --> 1636.32
usually linking a lot to others but

1635.6 --> 1639.9189999999999
apparently

1636.32 --> 1640.399
like we're about to go into some kind of

1639.919 --> 1643.2
move

1640.399 --> 1645.76
by our government to really pull off

1643.2 --> 1647.919
lockdown situation and like the

1645.76 --> 1649.52
there's a lot of friction and a lot of

1647.919 --> 1652.8400000000001
people speaking out against

1649.52 --> 1655.52
it like even in the government and

1652.84 --> 1657.6
everywhere

1655.52 --> 1660.08
some are saying that like this week

1657.6 --> 1661.1999999999998
they're it's they're basically gonna do

1660.08 --> 1664.559
that apparently i

1661.2 --> 1669.44
i don't even know i i haven't kept track

1664.559 --> 1672.96
too much

1669.44 --> 1674.72
but yeah i guess i'll find out soon

1672.96 --> 1676.08
enough what this freaking lockdown is

1674.72 --> 1677.84
supposed to be meaning

1676.08 --> 1679.1999999999998
i don't even know if it really applies

1677.84 --> 1681.039
to this city

1679.2 --> 1683.2
it might be that it it's only going to

1681.039 --> 1686.1589999999999
apply to rotterdam or then hey or

1683.2 --> 1689.039
something i don't know

1686.159 --> 1690.24
i should probably know but unfortunately

1689.039 --> 1692.72
uh yeah

1690.24 --> 1695.2
i'm not too enthusiastic to really dig

1692.72 --> 1698.799
into that sort of subject too much

1695.2 --> 1702.96
never really have but yeah it's become

1698.799 --> 1702.96
prominent enough that i probably should

1703.36 --> 1711.84
anybody else know something about that

1706.64 --> 1711.8400000000001
in the netherlands

1722.96 --> 1727.6000000000001
yeah yeah i know that they've also said

1726.08 --> 1729.9189999999999
that

1727.6 --> 1731.279
so i wonder what it will be will it be a

1729.919 --> 1733.5200000000002
pure bluff situation

1731.279 --> 1735.36
if they're gonna follow through on this

1733.52 --> 1739.84
or is it just effectively going to be

1735.36 --> 1739.84
negated i don't know

1742.799 --> 1747.84
the maltese falcon never heard of that

1750.84 --> 1755.36
emblem

1752.88 --> 1755.3600000000001
fungus

1756.72 --> 1767.84
okay in that case it better stop

1760.159 --> 1767.8400000000001
eating sugar i guess

1780.48 --> 1783.52
oh casablanca yeah yeah i do know that

1783.12 --> 1785.36
one

1783.52 --> 1788.0
in the sense that the name yeah that's a

1785.36 --> 1789.84
very famous movie i didn't know

1788.0 --> 1794.72
from what the air ride was but i guess

1789.84 --> 1797.12
from the 40s

1794.72 --> 1799.039
but that's a very famous movie i might

1797.12 --> 1799.6789999999999
have seen it once but that's been a long

1799.039 --> 1803.76
time ago

1799.679 --> 1803.76
then i don't remember anything about it

1806.84 --> 1809.84
huh

1812.72 --> 1823.84
the impact what

1834.399 --> 1837.84
all right

1839.07 --> 1842.1699999999998
[Music]

1845.279 --> 1851.84
hey ordinary bear good morning

1862.84 --> 1865.84
so

1876.84 --> 1879.84
hmm

1886.96 --> 1891.679
medical profession in the same campus

1889.2 --> 1891.679
nasa

1891.76 --> 1899.2
well that's

1896.08 --> 1903.36
yeah that's what i've done

1899.2 --> 1905.039
even before nasa in ways

1903.36 --> 1907.6789999999999
because i've already had pretty bad

1905.039 --> 1911.279
experiences with doctors

1907.679 --> 1913.039
plenty and the last doctor that i've

1911.279 --> 1917.519
even been to

1913.039 --> 1921.36
i was just very defensive

1917.519 --> 1923.2
already because yeah i

1921.36 --> 1925.84
remember i didn't know it's been a long

1923.2 --> 1928.64
time ago like over two years but

1925.84 --> 1929.4399999999998
i had an issue when i was really sick

1928.64 --> 1932.3990000000001
like

1929.44 --> 1934.799
had basically a mental breakdown or well

1932.399 --> 1936.799
physical physiological breakdown my mind

1934.799 --> 1939.519
was still clear

1936.799 --> 1941.2
tried to go to doctor like help can you

1939.519 --> 1944.0
drooling on the floor and all that [ __ ]

1941.2 --> 1944.32
but it's a long time ago it's pretty

1944.0 --> 1947.519
much

1944.32 --> 1948.0
acute response to just my life radically

1947.519 --> 1949.76
changing

1948.0 --> 1951.2
after having been dumped by what i

1949.76 --> 1952.08
thought was the love of my life and all

1951.2 --> 1955.6000000000001
that

1952.08 --> 1957.9189999999999
sort of it was all dramatic

1955.6 --> 1958.8799999999999
but i went there basically saying okay i

1957.919 --> 1962.0
need something to

1958.88 --> 1964.7990000000002
basic acutely help stop the nausea

1962.0 --> 1967.44
in the moment that's all i need and he

1964.799 --> 1970.559
forwarded me

1967.44 --> 1974.559
to yeah

1970.559 --> 1977.6789999999999
like an institution that kind of helps

1974.559 --> 1978.96
people and yeah like that i guess well

1977.679 --> 1980.88
guess what they did

1978.96 --> 1982.88
they put me in a waiting room for a

1980.88 --> 1987.7600000000002
while then just

1982.88 --> 1987.7600000000002
talked to me and couldn't really help me

1988.559 --> 1995.12
like they gave me just a couple of basic

1992.399 --> 1995.9189999999999
pills because i asked for it it took

1995.12 --> 1998.0
very long

1995.919 --> 2000.48
and they were probing it was very

1998.0 --> 2002.96
annoying not super helpful

2000.48 --> 2005.84
and then afterwards they sent me a giant

2002.96 --> 2005.8400000000001
giant bill

2005.919 --> 2009.279
when all i needed was like help i need

2008.799 --> 2012.72
this

2009.279 --> 2014.48
specific thing

2012.72 --> 2016.559
that's all i need i don't need any

2014.48 --> 2017.6
advice i don't need anything i just need

2016.559 --> 2019.519
that and they

2017.6 --> 2022.32
that cost they sent me like a bill of

2019.519 --> 2025.919
like 500 euros for that

2022.32 --> 2029.4399999999998
the total ripoff it was furious

2025.919 --> 2030.88
furious because yeah i had huge money

2029.44 --> 2033.6000000000001
problems that was pretty much

2030.88 --> 2034.64
part of the cause of that entire mental

2033.6 --> 2037.039
situation

2034.64 --> 2038.24
because of just the overkill amounts of

2037.039 --> 2040.64
stress

2038.24 --> 2041.919
and then getting a bit like that is just

2040.64 --> 2047.8400000000001
i hate

2041.919 --> 2047.8400000000001
the medical system i hate it

2048.24 --> 2052.0
it just felt like a giant freaking

2050.56 --> 2055.679
bureaucracy to me

2052.0 --> 2058.32
trying to rip me off it didn't help me

2055.679 --> 2059.679
it's like you have to be healthy in

2058.32 --> 2061.3590000000004
order to get through that

2059.679 --> 2063.839
without being ripped off because when

2061.359 --> 2066.5989999999997
you're actually sick and you go to them

2063.839 --> 2068.72
they'll screw you over for your

2066.599 --> 2070.8
incapability of dealing said this

2068.72 --> 2072.56
with the situation they do that those

2070.8 --> 2076.8790000000004
freaking maniacs

2072.56 --> 2082.0099999999998
it's disgusting disgusting they abuse

2076.879 --> 2087.679
the vulnerable that's what i experienced

2082.01 --> 2089.44
[Music]

2087.679 --> 2093.2000000000003
now i'm not saying that that happens to

2089.44 --> 2096.159
everybody but it happened to me

2093.2 --> 2097.1189999999997
they don't just help you if you

2096.159 --> 2100.8
represent

2097.119 --> 2102.96
yourself and say i need a very specific

2100.8 --> 2104.5600000000004
something they don't do that they just

2102.96 --> 2108.64
don't help you

2104.56 --> 2109.839
it's disgusting so the next time i'll

2108.64 --> 2113.2
just try and go to

2109.839 --> 2115.2
to a pharmacist if i needed that

2113.2 --> 2116.56
yeah acute anti-nausea type of

2115.2 --> 2118.48
medication

2116.56 --> 2120.56
i'll just go there and just ask like i

2118.48 --> 2124.079
need something i'll pay i don't care

2120.56 --> 2126.56
because i'd rather pay like i don't know

2124.079 --> 2129.119
like 50 euros for a couple of pills even

2126.56 --> 2132.16
though that would be extremely excessive

2129.119 --> 2133.8
then being pointed at somebody else put

2132.16 --> 2136.96
in a waiting room then build

2133.8 --> 2141.3590000000004
500 freaking euros

2136.96 --> 2141.359
it's insane you know

2142.4 --> 2148.78
so yeah

2145.57 --> 2148.78
[Music]

2150.079 --> 2155.3590000000004
also i used to have because i yeah i had

2153.28 --> 2156.48
medical problems with my ears when i was

2155.359 --> 2159.2
born

2156.48 --> 2160.8
like or when i was a baby i had serious

2159.2 --> 2163.9199999999996
ear infections

2160.8 --> 2166.0
double-sided it was very annoying

2163.92 --> 2168.079
yeah even dangerous they thought back

2166.0 --> 2170.24
then

2168.079 --> 2172.32
had a pretty high fever and all that and

2170.24 --> 2175.359
i've had some ear problems thank

2172.32 --> 2178.2400000000002
god not my hearing itself my hearing is

2175.359 --> 2179.359
excellent it's just that there's a lot

2178.24 --> 2183.4399999999996
of

2179.359 --> 2186.88
agitation there like

2183.44 --> 2189.44
the ear tubes and all that in my ears

2186.88 --> 2190.88
and i went to a doctor for that one time

2189.44 --> 2193.44
i think i was like in my

2190.88 --> 2194.32
lady in my teens and they gave me like

2193.44 --> 2196.8
this stuff

2194.32 --> 2198.4
that supposedly would help against it

2196.8 --> 2199.44
presuming that it was some kind of

2198.4 --> 2202.7200000000003
fungus

2199.44 --> 2204.8
but it wasn't it wasn't

2202.72 --> 2205.7599999999998
i was just desperate to get rid of it

2204.8 --> 2209.28
and he just

2205.76 --> 2210.48
gave me something to basic like but that

2209.28 --> 2214.88
stuff

2210.48 --> 2217.359
actually made it worse a lot worse

2214.88 --> 2218.079
so i immediately stopped it like after

2217.359 --> 2220.48
one

2218.079 --> 2222.1600000000003
or two tries because it like became

2220.48 --> 2224.88
painful and [ __ ]

2222.16 --> 2227.2799999999997
so they yeah they basically made me drop

2224.88 --> 2229.359
some weird chemical in my ear that was

2227.28 --> 2232.32
not helping at all

2229.359 --> 2234.0
terrible and so i don't have any really

2232.32 --> 2236.7200000000003
good experiences with doctors

2234.0 --> 2239.44
ever like that every time i went to them

2236.72 --> 2239.4399999999996
for something

2239.76 --> 2245.92
like the only really good

2242.96 --> 2248.4
thing i ever got out of doctors is just

2245.92 --> 2249.92
the utilization of their knowledge of

2248.4 --> 2251.76
physiology

2249.92 --> 2253.839
that's the thing that was kind of useful

2251.76 --> 2256.2400000000002
that they really know

2253.839 --> 2257.2
like literally the mechanics of every

2256.24 --> 2259.9199999999996
part and [ __ ]

2257.2 --> 2261.04
that's really good knowledge i like that

2259.92 --> 2264.7200000000003
but as for their

2261.04 --> 2267.839
solutions to things uh

2264.72 --> 2271.2799999999997
no not so much although

2267.839 --> 2275.2799999999997
sometimes they do have

2271.28 --> 2277.28
like practical advice here and there

2275.28 --> 2278.6400000000003
that have been like tested for hundreds

2277.28 --> 2282.4
of years and [ __ ]

2278.64 --> 2284.24
but other than that yeah

2282.4 --> 2286.2400000000002
my personal experience with doctors have

2284.24 --> 2289.5989999999997
never really been

2286.24 --> 2292.24
very great so

2289.599 --> 2294.1600000000003
i i felt forced earlier on to basically

2292.24 --> 2294.64
become my own doctor now i've never

2294.16 --> 2297.68
really

2294.64 --> 2300.48
mastered physiology knowing exactly the

2297.68 --> 2305.44
exposed functions and

2300.48 --> 2305.44
but i do know roughly every organ

2306.64 --> 2310.16
like i have a visual representation of

2309.119 --> 2312.96
my body

2310.16 --> 2314.72
thanks to like like those plastic dolls

2312.96 --> 2318.32
you get in biology and all that

2314.72 --> 2318.3199999999997
well that did really stick to me

2319.76 --> 2325.3590000000004
and because of just confrontation about

2323.599 --> 2327.2000000000003
yeah alternative news in the medical

2325.359 --> 2330.56
direction i've learned pretty much

2327.2 --> 2332.16
a lot about the body but from other

2330.56 --> 2334.48
perspectives

2332.16 --> 2335.359
so yeah i am confident enough to

2334.48 --> 2338.96
basically

2335.359 --> 2339.7599999999998
declare that i will be doing my own

2338.96 --> 2342.079
doctoring

2339.76 --> 2344.1600000000003
i'll be my own medical representative

2342.079 --> 2347.6800000000003
thank you very much

2344.16 --> 2349.52
i'll be the last one to decide

2347.68 --> 2351.5989999999997
but decide consciously it's not just

2349.52 --> 2353.7599999999998
gonna be a decision okay i guess i'll

2351.599 --> 2357.92
risk it and go with that

2353.76 --> 2361.28
no i will know i will know

2357.92 --> 2363.119
if it's good or not because of

2361.28 --> 2365.44
cross-referencing with so many other

2363.119 --> 2365.44
things

2369.29 --> 2372.389
[Music]

2378.8 --> 2383.8390000000004
okay forever conscious research channel

2409.44 --> 2412.64
gets everything diagnosed in 45 minutes

2412.319 --> 2425.839
for

2412.64 --> 2425.839
three dollars okay

2438.48 --> 2442.22
right well look the whole issue with

2441.2 --> 2444.0789999999997
cancer is

2442.22 --> 2448.0
[Music]

2444.079 --> 2448.319
it's it's just not really what people

2448.0 --> 2450.8
think

2448.319 --> 2452.16
it is you know the cover story for

2450.8 --> 2455.28
cancer again it's

2452.16 --> 2457.5989999999997
it's always the same isn't it

2455.28 --> 2459.599
the allopathic medical system always

2457.599 --> 2462.319
treats all these things

2459.599 --> 2464.96
like they're invasions of some kind like

2462.319 --> 2466.96
we're being invaded we have to combat it

2464.96 --> 2469.04
because of it's an and that's what they

2466.96 --> 2472.48
do with so many things

2469.04 --> 2474.0
viruses end with cancer well it's just a

2472.48 --> 2476.2400000000002
mechanism

2474.0 --> 2478.16
now it can be dangerous especially if

2476.24 --> 2480.16
it's going to basically get in the way

2478.16 --> 2483.68
of vital functions like

2480.16 --> 2486.72
press something shut you know like an

2483.68 --> 2488.96
artery or some kind of organ yeah that

2486.72 --> 2489.9199999999996
part is dangerous and that would be the

2488.96 --> 2492.96
only

2489.92 --> 2495.28
good enough reason to basically say okay

2492.96 --> 2497.44
i we have to remove at least a part of

2495.28 --> 2499.6800000000003
it to

2497.44 --> 2501.28
retain the vital functions like that but

2499.68 --> 2502.96
it's very dangerous

2501.28 --> 2505.119
it's proven that's usually very

2502.96 --> 2506.319
dangerous to start cutting in cancerous

2505.119 --> 2509.359
tissue

2506.319 --> 2511.359
can get more aggressive it often does

2509.359 --> 2512.88
so it would be half yeah it's always

2511.359 --> 2516.88
dangerous

2512.88 --> 2518.7200000000003
but in my opinion going on to the german

2516.88 --> 2521.839
new medicine things

2518.72 --> 2522.72
i think that if you just have a good

2521.839 --> 2524.56
health

2522.72 --> 2526.0789999999997
good confidence in yourself and you

2524.56 --> 2528.0
don't stress you're out

2526.079 --> 2530.1600000000003
yourself out by this idea you're being

2528.0 --> 2533.52
invaded by a lump or something

2530.16 --> 2535.44
and you see it as a medical side effect

2533.52 --> 2537.599
of your inner metabolism which it kind

2535.44 --> 2541.28
of really is

2537.599 --> 2543.2000000000003
then yeah you can get lumps

2541.28 --> 2545.52
and then eventually they'll go away

2543.2 --> 2548.72
again like they harden up

2545.52 --> 2550.96
and then they might dissolve or yeah you

2548.72 --> 2552.319
maybe they won't dissolve and then they

2550.96 --> 2556.56
can basically be pat

2552.319 --> 2558.96
plastic surgically removed afterward

2556.56 --> 2560.7999999999997
sort of things like that that's a much

2558.96 --> 2562.56
better way to go around than just

2560.8 --> 2566.1600000000003
starting to attack your body with

2562.56 --> 2566.16
radiation and chemicals

2567.92 --> 2573.76
now of course i can't give other people

2570.96 --> 2575.2
doctors advice like that because i am

2573.76 --> 2578.1600000000003
not a doctor i just

2575.2 --> 2579.2
only take medical responsibility for

2578.16 --> 2581.2799999999997
myself

2579.2 --> 2582.48
i'm my own doctor that does not make me

2581.28 --> 2585.28
a doctor

2582.48 --> 2586.88
so i can't advise people on this all i

2585.28 --> 2591.0400000000004
can say is that

2586.88 --> 2595.2000000000003
there's other studies medical studies

2591.04 --> 2597.92
that just throw a whole new perspective

2595.2 --> 2599.9199999999996
on the situation especially of cancer

2597.92 --> 2603.76
because the german new medicine

2599.92 --> 2606.56
was made by somebody who had to deal

2603.76 --> 2609.28
with cancer

2606.56 --> 2611.119
like of their own son or the death of

2609.28 --> 2614.88
their own son and they got cancer

2611.119 --> 2617.839
and then yeah they survived that and

2614.88 --> 2617.839
then studied it

2619.2 --> 2625.5989999999997
very extensively but it is

2623.359 --> 2629.2799999999997
look the most important thing is is that

2625.599 --> 2629.28
you just don't panic because

2629.839 --> 2635.359
yeah if you just stress out in cancer

2632.079 --> 2638.2400000000002
situations that tends to make it worse

2635.359 --> 2638.24
more burdensome

2638.8 --> 2643.04
and hey dealing with the medical system

2640.96 --> 2645.359
can be freaking stressful

2643.04 --> 2647.2
like if you once you get yourself

2645.359 --> 2652.72
diagnosed with cancer

2647.2 --> 2652.72
the doctors will start to try to invade

2653.359 --> 2658.48
your your body pretty much they start to

2656.0 --> 2660.56
like no no no this person has cancer so

2658.48 --> 2662.319
they must do this or they're mentally

2660.56 --> 2665.2799999999997
irresponsible

2662.319 --> 2666.56
doctors do that [ __ ] okay because of

2665.28 --> 2669.76
their training

2666.56 --> 2672.72
because of their perspective that that

2669.76 --> 2676.3190000000004
they can draw all these consequences of

2672.72 --> 2680.0
through the medical system

2676.319 --> 2681.04
see you got to be careful with that once

2680.0 --> 2683.68
you start

2681.04 --> 2684.72
to get yourself diagnosed with that

2683.68 --> 2686.64
officially

2684.72 --> 2689.5989999999997
yeah you might get one of these doctors

2686.64 --> 2691.839
that's just going to act like that

2689.599 --> 2692.8
uh it will probably depend on the

2691.839 --> 2694.319
country you're in

2692.8 --> 2695.8390000000004
i don't think they do it like that here

2694.319 --> 2697.44
in the netherlands

2695.839 --> 2699.2
but i don't know maybe in the us they

2697.44 --> 2700.8
will i don't know it depends on how the

2699.2 --> 2702.8799999999997
rules work with that how easy your

2700.8 --> 2707.52
doctor can basically just

2702.88 --> 2711.28
take over in situations

2707.52 --> 2711.28
but yeah

2715.28 --> 2718.48
so you you always got to be careful you

2717.359 --> 2720.24
got to weigh out

2718.48 --> 2721.68
what your situation is because the

2720.24 --> 2724.9599999999996
situation

2721.68 --> 2727.7599999999998
you are in as you develop got

2724.96 --> 2729.68
cancer symptoms of something that

2727.76 --> 2730.3190000000004
matters a lot because if you are in the

2729.68 --> 2732.319
middle of

2730.319 --> 2735.359
being really poisoned and stressed out

2732.319 --> 2738.079
you have a lot of bad habits

2735.359 --> 2739.68
right then it's just going to pretty

2738.079 --> 2741.92
much be dangerous

2739.68 --> 2743.44
one way or the other and then from a

2741.92 --> 2746.079
certain choice

2743.44 --> 2748.16
balancing perspective you could consider

2746.079 --> 2749.599
okay just quickly get rid of it as quick

2748.16 --> 2751.359
as possible because you're

2749.599 --> 2753.839
not probably not gonna survive if you

2751.359 --> 2757.2
don't with the way you're living

2753.839 --> 2759.2799999999997
or you could try to get rid of all these

2757.2 --> 2760.8799999999997
bad habits all of a sudden but that's

2759.28 --> 2761.28
also going to cause a lot of stress

2760.88 --> 2764.079
because

2761.28 --> 2766.7200000000003
changing habits causes a lot of stress

2764.079 --> 2770.5600000000004
and you're not really

2766.72 --> 2772.7999999999997
in the in the physical state to do that

2770.56 --> 2774.48
really well when that happens when you

2772.8 --> 2778.8
have cancer so

2774.48 --> 2780.96
yeah it's it's a little complicated like

2778.8 --> 2784.079
that

2780.96 --> 2786.16
you just gotta be careful

2784.079 --> 2787.28
gotta be careful don't don't stress

2786.16 --> 2790.64
yourself out don't

2787.28 --> 2792.079
rush things whatever you do take your

2790.64 --> 2795.359
time to research

2792.079 --> 2799.6800000000003
and think about it carefully don't feel

2795.359 --> 2803.2
rushed no matter what they say

2799.68 --> 2805.839
really of course if you're already in a

2803.2 --> 2807.359
long trajectory and you're like

2805.839 --> 2809.92
you've already gone through a lot of

2807.359 --> 2811.7599999999998
[ __ ] chemotherapy and all that

2809.92 --> 2813.44
then things become completely different

2811.76 --> 2815.5200000000004
after that point

2813.44 --> 2816.88
i'm sorry to say that my expertise kind

2815.52 --> 2820.72
of ends

2816.88 --> 2824.0
because i would never go there

2820.72 --> 2826.24
i've seen what what that does to people

2824.0 --> 2827.599
and it destroys so much of the natural

2826.24 --> 2830.7999999999997
functions of your body

2827.599 --> 2832.319
often irreversible that

2830.8 --> 2834.4
i just after that point i can't

2832.319 --> 2836.24
guarantee the natural restoration

2834.4 --> 2839.359
workings of the body anymore

2836.24 --> 2846.16
i've seen what it did to my mother

2839.359 --> 2846.16
yeah she died not too long after

2846.88 --> 2850.7200000000003
when in my personal opinion now this is

2849.119 --> 2853.76
of course in retrospect

2850.72 --> 2856.0
right so who am i but in my retrospect

2853.76 --> 2860.2400000000002
if she probably hadn't done anything

2856.0 --> 2860.24
she might have survived it

2861.04 --> 2864.48
even though it was for it was kind of

2863.52 --> 2867.7599999999998
yeah

2864.48 --> 2870.4
it was very spread out and [ __ ] but that

2867.76 --> 2873.6800000000003
doesn't necessarily have to mean

2870.4 --> 2875.599
the end though on the other hand as yeah

2873.68 --> 2877.52
as i kind of described as an example

2875.599 --> 2882.079
right before this

2877.52 --> 2886.16
she was on so many pharmaceuticals

2882.079 --> 2888.48
that it they probably pretty much caused

2886.16 --> 2889.7599999999998
it in my opinion i can't prove that

2888.48 --> 2893.72
directly

2889.76 --> 2898.0
so like antidepressants and

2893.72 --> 2900.5589999999997
anti-allergy and like anti-panic

2898.0 --> 2901.92
like all the all the [ __ ] all the [ __ ]

2900.559 --> 2905.28
we all know

2901.92 --> 2909.119
from back then like up until 2005

2905.28 --> 2912.8390000000004
she was all into that [ __ ] xanax and

2909.119 --> 2914.079
ugh all that junk so yeah that's

2912.839 --> 2917.68
absolutely

2914.079 --> 2920.48
gonna contribute to aggressive

2917.68 --> 2921.04
bodily responses constant attack of the

2920.48 --> 2923.68
body

2921.04 --> 2925.04
constant attack so yeah if cancer breaks

2923.68 --> 2928.319
out it's gonna be

2925.04 --> 2931.52
it's gonna be war

2928.319 --> 2933.04
it's it it's like the cancer is trying a

2931.52 --> 2934.64
police state crackdown because

2933.04 --> 2937.44
everything is out of control it's all

2934.64 --> 2937.44
poison the hell

2937.839 --> 2943.839
and that's what happened to my mother

2941.119 --> 2943.839
15 years ago

2946.14 --> 2949.25
[Music]

2953.57 --> 2960.9790000000003

2974.16 --> 2978.96
colon cancer and the other survived

2975.92 --> 2978.96
leukemia right

2979.2 --> 2985.839
yeah leukemia is a tough one

2987.92 --> 2992.319
problem with it so as far as i heard it

2990.48 --> 2996.64
depends on what causes it

2992.319 --> 2996.64
right what caused it

2996.72 --> 3000.7999999999997
from what i remember it's often tends to

2999.119 --> 3003.44
return because it's

3000.8 --> 3004.1600000000003
it's comes from the bone marrow and one

3003.44 --> 3007.04
yeah

3004.16 --> 3009.7599999999998
you'd have to like replace it if it's if

3007.04 --> 3014.319
it's gotten really bad and that's a very

3009.76 --> 3014.3190000000004
even dangerous procedure

3016.4 --> 3027.839
although i do find that sensible

3020.0 --> 3027.839
to combat it like that

3031.93 --> 3036.9489999999996
[Music]

3038.8 --> 3043.04
alkaline systems prevent cancer

3043.28 --> 3045.52
well

3046.319 --> 3050.96
the way you say that again that's from

3049.2 --> 3052.3999999999996
the perspective that cancer is an

3050.96 --> 3054.8
invasive species

3052.4 --> 3057.28
or something invasive thing it's not

3054.8 --> 3059.3590000000004
alkaline systems merely cause the body

3057.28 --> 3062.559
to have better

3059.359 --> 3063.52
natural function in many ways causing

3062.559 --> 3066.96
the cancer to

3063.52 --> 3069.28
not have to do its thing because

3066.96 --> 3071.119
everybody always has cancer in the body

3069.28 --> 3074.3190000000004
since they're born

3071.119 --> 3076.7200000000003
all the time all their life

3074.319 --> 3078.0
like what is it 20 different types of

3076.72 --> 3079.839
cancer

3078.0 --> 3081.28
it's a natural part of the body's

3079.839 --> 3085.839
mechanism

3081.28 --> 3085.8390000000004
they're like police functionaries

3087.599 --> 3091.599
the the trauma response team one could

3090.0 --> 3093.119
consider especially when you look at

3091.599 --> 3098.079
from the german new medicine

3093.119 --> 3098.079
perspective it's a my response team

3104.4 --> 3107.76
or your crime response team if you want

3107.359 --> 3111.839
to

3107.76 --> 3111.8390000000004
keep the police metaphor in there

3112.38 --> 3115.4390000000003
[Music]

3116.0 --> 3119.119
why do you create the ultimate acid

3119.119 --> 3126.96
i don't know i don't think so

3124.64 --> 3129.2799999999997
i don't think it acidifies things it

3126.96 --> 3131.92
just causes a lot of

3129.28 --> 3135.2000000000003
cellular oscillation and disruptive of

3131.92 --> 3135.2000000000003
the microcellular

3136.839 --> 3139.839
organisms

3141.68 --> 3153.839
i don't think it necessarily acidifies

the environment

3155.67 --> 3163.44
[Music]

3158.559 --> 3167.52
emf protection needed for tech use

3163.44 --> 3171.28
well yeah or you could simply

3167.52 --> 3173.44
build your technical setup in a way

3171.28 --> 3176.2400000000002
that it's just efficient and there isn't

3173.44 --> 3179.68
going to be a lot of emf

3176.24 --> 3183.9199999999996
you know by wiring everything

3179.68 --> 3187.359
like i do i don't use wireless

3183.92 --> 3191.2000000000003
i don't i

3187.359 --> 3191.2
categorically refuse

3191.599 --> 3209.28
only thing wireless is my basic

non-internet capable phone

3209.28 --> 3212.849
[Music]

3229.28 --> 3233.3590000000004
oh by the way i am seeing some cars over

3231.52 --> 3236.16
there at church

3233.359 --> 3237.359
on the sunday hooray although it's not a

3236.16 --> 3239.2799999999997
lot of cars

3237.359 --> 3241.2
at least there's a couple i don't know

3239.28 --> 3243.2000000000003
what they're doing it's probably not

3241.2 --> 3245.359
this standard sunday

3243.2 --> 3246.64
thing because i don't think they do that

3245.359 --> 3248.64
anymore

3246.64 --> 3250.319
so it must be a special event somebody

3248.64 --> 3254.7999999999997
getting married or baptized

3250.319 --> 3254.8
probably baptized something like that

3260.72 --> 3265.839
my keyboard and mouse are wireless is

3262.8 --> 3265.8390000000004
this bad

3269.2 --> 3275.52
it's not very good although

3272.96 --> 3277.359
considering look every time you're gonna

3275.52 --> 3279.04
have a wireless connection of anything

3277.359 --> 3282.0789999999997
you got to consider

3279.04 --> 3283.92
what is the bandwidth of the

3282.079 --> 3285.44
information being transferred now if

3283.92 --> 3289.6800000000003
this benefit

3285.44 --> 3289.68
bandwidth is very small because

3289.76 --> 3293.3590000000004
that's how it was designed because it

3291.359 --> 3294.72
doesn't need anymore it's just a couple

3293.359 --> 3297.92
of

3294.72 --> 3299.52
pulses if it's like a binary pulse for

3297.92 --> 3302.7200000000003
example then you need

3299.52 --> 3304.559
super little it's just going to be if

3302.72 --> 3306.72
need very little energy very

3304.559 --> 3307.8390000000004
little signal to get through but if it's

3306.72 --> 3310.799
going to be a broad

3307.839 --> 3312.64
information spectrum like a bluetooth or

3310.799 --> 3317.68
whatever

3312.64 --> 3319.92
or wi-fi then even if you only send very

3317.68 --> 3322.96
simple information it's going to be sent

3319.92 --> 3326.079
in with the entire spectrum

3322.96 --> 3326.079
and that's not going to help

3327.76 --> 3331.0400000000004
so it all depends on

3331.119 --> 3335.359
on what kind of device what kind of

3333.44 --> 3337.44
wireless system you have i

3335.359 --> 3339.92
use wired everything i don't use

3337.44 --> 3343.2000000000003
wireless

3339.92 --> 3348.0
good wire on my mouse

3343.2 --> 3350.64
wire on my webcam

3348.0 --> 3350.64
on everything

3353.28 --> 3358.96
you know wires are not a problem not

3356.48 --> 3360.48
at all the only thing you got to do is

3358.96 --> 3362.799
organize it well

3360.48 --> 3364.799
just don't throw everything like oh just

3362.799 --> 3366.319
get away with the wire yeah then it's

3364.799 --> 3368.64
eventually gonna

3366.319 --> 3371.68
put yeah turn like a giant tangled up

3368.64 --> 3373.7599999999998
mess you gotta organize your wires

3371.68 --> 3376.0789999999997
and ensure that they're going to be out

3373.76 --> 3378.7990000000004
of movement way so you don't trip

3376.079 --> 3380.6400000000003
over them or get caught or whatever just

3378.799 --> 3381.44
organize the wires and it's fine you

3380.64 --> 3384.0
don't need

3381.44 --> 3384.0
wireless

3388.72 --> 3393.2
yeah to me really wireless is for lazy

3391.839 --> 3396.96
people

3393.2 --> 3396.96
that's really it that's all it is

3397.44 --> 3405.839

agreed yeah i always thought that was

3512.96 --> 3515.68
very annoying

3514.079 --> 3517.6800000000003
when it was with other people and they

3515.68 --> 3519.359
used wireless and it's like oh the mouse

3517.68 --> 3521.2
stopped working oh [ __ ] i have to put

3519.359 --> 3523.7599999999998

now i can't use my computer anymore

3542.079 --> 3545.52
because i

3543.44 --> 3546.799
i do have to need batteries and i don't

3545.52 --> 3549.81
have them

3562.079 --> 3566.96
everywhere

3562.88 --> 3570.7200000000003
it would be just a universal internet

3566.96 --> 3573.68
of or use the universal ethernet

3570.72 --> 3575.2799999999997
just cables freaking everywhere that you

3573.68 --> 3587.839
can click into

3575.28 --> 3587.8390000000004
like a public internet

3588.96 --> 3592.4
like that there would be internet

3591.16 --> 3596.96
availability

3592.4 --> 3601.2000000000003
through wires standardized you know

3596.96 --> 3605.2
i'd even almost like standardize it in

3601.2 --> 3609.04
in buildings like

3605.2 --> 3610.8799999999997
yeah but it's so easy if everybody just

3609.04 --> 3614.64
uses their mobiles and

3610.88 --> 3616.319
just one one thing just radiating

3614.64 --> 3618.8799999999997
everyone and then everybody can be

3616.319 --> 3622.079
connected so easy and so healthy for you

3618.88 --> 3622.88
right now i i just go with standardizing

3622.079 --> 3626.319
no

3622.88 --> 3629.839
just put standardized wiring

3626.319 --> 3629.839
everywhere in everything

3630.559 --> 3635.3590000000004
and make it like really this

3632.96 --> 3637.839
module-based system even

3635.359 --> 3638.5589999999997
just modulize that there's internet

3637.839 --> 3643.839
wiring

3638.559 --> 3643.8390000000004
everywhere in everything

3644.64 --> 3649.1189999999997
and then like with clickable connective

3647.28 --> 3649.599
deconnective so you could literally

3649.119 --> 3653.44
build

3649.599 --> 3656.0
separated pathways in the standardized

3653.44 --> 3657.839
moduling system of the internet wiring

3656.0 --> 3662.079
in buildings

3657.839 --> 3663.839
that sort of thing that's my

3662.079 --> 3665.76
that's the direction that i would like

3663.839 --> 3668.839
things to take but it doesn't seem like

3665.76 --> 3671.8390000000004
that's going there anytime soon

3668.839 --> 3671.839
unfortunately

3672.56 --> 3676.5
[Music]

3679.64 --> 3684.679
[Music]

3702.96 --> 3707.92
yeah indeed iron fe and then look if it

3706.0 --> 3708.48
would ever transit to that if like

3707.92 --> 3711.44
people would

3708.48 --> 3713.04
ever give up on wireless in it i just

3711.44 --> 3713.839
just don't see it happening unless

3713.04 --> 3715.68
there's something

3713.839 --> 3717.2
that would prevent it from working

3715.68 --> 3720.319
anymore or blah

3717.2 --> 3722.24
whatever the thing is there's just

3720.319 --> 3723.92
too many quick easy conveniences and

3722.24 --> 3725.2
that's really the main advantage because

3723.92 --> 3726.88
if you're gonna have a wire you're gonna

3725.2 --> 3728.3999999999996
have to put that wire there

3726.88 --> 3730.319
with the wireless all you need is a

3728.4 --> 3732.799
tower in the distance

3730.319 --> 3734.88
so yeah quick advantage it's

3732.799 --> 3738.799
unmistakable unfortunately

3734.88 --> 3742.96
but on long-term solutions

3738.799 --> 3742.96
i'd go with wires every time

3744.559 --> 3748.6400000000003
and yeah if it were up to me i'd get

3746.88 --> 3751.2000000000003
like this

3748.64 --> 3753.52
i'd reapproach the whole situation and

3751.2 --> 3756.0789999999997
really make it like a highway

3753.52 --> 3757.2
an internet highway the wires would be

3756.079 --> 3760.319
like a highway

3757.2 --> 3761.7599999999998
everywhere and we'd have to fall under

3760.319 --> 3765.599
public maintenance too

3761.76 --> 3768.7990000000004
just like roads do you know

3765.599 --> 3772.2400000000002
they would have to be kept

3768.799 --> 3783.839
in order and functioning and

3772.24 --> 3783.839
unhacked and all that [ __ ]

3791.119 --> 3798.1600000000003
oh my god not again yeah you're

3794.799 --> 3800.48
you're right do you have rap work it's a

3798.16 --> 3800.48
bow

3800.72 --> 3806.319
story behind it i bought it at a

3803.2 --> 3806.319
renaissance fair

3808.48 --> 3812.48
i think it's from hungary or something

3810.799 --> 3815.0389999999998
that guy

3812.48 --> 3815.039
who made it

3816.079 --> 3822.0
that's it that's the story i got a bow

3819.599 --> 3822.96
i thought it would be cool to hang it

3822.0 --> 3826.16
there

3822.96 --> 3829.359
as a prop that's it this is don't worry

3826.16 --> 3829.359
about it jeff rabbork

3835.2 --> 3839.2799999999997
yeah guys look one day if it's up to me

3837.359 --> 3840.96
i get every if i ever get out of this

3839.28 --> 3843.76
room right

3840.96 --> 3846.079
i can better get a better setup for when

3843.76 --> 3848.88
i could actually have a separate room

3846.079 --> 3848.88
for my show

3848.96 --> 3854.88
who would who would think of that you

3850.72 --> 3854.8799999999997
know that would be damn cool for me

3855.599 --> 3857.76
just

3858.72 --> 3864.0789999999997
if only i'd have like what i had

3862.16 --> 3866.48
when i was living with my ex or even

3864.079 --> 3868.2400000000002
before that in houda

3866.48 --> 3870.48
because i had an entire apartment to

3868.24 --> 3873.359
myself i could have done this

3870.48 --> 3876.96
great built an entire background

3873.359 --> 3878.64
interesting backdrop to look at

3876.96 --> 3895.839
do all kinds of things with that but

3878.64 --> 3895.839
yeah i don't have the room so this is it

3914.079 --> 3919.2000000000003
well look george sanford here's the

3917.2 --> 3922.5589999999997
thing

3919.2 --> 3924.0
oh it's too complicated without without

3922.559 --> 3927.039
wireless right

3924.0 --> 3928.799
or this other way look

3927.039 --> 3930.2400000000002
that doesn't mean that you should just

3928.799 --> 3933.0389999999998
have freaking

3930.24 --> 3935.0389999999998
wireless everywhere you know because the

3933.039 --> 3937.599
more wireless the more

3935.039 --> 3940.0
electrical pollution and all that

3937.599 --> 3943.2000000000003
radiological pollution i mean

3940.0 --> 3945.92
right so if it's just too far away

3943.2 --> 3947.0389999999998
then you might have just one transmitter

3945.92 --> 3950.7200000000003
receiver

3947.039 --> 3952.4
towards the other far away distant tower

3950.72 --> 3955.2799999999997
or whatever but if you just go

3952.4 --> 3956.0
wireless from that station on yeah

3955.28 --> 3958.2400000000002
wireless

3956.0 --> 3961.44
no not awareness if you go wired from

3958.24 --> 3962.72
that receiving station on

3961.44 --> 3965.119
that's just going to be a lot more

3962.72 --> 3967.7599999999998
healthy if you just only have that one

3965.119 --> 3970.799
transmitter for the long distance

3967.76 --> 3971.44
see because it's that long distance

3970.799 --> 3974.16
that's the

3971.44 --> 3975.76
real problem right i'll bridge that with

3974.16 --> 3978.0
a single wireless

3975.76 --> 3980.48
receiver transmitter for that distance

3978.0 --> 3983.68
and then go wired from that point on

3980.48 --> 3983.68
that would be my advice

3986.4 --> 3993.839
or at least that's what i would do

3989.52 --> 3993.839
if i were in that situation

3996.48 --> 4001.28
what how many packs of cigarettes do you

4000.48 --> 4005.119
smoke per day

4001.28 --> 4021.599
zero absolutely zero

4005.119 --> 4025.76
i don't smoke cigarettes yuck

4021.599 --> 4029.2000000000003
no i i just smoked joints that's it

4025.76 --> 4029.2000000000003
i don't like cigarettes at all

4029.44 --> 4032.96
cigarette to me is like a poor man's

4031.359 --> 4034.5589999999997
joint

4032.96 --> 4038.079
and i don't yeah i don't smoke

4034.559 --> 4042.2400000000002
constantly anyway i don't like that

4038.079 --> 4043.119
but i use yeah cigarettes are just dirty

4042.24 --> 4046.319
sauced

4043.119 --> 4048.319
things so what i do is i use that

4046.319 --> 4050.16
whole leaf tobacco that i got from

4048.319 --> 4052.88
canada

4050.16 --> 4054.799
it's just a little bitter over here and

4052.88 --> 4055.2000000000003
i have to cut it up myself but this

4054.799 --> 4057.119
stuff

4055.2 --> 4061.9199999999996
is much better much healthier much

4057.119 --> 4062.799
cleaner it's just the leaf as is organic

4061.92 --> 4064.7200000000003
and

4062.799 --> 4067.7599999999998
yeah i combine that with some good

4064.72 --> 4067.7599999999998
quality cannabis

4069.599 --> 4074.839
and i don't know how many i smoke a day

4072.319 --> 4077.52
probably quite a lot for the average

4074.839 --> 4080.319
person

4077.52 --> 4082.24
but i don't i'm not like a cigarette

4080.319 --> 4085.44
smoker that's literally gonna go

4082.24 --> 4086.8799999999997
through an entire package god i've never

4085.44 --> 4088.7200000000003
had that

4086.88 --> 4090.0
like i've had periods when i wouldn't

4088.72 --> 4092.16
smoke cannabis and only

4090.0 --> 4094.88
tobacco because i had to quit cannabis

4092.16 --> 4097.839
because it was driving me nuts

4094.88 --> 4101.12
i was that's like 10 years ago now but i

4097.839 --> 4101.12
quit for like five years

4102.839 --> 4107.839
uh was it eight years right

4105.839 --> 4109.199
five years i quit tobacco eight years i

4107.839 --> 4112.48
quit cannabis

4109.199 --> 4115.199
but yeah even then

4112.48 --> 4116.159
i i what i had appeared where i smoked

4115.199 --> 4120.3189999999995
uh

4116.159 --> 4123.199
i made my own cigarettes with

4120.319 --> 4125.1990000000005
uh yeah i would add clover powder to it

4123.199 --> 4126.879999999999
because i like that it's like

4125.199 --> 4128.4
kind of like the indonesian type

4126.88 --> 4130.56
cigarettes

4128.4 --> 4131.44
a little bit spicy i like that but even

4130.56 --> 4135.6
with that

4131.44 --> 4135.599999999999
i i'd smoke

4136.319 --> 4141.52
like six cigarettes a day at max

4139.6 --> 4143.1990000000005
although i had periods where i did

4141.52 --> 4146.56
really feel like chain smoking

4143.199 --> 4150.239
especially when i was driving

4146.56 --> 4153.279
because that was just a blast to do

4150.239 --> 4155.759
crazy times but

4153.279 --> 4161.839000000001
yeah i've never been like smoking a lot

4155.759 --> 4161.839
like my lungs just don't handle that

4163.92 --> 4170.719
how much weed do i smoke not a lot

4167.199 --> 4175.839
i don't know i don't know what is a lot

4170.719 --> 4175.839
i think it's a lot

4183.759 --> 4191.679
i know

4189.44 --> 4195.5199999999995
i think i'd prob i think i'm probably

4191.679 --> 4198.08
like smoking a gram of cannabis a day

4195.52 --> 4198.080000000001
roughly

4199.28 --> 4203.84
maybe more i don't know

4212.08 --> 4231.84
every two week uh

4216.64 --> 4231.84
14 days for an ounce whoa that's a lot

4244.159 --> 4251.44
smoking against allergies yeah yeah

4247.92 --> 4251.4400000000005
it does actually help a little

4255.84 --> 4261.360000000001
it's it's actually kind of weird i never

4258.4 --> 4265.04
even realized that

4261.36 --> 4267.28
but because

4265.04 --> 4268.08
my parents also used to smoke even my

4267.28 --> 4271.5199999999995
mother

4268.08 --> 4274.32
tobacco but then

4271.52 --> 4274.320000000001
like they quit

4274.56 --> 4278.159000000001
and my my father still doesn't smoke to

4276.8 --> 4282.159000000001
this day

4278.159 --> 4286.0
he's doing fine but my mother kind of

4282.159 --> 4288.0
after that she did like develop

4286.0 --> 4290.239
all the allergies because before that

4288.0 --> 4291.6
she didn't really get that bothered by

4290.239 --> 4294.32
it it seemed

4291.6 --> 4296.2390000000005
so maybe she shouldn't have stopped

4294.32 --> 4297.28
smoking it's really weird to realize

4296.239 --> 4299.599999999999
that

4297.28 --> 4302.96
but yeah i was so against it when i was

4299.6 --> 4302.96
a kid so was my brother

4303.6 --> 4308.96
and then just like a few years later i

4305.84 --> 4308.96
started smoking myself

4312.84 --> 4315.84
goody

4327.12 --> 4333.92
nah george sanford i would not rush

4330.56 --> 4333.92
to advise him that

4334.719 --> 4343.84
you know good servant has well

4338.8 --> 4343.84
certain medical issues so

4344.239 --> 4349.44
if he says he doesn't really like it he

4346.32 --> 4349.44
probably shouldn't do it

4351.76 --> 4355.280000000001
you know that's a good indicator if you

4353.199 --> 4357.36
don't like it you probably shouldn't do

4355.28 --> 4359.36
it

4357.36 --> 4362.0
that counted for my brother too because

4359.36 --> 4363.199
he like my brother tried cannabis one

4362.0 --> 4365.6
time and he

4363.199 --> 4371.839999999999
he said it gave him a major headache and

4365.6 --> 4371.84
never tried it again

4377.92 --> 4382.159
i had a very different response

4380.93 --> 4384.8
[Music]

4382.159 --> 4386.0
i was tripping balls and felt absolutely

4384.8 --> 4389.76
fantastic

4386.0 --> 4392.239
fantastic just like a giant

4389.76 --> 4393.280000000001
cloud of relief that's what i

4392.239 --> 4396.48
experienced it like

4393.28 --> 4399.84
the first few times damn

4396.48 --> 4399.839999999999
made a lot of impact

4403.4 --> 4406.54
[Music]

4414.48 --> 4419.36
right cbd yep

4419.84 --> 4426.08
i i would really like to try cbd i just

4424.88 --> 4429.52
never really got to

4426.08 --> 4433.44
it and yeah the good stuff is not

4429.52 --> 4436.64
really that cheap too you know so

4433.44 --> 4438.08
since well my cannabis use is already

4436.64 --> 4442.4800000000005
kind of expensive

4438.08 --> 4444.88
in my opinion to me so

4442.48 --> 4447.04
i've never really found like the room

4444.88 --> 4449.6
financially to just try it out

4447.04 --> 4451.92
like that because don't have money to

4449.6 --> 4455.360000000001
waste

4451.92 --> 4458.56
on trying out such things

4455.36 --> 4460.0
i like the good ones you're gonna be

4458.56 --> 4463.120000000001
like i would probably

4460.0 --> 4465.12
be paying like 80 euros at least for a

4463.12 --> 4469.09
good bottle

4465.12 --> 4470.239
of a good quality

4469.09 --> 4472.400000000001
[Music]

4470.239 --> 4475.12
and i know that razda had could probably

4472.4 --> 4478.239
get it for 10 euros or cheaper

4475.12 --> 4478.239
because he always does

4479.04 --> 4483.84
but unfortunately i'm not in that

4480.84 --> 4483.84
position

4494.96 --> 4499.12
might pick up cannabis in the future

4496.8 --> 4499.12
okay

4500.719 --> 4507.76
have i done other drugs like meth

4504.08 --> 4510.8
yuck well to be fair

4507.76 --> 4514.4800000000005
i tried it one time a

4510.8 --> 4516.64
very very very little bit it was at like

4514.48 --> 4521.599999999999
this crazy

4516.64 --> 4521.6
uh a party in a house

4521.679 --> 4525.04
and you call that it's not

4525.76 --> 4528.400000000001
like they were

4530.159 --> 4533.92
they were occupying that how do you call

4531.76 --> 4538.400000000001
that again

4533.92 --> 4540.0
this is

4538.4 --> 4542.159
like they didn't own the house but they

4540.0 --> 4542.88
were staying there anyway how do you

4542.159 --> 4553.839999999999
call that again

4542.88 --> 4553.84
damn it i lost the word for it ah

4556.08 --> 4561.679
not a house sitter no no and no that's

4559.44 --> 4562.48
exactly not what i meant no it's

4561.679 --> 4564.4800000000005
basically

4562.48 --> 4566.4
getting into somebody else squatting

4564.48 --> 4567.678999999999
that's the word yes thank you very much

4566.4 --> 4569.92
agm

4567.679 --> 4570.719
right squatting it was like in a spotted

4569.92 --> 4575.12
place

4570.719 --> 4575.12
and it was like this parter party

4575.84 --> 4582.56
right and it was all like

4579.199 --> 4584.5599999999995
punkers and [ __ ] and like punk music and

4582.56 --> 4586.88
yeah i tried it one time there because

4584.56 --> 4587.92
it was like okay well if i'm gonna try

4586.88 --> 4591.04
it anytime

4587.92 --> 4593.12
this is probably the place to do it

4591.04 --> 4594.56
so i met this guy there that i've never

4593.12 --> 4597.76
met before

4594.56 --> 4599.6
and he seemed kind of sleazy but still

4597.76 --> 4601.6
nice enough and he had like oh look i

4599.6 --> 4603.76
got this stuff

4601.6 --> 4605.6
that's just this powder and he was

4603.76 --> 4608.719
taking that and i'm like

4605.6 --> 4611.76
uh i might want to try that just

4608.719 --> 4613.52
a little and i'd like what was it like a

4611.76 --> 4615.1990000000005
quarter though it's like

4613.52 --> 4616.96
you probably shouldn't even he wouldn't

4615.199 --> 4620.239
probably even feel anything from that

4616.96 --> 4620.719
they tried that and the ex yeah i did

4620.239 --> 4623.839999999999
feel

4620.719 --> 4627.679
things from it but it was just

4623.84 --> 4630.719
ugh it felt like

4627.679 --> 4633.92
i was fake enthusiastic

4630.719 --> 4637.44
like i was being i felt like being

4633.92 --> 4638.4800000000005
so pushy just like yeah i want to do

4637.44 --> 4641.599999999999
everything

4638.48 --> 4644.5599999999995
but i don't feel anything about it

4641.6 --> 4646.320000000001
it's just being compelled to do

4644.56 --> 4650.88
something

4646.32 --> 4654.639999999999
but without any inspiration or any

4650.88 --> 4657.84
dream so it was just like

4654.64 --> 4659.84
ugh this is stupid i felt like i was

4657.84 --> 4662.08
literally wasting my time there

4659.84 --> 4663.84
it wasn't really that fun i just felt

4662.08 --> 4665.679
like i was being pushed around

4663.84 --> 4667.52
constantly from the inside

4665.679 --> 4678.0
so after that i never really tried again

4667.52 --> 4681.76
it was just

4678.0 --> 4684.0
and yeah that's about the extent

4681.76 --> 4686.08
that i've ever went to when it concerns

4684.0 --> 4688.4
drug experiments i have never really

4686.08 --> 4692.08
tried anything else

4688.4 --> 4696.48
like cocaine never heroin absolutely

4692.08 --> 4700.5599999999995
never and like mushrooms or

4696.48 --> 4703.919999999999
lsd well i think i did actually try lsd

4700.56 --> 4706.719
once when i was 15

4703.92 --> 4709.12
but it was like i didn't even know what

4706.719 --> 4711.12
it was

4709.12 --> 4713.5199999999995
they call it acid and i thought like oh

4711.12 --> 4715.76
yeah that's cool like right

4713.52 --> 4718.4800000000005
but i didn't even know what it was but

4715.76 --> 4721.360000000001
hey the colors were amazing

4718.48 --> 4723.04
because i we went out and then i got to

4721.36 --> 4725.839999999999
see like a morning

4723.04 --> 4728.159
sunrise with all those colors and that

4725.84 --> 4729.92
was pretty freaking amazing

4728.159 --> 4731.92
so that was an interesting experience

4729.92 --> 4734.96
that one time but never felt like oh

4731.92 --> 4738.56
yeah i need to do that again

4734.96 --> 4741.679
no and then of course there's the weird

4738.56 --> 4744.64
freaky dark world

4741.679 --> 4746.84
stuff i i got ayahuasca i think but i

4744.64 --> 4749.4400000000005
didn't even know what that was at the

4746.84 --> 4751.4400000000005
time

4749.44 --> 4753.36
but yeah the experiences though

4751.44 --> 4754.639999999999
interesting were not very pleasant

4753.36 --> 4758.239
either

4754.64 --> 4760.2390000000005
so yeah no

4758.239 --> 4761.28
the only real thing that kind of stuck

4760.239 --> 4764.879999999999
to me was

4761.28 --> 4768.639999999999
cannabis and i guess

4764.88 --> 4771.679
beer just beer not stronger

4768.64 --> 4773.84
not liquor or anything just beer

4771.679 --> 4776.719
and that's like yeah man that's that's

4773.84 --> 4779.12
gonna last me a lifetime

4776.719 --> 4781.6
in the sense that if i'd have to be on

4779.12 --> 4785.04
drugs that'll do it

4781.6 --> 4791.84
that'll do it i don't really need

4785.04 --> 4791.84
anything else

4796.4 --> 4805.839999999999
yeah i'll bet manual advice

4813.84 --> 4818.400000000001
it's just that every time people take

4816.56 --> 4820.080000000001
that they take it for the rush or

4818.4 --> 4823.04
whatever

4820.08 --> 4825.6
i think with cocaine especially but i

4823.04 --> 4832.48
don't get it

4825.6 --> 4835.679
i get those rushes all by myself

4832.48 --> 4837.919999999999
literally i don't need anything like

4835.679 --> 4837.92
that

4838.239 --> 4844.08
i've got enough enough impulse and

4840.48 --> 4845.919999999999
enough like tension in myself

4844.08 --> 4848.4
like oh i'm going someplace that's

4845.92 --> 4851.4400000000005
exciting to me well that tension

4848.4 --> 4853.92
once i get it under control

4851.44 --> 4855.12
it makes me very active i get a lot of

4853.92 --> 4861.84
energy from that so

4855.12 --> 4861.84
why the hell would i take that [ __ ]

4869.679 --> 4875.84
what the hell is that

4886.84 --> 4889.84
hmm

4891.199 --> 4896.4
christmas tree you mean pine tree pine

4894.08 --> 4900.159
tree mushrooms the uh

4896.4 --> 4901.92
the red ones right

4900.159 --> 4903.199
yeah they can yield some interesting

4901.92 --> 4916.32
experiences

4903.199 --> 4918.879999999999
can be very dangerous though

4916.32 --> 4920.08
i don't know if i ever tried that i

4918.88 --> 4923.28
might have

4920.08 --> 4926.159
one time but i don't remember when

4923.28 --> 4928.159
even maybe that's typical side effect if

4926.159 --> 4928.638999999999
you ever tried you forget you ever tried

4928.159 --> 4932.239
it

4928.639 --> 4932.2390000000005
or when it's i don't know

4932.4 --> 4936.799999999999
uh weird [ __ ]

4935.6 --> 4938.56
it could have been a dark world

4936.8 --> 4938.88
experience that i never physically tried

4938.56 --> 4941.04
it

4938.88 --> 4942.4800000000005
that's just a weird thing with me and my

4941.04 --> 4944.32
past sometimes

4942.48 --> 4946.239
i remember things that i just can't

4944.32 --> 4948.08
pinpoint ever having

4946.239 --> 4949.599999999999
like proof that i actually physically

4948.08 --> 4950.48
did it yet i have these extensive

4949.6 --> 4954.159000000001
memories

4950.48 --> 4959.199
it's very weird and yeah i

4954.159 --> 4961.5199999999995
blame what happened

4959.199 --> 4963.678999999999
yeah with the big vision thing that

4961.52 --> 4973.84
really kind of

4963.679 --> 4973.84
made things weird for me in ways

4974.239 --> 4977.678999999999
but yeah i can still pinpoint things

4976.48 --> 4980.159
that i can definitely

4977.679 --> 4980.96
confirm that i've physically done as

4980.159 --> 4982.638999999999
well

4980.96 --> 4986.719
so and i still have plenty of things

4982.639 --> 4989.4400000000005
that i've done in the real world

4986.719 --> 4991.36
like why i just told about that party i

4989.44 --> 4994.0
still remember that clearly and i know

4991.36 --> 4994.0
that was real

4998.84 --> 5001.84
absolutely

5029.04 --> 5033.76
nitrous what

5034.56 --> 5042.159000000001
wow this is a lot of drug stocks guys

5038.56 --> 5046.2390000000005
this is this is getting bad

5042.159 --> 5048.08
yeah don't do drugs boys and girls don't

5046.239 --> 5049.839999999999
even if you're 12 years old and you can

5048.08 --> 5052.719
watch this video

5049.84 --> 5052.719
just don't do it

5052.88 --> 5058.0
it's much better to just try to

5056.0 --> 5059.84
learn as much as you can you know and if

5058.0 --> 5061.52
you don't like the materials you have to

5059.84 --> 5063.6
learn in school

5061.52 --> 5065.76
then at least find something else that

5063.6 --> 5068.400000000001
you do find interesting

5065.76 --> 5069.679
and learn in that if you see a future

5068.4 --> 5074.159
for if it's going to be like

5069.679 --> 5077.04
useless stuff

5074.159 --> 5079.62
don't drown yourself in it but if you

5077.04 --> 5080.88
can figure out like hey this can lead to

5079.62 --> 5083.36
[Music]

5080.88 --> 5084.0
some kind of grip on the situation i

5083.36 --> 5087.199
don't know like

5084.0 --> 5090.719
programming skills or designer skills or

5087.199 --> 5094.08
anything then

5090.719 --> 5096.8
it's better to just focus on that

5094.08 --> 5099.6
and not do drugs trust me trust me on

5096.8 --> 5103.76
that every time i did do that

5099.6 --> 5103.76
always been for the better in the end

5104.159 --> 5107.92
because i didn't really do any drugs

5106.639 --> 5112.56
until i was pretty much

5107.92 --> 5115.52
15 at all except for sugar

5112.56 --> 5117.360000000001
and maybe a bit of caffeine through

5115.52 --> 5120.719
candy as well

5117.36 --> 5121.44
but other than that nothing and i spend

5120.719 --> 5125.199
my time

5121.44 --> 5127.5199999999995
just expanding my skills a lot

5125.199 --> 5128.638999999999
and learning you know things that i

5127.52 --> 5131.679
thought was interesting

5128.639 --> 5132.0
like etymology with my family you know

5131.679 --> 5135.12
it

5132.0 --> 5138.32
helped that my family also

5135.12 --> 5140.159
liked learning these things

5138.32 --> 5141.599999999999
so then when i would go to them they

5140.159 --> 5143.679
would

5141.6 --> 5145.679
we would talk about it hours on end

5143.679 --> 5149.52
sometimes

5145.679 --> 5149.52
figure out where words came from

5149.92 --> 5157.52
what it meant

5155.679 --> 5159.4400000000005
right anyway i'm gonna round out the
