77.46 --> 85.63999999999999
so sorry for starting late

81.42 --> 85.64
I went for grocery shopping

85.74 --> 90.17999999999999
kind of late

87.42 --> 92.46000000000001
yeah because it has been raining pretty

90.18 --> 96.96000000000001
much all the time

92.46 --> 99.72
and I tried to find a dry spot to do it

96.96 --> 101.28
but yeah as a result I came back like

99.72 --> 102.96
after one

101.28 --> 105.6
so

102.96 --> 107.22
but yeah right now it's it seems to be

105.6 --> 108.96
dried up a little

107.22 --> 112.439
but there's like pools of water

108.96 --> 116.15899999999999
everywhere like on the road

112.439 --> 119.03999999999999
because it has been yeah raining a lot

116.159 --> 121.32000000000001
yesterday in the night

119.04 --> 124.02000000000001
and this morning

121.32 --> 126.77999999999999
it's all clouded up

124.02 --> 128.399
and sometimes big dark gray clouds come

126.78 --> 131.76
floating over

128.399 --> 133.68
pouring out buckets of water

131.76 --> 135.89999999999998
but other than that it's not actually

133.68 --> 140.9
really cold

135.9 --> 140.9
why it's not warm but it's it's not cold

141.18 --> 147.59900000000002
it is very moist

144.06 --> 151.86
no wind barely any

147.599 --> 154.61999999999998
right but yeah the plants are surely

151.86 --> 157.519
gonna get plenty of water

154.62 --> 157.519
in these days

158.94 --> 161.3
so

162.239 --> 171.739
it's Monday the 17th of May 2021

169.019 --> 171.739
ah

171.9 --> 177.12
right yeah one reason I had to get some

174.9 --> 178.20000000000002
groceries is because I was straight out

177.12 --> 180.84
of tea

178.2 --> 182.33999999999997
and I didn't want to do a uh well in

180.84 --> 185.0
this case a one and a half hour show

182.34 --> 185.0
without tea

191.159 --> 196.319
also ha

193.62 --> 198.56
good old times sake I got an Illuminati

196.319 --> 198.56
Castle

198.659 --> 201.79999999999998
so kind of my breakfast

202.26 --> 204.98
ah

206.299 --> 210.92000000000002
and stocked up on vitamin D3

215.879 --> 218.54
so

220.34 --> 226.5
let's see yeah I stayed up pretty late

223.44 --> 229.56
yesterday part of the reason

226.5 --> 232.34
I'm also late

229.56 --> 232.34
uh

238.92 --> 244.98
all right so yesterday

241.459 --> 245.879
Flat Earth early bird show was was very

244.98 --> 248.72
good

245.879 --> 248.72
I liked it

249.0 --> 252.36
I didn't watch it back but I thought it

250.799 --> 254.64000000000001
was good anyway

252.36 --> 256.73900000000003
uh

254.64 --> 260.15999999999997
right yeah Flat Earth debates from

256.739 --> 262.62
Friday was also a lot of fun

260.16 --> 265.46000000000004
I remember because it was there and was

262.62 --> 265.46
good to hear it back

266.1 --> 270.54
it's a lot of playing around but that's

268.62 --> 272.759
that's just a whole lot of fun to do

270.54 --> 275.699
that uh

272.759 --> 278.699
right later Dell also went live beyond

275.699 --> 281.46000000000004
the imaginary curve it was also just in

278.699 --> 283.32
his own way being very

281.46 --> 284.78
well spiritual he wouldn't call it

283.32 --> 288.0
spiritual

284.78 --> 291.479
but more like philosophical

288.0 --> 293.46
if you if you can really tune into the

291.479 --> 295.199
way that he talks because it is very

293.46 --> 297.84
Scottish

295.199 --> 300.06
and it's different but yeah if you can

297.84 --> 303.23999999999995
tune into that you you'll notice that

300.06 --> 306.74
the guy is definitely

303.24 --> 306.74
has senses

307.199 --> 312.18
and he picks up on a lock and he learns

309.419 --> 314.52
a lot and it's interesting to listen to

312.18 --> 317.0
his interpretation of everything that's

314.52 --> 317.0
going down

317.699 --> 320.36
uh

320.94 --> 324.78
right

322.22 --> 328.199
uh other than that it pretty much stuck

324.78 --> 330.479
to playing games

328.199 --> 333.199
and

330.479 --> 333.199
oh yeah

334.86 --> 340.68
I watched like the the first half of Ace

337.62 --> 344.0
Ventura the second movie God it's

340.68 --> 344.0
brings back memories

344.699 --> 349.08000000000004
even back then I thought it was

346.199 --> 351.41900000000004
hilarious and now looking at it again

349.08 --> 353.82
especially with all the psychological

351.419 --> 356.12
knowledge I've attained it's even more

353.82 --> 356.12
funny

357.9 --> 363.17999999999995
there's so much Mania in Jim Carrey's

360.96 --> 365.69899999999996
character there it's it is really very

363.18 --> 367.88
entertaining

365.699 --> 367.88
foreign

372.539 --> 375.44
see what else

378.0 --> 380.84
all right

382.86 --> 388.86
yeah yeah I cashed in on some

386.46 --> 390.84
well cashed in is a big word I exchanged

388.86 --> 394.86
some of the

390.84 --> 396.17999999999995
GTI currency thing

394.86 --> 398.88
and

396.18 --> 401.16
yeah that went through pretty quick so

398.88 --> 405.259
I'm kind of waiting for the right moment

401.16 --> 405.259
to exchange it into something else

406.5 --> 412.8
so that's fun to see that that's there's

409.8 --> 415.62
some movement in there now yeah I have

412.8 --> 417.84000000000003
to deal with the crypto stuff

415.62 --> 420.5
but yeah I got some guidance from my dad

417.84 --> 420.5
too and

420.84 --> 424.4
I'll see where that leads

424.68 --> 427.52
uh

428.88 --> 432.62
right so where is everybody

436.08 --> 441.3
huh

437.699 --> 441.3
right anyway

471.72 --> 478.44000000000005
hey Here We Go Again first in chat

475.62 --> 480.05
stop with traffic in my rest ahead

478.44 --> 483.11899999999997
hello

480.05 --> 483.119
[Music]

504.12 --> 509.419
hey Cameron Kamikaze Gilmore good to see

506.819 --> 509.41900000000004
you in chat

510.419 --> 517.029
again sorry for starting so late

513.48 --> 517.029
[Music]

517.919 --> 522.3
definitely not gonna make a habit of

519.779 --> 524.82
that but yeah in this the recent few

522.3 --> 526.9799999999999
days it's been so rainy it's really

524.82 --> 528.72
to carefully pick a moment to do my

526.98 --> 530.519
groceries otherwise when I get back I

528.72 --> 533.519
will be so soaked it'll take like a half

530.519 --> 536.839
an hour to dry out because when it rains

533.519 --> 536.839
it really pours hard

537.08 --> 542.36
hey Neil Constantino good see you

577.92 --> 583.76
oh wow all right that sounds nice rest

581.339 --> 583.7600000000001
hat

585.54 --> 590.779
is that your breakfast or have you been

587.82 --> 590.779
up very late again

600.66 --> 608.1
anyone else buffering like Matt

603.36 --> 612.779
hmm well currently my you YouTube

608.1 --> 615.12
input is not delayed for a change

612.779 --> 616.8
usually on my side it's very delayed I

615.12 --> 619.82
have to constantly scroll the YouTube

616.8 --> 619.8199999999999
video forward

620.64 --> 624.959
but not right now hmm

631.32 --> 634.6400000000001
hello Pat V

638.459 --> 641.06
huh

648.72 --> 653.9590000000001
got up at 8 pm

651.12 --> 653.9590000000001
wow

659.64 --> 663.62
that's a pretty crazy Rhythm dude

665.339 --> 671.7600000000001
I I would try to basically uh what does

668.459 --> 673.5
it push it even for like keep pushing it

671.76 --> 675.899
until it's kind of back to normal and

673.5 --> 678.48
then literally try to

675.899 --> 681.42
pin it down so that it'll stay like that

678.48 --> 684.2
because such late rhythms is not healthy

681.42 --> 684.1999999999999
for nobody

685.8 --> 689.519
and you're missing a whole bunch of

687.48 --> 692.22
daylight that way so

689.519 --> 694.98
anyway I've had plenty of those times

692.22 --> 697.76
right in the past especially 10 years

694.98 --> 697.76
ago and such

700.86 --> 707.839
rather more than 10 years that that kind

703.44 --> 707.839
of stop when I met my ex-girlfriend

709.98 --> 715.98
although like in 2015 and such I had

713.519 --> 720.019
plenty of those days as well

715.98 --> 720.019
before I started doing my own channel

723.899 --> 728.639
I have

726.18 --> 731.12
fan and melatonin arriving today all

728.639 --> 731.12
right cool

734.579 --> 741.18
all right also try some magnesium

738.42 --> 744.7199999999999
it's it's funny because I noticed that

741.18 --> 748.1389999999999
Alex Jones on his in his store

744.72 --> 749.639
they open up magnesium like magnesium

748.139 --> 752.22
exclusive

749.639 --> 754.139
some product so they apparently took

752.22 --> 757.74
notice of that too remember it's been

754.139 --> 759.899
like a couple of months ago that I told

757.74 --> 762.42
everybody like hey yeah I just went to

759.899 --> 764.399
the store I saw this and I just thought

762.42 --> 765.42
I have to have it I don't I didn't even

764.399 --> 767.94
know

765.42 --> 772.139
for sure why it's just that I looked at

767.94 --> 774.9590000000001
it and my spirit said you must get this

772.139 --> 778.5600000000001
magnesium citrate powder and it's pretty

774.959 --> 782.5189999999999
cheap like this this thing I could

778.56 --> 785.6389999999999
barely take anything out of it every go

782.519 --> 787.98
and this thing is yeah gonna last for a

785.639 --> 790.44
very long time

787.98 --> 793.139
and it's been great

790.44 --> 795.1800000000001
and apparently yeah

793.139 --> 797.399
that's Jones and his new product is like

795.18 --> 799.62
oh look at what it can do

797.399 --> 802.279
including like

799.62 --> 802.279
sleep assist

802.32 --> 808.139
it relaxes all kinds of things it helps

804.959 --> 811.279
in all kinds of processes

808.139 --> 811.279
so that's kind of funny

811.44 --> 815.899
I almost feel like I started it of

813.36 --> 815.899
course I didn't

823.32 --> 829.38
and wild dreams right you have to be

826.68 --> 831.54
very subtle like I take

829.38 --> 833.1
and what's yeah

831.54 --> 835.9399999999999
I know

833.1 --> 835.94
I know

837.72 --> 842.5790000000001
I have plenty of girlfriends on the

840.6 --> 845.0400000000001
other side right now

842.579 --> 849.2399999999999
or rather like just figuring out

845.04 --> 852.899
potential future wives that I hope like

849.24 --> 855.0
it's weird but it's been yeah it is

852.899 --> 856.56
quite

855.0 --> 858.48
nice

856.56 --> 862.199
it's funnily enough it does in an

858.48 --> 863.399
indirect way kind of boost my confidence

862.199 --> 865.62
weird

863.399 --> 867.72
but it's also because I don't basically

865.62 --> 870.779
latch on whatever's happening in the

867.72 --> 872.519
dream to kind of get like sex addicted

870.779 --> 875.12
or anything now I actually use it for

872.519 --> 875.12
the opposite

876.12 --> 880.199
it's funny

877.62 --> 883.68
like you would hold off in the real

880.199 --> 885.7199999999999
world to build tension and all that in

883.68 --> 887.9399999999999
the right way I'm doing that in my

885.72 --> 890.9590000000001
dreams too so I'm kind of using these

887.94 --> 894.7790000000001
dreams is as trading

890.959 --> 897.7399999999999
yeah a good serving good to see you

894.779 --> 897.74
Logan's Run

902.76 --> 908.76
sign you up for some magnesium oh dear

905.399 --> 912.26
yeah it's it's not a squirting drug

908.76 --> 912.26
or well I guess it could be

923.16 --> 926.06
foreign

928.76 --> 931.899
[Music]

971.18 --> 977.519
like it's not just

974.399 --> 978.6
the substances to get to sleep though

977.519 --> 981.54
right

978.6 --> 984.6
what really keeps people like you up

981.54 --> 985.92
this late and myself included when I get

984.6 --> 988.8000000000001
like that

985.92 --> 992.759
is really our own personal will because

988.8 --> 993.68
eventually it really does come down that

992.759 --> 996.1800000000001
through

993.68 --> 999.3
whatever's inside

996.18 --> 1002.12
you don't want to go to sleep until you

999.3 --> 1003.8
get hit by like a blanket and then

1002.12 --> 1006.98
suddenly like okay now I have to go to

1003.8 --> 1008.3599999999999
sleep right but it is your own will that

1006.98 --> 1011.54
keeps you up

1008.36 --> 1014.24
so the only way to really break food is

1011.54 --> 1016.399
to just decide like I'm going to bed now

1014.24 --> 1019.6
I'm going to sleep and then it's like oh

1016.399 --> 1019.6
almost like you

1019.82 --> 1023.839
like when you would have a little kid

1021.38 --> 1025.76
and they are like no and I'm awake and

1023.839 --> 1026.959
bouncy and like no you have to go to bed

1025.76 --> 1029.24
now

1026.959 --> 1031.48
right but you have to do that to

1029.24 --> 1031.48
yourself

1032.419 --> 1037.88
and when you that inner part of you

1035.24 --> 1040.4
doesn't then start rebelling and nagging

1037.88 --> 1042.679
on you

1040.4 --> 1045.26
you have to get a good

1042.679 --> 1047.0590000000002
obedient relationship with that part of

1045.26 --> 1049.34
yourself

1047.059 --> 1052.16
and you can just say like okay yeah I

1049.34 --> 1054.02
know you want that

1052.16 --> 1056.48
it's better if I just go to bed right

1054.02 --> 1060.62
now and whatever I want to do right now

1056.48 --> 1062.059
to stay up I could do that tomorrow

1060.62 --> 1065.86
earlier

1062.059 --> 1068.96
if necessary or something else

1065.86 --> 1071.78
right the things that you really want to

1068.96 --> 1072.679
do and keep keeping yourself up in the

1071.78 --> 1075.08
process

1072.679 --> 1078.02
you don't have to keep up

1075.08 --> 1078.98
to do that you can just do it a little

1078.02 --> 1082.78
later

1078.98 --> 1082.78
after having a good night's sleep

1082.88 --> 1087.94
anyway

1084.98 --> 1087.94
hmm

1104.9 --> 1109.539
right

1107.36 --> 1109.539
right

1127.24 --> 1132.4
so yeah what if you guys gal's been up

1130.22 --> 1132.4
to

1132.5 --> 1135.88
mostly guys right now

1147.559 --> 1154.8999999999999
all right did anybody hear that

1149.9 --> 1154.9
hilarious clip that Nathan dug up

1155.299 --> 1159.44
I I do think that it might have been

1157.16 --> 1163.16
edited though but not by him somebody

1159.44 --> 1166.1000000000001
else then send it sent

1163.16 --> 1168.38
that recording to Nathan but Nathan did

1166.1 --> 1171.82
like Premiere it

1168.38 --> 1171.8200000000002
where rumpus just

1171.98 --> 1176.419
seems very FL it seemed very fluid but

1174.799 --> 1178.039
he said a whole bunch of things that

1176.419 --> 1180.2800000000002
were just like oh my God what are you

1178.039 --> 1180.28
doing

1180.62 --> 1184.0
it was quite hilarious

1243.799 --> 1246.94
and then

1285.559 --> 1290.0
they're so smart with their intelligence

1287.48 --> 1291.559
well they it's more gaslighting though

1290.0 --> 1293.9
right

1291.559 --> 1296.4189999999999
because they're not really that

1293.9 --> 1300.44
intelligent they're intelligent enough

1296.419 --> 1302.24
to mechanically deal with all this

1300.44 --> 1305.1200000000001
in their own way

1302.24 --> 1307.52
but they're just there's it's partially

1305.12 --> 1310.12
it's gaslighting right and originally

1307.52 --> 1312.74
that gaslighting is meant for the

1310.12 --> 1315.26
unsuspecting public

1312.74 --> 1317.0
that might hear it that doesn't know too

1315.26 --> 1319.4
much about it

1317.0 --> 1321.32
they may be yeah well like okay well

1319.4 --> 1322.46
this guy seems to know what he's talking

1321.32 --> 1325.22
about

1322.46 --> 1328.1000000000001
he speaks eloquent enough and he's very

1325.22 --> 1332.1200000000001
confident right so that's gaslighting

1328.1 --> 1333.86
the public but if that doesn't work like

1332.12 --> 1335.7199999999998
with people from the Flat Earth debates

1333.86 --> 1338.539
for example

1335.72 --> 1341.48
flat earthers that are well informed

1338.539 --> 1344.24
then that gaslighting will still have to

1341.48 --> 1348.02
be kept up for in case some unsuspecting

1344.24 --> 1351.64
person might be listening to it but also

1348.02 --> 1351.6399999999999
it gains another function

1351.7 --> 1356.059
gaslighting yourself

1353.6 --> 1357.86
this is something that a lot of Ballers

1356.059 --> 1361.76
do

1357.86 --> 1364.58
because when they fail when they stumble

1361.76 --> 1367.34
in their reasoning in their arguments

1364.58 --> 1370.1
then they have to keep it up and they

1367.34 --> 1372.9189999999999
yeah with lack often

1370.1 --> 1376.1
of an audience that's unsuspecting they

1372.919 --> 1378.38
end up gaslighting themselves

1376.1 --> 1380.84
so basically

1378.38 --> 1384.0800000000002
still believe they're smart

1380.84 --> 1386.32
right despite their total failure in the

1384.08 --> 1386.32
moment

1386.6 --> 1389.8999999999999
so they Bluff through it but they do the

1389.0 --> 1392.72
bluff

1389.9 --> 1395.659
also for themselves to maintain that

1392.72 --> 1399.64
level of confidence

1395.659 --> 1399.64
artificially boosted confidence

1414.799 --> 1417.58
foreign

1422.679 --> 1427.22
they do this all the time and I'm pretty

1425.36 --> 1430.539
sure also

1427.22 --> 1430.539
in rumpus's case

1431.179 --> 1436.279
that it's because naturally if he

1434.48 --> 1439.46
wouldn't uphold an attitude like that

1436.279 --> 1441.5
the guy is actually doesn't have a lot

1439.46 --> 1443.799
of natural confidence

1441.5 --> 1447.34
so for him it's probably been his social

1443.799 --> 1447.34
survival mechanism

1452.24 --> 1458.26
he uses intellect to artificially boost

1454.4 --> 1458.26
his own confidence in his composure

1459.74 --> 1465.799
because he it doesn't come natural

1463.94 --> 1468.799
I think he's a pretty sensitive guy

1465.799 --> 1471.3799999999999
really sounds kind of weird right but

1468.799 --> 1474.82
you never get to see it it's just that

1471.38 --> 1474.8200000000002
a sensitive guy could

1474.919 --> 1480.0800000000002
get to that position and then it makes

1477.559 --> 1483.76
sense the the energies and also the

1480.08 --> 1483.76
subtleties that are still in there

1494.83 --> 1497.9399999999998
[Music]

1501.32 --> 1503.98
yeah yeah yeah

1505.279 --> 1507.46
foreign

1516.62 --> 1523.34
good servant yeah Liars I get it Liars

1519.74 --> 1525.2
Liars oh they're also lies yeah but

1523.34 --> 1526.52
first and foremost they lie to

1525.2 --> 1529.8400000000001
themselves

1526.52 --> 1529.84
and everybody

1531.02 --> 1536.62
has moments where they lie to themselves

1533.179 --> 1536.6200000000001
it's unavoidable

1539.539 --> 1543.799
when

1540.919 --> 1547.9
a part of Ascension is recognizing it

1543.799 --> 1547.9
and then finding a way through

1548.84 --> 1552.3799999999999
to be able to effectively avoid doing

1551.299 --> 1556.1
that

1552.38 --> 1558.3200000000002
and resolve the issue why you

1556.1 --> 1560.1789999999999
got an Impulse to lie toward yourself

1558.32 --> 1561.4399999999998
towards yourself about it in the first

1560.179 --> 1563.8600000000001
place

1561.44 --> 1563.8600000000001
right

1570.919 --> 1574.0590000000002
hey tiny Womble

1580.18 --> 1583.5990000000002
[Music]

1591.62 --> 1596.08
a yellow good to see you

1597.7 --> 1601.0
what's this

1606.38 --> 1609.3400000000001
wow

1613.58 --> 1617.1789999999999
really

1615.32 --> 1619.6399999999999
did you hear that good servant

1617.179 --> 1622.0
apparently now you're not a good

1619.64 --> 1622.0
Christian

1630.62 --> 1634.0
that's really pathetic

1638.059 --> 1643.46
hey

1640.46 --> 1643.46
hmm

1645.08 --> 1649.82
yeah hello by the way the i-1864

1703.279 --> 1709.24
right yes come on Cameron coming guys

1705.919 --> 1709.24
again where I totally get that

1709.58 --> 1715.039
like it's still annoying right

1713.179 --> 1717.74
but really

1715.039 --> 1720.74
it's also tragic and this is kind of

1717.74 --> 1724.279
like how I see it too it it's to kind of

1720.74 --> 1726.08
take away from the personal agitation is

1724.279 --> 1728.659
to realize that they're mostly just

1726.08 --> 1731.1789999999999
doing that upholding the ACT

1728.659 --> 1733.22
to convince themselves they're

1731.179 --> 1736.419
gaslighting themselves

1733.22 --> 1736.419
right that's what I call it

1738.45 --> 1741.599
[Music]

1743.539 --> 1748.399
right they're acting

1746.299 --> 1752.059
it's an act

1748.399 --> 1754.039
and the primary person to convince is

1752.059 --> 1756.02
themselves

1754.039 --> 1758.12
right when they're in this failing

1756.02 --> 1759.62
position where they literally get no

1758.12 --> 1762.9799999999998
grip

1759.62 --> 1764.84
then they proceed to still uphold that

1762.98 --> 1766.279
image and the idea that they're in

1764.84 --> 1770.899
control and that they're on the right

1766.279 --> 1773.24
side to convince themselves now this to

1770.899 --> 1774.26
know that even as it happens that even

1773.24 --> 1779.799
as

1774.26 --> 1779.799
somebody is speaking verbally or in chat

1779.86 --> 1785.6
realizing that about them might help you

1783.08 --> 1789.08
to well not

1785.6 --> 1790.73
take it so personal not get annoyed by

1789.08 --> 1793.789
it so much

1790.73 --> 1793.789
[Music]

1798.26 --> 1804.8799999999999
ah

1800.899 --> 1804.8799999999999
all right good serving good to hear

1814.96 --> 1824.8990000000001
yes the i-1864 it is all a show biz

1820.58 --> 1826.34
but they are both actors and

1824.899 --> 1830.2399999999998
uh

1826.34 --> 1833.36
and the end their own public right

1830.24 --> 1836.539
it's like an acting club like a drama

1833.36 --> 1838.52
club it's very good comparison actually

1836.539 --> 1840.919
most people in drama club they like

1838.52 --> 1843.86
doing that not don't necessarily always

1840.919 --> 1846.38
work on live performances

1843.86 --> 1850.6
they just do their thing

1846.38 --> 1850.6000000000001
and all kinds of Dynamics happen

1850.88 --> 1855.7990000000002
so they're also doing it for themselves

1852.919 --> 1860.2990000000002
and each other right

1855.799 --> 1862.399
it's not like oh we all know it's fake

1860.299 --> 1864.86
we have to keep that a secret from the

1862.399 --> 1868.899
public no they are literally just doing

1864.86 --> 1868.899
it for each other and themselves as well

1880.279 --> 1883.279
wow

1886.1 --> 1890.539
yeah the jacked up

1888.5 --> 1893.419
chicks

1890.539 --> 1895.1

1895.1 --> 1900.4399999999998
adolescent or what is it a

1897.62 --> 1903.5
like a teen age face because then

1900.44 --> 1905.96
suddenly like like constantly jacked off

1903.5 --> 1908.419
from all sides come wanna pay a visit

1905.96 --> 1910.76
and then the parents get all like hey

1908.419 --> 1912.919
hey leave him alone

1910.76 --> 1914.84
even though they're not hostile but

1912.919 --> 1916.94

foreign

2413.68 --> 2423.04
is there a topic for today no not really

2418.24 --> 2426.22
iron Fe not any new topics from my side

2423.04 --> 2427.7799999999997
anyway but hey I am up for anything

2426.22 --> 2429.819
you know

2427.78 --> 2432.5400000000004
about whatever you like

2429.819 --> 2432.54
all directions

2456.64 --> 2461.0789999999997
I mean there's plenty happening out

2458.98 --> 2463.42
there in the world new things that are

2461.079 --> 2466.78
unfolding

2463.42 --> 2470.02
there's a lot of crypto movement

2466.78 --> 2473.94
and stuff happening Elon Musk getting

2470.02 --> 2473.94
all weird with Bitcoin and all that

2475.599 --> 2482.7400000000002
all about legality and law oh my God

2480.579 --> 2485.819
you mean the difference between actual

2482.74 --> 2485.819
law and policy

2488.5 --> 2493.2
all right well actually law is based on

2493.24 --> 2497.7999999999997
oh

2494.56 --> 2500.44
natural law constitutional law which are

2497.8 --> 2501.94
just very basic and everything else is

2500.44 --> 2505.9
pretty much

2501.94 --> 2510.76
using that as a foundation to figure out

2505.9 --> 2513.7000000000003
where the situation belongs based on it

2510.76 --> 2516.6400000000003
the Constitution and natural law

2513.7 --> 2521.0989999999997
right so

2516.64 --> 2521.0989999999997
if something is said you must do this

2521.74 --> 2529.319
you gotta see what is that

2524.5 --> 2529.319
does it match constitutional law

2530.68 --> 2537.04
and if it doesn't

2532.48 --> 2540.28
then it's very likely its policy they're

2537.04 --> 2543.88
not they can't really Force you but they

2540.28 --> 2545.44
can Bluff you into believing you have to

2543.88 --> 2548.56
take it

2545.44 --> 2551.38
and do it and follow it

2548.56 --> 2553.96
just to avoid the hassle really when it

2551.38 --> 2557.28
comes down to it

2553.96 --> 2557.28
and then it's policy

2560.46 --> 2568.839
policy is really work with the program

2564.339 --> 2571.18
law is no this you like you must or

2568.839 --> 2573.64
rather you're not allow or they are not

2571.18 --> 2575.98
whoever whatever change is happening is

2573.64 --> 2578.02
not really allowed

2575.98 --> 2580.06
by law

2578.02 --> 2583.02
so that's yeah that's the main

2580.06 --> 2583.02
difference between it

2584.859 --> 2590.2
yeah the sound is a bit dodgy iron

2587.74 --> 2592.7999999999997
26 but that's because I put on a noise

2590.2 --> 2592.7999999999997
gate because

2593.26 --> 2597.7200000000003
they're bowing the lawn although it

2594.819 --> 2597.72
seems that they're stuck

2617.14 --> 2622.79
turn it back to normal again

2620.5 --> 2625.829
foreign

2622.79 --> 2625.829
[Music]

2658.619 --> 2667.31
all right so now it's back to normal

2661.63 --> 2667.31
[Music]

2696.579 --> 2699.579
foreign

2730.66 --> 2734.22
yeah thank you many young

2735.339 --> 2740.2799999999997
sneezing mood maybe it's like the grass

2737.38 --> 2740.28
or something I don't know

2757.24 --> 2761.7
karma is going to bite their asses in

2759.46 --> 2761.7
the end

2762.22 --> 2766.1189999999997
hopefully

2763.9 --> 2768.099
there are certainly some people that are

2766.119 --> 2771.1600000000003
definitely gonna take the fall for it

2768.099 --> 2773.079
right because it is a conspiracy and

2771.16 --> 2774.46
when they started it they knew how it

2773.079 --> 2777.28
was going to end

2774.46 --> 2781.68
yet they decided to do it anyway so that

2777.28 --> 2781.6800000000003
means there's guaranteed to be

2781.8 --> 2786.4
pre-decided

2783.579 --> 2790.02
fall guys that are literally gonna take

2786.4 --> 2790.02
the blame onto them for it all

2791.619 --> 2796.0
like that's already been decided so

2794.14 --> 2798.7
they're like

2796.0 --> 2802.66
like people like Bill Gates and fauci

2798.7 --> 2805.24
they're basically the enablers

2802.66 --> 2807.48
they allow everybody to play into that

2805.24 --> 2807.4799999999996
system

2807.52 --> 2813.94
and then in the end when it all really

2809.74 --> 2817.18
comes out and Nuremberg

2813.94 --> 2821.92
2 happens and all that

2817.18 --> 2823.7799999999997
then they will basically take the fall

2821.92 --> 2826.92
they will get the main punishment I

2823.78 --> 2826.92
think that's what's gonna happen

2828.099 --> 2831.099
foreign

2891.46 --> 2897.819
what is eugenics oh

2894.819 --> 2897.819
foreign

2898.18 --> 2907.0
it's complicated

2901.3 --> 2907.0
but what it's become is just insane

2910.96 --> 2917.579
Eugenics originally was really

2914.38 --> 2917.579
kind of like a

2918.16 --> 2922.54
a system

2920.319 --> 2925.119
a system of thinking

2922.54 --> 2927.52
like how do you

2925.119 --> 2929.88
how do you keep your population under

2927.52 --> 2929.88
control

2929.92 --> 2937.8
and how do you prevent like extreme

2932.98 --> 2937.8
swings and unpredictable end results

2940.059 --> 2945.7000000000003
right and then on top of that indeed

2943.599 --> 2947.44
things like selective reading and like

2945.7 --> 2949.7799999999997
hey you could

2947.44 --> 2953.319
you could kind of like try to use

2949.78 --> 2955.92
ideology to enforce

2953.319 --> 2959.339
certain types of cross breeding

2955.92 --> 2959.339
selective reading

2959.559 --> 2965.3190000000004
and that was basically inspired even on

2962.2 --> 2967.7799999999997
the breeding of animals pets and horses

2965.319 --> 2969.52
and cows and all that because that's

2967.78 --> 2972.2200000000003
what happened to them too so they used

2969.52 --> 2974.02
that as a concept and I thought like

2972.22 --> 2975.3999999999996
yeah we could potentially do that with

2974.02 --> 2977.5
humans too

2975.4 --> 2979.8
and in the past

2977.5 --> 2982.119
those types of things have happened

2979.8 --> 2985.48
non-eugenics wise

2982.119 --> 2988.119
kind of like yeah certain people just do

2985.48 --> 2990.18
that like culturally and all that they

2988.119 --> 2993.88
follow a certain type of

2990.18 --> 2996.52
ideals in men and women

2993.88 --> 2998.559
and then the people that stand out the

2996.52 --> 3000.24
most with that they get rewarded and

2998.559 --> 3001.98
those that totally feel they get

3000.24 --> 3004.859
punished

3001.98 --> 3007.44
that's kind of the same system as

3004.859 --> 3009.0589999999997
selective breeding but Eugenics just

3007.44 --> 3012.5
kind of like took it to a more

3009.059 --> 3012.5
engineered perspective

3014.22 --> 3018.9599999999996
right so that's that is eugenics and

3017.28 --> 3022.8
then later

3018.96 --> 3025.559
it kind of turned into a death cult

3022.8 --> 3027.7200000000003
like the idea of people are destroying

3025.559 --> 3031.38
the Earth which is not true it's

3027.72 --> 3033.66
unrealistic it's like yeah they can

3031.38 --> 3035.76
but there's also plenty of people that

3033.66 --> 3038.0989999999997
are actually preventing more destruction

3035.76 --> 3041.8190000000004
than

3038.099 --> 3044.099
a lot of people would cause right and

3041.819 --> 3047.04
that's not taken into account so that's

3044.099 --> 3050.88
where where total lies come into the

3047.04 --> 3054.0
picture and it's oversimplified man bad

3050.88 --> 3055.98
man is only bad right and that's where

3054.0 --> 3058.4
it turns into a death cult that's where

3055.98 --> 3061.7
it turns into

3058.4 --> 3061.7000000000003
climate change

3063.619 --> 3071.28
Gaia Worship in the bad form like that

3068.819 --> 3076.319
man is bad

3071.28 --> 3080.5400000000004
type of weird ideology that that really

3076.319 --> 3080.54
only leads to the degeneration

3081.18 --> 3086.94
and actually do the damage right this is

3084.599 --> 3089.76
the most sickening

3086.94 --> 3092.76
but if technically ironic part of it all

3089.76 --> 3095.3390000000004
is that everything they say

3092.76 --> 3097.7400000000002
right now with the climate change and

3095.339 --> 3099.66
with people destroying the environment

3097.74 --> 3102.0589999999997
and oh

3099.66 --> 3104.94
we have to change the fuels and the

3102.059 --> 3107.099
pollution like everything they say

3104.94 --> 3109.8
everything

3107.099 --> 3111.42
and now talking about the overlords like

3109.8 --> 3113.76
the one with the media and that they're

3111.42 --> 3116.04
doing all the the new plans

3113.76 --> 3118.5
because there are real environmentalists

3116.04 --> 3120.72
that are well informed and that don't

3118.5 --> 3123.9
fall for this sort of [ __ ] they're

3120.72 --> 3126.0
actually like very burdened by that this

3123.9 --> 3128.839
happening the real environmentalists

3126.0 --> 3132.359
right everything they do

3128.839 --> 3135.359
globalists the eugenesis the the

3132.359 --> 3137.52
neo-marxist the the media corporate

3135.359 --> 3138.9
political conspiracy and the medical

3137.52 --> 3141.98
system

3138.9 --> 3145.8
as a separate thing about it too

3141.98 --> 3148.38
everything they say everything they say

3145.8 --> 3151.619
they try to say oh this is the problem

3148.38 --> 3153.44
you have to do something about it well

3151.619 --> 3159.7200000000003
the solution they offer

3153.44 --> 3161.46
all ways creates the problem they say is

3159.72 --> 3163.7999999999997
supposed to be prevented

3161.46 --> 3166.14
and that's a rule of fist I've

3163.8 --> 3168.2400000000002
discovered it's a perfect flip-flop

3166.14 --> 3171.54
reality

3168.24 --> 3174.1189999999997
they suggest a problem

3171.54 --> 3177.3
then they offer a solution

3174.119 --> 3181.6400000000003
but it's not even the classic method

3177.3 --> 3181.6400000000003
problem reaction solution no

3182.88 --> 3185.6600000000003
the problem

3186.359 --> 3189.0789999999997
is

3189.24 --> 3196.339
there yeah is the solution to the

3193.92 --> 3196.339
reaction

3197.28 --> 3201.6600000000003
say this is the problem

3199.74 --> 3202.9799999999996
then they offer you something to do

3201.66 --> 3206.7599999999998
about it

3202.98 --> 3209.16
then you cause the problem

3206.76 --> 3211.26
that they warned about and that's what

3209.16 --> 3213.72
they're doing that is like the total

3211.26 --> 3217.26
devil system that's the Reversed World

3213.72 --> 3221.2799999999997
mechanism that's the Beast system

3217.26 --> 3224.0400000000004
in in its most concise that's what makes

3221.28 --> 3225.42
such a thing the Beast

3224.04 --> 3227.7
right

3225.42 --> 3230.52
it's not by accident every time this

3227.7 --> 3232.6189999999997
happens they offer you they say oh be

3230.52 --> 3235.559
careful about this

3232.619 --> 3237.3
then da offer a solution then think

3235.559 --> 3240.2400000000002
about it think about the solution get

3237.3 --> 3242.099
real don't let be indoctrinated and then

3240.24 --> 3245.7799999999997
you will see

3242.099 --> 3249.1800000000003
what they say you must do will actually

3245.78 --> 3252.3590000000004
cause the problem

3249.18 --> 3253.68
that they tell you needs to be avoided

3252.359 --> 3258.7799999999997
right

3253.68 --> 3262.319
hyper ironic but but on purpose

3258.78 --> 3264.9
it is is a heavy gaslighting like really

3262.319 --> 3268.4
heavy spell casting that way very

3264.9 --> 3268.4
devilish very evil

3277.619 --> 3281.299
so I hope that the

3281.46 --> 3284.66
take that to heart

3285.78 --> 3289.3390000000004
think about it compare it

3290.46 --> 3296.2200000000003
you know the Beast system the real B

3292.799 --> 3296.22
system creates

3297.0 --> 3299.9
the problem

3300.059 --> 3305.3390000000004
by

3302.54 --> 3307.859
suggesting you do certain things to

3305.339 --> 3311.839
solve that problem or prevent it when it

3307.859 --> 3311.839
will actually cause that problem

3314.64 --> 3319.74
right so where before that problem was

3316.92 --> 3321.0
not there because they made it into a

3319.74 --> 3324.1189999999997
problem

3321.0 --> 3327.0
and make manipulate everybody to do

3324.119 --> 3331.099
something about it that's how the

3327.0 --> 3331.099
problem is caused

3336.18 --> 3340.04
foreign

3338.27 --> 3343.44
[Music]

3340.04 --> 3346.5
is you being convinced

3343.44 --> 3350.119
and then making it a problem

3346.5 --> 3350.119
that's the problem

3356.22 --> 3361.64
what problem any problem

3358.74 --> 3361.64
climate change

3362.18 --> 3366.54
overpopulation

3363.9 --> 3370.2000000000003
like even with overpopulation you know

3366.54 --> 3373.859
because it's so it like over the 100

3370.2 --> 3375.839
years there have been studies even yeah

3373.859 --> 3379.0789999999997
within Eugenics that

3375.839 --> 3380.46
if you keep on attacking groups of

3379.079 --> 3383.3390000000004
people

3380.46 --> 3387.44
they will adapt and if you keep killing

3383.339 --> 3387.44
off people they will

3387.78 --> 3393.9
it just happens they will start to

3391.28 --> 3396.059
reproduce more

3393.9 --> 3398.839
especially if you do it for a very

3396.059 --> 3398.8390000000004
prolonged time

3400.68 --> 3407.48
right the best way to stabilize a

3403.02 --> 3407.48
population is by stopping to attack them

3410.16 --> 3414.54
and the best way to ruin a population is

3413.099 --> 3417.54
by

3414.54 --> 3420.9
forcefully helping them out

3417.54 --> 3423.0589999999997
so that they then start to lean on that

3420.9 --> 3425.839
helping out and actually lose their

3423.059 --> 3425.8390000000004
self-sufficiency

3426.599 --> 3433.319
and by attacking a group

3430.099 --> 3436.619
you force them to strengthen themselves

3433.319 --> 3439.2599999999998
find more Resolve stay more real or be

3436.619 --> 3441.2400000000002
obliterated

3439.26 --> 3444.26
and then you actually strengthen their

3441.24 --> 3444.2599999999998
Spirit by the attack

3449.88 --> 3455.099
yeah the best way to ruin a country is

3451.98 --> 3458.04
force multiculturalism well what it does

3455.099 --> 3460.319
is yes it does apps it does a lot of

3458.04 --> 3463.5589999999997
damage but

3460.319 --> 3466.579
the people that realize it they become

3463.559 --> 3466.579
more strengthened

3467.22 --> 3471.18
by

3469.02 --> 3473.7
by that knowledge and by going through

3471.18 --> 3476.16
it and they will be

3473.7 --> 3478.9199999999996
where before it seems just common sense

3476.16 --> 3482.7599999999998
they will become obsessed with

3478.92 --> 3484.859
maintaining their group status like this

3482.76 --> 3486.5400000000004
the of the entire group that it is a

3484.859 --> 3489.0
group that there is cohesion that there

3486.54 --> 3491.04
is a spirit of that group whatever it is

3489.0 --> 3493.44
you know whether it's your country

3491.04 --> 3495.66
or your tribe

3493.44 --> 3498.78
or

3495.66 --> 3502.04
the spoken language group anything can

3498.78 --> 3502.0400000000004
it be any group right

3522.78 --> 3530.059
hmm yes Mother Salim hello by the way

3526.92 --> 3530.059
and George Sanford

3547.88 --> 3554.599
right so here comes the weird part with

3551.579 --> 3554.599
Eugenics right

3555.299 --> 3561.119
just like

3557.359 --> 3563.94
basic old leftism right remember old

3561.119 --> 3566.819
leftism it's all far gone it's all went

3563.94 --> 3570.48
way over the line into demonic territory

3566.819 --> 3572.819
now old leftism that was there was

3570.48 --> 3574.619
something good about it right well let

3572.819 --> 3577.4
me tell you

3574.619 --> 3581.099
there is something sensible about

3577.4 --> 3583.14
considering like thinking about it

3581.099 --> 3584.76
weighing out

3583.14 --> 3586.02
eugenics

3584.76 --> 3589.079
but

3586.02 --> 3591.24
it's grown so out of control what's been

3589.079 --> 3592.38
built on top of this by really dark

3591.24 --> 3594.7799999999997
people

3592.38 --> 3596.28
that basically the words become very

3594.78 --> 3599.28
tainted

3596.28 --> 3602.3390000000004
so anything Eugenics now becomes evil

3599.28 --> 3604.7400000000002
because of all the associations but the

3602.339 --> 3607.799
original idea

3604.74 --> 3611.04
was actually

3607.799 --> 3614.04
kind of halfway sensible it was

3611.04 --> 3616.52
something to consider

3614.04 --> 3616.52
right

3618.599 --> 3621.6800000000003
but yeah that's

3621.72 --> 3628.5589999999997
because they're like

3624.2 --> 3631.319
what it caused in people in rulers also

3628.559 --> 3633.9
is to just have an oversight over what

3631.319 --> 3636.359
it means to have a small or a big

3633.9 --> 3638.46
population what the culture was like

3636.359 --> 3640.92
what that would do right

3638.46 --> 3642.359
Eugenics was a lot about social

3640.92 --> 3644.64
engineering

3642.359 --> 3647.04
and not necessarily

3644.64 --> 3650.46
to destroy them

3647.04 --> 3654.119
right originally it was actually to try

3650.46 --> 3656.28
to perf yeah to improve upon it

3654.119 --> 3659.28
sensibly

3656.28 --> 3662.579
it's like a managing strategies

3659.28 --> 3665.579
that's what Eugenics really was

3662.579 --> 3669.599
and then yeah then satanists and

3665.579 --> 3671.4
occultists and all kinds of freaks

3669.599 --> 3674.3590000000004
got a grip on it and basically

3671.4 --> 3677.94
assimilated it and then turned it into

3674.359 --> 3680.22
just mechanisms for how to destroy

3677.94 --> 3682.02
people's minds and

3680.22 --> 3684.359
everything

3682.02 --> 3686.7599999999998
how to make people destroy themselves

3684.359 --> 3688.98
that's what it's become but that's not

3686.76 --> 3691.7400000000002
what it was

3688.98 --> 3694.14
that's what they turn it into

3691.74 --> 3697.0789999999997
again that's what evil does they take

3694.14 --> 3701.46
things and then they corrupt it

3697.079 --> 3703.799
every time so many symbols and things

3701.46 --> 3705.299
have been corrupted at one point or

3703.799 --> 3707.16
another and then what are you gonna do

3705.299 --> 3710.16
you're gonna just look at the corrupted

3707.16 --> 3712.68
part and say that is what that is there

3710.16 --> 3714.839
is only the evil thing left

3712.68 --> 3717.24
or are you actually going to try to

3714.839 --> 3719.88
remember it for what it really was and

3717.24 --> 3721.6189999999997
then realize what happened to it how it

3719.88 --> 3724.02
happened and what you're left with

3721.619 --> 3726.619
because of it and is there a way to

3724.02 --> 3731.339
basically cut all that garbage off there

3726.619 --> 3732.96
restore it maybe and that counts for a

3731.339 --> 3736.5789999999997
whole bunch of things

3732.96 --> 3736.579
a whole bunch of things

3739.859 --> 3746.339
right like in even things like uh the

3744.359 --> 3749.2799999999997
allopathic medical system

3746.339 --> 3753.74
it's basically the same thing it started

3749.28 --> 3753.7400000000002
out as really pragmatic emergency

3754.02 --> 3757.98
how do you deal

3755.819 --> 3759.599
with like extreme situation physically

3757.98 --> 3762.119
how do you restore it how do you keep

3759.599 --> 3764.88
everything in balance that was it

3762.119 --> 3767.819
but then it became this like no that's

3764.88 --> 3769.6800000000003
the only thing you should do system and

3767.819 --> 3771.42
everything else must be excluded and

3769.68 --> 3775.2
that's how it corrupted

3771.42 --> 3777.7200000000003
right it didn't start out bad

3775.2 --> 3780.8999999999996
when it became bad Rockefeller

3777.72 --> 3783.359
Foundation started to take it

3780.9 --> 3786.1800000000003
build the Red Cross and then established

3783.359 --> 3789.359
a medical board and now it has to be

3786.18 --> 3790.859
allopathic right that's when it turned

3789.359 --> 3793.0789999999997
dark

3790.859 --> 3795.5
but before that it was simply a

3793.079 --> 3795.5
discipline

3796.319 --> 3801.72
right

3798.0 --> 3805.079
and and the same goes with vaccinations

3801.72 --> 3808.0789999999997
it started out as an honest experiment

3805.079 --> 3810.539
test like hey how does this work

3808.079 --> 3813.42
and it's pretty primitive

3810.539 --> 3815.88
but yeah there was something to it right

3813.42 --> 3818.099
now whether that's really the way you

3815.88 --> 3820.559
want to resolve those issues associated

3818.099 --> 3824.539
with it is another matter but the thing

3820.559 --> 3824.539
is it started out as just the

3824.64 --> 3831.839
a system of

3826.38 --> 3834.6600000000003
using yeah an experiment like using yes

3831.839 --> 3835.859
tests to figure out how can you resolve

3834.66 --> 3838.2599999999998
this

3835.859 --> 3841.02
started out honest and now it's become

3838.26 --> 3842.94
like oh how can we fool everybody that

3841.02 --> 3843.9
there's this threat into poisoning

3842.94 --> 3847.44
themselves

3843.9 --> 3848.339
right that's not what Louis Pasteur had

3847.44 --> 3850.559
in mind

3848.339 --> 3852.9
I hope so at least I don't know really

3850.559 --> 3856.02
what the guy was like

3852.9 --> 3859.619
maybe he did secretly have that in mind

3856.02 --> 3860.819
but I'm going to assume not the worst

3859.619 --> 3862.44
right

3860.819 --> 3865.14
because

3862.44 --> 3868.5
things get invented then they get it

3865.14 --> 3872.819
gets corrupted right even in

3868.5 --> 3875.039
in science like Newton Newton figured

3872.819 --> 3877.2
out a mechanism of how to deal with

3875.039 --> 3880.8590000000004
forces

3877.2 --> 3883.02
yeah he excluded the gas in his models

3880.859 --> 3886.859
and he had just had this system and then

3883.02 --> 3888.839
he was lured into figuring out like hey

3886.859 --> 3891.359
what if the Earth was a ball how would

3888.839 --> 3894.9
my Force mechanisms work and what would

3891.359 --> 3897.48
you get in gravitational pull but he

3894.9 --> 3900.6600000000003
never claimed the hypothesis he was an

3897.48 --> 3903.78
honorable man I think for the most part

3900.66 --> 3907.2
right so he figured out something just

3903.78 --> 3909.059
like having fun and just Curiosities and

3907.2 --> 3910.3799999999997
let's see if I can calculate it and see

3909.059 --> 3913.1400000000003
if I can do it

3910.38 --> 3916.619
and then now he's become the Cornerstone

3913.14 --> 3919.98
of like a dark mind control reversed

3916.619 --> 3922.7000000000003
World system that lies Newton never

3919.98 --> 3922.7
wanted that

3922.799 --> 3928.92
I'm pretty sure he didn't want that

3924.9 --> 3930.96
right so it didn't start out bad but

3928.92 --> 3934.7400000000002
then over time

3930.96 --> 3937.68
evil people took it and corrupted it put

3934.74 --> 3940.6189999999997
it into a corrupted mechanism to attack

3937.68 --> 3943.2599999999998
people with and that's what happens

3940.619 --> 3945.6600000000003
think good things come into being

3943.26 --> 3948.26
and then they get assimilated into the

3945.66 --> 3948.2599999999998
Beast system

3948.78 --> 3954.1800000000003
and then eventually you only get to see

3951.66 --> 3956.22
the Beast system part of it and not

3954.18 --> 3959.0989999999997
where it came from

3956.22 --> 3961.2
and that makes you perhaps think you

3959.099 --> 3963.42
might become Spellbound into thinking

3961.2 --> 3965.16
everything is evil because everything is

3963.42 --> 3967.92
in the peace system

3965.16 --> 3970.02
and it's all being used for bad

3967.92 --> 3972.539
well

3970.02 --> 3975.18
if you do that then you're only staring

3972.539 --> 3978.5
at the Beast and not at where the Beast

3975.18 --> 3978.5
got all his stuff from

3980.819 --> 3983.819
right

3990.24 --> 3994.3799999999997
and now even the corruption process of

3993.48 --> 3996.02
this

3994.38 --> 3998.6400000000003
has been

3996.02 --> 4001.78
refined to a direct mind control

3998.64 --> 4001.7799999999997
operation level

4002.059 --> 4007.1600000000003
as I started out this specific speech

4004.76 --> 4008.6600000000003
here this monologue

4007.16 --> 4012.859
now

4008.66 --> 4016.66
they literally conjure a problem

4012.859 --> 4020.0589999999997
tell you what to do to solve the problem

4016.66 --> 4024.02
knowingly design having designed it

4020.059 --> 4025.7000000000003
specifically to make you create that

4024.02 --> 4028.339
problem

4025.7 --> 4031.0389999999998
that you're supposedly helping to

4028.339 --> 4033.44
prevent or resolve

4031.039 --> 4036.26
right so even the the corruption

4033.44 --> 4038.78
assimilation has now been turned into a

4036.26 --> 4042.7400000000002
direct mind control interface mechanism

4038.78 --> 4045.6400000000003
literally assimilating people into it to

4042.74 --> 4045.64
create that problem

4068.18 --> 4074.0
yeah all right tiny Bumble okay good you

4071.539 --> 4076.6400000000003
survived yeah I remember you

4074.0 --> 4079.819
you said you were gonna take that

4076.64 --> 4082.16
I glad to hear you didn't have any bad

4079.819 --> 4084.68
side effects just don't do it anymore

4082.16 --> 4086.18
okay because they will push you to take

4084.68 --> 4088.46
a second one

4086.18 --> 4091.7599999999998
from what I've heard

4088.46 --> 4094.099
most of the actual damage is done at the

4091.76 --> 4096.339
second shot which is a different type of

4094.099 --> 4096.339
shot

4097.279 --> 4101.659000000001
that's where the most of the real damage

4099.5 --> 4103.839
is done so keep that in mind don't do it

4101.659 --> 4103.839
again

4120.56 --> 4125.659000000001
yeah magnets sticking to the VAC skin

4123.259 --> 4127.279
yeah I've heard I've seen video report

4125.659 --> 4130.42
about that yeah that's apparently

4127.279 --> 4130.42
happening foreign

4132.4 --> 4137.42
so you might be having like a genetic

4135.259 --> 4140.54
magnetic barcode

4137.42 --> 4143.359
where literally your cells are now

4140.54 --> 4144.44
slightly modified to send out a magnetic

4143.359 --> 4146.859
signal

4144.44 --> 4146.8589999999995
right

4148.1 --> 4155.96
I've heard talk about that system

4152.839 --> 4158.38
even a while ago so maybe that's what's

4155.96 --> 4158.38
in there

4174.679 --> 4180.859
seeking star water I don't think so

4178.219 --> 4183.819
no I don't I don't think people are

4180.859 --> 4183.819
getting placebos

4189.319 --> 4196.159000000001
I think that some of the direct

4191.38 --> 4199.28
operators are probably getting placebos

4196.159 --> 4201.379999999999
but it's not like oh a whole swath of

4199.28 --> 4203.36
people only get placebos I don't think

4201.38 --> 4205.6990000000005
so

4203.36 --> 4208.339999999999
because if that were the case then there

4205.699 --> 4210.919999999999
would be like groups

4208.34 --> 4213.92
even entire countries

4210.92 --> 4216.32
where supposedly a lot of people got it

4213.92 --> 4218.9800000000005
and nobody got any kind of side effect

4216.32 --> 4222.679
at all right if that starts to happen

4218.98 --> 4224.599999999999
like Yeah a hundred thousand or a

4222.679 --> 4227.3
million people took the vex

4224.6 --> 4231.1990000000005
and nobody of them got a single side

4227.3 --> 4233.06
effect right including magnetic thing on

4231.199 --> 4236.178999999999
their arm and whatever

4233.06 --> 4238.52
if that happened then I'd say okay in

4236.179 --> 4242.659
that location in that country in that

4238.52 --> 4245.0
City they probably got it only placebos

4242.659 --> 4249.879999999999
because otherwise there would absolutely

4245.0 --> 4249.88
be people having side effects or dying

4250.82 --> 4255.799999999999
but that doesn't seem to be happening

4252.92 --> 4258.34
and yeah famous people are not being

4255.8 --> 4258.34
spared

4259.219 --> 4263.6
right I've even read news articles that

4261.56 --> 4268.64
this

4263.6 --> 4273.820000000001
is one of the British nobility

4268.64 --> 4273.820000000001
is it princess Michael of Kent

4274.28 --> 4278.3
took the vax and had blood clots and

4277.34 --> 4281.8
[ __ ]

4278.3 --> 4281.8
so yeah

4281.9 --> 4287.96
I don't think so I it's not they all

4285.5 --> 4289.76
know about it and get the placebo I

4287.96 --> 4293.54
don't think so

4289.76 --> 4296.179
I think you underestimate how deeply

4293.54 --> 4299.719
the higher controllers

4296.179 --> 4301.64
the sitters on the Thrones of the Beast

4299.719 --> 4305.42
are actually

4301.64 --> 4308.360000000001
made to believe the [ __ ]

4305.42 --> 4310.28
themselves and participate in the cult

4308.36 --> 4313.12
rituals themselves I think you

4310.28 --> 4313.12
underestimated

4316.04 --> 4319.96
they're literally doing it

4320.12 --> 4325.78
they're mad they're trying to magically

4322.46 --> 4325.78
think their way through it

4328.48 --> 4331.5199999999995
[Music]

4333.739 --> 4338.9
avoid if you are a lizardness

4336.5 --> 4342.8
why avoid if you're anything I don't

4338.9 --> 4345.799999999999
think any formal life can take the facts

4342.8 --> 4348.1990000000005
without it having some negative effect

4345.8 --> 4350.06
like all the animals they tested it on

4348.199 --> 4352.04
all died

4350.06 --> 4355.900000000001
100 percent

4352.04 --> 4355.9
right so yeah

4356.06 --> 4359.14
just don't take it

4373.699 --> 4377.44
oh good servant no they are taking it

4376.58 --> 4381.28
too

4377.44 --> 4381.28
including the Grapplers

4385.94 --> 4391.28
like I don't know if you know but like

4388.4 --> 4394.96
Israel is the most Corona vaccinated

4391.28 --> 4394.96
country in the world right now

4399.14 --> 4403.96
right and really rich people

4404.54 --> 4409.54
take it too

4406.64 --> 4409.54
they do

4419.659 --> 4425.54
right so so don't jump to complete it's

4422.239 --> 4428.379999999999
not that easy oh God

4425.54 --> 4428.38
ah

4439.94 --> 4443.44
this gate back on

4467.84 --> 4474.32
what virus yeah there is no virus

4470.78 --> 4474.32
the i-8064

4474.86 --> 4479.36
I'd even

4477.08 --> 4482.48
I'm not afraid to go as far as to say

4479.36 --> 4485.78
that viruses according to the official

4482.48 --> 4488.718999999999
model don't exist at all

4485.78 --> 4491.599999999999
not saying that virus Associated

4488.719 --> 4493.94
diseases are not diseases or serious

4491.6 --> 4497.360000000001
conditions it's just that the theory

4493.94 --> 4499.82
about the virus that concerns it is not

4497.36 --> 4501.739
legitimate

4499.82 --> 4504.86
that's what I'm saying

4501.739 --> 4508.0599999999995
so there is no virus viruses are

4504.86 --> 4508.0599999999995
fictional Concepts

4508.76 --> 4513.679
there's exosomes there's a cleaning up

4510.92 --> 4515.2390000000005
mechanism but all viral bodies that are

4513.679 --> 4518.54
the bodies that are associated with

4515.239 --> 4521.239
virals are all spawned within the body

4518.54 --> 4524.3
and are like that capability is present

4521.239 --> 4527.659
at all time one can spawn

4524.3 --> 4531.56
viral particles the exosomes

4527.659 --> 4532.639999999999
without being in contact with anybody or

4531.56 --> 4536.2390000000005
anything

4532.64 --> 4539.900000000001
the body just conjures it up

4536.239 --> 4541.459999999999
it it's because it's a natural metabolic

4539.9 --> 4544.46
part of the body

4541.46 --> 4548.26
all forms of viruses

4544.46 --> 4548.26
it's just not what they say it is

4549.98 --> 4556.94
right so that's why I say Ovid is a

4555.02 --> 4559.34
condition

4556.94 --> 4562.04
it's not a disease it's especially not

4559.34 --> 4565.04
an infectious disease it's a condition

4562.04 --> 4566.36
yes the condition is real yes you can

4565.04 --> 4569.239
die

4566.36 --> 4572.12
in that condition especially if your

4569.239 --> 4573.5599999999995
body's in a bad State comorbidities as

4572.12 --> 4576.28
they call it

4573.56 --> 4580.1
it's not a disease and it's not

4576.28 --> 4583.54
infectious only way it's infectious

4580.1 --> 4586.52
is through psychosomatics

4583.54 --> 4590.54
psychosomatic sympathy

4586.52 --> 4593.540000000001
right you're nervous you're scared of

4590.54 --> 4595.4
being sick you notice people there being

4593.54 --> 4598.159
sick and they might like sneeze in your

4595.4 --> 4599.9
direction you might get so shocked by it

4598.159 --> 4602.42
that it may trigger

4599.9 --> 4605.9
there was sympathy like spiritual

4602.42 --> 4609.679
sympathy like you're taking it into you

4605.9 --> 4612.08
spiritually that may trigger your body

4609.679 --> 4614.0
to say okay we're gonna do this too

4612.08 --> 4615.38
we're gonna start that up because your

4614.0 --> 4616.94
body doesn't give a [ __ ] what you're

4615.38 --> 4618.9800000000005
afraid about your body's just gonna

4616.94 --> 4620.0599999999995
respond to like hey could we use a good

4618.98 --> 4621.98
cleanup

4620.06 --> 4624.320000000001
yeah

4621.98 --> 4627.08
let's do this and that's how you get

4624.32 --> 4630.5
sick not because you're infected because

4627.08 --> 4633.1
it's psychosomatically triggered

4630.5 --> 4633.1
right

4633.82 --> 4638.36
so yeah and the virus narrative rage is

4637.46 --> 4641.719
on

4638.36 --> 4644.62
oh the virus is not dangerous and nobody

4641.719 --> 4647.96
dies of it and

4644.62 --> 4651.26
look at the vaccine spreading a virus

4647.96 --> 4654.26
yeah they're still utilizing virus

4651.26 --> 4654.26
Theory

4654.679 --> 4661.1
in the developments even from the

4658.76 --> 4663.08
the anti-vaxxer side

4661.1 --> 4665.659000000001
they're still

4663.08 --> 4669.98
within their reasoning assuming viruses

4665.659 --> 4672.98
are real and hyping up fear about it

4669.98 --> 4675.259999999999
and then saying just don't use the

4672.98 --> 4676.94
vaccine as a solution to the virus that

4675.26 --> 4679.6990000000005
doesn't work which is technically

4676.94 --> 4681.08
correct from every perspective

4679.699 --> 4683.178999999999
right

4681.08 --> 4685.699
but then they might pose some other

4683.179 --> 4687.08
solution like oh you have to be very

4685.699 --> 4689.199
careful and take all the right

4687.08 --> 4692.78
supplements so you don't catch anything

4689.199 --> 4695.178999999999
right they're still using fear

4692.78 --> 4698.54
to sell products even though it might be

4695.179 --> 4703.04
a good product to have right I I have

4698.54 --> 4705.8
vitamin D3 I have zinc

4703.04 --> 4709.699
right I have vitamin C

4705.8 --> 4713.179
I'm just not oh no today might be the

4709.699 --> 4715.04
day that I might catch something oh I

4713.179 --> 4717.26
have to be afraid

4715.04 --> 4719.12
time it like oh is my alarm clock going

4717.26 --> 4723.34
off now I have to take this off no

4719.12 --> 4723.34
because that's a waste of time

4723.739 --> 4728.9
it's literally wasting my energy and

4726.14 --> 4732.400000000001
time panicking over something that that

4728.9 --> 4732.4
nobody should Panic about

4736.219 --> 4741.44
move it

4738.26 --> 4743.179
having a cold having the flu their

4741.44 --> 4746.36
conditions

4743.179 --> 4749.54
or condition it's a metabolic overhaul

4746.36 --> 4751.4
system starts to do all kinds of things

4749.54 --> 4753.32
yeah it's very unpleasant it might be

4751.4 --> 4757.46
painful

4753.32 --> 4759.5
it might distort your feeling the

4757.46 --> 4762.08
thinking capability even in the moment

4759.5 --> 4763.88
especially with a fever yeah it's very

4762.08 --> 4767.179
unpleasant

4763.88 --> 4770.659000000001
you're not getting invaded

4767.179 --> 4774.82
by an outside entity

4770.659 --> 4774.82
that conception is fiction

4774.98 --> 4780.259999999999
right I'm not saying that that's

4777.26 --> 4783.679
entirely impossible because yeah you can

4780.26 --> 4785.42
get like bacteria or whatever or even

4783.679 --> 4788.36
parasites

4785.42 --> 4792.08
say let you have a wound

4788.36 --> 4793.94
you don't treat that wound well yeah it

4792.08 --> 4796.94
can get infected can get pretty

4793.94 --> 4800.36
dangerous it can get gangrene all kinds

4796.94 --> 4803.36
of creepy [ __ ] if your body is in the

4800.36 --> 4805.46
condition where it's yeah it can't

4803.36 --> 4809.299999999999
defend against it because there are

4805.46 --> 4812.4800000000005
things out here to be defended against

4809.3 --> 4814.820000000001
but your body has natural systems to do

4812.48 --> 4817.218999999999
that if you have the right nutritions if

4814.82 --> 4818.48
you have the right Flora on your skin in

4817.219 --> 4821.26
your intestines

4818.48 --> 4825.44
then you can handle those outside

4821.26 --> 4828.679
Outsiders the illegal extra bodily

4825.44 --> 4830.36
aliens right that might come in they

4828.679 --> 4834.1
come in through your breathing system

4830.36 --> 4834.099999999999
through your food all the time

4836.3 --> 4844.159000000001
right so yes technically there can be a

4840.32 --> 4846.259999999999
minor Invasion from hostile bacteria but

4844.159 --> 4848.719
it only really starts to happen like

4846.26 --> 4852.320000000001
that if your body is in a weakened state

4848.719 --> 4854.3
if there's no proper border guards

4852.32 --> 4858.46
the skin at

4854.3 --> 4858.46
all the entrances of your body

4860.84 --> 4866.719
right bacteria is real not virus virus

4863.9 --> 4870.08
is a body inherent mechanism

4866.719 --> 4872.4800000000005
viruses are not living they are like a

4870.08 --> 4874.76
tool of the body

4872.48 --> 4877.4
they don't exist outside of the body

4874.76 --> 4881.42
they can't do anything outside of the

4877.4 --> 4882.5
body and when a viral particle enters

4881.42 --> 4885.38
the body

4882.5 --> 4888.08
it doesn't do anything

4885.38 --> 4889.28
because it's inanimate it doesn't do

4888.08 --> 4891.92
anything

4889.28 --> 4896.679
it just gets rounded up with the garbage

4891.92 --> 4896.679
and recycle like everything else

4909.8 --> 4915.860000000001
right and terrain theory explain this

4912.86 --> 4918.5
explains most of this terrain theory is

4915.86 --> 4922.36
really the key to getting a proper

4918.5 --> 4922.36
oversight of how this all works

4933.5 --> 4938.9
yeah well the I

4935.92 --> 4941.179
8064 look

4938.9 --> 4943.94
Hamas is

4941.179 --> 4946.6990000000005
like part of Israel

4943.94 --> 4949.699
they are like the most blatant

4946.699 --> 4951.5
controlled opposition

4949.699 --> 4954.678999999999
I've ever seen

4951.5 --> 4956.54
like they literally just are there

4954.679 --> 4960.26
inside

4956.54 --> 4964.159
keep control and to start up the war

4960.26 --> 4966.639
when it's necessary again

4964.159 --> 4966.638999999999
right

4968.239 --> 4971.44
that's what I think

4976.04 --> 4981.34
not even like that what is it again

4981.86 --> 4986.54
like in the past it might have actually

4983.96 --> 4989.179
been kind of legitimate and and really

4986.54 --> 4992.179
wanting to get to peace and then again

4989.179 --> 4995.54
Mubarak was assassinated

4992.179 --> 5000.36
and then that was just over

4995.54 --> 5000.36
was done no more it's over

5009.699 --> 5014.86
because I don't think Israel wants them

5012.699 --> 5017.0199999999995
it they just don't want peace they want

5014.86 --> 5019.299999999999
them to be permanently hostile so have

5017.02 --> 5021.88
an excuse to literally

5019.3 --> 5026.4400000000005
destroy everything about them

5021.88 --> 5030.2390000000005
and then take up it's a crazy strategy

5026.44 --> 5030.239
but that seems what they're doing

5033.159 --> 5038.98
like and what are a bunch of freaking

5034.96 --> 5040.0
bottle rockets gonna do anyway nothing

5038.98 --> 5043.599999999999
dude

5040.0 --> 5046.3
Israeli airstrikes just level entire

5043.6 --> 5048.34
giant building complexes

5046.3 --> 5049.78
just like that a bunch of freaking

5048.34 --> 5051.52
bottle rockets what are they gonna do

5049.78 --> 5055.86
break a window

5051.52 --> 5055.860000000001
make a hole in the wall somewhere oh

5057.65 --> 5061.42
[Music]

5067.48 --> 5074.259999999999
dude if the Israelis really were so

5071.5 --> 5078.52
afraid of baller Rockets

5074.26 --> 5081.9400000000005
but they would just have basic air

5078.52 --> 5083.620000000001
like missile defense systems like have

5081.94 --> 5086.08
very basic

5083.62 --> 5087.76
systems that literally shoot any ball of

5086.08 --> 5090.94
rocket from any

5087.76 --> 5093.34
Gaza location or whatever instantly none

5090.94 --> 5095.98
no bottle rocket would ever like even

5093.34 --> 5099.719
cross the border

5095.98 --> 5099.718999999999
right they don't do that

5099.82 --> 5105.34
makes no sense Israel has is like

5103.0 --> 5107.92
technical availability of like the most

5105.34 --> 5112.08
high-tech Weaponry in the world if they

5107.92 --> 5112.08
wanted to they just don't do it

5115.73 --> 5118.83
[Music]

5130.27 --> 5133.419000000001
[Music]

5141.46 --> 5145.659
all right

5143.199 --> 5148.12
so yeah I'm gonna round out the show

5145.659 --> 5149.98
it's been a little short but still

5148.12 --> 5151.9
interesting I got to put down a couple

5149.98 --> 5155.919999999999
of really good things

5151.9 --> 5159.699
even address the Israel situation

5155.92 --> 5162.88
ah don't get into trouble for that

5159.699 --> 5165.94
I'm just being honest man like I

5162.88 --> 5169.12
I'm just sick of the nonsense like I'm

5165.94 --> 5170.98
not like on a side at all I'm not gonna

5169.12 --> 5173.08
get carried away by the by the entire

5170.98 --> 5176.08
polarizing nature of it it's been going

5173.08 --> 5179.44
on my entire life that [ __ ]

5176.08 --> 5181.719
and everybody that gets caught up in it

5179.44 --> 5184.299999999999
one way or the other always gets into

5181.719 --> 5185.86
spiritual trouble I'm not gonna do it so

5184.3 --> 5187.3
I'll just be honest about everything

5185.86 --> 5189.46
about it

5187.3 --> 5192.179
not get carried away so I hope you

5189.46 --> 5192.179
appreciate it

5194.02 --> 5199.719
