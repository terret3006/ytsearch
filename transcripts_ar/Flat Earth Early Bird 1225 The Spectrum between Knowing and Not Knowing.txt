5.89 --> 37.43
[Music]

55.559 --> 61.28
good morning welcome to flat earth early

58.96 --> 63.6
bird number 1225

61.28 --> 65.68
i'm your host irwin and before we start

63.6 --> 68.4
the show please don't forget to share it

65.68 --> 70.47900000000001
on any platform you deem fit and if you

68.4 --> 72.479
haven't already subscribe to my channel

70.479 --> 74.56
and hit the bell notification so you

72.479 --> 76.4
know when i'm going live which is

74.56 --> 78.479
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

76.4 --> 81.43900000000001
weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam time in the

78.479 --> 83.439
weekend and please also do support me

81.439 --> 85.6
through the paypal patreon super chat

83.439 --> 88.88
and the membership system join button

85.6 --> 88.88
that'll be much appreciated

89.2 --> 94.07900000000001
you can always use it

91.68 --> 97.2
right so yeah weather's turned around

94.079 --> 99.27999999999999
again back around

97.2 --> 101.2
oh and then my camera freezes it's one

99.28 --> 103.68
of those days it's the third time

101.2 --> 103.68
already

104.159 --> 106.479
right

108.72 --> 112.64
blue clear skies

110.88 --> 115.83999999999999
no trails

112.64 --> 115.84
that have seen any

116.079 --> 119.91999999999999
yeah yesterday it was pretty much rainy

118.479 --> 123.2
all day

119.92 --> 123.2
rainy and cloudy

123.439 --> 127.88
uh yeah it's not so cloudy anymore

128.399 --> 133.599
just took a bath wonder if he's going to

130.479 --> 133.59900000000002
go back yep

138.16 --> 145.44
they always go

140.84 --> 145.44
back one time is never enough

145.52 --> 147.92000000000002
see

146.48 --> 150.23899999999998
second time

147.92 --> 152.39999999999998
will we go one more time

150.239 --> 152.4
no

154.84 --> 161.04
really yep

157.36 --> 161.04000000000002
and there he goes a third time

165.51 --> 168.6
[Music]

169.28 --> 173.84
but i mean yeah for a bird that is a

171.28 --> 175.12
pretty luxurious bath it like it even

173.84 --> 176.879
has

175.12 --> 179.12
salt in it

176.879 --> 179.12
so

180.239 --> 184.68
oh is he going a fourth time

185.92 --> 189.92
yep

187.28 --> 191.519
he's really enjoying that bath he's

189.92 --> 194.67999999999998
probably going to keep going until it's

191.519 --> 194.68
all gone

198.4 --> 202.239
yeah

200.64 --> 204.879
anyway

202.239 --> 204.879
that was funny

206.799 --> 209.92000000000002
yeah it's

208.64 --> 211.67999999999998
clear

209.92 --> 215.83999999999997
a couple of clouds they seem to be

211.68 --> 215.84
rushing by and it is very windy

218.319 --> 223.11999999999998
right i went out like

220.56 --> 225.44
for groceries in my t-shirt with my

223.12 --> 227.44
long jacket all over that but that was

225.44 --> 229.04
even a bit cold

227.44 --> 231.84
so

229.04 --> 234.48
there is still a bit cool

231.84 --> 239.159
but overall very nice day very beautiful

234.48 --> 239.159
lots of sun the way i like it

244.799 --> 249.76000000000002
okay

246.159 --> 251.599
hello pjc net first in chat

249.76 --> 254.959
borders boy

251.599 --> 259.359
good to see you

254.959 --> 263.32
it is tuesday this 26th

259.359 --> 263.32
of april 2022.

264.56 --> 267.88
hey turret306

273.26 --> 276.449
[Music]

278.4 --> 282.19899999999996
so how are you all doing

283.04 --> 285.91900000000004
i feel good at

284.479 --> 289.44
plenty of rest

285.919 --> 291.75899999999996
went to bed decently early

289.44 --> 294.24
had a shower

291.759 --> 297.44
which i kind of did need after like

294.24 --> 299.28000000000003
going through healing phase

297.44 --> 302.0
for a while

299.28 --> 302.0
with my jaw

305.6 --> 311.84000000000003
all right yesterday's flat earth debate

309.199 --> 314.08000000000004
it's pretty good

311.84 --> 314.08
but

315.919 --> 319.59999999999997
overall wasn't super active in it i

317.919 --> 321.52
think

319.6 --> 323.84000000000003
the couple of moments in the after show

321.52 --> 326.639
where i was able to like jump in with

323.84 --> 328.4
like a quick statement

326.639 --> 331.52
but yeah

328.4 --> 333.44
i did have like a very long conversation

331.52 --> 335.59999999999997
afterward after the recording stopped

333.44 --> 335.6
with

335.759 --> 340.45
with

336.84 --> 341.67999999999995
brian chocolate

340.45 --> 344.639
[Music]

341.68 --> 346.639
talking like deep deep experiment [ __ ]

344.639 --> 348.479
we do that sometimes when i'm in the

346.639 --> 350.96000000000004
mood for it and i was in the mood for it

348.479 --> 352.96
for some reason

350.96 --> 355.68
talking about figuring out the knowing

352.96 --> 357.52
which path experiment

355.68 --> 358.96
right

357.52 --> 361.52
basically

358.96 --> 363.52
i put my question marks behind it like

361.52 --> 365.039
yeah compared to a lot of other things

363.52 --> 366.4
that we've seen

365.039 --> 369.44
this one

366.4 --> 371.28
i've never actually seen that in person

369.44 --> 373.6
and every time

371.28 --> 375.039
somebody even says they witnessed it and

373.6 --> 377.03900000000004
like john

375.039 --> 379.199
refracted curvature

377.039 --> 381.68
that he did actually see it

379.199 --> 384.0
was in the room when it happened

381.68 --> 387.199
but even he had

384.0 --> 389.28
like not sufficient data to me

387.199 --> 391.36
and i really drilled it in on him at the

389.28 --> 394.35999999999996
time

391.36 --> 394.36
like

394.639 --> 399.28000000000003
like

396.08 --> 402.31899999999996
turn it off turn it on then the sensor

399.28 --> 402.31899999999996
to know the path

402.4 --> 408.96
right and it breaks the

405.039 --> 411.12
refraction or the diffraction pattern

408.96 --> 411.12
so

411.199 --> 417.28000000000003
what about in between

414.16 --> 420.0
and then the guys were like in between

417.28 --> 422.4
you can't no it's like no or you don't

420.0 --> 424.639
no there's nothing in between i was like

422.4 --> 426.0
yeah philosophically you're exactly

424.639 --> 428.40000000000003
correct

426.0 --> 430.0
but this is not about philosophy this is

428.4 --> 431.75899999999996
about an actual

430.0 --> 434.84
well substance

431.759 --> 437.44
in the physical world not an idea

434.84 --> 440.08
so what would happen

437.44 --> 442.639
if you took the sensor

440.08 --> 444.56
and you literally moved it

442.639 --> 446.40000000000003
towards the position where it would

444.56 --> 449.44
knowingly

446.4 --> 452.15999999999997
like according to tests

449.44 --> 453.52
figure out the path of the particle

452.16 --> 456.0
and then

453.52 --> 458.4
you yeah you take it away so it wouldn't

456.0 --> 461.52
with diffraction pattern and then you

458.4 --> 464.08
slowly move it like

461.52 --> 468.24
this the littlest amount of distance

464.08 --> 468.24
that is mechanically possible

469.12 --> 473.599
like what will happen

471.12 --> 476.84000000000003
will it be like a clear

473.599 --> 478.639
like a cut through reality type of sharp

476.84 --> 482.08
transition

478.639 --> 483.68
or will there be a spectrum

482.08 --> 486.0
between

483.68 --> 488.479
knowing the path and not knowing the

486.0 --> 490.96
path will something happen in between

488.479 --> 494.87899999999996
will there be a fuzzy transition thing

490.96 --> 496.71999999999997
right like nobody even ever asked that

494.879 --> 499.03900000000004
question apparently

496.72 --> 500.879
and i'm like hello

499.039 --> 501.919
we're talking about something physical

500.879 --> 503.91900000000004
here

501.919 --> 504.87899999999996
why don't you try to test the spectrum

503.919 --> 507.19899999999996
on this

504.879 --> 508.72
why isn't there a report about testing

507.199 --> 510.56
the spectrum on that

508.72 --> 512.32
about figuring out where's the

510.56 --> 513.919
transition between knowing and not

512.32 --> 516.479
knowing

513.919 --> 518.64
perfectly

516.479 --> 523.36
like what happens in between it's just

518.64 --> 526.0
oh it's there oh it's not there oh wow

523.36 --> 529.6
you got a one and a zero readout now

526.0 --> 529.6
what about everything in between

530.08 --> 534.72
but yeah i guess that a lot of people

531.839 --> 537.6
just have complications overcoming their

534.72 --> 539.519
philosophical bias about no you have

537.6 --> 542.48
knowing and not knowing you can't have

539.519 --> 544.72
anything in between oh really well

542.48 --> 546.64
here's where i'd like to contest that

544.72 --> 549.0400000000001
and i might be completely wrong right

546.64 --> 551.1999999999999
but if i'm gonna be wrong and there is a

549.04 --> 552.56
clear cut border between knowing and not

551.2 --> 556.48
knowing

552.56 --> 558.959
then at least i can like record that

556.48 --> 563.399
record how clear-cut

558.959 --> 563.399
that transition really is

563.519 --> 566.48
right so these are the types of things

565.44 --> 568.5600000000001
that i

566.48 --> 569.279
sometimes talk about with the guys after

568.56 --> 571.3599999999999
the

569.279 --> 573.68
recording stops with the flat earth

571.36 --> 575.6800000000001
debate after shows

573.68 --> 577.4399999999999
i don't know if any of you actually

575.68 --> 579.4399999999999
understood what i've just been trying to

577.44 --> 582.32
communicate

579.44 --> 585.519
if you don't don't feel shy to basically

582.32 --> 585.519
ask me to elaborate

585.68 --> 589.76
it is

586.8 --> 592.64
really really complicated i'm literally

589.76 --> 596.88
dabbling in analyzing like the the

592.64 --> 596.88
substances of reality

597.36 --> 602.279
right beyond philosophy anyway

606.56 --> 610.8
lost history flared oh there's a new one

608.64 --> 615.48
okay seeking star wars i haven't picked

610.8 --> 615.4799999999999
up on that yet i'll take a look

620.24 --> 623.36
norb worlds what

624.0 --> 626.56
go deep

626.72 --> 630.64
right i'm just

628.56 --> 633.4399999999999
i want some feedback on you guys on what

630.64 --> 634.959
i've just been trying to say like

633.44 --> 637.44
you understand

634.959 --> 639.8389999999999
trying to figure out

637.44 --> 642.9590000000001
physically

639.839 --> 645.6800000000001
if there is a transition between knowing

642.959 --> 648.88
and not knowing

645.68 --> 650.7199999999999
and the wave function collapse would be

648.88 --> 652.959
the indicator of that

650.72 --> 656.1600000000001
but maybe there's like anomalies in

652.959 --> 658.16
between has anybody ever even

656.16 --> 661.16
thought about that that that might be

658.16 --> 661.16
possible

662.48 --> 667.44
i did did feynman think about that ever

665.76 --> 670.16
i mean he was

667.44 --> 672.0790000000001
freaking like screwing around

670.16 --> 674.959
with these experiments all the time that

672.079 --> 676.64
he invented it pretty much or in yeah

674.959 --> 677.5999999999999
with other people

676.64 --> 681.1999999999999
so

677.6 --> 683.2
did any of them ever think about that

681.2 --> 686.2
i'm surprised why didn't you think about

683.2 --> 686.2
that

689.76 --> 694.16
[Music]

691.04 --> 697.68
right so that's me digging up gems in

694.16 --> 697.68
very unexpected places

697.92 --> 704.64
potential to be figured out

702.16 --> 708.3199999999999
and every time that happens yeah i could

704.64 --> 710.56
absolutely turn out to be wrong

708.32 --> 713.2
there's only one way to know whether

710.56 --> 716.68
you're wrong however and that is tested

713.2 --> 716.6800000000001
to no end

725.12 --> 732.24
there is likely a transition well pjcnet

729.839 --> 734.1600000000001
very easy for me to imagine that there

732.24 --> 735.92
would be a transition

734.16 --> 738.56
between

735.92 --> 740.88
not knowing and knowing

738.56 --> 744.4799999999999
but i don't know

740.88 --> 747.2
it might just be like insanely

744.48 --> 749.6800000000001
like imagine like the sensor is

747.2 --> 753.2
moving one micron

749.68 --> 755.92
every step like mic is so insanely my

753.2 --> 757.9200000000001
note like insanely my note that

755.92 --> 760.639
you'd barely have the instrumentation to

757.92 --> 763.12
pick it up the difference right

760.639 --> 764.0790000000001
and then just

763.12 --> 767.519
did

764.079 --> 769.519
will the wave function just like

767.519 --> 772.24
certainly collapse it might be

769.519 --> 775.68
instantaneous it might be like literally

772.24 --> 775.6800000000001
on the micron where

775.76 --> 781.4399999999999
not knowing switches into knowing

778.88 --> 783.04
right that might definitely be the

781.44 --> 784.72
result but

783.04 --> 786.639
it could also be

784.72 --> 789.0400000000001
that there's gonna be like this weird

786.639 --> 792.0
fuzzy thing in between where there's

789.04 --> 793.5999999999999
like a flux of knowing and not knowing

792.0 --> 795.6
what would happen

793.6 --> 800.44
right there's only one way to figure

795.6 --> 800.44
that out that's to test it

802.39 --> 805.4399999999999
[Music]

804.0 --> 807.6
right

805.44 --> 810.74
so i'm glad to remember that in order to

807.6 --> 814.249
talk about that right now

810.74 --> 814.249
[Music]

818.8 --> 821.68
yeah

820.24 --> 823.279
when you learn something new you feel

821.68 --> 825.5999999999999
like you're remembering right well

823.279 --> 826.72
that's probably because

825.6 --> 830.72
thinkers

826.72 --> 833.1990000000001
think of a lot of things in their youth

830.72 --> 836.32
that are visionary they just are unable

833.199 --> 838.079
to even see that about it

836.32 --> 840.1600000000001
because

838.079 --> 842.56
active thinkers tend especially when

840.16 --> 844.4699999999999
they're young and they start young

842.56 --> 846.3199999999999
follow natural patterns

844.47 --> 847.6800000000001
[Music]

846.32 --> 850.8000000000001
so

847.68 --> 852.8
like yeah things can be invented out of

850.8 --> 855.519
nothing

852.8 --> 858.399
and reinvented out of nothing without

855.519 --> 862.639
the reinventor ever having known about

858.399 --> 862.639
any other person having invented that

864.8 --> 871.3599999999999
right and that ties in to the paranormal

868.8 --> 873.68
as i kind of stamped it phenomenon of

871.36 --> 876.8000000000001
the hundred monkey effect which i

873.68 --> 879.76
brought up during the after show

876.8 --> 882.0
and nathan was all like oh it's so it's

879.76 --> 883.199
all disproven and blah blah blah and i'm

882.0 --> 885.68
like uh

883.199 --> 888.24
well

885.68 --> 890.56
i don't think so like i don't care

888.24 --> 893.36
whether like the agency or the

890.56 --> 896.079
university where that idea came from

893.36 --> 898.399
themselves debunked it supposedly i

896.079 --> 902.2399999999999
think it's pretty damn real

898.399 --> 902.24
it's just incredibly elusive

902.959 --> 907.76
right

904.48 --> 911.44
and it's almost like a very rough

907.76 --> 914.24
description of an effect that just

911.44 --> 918.0790000000001
that has to do with the spirit

914.24 --> 918.0790000000001
and the pool that we all share

922.88 --> 925.92
right

923.76 --> 927.8389999999999
but it's it's almost logical when you

925.92 --> 930.24
think that the patterns that we come up

927.839 --> 932.399
with things we figure out even when we

930.24 --> 933.92
can't connect it all

932.399 --> 936.48
naturally

933.92 --> 938.4799999999999
burrow their way through

936.48 --> 940.32
and and stumble upon

938.48 --> 943.519
things

940.32 --> 945.839
that can be done with it

943.519 --> 948.5600000000001
and at first you might not even see that

945.839 --> 951.6800000000001
and then later you'll think of it again

948.56 --> 954.4799999999999
you'll feel back to the past when you

951.68 --> 957.5999999999999
thought of it but now you got something

954.48 --> 959.9200000000001
as extra now you can connect it

957.6 --> 962.32
but you it's very likely when you have

959.92 --> 966.24
these constructive ideas you have almost

962.32 --> 966.24
like flashbacks to the past

966.839 --> 971.44
because those types of constructive

969.44 --> 972.9590000000001
ideas i think

971.44 --> 975.1990000000001
tend to like

972.959 --> 978.2399999999999
arrive early in your life they like

975.199 --> 981.04
pre-announce themselves

978.24 --> 983.839
before they actually manifest within

981.04 --> 983.8389999999999
your ideas

986.0 --> 989.12
right

987.36 --> 992.24
so that's more like

989.12 --> 994.839
about the very nature of ideas

992.24 --> 997.92
in in the akashic library at that in

994.839 --> 999.9200000000001
itself right and that makes suddenly

997.92 --> 1002.399
that the effect of the hundredth monkey

999.92 --> 1003.519
a loss a lot less

1002.399 --> 1006.079
fuzzy

1003.519 --> 1009.279
and more about just like

1006.079 --> 1012.8
the nature of the preponderance of

1009.279 --> 1016.32
information outside of the consciousness

1012.8 --> 1017.12
interacting with the consciousness

1016.32 --> 1019.6800000000001
right

1017.12 --> 1021.519
so in that sense it's almost like

1019.68 --> 1023.199
conjuring a

1021.519 --> 1025.52
an ether

1023.199 --> 1027.9189999999999
except not in physics

1025.52 --> 1030.24
right it it's purely about the spirit

1027.919 --> 1034.0
about consciousness about information

1030.24 --> 1034.0
which falls under supernatural

1034.079 --> 1038.1599999999999
right

1035.679 --> 1042.799
and there is something tangibly like

1038.16 --> 1042.799
it's so there we deal with it a lot

1044.72 --> 1049.6000000000001
we deal more with it than we even

1046.48 --> 1051.2
consciously tend to realize so very

1049.6 --> 1054.7199999999998
certain about that

1051.2 --> 1058.0
however light ether right

1054.72 --> 1060.0
that's not something that's real

1058.0 --> 1061.52
very certain about it because it is

1060.0 --> 1064.559
based on the misunderstanding of the

1061.52 --> 1068.48
nature of light in itself

1064.559 --> 1068.48
that's very clear-cut

1069.919 --> 1074.4
right that's the ironic part everybody's

1071.919 --> 1078.64
heard about ether ether it's in the

1074.4 --> 1078.64
ether it's the electric ether it's a

1079.28 --> 1084.48
whatever light ether

1082.08 --> 1086.6399999999999
but yeah who's heard about like the

1084.48 --> 1088.96
spirit weave

1086.64 --> 1091.3600000000001
or the akashic library some people might

1088.96 --> 1092.96
have heard about the akashic library

1091.36 --> 1095.52
but it's already

1092.96 --> 1098.32
kind of away from the pool of

1095.52 --> 1101.2
information and rather about the natural

1098.32 --> 1103.6789999999999
design that god made there of the

1101.2 --> 1105.1200000000001
information for us to stumble upon as we

1103.679 --> 1108.44
drift around

1105.12 --> 1108.4399999999998
in the pool

1111.28 --> 1115.12
anyway

1113.2 --> 1117.44
losing track of my own train of thinking

1115.12 --> 1117.4399999999998
here

1118.32 --> 1122.4399999999998
what are you guys talking about

1127.28 --> 1132.6399999999999
hebrew letter for water is men okay

1130.96 --> 1134.08
what of caution memory remember

1132.64 --> 1135.1200000000001
interesting

1134.08 --> 1137.52
right

1135.12 --> 1139.76
well that certainly does like

1137.52 --> 1143.52
hook into the concept

1139.76 --> 1145.28
or the other paranormal type of science

1143.52 --> 1150.24
i'm calling it paranormal like i'm

1145.28 --> 1151.12
categorizing the word paranormal now

1150.24 --> 1153.52
it's

1151.12 --> 1155.12
it just kind of happened yesterday but

1153.52 --> 1157.6
it made sense

1155.12 --> 1158.9599999999998
from completely out there disconnected

1157.6 --> 1161.76
from everything

1158.96 --> 1162.88
i can make it into a category

1161.76 --> 1165.76
right

1162.88 --> 1167.44
so supernatural

1165.76 --> 1168.799
within physics

1167.44 --> 1172.64
is

1168.799 --> 1175.36
like non-tangible but provable

1172.64 --> 1175.3600000000001
information

1175.84 --> 1181.6789999999999
right very weird but it is a thing it's

1178.72 --> 1184.4
technically a substance because it is

1181.679 --> 1185.679
variable and manipulatable in what it

1184.4 --> 1188.96
does

1185.679 --> 1190.799
it's very amazing the knowing which path

1188.96 --> 1193.28
experiment

1190.799 --> 1194.96
like proves that that it is basically a

1193.28 --> 1196.72
substance and that's how we came up with

1194.96 --> 1198.88
the idea oh what about the spectrum

1196.72 --> 1199.679
between knowing and and not knowing

1198.88 --> 1202.7990000000002
right

1199.679 --> 1204.88
because it is a substance it's beyond a

1202.799 --> 1206.72
philosophical construct in our minds

1204.88 --> 1209.679
it's a substance that's what's so

1206.72 --> 1209.679
amazing about it

1211.84 --> 1215.84
now lost my train of thought again

1214.03 --> 1219.6789999999999
[Music]

1215.84 --> 1220.8799999999999
oh yeah kasich library waters memory

1219.679 --> 1223.3600000000001
yeah

1220.88 --> 1226.72
paranormal

1223.36 --> 1228.3999999999999
paranormal versus supernatural right

1226.72 --> 1229.76
so paranormal

1228.4 --> 1231.919
would be

1229.76 --> 1231.919
like

1232.64 --> 1238.0
a pure spirit conscious or more mostly

1235.76 --> 1240.799
spirit not even conscious

1238.0 --> 1240.799
mind-based

1240.88 --> 1246.24
phenomenon natural phenomena naturally

1243.84 --> 1248.32
occurring phenomenon

1246.24 --> 1249.76
that literally does something that is

1248.32 --> 1251.12
observable

1249.76 --> 1252.0
in some way

1251.12 --> 1253.84
right

1252.0 --> 1256.08
and yeah there's all kind oh there's

1253.84 --> 1258.48
goofy [ __ ] oh look at the scratchy

1256.08 --> 1259.76
noises on the on the video recording or

1258.48 --> 1260.88
something right or

1259.76 --> 1262.72
yeah yeah

1260.88 --> 1265.44
but technically

1262.72 --> 1268.96
it is paranormal

1265.44 --> 1271.6000000000001
because it is something a phenomenon

1268.96 --> 1273.8400000000001
allegedly really happening

1271.6 --> 1277.84
attempting to be recorded attempted to

1273.84 --> 1277.84
be relayed like that it's there

1278.159 --> 1281.679
and it is

1279.36 --> 1283.799
often an influence of the mind or the

1281.679 --> 1285.3600000000001
spirit right ghosts

1283.799 --> 1288.32
telekinesis

1285.36 --> 1292.1589999999999
but also dr emoto's work

1288.32 --> 1293.2
the ice crystallization of water

1292.159 --> 1294.64
and then

1293.2 --> 1297.2
basically

1294.64 --> 1299.2
subjecting it to information

1297.2 --> 1301.679
either through a word

1299.2 --> 1303.28
written on a label on the water before

1301.679 --> 1306.64
it's frozen or

1303.28 --> 1308.96
simply meditation and focus or music

1306.64 --> 1310.159
and then the ice crystal starts to

1308.96 --> 1312.48
display

1310.159 --> 1315.679
very specific patterns

1312.48 --> 1316.88
that are like systemic

1315.679 --> 1320.4
and like

1316.88 --> 1323.5200000000002
they read out this sim similar patterns

1320.4 --> 1326.5590000000002
depending on the word meaning or the

1323.52 --> 1330.48
frequency the feeling that's really

1326.559 --> 1330.48
astounding and it is paranormal

1331.28 --> 1337.2
because it is pure

1333.12 --> 1339.28
elusive internal world influence

1337.2 --> 1342.559
feelings and ideas

1339.28 --> 1345.2
that are literally manifesting

1342.559 --> 1349.12
systemic patterns in the physical world

1345.2 --> 1349.1200000000001
now that's also paranormal

1349.76 --> 1353.679
right there's something happening in the

1351.6 --> 1356.9599999999998
physical world because

1353.679 --> 1360.2800000000002
of an influence directly of the spirit

1356.96 --> 1360.28
and the mind

1360.559 --> 1366.0
and with paranormal you could like it's

1363.039 --> 1368.64
very close to categorizing it right next

1366.0 --> 1370.48
to physics right there is a naturally

1368.64 --> 1372.48
occurring phenomenon

1370.48 --> 1375.48
allegedly that's the whole

1372.48 --> 1375.48
issue

1378.96 --> 1382.64
but yeah

1381.44 --> 1385.28
it's just

1382.64 --> 1388.7990000000002
it's amazing how that all comes together

1385.28 --> 1391.84
anyway hey thank you jedo for

1388.799 --> 1395.48
joining as a ranger

1391.84 --> 1395.48
i appreciate that

1412.96 --> 1418.4
what jeff guy said there was computer

1416.0 --> 1420.559
memory experiments with water in long

1418.4 --> 1423.44
tubes what

1420.559 --> 1423.44
never heard of that

1427.76 --> 1431.279
dr emoto yeah yeah

1429.76 --> 1433.919
the japanese

1431.279 --> 1436.48
doctor with the yeah that's what i was

1433.919 --> 1436.48
talking about

1436.64 --> 1441.72
and it is kind of funny that he's called

1438.4 --> 1441.72
dr emoto

1453.84 --> 1456.84
right

1461.76 --> 1467.12
but it's just for me

1464.64 --> 1469.279
look when i was much younger

1467.12 --> 1473.039
in my mind i was like

1469.279 --> 1475.279
i i didn't understand why like physical

1473.039 --> 1476.8799999999999
material science

1475.279 --> 1478.96
and like the spiritual and the

1476.88 --> 1481.279
paranormal one ghost and all that why

1478.96 --> 1482.96
that was separate why it was always so

1481.279 --> 1485.52
rigidly separate

1482.96 --> 1487.8400000000001
so it's like in my teens even

1485.52 --> 1490.559
i really gave myself like a long term

1487.84 --> 1494.3999999999999
missions build a bridge

1490.559 --> 1496.559
in between like an actual

1494.4 --> 1500.64
permanent bridge

1496.559 --> 1502.799
that literally bridges the gaps so that

1500.64 --> 1506.3200000000002
it can be unified

1502.799 --> 1508.48
a complete understanding

1506.32 --> 1510.72
and yeah this

1508.48 --> 1513.039
seems to feel like it is building

1510.72 --> 1515.919
towards that

1513.039 --> 1520.799
like i'm starting to get into places

1515.919 --> 1524.3200000000002
where i can connect up like psychology

1520.799 --> 1526.48
and spirit mechanics

1524.32 --> 1529.36
and healing and all that and energy

1526.48 --> 1531.919
things with like physical sciences

1529.36 --> 1534.1589999999999
because it's right there

1531.919 --> 1536.48
it is absolutely real and i don't give a

1534.159 --> 1539.44
[ __ ] if anybody believes it or not i

1536.48 --> 1539.44
know it's real

1539.679 --> 1546.48
from a lot of practical experience

1543.76 --> 1548.72
like it's literally second nature

1546.48 --> 1551.44
like the healing part i it's literally

1548.72 --> 1553.76
second nature yeah

1551.44 --> 1556.96
as somebody would

1553.76 --> 1559.76
take a hammer and nail a nail into wood

1556.96 --> 1561.679
and do it as second nature as that level

1559.76 --> 1564.0
i heal

1561.679 --> 1566.72
it's so automated i don't even have

1564.0 --> 1570.0
cognitive thinking about it anymore it i

1566.72 --> 1571.44
just do it it's that real

1570.0 --> 1572.48
yeah

1571.44 --> 1575.919
so

1572.48 --> 1579.6
if it can be that automated

1575.919 --> 1580.48
then it's almost like engineering

1579.6 --> 1582.6399999999999
and

1580.48 --> 1585.039
well all engineering

1582.64 --> 1587.279
effectively could be said to

1585.039 --> 1591.84
have ties with science

1587.279 --> 1595.2
so why could well the paranormal not

1591.84 --> 1600.6399999999999
it's just a very tricky connection

1595.2 --> 1600.64
but it is doable the bridge is doable

1601.279 --> 1607.2
anyway

1603.52 --> 1607.2
seem to be very inspired today

1611.44 --> 1616.559
they've removed the ether

1614.88 --> 1620.919
i don't understand what you mean seeking

1616.559 --> 1620.9189999999999
star water removed it in what

1638.08 --> 1642.559
like who removed the ether and again

1640.64 --> 1643.76
like are you talking about the spirit

1642.559 --> 1645.9189999999999
pool

1643.76 --> 1647.6
the spirit ether

1645.919 --> 1650.24
light ether

1647.6 --> 1651.52
the electric ether there's all kinds of

1650.24 --> 1654.159
these

1651.52 --> 1655.52
yeah elusive fields that are definitely

1654.159 --> 1657.3600000000001
there

1655.52 --> 1659.36
so

1657.36 --> 1661.36
it's kind of weird to say when they

1659.36 --> 1663.1999999999998
remove the ether that could mean like

1661.36 --> 1666.1999999999998
three different completely different

1663.2 --> 1666.2
things

1681.57 --> 1684.7
[Music]

1688.799 --> 1697.279
yeah pj c net you so overestimate what

1693.36 --> 1699.84
the so-called elite know about yeah you

1697.279 --> 1702.799
know what they're really good at

1699.84 --> 1704.9599999999998
making everybody believe that they're in

1702.799 --> 1707.039
full control

1704.96 --> 1709.2
that's what they're really

1707.039 --> 1710.799
really good at

1709.2 --> 1714.32
yeah

1710.799 --> 1715.6
they don't know everything

1714.32 --> 1717.84
i believe

1715.6 --> 1720.1589999999999
from some personal experience that i'm

1717.84 --> 1723.279
not going to be specific about

1720.159 --> 1725.919
i'm very certain by now that like most

1723.279 --> 1729.2
of what they do is just a bluff to stay

1725.919 --> 1731.279
in control and they're really good at it

1729.2 --> 1733.44
they know how to bluff about things that

1731.279 --> 1737.48
you don't even understand about

1733.44 --> 1737.48
yeah that's the trick

1741.6 --> 1746.7199999999998
yeah that's how they get you there's no

1744.48 --> 1751.24
there's barely any defense for this the

1746.72 --> 1751.24
only defense is actually knowing

1754.24 --> 1759.36
they're just painting with it they don't

1756.799 --> 1761.039
understand exactly what all these things

1759.36 --> 1763.039
are they're not the builders of the

1761.039 --> 1768.1589999999999
information

1763.039 --> 1768.1589999999999
they just know how to bluff with it

1769.6 --> 1774.32
that's what they do

1771.36 --> 1779.1589999999999
they paint with things they don't even

1774.32 --> 1779.1589999999999
understand and they're very good at it

1783.6 --> 1788.799
so don't overestimate

1786.0 --> 1790.32
elite they're just really good at

1788.799 --> 1793.52
keeping control

1790.32 --> 1796.08
that's all they are not filled with

1793.52 --> 1798.48
critical information and if they have

1796.08 --> 1802.32
that critical information they probably

1798.48 --> 1805.52
don't even realize how important it is

1802.32 --> 1807.6789999999999
it barely would touch them

1805.52 --> 1809.84
like they could not allow themselves to

1807.679 --> 1810.88
get obsessed over it because guess what

1809.84 --> 1812.48
happens

1810.88 --> 1814.5590000000002
oh you're gonna

1812.48 --> 1815.52
dig higher into understanding yeah yeah

1814.559 --> 1818.08
guess what you're gonna have to

1815.52 --> 1820.08
relinquish control

1818.08 --> 1823.399
yeah so they wouldn't even do that even

1820.08 --> 1823.399
if they could

1825.6 --> 1830.1589999999999
i've met these people

1827.919 --> 1830.159
okay

1830.48 --> 1837.3990000000001
some of them in the real world and a lot

1833.279 --> 1837.399
of them in the dark world

1844.399 --> 1850.4399999999998
there is only one ether they call it

1847.44 --> 1850.44
what

1854.64 --> 1859.3990000000001
what does that even mean seeking star

1856.399 --> 1859.399
wars

1867.76 --> 1871.919
i don't know anybody that calls ether

1869.919 --> 1873.76
gravity so i don't know what you're

1871.919 --> 1877.48
talking about

1873.76 --> 1877.48
seeking snow water

1878.98 --> 1882.119
[Music]

1900.399 --> 1905.559
yeah pj seen it i i have no doubt

1913.519 --> 1917.1200000000001
i bet there's a whole bunch of people

1915.12 --> 1919.76
with great knowledge

1917.12 --> 1922.08
that are not sucking devil's dick in

1919.76 --> 1924.399
some way that aren't just there to more

1922.08 --> 1927.6
power to build a call to bend people to

1924.399 --> 1929.1999999999998
their control to sacrifice them

1927.6 --> 1931.1999999999998
to the devil

1929.2 --> 1935.279
because everybody listens to those

1931.2 --> 1938.0
[ __ ] always right no but the real

1935.279 --> 1939.6
shamans out there and there are plenty i

1938.0 --> 1941.039
bet

1939.6 --> 1943.6789999999999
they're probably going to be in

1941.039 --> 1946.559
situations kind of similar to mine

1943.679 --> 1950.0
just relatively isolated people that

1946.559 --> 1953.279
have like incredible insight and wisdom

1950.0 --> 1955.76
very constructive that are just

1953.279 --> 1957.36
proto-spiritual

1955.76 --> 1959.6
and they

1957.36 --> 1962.1589999999999
they will never have been heard about

1959.6 --> 1964.8799999999999
ever

1962.159 --> 1967.919
it's what happens

1964.88 --> 1967.919
if it's too real

1968.0 --> 1973.519
and not bound to the devil with money

1971.12 --> 1976.2399999999998
interest and and death

1973.519 --> 1979.1200000000001
then it won't be known about it won't

1976.24 --> 1981.679
spread like wildfire the devil spreads

1979.12 --> 1984.9599999999998
like wildfire

1981.679 --> 1986.24
yeah a real shaman you have to really

1984.96 --> 1987.2
really

1986.24 --> 1989.039
dig

1987.2 --> 1991.2
to find that

1989.039 --> 1995.0
and

1991.2 --> 1995.0
it's just how it works

2014.0 --> 2019.679
you're behind live again

2015.76 --> 2022.32
i just make sure to sl the red bar stays

2019.679 --> 2022.3200000000002
to the right

2023.76 --> 2026.24
right back

2028.64 --> 2035.21
the elite have reset this civilization

2032.03 --> 2035.21
[Music]

2036.159 --> 2039.44
yeah

2037.279 --> 2041.6
that most of the time the people wanted

2039.44 --> 2041.6000000000001
it

2041.76 --> 2044.559
or needed it

2045.44 --> 2051.359
people that are not in control

2048.48 --> 2054.839
tend to basically expect

2051.359 --> 2054.839
that to happen

2064.079 --> 2070.8
yeah you know what is a a reset too

2068.48 --> 2074.32
what is a reset

2070.8 --> 2075.8390000000004
it's when basically people halt

2074.32 --> 2080.56
civilization

2075.839 --> 2082.56
because there is so much junk piled up

2080.56 --> 2084.72
certain people are so corrupted so

2082.56 --> 2086.72
degenerated that they just have to be

2084.72 --> 2089.4399999999996
taken care of

2086.72 --> 2091.919
like yes i'm sorry we all want to be

2089.44 --> 2094.2400000000002
civilized but these people have to die

2091.919 --> 2095.839
now

2094.24 --> 2098.64
literally

2095.839 --> 2101.599
yeah that's also a reset it happens it

2098.64 --> 2103.68
just happens at some point

2101.599 --> 2105.599
everybody

2103.68 --> 2106.64
will be like

2105.599 --> 2109.76
yeah

2106.64 --> 2111.5989999999997
these people just have to die

2109.76 --> 2113.44
it's over

2111.599 --> 2116.6400000000003
no more

2113.44 --> 2119.04
it's no more earthly systems or rules

2116.64 --> 2123.2799999999997
that are gonna stop that from happening

2119.04 --> 2123.2799999999997
now yeah that's also a reset

2128.079 --> 2131.8390000000004
and yeah of course a lot of the times

2130.56 --> 2133.04
elites

2131.839 --> 2135.92
whatever

2133.04 --> 2138.96
try to anticipate for that

2135.92 --> 2142.2400000000002
they shove their mark tears

2138.96 --> 2144.88
the really [ __ ] up ones in front to be

2142.24 --> 2149.2799999999997
slaughtered by such moments automated

2144.88 --> 2151.839
resets in the hopes that they will be

2149.28 --> 2155.76
spared by it that they will be seen as

2151.839 --> 2160.24
reasonable enough to survive right

2155.76 --> 2160.2400000000002
like french revolution situation

2167.359 --> 2169.68
right

2170.64 --> 2174.8799999999997
but yeah that's still relatively

2172.32 --> 2174.88
controlled

2181.76 --> 2188.88
we need at least no it just you don't

2185.04 --> 2190.96
need it's just going to happen

2188.88 --> 2192.7200000000003
if you're going to say we need this and

2190.96 --> 2194.88
then you're oh then you're telling

2192.72 --> 2196.16
everybody in the world oh you need to do

2194.88 --> 2198.4
this now

2196.16 --> 2198.3999999999996
no

2198.56 --> 2206.24
you do it or you just hold on

2202.32 --> 2206.2400000000002
and wait until it just happens

2211.119 --> 2218.599
we don't need people to tell everybody

2214.079 --> 2218.599
in the world what we need next

2244.96 --> 2249.599
it never not be self-sufficient uh

2250.0 --> 2254.72
yeah that can't really work

2252.96 --> 2257.7200000000003
with this many people that's just

2254.72 --> 2257.72
impossible

2262.0 --> 2265.04
right

2262.96 --> 2266.8
what we need however

2265.04 --> 2268.839
is to purge

2266.8 --> 2272.0
these demonic

2268.839 --> 2273.119
freaks that have are hellbound to

2272.0 --> 2276.0
basically

2273.119 --> 2277.76
destroy every logical foundation of

2276.0 --> 2283.079
human nature

2277.76 --> 2283.079
yeah they need to be exterminated

2285.04 --> 2290.4
and in my personal view

2287.839 --> 2292.64
very brutally

2290.4 --> 2294.2400000000002
very brutally not just

2292.64 --> 2296.96
oh jail

2294.24 --> 2300.56
standard execution no brutally

2296.96 --> 2303.04
they need to be made an example for

2300.56 --> 2305.2799999999997
for everybody to fear

2303.04 --> 2308.88
like this is what happens when you truly

2305.28 --> 2313.7200000000003
go demonic this is going to be your fate

2308.88 --> 2313.7200000000003
if you let yourself slide there

2327.88 --> 2331.149
[Music]

2332.0 --> 2336.64
okay tara 306 i knew that would

2336.8 --> 2342.2400000000002
evil your indian inner

2339.76 --> 2342.2400000000002
nature

2342.64 --> 2345.52
yeah

2344.16 --> 2346.96
no

2345.52 --> 2349.44
whatever is going to happen i don't want

2346.96 --> 2352.2400000000002
to describe that

2349.44 --> 2355.28
i might say things in chat sometimes

2352.24 --> 2357.5989999999997
especially to really nasty ass trolls

2355.28 --> 2359.92
i'll tell that like because

2357.599 --> 2362.7200000000003
but i don't like to do that

2359.92 --> 2364.079
to go into descriptions is like torture

2362.72 --> 2368.359
[ __ ]

2364.079 --> 2368.3590000000004
when i'm on camera thanks

2372.24 --> 2379.9199999999996
but yeah basically

2375.52 --> 2379.92
they need to be made a harsh example of

2381.119 --> 2388.7200000000003
so that everybody can read their terror

2384.64 --> 2389.92
and fear and regret and anguish as they

2388.72 --> 2392.48
perish

2389.92 --> 2394.96
that that the looks on their faces can

2392.48 --> 2397.359
be very clearly

2394.96 --> 2397.359
scene

2399.359 --> 2404.319
must be visible

2401.28 --> 2406.2400000000002
to everybody like that's what will

2404.319 --> 2408.72
happen to you

2406.24 --> 2411.1189999999997
if you allow yourself to slide there

2408.72 --> 2414.319
that's your fate yeah

2411.119 --> 2414.319
nothing less than that

2418.96 --> 2424.8
i seen this guy at your angel spoons

2422.24 --> 2427.04
theory

2424.8 --> 2429.119
yeah what's wrong with the angel spoons

2427.04 --> 2432.079
theory

2429.119 --> 2433.599
i think it's a great theory

2432.079 --> 2435.599
colloquial theory that is there's

2433.599 --> 2436.96
nothing really to very manipulate just

2435.599 --> 2438.7200000000003
yet

2436.96 --> 2441.76
but yeah i think that there is a

2438.72 --> 2444.16
magnetic effect

2441.76 --> 2447.76
in several places

2444.16 --> 2449.839
it like on the earth that causes like a

2447.76 --> 2451.92
stirring effect

2449.839 --> 2453.68
literally it's being stirred like an

2451.92 --> 2458.28
angel spoon that's why i call it an

2453.68 --> 2458.2799999999997
angel spoon right it's not ridiculous

[Music]

2480.4 --> 2485.2000000000003
what are you talking about rick back

2483.2 --> 2487.1189999999997
bonnie won't protect you once no one

2485.2 --> 2489.4399999999996
owns anything yeah but it's not gonna

2487.119 --> 2489.44
happen

2490.56 --> 2494.7999999999997
like that's not gonna happen if that's

2492.72 --> 2497.839
literally what they do

2494.8 --> 2500.8
then there will be civil war until

2497.839 --> 2501.7599999999998
either all humans all three humans are

2500.8 --> 2502.7200000000003
dead

2501.76 --> 2506.48
or

2502.72 --> 2509.9199999999996
the [ __ ] up satanic elite are all dead

2506.48 --> 2511.44
they can't actually do that you see

2509.92 --> 2514.7200000000003
like they might

2511.44 --> 2518.079
give the impression like a a nightmare

2514.72 --> 2519.359
dystopian story about how that's really

2518.079 --> 2522.4
happening

2519.359 --> 2523.5989999999997
they can't actually do that without

2522.4 --> 2527.76
triggering

2523.599 --> 2527.76
worldwide civil war

2532.64 --> 2537.44
it's not gonna work

2534.88 --> 2539.28
i mean china can do that sort of [ __ ] at

2537.44 --> 2541.44
this point apparently

2539.28 --> 2543.92
apparently like the the civil the

2541.44 --> 2548.0
civilians they're literally allowed to

2543.92 --> 2549.52
be tortured in public and no one will do

2548.0 --> 2551.52
anything

2549.52 --> 2554.72
anything

2551.52 --> 2558.88
all just sit and sob and cry and try to

2554.72 --> 2560.48
forget about it like absolute slaves

2558.88 --> 2562.48
so

2560.48 --> 2564.64
but that's china

2562.48 --> 2567.119
that's not the rest of the world

2564.64 --> 2570.16
not even close

2567.119 --> 2572.56
other people wouldn't allow that

2570.16 --> 2575.2
i don't understand how the chinese are

2572.56 --> 2578.56
able to allow that to happen

2575.2 --> 2580.7999999999997
i don't understand that

2578.56 --> 2582.72
another fragment

2580.8 --> 2585.3590000000004
of chinese

2582.72 --> 2586.8799999999997
genetics in me like it was a 16th or

2585.359 --> 2589.359
something

2586.88 --> 2591.92
very remote

2589.359 --> 2593.359
i don't understand how they can endure

2591.92 --> 2596.4
that

2593.359 --> 2599.68
like why it's like oh

2596.4 --> 2602.1600000000003
military whatever coming to nail you

2599.68 --> 2604.72
down the doors yeah

2602.16 --> 2606.96
why don't you freaking like get your

2604.72 --> 2610.56
knives and literally stab them all to

2606.96 --> 2613.28
death get your guns then start

2610.56 --> 2615.2
going after other teams and killing them

that's what you would normally do

2642.72 --> 2649.839
they don't seem to have any balls left

2645.68 --> 2649.839
there to do that now

2668.96 --> 2674.96

2707.28 --> 2712.5600000000004
been going down in china for half a

2709.68 --> 2714.8799999999997
century pjcnet

2712.56 --> 2716.96
that sort of [ __ ] happened there 50

2714.88 --> 2719.28
years ago

2716.96 --> 2722.0
why do you talk about getting close no

2719.28 --> 2723.119
that's china that's what they do there

2722.0 --> 2724.72
yeah

2723.119 --> 2729.92
that's what they have been doing there

2724.72 --> 2730.839
it's horrific it's not getting closer

2729.92 --> 2735.2000000000003
it's

2730.839 --> 2738.72
not can't get closer

2735.2 --> 2741.359
yeah it's just gas lighting all of it is

2738.72 --> 2743.52
one giant gas lighting attempts like

2741.359 --> 2745.68
look at the nightmare oh we're coming

2743.52 --> 2748.0
for you this is all coming from no

2745.68 --> 2751.04
that's coming for them because they're

2748.0 --> 2753.04
[ __ ] china

2751.04 --> 2754.0
they don't seem to know what to do about

2753.04 --> 2757.44
it

2754.0 --> 2762.72
that's pretty like internal that's not

2757.44 --> 2765.359
coming to us people would kill them here

2762.72 --> 2767.359
or in america at least the netherlands i

2765.359 --> 2769.5989999999997
have no idea everybody's so freaking

2767.359 --> 2772.64
wursified

2769.599 --> 2772.6400000000003
just i don't know

2773.44 --> 2777.68
but there's still a couple of very

2775.599 --> 2780.8
revolutionary spirited people here in

2777.68 --> 2782.48
the netherlands like somewhere hidden

2780.8 --> 2786.5600000000004
probably

2782.48 --> 2786.56
like that's not going to happen here

2786.64 --> 2792.0789999999997
you understand stop

2789.04 --> 2792.079
being so

2801.599 --> 2804.0
they're intimidated about the

2802.56 --> 2806.56
restrictions and posts on the west that

2804.0 --> 2808.319
most people complied with yeah you know

2806.56 --> 2811.04
what that is

2808.319 --> 2811.04
[ __ ]

2811.359 --> 2817.2
because you don't have to comply

2814.0 --> 2820.56
yeah people did it voluntarily because

2817.2 --> 2820.56
they're [ __ ]

2825.359 --> 2830.7999999999997
effectively the people that have done

2827.52 --> 2834.88
that would be the people that would now

2830.8 --> 2836.88
80 years ago be in work camps isolated

2834.88 --> 2840.56
from everybody else

2836.88 --> 2840.56
awaiting a certain fate

2840.64 --> 2844.4
yeah

2841.76 --> 2847.5200000000004
except now there's no work camps there's

2844.4 --> 2852.359
just muzzles everywhere

2847.52 --> 2852.359
they put it on themselves

2853.44 --> 2859.599
they can't be forced to wear that i have

2857.44 --> 2861.76
not been forced to wear it

2859.599 --> 2864.1600000000003
throughout the entire two years and

2861.76 --> 2867.28
everybody was wearing that [ __ ]

2864.16 --> 2872.44
you don't have to wear it people do it

2867.28 --> 2872.44
to themselves because they're [ __ ]

[Music]

2901.04 --> 2903.359
right

2907.2 --> 2913.52
it's also could be considered

2909.68 --> 2916.0
it's a worship of government you see

2913.52 --> 2919.119
the people that do that that do wear the

2916.0 --> 2919.119
masks even now

2919.44 --> 2924.16
why do they do that

2921.52 --> 2926.64
because the government tells them

2924.16 --> 2929.2
well to us that's just like oh it's a

2926.64 --> 2932.16
speaking point it's a

2929.2 --> 2933.2
a manipulation tech well to some people

2932.16 --> 2935.5989999999997
it's

2933.2 --> 2940.16
literally

2935.599 --> 2943.2000000000003
literally the voice of god

2940.16 --> 2945.52
they were worship it

2943.2 --> 2948.72
and you're gonna like some of those

2945.52 --> 2950.64
people are so so tied to it you

2948.72 --> 2953.2
literally have to like

2950.64 --> 2955.52
physically violate them

2953.2 --> 2958.0
to get through to them to stop because

2955.52 --> 2961.839
they're obsessed they have nothing else

2958.0 --> 2963.68
it's just you do what they say until you

2961.839 --> 2967.2
die and if you

2963.68 --> 2969.2
die having obeyed every second then you

2967.2 --> 2971.359
go to

2969.2 --> 2973.7599999999998
government heaven or something i don't

2971.359 --> 2975.52
know what the [ __ ] if they even have a

2973.76 --> 2980.4
conception of that

2975.52 --> 2981.28
they worship it you understand they were

2980.4 --> 2984.88
ship

2981.28 --> 2987.76
it like a god and it's not an

2984.88 --> 2991.04
exaggeration that's not a metaphor

2987.76 --> 2992.559
that's literally what they do they just

2991.04 --> 2996.64
wear it

2992.559 --> 2999.0400000000004
they do what they're told until they die

2996.64 --> 3001.359
and you have to have get violent to get

2999.04 --> 3004.0
through to those people

3001.359 --> 3007.2
because they will not listen they

3004.0 --> 3009.52
worship government they worship it no

3007.2 --> 3010.839
matter what's sitting there

3009.52 --> 3014.559
they're like

3010.839 --> 3014.5589999999997
robots insane

3015.24 --> 3023.5099999999998
[Music]

3023.52 --> 3027.68
personal yeah but it's always been a

3025.599 --> 3029.6800000000003
personal choice but if somebody in

3027.68 --> 3033.04
government says

3029.68 --> 3037.7599999999998
you must do this then they do it

3033.04 --> 3037.7599999999998
because they worship them like gods

3038.24 --> 3043.5989999999997
you must do as they say it's not about

3041.28 --> 3048.079
what you're allowed to do you must do

3043.599 --> 3048.079
what they say even if you don't have to

3050.079 --> 3054.319
that's what they do that's what these

3052.16 --> 3058.3999999999996
insane

3054.319 --> 3061.2
people that just do everything

3058.4 --> 3063.2000000000003
the yeah the the beast tells them to

3061.2 --> 3065.4399999999996
it's effectively the beast they worship

3063.2 --> 3067.4399999999996
the beast it comes through government it

3065.44 --> 3071.68
comes through

3067.44 --> 3071.68
and specific narrative culture

3071.76 --> 3076.88
but it is the beast they worship it

3074.559 --> 3079.28
and they do everything it tells them to

3076.88 --> 3080.319
and they will not let go

3079.28 --> 3082.6400000000003
they're like

3080.319 --> 3084.079
death bound like they're staring into it

3082.64 --> 3088.48
and it's like yes

3084.079 --> 3088.48
i'm gonna hold on to this until i die

3091.28 --> 3095.3590000000004
and in a very creepy way it's kind of

3094.079 --> 3098.48
ecstatic

3095.359 --> 3101.44
to be in that state i know because i had

3098.48 --> 3103.599
a very strong tendency to do that

3101.44 --> 3105.68
when i was much younger

3103.599 --> 3108.48
it's ecstatic

3105.68 --> 3111.52
but it's literally being hypnotized by

3108.48 --> 3116.079
the devil yes it's ecstatic but you're

3111.52 --> 3116.079
gonna freaking die if you do it too long

3117.92 --> 3122.559
and if you get yourself dependent on

3120.319 --> 3125.599
that feeling then you get yourself

3122.559 --> 3129.3590000000004
locked in and then only violence can

3125.599 --> 3133.52
break you away from the gaze

3129.359 --> 3138.04
from that gaze connection with the beast

3133.52 --> 3138.04
it's how it works i was there

3146.72 --> 3152.48
it's how they originally tricked me

3150.4 --> 3155.6800000000003
into kindness kindness indirectly

3152.48 --> 3155.68
support eugenics

3156.72 --> 3161.839
like because of the beast

3158.96 --> 3163.599
and their propaganda even in the 90s i

3161.839 --> 3165.52
started to think like yeah there is an

3163.599 --> 3168.7200000000003
overpopulation issue that's like a

3165.52 --> 3171.68
really tough burden or you would i i was

3168.72 --> 3173.7599999999998
doing that because

3171.68 --> 3175.52
i believed it was really necessary

3173.76 --> 3178.5200000000004
because all these people were saying

3175.52 --> 3178.52
that

3180.4 --> 3183.76
locked in with the beast

3184.0 --> 3188.559
now

3185.68 --> 3190.72
i know it's all

3188.559 --> 3193.3590000000004
it's hellbound it's oversimplified it's

3190.72 --> 3195.68
actually not rational the real eugenesis

3193.359 --> 3197.5989999999997
that do these things

3195.68 --> 3199.2799999999997
it's not about

3197.599 --> 3201.76
trying to maintain

3199.28 --> 3203.76
a balance in the population no they just

3201.76 --> 3206.4
want everything for them they want to

3203.76 --> 3208.48
turn everything into a slave

3206.4 --> 3210.96
to dig up gold for them and work

3208.48 --> 3214.2400000000002
themselves to death that's all it is to

3210.96 --> 3216.8
these [ __ ] freaks

3214.24 --> 3219.68
they just want slaves that's their

3216.8 --> 3222.2400000000002
eugenics agenda they want everybody to

3219.68 --> 3224.5589999999997
be slaves to work themselves to death

3222.24 --> 3227.2799999999997
for us and that's it that's the only

3224.559 --> 3229.28
thing they care about they want us gone

3227.28 --> 3232.2400000000002
they don't want balance they don't want

3229.28 --> 3234.559
eugenics they just want everybody to

3232.24 --> 3237.839
give them everything and then die

3479.359 --> 3482.72
when it happens

3481.04 --> 3487.319
you know it's ending soon that's what i

3482.72 --> 3487.319
thought 10 years ago too

3491.599 --> 3496.4
as we know it what do we know as we know

3494.24 --> 3499.1189999999997
it

3496.4 --> 3501.839
it's a what we knew is already gone

3499.119 --> 3505.119
that's already gone it's just people

3501.839 --> 3507.359
still holding on to but but what about

3505.119 --> 3508.96
actual civilization

3507.359 --> 3511.2799999999997
we have to hold on to that the

3508.96 --> 3514.079
government isn't oh yes that's how it

3511.28 --> 3516.4
works you hold on to civilization while

3514.079 --> 3518.319
government is literally starting to

3516.4 --> 3521.04
treat you like slaves

3518.319 --> 3522.64
mentally assaulting you

3521.04 --> 3525.52
abusing you

3522.64 --> 3529.2
destroying your culture yes let's hold

3525.52 --> 3531.359
on to civilization a little longer

3529.2 --> 3533.4399999999996
that that'll be effective tactic i mean

3531.359 --> 3535.68
that's not just going to do absolutely

3533.44 --> 3538.799
nothing

3535.68 --> 3542.0789999999997
make you waste more time as more people

3538.799 --> 3544.96
get assaulted and lose it

3542.079 --> 3547.28
our impoverished die

3544.96 --> 3547.28
yes

3548.319 --> 3551.799
let's do nothing

3573.359 --> 3578.0789999999997
freedoms will be restricted until morale

3575.599 --> 3578.079
improves

3580.079 --> 3584.0
i don't know

3581.92 --> 3584.839
i really don't know about this whole

3584.0 --> 3590.0
thing

3584.839 --> 3592.64
like i have not noticed any restrictions

3590.0 --> 3595.839

3592.64 --> 3595.839
so far nothing

3597.68 --> 3602.64
my youtube is right here it's still here

you guys realize that yeah

3602.64 --> 3608.64
all this all these people like oh i get

3606.16 --> 3610.319

3610.319 --> 3615.04
really

3611.599 --> 3618.6400000000003
well i say pretty much every word and i

3615.04 --> 3620.4
aim to like go over borders

3618.64 --> 3623.44
with that

3620.4 --> 3623.44
and i'm here

3623.839 --> 3629.599
and i'm doing that [ __ ] on a daily basis

3627.44 --> 3632.2400000000002
i don't even get strikes

3629.599 --> 3633.119
and this is youtube i'm on youtube doing

3632.24 --> 3635.2799999999997
this

3633.119 --> 3637.76
you understand every day

3635.28 --> 3640.799
all my shows are here

3637.76 --> 3640.7990000000004
so what's going on

3641.68 --> 3647.04
are we really restricted or are there a

3644.64 --> 3649.1189999999997
bunch of squirty [ __ ] out there

3647.04 --> 3650.48
they're like oh i'm under attack i'm

3649.119 --> 3651.88
under attack

3650.48 --> 3656.359
as a

3651.88 --> 3656.359
marketing scheme

3656.4 --> 3661.04
marketing scheme oh we're under attack

3659.2 --> 3662.24
we're so bad this and that

3661.04 --> 3664.48
yeah or

3662.24 --> 3665.52
it's just [ __ ]

3664.48 --> 3668.0
you just

3665.52 --> 3670.16
try to trigger

3668.0 --> 3672.24
some of those people politically and

3670.16 --> 3674.64
then they went after you

3672.24 --> 3677.04
because of that not because of what you

3674.64 --> 3678.4
said it's because of what you tried to

3677.04 --> 3681.119
do with it

3678.4 --> 3684.48
because i can say any [ __ ] thing i

3681.119 --> 3686.2400000000002
like and i can even draw it into violent

3684.48 --> 3688.48
descriptions

3686.24 --> 3691.5989999999997
and i don't get a strike

3688.48 --> 3694.319
you understand and i'm hyper critical

3691.599 --> 3697.92
of globalism of governments

3694.319 --> 3701.2799999999997
and i'm very brutal in my envisioned

3697.92 --> 3704.16
resolve and i'm right here i'm right

3701.28 --> 3706.2400000000002
here i'm not banned i'm not having a

3704.16 --> 3707.7599999999998
strike nothing

3706.24 --> 3711.2799999999997
nothing

3707.76 --> 3714.0
so it seems like complete [ __ ]

3711.28 --> 3717.119
marketing scheme to me oh we're getting

3714.0 --> 3717.119
banned we're getting banned

3717.359 --> 3721.839
or you're just

3719.119 --> 3725.359
trying to poke around hoping to get

3721.839 --> 3728.319
banned to use it as a feather on your

3725.359 --> 3731.68
[ __ ] little clown hats

3728.319 --> 3732.64
to get some popularity

3731.68 --> 3735.44
huh

3732.64 --> 3738.8799999999997
you actually have a point or is it just

3735.44 --> 3740.88
another standard narrative crappy little

3738.88 --> 3744.2400000000002
toe line

3740.88 --> 3744.2400000000002
what are you doing out there

3744.4 --> 3750.64
it's all [ __ ]

3747.76 --> 3752.8390000000004
there is no restrictions

3750.64 --> 3754.4
it's all a

3752.839 --> 3758.4
scam

3754.4 --> 3761.839
we are free we are free to do it all

3758.4 --> 3762.799
if you're going to poke people

3761.839 --> 3765.68
then

3762.799 --> 3767.0389999999998
if they have power they will poke back

3765.68 --> 3769.2
yeah

3767.039 --> 3771.92
it's not what i'm doing i'm actually

3769.2 --> 3774.48
exerting my free speech i'm not

3771.92 --> 3777.359
going to other people and threatening

3774.48 --> 3781.72
them directly to their face

3777.359 --> 3781.72
yeah that sort of [ __ ]

3782.079 --> 3786.4
like

3783.2 --> 3788.96
lawsuiting stuff yeah get that there has

3786.4 --> 3790.64
there's a point to that doing that

3788.96 --> 3793.28
attacking people judicially if they're

3790.64 --> 3795.2799999999997
actually criminal

3793.28 --> 3797.52
but

3795.28 --> 3800.2400000000002
all this free speech [ __ ]

3797.52 --> 3803.44
it's [ __ ] there is free speech i can

3800.24 --> 3807.2799999999997
literally say whatever the [ __ ] i want

3803.44 --> 3808.7200000000003
life right here on youtube

3807.28 --> 3812.7200000000003
no strikes

3808.72 --> 3812.72
it's all or [ __ ]

3812.96 --> 3817.079
all of it is horseshit

3832.4 --> 3835.359
okay i don't know what you're talking

3833.76 --> 3839.039
about george sanford

3835.359 --> 3841.839
videos removed emma what

3839.039 --> 3843.2000000000003
what what does that mean

3841.839 --> 3845.7599999999998
you made

3843.2 --> 3848.24
what you took a video of her and then

3845.76 --> 3850.559
you posted it on your channel yeah then

3848.24 --> 3853.2799999999997
they can copyright strike you

3850.559 --> 3857.3590000000004
yeah that's why i don't do that

3853.28 --> 3859.8390000000004
not without distinct permission

3857.359 --> 3863.839
don't do it with anybody

3859.839 --> 3868.5589999999997
especially people i don't respect

3863.839 --> 3868.5589999999997
ever yeah i don't get strikes

3870.0 --> 3874.24
owen benjamin would be here if he could

3872.24 --> 3876.72
yeah but he is a freaking comedian and

3874.24 --> 3879.4399999999996
he is like he

3876.72 --> 3881.839
his entire thing is to poke people on

3879.44 --> 3881.839
purpose

3882.96 --> 3887.359
and he's very unrelenting at it

3885.839 --> 3888.72
so

3887.359 --> 3891.359
yeah he's

3888.72 --> 3894.64
made to trigger people including people

3891.359 --> 3897.2
in power they fear him they're trying to

3894.64 --> 3897.2
ban him

3897.52 --> 3900.72
because

3898.64 --> 3904.48
of how he does it

3900.72 --> 3908.0
and he does go after people personally

3904.48 --> 3910.16
like with photos and all

3908.0 --> 3912.079
and he also does make

3910.16 --> 3913.44
[ __ ] up about them

3912.079 --> 3916.0
funny [ __ ]

3913.44 --> 3920.079
but he does make it up right

3916.0 --> 3920.079
so there is like i get that

3920.319 --> 3924.96
it's all personal

3922.559 --> 3927.28
it's personal don't you get it

3924.96 --> 3930.48
it's not because of what he says it's

3927.28 --> 3933.039
because it's personal

3930.48 --> 3935.839
because people in power

3933.039 --> 3938.2400000000002
took it personal

3935.839 --> 3940.48
then went after him

3938.24 --> 3943.9199999999996
it's not about what he did it's about

3940.48 --> 3943.92
what he did with it

3944.16 --> 3949.92
it's all personal there is no lack of

3947.92 --> 3951.599
freedom of speech you can literally say

3949.92 --> 3954.079
whatever you want

3951.599 --> 3956.4
but some people if you can't defend

3954.079 --> 3959.039
yourself against them spiritually then

3956.4 --> 3962.88
they will start to attack you

3959.039 --> 3965.119
using abusing the system against you

3962.88 --> 3967.839
that's not happening with me for some

3965.119 --> 3969.119
reason maybe it's because i'm pretty

3967.839 --> 3970.16
damn

3969.119 --> 3974.319
strong

3970.16 --> 3974.319
in ways very specific ways

3974.64 --> 3979.7599999999998
and they're just not doing that to me

3977.039 --> 3981.76
it's not happening

3979.76 --> 3984.7200000000003
see

3981.76 --> 3987.3590000000004
and i've even tried to push it at times

3984.72 --> 3988.3999999999996
like on purpose to push it to see like

3987.359 --> 3990.24
is this

3988.4 --> 3993.119
am i going too far now is somebody going

3990.24 --> 3996.0789999999997
to do anything about this

3993.119 --> 3999.7200000000003
no no they didn't

3996.079 --> 3999.7200000000003
so there you go

4015.359 --> 4019.52
right yeah logical yeah i had that one

4017.44 --> 4022.4
strike that's correct

4019.52 --> 4024.96
last year in november

4022.4 --> 4028.4
and it was because of the

4024.96 --> 4030.48
title see it was because of the title

4028.4 --> 4034.079
the title

4030.48 --> 4036.16
because i was before that and after that

4034.079 --> 4037.8390000000004
talking covet covered covert cove and

4036.16 --> 4040.0789999999997
vaccines is bad it's gonna kill you

4037.839 --> 4041.839
everybody that takes one's gonna die

4040.079 --> 4044.079
don't do it you're a murderer if you

4041.839 --> 4045.2
push that on someone yeah been talking

4044.079 --> 4047.52
about that

4045.2 --> 4049.68
all the time

4047.52 --> 4051.28
all the time

4049.68 --> 4053.5989999999997
months

4051.28 --> 4057.039
why did they take that one

4053.599 --> 4059.2000000000003
video down and gave me a strike

4057.039 --> 4060.8390000000004
because it was in the title you know

4059.2 --> 4064.96
what was in the

4060.839 --> 4068.24
title kovit was made up

4064.96 --> 4070.96
in a wuhan lab it was a joke

4068.24 --> 4074.16
but i had the words

4070.96 --> 4076.799
i was touching the narrative

4074.16 --> 4079.839
the system narrative i made a joke out

4076.799 --> 4082.64
of it but if i touched it nonetheless

4079.839 --> 4085.2
that's what they gave me a strike for

4082.64 --> 4088.64
for the title

4085.2 --> 4091.2799999999997
not what i was saying

4088.64 --> 4094.48
i don't think they even listen

4091.28 --> 4096.319
ever i think that they're terrified of

4094.48 --> 4098.4
the things that i suddenly out of

4096.319 --> 4100.4800000000005
nowhere bring forth in their face and

4098.4 --> 4102.5599999999995
then they can't unsee it i don't think

4100.48 --> 4104.959999999999
any of these freaks actually watch me

4102.56 --> 4107.279
because they're terrified of it they're

4104.96 --> 4109.12
terrified of what comes out of me

4107.279 --> 4113.56
good

4109.12 --> 4113.5599999999995
you should be terrified

4115.439 --> 4119.039000000001
[Music]

4122.14 --> 4125.1990000000005
[Music]

4124.08 --> 4128.0
yeah

4125.199 --> 4131.678999999999
so that's how i do it now

4128.0 --> 4133.759
just don't get click baiting

4131.679 --> 4135.279
system narrative

4133.759 --> 4137.359
titles

4135.279 --> 4140.319
oh you'll get all these clicks yeah and

4137.359 --> 4140.319
you'll get the strike

4140.56 --> 4146.64
don't do that don't use system narrative

4144.56 --> 4150.799
make your own

4146.64 --> 4153.12
don't try to be like that don't try

4150.799 --> 4156.88
to attention grab

4153.12 --> 4160.48
don't do that it's not yours it's theirs

4156.88 --> 4162.319
and they will strike you for it

4160.48 --> 4164.879999999999
just make up

4162.319 --> 4167.4400000000005
really interesting

4164.88 --> 4169.52
things that you

4167.44 --> 4171.2789999999995
are doing

4169.52 --> 4173.040000000001
that's what i've been doing haven't you

4171.279 --> 4175.120000000001
noticed my titles

4173.04 --> 4177.5199999999995
all my titles are like that all of them

4175.12 --> 4180.64
they're all

4177.52 --> 4183.4400000000005
concentrated information and nothing

4180.64 --> 4186.400000000001
about it has anything to do with any

4183.44 --> 4188.5599999999995
beast narrative you know it

4186.4 --> 4191.759
none of it has any

4188.56 --> 4194.159000000001
relating associating word of beast

4191.759 --> 4197.84
narrative in it

4194.159 --> 4199.679
yet i get pretty damn rough on my shows

4197.84 --> 4203.52
and i don't get a strike

4199.679 --> 4206.32
i don't because this is how it works

4203.52 --> 4207.84
all that idea oh they're gonna turquoise

4206.32 --> 4210.239
[ __ ]

4207.84 --> 4212.64
it's all [ __ ] you still have it it's

4210.239 --> 4215.199
right there

4212.64 --> 4217.6
you just have to know what the [ __ ]

4215.199 --> 4220.48
you're doing and not just attention

4217.6 --> 4222.400000000001
grabby blabber all over the place

4220.48 --> 4225.36
pretending like you're part of the beast

4222.4 --> 4227.679
system lending their narrative

4225.36 --> 4229.5199999999995
that's when you get into trouble just

4227.679 --> 4232.08
don't do that

4229.52 --> 4236.4800000000005
do your own thing

4232.08 --> 4236.48
and you'll not be getting strikes

4243.36 --> 4247.12
yeah now you know why your video got

4245.199 --> 4248.96
removed

4247.12 --> 4251.76
see

4248.96 --> 4254.0
i'm literally giving you the entire map

4251.76 --> 4257.0
of how to deal with this right now right

4254.0 --> 4257.0
here

4258.12 --> 4261.26
[Music]

4261.36 --> 4264.929999999999
oh you can get strikes oh really well

4263.84 --> 4266.8
i'm not getting any

4264.93 --> 4268.56
[Music]

4266.8 --> 4271.679
it's not like i

4268.56 --> 4272.8
tone it down or anything

4271.679 --> 4275.28
have i

4272.8 --> 4278.2390000000005
have i toned myself down

4275.28 --> 4278.239
since the strike

4281.36 --> 4284.159
i don't think so

4284.96 --> 4291.04
i mean i've had like one of my most most

4288.0 --> 4293.6
angry moments ever

4291.04 --> 4297.56
a few months ago

4293.6 --> 4297.56
or a month ago or so

4300.88 --> 4304.64
although it was much more restrained

4302.32 --> 4307.199
than the original 82 in which i was just

4304.64 --> 4309.84
completely like

4307.199 --> 4313.919999999999
foaming at the mouth

4309.84 --> 4316.0
but i was extremely intensely pissed off

4313.92 --> 4318.08
on camera here

4316.0 --> 4320.56
that didn't get a strike or anything it

4318.08 --> 4321.92
was literally just threatening

4320.56 --> 4323.92
like

4321.92 --> 4327.36
death

4323.92 --> 4330.4
on a whole category of people

4327.36 --> 4330.4
because of what they're doing

4332.0 --> 4335.76
that doesn't give you a strike

4338.32 --> 4344.159
it doesn't work how we are made to

4340.96 --> 4344.159
believe it works

4344.56 --> 4347.92
we're keeping

4345.92 --> 4352.4800000000005
ourselves in place with our own

4347.92 --> 4352.4800000000005
delusions about how this all works

4352.96 --> 4358.08
we're discouraged by our own collective

4355.6 --> 4358.08
myths

4364.48 --> 4369.839999999999
how i modified my behavior not to get

4367.28 --> 4372.4
strikes no that's not what i did i've

4369.84 --> 4374.64
not modified what i do on camera that

4372.4 --> 4376.48
was my point m appeal i haven't done

4374.64 --> 4377.76
that what i said is

4376.48 --> 4380.4
look

4377.76 --> 4382.64
it's the title

4380.4 --> 4384.5599999999995
they don't want you to use beast

4382.64 --> 4385.92
narrative when they're in the middle of

4384.56 --> 4387.92
a spell

4385.92 --> 4389.6
that's what they go after you for

4387.92 --> 4393.4400000000005
there's nothing to do with what i'm

4389.6 --> 4393.4400000000005
talking about right here

4394.0 --> 4397.76
yeah that

4395.84 --> 4399.4400000000005
is completely free

4397.76 --> 4402.159000000001
unrestricted

4399.44 --> 4406.599999999999
it's the title

4402.159 --> 4406.599999999999
it's not modifying my behavior

4421.679 --> 4424.0
right

4425.04 --> 4429.12
um like

4426.56 --> 4431.4400000000005
the way i present myself how i do things

4429.12 --> 4435.76
when i allow myself to do things and

4431.44 --> 4435.759999999999
express myself has that changed no

4435.84 --> 4441.4400000000005
i dare i say i probably become more

4439.199 --> 4444.719
aggressive

4441.44 --> 4444.719
since i got that strike

4445.52 --> 4450.1990000000005
yeah more aggressive on average

4456.8 --> 4463.28
but yeah the titles are the titles the

4460.239 --> 4464.799999999999
titles are not my behavior the titles is

4463.28 --> 4466.96
a title

4464.8 --> 4469.76
i use titles mostly

4466.96 --> 4472.96
this is for real i use titles to

4469.76 --> 4475.280000000001
remember moments in the show

4472.96 --> 4477.28
for myself so that when i scroll through

4475.28 --> 4479.5199999999995
it i can see the title be like oh yeah

4477.28 --> 4481.679
that was that show

4479.52 --> 4485.52
that's what i use the titles for mostly

4481.679 --> 4488.0
to remember great ideas and concepts and

4485.52 --> 4490.120000000001
tying it so i can show remember which

4488.0 --> 4493.92
show it was because a freaking

4490.12 --> 4495.76
1225 shows that so many shows you think

4493.92 --> 4497.12
i know everything that happened in all

4495.76 --> 4498.719
of that

4497.12 --> 4501.84
all the time no

4498.719 --> 4501.84
it's way too much

4502.0 --> 4506.88
but good titles

4503.84 --> 4507.84
especially for important shows helps a

4506.88 --> 4509.679
lot

4507.84 --> 4512.400000000001
when it scrolls by that i understand

4509.679 --> 4512.4
what it's about

4520.08 --> 4525.04
to be careful about my titles now

4522.8 --> 4527.4400000000005
no

4525.04 --> 4531.5199999999995
i just don't try

4527.44 --> 4534.96
to grab attention by playing on beast

4531.52 --> 4534.96
system narrative

4536.08 --> 4539.84
i never did that all the time in the

4538.48 --> 4542.879999999999
first place

4539.84 --> 4545.6
it's just like a side trick that i could

4542.88 --> 4547.84
do and it's like yeah let's do this

4545.6 --> 4549.1990000000005
it was attention grabbing i did it on

4547.84 --> 4550.84
purpose

4549.199 --> 4553.12
it was in

4550.84 --> 4555.76
there yeah

4553.12 --> 4559.04
and i don't do that anymore i don't like

4555.76 --> 4562.1990000000005
i don't just make every [ __ ] thing i

4559.04 --> 4564.64
do now about oh look at me

4562.199 --> 4567.12
reconstructing the beast narrative to be

4564.64 --> 4570.0
all comedic yeah i could probably do

4567.12 --> 4572.8
that i don't think it would really be

4570.0 --> 4575.679
good for anything i probably feel very

4572.8 --> 4577.28
cool right like oh man i'm such a badass

4575.679 --> 4580.64
i could do that yeah

4577.28 --> 4582.0
and i couldn't do that on youtube

4580.64 --> 4584.08
that sort of thing i couldn't do in

4582.0 --> 4584.84
youtube because technically yeah i could

4584.08 --> 4586.64
just

4584.84 --> 4589.6
constantly

4586.64 --> 4592.2390000000005
non-stop every word i say [ __ ] around

4589.6 --> 4594.56
with the system narrative and to [ __ ] it

4592.239 --> 4597.04
over to make it as embarrassing and

4594.56 --> 4599.92
idiotic and just worth

4597.04 --> 4602.239
committing suicide as possible every

4599.92 --> 4605.12
[ __ ] word i use i would do that i

4602.239 --> 4608.32
could do that technically do i want to

4605.12 --> 4611.36
do that

4608.32 --> 4614.0
no not really

4611.36 --> 4615.839999999999
i actually find what i do right here and

4614.0 --> 4617.679
the way that i do it much more

4615.84 --> 4620.0
productive on the long run because i'm

4617.679 --> 4622.96
actually digging up gems

4620.0 --> 4624.64
i'm much more engaged in science

4622.96 --> 4628.56
i'm not just like oh look at what the

4624.64 --> 4632.159000000001
crazy sjw or this president or this

4628.56 --> 4635.679
weirdo trans health minister did now and

4632.159 --> 4638.0
just [ __ ] around with that nonstop

4635.679 --> 4640.8
yeah i would always be able to fill

4638.0 --> 4642.239
screen time right always

4640.8 --> 4644.56
oh yeah

4642.239 --> 4647.599999999999
but who would give a [ __ ] anymore after

4644.56 --> 4651.76
some point right because there's already

4647.6 --> 4655.360000000001
thousands of people doing exactly that

4651.76 --> 4655.360000000001
and it's getting kind of lame

4655.92 --> 4661.1990000000005
i mean there's only a few that are like

4658.08 --> 4661.199
really good at it

4661.28 --> 4666.08
most of the time it's just lame it's

4664.4 --> 4668.32
like yeah yeah yeah yeah we know what

4666.08 --> 4670.5599999999995
the [ __ ] are you gonna do about it [ __ ]

4668.32 --> 4673.36
stop complaining all the time what are

4670.56 --> 4673.360000000001
you gonna do about it

4674.56 --> 4679.4400000000005
you're not smart for pointing out how

4677.04 --> 4684.08
much you're being raped yeah that does

4679.44 --> 4684.08
make you smart that makes you a [ __ ]

4685.36 --> 4690.88
yeah instead of describing in in the

4688.159 --> 4694.0
utmost detail exactly how you're being

4690.88 --> 4697.04
tortured and raped by some freak

4694.0 --> 4702.12
why don't you [ __ ] do something

4697.04 --> 4702.12
against it with your hands

4714.159 --> 4717.159
ah

4724.0 --> 4727.6
all trying to say about modified

4725.679 --> 4731.1990000000005
behavior yeah well i i'm not gonna seek

4727.6 --> 4731.1990000000005
out getting strikes i'm appeal

4731.28 --> 4736.96
so what the hell are you expecting

4734.48 --> 4740.4
that i just like who they gave me a

4736.96 --> 4742.96
strike let's do it again be in protest

4740.4 --> 4746.839999999999
yeah oh yeah let's throw away my entire

4742.96 --> 4749.6
channel i mean i only got like

4746.84 --> 4752.159000000001
1300 shows

4749.6 --> 4754.56
exclusively here that i can't even all

4752.159 --> 4757.759999999999
download on my computer

4754.56 --> 4759.84
yeah let's just throw it away

4757.76 --> 4761.679
because i'm a stubborn [ __ ] that

4759.84 --> 4764.96
doesn't actually figure out what's going

4761.679 --> 4766.32
on and how to avoid that sort of [ __ ]

4764.96 --> 4768.4
something that i didn't really

4766.32 --> 4769.92
necessarily want to do in the first

4768.4 --> 4770.639999999999
place

4769.92 --> 4772.8
just

4770.64 --> 4774.88
like that one title i was just being as

4772.8 --> 4777.1990000000005
smart as

4774.88 --> 4780.0
kovit is made up in a wuhan lab yeah

4777.199 --> 4782.5599999999995
that's me being a smart ass

4780.0 --> 4786.12
that got me a strike that's it

4782.56 --> 4786.120000000001
that's it

4815.199 --> 4818.678999999999
okay i'm appeal

4822.639 --> 4826.56
i don't see how you're gonna be forced

4824.4 --> 4829.5599999999995
to wear a mask but

4826.56 --> 4829.56
okay

4834.08 --> 4840.5599999999995
you can always do footnote and i don't

4836.719 --> 4842.639
need to do anything to avoid a strike

4840.56 --> 4845.92
do i look like i've been avoiding a

4842.639 --> 4847.76
strike in the last few months guys for

4845.92 --> 4849.679
real

4847.76 --> 4853.1990000000005
do i look like somebody that's been

4849.679 --> 4853.1990000000005
trying to avoid a strike

4856.32 --> 4861.84
i'd like you all in chat to answer that

4874.88 --> 4878.1990000000005
there you go

4890.719 --> 4894.8
forced to wear my yeah but i'm appeal

4892.719 --> 4896.8
you could have literally

4894.8 --> 4899.28
gave them like medical reasons and they

4896.8 --> 4903.08
wouldn't even be allowed to ask about it

4899.28 --> 4903.08
why didn't you do that

4903.12 --> 4907.599999999999
you really can't be forced to wear a

4905.199 --> 4909.599999999999
mask but you've got to be serious if

4907.6 --> 4912.0
you're going to be like oh

4909.6 --> 4914.84
why are you mean to me yeah then they're

4912.0 --> 4918.239
going to be like yeah do it do it

4914.84 --> 4920.2390000000005
now if you're like you're not going to

4918.239 --> 4922.239
do that to me and you're not going to

4920.239 --> 4924.08
fire me over this

4922.239 --> 4926.239
then just pile it on like i have

4924.08 --> 4928.8
legitimate reasons not to do this you

4926.239 --> 4931.44
can't stop me like you could even go as

4928.8 --> 4934.0
far as like if you try to stop me i will

4931.44 --> 4936.32
sue you personally

4934.0 --> 4936.32
yeah

4936.639 --> 4941.1990000000005
have you ever tried that

4939.199 --> 4944.159
they're gonna [ __ ] let you in without

4941.199 --> 4946.799999999999
a mask

4944.159 --> 4949.08
like those [ __ ] retards that force

4946.8 --> 4952.639
masks on people they're all

4949.08 --> 4955.12
terrified of the law and of people that

4952.639 --> 4958.639
dare to go there they're terrified of

4955.12 --> 4961.84
those people just threaten them to say

4958.639 --> 4964.2390000000005
dude get out of my [ __ ] way or i'm

4961.84 --> 4968.1990000000005
suing you personally

4964.239 --> 4968.199
they're gonna let you go

4973.52 --> 4978.320000000001
you don't have to even have medical

4976.0 --> 4980.32
records m appeal that's the point you

4978.32 --> 4983.84
only have to tell them you have medical

4980.32 --> 4986.4
exemption they're not allowed

4983.84 --> 4987.92
to ask you about it yeah

4986.4 --> 4991.92
it's not that you don't have to tell

4987.92 --> 4993.4400000000005
them they're not allowed to legally ask

4991.92 --> 4994.8
you about them

4993.44 --> 4997.28
if they do

4994.8 --> 4998.320000000001
then you literally have a point right

4997.28 --> 5000.08
there

4998.32 --> 5002.719
that you could tell i'm like yeah i can

5000.08 --> 5005.679
literally sue you with this yeah are you

5002.719 --> 5008.0
gonna let me go or i will sue you with

5005.679 --> 5012.04
this on record that you asked something

5008.0 --> 5012.04
that you're not allowed to

5019.6 --> 5023.280000000001
sorry by the way i'm appeal i don't want

5021.44 --> 5025.199
to i'm not trying to hammer on you

5023.28 --> 5026.639
personally i'm just a little riled up in

5025.199 --> 5028.4
general

5026.639 --> 5030.56
i'm just saying like there's no real

5028.4 --> 5033.28
excuse

5030.56 --> 5033.280000000001
not really

5034.4 --> 5040.4
if you've been forced to wear a mask

5036.96 --> 5042.4800000000005
that simply means you gave up

5040.4 --> 5043.92
and you didn't understand

5042.48 --> 5045.759999999999
that

5043.92 --> 5047.76
if people are going to try to force you

5045.76 --> 5050.719
to do that they're going to be terrified

5047.76 --> 5052.639
of the law understand the law

5050.719 --> 5054.88
understand what's going on and then tell

5052.639 --> 5059.679
them like you can't stop me or i will

5054.88 --> 5062.08
sue you and they'll [ __ ] their pants

5059.679 --> 5064.32
like they're not going to not [ __ ] their

5062.08 --> 5067.04
pants you see because they're wearing

5064.32 --> 5069.599999999999
masks and trying to force that on people

5067.04 --> 5072.88
if they're doing that then they will

5069.6 --> 5074.4800000000005
[ __ ] their pants if you actually

5072.88 --> 5077.76
tell them that you're gonna sue them and

5074.48 --> 5081.599999999999
mean it right you gotta have the papers

5077.76 --> 5083.52
to make it actual not just a bluff

5081.6 --> 5085.6
you have to have that option available

5083.52 --> 5088.080000000001
to actually do it

5085.6 --> 5090.320000000001
technically not that you would want to

5088.08 --> 5092.8
but you have to be able to and

5090.32 --> 5093.759999999999
demonstrate that to them they'll let you

5092.8 --> 5096.08
go

5093.76 --> 5098.8

5096.08 --> 5101.12
their pants really easily

5098.8 --> 5104.159000000001
you just have to have control over the

5101.12 --> 5106.96
situation they don't that's why they're

5104.159 --> 5109.12
in that spot that's why they are wearing

5106.96 --> 5111.84
masks and trying to force it on people

5109.12 --> 5116.88
because they don't have control so show

5111.84 --> 5116.88
them you have control and take power

5117.12 --> 5122.159
let me through

5118.88 --> 5126.4400000000005
and keep your damn masks to yourself or

5183.28 --> 5189.12
adam price okay well that's just like

5186.159 --> 5191.679
wearing a mask because a crazy person

5189.12 --> 5193.36
that's like the opposite that's like

5191.679 --> 5194.96
that's what happens from the other side

5193.36 --> 5197.92
that's how they will get you to wear a

5194.96 --> 5199.199
mask by pure insane

5197.92 --> 5201.679
violence

5199.199 --> 5203.919999999999
although i do think that those people

5201.679 --> 5207.52
would like

5203.92 --> 5209.1990000000005
nah shouldn't go there it's just that

5207.52 --> 5210.88
you could test them

5209.199 --> 5213.12
see if they would do that and then you

5210.88 --> 5215.4400000000005
could literally just kill them tell them

5213.12 --> 5217.36
yeah it was self-defense because it was

5215.44 --> 5218.48
they're actually gonna try to bash your

5217.36 --> 5220.4
head in with

5218.48 --> 5221.678999999999
a can

5220.4 --> 5223.28
then yeah

5221.679 --> 5225.84
i don't know depending on the location

5223.28 --> 5228.4
where you pretty much have the the right

5225.84 --> 5229.92
to respond lethally

5228.4 --> 5231.5199999999995
right

5229.92 --> 5235.28
i think at that point that would be a

5231.52 --> 5239.84
service to the general public

5235.28 --> 5239.84
a disgusting service but still

5250.0 --> 5253.84
just to wear polka dotted

5269.44 --> 5274.239
now there you go pgsc net well done

5272.159 --> 5276.638999999999
see that's how you do it you just have

5274.239 --> 5279.04
to hold firm you have to know the law

5276.639 --> 5281.12
you have to hold firm

5279.04 --> 5282.719
and if they get like threatening or

5281.12 --> 5284.239
anything

5282.719 --> 5285.679
are they just like

5284.239 --> 5288.159
then you're like oh yeah i've legal

that's that is the way to do with it

5305.679 --> 5310.4
it really is but it does require yeah

5308.4 --> 5312.5599999999995
some strength of character to go there

5310.4 --> 5315.12
and preparation

5312.56 --> 5316.88
it means you can't just randomly walk

5315.12 --> 5319.36
into stuff thinking that everything will

5316.88 --> 5320.84
just work out fine

5319.36 --> 5325.199
you have to think about what you're

5320.84 --> 5325.1990000000005
doing what you're going to be facing

5329.44 --> 5335.159

about it because you could lose

okay seeking oh okay that sounds

5435.92 --> 5438.639
complicated

5439.12 --> 5444.88
oh that sucks as a business arrangement

5441.28 --> 5444.88
like that totally sucks

5447.6 --> 5454.400000000001
like what the hell kind of a business is

5450.0 --> 5454.4
that anyway where literally the employee

5454.56 --> 5459.84
is complete the employer

5456.639 --> 5463.76
damn it which one is it

5459.84 --> 5466.159000000001
they always mix it up employee

5463.76 --> 5468.8
the yi is the one

5466.159 --> 5471.679
taking the job right

5468.8 --> 5474.08
your is the one giving the job

5471.679 --> 5476.4
freaking out i always [ __ ] mix those

5474.08 --> 5478.48
up in my head so annoying

5476.4 --> 5482.0
right so

5478.48 --> 5482.0
if the employer

5483.12 --> 5488.159
like if you can't do anything

5485.76 --> 5490.8
against them like if you can't sue them

5488.159 --> 5492.879999999999
in any way then what the hell kind of a

5490.8 --> 5495.52
business arrangement is that that's

5492.88 --> 5498.719
preposterous like why would you do that

5495.52 --> 5501.679
why would you be subjected to that type

5498.719 --> 5505.84
of unconditional situation it's micro

5501.679 --> 5505.84
slavery why would you do that

5506.239 --> 5509.28
like when they technically can do

5507.76 --> 5510.8
whatever the [ __ ] they want and there's

5509.28 --> 5513.599999999999
nothing you can do about it that's

5510.8 --> 5513.6
ridiculous

5514.239 --> 5520.08
employers should be

5517.52 --> 5521.6
held accountable to their actions

5520.08 --> 5523.679
through a system

5521.6 --> 5525.92
if that there's a clause that you can't

5523.679 --> 5530.36
do that then why the hell would you

5525.92 --> 5530.36
be an employee to that

5535.06 --> 5538.219
[Music]

5543.6 --> 5547.04
worker cannot sue owner that's

ridiculous

5547.04 --> 5554.32
why not

5548.96 --> 5556.96
if a person can sue another person

5554.32 --> 5559.44
why couldn't a worker sue an owner

5556.96 --> 5564.12
that makes no sense

[Music]

5579.92 --> 5585.36
yeah i agree pj seen it

5582.639 --> 5587.84
and yes it can be super annoying because

5585.36 --> 5588.88
oh what if oh you're very unpopular and

5587.84 --> 5590.639
then

5588.88 --> 5594.400000000001
oh that's not true because it's still up

5590.639 --> 5596.159000000001
to you to who you're going to allow in

5594.4 --> 5598.719
so you're going to have to be very good

5596.159 --> 5600.638999999999
to basically prevent political opponents

5598.719 --> 5602.8
from sneaking in your company and then

5600.639 --> 5605.6
start suing you but technically that

5602.8 --> 5608.2390000000005
isn't even necessary because they could

5605.6 --> 5610.639
still sue you as an outsider so there's

5608.239 --> 5613.919999999999
there's just no logical reason to even

5610.639 --> 5616.32

and yeah he had some interesting

5655.0 --> 5659.52
preliminary ideas here and there right

5658.08 --> 5661.6
it's kind of the same thing that i do

5659.52 --> 5663.84
preliminary it is a look like a

potential spectrum between knowing and

the substance within an experiment yeah

5668.88 --> 5672.88
yeah

he does that a little too and then he

things you should be doing and you

5714.159 --> 5718.719
should not be doing

transparent that's why you don't see

6229.119 --> 6232.719
them anymore it's not

6230.96 --> 6236.719
any kind of chemtrail that's the entire

6232.719 --> 6236.719
point that's how you identify them

6239.84 --> 6245.1990000000005
he does no reification

6243.04 --> 6248.48
excuse me

6245.199 --> 6248.48
blasting scientists

6249.199 --> 6254.159
scratcher

6251.28 --> 6254.159
oh my god

6257.92 --> 6262.639
he's thinking about becoming a flat

6260.639 --> 6265.52
earth now what

6262.639 --> 6265.52
no he's not

6266.08 --> 6271.119
and if he is like oh yeah he's kind of

6268.48 --> 6275.199
late like kind of late to the game now

6271.119 --> 6277.04
isn't he i mean only seven years late

6275.199 --> 6280.08
woohoo

6277.04 --> 6280.08
took your time then

6283.92 --> 6288.52
you wouldn't say it in public shoot

6289.119 --> 6293.679
oh my god i don't care if it's just

6291.6 --> 6295.1990000000005
gonna be another bob arthur then who

6293.679 --> 6297.52
gives a [ __ ]

6295.199 --> 6302.119
[ __ ] ken wheeler

6297.52 --> 6302.119000000001
i'm sorry i i don't care

6302.4 --> 6307.5199999999995
like i don't have a single thing that

6304.88 --> 6309.76
like came from him that's like oh that

6307.52 --> 6312.0
changed everything i built everything i

6309.76 --> 6314.2390000000005
thought up on that

6312.0 --> 6314.239
no

6314.84 --> 6319.76
no i mean he had an interesting idea

6318.8 --> 6321.4400000000005
about

6319.76 --> 6323.119000000001
how

6321.44 --> 6325.5199999999995
like the elected

6323.119 --> 6325.5199999999995
damn it

6325.6 --> 6330.4800000000005
how the presupposed electron

6329.199 --> 6332.32
is like

6330.48 --> 6334.48
two different forms where it's like

6332.32 --> 6337.5199999999995
magnetic

6334.48 --> 6340.32
and like separated like i liked his

6337.52 --> 6341.92
electrics idea on the microscope like

6340.32 --> 6342.96
that's

6341.92 --> 6347.119
it's a

6342.96 --> 6348.56
concept that is worth considering right

6347.119 --> 6350.48
that's it

6348.56 --> 6353.1990000000005
that's the only thing that i've ever

6350.48 --> 6355.599999999999
seen from him where i was like yeah

6353.199 --> 6358.799999999999
not bad that that might be it

6355.6 --> 6360.719
it's just one thing click like oh yeah

6358.8 --> 6362.88
yeah that makes sense right it was

6360.719 --> 6365.44
technically already applied it's just

6362.88 --> 6368.96
now he's found out

6365.44 --> 6368.96
a way to explain that

6369.6 --> 6373.76
i'm like yeah sure

6371.76 --> 6376.159000000001
that's pretty good

6373.76 --> 6378.0
i mean is that

6376.159 --> 6380.5599999999995
worth

6378.0 --> 6384.56
thinking he's like this really smart

6380.56 --> 6384.56
super guy because he did that

6385.679 --> 6391.679
i don't think so

6387.84 --> 6391.679
i'm not that impressed really

6399.119 --> 6405.08
what's with the caps here flat sabbath

6401.44 --> 6405.08
don't do that please

6423.04 --> 6426.44
look at that

6437.679 --> 6441.4400000000005
don't know who he is dan you don't know

6439.679 --> 6443.84
who ken wheeler is

6441.44 --> 6443.839999999999
really

6444.96 --> 6448.719
dude you'd so drown in what he's talking

6447.52 --> 6451.1990000000005
about

6448.719 --> 6453.44
i know you you would totally drown in

6451.199 --> 6453.44
him

6454.56 --> 6460.0
i mean the guy is like a he's master

6457.6 --> 6462.2390000000005
technobabbling okay he is a master at

6460.0 --> 6462.239
that

6462.88 --> 6467.36
like unlike some people that kind of

6465.04 --> 6469.44
like to do that to sound smarter he

6467.36 --> 6471.28
likes really good at it's like he's been

6469.44 --> 6472.638999999999
doing that all his life

6471.28 --> 6475.5199999999995
probably

6472.639 --> 6477.6
and it's probably also bound to an ego

6475.52 --> 6480.159000000001
insecurity issue because that is what

6477.6 --> 6482.0
would make you techno babble

6480.159 --> 6485.44
all your life and perfect it to that

6482.0 --> 6487.92
level the only an ego issue can actually

6485.44 --> 6487.919999999999
do that

6492.239 --> 6499.28
but yeah doesn't actually help you

6496.719 --> 6502.719
give a grip or communicate an actual

6499.28 --> 6505.119
grip on how things work not really it's

6502.719 --> 6506.88
just it sounds like you're really smart

6505.119 --> 6510.639
when you do it

6506.88 --> 6512.639
reifications are very easily folded into

6510.639 --> 6514.56
those explanations and you won't be able

6512.639 --> 6515.4400000000005
to catch on because the techno babble

6514.56 --> 6517.119000000001
just

6515.44 --> 6519.199
dazzles you

6517.119 --> 6522.5599999999995
that's what he does that's what techno

6519.199 --> 6525.678999999999
babblers do they make you dazzle

6522.56 --> 6528.4800000000005
with complicated words and references

6525.679 --> 6530.88
to distract you from the reification

6528.48 --> 6534.678999999999
connections that they also slip in

6530.88 --> 6534.679
that's how that works

6542.159 --> 6544.96
fuzzy fe

6547.199 --> 6550.08
what are you guys talking about you're

6548.719 --> 6553.88
talking about something completely

6550.08 --> 6553.88
different jet engines

6554.8 --> 6559.52
i guess that's still in response to the

6556.719 --> 6561.04
chemtrail question

6559.52 --> 6564.88
yeah i'm not gonna address that now

6561.04 --> 6564.88
however i'm gonna round out the show

6565.199 --> 6569.839999999999
sorry about that

6567.119 --> 6569.839999999999
anyway

6570.08 --> 6574.8
today was a good show

6571.76 --> 6577.04
i think i only really pissed off only a

6574.8 --> 6580.400000000001
couple of people

6577.04 --> 6580.4
at least not everybody

6581.199 --> 6585.04
but i do always do that for some reason

6583.44 --> 6586.5599999999995
it's like yeah all these people they've

6585.04 --> 6589.04
been following me for months but then

6586.56 --> 6591.599
for some reason in certain days

6589.04 --> 6594.56
i just pissed them off

6591.599 --> 6596.88
and it keeps happening to new people

6594.56 --> 6599.76
waves after waves

6596.88 --> 6599.76
i don't know why

6600.0 --> 6603.36
it always keeps happening

6605.92 --> 6610.56
most words spoken and flat earth early

6608.56 --> 6613.04
bird history

6610.56 --> 6615.4400000000005
i don't know about that but certainly a

6613.04 --> 6617.36
lot of talk today also from my side and

6615.44 --> 6618.96
been very chatty

6617.36 --> 6621.199
right

6618.96 --> 6623.44
i guess it's a side effect of my

6621.199 --> 6625.28
my jaw like really getting healed up and

6623.44 --> 6628.0
all that because it's been really

6625.28 --> 6630.239
nagging for a while

6628.0 --> 6632.88
like even before the

6630.239 --> 6634.08
the inflammation and all that came back

6632.88 --> 6635.119
right

6634.08 --> 6637.199
anyway

6635.119 --> 6638.719
thanks everybody for coming i hope you

6637.199 --> 6641.36
like this show

6638.719 --> 6644.2390000000005
if you didn't then yeah

6641.36 --> 6647.119
probably a couple of trigger points here

6644.239 --> 6650.08
and there can't really help you too much

6647.119 --> 6653.04
i've been honest about all of it

6650.08 --> 6655.119
i don't pile on more

6653.04 --> 6657.36
than i need to than i see

6655.119 --> 6659.28
than what i actually see being the

6657.36 --> 6660.639
problem in there

6659.28 --> 6662.48
so

6660.639 --> 6664.56
just pretty straightforward i hope

6662.48 --> 6666.5599999999995
you'll be able to deal with it anyway if
