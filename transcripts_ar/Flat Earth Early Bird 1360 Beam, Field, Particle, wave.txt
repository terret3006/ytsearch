kiwi was bullying with it

328.08 --> 331.59999999999997
well he was just like really grinding

330.24 --> 336.0
down

331.6 --> 336.0
heavy style like he would do with

336.16 --> 340.8
anti-flat earthers but it was a bit much

338.88 --> 344.4
i didn't actually listen to the whole

340.8 --> 346.639
thing i watched a gym bob show in

344.4 --> 349.28
between and was in the chat there

346.639 --> 351.28000000000003
because it just couldn't

349.28 --> 353.44
just thinking about it back just almost

351.28 --> 355.98999999999995
makes me sick not because it was so

353.44 --> 359.569
horrific it's just all that pressure

355.99 --> 359.569
[Music]

363.6 --> 368.47900000000004
i mean there's a lot going on in the

365.84 --> 372.79999999999995
background that

368.479 --> 372.8
we're only just guessing towards

375.039 --> 381.36
but yeah tension is building

378.24 --> 383.039
and yeah i'm not exactly enjoying it i

381.36 --> 384.04
really just kind of want some peace and

383.039 --> 386.639
quiet

384.04 --> 389.96000000000004

401.51 --> 408.8
[Music]

405.84 --> 412.479
it's 90 degrees celsius so

408.8 --> 412.479
all right same as yesterday

415.6 --> 420.24
it's according to the prediction it's

417.6 --> 423.759
gonna be a pause from the rain until

420.24 --> 427.8
tuesday okay

423.759 --> 427.8
may even get a little warmer

440.25 --> 443.36
[Music]

444.479 --> 447.28
right so i'm going to be probably

446.08 --> 451.52
walking out

447.28 --> 453.19899999999996
a couple of times because i just feel

451.52 --> 455.44
weird again

453.199 --> 459.96000000000004
i mean but today's can be a very long

455.44 --> 459.96
show so it's gonna get better i promise

464.0 --> 468.4
had some inner food already that did

466.16 --> 468.40000000000003
help

468.8 --> 473.319
but still i just feel like this

490.4 --> 493.4
right

494.6 --> 502.639
[Music]

500.639 --> 504.56
will you spend some time out in the sun

502.639 --> 507.28000000000003
today

504.56 --> 509.52
i kind of do feel like it

507.28 --> 511.039
i did wanted to wanted to take a walk

509.52 --> 512.56
earlier but then it seemed like it was

511.039 --> 515.56
going to rain so i kind of didn't do

512.56 --> 515.56
that

525.68 --> 531.4799999999999
hey gorzilla

527.279 --> 531.48
37 good to you

534.0 --> 539.76
uh

536.28 --> 539.76
[Music]

553.12 --> 556.48
right yeah that happened

556.56 --> 559.3599999999999
thank you elise

559.6 --> 563.839
like apparently the surfer had a major

561.92 --> 566.0799999999999
attack

563.839 --> 568.0
and i wonder now if it was actually the

566.08 --> 571.36
guy yesterday that was trolling me

568.0 --> 573.279
because he seemed to threaten me

571.36 --> 576.519
in some unspoken way like he was gonna

573.279 --> 576.519
do something

577.44 --> 583.5500000000001
it's just a really miserable thing to do

580.64 --> 586.75
really [ __ ] miserable

583.55 --> 586.75
[Music]

591.839 --> 596.48
right so i hope that this gilded system

594.08 --> 598.399
is going to work out better

596.48 --> 601.3000000000001
than the discord which i never really

598.399 --> 606.47
liked anyway

601.3 --> 606.4699999999999
[Music]

610.05 --> 614.0899999999999
[Music]

617.74 --> 626.36
[Music]

623.36 --> 626.36
okay

637.12 --> 642.32
it's funny though in a way because

640.16 --> 646.0
now that they're using this gilded

642.32 --> 648.399
system i might actually consider just

646.0 --> 651.2
getting it an option for a panel on the

648.399 --> 651.2
side that way

654.64 --> 660.0
i'm just gonna see how it works though

657.279 --> 663.0
for a while before i get to deciding on

660.0 --> 663.0
that

674.48 --> 680.32
right oh man yeah flat side perspective

677.68 --> 683.5999999999999
did you see like that

680.32 --> 683.6
video review that

684.72 --> 688.839
was it hold on

691.279 --> 696.079
i was watching that before this john

693.519 --> 697.519
thor uploaded like david weiss going it

696.079 --> 700.0
up against

697.519 --> 704.399
professor dave

700.0 --> 707.279
and he had a pretty hilarious commentary

704.399 --> 709.839
the guy that he basically mirrored there

707.279 --> 709.8389999999999
john thor

710.72 --> 718.0790000000001
yeah it was pretty hilarious but jesus

713.76 --> 718.079
i mean professor dave is just so

718.32 --> 722.8000000000001
out of left field it's just surreal

723.279 --> 729.12
but it was very doable with the with the

726.079 --> 730.65
yeah the comedic commentary

729.12 --> 732.16
the laughing really helped

730.65 --> 734.56
[Music]

732.16 --> 739.8
because if it was just the raw thing it

734.56 --> 739.8
would be like really aggravating just

741.54 --> 744.7099999999999
[Music]

747.76 --> 750.079
huh

752.56 --> 757.3199999999999
okay bjc now that's very interesting

758.2 --> 763.98
[Music]

762.24 --> 767.44
so

763.98 --> 767.44
[Music]

777.44 --> 782.0790000000001
right so yeah a lot of things are

779.6 --> 782.0790000000001
happening

783.68 --> 789.279
queen of england dies

785.519 --> 792.5600000000001
discord server dies

789.279 --> 792.56
hope nothing else dies

798.959 --> 805.8389999999999
especially my bank account

802.079 --> 805.8389999999999
because my rent did get upped

807.2 --> 812.5600000000001
pretty dramatically

809.68 --> 815.8389999999999
as i had the super stressed out show

812.56 --> 815.8389999999999
about pretty much

822.0 --> 829.8
what discord server the

824.0 --> 829.8
qefed discord server terry 306

835.41 --> 838.4599999999999
[Music]

843.76 --> 846.16

holy [ __ ]

859.92 --> 862.88
okay

861.199 --> 865.519
yeah anime can just

862.88 --> 867.8389999999999
shared a page he got out of a book that

865.519 --> 868.9590000000001
says that the queen elizabeth ii will

867.839 --> 872.6
die

868.959 --> 872.5999999999999
circa 2022

872.959 --> 875.76
holy [ __ ]

877.199 --> 881.519
i should probably

878.72 --> 885.839
share that just

881.519 --> 885.839
because of how amazing that is

896.72 --> 903.36
so yeah look at this

899.67 --> 907.51
[Music]

903.36 --> 910.61
and thank you adam for sharing

907.51 --> 910.61
[Music]

919.279 --> 922.88
i don't know what book he got that from

921.04 --> 927.3199999999999
by the way

922.88 --> 927.32
but yeah that is pretty astonishing

940.32 --> 942.639
right

945.28 --> 949.92
[Music]

947.04 --> 951.36
oh the nostradamus

949.92 --> 954.36
really

951.36 --> 954.36
okay

964.81 --> 967.9699999999999
[Music]

969.199 --> 973.12
well that's gonna make some gunpowder go

971.44 --> 975.6
off out there

973.12 --> 978.6
in occult land

975.6 --> 978.6
sheesh

993.6 --> 996.6
oh

999.37 --> 1008.48
[Music]

1005.44 --> 1011.12
expect rv to go full rv about this so

1008.48 --> 1013.04
yeah no [ __ ] this is

1011.12 --> 1015.279
i guarantee it

1013.04 --> 1015.279
and

1015.6 --> 1021.0400000000001
in a way it's like

1017.44 --> 1024.24
yeah it better than in fighting i'd say

1021.04 --> 1026.6399999999999
so yeah i i'd love to see what he digs

1024.24 --> 1028.0
up about it you know

1026.64 --> 1031.5200000000002
one of the few

1028.0 --> 1033.12
areas where his tenacious his tenacity

1031.52 --> 1034.72
actually is kind of

1033.12 --> 1038.1989999999998
useful

1034.72 --> 1038.199
so yeah

1038.24 --> 1043.52
it probably will get a bit over the top

1041.12 --> 1046.6399999999999
just the excitement and the pressure

1043.52 --> 1049.6
is very high out there in general

1046.64 --> 1052.7990000000002
not just him or anything

1049.6 --> 1054.7199999999998
me too full moon yeah full moon coming

1052.799 --> 1056.67
no it was already there yesterday was a

1054.72 --> 1062.369
full moon

1056.67 --> 1062.3690000000001
[Music]

1065.44 --> 1069.6000000000001
think

1067.2 --> 1070.799
i mean i literally looked it up then

1069.6 --> 1073.23
and

1070.799 --> 1077.36
like moon calendar

1073.23 --> 1080.76
[Music]

1077.36 --> 1085.4399999999998
moon faces lunar calendar right it's now

1080.76 --> 1085.44
99.8 so it's just been full

1088.88 --> 1092.3600000000001
waning gibbous

1095.28 --> 1099.44
which is actually a sign of tension

1097.44 --> 1101.6000000000001
deflation and transformation that's

1099.44 --> 1103.039
usually the influence that has at least

1101.6 --> 1107.03
it does on me so

1103.039 --> 1109.2
kind of glad about that

1107.03 --> 1110.48
[Music]

1109.2 --> 1112.32
you could certainly

1110.48 --> 1114.48
feel it and maybe that is what it was

1112.32 --> 1116.48
yesterday was just so much tension and i

1114.48 --> 1119.679
stayed up all night it's it's just been

1116.48 --> 1124.16
too much i basically

1119.679 --> 1126.4
kind of overburden my spirit probably

1124.16 --> 1129.6000000000001
and did take a coffee also yes i don't

1126.4 --> 1129.6000000000001
know why i even did that

1132.559 --> 1137.84
i think that's probably the combination

1135.76 --> 1140.0
of it all

1137.84 --> 1141.84
yeah so when tensions are super high

1140.0 --> 1144.96
don't drink coffee especially if you're

1141.84 --> 1148.84
not super used to it

1144.96 --> 1148.8400000000001
don't recommend it

1158.96 --> 1163.679
a harvest moon

1160.8 --> 1166.24
[Music]

1163.679 --> 1168.24
i don't know

1166.24 --> 1170.0
what

1168.24 --> 1171.44
what makes a harvest moon is that just

1170.0 --> 1174.559
because it's in

1171.44 --> 1174.559
at the end of summer or

1175.44 --> 1181.039
i'm sorry i'm not super up to date with

1178.08 --> 1183.6789999999999
like every

1181.039 --> 1186.64
gnomer of the system concerning moon

1183.679 --> 1186.64
phases and all that

1187.28 --> 1192.48
i mean like up to a week few weeks ago i

1190.4 --> 1194.4
didn't even just recognize the word

1192.48 --> 1195.679
gibbous i was like what the [ __ ] is a

1194.4 --> 1196.64
gibbous

1195.679 --> 1198.96
this is

1196.64 --> 1198.96
right

1199.84 --> 1204.28
i'm all about just frameworks

1206.72 --> 1210.64
my

1207.84 --> 1213.039
memory compared it seems like

1210.64 --> 1217.039
i feel like i know a lot but my memory

1213.039 --> 1220.24
of just details is not super great

1217.039 --> 1222.48
it returns to me like in moments when

1220.24 --> 1224.48
it's like important

1222.48 --> 1228.28
it's almost like i'm using my memory

1224.48 --> 1228.28
sparingly or something

1238.799 --> 1242.6399999999999
which is a good thing because i'm like

1240.96 --> 1246.08
very eager

1242.64 --> 1248.96
in the moment to know things but

1246.08 --> 1250.799
that would over strain me and that is

1248.96 --> 1253.2
really part of the

1250.799 --> 1256.679
why i'm in the predicament of the way

1253.2 --> 1256.679
that i am

1262.32 --> 1266.8799999999999
it's been really my over eagerness

1264.48 --> 1268.72
impulses in life especially during my

1266.88 --> 1270.4
teens that have

1268.72 --> 1273.44
actually ended up

1270.4 --> 1275.5800000000002
making me disconnect more

1273.44 --> 1281.049
to do the opposite

1300.24 --> 1302.64
harvest moon

1301.6 --> 1306.559
how is it

1302.64 --> 1306.5590000000002
oh right right

1312.72 --> 1316.64
you know there

1315.36 --> 1318.7199999999998
there has been

1316.64 --> 1320.3200000000002
this weird little thing

1318.72 --> 1323.919
out there

1320.32 --> 1325.9189999999999
that i don't exactly know what it was

1323.919 --> 1327.6000000000001
it seemed like a planet and it's like

1325.919 --> 1329.8400000000001
been shining

1327.6 --> 1331.1999999999998
pretty much through my open door at

1329.84 --> 1334.9599999999998
night

1331.2 --> 1337.2
so they could just stare at it and

1334.96 --> 1339.3600000000001
it would be like very bright almost as

1337.2 --> 1341.8400000000001
bright as venus could be sometimes but

1339.36 --> 1343.9189999999999
it's like in the middle of the night

1341.84 --> 1347.799
it wasn't venus

1343.919 --> 1347.7990000000002
what planet was that

1349.919 --> 1354.4
i don't know if it's still

1352.32 --> 1357.28
like it's probably going to move down or

1354.4 --> 1357.2800000000002
in something but

1358.159 --> 1362.64
it's been there for quite a while like

1360.799 --> 1364.6399999999999
maybe a month or something

1362.64 --> 1367.2
that i could just see it through my door

1364.64 --> 1367.2
every night

1367.36 --> 1372.84
serious dogs what

1369.84 --> 1372.84
really

1374.88 --> 1379.1200000000001
wait isn't that like part of orion's

1376.96 --> 1382.159
belt

1379.12 --> 1382.1589999999999
because no

1383.919 --> 1387.8400000000001
it wasn't that

1385.76 --> 1390.559
it didn't seem like a star it was just

1387.84 --> 1392.8799999999999
really freaking bright like

1390.559 --> 1394.799
venus can be

1392.88 --> 1396.7990000000002
but it just didn't seem like it was

1394.799 --> 1399.799
venus but maybe it was i don't know

1396.799 --> 1399.799
exactly

1401.02 --> 1405.45
[Music]

1414.32 --> 1417.84
should get the app

1422.88 --> 1428.5200000000002
i'm getting really hungry by the way

1424.64 --> 1428.5200000000002
which is a good sign

1433.52 --> 1437.559
dog days of what

1471.039 --> 1477.76
but what but what is that then agm what

1475.2 --> 1477.76
is that

1478.0 --> 1483.039
so you're saying it wasn't actually a

1480.24 --> 1487.52
planet but actually a star that just for

1483.039 --> 1489.84
some reason lights up or is this some

1487.52 --> 1493.039
unknown planet

1489.84 --> 1493.039
like what is that then

1497.12 --> 1499.6789999999999
jupiter

1502.0 --> 1508.24
oh i haven't yet i've been kind of lazy

1504.88 --> 1510.7990000000002
i guess but i haven't even like

1508.24 --> 1512.96
tried to zoom in with my p900 although

1510.799 --> 1517.039
it's probably not gonna

1512.96 --> 1517.039
reveal too much even if i did that

1519.919 --> 1522.72
but okay

1521.279 --> 1525.72
if you say that that would have been

1522.72 --> 1525.72
jupiter

1530.88 --> 1535.2
super bright right now following the

1532.96 --> 1536.64
moon through the sky

1535.2 --> 1538.799
at night

1536.64 --> 1541.2
yeah it does follow it

1538.799 --> 1542.8799999999999
the moon's always more to my right which

1541.2 --> 1545.8400000000001
would be that way

1542.88 --> 1548.96
and then it is right there shining at me

1545.84 --> 1548.9599999999998
so that makes sense

1551.679 --> 1554.64
so that's jupiter

1554.96 --> 1558.72
why does it get so bright then

1560.24 --> 1563.679
i mean

1562.0 --> 1566.88
just think like

1563.679 --> 1568.88
if you're correct in this and it is

1566.88 --> 1572.5590000000002
jupiter as you say

1568.88 --> 1574.72
then why the hell does it get so bright

1572.559 --> 1577.6789999999999
that makes no sense it's supposed to be

1574.72 --> 1579.919
super far away in in the astronomy

1577.679 --> 1581.6000000000001
heliocentric model

1579.919 --> 1582.7990000000002
how is it then suddenly gonna get so

1581.6 --> 1586.48
bright

1582.799 --> 1586.48
that's just what

1590.799 --> 1595.22
okay agm we get it brad is starting this

1593.279 --> 1598.39
guy's serious yes

1595.22 --> 1598.39
[Music]

1602.39 --> 1608.16
[Music]

1616.08 --> 1620.24
but yeah unless sirius just suddenly

1619.12 --> 1622.799
lights up

1620.24 --> 1624.48
like a supernova

1622.799 --> 1626.6399999999999
then

1624.48 --> 1630.32
this was not it because i know how

1626.64 --> 1633.039
bright sirius is in like on orion's belt

1630.32 --> 1637.6399999999999
right that that's the one right

1633.039 --> 1637.64
or am i getting that wrong too i mean

1640.72 --> 1645.919
i know how bright that is compared to

1643.039 --> 1648.799
the other stars this was not that

1645.919 --> 1654.44
it's way way too bright like

1648.799 --> 1654.44
didn't see orion's belt around it either

1655.51 --> 1658.66
[Music]

1661.2 --> 1664.76
okay agm

1676.559 --> 1680.08
all right jupiter quite near yeah that

1678.159 --> 1683.3600000000001
makes sense then because yeah then it

1680.08 --> 1684.03
probably was jupiter

1683.36 --> 1686.799
right

1684.03 --> 1690.08
[Music]

1686.799 --> 1691.679
but now i'm inquiring to heliocentrism

1690.08 --> 1693.6789999999999
for a second

1691.679 --> 1697.799
and asking why

1693.679 --> 1697.799
why does it get so bright

1697.919 --> 1703.039
when most of the time it isn't so how

1700.399 --> 1707.84
does the moon

1703.039 --> 1707.84
that supposed object super close to us

1708.0 --> 1713.52
and the proxim proximity

1710.64 --> 1716.72
of jupiter to it

1713.52 --> 1720.799
visually angular wise how does that make

1716.72 --> 1720.799
jupiter suddenly light up so much

1723.6 --> 1728.039
how

1724.48 --> 1728.039
how does that happen

1732.72 --> 1738.949
[Music]

1742.72 --> 1747.84
anyway hello stevlon

1745.6 --> 1749.84
frankly

1747.84 --> 1752.72
we're all moving

1749.84 --> 1756.48
uh no earth is stationary

1752.72 --> 1756.48
only the celestials are moving

1759.36 --> 1766.1999999999998
less pollution what is this paraplegic

1763.2 --> 1766.2
what

1766.36 --> 1772.9189999999999
[Music]

1769.919 --> 1772.919
hey

1782.559 --> 1786.96
okay gortilla that is super informative

1785.2 --> 1789.1200000000001
thank you for that

1786.96 --> 1791.679
but

1789.12 --> 1794.2399999999998
why doesn't it constantly do that then

1791.679 --> 1796.72
the entire year around why does it get

1794.24 --> 1799.44
so bright when it gets closer angular

1796.72 --> 1802.08
wise to the moon and not the rest

1799.44 --> 1802.0800000000002
of the time

1802.559 --> 1807.6
how does

1804.32 --> 1809.4399999999998
its magnificent gas reflection ability

1807.6 --> 1812.559
in a vacuum of space

1809.44 --> 1815.52
allow it to get brighter

1812.559 --> 1817.76
a lot brighter when it get closer to

1815.52 --> 1820.6399999999999
angular wise to the moon because it

1817.76 --> 1822.32
isn't actually getting closer i mean the

1820.64 --> 1824.64
distance literal distance in the

1822.32 --> 1827.52
heliocentric model

1824.64 --> 1829.5200000000002
between the moon and jupiter

1827.52 --> 1832.1589999999999
is insignificant

1829.52 --> 1834.399
the amount it it differs so it's only

1832.159 --> 1836.88
angular difference but why does that

1834.399 --> 1838.36
then make jupiter brighter

1836.88 --> 1842.0
explain to me

1838.36 --> 1842.0
heliocentrist dammit

1849.2 --> 1852.799
that's dipping down enough cops

1855.67 --> 1860.24
[Music]

1858.24 --> 1863.24
shout out to bev

1860.24 --> 1863.24
okay

1866.64 --> 1871.7990000000002
fine

1868.159 --> 1871.7990000000002
that's what you like

1879.36 --> 1885.12
jupiter moves around

1881.44 --> 1885.1200000000001
yeah because it's a celestial light

1886.159 --> 1889.279
it's a

1887.12 --> 1892.08
a planet all

1889.279 --> 1895.039
formerly known before it became

1892.08 --> 1898.32
standardized in the vernacularis planet

1895.039 --> 1899.6
before that it was called a wandering

1898.32 --> 1902.32
star

1899.6 --> 1904.32
you know why

1902.32 --> 1905.2
because

1904.32 --> 1907.36
it

1905.2 --> 1909.919
is like a star

1907.36 --> 1912.24
that was just very well recognized

1909.919 --> 1915.76
but it moves in relation to the other

1912.24 --> 1919.519
star it's a non-fixed to the celestial

1915.76 --> 1922.1589999999999
apparent sphere star it moves

1919.519 --> 1922.159
separately

1922.64 --> 1927.279
a wandering star

1924.88 --> 1930.279
that's why it moves around

1927.279 --> 1930.279
right

1945.84 --> 1950.559
right and this is by the way also what i

1948.32 --> 1953.519
think of

1950.559 --> 1955.76
when for it looks beautiful occult maybe

1953.519 --> 1957.6
i can get rv some

1955.76 --> 1959.6
juicy little hints

1957.6 --> 1962.559
not he knows it though right i'll just

1959.6 --> 1963.84
be reminding him of it if he sees this

1962.559 --> 1966.0
but

1963.84 --> 1968.24
there's a reason

1966.0 --> 1971.279
why in hollywood

1968.24 --> 1973.679
they call them stars it's not because oh

1971.279 --> 1974.88
it's a twinkly thing

1973.679 --> 1976.3990000000001
no

1974.88 --> 1980.48
i think it's actually

1976.399 --> 1981.76
a reference to the wandering stars

1980.48 --> 1986.48
the planets

1981.76 --> 1986.48
oh planets you say oh so like

1987.36 --> 1991.1999999999998
the pantheon

1988.799 --> 1994.08
of the romans

1991.2 --> 1994.0800000000002
a little g's

1994.399 --> 1996.7199999999998
hmm

1996.799 --> 1999.039
right

1999.84 --> 2005.36
but yeah that's probably not news

2003.76 --> 2007.12
or maybe it was maybe you never thought

2005.36 --> 2009.1999999999998
of it that way that it's actually a

2007.12 --> 2012.4799999999998
direct reference to the planets and not

2009.2 --> 2012.48
the fixed stars

2012.799 --> 2015.12
anyway

2015.279 --> 2019.919
haven't been in there so well why are

2017.2 --> 2023.039
you so mad with us what

2019.919 --> 2023.039
mad with you no

2023.76 --> 2027.2
i was just in a really freaking bad mood

2026.0 --> 2029.36
that days

2027.2 --> 2033.3990000000001
see montreal and then

2029.36 --> 2033.399
bev just got in and

2034.399 --> 2037.36
and made it worse

2044.32 --> 2049.7599999999998
look

2047.2 --> 2053.2
i don't want to keep on explaining that

2049.76 --> 2056.0
i've already spent like several days

2053.2 --> 2057.52
trying to explain it how i see bev it's

2056.0 --> 2059.359
just like

2057.52 --> 2063.2
i don't really like it

2059.359 --> 2066.56
and i think he is just like it

2063.2 --> 2067.6789999999996
is really ridiculous little tricks

2066.56 --> 2070.72
it

2067.679 --> 2072.8
i really really don't like people that

2070.72 --> 2076.879
do that

2072.8 --> 2078.32
that is so upfront like

2076.879 --> 2081.359
being like that

2078.32 --> 2083.52
i really dislike that personally it's

2081.359 --> 2083.52
like

2083.76 --> 2086.0
but

2086.32 --> 2090.639
i mean it could be worse for now

2092.879 --> 2097.2799999999997
he does seem to have like a

2094.8 --> 2099.2000000000003
yeah a room thing going and people kind

2097.28 --> 2101.3590000000004
of like it there and it has a variety of

2099.2 --> 2103.7599999999998
people and that is like yeah

2101.359 --> 2107.2799999999997
i wouldn't want to be like how dare you

2103.76 --> 2109.44
uh no no keep going man i mean it just

2107.28 --> 2112.4
just

2109.44 --> 2115.359
don't expect that yours well what i

2112.4 --> 2118.2400000000002
would call special boy ideas are really

2115.359 --> 2120.72
gonna cut any wood

2118.24 --> 2120.72
it's not

2122.4 --> 2128.48
that's all

2124.88 --> 2130.96
right and i and there is just a

2128.48 --> 2133.599
the whole thing about that he like

2130.96 --> 2135.119
adamantly refuses to call to call

2133.599 --> 2137.76
himself a flat earther and that the

2135.119 --> 2138.8
earth is flat that is just childish to

2137.76 --> 2140.8
me

2138.8 --> 2143.599
and that's one of those typical problems

2140.8 --> 2145.599
so that that is it that's it

2143.599 --> 2148.32
oh oh and yeah of course denying the

2145.599 --> 2151.119
black swan which is just preposterous

2148.32 --> 2154.1600000000003
that's just stupid i can't say anything

2151.119 --> 2156.48
more about it than just that

2154.16 --> 2156.48
and

2156.56 --> 2159.2799999999997
fine

2157.44 --> 2161.44
maybe he needs some more time to figure

2159.28 --> 2164.88
it out maybe he needs to deal with his

2161.44 --> 2167.44
pride and his position within it

2164.88 --> 2170.0
even though he denies he has an ego

2167.44 --> 2173.839
god and then yeah and see

2170.0 --> 2173.839
now you're getting me going again

2177.359 --> 2181.839
but i hope you can feel off me at least

2179.68 --> 2183.5989999999997
that i'm not mad at him i'm just kind of

2181.839 --> 2186.599
annoyed

2183.599 --> 2186.599
and

2188.0 --> 2190.0
yeah

2188.88 --> 2192.32
that's it

2190.0 --> 2194.88
and then when i feel really like

2192.32 --> 2197.2000000000003
ready to lash out i'm very frustrated or

2194.88 --> 2200.6800000000003
something and then he gets in my face

2197.2 --> 2200.68
here and just

2202.4 --> 2206.7200000000003
base yeah it's hard to even describe

2204.88 --> 2208.079
what that is it's just like trying to

2206.72 --> 2210.9599999999996
dominate

2208.079 --> 2213.44
but showing that he's really calm

2210.96 --> 2214.64
versus me is obviously not really calm

2213.44 --> 2217.2000000000003
in that moment

2214.64 --> 2219.52
that's just really annoying this is like

2217.2 --> 2222.3199999999997
trying to turn my show into this

2219.52 --> 2224.0
personal politics thing and i don't want

2222.32 --> 2226.88
that i don't want to

2224.0 --> 2229.839
go up against beth

2226.88 --> 2229.839
it's annoying

2234.24 --> 2241.3199999999997
just do what you do and

2237.44 --> 2241.32
i'll do what i do

[Music]

2245.119 --> 2248.1600000000003
he does not deny the black swan he has

2247.04 --> 2250.96
some

2248.16 --> 2250.96
yeah no

2252.48 --> 2259.28
but that just makes no sense

2255.839 --> 2263.2799999999997
you have some issues with it that is

2259.28 --> 2266.079
like there is some maneuvering

2263.28 --> 2267.8390000000004
ability to the fundamental argument with

2266.079 --> 2270.0
this which is the black swan it's not

2267.839 --> 2272.0789999999997
the picture

2270.0 --> 2275.839
yeah the black swan argument is not

2272.079 --> 2278.88
about the oil rig picture or any picture

2275.839 --> 2282.24
it's an argument

2278.88 --> 2284.32
it's not like a scientific claim

2282.24 --> 2286.0
it's not a measurement even though

2284.32 --> 2287.599
measurements are involved through

2286.0 --> 2289.52
visuals through

2287.599 --> 2292.4
observations

2289.52 --> 2295.44
those are just the materials that are

2292.4 --> 2299.359
used to make the argument the argument

2295.44 --> 2301.359
is just very technical you can't have

2299.359 --> 2303.359
issues with that either you understand

2301.359 --> 2307.359
it or you don't

2303.359 --> 2307.359
there is no issues with it

2307.52 --> 2311.359
that's pointless

2309.52 --> 2313.599
that's already

2311.359 --> 2316.88
proving you don't get it

2313.599 --> 2316.88
that's all and

2317.04 --> 2322.24
i just don't want to deal with people

2319.04 --> 2325.62
that don't get that after freaking

2322.24 --> 2329.9089999999997
two years

that's fine

[Music]

2346.96 --> 2351.92
if he's a good host and he makes for an

2350.079 --> 2355.2000000000003
interesting platform for people to

2351.92 --> 2357.839
communicate on on a at least attempted

2355.2 --> 2360.0
higher level

2357.839 --> 2362.16
applaud and yeah he will be a lot more

2360.0 --> 2363.92
free it will not be an uh a flatter

2362.16 --> 2367.96
debate platform where

2363.92 --> 2367.96
literally you get like

2368.72 --> 2372.3199999999997
yeah what do you say it's like a

2369.839 --> 2374.0789999999997
military court style almost it's because

2372.32 --> 2375.599
it's like yeah this is just the highest

2374.079 --> 2377.04
level

2375.599 --> 2378.7200000000003
i mean

2377.04 --> 2380.96
it's even like a spoken out yeah if you

2378.72 --> 2383.52
just want to blabber it like

2380.96 --> 2386.48
sorry this is not the platform and even

2383.52 --> 2390.56
i with my pretty well developed ideas

2386.48 --> 2390.56
and heavy insights and all that

2390.64 --> 2396.7999999999997
have to make quite a an elbow effort

2393.28 --> 2399.599
sometimes to get my idea through without

2396.8 --> 2401.8390000000004
it just immediately being laughed at and

2399.599 --> 2404.1600000000003
shedded on

2401.839 --> 2406.4
for being irrelevant and not proven and

2404.16 --> 2408.3999999999996
not scientific and why are you telling

2406.4 --> 2411.44
us all this nonsense he does that to me

2408.4 --> 2413.44
just as well but that's because of what

2411.44 --> 2415.599
the platform is what it stands for what

2413.44 --> 2418.0
it's trying to achieve the highest

2415.599 --> 2419.52
standard not a community where people

2418.0 --> 2421.44
can't just like

2419.52 --> 2423.599
blabber and like oh we're gonna have a

2421.44 --> 2426.48
discussion no no no no that's not the

2423.599 --> 2426.48
flat earth debate

2430.72 --> 2435.2799999999997
i mean i guess the guys among one

2432.88 --> 2438.1600000000003
another can have that when nathan kind

2435.28 --> 2440.0
of is like okay just

2438.16 --> 2442.56
just talk about whatever you like and it

2440.0 --> 2445.92
goes in different directions and we we

2442.56 --> 2449.04
do have a bit of luxury but in general

2445.92 --> 2450.16
if you really want to go up against

2449.04 --> 2452.079
the main

2450.16 --> 2454.16
situation what's actually happening in

2452.079 --> 2458.0
the show and nathan

2454.16 --> 2459.92
challenge it's gonna be really heavy

2458.0 --> 2462.88
that's just the way it is it starts out

2459.92 --> 2462.88
really nice though

2462.96 --> 2467.92
but if you just get stubborn and sloppy

2465.2 --> 2469.9199999999996
and start to double think yeah you're

2467.92 --> 2473.839
gonna be screwed

2469.92 --> 2473.839
you're gonna see the ends of the pits

2474.079 --> 2479.599
anyway

2476.319 --> 2481.839
you should come over let's have a talk

2479.599 --> 2481.839
okay

2481.92 --> 2485.92
well maybe i will at some point

2487.04 --> 2490.079
but

2488.8 --> 2492.2400000000002
i don't know

2490.079 --> 2495.76
like yeah i'd have to like watch the

2492.24 --> 2498.64
show first i mean i might just not feel

2495.76 --> 2498.6400000000003
like doing that

2503.04 --> 2508.079
i mean if you want to think about

2505.52 --> 2510.64
a place where i really like to hang

2508.079 --> 2513.52
around and even be on the panel

2510.64 --> 2514.72
at this moment in this moment in time

2513.52 --> 2516.96
i hope it

2514.72 --> 2518.8799999999997
it gets better it doesn't go away

2516.96 --> 2521.839
because it is kind of magical to me ways

2518.88 --> 2523.76
but i really like jim bob stream and i

2521.839 --> 2525.359
like being part of them

2523.76 --> 2528.3190000000004
and i just get

2525.359 --> 2530.72
so much inspiration in the chat as well

2528.319 --> 2533.359
both religious as well as like

2530.72 --> 2535.839
mechanical and all that it's

2533.359 --> 2537.52
it's really been a blast for me and i

2535.839 --> 2540.48
know others have recognized i know

2537.52 --> 2542.319
nathan definitely feels that too he

2540.48 --> 2544.8
might not have the time to constantly

2542.319 --> 2546.64
follow him but nathan definitely

2544.8 --> 2548.4
understands

2546.64 --> 2551.839
jim bob is like

2548.4 --> 2551.839
doing something very special

2554.16 --> 2557.04
he's crushing it

2556.079 --> 2559.3590000000004
anyway

2557.04 --> 2559.359
yeah

2559.68 --> 2561.52
hey

2560.56 --> 2565.72
robert

2561.52 --> 2565.72
guns have never run good see you

2566.72 --> 2570.7999999999997
it's a cool cucumber okay

2573.09 --> 2581.28
[Music]

2579.599 --> 2583.3590000000004
right yeah the the thing about

2581.28 --> 2586.0
stubbornness is and this is me oh

2583.359 --> 2587.839
getting involved again oh are we

2586.0 --> 2588.64
trying to do it again

2587.839 --> 2591.359
yeah

2588.64 --> 2593.92
yeah i have a lot of stubbornness too

2591.359 --> 2594.88
a lot it used to be a lot worse you know

2593.92 --> 2596.96
why

2594.88 --> 2598.7200000000003
because it isn't anymore because i

2596.96 --> 2601.76
actually learned

2598.72 --> 2603.9199999999996
to utilize or tame

2601.76 --> 2605.119
although yeah how do you tame

2603.92 --> 2607.04
stubbornness that's almost

2605.119 --> 2609.6800000000003
self-contradicting but i basically

2607.04 --> 2609.68
learned to

2610.319 --> 2614.88
give it a

2612.4 --> 2617.119
a system

2614.88 --> 2618.839
to apply to

2617.119 --> 2621.76
very specific it's

2618.839 --> 2625.54
stubbornness like my rage include it's

2621.76 --> 2628.6400000000003
all part of a very specific system to me

2625.54 --> 2630.88
[Music]

2628.64 --> 2634.0789999999997
right because you should not always be

2630.88 --> 2637.359
stubborn and especially not about like

2634.079 --> 2637.3590000000004
because you wanna

2637.44 --> 2641.76
right you're gonna be stubborn has to

2639.04 --> 2641.7599999999998
have a point

2643.359 --> 2648.7999999999997
and i don't think that bev is like a

2646.079 --> 2653.04
real big star at that

2648.8 --> 2653.04
he might never become a star at that

2657.359 --> 2663.839

2659.92 --> 2663.839
thank you for the membership system

2669.119 --> 2674.88
post gymbops you don't know oh okay

2672.48 --> 2677.28
oh you've been messing up i mean the guy

2674.88 --> 2678.8
has been like having brenda on even and

2677.28 --> 2681.119
all that

2678.8 --> 2684.0
i mean the guy is a natural

2681.119 --> 2686.1600000000003
natural psychologist

2684.0 --> 2688.88
he's amazing

2686.16 --> 2690.96
so much patience it's unbelievable but

2688.88 --> 2692.96
not not infinite though

2690.96 --> 2695.119
he's not just like oh let it all happen

2692.96 --> 2696.56
no no but just

2695.119 --> 2699.28
a lot

2696.56 --> 2700.319

2699.28 --> 2702.48
grip

2700.319 --> 2705.359
on a whole bunch of subjects it's like

2702.48 --> 2706.4
really interesting but yeah here's his

2705.359 --> 2708.96
channel

2706.4 --> 2708.96

2725.119 --> 2727.839
what

2726.079 --> 2730.96
i don't have to prove anything to anyone

2727.839 --> 2730.96
my intelligence proceeds

2731.839 --> 2737.92
thank you

2733.119 --> 2737.92
i am feel very honored to hear that

2741.76 --> 2745.2400000000002
but i yeah

2747.28 --> 2752.8
i very sparingly like to call myself

2749.52 --> 2755.359
smart because maybe yeah it's just a

2752.8 --> 2757.04
pattern an aberration i think

2755.359 --> 2759.44
in there

2757.04 --> 2761.2799999999997
that's the smarter you are

2759.44 --> 2763.52
if it's real

2761.28 --> 2767.2000000000003
if you're actually getting smarter if

2763.52 --> 2767.2
you're actually you're gonna see

2769.92 --> 2776.079
how many mistakes you actually make

2774.0 --> 2778.88
smarter you become the more you realize

2776.079 --> 2780.2400000000002
how stupid you can actually be

2778.88 --> 2782.6400000000003
right

2780.24 --> 2785.7599999999998
if you're actually smarter and not just

2782.64 --> 2787.7599999999998
like oh know how to really seem smart

2785.76 --> 2790.2400000000002
and then you're not because you've been

2787.76 --> 2792.38
then you're not burdened by that see

2790.24 --> 2798.4799999999996
because actually being smart is a burden

2792.38 --> 2799.92
[Music]

2798.48 --> 2803.839
but yeah i

2799.92 --> 2803.839
i am smart i know

2808.72 --> 2814.72
i've really done a lot of effort in my

2811.599 --> 2817.04
life to like religiously carry the

2814.72 --> 2819.4399999999996
weight of that

2817.04 --> 2819.44
it is

2819.68 --> 2822.7999999999997
kind of torturous

2825.119 --> 2830.76
but

2826.0 --> 2830.76
i'd like to say it's worth it

2831.359 --> 2835.2
but then again i can't imagine what

2833.52 --> 2839.359
would have happened if i hadn't done

2835.2 --> 2839.359
that if i'd actually laid it down

2839.52 --> 2845.72
and i don't even know if i could have

2842.56 --> 2845.72
i mean

2846.88 --> 2851.44
i've spent quite a few

2849.04 --> 2853.52
years like in my youth

2851.44 --> 2855.359
early teens late

2853.52 --> 2858.4
pre-teens

2855.359 --> 2861.68
like pretending like i was a normal

2858.4 --> 2863.04
person and not smart i was like

2861.68 --> 2864.56
scared

2863.04 --> 2866.079
of my smarts

2864.56 --> 2869.92
you know why

2866.079 --> 2872.0
because if people found out

2869.92 --> 2875.28
then they would get jealous and start to

2872.0 --> 2877.599
make fun of me or start to lie about me

2875.28 --> 2877.599
kids

2880.72 --> 2883.72
so

2886.64 --> 2891.2
i mean actually being smart and proving

2889.44 --> 2892.96
that

2891.2 --> 2895.1189999999997
doing that and then other people can

2892.96 --> 2896.319
tune in and feel that it can actually

2895.119 --> 2898.319
hurt

2896.319 --> 2900.88
it can hurt

2898.319 --> 2903.2799999999997
to feel oh [ __ ] that person is smarter

2900.88 --> 2905.04
than me oh no

2903.28 --> 2906.559
ouch

2905.04 --> 2909.2
and hey

2906.559 --> 2912.48
lucky to say i am not literally the

2909.2 --> 2914.48
smartest person in the world

2912.48 --> 2916.48
no it's not it's not even about that

2914.48 --> 2918.2400000000002
it's just about

2916.48 --> 2920.0
the quality of the knowledge that you

2918.24 --> 2921.2
have available to you

2920.0 --> 2923.04
what type

2921.2 --> 2925.7599999999998
how far have you dug in how much have

2923.04 --> 2927.2
you specialized how much can you adapt

2925.76 --> 2930.0
your skill

2927.2 --> 2932.48
to other people's peak skill

2930.0 --> 2933.76
how much is it adaptable integratable

2932.48 --> 2934.88
with others

2933.76 --> 2936.559
that's

2934.88 --> 2939.6800000000003
and there's people out there that are

2936.559 --> 2942.559
just amazing in what they do

2939.68 --> 2944.64
and what they know and i can feel it

2942.559 --> 2947.599
like one of these people and

2944.64 --> 2949.44
his own benjamin

2947.599 --> 2951.52
he is

2949.44 --> 2954.0
smart and i know it because i can feel

2951.52 --> 2957.2
the burden on him from it

2954.0 --> 2958.48
he is a giant spiritually as well as

2957.2 --> 2961.2
literally

2958.48 --> 2961.2
but also

2961.52 --> 2965.2
jimbo is really smart

2964.16 --> 2968.0789999999997
and

2965.2 --> 2969.839
christopher gardner

2968.079 --> 2972.4
christopher gardner scares me a little

2969.839 --> 2972.4
sometimes

2973.2 --> 2977.359
i can feel so much spiritual metadata

2975.76 --> 2981.44
with that guy

2977.359 --> 2982.319
and he is like really carrying something

2981.44 --> 2984.079
like

2982.319 --> 2986.319
there's people out there that carry

2984.079 --> 2988.559
spiritual weights

2986.319 --> 2991.359
that when i can just feel that out from

2988.559 --> 2992.6400000000003
them it literally scares me it makes me

2991.359 --> 2994.4
like

2992.64 --> 2995.92
jesus

2994.4 --> 2996.96
really

2995.92 --> 3000.7200000000003
oh wow

2996.96 --> 3003.52
that's that's heavy

3000.72 --> 3006.7999999999997
and i think i like to think that i do

3003.52 --> 3008.88
carry a couple of weights myself

3006.8 --> 3010.48
but then there's always other people out

3008.88 --> 3011.2000000000003
there and they can just feel it off them

3010.48 --> 3012.8
like

3011.2 --> 3015.2
jesus

3012.8 --> 3016.319
you're like

3015.2 --> 3018.5589999999997
really

3016.319 --> 3021.68
carrying heavy things and making

3018.559 --> 3022.15
something with it too it's just woof

3021.68 --> 3023.5989999999997
so

3022.15 --> 3025.359
[Music]

3023.599 --> 3029.0
right anyway i don't even know what i'm

3025.359 --> 3029.0
talking about now

3041.28 --> 3043.92
that's cute

3045.92 --> 3051.52
yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh by the

3049.2 --> 3054.9199999999996
way all those people i mentioned they're

3051.52 --> 3054.92
all flat earthers

3066.0 --> 3069.52
i don't know any globers that really

3068.16 --> 3070.7999999999997
have a

3069.52 --> 3072.72
meaningful

3070.8 --> 3075.8390000000004
spark of insight

3072.72 --> 3075.839
that is compatible

3077.28 --> 3081.2000000000003
they've just rerouted their knowledge

3079.359 --> 3084.7999999999997
and their spirit to keep the ball

3081.2 --> 3084.7999999999997
juggling going right

3086.64 --> 3091.92
it's just entertaining the masses

3089.2 --> 3096.2
that aren't catching on

3091.92 --> 3096.2000000000003
who just kind of want to see that

3097.25 --> 3100.429

3107.2 --> 3111.2799999999997
yeah my crib in english is

3109.359 --> 3112.319
well i love hearing that

3111.28 --> 3113.599
robert

3112.319 --> 3116.4
thank you

3113.599 --> 3117.839
i mean that does make me feel like he

3116.4 --> 3120.1600000000003
awesome

3117.839 --> 3121.52
because i really wanted to become like a

3120.16 --> 3125.24
master at it

3121.52 --> 3125.24
at a very young age

3126.079 --> 3132.48
all i had to settle for is

3129.28 --> 3134.4
your entire life no matter how much you

3132.48 --> 3136.72
think you know you're always going to be

3134.4 --> 3141.48
learning new things about english

3136.72 --> 3141.48
always just every single time

3162.559 --> 3168.7200000000003
hash this out oh god no i wouldn't

3166.079 --> 3170.96
yeah but i don't want to get on there to

3168.72 --> 3175.2
to talk about

3170.96 --> 3175.2
what's wrong with the next one and

3175.839 --> 3180.2
no i don't want to do that

3180.72 --> 3187.68
he's just gonna blab around then

3183.599 --> 3187.6800000000003
until i get sick of it again no

3188.0 --> 3191.24
but then

3200.079 --> 3207.809
okay

3201.39 --> 3207.8089999999997
[Music]

3209.04 --> 3216.469
ugh

3210.47 --> 3216.4689999999996
[Music]

3227.04 --> 3232.16
no that's not true terra 306 i mean

3229.599 --> 3235.2000000000003
akuma virus has not learned much about

3232.16 --> 3237.92
actual flat earth mechanics

3235.2 --> 3239.9199999999996
or it's not readily available to him i

3237.92 --> 3242.16
mean he has the knowledge he can't

3239.92 --> 3243.92
really use it until he's like forced

3242.16 --> 3245.44
into some kind of defensive stance and

3243.92 --> 3247.359
then he might

3245.44 --> 3249.28
be able to recite it perfectly all of a

3247.359 --> 3252.72
sudden but in general he does not have

3249.28 --> 3252.7200000000003
that knowledge available to him

3253.119 --> 3258.8
but i'm pretty sure that the kumu virus

3255.2 --> 3263.5589999999997
does definitely study people

3258.8 --> 3263.559
and like social behavior and language

3274.96 --> 3277.96
uh

3279.599 --> 3282.599
uh

3285.59 --> 3295.359
[Music]

3293.44 --> 3296.4
i know you do akuma fires you've you've

3295.359 --> 3298.64
said that

3296.4 --> 3302.119
so that that to me is just simply what

3298.64 --> 3302.1189999999997
you're doing really

3302.24 --> 3305.29
[Music]

3308.16 --> 3311.92
and one thing i do know about you

3309.839 --> 3316.119
akumavirus is that you know how to

3311.92 --> 3316.119
recognize interesting people

3323.119 --> 3327.119
and i think you probably got a bit of an

3324.88 --> 3328.6400000000003
eye of inner potential too

3327.119 --> 3330.7400000000002
yeah but anyway

3328.64 --> 3332.4
uh

3330.74 --> 3334.24
[Music]

3332.4 --> 3337.839
can it miss his mistakes he's here to

3334.24 --> 3339.359
learn yes just not about those mistakes

3337.839 --> 3343.5589999999997
not about

3339.359 --> 3343.5589999999997
why the earth isn't a bald turret

3349.28 --> 3352.7200000000003
i like being wrong

3353.599 --> 3356.7200000000003
oh god

3356.799 --> 3360.52
ain't that the truth

3373.68 --> 3377.5989999999997
learn more when you're wrong yeah but

3375.359 --> 3379.5989999999997
only if you can actually correct the

3377.599 --> 3382.559
mistake though

3379.599 --> 3384.88
otherwise you're just being an idiot

3382.559 --> 3386.88
i mean that's the definition of doing

3384.88 --> 3388.6400000000003
something over and over again expecting

3386.88 --> 3389.6800000000003
different results

3388.64 --> 3392.799
and all

3389.68 --> 3393.9199999999996
classic definition

3392.799 --> 3396.92
so

3393.92 --> 3396.92
anyways

3397.91 --> 3401.19
[Music]

3413.44 --> 3417.88
yes there it i remember that

3427.119 --> 3430.2400000000002
i

3428.0 --> 3431.92
to be fair though like of all the

3430.24 --> 3434.319
anti-flat earthers that have come on

3431.92 --> 3438.4
flat earth debate i do really appreciate

3434.319 --> 3441.2799999999997
akumavirus for some of his comedical

3438.4 --> 3444.4
haphazard

3441.28 --> 3446.4
answers to to try to bypass some

3444.4 --> 3447.6800000000003
impossible to solve problems for the

3446.4 --> 3449.92
globe

3447.68 --> 3451.7599999999998
like

3449.92 --> 3454.64
how you can have a straight line of

3451.76 --> 3456.88
sight yet light being bent that was

3454.64 --> 3459.7599999999998
beautiful man

3456.88 --> 3462.319
ridiculous but be it's beautiful because

3459.76 --> 3464.96
it's just so freaking funny to me that

3462.319 --> 3467.68
was so funny i well i repeated it a

3464.96 --> 3470.2400000000002
couple of times at the time but

3467.68 --> 3475.0
it's that is just really funny

3470.24 --> 3475.0
stupid but funny as [ __ ]

3482.24 --> 3485.4799999999996
hey dank

3496.0 --> 3502.119
if this is misunderstood no yeah yeah

3498.48 --> 3502.119
missing by yourself

3502.16 --> 3504.48
yeah

3505.119 --> 3509.28
because it's literally contradictory but

3509.52 --> 3514.24
you're using two different ways to

3512.0 --> 3517.68
describe the same thing

3514.24 --> 3520.0789999999997
and then make them contradict themselves

3517.68 --> 3522.8799999999997
it is ridiculous

3520.079 --> 3525.6800000000003
it's not because we don't understand or

3522.88 --> 3529.88
it's just because that is

3525.68 --> 3529.8799999999997
logically incompatible

3530.4 --> 3536.7200000000003
it is a former double speed very much so

3533.28 --> 3536.7200000000003
but a very funny one

3543.44 --> 3548.7200000000003
the pants

3546.0 --> 3548.72
oh god

3548.799 --> 3555.319
no i was not too big a fan of akuma

3551.04 --> 3555.319
viruses coriolis defense

3578.0 --> 3581.76
right i haven't even addressed the title

3579.68 --> 3586.5989999999997
of the show yet

3581.76 --> 3586.599
right beam field particle wave

3591.76 --> 3594.0
so

3594.319 --> 3597.839
i hope you all understood that these are

3596.48 --> 3601.079
like

3597.839 --> 3601.0789999999997
the forms

3601.28 --> 3605.119
the forms of existence

3606.319 --> 3609.599
material wise at least

3609.68 --> 3615.319
i just thought like hey yeah why not sum

3611.44 --> 3615.319
it up in just one title

3622.4 --> 3626.96
right it is by the way extremely

3624.4 --> 3630.559
important to keep all of those

3626.96 --> 3630.559
factors separated

3631.44 --> 3635.2000000000003
right because none of those

3634.24 --> 3638.24
types

3635.2 --> 3639.7599999999998
those none of those forms are compatible

3638.24 --> 3643.319
they're all

3639.76 --> 3643.3190000000004
mutually exclusive

3644.16 --> 3649.68
but i've already heard among ethereans

3647.52 --> 3651.92
with it others

3649.68 --> 3654.72
where they just kind of like

3651.92 --> 3655.839
it just starts to mix up it and it's

3654.72 --> 3658.52
already

3655.839 --> 3661.839
like common vernacular to mix it up like

3658.52 --> 3662.88
electromagnetic wave

3661.839 --> 3665.52
all that

3662.88 --> 3667.599
that that form of description it's all

3665.52 --> 3671.2
so wrong

3667.599 --> 3673.6800000000003
it's complete cluster [ __ ] of mixing

3671.2 --> 3676.16
of what it actually is like

3673.68 --> 3677.839
it's yeah

3676.16 --> 3679.92
so i'm going to be kind of nitpicky

3677.839 --> 3682.0789999999997
about that i i've already attempted to

3679.92 --> 3684.16
do that

3682.079 --> 3686.88
about like yeah if somebody's gonna call

3684.16 --> 3689.44
an electromagnetic wave then say like oh

3686.88 --> 3691.52
really how is it a wave

3689.44 --> 3695.04
i'm pretty sure that everything electric

3691.52 --> 3695.04
or magnetic is a field

3695.2 --> 3698.799
like that's

3696.88 --> 3700.4
how it is

3698.799 --> 3702.64
fields

3700.4 --> 3702.64
right

3703.359 --> 3706.0
not a wave

3706.24 --> 3713.1189999999997
like a light obviously being a beam

3710.319 --> 3714.079
instantaneous vector the only

3713.119 --> 3716.96
one

3714.079 --> 3718.48
of the four that is instantaneous

3716.96 --> 3720.799
although yeah field is also

3718.48 --> 3725.799
instantaneous but it doesn't travel it's

3720.799 --> 3725.799
just it's sitting there it has a range

3726.4 --> 3732.1600000000003
so maybe in that sense beam and field do

3729.28 --> 3735.1600000000003
kind of share

3732.16 --> 3735.16
instantaneousness

3736.88 --> 3740.559
but they're definitely not the same

3738.559 --> 3742.88
things

3740.559 --> 3742.88
anyway

3744.96 --> 3749.76
would a crystal be a field of particles

3751.76 --> 3755.5200000000004
no

3752.799 --> 3756.88
no a crystal

3755.52 --> 3757.83

it's stacked it's

3766.079 --> 3771.3590000000004
it's stacked

3768.16 --> 3771.359
material stacks

3774.16 --> 3780.7599999999998
in crystalline fashion by the way

3777.2 --> 3780.7599999999998
it's not a field

3786.799 --> 3790.319
how fuels work

3792.24 --> 3797.2799999999997
matrix or lattice right yeah

3794.88 --> 3798.6400000000003
yeah that's a good yeah indeed adam you

3797.28 --> 3802.599
can

3798.64 --> 3802.5989999999997
hello by the way to the chat

3806.67 --> 3810.59
[Music]

3815.599 --> 3822.839
right but i believe as a

3818.72 --> 3826.3999999999996
simple very simplistic educational

3822.839 --> 3829.2
training that if you just take the title

3826.4 --> 3832.48
beam field particle wave and categorize

3829.2 --> 3834.16
this make a box put it in there

3832.48 --> 3835.52
and then reflect

3834.16 --> 3837.5989999999997
everything

3835.52 --> 3838.96
that relates to the physical natural

3837.599 --> 3840.7200000000003
world

3838.96 --> 3843.839
to it

3840.72 --> 3845.52
all the things that are in there

3843.839 --> 3850.0
and make sure you get it right i think

3845.52 --> 3852.64
that if you train just trying to do that

3850.0 --> 3856.24
you could like have a real

3852.64 --> 3857.7599999999998
improvement ability upon communication

3856.24 --> 3859.0389999999998
about physics

3857.76 --> 3861.119
because

3859.039 --> 3863.76
physics talk has become highly

3861.119 --> 3866.4
convoluted with mix-ups

3863.76 --> 3869.28
of the four forms

3866.4 --> 3870.48
highly mixed up i mean light is riddled

3869.28 --> 3872.7200000000003
with

3870.48 --> 3873.839
waves and when it is in a wave it's a

3872.72 --> 3874.799
beam

3873.839 --> 3876.799
right

3874.799 --> 3879.119
and then electro

3876.799 --> 3880.799
wave the wave is really like the biggest

3879.119 --> 3883.599
problem everything is

3880.799 --> 3885.0389999999998
becoming a wave

3883.599 --> 3888.799
in the vernacular

3885.039 --> 3888.7990000000004
it's mostly where things go towards

3890.64 --> 3894.0389999999998
but it isn't

3896.559 --> 3900.0
right

3897.599 --> 3902.6400000000003
technically

3900.0 --> 3902.64
a wave

3906.319 --> 3910.72
it's like really difficult to even be

3908.48 --> 3913.599
precise as to what that is because it's

3910.72 --> 3917.0389999999998
usually a secondary right and that

3913.599 --> 3918.559
almost makes it not part of the list

3917.039 --> 3920.7200000000003
because it is

3918.559 --> 3924.1600000000003
something that requires something else

3920.72 --> 3924.16
in order to have that happen

3924.799 --> 3930.319
well the other three are not

3927.599 --> 3933.96
secondary they're all primary

3930.319 --> 3933.96
beam field particle

3937.119 --> 3941.359
describe this way yeah but being

3939.44 --> 3943.68
described as waves doesn't mean it's a

3941.359 --> 3943.68
wave

3946.319 --> 3949.68
i mean i think i could

3947.92 --> 3952.319
like the

3949.68 --> 3954.72
the diffraction pattern of light i could

3952.319 --> 3956.5589999999997
definitely describe that

3954.72 --> 3958.72
as like

3956.559 --> 3960.6400000000003
unicorn

3958.72 --> 3962.64
footprints

3960.64 --> 3966.48
it's just like you shine light and then

3962.64 --> 3970.96
you get to see where the unicorn steps

3966.48 --> 3972.16
right that's why it's such a even out

3970.96 --> 3975.44
thing

3972.16 --> 3977.92
it's unicorn steps it's not a wave it's

3975.44 --> 3979.599
just unicorn walk everywhere and then

3977.92 --> 3981.839
when you shine light then suddenly you

3979.599 --> 3983.039
get to see where it steps and where it

3981.839 --> 3984.799
didn't step

3983.039 --> 3985.92
right and then depending on what type of

3984.799 --> 3987.599
light

3985.92 --> 3989.6800000000003
yeah they might even have this weird

3987.599 --> 3992.1600000000003
interventional effect where

3989.68 --> 3993.44
the steps suddenly become bigger or

3992.16 --> 3995.92
smaller

3993.44 --> 3999.28
right so yeah i can describe light

3995.92 --> 4001.52
diffraction patterns as unicorn steps as

3999.28 --> 4001.52
well

4002.4 --> 4007.64
and ironically enough that would be less

4004.64 --> 4007.64
confusing

4008.799 --> 4013.48
isn't that just

4010.48 --> 4013.48
hysterical

4031.03 --> 4034.2090000000003
[Music]

4038.4 --> 4041.92
yeah

4039.52 --> 4041.92
i'm gonna

4043.92 --> 4048.7200000000003
make the wave

4046.16 --> 4051.7599999999998
in a title with it with this

4048.72 --> 4054.64
small w implant instead of a capital

4051.76 --> 4057.88
letter to emphasize that it is the odd

4054.64 --> 4057.8799999999997
one out

4064.559 --> 4067.559
what

4084.24 --> 4088.52
what what are you talking about

4094.559 --> 4099.12
what did he say that was so incredibly

4096.48 --> 4101.839
irritating i mean besides just

4099.12 --> 4101.839
blabbering

4102.719 --> 4106.64
i mean jared like

4104.88 --> 4110.4400000000005
just

4106.64 --> 4110.4400000000005
take it easy a bit

4125.679 --> 4129.52
right

4127.04 --> 4131.359
so yeah

4129.52 --> 4134.4800000000005
he's not defending

4131.359 --> 4138.1990000000005
government bs stories like you say

4134.48 --> 4138.199
it's not doing that

4145.74 --> 4148.929999999999
[Music]

4151.359 --> 4156.319
you have to you do you really have to

4154.0 --> 4157.92
are you that compelled to do all that

4156.319 --> 4160.719
territ

4157.92 --> 4161.679
you know he's already heard such stories

4160.719 --> 4162.88
like

4161.679 --> 4165.759
at least

4162.88 --> 4167.679
a hundred times or so why would you be

4165.759 --> 4169.679
compelled to do that

4167.679 --> 4173.159
why would you be compelled to explain

4169.679 --> 4173.159
all that to him

4192.159 --> 4195.759999999999
i mean if you just want to share the

4193.6 --> 4197.84
story yeah sure but that's you wanting

4195.76 --> 4198.88
to share that story because

4197.84 --> 4201.28
you know

4198.88 --> 4204.2390000000005
akumuvar has already heard all of that

4201.28 --> 4204.239
hundreds of times

4206.32 --> 4212.0
yes yeah and that's his choice

4208.719 --> 4213.04
he chooses to ignore it and be blissful

4212.0 --> 4216.32
over it

4213.04 --> 4218.64
and that annoys you i get it you don't

4216.32 --> 4223.28
have to respect him for it but it's just

4218.64 --> 4227.0
there's no point in complaining about it

4223.28 --> 4227.0
just ignore him

4233.9 --> 4236.879999999999
[Music]

4235.04 --> 4239.679
i mean all he's gonna get is just gonna

4236.88 --> 4242.0
get on your nerves and then you're just

4239.679 --> 4244.32
gonna feed him

4242.0 --> 4247.52
would you really want to do that you

4244.32 --> 4250.719
want to feed a kumu virus

4247.52 --> 4250.719
with your agitation

4252.19 --> 4255.91
[Music]

4256.56 --> 4260.8
it's a troll yeah well his troll

4258.0 --> 4263.12
methodology is currently just letting

4260.8 --> 4264.320000000001
you be angry while he is relatively

4263.12 --> 4266.8
polite

4264.32 --> 4268.799999999999
and well behaved

4266.8 --> 4271.28
yeah he's not

4268.8 --> 4273.6
shutting up

4271.28 --> 4278.0
but that's his strategy right now

4273.6 --> 4278.0
because he isn't doing anything out like

4278.4 --> 4286.5599999999995
really offensive

4281.12 --> 4289.12
besides just his in but that's his life

4286.56 --> 4291.52
he wants to be stupid in plain sight

4289.12 --> 4294.5599999999995
that's his prerogative i mean you just

4291.52 --> 4296.320000000001
have to trust god

4294.56 --> 4299.120000000001
that things will be resolved the way

4296.32 --> 4300.639999999999
there they should be

4299.12 --> 4303.84
and that might not

4300.64 --> 4306.2390000000005
compare with what you want in this very

4303.84 --> 4306.2390000000005
moment

4309.84 --> 4314.1990000000005
he knows he can't get banned

4315.04 --> 4320.64
he can get banned i have banned him

4317.84 --> 4320.64
plenty of times

4322.719 --> 4327.36
by being polite he trolls no now now

4325.04 --> 4329.5199999999995
you're double speaking

4327.36 --> 4333.679
now by being polite

4329.52 --> 4335.52
he is actually complying to the rules

4333.679 --> 4338.719
of the chat

4335.52 --> 4338.719
and i appreciate that

4338.8 --> 4345.12
if i notice that he's like literally

4340.96 --> 4346.719
trying to get on my nerves on purpose

4345.12 --> 4349.599999999999
or if he's like

4346.719 --> 4351.6
trying to wind somebody else up

4349.6 --> 4352.8
on purpose and i don't think he is doing

4351.6 --> 4357.04
that i think that you're winding

4352.8 --> 4359.04
yourself up a bit here at terra 306

4357.04 --> 4362.6
just

4359.04 --> 4362.6
just let him

4370.23 --> 4378.799999999999
[Music]

4376.64 --> 4381.12

4381.12 --> 4385.28
virus

4383.199 --> 4387.5199999999995
bring up another subject

4385.28 --> 4389.44
just leave him to the side

4387.52 --> 4392.4400000000005
you don't have to read everything he

4389.44 --> 4392.44
writes

4410.4 --> 4413.4
this

4421.199 --> 4424.4
yeah guns have never yeah

4424.719 --> 4429.52
pretty to tell yeah but look that's not

4427.44 --> 4432.639999999999
really an argument though because it is

4429.52 --> 4434.4800000000005
all based on the model of how they

4432.64 --> 4436.64
engineered this

4434.48 --> 4439.04
futurist stuff

4436.64 --> 4442.0
the science fiction stuff right

4439.04 --> 4444.32
so yeah a jet engine

4442.0 --> 4446.96
doesn't have to travel insane amounts of

4444.32 --> 4446.96
distances

4447.28 --> 4449.599999999999
and

4451.52 --> 4454.88
yeah

4452.719 --> 4457.76
these rocket shuttles and all that

4454.88 --> 4459.84
they're much bulkier

4457.76 --> 4462.08
they have weight which wouldn't be a

4459.84 --> 4464.08
problem in space because there's no

4462.08 --> 4465.44
friction from the air

4464.08 --> 4467.679
[Music]

4465.44 --> 4469.759999999999
right

4467.679 --> 4472.8
so they can just build up a lot more

4469.76 --> 4476.4800000000005
speed in space

4472.8 --> 4476.4800000000005
even though it's extremely luggage

4479.44 --> 4484.96
and then after it's gone too spice they

4482.32 --> 4486.88
can just claim oh yeah it's at this

4484.96 --> 4489.28
just going faster and faster and faster

4486.88 --> 4491.84
and to like goes

4489.28 --> 4494.159
a million miles per hour or something

4491.84 --> 4497.04
they could think

4494.159 --> 4501.48
yeah they could say whatever they want

4497.04 --> 4501.48
once they reach the fictional medium

4510.96 --> 4515.5
but yeah thank you for the fact sharing

4514.159 --> 4521.869
that's interesting

4515.5 --> 4521.869
[Music]

4522.719 --> 4526.64
but yeah you have to realize that in the

4524.88 --> 4529.6
science fiction cosmology of

4526.64 --> 4531.84
heliocentrism outer space is a very

4529.6 --> 4534.400000000001
different type of environment as in the

4531.84 --> 4535.52
atmosphere

4534.4 --> 4537.759999999999
so

4535.52 --> 4539.76
yeah

4537.76 --> 4541.84
i mean from a ballwin perspective those

4539.76 --> 4543.4400000000005
numbers like yeah

4541.84 --> 4547.88
that makes perfect sense like oh yeah

yeah yeah that checks out

super great or anything

5000.48 --> 5002.959999999999
it's just a bit like

but

5002.96 --> 5007.84
it seemed to have passed i feel a lot

5004.48 --> 5010.049999999999

5052.719 --> 5054.96
just

5055.28 --> 5060.639
i think it bailed because

5057.679 --> 5062.56
because of akuma virus

5060.639 --> 5065.4400000000005
i guess akuma virus just really

5062.56 --> 5065.4400000000005
irritates him

5069.679 --> 5074.96
a lot in the past as well but

5072.48 --> 5078.5199999999995
i think that right now he's he's being

5092.639 --> 5098.08
turret is also in india

5095.52 --> 5101.1990000000005
so for him it's much later now it's

5098.08 --> 5101.199
basically night

that's illogical

5319.52 --> 5322.52
robert

5323.36 --> 5327.599999999999
akuma would have to be doing something

5328.8 --> 5332.639
you don't just act like a fool

like

5334.0 --> 5338.96
why would somebody pay somebody else to

5336.639 --> 5341.84
just act like a fool i mean acting like

5338.96 --> 5344.0
a fool is a cover act

5341.84 --> 5345.360000000001
for something

5344.0 --> 5347.28
but what

5345.36 --> 5350.32
i don't think kumu's getting paid to do

5347.28 --> 5354.5199999999995

5407.12 --> 5409.76
promise you

5412.639 --> 5415.84
that kumo no

5419.6 --> 5424.159000000001
right because why would somebody pay him

5421.6 --> 5426.4800000000005
to do that what would they gain

5424.159 --> 5428.239
from that investment

5426.48 --> 5430.638999999999
nothing

5428.239 --> 5432.718999999999
kumu's gonna do it anyway

5430.639 --> 5435.84
right just let it

5432.719 --> 5435.84
let it be

5436.48 --> 5439.839999999999
that just let people do what they do

5438.639 --> 5442.08
when

5439.84 --> 5443.679
yeah if they really need something done

5442.08 --> 5446.84
now that's when they

5443.679 --> 5450.159
start to forge a plan get

5446.84 --> 5450.96
together do things wrong and then like

5450.159 --> 5452.719
oh

5450.96 --> 5454.719
yeah sure we're trying to figure out

5452.719 --> 5459.2390000000005
what went wrong

5454.719 --> 5459.2390000000005
wow everything's going to the [ __ ]

5469.52 --> 5475.120000000001

5472.56 --> 5476.56

5475.12 --> 5479.679
psychopaths

5476.56 --> 5482.719
don't project that onto just

5479.679 --> 5485.28
people you bump into on the internet

5482.719 --> 5488.53

5510.8 --> 5515.4400000000005
yeah well kumu virus i think that at

5512.719 --> 5518.159
this point biden is just living a cue

5515.44 --> 5520.159
card life i don't think he has any grip

5518.159 --> 5522.4
on what the [ __ ] going on anymore but

5520.159 --> 5524.879999999999
with every anything

5522.4 --> 5525.92
i mean he can barely even keep track of

5524.88 --> 5528.400000000001
like the

5525.92 --> 5530.88
double speak lingo anymore

5528.4 --> 5530.879999999999
he's just

5531.12 --> 5536.719
i think he's just completely demented

5534.88 --> 5538.719
at this point

5536.719 --> 5540.88
although i guarantee you he was pretty

5538.719 --> 5542.96
freaking evil

5540.88 --> 5544.56
and that's still like caught in there it

5542.96 --> 5549.2390000000005
just

5544.56 --> 5549.2390000000005
it's oblivious to all of that now

5564.639 --> 5568.8
patrols and chills yes yeah but they

5566.8 --> 5571.1990000000005
called just that's just called media

5568.8 --> 5573.76
operations right

5571.199 --> 5575.5199999999995
so oh they get good funding why would

5573.76 --> 5579.04
that be could it be because they're

5575.52 --> 5581.120000000001
gonna uphold very specific

5579.04 --> 5584.239
levels of narrative

5581.12 --> 5586.8
that can never be dropped yes

5584.239 --> 5589.199
that's usually the reason

5586.8 --> 5591.76
i mean the real big media operations are

5589.199 --> 5593.919999999999
not there to inform you or to be flashy

5591.76 --> 5594.639
they're there

5593.92 --> 5597.76
to

5594.639 --> 5599.36
uphold a very specific long-term

5597.76 --> 5601.04
narrative says

5599.36 --> 5603.44
right even it's a little political it's

5601.04 --> 5605.76
not about that it's about making you

5603.44 --> 5608.0
believe in space and the moon landing

5605.76 --> 5608.0
and

5608.639 --> 5616.400000000001
and the the new form of christianity or

5612.88 --> 5618.639
what do they call it a

5616.4 --> 5621.839999999999
judea

5618.639 --> 5621.84
christianity right

5622.32 --> 5627.599999999999
judeo christian right that

5625.04 --> 5630.96
that's what it actually that's what's

5627.6 --> 5633.120000000001
actually happening

5630.96 --> 5636.32
that's what making yeah that that's the

5633.12 --> 5636.32
move that's the maneuver

5636.56 --> 5640.639
from one side the other side is just

5638.48 --> 5644.48
like no just turn it into a communist

5640.639 --> 5646.8
hellhole and erase everybody's mind

5644.48 --> 5649.678999999999
just keep hammering them psychologically

5646.8 --> 5653.150000000001
until they literally turn into zombies

bored with that [ __ ] it's only a matter

5794.639 --> 5799.400000000001
of time before they just run out of

5796.4 --> 5799.4
inspiration

5800.32 --> 5805.199
i mean especially if

5802.8 --> 5806.639
a lot of people do it guess what's gonna

5805.199 --> 5807.759999999999
happen they're all just gonna copy each

5806.639 --> 5808.8
other and

5807.76 --> 5811.679
it's gonna

5808.8 --> 5814.4800000000005
naturally form into like

5811.679 --> 5816.08
like news readers right

5814.48 --> 5818.239
remember how like

5816.08 --> 5820.32
those videos that show like news readers

5818.239 --> 5822.159
saying exactly the same thing in the

5820.32 --> 5824.96
same time period

5822.159 --> 5828.5599999999995
well that will naturally start to happen

5824.96 --> 5830.88
among all these pimped up channels

5828.56 --> 5832.4800000000005
and they're just talking about science

5830.88 --> 5834.96
nonsense

5832.48 --> 5837.678999999999
and astrophysics and blah and because

5834.96 --> 5840.0
there's so much of it and when

5837.679 --> 5841.92
you just get thousands and thousands of

5840.0 --> 5844.639
people doing that

5841.92 --> 5847.4400000000005
eventually they're all gonna blend into

5844.639 --> 5849.76
the same thing that is what is going to

5847.44 --> 5849.759999999999
happen

5850.56 --> 5854.8
not because they get cue cards for it

5852.639 --> 5857.36
like the news readers do

5854.8 --> 5860.400000000001
but because they will just start to

5857.36 --> 5862.5599999999995
maneuver like that in what they're doing

5860.4 --> 5864.799999999999
they will start to like oh that was

5862.56 --> 5866.159000000001
really good i'm going to do it like that

5864.8 --> 5870.320000000001
i'm going to look at each other until

5866.159 --> 5870.32
it's all one bland same thing

5872.56 --> 5879.1990000000005
and that's actually boring i mean i i'm

5875.199 --> 5879.199
not even interested in those videos

5880.239 --> 5885.199
and even before flat earth watching

5882.56 --> 5886.8
those you'd be like yeah

5885.199 --> 5889.839999999999
okay

5886.8 --> 5889.84
that sounds okay

5890.0 --> 5894.08
or oh like oh that sounds really well

5892.159 --> 5896.4
thought out

5894.08 --> 5899.04
not super interesting or useful or

5896.4 --> 5899.04
anything but

5900.239 --> 5904.799999999999
it just gets boring like even when i

5902.159 --> 5908.719
believe the ball it just got boring

5904.8 --> 5908.719
really quickly that sort of stuff

5916.08 --> 5921.5199999999995
i mean if i had the opportunity

5920.48 --> 5924.959999999999
say

5921.52 --> 5927.360000000001
15 years ago to watch me talking about

5924.96 --> 5929.6
what i talk about right now

5927.36 --> 5933.36
including as bowen i would have found

5929.6 --> 5933.360000000001
that a lot more interesting

5936.239 --> 5941.36
i mean even as a baller i would rather

5938.56 --> 5943.4400000000005
listen to me the flat earther talking

5941.36 --> 5945.44
about the ball

5943.44 --> 5947.119
than actual

5945.44 --> 5949.119

5947.119 --> 5951.119
just start squirting like they're all

5949.119 --> 5952.88

5951.119 --> 5955.36
when it's obvious they actually don't

5952.88 --> 5956.8
understand what they're doing

uh you could say that uh qe yesterday

6727.52 --> 6734.84

but he's not getting bullied

6743.44 --> 6748.28
that's kind of weird for you to say that

6758.639 --> 6764.32
he was just being held to task

6760.88 --> 6767.32
and he was mostly chanting a lot so not

6764.32 --> 6767.32
bullying

[Music]

6796.88 --> 6800.8

6798.88 --> 6803.1990000000005
procrastinating

all right

6803.76 --> 6808.56
well i'm not gonna make this like a

6805.28 --> 6808.5599999999995
three-hour show anyway

6808.8 --> 6811.52
i mean god

6810.239 --> 6814.48
like

6811.52 --> 6817.56
it's been a heavy week man

6814.48 --> 6817.5599999999995
i mean

6820.0 --> 6824.639
my own show

6822.08 --> 6826.96
flat the flat earth debate show and then

6824.639 --> 6828.16
like another show on top of that in the

evening

6828.16 --> 6833.5199999999995
[Music]

6830.719 --> 6835.119
and that happened like three times

6833.52 --> 6836.8
although with the one yesterday i

6835.119 --> 6839.04
actually did

6836.8 --> 6841.52
join the panel but i do have to like be

6839.04 --> 6843.679
present with these things to keep track

6841.52 --> 6847.719
of what's going on or i'm just gonna

6843.679 --> 6847.719
become completely oblivious

6862.0 --> 6865.76
that's the one you were talking about qe

well that's the last that's the last

6865.76 --> 6870.639
upload

6867.44 --> 6872.4
or the last stream on on quantum eraser

6870.639 --> 6876.84
channel

6872.4 --> 6876.839999999999
so i'll link you up to that

6879.28 --> 6884.679
i think it was quantum eraser it might

6881.04 --> 6884.679
be on nathan oakley's

6894.48 --> 6899.44

right

6899.44 --> 6902.678999999999
thank you

6914.56 --> 6919.280000000001
talking about professor dave

6916.639 --> 6921.84
uh i think there was an interview from

6919.28 --> 6924.4
some time ago where

6921.84 --> 6926.719
it was between david weiss and professor

6924.4 --> 6926.719
dave

6927.119 --> 6931.36
like on some platform i don't even know

6928.96 --> 6933.44
what that was

6931.36 --> 6936.48
but there was like a funny commentary

6933.44 --> 6939.839999999999
video that somebody made that

6936.48 --> 6939.839999999999
john thor uploaded

6941.599 --> 6945.599
i find it very entertaining and much

6943.44 --> 6947.759999999999
more doable to actually watch that than

6945.599 --> 6950.400000000001
if i had to sit through the raw thing

6947.76 --> 6952.96
because professor dave is just

6950.4 --> 6955.28
unbearable

6952.96 --> 6955.28
what

6955.76 --> 6959.360000000001
a smug

any

6960.239 --> 6964.718999999999
idiotic as well so

6962.639 --> 6967.119
that was fun

6964.719 --> 6969.28
this is that video

6967.119 --> 6972.839999999999
if you wanted to check that out

6969.28 --> 6972.84
yeah john thor

7005.119 --> 7008.92
mind shock okay

7016.32 --> 7018.96
i guess so

7019.04 --> 7025.239
yeah the link is in the description of

7020.88 --> 7025.2390000000005
john thor's video so yeah

7040.159 --> 7043.159
hmm

7047.92 --> 7051.28
oh wow this guy's like

7055.04 --> 7061.76
seems to have a couple of interesting

7057.36 --> 7063.598999999999
subjects on this channel mine shop huh

7061.76 --> 7066.719
this seems to be really over the place

7063.599 --> 7069.88

7081.199 --> 7086.598999999999

what

7091.28 --> 7094.0
well

7093.119 --> 7096.88
it is

7094.0 --> 7101.52
ideology

7096.88 --> 7103.599
when you prioritize ideology over truth

7101.52 --> 7106.320000000001
that is what causes circular reasoning

7103.599 --> 7106.32
and double speak

7110.239 --> 7116.159
yeah an ideology can

7112.239 --> 7120.678999999999
be fueled by religious interests

7116.159 --> 7120.679
or simply by raw power

7130.15 --> 7137.04
[Music]

7132.4 --> 7139.78

that is pathetic

7161.44 --> 7166.4

be balwin and go up against that

7166.4 --> 7172.879999999999
and i wouldn't even need

7169.52 --> 7177.4400000000005
like assistance or a script

7172.88 --> 7180.2390000000005
i would just improvise my way through it

7177.44 --> 7182.719
if he really got like

7180.239 --> 7185.839999999999
an earpiece with that or cue card that

7182.719 --> 7185.84
is really sad

7197.36 --> 7202.239
is my discord okay i don't know lva poll

7200.48 --> 7205.199
i think it's still there it's just that

7202.239 --> 7207.28
the server that where the activities

7205.199 --> 7210.0
the interesting activities were very

7207.28 --> 7213.119
server it's just gone it's been

7210.0 --> 7217.599
disabled shut off

7213.119 --> 7217.598999999999
it probably will not be turned on again

7220.88 --> 7225.1990000000005
i think that my original discord server

7223.52 --> 7228.159000000001
is still out there though but it's not

7225.199 --> 7228.159
really being used

besides we're moving to gilded now

7284.48 --> 7289.119
what okay gaining wisdom

7287.04 --> 7292.56
you're certainly very

7289.119 --> 7294.32
inquiring today uh it might make right a

7292.56 --> 7298.4800000000005
religious idea

7294.32 --> 7298.48
theory of man or idols what

7301.36 --> 7306.719
no might makes right is just

7304.639 --> 7311.56
a method

7306.719 --> 7311.56
it's just the foundation of autocracy

7321.92 --> 7325.119
theory no nature doesn't have any

7323.76 --> 7328.08
theories

7325.119 --> 7330.239
but it is a natural

7328.08 --> 7332.46
it is grounded in that well natural

7330.239 --> 7335.44
behavior

7332.46 --> 7337.679

7335.44 --> 7339.36
not that that makes it good i mean

7337.679 --> 7340.719
there's better ways

7339.36 --> 7342.96
but

7340.719 --> 7345.76
it is an option

7342.96 --> 7348.4800000000005
it's something you can fall back on when

7345.76 --> 7350.2390000000005
social contracts are broken when

7348.48 --> 7351.919999999999
powers are just not doing what they're

7350.239 --> 7355.48
supposed to do anymore and then yeah

7351.92 --> 7355.4800000000005

7489.679 --> 7493.84
he's already explained what he meant

7499.04 --> 7502.159
you've reified

7504.159 --> 7508.879999999999
i think what godzilla was just trying to

7506.56 --> 7510.0
say is that

7508.88 --> 7511.679
it's a

7510.0 --> 7514.32
conception

7511.679 --> 7519.32
inspired by nature

7690.96 --> 7693.96
beautiful

7707.599 --> 7714.419
yeah that's a good point gordzilla

7710.52 --> 7714.419000000001
[Music]

7720.079 --> 7724.0
right

7721.36 --> 7724.0
so anyway

7724.32 --> 7730.48
again remember that the the title of the

7727.119 --> 7732.719
show is actually like a little

7730.48 --> 7732.718999999999
map

7734.48 --> 7738.32
if you want to really be serious about

7736.56 --> 7739.360000000001
physics

7738.32 --> 7741.679
always

7739.36 --> 7742.839999999999
keep that map on you it's like a compass

7741.679 --> 7745.92
of

7742.84 --> 7748.639
forms a map or compass of forms and so

7745.92 --> 7748.639
you can always

7748.8 --> 7755.52
question everything that is named even

7752.159 --> 7758.839999999999
or described and then say is that really

7755.52 --> 7758.84
what it is

7759.36 --> 7763.598999999999
is it really that wave

7761.679 --> 7766.4800000000005
she will bump into a lot or is it

7763.599 --> 7769.04
actually one of the others

7766.48 --> 7772.159
and they call it a wave or they describe

7769.04 --> 7774.4
it as a wave based on something else

7772.159 --> 7776.48
it's an interpretation and not actual

7774.4 --> 7779.598999999999
proof of a wave or even a technical

7776.48 --> 7779.598999999999
claim of it it's just

7779.76 --> 7783.679
different

7781.04 --> 7786.239
so it's good to look back upon

7783.679 --> 7788.56
yeah these words beam field particle

7786.239 --> 7788.5599999999995
wave

7793.76 --> 7798.88
yes yes yeah no i will be going out

7796.32 --> 7798.88
