plan to be

182.319 --> 188.79999999999998

185.68 --> 192.239
three steps ahead of time

188.8 --> 192.959
i still managed to like be 10 minutes

192.239 --> 196.31900000000002
late

192.959 --> 196.31900000000002
it seems every time

196.72 --> 202.879
but oh well hey el

200.239 --> 202.879
etia

210.959 --> 216.159
so i'm gonna start up kind of easy

221.28 --> 225.599
cause it was a pretty late night last

223.12 --> 228.08
night uh if we even forgot to make all

225.599 --> 230.79899999999998
the notes

228.08 --> 230.799
stupid me

236.879 --> 240.0
but yeah i got all kinds of attention

239.04 --> 243.04
yesterday night

240.0 --> 245.92
like uh even my friend from name

243.04 --> 247.2
called me up like after 12 had a whole

245.92 --> 250.54
big story

247.2 --> 251.92
that last like two hours

250.54 --> 255.84
[Music]

251.92 --> 258.479
so i don't know a lot of ladies wanted

255.84 --> 261.6
my attention yesterday i think

258.479 --> 264.71999999999997
it was weird it's like i

261.6 --> 266.16
gave out this call like are you all

264.72 --> 268.639
right and it seems like

266.16 --> 270.16
a lot of women that i know just all

268.639 --> 274.32
simultaneously

270.16 --> 277.12
like heard that call even it wasn't

274.32 --> 278.8
verbally or text-wise directed that then

277.12 --> 280.96
they all heard it and they all called me

278.8 --> 280.96000000000004
out

281.52 --> 284.56
that was kind of weird

289.919 --> 298.96
but uh yeah yesterday was pretty

294.56 --> 301.28000000000003
intense overall very busy

298.96 --> 301.28
uh

302.24 --> 307.83
yeah the flat earth debates was pretty

304.16 --> 309.52000000000004
heavy again oh wow heavy it was good

307.83 --> 313.52
[Music]

309.52 --> 313.52
stayed pretty long after

316.88 --> 321.039
and i think there was an owen benjamin

319.199 --> 326.16
again

321.039 --> 326.15999999999997
yeah and then later the call

328.16 --> 339.84000000000003
but yeah at that point it just

331.6 --> 339.84000000000003
wasn't making notes anymore

340.4 --> 343.67999999999995
hey zach sterling

348.4 --> 353.84
yeah how's your research going

357.759 --> 364.08000000000004
let me try to adapt

360.8 --> 368.319
my sound it's just a little weird

364.08 --> 371.59999999999997
let's see how is it like this

368.319 --> 371.6
is it like that

375.759 --> 381.84000000000003
yes perfect that's perfectly symmetrical

384.24 --> 387.199
your name is fixed

391.84 --> 396.15999999999997
oh you took a night off to take care of

393.36 --> 396.16
your mother okay

396.4 --> 409.84
all right

412.56 --> 415.759
hope she's doing all right

417.759 --> 421.36
oh your name was oh that was you

421.599 --> 423.84
oh

429.039 --> 433.039
huh okay that's weird

433.12 --> 437.84000000000003
but anyway glad you were able to fix

434.88 --> 437.84
that

442.72 --> 446.16
so anybody else who was kind of weirded

444.72 --> 447.759
out yesterday

446.16 --> 450.8
don't know if he's listening or anything

447.759 --> 452.88
but mind of god

450.8 --> 455.199
being all nice and behaved all of a

452.88 --> 455.199
sudden

456.96 --> 463.28
although he was still like it was

460.16 --> 465.52000000000004
like he was still poking

463.28 --> 468.31899999999996
after good servant for some reason he

465.52 --> 471.28
wanted me to go after him and no

468.319 --> 471.28000000000003
it makes no sense

474.0 --> 479.52
i mean as far as i know

477.759 --> 481.12
from what's happened out there and not

479.52 --> 484.24
that i've really kept track

481.12 --> 485.28000000000003
too close in person but like as far as i

484.24 --> 489.12
know good servant

485.28 --> 493.75899999999996
isn't technically even coming after me

489.12 --> 496.08
so like why would i go after him

493.759 --> 498.40000000000003
you know what happened happened i'm

496.08 --> 501.75899999999996
still kind of pissed off about that

498.4 --> 503.75899999999996
i've expressed myself about it and yeah

501.759 --> 507.759
it makes no logical sense to go and

503.759 --> 510.56
attack him now

507.759 --> 512.9590000000001
but yeah maybe to him to my god that

510.56 --> 514.8
makes sense

512.959 --> 517.3599999999999
and i think that also good servant also

514.8 --> 520.399
went after him

517.36 --> 523.599
but yeah so did i

520.399 --> 526.72
it's just like yeah i'll

523.599 --> 528.32
just say exactly what i thought that's

526.72 --> 535.839
what i did

528.32 --> 535.839
so but i don't know

542.88 --> 547.4399999999999
better to stay above the mud slinging

544.88 --> 548.72
yeah and also it just serves absolutely

547.44 --> 550.72
no purpose

548.72 --> 552.0
like if i do that is that going to

550.72 --> 556.32
change what he's doing

552.0 --> 558.72
i doubt it i already

556.32 --> 559.36
yeah put in a whole lot of effort to try

558.72 --> 563.519
to

559.36 --> 565.44
basically dissuade him from continuing

563.519 --> 566.8
if he's not gonna respond to that at all

565.44 --> 569.9200000000001
i doubt that me

566.8 --> 573.12
go yeah attacking him criticizing him on

569.92 --> 573.12
my show is going to do

574.839 --> 577.839
anything

580.08 --> 584.32
it yeah it just has to sit out this

582.24 --> 591.839
crazy ride he decided to go on

584.32 --> 591.839
and and then we'll see what happens

596.24 --> 599.839
anyway good to see you again in chat

602.839 --> 605.839
samson

616.839 --> 622.24
right

619.04 --> 625.279
so at the moment i'm kind of

622.24 --> 625.279
like a blank slate

626.56 --> 631.5999999999999
so don't have a lot of subject i was

629.2 --> 634.0
specifically thinking about

631.6 --> 635.6
it's i don't know in recent times a lot

634.0 --> 639.04
of my thoughts are kind of

635.6 --> 639.0400000000001
to me general

640.16 --> 643.279
but that also means that i could just

641.839 --> 645.519
pick them out of the air

643.279 --> 646.8
at at a moment's notice without a lot of

645.519 --> 648.5600000000001
attention

646.8 --> 650.7199999999999
and then i don't really remember a lot

648.56 --> 652.64
of details on the long run of it either

650.72 --> 661.839
i'll just pick it up again once it

652.64 --> 661.8389999999999
becomes relevant

670.079 --> 675.8389999999999
ah damn it hold on

687.92 --> 692.959
all right ah is there an fed today there

690.56 --> 692.959
should be

696.88 --> 703.8389999999999
i know ah man i'm like suddenly i got

700.0 --> 703.839
like this sneeze in my nose

708.05 --> 711.0699999999999
[Music]

714.839 --> 717.839
annoying

724.959 --> 731.8389999999999
i'm gonna blame the weather for it

728.88 --> 731.8389999999999
hey brandon

733.68 --> 738.56
there won't be an early bird show

735.6 --> 738.5600000000001
tomorrow why not

741.36 --> 745.839
unless nobody's gonna be there

765.839 --> 772.639
now that's a second christmas day and

768.079 --> 776.4799999999999
i'll still do my show

772.639 --> 776.48
because i go to him in the afternoon

781.839 --> 786.8000000000001
all right well just so you guys know i

784.88 --> 789.12
don't have anything special i'm just

786.8 --> 794.0
going to be doing what i always do

789.12 --> 794.0
just let as i did last year and the year

794.74 --> 797.919
[Music]

798.839 --> 801.839
before

803.12 --> 806.72
and i don't know maybe i'll pick up on

805.12 --> 807.68
something interesting to talk about

806.72 --> 810.88
tomorrow it's just

807.68 --> 812.8389999999999
i don't know man recently it's just i

810.88 --> 814.32
started out the show really as a blank

812.839 --> 817.839
slate

814.32 --> 820.32
maybe it's because of just

817.839 --> 821.519
during the night when i sleep i really

820.32 --> 824.72
now calm down

821.519 --> 826.48
a lot because

824.72 --> 828.5600000000001
later in the night usually i have to

826.48 --> 832.48
really push myself to go to bed because

828.56 --> 832.4799999999999
even though i'm tired my mind is just

833.12 --> 837.279
yeah taking a long swim in everything

835.519 --> 839.199
that's happened and it's been brought to

837.279 --> 843.36
my attention and everything

839.199 --> 845.3599999999999
and i tried to find bridges between the

843.36 --> 848.24
bigger

845.36 --> 850.0790000000001
things and yeah dark world situations

848.24 --> 852.8
start to present themselves again

850.079 --> 853.12
and all that it constantly happens so

852.8 --> 856.079
just

853.12 --> 857.68
my mind is just if i wouldn't sleep i

856.079 --> 859.76
would just

857.68 --> 860.88
keep on doing that but when i sleep i

859.76 --> 863.76
often

860.88 --> 864.639
it just really stops and then i wake up

863.76 --> 866.639
and then it

864.639 --> 868.32
takes a while before it starts going

866.639 --> 870.399
again usually during

868.32 --> 872.0
the flat earth debates it it becomes

870.399 --> 874.88
fully active again

872.0 --> 876.959
although sometimes it doesn't it's

874.88 --> 880.399
almost like

876.959 --> 881.4399999999999
the fully activated process does not

880.399 --> 883.6
want to reveal

881.44 --> 885.44
itself to the public sometimes it's

883.6 --> 887.839
weird that's kind of like how it feels

885.44 --> 890.5600000000001
to be when that happens

887.839 --> 890.5600000000001
but i don't know

890.79 --> 894.429
[Music]

897.36 --> 900.88
oh all right here we go again

902.32 --> 913.839
too much holiday distractions right

916.16 --> 920.88
i totally recognize what you're doing by

918.079 --> 922.959
the way here we go because yeah

920.88 --> 924.959
you just went through the entire series

922.959 --> 927.8389999999999
pretty much although there's one last

924.959 --> 930.959
movie right

927.839 --> 933.839
and then you just want other people

930.959 --> 934.3199999999999
to watch it too because then they'll

933.839 --> 937.36
have

934.32 --> 941.839
like that first journey and you can it's

937.36 --> 941.839
because it is that impressive

944.48 --> 948.48
what kind of dark world situation no

946.16 --> 951.04
it's just memory cross-referencing

948.48 --> 951.04
everything

952.839 --> 955.839
then

966.839 --> 969.839
right

980.839 --> 983.839
right

984.56 --> 990.16
hey judy of heaven good to see you

988.16 --> 991.519
yeah but i totally get here we go again

990.16 --> 996.079
it's because it

991.519 --> 1000.9590000000001
is just really an impressive series and

996.079 --> 1000.959
it's kind of like very overt

1001.12 --> 1004.9590000000001
with like the corruptions and the

1003.199 --> 1008.4799999999999
villainy

1004.959 --> 1012.16
but like they

1008.48 --> 1015.1990000000001
they rubbed away some of the

1012.16 --> 1018.3199999999999
yeah to just make it more visible

1015.199 --> 1018.3199999999999
but other than that

1018.399 --> 1021.92
like that little polishing so it becomes

1020.48 --> 1025.919
more overt

1021.92 --> 1028.48
it's all pretty yeah

1025.919 --> 1028.959
realistic in ways like they all present

1028.48 --> 1032.319
real

1028.959 --> 1036.24
realistic human issues

1032.319 --> 1040.24
like a lot of them a lot of different

1036.24 --> 1040.24
like a whole bunch of things

1041.039 --> 1045.36
like babylon 5 is really like this big

1043.039 --> 1046.24
cup in which like all the problems you

1045.36 --> 1048.559
can conceive

1046.24 --> 1051.1200000000001
are poured and they're all just trying

1048.559 --> 1053.84
to figure it out and survive it

1051.12 --> 1053.84
in a way

1055.12 --> 1062.7199999999998
real life in space yeah

1059.919 --> 1063.2
but it is really impressive like how

1062.72 --> 1065.28
much

1063.2 --> 1067.8400000000001
stuff actually happens throughout the

1065.28 --> 1067.84
series

1068.4 --> 1072.799
like it's not just oh this happens and

1071.12 --> 1073.36
then that happens and then that happens

1072.799 --> 1077.52
but no

1073.36 --> 1080.799
like constant big transitional changes

1077.52 --> 1083.679
like big events like a lot of big events

1080.799 --> 1086.0
happen on a regular basis at pablo five

1083.679 --> 1088.88
it's super impressive

1086.0 --> 1089.52
like that and it is also kind of like a

1088.88 --> 1094.0
world

1089.52 --> 1096.16
war type of situation

1094.0 --> 1098.64
not just oh they all start attacking but

1096.16 --> 1102.96
just complicated relations

1098.64 --> 1104.0800000000002
constantly little things that ruin whole

1102.96 --> 1108.0
big things and

1104.08 --> 1110.3999999999999
just yeah it's really heavy [ __ ]

1108.0 --> 1110.4
anyway

1112.08 --> 1116.559
yeah once you start watching it's very

1115.44 --> 1118.88
tough to

1116.559 --> 1120.16
to stop i try to warn here we go again

1118.88 --> 1123.2800000000002
about it

1120.16 --> 1127.039
just like don't sit through it

1123.28 --> 1128.72
all in one go take it easy but yeah you

1127.039 --> 1131.679
couldn't help yourself could you

1128.72 --> 1131.679
well neither could i

1132.96 --> 1137.8400000000001
like the first time so i do get it

1148.4 --> 1153.2
i also like to binge episode oh god well

1151.84 --> 1154.799
brenda i'm with

1153.2 --> 1158.24
babylon 5 you don't know what you're

1154.799 --> 1158.24
talking about it's too big

1158.48 --> 1161.28
it's so big

1162.72 --> 1166.64
there's is it 22 episodes a season five

1166.0 --> 1170.4
seasons

1166.64 --> 1170.4
and like 10 movies

1171.12 --> 1178.08
it's a lot it's a big series

1174.799 --> 1180.24
and it's not like oh you'll just

1178.08 --> 1183.36
quickly run through them it's because a

1180.24 --> 1186.0
lot of intense things happen

1183.36 --> 1186.8799999999999
and it especially like if you miss a

1186.0 --> 1189.76
episode

1186.88 --> 1190.24
by accident you will start to get gaps

1189.76 --> 1192.08
because

1190.24 --> 1194.24
in in what is in understanding what's

1192.08 --> 1196.32
going on because it is important

1194.24 --> 1197.6
like every in every episode something

1196.32 --> 1201.6
happens

1197.6 --> 1204.8799999999999
that is of relevance to other things

1201.6 --> 1208.32
although yeah not all plot thing some

1204.88 --> 1208.3200000000002
there are some weird little

1208.799 --> 1212.8799999999999
plot situations also happening like side

1212.0 --> 1215.76
plots

1212.88 --> 1216.3200000000002
sort of cultural injections of things

1215.76 --> 1219.2
that

1216.32 --> 1221.84
are kind of silly in a way it does stand

1219.2 --> 1221.8400000000001
out

1227.52 --> 1232.24
like something that everybody that'll

1230.24 --> 1232.88
watch it will notice very quickly is

1232.24 --> 1237.76
that they

1232.88 --> 1241.44
really like the arthur legend

1237.76 --> 1245.6
like throughout the whole series

1241.44 --> 1248.64
like they do style-wise

1245.6 --> 1249.6
try to remind you of it with situations

1248.64 --> 1253.44
and with things and

1249.6 --> 1255.84
it yeah that stood out to me

1253.44 --> 1258.4
and even quite literal somebody that is

1255.84 --> 1258.3999999999999
like oh

1259.039 --> 1262.799
that's like extreme guilt issues because

1261.52 --> 1264.96
of some

1262.799 --> 1267.12
yeah a terrible war situation and then

1264.96 --> 1269.679
they

1267.12 --> 1270.4799999999998
think that they are king arthur and then

1269.679 --> 1272.64
they really

1270.48 --> 1274.88
psychologically think that it's like

1272.64 --> 1277.2800000000002
okay

1274.88 --> 1278.64
not too overt right yeah yeah it is

1277.28 --> 1280.24
super overt

1278.64 --> 1283.76
but everything that they do in the

1280.24 --> 1283.76
series is just very overt

1284.0 --> 1287.12
not in a day well there is not enough

1286.559 --> 1289.12
hours

1287.12 --> 1292.559
in a day to watch the entire thing it's

1289.12 --> 1292.559
just physically impossible

1298.32 --> 1302.559
brett m but don't teach class again

1302.159 --> 1305.6000000000001
until

1302.559 --> 1308.799
january all right

1305.6 --> 1308.799
teaching from home oh

1314.0 --> 1319.6
what explain how we can disprove the

1316.96 --> 1321.28
radio signals to the moon oh

1319.6 --> 1323.6789999999999
you get stuck on that oh that's funny

1321.28 --> 1325.28
that you mentioned that zack sterling

1323.679 --> 1326.799
yeah let's get back to flat earth

1325.28 --> 1328.72
situation this is

1326.799 --> 1330.4
this babylon 5 talk to people that

1328.72 --> 1332.799
haven't actually watched it is kind of

1330.4 --> 1334.48
lame i guess

1332.799 --> 1337.039
maybe they don't want to watch it it's

1334.48 --> 1340.159
in space it has the word babylon in it

1337.039 --> 1340.1589999999999
for crying out loud

1342.08 --> 1350.96
right uh

1346.4 --> 1355.679
yeah zack sterling i i did a special

1350.96 --> 1358.0
i addressed that the radio moon signal

1355.679 --> 1359.2
now the thing is it's never really been

1358.0 --> 1362.0
properly proven

1359.2 --> 1363.3600000000001
that that is possible it's like a

1362.0 --> 1365.28
popular claim that

1363.36 --> 1366.9599999999998
certain people like to reinforce by

1365.28 --> 1369.2
saying oh look i'm doing that

1366.96 --> 1369.2
see

1370.159 --> 1374.0800000000002
the computer says there is a signal and

1372.72 --> 1376.88
look i'm holding this

1374.08 --> 1378.0
thing up so it's working that sort of

1376.88 --> 1379.919
thing it's

1378.0 --> 1382.159
or not even that just like oh look the

1379.919 --> 1385.3600000000001
computer screen says there's a signal

1382.159 --> 1385.679
and i'm doing this like i'm not showing

1385.36 --> 1389.039
you

1385.679 --> 1389.76
how that works or varying the signal

1389.039 --> 1391.6
direction

1389.76 --> 1393.2
to basically prove oh look you're not

1391.6 --> 1394.1589999999999
pointing it at the moon so now there's

1393.2 --> 1396.799
no signal

1394.159 --> 1398.48
no none of that is out there and i

1396.799 --> 1400.8799999999999
figured that out and i complained about

1398.48 --> 1403.44
it towards the ballers

1400.88 --> 1405.8400000000001
some time ago even like dedicated entire

1403.44 --> 1409.1200000000001
episode to that concept

1405.84 --> 1411.039
to say yeah to basically put down

1409.12 --> 1412.2399999999998
okay if you really want to prove that

1411.039 --> 1414.4
that is possible

1412.24 --> 1415.52
which is would be very very mysterious

1414.4 --> 1417.1200000000001
if it were

1415.52 --> 1419.52
then this is how you do it you have a

1417.12 --> 1422.9599999999998
three camera setup

1419.52 --> 1425.279
one camera on the radio transmission

1422.96 --> 1428.08
device

1425.279 --> 1429.76
which should hopefully be hand held so

1428.08 --> 1431.6
you can point it

1429.76 --> 1433.44
with a camera pointing at directly where

1431.6 --> 1435.12
it's going to point so you can show on

1433.44 --> 1437.279
that fit on that camera

1435.12 --> 1439.4399999999998
like look i am pointing this thing

1437.279 --> 1441.36
directly towards the moon

1439.44 --> 1443.039
and now i'm pointing away from the moon

1441.36 --> 1446.3999999999999
right so you can prove that

1443.039 --> 1447.44
in the in the video one camera on the

1446.4 --> 1451.44
computer

1447.44 --> 1455.919
read out to do yeah to close up

1451.44 --> 1457.88
just show like how the signal is varying

1455.919 --> 1459.6000000000001
and then have those two screens

1457.88 --> 1462.0800000000002
simultaneously

1459.6 --> 1463.6
visible and then the last screen which

1462.08 --> 1467.36
is a

1463.6 --> 1469.9189999999999
camera from the background showing

1467.36 --> 1470.9599999999998
both things in one screen so that you

1469.919 --> 1473.2
can literally see

1470.96 --> 1474.0
in one shot the computer screen and the

1473.2 --> 1477.279
person

1474.0 --> 1479.84
that they're pointing and aiming the the

1477.279 --> 1483.12
the transmission device so you can have

1479.84 --> 1486.1589999999999
the three shots in one video

1483.12 --> 1488.1589999999999
all synchronized so yeah you can show

1486.159 --> 1490.0800000000002
like this is really happening this is

1488.159 --> 1493.0390000000002
exactly what you're seeing

1490.08 --> 1495.279
and then point yeah then do the

1493.039 --> 1498.559
experiment or the test

1495.279 --> 1501.12
pointing the transmit

1498.559 --> 1503.36
transmitter to the moon and seeing if

1501.12 --> 1506.559
there's a signal feedback

1503.36 --> 1510.4799999999998
and nobody's nobody's done that that's

1506.559 --> 1510.48
been out here for over a year now

1513.039 --> 1518.64
and there it's not happening so this

1516.08 --> 1520.8799999999999
it's a myth there is no signal there's

1518.64 --> 1525.919
no proof that this actually works

1520.88 --> 1528.0
nobody's done it to my satisfaction

1525.919 --> 1530.159
supposedly videos out there but none of

1528.0 --> 1532.0
them get even close to doing anything

1530.159 --> 1542.0
like what i just described

1532.0 --> 1544.24
not even close

1542.0 --> 1547.12
no they never show it they just show you

1544.24 --> 1548.799
oh look it's a technical setup and maybe

1547.12 --> 1550.799
an antenna or whatever

1548.799 --> 1552.8799999999999
and a computer readout and nothing is

1550.799 --> 1556.0
varied the moon is not even shown

1552.88 --> 1559.2
to be in the sky in any

1556.0 --> 1560.48
of it it's complete it's completely

1559.2 --> 1562.64
ridiculous it's just

1560.48 --> 1564.88
they say this is what they're doing and

1562.64 --> 1568.64
then you have to believe it

1564.88 --> 1571.8400000000001
that's what it is that's all it is

1568.64 --> 1571.8400000000001
in those videos every time

1573.2 --> 1577.039
yeah and i even went to baller ball or

1576.32 --> 1580.559
hangout

1577.039 --> 1582.8799999999999
was it over at jose's i think

1580.559 --> 1584.8799999999999
and just said like yeah can you bring me

1582.88 --> 1586.72
this evidence please

1584.88 --> 1588.5590000000002
and they showed yeah they linked me up

1586.72 --> 1590.64
with several videos

1588.559 --> 1593.2
and yeah exactly like what i thought

1590.64 --> 1595.919
none of them

1593.2 --> 1598.32
would show any of it they would yeah do

1595.919 --> 1600.7990000000002
exactly what i just said

1598.32 --> 1602.1589999999999
just tell you oh look it oh look there's

1600.799 --> 1603.6
a signal from the moon look at the

1602.159 --> 1605.3600000000001
computer screen

1603.6 --> 1609.279
and that's it not even show the moon is

1605.36 --> 1609.279
in the sky none of the videos did that

1612.559 --> 1619.279
people are liars

1615.6 --> 1621.52
well the people that made those videos

1619.279 --> 1623.039
claiming there's a signal to the moon

1621.52 --> 1625.679
yes those seem to be

1623.039 --> 1627.039
very much like conspiracy i don't know

1625.679 --> 1630.48
how that works maybe through

1627.039 --> 1634.1589999999999
freemasonry or something or through some

1630.48 --> 1636.559
the secret radio guild because i think

1634.159 --> 1639.1200000000001
yeah i think that is something that

1636.559 --> 1642.96
exists there's a lot of conspiracies

1639.12 --> 1646.7199999999998
from the media world a lot of it

1642.96 --> 1648.72
seems to be centered around that

1646.72 --> 1649.76
so there's probably some guys that are

1648.72 --> 1654.32
just there

1649.76 --> 1657.039
ordered or maybe voluntarily or whatever

1654.32 --> 1659.52
maybe they get paid for it they're just

1657.039 --> 1662.32
doing that to reinforce the idea that it

1659.52 --> 1665.84
is possible to reinforce heliocentrism

1662.32 --> 1668.0
media organizations starting with

1665.84 --> 1670.0
radio i really think that it started

1668.0 --> 1673.2
with radio

1670.0 --> 1675.2
the baller propaganda really started

1673.2 --> 1677.279
when radio broke

1675.2 --> 1679.1200000000001
that's when it it really booted up in

1677.279 --> 1682.88
the world

1679.12 --> 1687.52
when it when it unrolled and

1682.88 --> 1690.48
yeah that's where you find all the myths

1687.52 --> 1690.8799999999999
the heliocentric myths about satellites

1690.48 --> 1694.32
right

1690.88 --> 1695.279
started with radio right and signal to

1694.32 --> 1699.9189999999999
the moon

1695.279 --> 1699.919
all these things come through radio

1705.6 --> 1709.84
so yes i'm sure there are people that

1707.76 --> 1711.679
are literally faking it now

1709.84 --> 1713.52
again it gets complex because some of

1711.679 --> 1716.96
these people might

1713.52 --> 1718.399
be faking it thinking that it should be

1716.96 --> 1720.559
possible but they are

1718.399 --> 1722.1589999999999
confused why it's not possible thinking

1720.559 --> 1722.799
that they're actually doing something

1722.159 --> 1725.6000000000001
wrong

1722.799 --> 1727.36
and then they presented anyway because

1725.6 --> 1729.6
they don't want to be the guy pointing

1727.36 --> 1731.279
out the emperor is wearing no clothes

1729.6 --> 1733.1999999999998
and they just think no i'll just work

1731.279 --> 1735.84
along with it

1733.2 --> 1736.3990000000001
even though i'm actually trying to fool

1735.84 --> 1738.32
people

1736.399 --> 1740.799
because i trust that it should be

1738.32 --> 1744.6399999999999
possible but i can't figure out

1740.799 --> 1746.72
how right that could also be

1744.64 --> 1748.96
what those people are doing this gets

1746.72 --> 1749.84
very very complicated when you're

1748.96 --> 1752.88
dealing with

1749.84 --> 1756.399
yeah a occult religion

1752.88 --> 1759.44
which is what it is he illustrism

1756.399 --> 1762.32
it's a religion that

1759.44 --> 1764.48
psychologically tries to convince you

1762.32 --> 1767.84
it's not a religion like

1764.48 --> 1767.84
really heavily

1772.08 --> 1780.799
anyway science fiction used as real

1776.72 --> 1781.76
right because at some point who can tell

1780.799 --> 1784.0
the difference

1781.76 --> 1786.0
and it was even said like oh look at all

1784.0 --> 1786.88
the science fiction the science fiction

1786.0 --> 1790.159
actually

1786.88 --> 1791.2
like all these writers say that science

1790.159 --> 1794.64
fiction

1791.2 --> 1798.0
builds the future oh really

1794.64 --> 1802.64
so it builds the reality

1798.0 --> 1802.64
of what it's going to be oh well

1803.44 --> 1807.679
maybe that is true but not in the way

1805.36 --> 1809.52
you think maybe they are not oh they are

1807.679 --> 1811.679
figuring it out with their vision of the

1809.52 --> 1817.2
future and oh it turns out that it

1811.679 --> 1817.2
is real maybe it's the other way around

1818.24 --> 1822.0
without realizing it or with realizing

1821.6 --> 1825.279
it

1822.0 --> 1826.559
they are literally building future plans

1825.279 --> 1829.919
to which

1826.559 --> 1833.6
the heliocentric religion will

1829.919 --> 1836.72
adapt and latch onto and make it

1833.6 --> 1837.84
the claimed reality maybe that's how it

1836.72 --> 1840.08
works

1837.84 --> 1842.24
because heliocentrism is constantly in

1840.08 --> 1846.0
development it's the religion that

1842.24 --> 1849.279
constantly changes transforms

1846.0 --> 1852.08
adapts it's like oh wait we were

1849.279 --> 1852.88
wrong about this all along so now we're

1852.08 --> 1856.0
going to change

1852.88 --> 1858.3990000000001
this distance or this number to this

1856.0 --> 1859.44
and that's just accepted like it always

1858.399 --> 1862.08
was

1859.44 --> 1863.039
because it is suddenly realized that

1862.08 --> 1879.84
they were

1863.039 --> 1879.84
wrong right

1891.12 --> 1894.9599999999998
roll out of radio waves connected to the

1893.039 --> 1898.96
spanish flu yes speaking star wars

1894.96 --> 1899.6000000000001
i've heard that too interestingly enough

1898.96 --> 1903.279
it's

1899.6 --> 1906.48
through uh

1903.279 --> 1908.799
one of the people that even i think

1906.48 --> 1910.32
directly or indirectly talked about it

1908.799 --> 1913.6
or this community

1910.32 --> 1913.6
was the rule of steiner

1913.679 --> 1918.5590000000002
was rudolf steiner and his people that

1916.559 --> 1920.559
were yeah sympathizing

1918.559 --> 1922.399
with that and developing that german new

1920.559 --> 1926.24
medicine all that

1922.399 --> 1928.32
they actually tried to point that out

1926.24 --> 1930.64
and it might have been caused by like a

1928.32 --> 1934.1589999999999
yeah sudden

1930.64 --> 1937.2
electric ether disruption

1934.159 --> 1940.24
like being electromagnetically or

1937.2 --> 1942.0
however you see that disturbed

1940.24 --> 1944.48
and that that caused like massive

1942.0 --> 1944.48
sickness

1944.559 --> 1949.6789999999999
like a big curse that suddenly unrolled

1946.799 --> 1951.519
and doesn't stop anymore

1949.679 --> 1963.8400000000001
but yeah we've all for several

1951.519 --> 1963.84
generations now grew up in that

1965.44 --> 1970.72
so yeah whatever would have killed those

1968.32 --> 1972.72
people

1970.72 --> 1975.2
from the unroll if it is actually the

1972.72 --> 1977.279
cause because i can't purely prove that

1975.2 --> 1978.3990000000001
might have also involved with vaccine

1977.279 --> 1981.519
programs

1978.399 --> 1983.3899999999999
it's it's complicated it is really

1981.519 --> 1985.2
complicated

1983.39 --> 1987.279
[Music]

1985.2 --> 1990.88
but yeah let's just say that this

1987.279 --> 1992.64
vulnerability to radio

1990.88 --> 1995.279
that that caused all these people to die

1992.64 --> 1998.0800000000002
well that's still going to cause

1995.279 --> 1999.76
basically yeah this sounds really bad

1998.08 --> 2002.24
but

1999.76 --> 2002.96
let's say that that vulnerability can

2002.24 --> 2006.24
still pop

2002.96 --> 2009.44
up in people well then they'll just

2006.24 --> 2011.2
they're just very likely to die during

2009.44 --> 2014.0
conception

2011.2 --> 2014.3990000000001
like they want as soon as they start to

2014.0 --> 2016.88
like

2014.399 --> 2018.0
as soon as the egg becomes fertilized it

2016.88 --> 2020.64
starts to

2018.0 --> 2023.76
develop and then at some point the radio

2020.64 --> 2026.88
influence just disrupts it

2023.76 --> 2029.6
and then yeah doesn't work so we

2026.88 --> 2033.44
wouldn't even notice

2029.6 --> 2034.9599999999998
that potentially people are still dying

2033.44 --> 2037.039
because of the influence that if it

2034.96 --> 2038.3990000000001
wasn't there there would be other types

2037.039 --> 2041.2
of people

2038.399 --> 2044.0
that would have been able to survive

2041.2 --> 2046.72
that would be born

2044.0 --> 2048.32
right but yeah i don't think it's gonna

2046.72 --> 2052.56
go away

2048.32 --> 2056.32
so like if it would that would be

2052.56 --> 2058.96
freaky and yeah how are we gonna replace

2056.32 --> 2060.0
all of its influences then it would have

2058.96 --> 2063.359
be it would have to

2060.0 --> 2064.72
be a very very well connected wired

2063.359 --> 2066.72
world

2064.72 --> 2068.0
if we would want to survive completely

2066.72 --> 2075.839
without

2068.0 --> 2075.839
radio influences

2076.079 --> 2082.32
5g causing powerful disruptions well 5g

2079.28 --> 2085.3590000000004
has very little range but

2082.32 --> 2088.56
yes the potential disruption

2085.359 --> 2090.96
of 5g can be pretty dramatic doesn't

2088.56 --> 2093.599
mean that it will be per default but

2090.96 --> 2095.119
it is a potential it's like in the

2093.599 --> 2099.04
technology

2095.119 --> 2103.76
it's even been used for that secretly

2099.04 --> 2107.68
because it has existed for a while

2103.76 --> 2109.8390000000004
but yeah the 5g look

2107.68 --> 2112.0
the in the thing that caused all this

2109.839 --> 2114.56
disease

2112.0 --> 2116.4
or presumed the spanish flu if that is

2114.56 --> 2119.92
actually the case

2116.4 --> 2121.28
that influence yeah that cannot really

2119.92 --> 2125.839
be topped it's just

2121.28 --> 2125.8390000000004
is the electric ether or whatever

2126.48 --> 2131.28
has been altered by the presence of

2128.839 --> 2134.16
radio

2131.28 --> 2135.2000000000003
is it influence or is it not influenced

2134.16 --> 2137.04
because

2135.2 --> 2139.04
i think that it doesn't really matter

2137.04 --> 2143.44
even how much

2139.04 --> 2146.079
radio or this radio disruption

2143.44 --> 2147.76
is even present in general once there is

2146.079 --> 2150.079
that influence

2147.76 --> 2151.28
that is really the big thing that can

2150.079 --> 2154.0
basically cause

2151.28 --> 2155.76
certain types of people to to die if it

2154.0 --> 2158.56
becomes present

2155.76 --> 2160.32
from a state where it's not present and

2158.56 --> 2163.839
then i think that people that

2160.32 --> 2166.56
don't die from that

2163.839 --> 2168.4
yeah they may have like bad influences

2166.56 --> 2170.56
from heavy 5g

2168.4 --> 2173.04
but it's not like certainly like oh the

2170.56 --> 2174.88
5g is switched on and like oh my god

2173.04 --> 2176.24
they suddenly become sick and die like

2174.88 --> 2180.2400000000002
the spanish flu

2176.24 --> 2180.24
i think that is extremely unlikely

2180.48 --> 2185.2
but they will eventually especially if

2183.599 --> 2187.3590000000004
they get all up close to

2185.2 --> 2189.359
those things and just keep on pumping

2187.359 --> 2191.2
data constantly yeah they will have

2189.359 --> 2193.2799999999997
they will have negative influences just

2191.2 --> 2197.839
like people

2193.28 --> 2201.0400000000004
at radar stations back in the day

2197.839 --> 2203.2799999999997
would yeah get sick and die

2201.04 --> 2206.72
if they were yeah if they were sitting

2203.28 --> 2206.7200000000003
right next to the transmitter

2207.599 --> 2210.2400000000002
constantly

2211.599 --> 2216.6400000000003
but you'd have to go pretty far to

2213.92 --> 2216.64
achieve that

2219.52 --> 2227.04
so yeah it's a bit it's a bit over

2222.72 --> 2230.16
over dramatic the story is about 5g

2227.04 --> 2233.359
but it is still it's there's still

2230.16 --> 2236.0789999999997
a real issue with it

2233.359 --> 2238.64
but it's not just a 5g it's just this

2236.079 --> 2242.6400000000003
trend of constantly trying to

2238.64 --> 2243.359
amplify the radio signal getting more

2242.64 --> 2245.7599999999998
data

2243.359 --> 2247.839
more more and more that is the problem

2245.76 --> 2250.88
that is the real problem

2247.839 --> 2253.7599999999998
because we don't really need it anymore

2250.88 --> 2254.2400000000002
and there's other ways to deal with the

2253.76 --> 2257.119
this

2254.24 --> 2258.64
artificial information crisis which is

2257.119 --> 2260.56
kind of what drives it it's like oh but

2258.64 --> 2263.52
we need more bandwidth

2260.56 --> 2264.48
yeah that's because the stuff that's

2263.52 --> 2268.88
being produced

2264.48 --> 2272.32
is sloppy it's not data efficient

2268.88 --> 2276.0
this is even an issue with with games

2272.32 --> 2276.0
a lot of the times is that it's just

2276.32 --> 2279.599
they're getting sloppy because they're

2278.4 --> 2283.2000000000003
just using the

2279.599 --> 2285.28
the room that they can use

2283.2 --> 2289.04
to just do things the way they like

2285.28 --> 2289.0400000000004
instead of making things efficient

2290.0 --> 2294.32
and it just makes things slow and then

2292.24 --> 2296.7999999999997
oh we need more power

2294.32 --> 2298.2400000000002
more calculation power more bandwidth to

2296.8 --> 2302.88
deal with this

2298.24 --> 2306.56
so it's it's just gross inefficiency

2302.88 --> 2309.04
forcing all this radio signal power and

2306.56 --> 2309.599
calculation power to just become more

2309.04 --> 2314.4
more and more

2309.599 --> 2317.52
to like artificially grow it

2314.4 --> 2318.48
it's not necessary there's other ways to

2317.52 --> 2321.44
deal with it but no

2318.48 --> 2327.839
that people aren't doing it corporations

2321.44 --> 2327.839
aren't doing it

2349.92 --> 2354.16
aspirin and appear yeah aspirin was also

2352.56 --> 2357.52
a big problem

2354.16 --> 2359.92
but look you see it just

2357.52 --> 2362.16
it's exactly my point there are many

2359.92 --> 2362.64
suspicions of specific things that might

2362.16 --> 2365.52
have

2362.64 --> 2368.72
caused it right well maybe it's a

2365.52 --> 2370.96
compounded situation of all of it

2368.72 --> 2373.1189999999997
maybe it was just this crossroads moment

2370.96 --> 2376.88
where all kinds of things unfolded

2373.119 --> 2378.88
maybe the aspirin maybe the radio at the

2376.88 --> 2379.52
same time maybe they also unrolled that

2378.88 --> 2381.839
what if it

2379.52 --> 2384.079
all happened at the same time and that

2381.839 --> 2387.119
is what caused

2384.079 --> 2389.3590000000004
it to be so severe

2387.119 --> 2389.359
see

2393.599 --> 2401.119
right and then you can definitely

2397.839 --> 2404.0
basically figure it out using the

2401.119 --> 2404.8
terrain theory it's like yeah it's just

2404.0 --> 2407.599
the environment

2404.8 --> 2407.599
suddenly becomes

2408.0 --> 2412.8
dramatically worse from several factors

2410.96 --> 2414.56
at the same time yeah

2412.8 --> 2416.7200000000003
from out of nowhere that's definitely

2414.56 --> 2418.72
gonna cause

2416.72 --> 2420.0
well like a revolution it's gonna kill

2418.72 --> 2422.56
people it's

2420.0 --> 2424.64
like a microbiological revolution it's

2422.56 --> 2428.56
so toxic all of a sudden

2424.64 --> 2431.7599999999998
and people don't even know why that yeah

2428.56 --> 2439.839
that might just do something that is

2431.76 --> 2439.8390000000004
that dramatic

2440.48 --> 2445.76
very over counted what do you mean

2450.839 --> 2453.839
random

2455.44 --> 2459.119
right it was not everywhere

2459.68 --> 2466.0789999999997
that's correct right now i know

2463.76 --> 2468.1600000000003
but it the thing about it is that it was

2466.079 --> 2470.48
so sudden

2468.16 --> 2473.5989999999997
a sudden and everywhere that was really

2470.48 --> 2473.599
the telling thing that's

2474.77 --> 2478.2889999999998
[Music]

2478.64 --> 2495.839
that's what made it memorable i guess

2482.96 --> 2495.839
hey terminoid

2500.88 --> 2509.839
no i don't think that seeking star wars

2504.4 --> 2509.839
i don't think so

2521.04 --> 2525.52
but i think that if there were several

2523.359 --> 2526.96
different things at play that would

2525.52 --> 2531.28
cause

2526.96 --> 2532.88
an unexpected mysterious death

2531.28 --> 2534.3190000000004
that then they might have all just

2532.88 --> 2535.839
called that spanish flu but if

2534.319 --> 2538.319
somebody's gonna have an accident they

2535.839 --> 2540.0
were not gonna ride it up

2538.319 --> 2542.079
like that or if somebody was already

2540.0 --> 2546.48
like under heavy surgery they'd

2542.079 --> 2548.8
i doubt it that they would

2546.48 --> 2550.2400000000002
do it just like what is happening right

2548.8 --> 2552.4
now with corona like

2550.24 --> 2554.16
what is happening with that currently is

2552.4 --> 2555.599
just unprecedented i don't think that's

2554.16 --> 2560.3999999999996
ever been done like that

2555.599 --> 2560.4
before so overt

2560.56 --> 2565.839
hey robin stanley

2576.839 --> 2579.839
um

2596.319 --> 2607.04
what oh my god

2599.76 --> 2611.6800000000003
that's just terrible

2607.04 --> 2611.68
oh you didn't know that zack this is

2611.92 --> 2620.16
yeah no it's it's not even

2615.68 --> 2622.48
it's not even that it's worse

2620.16 --> 2624.319
but if i told you that viruses don't

2622.48 --> 2626.4
exist they're actually a fictional

2624.319 --> 2629.599
construct

2626.4 --> 2632.7200000000003
and there's no scientific evidence

2629.599 --> 2635.44
that viruses work the way virus theory

2632.72 --> 2636.4199999999996
proclaims it does that's not how it

2635.44 --> 2637.68
actually works

2636.42 --> 2640.7200000000003
[Music]

2637.68 --> 2642.3999999999996
like all viruses like i'm not saying

2640.72 --> 2646.319
that bacteria don't work

2642.4 --> 2650.48
although i would adapt the original

2646.319 --> 2653.7599999999998
germ theory and basically try to

2650.48 --> 2656.88
complement it with terrain theory

2653.76 --> 2659.76
to get a better idea of how it all

2656.88 --> 2661.04
actually works because it's not just

2659.76 --> 2662.88
germ theory

2661.04 --> 2664.319
everything that's on top resting on top

2662.88 --> 2668.079
of that that's

2664.319 --> 2671.04
illogical if you exclude it of the

2668.079 --> 2673.3590000000004
terrain theory then it's illogical

2671.04 --> 2675.68
all right that's how i see it but

2673.359 --> 2679.839
viruses

2675.68 --> 2681.52
like sub bacterial microorganisms that

2679.839 --> 2683.44
invade the body even though they're

2681.52 --> 2686.72
technically not even

2683.44 --> 2689.52
living reproducible entities

2686.72 --> 2690.64
they're just inanimate yet that makes no

2689.52 --> 2694.319
damn sense

2690.64 --> 2694.319
this like none at all

2696.72 --> 2701.839
well more doctor lies the thing is is

2698.8 --> 2705.6800000000003
that most doctors

2701.839 --> 2708.64
probably don't understand

2705.68 --> 2710.3999999999996
it's not that straightforward it's not

2708.64 --> 2713.04
that well known

2710.4 --> 2715.52
like that's why there are virologists

2713.04 --> 2716.839
because it is like a complicated subject

2715.52 --> 2719.44
and you can't just

2716.839 --> 2721.2799999999997
quickly take a blood sample and then

2719.44 --> 2722.48
find a virus in that now it's much more

2721.28 --> 2724.88
complicated

2722.48 --> 2725.68
you know bacteria and all that and

2724.88 --> 2727.44
parasites

2725.68 --> 2729.2
yeah a doctor can just quickly take a

2727.44 --> 2732.88
blood sample take a a

2729.2 --> 2736.0
regular medical telescope and

2732.88 --> 2738.88
or what is it the microscope and check

2736.0 --> 2742.0
that out well with viruses no

2738.88 --> 2744.2400000000002
so yeah that's the issue

2742.0 --> 2745.359
so a lot of doctors are just taught like

2744.24 --> 2747.1189999999997
yeah viruses

2745.359 --> 2750.4
it's just in the medical program they

2747.119 --> 2750.4
don't know it's fake

2752.079 --> 2755.76
you see they don't know although yeah

2754.96 --> 2758.2400000000002
they

2755.76 --> 2761.8390000000004
should be able to figure it out once

2758.24 --> 2761.839
they start to inquire

2776.38 --> 2779.53
[Music]

2795.78 --> 2799.3990000000003
[Music]

2800.839 --> 2805.68
hmm

2802.48 --> 2810.319
well you see zak sterling

2805.68 --> 2814.24
technically i could for a moment

2810.319 --> 2818.319
go and assume presuppose that viruses

2814.24 --> 2819.9199999999996
actually exist and then really try to

2818.319 --> 2822.64
follow

2819.92 --> 2823.6800000000003
the descriptions of its understanding of

2822.64 --> 2827.44
how it's supposed to be

2823.68 --> 2829.9199999999996
right well if you go by that then none

2827.44 --> 2830.88
of what is happening out here the corona

2829.92 --> 2834.0
measures

2830.88 --> 2834.56
makes any damn sense if you presuppose

2834.0 --> 2837.599
that

2834.56 --> 2839.599
viruses are actually real then it makes

2837.599 --> 2843.6800000000003
no sense because

2839.599 --> 2846.1600000000003
from what is described it is

2843.68 --> 2848.72
nothing is gonna stop it like literally

2846.16 --> 2850.319
if that is real then nothing will stop

2848.72 --> 2852.72
it

2850.319 --> 2853.599
like no masks no social distance it's

2852.72 --> 2856.839
not gonna matter

2853.599 --> 2859.04
none of it it's going to spread very

2856.839 --> 2861.599
quickly

2859.04 --> 2862.319
from the factors that it possesses and

2861.599 --> 2864.1600000000003
it's they

2862.319 --> 2865.68
kind of already admitted and most people

2864.16 --> 2866.72
don't even notice they get it and all

2865.68 --> 2870.48
that so

2866.72 --> 2874.72
like you can't do anything about viruses

2870.48 --> 2878.079
except like totally for a very long time

2874.72 --> 2881.5989999999997
completely isolate things

2878.079 --> 2884.8
and that's just never worth it unless

2881.599 --> 2887.599
like it's already proven that

2884.8 --> 2888.7200000000003
with but the thing is it's not proven it

2887.599 --> 2889.92
doesn't happen but if

2888.72 --> 2892.0789999999997
it would happen and there would be a

2889.92 --> 2892.319
deadly virus yeah then quickly isolate

2892.079 --> 2894.319
it

2892.319 --> 2895.92
for a very long time and then when you

2894.319 --> 2898.16
come out again everybody's dead

2895.92 --> 2900.64
right well that doesn't actually happen

2898.16 --> 2903.1189999999997
it only happens in the movies

2900.64 --> 2903.1189999999997
you see

2905.2 --> 2910.7999999999997
but yeah that's why i also think that

2908.24 --> 2912.319
no matter how you look at it sweden did

2910.8 --> 2916.0
it the right way

2912.319 --> 2919.7599999999998
they actually presupposed

2916.0 --> 2921.76
viruses are real in the right manner

2919.76 --> 2924.6400000000003
and their response is the most logical

2921.76 --> 2924.6400000000003
from every angle

2924.72 --> 2928.5589999999997
just like no screw it there's nothing

2927.44 --> 2931.52
you can do against it

2928.559 --> 2933.0400000000004
better for to go for some kind of herd

2931.52 --> 2936.4
immunity which

2933.04 --> 2938.64
is kind of functional

2936.4 --> 2940.559
even from the germ theory perspective

2938.64 --> 2944.64
with regular bacteria so

2940.559 --> 2948.0
it makes sense even outside of

2944.64 --> 2951.52
the virus theory to do it like that

2948.0 --> 2955.359
in any situation see it's

2951.52 --> 2955.359
this stuff is all pretty complicated

2955.52 --> 2960.4
but yeah

2961.92 --> 2968.079
all these these silly

2965.04 --> 2971.119
lock downs and closing stores and

2968.079 --> 2971.599
masks that makes no damn sense none of

2971.119 --> 2974.1600000000003
it makes

2971.599 --> 2976.6400000000003
any damn sense vaccine completely

2974.16 --> 2979.68
ridiculous

2976.64 --> 2979.68
it is ridiculous

2982.559 --> 2987.76
like there is like if you presuppose

2986.079 --> 2990.319
viruses are real

2987.76 --> 2992.88
you can't vaccinate against it it's not

2990.319 --> 2992.88
possible

2996.0 --> 3001.2
it yeah unless you completely alter your

2998.64 --> 3002.64
physiology in some way that viruses can

3001.2 --> 3005.2799999999997
no longer

3002.64 --> 3006.5589999999997
yeah do what they are supposed to do

3005.28 --> 3008.7200000000003
right

3006.559 --> 3011.0400000000004
none of it makes any sense because

3008.72 --> 3013.7599999999998
viruses are even supposed to mutate very

3011.04 --> 3016.64
rapidly right

3013.76 --> 3017.0400000000004
like bacteria mutate well viruses are

3016.64 --> 3019.92
also

3017.04 --> 3021.04
supposed to mutate and then instantly

3019.92 --> 3023.6800000000003
spread everywhere again

3021.04 --> 3027.7599999999998
so it's completely useless even the

3023.68 --> 3029.7599999999998
notion of having a vaccine against it

3027.76 --> 3031.28
and that already kind of counted for

3029.76 --> 3034.3190000000004
things like the flu

3031.28 --> 3035.119
flu vaccines were always completely

3034.319 --> 3038.96
useless

3035.119 --> 3040.7200000000003
always and almost admittedly so

3038.96 --> 3042.48
because they every time they used the

3040.72 --> 3045.52
stream from last year

3042.48 --> 3046.8
yeah guess what 100 guarantee that

3045.52 --> 3049.28
whatever is going to be out there

3046.8 --> 3052.6400000000003
already mutated beyond

3049.28 --> 3054.88
like even presupposing it is all real

3052.64 --> 3055.7599999999998
it was already undone by their own

3054.88 --> 3059.119
concept

3055.76 --> 3062.48
see it's it's ridiculous it is

3059.119 --> 3062.48
really ridiculous

3065.76 --> 3072.079
i'm just saying even if you presuppose

3068.8 --> 3074.4
these things then still

3072.079 --> 3077.76
it's broken it reminds me of the ball

3074.4 --> 3081.52
that way you know even if you presuppose

3077.76 --> 3084.559
gravity is a force and that it can

3081.52 --> 3086.319
push against gas to keep it to a ball

3084.559 --> 3089.52
then it cannot oppose

3086.319 --> 3090.079
the actual proven gas pressure expansion

3089.52 --> 3092.8
power

3090.079 --> 3094.48
versus a vacuum see so even if you

3092.8 --> 3094.96
presuppose that all these things are

3094.48 --> 3098.88
real

3094.96 --> 3101.04
it doesn't work out very similar isn't

3098.88 --> 3101.04
it

3109.76 --> 3115.3590000000004
but i guess that's what they run on

3112.96 --> 3116.8
they just run on gullible people that'll

3115.359 --> 3119.359
take anything for granted

3116.8 --> 3121.599
not study up in it and basically trust

3119.359 --> 3125.359
things blindly

3121.599 --> 3128.2400000000002
because if you are more inquisitive

3125.359 --> 3128.96
and want to figure out something before

3128.24 --> 3132.319
you engage

3128.96 --> 3134.16
then the glaring problems will become

3132.319 --> 3136.64
apparent whether you

3134.16 --> 3139.839
are from a low tier or from a complete

3136.64 --> 3139.839
understanding what's going on

3144.16 --> 3151.359
so yeah these these things really to me

3147.68 --> 3155.68
seem to be out there just to

3151.359 --> 3159.2
basically destroy the stupid

3155.68 --> 3163.2
or the reckless the people that are not

3159.2 --> 3166.3999999999996
that are that would trust man

3163.2 --> 3168.24
as they say in the bible i think that

3166.4 --> 3171.839
trust man and not god not

3168.24 --> 3171.839
not figure out what the truth is

3172.0 --> 3184.4
just go with what is said on an impulse

3181.2 --> 3184.3999999999996
insane and malicious

3184.8 --> 3190.0
oh yeah i get that i get that sensation

3187.44 --> 3190.0
definitely

3193.119 --> 3198.48
but yeah to me it only really becomes

3196.079 --> 3198.96
actually insane and malicious when it is

3198.48 --> 3200.88
being

3198.96 --> 3202.8
forced on people when you don't have a

3200.88 --> 3204.559
choice

3202.8 --> 3206.319
then it becomes really insane and

3204.559 --> 3209.119
malicious then it becomes just a

3206.319 --> 3211.2799999999997
straight out attack

3209.119 --> 3213.6800000000003
because as long as you have the option

3211.28 --> 3216.559
not to

3213.68 --> 3217.2799999999997
it's extremely unpleasant it's dark but

3216.559 --> 3219.76
yeah

3217.28 --> 3219.76
at least

3220.64 --> 3225.2799999999997
the wiser will get out of it you see

3226.559 --> 3230.079
but if nobody has a choice yet then it's

3228.64 --> 3233.1189999999997
just an assault weapon

3230.079 --> 3235.119
it's just a covert weapon and that yeah

3233.119 --> 3236.559
and it would be used to attack people if

3235.119 --> 3238.88
it was mandated it was

3236.559 --> 3240.4
not just set to be mandated but actually

3238.88 --> 3242.88
mandated

3240.4 --> 3244.64
not like oh you can't have your job or

3242.88 --> 3246.2400000000002
you can't have this but

3244.64 --> 3248.7999999999997
because that's not actually mandating

3246.24 --> 3250.16
that's still corporate policy type thing

3248.8 --> 3252.319
if they would actually come to your

3250.16 --> 3254.16
front door and like yeah you must take

3252.319 --> 3256.64
it we are coming in your house and you

3254.16 --> 3258.24
are going to take it that

3256.64 --> 3260.72
that would be just a straight out

3258.24 --> 3260.72
assault

3261.28 --> 3266.96
that and that's yeah

3264.48 --> 3269.28
that is extremely evil but that's not

3266.96 --> 3269.28
happen

3269.599 --> 3273.599
it mostly all seems to be bluff and

3272.559 --> 3275.3590000000004
taking away

3273.599 --> 3277.3590000000004
your trinkets taking away the

3275.359 --> 3280.799
conveniences

3277.359 --> 3282.96
of what society had to offer to try and

3280.799 --> 3284.559
make you push to go over that line to

3282.96 --> 3287.839
take it just

3284.559 --> 3287.8390000000004
to be able to continue

3288.72 --> 3293.839
that seems to be the main trick

3318.839 --> 3321.839
so

3328.4 --> 3335.839
must be severely acidified to get sick

3336.96 --> 3341.119
alkaline body will not get sick well

3342.079 --> 3348.2400000000002
yeah although i wouldn't directly put a

3345.28 --> 3350.559
causal relation onto that but

3348.24 --> 3351.52
yeah sometimes your body just also needs

3350.559 --> 3354.7200000000003
to get sick

3351.52 --> 3358.079
because getting sick actually cleans you

3354.72 --> 3360.3999999999996
up i experienced this firsthand when i

3358.079 --> 3363.8390000000004
got really sick

3360.4 --> 3363.839
over a month ago

3365.359 --> 3369.7599999999998
or i should say in november that might

3368.559 --> 3372.4
be easier to just say

3369.76 --> 3373.0400000000004
in november i got really sick well after

3372.4 --> 3376.88
that

3373.04 --> 3380.96
i was cleaned up enormously

3376.88 --> 3382.96
so sickness is not just like oh

3380.96 --> 3385.04
we are being attacked it's also like

3382.96 --> 3387.28
okay it's time to clean up

3385.04 --> 3391.839
some stuff that's been laying around for

3387.28 --> 3391.8390000000004
a while

3396.799 --> 3400.96
that's it's funny because now actually

3399.04 --> 3403.599
how i see it is that

3400.96 --> 3404.7200000000003
getting really sick is in a way actually

3403.599 --> 3408.4
a blessing

3404.72 --> 3410.48
now only because

3408.4 --> 3411.599
afterwards it's almost a guarantee that

3410.48 --> 3414.48
i'll feel

3411.599 --> 3415.28
much better than i did before i became

3414.48 --> 3417.2
sick

3415.28 --> 3420.3190000000004
and when you realize that then it shines

3417.2 --> 3420.319
a whole new light on it

3421.839 --> 3425.2
if you actually take the time to just

3424.0 --> 3427.359
seek it out and not just

3425.2 --> 3428.5589999999997
oh but i have to do this i have to do

3427.359 --> 3431.04
that i can't be

3428.559 --> 3432.2400000000002
sick right now that's the worst response

3431.04 --> 3434.88
ever when you say

3432.24 --> 3436.4799999999996
oh i can't afford to be sick i just have

3434.88 --> 3437.6800000000003
to act like i'm not sick and i'm going

3436.48 --> 3440.0
to continue what i do

3437.68 --> 3441.68
yeah that is absolutely screwing with

3440.0 --> 3445.76
your body

3441.68 --> 3447.5989999999997
always ends up bad side effects

3445.76 --> 3448.7990000000004
every time you see it every time it

3447.599 --> 3451.839
happens

3448.799 --> 3453.92
when you get sick like really sick you

3451.839 --> 3456.5589999999997
just have to stick it out you can't just

3453.92 --> 3458.0
act like it's not happening

3456.559 --> 3460.48
does it mean that oh if you get the

3458.0 --> 3463.359
sniffles or something that's nothing

3460.48 --> 3464.0
sniffles yeah everybody gets a bit

3463.359 --> 3466.72
sniffy

3464.0 --> 3468.0
every now and then that that's minor

3466.72 --> 3470.319
nuisance

3468.0 --> 3471.52
unless you like get really that yeah if

3470.319 --> 3475.839
you get a headache and all that of

3471.52 --> 3475.839
course because it's disruptive

3476.079 --> 3479.52
and hey some people even just go through

3478.16 --> 3483.04
that

3479.52 --> 3488.64
all right hey guns are never on rmp

3483.04 --> 3491.68
good to see you

3488.64 --> 3494.24
keeping you same i think you mean sane

3491.68 --> 3494.24
probably but

3494.799 --> 3500.079
glad to hear it doing my best

3505.38 --> 3509.119
[Music]

3507.2 --> 3516.799
that crisis healing it hurts to heal

3509.119 --> 3519.52
yeah well it usually does

3516.799 --> 3523.599
when i got sick in november it was

3519.52 --> 3523.599
extremely painful and even scary

3526.4 --> 3530.079
because it just got so bad and like when

3529.2 --> 3532.799
it gets that bad

3530.079 --> 3533.52
you can't even sleep you're like your

3532.799 --> 3536.96
body just

3533.52 --> 3538.559
forces you to yeah you just can't

3536.96 --> 3540.64
get to that point and then you have to

3538.559 --> 3541.8390000000004
get really complicated with your mind to

3540.64 --> 3545.44
even attempt it

3541.839 --> 3548.24
to basically trick your body temporarily

3545.44 --> 3550.0
to be able to sleep for a short moment

3548.24 --> 3551.52
and i had that for like three days it

3550.0 --> 3558.16
was terrible

3551.52 --> 3560.079
never had it that bad for that long

3558.16 --> 3562.8799999999997
especially in the evenings it got really

3560.079 --> 3562.88
bad every time

3567.31 --> 3571.2
[Music]

3569.599 --> 3573.839
but when you go through that sort of

3571.2 --> 3573.839
duress

3577.52 --> 3582.24
then afterward it's there's like a

3580.0 --> 3583.76
reward it does like the challenge i

3582.24 --> 3587.839
guess or

3583.76 --> 3592.559
just in a way it snaps you out of things

3587.839 --> 3592.5589999999997
like it just clears things up

3598.839 --> 3601.839
anyway

3602.64 --> 3605.92
sticking star wars

3606.079 --> 3611.3590000000004
they will not know physical

3607.68 --> 3614.72
relationships i don't know about that

3611.359 --> 3617.839
not sure there will obviously be

3614.72 --> 3617.839
children that will be

3618.48 --> 3622.319
indoctrinated by the [ __ ] and they

3620.48 --> 3623.359
will try to act it out but that doesn't

3622.319 --> 3626.72
mean it's

3623.359 --> 3628.48
really gonna last forever it only lasts

3626.72 --> 3632.0
as long as the conditioning

3628.48 --> 3635.68
is being reinforced from the outside

3632.0 --> 3639.599
so if it would stop

3635.68 --> 3642.72
then they may be like what

3639.599 --> 3644.559
we don't have to do this anymore and

3642.72 --> 3646.72
they might be a little uncertain at

3644.559 --> 3649.44
first

3646.72 --> 3650.0789999999997
with connecting i don't know it depends

3649.44 --> 3652.0
on how

3650.079 --> 3653.8390000000004
rigorously they are treated like that if

3652.0 --> 3655.839
even

3653.839 --> 3657.599
they're like forced to socially distance

3655.839 --> 3658.96
and wear masks with their parents and

3657.599 --> 3659.6800000000003
all that and their parents are like oh

3658.96 --> 3664.2400000000002
don't touch me

3659.68 --> 3664.24
covet yeah that's absolutely disastrous

3665.359 --> 3672.16
but yeah you'd have to be totally insane

3668.72 --> 3672.16
as a parent to go that far

3672.64 --> 3685.839
like really badly insane

3688.49 --> 3691.5899999999997
[Music]

3698.48 --> 3701.599
wearing mask is mess up yeah it's not

3700.319 --> 3705.359
good

3701.599 --> 3706.96
like i i notice it too it's just not

3705.359 --> 3710.72
good for your

3706.96 --> 3713.68
for your respiratory system at all

3710.72 --> 3715.839
so i even draw the correlation with the

3713.68 --> 3718.319
asian countries where it's very popular

3715.839 --> 3720.0
to wear masks because of the typical

3718.319 --> 3722.0
respiratory diseases

3720.0 --> 3723.68
and then i'm thinking oh right so

3722.0 --> 3725.68
they're wearing all these masks

3723.68 --> 3727.44
a lot of people because of respiratory

3725.68 --> 3728.799
diseases could it be that the masks are

3727.44 --> 3730.319
actually causing the respiratory

3728.799 --> 3732.88
diseases

3730.319 --> 3732.88
partially

3733.52 --> 3740.88
maybe unless they wear it

3736.799 --> 3742.48
as like protection against pollution

3740.88 --> 3745.2000000000003
like if there's a lot of air pollution

3742.48 --> 3748.319
then yeah then it might be

3745.2 --> 3751.2799999999997
i guess sensible certain degree to wear

3748.319 --> 3751.2799999999997
mask i don't know

3752.16 --> 3768.06
just passing through no no ah

3755.359 --> 3772.119
yes yes

3768.06 --> 3772.119
[Music]

3790.319 --> 3792.72
all right

3794.48 --> 3801.68
what did he say he said no so you

3798.0 --> 3803.52
person that has not come in here before

3801.68 --> 3805.0389999999998
thought it was necessarily just to pop

3803.52 --> 3808.079
in to say no

3805.039 --> 3811.599
when i basically propose yeah

3808.079 --> 3814.96
said thing about wearing the masks

3811.599 --> 3817.119
that they might actually be causing

3814.96 --> 3819.039
increase in respiratory problems and he

3817.119 --> 3819.76
just thought it was very necessary to to

3819.039 --> 3821.76
get in here

3819.76 --> 3822.7990000000004
first time and just say no so i just

3821.76 --> 3826.079
already know oh

3822.799 --> 3831.2
medical squirter yeah

3826.079 --> 3831.2000000000003
wants to believe well

3831.68 --> 3834.72
i don't really care about that and

3834.0 --> 3837.039
people

3834.72 --> 3838.0
that find it necessary to reinforce

3837.039 --> 3840.4
their conditioning

3838.0 --> 3840.4
in here

3845.839 --> 3849.2
expelled breath yes

3884.96 --> 3895.839
okay i didn't know that george sanford

3896.24 --> 3900.5589999999997
although i think that in textile

3898.16 --> 3903.839
factories there's a lot of more

3900.559 --> 3908.079
more yeah dust

3903.839 --> 3910.319
fibers flying around you know

3908.079 --> 3912.6400000000003
compared to where breathing through a

3910.319 --> 3912.64
mask

i haven't actually watched it every time

3938.4 --> 3943.359
all these

3939.52 --> 3943.359
government people trying to

3946.799 --> 3951.92
do these stupid things with corona

3950.0 --> 3953.76
like oh yeah you can't have any

3951.92 --> 3955.52

3958.64 --> 3963.0389999999998
negative like everyone is just gonna

3962.0 --> 3966.559
hate them

3966.559 --> 3970.3190000000004
would approve of that sort of thing

3968.799 --> 3973.52
nobody

3970.319 --> 3975.68
like people might abide by the corona

3973.52 --> 3977.2
rules are just like oh we have to do it

3975.68 --> 3981.68
but nobody's going to

3977.2 --> 3981.68
appreciate that nobody

anyway i don't know if what the exact

3990.079 --> 3994.079

4050.64 --> 4055.359
that's disgusting but predictable

4055.52 --> 4060.24
it's very predictable it's not the first

4058.72 --> 4064.319
time i've seen

4060.24 --> 4066.0
things like that happen

4064.319 --> 4070.16
like even in the netherlands with

4066.0 --> 4070.16
sinterklaas they do that sort of thing

4070.88 --> 4075.119
i don't know if they did it this year i

4072.559 --> 4077.8390000000004
haven't really paid attention to

4075.119 --> 4077.839
like the media

4079.839 --> 4091.839
so that center class completely passed

4082.319 --> 4091.839
me by this year

4102.839 --> 4105.839
god

is that

4170.0 --> 4174.4
like seriously what the hell is that is

4172.96 --> 4176.08
that supposed to be some kind of

4174.4 --> 4189.839
sarcastic joke

4176.08 --> 4189.839
i don't get it john watson

why

4223.199 --> 4231.839999999999

[Music]

4284.4 --> 4288.32
what's going on here what do you got

4287.52 --> 4301.84
against

4288.32 --> 4301.84
soup kitchens the [ __ ] is this

4309.92 --> 4313.12
free yeah but it's there's not infinite

4312.239 --> 4316.4
of that

4313.12 --> 4319.76
it's ridiculous like soup kitchens

4316.4 --> 4323.679
are for people that are gonna starve

4319.76 --> 4327.1990000000005
otherwise people that

4323.679 --> 4329.76
i don't know whatever

4327.199 --> 4331.759999999999
it's not like oh free food for everybody

4329.76 --> 4334.8
nobody has to cook anymore that's not

4331.76 --> 4334.8
what that is at all

4340.719 --> 4344.4800000000005
yeah i find it's kind of ridiculous

4345.92 --> 4350.56
like soup kitchens doesn't mean

4348.56 --> 4353.04
socialism

4350.56 --> 4354.400000000001
it's not like oh that means everybody's

4353.04 --> 4357.28
going to be encouraged

4354.4 --> 4358.96
not to make their own food anymore no

4357.28 --> 4362.639999999999
that's ridiculous

4358.96 --> 4365.84
like that's not even achievable

4362.64 --> 4367.76
literally it's not achievable like

4365.84 --> 4370.0
they can't even do that even if they

4367.76 --> 4372.400000000001
wanted to it's to mess up really

4370.0 --> 4372.4
quickly

4390.88 --> 4399.84
i don't like your tone john watson

4411.679 --> 4417.1990000000005
yeah well perfection if that is what he

4413.44 --> 4417.199
means that's absolutely ridiculous

4418.88 --> 4424.4800000000005
to say that oh because evil people

4422.159 --> 4426.0
soup kitchens it's the dumbest causal

4424.48 --> 4429.28
relation suggestion i've

4426.0 --> 4429.6
heard in a while like what the [ __ ] has

4429.28 --> 4432.4
that

4429.6 --> 4432.400000000001
have to do with it

4437.76 --> 4442.4800000000005
i don't get it i don't get it

4444.32 --> 4446.719
sure

4447.679 --> 4452.32
sure i don't get it because if there

4450.0 --> 4454.32
were no evil people that means that

4452.32 --> 4455.44
everybody will just start behaving

4454.32 --> 4458.5599999999995
perfectly

4455.44 --> 4460.5599999999995
everybody will all just nobody's going

4458.56 --> 4462.4800000000005
to need the soup kitchens anymore ever

4460.56 --> 4463.120000000001
because suddenly everybody knows how to

4462.48 --> 4465.919999999999
cook

4463.12 --> 4467.36
everybody will be responsible yeah

4465.92 --> 4471.679
that's how it works right

4467.36 --> 4471.679
no it's ridiculous

4475.44 --> 4479.839999999999
because they love poor people yeah sure

4480.84 --> 4483.84
no

4497.6 --> 4504.64
you're being really ridiculous right now

4501.04 --> 4507.12
like really ridiculous this is stupid

4504.64 --> 4508.08
to suggest that because evil people out

4507.12 --> 4510.0
there

4508.08 --> 4511.28
and then tricks that they can

4510.0 --> 4513.52
potentially use

4511.28 --> 4515.36
to aggravate things that it

4513.52 --> 4517.52
automatically implies that if you have

4515.36 --> 4518.159
soup kitchens which have been abused in

4517.52 --> 4520.159000000001
certain

4518.159 --> 4521.679
social engineering settings that it

4520.159 --> 4523.36
automatically means that every soup

4521.679 --> 4525.92
kitchen is evil that's the most

4523.36 --> 4527.36
[ __ ] conspiracy theory i've ever

4525.92 --> 4530.64
heard

4527.36 --> 4533.679
at this point it's really dumb

4530.64 --> 4536.400000000001
really cervany level dumb

4533.679 --> 4538.159
can't be serious like oh ban all soup

4536.4 --> 4540.0
kitchens because if you have a soup

4538.159 --> 4540.5599999999995
kitchen that means that evil people are

4540.0 --> 4543.76
in control

4540.56 --> 4546.0
are you listening to yourself man the

4543.76 --> 4546.0
[ __ ]

4549.92 --> 4553.12
i wouldn't call them a fruitcake for

4551.6 --> 4555.04
that but it's

4553.12 --> 4556.88
you know that's not what nobody said

4555.04 --> 4557.36
well why don't you read back what you

4556.88 --> 4567.84
said

4557.36 --> 4567.839999999999

[Music]

4582.8 --> 4585.92
government propaganda spin on the issues

4621.92 --> 4627.36
[ __ ] soup kitchens are evil what the

4624.48 --> 4627.36
[ __ ] wrong with you

4629.679 --> 4634.8
because yeah soup kitchens if there's a

4632.64 --> 4636.8
soup kitchen in the city people well

4634.8 --> 4639.28
according to john watson that means that

4636.8 --> 4641.28
evil people are in control because if

4639.28 --> 4643.44
evil people were not in control there

4641.28 --> 4647.92
would be no soup kitchens

4643.44 --> 4651.839999999999
yes makes a lot of sense when you don't

4647.92 --> 4651.84
think about it

4655.84 --> 4668.159000000001
they shouldn't be needed

4665.6 --> 4669.679
yeah well it's just like oh yeah like

4668.159 --> 4672.5599999999995
well technically guns

4669.679 --> 4674.56
shouldn't be needed either right but

4672.56 --> 4677.84
they are

4674.56 --> 4679.679
in ways so yeah a lot of things should

4677.84 --> 4682.56
not be needed but guess what they are

4679.679 --> 4683.1990000000005
because there's always going to be

4682.56 --> 4686.719
people

4683.199 --> 4690.0
that are not going to be able to

4686.719 --> 4692.32
adapt and figure it all out even if they

4690.0 --> 4695.36
had the true freedom

4692.32 --> 4700.639999999999
because people choose not to

4695.36 --> 4700.639999999999
so it's ridiculous the whole premise is

4704.84 --> 4707.84
ridiculous

4721.28 --> 4724.96
all right now of course soup kitchens as

4723.84 --> 4728.400000000001
a scenario

4724.96 --> 4730.88
can be abused right that's possible

4728.4 --> 4732.5599999999995
they could get as bad as like oh a soup

4730.88 --> 4734.159000000001
kitchen oh it's very nice

4732.56 --> 4736.719
you're gonna have to take a vaccine

4734.159 --> 4738.96
though yeah that's totally [ __ ]

4736.719 --> 4740.64
and that's absolutely horrific if they

4738.96 --> 4744.32
did anything like that

4740.64 --> 4749.84
but just soup kitchens no

4744.32 --> 4749.84
no that's preposterous

4758.0 --> 4763.84
right exactly robin stanley

4774.88 --> 4777.84
hmm

4779.0 --> 4782.149
[Music]

4784.15 --> 4787.5199999999995
[Music]

4785.28 --> 4787.5199999999995
uh

4789.52 --> 4805.84
i don't know my god i don't really care

4806.719 --> 4809.92
i don't know if he is

4813.92 --> 4819.12
i think he probably has connected to a

4816.88 --> 4822.4800000000005
couple of dubious people

4819.12 --> 4825.679
that doesn't mean he is one of them like

4822.48 --> 4833.839999999999
literally one of them one of them

4825.679 --> 4833.84
that's not necessarily the case

4848.08 --> 4861.84
hey adam meekin

4872.84 --> 4878.32
hmm

4875.84 --> 4878.32
all right

4879.04 --> 4882.719
oh guns have never run rmp let's

4883.44 --> 4891.12
yeah i understand what you mean

4888.96 --> 4892.8
although i don't know i personally don't

4891.12 --> 4894.639
really feel that way

4892.8 --> 4896.88
but i could totally get it it's just

4894.639 --> 4896.88
that

4898.639 --> 4902.4800000000005
i really look at them more as just

4900.84 --> 4905.76
cursed

4902.48 --> 4907.36
so it's like i don't even want to like

4905.76 --> 4909.04
at this point attack them anymore

4907.36 --> 4912.719
because that would just make

4909.04 --> 4915.04
their creepiness rub off on me

4912.719 --> 4916.2390000000005
so i try to basically not let it become

4915.04 --> 4918.56
personal because it's

4916.239 --> 4920.48
that's what they want at this point in

4918.56 --> 4924.88
on a certain level they want you to

4920.48 --> 4924.879999999999
engage them even if it is negatively

4925.04 --> 4928.08
because these people are all hollowed

4926.719 --> 4930.719
out

4928.08 --> 4933.6
they barely have any normal human senses

4930.719 --> 4933.6
left some of them

4934.56 --> 4940.320000000001
so they experience things

4938.08 --> 4941.28
through other people almost it's i don't

4940.32 --> 4945.84
know it's

4941.28 --> 4945.84
it's tough to explain

4946.32 --> 4953.04
so yeah i just i go by the standard like

4949.84 --> 4955.04
or i try to because it's very difficult

4953.04 --> 4956.719
sometimes i do get pulled into just like

4955.04 --> 4959.44
one tick tick

4956.719 --> 4961.92
get rid of them right now you've all

4959.44 --> 4961.919999999999
witnessed

4963.6 --> 4968.400000000001
but on average i just when i'm calm i

4966.239 --> 4969.28
just regard them as like okay they're

4968.4 --> 4972.5599999999995
literally just

4969.28 --> 4974.48
going down the drain slowly but they

4972.56 --> 4976.8
have only one way to go and that's down

4974.48 --> 4987.12
so how quickly are they gonna go down

4976.8 --> 4989.4400000000005
i try not to interfere

4987.12 --> 4992.239
just some turrets are just really hard

4989.44 --> 4994.638999999999
to flush but eventually they do flush

4992.239 --> 4994.638999999999
you see

4996.48 --> 5001.839999999999
don't want to get all up and close

5006.96 --> 5015.84
our public libraries like soup kitchens

5010.48 --> 5015.839999999999
now there were soup kitchens

5033.679 --> 5043.84
ah not even gonna get a chuckle from

5035.52 --> 5043.84
that oh well

5058.03 --> 5061.21
[Music]

5066.06 --> 5070.990000000001
[Music]

5068.84 --> 5074.12
wow

5070.99 --> 5074.12
[Music]

5092.239 --> 5098.0
well iron fe i think that kind of

5095.28 --> 5101.84
depends on

5098.0 --> 5101.84
which library where in the us

5105.36 --> 5109.44
maybe the big city libraries are like

5110.84 --> 5113.84
that

5138.84 --> 5141.84
so

5152.84 --> 5158.159000000001
so

5155.44 --> 5161.28
yeah mind of god that's a very tricky

5158.159 --> 5161.28
existential question

5161.92 --> 5169.8
if you get down to the nitty-gritty i'd

5163.76 --> 5172.909000000001
say a hundred percent

5169.8 --> 5172.909000000001
[Music]

5175.12 --> 5182.0
but yeah is it is the writer

5178.719 --> 5185.52
aware that they believe some sort

5182.0 --> 5188.08
of lie that's not guaranteed

5185.52 --> 5190.2390000000005
so what do you exactly mean books by

5188.08 --> 5191.12
lies it depends on the writer did the

5190.239 --> 5193.5199999999995
writer know

5191.12 --> 5195.199
he was writing down a lie or did he

5193.52 --> 5198.56
simply believe

5195.199 --> 5198.5599999999995
and then what is left

5199.04 --> 5203.6
are the books you think are lies are

5201.52 --> 5211.84
they actually lies or were they just

5203.6 --> 5211.84
belief you see

5217.84 --> 5222.159000000001
is it a lie if you simply don't know the

5222.84 --> 5228.56
truth

5225.52 --> 5232.96
objective lies well there is something

5228.56 --> 5236.159000000001
that doesn't exist objective lies

5232.96 --> 5238.56
lying is subjective because

5236.159 --> 5242.0
information are not truth or lies they

5238.56 --> 5244.639
are only truth or lies in relation to

5242.0 --> 5244.639
the person

5248.48 --> 5252.718999999999
subjective lies objectively that's very

5251.36 --> 5256.5599999999995
weird

5252.719 --> 5256.56
lying is an act it's not

5256.719 --> 5264.0
yeah it doesn't make any sense like that

5260.639 --> 5264.0
god determined lie

5264.159 --> 5269.839999999999
lying is an act

5267.76 --> 5272.56
is an action and has to do with the

5269.84 --> 5272.56
consciousness

5273.28 --> 5276.96
if something is incorrect that doesn't

5275.679 --> 5280.159
make it a lie

5276.96 --> 5283.92
it only becomes a lie when the person is

5280.159 --> 5286.4
aware that it's incorrect you see so

5283.92 --> 5287.6
lying specifically is subjective because

5286.4 --> 5289.5199999999995
it has to do with

5287.6 --> 5291.280000000001
the act of the person and their

5289.52 --> 5292.8
awareness of the information that

5291.28 --> 5308.32
they're putting out

5292.8 --> 5310.56
that's what makes things a lie

5308.32 --> 5310.5599999999995
good

5320.84 --> 5324.88
huh

5322.4 --> 5328.239
same number as incorrect statistics

5324.88 --> 5330.08
ninety three point five percent wow

5328.239 --> 5336.159
that's a lot of incorrect statistics

5330.08 --> 5339.679
adam can

5336.159 --> 5339.679
was carl sagan a liar

5339.76 --> 5346.0
probably yes he probably did know

5346.719 --> 5352.639
he was probably a spin doctor and spin

5349.44 --> 5354.879999999999
doctors are getting creative

5352.639 --> 5357.28
with what they are putting out as the

5354.88 --> 5357.28
truth

5359.92 --> 5365.84
when they know it's probably not real

5369.44 --> 5372.638999999999
now i don't know carl sagan but i've

5371.92 --> 5375.28
heard him

5372.639 --> 5377.36
say things have a certain frequency a

5375.28 --> 5379.44
certain energy over him when he's

5377.36 --> 5381.36
on camera and when he was that it makes

5379.44 --> 5384.5599999999995
me say yeah carl sagan is

5381.36 --> 5387.5199999999995
very likely an overt liar like he he

5384.56 --> 5393.84
probably knew because of the way he

5387.52 --> 5393.84
composed himself

5404.84 --> 5407.84
so

5414.96 --> 5421.84
the ndt

5418.08 --> 5421.84
what's an ndt

5428.48 --> 5435.839999999999
oh neil degrasse dies all right right

5430.719 --> 5435.84
yeah he was

5440.56 --> 5445.360000000001
right he was the spin doctor he's the

5442.4 --> 5447.599999999999
one that has to keep the ball spinning

5445.36 --> 5448.88
and then other people will be inspired

5447.6 --> 5451.360000000001
and be like

5448.88 --> 5453.04
i can talk about the universe and how

5451.36 --> 5456.48
it's supposed to be much better and then

5453.04 --> 5459.199
they write all their stuff

5456.48 --> 5461.36
so it's just one person that knowingly

5459.199 --> 5462.08
keeps the ball lie spinning and then

5461.36 --> 5464.48
everybody

5462.08 --> 5467.199
just starts to work with that they all

5464.48 --> 5469.28
start to make their move in response

5467.199 --> 5471.12
even though they don't realize

5469.28 --> 5472.4
potentially that it's not true or some

5471.12 --> 5474.639
of them do

5472.4 --> 5476.5599999999995
but it just keeps it going it also keeps

5474.639 --> 5477.92
the people that

5476.56 --> 5480.96
don't know it's not real and that

5477.92 --> 5484.8
believe it it makes them make their move

5480.96 --> 5487.36
you see that's part of the trick

5484.8 --> 5488.88
just need one liar out there and plenty

5487.36 --> 5491.12
of media coverage

5488.88 --> 5492.32
and then people that don't know it's a

5491.12 --> 5495.199
lie

5492.32 --> 5505.84
that believe it will make their moves

5495.199 --> 5505.839999999999
they will do their thing because of that

5508.0 --> 5513.76
it's how i remember that it worked with

5509.92 --> 5513.76
me when i didn't know

5514.159 --> 5518.0
like those people would always be

5515.92 --> 5520.8
exactly like i said i would be like ah

5518.0 --> 5522.56
i can i can explain that much more

5520.8 --> 5525.6
inspiring much better he's

5522.56 --> 5528.159000000001
wrong about this it would like

5525.6 --> 5529.360000000001
set me on fire and i'm like i'm gonna do

5528.159 --> 5533.839999999999
something with this

5529.36 --> 5533.839999999999
right now it's what it did

5553.28 --> 5561.84
the ala banned book list what

5557.92 --> 5561.84
what what is that

5575.36 --> 5579.44
oh god ligo gravitational wave

5590.8 --> 5603.84
yeah don't ask me that question because

5593.04 --> 5603.84
it's not gonna happen

5607.199 --> 5613.04
yeah minor god please just and don't

5611.12 --> 5614.719
just don't talk like that i do not

5613.04 --> 5616.239
appreciate it

5614.719 --> 5618.2390000000005
there's not going to be a forced

5616.239 --> 5620.32
vaccination and i doubt it's going to be

5618.239 --> 5623.678999999999
anywhere because if there will be

5620.32 --> 5625.12
it's going to be civil war

5623.679 --> 5626.96
and there's like a lot of people going

5625.12 --> 5629.28
to die and a lot of people that are just

5626.96 --> 5631.36
going to break

5629.28 --> 5633.36
that are literally just going to go out

5631.36 --> 5634.54
and punish the people that are

5633.36 --> 5637.589999999999
driving this

5634.54 --> 5637.59
[Music]

5638.719 --> 5642.2390000000005
so i don't think they will ever they

5640.719 --> 5645.199
will they will try to

5642.239 --> 5645.759999999999
mind control the [ __ ] out of everyone

5645.199 --> 5647.919999999999
maybe

5645.76 --> 5649.84
all day long just say it's mandated it's

5647.92 --> 5651.12
mandated it's mandated it's mandated you

5649.84 --> 5652.2390000000005
have to take it now you have to take an

5651.12 --> 5655.599999999999
hour you'll be arrested

5652.239 --> 5656.638999999999
and they'll say that maybe even every

5655.6 --> 5659.04
freaking day

5656.639 --> 5659.679
maybe even in the advertisements that

5659.04 --> 5663.199
bad

5659.679 --> 5664.4800000000005
but they can't actually do it they can

5663.199 --> 5667.759999999999
only drive you

5664.48 --> 5673.839999999999
nuts until you do it that's what i think

5667.76 --> 5673.84
is going on

5675.84 --> 5682.8
because the consequences are

5679.4 --> 5686.159
uncontrollable if they actually

5682.8 --> 5686.88
force it into people they can't deal

5686.159 --> 5688.879999999999
with that

5686.88 --> 5690.8
they'll try to manipulate everyone in

5688.88 --> 5694.2390000000005
every way they can

5690.8 --> 5695.6
try to make them take it but they can't

5694.239 --> 5699.919999999999
actually force it because the

5695.6 --> 5700.96
consequences would be uncontrollable

5699.92 --> 5704.8
people that have been

5700.96 --> 5704.8
holding on holding back

5704.88 --> 5708.639
for a very long time maybe their entire

5707.52 --> 5711.119000000001
lives

5708.639 --> 5713.119
and there's still plenty of those around

5711.119 --> 5715.119
that have basically built up grudges

5713.119 --> 5716.5599999999995
they will just see it for what it is and

5715.119 --> 5719.199
it's like yeah now

5716.56 --> 5720.2390000000005
the nazis have come and they will

5719.199 --> 5722.239
literally

5720.239 --> 5729.839999999999
in their ranks just stand up and take

5722.239 --> 5733.599999999999
care of business

5729.84 --> 5738.32
so they can't do that the consequences

5733.6 --> 5738.320000000001
are out of control if they would

5739.28 --> 5745.679
it would be war one way or the other

5743.36 --> 5746.48
war on the people and then maybe civil

5745.679 --> 5750.0
war and

5746.48 --> 5750.0
just giant chaos

5751.04 --> 5754.719
and yeah everything's going to break

5752.639 --> 5755.6
down so all the people that are part of

5754.719 --> 5757.84
this that are

5755.6 --> 5759.280000000001
invested in this control they will lose

5757.84 --> 5761.119000000001
their control

5759.28 --> 5762.8
all their schemes will fall apart so

5761.119 --> 5765.28
they can't do it

5762.8 --> 5766.639
they can't actually do it they can only

5765.28 --> 5768.639
try to mind control

5766.639 --> 5770.159000000001
everybody into believing that they can

5768.639 --> 5772.2390000000005
do it and that they will do it

5770.159 --> 5773.599999999999
and that you must comply quickly before

5772.239 --> 5775.44
you get executed

5773.6 --> 5776.88
doesn't mean that they are actually able

5775.44 --> 5780.719
to do that

5776.88 --> 5783.52
you see they're just gonna drive

5780.719 --> 5799.84
try to drive you insane they've already

5783.52 --> 5799.84
been working on that for a while now

5803.04 --> 5807.28
yeah well that's it tara but that's not

5806.32 --> 5810.159
mandatory

5807.28 --> 5811.599999999999
that's simply saying oh you want to do

5810.159 --> 5813.5199999999995
something

5811.6 --> 5815.119000000001
something societal you want to be able

5813.52 --> 5816.56
to travel through an airplane oh you

5815.119 --> 5820.48
want to

5816.56 --> 5823.92
have a good job you want to

5820.48 --> 5826.0
i don't know go out to festivals yeah

5823.92 --> 5827.679
then that way they'll force it on he's

5826.0 --> 5829.84
like oh you want to be a part of

5827.679 --> 5831.84
the society that you got used to was

5829.84 --> 5832.4800000000005
just out there for everybody to take

5831.84 --> 5835.04
right

5832.48 --> 5836.718999999999
yeah then you'll you have to die to do

5835.04 --> 5837.5199999999995
that like you have to basically take

5836.719 --> 5840.2390000000005
something

5837.52 --> 5840.88
that's going to kill you yeah that that

5840.239 --> 5843.759999999999
they'll do

5840.88 --> 5844.88
yeah it's going to be oh oh you wanted

5843.76 --> 5847.76
society

5844.88 --> 5848.56
you thought it was all free no you want

5847.76 --> 5851.119000000001
it back

5848.56 --> 5851.76
you can't handle not having that anymore

5851.119 --> 5856.239
well

5851.76 --> 5860.719
die then then maintain it

5856.239 --> 5860.718999999999
yeah that they will do

5865.44 --> 5869.5199999999995
and because of that i'm very glad that i

5868.32 --> 5872.799999999999
have not

5869.52 --> 5872.8
integrated so much

5873.44 --> 5878.719
that i don't have that much to lose at

5876.08 --> 5878.719
this point

5879.28 --> 5883.28
except yeah i'm still dependent on

5882.239 --> 5886.159
supermarkets

5883.28 --> 5886.719
and all that and that's problematic

5886.159 --> 5888.239
because

5886.719 --> 5890.56
well on the other hand like yeah it

5888.239 --> 5891.04
could also be just the braking switch

5890.56 --> 5894.2390000000005
because

5891.04 --> 5896.639
again if they do that they go that far

5894.239 --> 5898.5599999999995
then everything is going to break apart

5896.639 --> 5901.04
everything very rapidly

5898.56 --> 5903.76
and people that have been holding back

5901.04 --> 5906.96
will make their move

5903.76 --> 5909.6
so yeah

5906.96 --> 5911.119
but just regular luxuries oh you want to

5909.6 --> 5914.639
go to the football game or you want to

5911.119 --> 5918.4
go to the party oh you want to

5914.639 --> 5921.4400000000005
go fly easily to somewhere

5918.4 --> 5923.679
anything that would be easy and

5921.44 --> 5924.879999999999
integrated into bigger society bigger

5923.679 --> 5928.4
corporations yeah

5924.88 --> 5930.639
that will be stripped away from you as

5928.4 --> 5932.48
much as they can

5930.639 --> 5934.0
in order to try and push you to

5932.48 --> 5936.08
basically kill yourself

5934.0 --> 5937.36
in order to be able to continue

5936.08 --> 5953.84
pretending

5937.36 --> 5953.839999999999
like everything is still as it was yeah

5959.92 --> 5970.4
no why would you think that i have

5966.32 --> 5972.5599999999995
samson don't mind you bring it up but

5970.4 --> 5973.44
yeah why would you think that i know

5972.56 --> 5976.96
about that no

5973.44 --> 5977.5199999999995
i don't know what it is you might want

5976.96 --> 5981.84
to just

5977.52 --> 5981.84
share it over at skype

5982.08 --> 5986.639
it's weird to yeah i've never heard of

5984.4 --> 5986.638999999999
that

5989.679 --> 5995.84
damage youtube stop

5993.04 --> 5995.84
stalling

5999.92 --> 6005.36
just curious yeah look i'm not

6003.44 --> 6007.839999999999
i'm not very up to date with what

6005.36 --> 6011.28
happens on the internet overall

6007.84 --> 6014.96
right unless it directly

6011.28 --> 6016.48
relates to my social media community

6014.96 --> 6018.08
the flutter debates and all that then

6016.48 --> 6021.199
i'll be more likely to be

6018.08 --> 6023.84
aware of it because that's where i hang

6021.199 --> 6023.839999999999
around a lot

6024.96 --> 6030.159
completely uncensored free speech video

6028.239 --> 6033.759999999999
platform all right

6030.159 --> 6033.759999999999
well that sounds intanable

6035.119 --> 6038.639
uncensored free speech so does that

6037.36 --> 6044.239
include criminal

6038.639 --> 6044.2390000000005
things and yeah what is criminal right

6048.84 --> 6051.84
uh

6057.199 --> 6062.879999999999
so yeah but i don't know it might be

6060.4 --> 6062.879999999999
interesting

6063.44 --> 6069.5199999999995
it might be another gravel

6066.88 --> 6071.76
because yeah the idea completely

6069.52 --> 6074.639
uncensored free speech that sounds like

6071.76 --> 6077.280000000001
a really nice myth

6074.639 --> 6078.08
because yeah there's a lot of stupid and

6077.28 --> 6080.719
crazy

6078.08 --> 6081.5199999999995
and damaging psychologically damaging

6080.719 --> 6084.8
[ __ ]

6081.52 --> 6086.400000000001
that people will just do and think it's

6084.8 --> 6090.4800000000005
normal

6086.4 --> 6090.48
if people let them

6090.84 --> 6093.84
right

6096.96 --> 6102.159
that was that's what i was wanting to

6099.92 --> 6105.4400000000005
know yeah

6102.159 --> 6108.08
right okay anyway yeah

6105.44 --> 6109.839999999999
drop the link to it in the skype and

6108.08 --> 6121.84
i'll i'll check it out

6109.84 --> 6121.84
but i'm gonna round out the show soon so

6123.6 --> 6128.639
oh god john watson you drop about the

6127.199 --> 6131.759999999999
freaking food kitchens

6128.639 --> 6134.96
you're even saying it yourself

6131.76 --> 6137.04
evil people will do things to

6134.96 --> 6138.8
homeless blah blah blah so they have to

6137.04 --> 6141.679
rely on food banks oh does that make the

6138.8 --> 6141.679
food banks evil

6142.56 --> 6146.0
would you rather have they would go

6144.719 --> 6148.2390000000005
through the same conditions

6146.0 --> 6150.159
and then just starve to death you think

6148.239 --> 6152.239
that's a better option

6150.159 --> 6154.799999999999
yeah i think that your causal

6152.239 --> 6157.28
understanding of

6154.8 --> 6158.56
societal influence and the influence of

6157.28 --> 6163.84
food kitchens

6158.56 --> 6163.84
is kind of mixed up a little john watson

6174.239 --> 6178.799999999999
dude you literally said that

6187.199 --> 6192.08
no i'm not twisting your words it was

6189.44 --> 6195.919999999999

6192.08 --> 6195.92

6202.239 --> 6206.5599999999995
