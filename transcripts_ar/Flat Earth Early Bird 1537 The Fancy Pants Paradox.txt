as beautiful and sunny

116.159 --> 120.2

122.159 --> 126.71900000000001
rain here and there but I haven't really

124.02 --> 129.68

129.84 --> 136.08
but it's it's kind of windy and

133.58 --> 137.81900000000002
lots of clouds everywhere

265.44 --> 270.71999999999997
eventually just playing games and

268.259 --> 272.88
cooking most of the time but I mean it

270.72 --> 277.44000000000005
was a good show

272.88 --> 280.04
hello Cleary LSG Richard G

277.44 --> 280.04
h

281.16 --> 284.0
tiger bear

284.639 --> 288.6
good to see you oh

289.28 --> 294.59999999999997
fourth am

tequila hangover oof

294.6 --> 297.5
oh dear

299.3 --> 303.5
okay I'll take it easy then

307.979 --> 312.74
yeah fortunately I did not do that

314.34 --> 320.63899999999995
but I did stay up pretty late though

317.04 --> 325.02000000000004
in ball busters went on pretty long

320.639 --> 328.699
it had a whole conversation with uh

325.02 --> 328.69899999999996
humble H and

332.28 --> 336.85999999999996
who else was there righteous Force

337.259 --> 341.34000000000003
and yeah

339.12 --> 344.34000000000003
I think Adam may have been there

341.34 --> 348.419
I don't remember exactly but just long

344.34 --> 351.08
discussion was like till one o'clock

348.419 --> 351.08
poof

353.759 --> 358.8
but yeah it was a very good show

356.28 --> 363.13899999999995
also just the way the guys rolled it out

358.8 --> 363.139
I felt like yeah I mean

363.36 --> 368.039
they're getting the psychology better

366.3 --> 369.84000000000003
and better as well so it's like almost

368.039 --> 371.88
like I feel like there's nothing for me

369.84 --> 375.08
to even

371.88 --> 375.08
add to that

376.08 --> 379.88
except for a couple of jokes

384.36 --> 388.5
almost just leave you with a dull ache

387.12 --> 391.759
what does that

388.5 --> 391.759
what do you mean Cleary

392.28 --> 395.539
oh evil nightmare

404.46 --> 408.23999999999995
thank you okay

425.22 --> 429.199
all right

427.1 --> 431.759
yeah I've been

429.199 --> 434.039
staying up watching home Benjamin really

431.759 --> 437.16
at the last few hours was very

434.039 --> 440.88
interesting and hilarious

437.16 --> 443.07000000000005
and also this morning right before the

440.88 --> 445.02
show started

443.07 --> 447.3
[Music]

445.02 --> 449.88
hey what's going on here what's

447.3 --> 451.38
happening

449.88 --> 454.94
in chat

451.38 --> 454.94
thing there weird

455.88 --> 463.34
okay

458.36 --> 463.34000000000003
jackass oh my God Clary wow

465.419 --> 468.44
alrighty then

470.699 --> 474.599
it's kind of funny though because in one

472.56 --> 477.02
of Owen Benjamin streams he also brought

474.599 --> 477.02
that up

477.12 --> 481.68
like sort of the jackass generation but

479.58 --> 484.8
I think it was like from Thursday's show

481.68 --> 488.419
or Wednesdays I'm not sure

484.8 --> 488.41900000000004
not not Friday show

488.78 --> 494.23999999999995
[Music]

490.86 --> 494.24
comparing cultures

494.94 --> 500.819
it's it's interesting because I have

497.22 --> 504.91900000000004
like I had well skate their friends and

500.819 --> 504.91900000000004
they were into jackass and [ __ ] too

505.199 --> 509.099
but I mean

506.94 --> 510.66
the guy that I kind of really knew about

509.099 --> 513.419
that

510.66 --> 515.52
I had a whole history

513.419 --> 517.38
with him

515.52 --> 521.399
I mean that guy

517.38 --> 522.929
like got into drugs and then he later

521.399 --> 525.839
got into uh

522.929 --> 528.36
[Music]

525.839 --> 530.519
Scientology

528.36 --> 533.16
and he was like a real he was in many

530.519 --> 535.62
ways a very shady guy during the teens

533.16 --> 539.519
he's probably cleaned up a lot since

535.62 --> 541.62
then but I mean he was

539.519 --> 544.16
kind of like out of control in many ways

541.62 --> 544.16
socially

544.98 --> 548.82
but I mean it's probably because of well

547.26 --> 550.86
the drugs well now you can't really

548.82 --> 553.1400000000001
because he just went there he just

550.86 --> 555.54
wanted to do and you basically just

553.14 --> 558.14
wanted to do whatever he felt like

555.54 --> 558.14
like

559.14 --> 566.0
without any empathy

562.08 --> 566.0
I was like his teenage issue

567.0 --> 573.12
and that did make him kind of alpha too

571.14 --> 574.62
and that really worked so he was like

573.12 --> 576.0
doing it

574.62 --> 579.12
yeah

576.0 --> 582.959
but I mean it was so it was also shady

579.12 --> 585.18
and immoral at points and I'm not gonna

582.959 --> 587.779
go into details I mean

585.18 --> 587.779
but

588.66 --> 594.4399999999999
I think back a lot about the people that

591.42 --> 594.4399999999999
I have hung around with

601.44 --> 607.5
because I just liked it when people had

604.38 --> 609.24
some kind of influence like

607.5 --> 612.42
it's just fascinated like oh everybody

609.24 --> 614.04
just regards them in this way or they

612.42 --> 616.5799999999999
change their behavior because of the

614.04 --> 618.42
present of that person like why is that

616.58 --> 619.5300000000001
[Music]

618.42 --> 623.7199999999999
anyway

619.53 --> 623.72
[Music]

627.5 --> 631.5
okay Cleary

632.76 --> 635.76
whatever

640.32 --> 646.6400000000001
I I yeah it's not my thing Man it it

644.22 --> 646.64
isn't

652.25 --> 655.379
[Music]

658.38 --> 664.1
when you go through some stuff yeah sure

661.38 --> 664.1
I mean

664.459 --> 668.66
there's better ways of doing that

692.04 --> 696.38
whoa okay tiger bear huh

698.88 --> 700.88
ouch

710.459 --> 718.0189999999999
yeah no I never really went there I mean

714.839 --> 720.6600000000001
I just didn't like injury

718.019 --> 722.519
and like everybody that I knew there

720.66 --> 724.68
were skaters you know they always got

722.519 --> 725.94
freaking injured and I'm like dude I'm

724.68 --> 728.8389999999999
not

725.94 --> 728.839
doing that

730.079 --> 736.26
it's not worth it

732.899 --> 740.459
like I'll just focus on

736.26 --> 743.88
my agility and everything on my feet so

740.459 --> 747.7399999999999
I I kind of did Taekwondo instead

743.88 --> 749.72
and in a way my skateboard also had been

747.74 --> 754.62
a horse

749.72 --> 760.38
I mean yeah it's a very big skateboard

754.62 --> 763.62
but I mean you can definitely make Falls

760.38 --> 766.26
so like yeah I don't know horseback

763.62 --> 769.22
riding I liked it

766.26 --> 769.22
skateboarding

770.88 --> 775.98
it's also because freaking skateboarding

773.04 --> 779.04
well you have to do it on like hard

775.98 --> 782.279
surfaces right for the skate to work so

779.04 --> 783.8
you're gonna fall you're gonna get hurt

782.279 --> 787.019
most likely

783.8 --> 791.0999999999999
eventually yeah with horses

787.019 --> 793.32
you're gonna ride them softer ground

791.1 --> 795.0
yeah if you're gonna fall you're not

793.32 --> 797.82
like necessarily going to break

795.0 --> 801.8
something unless you like really fall in

797.82 --> 801.8000000000001
like yeah if you fall badly

802.92 --> 808.62
but so yeah

805.8 --> 811.579
I'm a horseback riding guy not a

808.62 --> 811.579
skateboarder guy

812.82 --> 819.86
also a horseback riding guys or people

816.48 --> 819.86
tend to dress better

825.55 --> 830.639
[Music]

827.959 --> 832.56
horses no if you're a rookie and we'll

830.639 --> 836.22
mess with you I know

832.56 --> 841.1999999999999
but that's part of the challenge right

836.22 --> 841.2
so yeah I mean there's yeah

842.04 --> 847.56
some people were really in the skating

845.22 --> 848.88
and I mean to be fair skating is much

847.56 --> 851.579
cheaper

848.88 --> 853.62
right I mean my parents actually paid

851.579 --> 854.6999999999999
for like horseback riding lessons and

853.62 --> 857.519
all that

854.7 --> 859.6800000000001
I was very lucky it was like at the time

857.519 --> 861.48
it was like yeah our family was kind of

859.68 --> 864.8389999999999
lower middle class

861.48 --> 868.4590000000001
so I felt like whoa I'm

864.839 --> 868.4590000000001
I'm a prince or something

869.1 --> 875.3000000000001
and I gotta learn horseback riding

871.8 --> 875.3
is it like an important skill

875.399 --> 879.3
but I did learn just in general a lot

877.62 --> 881.639
doing that

879.3 --> 884.639
but yeah not everybody

881.639 --> 887.0600000000001
I never knew anybody else I never had

884.639 --> 887.0600000000001
friends

887.279 --> 894.6
that were horseback riding because like

891.54 --> 896.3389999999999
those people in horseback riding culture

894.6 --> 899.1
they did kind of like eventually when

896.339 --> 900.6600000000001
they get older like form little clubs

899.1 --> 904.94
but

900.66 --> 904.9399999999999
they were like I did not like that

907.019 --> 911.04
and they didn't really I didn't really

909.12 --> 913.38
fit in with that I think

911.04 --> 916.019
like when they go all group

913.38 --> 919.399
when they group up

916.019 --> 919.399
I don't know what that is

919.86 --> 922.92
but I mean that's like pretty much with

921.899 --> 925.86
everything

922.92 --> 928.26
people just group up and get like a mob

925.86 --> 931.44
mentality of some sort and they just

928.26 --> 933.62
start behaving bad towards me I don't

931.44 --> 933.62
know

938.72 --> 941.869
[Music]

943.079 --> 946.56
hi

944.339 --> 948.5400000000001
oh you're a horseback riding guy skeptic

946.56 --> 951.06
cool

948.54 --> 952.92
yeah no I liked it all well yeah I

951.06 --> 955.8599999999999
didn't really like cleaning out the

952.92 --> 958.26
Stables but I mean I did it

955.86 --> 959.639
and I also thought like oh if I did this

958.26 --> 963.959
then

959.639 --> 966.98
maybe people will respect me more

963.959 --> 966.9799999999999
because yeah

967.56 --> 972.959
so I did that sometimes I did it even a

970.68 --> 974.88
couple of times to try to

972.959 --> 977.579
press ladies

974.88 --> 980.399
because yeah I was very much with my

977.579 --> 983.399
mind on that although yeah I never

980.399 --> 983.399
succeeded

983.82 --> 989.0400000000001
because that only happened basically

985.56 --> 990.779
through school when I was 18. and by

989.04 --> 992.8199999999999
that time I wasn't horseback riding

990.779 --> 995.22
anymore

992.82 --> 997.44
I quit like when my mom got the accident

995.22 --> 999.3000000000001
pretty much after that just the whole

997.44 --> 1001.48
thing got tainted with the memory of

999.3 --> 1001.4799999999999
that

1002.3 --> 1005.56
and I just like

1005.62 --> 1009.579
diverted to taekwondo

1012.98 --> 1019.3000000000001
girls like horse yes and the thing is

1015.5 --> 1023.139
skeptic I like girls that like horses

1019.3 --> 1023.139
I tend to like them

1026.839 --> 1031.4589999999998
but when I was much younger I was just

1029.12 --> 1033.86
basically still kind of a scored boy in

1031.459 --> 1036.38
ways and

1033.86 --> 1038.9189999999999
didn't know who I was so it just didn't

1036.38 --> 1038.919
really work

1042.5 --> 1047.439
I think now yeah it would work a lot

1045.26 --> 1047.439
better

1052.7 --> 1057.799
and anyway I I'd love to like try it out

1055.58 --> 1060.26
again just to see like

1057.799 --> 1062.539
can my body still handle it

1060.26 --> 1064.22
especially my back and my back still

1062.539 --> 1067.1
handle it

1064.22 --> 1069.559
I mean my back is pretty good but

1067.1 --> 1071.7199999999998
like for my dad his back was definitely

1069.559 --> 1074.24
the factor that made him say like no I'm

1071.72 --> 1076.16
not doing it anymore it's like

1074.24 --> 1078.14
too much of a strain and he would just

1076.16 --> 1081.2
sprain his back

1078.14 --> 1084.38
more often because of it

1081.2 --> 1086.059
I never had that issue luckily

1084.38 --> 1088.7600000000002
but

1086.059 --> 1091.7
yeah I am still a little bit older and

1088.76 --> 1093.799
when my dad started with us it's like it

1091.7 --> 1096.919
was a family thing for a moment

1093.799 --> 1099.9189999999999
only my brother didn't participate

1096.919 --> 1102.88
he doesn't like horses

1099.919 --> 1102.88
but uh

1103.34 --> 1109.24
yeah my dad was of course it was kind of

1105.38 --> 1109.24
like my age I guess

1110.419 --> 1115.72
when he got into it and he got issues

1112.7 --> 1115.72
with his back from it

1116.24 --> 1120.799
not lasting it's just while he was doing

1118.46 --> 1123.08
it and he quit because of that and well

1120.799 --> 1125.78
my mother got an accident and yeah so it

1123.08 --> 1128.1789999999999
just all kind of like collapsed in on

1125.78 --> 1130.6399999999999
itself that whole

1128.179 --> 1133.299
family culture little thing that I

1130.64 --> 1133.2990000000002
thought I had

1134.48 --> 1139.22
was really all very tragic it did like

1137.36 --> 1141.9799999999998
that that was like the last family

1139.22 --> 1143.84
culture thing that was really consistent

1141.98 --> 1146.48
after that

1143.84 --> 1151.36
my mom got worse and

1146.48 --> 1153.98
the fighting just like became intainable

1151.36 --> 1155.539
not physically violent but just in

1153.98 --> 1156.679
tanimal like they wouldn't cool down

1155.539 --> 1160.1
anymore

1156.679 --> 1162.44
and just everything got [ __ ]

1160.1 --> 1165.799
the horseback riding times were like

1162.44 --> 1167.9
very good Angelic like times for me it

1165.799 --> 1171.2
was very happy there

1167.9 --> 1172.4
felt very good about myself very

1171.2 --> 1175.28
confident

1172.4 --> 1177.8600000000001
and that like I did feel like an alpha

1175.28 --> 1180.5
in a way even even though I wasn't like

1177.86 --> 1183.74
I mean I wasn't like some Grand leader

1180.5 --> 1186.2
that everybody was just like oh no I was

1183.74 --> 1186.53
just a kid I was kind of a scored boy I

1186.2 --> 1190.6190000000001

[Music]

1191.12 --> 1196.9599999999998

1194.0 --> 1196.96
always have

1198.679 --> 1204.5
to to try to be Noble in every way and

1201.559 --> 1207.46
be exemplary and yeah

1204.5 --> 1207.46
but I mean

1207.799 --> 1212.24
never really lost it

1209.9 --> 1214.5800000000002
but had a lot of disappointments in my

1212.24 --> 1218.419
life concerning that

1214.58 --> 1221.4189999999999
sizing myself up like bigger and more

1218.419 --> 1226.0590000000002
impressive than I really am

1221.419 --> 1226.0590000000002
so I tend to not do that anymore

1226.58 --> 1230.1599999999999

unless I get really pissed off

1236.84 --> 1241.1
and then even then I'm like very

1239.0 --> 1243.7
restrained because I've had a lot of

1241.1 --> 1248.6
damage for putting myself out there

1243.7 --> 1251.0
overestimating my my value and how how

1248.6 --> 1252.98
good I how impressive I am to other

1251.0 --> 1255.16

uh

1274.64 --> 1277.7800000000002
I'm not sure

1278.36 --> 1282.799
I don't know if that's even phrased like

1281.0 --> 1286.4
that in the Netherlands I mean there's

1282.799 --> 1289.82
like a whole language that is very Dutch

1286.4 --> 1293.8400000000001
that is all about horseback riding

1289.82 --> 1297.559
I I don't know if it's like that

1293.84 --> 1300.6999999999998
lockstep compatible with the English

1297.559 --> 1300.7
see me Traveler

1303.32 --> 1307.6589999999999
but I can roughly describe it I mean

1312.32 --> 1317.48
could you summarize roughly what the

1314.9 --> 1319.8400000000001
difference would typically be then I can

1317.48 --> 1319.84
tell you

1336.679 --> 1342.5590000000002
but I don't know my first glance

1339.32 --> 1345.1589999999999
suspicion I'd say English saddle

1342.559 --> 1345.1589999999999
uh

1346.78 --> 1352.1
Western writing

1349.52 --> 1354.52
I was not saddle it's the the method of

1352.1 --> 1354.52
writing

1365.26 --> 1368.47
[Music]

1372.88 --> 1376.6000000000001
what is it described

1382.159 --> 1384.7
foreign

1390.62 --> 1393.82
this is annoying

1394.34 --> 1400.539
oh yeah an article and then they don't

1396.799 --> 1400.539
show an example at all

1415.159 --> 1419.6000000000001
okay but if it is typically arranged

1417.919 --> 1421.76
this is what I'm deriving from this

1419.6 --> 1424.76
article that like the English style is

1421.76 --> 1427.64
like more elaborate more detail of your

1424.76 --> 1429.44
composure and the way to do it it's very

1427.64 --> 1433.0
about form

1429.44 --> 1435.3200000000002
then absolutely we did English

1433.0 --> 1437.919
absolutely because it was very much

1435.32 --> 1437.9189999999999
about that

1440.659 --> 1445.419
so I'd say yeah we did English form

1445.58 --> 1449.6589999999999
because there was it was a lot about

1447.26 --> 1453.2
your composure and all that and

1449.659 --> 1456.74
like how you hold your back and just how

1453.2 --> 1458.48
you do things and like it was very

1456.74 --> 1462.44
detailed

1458.48 --> 1464.6
you they have like their eyes on you and

1462.44 --> 1467.179
how you did things because like there

1464.6 --> 1470.3799999999999
was like the right way to do it and the

1467.179 --> 1470.38
wrong ways to do it

1471.799 --> 1478.12
that's it

1474.14 --> 1478.1200000000001
so I'd say what

1486.559 --> 1489.559
skeptic

1491.059 --> 1496.22
I I don't know dressed

1493.58 --> 1499.1
dressed we didn't really have a dress

1496.22 --> 1502.78
code I mean if you D if you did like

1499.1 --> 1502.78
matches you'd have to dress code

1502.88 --> 1506.74
but there wasn't really a dress code

1507.44 --> 1513.6200000000001
although you did have to have a cap

1510.98 --> 1515.84
Etc and they did also demand you have

1513.62 --> 1518.9189999999999
riding boots because otherwise it might

1515.84 --> 1518.9189999999999
hurt the horse

1520.039 --> 1526.22
uh

1522.38 --> 1529.5800000000002
no Sharp uh what do you call it braces

1526.22 --> 1532.96
things you put on your feet the Poke no

1529.58 --> 1532.96
sharp ones allow whatever

1533.64 --> 1536.789
[Music]

1543.46 --> 1547.24
right and they also

1547.7 --> 1552.5
no

1550.039 --> 1554.539
yeah yeah those were roughly the

1552.5 --> 1557.179
parameters that I remember that kind of

1554.539 --> 1560.36
like set up

1557.179 --> 1564.3200000000002
where they explain some things about it

1560.36 --> 1566.6
so yeah I think overall it's just

1564.32 --> 1570.32
English Style

1566.6 --> 1573.74
and probably like not the highest of

1570.32 --> 1575.8999999999999
Military Academy level horseback riding

1573.74 --> 1579.679
right but

1575.9 --> 1583.46
I mean they did really do their best

1579.679 --> 1585.919
and there were also people there

1583.46 --> 1587.8400000000001
that were engaging in like Championship

1585.919 --> 1590.179
things

1587.84 --> 1592.059
not like even my group but they were

1590.179 --> 1595.88
associated with that

1592.059 --> 1598.22
uh with that wrench

1595.88 --> 1601.0590000000002
said color wrench

1598.22 --> 1601.059

wasn't a ranch

1612.559 --> 1615.22
uh

1617.059 --> 1621.5
there's a special word in Dutch so

1619.7 --> 1623.6000000000001
they're like oh there's a special word

1621.5 --> 1626.179
for it in English too no it's just a

1623.6 --> 1627.6789999999999

absolutely

1650.72 --> 1655.22
absolutely

1653.059 --> 1656.6589999999999
I mean I might get a little bit I might

1655.22 --> 1661.179
be a little bit Rusty at first like

1656.659 --> 1661.179
overlooking some little things

1661.64 --> 1668.6000000000001

1664.58 --> 1670.6999999999998
over two decades but overall I know

1668.6 --> 1673.8799999999999
horseback riding I was really fanatical

1670.7 --> 1676.64
about it so it's I really got those

1673.88 --> 1678.98
skills on reflex I just have to get into

1676.64 --> 1682.76
it a bit

1678.98 --> 1687.02
and then I'll just know again

1682.76 --> 1690.5
although not the words for like

1687.02 --> 1692.96
there's a whole range of names for every

1690.5 --> 1695.62
little bit of the saddle and the the

1692.96 --> 1695.6200000000001
brittle and

1696.44 --> 1700.88
I will definitely not get those words

1699.14 --> 1703.64
right in English because I learned them

1700.88 --> 1706.3400000000001
in Dutch never learned them in English

1703.64 --> 1707.96
and it's been a long time I and I'm not

1706.34 --> 1710.0
really good at memorizing at all with

1707.96 --> 1712.82

1710.0 --> 1716.299
dealing with it again on like a weekly

1712.82 --> 1718.81

1732.2 --> 1736.94
enough to say yeah I can actually

1734.539 --> 1740.98
horseback right I could even do it

1736.94 --> 1740.98
without a saddle I have done that

not too

1754.82 --> 1759.86
too rebellious

into like like a rebel outside or

1805.64 --> 1810.6200000000001
whatever but they'll never marry they'll

1808.7 --> 1812.059
just keep you your secret lover or

1810.62 --> 1814.34
whatever and you'll never get anything

1812.059 --> 1817.1589999999999

1839.72 --> 1846.919

all right because if she's on the fence

1944.539 --> 1949.279
kind of me against the world in a lot of

1974.36 --> 1979.039
[Music]

1975.86 --> 1981.6399999999999
bit of Effie's come on Steve

1979.039 --> 1981.64
kidding me

1981.74 --> 1987.279
a few women who would like to meet you

1984.2 --> 1987.279
what day

1989.84 --> 1995.1789999999999
I'm not noticing

1992.419 --> 1998.3600000000001
I mean there's who's stopping them right

1995.179 --> 2001.179
my emails right there my address is

1998.36 --> 2004.059
basically public

2001.179 --> 2007.3200000000002
I'm very open about they're not lining

2004.059 --> 2007.32
up steamy Traveler

2007.899 --> 2015.2399999999998
and I'm right here live

2011.08 --> 2018.22
every day life every time interactive

2015.24 --> 2020.98
option for communication or less

2018.22 --> 2023.14
interactive through email right it's not

2020.98 --> 2026.08
happening so

2023.14 --> 2028.0
I thank you for your praise but I don't

2026.08 --> 2032.46
think that's

2028.0 --> 2032.46
an accurate description of reality

2032.62 --> 2037.12
I think a lot of Fe women don't really

2035.14 --> 2039.1000000000001
know about me or they got to see a

2037.12 --> 2041.26
couple of Clips or where I'm really

2039.1 --> 2044.6399999999999
freaking angry and they were just like

2041.26 --> 2044.64
oh this guy's insane

2045.519 --> 2049.359
yeah

2046.72 --> 2053.02
that's the dilemma here

2049.359 --> 2055.419
is that in person I I would never act

2053.02 --> 2058.0
like that to a woman ever

2055.419 --> 2059.1389999999997
we're in the same room never

2058.0 --> 2061.899
ever

2059.139 --> 2065.2200000000003
so that's

2061.899 --> 2065.22
a bit of an issue there

2072.76 --> 2076.7400000000002
you want younger ones

2077.859 --> 2084.04
find someone else what do you mean

2081.04 --> 2087.04
what are you talking about Darren

2084.04 --> 2091.06
there is plenty of women on the fence a

2087.04 --> 2092.859
lot of women don't want to get into it

2091.06 --> 2096.2799999999997
there's women that are just more

2092.859 --> 2099.7599999999998
concerned about like hey

2096.28 --> 2103.0
could I start a family how stable is my

2099.76 --> 2104.5600000000004
man is what he's into is that gonna lead

2103.0 --> 2106.599
somewhere

2104.56 --> 2109.06
right they're not

2106.599 --> 2112.119
they're women that I look for that I

2109.06 --> 2114.94
like typically are not into

2112.119 --> 2116.92
Flat Earth like I am they might be

2114.94 --> 2118.7200000000003
interested or love to hear me out that

2116.92 --> 2121.48
would be great

2118.72 --> 2123.8199999999997
it might even like agree with me but not

2121.48 --> 2124.78
like have their own personal ambition

2123.82 --> 2126.52
and

2124.78 --> 2129.3390000000004
within it

2126.52 --> 2131.68
because we'd end up bumping bumping

2129.339 --> 2133.98
heads at some point that's gonna happen

2131.68 --> 2133.98
then

2136.599 --> 2143.2200000000003
now I on average

2138.839 --> 2143.22
gamma I'd love like to say that

2143.94 --> 2151.2000000000003
wife I'd rather be that she'd be into

2147.82 --> 2151.2000000000003
a social activity

2152.079 --> 2156.82
but she's really good at that because

2153.88 --> 2161.1600000000003
I'm not I'm a freaking hermit and I

2156.82 --> 2161.1600000000003
really love to be pulled around

2161.859 --> 2168.04
by by a girlfriend to see me people and

2165.88 --> 2171.4
to have that

2168.04 --> 2173.14
Safeguard of like oh but I am

2171.4 --> 2176.44
a boyfriend

2173.14 --> 2177.7
so I don't have to like face like ah

2176.44 --> 2180.099
people

2177.7 --> 2181.839
hi

2180.099 --> 2185.5
I don't really know how to compose

2181.839 --> 2188.44
myself this is right or if I am a

2185.5 --> 2192.28
boyfriend then I have a function

2188.44 --> 2194.079
and then that safeguards me a lot better

2192.28 --> 2196.78
so

2194.079 --> 2199.0600000000004
does not hang around high school parking

2196.78 --> 2201.579
lot yeah

2199.06 --> 2203.44
dude hanging around these high schools I

2201.579 --> 2206.92
mean I sometimes go on my bicycle past

2203.44 --> 2210.16
them people that hang around there

2206.92 --> 2212.6800000000003
is it not my type

2210.16 --> 2215.94
not even I've never seen one when I'm

2212.68 --> 2217.7999999999997
like oh damn she's a bit young but oh no

2215.94 --> 2221.56
no

2217.8 --> 2223.3
I don't know they're not there

2221.56 --> 2225.339
but maybe it's because it's like an art

2223.3 --> 2228.0600000000004
school or whatever it's just not my type

2225.339 --> 2228.06
at all

2234.339 --> 2238.66
I thought originally that was my type

2236.32 --> 2240.579
because I had that interest

2238.66 --> 2242.2
so they're like oh if they're into what

2240.579 --> 2244.119
I'm into then

2242.2 --> 2247.0
we can connect

2244.119 --> 2250.98
and then I can hold on to that

2247.0 --> 2250.98
but I don't think like that anymore so

2252.94 --> 2260.88
artsy women are hot

2255.94 --> 2260.88
uh yeah unless they're not

2263.38 --> 2268.7200000000003
although yeah my my ex was a bit artsy

2265.96 --> 2271.7200000000003
and making clove and

2268.72 --> 2274.18
yeah I mean when they're hot and they're

2271.72 --> 2276.52
into art it's a blast

2274.18 --> 2278.2
it's an absolute Blast for sure but that

2276.52 --> 2279.88
doesn't mean that all women that are

2278.2 --> 2281.6189999999997
into art are hot

2279.88 --> 2283.42
contrary

2281.619 --> 2286.2400000000002
a lot of them are very interesting

2283.42 --> 2289.38
though if they're not like politically

2286.24 --> 2289.3799999999997
deranged or something

2289.72 --> 2295.859
okay

2291.76 --> 2295.8590000000004
I will bend my expectations now

2301.0 --> 2304.32
no that's not gonna happen

2308.32 --> 2312.1800000000003
if it's the right room it's the right

2309.94 --> 2312.18
woman

2313.42 --> 2318.579
I'm just going by what I have already

2316.42 --> 2322.9
like it's not like I don't look around

2318.579 --> 2325.42
guys it's not like I don't like hey what

2322.9 --> 2327.88
it what is who is that

2325.42 --> 2329.619
I I'm not really approaching right but

2327.88 --> 2332.02
I'm at least looking around just to see

2329.619 --> 2334.2400000000002
like what the hell is out there

2332.02 --> 2336.16
and like what are what are the married

2334.24 --> 2338.2599999999998
women look like do they look like they

2336.16 --> 2339.3999999999996
actually come from here or they like

2338.26 --> 2341.38
from

2339.4 --> 2343.599
somewhere else in the Netherlands there

2341.38 --> 2347.2200000000003
I'm just looking at like all these women

2343.599 --> 2347.2200000000003
like what is out there because

2351.28 --> 2356.619
there are some really like really

2354.339 --> 2358.66
appealing beautiful mothers out there

2356.619 --> 2359.92
though that I see it also in this

2358.66 --> 2362.0789999999997
neighborhood

2359.92 --> 2364.0
where I'm like oh damn it I'm so

2362.079 --> 2367.54
freaking jealous of that guy but I could

2364.0 --> 2370.5
never stand in his shoes probably

2367.54 --> 2370.5
not like that

2378.24 --> 2382.02
personality wise

2383.74 --> 2386.2799999999997
okay

2394.359 --> 2400.54
they act like you did something yeah

2397.2 --> 2403.2999999999997
they do sometimes like it's really it

2400.54 --> 2405.7
can be really scary

2403.3 --> 2408.28
but there's tricks to it though

2405.7 --> 2410.0789999999997
but it has to be circumstantial

2408.28 --> 2412.0
I mean if you're really gonna go for it

2410.079 --> 2415.079
then you just use the environment and

2412.0 --> 2415.079
circumstances to

2415.18 --> 2419.44
kind of like take a little step and then

2416.98 --> 2423.72
get a little closer and then just like

2419.44 --> 2423.7200000000003
break open a conversation or whatever

2427.78 --> 2432.579
or see if you like find you could find

2430.96 --> 2435.82
something that's just really into that

2432.579 --> 2438.4
just makes her feel good and then like

2435.82 --> 2441.099
see if you can yeah it's called picking

2438.4 --> 2442.6600000000003
up somebody but it does work but it only

2441.099 --> 2445.9
works

2442.66 --> 2448.06
when it works with me

2445.9 --> 2450.82
it usually doesn't work because the

2448.06 --> 2452.2599999999998
person I might be interested in is just

2450.82 --> 2455.8
not right

2452.26 --> 2458.44
I'm just like oh but maybe it could work

2455.8 --> 2461.02
and then basically like my Consciousness

2458.44 --> 2463.42
is more eager than my subconscious which

2461.02 --> 2467.2599999999998
is like nope

2463.42 --> 2470.46
I think that but nope it's not not the

2467.26 --> 2470.46
one not the one

2475.839 --> 2481.74
that's a level on five reference but

2479.74 --> 2481.74
um

2483.339 --> 2491.64
it'll happen sometime and maybe it won't

2486.82 --> 2491.6400000000003
and then dude whatever man I yeah

2493.0 --> 2498.52
but if I got some fancy pants

2496.78 --> 2500.7400000000002
then

2498.52 --> 2505.599
I'd definitely be more inclined to just

2500.74 --> 2509.339
like put myself out there like go places

2505.599 --> 2509.339
besides the supermarket

2519.94 --> 2526.56
I'm not accustomed to being hit um well

2522.46 --> 2526.56
skeptic for me it's very simple

2528.88 --> 2534.52
they either anticipated because they

2531.579 --> 2536.26
want it or they don't and then it's

2534.52 --> 2539.04
awkward

2536.26 --> 2539.0400000000004
that's it

2552.04 --> 2554.7
foreign

2564.339 --> 2568.599
yeah

2566.619 --> 2570.88
but

2568.599 --> 2573.48
the main point is is that they are

2570.88 --> 2573.48
attracted

2576.82 --> 2584.76
right and to maintain that attraction

2579.819 --> 2584.7599999999998
yeah confidence is very useful

2585.46 --> 2589.48
the point is is that just by being

2587.5 --> 2592.359
confident you can't make somebody

2589.48 --> 2594.48
attracted to you they just have to be

2592.359 --> 2599.22
attracted to you there has to be like a

2594.48 --> 2599.22
physical connection too in a way

2599.619 --> 2605.1400000000003
it's not about a decision or

2602.319 --> 2608.5
just has to work the chemistry has to

2605.14 --> 2612.48
work and then confidence will like

2608.5 --> 2612.48
lighten lighten up the flame

2614.92 --> 2620.619
but if there is no physical attraction

2618.22 --> 2622.1189999999997
like if it's just not meant to be then

2620.619 --> 2623.6800000000003
you can be all with confidence in the

2622.119 --> 2626.1400000000003
world and they'll just think like oh

2623.68 --> 2628.4199999999996
that's it's just being so nice to me

2626.14 --> 2631.359
right

2628.42 --> 2633.579
they'll let you run out of steam not

2631.359 --> 2636.42
really realizing that you're even

2633.579 --> 2636.42
interested

2638.92 --> 2642.119
I've had that happen

2651.4 --> 2655.619
I guess that would fall under flirting

2666.76 --> 2674.0400000000004
well I could do a party don't get rich

2669.4 --> 2674.04
now now this little teenage talk dude

2676.0 --> 2681.339
it's hilarious no but what will work

2678.4 --> 2684.7000000000003
when you work into a party is if people

2681.339 --> 2687.7
there actually turn out to be

2684.7 --> 2690.2999999999997
kind of are the men if the men are just

2687.7 --> 2690.2999999999997
kind of lame

2693.76 --> 2698.98
or nah it's not true

2697.06 --> 2702.339
I don't know man I haven't really walked

2698.98 --> 2705.359
into a party of people my age for

2702.339 --> 2705.359
for a long time

2732.52 --> 2737.56
right but I'm not typically a guy that

2735.819 --> 2740.079
would walk in or like he doesn't give

2737.56 --> 2743.2599999999998
you [ __ ] I'm not like that I'm an

2740.079 --> 2745.3590000000004
observer I go in fascinated and just

2743.26 --> 2748.3590000000004
like holy [ __ ] look at this

2745.359 --> 2750.7
gigantic libraries of information that

2748.359 --> 2753.52
are kind of halfway open right now

2750.7 --> 2756.3999999999996
it's like yeah people

2753.52 --> 2758.44
so many people in the same spot and

2756.4 --> 2760.7200000000003
they're all kind of half their guard

2758.44 --> 2763.06
down so like

2760.72 --> 2765.64
at first I'm basically just observing

2763.06 --> 2768.22
and feasting on spiritual metadata

2765.64 --> 2770.8799999999997
because there's a lot of it for me in

2768.22 --> 2770.8799999999997
such occasions

2770.98 --> 2775.78
so I'm not like I'm just gonna get in

2774.099 --> 2777.52
I'm like oh I'm the center of attention

2775.78 --> 2780.579
because I'm really busy with something

2777.52 --> 2782.92
and now everything's about me

2780.579 --> 2786.0
because I'm really cool it's not my

2782.92 --> 2786.0
style at all

2788.44 --> 2794.579
hey Richie

2790.72 --> 2794.5789999999997
zero zero zero zero zero

2801.16 --> 2805.839
right yeah Richie thank you by the way

2803.44 --> 2808.359
for your input like that

2805.839 --> 2809.88
it's been uh like all these old men here

2808.359 --> 2812.56
giving me advice

2809.88 --> 2815.02
it's good to hear an actual young lady

2812.56 --> 2817.2999999999997
uh give me some input about that thanks

2815.02 --> 2819.4
for that

2817.3 --> 2822.2200000000003
but uh

2819.4 --> 2824.8
yeah arrogance is not appreciated but I

2822.22 --> 2827.68
think also just really important is that

2824.8 --> 2831.579
you don't squirt not

2827.68 --> 2833.7999999999997
you know not literally but is that you

2831.579 --> 2836.079
don't get really triggered

2833.8 --> 2840.0
like women don't like it if you get

2836.079 --> 2840.0
triggered in their face

2843.339 --> 2847.359
that's what I've noticed like unless it

2845.56 --> 2849.88
is triggered about something that they

2847.359 --> 2851.44
absolutely agree with you and then they

2849.88 --> 2853.7200000000003
will back you

2851.44 --> 2855.52
and I love it

2853.72 --> 2857.7999999999997
if you get traded over something that

2855.52 --> 2861.48
they're not interested in it really

2857.8 --> 2861.48
really annoys women

2864.76 --> 2870.2200000000003
that's my experience

2867.76 --> 2875.099
don't know if you could

2870.22 --> 2875.0989999999997
like attest to that raichi

2889.54 --> 2893.44
right so it's basically like gamma Bay

2892.0 --> 2895.54
if you're getting really triggered about

2893.44 --> 2899.819
something that they think is really

2895.54 --> 2899.819
important but they're the only ones

2900.64 --> 2903.42
ah

2910.3 --> 2913.02
okay

2922.18 --> 2924.8799999999997
right

2923.31 --> 2926.619
[Music]

2924.88 --> 2929.079
yeah

2926.619 --> 2931.0
and the funny thing is is that it's not

2929.079 --> 2933.6400000000003
so much Mutual I think that a lot of

2931.0 --> 2935.56
this domain is their own sexist and that

2933.64 --> 2938.02
well who the [ __ ] I like what am I

2935.56 --> 2941.7
kidding I don't care there's a lot of

2938.02 --> 2944.8
men that are kind of used to like women

2941.7 --> 2948.16
they're like oh yes dear that's that's

2944.8 --> 2949.3590000000004
really like men can tolerate [ __ ]

2948.16 --> 2951.7
from women

2949.359 --> 2955.0
better than women can tolerate [ __ ]

2951.7 --> 2956.98
for men when it comes to yapping

2955.0 --> 2959.14
and getting triggered

2956.98 --> 2962.819
I think that that's uh

2959.14 --> 2962.819
solid thing that I can say

2967.9 --> 2972.94
I'm very capable of tolerating women

2970.96 --> 2975.28
yeah because I mean I have a friend and

2972.94 --> 2978.839
I make literally she calls me and then

2975.28 --> 2982.7200000000003
it's like three hours long like

2978.839 --> 2986.38
tragedy and hectic situations like

2982.72 --> 2987.7
completely it's like her own war and you

2986.38 --> 2989.619
get to listen to that for three hours

2987.7 --> 2992.7
and give her advice like I am very

2989.619 --> 2992.7000000000003
capable of doing that

2994.599 --> 2999.819
but if I have to listen to something

2996.88 --> 3002.3
like that from a man I'd get really sick

2999.819 --> 3002.3
of it

3002.4 --> 3008.339
ah and that's also why I try not to do

3007.38 --> 3010.319
that

3008.339 --> 3012.42
because I used to do that like when I

3010.319 --> 3014.94
was really [ __ ] miserable and like oh

3012.42 --> 3016.56
I'm so depressed

3014.94 --> 3019.16
I call people and then just start

3016.56 --> 3019.16
whining

3019.26 --> 3025.44
about how shitty things are and I mean

3022.619 --> 3027.54
that is really like when a woman does

3025.44 --> 3031.64
that it's kind of annoying but when a

3027.54 --> 3031.64
man does that it is really annoying

3031.74 --> 3036.8999999999996
so every time I feel really Miserable

3033.9 --> 3039.96
Now like that does occasionally happen

3036.9 --> 3040.859
but very not nearly as much as it used

3039.96 --> 3043.56
to

3040.859 --> 3045.119
I isolate myself I'm like no I'm not

3043.56 --> 3048.0
gonna call anybody it's like Oh I wanna

3045.119 --> 3050.339
I wanna like yeah but then I bring my

3048.0 --> 3052.559
misery to them that's what happens I'm

3050.339 --> 3054.24
like yeah no no just [ __ ] you orange

3052.559 --> 3056.6400000000003
you're just gonna sit there and you're

3054.24 --> 3059.64
just gonna swallow that thing until it's

3056.64 --> 3061.68
gone all by yourself all along with your

3059.64 --> 3063.54
misery so [ __ ] you

3061.68 --> 3066.66
don't

3063.54 --> 3068.819
don't let that demon jump towards

3066.66 --> 3072.96
somebody else

3068.819 --> 3075.72
squish it inside on your own

3072.96 --> 3077.819
and I think that everybody in the world

3075.72 --> 3078.839
pretty much appreciates that I do that

3077.819 --> 3082.02
now

3078.839 --> 3085.68
this is my family

3082.02 --> 3088.559
my dad definitely appreciates that I

3085.68 --> 3090.2999999999997
well sometimes I still kind of burst but

3088.559 --> 3091.92
it's like yeah then it's like almost

3090.3 --> 3095.3390000000004
crying

3091.92 --> 3097.7400000000002
like uh just going crazy and then I was

3095.339 --> 3101.46
out like once I do that I'll round it

3097.74 --> 3103.7999999999997
out really quickly like I will

3101.46 --> 3106.14
make sure that they don't like ah on the

3103.8 --> 3108.3
intense level very long but they're like

3106.14 --> 3111.48
make sure that I'll just be calm again

3108.3 --> 3113.28
like within three minutes

3111.48 --> 3116.2400000000002
of doing that

3113.28 --> 3116.2400000000002
and then it's okay

3118.8 --> 3121.1600000000003
yeah

3121.68 --> 3125.5989999999997
what are you talking about Theory

3135.66 --> 3141.02
of interesting unique men are they that

3138.599 --> 3141.02
bored

3143.46 --> 3147.7200000000003
or the men so lame there sorry

3146.339 --> 3149.7
just

3147.72 --> 3151.68
it's kind of weird when you hear

3149.7 --> 3154.68
somebody say from another country like

3151.68 --> 3156.54
oh man get over here they love you and I

3154.68 --> 3158.339
always think like oh what are your own

3156.54 --> 3161.9
men not good enough

3158.339 --> 3161.9
that's a worrying sign

3168.359 --> 3172.02
but I'm not gonna poke you too hard with

3171.119 --> 3175.02
that

3172.02 --> 3176.88
thank you though thank you for

3175.02 --> 3178.8
the compliment that I basically

3176.88 --> 3181.8
completely raped

3178.8 --> 3181.8
sorry

3185.58 --> 3190.2
[Music]

3186.8 --> 3193.319
ah hard to find Flat Earth or men in New

3190.2 --> 3195.0
York how about any non-gamas

3193.319 --> 3198.2
in New York

3195.0 --> 3198.2
that would be pretty cool

3200.099 --> 3203.6600000000003
although they'd just be out of place

3223.92 --> 3226.46
okay

3235.44 --> 3241.559
all right oh by the way just because I

3238.02 --> 3244.2
am generally tolerant of women and their

3241.559 --> 3246.3
yapping doesn't mean that I like to be

3244.2 --> 3248.64
swarmed by women that are just like oh

3246.3 --> 3251.46
he likes that does he oh okay then we'll

3248.64 --> 3253.98
all just like 20 women just constantly

3251.46 --> 3258.48
wanting my attention

3253.98 --> 3260.819
that I will not appreciate

3258.48 --> 3263.64
so

3260.819 --> 3266.4
it's just that I have that capability

3263.64 --> 3269.52
it's like a skill I need if I ever want

3266.4 --> 3272.1800000000003
to have a wife then I will meet her to

3269.52 --> 3272.18
be able to

3272.579 --> 3277.46
do that and then still contain it

3294.9 --> 3300.059
all right it's not it's not like Oh no

3297.18 --> 3302.94
just I'll just like for eight hours

3300.059 --> 3305.46
straight just have women calling me and

3302.94 --> 3308.28
just blah blah blah blah blah blah dude

3305.46 --> 3310.7400000000002
no no no no no I don't especially like

3308.28 --> 3313.6800000000003
if women really feel like there can use

3310.74 --> 3316.14
me right doing that

3313.68 --> 3320.339
like they don't really care

3316.14 --> 3325.2599999999998
they just wanna they just wanna

3320.339 --> 3328.5
do that act out through yapping I I can

3325.26 --> 3333.38
feel when women do that

3328.5 --> 3333.38
and I immediately like no

3333.839 --> 3337.98
but if they're really a friend and they

3336.119 --> 3339.839
do actually care about me like my friend

3337.98 --> 3342.42
from America

3339.839 --> 3343.98
and that's palpable it's provable during

3342.42 --> 3346.02
the conversation that we are actually

3343.98 --> 3350.16
connecting and that she's really knowing

3346.02 --> 3352.44
me as I know her then yes I can tolerate

3350.16 --> 3356.22
a lot

3352.44 --> 3358.16
but I will not just be some guy that a

3356.22 --> 3362.0989999999997
woman can just like

3358.16 --> 3364.5589999999997
oh stressed out just yap yap yap yap and

3362.099 --> 3367.559
doesn't really give a [ __ ] about me the

3364.559 --> 3371.059
guy I can feel that

3367.559 --> 3374.48
so don't keep get your hopes up that I'm

3371.059 --> 3374.48
usable for that

3381.42 --> 3386.4
I mean if you're gonna try that out

3383.04 --> 3389.48
probably like say something sexist

3386.4 --> 3389.48
just to make you stop

3408.119 --> 3412.619
you should be charging your roommate

3410.28 --> 3415.02
when she does it

3412.619 --> 3416.94
that's hilarious well you can do it

3415.02 --> 3420.9
another way LSG when there's no

3416.94 --> 3423.48
possibility to like officialize it

3420.9 --> 3427.04
you can just

3423.48 --> 3427.04
take something back

3427.38 --> 3431.1600000000003
in a way

3428.94 --> 3434.16
also to make it clear like yeah you do

3431.16 --> 3435.48
that with me cost me energy so I'm gonna

3434.16 --> 3438.1189999999997
do this

3435.48 --> 3439.5
and you're gonna tolerate that and then

3438.119 --> 3441.359
it's balanced

3439.5 --> 3444.24
because as soon as you don't tolerate

3441.359 --> 3446.0989999999997
that then I won't tolerate you doing

3444.24 --> 3447.54
your thing

3446.099 --> 3449.7000000000003
so you

3447.54 --> 3452.22
yeah but I mean if you're going to do

3449.7 --> 3454.4399999999996
that though it's gonna get more tense

3452.22 --> 3456.4199999999996
there is risk that there might be

3454.44 --> 3459.7200000000003
conflict out of that eventually so you

3456.42 --> 3461.7000000000003
gotta size it up carefully

3459.72 --> 3463.14
but that is how I would do it if there's

3461.7 --> 3466.64
somebody that just

3463.14 --> 3466.64
by habit just next

3468.0 --> 3472.44
if you're just gonna tell them to cut it

3470.04 --> 3475.68
off can be really complicated and

3472.44 --> 3477.599
difficult just like stop it but you

3475.68 --> 3480.1189999999997
could just make

3477.599 --> 3484.619
create a counterbalance by like

3480.119 --> 3487.2200000000003
well I like doing this or hey you have

3484.619 --> 3487.2200000000003
this and that

3487.619 --> 3490.92
you can go yapping at me if I can use

3489.839 --> 3493.14
that

3490.92 --> 3495.42
or do that

3493.14 --> 3497.16
and and you don't even have to say it

3495.42 --> 3500.2200000000003
you could just do it

3497.16 --> 3502.5
right she's just doing it just yapping

3500.22 --> 3504.54
well you can just do that thing then

3502.5 --> 3507.44
just decide

3504.54 --> 3507.44
and then

3508.38 --> 3512.7000000000003
see what happens I don't know it's just

3510.839 --> 3515.099
a suggestion

3512.7 --> 3516.9199999999996
because it's actually charging a

3515.099 --> 3521.7200000000003
roommate for talking

3516.92 --> 3521.7200000000003
that's probably never gonna happen

3522.48 --> 3528.42
I mean you'd have to have like some kind

3524.52 --> 3530.78
of a power over them like

3528.42 --> 3533.4
in

3530.78 --> 3537.619
yeah some kind of legal power in a way

3533.4 --> 3537.619
otherwise that's gonna not work

3537.72 --> 3542.9599999999996
just start talking about this and then

3540.299 --> 3542.96
she goes away

3543.42 --> 3548.7200000000003
okay that could work

3546.059 --> 3548.7200000000003
I guess

3554.88 --> 3560.4
man I got so many people in chat

3558.359 --> 3561.96
it's great though love it

3560.4 --> 3564.98
thanks for all being there and hope

3561.96 --> 3564.98
you're enjoying the show

3568.02 --> 3574.4
don't forget the rogans it up even

3570.24 --> 3574.3999999999996
before the show ends

3574.43 --> 3577.58
[Music]

3588.299 --> 3592.88
it works every time that's kind of funny

3598.319 --> 3600.5
foreign

3602.48 --> 3609.059
types of yapping women like that maybe

3606.0 --> 3610.92
men too that are gays or something that

3609.059 --> 3612.96
you have like that because gays yep like

3610.92 --> 3614.339
women too a lot

3612.96 --> 3617.04
hey

3614.339 --> 3621.0
seen it they have the same it works the

3617.04 --> 3624.9
same the same impulse the same format so

3621.0 --> 3626.359
but yeah a lot of those certain types of

3624.9 --> 3628.799
yappers

3626.359 --> 3631.98
yeah if you start to talk about flatter

3628.799 --> 3636.18
then suddenly they

3631.98 --> 3638.4
they lose their Loosely based on reality

3636.18 --> 3640.5
view of things where they're just

3638.4 --> 3643.319
digging and just keeping going

3640.5 --> 3645.299
some internal thing

3643.319 --> 3647.819
if you then suddenly talk about flatter

3645.299 --> 3651.859
then that completely disrupts the focus

3647.819 --> 3651.859
of doing that because it's like what

3654.78 --> 3657.799
so that could work

3661.14 --> 3666.299
it it would kind of break the automated

3664.02 --> 3668.64
process like the

3666.299 --> 3671.16
it's almost you could say a zombie state

3668.64 --> 3672.9
but it's not really necessarily a zombie

3671.16 --> 3674.8799999999997
State it's just that way you just go

3672.9 --> 3677.64
blah blah blah blah blah

3674.88 --> 3680.28
somebody's like in trance just rolling

3677.64 --> 3682.5
it out and complaining or whatever yeah

3680.28 --> 3684.2400000000002
if you bring up Flat Earth and they're

3682.5 --> 3686.099
not behind that that could be really

3684.24 --> 3688.7599999999998
snapping them out of it

3686.099 --> 3688.76
so yeah

3695.64 --> 3702.66
flatters can be very scary it's not even

3699.0 --> 3703.94
scary it's just like unexpected and

3702.66 --> 3707.46
like

3703.94 --> 3710.04
concentration breaking

3707.46 --> 3711.78
it's like unexpected and concentration

3710.04 --> 3714.42
breaking that's typically what it can do

3711.78 --> 3716.96
so I wouldn't call it scary I mean to

3714.42 --> 3719.4
anti-flat earthers it's scary yes

3716.96 --> 3723.059
because they can't see it

3719.4 --> 3726.119
and hey that which you don't know you

3723.059 --> 3727.6800000000003
end up fearing they can't know it

3726.119 --> 3729.599
because they got a weird blocking

3727.68 --> 3731.819
mechanism that prevents them from

3729.599 --> 3734.579
letting the information sink in well

3731.819 --> 3736.859
that means that it's a mystery and

3734.579 --> 3739.6800000000003
that's scary

3736.859 --> 3741.839
it is you might not admit that it's

3739.68 --> 3744.18
scary because that would make it that

3741.839 --> 3746.64
would make you seem weak

3744.18 --> 3748.5589999999997
but it is actually on the inside scary

3746.64 --> 3751.0789999999997
because you're dealing with things that

3748.559 --> 3752.76
you cannot assimilate you cannot

3751.079 --> 3755.059
understand

3752.76 --> 3757.5
people fear what they don't understand

3755.059 --> 3759.6600000000003
that's nature that's natural there's

3757.5 --> 3761.819
nothing you can do about that

3759.66 --> 3765.8999999999996
it's a natural side effect the

3761.819 --> 3769.619
consequence of you being incapable

3765.9 --> 3772.799
of assimilating accepting integrating

3769.619 --> 3775.1400000000003
and understanding information

3772.799 --> 3777.619
of things that we talk about as flat

3775.14 --> 3777.6189999999997
earthers

3778.5 --> 3782.18
yeah it is scary

3787.04 --> 3791.579
Mysteries are great oh really Mysteries

3789.72 --> 3794.0989999999997
are great even when you can't solve them

3791.579 --> 3796.1400000000003
because you literally cannot assimilate

3794.099 --> 3799.619
the information

3796.14 --> 3802.5789999999997
it is an unsolvable mystery great evil

3799.619 --> 3802.579
nightmare is it

3802.92 --> 3807.359
you like that a mystery that literally

3805.14 --> 3809.5989999999997
overtly cannot be solved do you like

3807.359 --> 3809.5989999999997
that

3810.24 --> 3815.0589999999997
yes

3811.619 --> 3815.059
well then you're crazy

3815.28 --> 3820.94
no wonder you call yourself evil

3817.2 --> 3820.9399999999996
nightmare you're just crazy then

3822.18 --> 3828.8999999999996
those Mysteries that cannot be solved

3826.02 --> 3831.18
like that you know that you can know

3828.9 --> 3832.38
about the mystery that it cannot be

3831.18 --> 3835.819
solved

3832.38 --> 3835.819
those are not pleasant

3836.099 --> 3842.52
those hurt typical people yeah a mystery

3839.64 --> 3844.92
that could potentially be solved that's

3842.52 --> 3847.799
thrilling because then you can try to

3844.92 --> 3850.64
figure it out but if you know something

3847.799 --> 3853.68
cannot be solved how is that thrilling

3850.64 --> 3856.22
that's just the sucks

3853.68 --> 3859.14
you're crazy

3856.22 --> 3860.8799999999997
paradoxes are great no paradoxes are

3859.14 --> 3862.98
nonsense

3860.88 --> 3864.96
you know you know the thing about a

3862.98 --> 3867.42
paradox

3864.96 --> 3871.859
the thing about a paradox is

3867.42 --> 3874.44
they don't exist that's the point the

3871.859 --> 3878.94
point about a paradox is

3874.44 --> 3882.839
it cannot exist it doesn't exist

3878.94 --> 3886.98
because it it existing would mean a

3882.839 --> 3889.859
paradox which would mean it can't be a

3886.98 --> 3890.579
paradox can't be that's the point when

3889.859 --> 3894.18
you

3890.579 --> 3897.2400000000002
bump into a paradox that means your

3894.18 --> 3898.9199999999996
entire approach the up build of the

3897.24 --> 3902.16
information the angle of approach to

3898.92 --> 3905.099
that point has been incorrect

3902.16 --> 3907.2599999999998
because a paradox cannot exist so that

3905.099 --> 3909.299
means that your entire angle of approach

3907.26 --> 3912.3590000000004
has been incorrect

3909.299 --> 3914.7599999999998
you've let false information slip into

3912.359 --> 3916.7599999999998
the construction of your reasoning to

3914.76 --> 3920.28
lead up to that point

3916.76 --> 3923.1600000000003
that's what a paradox is

3920.28 --> 3926.8190000000004
do you understand paradoxes don't exist

3923.16 --> 3928.44
in reality they only exist within our

3926.819 --> 3932.46
minds

3928.44 --> 3935.2200000000003
through language mathematics ideas how

3932.46 --> 3937.98
because how we constructed those ideas

3935.22 --> 3940.3799999999997
or that language how we used it was

3937.98 --> 3944.46
incorrect

3940.38 --> 3947.1800000000003
and that's why you lead up to a paradox

3944.46 --> 3950.66
if you bump into a paradox that means

3947.18 --> 3950.66
you were wrong

3954.0 --> 3957.96
I know you don't understand that about

3956.099 --> 3961.88
it anymore because Paradox is just

3957.96 --> 3964.799
another word like quantums so

3961.88 --> 3966.42
titillating sci-fi and you can just

3964.799 --> 3968.819
think of it whatever the [ __ ] you want

3966.42 --> 3972.54
in enterpromorphize it and so cool right

3968.819 --> 3975.0
yeah yeah but the reality is in real

3972.54 --> 3980.54
life if you bump into a paradox within

3975.0 --> 3980.54
your reasoning that means you're wrong

3982.14 --> 3985.14
foreign

3990.2 --> 3993.3199999999997
[Music]

3996.079 --> 3999.2400000000002
paradoxes can force a new way of

3998.339 --> 4000.319
thinking

3999.24 --> 4003.14
oh

4000.319 --> 4006.619
they would have to

4003.14 --> 4009.74
because only an idiot would continue or

4006.619 --> 4012.559
ignore a paradox

4009.74 --> 4014.4799999999996
yeah if you bump into a paradox you

4012.559 --> 4018.26
realize it's a paradox and then you

4014.48 --> 4020.299
ignore it to continue that same road

4018.26 --> 4022.039
you're an idiot

4020.299 --> 4026.38
and a fool

4022.039 --> 4026.38
or overtly crazy

4034.9 --> 4039.619
paradoxically it doesn't always mean

4037.16 --> 4041.359
you're no it does now you're incorrect

4039.619 --> 4045.619
and don't know where you're getting that

4041.359 --> 4048.02
but no a paradox is wrong

4045.619 --> 4050.119
if you bump into a paradox in your

4048.02 --> 4053.2599999999998
modeling

4050.119 --> 4056.2400000000002
your math

4053.26 --> 4058.3390000000004
then you were wrong there is no

4056.24 --> 4063.7599999999998
exception to that because paradoxes

4058.339 --> 4063.7599999999998
can't exist that's the point

4064.16 --> 4070.0389999999998
so I don't know why you had to like

4066.44 --> 4072.02
maybe just a little bit toward Casey but

4070.039 --> 4074.42
no

4072.02 --> 4078.44
it does always mean you are wrong

4074.42 --> 4080.0
because a paradox can't exist that's the

4078.44 --> 4082.4
point of it

4080.0 --> 4085.24
that's like the fundamental

4082.4 --> 4089.119
philosophical point

4085.24 --> 4093.7
rudimentary of a paradox is that it

4089.119 --> 4093.7000000000003
can't exist that's the point

4093.859 --> 4100.759
there's no exception there

4096.799 --> 4103.819
is an exception then it's not a paradox

4100.759 --> 4106.0
because a paradox can't exist that's the

4103.819 --> 4106.0
point

4116.96 --> 4122.719
no evil nightmare you don't understand

4120.199 --> 4123.5
what a paradox is

4122.719 --> 4126.62
thank you

4123.5 --> 4128.6
you're taking some artistic Liberty in

4126.62 --> 4133.0599999999995
the application of the word that is

4128.6 --> 4133.06
completely unjustified and incorrect

4138.259 --> 4142.9
I'm not talking about colloquial

4140.299 --> 4146.239
application popular nonsense

4142.9 --> 4148.5199999999995
technobabble application of the word

4146.239 --> 4151.879999999999
Paradox I'm talking about

4148.52 --> 4154.839000000001
actual Paradox What It Is What It stands

4151.88 --> 4158.6
for what it means yeah no exception

4154.839 --> 4160.9
you're just being a controversial or

4158.6 --> 4163.58
what do you call it

4160.9 --> 4165.62
you're just being oppositionally defiant

4163.58 --> 4167.6
is ridiculous

4165.62 --> 4169.58
who the hell in their right mind would

4167.6 --> 4172.279
argue that a paradox can physically

4169.58 --> 4175.12
exist it's ridiculous

4172.279 --> 4175.120000000001
you're an idiot

4175.279 --> 4179.319
if you actually believe that you're an

4177.02 --> 4179.319
idiot

4192.56 --> 4197.9800000000005
yeah it was like

4194.42 --> 4197.9800000000005
the paradox

4198.199 --> 4204.58
well it's a paradox within the meaning

4200.179 --> 4204.58
so whatever you're saying it's wrong

4205.4 --> 4210.259999999999
right it's not wrong as in oh you were

4208.16 --> 4213.38
lying about what you said it's just

4210.26 --> 4217.280000000001
wrong because it can't work

4213.38 --> 4219.9800000000005
yeah again it's a paradox you're wrong

4217.28 --> 4224.44
when you say that it's a paradox what

4219.98 --> 4224.44
does that mean it means you're wrong

4224.96 --> 4229.94
does it mean true or false

4227.42 --> 4232.28
means you're wrong because you're saying

4229.94 --> 4233.78
something that is a paradox so you can't

4232.28 --> 4236.12
be correct

4233.78 --> 4240.32
what does that mean you're wrong that

4236.12 --> 4242.179
was my point the build up is wrong

4240.32 --> 4244.4
yeah

4242.179 --> 4247.34
the background information that leads up

4244.4 --> 4248.54
to that conclusion I always lie has to

4247.34 --> 4251.78
be wrong

4248.54 --> 4255.44
because it's a paradox

4251.78 --> 4258.15
I mean this how is this not

4255.44 --> 4262.24
sinking in guys

4258.15 --> 4262.24
[Music]

4263.739 --> 4268.339999999999
how can you provide a great example for

4266.12 --> 4271.4
Paradox to clear up things name any

4268.34 --> 4273.7390000000005
Paradox any paradox

4271.4 --> 4276.0199999999995
I could even use the Armenian Paradox

4273.739 --> 4277.699
yeah why does the Armenian Paradox of

4276.02 --> 4281.120000000001
paradox

4277.699 --> 4283.28
because the entire premise of the

4281.12 --> 4284.9
situation

4283.28 --> 4287.719
of the Assumption of terrestrial

4284.9 --> 4291.139999999999
refraction and geometric Horizon being

4287.719 --> 4294.8
bent being displaced because of it

4291.14 --> 4296.6
it cannot be all the the preface of all

4294.8 --> 4298.159000000001
the information leading up to that

4296.6 --> 4302.0
conclusion

4298.159 --> 4304.82
end up in a paradox of origin like where

4302.0 --> 4307.52
did you get the information to

4304.82 --> 4308.239
assume how this is working you can't get

4307.52 --> 4312.5
it

4308.239 --> 4316.4
so it has to be wrong

4312.5 --> 4317.96
any Paradox is very easy

4316.4 --> 4319.5199999999995
like that

4317.96 --> 4321.5
it's always the same thing it's a

4319.52 --> 4323.2390000000005
paradox oh well that means that the

4321.5 --> 4326.3
entire preface

4323.239 --> 4329.0199999999995
it has been incorrect because a paradox

4326.3 --> 4329.02
can't exist

4329.3 --> 4332.320000000001
that's the point

4335.54 --> 4341.12
now I'm not gonna look anything up you

4338.42 --> 4343.76
can just explain them

4341.12 --> 4345.98
or stop whining about it because you're

4343.76 --> 4349.400000000001
incorrect you're just naming [ __ ] now

4345.98 --> 4351.5599999999995
you're not proving my your case

4349.4 --> 4354.799999999999
you're not proving me wrong

4351.56 --> 4358.219
everything I said is absolutely correct

4354.8 --> 4361.219
so lay down the Paradox and I'll do it

4358.219 --> 4365.6
I'll say it

4361.219 --> 4369.94
explain it I'll tell you exactly

4365.6 --> 4369.9400000000005
the situation and why it's wrong

4372.02 --> 4374.9800000000005
thank you

4377.659 --> 4381.98
something that doesn't exist still can

4379.699 --> 4384.678999999999
be yeah sure I mean information and

4381.98 --> 4386.178999999999
delusion and yeah the illusion can be

4384.679 --> 4389.38
very fascinating

4386.179 --> 4389.38
doesn't exist though

4389.54 --> 4394.46
like the actual content of the delusion

4392.12 --> 4396.739
the Illusions exist it's just that the

4394.46 --> 4399.94
what the delusions are about don't Nexus

4396.739 --> 4399.94
that's why they're delusion

4403.94 --> 4409.78
yeah and if you believe in a paradox

4406.34 --> 4409.78
then you're delusional

4409.82 --> 4414.28
because paradoxes can exist at the point

4421.1 --> 4429.14
doing nothing is exhausting Paradox no

4426.32 --> 4430.34
oh that's just very poor translation

4429.14 --> 4433.46
skills

4430.34 --> 4436.28
yeah because it's not doing nothing that

4433.46 --> 4439.219
is exhausting it is what are you going

4436.28 --> 4442.699
to do with the time while you have

4439.219 --> 4445.46
nothing to do in your head yeah it's

4442.699 --> 4447.678999999999
going to be activities that are going to

4445.46 --> 4451.219
be very exhausting

4447.679 --> 4452.719
yeah that's when you say that that's

4451.219 --> 4456.5
what you actually mean that's what

4452.719 --> 4460.04
guarantee that's what the original

4456.5 --> 4462.679
meaning of it was

4460.04 --> 4464.78
If You're Gonna Take It literal yeah

4462.679 --> 4467.179
then you end up with a paradox so why is

4464.78 --> 4469.58
it a paradox because you took it literal

4467.179 --> 4471.86
something that isn't little it's just a

4469.58 --> 4474.86
poor way of communicating yeah when I do

4471.86 --> 4478.94
nothing then I end up doing something

4474.86 --> 4480.679
not physically probably or waiting and I

4478.94 --> 4482.96
find it really exhausting guess what

4480.679 --> 4485.12
you're going to be doing something

4482.96 --> 4488.3
that's really exhausting

4485.12 --> 4491.48
so it's not literal

4488.3 --> 4494.12
it's not a paradox it's just not very

4491.48 --> 4496.759999999999
well translated

4494.12 --> 4500.5
it's a situation that has not been very

4496.76 --> 4500.5
well translated that's what it is

4509.3 --> 4513.679
the point of a paradox to make you

4510.98 --> 4515.839999999999
rethink something

4513.679 --> 4518.5
now the point of a paradox is that it's

4515.84 --> 4518.5
impossible

4520.699 --> 4527.839999999999
that's literally the point

4524.0 --> 4530.12
the point one point do you get it one

4527.84 --> 4531.81
point the point of a paradox it's

4530.12 --> 4534.839
impossible

4531.81 --> 4534.839000000001
[Music]

4544.64 --> 4550.42
feeling nothing is existing too yeah but

4547.58 --> 4550.42
it's just a lie

4551.42 --> 4556.78
feeling nothing is not exhausting that's

4553.64 --> 4556.780000000001
technically incorrect

4557.239 --> 4561.339999999999
it's not a paradox it's just wrong

4566.0 --> 4570.86
no I have not heard of all these Paradox

4568.88 --> 4573.92
you're gonna have to I don't have a

4570.86 --> 4576.5599999999995
freaking list of paradoxes in my head I

4573.92 --> 4578.3
don't need this is not a [ __ ] Mandela

4576.56 --> 4580.820000000001
effect situation okay I don't need to

4578.3 --> 4584.360000000001
collect all the paradoxes to make my

4580.82 --> 4587.0599999999995
points my point stands always I don't

4584.36 --> 4589.94
need to know all the [ __ ] paradoxes

4587.06 --> 4592.6990000000005
in order to prove that I'm correct about

4589.94 --> 4594.32
this every single time a paradox is

4592.699 --> 4596.659
going to be brought up because I am

4594.32 --> 4599.54
correct about this it always worked like

4596.659 --> 4602.48
this it always will work like this

4599.54 --> 4605.6
and people are just got infatuated on

4602.48 --> 4609.259999999999
the Sci-Fi level mathematical garbage

4605.6 --> 4612.7390000000005
level with this nonsense of this word a

4609.26 --> 4616.159000000001
paradox has one purpose

4612.739 --> 4620.62
to highlight how something cannot be

4616.159 --> 4620.62
everything else is folly

4629.36 --> 4632.0199999999995
thank you

4635.78 --> 4641.12
so you can name just write it down you

4638.719 --> 4643.34
want to share some Paradox cool write it

4641.12 --> 4646.64
down I'll analyze it and I'll tell you

4643.34 --> 4649.0
exactly what's wrong of it what's wrong

4646.64 --> 4649.0
with it

4656.54 --> 4661.46
okay Richie no problem

4658.82 --> 4664.48
yeah I thought so something that cannot

4661.46 --> 4664.4800000000005
be solved isn't really

4677.78 --> 4682.159
yeah face limited minus yeah that's too

4680.06 --> 4684.8
bad there's nothing I can do about it

4682.159 --> 4688.159
it's because of the daylight

4684.8 --> 4689.43
yeah I mean you you want this I think

4688.159 --> 4691.46
that this is good looking

4689.43 --> 4693.9800000000005
[Music]

4691.46 --> 4696.5
ugly ass light on on me like that

4693.98 --> 4698.78
this is really unpleasant

4696.5 --> 4701.42
like now I've literally like a lamp

4698.78 --> 4704.239
shining in my face blinding me

4701.42 --> 4706.4
and does this look better

4704.239 --> 4708.678999999999
I've seen all kind of weird oscillating

4706.4 --> 4711.5
[ __ ] actually happening so

4708.679 --> 4713.36
yeah let's not do that looks like I'm

4711.5 --> 4716.0
literally burning

4713.36 --> 4718.759999999999
because of this light shining on me so

4716.0 --> 4720.739
no

4718.76 --> 4724.360000000001
this is what it is this is not a studio

4720.739 --> 4724.36
this is my living room

4725.239 --> 4728.739
there's nothing I can do about it

4736.1 --> 4741.400000000001
especially okay well send me one I can't

4738.739 --> 4741.4
pay for it

4752.54 --> 4758.08
it's so very cute guys I can't afford

4755.48 --> 4758.08
any of that

4758.84 --> 4761.719
and

4760.219 --> 4764.4800000000005
dude

4761.719 --> 4766.699
why is it so important that you can see

4764.48 --> 4769.48
the lighting of my face is it really

4766.699 --> 4769.48
that important

4770.36 --> 4773.0199999999995
come on

4784.219 --> 4789.26
so yeah but it's still unpleasant even

4786.98 --> 4792.379999999999
if the flickering would go away I'll fit

4789.26 --> 4794.84
go away feed L7 I'd still have a

4792.38 --> 4797.84
freaking light shining directly in my

4794.84 --> 4799.400000000001
face no thank you I don't like to stare

4797.84 --> 4802.54
in lamps

4799.4 --> 4802.54
if you know what I mean

4809.719 --> 4816.159
looks bad when I guess

4811.94 --> 4816.159
no it gives a [ __ ]

4816.38 --> 4822.08
and the guy has a house he has a special

4819.08 --> 4824.719
room he can just use for that I don't

4822.08 --> 4826.4
yeah there's not a [ __ ] thing I can

4824.719 --> 4830.179
really do about that

4826.4 --> 4831.92
it's because of this setup yeah if I

4830.179 --> 4834.92
want like all the perfect setup then I

4831.92 --> 4837.82
have like one table in an almost empty

4834.92 --> 4841.1
room maybe some background things

4837.82 --> 4843.32
and then EV yeah there would be more

4841.1 --> 4845.02
light scattering and you would see more

4843.32 --> 4847.82
of a light in my face I wouldn't have

4845.02 --> 4849.26
the window next to me and then yeah the

4847.82 --> 4851.36
lighting will look better because it's

4849.26 --> 4852.860000000001
all like a studio yeah well good luck

4851.36 --> 4856.239
with that yeah

4852.86 --> 4856.239
I don't have that

4860.12 --> 4864.44
can provide you freaking studio quality

4863.42 --> 4867.64
okay

4864.44 --> 4867.639999999999
just get over it

4872.78 --> 4880.3
that you just haven't time change yes no

4876.56 --> 4880.3
the US went through a time change

4897.86 --> 4903.739
yeah I think it looks fine too I mean

4900.5 --> 4907.46
it's dude if it was so important then I

4903.739 --> 4909.62
would be like oh my streams are just me

4907.46 --> 4912.26
just me on camera look at me because

4909.62 --> 4915.5599999999995
it's all about I want you to see every

4912.26 --> 4919.64
detail of this beautiful man no

4915.56 --> 4921.679
I just want to be able to be seen when I

4919.64 --> 4924.02
move around when I get expressive I want

4921.679 --> 4925.46
people to be able to pick that up

4924.02 --> 4928.820000000001
right

4925.46 --> 4933.02
I I don't want like oh but you're gonna

4928.82 --> 4935.54
see my beautiful face and what is it 4K

4933.02 --> 4937.46
or whatever like dude

4935.54 --> 4940.1
why

4937.46 --> 4941.96
I'm not that pretty

4940.1 --> 4944.54
okay

4941.96 --> 4947.2390000000005
I I yeah I'm not bad looking but I'm I'm

4944.54 --> 4949.5199999999995
not like oh I'm just like the ultimate

4947.239 --> 4952.639999999999
face of beauty like why would you want

4949.52 --> 4955.540000000001
to do that like why why would you need

4952.64 --> 4955.54
to see all that

4974.8 --> 4981.34
so pretty thanks Thanksgiving

4978.38 --> 4981.34
this

4983.9 --> 4987.62
I mean like with Patricia stair for

4986.0 --> 4989.78
example I totally get it I mean she's

4987.62 --> 4991.28
actually a beautiful woman

4989.78 --> 4992.36
especially for her age it's pretty

4991.28 --> 4994.699
amazing

4992.36 --> 4997.04
and yeah she had like a really good

4994.699 --> 4999.5
lighting and all that much dude she made

4997.04 --> 5001.42
so much effort in her looks and all that

4999.5 --> 5004.179
and so like yeah that's definitely worth

5001.42 --> 5006.4
it then with me I don't know you just

5004.179 --> 5009.28
see like a me looking more like a

5006.4 --> 5011.98
Grappler or whatever I don't know

5009.28 --> 5014.44
I'm not too keen on being super super

5011.98 --> 5016.839999999999
detailed visible I don't think I'm that

5014.44 --> 5020.04
pretty up close really

5016.84 --> 5020.04
although I don't know

5022.3 --> 5026.8
I just don't really like having

5024.219 --> 5029.56
spotlights in my face I much more like

5026.8 --> 5033.54
the daylight I just like having daylight

5029.56 --> 5033.54
there better for my eyes

5042.76 --> 5047.860000000001
oh come on steamy travel yeah

5046.3 --> 5049.719
it's just that I can't really do

5047.86 --> 5052.239
anything about it I don't have the money

5049.719 --> 5053.44
it's not like oh well I have a thousand

5052.239 --> 5056.44
bucks

5053.44 --> 5058.12
for reserve for whatever investment like

5056.44 --> 5062.379999999999
and then it's like oh yeah it could have

5058.12 --> 5066.159
better lighting like I I need pants

5062.38 --> 5069.36
maybe I should get new pants first

5066.159 --> 5069.36
before I think about

5069.58 --> 5074.26
investing more in

5072.52 --> 5075.76
my setup here

5074.26 --> 5077.9800000000005
and I mean yeah there's going to be

5075.76 --> 5080.320000000001
plenty to invest in I mean I I really

5077.98 --> 5083.98
want a new monitor I mean

5080.32 --> 5084.88
been wanting that for half a for half a

5083.98 --> 5086.799999999999
decade

5084.88 --> 5089.86
but

5086.8 --> 5091.84
just it's not really gonna happen so I

5089.86 --> 5094.599999999999
don't really like thinking about oh

5091.84 --> 5097.900000000001
expanding that yeah because I never can

5094.6 --> 5101.4400000000005
[ __ ] pay for it and I hate planning

5097.9 --> 5106.0599999999995
things that I can never pay for I hate

5101.44 --> 5109.0599999999995
it I hate doing that

5106.06 --> 5110.7390000000005
makes me feel really poor and really

5109.06 --> 5113.1990000000005
stupid

5110.739 --> 5115.36
don't do that

5113.199 --> 5118.32
I'll think about something when I can

5115.36 --> 5118.32
freaking pay for it

5119.92 --> 5124.179
[Music]

5122.44 --> 5127.0599999999995
right so if you really want something

5124.179 --> 5129.46
you're gonna have to send it to me

5127.06 --> 5132.54
no then I'll take it

5129.46 --> 5132.54
I'll apply it

5139.44 --> 5144.159
yeah Richard G I mean everybody's coming

5142.3 --> 5147.4800000000005
here for their own reasons

5144.159 --> 5147.48
I'm not angry with

5148.12 --> 5151.9
a steamy Trail I really appreciate

5150.04 --> 5153.58
steamy traveler but he's sometimes it

5151.9 --> 5156.099999999999
just like approaches me like I'm some

5153.58 --> 5158.139
businessman like with these options I'm

5156.1 --> 5160.42
not

5158.139 --> 5162.58
I don't have that maneuverability I wish

5160.42 --> 5164.32
I did it would be pretty cool

5162.58 --> 5166.36
don't

5164.32 --> 5169.12
don't though

5166.36 --> 5171.759999999999
so it's kind of just like oh look at all

5169.12 --> 5175.0599999999995
the good things you could do if you had

5171.76 --> 5176.9800000000005
money I hate it I hate that

5175.06 --> 5179.080000000001
I hate that

5176.98 --> 5181.12
I don't want to be reminded of all these

5179.08 --> 5184.26
things I could potentially do if I had

5181.12 --> 5184.26
money because I don't

5200.679 --> 5204.2390000000005
right yeah thanks Richie

5209.8 --> 5217.42
again I wouldn't mind some lighting

5213.84 --> 5220.42
things more studio quality set up for my

5217.42 --> 5224.02
visuals if that was achievable in some

5220.42 --> 5226.0
way it's just I don't have any kind of

5224.02 --> 5229.120000000001
priority to that

5226.0 --> 5231.96
or capability to make such an investment

5229.12 --> 5231.96
it's just

5235.48 --> 5238.599999999999
yeah

5236.44 --> 5241.48
I mean they're gonna have to get a lot

5238.6 --> 5242.5
more income to start moving in that

5241.48 --> 5244.718999999999
direction

5242.5 --> 5246.82
and like I gotta get freaking new

5244.719 --> 5249.179
clothes first man I

5246.82 --> 5249.179
just

5249.76 --> 5254.5
I've been walking around with holes in

5251.56 --> 5256.719
my pants for years

5254.5 --> 5259.3
I think that's a little higher priority

5256.719 --> 5261.78
than a lamp

5259.3 --> 5261.78
anyway

5262.6 --> 5266.639
why am I mean I'm not mean

5267.699 --> 5272.58
just getting real getting real about it

5273.4 --> 5277.16
anyway I think yeah I'm gonna take a two

5275.199 --> 5278.678999999999
minute break

5277.16 --> 5281.5199999999995
[Music]

5278.679 --> 5281.52
oh

5282.03 --> 5285.09
[Music]

5329.98 --> 5332.4
foreign

5370.0 --> 5373.0
foreign

5376.64 --> 5379.729
[Music]

5389.88 --> 5397.2390000000005
yeah but no it's very funny skeptic

5394.659 --> 5399.699
it's not just whole I mean

5397.239 --> 5401.5
it's a miracle still in one part really

5399.699 --> 5404.199
at this point

5401.5 --> 5407.26
it's been patched up so many times it's

5404.199 --> 5411.178999999999
like one third of the entire fans is

5407.26 --> 5411.179
patch it's ridiculous

5411.94 --> 5416.199
so I just need something I need a new

5414.34 --> 5420.6
pair of pants and I needed to be the

5416.199 --> 5420.599999999999
right fabric it's gonna cost some

5421.36 --> 5426.099999999999
I mean there's a good chance that just

5423.52 --> 5430.2390000000005
the fabric I need

5426.1 --> 5433.860000000001
for two pair of pants could be like 200

5430.239 --> 5433.86
Euros or maybe more

5433.96 --> 5437.82
if it even still exists

5443.62 --> 5447.94
it might be less though I don't know I'm

5446.199 --> 5450.4
gonna have to find it I just know that

5447.94 --> 5453.04
at the time when I was getting it and

5450.4 --> 5455.92
that's like a long time ago it really

5453.04 --> 5458.5
was like one of the most expensive

5455.92 --> 5462.3
Fabrics they even had

5458.5 --> 5462.3
bar like the

5462.58 --> 5468.239
like theater curtains or something just

5465.28 --> 5468.239
super thick

5468.34 --> 5470.88
so

5474.159 --> 5477.78
what I mean it's well worth it though

5481.48 --> 5489.339999999999
gotta pay your Visa no problem skeptic

5486.219 --> 5493.199
already supported me so thanks for that

5489.34 --> 5493.1990000000005
you make sure you get out of debt

5493.659 --> 5497.879999999999
in the meantime I'll try to stay out of

5495.639 --> 5497.88
debt

5502.179 --> 5504.659
foreign

5516.04 --> 5520.48
what material is it

5518.08 --> 5523.179
fabric

5520.48 --> 5526.739
it's just a certain type of fabric it

5523.179 --> 5526.7390000000005
has a like a name

5527.98 --> 5534.159
I think it was called work wear

5531.28 --> 5536.86
but I mean yeah I don't even know how

5534.159 --> 5539.5599999999995
quickly the types of fabrics I don't

5536.86 --> 5541.9
understand that industry much so

5539.56 --> 5544.4800000000005
it might simply be completely abandoned

5541.9 --> 5547.719
or renamed I have to figure it out I

5544.48 --> 5551.5599999999995
basically I have to have somebody

5547.719 --> 5553.719
hopefully like an expert accompany me

5551.56 --> 5555.639
too like the warehouse because I

5553.719 --> 5558.159
couldn't even get in there

5555.639 --> 5560.02
you have to have like a membership

5558.159 --> 5563.199
thing

5560.02 --> 5566.639
and then help me find it

5563.199 --> 5566.638999999999
that's how we did it last time

5572.08 --> 5575.0199999999995
because I don't think I could even get

5574.179 --> 5578.4400000000005
there

5575.02 --> 5580.96
without a car and I don't have a car

5578.44 --> 5583.839999999999
and even if I got there alone like I'd

5580.96 --> 5588.699
be completely lost

5583.84 --> 5590.92
because that place is freaking huge

5588.699 --> 5594.699
and there's so many fabrics and I know

5590.92 --> 5596.9800000000005
so little about it really I'd be very

5594.699 --> 5599.259999999999
easy for me to go in there and then just

5596.98 --> 5602.138999999999
accidentally pick the wrong thing and

5599.26 --> 5604.320000000001
then get super screwed

5602.139 --> 5608.28
spending all that money

5604.32 --> 5608.28
I don't want that to happen

5608.5 --> 5615.46
right that's what happened the last time

5612.88 --> 5618.639
and I got it from the market just on my

5615.46 --> 5618.639
own so

5633.639 --> 5636.3
anyway

5638.32 --> 5645.46
right I could potentially try something

5642.639 --> 5647.7390000000005
like in May or well in the summer

5645.46 --> 5650.92
because I do get like a summer bonus

5647.739 --> 5653.678999999999
from my welfare

5650.92 --> 5658.3
well I could potentially use that to

5653.679 --> 5661.659
attempt to at least attain the fabric

5658.3 --> 5663.639
and then once I have it then I know I

5661.659 --> 5666.159
could have my pants and then I might

5663.639 --> 5669.719
even like do a GoFundMe like hey

5666.159 --> 5669.719
I need to pay a tailor

5670.48 --> 5676.799999999999
go my GoFundMe and I can get my pants

5673.3 --> 5676.8
because I already got the fabric

5677.38 --> 5681.46
right but it's all dependent on if it's

5679.6 --> 5684.6
even going to be possible whether I find

5681.46 --> 5684.6
the right Fabric or not

5685.0 --> 5687.54
anyway

5687.699 --> 5690.9
sounding kind of gay

5695.5 --> 5701.76
I don't know I I take Taylor's Taylor

5698.56 --> 5701.76
stuff very serious

5715.6 --> 5720.4800000000005
custom-made clothing common where you

5717.88 --> 5720.4800000000005
live no

5734.86 --> 5738.4
okay

5736.719 --> 5742.38
sure

5738.4 --> 5744.759999999999
yeah we get some energy

5742.38 --> 5747.219
money from the government because it's

5744.76 --> 5750.04
all out of control but I mean I actually

5747.219 --> 5753.58
need that money for bills

5750.04 --> 5755.26
I mean because yeah so

5753.58 --> 5757.6
I'm not gonna like

5755.26 --> 5760.02
have Surplus because of that except

5757.6 --> 5760.02
happy

5774.04 --> 5779.199
but anyway we'll see we'll see what

5776.199 --> 5781.0599999999995
happens I just want new pants because it

5779.199 --> 5783.04
sucks

5781.06 --> 5785.139
walking around with these at this point

5783.04 --> 5788.5199999999995
especially when it's like raining and

5785.139 --> 5788.52
[ __ ] it's really annoying

5804.4 --> 5808.98
okay Georgetown hey to each their own

5806.8 --> 5808.9800000000005
man

5809.86 --> 5812.339999999999
okay

5815.98 --> 5820.9
you know what it is with me I really

5818.32 --> 5823.12
don't like new clothes all the time I

5820.9 --> 5826.179
hate that I like to wear the same

5823.12 --> 5828.58
freaking thing every [ __ ] day of my

5826.179 --> 5831.1
entire life that's the kind of guy I am

5828.58 --> 5834.04
if you want that then you have to have

5831.1 --> 5836.38
ultimate pants that like never wear out

5834.04 --> 5840.1
right

5836.38 --> 5842.92
I don't go secondhand clothes stuff and

5840.1 --> 5845.320000000001
then like get new ones every half year I

5842.92 --> 5849.78
would not

5845.32 --> 5849.78
I would not like that at all

5855.219 --> 5859.179
yeah it does

5872.4 --> 5875.49
[Music]

5882.34 --> 5886.06
okay dresses

5884.32 --> 5887.739
all right well if you're into that

5886.06 --> 5890.820000000001
that's cool

5887.739 --> 5890.82
no issue with that

5898.36 --> 5902.16
[Music]

5902.5 --> 5908.199
I mean if it gets bad enough and like my

5904.84 --> 5911.7390000000005
pants really rips off or whatever

5908.199 --> 5914.678999999999
like it becomes unusable then yeah I

5911.739 --> 5917.739
might just as well like try to get some

5914.679 --> 5919.78
kind of secondhand pair of pants but I

5917.739 --> 5921.04
mean that's not gonna make me freaking

5919.78 --> 5924.0
happy

5921.04 --> 5924.0
at all

5929.139 --> 5935.1990000000005
it's gonna basically in a way

5932.02 --> 5937.06
yeah break myself image

5935.199 --> 5939.04
you could say

5937.06 --> 5940.54
so

5939.04 --> 5943.54
I'm just not

5940.54 --> 5945.639
I don't see that as a real solution it's

5943.54 --> 5947.26
just all temporary [ __ ] and then once

5945.639 --> 5949.0
you start that then everything's just

5947.26 --> 5950.38
going to be temporary [ __ ] and before

5949.0 --> 5952.719
you know it you're completely

5950.38 --> 5955.719
dilapidated

5952.719 --> 5955.719
so

5973.3 --> 5977.28
in what before I do it

5977.5 --> 5982.92
oh you got some storm

5980.199 --> 5982.919999999999
whoa

5985.6 --> 5988.9800000000005
flood coming out here

6001.94 --> 6008.58
that reichi look the problem is

6006.36 --> 6011.88
I'm a guy

6008.58 --> 6013.8
I don't like shopping for clothes

6011.88 --> 6017.639
unless there's a woman with me because

6013.8 --> 6018.62
then I can feel like she's making me

6017.639 --> 6020.34
yeah

6018.62 --> 6021.9
[Music]

6020.34 --> 6023.6990000000005
as a

6021.9 --> 6026.638999999999
as a stance

6023.699 --> 6028.919999999999
towards other people

6026.639 --> 6031.62
I just find

6028.92 --> 6035.78
shopping for clothes really awkward

6031.62 --> 6035.78
without a woman being present I did

6036.3 --> 6041.219
really

6038.58 --> 6043.139
and it's also well in the past when when

6041.219 --> 6044.639
I would have a girlfriend I'd be like

6043.139 --> 6047.88
okay we're gonna go clothes shopping

6044.639 --> 6050.46
right now it's just because like oh

6047.88 --> 6052.9800000000005
finally I got a woman so I can do

6050.46 --> 6055.32
clothes shopping

6052.98 --> 6059.48
I'm not even joking it's really like

6055.32 --> 6059.48
that I just find it so awkward

6067.8 --> 6074.1
and they also usually just know to find

6070.98 --> 6075.78
things much better with it because I'm

6074.1 --> 6077.46
just like oh it's a clothing store and

6075.78 --> 6080.04
like I'll walk around and be like I

6077.46 --> 6081.659
can't find it you walk past it like four

6080.04 --> 6083.699
times like what

6081.659 --> 6087.299999999999
that oh

6083.699 --> 6088.62
oh so I just I'm not good at clothes

6087.3 --> 6091.6990000000005
shopping

6088.62 --> 6091.699
and just not

6094.26 --> 6098.76
and like most like

6096.42 --> 6099.84
even when we do when in the past when we

6098.76 --> 6101.88
did

6099.84 --> 6104.159000000001
it would typically happen that it's like

6101.88 --> 6106.5
oh look at that and I'm like oh no no

6104.159 --> 6109.08
way and then she would like to no just

6106.5 --> 6110.76
try it on I'd never tell myself just try

6109.08 --> 6113.04
it and try it out it's like whoa hey

6110.76 --> 6116.219
that actually looks really good

6113.04 --> 6120.0
so I need a woman to make me put it on

6116.219 --> 6123.8
because I refuse I'm like

6120.0 --> 6123.8
I don't want it

6125.48 --> 6130.739
so yeah

6128.4 --> 6133.32
but I mean I'm really thankful afterward

6130.739 --> 6135.44
if I actually got good clothing out of

6133.32 --> 6135.44
it

6140.82 --> 6146.4
right but it's also because women just

6143.179 --> 6149.4800000000005
see clothes around me that I just can't

6146.4 --> 6149.48
see it like that

6150.0 --> 6154.739
so they'll see things and they're like

6152.28 --> 6158.46
oh put that on it I'm like oh no way

6154.739 --> 6160.799999999999
like oh no way man and then I try it on

6158.46 --> 6162.78
it's like what whoa that's totally not

6160.8 --> 6164.28
what I expected that actually looks

6162.78 --> 6167.639
interesting

6164.28 --> 6171.38
like without a woman there to push me to

6167.639 --> 6171.38
do that it that would never happen

6177.42 --> 6182.58
and to be fair that's literally also

6180.239 --> 6185.339999999999
that used to be with my mom I guess I'm

6182.58 --> 6186.54
just like that I'm a guy and needs a

6185.34 --> 6189.92
woman

6186.54 --> 6189.92
when they go clothes shopping

6197.3 --> 6203.2390000000005
so dear

6199.739 --> 6203.239
oh Daryl they're right here

6210.98 --> 6217.08
yeah that one by the way was a bit of an

6214.38 --> 6221.52
issue too with my ex is that

6217.08 --> 6223.92
she didn't like that she didn't like

6221.52 --> 6227.360000000001
having to be there for me with clothes

6223.92 --> 6227.36
shopping she didn't like that

6227.76 --> 6231.119000000001
that was kind of disappointing because I

6229.86 --> 6234.119
really needed that

6231.119 --> 6237.239
well even at the time it didn't really I

6234.119 --> 6240.619
mean at most we like did some shoe

6237.239 --> 6243.599999999999
shopping like I needed new shoes

6240.619 --> 6248.42
I can be very picky and even a bit whiny

6243.6 --> 6248.42
about it and she did not appreciate that

6248.88 --> 6254.52
when she's like a shopping cart that

6251.52 --> 6257.46
just likes to go around and just like

6254.52 --> 6260.360000000001
basically go on autopilot and just try

6257.46 --> 6260.36
things out and

6260.58 --> 6265.619
she doesn't like to be complainy and all

6263.1 --> 6268.38
that around clothes

6265.619 --> 6270.96
she's very much like a more into zen

6268.38 --> 6272.82
mode when she's around clothing and

6270.96 --> 6275.88
clothes shopping and I am much more like

6272.82 --> 6278.94
a little bit I get all grapply and like

6275.88 --> 6281.28
over concerned

6278.94 --> 6284.299999999999
and she found that very annoying which

6281.28 --> 6284.3
is understandable

6293.88 --> 6298.28
yeah you have that issue too Richie all

6296.1 --> 6298.280000000001
right

6314.219 --> 6319.9800000000005
well Richie maybe one day the money

6317.82 --> 6322.259999999999
comes rolling or something

6319.98 --> 6324.299999999999
we could do a close shopping date

6322.26 --> 6326.52
together or something in Amsterdam what

6324.3 --> 6329.46
about that

6326.52 --> 6330.92
whether we need some cash for that first

6329.46 --> 6333.36
though

6330.92 --> 6335.76
not telling that you'd have to deliver

6333.36 --> 6338.5199999999995
that but just in general that would be

6335.76 --> 6340.9400000000005
kind of cool to do

6338.52 --> 6340.9400000000005
right

6352.98 --> 6360.659
the globe has no pants okay that's funny

6357.0 --> 6363.54
Godzilla but not that's not gonna be the

6360.659 --> 6366.199
title for today's show

6363.54 --> 6366.199
uh

6381.36 --> 6385.739
I don't know what I'm gonna call Today

6383.219 --> 6387.4800000000005
Show it certainly didn't roll out what I

6385.739 --> 6389.82
expected although it's been very nice

6387.48 --> 6391.739
and more personal I thought it was gonna

6389.82 --> 6393.36
like really talk about Christ and all

6391.739 --> 6396.299999999999
that and God

6393.36 --> 6399.119
getting really serious but

6396.3 --> 6402.1990000000005
then that didn't happen

6399.119 --> 6402.199
I'm okay with that

6408.98 --> 6413.239
hmm okay LSG

6421.739 --> 6425.879999999999
you need the cash to get up yeah I would

6423.719 --> 6428.58
need cash for it to literally go there

6425.88 --> 6430.92
transport and

6428.58 --> 6434.0
yeah

6430.92 --> 6434.0
a bit of a budget

6435.3 --> 6439.139
so yeah I don't know if that's gonna

6436.739 --> 6440.699
happen anytime soon but I mean I I would

6439.139 --> 6442.32
look forward to doing something like

6440.699 --> 6443.699
that and would be cool to do it with

6442.32 --> 6445.5199999999995
somebody that I actually know from

6443.699 --> 6449.9
online like raichi

6445.52 --> 6449.900000000001
it would be cool to meet you a person

6449.94 --> 6453.98
and yeah you're not too far away in

6451.8 --> 6453.9800000000005
England

6469.139 --> 6471.86
foreign

6478.86 --> 6486.36
yeah steamy traveler but not yet

6483.3 --> 6487.4400000000005
I was actually planning on that for my

6486.36 --> 6489.78
pants

6487.44 --> 6491.58
but I really I gotta secure the fabric

6489.78 --> 6493.5
first

6491.58 --> 6496.4
I gotta know that it's still possible

6493.5 --> 6496.4
Right

6500.1 --> 6503.76
so I gotta get go after that it's just

6502.08 --> 6505.32
that the weather's been kind of shitty

6503.76 --> 6508.139
and yeah

6505.32 --> 6509.28
because I gotta go out and just go to

6508.139 --> 6510.900000000001
like the

6509.28 --> 6512.94
like a tailor shop

6510.9 --> 6515.099999999999
for knitting and all that and and just

6512.94 --> 6517.0199999999995
ask about like hey I'm looking for this

6515.1 --> 6520.92
fabric

6517.02 --> 6524.1
could you check at this location if that

6520.92 --> 6527.58
exists and maybe we could like I could

6524.1 --> 6531.6
hire somebody to go with me with a car

6527.58 --> 6534.619
there and try to find this fabric like

6531.6 --> 6534.619000000001
I'll pay them

6535.08 --> 6542.42
like not a giant amount or anything but

6538.02 --> 6542.42
I I don't know we whatever could work

6542.58 --> 6547.26
so you could just get somebody that

6544.98 --> 6549.718999999999
really knows their way around there and

6547.26 --> 6554.159000000001
car transport and then yeah of course

6549.719 --> 6557.699
money but I would aim on using the

6554.159 --> 6559.92
summer vacation money that I get in late

6557.699 --> 6562.98
May for that

6559.92 --> 6567.02
so I'm basically gonna probably try this

6562.98 --> 6567.0199999999995
summer too to get my new pants

6573.84 --> 6578.6
maybe I'm gonna call this fancy pass

6575.94 --> 6578.599999999999
part two

6583.56 --> 6587.6990000000005
but yeah not Globe I mean this had

6586.139 --> 6589.619
nothing to do with the glow we didn't

6587.699 --> 6593.36
even talk about that

6589.619 --> 6593.36
I mean paradoxes but

6597.01 --> 6603.360000000001
[Music]

6599.82 --> 6607.58
or I could make it extra silly

6603.36 --> 6607.58
call it the Fancy Pants paradox

6608.219 --> 6612.86
which is misleading but it is funny

6610.5 --> 6612.86
though

6618.719 --> 6622.92
foreign I wonder if from everything

6621.3 --> 6626.719
that's been talked about there could be

6622.92 --> 6626.719
a fancy pants Paradox derive

6632.699 --> 6636.96
whatever

6634.08 --> 6639.719
I'm talking a lot about Fancy Pants

6636.96 --> 6643.28
and we talked about paradoxes so yeah

6639.719 --> 6643.28
this is what it's going to be called

6649.219 --> 6657.36
doordash delivered to kill you

6653.639 --> 6657.36
then DUIs

6657.42 --> 6661.82
yeah skeptic take it easy though

6673.199 --> 6677.9
what do you guys think about my titles

6675.06 --> 6677.900000000001
that good or what

6685.76 --> 6691.679
and maybe there is like a fancy pants

6688.8 --> 6692.639
Paradox I mean if you if you tie it in

6691.679 --> 6695.159
with

6692.639 --> 6698.28
I think

6695.159 --> 6699.719
like the whole well why the word Fancy

6698.28 --> 6702.0599999999995
Pants is funny it's because Owen

6699.719 --> 6704.639
Benjamin brought that force of Fancy

6702.06 --> 6707.1
Pants and lollipops is like part of like

6704.639 --> 6709.1990000000005
the money selling out to the system with

6707.1 --> 6712.139
principles right well I'm definitely not

6709.199 --> 6715.199
selling out to the system to get my

6712.139 --> 6718.679
fancy pens though I'm actually literally

6715.199 --> 6722.638999999999
I want fancy pants but not to be gay and

6718.679 --> 6726.42
flashy and but because I just want to

6722.639 --> 6728.76
have the right stuff for me

6726.42 --> 6730.38
it's not going to be like all flamboyant

6728.76 --> 6734.119000000001
or anything it's actually it's just

6730.38 --> 6738.86
black pants it's just black that's it

6734.119 --> 6738.86
but they are fancy right

6739.02 --> 6743.9400000000005
but maybe there is a fancy pants Paradox

6741.42 --> 6746.52
it's like why do the the Fancy Pants

6743.94 --> 6748.739
lollipop people from Owen Benjamin get

6746.52 --> 6750.42
the fancy pants

6748.739 --> 6753.0
it's because they want something out of

6750.42 --> 6755.119
it but maybe there is some paradoxical

6753.0 --> 6758.54
nature to that

6755.119 --> 6758.54
metaphysically that is

6759.84 --> 6764.88
but I'll have to figure that out by

6762.119 --> 6768.179
thinking about it or forget about it and

6764.88 --> 6770.46
just start a new subject the next day

6768.179 --> 6772.92
hey that flat fellow good to see you

6770.46 --> 6775.94
you're a bit late I was actually about

6772.92 --> 6775.9400000000005
to round out the show

6792.06 --> 6795.92
I already played yeah it was fun

6796.32 --> 6802.86
and we talked about paradoxes

6799.92 --> 6806.1
with evil nightmare here

6802.86 --> 6808.679
a bit of a back and forth

6806.1 --> 6810.900000000001
because he insisted that paradoxes some

6808.679 --> 6812.58
of them did exist and I'm like no the

6810.9 --> 6814.739
whole point of a paradox is that they

6812.58 --> 6817.739
don't exist that you know that if it is

6814.739 --> 6819.54
a paradox that your entire preface your

6817.739 --> 6822.178999999999
entire angle of approach in that

6819.54 --> 6825.3
reasoning has been incorrect

6822.179 --> 6827.58
because you can't end up in a paradox in

6825.3 --> 6830.1
things that are real those paradoxes

6827.58 --> 6831.6
don't exist that's their point so it's a

6830.1 --> 6834.659000000001
big part of the discussion and then we

6831.6 --> 6838.139
went on to clothing and I talked a bit

6834.659 --> 6840.0
about like my horseback riding past

6838.139 --> 6842.1
maybe I could fit that in title

6840.0 --> 6844.92
comparing horseback riding to skating

6842.1 --> 6848.04
and how I didn't skate but I horseback

6844.92 --> 6851.84
rode and it was very they had the same

6848.04 --> 6851.84
things same risks

6852.119 --> 6856.38
compared that and then we ended up

6854.159 --> 6857.699
talking about clothing in my fancy pants

6856.38 --> 6860.84
again

6857.699 --> 6860.839999999999
so that's the show

6870.54 --> 6874.92
they were great yeah but you did

6872.52 --> 6878.88
actually somebody did say that they

6874.92 --> 6881.159
what's its 4kc and I remember

6878.88 --> 6884.42
that anyway

6881.159 --> 6884.42
which one of you said that

6894.0 --> 6898.199
sounds like an interesting show yeah it

6896.04 --> 6901.139
was pretty fluid a lot of people got in

6898.199 --> 6903.719
a chat right away so yeah it was like

6901.139 --> 6905.639
nice and fluid today I appreciate that I

6903.719 --> 6908.76
appreciate people actually showing up

6905.639 --> 6910.7390000000005
early in the show

6908.76 --> 6913.38
so then I don't have like a moment where

6910.739 --> 6916.44
I get like uh where is everybody why is

6913.38 --> 6919.46
there 12 minute silence again damn it

6916.44 --> 6919.46
it's annoying

6922.699 --> 6928.159
Jehovah's Witness magic what no that's

6925.679 --> 6931.139
not Jehovah's Witness this is the Mormon

6928.159 --> 6932.46
Mormons have magic underwear for

6931.139 --> 6937.28
baptisms

6932.46 --> 6937.28
in the temple interplanetary gay

6937.739 --> 6941.48
who's trying to troll me probably

6961.88 --> 6968.04
no it's just pants

6965.159 --> 6969.599999999999
just pants that I think are very fancy

6968.04 --> 6971.34
they are will be more expensive they

6969.6 --> 6973.92
will be tailor-made they will be made of

6971.34 --> 6977.9400000000005
a very special fabric but they will look

6973.92 --> 6981.06
just like black pants I mean it's not

6977.94 --> 6983.82
they're technically not fancy as or

6981.06 --> 6986.46
flashy and maybe a fancy like how the

6983.82 --> 6989.42
hell do you even use the word fancy

6986.46 --> 6989.42
it's confusing

6990.96 --> 6997.7390000000005
so the nut flamboyant and not flashy but

6993.659 --> 7001.36
they are like adorable high quality

6997.739 --> 7001.36
can last a lifetime

7003.619 --> 7008.54
and I call them Fancy Pants I guess

7006.26 --> 7010.52
there's a bit of self mockery in

7008.54 --> 7014.5
reference to Owen Benjamin talking about

7010.52 --> 7014.5
Fancy Pants and lollipops in the past

7018.02 --> 7021.860000000001
right but I would never like sell out to

7020.36 --> 7024.619
some stupid

7021.86 --> 7028.639
narrative [ __ ] just so I could

7024.619 --> 7030.259999999999
afford my new fancy pants like and that

7028.639 --> 7032.0
is what really what the whole Fancy

7030.26 --> 7034.219
Pants lollipops thing was about about

7032.0 --> 7036.86
that selling out to just get that and

7034.219 --> 7040.159
that's not gonna happen no I'm very

7036.86 --> 7045.32
happily happily walking around in worn

7040.159 --> 7048.44
pants for several years now so foreign

7045.32 --> 7050.719
yeah it's not that

7048.44 --> 7053.178999999999

yeah before I go I'm not gonna like

7113.78 --> 7117.679
expand the show much more but there was

7115.46 --> 7120.679
this video and I would like to share it

7117.679 --> 7123.08
it's that was also yesterday night

7120.679 --> 7126.679
cleat they forgot about this but what's

7123.08 --> 7129.139
on Infowars and sadly Flynn like former

7126.679 --> 7132.8
General Flynn some of you might have

7129.139 --> 7136.54
heard of it in this video and almost

7132.8 --> 7136.54
exactly the 10 minute mark

7137.3 --> 7144.619000000001
he just drops on Alex but in his

7141.199 --> 7147.0199999999995
emergency broadcast announcement that

7144.619 --> 7149.139
yeah tactical nuclear weapons don't

7147.02 --> 7153.5
actually exist

7149.139 --> 7156.8
boom just like that and and moves on

7153.5 --> 7159.139
I I wanted you guys to check that out

7156.8 --> 7161.96
it's very interesting and he's I think

7159.139 --> 7164.719
he's done something similar before and

7161.96 --> 7166.88
that guy's very interesting

7164.719 --> 7170.0
he like sneaks through

7166.88 --> 7171.679
good pieces of information like but

7170.0 --> 7173.599
occultly it's fascinating there's some

7171.679 --> 7175.34
other people over at Infowars or

7173.599 --> 7176.119000000001
associate with it that also seem to do

7175.34 --> 7178.6990000000005
that

7176.119 --> 7181.339999999999
and of course like Greg Reese is even

7178.699 --> 7184.46
like openly a flat earther

7181.34 --> 7186.26
so you guys have told me a while ago but

7184.46 --> 7187.4
yeah this happened and I wanted you to

7186.26 --> 7190.280000000001
check that out

7187.4 --> 7192.32
right but I am gonna run out that or I

7190.28 --> 7197.259999999999
have rounded out so again

7192.32 --> 7197.259999999999
until the next video keep it flat

7197.59 --> 7228.869000000001
