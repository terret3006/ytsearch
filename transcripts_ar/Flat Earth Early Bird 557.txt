71.78 --> 80.45
weather again is just very hot it's not

73.91 --> 81.83
windy though it's just hot and yeah kind

80.45 --> 84.22
of moist and there's been a lot of

81.83 --> 87.47
chemtrails up there or whatever that is

84.22 --> 91.88
it's yeah it's turning into a gray soup

87.47 --> 93.979
so if this continues I don't know maybe

91.88 --> 97.49
it's gonna like rain somewhere in the

93.979 --> 103.729
evening I'm not sure but it just seems

97.49 --> 105.979
very moist a very warm with just very

103.729 --> 108.8
little wind and it's just so moist it

105.979 --> 115.599
just feels like it's it it could lead to

108.8 --> 115.599
a storm somewhere anyway

117.219 --> 126.55999999999999
hmm so yeah sorry I got stuck I had a

123.729 --> 133.269
yeah elaborate conversation over skype

126.56 --> 135.65
with rest I read before the show yeah

133.269 --> 137.66
we're trying to get this ordering

135.65 --> 141.47
situation going on just like there may

137.66 --> 144.53
be problems with my phone or it seems

141.47 --> 147.56
like it just can't even connect to any

144.53 --> 149.48
type of phone number outside of the

147.56 --> 151.43
Netherlands or Europe but it's just

149.48 --> 155.39
weird so that's just things I have to

151.43 --> 160.01000000000002
get in order and get some stuff ordered

155.39 --> 165.76899999999998
cuz I should have everything I got need

160.01 --> 168.26
to accomplish that also it seems like

165.769 --> 172.64000000000001
the tobacco order of the leaves is

168.26 --> 180.26
probably delayed or just got stuck

172.64 --> 187.29899999999998
somewhere so it's a bit messy trying to

180.26 --> 192.10899999999998
work it out so let's use in chat

187.299 --> 196.22
Mandy Young was first kamikaze Gilmore

192.109 --> 198.169
Oprah muku said eat at Cosentino alone

196.22 --> 205.01
eel stopping traffic him arrest I had

198.169 --> 210.16000000000003
the ice already bare a creation bear and

205.01 --> 213.88899999999998
I killed a hope Liverpool FC fan

210.16 --> 216.31
George Sandford a gem yeah good to see

213.889 --> 216.31
you all

218.81 --> 232.23
if your federal refund I have no idea

221.85 --> 237.42
what that means but anyway it's gonna

232.23 --> 239.91
work out it has to work out it's just

237.42 --> 244.04999999999998
taking and it's like a challenge it

239.91 --> 246.56
seems all of us it's ridiculous but I

244.05 --> 246.56
got there

251.34 --> 264.31
tax return so what was I doing yesterday

262.57 --> 267.58
well at least I didn't go to bat to mate

264.31 --> 270.55
I didn't drink too much either so I'm

267.58 --> 272.16999999999996
kind of glad about that because I don't

270.55 --> 276.93
know I think I've been overdoing it a

272.17 --> 276.93
little on the line in the last week

277.8 --> 284.23
which oddly enough I did did feel better

282.13 --> 289.63
afterward then when I would just be

284.23 --> 290.71000000000004
drinking beer so I don't know but yeah

289.63 --> 293.98
it didn't make it too late

290.71 --> 298.33
also the I got caught up watching series

293.98 --> 301.99
on Netflix again and yeah don't know how

298.33 --> 305.26
that escaped my my eye before but I

301.99 --> 307.98
checked it out it's the space for series

305.26 --> 311.59
it's been out for a while and I've been

307.98 --> 313.96000000000004
yeah people talked about it to me but I

311.59 --> 318.25
was just very rejectionist at first

313.96 --> 322.02
hearing that but it's pretty bizarre

318.25 --> 325.36
series there's a lot in there including

322.02 --> 327.49
like this weird Senator or what is it

325.36 --> 330.19
congressmen hearing and this guy saying

327.49 --> 332.26
that the old man saying the earth is

330.19 --> 342.91
flat and then later saying and it's

332.26 --> 348.78999999999996
rectangular that was like wow oh but

342.91 --> 352.69
yeah that series is special I didn't

348.79 --> 355.5
expect it to be like it is it is

352.69 --> 355.5
interesting

357.62 --> 360.689
[Music]

360.85 --> 367.27000000000004
like yeah the first two episodes were

363.35 --> 371.78000000000003
just like mind-blowing really thought I

367.27 --> 373.96999999999997
think I'm now at like Episode six just

371.78 --> 378.04999999999995
going through it but the theme seems

373.97 --> 381.08000000000004
clear it's all about like how long can

378.05 --> 384.05
the government cover up the [ __ ] and

381.08 --> 385.43
like they have to do this but it's all

384.05 --> 387.77000000000004
not really working out but they're

385.43 --> 391.1
expecting to do it like it's a smart

387.77 --> 393.68
trick that they pulled with this because

391.1 --> 395.36
at the same time yeah you could see it

393.68 --> 397.61
from another perspective saying that

395.36 --> 400.61
yeah this is just literally all fakery

397.61 --> 401.87
but the people want it so they have to

400.61 --> 404.69
give it even though it doesn't really

401.87 --> 409.04
exist you could see it like that as well

404.69 --> 413.75
and I thought yeah that that's new it's

409.04 --> 416.3
like a double layer within the entire

413.75 --> 418.88
series and you don't necessarily see

416.3 --> 423.89
that the second layer I thought it was

418.88 --> 427.90999999999997
interesting bursting out into laughter

423.89 --> 432.46999999999997
at Glover's during Effie debate is key

427.91 --> 434.99
to a great day yeah

432.47 --> 437.75
why I see I did do that a couple of

434.99 --> 441.40000000000003
times yesterday all the debates cousin

437.75 --> 441.4
was just getting so silly

444.68 --> 448.479
I'll see what happens today

460.22 --> 463.63000000000005
okay hm

470.14 --> 473.96
yeah I was

472.16 --> 475.79
you know the whole laughing thing it was

473.96 --> 479.06
more out of frustration than anything

475.79 --> 485.06
because I like I wanted to kind of like

479.06 --> 487.16
I guess soothe the situation and like

485.06 --> 489.89
try to get to add because I have talked

487.16 --> 493.04
to him one-on-one before I do get how he

489.89 --> 495.40999999999997
works he was just so out of control of

493.04 --> 499.16
the situation and then he turns into

495.41 --> 501.20000000000005
just an idiot troll and yeah I was

499.16 --> 503.72
laughing kind of out of frustration

501.2 --> 506.17
about like how this situation was out of

503.72 --> 509.42
control even though I kind of wanted to

506.17 --> 514.479
work on it but yeah Nathan was just not

509.42 --> 514.479
letting that happen and yeah

521.6 --> 530.63
yes yes long stony silence and then

526.43 --> 532.43
suddenly when you complain like why why

530.63 --> 537.31
the stony silence and then he says I

532.43 --> 537.31
can't get a word out it's just bizarre

537.7 --> 544.1600000000001
but at the same time Skype was probably

540.68 --> 545.7099999999999
or this Gordon was probably also acting

544.16 --> 548.48
up a little anyway

545.71 --> 551.96
Google is acting up a lot recently

548.48 --> 554.54
there's all times where I just want to

551.96 --> 556.1
say things and I've just noticed that

554.54 --> 558.05
people are talking over me and then

556.1 --> 561.53
realized that nobody heard me

558.05 --> 563.93
just out of nowhere it's like yeah I

561.53 --> 565.0
just get muted just like that don't even

563.93 --> 568.6999999999999
realize it

565.0 --> 571.03
very annoying Google very freaking

568.7 --> 571.0300000000001
annoying

581.65 --> 590.42
no add face hello to my chat don't don't

587.29 --> 594.5
leave them alone you know it's tough

590.42 --> 598.2199999999999
enough being a baller as it is but yeah

594.5 --> 601.28
the thing is that we don't need to think

598.22 --> 603.6800000000001
that long about our answers because we

601.28 --> 607.3399999999999
got it already right in front of us the

603.68 --> 609.9799999999999
whole package the whole pattern hundreds

607.34 --> 616.76
of tests hundreds of responses from

609.98 --> 619.25
ballers we got it we remember [ __ ] and

616.76 --> 621.38
when we say something like at the

619.25 --> 625.51
beginning of the show we remember it

621.38 --> 628.73
because the context is important so yeah

625.51 --> 630.89
that's actually normal it's normal for

628.73 --> 634.54
people when they are engaging in things

630.89 --> 637.73
that they remember things about it

634.54 --> 642.5899999999999
otherwise like you're literally wasting

637.73 --> 644.5600000000001
your own time and everybody else's so

642.59 --> 647.87
maybe you should do something about that

644.56 --> 652.52
you know I find it really kind of odd

647.87 --> 655.64
because I remember how for example 20

652.52 --> 657.89
years ago I was there was like this

655.64 --> 659.24
ratchet is going around remember maybe

657.89 --> 661.34
you you've heard of it

659.24 --> 664.64
well maybe not you're probably a bit too

661.34 --> 667.49
young for that about stoners people that

664.64 --> 669.3199999999999
smoke cannabis and then lose track of

667.49 --> 671.39
what's going on you know that was like

669.32 --> 676.4300000000001
oh don't be a STONER

671.39 --> 679.06
well I smoked cannabis like I smoked

676.43 --> 681.68
cannabis right before the show start and

679.06 --> 683.5699999999999
now I do have my moments where I

681.68 --> 685.91
certainly like have trouble getting on

683.57 --> 688.73
the rails like like what was I talking

685.91 --> 691.4
about again you know that that does

688.73 --> 693.8000000000001
happen a little but eventually I do

691.4 --> 698.39
catch on again my memory is still

693.8 --> 701.87
working so yeah I smoked yet my memory

698.39 --> 704.96
works just fine I don't know if you

701.87 --> 707.0
smoke but your memory does not seem to

704.96 --> 709.24
work fine so I wonder what's going on

707.0 --> 709.24
there

717.4 --> 725.59
yeah that's interesting that you would

720.85 --> 729.19
know about that at face so maybe you do

725.59 --> 731.71
have some influences concerning that

729.19 --> 736.5300000000001
that's but I do know yes that's right

731.71 --> 740.8000000000001
sativa sativa is not very good is very

736.53 --> 744.88
psychoactive type of cannabis and it can

740.8 --> 748.0
alter your your consciousness also in a

744.88 --> 752.37
bad way if you overdo it I personally

748.0 --> 752.37
prefer indica strains every single time

762.8 --> 766.059
Oh Kido

770.98 --> 778.21
we don't have those kind of lunatics

773.54 --> 778.2099999999999
here at Liverpool FC fan

793.08 --> 800.779
that's ridiculous Missouri bear that is

797.519 --> 800.779
absolutely ridiculous

830.74 --> 841.75
I just repeat what I said when I did it

839.44 --> 846.82
underneath an oakley show and in this

841.75 --> 849.72
court well if you're already noticing

846.82 --> 855.61
that we're kind of repeating things then

849.72 --> 857.83
why don't you actually address them why

855.61 --> 859.69
don't you try to figure out like where's

857.83 --> 861.5200000000001
where are these thoughts coming from

859.69 --> 863.0500000000001
what is the train of thought behind it

861.52 --> 865.8299999999999
where are we building upon why aren't

863.05 --> 870.42
you trying to figure it out like we

865.83 --> 873.13
figure it out like the entire

870.42 --> 875.3199999999999
heliocentric train of thought how that

873.13 --> 877.57
works the dream about it you know it's

875.32 --> 880.589
one of my specialties explain it many

877.57 --> 880.589
time I was stuck right there

896.55 --> 900.14
no I don't have a car

906.57 --> 909.629
[Music]

912.43 --> 920.319
Magpies are frolicking out there oh yes

917.569 --> 922.67
that I glow by I definitely do I

920.319 --> 925.31
definitely do understand the

922.67 --> 928.279
heliocentric model in every freaking

925.31 --> 930.649
aspect about it including the

928.279 --> 932.54
mathematical nonsense I just don't know

930.649 --> 934.009
the numbers by heart but I know the

932.54 --> 937.61
structure I know where it's coming from

934.009 --> 941.029
I don't know where why it is there I

937.61 --> 946.2090000000001
know why dark matter is there I know why

941.029 --> 946.209
I know it all oh yes I do

951.6 --> 958.8290000000001
so why ask questions about well maybe

956.149 --> 962.519
maybe we're asking questions about it

958.829 --> 965.2199999999999
not because we're asking clarifications

962.519 --> 968.61
about something we don't know but maybe

965.22 --> 972.24
we're asking you questions to make you

968.61 --> 974.94
think about certain aspects of the

972.24 --> 978.1800000000001
heliocentric model and the claims that

974.94 --> 979.589
are made that's why we're asking

978.18 --> 984.29
questions about it

979.589 --> 989.1
because we spotted errors mistakes and

984.29 --> 991.8
broken logic circular arguments all that

989.1 --> 997.35
that's why we ask questions about that

991.8 --> 1000.8
to Globus to try to make them ask that

997.35 --> 1005.529
question to themselves about their model

1000.8 --> 1005.529
as well that's why we do that

1012.07 --> 1015.219
[Music]

1020.73 --> 1030.63
now yep now that's not what happens at

1026.01 --> 1033.87
phrase no no now you try to clarify

1030.63 --> 1036.209
right but the thing is what you're

1033.87 --> 1039.51
clarifying usually isn't an answer to

1036.209 --> 1041.97
the actual question you're usually the

1039.51 --> 1044.1299999999999
one actually straw Manning the point in

1041.97 --> 1047.31
moving on to another subject or drawing

1044.13 --> 1049.6200000000001
in another claim that also requires

1047.31 --> 1052.23
proof to back it up and that you can

1049.62 --> 1056.58
provide for as well and then you move on

1052.23 --> 1060.48
to the next claim - straw man that straw

1056.58 --> 1064.07
man that's really how that works and

1060.48 --> 1064.07
that's what keeps happening

1065.92 --> 1069.14
[Music]

1074.11 --> 1079.5
[Music]

1076.41 --> 1081.8100000000002
now that's that's [ __ ] circular

1079.5 --> 1084.86
reason deaf Oh globe if there were

1081.81 --> 1088.2
errors they wouldn't be in the model ah

1084.86 --> 1091.05
yeah well they are they there there

1088.2 --> 1092.55
there we're pointing him out yeah the

1091.05 --> 1095.25
models wrong that's right

1092.55 --> 1096.78
oh it shouldn't be should it well yeah

1095.25 --> 1099.78
that's right it shouldn't be because

1096.78 --> 1103.7
it's wrong we're pointing at it it's

1099.78 --> 1107.76
incorrect that's right

1103.7 --> 1109.29
defo globe you don't need to provide

1107.76 --> 1110.97
proof well you do because you're making

1109.29 --> 1112.86
the claims you're making the claims the

1110.97 --> 1116.31
earth is a globe you're making the

1112.86 --> 1117.9299999999998
claims it has curvature you're making

1116.31 --> 1123.3
the claims there's an outer space vacuum

1117.93 --> 1125.22
out there enveloping the world yeah

1123.3 --> 1128.46
you're making all these claims every

1125.22 --> 1131.28
time you draw all that in you do you

1128.46 --> 1133.3500000000001
know you do you're taking it as a base

1131.28 --> 1136.35
assumption all these elements to them

1133.35 --> 1138.33
you say they are proven well if you're

1136.35 --> 1141.1499999999999
gonna claim that then you're gonna have

1138.33 --> 1144.3899999999999
to provide the evidence to back that

1141.15 --> 1146.6100000000001
claim up and yeah when you try to do

1144.39 --> 1149.8100000000002
that you have to abide by certain rules

1146.61 --> 1153.2099999999998
of logic and academics

1149.81 --> 1155.61
yeah and if you don't understand it

1153.21 --> 1158.1000000000001
because you've wasted your time just

1155.61 --> 1160.3799999999999
fantasizing about philosophical garbage

1158.1 --> 1162.8999999999999
nonsense all day that's been told to you

1160.38 --> 1164.5800000000002
through a popular television that that's

1162.9 --> 1167.13
all right because all science is all

1164.58 --> 1169.62
about philosophy is just about the train

1167.13 --> 1172.98
of thought and yeah you don't always

1169.62 --> 1174.78
have to very manipulate an independent

1172.98 --> 1176.04
variable because sometimes you can't and

1174.78 --> 1177.66
yeah you still want to expand the

1176.04 --> 1180.5
knowledge right yeah it's all very nice

1177.66 --> 1184.23
but that simply means you're not

1180.5 --> 1186.35
utilizing science and information in the

1184.23 --> 1191.15
correct way and you're not actually

1186.35 --> 1194.37
providing good evidence for your claim

1191.15 --> 1200.18
evidence that can actually prove the

1194.37 --> 1200.1799999999998
claim no you don't that's the problem

1200.999 --> 1205.6490000000001
just keeps on going everyday and every

1203.639 --> 1207.2389999999998
time the answers are the same and every

1205.649 --> 1208.799
time they're rebuttals to those answers

1207.239 --> 1210.8690000000001
are the same because we know those

1208.799 --> 1215.099
answers and we know that they're

1210.869 --> 1216.9589999999998
incorrect and we can explain why and we

1215.099 --> 1219.629
do every time and then you complain to

1216.959 --> 1221.759
us you always say this you always say

1219.629 --> 1225.6589999999999
that yeah that's right that's called a

1221.759 --> 1227.849
rebuttal it's called a rebuttal to your

1225.659 --> 1229.499
suppose an explanation that is supposed

1227.849 --> 1233.609
to provide the evidence for your claim

1229.499 --> 1235.469
and then we rebut that and I know it's

1233.609 --> 1238.4689999999998
not very inconvenient well maybe you

1235.469 --> 1241.1090000000002
should actually think about what the

1238.469 --> 1243.809
claim is for real and then get a little

1241.109 --> 1245.999
bit more real about how to prove it

1243.809 --> 1247.4089999999999
you know maybe listen to the

1245.999 --> 1249.119
instructions we gave you about the

1247.409 --> 1252.8090000000002
scientific method how that actually

1249.119 --> 1256.9489999999998
works that could help a lot but no no

1252.809 --> 1260.6589999999999
you'd prefer complaining complaining and

1256.949 --> 1260.659
just moving on to the next subject

1266.24 --> 1271.23
yeah no you're just being a really

1268.77 --> 1274.799
pathetic liar at face it's really

1271.23 --> 1276.75
disgusting I kick you in the shins if

1274.799 --> 1279.72
you were next to me it's like really

1276.75 --> 1281.94
disgusting shut the [ __ ] up you're a

1279.72 --> 1284.88
liar and you're pathetic

1281.94 --> 1287.01
troll attempts to Gaslight us with

1284.88 --> 1289.409
everything and basically this explained

1287.01 --> 1291.39
right and it's actually heartfelt I'm

1289.409 --> 1294.9
actually telling you because I do want

1291.39 --> 1297.5900000000001
you to get it to move on but no no you

1294.9 --> 1301.3700000000001
had to flip that all inside out

1297.59 --> 1303.9289999999999
summarize it and say you're doing there

1301.37 --> 1304.4089999999999
didn't you add you just had to do it

1303.929 --> 1307.0800000000002
didn't you

1304.409 --> 1309.8990000000001
it's really [ __ ] pathetic and sad

1307.08 --> 1313.08
it's really disgusting should be ashamed

1309.899 --> 1315.4699999999998
of yourself buddy it's a really [ __ ]

1313.08 --> 1315.47
sad

1320.96 --> 1327.53
yeah that's bound to happen didn't meet

1325.26 --> 1332.73
that by the way I was leaving him out

1327.53 --> 1334.8799999999999
Karen to do this but it is it is really

1332.73 --> 1334.88
disgusting

1336.44 --> 1341.52
yeah know that that's the funny thing

1339.12 --> 1344.9399999999998
isn't it death for globe no no no you

1341.52 --> 1349.08
are lying the believing part is not to

1344.94 --> 1353.76
lie you know the lie comes when you

1349.08 --> 1356.1899999999998
actually respond to inquiries that try

1353.76 --> 1360.96
to point out how it's wrong and then you

1356.19 --> 1364.14
lie in that moment to bypass the issue

1360.96 --> 1366.24
of your lie being questioned which you

1364.14 --> 1368.01
believe in yeah the believing part is

1366.24 --> 1371.82
not the problem the problem is that you

1368.01 --> 1376.83
actively lie to protect your belief and

1371.82 --> 1379.49
that is lying and it starts with lying

1376.83 --> 1379.49
to yourself

1380.74 --> 1386.48
[Music]

1390.02 --> 1399.33
[Music]

1394.94 --> 1401.19
yeah well therefore globe how do we lie

1399.33 --> 1402.96
when your argument is a straw man well

1401.19 --> 1407.46
that's a lie right there cuz it's not a

1402.96 --> 1409.44
straw man you don't even understand what

1407.46 --> 1412.97
these things are at this point you're

1409.44 --> 1416.7
just so confused by getting bashed with

1412.97 --> 1419.76
yeah well defined criticisms and

1416.7 --> 1421.68
pointing out mistakes technicals all the

1419.76 --> 1424.35
time and you're just so confusing that

1421.68 --> 1426.5700000000002
at this point you're just throwing these

1424.35 --> 1429.48
words back at us like you know your

1426.57 --> 1432.21
straw man you don't even [ __ ] know

1429.48 --> 1433.5
what that means you [ __ ] you literally

1432.21 --> 1435.33
don't even know what it means you're

1433.5 --> 1436.88
just throwing back a word that you don't

1435.33 --> 1442.59
know what it is

1436.88 --> 1447.0600000000002
we're not straw Manning models right the

1442.59 --> 1449.9599999999998
model is defined it's official we've

1447.06 --> 1453.57
read it you can look it up yourself and

1449.96 --> 1455.76
when ballers are asked define their

1453.57 --> 1457.9199999999998
model that's exactly what they do they

1455.76 --> 1460.92
look it up they look it up on Wikipedia

1457.92 --> 1465.8100000000002
they look it up for Google yeah so it's

1460.92 --> 1468.48
defined we flat earthers use that data

1465.81 --> 1471.4199999999998
that is defined about your model and

1468.48 --> 1474.24
then address the issues that's not a

1471.42 --> 1478.0500000000002
straw man that's called addressing the

1474.24 --> 1483.69
issues a straw man is when you make

1478.05 --> 1487.56
claims about a model whatever that are

1483.69 --> 1490.47
not actually present in the model that

1487.56 --> 1492.27
are not part of the model so for example

1490.47 --> 1494.48
if I would say all that stupid

1492.27 --> 1497.61
heliocentric model is just so dumb

1494.48 --> 1500.72
because they don't even take into

1497.61 --> 1504.33
account that there's like three moons

1500.72 --> 1506.22
right now that would be a bit of a

1504.33 --> 1509.1499999999999
ridiculous but it that would technically

1506.22 --> 1513.09
be a straw man we would be trying to

1509.15 --> 1515.19
ridicule or whatever you disproved the

1513.09 --> 1516.84
model by pointing out something that's

1515.19 --> 1520.98
not part of the model

1516.84 --> 1524.1599999999999
that's a straw man okay that's actually

1520.98 --> 1526.08
is from then we don't do that we just

1524.16 --> 1529.71
point out the fact

1526.08 --> 1532.82
that you take for granted that you look

1529.71 --> 1534.9
up when you try to defend your model

1532.82 --> 1537.3899999999999
that's what we're pointing out that's

1534.9 --> 1542.3700000000001
not a straw man that's exactly the

1537.39 --> 1544.47
opposite of a straw man we created a

1542.37 --> 1547.11
straw man for gravity oh really

1544.47 --> 1549.57
we created the straw man for gravity we

1547.11 --> 1551.8799999999999
didn't just go by the official standard

1549.57 --> 1553.4099999999999
the official standard where gravity is

1551.88 --> 1556.88
not a force even though you could think

1553.41 --> 1559.3200000000002
about it as a force but it's not right

1556.88 --> 1561.5700000000002
seems something that you can't really

1559.32 --> 1563.34
handle that concept that just because

1561.57 --> 1565.11
you're allowed to think about things in

1563.34 --> 1567.9599999999998
certain ways that doesn't mean that they

1565.11 --> 1569.82
are in certain ways it's just a thought

1567.96 --> 1572.91
experiment it doesn't mean anything

1569.82 --> 1574.59
empirically right so yeah we do

1572.91 --> 1576.8400000000001
understand that and we understand where

1574.59 --> 1581.3999999999999
that's coming from historically we got

1576.84 --> 1585.4499999999998
it all but at all in order all the

1581.4 --> 1587.5800000000002
details yeah we do we do know it it's

1585.45 --> 1589.74
not a straw man that's exactly what is

1587.58 --> 1591.75
going on right now that's what they will

1589.74 --> 1598.11
tell you at the University that's what

1591.75 --> 1602.22
the books will tell you Edie yeah it's

1598.11 --> 1604.4399999999998
so dumb you don't even know you're

1602.22 --> 1607.95
around teachings you're just trusting

1604.44 --> 1609.929
that it must be right and everything

1607.95 --> 1611.55
that opposes it must be done well guess

1609.929 --> 1613.8000000000002
what you're the one that's [ __ ] dumb

1611.55 --> 1616.1399999999999
because you don't even know what it is

1613.8 --> 1619.35
you're defending you literally don't

1616.14 --> 1621.5400000000002
know what the details are and then when

1619.35 --> 1624.27
somebody points them out to you you tell

1621.54 --> 1626.61
them they are straw Manning it no no

1624.27 --> 1629.24
we're just pointing out the facts it's

1626.61 --> 1629.24
the facts

1635.57 --> 1640.62
it's really nice calling way to force

1638.46 --> 1643.25
but that's not what we were referring to

1640.62 --> 1645.3899999999999
were we we were talking about gravity

1643.25 --> 1649.04
you brought up gravity

1645.39 --> 1655.0800000000002
see now you're literally straw Manning

1649.04 --> 1661.6499999999999
yourself and you are literally straw

1655.08 --> 1664.62
Manning yourself do you see that you

1661.65 --> 1667.8000000000002
bring up gravity right you bring up

1664.62 --> 1670.1399999999999
gravity you tella me us that we're

1667.8 --> 1673.59
strong manning gravity and we don't

1670.14 --> 1675.96
understand it then you understand that

1673.59 --> 1678.9299999999998
you bring it up it's not a force but

1675.96 --> 1682.92
that weight is you're literally straw

1678.93 --> 1686.19
Manning yourself it's just this is

1682.92 --> 1688.5900000000001
getting absurd it's like you should be

1686.19 --> 1691.17
part of space are you a part of space

1688.59 --> 1695.52
for sad are you literally in a

1691.17 --> 1698.8100000000002
representative of space force because

1695.52 --> 1705.27
you would fit right into that series man

1698.81 --> 1708.6599999999999
you're completely deluded [ __ ] you're

1705.27 --> 1711.51
a deluded [ __ ] and you haven't even

1708.66 --> 1713.28
read your own [ __ ] books you don't

1711.51 --> 1717.77
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

1713.28 --> 1717.77
you're an absolute [ __ ] Edie

1721.65 --> 1727.1100000000001
so absurd like he's shoving it to us

1724.98 --> 1728.97
like gravity is not a force it's yes

1727.11 --> 1733.1699999999998
Marty weight is the force Oh

1728.97 --> 1735.24
so why do people still say that gravity

1733.17 --> 1738.6000000000001
is a force and it's mass being attracted

1735.24 --> 1740.96
to mass see is your Pierce right I think

1738.6 --> 1745.35
I've caught you saying that at times

1740.96 --> 1748.95
right so wait wait how's this weight

1745.35 --> 1751.32
then supposed to replace gravity being

1748.95 --> 1752.76
weight being attracted by weight or

1751.32 --> 1754.74
something like that

1752.76 --> 1757.97
doesn't really make a whole lot of sense

1754.74 --> 1757.97
after that point you know

1782.87 --> 1787.1
yeah please be careful I'm kind of

1785.51 --> 1788.54
engaging with the globus or if you're

1787.1 --> 1792.1399999999999
gonna cut time them out that I'm not

1788.54 --> 1796.43
gonna have anything stupid to yell at so

1792.14 --> 1809.69
please please don't be trigger-happy

1796.43 --> 1815.3
Karen B C see you now ad is an advocate

1809.69 --> 1820.79
for the stupid he's literally advocating

1815.3 --> 1823.1
for this stupid I need I never see poop

1820.79 --> 1825.6499999999999
people are not scientists so they don't

1823.1 --> 1827.48
go by exact definitions the majority

1825.65 --> 1830.15
goes by what the majority calls it

1827.48 --> 1832.73
something the majority is wrong like in

1830.15 --> 1834.23
this case so and so are you though

1832.73 --> 1837.8600000000001
that's not even an argument

1834.23 --> 1839.72
it's just ending up with no you it's not

1837.86 --> 1841.82
actually a part of the whole reasoning

1839.72 --> 1843.77
thing you put down there but yeah you

1841.82 --> 1847.22
are literally advocating for the

1843.77 --> 1850.03
ignorant masses you're a bumbling

1847.22 --> 1850.03
buffoon

1855.789 --> 1862.779
like this you serious this can't be real

1860.649 --> 1866.85
man if this is really who you are that's

1862.779 --> 1872.019
I wouldn't want to be you

1866.85 --> 1874.869
you must be absurdly miserable like who

1872.019 --> 1877.029
could ever have respect for anybody that

1874.869 --> 1879.1899999999998
could just blurt out this level of

1877.029 --> 1889.989
nonsense and still be arrogant about it

1879.19 --> 1893.769
it's just mind-boggling man no yeah but

1889.989 --> 1895.749
the thing is we do understand what the

1893.769 --> 1897.489
model says about gravity and no it's not

1895.749 --> 1900.519
a force outs the bending of space-time

1897.489 --> 1904.409
right and then you just insert wait

1900.519 --> 1908.95
well where's that coming from can I see

1904.409 --> 1911.8590000000002
citation perhaps and yeah from an actual

1908.95 --> 1914.44
I know scientist physicist would be cool

1911.859 --> 1917.9089999999999
you know where I say like I don't know

1914.44 --> 1921.0990000000002
great not gravity right now wait because

1917.909 --> 1925.8990000000001
I'm pretty sure that weight is an

1921.099 --> 1928.45
extrapolated piece of data it's not

1925.899 --> 1937.5089999999998
really a force it's kind of something

1928.45 --> 1940.349
that that comes out of that yeah yeah

1937.509 --> 1943.349

really disgusting after a while and

2011.78 --> 2020.03
you're really a disgusting guy that that

what you deserve when you do this [ __ ]

2022.09 --> 2032.33
to this level that disgusting and it's

bad that there are people out there that

will misbehave so badly that apparently

2037.49 --> 2043.88
hate themselves to such absurd levels

2040.22 --> 2046.67
that they'll display disgusting behavior

2043.88 --> 2048.9500000000003
with no limit until people will

2046.67 --> 2051.79
literally end up beating him up and

2048.95 --> 2053.8889999999997
he'll probably even feel good about it

2051.79 --> 2057.77
you'll love it

stupid ball ok the earth doesn't matter

2161.26 --> 2167.38
it's that he is a being a disgusting

about it to himself and to everyone even

though everyone can see it and feels

yeah unless you're I kind of put a name

2249.07 --> 2255.9
to that I will be very much inclined to

2252.37 --> 2259.5299999999997
take that as if you were telling me that

2255.9 --> 2259.53
so were you

2275.589 --> 2278.7889999999998
better speak up

2289.73 --> 2293.47
better speak up read Sabbath

2306.849 --> 2313.829
five four three two one

2314.819 --> 2327.099
and you're banned yeah I have seen you

2323.259 --> 2329.709
hanging around for a while and yeah now

2327.099 --> 2331.6600000000003
it reveals like why wife debate hey now

2329.709 --> 2333.759
it's just sitting there so they can wait

2331.66 --> 2336.0989999999997
for some kind of moment of heated 'no

2333.759 --> 2339.13
sand then just insert their little dick

2336.099 --> 2341.559
moves - no no no no your layer and you

2339.13 --> 2347.4990000000003
did that is that what you've been

2341.559 --> 2350.7290000000003
hanging around for it's like this weird

2347.499 --> 2355.749
floating turrets that just stick to you

2350.729 --> 2359.859
though did don't do anything until they

2355.749 --> 2363.359
just have to show their ugly faces for

2359.859 --> 2363.359
real what they're really doing there

2367.799 --> 2371.4
it's the same person

2375.27 --> 2380.54
oh wait note

2391.47 --> 2397.81
yeah I'm ready you know yeah people like

2394.15 --> 2399.85
Edie they really piss me off and he

2397.81 --> 2403.0
pisses me off even more because he's

2399.85 --> 2407.58
Dutch and like I know he actually is

2403.0 --> 2413.35
present clear it close to me and it just

2407.58 --> 2415.45
yeah it's not good it's not good that

2413.35 --> 2417.49
people like that exist and that they're

2415.45 --> 2419.1
stuck there and that people just allow

2417.49 --> 2423.54
that to happen

2419.1 --> 2423.54
it's it's really bad

2431.89 --> 2438.609
well good servant maybe you should stick

2434.71 --> 2440.589
to spelling correctly more you being

2438.609 --> 2443.71
very sloppy on the spelling I don't like

2440.589 --> 2446.099
that at all and I was talking about

2443.71 --> 2446.099
Eddie

2493.03 --> 2495.84
right

2501.059 --> 2506.8190000000004
yes stupid wait is a forest [ __ ]

2503.819 --> 2509.189
just tires me out every time that

2506.819 --> 2512.0389999999998
nonsense is brought up like okay ways a

2509.189 --> 2516.0589999999997
force then can you tell me how much a

2512.039 --> 2518.329
helium balloon weighs in the air weigh

2516.059 --> 2522.329
it

2518.329 --> 2526.799
so does it weigh like minus a hundred

2522.329 --> 2529.6400000000003
grams how does that work could it be

2526.799 --> 2534.199
that it doesn't really work it's only in

2529.64 --> 2537.0589999999997
mathematical extract an extrapolation of

2534.199 --> 2539.189
effects that are happening right it's

2537.059 --> 2541.9190000000003
not really a force it's an extract of

2539.189 --> 2544.3489999999997
mathematical extrapolation because it

2541.919 --> 2546.9
doesn't always work out like wait only

2544.349 --> 2548.489
works out in certain conditions and yeah

2546.9 --> 2554.359
if those conditions aren't met then

2548.489 --> 2554.359
doesn't classify doesn't work out

2605.759 --> 2611.499

yeah sure no it doesn't stallion

2724.78 --> 2731.8500000000004
don't get yourself banned now for saying

2727.57 --> 2731.8500000000004
something that's too stupid even for you

2746.24 --> 2752.75
here that guy's stallion is actually

2748.91 --> 2756.41
having the gall to forward a mechanical

2752.75 --> 2759.92
man-made device as proof that the Earth

2756.41 --> 2770.56
rotates its I have no words for that

2853.99 --> 2858.3999999999996
have been hanging around they're

2855.16 --> 2861.49
doubling down why are you doubling down

2858.4 --> 2863.77
on something so stupid you can't be

2861.49 --> 2868.45
seriously thinking that some mechanical

2863.77 --> 2871.45
device a man-made device that it that

2868.45 --> 2874.54
man-made device is a proof that the

earth spins it can't be [ __ ] serious

man this is this is getting worse

2879.54 --> 2887.05
like I can't maintain a globe or in

2884.2 --> 2890.62
panel in in chat cooperation if you guys

2887.05 --> 2893.59
get this stupid then you're all gonna

2890.62 --> 2896.5899999999997
end up getting banned again you gotta

2893.59 --> 2900.34
move with us you gotta grow you got a

2896.59 --> 2903.84
let thing sinking yeah I'm not gonna

2900.34 --> 2907.6200000000003
allow you to become even more ignorant

2928.15 --> 2931.34

2950.349 --> 2957.76
no that's not what you said before you

2952.819 --> 2957.7599999999998
said rotation of the earth of movement

2984.64 --> 2993.08
so it's just a gyroscope is that it's

2990.8 --> 2997.2200000000003
still in a t12 it's it's just a

2993.08 --> 2999.3199999999997
gyroscope a gyroscopes that's just going

2997.22 --> 3002.56
to be sitting there it's going to be

2999.32 --> 3005.1090000000004
used to orientate yourself when you have

3002.56 --> 3008.17
no horizon in the sky to do that right

3005.109 --> 3010.14
so how is that proving the motion of the

3008.17 --> 3014.13
earth is it doing that by you

3010.14 --> 3016.21
presupposing that it is correcting its

3014.13 --> 3025.71
motion based on the spin of the earth

3016.21 --> 3025.71
that you are presuming is it it's just

3035.15 --> 3039.27
yeah I'm getting flustered here and is

3037.56 --> 3041.81
not from smoking because I haven't

3039.27 --> 3047.099
smoked in over an hour

3041.81 --> 3050.0299999999997
it's just this tingly feeling of like I

3047.099 --> 3052.4100000000003
don't know maybe it's just me

3050.03 --> 3054.869
empathizing getting like the empathic

3052.41 --> 3060.72
resonance of literally people's brain

3054.869 --> 3065.4300000000003
cells bursting like I'm feeling that

3060.72 --> 3067.8799999999997
happening right now in the chat with

3065.43 --> 3067.8799999999997
these people

3068.51 --> 3074.76
can you feel it too it's like this sigh

3071.369 --> 3077.07
of relief it's like this sigh of relief

3074.76 --> 3081.869
you're losing your mind it's just going

3077.07 --> 3084.3300000000004
away there's peace you don't have to

3081.869 --> 3086.52
worry about it anymore you don't have to

3084.33 --> 3089.13
figure it out anymore it's not gonna

3086.52 --> 3091.77
start making any more sense after that

3089.13 --> 3094.8900000000003
point if you keep on doubling down that

3091.77 --> 3096.24
it must be right which is the core thing

3094.89 --> 3097.92
that's happening really and that is

3096.24 --> 3100.9799999999996
causing that tension that will

3097.92 --> 3103.9500000000003
eventually lead to all those synapse is

3100.98 --> 3106.17
bursting and basically burning out

3103.95 --> 3107.3999999999996
that's what that leads to eventually

3106.17 --> 3110.4900000000002
more and more and more

3107.4 --> 3116.1600000000003
that's how ballers over time become more

3110.49 --> 3119.0699999999997
stupid more stupid and even more more

3116.16 --> 3120.839
short-sighted more on the edge they

3119.07 --> 3124.19
think while they overlook everything

3120.839 --> 3128.31
that's valuable they completely miss out

3124.19 --> 3133.5
because they think they're edgy and at

3128.31 --> 3136.91
the mid laser Hawk God so laser

3133.5 --> 3142.109
gyroscope is it so the the the the

3136.91 --> 3146.16
rotation of the laser the 15-degree

3142.109 --> 3150.0299999999997
drift of the laser the light the light

3146.16 --> 3151.77
right in a gyroscope like device right

3150.03 --> 3154.7000000000003
that the house that's supposed to prove

3151.77 --> 3159.29
the earth spin that the laser the light

3154.7 --> 3163.3799999999997
rotated 50 degrees by the way

3159.29 --> 3166.529
perpendicular to the z axis

3163.38 --> 3168.2400000000002
right that's not that the way that's

3166.529 --> 3170.43
supposed to happen if the earth were

3168.24 --> 3173.25
spinning right pretty sure about that

3170.43 --> 3175.23
and the regular gyroscope didn't do that

3173.25 --> 3180.75
the actual physical gyroscope it didn't

3175.23 --> 3184.47
drift so how does a regular gyroscope

3180.75 --> 3186.93
physical one not drifting but a laser a

3184.47 --> 3190.259
light gyroscope drifting how does that

3186.93 --> 3192.3289999999997
prove the rotation of the earth it's

3190.259 --> 3194.2690000000002
like how many times do ballers have to

3192.329 --> 3206.2400000000002
bring this up

3194.269 --> 3209.97
it's beyond [ __ ] that's right Kari

3206.24 --> 3212.609
and Charon be was there okay you believe

3209.97 --> 3216.3289999999997
it it's two years later and they're

3212.609 --> 3219.269
still putting that [ __ ] out they're

3216.329 --> 3222.569
still echoing it and it's so dumb it is

3219.269 --> 3228.1189999999997
just beyond [ __ ] it's like three

3222.569 --> 3230.759
tiers of cascade idiocy just being stuck

3228.119 --> 3232.0190000000002
together like this [ __ ] painting of

3230.759 --> 3234.539
information that's just completely

3232.019 --> 3238.529
idiotic and it just keeps on persisting

3234.539 --> 3241.4100000000003
people keep saying it the laser

3238.529 --> 3243.869
gyroscope disprove the rotation of the

3241.41 --> 3245.49
earth because I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] it

3243.869 --> 3250.4300000000003
doesn't actually think about what he's

3245.49 --> 3253.7099999999996
saying the Flat Earth is just stupid

3250.43 --> 3259.069
they just prove the rotation of the

3253.71 --> 3259.069
earth through the laser drift

3270.77 --> 3276.68
oh yeah yeah gyrocompass is definitely

3273.53 --> 3280.13
mechanical the ring laser gyro isn't

3276.68 --> 3284.0
though right and that device you

3280.13 --> 3290.9300000000003
supposedly use to explore in mines right

3284.0 --> 3293.15
it doesn't actually drift either [ __ ]

3290.93 --> 3295.46
idiots I'm just so sick of these ballers

3293.15 --> 3298.4300000000003
I can't i should ban you all like Zep
