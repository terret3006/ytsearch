93.119 --> 97.02
right now it's really beautiful so

95.04 --> 101.46000000000001
that's

97.02 --> 104.69999999999999
it's really beautiful look at this

116.159 --> 120.43900000000001
okay they're close enough look at that

122.64 --> 127.56
yeah it's it's quite windy but the sun

125.28 --> 129.84
is really nice and warm when it's out

127.56 --> 131.06
earlier it wasn't out and was kind of

129.84 --> 134.099
cool

131.06 --> 137.48
and the wind blows a lot when

134.099 --> 137.48
when the sun's not out

142.14 --> 147.05999999999997
all right

143.819 --> 148.98
but another nice after summer day this

147.06 --> 151.44
fight

148.98 --> 153.48
occasional big cloud

151.44 --> 158.18
and a bit of rain

153.48 --> 161.51899999999998
right plants are still enjoying this

158.18 --> 163.8
I got a new basil plant in preparation

161.519 --> 165.48000000000002
of making spaghetti

163.8 --> 167.58
which

165.48 --> 169.44
funnily enough the other two basil

167.58 --> 172.62
plants were originally designated for

169.44 --> 175.14
that as well but then it never got to it

172.62 --> 177.54
because I was gonna have spaghetti with

175.14 --> 179.51899999999998
my roommate and then she went on

177.54 --> 182.4
vacation and then the vacation lasted

179.519 --> 185.94
even longer than anticipated

182.4 --> 188.87900000000002
but yeah she's here now and I'm gonna

185.94 --> 191.159
probably eat spaghetti somewhere

188.879 --> 193.67999999999998
looking forward to that

191.159 --> 195.12
and bragging about how freaking good my

193.68 --> 198.0
spaghetti sauce is

195.12 --> 199.92000000000002
right anyway dude what's up with the

198.0 --> 202.98
darkness here

199.92 --> 205.319
so the light contrast

202.98 --> 208.98
right anyway

205.319 --> 211.01899999999998
hello Richard G first in chat low fruit

208.98 --> 215.04
good to see you

211.019 --> 218.459
it is Thursday the 20th or 31st of

215.04 --> 218.459
August 2023

220.2 --> 222.92
August

224.06 --> 229.44
summer went by quick it was pretty nice

226.86 --> 230.76000000000002
though I only had a few extremely hot

229.44 --> 235.159
days

230.76 --> 238.019
and it wasn't even that terrible I mean

235.159 --> 240.54
somewhere from

238.019 --> 242.81900000000002
last year I think was hotter than this

240.54 --> 245.04
than this one

242.819 --> 247.07999999999998
it was like kind of continually like

245.04 --> 249.79899999999998
that

247.08 --> 251.64000000000001
compared to this year where it's been

249.799 --> 254.12
clouded a lot

251.64 --> 254.11999999999998
anyway

257.04 --> 264.12
how are you guys doing

259.919 --> 267.12
I'm a bit wobbly because well I got up

264.12 --> 269.759
earlier than normal I love it

267.12 --> 273.06
like half past 10

269.759 --> 275.1
because I had an appointment

273.06 --> 278.16
and the appointment just turned out to

275.1 --> 281.06
be basically just an update conversation

278.16 --> 281.06
which is kind of weird

282.02 --> 288.18
and I completely rolled yeah I basically

286.919 --> 290.88
just

288.18 --> 292.979
was me I was just being me explain some

290.88 --> 295.74
things about what I was doing

292.979 --> 299.21999999999997
and I completely overrun the guy he was

295.74 --> 301.08
like yeah like I'm just working for the

299.22 --> 303.12
government I don't know about any of

301.08 --> 307.02
these things like he didn't know what a

303.12 --> 308.58
15-minute city was okay so that's like

307.02 --> 311.639
oh

308.58 --> 314.21999999999997
well okay here here's what a 15 minutes

311.639 --> 316.639
it is and this is where it's coming from

314.22 --> 321.96000000000004
and I had to just explain it because

316.639 --> 321.96000000000004
apparently this guy is not very informed

322.32 --> 327.0
is just like does

324.78 --> 328.19899999999996
like social work for the government I

327.0 --> 330.78
think

328.199 --> 332.34000000000003
but he was a very nice man though so it

330.78 --> 336.29999999999995
was actually kind of a pleasant

332.34 --> 338.94
conversation it was very sympathetic

336.3 --> 340.56
and I started out like really nervous

338.94 --> 342.86
like oh they're gonna trick me they're

340.56 --> 346.5
gonna trick me to [ __ ] myself up somehow

342.86 --> 349.97900000000004
but turned out no it was basically come

346.5 --> 352.5
came down to like yeah if there's like

349.979 --> 354.71999999999997
are you all informed about the subsidies

352.5 --> 358.44
that you can get

354.72 --> 360.66
it's like yeah are you sure like we gave

358.44 --> 362.28
you all the money and that's pretty much

360.66 --> 365.16
what it came down to and it was like

362.28 --> 367.44
yeah no I am it's all

365.16 --> 370.91900000000004
that's all happening

367.44 --> 374.639
but uh I also asked him like

370.919 --> 377.15999999999997
like what is our city doing to like

374.639 --> 379.5
try to counter these outrageous

377.16 --> 383.28000000000003
electricity prizes

379.5 --> 385.62
like I have ideas like why don't we set

383.28 --> 387.919
up like a house where

385.62 --> 390.66
where there's like a lot of like a

387.919 --> 393.59999999999997
hydrogen-based electricity generators I

390.66 --> 395.94
mean it's relatively easy to do that and

393.6 --> 399.38
I mean if that could literally help with

395.94 --> 399.38
the electricity prices

399.419 --> 405.06
wouldn't that be a big win for the city

401.94 --> 407.4
like and I was saying like yeah I want

405.06 --> 409.919
to get into contact with like

407.4 --> 413.039
the more the political decision makers

409.919 --> 415.139
and see like if I could like just give

413.039 --> 418.08
some input

415.139 --> 421.259
and he said that he was gonna ask around

418.08 --> 423.3
and get back to me about that

421.259 --> 425.819
and usually when they say that they

423.3 --> 429.6
actually do mean it

425.819 --> 430.86
so that's kind of interesting

429.6 --> 433.139
I might

430.86 --> 435.72
just get involved

433.139 --> 437.58
with the city more

435.72 --> 440.639
because my city is not going to be a

437.58 --> 444.0
15-minute city as far as I know

440.639 --> 445.68
and that's a good sign so if the if

444.0 --> 448.62
there's people in there that are

445.68 --> 451.02
sensible well maybe I can like help them

448.62 --> 453.199
out a bit

451.02 --> 457.19899999999996
give them some directions

453.199 --> 459.12
from conspiracy world as it were proper

457.199 --> 462.12
directions instead of just leading them

459.12 --> 464.4
to some dead end of the world is gonna

462.12 --> 465.72
be destroyed or something nonsense ago

464.4 --> 466.88
right

465.72 --> 470.22
but

466.88 --> 472.56
yeah so it turned out into a pretty nice

470.22 --> 475.58000000000004
conversation and I feel pretty good and

472.56 --> 475.58
then the weather cleared up

475.699 --> 479.36
and now the show

480.419 --> 485.639
right right so

483.36 --> 488.34000000000003
you got an Illuminati Casa that I'm

485.639 --> 489.36
gonna bite into very quickly because I

488.34 --> 490.85999999999996
need

489.36 --> 493.319
to be hungry

490.86 --> 495.96000000000004
no rookola

493.319 --> 499.28000000000003
let's run out but I do got a Gusto might

495.96 --> 502.979
drink that bit later usually not

499.28 --> 506.039
advisable when I get up earlier than I'm

502.979 --> 509.65999999999997
used to but we'll see

506.039 --> 509.65999999999997
anyway hello steamy Traveler

510.12 --> 515.0600000000001
being warm rain here wow okay love fruit

520.14 --> 526.039
how many times a year do we meet with

522.599 --> 526.0390000000001
the guy it's like once a year

537.48 --> 544.38
right and and yeah it wasn't really like

541.2 --> 546.6600000000001
checking up and like oh are you going to

544.38 --> 549.48
yeah he wasn't like oh when are you

546.66 --> 551.64
gonna get a job or something like

549.48 --> 554.22
I think that they kind of stopped doing

551.64 --> 555.72
that because

554.22 --> 557.7
well

555.72 --> 560.279
because of all the financial calamities

557.7 --> 562.5600000000001
that are happening

560.279 --> 565.26
there's actually more people losing jobs

562.56 --> 566.5799999999999
because they just can't because like the

565.26 --> 569.24
jobs are

566.58 --> 569.24
like

569.279 --> 574.5
negated or what do you they stopped

572.399 --> 576.72
working because financially it's not

574.5 --> 578.519
feasible anymore all that kind of [ __ ]

576.72 --> 580.5
so

578.519 --> 583.279
there were more worried like are you

580.5 --> 583.279
getting around

583.38 --> 589.5
which is by the way very nice

586.38 --> 593.3389999999999
I mean that is actually very social that

589.5 --> 594.839
government like checks up on its

593.339 --> 597.1800000000001
citizens

594.839 --> 600.5400000000001
to see like hey are you getting around

597.18 --> 604.14
in these obviously bad times like

600.54 --> 606.06
that's great I like that they check up

604.14 --> 608.8199999999999
that's good that's like one of the

606.06 --> 611.2199999999999
better things about socialism

608.82 --> 614.0400000000001
when it's actually socialism and not

611.22 --> 616.64
just an excuse for the rich to plunder

614.04 --> 616.64
the poor

622.14 --> 625.98
but yeah it seems to be like a standard

624.12 --> 628.86
once a year thing

625.98 --> 631.94
I'll just send you a letter like Oh Come

628.86 --> 631.94
here that's it

633.48 --> 637.44
but the first time I've had one of these

635.64 --> 641.1
conversations or like one of the first

637.44 --> 643.32
times in 2015 or something that one was

641.1 --> 645.36
just like that was terrible like there

643.32 --> 648.0600000000001
was somebody that like didn't like the

645.36 --> 650.64
look of me I was feeling really bad

648.06 --> 653.9399999999999
because I was still like having issues

650.64 --> 656.04
with like hallucinations and [ __ ]

653.94 --> 657.12
from Dark World Visions getting back to

656.04 --> 659.519
me

657.12 --> 661.32
and that went all wrong and they were

659.519 --> 664.92
like trying to push me and I was like

661.32 --> 667.32
really like so allergic to it

664.92 --> 669.62
but I mean it hasn't happened like that

667.32 --> 669.62
since

672.48 --> 678.1800000000001
also I've just been more identified by

675.959 --> 679.68
the people here that work in the

678.18 --> 682.8
government here so they kind of know

679.68 --> 685.3199999999999
like okay that's yeah he's just

682.8 --> 687.4799999999999
smart and

685.32 --> 689.339
like

687.48 --> 692.5790000000001
like

689.339 --> 694.8000000000001
because like he's just like super odd

692.579 --> 697.64
duck out because he's probably because

694.8 --> 697.64
he's so smart

697.74 --> 703.86
and and I mean when you really ask

701.519 --> 706.76
they all admit like yeah it is all

703.86 --> 706.76
getting really crazy

707.399 --> 711.6
like they're going along with it but

709.8 --> 714.3599999999999
when you ask them they'll tell you like

711.6 --> 716.76
yeah we do realize that it's all getting

714.36 --> 719.4590000000001
kind of crazy right so

716.76 --> 722.459
I'm glad they're not all like oh you

719.459 --> 726.1999999999999
have to think like the system Fanatics

722.459 --> 726.1999999999999
thank God they're not like that

728.279 --> 733.5
right anyway

730.98 --> 735.839
so I'm very happy that not our entire

733.5 --> 739.32
that our local government here of this

735.839 --> 741.48
city isn't all filled with sjw types

739.32 --> 742.74
because they are out there in

741.48 --> 745.26
governments

742.74 --> 749.16
it's just I haven't seemed to be I

745.26 --> 751.2
haven't really been bumping into them

749.16 --> 754.5
here

751.2 --> 756.839
I'm very happy about that

754.5 --> 759.779
and they know it I mean I'm very open

756.839 --> 762.0
about my positions like they know I'm

759.779 --> 763.68
like homophobic and all that

762.0 --> 765.66
and I've told them that I'm really

763.68 --> 769.079
worried about

765.66 --> 771.18
like the sexualization of children

769.079 --> 774.62
told them that last year

771.18 --> 774.62
so they know where I stand

776.1 --> 781.2
and they're not harassing me so I'm very

778.8 --> 783.4399999999999
happy about that

781.2 --> 783.44
right

783.74 --> 787.76
so enough about that

794.82 --> 799.2600000000001
right yeah yesterday's flatters debate

797.88 --> 801.779
was

799.26 --> 805.5
was pretty cool bit disappointing in the

801.779 --> 808.56
end because Nathan like banned chai key

805.5 --> 810.899
and Jackie was being super obnoxious so

808.56 --> 813.18
I totally get it but still it's always

810.899 --> 815.579
like

813.18 --> 818.2199999999999
ah Nathan why don't you just do it like

815.579 --> 822.18
me just like ban them

818.22 --> 824.1
and then just like after like a few

822.18 --> 826.8199999999999
months or something like unband them

824.1 --> 826.82
again like

828.66 --> 836.88
because because these numpties are such

832.22 --> 840.899
they're such pristine material to

836.88 --> 844.459
demonstrate like the psychological side

840.899 --> 844.459
of ball fanaticism

845.639 --> 850.2
like they're so good

848.16 --> 852.18
to show

850.2 --> 854.339
that's why I personally wouldn't

852.18 --> 856.9799999999999
permanently ban them although I

854.339 --> 858.839
definitely like send them out like get

856.98 --> 860.88
out and don't come back for a while I

858.839 --> 862.86
would totally do that I do that on my

860.88 --> 865.56
own show here it's like

862.86 --> 869.9590000000001
somebody just gets on my nerves I kick

865.56 --> 869.959
them out but eventually I will and Venom

870.839 --> 874.62
and then if they immediately start

872.88 --> 876.3
getting on my nerves again well then I

874.62 --> 879.18
bet just ban them immediately again

876.3 --> 882.24
right it's all about getting

879.18 --> 885.18
on my nerves

882.24 --> 887.779
whether they stop doing that or not

885.18 --> 887.779
anyway

889.079 --> 891.1389999999999
um

893.279 --> 900.06
right so Jackie was on there oh I did a

896.76 --> 903.019
bit of a ball win that was pretty cool

900.06 --> 903.0189999999999
that was kind of fun

905.79 --> 911.04
[Music]

907.98 --> 912.6
because well you you just have to hear

911.04 --> 914.8199999999999
that back it was in the after show

912.6 --> 918.0
recording

914.82 --> 918.9590000000001
who have you recently unbanned from your

918.0 --> 921.959
chat

918.959 --> 921.959
uh

927.0 --> 932.579
well I remember remember that I banned

929.639 --> 935.5790000000001
Clary because he joke trollishly said

932.579 --> 937.3199999999999
that he was gay and he wasn't really I

935.579 --> 940.279
unbanned him later

937.32 --> 940.279
uh

941.88 --> 947.24
I think I might have no I'm not sure

948.36 --> 951.26
uh

955.44 --> 960.5400000000001
right but

957.54 --> 962.699
like whoever I ban afterwards when I

960.54 --> 965.04
restarted on this channel after my

962.699 --> 967.92
Armenian bear Channel

965.04 --> 970.699
period of three months I basically

967.92 --> 970.699
unbanned everybody

974.279 --> 979.4399999999999
and then I have to proceed and ban all

976.8 --> 982.079
the sock trolls again but yeah I mean

979.44 --> 983.6600000000001
that's just it's it's standard procedure

982.079 --> 986.519
for this show

983.66 --> 988.38
it's like everybody gets periodic

986.519 --> 991.26
chances to like

988.38 --> 994.579
stop behaving like a bunch of gammas

991.26 --> 994.579
or chanting idiots

994.8 --> 998.279
but if you're gonna come back to the

996.3 --> 999.779
table do the same thing again well then

998.279 --> 1002.36
you're just gonna get kicked out again

999.779 --> 1005.92
immediately until you come back to the

1002.36 --> 1005.92
table and not do that

1006.32 --> 1010.12
and then you can kind of stay around

1010.339 --> 1014.139
and see what you can do with that

1014.36 --> 1020.8000000000001
right so I don't remember exactly who's

1017.12 --> 1020.8
the most recent unban

1025.16 --> 1027.64
oh

1030.919 --> 1037.0400000000002
man these mosquito bites by the way

1034.28 --> 1040.579
are so tenacious like it's three days

1037.04 --> 1043.52
later and I can still feel it

1040.579 --> 1046.54
that's one hell of a mosquito

1043.52 --> 1046.54
that did that

1048.14 --> 1051.8600000000001
at least it's not like weird lumpy

1050.48 --> 1054.4
anymore

1051.86 --> 1054.3999999999999
uh

1058.58 --> 1063.559
does YouTube send a message letting you

1062.0 --> 1067.179
know you've been unbanned that's

1063.559 --> 1067.1789999999999
hilarious no no they don't

1070.179 --> 1076.039
but sometimes I bump into people like in

1074.0 --> 1078.38
other chats that tell me like hey you

1076.039 --> 1081.7
banned me because of this and that and

1078.38 --> 1081.7
I'm like yeah

1083.12 --> 1087.86
that's right that's what you get

1085.94 --> 1091.039
you're not gonna be angry at you in

1087.86 --> 1093.26
another chat but like yeah you act like

1091.039 --> 1096.26
that you're gonna get mad

1093.26 --> 1098.6
or like you like start [ __ ] around

1096.26 --> 1100.64
with me when I'm obviously like getting

1098.6 --> 1103.2199999999998
really pissed off which might be

1100.64 --> 1104.66
irrationally pissed off for some but it

1103.22 --> 1106.94
still doesn't matter like if you notice

1104.66 --> 1109.039
that I'm getting like that don't

1106.94 --> 1112.5800000000002
freaking poke at me

1109.039 --> 1117.14
is for your own safety

1112.58 --> 1119.6599999999999
for your own Internet safety that is uh

1117.14 --> 1124.2990000000002
for your accounts whatever you know what

1119.66 --> 1124.299
I mean right but hey if people like

1124.64 --> 1130.16
communicate to me and then say like yeah

1127.4 --> 1132.5590000000002
sorry about that but could I just get

1130.16 --> 1134.9
back on the show then I'm like yeah sure

1132.559 --> 1140.059
I mean

1134.9 --> 1143.179
if they just recognized why it happened

1140.059 --> 1145.46
and they show signs that they recognized

1143.179 --> 1150.14
why it happened then I'm usually very

1145.46 --> 1152.66
well there I'll be gladly unbanning them

1150.14 --> 1155.179
right because for me it's mostly I just

1152.66 --> 1157.64
want that certain types of behavior to

1155.179 --> 1159.26
stop and when I get pissed off don't

1157.64 --> 1162.22
start dissing me

1159.26 --> 1162.22
it's that simple

1164.48 --> 1167.9
right

1165.86 --> 1170.539
but yeah YouTube doesn't send messages

1167.9 --> 1172.5800000000002
around when you get unbanned that would

1170.539 --> 1175.419
be kind of interesting

1172.58 --> 1175.4189999999999
but

1183.44 --> 1189.679
yeah right I'm gonna take a bite of this

1186.46 --> 1192.4
while it's still warm

1189.679 --> 1192.4
hmm

1226.76 --> 1229.299
oh

1234.14 --> 1239.539
oh

1236.299 --> 1241.7
man I'm so hungry

1239.539 --> 1245.179
I was actually kind of like feeling like

1241.7 --> 1246.919
your stomach imploded from Hunger

1245.179 --> 1249.799
which is better than just being

1246.919 --> 1251.48
nauseated in the morning by the way

1249.799 --> 1253.76
but uh

1251.48 --> 1255.98
I had a little update about lock and key

1253.76 --> 1258.62
I'm almost finished for the entire

1255.98 --> 1260.78
series and yesterday I commented how I

1258.62 --> 1262.28
thought like that the third season was

1260.78 --> 1266.36
kind of like

1262.28 --> 1269.08
a bit directionless it seemed but I have

1266.36 --> 1269.08
to take that back

1270.08 --> 1275.84
it's like the season started a bit

1272.6 --> 1278.8999999999999
seemingly directionless but

1275.84 --> 1281.24
as it progressed it definitely seemed

1278.9 --> 1283.64
like they just built another puzzle like

1281.24 --> 1286.1
they did with the previous seasons and

1283.64 --> 1288.2
it did All Connect up

1286.1 --> 1289.6399999999999
especially when the time travel stuff

1288.2 --> 1292.46
gets more

1289.64 --> 1295.46
involved or well it doesn't even get

1292.46 --> 1299.38
that overly involved it's just also they

1295.46 --> 1299.38
make things go so complicated

1300.86 --> 1303.6999999999998
like

1304.46 --> 1309.38
after you finish through this entire

1306.679 --> 1311.9
series like it wouldn't be surprising

1309.38 --> 1313.5800000000002
that you would want to perhaps watch it

1311.9 --> 1316.7
again

1313.58 --> 1318.98
just to like make notes of like every

1316.7 --> 1321.5
key and exactly what it does and who has

1318.98 --> 1323.659
what because it's like one hell of a

1321.5 --> 1325.94
hectic

1323.659 --> 1328.3400000000001
things that happening oh this person

1325.94 --> 1330.2
finds that key oh this person loses that

1328.34 --> 1332.9599999999998
key oh that person

1330.2 --> 1334.3400000000001
gets locked into some magic thing and

1332.96 --> 1337.3400000000001
then ah

1334.34 --> 1339.5
like it's very hectic everything that

1337.34 --> 1341.299
happens and it's like even for somebody

1339.5 --> 1343.94
as nerdish as me

1341.299 --> 1348.32
that's all about well designing magical

1343.94 --> 1350.72
items and spells literally is what my

1348.32 --> 1353.78
DND book was for and so I'm very

1350.72 --> 1356.059
familiar with that process

1353.78 --> 1359.12
and even for me it was like kind of hard

1356.059 --> 1361.3999999999999
to keep track of like every detail

1359.12 --> 1364.1589999999999
I mean it worked well enough and it

1361.4 --> 1365.7800000000002
seemed very consistent but to actually

1364.159 --> 1369.159
keep track

1365.78 --> 1369.1589999999999
is kind of difficult

1371.6 --> 1375.3799999999999
also because well

1374.07 --> 1377.78
[Music]

1375.38 --> 1380.2990000000002
people's kind of switch around but

1377.78 --> 1383.24
instead of it oh they switch bodies

1380.299 --> 1384.74
episode like all science fiction style

1383.24 --> 1387.799
series

1384.74 --> 1390.2
they have it's much more complicated and

1387.799 --> 1393.02
logical but it it does lead to like oh

1390.2 --> 1396.2
this person is lying about that

1393.02 --> 1399.2
well if you forgot that

1396.2 --> 1401.0
then you get really mixed up with the

1399.2 --> 1403.3400000000001
lore and like what is where and it's

1401.0 --> 1405.5
like because sometimes people lie and

1403.34 --> 1407.4189999999999
it's like you have to actually really

1405.5 --> 1409.94
keep sharp trying you can't just walk

1407.419 --> 1412.1000000000001
away in the middle of the the series

1409.94 --> 1415.7
playing to go to the toilet to come back

1412.1 --> 1418.58
because you'll like lose bit like

1415.7 --> 1420.2
potentially critical infos what is

1418.58 --> 1424.6999999999998
actually happening

1420.2 --> 1426.919
so it does require attention

1424.7 --> 1429.4
but yeah the third season panned out

1426.919 --> 1429.4
pretty good

1431.1 --> 1435.1999999999998
[Music]

1432.86 --> 1438.039
and overall I think it's a it's actually

1435.2 --> 1438.039
a very good series

1439.82 --> 1446.539
I wonder like how the books are

1442.46 --> 1448.76
if they're like better or

1446.539 --> 1452.48
not better

1448.76 --> 1454.52
and that like all the CDI really helped

1452.48 --> 1456.559
because the CGI in the series is pretty

1454.52 --> 1460.0
good and the designs of the objects and

1456.559 --> 1460.0
all that is really neat

1461.26 --> 1468.26
and when you're reading well unless the

1465.26 --> 1470.059
book is specifically riddled with

1468.26 --> 1473.9
pictures

1470.059 --> 1477.32
you're mostly just trying to imagine it

1473.9 --> 1478.88
so I wonder what people that read the

1477.32 --> 1482.5
original book

1478.88 --> 1482.5
what they think about the series

1484.94 --> 1489.4
I think this is definitely originally a

1487.22 --> 1489.4
book

1491.24 --> 1496.34
anyway

1493.46 --> 1498.8600000000001
right so

1496.34 --> 1502.1789999999999
I'll see you guys next time

1498.86 --> 1502.1789999999999
with the next comment

1502.88 --> 1506.98
eight minutes of silence

1505.58 --> 1510.02
fine

1506.98 --> 1512.1200000000001
see you in the next comment

1510.02 --> 1515.679
I'll just eat my illuminatiosa until

1512.12 --> 1515.6789999999999
something happens in my chat

1544.88 --> 1551.14
hmm

1547.46 --> 1551.14
wow weather is beautiful

1569.17 --> 1574.48
[Music]

1572.0 --> 1574.48
oh

1582.08 --> 1590.02
see that now that's deep blue

1586.4 --> 1590.02
that's what it actually looks like

1600.64 --> 1608.179
indeed anybody watch flat side with two

1604.179 --> 1612.22
I noticed it I didn't watch it though I

1608.179 --> 1612.22
would just was not in the mood for that

1612.38 --> 1617.6000000000001
no I had it already had like a

1614.9 --> 1620.6200000000001
a full session of chaiky

1617.6 --> 1620.62
behind me

1622.34 --> 1627.6999999999998
anything particularly interesting

1625.279 --> 1627.7
happening

1634.76 --> 1637.0
foreign

1705.039 --> 1711.4
that really really hit the spot

1708.74 --> 1711.4
ah

1712.94 --> 1718.72
I needed that

1716.12 --> 1718.7199999999998
oh

1720.86 --> 1724.3999999999999
it's like all sudden all of a sudden

1722.48 --> 1727.58
like all this energy just starts like

1724.4 --> 1729.5800000000002
finally moving

1727.58 --> 1729.58
um

1747.82 --> 1752.6
oh really odds

1750.62 --> 1755.779
tune

1752.6 --> 1758.84
was tying flat side into a knot what not

1755.779 --> 1763.72
did he tie flat side into

1758.84 --> 1763.72
blood sugar maybe steamy it could be

1773.6 --> 1776.1999999999998
okay

1787.64 --> 1791.919
right yeah Richard G

1792.799 --> 1797.9189999999999
I have no winning arguments right

1795.38 --> 1797.919
but

1798.2 --> 1803.299
it's usually they just end up like

1800.419 --> 1805.3400000000001
nitpicking about oh this is how you see

1803.299 --> 1806.72
that and that

1805.34 --> 1808.9399999999998
because

1806.72 --> 1812.179
at the foundation like yeah they're not

1808.94 --> 1815.179
winning any arguments

1812.179 --> 1818.0800000000002
come on brighten up a bit

1815.179 --> 1818.0800000000002
yeah that's better

1821.0 --> 1823.0
um

1827.419 --> 1832.039
yeah so these wins are kind of like

1830.299 --> 1835.399
playground

1832.039 --> 1838.179
School playground wins Richard G it's

1835.399 --> 1838.1789999999999
not really a win

1847.1 --> 1852.32
perceived wins that's right

1849.2 --> 1855.6200000000001
because later in life nobody's gonna

1852.32 --> 1858.86
give a [ __ ] on who was the most badass

1855.62 --> 1863.799
at the school playground right

1858.86 --> 1863.799
nobody later actually cares about that

1867.38 --> 1872.96
but it does typically reveal School

1870.98 --> 1877.419
playground as to like

1872.96 --> 1877.419
what it is that you do socially

1877.46 --> 1882.38
like what your position is among other

1880.1 --> 1884.6
people what do you typically do with

1882.38 --> 1886.159
other people and how do you respond to

1884.6 --> 1889.039
other people that's the thing that you

1886.159 --> 1891.74
do get to learn at the school playground

1889.039 --> 1895.1
whatever happens there like nobody

1891.74 --> 1896.96
actually cares like for later

1895.1 --> 1898.399
like what's the worst that could have

1896.96 --> 1901.24
happened like oh

1898.399 --> 1903.86
I bullied or I got bullied

1901.24 --> 1906.32
or an accident happened or something

1903.86 --> 1908.4799999999998
that can happen

1906.32 --> 1912.9189999999999
people can get hurt

1908.48 --> 1915.58
and that's it like nobody actually cares

1912.919 --> 1915.5800000000002
like

1916.22 --> 1921.26
if you're gonna go for a job interview

1918.14 --> 1922.94
nobody's gonna ask you like what

1921.26 --> 1925.1
arguments you want on the school

1922.94 --> 1927.559
playground you see

1925.1 --> 1929.36
that's my point so that's what they're

1927.559 --> 1931.58
going for it's just the perceived wins

1929.36 --> 1934.4599999999998
it's just playground

1931.58 --> 1936.3799999999999
playground debates

1934.46 --> 1939.14
that's what it is now for the Ballers

1936.38 --> 1942.0800000000002
it's School playground debates the

1939.14 --> 1944.38
perceived win because it doesn't really

1942.08 --> 1944.3799999999999
matter

1960.2 --> 1966.88
right so yeah not super appealing to me

1963.62 --> 1966.8799999999999
really mctoon

1976.22 --> 1980.779
to be yeah to be fair guys I mean I

1978.98 --> 1983.059
don't understand why people are still

1980.779 --> 1984.86
interested actually in just watching

1983.059 --> 1987.86
those things

1984.86 --> 1991.7199999999998
debates between anti-flat earthers and

1987.86 --> 1991.7199999999998
and Flat Earth like

1995.779 --> 2000.34
why do you still get out of that serious

2003.48 --> 2009.6
it's all a bunch of reified techno

2007.179 --> 2009.6000000000001
babble

2009.76 --> 2016.96
and just School playground tactics

2014.26 --> 2019.96
getting in each other's ways

2016.96 --> 2019.96
distracting

2043.419 --> 2047.76
and the chat yeah the chats are even

2045.399 --> 2047.76
worse

2049.899 --> 2052.98
I know what you mean

2064.119 --> 2070.32
all right but also the reason why I keep

2066.94 --> 2070.32
my chat very clean

2071.679 --> 2076.0
because you have like if you're gonna do

2073.78 --> 2078.639
a serious Flat Earth Channel with daily

2076.0 --> 2081.76
interactive activity with the chat

2078.639 --> 2084.76
you need proper scrubbers because you're

2081.76 --> 2087.8790000000004
gonna build a plaque and that plaque is

2084.76 --> 2092.32
[ __ ] trolls that like insist like no

2087.879 --> 2095.679
this like we have a right to be here and

2092.32 --> 2098.32
represent our [ __ ]

2095.679 --> 2100.3
that ignores everything

2098.32 --> 2101.7400000000002
they think they have the right to do

2100.3 --> 2104.46
that

2101.74 --> 2104.4599999999996
and they don't

2110.44 --> 2116.579
right you can try to make an argument

2112.66 --> 2116.5789999999997
and then you will get a rebuttal

2117.52 --> 2124.3
and then if you just ignore everything

2120.52 --> 2126.7599999999998
that comes out of that well then

2124.3 --> 2130.0
that's your problem now if you make it

2126.76 --> 2132.099
my problem by basically do ignoring it

2130.0 --> 2136.119
actively and doing the same things over

2132.099 --> 2138.82
again then I'll get annoyed with it

2136.119 --> 2141.119
because you're ignoring what was given

2138.82 --> 2141.119
to you

2142.0 --> 2146.7
and then you might get kicked out

2143.859 --> 2146.7
eventually

2147.88 --> 2150.82
but

2149.14 --> 2153.7599999999998
yeah

2150.82 --> 2157.1400000000003
I mean a baller can definitely come in

2153.76 --> 2157.1400000000003
and try to make an argument

2158.619 --> 2163.359
right it's not about

2160.9 --> 2165.7000000000003
that Ballers come in and make arguments

2163.359 --> 2169.0
it's about that

2165.7 --> 2171.0989999999997
flat earthers myself included respond to

2169.0 --> 2173.8
said arguments

2171.099 --> 2176.7400000000002
sometimes with detail

2173.8 --> 2179.32
and then that response is completely

2176.74 --> 2181.4799999999996
ignored and then it's done over again

2179.32 --> 2184.2400000000002
like with the whole

2181.48 --> 2186.4
oh why do the stars rotate it a

2184.24 --> 2188.859
different direction

2186.4 --> 2190.9
at the southern crawl like south of the

2188.859 --> 2192.0989999999997
Equator versus north of the equator

2190.9 --> 2195.46
right that

2192.099 --> 2199.78
and it's a very easily answered question

2195.46 --> 2202.96
yet it was echoed for like over a year

2199.78 --> 2205.48
that one particular individual kept

2202.96 --> 2208.06
asking it over and over and over again

2205.48 --> 2211.06
just never stopped getting the same and

2208.06 --> 2213.88
mostly the same answers

2211.06 --> 2218.2
and just not listening to that and then

2213.88 --> 2221.7000000000003
go like ask it over again

2218.2 --> 2224.4399999999996
and that's the type of

2221.7 --> 2226.7999999999997
crazies we have to deal with that's

2224.44 --> 2226.8
flatter

2228.76 --> 2232.8590000000004
people that don't listen to reason

2234.54 --> 2241.38
they only ask questions in the hope that

2238.0 --> 2241.38
there isn't a rebuttal

2253.24 --> 2259.24
when it's anti-flaties

2256.48 --> 2262.3
right yeah but most of those the trolls

2259.24 --> 2264.52
that we know they are anti-flaties

2262.3 --> 2267.099
regular ballers

2264.52 --> 2268.96
usually don't hang around that long you

2267.099 --> 2272.92
see

2268.96 --> 2275.92
because as a genuine ball believer you

2272.92 --> 2279.88
just get exposed to all this information

2275.92 --> 2282.94
you can't stay a baller

2279.88 --> 2285.2200000000003
because you get to see all the secret

2282.94 --> 2287.68
doors that you're not supposed to even

2285.22 --> 2289.24
be aware of just be able to stay in the

2287.68 --> 2291.7
magic trick

2289.24 --> 2294.5789999999997
in the ball spell and actually believing

2291.7 --> 2296.2599999999998
that it's real you can't have a peek at

2294.579 --> 2298.1800000000003
those doors

2296.26 --> 2300.76
and when you do

2298.18 --> 2303.5789999999997
you just like

2300.76 --> 2305.32
it's like you've been looking at a 3D

2303.579 --> 2307.1800000000003
image all this time like this like

2305.32 --> 2310.3590000000004
cross-eyed so you see it like that

2307.18 --> 2312.0989999999997
that's how it's always been but once you

2310.359 --> 2315.0989999999997
start to notice

2312.099 --> 2317.8
then like you earn cross eye and then

2315.099 --> 2320.26
you can't cross eye again it's like no

2317.8 --> 2322.3590000000004
you just broke the effect well that's

2320.26 --> 2323.98
what happens when you hang around my

2322.359 --> 2325.839
channel and Flat Earth debates channel

2323.98 --> 2328.3
for too long

2325.839 --> 2330.22
as a genuine ball believer

2328.3 --> 2332.92
you get exposed

2330.22 --> 2336.339
to the to the details that will

2332.92 --> 2336.339
literally disable

2336.46 --> 2342.76
you from Comfortably resting on the

2340.839 --> 2345.2799999999997
belief it's a ball

2342.76 --> 2347.7400000000002
you might still end up trying to defend

2345.28 --> 2349.48
it and get it back as more as an

2347.74 --> 2352.06
anti-flat earther

2349.48 --> 2354.4
but you're not sitting comfortably in

2352.06 --> 2357.16
the trust of the dream anymore once you

2354.4 --> 2359.5
get to a peak

2357.16 --> 2362.16
at those secret doors that you're not

2359.5 --> 2362.16
supposed to see

2364.18 --> 2368.44
so actual Ballers usually don't stay

2366.76 --> 2370.6600000000003
Ballers for long

2368.44 --> 2372.82
they figured it out they figure it out

2370.66 --> 2375.94
they go sit on the fence

2372.82 --> 2377.8590000000004
most of the time usually they sit on the

2375.94 --> 2380.56
fence sometimes they actually are like

2377.859 --> 2383.3199999999997
screw this I'm a flat Earth now like

2380.56 --> 2386.74
yeah [ __ ] like my social life is already

2383.32 --> 2389.6800000000003
chaos so it gives a [ __ ]

2386.74 --> 2393.5989999999997
because it will be if you're gonna be a

2389.68 --> 2393.5989999999997
flattered it will be trust me it will be

2394.24 --> 2397.24
there's a lot of people that will turn

2395.859 --> 2400.18
away that's always going to keep

2397.24 --> 2403.3199999999997
happening to people that become flat

2400.18 --> 2403.3199999999997
earthers for the first time

2403.9 --> 2407.8
you can still become an anti-flatter

2405.52 --> 2411.28
other afterward but

2407.8 --> 2414.579
yeah you once you go through that once

2411.28 --> 2416.98
you transition from the the baller spell

2414.579 --> 2419.6800000000003
to seeing the doors that you're not

2416.98 --> 2424.72
supposed to see of the ball Earth model

2419.68 --> 2427.54
then like you go through that phase you

2424.72 --> 2429.2799999999997
you will inevitably confront your

2427.54 --> 2430.3
friends with your inner struggle with

2429.28 --> 2432.94
this

2430.3 --> 2434.98
and they will some of them will have

2432.94 --> 2437.32
very allergic responses to you and

2434.98 --> 2438.94
literally never want to see you again it

2437.32 --> 2442.44
just happens

2438.94 --> 2445.48
and it will probably keep happening

2442.44 --> 2447.94
I mean the percentage of people

2445.48 --> 2450.22
responding like that to it will be less

2447.94 --> 2452.26
and less as time progresses because it

2450.22 --> 2454.839
used to be like all your friends would

2452.26 --> 2457.8390000000004
just say okay he's not now like we need

2454.839 --> 2462.16
to stay away from him now it's like oh

2457.839 --> 2465.16
God you're a flat Earth or two uh okay

2462.16 --> 2465.16
it's

2466.119 --> 2471.599
there's less of an extreme response to

2468.4 --> 2471.599
it this is good

2472.18 --> 2477.64
yeah

2474.7 --> 2480.22
I might do the controllers allow a

2477.64 --> 2482.44
feature they don't Thrive steamy

2480.22 --> 2484.839
traveler we don't Thrive the only reason

2482.44 --> 2487.66
Flat Earth channels actually Thrive is

2484.839 --> 2490.18
because there's actually people that are

2487.66 --> 2492.64
really interested

2490.18 --> 2495.339
yeah those big channels out there

2492.64 --> 2498.339
they're really big why are they so big

2495.339 --> 2501.099
because they got all the gates opened

2498.339 --> 2504.52
and they got artificial support systems

2501.099 --> 2507.46
there too with Bots Farms

2504.52 --> 2508.78
that are just like yeah fake

2507.46 --> 2511.859
participants

2508.78 --> 2511.8590000000004
fake chat people

2517.42 --> 2523.2400000000002
right part of it is also like an

2520.72 --> 2525.3999999999996
advertisement scam

2523.24 --> 2527.3199999999997
because if you have a big Channel you'll

2525.4 --> 2530.56
get more advertisement money

2527.32 --> 2532.839
but yeah the advertisers don't know if

2530.56 --> 2535.0
your channel is a real Channel with a

2532.839 --> 2538.359
real amount of people watching or if

2535.0 --> 2541.359
it's a giant bot hive

2538.359 --> 2543.7
with fake subscribers they don't know

2541.359 --> 2547.98
the difference see so it is kind of like

2543.7 --> 2547.98
a scheme playing on the ad ads as well

2550.42 --> 2555.16
and we don't get

2552.4 --> 2559.06
as flat earthers we don't get

2555.16 --> 2560.98
the bonus bot farms and all that

2559.06 --> 2563.339
and they close the gates as much as

2560.98 --> 2563.339
possible

2564.7 --> 2568.4399999999996
so it doesn't spread around as much

2572.859 --> 2578.44
so I I disagree with

2575.74 --> 2581.6189999999997
Fe channels thriving because of

2578.44 --> 2584.079
controllers they're not

2581.619 --> 2585.7000000000003
compare that to some other channels that

2584.079 --> 2589.0600000000004
are out there that we don't know about

2585.7 --> 2592.1189999999997
and you shouldn't care about at all but

2589.06 --> 2594.099
that are like new YouTube channels

2592.119 --> 2597.28
that are like a year old or something

2594.099 --> 2600.54
that have millions of subscribers and

2597.28 --> 2600.5400000000004
and viewers and [ __ ]

2612.7 --> 2617.859
so yeah we're not getting front row

2616.96 --> 2622.02
seats

2617.859 --> 2622.02
with flat Earth channels we just don't

2623.26 --> 2630.0
continue to exist

2625.9 --> 2630.0
well because of free speech

2632.079 --> 2640.119
because there is inherently nothing evil

2636.22 --> 2642.4599999999996
or a rights violating

2640.119 --> 2645.52
to Flat Earth there's nothing about it

2642.46 --> 2647.88
that is that is like violating anybody's

2645.52 --> 2647.88
rights

2648.64 --> 2656.7
so why like they can't just ban it

2652.42 --> 2656.7000000000003
because they disagree you see

2660.339 --> 2666.16
I mean if they just do that then there

2663.76 --> 2667.96
would be no more right-wing media

2666.16 --> 2669.7
whatsoever it would all just be

2667.96 --> 2671.319
immediately turned off as soon as they

2669.7 --> 2673.2999999999997
found out it was there

2671.319 --> 2677.2799999999997
oh that's not happening

2673.3 --> 2677.28
they're mostly trying to gate it

2678.16 --> 2683.319
like keep it like let it keep going but

2681.46 --> 2685.54
put it in a corner as much as possible

2683.319 --> 2688.66
so that only people that specifically

2685.54 --> 2692.02
want to find that find that nobody like

2688.66 --> 2695.16
bumps into it automatically

2692.02 --> 2695.16
that's gated

2697.3 --> 2701.02
it's like you have a channel you're

2699.4 --> 2704.98
allowed to do what you want but they

2701.02 --> 2708.88
build the gates around you

2704.98 --> 2711.94
so that how people can reach you only

2708.88 --> 2715.0
happens in a certain way and not

2711.94 --> 2717.52
everybody just bumps into you

2715.0 --> 2721.56
the only people searching for something

2717.52 --> 2721.56
can find their way through the gates

2728.91 --> 2731.98
[Music]

2735.66 --> 2741.16
yeah hey how about I don't do that low

2738.7 --> 2743.56
fruit how about I don't start

2741.16 --> 2747.0989999999997
creating bot Farms

2743.56 --> 2748.18
to like make fake people just to seem

2747.099 --> 2750.579
bigger

2748.18 --> 2752.2
wow

2750.579 --> 2753.94
like that would matter you know what

2752.2 --> 2756.7599999999998
would happen everybody would start

2753.94 --> 2760.0
pointing at my channel and say like wow

2756.76 --> 2763.44
that guy definitely has a bot Farm

2760.0 --> 2763.44
how pathetic

2763.839 --> 2769.599
like hey Arwin did you know that most of

2766.24 --> 2773.0989999999997
your followers aren't even real people

2769.599 --> 2773.099
yeah that's embarrassing

2774.339 --> 2779.94
so no thanks

2776.5 --> 2783.579
I'd rather have real people watching

2779.94 --> 2786.06
yeah I'd rather have a people Farm not a

2783.579 --> 2786.0600000000004
bot Farm

2803.26 --> 2808.3
to have a lot of people had enough of

2805.839 --> 2811.74
the detractors and just stopped coming

2808.3 --> 2811.7400000000002
what do you mean Oz

2818.26 --> 2824.88
and yes modern day debates is a control

2821.98 --> 2824.88
Channel it is

2829.72 --> 2835.54
that a lot of gates like they got baller

2833.02 --> 2839.14
Gates they got

2835.54 --> 2842.099
all kinds of gates it's like the guy is

2839.14 --> 2842.0989999999997
a freaking leftist

2843.7 --> 2850.68
that that the channel guy from Modern

2846.579 --> 2850.6800000000003
Day debates he's a freaking leftist dude

2872.619 --> 2878.92
all right but yeah modern database sucks

2875.14 --> 2881.339
I don't like it like they don't do good

2878.92 --> 2881.339
debates

2882.04 --> 2888.579
and whenever they try something it like

2885.04 --> 2891.88
it's just old man it's like

2888.579 --> 2893.5
this is not some on tip of the spear

2891.88 --> 2896.02
debating that's happening this is not

2893.5 --> 2898.0
like oh wow this finally is happening no

2896.02 --> 2900.28
no this is all just stuff like yeah we

2898.0 --> 2902.44
already heard all that [ __ ]

2900.28 --> 2904.7200000000003
years ago

2902.44 --> 2909.3
it's not the tip of the spear at all

2904.72 --> 2909.2999999999997
it's more like recycled old [ __ ]

2916.56 --> 2920.099
yeah anyway

2923.5 --> 2928.619
it does get a lot of attention though in

2926.26 --> 2928.619
the channel

2932.68 --> 2939.0989999999997
I mean like modern day debates like

2935.38 --> 2942.9
organizes debates with like Brenda and

2939.099 --> 2942.9
Sean Hawkins is like okay

2943.38 --> 2947.7000000000003
literally anything goes then

2952.119 --> 2955.119
foreign

2965.319 --> 2972.599
there was 300 watching

2968.98 --> 2972.599
the whole hundred is a good day

2974.74 --> 2981.4599999999996
yeah well if look Oz it's not strange

2978.76 --> 2984.8190000000004
that it happened because

2981.46 --> 2988.18
I suspect that a lot of like

2984.819 --> 2990.099
on the flatter side there are a lot of I

2988.18 --> 2994.9199999999996
don't even know if it's Bots there are

2990.099 --> 2994.92
just a lot of like numpty flat earthers

2995.26 --> 3001.1400000000003
that are more like of the dumb

2998.079 --> 3003.42
hippie dippy type and not all hippie did

3001.14 --> 3005.2799999999997
I keep associating hippie dippy with

3003.42 --> 3006.1800000000003
them not all hippies are dumb just for

3005.28 --> 3007.6800000000003
the record

3006.18 --> 3010.7999999999997
okay

3007.68 --> 3014.0989999999997
but a lot of them are still like kind of

3010.8 --> 3016.579
lazy hedonistic not super intelligent

3014.099 --> 3020.52
so they're like oh yeah let's talk about

3016.579 --> 3022.5
mud floods and Flat Earth and oh and

3020.52 --> 3025.2599999999998
tickle attack and like and they don't

3022.5 --> 3027.66
really keep track yeah seeking star I

3025.26 --> 3030.3190000000004
know I could feel you

3027.66 --> 3033.7799999999997
in the background there I could feel you

3030.319 --> 3036.3
that's why I said like not all hippies

3033.78 --> 3037.3190000000004
are dumb like God not all the hippies

3036.3 --> 3040.319
are dumb

3037.319 --> 3040.319
hmm

3040.52 --> 3047.04
but there are a lot of people around

3044.4 --> 3049.5
that are like Yay Flat Earth but they're

3047.04 --> 3052.14
not really smart

3049.5 --> 3054.18
foreign they're not smart at all they're

3052.14 --> 3056.7799999999997
just like yay we're with flat Earth is

3054.18 --> 3056.7799999999997
our group

3058.7 --> 3063.24
I'm not kidding by the way seeking sir I

3061.44 --> 3064.2000000000003
could literally feel you in the

3063.24 --> 3067.14
background

3064.2 --> 3069.859
I was expecting you to pipe up

3067.14 --> 3069.859
funnily enough

3085.099 --> 3090.54
and I can say hippie dippy as much as I

3088.44 --> 3093.68
freaking want because my parents were

3090.54 --> 3093.68
both hippie dippies

3093.74 --> 3101.54
relatively Smart Ones and I too I was a

3097.38 --> 3101.54
hippie I once was a hippie

3102.78 --> 3108.96
and I got pretty goofy with it too

3106.14 --> 3110.7599999999998
and I just never was dumb like I can't

3108.96 --> 3113.339
like I can't do that

3110.76 --> 3115.5
like even casual dumbness is like oh but

3113.339 --> 3119.66
it's just fun it's like no it's dumb I'm

3115.5 --> 3119.66
allergic to them I can't do that

3122.94 --> 3128.52
unless it's just really funny like funny

3125.94 --> 3131.52
on a smart level

3128.52 --> 3134.4
right you can't be dumb

3131.52 --> 3138.72
in a very smart creative way and that's

3134.4 --> 3143.1800000000003
the only way I find dumb tolerable if

3138.72 --> 3143.18
you're dumb in a funny very clever way

3143.64 --> 3147.5
and that can include playing them

3147.66 --> 3151.98
right which sometimes I do it's like

3150.119 --> 3155.04
somebody says to me something that's

3151.98 --> 3157.079
obviously a joke what do I do I take it

3155.04 --> 3159.3
literal and then roll out an entire

3157.079 --> 3161.7000000000003
elaborate intelligent response to it

3159.3 --> 3164.099
assuming that it was meant literal and

3161.7 --> 3166.2
that confuses the other guy

3164.099 --> 3168.599
well they should know that I'm doing

3166.2 --> 3171.8999999999996
that on purpose because I know they

3168.599 --> 3175.26
demanded as a joke I'm just really good

3171.9 --> 3177.599
at pretending like I didn't notice it

3175.26 --> 3181.099
was meant as a joke I'm really good at

3177.599 --> 3181.099
that and that's my joke

3184.619 --> 3190.6800000000003
I like doing that I think that's funny

3187.26 --> 3193.46
it's sort of artistic way it's just

3190.68 --> 3193.46
funny to me

3196.68 --> 3198.74
um

3200.27 --> 3204.24
[Music]

3201.72 --> 3205.14
ones that just Spam nonsense into the

3204.24 --> 3209.24
chat

3205.14 --> 3209.24
yeah lots of them

3216.0 --> 3220.38
right just take a look over Martin

3217.859 --> 3222.119
liedke's Show I mean he has like the

3220.38 --> 3223.92
biggest flat Earth hippie dippy

3222.119 --> 3226.98
collection on the internet

3223.92 --> 3229.859
pretty much and his chat is just chock

3226.98 --> 3233.099
full with people that are just non-stop

3229.859 --> 3235.02
just spamming nonsense like apps like

3233.099 --> 3239.0
sometimes you can't even read what

3235.02 --> 3239.0
they're saying it's so incoherent

3239.46 --> 3245.119
but yeah that's just some people are not

3243.119 --> 3247.619
very good with communication or

3245.119 --> 3250.2000000000003
rationalizing or figuring things out and

3247.619 --> 3252.7200000000003
they're just like yay finally I can be

3250.2 --> 3254.3999999999996
with flat earthers like that's all there

3252.72 --> 3256.68
is to them they just want to hang around

3254.4 --> 3258.839
with other people that also are flat

3256.68 --> 3260.64
Earth or that is all

3258.839 --> 3263.099
like they don't actually understand

3260.64 --> 3264.42
anything about Flat Earth they don't

3263.099 --> 3267.96
really care they just want to hang

3264.42 --> 3269.64
around other people that want bicker at

3267.96 --> 3271.7400000000002
them when they say the Earth is flat

3269.64 --> 3274.2
that is all like that's all there

3271.74 --> 3276.2
therefore

3274.2 --> 3279.18
foreign

3276.2 --> 3280.2
just incoherent blabbering like they

3279.18 --> 3281.5789999999997
don't know what they're talking about

3280.2 --> 3285.859
like

3281.579 --> 3285.8590000000004
the average person out here you know

3286.079 --> 3291.119
you know flat earthers are just people

3288.119 --> 3291.119
really

3291.599 --> 3296.3
they're just as dumb and flawed as

3293.579 --> 3296.3
everybody else

3300.359 --> 3302.9
ah

3304.319 --> 3310.7599999999998
the only difference is that they're not

3307.079 --> 3313.7400000000002
mentally they're not easily dominated

3310.76 --> 3315.9
that's the real difference is that

3313.74 --> 3318.2999999999997
flat earthers are not even the Dumber

3315.9 --> 3321.7200000000003
ones they're like they just they're not

3318.3 --> 3324.2400000000002
gonna be told how it is you see but you

3321.72 --> 3326.4599999999996
don't have to be smart to have that like

3324.24 --> 3328.859
you can't tell me how things are right

3326.46 --> 3331.26
you don't necessarily have to be smart

3328.859 --> 3334.0789999999997
to do that you can also just be really

3331.26 --> 3336.119
stubborn and like suspicious

3334.079 --> 3338.1800000000003
and then you have that too

3336.119 --> 3338.1800000000003
yeah

3342.24 --> 3347.64
and like most flat earthers even that

3345.96 --> 3350.94
aren't super smart they will like

3347.64 --> 3353.7599999999998
recognize they will just feel it when a

3350.94 --> 3356.64
baller is trying to like pull off some

3353.76 --> 3357.8390000000004
[ __ ] trick they do recognize it by

3356.64 --> 3360.0589999999997
the feel of it they might not

3357.839 --> 3362.22
necessarily understand the mechanisms

3360.059 --> 3363.42
and the math and the geometry behind it

3362.22 --> 3366.66
all

3363.42 --> 3367.859
but they will just recognize it by the

3366.66 --> 3369.2999999999997
feel of it

3367.859 --> 3371.819
they will recognize the social

3369.3 --> 3376.099
components like oh that's a baller

3371.819 --> 3376.099
that's trying to pull a fast one

3378.66 --> 3382.819
even they might even though they might

3380.64 --> 3385.0789999999997
not have like a technical

3382.819 --> 3387.18
reaction to it

3385.079 --> 3389.599
they'll just see like oh he's trying to

3387.18 --> 3389.5989999999997
pull that

3393.9 --> 3399.7400000000002
hey hello North North Trend RW

3404.46 --> 3410.9
oh

3406.2 --> 3410.8999999999996
surprise surprise account made today

3416.819 --> 3419.7599999999998
um

3417.12 --> 3422.7599999999998
[Music]

3419.76 --> 3422.76
foreign

3422.88 --> 3429.559
let me guess

3425.819 --> 3429.5589999999997
you're back with a new account

3436.8 --> 3441.96
at least this time you're not just

3438.839 --> 3445.38
saying oh hello oh like oh yeah of

3441.96 --> 3448.4
course we all know you guy who literally

3445.38 --> 3448.4
just made an account

3448.98 --> 3454.4
at least you're just saying hello that's

3451.5 --> 3454.4
it fine

3474.18 --> 3479.339
right but anyhow I think that there are

3477.48 --> 3481.559
plenty of people that actually watch my

3479.339 --> 3484.319
show that YouTube is

3481.559 --> 3487.26
messing a bit with the numbers

3484.319 --> 3489.3
not too much though I mean I am kind of

3487.26 --> 3492.119
niche

3489.3 --> 3495.8590000000004
not everybody can stomach me

3492.119 --> 3495.859
including intelligent people

3496.68 --> 3500.64
like intelligent people will probably

3498.78 --> 3501.9
recognize like yeah that's a pretty

3500.64 --> 3504.24
smart dude

3501.9 --> 3506.2200000000003
and he probably does know a lot about

3504.24 --> 3507.9599999999996
what he knows things about what he talks

3506.22 --> 3509.7
about

3507.96 --> 3511.5
and I'm very honest about it and I'm

3509.7 --> 3513.7799999999997
developing and I am progressing

3511.5 --> 3515.76
measurably if you actually followed me

3513.78 --> 3517.619
over the years

3515.76 --> 3519.8390000000004
but that still doesn't mean that they'll

3517.619 --> 3521.2200000000003
be like oh man I want to see that guy

3519.839 --> 3524.359
every day

3521.22 --> 3524.359
probably not

3526.799 --> 3531.78
like I could very much imagine that like

3529.44 --> 3534.54
somebody like Owen Benjamin has at some

3531.78 --> 3537.2400000000002
point taken a look at my channel

3534.54 --> 3539.88
got pointed even at like oh that seems

3537.24 --> 3541.799
like a really interesting idea but then

3539.88 --> 3542.7000000000003
they watched the rest and they thought

3541.799 --> 3545.099
like

3542.7 --> 3547.6189999999997
yeah that's a disaster like this is not

3545.099 --> 3551.2400000000002
this is not suitable for a wider

3547.619 --> 3551.2400000000002
audience and I'd be like

3551.94 --> 3556.619
can't really disagree necessarily like I

3555.24 --> 3560.66
am weird

3556.619 --> 3560.6600000000003
I do go over lines

3563.94 --> 3567.96
and then I could make the argument like

3565.92 --> 3570.1800000000003
yeah but there are so many other people

3567.96 --> 3572.2200000000003
out there that are much less coherent

3570.18 --> 3574.2599999999998
than me and much worse behaved and

3572.22 --> 3576.1189999999997
they're doing just great

3574.26 --> 3579.079
well that's not really something that I

3576.119 --> 3579.079
want to compare to me

3579.78 --> 3585.299
I want to be a positive influence and

3582.299 --> 3587.579
not just be a trashy guy that gets a lot

3585.299 --> 3590.78
of attention and all that

3587.579 --> 3590.78
that's not what I want

3595.14 --> 3600.2
your old one contact your old what

3605.04 --> 3609.02
what is your old account

3617.339 --> 3621.859
you got no [ __ ] YouTube I know that

3622.319 --> 3629.599
I'm just asking what's your old account

3624.78 --> 3629.599
name like I don't recognize you

3639.299 --> 3643.46
hello by the way letter Sage

3643.5 --> 3647.9
oh

3645.359 --> 3647.9
my God

3648.24 --> 3652.02
right but anyhow I'd love to have more

3651.0 --> 3654.0
reach

3652.02 --> 3656.7
I'd have to

3654.0 --> 3659.0
have better more consistent quality

3656.7 --> 3659.0
though

3659.22 --> 3666.1189999999997
I have to potentially then like

3661.74 --> 3669.1189999999997
rearrange the entire format again

3666.119 --> 3669.119
what

3670.68 --> 3676.74
I don't know that one

3673.619 --> 3680.0
okay fair enough you're I I'm gonna

3676.74 --> 3680.0
believe you for now

3690.299 --> 3696.319
but I don't know that account either so

3692.7 --> 3696.319
it's all good

3707.76 --> 3713.28
right but anyhow I'd love to have a

3710.28 --> 3716.78
wider audience even but then how would I

3713.28 --> 3716.78
run the show you see

3717.059 --> 3721.92
in a way I need interaction I need fresh

3720.299 --> 3723.299
interaction I need to be able to

3721.92 --> 3726.7200000000003
basically

3723.299 --> 3729.599
On My Level lean on people

3726.72 --> 3733.7599999999998
I lean on people like I put my shoulder

3729.599 --> 3733.76
my elbows on them

3733.799 --> 3737.579
and that squeezes them a bit people

3735.9 --> 3740.1600000000003
usually don't do that but when you

3737.579 --> 3743.54
squeeze somebody then their intelligence

3740.16 --> 3743.54
actually sharpens up

3744.359 --> 3749.5789999999997
and I do all that and I basically like

3746.88 --> 3752.579
use other people's brains

3749.579 --> 3755.2200000000003
to complement my own brain activity and

3752.579 --> 3758.88
by doing that they do the same with me

3755.22 --> 3761.04
it's like I I pull them up

3758.88 --> 3763.2000000000003
and then I use that

3761.04 --> 3765.18
to expand

3763.2 --> 3767.52
and that's kind of like how I do the

3765.18 --> 3770.72
show it's like this Soul like

3767.52 --> 3770.72
self-conscious and all that

3772.5 --> 3777.48
but it is very much tied in an

3775.5 --> 3781.44
interactive thing like I am not a guy

3777.48 --> 3784.859
that's like I'll just talk all by myself

3781.44 --> 3787.7400000000002
for two hours and then

3784.859 --> 3789.839
yeah people can be on the side of that

3787.74 --> 3792.4799999999996
because our Benjamin is kind of like

3789.839 --> 3794.96
that like he can just he could just do

3792.48 --> 3794.96
his thing

3795.119 --> 3798.78
and he's not like gonna have a silent

3797.52 --> 3800.7599999999998
moment

3798.78 --> 3802.5
and then like hey what are you guys

3800.76 --> 3805.7400000000002
saying what are you guys saying to get a

3802.5 --> 3808.44
new thing like he's always capable of

3805.74 --> 3811.9199999999996
just unrolling an entire subject

3808.44 --> 3815.46
I don't know how he does that

3811.92 --> 3817.079
but it is it definitely makes him very

3815.46 --> 3819.299
fluid

3817.079 --> 3821.28
or is it within his presentation and I'm

3819.299 --> 3823.38
a bit jealous of that I wish I could do

3821.28 --> 3825.6600000000003
it as good as he can

3823.38 --> 3828.359
but I'd probably need to learn like a

3825.66 --> 3832.16
piano or something

3828.359 --> 3832.16
or get more into singing

3832.38 --> 3837.6600000000003
like like if there's gonna be some music

3834.72 --> 3841.2599999999998
involved it's you I'm pretty like I have

3837.66 --> 3844.319
really good voice control it's just that

3841.26 --> 3846.42
my singing voice is not exactly like

3844.319 --> 3849.299
gorgeous or something

3846.42 --> 3853.44
but I have a very good control over it

3849.299 --> 3856.5
I'm like a parrot I'm like a sampler

3853.44 --> 3859.799
I can just sample sounds and then copy

3856.5 --> 3862.619
them some usually after just one go

3859.799 --> 3865.68
which is quite astounding

3862.619 --> 3868.859
most people that do that they have to

3865.68 --> 3872.18
like train a bit to even get to a sound

3868.859 --> 3876.48
I'll just like bloop like it's just

3872.18 --> 3880.5589999999997
immediately immediately copy

3876.48 --> 3884.88
it's interesting I've always had that

3880.559 --> 3886.559
as a kid I could do that like very well

3884.88 --> 3889.88
to the point where I could literally

3886.559 --> 3889.88
mimic the sound of a cricket

3891.54 --> 3897.18
like on that frequency and that's crazy

3894.059 --> 3901.7400000000002
like vocal cords are technically not

3897.18 --> 3904.68
made to like create that kind of sound

3901.74 --> 3906.839
and yeah as soon as I became a teenager

3904.68 --> 3909.24
my voice dropped like I definitely lost

3906.839 --> 3911.46
the ability to do that but as a preteen

3909.24 --> 3913.339
I had the ability to literally make the

3911.46 --> 3918.02
sound of a cricket and it was

3913.339 --> 3918.02
indistinguishable from an actual cricket

3922.02 --> 3926.88
like you could have a place filled with

3924.54 --> 3928.799
crickets and I would then just like hide

3926.88 --> 3931.02
behind the tree make the sound of a

3928.799 --> 3933.18
cricket and would literally sound like

3931.02 --> 3935.9
it's a cricket like oh just one of the

3933.18 --> 3935.8999999999996
other crickets

3935.94 --> 3937.94
um

3938.339 --> 3944.099
right couldn't do it too long by the way

3940.38 --> 3947.78
eventually my voice would start to hurt

3944.099 --> 3947.78
if I did that for too long

3947.94 --> 3952.46
that's hurting my voice even thinking

3950.099 --> 3952.46
about it

3952.799 --> 3956.22
because I kept trying as soon as my

3954.72 --> 3960.02
voice got lower

3956.22 --> 3963.49
but then it just hurt a lot

3960.02 --> 3966.54
damn it's not coming out anymore

3963.49 --> 3969.0589999999997
[Music]

3966.54 --> 3972.24
did I do it at school yeah I did at

3969.059 --> 3974.2200000000003
school too dude I did voices all over

3972.24 --> 3976.74
the place I was like

3974.22 --> 3979.859
voice box

3976.74 --> 3983.22
I was voice box guy I did weird funny

3979.859 --> 3987.48
voices silly voices

3983.22 --> 3989.4599999999996
I had entire character landscapes

3987.48 --> 3990.42
and by the way I shared that with my

3989.46 --> 3993.18
brother

3990.42 --> 3995.339
who is older and it's really weird like

3993.18 --> 3998.819
we had that kind of like we communicated

3995.339 --> 4001.099
within our own created world of sort of

3998.819 --> 4004.46
retards

4001.099 --> 4008.6600000000003
and that was based on an original guy a

4004.46 --> 4009.7400000000002
boy that was like the son of a friend of

4008.66 --> 4011.839
my dad

4009.74 --> 4014.4799999999996
and he came over staying but he had like

4011.839 --> 4017.0
this very severe speech impediment that

4014.48 --> 4020.18
like he wasn't [ __ ] but it made him

4017.0 --> 4022.16
sound so [ __ ] dumb that like we

4020.18 --> 4023.7799999999997
couldn't stop laughing about it even

4022.16 --> 4025.46
though we didn't mean to

4023.78 --> 4027.3190000000004
we didn't want to be mean but it was

4025.46 --> 4029.0
just so [ __ ] stupid sounding that

4027.319 --> 4030.92
just we couldn't stop

4029.0 --> 4033.619
making fun of it and then we turn it

4030.92 --> 4036.44
into an entire cosmology basically

4033.619 --> 4041.44
mimicking that voice

4036.44 --> 4041.44
and that lasted for like eight years

4045.02 --> 4049.0389999999998
but I'm not gonna do that anymore I'm

4046.88 --> 4051.2200000000003
not doing that voice it's it's in the

4049.039 --> 4051.2200000000003
past

4056.119 --> 4061.94
but I did voices all the time like all

4059.359 --> 4064.16
the time it was like one of my primary

4061.94 --> 4067.16
forms of communication

4064.16 --> 4069.92
I did more voices and silly mimics than

4067.16 --> 4072.7599999999998
I did actual talking

4069.92 --> 4072.76
when I was a kid

4075.68 --> 4080.0789999999997
but yes I've also demonstrated the

4077.9 --> 4080.079
cricket

4080.23 --> 4085.64
[Music]

4083.72 --> 4088.16
but I mean

4085.64 --> 4090.3799999999997
at that time at that age

4088.16 --> 4092.18
whenever I did something like that I

4090.38 --> 4093.799
would never like get compliments from

4092.18 --> 4096.3189999999995
fellow kids

4093.799 --> 4098.179
like nobody ever gave me compliments

4096.319 --> 4102.259
about what I could do

4098.179 --> 4106.0
they'd mostly just be jealous and just

4102.259 --> 4106.0
try to poke me some more

4106.46 --> 4112.0
I got a lot of jealousy from people when

4108.859 --> 4112.0
I was young a lot

4113.56 --> 4117.279
especially the rich kids

4117.38 --> 4121.52
that was so weird because I'm like yeah

4120.199 --> 4124.759
I'm not rich

4121.52 --> 4126.14
I'm but I'm really talented and like I

4124.759 --> 4128.48
want to help

4126.14 --> 4131.0
and you're like I'm better than you I

4128.48 --> 4133.5199999999995
got money I got a better

4131.0 --> 4136.88
schools this and that and like

4133.52 --> 4139.46
yeah but you're provably insecure

4136.88 --> 4141.92
and you're not actually good at it

4139.46 --> 4144.1
you've been you've been very successful

4141.92 --> 4146.2390000000005
at bluffing that you're good at it

4144.1 --> 4148.88
towards your parents who are your

4146.239 --> 4150.199
funders but you're not actually good at

4148.88 --> 4153.08
that

4150.199 --> 4154.94
and like I don't even know you and I can

4153.08 --> 4157.4
literally point at it within a second

4154.94 --> 4160.2789999999995
and that would just freak them out so

4157.4 --> 4162.5
much that they just all hated me

4160.279 --> 4164.42
like everybody hates Arwin because he

4162.5 --> 4166.839
like sees straight through your

4164.42 --> 4166.839
illusions

4169.219 --> 4175.279
and always has to say it like

4172.759 --> 4178.1
I see it and then I have to say it and

4175.279 --> 4180.400000000001
then it's like [ __ ] you Erwin

4178.1 --> 4183.08
right you could mind your own business

4180.4 --> 4184.46
might you live your own life you stupid

4183.08 --> 4187.9
idiot

4184.46 --> 4187.9
you don't even have any friends

4194.9 --> 4198.62
and to be fair I did not have a lot of

4196.82 --> 4202.94
friends when I was younger I usually had

4198.62 --> 4206.14
just a few like one or two best friends

4202.94 --> 4206.139999999999
sort of thing

4209.12 --> 4214.58
I never really had friend circles that

4211.28 --> 4216.739
were more than four people

4214.58 --> 4219.5
because then they'd start to just like

4216.739 --> 4221.9
talk on their own and then they'd find

4219.5 --> 4223.76
common ground with their retardation and

4221.9 --> 4226.5199999999995
then I'd be outside of the loop because

4223.76 --> 4228.7390000000005
suddenly they had an excuse not to be on

4226.52 --> 4231.5
the Smart Level anymore

4228.739 --> 4234.86
that that's happened to me it's like I

4231.5 --> 4238.1
like a few friends because then

4234.86 --> 4241.339999999999
me being there like forces them to

4238.1 --> 4243.860000000001
uphold the higher level of intellect and

4241.34 --> 4246.26
it goes natural but then if there's more

4243.86 --> 4249.199
people there then guess what suddenly

4246.26 --> 4251.4800000000005
they start talking among one another and

4249.199 --> 4252.799999999999
then I'm outside and now they all lower

4251.48 --> 4254.12
their standards and they're like yeah

4252.8 --> 4258.5
we're much more comfortable being

4254.12 --> 4261.08
retards and like yeah [ __ ] this

4258.5 --> 4262.52
like I've literally seen that happen so

4261.08 --> 4264.32
many times

4262.52 --> 4266.780000000001
it's like oh I got new friends this is

4264.32 --> 4268.099999999999
awesome I can raise them up and and then

4266.78 --> 4269.96
it's like oh they've got more friends

4268.1 --> 4272.179
and then oh oh now they're talking among

4269.96 --> 4274.699
one another oh now they agree that they

4272.179 --> 4277.9
actually like being a [ __ ] more

4274.699 --> 4277.9
oh [ __ ] that

4278.3 --> 4282.860000000001
just find new people

4280.48 --> 4284.599999999999
make sure there's not they don't Clump

4282.86 --> 4287.299999999999
up too much

4284.6 --> 4290.92
or or they'll start being very

4287.3 --> 4290.92
comfortable being [ __ ] again

4296.239 --> 4298.78
anyway

4301.94 --> 4306.259999999999
this might all sound really crazy to you

4304.28 --> 4308.44
guys I don't know

4306.26 --> 4308.4400000000005
thank you

4322.239 --> 4327.379999999999
all right but

4324.679 --> 4330.08
I could give like even a micro example

4327.38 --> 4333.38
of like how that would have happened

4330.08 --> 4334.82
like for example I was smoking cannabis

4333.38 --> 4337.88
okay I did

4334.82 --> 4341.0599999999995
it started when I was 15.

4337.88 --> 4344.9800000000005
just occasionally through friends

4341.06 --> 4344.9800000000005
and later it became pretty standard

4345.08 --> 4350.0
but one of the things I learned very

4347.0 --> 4352.1
quickly is that what the things that

4350.0 --> 4354.199
could happen typically especially when

4352.1 --> 4356.719
you start out like you get Hunger kicks

4354.199 --> 4359.96
like oh I need to eat some chips quickly

4356.719 --> 4362.54
or munchie Munchies right or you get

4359.96 --> 4365.36
really sleepy

4362.54 --> 4367.94
some people get really horny

4365.36 --> 4370.04
right so the typical effects

4367.94 --> 4372.98
but then there would be people that

4370.04 --> 4376.5199999999995
would literally basically smoke it so

4372.98 --> 4378.139999999999
they had an excuse to be lazy and not do

4376.52 --> 4381.14
anything

4378.14 --> 4383.719
and I was like what the [ __ ]

4381.14 --> 4387.26
like no I don't like that I'm smoking to

4383.719 --> 4389.6
like open up some heavy doors

4387.26 --> 4391.9400000000005
like some doors that only open up that

4389.6 --> 4393.860000000001
way and then like get stay complicated

4391.94 --> 4396.799999999999
not lazy like get complicated

4393.86 --> 4398.199
introspective and descriptive and

4396.8 --> 4401.179
surreal

4398.199 --> 4402.199
but other people would just smoke to be

4401.179 --> 4404.4800000000005
lazy

4402.199 --> 4406.639999999999
and I'm like I'm not like that at all

4404.48 --> 4409.459999999999
like I can't even do that

4406.64 --> 4412.159000000001
like smoking cannabis does not make me

4409.46 --> 4414.88
lazy it actually makes me kind of

4412.159 --> 4414.879999999999
hyperactive

4416.12 --> 4423.88
it gives me a weird boost of enthusiasm

4420.679 --> 4423.88
it's always done that

4427.76 --> 4430.179
right

4431.36 --> 4436.5199999999995
like some people they're like no I can't

4433.219 --> 4439.64
smoke because I'll I'll get to

4436.52 --> 4441.679
mellow or I'll just get too flustered

4439.64 --> 4444.56
with me it's like no I can't smoke

4441.679 --> 4447.32
because I'll get too nervous

4444.56 --> 4449.719
like it'll be too much for me like I'll

4447.32 --> 4453.32
get a sensory overload that like that's

4449.719 --> 4457.84
usually the objection for me not like oh

4453.32 --> 4457.84
I'll be too mellow like no

4458.239 --> 4463.5199999999995
that never happens

4460.159 --> 4465.94
with me that is other people it might

4463.52 --> 4465.9400000000005
anyway

4468.32 --> 4472.5199999999995
but yeah I didn't usually not like to

4470.84 --> 4473.900000000001
hang around with other smokers because

4472.52 --> 4477.860000000001
most of them

4473.9 --> 4480.739
would smoke to be lazy and I'm like this

4477.86 --> 4483.739
I like I [ __ ] hate that I hate just

4480.739 --> 4487.879999999999
being lazy and hang around

4483.739 --> 4489.739
I want to do puzzle stuff or something

4487.88 --> 4492.679
right

4489.739 --> 4496.28
I mean when I was a teen it's like give

4492.679 --> 4499.9400000000005
me a joint and then give me a puzzle or

4496.28 --> 4503.179
like a not necessarily a lay down puzzle

4499.94 --> 4506.54
right but like some mechanical puzzle or

4503.179 --> 4509.56
something and dude I'll be like really

4506.54 --> 4509.56
into it quick

4512.36 --> 4519.62
yeah yeah THC levels got much higher yes

4516.08 --> 4522.14
but dude some of this this high THC

4519.62 --> 4525.08
stuff that's coming they call it here

4522.14 --> 4527.659000000001
American or California and weed that's

4525.08 --> 4531.5599999999995
what they call that super high THC like

4527.659 --> 4534.86
that's I've smoked more then half the

4531.56 --> 4536.6
years of my life by now and that stuff

4534.86 --> 4540.199
one Puff

4536.6 --> 4542.84
and I almost like I get dizzy

4540.199 --> 4545.12
I get dizzy from one freaking puff of

4542.84 --> 4548.6
that stuff and I've smoked more than

4545.12 --> 4551.179
half of all the years of my life okay I

4548.6 --> 4553.9400000000005
smoke every day and still take one puff

4551.179 --> 4555.92
of that stuff and it's [ __ ] up it's

4553.94 --> 4558.86
just not it's like this is too much

4555.92 --> 4561.1990000000005
immediately so

4558.86 --> 4563.299999999999
and I'm a day I like I don't even want

4561.199 --> 4565.879999999999
to imagine what it would be like if you

4563.3 --> 4568.76
were if you never had smoked ever and

4565.88 --> 4572.14
then you'd get a hit of that stuff

4568.76 --> 4575.12
dude that's must be like a severe

4572.14 --> 4577.159000000001
hallucination [ __ ] or something that

4575.12 --> 4579.28
can't be good that what comes out of

4577.159 --> 4579.28
that

4597.8 --> 4601.900000000001
yeah

4599.239 --> 4601.9
so

4602.659 --> 4604.839999999999
foreign

4607.3 --> 4611.96
average in the Netherlands they do it

4609.739 --> 4615.259999999999
pretty well with the Cannabis quality

4611.96 --> 4619.2390000000005
it's not too strong

4615.26 --> 4619.2390000000005
it's it's pretty good

4619.88 --> 4626.54
plenty of variety

4622.76 --> 4629.38
like Growers try different things

4626.54 --> 4629.38
periodically

4633.26 --> 4638.7390000000005
paranoia okay yeah slow moon buggy makes

4636.5 --> 4638.739
sense

4640.34 --> 4644.719
20 years ago you stopped horrible pair

4642.44 --> 4648.919999999999
dude but it's all about the strain

4644.719 --> 4651.26
though slow-mo like I have that too

4648.92 --> 4654.86
not telling you to go back to smoking

4651.26 --> 4657.14
weed but I mean it's a general hazard

4654.86 --> 4658.94
you have to just pick your strains

4657.14 --> 4661.6990000000005
really careful

4658.94 --> 4665.178999999999
like if you have paranoia issues which I

4661.699 --> 4668.48
do too with certain types then go for

4665.179 --> 4672.679
the Indica strains

4668.48 --> 4675.339999999999
and be careful with the the maximum THC

4672.679 --> 4675.34
is in it

4681.739 --> 4687.98
foreign

4683.84 --> 4689.12
because from sativa strains I usually

4687.98 --> 4693.08
get

4689.12 --> 4695.42
where to especially if I like don't feel

4693.08 --> 4698.6
super strong if I feel super strong

4695.42 --> 4700.4800000000005
it'll be like it won't do anything it

4698.6 --> 4703.52
won't re

4700.48 --> 4705.739
initiate some kind of panic effect but

4703.52 --> 4708.02
when I feel like just average and I'm

4705.739 --> 4710.419999999999
like not a good time or whatever I feel

4708.02 --> 4713.4400000000005
shitty and smoke it then yeah then I can

4710.42 --> 4716.6
get panic attacks

4713.44 --> 4719.0
or the preliminaries to it because I

4716.6 --> 4721.400000000001
don't actually allow panic attacks to

4719.0 --> 4723.56
truly manifest anymore I know how to

4721.4 --> 4727.28
stop that now

4723.56 --> 4727.280000000001
but yeah

4729.08 --> 4733.719
Ada Studio 68 Bluefield evolution

prescribed yeah that would be

4802.4 --> 4807.5599999999995
interesting if I could get it prescribed

4804.26 --> 4809.719
I wish I could get it prescribed

4807.56 --> 4811.64
because I do use it

4809.719 --> 4816.52
it

4811.64 --> 4816.52
but uh like for medical purposes too

4816.679 --> 4821.7390000000005

4842.239 --> 4847.58
which is quite a shame too with that

4844.159 --> 4852.58

4847.58 --> 4852.58
it could be formed really nicely there

4871.699 --> 4878.08
how do we move on to cannabis talk I

4875.0 --> 4878.08
didn't mean to do that

4878.239 --> 4883.9
maybe it was the hippie dippy stuff

4880.699 --> 4883.9
that made it happen

4885.32 --> 4889.299999999999
I'm gonna blame seeking star water

4890.06 --> 4893.1990000000005

4915.199 --> 4918.199
okay

4921.62 --> 4927.5
yeah I never experienced that I mean I

4924.8 --> 4932.56
grew up in a period where it was just

4927.5 --> 4932.56
getting like legal to sell it

4945.98 --> 4952.159
like in the 90s

4948.92 --> 4955.34
that's like the period when coffee shops

4952.159 --> 4957.62
finally like became an official thing

4955.34 --> 4960.92
for the Netherlands before that it was

4957.62 --> 4962.679
all just dealers it's a secret

4960.92 --> 4965.06
and illegal

4962.679 --> 4967.58
officially or like they would just leave

4965.06 --> 4971.179
it or whatever but then really like

4967.58 --> 4973.94
coffee shops became more of an official

4971.179 --> 4975.62
thing with official rules and then they

4973.94 --> 4978.739
popped up everywhere

4975.62 --> 4981.08
that happened in the 90s so I never got

4978.739 --> 4982.759999999999
I never saw that period that my parents

4981.08 --> 4984.679
went through where it was all just like

4982.76 --> 4988.06
Secret

4984.679 --> 4988.06

it

5152.86 --> 5157.179
what's it and jiren are basically

5154.54 --> 5159.5199999999995
Ballers not really

5157.179 --> 5161.139
here's the weird part though though so

5159.52 --> 5163.06
you're almost right they're not

5161.139 --> 5166.38
basically ballers

5163.06 --> 5169.4800000000005
they're flat earthers that employ

5166.38 --> 5171.6990000000005
anti-flators tactics

5169.48 --> 5173.08
and that's really bad by the way that

5171.699 --> 5175.36
they do that

5173.08 --> 5178.86
because they're using dishonest tactics

5175.36 --> 5178.86
when they don't need to

5179.38 --> 5185.04
you don't need dishonest tactics for

5181.659 --> 5185.04

yeah definitely

5236.98 --> 5249.9
[Music]

5247.06 --> 5254.679
no I don't think jiren is actually smart

5249.9 --> 5257.679
I think he genuinely isn't smart

5254.679 --> 5261.76
I mean I'm sure he's very effective at

5257.679 --> 5264.28
doing things if he plans it and all that

5261.76 --> 5267.76
he doesn't have good oversight he

5264.28 --> 5271.9
doesn't actually have good oversight and

5267.76 --> 5274.3
he mimics like he does a lot that's what

5271.9 --> 5276.339999999999
he does he's done it from the start he

5274.3 --> 5278.56
mimics like he has oversight he doesn't

5276.34 --> 5282.52
actually have good oversight

5278.56 --> 5285.88
when you test him he stumbles mostly

5282.52 --> 5289.56
because it isn't actually smart Jaron

5285.88 --> 5289.56
isn't actually smart

5292.54 --> 5298.42
he's much better at pretending like he

5295.12 --> 5303.04
is with most things by the way

5298.42 --> 5306.88
but wait said is kind of smart he's just

5303.04 --> 5309.46
a bit easier to go on the autopilot like

5306.88 --> 5312.219
if it's it is smart but he often leaves

5309.46 --> 5314.679
his Consciousness out of it

5312.219 --> 5316.84
so he becomes kind of like like a robot

5314.679 --> 5318.639
it's like oh this and that and that this

5316.84 --> 5321.9400000000005
structure but it's like his attention

5318.639 --> 5324.36
isn't really there too much

5321.94 --> 5324.36
like

5324.76 --> 5329.679
like what I do

5326.8 --> 5332.08
like I'm always using my Consciousness

5329.679 --> 5334.42
very active

5332.08 --> 5337.54
in whenever I'm talking and all that and

5334.42 --> 5339.9400000000005
whatever I'm discussing or analyzing

5337.54 --> 5344.58
which it seems to just a lot of the time

5339.94 --> 5344.58
just give like robotic responses

5345.28 --> 5350.86
thank you

5347.62 --> 5354.04
I mean well thought out responses

5350.86 --> 5357.96
but still like

5354.04 --> 5357.96
it's just something robotic about him

5365.139 --> 5371.86
I was charity involved in a Bitcoin scam

5369.34 --> 5375.78
I don't know if it was a scam but yeah

5371.86 --> 5375.78
Jerome was promoting Bitcoin a lot

5387.34 --> 5391.719
yes Doctor Utica I have considered

5389.38 --> 5393.6990000000005
hosting yeah

5391.719 --> 5396.58
like for example I'd like to have the

5393.699 --> 5400.299999999999
more guile on if he actually watches my

5396.58 --> 5402.88
show he might not watch my show he might

5400.3 --> 5405.219
have witnessed a lot of things that he's

5402.88 --> 5407.56
like really objectioning

5405.219 --> 5410.5
objecting to

5407.56 --> 5413.639
I don't know I don't know

5410.5 --> 5413.639
he hasn't told me

5413.8 --> 5419.62
but I would be interested in like having

5416.5 --> 5421.659
a show where I'm having it if I can have

5419.62 --> 5425.219
a conversation with him

5421.659 --> 5425.219
that would be interesting I think

5429.24 --> 5432.3
[Music]

5450.28 --> 5458.159
is Bitcoin a security claims

5454.42 --> 5458.159
yeah but it's not relevant though

5459.58 --> 5464.0199999999995
it's like technically yeah the Bitcoin

5461.739 --> 5466.12
itself is super secure

5464.02 --> 5468.76
but

5466.12 --> 5472.42
it isn't actually

5468.76 --> 5474.88
because it's really traceable that's the

5472.42 --> 5477.76
whole point about like blockchain crypto

5474.88 --> 5480.04
is it's so traceable so is that secure

5477.76 --> 5482.139
that it can be perfectly traced well if

5480.04 --> 5484.84
you consider something being perfectly

5482.139 --> 5487.9800000000005
traceable to be secure well then it's

5484.84 --> 5487.9800000000005
really secure yeah

5488.02 --> 5495.1
right but one thing they're definitely

5491.32 --> 5499.719
overlooking all these Bitcoin promoters

5495.1 --> 5502.719
is that all cryptocurrency is directly

5499.719 --> 5504.82
dependent on banks

5502.719 --> 5509.82
to even be

5504.82 --> 5509.82
counted as any kind of currency

5510.639 --> 5514.84
right as soon as Banks say yeah you know

5513.219 --> 5519.34
what Bitcoin

5514.84 --> 5522.04
uh no no more Bitcoin and they all do it

5519.34 --> 5524.679
what the [ __ ] you gonna do oh well we

5522.04 --> 5528.58
could still trade it among other Bitcoin

5524.679 --> 5530.38
users yeah so then it's up for consensus

5528.58 --> 5532.0
whether you think it's worth something

5530.38 --> 5535.36
or not because you're not going to be

5532.0 --> 5537.639
able to trade it in for money anymore

5535.36 --> 5540.339999999999
and that's always been the issue all

5537.639 --> 5542.88
cryptocurrencies are all dependent on

5540.34 --> 5542.88
banks

5543.699 --> 5548.379999999999
with whether they have any form of value

5546.639 --> 5552.1
whatsoever

5548.38 --> 5554.4400000000005
if a bank doesn't recognize value of a

5552.1 --> 5557.02
crypto then it doesn't have any value

5554.44 --> 5559.9
other than what you and anybody that

5557.02 --> 5562.860000000001
wants to trade it with you ascribe to it

5559.9 --> 5562.86
that's a fact

5564.04 --> 5570.28
so it's really cool oh Bitcoin yeah they

5568.06 --> 5573.04
don't they can't print it yeah sure

5570.28 --> 5576.58
oh it's all encrypted yeah that means

5573.04 --> 5579.76
that they can perfectly trace it

5576.58 --> 5581.62
and since it is crypto it's just like

5579.76 --> 5584.02
fiat currency except they can't

5581.62 --> 5587.32
infinitely print it out of nothing

5584.02 --> 5591.88
but it's still very much dependent on a

5587.32 --> 5595.719
bank to have any kind of worth

5591.88 --> 5600.639
yeah unlike gold and silver which has

5595.719 --> 5603.28
inherent value whether Banks accept it

5600.639 --> 5605.219
for for currency or not

5603.28 --> 5609.96
you see

5605.219 --> 5614.679
Bitcoin has absolutely no value inherent

5609.96 --> 5617.679
whatsoever and unless a bank says that

5614.679 --> 5622.56
it is good as good as money

5617.679 --> 5622.56
only then does it gain actual value

5623.98 --> 5630.339999999999
right and yeah that's why

5627.52 --> 5633.040000000001
probably best to pass on bitcoin because

5630.34 --> 5634.360000000001
Bitcoin is pretty cool it's it's a cool

5633.04 --> 5636.28
system

5634.36 --> 5638.679
when the world's good

5636.28 --> 5640.5
and banks are thriving and they're doing

5638.679 --> 5642.6990000000005
their best they're actually

5640.5 --> 5644.199
accommodating for people instead of

5642.699 --> 5646.839999999999
trying to

5644.199 --> 5649.178999999999
crack down on them to gain control over

5646.84 --> 5652.06
them and then if you have Bitcoin as an

5649.179 --> 5654.46
alternative to Fiat currencies whenever

5652.06 --> 5656.139
you're gonna order something online yeah

5654.46 --> 5658.0
that would be really cool

5656.139 --> 5659.9800000000005
it's like this independent thing that

5658.0 --> 5661.239
you can just oh I'll just use Bitcoin

5659.98 --> 5663.58
this time

5661.239 --> 5666.28
instead of the cash that I use normally

5663.58 --> 5667.239
of my country right that would be pretty

5666.28 --> 5670.84
cool

5667.239 --> 5673.54
however that's not the reason

5670.84 --> 5675.84
or the context of how it was promoted it

5673.54 --> 5679.3
was promoted as something that you could

5675.84 --> 5682.179
escape the claws of the banking system

5679.3 --> 5685.06
in the fiat currency [ __ ]

5682.179 --> 5688.2390000000005
it's directly dependent on the bankers

5685.06 --> 5691.54
directly for having any kind of value as

5688.239 --> 5693.459999999999
soon as the bank says eh there goes the

5691.54 --> 5697.06
value

5693.46 --> 5699.88
it's just another form of fiat currency

5697.06 --> 5701.92
it's the next step it's fiat currency

5699.88 --> 5704.8
digital

5701.92 --> 5707.86
digitally a digital product instead but

5704.8 --> 5710.860000000001
it's still if the bank doesn't attribute

5707.86 --> 5713.259999999999
value then it has no value

5710.86 --> 5716.339999999999
unless you can convince somebody else

5713.26 --> 5720.159000000001
that it has value and then it has value

5716.34 --> 5722.5
between the two of you and that is it

5720.159 --> 5724.599999999999
yeah

5722.5 --> 5726.52
I believe Bankers created crippy you bet

5724.6 --> 5729.4800000000005
your ass they did

5726.52 --> 5729.4800000000005
absolutely did it

5734.92 --> 5742.8
that's right Bankers did create crypto

5738.639 --> 5742.8
it's the new fiat currency

5743.739 --> 5746.58
it's the next level

5748.84 --> 5754.860000000001
I think scammers created who thinks who

5751.42 --> 5754.86
do you think created the banks

5755.44 --> 5758.159
scammers

5758.8 --> 5762.639
what do you think they did with the gold

5760.659 --> 5765.638999999999
standard Banks earlier

5762.639 --> 5769.2390000000005
they lent out more money than they had

5765.639 --> 5772.4800000000005
then they got more interest out of that

5769.239 --> 5774.28
then because they lent out things that

5772.48 --> 5776.919999999999
they didn't even have yeah that's what

5774.28 --> 5779.5
scammers do then you got Bank runs and

5776.92 --> 5783.159
then they got killed for it for their

5779.5 --> 5785.86
scamming yeah it never changed guys it's

5783.159 --> 5787.719
Bankers are still scammers they're still

5785.86 --> 5789.339999999999
always trying to make more money than

5787.719 --> 5791.9800000000005
they should be

5789.34 --> 5793.179
or not even making money anymore because

5791.98 --> 5795.159
it doesn't matter it's just about

5793.179 --> 5798.159
control then

5795.159 --> 5799.839999999999
right when there's money it isn't really

5798.159 --> 5801.699
worth anything anymore because you could

5799.84 --> 5804.52
just print it out of nothing

5801.699 --> 5808.659
then it doesn't then the power

5804.52 --> 5810.34
isn't about the money anymore it's about

5808.659 --> 5813.04
how

5810.34 --> 5815.139
money is used

5813.04 --> 5818.199
and then how can you

5815.139 --> 5820.3
control how money is used so it becomes

5818.199 --> 5822.04
about the power and bankers care more

5820.3 --> 5824.5
about power than they do money the

5822.04 --> 5827.26
bankers don't need to make money they

5824.5 --> 5829.96
need to create power

5827.26 --> 5832.4800000000005
they need to have power over others over

5829.96 --> 5835.179
others labor over where they're gonna go

5832.48 --> 5839.199
with their lives that's what they try to

5835.179 --> 5841.54
get out of it control Power

5839.199 --> 5843.82
because money itself isn't really worth

5841.54 --> 5846.9
anything anymore

5843.82 --> 5846.9
it's just a tool

5849.76 --> 5853.84
just can't reuse it and bankers created

5851.8 --> 5857.58
this game yeah it's all the same thing

5853.84 --> 5857.58
Dr Ruth gear it's all the same

5857.739 --> 5861.299999999999
right

5859.0 --> 5864.82
I mean interest rate

5861.3 --> 5868.26
is is a scam

5864.82 --> 5868.259999999999
it's the original scam

5868.719 --> 5873.06
usury

5870.639 --> 5876.28
I mean it's literally

5873.06 --> 5880.8
highlighted by the Bible

5876.28 --> 5880.8
as like that's bad user is bad

5882.34 --> 5885.6
because it is

5899.139 --> 5902.7390000000005
of course they help people could get

5900.76 --> 5905.56
back into burning absolutely they could

5902.739 --> 5907.0
get back into bartering I mean the US is

5905.56 --> 5908.92
still like

5907.0 --> 5911.5
the economy is never really gonna go

5908.92 --> 5914.4400000000005
away it's just that

5911.5 --> 5917.8
once the dollar Falls well there goes

5914.44 --> 5920.199
all your convenient internationally

5917.8 --> 5922.659000000001
produced products that's the thing to go

5920.199 --> 5924.159
right because you can barter your

5922.659 --> 5927.28
services

5924.159 --> 5928.54
your resources like would you chop or

5927.28 --> 5930.88
something right

5928.54 --> 5931.9
you can all barter that of food you

5930.88 --> 5936.6990000000005
produce

5931.9 --> 5938.799999999999
but yeah don't count on any like high

5936.699 --> 5940.839999999999
quality computer parts

5938.8 --> 5943.06
being readily available

5940.84 --> 5945.04
yeah that's the thing that's going to go

5943.06 --> 5948.34
you can still trade you can still create

5945.04 --> 5951.6
food basic resources but it's like the

5948.34 --> 5951.6
complicated things

5951.82 --> 5957.34
that once the dollar goes those things

5954.76 --> 5959.320000000001
go because those things could only be

5957.34 --> 5961.6
traded through the currency

5959.32 --> 5964.599999999999
internationally

5961.6 --> 5969.4800000000005
right unless you want to create a

5964.6 --> 5972.76
computer chip factory and computer

5969.48 --> 5975.638999999999
assembly Factory in the United States

5972.76 --> 5977.92
and like really make work of it

5975.639 --> 5980.4400000000005
you can just forget about having

5977.92 --> 5981.76
computers readily available after the

5980.44 --> 5983.62
dollar Falls

5981.76 --> 5984.88
like only the things that are like

5983.62 --> 5987.46
produced

5984.88 --> 5990.82
on your soil

5987.46 --> 5993.46
will be readily available

5990.82 --> 5996.04
because the dollar system is what makes

5993.46 --> 5998.44
this International Trade thing

5996.04 --> 6001.0199999999995
happen and thereby

5998.44 --> 6003.839999999999
complicated products readily available

6001.02 --> 6007.5
for relatively little money that's what

6003.84 --> 6010.38
the dollar scan enables once it falls

6007.5 --> 6013.199
all of that convenience goes away now

6010.38 --> 6015.0
that becomes extremely expensive

6013.199 --> 6017.099999999999
because now

6015.0 --> 6019.26
the trade is going to be much tougher

6017.1 --> 6022.26
the logistics are going to cost are

6019.26 --> 6024.780000000001
going to go way up increasing the price

6022.26 --> 6027.0
like import those things are produced

6024.78 --> 6029.82
abroad while the import is going to be

6027.0 --> 6032.46
massive then once the dollar goes that's

6029.82 --> 6035.599999999999
how this works

6032.46 --> 6035.6
so realize that

6035.94 --> 6042.54
yes the GTI thing you talk about crypto

6039.179 --> 6045.679
like Bitcoin no no it's not it's an

6042.54 --> 6045.679
internal crypto thing

6056.58 --> 6061.8
they may finally be moving are you

6059.88 --> 6064.7390000000005
kidding me blue pill definitely you're

6061.8 --> 6067.7390000000005
looking forward to that

6064.739 --> 6070.159
now international monetary fund is a

6067.739 --> 6070.159
disaster

6071.219 --> 6075.96
I mean the international monetary fund

6073.679 --> 6078.62
is way worse

6075.96 --> 6081.12
than the Federal Reserve dude

6078.62 --> 6083.659
way worse

6081.12 --> 6083.659
okay

6086.639 --> 6091.5
I mean the Federal Reserve at least is

6089.219 --> 6093.179
like

6091.5 --> 6097.139
like they

6093.179 --> 6099.42
they really care about the nation

6097.139 --> 6101.219
surprisingly enough you would say like

6099.42 --> 6103.32
oh no that's not really true they're all

6101.219 --> 6106.38
just with the other Bankers well they

6103.32 --> 6108.9
have a United States centralist

6106.38 --> 6111.92
way of of doing things

6108.9 --> 6115.5599999999995
go international monetary fund is like

6111.92 --> 6118.28
extremely anti-national like they are

6115.56 --> 6121.26
full-on it's a full-on Marxist Bank okay

6118.28 --> 6122.46
Federal Reserve is not a fall on Marxist

6121.26 --> 6125.219
Bank

6122.46 --> 6128.04
I mean they're not great but at least

6125.219 --> 6130.76
they're not the freaking IMF IMF is like

6128.04 --> 6130.76
the worst

6132.96 --> 6138.38
IMF like deals with third world

6135.659 --> 6138.379999999999
dictators

6138.659 --> 6143.659
they help third world dictators into

6141.239 --> 6143.659
power

6144.54 --> 6150.5
IMF is [ __ ] up

6146.76 --> 6150.5
really really bad

6158.94 --> 6163.919999999999
like the IMF is like one of those

6161.46 --> 6167.4
corporations

6163.92 --> 6169.86
or well a banking system that is like a

6167.4 --> 6173.46
typical operation procedure that's very

6169.86 --> 6176.94
similar to Blackrock and Vanguard yeah

6173.46 --> 6180.3
they like commit genocide

6176.94 --> 6182.219
IMF like contributes to the committing

6180.3 --> 6186.139
of genocide

6182.219 --> 6186.139
for profits and control

6196.739 --> 6201.718999999999
right I mean if the IMF gets involved in

6199.98 --> 6204.239
something in a country

6201.719 --> 6208.28
well you better prepare yourself because

6204.239 --> 6211.138999999999
that usually means that within a

6208.28 --> 6213.92
foreseeable time

6211.139 --> 6217.139
for a within a certain period of time

6213.92 --> 6219.2390000000005
situation is going to build up to lead

6217.139 --> 6222.3
to a genocide because that's usually

6219.239 --> 6226.98
what happens when the IMF gets involved

6222.3 --> 6229.4400000000005
you might take notice of that yeah

6226.98 --> 6231.659
just look at their history why did they

6229.44 --> 6233.638999999999
get involved when and then look at what

6231.659 --> 6235.86
happened at those places after they got

6233.639 --> 6239.400000000001
involved how much time did that take

6235.86 --> 6241.139
before it got into total Civil War and

6239.4 --> 6243.239
hundreds of thousands of people suddenly

6241.139 --> 6246.42
get killed

6243.239 --> 6249.659
look at how many times the IMF is

6246.42 --> 6252.3
getting involved with such a place

6249.659 --> 6254.94
a certain period of time before said

6252.3 --> 6257.719
genocide starts happening

6254.94 --> 6257.719
look at it

6257.82 --> 6263.34
just count the numbers

6259.739 --> 6264.9
I'm not gonna do it but I know that

6263.34 --> 6267.84
there's people out there watching that

6264.9 --> 6269.94
can do that take a look at it

6267.84 --> 6272.52
you'll see

6269.94 --> 6275.04
whatever the IMF gets involved

6272.52 --> 6279.0
it's a big chance that some form of

6275.04 --> 6282.32
genocide is going to roll out of that

6279.0 --> 6286.5
because they are a international

6282.32 --> 6291.259999999999
Marxist type banking organization

6286.5 --> 6291.26
they destroy Nations for money

6291.78 --> 6297.239
like they bribe people to destroy

6294.6 --> 6299.76
Nations for money like oh here's your

6297.239 --> 6302.54
money now you have to do this and that

6299.76 --> 6302.54
in that country

6303.659 --> 6307.92
and then you get the money so you can

6305.699 --> 6309.659
maintain control with your weapons and

6307.92 --> 6311.9400000000005
your trucks and whatever

6309.659 --> 6314.879999999999
and and yeah you get to roll out the

6311.94 --> 6317.5199999999995
Marxist agenda on everybody with the

6314.88 --> 6320.52
money we gave you guess what's gonna

6317.52 --> 6324.780000000001
eventually roll out of that yay More

6320.52 --> 6327.38
Death more genocide more democide yeah

6324.78 --> 6331.32
thank you IMF thank you so much for

6327.38 --> 6333.659000000001
helping out the poor Nations

6331.32 --> 6337.259999999999
thank you so much for helping them out

6333.659 --> 6339.96
by sponsoring anti-human dictators that

6337.26 --> 6340.92
will slaughter their own people for your

6339.96 --> 6343.619
little

6340.92 --> 6349.34
printed out of nothing money thank you

6343.619 --> 6349.339999999999
so much IMF for your fabulous assistance

6358.219 --> 6364.02
so by all means look it up IMF when what

6362.219 --> 6365.94
have they actually been doing where did

6364.02 --> 6369.1990000000005
they get involved how many people died

6365.94 --> 6369.199
after they got involved

6378.36 --> 6386.119
have a penny from 1980

6381.6 --> 6386.119000000001
50 bucks wow that's crazy

6390.96 --> 6395.2390000000005
that's one hell of a lucky penny

6410.46 --> 6416.34
the Euro might be integrated with it I

6413.4 --> 6420.98
don't know Dr utker it's a giant mess

6416.34 --> 6420.9800000000005
part of the Marshall Plan what

6421.739 --> 6425.4
okay

6423.659 --> 6426.78
not sure what you're talking about I

6425.4 --> 6430.138999999999
know what the Marshall Plan is but I

6426.78 --> 6432.719
don't know but the euro is like a

6430.139 --> 6434.34
it's not that old the Euro project it

6432.719 --> 6437.719
was late 90s I don't think it was

6434.34 --> 6437.719
involved with the Marshall Plan

6440.82 --> 6447.36
but I mean I don't know a lot how long

6443.76 --> 6450.42
the European Union's even gonna be

6447.36 --> 6453.0
like a thing

6450.42 --> 6454.7390000000005
they're rolling out stuff Lao in the

6453.0 --> 6456.3
Netherlands that they're announcing that

6454.739 --> 6458.04
there's going to be happening because of

6456.3 --> 6461.52
European rules

6458.04 --> 6463.619
and like they're gonna like up the taxes

6461.52 --> 6466.02
they actually want to put like a hundred

6463.619 --> 6468.599999999999
percent water tax

6466.02 --> 6470.6990000000005
like double the amount of water tax it's

6468.6 --> 6473.159000000001
just in the Netherlands the land where

6470.699 --> 6475.5599999999995
freaking Waters everywhere

6473.159 --> 6478.138999999999
it's insane they literally like want to

6475.56 --> 6480.5
tax everything out of existence just

6478.139 --> 6483.96
make it like

6480.5 --> 6487.08
calculably impossible

6483.96 --> 6489.119
to own anything

6487.08 --> 6492.719
it's like yeah when you add up the

6489.119 --> 6495.48
numbers and the taxes you literally will

6492.719 --> 6497.52
not be able to own anything like they're

6495.48 --> 6499.678999999999
trying to do that and there's a good

6497.52 --> 6502.92
chance that the Netherlands will

6499.679 --> 6505.02
actually like disassemble

6502.92 --> 6508.5
like they they will step out of the

6505.02 --> 6512.820000000001
European Union this way because

6508.5 --> 6515.1
like nobody wants that like we we're one

6512.82 --> 6516.659
of the richest countries of the

6515.1 --> 6521.6990000000005
continent

6516.659 --> 6523.86
and like nobody wants to just like oh

6521.699 --> 6526.5599999999995
let's just give up everything we have

6523.86 --> 6529.259999999999
all our power all our wealth all our

6526.56 --> 6533.219
culture everything just so a bunch of

6529.26 --> 6535.92
[ __ ] up Nazi megalomaniacal freaks can

6533.219 --> 6537.119
have absolute power yeah how about we

6535.92 --> 6541.4400000000005
don't

6537.119 --> 6543.36
how about we don't play a part of that

6541.44 --> 6545.219
we don't want to we don't want to be

6543.36 --> 6547.92
part of this [ __ ] up European

6545.219 --> 6551.1
implosion anymore we're the Netherlands

6547.92 --> 6553.92
we [ __ ] invented banking

6551.1 --> 6558.360000000001
we're gonna burn everything down before

6553.92 --> 6560.82
we're gonna be Banker slaves

6558.36 --> 6563.54
slaves to Banks

6560.82 --> 6565.92
that isn't even like our of our nation

6563.54 --> 6568.0199999999995
like if we're going to be a slave to

6565.92 --> 6570.6
bank it's going to be the bank of our

6568.02 --> 6574.5
country here we're not gonna get

6570.6 --> 6577.5
enslaved to a a foreign Bank [ __ ] you

6574.5 --> 6580.679
we're Dutch we don't allow ourselves to

6577.5 --> 6585.42
get enslaved by Foreign Banks we get

6580.679 --> 6588.8
enslaved by our National Bank yeah [ __ ]

6585.42 --> 6588.8
that's how we work

6589.92 --> 6593.34
yeah Netherlands invented banking that's

6592.02 --> 6596.4800000000005
right

6593.34 --> 6596.4800000000005
officially anyway

6598.92 --> 6604.02
really

6601.679 --> 6605.76
I mean that's like Mainline history it

6604.02 --> 6608.1
might not be correct

6605.76 --> 6610.320000000001
I I couldn't argue with that like yeah

6608.1 --> 6612.0
sure I'm sure that it's not the first

6610.32 --> 6613.38
time banking has actually been invented

6612.0 --> 6615.719
but officially that's like the

6613.38 --> 6618.38
Netherlands invented banking

6615.719 --> 6618.38
that's it

6623.34 --> 6626.34
thanks

6632.34 --> 6636.719
I thought it was yeah of course you

6634.199 --> 6639.5599999999995
thought that it was wrong though

6636.719 --> 6643.9800000000005
Netherlands invented banking yeah

6639.56 --> 6646.6990000000005
banking is what enabled

6643.98 --> 6650.638999999999
the Dutch East Indian company yeah the

6646.699 --> 6654.48
Dutch East Indian company we started

6650.639 --> 6656.36
that with banking which enabled the

6654.48 --> 6662.759999999999
Dutch East Indian company

6656.36 --> 6664.619
and then afterward England took over

6662.76 --> 6667.679
and turned it into the British Empire

6664.619 --> 6670.5599999999995
you didn't invent it you didn't invent

6667.679 --> 6673.38
Banking and you didn't invent the east

6670.56 --> 6676.219
Indian Dutch company yeah

6673.38 --> 6676.219
we did

6677.94 --> 6684.619
you just invented English which is a

6681.84 --> 6684.619000000001
pretty cool language

6687.78 --> 6692.119
the First Bank was in Italy

6692.219 --> 6698.159
yeah but it's not the same though

6695.699 --> 6701.299999999999
it wasn't like a

6698.159 --> 6701.299999999999
National Bank

6701.52 --> 6709.139
like the Netherlands really

6705.659 --> 6712.0199999999995
made it into like an industrial thing

6709.139 --> 6714.36
where like anybody can

6712.02 --> 6716.280000000001
like work with banks and there would be

6714.36 --> 6718.5599999999995
it would be feasible

6716.28 --> 6720.78
like it's not like oh you take a loan

6718.56 --> 6723.900000000001
from the bank and you're now bust

6720.78 --> 6726.179
guaranteed no not at all it was like

6723.9 --> 6728.58
definitely a profitable thing back then

6726.179 --> 6730.32
it's like you can borrow money you can

6728.58 --> 6732.659
make more money with that and then you

6730.32 --> 6734.28
pay it back and then it's a win-win like

6732.659 --> 6735.42
that's actually how banking's supposed

6734.28 --> 6737.4
to work

6735.42 --> 6739.38
and we're very strict on that and the

6737.4 --> 6742.32
Netherlands like made it into a big

6739.38 --> 6744.54
thing I'm sure that Italy had the first

6742.32 --> 6747.0599999999995
Banker or whatever

6744.54 --> 6750.179
but they didn't like industrialize it

6747.06 --> 6753.659000000001
which is what the Netherlands did and

6750.179 --> 6756.54
that's how the East Indian company

6753.659 --> 6760.04
came into being it came out of that

6756.54 --> 6760.04
standardized banking thing

6762.38 --> 6766.56
yeah I know space comma that's why I

6765.42 --> 6770.04
said

6766.56 --> 6774.619000000001
sure that there's other places you could

6770.04 --> 6774.619
trace back banking to way before that

6775.5 --> 6780.42
Sweden that the first yeah that's very

6777.9 --> 6781.86
cool yeah well in history class I

6780.42 --> 6784.1
learned that the Netherlands had the

6781.86 --> 6787.199
first bank

6784.1 --> 6789.06
Civilization games say the same yeah

6787.199 --> 6791.759999999999
they also say that America is the first

6789.06 --> 6794.46
to land on the moon I don't give a [ __ ]

6791.76 --> 6797.42
Netherlands has banking it's official I

6794.46 --> 6800.1
don't care if it's not real

6797.42 --> 6802.4400000000005
I'm sure somebody else invented it I'm

6800.1 --> 6803.9400000000005
sure Satan originally invented banking

6802.44 --> 6805.699
when he fell to Earth

6803.94 --> 6809.4
okay

6805.699 --> 6812.58
but historically in the history books

6809.4 --> 6814.679
the Freemasons agree that it was the

6812.58 --> 6816.92
Dutch that invented banking now get over

6814.679 --> 6816.92
it

6822.06 --> 6827.400000000001
that's right Dr hooker we industrialized

6824.76 --> 6829.7390000000005
the banking system so made it into a

6827.4 --> 6832.138999999999
real thing into an industry instead of

6829.739 --> 6835.58
just one guy being really stinky rich

6832.139 --> 6835.58
and doing something with his money

6837.48 --> 6840.48
ah

6840.9 --> 6847.099999999999
let's go with your school history that's

6843.84 --> 6847.1
never been shown to be wrong

6849.0 --> 6851.54
look

6852.02 --> 6858.02
it doesn't matter

6855.42 --> 6858.02
is

6858.48 --> 6861.08
I mean

6862.38 --> 6867.659000000001
Dr utker already said it we

6865.08 --> 6871.1
industrialized banking

6867.659 --> 6874.199
which is like actual banking

6871.1 --> 6876.4800000000005
it's what made the Dutch East Indian

6874.199 --> 6878.9
company possible

6876.48 --> 6878.9
okay

6884.52 --> 6888.540000000001
it's taught you nothing about banking in

6886.56 --> 6890.52
school you probably didn't have a very

6888.54 --> 6893.9
good school then

6890.52 --> 6893.900000000001
because they did with me

6913.08 --> 6917.82
I am still remembering history

6916.02 --> 6920.34
when there was like stuff about the

6917.82 --> 6923.099999999999
Holocaust it was so [ __ ] annoying

6920.34 --> 6925.38
because I had like I just wanted to ask

6923.1 --> 6926.6990000000005
questions it's like yeah I don't care if

6925.38 --> 6928.92
that makes me sound like a doctor

6926.699 --> 6931.138999999999
mangala I just have questions I just

6928.92 --> 6932.76
want to know more but then there were

6931.139 --> 6934.56
all these people in the class that were

6932.76 --> 6938.06
getting all they were literally get

6934.56 --> 6938.06
jittery and shaking

6938.52 --> 6944.76
by just questions being asked So

6941.46 --> 6946.9800000000005
eventually I was like I just got kicked

6944.76 --> 6951.320000000001
out of class

6946.98 --> 6951.32
because every they were all like

6952.26 --> 6956.400000000001
my grandmother

6954.36 --> 6959.4
like

6956.4 --> 6961.739
I just want to know about it I want to

6959.4 --> 6963.78
know more details I want to see what

6961.739 --> 6966.48
happened

6963.78 --> 6971.3
but you can't ask anything about it

6966.48 --> 6971.299999999999
cannot question the shoe that's right

6972.78 --> 6980.46
or or the logistics right

6977.159 --> 6982.5599999999995
so like how did six million people get

6980.46 --> 6984.9
there

6982.56 --> 6987.84
and then how were they all burned I mean

6984.9 --> 6989.4
six million is a lot like where's all

6987.84 --> 6992.58
the remains

6989.4 --> 6994.619
where's all the all the the clothes all

6992.58 --> 6997.4
that where is it

6994.619 --> 6999.78
like where's the mass Graves

6997.4 --> 7003.339999999999
how dare you

6999.78 --> 7003.34
are you white supremacist

7003.44 --> 7007.36
okay I just wanna know

7009.02 --> 7014.659000000001
it's like yeah well hey use that I

7013.1 --> 7016.2390000000005
assumed they were they probably were

7014.659 --> 7018.32
there were plenty of Jews on that school

7016.239 --> 7021.5599999999995
so yeah

7018.32 --> 7026.0599999999995
wouldn't you want to know every single

7021.56 --> 7028.52
detail to help prevent another alleged

7026.06 --> 7031.280000000001
Holocaust from happening wouldn't you

7028.52 --> 7033.860000000001
want to investigate every single detail

7031.28 --> 7035.78
about it to prevent it from happening

7033.86 --> 7040.96
again

7035.78 --> 7040.96
but no they just got really angry

7050.9 --> 7055.239
the Roman Empire was the greatest thing

7059.0 --> 7063.139
right anyway I'm gonna round out the

7061.159 --> 7065.659
show I think I still have to make up a
