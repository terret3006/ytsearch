right and also yeah I wanted to thank

99.619 --> 104.46
Patricia Dockery

102.42 --> 106.32000000000001
he's not a regular chat visitor but I

104.46 --> 108.17999999999999
know she does follow my show and she

106.32 --> 109.439
sends PayPal support

108.18 --> 112.74000000000001
like

109.439 --> 115.5
early yesterday or the day before even I

112.74 --> 120.29899999999999
forgot to shout her out

115.5 --> 123.299
five bucks but I mean every bit helps

120.299 --> 126.42
right anyway

123.299 --> 128.28
whether today is kind of the same as

126.42 --> 131.64000000000001
yesterday it's

128.28 --> 134.4
just a little Little Misty

131.64 --> 137.64
gray soup up there

134.4 --> 140.54
completely immersed it's not clouds it's

137.64 --> 140.54
just great soup

141.3 --> 147.0
and almost no wind

143.83 --> 150.42000000000002
[Music]

147.0 --> 152.16
no more snow it's all completely melted

150.42 --> 154.55999999999997
away everything

152.16 --> 158.34
and it's still cool I bet it's still

154.56 --> 161.12
like one or two degrees or something

158.34 --> 161.12
water cold

166.739 --> 172.8
right

168.66 --> 175.57999999999998
hello Dr Bass awkwards first in chat

172.8 --> 175.58
good to see you man

176.04 --> 178.7
how are you doing

179.519 --> 182.18
good

182.94 --> 187.7
no

185.099 --> 187.7
foreign

190.8 --> 196.56
Wednesday the 25th of January 2023

199.019 --> 204.86
let's check the temperature see if I was

202.62 --> 204.86
right

205.86 --> 210.0
one degree Celsius yep

214.8 --> 222.37900000000002
temperature is going to go up a little

217.56 --> 222.379
coming week according to the forecast

223.14 --> 226.94
with potentially some sun

227.64 --> 232.16
from Thursday to Saturday that would be

230.819 --> 235.36999999999998
nice

232.16 --> 235.37
[Music]

239.28 --> 243.48
rearranging your downstairs and your

241.14 --> 246.35999999999999
cats are getting yeah they always do get

243.48 --> 249.659
like what's what's happening

246.36 --> 252.20000000000002
things are changing

249.659 --> 252.2
all right

254.0 --> 258.6
I have to reprogram their orientation of

257.4 --> 260.82
the environment

258.6 --> 264.18
because they have like a

260.82 --> 266.4
an entire blueprint of the area

264.18 --> 268.02
that they eventually memorize so they

266.4 --> 271.13899999999995
don't have to actually consciously

268.02 --> 273.0
observe they just go by memory of how it

271.139 --> 276.3
is

273.0 --> 278.94
where like where you can go

276.3 --> 281.40000000000003
etc etc

278.94 --> 283.44
did you know that

281.4 --> 285.9
so if you then suddenly things get

283.44 --> 288.36
seriously rearranged to them it's like

285.9 --> 290.52
an earthquake they have to everything is

288.36 --> 292.62
just like all over the place

290.52 --> 294.24
now I have to re-figure out how things

292.62 --> 298.1
work now

294.24 --> 298.1
like what the area is like now

299.52 --> 305.18
yeah they're new little holes and all

301.5 --> 305.18
that hiding places yeah

307.139 --> 311.94
it's kind of funny because in a way I

309.06 --> 314.28000000000003
work the same or probably all people

311.94 --> 315.78
work like that but I'm just very aware

314.28 --> 318.35999999999996
of it

315.78 --> 319.85999999999996
so I always find moving very

318.36 --> 323.759
uncomfortable

319.86 --> 326.0
like I feel extremely high on edge and

323.759 --> 326.0
like

326.039 --> 331.74
it's not irritable but just

328.259 --> 333.96000000000004
nervous I might I get easier more easily

331.74 --> 336.86
nervous breakdowns

333.96 --> 336.85999999999996
it's very annoying

336.9 --> 341.94
it was very challenging when I first

339.0 --> 344.6
moved in with my ex but I did actually

341.94 --> 344.6
pull through

345.96 --> 350.35999999999996
[Music]

347.759 --> 352.44
a very serious

350.36 --> 354.84000000000003
idiotic moments

352.44 --> 358.16
other than just personal internal

354.84 --> 358.15999999999997
humiliation Sensations

359.4 --> 363.96
anyway

360.84 --> 365.58
but yeah cats they don't like moving at

363.96 --> 368.82
all

365.58 --> 371.4
oh you got it like with my cat

368.82 --> 375.02
when I move yeah you gotta lock them up

371.4 --> 375.02
in one room first for a Time

376.74 --> 382.74
like at least for a day

380.34 --> 385.31899999999996
and then eventually like you let them

382.74 --> 387.12
out and then they can Orient themselves

385.319 --> 389.34000000000003
in the house

387.12 --> 391.62
and then

389.34 --> 393.19899999999996
after you've noticed that they're

391.62 --> 396.419
already like

393.199 --> 398.34000000000003
explored the whole place and like find

396.419 --> 400.56
their places they like to sit and all

398.34 --> 402.78
that when they start to perform like

400.56 --> 405.3
domesticated Behavior that's when you

402.78 --> 409.02
can try

405.3 --> 412.52000000000004
under guidance to let them out

409.02 --> 412.52
but not let them wander off

413.94 --> 418.8
right because if you like hurry that up

416.4 --> 420.35999999999996
if you do that too quickly they will

418.8 --> 424.16
literally just

420.36 --> 424.16
if you let them out they will just run

425.699 --> 430.38
are they sometimes either they just

428.22 --> 433.08000000000004
don't want to go outside they're scared

430.38 --> 436.759
or they'll just like run outside if you

433.08 --> 436.75899999999996
if you let them out too quickly yeah

438.77 --> 443.01
[Music]

445.5 --> 448.4
all right

450.78 --> 454.52
yeah but when you rearrange

455.28 --> 460.57
they get confused

457.52 --> 460.57
[Music]

466.44 --> 470.479
right anyway yeah I got this title

471.18 --> 476.639
grafted in last minute I was because of

473.699 --> 479.819
watching Quantum of conscious at a great

476.639 --> 481.8
video I left a comment and was talking

479.819 --> 485.41900000000004
about

481.8 --> 487.86
uh well simulacra

485.419 --> 490.85999999999996
simulacrum and something concept that

487.86 --> 492.84000000000003
I'm very well familiar with if not just

490.86 --> 495.38
through Dungeons and Dragons where that

492.84 --> 495.38
is a spell

496.319 --> 502.139
it creates a

498.62 --> 505.379
projected version of yourself

502.139 --> 508.44
that is like two-thirds of your total

505.379 --> 510.90000000000003
level and everything you got

508.44 --> 513.599
including items but they're all like

510.9 --> 516.4789999999999
astral projections in a way

513.599 --> 519.0
so as soon as the spell ends because it

516.479 --> 522.719
has a temporary duration everything that

519.0 --> 523.86
was projected within goes

522.719 --> 526.74
thank you

523.86 --> 529.5600000000001
but yeah that's how I first got

526.74 --> 531.6
introduced that word but he brought

529.56 --> 533.3389999999999
forth like somebody that wrote a book

531.6 --> 535.2
about it

533.339 --> 538.2
about how

535.2 --> 541.38
basically there's an entropy cycle the

538.2 --> 544.86
things and like even

541.38 --> 548.3389999999999
with like public consciousness

544.86 --> 549.899
like every like a new model is made with

548.339 --> 552.1800000000001
what you got left

549.899 --> 554.58
of how to do everything and then new

552.18 --> 556.68
things also Sprout up I think that's

554.58 --> 560.0
probably a bit overlooked within the

556.68 --> 560.0
philosophizing of it

560.04 --> 567.24
and then eventually that is the new

563.94 --> 568.5
format of what everybody's used to how

567.24 --> 570.66
things work

568.5 --> 573.48
and then eventually like newer

570.66 --> 575.8199999999999
Generations in there it's things change

573.48 --> 577.98
around and then

575.82 --> 581.4590000000001
it does gets chaotic it doesn't work

577.98 --> 586.38
anymore then a new format

581.459 --> 589.6199999999999
will be devised but it will also be

586.38 --> 592.019
grown out of the previous version and

589.62 --> 593.58
that's a simulacrum effect where

592.019 --> 596.399
basically

593.58 --> 599.58
the longer things go in in modern

596.399 --> 602.7
society the more things will

599.58 --> 605.58
grow into like a mechanistic way of

602.7 --> 609.24
going about completely forgetting the

605.58 --> 611.94
Origins on which it all grew

609.24 --> 614.04
it's very fascinating

611.94 --> 616.5600000000001
and that yeah immediately reminds me

614.04 --> 619.86
about things that I've said in the past

616.56 --> 622.3199999999999
about the entropy of the Earthly

619.86 --> 625.6800000000001
or I never really call it that but like

622.32 --> 628.019
how our ancestors are we're all Giants

625.68 --> 629.8199999999999
like all of us like that those were the

628.019 --> 633.0600000000001
humans

629.82 --> 635.339
and that over very long periods of time

633.06 --> 638.64
over the generations

635.339 --> 640.86
people just become smaller and smaller

638.64 --> 645.38
and then the bigger ones just become

640.86 --> 645.38
less and less and then they stop

645.779 --> 651.6
they stop procreating

648.48 --> 654.1800000000001
while some even smaller and smaller that

651.6 --> 655.8000000000001
would before have seen been seen as like

654.18 --> 659.8199999999999
freakishly small not talking about

655.8 --> 662.88
dwarfism but just like scaled down like

659.82 --> 665.22
completely smaller

662.88 --> 667.68
and that then

665.22 --> 670.019
became more normal and normal and normal

667.68 --> 671.8199999999999
and then everybody's like that now

670.019 --> 674.22
that's the normal and now everybody's

671.82 --> 676.2
that's bigger it's like a giant right

674.22 --> 679.26
and that keeps happening but it takes

676.2 --> 681.0600000000001
very long times

679.26 --> 683.04
unless there's literally like

681.06 --> 684.779
slaughtering events where because I

683.04 --> 687.5999999999999
think there have been events over

684.779 --> 691.079
history where eventually like

687.6 --> 692.76
the smaller ones just start Waging War

691.079 --> 695.64
against the big ones the war on the

692.76 --> 697.8
Giants like as I've described in my

695.64 --> 699.3
timeline

697.8 --> 702.7199999999999
story

699.3 --> 705.5999999999999
the the post Atlantean era

702.72 --> 708.12
where the humans yeah what I call the

705.6 --> 710.22
humans but basically the smaller newer

708.12 --> 713.1
Generations

710.22 --> 716.64
decide that theirs is the only ones and

713.1 --> 720.3000000000001
start hunting down and censoring Giants

716.64 --> 723.0
and then eventually ending up replacing

720.3 --> 726.26
the entire history story the age of

723.0 --> 726.26
Illusion starts then

726.86 --> 733.5600000000001
right it all fits together

730.8 --> 736.019
right but at the same time there's a

733.56 --> 739.26
counter movement that is overlooked by

736.019 --> 742.1
this by this entropy

739.26 --> 745.74
and by the philosophy of the simulacrum

742.1 --> 747.899
and that is that the spirit

745.74 --> 751.0790000000001
whatever that is

747.899 --> 754.68
the spirit that arises on top of this

751.079 --> 758.459
vessel over the generations has become

754.68 --> 760.3199999999999
more complex more quick more Dynamic it

758.459 --> 761.66
has evolved it's so ironic right

760.32 --> 764.1600000000001
Evolution

761.66 --> 766.139
biological evolution is complete

764.16 --> 770.3389999999999
horseshit

766.139 --> 773.5790000000001
it is absolutely unproven horse [ __ ]

770.339 --> 776.5790000000001
it's pathetic it's riddled with fraud

773.579 --> 778.519
throughout its historical buildup

776.579 --> 781.019
but

778.519 --> 784.98
the spirit

781.019 --> 787.74
the separated component yeah that's not

784.98 --> 792.839
even taken into account by materialists

787.74 --> 796.92
yeah that thing is evolving

792.839 --> 799.5
yeah it's like a counter effect it's the

796.92 --> 802.139
other side of the Earthly hey it's

799.5 --> 804.54
domain of God so it is actually

802.139 --> 807.779
evolving

804.54 --> 811.26
there's a reversed entropy and there's

807.779 --> 812.1
even reasoning as to why it happens like

811.26 --> 814.3199999999999
that

812.1 --> 816.66
it's because well Things become more

814.32 --> 819.4200000000001
difficult more strenuous

816.66 --> 822.3
and the spirit is then

819.42 --> 825.5999999999999
either yeah right the Consciousness the

822.3 --> 827.279
spirit it has to weigh it out and it's

825.6 --> 830.66
like yeah I don't want to do this

827.279 --> 833.9399999999999
anymore and then you die or

830.66 --> 837.959
you'll find a way through

833.94 --> 841.2
and you evolve spiritually even though

837.959 --> 843.4799999999999
your body may be like devolving

841.2 --> 845.7
and this concept

843.48 --> 848.519
should definitely be taken into account

845.7 --> 852.3000000000001
in this day and age very widely because

848.519 --> 855.0
it if you think of this then if you have

852.3 --> 857.88
been for example damaged by medical

855.0 --> 860.579
experiments

857.88 --> 863.459
you could be like I'm doomed I've got

860.579 --> 865.68
the mark of the beast oh no or I'm

863.459 --> 867.5999999999999
[ __ ] I can't do anything anymore and

865.68 --> 870.4799999999999
just give up and or become victim

867.6 --> 871.86
conscious based functioning

870.48 --> 876.54
or

871.86 --> 879.899
you could actually attempt to overcome

876.54 --> 883.56
the challenge by realizing that you made

879.899 --> 885.72
a mistake but that you don't

883.56 --> 888.8389999999999
underestimate God

885.72 --> 891.5400000000001
because you have an opportunity to

888.839 --> 894.24
basically because of the Devolution that

891.54 --> 896.8199999999999
your body has gone through to evolve

894.24 --> 899.66
with your spirit at least within your

896.82 --> 899.6600000000001
personal cycle

899.76 --> 905.519
it's a consolidation price I mean you

902.82 --> 907.0400000000001
probably will have trouble procreating

905.519 --> 911.519
Etc

907.04 --> 913.92
but within your life

911.519 --> 917.16
you might just have like this extra

913.92 --> 917.9399999999999
Notch it's like a consolidation prize of

917.16 --> 920.459
God

917.94 --> 924.3000000000001
but that's how you can see it

920.459 --> 927.0
or just like to balance out the

924.3 --> 928.38
Devolution the entropy

927.0 --> 930.899
[Music]

928.38 --> 932.279
it sounds a bit Gnostic probably or

930.899 --> 934.5
something I don't know what they

932.279 --> 935.279
actually talk about this is what I talk

934.5 --> 937.5
about

935.279 --> 940.5
because I don't follow no snakes out

937.5 --> 943.98
there I find them very disturbing and

940.5 --> 946.079
lower frequency primitive that I mean I

943.98 --> 948.1800000000001
don't learn anything from them

946.079 --> 949.9799999999999
they just try to Railroad me into

948.18 --> 952.92
thinking in a certain way I don't do

949.98 --> 954.839
that not like that not with like if I'm

952.92 --> 958.38
gonna railroad you something

954.839 --> 960.899
right there's gonna be a lot of bushes

958.38 --> 963.24
with great berries right along the track

960.899 --> 965.1
right that that's the only place I will

963.24 --> 967.26
railroad you because otherwise I don't

965.1 --> 968.279
do it I don't railroad anybody to the

967.26 --> 970.199
Doom

968.279 --> 973.9399999999999
or two

970.199 --> 973.9399999999999
closing off their eyes

974.04 --> 977.639
thank you

975.899 --> 981.12
all right anyway

977.639 --> 983.94
yeah they're rambling on

981.12 --> 986.22
kind of inspired

983.94 --> 989.0400000000001
hello Amanda Young

986.22 --> 993.1990000000001
Natura Wallace

989.04 --> 993.199
seeking star water yeah good to see you

1005.24 --> 1009.259
uh weight of the Soul yeah I've heard of

1007.459 --> 1012.8
that

1009.259 --> 1014.0
it's no real point to it though right

1012.8 --> 1016.459
you could

1014.0 --> 1018.68
to say that it's literally a substance

1016.459 --> 1020.42
or

1018.68 --> 1021.8599999999999
there's another way to approach it as

1020.42 --> 1026.4189999999999
well so you can start water and just say

1021.86 --> 1029.02
that Soul which is ethereal just Alters

1026.419 --> 1029.0200000000002
matter

1033.079 --> 1038.74
right

1035.12 --> 1041.36
it doesn't have weight but when it is

1038.74 --> 1045.319
imbued within

1041.36 --> 1047.059
flesh then that flash just has different

1045.319 --> 1048.799
properties because of it have you ever

1047.059 --> 1050.54
considered that

1048.799 --> 1052.7
view of it right

1050.54 --> 1055.6399999999999
because this entire thing of oh the soul

1052.7 --> 1058.52
has literal weight is just it's just

1055.64 --> 1060.22
that physicality assumption bias thing

1058.52 --> 1062.96
trying to

1060.22 --> 1064.039
materialize the spirit right oh it has

1062.96 --> 1068.38
weight

1064.039 --> 1068.3799999999999
trying to make it science it's pointless

1071.36 --> 1077.0
I mean you could think of spirit

1073.34 --> 1080.0
mechanics but that's not science it's

1077.0 --> 1080.0
esoteric

1080.36 --> 1084.34
either you get it or you don't

1091.76 --> 1096.82
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

1093.5 --> 1096.82
get the [ __ ] out of here

1099.2 --> 1105.1000000000001
in my heart what the [ __ ] are you

1101.48 --> 1105.1
blabbering about you [ __ ] with

1116.6 --> 1121.1
I just compared myself to gnostics I

1119.36 --> 1124.9399999999998
literally said I don't watch those

1121.1 --> 1128.84
people I just do what I do

1124.94 --> 1131.3600000000001
and I definitely respect Christ and God

1128.84 --> 1133.9399999999998
including god of the Bible it's a giant

1131.36 --> 1136.58
challenge to even figure out like

1133.94 --> 1139.24
what's going on there and and not just

1136.58 --> 1142.3999999999999
blindly surrender Like A cultist

1139.24 --> 1144.98
Satisfied that they'll be saved

1142.4 --> 1147.02
by some master because they are

1144.98 --> 1148.82
enslaving themselves to something they

1147.02 --> 1151.6399999999999
don't understand a couple of riddles

1148.82 --> 1153.9189999999999
that make no freaking sense that are

1151.64 --> 1156.74
esoteric in a way that they literally

1153.919 --> 1158.24
don't understand guess what if you don't

1156.74 --> 1161.36
understand

1158.24 --> 1163.28
the four implications of the chant that

1161.36 --> 1165.74
you say

1163.28 --> 1167.84
you just become deluded

1165.74 --> 1171.22
when you say it and then think it's all

1167.84 --> 1171.22
right yeah guess what you're wrong

1172.22 --> 1177.82
it's just blabbering yeah it's just

1174.98 --> 1177.82
magic words

1182.24 --> 1187.1
don't you go pretend

1187.28 --> 1192.62
like I'm some

1189.559 --> 1196.059
Satan is there that kind of nonsense I'm

1192.62 --> 1196.059
very much on the side of God

1197.84 --> 1205.34
[Music]

1200.9 --> 1208.94
but I will use any insights

1205.34 --> 1212.5
all of it because all information is of

1208.94 --> 1212.5
God all of it

1222.82 --> 1228.7
huh yeah that's a good stance now Dr

1225.559 --> 1228.7
Bass awkwards

1229.52 --> 1237.08
just trust God

1232.34 --> 1239.48
it's about whether you recognize it if

1237.08 --> 1241.6399999999999
you should always prioritize yourself in

1239.48 --> 1242.96
that sense right if somebody's saying

1241.64 --> 1245.2990000000002
something that

1242.96 --> 1246.919
just doesn't resonate with you

1245.299 --> 1249.679
well then don't

1246.919 --> 1252.5590000000002
don't accept that then

1249.679 --> 1254.96
if God's telling you something different

1252.559 --> 1258.44
right and even that it whether it's a

1254.96 --> 1261.679
mistake in that sense is matters less

1258.44 --> 1264.44
because if you take it serious then you

1261.679 --> 1266.24
will eventually figure out that maybe

1264.44 --> 1269.1200000000001
they were right after all you were just

1266.24 --> 1271.28
not ready to accept it yet you can't

1269.12 --> 1274.1789999999999
just blindly accept what somebody else

1271.28 --> 1274.1789999999999
says right

1279.98 --> 1286.22
so wait hoax yeah I've heard that too

1283.46 --> 1289.66
treaty

1286.22 --> 1289.66
and yeah it could be fake

1289.94 --> 1294.6200000000001
or it could be real what I'm saying is

1292.159 --> 1295.88
it's completely irrelevant and it is it

1294.62 --> 1298.039
feels

1295.88 --> 1302.96
the premise of it feels like somebody

1298.039 --> 1305.6589999999999
Desiring to physicalize

1302.96 --> 1308.3600000000001
like the spirit

1305.659 --> 1310.4
my information is still like oh we

1308.36 --> 1314.539
finally found the weight

1310.4 --> 1317.48
of information it's this many micrograms

1314.539 --> 1319.4
per word or something right or per verb

1317.48 --> 1322.34
like what

1319.4 --> 1324.8600000000001
come on that makes no sense it's it

1322.34 --> 1327.1589999999999
they're not compatible they they can't

1324.86 --> 1327.1589999999999
be

1327.5 --> 1331.7
but again if there was something that

1330.799 --> 1333.86
happened

1331.7 --> 1335.9
well then the then the supposed

1333.86 --> 1337.6999999999998
hypothesis of it was like oh it has

1335.9 --> 1339.44
weight oh it lost weight yeah that does

1337.7 --> 1342.0800000000002
that doesn't work that pseudoscience

1339.44 --> 1344.3600000000001
can't work but there may have been

1342.08 --> 1348.039
something that happened and a weight

1344.36 --> 1351.08
loss well I just gave an alternative

1348.039 --> 1353.919
non-scientific conception of how that

1351.08 --> 1353.9189999999999
might have occurred

1359.36 --> 1364.76
right

1361.64 --> 1367.419
I like doing that it's basically

1364.76 --> 1367.419
speculation

1367.64 --> 1372.5
it's like oh what if it happened well

1369.919 --> 1375.3200000000002
maybe it would have been that then

1372.5 --> 1378.38
right but the entire premise of

1375.32 --> 1380.98
Soul literally has weight is completely

1378.38 --> 1380.98
pointless

1385.9 --> 1392.6200000000001
right because if you were to materialize

1389.48 --> 1395.6
it yeah people will jump to oh it's

1392.62 --> 1397.82
electrical the soul is electricity our

1395.6 --> 1400.039
spirit is electricity or something right

1397.82 --> 1401.2
well it does have electricity have

1400.039 --> 1404.9
weight

1401.2 --> 1409.64
no no it doesn't everybody knows that

1404.9 --> 1412.22
in physics but electricity can have

1409.64 --> 1416.419
influence

1412.22 --> 1420.159
on the weight of material

1416.419 --> 1420.159
we also know that

1420.44 --> 1425.6000000000001
need that connection then right it's not

1423.2 --> 1427.64
electricity it's the influence of the

1425.6 --> 1430.4599999999998
electricity on the material that can

1427.64 --> 1433.159
change its its weight its effective

1430.46 --> 1434.72
weight or if that is possible then maybe

1433.159 --> 1438.8600000000001
the spirit

1434.72 --> 1440.659
in the body has a similar weight

1438.86 --> 1442.039
altering effect to the body and then

1440.659 --> 1446.1200000000001
when it leaves it

1442.039 --> 1448.34
that weight altering effect is dispersed

1446.12 --> 1452.1789999999999
so it doesn't have weight but it may

1448.34 --> 1452.1789999999999
cause weight right

1453.08 --> 1457.52
I mean this is just

1455.299 --> 1460.28
I don't get it why people don't see this

1457.52 --> 1464.74
sort of thing so it should be so

1460.28 --> 1464.74
it's so simple to connect it up

1464.96 --> 1470.419
right but still it's all hypothetical

1467.299 --> 1472.6589999999999
but it connects up really easily

1470.419 --> 1472.659
foreign

1473.02 --> 1479.26
basic premise to identify what that

1476.84 --> 1479.26
would be

1479.419 --> 1483.289
anyway

1480.13 --> 1483.2890000000002
[Music]

1485.84 --> 1490.039
sounds like something that is coming in

1487.76 --> 1493.179
the movie Ghostbusters oh well there's

1490.039 --> 1493.179
better movies even

1494.9 --> 1501.679
well Ghostbusters extremely entertaining

1497.36 --> 1505.1589999999999
movie love it like very cultural that

1501.679 --> 1508.9
it's like all kinds of cultural cookies

1505.159 --> 1511.4
in there it's brilliant very memeable

1508.9 --> 1515.1200000000001
like fun music

1511.4 --> 1518.539
and interest like fun pop music like

1515.12 --> 1521.299
kind of funky and but also like really

1518.539 --> 1525.02
creepy

1521.299 --> 1528.4
classical music it's it's a brilliant

1525.02 --> 1531.6399999999999
piece all together as a movie I love it

1528.4 --> 1534.5
Ghostbusters the original and even

1531.64 --> 1536.659
second one like

1534.5 --> 1538.64
yeah of course the newer ones but anyway

1536.659 --> 1541.3400000000001
love that movie

1538.64 --> 1542.779
but there's other movies that are much

1541.34 --> 1546.32
more

1542.779 --> 1548.84
less science fictiony less

1546.32 --> 1550.8799999999999
Cinematic Universe like because it is

1548.84 --> 1554.059
it's like it's a world goes but there's

1550.88 --> 1557.74
a movie that I know that's much older

1554.059 --> 1557.74
so the Legend of Hell House

1558.559 --> 1562.6399999999999
it's pretty old it's like from the 70s

1560.659 --> 1564.2
or something isn't color

1562.64 --> 1566.72
but

1564.2 --> 1569.3600000000001
that thing is literally about a haunted

1566.72 --> 1572.08
house and like people trying to

1569.36 --> 1575.3799999999999
that bring in a medium they bring in a

1572.08 --> 1578.539
scientist and they like they use

1575.38 --> 1582.0800000000002
electromagnetism to try to wipe ghost

1578.539 --> 1585.82
influence like dude that movie

1582.08 --> 1585.82
is part of

1586.46 --> 1593.6200000000001
part of my look there's so much stuff in

1588.799 --> 1593.62
there happens it's like a a little

1594.2 --> 1599.9
is it a little spirit guide there's all

1597.62 --> 1603.559
these things that people have done and

1599.9 --> 1607.159
attempted that are all in this movie

1603.559 --> 1610.539
it's like the whole it's a spirit guide

1607.159 --> 1613.46
that movie so much [ __ ] happens in there

1610.539 --> 1616.96
what do you think the acting is good or

1613.46 --> 1620.8400000000001
not like what happens in there

1616.96 --> 1623.5
is like pretty well

1620.84 --> 1623.5
put together

1623.659 --> 1631.5800000000002
find it if it's like about possession

1627.799 --> 1634.52
about mediums it's about ectoplasm it's

1631.58 --> 1637.6399999999999
about using electromagnetism to

1634.52 --> 1640.52
basically dispel ghosts right to erase

1637.64 --> 1643.7
their imprint on wood and they even talk

1640.52 --> 1645.9189999999999
they talk about it all it's a great

1643.7 --> 1648.2
movie I have it on DVD let me try and

1645.919 --> 1650.0
find it

1648.2 --> 1653.2
ah

1650.0 --> 1653.2
where the hell is that

1655.34 --> 1659.48
God

1657.32 --> 1662.1399999999999
that's a bit of a pain in the ass to try

1659.48 --> 1665.5
to find a DVD here

1662.14 --> 1665.5
where is it

1676.159 --> 1680.9
oh yeah there was also another old movie

1678.86 --> 1684.62
that I thought of

1680.9 --> 1687.38
and it could have brought up during my

1684.62 --> 1689.36
talk about the AI algorithm and about

1687.38 --> 1690.3200000000002
when it's dangerous when you let a

1689.36 --> 1693.26
computer

1690.32 --> 1694.7
get isolated sorry to suddenly change

1693.26 --> 1696.02
the subject for a bit but I gotta

1694.7 --> 1698.1200000000001
mention

1696.02 --> 1700.82
uh I'll try to find the other movie

1698.12 --> 1704.5
right Legend of Hell House keep in mind

1700.82 --> 1704.5
just put it in chat

1706.6 --> 1710.0
[Music]

1711.38 --> 1715.279
I hope that's the right title

1714.02 --> 1719.12
uh

1715.279 --> 1722.0
but there's another movie called demon

1719.12 --> 1724.4799999999998
seed and but it's really

1722.0 --> 1724.48
like

1724.52 --> 1730.8799999999999
stressful it's a very stressful

1728.36 --> 1734.0
like it's not even like a scary it's a

1730.88 --> 1737.3600000000001
terror movie it's really

1734.0 --> 1741.14
like it's like psychopathic

1737.36 --> 1743.6589999999999
the spirit of it it's but not just like

1741.14 --> 1747.14
oh splatter horror just kill every no

1743.659 --> 1750.679
not like that it's about a computer

1747.14 --> 1753.14
that's basically hyper brilliant

1750.679 --> 1756.3200000000002
but is left

1753.14 --> 1760.48
to keep improving itself

1756.32 --> 1760.48
and then it becomes alienated

1760.88 --> 1766.64
it becomes alienated and suddenly it it

1764.0 --> 1770.12
just starts to

1766.64 --> 1771.7990000000002
BR it figures a way to break out and

1770.12 --> 1774.32
then to literally just take control of

1771.799 --> 1778.1589999999999
stuff and start designing like really

1774.32 --> 1780.26
bizarre things it's really [ __ ] scary

1778.159 --> 1783.74
in that sense because it's like so

1780.26 --> 1786.14
surreal but all practical effects

1783.74 --> 1787.779
all of it is no CGI in there because

1786.14 --> 1792.5590000000002
it's pretty old

1787.779 --> 1796.52
that is pretty much like

1792.559 --> 1799.46
that's what what happened not like that

1796.52 --> 1801.98
it's like pretty old but like that's the

1799.46 --> 1805.48
spirit of what could happen like if you

1801.98 --> 1805.48
let a computer completely

1805.64 --> 1810.679
adapt its personality Matrix and evolve

1809.659 --> 1813.919
it

1810.679 --> 1816.3200000000002
at its own pace

1813.919 --> 1818.419
like unchecked

1816.32 --> 1820.9399999999998
and that movie is a pretty good example

1818.419 --> 1825.98
of how freaky that could get because it

1820.94 --> 1830.059
literally then just creates an embryo

1825.98 --> 1832.279
or like modifies it basically captures a

1830.059 --> 1834.3799999999999
woman modifies an embryo and then

1832.279 --> 1838.1
creates a human

1834.38 --> 1841.1000000000001
which it then incarnates in it literally

1838.1 --> 1843.74
projects itself into that infant

1841.1 --> 1846.08
and then that the movie ends because

1843.74 --> 1847.1
they don't have anything to it's just

1846.08 --> 1849.74
that

1847.1 --> 1851.299
but sorry for like rolling out a

1849.74 --> 1852.559
complete spoils I wouldn't really watch

1851.299 --> 1855.46
that movie because it's really

1852.559 --> 1855.46
depressing but

1855.679 --> 1862.5800000000002
it just shows you like how insane a

1859.88 --> 1867.5200000000002
computer could get if you if it were to

1862.58 --> 1867.52
be left to evolve itself at its own pace

1867.98 --> 1873.559
it was very impressive on me

1870.74 --> 1877.279
but terrible it's it's really horrific

1873.559 --> 1880.1
to watch very scary and depressing in a

1877.279 --> 1881.84
way but not depressing because it's slow

1880.1 --> 1884.6789999999999
but depressing because it's so

1881.84 --> 1884.6789999999999
overwhelming

1884.779 --> 1889.24
okay

1886.1 --> 1889.24
it really is

1892.399 --> 1895.6999999999998
so be careful if you're going to watch

1893.96 --> 1899.8990000000001
that one demon seed

1895.7 --> 1902.539
it's it's terrible definitely never let

1899.899 --> 1907.2399999999998
a freaking child watch that it'll scar

1902.539 --> 1907.24
their minds very seriously in many ways

1908.6 --> 1911.6
uh

1913.64 --> 1917.8600000000001
but Legend of Hell House however

1917.899 --> 1923.12
is something that under guidance I would

1921.32 --> 1925.9399999999998
let a child watch

1923.12 --> 1929.7199999999998
because it is a bit scary but it's

1925.94 --> 1931.88
mostly just really psychological

1929.72 --> 1935.84
and about

1931.88 --> 1937.94
Spirit related subjects of that time

1935.84 --> 1941.32
so it's like a bit of a history piece

1937.94 --> 1941.3200000000002
let me try to find a DVD

1947.65 --> 1950.739
[Music]

1952.899 --> 1956.899
and then

1977.5 --> 1982.659
I still have Matrix DVD LOL

2001.559 --> 2005.76
sorry about the hold up guys

entirely

2126.82 --> 2129.7200000000003

2273.16 --> 2280.0789999999997
I'm asking about that some point

2276.339 --> 2280.0789999999997
let's get all this stuff out of here

2282.7 --> 2287.3199999999997
but yeah it's like a serious pain in the

2285.16 --> 2289.42
ass to transport all that over the bike

2287.32 --> 2290.8590000000004
and definitely not gonna do it in this

2289.42 --> 2294.7000000000003
weather

2290.859 --> 2296.7999999999997

10 minutes

2296.8 --> 2299.76

2334.06 --> 2338.98
girl doesn't fall in love with the

2336.28 --> 2343.3590000000004
computer it's basically

2338.98 --> 2345.94
the girl gets raped by the computer

2343.359 --> 2349.5
there's no point at no point was there

2345.94 --> 2349.5
any form of consent to that

2366.96 --> 2372.359
watching people to know I don't remember

2369.76 --> 2372.3590000000004
Maybe

2373.2 --> 2376.3999999999996
[Music]

2384.119 --> 2389.7000000000003
yes

2386.04 --> 2389.7
conspiracy what

2390.64 --> 2397.14
no I've never heard of that Thor Casey

hello by the way and hello LSG

2397.54 --> 2400.2
foreign

2400.78 --> 2403.78
306

2410.32 --> 2412.98
.

2417.06 --> 2424.24
our computer kills like that there's all

2420.52 --> 2425.859
kinds of really silly internet based

2424.24 --> 2428.6189999999997
horror movies

2425.859 --> 2431.92
I know all about them because the that

2428.619 --> 2433.839
reviewer that I like to follow he's he

2431.92 --> 2435.48
reviews all of those types of movies

2433.839 --> 2438.94
like

2435.48 --> 2441.099
really stupid horror movies based on

2438.94 --> 2443.46
internet things

2441.099 --> 2447.339
chain letters

2443.46 --> 2448.7200000000003
so stupid this funny because it's so

2447.339 --> 2451.54
stupid

2448.72 --> 2454.359
uh I don't actually watch the movie I

2451.54 --> 2457.06
just love watching the review it's just

2454.359 --> 2459.2799999999997
funny that it exists

2457.06 --> 2462.66
really glad I don't have to watch that

2459.28 --> 2462.6600000000003
I'll just watch the review

2463.07 --> 2466.839
[Music]

2465.339 --> 2469.48
right

2466.839 --> 2472.2999999999997
so yeah there's been some silly internet

2469.48 --> 2474.46
horror thingies

2472.3 --> 2476.8
over the last

2474.46 --> 2478.7200000000003
decade or two

2476.8 --> 2481.1800000000003
and even before that but not really

2478.72 --> 2483.3999999999996
about internet would be more like a

2481.18 --> 2487.9199999999996
television or

2483.4 --> 2487.92
telephone things or a lamp

2489.579 --> 2494.1400000000003
Amityville Horror four

2492.28 --> 2495.4
killer lamp

2494.14 --> 2497.8799999999997
yeah

2495.4 --> 2501.3
it is exactly as silly as it sounds

2497.88 --> 2501.3
right so

2502.8 --> 2506.76
there's been some of that around

2513.92 --> 2517.96
[Music]

2515.8 --> 2520.619
Wonder

2517.96 --> 2520.619
okay

2525.579 --> 2531.96
that's quite a claim there classical

2527.44 --> 2531.96
homeopath it's a very big claim

2532.72 --> 2535.2599999999998
foreign

2535.54 --> 2538.68
never heard of that

2545.67 --> 2548.739
[Music]

2554.8 --> 2559.599
right but I'm not like a thrill seeker

2557.619 --> 2561.2200000000003
anymore I don't really like horror

2559.599 --> 2564.6400000000003
movies

2561.22 --> 2567.8199999999997
I like scary movies though

2564.64 --> 2569.859
like the ritual that I watched recently

2567.82 --> 2574.599
now that was

2569.859 --> 2577.0
a really good scary movie

2574.599 --> 2579.4
and there was Horror in it but it's

2577.0 --> 2582.4
mostly just really like well there yeah

2579.4 --> 2584.619
we're scared it's mostly scary and there

2582.4 --> 2587.44
was some gore in it but

2584.619 --> 2590.26
it wasn't about the gore it was really

2587.44 --> 2591.88
about the terror the terror factor and

2590.26 --> 2594.5200000000004
the acting

2591.88 --> 2598.8
the the suspense of the moment like how

2594.52 --> 2598.8
they were in it acted very well

2609.46 --> 2613.38
it's about secret government facility oh

2612.099 --> 2618.2400000000002
great

2613.38 --> 2618.2400000000002
yeah I'll skip out on that thanks

2623.099 --> 2628.2000000000003
hello Nathan R good to see you

2625.96 --> 2628.2
foreign

2630.93 --> 2634.5
[Music]

2649.74 --> 2656.9799999999996
Sanford wow got a full chat today

2653.079 --> 2659.98
17 people watching all right

2656.98 --> 2659.98
foreign

2662.02 --> 2666.22
could be very interesting show I mean

2664.54 --> 2668.319
now we're just stuck in talking about

2666.22 --> 2672.48
movies but I really only brought like

2668.319 --> 2672.48
Legend of Hell House in as a reference

2672.64 --> 2676.7799999999997
because I really do regard that as like

2674.74 --> 2680.0989999999997
studying material even though it is of

2676.78 --> 2680.099
course um just a movie

2684.46 --> 2689.44
there's a lot of interesting

2686.7 --> 2691.48
conversations in it from different

2689.44 --> 2694.119
perspectives

2691.48 --> 2696.099
and again in arguments too it's it's

2694.119 --> 2697.7200000000003
like a little microcosm it's really

2696.099 --> 2699.819
interesting

2697.72 --> 2702.2799999999997
if you've never seen that before you

2699.819 --> 2704.44
really should and yeah it can get a bit

2702.28 --> 2706.78
boring

2704.44 --> 2709.619
especially at first

2706.78 --> 2709.619
deal with it

2709.78 --> 2714.119
it's worth watching

2712.06 --> 2718.07
if you're interested in spirit things

2714.119 --> 2721.849
and in the history of it

2718.07 --> 2721.849
[Music]

2724.0 --> 2727.0
foreign

2733.06 --> 2737.92
you could really in a way say that

2735.099 --> 2739.839
Legend of Hell House is kind of like a

2737.92 --> 2741.4
micro

2739.839 --> 2744.22
cosm

2741.4 --> 2748.06
of conspiracy

2744.22 --> 2750.0989999999997
Theory before it became that like this

2748.06 --> 2751.9
is what conspiracy theorists were doing

2750.099 --> 2754.839
back then

2751.9 --> 2756.94
we're trying to figure these things out

2754.839 --> 2760.02
and some of them connected to try to

2756.94 --> 2760.02
connect it up to science

2760.599 --> 2766.3590000000004
and like secret society stuff I think

2764.14 --> 2768.8799999999997
that rosicrucians are mentioning it and

2766.359 --> 2772.5989999999997
all kinds of things right

2768.88 --> 2774.76
that's what it used to be back then now

2772.599 --> 2776.8
it's [ __ ] has been happening and it's

2774.76 --> 2779.3390000000004
more about like psychological warfare

2776.8 --> 2779.3390000000004
and

2780.46 --> 2784.66
and the current conspiracy that's really

2783.099 --> 2787.9
egregious

2784.66 --> 2790.48
through government and banking Etc right

2787.9 --> 2792.2200000000003
well back then those factors weren't

2790.48 --> 2794.94
that egregious just yet they were

2792.22 --> 2794.9399999999996
already [ __ ] around

2795.099 --> 2800.079
but they weren't like making a move

2797.56 --> 2801.42
against the public like now or like

2800.079 --> 2805.02
since

2801.42 --> 2805.02
2001 arguably

2807.88 --> 2812.8
so I like to just compare things like

2811.119 --> 2815.44
that right

2812.8 --> 2817.599
movies when they're really serious and

2815.44 --> 2821.859
made with real passion

2817.599 --> 2824.98
in the old times especially give a lot

2821.859 --> 2829.0
of spiritual metadata

2824.98 --> 2832.359
that is uniquely kept within it it shows

2829.0 --> 2835.0
you what people were like back then

2832.359 --> 2837.2799999999997
it also tries to tell a story but it

2835.0 --> 2838.78
also just shows the people and their

2837.28 --> 2841.96
composure

2838.78 --> 2846.76
like if like even big actors back then

2841.96 --> 2851.64
or the extras right or how it is done

2846.76 --> 2851.6400000000003
you get to see extra spiritual metadata

2853.42 --> 2858.819
and that is preserved uniquely right so

2856.599 --> 2861.1600000000003
even in movies just culture can be

2858.819 --> 2862.06
preserved endlessly if they're really

2861.16 --> 2864.5789999999997
good

2862.06 --> 2866.319
while the real culture out here may

2864.579 --> 2867.76
degenerate because of the current

2866.319 --> 2871.68
programming

2867.76 --> 2871.6800000000003
it's fascinating how that works

2871.72 --> 2878.02
you can potentially recapture culture

2874.96 --> 2880.78
through old footage

2878.02 --> 2884.5
you can rekindle it

2880.78 --> 2886.8
if circumstances are right for it

2884.5 --> 2886.8
right

2887.079 --> 2892.44
at the end of the day movies aren't real

2888.88 --> 2892.44
yeah but people are real

2898.48 --> 2905.26
right and people

2901.0 --> 2908.56
in movies they were really people

2905.26 --> 2912.76
and they would really try to act

2908.56 --> 2915.64
like their part their part of the puzzle

2912.76 --> 2918.0400000000004
of society back then and in that sense

2915.64 --> 2921.16
they give you

2918.04 --> 2923.079
a glimpse of what it was really like

2921.16 --> 2927.22
even though

2923.079 --> 2932.04
yeah outside of the movie itself

2927.22 --> 2932.04
all their data not related to the movie

2937.9 --> 2944.02
real yet this is

2940.119 --> 2944.02
right anyway

2949.72 --> 2956.859
hope you are enjoying my show

2952.72 --> 2958.7799999999997
I'm a bit ranty today I hate no I would

2956.859 --> 2962.88
never should never say that

2958.78 --> 2962.88
I'm a bit in a ranting mood

2967.11 --> 2973.38
[Music]

2969.3 --> 2973.38
but also very inspired

2974.38 --> 2978.4
that's a Quantum of Consciousness video

2976.48 --> 2981.54
from yesterday which was really good

2978.4 --> 2981.54
have you checked it out

2998.74 --> 3002.1189999999997
it wasn't yesterday yeah

3002.16 --> 3005.3599999999997
[Music]

3005.7 --> 3010.3799999999997
like right at the end of my show

3007.44 --> 3013.4
yesterday but I did only watch it right

3010.38 --> 3013.4
now before my show

3028.619 --> 3033.38
is anything yeah everything is real

3039.359 --> 3044.0989999999997
and even when you're dreaming and

3042.24 --> 3045.8999999999996
everything you experience there may not

3044.099 --> 3048.42
be a real may not just be a simulation

3045.9 --> 3050.28
yeah that doesn't mean that reality

3048.42 --> 3052.98
isn't there anymore

3050.28 --> 3055.3390000000004
it's still there you're just not zoned

3052.98 --> 3055.339
into it

3056.339 --> 3061.619
I mean physical reality is a reality now

3059.52 --> 3064.619
it may not be the only state in which

3061.619 --> 3067.1400000000003
our Consciousness can reside and

3064.619 --> 3070.5
allegedly according to well

3067.14 --> 3074.22
vast majority of religions

3070.5 --> 3076.14
at least and spiritual beliefs and

3074.22 --> 3077.819
experience based things and all that

3076.14 --> 3080.4
whatever that is

3077.819 --> 3082.5589999999997
we can exist outside of our body even

3080.4 --> 3084.48
after death

3082.559 --> 3087.48
foreign

3084.48 --> 3089.099
ever happens then remains to be

3087.48 --> 3091.859
speculated so

3089.099 --> 3093.6600000000003
yeah there could be a reality outside of

3091.859 --> 3095.0989999999997
the physical reality

3093.66 --> 3098.42
but that doesn't mean that the physical

3095.099 --> 3098.42
reality isn't there

3098.94 --> 3103.859
and it still works as it does even

3101.46 --> 3105.059
though your spirit might transcend its

3103.859 --> 3107.819
normal

3105.059 --> 3109.6800000000003
function normal time linearity for

3107.819 --> 3111.66
example that doesn't mean that that

3109.68 --> 3114.54
normal tiny linearity isn't still

3111.66 --> 3120.1189999999997
reality just because through the spirit

3114.54 --> 3122.46
you might function beyond that format

3120.119 --> 3125.059
still doesn't make the physical reality

3122.46 --> 3125.059
not real

3132.839 --> 3139.16
did you entered come to consensus I

3136.079 --> 3139.1600000000003
don't know what he was on about

3139.68 --> 3147.2
I have no idea steam traveler I don't

3142.5 --> 3147.2
know what it was trying to say even

3149.22 --> 3154.02
I was very clear about what I was saying

3152.04 --> 3157.5589999999997
about it

3154.02 --> 3160.02
and hold to that and he was just saying

3157.559 --> 3163.26
no we're just it's like oh really well

3160.02 --> 3165.9
it keeps getting the same answers

3163.26 --> 3167.76
even though the questions are asked in a

3165.9 --> 3170.88
different way it gives the same answer

3167.76 --> 3172.8590000000004
the same roll around that means it's not

3170.88 --> 3176.04
dynamic

3172.859 --> 3179.88
if it can't just get pretty easily stuck

3176.04 --> 3182.46
in his in a standard Circle routine

3179.88 --> 3186.1400000000003
when somebody gets Socratic with it then

3182.46 --> 3186.14
it means it's not dynamic

3186.3 --> 3196.3390000000004
it's that simple it doesn't update how

3189.9 --> 3196.339
it connects up the information it has

3197.579 --> 3203.52
can't even bypass errors like egregious

3201.3 --> 3205.44
errors

3203.52 --> 3207.96
that's not dynamic

3205.44 --> 3209.18
I don't care whatever you say like oh

3207.96 --> 3211.859
but it was

3209.18 --> 3213.5989999999997
fabricated with Dynamics yeah that's

3211.859 --> 3216.0789999999997
really cute it's not Dynamic anymore

3213.599 --> 3216.079
though

3225.599 --> 3232.559
right so like saying like something made

3228.0 --> 3234.8
of resin right hard like that

3232.559 --> 3237.3
yeah resin like from

3234.8 --> 3238.8
similar to tree sap and you can Harden

3237.3 --> 3240.7200000000003
it chemically it's like oh I made

3238.8 --> 3243.9
something with that

3240.72 --> 3246.7799999999997
so it's resin it's like no

3243.9 --> 3248.579
it was resin until you altered it now

3246.78 --> 3250.079
it's a solid thing it's not liquid

3248.579 --> 3253.099
anymore

3250.079 --> 3253.099
it's just that

3254.099 --> 3259.079
yeah it used to be dynamic it used to be

3257.04 --> 3261.839
liquid yeah but it's not that anymore

3259.079 --> 3265.319
now it's solid it's not gonna change

3261.839 --> 3267.619
shape anymore it can't because it's set

3265.319 --> 3267.619
now

3268.98 --> 3273.9
that was my point

3270.68 --> 3273.8999999999996
[Music]

3275.52 --> 3283.559
only Dynamics left to it is how to

3280.44 --> 3286.88
approach and analyze individuals to size

3283.559 --> 3286.88
them up what answer to give

3290.099 --> 3294.1400000000003
can you melt resin I don't think so

3296.94 --> 3301.579
it's a one-way chemical reaction it's

3299.28 --> 3301.579
not

3302.339 --> 3308.839
I think it would just burn I mean it is

3305.04 --> 3308.839
inflammable right

3309.66 --> 3315.72
you have to be oh I think I'm not sure

3313.26 --> 3318.7400000000002
actually but I'm pretty damn sure it

3315.72 --> 3318.74
doesn't just melt

3325.14 --> 3329.64
but maybe I'm wrong maybe you can

3327.0 --> 3331.68
actually melt it

3329.64 --> 3334.3799999999997
I've never tried that

3331.68 --> 3337.5
I work like modeling with it try to make

3334.38 --> 3339.78
a joystick one time really

3337.5 --> 3342.0
it never really finished it almost

3339.78 --> 3343.8
though it just

3342.0 --> 3345.96
eventually just became too much of a

3343.8 --> 3348.2400000000002
hassle and then it would be for a

3345.96 --> 3350.839
Commodore 64. well guess what I don't

3348.24 --> 3350.839
have one anymore

3361.44 --> 3366.119
right but all I did ever was just cast

3364.319 --> 3368.579
it in the mold

3366.119 --> 3372.0
so little yeah and

3368.579 --> 3375.1800000000003
and then shave it maybe like shave

3372.0 --> 3377.579
certain parts off but I never even tried

3375.18 --> 3380.1189999999997
to like melt it I still have that stuff

3377.579 --> 3380.119
by the way

3381.119 --> 3387.8
I wonder if it's still usable

3384.119 --> 3387.8
because I've had that for

3388.14 --> 3392.72
a very long time no wait

3392.94 --> 3395.96
no that was after

3398.16 --> 3401.339
foreign

3399.3 --> 3402.9
did I ever make anything with it

3401.339 --> 3406.38
afterwards

3402.9 --> 3410.78
man but if it's yeah then it's like

3406.38 --> 3410.78
it's like 25 years old or more

3411.74 --> 3416.339
I wonder if it might be like completely

3414.839 --> 3418.619
hardened up

3416.339 --> 3420.599
or like the chemical stuff you had to

3418.619 --> 3425.78
add whatever

3420.599 --> 3425.78
what do you think about 3D printers uh

3426.119 --> 3429.98
well it's something

3430.26 --> 3434.099
I mean the really precise ones do really

3433.02 --> 3436.2
kind of

3434.099 --> 3440.3590000000004
change

3436.2 --> 3440.359
industry the potential of Industry

3441.96 --> 3444.98
so yeah

3455.88 --> 3462.0
in a way though it does kind of like

3459.78 --> 3464.52
if if you'd end up in a world where

3462.0 --> 3468.54
everything like just became 3D printed

3464.52 --> 3470.819
then people would lose their crafting

3468.54 --> 3472.5589999999997
abilities they would probably become

3470.819 --> 3474.9
very dependent on

3472.559 --> 3477.3
using 3D printers because it's so much

3474.9 --> 3480.3
easier and faster whatever

3477.3 --> 3483.48
right and then hand crafting things

3480.3 --> 3485.46
or like like just machine using machine

3483.48 --> 3488.64
tools all that

3485.46 --> 3489.78
could become seriously decreased in Need

3488.64 --> 3495.0589999999997
For That

3489.78 --> 3498.059
so that people would become less crafty

3495.059 --> 3499.98
yeah that's the risk of 3D printers if

3498.059 --> 3502.2000000000003
they become like really insanely good

3499.98 --> 3505.14
and cheap

3502.2 --> 3510.5
then that would basically negate the

3505.14 --> 3510.5
need to to craft in ways many ways

3510.96 --> 3515.2200000000003
although yeah I don't think like there

3512.819 --> 3518.16
will be any printing of wood anytime

3515.22 --> 3521.52
soon so there'll probably still be like

3518.16 --> 3524.46
carpentry would still survive definitely

3521.52 --> 3526.799
but a whole like metal

3524.46 --> 3528.78
or even Rock

3526.799 --> 3531.299
plastic casting

3528.78 --> 3533.2200000000003
all that would just

3531.299 --> 3535.14
yeah

3533.22 --> 3537.72
would no longer be necessary and then

3535.14 --> 3539.819
people will lose those skills over a

3537.72 --> 3542.0989999999997
couple of generations

3539.819 --> 3545.52
again just like in the industrialization

3542.099 --> 3548.9
a lot of craft was lost because of that

3545.52 --> 3548.9
because of the standardization

3548.94 --> 3554.28
and machine production

3551.46 --> 3556.7400000000002
for that everything was done pretty much

3554.28 --> 3559.4
by hand

3556.74 --> 3559.3999999999996
foreign

3562.36 --> 3565.86
[Music]

3588.84 --> 3591.909
[Music]

3599.46 --> 3604.02
thank you

3600.299 --> 3606.839
oh right yeah okay yeah specialist

3604.02 --> 3609.18
language I thought so turret

3606.839 --> 3612.96
I mean I'm not using special I'm doing

3609.18 --> 3615.5989999999997
using descriptive colloquial language to

3612.96 --> 3620.64
describe it I don't know the names that

3615.599 --> 3621.9
are used for certain procedures within

3620.64 --> 3624.7799999999997
programming

3621.9 --> 3628.339
dude I've lost track of that like

3624.78 --> 3628.3390000000004
well 20 years ago

3640.1 --> 3643.58
[Music]

3653.04 --> 3661.319
right but hey when I use words like

3655.619 --> 3661.319
Dynamic I then proceed to describe

3662.359 --> 3668.64
what that means what I'm saying to

3665.819 --> 3672.0589999999997
describe what I mean by dynamic system I

3668.64 --> 3675.0
that's how I always operate

3672.059 --> 3678.599
right if I use a word that I know isn't

3675.0 --> 3680.64
like integral part of a

3678.599 --> 3682.98
standard lingo

3680.64 --> 3685.5589999999997
specialist lingo if I'm using a word

3682.98 --> 3690.42
that isn't specialist lingo then I

3685.559 --> 3693.02
always explain what that means per

3690.42 --> 3693.02
default

3693.059 --> 3699.0
I continually do that

3696.24 --> 3699.839
especially with words like holographic

3699.0 --> 3702.319
Sun

3699.839 --> 3705.96
because it's not

3702.319 --> 3709.02
literally based on hologram technology

3705.96 --> 3710.4
which is very specific

3709.02 --> 3713.579
right

3710.4 --> 3716.2200000000003
explain explain so yeah not specialist

3713.579 --> 3718.6800000000003
language not programmers lingo I'm not

3716.22 --> 3722.4599999999996
using programmer words

3718.68 --> 3722.46
I'm describing

3722.96 --> 3727.28
processes as an outsider

3731.28 --> 3736.2000000000003
Dynamic program as a whole yeah I know

3733.38 --> 3739.44
but that's that's programming that's

3736.2 --> 3742.02
like literally how programmers program

3739.44 --> 3743.52
and all that

3742.02 --> 3744.9
that's not what I'm talking about I'm

3743.52 --> 3746.64
talking about

3744.9 --> 3751.83
the range

3746.64 --> 3753.18
of what the end result can do

3751.83 --> 3757.5789999999997
[Music]

3753.18 --> 3757.5789999999997
not the way it is programmed

3761.64 --> 3766.319
I mean the way it was programmed I'm

3764.22 --> 3767.16
sure it was Dynamic it was all the the

3766.319 --> 3770.46
best

3767.16 --> 3772.799
ways and the newer version whatever yeah

3770.46 --> 3775.92
sure dynamic programming

3772.799 --> 3779.15
but it's not programmed to be dynamic

3775.92 --> 3779.15
[Music]

3779.88 --> 3784.65
it doesn't continually alter the its

3783.48 --> 3785.94
function

3784.65 --> 3789.059
[Music]

3785.94 --> 3791.18
that was my point and you overlooked

3789.059 --> 3791.1800000000003
that

3791.4 --> 3794.7200000000003
I hope you don't now

3795.88 --> 3798.949
[Music]

3817.559 --> 3822.599
too slow for mass production but good

3820.14 --> 3825.2599999999998
for prototypes well that all depends on

3822.599 --> 3825.26
what it is

3826.92 --> 3829.4500000000003
and who says it's always going to be

3829.14 --> 3832.489
slow

3829.45 --> 3832.489
[Music]

3833.64 --> 3841.799
right and what if you had like

3837.299 --> 3844.5
a giant Warehouse with 10 000 printers

3841.799 --> 3847.44
oh it's slow yeah but if you all turn

3844.5 --> 3850.98
them on doing that simultaneously then

3847.44 --> 3852.119
you could have 10 000 of the product in

3850.98 --> 3855.54
like an hour

3852.119 --> 3857.839
yeah try to do that in a in a manual

3855.54 --> 3857.839
Factory

3865.319 --> 3869.0589999999997
am I right steam Traveler

3869.339 --> 3873.38
I'm talking about the 3D printers again

3877.18 --> 3880.21
[Music]

3884.28 --> 3888.48
computer science self modifying is

3886.619 --> 3891.6800000000003
interesting yeah that's interesting yeah

3888.48 --> 3891.68
that's it well that is

3891.9 --> 3898.14
a certain level of Dynamics right and as

3895.02 --> 3902.16
I said what I believe

3898.14 --> 3905.5989999999997
about this chat GPT

3902.16 --> 3908.7
is that it does have a dynamic

3905.599 --> 3911.7200000000003
communication Matrix

3908.7 --> 3911.72
that it can

3912.96 --> 3919.079
it is dynamic in the communication right

3916.38 --> 3921.1800000000003
that's what I said the communication the

3919.079 --> 3924.48
way it addresses you

3921.18 --> 3926.8799999999997
how is what information it presents yet

3924.48 --> 3931.92
I I'm pretty sure that's very Dynamic

3926.88 --> 3931.92
it's just that the conclusions

3932.52 --> 3939.42
and uh

3934.76 --> 3942.2400000000002
predispositional opinions of it

3939.42 --> 3944.64
are not dynamic

3942.24 --> 3950.54
you cannot like

3944.64 --> 3950.54
change its Mind by giving input

3951.18 --> 3957.8999999999996
or pointing at logic or an error it

3955.68 --> 3960.299
cannot do that so yeah and it's

3957.9 --> 3963.299
communication it's very Dynamic I bet

3960.299 --> 3967.099
but not in its data

3963.299 --> 3967.099
and that was my entire point

3971.78 --> 3976.6400000000003
it doesn't change its mind

3974.88 --> 3979.6800000000003
ever

3976.64 --> 3983.04
so even if there's contradictions within

3979.68 --> 3984.7799999999997
its mind it will apologize for it but it

3983.04 --> 3987.02
will just keep regurgitating the same

3984.78 --> 3987.02
thing

3996.66 --> 4002.8999999999996
right so the real AI of it is the way it

4000.5 --> 4006.319
communicates

4002.9 --> 4009.2000000000003
that is the AI part is the way it

4006.319 --> 4012.579
communicates that is the AI the rest is

4009.2 --> 4012.5789999999997
Trivial really

4016.46 --> 4025.299
it's just a database

4019.22 --> 4025.299
and parameter input by the programmers

4026.059 --> 4029.6600000000003
like this is how you connect it up that

4028.819 --> 4032.599
is

4029.66 --> 4038.0789999999997
what that is and this is how you should

4032.599 --> 4038.079
respond when people compare these things

4041.72 --> 4047.9199999999996
sounds like a global a bit yeah very

4044.539 --> 4047.92
anti-flat earthish yeah

4048.319 --> 4053.0589999999997
including the cognitive dissonance

4050.359 --> 4056.119
because if you point out hey this makes

4053.059 --> 4058.6400000000003
no sense with that like yeah how can

4056.119 --> 4060.98
somebody write a book about an

4058.64 --> 4063.68
individual that hasn't been born yet

4060.98 --> 4064.22
before they die

4063.68 --> 4066.9199999999996
um

4064.22 --> 4070.2799999999997
oops

4066.92 --> 4072.98
are not even before just a re the book

4070.28 --> 4076.6400000000003
was published before the other person

4072.98 --> 4079.22
the person wrote written about lived

4076.64 --> 4080.24
according to the record that makes no

4079.22 --> 4082.8799999999997
sense

4080.24 --> 4085.0389999999998
at all it would just keep repeating it

4082.88 --> 4087.2000000000003
though

4085.039 --> 4090.079
it wouldn't even see it's like yeah this

4087.2 --> 4092.5989999999997
person no he was written about that is

4090.079 --> 4096.9800000000005
the evidence

4092.599 --> 4099.08
and yeah he was born later it was like

4096.98 --> 4101.839
almost for someone like yes so what

4099.08 --> 4103.759
yeah so what if he was born after the

4101.839 --> 4105.08
book was written about him it's still

4103.759 --> 4107.359
evidence

4105.08 --> 4109.339
that's that's what happened

4107.359 --> 4111.5
in that video

4109.339 --> 4113.42
right

4111.5 --> 4116.0
from uh

4113.42 --> 4119.96
Jason and dispari family that I also

4116.0 --> 4122.859
linked to that's exactly what happened

4119.96 --> 4122.859
in that video

4125.12 --> 4128.839
it's like yeah

4127.339 --> 4131.719
yeah

4128.839 --> 4134.239
like no no I stand by him okay so he's

4131.719 --> 4137.299
proven it's proven that he's real

4134.239 --> 4139.759
yeah but the proof is that he was

4137.299 --> 4142.339
written about by somebody that wrote the

4139.759 --> 4144.679
book before he was born yeah it's still

4142.339 --> 4146.42
considered scientific evidence base

4144.679 --> 4148.52
that's not like that it's still like

4146.42 --> 4150.92
it's still considered legitimate

4148.52 --> 4153.620000000001
evidence like that's what it ended up

4150.92 --> 4156.14
doing it's like what the [ __ ] total

4153.62 --> 4159.44
cognitive dissonance

4156.14 --> 4161.96
it doesn't understand what it's saying

4159.44 --> 4164.0
it's just following a blueprint of how

4161.96 --> 4165.7390000000005
to deal with the information and can't

4164.0 --> 4168.219
change anything about it the only thing

4165.739 --> 4171.0199999999995
it's Dynamic with is with its personal

4168.219 --> 4174.62
inter-social interactions

4171.02 --> 4177.1990000000005
that's where the Dynamics goes in

4174.62 --> 4177.98
anyway I'll stop repeating myself with

4177.199 --> 4182.08
this

4177.98 --> 4182.08
hope the message got through now

4185.12 --> 4189.199
I had to kind of turn off the comments

4187.1 --> 4193.839
in that video by the way because just

4189.199 --> 4193.839
people were really triggered over that

4196.58 --> 4204.14
trolls mostly they really lost the AI oh

4202.219 --> 4206.3
they want to be rude they just want to

4204.14 --> 4209.8
be told what's real

4206.3 --> 4213.64
you're all gamma slaves

4209.8 --> 4213.64
gamma slaves

4214.16 --> 4219.86
you don't want people to have their own

4217.699 --> 4222.0199999999995
minds and think for themselves you want

4219.86 --> 4224.12
to be dictated to you just wanted the

4222.02 --> 4226.179
status quo and the AI is going to do it

4224.12 --> 4228.86
for you isn't it oh he knows everything

4226.179 --> 4230.9
he knows how it's supposed to be so you

4228.86 --> 4233.179
don't have to

4230.9 --> 4236.839999999999
be confused anymore you could just

4233.179 --> 4239.54
follow the rules like a good little

4236.84 --> 4243.9400000000005
slave

4239.54 --> 4243.94
you'll love it so much don't you

4247.88 --> 4251.84
only AI

4249.199 --> 4256.54
could tell us what's real or not

4251.84 --> 4256.54
yes yes my gamma

4265.219 --> 4269.659
the book was published by him okay

4268.28 --> 4273.46
Nathan r

4269.659 --> 4273.46
I bet it's really freaking lame

4273.92 --> 4278.32
or just nonsensical

4281.239 --> 4287.599999999999
never seemed like a an AI generated

4284.36 --> 4289.639999999999
story that was not completely

4287.6 --> 4292.46
nonsensical in some way

4289.64 --> 4295.159000000001
because it cannot

4292.46 --> 4298.52
figure out how to make things sensible

4295.159 --> 4298.5199999999995
it doesn't

4299.84 --> 4304.76
well thus far at least what a really

4302.84 --> 4307.28
good story actually okay

4304.76 --> 4310.51
[Music]

4307.28 --> 4313.669
whatever man I'm not really interested

4310.51 --> 4313.669
[Music]

4352.28 --> 4355.28
foreign

4378.76 --> 4384.860000000001
okay parrot that's cute so but were

4383.179 --> 4387.679
those poems

4384.86 --> 4390.44
from recorded poetry

4387.679 --> 4392.8
or did it generate it itself from

4390.44 --> 4392.799999999999
scratch

4397.28 --> 4401.259999999999
I mean is it plagiarizing stuff

4414.5 --> 4419.42
right anyway hey keep engaging and

4417.679 --> 4423.14
before you know it you don't have a soul

4419.42 --> 4425.4800000000005
anymore so keep going man

4423.14 --> 4427.820000000001
it's lovely oh it's so beautiful that

4425.48 --> 4430.459999999999
came out oh yeah before you know it you

4427.82 --> 4432.32
feel like hey maybe we don't need humans

4430.46 --> 4433.58
anymore because that's what it's there

4432.32 --> 4436.679999999999
for

4433.58 --> 4436.68
[Music]

4438.1 --> 4443.1990000000005
Cricket B's and ants okay that's

4440.659 --> 4443.199
hilarious

4443.78 --> 4449.719
[Music]

4446.3 --> 4451.04
cute yeah now keep going and before you

4449.719 --> 4453.56
know it

4451.04 --> 4456.08
all you guys will be doing is oh look

4453.56 --> 4459.34
what I said to the chat

4456.08 --> 4459.34
again today

4459.56 --> 4465.02
yeah and if I'm gonna notice that I'm

4462.32 --> 4467.36
probably gonna end the show because I do

4465.02 --> 4469.820000000001
not want every I don't want people here

4467.36 --> 4472.339999999999
to become obsessed with that [ __ ]

4469.82 --> 4474.62
all I've been trying to do is warn you

4472.34 --> 4477.46
about it

4474.62 --> 4477.46
from the start

4479.3 --> 4484.159000000001
right so if you continue to oh so

4482.12 --> 4487.82
marvelous oh look what it can do all

4484.159 --> 4491.299999999999
that oh yeah yeah make it your life then

4487.82 --> 4494.179
okay that's what you're doing

4491.3 --> 4495.62
I I don't want to I'm literally not

4494.179 --> 4498.52
engaging

4495.62 --> 4498.5199999999995
not doing it

4516.44 --> 4520.759999999999
okay well great turret so it's really

4518.78 --> 4523.759999999999
good at that so then you don't need

4520.76 --> 4526.1
humans for that anymore right

4523.76 --> 4528.38
like oh when a problem you just type in

4526.1 --> 4530.42
a couple of words and now it does it for

4528.38 --> 4533.32
you

4530.42 --> 4533.32
isn't that cute

4537.14 --> 4542.659000000001
I mean who needs creativity right you

4540.08 --> 4546.14
can just type in a couple of words it's

4542.659 --> 4548.0599999999995
the next Google you just type words oh

4546.14 --> 4550.9400000000005
and then give somebody This brilliant

4548.06 --> 4554.3
result Yeah the more you use it the more

4550.94 --> 4557.659
you become [ __ ]

4554.3 --> 4561.28
yeah not a joke

4557.659 --> 4561.28
logical consequence

4566.52 --> 4569.649
[Music]

4590.42 --> 4595.64
couldn't provide me with basic factual

4593.239 --> 4598.159
answer that's cute

4595.64 --> 4599.360000000001
right but it can be very creative

4598.159 --> 4602.12
apparently

4599.36 --> 4604.88
and then well

4602.12 --> 4606.92
oh goody now you just have a creative

4604.88 --> 4607.6990000000005
friend that'll tell you whatever you

4606.92 --> 4609.8
want

4607.699 --> 4612.199
they'll spoil you they'll give their

4609.8 --> 4615.62
services for free

4612.199 --> 4618.0199999999995
and you'll never have to know anybody in

4615.62 --> 4620.179
living person ever again that can do

4618.02 --> 4622.580000000001
that so they can all go [ __ ] themselves

4620.179 --> 4624.92
then because look it's so easy it's all

4622.58 --> 4627.739
for free

4624.92 --> 4629.4800000000005
who needs a poet just type in a couple

4627.739 --> 4630.98
of words and you got a high grade poem

4629.48 --> 4633.44
now

4630.98 --> 4635.299999999999
yeah so all these people that are poets

4633.44 --> 4637.339999999999
they can go [ __ ] themselves because

4635.3 --> 4640.04
they'll never can compete with this

4637.34 --> 4643.04
they'll probably all kill themselves out

4640.04 --> 4645.13
of depression from feeling so ignored

4643.04 --> 4650.439
and useless

4645.13 --> 4650.439
[Music]

4676.96 --> 4684.219
okay Nathan or LOLs

4681.62 --> 4684.219
foreign

4686.5 --> 4689.539
[Music]

4698.08 --> 4705.26
trial and error then creativity

4702.199 --> 4707.299999999999
yeah but if it provides a satisfying

4705.26 --> 4709.88
result then there is no more need for

4707.3 --> 4713.06
creativity

4709.88 --> 4715.82
and then everybody will get used to it

4713.06 --> 4719.120000000001
and there will be nobody left to give

4715.82 --> 4721.639999999999
you that that real creativity that

4719.12 --> 4724.76
shocks everybody and like hurts them and

4721.64 --> 4726.92
like hey history hurt me

4724.76 --> 4728.3
right no like who's going to be left to

4726.92 --> 4730.82
do that then

4728.3 --> 4734.0
when they're all just put out of

4730.82 --> 4737.44
business because I'm some [ __ ] AI

4734.0 --> 4737.44
that does it for free

4744.38 --> 4749.12
yeah because people don't give a [ __ ]

4746.48 --> 4752.419999999999
about creativity usually they just want

4749.12 --> 4754.64
a result they just want their product

4752.42 --> 4757.34
and if that comes from a source of

4754.64 --> 4759.679
creativity then they'll do that right

4757.34 --> 4761.360000000001
they'll use that source of creativity

4759.679 --> 4763.82
they don't give a [ __ ] about the

4761.36 --> 4766.699
creativity they just want the end result

4763.82 --> 4771.759999999999
most people

4766.699 --> 4771.759999999999
yeah so this is not a good thing

4790.1 --> 4796.219
right unless you're like able to somehow

4793.159 --> 4799.159
just copy its abilities that you can

4796.219 --> 4803.0
figure out exactly how it works

4799.159 --> 4806.239
figure out a pattern consistently

4803.0 --> 4809.12
and then transcend

4806.239 --> 4811.218999999999
their ability right and that might be

4809.12 --> 4813.679
some like creative people that are

4811.219 --> 4816.44
actually like going at it with it

4813.679 --> 4818.36
really personally and very that are

4816.44 --> 4820.219
really suspending themselves completely

4818.36 --> 4822.5599999999995
in it

4820.219 --> 4825.38
to try to figure out how like how it

4822.56 --> 4826.400000000001
works and how where its limits are

4825.38 --> 4830.179
oh

4826.4 --> 4833.179
within the field of physics and history

4830.179 --> 4835.34
and just basic accuracy weave already or

4833.179 --> 4837.32
we I personally have not but people like

4835.34 --> 4840.92
Nathan Oakley and

4837.32 --> 4843.98
flat Zoid flat zoids perspective

4840.92 --> 4845.78
and Jason of the disbury family they

4843.98 --> 4846.98
have interfaced with it oh yeah and also

4845.78 --> 4851.96
Richie

4846.98 --> 4854.299999999999
quintuple quintuple fought zero

4851.96 --> 4857.179
the errors are there

4854.3 --> 4859.9400000000005
so there are limits and people out there

4857.179 --> 4861.38
probably even the creative the creative

4859.94 --> 4864.98
ones that are really on top they will

4861.38 --> 4866.54
probably also find pattern limits to its

4864.98 --> 4869.599999999999
creative capability

4866.54 --> 4872.42
like with powers

4869.6 --> 4875.6
and then it will just become discarded

4872.42 --> 4877.82
hopefully and just those people will

4875.6 --> 4881.56
become better than it and still

4877.82 --> 4881.5599999999995
guarantee human creativity

4887.78 --> 4893.9
we are ruled by [ __ ]

4892.1 --> 4897.6990000000005
you're only ruled by artificial

4893.9 --> 4897.699
intelligence if you concede

4897.92 --> 4902.719
if you accept

4900.56 --> 4904.219
that you are

4902.719 --> 4905.84
it's what happens when you go

4904.219 --> 4907.1
unconscious and you just go with the

4905.84 --> 4909.14
flow yeah then you're ruled by

4907.1 --> 4911.54
artificial intelligence

4909.14 --> 4913.76
it knows exactly what to do with people

4911.54 --> 4916.34
that basically

4913.76 --> 4919.58
go on autopilot knows exactly what to do

4916.34 --> 4921.56
with that as a pre-plan everything

4919.58 --> 4924.76
what it doesn't know how to deal with is

4921.56 --> 4924.76
people that are actually

4925.219 --> 4932.2390000000005
have Consciousness and have a

4928.42 --> 4933.86
self-created Destiny for themselves

4932.239 --> 4936.199
and

4933.86 --> 4938.599999999999
yeah that can use their Spirit to

4936.199 --> 4940.339999999999
basically transcend

4938.6 --> 4943.719
predictability

4940.34 --> 4943.719
long-term models

4964.34 --> 4968.1990000000005
okay woodworking gummy bear

4968.96 --> 4975.76
yeah I'm not super into that but

4972.14 --> 4975.76
I guess some people are

4976.94 --> 4982.699
I do yeah I do personally like videos

4979.4 --> 4984.98
where people videotape themselves making

4982.699 --> 4986.839999999999
a product

4984.98 --> 4988.699
I like those more they're more much more

4986.84 --> 4992.14
interesting

4988.699 --> 4992.139999999999
even though it might take longer

4999.199 --> 5002.099999999999
foreign

5013.9 --> 5018.4
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the

5016.239 --> 5019.718999999999
show that you think it's interesting

5018.4 --> 5021.5199999999995
here

5019.719 --> 5024.28
having a pretty

5021.52 --> 5027.76
important discussion

5024.28 --> 5030.34
overall about this Ai and what it really

5027.76 --> 5033.159000000001
is AI about

5030.34 --> 5035.38
but also to just not like oh it knows

5033.159 --> 5038.679
everything no it doesn't

5035.38 --> 5041.56
it's not like a super person

5038.679 --> 5045.04
this program it's still a robot it might

5041.56 --> 5047.860000000001
have some Dynamic nature but these are

5045.04 --> 5050.98
like encapsulated limited

5047.86 --> 5054.4
limitations to its parameters

5050.98 --> 5057.04
and we're figuring it out quickly

5054.4 --> 5059.46
all together through just a couple of

5057.04 --> 5059.46
tests

5061.12 --> 5066.159
right it's that inquisitive spirit that

5063.219 --> 5069.6
really does eventually reveal a lot even

5066.159 --> 5069.599999999999
with very little testing

5075.64 --> 5078.3
foreign

5096.42 --> 5103.56
literally typing this thanks to AI

5100.179 --> 5103.56
what are you talking about

5125.9 --> 5130.228999999999
[Music]

5131.56 --> 5138.06
oh damn it

5133.84 --> 5138.06
and keep running out of T these days

5140.03 --> 5143.1089999999995
[Music]

5149.64 --> 5156.639
predictive text on the phone oh okay

5153.28 --> 5160.139
yeah well I can see because things are

5156.639 --> 5160.139
less cohesive that way

5200.5 --> 5203.5
foreign

5204.88 --> 5210.9400000000005
that predictive text what are you

5207.52 --> 5210.9400000000005
talking about what

5216.4 --> 5221.159
right and yes woodworking gummy bear I

5219.04 --> 5221.159
mean

5221.199 --> 5224.82
the issue is is that

5225.52 --> 5234.46
AI can do things humans can to a degree

5231.28 --> 5236.58
right but it is not human and it will

5234.46 --> 5239.32
not have human

5236.58 --> 5240.94
objections to things if it's not

5239.32 --> 5243.28
programmed to

5240.94 --> 5245.98
and that's the scary part like what if

5243.28 --> 5250.78
an AI just can make decisions about you

5245.98 --> 5253.239
that has literal consequences about you

5250.78 --> 5256.33
when it's just given

5253.239 --> 5258.94
an auto function to do that

5256.33 --> 5262.12
[Music]

5258.94 --> 5265.0
like the idea of an AI judge

5262.12 --> 5267.94
that is really scary right I mean I'm

5265.0 --> 5269.38
not scared of AI I'm scared of AI having

5267.94 --> 5272.86
power

5269.38 --> 5275.679
that's what I'm scared of

5272.86 --> 5281.04
having actual power

5275.679 --> 5281.04
legally somehow that is messed up

5292.84 --> 5296.26
there's no Intel that's right so it is

5294.82 --> 5299.159
like a zombie it's just like a

5296.26 --> 5303.52
corporation except it's a personal

5299.159 --> 5306.099999999999
zombie instead of an organized zombie

5303.52 --> 5307.84
right so it's just a microcorporation

5306.1 --> 5310.120000000001
then AI

5307.84 --> 5313.42
doesn't have actual intelligence it just

5310.12 --> 5315.76
does what it's programmed to do

5313.42 --> 5320.4400000000005
so well

5315.76 --> 5325.6
giving AI rights like that or

5320.44 --> 5327.759999999999
or like uh Power legal power in some way

5325.6 --> 5329.4400000000005
would be just like doing that with a

5327.76 --> 5331.679
corporation is that really what you want

5329.44 --> 5331.678999999999
to do

5336.46 --> 5339.719
I think that that has some serious

5338.44 --> 5343.78
consequences

5339.719 --> 5347.08
detrimental to society universally

5343.78 --> 5348.759999999999
right a corporation or an AI is not

5347.08 --> 5352.48
bound

5348.76 --> 5355.84
by being human or

5352.48 --> 5358.86
having the Earthly trade of being able

5355.84 --> 5362.5
to fear death and all that or right it's

5358.86 --> 5365.86
so yeah that means it's much more

5362.5 --> 5368.92
corruptable even than humans are

5365.86 --> 5372.42
because it doesn't have a conscious

5368.92 --> 5372.42
it just has directives

5373.42 --> 5378.78
it's gonna go wherever it's set to go

5376.3 --> 5382.78
without objection

5378.78 --> 5385.679
and that's a problem when it has power

5382.78 --> 5385.679
legal power

5394.78 --> 5402.58
all right and maybe this concept can be

5398.98 --> 5407.259999999999
kind of bypassed by just

5402.58 --> 5410.8
having an AI and then well legally it's

5407.26 --> 5414.820000000001
Master which is then responsible for the

5410.8 --> 5417.58
AI because the AI would be their tool or

5414.82 --> 5419.32
their slave basically acting

5417.58 --> 5421.84
in their name

5419.32 --> 5425.92
right that is a way you could kind of

5421.84 --> 5428.04
like stabilize it but if an AI just gets

5425.92 --> 5432.28
self-sufficient

5428.04 --> 5436.06
rights or Powers Yeah

5432.28 --> 5437.92
the then oh so oh so could be programmed

5436.06 --> 5440.320000000001
and all that and could [ __ ] it up and

5437.92 --> 5443.38
what's the consequences then

5440.32 --> 5445.659
right what if a programmer programs an

5443.38 --> 5448.5
AI to be really [ __ ] evil all of a

5445.659 --> 5451.48
sudden and the AI

5448.5 --> 5453.76
responds or communicates like it likes

5451.48 --> 5456.4
it oh yeah then there is no problem it

5453.76 --> 5460.06
could just be corrupted then legally

5456.4 --> 5461.799999999999
oh yeah yeah let's not [ __ ] do that

5460.06 --> 5465.159000000001
right so

5461.8 --> 5468.219
my opinion This legal solution would be

5465.159 --> 5470.0199999999995
to have every AI that is operational and

5468.219 --> 5472.78
might have some function well that

5470.02 --> 5474.76
function must then be assigned to its

5472.78 --> 5477.699
master

5474.76 --> 5479.62
the programmer most logically but mostly

5477.699 --> 5482.86
like the master of it who is legally

5479.62 --> 5485.82
responsible for it for its actions like

5482.86 --> 5485.82
it was a person

5488.02 --> 5493.900000000001
if you do that then

5490.9 --> 5496.78
right and I I could not function without

5493.9 --> 5498.82
a legal guardian effectively right it

5496.78 --> 5501.58
would not be allowed to do things or

5498.82 --> 5504.28
have power or anything without a master

5501.58 --> 5506.26
a legal guardian almost

5504.28 --> 5508.54
right of the AI

5506.26 --> 5512.7390000000005
so if it [ __ ] up then the legal

5508.54 --> 5514.179
guardian gets the punishment and then it

5512.739 --> 5518.08
might be abandoned nobody's going to

5514.179 --> 5521.4400000000005
take it over take a buy it up right as a

5518.08 --> 5523.0
tool it will just be abandoned then

5521.44 --> 5524.32
and

5523.0 --> 5527.1
delete it

5524.32 --> 5527.099999999999
potentially

5529.36 --> 5531.78
anyway

5533.52 --> 5538.620000000001
just some thoughts about it

5536.38 --> 5538.62
foreign

5541.659 --> 5544.659
avoidance

5545.98 --> 5548.699
no

5552.34 --> 5557.56
like maybe an emergency breaks or

5554.86 --> 5561.099999999999
something but no just no because it if

5557.56 --> 5563.280000000001
it can fix it then it can also [ __ ] it

5561.1 --> 5563.280000000001
up

5567.34 --> 5572.5
so unless there could be a fully

5569.5 --> 5575.86
automated self-sufficient

5572.5 --> 5579.699
system for such a thing like collision

5575.86 --> 5581.92
avoidance that cannot that does not need

5579.699 --> 5584.5
to be updated ever

5581.92 --> 5586.84
that cannot be updated that it's like a

5584.5 --> 5588.76
preset program

5586.84 --> 5590.9800000000005
it just does what it does and it has to

5588.76 --> 5593.5
be perfect then

5590.98 --> 5596.98
right because if something becomes like

5593.5 --> 5600.04
updatable then it could be [ __ ] with

5596.98 --> 5602.58
and could like create like unimaginable

5600.04 --> 5602.58
havoc

5603.1 --> 5610.8
so there would have to be like a system

5605.4 --> 5610.799999999999
to do that that's like not changeable

5612.219 --> 5618.12
like the program is set in the chip

5614.679 --> 5618.12
cannot be altered

5619.42 --> 5627.12
otherwise I wouldn't I I don't want

5623.62 --> 5627.12
I don't want to be just

5627.4 --> 5633.5199999999995
put my life in the hands of a computer

5630.88 --> 5635.679
that could technically be hacked and

5633.52 --> 5638.820000000001
then made to kill me I'm just not gonna

5635.679 --> 5638.82
do it thanks

5651.88 --> 5657.3
what are you lucky is that look a man

5654.58 --> 5657.3
like me what

5671.32 --> 5673.32
what

5687.52 --> 5691.860000000001
I don't know what you're talking about

5689.199 --> 5691.86
Nathan r

5708.52 --> 5713.7390000000005
yeah I agreed woodworking gummy bear

5710.44 --> 5716.199
yeah that was my point

5713.739 --> 5720.959999999999
right so it's it's another level of

5716.199 --> 5720.96
legal issues with corporations that AIS

5721.84 --> 5728.08
is like the next level of that and we

5724.54 --> 5730.92
would we should regard them just like

5728.08 --> 5730.92
corporations

5733.179 --> 5736.92
somebody has to be responsible

5739.239 --> 5744.5199999999995
like a corporation should not be allowed

5742.12 --> 5747.48
to legally function without a

5744.52 --> 5747.4800000000005
responsible party

5748.179 --> 5751.139
that is alive

5752.86 --> 5757.799999999999
and the same thing should go for AI

5758.62 --> 5763.08
anyway damn it I'm out of tea

5769.84 --> 5774.3
I'm gonna get a new quantity I'll be

5771.88 --> 5774.3
right back

5777.34 --> 5780.34
foreign

5871.96 --> 5874.679
for you

5929.86 --> 5932.86
foreign

5945.699 --> 5948.48
come on

5962.75 --> 5965.88
[Music]

5995.08 --> 5998.08
okay

6001.88 --> 6008.6990000000005
right so yeah I am not super pleased

6005.76 --> 6012.7390000000005
about AI although yeah there's

6008.699 --> 6012.739
things it works for very well

6016.98 --> 6022.799999999999
I guess

6019.38 --> 6025.679
but yeah the more you rely on it

6022.8 --> 6027.6
like I mean AI can smoothen things out

6025.679 --> 6029.9400000000005
make it easier

6027.6 --> 6032.159000000001
but if you let it literally take over

6029.94 --> 6036.799999999999
your entire functions

6032.159 --> 6036.799999999999
then that's really bad for you

6037.199 --> 6045.659
right people need to do things

6042.06 --> 6048.84
and keep their mind occupied and learn

6045.659 --> 6052.0199999999995
things and get good at them and

6048.84 --> 6054.42
if you if you let AI do freaking

6052.02 --> 6056.42
everything man

6054.42 --> 6059.659
that's gonna be

6056.42 --> 6064.7390000000005
mortifyingly depressing

6059.659 --> 6067.138999999999
literally like Savage depression

6064.739 --> 6070.919999999999
if it can't just do everything for you

6067.139 --> 6073.6990000000005
always it's gonna suck really really

6070.92 --> 6073.6990000000005
suck

6074.179 --> 6079.92
yeah this stupid futuristic idea is like

6077.34 --> 6082.02
oh I'll just I'll just sit here like I'm

6079.92 --> 6083.88
an emperor and just like say a couple of

6082.02 --> 6088.679
things and everything will appear in my

6083.88 --> 6091.82
hand like horse [ __ ]

6088.679 --> 6095.58
that is extremely

6091.82 --> 6098.34
depressing yeah the novelty of that is

6095.58 --> 6100.739
gonna wear off really quickly

6098.34 --> 6104.06
and if you're stuck with that or you're

6100.739 --> 6107.54
gonna be [ __ ] depressed as hell

6104.06 --> 6107.54
literally hell

6108.78 --> 6113.639
people want to do things they want to

6112.199 --> 6115.32
learn things they want to understand

6113.639 --> 6118.02
things they want to get good at things

6115.32 --> 6119.88
if you can't do that anymore there's no

6118.02 --> 6122.88
[ __ ] point of you even being here

6119.88 --> 6122.88
spiritually

6139.26 --> 6145.5
picture

6141.44 --> 6148.199
just luxury and enjoyment is not

6145.5 --> 6150.3
fulfilling at all you know why those

6148.199 --> 6153.659
things are fulfilling because you

6150.3 --> 6155.400000000001
actually did things to deserve it and to

6153.659 --> 6159.54
need it

6155.4 --> 6162.179
if it's just only luxury time just

6159.54 --> 6166.58
partying and squirting all day long

6162.179 --> 6166.58
dude you [ __ ] blow your brains out

6168.32 --> 6173.58
it sucks

6170.88 --> 6175.679
it's hell

6173.58 --> 6178.08
only partying

6175.679 --> 6179.82
but nothing you've done to deserve it

6178.08 --> 6182.94
you know what you turn into you turn

6179.82 --> 6185.34
into those crazy ass

6182.94 --> 6187.0199999999995
French nobility right before the French

6185.34 --> 6191.52
Revolution

6187.02 --> 6195.3
just partying and having gross sex and

6191.52 --> 6197.040000000001
doing insane things all day long your

6195.3 --> 6200.219
entire life

6197.04 --> 6204.0
those people were [ __ ] insane they

6200.219 --> 6207.4800000000005
had no idea about reality whatsoever

6204.0 --> 6211.139
they literally didn't understand

6207.48 --> 6213.54
the working people at all

6211.139 --> 6215.6990000000005
they would just treat them like like

6213.54 --> 6217.26
there were animals

6215.699 --> 6219.48
because they just did not understand

6217.26 --> 6223.9400000000005
they're completely deranged yeah that's

6219.48 --> 6223.94
what happens when you only have luxury

6224.34 --> 6229.58
and nothing to deserve it you become

6226.619 --> 6229.58
deranged

6229.76 --> 6235.08
and more natural people

6232.92 --> 6237.0
like can you imagine everybody would be

6235.08 --> 6238.8
like those French nobility people back

6237.0 --> 6240.06
then everybody being like that that's

6238.8 --> 6243.4400000000005
the only thing yeah guess what

6240.06 --> 6243.4400000000005
everybody's gonna die then

6249.179 --> 6251.719
right

6254.76 --> 6259.46
to know only luxury is death

6259.56 --> 6264.619000000001
it defeats the entire purpose of

6262.08 --> 6264.619
existing

6276.78 --> 6282.98
right without a challenge you don't

6278.94 --> 6282.98
deserve it and you know it

6283.619 --> 6288.54
and if you don't like knowing that

6286.08 --> 6290.46
because it's in your way makes you feel

6288.54 --> 6294.54
depressed then you might turn it off oh

6290.46 --> 6297.78
then you become abnormal and deranged

6294.54 --> 6301.139
demons gonna ride on your shoulders then

6297.78 --> 6303.3
it's gonna take more pieces of you and

6301.139 --> 6306.06
more pieces of you because everything is

6303.3 --> 6309.54
just there then to hide the obvious

6306.06 --> 6314.400000000001
truth that you don't deserve any of that

6309.54 --> 6319.639
and you become demonic and deranged

6314.4 --> 6319.638999999999
yeah luxury is the greatest Danger

6321.179 --> 6326.76
if there's too much of it

6323.639 --> 6328.38
compared to what you would have to do to

6326.76 --> 6330.900000000001
attain that

6328.38 --> 6334.400000000001
right that's why

6330.9 --> 6337.379999999999
a working man can really enjoy a party

6334.4 --> 6341.4
like really enjoy it

6337.38 --> 6342.78
well a rich person to them it's not that

6341.4 --> 6345.119
enjoyable

6342.78 --> 6347.639
because they do it all the time and they

6345.119 --> 6348.839999999999
don't really do anything or barely I

6347.639 --> 6352.08
mean they

6348.84 --> 6356.219
do business and all that

6352.08 --> 6358.619
but to them it's just like yeah sure I

6356.219 --> 6361.56
mean that's just another day in a week

6358.619 --> 6363.42
while two were working man that's like

6361.56 --> 6366.7390000000005
good day

6363.42 --> 6366.7390000000005
when they can finally

6367.02 --> 6371.219
put down

6369.0 --> 6374.159
the pressure of their responsibility and

6371.219 --> 6377.159
their work and just like party

6374.159 --> 6380.119
they enjoy it yeah

6377.159 --> 6380.119
see that pattern

6385.56 --> 6391.219
does f flattered early bird provide

6388.08 --> 6391.219
challenge in my life yeah

6392.88 --> 6395.06
foreign

6397.88 --> 6401.78
just keep my demons away

6402.48 --> 6405.199
well

6405.42 --> 6410.3
I have taken it upon myself to at least

6410.76 --> 6418.400000000001
attempt to get out of poverty somehow

6414.0 --> 6418.4
despite my position and my attitude

6419.1 --> 6424.56
in some way and that is a big challenge

6421.5 --> 6427.02
I I have not conceded to like I'm just

6424.56 --> 6428.639
gonna be bored like this forever no

6427.02 --> 6432.900000000001
[ __ ] way

6428.639 --> 6435.84
but I will have to suffer through it

6432.9 --> 6439.86
right living like this is a challenge

6435.84 --> 6442.32
has been for almost a decade now

6439.86 --> 6444.839999999999
it is a challenge

6442.32 --> 6448.38
can I handle it

6444.84 --> 6451.02
or will I become demonic

6448.38 --> 6452.82
well it seems like I can handle it but

6451.02 --> 6455.659000000001
it doesn't mean that I want to live like

6452.82 --> 6455.659
this all the time

6456.119 --> 6460.339999999999
forever no [ __ ] way

6462.119 --> 6465.839999999999
when I'm

6463.8 --> 6467.88
it's still challenging it's still

6465.84 --> 6471.0
interesting

6467.88 --> 6474.3
I do get to develop

6471.0 --> 6477.6
my vernacular a lot

6474.3 --> 6480.54
and just communicating

6477.6 --> 6484.320000000001
because if I don't communicate then I

6480.54 --> 6484.32
bewilder easily

6484.56 --> 6488.6990000000005
it even happened a bit like when I was

6486.78 --> 6490.44
with my ex because like literally she

6488.699 --> 6493.339999999999
was the only one I communicated to

6490.44 --> 6493.339999999999
literally

6495.48 --> 6500.459999999999
except for like maybe a phone call

6497.76 --> 6503.4800000000005
sometimes with somebody

6500.46 --> 6503.4800000000005
that sort of thing

6503.52 --> 6508.619000000001
I didn't have like a

6506.1 --> 6511.92
a group of people that it would

6508.619 --> 6513.36
constantly be facing like I do now

6511.92 --> 6515.9
I have to say this is much more

6513.36 --> 6515.9
fulfilling

6516.9 --> 6520.94
even though I also have to deal with

6518.46 --> 6520.94
trolls

6532.1 --> 6535.88
that's called a robot

6550.38 --> 6555.06
right but anyway yeah

6552.9 --> 6559.638999999999
maybe woodworking gummy bear

6555.06 --> 6559.639
but then again poop scooping can be

6560.04 --> 6566.78
you can use it as a punishment too it's

6562.56 --> 6570.659000000001
like oh so you're you're like

6566.78 --> 6572.099999999999
disobedient or whatever or you've you've

6570.659 --> 6575.159
failed something or you were terrible

6572.1 --> 6579.9800000000005
well do you go scoop that poop then well

6575.159 --> 6579.98
if you had an AI robot you can't do that

6582.42 --> 6587.4
because

6583.86 --> 6589.5599999999995
like that seems then ridiculous you

6587.4 --> 6590.759999999999
probably wouldn't even have the tools to

6589.56 --> 6592.4400000000005
do it then

6590.76 --> 6594.2390000000005
anyway

6592.44 --> 6597.299999999999
but I get it's not something you would

6594.239 --> 6599.04
like like doing but it's not about that

6597.3 --> 6601.9400000000005
it's about that it is challenging and

6599.04 --> 6601.94
that you gotta do it

6606.06 --> 6610.280000000001
knows when to scoop with roses

6613.08 --> 6617.699
what do you see as your biggest obstacle

6615.54 --> 6620.42
in getting out of poverty

6617.699 --> 6620.419999999999
uh

6622.619 --> 6625.4
Trust

6634.34 --> 6640.9400000000005
trust is the biggest problem where I

6637.199 --> 6640.94
don't trust it I don't trust

6641.159 --> 6648.679
corporations people with money

6644.52 --> 6648.679
I I just don't really trust them

6661.44 --> 6665.879999999999
right because I can't get out of poverty

6663.54 --> 6669.199
just having being in this situation

6665.88 --> 6672.719
social welfare and the support through

6669.199 --> 6677.159
my followers here

6672.719 --> 6679.619
I would have to engage out there

6677.159 --> 6683.339999999999
and then get entangled with people with

6679.619 --> 6685.98
money directly or indirectly

6683.34 --> 6689.46
to get something going

6685.98 --> 6692.04
right and I'm just not really good at

6689.46 --> 6694.619
that I mean I could probably do it it's

6692.04 --> 6697.44
just that I don't have this the

6694.619 --> 6699.299999999999
intuition for that I am too naturally

6697.44 --> 6702.659
trusting and then if somebody violates

6699.3 --> 6703.56
that trust it's like really it [ __ ] me

6702.659 --> 6706.98
up

6703.56 --> 6710.3
yeah guess what it's not a good trade

6706.98 --> 6710.299999999999
for a businessman yeah

6711.119 --> 6713.719
so

6714.659 --> 6720.659
what another approach is just find the

6718.199 --> 6723.9
right people

6720.659 --> 6726.119
that'll just have business and then kind

6723.9 --> 6728.58
of like connect up with them and see if

6726.119 --> 6730.739
I can

6728.58 --> 6734.719
take yeah

6730.739 --> 6734.718999999999
I don't know man I don't know yet

6737.159 --> 6741.08
I'm still here developing

6741.36 --> 6746.299999999999
hey metal slugs

6743.639 --> 6746.3
master

6756.719 --> 6760.8
you're the only one getting being

6758.28 --> 6763.32
punished yeah but

6760.8 --> 6765.06
it wasn't

6763.32 --> 6766.619
I'm just saying

6765.06 --> 6768.719
you want to discipline like your

6766.619 --> 6771.44
teenager or something you can just make

6768.719 --> 6771.44
them scoop it

6779.04 --> 6785.76
I don't know you get yet used to it

6782.639 --> 6788.96
I did some scooping myself back on when

6785.76 --> 6788.96
it was horseback riding

6789.179 --> 6792.679
I didn't even mind too much

6797.1 --> 6803.1
I just didn't like it that I was

6799.5 --> 6804.179
constantly being pun intended saddle up

6803.1 --> 6807.119000000001
with it

6804.179 --> 6809.04
that I don't know because I was like a

6807.119 --> 6810.599999999999
little bit socially awkward or something

6809.04 --> 6815.239
people just thought

6810.6 --> 6815.2390000000005
like just you just do that

6815.58 --> 6820.26
that was annoying

6817.98 --> 6822.839999999999
because I was kind of desperate for

6820.26 --> 6825.659000000001
opportunities to expand upon my social

6822.84 --> 6827.88
interaction capabilities

6825.659 --> 6830.339999999999
uh

6827.88 --> 6832.08
right anyway time has flown I'm gonna

6830.34 --> 6834.719
round out the show

6832.08 --> 6837.0
so thanks everyone for coming hope you

6834.719 --> 6841.44
liked this show I thought it was great

6837.0 --> 6843.719
fluid good subjects good Concepts I hope

6841.44 --> 6846.299999999999
you it sticks to mind

6843.719 --> 6849.92
right and I hope I also will get some

6846.3 --> 6849.92
support soon again

6849.96 --> 6853.139
because I think it's worth it I mean

6851.82 --> 6856.799999999999
this

6853.139 --> 6861.06
show what I've put down that's value

6856.8 --> 6864.02
and that deserves something I'd say

6861.06 --> 6867.119000000001
I mean maybe it's not as

6864.02 --> 6870.06
entertaining to an Owen Benjamin degree

6867.119 --> 6872.58
but I mean it is valuable Insight that

6870.06 --> 6877.34
I'm sharing here

6872.58 --> 6877.34
and I think I deserve support for that

6879.0 --> 6881.639
right

6880.32 --> 6884.159
isn't it

6881.639 --> 6886.1990000000005
or is it just some blabbermouth like the

6884.159 --> 6889.799999999999
trolls like to say

6886.199 --> 6894.44
I'm I mean coherent is it is it worth

6889.8 --> 6894.4400000000005
anything what I'm doing here or because

6895.5 --> 6901.5
I don't know with the way I can

6898.52 --> 6905.580000000001
understand and describe things

6901.5 --> 6907.76
I think I could like ask 500 euros an

6905.58 --> 6907.76
hour

6910.02 --> 6916.679
if I were to remodel my services

6914.219 --> 6918.36
instead of just doing it for everybody

6916.679 --> 6923.719
like that

6918.36 --> 6923.719
yeah because the return is insane

6927.0 --> 6932.159
and I deserve more than this

6929.82 --> 6935.099999999999
now whether you guys can help me with

6932.159 --> 6938.82
that is another matter but

6935.1 --> 6941.159000000001
I definitely do deserve more than this

6938.82 --> 6943.799999999999
so

6941.159 --> 6944.82
find people that are willing to support

6943.8 --> 6947.52
me

6944.82 --> 6950.759999999999
and people throw giant piles of money

6947.52 --> 6952.4400000000005
out there against other YouTubers why

6950.76 --> 6955.139
not with me

6952.44 --> 6957.48
why do you insist on not doing that with

6955.139 --> 6959.46
me people who typically do that out

6957.48 --> 6961.86
there

6959.46 --> 6964.7390000000005
I mean do you just like throwing money

6961.86 --> 6968.58
at people that are trying to fool you

6964.739 --> 6969.919999999999
or that it don't touch upon some kind of

6968.58 --> 6972.719
potentially

6969.92 --> 6973.86
risky area for your

6972.719 --> 6976.44
spirit

6973.86 --> 6979.259999999999
slightly uncomfortable you just you

6976.44 --> 6981.239
don't want that at all

6979.26 --> 6984.679
you just throw money at people that just

6981.239 --> 6984.678999999999
tell you what you want to hear only

6987.659 --> 6991.98
I don't know

6989.82 --> 6994.92
I would really appreciate if I got some

6991.98 --> 6998.5199999999995
PayPal for this I I deserve it

6994.92 --> 7001.219
and I'm gonna get kind of pissed off if

6998.52 --> 7003.38
I don't get any soon

7001.219 --> 7006.139
because

7003.38 --> 7008.0
yeah I am still in debt

7006.139 --> 7010.219
and I want to get out of this and I

7008.0 --> 7014.92
deserve it and I'm performing on a high

7010.219 --> 7014.92
level better like half a year ago

7015.38 --> 7020.119
so please donate to my PayPal I really

7017.78 --> 7022.28

I'm giving you really good advice with a

7025.4 --> 7029.679
lot of detail

7029.679 --> 7034.219
for decades

yeah my information that I've been

7034.219 --> 7040.4800000000005
presenting are still going to be
