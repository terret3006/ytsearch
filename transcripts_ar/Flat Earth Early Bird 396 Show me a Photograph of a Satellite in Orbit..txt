that would be much appreciated so today

68.39 --> 75.15
it's surprisingly dark that's one thing

72.869 --> 77.04
I'm noticing like I even kind of had to

75.15 --> 84.68
put the extra light on here because it's

77.04 --> 87.42
just so great for this time of day

84.68 --> 91.71000000000001
and it's kind of cold there's no wind

87.42 --> 99.96000000000001
though it's very moist still you can

91.71 --> 101.72
still see the puddles but yeah not the

99.96 --> 105.58999999999999
most beautiful Sunday I've been through

101.72 --> 105.59
but oh well ah

106.85 --> 113.03
so I've just green tea with me it's good

110.789 --> 113.03
enough

116.5 --> 124.66
so let's see use in chat soon as I can

119.5 --> 130.899
get my chat to become unbroken YouTube

124.66 --> 132.64
what he's having some updates I think

130.899 --> 135.49
anyway yeah there seems to be now a

132.64 --> 137.13
timestamp in every chat comment that's

135.49 --> 145.20000000000002
interesting

137.13 --> 145.2
anyway a gem was first think yeah

145.29 --> 153.85
flattered spaceman herbal Mart bomb clad

149.29 --> 156.72
Gator fish George Sanford good to see

153.85 --> 162.54
you that's probably more gonna leak in

156.72 --> 162.54
soon yes yesterday night was a very

162.57 --> 171.48999999999998
interesting and pretty heavy pretty

167.44 --> 176.26
heavy media situation night especially

171.49 --> 179.19
of didn't even think too much of it but

176.26 --> 184.39
we had Owen Benjamin had sort of like a

179.19 --> 189.94
bit of a rage moment but really I was

184.39 --> 192.7
there at and he was like getting really

189.94 --> 195.04
pissed off at some bears that were just

192.7 --> 196.03
seemed to be kind of like goofing and

195.04 --> 198.459
joking around

196.03 --> 201.989
at moments where it was they weren't

198.459 --> 204.37
paying super careful where were two

201.989 --> 206.709
super careful attention to what they

204.37 --> 210.94
were saying in chat at a moment when Big

206.709 --> 212.86
Bear was like really pissed off like he

210.94 --> 215.10999999999999
was really pissed off and I don't think

212.86 --> 216.28
that a lot of people really got that

215.11 --> 219.37
where that came from

216.28 --> 222.04
I got it though I think I think I got it

219.37 --> 225.19
I felt kind of say I get I just it felt

222.04 --> 227.88
natural what he was doing because in

225.19 --> 233.49
response to

227.88 --> 238.2
that that weird video from of nickel

233.49 --> 240.60000000000002
Nick twenties basically media's talking

238.2 --> 244.45999999999998
with the gang of gammas ben shapiro and

240.6 --> 246.63
his pregnant wife and yeah all the

244.46 --> 249.09
Lacroix person would have when told

246.63 --> 254.85
trolling and [ __ ] at first so there was

249.09 --> 259.83
a lot of banning and but yeah when when

254.85 --> 262.05
a guy that supposedly pro-america and

259.83 --> 264.75
that yeah that's of course when Benjamin

262.05 --> 269.07
takes that seriously is gonna basically

264.75 --> 272.01
harass a pregnant woman that and don't

269.07 --> 274.5
even get what they're doing it's so bad

272.01 --> 277.92
and I don't think that a lot of people

274.5 --> 281.82
got how bad that really is not yeah

277.92 --> 284.12
plenty of bears did but others didn't

281.82 --> 287.67
seem to understand why that would get

284.12 --> 291.9
yeah big bear so incredibly frustrated

287.67 --> 294.45
and like ready to kill this is because

291.9 --> 299.78999999999996
you never do that it's it's like the

294.45 --> 305.28
worst breaking of chivalry and yeah I

299.79 --> 309.24
totally got that and yeah afterwards the

305.28 --> 311.88
ugly Jew guy guy who's live streaming on

309.24 --> 316.76
D life as well just kind of like what I

311.88 --> 318.81
do or although more general subjects and

316.76 --> 321.75
oddities on the internet and everything

318.81 --> 326.94
but he didn't seem to he was like oh no

321.75 --> 328.8
to this and and then Nathan Stallman

326.94 --> 330.48
from lift avail kind of had the similar

328.8 --> 334.7
reaction I was like oh come on guys

330.48 --> 338.90000000000003
don't you get this don't you get this is

334.7 --> 338.9
everybody's all worried

339.81 --> 351.27
yeah AGM I know but the chivalry

347.78 --> 356.46
it's about chivalry it doesn't matter if

351.27 --> 362.28
somebody is like a horrific person if if

356.46 --> 366.57
they have a pregnant wife you don't go

362.28 --> 368.46
and mop him at such a moment and you

366.57 --> 371.43
could say oh he's just using it as cover

368.46 --> 374.84999999999997
it doesn't matter you could say that was

371.43 --> 377.72
kind of smart of him you can't then just

374.85 --> 382.5
say a green light no matter what it is

377.72 --> 385.53000000000003
wrong it is a harsh breaking of the

382.5 --> 387.81
chivalry unspoken code and you'd never

385.53 --> 399.419
do that and it's just terrible

387.81 --> 404.58
oh yeah I'm bit too big tumors it's not

399.419 --> 407.49
just bit too bit too verse mmm red pill

404.58 --> 410.09999999999997
philosophy has went to that platform and

407.49 --> 411.96000000000004
yesterday he did a very funny little

410.1 --> 414.89000000000004
hangout and bit tube I made an account

411.96 --> 417.21
quickly so I could comment there and

414.89 --> 421.02
yeah bit tube seems like an interesting

417.21 --> 422.7
platform it seems like there is there's

421.02 --> 426.93
still a lot of work to do on it there

422.7 --> 428.76
were some weird anomalies and like it

426.93 --> 434.49
seems a bit incomplete but it's a

428.76 --> 438.57
promising little platform and yeah I had

434.49 --> 443.1
a lot of fun over at red pills he he

438.57 --> 447.65999999999997
found I found a clip from from the globe

443.1 --> 450.81
light tour of a British guy that was

447.66 --> 453.72
acting acting out totally like a real

450.81 --> 455.64
fanatical baller zealot as they were do

453.72 --> 458.76000000000005
in chat but he was doing it face to face

455.64 --> 465.58
and even like getting physical and yeah

458.76 --> 467.99
red red pill philosophy he he noticed a

465.58 --> 472.78999999999996
similarities between a certain picture

467.99 --> 475.34000000000003
that he had used for his globs little

472.79 --> 476.09000000000003
mean and it kind of looked similar to

475.34 --> 477.91999999999996
that guy

476.09 --> 480.38
so the it was hilarious so if you

477.92 --> 483.38
haven't seen it then check out red pill

480.38 --> 486.56
philosophies bit Tube channel he had a

483.38 --> 489.17
small video on YouTube with a link to

486.56 --> 491.42
where he did that and you can still play

489.17 --> 493.46000000000004
it back because of the recordings they

491.42 --> 496.64000000000004
stay recorded you can play them back at

493.46 --> 504.46999999999997
your leash so check that out red pill

496.64 --> 507.95
philosophy that was fun what else

504.47 --> 511.94000000000005
I stayed up we too late terrible I

507.95 --> 518.93
shouldn't I should stop doing that kind

511.94 --> 521.15
of feeling this strain of it but yeah

518.93 --> 525.26
there was just so much going on and it

521.15 --> 528.49
got me a bit excited hello see what else

525.26 --> 528.49
came in chat in the meanwhile

532.55 --> 541.87
beyond your experience michael roark

537.14 --> 548.74
Amanda young mama Claire get the fish

541.87 --> 548.74
the red path Sean Becker Martin Ellen

548.77 --> 561.41
Jaron opt out yeah welcome to the show

556.85 --> 564.98
oh really you find red pill philosophy

561.41 --> 571.13
and bearing okay well to each their own

564.98 --> 575.54
you know like I I think I really get the

571.13 --> 578.029
guy because like he is pretty smart but

575.54 --> 581.02
he's also like us screw that I'm gonna

578.029 --> 586.49
do just how I feel he's not very

581.02 --> 589.029
compromising so and he I don't know I

586.49 --> 591.74
find him kind of consistent and I

589.029 --> 594.77
respect what he does it's not how I

591.74 --> 597.77
would do things but I get it but yeah if

594.77 --> 600.35
you don't like that then oh well you

597.77 --> 602.9499999999999
know you don't have to like every person

600.35 --> 610.6
on the internet if you know what I mean

602.95 --> 610.6
yeah no NW dude

612.16 --> 617.25
kamikaze Gilmore Jeffery bill

621.55 --> 624.91
Stacy be

629.78 --> 635.66
oh yeah there was also eventually too

633.59 --> 637.25
many too many live streams at the same

635.66 --> 638.9599999999999
time it always happens like there's a

637.25 --> 640.31
void and then certainly all the live

638.96 --> 642.83
streams start popping up because

640.31 --> 644.42
everybody sees hmm there's so much

642.83 --> 646.5500000000001
silence maybe I should start a hangout

644.42 --> 649.76
and then everybody simultaneously starts

646.55 --> 651.92
a hangout it's kind of typical and

649.76 --> 654.08
pre-planned stuff as well of course in

651.92 --> 657.29
certain time slots but yeah Martin Lee

654.08 --> 657.6500000000001
together hangout got kind of crowded in

657.29 --> 659.7199999999999
there

657.65 --> 661.4
to be fair I kind of stepped away after

659.72 --> 665.4200000000001
ten minutes because there were other

661.4 --> 671.92
things going on as well sorry Martin it

665.42 --> 671.92
was nice being in your chat and

673.9 --> 676.98
[Music]

681.059 --> 683.8689999999999
hmm

684.75 --> 691.11
oh yeah yeah Karen b.i I didn't see that

687.93 --> 694.829
life I got a look before the show

691.11 --> 697.439
Karen B had a a physics teacher flat

694.829 --> 699.5089999999999
smacking his class with with some

697.439 --> 703.3499999999999
difficulty though like the the class was

699.509 --> 706.41
very resistant but yeah there was

703.35 --> 708.9300000000001
fascinating to see and I really want to

706.41 --> 709.92
know the follow-up of that what happened

708.93 --> 712.41
what is gonna happen

709.92 --> 715.29
I I hope he's not gonna get fired or

712.41 --> 719.129
something for that but it was very

715.29 --> 722.759
interesting to see so do take a look at

719.129 --> 727.74
Karen B latest video from six hours ago

722.759 --> 731.519
and subscribe to your channel oh yeah

727.74 --> 734.009
also we got old Benjamin comedy like a

731.519 --> 737.899
side Channel that's still on YouTube

734.009 --> 740.129
showed a very old I think very old

737.899 --> 741.949
relatively old you could hear that he

740.129 --> 747.779
was addressing things differently and

741.949 --> 750.6289999999999
having different approaches so it seems

747.779 --> 752.97
like some of his older comedy work and

750.629 --> 757.23
it was kind of good but it is weird to

752.97 --> 760.35
see like the old bear versus the new Big

757.23 --> 762.4490000000001
Bear that was interesting

760.35 --> 766.5500000000001
so yeah me watching videos videos

762.449 --> 771.959
watching videos she seems to be like a

766.55 --> 774.5
professional video watcher now but there

771.959 --> 779.4699999999999
is some really good stuff out there so I

774.5 --> 781.92
think you know is that

779.47 --> 781.9200000000001
it's this

789.37 --> 792.37
hmm

799.11 --> 807.21
okay interesting seems to be yes

804.03 --> 810.6899999999999
somebody draw our George stirrup

807.21 --> 817.62
I don't know from when that was but he

810.69 --> 824.25
has is having a premiere in its Spanish

817.62 --> 827.37
I think anyway that's happening our also

824.25 --> 830.85
a few it seems to be more like a

827.37 --> 838.4
slideshow though more general Flat Earth

830.85 --> 838.4
video anyway let's see what else

840.11 --> 843.399
[Music]

862.35 --> 873.12
yeah I've been watching some silly

864.54 --> 875.8399999999999
videos that I like didn't watch ball

873.12 --> 882.18
busters it was another premiere and just

875.84 --> 885.12
you know to me to me personally it's

882.18 --> 887.28
getting a bit old like quantum eraser

885.12 --> 891.9
presentations I get it now

887.28 --> 894.72
but he's doing it always in such a

891.9 --> 896.97
similar way that it's valuable

894.72 --> 900.3000000000001
information but I've heard these things

896.97 --> 901.59
so many times it's just I really don't

900.3 --> 906.2099999999999
want to hang around anymore

901.59 --> 915.5300000000001
unless I can actually contribute all

906.21 --> 915.5300000000001
right I think that's it so

940.26 --> 947.11
okay Sean Becker that's bizarre

942.76 --> 949.51
I shut down a debate yesterday when

947.11 --> 951.64
someone said that they only trusted

949.51 --> 956.86
mainstream media and sources by showing

951.64 --> 959.14
in scripted media playlist yeah I guess

956.86 --> 963.82
that some people out there just really

959.14 --> 968.5
really want to double down on the main

963.82 --> 971.4300000000001
narrative like I guess government

968.5 --> 975.76
signaling whatever you want to call it

971.43 --> 982.5899999999999
authority signaling it's weird it's

975.76 --> 982.59
creepy it's very gamma surrender issed

989.89 --> 993.81
oh okay

1003.22 --> 1008.87
okay well welcome back

1005.899 --> 1012.83
kaylynn truth seeker free energy

1008.87 --> 1014.18
researcher try not to spam too much but

1012.83 --> 1020.0
I see you want to continue the

1014.18 --> 1024.6789999999999
conversation from yesterday and you

1020.0 --> 1026.87
don't have to get all giggly okay you

1024.679 --> 1029.6000000000001
getting timed out it's not rolling on

1026.87 --> 1034.52
the floor laughing you are being

1029.6 --> 1036.9199999999998
extremely annoying but as for your

1034.52 --> 1039.05
statement over there just wanted to

1036.92 --> 1041.47
state that there is no energy in the

1039.05 --> 1044.569
ether and she's only created when it is

1041.47 --> 1053.8
turned or interrupted then she is

1044.569 --> 1058.309
changing flux G's rights okay well that

1053.8 --> 1060.23
really doesn't solve anything if you're

1058.309 --> 1062.99
gonna state it like that you're just

1060.23 --> 1070.13
gonna say no it doesn't have energy well

1062.99 --> 1071.9
it's coming from somewhere and so if

1070.13 --> 1075.3200000000002
you're gonna say no the ether has no

1071.9 --> 1079.46
energy well how are you how are you

1075.32 --> 1082.79
saying that it doesn't because it

1079.46 --> 1084.58
doesn't because you can't detect it you

1082.79 --> 1091.61
can only detect it when you actually

1084.58 --> 1094.309
open it up as you say when it's

1091.61 --> 1095.99
interrupted or turned tapped into yeah

1094.309 --> 1097.4289999999999
that's when it's unleashed but that

1095.99 --> 1100.07
doesn't mean that it doesn't have any

1097.429 --> 1102.8300000000002
energy it just means that you can only

1100.07 --> 1107.0
detect it the moment you are tapping

1102.83 --> 1109.22
into it so it seems kind of like you're

1107.0 --> 1111.83
making an unnecessary puzzle for

1109.22 --> 1114.17
yourself here just to avoid the argument

1111.83 --> 1115.9399999999998
and I guess crack down on the laws of

1114.17 --> 1118.78
thermodynamics which you seem to be so

1115.94 --> 1118.78
keen on doing

1120.82 --> 1124.95
it's kind of dumb in my opinion

1127.36 --> 1130.9799999999998
[Music]

1143.23 --> 1149.42
subjective that's ridiculous

1146.33 --> 1155.35
if the energy is going to interact with

1149.42 --> 1155.3500000000001
matter why are you calling it subjective

1157.54 --> 1163.97
that does I don't know it seems like

1161.15 --> 1166.48
you're kind of off here in in your angle

1163.97 --> 1166.48
of approach

1179.88 --> 1185.7600000000002
right Sean Becker well exactly that is

1182.97 --> 1187.83
the way that I would say it and you can

1185.76 --> 1192.44
say oh the ether doesn't have any energy

1187.83 --> 1194.9399999999998
when you don't do anything with it yeah

1192.44 --> 1196.679
sure because the energy is not there

1194.94 --> 1198.9
right it's you can't measure it you

1196.679 --> 1204.3300000000002
can't feel it you can sense it in a

1198.9 --> 1206.49
direct sense well until you do something

1204.33 --> 1211.11
with it but then to declare that doesn't

1206.49 --> 1214.919
have any energy no it probably does and

1211.11 --> 1218.9699999999998
I wonder sometimes like if you tap

1214.919 --> 1221.3400000000001
enough energy from it in this fashion

1218.97 --> 1226.08
there's a likelihood that there's gonna

1221.34 --> 1229.6499999999999
be a universal reaction to it at some

1226.08 --> 1233.46
level because that energy is being

1229.65 --> 1236.97
subtracted as it were from the field

1233.46 --> 1241.83
from a field that is normally beyond our

1236.97 --> 1245.49
reach or well not very apparently in our

1241.83 --> 1248.549
reach and well if that energy is going

1245.49 --> 1250.47
to be detracted then that means that the

1248.549 --> 1252.45
overall energy is going to be a lesson

1250.47 --> 1257.549
in some way and I don't know what that

1252.45 --> 1259.26
energy actually does universally one

1257.549 --> 1262.559
could even argue that if you'd have

1259.26 --> 1268.89
enough energy tapping into the ether and

1262.559 --> 1273.1789999999999
if it's like super large like billions

1268.89 --> 1277.5800000000002
of gigawatts and [ __ ] that maybe that

1273.179 --> 1280.1100000000001
would basically detract energy from the

1277.58 --> 1282.6
foundations of life itself

1280.11 --> 1286.37
that could be a side effect a very

1282.6 --> 1291.4189999999999
unfortunate side effect that which yeah

1286.37 --> 1293.76
we don't know but it could be it makes

1291.419 --> 1296.01
sense in accordance to the laws of

1293.76 --> 1299.07
thermodynamics because the energy has to

1296.01 --> 1301.44
be coming from somewhere there seems to

1299.07 --> 1306.33
be a lot of it but that doesn't mean

1301.44 --> 1312.2
that you can have infinite energy out of

1306.33 --> 1312.1999999999998
nothing that's what I suspect

1313.86 --> 1327.25
makes more sense that way what are you

1322.09 --> 1330.36
talking about quantum field what quantum

1327.25 --> 1332.62
fields do you even know what quantum is

1330.36 --> 1334.27
look there's there are some things

1332.62 --> 1338.59
coming out okay

1334.27 --> 1340.87
Dejan and me well you could say that in

1338.59 --> 1343.649
a way anam was kind of first but he's

1340.87 --> 1347.039
kind of like stuck to that wave you know

1343.649 --> 1350.9499999999998
but I was on a second

1347.039 --> 1354.179
I'm getting on on John's quantum eraser

1350.95 --> 1356.169
zas about this and spoke out pretty

1354.179 --> 1362.3990000000001
pretty riff vividly

1356.169 --> 1366.7
in recent days and yeah datian is now

1362.399 --> 1370.0
starting to see it and he actually found

1366.7 --> 1371.919
he is Asian is a much better researcher

1370.0 --> 1374.02
than me he has better sources he knows

1371.919 --> 1376.69
how to take better and he's been looking

1374.02 --> 1379.48
around for actual proof of the

1376.69 --> 1383.89
wavefunction collapse and found some

1379.48 --> 1389.23
interesting reports various one in

1383.89 --> 1391.409
particular that I'll read out where is

1389.23 --> 1391.409
it

1395.37 --> 1404.2299999999998
right from Cornell University and yeah

1400.929 --> 1406.96
you you already know that quantum eraser

1404.23 --> 1411.299
is gonna have a certain type of response

1406.96 --> 1415.42
I don't really care I just care about

1411.299 --> 1418.72
what it kind of tells me because this

1415.42 --> 1426.94
does seem to be an honest thing here

1418.72 --> 1428.98
okay this is in 2012 revised 2015 it was

1426.94 --> 1431.8300000000002
recently proposed that the fringe

1428.98 --> 1433.75
visibility in the interference pattern

1431.83 --> 1437.83
of the double slip diffraction

1433.75 --> 1442.03
experiment with the helium nitrogen

1437.83 --> 1444.22
laser would thing whatever was reduced

1442.03 --> 1446.5
to a consequence of the focused

1444.22 --> 1449.1100000000001
attention of a participants on the

1446.5 --> 1452.11
double slip that initiated the collapse

1449.11 --> 1454.809
of the photon wave function a thorough

1452.11 --> 1457.02
examination of the reported apparatus

1454.809 --> 1459.76
and diffraction pattern data is

1457.02 --> 1463.78
presented here revealing a number of

1459.76 --> 1468.37
inconsistencies in the experimental

1463.78 --> 1471.16
setup the hypothesis for wavefunction

1468.37 --> 1474.309
collapse under the proposed experimental

1471.16 --> 1477.4
conditions is found problematic as the

1474.309 --> 1485.799
use of a single photon source is

1477.4 --> 1489.99
demanded oh I kind of forgot to show but

1485.799 --> 1489.99
yeah there it is

1491.82 --> 1495.24
Thank You Dejah

1507.85 --> 1523.87
yeah isn't that ironic or whatever you

1516.8 --> 1523.87
want to think of it so yeah

1528.72 --> 1536.06
I don't think light is a particle in the

1532.44 --> 1540.6000000000001
sense as it has been defined there is no

1536.06 --> 1543.99
invisible energy quanta minimum it was

1540.6 --> 1545.85
just an arbitrary amount that was set

1543.99 --> 1547.92
based on a readout and then just

1545.85 --> 1550.32
pointing it this is what it must be

1547.92 --> 1552.41
amount even though the actual readout

1550.32 --> 1556.7
showed much more complicated things

1552.41 --> 1561.63
that's what I suspected from the start

1556.7 --> 1568.95
and yeah it seems there's something to

1561.63 --> 1573.69
it so yeah that's interesting I wonder

1568.95 --> 1576.18
what they Jen will dig up further yeah I

1573.69 --> 1580.44
think that light is not a indivisible

1576.18 --> 1582.3600000000001
unit of energy quanta with all the

1580.44 --> 1584.16
presuppositions through quantum

1582.36 --> 1586.1699999999998
mechanics that come from with it with

1584.16 --> 1588.3500000000001
the ridiculous being a two-place at the

1586.17 --> 1591.1200000000001
same time and all that nonsense

1588.35 --> 1593.4599999999998
all based on that it can't divide any

1591.12 --> 1595.86
further which it just seems completely

1593.46 --> 1598.17
ridiculous to me now I'm pretty sure

1595.86 --> 1602.76
that it's rather like it just an energy

1598.17 --> 1605.79
beam it could be like a globule but I

1602.76 --> 1608.28
think visualizing it as a beam is much

1605.79 --> 1611.97
more sensible it even already

1608.28 --> 1616.11
intuitively works out if you look at how

1611.97 --> 1619.89
for example emulation visuals ray

1616.11 --> 1622.9499999999998
tracing ray it's a R it's not a particle

1619.89 --> 1626.6100000000001
Tracy no it's a ray it's a ray tracing

1622.95 --> 1631.14
yeah yeah learn it in a 90's ray tracing

1626.61 --> 1634.6699999999998
not particle tracing right so I think

1631.14 --> 1639.0600000000002
that light is rays of infinitely

1634.67 --> 1643.3500000000001
divisible energy cuantas can be split up

1639.06 --> 1645.45
indefinitely widen up split up further

1643.35 --> 1647.52
split up further split up further narrow

1645.45 --> 1652.41
down arrow down compacted compact all

1647.52 --> 1656.79
that and the slider of the energy quanta

1652.41 --> 1659.4
is basically as far as you can imagine

1656.79 --> 1661.69
it to be until it can no longer be

1659.4 --> 1664.5400000000002
registered

1661.69 --> 1668.13
doesn't mean that it's actually not less

1664.54 --> 1668.1299999999999
that's what I think

1676.13 --> 1679.239
[Music]

1679.32 --> 1695.27
Oh his disciple I wouldn't go for no

1686.19 --> 1699.6000000000001
dome I think that dome is simply a an

1695.27 --> 1704.22
easier conceptualization of the

1699.6 --> 1707.82
container that must be there and yeah a

1704.22 --> 1710.58
dome is much more direct much more

1707.82 --> 1713.9399999999998
narrow down and easier to understand for

1710.58 --> 1717.03
people but I I personally have grave

1713.94 --> 1725.6000000000001
doubts that it is a literal spherical

1717.03 --> 1730.23
like dome or convex dome or anything

1725.6 --> 1733.86
because that setup would extremely

1730.23 --> 1738.69
narrow down the potential orientation of

1733.86 --> 1740.8799999999999
the realm because that type of firmament

1738.69 --> 1747.39
that type of container would only

1740.88 --> 1750.75
function within a disc orientation realm

1747.39 --> 1754.5900000000001
and I have strong doubts that it is

1750.75 --> 1758.61
exactly that although yeah again I think

1754.59 --> 1760.86
that was probably designed visualized in

1758.61 --> 1762.6899999999998
order to make it a little bit more

1760.86 --> 1765.6299999999999
understandable for the general people

1762.69 --> 1767.25
and not make them panic I think that is

1765.63 --> 1770.69
probably what that thing was designed

1767.25 --> 1770.69
for and probably kept

1781.809 --> 1787.599
really you think so good serpent I don't

1785.289 --> 1791.08
know if I am look the problem is I'm a

1787.599 --> 1792.7
theorist I'm not a very ambitious

1791.08 --> 1794.769
theorist in the sense that I'm

1792.7 --> 1796.719
constantly writing papers sending that

1794.769 --> 1806.859
to universities and all that no I am

1796.719 --> 1809.769
just a speculator thinker and hey I just

1806.859 --> 1812.009
think I'm onto something and there

1809.769 --> 1816.159
should be people out there that are

1812.009 --> 1822.059
gonna see what I see and that do have

1816.159 --> 1827.229
more grip on that scene where they can

1822.059 --> 1829.389
progress this insight and maybe do write

1827.229 --> 1832.799
papers and who knows maybe somebody

1829.389 --> 1836.1999999999998
wants to give me some credit or try to

1832.799 --> 1838.57
go for it and use me as a as a

1836.2 --> 1840.6290000000001
counsellor or as an adviser or whatever

1838.57 --> 1844.299
you want to call it I'm up for that

1840.629 --> 1847.1789999999999
absolutely I'd love to do the actual

1844.299 --> 1852.399
physical experiments and for example has

1847.179 --> 1854.799
been proposed even by by John like Oh

1852.399 --> 1858.82
get that set up yourself do it yourself

1854.799 --> 1865.599
oh yeah I I want to do that but I'm just

1858.82 --> 1867.82
very suspicious of any group that is

1865.599 --> 1870.2189999999998
funded in order to uphold certain

1867.82 --> 1872.619
knowledge that they are completely

1870.219 --> 1875.919
honest I will be very suspicious I will

1872.619 --> 1878.4399999999998
be scrutinizing that set up to no end

1875.919 --> 1880.5700000000002
and it's gonna get people a jeté tits

1878.44 --> 1882.94
just like yeah why don't you why can't

1880.57 --> 1886.239
we just do it no I'm gonna take at least

1882.94 --> 1888.489
like three hours to freaking screw this

1886.239 --> 1892.859
thing apart and literally see what is

1888.489 --> 1897.909
all there I'm not gonna trust anything I

1892.859 --> 1901.4189999999999
want to absolutely know if I'm gonna

1897.909 --> 1903.719
engage in in physically testing this

1901.419 --> 1903.719
thing

1906.72 --> 1910.2
[Music]

1912.29 --> 1919.7
yeah no no I won't be delighted obi-wan

1916.74 --> 1919.7
do globey

1928.6 --> 1938.33
and I have been to a observatory some

1932.45 --> 1943.88
time ago though look I even remembered

1938.33 --> 1947.809
being to this don't remember I think it

1943.88 --> 1952.8500000000001
was little older even this NASA themed

1947.809 --> 1955.309
thing and there was like this telescope

1952.85 --> 1958.58
installed there with a hole in the roof

1955.309 --> 1962.809
and then wasn't cursed like oh yeah we

1958.58 --> 1965.4499999999998
got it zoomed in on some planet so then

1962.809 --> 1967.7
I looked into that freaking telescope

1965.45 --> 1970.8500000000001
right it was a big thing was a really

1967.7 --> 1975.47
really big one and I looked in it and I

1970.85 --> 1979.309
literally saw a freaking paper cutout of

1975.47 --> 1983.029
a planet it was the most embarrassing

1979.309 --> 1987.02
thing of everything and I was like my

1983.029 --> 1989.69
god like if you let anyone with some

1987.02 --> 1992.6589999999999
kind of proper eyesight see this they're

1989.69 --> 1996.049
just gonna be super insulted and hurt if

1992.659 --> 1999.3500000000001
they believe any of this you can't do

1996.049 --> 2001.6
that and that was from like yeah from

1999.35 --> 2003.61
kind of a global perspective because I

2001.6 --> 2005.62
already knew back then like a NASA's

2003.61 --> 2008.529
full of trickery but I still believe

2005.62 --> 2012.1299999999999
that we could do that you know that back

2008.529 --> 2013.96
then but I saw that it's like dude you

2012.13 --> 2018.659
can't show this to kids it'll break

2013.96 --> 2018.659
their hearts this what are you doing

2020.399 --> 2026.37
so yeah I've seen through one of those

2023.14 --> 2029.5590000000002
things a big one and it was absolutely

2026.37 --> 2031.539
embarrassing I don't remember where it

2029.559 --> 2036.25
was when it was I remember with what

2031.539 --> 2037.539
kind of people I was but I just know

2036.25 --> 2040.45
that I looked through one of those

2037.539 --> 2043.299
things and just I was really pissed off

2040.45 --> 2046.6490000000001
like how dare you show that to children

2043.299 --> 2046.649
that's just an insult

2050.389 --> 2053.389
anyway

2066.75 --> 2075.119
huh okay well hey his disciple I don't

2072.51 --> 2078.3300000000004
know exactly where you're drawing these

2075.119 --> 2081.51
conclusions from concerning the the

2078.33 --> 2084.33
nature the geometrical nature of this

2081.51 --> 2089.01
sealing as it were but yeah I totally

2084.33 --> 2092.0099999999998
agree with you I think that a flat top

2089.01 --> 2095.03
and it doesn't have to be perfectly flat

2092.01 --> 2098.76
all the way it could potentially be

2095.03 --> 2101.4
literally just an endless looping flat

2098.76 --> 2103.349
surface that rests there may be some

2101.4 --> 2105.1800000000003
kind of pillar somewhere or at some

2103.349 --> 2109.8300000000004
point indeed there could be a touchdown

2105.18 --> 2114.27
there could be a certain I don't know

2109.83 --> 2118.65
but it seems that a perfect flat top for

2114.27 --> 2123.119
most of our realm is very sensible to me

2118.65 --> 2126.78
I think that is what it is but I have no

2123.119 --> 2129.75
proof for it yet but that seems design

2126.78 --> 2133.23
wise very sensible to me and it leaves

2129.75 --> 2136.17
open a lot of options as to what the

2133.23 --> 2140.43
realm can even be it leaves open a disk

2136.17 --> 2144.349
it leaves open a looping rectangle or an

2140.43 --> 2144.3489999999997
irregular curved loop

2157.31 --> 2162.44
Matthew lingard it's ridiculous

2167.97 --> 2173.4199999999996
yeah The Container that has to be there

2170.46 --> 2178.14
in order for us to breathe gas pressure

2173.42 --> 2179.91
that container you don't have to know

2178.14 --> 2184.44
the shape of the container you don't

2179.91 --> 2188.6099999999997
have to know the nature of it whether

2184.44 --> 2193.59
it's the energy matter or simply a loop

2188.61 --> 2198.1200000000003
or where there is no more volume for a

2193.59 --> 2200.07
matter to go into a container is there

2198.12 --> 2202.08
because it has to be because if it

2200.07 --> 2205.4900000000002
wasn't we would not be breathing gas

2202.08 --> 2205.49
pressure it's as simple as that

2206.15 --> 2212.09
there is containment and that's a fact

2219.13 --> 2227.4700000000003
all right well Joseph three six nine

2221.779 --> 2227.47
yeah that is part of it a dome the basic

2227.98 --> 2239.72
that my sphere or convex type sphere

2235.45 --> 2241.8489999999997
overlaying the realm is an easy way for

2239.72 --> 2244.1299999999997
people to understand containment they

2241.849 --> 2245.539
take like a snow globe there's water in

2244.13 --> 2248.539
there and then it's like yeah it's being

2245.539 --> 2251.75
contained by that dome it's very easy

2248.539 --> 2254.599
for people to understand that's why I

2251.75 --> 2256.97
think that they use that the funny thing

2254.599 --> 2259.6400000000003
was I was talking about this base

2256.97 --> 2261.68
specifically three years ago

2259.64 --> 2264.14
you can watch back my flatter talks

2261.68 --> 2267.109
videos I literally address this this

2264.14 --> 2272.24
very specific thing the psychology

2267.109 --> 2276.44
behind the the likely decision to go for

2272.24 --> 2278.66
a disc with us with a snow globe dome in

2276.44 --> 2280.64
order to make it more understandable for

2278.66 --> 2282.95
the general public easier for them to

2280.64 --> 2287.5389999999998
switch away from the delusions of the

2282.95 --> 2290.6899999999996
globe as a social engineer maneuver like

2287.539 --> 2293.63
a temporary step or a migration away

2290.69 --> 2297.73
from the globe doesn't mean that it is

2293.63 --> 2302.3900000000003
absolute empirical truth all of that

2297.73 --> 2305.5
just means that it's easier to convey to

2302.39 --> 2305.5
make people understand

2314.58 --> 2325.68
well NW dude you're you're presuming

2320.77 --> 2328.24
that they know so much more than us

2325.68 --> 2330.49
that's a funny thing that it's like the

2328.24 --> 2331.27
elitist complex that like the New World

2330.49 --> 2334.4199999999996
Order

2331.27 --> 2336.28
complex even if you're gonna assume that

2334.42 --> 2338.11
there's going to be some nefarious group

2336.28 --> 2340.8100000000004
there holding secrets and trying to

2338.11 --> 2344.44
control everyone it's very easy for

2340.81 --> 2348.1
people to psychologically take that into

2344.44 --> 2349.78
extremity and assume that those in

2348.1 --> 2353.98
control know everything

2349.78 --> 2356.98
well they don't they never do it's even

2353.98 --> 2361.18
a natural lesson not in that position

2356.98 --> 2365.35
that I try to convey a wise man knows

2361.18 --> 2368.44
they know nothing that that means

2365.35 --> 2370.66
everyone and so even the controllers

2368.44 --> 2372.58
with some extra trinkets with some extra

2370.66 --> 2377.37
knowledge are much more likely to just

2372.58 --> 2380.35
have a wide preponderance of easy tricks

2377.37 --> 2382.6
that people don't know about that have

2380.35 --> 2384.61
been woven into cultural society for

2382.6 --> 2386.71
them to utilize that is probably the

2384.61 --> 2390.61
most secret knowledge that they have not

2386.71 --> 2392.38
of what the reality actually is that's

2390.61 --> 2394.75
the whole issue these people are so

2392.38 --> 2396.9100000000003
stuck into controlling into looking

2394.75 --> 2399.58
downwards into looking into that matter

2396.91 --> 2402.93
and how to control it they stopped

2399.58 --> 2405.8199999999997
looking as to what the truth is

2402.93 --> 2410.44
so to assume that they all know the

2405.82 --> 2416.9500000000003
truth is very short-sighted very

2410.44 --> 2420.42
short-sighted it's a big problem it's a

2416.95 --> 2420.4199999999996
challenge it's a big one

2424.609 --> 2429.09
and now that doesn't mean that there

2426.75 --> 2431.96
aren't any individuals among the

2429.09 --> 2434.4900000000002
controllers that are very curious to it

2431.96 --> 2437.73
it doesn't automatically mean that they

2434.49 --> 2441.24
know it all or that they even know how

2437.73 --> 2454.34
to gain that knowledge they just may be

2441.24 --> 2456.72
curious and that's it yeah but usually

2454.34 --> 2459.359
people that concern themselves with

2456.72 --> 2463.109
controlling the entire world and money

2459.359 --> 2465.5099999999998
and people's minds don't have time to

2463.109 --> 2467.88
explore the mysteries of the universe as

2465.51 --> 2472.32
they say or the world their realm they

2467.88 --> 2476.15
don't have time for that [ __ ] too busy

2472.32 --> 2476.15
keeping everything under control

2484.2 --> 2487.2
right

2492.51 --> 2500.2000000000003
and I've even considered say for example

2496.42 --> 2502.9900000000002
okay Vatican Library there is another

2500.2 --> 2504.43
secret one where all the supposed secret

2502.99 --> 2507.1899999999996
knowledge has been gathered over the

2504.43 --> 2512.22
ages that is being erased from general

2507.19 --> 2514.66
public knowledge is being kept well just

2512.22 --> 2516.4599999999996
let's presume for a moment that some

2514.66 --> 2519.79
people would get the opportunity to

2516.46 --> 2521.29
learn everything who's to say that from

2519.79 --> 2522.94
their angle of approach and what they

2521.29 --> 2527.07
had to do to get in there in the first

2522.94 --> 2531.4900000000002
place will allow them to actually grasp

2527.07 --> 2535.2400000000002
what it all is if you ever considered

2531.49 --> 2538.39
that they may know it but will they

2535.24 --> 2540.5699999999997
understand it they might memorize it but

2538.39 --> 2546.3599999999997
will they understand what they memorized

2540.57 --> 2546.36
there's no guarantee for this you know

2555.85 --> 2561.94
yeah yeah let's put on some extra light

2558.65 --> 2561.94
is still so dark here

2579.64 --> 2587.81
now James Mason even with gravity the

2582.77 --> 2590.05
globe falls apart like in so many ways

2587.81 --> 2595.84
it's hilarious the whole gas pressure

2590.05 --> 2598.6400000000003
situation is so bad it's it's like

2595.84 --> 2601.4900000000002
fractal bad it's bad on every

2598.64 --> 2603.83
conceivable level and I'll try to

2601.49 --> 2606.14
explain it I kind of discovered this on

2603.83 --> 2608.36
the Flat Earth debates while ago and

2606.14 --> 2612.89
aftershow got to present that for a

2608.36 --> 2615.38
moment so okay let's first go with right

2612.89 --> 2618.23
gas pressure on earth in supposed it

2615.38 --> 2622.13
presupposes open system the outer space

2618.23 --> 2626.45
vacuum or sort of vacuum enough vacuum

2622.13 --> 2629.0
huge amount of volume right so gravity

2626.45 --> 2632.08
is supposed to hold that gas to a ball

2629.0 --> 2634.82
the problem is gravity is not a force

2632.08 --> 2636.95
you can think of it as a force but it's

2634.82 --> 2639.7400000000002
not really so it's supposed to be

2636.95 --> 2643.3399999999997
bending of space-time well then you can

2639.74 --> 2645.2299999999996
conceptually imagine that there's holes

2643.34 --> 2648.11
in space where matter would miraculously

2645.23 --> 2650.48
gather and that would be understood as

2648.11 --> 2652.82
gravity it wouldn't explain how that

2650.48 --> 2653.21
worked out just woods seems to work like

2652.82 --> 2656.32
that

2653.21 --> 2659.3
right okay that doesn't actually solve

2656.32 --> 2662.78
the gas pressure situation it's just

2659.3 --> 2667.7000000000003
like okay that's where the matter will

2662.78 --> 2672.71
be drawn to that doesn't help gas

2667.7 --> 2674.39
pressure stay within that atmosphere

2672.71 --> 2675.44
opposing the entire outer space universe

2674.39 --> 2677.42
no not at all

2675.44 --> 2679.94
because gravity is still not a force see

2677.42 --> 2683.33
see that's the problem okay let's take a

2679.94 --> 2686.48
next step that was step number one next

2683.33 --> 2690.44
step let's assume that gravity really is

2686.48 --> 2692.9900000000002
a force right okay let's look into the

2690.44 --> 2697.64
body of science about the forces the

2692.99 --> 2702.1
forces of nature gravity is kind of in

2697.64 --> 2704.39
there right but it's always been said

2702.1 --> 2707.15
still to this day

2704.39 --> 2707.72
gravity is a very weak force it's kind

2707.15 --> 2710.3
of weak

2707.72 --> 2711.7099999999996
it's yeah it does something but not a

2710.3 --> 2713.42
lot that's

2711.71 --> 2716.27
when you presume gravity is a force

2713.42 --> 2718.03
right okay so gravity is kind of weak

2716.27 --> 2722.78
force it does this slight push right

2718.03 --> 2725.6600000000003
well entropy which is also inherent to

2722.78 --> 2729.1090000000004
gas pressure expanding in the container

2725.66 --> 2732.319
that is force of entropy it's considered

2729.109 --> 2736.16
one of the strongest forces of nature so

2732.319 --> 2738.829
how is that weak force gravity presumed

2736.16 --> 2742.64
to be a force a weak force officially

2738.829 --> 2745.309
going to hole withholds the entropy

2742.64 --> 2750.2599999999998
expansion of the gas pressure it won't

2745.309 --> 2753.44
it won't really okay so let's take it to

2750.26 --> 2757.869
the next step because yeah there's more

2753.44 --> 2760.339
right let's presume that in some

2757.869 --> 2764.27
misunderstood miraculous science

2760.339 --> 2766.25
communication way gravity even though

2764.27 --> 2767.9
it's supposed to be a weak force but

2766.25 --> 2770.18
it's not actually force but let's just

2767.9 --> 2772.4900000000002
think that it is and assume that it is

2770.18 --> 2775.43
and that it is a weak force and that it

2772.49 --> 2777.1699999999996
can miraculously hold gas pressure to

2775.43 --> 2780.14
that ball opposing the outer space

2777.17 --> 2783.53
vacuum right let's say it's just like

2780.14 --> 2788.089
what okay it's yeah it can do that we

2783.53 --> 2791.75
don't know why but it can right there's

2788.089 --> 2798.64
another problem you see the outer space

2791.75 --> 2803.059
universe and fast cosmos the vacuum well

2798.64 --> 2804.77
it's expanding yeah they say to this day

2803.059 --> 2807.28
is redshift it's expanding the universe

2804.77 --> 2810.2599999999998
is expanding it's growing larger

2807.28 --> 2811.52
what does that mean what does that mean

2810.26 --> 2815.9
hmm

2811.52 --> 2820.25
it means that the volume of the

2815.9 --> 2823.25
container of the universe is growing the

2820.25 --> 2828.49
volume is increasing now there's this

2823.25 --> 2834.74
little weird thing we know about volume

2828.49 --> 2838.1499999999996
versus gas pressure that is well any

2834.74 --> 2840.589
kind of gradient any kind of relation

2838.15 --> 2842.9100000000003
division within the gases in a container

2840.589 --> 2847.57
if the container expand

2842.91 --> 2851.83
then uniformly all that gas pressure is

2847.57 --> 2854.38
gonna immediately also expand in a

2851.83 --> 2859.93
uniform way to kind of scale up to fill

2854.38 --> 2862.15
that container so even if gravity in its

2859.93 --> 2864.58
in its manifested in its supposed

2862.15 --> 2867.4
manifestation would be a weak force that

2864.58 --> 2869.65
could hold gas pressure to a bow the

2867.4 --> 2874.17
container of the universe is supposed to

2869.65 --> 2877.4700000000003
be expanding which would overtime at a

2874.17 --> 2881.23
constant rate counteract gravity's

2877.47 --> 2883.48
presupposed ability to miraculously hold

2881.23 --> 2888.97
the gas pressure to the container of the

2883.48 --> 2896.64
earth that's right there is no possible

2888.97 --> 2896.64
way in any conception of any kind ever

2898.95 --> 2904.6299999999997
that gas pressure can be held to the

2901.45 --> 2907.6189999999997
ball earth in the outer space universe

2904.63 --> 2907.619
ever

2909.29 --> 2912.4
[Music]

2913.39 --> 2916.5589999999997
so there you go

2918.74 --> 2924.0499999999997
it's a giant fractal of impossibilities

2921.74 --> 2929.9799999999996
no matter what you presuppose no matter

2924.05 --> 2929.98
what you pre suppose it's impossible

2934.19 --> 2937.3
[Music]

2940.32 --> 2942.98
[Music]

2941.83 --> 2947.15
yeah

2942.98 --> 2949.01
case closed indeed bkk days can't get

2947.15 --> 2951.349
more closed that doesn't matter what you

2949.01 --> 2954.5
allow them to presuppose it's impossible

2951.349 --> 2956.81
by all their mechanical standards with

2954.5 --> 2959.089
presupposition in all it's impossible it

2956.81 --> 2965.44
is one of the most impossible things

2959.089 --> 2965.44
ever conceptualized how insane is that

2968.35 --> 2971.54
[Music]

2988.93 --> 2997.8089999999997
it's Larry's it's hilarious isn't it

2994.049 --> 2999.549
like even as I'm talking I know what I'm

2997.809 --> 3001.92
talking about that's the funny thing I

2999.549 --> 3006.269
used to be such a freaking space

3001.92 --> 3010.65
UniFirst globe physics zealot in my own

3006.269 --> 3013.6499999999996
way I was very good I loved it yeah so I

3010.65 --> 3015.4500000000003
know these things and I now understand

3013.65 --> 3017.4900000000002
why it's so incredibly wrong and they're

3015.45 --> 3020.009
even as I explained all this the four

3017.49 --> 3021.3289999999997
steps I'm getting globish in here that

3020.009 --> 3022.95
are just saying yeah you're right

3021.329 --> 3024.7490000000003
because they've seen it they've heard

3022.95 --> 3027.96
that from people that they respect and

3024.749 --> 3030.359
have no reason not to for them but then

3027.96 --> 3034.589
when I actually draw the conclusion the

3030.359 --> 3038.67
consequences in there all this is

3034.589 --> 3043.769
something else oh yeah so above my head

3038.67 --> 3046.7400000000002
is just of the yes oh no this is way

3043.769 --> 3048.839
above my head or when this is not meant

3046.74 --> 3051.299
an integrating way because I like you oh

3048.839 --> 3054.779
thank you thank you so much Oh b12

3051.299 --> 3057.66
globey thank you so much I know it's so

3054.779 --> 3059.88
tough on you that when you know I'm

3057.66 --> 3063.239
actually right and then draw natural

3059.88 --> 3065.73
conclusions to the consequences of what

3063.239 --> 3067.589
you know I to be right in that you can't

3065.73 --> 3070.619
handle it and then you assert your

3067.589 --> 3073.369
inability to handle it on me you project

3070.619 --> 3076.259
it on me they know I can't handle it

3073.369 --> 3079.349
because they can't handle it and they

3076.259 --> 3081.599
don't proceed I do proceed I do actually

3079.349 --> 3084.869
draw the natural consequences of what

3081.599 --> 3086.7000000000003
they propose on every level and conclude

3084.869 --> 3089.9990000000003
that it is physically impossible and

3086.7 --> 3095.93
explain exactly why based on natural

3089.999 --> 3100.1899999999996
laws and assumptions about them so sorry

3095.93 --> 3100.19
I'm pretty sure I can handle it

3100.77 --> 3103.94
[Music]

3108.39 --> 3111.9089999999997
[Music]

3117.52 --> 3124.46
right it's something that's highly

3121.28 --> 3129.02
overlooked universally ironically enough

3124.46 --> 3132.14
universally that yeah if the universe

3129.02 --> 3136.52
supposed to be expanding that means that

3132.14 --> 3139.66
the gas pressure the vacuum it's

3136.52 --> 3142.07
decreasing it's getting worse

3139.66 --> 3144.08
presuming that all the gases can be held

3142.07 --> 3148.1600000000003
into into their places as they are

3144.08 --> 3150.47
supposedly it's still gonna all expand

3148.16 --> 3153.7999999999997
and thin out there's not new material

3150.47 --> 3156.6499999999996
introduced to account for the new volume

3153.8 --> 3159.86
coming out and nothing no it has to

3156.65 --> 3163.0
expand so the actual presupposed vacuum

3159.86 --> 3165.8
that is out there will get worse

3163.0 --> 3168.89
constantly over time the pressure the

3165.8 --> 3171.3500000000004
pressure must be decreasing if the

3168.89 --> 3173.99
universe is expanding and then they

3171.35 --> 3174.65
don't talk about this they never talk

3173.99 --> 3177.7999999999997
about this

3174.65 --> 3179.78
never never never they just let you keep

3177.8 --> 3181.46
stuck on that idea that gravity is all

3179.78 --> 3183.38
supposed to fix it it's also put it

3181.46 --> 3186.25
doesn't matter how bad the vacuum out

3183.38 --> 3188.75
there is it doesn't matter because

3186.25 --> 3192.47
gravity will fix it all that's what they

3188.75 --> 3195.08
tell you well no doesn't and I explain

3192.47 --> 3197.7799999999997
exactly why on four levels of

3195.08 --> 3203.5
presupposition so good luck with that

3197.78 --> 3206.17
and feel free to clip everything I said

3203.5 --> 3209.0
use it as an example

3206.17 --> 3214.03
I'm absolutely green lighting that for

3209.0 --> 3214.03
anyone just don't take it out of context

3215.77 --> 3218.34
yeah

3232.46 --> 3236.7400000000002
that's ridiculous Jeffrey Borg

3240.33 --> 3246.45
like just because they and I don't think

3243.51 --> 3250.0200000000004
they'd that this is even relevant just

3246.45 --> 3251.43
saying something out of your ass even if

3250.02 --> 3252.75
they didn't believe satellite didn't

3251.43 --> 3257.0099999999998
exist that doesn't mean that there

3252.75 --> 3260.31
wouldn't be spy planes been around for a

3257.01 --> 3264.21
long time doesn't mean there can be

3260.31 --> 3270.08
statins there's still a bill yeah I

3264.21 --> 3273.21
abilities to have satellite like spy

3270.08 --> 3276.41
devices out there so it's just

3273.21 --> 3276.41
completely superfluous

3286.589 --> 3295.96
KGB is real yeah funny is it

3291.66 --> 3298.0
sure GPS is real even though the G is

3295.96 --> 3300.67
highly misplaced it's just a

3298.0 --> 3303.73
triangulation system based on towers and

3300.67 --> 3307.39
maybe a couple of balloon relays works

3303.73 --> 3311.79
fine you don't need some weird thing

3307.39 --> 3311.79
floating in presupposed high orbit

3330.44 --> 3345.53
right KPS existed before the Sapta loons

3335.559 --> 3348.44
what doesn't call again the name eludes

3345.53 --> 3351.3190000000004
me the towers the towers that were used

3348.44 --> 3359.66
before supposed satellites were

3351.319 --> 3363.47
introduced Lauren that's right Thank You

3359.66 --> 3365.24
Jeffery bill the Lorenz system yeah

3363.47 --> 3367.25
and that was there there were no

3365.24 --> 3369.319
satellites they use that that

3367.25 --> 3375.609
transatlantic communications with that

3369.319 --> 3378.609
so yeah don't need no satellites for

3375.609 --> 3378.609
communication

3399.35 --> 3403.97
right

3400.53 --> 3403.9700000000003
and there's the underwater cables

3422.46 --> 3431.73
yeah jeffra Bork your [ __ ] get out of

3426.119 --> 3435.359
here dumbass you're an idiot

3431.73 --> 3438.51
just because there's no GPS in Iraq how

3435.359 --> 3440.0099999999998
does that that doesn't make any sense if

3438.51 --> 3442.7400000000002
there's just satellites flowing over

3440.01 --> 3445.53
then why would it not be available in

3442.74 --> 3448.109
Iraq unless there was no tower reach I

3445.53 --> 3449.94
was closed off doesn't make any damn

3448.109 --> 3452.119
sense you're just asserting your

3449.94 --> 3455.78
[ __ ] nonsense here

3452.119 --> 3477.75
your satellite belief convictions

3455.78 --> 3479.94
nonsense yeah well satellites are a

3477.75 --> 3483.54
great science-fiction tool you know I

3479.94 --> 3486.4700000000003
always am fond of the idea of satellites

3483.54 --> 3489.8089999999997
in Star Trek you know they're fun

3486.47 --> 3493.5589999999997
concepts but in the real world that

3489.809 --> 3497.13
doesn't exist just to clear that up but

3493.559 --> 3504.0
it's a cool little science fiction

3497.13 --> 3505.8900000000003
invention it's a neat idea it's not real

3504.0 --> 3508.079
though because there is no orbits there

3505.89 --> 3510.48
is no higher orbit there is no place

3508.079 --> 3516.599
where the the presupposed gravity

3510.48 --> 3519.9900000000002
decreases there's no point in the realm

3516.599 --> 3524.2200000000003
in the actual realm where we are in the

3519.99 --> 3526.319
container that I suspect because I

3524.22 --> 3528.39
haven't absolutely confirmed it yet but

3526.319 --> 3533.18
just doesn't seem to be any hint of it

3528.39 --> 3536.64
that the relative density displacements

3533.18 --> 3542.72
alter in their alignment or in their

3536.64 --> 3542.72
strength it doesn't the relative density

3542.9 --> 3550.2000000000003
displacement versus differential balance

3546.39 --> 3555.299
seems to be pretty consistent as far as

3550.2 --> 3555.8399999999997
I can tell so yeah no gravity or no lack

3555.299 --> 3558.42
of

3555.84 --> 3563.9700000000003
density displacement not that I've seen

3558.42 --> 3565.32
any hint off so far so yeah there may be

3563.97 --> 3567.33
things up there but it's going to be

3565.32 --> 3571.7000000000003
because they're density is extremely low

3567.33 --> 3571.7
like balloons but that's it

3572.45 --> 3578.3999999999996
anything else you send up there yeah you

3574.77 --> 3580.65
may propel it force it higher through

3578.4 --> 3589.23
momentum that's nothing on the last very

3580.65 --> 3591.4500000000003
long unless there's something that could

3589.23 --> 3594.21
technologically be done to bypass

3591.45 --> 3596.8199999999997
relative density and for example through

3594.21 --> 3601.28
some kind of polarization enables matter

3596.82 --> 3604.71
to be lighter than hydrogen for example

3601.28 --> 3606.51
effectively lower density effectively

3604.71 --> 3611.43
through some electrostatics I don't know

3606.51 --> 3615.09
maybe that is a way but other than that

3611.43 --> 3618.12
there's just there is no point where

3615.09 --> 3624.3900000000003
things just by themselves start to float

3618.12 --> 3626.7
and not descend if they are solid

3624.39 --> 3630.8399999999997
objects if they are heavier than the

3626.7 --> 3634.22
density of the super thin gases at the

3630.84 --> 3634.2200000000003
higher regions of the container

3647.99 --> 3655.769
yeah maybe Philip Cooper why are you

3653.73 --> 3658.619
caps questioning that [ __ ]

3655.769 --> 3662.1899999999996
why are you demanding that I know it is

3658.619 --> 3663.9300000000003
it because you're so used to your

3662.19 --> 3665.789
priesthood telling you they know

3663.93 --> 3669.18
freaking everything and that they always

3665.789 --> 3671.88
have some answer to everything which

3669.18 --> 3674.7889999999998
usually is comprised of just asserting

3671.88 --> 3676.859
nonsense stories that you are fooled

3674.789 --> 3679.0490000000004
into believing without actually getting

3676.859 --> 3680.5789999999997
empirical evidence for it or reasoning

3679.049 --> 3682.079
out how that is supposed to work for

3680.579 --> 3686.4300000000003
real no you just listen to their

3682.079 --> 3688.079
freaking stories like a zealot right I

3686.43 --> 3692.0989999999997
don't know where the walls of the

3688.079 --> 3695.13
container are and at least I'm honest

3692.099 --> 3697.319
about it and I'm not dumb enough to

3695.13 --> 3699.4500000000003
think that just because I don't know

3697.319 --> 3702.63
something that that means it's all

3699.45 --> 3704.519
invalid office that means so that you

3702.63 --> 3707.059
can assert your freaking ball religion

3704.519 --> 3707.0589999999997
again No

3734.64 --> 3738.8399999999997
[Music]

3739.66 --> 3743.72
yeah Matthew lingard nothing is orbiting

3743.15 --> 3747.349
the Earth

3743.72 --> 3749.589
there is no orbiting physical objects

3747.349 --> 3752.69
cannot orbit the Earth

3749.589 --> 3757.099
they cannot float up there unless they

3752.69 --> 3761.329
have very low density they will heavier

3757.099 --> 3763.73
objects without a huge amount of gas to

3761.329 --> 3767.3900000000003
offset the relative density average are

3763.73 --> 3770.03
not going to be hanging up there it's

3767.39 --> 3773.1189999999997
impossible so whatever you're seeing out

3770.03 --> 3776.03
there it's lights I don't know how that

3773.119 --> 3778.67
works what they're doing it's probably

3776.03 --> 3780.7400000000002
artificial in some way but maybe it

3778.67 --> 3782.27
isn't even I don't know I said just

3780.74 --> 3785.39
don't know at this point but what I do

3782.27 --> 3789.67
know is nothing orbits the earth because

3785.39 --> 3789.67
orbiting is a fictional concept

3794.58 --> 3805.02
I think Newton kind of invented it as a

3798.93 --> 3807.1499999999996
fiction gravitation thing he wasn't he

3805.02 --> 3809.79
the one that originally asserted that if

3807.15 --> 3815.94
you shoot a cannonball hard enough it

3809.79 --> 3818.04
would go around the earth was he wasn't

3815.94 --> 3821.25
he the one that that thought that up

3818.04 --> 3823.2599999999998
originally anyway even if he wasn't I'm

3821.25 --> 3828.14
pretty sure he didn't claim hypotheses

3823.26 --> 3828.1400000000003
for gravitation specifically noted so

3872.25 --> 3877.369
[Music]

3874.73 --> 3879.859
yeah look if you're a global and you

3877.369 --> 3884.48
want to somehow inquire or defend or

3879.859 --> 3886.339
tell us why why you still think it's a

3884.48 --> 3888.349
curve there well that's that's nice but

3886.339 --> 3891.68
if you're gonna be some kind of stupid

3888.349 --> 3894.349
sock account right and you're gonna say

3891.68 --> 3898.46
something as absolutely [ __ ] as

3894.349 --> 3902.96
saying that some water droplet on your

3898.46 --> 3905.69
desk that is subjected to surface

3902.96 --> 3907.25
tension right drawing it into that that

3905.69 --> 3909.9500000000003
kind of spherical shape because of the

3907.25 --> 3912.829
small-scale nature of water right that

3909.95 --> 3915.3489999999997
that is supposedly proof yeah you're

3912.829 --> 3922.27
gonna be banned that is so dumb that's

3915.349 --> 3922.27
an intolerable that is to go away

3935.259 --> 3943.089
yeah it's nothing more intolerable to

3938.15 --> 3943.089
Liars than flat earth that's right

3966.9 --> 3969.56
yeah

3973.26 --> 3979.8300000000004
yeah maybe Juran up Tao the issue is I

3977.49 --> 3981.6299999999997
don't know who's a baller and a whiz and

3979.83 --> 3984.66
at this point and if a baller would say

3981.63 --> 3988.29
that that's just freaking annoying

3984.66 --> 3995.7
anyway I time them out it's just that

3988.29 --> 4002.09
you don't need to make baller jokes like

3995.7 --> 4004.31
don't be a gamma for them okay we don't

4002.09 --> 4013.13
need that kind of sarcastic example it's

4004.31 --> 4016.73
just confusing you know if you do it on

4013.13 --> 4018.8
camera or with voice it's much easier to

4016.73 --> 4024.13
determine when something is meant as a

4018.8 --> 4024.13
joke in chat I did just kind of tough

4026.98 --> 4036.17
because it was really stupid to say that

4031.55 --> 4041.9500000000003
obi-wan do glowy and besides he had an

4036.17 --> 4041.9500000000003
obvious troll sock account name to me

4047.39 --> 4052.95
so yeah there's some trolls out there

4050.19 --> 4055.89
that are just the only thing that they

4052.95 --> 4059.0099999999998
really want to do is somehow stop me but

4055.89 --> 4062.27
since they can't break down my arguments

4059.01 --> 4067.3500000000004
because I'm like 20 levels above them

4062.27 --> 4069.33
when it comes to technicals right so far

4067.35 --> 4073.16
beyond them the only thing that they can

4069.33 --> 4078.359
do really is just try to dumb down the

4073.16 --> 4081.0299999999997
output have very dumb basic things in

4078.359 --> 4084.99
place for people to get distracted by

4081.03 --> 4087.6000000000004
and then fall back into the into the

4084.99 --> 4090.0899999999997
minimum so that's what they got left and

4087.6 --> 4091.44
when I see that I just ban it now if

4090.09 --> 4095.01
you're going to be that stupid you're

4091.44 --> 4096.509
doing it only either because you have no

4095.01 --> 4099.63
place here because you would be too

4096.509 --> 4101.7
freakin dumb to yet along or understand

4099.63 --> 4104.339
anything of what I'm saying or you're

4101.7 --> 4107.19
literally here too dumb to try to

4104.339 --> 4110.79
attempt to a dumb everyone down and I'm

4107.19 --> 4112.94
not tolerating that [ __ ] anymore just so

4110.79 --> 4112.94
you know

4123.399 --> 4126.728
[Music]

4126.82 --> 4138.349999999999
okay no no no being a gamma smartass

4134.15 --> 4141.469999999999
will get you banned not arguments a

4138.35 --> 4143.51
freaking water droplet surface tension

4141.47 --> 4146.2
is not proof of a kerf and anybody who

4143.51 --> 4149.77
asserts that or defense that is banned

4146.2 --> 4149.7699999999995
because you're a dumbass

4157.6 --> 4166.679
[Music]

4169.45 --> 4173.01
[Music]

4180.85 --> 4188.4400000000005
my high is great what you mean I what

4184.54 --> 4192.25
paper do I have what kind of paper

4188.44 --> 4192.79
oh it's barely anything really I got

4192.25 --> 4197.19
nothing

4192.79 --> 4200.29
almost nothing what I do have however is

4197.19 --> 4208.379999999999
fanatical dedication from two opposing

4200.29 --> 4213.88
sides for 25-30 years that's what I got

4208.38 --> 4217.39
and that is worth a thousand shitty

4213.88 --> 4218.95
little university papers that are

4217.39 --> 4220.63
worthless to people because they were

4218.95 --> 4224.16
never taught what the hell they were

4220.63 --> 4224.16
even learning okay

4246.8 --> 4253.1900000000005
yeah there's a lot of shitty people in

4248.749 --> 4255.559
this court I know there's some real

4253.19 --> 4257.509999999999
demon hives out there in this court

4255.559 --> 4260.7390000000005
that's what made me avoid it like the

4257.51 --> 4260.7390000000005
plague in the first place

4285.84 --> 4291.2
yeah

4287.76 --> 4294.27
no no I don't have a lot of papers I

4291.2 --> 4296.13
have what is it don't know it's slightly

4294.27 --> 4299.040000000001
different everywhere but I have a middle

4296.13 --> 4306.75
school finished middle school with a

4299.04 --> 4310.23
diploma and on physics math like is it

4306.75 --> 4319.47
math B so not statistics but mechanical

4310.23 --> 4322.04
math English Dutch art and biology and I

4319.47 --> 4322.04
did very well

4342.13 --> 4349.75
like my best class was English by far my

4346.119 --> 4352.589999999999
highest score on that but I did pretty

4349.75 --> 4352.59
well in physics

4361.159 --> 4366.489
I should try to find my scores back I

4363.949 --> 4369.969
don't even remember what they were

4366.489 --> 4369.968999999999
not exactly

4374.409 --> 4382.21
all right yeah well I look I did try to

4378.76 --> 4387.04
go to study but the problem was I never

4382.21 --> 4391.06
really knew what I wanted so I tried to

4387.04 --> 4394.69
go into this weird computer game

4391.06 --> 4398.17
oriented study but like an arts thing

4394.69 --> 4402.0
but they they didn't allow me in twice

4398.17 --> 4404.08
even though I had like made things

4402.0 --> 4405.94
specifically for they just didn't want

4404.08 --> 4408.57
me and I I think I know why because they

4405.94 --> 4410.98
were freaking social justice warriors I

4408.57 --> 4413.409
didn't know it back then I was still

4410.98 --> 4417.61
like I'm just innocent

4413.409 --> 4420.58
I just inspired but I didn't get in

4417.61 --> 4422.92
there I tried other things I tried media

4420.58 --> 4426.63
technology just like a general thing

4422.92 --> 4436.9
with computers that didn't work out I

4426.63 --> 4439.659000000001
tried going into was it sort of a nurse

4436.9 --> 4442.989
Direction thing that didn't work out

4439.659 --> 4445.69
turned out to be quite horrific so

4442.989 --> 4447.669999999999
thought like this is not what I wanted

4445.69 --> 4450.46
to do that for so I stepped away from

4447.67 --> 4453.28
that as well and then eventually I did

4450.46 --> 4456.69
goldsmithing it took a long time before

4453.28 --> 4461.83
I got there I only started it in 2005

4456.69 --> 4463.449
and then like my mother died and got

4461.83 --> 4469.48
very stressed out took a little bit

4463.449 --> 4473.589999999999
longer to redo the year and yeah I did

4469.48 --> 4475.69
get pretty far I think but I also quit

4473.59 --> 4477.67
that and never got any official thing

4475.69 --> 4479.23
but you don't need to in order to start

4477.67 --> 4482.29
a company that's what I figured out and

4479.23 --> 4486.659
I completely couldn't stand a lot of the

4482.29 --> 4490.03
teachers there that seemed to be just

4486.659 --> 4491.7699999999995
just trying to suppress me and make me

4490.03 --> 4494.98
do things that I didn't want to do and

4491.77 --> 4498.159000000001
try to humiliate me so I I left and yeah

4494.98 --> 4502.54
I got some college debt from that but

4498.159 --> 4504.83
also thanks to my mother's yeah

4502.54 --> 4506.69
thanks to big no because she died I

4504.83 --> 4510.469
suddenly did get a lot of money from

4506.69 --> 4512.33
inheritance from the house and so I

4510.469 --> 4514.88
immediately just squared away the

4512.33 --> 4516.8
college debt all of it that I had it was

4514.88 --> 4520.42
a good move I'm glad I did a don't have

4516.8 --> 4520.42
it anymore I did have some of it

4590.5 --> 4605.28
what are you talking about be right back

4701.5 --> 4710.57
hmm no is it me or is it slightly

4705.98 --> 4721.509999999999
lighter now weird they're more light

4710.57 --> 4721.509999999999
right now so it's just me hmm

4723.46 --> 4728.9800000000005
like this is kind of what it seems like

4725.83 --> 4734.34
to my eyes like this if I move it up it

4728.98 --> 4734.339999999999
gets me more gray I know

4734.6 --> 4737.709000000001
[Music]

4737.97 --> 4743.9400000000005
yeah maybe less clouds but it's hard to

4740.41 --> 4743.94
tell because it's all cloud

4759.09 --> 4766.02
the crew I always hang around I haven't

4763.59 --> 4769.76
seen him yet this morning but yesterday

4766.02 --> 4769.76
he was all over the roof so

4771.62 --> 4774.8189999999995
[Music]

4779.969 --> 4784.88
okay Philip Cooper you might want to

4782.4 --> 4784.879999999999
stop that

4819.2 --> 4825.9
it's not your job to go caps hm it's

4823.65 --> 4827.42
actually a timeout of offense if you

4825.9 --> 4830.28
persist with that

4827.42 --> 4845.12
so yeah warning to you Philip Cooper

4830.28 --> 4848.63
stop it good all right obi-wan do globey

4845.12 --> 4848.63
you're welcome

4857.9 --> 4861.799999999999
space comas what

4871.78 --> 4874.969999999999
[Music]

4880.42 --> 4883.65
what does that mean

4916.02 --> 4921.360000000001
all right me too jarred Sanford I think

4918.75 --> 4924.66
we've been asking that even in the

4921.36 --> 4929.25
debates and I think marks our didn't

4924.66 --> 4931.98
even join us on that early on was this

4929.25 --> 4935.48
thing that could have been organized

4931.98 --> 4939.2699999999995
where I'm Scott Fitch kind of would

4935.48 --> 4941.429999999999
presumably do that but it never got off

4939.27 --> 4946.2300000000005
the ground so we even talked about that

4941.43 --> 4950.16
like a year ago or two years ago yeah

4946.23 --> 4953.129999999999
like why don't why doesn't asset

4950.16 --> 4955.68
actually does a live test with their

4953.13 --> 4959.1
spacesuits in their vacuum chamber since

4955.68 --> 4965.820000000001
they do have it well we all do know why

4959.1 --> 4970.26
they don't do it but yeah because it

4965.82 --> 4972.179999999999
would absolutely ruin the whole set up

4970.26 --> 4973.83
the whole presuppositional set up who

4972.18 --> 4976.650000000001
would immediately show that everything

4973.83 --> 4979.91
they they did with that presuming a

4976.65 --> 4979.91
vacuum is just complete nonsense

4991.949 --> 4999.379999999999
oh okay I didn't know that that is very

4996.54 --> 5006.44
annoying John doll but it's just bad

4999.38 --> 5008.6
yeah bad writing sucks I have some weird

5006.44 --> 5011.0
handwriting habits myself I kind of took

5008.6 --> 5012.9490000000005
it on from the from the German language

5011.0 --> 5016.9
where they seem to do this more by

5012.949 --> 5023.41
default that is use caps letters to

5016.9 --> 5023.41
emphasize words of importance

5028.8 --> 5038.58
what is it the Germans do it ah I'm not

5034.05 --> 5041.1900000000005
too good at describing word mechanic

5038.58 --> 5043.11
like this grammar mechanics in English

5041.19 --> 5046.53
that don't know all the words but it is

5043.11 --> 5049.889999999999
like the the words that are things those

5046.53 --> 5052.71
have capital letters in German so uh but

5049.89 --> 5054.84
it it kind of helps a bit makes it much

5052.71 --> 5059.16
clearer as to what you're writing what

5054.84 --> 5061.74
you're reading easier quicker so I have

5059.16 --> 5065.24
a bit of a habit sometimes doing that

5061.74 --> 5065.24
slightly in my own way

5080.28 --> 5088.75
no it doesn't Matthew lingard oh my god

5085.56 --> 5090.9890000000005
GPS does not mean Global Positioning

5088.75 --> 5093.699
satellites

5090.989 --> 5096.879999999999
it's just desperate it means Global

5093.699 --> 5098.83
Positioning System just be glad they

5096.88 --> 5102.33
eBay inserted your freaking globe in

5098.83 --> 5106.739
there okay don't get satellites

5102.33 --> 5106.739
seriously that's just desperate man

5111.36 --> 5115.41
think you're a bit deluded

5132.929 --> 5138.6900000000005
a really Matthew lingard show us one

5135.78 --> 5140.429
show us one active not on the ground

5138.69 --> 5144.98
because we know those things get built

5140.429 --> 5149.27
yeah we know show it show an actual

5144.98 --> 5153.8099999999995
photograph of a satellite in orbit

5149.27 --> 5159.360000000001
present a photo graph of a satellite in

5153.81 --> 5162.620000000001
orbit okay photo graph of a satellite in

5159.36 --> 5167.159
orbit a photograph not an image

5162.62 --> 5169.699
photograph but you go find one Matthew

5167.159 --> 5169.699
lingard

5182.999 --> 5189.69
oh yeah you can watch it well why don't

5185.13 --> 5192.059
you show me why don't you show me the

5189.69 --> 5194.28
actual physical structure of that

5192.059 --> 5198.599
satellite not not a wandering star

5194.28 --> 5202.259999999999
another is the because those been around

5198.599 --> 5204.869000000001
for a long time like there's the

5202.26 --> 5206.46
planetary wandering stars and then

5204.869 --> 5210.119
there's just these weird quick moving

5206.46 --> 5211.979
lights they've been around forever they

5210.119 --> 5214.518999999999
almost seem like a plane sometimes it's

5211.979 --> 5218.519
not like a falling star you know what

5214.519 --> 5220.619000000001
that kind of makes me think maybe it's

5218.519 --> 5223.889
all just a bunch of layers of quick

5220.619 --> 5226.768999999999
movement there's just the stars that are

5223.889 --> 5232.86
in place then you got the planets the

5226.769 --> 5236.429
slower of grey' of That star grid slower

5232.86 --> 5239.219
moving things then you have the weird

5236.429 --> 5242.4
phenomena of the kind of slow moving but

5239.219 --> 5246.659
still visibly trackable lights and then

5242.4 --> 5251.549999999999
you have falling stars kind of makes you

5246.659 --> 5256.228999999999
think it's all motions all motion based

5251.55 --> 5261.360000000001
and on different speeds isn't that kind

5256.229 --> 5264.059
of interesting but yeah yeah there is

5261.36 --> 5265.86
these lights that just hope that are not

5264.059 --> 5273.38
planes that's true I've seen that myself

5265.86 --> 5273.38
ah channeling his band now

5279.89 --> 5283.079000000001
[Music]

5285.23 --> 5289.509999999999
[Music]

5295.899 --> 5301.309
yeah I know they I know they have a

5298.809 --> 5303.409000000001
supposed schedule and you could check

5301.309 --> 5306.1990000000005
them out time a time that's really nice

5303.409 --> 5307.969
you can look it up on the computer where

5306.199 --> 5309.949
they tell you it's supposed to be is

5307.969 --> 5314.26
really cool yeah

5309.949 --> 5317.478999999999
have you actually seen the actual

5314.26 --> 5322.219
contours of a satellite in supposed

5317.479 --> 5324.919
orbit or a photograph or it's the

5322.219 --> 5327.7390000000005
photograph with the photograph of the

5324.919 --> 5331.189
satellite in orbit that actual physical

5327.739 --> 5334.308999999999
structure of the satellite in orbit and

5331.189 --> 5336.319
not some weird sphere or whatever

5334.309 --> 5338.119000000001
there's weird metal spheres going about

5336.319 --> 5341.049
as well it's just a lot of freaking

5338.119 --> 5342.199
weird stuff up there like really weird

5341.049 --> 5345.139
okay

5342.199 --> 5347.659
so that's just some stupid sphere know

5345.139 --> 5350.479
the actual satellite you know you know

5347.659 --> 5352.549
like a freaking box the bunch of cameras

5350.479 --> 5355.399
and then the solar panels at satellite

5352.549 --> 5359.299
okay a satellite as they say what they

5355.399 --> 5364.279
send up in space right so show me that

5359.299 --> 5370.519
thing floating up there with a photo

5364.279 --> 5372.9490000000005
graph okay it's too high we can't do

5370.519 --> 5380.269
it's just all the complications it's too

5372.949 --> 5382.759999999999
far with no [ __ ] okay if you got a

5380.269 --> 5385.069
freaking telescope that can see in the

5382.76 --> 5388.279
other side of the universe you can get a

5385.069 --> 5391.959000000001
freakin photo graph of a satellite in

5388.279 --> 5391.959000000001
orbit [ __ ]

5402.739 --> 5408.98
- sighs could you as you reflect you

5406.34 --> 5410.54
know did we see a reflection no I don't

5408.98 --> 5413.239
want to see lights I don't want to see

5410.54 --> 5418.33
glitters I don't want to see something I

5413.239 --> 5422.179999999999
want to see a photo graph of an

5418.33 --> 5427.18
identifiable reliable structure presumed

5422.18 --> 5430.700000000001
to be a satellite in orbit a photograph

5427.18 --> 5435.85
where it can be clearly identified and

5430.7 --> 5445.489
relayed to a thing that was made here

5435.85 --> 5452.84
okay yeah you're out here [ __ ] it's the

5445.489 --> 5454.968999999999
last time yeah I guess I need to route

5452.84 --> 5458.21
out some ballers because they're just

5454.969 --> 5460.7300000000005
burrowing in waiting to be triggered and

5458.21 --> 5463.31
now it's trigger time it's a trigger

5460.73 --> 5465.98
time because I'm gonna push the shove

5463.31 --> 5468.14
the real issues you got and if you're

5465.98 --> 5471.11
gonna have your little gamma moment you

5468.14 --> 5473.51
see we spiraling it's like yeah bent I

5471.11 --> 5475.759999999999
know you hang around in my chat for over

5473.51 --> 5479.4800000000005
half a year I know you're even halfway

5475.76 --> 5491.030000000001
decent but you still had to do it didn't

5479.48 --> 5498.259999999999
yet Philip Cooper I didn't ask for some

5491.03 --> 5500.929999999999
freaking assertion and Vaart God I don't

5498.26 --> 5504.89
want to know about what freaking GPS is

5500.93 --> 5511.16
supposed to be you idiot I want a photo

5504.89 --> 5515.900000000001
graph of a satellite in orbit so don't

5511.16 --> 5516.62
assert your crappy beliefs what you were

5515.9 --> 5520.54
told

5516.62 --> 5525.4
I want the photograph of the

5520.54 --> 5529.37
identifiable on earth having been seen

5525.4 --> 5533.98
satellite up there identifiable a

5529.37 --> 5533.98
photograph not an image a photograph

5534.229 --> 5546.079000000001
yeah I know cami yeah I mean they only

5543.05 --> 5549.909000000001
had five years to respond to this [ __ ]

5546.079 --> 5552.44
to shove that down our throats but no no

5549.909 --> 5555.44
but it must be out there right yeah just

5552.44 --> 5557.659
just rely on the stories they tell you

5555.44 --> 5560.478999999999
about it don't actually get the

5557.659 --> 5564.829
photograph and actually find that proof

5560.479 --> 5566.780000000001
or well maybe you don't want to spend

5564.829 --> 5568.61
half your life and trying to desperately

5566.78 --> 5569.929
get that proof that doesn't exist

5568.61 --> 5573.249
because it can't exist

5569.929 --> 5578.889
can't exist because there is no orbit

5573.249 --> 5584.3
things cannot float up there without

5578.889 --> 5587.209
some body of gas to offset the relative

5584.3 --> 5590.570000000001
density in order for it to be able to

5587.209 --> 5597.289
stay up there because there is no escape

5590.57 --> 5600.65
from presumed gravity because there is

5597.289 --> 5604.459
no gravity doesn't decrease the relative

5600.65 --> 5607.759999999999
density displacement doesn't decrease

5604.459 --> 5610.459
the differential of the displacement the

5607.76 --> 5614.349
relation between an object's density and

5610.459 --> 5617.179
its medium does not change with height

5614.349 --> 5620.349
it does not there is no proof of this

5617.179 --> 5620.349
not even close

5654.469 --> 5660.949
Oh welfare Cooper hey if you have a how

5659.12 --> 5665.989
about a set light visible to the naked

5660.949 --> 5669.29
eye look just go outside the sky vacuum

5665.989 --> 5671.419999999999
it's right there I just look well if you

5669.29 --> 5674.42
can really see it hey if you can walk

5671.42 --> 5676.82
outside and see that freaking satellite

5674.42 --> 5681.71
with your naked eye why don't you take a

5676.82 --> 5683.389999999999
photograph of it feel it Cooper if you

5681.71 --> 5687.5
can really see that with your naked eye

5683.39 --> 5691.910000000001
why don't you take a photo graph of it

5687.5 --> 5696.739
Philip Cooper go ahead why didn't you do

5691.91 --> 5698.84
that alright don't have to equipment you

5696.739 --> 5700.91
don't have to equipment well I'll bet

5698.84 --> 5703.360000000001
you'll be able to borrow some from one

5700.91 --> 5706.66
of your baller colleagues or whatever

5703.36 --> 5709.299999999999
right your university or whatever you do

5706.66 --> 5713.96
once you get a photograph of that

5709.3 --> 5715.28
satellite in orbit if it is so easy for

5713.96 --> 5716.81
people to just see it with their eyes

5715.28 --> 5718.489
well if you can see it with your eyes

5716.81 --> 5722.9890000000005
you can damn well make a photograph of

5718.489 --> 5726.61
it now can you they're not talking about

5722.989 --> 5726.61
images though I don't want a photograph

5732.349 --> 5737.150000000001
hey Fiona James hey if I'm ever gonna

5735.78 --> 5740.119
see some weird

5737.15 --> 5743.5199999999995
unidentified light phenomena in the sky

5740.119 --> 5745.949
that's like really off well well I will

5743.52 --> 5749.6990000000005
be damned well inclined to get the

5745.949 --> 5753.0199999999995
camera my camera it's my camera I got it

5749.699 --> 5756.119
it's not a Randy cam it's my camera

5753.02 --> 5758.88
Randy has no more say over what happens

5756.119 --> 5764.46
with that thing ever again okay so you

5758.88 --> 5767.28
can drop that but I will if I see

5764.46 --> 5770.04
something interesting I will get my

5767.28 --> 5772.829
camera out and take some live footage

5770.04 --> 5774.21
even maybe a photograph but especially

5772.829 --> 5775.92
live footage because that's even more

5774.21 --> 5781.139
interesting of course if it's a moving

5775.92 --> 5783.0
phenomena yeah I do that I'd love to I'm

5781.139 --> 5785.909000000001
interested in interesting phenomena I'm

5783.0 --> 5788.219
interested in orbs in weird things

5785.909 --> 5791.219
because I do believe there is a lot of

5788.219 --> 5793.02
freaking weird stuff out there but

5791.219 --> 5795.78
there's no satellites I've never seen a

5793.02 --> 5798.389
satellite seen light things but have

5795.78 --> 5802.079
never seen like identifiable confirmable

5798.389 --> 5805.409000000001
typical physical objects because hey

5802.079 --> 5808.59
planes I up there they're very well

5805.409 --> 5812.04
they're easy to distinguish as actual

5808.59 --> 5817.9490000000005
real physical objects as the light and

5812.04 --> 5820.05
all that relays so there's no reason why

5817.949 --> 5824.638999999999
in a night sky when there's for example

5820.05 --> 5827.46
a moon out why you would not be able to

5824.639 --> 5832.409000000001
identify physical features of a

5827.46 --> 5834.949
satellite if you can see with your naked

5832.409 --> 5834.949
eye

5866.089 --> 5874.579
yeah Matthew lingard don't try to assert

5869.03 --> 5878.268999999999
your wacky ball physics on real-world

5874.579 --> 5880.219
things that we talked about don't do

5878.269 --> 5891.8
that with Karen B that's just ridiculous

5880.219 --> 5893.629
oh really do enough now or so then you

5891.8 --> 5896.209
can't see it with your physical you can

5893.629 --> 5899.3589999999995
see a light thingy and then you just

5896.209 --> 5904.188999999999
assume it's satellites because that was

5899.359 --> 5908.149
told to you I remember that was told to

5904.189 --> 5910.4490000000005
me too I remember never seen the

5908.149 --> 5914.389
physical features of any of it though

5910.449 --> 5919.0689999999995
only the images from space that NASA

5914.389 --> 5923.709
gives us some of them very blatantly

5919.069 --> 5926.709000000001
obviously 3d rendered images not a

5923.709 --> 5926.709
picture

5930.45 --> 5933.889999999999
the oldest speed tells you it's a

5932.55 --> 5938.91
satellite Wow

5933.89 --> 5942.51
so the speed the speed matches up with a

5938.91 --> 5946.099999999999
presumed calculation that was told to

5942.51 --> 5948.21
you is the mechanic as part of this

5946.1 --> 5949.83
satellite thing that's supposed to be

5948.21 --> 5951.39
out there so you see some light out

5949.83 --> 5952.7699999999995
there it has the speed it kind of

5951.39 --> 5955.29
correlates with the story that was told

5952.77 --> 5960.8
you and that is sufficient evidence to

5955.29 --> 5960.8
you that satellites are real how sad

5988.84 --> 5993.610000000001
nope can't be yeah but that's the whole

5990.79 --> 5994.89
thing you know there's so much stories

5993.61 --> 5997.389999999999
to tell

5994.89 --> 6001.05
ballers can spend all that time just

5997.39 --> 6003.450000000001
asserting their information and it'll be

6001.05 --> 6005.610000000001
good enough to distract everyone away

6003.45 --> 6008.94
from the fact that it's all [ __ ]

6005.61 --> 6011.07
it'll distract them away from the fact

6008.94 --> 6015.99
that their beliefs are all [ __ ] at

6011.07 --> 6018.0599999999995
least maybe not us but that angle of

6015.99 --> 6020.3099999999995
approach that they have will kind of rub

6018.06 --> 6023.1900000000005
off on other people that feel the same

6020.31 --> 6027.2300000000005
way and also wish to defend their

6023.19 --> 6027.23
delusions that's how it works

6037.69 --> 6042.759999999999
cool well why don't you show me a

6039.82 --> 6045.25
photograph or a better moving footage

6042.76 --> 6048.91
right if it's so super visible why don't

6045.25 --> 6051.52
you show some actual physical features

6048.91 --> 6052.84
if there's a light apparition I'll be

6051.52 --> 6055.21
able to see that as well

6052.84 --> 6064.03
you can't just assert that certain

6055.21 --> 6070.9
lights would be that I want to see some

6064.03 --> 6073.48
real yeah some look this if the ISS is

6070.9 --> 6077.98
really transversing this world very

6073.48 --> 6080.83
rapidly and you get to see the supposed

6077.98 --> 6085.03
daylight side right that means that the

6080.83 --> 6087.73
ISS should be visible during daylight so

6085.03 --> 6089.259999999999
why don't you show me that if it's out

6087.73 --> 6093.04
there in the daylight there's gonna be

6089.26 --> 6096.12
some reflecting off hitting that it

6093.04 --> 6099.07
should be well visible like a bit like a

6096.12 --> 6101.01
like an airplane can shine off some

6099.07 --> 6103.33
light even though it's almost invisible

6101.01 --> 6105.7
so where is that where is that daily

6103.33 --> 6108.19
event where we see the reflections of

6105.7 --> 6110.5599999999995
the ISS during from the Sun during

6108.19 --> 6115.57
daytime where is that I've never seen

6110.56 --> 6119.820000000001
that oh it's oh oh yeah being banned is

6115.57 --> 6119.82
not a good look on you to philip cooper

6127.5 --> 6134.08
anymore they're all just asking to get

6132.94 --> 6137.0199999999995
banned because they got no more

6134.08 --> 6140.82
arguments and funny thing though is is

6137.02 --> 6144.360000000001
that they're not getting unbanned I

6140.82 --> 6144.36
don't need them anymore

6149.22 --> 6152.379
[Music]

6167.9 --> 6173.0
that's ridiculous you can't really

6170.57 --> 6175.58
compare any of that stars you don't even

6173.0 --> 6178.1
know what stars are even if you go by

6175.58 --> 6180.74
the heliocentric model then that already

6178.1 --> 6184.25
reveals that it's so farther away so now

6180.74 --> 6186.5599999999995
you can't compare stars that are like

6184.25 --> 6190.46
billions of times further away than or

6186.56 --> 6192.17
suppose its Sun their visibility being a

6190.46 --> 6193.55
wave during daylight you can't even

6192.17 --> 6196.1900000000005
compare that to a thing that's

6193.55 --> 6199.400000000001
supposedly at close proximity floating

6196.19 --> 6203.15
around us how can you come how can you

6199.4 --> 6205.219999999999
say that stars are not visible and that

6203.15 --> 6207.11
that is a good enough reason not to be

6205.22 --> 6212.12
able to see the ISS during the daytime

6207.11 --> 6218.66
that is just [ __ ] it's much closer

6212.12 --> 6221.96
you can see planes right it's how much

6218.66 --> 6226.16
further is the ISS supposedly away from

6221.96 --> 6226.64
the general air line to the surface of

6226.16 --> 6229.599999999999
the earth

6226.64 --> 6229.6
Karen B do you know this

6238.369 --> 6248.53
what's it gonna be maybe four five times

6243.02 --> 6248.530000000001
further away right something like that a

6249.369 --> 6254.36
globe ease think they they have

6251.81 --> 6256.34
superhuman eyes and then when it

6254.36 --> 6259.369
switches around they're completely blind

6256.34 --> 6262.2390000000005
at the same time so yeah it's all I can

6259.369 --> 6266.33
see everything I can't see nothing yeah

6262.239 --> 6272.08
yeah it's 250 miles right so what is the

6266.33 --> 6272.08
average airplane height in comparison

6284.1 --> 6296.110000000001
55 times right okay well then that is

6292.239 --> 6299.98
quite a differential though but yeah I

6296.11 --> 6302.82
don't see why why that would obscure all

6299.98 --> 6302.82
side of it

6328.23 --> 6334.209999999999
yeah well you can stop asserting that

6331.12 --> 6338.98
now Joran up Dow and actually present

6334.21 --> 6344.41
some visual evidence some photographs or

6338.98 --> 6346.419999999999
live filmed footage of that because we

6344.41 --> 6349.21
don't care about what you believe you're

6346.42 --> 6351.13
seeing really at this point we just want

6349.21 --> 6353.76
some real evidence that it is what you

6351.13 --> 6353.76
think it is

6371.409 --> 6374.589999999999
migrating geese

6392.13 --> 6395.09
you can see

6401.59 --> 6406.360000000001
I've heard some squeaking squawking

6409.659 --> 6415.759999999999
all right

6410.989 --> 6418.03
uh yeah you can join up tall put it down

6415.76 --> 6418.030000000001
there

6431.89 --> 6440.240000000001
yeah yeah band goodbye

6436.12 --> 6442.07
look I know there's been like 10 ballers

6440.24 --> 6444.0199999999995
maybe rambling in here I'm gonna ban

6442.07 --> 6447.5599999999995
every one of you every time you make a

6444.02 --> 6451.31
freaking [ __ ] victory declaration

6447.56 --> 6453.05
comment all of you all of you and I know

6451.31 --> 6455.6
you've sucka cons and you know there's a

6453.05 --> 6457.1900000000005
hundred more retards that will be pushed

6455.6 --> 6466.06
forward to take your place

6457.19 --> 6466.0599999999995
I'll ban you all like this guy

6496.12 --> 6502.26
so hey I gave you that wrench so I want

6498.85 --> 6502.26
that link now jonov though

6513.81 --> 6518.400000000001
or were you just offering it didn't you

6516.39 --> 6518.79
expect to actually be able to put it

6518.4 --> 6521.3099999999995
down

6518.79 --> 6526.0199999999995
so was it Bluff because I yeah but a lot

6521.31 --> 6528.21
of ballers do that too so that's not

6526.02 --> 6532.490000000001
going to help you if that turns out to

6528.21 --> 6532.49
be the case so please present your link

6549.449 --> 6559.678999999999
so you don't have it okay that's just

6551.91 --> 6561.84
great yeah see it always happens always

6559.679 --> 6564.12
do it yeah look good it's right here

6561.84 --> 6570.9800000000005
yeah let me do that oh wait I don't have

6564.12 --> 6576.32
it yet okay you got it

6570.98 --> 6576.32
hmm all right let me see what you got

6582.769 --> 6595.46
Oh an airplane a shooting star and the

6594.05 --> 6599.269
slow-moving lights

6595.46 --> 6601.219
isn't that just funny yeah I've seen

6599.269 --> 6601.400000000001
them slow-moving lights yeah there they

6601.219 --> 6608.409
are

6601.4 --> 6611.089999999999
there can't really identify them however

6608.409 --> 6612.799999999999
it's funny how they almost all seem to

6611.09 --> 6615.4400000000005
be kind of moving in the same speed even

6612.8 --> 6619.070000000001
though they're like crossing paths and

6615.44 --> 6624.259999999999
[ __ ] anyway yeah thanks for the lets

6619.07 --> 6626.96
actually as a as a recording that's

6624.26 --> 6628.909000000001
actually kind of interesting it doesn't

6626.96 --> 6630.59
prove yourself like [ __ ] though however

6628.909 --> 6633.619
because it's just a bunch of freaking

6630.59 --> 6637.969
lights our satellites supposed to be

6633.619 --> 6640.46
giving off light like that anyway why

6637.969 --> 6643.76
did those satellite lights look exactly

6640.46 --> 6646.82
like the stars it's just idiotic to

6643.76 --> 6650.3
assume that that satellites in my

6646.82 --> 6652.69
opinion anyway I'll share that that was

6650.3 --> 6652.6900000000005
a good video

6658.23 --> 6661.4
[Music]

6662.49 --> 6665.82
flick through it

6685.58 --> 6694.0
okay alright so this is the link that he

6689.27 --> 6699.76
gave me and yeah it is a deep night

6694.0 --> 6704.24
video and there's a plane very obvious

6699.76 --> 6708.530000000001
then there you got the slow-moving light

6704.24 --> 6711.55
Oh a falling star how nice and then you

6708.53 --> 6715.57
got these just these slow moving lights

6711.55 --> 6718.400000000001
at some point yeah there they are

6715.57 --> 6722.599999999999
yeah I've seen that I have seen that

6718.4 --> 6726.92
with my naked eye but how is that a

6722.6 --> 6729.79
freakin satellite okay why don't you

6726.92 --> 6735.65
compare this this suppose is moving dot

6729.79 --> 6738.26
right to the one to the right or a top

6735.65 --> 6741.74
of it how is that any different how is

6738.26 --> 6745.610000000001
that and now how does that even work

6741.74 --> 6748.7
how can that set like give up similar

6745.61 --> 6752.45
amounts of light as a star when it's

6748.7 --> 6754.58
just a freaking chunk of stuff in the

6752.45 --> 6757.04
supposed dark side of the earth where

6754.58 --> 6758.99
the Sun doesn't shine how is it supposed

6757.04 --> 6761.39
to even reflect all that light to be

6758.99 --> 6765.4
visible like a star it makes no freakin

6761.39 --> 6765.400000000001
sense when you really think about it

6771.84 --> 6776.5
what what is what light is reflecting

6774.61 --> 6779.41
off these supposed satellites in order

6776.5 --> 6781.89
for them to be that bright makes no

6779.41 --> 6781.889999999999
sense

6791.92 --> 6800.11
oh not a falling one see to me it's just

6795.64 --> 6802.240000000001
lights it's lights moving well

6800.11 --> 6805.15
while not moving stars then there's the

6802.24 --> 6807.01
planets very slow moving but they do

6805.15 --> 6810.33
move in relation to the Stars and then

6807.01 --> 6814.99
there's these and these weird moving

6810.33 --> 6817.72
slow moving lights seem to keep on going

6814.99 --> 6820.66
and then you have the the very rapid

6817.72 --> 6822.37
falling stars and they do seem to venge

6820.66 --> 6825.099999999999
they don't continually go on

6822.37 --> 6827.89
so yeah that's it's a hole just a bunch

6825.1 --> 6834.820000000001
of moving lights and so it kind of looks

6827.89 --> 6839.77
the same look at that what what is is

6834.82 --> 6842.349999999999
that a satellite really and why does it

6839.77 --> 6845.080000000001
look like a star and what it's

6842.35 --> 6847.0
reflecting off it what light is

6845.08 --> 6849.49
reflecting off it in order to be that

6847.0 --> 6852.43
visible when it's supposedly on the dark

6849.49 --> 6853.7699999999995
side of the earth doesn't make any damn

6852.43 --> 6857.92
sense

6853.77 --> 6860.52
none whatsoever when you really think

6857.92 --> 6860.52
about it

6863.84 --> 6872.75
all right so I think that was enough but

6871.43 --> 6875.42
anyway thank you for the link it is a

6872.75 --> 6877.91
very interesting video to have I'm even

6875.42 --> 6880.88
gonna download this one because it's

6877.91 --> 6882.889999999999
it's basically data it's visual data

6880.88 --> 6884.75
this is this does seem like an honest

6882.89 --> 6888.92
recording I don't even know what was

6884.75 --> 6891.44
said I probably can just leave the

6888.92 --> 6893.11
entire sound out of it because the

6891.44 --> 6896.95
visuals were interesting

6893.11 --> 6896.95
so thank you for sharing that

6932.42 --> 6939.71
oh really made John opt-out silver right

6937.94 --> 6946.879999999999
it's very reflective it's almost like a

6939.71 --> 6953.66
mirror right right no this is also

6946.88 --> 6961.16
silver right it's a silver so you tell

6953.66 --> 6965.599999999999
me if yeah how much of that sell fur is

6961.16 --> 6969.32
really visible when you put it in full

6965.6 --> 6973.42
darkness you know how much can you see

6969.32 --> 6975.74
of that it's not a lot

6973.42 --> 6979.22
doesn't seem very bright now does it

6975.74 --> 6980.599999999999
when there's no light shining on it when

6979.22 --> 6982.52
there is some lecture and see now

6980.6 --> 6985.25
there's some light reflective from the

6982.52 --> 6989.51
Sun yeah that some reflection makes it

6985.25 --> 6992.3
pretty visible but it's on the dark side

6989.51 --> 6994.91
of the earth it's night so the light is

6992.3 --> 6997.03
shining past the earth there's no light

6994.91 --> 7002.86
from the Sun reflecting of it

6997.03 --> 7005.46
how can it be so bright then mm-hmm but

7002.86 --> 7005.46
the Sun

7023.0 --> 7028.58
disciple don't don't make stupid jokes

7025.95 --> 7028.58
is lame

7039.28 --> 7046.54
hmm anyway I thought it was a pretty

7041.59 --> 7050.5
productive show today lots of flat earth

7046.54 --> 7053.71
lots of banning delightful yeah that I

7050.5 --> 7055.51
know troll baller trolls or even just

7053.71 --> 7058.3
general balls they come specifically

7055.51 --> 7059.62
here to get banned they know they will

7058.3 --> 7061.39
they know they're gonna go there and

7059.62 --> 7063.22
they they know they're gonna get banned

7061.39 --> 7065.200000000001
because they don't have the discipline

7063.22 --> 7067.29
they don't have to be the discipline to

7065.2 --> 7070.0
stop themselves from asserting their

7067.29 --> 7072.49
religious [ __ ] and their gamma

7070.0 --> 7076.15
behavior that is accompanying that they

7072.49 --> 7079.99
can do it they know it because if they

7076.15 --> 7083.62
would that shut up sit there and ask

7079.99 --> 7086.5599999999995
good questions and maybe give some

7083.62 --> 7090.01
admission sometime like yeah that does

7086.56 --> 7092.38
seem to be a bit of a problem hmm that

7090.01 --> 7094.150000000001
kind of thing you know it they can't do

7092.38 --> 7096.16
that you know they know they know the

7094.15 --> 7097.78
real religious fanatics that have been

7096.16 --> 7100.03
through this a lot of time knows that

7097.78 --> 7102.46
every time they do it they have to keep

7100.03 --> 7104.95
on doing it because these types of

7102.46 --> 7107.41
problems are everywhere throughout

7104.95 --> 7108.849999999999
Riddle throughout the entire body of

7107.41 --> 7111.43
science that they utilize it's

7108.85 --> 7113.4400000000005
everywhere so they'll be forced to go in

7111.43 --> 7115.240000000001
like moans like hmm that is kind of

7113.44 --> 7116.7699999999995
weird maybe I should look into this a

7115.24 --> 7118.78
little deeper they're gonna keep on

7116.77 --> 7120.610000000001
doing it until they either say it was

7118.78 --> 7123.009999999999
cruel is I'm not gonna do that anymore

7120.61 --> 7127.719999999999
I'm just gonna grab my rage or they

7123.01 --> 7131.2
gonna figure out damn I thought the

7127.72 --> 7134.35
globe was like that made sense but when

7131.2 --> 7137.2
you really look into it it's almost

7134.35 --> 7140.1900000000005
impossible to really prove beyond some

7137.2 --> 7145.0199999999995
math assertions and all that nonsense so

7140.19 --> 7145.0199999999995
yeah it's tough it's tough

7154.05 --> 7156.71
all right

7157.3 --> 7162.25
yeah if these suppose that Sun is not

7159.73 --> 7164.53
there to brighten up the atmosphere

7162.25 --> 7167.56
right to give all that lights that

7164.53 --> 7170.32
drowns out the light from the stars well

7167.56 --> 7174.52
that means that objects presupposes Li

7170.32 --> 7176.0199999999995
close to that ball floating up there are

7174.52 --> 7178.75
not going to reflect a lot of sunlight

7176.02 --> 7181.330000000001
either since they are literally in the

7178.75 --> 7183.13
shadow side of the earth the presupposed

7181.33 --> 7186.13
shadow side of the earth versus the Sun

7183.13 --> 7188.71
so what is reflecting of that at such a

7186.13 --> 7193.72
fast distance that you would see star

7188.71 --> 7198.12
like light and I just showed you it does

7193.72 --> 7198.12
absolutely look like star like light

7203.49 --> 7214.8099999999995
sunlight will hit them he can't hit the

7211.99 --> 7217.03
atmosphere but can hit the satellite

7214.81 --> 7219.1900000000005
because the sunlight like there's this

7217.03 --> 7222.07
ball earth and then the sunlight bends

7219.19 --> 7223.299999999999
around it and it want to light up the

7222.07 --> 7226.34
atmosphere but it will hit those

7223.3 --> 7229.4890000000005
satellites so you can see the satellites

7226.34 --> 7229.4890000000005
[Music]

7229.89 --> 7237.0
hmm it's a very weird system

7246.01 --> 7253.67
mashed potatoes and gravity yeah anyway

7251.99 --> 7257.48
I'm gonna round out to show it's it's

7253.67 --> 7260.3
been an interesting Sunday show a lot of

7257.48 --> 7261.98
Flat Earth it was kind of good

7260.3 --> 7265.1900000000005
lots of satellite so I'll definitely

7261.98 --> 7266.389999999999
watch this one back now it's ok you

7265.19 --> 7270.32
don't have to be worried about

7266.39 --> 7275.09
triggering me it's just and thank you

7270.32 --> 7277.34
for for staying decent not getting all

7275.09 --> 7279.2300000000005

early-bird number 397 and yeah there's

7327.58 --> 7331.76
stairs there's a globe Busters to
