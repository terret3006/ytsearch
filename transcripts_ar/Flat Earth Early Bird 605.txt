81.759 --> 88.799
look at that just it's a pretty

85.52 --> 88.79899999999999
interesting site isn't it

91.04 --> 98.0
but yeah it's been mostly like that

95.36 --> 98.88
and yeah there's still plenty of wind

98.0 --> 100.479
and it's still

98.88 --> 103.03999999999999
warm enough there has been no rain

tamara coffee

126.88 --> 130.72
it's a one cup was enough

131.28 --> 137.599
so let's see who is in chat

134.4 --> 137.59900000000002
it's a tuesday

138.239 --> 143.84
agm was first man young

149.76 --> 157.84
gaining wisdom or jay good servant

160.0 --> 163.92
yeah eyes wide shut

164.16 --> 172.879
good to see you all tom parker

168.48 --> 172.879
i right so uh

173.68 --> 178.87900000000002
yesterday don't make too much extensive

176.56 --> 178.879
notes

179.12 --> 184.31900000000002
i'll figure it out but yeah yesterday's

182.959 --> 187.44
flatter the uh

184.319 --> 187.44
flutters debates were

187.84 --> 191.36
were interesting although yeah i was

190.56 --> 194.4
also

191.36 --> 195.84
having very early dinner during that so

194.4 --> 198.0
i missed the part

195.84 --> 199.92000000000002
but yeah there was this guy and he was

198.0 --> 203.36
apparently

199.92 --> 205.92
i don't even know his name just this

203.36 --> 207.68
scottish sounding guy and he was

205.92 --> 209.44
actually pretending

207.68 --> 211.20000000000002
acting like he was a flat earther so

209.44 --> 216.64
that was almost like a new low

211.2 --> 216.64
but yeah right a retrospect yesterday

216.879 --> 222.959
an early bird show a vacuum

220.319 --> 222.95899999999997
or what

223.599 --> 229.2
i was a bit i didn't watch it back but i

226.48 --> 232.64
didn't really feel good

229.2 --> 235.51899999999998
of that that i

232.64 --> 237.83999999999997
like got so triggered by that freaking

235.519 --> 240.799
troll

237.84 --> 241.519
and was it even a troll it seemed like a

240.799 --> 243.36
genuine

241.519 --> 245.04
like gamma like question and it just

243.36 --> 246.959
pissed me off because he

245.04 --> 248.64
basically right in front of me opened up

246.959 --> 253.2
a whole kind of worms with

248.64 --> 253.2
all kinds of baggage and that just

257.04 --> 263.36
it was also the timing it's weird

260.32 --> 266.8
because i was kind of

263.36 --> 268.88
i say rounding out i didn't have much to

266.8 --> 270.40000000000003
latch onto so i kind of latched on to

268.88 --> 272.479
that but i went too far and it was

270.4 --> 275.03999999999996
stupid

272.479 --> 276.8
that i did that and i got a silly

275.04 --> 280.08000000000004
arwenian moment out it

276.8 --> 282.96000000000004
out of it i guess but it

280.08 --> 284.4
yeah that didn't feel like a success to

282.96 --> 286.63899999999995
me

284.4 --> 287.44
i don't know compared to what else i've

286.639 --> 289.6
been doing

287.44 --> 289.6
so

290.72 --> 295.6
yeah just letting that sink for for a

293.68 --> 297.759
while i have no idea what you guys were

295.6 --> 300.0
thinking about it if you even

297.759 --> 302.88
thought it was out of place or anything

300.0 --> 305.28
now i haven't had any feedback

302.88 --> 308.32
not even from robin stanley it's kind of

305.28 --> 311.67999999999995
odd but then again she is

308.32 --> 317.199
really busy with moving

311.68 --> 317.199
so timing it's all about the timing

322.24 --> 325.84000000000003
no problem bro

333.52 --> 340.4
oh yeah name was vacuum right

337.199 --> 340.639
yeah that guy kind of sucks like i find

340.4 --> 342.79999999999995
it

340.639 --> 344.55
annoying even listening to his voice

342.8 --> 346.24
it's like i'd rather listen to

344.55 --> 349.28000000000003
[Music]

346.24 --> 351.759
a chi key crawling through the tar

349.28 --> 353.19899999999996
very slowly i prefer listening to that

351.759 --> 356.0
than to this guy he's just

353.199 --> 356.0
[ __ ] annoying

359.199 --> 363.36
one needs to release steam once in a

360.88 --> 366.15999999999997
while but yeah roger

363.36 --> 367.68
that's that might be a point to that but

366.16 --> 370.47900000000004
i already do that i do it

367.68 --> 372.08
not on the show and i even reflect back

370.479 --> 373.919
on it on the show

372.08 --> 375.44
because i don't it's something you know

373.919 --> 377.84
when you are in

375.44 --> 380.479
communication when somebody picks it up

377.84 --> 383.52
and you do that [ __ ]

380.479 --> 386.56
it transfers like a

383.52 --> 389.44
little shock wave potentially

386.56 --> 390.24
with the wrong frequency and the problem

389.44 --> 393.68
is is that

390.24 --> 397.12
does have a negative effect

393.68 --> 400.96
even does even if just subtle

397.12 --> 400.96
it's it's a difficult to

402.56 --> 408.24
to describe although mostly it's more

406.84 --> 410.0
inwards

408.24 --> 411.599
oh i'm the one that's really strict

410.0 --> 415.039
towards myself

411.599 --> 417.039
and that i just did that felt like [ __ ]

415.039 --> 419.28
that's something i i would have let

417.039 --> 420.88
myself get away with two years ago but

419.28 --> 422.71999999999997
now it's

420.88 --> 425.44
you know i need to address this tomorrow

422.72 --> 427.84000000000003
and i'm doing that

425.44 --> 428.8
you know to you guys maybe compared to

427.84 --> 430.71999999999997
whatever

428.8 --> 432.40000000000003
everybody else is doing it's maybe not

430.72 --> 435.759
that bad or something

432.4 --> 438.56
but yeah i i've never really used

435.759 --> 441.599
what everybody else has normalized as a

438.56 --> 441.599
standard for myself

446.639 --> 450.72
but yeah it did piss me off to no end at

449.36 --> 453.12
the moment

450.72 --> 453.12
just to

453.919 --> 459.52
because i was kind of like really in the

456.8 --> 462.40000000000003
in the biblical flow

459.52 --> 464.08
it wasn't a good energy very strong and

462.4 --> 466.71999999999997
then this guy just throws that

464.08 --> 466.71999999999997
[ __ ] in there

471.599 --> 478.479
all right anyway it happened and uh

475.28 --> 482.96
yeah today is a new day

478.479 --> 482.96
so i'm not gonna hang on to that forever

484.4 --> 488.87899999999996
and nobody else really seemed to care i

486.08 --> 493.35999999999996
think but it was also just ridiculous

488.879 --> 497.12
you know

493.36 --> 498.8
like i i on purpose

497.12 --> 501.199
basically said something that i

498.8 --> 503.919
absolutely don't agree with

501.199 --> 505.28000000000003
but that kind of like from is fueled

503.919 --> 508.479
from the inside with the

505.28 --> 512.88
like a with a rage

508.479 --> 516.08
that that's not good for anything

512.88 --> 521.2
and yeah that's just

516.08 --> 523.519
shouldn't do that

521.2 --> 523.519
you know

524.399 --> 527.92
like it's weird because uh for example

527.36 --> 530.08
the

527.92 --> 532.0
the holes yeah with big bear and i did

530.08 --> 536.0
also watch him i think

532.0 --> 537.76
right yeah i forgot to make a note

536.0 --> 539.36
after some point i just forgot to make

537.76 --> 541.8389999999999
notes but it's

539.36 --> 542.72
yeah the the running joke or well part

541.839 --> 544.8800000000001
of the legacy

542.72 --> 546.1600000000001
is also like what's next didn't you say

544.88 --> 548.56
it and all that

546.16 --> 550.7199999999999
and yeah i basically took that but then

548.56 --> 550.7199999999999
i

551.2 --> 555.0400000000001
broke the joke by basically raging

554.16 --> 557.1999999999999
full-on

555.04 --> 559.519
with it like pushing forward beyond the

557.2 --> 562.6400000000001
joke and that's

559.519 --> 565.279
it's not funny and then suddenly the

562.64 --> 568.3199999999999
full weight of the actual words

565.279 --> 569.4399999999999
starts to reach through and that's it's

568.32 --> 574.08
not good it's

569.44 --> 577.2
it is like in the situation the world is

574.08 --> 580.64
like this is a potential

577.2 --> 581.9200000000001
yeah risk in some way like there's

580.64 --> 583.68
pressure

581.92 --> 585.3199999999999
and the pressure is only increased by

583.68 --> 587.8389999999999
the pre-programming and the

585.32 --> 590.72
desensitization and all that and

587.839 --> 591.7600000000001
yeah it's not something to joke about

590.72 --> 593.44
actually

591.76 --> 595.279
it's only to joke about people that

593.44 --> 597.9200000000001
obsess over it and that's what makes

595.279 --> 602.0
owen benjamin's joke about it funny

597.92 --> 605.8389999999999
but what i did was not funny and so yeah

602.0 --> 606.24
i needed to address that and technically

605.839 --> 610.32
for

606.24 --> 610.32
whoever cares about it i apologize

613.44 --> 620.5600000000001
i guess i'm apologizing to myself

617.279 --> 633.8389999999999
nobody seems to care anyway

620.56 --> 633.8389999999999
let's move on

642.079 --> 646.079
yeah i think i just yesterday the

645.2 --> 648.399
weather was

646.079 --> 650.64
even into the evening just pleasant i

648.399 --> 652.8
think it later started to rain a little

650.64 --> 653.92
it didn't last long so i've just been

652.8 --> 657.279
enjoying the weather and

653.92 --> 657.279
kind of relaxing yesterday

658.32 --> 664.399
it's a bit of a game here and

661.44 --> 666.8800000000001
yeah nothing special no any interesting

664.399 --> 666.88
videos

668.56 --> 671.68
yeah the flat earth debates of course

670.64 --> 675.36
streams and

671.68 --> 678.399
all that oh yeah tony uploaded like

675.36 --> 679.839
that video of his was kind of weird like

678.399 --> 681.68
even by his standards

679.839 --> 689.839
no like it was weird i don't know if

681.68 --> 689.8389999999999
anybody picked up on that

691.04 --> 694.399
okie dokie cleary

696.399 --> 699.6
i didn't know

699.92 --> 703.8389999999999
can't say i care too much

714.839 --> 717.839
right

719.44 --> 724.5600000000001
tropical weather in canada what

724.639 --> 731.839
is it warm too like warm and rainy

732.32 --> 736.0790000000001
oh right clearly yeah they lost the

734.24 --> 737.92
technology too

736.079 --> 741.3599999999999
it's too difficult to put it all back

737.92 --> 745.1999999999999
again they can't just start from scratch

741.36 --> 746.88
for some mystical reason makes no sense

745.2 --> 748.88
or basically what they are admitting is

746.88 --> 750.32
that despite all this modeling all the

748.88 --> 752.639
technology all the

750.32 --> 754.1600000000001
3d systems that they now have to even

752.639 --> 756.88
represent it

754.16 --> 759.8389999999999
they apparently have no idea how the

756.88 --> 759.8389999999999
original

760.079 --> 764.399
makers of the moon landing program how

762.399 --> 767.519
they actually accomplished it because

764.399 --> 770.16
apparently any models that were left

767.519 --> 772.0
from the pre-planning of it all were

770.16 --> 774.8
absolutely not sufficient to

772.0 --> 776.48
explain how they did it you know that's

774.8 --> 779.8389999999999
another way of looking at it from a

776.48 --> 779.839
perspective that they are

780.16 --> 783.8389999999999
yeah that they might actually be genuine

783.04 --> 787.8389999999999
which is kind of

783.839 --> 787.839
ridiculous at this point but

788.97 --> 794.48
[Music]

791.44 --> 796.24
it's such a bizarre setup

794.48 --> 798.24
you know if you think about it like oh

796.24 --> 800.5600000000001
it was all being kept secret from the

798.24 --> 803.12
russians or something then maybe

800.56 --> 803.8389999999999
yeah maybe the original plan was really

803.12 --> 805.04
secret

803.839 --> 806.72
and then it would be lost but

805.04 --> 808.24
technically that's not really how it

806.72 --> 810.0790000000001
played out

808.24 --> 812.16
because i think even during the cold war

810.079 --> 812.56
they were kind of cooperating with it so

812.16 --> 814.16
that

812.56 --> 819.04
technically wouldn't make any sense

814.16 --> 819.04
according to the story as it unfolded

819.519 --> 829.839
oh clearly i don't i don't really

824.32 --> 829.839
want to address that if you don't mind

832.0 --> 837.36
i gotta attract to the moon i'm sure you

840.839 --> 843.839
are

857.94 --> 860.979
[Music]

863.279 --> 868.48
likely to believe it well let's just see

866.639 --> 869.6
what they present you know if it's just

868.48 --> 871.9200000000001
more of the same

869.6 --> 873.839
with maybe better camera quality or

871.92 --> 875.92
whatever little better thought out

873.839 --> 878.0
setups to emulate how it's supposed to

875.92 --> 879.5999999999999
be according to them

878.0 --> 881.199
i don't know you know it's still going

879.6 --> 884.48
to be a matter of yeah let's see this

881.199 --> 887.639
singular shot

884.48 --> 891.1990000000001
take off to the singular

887.639 --> 892.639
uninterrupted shot preferably multiple

891.199 --> 896.0
angles at the same time

892.639 --> 898.5600000000001
like a spread out multi-camera

896.0 --> 901.44
all non-stop singular shots

898.56 --> 904.4799999999999
non-interrupted

901.44 --> 904.48
not caught up and then just

904.639 --> 908.5600000000001
just the earth going away and

908.639 --> 913.36
and then oh it's the ball and then oh

911.6 --> 915.24
yeah at the same time on the front

913.36 --> 918.24
camera which is also going to have to

915.24 --> 920.48
simultaneously be

918.24 --> 922.0
non-stop shot like oh the moon it's

920.48 --> 924.72
getting closer and now

922.0 --> 928.8
the moon is so big oh it's so big now oh

924.72 --> 928.8000000000001
look it's like you can actually see

929.279 --> 934.639
the geometric horizon

932.8 --> 936.3199999999999
and all that blah blah blah like that

934.639 --> 939.04
right

936.32 --> 940.5600000000001
if they put that in there yeah i'm gonna

939.04 --> 943.92
be scratching my hat a little

940.56 --> 947.199
because it's like okay yeah

943.92 --> 949.199
don't really have that argument to

947.199 --> 951.12
directly stand upon although yeah that

949.199 --> 951.519
should absolutely be scrutinized of

951.12 --> 955.519
course

951.519 --> 959.68
and analyzed by uh photo forensics

955.519 --> 962.72
experts and all that film footage

959.68 --> 965.68
forensics but yeah

962.72 --> 967.279
that at least would be a start you know

965.68 --> 968.6389999999999
this is

967.279 --> 970.639
if it's just going to be more of the

968.639 --> 973.04
same the same setup [ __ ]

970.639 --> 974.0790000000001
like oh start oh you switched the camera

973.04 --> 978.079
oh looked curved

974.079 --> 980.3199999999999
oh look it's it's now okay to look back

978.079 --> 984.6389999999999
and look at the earth as a ball

980.32 --> 988.0790000000001
no yeah three step shots

984.639 --> 990.48
if they can bypass that

988.079 --> 991.3599999999999
then well that would that would be

990.48 --> 994.639
mind-boggling

991.36 --> 997.839
first of all that they figured out a way

994.639 --> 1001.199
there where they would dare to

997.839 --> 1004.5600000000001
and then yeah we'll have to

1001.199 --> 1004.56
figure it out from there on

1004.72 --> 1007.44
can't be done

1009.12 --> 1016.079
right well so far they haven't been able

1012.959 --> 1019.68
to figure out a way to do it

1016.079 --> 1022.959
but yeah just think of it like this

1019.68 --> 1025.6
what if they managed to convince a

1022.959 --> 1027.4389999999999
computer system to basically presuppose

1025.6 --> 1029.52
everything like a baller

1027.439 --> 1031.8390000000002
and and truly simulate that as real

1029.52 --> 1034.16
basically creating a separate

1031.839 --> 1037.36
simulated super high intelligent baller

1034.16 --> 1039.52
that would figure out exactly

1037.36 --> 1041.039
what it would be like from like a

1039.52 --> 1046.48
suspense of disbelief

1041.039 --> 1046.48
position and maybe

1048.24 --> 1051.52
it did figure it out at some point how

1050.799 --> 1054.08
to do that

1051.52 --> 1055.9189999999999
where nobody could puzzle it like they

1054.08 --> 1056.6399999999999
just couldn't agree to it and maybe it

1055.919 --> 1059.919
has

1056.64 --> 1062.0800000000002
basically decided like yes i

1059.919 --> 1064.72
understand why you couldn't figure it

1062.08 --> 1066.0
out this is how you do it in order to

1064.72 --> 1068.72
convince everybody that

1066.0 --> 1068.72
that is real

1070.799 --> 1074.4
assuming that it must be real from that

1073.52 --> 1077.44
perspective

1074.4 --> 1079.44
but basically working towards

1077.44 --> 1081.28
the eventual proof that will always be

1079.44 --> 1082.24
out of reach based on presupposition

1081.28 --> 1085.039
right that's how

1082.24 --> 1086.72
i think that if they have some kind of

1085.039 --> 1090.0
interesting ai

1086.72 --> 1092.32
that has consciousness based

1090.0 --> 1095.84
emulations that they might be actually

1092.32 --> 1095.84
able to do that

1096.24 --> 1102.4
anyway hi hi

1099.6 --> 1104.6399999999999
dude how high do you think we have been

1102.4 --> 1108.799
i don't know

1104.64 --> 1110.64
i have no idea

1108.799 --> 1112.48
there seems to be some kind of barrier

1110.64 --> 1114.0800000000002
at some point and there is the relative

1112.48 --> 1117.2
density problem that

1114.08 --> 1118.72
cannot be overcome just using matter

1117.2 --> 1122.32
alone

1118.72 --> 1123.3600000000001
and propulsion now this so because at

1122.32 --> 1125.28
some point the

1123.36 --> 1127.12
density of the air and whatever is up

1125.28 --> 1129.6789999999999
there is going to be too low for

1127.12 --> 1131.039
any kind of thing that we make to move

1129.679 --> 1132.5590000000002
beyond it

1131.039 --> 1135.44
it's going to have to be some kind of

1132.559 --> 1137.36
electrostatic propulsion

1135.44 --> 1138.64
or something that will literally change

1137.36 --> 1142.559
the the very

1138.64 --> 1146.24
effective density of the object in order

1142.559 --> 1149.6
to just bypass that completely

1146.24 --> 1152.96
so until that is achieved

1149.6 --> 1155.1999999999998
it's yeah you really can't

1152.96 --> 1157.44
get above a certain point no matter what

1155.2 --> 1157.44
you do

1158.08 --> 1162.3999999999999
except through sheer momentum as

1160.08 --> 1163.28
suggested with rockets and well some of

1162.4 --> 1165.2800000000002
those

1163.28 --> 1167.2
seem to be bumping into something in

1165.28 --> 1170.48
energy field

1167.2 --> 1172.0800000000002
now i've even yeah i didn't even bring

1170.48 --> 1174.08
it up

1172.08 --> 1177.039
i've been thinking about that potential

1174.08 --> 1180.559
energy field barrier that's there right

1177.039 --> 1183.6
and then i thought of the movie dune

1180.559 --> 1184.559
remember it's not directly related but

1183.6 --> 1188.559
in june there

1184.559 --> 1191.12
the original won the original movie

1188.559 --> 1193.2
there was like a special training thing

1191.12 --> 1193.52
at the beginning which was showing off

1193.2 --> 1196.4
like

1193.52 --> 1197.76
super high tech and they used very like

1196.4 --> 1201.679
a crystal

1197.76 --> 1203.919
cubic type shield personal shields

1201.679 --> 1204.799
and it looked kind of weird but

1203.919 --> 1207.8400000000001
interesting

1204.799 --> 1208.72
it was all non-computer animated effects

1207.84 --> 1212.0
so it was pretty

1208.72 --> 1212.0
fascinating to look at that

1212.96 --> 1217.2
or what or it was very primitive and

1215.2 --> 1217.679
then overdrawn so it had an interesting

1217.2 --> 1220.24
look

1217.679 --> 1222.0
but there was this special lesson that

1220.24 --> 1223.44
for some reason they were

1222.0 --> 1225.039
was as part of the book they were

1223.44 --> 1227.679
teaching and that is that

1225.039 --> 1228.8799999999999
yeah if you just slap against the shield

1227.679 --> 1232.0800000000002
like with your knife

1228.88 --> 1234.0
bang it fences it off and you can use

1232.08 --> 1236.08
that you like can even create counter

1234.0 --> 1237.039
momentum to make the shield bounce off

1236.08 --> 1241.039
something

1237.039 --> 1244.8799999999999
but the slow knife penetrates the shield

1241.039 --> 1248.08
right so maybe that is part of the trick

1244.88 --> 1251.5200000000002
maybe that's a secret reference to yeah

1248.08 --> 1254.48
altitude experiments

1251.52 --> 1256.72
tests that have been done by actual

1254.48 --> 1258.24
covert explorers in the secret society

1256.72 --> 1259.679
and that they figured out wait there is

1258.24 --> 1262.08
a shield up there

1259.679 --> 1264.159
the only way to even be able to reach it

1262.08 --> 1266.6399999999999
beyond the low density

1264.159 --> 1269.7600000000002
region is by getting momentum but the

1266.64 --> 1272.4
problem is is that the momentum itself

1269.76 --> 1276.799
seems to be stopping the object from

1272.4 --> 1279.8400000000001
being able to penetrate the shield

1276.799 --> 1283.28
so you got a a a

1279.84 --> 1285.039
countering double situation super low

1283.28 --> 1286.8799999999999
density you can only get through it by

1285.039 --> 1289.36
momentum and then a shield

1286.88 --> 1291.8400000000001
which you can only get through without

1289.36 --> 1291.84
momentum

1292.0 --> 1295.679
now the only technical way that i can

1294.32 --> 1298.3999999999999
even think of

1295.679 --> 1300.4
using somewhat of a science fiction

1298.4 --> 1303.2800000000002
approach

1300.4 --> 1304.799
to achieve that is by electrostatic

1303.28 --> 1307.28
propulsion by literally

1304.799 --> 1308.08
using electrostatics in some way using

1307.28 --> 1311.9189999999999
the

1308.08 --> 1315.6
atlantean technique as part of it

1311.919 --> 1318.5590000000002
to literally make an object a craft

1315.6 --> 1319.6
weightless comp effectively weightless

1318.559 --> 1321.52
effectively so

1319.6 --> 1324.48
such a low density that it'll be lighter

1321.52 --> 1327.679
than helium itself the entire thing

1324.48 --> 1328.559
and then that could slowly ascend until

1327.679 --> 1333.8400000000001
the shield

1328.559 --> 1333.84
basically sit against it and then

1334.24 --> 1338.08
slowly penetrate the shield

1338.72 --> 1341.76
and move beyond that because there is a

1341.12 --> 1344.799
beyond

1341.76 --> 1346.72
i'm pretty sure there is and there's

1344.799 --> 1348.48
more air probably above there or who

1346.72 --> 1350.159
knows maybe it'll turn out to be water i

1348.48 --> 1352.88
don't think so because then

1350.159 --> 1354.7990000000002
if you would get closer to the shield

1352.88 --> 1359.679
you would see that

1354.799 --> 1363.84
water has too much of refractive effects

1359.679 --> 1365.919
in order to just not see it be affected

1363.84 --> 1367.12
as you bounce against a surface of it

1365.919 --> 1368.7990000000002
it's impossible

1367.12 --> 1371.76
so i think there's just more air beyond

1368.799 --> 1375.039
the shield and whatever is beyond there

1371.76 --> 1377.52
i don't know a big cave

1375.039 --> 1379.44
crystal cave maybe there's there's an

1377.52 --> 1381.2
ice dome

1379.44 --> 1383.3600000000001
because it's just so cold up there it's

1381.2 --> 1387.2
all just frozen

1383.36 --> 1392.24
i don't know i have no idea

1387.2 --> 1394.72
but yeah that's

1392.24 --> 1397.52
yeah they're an idea derived from a

1394.72 --> 1399.44
science fiction movie

1397.52 --> 1401.679
and since i'm starting to think there is

1399.44 --> 1405.52
some kind of shield there

1401.679 --> 1407.8400000000001
as an inter-between dome situation

1405.52 --> 1409.039
think that maybe it reference it because

1407.84 --> 1412.0
things do seem to

1409.039 --> 1412.48
bounce off it and yeah i already drew

1412.0 --> 1416.08
out the

1412.48 --> 1419.3600000000001
logical trainer thought concerning that

1416.08 --> 1422.96
who built the shield what what

1419.36 --> 1426.1589999999999
how do you mean built the designer

1422.96 --> 1431.52
it's probably been there for a long time

1426.159 --> 1434.3200000000002
or maybe it is the

1431.52 --> 1435.84
you know what just think now yeah this

1434.32 --> 1437.4399999999998
is gonna be a bit wild

1435.84 --> 1439.6
but now we're thinking back to even

1437.44 --> 1442.8400000000001
pre-atlantean times

1439.6 --> 1444.24
uh there seems to be indications that

1442.84 --> 1446.799
humans

1444.24 --> 1449.039
or our ancestors were probably bigger

1446.799 --> 1449.039
and

1449.44 --> 1452.72
and that there were just even separate

1451.84 --> 1455.9189999999999
giants that

1452.72 --> 1458.0
kind of stayed giants over the ages but

1455.919 --> 1461.679
that humans seem to be getting smaller

1458.0 --> 1464.799
it seems if you draw that draw that

1461.679 --> 1468.64
through then maybe the shield

1464.799 --> 1471.9189999999999
was the original protection

1468.64 --> 1472.48
for a giant city that was the earth

1471.919 --> 1474.0800000000002
realm

1472.48 --> 1476.159
when everything was just a lot bigger

1474.08 --> 1478.24
and there might be more beyond there

1476.159 --> 1480.3200000000002
and it was an original protection as it

1478.24 --> 1482.08
were for the castle against the rest of

1480.32 --> 1485.36
the realm

1482.08 --> 1487.9189999999999
and then the control was lost over it

1485.36 --> 1490.6399999999999
it basically crumbled in itself and the

1487.919 --> 1492.96
and the bubble stayed

1490.64 --> 1494.88
it just stayed there might even be

1492.96 --> 1497.2
manipulable we don't know

1494.88 --> 1498.96
at ground level if there isn't even is a

1497.2 --> 1502.559
touchdown point

1498.96 --> 1506.559
right so that

1502.559 --> 1509.44
or it is simply a natural

1506.559 --> 1511.36
mechanism as part of the realm because

1509.44 --> 1513.2
the only thing so for

1511.36 --> 1515.12
the yeah of which there is proof is that

1513.2 --> 1518.48
that energy field seems to be

1515.12 --> 1521.279
up there you know everybody says ah

1518.48 --> 1523.279
there this is curve there must be a

1521.279 --> 1525.919
derma dome it

1523.279 --> 1526.72
must be there a thing that touches the

1525.919 --> 1529.5200000000002
ground right

1526.72 --> 1530.96
well where's the proof of that exactly

1529.52 --> 1534.0
right

1530.96 --> 1536.559
so yeah it could also simply be

1534.0 --> 1538.0
an energy layer that is just a natural

1536.559 --> 1540.8799999999999
inherent mechanism

1538.0 --> 1543.12
built into the entire design of the

1540.88 --> 1546.96
realm

1543.12 --> 1550.2399999999998
or it could be a super ancient

1546.96 --> 1553.039
earthling based mechanism

1550.24 --> 1557.36
that still stands after yeah the

1553.039 --> 1559.84
countless ages

1557.36 --> 1560.7199999999998
after everything inside has changed so

1559.84 --> 1562.6399999999999
dramatically

1560.72 --> 1565.52
we are absolutely we wouldn't even

1562.64 --> 1568.24
recognize what was originally there

1565.52 --> 1569.2
it was would be so alien so huge to us

1568.24 --> 1572.32
we would all feel like

1569.2 --> 1574.0
ants in a world that just is completely

1572.32 --> 1577.4399999999998
different and the energies are different

1574.0 --> 1577.44
and everybody's telepathic and

1584.64 --> 1587.679
oh

1585.2 --> 1591.52
[Music]

1587.679 --> 1594.72
yeah you have a valentine

1591.52 --> 1596.84
so sad when somebody's just putting it

1594.72 --> 1599.2
all out there

1596.84 --> 1602.1589999999999
just

1599.2 --> 1604.0
just thinking very with very broad

1602.159 --> 1613.0390000000002
strokes

1604.0 --> 1614.48
yeah i can do that right so anyway hey

1613.039 --> 1616.559
for who cares you know

1614.48 --> 1619.76
for those who care about the idea oh the

1616.559 --> 1619.76
dome what maybe beyonce

1621.679 --> 1624.88
well i think there's probably some kind

1623.44 --> 1628.159
of energy shield

1624.88 --> 1630.0
things bounce off it there's definitely

1628.159 --> 1631.279
not water beyond because when something

1630.0 --> 1633.279
bounces off it

1631.279 --> 1636.24
the only way that is even recognized is

1633.279 --> 1638.799
by the trajectory change of the object

1636.24 --> 1640.64
and disruption or whatever and not

1638.799 --> 1642.799
visual distortion that would indicate

1640.64 --> 1646.64
that there is a surface

1642.799 --> 1649.36
of water next to the air that is

1646.64 --> 1651.279
changing its geometry which would have

1649.36 --> 1653.4399999999998
all kinds of visual consequences in a

1651.279 --> 1656.08
direct sense

1653.44 --> 1657.44
right so that draws me to conclude there

1656.08 --> 1659.76
is some kind of energy

1657.44 --> 1660.72
field or shield it might be natural to

1659.76 --> 1665.919
the

1660.72 --> 1669.52
to the realm or it may be an archaic

1665.919 --> 1673.44
very incredibly ancient protection

1669.52 --> 1678.48
shield from so long ago that just

1673.44 --> 1683.8400000000001
it's so beyond us yeah

1678.48 --> 1683.84
that yeah we're just out of our concern

1685.84 --> 1701.4399999999998
i don't know

1697.6 --> 1711.84
first second and third heaven

1701.44 --> 1711.8400000000001
okay all right

1714.799 --> 1719.12
but yeah when it concerns to the like

1716.88 --> 1722.0
the other realms i don't think that

1719.12 --> 1722.0
it's about

1722.159 --> 1725.679
literal spatiality there's no direct

1724.88 --> 1728.96
direction

1725.679 --> 1731.6000000000001
it's more of frequency it's through

1728.96 --> 1732.48
and when you go through towards the

1731.6 --> 1737.36
light

1732.48 --> 1739.44
then yeah the deeper you go into that

1737.36 --> 1740.559
with your spirit because your physical

1739.44 --> 1743.6000000000001
being is bound

1740.559 --> 1745.36
by the physical realm then if that is

1743.6 --> 1747.84
allowed if those gates are open

1745.36 --> 1748.6399999999999
for some reason then maybe yeah first

1747.84 --> 1750.32
heaven

1748.64 --> 1753.039
deeper through the second heaven the

1750.32 --> 1756.6399999999999
third half maybe

1753.039 --> 1756.64
that's how i would interpret it

1764.399 --> 1771.039
no not really wow what's everybody's

1768.24 --> 1771.039
problem today

1778.84 --> 1781.84
sheesh

1782.48 --> 1789.3600000000001
there is a border of realm

1785.679 --> 1791.52
oh martin telberg yeah that's the issue

1789.36 --> 1794.32
there is no direct proof that

1791.52 --> 1795.2
this energy shield thing that things

1794.32 --> 1798.48
bump into

1795.2 --> 1798.48
has a touchdown point

1798.88 --> 1805.5200000000002
there's only inference

1802.399 --> 1807.1999999999998
see there's no direct evidence so until

1805.52 --> 1809.12
it's there i'm gonna keep the options

1807.2 --> 1812.24
open

1809.12 --> 1814.4799999999998
maybe ascribe it to a natural mechanism

1812.24 --> 1816.64
as part of the original realm design

1814.48 --> 1818.08
the entirety of it or maybe even like a

1816.64 --> 1820.48
natural side effect but

1818.08 --> 1821.6
it would be part of the design then just

1820.48 --> 1825.919
something that would

1821.6 --> 1828.48
naturally arrive due to how the energies

1825.919 --> 1829.8400000000001
are distributed work all that way beyond

1828.48 --> 1832.0
their understanding it could be like

1829.84 --> 1832.0
that

1834.84 --> 1837.84
dude

1838.88 --> 1842.159
no don't do that

1842.48 --> 1853.6
you know you're not supposed to do that

1851.12 --> 1854.6399999999999
he's just trying to be trollish though

1853.6 --> 1858.48
but there's no

1854.64 --> 1859.8400000000001
real perversion here like what what is

1858.48 --> 1861.76
exactly the cold bit

1859.84 --> 1862.9599999999998
you know here here they go again like

1861.76 --> 1866.24
what cult

1862.96 --> 1869.3600000000001
no the globe is the freaking cult what

1866.24 --> 1869.36
what is a call it is

1869.84 --> 1875.36
learning a doctrine and then

1873.36 --> 1878.08
basically putting your entire spirit

1875.36 --> 1881.9189999999999
behind the defense of that doctrine

1878.08 --> 1885.039
outside of reason and reason is based on

1881.919 --> 1888.159
logic and proof disproof

1885.039 --> 1892.399
all that the whole works

1888.159 --> 1894.7990000000002
so who's exactly the cult here

1892.399 --> 1896.8799999999999
because i am very much open for

1894.799 --> 1900.399
criticism but criticism on my

1896.88 --> 1902.3200000000002
ideas and how i establish them

1900.399 --> 1904.0
and i will elaborate if somebody has

1902.32 --> 1906.48
trouble understanding them

1904.0 --> 1908.32
but that's not at home is not the type

1906.48 --> 1912.88
of thing i'm open for

1908.32 --> 1915.12
so if you're just going to say here this

1912.88 --> 1917.0390000000002
your dad oh you're so crazy you're so

1915.12 --> 1921.9189999999999
stupid

1917.039 --> 1935.84
yeah that's that doesn't even address

1921.919 --> 1935.8400000000001
anything so just so you know

1936.84 --> 1940.33
[Music]

1940.72 --> 1945.76
ah that's from

1946.88 --> 1951.919
yeah that that's fascinating oricon

1949.279 --> 1951.919
maroon

1952.48 --> 1956.72
damn the name of you but yeah that's

1954.64 --> 1959.8400000000001
from the beastie boys

1956.72 --> 1961.3600000000001
and that was a very famous song it's

1959.84 --> 1963.279
funny how

1961.36 --> 1965.6
they yeah now that you're mentioning it

1963.279 --> 1966.399
just like that they really did just say

1965.6 --> 1969.519
like

1966.399 --> 1972.32
outer space universe thinking

1969.519 --> 1974.559
the dimensional way of thinking it and

1972.32 --> 1976.24
played with that back and forth

1974.559 --> 1977.6789999999999
almost like oh these are interesting

1976.24 --> 1980.0
words but now that you're putting it

1977.679 --> 1983.44
like that

1980.0 --> 1984.48
that's fascinating you're an interesting

1983.44 --> 1987.3600000000001
person

1984.48 --> 1991.84
you do bring forth interesting things

1987.36 --> 1991.84
thanks for being part of my chat

1997.41 --> 2000.5790000000002
[Music]

2003.039 --> 2007.679
all right clearly that's exactly what

2004.559 --> 2007.6789999999999
i'm saying what i said

2009.36 --> 2016.9599999999998
yeah roger mc oh don't worry write your

2013.279 --> 2016.96
mc i'm not gonna ban you here

2017.519 --> 2024.559
i know i know nathan is

2021.36 --> 2027.279
giving you a slapping

2024.559 --> 2029.039
you do deserve it though because you are

2027.279 --> 2031.679
a complete dick

2029.039 --> 2032.799
you always have been i haven't changed

2031.679 --> 2034.64
much but yeah you

2032.799 --> 2036.799
you really should listen to nathan more

2034.64 --> 2039.8400000000001
often when he tells you

2036.799 --> 2043.279
that you have no choice you're in hell

2039.84 --> 2045.1999999999998
you hate him his show but

2043.279 --> 2047.279
every day you have to come back and you

2045.2 --> 2047.6000000000001
have you're putting all your energy and

2047.279 --> 2050.24
just

2047.6 --> 2050.24
going there and

2050.879 --> 2055.7599999999998
and doing that it's your hell and you

2053.679 --> 2058.639
don't seem to be able to step away

2055.76 --> 2058.639
it's really sad

2059.2 --> 2062.96
maybe we should think about that or not

2062.0 --> 2065.04
or you could just

2062.96 --> 2066.159
wait until the show starts in half an

2065.04 --> 2068.0
hour and just go on

2066.159 --> 2069.9190000000003
flat earth debates chat and do it all

2068.0 --> 2072.399
over again with your

2069.919 --> 2075.839
200 suck accounts or how many however

2072.399 --> 2075.839
many you have

2077.52 --> 2080.24
good luck with that

2086.159 --> 2089.76
i don't know if roger mc is soundly i i

2088.56 --> 2092.32
don't think he is

2089.76 --> 2095.44
i don't care i don't care about soundly

2092.32 --> 2099.119
i don't care about who he is

2095.44 --> 2101.44
they're they're both pretty worthless

2099.119 --> 2103.2000000000003
and whatever soundly has done in his

2101.44 --> 2105.68
connection whatever he's taken on in

2103.2 --> 2109.2
order to achieve

2105.68 --> 2112.0789999999997
some of the wealth he has through his

2109.2 --> 2112.3999999999996
things he's it's all gonna come back to

2112.079 --> 2114.5600000000004
him

2112.4 --> 2117.2000000000003
every detail he's gonna have a pretty

2114.56 --> 2120.16
shitty time at some point

2117.2 --> 2120.64
because he is a pretty disgusting liar

2120.16 --> 2125.04
like a

2120.64 --> 2128.3199999999997
really really straightforward liar

2125.04 --> 2131.44
that just as a bottomless pit

2128.32 --> 2133.92
he has absolutely no care even for being

2131.44 --> 2145.839
identified as a liar

2133.92 --> 2145.839
doesn't care

2152.16 --> 2156.48
see it's very unlikely that a writer mc

2155.52 --> 2158.72
is soundly

2156.48 --> 2160.96
otherwise he'd be all over that right

2158.72 --> 2160.9599999999996
now

2163.359 --> 2166.56
he doesn't care

2166.64 --> 2171.7599999999998
now roger mc actually thinks he's got

2169.76 --> 2173.76
nathan because nathan

2171.76 --> 2175.8390000000004
during the hangout was convinced that he

2173.76 --> 2179.3590000000004
was soundly

2175.839 --> 2183.2
and that's like oh my god in this

2179.359 --> 2185.92
eternal hell did i finally after

2183.2 --> 2186.56
wasting my half my life or however the

2185.92 --> 2190.96
[ __ ] you

2186.56 --> 2194.32
how old he is after wasting years

2190.96 --> 2198.8
if i has he finally caught nathan

2194.32 --> 2202.48
in a mistake oh my god

2198.8 --> 2205.04
oh my god you yeah the guy is in hell

2202.48 --> 2205.599
like you know when owen benjamin talks

2205.04 --> 2208.56
about

2205.599 --> 2209.52
people in hell this guy right there

2208.56 --> 2213.7599999999998
roger mc

2209.52 --> 2215.92
in chat right there he is exactly that

2213.76 --> 2217.76
and he thinks that because he's

2215.92 --> 2219.92
basically

2217.76 --> 2221.3590000000004
witnessed nathan seemingly making a

2219.92 --> 2223.839
mistake

2221.359 --> 2224.7999999999997
that he finally found a little bit of

2223.839 --> 2228.0
light

2224.8 --> 2229.76
that'll make it all worth it to him

2228.0 --> 2232.079
in his mind in his heart right now it's

2229.76 --> 2234.1600000000003
kind of like oh did i finally get

2232.079 --> 2235.119
just that drop of water through three

2234.16 --> 2236.72
years of travel

2235.119 --> 2239.359
through the desert and he thinks that

2236.72 --> 2240.56
he's it's like ecstatic over it so he

2239.359 --> 2242.88
can't stop it

2240.56 --> 2244.64
it's basically squirting non-stop just

2242.88 --> 2245.599
because you think that nathan made a

2244.64 --> 2249.2799999999997
mistake

2245.599 --> 2252.48
see i called it i called it

2249.28 --> 2256.5600000000004
this guy roger mc is

2252.48 --> 2259.68
in hell literally his spirit

2256.56 --> 2262.56
he's not here anymore buddy he's

2259.68 --> 2265.5989999999997
he's not you can see it you can feel it

2262.56 --> 2265.599
he's proud of it

2267.92 --> 2272.88
yeah this moment so big this little

2271.04 --> 2276.4
moment before the big plunge

2272.88 --> 2276.4
the plunge that never stops

2277.2 --> 2285.839
let him have his moment

2289.28 --> 2293.2000000000003
oh yeah well logical arthur i don't care

2291.359 --> 2294.88
because simon then is just a sniffling

2293.2 --> 2296.7999999999997
little [ __ ]

2294.88 --> 2298.96
and he annoys the [ __ ] out of me

2296.8 --> 2300.7200000000003
especially with this disingenuous

2298.96 --> 2304.16
attitude

2300.72 --> 2307.2
it's like oh i am going to act like

2304.16 --> 2309.68
outsiders could recognize me as being a

2307.2 --> 2312.96
potential responsible person

2309.68 --> 2313.44
while on the same level intellectually

2312.96 --> 2317.76
just

2313.44 --> 2320.4
brutally lying and just slandering and

2317.76 --> 2322.48
creating false imagery about people that

2320.4 --> 2326.48
have nothing to do with it nah

2322.48 --> 2329.92
i really dislike those type of people

2326.48 --> 2330.64
so yeah i don't care what reason he

2329.92 --> 2332.48
thinks

2330.64 --> 2334.64
i had for banning him i banned him

2332.48 --> 2337.119
because he basically

2334.64 --> 2338.839
couldn't hold back in showing who he

2337.119 --> 2341.839
really was and that's usually the

2338.839 --> 2341.839
problem

2347.28 --> 2352.079
yeah oh roger mc is going to make a

2350.32 --> 2354.6400000000003
video about it

2352.079 --> 2356.48
see he's got his moment it was all worth

2354.64 --> 2359.52
it the three years

2356.48 --> 2362.72
he thinks right now he's got a life back

2359.52 --> 2364.48
it's not true though he just saw a

2362.72 --> 2367.1189999999997
picture that reminded him

2364.48 --> 2368.079
of that there is such a thing as a life

2367.119 --> 2372.079
for just a few

2368.079 --> 2375.44
seconds and he's just holding on to that

2372.079 --> 2377.8390000000004
as he's sliding slowly down into the

2375.44 --> 2377.839
abyss

2378.24 --> 2382.3199999999997
but yeah if you've seen darkness for so

2380.32 --> 2384.4
deep so long then

2382.32 --> 2385.6800000000003
even the slightest bit of light is just

2384.4 --> 2387.44
ecstatic

2385.68 --> 2397.839
for the time being but it's not going to

2387.44 --> 2397.839
last very long though

2400.0 --> 2405.92
all right yeah

2403.599 --> 2407.48
well i don't do that so yeah you may do

2405.92 --> 2410.56
that

2407.48 --> 2412.48
drukowski yeah but that's a straw man

2410.56 --> 2415.599
because you're the one that does that

2412.48 --> 2416.64
i don't i ban people because they're

2415.599 --> 2418.2400000000002
disruptive

2416.64 --> 2422.4
because there's plenty of people here in

2418.24 --> 2422.3999999999996
my chat that do have different opinions

2422.48 --> 2428.88
huh i got there's ballers in here

2425.68 --> 2432.0789999999997
see tiny womble over there he's a baller

2428.88 --> 2434.1600000000003
very unrepentant but he actually

2432.079 --> 2436.48
knows how to behave like a human being

2434.16 --> 2441.1189999999997
he hasn't lost his entire soul

2436.48 --> 2444.56
to this and there's others

2441.119 --> 2444.56
but everybody's always here

2444.96 --> 2448.64
i have a but he's yeah he's kind of

2446.96 --> 2452.96
pissed off because we had a

2448.64 --> 2467.839
bump in the other day he's a baller

2452.96 --> 2467.839
and who else we got

2468.4 --> 2474.48
right i think martin stolbergs is also a

2472.079 --> 2474.48
baller

2475.68 --> 2479.2799999999997
not too sure if that was him but yeah i

2478.319 --> 2482.8
got ballers

2479.28 --> 2483.599
i got ballers buddy the difference is

2482.8 --> 2487.119
they're not

2483.599 --> 2489.52
[ __ ] demons they're not completely

2487.119 --> 2491.28
drowned in sociopathic disgusting

2489.52 --> 2495.839
behavior

2491.28 --> 2495.8390000000004
so they're still humans

2503.68 --> 2508.24
because eyeball hearts no [ __ ] we both

2506.839 --> 2512.48
what

2508.24 --> 2514.7999999999997
okay random ex you were a baller to

2512.48 --> 2514.8
right

2517.359 --> 2522.64
could be you know with some of you guys

2519.52 --> 2526.24
i literally forget you're a baller

2522.64 --> 2527.2
because you don't whine and act like a

2526.24 --> 2530.8799999999997
baller

2527.2 --> 2534.0789999999997
because i technically don't really care

2530.88 --> 2537.359
it's like oh yeah man it's so important

2534.079 --> 2540.0
just like oh it's so important to know

2537.359 --> 2541.2799999999997
if you consider yourself a liberal or a

2540.0 --> 2544.0
conservative it's so

2541.28 --> 2545.3590000000004
important i'm gonna judge everything on

2544.0 --> 2549.599
that no

2545.359 --> 2551.52
it's a complete waste of time really but

2549.599 --> 2552.7200000000003
there are certain types of things that

2551.52 --> 2556.4
typically do come

2552.72 --> 2560.0789999999997
with either packages

2556.4 --> 2563.76
but i try to focus on the behavior

2560.079 --> 2565.3590000000004
for first and foremost and if somebody's

2563.76 --> 2565.92
actually in the right frequency if

2565.359 --> 2570.319
somebody

2565.92 --> 2573.599
is developing it's growing

2570.319 --> 2574.079
and i pay attention also on a spiritual

2573.599 --> 2577.28
level

2574.079 --> 2579.8390000000004
you're using my senses

2577.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
mostly

2582.24 --> 2586.4799999999996
yeah roger mc you know that's never

2583.92 --> 2586.48
gonna happen

2587.04 --> 2590.88
nathan concedes when he's wrong very

2589.28 --> 2593.44
quickly

2590.88 --> 2595.04
thing is you you seem to be blocking

2593.44 --> 2597.839
that out of your mind

2595.04 --> 2601.119
for some reason you do realize he's

2597.839 --> 2603.44
already conceded right

2601.119 --> 2606.4
you probably were squirting so badly so

2603.44 --> 2608.0
hard that you were just hearing

2606.4 --> 2609.599
you just didn't pick up on it when it

2608.0 --> 2614.56
happened so now

2609.599 --> 2614.56
it's just like a day after squirt shock

2617.599 --> 2623.119
see this guy is so lost

2620.64 --> 2625.04
he literally just doesn't know what the

2623.119 --> 2628.1600000000003
[ __ ] is going on anymore

2625.04 --> 2629.119
roger mc is just completely lost he's in

2628.16 --> 2632.24
hell

2629.119 --> 2634.4
he doesn't know

2632.24 --> 2636.64
the world anymore what it is what

2634.4 --> 2639.119
reality is how it works how long it

2636.64 --> 2639.1189999999997
lasts

2639.28 --> 2645.3590000000004
you know how things are it just doesn't

2642.64 --> 2645.359
know it anymore

2645.839 --> 2649.359
sidetracked too many times and you just

2648.88 --> 2653.2000000000003
can't

2649.359 --> 2653.2
get back after some point

2657.119 --> 2663.52
no he's not gonna unban you roger mc

2661.2 --> 2665.1189999999997
that's i don't see that train of thought

2663.52 --> 2667.68
making any sense

2665.119 --> 2668.4
if he did concede he shouldn't no but

2667.68 --> 2672.0
that's not

2668.4 --> 2673.92
why he banned you he banned you

2672.0 --> 2676.24
because you're a dick and you're

2673.92 --> 2679.52
spamming and you're insane

2676.24 --> 2682.56
you're obsessively insane

2679.52 --> 2685.839
obsessive compulsive

2682.56 --> 2687.04
completely desensitized probably very

2685.839 --> 2690.7999999999997
depressed

2687.04 --> 2695.2
on compared to the average and

2690.8 --> 2697.76
yeah he's trying to help you

2695.2 --> 2699.2
by banning you but you are obsessively

2697.76 --> 2701.2000000000003
just come back so

2699.2 --> 2702.3999999999996
you'll stop doing it eventually and

2701.2 --> 2705.68
he'll just

2702.4 --> 2708.48
purely ignore you so

2705.68 --> 2711.68
it doesn't really matter what you think

2708.48 --> 2711.68
or what you think you want

2714.88 --> 2718.56
are there reasons why it happened you

2716.8 --> 2721.8390000000004
don't know you don't know

2718.56 --> 2723.68
anything anymore anything you're just

2721.839 --> 2725.44
literally making it up on the spot

2723.68 --> 2726.7999999999997
because you don't even have the senses

2725.44 --> 2728.7200000000003
left to

2726.8 --> 2731.119
actually figure out what's real you

2728.72 --> 2734.56
don't do that anymore you can't

2731.119 --> 2737.92
it's too painful now so you literally

2734.56 --> 2740.88
make up whatever truth you need

2737.92 --> 2740.88
at the time being

2741.04 --> 2744.319
that's what you're doing you don't even

2742.48 --> 2746.64
know it probably

2744.319 --> 2747.52
because that too is too painful to try

2746.64 --> 2750.96
and realize

2747.52 --> 2753.839
for yourself anyway

2750.96 --> 2754.8
enough about that starting to sound a

2753.839 --> 2758.88
little sadistic

2754.8 --> 2758.88
but it's true everything i said is true

2759.28 --> 2764.8
if you think that's uh that's

2762.72 --> 2766.0
that's too much or whatever then just

2764.8 --> 2770.0
wait in a few years

2766.0 --> 2771.44
you know it's gonna be much worse it's

2770.0 --> 2774.0
still alive

2771.44 --> 2775.119
because people that are that deep into

2774.0 --> 2776.88
such [ __ ] they

2775.119 --> 2778.1600000000003
you know when you slip into the abyss

2776.88 --> 2781.44
eventually your body

2778.16 --> 2789.839
is also dragged with it

2781.44 --> 2789.839
the spirit goes body follows

2794.72 --> 2799.04
yeah it will be very embarrassing to you

2797.04 --> 2803.839
roger mc

2799.04 --> 2803.839
but you are too numb to even realize it

2813.04 --> 2816.24
come on eyes wide shut don't try to get

2815.359 --> 2819.68
real

2816.24 --> 2820.3999999999996
with that [ __ ] he's not listening

2819.68 --> 2823.04
anymore

2820.4 --> 2823.04
you know that

2824.88 --> 2827.92
he's made up his mind

2829.28 --> 2834.96
he thought up the reason made it up out

2832.4 --> 2837.44
of nowhere and now his mind is set

2834.96 --> 2838.88
he's not gonna be listening or dissuaded

2837.44 --> 2840.64
or even trying

2838.88 --> 2845.839
to alter his approach because he's made

2840.64 --> 2845.839
up his mind that's what he's gonna do

2848.079 --> 2851.52
oh wow okay he said he might actually be

2850.88 --> 2859.839
interested

2851.52 --> 2859.839
we'll see

2868.48 --> 2873.839
that is super weird by the way eyes wide

2870.4 --> 2873.839
shut if that's really real

2882.24 --> 2886.5589999999997
yeah it's true though roger mc because

2885.28 --> 2888.6400000000003
what is your story

2886.559 --> 2890.0
what is it you're doing right now you

2888.64 --> 2891.5989999999997
made up

2890.0 --> 2894.48
something that you think is really

2891.599 --> 2897.04
important you're the only one

2894.48 --> 2897.68
that thinks that's important other

2897.04 --> 2900.64
people may

2897.68 --> 2902.3999999999996
tell you they too think it's great

2900.64 --> 2904.48
because they hate you

2902.4 --> 2905.6800000000003
and they want you to kill yourself so

2904.48 --> 2908.72
they're just

2905.68 --> 2910.7999999999997
putting on the gasoline to make you more

2908.72 --> 2914.0
obsessed make you

2910.8 --> 2915.3590000000004
go further away from what is really

2914.0 --> 2917.28
important in your life and that's why

2915.359 --> 2919.839
they're doing that

2917.28 --> 2920.559
right but we we actually care we're

2919.839 --> 2923.68
trying to say

2920.559 --> 2925.3590000000004
look you're completely delusional

2923.68 --> 2928.0
you're getting obsessed over something

2925.359 --> 2932.24
that literally nobody

2928.0 --> 2932.24
in the world cares about at all

2942.4 --> 2959.52
see this guy is clinically insane

2956.97 --> 2962.16
[Music]

2959.52 --> 2964.559
anyway enough about that ruining my

2962.16 --> 2964.5589999999997
hangout

2964.88 --> 2968.559
i'm just going to ignore you now

2968.839 --> 2971.839
uh

2990.48 --> 2999.839
43 watching huh

2993.68 --> 2999.839
not bad

3011.28 --> 3017.599
yeah i write your mc i'm sure

3014.8 --> 3018.319
since you're all yeah you really like

3017.599 --> 3020.88
this

3018.319 --> 3024.4
you like to be exposed for the absolute

3020.88 --> 3027.44
bottom feeder insane person that you are

3024.4 --> 3028.079
uh yeah i think i properly warmed you up

3027.44 --> 3030.079
for uh

3028.079 --> 3033.04
for nathan's show because i'm sure he's

3030.079 --> 3037.599
going to take good care of you

3033.04 --> 3037.599
so yeah i hope you're looking forward to

3038.839 --> 3041.839
that

3053.359 --> 3059.52
electrone what what are you talking

3056.079 --> 3059.52
about clearly i have no idea

3066.96 --> 3072.7200000000003
all right yeah uh oroki maru i've i've

3070.24 --> 3072.72
read that

3076.72 --> 3079.9199999999996
i'm not really convinced though i think

3079.359 --> 3083.839
there's

3079.92 --> 3083.839
many of the such places

3089.839 --> 3092.5589999999997
but who knows

3093.119 --> 3096.2400000000002
you know the thing is every time it's

3094.559 --> 3099.119
brought up with the atlantis again

3096.24 --> 3100.4799999999996
i addressed this yesterday i think it's

3099.119 --> 3102.8
always said just like oh

3100.48 --> 3104.72
it's this it's just this city that's it

3102.8 --> 3107.119
that's atlantis

3104.72 --> 3108.0789999999997
well yeah i'm pretty damn sure that

3107.119 --> 3109.92
whatever

3108.079 --> 3112.96
atlantis really was or where this

3109.92 --> 3116.079
supposed capital city was or where this

3112.96 --> 3118.0
weather device was i'm pretty sure that

3116.079 --> 3120.079
atlanta spent pretty much the entire

3118.0 --> 3123.119
world or the vast majority of it

3120.079 --> 3125.599
maybe another opposing group was also

3123.119 --> 3128.4
there not sure

3125.599 --> 3128.4
probably not

3129.119 --> 3133.92
on the other hand yeah it could have

3132.24 --> 3136.5589999999997
been a united

3133.92 --> 3138.559
kind of multiple kingdom situation as

3136.559 --> 3139.92
well that pretty much was effectively an

3138.559 --> 3141.8390000000004
empire because of

3139.92 --> 3144.96
just the vast technology and

3141.839 --> 3144.96
applications of ill

3145.52 --> 3148.559
pyramids and all that

3150.839 --> 3153.839
giants

3169.359 --> 3175.839
oh wait hey cleary was actually talking

3172.24 --> 3175.839
about a person i didn't see you there

3176.079 --> 3181.8390000000004
cult membership card what the [ __ ]

3182.0 --> 3187.92
okay well electronic three hey uh

3185.359 --> 3189.04
you know you become a member that's the

3187.92 --> 3191.359
memory that's the

3189.04 --> 3193.359
the pass that you were talking about so

3191.359 --> 3195.52
yeah if you wanna do that

3193.359 --> 3198.24
you gotta pay for it it's called the

3195.52 --> 3198.24
join button

3201.92 --> 3209.839
ah here's phoenix here's another baller

3211.28 --> 3213.52
right

3214.96 --> 3223.839
maybe i got it wrong i don't know

3216.24 --> 3223.839
anymore these days i do mix it up

3276.079 --> 3283.76
no she's okay guns have never run rmp

3280.319 --> 3284.4
that sounds extreme are you talking

3283.76 --> 3293.8390000000004
about

3284.4 --> 3293.839
like extreme acceleration

3295.68 --> 3300.0
because that yeah that that seems

3297.52 --> 3300.0
extreme

3301.2 --> 3304.24
just going high speeds doesn't really do

3303.68 --> 3306.0789999999997
well

3304.24 --> 3308.0
yeah exert a lot of forces on you other

3306.079 --> 3311.28
than the shaking

3308.0 --> 3313.359
the air friction on the device but

3311.28 --> 3313.8390000000004
actual acceleration yeah it'll squish

3313.359 --> 3321.839
you

3313.839 --> 3321.839
big time

3322.0 --> 3335.839
oh goody

3364.16 --> 3368.24
all right no guns of nephron i just told

3367.359 --> 3370.72
you

3368.24 --> 3371.68
basically to tell you that i completely

3370.72 --> 3374.3999999999996
understand

3371.68 --> 3376.72
how that works and to tell everybody

3374.4 --> 3378.1600000000003
else i know you know exactly how that

3376.72 --> 3380.0789999999997
works

3378.16 --> 3391.839
you wouldn't be flying a plane like that

3380.079 --> 3391.8390000000004
if you didn't

3394.48 --> 3405.839
it's crazy like

3419.76 --> 3433.8390000000004
hot dogging against protocol i don't

3421.76 --> 3433.8390000000004
know what that means

3445.44 --> 3452.4
the iconic geocentric model no

3449.92 --> 3454.079
i might have seen it at some point but

3452.4 --> 3461.839
now that

3454.079 --> 3461.8390000000004
i'm not familiar with it clearly

3464.079 --> 3468.7200000000003
i might just google that sounds

3466.24 --> 3468.72
interesting

3473.359 --> 3477.2799999999997
okay tyconic system is what is coming

3475.839 --> 3481.52
forth

3477.28 --> 3489.8390000000004
oh that thing right

3481.52 --> 3489.839
it's just basic uh geocentrism right

3498.16 --> 3502.0789999999997
taiko admired aspects of copernicus

3500.319 --> 3504.5589999999997
heliocentric model of the solar system

3502.079 --> 3505.3590000000004
but felt that it had problems as

3504.559 --> 3509.44
concerned

3505.359 --> 3512.24
physics he might have been right

3509.44 --> 3514.16
but he don't think he probably fixed it

3512.24 --> 3516.319
astronomical observations of stars and

3514.16 --> 3519.2799999999997
religion what the

3516.319 --> 3519.2799999999997
that have to do with it

3523.52 --> 3531.2
okay yeah so it's just a

3527.119 --> 3534.559
another model

3531.2 --> 3534.5589999999997
and i had seen it before

3542.64 --> 3546.4
alright hey guns have never owned by the

3544.24 --> 3548.64
way did you did you happen

3546.4 --> 3549.599
since europe did you happen to see

3548.64 --> 3551.1189999999997
flight i

3549.599 --> 3552.7200000000003
talked about it yesterday because they

3551.119 --> 3555.2000000000003
did that there too

3552.72 --> 3556.72
but in a big passenger plane with 102

3555.2 --> 3558.799
people

3556.72 --> 3561.1189999999997
and they really spent time on that scene

3558.799 --> 3564.559
it was pretty amazing

3561.119 --> 3566.48
like they literally just had a plane of

3564.559 --> 3568.079
course in the studio and

3566.48 --> 3569.76
everybody's trapped in and then they

3568.079 --> 3571.3590000000004
rolled it upside down everybody was

3569.76 --> 3572.0
hanging in their seat belts and all that

3571.359 --> 3575.2
it was pretty

3572.0 --> 3575.2
impressive to see that [ __ ]

3577.839 --> 3582.24
i like wonder about the technicals of it

3580.319 --> 3584.96
if you could confirm

3582.24 --> 3586.16
that the situation that is forwarded in

3584.96 --> 3588.559
that movie

3586.16 --> 3589.52
that that is legitimate like what he did

3588.559 --> 3593.0400000000004
was actually

3589.52 --> 3595.2
really based on historical technical

3593.04 --> 3596.4
things concerning those airplanes and

3595.2 --> 3598.0
flying them though

3596.4 --> 3599.839
because i don't know i don't know how to

3598.0 --> 3602.559
confirm that

3599.839 --> 3602.5589999999997
you might know

3608.16 --> 3615.839
it's reality but flat what are you

3610.559 --> 3615.8390000000004
talking about

3616.559 --> 3624.1600000000003
clearing the

3619.92 --> 3627.76
no no pretty damn certain that the

3624.16 --> 3631.04
heavenly bodies are not balls

3627.76 --> 3634.559
flying in proximity to

3631.04 --> 3636.799
the ball earth or even a flat earth

3634.559 --> 3636.799
