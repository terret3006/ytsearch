418.4 --> 422.71999999999997
um addressing people in the

425.24 --> 430.84000000000003
USA I mean I started saying good morning

428.56 --> 434.17
with the early word show since the first

430.84 --> 437.339
time so that's just what I say

434.17 --> 437.339
[Music]

448.319 --> 453.03900000000004
duper

450.759 --> 453.039
all

472.16 --> 475.29900000000004
[Music]

478.319 --> 481.319
right

501.159 --> 507.0
right so how is my channel now that it's

504.4 --> 509.79999999999995
adree hope you're all appreciating the

507.0 --> 513.12
ad freeness of it

509.8 --> 514.9590000000001
I mean I'm not super happy about it but

513.12 --> 518.12
I mean at least nobody's going to get

514.959 --> 520.4789999999999
any ads while watching my show so I

518.12 --> 522.399
guess that's that that's an advantage to

520.479 --> 525.399
the

522.399 --> 525.399
disadvantage

538.2 --> 547.0400000000001
right when did I decide not to get a

542.12 --> 547.04
haircut uh when I was

548.959 --> 555.399
12 but it's yeah my like everybody my

553.88 --> 558.0
family had long

555.399 --> 558.839
hair like it was just a thing we're kind

558.0 --> 562.279
of

558.839 --> 564.2
hippie-ish and so like I wanted it to

562.279 --> 566.4399999999999
especially because at the wal Turf

564.2 --> 572.48
school where I was

566.44 --> 575.44
at like you weren't allowed to sort of

572.48 --> 578.48
so I was like basically getting long

575.44 --> 578.48
hair for me was

591.48 --> 598.12
Rebellion hey here we go again have they

594.519 --> 601.12
demonetized you yeah

598.12 --> 601.12
yesterday

603.16 --> 606.6
still have side hair

616.72 --> 623.64
okay

618.64 --> 626.079

623.64 --> 630.6
[Music]

626.079 --> 633.079
duper Los bardos yeah dude my channel is

630.6 --> 633.0790000000001
getting

633.32 --> 640.1600000000001
like trimmed

636.8 --> 643.8
down many American viewers hello Boston

640.16 --> 643.8
Mander yeah I think

652.079 --> 659.8389999999999
so it would also make somewhat sense

655.32 --> 662.48
since my accent in English is more

659.839 --> 662.48
American

669.0 --> 673.32
oriented it's really only through like

671.399 --> 676.04

that's usually when the troll comes

1109.44 --> 1112.28
piling in

1126.559 --> 1131.6789999999999

1280.6 --> 1290.039

1284.96 --> 1290.039
harmful content extremely non-specific

1307.72 --> 1315.0
they call me bald yeah no it's it's

1310.96 --> 1315.0
projection duper it's mostly

1317.039 --> 1320.039
projection

1345.0 --> 1351.6
but yeah I don't it's like I'm I'm just

1348.76 --> 1354.2

1424.32 --> 1431.8799999999999
the that b makes you go Bal maybe yeah I

1428.64 --> 1431.88
mean I've heard of

1433.4 --> 1438.0
that getting a kid and them like keeping

1436.52 --> 1439.72
you awake and all that it it it

1438.0 --> 1443.679
certainly doesn't

1439.72 --> 1443.679
help so but I

1445.08 --> 1451.039
mean it's terrible they did that not

1447.88 --> 1454.44
really here we go again not

1451.039 --> 1458.44
really I already explained this like

1454.44 --> 1459.76
years ago too cuz I'm on welfare how

1458.44 --> 1463.96
dare you

1459.76 --> 1466.399
Arwin so I report it what I get from

1463.96 --> 1468.44
Google I report and then they basically

1466.399 --> 1472.559
take it out of the check so I don't

1468.44 --> 1474.799
actually get anything out of it maybe

1472.559 --> 1477.72
like less than

1474.799 --> 1481.8799999999999
1% it's it's ridiculous right it would

1477.72 --> 1481.88
only matter if my channel was

1484.12 --> 1492.1589999999999
like 20 to 30 times the size and I'd get

1488.559 --> 1496.76
that much and then it'd be like enough

1492.159 --> 1500.3990000000001
to basically surpass the welfare and

1496.76 --> 1503.2
then and then like it would really

1500.399 --> 1505.6
matter but my channel is so small it's

1503.2 --> 1509.679
just I never really got anything out of

1505.6 --> 1512.279
it that I could that was worth it anyway

1509.679 --> 1515.159
and I don't my channels grows very slow

1512.279 --> 1517.279
I was already like on chains for a while

1515.159 --> 1520.0390000000002
and now they're cracking down on me so I

1517.279 --> 1522.32
don't I mean seriously guys it could

1520.039 --> 1525.48
just be that my one day my channels just

1522.32 --> 1528.6789999999999
deleted all of a sudden so I'm giving

1525.48 --> 1531.84
you a heads up and I wouldn't be doing

1528.679 --> 1531.8400000000001
that but it could just

1535.24 --> 1540.88
happen trolls are desperate

1538.64 --> 1546.039
yes now I

1540.88 --> 1548.0800000000002
am I am beloved by some but really hated

1546.039 --> 1550.48
by a whole bunch of people too they

1548.08 --> 1554.36
can't stand it they can't stand what I

1550.48 --> 1556.559
do and I don't know why they just obsess

1554.36 --> 1558.4399999999998
over me like that and have to come back

1556.559 --> 1560.48
I mean is that is that what you do with

1558.44 --> 1564.159
your

1560.48 --> 1568.3990000000001
life visit people you hate on a daily

1645.52 --> 1653.48
thing talking about which he like this

1650.0 --> 1656.44
amazing uh Saturn night

1653.48 --> 1657.919
lifestyle skit that lasted pretty long

1657.919 --> 1662.0800000000002
hilarious anybody see that yesterday I

1660.6 --> 1666.36
mean that was

1662.08 --> 1666.36
amazing just try to laugh at it I

1668.279 --> 1675.44
do I either just get it really annoyed

1671.96 --> 1675.44
or I'm just like

1676.519 --> 1679.519
whatever

1680.399 --> 1684.399
I mean some things just never really

1682.159 --> 1689.3200000000002
change I had the same [ __ ] like even

1684.399 --> 1689.32
when I was a pre-teen at the same [ __ ]

1689.399 --> 1694.84
man like half of the class would like

1692.159 --> 1698.279
really hate me and try to

1694.84 --> 1701.6789999999999
like fool me and lure me in a trap and

1698.279 --> 1704.36
all kinds of [ __ ] even back then so it's

1701.679 --> 1709.44
like yeah that's just unfortunately

1704.36 --> 1709.4399999999998
that's the response I get to my being

1728.72 --> 1731.44
fourth on

1735.36 --> 1741.4799999999998
awesome super chat suck any

1739.2 --> 1744.2
anyway I mean if your Channel's big

1741.48 --> 1744.2
enough they're just

1746.36 --> 1753.519
great but my channel isn't big enough

1748.919 --> 1756.919
but I mean look if I get taken

1753.519 --> 1758.36
down or whatever I'm going to try to

1756.919 --> 1760.7990000000002
move over

1758.36 --> 1763.9189999999999
to

1760.799 --> 1766.32
rumble because I think on Rumble doing

1763.919 --> 1769.3200000000002
what I do shouldn't be a

1766.32 --> 1769.32
problem

1771.24 --> 1777.279
right I've already did a test stream

1774.08 --> 1778.8799999999999
yesterday as I said I would didn't know

1777.279 --> 1781.84
yeah nobody tuned in though that was a

1778.88 --> 1781.8400000000001
bit disappointing

1787.08 --> 1795.48
but it would be pretty cool if you guys

1790.12 --> 1795.4799999999998
would actually subscribe to me

1796.32 --> 1802.36
there

1798.519 --> 1802.36
I got 13 followers

1807.2 --> 1811.559
already it's a bit weird though

1812.08 --> 1818.84
like oh yeah I got

1815.44 --> 1821.48
dupons kill for me

1818.84 --> 1825.32
nice yeah you two have already found

1821.48 --> 1825.32
your way there that's

1826.24 --> 1829.24
cool

1830.88 --> 1835.7600000000002
it's a bit weird though like where is

1833.559 --> 1835.76
the

1850.559 --> 1859.24
stream I don't understand why does it

1853.519 --> 1859.24
have zero views like I don't get it

1883.519 --> 1890.559
all right so this is that test stream on

1885.559 --> 1890.559
Rumble yesterday it's weird though

1891.6 --> 1897.559
like where where is

1894.6 --> 1899.519
it like on my main Channel it doesn't

1897.559 --> 1901.639
show and that's kind of weird I don't

1899.519 --> 1901.639
get

1912.6 --> 1917.0
it but maybe it's because it's like a

1915.08 --> 1919.8799999999999
sub Channel I'm not entirely sure like

1917.0 --> 1919.88
how how that worked

1923.44 --> 1929.0800000000002
even my stream is on your other channel

1927.2 --> 1931.6390000000001
the one with the

1929.08 --> 1933.6
selfie I guess it's like a sub Channel I

1931.639 --> 1935.76
don't I don't fully understand how

1933.6 --> 1939.9599999999998
Rumble works is is kind of weird to me

1935.76 --> 1942.84
and yeah I guess I might have to like

1939.96 --> 1945.039
load some watch some videos or something

1942.84 --> 1945.039
about

1946.08 --> 1949.08
it

1951.72 --> 1956.0
it would be kind of cool if I had

1954.12 --> 1960.5189999999998
somebody that would like know more about

1956.0 --> 1963.36
it to help me out but uh yeah I mean I

1960.519 --> 1966.84
don't at this time and just going to

1963.36 --> 1966.84

man

4718.96 --> 4724.8
yes the one I know I specifically made

4721.679 --> 4726.88

4724.8 --> 4729.96
know anything about the technicals about

4726.88 --> 4733.4800000000005
these things I just intuitively realized

4729.96 --> 4735.719
like that's the only way I could survive

4733.48 --> 4739.599999999999
I mean I don't

4735.719 --> 4741.56
like I've never ever had to do any of

4739.6 --> 4745.2390000000005
this

4741.56 --> 4749.159000000001
okay but like the recent year was just

4745.239 --> 4750.5199999999995
brutal brutal financially like

4749.159 --> 4755.879999999999
everything

4750.52 --> 4760.360000000001
climbed and the income didn't like very

4755.88 --> 4760.36
slowly they cranked it up a little

4761.84 --> 4764.84
but

4781.239 --> 4789.759999999999
I mean dude got me freaking smoking on

4784.48 --> 4789.759999999999
my show I've never even done that it's

4790.76 --> 4794.84
crazy I would never do that

4821.76 --> 4824.76
normally

4849.0 --> 4855.52
is this the first no they have before I

4851.239 --> 4857.239
ignored it it's stupid it's just like I

4855.52 --> 4861.360000000001
couldn't I

4857.239 --> 4864.638999999999
didn't I ignored it it's

4861.36 --> 4866.32
stupid I shouldn't have done that in

4864.639 --> 4869.4400000000005
retrospect it's just that I couldn't

4866.32 --> 4869.44
deal with it man I

4881.639 --> 4884.639
couldn't

4902.48 --> 4907.879999999999
yes Q andp This exactly that's what

4911.639 --> 4917.639
happened like I get the money I get the

4914.76 --> 4920.96
welfare and then by the time like the

4917.639 --> 4922.36
well the actual health insurance bill

4920.96 --> 4925.719
comes

4922.36 --> 4926.759999999999
in like I wouldn't have any more money

4925.719 --> 4931.159
for

4926.76 --> 4933.04
food so I'd have to like I mean

4931.159 --> 4935.679
everybody knows like at the beginning of

4933.04 --> 4937.679
the month typically I I get a little bit

4935.679 --> 4940.56
more desperate for donations and all

4937.679 --> 4940.56
it's because of

4941.239 --> 4944.5599999999995
that you know

4954.719 --> 4957.44
maybe

4959.76 --> 4965.12
maybe dude but I mean with this amount

4962.52 --> 4968.92
it's it's going to be years it's going

4965.12 --> 4968.92
to be years of trying to pay that

4969.12 --> 4975.96
off unless

4971.36 --> 4978.0
somehow I I can enhance my income

4975.96 --> 4983.08
somehow I think I'm going to like have

am definitely now more than ever

6448.48 --> 6454.04
quitting

6450.239 --> 6457.759999999999
cannabis that might make it doable for

6454.04 --> 6460.599
me but I'd still probably need like

6457.76 --> 6462.4800000000005

6700.52 --> 6707.639
money smoking the Cannabis cost me money

6703.639 --> 6707.639
though and I'm quitting on that

6707.96 --> 6714.079
so here's the weird thing I've

6711.119 --> 6718.719
been I've quit for quite a

6714.079 --> 6718.719
while and I'm already noticing the

6727.199 --> 6733.96
difference it's weird man it's weird I

6730.32 --> 6738.239
think that I just really needed

6733.96 --> 6738.2390000000005
it it's the is best

6738.88 --> 6741.88
Hobby

6742.36 --> 6748.639
I don't need we I don't need it anymore

6745.32 --> 6751.84
I changed anyway it's

6748.639 --> 6755.28
like I I talked about this right on

6751.84 --> 6758.28
previous shows it like it doesn't work

6755.28 --> 6758.28
anymore it it

6759.88 --> 6765.400000000001
does for a while it just had more

6762.92 --> 6768.76
detrimental influences than it had any

6765.4 --> 6771.92
good influences and so I just like I

6768.76 --> 6773.68
still got it it just it's in a drawer

6771.92 --> 6785.84
there and I'm not touching

[Music]

6798.76 --> 6801.76
over

6823.8 --> 6827.56
it's just so weird like when when I was

6825.719 --> 6829.76
still like really smoking cannabis it

6827.56 --> 6833.04
was always like I need to smoke before

6829.76 --> 6836.639
before I go to bed kind of

6833.04 --> 6839.5199999999995
thing now it's exactly the

6836.639 --> 6842.36
opposite I quit because every time I

6839.52 --> 6846.320000000001
smoked I would like get panic

6842.36 --> 6848.36
attacks including right before

6846.32 --> 6852.799999999999
bed

6848.36 --> 6857.199
like the last few times every single

6852.8 --> 6857.1990000000005
time no my roommates will not be

6858.679 --> 6861.679

6869.56 --> 6875.4800000000005

6871.719 --> 6875.4800000000005
haven't for over a

6882.719 --> 6886.96

6980.92 --> 6987.52

6987.88 --> 6993.159000000001
influence I'm going to be way more clean

6990.56 --> 6998.96
and with way more clean also becomes

6993.159 --> 6998.96
just like less hassle less

6999.04 --> 7005.88
moodiness my mood overall improved

7001.96 --> 7005.88
pretty dramatically after I quit

7008.48 --> 7011.48
drinking

7019.52 --> 7024.76

7022.0 --> 7027.28

7024.76 --> 7029.0

7075.96 --> 7081.8
like as minimalistic as I

7078.84 --> 7084.599
can not smoking cannabis will certainly

7081.8 --> 7084.599
contribute to

7089.119 --> 7093.639
that I'm going to have to also quit the

7092.159 --> 7097.839999999999
Illuminati

7093.639 --> 7097.84

7098.32 --> 7102.239
expensive

7100.52 --> 7104.280000000001
I will really miss them though but I

7102.239 --> 7107.0
mean I'll just need to stick the

7104.28 --> 7112.199
bread and

7107.0 --> 7115.8
like simple stuff that's just

7112.199 --> 7118.159
cheaper and then I can like work myself

7115.8 --> 7118.159000000001
out of

7123.56 --> 7129.599
it and I'm certain that even without all

7127.28 --> 7134.199
these extras I'll still be able to to do

7129.599 --> 7137.1990000000005

7176.76 --> 7184.119000000001
it every day a 50 Cent croissant is not

7181.0 --> 7186.92
yeah I could get a regular croissant

7184.119 --> 7191.239
maybe Illuminati cant were a lot more

7186.92 --> 7191.2390000000005

7193.199 --> 7199.879999999999

hilarious but it's like it's too

7199.88 --> 7203.56

7203.92 --> 7208.84
no sell them I can't sell

7234.04 --> 7241.239
I get it or I manag to somehow get a job

7237.88 --> 7241.2390000000005
that could get me out of it

7243.48 --> 7247.638999999999
quicker I'm it's definitely going to be

7246.199 --> 7250.04
part of

7247.639 --> 7253.119
conversations but first first like the

7250.04 --> 7257.239
situation has to be arranged so

7253.119 --> 7257.239
that doesn't like blow

7261.36 --> 7267.28
up and then I can like really start to

7265.199 --> 7272.48
seriously work

7267.28 --> 7272.48

7302.4 --> 7307.719
funny as a sort of like saving mode I

7305.679 --> 7311.76
had been saving

7307.719 --> 7313.88
up the act tube filters that I normally

7311.76 --> 7317.159000000001
use for

joints like used them once but then I

7317.159 --> 7322.879999999999
saved them up I got months worth of this

7321.239 --> 7328.04

7370.679 --> 7376.119
like use for cigarettes that I probably

7373.719 --> 7376.119
will be

7397.88 --> 7400.88
smoking

7427.84 --> 7434.400000000001

7430.119 --> 7434.4

7435.36 --> 7441.159
news coffee is not coffee is

7455.199 --> 7460.799999999999
okay b a cup of coffee the first few

7458.04 --> 7460.8
hours of the day

7461.84 --> 7468.2390000000005
well I'm liking like just basic piece of

7466.079 --> 7470.5199999999995
bread with some liver worst and if it's

7468.239 --> 7471.718999999999
there some Rola and it that works really

7470.52 --> 7476.0
well it's

7471.719 --> 7478.679
just some spelled

7476.0 --> 7480.88
bread with liver worst on it which is

7478.679 --> 7484.84
not expensive like I've been doing with

7480.88 --> 7486.76
that one roll for quite some time so

7484.84 --> 7489.88
that seems to work quite

7486.76 --> 7492.92
efficiently and it is very healthy it

7489.88 --> 7494.079
got some it was it took some getting

7492.92 --> 7496.719
used

7494.079 --> 7499.799999999999
to but that works I've been eating that

7496.719 --> 7502.84
for like the last week and it's been

7499.8 --> 7502.84
extremely cost

7504.199 --> 7511.5199999999995
efficient like I've I've even skipped

7507.199 --> 7513.4
like meals like main dinner and all that

7511.52 --> 7515.599
and then just ate some of that and that

7513.4 --> 7520.48
worked that worked for

7515.599 --> 7522.679
me so I have it's it's like my in my my

7520.48 --> 7525.119
subconscious already knew that this was

7522.679 --> 7528.4800000000005
going to happen and I was already like

7525.119 --> 7528.48
saving mode saving

7529.36 --> 7533.5199999999995
mode normally by this time I'd be

7532.199 --> 7536.638999999999
completely

7533.52 --> 7541.0
broke I'm not completely broke right now

7536.639 --> 7541.0
which is like miraculous to me

7541.239 --> 7544.879999999999
like literally

7545.52 --> 7551.079000000001
miraculous red today is gar yeah but

7548.239 --> 7552.678999999999
this is organic bread it's it's good

7551.079 --> 7556.759999999999
quality organic

7552.679 --> 7559.4
bread it's not super cheap but it's very

7556.76 --> 7563.52
much worth it and it is cheaper than

7559.4 --> 7563.5199999999995
like Illuminati so I mean one of those

7563.96 --> 7568.4800000000005
breads is like one and a half Illuminati

7566.8 --> 7573.400000000001
C some but I can

7568.48 --> 7576.839999999999
eat like half to a full week from it

7573.4 --> 7576.839999999999
so it's worth

7577.599 --> 7584.1990000000005
it

7580.48 --> 7587.959999999999
yeah I don't eat cheap shitty sugary

7584.199 --> 7591.558999999999
type bread that's very unhealthy I I I'm

7587.96 --> 7596.0
on an organic only diet I have been

7591.559 --> 7596.0
for God 20 years or something

7607.599 --> 7610.599
now

7637.52 --> 7640.52
for

7666.679 --> 7672.76
right so this is not something my

7669.96 --> 7675.84
watches are used to me smoking but I

7672.76 --> 7677.679
might be doing that

7675.84 --> 7680.159000000001
more just

7677.679 --> 7683.599
tobacco

7680.159 --> 7687.119
though I'm not like an on camera Stoner

7683.599 --> 7687.119000000001
I I refuse to do

7691.84 --> 7696.4400000000005
that I think it's a really bad happen

7694.84 --> 7701.0
Habit to do

7696.44 --> 7704.239
that first time you see me smoke yeah it

7701.0 --> 7706.599
is except for like New Year's the New

7704.239 --> 7707.598999999999
Year stream I also tend to like smoke a

7706.599 --> 7710.599
join or

7707.599 --> 7714.04
whatever and drink a

7710.599 --> 7714.04
beer but

7714.48 --> 7719.799999999999
uh by the way I am feeling better

7727.4 --> 7730.4
now

7733.84 --> 7740.04
I think I might even know a solution I'm

7737.36 --> 7740.04
not sure

7752.88 --> 7759.639
yet BTC yeah Bitcoin is at the alltime

7756.48 --> 7763.638999999999
high it is

7759.639 --> 7763.639
but so are like gold and all

7781.599 --> 7784.599
that

7787.32 --> 7790.32
right

7817.239 --> 7820.239
e

7847.239 --> 7850.239
for

7873.159 --> 7878.4
let's talk about Bitcoin

7875.96 --> 7880.76
really I don't know I'm not really to

7878.4 --> 7884.92
bitcoin I don't really trust it

7880.76 --> 7888.119000000001
it's I'm kind of with Owen Benjamin on

7884.92 --> 7891.1990000000005
it it's like this oh it's worth so much

7888.119 --> 7895.44
but when you actually like try to sell

7891.199 --> 7895.44
it you lose so much of

7898.88 --> 7904.679
it like the only way to have Bitcoin

7902.639 --> 7909.2390000000005
have a lot of value is if you just keep

7904.679 --> 7912.679
it and you don't do anything with it so

7909.239 --> 7915.5199999999995
I personally would never like bet on

7912.679 --> 7915.52
bitcoin like

7936.079 --> 7941.199
that so being sarcas okay

7967.04 --> 7970.04
f

7991.04 --> 7998.239

8670.72 --> 8674.119999999999
so much for sticking with

8674.68 --> 8680.12
me I I know this is not much of a show

8677.84 --> 8683.12
except if you like drama or oh

8680.12 --> 8687.720000000001
somebody's personal life situations then

8683.12 --> 8690.319000000001
this is it right I'm the guy I'm the guy

8687.72 --> 8694.479
that's gonna throw my personal life and

8690.319 --> 8694.479
my emotions right on

8695.0 --> 8701.16
camera but I do

8697.72 --> 8703.76
promise this is not going to be a daily

8701.16 --> 8705.84
thing it hasn't been I mean it's not the

8703.76 --> 8709.24
first time that I have a

8705.84 --> 8709.24
breakdown and I

8709.92 --> 8714.6
recover but thank you all for sticking

8712.399 --> 8714.599999999999
with

8715.88 --> 8718.88
me

8722.96 --> 8725.56
feel a little

8727.04 --> 8733.0
lightheaded would have thought that Q

8729.96 --> 8737.119999999999
would be the hero you needed I'm not

8733.0 --> 8737.12
entirely sure who Q andv is

8738.8 --> 8743.399
actually but he's Dutch I

8745.88 --> 8748.88
guess

8757.8 --> 8760.56
you has some

8767.56 --> 8772.519999999999
videos oh thank you QV I appreciate

8775.8 --> 8778.8
that

8792.42 --> 8795.62
[Music]

8805.8 --> 8811.84
for

8807.96 --> 8815.039999999999
yeah thank you blue de it was just so

8811.84 --> 8816.880000000001
unexpected just if you listen back to

8815.04 --> 8818.84
how the show started it was like the

8816.88 --> 8821.24
best intro I've ever done it was the

8818.84 --> 8824.279
most fluid the most correctly

8821.24 --> 8825.319
pronounced and it's like okay I'm going

8824.279 --> 8829.439
to

8825.319 --> 8832.64
get put Illumanti on in the and I do it

8829.439 --> 8838.720000000001
then my roommate just walks in and like

8832.64 --> 8838.72
hey there's a letter and just boom

8838.76 --> 8845.880000000001
I did not expect

8841.64 --> 8845.88
that it was just the shock of

8846.479 --> 8850.479
it but I mean I

8850.68 --> 8857.0
should yeah it was going to happen at

8853.439 --> 8857.0
some point I knew it was going to

8861.2 --> 8866.960000000001
happen it's great until the mailman shut

8863.88 --> 8869.199999999999
up yeah thought I was going to have like

8866.96 --> 8873.679999999998
a great

8869.2 --> 8873.68
show instead I had kind of a nervous

8874.6 --> 8879.2
[Music]

8877.0 --> 8882.279
breakdown right but I

8879.2 --> 8884.68
mean it's all part of it it's all part

8882.279 --> 8884.68
of my

8891.24 --> 8895.72
life you're expecting something is still

8894.12 --> 8898.960000000001
yeah because I wasn't like really

8895.72 --> 8900.64
consciously expecting it it was like

8898.96 --> 8903.039999999999
yeah I know it's going to happen at some

8900.64 --> 8905.96
point but it's like I've been kind of

8903.04 --> 8908.12
preoccupied with other things not

8905.96 --> 8910.479
that I thought it was going to take

8908.12 --> 8911.960000000001
longer I thought like yeah I'll probably

8910.479 --> 8917.278999999999
hear something about it like in the

8911.96 --> 8917.278999999999
summer or something but no it was

8918.16 --> 8922.479
now like much quicker than I

8922.8 --> 8927.358999999999
thought but I guess that with these

8925.64 --> 8930.439
financially

8927.359 --> 8933.6
difficult situations they get even

8930.439 --> 8933.6
quicker with this kind of

8955.52 --> 8959.319000000001
stuff

8957.84 --> 8962.52
yeah by the way Richard it's kind of

8959.319 --> 8964.72
weird right in the comments you got the

8962.52 --> 8967.16
other

8964.72 --> 8970.039999999999
Richard it seems like that guy's a

8967.16 --> 8973.279
glober but still people think that that

8970.04 --> 8976.279
guy is another sock account of

8973.279 --> 8976.279
you

8984.68 --> 8991.12
weird who thinks that I don't know the

8987.64 --> 8991.119999999999
trolls that commented

9003.16 --> 9007.93
yeah man I'm going to be like freaking

9006.0 --> 9011.129
chain smoking

9007.93 --> 9011.129
[Music]

9015.439 --> 9018.439
today

9022.04 --> 9027.800000000001
so I'm now a little wobbly is probably

9025.84 --> 9031.72
partially due to the coffee but I do

9027.8 --> 9035.16
feel way better than an hour

9031.72 --> 9037.119999999999
ago backup accounts of Richard G right

9035.16 --> 9039.359
no I know you were two different people

9037.12 --> 9041.92
and like the other guy doesn't talk like

9039.359 --> 9044.2
you like you

9041.92 --> 9046.76
talk very

9044.2 --> 9048.640000000001
concisely short sentence is very your

9046.76 --> 9050.960000000001
style that guy is

9048.64 --> 9054.278999999999
like more

9050.96 --> 9056.919999999998
meticulous and more technical oriented

9054.279 --> 9058.04
he's like very careful with how he asks

9056.92 --> 9060.56
the

9058.04 --> 9064.0
questions which made me feel like he's

9060.56 --> 9067.119999999999
probably like a a glober like trying to

9064.0 --> 9069.479
inquire without getting banned but I

9067.12 --> 9073.560000000001
would also like to in

9069.479 --> 9075.599999999999
general make a promise although I don't

9073.56 --> 9077.6
man I could switch around or something

9075.6 --> 9082.640000000001
but I'm going to

9077.6 --> 9086.2
try to not be so damn

9082.64 --> 9086.199999999999
hard on glob

9087.04 --> 9094.12
Believers and more like no they just

9091.359 --> 9097.279
they just believe

9094.12 --> 9098.560000000001
that I I want to be good guys I I want

9097.279 --> 9102.24
to be

9098.56 --> 9104.479
better I've been very passionate in all

9102.24 --> 9107.359
these years very very

9104.479 --> 9111.72
passionate and like f IAL in that way is

9107.359 --> 9113.960000000001
like no you stop it like I will not I

9111.72 --> 9117.599999999999
will not

9113.96 --> 9120.039999999999
be I will not stand for the globe lie

9117.6 --> 9122.68
right I will not tolerate it but I

9120.04 --> 9124.960000000001
mean to this to the actual glob

9122.68 --> 9127.880000000001
Believers it's not a lie to

9124.96 --> 9129.64
them they're just really stuck in it

9127.88 --> 9131.8
it's not like the I mean the trolls are

9129.64 --> 9134.96
just the trolls and I will just like

9131.8 --> 9137.358999999999
kick them out and all that but you can I

9134.96 --> 9139.278999999999
can much more clearly see the difference

9137.359 --> 9142.16
now between trolls and just genuine

9139.279 --> 9144.880000000001
Globe Believers in general maybe it's

9142.16 --> 9147.88
because I'm not smoking cannabis

9144.88 --> 9150.72
anymore I mean the canis did kind of

9147.88 --> 9154.278999999999
like make me more overgeneralize it it

9150.72 --> 9154.278999999999
is I'm just noticing

9165.24 --> 9168.24
that

9168.319 --> 9175.0
right and in similar

9170.72 --> 9175.0
ways also with

9175.56 --> 9181.319
Christians like the the typical

9177.88 --> 9183.119999999999
Christian Believers I mean the ones that

9181.319 --> 9186.439
are just like

9183.12 --> 9188.279
hey like oh if you don't believe this

9186.439 --> 9192.68
then you're of the devil like that's

9188.279 --> 9195.560000000001
just ridiculous but like I don't want

9192.68 --> 9199.16
to like you can believe those things and

9195.56 --> 9201.84
like live a good Christian Life like

9199.16 --> 9204.96
really do your best really try to

9201.84 --> 9208.08
follow Christ's advice

9204.96 --> 9210.08
Etc and still believe like the Trinity

9208.08 --> 9212.399
and that you must believe it or the

9210.08 --> 9214.84
weird esoteric stuff that's come come

9212.399 --> 9214.84
out of the

9219.399 --> 9225.0
priesthood I want to be more taller I

9221.96 --> 9225.0
want to be more

9225.16 --> 9228.16
reasonable

9230.96 --> 9239.119999999999
or as the guys at fed said like I really

9235.399 --> 9242.199999999999
want to grow up I really do I mean it

9239.12 --> 9244.160000000002
wasn't nice of them it would like in a

9242.2 --> 9248.279
way was

9244.16 --> 9251.439
like not really their place to tell me

9248.279 --> 9255.08
that but I do

9251.439 --> 9258.08
feel that I can and

9255.08 --> 9258.08
should

9259.16 --> 9265.76
like grow up in

9262.64 --> 9268.599999999999
like dealing with my emotions and my

9265.76 --> 9270.880000000001
judgment of other people I I do feel I

9268.6 --> 9273.92
need to and I it would probably be

9270.88 --> 9277.759999999998
better too and it's not like I'm going

9273.92 --> 9280.0
to scare you all away right cuz the guys

9277.76 --> 9282.439
that are now with me you are already

9280.0 --> 9284.56
kind of like that and I get the feeling

9282.439 --> 9286.880000000001
that you've all just been waiting for me

9284.56 --> 9291.0
to like get

9286.88 --> 9293.438999999998
there where you're at CU you guys are

9291.0 --> 9293.439
very

9293.52 --> 9299.960000000001
wise I feel that like yeah I got smarts

9297.16 --> 9302.399
I got like really Crystal Clear insights

9299.96 --> 9305.399
sometimes I'm good at

9302.399 --> 9305.399
explaining

9309.24 --> 9314.56
but I just have this natural tendencies

9312.24 --> 9317.359
to just choose passion choose a

9314.56 --> 9320.439
passionate response

9317.359 --> 9320.439
and not so much

9321.439 --> 9328.76
wise and I want to be wiser I want to be

9325.319 --> 9330.68
wiser I really mean it I need it I've

9328.76 --> 9332.68
gotten myself into

9330.68 --> 9337.92
trouble with

9332.68 --> 9342.6
it it's caused me a lot of pain it's

9337.92 --> 9346.76
like I've put myself onto a pedestal of

9342.6 --> 9348.479000000001
like I have I have the smart so I can be

9346.76 --> 9350.08
rude and all

9348.479 --> 9353.519999999999
that

9350.08 --> 9357.2
and that would work if I was really like

9353.52 --> 9361.68
a tough nut like you couldn't get to me

9357.2 --> 9365.399000000001
emotionally but I but I am not that I am

9361.68 --> 9371.04
not really that tough I mean I can

9365.399 --> 9371.039999999999
be emergency tough in a

9371.319 --> 9376.76
moment

9373.76 --> 9378.76
but drop the flut Earth

9376.76 --> 9381.399
and then what day and night then what

9378.76 --> 9381.399
then what do I

9390.96 --> 9394.679999999998
do what is that going to

9395.359 --> 9401.56
help dude if I drop the Flat Earth from

9398.479 --> 9404.88
my show first off it would then suddenly

9401.56 --> 9407.278999999999
be broken up it's no longer

9404.88 --> 9410.599999999999
consistent

9407.279 --> 9413.2
and you think that the trolls will stop

9410.6 --> 9416.399000000001
trolling me about my flat Earth

9413.2 --> 9419.76
past there's no

9416.399 --> 9422.72
way and I'm not going to like stop

9419.76 --> 9422.72
referencing it

9433.64 --> 9438.68
either right I mean

9436.56 --> 9440.72
the trolls at this point should be happy

9438.68 --> 9443.0
that I'm not just like continually

9440.72 --> 9444.84
talking about Flat Earth and reviewing

9443.0 --> 9448.2
anti flat earthers and talking [ __ ]

9444.84 --> 9450.319
about that right I don't do that I don't

9448.2 --> 9454.720000000001
like doing that I

9450.319 --> 9458.6
don't really like I've grown very tired

9454.72 --> 9458.599999999999
of other flat earthers that do

9464.8 --> 9467.8
that

9490.9 --> 9494.09
[Music]

9494.72 --> 9499.399
for

9496.52 --> 9499.399000000001
like if I

9500.08 --> 9506.16
change my

9502.24 --> 9508.84
show first off if I'd like take the Flat

9506.16 --> 9508.84
Earth out

9509.08 --> 9515.399
like well the entire setup now would

9512.319 --> 9515.399
then like even my

9515.92 --> 9519.76
logo it has it in

9522.6 --> 9528.6
there like I'm quite happy with the

9525.96 --> 9532.199999999999
setup that I have

9528.6 --> 9536.12
now and I don't I don't

9532.2 --> 9538.279
know how to replace that like if I'd

9536.12 --> 9541.12
replace it it would effectively be a

9538.279 --> 9544.12
downgrade and that's a

9541.12 --> 9545.68
fact and I don't want to do that and

9544.12 --> 9548.84
besides there are still things

9545.68 --> 9552.0
considering or concerning Flat Earth

9548.84 --> 9556.479
that I want to discuss and

9552.0 --> 9559.2
clarify especially about like the

9556.479 --> 9562.438999999998
standard Flat Earth dis

9559.2 --> 9564.640000000001
assumers like I think they're

9562.439 --> 9568.960000000001
mistaken I think that

9564.64 --> 9568.96
they're buying into like an

9569.279 --> 9574.960000000001
overgeneralized

9571.279 --> 9576.640000000001
concept that is like incorrect in ways

9574.96 --> 9580.039999999999
and I don't want to

9576.64 --> 9581.96
like stick to that specifically and it's

9580.04 --> 9583.84
kind of the reason why it's not just oh

9581.96 --> 9587.08
Flat Earth oh here's my

9583.84 --> 9589.92
model I but I have ideas I have ideas

9587.08 --> 9592.039999999999
about it that I've had for a long time

9589.92 --> 9593.2
that I've over the course of my show

9592.04 --> 9596.560000000001
been able

9593.2 --> 9600.720000000001
to to put

9596.56 --> 9605.92
down like how to and what could it be

9600.72 --> 9610.16
and like that's an important part of my

9605.92 --> 9610.16
intellectual Legacy

9611.279 --> 9614.279
here

9614.56 --> 9617.56
right

9621.52 --> 9625.800000000001
yeah it's called f flatter of the r bir

9623.479 --> 9625.8
that's

9644.52 --> 9647.52
right

9656.319 --> 9662.278999999999
I am the fly Earth every bird and this

9658.439 --> 9662.279
is my Nest

9674.439 --> 9677.439
yeah

9690.319 --> 9695.76
do I have additional streams of

9692.76 --> 9695.76
income

9704.439 --> 9707.439
no

9726.68 --> 9732.399
dig around on the internet see what

9728.439 --> 9732.399
folks are talking about

9734.359 --> 9737.359
yeah

9740.76 --> 9745.279
well I do do

9742.24 --> 9747.64
that but I haven't been like super

9745.279 --> 9750.76
consistent with

9747.64 --> 9754.72
it but now that

9750.76 --> 9758.12
like my overall day is like transforming

9754.72 --> 9760.479
because I don't smoke like I used to Etc

9758.12 --> 9764.359
and

9760.479 --> 9767.358999999999
like yeah I'm going to

9764.359 --> 9767.359
try

9773.319 --> 9778.519999999999
and I do also want to like get more

9775.279 --> 9781.08
General subjects involved and like

9778.52 --> 9784.0
references

9781.08 --> 9785.92
to like more political things that are

9784.0 --> 9788.92
happening I also want to discuss that

9785.92 --> 9788.92
when I'm ready for

9794.279 --> 9797.279
it

9801.76 --> 9805.12
hey still

9822.52 --> 9829.16
watching Spirit make an interesting than

9825.279 --> 9829.16
thank you Ben Johnson

9829.319 --> 9832.92
John I do my

9835.84 --> 9839.92
best like if I'm going to share

9838.52 --> 9842.84
something with you

9839.92 --> 9846.0
guys it has to be good enough and

9842.84 --> 9850.72
interesting enough for me and I have a

9846.0 --> 9850.72
pretty high standard as to what I find

9854.2 --> 9857.640000000001
interesting

9855.92 --> 9859.76
right if it's not interesting enough

9857.64 --> 9862.358999999999
I'll just like mention it and then it'll

9859.76 --> 9864.279
just drop off and it will have taken

9862.359 --> 9866.68
like 30 seconds and everybody would move

9864.279 --> 9866.68
on

9869.84 --> 9875.6
so explation of the Mandela effect best

9872.92 --> 9875.6
ever heard

9875.96 --> 9879.759999999998
thanks well debatable

9881.479 --> 9890.64
d right and I mean that Mandela effect

9884.88 --> 9890.64
is affecting me in a very personal way

9894.92 --> 9900.319
too not just like with weird products

9898.479 --> 9903.88
out there that suddenly are different

9900.319 --> 9905.96
than I had anticipated but like with

9903.88 --> 9908.92
personal life

9905.96 --> 9911.119999999999
things

9908.92 --> 9913.76
like

9911.12 --> 9918.800000000001
situations that are like

9913.76 --> 9921.6
so so real to me that I just I forget

9918.8 --> 9923.358999999999
about it and it's happened to me in the

9921.6 --> 9926.880000000001
past

9923.359 --> 9929.399000000001
too like I can just point at it like how

9926.88 --> 9931.199999999999
that that that

9929.399 --> 9935.599999999999
happened

9931.2 --> 9939.68
like it happened with the Jesuit guy way

9935.6 --> 9941.479000000001
back who would basically do and say

9939.68 --> 9945.720000000001
horrible

9941.479 --> 9951.16
things very mean things and I would just

9945.72 --> 9955.24
forget it genuinely forget it and like

9951.16 --> 9958.84
just thought like no he's my friend like

9955.24 --> 9960.84
what and that and that like lasted that

9958.84 --> 9965.16
forgetfulness would

9960.84 --> 9971.0
last like a decade a

9965.16 --> 9973.76
decade I would just not remember the

9971.0 --> 9978.359
details it's very

9973.76 --> 9980.64
strange but it is like exactly like the

9978.359 --> 9983.359
Mandela effect it's just like no you

9980.64 --> 9983.358999999999
remember it

9986.52 --> 9990.84
differently because the real thing in

9988.68 --> 9991.92
ways was so out of place that you just

9990.84 --> 9996.0
it didn't

9991.92 --> 9996.0
stick couldn't make it

10004.0 --> 10007.0
fit

10009.88 --> 10014.16
no W working going I don't want to do

10011.72 --> 10019.399
that sort of thing I've never done

10014.16 --> 10022.64
it breakdown of other videos I've never

10019.399 --> 10022.64
done that it's not my

10033.92 --> 10036.92
thing

10050.319 --> 10054.0
get out into the mainstream

10063.92 --> 10066.92
what

10094.319 --> 10100.439
yeah Rich G I mean but

10098.88 --> 10102.278999999999
no

10100.439 --> 10104.92
though

10102.279 --> 10109.0
i' like years ago that would have been

10104.92 --> 10112.04
logical but now it's like I would feel

10109.0 --> 10115.08
really weird if I couldn't do my stream

10112.04 --> 10115.080000000002
like I need

10123.8 --> 10126.8
this

10131.52 --> 10136.76
especially in tough times I need it I

10136.8 --> 10142.8
because I want I want to be seen I like

10140.92 --> 10145.399
even if I'm like uncomfortable then I

10142.8 --> 10147.84
need to share that I I need to share it

10145.399 --> 10147.84
with you

10147.88 --> 10153.319
guys so that you're just up to date at

10151.24 --> 10157.76
how it's going with

10153.319 --> 10157.76
me that's why I'm sharing all

10163.279 --> 10166.279
this

10179.439 --> 10186.239
right you have addition Yes W working gy

10183.72 --> 10189.239
bear

10186.239 --> 10192.8
but I don't know how to do that

10189.239 --> 10197.08
yet like the way that I'm doing my show

10192.8 --> 10198.679999999998
here is it's not suitable for mainstream

10197.08 --> 10201.319
it just

10198.68 --> 10203.12
isn't and to really adapt to that I

10201.319 --> 10206.84
don't think I could do

10203.12 --> 10208.960000000001
it like it wouldn't feel like me it

10206.84 --> 10213.8
would be tough on me

10208.96 --> 10216.56
and it would yeah it maybe as a side

10213.8 --> 10220.199999999999
project or whatever ever

10216.56 --> 10223.479
but I mean YouTube is no longer

10220.2 --> 10223.479000000001
monetized anyway for

10243.64 --> 10246.64
me

10271.16 --> 10275.359
side hustle yeah but the problem is

10272.92 --> 10278.8
woodworking gy bear is that

10275.359 --> 10282.319
I'm still on social welfare it's like I

10278.8 --> 10282.319
I don't know how to do

10298.64 --> 10307.96
that it's this and just keep going or

10304.92 --> 10309.76
somehow figure out how to get a job and

10307.96 --> 10312.0
then it would be just a couple of

10309.76 --> 10314.12
streams on the side

10312.0 --> 10316.319
perhaps and that would be the best I

10314.12 --> 10316.319000000001
could

10333.479 --> 10336.479
do

10363.439 --> 10366.439
for

10406.8 --> 10411.88
but I mean yeah would work if at some

10409.279 --> 10415.239
point I find some kind of thing that I

10411.88 --> 10415.239
can do on the side and

10415.84 --> 10420.239
just I don't

10417.64 --> 10424.0
know keep that off the Record or

10420.239 --> 10426.96
something I don't know then maybe maybe

10424.0 --> 10432.88
that will be be doable but I mean I'm

10426.96 --> 10432.88
kind of nervous about even trying to do

10453.279 --> 10456.279
that

10470.04 --> 10477.319000000001
my streams are always so damn long these

10473.04 --> 10477.319000000001
days ring for almost three

10483.279 --> 10486.279
hours

10506.68 --> 10511.359
allowed to make additional income well

10509.319 --> 10513.199999999999
you are but you have to report it and

10511.359 --> 10516.960000000001
then they like

10513.2 --> 10516.960000000001
take most of it

10543.2 --> 10548.59
out

10545.46 --> 10548.589999999998
