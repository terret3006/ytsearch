129.39 --> 135.20899999999997
yeah it's it is really starting to feel

133.62 --> 137.19
a little bit more like springtime and

135.209 --> 140.28
there's a couple of blooming trees here

137.19 --> 142.53
and they're not in direct line-of-sight

140.28 --> 150.95

city wide blossoming trees but yeah

it's not very it's not that windy over

156.89 --> 164.72
here just a little but anyway yeah the

162.41 --> 166.22
air is kind of mild so even with the

164.72 --> 171.05
wind that doesn't really matter too much

166.22 --> 172.63
it's not annoying so yeah good morning

185.99 --> 193.46
with just calling my dad and trying to

190.31 --> 197.02
arrange things with finances and stuff

193.46 --> 203.54000000000002

badge badge on a koala did I mention you

257.77 --> 269.83
a Julia Pavan I think I got a matrix

266.86 --> 278.44
media yeah I think he's got everyone he

269.83 --> 281.74
I could see you I was actually going to

278.44 --> 284.46999999999997
have somebody on but now yeah because of

281.74 --> 288.91
my being so late I kind of screwed that

284.47 --> 291.73
up a little it's my bad although I

288.91 --> 297.58000000000004
haven't seen him around right at this

291.73 --> 299.53000000000003
moment so yeah it's some guy contacted

297.58 --> 301.22999999999996
me who was apparently a student of Tom

299.53 --> 307.71999999999997
Parker and he wanted to get on the show

301.23 --> 314.8
and yeah I never talked but I don't see

307.72 --> 316.18
him on right now seems to be a way so

314.8 --> 321.01
that yeah I might have to do that a

316.18 --> 326.65000000000003
little bit later oh well we got green

321.01 --> 332.76
tea mmm man yeah yesterday again was a

326.65 --> 335.32
very busy media night to own Benjamin

332.76 --> 337.93
episodes both were pretty damn good

335.32 --> 341.29
especially the second one which lasted

337.93 --> 343.93
very long oh and apparently somebody

341.29 --> 346.21000000000004
gave me a subscription to his D life so

343.93 --> 347.92
that was kind of nice I said just

346.21 --> 349.63
thought yeah you know what I'll type

347.92 --> 353.62
something to see if it's like an open

349.63 --> 356.02
chat and I turned out to be able to

353.62 --> 357.58
to comment even with subscribers only so

356.02 --> 364.15
thank you whoever did did that I don't

357.58 --> 367.32
know I didn't see it happen right Tom

364.15 --> 370.59999999999997
Parker yeah that's the one

367.32 --> 377.89
all right it that's him okay that's

370.6 --> 380.41
interesting yeah that makes sense yeah

377.89 --> 382.36
he contacted me on skype yesterday

380.41 --> 389.77000000000004
evening and had a bit of a talk

382.36 --> 394.84000000000003
oh yeah AGM I saw that too he was being

389.77 --> 397.71
a complaint he pants about it that was

394.84 --> 397.71
kind of a silly

400.18 --> 406.03000000000003
well that yeah technically he did make

402.67 --> 408.64000000000004
some interesting observations but it was

406.03 --> 413.53
kind of silly that he did that that he

408.64 --> 416.97999999999996
would make such a fuss about it yeah Tom

413.53 --> 419.55999999999995
Parker I know I he sound or Yap from

416.98 --> 421.77000000000004
what I when he rewrote he sound a pretty

419.56 --> 421.77
good

427.06 --> 435.0
[Music]

428.88 --> 435.0
hello son Mao what question please Oh

438.03 --> 442.89
pumpkin here hey pumpkin

470.169 --> 477.21
I don't know I I got I caught that part

474.099 --> 481.96
but I didn't really continue watching I

477.21 --> 485.00899999999996
went on to watch Alec I mean yeah Owen

481.96 --> 488.83
Benjamin went my life with this first

485.009 --> 492.659
stream of the day pretty soon after so I

488.83 --> 492.659
switched to that was a lot more fun

500.47 --> 503.88000000000005
what else did I do

505.37 --> 511.22
and yesterday on the debates was a good

507.949 --> 515.3000000000001
show anyway for some reason I was kind

511.22 --> 522.02
of on a roll I can't even explain it I I

515.3 --> 523.52
sometimes just do things and then I just

522.02 --> 526.64
don't really understand even how it

523.52 --> 528.68
works then again I'm not a professional

526.64 --> 530.4499999999999
comedian but sometimes apparently I make

528.68 --> 532.01
jokes and they would just work perfectly

530.45 --> 533.63
in Everybody bursts they're laughing and

532.01 --> 535.4
other times I make jokes that it doesn't

533.63 --> 537.77
work on everybody just stays silent that

535.4 --> 541.4
I don't know why I don't understand how

537.77 --> 546.26
it works this is I'm just doing

541.4 --> 549.8
something on the spot and I guess

546.26 --> 552.52
yesterday I hit hit the spot pretty well

549.8 --> 552.52
a couple of times

555.04 --> 561.899
[Music]

562.82 --> 569.87
I was own content these days well it is

566.57 --> 572.33
kind of typical he's just carrying on in

569.87 --> 575.6
the train of thought that he's been

572.33 --> 578.59
building in the last few years and it's

575.6 --> 578.59
yeah it's good stuff

579.74 --> 582.929
[Music]

587.41 --> 591.209
when you're talking about a gem

608.46 --> 614.6600000000001
why does everyone talk about others that

611.97 --> 617.82
of concentrating on oneself yeah dad

614.66 --> 622.04
well because if you just talk about

617.82 --> 624.899
yourself only it gets kind of annoying

622.04 --> 628.0699999999999
there besides we learn a lot from

624.899 --> 630.93
reflecting of what others do so that's

628.07 --> 634.98
big part of the reason why people always

630.93 --> 638.4499999999999
talk about other people doesn't always

634.98 --> 638.45
have to be effective though but

647.88 --> 653.81
yeah I did read your question son Mao

650.069 --> 653.81
and I just answered it

680.5 --> 683.62
[Music]

685.77 --> 688.88
[Music]

688.94 --> 695.8900000000001
oh really didn't he now send now are you

693.38 --> 695.89
sure about that

703.52 --> 706.63
how would you know that

732.06 --> 742.29
what is it Emily young what is it with

735.22 --> 742.2900000000001
the wrenches I think you already got one

783.34 --> 792.75
right well son Mao isn't there just a

786.25 --> 792.75
good reason for that you know again

797.31 --> 803.4
but in not all right what what are you

800.05 --> 803.4
saying amending that makes no sense

806.64 --> 812.4399999999999
yeah good serve and don't worry I was

809.17 --> 814.51
late today it's a bit of a I don't know

812.44 --> 818.08
it's it's not gonna be a long show it's

814.51 --> 821.71
not gonna be very special I think it's

818.08 --> 824.32
just a short show me showing up talking

821.71 --> 830.14
a little that's it don't have any big

824.32 --> 835.63
subjects on my mind that ya didn't have

830.14 --> 838.9
any place in here oh you do Mason be

835.63 --> 841.54
well that's too bad because I know that

838.9 --> 843.01
apology is probably conditional and as

841.54 --> 844.63
soon as I say yeah that's not good

843.01 --> 846.49
enough you're just gonna go straight

844.63 --> 853.51
back to that behavior in bad language

846.49 --> 855.49
aren't you think you can think it works

853.51 --> 857.61
that easy after everything that's

855.49 --> 857.61
happened

865.29 --> 868.49
[Music]

871.62 --> 878.82
finally I appreciate the gesture though

875.32 --> 878.82
it's a good start

881.85 --> 886.26
yeah no [ __ ] you've been stressed out

886.35 --> 890.4300000000001
that was blatantly obvious

908.58 --> 912.23
Amen table ended

935.62 --> 942.76
yeah Thank You pumpkin yeah I do my best

938.53 --> 946.93
I know it's my show gets a little bit

942.76 --> 948.6899999999999
more messy because of it too because i

946.93 --> 952.06
reflect a lot among the Chad and

948.69 --> 954.7
basically grow silent just staring at

952.06 --> 957.25
the screen for a while reading things to

954.7 --> 961.24
see if I can get into some kind of

957.25 --> 962.86
question or respond so yeah it does kind

961.24 --> 968.6800000000001
of set the show but I do put a lot of

962.86 --> 972.52
effort into well basically getting a

968.68 --> 974.8599999999999
good classroom atmosphere or everybody

972.52 --> 979.17
focuses on the yeah

974.86 --> 982.45
the right behavior and optimizes the

979.17 --> 987.01
potential for everyone to think along

982.45 --> 988.9000000000001
and figure out things to the best of

987.01 --> 990.73
their abilities so that's what the

988.9 --> 995.4399999999999
effort is for really it's like my

990.73 --> 997.86
classroom that's kind of how I treat my

995.44 --> 997.86
chat

1002.95 --> 1008.5
and yeah I'm kind of satisfied and

1005.05 --> 1012.579
there's a lot of people these days I

1008.5 --> 1016.029
remember like back in the first hundred

1012.579 --> 1017.9499999999999
early bird shows for example that there

1016.029 --> 1021.07
would be a couple of people in and there

1017.95 --> 1022.9300000000001
would be a lot of typical baller trolls

1021.07 --> 1024.309
that would also be part of the Flat

1022.93 --> 1027.25
Earth debates that would try to get in

1024.309 --> 1030.25
my face about my activities on the Flat

1027.25 --> 1033.85
Earth debates a lot and I kind of pushed

1030.25 --> 1037.87
them away because well a lot of genuine

1033.85 --> 1041.79
people since that time have started to

1037.87 --> 1046.36
show up and really follow the show and

1041.79 --> 1052.5
yeah now no everyday multiple people get

1046.36 --> 1052.5
in here and it's good

1061.5 --> 1066.099
[Music]

1077.92 --> 1086.44
okay Mason B so you're a global now

1081.95 --> 1090.14
that's it and you lost all your friends

1086.44 --> 1092.15
because you realized through your study

1090.14 --> 1096.95
of physics that the earth is a globe are

1092.15 --> 1099.71
you serious yeah no wonder you're

1096.95 --> 1101.93
stressed out you literally flip the

1099.71 --> 1111.679
reality in your mind there's no good

1101.93 --> 1117.17
buddy like what at this point would even

1111.679 --> 1126.22
bring you to that conclusion now so

1117.17 --> 1126.22
bizarre yeah I think it is a real one

1127.51 --> 1138.05
because you know I have unblocked him a

1131.63 --> 1144.8600000000001
long time ago I don't know though if it

1138.05 --> 1146.8999999999999
is the real for sure but I don't know

1144.86 --> 1148.61
mason bees youtube account at all

1146.9 --> 1151.2800000000002
because this one doesn't have any

1148.61 --> 1153.5
subscribers that I can see nor content

1151.28 --> 1155.72
but I don't know if mason bee has a

1153.5 --> 1157.88
genuine channel with content I have no

1155.72 --> 1161.1100000000001
idea I know very little about mason bee

1157.88 --> 1165.5900000000001
I just know that he's been behaving

1161.11 --> 1168.309
horrendously or endlessly in the last

1165.59 --> 1168.309
month at least

1171.76 --> 1178.72
hmm okay mark colored well then in that

1175.49 --> 1182.38
case it might be his sock account

1178.72 --> 1185.57
although I think yeah I did go through

1182.38 --> 1187.25
my blood list and did remove him some

1185.57 --> 1190.1599999999999
time ago I even told him but then he

1187.25 --> 1192.95
just wouldn't stop trolling and he

1190.16 --> 1196.3700000000001
wouldn't come back anyway and to be fair

1192.95 --> 1198.47
in the face of how he's behaved in the

1196.37 --> 1209.2299999999998
last month I have not really missed him

1198.47 --> 1212.45
here so see what he does okay pumpkin

1209.23 --> 1217.04
I'll give you a wrench for four for the

1212.45 --> 1219.22
time being so you can post a link if you

1217.04 --> 1219.22
want

1236.8 --> 1242.98
all right yakumo virus yeah yeah that's

1240.4 --> 1246.76
right you you are blocked because she

1242.98 --> 1250.33
behaved like a complete got the dweller

1246.76 --> 1255.43
at some point and typically don't allow

1250.33 --> 1258.84
that here but that's alright thank you

1255.43 --> 1258.8400000000001
for being nice

1275.82 --> 1279.8
good seven what are you talking about

1290.06 --> 1293.9199999999998
that's not to ruin okay

1300.13 --> 1309.89
Tyler McAfee am I ever going to in band

1302.87 --> 1312.4899999999998
my list no freakin way there's like 500

1309.89 --> 1318.3700000000001
banned soccer counts in there

1312.49 --> 1322.58
it's no way I'm gonna in ban all of that

1318.37 --> 1325.2199999999998
because they will all come back don't

1322.58 --> 1327.59
think that these soccer counts get

1325.22 --> 1335.66
deleted no they just get put on hold and

1327.59 --> 1337.8999999999999
reused then less youtube deletes them at

1335.66 --> 1337.9
some point

1348.8 --> 1352.349
[Music]

1352.419 --> 1361.779
hmm now AGM I missed out on that part I

1357.129 --> 1365.649
did I did hear there was something about

1361.779 --> 1367.779
it what is it the the CPAC thing with

1365.649 --> 1370.899
Nick Fuentes but I didn't really follow

1367.779 --> 1373.749
it because that stuff just I think it's

1370.899 --> 1380.2489999999998
kind of boring it's not really my it's

1373.749 --> 1380.249
not my country it's just not my thing

1388.85 --> 1393.9089999999999
okay thanks pumpkin checkout your link

1399.03 --> 1402.1499999999999
[Music]

1405.51 --> 1414.6
okay that's a halo what is it

1422.1 --> 1435.1499999999999
it seems like in editor or something

1427.58 --> 1439.56
yeah okay right so it's a halo 5 map

1435.15 --> 1443.4
editor thing video I guess

1439.56 --> 1445.44
and yeah it's a safe to say that the

1443.4 --> 1451.02
model they use is a pretty damn well

1445.44 --> 1454.91
flat model earth and it has to look real

1451.02 --> 1454.91
because otherwise it just looks fake

1456.14 --> 1461.3300000000002
moon part in space

1467.16 --> 1474.0
it came it looks pretty good though

1469.61 --> 1476.7299999999998
visualize hmm

1474.0 --> 1478.73
so yeah thanks for that link was there

1476.73 --> 1481.73
any specific point you wanted to make

1478.73 --> 1481.73
pumpkin

1490.75 --> 1500.62
yeah yeah of course they know it's you

1498.53 --> 1503.23
come on you have to get real here like

1500.62 --> 1509.03
everyone that is not compartmentalized

1503.23 --> 1512.8700000000001
away from interpret knowledge it's not

1509.03 --> 1515.47
just some tool in a corporation a

1512.87 --> 1519.32
everyone that actually has access to

1515.47 --> 1522.8600000000001
things you need to make things look real

1519.32 --> 1525.32
to build things to do architecture all

1522.86 --> 1528.83
that yeah of course they know of course

1525.32 --> 1531.2
they know they all know oh you have to

1528.83 --> 1534.23
you if you don't then you're just gonna

1531.2 --> 1535.73
get stuck so you have to where do you

1534.23 --> 1538.21
truly understand the widespread

1535.73 --> 1543.38
implications of that is another matter

1538.21 --> 1547.42
they know you have to you can't do

1543.38 --> 1547.42
things properly if you don't

1556.75 --> 1561.46
[Music]

1558.27 --> 1564.15
but yeah you know people's might get

1561.46 --> 1568.06
twists in all kinds of way so even if

1564.15 --> 1571.39
some like for example 3d engine builder

1568.06 --> 1574.33
would know like yeah you build it like a

1571.39 --> 1577.23
giant box and the earth has to be flat

1574.33 --> 1580.4499999999998
otherwise individuals don't work well

1577.23 --> 1584.92
potentially if he was this intercut

1580.45 --> 1586.69
baller math math holic as it were then

1584.92 --> 1588.3700000000001
he could still in his mind twisted

1586.69 --> 1590.26
around say okay yeah that's just because

1588.37 --> 1592.6
of officials in the game but in the real

1590.26 --> 1595.6
world it is a globe that just looks flat

1592.6 --> 1598.4699999999998
and it's only when it looks flat that it

1595.6 --> 1600.2199999999998
feels real even though it is a globe so

1598.47 --> 1602.8
the doublethink

1600.22 --> 1606.04
you know even with these crazy new

1602.8 --> 1608.9199999999998
situation situations and these silly

1606.04 --> 1612.19
baller responses to the black swan it's

1608.92 --> 1615.6100000000001
blatantly obvious it's not stopping them

1612.19 --> 1619.47
they're just doubling down they're just

1615.61 --> 1623.61
expanding their doublespeak tactics

1619.47 --> 1626.29
that's it because people do that

1623.61 --> 1628.54
especially in this time and age in this

1626.29 --> 1632.1
time and age they do that now they kind

1628.54 --> 1634.36
of per default have learned self mind

1632.1 --> 1636.82
compartmentalization just to get around

1634.36 --> 1639.9399999999998
because the world's gone completely nuts

1636.82 --> 1643.4199999999998
and certain aspects like really insane

1639.94 --> 1646.96
and if you don't compartmentalize you

1643.42 --> 1649.72
will go insane as well so by that

1646.96 --> 1652.24
standard I think it's just more common

1649.72 --> 1653.8600000000001
for a lot of people to be able to do

1652.24 --> 1657.34
that kind of trickery in their minds and

1653.86 --> 1660.76
just say yeah okay yeah this the 3d

1657.34 --> 1663.49
engine surface has to look perfectly

1660.76 --> 1664.9
flat like in a box with flat surface it

1663.49 --> 1667.36
has to be like that and otherwise it

1664.9 --> 1669.49
won't look real but in their mind that

1667.36 --> 1672.28
still wouldn't necessarily mean that the

1669.49 --> 1674.08
earth is like that and not a globe

1672.28 --> 1675.91
because in their mind they could

1674.08 --> 1679.6599999999999
convince themselves it just has to look

1675.91 --> 1682.3600000000001
flat to look real but it is a globe so

1679.66 --> 1684.0700000000002
you can go that far it will go that far

1682.36 --> 1685.5
you will probably go even further and

1684.07 --> 1688.58
nuttier as

1685.5 --> 1694.07
not ears like the social justice warrior

1688.58 --> 1696.51
fringe craziness desensitization liberal

1694.07 --> 1699.81
insanity how far that is gone

1696.51 --> 1702.86
I think this cognitive dissonance

1699.81 --> 1706.86
process within the globe religion can go

1702.86 --> 1710.1599999999999
just as far if not further in its

1706.86 --> 1717.7199999999998
insanity deepness so that's my

1710.16 --> 1720.8700000000001
prediction no no the earth is not a cube

1717.72 --> 1728.76
it's it's just that in a simulation you

1720.87 --> 1732.1499999999999
use a cube so the earth shape is not a

1728.76 --> 1735.69
cube the earth surface is not a cube

1732.15 --> 1740.67
it's rather the spatial content of a

1735.69 --> 1743.19
realm is well if you want to simulate it

1740.67 --> 1746.88
in a computer it is easily as done in a

1743.19 --> 1752.64
cube or in a some kind of rectangle some

1746.88 --> 1758.97
kind of six-sided space that's the

1752.64 --> 1762.3300000000002
that's the way to do it in a game in a

1758.97 --> 1765.66
3d simulation game so Earth is not a

1762.33 --> 1771.47
cube but earth realm could potentially

1765.66 --> 1771.47
be a cube or a six-sided shape

1776.46 --> 1781.199
[Music]

1807.59 --> 1812.059
Wow a GM I didn't even know that

1809.86 --> 1817.9289999999999
wouldn't surprise me at all you know I

1812.059 --> 1823.85
think that this crazy idea of 5g causing

1817.929 --> 1829.73
Caronia I think it is so crazy it may

1823.85 --> 1834.769
just turn out to be completely true like

1829.73 --> 1840.47
an open grab ler trick that's just so

1834.769 --> 1841.129
extreme so I paid that nobody saw it

1840.47 --> 1843.08
coming

1841.129 --> 1845.869
because everybody was just being

1843.08 --> 1849.74
preoccupied about stupid promises of

1845.869 --> 1852.98
more faster yeah Wireless so you don't

1849.74 --> 1858.35
have to wait anymore for your insanely

1852.98 --> 1861.6490000000001
large file downloads so important people

1858.35 --> 1864.4089999999999
are just like yay yay we're all gonna

1861.649 --> 1867.2299999999998
die because we don't take care of

1864.409 --> 1871.3400000000001
ourselves anymore and we don't think

1867.23 --> 1875.169
about what's gonna happen yay that

1871.34 --> 1878.7099999999998
attitude just freakin cattle stupidity

1875.169 --> 1883.8790000000001
ready to die for their stupidity

1878.71 --> 1886.19
basically so 5g in my opinion has always

1883.879 --> 1888.86
been completely superfluous and useless

1886.19 --> 1890.659
and yeah I wouldn't surprise me one bit

1888.86 --> 1893.029
if it just turns out that they're

1890.659 --> 1895.6390000000001
literally just grabbling around with

1893.029 --> 1900.23
that technology to give people the flu

1895.639 --> 1903.2299999999998
and then use that in their freakin game

1900.23 --> 1906.8600000000001
played their gorona virus close down

1903.23 --> 1909.74
borders game plan their corona chess

1906.86 --> 1915.4699999999998
game you could call that you know it's a

1909.74 --> 1918.039
corona chess game and I wouldn't be

1915.47 --> 1921.3500000000001
surprised one bit if 5g systems were

1918.039 --> 1924.86
absolutely provably utilized to create

1921.35 --> 1927.529
symptoms I wouldn't be surprised one

1924.86 --> 1933.85
little bit not saying it is true but I

1927.529 --> 1933.85
would not be surprised at all just say

1948.86 --> 1961.7099999999998
really unicorn Slayer is that a response

1951.66 --> 1964.7
to what I said you tell me what what's

1961.71 --> 1964.7
our dumb about that

2002.67 --> 2009.39
all right yeah you work to install them

2005.04 --> 2012.87
that's cool I'm not saying that

2009.39 --> 2015.96
installing the devices is gonna cause

2012.87 --> 2019.6699999999998
you to get Corona that's no what I was

2015.96 --> 2022.6200000000001
saying buddy saying that the ones

2019.67 --> 2026.13
installed and activated systems they can

2022.62 --> 2029.6399999999999
then afterward not affecting the

2026.13 --> 2032.8400000000001
installer of the system afterward could

2029.64 --> 2036.5700000000002
potentially be used basically be hacked

2032.84 --> 2040.56
externally with a system to apply for

2036.57 --> 2043.02
that to make that possible bill in right

2040.56 --> 2045.06
it's a secret surfaced tool little grab

2043.02 --> 2052.79
the trick it's supposedly nobody can see

2045.06 --> 2052.79
to do that is that so crazy

2053.899 --> 2063.12
yeah so that's I'm not saying that

2057.71 --> 2066.14
having active 5g systems using them with

2063.12 --> 2073.56
phones I'm not saying that that

2066.14 --> 2075.47
specifically causes flu-like sent what I

2073.56 --> 2079.47
say out of context and I'm just saying

2075.47 --> 2082.4399999999996
the mechanics of these devices when not

2079.47 --> 2084.899
used as they are being said they're

2082.44 --> 2087.63
being used but in other ways hacked

2084.899 --> 2091.47
effectively and altered but use the

2087.63 --> 2095.82
abilities they could do that and they if

2091.47 --> 2098.37
they could they might and maybe they are

2095.82 --> 2100.8300000000004
that's what I'm not saying like oh you

2098.37 --> 2102.7799999999997
have 5g that means you will get the flu

2100.83 --> 2106.22
that's not what I said so don't take my

2102.78 --> 2106.2200000000003
