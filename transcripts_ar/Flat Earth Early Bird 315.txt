73.869 --> 86.86
I'll get back to that because anyway

82.319 --> 90.88
right yeah if I may come across as a

86.86 --> 94.81
little confused explain it anyway the

90.88 --> 97.57
weather is kind of shitty today as you

94.81 --> 99.119
can see from my window and from the

97.57 --> 103.63
clouds out there it's pretty much

99.119 --> 106.78
raining now and yeah I hope it's gonna

103.63 --> 112.84
be better in the weekend at least that

106.78 --> 118.63
would be nice so yeah today I have with

112.84 --> 125.10900000000001
me tea no coffee or anything else cuz I

118.63 --> 129.989
barely slept last night man I've been

125.109 --> 132.91
kind of vividly overwhelmed with

129.989 --> 135.66
nervousness I can only compare it to

132.91 --> 141.18
severe stage fright pretty much been

135.66 --> 145.859
kept up all night and sick and [ __ ] not

141.18 --> 145.859
throwing up or anything but like just

146.94 --> 150.959
just a bit overwhelmed

152.58 --> 168.94
I literally have to catch my breath

164.05 --> 174.58
sometimes it's bizarre anyway there's

168.94 --> 178.09
just a lot of stuff concerning what for

174.58 --> 180.82000000000002
starters this weekend okay I'm gonna go

178.09 --> 187.09
there no matter what its it is gonna be

180.82 --> 189.67
awesome I think but the trip my god like

187.09 --> 196.3
I'm seriously being confronted with

189.67 --> 200.82999999999998
myself here I'm just wondering like how

196.3 --> 204.52
would that be how would I feel so the

200.83 --> 207.0
time like what would happen if I

204.52 --> 212.53
I basically that my mind is going nuts

207.0 --> 214.42
it's just too much activity thinking

212.53 --> 219.85
about too many things and what would

214.42 --> 222.28
happen so now I'm kind of pondering

219.85 --> 226.96
still based upon the assumption that I'm

222.28 --> 229.09
just gonna go that and I need to talk

226.96 --> 232.18
about this with Adam because he probably

229.09 --> 235.84
has the best experience with this is I

232.18 --> 238.9
in some way I would like to keep my

235.84 --> 243.07
flight options flexible if that is

238.9 --> 245.14000000000001
doable because yeah I don't know what

243.07 --> 250.0
will happen like a week is a pretty long

245.14 --> 253.20999999999998
time and like [ __ ] maybe may go wrong

250.0 --> 258.94
with me you know it may happen I may

253.21 --> 261.97
just not get to the right spot with my

258.94 --> 264.49
feeling somehow and just become really

261.97 --> 267.70000000000005
sick or extremely homesick that's

264.49 --> 272.749
something I completely forgot about that

267.7 --> 275.159
I do get homesick like

272.749 --> 278.069
it only happens when they go on

275.159 --> 281.759
prolonged vacations basically like

278.069 --> 284.099
longer than two days and I'm suddenly

281.759 --> 286.949
being reminded about that and just being

284.099 --> 290.43
confronted with all these elements about

286.949 --> 293.639
myself that really prove me to be not a

290.43 --> 298.409
very flexible person when it comes to

293.639 --> 302.999
new situations yeah so I'm wondering oh

298.409 --> 309.419
my god is this is this doable and would

302.999 --> 312.53900000000004
I not be a burden for for Roxanne and

309.419 --> 316.669
Jason you know I don't want to like

312.539 --> 319.43899999999996
overwhelm them and [ __ ] as well because

316.669 --> 322.789
they'll be they would be stuck with me

319.439 --> 326.339
for a prolonged time anyway I'm making

322.789 --> 329.099
hope it's plenty obvious I'm just super

326.339 --> 332.639
overly nervous about this and I'm just

329.099 --> 336.62899999999996
wondering is this a wise thing to do or

332.639 --> 338.669
is it gonna break me you know and the

336.629 --> 341.84900000000005
weirdest thing was is that I got a

338.669 --> 345.15
blessing from my healer about it I

341.849 --> 349.11
really didn't expect it I felt so

345.15 --> 352.10999999999996
nervous up to it like I is gonna be safe

349.11 --> 355.639
with you this is not going to be the

352.11 --> 359.099
ruin of me and when I call them up

355.639 --> 361.919
basically set pretty out right like okay

359.099 --> 363.12
I'm getting messages from my guide that

361.919 --> 365.039
you should just do it

363.12 --> 369.649
it's a coaching opportunity so I was

365.039 --> 369.649
like what what

374.62 --> 387.49
dancing just tourists all right yes done

379.48 --> 392.02000000000004
lucky 3d in it technically that is an

387.49 --> 396.63
option but the consequences of those

392.02 --> 401.53
options may just be too much for me

396.63 --> 406.51
potentially because when it comes down

401.53 --> 409.46999999999997
to this kind of like extreme different

406.51 --> 414.639
circumstances within certain time

409.47 --> 417.72900000000004
I'm almost autistic it's just an

414.639 --> 421.33
unfortunate truth you know like I I fall

417.729 --> 424.93
in that spectrum in some way and things

421.33 --> 429.25
are under control I can do superbly with

424.93 --> 432.72
it but when they are not so much under

429.25 --> 438.01
control and I get very nervous then

432.72 --> 443.40000000000003
unfortunately the those sides also start

438.01 --> 443.4
to show their faces and I'm just afraid

447.12 --> 457.68
about yea Sparrow music look I know that

453.1 --> 462.25
if I do it I would definitely have an I

457.68 --> 469.6
would also enjoy the experience I know

462.25 --> 471.52
it what wow truth-teller that's I don't

469.6 --> 473.35
know if money literally boosts my

471.52 --> 474.9
confidence in this case but it will

473.35 --> 478.12
definitely help in the overall

474.9 --> 481.23999999999995
flexibility because one of the scenarios

478.12 --> 483.91
that I'm also afraid of is that things

481.24 --> 488.919
may just all turn out to become more

483.91 --> 491.25
expensive than anticipated on my side

488.919 --> 491.25
perhaps

491.47 --> 506.01000000000005
oh alright alright alright alright okay

498.84 --> 506.01
okay it's not funny

508.82 --> 515.3
[Music]

512.87 --> 516.44
what's my honest opinion about mark

515.3 --> 522.0989999999999
sergeant ie

516.44 --> 522.099
I don't know

527.22 --> 533.6700000000001
I did look at this point I'll tell you

531.18 --> 536.9399999999999
I'm too preoccupied with my own nerves

533.67 --> 539.5799999999999
right now to even be able to reach out

536.94 --> 542.9100000000001
with my senses to get some kind of

539.58 --> 552.5400000000001
detailed read as I normally do I just I

542.91 --> 554.67
can't I look I'm if I'm right I'm

552.54 --> 560.36
probably gonna meet him face to face for

554.67 --> 564.0899999999999
the first time at the conference

560.36 --> 566.07
starting tomorrow or the day after I

564.09 --> 567.69
don't know if marks are it's like mark

566.07 --> 570.3900000000001
Sargent gonna stay at the camping

567.69 --> 573.0300000000001
grounds as well or is he just gonna pop

570.39 --> 576.84
in on Saturday and I don't know

573.03 --> 576.8399999999999
[Music]

579.19 --> 585.84
Jesus Oh God

582.72 --> 585.84
[Music]

595.12 --> 598.67
right

596.36 --> 605.3290000000001
well my honesty is the only thing that's

598.67 --> 608.42
literally saving me if I wasn't able to

605.329 --> 610.279
be honest about this in a genuine

608.42 --> 613.43
attempt to basically overcome the

610.279 --> 615.829
obstacles as I perceived them then I

613.43 --> 621.05
would just literally walk away and shut

615.829 --> 624.0999999999999
all the doors for a time that's the

621.05 --> 624.0999999999999
alternative option

628.83 --> 631.6700000000001
oh really

634.37 --> 638.72
I've become the laughingstock of the

636.89 --> 643.49
Flat Earth community that is really

638.72 --> 645.37
funny you know I'd like to have some

643.49 --> 648.91
feedback of that [ __ ]

645.37 --> 648.91
like how

657.96 --> 666.32
list of pros and cons I already got that

662.19 --> 666.32
list pretty much in my head

672.68 --> 675.7399999999999
[Music]

683.69 --> 697.07
all right yeah Mazhar Salim in a way

688.46 --> 699.6700000000001
that is kind of weird I look I can't

697.07 --> 704.62
really explain it it could be that the

699.67 --> 706.91
media apparatus has kind of chosen him

704.62 --> 710.15
specifically for a long term term

706.91 --> 716.42
targets because of his overall attitude

710.15 --> 719.15
on camera they can it could be a thing

716.42 --> 721.31
like okay he is reliable and they can

719.15 --> 723.8
work with that so they'll just forward

721.31 --> 725.4499999999999
mark sergeant maybe that is the reason I

723.8 --> 728.41
don't know exactly what's going on

725.45 --> 728.4100000000001
concerning all that

743.709 --> 746.709
Wow

755.08 --> 757.7700000000001
man

762.33 --> 764.9300000000001
yeah

766.149 --> 777.779
I don't know who the even is I don't get

769.809 --> 777.779
what people say things like that anyway

781.94 --> 789.96
it's the top flattered look I'm just a

787.53 --> 793.92
freakin guy and I've been tenacious with

789.96 --> 797.58
my show in my activity at the same time

793.92 --> 802.0799999999999
I fall I know that I am also seen as a

797.58 --> 804.72
guy that is not super flexible and I've

802.08 --> 806.9100000000001
been extremely unusually forward about

804.72 --> 809.1600000000001
that and that is probably one of the

806.91 --> 811.35
most remarkable elements about me is

809.16 --> 814.3199999999999
that I'm so extremely forward and

811.35 --> 818.97
detailed honest about myself and even my

814.32 --> 823.25
inner workings that that is is probably

818.97 --> 826.32
seen as bizarre by a lot of people or

823.25 --> 828.27
they just don't believe that that is

826.32 --> 832.5600000000001
possible so they just think this is some

828.27 --> 834.75
kind of weird Act even though I could I

832.56 --> 839.64
can't imagine how to act something like

834.75 --> 846.99
that because you know reality is way too

839.64 --> 849.03
complicated and an elaborate to just

846.99 --> 857.7
start to make up [ __ ] in between all

849.03 --> 861.27
that you know right but I am also like

857.7 --> 865.2
not just brutally honest I'm also

861.27 --> 870.06
proudly honest about my weaknesses for

865.2 --> 872.1600000000001
example like I realized that for so many

870.06 --> 875.67
people in the world it's literally

872.16 --> 878.78
common not be able to be able to show

875.67 --> 881.43
their weaknesses socially that they

878.78 --> 883.56
don't allow it and those people would

881.43 --> 886.9799999999999
also never go to a psychologist or

883.56 --> 891.06
whatever and I used to have I used to be

886.98 --> 893.3100000000001
like that and I'm just like I actively

891.06 --> 895.6199999999999
had to work on that because it was gonna

893.31 --> 898.8
ruin everything for me on the long run

895.62 --> 901.2
gonna block me everywhere so I just

898.8 --> 903.9
chose to become kind of like my own

901.2 --> 906.84
therapist starting out as not just

903.9 --> 909.3199999999999
trying to explain myself to to other

906.84 --> 909.32
people

909.62 --> 916.91
started doing that 20 years ago and got

913.17 --> 916.91
quite proficient at it

917.209 --> 923.579
and it is very unusual to then start

920.699 --> 929.639
doing that on camera in public but for

923.579 --> 930.829
me it is kind of hard not to I don't

929.639 --> 934.29
know I

930.829 --> 940.069
it is super annoying I talk way too much

934.29 --> 940.069
about myself I really do I know I know

942.589 --> 961.5
just [ __ ] nervous yeah hello Randy

955.35 --> 963.0600000000001
flutters good to see you now I didn't

961.5 --> 966.41
even go through the list I completely

963.06 --> 966.41
forgot sorry

977.529 --> 984.23
yeah let's try to do that and see okay a

1058.12 --> 1060.54
see you all

1067.58 --> 1075.4189999999999
so basically at this point

1071.46 --> 1078.72
oh it's skipped you did ice more color

1075.419 --> 1082.0200000000002
sorry right at this point it's just that

1078.72 --> 1085.74
I don't know if I can temper my own

1082.02 --> 1089.429
nerves and so I don't know if I will be

1085.74 --> 1091.919
able to basically yet get this demon

1089.429 --> 1094.5300000000002
under control in order to get myself to

1091.919 --> 1096.8400000000001
actually engage in this despite all all

1094.53 --> 1100.799
the support and basically everyone

1096.84 --> 1104.09
wanting me to do this so and if that

1100.799 --> 1108.4189999999999
were to be the case then I promise that

1104.09 --> 1112.3799999999999
like I'll either make sure to return all

1108.419 --> 1115.8300000000002
the of these the PayPal donations I get

1112.38 --> 1120.23
or kind of like reinvested in for

1115.83 --> 1120.23
example a stat if for the camera

1122.48 --> 1127.3700000000001
what are you serious Randy

1132.56 --> 1135.79
are you serious

1160.05 --> 1181.77
right terrible timing dude anyway I'm

1175.31 --> 1184.61
just saying like I can't yeah and to be

1181.77 --> 1187.98
fair I'm probably the one that's being

1184.61 --> 1189.57
the most harsh to me about all this if I

1187.98 --> 1191.25
wouldn't do it I would be super sit

1189.57 --> 1193.9199999999998
disappointed in me I just don't know if

1191.25 --> 1196.17
I can get myself to do it or that I'm

1193.92 --> 1198.69
just literally gonna be spending hours

1196.17 --> 1205.88
on the toilet that kind of [ __ ] you know

1198.69 --> 1208.95
that's not good for anything but I will

1205.88 --> 1211.47
absolutely for starters go to the

1208.95 --> 1216.56
conference and see what will happen to

1211.47 --> 1216.56
this to the energy that I'm dealing with

1223.6 --> 1227.61
the Dark Star that's the thing

1230.37 --> 1235.1399999999999
about the changes right I totally agree

1233.1 --> 1236.52
with you yeah that's you're never gonna

1235.14 --> 1238.0800000000002
get anywhere if you're not gonna try

1236.52 --> 1243.2
anything new but there's this thing

1238.08 --> 1246.75
about me and that is I'm a slow grower I

1243.2 --> 1249.8400000000001
need a lot of mental preparation for

1246.75 --> 1254.4
[ __ ] and this was literally just sprung

1249.84 --> 1257.789
on me what is it a day ago or is it dude

1254.4 --> 1260.52
I don't even remember it's way too short

1257.789 --> 1263.1589999999999
notice for me actually like I needs

1260.52 --> 1265.59
munceford like I needed a lot of mental

1263.159 --> 1268.0490000000002
preparation even for the conference it

1265.59 --> 1270.6899999999998
sounds weird but that's how I do it

1268.049 --> 1274.1399999999999
that's how I work the best that's how I

1270.69 --> 1276.51
get through it and actually perform if

1274.14 --> 1281.73
things are sprung on me just very subtly

1276.51 --> 1283.83
I get chaotic I lose it it's a weakness

1281.73 --> 1286.95
of mine there's just nothing I can do

1283.83 --> 1291.6789999999999
about it I can't get that away I've

1286.95 --> 1294.779
tried by just doing the random [ __ ]

1291.679 --> 1297.179
constantly I just go nuts if that

1294.779 --> 1301.07
happens unfortunately I hate that aspect

1297.179 --> 1303.659
about myself but it's just no other way

1301.07 --> 1309.32
so if they have to be able to temper it

1303.659 --> 1309.3200000000002
or I'll just wreck myself

1310.9 --> 1316.41
no Randy that's not how it works at all

1317.22 --> 1323.55
you can't coerce me in this kind of

1319.96 --> 1323.55
scenario it's just not healthy

1337.61 --> 1344.799
I know

1339.82 --> 1349.4399999999998
and I wanna try at least so that's why

1344.799 --> 1355.389
I'm still in the works of flex flex in

1349.44 --> 1359.789
how to approach this like am I gonna go

1355.389 --> 1365.879
a few days with them say up to Berlin

1359.789 --> 1367.96
that it's much shorter period it's like

1365.879 --> 1371.019
less to be nervous about

1367.96 --> 1373.779
but you're doable and then probably I

1371.019 --> 1377.289
even predict that in that situation if I

1373.779 --> 1382.33
do that at the end I feel like I could

1377.289 --> 1384.759
go more but that would probably I don't

1382.33 --> 1386.9789999999998
know I it's just I don't know if I can

1384.759 --> 1392.71
pull through that long that's really it

1386.979 --> 1395.1290000000001
mostly it's a long way long time to be

1392.71 --> 1395.1290000000001
on the road

1395.97 --> 1404.999
don't smoke cannabis well I definitely

1398.349 --> 1404.999
want I won't be allowed to so

1410.02 --> 1416.41
my initial response my initial response

1413.08 --> 1419.29
was being nervous as [ __ ] my initial

1416.41 --> 1425.2900000000002
response was actually anxiety Sparrow

1419.29 --> 1429.1789999999999
music really but not deep because at the

1425.29 --> 1429.1789999999999
same time yet it is also exciting

1436.79 --> 1445.08
look yeah Thank You Hana koala Kurtz I

1441.29 --> 1448.49
appreciate that I yeah I do kind of

1445.08 --> 1452.04
think that I am I I doubt I'm not as

1448.49 --> 1453.69
staged frightful as I used to be I used

1452.04 --> 1456.21
to have series they tried having people

1453.69 --> 1459.72
look at it was pretty bad that's not

1456.21 --> 1463.3500000000001
really the issue here though not really

1459.72 --> 1465.03
I have a little for being visible to the

1463.35 --> 1468.6599999999999
conference as it were but that's a

1465.03 --> 1472.1399999999999
little the anxiety that really comes

1468.66 --> 1476.91
from this is doing unexpected things

1472.14 --> 1481.98
without having time to properly plan it

1476.91 --> 1484.17
to my own to temper my nerves that's the

1481.98 --> 1497.28
issue that is really the issue not stage

1484.17 --> 1499.8300000000002
fright it makes me it the sensation is

1497.28 --> 1503.01
kind of compared to being afraid for

1499.83 --> 1504.84
your life really although probably not

1503.01 --> 1509.37
as vivid as that but it's very

1504.84 --> 1515.25
comparable to it it's like just afraid

1509.37 --> 1519.33
out because I'm not in the zone level

1515.25 --> 1522.69
prepared that I'll suddenly be

1519.33 --> 1525.09
confronted with some heavy demon or

1522.69 --> 1528.92
whatever and it'll be the enemy that's

1525.09 --> 1528.9199999999998
literally what that feels like

1537.51 --> 1542.11
it

1539.27 --> 1542.11
all right

1542.28 --> 1547.98
yeah I totally yeah I'm getting a Dutch

1546.36 --> 1549.6899999999998
response here with somebody that's

1547.98 --> 1554.31
literally just calling me mentally

1549.69 --> 1557.79
handicapped and I get it you know if I'd

1554.31 --> 1560.22
hurt somebody on YouTube talking about

1557.79 --> 1562.17
this [ __ ] I probably have that kind of

1560.22 --> 1563.52
smarmy response to that as well I

1562.17 --> 1568.16
totally get it

1563.52 --> 1574.19
you know the difference is though that

1568.16 --> 1574.19
I'm putting all of this out there with

1575.03 --> 1582.74
kind of with a consequence and that is

1579.99 --> 1586.83
mainly that I'm throwing it out there

1582.74 --> 1589.41
not because I'm saying oh that's how

1586.83 --> 1593.85
it's gonna be forever no it is because I

1589.41 --> 1596.91
am trying to work on it that's why I

1593.85 --> 1602.82
throw it out there if I thought it was

1596.91 --> 1605.88
something that I would never be able to

1602.82 --> 1608.49
face up in a public setting I'd probably

1605.88 --> 1611.2800000000002
never throw it out there and sometimes I

1608.49 --> 1619.08
wonder though if I if I don't go a

1611.28 --> 1622.529
little too far with this but yep

1619.08 --> 1625.379
right well look psychological diagnosis

1622.529 --> 1629.21
all these yeah I am not the average

1625.379 --> 1633.7099999999998
person I think that's blatantly obvious

1629.21 --> 1639.749
but I don't have any psychological

1633.71 --> 1642.57
designation officially because I want to

1639.749 --> 1647.279
believe that I can somehow on the long

1642.57 --> 1652.049
run overcome it because it really hurts

1647.279 --> 1657.749
my sense of honor if that makes any

1652.049 --> 1659.97
sense and also I don't want to be caught

1657.749 --> 1664.23
up in a system where I just get a few

1659.97 --> 1666.33
more bucks and then get all these people

1664.23 --> 1669.45
that are constantly checking up on you

1666.33 --> 1671.039
if like treating you like a [ __ ] or

1669.45 --> 1675.059
whatever because that happens I know

1671.039 --> 1677.429
other people that have done all that to

1675.059 --> 1680.1
get the extra cash and all that and they

1677.429 --> 1683.519
do get bothered by these people and I

1680.1 --> 1686.2489999999998
just every time I hear about it it's

1683.519 --> 1689.239
just like okay if you're willing to go

1686.249 --> 1693.749
through that I it's so humiliating

1689.239 --> 1695.999
no that is what I find humiliating when

1693.749 --> 1698.34
you're basically forced to indulge

1695.999 --> 1701.789
people treating you like retards or

1698.34 --> 1706.649
you'll risk something financial that is

1701.789 --> 1710.539
humiliation to me that is a ticket in a

1706.649 --> 1713.7299999999998
way a terrible one I'd rather just

1710.539 --> 1716.94
humiliate myself voluntarily we'll be

1713.73 --> 1722.6390000000001
with throwing out in in public my own

1716.94 --> 1727.409
weaknesses as a as an attempt basically

1722.639 --> 1730.6689999999999
to the kind of force growth myself out

1727.409 --> 1730.669
of there okay

1737.47 --> 1744.59
because I do believe in myself and I

1741.11 --> 1747.289
know the qualities that I do have you

1744.59 --> 1749.4189999999999
know the weaknesses that I do have and I

1747.289 --> 1753.59
have the intelligence to somehow manage

1749.419 --> 1759.8600000000001
it my greatest weakness is trying to do

1753.59 --> 1762.4089999999999
things impromptu like direction changes

1759.86 --> 1764.75
impromptu that's the worst I can

1762.409 --> 1767.63
improvise oh yeah but when it comes to

1764.75 --> 1770.99
like path direction of what I am doing

1767.63 --> 1774.65
and with my entirety being doing that

1770.99 --> 1778.539
impromptu that is something that I've

1774.65 --> 1778.539
great difficulty with always had

1787.17 --> 1793.77
right Nicholas Roberts thank you that is

1792.9 --> 1799.5
how I see it

1793.77 --> 1803.43
they are my struggles and I don't know

1799.5 --> 1808.26
as a secondary thing to what I'm doing

1803.43 --> 1810.96
look I realize there are just a lot lots

1808.26 --> 1814.07
of people out there that never show

1810.96 --> 1814.07
their faces that also

1815.88 --> 1826.919
get drills in the wall lolz anyway that

1823.89 --> 1830.25
that deal with these kinds of things as

1826.919 --> 1835.5
well and that barely even know how to

1830.25 --> 1839.64
just talk about it and so it added I'm

1835.5 --> 1842.549
also trying to hand out like hey this is

1839.64 --> 1847.8600000000001
a way you can also deal with this kind

1842.549 --> 1852.179
of issue and still still even have some

1847.86 --> 1856.5
kind of public face without just being

1852.179 --> 1858.299
like oh I am the the [ __ ] or whatever

1856.5 --> 1860.429
that needs attention to without

1858.299 --> 1863.25
surrendering to that kind of image in

1860.429 --> 1866.22
the face of society because there's

1863.25 --> 1867.09
people that do that as well it's just so

1866.22 --> 1869.94
humiliating

1867.09 --> 1873.809
I try to be a serious person with the

1869.94 --> 1875.909
weakness and I'm trying to show a person

1873.809 --> 1877.86
that can be taken seriously with this

1875.909 --> 1882.929
weakness and I'm trying to show others

1877.86 --> 1885.299
how they could potentially get there in

1882.929 --> 1895.5900000000001
some way as well by showing it to them

1885.299 --> 1901.32
so because I know they're out there can

1895.59 --> 1904.86
they dwell with just days they dwell as

1901.32 --> 1907.35
well as I have had as I've I have in the

1904.86 --> 1911.1
past they dwell around seeking for new

1907.35 --> 1913.3799999999999
things to unleash their mind on as at

1911.1 --> 1915.6
the same time they're trying to hi

1913.38 --> 1917.5100000000002
conceal from themselves all the things

1915.6 --> 1920.9699999999998
that I don't know how to deal with and

1917.51 --> 1925.14
hopefully by showing some of that

1920.97 --> 1927.03
they'll have some kind of angle to how

1925.14 --> 1932.99
to actually approach those things that

1927.03 --> 1932.99
they hide from themselves because yeah

1933.08 --> 1944.49
anyway my motivation really is a good

1936.48 --> 1947.66
one for the world and I'm still freaking

1944.49 --> 1947.66
nervous is is terrible

1969.69 --> 1976.41
huh a GM that's that's a lariat are you

1974.4 --> 1982.19
gonna be at the are you at the

1976.41 --> 1982.19
conference I do probably not right

1987.48 --> 1992.809
all right Thank You Lori I appreciate

1990.75 --> 1992.809
that

1997.89 --> 2000.969
[Music]

2003.85 --> 2010.76
all right look I probably am gonna go I

2008.21 --> 2015.23
don't know even how far that I'll go

2010.76 --> 2017.12
I just kind of need for this issue that

2015.23 --> 2019.19
I have I need to reserve the right to

2017.12 --> 2025.9899999999998
chicken out basically that's what it

2019.19 --> 2025.99
comes down to it's just these nerves man

2026.409 --> 2032.3890000000001
it's just that I'd beat the option

2029.059 --> 2036.47
available like I that's all this I

2032.389 --> 2040.399
probably will go not just nerves

2036.47 --> 2042.3500000000001
I hate it like I don't even like sitting

2040.399 --> 2045.5189999999998
still when I'm like this I just want to

2042.35 --> 2045.519
walk around in circles

2055.23 --> 2060.48
yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna breathe that's

2058.0 --> 2060.48
fine

2070.669 --> 2073.99
anyway I'm gonna

2074.53 --> 2083.3
somewhere this evening probably I'm

2077.119 --> 2085.8790000000004
gonna Skype call African it right right

2083.3 --> 2091.159
right most forgotten I also need to get

2085.879 --> 2093.74
my collect my pants which the knee are

2091.159 --> 2098.03
is fixed so at least have a proper pair

2093.74 --> 2102.5
of pants yeah without a hole in it time

2098.03 --> 2106.849
to do this Oh God but anyway I'm gonna

2102.5 --> 2109.849
convey without a Meakin later I think in

2106.849 --> 2113.349
the evening just about the flight

2109.849 --> 2116.9
situation how I can manage that

2113.349 --> 2118.88
get it all worked out so I know like

2116.9 --> 2121.819
okay I have to ordered the ticket

2118.88 --> 2126.5
there's no other way or I could actually

2121.819 --> 2128.42
keep it flexible that would be great no

2126.5 --> 2132.26
spare room music I'm not nervous about

2128.42 --> 2134.839
the conference actually no no you know

2132.26 --> 2137.7200000000003
why because I had half a year to prepare

2134.839 --> 2141.71
for it mentally I have been nervous for

2137.72 --> 2145.609
it like in the last week a little very

2141.71 --> 2149.329
doable this thing however like that was

2145.609 --> 2153.23
sprung on me a day ago totally killing

2149.329 --> 2158.349
me totally killing me I literally have

2153.23 --> 2163.43
well sorry like diarrhea and [ __ ] and

2158.349 --> 2166.94
constant nerve convulsion it's a

2163.43 --> 2169.569
decadent it just freaking stressed out

2166.94 --> 2169.569
from there's

2172.189 --> 2181.109
are you speaking at afternoon oh I am

2175.14 --> 2183.8089999999997
speaking at after at going on to the

2181.109 --> 2187.049
globe light tour that I've been invited

2183.809 --> 2189.8390000000004
and that I like everybody's pushing me

2187.049 --> 2192.9
to do this so like and I kind of want to

2189.839 --> 2195.299
do it but I'm just just sprang on me

2192.9 --> 2213.929
I didn't nobody asked me like a month

2195.299 --> 2218.67
ago will I be on stage at the conference

2213.929 --> 2220.65
I don't know probably not I I predict

2218.67 --> 2225.559
I'm probably still gonna be nervous

2220.65 --> 2225.559
about that going on the trip it's weird

2243.75 --> 2246.26
what

2251.14 --> 2257.42
then we do it do we do it yes so helping

2254.6 --> 2260.33
so much everybody me oh this is so great

2257.42 --> 2271.67
you get it do it right now or it do it

2260.33 --> 2275.2
that really helps no no it doesn't yeah

2271.67 --> 2275.2000000000003
thank [ __ ] yeah

2288.81 --> 2298.2999999999997
look what I'm gonna try to do is to work

2293.17 --> 2301.03
out and as flexible set up for it all so

2298.3 --> 2306.01
that I could basically cancel without

2301.03 --> 2308.02
grave cutting in my own finances that I

2306.01 --> 2310.3900000000003
could have a short trip that I could

2308.02 --> 2315.13
have the full trip all that they could

2310.39 --> 2318.97
all be optional without any grave losses

2315.13 --> 2325.38
that is my most ideal setup to prepare

2318.97 --> 2325.3799999999997
for and then yeah just see where it goes

2326.37 --> 2329.5
[Music]

2331.63 --> 2338.65
it's mark sergeant providing us with

2335.38 --> 2343.059
scripts that's hilarious dude that is

2338.65 --> 2345.4
freakin amazing although look he might

2343.059 --> 2349.2690000000002
have like certain suggestions or an

2345.4 --> 2352.359
outlook you know maybe he's got a tab

2349.269 --> 2353.2889999999998
somewhere in mediaand as it has a guy in

2352.359 --> 2356.319
mediaand

2353.289 --> 2357.6400000000003
that he's kind of friends with that

2356.319 --> 2360.369
heads up

2357.64 --> 2362.68
him about certain things that are gonna

2360.369 --> 2368.8900000000003
happen in medial and I don't know maybe

2362.68 --> 2373.5389999999998
that is what this is about but he is not

2368.89 --> 2375.519
like like when did he ever even attempt

2373.539 --> 2380.349
any kind of gatekeeping you know it just

2375.519 --> 2385.109
doesn't make any sense so I don't I

2380.349 --> 2390.579
don't get this this paranoia concerning

2385.109 --> 2392.589
marks Arjun I mean yeah you got to keep

2390.579 --> 2396.88
an eye open of course there are some

2392.589 --> 2398.859
like weird little thingies but there's

2396.88 --> 2401.88
just no direct sign that there's

2398.859 --> 2401.88
something really wrong

2409.97 --> 2415.0099999999998
right peanuts clerk thank you for that

2412.16 --> 2417.29
but I did get a lot of time to work on

2415.01 --> 2424.67
that though and it was very much in a

2417.29 --> 2434.18
comfortable place mainly here in a

2424.67 --> 2440.109
stable situation [ __ ] I wish I feels

2434.18 --> 2440.109
like such an ass just being this nervous

2446.26 --> 2451.9700000000003
yeah yeah the seed the thing I was

2449.39 --> 2453.71
actually mentally preparing myself for

2451.97 --> 2457.1299999999997
in the last month mostly

2453.71 --> 2461.06
is getting to work

2457.13 --> 2462.77
that's what's now like actually sitting

2461.06 --> 2467.7999999999997
in my mind of like that's what I'm

2462.77 --> 2467.8
supposed to be doing next week see how

2472.21 --> 2478.88
and the odd thing about the whole thing

2476.51 --> 2483.88
is that yeah my healer gave me his

2478.88 --> 2493.46
blessing so directly so it just it is so

2483.88 --> 2495.62
conflicting so confusing so relative or

2493.46 --> 2498.26
win equilibrium I like that thank you

2495.62 --> 2500.69
very much yeah that's it that's

2498.26 --> 2502.4900000000002
definitely where I need to be or where I

2500.69 --> 2505.37
want to be although I'm probably not

2502.49 --> 2512.0899999999997
going to for a while I'm still

2505.37 --> 2514.46
accelerating it so it seems that doesn't

2512.09 --> 2516.59
seem to be a lot of air friction though

2514.46 --> 2519.76
as I seem to be reaching a maximum

2516.59 --> 2519.76
velocity very quickly

2527.56 --> 2530.56
anyway

2536.69 --> 2541.9500000000003
yeah this is just gonna be the early

2539.94 --> 2549.619
bird show talking about me being nervous

2541.95 --> 2549.6189999999997
isn't it that's just it

2557.66 --> 2566.7599999999998
yeah I got a lot of ballers on my back

2560.73 --> 2569.04
I know Braveheart got to them this is

2566.76 --> 2571.4
very amusing because yeah the ballers

2569.04 --> 2573.89
are literally like machines

2571.4 --> 2577.71
subconsciously often scouring for

2573.89 --> 2580.83
weaknesses to find among flat earthers

2577.71 --> 2583.2
in order to be able to assimilate that

2580.83 --> 2585.93
and make that part of the thing that is

2583.2 --> 2590.79
done in order to whatever humiliate them

2585.93 --> 2593.6099999999997
or try to force in some kind of point

2590.79 --> 2596.19
and so yeah I have a lot of weird [ __ ]

2593.61 --> 2599.13
that I throw out there that ballers will

2596.19 --> 2600.78
love to love to kind of like oh wow we

2599.13 --> 2602.85
could definitely do something with that

2600.78 --> 2608.0400000000004
let's make some new videos about that

2602.85 --> 2610.92
[ __ ] and you know that but I don't

2608.04 --> 2613.59
really care because if I did then I

2610.92 --> 2617.33
would probably just would not be sitting

2613.59 --> 2617.33
here sharing this with all of you

2656.02 --> 2659.79
yeah grandma Gemma

2676.98 --> 2685.029
Thank You peanuts Clark it's a good

2679.21 --> 2687.039
question I I kind of do one of you feel

2685.029 --> 2690.43
want to be left alone about it in the

2687.039 --> 2692.71
sense that look I really do recognize

2690.43 --> 2694.0789999999997
and appreciate all of your support and

2692.71 --> 2698.349
your enthusiasm

2694.079 --> 2700.779
it's just that it's not a lack of

2698.349 --> 2704.799
enthusiasm that is kind of being the

2700.779 --> 2709.14
obstacle to me here it's it's just the

2704.799 --> 2709.14
the nerves

2711.57 --> 2715.8500000000004
all right truth is truth sorry for that

2724.68 --> 2729.48
staying and background until you are

2727.08 --> 2731.87
comfortable then make your own stress

2729.48 --> 2731.87
and ride

2739.229 --> 2742.229
yeah

2744.59 --> 2752.88
no but look

2748.65 --> 2759.17
how do I try to explain it it's not a

2752.88 --> 2759.17
mental issue really it is physiological

2760.4 --> 2765.42
you know I have my mind pretty much

2763.02 --> 2767.58
under control I know what it does in

2765.42 --> 2770.85
response to feelings and all that I can

2767.58 --> 2772.77
prevent myself from dwelling into dark

2770.85 --> 2777.24
corners that I shouldn't go with my mind

2772.77 --> 2782.52
it's literally literally an organ right

2777.24 --> 2787.4399999999996
here that is just doing that okay it's

2782.52 --> 2793.34
purely physiological it's not it's not

2787.44 --> 2796.32
my mind that needs more grip it's

2793.34 --> 2798.65
feelings and I just have to deal with

2796.32 --> 2798.65
that

2816.39 --> 2826.92
well that's the thing mother Salim

2820.43 --> 2831.779
psychological is a very look call it

2826.92 --> 2834.869
psychological call it not you it

2831.779 --> 2838.829
definitely has to do with knowing and

2834.869 --> 2840.48
adapt and at that psychological would be

2838.829 --> 2842.1600000000003
a good designation but there are just

2840.48 --> 2844.529
different types of psychological

2842.16 --> 2847.319
problems you know we can have confusion

2844.529 --> 2849.539
or you can't focus on something for

2847.319 --> 2851.609
example or you obsess over those are

2849.539 --> 2856.0190000000002
typical psychological problems but this

2851.609 --> 2859.14
is just literally me experiencing

2856.019 --> 2862.859
constant nerves and nausea physically

2859.14 --> 2867.18
feels physiological like my body is

2862.859 --> 2869.91
doing that not it's not me actively in

2867.18 --> 2872.94
my mind doing these things it's just

2869.91 --> 2876.39
something I'm being subjected by my body

2872.94 --> 2881.15
it's very unpleasant so it's just

2876.39 --> 2881.15
different it's my body doing this [ __ ]

2881.779 --> 2888.619
it's almost like my body's is actually

2884.73 --> 2894.93
holding my my mind hostage like hey

2888.619 --> 2899.2200000000003
don't risk this [ __ ] for us for the body

2894.93 --> 2901.8489999999997
part the it's kind of what it what it

2899.22 --> 2901.8489999999997
seems like

2905.52 --> 2912.55
but I also know it is a typical organic

2908.98 --> 2915.369
process so that upon first trigger it's

2912.55 --> 2920.5
the most heavy and that does die down

2915.369 --> 2923.71
over time unless like more angst seeps

2920.5 --> 2928.41
in because of more uncertainty is piling

2923.71 --> 2931.18
on that kind of thing but yeah you know

2928.41 --> 2933.3399999999997
today I'm gonna be nervous as [ __ ]

2931.18 --> 2935.14
pretty much all day long I'm absolutely

2933.34 --> 2937.75
certain about it's not gonna stop

2935.14 --> 2943.27
tomorrow however I might feel a lot

2937.75 --> 2945.55
better I might feel that this is still

2943.27 --> 2950.2599999999998
there it's just not on a level that

2945.55 --> 2952.4700000000003
literally screws my physiology up as

2950.26 --> 2952.4700000000003
much

2955.03 --> 2958.2690000000002
[Music]

2967.18 --> 2977.2599999999998
actually thinking about it I won't be

2972.29 --> 2977.2599999999998
stop being such a dick please my chat

2980.86 --> 2987.28
even thinking about it that it may

2983.6 --> 2991.9
actually be better tomorrow is actually

2987.28 --> 2991.9
helping it's funny

3005.31 --> 3008.48
right Cleary

3010.98 --> 3015.96
what you could call it light or darkness

3013.79 --> 3021.98
for me that means something different

3015.96 --> 3024.3
for me it means motion versus stillness

3021.98 --> 3028.28
because you don't get anywhere when

3024.3 --> 3032.369
you're still as it were but it is for me

3028.28 --> 3038.78
kind of I get some kind of weird

3032.369 --> 3038.78
advantage out of that but yeah I don't

3039.53 --> 3044.19
yeah this is in the societal sense I

3042.66 --> 3047.99
don't really get anywhere from that

3044.19 --> 3051.66
position so you were totally right that

3047.99 --> 3055.2799999999997
in that sense metaphorically it is the

3051.66 --> 3060.8999999999996
me going into motion that frightens me

3055.28 --> 3065.119
as providing the ask while sitting still

3060.9 --> 3068.39
is just second nature to me

3065.119 --> 3068.3900000000003
in a way

3081.26 --> 3083.92
right

3084.04 --> 3090.23
yeah Darkstar the thing is also and in

3088.19 --> 3092.54
in a way I don't know

3090.23 --> 3095.0
no afterward I almost feel been guilty

3092.54 --> 3099.68
towards my public I just need to

3095.0 --> 3102.29
freaking talk about it a lot for me that

3099.68 --> 3104.69
really works well against nerves so

3102.29 --> 3108.31
funny thing is now I've been talking

3104.69 --> 3112.82
about it for in like 50 minutes now

3108.31 --> 3115.0299999999997
fifty-fifty and I already feel less

3112.82 --> 3118.2200000000003
nervous than when the show started

3115.03 --> 3120.5
despite at the start of the show that

3118.22 --> 3123.52
level of nerves that was pretty much

3120.5 --> 3125.36
what I have had all night long

3123.52 --> 3127.7599999999998
literally it was there I've had a

3125.36 --> 3131.84
terrible night this night just barely

3127.76 --> 3134.03
slept constant nerve pulses just

3131.84 --> 3135.83
screwing with my senses all the time

3134.03 --> 3140.8100000000004
it's terrible it was a terrible night

3135.83 --> 3144.08
this night for me and I certainly damn

3140.81 --> 3151.7
well hope that that this night is going

3144.08 --> 3154.85
to be better it better be ah the world

3151.7 --> 3157.6099999999997
won't stop turning now I never started

3154.85 --> 3163.94
turning Sparrow music it's always been

3157.61 --> 3167.63
stationary but the Sun will definitely

3163.94 --> 3169.76
still go up and go down and the globe of

3167.63 --> 3173.8900000000003
the heavens and all the stars will keep

3169.76 --> 3173.8900000000003
on turning nevertheless that is true

3184.98 --> 3193.809
this is bizarre I literally have a

3188.289 --> 3196.4700000000003
muscle ache probably from the nerves

3193.809 --> 3196.4700000000003
it's weird

3247.22 --> 3257.24
all right Alexander Lightwood that's a

3250.25 --> 3262.4
good thing whoa what I usually tend to

3257.24 --> 3265.3689999999997
do as a first thing and it works it's

3262.4 --> 3269.21
like try to get myself as far as to

3265.369 --> 3272.6600000000003
apply the placebo effect when the pulses

3269.21 --> 3274.76
of nerves have stopped and then I can

3272.66 --> 3279.859
actually just take away a layer of these

3274.76 --> 3282.8590000000004
nerves and that just happened like five

3279.859 --> 3284.63
minutes ago it I don't know I I mean I

3282.859 --> 3286.97
was kind of shaking all the way I'm not

3284.63 --> 3290.119
shaking anymore now it's weird but it

3286.97 --> 3294.68
only works when the nerve pulses have

3290.119 --> 3296.1800000000003
stopped pulsing because yeah you can

3294.68 --> 3298.31
placebo that out of the way then you

3296.18 --> 3300.14
think I'm calm and then it's being right

3298.31 --> 3303.349
back again so that doesn't work

3300.14 --> 3306.319
but once the pulses have stopped I will

3303.349 --> 3308.78
keep on in like the shakey mode but then

3306.319 --> 3312.0099999999998
I can just placebo it away as long as

3308.78 --> 3315.38
the pauses stop and I guess they stopped

3312.01 --> 3321.369
my nerve fit from this night probably

3315.38 --> 3326.319
has ended now feel a lot better

3321.369 --> 3332.569
so yeah weird issues of a weird guy and

3326.319 --> 3337.0299999999997
his Daily Show also talks about flat

3332.569 --> 3337.0299999999997
earth sometimes and the globe lie

3352.53 --> 3363.6600000000003
don't three wheels what the hell doc my

3355.47 --> 3366.3799999999997
god now Rambo Jambo the thing is the

3363.66 --> 3368.91
overthinking is already happening but

3366.38 --> 3371.01
it's a good advice actually which is

3368.91 --> 3374.3999999999996
what you're saying going out for a walk

3371.01 --> 3375.96
yes there's actually good chance that

3374.4 --> 3379.23
I'll be doing that pretty much right

3375.96 --> 3383.28
after the show you know I have not

3379.23 --> 3385.47
packed because I will still need the

3383.28 --> 3390.9300000000003
things that I'm gonna be packing for

3385.47 --> 3392.8799999999997
this night and it's not gonna take that

3390.93 --> 3397.109
long you know I've got the whole day

3392.88 --> 3399.859
Friday or well the whole first half of

3397.109 --> 3407.7599999999998
the day to basically pack and all that

3399.859 --> 3412.44
yeah yeah that's something I don't do hm

3407.76 --> 3415.05
that stuff is yeah I don't do

3412.44 --> 3423.3
pharmaceuticals I just have to deal with

3415.05 --> 3426.3900000000003
this I yeah that's just how I work it's

3423.3 --> 3430.6800000000003
only in absolute acute situations where

3426.39 --> 3431.9
things are like really terrible like

3430.68 --> 3437.91
something terrible has happened

3431.9 --> 3440.599
something then you know I might like one

3437.91 --> 3444.8689999999997
time take something like that it's just

3440.599 --> 3445.29
yeah for a cute survival purposes that's

3444.869 --> 3450.1400000000003
it

3445.29 --> 3450.14
I'd never even buy that stuff ever

3462.27 --> 3466.02
brain fart you're hilarious

3466.74 --> 3488.1099999999997
have I been this nervous before to this

3475.81 --> 3492.22
level probably well it's probably yeah

3488.11 --> 3498.3700000000003
probably worse than this I've had like

3492.22 --> 3502.27
during my exams or not exactly during my

3498.37 --> 3510.25
exams rather like the week that preceded

3502.27 --> 3513.0099999999998
it had a terrible terrible time and how

3510.25 --> 3516.82
did that turn out well mixed because

3513.01 --> 3525.4300000000003
when I actually got to my exams part I

3516.82 --> 3529.54
was really in the zone but yeah I had

3525.43 --> 3533.41
literally half a lifetime to prepare for

3529.54 --> 3537.1
that like I knew it was gonna come still

3533.41 --> 3539.74
got super nervous though but that was

3537.1 --> 3543.13
more like a prestige fright like I have

3539.74 --> 3545.91
to perform I have to perform and it was

3543.13 --> 3545.9100000000003
very heavy

3555.18 --> 3563.2
going off to summer camp for the first

3557.62 --> 3565.48
time yeah yeah well the first time I

3563.2 --> 3568.81
basically went somewhere for a prolonged

3565.48 --> 3570.7
period without my parents that was

3568.81 --> 3573.91
