greyness doesn't seem to be any

142.879 --> 148.28
wind there's moist in the

145.28 --> 151.76
air feels like water cold it's probably

148.28 --> 151.76
1 or 2° c

151.879 --> 156.2
it like it really was cold when it got

163.8 --> 167.04000000000002
up all

168.72 --> 175.879
right so it's Tuesday the 5th of

173.239 --> 175.879
November

177.319 --> 184.39999999999998
2023 temperature

181.159 --> 184.4
oh 3°

187.12 --> 191.68
c oh and now there's no snow coming

190.319 --> 196.159

predictions it it just got oh no more

196.159 --> 203.159
snow no more freezing either entirely

200.44 --> 205.64
right so I guess I had that one little

203.159 --> 207.0
bit of snow when was it two days ago in

205.64 --> 211.67999999999998
the

207.0 --> 211.68
evening and that's it

213.319 --> 219.0
typical

214.92 --> 221.83999999999997
uh hello teret 306 first in chat akumu

219.0 --> 221.84
virus good to see

223.519 --> 229.92000000000002
you 5 December

226.319 --> 229.92
yeah did I say

232.56 --> 238.68
third yeah it is it is the 5th of

236.0 --> 242.92
December that's

238.68 --> 242.92000000000002
right is that fifth now

243.04 --> 250.92
oh right sorry mix it

247.68 --> 254.28
up yeah it is 5th of December it's like

250.92 --> 255.95899999999997
that Center Classen Day by the way it's

254.28 --> 258.759
the day of St Nicholas here in the

255.959 --> 259.72
Netherlands so everybody that has family

258.759 --> 264.44
with

259.72 --> 267.12
children is probably getting ready for

264.44 --> 270.28
package evening as they call

267.12 --> 272.0
it traditionally

270.28 --> 276.11999999999995
it's an in the evening so that

272.0 --> 279.4
everybody's like home from work and then

276.12 --> 282.68
like either before or after dinner it's

279.4 --> 286.79999999999995
like uh

282.68 --> 290.56
yeah traditionally reading

286.8 --> 290.56
poetry and opening

293.919 --> 300.4
packages so when I was young like it's

298.52 --> 305.79999999999995
basically my parents would

300.4 --> 309.039
write uh basic poetry Rhymes it's like

305.8 --> 309.919
yeah it's it's supposed to be funny or

309.039 --> 313.8
like

309.919 --> 316.59999999999997
really poetic all depends on the person

313.8 --> 321.28000000000003
right So eventually like when you grow

316.6 --> 324.36
up a bit more parents say like hey uh

321.28 --> 328.31899999999996
yeah we actually write the Poetry

324.36 --> 330.56
so you got to figure out pres and poetry

328.319 --> 333.40000000000003
for other family members MERS too and

330.56 --> 335.96
like oh okay and then eventually you

333.4 --> 338.56
just start recognizing the the gift by

335.96 --> 342.56
the the style of

338.56 --> 345.68
poetry right but that's kind of like

342.56 --> 345.68
Yeah The Dutch

345.88 --> 350.24
tradition you actually have to make a

348.0 --> 351.759
little effort for it like with writing

350.24 --> 357.44
the

351.759 --> 361.47900000000004
Poetry instead of just like oh presence

357.44 --> 361.479
yeah I want to play with it

363.6 --> 371.72
yeah like with Santa

366.8 --> 371.72
Claus uh hello borders

374.16 --> 381.96000000000004
boy had an imp meeting what what is that

378.16 --> 381.96000000000004
meaning important meeting

383.68 --> 386.68
is

388.4 --> 391.4
what

393.639 --> 397.199
okay yeah sure

399.96 --> 404.52
tet hey I'm always up for

417.24 --> 421.879
questioning you're there quick right

419.639 --> 424.72
away I'm still in the middle of waking

421.879 --> 427.199
up rather like warming

424.72 --> 429.16
up it is kind of cold here I have the

427.199 --> 433.24
door closed I got the heater here it's

429.16 --> 433.24
I'm my hand is still freaking

440.72 --> 447.16
freezing you've trained yourself for two

444.4 --> 449.919
to 3 years to not wake

447.16 --> 452.08000000000004
up using alarms

449.919 --> 453.35999999999996
actually because I stopped using my old

452.08 --> 456.35999999999996
Samsung

453.36 --> 458.759
Tab and which

456.36 --> 462.319
yeah that's so funny that you're saying

458.759 --> 465.319
that teret because I'm kind of the

462.319 --> 468.199
same my old telephone

465.319 --> 473.08000000000004
had you could literally just insert

468.199 --> 476.159
whatever MP3 to use as an alarm clock or

473.08 --> 478.8
when you rang up was amazing awesome

476.159 --> 481.08
this new freaking thing can't do any of

478.8 --> 483.36
those things it's so terrible actually I

481.08 --> 486.479
can't even just normally turn the alarm

483.36 --> 490.08000000000004
off to without going into the system

486.479 --> 493.159
settings mean what kind of a ridiculous

490.08 --> 494.35999999999996
alarm can't just be turned off for the

493.159 --> 497.28
day

494.36 --> 499.879
serious it annoys me so I've just

497.28 --> 503.08
stopped using it and I'm actually I've

499.879 --> 506.319
been going on intuition too for like the

503.08 --> 506.31899999999996
last what is it half

507.319 --> 512.159
year and it actually worked works out

509.8 --> 514.12
great on average I mean yeah I tend to

512.159 --> 515.8
be a little bit late but I mean I tended

514.12 --> 517.44
to be a little bit late even when I did

515.8 --> 520.88
have alarm

517.44 --> 523.36
clocks when I was still using it so

520.88 --> 525.279
that's not what it's about that's not

523.36 --> 527.839
why I'm late

525.279 --> 529.36
always it's just because it's very hard

527.839 --> 531.9590000000001
for me to

529.36 --> 536.279
aim like to prepare up to that moment

531.959 --> 538.1999999999999
and then often unexpected things happen

536.279 --> 541.2
and then it takes

538.2 --> 541.2
longer

551.92 --> 559.399
anyway yeah I agree teret it does depend

556.44 --> 563.6
on the nature of the alarm

559.399 --> 563.6
though what type of alarm it

563.959 --> 572.4799999999999
is if it's if it's a shock alarm like a

568.2 --> 575.399
traumatic feeling to to jump you out of

572.48 --> 577.76
it yeah that works but that indeed that

575.399 --> 582.04
can be traumatizing over

577.76 --> 584.8389999999999
time but if you you can find if you have

582.04 --> 587.88
that option very specific

584.839 --> 592.6
songs that would really wake you up in a

587.88 --> 592.6
positive way and then use

598.12 --> 603.279
those

600.12 --> 605.36
but I agree like when I was much younger

603.279 --> 608.519
I used like one of those typical alarm

605.36 --> 611.32
clocks with just the you plug in the

608.519 --> 614.12
wall with the digital letters and all

611.32 --> 617.0790000000001
that and that those alarms make like

614.12 --> 617.079
horrendous

619.519 --> 624.64
noise like a macb going off next to

625.68 --> 630.2399999999999
you or

628.04 --> 634.12
something

630.24 --> 635.6
but the not worse actually but that like

634.12 --> 639.12
that was

635.6 --> 639.12
terrible on my

639.6 --> 646.12
mood like I would typically dread the

643.44 --> 648.839
mornings because well I would typically

646.12 --> 652.16
feel kind of sickish in the morning and

648.839 --> 654.519
then there's that blasted alarm

652.16 --> 656.8
clock that I would associate with the

654.519 --> 656.8
early

658.04 --> 661.04
morning

662.639 --> 669.5600000000001
oh God B why do you always bring that up

665.32 --> 670.9590000000001
whatever um I feel like a doctor now

669.56 --> 674.2399999999999
people only bring up their bowel

670.959 --> 674.2399999999999
movements to their doctor

684.16 --> 690.56
usually yeah that's a good point yeah

686.88 --> 692.639
it's the freezing up right

690.56 --> 695.5999999999999
it's like if you wake up naturally then

692.639 --> 697.12
your body had like time to prepare you

695.6 --> 700.88
for waking

697.12 --> 702.639
up so that every it's like when you wake

700.88 --> 705.4399999999999
up without an alarm clock and you train

702.639 --> 709.16
yourself it's almost like when you go to

705.44 --> 712.0790000000001
work somebody starts the car up like 2

709.16 --> 714.16
minutes before you step in just so the

712.079 --> 716.519
engine's all warmed up that's kind of

714.16 --> 716.519
what it's

717.959 --> 724.279
like that's what you mean

721.32 --> 728.2
right hello BS

724.279 --> 731.279
boy you wake up with the Sun what about

728.2 --> 731.279
if it's completely

733.21 --> 738.5
[Music]

742.64 --> 747.02
[Music]

747.88 --> 750.88
clouded

752.03 --> 756.88
[Music]

753.56 --> 760.04
right yeah sounds good T I

756.88 --> 762.639
mean I'm not like I am definitely not

760.04 --> 766.5999999999999
eager for food first thing in the

762.639 --> 769.6
morning or when I wake up right

766.6 --> 771.36
away I kind of like force myself to just

769.6 --> 773.9590000000001
take my morning

771.36 --> 777.839
supplements but sometimes even those

773.959 --> 781.8
just don't sit well on a bare

777.839 --> 783.32
stomach an empty stomach

781.8 --> 787.4799999999999
but

783.32 --> 791.0400000000001
just I'm not too hungry it's when I kept

787.48 --> 793.04
going like during the show it's like oh

791.04 --> 795.76
it's like yeah it finally starts flowing

793.04 --> 797.56
and everything like I don't have any

795.76 --> 799.48
like hiccups

797.56 --> 802.3199999999999
quirks from

799.48 --> 805.0790000000001
sleepiness and then I get hungry then

802.32 --> 809.6800000000001
it's like where is that

805.079 --> 813.6389999999999
Illuminati right it's right there

809.68 --> 817.8389999999999
but not right away like I do

813.639 --> 820.6800000000001
like all the preparations and like my

817.839 --> 821.639
hair and whatever I brush my teeth

820.68 --> 824.92
before the

821.639 --> 831.84
show do all of that before I

824.92 --> 831.8399999999999
[Music]

835.959 --> 841.1199999999999
eat yes Tommy yeah you're going to have

838.36 --> 844.88
to actually excuse ter it's an Indian

841.12 --> 847.8
thing I think I or maybe it's just

844.88 --> 849.88
him it's funnier to say it's an Indian

847.8 --> 854.24
thing cuz tera's really the only one

849.88 --> 854.24
that's that upfront about it without any

855.839 --> 859.8800000000001
reservations I don't think like flat

857.92 --> 863.519
Arthur is that up

859.88 --> 863.519
front I think it's just

863.8 --> 870.68
teret but I mean that way at least

866.639 --> 870.6800000000001
information gets gets

876.44 --> 881.6800000000001
[Music]

879.16 --> 884.0
shared find sleeping with the curtains

881.68 --> 886.519
open well that's kind of funny you say

884.0 --> 890.0
that b boy because technically my

886.519 --> 893.5600000000001
curtains are partially open ironically

890.0 --> 895.92
it's because my curtains simply aren't

893.56 --> 899.959
wide enough to cover the

895.92 --> 905.12
entire wall so there's always like this

899.959 --> 906.68
amount of space left over and yes I use

905.12 --> 909.68
that

906.68 --> 912.399
too if it would be completely dark I

909.68 --> 914.199
might get trouble waking up like that

912.399 --> 916.759
like if it would have been completely

914.199 --> 919.279
darken but I do sleep through it in the

916.759 --> 919.279
morning

922.36 --> 930.5600000000001
though I mean I can go to bed at

926.12 --> 932.6
4 not recommended but it happens and

930.56 --> 936.92
then it's like yeah I sleep perfectly

932.6 --> 940.399
fine and then I wake up like maybe 10 or

936.92 --> 943.36
11 linger a

940.399 --> 947.88
bit but I mean that it was probably

943.36 --> 947.88
light between 5 and 6

948.36 --> 953.72
already so it's not even like oh the

950.8 --> 956.7589999999999
light comes I wake up no no

953.72 --> 959.399
no but I think that the light does

956.759 --> 961.12
somehow help with your atun

959.399 --> 963.36
like your subconscious Attunement

961.12 --> 966.6
process of waking

963.36 --> 971.0790000000001
up it's like if it's there then like

966.6 --> 973.759
your system can like like okay let's get

971.079 --> 973.7589999999999
ready to wake

975.44 --> 980.44
up right it's just like when you for

978.24 --> 982.399
whatever reason sleep and it's at night

980.44 --> 984.639
when you wake up you can feel like

982.399 --> 986.959
really drowsy because it's all dark

984.639 --> 986.9590000000001
around

987.519 --> 990.519
you

997.68 --> 1003.279
anyway you don't go around telling

1000.36 --> 1007.0
everybody about it yes but but you do

1003.279 --> 1009.12
hear in the chat though it's cool tet I

1007.0 --> 1009.12
get

1010.13 --> 1016.869
[Music]

1017.48 --> 1026.109
it

1019.08 --> 1026.1090000000002
[Music]

1028.799 --> 1032.76
come

1029.72 --> 1036.72
on get warm

1032.76 --> 1039.16
room like I'm still when I move my hand

1036.72 --> 1042.4
around like it literally cools off from

going to night shifts can be brutal I

1076.0 --> 1080.4
mean yes

1082.799 --> 1086.0
I wouldn't last on night

1086.72 --> 1093.84
shifts like I would only last on night

1089.52 --> 1098.6399999999999
shift if one I wasn't cold all that time

1093.84 --> 1101.52

1098.64 --> 1103.2
really active stuff I mean yeah I stay

1101.52 --> 1106.799
up late at night but it's not like oh

1103.2 --> 1111.32
I'm like oh super busy doing no no I'm

1106.799 --> 1111.32
like kind of low energy mode

1113.24 --> 1119.1200000000001
mostly it's like giving my mind some

1116.4 --> 1121.48
space but I'm not super active or

1119.12 --> 1125.2399999999998
anything if I'd be super active I'd

1121.48 --> 1126.77
probably be stressing my body out

1125.24 --> 1132.21
anyway

1126.77 --> 1132.21
[Music]

1137.32 --> 1140.32
right

1152.2 --> 1155.28
right anyway good to see you

1157.159 --> 1162.2800000000002
all yesterday's Flat Earth debate was a

1159.84 --> 1165.28
blast by the way don't know if anybody's

1162.28 --> 1166.28
seen it like even the live show lasted

1165.28 --> 1168.72
very

1166.28 --> 1171.9189999999999
long I think it was like a 2our live

1168.72 --> 1177.679
show or something and then after that

1171.919 --> 1180.0800000000002
guys it went on till 800 p.m. my time

1177.679 --> 1182.96
like this was like a 4 and a half hour

1180.08 --> 1186.76
show I think total

1182.96 --> 1190.32
crazy it last very

1186.76 --> 1192.679
long but like lots of people in there

1190.32 --> 1194.96
everybody was there and everybody was

1192.679 --> 1194.96
very

1196.36 --> 1200.6399999999999
energetic and later in the evening even

1198.96 --> 1203.039
qwi went live again with another

1200.64 --> 1205.3200000000002
treatment out of

1203.039 --> 1207.44
nowhere I didn't watch all of that

1205.32 --> 1209.84
because it was just too late and like

1207.44 --> 1213.3600000000001
I'm like I'm not going to stay up past 4

1209.84 --> 1213.36
again not doing

1218.0 --> 1224.76
it but I did listen to some of it and it

1220.96 --> 1229.28
was just typical and hilarious

1224.76 --> 1233.1589999999999
and like Qi just choking on his own

1229.28 --> 1234.93
laugh after playing another 1 second of

1233.159 --> 1236.7990000000002
the

1234.93 --> 1240.1200000000001
[Music]

1236.799 --> 1243.44
video it's so

1240.12 --> 1246.84
typical like moment like like if he says

1243.44 --> 1249.24
that again I'm going to have to take a

1246.84 --> 1252.97
break like I can't deal with this

1249.24 --> 1254.679
anymore it is really

1252.97 --> 1257.84
[Applause]

1254.679 --> 1261.52
funny what's QE treatment QE treatment

1257.84 --> 1265.12
is when qwi is going solo and reviewing

1261.52 --> 1265.12
like an anti flat earther or

1266.08 --> 1272.1999999999998
something that's a qy

1269.44 --> 1274.559
treatment so like a ball busters or a

1272.2 --> 1277.4
qwi live is a panel

1274.559 --> 1279.6399999999999
show where there might be a theme or

1277.4 --> 1282.3200000000002
whatever and you're like everybody's

1279.64 --> 1284.5590000000002
just jumping in with the presentation or

1282.32 --> 1287.039
whatever when he's doing a creat

1284.559 --> 1289.1589999999999
treatment it's just QE

1287.039 --> 1293.36
there

1289.159 --> 1297.7600000000002
like playing a video and flipping

1293.36 --> 1302.7199999999998
out and Yeah laughing his ass off

1297.76 --> 1302.72

1309.08 --> 1316.84
things having crazy descriptions of

1313.159 --> 1319.88
balls with some type of super lethal

1316.84 --> 1322.6399999999999
razor wire wrapped around it up your ass

1319.88 --> 1325.3600000000001
and that's crazy I mean he gets really

1322.64 --> 1325.3600000000001

1328.08 --> 1336.08
descriptions uh but anyway it was it is

1736.399 --> 1743.0
channel do I think I could be a voice

1740.0 --> 1743.0
actor

1744.519 --> 1747.519
maybe

1748.0 --> 1754.36
sure professionally no way I mean I'd

1755.24 --> 1762.519
have like insane amounts of competition

1758.64 --> 1762.519
of people that are better at

1764.12 --> 1773.08
it and younger and much more about like

1767.88 --> 1773.0800000000002
they're just there and I am not

1774.6 --> 1781.36
so oh kwi could be a voice actor oh I

1778.08 --> 1784.0
didn't see that

1781.36 --> 1787.6399999999999
uh

1784.0 --> 1787.64
no absolutely

1788.12 --> 1793.799
not he's just

1791.159 --> 1796.1200000000001
funny he's not a good voice actor dude

1793.799 --> 1798.32
have you heard his freaking singing dude

1796.12 --> 1801.399
it's atrocious

1798.32 --> 1805.399
it like he's just funny that's

1801.399 --> 1805.399
it he's not a good voice

1809.67 --> 1820.2
[Music]

1816.6 --> 1820.1999999999998
actor all right

1826.24 --> 1829.24
anyway

1839.4 --> 1847.51
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1859.24
for

1870.2 --> 1873.76
right by the way

1874.279 --> 1880.12
interesting I guess Tommy re I mean I

1878.24 --> 1882.039
get a lot of trolls that hang around

1880.12 --> 1885.399
pretending to be new

1882.039 --> 1885.399
people but I

1886.159 --> 1896.8400000000001
mean nobody ever asks like who is

1891.559 --> 1896.84
QE which tells me like Tommy's a genuine

1896.919 --> 1901.0800000000002
newcomer and that absolutely does not

1899.36 --> 1904.519
mean he's going to get a wrench because

1901.08 --> 1908.84
nobody gets a new wrench

1904.519 --> 1913.679
now it's all peaceful and

1908.84 --> 1913.6789999999999
perfect I've never been so troll-free

1915.76 --> 1922.6
and oh God they are trying I mean I did

1919.6 --> 1925.84
you know I practically get like whiny

1922.6 --> 1928.279
screechy criticizing emails about my

1925.84 --> 1930.1589999999999
show and my activities like on a daily

1928.279 --> 1935.399
basis

1930.159 --> 1938.96
now like definitely weekly but sometimes

1935.399 --> 1941.799
he sends like three mails a day that end

1938.96 --> 1941.799
up in my spam

1945.08 --> 1951.84
folder right so they are definitely not

1948.159 --> 1954.0800000000002
liking how how I tackled this situation

1951.84 --> 1954.08
with the

1954.519 --> 1959.3990000000001
wrenches they really thought they were

1956.6 --> 1962.559
going to take down my show like that and

1959.399 --> 1962.559
I thought it for a bit

1964.08 --> 1971.08
too but uh yeah it's it's over it's

1967.84 --> 1973.24
finally over it's like the Troll Wars

1971.08 --> 1976.0
are

1973.24 --> 1979.039
over they're still Trolls but they're

1976.0 --> 1979.039
not winning anymore

1980.559 --> 1985.1589999999999
they ain't taking out this channel no

1989.58 --> 1994.36
[Music]

1991.679 --> 1997.5590000000002
more someone takes time out of their day

1994.36 --> 2000.559
yeah kumu virus and they make effort too

1997.559 --> 2003.08
man like some of these trolls they when

2000.559 --> 2005.84
they do it it's like poetry to

2003.08 --> 2007.9189999999999
them these people are [ __ ] insane

2005.84 --> 2012.32
dude like

2007.919 --> 2015.3200000000002
literally probably officially

2012.32 --> 2017.96
insane I bet a lot of these crazy trolls

2015.32 --> 2022.0
are literally doing

2017.96 --> 2025.76
it from within their like internet time

2022.0 --> 2029.679
at the clinic where they're spent like

2025.76 --> 2029.679
regularly in a padded room I

2030.24 --> 2038.96
mean it's got to be that at this

2034.399 --> 2038.9599999999998
point like right like P Mars

2039.0 --> 2045.36
it was suspiciously in that type of

2042.44 --> 2045.3600000000001
situation it

2050.159 --> 2053.159
seems

2065.879 --> 2068.879
anyway

2073.96 --> 2077.01
[Music]

2080.679 --> 2085.96
ah okay teret I haven't watched it

2090.679 --> 2096.7200000000003
yet right but if only you

2093.56 --> 2097.56
know I wish there was a way that I could

2096.72 --> 2100.9199999999996
like

2097.56 --> 2102.7999999999997
transform friction from

2100.92 --> 2106.32
trolls like

2102.8 --> 2106.32
into viable

2106.52 --> 2111.28
energy

2108.119 --> 2113.6400000000003
right like

2111.28 --> 2115.7200000000003
theoretically If a troll just always

2113.64 --> 2118.96
like has to jump at you

2115.72 --> 2122.56
then wouldn't you be able to like

2118.96 --> 2125.52
make Power generating troll

2122.56 --> 2128.72
traps where it's like you're counting on

2125.52 --> 2132.7599999999998
them doing that

2128.72 --> 2137.72
so that every time a troll jumps that it

2132.76 --> 2140.5200000000004
like adds a bit of electrical energy or

2137.72 --> 2143.3199999999997
something but it's all metaphorically of

2140.52 --> 2146.599
course just I wish I could like instead

2143.32 --> 2150.119
of just them and I could just like use

2146.599 --> 2151.1600000000003
them to like power a Dynamo or something

2150.119 --> 2153.96
like a good

2151.16 --> 2155.7999999999997
one one that could actually like produce

2153.96 --> 2158.8
electricity that would be

2155.8 --> 2158.8
cool

2162.079 --> 2167.7200000000003
even better would be if I could just

2164.0 --> 2171.319
somehow make them see their yeah the

2167.72 --> 2171.319
error of their ways

2171.359 --> 2176.319
internally

2173.16 --> 2179.7599999999998
and instead of trolling me realize like

2176.319 --> 2182.72
hey maybe this all these problems are

2179.76 --> 2186.3190000000004
actually solved and instead of just

2182.72 --> 2188.24
nagging and stalking him could just

2186.319 --> 2191.079
support

2188.24 --> 2192.52
him and then all those things I kind of

2191.079 --> 2194.76
like don't

2192.52 --> 2199.079
like about

2194.76 --> 2199.079
him will gradually go

2204.72 --> 2213.3199999999997
away because that's true because it

2209.25 --> 2213.32
[Music]

2215.68 --> 2222.56
would hian I don't

2219.359 --> 2225.2
care yeah but it is kind of like an

2222.56 --> 2225.2
actor's

2225.56 --> 2228.7999999999997
Club these

2234.599 --> 2240.88
trolls they're

2236.64 --> 2243.48
like a theater Club but they don't have

2240.88 --> 2248.56
a theater so they just kind of go around

2243.48 --> 2249.56
and be all theatrical as trolls

2248.56 --> 2251.7599999999998
like

2249.56 --> 2254.0
wow that's what you're doing now with

2251.76 --> 2254.0
your

2254.64 --> 2261.1189999999997
life I mean yeah you could call that art

2258.16 --> 2264.92
but is it really art that anybody

2261.119 --> 2264.92
appreciates anybody what

2275.599 --> 2278.599
you

2280.96 --> 2286.96
they are self-loathing the

2283.4 --> 2286.96
trolls yeah

2289.64 --> 2295.96
mostly and I mean like the perfect

2292.359 --> 2299.7999999999997
example of that is like this one

2295.96 --> 2303.119
guy and like he's just a grumpy old

2299.8 --> 2307.28
[ __ ] he's not really like a a sock

2303.119 --> 2309.599
troll guy he's just it's Ken Lang boys

2307.28 --> 2313.92
or something You' probably seen him

2309.599 --> 2319.96
around he's like oh look at you

2313.92 --> 2324.76
Baldi and I'm like uh dude look at your

2319.96 --> 2327.56
hair of that photo of you on your

2324.76 --> 2329.6400000000003
account my hair is freaking better than

2327.56 --> 2333.24
you dude what the [ __ ] are you whining

2329.64 --> 2338.1189999999997
about my terrible hair and then he

2333.24 --> 2341.5989999999997
absolutely shut up after that moment

2338.119 --> 2344.2400000000002
but yes they are self-loathing and they

2341.599 --> 2346.88
continually do that so it's probably all

2344.24 --> 2350.72
these people they like oh balls with

2346.88 --> 2353.359
look at hair reing it's just projection

2350.72 --> 2356.24
it's like they've went through that it

2353.359 --> 2359.04
was super painful to them they're now

2356.24 --> 2361.64
just a bunch of

2359.04 --> 2364.599
of a bald

2361.64 --> 2367.16
golems and they're just stuck in that

2364.599 --> 2369.839
memory of their hair fall falling out

2367.16 --> 2371.44
and then when they see May oh my God

2369.839 --> 2374.44
they're getting triggered because it's

2371.44 --> 2378.2000000000003
reminds them of their hair rapidly

2374.44 --> 2382.839
falling out and them turning into a

2378.2 --> 2386.72
Golem right but it's not happening it's

2382.839 --> 2388.88
kind of been like this for two decades

2386.72 --> 2391.7599999999998

2388.88 --> 2394.28
little but I mean it's so freaking slow

2391.76 --> 2396.92
I'll still have hair lots of hair

2394.28 --> 2399.3190000000004

2399.319 --> 2407.319
to have long hair that's going to look

2401.88 --> 2411.1600000000003

2873.68 --> 2881.2799999999997
out how to get me to sympathize with

2876.68 --> 2884.64
them then so be it then let him be an

2881.28 --> 2887.92
attempt at an infiltrant to get me to

2884.64 --> 2890.48
like him I like him it succeeded yeah

2887.92 --> 2893.079
he's never going to get a wrench

2890.48 --> 2894.76
though yeah so there's literally nothing

2893.079 --> 2898.96
to worry

2894.76 --> 2900.96
about and I find him to be

2898.96 --> 2903.319
overall

2900.96 --> 2906.0
like not

2903.319 --> 2909.68
malignant you might have moods hey is a

2906.0 --> 2909.68
human being human beings have

2909.76 --> 2915.1600000000003
moods but uh I don't give a [ __ ] if he's

2912.72 --> 2916.2799999999997
an infiltrator because he's not getting

2915.16 --> 2919.04
a

2916.28 --> 2921.8
wrench I just happen to like his

2919.04 --> 2924.5589999999997

2921.8 --> 2927.4

comments I like it how other people

2927.4 --> 2934.119
respond to his silly comments there's

2929.4 --> 2934.119
something to it something

2934.599 --> 2941.079
unique

2936.64 --> 2944.799
very very unlike other anti-flat

2941.079 --> 2947.28
earthers and so I don't care if he's an

2944.799 --> 2949.68
infiltrate let him infiltrate he's not

2947.28 --> 2949.6800000000003
getting a

2961.799 --> 2967.359
wrench that you were right what I don't

2964.48 --> 2968.92
give a [ __ ] if somebody's [ __ ]

2967.359 --> 2971.4
enough to make that much effort to

2968.92 --> 2975.2400000000002
create a fake character that's going to

2971.4 --> 2978.88
hang around on a regular

2975.24 --> 2981.9199999999996
basis well that's almost like art

2978.88 --> 2984.48
then and I mean the act that is

2981.92 --> 2987.2000000000003
completely acted together doesn't seem

2984.48 --> 2989.119
malignant so like yeah let somebody like

2987.2 --> 2992.48
dedicate that much

2989.119 --> 2996.48
energy and their internal flexibility

2992.48 --> 2997.44
just to act a non-malignant strange

2996.48 --> 3002.72

people and he's going to be around in

3077.119 --> 3085.52
this chat making his silly

3080.88 --> 3090.4

3192.04 --> 3197.319
suspect or let's just say there is a a

3194.92 --> 3200.92
Quantum chance that I can't figure out

3197.319 --> 3203.04
until I can and most of you are probably

dupons is some [ __ ] fake account or

3356.0 --> 3359.88
whatever or whatever he thinks he's

3770.88 --> 3777.319
torturing them about their selfworth

3775.72 --> 3779.4399999999996
and it's just so much that they just

3777.319 --> 3782.52
need to find people that are showing

3779.44 --> 3785.76
traces of slight hair loss so they could

3782.52 --> 3788.359
just imagine their nightmares projected

3785.76 --> 3790.559
onto them I think it's really that I

4035.839 --> 4038.0789999999997
my

4040.62 --> 4048.4
[Music]

4042.92 --> 4048.4
hair like I like the way it feels on my

4048.48 --> 4054.559
head hairs are arguably like

4051.799 --> 4057.2
sensors they like double function is

4054.559 --> 4060.48
like sensory

4057.2 --> 4063.16
equipment you can feel like pressure

4060.48 --> 4065.319
change and

4063.16 --> 4070.0389999999998
electrostatics and all these kinds of

4065.319 --> 4072.7599999999998
things better with long hair literally

4070.039 --> 4072.76
that's not a

4072.92 --> 4075.92
myth

4079.039 --> 4085.039
like hairs are arguably like antennas

4081.92 --> 4088.559
too oh talking about which yesterday's

4085.039 --> 4090.92
show yeah people explained to me like

4088.559 --> 4092.76
how is a giant Stone pillar going to

4090.92 --> 4096.96
function like an

4092.76 --> 4100.64
antenna and to be fair I was kind of

4096.96 --> 4103.4800000000005
like free floating with the

4100.64 --> 4105.719
idea so it was all rough I hadn't

4103.48 --> 4108.599999999999
actually like engine it's not like oh my

4105.719 --> 4111.839
God this is like the most sophisticated

4108.6 --> 4114.1990000000005
engineering secret I've ever discovered

4111.839 --> 4116.4
no it was just like an idea like why the

4114.199 --> 4119.12
hell would they build those things

4116.4 --> 4121.4
unless it was like

4119.12 --> 4124.799
functional like an

4121.4 --> 4126.3589999999995
antenna which it kind of reminds me of

4124.799 --> 4129.0
but I mean yeah

4126.359 --> 4131.400000000001
Stone you have to like really do

4129.0 --> 4132.88
something weird with stone in order for

4131.4 --> 4134.679
it to be able to function like an

4132.88 --> 4137.1990000000005
antenna

4134.679 --> 4141.96
so maybe it would have worked but then

4137.199 --> 4141.96
like in a state of super high energy or

4142.52 --> 4147.92
something so people had some criticism

4145.239 --> 4150.959999999999
about that like oh my God you're such a

4147.92 --> 4153.2390000000005
terrible engineer you know you need

4150.96 --> 4156.359
metal for

4153.239 --> 4160.639999999999
that and like yeah sorry I didn't think

4156.359 --> 4160.64
about it on the Fly that

4160.96 --> 4165.92
deeply it was just free range

4163.88 --> 4168.4800000000005
speculation and I thought it was it's

4165.92 --> 4170.759
still like I thought yesterday was in a

4168.48 --> 4173.04
very interesting hangout because of just

4170.759 --> 4176.4
all the ways of looking at it like you

4173.04 --> 4180.0
can look at the pyramids and all these

4176.4 --> 4181.799
architectural traits that are involved

4180.0 --> 4184.279
differently you can look at it like a

4181.799 --> 4188.199
machine and it's really really

4184.279 --> 4191.319
fascinating to do that because that's

4188.199 --> 4194.04
something that's just not told about it

4191.319 --> 4195.96
when it seems very obvious that pyramid

4194.04 --> 4200.56
and all these Stone

4195.96 --> 4202.92
things are like engineered they're like

4200.56 --> 4204.6
engineering they're machines they're

4202.92 --> 4208.4400000000005
they have a

4204.6 --> 4210.05
function they're not just

4208.44 --> 4213.219999999999
decoration right

4238.12 --> 4243.88

4240.8 --> 4246.320000000001

4290.32 --> 4296.759999999999
that Nathan hasn't had any computer

4293.4 --> 4299.199
problems did anybody notice

4296.76 --> 4301.4800000000005
like like in the last week it's just

4299.199 --> 4304.4
been

4301.48 --> 4306.32
like he's just been testing and testing

4304.4 --> 4307.48
and testing and just this computer just

4306.32 --> 4310.679
won't break

4307.48 --> 4314.5599999999995
down so it's like things are looking

4310.679 --> 4317.32

5122.159 --> 5127.28
make you pay for that attitude and then

I'm like like no you're

5127.28 --> 5133.4
not I might be small but my arms are

5130.159 --> 5135.638999999999

5151.48 --> 5155.04
mean it's happened multiple times and

5153.199 --> 5157.919999999999

seriously badass because it is and that

5161.92 --> 5167.4400000000005

5167.44 --> 5174.08
respect you or get really scared from

5198.76 --> 5201.52
you get tired

5207.96 --> 5214.199
out right but you need to be very quick

to be able to do that so

5215.28 --> 5221.759999999999

did you that actually going to be

5373.239 --> 5378.32
are just all

5375.719 --> 5380.6
fake I think it's all

5378.32 --> 5383.48
fake I think they're just like oh we're

5380.6 --> 5385.4800000000005
just doing it and like none of it is

5383.48 --> 5388.0
real except for those people that are

5385.48 --> 5390.0
just like oh my God we can't escape it

5388.0 --> 5393.04
so we better just write that curve when

5390.0 --> 5395.88
it's still fresh I don't I think that

5393.04 --> 5398.679
those people are the only

people that are going to be subjected to

5398.679 --> 5405.4400000000005
anything to any of

5401.679 --> 5407.6
this I think it's like literally all

5405.44 --> 5410.199
fake oh we're going to do this thing and

5407.6 --> 5414.280000000001
do that thing and it's like yeah but I'm

5410.199 --> 5414.28
not and you're still going to be

5416.08 --> 5422.159
fine right it's just the same nonsense

5419.0 --> 5424.119
as oh you need the co pass you need to

5422.159 --> 5427.36
special past you need to be up to date

5424.119 --> 5430.32
to do have the special event I think

5427.36 --> 5432.719
it's just more of that nonsense I bet

5430.32 --> 5432.719
you it

5435.48 --> 5443.08
is it's like

5439.08 --> 5444.6
more opportunities for people

5443.08 --> 5449.96
to

5444.6 --> 5453.84
exchange physical luxuries or

5449.96 --> 5453.84

no dude tactical soap friend

bro what it I mean I

5473.4 --> 5478.32

5478.52 --> 5484.96

5489.4 --> 5493.759999999999
like kill half the world's

5495.88 --> 5503.04

5498.0 --> 5505.159
yeah let's just say I wasn't planning on

5503.04 --> 5507.4
taking any type of

5505.159 --> 5510.599999999999
shots after

5507.4 --> 5510.599999999999

5510.76 --> 5513.76
know

5516.239 --> 5522.839999999999
is there some natural sh what are you

5518.8 --> 5522.84
talking about of course there's natural

5529.8 --> 5535.6
shampoo profiling purposes possibly and

5534.119 --> 5538.599999999999
getting genetic

5535.6 --> 5538.6
samples

5539.199 --> 5544.159
G but it was Al it's like most multiple

5542.32 --> 5546.759999999999
all these things are all multiple

5544.159 --> 5549.08
reasons because none of them actually

5546.76 --> 5551.2390000000005
function for what they say they function

5549.08 --> 5553.8
because that can't

5551.239 --> 5555.879999999999
work so everything that's been done has

5553.8 --> 5557.4400000000005
been done for multiple reasons for

5555.88 --> 5560.1990000000005
social

5557.44 --> 5563.199
conditioning like obedience

5560.199 --> 5563.199
conditioning

5564.159 --> 5569.879999999999
and yeah the sell more products

5570.639 --> 5573.639
related

5585.92 --> 5588.88
right but I mean when it comes to things

5587.48 --> 5591.159
like

5588.88 --> 5596.159000000001
profiling They Don't

5591.159 --> 5596.159
Really they wouldn't need to do it like

5596.199 --> 5599.799999999999
that right I

5600.199 --> 5604.36
mean they want profiling they just get a

5603.199 --> 5608.36
blood

5604.36 --> 5611.719
sample I mean who in their life after

5608.36 --> 5615.08
like age of six or something has never

5611.719 --> 5617.56
given a hospital a blood

5615.08 --> 5620.4
sample

5617.56 --> 5622.159000000001
right like what do you mean like oh

5620.4 --> 5624.0
we're going to do this and then get your

5622.159 --> 5626.44
sample like what do you mean they

5624.0 --> 5629.88
already have all of

5626.44 --> 5629.879999999999
that most of

5630.56 --> 5633.56
it

5646.0 --> 5651.199
they CRI mask wanted all vets to get vac

5648.92 --> 5652.4400000000005
yeah yeah because W yeah you just want

5651.199 --> 5657.0
them all

5652.44 --> 5657.0
dead yeah they don't want any

5659.84 --> 5668.84
vets they just want to die

5664.56 --> 5671.080000000001
quickly right to save tax dollars while

5668.84 --> 5674.159000000001
the elite literally just

5671.08 --> 5677.199
spends billions of times more and just

5674.159 --> 5679.599999999999
throws it away to complete lost

5677.199 --> 5682.678999999999
projects but I mean to get some of that

5679.6 --> 5686.04
money back they need to

5682.679 --> 5686.04
save on

5687.8 --> 5693.320000000001
vets

5690.48 --> 5699.44
right

5693.32 --> 5702.719
now if I were vets I I'd start forming a

5699.44 --> 5705.199
specific political party Al together and

5702.719 --> 5708.4
then try to turn the roles around and

5705.199 --> 5711.199
say like hey maybe we just don't need

5708.4 --> 5711.199
politicians

5713.96 --> 5720.679
anymore like what if you just don't have

5716.84 --> 5722.52
them anymore at all like zero no

5720.679 --> 5725.36
politicians

5722.52 --> 5727.119000000001
just none

5725.36 --> 5730.04
only the

5727.119 --> 5730.88
Constitution like only the Constitution

5730.04 --> 5735.88
and

5730.88 --> 5738.719
people that might be hired to do some

5735.88 --> 5741.679
tasks like a a corporation for the

5738.719 --> 5743.6
public which is really government right

5741.679 --> 5745.4800000000005
just get back to that but you got to get

5743.6 --> 5748.400000000001
rid of the politicians first right

5745.48 --> 5748.4
before they get rid of

5750.4 --> 5753.759999999999
you

5752.08 --> 5756.28
and I mean it's not like they don't

5753.76 --> 5756.280000000001
deserve

5768.88 --> 5775.36
it skeptical of every Theory relating to

5772.04 --> 5775.36
DNA yeah

5780.32 --> 5783.32
duh

5787.44 --> 5793.759999999999
yeah would working going to be I mean

5789.239 --> 5796.5599999999995
the whole 2020 and it was everybody went

5793.76 --> 5802.2390000000005
completely AP

5796.56 --> 5803.92
[ __ ] there was like just a like a flash

5802.239 --> 5806.839999999999
Panic

5803.92 --> 5810.28
hysteria that was being pushed super I

5806.84 --> 5812.0
mean people were like psychologically

5810.28 --> 5814.5599999999995
assaulted

5812.0 --> 5818.48
through media and this is

5814.56 --> 5820.159000000001
not like fear porn they were

5818.48 --> 5823.839999999999
psychologically

5820.159 --> 5826.5599999999995
assaulted like nothing I've ever

5823.84 --> 5829.08
witnessed and anybody that didn't have

5826.56 --> 5831.96
the good instinct to just turn off the

5829.08 --> 5834.92
screens they got all got [ __ ] they all

5831.96 --> 5834.92
got [ __ ] in the

5840.199 --> 5846.08
head and lots of them arguably died

5843.56 --> 5846.080000000001
because of

5847.36 --> 5853.88
that because they got [ __ ] in the head

5850.719 --> 5855.639
to like there's a war broken out except

5853.88 --> 5857.2390000000005
the war psychological and the

5855.639 --> 5859.4800000000005
psychological

5857.239 --> 5862.5199999999995
perpetrator is telling you this is what

5859.48 --> 5865.5199999999995
you have to do to make an end and that

5862.52 --> 5867.96
thing that you have to do to make an end

5865.52 --> 5870.719
well if you look into that or if you

5867.96 --> 5872.32
have some wider knowledge is exactly the

5870.719 --> 5876.4800000000005
thing that's going to to get you

5872.32 --> 5876.48
killed that's the psychological

5876.88 --> 5884.679
warfare yeah there's no biological

5880.159 --> 5886.719
warfare there's no freaking germ or

5884.679 --> 5889.8
whatever the [ __ ] they claim it's

5886.719 --> 5893.4800000000005
supposed to be spreading around it was

5889.8 --> 5897.360000000001
all psychological

5893.48 --> 5900.199
warfare and then at the end of the ride

5897.36 --> 5902.32
if the psychological warfare succeeded

5900.199 --> 5905.08
convince the person

5902.32 --> 5908.5599999999995
there is the medical

5905.08 --> 5911.92
experiment which first off well will

5908.56 --> 5915.84
lead to eventual euthanization but

5911.92 --> 5919.719
also give this opportunity for for like

5915.84 --> 5922.92
wildly new medical

5919.719 --> 5924.8
testings like imp like implanting

5922.92 --> 5925.96
Monsters just to see what happens kind

5924.8 --> 5928.400000000001
of

5925.96 --> 5929.92
thing so they got that out of it right

5928.4 --> 5932.239
they could just do that research all

5929.92 --> 5934.28
they had to do is just Drive everybody

5932.239 --> 5940.04
completely insane and they and they got

5934.28 --> 5940.04
free guinea pigs for their wild lethal

5945.36 --> 5951.429999999999
experimentations right I'm going to get

5946.96 --> 5954.509
my coffee before the show's on be right

5951.43 --> 5954.509
[Music]

6049.76 --> 6053.8
coffee huh your mom was a

6054.239 --> 6058.799999999999
vard

6057.08 --> 6061.199
yeah

6058.8 --> 6064.2390000000005
terrifying I mean my mom might have

6061.199 --> 6067.4
become a vard but probably

6064.239 --> 6072.08
not but I mean the medical system killed

6067.4 --> 6072.08
her before she even got to that you

6072.599 --> 6078.88
know my mother would have had a really

6075.4 --> 6081.239
terrible time she would have become like

6078.88 --> 6083.36
very seriously depressed if she had Tak

6081.239 --> 6085.5199999999995
a notice that the world would be

6083.36 --> 6088.159
assaulted by

6085.52 --> 6088.84
media it would have like really gotten

6088.159 --> 6092.209
to

6088.84 --> 6092.209
[Music]

6097.07 --> 6100.13

6144.679 --> 6150.2390000000005

6199.679 --> 6203.52
title

6203.52 --> 6208.8
comment

it's just been kind of all over the

6210.639 --> 6216.119
place it's not like a a thing that

6212.32 --> 6216.119
really sticks out in in today's

6220.32 --> 6227.0
show didn't get super esoteric either I

6223.92 --> 6227.0
did bring up some

6227.719 --> 6232.679
esoterics but not very elaborately

6241.639 --> 6248.84
what oh not yeah oh right oh that was

6246.8 --> 6253.28
part of the okay fair enough ter I I

6248.84 --> 6255.88
didn't realize that

6253.28 --> 6258.28
ponytails nah I think I'm going to just

6255.88 --> 6258.28
leave it

6259.599 --> 6262.599
blank

6263.599 --> 6267.4400000000005
