225.56 --> 234.439
this this day

228.4 --> 237.079
today in about 6 hours from now flatter

234.439 --> 238.959
Sage I just like yeah we could have

237.079 --> 240.72
probably done it yesterday but I was

238.959 --> 244.2
just like

240.72 --> 246.68
really distracted or distracted I was

244.2 --> 246.67999999999998
just

248.84 --> 254.599
tired and know yeah kind of stopped

251.4 --> 258.759
being so tired in the

254.599 --> 261.12
evening but man just yesterday it was

258.759 --> 263.759
just so slow don't know what the hell

261.12 --> 266.12
that was but yeah today I feel like

263.759 --> 269.08000000000004
that's definitely going to be better

266.12 --> 270.72
and did have a Skype conversation with

269.08 --> 272.96
the

270.72 --> 275.24
this flatter

272.96 --> 277.71999999999997
sage and yeah we're going to have plenty

275.24 --> 277.72
to talk

278.6 --> 283.68
about so yeah I am looking forward to

286.96 --> 293.71999999999997
it right so I got some Tura coffee

295.759 --> 301.28000000000003
here an Illuminati ciss

299.42 --> 302.89000000000004
[Music]

301.28 --> 306.01
looking forward to

302.89 --> 306.01
[Music]

313.16 --> 318.12
that

314.68 --> 318.12
uh hello

318.479 --> 323.639
J Around the Globe no

332.72 --> 336.56
better saying would be on the face of

334.52 --> 341.35999999999996
the

336.56 --> 341.36
earth I always like that saying

347.99 --> 360.379
[Music]

375.25 --> 378.43
[Music]

385.0 --> 390.479
see yeah yesterday was a relatively a

387.639 --> 393.40000000000003
quiet day I spend a lot of it just

390.479 --> 393.4
watching Star Trek

396.8 --> 400.919
Voyager it is an interesting

402.08 --> 406.52
series also I'm noticing like the music

405.08 --> 408.12
is just really

406.52 --> 411.28
good

408.12 --> 414.84000000000003
and reminds me a lot of

411.28 --> 414.84
uh gustaff

417.52 --> 422.96
Hol so I think that lot of it is

420.319 --> 425.84000000000003
actually based on the holster style like

422.96 --> 430.15999999999997
the ways that

425.84 --> 433.84
the sound patterns and like it's so

430.16 --> 437.03900000000004
great because they use the different

433.84 --> 438.919
harmonics for to really set like

437.039 --> 442.31899999999996
complicated

438.919 --> 445.19899999999996
tones which they then also use very

442.319 --> 449.8
effectively like Tinker Tailor to like

445.199 --> 449.8
strange situations like when

450.56 --> 454.759
when you're not entirely sure what's

452.479 --> 456.919
what a group's motives is that they bump

454.759 --> 459.36
into like they

456.919 --> 463.31899999999996
use the music for

459.36 --> 466.039
it they they really do it's very

463.319 --> 468.44
carefully orchestrated like

466.039 --> 471.199
that

468.44 --> 474.52
fascinating but you can in a way tell

471.199 --> 477.24
from the tone of the music like roughly

474.52 --> 481.28
what is probably going to

477.24 --> 484.199
happen but the way it works is like it

481.28 --> 487.479
doesn't like overtly spoil it or

484.199 --> 488.52000000000004
something it it's music is just really

487.479 --> 492.56
well

488.52 --> 495.0
done and I'm enjoying

492.56 --> 497.08
it it's kind of funny because like

495.0 --> 500.319
watching this series is almost like

497.08 --> 502.479
playing the game balers

500.319 --> 506.639
gate the the whole

502.479 --> 509.56
thing because of the music like a big

506.639 --> 514.24
reason that I used to play it so much is

509.56 --> 514.24
the music of it because the music is

515.959 --> 523.1199999999999
great and does also in a way adapt to

519.919 --> 523.12
like the development of the

523.839 --> 528.44
story and it's just like

525.92 --> 533.8389999999999
[Music]

528.44 --> 536.9200000000001
very themed and just effectively

533.839 --> 539.6
composed and yeah Star Trek Voyager just

536.92 --> 542.8389999999999
does that as well

539.6 --> 542.839
I'm just really noticing

542.88 --> 548.959
that all right anyway so yeah that's

546.56 --> 552.2399999999999
part of what I've been

548.959 --> 552.2399999999999
doing in the

559.32 --> 563.839
meantime how the political situation

561.92 --> 566.68
just keeps going and

563.839 --> 569.8800000000001
going does seem to be

566.68 --> 573.88
like it seems like there's Mountain a

569.88 --> 577.12
resistance mounting much more

573.88 --> 579.68
seriously it's it's interesting

577.12 --> 582.44
but yeah we'll see what

579.68 --> 586.04
happens 4th of June is going to be like

582.44 --> 589.519
a really big protest thing is the fourth

586.04 --> 589.519
or was it the eth not

590.399 --> 596.76
sure anyway early June it something's

593.56 --> 599.4799999999999
going to go loose farmers are going to

596.76 --> 602.88
go over to Brussels and like it's going

599.48 --> 605.9200000000001
to be spectacular they've been these

602.88 --> 605.92
channels have been

606.079 --> 613.16
like giving everybody heads up about

609.16 --> 613.16
that for a while for over a

616.56 --> 620.56
month uh

643.24 --> 649.92
yeah let's see let's browse

646.48 --> 652.2
back oh yeah I did watch like also video

649.92 --> 655.1999999999999
from my lunch break

652.2 --> 655.2
yesterday

657.32 --> 665.24
God there's some crazy stuff out

660.8 --> 667.959
there like it really got to me in a way

665.24 --> 672.399
like there are these crazy temples that

667.959 --> 675.3199999999999
are like in the middle of a

672.399 --> 679.8
Mountaintop it's extremely inaccessible

675.32 --> 684.0400000000001
and like that's very

679.8 --> 686.7199999999999
shocking it's basically suggested that

684.04 --> 689.48
maybe that entire Mountain used to be

686.72 --> 690.72
like a

689.48 --> 693.6
a big

690.72 --> 696.839
building I don't agree to that but what

693.6 --> 701.8000000000001
I would agree to is that it might have

696.839 --> 701.8000000000001
been like a Giant Mountain

705.88 --> 711.99
City like very comparable to the big

708.8 --> 713.639
city that they show off in Lord of the

711.99 --> 718.32
[Music]

713.639 --> 718.32
Rings H what's it

719.88 --> 728.079
yeah Minas t

723.76 --> 732.56
t it could have been originally part of

728.079 --> 736.04
that and that that whole building was

732.56 --> 737.8389999999999
basically like it was all trash somehow

736.04 --> 739.959
but I've been thinking about how that

737.839 --> 742.0400000000001
would have been done like was it kind of

739.959 --> 745.4799999999999
like some kind of Sonic resonance weapon

742.04 --> 747.7199999999999
that just crumbled and dtif everything

745.48 --> 751.16
because it doesn't look like it's been

747.72 --> 751.1600000000001
blown up

752.32 --> 758.0
like that would leave the thing marked

754.0 --> 761.36
it looks like it's all just like dusi

758.0 --> 763.199
and it just Falls the sand and that just

761.36 --> 767.839
kind of makes it look like a mountain

763.199 --> 767.8389999999999
range like that so yeah

771.44 --> 776.61
that

773.24 --> 779.72
when when was that

776.61 --> 782.279
[Music]

779.72 --> 784.9200000000001
like that channel really emphasized like

782.279 --> 789.72
the seriousness of like trying to

784.92 --> 793.5999999999999
destroy the remnants of old

789.72 --> 796.1990000000001
tartaria I like the potential lengths

793.6 --> 799.0400000000001
that have already happen that have been

796.199 --> 801.56
gone that have already happened in the

799.04 --> 804.36
past that there might have been just

801.56 --> 804.3599999999999
like

804.399 --> 809.48
colossal City structures that were like

807.199 --> 811.0
incredible architecture that had just

809.48 --> 814.0
been

811.0 --> 814.0
completely

814.76 --> 820.76
annihilated but not just by blowing it

817.56 --> 824.92
up in that sense some of

820.76 --> 827.6
it they do tend to like use Wars to

824.92 --> 830.92
basically direct all fire at such things

827.6 --> 835.48
but even like story what he told me

830.92 --> 838.88
about Stalingrad that it had

835.48 --> 842.32
enormous old structures like underneath

838.88 --> 845.04
it like that there's like tunnel

842.32 --> 847.759
networks with like amazing architecture

845.04 --> 851.399
in there and that like a lot of the war

847.759 --> 855.0790000000001
also took place in there in inside and

851.399 --> 855.079
basically just to destroy

855.12 --> 859.36
everything it yeah it was quite

862.32 --> 867.0400000000001
shocking scientist that walk the earth

865.04 --> 871.04
wrong or just a

867.04 --> 871.04
liar yeah pretty much a liar

872.0 --> 876.16
here CU they call themselves

876.199 --> 881.16
scientists but they don't apply the

878.12 --> 884.6
scientific method

881.16 --> 887.639
so they're wrong about Earth and they're

884.6 --> 891.6
liars about being

887.639 --> 896.32
scientists especially if they are like

891.6 --> 901.0400000000001
thinking associating globe with

896.32 --> 901.0400000000001
science Moxy so yeah

904.48 --> 910.0
yeah laugh it

906.04 --> 910.0
up it's very serious

926.959 --> 932.7589999999999
matter right

929.759 --> 932.759
uh

967.51 --> 970.529
[Music]

973.8 --> 977.56
so I got any more questions for

977.68 --> 988.199
me right anyhow yeah the the format

983.16 --> 988.199
of uh what is it my lunch break

989.959 --> 996.279
it it yeah there's something weird about

992.959 --> 1000.1199999999999
it like the way that he presents it like

996.279 --> 1003.399
it seems a bit rushed sometimes but I

1000.12 --> 1003.399
mean he does lay

1003.68 --> 1010.8389999999999
out complicated

1006.959 --> 1014.279
insights rather rapidly that are worth

1010.839 --> 1019.399
considering and I am I am considering

1014.279 --> 1019.399
it it is titillating me

1022.199 --> 1026.6
so I definitely do appreciate David

1024.319 --> 1029.959
Weiss for basically

1026.6 --> 1031.559
pointing pointing him out for me it's a

1029.959 --> 1033.4
it's an interesting Channel and they

1031.559 --> 1037.8799999999999
have

1033.4 --> 1039.16
like they look around wide to all these

1037.88 --> 1043.16
very

1039.16 --> 1043.16
strange places

1052.7 --> 1055.789
[Music]

1063.2 --> 1069.32
all right yeah but Moxy like typically

1066.16 --> 1071.799
what people that call themselves

1069.32 --> 1075.4399999999998
scientists these days what that

1071.799 --> 1075.44
typically is is just

1075.76 --> 1081.4
like theorists

1079.24 --> 1083.919
theorists that

1081.4 --> 1087.5590000000002
like probably dabble a bit in

1083.919 --> 1089.5590000000002
engineering as well so it's like

1087.559 --> 1091.8799999999999
engineering theorists that that is

1089.559 --> 1096.44
really kind of what people that call

1091.88 --> 1096.44
themselves scientists these days are

1108.53 --> 1112.599
[Music]

1118.71 --> 1121.91
[Music]

1124.0 --> 1131.12
is that it is that it is that the the uh

1127.88 --> 1135.4
the summary of your contribution today

1131.12 --> 1135.3999999999999
Moxy that's it nothing else to

1135.44 --> 1142.52
say I mean your roll out your typical

1138.96 --> 1146.64
trapment question and I just answer it

1142.52 --> 1146.6399999999999
and that's it LOL nothing

1150.0 --> 1155.88
else all right I'm going to take a bite

1152.2 --> 1155.88
out of this cheers

1170.559 --> 1174.6789999999999
hey Clary good to see you

1194.33 --> 1197.71
[Music]

1208.35 --> 1211.52
[Music]

1227.64 --> 1231.64
in for

1251.4 --> 1254.5890000000002
[Music]

1262.08 --> 1265.08
h

1292.48 --> 1297.4
which Step are they ignoring they're

1294.679 --> 1299.64
ignoring the step where it actually

1297.4 --> 1302.919
applies to

1299.64 --> 1305.44
whatever they're theorizing

1302.919 --> 1310.48
about that's where they miss

1305.44 --> 1310.48
it that's where they're ignoring it

1333.64 --> 1338.8400000000001
right so in the first instance what

1335.96 --> 1341.679
supposed scientists that say the Earth

1338.84 --> 1343.48
is a globe are ignoring is that the

1341.679 --> 1346.96
Earth being a globe has nothing to do

1343.48 --> 1351.039
with science at all yet they claim it

1346.96 --> 1355.32
does they hold on to that even

1351.039 --> 1359.919
though the Earth's sphericity

1355.32 --> 1359.9189999999999
alleged is it is a matter of

1362.4 --> 1365.76
geometry not

1375.44 --> 1380.44
science right hello

1390.12 --> 1395.9189999999999
Shah

1391.919 --> 1400.1200000000001
hello the ball's dead

1395.919 --> 1406.3600000000001
nice wow you've been around a long

1400.12 --> 1406.36
time as long as my account has been sh

1415.039 --> 1422.52
you put scientist as an umbrella

1419.039 --> 1426.1589999999999
yeah exactly so

1422.52 --> 1429.12
it's you're using the word scientist

1426.159 --> 1431.3200000000002
which is a method that establish the

1429.12 --> 1434.0
cause of an an effect that has to be a

1431.32 --> 1436.76
naturally occurring phenomenon and you

1434.0 --> 1439.52
use it as an umbrella you take cover

1436.76 --> 1443.679
under it you you claim

1439.52 --> 1443.679
science to a professional

1447.88 --> 1455.3600000000001
field even though what you practically

1450.52 --> 1457.72
do and what you claim has very little if

1455.36 --> 1460.039
anything to do with science and the

1457.72 --> 1463.44
scientific method Moxy yeah that that's

1460.039 --> 1463.44
that's the point

1473.88 --> 1483.0800000000002
so are they all wrong yes

1478.52 --> 1483.08
yeah and I just explained to you

1484.28 --> 1487.839
[Music]

1497.32 --> 1501.36

1541.039 --> 1549.6
H you've been forgotten

1544.64 --> 1549.6000000000001
oh I I do seem to recognize you but I

1550.559 --> 1556.8799999999999
mean over the last eight years I've

1553.76 --> 1561.24
bumped into so many people in the chat

1556.88 --> 1565.5200000000002
that I hope you'll excuse me

1561.24 --> 1565.52
for not remembering any

1567.24 --> 1573.2
specifics but it's good to have you here

1569.72 --> 1573.2
welcome back

1616.24 --> 1619.24
no

1646.799 --> 1649.799
what

1665.159 --> 1670.8400000000001
wow how do you come up with these kinds

1667.64 --> 1670.8400000000001
of names

1715.84 --> 1726.279
I don't know I wouldn't exactly compare

1718.64 --> 1726.279
smithz to centino it's just no

1741.48 --> 1743.84
good

1750.039 --> 1756.48
impression yeah I can do Mr Burns and I

1752.96 --> 1756.48
feel like it

1771.84 --> 1778.1589999999999
I mean Mr Burns like in cartoon lore is

1779.96 --> 1783.679
like one of those

1783.72 --> 1789.08
strange character

1786.039 --> 1791.399
projects in in the general lore of

1789.08 --> 1795.519
people like yeah that's what like an old

1791.399 --> 1797.2399999999998
Rothchild type figure is like in a way

1795.519 --> 1798.88
and then a bit cartoonified and

1797.24 --> 1802.1200000000001
exaggerated

1798.88 --> 1802.1200000000001
but I mean that is how

1803.64 --> 1809.3200000000002
people learn about how those people

1807.039 --> 1813.2
actually

1809.32 --> 1815.6399999999999
are it's one of the few characters in

1813.2 --> 1818.919
like a cartoon series that has like a

1815.64 --> 1823.1200000000001
fully developed

1818.919 --> 1825.44
character that's rather serious how it's

1823.12 --> 1828.4399999999998
developed and of course they do make a

1825.44 --> 1828.44
joke

1832.399 --> 1835.9599999999998
okay I'm still here

1848.679 --> 1857.3200000000002
good you wanted to not be in a box okay

1852.84 --> 1857.32
Shana what does that mean

1877.639 --> 1882.519
internet is crap these nah it's it's

1881.2 --> 1886.6390000000001
just

1882.519 --> 1889.6
the the connector really it's a minor

1886.639 --> 1891.76
issue it just I don't know sometimes I

1889.6 --> 1894.76
think that it's specific like this is a

1891.76 --> 1897.679
thing that just can be done from the

1894.76 --> 1899.799
outside like oh Benjamin has this stuff

1897.679 --> 1903.6000000000001
happening too it's

1899.799 --> 1905.32
like a really weird thing going on that

1903.6 --> 1907.279
really gives you like this mat from

1905.32 --> 1908.76
Quantum of conscious type feeling about

1907.279 --> 1911.6
the whole

1908.76 --> 1913.279
thing and this has been happening since

1911.6 --> 1917.9599999999998
the

1913.279 --> 1922.12
start it's like when you get

1917.96 --> 1925.8400000000001
really focused and in and like the focus

1922.12 --> 1927.4799999999998
starts to draw in like a good form of

1925.84 --> 1930.639
tension

1927.48 --> 1934.1200000000001
then if you like touch upon certain

1930.639 --> 1937.0
subjects or even not yet touch upon them

1934.12 --> 1939.6789999999999
like there's like there's distortions

1937.0 --> 1943.08
happening like the line gets cut off and

1939.679 --> 1946.6000000000001
I wonder sometimes if it happens

1943.08 --> 1946.6
algorithmically in some

1946.84 --> 1951.9599999999998
way and it's a decentralized thing so it

1950.36 --> 1954.6
really makes you think like there's just

1951.96 --> 1957.3600000000001
the devil on the other side just like

1954.6 --> 1958.519
like oh I don't like it where you're go

1957.36 --> 1963.4799999999998
with

1958.519 --> 1963.48
this tighten it disrupt

1973.519 --> 1979.48
it cuz it does typically happen in

1976.399 --> 1982.399
moments when there is is something

1979.48 --> 1984.3600000000001
happening and not like in a moment where

1982.399 --> 1986.2399999999998
it's silent and I'm basically like

1984.36 --> 1989.4399999999998
taking a two-minute break or and like

1986.24 --> 1994.0
it's never happened then anybody notice

1989.44 --> 1995.96
like it has never ever happened when I'm

1994.0 --> 1998.88
on a two-minute break or anything it's

1995.96 --> 2001.799
always in the middle of when I'm

1998.88 --> 2001.7990000000002
actually making a

2006.279 --> 2010.32
point and it work like that with

2008.399 --> 2012.7199999999998
everybody like with Owen Benjamin more

2010.32 --> 2015.36
than anybody I've ever

2012.72 --> 2018.88
seen like as soon as he gets like in the

2015.36 --> 2020.799
risky jokes and then sometimes it's like

2018.88 --> 2023.3990000000001
it's almost too

2020.799 --> 2025.36
much for the grabler or something that's

2023.399 --> 2029.399
why people just say yeah it's grabble

2025.36 --> 2032.76
because when he makes fun of

2029.399 --> 2035.9599999999998
Jews or Israelis or whatever something

2032.76 --> 2039.72
like that stereotypes then it's

2035.96 --> 2039.72
like it starts to get

2040.36 --> 2043.639
squishy and

2044.279 --> 2048.879
squeezed and they like to keep it stuck

2046.76 --> 2052.2
on a loop like right in the middle when

2048.879 --> 2052.2
he's saying something really

2053.04 --> 2056.919
silly it's just so

2058.599 --> 2066.04
typical you are a Jew oh

2062.48 --> 2069.72
okay sorry to hear that no just kidding

2066.04 --> 2069.72
well it could be it all depends

2082.33 --> 2085.48
[Music]

2092.96 --> 2097.079
why do we have big noses

2111.64 --> 2117.92
that is an interesting question I would

2114.0 --> 2122.88
say like maybe because then

2117.92 --> 2125.04
you can smell smell out opportunities is

2122.88 --> 2127.8
better yeah it could go it's very

2125.04 --> 2132.52
stereotypical with it but I mean it is

2127.8 --> 2132.52
kind of a thing so yeah I don't

2140.76 --> 2145.079
know the air is free

2146.8 --> 2150.92
right but for how long you

2153.2 --> 2162.1189999999997
know remember that planet space ball

2158.16 --> 2162.1189999999997
like the air is not free

2163.24 --> 2168.9199999999996
there right if you keep it up ventually

2165.96 --> 2168.92
it won't be free

2171.16 --> 2175.56
anymore H voy by the way good to see

2176.24 --> 2182.52
you oh you know voage Shah okay

2182.98 --> 2186.119
[Music]

2195.0 --> 2199.24
CLE of to okay

2238.16 --> 2245.7999999999997
when I was on fed I was Bart Bart

2242.359 --> 2248.7599999999998
Simpson yeah in a

2245.8 --> 2250.2400000000002
way I was being treated like the young

2248.76 --> 2253.119
guy a

2250.24 --> 2254.24
lot and I'm kind of used to that in

2253.119 --> 2259.88
group

2254.24 --> 2259.8799999999997
dynamic so it's funny that you would say

2266.04 --> 2270.4
that hello Jad good to see

2276.44 --> 2280.48
you for

2311.52 --> 2314.88
we are at fault

2315.96 --> 2319.68
what David Wise

2321.92 --> 2326.8
is well first of like what what do you

2325.079 --> 2330.6400000000003
mean

2326.8 --> 2333.7200000000003
Jewish like he's born from a Jewish

2330.64 --> 2338.0
Family what kind of Jew he's not a

2333.72 --> 2338.0
religious Jew he's a Christian

2339.24 --> 2345.16
so yeah there there comes the

2341.839 --> 2345.16
complication of the

2349.24 --> 2355.839
word right the word Jew is like the word

2352.92 --> 2358.7200000000003
ether what does it actually mean people

2355.839 --> 2361.839
love to use it all the time

2358.72 --> 2365.3999999999996
but do you know what you mean when you

2361.839 --> 2365.4
use the word

2367.64 --> 2372.72
ethnically

2369.56 --> 2374.839
Jewish kind Hitler like to kill oh

2372.72 --> 2378.68
really how do you know that he did

2374.839 --> 2378.68
that that he wanted

2379.52 --> 2383.96
that he had all the Jews in his

2392.92 --> 2401.119
cabinet right and like which

2396.319 --> 2403.359
Hitler the real one or the wartime

2401.119 --> 2405.96
replacement lesbian

2403.359 --> 2409.56
actor cuz that one certainly didn't like

2405.96 --> 2412.659
jeice so it seems

2409.56 --> 2412.659
[Music]

2430.0 --> 2433.24
Jews and religious

2433.319 --> 2439.64
Jews yeah but I mean that means that

2436.319 --> 2439.64
it's not the same thing

2441.359 --> 2448.04
then right so that even proves the the

2444.88 --> 2450.88
proves the point even more like what's a

2448.04 --> 2454.64
Jew you say oh there's this Jew and that

2450.88 --> 2457.4
Jew oh oh really so immediately there is

2454.64 --> 2459.5989999999997
already a dichotomy that you didn't

2457.4 --> 2461.88
specify when you were mentioning the

2459.599 --> 2461.88
word

2466.56 --> 2470.2799999999997
you well that's a

2473.44 --> 2478.88
problem what is a Jew is a difficult

2475.88 --> 2480.6400000000003
question yeah but let's narrow it down

2478.88 --> 2485.76
even

2480.64 --> 2488.92
more when you say the word what do you

2485.76 --> 2491.1600000000003
mean yeah let's not make it about

2488.92 --> 2494.8
philosophy like what is a Jew but what

2491.16 --> 2497.5989999999997
do you actually mean when you use the

2494.8 --> 2500.0
word what is that

2497.599 --> 2503.119
specifically and why aren't you being

2500.0 --> 2506.52
more specific when your first answer as

2503.119 --> 2508.8
to what it is immediately leads to

2506.52 --> 2510.7599999999998
multiple options like why didn't you

2508.8 --> 2513.48
specify that when you use the word in

2510.76 --> 2516.4
the first instance why are you just

2513.48 --> 2519.2400000000002
assuming that oh we'll we'll pick the

2516.4 --> 2519.2400000000002
right one

2524.599 --> 2533.7200000000003
right you usually mean ethnically

2528.359 --> 2533.72
Jewish okay well we didn't know

2542.119 --> 2549.119
that and besides like there's different

2545.839 --> 2549.119
Jewish ethnicity

2550.88 --> 2553.88
is

2554.839 --> 2561.2
yeah so that's still not specific

2579.88 --> 2582.88
what

2585.28 --> 2592.2400000000002
okay ashkanazi right yeah that's one e

2589.16 --> 2595.04
ethnic type of Jew the other one what's

2592.24 --> 2597.16
the other one again

2595.04 --> 2602.0
uh I

2597.16 --> 2602.0
forgot those are the worst wow

2602.72 --> 2607.1189999999997
boy just wow

2614.88 --> 2619.04
yeah sapharic that's the other one that

2617.0 --> 2620.96
I know and there's more

2619.04 --> 2623.16
probably I mean there's some really

2620.96 --> 2625.079
weird obscure Mountain Jews now they

2623.16 --> 2626.2
could be called also sapharic or

2625.079 --> 2630.559
whatever

2626.2 --> 2633.5589999999997
it's it it reaches Beyond where I I can

2630.559 --> 2639.0400000000004
properly manage the insides of

2633.559 --> 2639.0400000000004
it there's a a lot of different tribes

2640.359 --> 2644.24
and not all of them are even like

2642.319 --> 2646.52
officially on record anymore it's just

2644.24 --> 2646.52
kind of

2657.24 --> 2661.4799999999996
Forgotten askanazi are

2662.2 --> 2670.3999999999996
European I don't know about that

2667.16 --> 2670.3999999999996

2963.04 --> 2968.72
that think I've seen like clips of that

2965.96 --> 2968.7200000000003
go around

2990.2 --> 2996.52
it was good and true

2992.52 --> 2996.52
okay sure

2997.76 --> 3000.76
h

3043.28 --> 3046.6800000000003
oh God

3059.799 --> 3065.8
oh no racism

3062.44 --> 3065.8
[Music]

3075.119 --> 3078.52
racism auto

3079.28 --> 3083.88
correct you being the vine moody

3085.559 --> 3089.599
people what is that supposed to

3110.559 --> 3114.559
be okay

3117.92 --> 3121.88
right well hope everybody's enjoying

3119.799 --> 3123.559
themselves if you are then don't forget

3121.88 --> 3127.0
to Rogan it up

3123.559 --> 3127.0
and share the

3128.839 --> 3134.319
show is the WIS of practicing Christian

3131.839 --> 3134.319
well so he

3135.24 --> 3140.0
says I mean I don't think he's like a

3137.44 --> 3141.44
churchgoer or anything maybe he even

3140.0 --> 3144.76
does that

3141.44 --> 3149.2400000000002
sometimes but I mean he is

3144.76 --> 3153.599
like he Trust the Bible cosmology

3149.24 --> 3157.64
and and he is like he is effectively a

3153.599 --> 3157.6400000000003
follower of Christ I

3159.76 --> 3164.6800000000003
mean it it seems like a Christian to

3168.4 --> 3174.7200000000003
me just a good guy wanted that wants to

3171.4 --> 3174.7200000000003
do good

3181.92 --> 3185.96
f is common core in Ethiopia

3187.319 --> 3193.2799999999997
cool he's not a

3189.92 --> 3193.28
paon oh is

3194.599 --> 3204.599
it yeah no he doesn't seem like that

3198.599 --> 3204.599
like he's actually open-minded that yeah

3211.119 --> 3214.7200000000003
what's apolon oh

3215.319 --> 3222.7599999999998
dear that's a

3218.24 --> 3222.7599999999998
whole situation there with

3226.92 --> 3234.319
Christianity like apolon is a is a

3230.48 --> 3240.4
Christian who basically trusts Saul

3234.319 --> 3240.4
Paul to be a superseding of

3241.92 --> 3248.119
Christ who doesn't recognize that he

3245.0 --> 3251.839
actually leads away from directly

3248.119 --> 3251.839
hearing Christ's words

3252.04 --> 3258.88
and yeah that's what he does he just

3254.96 --> 3258.88
kind of like turns it into his own

3260.119 --> 3265.52
thing and it it all becomes way more

3262.92 --> 3267.88
satanic because of him because of him

3265.52 --> 3269.7599999999998
like there is this idea like you have to

3267.88 --> 3273.799
believe in this

3269.76 --> 3277.48
chant or you're either with us or you're

3273.799 --> 3280.7599999999998
with the with the devil basically that's

3277.48 --> 3280.76
his invention

3330.359 --> 3337.2
right well Define good good by what

3333.0 --> 3340.559
standard like based on what

3337.2 --> 3342.24
pattern based on Whose pattern like how

3340.559 --> 3346.44
do you define

3342.24 --> 3348.9599999999996
good well I think that everything that

3346.44 --> 3350.839
Jesus at least described in the Bible

3348.96 --> 3352.799
like what he does how he does it the

3350.839 --> 3357.16
things that he says I think that is a

3352.799 --> 3358.52
good definition of good

3357.16 --> 3362.16
the

3358.52 --> 3362.16
objective of doing

3368.559 --> 3374.88
good that's right

3371.839 --> 3378.839
Shaha was a true disciple but he wasn't

3374.88 --> 3378.839
a disciple he never even met

3380.76 --> 3388.039
Jesus and he saw him on the road to

3384.92 --> 3389.76
Damascus so supposedly and said like oh

3388.039 --> 3393.1600000000003
yeah he talk to me and like oh yeah I

3389.76 --> 3395.8390000000004
could just change like I I got I'm the

3393.16 --> 3400.0789999999997
special boy now I can continue where he

3395.839 --> 3402.799
left off and I'll correct him right that

3400.079 --> 3407.6800000000003
notion that you just correct it even

3402.799 --> 3409.92
though Jesus's wisdom was fractal so it

3407.68 --> 3415.44
applies

3409.92 --> 3415.44
always you just have to understand how

3420.48 --> 3427.119
right that's the issue is that

3423.28 --> 3429.3190000000004
Paul didn't set out to like

3427.119 --> 3433.599
clarify and

3429.319 --> 3440.079
refine Jesus's esoteric

3433.599 --> 3443.599
statements he set out to supersede them

3440.079 --> 3447.039
yeah and that is like the

3443.599 --> 3450.6800000000003
egregious influence that that he has and

3447.039 --> 3456.48
like makes it into really not a

3450.68 --> 3456.48
Christian but Aon as Clary says it

3478.119 --> 3482.839
okay think that good has an absolute

3490.52 --> 3497.599
definition but how about in in in

3495.64 --> 3502.2799999999997
practicality

3497.599 --> 3504.839
Burns yeah I mean sure in definition you

3502.28 --> 3507.7200000000003
could put it down

3504.839 --> 3510.68
succinctly but in Practical terms that's

3507.72 --> 3510.68
where the issues come

3511.28 --> 3517.7200000000003
in there's a series out there called

3514.68 --> 3519.9199999999996
Star Trek Voyager that's like really

3517.72 --> 3521.8799999999997
good at like putting that in front of

3519.92 --> 3526.28
your face Star Trek next Generation too

3521.88 --> 3528.2400000000002
by the way maybe even better right

3526.28 --> 3529.28
complications of what's the right thing

3528.24 --> 3533.799
to

3529.28 --> 3533.799
do moral complications

3546.359 --> 3550.4
then again maybe that's different like

3548.76 --> 3554.3190000000004
that maybe that's the difference between

3550.4 --> 3556.1600000000003
doing good and doing the right thing I

3554.319 --> 3557.88
think that doing good is probably on

3556.16 --> 3560.68
average

3557.88 --> 3564.0
easier doing the right thing can be way

3560.68 --> 3564.0
more complicated

3568.88 --> 3574.359
also because doing the right thing has

3571.039 --> 3576.1600000000003
like in a way a managerial function

3574.359 --> 3578.4
while doing the good thing is just a

3576.16 --> 3581.2799999999997
frequency

3578.4 --> 3583.839
focus and doing the right thing is

3581.28 --> 3585.119
potentially also doing something bad so

3583.839 --> 3588.88
that something

3585.119 --> 3590.96
good would come out of it when if you

3588.88 --> 3592.52
didn't do it then definitely not

3590.96 --> 3595.079
something good would come out of it that

3592.52 --> 3597.4
kind of thing so it's more strategical

3595.079 --> 3599.52
more manager

3597.4 --> 3601.92
right doing the right thing more

3599.52 --> 3603.92
managerial doing good it's just

3601.92 --> 3608.079
frequency based it's just

3603.92 --> 3608.079
like it's not always super

3622.039 --> 3625.7200000000003
functional right this is the kind of

3624.24 --> 3628.839
thing that I love by the way like we're

3625.72 --> 3632.359
having a conversation and then suddenly

3628.839 --> 3635.0
the esoterics just they just reveal

3632.359 --> 3637.0
themselves to me it's like yeah good

3635.0 --> 3639.2
yeah that is a specific

3637.0 --> 3641.319
thing but that's not where the

3639.2 --> 3642.9199999999996
complications usually lie that's with

3641.319 --> 3645.4
doing the right

3642.92 --> 3647.799
thing why is that complicated well

3645.4 --> 3650.079
because you're taking

3647.799 --> 3653.0
control when you try to do the right

3650.079 --> 3655.6400000000003
thing and take control you're basically

3653.0 --> 3659.44
taking on like a little G function and

3655.64 --> 3662.799
try to manage the

3659.44 --> 3666.96
situation which is riskier and you have

3662.799 --> 3669.64
to usually you can't just do good you

3666.96 --> 3672.96
have to be more complicated and even

3669.64 --> 3674.68
manipul like it becomes a little G

3672.96 --> 3677.96
effect

3674.68 --> 3677.96
just it's

3681.52 --> 3686.72
fascinating right doing good does not

3684.88 --> 3690.359
mean take control

3686.72 --> 3692.5989999999997
control it's even naturally Associated

3690.359 --> 3692.5989999999997
like

3692.799 --> 3697.64
that people that take control aren't

3695.559 --> 3701.48
typically seen as

3697.64 --> 3704.96
good they have to manage they will end

3701.48 --> 3710.96
up basically tricking people trying to

3704.96 --> 3710.96
enslave them to keep control to manage

3719.559 --> 3723.079
okay clear that kind of

3724.0 --> 3729.68
depends that's not a good thing that's a

3727.039 --> 3733.48
nice thing yeah there's a difference

3729.68 --> 3734.9199999999996
right the right thing a good thing and a

3733.48 --> 3737.2400000000002
nice

3734.92 --> 3739.559
thing they're very

3737.24 --> 3743.16
different that's actually good enough to

3739.559 --> 3743.1600000000003
put in the title

3753.839 --> 3756.839
that

3758.29 --> 3761.369
[Music]

3763.73 --> 3766.7690000000002
[Music]

3780.16 --> 3784.5989999999997
the difference between the right good

3782.319 --> 3784.599
and

3786.16 --> 3789.64
nice I got a

3804.76 --> 3808.76
title for

3844.48 --> 3848.2
no clear

3853.24 --> 3858.2
no like that doesn't have anything to do

3856.68 --> 3862.7599999999998
with it

3858.2 --> 3862.7599999999998
whatsoever a generic movie

3864.72 --> 3868.68
reference for

3901.039 --> 3905.5200000000004
what is an example of something that is

3903.359 --> 3909.44
nice but not

3905.52 --> 3911.88
right well if you tell somebody that is

3909.44 --> 3914.48
not doing great that they're that

3911.88 --> 3914.48
they're just

3921.96 --> 3927.88
fine right being nice is trying to

3924.92 --> 3930.96
basically play into somebody's emotions

3927.88 --> 3935.4
for example to calm them down even

3930.96 --> 3935.4
though their situation technically is

3938.359 --> 3944.279
bad so if you then help them distract

3942.76 --> 3947.88
their psyche

3944.279 --> 3950.44
away from being distressed that also

3947.88 --> 3953.2000000000003
leads them to not deal with the

3950.44 --> 3957.839
situation head

3953.2 --> 3959.799
on well that's a nice nice thing like

3957.839 --> 3963.359
that will be perceived as nice and

3959.799 --> 3966.0389999999998
friendly by the recipient but it will

3963.359 --> 3969.5989999999997
not lead them to actually help

3966.039 --> 3972.6400000000003
themselves right so that's nice but it's

3969.599 --> 3975.039
not necessarily the right thing to

3972.64 --> 3977.72
do it's the right thing to do is

3975.039 --> 3977.7200000000003
actually

3978.52 --> 3985.2
confrontation but confrontation is often

3981.839 --> 3985.2
not nice

4008.16 --> 4013.24
yeah but if you just say your life sucks

4011.119 --> 4017.88
that's not

4013.24 --> 4017.8799999999997
right that's not good and it's not not

4022.68 --> 4028.799
nice it's honest perhaps but it's not

4030.319 --> 4033.839
right like it's

4034.2 --> 4039.7599999999998
neutral and it

4036.2 --> 4042.2
is actually like pointing at the

4039.76 --> 4045.119
negative aspect of

4042.2 --> 4048.839
it your life sucks is basically saying

4045.119 --> 4051.0
like it's all bad like how saying that

4048.839 --> 4054.0789999999997
everything is all

4051.0 --> 4056.359
bad unless you give an option for

4054.079 --> 4059.3590000000004
Redemption is never the right thing to

4056.359 --> 4059.359
say

4082.599 --> 4089.839
the Earth is a globe is nice what

4086.559 --> 4091.76
wrong well it's only nice if you're an

4089.839 --> 4096.039
addict to it but yeah that's a

4091.76 --> 4096.039000000001
interesting example there clearly

4122.319 --> 4125.319
h

4137.92 --> 4141.06
[Music]

4154.0 --> 4159.159
cly oh God please don't

4157.0 --> 4164.08
Clary

4159.159 --> 4164.08
that's way tougher to pronounce

4191.52 --> 4196.320000000001
all right

4193.36 --> 4198.199
Burns thanks for being in the chat and I

4196.32 --> 4202.199
mean it's been interesting having this

4198.199 --> 4205.5199999999995
conversation about Jews all of a

4202.199 --> 4210.599999999999
sudden and then leading to morality what

4205.52 --> 4210.6
is the nature of it like what's the

4210.84 --> 4217.2390000000005
difference between doing the right

4214.8 --> 4221.4400000000005
thing being

4217.239 --> 4221.44
good and being

4222.44 --> 4227.879999999999
nice or playing it nice saying

4237.48 --> 4243.28
it

4239.8 --> 4246.08
what all righty

4243.28 --> 4248.719
then all right anyway don't forget to

4246.08 --> 4252.36
Rogan it up if you haven't

4248.719 --> 4252.36
already share the

4253.12 --> 4259.88
show also another reminder that this

4256.679 --> 4264.92
evening there will be a night owl show

4259.88 --> 4264.92
with flatter Sage looking forward to

4275.52 --> 4279.52
that what

4287.48 --> 4293.12
what instills a person to be good to

4290.12 --> 4293.12
another

4294.96 --> 4300.56
resonance do unto others as you would

4297.44 --> 4300.5599999999995
have them do onto

4303.719 --> 4310.639
you that's like one of the

4306.84 --> 4310.639
primary teachings of

4313.4 --> 4321.638999999999
Jesus right you set the tone you set the

4317.44 --> 4321.638999999999
example you inspire you

4321.8 --> 4326.04
instill that action

4339.35 --> 4342.399
[Music]

4345.32 --> 4350.5599999999995
where did that come

4347.48 --> 4352.678999999999
from yeah well from the father yeah sure

4350.56 --> 4357.360000000001
I mean but it comes from within us

4352.679 --> 4357.36
though like we as people have the

4357.4 --> 4362.679
option to do

4359.679 --> 4367.1990000000005
that because we know that is possible

4362.679 --> 4372.04
that it exists and that arguably

4367.199 --> 4376.04
is from God or at least it is like a

4372.04 --> 4376.04
better way of existing

4376.96 --> 4383.04
it's more spiritual more spiritually

4379.92 --> 4383.04
rewarding and it's less

4392.239 --> 4400.678999999999
Earthly also being good like

4397.08 --> 4405.239
effectively staves off

4400.679 --> 4405.2390000000005
entropy it's more durable

4422.98 --> 4426.139999999999
[Music]

4426.36 --> 4433.5599999999995
because he put it in US yeah no that I

4431.0 --> 4436.0
agree I mean we

4433.56 --> 4439.6
do have

4436.0 --> 4442.44
like arguably what we are like our

4439.6 --> 4444.639
Consciousness is in my view probably

4442.44 --> 4444.638999999999
like

4445.0 --> 4454.12
a a simulacrum a small part very small

4449.6 --> 4454.120000000001
part of the Creator like aspects of

4456.12 --> 4464.04
it and thereby we have that option like

4460.36 --> 4467.44
we share that akashic

4464.04 --> 4467.44
Library of the

4472.199 --> 4479.159
Creator in that sense like we can be

4475.48 --> 4479.159
like the Creator through our

4479.719 --> 4486.08
actions have a similar resonance have a

4482.84 --> 4491.679
similar Direction and like Jesus is like

4486.08 --> 4491.679
the primary example of of that

4496.44 --> 4502.799999999999
and so from that perspective like you

4498.719 --> 4505.84
will never be God entirely but you can

4502.8 --> 4508.639
just be closer and closer and

4505.84 --> 4510.4400000000005
closer and will be recognized as such

4508.639 --> 4512.4400000000005
but nobody's going to then like

4510.44 --> 4515.08
eventually like take the throne or

4512.44 --> 4519.12
anything that that doesn't

4515.08 --> 4523.88
happen but you can't just like get ever

4519.12 --> 4525.599999999999
closer to that narrowest of narrowest

4523.88 --> 4528.92
yeah is that a word narrow

4525.6 --> 4528.92
W of

4538.239 --> 4546.48
paths and Jesus was all about teaching

4542.239 --> 4546.48
that and understanding those

4547.76 --> 4553.719
things like he had the right idea he had

4550.4 --> 4557.5599999999995
the right balance and like

4553.719 --> 4558.719
anybody can recognize that if you're

4557.56 --> 4561.719
like

4558.719 --> 4561.719
genuinely

4562.04 --> 4567.679
open-minded and you don't like view his

4565.28 --> 4568.44
teachings with any kind of prejudgment

4567.679 --> 4571.6
or

4568.44 --> 4575.0
whatever just look at it as how it is

4571.6 --> 4575.0
and then you you will

4576.88 --> 4584.84
notice what

4580.159 --> 4584.839999999999
it what are you talking about

4596.52 --> 4600.080000000001
okay hey gaining

4606.88 --> 4612.56
wisdom Deuteronomy tells us it's written

4610.159 --> 4612.5599999999995
in our

4612.8 --> 4617.400000000001
hearts yeah that's an interesting way of

4615.08 --> 4617.4
saying

4618.44 --> 4624.799999999999
it right so yeah what's written in our

4621.8 --> 4627.400000000001
hearts is like the interface with the

4624.8 --> 4627.400000000001
akashik

4637.76 --> 4645.04
record like so that we have a feeling

4640.92 --> 4647.84
sensory like a compass as to what is

4645.04 --> 4647.84
what and what it

4655.4 --> 4660.599999999999
means and everybody like tends to have

4658.679 --> 4664.32
their own focus on what they're going to

4660.6 --> 4667.88
choose to emphasize within whatever

4664.32 --> 4672.04
available subconscious heart-based

4667.88 --> 4675.8
information arrives from

4672.04 --> 4680.0
something but

4675.8 --> 4683.56
if those specificities would be like

4680.0 --> 4686.92
broken down then like everybody could be

4683.56 --> 4689.04
made to agree that everybody has a point

4686.92 --> 4692.719
and that it is all like that

4689.04 --> 4696.199
because our hearts the compass like can

4692.719 --> 4698.92
just tell like how it is and it works

4696.199 --> 4698.919999999999
the same with

4700.84 --> 4705.88
everybody unless your compass is broken

4703.52 --> 4707.360000000001
and then you get no sense CES whatsoever

4705.88 --> 4710.52
but that's like

4707.36 --> 4714.839999999999
a that is very

4710.52 --> 4714.84
alienating somebody that doesn't have

4720.0 --> 4725.12
that so yeah internal Compass like

4723.04 --> 4727.159
that's that's what that refers to what

4725.12 --> 4730.239
is written in our

4727.159 --> 4733.08
hearts and it is a sensory thing it's

4730.239 --> 4735.4
not a cognitive thing it's just by

4733.08 --> 4738.32
feeling it's like the whole the compass

4735.4 --> 4742.36
to whatever is there you can just feel

4738.32 --> 4745.639
it out from the akashik record just like

4742.36 --> 4748.08
that's what that

4745.639 --> 4751.6
is it's on that

4748.08 --> 4751.6
level in that

4756.12 --> 4761.04
direction and like two separate people

4759.159 --> 4762.92
could be judging the same thing

4761.04 --> 4764.96
completely separate from each other not

4762.92 --> 4766.159
even being aware of each other that that

4764.96 --> 4770.159
they

4766.159 --> 4772.92
exist and just roughly follow the exact

4770.159 --> 4772.92
same set of

4773.04 --> 4779.0
conclusions and even the way they will

4775.56 --> 4782.84
Express themselves as they are

4779.0 --> 4782.84
expressing their judgment will be

4785.239 --> 4790.718999999999
similar because it it really is

4787.719 --> 4790.719
universal

4806.52 --> 4813.639
right in what you know to be what is

4809.639 --> 4815.32
universal but your opinion is like what

4813.639 --> 4819.32
your Consciousness

4815.32 --> 4822.44
does with the information what it seeks

4819.32 --> 4824.759999999999
out but that's like a process on top of

4822.44 --> 4826.839999999999
the base information

4824.76 --> 4828.08
and the base information is like the

4826.84 --> 4832.92
akashic

4828.08 --> 4832.92
record and everybody just feels

4833.239 --> 4839.159
that it's almost like a magnetic field

4836.76 --> 4842.639
and yeah our hearts are the compass and

4839.159 --> 4844.5599999999995
you just can't tell it's like yeah there

4842.639 --> 4846.76
it's pointing that

4844.56 --> 4848.120000000001
direction and everybody there is just

4846.76 --> 4851.12
like yeah it's all pointing that

4848.12 --> 4851.12
direction

4857.679 --> 4861.4400000000005
hey seeking star water good to see you

4865.12 --> 4871.96
again the god of no

4867.96 --> 4871.96
words what

4889.4 --> 4895.4
what Shana H like what there's some I

4893.28 --> 4898.759999999999
don't understand that sentence about

4895.4 --> 4902.239
Wicked people doesn't seem like that's

4898.76 --> 4902.2390000000005
spelled correctly

4921.28 --> 4926.159
right but I mean yeah the moral compass

4923.48 --> 4928.879999999999
thing what is written on our hearts it

4926.159 --> 4930.5599999999995
is because of its

4928.88 --> 4933.08
Universal

4930.56 --> 4935.88
Factor there really it does really

4933.08 --> 4938.96
present like

4935.88 --> 4943.679
where the choice comes

4938.96 --> 4946.36
in the Free Will aspect to choose with

4943.679 --> 4948.28
or against it

4946.36 --> 4952.159
that is

4948.28 --> 4952.159
within the compass of the

4959.4 --> 4963.4
heart okay

4979.89 --> 4982.979
[Music]

5003.32 --> 5006.719
hey LSG bits see

5033.44 --> 5039.719
you you hate

5035.52 --> 5039.719
typing okay Shana

5048.91 --> 5052.05
[Music]

5065.04 --> 5070.48
right anyway the akashic record it's

5068.199 --> 5073.879999999999
fascinating when you really think about

5070.48 --> 5076.199
it like it's not just cognitive

5073.88 --> 5078.0
information and like mechanical

5076.199 --> 5084.638999999999
information

5078.0 --> 5084.639
and intellectual structures it's also

5086.0 --> 5094.52
feelings it's like another layer to it

5089.679 --> 5094.52
the kosic record is basically a

5096.119 --> 5105.28
a set of layered different types of

5100.88 --> 5105.28
information that are all like

5106.88 --> 5112.1990000000005
fractal it's

5109.48 --> 5114.5199999999995
yeah and people sometimes forget that

5112.199 --> 5117.599999999999
it's like yeah the compass of the heart

5114.52 --> 5120.52
you can feel out something about what

5117.6 --> 5122.88
how it is it's like you're what gives

5120.52 --> 5125.0
you orientation and then after you've

5122.88 --> 5128.96
had orientation then you're intellect

5125.0 --> 5131.92
based on the reliability of the

5128.96 --> 5134.6
orientation can basically start to

5131.92 --> 5139.4800000000005
figure out what is

5134.6 --> 5142.08
what based on the base parameters on the

5139.48 --> 5142.08
compass of the

5142.8 --> 5149.28
heart as a foundation as a vantage point

5146.92 --> 5152.28
of structuring the information that is

5149.28 --> 5152.28
presented

5155.56 --> 5160.280000000001
that's also by the way why if you're

5157.88 --> 5162.679
like emotionally

5160.28 --> 5165.32
confused like you don't know how to

5162.679 --> 5165.32
interpret

5170.28 --> 5176.32
things right because pure

5173.56 --> 5178.84
intellectualism doesn't provide any

5176.32 --> 5178.84
moral

5180.119 --> 5185.119
guidance except what you presuppose

5195.679 --> 5201.2390000000005
well if you have a normal interface with

5199.28 --> 5204.4
your compass of the heart to know what

5201.239 --> 5207.919999999999
is what then that

5204.4 --> 5210.239
is a really reliable Foundation that

5207.92 --> 5211.52
even when intellectual activity stops

5210.239 --> 5214.199
you still

5211.52 --> 5216.84
know like everything comes to rest and

5214.199 --> 5218.44
and it is still that reliable same

5216.84 --> 5222.360000000001
Foundation like the meaning doesn't

5218.44 --> 5222.36
change because it's comes from the

5237.239 --> 5242.08
heart oh God clear

5270.04 --> 5273.679
right and the funny thing is like with

5271.96 --> 5275.92
this type of insight of what I'm

5273.679 --> 5278.8
providing the aachc record and like how

5275.92 --> 5283.1990000000005
to regard it like that you can even

5278.8 --> 5283.1990000000005
reflect that back onto the chakra

5284.719 --> 5291.4800000000005
system yeah the heart being here at the

5288.199 --> 5294.678999999999
center and the intellect being

5291.48 --> 5297.28
here right so the heart is like the

5294.679 --> 5298.28
foundation your under chakras are like

5297.28 --> 5301.639
the

5298.28 --> 5305.599999999999
roots and this is where it grows but if

5301.639 --> 5308.0
the foundation is wrong it it like it

5305.6 --> 5310.8
can't

5308.0 --> 5314.239
grow and that's why when your heart is

5310.8 --> 5318.119000000001
disrupted like a broken heart

5314.239 --> 5322.199
or a heavy loss or whatever like is so

5318.119 --> 5324.32
distorting and it just makes the rest

5322.199 --> 5330.0
not

5324.32 --> 5333.159
function because you can't use that

5330.0 --> 5336.0
Foundation like you need a foundation

5333.159 --> 5338.759999999999
from the heart to properly build an

5336.0 --> 5342.52
intellectual

5338.76 --> 5345.84
structure that yeah has to have that

5342.52 --> 5348.0
basis Vantage Point feeling trust and

5345.84 --> 5349.679
insight into like knowing what is what

5348.0 --> 5352.719
and how is

5349.679 --> 5354.639
how to build a proper temporary

5352.719 --> 5357.28
intellectual

5354.639 --> 5359.159000000001
structure that will stand the test of

5357.28 --> 5362.159
time because it's based on a solid

5359.159 --> 5362.159
foundation

5368.159 --> 5373.719
a foundation within the

5370.159 --> 5378.4
heart that's that's the ground the heart

5373.719 --> 5378.4
is like where the sky meets the

5380.6 --> 5386.119000000001
ground it's the Horizon of the spirit

5410.08 --> 5413.08
h

5421.93 --> 5425.02
[Music]

5442.56 --> 5446.4400000000005
there's a lot of these

5452.49 --> 5455.66
[Applause]

5479.8 --> 5482.8
h

5487.92 --> 5490.4800000000005
I like

5491.52 --> 5498.119000000001
that I feel a fractal implication there

5495.0 --> 5500.159
a wider context heart is the Horizon of

5498.119 --> 5503.44
the

5500.159 --> 5506.119
spirit like that feels like an esoteric

5503.44 --> 5506.119
statement

5506.48 --> 5512.199
beyond my current

5509.28 --> 5514.759999999999
understanding feels like I discovered

5512.199 --> 5516.919999999999
something by saying that interesting how

5514.76 --> 5516.92
that

5524.28 --> 5529.5199999999995
works did everybody see Terrence Howard

5527.56 --> 5534.320000000001
on the

5529.52 --> 5534.320000000001
no what was it about LSG

5571.76 --> 5579.2390000000005
astrophysicist yeah

5575.08 --> 5579.239
or as I like to call them asth throat

5579.92 --> 5585.84
physicist because they talk a lot of

5582.239 --> 5585.839999999999
[ __ ] to mouth

5611.52 --> 5617.719
how to make your message above

5614.719 --> 5617.719
scene

5627.4 --> 5634.28
what teren Howard broke the

5631.88 --> 5639.400000000001
what how did he do that

5634.28 --> 5639.4
I mean they like to exaggerate a lot at

5643.57 --> 5646.66
[Music]

5651.96 --> 5657.6
Rogan oh God that

5654.6 --> 5657.6
guy

5657.639 --> 5665.639
G what a bunch of hor [ __ ] I can't

5661.84 --> 5669.04
believe that Rogan actually f for that

5665.639 --> 5673.04
crap it's the most pathetic

5669.04 --> 5675.88
mathematically incompetent gaslighting

5673.04 --> 5678.32
operation of the 21st

5675.88 --> 5682.119
century that

5678.32 --> 5686.4
guy yeah I remember

5682.119 --> 5689.799999999999
now I mean he's like he's expanding Upon

5686.4 --> 5691.839999999999
A systematic category

5689.8 --> 5695.28
error

5691.84 --> 5697.56
yeah he's basically

5695.28 --> 5701.5199999999995
reifying like

5697.56 --> 5706.280000000001
physical properties and then like saying

5701.52 --> 5709.92
like oh the math isn't

5706.28 --> 5711.48
real because physically you can't

5709.92 --> 5715.28
have

5711.48 --> 5718.08
multiplication like it doesn't like it's

5715.28 --> 5721.84
it's absolutely ridiculous it's

5718.08 --> 5726.28
basically saying like math is wrong

5721.84 --> 5728.719
because you can't phys Al do

5726.28 --> 5730.599999999999
it so you have to do the math

5728.719 --> 5733.44
differently then well that makes

5730.6 --> 5733.4400000000005
absolutely no

5733.76 --> 5740.76
sense what it basically does is

5738.119 --> 5744.599999999999
like

5740.76 --> 5747.88
reify an issue that like math Believers

5744.6 --> 5751.76
have that they think math is reality but

5747.88 --> 5754.28
then it proceeds to try to force it

5751.76 --> 5756.76
through

5754.28 --> 5759.0
to try to make math into reality and it

5756.76 --> 5761.6
doesn't work instead of just saying like

5759.0 --> 5763.239
uh yeah math is math it's conceptual it

5761.6 --> 5766.639
isn't

5763.239 --> 5769.44
real and physical things are physical

5766.639 --> 5773.4400000000005
and it's what it is and you

5769.44 --> 5777.48
can do things with the physical that are

5773.44 --> 5777.48
math-based and that will

5777.6 --> 5782.84
work right but when for example when you

5780.28 --> 5785.36
have a multiplication system this is

5782.84 --> 5786.96
like iMed immediately address his

5785.36 --> 5789.199
absolute

5786.96 --> 5791.159
Foundation that just grows into this

5789.199 --> 5794.159
cluster screw of

5791.159 --> 5796.4
nonsense when you have a

5794.159 --> 5800.4
multiplication you have one part that's

5796.4 --> 5800.4
real and one part that is a

5802.44 --> 5809.239
conceptual right you don't

5806.04 --> 5811.88
multiply physical times physical because

5809.239 --> 5815.28
then you'd have physical

5811.88 --> 5817.639
squared but you can have have a

5815.28 --> 5821.96
number not being

5817.639 --> 5824.2390000000005
physical and a number of

5821.96 --> 5826.32
things and then you

5824.239 --> 5830.159
multiply the

5826.32 --> 5833.119
number not by the physical nature of it

5830.159 --> 5836.199
but by the number of the physical nature

5833.119 --> 5839.32
based things and then you can multiply

5836.199 --> 5841.678999999999
the things without them becoming things

5839.32 --> 5845.5199999999995
squared right and this is where it just

5841.679 --> 5845.52
like completely [ __ ] it off

5847.84 --> 5853.6
up I mean I can address pretty much

5851.36 --> 5856.92
everything that he talks about and like

5853.6 --> 5858.96
perfectly Rectify it and get the

5856.92 --> 5861.08
misunderstanding out of the way it is

5858.96 --> 5864.56
absolutely

5861.08 --> 5868.32
pathetic if Rogan actually fell for

5864.56 --> 5871.76
that he's even smaller than I

5868.32 --> 5874.0
thought I mean like I think that maybe

5871.76 --> 5875.76
even calling him a thumb is like too

5874.0 --> 5877.199
good for him or something we should just

5875.76 --> 5879.599
call him

5877.199 --> 5881.799999999999
pinky maybe I'm going to call Rogan

5879.599 --> 5883.400000000001
Pinky from now on if he actually buys

5881.8 --> 5886.360000000001
into Terrence

5883.4 --> 5889.96
Phillip Terren

5886.36 --> 5889.96
Howard Terren and

5890.199 --> 5894.48
Phillip that's Canadian

5908.84 --> 5912.96
pinky up the show that's

5916.04 --> 5922.08
hilarious but I mean seriously if he

5918.88 --> 5923.719
actually if Rogan actually said like oh

5922.08 --> 5927.32
I never thought of it like that you

5923.719 --> 5930.32
might have a point then it's like oh

5927.32 --> 5930.32
Rogan

5932.199 --> 5937.719
oh I mean I mean nobody can truly blame

5935.159 --> 5939.119
you for your small stature but for your

5937.719 --> 5942.119
small

5939.119 --> 5942.119
mind

5943.4 --> 5951.759999999999
yeah I mean I'm not a a math Enthusiast

5947.639 --> 5954.92
here but I know what math

5951.76 --> 5958.04
is what actually happens I know the

5954.92 --> 5960.56
substrata I know the substructure of

5958.04 --> 5961.56
what it is when you do math what happens

5960.56 --> 5964.719
in the

5961.56 --> 5969.320000000001
mind what is actually taking place and I

5964.719 --> 5972.719
know how what he talks about rests upon

5969.32 --> 5974.96
you not seeing what actually happens in

5972.719 --> 5974.96
the

5975.159 --> 5979.799999999999
substrata of

5977.199 --> 5982.96
math what it actually is that you do

5979.8 --> 5986.400000000001
when you perform math and apply it to

5982.96 --> 5991.639
Something in physical reality for

5986.4 --> 5995.32
example we have substructure sub strata

5991.639 --> 5995.32
sub designation

5996.239 --> 6001.28
factors that are normally unnamed

5999.0 --> 6004.8
because it's just kind of assumed like

6001.28 --> 6007.88
you just get that it's it is Superfluous

6004.8 --> 6010.4800000000005
it's like when you mention people you

6007.88 --> 6012.400000000001
have to like give out the entire address

6010.48 --> 6016.08
information every single time you name

6012.4 --> 6019.08
them right that's annoying Superfluous

6016.08 --> 6022.0
it distracts so you don't do that even

6019.08 --> 6025.32
though that information is all

6022.0 --> 6025.32
there right

6031.119 --> 6035.679
it's just like yeah you know the name

6033.28 --> 6037.759999999999
well that name implies all those other

6035.679 --> 6041.4
things as

6037.76 --> 6043.76
well that's directly Associated you know

6041.4 --> 6048.5199999999995
where it comes from you just like of

6043.76 --> 6051.52
course that person has an address

6048.52 --> 6055.4800000000005
Etc right it's a

6051.52 --> 6057.639
person well with math there are these

6055.48 --> 6060.919999999999
factors this

6057.639 --> 6063.52
logic like hey you have an amount of

6060.92 --> 6065.88
something the amount is a

6063.52 --> 6067.96
mathematical

6065.88 --> 6069.679
designation but you still have the

6067.96 --> 6072.199
something well the

6069.679 --> 6074.4800000000005
something is not a mathematical

6072.199 --> 6077.32
designation it is a

6074.48 --> 6079.759999999999
nature that nature is not going to be

6077.32 --> 6083.759999999999
multiplied when you

6079.76 --> 6087.08
multiply it so for example if you have

6083.76 --> 6089.1990000000005
five oranges you could multiply them by

6087.08 --> 6092.119
five and then you'll have 25 oranges but

6089.199 --> 6096.199
you can't multiply them by five oranges

6092.119 --> 6099.199
and then get 25 Orange

6096.199 --> 6099.199
squared

6102.08 --> 6106.44
see this already sounds ridiculous when

6104.639 --> 6110.32
I say it like that but you know that

6106.44 --> 6113.08
this is like logical consequence

6110.32 --> 6116.4
of of these rudimentary things and this

6113.08 --> 6119.719
is is where that guy that Terrence

6116.4 --> 6122.239
Howard goes straight off the track right

6119.719 --> 6126.08
into the weeds and just let's like yeah

6122.239 --> 6127.718999999999
let's let's wait through this beay area

6126.08 --> 6130.719
let's let's go through this swamp and he

6127.719 --> 6130.719
pulls everybody with

6136.92 --> 6144.04
him you remembered being in the womb

6139.679 --> 6147.08
yeah well in a way so do I LG sort

6144.04 --> 6149.4
of I mean

6147.08 --> 6151.36
that it's not really all that

6149.4 --> 6153.92
consequential it doesn't add to

6151.36 --> 6153.92
anybody's

6155.28 --> 6161.4
Brilliance I mean the guy is like

6158.48 --> 6164.638999999999
obviously in a way a

6161.4 --> 6166.839999999999
wizard that's leading people

6164.639 --> 6168.719
astray if he's going to designate

6166.84 --> 6172.08
himself with Brilliance then he should

6168.719 --> 6174.84
be able to distinguish between like

6172.08 --> 6177.76
rudimentary reality and the difference

6174.84 --> 6180.84
between math and he's not doing

6177.76 --> 6183.84
that so he has to be like an yeah like

6180.84 --> 6183.84
an actor a

6183.88 --> 6189.599
wizard a bad one an Illusionist somebody

6187.4 --> 6191.598999999999
that leads you astray not not a good

6189.599 --> 6193.1990000000005
wizard not a Divine or somebody who

6191.599 --> 6196.360000000001
finds a way

6193.199 --> 6199.32
through yeah that's the whole difference

6196.36 --> 6202.119
a wizard an Illusionist creates a

6199.32 --> 6206.5599999999995
barrier

6202.119 --> 6210.119
AER finds a way through the

6206.56 --> 6212.96
barrier breaks the illusion but that's

6210.119 --> 6216.44
also Wizardry it's also

6212.96 --> 6216.44
wisdom based

6218.48 --> 6227.718999999999
actions right it's just like within

6221.76 --> 6227.719
necromancy it's like oh you poison

6229.4 --> 6236.36
death doing things with the flesh but I

6232.719 --> 6239.719
mean it's technically also healing like

6236.36 --> 6241.92
even in in game logic and Dungeons and

6239.719 --> 6245.44
Dragons like that's what that is it's

6241.92 --> 6248.639
both sides same goes for Wizardry like

6245.44 --> 6251.48
Wizardry is

6248.639 --> 6253.76
divining knowing figuring things out

6251.48 --> 6255.839999999999
finding a way

6253.76 --> 6258.280000000001
through creating

6255.84 --> 6261.08
Clarity and Wizardry can also be

6258.28 --> 6264.48
creating an illusion that actually

6261.08 --> 6265.32
distracts you away from find way through

6264.48 --> 6268.5199999999995
and

6265.32 --> 6268.5199999999995
Clarity an

6276.239 --> 6281.759999999999
illusion right so every time I say like

6279.04 --> 6284.84
I'm a wizard I'm an elf

6281.76 --> 6287.0
wizard everybody's oh look he's a wizard

6284.84 --> 6290.400000000001
oh it's so crazy to say that well that's

6287.0 --> 6293.76
because everybody Associates a wizard

6290.4 --> 6293.759999999999
with an Illusionist

6294.119 --> 6301.598999999999
somebody who just

6297.119 --> 6301.598999999999
creates nonsense to distract you

6302.679 --> 6309.0
away but like that's not what I think

6306.0 --> 6312.96
Wizardry is exclusively because real

6309.0 --> 6316.0
wizard is also like gandal somebody who

6312.96 --> 6319.679
effectively to other characters creates

6316.0 --> 6324.96
incredible meaningful clarity as

6319.679 --> 6324.96
well and even inserts a bit of purpose

6326.56 --> 6332.92
right well that's also

6330.4 --> 6336.159
Wizardry it's the other side of it it's

6332.92 --> 6338.119
the opposite side of The Illusionist

6336.159 --> 6340.32
it's the

6338.119 --> 6342.32
divver and it's kind of funny because

6340.32 --> 6346.84
even in dungeon dragons like those are

6342.32 --> 6349.32
recognized opposite spell

6346.84 --> 6351.159000000001
schools that's what they call schools of

6349.32 --> 6353.08
magic like different type you have

6351.159 --> 6355.28
transmutation school they have

6353.08 --> 6357.159
enchanting school you have the divining

6355.28 --> 6359.199
school you have

6357.159 --> 6361.839999999999
the

6359.199 --> 6365.5599999999995
abjuration

6361.84 --> 6368.119000000001
evocation illusion and illusion and

6365.56 --> 6370.719
divination are counter opposites like

6368.119 --> 6371.679
they're naturally in opposition to one

6370.719 --> 6373.8
another if you're going to be a

6371.679 --> 6375.32
specialist wizard then you have to

6373.8 --> 6377.119000000001
choose your specialist school if you're

6375.32 --> 6379.32
going to be a divver then you're not

6377.119 --> 6381.239
going to also you're going to not be

6379.32 --> 6382.96
able to cast illusion spells and if

6381.239 --> 6386.959999999999
you're an Illusionist then you're not

6382.96 --> 6389.08
not going to be able to cast divination

6386.96 --> 6393.52
spells because they're opposite if

6389.08 --> 6393.5199999999995
you're a general wizard you can do

6395.52 --> 6399.52
both right

6420.28 --> 6426.8
so how I typically see it is that

6423.679 --> 6429.32
there's like cognitive and

6426.8 --> 6432.1990000000005
intellectual aberration out there things

6429.32 --> 6434.599
that have been constructed or that are

6432.199 --> 6436.678999999999
suggestive that people stumble upon and

6434.599 --> 6440.88
then get fascinated by but

6436.679 --> 6443.04
it's it's elusive like you can't really

6440.88 --> 6445.56
get a grip on it you can't actually

6443.04 --> 6447.32
prove it and then build a foundation on

6445.56 --> 6450.1990000000005
it and those are

6447.32 --> 6454.08
aberration

6450.199 --> 6456.36
and any Illusionist is going to favor

6454.08 --> 6458.92
seeking out aberration and then

6456.36 --> 6463.04
directing people towards them because it

6458.92 --> 6465.88
is a dead end and thus serves as a like

6463.04 --> 6469.08
a living illusion within the akashik

6465.88 --> 6471.88
record that will just keep you occupied

6469.08 --> 6474.36
and thus prevents you from proceeding

6471.88 --> 6477.4800000000005
Beyond

6474.36 --> 6478.799999999999
because it's like an unsolvable puzzle

6477.48 --> 6480.598999999999
that you bump

6478.8 --> 6483.76
into

6480.599 --> 6486.32
illusionists direct people towards

6483.76 --> 6489.360000000001
aberration aberration like gravity

6486.32 --> 6489.36
aberration like The

6489.56 --> 6494.88
Ether right and it doesn't mean there's

6491.96 --> 6498.84
nothing to it it just means that the way

6494.88 --> 6502.0
that it's coalescing that it is getting

6498.84 --> 6503.679
constructed by people it is an an

6502.0 --> 6507.04
aberration it

6503.679 --> 6507.04
you can never really prove

6510.639 --> 6518.04
it and Ken wheeler in that s sense is

6515.119 --> 6521.719
absolutely an Illusionist

6518.04 --> 6526.08
wizard like he is that type of

6521.719 --> 6526.08
figure that creates

6527.159 --> 6533.5599999999995
illusions that sends people to chase

6530.56 --> 6533.56
aberration

6536.32 --> 6541.04
doesn't mean that he did not discover

6538.44 --> 6543.32
like very good interesting things like

6541.04 --> 6546.04
The Duality between electricity and

6543.32 --> 6547.639
magnetism I mean that is quite the

6546.04 --> 6550.56
essential

6547.639 --> 6553.679
Discovery or

6550.56 --> 6555.84
realization that is truthful that is

6553.679 --> 6558.159
very useful for understanding

6555.84 --> 6559.84
engineering concerning electricity and

6558.159 --> 6564.719
magnetism I

6559.84 --> 6564.719
mean very important insight

6566.36 --> 6572.96
right but then he just turns that

6569.92 --> 6575.599
insight into like a compartmentalized

6572.96 --> 6579.199
bead of knowledge and they just puts it

6575.599 --> 6581.96
into the wheelie into the wheelie of the

6579.199 --> 6585.04
supposed what is

6581.96 --> 6588.28
ether when it's just a separated piece

6585.04 --> 6588.28
of knowledge

6611.28 --> 6617.159
right every time somebody's like oh

6613.44 --> 6620.36
you're always dissing on The Ether

6617.159 --> 6623.638999999999
well all the information that is

6620.36 --> 6626.159
contained within the wheelie

6623.639 --> 6628.96
that people associate with ether all

6626.159 --> 6632.96
those things are very interesting and

6628.96 --> 6637.8
they are meaningful up to a certain

6632.96 --> 6641.84
degree but that doesn't make it

6637.8 --> 6646.04
E ether has in that sense by accepting

6641.84 --> 6649.599
the wheie as ether become a platora a

6646.04 --> 6653.719
collection of different things that

6649.599 --> 6653.719
really aren't Unified

6657.56 --> 6664.400000000001
it's ether has become a a name for a

6661.96 --> 6667.52
collection

6664.4 --> 6670.079
of both natural and man-made

6667.52 --> 6670.079000000001
device-based

6671.0 --> 6676.84
phenomena it is is not unified but those

6674.679 --> 6679.599
things are very interesting and those

6676.84 --> 6681.639
things will draw people's attention cuz

6679.599 --> 6684.400000000001
it's like wow this is amazing knowledge

6681.639 --> 6687.400000000001
I want to know more I want to know why

6684.4 --> 6689.839999999999
oh then it ether and people like oh it's

6687.4 --> 6692.32
ether really but they don't understand

6689.84 --> 6692.32
it

6697.719 --> 6707.4
though like you can't prove it so it

6702.079 --> 6710.84
remains a plora of separated

6707.4 --> 6713.44
phenomena that have some structural

6710.84 --> 6717.079
correlation

6713.44 --> 6717.079
but there's it's anything but

6720.76 --> 6725.56
unified ether used to be in the periodic

6725.679 --> 6735.32
no no no it was not boy but ether with

6730.599 --> 6737.56
an E with without the a is like it is a

6735.32 --> 6737.5599999999995
a

6738.159 --> 6745.199
material they used to like use it as

6740.56 --> 6745.1990000000005
anesthetic for people knock him out

6768.079 --> 6772.599
quickly all right anyway I hope

6769.96 --> 6775.04
everybody's having an interesting time

6772.599 --> 6778.4800000000005
like it's been very interesting to me I

6775.04 --> 6778.48
like this good esoteric

6782.92 --> 6787.8
stuff I am however going to take a

6785.079 --> 6791.5599999999995
two-minute break be making a new coffee

6787.8 --> 6791.56
too so be right

6801.44 --> 6804.44
back

6831.44 --> 6834.44
e

6861.36 --> 6864.36
for

6891.32 --> 6894.32
for

6921.32 --> 6924.32
e

6951.239 --> 6954.239
e

6981.239 --> 6984.239
for

7011.239 --> 7014.239
e

7041.159 --> 7045.159
for e

7075.52 --> 7081.079000000001
and I'm

7076.84 --> 7081.079
back hey clutch good to see

7081.599 --> 7088.360000000001
you fiber

7084.679 --> 7088.36
outs good to see you

7091.239 --> 7100.159
all ether is a field no now it's claimed

7095.96 --> 7100.159
to be a field boy

7102.76 --> 7107.4400000000005
it

7104.0 --> 7107.44
isn't there's no

7125.079 --> 7133.44
field how do you describe it

7129.639 --> 7139.079
then ether is an aberration a very

7133.44 --> 7139.079
suggestive idea based on a plora

7139.8 --> 7146.360000000001
of effects and naturally and man-made

7143.8 --> 7146.360000000001
device-based

7146.719 --> 7154.599
phenomena that are yeah that seem to

7151.84 --> 7157.719
somewhat correlate into the suggestion

7154.599 --> 7162.1990000000005
of a backdrop type of field thing but

7157.719 --> 7162.199
there's no actual evidence for that

7174.239 --> 7178.919999999999
right but if you do start to assume that

7176.92 --> 7181.56
the ether is a field and that you're

7178.92 --> 7185.119
just going to presuppose it well then

7181.56 --> 7188.04
you'll end up attributing everything to

7185.119 --> 7191.48
it to the point where people say that

7188.04 --> 7194.199
the ether is God I mean that's what

7191.48 --> 7197.04
happens when you presuppose

7194.199 --> 7199.5199999999995
it once you take that step then you can

7197.04 --> 7202.92
just start attributing everything that's

7199.52 --> 7205.84
Out Of Reach or what could be to The

7202.92 --> 7206.77
Ether and that's what etherians do and

7205.84 --> 7209.909000000001
that's the

7206.77 --> 7209.909000000001
[Music]

7212.48 --> 7217.598999999999
problem ah you got some sun shining

7214.88 --> 7217.599
there clutch

7217.76 --> 7223.88
nice I refuse to acknowledge existence

7221.119 --> 7227.639
that can't be proven

7223.88 --> 7231.1990000000005
M I'm sorry Moxy I'm very sorry that you

7227.639 --> 7231.1990000000005
feel like that

7268.239 --> 7273.4
yeah I mean it basically becomes this

7271.44 --> 7275.079
thing where the ether is just the

7273.4 --> 7277.5199999999995
potential of

7275.079 --> 7281.159
everything why would you attribute that

7277.52 --> 7281.159000000001
to some field

7284.76 --> 7292.4400000000005
why why would you anthropomorphize it

7289.719 --> 7295.079
to to the level where it's not even a

7292.44 --> 7298.0
person anymore but it's just a

7295.079 --> 7299.639
thing a thing a phenomenon a thing

7298.0 --> 7303.159
that's happening

7299.639 --> 7306.32
supposedly an elusive phenomenon

7303.159 --> 7310.28
right I mean

7306.32 --> 7313.239
attributing a personhood to God is

7310.28 --> 7316.759999999999
already one step

7313.239 --> 7320.079
that's it might feel technically

7316.76 --> 7322.8
illogical but to then take it even

7320.079 --> 7327.079
further and just degrade it down to

7322.8 --> 7330.320000000001
where it becomes just a thing that's

7327.079 --> 7333.639
happening taking even Consciousness as a

7330.32 --> 7335.4
factor out of the loop of of creation

7333.639 --> 7340.639
and God I

7335.4 --> 7340.638999999999
mean that's like spiritual atheism

7362.76 --> 7366.119000000001
and I'm going to go the other way and

7364.32 --> 7368.0
saying like yeah oh there's all this

7366.119 --> 7370.679
incredible potential and all these

7368.0 --> 7374.88
things that are beyond our conscious

7370.679 --> 7374.88
sight cuz because we can't handle the

7375.36 --> 7380.28
truth and that is all in the hands of

7378.239 --> 7381.4
God and it's all set in the arashic

7380.28 --> 7384.88
record

7381.4 --> 7387.239
and but even saying like the hands of

7384.88 --> 7389.679
God like all of that is already like a

7387.239 --> 7393.0
personification

7389.679 --> 7395.32
anthropomorphization of a thing that is

7393.0 --> 7395.32
so

7400.0 --> 7403.76
all-encompassing like it defin

7406.04 --> 7412.4
description I'm not going to degrade all

7408.52 --> 7412.400000000001
of that down to like a

7413.159 --> 7418.44
phenomenon I'm going to leave it up

7415.44 --> 7418.44
there

7449.559 --> 7452.559
h

7482.44 --> 7485.44
now

7498.92 --> 7504.88
Mo

7501.559 --> 7504.88
what where's

7504.92 --> 7509.159
Mojo is Mojo here in the

7509.559 --> 7514.1990000000005
chat I didn't see him

7534.28 --> 7539.0
and moo is such a funny word

7560.92 --> 7563.9490000000005
[Music]

7580.159 --> 7587.92
I just looked up moo and atmology and

7582.639 --> 7587.92
all it says is 1930s of Uncertain

7588.4 --> 7593.5199999999995
origin so moo is like a mystery

7594.639 --> 7599.559
word it might be tartarian in

7600.28 --> 7606.239
origin like how can we not know what

7603.199 --> 7609.119
where the hell moo comes

7606.239 --> 7612.119
from it's like not even a hundred years

7609.119 --> 7612.119
ago

7625.559 --> 7631.079000000001
so there's a

7628.44 --> 7634.839999999999
mystery what's the origin of the word

7631.079 --> 7634.84
moo where does it come

7635.4 --> 7642.159
from how did it pop up in the

7638.28 --> 7645.159
1930s and there is no

7642.159 --> 7645.159
knowledge of its

7646.159 --> 7651.44
atmology

7648.92 --> 7653.84
what why do I feel like it's such a

7651.44 --> 7653.839999999999
funny

7656.719 --> 7662.119
word and like why does it mean dumb and

7659.8 --> 7667.92
incompetent person when there's no

7662.119 --> 7667.92
atmology to it like how did this happen

7673.47 --> 7676.589
[Music]

7691.92 --> 7695.84
all right I'm going to get my copy you

7693.639 --> 7700.36
guys think about the origin of the word

7695.84 --> 7700.360000000001
moo I want to know

7730.44 --> 7734.4
for e

7779.15 --> 7782.259999999999
[Music]

7819.28 --> 7823.079
it's uplifting listening to the show FS

7822.0 --> 7826.88
okay

7823.079 --> 7826.88
nice glad you enjoyed

7842.719 --> 7847.4
it Friday was my show where I did the

7845.4 --> 7850.638999999999
whole

7847.4 --> 7853.239
weird heliocentric solution to gravity

7850.639 --> 7853.2390000000005
thing right

7853.719 --> 7862.159
I didn't really get a lot of responses

7857.639 --> 7862.159000000001
then I'm glad you were able to enjoy

7878.01 --> 7884.280000000001
[Music]

7880.239 --> 7884.28
it e

7910.91 --> 7914.09
[Music]

7929.0 --> 7936.0
oh wait fiber out you talking to

7932.32 --> 7941.159
clutch about the uh the new show yeah it

7936.0 --> 7941.159
was fun I listened to that

7974.239 --> 7983.239
all right so yeah if there's anything

7977.159 --> 7983.239
else I can clear up about ether for

7989.559 --> 7998.88
example and what the problem with it

7993.679 --> 7998.88
is what people think is either

8008.48 --> 8013.799999999999
or maybe you've just moved on into a

8011.079 --> 8016.159
little bit easier ground that's fine I

8013.8 --> 8020.28
mean it's Sunday

8016.159 --> 8020.28
and everybody's taking it

8024.559 --> 8028.84
easy as far as I'm concerned I already

8027.0 --> 8031.159
filled up the show with some really

8028.84 --> 8034.76
interesting conversation and esoteric in

8031.159 --> 8034.759999999999
sites which is like good enough for

8035.44 --> 8040.919999999999
me I don't have to keep squeezing it

8038.36 --> 8044.679
another hour or something so you guys

8040.92 --> 8046.92
could just do whatever you

8044.679 --> 8048.599
like I already got out of it what I

8046.92 --> 8052.2390000000005
wanted

8048.599 --> 8054.679
so and hopefully you were able to catch

8052.239 --> 8054.678999999999
some of

8059.719 --> 8065.2390000000005
that but yeah if you want more then just

8067.159 --> 8070.44
inquire or

8071.36 --> 8077.96
don't how can you say ether doesn't

8073.88 --> 8077.96
exist what's ether

8094.96 --> 8099.4800000000005
I mean it's not that difficult to do

8097.159 --> 8099.48
that at

8101.199 --> 8110.04
all I mean that statement to me is like

8106.48 --> 8112.638999999999
almost a clone of the same statement

8110.04 --> 8114.44
that could be made like how can you say

8112.639 --> 8119.0
gravity doesn't

8114.44 --> 8121.759999999999
exist yeah yeah with the similar answer

8119.0 --> 8125.52
what's gravity yeah see

8121.76 --> 8125.52
everything around us oh

8131.04 --> 8137.199
yes well I think that everything around

8135.44 --> 8139.558999999999
us

8137.199 --> 8143.04
exists I don't think everything around

8139.559 --> 8143.04
us is actually called

8149.48 --> 8153.718999999999
ether why would you call everything

8151.84 --> 8155.1990000000005
around us ether when it's just

8153.719 --> 8158.199
everything around

8155.199 --> 8164.199
us isn't everything around us

8158.199 --> 8164.199
basically the realm this place

8167.159 --> 8171.079
Earth why would you call that

8177.92 --> 8182.96
ether why how was deriving energy from

8181.559 --> 8184.52
The Ether

8182.96 --> 8187.52
prohibited

8184.52 --> 8187.52
oh

8188.679 --> 8194.519
uh what's your evidence for that boy

8192.2 --> 8196.92
what's your evidence that there was a

8194.519 --> 8200.800000000001
supposed ether that was energy was being

8196.92 --> 8202.559
derived from That Was Then forbidden to

8200.8 --> 8208.479
do

8202.559 --> 8208.479
that that's a presupposing a lot there

8227.76 --> 8234.639000000001
right and besides like I never claimed

8231.319 --> 8234.639
that energy isn't in the

8236.0 --> 8242.719
air I never said energy is not present

8239.2 --> 8242.719000000001
at all time

8243.8 --> 8248.279999999999
is that what the ether is according to

8246.319 --> 8250.88
you it's the energy that's present oh

8248.28 --> 8253.92
isn't that energy Just Energy isn't that

8250.88 --> 8253.92
just like yeah

8254.16 --> 8257.16
it's

8267.28 --> 8272.84
energy could it perhaps be that the

8269.559 --> 8272.84
energy is just resonant

8273.08 --> 8280.639
based that the energy doesn't really

8275.719 --> 8283.24
exist until material basically gets the

8280.639 --> 8284.639
perfect resonance which simply makes the

8283.24 --> 8286.92
energy

8284.639 --> 8290.119999999999
manifest why would you assume that the

8286.92 --> 8292.92
energy is already there and you are

8290.12 --> 8295.04
simply not tapping into it how do you

8292.92 --> 8297.439
know it's already there when you're not

8295.04 --> 8300.240000000002
tapping into

8297.439 --> 8302.359
it unless you just presuppose it's

8300.24 --> 8304.28
always there and that you can tap into

8302.359 --> 8307.399000000001
it but that it would still exist even if

8304.28 --> 8311.559000000001
you didn't tap into it so here's another

8307.399 --> 8315.399
train of thought what if it didn't exist

8311.559 --> 8320.559
until you tap into it which basically

8315.399 --> 8323.479
means manifested through specific

8320.559 --> 8325.96
structure that the structure makes the

8323.479 --> 8325.96
energy

8328.08 --> 8335.08
manifest but if you think like that

8331.479 --> 8339.039999999999
there is no necessity for the energy to

8335.08 --> 8341.679
exist when you don't manifest it no

8339.04 --> 8345.399000000001
ether It's Just Energy

8341.679 --> 8347.439
manifesting through specific

8345.399 --> 8348.84
structure does that mean that the

8347.439 --> 8352.639000000001
structure is

8348.84 --> 8354.639000000001
ether that the pattern of the structure

8352.639 --> 8357.639
which makes the energy manifest is The

8354.639 --> 8357.639
Ether

8360.96 --> 8364.919999999998
right the problem with ether and how

8362.559 --> 8367.358999999999
people regard it is that they assume

8364.92 --> 8370.2
it's always there that it's this energy

8367.359 --> 8372.84
thing that's just there and you can tap

8370.2 --> 8375.84
into it how do you know it exists when

8372.84 --> 8375.84
you don't tap into

8375.96 --> 8381.358999999999
it even calling it tapping into it is

8379.08 --> 8382.479
assuming it's there and that you're like

8381.359 --> 8386.08
reaching

8382.479 --> 8387.72
out and utilizing that thing which youe

8386.08 --> 8392.0
assume is

8387.72 --> 8392.0
already in existence

8392.2 --> 8397.0
when you have no actual evidence for

8394.319 --> 8399.96
that what if it's just the structure

8397.0 --> 8402.88
that makes the energy manifest right

8399.96 --> 8406.759999999998
just like relative density this

8402.88 --> 8408.92
equilibrium makes the force of vertical

8406.76 --> 8411.0
passive displacement

8408.92 --> 8412.88
manifest like there is nothing

8411.0 --> 8416.0
vertically

8412.88 --> 8417.679999999998
displacing until there is a dise

8416.0 --> 8419.96
equilibrium with an object and the

8417.68 --> 8421.24
medium it is in and then suddenly the

8419.96 --> 8425.479
force man

8421.24 --> 8425.479
where before it wasn't

8426.64 --> 8432.399
there yeah and that's provable that's

8429.96 --> 8432.399
actually

8434.56 --> 8439.88
scientific right well presupposing that

8437.2 --> 8443.640000000001
there's always a force there and

8439.88 --> 8445.599999999999
material is simply being subjected to it

8443.64 --> 8449.119999999999
well that's

8445.6 --> 8452.640000000001
false that's the theory of

8449.12 --> 8452.640000000001
gravity newon

8453.359 --> 8459.800000000001
or even not even Newton just little G

8457.0 --> 8461.319
gravity Things Fall go down go boom boom

8459.8 --> 8462.96
because there's a force that's

8461.319 --> 8465.84
everything is being subjected to it

8462.96 --> 8469.56
presupposes it you can't prove it's

8465.84 --> 8472.04
there though you can only presuppose it

8469.56 --> 8474.68
so it's exactly the same thing as this

8472.04 --> 8476.160000000002
damn ether you're just assuming the

8474.68 --> 8480.319
energy is

8476.16 --> 8482.16
there and that you can tap into it how

8480.319 --> 8484.76
do you know it's there when you don't

8482.16 --> 8484.76
tap into

8486.04 --> 8493.399000000001
it what if you manifested through

8490.24 --> 8496.8
structure the energy comes into being

8493.399 --> 8499.24
because of the very specific way

8496.8 --> 8502.759999999998
material is

8499.24 --> 8502.76
organized because of

8503.0 --> 8507.6
patterns maybe the patterns just

8505.439 --> 8510.0
manifest the energy where before they

8507.6 --> 8512.08
weren't the energy wasn't there just

8510.0 --> 8515.8
like relative density dis

8512.08 --> 8519.64
equilibrium manifests a partic vertical

8515.8 --> 8524.0
passive displacement Force where before

8519.64 --> 8527.199999999999
the dise equilibrium there was no

8524.0 --> 8527.2
Force you

8527.56 --> 8536.039999999999
see that way you can stay in the really

8531.8 --> 8540.64
is level that way you can actually stay

8536.04 --> 8540.640000000001
within scientific provable grounds

8543.479 --> 8550.358999999999
if you keep presupposing something is

8545.68 --> 8553.319
there even when you have no reason to

8550.359 --> 8556.24
assume it is there other than you want

8553.319 --> 8560.359
the consistency of assuming that it is

8556.24 --> 8563.0
there so that it is consistent

8560.359 --> 8565.84
well that's not scientific then that

8563.0 --> 8568.8
you're not going with what is really

8565.84 --> 8570.52
there you're leaning on the Assumption

8568.8 --> 8572.319
of something being there without being

8570.52 --> 8575.68
able to prove

8572.319 --> 8578.88
it you're just assuming it for

8575.68 --> 8579.68
consistency's sake the consistency of

8578.88 --> 8582.16
your

8579.68 --> 8584.68
thought that's not proof that's not

8582.16 --> 8584.68
physical

8590.25 --> 8593.43
[Music]

8593.92 --> 8598.68
proof what causes density

8604.479 --> 8610.449999999999
what what causes density

8607.39 --> 8610.449999999999
[Music]

8616.92 --> 8621.76
God

8618.479 --> 8623.319
the the summary of the subatomic

8621.76 --> 8626.72
particles

8623.319 --> 8631.96
versus the way they crystallize like how

8626.72 --> 8631.96
compact they they crystallize

8632.68 --> 8639.84
so yeah I mean

8636.0 --> 8639.84
density is just the

8640.52 --> 8645.24
density why does

8642.64 --> 8649.479
material crystallize the way it does

8645.24 --> 8649.479
well because that's how it works

8670.359 --> 8676.439
I don't see what static electricity has

8672.6 --> 8676.439
to do with anything concerning that

8676.72 --> 8682.479
chahona yeah static electricity is not

8679.24 --> 8682.479
the cause of relative

8683.359 --> 8690.880000000001
density static electricity is not the

8687.6 --> 8692.720000000001
passive displacement Factor

8690.88 --> 8694.96
in the realm it's not the cause of it

8692.72 --> 8698.72
because it has it is very

8694.96 --> 8701.16
measurable it has a limited distance and

8698.72 --> 8701.16
it is

8701.399 --> 8706.88
erratic yeah well guess what a lot of

8704.8 --> 8709.759999999998
things are passively displaced

8706.88 --> 8714.199999999999
displacing all over the place without

8709.76 --> 8715.800000000001
any static charge being measured that is

8714.2 --> 8721.359
like in

8715.8 --> 8724.679999999998
sync with that passive displacement

8721.359 --> 8727.04
yeah the reach of static electricity is

8724.68 --> 8727.04
very

8730.0 --> 8736.279
limited supposed gravity is not static

8733.72 --> 8739.479
electricity and relative

8736.279 --> 8741.52
density like yeah static electricity has

8739.479 --> 8746.679999999998
no bearing on

8741.52 --> 8746.68
that it's separated from it

8752.72 --> 8757.039999999999
there has to be something to do with

8754.88 --> 8758.72
magnetics okay well yeah sure there's

8757.04 --> 8760.880000000001
magnetics there's a magnetic field

8758.72 --> 8764.8
there's a geomagnetic

8760.88 --> 8769.8
field does that have to do with

8764.8 --> 8769.8
gravity or the energy that's in the

8773.479 --> 8781.599999999999
air prove it then show the direct

8778.08 --> 8784.52
connection prove the causal Rel

8781.6 --> 8787.84
it's not there they're just separate

8784.52 --> 8790.479000000001
factors that are

8787.84 --> 8792.880000000001
there one doesn't cause the other the

8790.479 --> 8795.199999999999
other doesn't cause the one it's just

8792.88 --> 8798.0
it's not there the connection is not

8795.2 --> 8800.880000000001
there just because there's a plora of

8798.0 --> 8803.279
things doesn't mean they are all

8800.88 --> 8806.0
unified yeah that's the problem it's

8803.279 --> 8809.0
it's again the unification theorists

8806.0 --> 8809.0
that do this to

8809.08 --> 8814.24
you yeah yeah over unification

8812.72 --> 8819.199999999999
unification

8814.24 --> 8821.92
Beyond proof Beyond logic that's the

8819.2 --> 8824.12
problem it's unification theorists that

8821.92 --> 8827.88
are responsible for doing this for

8824.12 --> 8827.880000000001
creating this ether

8828.479 --> 8834.56
mythology claiming there is unification

8831.24 --> 8837.56
when there isn't

8834.56 --> 8837.56
any

8838.359 --> 8845.640000000001
yeah no matter how much you want it

8842.04 --> 8850.2
there isn't it's not

8845.64 --> 8850.199999999999
unified correlation is not

8851.16 --> 8854.298999999999
[Music]

8855.68 --> 8861.04
causation you speak of the akashik

8858.439 --> 8864.04
records do could you prove

8861.04 --> 8864.04
that

8868.439 --> 8872.76
no I can only find out

8872.8 --> 8878.599999999999
how information is just like discovered

8876.359 --> 8881.439
from scratch and

8878.6 --> 8885.399000000001
how thought patterns

8881.439 --> 8886.56
unfold the same way so information is

8885.399 --> 8889.72
stumbled

8886.56 --> 8893.439
upon in a consistent way and conclusions

8889.72 --> 8896.519999999999
are drawn consistently like even if the

8893.439 --> 8899.12
people that stumble upon it have

8896.52 --> 8900.92
no knowledge of each other aren't even

8899.12 --> 8904.76
in the same time per

8900.92 --> 8907.88
period stumbling upon information will

8904.76 --> 8910.2
yield the Consciousness to draw the same

8907.88 --> 8913.278999999999
conclusions that

8910.2 --> 8915.08
is part of the reason why I think there

8913.279 --> 8920.08
is an akashic

8915.08 --> 8924.8
record it's just a a basis information

8920.08 --> 8924.8
structure that deals with everything

8931.96 --> 8937.358999999999
something we could know something but we

8934.399 --> 8940.96
can't prove it it is my point yeah but I

8937.359 --> 8944.52
mean the akashic record is anything but

8940.96 --> 8947.278999999999
a scientific claim and it is definitely

8944.52 --> 8951.439
not a

8947.279 --> 8956.479000000001
phenomenon yeah this is an ethereal

8951.439 --> 8956.479000000001
spiritual Paradigm based

8957.0 --> 8962.04
idea there's no science that is

8973.2 --> 8980.720000000001
claimed yeah I mean you could scoop the

8977.439 --> 8983.479000000001
akashic record up and just say like the

8980.72 --> 8985.96
akashic record is proof of The Ether

8983.479 --> 8989.399
yeah and you know that some people do

8985.96 --> 8993.919999999998
that yeah but I'm not claiming the

8989.399 --> 8997.519999999999
akashic record is a proof for ether it's

8993.92 --> 9001.68
just another fascinating

8997.52 --> 9005.24
structure that is

9001.68 --> 9006.800000000001
separate that's the point it's

9005.24 --> 9011.64
separate

9006.8 --> 9015.679999999998
separatists yeah non unification based

9011.64 --> 9017.24
unification theorists [ __ ] everything

9015.68 --> 9019.68
up

9017.24 --> 9020.72
everything all the interesting things

9019.68 --> 9022.720000000001
that are

9020.72 --> 9026.119999999999
discovered that are

9022.72 --> 9028.92
consistent they just put it all together

9026.12 --> 9032.359
like beads on a on a necklace and just

9028.92 --> 9035.04
like it's one thing yeah no it isn't a

9032.359 --> 9037.640000000001
thing it's not one

9035.04 --> 9039.720000000001
thing they're separate things

9037.64 --> 9043.358999999999
correlation is not causation yeah I

9039.72 --> 9045.119999999999
don't claim a unification Theory based

9043.359 --> 9047.720000000001
on the aashik

9045.12 --> 9050.560000000001
record the akashic record is merely

9047.72 --> 9052.319
pointing out like logical information

9050.56 --> 9055.72
structure and how the Consciousness

9052.319 --> 9059.64
deals with discovery of new information

9055.72 --> 9062.8
and how it proceeds is consistent and

9059.64 --> 9065.278999999999
repeatable sub you can literally test

9062.8 --> 9068.199999999999
this by having people a whole bunch of

9065.279 --> 9072.12
people thousands of people and all one

9068.2 --> 9074.279
by one test them by subjecting them to

9072.12 --> 9078.399000000001
specific types of information that

9074.279 --> 9083.08
they're very unlikely to have bumped

9078.399 --> 9085.96
into and just see how they respond to it

9083.08 --> 9087.439
the way they will respond to it will be

9085.96 --> 9090.919999999998
very

9087.439 --> 9093.68
consistent why because that's how

9090.92 --> 9093.68
information

9093.76 --> 9098.399
works that's how our Consciousness

9096.2 --> 9100.6
responds to information

9098.399 --> 9103.88
consistently there is a

9100.6 --> 9107.640000000001
consistent consistent nature to it that

9103.88 --> 9111.56
consistent nature is what makes it into

9107.64 --> 9115.319
a unified akashic record and not just

9111.56 --> 9117.24
chaos where oh you hear the idea oh well

9115.319 --> 9120.64
my train of thinking is going to unroll

9117.24 --> 9122.039999999999
completely different to everybody else's

9120.64 --> 9125.0
no no

9122.04 --> 9129.080000000002
people figure out the same ideas in

9125.0 --> 9132.96
response to the same information that

9129.08 --> 9137.76
consistency points at there being a

9132.96 --> 9137.759999999998
unified Foundation of information

9144.99 --> 9149.64
[Music]

9146.68 --> 9152.64
right and yeah you can call that ether

9149.64 --> 9154.92
and say oh it's all one thing yeah you

9152.64 --> 9157.479
could do that there's no proof for it

9154.92 --> 9159.8
though what there is proof of is the

9157.479 --> 9162.438999999998
consistency of information and how the

9159.8 --> 9165.319
Consciousness responds to

9162.439 --> 9168.68
it like just that one thing that one

9165.319 --> 9170.359
thing amazing akashic record based on

9168.68 --> 9171.24
that one thing

9170.359 --> 9175.319
that's

9171.24 --> 9178.84
it that's the extent of the claim that

9175.319 --> 9180.76
is the extent of the aceric implication

9178.84 --> 9185.72
of

9180.76 --> 9189.84
it it's not part of a unification

9185.72 --> 9196.119999999999
Theory it's just one

9189.84 --> 9196.12
component not a part of a whole thing

9212.04 --> 9218.12
yeah so for example like just think

9215.52 --> 9220.399000000001
about it ethereum what what do what is

9218.12 --> 9222.08
the part of what they say

9220.399 --> 9226.119999999999
right

9222.08 --> 9228.52
the dialectric nature between magnetism

9226.12 --> 9230.279
and electricity like the Dual nature

9228.52 --> 9232.720000000001
between it the one is the the other

9230.279 --> 9235.319000000001
becomes to one

9232.72 --> 9236.438999999998
right why would you call that ether when

9235.319 --> 9237.96
it's

9236.439 --> 9239.56
just

9237.96 --> 9243.08
electromagnetic

9239.56 --> 9249.119999999999
nature it's its own thing it's separate

9243.08 --> 9255.12
it's magical it's amazing why is that a

9249.12 --> 9258.800000000001
bead in the necklace of ether

9255.12 --> 9261.720000000001
why it's just its own thing it's magical

9258.8 --> 9261.72
it's fascinating

9262.12 --> 9266.359
why does it have to be unified in

9271.64 --> 9277.84
someo 80% of the Consciousness today

9274.76 --> 9280.72
thinks the Earth is a globe really based

9277.84 --> 9280.72
on what

9281.359 --> 9288.0
Shaha I mean

9283.92 --> 9290.92
99% of statistics about what is

9288.0 --> 9293.64
what are made of on the

9290.92 --> 9295.68
spot and it sounds like the claim that

9293.64 --> 9298.358999999999
you're putting down right there is one

9295.68 --> 9303.2
of those

9298.359 --> 9303.2
99% of just completely made up on the

9306.68 --> 9311.76
spot and do you really think it is a

9309.399 --> 9313.278999999999
globe or you simply not thinking about

9311.76 --> 9316.24
it and just

9313.279 --> 9319.16
accepting something without thinking

9316.24 --> 9321.399
about it is the Consciousness involved

9319.16 --> 9324.399
in the perception of the Earth being a

9321.399 --> 9327.24
globe or is it just not thought about

9324.399 --> 9329.96
and assumed in the

9327.24 --> 9332.039999999999
background because of exposure you're

9329.96 --> 9334.438999999998
just trusting on that the thing that

9332.04 --> 9337.560000000001
you're being exposed to the most in

9334.439 --> 9340.880000000001
regards to it as a concept is the truth

9337.56 --> 9343.24
so you believe that the majority of how

9340.88 --> 9345.599999999999
people think of it and how the

9343.24 --> 9349.279
information is being spread around is

9345.6 --> 9349.279
based on the truth

9354.0 --> 9357.359
where does the Consciousness come

9359.64 --> 9365.599999999999
in no

9361.72 --> 9365.599999999999
it's it's not the

9365.72 --> 9371.8
Consciousness people think the Earth is

9367.96 --> 9374.16
a globe because they're not conscious

9371.8 --> 9374.16
about

9377.96 --> 9386.08
it cuz if they were they put it all

9381.359 --> 9386.08
together then they know it's not a globe

9416.08 --> 9420.16
I'm missing the point am I

9428.88 --> 9433.319
really and what point would that be

9438.52 --> 9442.479000000001
Shana e

9473.399 --> 9479.119999999999
yeah no fibras of course I mean that's

9475.92 --> 9481.8
like the empath versus the zombie if

9479.12 --> 9483.52
you're an empath everything can bother

9481.8 --> 9486.0
you everything will influence you you

9483.52 --> 9489.52
will feel very vulnerable because you're

9486.0 --> 9491.68
just everything touches you more but you

9489.52 --> 9494.960000000001
don't envy those that don't have it

9491.68 --> 9498.24
because to compared to you they're just

9494.96 --> 9501.438999999998
numbed down and think just go move past

9498.24 --> 9501.439
them without them picking it up

9512.52 --> 9518.560000000001
like your Consciousness sticks out picks

9514.96 --> 9521.599999999999
up on more and other people like you can

9518.56 --> 9522.72
tell that they are not resonating it

9521.6 --> 9526.2
that they

9522.72 --> 9529.88
don't pick up on it that they don't see

9526.2 --> 9531.84
the further detail in the akashic record

9529.88 --> 9534.16
you can tell when people don't pick up

9531.84 --> 9534.16
on

9534.52 --> 9540.08
information when their Consciousness

9536.8 --> 9540.08
doesn't provide the

9541.359 --> 9547.479000000001
reach because of how they respond or

9544.2 --> 9547.479000000001
more importantly how they don't

9550.88 --> 9556.599999999999
respond that's that no matter how much

9554.399 --> 9558.68
we do we're never going to convince the

9556.6 --> 9561.800000000001
majority conscious who says we're

9558.68 --> 9561.800000000001
supposed to do

9562.52 --> 9569.68
that sh that's not my

9566.439 --> 9571.52
mission convince the majority no the

9569.68 --> 9573.279
whole point is is that the majority

9571.52 --> 9575.84
doesn't want it they all run away

9573.279 --> 9578.52
because they can't handle the truth they

9575.84 --> 9581.56
don't want to handle the truth and they

9578.52 --> 9584.08
don't plan to ever be a become capable

9581.56 --> 9587.199999999999
of handling the

9584.08 --> 9590.84
truth yeah it's not about that other

9587.2 --> 9593.359
side they are the Yang to my Ying they

9590.84 --> 9595.8
are the sleepers to are

9593.359 --> 9598.24
awakened it's not about whether they're

9595.8 --> 9603.08
going to side with us it's whether how

9598.24 --> 9606.96
far can we make it how deep can we

9603.08 --> 9608.88
go the deeper we go the more superficial

9606.96 --> 9612.08
they will

9608.88 --> 9615.72
become because that's how it balances

9612.08 --> 9619.359
out that's just the way things

9615.72 --> 9625.24
are yeah the deeper our Insight the more

9619.359 --> 9627.12
baffling their superficial idiocy and

9625.24 --> 9630.8
obliviousness

9627.12 --> 9633.52
cuz the brighter we shine the more they

9630.8 --> 9636.119999999999
have to numb their themselves down just

9633.52 --> 9639.92
to not be able to pick up on

9636.12 --> 9643.279
it because they can't handle it people

9639.92 --> 9645.68
become dumb because they don't they

9643.279 --> 9648.479000000001
can't handle the

9645.68 --> 9651.12
truth it's not that that truth makes

9648.479 --> 9654.08
them dumb it's that they defensively

9651.12 --> 9657.279
have to dumb themselves down just so

9654.08 --> 9659.88
that they don't get hit by the higher

9657.279 --> 9661.68
Insight that will disrupt their system

9659.88 --> 9663.64
and their balance and their vantage

9661.68 --> 9666.2
point of their Consciousness which is

9663.64 --> 9668.16
where they're working at Consciousness

9666.2 --> 9670.960000000001
works at a certain vantage point if you

9668.16 --> 9673.319
get information that supersedes that

9670.96 --> 9675.519999999999
vantage point of Consciousness it's

9673.319 --> 9677.399
going to disrupt your entire being and

9675.52 --> 9679.92
your entire

9677.399 --> 9682.039999999999
process create chaos

9679.92 --> 9685.52
in order to stabilize and prevent the

9682.04 --> 9688.319000000001
chaos you have to be dumber and not pick

9685.52 --> 9691.479000000001
up on the information that would disrupt

9688.319 --> 9691.479
the vantage point of your

9693.08 --> 9697.88
Consciousness if that is indeed what you

9695.64 --> 9699.72
want to do if you are on that ground

9697.88 --> 9701.358999999999
that is your ground that is your Vantage

9699.72 --> 9703.599999999999
Point that's the thing that you want to

9701.359 --> 9706.84
perfect at that

9703.6 --> 9709.359
level right if you've already

9706.84 --> 9711.8
completed that frequency and you have

9709.359 --> 9713.84
have all the sites you know it is

9711.8 --> 9715.599999999999
complete there's you feel there's

9713.84 --> 9717.56
nothing more to learn from that vantage

9715.6 --> 9720.880000000001
point of Consciousness well then you

9717.56 --> 9723.439
might choose not to dumb yourself down

9720.88 --> 9726.56
in order to be influenced by the higher

9723.439 --> 9728.76
Consciousness Insight that will disrupt

9726.56 --> 9732.64
your Vantage Point lift you up to

9728.76 --> 9733.72
another level and then you can work on

9732.64 --> 9736.519999999999
that

9733.72 --> 9739.92
level but if you're not done with your

9736.52 --> 9742.2
level yet it's more likely that you will

9739.92 --> 9745.2
automatically subconsciously dumb

9742.2 --> 9746.76
yourself down in order to not understand

9745.2 --> 9750.12
the higher Consciousness based

9746.76 --> 9752.880000000001
implications of the information so that

9750.12 --> 9754.560000000001
you don't change your Vantage Point so

9752.88 --> 9756.759999999998
that you can keep working on what you

9754.56 --> 9760.199999999999
were working on until you are satisfied

9756.76 --> 9760.2
that it is complete

9776.24 --> 9780.72
the clouds are coming that clouds are uh

9781.64 --> 9786.519999999999
oh yeah there no clouds over here but it

9784.6 --> 9790.800000000001
like before the show started it did

9786.52 --> 9793.479000000001
actually hail like literal ice hail

9790.8 --> 9798.0
stones that was

9793.479 --> 9798.0
weird it all melted away like in

9798.12 --> 9804.720000000001
seconds didn't expect haill stones in

9801.359 --> 9808.319
late May that was weird by the way may

9804.72 --> 9812.96
is freaking flying past isn't it can't

9808.319 --> 9812.96
believe it's almost already June crazy

9814.08 --> 9821.039999999999
stuff why are you here doing this then

9817.76 --> 9824.319
clarification showing you the

9821.04 --> 9826.04
Ethereal esoteric structures of

9824.319 --> 9828.119999999999
Consciousness and how The Meta

9826.04 --> 9831.04
structures The Meta structures of

9828.12 --> 9835.279
Consciousness how deals with information

9831.04 --> 9837.2
why to clarify how people do things

9835.279 --> 9839.04
that's from your vantage point of a

9837.2 --> 9841.960000000001
higher conscious will seem like they're

9839.04 --> 9845.359
actively dumbing themselves down while

9841.96 --> 9847.839999999998
if you displace your cons Consciousness

9845.359 --> 9849.68
into their apparent vantage point and

9847.84 --> 9851.279
realize that they are a person that they

9849.68 --> 9854.24
are doing things for a

9851.279 --> 9856.960000000001
reason and that there's processes that

9854.24 --> 9858.6
people work on that require a stable

9856.96 --> 9861.479
vantage point of their Consciousness and

9858.6 --> 9864.16
they can't just keep jumping up because

9861.479 --> 9867.399
then you leave behind incomplete

9864.16 --> 9870.88
staircases as it were and if you fall

9867.399 --> 9873.16
back you don't know your way back up you

9870.88 --> 9876.16
need to

9873.16 --> 9878.319
complete your work from a certain

9876.16 --> 9880.439
vantage point of

9878.319 --> 9883.24
Consciousness you can't just keep

9880.439 --> 9887.08
jumping unless you're already satisfied

9883.24 --> 9887.08
that you're done there

9890.319 --> 9896.439
right so this is like why people can't

9893.52 --> 9898.800000000001
handle the truth there's a reason why

9896.439 --> 9903.08
people can't handle the truth based on

9898.8 --> 9903.08
the processes that transpire

9903.2 --> 9908.399000000001
naturally there is like way more

9905.76 --> 9910.68
information than people can naturally

9908.399 --> 9912.84
handle and that information is a lot of

9910.68 --> 9914.800000000001
it exposed and the more it becomes

9912.84 --> 9917.8
exposed the less people will be capable

9914.8 --> 9919.84
of handling it they can only take

9917.8 --> 9923.039999999999
certain things

9919.84 --> 9926.319
one piece at a time they have to

9923.04 --> 9929.439
build based on their vantage point of

9926.319 --> 9932.0
Consciousness to get the staircase done

9929.439 --> 9933.880000000001
in the face of overwhelming amounts of

9932.0 --> 9936.439
information that is simultaneously

9933.88 --> 9939.399
available but they can't handle it they

9936.439 --> 9942.68
have to approach things only from one

9939.399 --> 9946.599999999999
certain conscious Fantage point in order

9942.68 --> 9950.92
to gain confidence about that

9946.6 --> 9950.92
level of conscious insight

9952.399 --> 9957.319
and then once they're done with that

9954.84 --> 9960.92
when they've been in a certain way for a

9957.319 --> 9963.8
while become intuitively comfortable

9960.92 --> 9965.439
with it that they know it that they know

9963.8 --> 9967.24
the ins and the

9965.439 --> 9970.92
outs

9967.24 --> 9973.08
then then it becomes a more viable

9970.92 --> 9975.479
option to be carried away by a higher

9973.08 --> 9978.399
Consciousness onto a new

9975.479 --> 9981.278999999999
level now they can handle the truth now

9978.399 --> 9982.8
suddenly where before they were like I

9981.279 --> 9986.12
don't want to hear about that Suddenly

9982.8 --> 9988.519999999999
It's like yeah yeah I get it whoa this

9986.12 --> 9988.52
is

9989.479 --> 9995.039999999999
amazing

9992.399 --> 9996.92
right hey and if you're like really

9995.04 --> 9998.6
actively hungry for new or higher

9996.92 --> 10000.92
frequencies doesn't always mean that you

9998.6 --> 10003.68
can actually handle them a lot of people

10000.92 --> 10005.359
are like always curious they always

10003.68 --> 10009.12
ready to hear anything out but then when

10005.359 --> 10010.800000000001
they heard it they didn't get it even if

10009.12 --> 10013.92
wanted

10010.8 --> 10015.96
to it'll just bounce off because they

10013.92 --> 10019.24
didn't have the foundations they didn't

10015.96 --> 10019.24
build the staircase

10020.72 --> 10024.64
below yeah you can have a really higher

10023.24 --> 10026.88
conscious you can have like the most

10024.64 --> 10027.8
amazing esoteric Insight from Jesus

10026.88 --> 10030.039999999999
Christ

10027.8 --> 10031.92
himself if you haven't built your

10030.04 --> 10034.240000000002
foundations all it'll mean to you is

10031.92 --> 10036.12
like wow that's so great it's so amazing

10034.24 --> 10038.24
and then you'll just forget about it and

10036.12 --> 10040.560000000001
you'll just stumble back way to the

10038.24 --> 10042.8
beginning

10040.56 --> 10045.88
where you left off because you got to

10042.8 --> 10048.039999999999
build the lower consciousnesses

10045.88 --> 10050.56
up you got to have a foundation you're

10048.04 --> 10050.560000000001
building a

10050.6 --> 10056.399000000001
staircase for yourself and if you don't

10053.52 --> 10059.08
build those lower stairs then you will

10056.399 --> 10063.399
fall fall down to where you left

10059.08 --> 10063.399
off every time

10082.8 --> 10087.84
that is a MC from Corum Quantum

10094.84 --> 10104.0
reference Ship of Fools yeah yeah

10099.52 --> 10104.0
yeah Ship of Fools the autopilot

10105.479 --> 10110.278999999999
the the safe opinion

10110.52 --> 10114.960000000001
option where you have less control over

10112.96 --> 10117.399
yourself because you have less grip but

10114.96 --> 10120.199999999999
you can stay

10117.399 --> 10122.599999999999
safe or seeming to stay safe on the

10120.2 --> 10124.6
social level you will be perceived as

10122.6 --> 10127.720000000001
safe because you're with the Ship of

10124.6 --> 10130.359
Fools even though practically it isn't

10127.72 --> 10133.119999999999
safe but it'll feel

10130.359 --> 10134.439
safe Stairway to Heaven yeah you could

10133.12 --> 10137.84
call it that you could call it The

10134.439 --> 10137.84
Stairway to Heaven Lucy level

10143.24 --> 10148.56
hello it's good to try and change

10145.6 --> 10148.56
people's minds

10148.6 --> 10154.359
no it's weird like CH trying to change

10151.68 --> 10157.399
people's minds

10154.359 --> 10160.2
is like that's the wrong emphasis of

10157.399 --> 10164.0
Your Action like you should

10160.2 --> 10166.12
just present Alternatives give more

10164.0 --> 10170.399
clear structures that

10166.12 --> 10170.399000000001
will allow them better

10179.76 --> 10185.12
options so they can choose more wisely

10189.04 --> 10193.2
right and if you give them an option

10190.64 --> 10194.84
that is effectively a more Wise Choice

10193.2 --> 10196.76
then even in the moment they might not

10194.84 --> 10200.76
be able to accept

10196.76 --> 10204.319
that but if it is wise enough then over

10200.76 --> 10208.16
time it can linger sink in and then

10204.319 --> 10213.359
become acceptable later on because of

10208.16 --> 10213.359
the wisdom it endured time

10219.239 --> 10224.319
that's the whole awesome thing about

10221.16 --> 10225.72
wisdom is that it it surv it endures and

10224.319 --> 10228.96
survives

10225.72 --> 10228.96
time it's

10229.359 --> 10234.16
durable so even if in the moment there's

10232.16 --> 10236.0
some kind of short-term reason or a

10234.16 --> 10240.279
personal reason or an emotional reason

10236.0 --> 10243.64
or any kind of reason to not not accept

10240.279 --> 10249.92
it to choose against it that's fine but

10243.64 --> 10249.92
then over time it'll still sit there

10251.16 --> 10259.119999999999
and like the consistency of it will

10256.56 --> 10261.278999999999
remain and that's what makes it wise and

10259.12 --> 10264.08
that's what makes it more alluring on

10261.279 --> 10267.08
the long run to actually assimilate that

10264.08 --> 10267.08
wisdom

10291.72 --> 10299.199999999999
I'm very inspired

10294.92 --> 10301.16
today I feel way more awake too so I'm

10299.2 --> 10304.399000000001
happy about that yesterday I just felt

10301.16 --> 10305.6
so toasty I just was like still around

10304.399 --> 10309.76
this time

10305.6 --> 10311.960000000001
like like oo 2 hours and 50 minutes I

10309.76 --> 10314.800000000001
can't wait to run out to show like I'm

10311.96 --> 10320.399
not feeling like that at all now I'm

10314.8 --> 10323.319
like yeah esoterics man I'm just like

10320.399 --> 10326.519999999999
guzzling Down The Ether structures and

10323.319 --> 10328.92
the the Ethereal structures and laying

10326.52 --> 10332.6
it down laying down the consistent

10328.92 --> 10334.68
wisdom I'm like just opening a big door

10332.6 --> 10337.720000000001
into the akashic record and everybody

10334.68 --> 10339.439
could just see straight in there like

10337.72 --> 10341.08
yeah this is the perspective of that

10339.439 --> 10343.880000000001
that's how that works it works like that

10341.08 --> 10346.92
with everybody and this is this is how

10343.88 --> 10349.16
you how an empath can simply go to the

10346.92 --> 10352.16
other person's conscious Vantage Point

10349.16 --> 10353.64
whatever it may be whoever they might be

10352.16 --> 10356.6
and just like

10353.64 --> 10360.119999999999
logically reconstruct or reverse

10356.6 --> 10362.720000000001
engineer their Vantage Point without

10360.12 --> 10368.160000000002
your own

10362.72 --> 10369.039999999999
opinions coloring that so you can get a

10368.16 --> 10372.039999999999
prop

10369.04 --> 10376.84
[Music]

10372.04 --> 10379.439
simulation of them to size up how

10376.84 --> 10379.439
they're going to

10380.279 --> 10386.76
respond like reverse engineer other

10383.92 --> 10390.319
people's Consciousness how they're most

10386.76 --> 10394.399
likely to respond to things and like

10390.319 --> 10398.119999999999
give a more weight impactful weighted

10394.399 --> 10399.039999999999
reason as to why people can't handle the

10398.12 --> 10400.239000000001
truth

10399.04 --> 10402.160000000002
right because if you just say people

10400.239 --> 10404.84
can't handle the truth what do you feel

10402.16 --> 10408.359
you demoralized you feel

10404.84 --> 10413.12
like is Humanity that

10408.359 --> 10416.52
stupid but once you explain

10413.12 --> 10420.160000000002
why then it's not that

10416.52 --> 10421.640000000001
stupid you'll be a if you understand why

10420.16 --> 10423.52
people can't handle the truth how that

10421.64 --> 10425.319
works how the Consciousness builds and

10423.52 --> 10428.0
needs to build their own level in their

10425.319 --> 10429.08
own time then you realize like no people

10428.0 --> 10433.239
just need

10429.08 --> 10435.439
time it's they're not even stupid just

10433.239 --> 10437.239
because they can't handle the truth

10435.439 --> 10440.319
doesn't even mean they're stupid it just

10437.239 --> 10442.96
means they're not ready for that level

10440.319 --> 10444.92
they have to build up their lower levels

10442.96 --> 10447.039999999999
first before they can reach that and

10444.92 --> 10449.479
that might take time and that might be

10447.04 --> 10451.68
very inconvenient to another conscious

10449.479 --> 10455.278999999999
that's already built those lower

10451.68 --> 10457.16
levels and wants to move Beyond wants

10455.279 --> 10459.12
wants to move further

10457.16 --> 10461.039999999999
up and

10459.12 --> 10463.0
the person that's not ready for that

10461.04 --> 10465.359
well they just can't oblige they just

10463.0 --> 10467.0
can't handle that truth it's not because

10465.359 --> 10468.0
they're stupid it's just because they

10467.0 --> 10471.72
need

10468.0 --> 10473.92
to still grow towards that and once they

10471.72 --> 10478.319
accomplish that let's say like 10 years

10473.92 --> 10480.68
later or whatever they might be way more

10478.319 --> 10483.0
wise than the other person that was

10480.68 --> 10486.279
their

10483.0 --> 10488.56
first they might end up wiser more

10486.279 --> 10489.640000000001
insightful than the person that got

10488.56 --> 10493.039999999999
there

10489.64 --> 10493.039999999999
first at the

10495.439 --> 10503.479000000001
time because there

10497.64 --> 10503.479
is a value to people that build

10504.359 --> 10511.960000000001
slowly if you build slowly more

10509.04 --> 10515.399000000001
carefully more

10511.96 --> 10519.199999999999
considerate take your time

10515.399 --> 10523.439
then flaws in the foundation structure

10519.2 --> 10527.720000000001
are less likely to appear on the long

10523.439 --> 10530.92
run if your foundation is more detailed

10527.72 --> 10534.278999999999
more carefully placed yeah it might take

10530.92 --> 10537.76
longer for you to build up but once it's

10534.279 --> 10540.6
build up it is very

10537.76 --> 10542.800000000001
reliable compared to those that are just

10540.6 --> 10545.2
really rushing it to get to that top to

10542.8 --> 10546.88
be on top and like oh I'm on top of the

10545.2 --> 10548.560000000001
world I build this pyramid really

10546.88 --> 10550.358999999999
quickly

10548.56 --> 10551.72
and then the pyramid collapses really

10550.359 --> 10553.239
quickly and they have to start from

10551.72 --> 10555.0
scratch and then they just become

10553.239 --> 10557.8
terrible Builders they keep building to

10555.0 --> 10560.439
that top but just it keeps

10557.8 --> 10562.56
collapsing because they didn't build the

10560.439 --> 10566.16
foundation properly they didn't take

10562.56 --> 10566.16
their time they they rushed to

10569.8 --> 10575.92
it in a way in order to reach the end

10573.0 --> 10579.68
and master the end of that building

10575.92 --> 10581.04
process you need to let it go

10579.68 --> 10584.12
you need

10581.04 --> 10586.880000000001
to accept that you're going to have to

10584.12 --> 10592.319000000001
build every

10586.88 --> 10592.319
part and not just only want the end

10593.96 --> 10599.919999999998
result and then at the end if you've

10596.6 --> 10604.16
done that you realize that every level

10599.92 --> 10606.64
of it is all of it and that without

10604.16 --> 10608.96
having focused carefully on the lower

10606.64 --> 10613.239
levels there is no strength for the

10608.96 --> 10616.039999999999
upper levels you start to see and

10613.239 --> 10618.64
feel how it is

10616.04 --> 10621.640000000001
important and not just the means to an

10618.64 --> 10621.64
end

10644.8 --> 10649.119999999999
okay

10645.88 --> 10650.88
sh sorry I'm not trying to go against

10649.12 --> 10653.92
anybody I'm just like

10650.88 --> 10656.16
really putting down this esoteric piece

10653.92 --> 10656.16
of

10661.399 --> 10667.479
information I'm actually this is even

10663.8 --> 10667.479
better for the title

10669.79 --> 10672.959
[Applause]

10678.86 --> 10682.04
[Music]

10696.239 --> 10703.08
o yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean the

10700.76 --> 10706.56
Horizon the heart is the Horizon of the

10703.08 --> 10709.56
spirit is a nice thing to say it sounds

10706.56 --> 10712.039999999999
nice it's intuitive but I mean the

10709.56 --> 10717.239
function of inability to handle the

10712.04 --> 10717.239000000001
truth now that's some acet gravy right

10717.76 --> 10723.0
there and it is because everybody knows

10721.08 --> 10724.96
the saying you can't hand the truth and

10723.0 --> 10728.52
then they're like oh humanity is so

10724.96 --> 10730.399
stupid is it though or is there very

10728.52 --> 10733.2
good reason why people can't handle the

10730.399 --> 10736.119999999999
truth does it

10733.2 --> 10739.6
elucidate how people's Consciousness

10736.12 --> 10739.6
builds up

10768.92 --> 10774.6
bit of a goof yeah don't listen to Moxy

10772.12 --> 10777.640000000001
there he is mostly a bit of a

10774.6 --> 10779.880000000001
goof I think everybody else here takes

10777.64 --> 10783.64
everything rather serious because indeed

10779.88 --> 10786.56
it is a workshop and when I get inspired

10783.64 --> 10788.88
I expect not everybody to just make

10786.56 --> 10791.399
goofy statements to try to distract away

10788.88 --> 10793.8
from the higher frequency

10791.399 --> 10798.599999999999
understanding right even though you

10793.8 --> 10798.599999999999
might not be able to handle the truth

10837.72 --> 10841.679999999998
you love the truth you live for it

10839.52 --> 10846.12
except for the Earth not being a globe

10841.68 --> 10846.12
though you don't love that truth

10855.68 --> 10863.16
yeah you love the truth that you're

10857.8 --> 10863.16
ready to accept as does everybody else

10882.64 --> 10888.199999999999
just yeah whatever Moxy yeah you're not

10885.2 --> 10890.52
going to ruin my show for me I know you

10888.2 --> 10893.04
have this

10890.52 --> 10897.439
Talent I'm not going to let it like

10893.04 --> 10901.439
today's been way too heavy gravy for you

10897.439 --> 10901.439
to ruin anything

10908.88 --> 10913.679999999998
yeah I don't care I don't I really don't

10924.08 --> 10929.439
Moxy

10926.399 --> 10932.0
yeah I mean everybody loves the truth

10929.439 --> 10934.0
lives for the truth unless that truth is

10932.0 --> 10936.8
something that you disagree

10934.0 --> 10938.6
with or something you can't handle and

10936.8 --> 10941.16
then you don't love it

10938.6 --> 10943.92
or or maybe you're at the point where

10941.16 --> 10946.52
well then I'm not going to call it truth

10943.92 --> 10949.0
well then the truth isn't the truth

10946.52 --> 10952.279
truth is either the truth

10949.0 --> 10954.56
or if it's inconvenient and thereby you

10952.279 --> 10957.479000000001
declare it not the truth well then it

10954.56 --> 10961.68
never was anything that you were

10957.479 --> 10961.679999999998
perceiving was the truth in the first

10962.96 --> 10969.0
instance cuz among the truth is always

10966.96 --> 10973.72
things that are in

10969.0 --> 10977.56
convenient yeah most truth is very

10973.72 --> 10980.039999999999
inconvenient in convenient to your

10977.56 --> 10982.96
Consciousness which requires a very

10980.04 --> 10985.76
specific level of understanding a

10982.96 --> 10990.08
certain vantage point that you build

10985.76 --> 10992.239
upon yeah and then all this truth will

10990.08 --> 10995.0
disrupt that vantage point it will show

10992.239 --> 10997.359
the potholes on your

10995.0 --> 11000.239
platform that you don't want to accept

10997.359 --> 11000.239
because you to keep

11005.16 --> 11009.96
building yeah yeah yeah keep telling

11007.56 --> 11012.76
yourself that Moxy keep telling yourself

11009.96 --> 11016.0
that like nobody's buying that not even

11012.76 --> 11018.6
you is actually buying that you're just

11016.0 --> 11021.88
chanting and you don't even believe

11018.6 --> 11025.640000000001
that and nobody cares whether you do or

11021.88 --> 11025.64
Not by the way

11030.239 --> 11033.8
all right anyway I'm going to take a

11031.479 --> 11036.08
two-minute break and then probably round

11033.8 --> 11036.08
out the

11056.72 --> 11059.72
show

11086.64 --> 11089.64
e

11116.64 --> 11120.68
e for

11172.64 --> 11176.08
and I'm back

11192.56 --> 11194.88
you're

11198.16 --> 11201.96
automatic enjoying the

11203.0 --> 11207.0
ride okay

11211.8 --> 11218.278999999999
yeah well hey automatic is cool right

11214.479 --> 11220.72
you enjoy the ride until you

11218.279 --> 11222.84
don't what are you going to do then you

11220.72 --> 11226.72
still going to take the ride even when

11222.84 --> 11226.72
there's no joy in it

11249.6 --> 11252.880000000001
all right

11257.42 --> 11263.39
[Applause]

11262.32 --> 11270.279999999999
[Music]

11263.39 --> 11270.279999999999
[Applause]

11275.66 --> 11278.739
[Music]

11284.16 --> 11287.16
um

11311.279 --> 11315.239
right so yeah hope you've all been

11313.08 --> 11319.68
enjoying the show don't forget to rogans

11315.239 --> 11322.72
it up and share it and please

11319.68 --> 11325.68
somebody support

11322.72 --> 11329.438999999998
me could really use the support I've

11325.68 --> 11329.439
been asking for like a week

11331.0 --> 11334.92
weak it's getting kind of

11336.88 --> 11341.679999999998
tough what am I saying it has been a

11354.8 --> 11361.72
week I'd really love to see some support

11358.08 --> 11364.239
again I mean especially Today's show was

11361.72 --> 11364.239
just

11365.16 --> 11370.72
like very happy about it like this is

11367.84 --> 11374.359
exactly what I do this is exactly what I

11370.72 --> 11378.119999999999
intend to do like esoteric

11374.359 --> 11382.12
structures that apply to everything to

11378.12 --> 11384.399000000001
like all Fields like this is what Jesus

11382.12 --> 11387.76
Christ arguably

11384.399 --> 11389.96
did not saying that I am Jesus Christ or

11387.76 --> 11393.399
whatever it's just I try to follow the

11389.96 --> 11396.96
methodology and whatever I do whatever I

11393.399 --> 11400.16
try to Enlighten people about I'm going

11396.96 --> 11403.72
to try to do it in a way that it applies

11400.16 --> 11403.72
to all

11405.88 --> 11413.8
things and I think I did so very well

11409.92 --> 11415.92
today with very important things and I'm

11413.8 --> 11418.88
also very happy that I'm just getting

11415.92 --> 11420.8
more profound with

11418.88 --> 11424.119999999999
these statements about aberration and

11420.8 --> 11426.84
the ethers like yeah it's not a unified

11424.12 --> 11430.12
thing it isn't it doesn't mean that

11426.84 --> 11431.399
there aren't these things there they're

11430.12 --> 11434.08
there they're

11431.399 --> 11438.08
magnificent but it doesn't mean that

11434.08 --> 11439.399
it's all one thing unification theorists

11438.08 --> 11443.12
ruin

11439.399 --> 11444.84
everything and every damn time they pop

11443.12 --> 11448.68
up in

11444.84 --> 11450.880000000001
history and they try to unify something

11448.68 --> 11456.52
what happens every single time they've

11450.88 --> 11459.16
tried that it messes up it messes up

11456.52 --> 11462.52
everything people all like oh we found

11459.16 --> 11467.56
it oh and then it all goes

11462.52 --> 11472.479000000001
wrong yeah every damn

11467.56 --> 11474.92
time unification theorist try to involve

11472.479 --> 11477.96
themselves they create

11474.92 --> 11482.399
aberration send people into the weed s

11477.96 --> 11482.399
and then everything fails and falls

11489.08 --> 11493.52
apart that's one of the bigger lessons

11491.479 --> 11495.72
that is to be learned about just like

11493.52 --> 11497.560000000001
how to deal with the akashic record how

11495.72 --> 11499.96
to deal with information

11497.56 --> 11503.88
itself yeah you're going to have to deal

11499.96 --> 11508.278999999999
with tons and tons of separate

11503.88 --> 11512.519999999999
things a big wide overview view

11508.279 --> 11515.479000000001
of vast amounts of completely separate

11512.52 --> 11519.12
things like a thousand things that are

11515.479 --> 11522.92
just parallel to each other and that

11519.12 --> 11526.160000000002
cannot be unified you can't unify it it

11522.92 --> 11526.16
is against

11526.239 --> 11530.52
nature you want to unify it to

11528.96 --> 11532.599999999999
oversimplify because if it's

11530.52 --> 11535.479000000001
oversimplified then you can have a

11532.6 --> 11538.640000000001
better oversight easier oversight you

11535.479 --> 11543.278999999999
can have an oversight with less wisd

11538.64 --> 11543.278999999999
guess what it doesn't

11543.72 --> 11552.119999999999
work cuz they're not unified and you

11547.76 --> 11552.12
really do need the

11552.319 --> 11559.16
wisdom of all the separate things in

11556.319 --> 11561.479
order to understand the whole that

11559.16 --> 11567.84
cannot be

11561.479 --> 11567.84
defined it can only be known and felt

11568.76 --> 11576.56
and expressed in reflection to an

11571.76 --> 11576.56
inquiry or a piece of information or a

11577.0 --> 11582.84
saying you

11579.0 --> 11584.96
cannot formulate the whole unification

11582.84 --> 11587.359
theory is always going to be a dead end

11584.96 --> 11590.72
it is luciferian by nature it is

11587.359 --> 11592.960000000001
arrogant unification theory theorizing

11590.72 --> 11592.96
is

11593.16 --> 11598.52
arrogant it suggests that you can

11597.279 --> 11602.08
define

11598.52 --> 11602.08
wisdom into

11603.16 --> 11608.96
structure so that those that do not have

11606.279 --> 11611.52
the wisdom will attain the wisdom

11608.96 --> 11613.319
through the structure when they don't

11611.52 --> 11614.439
and it never ends up there it always

11613.319 --> 11617.278999999999
ends up

11614.439 --> 11621.16
wrong and

11617.279 --> 11624.04
misled because there is no

11621.16 --> 11627.479
unification it's a collection of

11624.04 --> 11631.52
separate pieces of wisdom that you have

11627.479 --> 11634.438999999998
to collect over your lifetime and

11631.52 --> 11637.08
understand and then compare it all on an

11634.439 --> 11641.2
equal level and

11637.08 --> 11645.439
not reduce all that wisdom to try to

11641.2 --> 11648.68
make it into a single pattern

11645.439 --> 11654.960000000001
literally which it

11648.68 --> 11654.960000000001
isn't unification Theory leads to a dead

11655.16 --> 11659.039999999999
end every time

11682.239 --> 11686.08
right anyhow I think with that since you

11684.52 --> 11689.04
guys aren't really responding to what

11686.08 --> 11692.08
I'm talking about anymore just going

11689.04 --> 11692.080000000002
amongst yourself

11692.68 --> 11698.52
now

11694.279 --> 11698.52
whatever I'm just going to round out

11698.8 --> 11705.278999999999
then because I think that the threshold

11701.76 --> 11707.04
of you being able to handle the level of

11705.279 --> 11709.84
information that I'm presenting has

11707.04 --> 11713.399000000001
already been surpassed for a while

11709.84 --> 11716.479
now right luckily you're not the only

11713.399 --> 11719.119999999999
ones that actually listen to me or not

11716.479 --> 11721.76
listen to me are in my presence while I

11719.12 --> 11724.279
roll out this insight and then not get a

11721.76 --> 11726.359
direct response from you but instead a

11724.279 --> 11728.0
very distracted back and forth that

11726.359 --> 11729.12
doesn't involve what I'm directly

11728.0 --> 11732.239
talking

11729.12 --> 11734.800000000001
about because you can't handle the truth

11732.239 --> 11734.8
not at this

11736.6 --> 11742.239
point you're out that's fine Shana you

11740.359 --> 11744.640000000001
can go wherever you like it it's been

11742.239 --> 11748.56
interesting having you here

11744.64 --> 11751.64
and I hope

11748.56 --> 11754.0
it was inspiring in some way and I do

11751.64 --> 11756.479
also hope that it didn't rub you the

11754.0 --> 11760.319
wrong way although some of it probably

11756.479 --> 11762.64
will because the truth when it's real is

11760.319 --> 11765.119999999999
very

11762.64 --> 11767.76
confronting and it will always present

11765.12 --> 11770.199
you with things that are inconvenient to

11767.76 --> 11773.279
you from your conscious vantage point

11770.199 --> 11778.319000000001
because that's just the nature of

11773.279 --> 11780.479000000001
it like the real the absolute truth or

11778.319 --> 11783.519999999999
the preponderance of

11780.479 --> 11785.64
Truth basically never allows you any

11783.52 --> 11789.76
Solid

11785.64 --> 11794.72
Ground CU there's always more there's

11789.76 --> 11794.72
like there's always a higher place to

11794.96 --> 11802.039999999999
stand so by that sense like the truth is

11798.92 --> 11807.0
literally inconvenient for the

11802.04 --> 11809.359
Consciousness if it's too wide too big

11807.0 --> 11811.72
didn't rub me wrong okay that's

11809.359 --> 11815.08
cool I'm glad to hear

11811.72 --> 11818.319
that it's good to to have you here in

11815.08 --> 11820.96
the chat some of

11818.319 --> 11824.56
you it's better than a bunch of anti

11820.96 --> 11829.759999999998
Flat Earth bickering and all

11824.56 --> 11829.76
that right anyhow I'm rounding

11830.359 --> 11835.880000000001
out so thanks everyone for coming I hope

11833.72 --> 11838.84
you like this show if you did then

11835.88 --> 11841.039999999999
please don't forget to Rogan's it up or

11838.84 --> 11842.8
pinky it up at this

11841.04 --> 11846.160000000002
point I

11842.8 --> 11848.88
me Rogan is

11846.16 --> 11850.76
really about that Terren guy if he

11848.88 --> 11853.16
really fell for that

11850.76 --> 11856.439
that's yeah you don't deserve to be even

11853.16 --> 11859.8
call the thumb you're just a pinky

11856.439 --> 11863.68
now but I'm not going to say pinky it up

11859.8 --> 11865.72
that's just annoying and a little gay so

11863.68 --> 11868.84
it's just going to be thumb it up Rogan

11865.72 --> 11868.84

11870.96 --> 11874.64

donation I think that today show alone

11898.04 --> 11903.279
warrants some support for this level of

11901.68 --> 11906.52
esoteric
