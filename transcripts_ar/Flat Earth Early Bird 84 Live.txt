3.62 --> 12.599
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

8.01 --> 23.810000000000002
early-bird number 84 I'm your host

12.599 --> 28.05
Arwen and again cold cold day and yeah I

23.81 --> 30.538999999999998
don't know if I look much better but I

28.05 --> 34.559
do feel a lot better I actually managed

30.539 --> 38.969
to go to sleep yesterday night's still

34.559 --> 41.79
late but not too late and I've noticed

38.969 --> 44.57
such a massive difference when I woke up

41.79 --> 44.57
this morning

46.69 --> 52.51
and it's kind of weird because yeah been

50.41 --> 56.739
saying it for in the days even when

52.51 --> 58.42
before it's like a face and I'm climbing

56.739 --> 61.269999999999996
out of the hill but I seem to have been

58.42 --> 62.559000000000005
climbing pretty quickly now so I feel so

61.27 --> 65.29
much better already

62.559 --> 70.96
it's not over yet because there's

65.29 --> 75.07000000000001
something there's something else there's

70.96 --> 79.53999999999999
a confrontation that's happened because

75.07 --> 83.03999999999999
of what I did and I'm still trying to

79.54 --> 83.04
puzzle what to do with this

92.35 --> 102.61
I think getting some really freaky

95.64 --> 107.47
comments such people that were

102.61 --> 110.95
apparently very burned burned touched in

107.47 --> 115.06
a way that they could not handle for

110.95 --> 118.78
what I did flat earther leeward 82 from

115.06 --> 125.92
some perspective it is obvious it's just

118.78 --> 129.25
pure hatred which comes from probably

125.92 --> 132.19
having the exact same sensation but

129.25 --> 136.0
having totally surrendered to the

132.19 --> 138.97
enslavement of it and it'll just be a

136.0 --> 141.7
demonic reversed world response and with

138.97 --> 144.73
others it's more like oh you can't do

141.7 --> 149.01899999999998
this oh oh no that's irresponsible and

144.73 --> 152.41
oh like oh yeah I totally agree with you

149.019 --> 159.959
but you can't do this I actually did

152.41 --> 159.959
this Dutch woman she looks like a freak

160.34 --> 168.41
and she made a video and actually had

163.52 --> 172.13
the gall the gall to try to blackmail me

168.41 --> 175.01
like yeah I'm gonna left this out there

172.13 --> 177.2
and I'm gonna show all the most darkest

175.01 --> 180.56
moments completely out of context and

177.2 --> 186.7
even say like I don't know what this is

180.56 --> 194.9
about but he's dangerous right

186.7 --> 198.04899999999998
it's a vile evil and I will not take it

194.9 --> 201.83
down and you're gonna have to go as far

198.049 --> 203.48000000000002
as to make that video repeat it over and

201.83 --> 206.09
over again put it on the mainstream

203.48 --> 208.88
media put a worldwide alert that there

206.09 --> 210.739
is a homicidal maniac called our wind

208.88 --> 213.17
that hate speedos and he must be

210.739 --> 215.54
controlled quickly lobotomize said we

213.17 --> 218.17999999999998
can't stand that there's somebody out

215.54 --> 220.15
there that actually has real rage about

218.18 --> 222.47
a real issue that the entire world

220.15 --> 227.65
suffers from my god

222.47 --> 231.489
can't be never never

227.65 --> 231.489
I'm ready

233.599 --> 249.439
that was real and I will not apologize

237.65 --> 252.859
for it and hey the retrospect it's so

249.439 --> 255.769
lovely because everyone that's attacking

252.859 --> 257.93
me you are on this issue it's not even

255.769 --> 262.849
that many people but it is very vile

257.93 --> 265.13
it's a new things that people that never

262.849 --> 270.74
talk to me never reached out they

265.13 --> 274.15999999999997
certainly like the Crawleys are starting

270.74 --> 276.08
to move now that I took their rock away

274.16 --> 282.47
from them they're exposed and they're

276.08 --> 284.50899999999996
crawling in there yes singing even in in

282.47 --> 289.37
the entire context of it and everything

284.509 --> 295.61
I explained like no it is a rage inside

289.37 --> 299.0
its panic and it's natural but I don't

295.61 --> 303.65000000000003
do that I am NOT couldn't literally hurt

299.0 --> 305.72
a fly okay even said like yeah it's it's

303.65 --> 306.849
just a rage it's a berserk enrage and

305.72 --> 309.65000000000003
that is it

306.849 --> 314.419
it's nothing rational to it there's no

309.65 --> 316.87
plan to it it is just wrong and that is

314.419 --> 316.87
what it was

325.97 --> 336.53000000000003
yeah and look I get it I get why

331.15 --> 340.09
everyone would be making fun of it a fun

336.53 --> 344.45
of being sensitive to this [ __ ] because

340.09 --> 350.98999999999995
yeah we are being bombarded from all

344.45 --> 354.02
sides with cultural cultural adjustments

350.99 --> 357.95
basically trying to get us used to this

354.02 --> 361.52
[ __ ] so everybody knows everybody will

357.95 --> 364.09999999999997
know and we'll have it shoved in their

361.52 --> 367.88
faces like yeah Peters control the world

364.1 --> 371.66
and they're [ __ ] your children to

367.88 --> 379.19
make you get used to it and accept it

371.66 --> 382.16
right so yeah what are you gonna do with

379.19 --> 385.28
that are you gonna let yourself go

382.16 --> 387.08000000000004
berserk or are you gonna make a joke

385.28 --> 391.47999999999996
about it because then what the hell else

387.08 --> 394.52
can you do you know it's a tight

391.48 --> 397.66900000000004
psychological warfare scenario here and

394.52 --> 400.15
everyone is involved whether you like it

397.669 --> 400.15
or not

403.74 --> 414.16
so enough about that [ __ ] it's probably

408.04 --> 416.20000000000005
gonna be haunting me for months maybe

414.16 --> 418.65000000000003
it's gonna maybe it's gonna end this

416.2 --> 423.01
maybe it's just never gonna go away ever

418.65 --> 428.03999999999996
it's like oh my god how how dare is some

423.01 --> 432.88
individual just someone express raw

428.04 --> 434.86
hatred over a legitimate thing how can

432.88 --> 437.77
that happen in this world it's not

434.86 --> 440.11
allowed we're not we're not allowed to

437.77 --> 448.45
have emotions we're not allowed to have

440.11 --> 450.52000000000004
a need for for justice this world what

448.45 --> 452.96999999999997
they what they're trying to make you

450.52 --> 452.96999999999997
into

455.06 --> 457.66
so

458.95 --> 464.11
I am doing better I hope you can sense

461.83 --> 467.56
it I can help you can sense it from my

464.11 --> 469.78000000000003
voice my voice which may sound a little

467.56 --> 472.75
bit low volume at the moment because I

469.78 --> 476.34999999999997
again forgot to put up the volume in

472.75 --> 482.59
there I know it's okay this should be

476.35 --> 488.59000000000003
better anyway I am open for guests there

482.59 --> 491.44
was a guy that commented think and I

488.59 --> 493.35999999999996
sent him an email with the Hangout lake

491.44 --> 504.1
so maybe he'll show up that will be

493.36 --> 506.83000000000004
interesting right and yeah if nobody

504.1 --> 512.44
else is gonna join me then it will again

506.83 --> 515.29
be you know you know who's gonna come in

512.44 --> 517.57

515.29 --> 522.4
yeah you flat earthers are gonna get in

517.57 --> 525.46
here and do a show with me then it's

522.4 --> 533.97

537.22 --> 541.0500000000001
you're not getting in here

546.14 --> 553.89
I'm just saying I don't know why all of

550.44 --> 557.7
you always not always just all the rare

553.89 --> 558.72
occasions seem to want to join me and I

557.7 --> 562.58
don't get it

558.72 --> 562.58
am i that intolerable

566.96 --> 572.24
and that hard to deal with like Oh

570.11 --> 575.779
somebody needs to take care of our wind

572.24 --> 579.64
will you do it will you be beside him

575.779 --> 579.64
because just just too much

585.6 --> 592.91
just so you know I am doing

588.529 --> 595.86
significantly better it's not over yet

592.91 --> 598.529
still the echoes but I'm not shaking

595.86 --> 604.5500000000001
anymore at least it's not shaking from

598.529 --> 610.47
these sensations thanks thanks a lot

604.55 --> 613.68
creator for fulfilling that promise that

610.47 --> 616.85
I saw that it would get better and that

613.68 --> 618.7399999999999
I trusted it and that I reached out

616.85 --> 622.11
prayed to Christ

618.74 --> 625.0790000000001
very seriously very deeply before I went

622.11 --> 631.259
to bed spoke out loud not just whispered

625.079 --> 634.4399999999999
spoke out loud because I I tend to not

631.259 --> 639.2090000000001
do that I don't know why tend to be

634.44 --> 642.839
timid it and it's better if you say it

639.209 --> 646.649
with strength these things if you let

642.839 --> 650.5690000000001
that frequency envelop you and not just

646.649 --> 657.68
whisper it not just in the mind but just

650.569 --> 657.68
let the sound of it go through you

660.54 --> 668.89
and it worked because I woke up amazing

664.44 --> 670.86
like so much stronger and so much more

668.89 --> 674.77
stable it is also kind of weird that

670.86 --> 681.76
yesterday apparently I I read I didn't

674.77 --> 683.92
eat almost anything it was weird and it

681.76 --> 685.93
I think it was like a fasting if maybe

683.92 --> 687.7299999999999
that is kind of what I would intuitively

685.93 --> 690.0999999999999
did to get through this

687.73 --> 693.16
it helped I fast I just didn't want to

690.1 --> 698.0500000000001
eat I had a bunch of chocolate peanuts

693.16 --> 700.899
and some what is it some certain type of

698.05 --> 702.9399999999999
chips just a small bag that's it and

700.899 --> 705.72
that's throughout the entire day and

702.94 --> 709.3900000000001
just didn't want anything else oh wait a

705.72 --> 713.7090000000001
lot of tea I had like four pots of tea

709.39 --> 719.01
in the entire day but that's it no food

713.709 --> 719.01
and barely and it's better now

722.03 --> 730.6899999999999
so yeah I am climbing out of this and

725.14 --> 734.42
let's see if I can go back to being the

730.69 --> 737.5300000000001
regular Arwen and not just that one

734.42 --> 737.53
thing that happened

744.19 --> 754.6
yeah brain is telling us we're getting

746.92 --> 756.67
fat that's interesting ute I think it is

754.6 --> 760.029
a metabolic or process it's a metabolic

756.67 --> 764.019
process like even this depression thing

760.029 --> 767.98
is very much it feels exactly like a

764.019 --> 770.889
metabolic process like a hormonal reset

767.98 --> 775.269
and that's why it's out of whack because

770.889 --> 778.75
yeah you can't function and repair at

775.269 --> 782.29
the same time so maybe that is what that

778.75 --> 784.959
is and the fasting is just a cleansing

782.29 --> 787.48
wave just like okay now it's the

784.959 --> 791.1099999999999
intestines turn they need to be at a

787.48 --> 796.66
minimum to get that part fixed because

791.11 --> 801.4300000000001
yeah a lot of pressure a lot of tension

796.66 --> 803.56
bear though no nothing that's I was so

801.43 --> 806.5889999999999
surprised like there's too much

803.56 --> 809.8
information this I get but no diarrhea

806.589 --> 815.35
and when I'm that tense I usually do and

809.8 --> 817.62
like no it was so like what's going on

815.35 --> 817.62
this

818.61 --> 825.51
I guess it's good but it it's weird

822.899 --> 827.58
because I'm used to like when I'm over

825.51 --> 832.67
Pence and [ __ ] going all wrong then

827.58 --> 836.82
typically that does happen you know so I

832.67 --> 840.05
guess I got to heal pretty well and I

836.82 --> 840.0500000000001
just feel a lot better today

851.459 --> 854.459
so

854.59 --> 862.5400000000001
but yep I did contract a couple of

858.31 --> 867.76
really nasty trolls now that taking it

862.54 --> 871.18
very personal and that are out to get me

867.76 --> 874.3
and I'm not talking about ballers just

871.18 --> 876.37
doing their thing no some nasty

874.3 --> 878.4
individuals now and I will deal with

876.37 --> 884.1
them one way or the other

878.4 --> 887.9399999999999
nothing radical nothing bloody I will

884.1 --> 887.94
deal with you

893.53 --> 898.18
and I'm not gonna apologize

904.93 --> 911.27
and that's the funny thing

908.12 --> 916.3
it doesn't make any sense really is is

911.27 --> 919.22
everything really as it is because I I

916.3 --> 923.2299999999999
did something pretty extreme

919.22 --> 927.01
you know and I haven't got a flag

923.23 --> 934.76
notification a warning strike nothing

927.01 --> 937.49
and I don't know I think that I can damn

934.76 --> 940.52
well imagine that people would at least

937.49 --> 944.39
try to do it there's a special flag on

940.52 --> 946.97
the top of the list violence yeah well

944.39 --> 950.65
it was freakin violent it was a violent

946.97 --> 954.07
outrage a berserk yeah it's what it was

950.65 --> 954.0699999999999
but I didn't

956.579 --> 962.5699999999999
it's

959.21 --> 964.46
it's so complicated like if you really

962.57 --> 966.98
go to the core of it it was just a panic

964.46 --> 973.2800000000001
attack basically a panic attacks are

966.98 --> 977.1800000000001
expressed in a rage and it's no secret

973.28 --> 978.8
wizard plan to get that done no that's

977.18 --> 982.37
the thing about it if you throw it out

978.8 --> 986.15
in the open it's not a secret thing it's

982.37 --> 988.79
not wizardry as days some are starting

986.15 --> 995.29
to call that it's not a deception it's

988.79 --> 998.66
not Mesmer it's just raw open real part

995.29 --> 1001.05
that's kind of inconvenient to a lot of

998.66 --> 1001.05
people

1005.44 --> 1009.69
that's what it is anyway

1014.17 --> 1018.7299999999999
yeah yeah then wouldn't feel I think I

1016.36 --> 1025.839
went a little further than Alex Jones

1018.73 --> 1030.81
probably ever has but yeah I I don't

1025.839 --> 1030.81
really have much to lose in that sense

1044.73 --> 1047.63
what the [ __ ]

1051.85 --> 1056.9099999999999
that's that is absolutely maniacal

1067.36 --> 1074.8899999999999
get it have touched soy

1071.39 --> 1074.89
such a long time

1077.41 --> 1083.6200000000001
and even in the earlier times when it

1081.22 --> 1086.38
was kind of like getting on nobody knew

1083.62 --> 1088.4399999999998
really anything about it I just thought

1086.38 --> 1091.75
I was be disgusting I didn't like it

1088.44 --> 1095.8600000000001
felt wrong it felt bad I I always

1091.75 --> 1101.5
avoided it naturally and now I avoid it

1095.86 --> 1104.6999999999998
meticulously so no there's no soy in

1101.5 --> 1104.7
this guy you know

1105.59 --> 1108.6399999999999
good luck with that

1123.04 --> 1131.6599999999999
okay let's see what Alan B comes up with

1126.02 --> 1136.27
me to make me look like a madman and

1131.66 --> 1136.27
carry this part anymore I just

1139.92 --> 1145.559
I do kind of want to get back to just a

1142.44 --> 1152.5800000000002
regular boring show you could call it or

1145.559 --> 1154.5
something that you know you can't hold

1152.58 --> 1156.6899999999998
on to that one freaking moment all the

1154.5 --> 1159.69
time I can't let it become kind of an

1156.69 --> 1163.5
obsession at least to me and yeah it did

1159.69 --> 1169.22
echo back to my face again it unnerves

1163.5 --> 1173.76
me that I that that was out in the open

1169.22 --> 1177.63
that's part of it it's it's just what I

1173.76 --> 1179.96
had to do I had to do it inside I don't

1177.63 --> 1179.96
know why

1183.17 --> 1188.51
Lu good morning are when the hell are

1185.93 --> 1194.0600000000002
you today much better thank you

1188.51 --> 1199.27
that's good that's good what's been

1194.06 --> 1199.27
happening what hasn't been happening

1202.57 --> 1206.1799999999998
I've got some questions these might

1204.74 --> 1211.79
upset you I don't know

1206.18 --> 1215.95
sure this is you kind of like third

1211.79 --> 1219.62
outburst as people would say how do you

1215.95 --> 1223.43
deal with people saying that it's fake

1219.62 --> 1226.7299999999998
this Alec Jones style acting that's very

1223.43 --> 1229.67
simple I explain why they don't get it

1226.73 --> 1233.15
because they're sociopaths that have no

1229.67 --> 1236.72
sense for what is going on so they don't

1233.15 --> 1239.18
see it psychopaths are even worse they

1236.72 --> 1241.76
just don't have any feelings at all and

1239.18 --> 1244.3700000000001
it's all just a game feelings are like a

1241.76 --> 1246.77
game to them and the sociopaths they

1244.37 --> 1248.6899999999998
just don't they miss that sense it's

1246.77 --> 1251.54
like it's been lobotomized from their

1248.69 --> 1258.23
empathy so they just don't see it and

1251.54 --> 1261.73
then they can only speculate so the

1258.23 --> 1264.26
people they're the same that you'd

1261.73 --> 1269.66
conjured this open we're doing it for

1264.26 --> 1272.69
clicks right or wrong no really is that

1269.66 --> 1275.03
the step why I'm doing it I don't know

1272.69 --> 1278.66
I'm just a thanks look if I wanted

1275.03 --> 1281.42
clicks then I'd just be a total insane

1278.66 --> 1285.71
clown constantly I would never have

1281.42 --> 1288.3200000000002
shown my face and just be a a freaking

1285.71 --> 1290.81
wizard to the max basically and in the

1288.32 --> 1295.6699999999998
but in a bad way and just that's how you

1290.81 --> 1301.25
get clicks please I'm just trying to be

1295.67 --> 1303.52
me here okay okay I'm just asking um one

1301.25 --> 1303.52
of the things

1305.33 --> 1312.48
well you will having arranged this week

1308.46 --> 1315.749
that troubled me I could see you were in

1312.48 --> 1320.279
trouble so I asked a few people to

1315.749 --> 1322.98
contact you to help people who are in

1320.279 --> 1326.269
your community because I knew you I know

1322.98 --> 1333.2
you probably wouldn't listen to me so

1326.269 --> 1333.2
and a few of those Arwen said no and

1333.259 --> 1339.929
that's that surprised me because you

1336.809 --> 1342.6
know flat-earthers talked a lot about

1339.929 --> 1345.8690000000001
community and being together and it said

1342.6 --> 1348.11
to me everyone has their own limits okay

1345.869 --> 1351.899
not everyone can always deal with

1348.11 --> 1354.9599999999998
everything when it arrives and I don't

1351.899 --> 1357.809
expect them to I don't demand that if I

1354.96 --> 1359.97
get outraged like some social justice

1357.809 --> 1365.58
warrior that people just like oh now you

1359.97 --> 1367.559
must do this you must know no but some

1365.58 --> 1373.1689999999999
of these people were taught to be a

1367.559 --> 1375.57
friend I don't care okay

1373.169 --> 1378.8600000000001
okay I'm just asking questions is ill

1375.57 --> 1384.1789999999999
shoulder like if if they can't handle it

1378.86 --> 1387.1789999999999
then they can't handle it walk away and

1384.179 --> 1388.95
I guess my final question is constants

1387.179 --> 1391.679
offered you some advice yesterday and I

1388.95 --> 1395.429
know you find a lot of comfort in what

1391.679 --> 1397.97
she says yes but in my opinion I think

1395.429 --> 1402.24
she offered you some really bad advice

1397.97 --> 1404.549
yeah I think I think it's worth talking

1402.24 --> 1407.97
to professionals I think it's worth

1404.549 --> 1413.61
talking to people who do this for a

1407.97 --> 1417.24
living he already have you I'm almost 40

1413.61 --> 1419.129
years old man since I was 5 you think I

1417.24 --> 1423.09
haven't talked about do this about with

1419.129 --> 1427.019
professionals Jesus I went to

1423.09 --> 1430.58
professionals at 5 okay it's the same

1427.019 --> 1430.58
[ __ ] it's always the same [ __ ]

1432.68 --> 1439.76
they can't help you don't think so yeah

1436.49 --> 1443.45
I know you know the only thing they have

1439.76 --> 1445.49
to offer is just like you just talk that

1443.45 --> 1447.2
helps talks that's really the only thing

1445.49 --> 1451.3
that helps just talk because the

1447.2 --> 1454.25
alternative is just lobotomize yourself

1451.3 --> 1456.74
one way or the other it's always the

1454.25 --> 1461.54
solution isn't it you can get it away

1456.74 --> 1462.92
there must be removed that helps so you

1461.54 --> 1464.87
don't think talking to a professional

1462.92 --> 1468.1100000000001
would help no I already know everything

1464.87 --> 1475.07
about it there is to know I am the

1468.11 --> 1478.4499999999998
professional okay this is what I've been

1475.07 --> 1482.35
learning about my whole damn life and

1478.45 --> 1486.05
I'm sharing that knowledge for others

1482.35 --> 1488.3899999999999
that bump into the same shitty society

1486.05 --> 1491.99
that tells them to lobotomize themselves

1488.39 --> 1495.6200000000001
and I'm giving them an alternative like

1491.99 --> 1499.07
yeah you can handle this you can get

1495.62 --> 1505.3999999999999
something out of this it is there for a

1499.07 --> 1508.96
purpose for you to deal with for the

1505.4 --> 1513.8000000000002
record I think that's really bad advice

1508.96 --> 1517.8400000000001
does your freaking problem really really

1513.8 --> 1521.69
bad advice it's not it is it's not

1517.84 --> 1522.8899999999999
listen if you fly off the switch that's

1521.69 --> 1525.94
something that you've been thinking

1522.89 --> 1528.3200000000002
about overnight by watching a video and

1525.94 --> 1532.13
display the rage that you displayed

1528.32 --> 1534.29
while requesting people be killed and

1532.13 --> 1538.4
murdered you've got a bit of a problem

1534.29 --> 1540.32
my friend I was in a panic I just

1538.4 --> 1542.71
couldn't handle that the world was the

1540.32 --> 1547.1599999999999
way it was and that's the result of it

1542.71 --> 1550.13
it was the truth but you were requesting

1547.16 --> 1554.69
people be murdered oh I was asking for

1550.13 --> 1557.24
help to God you could say it's like help

1554.69 --> 1559.7
please this can't go on why does this

1557.24 --> 1565.31
keep on happening

1559.7 --> 1568.73
yeah you can and I'm not telling anyone

1565.31 --> 1571.04
to do it I'm just saying like I can't

1568.73 --> 1573.17
handle this [ __ ] that is what it was I'm

1571.04 --> 1577.6399999999999
not asking to do anything

1573.17 --> 1578.48
did I address anyone he told people to

1577.64 --> 1587.0
kill them all

1578.48 --> 1590.99
yeah in a massive few cuz what else just

1587.0 --> 1593.96
let it all be just you know yeah job

1590.99 --> 1595.61
sacrifice all that [ __ ] just yeah what

1593.96 --> 1600.3400000000001
we've been doing as her thousands of

1595.61 --> 1600.34
years like who needs a soul you know

1602.42 --> 1608.4
No

1604.45 --> 1608.4
the ship needs to stop and

1610.34 --> 1618.77
it's not letting itself be stopped in a

1613.82 --> 1622.55
normal way I don't know what else did it

1618.77 --> 1625.82
was like hey I'm not a strategist in

1622.55 --> 1631.1299999999999
that sense I don't it's just it's an

1625.82 --> 1635.36
expression of helplessness a rage and

1631.13 --> 1638.8400000000001
I'm not asking anyone to do that say

1635.36 --> 1641.27
like you got to do this like oh I was

1638.84 --> 1646.73
just saying like ah I don't know what

1641.27 --> 1651.08
else I'm in a panic and in a rage panic

1646.73 --> 1652.52
that's what that is well I think if you

1651.08 --> 1657.35
go back and you review what you actually

1652.52 --> 1659.81
said yeah I did I did twice no good

1657.35 --> 1662.9299999999998
feeling great me it is because you are

1659.81 --> 1665.9299999999998
now doing the same [ __ ] no I'm asking

1662.93 --> 1667.22
you a reasonable question yeah but

1665.93 --> 1669.77
you're putting words in my mouth

1667.22 --> 1673.0
your wrong intentions there that are not

1669.77 --> 1676.25
there you're suggesting that I did I

1673.0 --> 1678.23
tell people to do that that's what you

1676.25 --> 1679.25
literally started out saying and I

1678.23 --> 1683.48
didn't do that

1679.25 --> 1683.96
Oh Owen - to prove a point Owen to prove

1683.48 --> 1686.45
a point

1683.96 --> 1690.98
look at look at the comments now in text

1686.45 --> 1694.01
oh wow from this means you're right

1690.98 --> 1695.42
because some people got triggered right

1694.01 --> 1698.45
but some people got triggered couldn't

1695.42 --> 1700.76
handle that intensity so yeah maybe some

1698.45 --> 1707.03
of the comments are right and listen to

1700.76 --> 1708.95
me because I'm the warm one of the only

1707.03 --> 1712.7
people that asked other people to get

1708.95 --> 1715.22
you help and they they wouldn't even

1712.7 --> 1720.71
consider it so look what's happening in

1715.22 --> 1727.4
text with chillies eel arrow is accusing

1720.71 --> 1731.3600000000001
me of being a pedophile are you know if

1727.4 --> 1734.96

1731.36 --> 1737.54

1734.96 --> 1740.69
care to yourself and you have a duty of

1737.54 --> 1743.03

I didn't say that I wish I would have

1766.67 --> 1772.94
done it okay that might be your little

to pretend to myself and the world there

2137.75 --> 2142.15
is something in me that doesn't exist

2144.65 --> 2152.15
because that is a burden having that

2147.95 --> 2155.96
rage and I've always been so tolerant

2152.15 --> 2159.5
like everything every settler ins is one

2155.96 --> 2161.6
part of my methodology but this is just

2159.5 --> 2163.7
some things that can't be handled and

2161.6 --> 2166.04
when the pressure goes up from all sides

2163.7 --> 2169.25
in the entire world and there's no

2166.04 --> 2175.75
escape from that pressure then you just

2169.25 --> 2175.75
snap and that's what happened so yeah

2176.58 --> 2181.37
it was meant to be I don't know what

2178.5 --> 2186.84
else to say

2181.37 --> 2188.46
yeah no you I think you're you get to a

2186.84 --> 2195.4700000000003
point where you're frustrated and it's

2188.46 --> 2196.98
got to come out I think some some people

2195.47 --> 2201.0899999999997
will let it out

2196.98 --> 2203.85
without any sort of limit without any

2201.09 --> 2206.9100000000003
boundaries and some just let it all

2203.85 --> 2211.5
happen with with the with a bit of

2206.91 --> 2218.0
conservatism what it wasn't it had

2211.5 --> 2218.0
nothing to do with that really it

2218.34 --> 2221.7200000000003
I think what it was

2222.5 --> 2229.819
was my response from when I was a little

2226.7 --> 2233.839
kid that I couldn't express and I locked

2229.819 --> 2236.569
it in I think that is what it was really

2233.839 --> 2241.339
that that uncontrollable rage it is the

2236.569 --> 2244.49
rage of the little kid hmm and there was

2241.339 --> 2248.24
no there's no freaking politics I didn't

2244.49 --> 2251.2099999999996
care I don't care I don't care for the

2248.24 --> 2257.66
freaking left-right shitty narratives

2251.21 --> 2260.9900000000002
all that it's just just want to be human

2257.66 --> 2265.5099999999998
I tell ya you've lit it out right okay

2260.99 --> 2268.3289999999997
you vented it right and now that's done

2265.51 --> 2274.88
that's done it's finished

2268.329 --> 2277.13
yeah you just got a you are a way of

2274.88 --> 2279.079
what you said though you have some

2277.13 --> 2287.349
people as some people can take it oh

2279.079 --> 2291.5890000000004
yeah I've already had some like

2287.349 --> 2293.6600000000003
seriously creepy responses yeah I'm just

2291.589 --> 2296.75
um I'm guessing you get a shitload more

2293.66 --> 2300.2
right well nothing like this nothing

2296.75 --> 2302.119
like this like people get really nasty

2300.2 --> 2308.72
you really under your skin

2302.119 --> 2312.8900000000003
this something else mmm true awful true

2308.72 --> 2317.81
evil well if you if you take an

2312.89 --> 2322.0099999999998
outsider's view some of the things you

2317.81 --> 2323.54
said were pretty harsh I'm not I know

2322.01 --> 2324.7700000000004
you were venting and you've wanted to

2323.54 --> 2327.7599999999998
let it out and that was your way of

2324.77 --> 2331.91
doing it but I'm just saying from

2327.76 --> 2335.3900000000003
outside looking in some of those some of

2331.91 --> 2338.44
those words were pretty full-on yeah

2335.39 --> 2344.0299999999997
that's what's called a berserker rage

2338.44 --> 2347.81
yeah it is yeah it was a buzzer King

2344.03 --> 2352.369
rage that thing exactly that thing and I

2347.81 --> 2355.43
have it in me it is in my bloodline it's

2352.369 --> 2358.339
what happens when you push me too far

2355.43 --> 2360.589
and I've had [ __ ] with that as a kid

2358.339 --> 2363.41
because yeah all their kids would push

2360.589 --> 2364.91
try to push me that far I would be so

2363.41 --> 2367.22
tolerant and they keep on pushing me

2364.91 --> 2373.3689999999997
pushing me until some this [ __ ] hit the

2367.22 --> 2374.5389999999998
fan hmm cuz people did their demons they

2373.369 --> 2378.829
can't help it

2374.539 --> 2385.73
they can't help but push that [ __ ] are

2378.829 --> 2391.6090000000004
you happy you go today oh no not

2385.73 --> 2394.76
particularly but I am relieved and at

2391.609 --> 2398.5989999999997
the same time worried it's just the same

2394.76 --> 2401.2990000000004
it's it's another type of burden well

2398.599 --> 2405.079
inside me hidden it's now out there and

2401.299 --> 2409.88
now I have to carry it that way some of

2405.079 --> 2412.7000000000003
us were worrying yeah I know from my

2409.88 --> 2416.21
perspective from my perspective as well

2412.7 --> 2419.1189999999997
okay I'm not lying I'm not blind to what

2416.21 --> 2425.529
I said no I'm not suggesting you are I'm

2419.119 --> 2425.529
just studying you know it's

2426.63 --> 2433.4700000000003
it's not a proud moment for you ladies

2428.88 --> 2438.8
it really it was in a way because I

2433.47 --> 2443.54
broke my own fair I was mortified for

2438.8 --> 2443.54
expressing that mortified

2446.6 --> 2454.64
and I did it I didn't I broke through

2450.17 --> 2459.23
the fair I said no I will not be

2454.64 --> 2463.04
intimidated it's real and I'm gonna show

2459.23 --> 2465.71
it even though that's wrong I'm into

2463.04 --> 2469.2799999999997
yelling me you've got the right to say

2465.71 --> 2471.95
whatever you want to say that's this you

2469.28 --> 2474.1400000000003
know this is society we live in as a

2471.95 --> 2476.81
society we should live in however what

2474.14 --> 2478.58
you say do you have some may have

2476.81 --> 2481.1
repercussions yeah no [ __ ]

2478.58 --> 2483.23
so as long as you're aware of that I

2481.1 --> 2483.77
know I'm not saying stupid I'm not

2483.23 --> 2487.13
saying you're not

2483.77 --> 2489.32
but as long as you got that in mind and

2487.13 --> 2492.11
how are you gonna deal with it I don't

2489.32 --> 2494.6600000000003
know I'll see it all depends on where

2492.11 --> 2497.15
the world's going it might go in a very

2494.66 --> 2500.6
bad place and then yeah this is gonna

2497.15 --> 2503.33
screw me but it's only a matter of you

2500.6 --> 2505.58
know there if this keeps on going it

2503.33 --> 2510.0499999999997
doesn't really matter what you do they

2505.58 --> 2514.49
will destroy you every individual with

2510.05 --> 2515.84
whatever falls outside of the anti-life

2514.49 --> 2519.5499999999997
way of doing things

2515.84 --> 2523.01
anything anything they'll start

2519.55 --> 2526.9700000000003
persecuting people for having protective

2523.01 --> 2532.13
feelings in general that kind of [ __ ] it

2526.97 --> 2537.25
will go there if we let it it will go

2532.13 --> 2541.9900000000002
everywhere everywhere no place to hide

2537.25 --> 2545.93
no place to hide inside you outside you

2541.99 --> 2551.6
they will push it all the way all the

2545.93 --> 2553.79
way beyond your wildest nightmares so it

2551.6 --> 2559.47
doesn't really matter what kind of thing

2553.79 --> 2562.049
you opposed with they're gonna

2559.47 --> 2564.569
take you down with whatever you are and

2562.049 --> 2569.569
that's how they do it and it doesn't

2564.569 --> 2569.569
matter in the end you can't hide

2572.52 --> 2580.52
you can only fight find it stand firm

2581.5 --> 2585.869
expand wake others I don't know

2587.77 --> 2590.91
it is what it is

2595.29 --> 2599.91
well as as long as you're good mind you

2597.9 --> 2603.27
just got to be prepared for the yeah

2599.91 --> 2605.58
pull out my suppose right so what if

2603.27 --> 2607.73
your mind is that fall out I want to

2605.58 --> 2612.93
hear it now

2607.73 --> 2613.95
what in your you tell me no fall out no

2612.93 --> 2617.64
what is it

2613.95 --> 2620.6099999999997
what do you see what is gonna happen was

2617.64 --> 2622.65
because I did this tell me I don't know

2620.61 --> 2627.42
what I don't know what's gonna happen

2622.65 --> 2629.31
then why what no but what do you fear is

2627.42 --> 2633.66
gonna happen I want to hear it from you

2629.31 --> 2637.37
right not in it's an opportunity I feel

2633.66 --> 2640.29
well I guess there's a possibility that

2637.37 --> 2643.56
if those words that you said could be

2640.29 --> 2647.45
taken there were high level you could

2643.56 --> 2647.45
get yourself into a bit of trouble how

2648.56 --> 2655.0499999999997
well all I could just blow over

2651.06 --> 2658.56
or it could just blow over I want to

2655.05 --> 2662.55
know how is it gonna tell me tell me

2658.56 --> 2664.41
this scenario what's gonna happen how

2662.55 --> 2666.6000000000004
could it go wrong I want to know it from

2664.41 --> 2669.12
you know I don't want to hear vague

2666.6 --> 2669.81
suspicions it I want to hear it well

2669.12 --> 2672.3599999999997
that's all I have

2669.81 --> 2674.64
I just got by suspicions to tell you the

2672.36 --> 2677.01
truth I'll be honest with ya right well

2674.64 --> 2681.42
that could just as well be an illusion

2677.01 --> 2683.7900000000004
then that's true it could just be a fake

2681.42 --> 2686.9700000000003
fear that they have implanted in us with

2683.79 --> 2688.65
everything to do maybe this is exactly

2686.97 --> 2691.7099999999996
what we're all supposed to be doing a

2688.65 --> 2694.17
chocolate scene thanks for coming man

2691.71 --> 2699.5
morning the morning yeah it's not far

2694.17 --> 2699.5
when so was just

2703.54 --> 2707.89
yeah you're right I mean I was saying

2706.51 --> 2711.5400000000004
put just little blow over as well I

2707.89 --> 2717.7599999999998
would and I hope it does

2711.54 --> 2723.2799999999997
really oh hey steam oh hey hey welcome

2717.76 --> 2729.6400000000003
back thank you the other day sitting

2723.28 --> 2735.28
through with me yeah I suppose yeah any

2729.64 --> 2739.69
thoughts guys well like I told you

2735.28 --> 2743.23
before Arwen the other day like you went

2739.69 --> 2745.39
to what you want to nobody can really

2743.23 --> 2747.46
understand nobody nobody else was in

2745.39 --> 2750.7
your shoes so nobody knows what you went

2747.46 --> 2753.25
through right regardless of whatever

2750.7 --> 2755.2599999999998
that is and obviously it affected you oh

2753.25 --> 2758.05
yeah you had something you have to let

2755.26 --> 2760.69
that out and you did now people might

2758.05 --> 2763.3300000000004
not like what you said and you know

2760.69 --> 2766.39
that's whatever because if this is your

2763.33 --> 2769.15
show this is what you're putting out

2766.39 --> 2771.2799999999997
there and if they don't like it they

2769.15 --> 2771.61
don't like I mean again haters are gonna

2771.28 --> 2775.69
hate

2771.61 --> 2777.46
oh right I don't like it I don't know

2775.69 --> 2779.77
I'm sure you don't I'm sure you listen

2777.46 --> 2782.56
back to it was like [ __ ] this no no it

2779.77 --> 2786.06
was really but I don't like it because

2782.56 --> 2788.5
it's like an open wealthy ously not oh

2786.06 --> 2793.0
you would have to be a sick individual

2788.5 --> 2795.19
to like the display that you displayed I

2793.0 --> 2796.78
mean obviously that's not normal

2795.19 --> 2800.77
obviously you were going through some

2796.78 --> 2805.96
[ __ ] but at the end of the day I think

2800.77 --> 2808.36
you know you're better you know you've

2805.96 --> 2810.9
come out and said you feel better you

2808.36 --> 2814.6600000000003
got it out and that's what really counts

2810.9 --> 2817.0
now I don't know why people like you

2814.66 --> 2819.5499999999997
know Allenby and they want to come in

2817.0 --> 2821.71
and kind of stir the pot I know no

2819.55 --> 2823.42
that's what he's doing what it just

2821.71 --> 2825.55
seems like that's what he's doing I'm

2823.42 --> 2827.59
not sure why or what the purpose I don't

2825.55 --> 2830.38
know if he's genuinely trying to help

2827.59 --> 2832.96
you know but he's trying to get it

2830.38 --> 2834.4
lobotomized that's what it's trying to

2832.96 --> 2835.77
do is what they're all trying to do

2834.4 --> 2839.55
these

2835.77 --> 2844.92
for these times whatever on anything

2839.55 --> 2845.73
flat earth night they'll do it for 9/11

2844.92 --> 2849.33
people

2845.73 --> 2854.28
if things go that far they'll do it for

2849.33 --> 2858.84
your opinions on 9/11 okay it doesn't

2854.28 --> 2861.96
matter anything anything can and will

2858.84 --> 2864.3
eventually be used as an excuse to force

2861.96 --> 2869.93
you to be lobotomised that's what's

2864.3 --> 2873.42
gonna happen if we all let this happen

2869.93 --> 2877.5
but to see that you got this this kind

2873.42 --> 2880.02
of extra bit of troll effect from what

2877.5 --> 2881.43
happened yeah I don't know that there's

2880.02 --> 2883.74
something very wrong with that and I

2881.43 --> 2885.7799999999997
think that displays why you're so upset

2883.74 --> 2888.8399999999997
because there is something wrong with

2885.78 --> 2893.61
the world that's you being that pissed

2888.84 --> 2895.8900000000003
off at you know pedophiles and all that

2893.61 --> 2899.1
all that [ __ ] in that system you

2895.89 --> 2901.5899999999997
know the fact that trolls will come out

2899.1 --> 2903.2999999999997
now because of that because that's being

2901.59 --> 2906.57
exposed because somebody is talking

2903.3 --> 2909.4500000000003
about it I mean it's very telling you

2906.57 --> 2917.73
know what happens it shows that there's

2909.45 --> 2919.35
really people [ __ ] up out there and in

2917.73 --> 2922.5
a lot of ways I understand what Arwen

2919.35 --> 2924.6
saying cuz a lot of y'all you know y'all

2922.5 --> 2926.16
know who you are and you're out there

2924.6 --> 2928.83
playing with kids and doing [ __ ] like

2926.16 --> 2932.3399999999997
that you you should be [ __ ] you should

2928.83 --> 2937.35
be taking out you know that that's that

2932.34 --> 2941.19
[ __ ] ain't cool in I'm trying to be as

2937.35 --> 2943.65
nice saying that as I possibly can the

2941.19 --> 2947.13
problem can't really do that now can you

2943.65 --> 2949.8
nobody can really oh by the way

2947.13 --> 2952.31
chocolates saying you probably didn't

2949.8 --> 2955.77
see it but I'm gonna show you in Skype

2952.31 --> 2960.72
that one comment that I got

2955.77 --> 2963.71
just but be ready though it is one of

2960.72 --> 2966.6899999999996
the most savage comments I've ever read

2963.71 --> 2968.2200000000003
don't play that imperfect but just to

2966.69 --> 2973.619
give you a hint I got on what's out

2968.22 --> 2977.8999999999996
there I got I got a move for Suren

2973.619 --> 2984.27
lumber yeah whenever you ready man you

2977.9 --> 2987.75
guys yeah I just wanted to comment on

2984.27 --> 2989.49
Allenby specifically because the way he

2987.75 --> 2991.38
came in here today and the questions he

2989.49 --> 2993.93
was asking it's just terrible it's not

2991.38 --> 2995.67
necessary and chocolate you said you

2993.93 --> 2997.3199999999997
think it may be stirring the pot and

2995.67 --> 3000.59
you're not sure if he's being genuine

2997.32 --> 3002.54
but he's clearly not being genuine let

3000.59 --> 3004.96
yesterday I think was yesterday where he

3002.54 --> 3007.16
said something in the comments like

3004.96 --> 3010.04
don't say those kinds of things because

3007.16 --> 3011.33
this kids hurting or referring to our

3010.04 --> 3013.7599999999998
win and I thought hey that's really

3011.33 --> 3016.52
thoughtful you know but then today he

3013.76 --> 3018.3500000000004
comes in here and he says you know I

3016.52 --> 3020.39
contacted people who are supposed to be

3018.35 --> 3022.52
your friends and they're they said that

3020.39 --> 3024.08
they don't want to help you basically

3022.52 --> 3025.88
you know it's like coming in and saying

3024.08 --> 3026.75
hey you're X growth and I saw her with

3025.88 --> 3029.0
your best friend

3026.75 --> 3032.65
yeah I mean that's what that sounds like

3029.0 --> 3035.96
to me like why what would you you know

3032.65 --> 3038.51
trying to be genuine just pure evil and

3035.96 --> 3040.25
he'll he'll mask it by saying things

3038.51 --> 3042.65
like you should talk to the authorities

3040.25 --> 3044.6
and professionals which I agree with you

3042.65 --> 3046.1600000000003
know I think those people that that talk

3044.6 --> 3048.2
to you they know how to do it you just

3046.16 --> 3050.75
have to find the right fit for you you

3048.2 --> 3052.3689999999997
know our win disagrees and thinks he's

3050.75 --> 3054.41
the professional and that's fine you

3052.369 --> 3057.71
know that he he can deal with it however

3054.41 --> 3060.2
he wants but then he'll say other things

3057.71 --> 3064.48
that are absolutely horrific you know

3060.2 --> 3064.48
that he's trying to pull his strings

3064.99 --> 3071.8999999999996
yeah that's what it sounded like to me

3067.79 --> 3075.109
and yes that's it I mean obviously we

3071.9 --> 3077.39
had no proof of that but given the

3075.109 --> 3079.91
history of who when you say I tried the

3077.39 --> 3081.74
contact I try to contact people who are

3079.91 --> 3083.33
supposed to be your friends and they

3081.74 --> 3085.8199999999997
said that they don't want to contact you

3083.33 --> 3088.5499999999997
what good is that gonna do what good

3085.82 --> 3089.57
does that information do none it doesn't

3088.55 --> 3091.4900000000002
do anything

3089.57 --> 3093.4100000000003
it's like I said like saying oh hey I

3091.49 --> 3095.39
saw you at scope and I heard she was

3093.41 --> 3097.46
having sex with your best friend or

3095.39 --> 3099.5299999999997
whatever it does nothing it's just meant

3097.46 --> 3100.04
to hurt you and if you really believe

3099.53 --> 3101.9
that

3100.04 --> 3104.54
Arwen is going through what he's going

3101.9 --> 3106.79
through you don't say things like that

3104.54 --> 3110.21
and and where and where did or when I

3106.79 --> 3112.34
hate end up afterwards he ended up in

3110.21 --> 3115.37
the hangout with Nathan with me and

3112.34 --> 3124.4900000000002
Travis and riding on in Ranchi you know

3115.37 --> 3126.5299999999997
the people that that's why I understand

3124.49 --> 3135.02
where album becomes with that but okay

3126.53 --> 3139.9700000000003
good I'm glad you're doing better man

3135.02 --> 3155.48
you've seen better you know it's so

3139.97 --> 3159.47
weird because no the weird thing is what

3155.48 --> 3162.35
as I was approaching this my skin

3159.47 --> 3166.3399999999997
problem started to return pretty pretty

3162.35 --> 3169.88
vividly and I'm still yeah like it's

3166.34 --> 3173.5
still there but that's so telling like

3169.88 --> 3176.38
as I was approaching that depth

3173.5 --> 3180.65
psychosomatically everything was just

3176.38 --> 3186.32
responding to it and I hope he'll go

3180.65 --> 3188.12
I'll be beautiful once again so that is

3186.32 --> 3190.4300000000003
that is a stress reaction like I know

3188.12 --> 3192.0499999999997
people who break out into hives and

3190.43 --> 3195.2599999999998
stuff as soon as they get stressed out

3192.05 --> 3197.6600000000003
you know it is a your body reacts in

3195.26 --> 3200.1800000000003
certain ways ssangsun breaking out and

3197.66 --> 3201.89
having reactions like that on your skin

3200.18 --> 3206.33
that's that's one of those things that

3201.89 --> 3209.83
happen it's pretty bad sometimes like

3206.33 --> 3212.93
it's been worse like you deep you people

3209.83 --> 3218.5699999999997
everyone out here like yeah you saw what

3212.93 --> 3221.6299999999997
happened at 82 but like

3218.57 --> 3224.54
what is it three years ago I yeah I

3221.63 --> 3229.57
wasn't even doing anything with the Flat

3224.54 --> 3233.15
Earth thing yet it hit me though pretty

3229.57 --> 3236.84
at that time I guess it was my kind of

3233.15 --> 3239.1800000000003
with my waking moment thing where at

3236.84 --> 3241.07
first it was like pure joy pure release

3239.18 --> 3243.3799999999997
and then suddenly I went through

3241.07 --> 3248.15
something like this again and it was

3243.38 --> 3251.75
much worse that was such a savage deep

3248.15 --> 3253.76
pain that like I still had mental

3251.75 --> 3257.18
faculties but just everything else I was

3253.76 --> 3259.9700000000003
almost literally crippled physically

3257.18 --> 3266.18
crippled from constant pain sensations

3259.97 --> 3268.8799999999997
and soul pain and terrified and just out

3266.18 --> 3271.2799999999997
of my mind but cognitively still there

3268.88 --> 3274.9100000000003
just trying to think like what the [ __ ]

3271.28 --> 3278.02
is the am I gonna die literally like am

3274.91 --> 3280.16
I gonna die is this my final moments me

3278.02 --> 3285.05
going through it but yeah I survived I

3280.16 --> 3287.54
even survived that and this was much

3285.05 --> 3291.28
less much much less

3287.54 --> 3291.2799999999997
it's very intense though

3293.65 --> 3299.04
can be worse

3295.86 --> 3300.8700000000003
and I hope didn't it'll never I hope it

3299.04 --> 3303.9
just gets better and better and better

3300.87 --> 3310.8599999999997
well mm-hmm you hear me

3303.9 --> 3315.9900000000002
yes I suppose hey anyone so are we and I

3310.86 --> 3317.4
mean this this subject very delicate how

3315.99 --> 3320.91
do what do you think the solutions are

3317.4 --> 3322.62
like that the genuine solutions to you

3320.91 --> 3326.46
know this problem this this

3322.62 --> 3327.69
international problems you think there

3326.46 --> 3328.76
is a solution do you think it can be

3327.69 --> 3330.84
stopped

3328.76 --> 3334.59
do you think it can be prevented

3330.84 --> 3340.05
education exposure awareness things like

3334.59 --> 3342.75
that yes I mean because I only like to

3340.05 --> 3345.9900000000002
hear about being so tough it's so tough

3342.75 --> 3349.86
because yes we can but the problem is

3345.99 --> 3352.5299999999997
the more we do the harder the pressure

3349.86 --> 3356.63
will become and it is all leading up to

3352.53 --> 3361.6200000000003
a massive polarizing event basically

3356.63 --> 3365.01
right eventually the demons will take up

3361.62 --> 3368.27
arms in the sleepers and we will be

3365.01 --> 3371.6400000000003
forced to take up arms when you say yeah

3368.27 --> 3373.23
where you say demons which perspective

3371.64 --> 3375.48
are you coming from me coming from a

3373.23 --> 3378.09
biblical spiritual are you saying these

3375.48 --> 3380.31
demons are like within people are they

3378.09 --> 3384.2400000000002
from outside of the door if there is a

3380.31 --> 3387.0
very happens when you allow relies it's

3384.24 --> 3391.3799999999997
the hole in the consciousness it becomes

3387.0 --> 3393.69
a gateway to the darkness the spirit of

3391.38 --> 3396.65
lies the spirit of perversion the spirit

3393.69 --> 3398.96
of destruction

3396.65 --> 3402.44
that's the demons it's the dark force

3398.96 --> 3409.64
it's the darkness literally the darkness

3402.44 --> 3414.77
manifest through people so people bad

3409.64 --> 3419.21
people people that allow evil in there

3414.77 --> 3423.22
good yes I mean we would call that we

3419.21 --> 3423.2200000000003
would call that temptation

3423.37 --> 3433.13
maybe temptation seduction is a part of

3427.76 --> 3440.23
walking into the darkness it's always

3433.13 --> 3440.23
starts with temptation so yeah

3441.73 --> 3446.45
but yeah I just see it polarized further

3444.71 --> 3449.29
and I don't know I don't know if there

3446.45 --> 3449.29
is some kind of

3450.49 --> 3455.9799999999996
look I'm I'm one guy and I understand

3453.88 --> 3460.15
like the energies I understand that I

3455.98 --> 3464.25
can see with that but there's still also

3460.15 --> 3466.9900000000002
there's like the death there must be

3464.25 --> 3470.14
millions of people probably out there

3466.99 --> 3472.18
that are all awakening in their own way

3470.14 --> 3474.79
and now they're realizing the same kind

3472.18 --> 3476.5
of thing but responding to it

3474.79 --> 3480.46
differently I don't have oversight over

3476.5 --> 3481.96
all that actually the weird thing is and

3480.46 --> 3484.089
this is kind of odd

3481.96 --> 3488.01
like I've been looking into the deep you

3484.089 --> 3490.45
know like the previous episodes before

3488.01 --> 3491.8300000000004
81 and everything and just trying to

3490.45 --> 3493.839
figure out what is this what is this

3491.83 --> 3498.31
just looking into the deep into the

3493.839 --> 3504.27
knowledge and I feel now like I'm losing

3498.31 --> 3507.06
that okay I can't do it anymore

3504.27 --> 3508.38
maybe I shouldn't I don't want to I've

3507.06 --> 3514.7599999999998
seen enough

3508.38 --> 3514.76
and I need to focus on something else I

3515.24 --> 3522.24
don't understand really the sensation

3518.49 --> 3527.31
that came out of this in that sense I

3522.24 --> 3529.2299999999996
don't know as so when you say demons the

3527.31 --> 3532.98
way I take it it's in a spiritual sense

3529.23 --> 3534.9
yes but I I don't believe in the

3532.98 --> 3536.64
spirituality but I'm still understanding

3534.9 --> 3538.7400000000002
what you're saying because if you even

3536.64 --> 3541.35
take the me to movement for instance

3538.74 --> 3543.8399999999997
right a lot of it is nonsense but it's

3541.35 --> 3546.63
creating division but it is also causing

3543.84 --> 3549.3
people to wake up and stand up to the

3546.63 --> 3551.88
demons being the people who have done

3549.3 --> 3553.8
bad things to them you know to stand up

3551.88 --> 3554.67
to these people so I do agree that we

3553.8 --> 3556.92
are awakening

3554.67 --> 3558.7200000000003
and just little by little it's creating

3556.92 --> 3561.35
division and it's going to come to a

3558.72 --> 3564.27
head everything they're saying infn

3561.35 --> 3567.63
sleepers and awaken I set this to

3564.27 --> 3574.29
everyone that I knew with my parents my

3567.63 --> 3578.31
friends when I was like 20 or something

3574.29 --> 3580.2599999999998
I already knew this was I didn't even

3578.31 --> 3583.35
know flattered I didn't know but it is

3580.26 --> 3586.1400000000003
happening it's just what's happening and

3583.35 --> 3587.88
it's gonna pulverize more and more yeah

3586.14 --> 3589.83
you're absolutely right the only part

3587.88 --> 3591.84
the only disconnect I have with you is

3589.83 --> 3594.33
that you take it to a spiritual level

3591.84 --> 3596.82
and but if you look at it just in

3594.33 --> 3598.7999999999997
reality it's the same process that's

3596.82 --> 3600.6600000000003
happening you know I mean if you take

3598.8 --> 3602.4
like the bill cosby's of the world and

3600.66 --> 3604.68
consider them demons whether that's just

3602.4 --> 3607.77
theater or not you know it is happening

3604.68 --> 3609.75
out there you have a family a sister a

3607.77 --> 3612.33
brother who has experienced something

3609.75 --> 3614.25
like this from another demon or a bad

3612.33 --> 3615.99
person that did horrible things to them

3614.25 --> 3618.18
or maybe even yourself you have your own

3615.99 --> 3620.9399999999996
examples you know and you just have to

3618.18 --> 3623.43
realize that once you come out to this

3620.94 --> 3626.04
person and expose them if they're your

3623.43 --> 3628.3799999999997
family member you accuse them it's gonna

3626.04 --> 3631.38
divide you their families your brother

3628.38 --> 3633.54
it's gonna divide everyone but at the

3631.38 --> 3635.31
end of the day at least we are waking up

3633.54 --> 3637.23
and we're starting to stand up to these

3635.31 --> 3639.57
people or demons

3637.23 --> 3641.91
and that's what's important it's also

3639.57 --> 3645.869
about brain it's good cycle it's also

3641.91 --> 3651.0
about breaking this cycle yes more and

3645.869 --> 3655.02
more that that that pedophilia [ __ ] it

3651.0 --> 3657.66
really is a demon yeah it is almost like

3655.02 --> 3660.93
a creature outside of normal human

3657.66 --> 3663.06
consciousness that just hops from people

3660.93 --> 3667.97
to people over the generations and they

3663.06 --> 3670.5
turn into the same [ __ ] yeah and see I I

3667.97 --> 3672.45
don't see it that complicated I think

3670.5 --> 3674.25
it's just people who are not able to

3672.45 --> 3677.31
break the cycle I think people are

3674.25 --> 3679.44
molested as kids and so they manifest

3677.31 --> 3681.18
that by molesting kids when they're

3679.44 --> 3684.4500000000003
adults you know it just a cycle just

3681.18 --> 3687.0
keeps on repeating and like a normal

3684.45 --> 3689.7
psychological thing or you can see it as

3687.0 --> 3694.02
an entity of pure evil that's certain

3689.7 --> 3697.25
and you can stop adoration sure but when

3694.02 --> 3700.14
you talk that way I just see you as just

3697.25 --> 3702.24
crazy and just believing religion and

3700.14 --> 3704.16
stuff but if I just take that away I'm

3702.24 --> 3707.609
not saying that you're crazy but because

3704.16 --> 3710.7
it makes sense just on a level that we

3707.609 --> 3712.619
are actually experiencing as humans you

3710.7 --> 3714.8689999999997
know so I understand where the

3712.619 --> 3717.1800000000003
experience of humans reaches into all

3714.869 --> 3722.88
kinds of territory and look yeah

3717.18 --> 3728.1189999999997
demons it's metaphorical spiritual stuff

3722.88 --> 3735.77
all of spiritual stuff is metaphorical

3728.119 --> 3740.069
in a way really things that's what it is

3735.77 --> 3741.56
it's a name attack for a direction and

3740.069 --> 3746.96
energy

3741.56 --> 3749.9
in effect yeah if that energy can be

3746.96 --> 3751.37
counted at our accountant it was there's

3749.9 --> 3754.76
a positive if there's a negative there

3751.37 --> 3758.75
should be a positive to counter those

3754.76 --> 3761.69
negative feelings right yeah but by

3758.75 --> 3763.67
doing that by doing that you have to

3761.69 --> 3766.04
expose everything that's causing that

3763.67 --> 3768.53
and that creates division like in my

3766.04 --> 3771.98
example my dad was very physically and

3768.53 --> 3775.1000000000004
mentally abusive and my mom is uh skits

3771.98 --> 3776.84
religious schizophrenic okay so my wife

3775.1 --> 3778.58
and I didn't want to have kids for this

3776.84 --> 3780.53
reason because we didn't want our kids

3778.58 --> 3783.38
to have grandparents like that so we

3780.53 --> 3785.6600000000003
thought when we have kids we'll be when

3783.38 --> 3788.15
our parents die so our kids don't have

3785.66 --> 3790.79
to be exposed to them but instead what

3788.15 --> 3793.2400000000002
we did was we move far away away from

3790.79 --> 3795.8
our parents or our parents cannot

3793.24 --> 3798.1099999999997
influence our kids or potentially hit

3795.8 --> 3800.11
our kids and abuse our kids and so

3798.11 --> 3802.46
that's how we're breaking the cycle

3800.11 --> 3804.35
unfortunately it's caused a division

3802.46 --> 3807.02
because we don't talk to our parents we

3804.35 --> 3809.8399999999997
don't want to bring them closer and it

3807.02 --> 3811.91
hurts and our kids ask questions like

3809.84 --> 3814.19
where's grandma where's grandpa they see

3811.91 --> 3816.41
it in cartoons and it's a very painful

3814.19 --> 3819.62
experience and hopefully it doesn't

3816.41 --> 3821.5699999999997
cause our kids to then turn their anger

3819.62 --> 3823.31
on us like why didn't I have a

3821.57 --> 3825.1400000000003
grandparent you know and that kind of

3823.31 --> 3828.56
thing but at least we can break the

3825.14 --> 3831.14
cycle of abuse and us ourselves not hit

3828.56 --> 3833.2999999999997
our kids and abuse them mentally you

3831.14 --> 3836.27
know and that's I think that's the only

3833.3 --> 3839.1800000000003
way but it causes division because now

3836.27 --> 3841.0099999999998
my sisters are like oh my my brother

3839.18 --> 3843.0499999999997
thinks he's too good for our kids to

3841.01 --> 3846.46
visit us you know but I just don't I

3843.05 --> 3846.46
want to break the cycle

3847.63 --> 3853.12
right well that's sensible it's

3851.2 --> 3854.95
unbelievable that you would actually

3853.12 --> 3858.37
have to make a decision like that like

3854.95 --> 3860.62
you would have to say you know this side

3858.37 --> 3863.47
actually decide that I'm not gonna we're

3860.62 --> 3866.1099999999997
not gonna have kids just just to avoid

3863.47 --> 3868.66
that type of abuse or if we do decide we

3866.11 --> 3870.55
have to move weight like that's in the

3868.66 --> 3874.2999999999997
same and I feel free they had to vote

3870.55 --> 3878.0800000000004
like like we were not gonna have oh my

3874.3 --> 3880.3300000000004
god I was we were 35 when we decided to

3878.08 --> 3882.58
have kids it was late we were like are

3880.33 --> 3885.13
we really gonna have kids now it's kind

3882.58 --> 3889.5
of late you know but we're in the

3885.13 --> 3889.5
position to do it so it was very serious

3896.03 --> 3906.98
oh good on you for finding a way to

3899.87 --> 3910.8199999999997
break that cycle so oh and what's the

3906.98 --> 3913.82
direction of the channel are is it still

3910.82 --> 3916.4300000000003
flat earth are you disgusting I mean are

3913.82 --> 3920.4500000000003
you welcoming ball earth is on to try

3916.43 --> 3925.72
and prove the blow or you know are you

3920.45 --> 3925.72
directing it towards this it's just been

3925.87 --> 3934.7599999999998
wow that's what I'm wondering about well

3932.03 --> 3938.09
flat earth debate is back on so in then

3934.76 --> 3941.4100000000003
sense that whole is feeling again yes

3938.09 --> 3944.27
you would feel that slot before Nathan

3941.41 --> 3948.5899999999997
after I don't know where it's going like

3944.27 --> 3950.18
dirt in a way yeah now I'm gonna feed

3948.59 --> 3954.29
the trolls again like I am kind of

3950.18 --> 3957.41
worried in that sense in a tactical

3954.29 --> 3960.32
sense it's no tactics really evolved

3957.41 --> 3964.8199999999997
that this happened because yak and I you

3960.32 --> 3968.3500000000004
know get back to where I was before this

3964.82 --> 3971.1800000000003
oh I don't know I don't know maybe I

3968.35 --> 3973.46
mean maybe the point is not to get back

3971.18 --> 3976.64
to where you were before but move to

3973.46 --> 3982.58
advance to a further position you move

3976.64 --> 3985.2799999999997
forward not back definite meaning that

3982.58 --> 3987.95
out you know everything you know that

3985.28 --> 3990.0800000000004
you've needed to I think I mean I don't

3987.95 --> 4004.08
think you'll do that again will you what

3990.08 --> 4004.08
do you think I don't know really

4006.3 --> 4011.28
that's for sure but probably not like

4010.36 --> 4014.02
this

4011.28 --> 4016.3
yeah but you were quite you know you

4014.02 --> 4018.88
quite upset that day so that's why I

4016.3 --> 4022.4500000000003
thought I should come on because you

4018.88 --> 4025.09
know definitely needed you know talking

4022.45 --> 4026.5299999999997
to because yeah if you wouldn't like I'm

4025.09 --> 4028.699
sure you wouldn't like to see anyone

4026.53 --> 4031.5890000000004
laugh

4028.699 --> 4033.92
well when you said the wound is open

4031.589 --> 4037.2889999999998
right it's been opened and now you just

4033.92 --> 4039.469
have to express it and that's good this

4037.289 --> 4042.2090000000003
is a good a good process if that was

4039.469 --> 4047.339
plateau of it right well that's kind of

4042.209 --> 4049.41
in retrospect the purpose that I gave to

4047.339 --> 4051.029
it once it happened and that is like

4049.41 --> 4053.5789999999997
okay this is messed up

4051.029 --> 4056.969
like when I just happen it's like oh my

4053.579 --> 4059.579
god what did they do but then I thought

4056.969 --> 4063.839
like yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna use this

4059.579 --> 4066.9
I'm gonna use this to show how you can

4063.839 --> 4070.65
deal with this [ __ ] when you have it so

4066.9 --> 4074.64
I chose to do that and just show how it

4070.65 --> 4079.2290000000003
heals to demonstrate that it can be done

4074.64 --> 4082.6189999999997
and hopefully that will come across to

4079.229 --> 4084.959
other people that are actually having

4082.619 --> 4088.65
similar type of issues and they're just

4084.959 --> 4091.319
terrified of going there and maybe this

4088.65 --> 4096.029
can show them like yeah you can you can

4091.319 --> 4100.67
confront it and you can then fix it it's

4096.029 --> 4100.67
not hopeless so

4101.29 --> 4107.47
that's good that's that's good I wonder

4104.83 --> 4109.18
I wanted mr. president I want to use it

4107.47 --> 4112.6
as an example real quick

4109.18 --> 4115.6
because yeah this whole thing brought

4112.6 --> 4118.96
you some trolls but I mean if we take

4115.6 --> 4121.120000000001
earth flattener for example I mean I

4118.96 --> 4123.22
think even that day I'm not trying to

4121.12 --> 4125.23
blow it up but it just was out there

4123.22 --> 4129.400000000001
like he said I wouldn't subscribe to our

4125.23 --> 4132.429999999999
ones crazy right but look look a few

4129.4 --> 4135.429999999999
days later now he subscribed and now

4132.43 --> 4137.26
he's on your panel you know I mean like

4135.43 --> 4139.030000000001
this is what I'm talking about advancing

4137.26 --> 4142.27
moving forward instead of going

4139.03 --> 4145.2699999999995
backwards so put on your planner I

4142.27 --> 4148.030000000001
couldn't watch it just a little bit I

4145.27 --> 4151.120000000001
understand the beginning and I saw my

4148.03 --> 4153.5199999999995
mom and it hurt it really hurt a lot to

4151.12 --> 4156.01
watch it you know so I just want you to

4153.52 --> 4158.56
know that I see where you're coming from

4156.01 --> 4160.81
of course I'm not gonna ever be in your

4158.56 --> 4164.47
shoes you know but I see that you're in

4160.81 --> 4166.990000000001
pain and I just want you to get better

4164.47 --> 4172.72
you know that's what's important I am

4166.99 --> 4175.63
and thank you for for seeing it thank

4172.72 --> 4177.76
you it was a disaster all reaction like

4175.63 --> 4179.29
what I just saw maybe a couple met

4177.76 --> 4180.67
somebody told me hey you gotta watch it

4179.29 --> 4182.53
cause he really blew his top

4180.67 --> 4184.99
and it was just a couple of minutes and

4182.53 --> 4187.2699999999995
I just got this visceral reaction and I

4184.99 --> 4189.099999999999
just I couldn't continue watching it I

4187.27 --> 4191.290000000001
was like I know exactly what he's going

4189.1 --> 4193.33
through you know and we have to we have

4191.29 --> 4195.13
to try to help them as best as we can

4193.33 --> 4196.63
you know and not by trolling I'm not by

4195.13 --> 4198.55
saying terrible things you know just

4196.63 --> 4200.77
like just by being here just by being

4198.55 --> 4201.7
here for you yeah and I really

4200.77 --> 4205.320000000001
appreciate it

4201.7 --> 4210.099999999999
and I'm just glad that that you got it

4205.32 --> 4212.259999999999
that I am NOT alone with this in the

4210.1 --> 4214.360000000001
world that where nobody gets it here

4212.26 --> 4217.66
because that is almost kind of a fear

4214.36 --> 4219.3099999999995
that also stops you because you're

4217.66 --> 4221.5599999999995
afraid that you're gonna be all alone

4219.31 --> 4224.080000000001
and you're gonna be declared mad and

4221.56 --> 4226.68
institutionalize and all that [ __ ] yeah

4224.08 --> 4228.01
all that fear is there and to see that

4226.68 --> 4230.469
Wow

4228.01 --> 4233.29
people actually do get it

4230.469 --> 4236.32
they don't even have to say it just the

4233.29 --> 4237.79
way they respond even a couple of think

4236.32 --> 4240.37
I could just see it like oh my god they

4237.79 --> 4244.0199999999995
really do get it and that's just really

4240.37 --> 4244.0199999999995
that's that gives me hope

4244.38 --> 4247.89
yeah you're not alone

4254.499 --> 4261.989
and I really appreciate it and in that

4258.13 --> 4265.150000000001
sense I'm glad that I did it because

4261.989 --> 4267.249
does feel like yeah there's just now

4265.15 --> 4270.219
people out there that are that are

4267.249 --> 4272.079
getting closer to me and that's really

4270.219 --> 4275.849
the people that mattered the most I

4272.079 --> 4275.849
guess to me

4278.06 --> 4287.51
it's it polarized everything around me

4281.78 --> 4290.15
and now I can just see the the darkness

4287.51 --> 4292.7
darkening deeper and the light growing

4290.15 --> 4297.67
lighter and I just know these people are

4292.7 --> 4297.67
good and these people are not good

4299.159 --> 4302.0599999999995
and yeah

4305.05 --> 4311.91
and I'm glad there are still a lot of

4306.61 --> 4311.91
good people it's a great relief

4314.13 --> 4320.9400000000005
so sometimes you just got to let that

4318.09 --> 4323.610000000001
rage out man and just as this is the

4320.94 --> 4326.94
outlet that you have so this is outlet

4323.61 --> 4331.62
that you use and also one thing that I

4326.94 --> 4335.099999999999
feel now is that there's so much longing

4331.62 --> 4339.3
I also have that with releasing this

4335.1 --> 4342.81
inner rage the longings came back for a

4339.3 --> 4347.070000000001
world for the world things like I kind

4342.81 --> 4350.160000000001
of do want to like do some bow shooting

4347.07 --> 4353.009999999999
or something and as I said before like

4350.16 --> 4356.15
would be pretty cool stunt to have just

4353.01 --> 4361.16
a couple of earth globe thingies and

4356.15 --> 4361.16
then start shooting them with my problem

4361.85 --> 4368.22
yeah you ever think of beginning of the

4364.32 --> 4371.04
bags take you take of like a punching

4368.22 --> 4373.35
bag thank you for me having a punching

4371.04 --> 4376.05
bag is one of the best stress relievers

4373.35 --> 4378.660000000001
you could have I used to have one close

4376.05 --> 4382.49
and believe me on that I know I know I

4378.66 --> 4387.75
used to have one and then I destroyed it

4382.49 --> 4389.969999999999
yeah I've gone through a couple yeah as

4387.75 --> 4399.98
a teen I definitely had one of those and

4389.97 --> 4399.9800000000005
I need but now now not so much

4402.02 --> 4411.290000000001
Oh another to late night I don't know

4406.13 --> 4416.09
it's more like when the moon is really

4411.29 --> 4419.81
that's all but what I thought I know but

4416.09 --> 4422.96
for me what works better is marching

4419.81 --> 4426.05
sounds kind of weird is just walking

4422.96 --> 4430.28
very persistently with like walking with

4426.05 --> 4434.63
strength that are walking we call that

4430.28 --> 4437.12
power walking in America not in the

4434.63 --> 4441.77
sporty ways not other exercise right but

4437.12 --> 4446.599999999999
like right maybe a determined soldier

4441.77 --> 4452.330000000001
yeah exactly it's marching Nazi

4446.6 --> 4454.820000000001
instincts but it were it works like

4452.33 --> 4456.44
walking and yeah walking through the

4454.82 --> 4461.349999999999
forest and just walking that path

4456.44 --> 4465.23
it is a literal ization of the metaphor

4461.35 --> 4469.13
it works really well and also what works

4465.23 --> 4471.83
well is just riding a bicycle and doing

4469.13 --> 4475.34
it enthusiastically putting energy into

4471.83 --> 4484.3099999999995
it not just taking it easy doing it for

4475.34 --> 4486.34
real and that also helps a lot these

4484.31 --> 4489.620000000001
things could all be a form of meditation

4486.34 --> 4493.1
and I like what I used to get home from

4489.62 --> 4495.64
work my old job and you know I carried

4493.1 --> 4497.96
around a lot of rage decided me too and

4495.64 --> 4499.22
sometimes I didn't know how to apply

4497.96 --> 4501.47
that cuz I can't just run around

4499.22 --> 4502.9400000000005
punching people in the face and taking

4501.47 --> 4506.4800000000005
people in the throat because you know I

4502.94 --> 4510.679999999999
need to keep my job and live in society

4506.48 --> 4512.15
right so you know using my bag when I

4510.68 --> 4515.0
would get home and hit that thing like

4512.15 --> 4517.5199999999995
it was just it was a form of meditation

4515.0 --> 4518.99
you know you could use anything it's

4517.52 --> 4522.77
meditation you don't have to just sit

4518.99 --> 4524.929999999999
there in a lotus position saying umm you

4522.77 --> 4527.900000000001
know anything you can concentrate on and

4524.93 --> 4529.91
focus on that's that could be your

4527.9 --> 4533.509999999999
meditation I used to meditate doing

4529.91 --> 4535.82
push-ups just continuing to do sets as

4533.51 --> 4540.2300000000005
many pushups as I could it you know

4535.82 --> 4542.87
and as long as you focus on what you're

4540.23 --> 4545.12
doing and you get whatever else is out

4542.87 --> 4549.11
of your you know

4545.12 --> 4551.599999999999
consciousness I know it works man yeah

4549.11 --> 4554.87
it does absolutely but when I'm like in

4551.6 --> 4557.39
this pain position thing it's bad

4554.87 --> 4559.34
pushing up doesn't kind of it it might

4557.39 --> 4562.0
work for you but if I do that then

4559.34 --> 4565.13
sometimes I could just like muscles

4562.0 --> 4568.85
spasm wrong and yeah I'm just using

4565.13 --> 4570.95
myself as an example good it's good

4568.85 --> 4572.96
example it does work but for me for some

4570.95 --> 4576.349999999999
reason that's that specifically does not

4572.96 --> 4578.33
work like pushing up and [ __ ] it works

4576.35 --> 4581.990000000001
when I do it when I feel normal and

4578.33 --> 4584.72
strong then yet like do that is

4581.99 --> 4586.49
rewarding it's very nice but when I feel

4584.72 --> 4591.2300000000005
like that while the depressed kind of

4586.49 --> 4594.08
thing it's usually from the hips it's

4591.23 --> 4597.919999999999
like walking bicycling and doing that

4594.08 --> 4600.17
persistently with dedication that seems

4597.92 --> 4604.13
to be one of the few things that really

4600.17 --> 4606.4400000000005
works well for me and are doing things

4604.13 --> 4608.4800000000005
with my arms not so much I don't know

4606.44 --> 4613.759999999999
why maybe it's too close to my heart or

4608.48 --> 4616.07
something well I will agree with L&B

4613.76 --> 4617.66
that talking to someone like a

4616.07 --> 4619.849999999999
psychologist or something like that

4617.66 --> 4624.28
would probably be the most beneficial

4619.85 --> 4626.39
but I think it seems like you just found

4624.28 --> 4630.639999999999
spirituality is that right like you just

4626.39 --> 4633.85
found Christ or yes No

4630.64 --> 4635.530000000001
time okay okay all right because I was

4633.85 --> 4636.63
gonna say that but you have to learn to

4635.53 --> 4639.46
do that

4636.63 --> 4642.55
it's yeah you need to do it it's

4639.46 --> 4644.59
something does it's not like oh I'm

4642.55 --> 4646.6900000000005
converting to Christ you get baptized oh

4644.59 --> 4650.9800000000005
yeah now you know everything it's just

4646.69 --> 4653.41
no it's just a start really yeah I'm not

4650.98 --> 4654.959999999999
getting baptized by the way but I'm just

4653.41 --> 4656.95
doing it my own way

4654.96 --> 4659.8
yeah well I was gonna say I'm not

4656.95 --> 4662.349999999999
religious but I think finding Christ and

4659.8 --> 4665.110000000001
using spirituality I think that can be

4662.35 --> 4666.910000000001
therapeutic too so that's good that you

4665.11 --> 4669.07
at least have that but if you found it a

4666.91 --> 4670.63
long time then it might not be the

4669.07 --> 4674.83
Avenue that's working considering you're

4670.63 --> 4677.8
still having these bouts right so I

4674.83 --> 4679.75
might I would say maybe talking to a

4677.8 --> 4685.29
professional like Allenby said might

4679.75 --> 4691.72
might help it might it might just

4685.29 --> 4695.19
finding the rock for me no look I am one

4691.72 --> 4697.81
I've talked to so many of these people

4695.19 --> 4700.96
specialists on all levels from

4697.81 --> 4706.75
psychiatrists psychologists social

4700.96 --> 4710.89
worker I out master them all seriously

4706.75 --> 4714.07
yeah seriously I've actually perverted

4710.89 --> 4718.360000000001
to helping psychologists with their

4714.07 --> 4720.37
personal problems because I would

4718.36 --> 4722.799999999999
already they would ask me something like

4720.37 --> 4724.93
how is this and this and then I say yeah

4722.8 --> 4726.85
that and that and this is exactly the

4724.93 --> 4730.33
solution and my plan on how to dealing

4726.85 --> 4733.030000000001
with it okay it's just there's nothing

4730.33 --> 4735.5199999999995
for them to do I already know all this

4733.03 --> 4739.78
[ __ ] I already know it your instinct

4735.52 --> 4743.17
just it's there it's not that I don't

4739.78 --> 4746.95
have a plan it's just that it sucks to

4743.17 --> 4748.6
go through it that's all yeah I know

4746.95 --> 4750.58
what you're saying because I used to use

4748.6 --> 4753.01
the same kind of tactic for me it was

4750.58 --> 4757.83
more when I went to a psychologist I

4753.01 --> 4759.7
would use comedy kind of like to down

4757.83 --> 4761.47
downplay what was actually happening

4759.7 --> 4763.24
with me and then it would just become a

4761.47 --> 4764.030000000001
conversation about how are their kids

4763.24 --> 4765.32
and

4764.03 --> 4767.36
you know what do they do and of course

4765.32 --> 4769.639999999999
they're just people so I would turn the

4767.36 --> 4772.339999999999
conversation around to them instead of

4769.64 --> 4775.37
internalizing and feel dealing with what

4772.34 --> 4778.07
I was actually going through so you

4775.37 --> 4780.05
being the therapist doesn't help it's

4778.07 --> 4783.41
like a if you have a doctor if you have

4780.05 --> 4785.06
two doctors that are hard surgeons they

4783.41 --> 4787.58
can't work on themselves they need each

4785.06 --> 4789.830000000001
other to fix that issue right right and

4787.58 --> 4790.97
so they're professionals they know all

4789.83 --> 4793.25
about it but they're not going to be

4790.97 --> 4795.26
able to do it to themselves and it's the

4793.25 --> 4796.76
same with your mind you think that you

4795.26 --> 4804.8
can work it out in your mind but it's

4796.76 --> 4806.81
different to think it to talk it out to

4804.8 --> 4809.78
be you don't really need a psychologist

4806.81 --> 4813.4400000000005
for that you just need a friend I don't

4809.78 --> 4815.54
need the expertise of that field I have

4813.44 --> 4818.36
it I just need somebody

4815.54 --> 4821.54
I agree with that doesn't have to be

4818.36 --> 4823.73
some professional we agree if you have

4821.54 --> 4827.18
the right friend who knows how to talk

4823.73 --> 4829.94
to you in a the right way yes you that's

4827.18 --> 4834.4400000000005
almost better that person actually knows

4829.94 --> 4837.5599999999995
you right to be if he is able to have

4834.44 --> 4840.259999999999
some type of bias enough to actually be

4837.56 --> 4842.06
able to help you to so it's immense it

4840.26 --> 4847.7
depends on how close the friend is and

4842.06 --> 4850.25
you know there are factors to it like a

4847.7 --> 4852.05
heart surgeon heart surgeon you're not

4850.25 --> 4853.97
gonna find a friend who's going to be

4852.05 --> 4857.6
able to do heart surgery on you right

4853.97 --> 4860.4800000000005
and people don't consider the mind and

4857.6 --> 4863.72
going through a psychological process of

4860.48 --> 4866.8099999999995
evaluation as critical as a heart as

4863.72 --> 4869.51
physically removing a heart but it is

4866.81 --> 4872.39
the mind is the most important thing the

4869.51 --> 4874.37
most important tool that we have you

4872.39 --> 4875.780000000001
know so it's you just have to just

4874.37 --> 4877.55
consider it I'm not saying it's the

4875.78 --> 4880.13
answer but you know maybe you just

4877.55 --> 4883.610000000001
haven't found your right deep it hear me

4880.13 --> 4887.36
didn't you hear me I did hear you then

4883.61 --> 4891.53
why are you asking the same thing why

4887.36 --> 4893.15
would I do that because what what I'm

4891.53 --> 4894.869
saying is that maybe you just haven't

4893.15 --> 4896.79
found the right fit

4894.869 --> 4899.339999999999
because you're a really smart guy you

4896.79 --> 4901.349
have a thought process and so maybe it

4899.34 --> 4902.219
just is just taking finding the right

4901.349 --> 4905.179
person

4902.219 --> 4907.9800000000005
who who is this right person this right

4905.179 --> 4911.28
professional according to you does that

4907.98 --> 4914.909
exist or should I just be looking for

4911.28 --> 4917.46
people that get me yeah maybe not I

4914.909 --> 4919.44
don't know I don't think there is a

4917.46 --> 4922.59
professional out there that can help

4919.44 --> 4925.32
this you know I mean I just go into

4922.59 --> 4927.57
debate how their psychological by the

4925.32 --> 4930.57
psychiatry man oh is it manual is a

4927.57 --> 4936.0
complete piece of [ __ ] filled with lies

4930.57 --> 4940.82
that's what we'd end up with what's it's

4936.0 --> 4943.739
all the entire psychiatry it's all

4940.82 --> 4947.909
compartmentalization and symptomatic

4943.739 --> 4950.78
sand there's no holism to it if I need

4947.909 --> 4956.73
to be healed and not going there okay

4950.78 --> 4959.13
I'll go to alternative sources I'll go

4956.73 --> 4962.33
in looking into Rudolf Steiner that kind

4959.13 --> 4965.82
of thing I'll go to somebody that

4962.33 --> 4969.0599999999995
understands God and Christ and those

4965.82 --> 4971.909
healing that's where I'm going

4969.06 --> 4974.13
that's where I can get something because

4971.909 --> 4978.08
the psychiatrist's you know they're just

4974.13 --> 4978.08
trying to mind-control you in the end

4978.8 --> 4983.150000000001
yeah they're just funny I guess

4987.6 --> 4990.2300000000005
so

4990.51 --> 4996.780000000001
I kind of see what flat in this point

4994.05 --> 4998.820000000001
though is I mean people have been helped

4996.78 --> 5002.15
by speaking to professional people you

4998.82 --> 5004.13
know it's not that it it that such such

5002.15 --> 5007.25
a thing doesn't just at all

5004.13 --> 5012.71
you know happily I would like to add

5007.25 --> 5015.2
something sorry sorry I want to add a

5012.71 --> 5020.84
piece of information to all of this okay

5015.2 --> 5024.5
I do see a social worker and I know that

5020.84 --> 5027.14
a good relationship with then seeing

5024.5 --> 5029.36
them since I started living here also to

5027.14 --> 5030.62
deal with this kind of [ __ ] so I do it's

5029.36 --> 5033.339999999999
not a psychologist

5030.62 --> 5037.21
somebody's a really good listener and

5033.34 --> 5042.08
that's really nice so I'd already have

5037.21 --> 5044.6
this good that's excellent yeah but it's

5042.08 --> 5049.03
always been there it's always been there

5044.6 --> 5051.5
something like that but in the end it's

5049.03 --> 5053.36
it's not really the thing that helps me

5051.5 --> 5056.27
the most it's almost more like my

5053.36 --> 5058.07
journal that's how I treat social work

5056.27 --> 5059.900000000001
it's like my journal I bring out a

5058.07 --> 5061.73
report like oh yeah I'm going through

5059.9 --> 5062.8099999999995
this and going through that this is

5061.73 --> 5064.489
where I think I'm going and they're

5062.81 --> 5066.47
always like ok cool sounds like you've

5064.489 --> 5070.28
got everything in order

5066.47 --> 5076.22
yeah I do I figured it out it just need

5070.28 --> 5078.59
to talk about it and well maybe you

5076.22 --> 5080.09
should show them one of these videos

5078.59 --> 5082.54
where you're reacting like this would

5080.09 --> 5084.83
you consider that or would that be crazy

5082.54 --> 5087.739
no I'll tell them about it

5084.83 --> 5090.17
I'll tell them exactly about it and I

5087.739 --> 5092.48
will share maybe yeah I have this yeah I

5090.17 --> 5095.39
discover I rediscovered this [ __ ] and

5092.48 --> 5097.37
they will absolutely be able to talk

5095.39 --> 5100.79
about it with me because yeah that [ __ ]

5097.37 --> 5102.5599999999995
is going on out here it's great that's

5100.79 --> 5104.06
great because I mean you then you are

5102.56 --> 5106.870000000001
dealing with it in some way and that's

5104.06 --> 5108.950000000001
excellent because yeah I mean I think

5106.87 --> 5111.59
everybody think I'm not

5108.95 --> 5115.63
you think if I wasn't dealing with it I

5111.59 --> 5119.42
would be feeling this ok two days later

5115.63 --> 5121.28
yeah you're right that's true

5119.42 --> 5123.4400000000005
because people were probably thinking

5121.28 --> 5126.11
you were gonna just disappear or drop

5123.44 --> 5128.0
off or not you just roll the fact that

5126.11 --> 5130.339999999999
you were back the next day doing your

5128.0 --> 5133.25
show and you know right back at it I

5130.34 --> 5138.4400000000005
guess maybe people were like oh maybe

5133.25 --> 5139.699
he's not okay and he's I mean again let

5138.44 --> 5146.36
people think what they're gonna think

5139.699 --> 5148.28
man don't even stress them oh he must be

5146.36 --> 5152.389999999999
insane now he's gonna do this every day

5148.28 --> 5155.449
and then what he got better no he must

5152.39 --> 5157.610000000001
have been acting because if you're that

5155.449 --> 5160.07
crazy then you're always like that

5157.61 --> 5165.62
that's the over generalization that a

5160.07 --> 5168.65
lot of people do yeah that's a good

5165.62 --> 5170.54
point I'm sorry I thought of you and

5168.65 --> 5172.879999999999
just in just that way like you were

5170.54 --> 5174.38
falling apart I mean if you have people

5172.88 --> 5175.64
behind you and you're dealing with it if

5174.38 --> 5178.1
you're here two days later and you're

5175.64 --> 5180.1990000000005
normal and you are being very rationally

5178.1 --> 5181.969
I've never done all you're saying then

5180.199 --> 5184.16
well you know in the scheme of things

5181.969 --> 5187.52
none of us are normal but it's still

5184.16 --> 5190.21
gonna be a wizard al yeah you're clearly

5187.52 --> 5192.89
working it out so that's good I'm glad

5190.21 --> 5194.63
and I'm getting my sense of humor back

5192.89 --> 5197.21
to a bit because when you're dead

5194.63 --> 5203.2300000000005
freaking depressed humor doesn't really

5197.21 --> 5206.679
work and I really want it back

5203.23 --> 5209.049999999999
because I have a lot of fun with

5206.679 --> 5214.75
when I have like comedies things

5209.05 --> 5221.17
happening naturally I like it but yeah I

5214.75 --> 5224.23
am dealing with it I'm dealing with it

5221.17 --> 5228.6990000000005
here and I'm dealing it there but yeah

5224.23 --> 5231.699
it's like it could also be it it could

5228.699 --> 5233.5
also be an element of rejection so I'm

5231.699 --> 5236.969
sure there are some people who see you

5233.5 --> 5239.44
get that emotional and intense and

5236.969 --> 5242.44
because they can't achieve that type of

5239.44 --> 5246.04
intensity with their own emotions they

5242.44 --> 5248.589999999999
look down on you for that instead of

5246.04 --> 5250.989
being able to do what they gotta do it's

5248.59 --> 5252.85
they just keep it inside them yeah that

5250.989 --> 5256.419999999999
scares them but I mean we're humans were

5252.85 --> 5258.400000000001
emotional it's what we are you know you

5256.42 --> 5260.469
can't really fight that and when you do

5258.4 --> 5264.9
that's when you're really bad should

5260.469 --> 5268.449
happens and people explode in you know

5264.9 --> 5272.17
yeah yeah that's exactly right it's

5268.449 --> 5274.389999999999
exactly right and I knew I knew that I

5272.17 --> 5275.679
felt that coming like this is coming

5274.39 --> 5279.85
there's something coming I don't know

5275.679 --> 5283.03
what it is but and then yeah I know

5279.85 --> 5285.870000000001
instinctively like if when it comes you

5283.03 --> 5292.62
must let it out because if you don't oh

5285.87 --> 5295.3
my god that's when the true mental

5292.62 --> 5297.5199999999995
dislocation starts to set in that's when

5295.3 --> 5301.26
the holes in your consciousness start to

5297.52 --> 5305.47
open up if you don't deal with it and

5301.26 --> 5310.900000000001
can twist you and look

5305.47 --> 5313.860000000001
that happened before to me so I'm gonna

5310.9 --> 5313.86
let that happen again

5317.52 --> 5324.660000000001
so I'm gonna just deal with it anyway

5322.14 --> 5326.7300000000005
yeah I guess people are just not

5324.66 --> 5328.83
desensitized to that kind of emotion

5326.73 --> 5330.209999999999
like chocolate was saying but people do

5328.83 --> 5332.37
it everyday like through video games

5330.21 --> 5334.44
Call of Duty and all this stuff killing

5332.37 --> 5336.78
people whenever I see somebody at the

5334.44 --> 5339.12
store yeah knowing people it looks like

5336.78 --> 5341.73
to me like they're really killing people

5339.12 --> 5343.32
yeah it just gives me this horrible like

5341.73 --> 5346.049999999999
feeling like I cannot believe they're

5343.32 --> 5348.509999999999
just smiling about it and people will

5346.05 --> 5350.46
say it's just a video game but to me I

5348.51 --> 5353.360000000001
don't play video again so it looks very

5350.46 --> 5357.12
real and I just want to run away from it

5353.36 --> 5359.28
you know I get the same thing now like I

5357.12 --> 5360.24
used to love playing like shooters and

5359.28 --> 5363.44
all that [ __ ]

5360.24 --> 5365.91
and you're more Gore the better you know

5363.44 --> 5368.19
they're very instinct or something but

5365.91 --> 5372.57
now yeah i watch people playing the game

5368.19 --> 5374.759999999999
and it's like Jesus it's yeah you are

5372.57 --> 5379.67
getting off on it and that's okay but

5374.76 --> 5383.34
also like getting more maniacal more

5379.67 --> 5386.04
psychopathic yeah cooling down becoming

5383.34 --> 5390.0
more calculatedly brutal and [ __ ] and

5386.04 --> 5391.56
that is scary yes you are like people

5390.0 --> 5393.15
are like you know what I'm just playing

5391.56 --> 5395.580000000001
a game I'm just shooting I know it's not

5393.15 --> 5397.44
real but when you're somewhere with the

5395.58 --> 5399.51
troupe of people or however this works

5397.44 --> 5401.429999999999
and they kill the whole crew the

5399.51 --> 5403.35
reaction is real they're really pissed

5401.43 --> 5404.91
off and they're like okay next round I'm

5403.35 --> 5407.370000000001
gonna get you and I'm gonna kill all

5404.91 --> 5409.59
these people myself so they are having

5407.37 --> 5411.57
the same exact reaction that you did the

5409.59 --> 5412.59
other day but they don't even realize it

5411.57 --> 5414.24
because they're used to it they're

5412.59 --> 5419.400000000001
desensitized but in the end it's the

5414.24 --> 5422.58
same thing we're all the same it is it

5419.4 --> 5426.53
is the natural mechanism

5422.58 --> 5426.53
oh that's part of it

5428.13 --> 5434.08
yeah any human and any animal for that

5431.89 --> 5437.85
and all most animals if you push them

5434.08 --> 5437.85
hard enough they will turn into

5438.42 --> 5445.63
something something else like your cat

5442.72 --> 5447.58
in a corner and see what happens yeah a

5445.63 --> 5450.91
mom and her baby try to do something to

5447.58 --> 5453.85
a moms baby yes sure rip your face open

5450.91 --> 5456.07
with her nails dude a pregnant lady I

5453.85 --> 5458.17
saw at McDonald's and someone cut her in

5456.07 --> 5461.259999999999
line and she reacted like they took food

5458.17 --> 5469.2300000000005
from her baby's mouth she freaked out it

5461.26 --> 5469.2300000000005

5470.98 --> 5476.259999999999
