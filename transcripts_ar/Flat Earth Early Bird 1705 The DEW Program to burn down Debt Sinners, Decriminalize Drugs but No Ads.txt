it's kind of Sunny now

102.54 --> 110.159
wasn't like the last hour

106.92 --> 113.6
I think it actually rained for a bit

110.159 --> 113.60000000000001
but yeah there's a lot of wind

113.939 --> 120.17999999999999
it's a bit of rainy here and there big

115.86 --> 124.399
clouds but also a nice Clear Blue Skies

120.18 --> 124.399
in between that like right now

130.86 --> 133.58
all right

142.94 --> 148.379
let's contrast this up

146.879 --> 152.16
yeah

148.379 --> 155.879
hello Ryan ertherton first in chat

152.16 --> 161.94
Oz Richard G good to see you

155.879 --> 161.94
it is Wednesday the 30th of August 2023

164.22 --> 166.64
uh

179.28 --> 181.94
yeah

182.04 --> 188.34
I feel okay

184.2 --> 190.5
let's had a pretty good sleep but man

188.34 --> 193.739
yesterday was weird

190.5 --> 195.659
like I think I'm not sure where when

193.739 --> 197.64000000000001
that happened when that happened like

195.659 --> 200.879
last night or something but

197.64 --> 201.89999999999998
I think I got stung by a mosquito a big

200.879 --> 205.379
one

201.9 --> 207.72
because like my my arm like almost swell

205.379 --> 210.72
up from that [ __ ]

207.72 --> 212.7
wasn't just one spot that's kind of big

210.72 --> 213.599
because of typical Mesquite that you

212.7 --> 216.42
know

213.599 --> 218.879
like the round thing no it was like the

216.42 --> 221.28
entire muscle was just like

218.879 --> 223.62
weird and you could like put my finger

221.28 --> 226.68
on it and the mark would just stay and

223.62 --> 228.78
[ __ ] it's it's a little better now but

226.68 --> 231.44
yesterday night was like what the [ __ ]

228.78 --> 231.44
is this man

232.459 --> 237.62
but yeah there have been a lot of

234.36 --> 237.62
mosquitoes going around it's

238.019 --> 241.86
a bit of a hazard when I go to sleep

240.18 --> 243.9
because then I have to like hunt for

241.86 --> 247.37900000000002
them for at least half an hour

243.9 --> 249.37900000000002
because they're all gonna try to get me

247.379 --> 249.379
um

249.42 --> 256.5
African proficient at hunting them

253.5 --> 257.94
I feel like like a jungle plant or

256.5 --> 260.28
something

257.94 --> 262.32
just sitting there

260.28 --> 264.96
waiting until the exact right moment and

262.32 --> 267.979
then just swatting them

264.96 --> 267.979
out of the air

274.02 --> 278.18
hello slo-mo moon buggy good to see you

282.3 --> 285.02000000000004
right

289.02 --> 293.479
so tomorrow I have to get up really

291.24 --> 293.479
early

295.08 --> 301.74
for my yeah for the welfare situation I

299.52 --> 304.74
have to like reports so I I wonder what

301.74 --> 306.6
they're gonna be doing maybe it's just

304.74 --> 308.1
looking more like a checkup I don't know

306.6 --> 310.139
what it is

308.1 --> 312.97900000000004
it's just annoying that I have to get up

310.139 --> 312.979
so early for that

313.8 --> 316.46000000000004
ugh

320.88 --> 324.56
right but that's tomorrow anyway

330.74 --> 335.34000000000003
right so yesterday Flat Earth debate

334.32 --> 338.65999999999997
it's pretty good

335.34 --> 338.65999999999997
[Music]

339.9 --> 346.85999999999996
I got in just a couple of moments it was

344.16 --> 348.41900000000004
hard to get in there

346.86 --> 351.68
it was all very technical very

348.419 --> 351.68
housekeeping oriented

355.38 --> 361.34
right uh

358.62 --> 361.34000000000003
what else

372.06 --> 375.56
yeah of course kiwi live

376.22 --> 382.259
I didn't watch too much of it I think it

379.86 --> 385.02000000000004
was uh

382.259 --> 388.58000000000004
Brian versus Whitsett

385.02 --> 388.58
was reviewing that

391.759 --> 397.199
right other than that was like

395.34 --> 399.96
relatively uneventful

397.199 --> 403.759
Dr Shiva had a whole bunch of videos but

399.96 --> 403.75899999999996
I mean he has a lot of videos every day

412.259 --> 414.8
foreign

419.419 --> 425.52
traveler good to see you

421.74 --> 428.16
if you watched yesterday's QE episode

425.52 --> 431.25899999999996
well a part of it yeah

428.16 --> 431.259
[Music]

437.88 --> 441.84
but I was also like doing uh like

440.34 --> 444.0
watching other stuff at the same time

441.84 --> 445.38
I've been continuing like the lock and

444.0 --> 449.0
key series

445.38 --> 449.0
now into season three

449.419 --> 453.44
seems like very typical

455.759 --> 460.86
I'm starting to see a formula for how

458.4 --> 463.67999999999995
they work because it's starting to know

460.86 --> 466.28000000000003
like they have a story progression

463.68 --> 469.74
mechanism and that is

466.28 --> 473.34
the kids try to do something

469.74 --> 476.0
to like finally finish it off like to

473.34 --> 478.08
finish off the demon and then things go

476.0 --> 480.96
monstrously wrong

478.08 --> 482.34
and that seems to be like the way they

480.96 --> 484.63899999999995
keep

482.34 --> 487.85999999999996
it's like

484.639 --> 489.90000000000003
accidental escalation so that basically

487.86 --> 492.18
things happen it gets interesting and

489.9 --> 494.81899999999996
they all have to like

492.18 --> 497.639
get to work to basically correct the

494.819 --> 500.94
accident like it's a very interesting

497.639 --> 503.12
way to to do that though like At first I

500.94 --> 505.56
was just like ah what are you doing

503.12 --> 508.08
why are you doing that so and not

505.56 --> 509.94
because it's like oh I can't like that

508.08 --> 512.459
doesn't make any sense to do that but

509.94 --> 513.86
rather than no that's not a good timing

512.459 --> 517.02
that's rash

513.86 --> 520.2
so at first I didn't even see it that it

517.02 --> 522.36
was kind of a formula but now much later

520.2 --> 525.72
like it's happened a couple of times and

522.36 --> 530.12
like yeah okay that's what that is

525.72 --> 530.12
fine keep it rolling

530.399 --> 538.019
it is interesting but I mean the third

532.92 --> 540.54
season does become a bit watered down in

538.019 --> 542.399
a way like

540.54 --> 545.519
like it's starting to turn into Harry

542.399 --> 549.66
Potter sort of

545.519 --> 553.82
it's just starting to feel more

549.66 --> 553.8199999999999
what you call that more cliche

555.06 --> 559.26
which is kind of a [ __ ] like this even

557.22 --> 561.48
throughout the second season was quite a

559.26 --> 564.12
thrill like I was very impressed third

561.48 --> 564.72
season seems like

564.12 --> 566.88
um

564.72 --> 570.0600000000001
[Music]

566.88 --> 573.24
it seemed like the actual carefully

570.06 --> 575.399
planned story ran out and now they're

573.24 --> 577.5600000000001
using the setting

575.399 --> 580.26
the like

577.56 --> 583.8599999999999
put it up try to put it all together but

580.26 --> 586.74
it's like something they obviously

583.86 --> 589.4590000000001
like hadn't taken into account the whole

586.74 --> 593.779
way so it really feels like

589.459 --> 593.779
like an added on season

594.48 --> 599.76
compared to the first two

597.42 --> 602.16
but I mean I'm it's still very

599.76 --> 604.58
entertaining it's still worth it it's a

602.16 --> 609.38
very good series overall

604.58 --> 609.38
despite a certain episode

611.88 --> 618.0
because like most of it is not woke

615.12 --> 619.68
but like

618.0 --> 622.68
uncool

619.68 --> 624.959
is gay and there's one episode that's

622.68 --> 628.68
literally about the gay wedding and I'm

624.959 --> 628.68
like uh really

629.519 --> 632.48
uh-huh

634.08 --> 638.4590000000001
it's like

635.76 --> 640.38
and it's annoying because I like all the

638.459 --> 643.0799999999999
everybody in there it's just like that

640.38 --> 645.12
part is like I I'm just gonna pretend

643.08 --> 647.94
that it's not there yeah it's the

645.12 --> 650.64
wedding uh it's the wedding of an

647.94 --> 652.019
unknown person that's definitely not gay

650.64 --> 653.88
no that's

652.019 --> 657.48
I was literally just trying to block

653.88 --> 659.399
that out to get through it

657.48 --> 661.98
uh

659.399 --> 665.519
that was the only part that was like

661.98 --> 668.899
okay this is just

665.519 --> 668.899
just annoying

670.68 --> 678.8599999999999
although it seemed that like

674.459 --> 678.8599999999999
he moves away after that so it's like

679.079 --> 685.079
it's with it dare I say with intolerance

682.62 --> 690.3
limits I mean for what the entire series

685.079 --> 692.519
delivered I mean it's like okay okay

690.3 --> 695.5999999999999
they had to do it

692.519 --> 695.6
or something

695.88 --> 701.88
but overall it isn't really terrible

700.019 --> 704.279
I mean there are some things that just

701.88 --> 708.4399999999999
doesn't really don't really make like my

704.279 --> 708.4399999999999
Owen Benjamin instincts are like

709.32 --> 713.22
were kind of like at certain points like

712.019 --> 717.44
uh

713.22 --> 717.44
that's not what I would have done

720.26 --> 725.3
but uh yeah it's it's it's still good

725.64 --> 730.3199999999999
and it's so much of it it's really big

728.82 --> 732.48
series

730.32 --> 735.5400000000001
it's like 30 episodes in total and

732.48 --> 738.6
that's a lot for like and I think like

735.54 --> 740.6999999999999
an hour or so yeah

738.6 --> 743.399
30 hours

740.7 --> 746.5400000000001
anyway

743.399 --> 746.54
low Crockett

765.42 --> 771.42
right also like I finished like watching

769.139 --> 774.1800000000001
back the Star Wars Trilogy the original

771.42 --> 776.16
one well fortunately there were all the

774.18 --> 777.54
edited version and like with the last

776.16 --> 781.639
one

777.54 --> 781.639
they're like so ruin it

781.74 --> 784.399
like

788.579 --> 796.1999999999999
to like insert

790.88 --> 798.899
Anakin's head from like the the prequels

796.2 --> 801.24
as Darth Vader's ghost at the end is

798.899 --> 803.88
like so wrong

801.24 --> 808.44
and like the way he even stands there

803.88 --> 811.2
and looks is so [ __ ] wrong it

808.44 --> 815.5790000000001
literally like rapes the entire's film

811.2 --> 818.1600000000001
like that one part alone

815.579 --> 821.16
it's like

818.16 --> 823.56
like yeah we just had to remind you that

821.16 --> 824.8199999999999
there's a trilogy

823.56 --> 827.54
but

824.82 --> 827.5400000000001
ugh

834.62 --> 839.76
I've been thinking about like

837.48 --> 842.82
he really did

839.76 --> 844.98
like a just over it's like George Lucas

842.82 --> 848.72
just got over enthusiastic with the

844.98 --> 848.72
stupid CGI [ __ ] and

849.48 --> 854.72
he got two micromanaging minded

856.56 --> 861.3
because like there were throughout the

859.62 --> 863.7
entire Star Wars strategy there were

861.3 --> 866.88
plenty of Parts where like inserting

863.7 --> 871.279
like a little bit of extra CGI was

866.88 --> 871.279
actually just pretty cool like it fit it

872.279 --> 879.36
but it's just that it was so overdone

875.88 --> 882.0
like too many things

879.36 --> 884.82
too many alterations

882.0 --> 888.24
and then like if you've never seen the

884.82 --> 892.5
original ones and you see this

888.24 --> 895.32
it's [ __ ] like it's not gonna be magical

892.5 --> 897.86
to you like it's just gonna be annoying

895.32 --> 897.86
[ __ ]

900.42 --> 905.699
but anyway yeah I mean that

903.779 --> 906.54
everybody I guess already knows that it

905.699 --> 908.88
just

906.54 --> 910.92
watching it without Nostalgia goggles it

908.88 --> 915.56
really stood out to me

910.92 --> 915.56
like like there's no point in doing that

920.76 --> 927.3
it's like the original Star Wars had

923.519 --> 931.32
some traits that were you could consider

927.3 --> 933.18
to be like slightly movie Magic childish

931.32 --> 937.38
a bit

933.18 --> 938.579
like the format right but then like just

937.38 --> 940.62
the

938.579 --> 942.66
like the impressiveness of the Empire

940.62 --> 944.519
and the style of it like that would

942.66 --> 947.399
compensate for it even though that would

944.519 --> 950.279
also be considerably like slightly fairy

947.399 --> 952.44
tale type childish

950.279 --> 955.4399999999999
but it really worked

952.44 --> 959.339
but now with all the goofiness being

955.44 --> 962.519
thrown in there and like oh more more uh

959.339 --> 964.6800000000001
Alien animals doing weird [ __ ] and

962.519 --> 966.18
falling over and like Oh that's oh look

964.68 --> 968.04
at I'm doing something in the second

966.18 --> 971.6389999999999
like every second had to be filled up

968.04 --> 975.48
with some attention grabby little aliens

971.639 --> 978.36
like oh oh I'm so special [ __ ] off just

975.48 --> 980.9590000000001
get out of my face you [ __ ]

978.36 --> 980.9590000000001
this is

984.44 --> 990.839
and it's

987.54 --> 994.4399999999999
it's like he over emphasized the the

990.839 --> 999.74
silly Part and that just ruins the whole

994.44 --> 999.74
balance the whole chemistry of it all

1004.1 --> 1009.8000000000001
turned Luke Skywalker from a Jetta hero

1007.16 --> 1014.62
to a loser hiding on that yeah well

1009.8 --> 1014.62
that's those are the after movies I mean

1018.019 --> 1023.24
you could barely even really call them

1020.72 --> 1025.4
Star Wars movies

1023.24 --> 1027.679
I mean there were some things about it

1025.4 --> 1030.3390000000002
that were interesting

1027.679 --> 1030.3390000000002
but

1032.36 --> 1037.9589999999998
it just it it didn't work

1038.24 --> 1043.16
it was a St those were Star Wars themed

1041.299 --> 1045.5
movies

1043.16 --> 1048.3190000000002
they weren't Star Wars movies they were

1045.5 --> 1050.799
Star Wars themed movies that's what I

1048.319 --> 1050.799
felt like

1076.22 --> 1079.71
okay

1078.2 --> 1081.14
anyway

1079.71 --> 1084.3400000000001
[Music]

1081.14 --> 1084.3400000000001
load Nathan r

1088.84 --> 1092.1789999999999
[Music]

1090.38 --> 1095.5
but yeah I thought that was kind of

1092.179 --> 1095.5
annoying too but I mean

1100.88 --> 1106.5200000000002
think about it like this Nathan R think

1103.52 --> 1109.46
carefully okay

1106.52 --> 1111.5
who's Luke Skywalker he became this Jedi

1109.46 --> 1113.66
he defeated

1111.5 --> 1117.44
the emperor even

1113.66 --> 1121.22
fought all this Rebellion [ __ ] yeah

1117.44 --> 1122.6000000000001
you go now now because they don't they

1121.22 --> 1125.66
should

1122.6 --> 1128.78
have put this in then in the newer

1125.66 --> 1132.799
movies right because the guys freaking

1128.78 --> 1136.28
war-torn like yeah he's a Jedi hero but

1132.799 --> 1138.039
literally everybody he knew

1136.28 --> 1141.559
is dead

1138.039 --> 1144.32
everybody he knew was dead okay all his

1141.559 --> 1148.8999999999999
friends all his family that he grew up

1144.32 --> 1148.8999999999999
with everything that he knows was dead

1151.16 --> 1156.46
and planets have been blown up and [ __ ]

1153.62 --> 1156.4599999999998
and it's like

1156.62 --> 1160.4189999999999
and then

1158.9 --> 1164.24
it's like the

1160.419 --> 1167.72
emperor empire still doesn't go away

1164.24 --> 1170.0
right all that combination does actually

1167.72 --> 1172.46
warrant a bit that he's he basically

1170.0 --> 1175.58
breaks from like post-traumatic stress

1172.46 --> 1178.58
it's like yeah he's a Jedi he overcame

1175.58 --> 1180.6789999999999
it but that doesn't mean that his life

1178.58 --> 1183.559
isn't completely [ __ ] over and

1180.679 --> 1188.679
everybody he knew is dead and then after

1183.559 --> 1188.6789999999999
the war he has to face the all that

1189.86 --> 1194.6
and so

1191.299 --> 1197.48
if you look at it like that which they

1194.6 --> 1200.32
should absolutely have act actually

1197.48 --> 1200.32
inserted

1200.539 --> 1206.36
in that movie and they didn't it like

1203.84 --> 1207.86
left it for some side comment it's

1206.36 --> 1209.6
really stupid

1207.86 --> 1212.78
or if you think of it like that then

1209.6 --> 1215.1789999999999
it's actually kind of logical

1212.78 --> 1218.1789999999999
that he's like yeah I

1215.179 --> 1220.1000000000001
I'll sacrifice everything I defeated the

1218.179 --> 1222.74
emperor

1220.1 --> 1225.86
lost my freaking hand and everything and

1222.74 --> 1229.34
and still a [ __ ]

1225.86 --> 1232.539
first order is now still blowing up

1229.34 --> 1232.539
planets like

1235.4 --> 1242.7800000000002
going Yoda which is what he was doing

1238.84 --> 1246.02
returning going to that remote planet is

1242.78 --> 1248.62
not that odd

1246.02 --> 1248.62
foreign

1251.6 --> 1257.86
of a hero that everybody kind of longed

1254.48 --> 1257.8600000000001
for after he basically

1258.32 --> 1263.86
won

1260.48 --> 1263.8600000000001
after Star Wars six

1264.679 --> 1271.1000000000001
right so it's both the expectation and

1267.86 --> 1273.32
just poor storytelling that made it such

1271.1 --> 1276.08
a so out of place

1273.32 --> 1280.34
and a bummer

1276.08 --> 1283.6399999999999
but it is logical that he did that

1280.34 --> 1286.76
if you actually think about everything

1283.64 --> 1291.4
that's happened to that character

1286.76 --> 1291.4
I should be a writer nah

1292.159 --> 1298.2800000000002
I can give pointers I can help shape

1296.299 --> 1302.74
stories and ideas

1298.28 --> 1302.74
the writing part not so much though

1311.299 --> 1317.059
maybe I should it's just that I have a

1315.14 --> 1318.0200000000002
lot of writers blocking that kind of

1317.059 --> 1320.12
stuff

1318.02 --> 1323.84
but if there's something already going

1320.12 --> 1326.78
then it's for me like writing is just

1323.84 --> 1330.3799999999999
like how do you better describe it you

1326.78 --> 1333.3799999999999
can just remake things because

1330.38 --> 1335.659
the comp like what's happening is

1333.38 --> 1338.0
already manifested like the story is

1335.659 --> 1340.159
manifested then how you write it is

1338.0 --> 1343.34
basically adapting it to what's

1340.159 --> 1345.6200000000001
virtually happening right that's less

1343.34 --> 1349.76
hard than actually

1345.62 --> 1353.299
making up what's happening

1349.76 --> 1356.0
to actually make a story

1353.299 --> 1358.4
if the story is there then like adapting

1356.0 --> 1361.28
things within it that's very second

1358.4 --> 1366.5
nature to me that's like how I made my

1361.28 --> 1366.5
DND book the trolls and tyrants update

1366.98 --> 1373.179
with actually making a story itself is

1369.5 --> 1373.179
not so easy for me

1379.22 --> 1386.6000000000001
yeah trolls have been going around

1382.82 --> 1389.74
some ass wipes like [ __ ] with my email

1386.6 --> 1389.74
very annoying

1394.94 --> 1398.98
thank God for the spam filter

1399.59 --> 1402.74
[Music]

1405.14 --> 1409.0990000000002
[Music]

1444.799 --> 1450.46
right but I think that technically

1451.28 --> 1455.059
I would have written Luke Skywalker as

1453.919 --> 1457.5800000000002
like

1455.059 --> 1460.48
having PTSD

1457.58 --> 1460.48
on that island

1461.36 --> 1467.9799999999998
because he just was kind of whiny and

1465.14 --> 1467.98
demoralized

1468.98 --> 1474.74
and

1471.62 --> 1477.32
no do papoons and I'm gonna forgive you

1474.74 --> 1479.659
this one time because if you read the

1477.32 --> 1482.4189999999999
check rules in the description box then

1479.659 --> 1484.22
you know that asking for wrenches it's

1482.419 --> 1487.179
not it's not a

1484.22 --> 1487.179
it's not allowed

1487.88 --> 1492.44
so no you don't get a wrench

1490.94 --> 1495.679
duper

1492.44 --> 1498.7
nobody asks for a wrench

1495.679 --> 1498.7
in my chat

1502.88 --> 1507.5
don't make me regret trying to protect

1505.34 --> 1511.6
you from everybody trying to ban you

1507.5 --> 1511.6
because you're kind of a numpty at times

1521.83 --> 1527.84
[Music]

1523.84 --> 1527.84
right anyhow

1533.659 --> 1539.1200000000001
what I would have done with Luke

1536.179 --> 1542.9
Skywalker is I would have like appealed

1539.12 --> 1544.1
to his the earlier instincts that he had

1542.9 --> 1546.44
right

1544.1 --> 1548.48
remember the failure at the cave and

1546.44 --> 1551.5
like he has to go I have to I have to

1548.48 --> 1551.5
save it for my friends

1551.72 --> 1554.48
like it doesn't matter if it's a trap

1553.58 --> 1556.9399999999998
right

1554.48 --> 1560.179
he should be fighting that

1556.94 --> 1562.22
and in a way he philosophically was but

1560.179 --> 1563.48
he wasn't viscerately he wasn't like

1562.22 --> 1565.94
with

1563.48 --> 1568.52
because he should be like PTSD

1565.94 --> 1569.8400000000001
conflicted where he actually does want

1568.52 --> 1571.52
to rush

1569.84 --> 1574.12
towards it

1571.52 --> 1574.12
but

1574.94 --> 1579.1000000000001
doesn't

1576.2 --> 1579.1000000000001
because

1579.64 --> 1585.14
of the yeah because of the damage that

1583.94 --> 1587.96
is done

1585.14 --> 1589.8200000000002
but still struggle with it like they

1587.96 --> 1592.7
should have made him like

1589.82 --> 1595.58
struggling against his own impulse to

1592.7 --> 1598.3400000000001
actually want to go out and fight

1595.58 --> 1603.3999999999999
because maybe he would see that as the

1598.34 --> 1603.3999999999999
dark side trying to seduce him again

1604.159 --> 1610.279
like something like that

1607.34 --> 1612.08
would have been much more character wise

1610.279 --> 1615.2
in place

1612.08 --> 1617.96
with Luke Skywalker in my opinion

1615.2 --> 1620.539
right and it would have yielded the same

1617.96 --> 1623.059
result it would have still gone with

1620.539 --> 1625.1
them even in this in the projection form

1623.059 --> 1628.299
or whatever

1625.1 --> 1628.299
and done his thing

1633.86 --> 1638.36
and it would have felt much more like

1636.38 --> 1640.5390000000002
the actual Luke Skywalker that was all

1638.36 --> 1640.539
there

1673.7 --> 1676.72
right anyhow

1676.82 --> 1682.299
that was that Star Wars stuff thinking

1679.76 --> 1682.299
about it

1683.12 --> 1685.7199999999998
laughs

1701.0 --> 1703.0
um

1712.64 --> 1715.64
okay

1730.299 --> 1733.539
damn it

1735.26 --> 1737.919
ah

1758.659 --> 1763.3400000000001
right so yeah I need feedback from the

1761.48 --> 1766.0
show yesterday

1763.34 --> 1766.0
Maybe

1766.279 --> 1769.279
foreign

1775.039 --> 1780.679
a lot of information in yesterday's show

1778.64 --> 1782.659
like a lot of things that I tapped into

1780.679 --> 1785.0800000000002
it like it couldn't fit in the title

1782.659 --> 1785.0800000000002
altogether

1786.26 --> 1789.98
I haven't actually watched it back but I

1788.659 --> 1793.3400000000001
kind of want to watch it back because

1789.98 --> 1796.059
there was just a lot of things in that I

1793.34 --> 1796.059
talked about yesterday

1812.09 --> 1815.369
[Music]

1817.56 --> 1820.69
[Music]

1846.82 --> 1853.73
man I'm getting the sniffles

1850.6 --> 1853.73
[Music]

1856.46 --> 1859.059
foreign

1860.32 --> 1864.1
where where is that

1876.34 --> 1879.8799999999999
for a sake

1889.179 --> 1893.419
I had a hamburger yesterday I haven't

1891.86 --> 1896.02
had that in

1893.419 --> 1898.64
like two years

1896.02 --> 1901.58
but it was nice though

1898.64 --> 1904.88
to do that again for a change

1901.58 --> 1906.3799999999999
Florida hmm

1904.88 --> 1910.3600000000001
okay

1906.38 --> 1910.3600000000001
well as long as uh

1910.7 --> 1915.0800000000002
the power management actually shuts down

1913.399 --> 1918.1999999999998
the power

1915.08 --> 1919.6999999999998
and the bushes have been properly

1918.2 --> 1924.74
trimmed

1919.7 --> 1926.539
then that shouldn't be like a huge issue

1924.74 --> 1928.52
other than well if it's really strong

1926.539 --> 1929.779
it's gonna probably blow some houses

1928.52 --> 1932.4189999999999
apart

1929.779 --> 1934.419
unfortunately

1932.419 --> 1934.419
um

1956.08 --> 1962.02
Auntie June next month okay well

1963.02 --> 1967.6399999999999
better than right now Oz

1990.74 --> 1997.159
yeah by the way

1993.519 --> 1998.8990000000001
there's a weird thing

1997.159 --> 2000.7
the show

1998.899 --> 2005.8799999999999
when was it

2000.7 --> 2005.88
yeah the one that kind of went to [ __ ]

2009.22 --> 2013.48
I've seen some stuff like even now

2011.62 --> 2016.779
through Infowars

2013.48 --> 2021.84
about Maui and like

2016.779 --> 2021.84
yeah I guess that

2022.179 --> 2027.279
it's like a combined situation what

2024.58 --> 2029.98
happened there because apparently duw

2027.279 --> 2031.72
weapons have been used and it and it's

2029.98 --> 2032.8600000000001
like they're really pushing it even in

2031.72 --> 2035.26
your face

2032.86 --> 2037.9799999999998
I'm just saying like lasers too because

2035.26 --> 2042.84
some blue stuff has been left in

2037.98 --> 2042.84
but I've seen like actual footage now

2043.84 --> 2047.1589999999999
and like yeah

2047.26 --> 2054.54
burning grass can't actually

2050.56 --> 2054.54
like melt a car

2054.82 --> 2058.839
when the car is only surrounded by a

2057.159 --> 2062.399
bunch of grass

2058.839 --> 2062.399
yeah that there's like

2063.52 --> 2069.22
there would have to be like a flame

2065.379 --> 2070.359
torrent so powerful you would see like

2069.22 --> 2073.419
more

2070.359 --> 2076.24
more damage surrounding it because then

2073.419 --> 2078.7
there would be like a tunnel of flame

2076.24 --> 2080.56
like

2078.7 --> 2083.08
like a torch

2080.56 --> 2085.899
would have to continually then move past

2083.08 --> 2090.0989999999997
in order to melt that you wouldn't have

2085.899 --> 2093.04
like evenly burned looking grass

2090.099 --> 2095.28
it would be like a deep scorch

2093.04 --> 2099.52
surrounding that and you didn't see that

2095.28 --> 2102.3390000000004
melted yeah but cars melt anyway like if

2099.52 --> 2104.859
there's a firestorm cars are are good

2102.339 --> 2107.56
and can definitely melt I mean that's

2104.859 --> 2110.74
the point about a firestorm

2107.56 --> 2114.16
regular fires are turned into Blow

2110.74 --> 2117.24
torches like it's all one blowtorch

2114.16 --> 2117.24
that's a firestorm

2118.599 --> 2124.1800000000003
but there are some things that just not

2121.54 --> 2128.2799999999997
logically possible if it's not

2124.18 --> 2128.2799999999997
surrounded by enough burning material

2129.09 --> 2134.2000000000003
[Music]

2131.98 --> 2136.359
right so if it's isolated I don't want

2134.2 --> 2137.859
you guys to freaking ramble on about

2136.359 --> 2141.06
this by the way

2137.859 --> 2144.64
but it's just weird

2141.06 --> 2146.68
to see that afterward when I'm like yeah

2144.64 --> 2149.98
yeah yeah like could you just stop

2146.68 --> 2151.8999999999996
[ __ ] obsessing out for duws all the

2149.98 --> 2154.8
time the ews

2151.9 --> 2157.6600000000003
and then it turns out that it is

2154.8 --> 2160.48
involved but it's probably not the thing

2157.66 --> 2162.64
that actually started the fire here's

2160.48 --> 2164.92
here's how I think it happened

2162.64 --> 2167.2599999999998
they let the storm happen electrical

2164.92 --> 2170.32
fire started it then is when it got

2167.26 --> 2172.3
fired up enough I think that they got

2170.32 --> 2175.0
the green light and then basically

2172.3 --> 2179.8590000000004
started zapping

2175.0 --> 2182.56
to like guarantee it would reach that

2179.859 --> 2183.88
that real blow torch level

2182.56 --> 2186.339
fire

2183.88 --> 2188.52
that's what I think that happened so

2186.339 --> 2191.14
they didn't just like oh

2188.52 --> 2195.52
and suddenly the fire started no no they

2191.14 --> 2199.0
they had on the ground neglect

2195.52 --> 2201.22
to basically Start the Fire and then

2199.0 --> 2204.339
once the fire started they started

2201.22 --> 2207.9599999999996
zapping to like guarantee it so they

2204.339 --> 2211.54
used the the ground neglect based fire

2207.96 --> 2214.2
as a cover to basically blast the [ __ ]

2211.54 --> 2214.2
out of the place

2215.98 --> 2223.54
so that's my reassessment of it

2220.3 --> 2227.8590000000004
it does not make me very happy

2223.54 --> 2232.8
I mean I re I'm like this is really bad

2227.859 --> 2232.7999999999997
guys that that exists I mean we have

2232.9 --> 2237.4
military technology that is like worse

2235.839 --> 2240.7599999999998
than nukes

2237.4 --> 2244.359
this is worse they can literally

2240.76 --> 2247.0600000000004
like freaking Pink Panther Strikes Back

2244.359 --> 2250.9
the fastbander laser they can literally

2247.06 --> 2253.839
just oh it's erased remember that silly

2250.9 --> 2256.859
movie from the from the 80s probably not

2253.839 --> 2260.0789999999997
comedy movie Pink Panther

2256.859 --> 2263.38
exclusive right it's one of my all-time

2260.079 --> 2264.94
favorite movies from my youth

2263.38 --> 2268.119
it's kind of old

2264.94 --> 2271.3
but like that laser like oh erase the UN

2268.119 --> 2274.42
building yeah well that's [ __ ] hair

2271.3 --> 2275.6800000000003
now yeah we got [ __ ] fastbander

2274.42 --> 2277.9
lasers

2275.68 --> 2279.839
all over the [ __ ] place apparently

2277.9 --> 2282.9
and they just like

2279.839 --> 2286.18
it's all gone it's all

2282.9 --> 2288.76
disintegrated oh that's now [ __ ]

2286.18 --> 2292.24
standard military equipment that's kind

2288.76 --> 2295.5
of being kept secret but not really even

2292.24 --> 2295.5
and that's [ __ ] up

2297.119 --> 2302.859
thanks for apologizing

2300.04 --> 2306.72
[ __ ] you mean thanks for apologizing I'm

2302.859 --> 2310.96
not apologizing I'm correcting myself

2306.72 --> 2313.24
after getting new data

2310.96 --> 2316.06
I'm not apologizing what I said

2313.24 --> 2320.16
originally not all fires are started by

2316.06 --> 2320.16
duws did stand

2320.94 --> 2327.2200000000003
it seems like buyers in Greece weren't

2324.579 --> 2329.1400000000003
started by the eows that were started

2327.22 --> 2334.2599999999998
with gasoline

2329.14 --> 2334.2599999999998
and and crazy cultist teens and [ __ ]

2335.92 --> 2338.46
right

2355.119 --> 2359.28
yeah I've heard of that here we go again

2357.4 --> 2362.5
yeah guess what

2359.28 --> 2364.96
[ __ ] all of that all these [ __ ] blue

2362.5 --> 2368.32
[ __ ]

2364.96 --> 2371.7400000000002
oh there's a deadly new weapon in the

2368.32 --> 2375.28
world all that means we have to wear

2371.74 --> 2378.9399999999996
blue now because we're gonna be defined

2375.28 --> 2381.2200000000003
by the fear of the new weapon that could

2378.94 --> 2384.46
just be used at any moment

2381.22 --> 2386.3799999999997
so we're gonna completely redefine our

2384.46 --> 2388.96
entire life

2386.38 --> 2391.839
by making everything blue what we wear

2388.96 --> 2394.54
blue and painting everything blue just

2391.839 --> 2397.2999999999997
on the off chance that we might be

2394.54 --> 2400.9
targeted by the new super weapon like

2397.3 --> 2403.2400000000002
how [ __ ] pathetic are you

2400.9 --> 2407.46
how [ __ ] pathetic are why don't you

2403.24 --> 2407.4599999999996
just realize it's [ __ ] over

2407.92 --> 2413.38
however this game is playing out you do

2410.38 --> 2418.119
not have control if if somewhere on the

2413.38 --> 2420.28
board click happens you [ __ ] die

2418.119 --> 2423.04
you get disintegrated there's nothing

2420.28 --> 2427.26
you can do about it wearing [ __ ] blue

2423.04 --> 2427.2599999999998
all your life isn't gonna help you dude

2431.079 --> 2440.079
it's [ __ ] over the power the just the

2436.619 --> 2443.82
Earthly Powers have become too strong

2440.079 --> 2443.82
it's [ __ ] over guys

2443.85 --> 2446.929
[Music]

2451.9 --> 2458.02
The Rules of Engagement

2454.66 --> 2461.2
have won

2458.02 --> 2462.7599999999998
the rule game of like who can be

2461.2 --> 2465.7599999999998
targeted

2462.76 --> 2468.4
is now Supreme

2465.76 --> 2470.6800000000003
because they cannot be taken out of

2468.4 --> 2474.42
power anymore

2470.68 --> 2474.4199999999996
it has become impossible

2477.099 --> 2482.38
the only reason why they haven't just

2479.5 --> 2485.94
straight out fried everybody

2482.38 --> 2490.599
is because the rules don't allow them to

2485.94 --> 2494.32
and thereby the rules stand Supreme

2490.599 --> 2496.7200000000003
the karmic rules of what allows them to

2494.32 --> 2499.6600000000003
basically torch

2496.72 --> 2501.7
or destroy something

2499.66 --> 2503.7
you have to have markers

2501.7 --> 2507.839
you have to have a certain

2503.7 --> 2511.4199999999996
accumulation of sin that is official

2507.839 --> 2514.9
and thereby I can also say that

2511.42 --> 2518.02
those people on Maui

2514.9 --> 2523.42
they were all heaped up together and

2518.02 --> 2525.64
marked as in they all had massive debt

2523.42 --> 2528.46
and exploitation

2525.64 --> 2530.14
and they were like obstructing Financial

2528.46 --> 2532.3
flow

2530.14 --> 2536.2
and thereby they have been marked and so

2532.3 --> 2539.44
they were marked for Destruction because

2536.2 --> 2541.2999999999997
they were obstructing the economy

2539.44 --> 2543.46
basically

2541.3 --> 2546.52
they were sitting on a high value spot

2543.46 --> 2548.859
and not doing anything with it but

2546.52 --> 2551.68
basically try to

2548.859 --> 2553.2999999999997
leech it financially that's what all

2551.68 --> 2555.7599999999998
they were doing and so they've been

2553.3 --> 2558.88
marked for Destruction and now you've

2555.76 --> 2562.3590000000004
seen what happens

2558.88 --> 2565.1400000000003
those are the rules guys

2562.359 --> 2565.14
do you understand

2565.359 --> 2573.2999999999997
that it's over

2567.94 --> 2577.3
we are now 100 subjected to the rules

2573.3 --> 2581.6800000000003
because the power that is available to

2577.3 --> 2584.1400000000003
enforce them is beyond control

2581.68 --> 2587.6189999999997
huh

2584.14 --> 2591.22
all that stands in the way of total

2587.619 --> 2593.44
human Annihilation overnight

2591.22 --> 2597.1189999999997
is the rules

2593.44 --> 2597.119
so you better figure them out

2602.079 --> 2606.6400000000003
keep the energy weapons I don't [ __ ]

2605.02 --> 2609.46
know dude

2606.64 --> 2613.0
I thought that it was like you required

2609.46 --> 2616.14
huge apparatus like a big machine for it

2613.0 --> 2619.0
or whatever but I think that maybe

2616.14 --> 2621.339
they've technologically developed them

2619.0 --> 2623.56
to the point where they can now like

2621.339 --> 2625.119
have a devastating

2623.56 --> 2628.54
block

2625.119 --> 2632.8
like City Block disintegrating weapon

2628.54 --> 2635.8
stuck to a simple drone at this point

2632.8 --> 2639.3390000000004
I don't [ __ ] know they might require

2635.8 --> 2643.0600000000004
like the bigger drone the more military

2639.339 --> 2645.64
strike drone that's been used a lot

2643.06 --> 2648.52
in the early 2000s and all that

2645.64 --> 2650.7999999999997
in in in the

2648.52 --> 2653.7599999999998
in the Middle East or

2650.8 --> 2656.619
even like a basic

2653.76 --> 2658.8390000000004
hover camera

2656.619 --> 2661.48
I don't know exactly

2658.839 --> 2664.06
you'd say it requires a lot of power but

2661.48 --> 2666.16
maybe it doesn't anymore

2664.06 --> 2668.5
maybe it doesn't require that amount of

2666.16 --> 2671.98
power maybe it just needs

2668.5 --> 2676.839
some kind of power to be present in the

2671.98 --> 2678.94
area and then it can like leech off that

2676.839 --> 2683.88
like there is power running it can just

2678.94 --> 2686.56
be in the vicinity tap into that current

2683.88 --> 2688.2400000000002
extract it and then use that to

2686.56 --> 2690.88
basically feed the directed energy

2688.24 --> 2692.7999999999997
weapon maybe they have that dude I don't

2690.88 --> 2694.599
[ __ ] know at this point anymore I

2692.8 --> 2696.6400000000003
just know

2694.599 --> 2701.44
if it's just

2696.64 --> 2705.22
casually being deployed for for the game

2701.44 --> 2707.14
based on the rules then we're all [ __ ]

2705.22 --> 2708.4599999999996
well we're not all complete like it's

2707.14 --> 2710.98
not doomed

2708.46 --> 2712.42
but you're subjected to the game and

2710.98 --> 2717.339
it's serious now

2712.42 --> 2721.96
that means sin really does become death

2717.339 --> 2724.24
and everybody like it's not just you

2721.96 --> 2726.76
it's everybody that surrounds you like

2724.24 --> 2729.52
if you let other people around you sin

2726.76 --> 2731.099
and bring the whole Community down or

2729.52 --> 2735.46
the whole location

2731.099 --> 2740.099
then you basically allow risk of total

2735.46 --> 2740.099
Annihilation onto yourself now

2747.06 --> 2751.14
it's become that serious

2753.77 --> 2758.92
[Music]

2755.92 --> 2762.099
and by the way similar [ __ ] is probably

2758.92 --> 2764.2000000000003
true about Greece

2762.099 --> 2767.319
as in Maui

2764.2 --> 2770.56
because those Greeks have the same type

2767.319 --> 2772.359
issues like it's very valuable but

2770.56 --> 2776.74
they're kind of poor

2772.359 --> 2780.339
they have lots and lots of that in

2776.74 --> 2783.4599999999996
Greece huge debtors

2780.339 --> 2787.119
so that they all burn down

2783.46 --> 2789.94
is only logical that they would be

2787.119 --> 2791.7400000000002
actively burned down

2789.94 --> 2793.66
by people

2791.74 --> 2796.18
is logical

2793.66 --> 2797.74
it's super criminal but it's logical

2796.18 --> 2801.96
because

2797.74 --> 2801.9599999999996
they are obstructing the economy

2802.0 --> 2810.54
so the Grapplers have to intervene

2806.02 --> 2810.54
like that's what BlackRock really does

2811.599 --> 2817.3
they seek out points where people throw

2814.359 --> 2820.2999999999997
their sin build up too much debt

2817.3 --> 2823.42
and obstruct the economy by

2820.3 --> 2826.3
owning valuable valuable land or

2823.42 --> 2828.579
whatever and not really exploiting it

2826.3 --> 2831.04
just trying to sit on it and leech off

2828.579 --> 2832.96
the value of it yeah that's what

2831.04 --> 2835.96
BlackRock Vanguard that's what they

2832.96 --> 2839.38
target they set it up and then they

2835.96 --> 2842.98
[ __ ] torch you all yeah so you think

2839.38 --> 2846.46
you can sit on a piece of value valuable

2842.98 --> 2849.339
land and not really do anything with it

2846.46 --> 2852.54
get ready to get roasted

2849.339 --> 2852.54
that's what's gonna happen

2855.66 --> 2861.7799999999997
one of the definitions of that is sin

2859.359 --> 2861.7799999999997
sure

2863.68 --> 2869.859
I'm just telling you out there oh oh my

2867.46 --> 2871.7200000000003
business plan is like oh I inherited

2869.859 --> 2875.38
very old land

2871.72 --> 2879.04
very valuable we I have Cottage

2875.38 --> 2881.1400000000003
I I chase everyone out with stick

2879.04 --> 2884.8
yeah yeah well

2881.14 --> 2887.68
you're not exploiting it

2884.8 --> 2892.02
it's valuable

2887.68 --> 2892.02
it blackrock's gonna get you

2899.26 --> 2905.44
and everybody will be like oh how dare

2902.26 --> 2907.7200000000003
you oh this is so in Humane oh yeah but

2905.44 --> 2910.5
yeah but it does keep the economy

2907.72 --> 2910.5
flowing yeah

2912.579 --> 2917.5600000000004
and that's really the thing that upholds

2915.579 --> 2922.26
everything

2917.56 --> 2922.2599999999998
that's that's what keeps it all going

2929.68 --> 2937.8999999999996
through my Russian vids of this is

2933.16 --> 2937.8999999999996
yeah sure Here We Go Again sure

2942.52 --> 2945.9
that's very cool

2946.78 --> 2951.5400000000004
I don't care I'm not I'm not doing blue

2956.44 --> 2963.819
I'd argue that Only Sinful [ __ ] were

2960.46 --> 2964.66
blue because well if you have a lot of

2963.819 --> 2967.599
sin

2964.66 --> 2971.2
then you might get targeted

2967.599 --> 2974.099
somehow in an event by the uws won't you

2971.2 --> 2980.04
so you'll be wearing blue so your blue

2974.099 --> 2980.04
is your confession of being a sinner

2992.8 --> 2999.8390000000004
so I can guarantee you it's going to be

2995.98 --> 2999.839
the the color of the grappler

3002.72 --> 3009.4199999999996
because if you have no sin you have no

3006.9 --> 3012.42
no need to fear

3009.42 --> 3012.42
d-e-ws

3016.44 --> 3021.3
not asking me to wear blue no I know I'm

3018.9 --> 3023.1600000000003
not saying that you are the it's just

3021.3 --> 3025.7000000000003
that I've been seeing it

3023.16 --> 3028.44
which it wears blue

3025.7 --> 3030.48
Peters is wearing blue

3028.44 --> 3033.9
like all these people are suddenly

3030.48 --> 3036.66
starting to wear blue and like you're a

3033.9 --> 3040.619
bunch of [ __ ]

3036.66 --> 3042.1189999999997
oh you got a lot of sin hidden burdening

3040.619 --> 3045.3
your soul

3042.119 --> 3048.9
you Fury the duw is gonna Target you

3045.3 --> 3051.38
yeah I don't fear the Dew is going to

3048.9 --> 3051.38
Target me

3060.599 --> 3067.28
it might if my entire city here turns to

3064.859 --> 3067.2799999999997
[ __ ]

3069.0 --> 3071.96
then it might

3073.92 --> 3078.9
and I'll be roasted with the rest of

3076.2 --> 3080.9399999999996
them but yeah too bad I mean oh I'm

3078.9 --> 3082.44
gonna wear blue like a [ __ ] fearful

3080.94 --> 3084.0
[ __ ]

3082.44 --> 3087.48
so that

3084.0 --> 3089.16
I can survive in a completely molten

3087.48 --> 3092.16
City

3089.16 --> 3092.16
yay

3104.579 --> 3111.3590000000004
and besides if I'm like sitting here

3108.839 --> 3114.54
and like the entire building starts

3111.359 --> 3117.2999999999997
igniting well I might not be igniting

3114.54 --> 3119.579
but I'm still gonna be standing in a

3117.3 --> 3123.02
burning building then so

3119.579 --> 3123.02
it's just ugh

3123.48 --> 3128.0
I'm just not gonna let it make me

3125.4 --> 3128.0
paranoid

3145.559 --> 3150.6800000000003
high density laser weeding with yeah

3148.079 --> 3150.6800000000003
I've seen those

3153.64 --> 3157.5899999999997
[Music]

3161.819 --> 3165.8
yeah it's interesting how that works

3174.72 --> 3179.22
brilliant Innovation by the way from the

3177.119 --> 3182.7000000000003
farmers

3179.22 --> 3184.3799999999997
I mean this I definitely think that this

3182.7 --> 3186.72
is

3184.38 --> 3190.92
I mean it's probably a bit expensive but

3186.72 --> 3194.04
very well worth it I mean to to avoid

3190.92 --> 3196.2200000000003
using herbicide and pesticide it's worth

3194.04 --> 3196.22
it

3202.5 --> 3206.46
right because yeah you have to have one

3205.079 --> 3209.46
of those things

3206.46 --> 3212.16
but then once you have that

3209.46 --> 3213.78
you literally like

3212.16 --> 3217.02
freeze

3213.78 --> 3219.3590000000004
the the declination or the yeah the

3217.02 --> 3221.88
degrading of your land

3219.359 --> 3224.2799999999997
from that point on it's like

3221.88 --> 3227.76
you never have to do any kind of like

3224.28 --> 3230.7200000000003
poison damage to the ground ever again

3227.76 --> 3230.7200000000003
so it's brilliant

3240.839 --> 3246.9
right but yeah maybe you could compare

3244.319 --> 3248.22
those weeding machine laser weeding

3246.9 --> 3252.059
machines

3248.22 --> 3253.98
to the DW and I mean

3252.059 --> 3256.7400000000002
to be fair

3253.98 --> 3257.88
yeah it's it is like sci-fi tyrannical

3256.74 --> 3260.3999999999996
but

3257.88 --> 3261.839
wouldn't it be something if you just

3260.4 --> 3264.3
like had it

3261.839 --> 3265.68
had those machines hanging up there and

3264.3 --> 3269.04
it's like

3265.68 --> 3272.22
there's a like a social credit system

3269.04 --> 3274.319
that not Chinese type but that keeps

3272.22 --> 3277.0789999999997
track of everything that you do and like

3274.319 --> 3279.66
once you crush across certain thresholds

3277.079 --> 3281.94
of sin you get warnings by the system

3279.66 --> 3283.2
like if you proceed then you will be

3281.94 --> 3285.9
terminated

3283.2 --> 3288.66
like not through people but like through

3285.9 --> 3290.819
the freaking robots and [ __ ]

3288.66 --> 3295.02
like

3290.819 --> 3299.339
help desk AI will just like emergency

3295.02 --> 3303.0
message if you continue this

3299.339 --> 3304.7999999999997
you will be targeted for extermination

3303.0 --> 3306.96
and then if you keep it up and you keep

3304.8 --> 3308.6600000000003
it up then it's eventually like a bunch

3306.96 --> 3313.339
of drums come down and it's just like

3308.66 --> 3313.339
and then you're just a bunch of Ashes

3313.94 --> 3318.059
Logan's Run no

3318.3 --> 3324.6600000000003
no not Age based Logan's Run is like oh

3322.44 --> 3327.66
nobody can grow old

3324.66 --> 3330.1189999999997
because of climate change yeah let's not

3327.66 --> 3332.16
[ __ ] deploy a device like that based

3330.119 --> 3335.6400000000003
on climate

3332.16 --> 3337.859
criteria that's [ __ ] up yeah

3335.64 --> 3340.74
if you want that then it's like oh let's

3337.859 --> 3342.9
just erase everybody then according to

3340.74 --> 3345.54
that standard and then everything can go

3342.9 --> 3347.52
to hell and then all the diversity of

3345.54 --> 3349.8
plants and species can all get lost

3347.52 --> 3352.44
because humans are no longer there to

3349.8 --> 3354.96
maintain a balance within nature so that

3352.44 --> 3357.9
it all bewilders and then like three

3354.96 --> 3360.42
quarters of all species just dies

3357.9 --> 3363.9
because humans are no longer there to

3360.42 --> 3367.38
like prevent them all from destroying

3363.9 --> 3368.579
each other because nature does that

3367.38 --> 3372.059
yeah

3368.579 --> 3375.7200000000003
it's all those that yeah that's why

3372.059 --> 3379.7400000000002
climate cultists

3375.72 --> 3382.9199999999996
are Marxist like and they are satanic

3379.74 --> 3386.04
they're anti-environmentalists

3382.92 --> 3388.26
all their objectives all everything that

3386.04 --> 3394.52
they want people to do

3388.26 --> 3394.5200000000004
results in the destruction of nature

3397.02 --> 3402.42
everything they do

3399.72 --> 3404.4599999999996
all their objectives right and yeah

3402.42 --> 3406.26
there's people in there that care a

3404.46 --> 3408.78
great deal for nature and they know like

3406.26 --> 3411.2400000000002
ah poison is bad

3408.78 --> 3413.1600000000003
get away from pesticides organic is

3411.24 --> 3415.02
better and yeah they know that because

3413.16 --> 3416.52
they learned that they grew up like

3415.02 --> 3419.7599999999998
learning that

3416.52 --> 3421.38
but the actual climate change agenda

3419.76 --> 3424.6800000000003
points

3421.38 --> 3427.44
they're nothing about that

3424.68 --> 3429.0589999999997
they have nothing to do with poison in

3427.44 --> 3433.7400000000002
the ground they don't address poison

3429.059 --> 3433.7400000000002
they go for freaking nitrogen

3435.72 --> 3440.64
it's not a poison that's like an

3438.54 --> 3442.5589999999997
essential

3440.64 --> 3445.74
part

3442.559 --> 3447.48
for plant life to be able to grow so

3445.74 --> 3450.359
they're basically attacking plant life

3447.48 --> 3453.599
first they go after the carbon which is

3450.359 --> 3457.44
critically essential for plant life

3453.599 --> 3459.54
to have that they flourish more carbon

3457.44 --> 3461.88
dioxide more plant growth this is

3459.54 --> 3463.5589999999997
scientifically proven

3461.88 --> 3466.38
right

3463.559 --> 3468.42
and then the nitrogen also an important

3466.38 --> 3473.1800000000003
component for plant growth so it seems

3468.42 --> 3476.94
like the climate agenda is dead on

3473.18 --> 3481.0789999999997
attacking nature

3476.94 --> 3484.14
plant life is being attacked by the

3481.079 --> 3488.42
climate agenda direct assault on plant

3484.14 --> 3488.42
life that's what they're doing

3491.52 --> 3497.339
you don't get

3493.5 --> 3500.88
like carbon penalties

3497.339 --> 3502.7999999999997
right when you dump a bunch of poison in

3500.88 --> 3504.6600000000003
the river you might get like

3502.8 --> 3506.7000000000003
Environmental

3504.66 --> 3509.7599999999998
agencies after you because yeah it's

3506.7 --> 3512.9399999999996
forbidden right which you don't get like

3509.76 --> 3518.0400000000004
fines climb it finds no no no because

3512.94 --> 3521.9
they don't give a [ __ ] about nature

3518.04 --> 3521.9
their policies only

3523.38 --> 3530.819
are involved or involved only

3529.04 --> 3533.819
carbon

3530.819 --> 3533.819
methane

3533.94 --> 3538.26
nitrogen all the all those things that

3536.7 --> 3541.14
are like

3538.26 --> 3544.0200000000004
very common around

3541.14 --> 3546.9
like that happens in nature without

3544.02 --> 3550.2599999999998
man's intervention and they're all

3546.9 --> 3551.1600000000003
critical critically involved in plant

3550.26 --> 3554.7000000000003
life

3551.16 --> 3556.14
it's its own internal

3554.7 --> 3559.14
uh

3556.14 --> 3561.18
ecological cycle right that's what they

3559.14 --> 3564.359
care about they don't give a [ __ ]

3561.18 --> 3567.1189999999997
if you just throw poison or use pests

3564.359 --> 3571.74
like data you don't get carbon credit

3567.119 --> 3574.319
fine [ __ ] for using pesticides okay

3571.74 --> 3577.4399999999996
okay can we be clear

3574.319 --> 3579.9
that climate cultists are not

3577.44 --> 3581.46
environmentalists

3579.9 --> 3584.04
there rather

3581.46 --> 3587.76
anti-environmentalists

3584.04 --> 3590.819
that's why those cultists

3587.76 --> 3592.1600000000003
actually get involved with political

3590.819 --> 3595.74
stunts

3592.16 --> 3597.72
burning down nature

3595.74 --> 3600.5589999999997
for their political

3597.72 --> 3600.5589999999997
advantages

3601.26 --> 3606.0
yeah because they're not

3603.66 --> 3609.66
environmentalists

3606.0 --> 3609.66
they're anti-environmentalists

3610.799 --> 3616.68
they're Marxist

3613.22 --> 3619.319
pretending to save nature but they're

3616.68 --> 3622.2
actually assaulting it

3619.319 --> 3624.5
and by assaulting it they attack all

3622.2 --> 3624.5
life

3625.079 --> 3628.88
that's what's really going on

3628.92 --> 3633.42
and that's why it shouldn't take too

3631.5 --> 3635.579
long

3633.42 --> 3636.7200000000003
it really shouldn't like this must

3635.579 --> 3639.96
happen

3636.72 --> 3642.4199999999996
that these climate change cultists and

3639.96 --> 3643.44
everything that's involved with them

3642.42 --> 3645.119
should

3643.44 --> 3648.119
become

3645.119 --> 3648.119
illegal

3648.9 --> 3658.2000000000003
and considered a terrorist organization

3655.5 --> 3660.839
with terrorist motives

3658.2 --> 3665.22
and terrorist actions

3660.839 --> 3669.5
and terrorist damage that they do

3665.22 --> 3669.5
this should not be taking too long

3671.28 --> 3676.6400000000003
I really hope

3673.619 --> 3676.6400000000003
the big men

3676.98 --> 3682.64
like the bricks and all that are gonna

3678.78 --> 3682.6400000000003
get on to that first off

3682.92 --> 3687.0
I mean the United States is not going to

3684.78 --> 3690.619
do that they literally invented it they

3687.0 --> 3690.619
invented this climate cultism

3690.9 --> 3697.2000000000003
it's their little communist tool

3694.68 --> 3700.04
the crypto communist Empire the United

3697.2 --> 3700.04
States of America

3704.4 --> 3709.079
but the rest of the world needs to

3706.38 --> 3711.9
reject it

3709.079 --> 3713.1600000000003
and declare it terrorists because that's

3711.9 --> 3716.96
what it is

3713.16 --> 3716.96
it doesn't help the environment

3717.359 --> 3723.2599999999998
it destroys the environment and it

3720.18 --> 3723.2599999999998
destroys all life

3725.88 --> 3732.6800000000003
they're literally a doomsday cult

3730.619 --> 3735.78
yeah

3732.68 --> 3738.24
and a lot of these crazy cultists

3735.78 --> 3740.76
climate cultists they don't even believe

3738.24 --> 3744.54
that they can actually

3740.76 --> 3746.88
stop the thing that they fear the end of

3744.54 --> 3750.0
the world they eventually literally

3746.88 --> 3752.2200000000003
become Doom called This and like embrace

3750.0 --> 3756.2
it they're like yes end of the world

3752.22 --> 3756.2
we're gonna make it happen

3757.02 --> 3765.44
that's how they get people to literally

3761.46 --> 3765.44
burn down villages

3766.26 --> 3772.38
because it's not it eventually it isn't

3770.339 --> 3774.5
about saving the world anymore to

3772.38 --> 3777.839
prevent it it is just

3774.5 --> 3779.7
revenge for what you think is inevitable

3777.839 --> 3780.96
it's just burn them all down they

3779.7 --> 3783.48
deserve it

3780.96 --> 3786.42
because they didn't do anything

3783.48 --> 3788.94
for this virtual catastrophe

3786.42 --> 3792.66
that is inevitable

3788.94 --> 3796.099
and that we are effectively creating by

3792.66 --> 3796.0989999999997
assuming it is inevitable

3798.0 --> 3803.24
it's a Marxist trick it's a Marxist mind

3800.88 --> 3803.2400000000002
trick

3817.559 --> 3822.7400000000002
okay Shaka yeah but thanks for looking

3819.599 --> 3822.7400000000002
that up that's a good point

3824.88 --> 3829.52
anyway I'm gonna

3826.38 --> 3829.52
take a bite of this

3835.619 --> 3837.799
foreign

3870.84 --> 3873.9190000000003
[Music]

3876.98 --> 3880.039
[Music]

3902.15 --> 3904.86
[Music]

3903.359 --> 3907.989
thank you

3904.86 --> 3907.989
[Music]

3908.579 --> 3911.2400000000002
foreign

3938.36 --> 3941.51
[Music]

3946.859 --> 3949.799
like

3949.42 --> 3951.799
[Music]

3949.799 --> 3951.799
um

3954.799 --> 3959.0
I've heard recently that

3961.799 --> 3966.96
that they actually want to like really

3963.96 --> 3969.54
punish people who criticize climate

3966.96 --> 3972.18
change and [ __ ] like that's been

3969.54 --> 3974.579
roll out with European rules and all

3972.18 --> 3978.6189999999997
that [ __ ] but I really wonder like

3974.579 --> 3978.619
is that actually going to apply

3981.3 --> 3984.53
[Music]

3984.599 --> 3989.4
because I kind of want to put this in

3987.119 --> 3992.819
the title yeah climate change activism

3989.4 --> 3996.359
is anti-life Terrorism

3992.819 --> 3998.16
but I might get into trouble for that

3996.359 --> 4001.0
what do you guys think

3998.16 --> 4001.0
hello what's up

4007.819 --> 4011.44
uh no

4011.539 --> 4015.3390000000004
no you get the [ __ ] out of here

4018.559 --> 4024.26
there's no hello what's up old person

4022.039 --> 4025.76
that literally created their account

4024.26 --> 4027.26
today yeah

4025.76 --> 4028.579
no

4027.26 --> 4032.619
no

4028.579 --> 4032.619
you just get the [ __ ] out of here

4033.02 --> 4039.559
yeah you don't get a place in my chat

4036.52 --> 4042.5
you're not my chat participant

4039.559 --> 4045.3190000000004
stop trying to get into my chat with

4042.5 --> 4047.0
your [ __ ] sock trolls pretending like

4045.319 --> 4049.66
you've always been there

4047.0 --> 4049.66
foreign

4085.16 --> 4090.16
I mean is that unreasonable of me guys

4095.42 --> 4099.859
am I being unreasonable somebody comes

4098.12 --> 4102.08
in here with the generic name like

4099.859 --> 4107.14
what's up

4102.08 --> 4107.14
with an account made today and just says

4123.98 --> 4129.919999999999

4129.92 --> 4134.56

4156.739 --> 4162.0199999999995

4158.12 --> 4165.16
act Pleasant to try to not be ousted

it's an infiltrator

4187.06 --> 4192.64

4190.46 --> 4192.64

then being able to correct it after

4323.48 --> 4328.159
you're done

4325.699 --> 4330.199

4330.199 --> 4334.759999999999

4352.1 --> 4354.6990000000005

or maybe just Sinners I mean that is

4509.9 --> 4515.5599999999995
technically a sin according to

4513.02 --> 4515.56
you guys

4523.219 --> 4526.54
if it's not yeah

4528.44 --> 4535.36
not depth Sinners is better because it's

4531.38 --> 4535.36
not other types of sin necessarily

4549.679 --> 4553.42
are you guys enjoying the show

4555.44 --> 4558.44

hmm

4632.3 --> 4635.399
[Music]

4652.34 --> 4656.96
all right anyway so that's how I'm gonna

4654.32 --> 4660.0199999999995
look at the news now anytime there's

4656.96 --> 4661.219
like oh fire I'm gonna like do research

4660.02 --> 4662.84
on

4661.219 --> 4666.14
who was that

4662.84 --> 4668.659000000001
I'm no longer going to assume that

4666.14 --> 4670.76
fires are just there to burn down

4668.659 --> 4673.0
innocent people I'm not gonna assume

4670.76 --> 4673.0
that anymore

4673.64 --> 4679.900000000001
I don't think that's in accordance with

4675.98 --> 4679.9
like the karmic laws with the game

4682.76 --> 4686.8
I think they can only

4687.159 --> 4693.799999999999
burn down

4689.3 --> 4697.52
debtors that are sitting on

4693.8 --> 4700.76
valuable Commodities land

4697.52 --> 4704.2390000000005
and not exploiting them basically just

4700.76 --> 4706.6990000000005
sitting of them trying to leech off the

4704.239 --> 4708.739
value financially and thereby

4706.699 --> 4712.839999999999
obstructing the economy I think that

4708.739 --> 4712.839999999999
those are the targets of this

4712.94 --> 4717.739
people that do that oh you did it for

4715.94 --> 4720.4
Generations well guess what they're

4717.739 --> 4720.4
coming for you

4722.84 --> 4726.1
that's what I predicted

4747.89 --> 4753.6
[Music]

4754.34 --> 4757.28
I don't know what the [ __ ] you're

4756.02 --> 4761.540000000001
talking about

4757.28 --> 4764.5
it be 23 it makes no [ __ ] sense you

4761.54 --> 4764.5
sound like a bot

4779.36 --> 4781.96
beautiful

4797.9 --> 4804.799999999999
candle is infused I don't care might be

4802.46 --> 4806.719
I don't know man they allow all kinds of

4804.8 --> 4808.659000000001
[ __ ] out for your day literally just

4806.719 --> 4812.06
allow

4808.659 --> 4813.739
hallucinogenic [ __ ] now

4812.06 --> 4817.3
they like

4813.739 --> 4819.919999999999
you can like buy legally buy

4817.3 --> 4823.1
ecstasy here

4819.92 --> 4824.78
yeah what's the chemical name like I

4823.1 --> 4827.54
don't get it like I don't understand

4824.78 --> 4830.44
this country anymore it's like

4827.54 --> 4830.44
creepy

4835.1 --> 4838.84
MDMA yeah that's the one

4849.32 --> 4853.179
that's crazy yeah it is

4867.44 --> 4873.86
working on it and hey to a certain

4870.739 --> 4875.299999999999
extent I am all for the legalization of

4873.86 --> 4878.96
drugs

4875.3 --> 4881.42
or condolence policy because I apps it

4878.96 --> 4883.719
can never be you can't advertise that

4881.42 --> 4883.719
[ __ ]

4884.12 --> 4889.159
you can't like advertise or even like

4886.219 --> 4893.06
tell everybody like hey we got these

4889.159 --> 4895.339999999999
drugs like no

4893.06 --> 4897.14
don't do that

4895.34 --> 4899.6
that shouldn't be legal I don't even

4897.14 --> 4901.58
like that with alcohol

4899.6 --> 4904.58
I don't even think alcohol should be

4901.58 --> 4906.44
advertised in public it's bad enough

4904.58 --> 4910.76
that we get like

4906.44 --> 4912.739
internet and television ads of that

4910.76 --> 4914.4800000000005
I don't want to see that on posters

4912.739 --> 4915.98
outside I don't think that should be

4914.48 --> 4918.199
allowed

4915.98 --> 4920.599999999999
and the same goes for any drugs but I'm

4918.199 --> 4923.719
like yeah sure what you want

4920.6 --> 4926.4800000000005
the One Like Cocaine all that [ __ ] yeah

4923.719 --> 4929.42
it's it's garbage it's not good for you

4926.48 --> 4933.339999999999
but if you make it illegal then crime

4929.42 --> 4933.34
just gets more money out of it

4934.699 --> 4940.419999999999
and there's going to be more damage

4938.48 --> 4943.4
like they're gonna be duking it out

4940.42 --> 4947.5
shooting each other and [ __ ] over the

4943.4 --> 4947.5
turf or whatever right so

4948.56 --> 4953.780000000001
in a way I was even when I was younger

4951.14 --> 4955.820000000001
it's like yeah legalized do do that but

4953.78 --> 4956.96
be very careful on how you're gonna do

4955.82 --> 4959.259999999999
it though

4956.96 --> 4962.12
it's not so much legalized as

4959.26 --> 4965.02
decriminalized make sure that crime just

4962.12 --> 4969.099999999999
doesn't have power because of it

4965.02 --> 4969.1
that's how I like to see it

4969.56 --> 4975.38
right it's all about decriminalization

4972.08 --> 4979.659
make sure that crime doesn't

4975.38 --> 4979.659000000001
get power out of it

4982.46 --> 4988.88
but that doesn't mean oh let's just

4984.56 --> 4991.34
industrially promote drugs to people

4988.88 --> 4995.56
absolutely not

4991.34 --> 4995.56
it should never be normalized

4999.98 --> 5005.259999999999
right but it it's like decriminalized

5003.52 --> 5006.820000000001
same as with cannabis it's like yeah

5005.26 --> 5008.08
make sure there's no more criminality

5006.82 --> 5012.28
involved

5008.08 --> 5016.719
good rules balances checks

5012.28 --> 5019.0599999999995
but no like corporate exploitation that

5016.719 --> 5022.659
part is really important like it can't

5019.06 --> 5025.6
be like an exploitable

5022.659 --> 5028.0
commercially exploitable thing with

5025.6 --> 5030.96
advertisement

5028.0 --> 5030.96
and all that

5034.0 --> 5040.0
because like there shouldn't be

5036.76 --> 5041.7390000000005
advertisement for drugs ever

5040.0 --> 5044.26
I don't even I think there shouldn't

5041.739 --> 5048.879999999999
even be advertisement for pharmaceutical

5044.26 --> 5050.92
drugs I think that should be illegal

5048.88 --> 5055.3
completely

5050.92 --> 5058.42
yeah all forms of drugs

5055.3 --> 5062.5
where do they come from a subscription

5058.42 --> 5064.9
or through the the supermarket

5062.5 --> 5066.94
should not be allowed to have

5064.9 --> 5068.5
advertisement

5066.94 --> 5071.5599999999995
like that

5068.5 --> 5074.98
I mean advertisement in the store sure

5071.56 --> 5076.780000000001
advertisement in store brochures right

5074.98 --> 5081.879999999999
that sort of thing sure

5076.78 --> 5084.4
but not in your face on the street side

5081.88 --> 5087.2390000000005
and and really not on television either

5084.4 --> 5087.239
I think

5089.56 --> 5094.080000000001
weed is all natural mostly yeah

5096.82 --> 5099.639999999999
so yeah

5098.04 --> 5104.32
decriminalization

5099.64 --> 5107.62
but don't make it legal to like make ads

5104.32 --> 5110.98
don't make it legal to seduce Outsiders

5107.62 --> 5114.659
that don't know about it into trying it

5110.98 --> 5114.659
that should be illegal

5116.5 --> 5121.42
and then you can have a pretty decent

5119.26 --> 5122.92
world with that people could try their

5121.42 --> 5127.3
drugs

5122.92 --> 5129.88
regret it not regret it move on

5127.3 --> 5131.8
not get into criminal trouble

5129.88 --> 5135.219
right with it

5131.8 --> 5139.06
not end up like going into criminal

5135.219 --> 5141.58
activity to provide for their drug habit

5139.06 --> 5143.56
because it's not that expensive because

5141.58 --> 5145.9
it's not illegal

5143.56 --> 5148.3
so that criminals can really open the

5145.9 --> 5153.0599999999995
price because of their risk

5148.3 --> 5153.06
yeah it's all better that way

5161.199 --> 5166.178999999999
right but there should be very strict

5164.26 --> 5168.159000000001
rules about it though like with the

5166.179 --> 5169.6
advertisement it's like that's a serious

5168.159 --> 5172.719
deal

5169.6 --> 5175.96
you can't just advertise publicly for

5172.719 --> 5179.86
for hard drugs or something

5175.96 --> 5183.06
like not even to let everybody know it's

5179.86 --> 5183.0599999999995
legal and you can get it

5183.1 --> 5187.84
it shouldn't be in the publics you

5185.98 --> 5190.0
shouldn't like wander around and bump

5187.84 --> 5191.7390000000005
into that

5190.0 --> 5195.719
just as much as you shouldn't be

5191.739 --> 5195.718999999999
wandering around and then bumping into

5195.76 --> 5200.9800000000005
what do you call that bump into a

5198.34 --> 5203.1990000000005
Streaker right

5200.98 --> 5207.0
well you shouldn't bump into a sudden

5203.199 --> 5207.0
advertisement for hard drugs either

5212.32 --> 5219.159
but it's it's good if it's

5215.62 --> 5222.099999999999
like decriminalized that it is available

5219.159 --> 5225.46
and checked like that to ensure that

5222.1 --> 5227.1990000000005
it's not like poison or whatever or to

5225.46 --> 5230.26
cut costs because that's what criminals

5227.199 --> 5233.08
do too right to cut costs they mix in

5230.26 --> 5235.12
garbage and sometimes that garbage is

5233.08 --> 5236.98
actually very bad for you they don't

5235.12 --> 5239.08
care because they get the short-term

5236.98 --> 5241.839999999999
profit and nobody checks you because

5239.08 --> 5244.659
it's all illegal anyway right

5241.84 --> 5249.6
you bypass all those types of issues

5244.659 --> 5249.599999999999
which is what gets people killed

5250.0 --> 5255.04
yeah drug users get killed because

5253.3 --> 5256.900000000001
criminals

5255.04 --> 5259.719
they don't know have nobody to check

5256.9 --> 5261.82
them and they just mix in Poison one day

5259.719 --> 5264.219
or whatever they might not even realize

5261.82 --> 5266.92
how dangerous that is and they get

5264.219 --> 5268.36
people killed and it's like oh oops well

5266.92 --> 5271.659
nobody cares

5268.36 --> 5274.299999999999
because it's all illegal anyway

5271.659 --> 5278.199
right well if you decriminalize that

5274.3 --> 5280.06
sort of thing is no longer gonna happen

5278.199 --> 5282.219
the worst that might happen is that

5280.06 --> 5284.620000000001
somebody ODS because they're just

5282.219 --> 5287.62
completely irresponsible they just take

5284.62 --> 5290.76
too much of something that is should be

5287.62 --> 5290.76
safe enough

5292.12 --> 5298.39
that's the worst you'll get out of that

5295.34 --> 5298.39
[Music]

5299.5 --> 5301.679
right

5308.56 --> 5313.780000000001
yeah but yeah advertisement agencies

5312.04 --> 5316.719
have become

5313.78 --> 5321.48
just devil agencies they're just there

5316.719 --> 5321.4800000000005
how do we mind control and seduce people

5322.6 --> 5328.780000000001
turn them into zombie slaves I mean it's

5325.48 --> 5332.159
become really bad advertisement agencies

5328.78 --> 5332.159
really really bad

5341.08 --> 5347.22
You could argue that advertisement

5343.36 --> 5348.639
agencies are are worse than Hollywood

5347.22 --> 5351.900000000001
[Music]

5348.639 --> 5351.900000000001
which is quite a stretch

5356.26 --> 5362.34
start

5357.82 --> 5362.34
no that's not the right way to say that

5362.679 --> 5367.4800000000005
it's quite a way to go it's a better way

5365.26 --> 5369.58
to describe that

5367.48 --> 5371.44
because we all know how far how [ __ ]

5369.58 --> 5375.159
up Hollywood can be well the

5371.44 --> 5378.28
advertisement agents are arguably worse

5375.159 --> 5381.9
like they're up front and pushy about

5378.28 --> 5381.9
their nasty manipulation

5382.36 --> 5386.5199999999995
like way worse than Hollywood

5389.38 --> 5395.56
the devil industries that always have

5391.96 --> 5398.08
been yeah yeah kind of

5395.56 --> 5402.06
they were always a bit

5398.08 --> 5402.0599999999995
but now that just [ __ ] gross

5403.42 --> 5409.36
and I mean people genuinely hate

5406.179 --> 5411.6990000000005
advertisement now it's no longer um sick

5409.36 --> 5413.08
of it now they like people's like we

5411.699 --> 5415.719
hate you

5413.08 --> 5417.5199999999995
like every time an ad plays people start

5415.719 --> 5422.699
to go like this like

5417.52 --> 5422.6990000000005
it's like we [ __ ] hate these ads now

5434.639 --> 5438.179
resurrected Babylon

5441.04 --> 5443.94
meh

5470.44 --> 5474.699
what

5472.239 --> 5477.54
that's [ __ ] up slow mo moon buggy

5474.699 --> 5477.54
seriously

5485.56 --> 5489.54
as a Revenge wow

5503.739 --> 5505.919999999999
wow

5506.679 --> 5511.56
it gets worse whoa

5509.62 --> 5515.82
okay

5511.56 --> 5515.820000000001
I thought it was already pretty bad

5542.86 --> 5548.648999999999
[Music]

5545.51 --> 5548.649
[Applause]

5574.239 --> 5577.08
hmm

5586.0 --> 5589.0
foreign

5608.679 --> 5611.76
sounds messed up

5655.43 --> 5660.400000000001
[Music]

5657.4 --> 5660.4
foreign

5721.12 --> 5725.32
right so

5724.12 --> 5729.12
yeah

5725.32 --> 5729.12
Today's show was pretty decent

5731.08 --> 5733.8
thoughts

5735.58 --> 5740.38
I mean my expertise really stops at ads

5738.4 --> 5743.739
though because

5740.38 --> 5746.159000000001
I've like severely hated ads since my

5743.739 --> 5746.159
teens

5746.62 --> 5752.8
like I'm one of those guys that when it

5749.32 --> 5754.54
an ad comes up I start like yelling back

5752.8 --> 5756.76
at it

5754.54 --> 5758.8
the Owen Benjamin does that too right

5756.76 --> 5761.4400000000005
away like he's playing some video and

5758.8 --> 5764.679
then it's some oh and he's like oh [ __ ]

5761.44 --> 5767.219
I gotta get [ __ ] I'm and I'm so like

5764.679 --> 5767.219
that too

5768.52 --> 5774.6
like get out of my face is usually what

5772.179 --> 5774.6
I say

5782.4 --> 5788.94
DNS

5784.08 --> 5788.94
okay fair enough Dr woodgar

5789.699 --> 5795.96
well ads are part of my income through

5793.6 --> 5795.96
YouTube

5799.56 --> 5805.96
and well despite ads like we know it

5803.5 --> 5808.239
sucks I still like to keep track of what

5805.96 --> 5811.84
they're trying

5808.239 --> 5814.799999999999
if not just to know how other people are

5811.84 --> 5814.8
being manipulated

5817.54 --> 5824.639
right as as to not become too alienated

5821.08 --> 5824.639
for what's going around

5826.78 --> 5830.32
doesn't mean you have to like it

5828.94 --> 5832.839999999999
Dido

5830.32 --> 5834.94
but it's still good to keep track of

5832.84 --> 5838.08
basically the level of manipulation

5834.94 --> 5838.08
that's happening out there

5839.92 --> 5844.78
right anyway

5842.56 --> 5847.679
I'm taking a two minute break

5844.78 --> 5847.679
we'll be right back

5894.4 --> 5897.4
foreign

5946.239 --> 5949.239
foreign

5965.38 --> 5968.400000000001
what's this

5970.28 --> 5975.33
[Music]

5979.41 --> 5982.54
[Music]

5993.58 --> 5996.54
what the [ __ ]

6004.8 --> 6007.9400000000005
that is weird

6009.12 --> 6015.599999999999
I've never seen that one by the way

6012.48 --> 6018.36
but it's super weird

6015.6 --> 6021.54
I know what you like it shouldn't be

6018.36 --> 6024.259999999999
creepy but it is creepy that's just

6021.54 --> 6024.26
weird man

6025.44 --> 6030.259999999999
and it reminds me of Rosemary's Baby or

6028.08 --> 6030.26
something

6035.639 --> 6039.86
or The Exorcist move yeah perhaps

6042.06 --> 6046.139
weird

6043.38 --> 6050.54
very very weird

6046.139 --> 6050.54
oh hold on that's probably my package

6079.32 --> 6082.32
foreign

6097.38 --> 6099.619
foreign

6106.51 --> 6109.569
[Music]

6151.52 --> 6154.52
thank you

6155.88 --> 6160.139
right so now I'm probably gonna end up

6158.28 --> 6163.139
riding out the show

6160.139 --> 6163.139
hmm

6168.239 --> 6172.678999999999
what's the delivery oh it's just more

6171.0 --> 6175.639
salt

6172.679 --> 6175.639
black Crystal

6176.82 --> 6179.96
being a lot of those

6180.48 --> 6185.879999999999
duties in the mail yeah

6183.78 --> 6188.28
I mean it's a lot cheaper actually

6185.88 --> 6190.58
ordering it like this than to buy it in

6188.28 --> 6190.58
stores

6201.239 --> 6206.638999999999
yeah and thank God I'm not like like I

6204.119 --> 6209.28
was when I was a team when if I'd have

6206.639 --> 6211.26
that much candy I'd literally start

6209.28 --> 6212.94
chugging it when I was younger that was

6211.26 --> 6216.139
really problematic

6212.94 --> 6220.04
now I know how to not do that

6216.139 --> 6220.04
I'm very glad of that

6221.159 --> 6225.619
oh

6222.96 --> 6225.619
yeah

6229.8 --> 6233.52
yeah it's weird isn't it cheaper

6231.42 --> 6236.34
delivered at home but it's also because

6233.52 --> 6239.1
of the the amount of it I mean you're

6236.34 --> 6241.679
not gonna buy like a whole package of it

6239.1 --> 6243.119000000001
in the store you're gonna buy singular

6241.679 --> 6246.0
rolls

6243.119 --> 6250.099999999999
but if you buy it with like the whole

6246.0 --> 6250.1
package it's always going to be cheaper

6255.0 --> 6261.98
cat comes by like hey can you feed me

6258.06 --> 6261.9800000000005
now uh no

6272.28 --> 6276.619
the warehouse is cheaper than a store

6274.139 --> 6276.619
yeah

6290.4 --> 6295.199
right and that's what makes Walmart so

6292.98 --> 6296.94
cheap is that it is basically a

6295.199 --> 6299.119
warehouse that kind of doubles as a

6296.94 --> 6299.119
store

6301.8 --> 6304.9400000000005
it really is

6328.8 --> 6334.08
that's salesman in media mark

6331.44 --> 6336.86
telling you to order yeah

6334.08 --> 6336.86
me too

6337.38 --> 6342.84
but seriously like I go to a store for

6340.08 --> 6345.139
like Electronics to kind of see what's

6342.84 --> 6345.139
around

6348.659 --> 6352.5599999999995
because sometimes when you just go

6350.699 --> 6355.619
browsing

6352.56 --> 6357.900000000001
with online pictures you're not really

6355.619 --> 6360.0599999999995
you don't really get the feel of it too

6357.9 --> 6362.5199999999995
much

6360.06 --> 6366.4800000000005
and that's why it's good to like see it

6362.52 --> 6368.52
in 3D in the real world sometime

6366.48 --> 6371.5199999999995
and then once you've seen that you can

6368.52 --> 6374.639
compare that to what you're going to see

6371.52 --> 6376.860000000001
online and to get a better

6374.639 --> 6379.46
ability the size of what you're actually

6376.86 --> 6379.46
looking at

6379.86 --> 6387.259999999999
demo shops exactly but they should be I

6382.92 --> 6387.26
mean that's there's not bad to do that

6398.3 --> 6404.400000000001
let's do it and before you know it

6401.639 --> 6407.159000000001
there will be like demo stores with like

6404.4 --> 6412.0199999999995
Holograms of the products

6407.159 --> 6414.239
so it's like you you go to a store

6412.02 --> 6415.9800000000005
where you can have a demonstration but

6414.239 --> 6418.259999999999
not even buy the product it's it's

6415.98 --> 6421.08
basically like a demo shop what you say

6418.26 --> 6424.7390000000005
where it's like oh the new phone

6421.08 --> 6428.159
and then you get to see

6424.739 --> 6431.58
like the 3D model of it

6428.159 --> 6434.339999999999
and on a screen a demonstration of how

6431.58 --> 6437.28
to use it or something

6434.34 --> 6440.28
and then if you like it you can order it

6437.28 --> 6442.82
to be delivered at your home

6440.28 --> 6442.82
like that

6449.94 --> 6453.48
because if you're gonna have actual

6451.679 --> 6456.42
models the physical thing you're gonna

6453.48 --> 6459.619
also have to have like a store keeper

6456.42 --> 6462.8
to keep track of all that I don't know

6459.619 --> 6466.199
thinking out loud I'm not sure

6462.8 --> 6469.5
but I've always liked retail

6466.199 --> 6473.638999999999
because then you can literally see it in

6469.5 --> 6476.34
3D and and like feel it in your hand

6473.639 --> 6479.52
feel the clicky clicky like what type of

6476.34 --> 6481.860000000001
clicky clicky is it very important

6479.52 --> 6483.4800000000005
right you don't feel that when you buy

6481.86 --> 6486.119
something online

6483.48 --> 6489.44
might be cheaper but you don't know

6486.119 --> 6489.44
exactly what you're gonna get

6491.159 --> 6496.379999999999
right anyway I'm rounding out the show

6494.1 --> 6498.360000000001
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6496.38 --> 6500.82
like this show if you did then please

6498.36 --> 6502.799999999999
don't forget the rogans it up and if you

6500.82 --> 6505.32
haven't already subscribe to my channel

6502.8 --> 6507.360000000001
hit the Bell notification so you know

6505.32 --> 6510.0599999999995
when I'm going live which is normally

6507.36 --> 6512.219
1pm Amsterdam time in a weekdays and 2PM

6510.06 --> 6514.679
Amsterdam time in a weekend and please

6512.219 --> 6516.36
also do support me through the PayPal

6514.679 --> 6518.82
and the patreon that'll be much

6516.36 --> 6520.38
appreciated and you can always use the

6518.82 --> 6522.42
support please keep it coming I'm gonna

6520.38 --> 6524.28
need it

6522.42 --> 6526.5
coming month is going to be kind of

6524.28 --> 6528.599999999999
tough

6526.5 --> 6530.82
I think

6528.6 --> 6534.2390000000005
unless the government like throws me

6530.82 --> 6536.099999999999
another like uh compensation check for

6534.239 --> 6538.5
all the insane pricings

6536.1 --> 6540.06
which is really necessary because like

6538.5 --> 6541.98
basic

6540.06 --> 6544.9800000000005
welfare that's constitutionally

6541.98 --> 6546.0599999999995
guaranteed like is not really sufficient

6544.98 --> 6548.28
anymore

6546.06 --> 6549.6
because of just the pricing of

6548.28 --> 6551.58
everything

6549.6 --> 6553.08
so they're probably going to standardize

6551.58 --> 6556.739
that eventually

6553.08 --> 6559.98
unless they manage to roll back the

6556.739 --> 6561.959999999999
insane power prices which are still

6559.98 --> 6564.659
terrible I mean it's

6561.96 --> 6568.679
it's doing a lot of damage the power

6564.659 --> 6572.159
prices here a lot of damage

6568.679 --> 6572.159
anyway ah

6573.84 --> 6577.34
I'll be back tomorrow with flat Earth

6575.699 --> 6580.619
early bird number

6577.34 --> 6582.0
706 on a Thursday

6580.619 --> 6584.099999999999
and I'm going to join the Flat Earth

6582.0 --> 6586.08
debates over Nathan Oakley 1980 Channel

6584.1 --> 6588.42
which just now started up hope to see

6586.08 --> 6592.17
you there in the chat and until the next

6588.42 --> 6623.47
video keep it flat

6592.17 --> 6623.47
