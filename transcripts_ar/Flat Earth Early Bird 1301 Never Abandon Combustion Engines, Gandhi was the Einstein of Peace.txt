[Music]

104.96 --> 108.17999999999999
right the weather today is

107.52 --> 110.79899999999999
hot

108.18 --> 112.72000000000001
[Music]

110.799 --> 115.119
it's not a lot of wind i think it's

112.72 --> 116.719
probably because of that just this very

115.119 --> 118.88
slow breeze

116.719 --> 121.19999999999999
uh there is

118.88 --> 123.439
a giant amount of trailing going on up

121.2 --> 123.43900000000001
there

123.52 --> 127.67999999999999
it's like

124.799 --> 130.11
a giant grid

127.68 --> 133.269
of trails up there right now

130.11 --> 133.269
[Music]

134.64 --> 138.599
probably make that out

144.8 --> 148.08
all right but

145.92 --> 151.16
it doesn't actually seem to help against

148.08 --> 151.16000000000003
the heat

156.91 --> 165.28
[Music]

160.56 --> 165.28
because it's 27 degrees celsius

168.72 --> 175.04
right anyway

171.599 --> 176.959
hello cleary first in chat turret 306.

175.04 --> 183.07999999999998
good to see you

176.959 --> 183.08
this tuesday the 12th of july 2022

194.239 --> 197.64000000000001
weird issues

212.56 --> 216.48
right so it's it's really hot in a room

214.72 --> 219.68
right now the sun is still

216.48 --> 222.879
getting inside so yeah it might be

219.68 --> 222.87900000000002
like taking a break

223.44 --> 227.2
just go downstairs where it's a little

225.519 --> 228.4
cooler

227.2 --> 231.11999999999998
like within

228.4 --> 234.159
the apartment

231.12 --> 236.56
are you talking about nathan gaming

234.159 --> 236.56
is he

236.64 --> 239.64
what

244.959 --> 248.08
i don't know clearly

248.959 --> 252.959
i think he's probably just like setting

251.28 --> 255.84
up and

252.959 --> 258.639
editing stuff still and

255.84 --> 262.24
nathan's very busy

258.639 --> 265.12
he seems to be doing the gaming

262.24 --> 265.12
like during

265.199 --> 269.36
the after show

267.52 --> 271.59999999999997
believe certain points he leaves like

269.36 --> 273.6
the conversation to the panel

271.6 --> 275.68
and then he just does that

273.6 --> 279.04
and

275.68 --> 283.16
yeah i don't know

279.04 --> 283.16
[Music]

284.24 --> 287.759
he has gaming on this street yeah

289.68 --> 296.84000000000003
he's he's doing it during like the after

292.639 --> 296.84000000000003
show recording sometimes

297.52 --> 300.52
so

310.96 --> 314.0
wow by the way

323.44 --> 331.12
yeah wolfy

325.84 --> 334.71999999999997
sent this message like a giant message

331.12 --> 337.84000000000003
like an indirect email through gofundme

334.72 --> 340.88000000000005
to nathan and that thing is so insane

337.84 --> 340.88
and envious it's

341.12 --> 344.56
like it's mind-boggling

347.36 --> 352.56
so we'll be seeing about that on the fed

350.32 --> 354.88
i can assure you that

352.56 --> 357.84
god

354.88 --> 358.96
i cannot imagine being him and and then

357.84 --> 363.71999999999997
sending

358.96 --> 363.71999999999997
nathan that message it's so crazy

366.4 --> 372.23999999999995
i mean he's literally just expanding on

370.16 --> 375.199
bragging

372.24 --> 375.199
against nathan

376.24 --> 381.6
and he's just

377.919 --> 384.15999999999997
blatantly so incredibly jealous it is

381.6 --> 384.16
insane

388.96 --> 393.28
right

390.24 --> 395.12
i mean i've had like messages in that

393.28 --> 397.44
sort of directions but it's always been

395.12 --> 399.199
like from anonymous sock trolls or just

397.44 --> 401.36
like these

399.199 --> 403.36
bot light figures

401.36 --> 406.319
that keep messaging

403.36 --> 408.8
that keep sending the comments

406.319 --> 411.199
over and over again just trying to shame

408.8 --> 412.72
me well he sent that just in an overt

411.199 --> 416.319
identified

412.72 --> 416.319
message it's insane

416.56 --> 421.96
so wolfy is scared to come talk yeah no

418.96 --> 421.96
[ __ ]

449.919 --> 455.75899999999996
what are you talking about territory or

452.08 --> 455.75899999999996
six hello by the way pj cena

457.36 --> 460.56
jump

458.319 --> 463.8
what

460.56 --> 463.8
hey clutch

464.24 --> 467.24
um

473.49 --> 480.089
[Music]

501.52 --> 506.479
all right there's the first part of this

504.0 --> 508.479
show is going to have a little hiccup

506.479 --> 512.0
because i'm not feeling too great but

508.479 --> 514.479
i'm sure it's gonna recover and then

512.0 --> 517.12
gonna have a great

514.479 --> 520.12
other parts of the show

517.12 --> 520.12
so

522.479 --> 525.8000000000001
hold on

575.839 --> 577.9200000000001
you

596.72 --> 598.9590000000001
yep

601.279 --> 604.92
ax 320

605.53 --> 608.7099999999999
[Music]

614.01 --> 617.049
[Music]

619.63 --> 622.799
[Music]

638.16 --> 642.079
right so how are you guys doing

642.399 --> 647.839
is it as hot over there as it is here

645.36 --> 647.839
or worse

650.16 --> 654.519
kind of thing noteworthy happening

665.6 --> 675.839
[Music]

673.2 --> 675.839
huh

676.959 --> 680.88
why is it faster to make ice cubes out

678.959 --> 684.3199999999999
of hot water than cold water that's an

680.88 --> 684.32
interesting question is it

685.76 --> 689.12
i don't know

687.519 --> 691.92
but

689.12 --> 695.04
if it would be i can imagine only one

691.92 --> 698.8
reason and that is because of the weird

695.04 --> 700.64
expansion contraction effect of water

698.8 --> 703.4399999999999
you see

700.64 --> 704.88
cold water is like more dense more

703.44 --> 706.6400000000001
compact

704.88 --> 709.92
ice is

706.64 --> 712.88
actually less compact than water so if

709.92 --> 716.12
it's hot water that means that the water

712.88 --> 716.12
is expanded

717.04 --> 723.5999999999999
so if it can then be like flash frost

721.12 --> 726.639
cooled very quickly

723.6 --> 728.0790000000001
then it wouldn't have to like

726.639 --> 731.2
slowly

728.079 --> 733.3599999999999
expand in order to become the density of

731.2 --> 734.32
ice because it's warm so it could just

733.36 --> 736.24
like

734.32 --> 739.12
quickly transit

736.24 --> 741.6800000000001
quickly lose that heat without having to

739.12 --> 741.68
expand

741.839 --> 746.0
or yeah

743.2 --> 747.839
and that way it would crystallize faster

746.0 --> 748.8
that's the only way that i could think

747.839 --> 751.2790000000001
of

748.8 --> 756.04
like on the fly

751.279 --> 756.04
am i close x 320

757.1 --> 760.289
[Music]

764.48 --> 771.399
ah see

766.56 --> 771.399
it's what i do make sense of things

772.79 --> 775.9499999999999
[Music]

794.72 --> 799.8000000000001
but i've never even thought of that

796.16 --> 799.8
that's it's interesting

818.0 --> 822.959
hello matthew hall

820.639 --> 822.9590000000001
yeah

823.12 --> 828.079
hot water more free moving

825.76 --> 828.079
dude

830.56 --> 833.279
it's just that

833.519 --> 838.16
hot water growing cold it it would take

836.56 --> 839.68
some time

838.16 --> 842.0
right to

839.68 --> 846.16
like shrink down i think that the

842.0 --> 848.079
shrinking and expanding process of water

846.16 --> 850.56
in its liquid state

848.079 --> 854.399
probably takes longer

850.56 --> 854.399
than the actual transition

855.199 --> 859.5999999999999
right if that were the case it makes

857.839 --> 863.0
perfect sense that hot water would

859.6 --> 863.0
freeze faster

881.76 --> 884.76
right

891.04 --> 895.36
it also explains by the way why there's

893.279 --> 897.04
such a thing as

895.36 --> 900.9590000000001
moist

897.04 --> 903.5999999999999
air just touching upon like super cold

900.959 --> 906.88
rock and then immediately freezing so

903.6 --> 908.8000000000001
there isn't even a liquid state

906.88 --> 910.88
right

908.8 --> 913.92
because

910.88 --> 915.199
an ice crystal is closer to water vapor

913.92 --> 918.959
density

915.199 --> 918.959
than to cold water

920.56 --> 924.04
isn't that interesting

930.02 --> 934.1
[Music]

952.24 --> 955.24
right

959.47 --> 967.0
[Music]

964.639 --> 970.159
starting to feel better

967.0 --> 970.159
[Music]

999.68 --> 1002.0
wow

1003.279 --> 1009.199
by the way like it's

1005.44 --> 1011.1990000000001
just a little local news again it's

1009.199 --> 1013.3599999999999
being shoved in our face apparently that

1011.199 --> 1014.4799999999999
there's waves of migration coming

1013.36 --> 1016.9590000000001
because of

1014.48 --> 1020.399
global food crisis

1016.959 --> 1022.7199999999999
yes of course

1020.399 --> 1025.28
of course that's logical that that will

1022.72 --> 1027.839
happen you're shutting down our farmers

1025.28 --> 1029.28
our farms there's going to be hunger in

1027.839 --> 1031.039
other countries

1029.28 --> 1033.52
those countries yeah

1031.039 --> 1035.52
people are going to try to find better

1033.52 --> 1038.4
places and so they're going to migrate

1035.52 --> 1041.839
because of the hunger that you caused by

1038.4 --> 1044.4
shutting down our farmers feeding those

1041.839 --> 1048.8799999999999
migrants in other countries

1044.4 --> 1048.88
you freaking sick bastards

1049.12 --> 1052.12
ugh

1069.52 --> 1072.799
here's a reference to that

1076.64 --> 1080.5200000000002
as you can start water

1091.17 --> 1095.8400000000001
[Music]

1093.28 --> 1098.8799999999999
never heard of that pgcnet

1095.84 --> 1102.36
the site calls it a scientific fallacy

1098.88 --> 1102.3600000000001
what the [ __ ]

1110.96 --> 1113.8400000000001
it's an effect

1113.919 --> 1119.2
so it happens or it doesn't happen

1116.559 --> 1121.28
i don't see where the scientific fallacy

1119.2 --> 1123.8400000000001
comes in

1121.28 --> 1123.84
weird

1126.48 --> 1131.96
wait wait what are you talking about

1128.08 --> 1131.96
seeking star wars hello

1189.6 --> 1193.32
oh okay

1193.76 --> 1198.24
that's yeah that that also makes sense

1196.4 --> 1200.64
seeking star wars

1198.24 --> 1203.1200000000001
that it's simply a technological that a

1200.64 --> 1205.3600000000001
freezer will yeah we're gonna use a

1203.12 --> 1208.1589999999999
freezer for this test right

1205.36 --> 1210.9599999999998
so if you put something hot in there

1208.159 --> 1214.64
well this says that the freezer will

1210.96 --> 1217.2
make more effort cool off more to freeze

1214.64 --> 1218.72
it faster well you would be able to test

1217.2 --> 1221.28
that

1218.72 --> 1225.52
by basically putting cold water and hot

1221.28 --> 1225.52
water in exactly the same freezer

1226.08 --> 1232.32
because if that were true then the cold

1228.159 --> 1232.3200000000002
water would still freeze faster

1233.12 --> 1237.559
so i don't know

1267.919 --> 1270.919
hmm

1278.08 --> 1284.72
god never wins right

1281.6 --> 1284.7199999999998
okay fine

1285.919 --> 1291.8400000000001
it was a theoretical question from x 320

1289.28 --> 1291.84
anyway

1295.84 --> 1300.6399999999999
you know when people ask me like

1298.64 --> 1302.48
how would you explain this if it would

1300.64 --> 1305.2800000000002
happen well that doesn't mean that it

1302.48 --> 1307.76
does happen but if it would how would i

1305.28 --> 1310.48
try to explain it well i happen to be

1307.76 --> 1312.559
pretty good at that

1310.48 --> 1315.3600000000001
doesn't mean that the question is always

1312.559 --> 1319.559
going to be based on reality

1315.36 --> 1319.559
towards me so

1326.159 --> 1330.7600000000002
hey susie s good to see you

1332.48 --> 1336.0
it's gonna cool down here soon

1339.039 --> 1344.09
trouble breathing

1341.12 --> 1347.27
it's heat

1344.09 --> 1347.27
[Music]

1350.32 --> 1354.0
the trails of there are probably not

1352.24 --> 1356.96
helping either

1354.0 --> 1358.88
god i mean i've never seen them piling

1356.96 --> 1361.039
on this big before

1358.88 --> 1364.0800000000002
but just keep on going and going and

1361.039 --> 1364.08
going and going

1364.24 --> 1367.76
god

1365.36 --> 1371.6399999999999
can't you just

1367.76 --> 1371.64
enough is enough already

1374.08 --> 1377.6789999999999
that's weird yes yeah you can't pick it

1376.72 --> 1380.48
up

1377.679 --> 1384.48
those lines see that those are fresh so

1380.48 --> 1387.96
just keep on going and going

1384.48 --> 1387.96
enough already

1415.78 --> 1418.97
[Music]

1478.0 --> 1481.039
hey borders boy

1481.44 --> 1487.52
i don't i didn't say either borders boy

1484.48 --> 1489.919
i do say is that

1487.52 --> 1492.48
it's not condensation trails i don't

1489.919 --> 1494.72
know what it is but it is persistent and

1492.48 --> 1498.32
it is acting like

1494.72 --> 1498.32
persistent aerosol so

no borders boy

1805.84 --> 1811.1999999999998
not at all

1808.48 --> 1813.52
petrol and diesel cars are actually very

1811.2 --> 1813.52
clean

1813.679 --> 1818.799
compared to say

1815.279 --> 1820.0
40 years ago very clean

1818.799 --> 1823.279
yeah

1820.0 --> 1825.44
it's just like coal plants there's super

1823.279 --> 1827.679
clean coal plants

1825.44 --> 1830.24
well like that engines

1827.679 --> 1834.88
diesel and petrol engines have been

1830.24 --> 1834.88
developing and becoming extremely clean

1835.44 --> 1840.52
so

1837.52 --> 1840.52
now

1850.88 --> 1854.5200000000002
be right there guys

2000.24 --> 2003.44
it's definitely the air

2003.519 --> 2008.72
it's just

2004.72 --> 2008.72
it's thin here because it's warm

2009.679 --> 2012.88
ugh

2011.12 --> 2014.32
because like i was just sitting

2012.88 --> 2016.5590000000002
downstairs

2014.32 --> 2018.96
and it's a lot cooler there and like i'm

2016.559 --> 2022.32
just breathing better

2018.96 --> 2024.96
so that's that's what's making me

2022.32 --> 2028.0
feel ill here

2024.96 --> 2028.0
it's just too hot

2031.039 --> 2035.76
so sorry about uh yeah this first half

2033.679 --> 2039.1200000000001
being a bit uh

2035.76 --> 2039.12
just kind of nothing happening

2041.84 --> 2047.9189999999999
it is like 27 degrees though so

2046.0 --> 2049.76
it should get better like

2047.919 --> 2052.399
after two

2049.76 --> 2055.599
because then roughly then like the

2052.399 --> 2057.839
lights just not gonna hit

2055.599 --> 2059.3590000000004
the wall anymore

2057.839 --> 2060.56
then they should be able to breathe

2059.359 --> 2063.359
better

2060.56 --> 2063.359
very quickly

2063.599 --> 2068.079
so we're not feeling well it's

2065.44 --> 2070.32
nothing to worry about susie s thank you

2068.079 --> 2070.32
but

2073.119 --> 2076.8
let's just let

2074.399 --> 2079.359
i'm not getting enough oxygen i think

2076.8 --> 2081.28
effectively because the air is so thin

2079.359 --> 2083.5989999999997
because it's hot

2081.28 --> 2086.0
and because of the lack of oxygen like

2083.599 --> 2088.2400000000002
my intestines are like cramping or

2086.0 --> 2090.399
something because as soon as i just went

2088.24 --> 2092.7999999999997
down could breathe better it's like it

2090.399 --> 2095.46
immediately goes away

2092.8 --> 2098.559
so

2095.46 --> 2098.559
[Music]

2103.04 --> 2108.88

2163.839 --> 2167.88

2174.96 --> 2178.079
22 degrees

2181.28 --> 2184.76
so they say

2186.079 --> 2189.6800000000003
so that should be very doable

2199.28 --> 2204.48
i don't understand

2200.96 --> 2207.52
like what are they saying the wrong son

2204.48 --> 2209.28
like what does that mean

2207.52 --> 2211.839
you got a wrench now can you can you

2209.28 --> 2211.8390000000004
link up

2213.839 --> 2219.56

wrong song

2280.72 --> 2287.1189999999997
ladies seen it on twitter

2282.88 --> 2290.6400000000003
i still don't understand what that means

2287.119 --> 2293.04
clap ruckus what does it mean the wrong

2290.64 --> 2296.0789999999997
son like what the [ __ ] are you talking

2293.04 --> 2299.119
about how can you even relay a message

2296.079 --> 2301.3590000000004
like that it doesn't make any sense

2299.119 --> 2303.359
what do you think it means what did your

2301.359 --> 2306.0789999999997
mother think it means

2303.359 --> 2309.52
what are you talking about

2306.079 --> 2312.48
you're getting on my nerves man

2309.52 --> 2315.48

2364.16 --> 2366.48

2367.119 --> 2372.8
yeah borders but yeah of course

2369.76 --> 2375.3590000000004
yeah well green technology

2372.8 --> 2377.44
has a long way to go because a lot of

2375.359 --> 2378.96
well green technology is actually

2377.44 --> 2380.079
polluting

2378.96 --> 2384.4
but

2380.079 --> 2386.48
there's always been great potential for

2384.4 --> 2389.359
actual clean developments and yeah

2386.48 --> 2393.04
hydrogen tech is one of those i've had

2389.359 --> 2394.56
my eye on it well since i was a kid

2393.04 --> 2397.7599999999998
[Music]

2394.56 --> 2401.04
i've seen tractors out there riding

2397.76 --> 2404.3590000000004
like with hydrogen engines

2401.04 --> 2404.359
pretty badass

2412.079 --> 2415.079
okay

2471.68 --> 2477.96
keep my door open for a bit and let the

2474.16 --> 2477.96
wind breeze through

2502.319 --> 2506.64
right okay pj seen it yeah that's well

2504.64 --> 2508.8799999999997
that's really weird then

2506.64 --> 2510.56
thank you thank you for somebody

2508.88 --> 2513.28
actually trying to

2510.56 --> 2513.2799999999997
elaborate

2518.56 --> 2523.2
but it's like what still what does it

2521.599 --> 2527.52
mean it's like

2523.2 --> 2527.52
not the right type of sunlight for

2527.599 --> 2532.0
what for solar panels

2529.68 --> 2534.319
right i could imagine that like oh the

2532.0 --> 2536.88
solar panels like despite the sun being

2534.319 --> 2538.88
intense they just couldn't do anything

2536.88 --> 2540.56
with it because it was the wrong type of

2538.88 --> 2544.8
light

2540.56 --> 2547.7599999999998
right so then it sort of makes sense

2544.8 --> 2550.079
that's what they're talking about

2547.76 --> 2552.8
if it isn't then it makes absolutely no

2550.079 --> 2555.44
freaking sense

2552.8 --> 2557.52
to even say such a thing

2555.44 --> 2561.119
like what the hell does it even matter

2557.52 --> 2561.119
what type of sunlight it is

2561.2 --> 2565.839
to like the electric system that's just

2563.68 --> 2565.839

2577.04 --> 2582.88
psychotic break recently and

2579.92 --> 2585.44
hadn't noticed it

2582.88 --> 2589.599

2585.44 --> 2591.359
taking a lot of pharmaceuticals ah

2589.599 --> 2593.6800000000003
yes

2591.359 --> 2595.92
psychotic

2593.68 --> 2597.839
weird things you think and say and

2595.92 --> 2600.56
nobody pays attention and it doesn't

2597.839 --> 2603.56
make any sense and just slips through

2600.56 --> 2603.56
yes

2628.24 --> 2632.2799999999997
what the [ __ ]

2664.8 --> 2670.4
that's interesting borders boy yes

2667.52 --> 2673.8
for giant shipping freights it should be

2670.4 --> 2673.8
very interesting

2677.76 --> 2680.92
for freighters

2690.0 --> 2694.8
right but on the other hand uh yeah

2692.48 --> 2696.2400000000002
that's all really cool

2694.8 --> 2700.0
borders boy

2696.24 --> 2702.24
but yeah let's not get rid of oil though

2700.0 --> 2703.44
let's just not do that

2702.24 --> 2706.4799999999996
at all

2703.44 --> 2708.0
right there's a lot of

2706.48 --> 2710.88
very clean

2708.0 --> 2710.88
engines now

2715.04 --> 2719.4
don't need to get rid of it

2734.16 --> 2738.319
right because there's gonna be oil

2738.4 --> 2742.8
even if we don't use it there's still

2740.48 --> 2744.0
going to be oil right oil wells are

2742.8 --> 2746.5600000000004
gonna fill

2744.0 --> 2748.64
like eventually if nobody does anything

2746.56 --> 2752.24
it's just gonna start seeping out of the

2748.64 --> 2752.24
ground i'm not even joking

2755.28 --> 2760.6400000000003
it's gonna be there it used to be called

2757.44 --> 2764.319
tar pits

2760.64 --> 2764.319
yeah it's going to be there

2765.92 --> 2770.64
oh god clutch that's just terrible

2770.8 --> 2774.6800000000003
oh bundy bear

2810.8 --> 2813.119
right

2813.76 --> 2819.28
look i'm all for it to basically break

2816.56 --> 2820.64
the monopolies we break the old rubber

2819.28 --> 2823.3590000000004
barons

2820.64 --> 2824.64
problem is is that those old rubber

2823.359 --> 2826.96
barons

2824.64 --> 2829.04
are the ones that are doing this right

2826.96 --> 2831.44
they are owning the transition that's

2829.04 --> 2834.56
why all the freaking

2831.44 --> 2836.64
oil mega corporations around the world

2834.56 --> 2838.52
like all of them

2836.64 --> 2840.16
why they were the

2838.52 --> 2842.839
initiators

2840.16 --> 2847.68
of the climate change

2842.839 --> 2850.72
scam they were the ones that were paying

2847.68 --> 2853.52
money to create advertisement and

2850.72 --> 2856.0
popular culture references

2853.52 --> 2858.96
yeah that's what they did

2856.0 --> 2861.52
the oil rubber barons did that you

2858.96 --> 2861.52
understand

2866.96 --> 2872.0
just keep that in mind every time you

2869.44 --> 2874.2400000000002
you're like oh yes finally we're getting

2872.0 --> 2876.64
rid of oil yes

2874.24 --> 2877.359
and the oil rubber barons were the ones

2876.64 --> 2879.52
to

2877.359 --> 2881.2
initiate that plan

2879.52 --> 2883.839
it's not gonna

2881.2 --> 2887.7599999999998
have a twist to it really no they're

2883.839 --> 2890.7599999999998
just laying down all their power yes

2887.76 --> 2890.76
sure

2917.839 --> 2921.52
drone to drones

2934.48 --> 2941.2
i mean the postal service could do that

2939.04 --> 2943.2
but it is

2941.2 --> 2946.3999999999996
like very

2943.2 --> 2950.24
it's much more vulnerable

2946.4 --> 2950.2400000000002
right much more vulnerable

2954.72 --> 2959.52
i mean oh droning around and yeah how

2957.44 --> 2962.079
many what's the percentage of times when

2959.52 --> 2964.559
it goes wrong and literally falls out of

2962.079 --> 2965.3590000000004
the sky

2964.559 --> 2968.3190000000004
right

2965.359 --> 2971.2
and everything in the package is just

2968.319 --> 2973.599
shattered like what's the percentage

2971.2 --> 2973.5989999999997
going to be

2974.88 --> 2979.2000000000003
compared to

2976.4 --> 2982.2000000000003

3009.04 --> 3012.68
a what really

3013.599 --> 3020.0
you mean military drones for transport

3017.68 --> 3020.0
okay

3021.2 --> 3025.96
i guess

3022.4 --> 3025.96
they could do that

3034.079 --> 3041.1600000000003
hope they realize though that those

3036.16 --> 3041.16
military drones are actually hackable

3041.44 --> 3048.2000000000003
i'm quite certain that that problem's

3044.079 --> 3048.2000000000003
not gonna just go away

3060.16 --> 3065.359
you see that's always going to be the

3061.76 --> 3068.7200000000003
problem when you take out the

3065.359 --> 3071.839
take out the man out of the process

3068.72 --> 3073.9199999999996
said oh it's electronic oh you can

3071.839 --> 3077.04
remote control it oh that means that

3073.92 --> 3078.64
somebody could remote hack it then too

3077.04 --> 3080.24
they could find a way

3078.64 --> 3082.96
what are you gonna do then

3080.24 --> 3085.1189999999997
well nothing

3082.96 --> 3087.28
you you probably won't even know like

3085.119 --> 3089.44
where it is anymore

3087.28 --> 3089.44
so

3092.319 --> 3098.88
it's the same goes for like remote

3095.68 --> 3101.1189999999997
for like automated trucks

3098.88 --> 3105.92
it's all really cool and all oh it's so

3101.119 --> 3105.92
efficient you save so much labor yes

3106.48 --> 3111.28
but all that easy control could also be

3109.52 --> 3115.38
hijacked

very easily then

3142.16 --> 3145.7999999999997
choice by the way

is that well this freaking transition is

3181.68 --> 3185.2
already getting sponsored and all that

3183.76 --> 3188.0
by

3185.2 --> 3190.16
the oil rubber barons

3188.0 --> 3192.8
so

3190.16 --> 3192.7999999999997
the thing is

3192.96 --> 3198.079
anybody on the market out there they

3195.28 --> 3199.3590000000004
will always try to keep pushing the new

3198.079 --> 3201.6800000000003
thing

3199.359 --> 3204.16
in technological development

3201.68 --> 3206.24
so that everybody has to then focus on

3204.16 --> 3207.7599999999998
that to catch on and stay up to date

3206.24 --> 3210.8799999999997
right

3207.76 --> 3213.28
they will want to abandon things like

3210.88 --> 3215.28
fuel and diesel why

3213.28 --> 3217.76
why would they do that when it has been

3215.28 --> 3220.079
so thoroughly developed and researched

3217.76 --> 3221.119
and everybody specialized on it

3220.079 --> 3222.6400000000003
yes

3221.119 --> 3225.359
that's why

3222.64 --> 3228.0
that's why they want you to abandon it

3225.359 --> 3229.839
for the newer thing it's so much better

3228.0 --> 3233.28
the newer thing you have to go through

3229.839 --> 3236.24
the development and all the the garbage

3233.28 --> 3237.52
errors and [ __ ] things going wrong all

3236.24 --> 3239.4399999999996
over again

3237.52 --> 3241.28
and everybody's gonna have to abandon

3239.44 --> 3244.16
their skills that they developed using

3241.28 --> 3245.92
the old technology in order to figure

3244.16 --> 3248.8799999999997
out the new one

3245.92 --> 3252.96
all over again right why

3248.88 --> 3256.1600000000003
because the rubber barons have like

3252.96 --> 3259.04
upgraded the technology too much for

3256.16 --> 3261.5989999999997
them to keep their monopoly because it

3259.04 --> 3266.64
has been it is becoming naturally

3261.599 --> 3267.839
independent and easy that's why

3266.64 --> 3268.8799999999997
right

3267.839 --> 3270.64
because

3268.88 --> 3271.6800000000003
basically

3270.64 --> 3273.2
the

3271.68 --> 3276.5989999999997
fuel

3273.2 --> 3279.04
industry might become independent and

3276.599 --> 3281.28
decentralized to a certain degree it

3279.04 --> 3281.2799999999997
could

3282.319 --> 3286.64
so the robber barons want to step away

3284.319 --> 3288.799
because they don't like it

3286.64 --> 3291.04
when like

3288.799 --> 3294.24
the thing that they're trying to use and

3291.04 --> 3297.52
profit over it is becoming too free

3294.24 --> 3297.52
becoming too easy

3298.72 --> 3303.9199999999996
because then they lose

3301.28 --> 3307.44
the ability to switch up in the market

3303.92 --> 3309.359
prices right it's too easy it becomes

3307.44 --> 3311.76
independent if it becomes independent

3309.359 --> 3314.0
it's not going to be swayed by market

3311.76 --> 3315.5200000000004
swings anymore

3314.0 --> 3319.359
so

3315.52 --> 3321.839
they've probably foresaw this all coming

3319.359 --> 3324.0
and that's why all the oil rubber barons

3321.839 --> 3324.96
forwarded climate change that take down

3324.0 --> 3327.359
oil

3324.96 --> 3329.92
and work on these alternatives and then

3327.359 --> 3333.04
become the forerunner of these

3329.92 --> 3334.88
alternatives it's because oil

3333.04 --> 3338.88
engines

3334.88 --> 3340.7200000000003
fuel diesel it's becoming too efficient

3338.88 --> 3343.52
too easy

3340.72 --> 3345.52
to widely mastered

3343.52 --> 3347.28
so that it will become naturally

3345.52 --> 3349.52
independent

3347.28 --> 3351.76
and the industry

3349.52 --> 3354.72
doesn't want that

3351.76 --> 3357.6800000000003
so they are forcing everybody into the

3354.72 --> 3359.7599999999998
newer thing that still requires to go

3357.68 --> 3361.68
through all the developments

3359.76 --> 3364.1600000000003
and the issues and everybody has to

3361.68 --> 3366.16
learn all the new skills again

3364.16 --> 3369.319
that's what they want

3366.16 --> 3369.319
you see

3385.92 --> 3390.96
i mean do you realize even that like

3388.079 --> 3393.8390000000004
going to electric engines is basically

3390.96 --> 3395.44
going to end up discarding combustion

3393.839 --> 3396.96
engines

3395.44 --> 3399.92
because those types of engines are

3396.96 --> 3399.92
completely different

3401.28 --> 3406.3190000000004
right well combustion engines has is

3404.079 --> 3406.319
like

3406.72 --> 3411.68
developed to a level that is

3408.799 --> 3413.44
like unbelievable

3411.68 --> 3414.8799999999997
with unbelievable precision and

3413.44 --> 3418.7200000000003
efficiency

3414.88 --> 3420.799
right well a good side step but they

3418.72 --> 3423.5989999999997
won't allow it and they haven't really

3420.799 --> 3424.96
allowed it would be hydrogen guess what

3423.599 --> 3426.079
guess why

3424.96 --> 3427.599
because

3426.079 --> 3432.079
hydrogen

3427.599 --> 3433.599
is usable in combustion engines

3432.079 --> 3436.319
most of them

3433.599 --> 3439.3590000000004
it's i've heard all right new people

3436.319 --> 3441.2799999999997
that did that that converted like cars

3439.359 --> 3445.2799999999997
to hydrogen

3441.28 --> 3448.4
it wasn't even all that difficult to do

3445.28 --> 3450.4
you could just take a car and then

3448.4 --> 3453.119
like

3450.4 --> 3456.88
yeah like retool the innards

3453.119 --> 3456.88
and then you could run it on hydrogen

3457.2 --> 3463.04
just with the same engine and everything

3460.4 --> 3465.839
right so that's a good way to keep the

3463.04 --> 3469.119
combustion engine alive

3465.839 --> 3469.119
because it is like a

3471.119 --> 3475.04
a very

3473.119 --> 3477.6800000000003
developed thing

3475.04 --> 3480.319
that is going to be useful forever to

3477.68 --> 3482.24
have that within the pool of lore of

3480.319 --> 3486.4
mankind

3482.24 --> 3488.16
right outside of mega industry

3486.4 --> 3490.1600000000003
i mean mega industry is always going to

3488.16 --> 3492.3999999999996
end up like building the engines like

3490.16 --> 3495.52
the best ones

3492.4 --> 3499.44
but like you we don't necessarily even

3495.52 --> 3502.64
have to have all the best ones

3499.44 --> 3505.119
like it's becoming easier to like now

3502.64 --> 3507.1189999999997
industrially develop

3505.119 --> 3510.079
cast your own engines

3507.119 --> 3512.1600000000003
to a level that was like

3510.079 --> 3513.3590000000004
getting good in the 90s or something

3512.16 --> 3515.04
right

3513.359 --> 3517.5989999999997
because it's becoming easier to do that

3515.04 --> 3520.079
you get printing

3517.599 --> 3522.799
casting it's all becoming easier and now

3520.079 --> 3525.28
instead of having an entire factory with

3522.799 --> 3526.72
like 500 people just to get those

3525.28 --> 3531.599
engines built

3526.72 --> 3533.839
now you could like do it with five guys

3531.599 --> 3536.6400000000003
in your machine shop

3533.839 --> 3538.96
right decentralization

3536.64 --> 3542.0
combustion engines

3538.96 --> 3545.2
very important development don't

3542.0 --> 3547.119
make the mega corporations take away

3545.2 --> 3550.5589999999997
that heritage

3547.119 --> 3552.559
it is independence engines combustion

3550.559 --> 3555.44
engines are

3552.559 --> 3555.44
independents

3557.44 --> 3562.48
if you want to get the feel of this then

3559.28 --> 3564.4
what watch mad max

3562.48 --> 3566.48
the old ones mad max

3564.4 --> 3569.2000000000003
one and two

3566.48 --> 3570.319
watch it you get it

3569.2 --> 3572.319
engines

3570.319 --> 3574.079
is everything like even when everything

3572.319 --> 3576.5589999999997
goes to [ __ ]

3574.079 --> 3578.799
people that know engines

3576.559 --> 3582.0400000000004
are like

3578.799 --> 3582.04
the survivors

3588.48 --> 3592.72
i know pjc net yeah they just want to

3590.4 --> 3594.96
turn everything into electronics so they

3592.72 --> 3597.52
could just

3594.96 --> 3599.92
they're building the matrix around you

3597.52 --> 3602.0
instead of like building a matrix and a

3599.92 --> 3604.0
bunch of pods and then forcing you in a

3602.0 --> 3606.96
pod they're literally building the

3604.0 --> 3608.48
entire thing around you

3606.96 --> 3611.2
closing you in

3608.48 --> 3614.559
until you end up in a pot and you didn't

3611.2 --> 3617.5989999999997
even realize that over the ages that's

3614.559 --> 3617.599
where you ended up

3618.24 --> 3623.839
right they don't just oh here's the pots

3620.559 --> 3626.799
now get in your life is over no no no no

3623.839 --> 3628.72
your life slowly shrinks around you

3626.799 --> 3630.4
becomes smaller and smaller and you it's

3628.72 --> 3632.5589999999997
normalized everybody does that and

3630.4 --> 3634.7200000000003
normal smaller smaller and oh look

3632.559 --> 3636.4
virtual reality oh yeah yeah oh oh we

3634.72 --> 3639.04
could just have a very small compartment

3636.4 --> 3639.04
now oh look

3639.2 --> 3645.04
and now you're in a pot

3641.2 --> 3645.04
and you don't even realize it anymore

3645.839 --> 3650.72
now you are in the matrix

3647.839 --> 3653.2799999999997
that's what they want

3650.72 --> 3656.3999999999996
and combustion engines is

3653.28 --> 3658.4
a thing that they don't want

3656.4 --> 3660.559
they do they want that out of the pool

3658.4 --> 3663.119
of lore

3660.559 --> 3664.88
they want you to forget about it

3663.119 --> 3668.599
because it's gonna get in the way of

3664.88 --> 3668.599
that plan

3679.839 --> 3685.359
right so every time somebody's bringing

3682.079 --> 3687.8390000000004
up oh look at the clean technology real

3685.359 --> 3689.68
green i'm like yeah yeah combustion

3687.839 --> 3692.0789999999997
engines

3689.68 --> 3694.3999999999996
never abandon

3692.079 --> 3694.4
never

3695.28 --> 3700.3190000000004
keep the lore alive

3697.599 --> 3703.839
combustion engines yes green i'm all pro

3700.319 --> 3705.2799999999997
green don't let go of combustion engines

3703.839 --> 3708.0789999999997
never

3705.28 --> 3708.079
never let go

3708.16 --> 3712.72
never abandon

3709.839 --> 3715.119
it's never going to be outdated you see

3712.72 --> 3715.1189999999997
never

3715.52 --> 3721.28
it's going to be as outdated

3719.28 --> 3723.8390000000004
as

3721.28 --> 3726.1600000000003
as your your gun

3723.839 --> 3728.64
if you're an american right as your

3726.16 --> 3730.5589999999997
rifle it's going to get just as out yeah

3728.64 --> 3733.359
yeah we know we got jet engines and

3730.559 --> 3736.0
rocket launchers oh yeah but that gun is

3733.359 --> 3738.0789999999997
still not outdated though

3736.0 --> 3741.079
and neither will the combustion engine

3738.079 --> 3741.079
be

3749.76 --> 3752.6400000000003
right

3751.44 --> 3755.119
let

3752.64 --> 3757.52
i could get something sensible out of me

3755.119 --> 3757.52
today

3763.52 --> 3769.68
hey ben white stalled century

3767.2 --> 3770.72
yeah well they're certain they're sure

3769.68 --> 3773.359
trying

3770.72 --> 3776.16
to do that

3773.359 --> 3776.16
hey elise g

3779.68 --> 3782.96
right but

3780.72 --> 3786.16
whatever you do keep the combustion

3782.96 --> 3788.799
engine technology alive it's so useful

3786.16 --> 3790.5589999999997
it's and not just for transportation

3788.799 --> 3792.48
guys

3790.559 --> 3794.8390000000004
for machinery

3792.48 --> 3797.28
especially outdoor

3794.839 --> 3799.68
right i mean

3797.28 --> 3802.559
if you're like a logger or something

3799.68 --> 3805.0389999999998
dude combustion engines man it's so

3802.559 --> 3808.079
freaking useful

3805.039 --> 3810.4
and it's not just gonna break i mean a

3808.079 --> 3812.2400000000002
chainsaw oh what you want an electric

3810.4 --> 3814.48
chainsaw no

3812.24 --> 3814.4799999999996
no

3815.76 --> 3818.4
[ __ ]

3818.559 --> 3823.76
right

3820.319 --> 3824.88
an electric sawmill

3823.76 --> 3826.6400000000003
maybe

3824.88 --> 3828.1600000000003
but even if it's going to be electric

3826.64 --> 3830.24
guess what's going to power that

3828.16 --> 3832.0
electricity in the middle of nowhere

3830.24 --> 3834.16
that's right a

3832.0 --> 3835.76
diesel engine generator

3834.16 --> 3837.2
right so

3835.76 --> 3838.7200000000003
don't let go

3837.2 --> 3840.16
don't let it go

3838.72 --> 3842.48
really don't

3840.16 --> 3844.0
never let go of combustion engines i

3842.48 --> 3846.2
mean it guys

3844.0 --> 3849.599
industry guys

3846.2 --> 3849.5989999999997
self-sufficiency guys

3850.079 --> 3854.48
don't let go the combustion engine

3854.72 --> 3857.52
never forget

3860.72 --> 3865.4399999999996
right and even if big oil doesn't yield

3863.68 --> 3869.68
anymore if they close it all down and

3865.44 --> 3871.839
there's no more fuel make your own fuel

3869.68 --> 3873.359
right diesel engines you could use

3871.839 --> 3877.52
biodiesel

3873.359 --> 3879.839
regular engines you could use hydrogen

3877.52 --> 3881.92
right there's so many directions you

3879.839 --> 3885.2
could go at

3881.92 --> 3885.2000000000003
don't let it go

3893.119 --> 3900.4
steam the same era as team yeah except

3897.599 --> 3902.4
it won't be borders boy i think you're a

3900.4 --> 3904.2400000000002
really creepy guy

3902.4 --> 3906.1600000000003
you're creepy to say that after

3904.24 --> 3908.319
everything i've said i think you're

3906.16 --> 3911.7599999999998
creepy borders boy i think you are a

3908.319 --> 3914.0
creepy ass guy the way that you talk and

3911.76 --> 3914.0
think

3921.359 --> 3924.64
after everything i've said

3925.44 --> 3929.52
now the point is the combustion engine

3927.839 --> 3930.96
is not

3929.52 --> 3934.079
going to be

3930.96 --> 3934.079
like the steam engine

3935.039 --> 3942.96
yeah it has surpassed the steam engine

3940.16 --> 3946.48
like a thousand fold

3942.96 --> 3949.2
a thousand fold guys

3946.48 --> 3950.48
steam engine was like the the [ __ ]

3949.2 --> 3952.48
little brother

3950.48 --> 3954.48
of the combustion engine literally the

3952.48 --> 3956.079
[ __ ] little brother

3954.48 --> 3960.16
very rusty

3956.079 --> 3962.88
very rough very unstable

3960.16 --> 3965.7599999999998
and then they like oh let's just

3962.88 --> 3966.88
do it with combustion instead of steam

3965.76 --> 3970.559
and then

3966.88 --> 3971.52
things hit off then it got real

3970.559 --> 3973.6800000000003
yeah

3971.52 --> 3976.4
there is nothing

3973.68 --> 3979.0389999999998
alternative that is going to make the

3976.4 --> 3982.319
combustion engine at this point look

3979.039 --> 3982.3190000000004
like the steam engine

3982.48 --> 3987.76
sounds like robber baron propaganda to

3985.52 --> 3987.7599999999998
me

3988.319 --> 3994.0
yeah the change is coming yes yes robber

3991.2 --> 3997.2799999999997
baron chill do you get paid for this

3994.0 --> 3998.48
borders boy you get paid to do this huh

3997.28 --> 4000.88
yeah

3998.48 --> 4002.319
opinion placement huh are you are you

4000.88 --> 4004.1600000000003
into that you're getting paid for that

4002.319 --> 4006.64
borders boy

4004.16 --> 4009.0389999999998
i'm on to you man you think you could

4006.64 --> 4011.2799999999997
just do that and not have me pick up on

4009.039 --> 4013.599
that

4011.28 --> 4013.599
huh

4017.92 --> 4022.92
you shilling for a robber barons are you

4059.76 --> 4063.2000000000003
steam engines are still used at power

4062.0 --> 4065.44
play

4063.2 --> 4067.7599999999998
fair enough elishee but that's like

4065.44 --> 4071.68
nuclear power plants

4067.76 --> 4073.8390000000004
but you're completely right that's

4071.68 --> 4076.5589999999997
thank you for that

4073.839 --> 4079.359
you actually

4076.559 --> 4081.119
made a point that was like to my level

4079.359 --> 4083.68
that i was making

4081.119 --> 4086.079
but back to me that like yeah you're

4083.68 --> 4088.319
right even steam engines are still now

4086.079 --> 4088.319
being

4088.839 --> 4092.16
used uh

4092.96 --> 4096.56
right

4093.839 --> 4097.92
and that's steam engine

4096.56 --> 4100.400000000001
so

4097.92 --> 4101.92
if they're still being used what you

4100.4 --> 4104.0
think that

4101.92 --> 4106.799
combustion engine is gonna become

4104.0 --> 4106.799
outdated

4107.04 --> 4112.04
no

4108.08 --> 4112.04
no no no no

4121.689 --> 4124.909000000001
[Music]

4129.55 --> 4152.689
[Music]

4168.96 --> 4172.04
all right

4187.6 --> 4190.88
that's right pgcnet it's really that

4189.839 --> 4192.4
simple

4190.88 --> 4195.0
right

4192.4 --> 4199.199
it comes down to this be the

4195.0 --> 4200.159
anti-government don't be an anarchist

4199.199 --> 4203.28
just

4200.159 --> 4205.92
whatever they want whatever comes out of

4203.28 --> 4208.8
this monster media

4205.92 --> 4212.2390000000005
and out of mega industrialists

4208.8 --> 4214.56
and their sick little mind control plans

4212.239 --> 4218.879999999999
whatever they want

4214.56 --> 4220.8
want the exact diametric opposite and do

4218.88 --> 4222.96
not relent

4220.8 --> 4226.0
do not relent

4222.96 --> 4230.64
not a little bit snuff everything they

4226.0 --> 4233.52
want immediately immediately

4230.64 --> 4235.76
nothing immediately

4233.52 --> 4238.76
exactly the opposite of what they want

4235.76 --> 4238.76
immediately

4239.52 --> 4244.84
it's the only way to survive this

4245.84 --> 4252.64
because satan controls

4249.679 --> 4252.64
big industry

4252.719 --> 4255.679
and politics

4256.48 --> 4260.5599999999995
and

4257.52 --> 4262.719
the only way to outlive it is to let it

4260.56 --> 4265.4400000000005
die

4262.719 --> 4267.36
by completely taking away all their

4265.44 --> 4270.639999999999
power

4267.36 --> 4272.799999999999
by ignoring them to death

4270.64 --> 4274.96
and doing the exact opposite of

4272.8 --> 4276.96
everything they want

4274.96 --> 4278.159
but that's going to take some very

4276.96 --> 4281.12
savage

4278.159 --> 4281.12
level discipline

4282.48 --> 4286.5599999999995
so are you going to have that in you or

4284.56 --> 4288.159000000001
you're going to just end up struggling

4286.56 --> 4290.2390000000005
fighting

4288.159 --> 4292.32
another generation that just went with

4290.239 --> 4295.04
the corruption again

4292.32 --> 4295.04
what are you gonna do

4296.32 --> 4301.28
because that's gonna happen right why do

4298.4 --> 4304.719
you think i i keep foaming at the mouth

4301.28 --> 4306.88
trying to tell you you have to kill them

4304.719 --> 4309.679
you have to kill these sick

4306.88 --> 4312.400000000001
[ __ ] politicians that you can't

4309.679 --> 4316.159
even call politicians anymore just these

4312.4 --> 4317.92
anti-human genocidal freaks

4316.159 --> 4320.239
gotta kill them

4317.92 --> 4323.4400000000005
because if you oh just oh we could just

4320.239 --> 4326.48
be peacefully demonstrating oh yes how

4323.44 --> 4328.48
is that working out so far huh huh

4326.48 --> 4330.5599999999995
oh you you forgot

4328.48 --> 4333.678999999999
you don't have a memory of like the past

4330.56 --> 4336.400000000001
20 years huh huh how's that [ __ ]

4333.679 --> 4339.28
working out for you huh

4336.4 --> 4342.0
are you feeling the peace yet

4339.28 --> 4346.08
with your peaceful demonstration

4342.0 --> 4347.6
is it working out yet huh

4346.08 --> 4349.92
no

4347.6 --> 4349.92
hmm

4353.28 --> 4358.639999999999
yeah

4355.199 --> 4360.32
because it's only going to end one way

4358.64 --> 4362.320000000001
and that is

4360.32 --> 4363.28
the conspirators

4362.32 --> 4366.159
are

4363.28 --> 4366.159
executed

4368.96 --> 4375.28
i suggest a universal death penalty for

4372.8 --> 4378.56
all politicians that are part of the

4375.28 --> 4381.159
world economic forum bilderberg group

4378.56 --> 4382.96
and that are probably

4381.159 --> 4386.48
contributing

4382.96 --> 4390.08
to genocidal eugenics

4386.48 --> 4390.08
extermination policies

4393.04 --> 4396.159
worldwide

4394.4 --> 4399.599999999999
worldwide

4396.159 --> 4401.599999999999
arrest them put them on holds wait for

4399.6 --> 4402.719
the rest to arrest them

4401.6 --> 4403.679
then

4402.719 --> 4406.2390000000005
big

4403.679 --> 4407.04
big trial

4406.239 --> 4408.32
yeah

4407.04 --> 4410.0
nurenberg

4408.32 --> 4412.239
two

4410.0 --> 4414.719
no it's gonna be like much more

4412.239 --> 4416.32
elaborate than that nurnberg is just

4414.719 --> 4419.12
like

4416.32 --> 4424.639999999999
this is past nuremberg level

4419.12 --> 4428.159
by like a margin of like 500 already

4424.64 --> 4430.56
so it's going to be way bigger

4428.159 --> 4433.44
and it's going to be a big trial

4430.56 --> 4435.360000000001
and there's going to be a lot of people

4433.44 --> 4437.5199999999995
getting the death penalty in those

4435.36 --> 4439.44
trials

4437.52 --> 4442.320000000001
and those death penalties are not going

4439.44 --> 4442.32
to be soft

4448.4 --> 4452.199
that's what's got to happen

4454.48 --> 4458.0
and it might be coming it's it's all a

4456.48 --> 4460.4
matter of oh

4458.0 --> 4462.08
how much do you still want to convince

4460.4 --> 4464.719
yourself that

4462.08 --> 4466.96
just doing it all peaceful and oh it

4464.719 --> 4469.92
will all resolve itself

4466.96 --> 4472.56
just remain peaceful at all costs

4469.92 --> 4475.6
how long are you gonna hold on to that

4472.56 --> 4477.76
as literally entire world turns to hell

4475.6 --> 4482.400000000001
around you how long are you gonna hold

4477.76 --> 4485.12
on to that yeah onto that pipe dream

4482.4 --> 4487.44
i mean that entire space for your mind

4485.12 --> 4489.679
to dream about that is gonna grow

4487.44 --> 4493.5199999999995
tighter and tighter and tighter how long

4489.679 --> 4493.52
are you gonna hold on to that huh

4494.08 --> 4499.44
are we gonna actually

4495.84 --> 4502.56
just get the [ __ ] over it

4499.44 --> 4505.599999999999
and finish this

4502.56 --> 4505.6
finish them

4506.0 --> 4508.96
fatality

4509.6 --> 4513.1990000000005
get it over with

4511.52 --> 4517.280000000001
end it

4513.199 --> 4520.159
i mean if we end it

4517.28 --> 4523.679
it's gonna be done

4520.159 --> 4526.719
and there's gonna be a new era

4523.679 --> 4529.36
and it will be different

4526.719 --> 4532.0
and they're gonna try it again though

4529.36 --> 4534.4
but never like this again never with

4532.0 --> 4536.88
this kind of organized

4534.4 --> 4540.799999999999
setup

4536.88 --> 4542.400000000001
all we have to do is finish it

4540.8 --> 4544.56
finish him off

4542.4 --> 4547.679
there will always be new

4544.56 --> 4549.84
weirdo politician and cultists trying

4547.679 --> 4553.84
something but they will never have this

4549.84 --> 4553.84
grip again and they shouldn't

4555.04 --> 4561.44
let's finish it

4557.36 --> 4563.679
stop pretending like you like you can

4561.44 --> 4564.639999999999
out piece them

4563.679 --> 4568.56
like

4564.64 --> 4571.1990000000005
being peaceful is a weapon in a war

4568.56 --> 4575.04
stop having these delusional gandhi

4571.199 --> 4577.919999999999
fantasies it's delusion gandhi was a

4575.04 --> 4580.4
controlled opposition agent

4577.92 --> 4584.4800000000005
he was an agent and a traitor

4580.4 --> 4587.679
a freemason traitor this guy is

4584.48 --> 4590.48
like he's the einstein of peace okay i

4587.679 --> 4593.679
can't say it any better than that gandhi

4590.48 --> 4596.48
is the einstein of peace and if you know

4593.679 --> 4598.96
anything about einstein you know how

4596.48 --> 4601.28
[ __ ] that really is

4598.96 --> 4601.28
okay

4604.159 --> 4609.12
gandhi was a mockery

4607.199 --> 4611.599999999999
not real

4609.12 --> 4614.159
and he was a psychopath too he was a

4611.6 --> 4617.92
creepy ass guy

4614.159 --> 4620.0
not the guy you're told he is who's been

4617.92 --> 4621.6
telling you that he's all that great guy

4620.0 --> 4623.04
who is that huh

4621.6 --> 4625.76
it's like it's

4623.04 --> 4628.239
like a group of people that kind of lean

4625.76 --> 4630.08
to a certain direction

4628.239 --> 4631.28
what is that all the

4630.08 --> 4632.239
left

4631.28 --> 4635.199
yeah

4632.239 --> 4637.839999999999
that's right the left

4635.199 --> 4638.96
oh how they used to love gandhi didn't

4637.84 --> 4640.56
they

4638.96 --> 4642.56
they don't love them now anymore because

4640.56 --> 4644.4800000000005
they've just

4642.56 --> 4646.2390000000005
taken their cloak off and just like yeah

4644.48 --> 4648.48
we're demons now

4646.239 --> 4651.44
but they were the gandhi people oh yes

4648.48 --> 4654.718999999999
they were

4651.44 --> 4654.719
because it was their guy

4655.44 --> 4659.199
back then all the way over there

4663.44 --> 4665.839999999999
right

4666.4 --> 4672.639999999999
i'm just saying gandhi

4669.36 --> 4674.48
was the einstein of peace

4672.64 --> 4678.360000000001
of peaceful protest

4674.48 --> 4678.36
it was all [ __ ]

4685.12 --> 4688.12
right

4692.48 --> 4698.4
i mean like do you even have any example

4696.159 --> 4701.04
anywhere else in history

4698.4 --> 4706.12
where just peacefully resisting like

4701.04 --> 4706.12
broke it it broke them

4706.239 --> 4711.44
they won because they were peacefully

4708.48 --> 4714.08
resisting in hunger striking and and now

4711.44 --> 4715.919999999999
the government is is fallen

4714.08 --> 4718.92
how many times has that actually

4715.92 --> 4718.92
happened

4728.96 --> 4731.679
one

4730.239 --> 4734.678999999999
one time

4731.679 --> 4734.679
gandhi

4735.44 --> 4741.919999999999
because all the other times it it hasn't

4738.32 --> 4741.92
actually worked hasn't it

4743.44 --> 4751.199
so did it actually work or was it just a

4747.44 --> 4755.36
setup was it just a

4751.199 --> 4759.599999999999
a false inspiration that was planned in

4755.36 --> 4759.599999999999
peaceful protest oh yes

4760.0 --> 4765.6
non-violent engagement

4762.48 --> 4768.959999999999
it's the best way to resist

4765.6 --> 4768.96
no no it's not

4770.56 --> 4778.88
no actually just going at the throats of

4774.4 --> 4779.679
the disgusting demonic conspirators

4778.88 --> 4783.04
with

4779.679 --> 4785.679
contempt for humanity just going after

4783.04 --> 4788.8
them and taking care of it that's the

4785.679 --> 4789.6
actual way to solve things

4788.8 --> 4792.56
not

4789.6 --> 4796.719
sitting down and not eating anything

4792.56 --> 4796.719
until somebody gives you what you want

4797.6 --> 4800.6
huh

4815.36 --> 4819.5599999999995
yeah no [ __ ] bjc net

4820.0 --> 4825.84
a peaceful protest but you know who that

4822.96 --> 4827.84
worked for sort of

4825.84 --> 4830.0
liberals

4827.84 --> 4832.4800000000005
remember that remember

4830.0 --> 4835.12
when the liberals were the peaceful

4832.48 --> 4837.12
protesters and it worked

4835.12 --> 4840.159
you know why it worked

4837.12 --> 4842.96
because it was a like a really wide

4840.159 --> 4845.28
worldwide effort it was a worldwide

4842.96 --> 4847.44
thing it was a movement

4845.28 --> 4849.599999999999
a spirit

4847.44 --> 4851.44
and then it kind of works because

4849.6 --> 4855.120000000001
one does it and then everybody resonates

4851.44 --> 4856.159
like oh oh yes all of us here we're

4855.12 --> 4858.84
together

4856.159 --> 4862.159
right in a good spirit like we can

4858.84 --> 4865.4400000000005
conquer war and dictatorship

4862.159 --> 4868.159
it's like that's not a bad thought right

4865.44 --> 4870.0
it's not there anymore though

4868.159 --> 4872.08
it's gone

4870.0 --> 4874.4
they're not like that anymore they don't

4872.08 --> 4876.32
do that now

4874.4 --> 4880.48
why would you think

4876.32 --> 4880.48
it would still work then

4880.719 --> 4884.32
when you don't

4882.08 --> 4885.84
have the media

4884.32 --> 4889.5199999999995
at your back

4885.84 --> 4892.4800000000005
when you don't have a worldwide movement

4889.52 --> 4893.6
to support that idea and the spirit of

4892.48 --> 4896.159
it

4893.6 --> 4897.52
how are you gonna do it then

4896.159 --> 4898.48
you're not

4897.52 --> 4900.8
yes

4898.48 --> 4902.879999999999
you're getting it you're not you're not

4900.8 --> 4906.719
gonna do it without all that

4902.88 --> 4908.56
it can't work it only works for the

4906.719 --> 4909.44
liberals

4908.56 --> 4911.52
the

4909.44 --> 4913.28
liberals don't give a [ __ ] anymore

4911.52 --> 4916.56
because they took their cloak off and

4913.28 --> 4918.96
they're like yeah we're demons now [ __ ]

4916.56 --> 4921.280000000001
peaceful protest you're going to do what

4918.96 --> 4923.28
we say or we're going to drive you crazy

4921.28 --> 4924.8
and make you kill yourself

4923.28 --> 4926.719
huh

4924.8 --> 4929.360000000001
who needs peaceful protest where we

4926.719 --> 4931.199
could do that huh

4929.36 --> 4933.36
yeah that's what we're at now that's

4931.199 --> 4934.638999999999
where we're at

4933.36 --> 4937.199
so

4934.639 --> 4941.04
just forget about gandhi

4937.199 --> 4943.5199999999995
it only ever worked for the liberals

4941.04 --> 4946.08
they're not using it that doesn't mean

4943.52 --> 4949.76
that you can now use it

4946.08 --> 4949.76
it was never yours

4951.55 --> 4956.719
[Music]

4952.8 --> 4960.8
it doesn't work it only works with a

4956.719 --> 4960.8
massive organized effort

4961.36 --> 4966.639
where when you have media control

4964.239 --> 4969.599999999999
when you have organizations around the

4966.639 --> 4971.12
world and everybody is like fanatically

4969.6 --> 4973.84
on that

4971.12 --> 4975.28
like the liberals were the old left it

4973.84 --> 4977.360000000001
worked

4975.28 --> 4980.08
now it's become demonic and it doesn't

4977.36 --> 4981.36
work anymore

4980.08 --> 4982.639
right

4981.36 --> 4985.679
but

4982.639 --> 4988.400000000001
as outsiders you can't just step in and

4985.679 --> 4991.04
say like oh yeah we're gonna do that now

4988.4 --> 4993.44
yeah it doesn't work that way

4991.04 --> 4996.639
it only works that way when you have the

4993.44 --> 5000.04
same conditions present

4996.639 --> 5000.04
and we don't

5001.28 --> 5006.88
the liberals are now demonic and they're

5003.84 --> 5006.88
still in control

5007.92 --> 5013.1990000000005
it only worked then because the media

5010.8 --> 5015.679
was actually free

5013.199 --> 5017.678999999999
from the control

5015.679 --> 5019.52
they were liberal

5017.679 --> 5021.76
that worked because they were not in

5019.52 --> 5024.2390000000005
control

5021.76 --> 5026.96
now they are

5024.239 --> 5028.5599999999995
and so it doesn't work anymore

5026.96 --> 5031.12
because they don't give a [ __ ] for that

5028.56 --> 5033.4400000000005
anymore they just are cracking down like

5031.12 --> 5037.719
a demon on the throne

5033.44 --> 5037.719
and they're just reaping souls

5050.239 --> 5052.799999999999
that's right

5053.36 --> 5060.239
so again another case

5057.28 --> 5063.28
for why peaceful protest

5060.239 --> 5063.28
is pointless

5064.88 --> 5070.56
you gotta go at the monsters

5068.88 --> 5072.56
you gotta lay down

5070.56 --> 5075.280000000001
your longing

5072.56 --> 5075.280000000001
for peace

5075.44 --> 5081.36
you gotta lay that down because peace is

5078.56 --> 5081.360000000001
not worth

5082.0 --> 5086.159
like getting crushed on the reboot

5083.92 --> 5087.28
slowly for the rest of your life it just

5086.159 --> 5090.92
isn't

5087.28 --> 5090.92
it's just not

5115.04 --> 5120.92
reminds me of owens rock paper scissors

5117.6 --> 5120.92
jug wet

5140.88 --> 5146.8
sure it can be saved

5143.44 --> 5146.799999999999
what you mean it

5150.4 --> 5155.679
no i think there's definitely

5153.679 --> 5157.92
still saving to be done there's a lot of

5155.679 --> 5159.36
people by building power being very

5157.92 --> 5161.4400000000005
strong

5159.36 --> 5163.04
it's just gonna take some time to

5161.44 --> 5166.719
realize that

5163.04 --> 5169.44
not all of the the real free powerful

5166.719 --> 5172.639
people that are free of this monster are

5169.44 --> 5172.638999999999
going to get out of it alive

5172.719 --> 5177.12
the the system is not going to allow

5175.28 --> 5179.199
that to happen

5177.12 --> 5182.48
so there's only one sensible course and

5179.199 --> 5184.96
that is that they become

5182.48 --> 5189.04
the yeah

5184.96 --> 5192.2390000000005
the acting hand to end it

5189.04 --> 5194.84
to end this monstrosity and potentially

5192.239 --> 5197.12
have their lives ruined

5194.84 --> 5198.639
forever because of the things that they

5197.12 --> 5202.0
would have to do

5198.639 --> 5203.36
in order to accomplish that

5202.0 --> 5205.679
they will be

5203.36 --> 5207.12
regarded as criminals or resistance

5205.679 --> 5208.84
fighters they're never going to know

5207.12 --> 5211.92
peace again after that

5208.84 --> 5214.4800000000005
probably it's why i'm not

5211.92 --> 5217.36
super eager to do it myself

5214.48 --> 5219.919999999999
because i know what will happen

5217.36 --> 5222.639
there's just no other way i have not

5219.92 --> 5225.52
seen another way

5222.639 --> 5228.719
it's a matter of time

5225.52 --> 5231.84
either some choose to go and do it and

5228.719 --> 5234.719
sacrifice their peace

5231.84 --> 5236.400000000001
or everybody dies

5234.719 --> 5239.44
nightmarishly

5236.4 --> 5241.199
and there will be nothing left

5239.44 --> 5244.4
no more roots

5241.199 --> 5247.4
no more roots to spray up form

5244.4 --> 5247.4
right

5255.44 --> 5258.799999999999
so yeah

5256.8 --> 5263.04
effectively civil war

5258.8 --> 5264.96
but just not like civil unrest

5263.04 --> 5267.12
[ __ ] right

5264.96 --> 5269.36
oh dissatisfaction oh

5267.12 --> 5272.239
we're gonna riot no no no no

5269.36 --> 5274.799999999999
no actual war like

5291.719 --> 5298.719
politicians huh huh yeah

5305.44 --> 5308.719

[Music]

5386.56 --> 5391.719
yeah i'm gonna rewrite the doc come on

5388.719 --> 5391.719

5402.11 --> 5405.28
[Music]

5407.199 --> 5410.4
tell me guys what you think

5411.04 --> 5416.56
never abandoned combustion engines

5413.679 --> 5419.1990000000005
gandhi was the einstein of peace

5416.56 --> 5421.360000000001
i guess that gandhi was the einstein of

5419.199 --> 5423.44
peace is like an epic enough title by

5421.36 --> 5426.159
itself but yeah since we were talking a

5423.44 --> 5428.96
lot about combustion engines

5426.159 --> 5430.879999999999
still want to put that in the title

5428.96 --> 5432.88
but i'm really proud of that

5430.88 --> 5436.08
gandhi was the einstein of peace i'm

5432.88 --> 5436.08
like yeah

5441.76 --> 5446.88
and i think i've actually first did this

5444.8 --> 5448.96
i've never heard anybody say that before

5446.88 --> 5452.28
even though it's so in your face it's

5448.96 --> 5452.28
right there

5469.04 --> 5472.96
really terrific

5470.8 --> 5474.719
you were watching gandhi before joining

5472.96 --> 5477.28
this stream what do you think you think

5474.719 --> 5481.04
i'm on to something here

5477.28 --> 5481.04
you think my analogy is correct

5482.159 --> 5486.08
i mean i am

5483.679 --> 5487.6
if you have doubts or you have details

5486.08 --> 5492.159

5727.6 --> 5730.159000000001
is like

5730.32 --> 5737.32
even more close to einstein in format

5733.04 --> 5737.32
than i'd even thought of

5764.0 --> 5767.0
yep

5779.04 --> 5783.159
interesting never heard of that

5826.31 --> 5829.389

5875.84 --> 5881.28
it's not shitty i mean it's like

5878.56 --> 5884.159000000001
30 years old it's incredible but there

5881.28 --> 5888.119
are some keys that are like

5884.159 --> 5888.119
they don't always want to work

5900.639 --> 5903.92
oh fresh air

5905.44 --> 5910.879999999999
it really is the air like

5907.84 --> 5912.96
just now i just had massive cramp attack

5910.88 --> 5915.4400000000005
again because like the door had been

5912.96 --> 5919.119
closed and the air was super still it's

5915.44 --> 5919.119
really the fresh air man

5920.9 --> 5925.759999999999
[Music]

5923.119 --> 5927.119
by the way the sky is completely fogged

look at this i'm gonna round out the

5928.719 --> 5933.28
show soon by the way

5931.04 --> 5935.679
look

5933.28 --> 5935.679
i mean

5950.159 --> 5956.159
i guess they really wanted to do

5952.719 --> 5956.159
something about that heat today

5957.199 --> 5962.0
prefer super chats or paypal well paypal

5960.0 --> 5964.159
definitely cycle

5962.0 --> 5966.8
paypal i always prefer that because then

5964.159 --> 5969.5199999999995
i actually get all of it and i get it

5966.8 --> 5969.52
pretty quickly

5970.32 --> 5973.92
super chats you could still do that just

5972.56 --> 5976.320000000001
for like

5973.92 --> 5978.639
message boarding right for the fun of it

5976.32 --> 5980.719
but just don't throw giant piles at me

5978.639 --> 5984.32
because i'm actually not gonna get that

5980.719 --> 5987.28
really not even joking

5984.32 --> 5989.44
but if you paypal me then i will

5987.28 --> 5992.719
and that would that's the most helpful i

5989.44 --> 5995.5199999999995
could sure use it by the way

5992.719 --> 5998.8
global warming over there

5995.52 --> 6000.400000000001
well it looks more like geoengineering

5998.8 --> 6002.2390000000005
than what

6000.4 --> 6003.839999999999
it just chemtrailed the [ __ ] out of the

6002.239 --> 6006.32
place

6003.84 --> 6008.159000000001
or trailed i i don't even want to call

6006.32 --> 6010.5599999999995
it chemtrail because i don't know it is

6008.159 --> 6014.719
chemicals i just know it's aerosol it's

6010.56 --> 6015.76
solid particles not water vapor

6014.719 --> 6019.679
but

6015.76 --> 6022.0
if it was actually like aluminum and

6019.679 --> 6024.4
barium oxide and all that thing that's

6022.0 --> 6026.639
like popularly said to be what

6024.4 --> 6028.32
chemtrails is

6026.639 --> 6031.04
i don't think it could be because that

6028.32 --> 6032.239
would just like wreck nature really

6031.04 --> 6034.48
badly

6032.239 --> 6037.48
because it's been going on since

6034.48 --> 6037.48
1995.

6037.52 --> 6041.6
it nature could not have sustained that

6040.719 --> 6043.6
much

6041.6 --> 6046.719
poisoning for that long

6043.6 --> 6047.84
it's just not possible so it it can't be

6046.719 --> 6049.6
that

6047.84 --> 6054.08
it's not logical

6049.6 --> 6058.639
maybe it had been in certain regions

6054.08 --> 6058.639
i just don't know if that's here

6060.08 --> 6065.679
so i've been hoping secretly or not

6062.96 --> 6067.76
secretly overtly that they've actually

6065.679 --> 6069.76
been spraying silicon

6067.76 --> 6072.400000000001
just sand dust

6069.76 --> 6074.08
that they're just trying to artificially

6072.4 --> 6076.96
manipulate the weather in an

6074.08 --> 6078.4
environmentally friendly way

6076.96 --> 6083.04
and yeah

6078.4 --> 6084.719
fine sand dust could potentially do that

6083.04 --> 6086.56
not sure

6084.719 --> 6088.88
but it would certainly be better than

6086.56 --> 6090.84
some kind of a metal

6088.88 --> 6093.52
dust you

6090.84 --> 6094.719
know do you have to declare

6093.52 --> 6098.0
i

6094.719 --> 6098.0
don't know don't care

6100.08 --> 6103.36
i'm taking it as a gift

6103.44 --> 6106.638999999999
i have to declare

6105.04 --> 6108.96
my income

6106.639 --> 6111.6
from google

6108.96 --> 6114.6
and i do do that

6111.6 --> 6114.6
cycle

6132.0 --> 6135.04
eric was the leading

6135.36 --> 6139.679
that's a long that's like the 80s or

6137.04 --> 6139.679
something right

6141.04 --> 6144.44
and that's different

6172.4 --> 6177.4
right

6174.4 --> 6177.4
check

6190.8 --> 6192.96
oh

6193.04 --> 6198.4
okay cycle

6196.08 --> 6198.4
sure

6198.48 --> 6202.239
depends on how big like i don't really

6200.4 --> 6204.799999999999

6202.239 --> 6206.32
