system join button away

116.22 --> 122.759
hey it's mirrored join button it's more

120.6 --> 125.28
over there by the way but anyway

122.759 --> 127.14
it's a mirrored situation I had I just

125.28 --> 130.56
picked up on that okay

127.14 --> 130.56
right uh

133.44 --> 136.819
right so

135.78 --> 141.36
hello

136.819 --> 143.57999999999998
uh the weather today is

141.36 --> 145.92000000000002
beautiful it's salt changed around it's

143.58 --> 149.04000000000002
kind of bluish

145.92 --> 151.26
some minor Trail remnants being left but

149.04 --> 154.85999999999999
it's not really serious and

151.26 --> 157.2
barely any clouds just a lot of sun

154.86 --> 160.5
very little wind

157.2 --> 163.01899999999998
still cold outside of the Sun so in here

160.5 --> 166.08
it's kind of cool now but

163.019 --> 168.54
in the sun it's really beautiful and all

166.08 --> 170.58
that snow because it's been massively

168.54 --> 174.44
snowing yesterday

170.58 --> 174.44000000000003
is pretty much all melted

174.959 --> 179.81900000000002
all right anyway

176.64 --> 182.57999999999998
for anybody that hasn't noticed yet

179.819 --> 184.67999999999998
you might want to open your eyes because

182.58 --> 187.64000000000001
I have a guest here

184.68 --> 190.86
yeah a mute hello

187.64 --> 194.51899999999998
welcome back this time on camera

190.86 --> 196.739
yep uh yeah could you by the way maybe

194.519 --> 199.739
slightly tilt your camera some because

196.739 --> 203.4
your head's getting cut off this one yes

199.739 --> 205.08
just slightly okay so that you can move

203.4 --> 208.68
around and not have your top of your

205.08 --> 213.06
head cut off it's because of the Skype

208.68 --> 217.31900000000002
setting Skype is very tricky with

213.06 --> 219.36
yeah with how you can represent you but

217.319 --> 220.56
anyway I got you on and the sound's all

219.36 --> 223.62
working

220.56 --> 225.48
so I am very happy about that even

223.62 --> 228.019
though it's very weird to be all Mirror

225.48 --> 228.01899999999998
Image now

228.12 --> 233.58
because now it is actually like that

231.36 --> 235.98000000000002
side really is that side and

233.58 --> 239.15900000000002
for some reason when I do it through OBS

235.98 --> 241.98
it's always the other way around

239.159 --> 243.54
well it works just fine I guess yeah

241.98 --> 246.35999999999999
it's no problem it's not a real problem

243.54 --> 247.79899999999998
it's just like it just looks it looks so

246.36 --> 250.26000000000002
mirror imaged

247.799 --> 252.9
so weird to see the thing they're

250.26 --> 255.35999999999999
actually moving exactly the way that I'm

252.9 --> 256.979
moving like that because normally it's

255.36 --> 259.79900000000004
the other way around though anyway

256.979 --> 262.139
that's this is silly right so how are

259.799 --> 264.84
you doing man good to have you back yeah

262.139 --> 266.88
not too bad uh I've been very busy

264.84 --> 270.11999999999995
lately yeah so that's why I haven't been

266.88 --> 272.21999999999997
able to tune in every day but uh yeah

270.12 --> 273.9
this week I've been able to tune in for

272.22 --> 276.12
a little bit and uh

273.9 --> 279.419
all right yeah all right basically I'm

276.12 --> 281.88
just cruising and saving up money for

279.419 --> 283.56
the summer and just uh working a lot

281.88 --> 285.36
basically that's it

283.56 --> 287.479
saving up money for summer are you

285.36 --> 291.6
planning summer vacations

287.479 --> 296.28
uh yes uh yeah yeah actually I'm gonna

291.6 --> 298.62
go to Indonesia oh to uh Bali oh wow uh

296.28 --> 301.85999999999996
not that I've I've been there already

298.62 --> 304.919
I actually lived there for a year but um

301.86 --> 307.199
my father is going and um

304.919 --> 310.25899999999996
I I wouldn't particularly go someplace

307.199 --> 313.139
I've I'd spend so much time already but

310.259 --> 315.54
my father's getting old and he asked me

313.139 --> 317.16
if I wanted to go and at first I said no

315.54 --> 319.86
I'm not really interested then I started

317.16 --> 321.90000000000003
to think like yeah maybe one of the last

319.86 --> 324.18
times that I can actually do something

321.9 --> 326.15999999999997
like this with my dad so

324.18 --> 328.139
I was like yeah actually I really should

326.16 --> 330.41900000000004
is he that cold

328.139 --> 332.039
it's not that it's that old but he's

330.419 --> 335.15999999999997
starting to get old and it's not gonna

332.039 --> 337.139
happen I'm gonna go on vacation with him

335.16 --> 338.699
every year like this no no of course I

337.139 --> 343.199
get it no but I'm just wondering like

338.699 --> 345.479
because you know my father is uh 67. oh

343.199 --> 348.12
okay yeah right

345.479 --> 351.3
but because like you can get really old

348.12 --> 353.58
at 67 or you could not really get all

351.3 --> 355.62
that old it all depends right especially

353.58 --> 358.02
with Indonesians it's

355.62 --> 360.539
well when I get it I I mean I have the

358.02 --> 364.02
same reflex with my dad like he is like

360.539 --> 366.0
70 now and I'm like but he's extremely

364.02 --> 367.44
vital that's the weird thing I often

366.0 --> 369.96
like think like oh my God he's getting

367.44 --> 371.58
old but then I'm hanging around or

369.96 --> 372.73999999999995
talking with him and he's like not at

371.58 --> 375.539
all at all

372.74 --> 377.46000000000004
but that might be different with your

375.539 --> 379.139
dad I don't know how regularly you're

377.46 --> 381.59999999999997
communicating no he's still he's still

379.139 --> 383.88
very fit he goes to the gym and all oh

381.6 --> 385.74
really that stuff but wow yeah you know

383.88 --> 388.02
actually you know he likes running a lot

385.74 --> 389.46000000000004
so he runs a lot when it's [ __ ] whether

388.02 --> 392.21999999999997
he goes to the gym when it's nice

389.46 --> 396.23999999999995
weather like this he just goes up

392.22 --> 399.0
um but uh I've had people in my family

396.24 --> 401.039
that seemed fit and young and just died

399.0 --> 402.6
of a stroke all of a sudden you know so

401.039 --> 403.919
when that happens you start thinking

402.6 --> 406.91900000000004
especially when you get older yourself

403.919 --> 409.85999999999996
like maybe I should take advantage of

406.919 --> 411.9
this opportunity to go someplace we we

409.86 --> 414.72
might both enjoy especially since I've

411.9 --> 418.73999999999995
been there for so long right also show

414.72 --> 421.139
him stuff well sleep so I can basically

418.74 --> 423.66
give you some I guess sort of spiritual

421.139 --> 426.90000000000003
advice concerning that sort of thing of

423.66 --> 430.139
like seeming fit and then suddenly dying

426.9 --> 432.59999999999997
right because it all depends on when

430.139 --> 434.46000000000004
you're older how much of what you've

432.6 --> 436.62
been carrying around and the mistakes

434.46 --> 438.9
you made how much of that baggage you've

436.62 --> 440.699
been able to resolve and a lot of other

438.9 --> 442.38
people like feel like they can't really

440.699 --> 444.06
do anything about it anymore and then

442.38 --> 446.71999999999997
they keep everything back they're like

444.06 --> 450.419
no you're the youth right that you're

446.72 --> 452.16
I'm just gonna not complain not share my

450.419 --> 454.62
baggage and you just do your thing well

452.16 --> 456.78000000000003
those types of people they're typically

454.62 --> 459.12
the ones that suddenly die like of a

456.78 --> 461.039
stroke because they are not resolving

459.12 --> 464.4
their issues anymore yes they get older

461.039 --> 466.8
so you can yeah so is your dad that type

464.4 --> 470.4
is he like no I love you everything's

466.8 --> 472.8
good don't worry about me because then

470.4 --> 475.44
yeah you might want to actually kind of

472.8 --> 477.539
dig a little like hey are there things

475.44 --> 480.12
that you're actually sitting on that you

477.539 --> 482.699
should be resolving but you think nah no

480.12 --> 484.86
I'm doing like lately he's uh or is he

482.699 --> 488.40000000000003
very upfront right because you're very

484.86 --> 490.5
upfront dying suddenly is rare there uh

488.4 --> 492.84
no he he is a friend but he's starting

490.5 --> 495.12
lately he's starting to like second

492.84 --> 500.039
guess certain choices that he's made and

495.12 --> 502.379
he's uh asking me like uh did did I did

500.039 --> 504.96
I disappoint you then and then or did I

502.379 --> 507.24
handle that and that well enough which

504.96 --> 508.44
he didn't because my father used to be

507.24 --> 512.76
an alcoholic

508.44 --> 514.56
so he made but he's waking up wow so now

512.76 --> 516.06
he's starting to that's why you know

514.56 --> 518.279
that's awesome

516.06 --> 519.959
trying to get to spend more time with

518.279 --> 522.0
his kids and his grandkids because my

519.959 --> 524.3389999999999
brother has little kids I don't but my

522.0 --> 526.5
brother does so now he's starting to get

524.339 --> 530.399
out of it and it also helps that he

526.5 --> 532.68
divorced his uh well now ex-wife who was

530.399 --> 534.959
an even worse alcoholic so that kind of

532.68 --> 536.76
dragged him into it and you know you

534.959 --> 539.6999999999999
know long story short he's out of it and

536.76 --> 541.98
uh now I'm starting to think like yeah I

539.7 --> 544.5
should I should do stuff like that but

541.98 --> 546.9590000000001
that's great man that's I'm that's

544.5 --> 550.32
pretty thrilling to hear like

546.959 --> 552.54
I mean an alcoholic that's tough and to

550.32 --> 556.019
actually get out of that and then kind

552.54 --> 557.8199999999999
of reawaken that's often very rare

556.019 --> 561.24
people that are alcoholics their entire

557.82 --> 564.1800000000001
lives or big parts of that they often

561.24 --> 566.94
like lose their own personality because

564.18 --> 569.64
it literally just burns out it yeah so

566.94 --> 572.339
if he's like Reawakening that's that's

569.64 --> 574.68
awesome that's kind of Lucky I'd say I

572.339 --> 577.1400000000001
think it started when we're in uh he

574.68 --> 579.06
became Granddad for the first time

577.14 --> 580.98
I think that's the

579.06 --> 582.899
that's why it's when it started that's

580.98 --> 584.399
when it started to kind of drop and or

582.899 --> 587.76
kind of hit him

584.399 --> 591.3
and uh started thinking like I I wasted

587.76 --> 594.06
the Youth of my other kids being drunk

591.3 --> 598.0799999999999
so let's not do that a second time

594.06 --> 600.5999999999999
that's that's really cool man yeah

598.08 --> 604.26
right yeah thanks for sharing that no

600.6 --> 605.76
worries it's all good right uh let's say

604.26 --> 607.5
hello to the people in chat and I

605.76 --> 610.3199999999999
haven't done that yet I love steamy

607.5 --> 613.92
traveler first in chat Terra 306 Richard

610.32 --> 616.019
G evil nightmare good to see you and by

613.92 --> 618.4799999999999
the way it is Saturday the 11th of March

616.019 --> 619.92
2023

618.48 --> 624.62
ah

619.92 --> 624.62
yeah so how are you guys doing out there

625.019 --> 628.5
stess is going to be on with me like the

626.94 --> 631.2600000000001
first hour and then it's got to go again

628.5 --> 633.18
but yeah

631.26 --> 636.54
so I'm gonna basically give you the

633.18 --> 639.12
floor what did you want to talk about

636.54 --> 641.88
well like there's so there's so much

639.12 --> 644.279
weird stuff going on lately there's a

641.88 --> 647.04
lot of stuff to talk about it I guess

644.279 --> 649.32
what direction right so let's just start

647.04 --> 651.7199999999999
the direction and because yeah there's a

649.32 --> 655.019
lot everywhere but

651.72 --> 656.9590000000001
where to start like uh did you know

655.019 --> 660.18
there's a farmer's protest right now

656.959 --> 662.3599999999999
yeah yeah and that they're literally the

660.18 --> 666.5999999999999
military is like barricading entire

662.36 --> 669.839
Mainline streets with military trucks

666.6 --> 673.2
like it's uh it's fun it's I think if

669.839 --> 676.44
they're overreacting a little bit yeah

673.2 --> 678.36
I feel like it's a very unnecessary you

676.44 --> 681.72
know to

678.36 --> 683.519
actually like they they they pulled a

681.72 --> 685.6800000000001
couple of trucks or a couple of tractors

683.519 --> 687.36
off the off the public roads but it was

685.68 --> 689.8199999999999
just like a handful it wasn't like they

687.36 --> 692.4590000000001
were coming with the hundreds so these

689.82 --> 695.72
people just went to protest without the

692.459 --> 698.18
tractors which is fine I suppose right

695.72 --> 701.1600000000001
uh yeah

698.18 --> 703.4399999999999
to use the art it's such a show of force

701.16 --> 705.7199999999999
it kind of makes them look worse than

703.44 --> 709.0790000000001
they might have intended to I I guess

705.72 --> 711.62
yeah well also all that stuff that

709.079 --> 714.2399999999999
they're doing that all cost money right

711.62 --> 716.04
deploying the military that costs money

714.24 --> 718.5600000000001
like oh this is ridiculous there's

716.04 --> 721.86
literally spending money because people

718.56 --> 726.0189999999999
are protesting for basically being

721.86 --> 729.12
squished financially and being yeah

726.019 --> 731.82
so they're literally spending their

729.12 --> 735.24
money to prevent them

731.82 --> 737.82
from protesting about getting robbed by

735.24 --> 739.44
them that's literally what's going on

737.82 --> 741.839
yeah

739.44 --> 744.36
yeah that is I think to see they seem to

741.839 --> 747.12
think it's normal like people that

744.36 --> 749.279
decide that as well like they're

747.12 --> 752.279
starting to beat down on protests more

749.279 --> 754.74
and more and it's been the way it's been

752.279 --> 756.18
like this in Canada as well I think and

754.74 --> 758.04
in other countries where they're

756.18 --> 760.8599999999999
starting to

758.04 --> 763.019
not tolerate protests as much as they

760.86 --> 765.72
might have used to except for friends

763.019 --> 768.24
because friends has you know always been

765.72 --> 769.9200000000001
a country of protests it's just

768.24 --> 772.32
something they do it's something which

769.92 --> 773.16
is in their culture a little bit more

772.32 --> 775.44
than

773.16 --> 778.26
for example in in the Netherlands I

775.44 --> 781.62
guess we're a bit in general the Dutch

778.26 --> 784.139
are a little bit more submissive to the

781.62 --> 786.18
government I think easy going I'd say

784.139 --> 788.88
not submissive because if the government

786.18 --> 791.0999999999999
says you have to do this then that

788.88 --> 793.4399999999999
people don't typically like to do it but

791.1 --> 795.6
if there is a plan we're very like oh

793.44 --> 798.3000000000001
yeah go with the plan right we're

795.6 --> 801.0
trusting at first right what I think as

798.3 --> 804.39
well is that the the the the politicians

801.0 --> 804.72
in Holland are very

804.39 --> 805.74
[Music]

804.72 --> 808.8000000000001
um

805.74 --> 811.2
careful with the words they use when

808.8 --> 813.0
they give interviews and when they are

811.2 --> 815.82
very careful they're very well very

813.0 --> 819.36
measured in bringing something

815.82 --> 822.1800000000001
which might be very bad for everyone and

819.36 --> 825.779
then packaging it in such a way that it

822.18 --> 828.8
seems not so bad right this is what I've

825.779 --> 831.8389999999999
noticed in in difference to other

828.8 --> 833.8389999999999
politicians in other countries they they

831.839 --> 837.12
very much

833.839 --> 840.3000000000001
uh make a bad deal look

837.12 --> 841.74
better than it is to get people to you

840.3 --> 843.779
know because that's what class that's

841.74 --> 846.839
originally what real politicians did

843.779 --> 849.66
right it's like you over exaggerated the

846.839 --> 852.4200000000001
insignificant and you downplay the

849.66 --> 854.579
extreme that's what the real politicians

852.42 --> 857.279
used to do but a lot of politicians out

854.579 --> 860.8199999999999
there now seem to be more concerned

857.279 --> 862.2
about mind controlling a bunch of herd

860.82 --> 864.6
of dumb people

862.2 --> 866.5790000000001
like they're more trying to roll out

864.6 --> 868.8000000000001
some narrative for people to latch onto

866.579 --> 870.899
than that they're actually addressing

868.8 --> 873.4799999999999
the real situations and trying to twist

870.899 --> 877.1
it around to stabilize things like

873.48 --> 880.26
actual politicians originally do

877.1 --> 883.0790000000001
but in the Netherlands they still are

880.26 --> 885.54
very they're I guess higher quality

883.079 --> 886.92
politician but yeah in worst position

885.54 --> 888.899
and

886.92 --> 891.62
it's really horrific what they're

888.899 --> 894.3
actually doing with their quality

891.62 --> 897.48
politicizing well I think it's pretty

894.3 --> 900.06
obvious if if you take two extremes for

897.48 --> 902.22
example politicians in in the US if you

900.06 --> 905.699
compare them to politicians in general

902.22 --> 907.339
like there's exceptions obviously but I

905.699 --> 909.959
don't I don't think you're it's it's

907.339 --> 912.839
very much required to have a certain

909.959 --> 915.8389999999999
level of of Education to be able to

912.839 --> 917.2790000000001
partake in in U.S politics I think the

915.839 --> 919.399
standards in Holland are a little bit

917.279 --> 922.8
higher you have to yeah

919.399 --> 925.86
an own business or a University degree

922.8 --> 927.4799999999999
to to be able to decide for you know

925.86 --> 929.339
basically millions of people or a

927.48 --> 932.399
hundred thousands of people and in the

929.339 --> 933.9590000000001
US if you're popular enough it doesn't

932.399 --> 935.579
really matter you know if you're popular

933.959 --> 937.16
enough if you can get the people that

935.579 --> 939.7199999999999
vote for you

937.16 --> 941.76
it doesn't really matter anybody can can

939.72 --> 943.74
become a president and that's you know

941.76 --> 947.779
right in that place you get nitpicked

943.74 --> 947.779
right that's the problem here

948.32 --> 954.12
they put you under such a loop that you

952.38 --> 956.699
literally get nitpicked to death before

954.12 --> 960.48
you even get off the ground so popular

956.699 --> 962.519
populism is like real they really like

960.48 --> 964.0790000000001
strangle that here

962.519 --> 965.4590000000001
it's always been the issue with like

964.079 --> 969.54
well the popular party the

965.459 --> 973.38
counterparties PVP which has its issues

969.54 --> 976.56
the form for democracy with which has

973.38 --> 979.92
much less issues but they get like so

976.56 --> 983.8389999999999
violently assaulted verbally make out

979.92 --> 987.66
for [ __ ] when when they're really

983.839 --> 991.98
so subtle and well behaved actually it's

987.66 --> 994.199
crazy it's it's it's it becomes it

991.98 --> 996.12
becomes weird when when politicians

994.199 --> 998.3389999999999
start attacking them on a personal level

996.12 --> 1000.5600000000001
instead of at home of what they're

998.339 --> 1002.4200000000001
saying it's it's like a diversion like

1000.56 --> 1003.579
it's well they're saying they're like

1002.42 --> 1007.04
Flat Earth

1003.579 --> 1009.68
so let's discredit him in such a way or

1007.04 --> 1011.36
you know discredible in such a way that

1009.68 --> 1013.0999999999999
the speaker of the I don't know what

1011.36 --> 1015.74
it's called but the one that tells

1013.1 --> 1017.72
somebody to speak or not to speak that

1015.74 --> 1020.72
he that they found it necessary to tell

1017.72 --> 1023.72
him to basically shut up for two days

1020.72 --> 1026.54
right yeah they like the muzzle yeah

1023.72 --> 1028.52
people yeah in politics that go yeah but

1026.54 --> 1032.48
that's that's where like the uniformity

1028.52 --> 1034.22
of the the new world or the the cartel

1032.48 --> 1037.28
is

1034.22 --> 1039.8600000000001
they are just appealing to a group

1037.28 --> 1042.26
priorities group mechanics socially

1039.86 --> 1046.3999999999999
that's like the only they're like a hive

1042.26 --> 1048.5
they really are a hive format group and

1046.4 --> 1050.6000000000001
they don't give a [ __ ] about what's true

1048.5 --> 1052.22
or not it's just about power it's just

1050.6 --> 1053.84
about the hive really and it's getting

1052.22 --> 1056.539
so overt

1053.84 --> 1058.6999999999998
because even when they try to make

1056.539 --> 1060.74
excuses it just kind of unravels and

1058.7 --> 1063.679
they're like yeah whatever man yeah it

1060.74 --> 1065.1200000000001
doesn't make sense who cares we're doing

1063.679 --> 1068.24
it anyway

1065.12 --> 1071.12
right so it's just Hive they're a hive

1068.24 --> 1071.96
they don't really care anymore about the

1071.12 --> 1074.2399999999998
truth

1071.96 --> 1076.7
or about principles that just want that

1074.24 --> 1078.28
power and they just want everybody to do

1076.7 --> 1082.88
what they say

1078.28 --> 1086.48
well I find it hard sometimes because

1082.88 --> 1090.679
to really decide like what what what

1086.48 --> 1092.059
what is the end game or or is there is

1090.679 --> 1094.7
there even an end game are they just

1092.059 --> 1097.1
going along with what Europe wants and

1094.7 --> 1099.0800000000002
what the US wants if you look at no no

1097.1 --> 1100.82
no Ukrainian thing that's going on as

1099.08 --> 1102.9189999999999
well but that's part of it that's all

1100.82 --> 1105.74
just part of the doubling down the

1102.919 --> 1107.3600000000001
scheming to keep it going to keep the

1105.74 --> 1110.419
money flowing to keep everybody

1107.36 --> 1112.2199999999998
distracted right but it is a power game

1110.419 --> 1114.74
and they are

1112.22 --> 1117.08
whether they realize it they might have

1114.74 --> 1119.66
a misformed idea of what it's going to

1117.08 --> 1123.4399999999998
become but a lot of them really do know

1119.66 --> 1126.679
not they are agents of hell and they are

1123.44 --> 1128.66
going to destroy the human mind the

1126.679 --> 1131.48
human spirit and turn the world into

1128.66 --> 1135.46
1984 where literally nobody has a right

1131.48 --> 1135.46
to do anything but to kill themselves

1135.94 --> 1140.1200000000001
that's what they want and there are

1138.2 --> 1141.74
people out there in control positions

1140.12 --> 1145.78
that really

1141.74 --> 1145.78
like honestly want that

1146.299 --> 1152.0
yeah because they just hate everybody

1149.66 --> 1153.919
because the world can be the way they

1152.0 --> 1157.22
want it to be I don't know what the

1153.919 --> 1161.2990000000002
motives are man that us you know

1157.22 --> 1162.98
yeah it's it's it's hard to say like you

1161.299 --> 1165.44
have that thing going on obviously in

1162.98 --> 1166.76
Ukraine with Russia and the US and uh

1165.44 --> 1168.44
you know all that all that stuff going

1166.76 --> 1170.6
which is escalating pretty quickly if

1168.44 --> 1172.52
you ask me well it's by the impression

1170.6 --> 1175.7199999999998
yeah but then you've got all these

1172.52 --> 1178.28
things going in the US itself as well

1175.72 --> 1180.14
politically seen like what the hell is

1178.28 --> 1182.6
going on with all these trains and

1180.14 --> 1186.0800000000002
chemical spills it's not just one or two

1182.6 --> 1188.24
it's like 12 in a week you know one

1186.08 --> 1190.52
after the other is it or is it the US is

1188.24 --> 1192.679
being destroyed it was on the agenda

1190.52 --> 1194.9
yeah and they're wrecking it in every

1192.679 --> 1196.88
way I literally predicted this I

1194.9 --> 1200.299
predicted this like two years ago like

1196.88 --> 1203.8400000000001
us that's why I'm getting angry like why

1200.299 --> 1205.7
aren't you upholding your vow of the

1203.84 --> 1208.76
Second Amendment because they are going

1205.7 --> 1210.799
to destroy everything oh you think

1208.76 --> 1213.14
you're safe with your guns in in the

1210.799 --> 1215.299
middle of nowhere they'll make sure that

1213.14 --> 1217.64
eventually everything dies around you

1215.299 --> 1219.98
well with the American government sold

1217.64 --> 1221.0
it I called it and now they're literally

1219.98 --> 1224.78
just

1221.0 --> 1226.64
poisoning everything yeah so and it's on

1224.78 --> 1228.5
purpose they want to destroy it they

1226.64 --> 1231.44
want to destroy everything they want to

1228.5 --> 1234.38
ruin the people even if that leaves a

1231.44 --> 1236.0
giant waste dump of a land

1234.38 --> 1237.679
they don't care

1236.0 --> 1239.72
yeah because they have their

1237.679 --> 1241.5800000000002
contingencies I suppose they have their

1239.72 --> 1244.58
places where they can go to when when

1241.58 --> 1247.3999999999999
[ __ ] hits the fan I I guess well they're

1244.58 --> 1249.32
not part of America really anymore right

1247.4 --> 1252.14
no they're just they have their

1249.32 --> 1253.76
citizenship and they're abusing it and

1252.14 --> 1255.38
they're screwing things up but they

1253.76 --> 1258.74
don't give a [ __ ] about that country

1255.38 --> 1261.14
it's it's a giant trash Heap to them

1258.74 --> 1263.9
they don't care if it all dies they

1261.14 --> 1266.2990000000002
don't care so yeah like what is I'm

1263.9 --> 1269.72
gonna open that link uh courts that I

1266.299 --> 1271.58
just uh uh split in chat like oh right

1269.72 --> 1273.52
yeah the state I've seen this yeah yeah

1271.58 --> 1278.4189999999999
I've seen this I've seen that a little

1273.52 --> 1280.7
so how can that be in a functioning

1278.419 --> 1284.179
railroad it looks like spaghetti it

1280.7 --> 1286.46
looked like it's I shouldn't laugh

1284.179 --> 1288.919
actually because it's the state of these

1286.46 --> 1290.9
tracks is deplorable but it looks like

1288.919 --> 1293.96
spaghetti what the hell like how can you

1290.9 --> 1297.38
eat it's better than the average uh bad

1293.96 --> 1300.2
regions of India railroad that was just

1297.38 --> 1302.2990000000002
about to say that I'd seen weird [ __ ]

1300.2 --> 1305.24
from because they have accidents with

1302.299 --> 1306.98
railroads but they don't use railroads

1305.24 --> 1310.159
like this because they are not

1306.98 --> 1312.679
deliberately self-sabotaging yeah I

1310.159 --> 1316.4
guess they maybe they're just cheap and

1312.679 --> 1318.3200000000002
poor and they push it that's what India

1316.4 --> 1321.22
does right yeah

1318.32 --> 1323.8999999999999
the Amer this is on purpose this is like

1321.22 --> 1326.72
somebody exploiting it

1323.9 --> 1330.14
like not making money off of making

1326.72 --> 1332.419
money of the neglect of it and everybody

1330.14 --> 1335.48
else being corrupt and just keeping that

1332.419 --> 1337.5800000000002
in place because they all know this is

1335.48 --> 1340.22
going to lead to a disaster and

1337.58 --> 1341.4189999999999
everybody surrounding it let it happen I

1340.22 --> 1343.64
mean

1341.419 --> 1346.039
well it was even that freaking Village

1343.64 --> 1348.0200000000002
just let it happen I mean it's right

1346.039 --> 1350.6
there it's right next to them they know

1348.02 --> 1354.26
it's there it's there on a daily basis

1350.6 --> 1357.74
and they just all sit there do nothing

1354.26 --> 1360.02
nobody does anything about anything in

1357.74 --> 1363.08
the United States you see because nobody

1360.02 --> 1364.7
gives a [ __ ] until it's too late the

1363.08 --> 1366.4399999999998
people living there is there there's

1364.7 --> 1369.3400000000001
there's not so much there's not very

1366.44 --> 1372.6200000000001
much they can do except leave I suppose

1369.34 --> 1376.1589999999999
but no there's much more like this all

1372.62 --> 1379.3999999999999
these all these all these like the the

1376.159 --> 1381.5
bad State the real real world network is

1379.4 --> 1382.7800000000002
in in the US from what I've seen is

1381.5 --> 1386.36
because of

1382.78 --> 1388.6399999999999
budget cuts and restraints longer trains

1386.36 --> 1390.6789999999999
less personal it's all horseshit that's

1388.64 --> 1393.5590000000002
all political blabbermouth excuse it's

1390.679 --> 1396.02
not true it's literally not true because

1393.559 --> 1397.6399999999999
those railroads are privately owned

1396.02 --> 1400.58
effectively well exactly with the

1397.64 --> 1402.7990000000002
responsibility and nobody does anything

1400.58 --> 1405.6789999999999
about it so it's not true something's

1402.799 --> 1408.02
privately owned and and a profit is the

1405.679 --> 1410.48
main goal safety is one of the first

1408.02 --> 1413.12
first things to to basically be

1410.48 --> 1414.919
abandoned so they go for a lot of

1413.12 --> 1417.02
profits right until [ __ ] like this

1414.919 --> 1418.64
happens maybe it's been happening for a

1417.02 --> 1420.62
long time it's just getting a lot more

1418.64 --> 1422.24
exposure now it's been happening for

1420.62 --> 1424.34
hundreds of years since the

1422.24 --> 1425.679
industrialization this sort of [ __ ] has

1424.34 --> 1429.6789999999999
been happening in the United States

1425.679 --> 1431.7800000000002
chemical spills happen all the time

1429.679 --> 1434.0590000000002
that's why when this happened I was like

1431.78 --> 1436.4189999999999
oh yeah well no no it's the end of the

1434.059 --> 1438.799
world no that freaking that like happens

1436.419 --> 1441.0200000000002
every few years

1438.799 --> 1443.84
well the one in Ohio was pretty severe

1441.02 --> 1446.059
yeah but that's because they blew it up

1443.84 --> 1448.76
because that you're they did something

1446.059 --> 1451.76
that you were absolutely not supposed to

1448.76 --> 1454.64
do under any circumstances so it's a

1451.76 --> 1456.919
deliberate sabotage yeah they leave it

1454.64 --> 1460.0590000000002
on fire and that that when you do that

1456.919 --> 1462.919
it changes it changes into a

1460.059 --> 1465.5
hydrochloric acid or some [ __ ] like that

1462.919 --> 1467.6000000000001
and that if it turns into a the one of

1465.5 --> 1470.6
the worst chemicals possible that's

1467.6 --> 1472.52
really hard to clean up the the the the

1470.6 --> 1474.74
worst thing about it is that I think

1472.52 --> 1477.98
it's it's right it happened right above

1474.74 --> 1481.159
this a huge underwater Basin which is

1477.98 --> 1483.34
connected to some River so if if the

1481.159 --> 1488.6200000000001
chemicals seep into that that

1483.34 --> 1488.62
contaminates like a huge supply of water

1490.539 --> 1494.72
and everybody's okay with that I know

1492.98 --> 1496.76
there's a privately owned railroad it's

1494.72 --> 1499.58
right next to an aquifer oh what do the

1496.76 --> 1502.22
chances it go wrong oh oh it's just such

1499.58 --> 1504.5
a small percentage I mean it can just

1502.22 --> 1507.679
though right most of the so everybody

1504.5 --> 1509.96
has been looking at that forever all the

1507.679 --> 1512.659
people involved in any indirect way

1509.96 --> 1515.24
responsible for that entire situ

1512.659 --> 1518.24
situation should go to jail like every

1515.24 --> 1520.039
single one of them obviously right but

1518.24 --> 1523.58
they never do because it's the United

1520.039 --> 1526.22
States and nobody gives a [ __ ] literally

1523.58 --> 1528.62
only if it's some political interest

1526.22 --> 1531.08
will somebody go and push something

1528.62 --> 1533.9599999999998
around for a bit put somebody in jail

1531.08 --> 1537.5
it's only political because if it's not

1533.96 --> 1540.02
political nobody gives a [ __ ] well you

1537.5 --> 1541.94
know like they'll everybody surrounding

1540.02 --> 1544.7
there will be very happy to just let

1541.94 --> 1547.46
people die because of neglect

1544.7 --> 1549.0800000000002
it was pretty obvious when nobody from

1547.46 --> 1551.9
the government really paid attention to

1549.08 --> 1554.0
it for in the first what 10 days

1551.9 --> 1554.8400000000001
it took them like 10 days to even you

1554.0 --> 1557.6
know

1554.84 --> 1559.3999999999999
sort of uh yeah

1557.6 --> 1561.86
I don't know

1559.4 --> 1565.279
it's just a weird thing like okay so you

1561.86 --> 1566.84
know to come to come back to to the

1565.279 --> 1570.32
general

1566.84 --> 1572.4189999999999
point is that there's a lot of weird

1570.32 --> 1574.82
things going on in an accelerating Pace

1572.419 --> 1577.1200000000001
it seems to me you know which makes me

1574.82 --> 1579.6399999999999
think like you know I don't know

1577.12 --> 1583.039
the neglect has been running long

1579.64 --> 1584.96
generational multi-generational and now

1583.039 --> 1587.48
they're letting it Blow and then they're

1584.96 --> 1589.46
going to scoop Up the Bodies effectively

1587.48 --> 1591.679
they're gonna let everybody die let this

1589.46 --> 1593.24
happen hey and you're saying what you

1591.679 --> 1594.5590000000002
said earlier I wanted silver response to

1593.24 --> 1596.059
that like oh the people in the village

1594.559 --> 1598.34
you couldn't have done anything oh

1596.059 --> 1599.96
really they could have done nothing

1598.34 --> 1602.36
I could think of something they could

1599.96 --> 1604.4
have done before this all happened

1602.36 --> 1606.5
looking at the railroads is right there

1604.4 --> 1607.52
knowing what could happen you know what

1606.5 --> 1608.96
they could do

1607.52 --> 1612.039
they could

1608.96 --> 1615.919
get rid of the railroad

1612.039 --> 1619.4
literally saw it out and like yeah oh we

1615.919 --> 1621.7990000000002
sabotaged the railroad yeah so now you

1619.4 --> 1624.02
have to [ __ ] replace it you idiots or

1621.799 --> 1625.82
you can't use it anymore because now

1624.02 --> 1628.4
there's not even a wobbly spaghetti

1625.82 --> 1630.74
railroad there's no railroad what the

1628.4 --> 1632.179
[ __ ] are you gonna do then stupid cheap

1630.74 --> 1634.22
ass company

1632.179 --> 1636.14
what are you gonna do now yeah there's

1634.22 --> 1638.059
no more railroad we removed it because

1636.14 --> 1639.74
it's too dangerous and you won't do it

1638.059 --> 1641.6589999999999
so what are you gonna do not use the

1639.74 --> 1643.1
train anymore oh you're not gonna make

1641.659 --> 1644.6000000000001
your precious profit yeah so you're

1643.1 --> 1648.6399999999999
gonna have to build a [ __ ] new

1644.6 --> 1653.02
railroad then you dick sorry maybe maybe

1648.64 --> 1653.0200000000002
yeah that could be a solution I suppose

1653.799 --> 1659.26
yeah but if it's a disaster waiting to

1656.48 --> 1663.02
happen well then break it

1659.26 --> 1664.46
overtly so that it can not like oh so an

1663.02 --> 1666.559
accident happens but literally like

1664.46 --> 1669.38
remove it so it's very overt like oh

1666.559 --> 1672.22
this oh yeah now we what are we gonna do

1669.38 --> 1677.3600000000001
put back the shitty spaghetti railroad

1672.22 --> 1679.88
or just oh new one oh

1677.36 --> 1682.34
how [ __ ] difficult can this be I mean

1679.88 --> 1686.3200000000002
you can do something if people

1682.34 --> 1689.539
responsible are neglecting then do

1686.32 --> 1693.2
sabotage of the very dangerous thing

1689.539 --> 1696.679
that's disable unstable so they are

1693.2 --> 1698.419
forced to replace it yeah I guess I

1696.679 --> 1699.919
guess if I think about there would be a

1698.419 --> 1701.2990000000002
couple of repercussions to think about

1699.919 --> 1704.24
when you start doing that because you

1701.299 --> 1706.76
need a couple of people yeah

1704.24 --> 1708.74
and because you can't like removing a

1706.76 --> 1710.179
railroad is not it's not a simple thing

1708.74 --> 1712.88
you need you need it's not that

1710.179 --> 1714.02
difficult no so you need maybe four

1712.88 --> 1716.72
people

1714.02 --> 1718.8799999999999
and label that and a couple of rows

1716.72 --> 1720.559
little organization and which would mean

1718.88 --> 1723.8600000000001
if they would get caught that would be

1720.559 --> 1726.799
like a heavy oh no you get caught yeah

1723.86 --> 1728.299
yeah sure it's in the middle of nowhere

1726.799 --> 1731.24
what do you think there's cameras around

1728.299 --> 1732.62
the spaghetti roads uh nobody gives a

1731.24 --> 1734.779
[ __ ] that's the whole problem it's

1732.62 --> 1738.6789999999999
neglecting people they will find people

1734.779 --> 1741.679
to to take the fall right so I guess

1738.679 --> 1744.0800000000002
doesn't matter it discontinues the

1741.679 --> 1746.72
dangerous situation and prevents epic

1744.08 --> 1749.36
proportional death causing accidents so

1746.72 --> 1751.34
maybe now somebody will do yeah stuff

1749.36 --> 1753.799
like that I don't know like it could be

1751.34 --> 1755.36
in the Ukraine they did that to stop Uh

1753.799 --> 1757.7
Russian supplies from going through

1755.36 --> 1760.2199999999998
Belarus they they it's I guess it's

1757.7 --> 1761.8400000000001
doable because the the people in Belarus

1760.22 --> 1763.88
did it as well

1761.84 --> 1766.34
so there were they those were

1763.88 --> 1768.0800000000002
individuals that either sabotaged or

1766.34 --> 1769.82
removed parts of the track so they

1768.08 --> 1772.399
couldn't resupply

1769.82 --> 1774.98
right but you can't just like oh

1772.399 --> 1777.4399999999998
sabotage it so an accident happened I'm

1774.98 --> 1779.179
not saying to do that ever no never ever

1777.44 --> 1781.22
and just to clear that up for the

1779.179 --> 1783.5590000000002
audience anybody viewing things like oh

1781.22 --> 1785.6000000000001
you're you're setting people to do

1783.559 --> 1788.6
criminal things no what I'm saying is

1785.6 --> 1790.9399999999998
overtly not sabotage so a giant accident

1788.6 --> 1793.84
happens but just like remove entire

1790.94 --> 1796.46
sections of rails so it's very visible

1793.84 --> 1800.059
you could even like after you've done it

1796.46 --> 1802.779
like hey I just walked by here the

1800.059 --> 1805.22
railroads have been removed company

1802.779 --> 1807.74
Anonymous caller telling you that that

1805.22 --> 1810.02
happened to walk by right no accidents

1807.74 --> 1811.58
have to happen it's just forcing their

1810.02 --> 1814.82
hands to do something about it because

1811.58 --> 1817.8799999999999
after that they can't just continue on

1814.82 --> 1820.1
with the risk see that's the difference

1817.88 --> 1823.5390000000002
you can force their hand if they're

1820.1 --> 1828.08
neglectful you can force their hand

1823.539 --> 1830.84
do it stop sitting by complaining and

1828.08 --> 1832.279
whining on social media and letting it

1830.84 --> 1835.76
all happen and then complaining

1832.279 --> 1837.74
afterwards you [ __ ] freaks take care

1835.76 --> 1839.36
of your damn country you neglect for

1837.74 --> 1842.24
idiots

1839.36 --> 1846.1589999999999
maybe uh maybe they will uh

1842.24 --> 1846.159
I'm not sure what the steps

1846.5 --> 1851.0
try and prevent this probably nothing no

1849.62 --> 1852.86
the people will have to do it because

1851.0 --> 1854.0
the corporations in the government isn't

1852.86 --> 1856.6589999999999
going to do anything I'm not being

1854.0 --> 1856.659
honest sorry

1856.82 --> 1862.399
so do you have any American Watchers uh

1859.279 --> 1864.559
yes I guess Godzilla is American yeah I

1862.399 --> 1867.6789999999999
got plenty of America most of my most of

1864.559 --> 1870.86
my audience is American actually

1867.679 --> 1873.2
so yeah I'm curious of what they think

1870.86 --> 1874.899
of all that stuff going on

1873.2 --> 1876.98
oh Godzilla

1874.899 --> 1879.02
seems to really like what we're talking

1876.98 --> 1881.24
about

1879.02 --> 1884.299
even said I was gonna send me a PayPal

1881.24 --> 1886.96
so I'm gonna check it right now

1884.299 --> 1886.96
America America

1887.179 --> 1892.3400000000001
never throw rocks you know so what what

1890.659 --> 1894.14
what does that mean I don't know that

1892.34 --> 1896.48
expression

1894.14 --> 1898.96
yeah thanks Godzilla for the PayPal much

1896.48 --> 1898.96
appreciated

1904.48 --> 1907.48
all right

1910.039 --> 1915.5
man time is flying we're already halfway

1912.74 --> 1918.2
yeah

1915.5 --> 1921.5
right but yeah anyway I I kind of rolled

1918.2 --> 1923.659
out my Armenian extreme solution I am

1921.5 --> 1926.779
kind of the Revolution yeah I really am

1923.659 --> 1929.8400000000001
I just you know but I I don't care man I

1926.779 --> 1932.24
like if I just look what happened if I'd

1929.84 --> 1934.52
be living in an area like that and [ __ ]

1932.24 --> 1938.8990000000001
like that would happen I would consider

1934.52 --> 1941.5
it a a definitive option

1938.899 --> 1941.5
right

1941.72 --> 1947.0
but I what I don't get is that

1945.08 --> 1949.279
like those people

1947.0 --> 1951.38
all that time have lived there for

1949.279 --> 1954.2
several generations and all of them

1951.38 --> 1956.72
nobody did anything nobody thought of

1954.2 --> 1960.5
this like this what like the kids like

1956.72 --> 1962.72
even if you're like a stupid teenager

1960.5 --> 1966.08
you would probably come up with this and

1962.72 --> 1968.48
then actually do it but nobody's done

1966.08 --> 1971.12
anything makes me think like what the

1968.48 --> 1974.299
[ __ ] is wrong with those people yeah but

1971.12 --> 1976.399
that's like usually when usually things

1974.299 --> 1978.5
have to go real bad before people

1976.399 --> 1980.7199999999998
realize that something that has to

1978.5 --> 1982.34
change right I I don't it sounds stupid

1980.72 --> 1986.059
it is stupid but

1982.34 --> 1988.1
it's the stupid way humans work you know

1986.059 --> 1989.96
we just do something and the difference

1988.1 --> 1993.1999999999998
per country but

1989.96 --> 1995.8400000000001
you know so like that remember that

1993.2 --> 1997.88
whole fireworks incident we had in

1995.84 --> 2000.6
wherever the [ __ ] it was uh whatever it

1997.88 --> 2002.44
was I don't I remember yeah

2000.6 --> 2006.519
exactly yeah

2002.44 --> 2009.279
so this was uh in the middle of a of a

2006.519 --> 2012.279
heavily populated area and there was a a

2009.279 --> 2014.799
warehouse filled with fireworks

2012.279 --> 2016.84
so if you think about that just for a

2014.799 --> 2018.82
second you'd say well it's not a good

2016.84 --> 2021.6999999999998
idea to put a warehouse full of

2018.82 --> 2024.279
fireworks in a heavily populated area

2021.7 --> 2026.32
but yet they did it in a pretty well

2024.279 --> 2028.48
developed country and then you know

2026.32 --> 2030.399
obviously something happened and the

2028.48 --> 2032.32
whole thing blew up along with I don't

2030.399 --> 2034.7199999999998
know how many blocks of you know regular

2032.32 --> 2037.72
housing and that's when they say well

2034.72 --> 2040.539
maybe it would be a good idea to you

2037.72 --> 2043.299
know put that house warehouse not in a

2040.539 --> 2046.179
populated area so I guess it's a little

2043.299 --> 2050.02
bit of human nature in combination with

2046.179 --> 2053.2000000000003
cutting costs and and and and breaking

2050.02 --> 2055.839
or bending regulations

2053.2 --> 2057.52
yeah I don't know exactly like how that

2055.839 --> 2060.04
was even possible

2057.52 --> 2062.619
like how they got away with that

2060.04 --> 2064.899
but it's it I think it was really all

2062.619 --> 2067.599
about corruption I mean those people did

2064.899 --> 2070.419
go to jail and [ __ ] for that yeah no

2067.599 --> 2072.7000000000003
true true so it was basically it was

2070.419 --> 2074.02
effectively illegal for them to do that

2072.7 --> 2076.839
I think

2074.02 --> 2079.419
and what what what Godzilla is saying is

2076.839 --> 2081.119
especially true for for I guess you know

2079.419 --> 2083.5
I don't want to look like

2081.119 --> 2084.8790000000004
talk negative about the United States

2083.5 --> 2087.76
all the time but

2084.879 --> 2090.159
profit and greed is what basically what

2087.76 --> 2092.7400000000002
America runs on so

2090.159 --> 2094.599
yeah obviously what he says is it's true

2092.74 --> 2097.8999999999996
the more spent on infrastructure is less

2094.599 --> 2101.26
in their pockets yeah true you know the

2097.9 --> 2103.2400000000002
greed the greed game in the US is uh

2101.26 --> 2106.0
running uh

2103.24 --> 2108.339
for full speed so so where are the

2106.0 --> 2110.56
standards you know in the Netherlands

2108.339 --> 2112.18
the Netherlands it's different it's like

2110.56 --> 2113.38
it's different [ __ ] about people they

2112.18 --> 2115.0
don't really don't give a [ __ ] about

2113.38 --> 2116.859
people yeah but I'm not talking I'm

2115.0 --> 2119.68
talking not talking I'm basically

2116.859 --> 2122.3199999999997
talking about regulatory standards yeah

2119.68 --> 2123.66
in the Netherlands this [ __ ] could never

2122.32 --> 2126.88
happen

2123.66 --> 2130.0
absolutely impossible why because

2126.88 --> 2134.38
they're not allowed to let it weather

2130.0 --> 2137.5
and get all true it's not allowed like

2134.38 --> 2139.78
you get freaking fines and fines that

2137.5 --> 2141.579
are gonna like gum bigger and bigger

2139.78 --> 2144.2200000000003
like you're not allowed to do that you

2141.579 --> 2148.3590000000004
will not be able to do that here

2144.22 --> 2151.839
that's the difference like why the hell

2148.359 --> 2154.14
don't they do that I mean especially the

2151.839 --> 2158.44
federal government which is for what

2154.14 --> 2160.96
transport and commerce across the states

2158.44 --> 2164.579
so what would be more under their

2160.96 --> 2167.5
jurisdiction than freaking railroads and

2164.579 --> 2170.02
regulations on their quality I don't

2167.5 --> 2174.24
understand this is exactly what they're

2170.02 --> 2175.78
there for and look at what's happening

2174.24 --> 2177.9399999999996
insane

2175.78 --> 2180.7200000000003
from what I know it's in the case of

2177.94 --> 2184.48
like Norfolk Norfolk Southern Railway

2180.72 --> 2185.98
they they are are owned by a couple of

2184.48 --> 2187.359
other companies

2185.98 --> 2189.88
uh

2187.359 --> 2192.22
eventually if you if you if you follow

2189.88 --> 2194.28
the chart to the end they're owned by

2192.22 --> 2196.7799999999997
companies like

2194.28 --> 2198.88
BlackRock and yeah

2196.78 --> 2200.8
like these huge investment companies

2198.88 --> 2203.38
which only caring about profit and

2200.8 --> 2205.3590000000004
that's also from what I've heard one of

2203.38 --> 2208.2400000000002
the reasons why I got neglected in the

2205.359 --> 2211.119
media because these companies also own

2208.24 --> 2213.04
all the major news sites so you know

2211.119 --> 2214.96
putting that in the news would set them

2213.04 --> 2217.06
in a negative light which would you know

2214.96 --> 2220.359
have an influence on possible profits I

2217.06 --> 2222.64
suppose yeah but how does that matter to

2220.359 --> 2224.859
anything if there's regulations and

2222.64 --> 2228.22
they're literally not allowed to neglect

2224.859 --> 2231.64
it then how the hell does it even matter

2228.22 --> 2233.3199999999997
what they want money buys everything you

2231.64 --> 2236.2
know they have a Lobby they just buy

2233.32 --> 2238.48
politicians I suppose it's you know it

2236.2 --> 2240.8799999999997
sounds like a television show but

2238.48 --> 2243.099
sometimes the world seems like a

2240.88 --> 2245.8
television show if you really

2243.099 --> 2247.96
get deep into it you know it's you think

2245.8 --> 2250.3590000000004
it's ridiculous but most ridiculous

2247.96 --> 2252.099
things that they think of actually

2250.359 --> 2254.98
happened right

2252.099 --> 2256.599
so yeah it's it's just it's a crazy

2254.98 --> 2258.4
world man it's a crazy world and that's

2256.599 --> 2261.28
why I'm thinking about all that stuff

2258.4 --> 2263.5
yeah but why is it crazy world it's not

2261.28 --> 2265.7200000000003
a crazy world like that here we have

2263.5 --> 2268.06
crazies that are in power that want

2265.72 --> 2270.3999999999996
things but the way things work that

2268.06 --> 2273.5789999999997
could never happen so what the [ __ ] is

2270.4 --> 2276.82
wrong with America that they just can't

2273.579 --> 2278.8
even get a basic

2276.82 --> 2282.7000000000003
stability going

2278.8 --> 2286.8390000000004
I mean this is a freaking third world

2282.7 --> 2289.0
country issues literally we used to I

2286.839 --> 2290.92
remember still like

2289.0 --> 2294.099
in the Netherlands in the 90s or

2290.92 --> 2296.56
something like shaming India for their

2294.099 --> 2297.82
terrible railroad quality and the

2296.56 --> 2300.5789999999997
accident that would sometimes happen

2297.82 --> 2302.5
like big freighter like big trains all

2300.579 --> 2303.82
stacked with people even on the roofs

2302.5 --> 2305.98
and that they were crashing then there

2303.82 --> 2309.04
would be like a hundred people dead and

2305.98 --> 2311.32
we'd be like this is crazy yeah look at

2309.04 --> 2314.22
freaking America how the hell is that

2311.32 --> 2317.32
different that's a third world country

2314.22 --> 2320.3799999999997
scenario taking place there this is

2317.32 --> 2324.1600000000003
insane you should be so [ __ ] ashamed

2320.38 --> 2326.92
of yourself it's unmeasurable

2324.16 --> 2329.3199999999997
it's but it's not something from it's

2326.92 --> 2332.079
not like a recent development from what

2329.32 --> 2334.48
I uh that's what I mean that's why

2332.079 --> 2337.78
because this is just been in the making

2334.48 --> 2341.2
since basically since the found founding

2337.78 --> 2345.0400000000004
of the US right but it's a like how do

2341.2 --> 2347.3799999999997
you accomplish 200 years of persistent

2345.04 --> 2350.02
neglect to come to that kind of

2347.38 --> 2351.2200000000003
degradation that is just English that

2350.02 --> 2353.619
was the plan of the English all along

2351.22 --> 2356.68
when they discovered this new land and

2353.619 --> 2357.579
possible opportunities to shape the

2356.68 --> 2361.1189999999997
things

2357.579 --> 2363.7000000000003
in the way they want it to shape it I I

2361.119 --> 2365.859
guess I'm not sure

2363.7 --> 2367.839
um so what somebody said in chat

2365.859 --> 2369.94
actually yeah I haven't followed up on

2367.839 --> 2372.04
that story actually there's some a

2369.94 --> 2374.5
recent bank failure I've seen something

2372.04 --> 2377.2599999999998
pass by about that but yeah there's like

2374.5 --> 2379.42
another bank failure which

2377.26 --> 2381.1600000000003
might cause the Chain Reaction I'm not

2379.42 --> 2383.92
sure I have to follow up on that but

2381.16 --> 2385.7799999999997
there's again something weird you know

2383.92 --> 2387.4
aside from all the other things we're

2385.78 --> 2389.1400000000003
talking about like the chemical spills

2387.4 --> 2391.119
and the wars and now it's the bank

2389.14 --> 2392.859
there's an attack on the financial

2391.119 --> 2394.6600000000003
system as well what they've been talking

2392.859 --> 2396.22
about for a long time you know the

2394.66 --> 2398.7999999999997
global collapse of the current Financial

2396.22 --> 2401.04
system so they can Implement new digital

2398.8 --> 2405.3390000000004
ways of

2401.04 --> 2407.02
money transfer and identity transfer and

2405.339 --> 2409.66
all that jazz so

2407.02 --> 2413.02
yeah what's yeah it's in the third 2030

2409.66 --> 2414.0989999999997
yeah exactly yeah those well yeah it's

2413.02 --> 2416.5
uh

2414.099 --> 2418.54
it's a weird uh

2416.5 --> 2421.359
it's a weird time we're living in it

2418.54 --> 2423.22
yeah it's crazy it's crazy but it's not

2421.359 --> 2425.38
something of just this time it's been

2423.22 --> 2427.0
like this since there's been economics I

2425.38 --> 2428.7400000000002
suppose

2427.0 --> 2431.44
I don't know

2428.74 --> 2434.4599999999996
it all depends on people's standards I

2431.44 --> 2437.98
mean yeah this works that way oh people

2434.46 --> 2441.7
it's like oh yeah people will

2437.98 --> 2443.14
start to like take money for maintenance

2441.7 --> 2448.66
of something

2443.14 --> 2452.0789999999997
if other people allow them to

2448.66 --> 2455.14
it's only about neglect this entire

2452.079 --> 2459.0
issue cascading generation upon

2455.14 --> 2464.0789999999997
generation is only because of neglect

2459.0 --> 2466.839
only the neglect comes forth out of I I

2464.079 --> 2470.26
suppose greed because you want something

2466.839 --> 2472.18
so you neglect to do a certain thing to

2470.26 --> 2473.38
get more of that something that you want

2472.18 --> 2477.2799999999997
to have right

2473.38 --> 2479.859
so I think it's that in my opinion

2477.28 --> 2482.579
that's the main main issue of of of

2479.859 --> 2486.22
human

2482.579 --> 2488.5
nature is that we always want something

2486.22 --> 2490.66
the other doesn't have right they're

2488.5 --> 2493.54
always asked to have that always has to

2490.66 --> 2495.5789999999997
be this imbalance like it wouldn't help

2493.54 --> 2497.079
if you would make everybody Rich if

2495.579 --> 2499.92
everybody would have the same because

2497.079 --> 2503.98
there has to be this difference

2499.92 --> 2507.599
that way but it seems like this is this

2503.98 --> 2510.76
is like hard-coded in our nature to to

2507.599 --> 2513.04
outdo others and to have more than

2510.76 --> 2515.6800000000003
others and and this escalates you know

2513.04 --> 2518.92
as especially as civilizations grow and

2515.68 --> 2520.66
and and and and commodities grow and

2518.92 --> 2522.52
people just want more and more

2520.66 --> 2526.54
especially if you look at the Super Rich

2522.52 --> 2529.48
right there's if you're if you go past a

2526.54 --> 2532.0
certain amount of of making money for

2529.48 --> 2534.46
yourself every month you start having

2532.0 --> 2537.64
these more more and more decadent things

2534.46 --> 2540.94
like a faster car a bigger house more

2537.64 --> 2543.04
wives or more men whatever your thing is

2540.94 --> 2545.14
right and you start getting more extreme

2543.04 --> 2547.96
extreme like the super rich like Super

2545.14 --> 2552.0
Hyper rich I wouldn't be surprised if

2547.96 --> 2555.099
they if they you know do stuff and and

2552.0 --> 2556.839
basically we all know they do stuff

2555.099 --> 2558.94
normal people wouldn't think of because

2556.839 --> 2561.46
that regular thing just doesn't do it

2558.94 --> 2563.38
for him anymore it's a it's a

2561.46 --> 2565.119
progressional thing like it's you get

2563.38 --> 2567.76
used to certain things just like you

2565.119 --> 2571.38
yeah I know I mean money money corrupts

2567.76 --> 2574.119
and then you become like a money demons

2571.38 --> 2577.1800000000003
following your own egos impulse but

2574.119 --> 2580.78
that's is not relevant though it's that

2577.18 --> 2582.819
only works if people allow you to do

2580.78 --> 2585.4
that

2582.819 --> 2587.44
yeah

2585.4 --> 2589.119
yeah if it's like oh oh I could do this

2587.44 --> 2591.94
oh then everybody's like oh yeah please

2589.119 --> 2594.1600000000003
give me your money whatever even if

2591.94 --> 2595.96
you're like literally Satan I don't care

2594.16 --> 2598.359
yeah then they can do whatever the [ __ ]

2595.96 --> 2600.7
they want and it's all gross and

2598.359 --> 2604.18
everybody's letting it happen right so

2600.7 --> 2606.3999999999996
it's all about oh oh you're okay with

2604.18 --> 2608.319
everybody being complete demons as long

2606.4 --> 2610.359
as there's an off chance that you might

2608.319 --> 2613.54
get something out of it on the short run

2610.359 --> 2615.5989999999997
okay well then you deserve hell and

2613.54 --> 2619.3
death

2615.599 --> 2621.76
I'm yeah yeah basically yeah I would say

2619.3 --> 2623.619
so yeah as well

2621.76 --> 2626.5600000000004
yeah sorry probably getting it tense

2623.619 --> 2630.3
this is just these people pissed me off

2626.56 --> 2633.5789999999997
I hate it like I I get I Get Physical

2630.3 --> 2634.96
but it is it is it is super annoying

2633.579 --> 2637.0
because there's so little you can do

2634.96 --> 2639.579
about it right there's no there isn't no

2637.0 --> 2641.68
I think you can set an example you can

2639.579 --> 2643.7200000000003
tell people what to do I've been doing

2641.68 --> 2645.2799999999997
things about it by giving suggestions

2643.72 --> 2647.02
here I see is what you can do oh

2645.28 --> 2649.599
somebody's neglecting [ __ ] everybody's

2647.02 --> 2652.42
gonna die if this continues here's what

2649.599 --> 2654.88
you can do we can do something we can

2652.42 --> 2657.339
have ideas we cannot sit by like oh

2654.88 --> 2659.1400000000003
everything's just going to [ __ ] yeah no

2657.339 --> 2661.72
you can do something you can be creative

2659.14 --> 2664.7799999999997
you can be dynamic you can be adaptive

2661.72 --> 2667.72
and you can be hopeful and basically

2664.78 --> 2671.8590000000004
Force the good spirit that you have and

2667.72 --> 2673.54
apply with its Dynamics onto others

2671.859 --> 2676.359
through example

2673.54 --> 2678.18
you can we can do something but you

2676.359 --> 2680.319
gotta take it seriously

2678.18 --> 2682.8999999999996
there are more and more there are others

2680.319 --> 2686.14
that that are preaching the other way

2682.9 --> 2688.359
right that aren't that are solutions

2686.14 --> 2690.339
that's the nice thing about internet and

2688.359 --> 2691.96
maybe not necessarily YouTube because

2690.339 --> 2694.359
it's become more and more restricting

2691.96 --> 2698.38
but there's other other platforms

2694.359 --> 2700.02
popping up where people are are having

2698.38 --> 2703.0
the chance to

2700.02 --> 2704.74
openly discuss certain things which they

2703.0 --> 2707.2
maybe couldn't on YouTube which is a

2704.74 --> 2709.54
good thing so there's like a counter

2707.2 --> 2711.04
movement to this whole thing it's just a

2709.54 --> 2713.14
matter of

2711.04 --> 2717.7599999999998
if it's enough or not right there's

2713.14 --> 2720.64
large forces that are working at this

2717.76 --> 2723.3390000000004
destruction of uh our current society

2720.64 --> 2725.0789999999997
and it's hard to go against that if

2723.339 --> 2728.98
you're just a regular person you have to

2725.079 --> 2731.079
be many like a lot but luckily there are

2728.98 --> 2733.48
many of us so we all just have to get

2731.079 --> 2735.7000000000003
aligned yeah but look I don't even see

2733.48 --> 2739.359
it look I think that the censorship

2735.7 --> 2742.66
doesn't really matter even to that curve

2739.359 --> 2744.5789999999997
of that growth curve of people racing

2742.66 --> 2747.64
against all this and trying to find an

2744.579 --> 2750.04
alternative right because if I can just

2747.64 --> 2752.74
on the Fly think of a solution of what

2750.04 --> 2754.48
you could do to actually make it stop if

2752.74 --> 2758.14
you could just in a conversation just

2754.48 --> 2759.94
like that some random guy with like what

2758.14 --> 2761.14
is it how many subscribers do I have not

2759.94 --> 2763.839
that much

2761.14 --> 2765.64
like I could come up with that so if one

2763.839 --> 2768.2799999999997
individual can just come up with that in

2765.64 --> 2769.9
the fly then a lot of people can it's

2768.28 --> 2773.5
probably just

2769.9 --> 2774.7000000000003
timidness and fear paranoia that holds

2773.5 --> 2777.7
them back

2774.7 --> 2780.339
right everybody can do that

2777.7 --> 2784.06
it's yeah

2780.339 --> 2786.16
so yeah neglect cover this

2784.06 --> 2789.2799999999997
that's what's that's what's causing all

2786.16 --> 2791.68
this and hey if you just think that oh I

2789.28 --> 2795.3390000000004
realized the threat now let me watch

2791.68 --> 2797.14
like eight hours of fear porn about

2795.339 --> 2799.48
these subjects

2797.14 --> 2801.64
all day long and not do anything else

2799.48 --> 2806.02
you think that's gonna solve it

2801.64 --> 2808.66
no it isn't no right for example like I

2806.02 --> 2811.96
watch Alex Jones I still do but

2808.66 --> 2815.74
sometimes he is just on about such

2811.96 --> 2816.819
paranoid horse [ __ ] he overextends some

2815.74 --> 2819.7
concept

2816.819 --> 2823.54
and he basically grants the elite

2819.7 --> 2825.04
ultimate power every time like oh they

2823.54 --> 2828.46
could do this and that and that and then

2825.04 --> 2831.16
the AI will be like he just attributes

2828.46 --> 2833.92
every extremity of power to these

2831.16 --> 2836.2
individuals that he opposes

2833.92 --> 2838.1800000000003
and that makes people [ __ ] because

2836.2 --> 2840.5789999999997
they all become paranoid and they all

2838.18 --> 2843.52
ascribe supreme power to these people

2840.579 --> 2845.8
doing these things because of him it's a

2843.52 --> 2848.38
shame that he was so extreme with this

2845.8 --> 2850.96
with his uh the way he expressed himself

2848.38 --> 2853.06
and and even over the top the thing with

2850.96 --> 2854.68
the stupid thing is that he did have a

2853.06 --> 2856.839
couple of good points obviously a couple

2854.68 --> 2859.96
we had a lot of good points but then he

2856.839 --> 2862.66
starts blabbermouthing getting creative

2859.96 --> 2865.7200000000003
with his paranoid idiocy and then

2862.66 --> 2867.5789999999997
ascribing ultimate power to the elite he

2865.72 --> 2869.2599999999998
does it every time then he talks like oh

2867.579 --> 2871.42
but no they're really stupid they don't

2869.26 --> 2873.2200000000003
know what they're doing but then like

2871.42 --> 2874.9
five minutes later you talk how they are

2873.22 --> 2877.24
but they have the power over this and

2874.9 --> 2879.88
then and it will take control the demon

2877.24 --> 2883.7799999999997
has all the power and like dude you are

2879.88 --> 2885.94
freaking hysterical idiot yeah yeah they

2883.78 --> 2888.2200000000003
get they they like stick to the facts

2885.94 --> 2890.339
stick to the facts and shut the [ __ ] up

2888.22 --> 2893.0789999999997
about your paranoid speculation

2890.339 --> 2894.339
retardation it's just driving people

2893.079 --> 2896.079
insane

2894.339 --> 2897.88
they're losing track they'd over

2896.079 --> 2899.8590000000004
generalize all your followers are just

2897.88 --> 2901.9
going to over generalize everything like

2899.859 --> 2904.5989999999997
complete retards they're not even gonna

2901.9 --> 2907.0
pay attention anymore what anybody says

2904.599 --> 2909.76
because they're just gonna be paranoid

2907.0 --> 2911.98
and not listening anymore that's what

2909.76 --> 2914.3190000000004
happens when you do that

2911.98 --> 2916.72
with your audience it's true it's a

2914.319 --> 2918.099
shame that that he he went so well with

2916.72 --> 2919.72
the top but there's other people taking

2918.099 --> 2921.76
over framework there's a couple of

2919.72 --> 2924.5789999999997
people that have been I think I've been

2921.76 --> 2925.9
friends it's true right uh there's this

2924.579 --> 2928.2400000000002
channel called

2925.9 --> 2930.4
um redacted I don't know maybe a couple

2928.24 --> 2932.9199999999996
of you know this I've heard the name but

2930.4 --> 2934.54
I don't watch it oh yeah last time I

2932.92 --> 2936.52
find it interesting because it it does

2934.54 --> 2939.22
follow the current developments of of

2936.52 --> 2940.9
stuff that means she maybe wouldn't show

2939.22 --> 2942.3999999999996
on the news so as you know I take

2940.9 --> 2944.26
everything with a grain of salt nowadays

2942.4 --> 2946.119
because you never know anything which

2944.26 --> 2948.1600000000003
you see on a television screen for you

2946.119 --> 2949.48
can you cannot trust anything anymore so

2948.16 --> 2951.04
I take everything with a great install

2949.48 --> 2954.46
it's just nice to hear all the different

2951.04 --> 2956.38
sides right so you know the following

2954.46 --> 2959.079
guy I'm gonna tell you is some will say

2956.38 --> 2960.579
he's a an absolute idiot some will you

2959.079 --> 2962.26
know think he's right in what he's

2960.579 --> 2964.9
saying but I've been following Russell

2962.26 --> 2967.119
Brand lately yeah as well he's been

2964.9 --> 2968.8
saying you know a couple of shows I've

2967.119 --> 2970.599
I've been listening he had interviews

2968.8 --> 2972.52
where he's not that flamboyant it was a

2970.599 --> 2974.02
little bit more toned down but a couple

2972.52 --> 2976.2
of interviews he has done with a couple

2974.02 --> 2978.52
of people that you know there's

2976.2 --> 2980.46
interesting stuff coming out of it which

2978.52 --> 2984.22
makes you think like well sometimes yeah

2980.46 --> 2986.14
but he's not he's not very spectacular

2984.22 --> 2988.66
but yeah I've seen Russell Brandt come

2986.14 --> 2991.18
by here and there it's not so much him

2988.66 --> 2994.24
it's more the people he invites and then

2991.18 --> 2996.339
the conversations that flow out of that

2994.24 --> 2999.22
you know interaction all right it's the

2996.339 --> 3002.819
the Standalone shows it's it's uh very

2999.22 --> 3005.0989999999997
uh you know it's always his demeanor is

3002.819 --> 3007.02
so spectacular it's a little bit too

3005.099 --> 3008.7000000000003
much for me it's not something that I I

3007.02 --> 3010.619
enjoy watching for too long but when

3008.7 --> 3013.859
he's more toned down and once more back

3010.619 --> 3015.48
and forth of of of people exchanging uh

3013.859 --> 3018.42
information or stuff that they know or

3015.48 --> 3020.339
their Visions there's there's a couple

3018.42 --> 3022.859
that are very interesting which which

3020.339 --> 3025.0789999999997
hold a lot of Truth in them I suppose

3022.859 --> 3026.64
which uh which you wouldn't hear in

3025.079 --> 3029.04
other places and it's the same with the

3026.64 --> 3030.72
redacted as well like I think the guys

3029.04 --> 3032.46
from redacted came with that Seymour

3030.72 --> 3034.7999999999997
Hersh story

3032.46 --> 3038.339
first or they were one of the first

3034.8 --> 3040.7400000000002
about the Nordstrom and and you know

3038.339 --> 3044.22
basically Biden uh ordering it to be

3040.74 --> 3045.839
blown up not not sure so you know

3044.22 --> 3048.359
obviously I'm heavily inclined to

3045.839 --> 3051.42
believe that version of of the truth

3048.359 --> 3054.18
than the others because well it's just

3051.42 --> 3055.98
obvious come on yeah but uh yeah there's

3054.18 --> 3057.8999999999996
like that and that's what I was trying

3055.98 --> 3060.78
to say as well I mean you got to be a

3057.9 --> 3063.1800000000003
complete conspiracy Nutter to believe

3060.78 --> 3065.7000000000003
what the mainstream actually tells you

3063.18 --> 3068.0989999999997
really happens at this point yeah it's

3065.7 --> 3070.2
completely remember in the 90s aha

3068.099 --> 3072.9
cookie conspiracy theories look at how

3070.2 --> 3075.18
silly they are with silly ideas now that

3072.9 --> 3078.96
the the mainstream narratives have now

3075.18 --> 3081.5989999999997
become that level of silly you gotta be

3078.96 --> 3084.66
a Nutty conspiracy theorist to actually

3081.599 --> 3087.599
believe what they tell you now in the

3084.66 --> 3089.64
mainstream okay we've arrived there it's

3087.599 --> 3091.6800000000003
that bad it's the other way around

3089.64 --> 3093.24
you're not nutty conspiracy theorist not

3091.68 --> 3096.02
to believe you're not conspiracy

3093.24 --> 3098.52
theories if you believe their [ __ ]

3096.02 --> 3101.339
that's real

3098.52 --> 3103.619
unfortunately yeah

3101.339 --> 3105.9
yeah that's a shame so I I don't even

3103.619 --> 3107.88
know what they talk about on the I like

3105.9 --> 3110.099
at last time I've watched like news

3107.88 --> 3113.28
Dutch news is

3110.099 --> 3115.619
probably like six years ago

3113.28 --> 3118.079
I don't even go there anymore to check

3115.619 --> 3120.3
or to double check anything it's just

3118.079 --> 3123.54
everything it's so garbage that comes

3120.3 --> 3126.9
out of there I can't can't listen to

3123.54 --> 3128.7
that for like longer than a few seconds

3126.9 --> 3131.819
no well yeah

3128.7 --> 3134.9399999999996
I I listen to I listen to I watch it

3131.819 --> 3136.7
sometimes not very much but there's a

3134.94 --> 3138.78
lot of parts that I skip actually

3136.7 --> 3141.24
there's a lot of points where I think

3138.78 --> 3144.119
okay especially when our prime minister

3141.24 --> 3146.4799999999996
is coming up oh yeah I just skipped that

3144.119 --> 3149.819
bit because

3146.48 --> 3153.54
the way he speaks just annoys the living

3149.819 --> 3155.04
[ __ ] out of me I can't take his uh it's

3153.54 --> 3158.22
just never a straight answer with this

3155.04 --> 3160.68
guy like I've never heard him give even

3158.22 --> 3163.6189999999997
if it's a simple question it's just so

3160.68 --> 3165.2999999999997
baked in his in his way of thought like

3163.619 --> 3168.059
even if you ask him a simple question

3165.3 --> 3170.04
like did you just go to the toilet for

3168.059 --> 3172.1400000000003
example you'll get an over elaborate

3170.04 --> 3173.94
answer that doesn't answer the question

3172.14 --> 3176.4
yes he speaks a lot of different things

3173.94 --> 3178.619
except where he says yeah I went to the

3176.4 --> 3181.02
toilet like you know he's a systematic

3178.619 --> 3183.96
straw manner you just go you can't help

3181.02 --> 3185.88
it he's compulsive straw Manning yeah he

3183.96 --> 3188.16
does it with everything

3185.88 --> 3190.559
you're right that's the same so it's

3188.16 --> 3193.6189999999997
like the guy that never answers a

3190.559 --> 3195.5400000000004
question straight no never ever no but

3193.619 --> 3198.2400000000002
it's it's a description it's his

3195.54 --> 3200.88
personal bureaucracy I mean that does

3198.24 --> 3202.74
definitely keep people away from him

3200.88 --> 3204.48
because everybody knows you're never

3202.74 --> 3206.22
gonna get a straight answer so it's

3204.48 --> 3207.72
going to be really strenuous to get

3206.22 --> 3209.8799999999997
anything out of him that's useful

3207.72 --> 3213.6189999999997
because he always straw mans everything

3209.88 --> 3213.619
yeah it's a tactic

3213.8 --> 3219.96
he lives for politics yeah he doesn't do

3218.099 --> 3221.94
anything he doesn't have a life outside

3219.96 --> 3223.98
of politics he doesn't have a family he

3221.94 --> 3226.2000000000003
doesn't have a partner he's been in

3223.98 --> 3228.66
politics since he was like 16 years old

3226.2 --> 3230.5789999999997
no he's into it so so that's his whole

3228.66 --> 3231.66
that's his whole thing that's his gem

3230.579 --> 3232.98
that's his thing he doesn't know

3231.66 --> 3234.72
anything else that's why he wants to

3232.98 --> 3236.18
stay in it because he knows that if he

3234.72 --> 3240.1189999999997
goes out

3236.18 --> 3242.0989999999997
nothing much he could do I get it but I

3240.119 --> 3243.96
know you know I would have actually

3242.099 --> 3247.02
thought it was pretty cool I would like

3243.96 --> 3250.859
to have him there if he wouldn't be a

3247.02 --> 3253.559
freaking Nazi supporter literally like

3250.859 --> 3257.22
if he just wouldn't do this [ __ ] up

3253.559 --> 3260.52
eugenic [ __ ] and go along with all that

3257.22 --> 3262.2599999999998
then I'd be like awesome that's the

3260.52 --> 3266.099
politician I hope he like stays in

3262.26 --> 3269.099
Parliament forever but he is corrupt

3266.099 --> 3271.6800000000003
he is on the wrong side and then it

3269.099 --> 3274.2000000000003
sucks he just sucks

3271.68 --> 3275.64
if you could just stop doing that but he

3274.2 --> 3277.0789999999997
probably can't he's probably weighing

3275.64 --> 3279.0
over his head I don't know what the hell

3277.079 --> 3282.119
he's been up to I've always been

3279.0 --> 3284.76
blackmail but a while back somebody

3282.119 --> 3288.1800000000003
dug up this uh old news article like

3284.76 --> 3292.2000000000003
like a a cutout of a news article and

3288.18 --> 3295.0789999999997
you saw him as a 16 year old in I think

3292.2 --> 3297.7799999999997
it was even the youth party of the FIFA

3295.079 --> 3300.0
day or the Fifi D where he was

3297.78 --> 3301.1600000000003
advocating

3300.0 --> 3304.319
um

3301.16 --> 3306.48
what this you know the the political

3304.319 --> 3308.04
party Martine what they are advocating

3306.48 --> 3309.54
I'm not going to say but what they are

3308.04 --> 3312.599
advocating that was what he was

3309.54 --> 3315.48
advocating for the FIFA day back in the

3312.599 --> 3317.46
days I don't know that part can you

3315.48 --> 3319.68
give her up you know the political party

3317.46 --> 3322.5
more time no

3319.68 --> 3324.8999999999996
you don't want to know it so but okay is

3322.5 --> 3326.339
it like racist or what what is it what's

3324.9 --> 3328.859
terrible about it

3326.339 --> 3331.44
it's it's a group of men that advocate

3328.859 --> 3333.48
for the possibility of of a certain

3331.44 --> 3337.5
intercourse with people of a certain age

3333.48 --> 3341.16
yeah yeah so he was Jesus Christ

3337.5 --> 3344.66
advocating a a more freedom for these

3341.16 --> 3348.2999999999997
people back in the day so this is right

3344.66 --> 3350.339
look that up against him so thanks well

3348.3 --> 3353.1600000000003
yeah you ruined that for me then God

3350.339 --> 3355.5
damn it Mark that piece of [ __ ] so

3353.16 --> 3357.359
careful with my wording I didn't want to

3355.5 --> 3359.339
be too explicit but I didn't want to

3357.359 --> 3362.52
bring over that point right that he's

3359.339 --> 3365.22
you know one of those idiots so [ __ ]

3362.52 --> 3368.88
hell you know from the start I had like

3365.22 --> 3372.66
this guy is [ __ ] not not well

3368.88 --> 3375.6600000000003
ugh I I didn't even know that although I

3372.66 --> 3378.96
I really wanted though to be fair like

3375.66 --> 3381.7799999999997
does he even care or is it just because

3378.96 --> 3384.599
he thinks it's about power I mean I'd

3381.78 --> 3386.52
see him do anything whatever he thought

3384.599 --> 3389.46
would give power like he would literally

3386.52 --> 3391.079
slay a human being on camera if he

3389.46 --> 3392.52
thought it would give him some kind of

3391.079 --> 3394.52
political favor

3392.52 --> 3394.52
um

3395.059 --> 3401.8190000000004
hold on is he literally into that or did

3399.059 --> 3404.059
he just want to protect some powerful

3401.819 --> 3406.14
person to get more power

3404.059 --> 3408.7200000000003
what do you think I think the article

3406.14 --> 3411.18
said is that what from what I what I

3408.72 --> 3413.819
remember is that the youth party of this

3411.18 --> 3417.24
certain particular uh this uh particular

3413.819 --> 3420.54
uh political party was advocating for

3417.24 --> 3423.7799999999997
more freedom of these groups of people

3420.54 --> 3427.2599999999998
not that he himself was into he was just

3423.78 --> 3430.8
advocating for a less harsh position

3427.26 --> 3433.92
against these types of people okay

3430.8 --> 3436.6800000000003
and uh obviously you know

3433.92 --> 3439.6800000000003
is being linked to his personal

3436.68 --> 3442.2599999999998
preferences which I don't know I don't

3439.68 --> 3445.3799999999997
know I think he's just into into women

3442.26 --> 3447.42
really I have no I I think he's like

3445.38 --> 3449.94
this one of these typical asexual guys

3447.42 --> 3452.04
who doesn't even need it right he

3449.94 --> 3454.02
doesn't seem super excited yeah I think

3452.04 --> 3457.74
he does sometimes but it's just like

3454.02 --> 3460.74
he's not really a pervert it doesn't

3457.74 --> 3462.359
seem like he he care about that that it

3460.74 --> 3465.8999999999996
could do it and it would do anything for

3462.359 --> 3467.64
me he's not like a little a really gross

3465.9 --> 3469.7000000000003
creepy he doesn't have that and he's

3467.64 --> 3473.16
like pretty

3469.7 --> 3475.7999999999997
autistic about just his one way of doing

3473.16 --> 3478.74
things with everything he's just not

3475.8 --> 3480.6600000000003
into that I think but if he did that for

3478.74 --> 3482.8799999999997
power I get it he might also have been

3480.66 --> 3486.2999999999997
just really naive I mean

3482.88 --> 3488.7000000000003
when I was like a younger teenager I was

3486.3 --> 3491.46
really hold on let me finish

3488.7 --> 3493.319
when I was a younger teenager I was also

3491.46 --> 3495.48
very naive about it and I thought like

3493.319 --> 3498.119
yeah but what did what's so wrong about

3495.48 --> 3499.44
if you fall in love with somebody that I

3498.119 --> 3502.079
didn't understand anything I didn't

3499.44 --> 3504.119
understand how [ __ ] up it was so I

3502.079 --> 3505.44
might have been caught somewhere saying

3504.119 --> 3509.76
that too

3505.44 --> 3511.7400000000002
so it could be that or he knew how

3509.76 --> 3513.3
[ __ ] up it was and he's just doing it

3511.74 --> 3516.0589999999997
for power because I don't think he's

3513.3 --> 3517.559
actually like you know well there's a

3516.059 --> 3518.94
difference when you're when you're when

3517.559 --> 3520.44
you're a child and you just say

3518.94 --> 3522.48
something like that when you're in a

3520.44 --> 3524.94
social encounter or just like a casual

3522.48 --> 3527.099
encounter as opposed to when you are 16

3524.94 --> 3530.2200000000003
or 17 year old and you're in front of a

3527.099 --> 3533.1600000000003
committee with a microphone

3530.22 --> 3535.3799999999997
advocating for a political party and

3533.16 --> 3537.1189999999997
certain rights of other people that's

3535.38 --> 3539.339
not really the same thing like you're

3537.119 --> 3541.6800000000003
actually advocating when you're just a

3539.339 --> 3545.099
child like obviously kids nowadays they

3541.68 --> 3547.6189999999997
go through phases yeah I get it so you

3545.099 --> 3549.3590000000004
can you couldn't really count anybody on

3547.619 --> 3551.099
on what they said as a child but when

3549.359 --> 3553.68
you're like when you're like a young

3551.099 --> 3556.38
adult I would say and you're you're

3553.68 --> 3559.5
you're consciously partaking in in a

3556.38 --> 3562.559
debate about political stuff concerning

3559.5 --> 3564.54
groups of people and their freedoms yeah

3562.559 --> 3566.2200000000003
it carries a lot more weight in my

3564.54 --> 3569.579
opinion I would say

3566.22 --> 3571.5589999999997
all right but I was at the time also I

3569.579 --> 3573.7200000000003
thought like no no those people need

3571.559 --> 3576.3590000000004
defending that's what I thought back

3573.72 --> 3578.7
then so but I I wouldn't like get on

3576.359 --> 3581.94
camera it was like way too scared to to

3578.7 --> 3584.7599999999998
put myself down even in general like in

3581.94 --> 3586.38
front of a camera or an audience so I

3584.76 --> 3589.2000000000003
would have never done that but I mean

3586.38 --> 3591.059
back at the the day I did have in my

3589.2 --> 3593.2799999999997
mindset I was like no it's just

3591.059 --> 3597.3590000000004
misunderstood I was I was really

3593.28 --> 3599.0400000000004
honestly like that and because I I kind

3597.359 --> 3600.7799999999997
of I just thought like these people are

3599.04 --> 3603.839
just constantly getting slandered like

3600.78 --> 3606.5400000000004
they're monsters I didn't understand how

3603.839 --> 3609.9
messed up it really is and how I've

3606.54 --> 3612.7799999999997
never I had never seen a person

3609.9 --> 3616.38
doing that based acting

3612.78 --> 3619.92
evil against like seeing that a demon

3616.38 --> 3622.559
comes out I did not understand that at

3619.92 --> 3624.7200000000003
all I just was really kind of from a

3622.559 --> 3626.94
childish perspective for a very long

3624.72 --> 3628.799
time so I was like oh no they just they

3626.94 --> 3631.2200000000003
just fall in love with children I mean

3628.799 --> 3633.9
yeah that would be pretty tough you know

3631.22 --> 3637.14
I get it I just

3633.9 --> 3640.14
but then much later I learned like how

3637.14 --> 3642.5989999999997
freaking insane some people let it grow

3640.14 --> 3645.18
and that there's just torture and [ __ ]

3642.599 --> 3646.98
happening also I which I refuse to

3645.18 --> 3649.2599999999998
believe

3646.98 --> 3652.92
yeah well you know until it was

3649.26 --> 3654.78
literally shown to me yeah yeah well you

3652.92 --> 3656.4
get older eventually get wiser and

3654.78 --> 3659.94
things things change your perceptions

3656.4 --> 3663.1800000000003
change eventually so you know it's not

3659.94 --> 3664.68
you can't really fault yourself for

3663.18 --> 3666.0
thinking a certain way when you're a kid

3664.68 --> 3668.2799999999997
because you're still developing right

3666.0 --> 3670.02
things change right so your your views

3668.28 --> 3672.119
change your perceptions changed mine

3670.02 --> 3674.7
have changed over time as well so it's

3672.119 --> 3676.44
just a natural thing but I'm I'm looking

yeah what do you think about what I was

3949.98 --> 3954.66
talking about today

3952.44 --> 3956.52
I didn't really read as I was talking

3954.66 --> 3958.819
about I mean I was just focused on

3956.52 --> 3958.819
status

3993.599 --> 3997.52
what are you guys talking about

3998.039 --> 4001.119
Richard G

4017.18 --> 4019.4199999999996
foreign

4042.2 --> 4048.02
all right all right fine I guess

4046.579 --> 4050.2000000000003
anyway I hope you guys have been

4048.02 --> 4053.059
enjoying this show special episode with

4050.2 --> 4054.74
desperatz if you do then don't forget

4053.059 --> 4057.3190000000004
the rogans up

4054.74 --> 4061.0989999999997
right now

4057.319 --> 4063.52
don't wait until you forget at the end

4061.099 --> 4063.52
of the show

4066.44 --> 4070.88
I got three votes man come on

4069.079 --> 4073.2200000000003
come on guys

4070.88 --> 4074.96
chat is full you didn't like you didn't

4073.22 --> 4077.6189999999997
like the show

4074.96 --> 4077.619
come on

4084.02 --> 4089.48
cool guys yeah me too now I'm gonna have

4086.599 --> 4091.94
him more on I mean I really like the guy

4089.48 --> 4094.88
these are good conversations and we are

4091.94 --> 4098.14
fluent we're pretty fluid together I

4094.88 --> 4101.179
mean sometimes he gets a bit like

4098.14 --> 4102.92
awkward timing and responding like

4101.179 --> 4105.56
talking

4102.92 --> 4107.719
pretty much straight over me

4105.56 --> 4111.56
and but I mean

4107.719 --> 4113.779
he's not really used to being live in a

4111.56 --> 4117.319
conversation I think overall he does

4113.779 --> 4120.02
great and and we really do connect

4117.319 --> 4121.900000000001
when we're talking about things so yeah

4120.02 --> 4125.120000000001
it's been interesting

4121.9 --> 4127.219
definitely we can do this many times

4125.12 --> 4129.5599999999995
again I think

4127.219 --> 4132.699
the dynamic was different different from

4129.56 --> 4132.6990000000005
what Clary

4135.88 --> 4141.08
from me yelling at the chat why aren't

4138.98 --> 4142.879999999999
you saying anything for 12 minutes trade

4141.08 --> 4145.7789999999995
yeah it's different it's definitely a

4142.88 --> 4145.779
different dynamic

4147.46 --> 4153.14
you do speak over stairs as well yeah

4150.799 --> 4157.0
but I mean I don't

4153.14 --> 4157.0
like not when he's like really

4157.16 --> 4161.3189999999995
still in the middle of making a point

4162.02 --> 4167.679
maybe I did it a couple of times but

4163.94 --> 4167.678999999999
then I discontinued I mean it happens

4168.739 --> 4172.339
right

4169.88 --> 4174.9400000000005
I do it to a little I guess what are you

4172.339 --> 4174.94
not supposed to

4175.16 --> 4180.0199999999995
but also I didn't mean sometimes he just

4177.679 --> 4182.719
kind of like wanted to roll a little bit

4180.02 --> 4183.9800000000005
too much into details that aren't super

4182.719 --> 4187.2390000000005
interesting

4183.98 --> 4187.239
but I mean yeah

4187.699 --> 4192.4
I think there's much potential overall

4215.8 --> 4222.04
I am really hungry though

4219.56 --> 4222.04
yeah

4222.14 --> 4227.08
I was already kind of hungry when it

4224.3 --> 4227.08
started to show

4244.34 --> 4246.88
foreign

4247.96 --> 4255.02
that I got the interface right that we

4251.179 --> 4257.4400000000005
just could be on camera at the same time

4255.02 --> 4260.540000000001
and figured out how to restart my camera

4257.44 --> 4261.98
so I I can't just do this now

4260.54 --> 4266.199
much better

4261.98 --> 4266.199
also with other people over Skype

4287.54 --> 4292.04
oh yeah sorry Casey yeah but I mean

4290.12 --> 4294.5599999999995
nobody's gonna start a dumpster fire on

4292.04 --> 4299.36
my show when they're on with me as a

4294.56 --> 4301.46
guest because I'd freaking kick him out

4299.36 --> 4306.139999999999
but yeah I hate it when people do that

4301.46 --> 4308.2390000000005
but that's effectively called rumpusing

4306.14 --> 4311.12
it's like when you just

4308.239 --> 4314.0
over talk somebody because specifically

4311.12 --> 4315.38
you don't want them to be heard or you

4314.0 --> 4317.739
don't want to hear them in what they're

4315.38 --> 4317.7390000000005
saying

4317.84 --> 4322.06
yeah it's very annoying when that

4319.88 --> 4322.06
happens

4338.44 --> 4341.86
right anyway

4349.719 --> 4358.28
yeah the contrast weapon is a bit big

4353.3 --> 4360.62
now not really fluidly talking anymore

4358.28 --> 4364.04
I mean we didn't we effectively didn't

4360.62 --> 4366.739
shop shut up for an hour straight

4364.04 --> 4368.78
not a second

4366.739 --> 4371.5599999999995
that's the advantage of having somebody

4368.78 --> 4371.5599999999995
on with you

4387.86 --> 4390.46
thank you

4392.32 --> 4397.34
foreign

4394.96 --> 4399.92
yeah I've heard of that book little

4397.34 --> 4402.64
build Evolution but I mean

4399.92 --> 4402.64
uh

4403.659 --> 4410.379999999999
I wasn't even born when it happened so

4407.06 --> 4410.38
it's not my thing

4438.98 --> 4441.4
oh

4457.84 --> 4463.659000000001
no I'm not gonna eat the bugs Richard G

thanks

4464.9 --> 4468.04

4497.87 --> 4500.96
[Music]

4506.36 --> 4509.239
oh yeah by the way there will be ball

4508.04 --> 4511.58
busters

4509.239 --> 4513.98

4511.58 --> 4516.82
over at Quantum eraser Channel and I

4513.98 --> 4516.82
will also be there

4522.86 --> 4526.299999999999
I don't know what they're gonna talk

4524.0 --> 4526.3
about

4528.92 --> 4533.96
or gas pressure okay

4531.8 --> 4535.659000000001
it's gonna be about gas pressure all

4533.96 --> 4539.08
right

4535.659 --> 4539.08
good see you

4541.44 --> 4544.57
[Music]

4566.04 --> 4569.229
[Music]

4576.5 --> 4582.5
ah Bluefield I wouldn't say that

4579.679 --> 4585.1990000000005
it started people down the path of this

4582.5 --> 4588.28
missing conspiracies

4585.199 --> 4592.239
it just popularized it it was like

4588.28 --> 4592.239
numpty popularization

4594.62 --> 4600.44
right I mean people but before that time

4597.98 --> 4603.259999999999
also dismissed conspiracy theories yeah

4600.44 --> 4605.239
they did they didn't need to be told to

4603.26 --> 4607.34
do that by the government to do that

4605.239 --> 4609.139999999999
okay people dismissed conspiracy

4607.34 --> 4612.38
theories all by themselves

4609.14 --> 4615.64
it's just that when the CIA started to

4612.38 --> 4620.7390000000005
plant all that [ __ ] it just got popular

4615.64 --> 4620.7390000000005
among numpties that's the difference

4661.9 --> 4665.9
what okay

4687.38 --> 4690.38
foreign

4696.1 --> 4702.38
they're not in my food I don't pick food

4699.38 --> 4706.219
that might have bugs in them

4702.38 --> 4708.4400000000005
and I read the ingredients on products

4706.219 --> 4710.12
that I like to eat

4708.44 --> 4711.5
especially when I'm gonna try something

4710.12 --> 4714.679
new

4711.5 --> 4717.56
and I ask if there's something that I

4714.679 --> 4719.0
don't recognize that's in the list

4717.56 --> 4723.320000000001
yeah

4719.0 --> 4725.98
that way I don't eat the bugs without

4723.32 --> 4725.98
knowing it

4738.38 --> 4744.1990000000005
besides I think that's it's not being

4740.84 --> 4745.9400000000005
played even like that really it they

4744.199 --> 4749.678999999999
mostly just want it to be like a

4745.94 --> 4749.678999999999
snobbish thing or whatever they

4752.0 --> 4756.98
I mean they're not aiming like eating

4754.52 --> 4759.860000000001
bugs as like oh this is the alternative

4756.98 --> 4763.159
poor people food no they're rolling out

4759.86 --> 4765.259999999999
trendies they have been for a while to

4763.159 --> 4767.599999999999
make it seem like it's all Posh and

4765.26 --> 4770.54
luxurious that you're really classy for

4767.6 --> 4774.08
doing it that's what they're trying

4770.54 --> 4777.92
so I wonder sometimes are they just

4774.08 --> 4780.62
switching to eating bugs themselves

4777.92 --> 4782.9
or attempting to do that

4780.62 --> 4785.679
some kind of virtual signal there's

4782.9 --> 4785.679
Satan or whatever

4787.52 --> 4792.56
because it's not like oh oh yeah we you

4790.4 --> 4795.08
know those regular supermarkets with the

4792.56 --> 4796.88
cheap ass food everywhere oh well they

4795.08 --> 4800.0
certainly don't have that cheap ass food

4796.88 --> 4801.4400000000005
anymore they just have bugs now

4800.0 --> 4802.94
uh

4801.44 --> 4805.4
no

4802.94 --> 4809.12
that's not happening and if they would

4805.4 --> 4813.08
try that people would literally Riot and

4809.12 --> 4815.599999999999
burn down buildings if they sell if poor

4813.08 --> 4817.82
people were suddenly forced to eat bugs

4815.6 --> 4820.04
you know what they're gonna do they're

4817.82 --> 4821.239
gonna [ __ ] everything up that's what

4820.04 --> 4823.5199999999995
they're gonna do with it because that's

4821.239 --> 4827.0199999999995
what I would do yeah nobody's gonna

4823.52 --> 4827.02
force me to eat [ __ ] bugs

4827.6 --> 4832.6990000000005
so it really seems more like aim this

4830.12 --> 4833.86
like oh oh you're sure you're all

4832.699 --> 4837.62
climate

4833.86 --> 4841.5199999999995
climate plus and

4837.62 --> 4846.219
all passion modern and so it's the Box

4841.52 --> 4846.219
in your fine expensive clothing

4848.12 --> 4855.88
because I'm not seeing cheap as bug food

4851.42 --> 4855.88
it's not out there not here anyway

4861.64 --> 4867.679
fake virtue signals

4864.679 --> 4870.4400000000005
yeah but is there anything else

4867.679 --> 4873.32
I mean Richard G tell me about this

4870.44 --> 4876.44
region somewhere or a village where

4873.32 --> 4879.44
suddenly the supermarkets don't have

4876.44 --> 4881.299999999999
regular food products they they have now

4879.44 --> 4883.759999999999
the the Box

4881.3 --> 4886.1
right that isn't like some weird

4883.76 --> 4888.14
specialist stores for people that I

4886.1 --> 4890.719
don't know like eating bugs I mean some

4888.14 --> 4893.84
Asian people probably or whatever right

4890.719 --> 4896.6
I mean some Toko you might be able to

4893.84 --> 4898.58
find the bugs really

4896.6 --> 4901.04
they might have bugs they might have

4898.58 --> 4904.159
always had that it's just that this is

4901.04 --> 4906.1
an Asian thing or whatever right

4904.159 --> 4909.739
I'm not seeing it in a regular

4906.1 --> 4911.06
supermarkets I'm not seeing it not

4909.739 --> 4912.379999999999
one

4911.06 --> 4916.0
nothing

4912.38 --> 4916.0
it's no bug aisle

4917.78 --> 4922.04
or maybe I didn't walk into the right

4919.64 --> 4923.42
Supermarket or whatever or the wrong one

4922.04 --> 4925.58
in that case

4923.42 --> 4928.58
but yeah I mean with my Supermarket

4925.58 --> 4929.6
there's nothing not a single sign of

4928.58 --> 4932.42
bugs

4929.6 --> 4935.54
and in the regular supermarkets

4932.42 --> 4939.76
like Albert hang more General bigger

4935.54 --> 4939.76
chain don't see bugs

4941.239 --> 4948.459999999999
drinks has books

4944.84 --> 4948.46
I don't know what grits is

4948.62 --> 4951.699
never heard of that

4966.44 --> 4969.44
right

4970.82 --> 4977.08
so

4972.28 --> 4977.08
it's mostly Fair porn and Bluff

4977.3 --> 4982.219
yeah

4978.44 --> 4985.12
it's a box was probably a very big

4982.219 --> 4987.5
operation just to make

4985.12 --> 4990.62
anti-new World Order

4987.5 --> 4993.98
mean that it was it wasn't offensive it

4990.62 --> 4997.46
was like a hostile meme it's a box look

4993.98 --> 5000.159
look out there everybody [ __ ] says

4997.46 --> 5003.04
that now beats the box every [ __ ]

5000.159 --> 5007.54
body says that now yeah that's called a

5003.04 --> 5009.82
hostile meme a meme that they put out so

5007.54 --> 5011.14
that you are talking about it all the

5009.82 --> 5013.54
time

5011.14 --> 5015.58
right is it being implemented are you

5013.54 --> 5017.98
eating some bugs right now

5015.58 --> 5020.44
no

5017.98 --> 5024.639999999999
you're gonna have to actually go out and

5020.44 --> 5026.86
look for the bugs to be eaten

5024.64 --> 5028.96
in some kind of store because they're

5026.86 --> 5031.96
not anywhere not anywhere that I can

5028.96 --> 5034.54
find maybe some Toco or whatever but

5031.96 --> 5037.84
they've always been there right there's

5034.54 --> 5039.159
no bucks it's all mean it's all getting

5037.84 --> 5040.659000000001
in your head

5039.159 --> 5044.08
Fairborn

5040.659 --> 5046.78
be afraid see them as all-powerful that

5044.08 --> 5048.28
they can't just do all that that you

5046.78 --> 5049.599999999999
believe that they can do all that

5048.28 --> 5051.34
because then they could probably get

5049.6 --> 5052.54
away with more you see if you just

5051.34 --> 5054.159000000001
believe that they could do all that

5052.54 --> 5055.12
nonsense they would say aren't really

5054.159 --> 5057.159
doing

5055.12 --> 5059.5199999999995
because we're not being forced to eat

5057.159 --> 5059.5199999999995
bugs

5060.1 --> 5062.820000000001
not really

5063.04 --> 5069.159
but everybody knows the meme

5066.4 --> 5071.259999999999
eat the bugs everybody's talking about

5069.159 --> 5073.719
everybody's oh you won't eat the bugs

5071.26 --> 5076.6
like where where can I eat those bugs I

5073.719 --> 5079.06
don't know any bugs that I can eat right

5076.6 --> 5081.280000000001
now not that I would want to but I

5079.06 --> 5084.46
haven't seen any

5081.28 --> 5086.32
sounds like a big Meme and a big Bluff

5084.46 --> 5089.44
to me

5086.32 --> 5090.88
that if you just roll over and let them

5089.44 --> 5093.5199999999995
do whatever they want then yeah

5090.88 --> 5094.96
eventually they will just force you to

5093.52 --> 5096.820000000001
eat bugs

5094.96 --> 5099.0
what I mean is that gonna happen right

5096.82 --> 5099.0
now

5099.34 --> 5102.3
I don't think so

5103.0 --> 5112.32
right so as far as I'm concerned eat the

5107.38 --> 5112.32
bugs is nothing but a rumor

5112.36 --> 5116.86
because I'm not eating any books and I

5114.46 --> 5119.04
don't see where you can eat bugs right

5116.86 --> 5119.04
now

5120.1 --> 5128.08
I've seen some celebrities eat bugs in

5123.28 --> 5130.84
promos that's it that's all I've seen

5128.08 --> 5132.5199999999995
and yeah if you tune in some Asian

5130.84 --> 5134.5
Channel you might see them eating some

5132.52 --> 5135.76
weird thing or bugs or whatever I don't

5134.5 --> 5139.96
know

5135.76 --> 5142.320000000001
but in the Western World nope I don't

5139.96 --> 5142.32
see him

5148.06 --> 5154.679
add them to add them to products yeah

5151.3 --> 5154.679
well good luck with that man

5155.44 --> 5159.219
it's definitely not just going to be

5157.659 --> 5161.08
standardized I mean there might be some

5159.219 --> 5163.0
corporations that will start doing that

5161.08 --> 5165.639
with their products well guess what's

5163.0 --> 5168.639
gonna happen to those corporations and

5165.639 --> 5171.76
their products people are gonna catch on

5168.639 --> 5174.219
because it's a health risk it is

5171.76 --> 5176.679
literally a health risk this is known

5174.219 --> 5179.139
it's medical knowledge

5176.679 --> 5181.659
that eating the bugs is a health risk

5179.139 --> 5183.400000000001
what people you think that people are

5181.659 --> 5185.62
just going to not

5183.4 --> 5190.5
know that

5185.62 --> 5190.5
and just eats the books I don't think so

5194.26 --> 5197.52
does that stop people

5198.58 --> 5203.94
buy the cricket Factory yeah well

5201.34 --> 5203.9400000000005
business

5204.4 --> 5209.5199999999995
dude maybe maybe they do it for China

5213.04 --> 5217.659
maybe they want slightly healthier

5215.38 --> 5220.7390000000005
quality bugs

5217.659 --> 5220.739
I don't know

5222.46 --> 5228.58
but I mean what's the point of creating

5224.8 --> 5230.9800000000005
all that when nobody's eating it

5228.58 --> 5233.199
you can't literally force people to eat

5230.98 --> 5236.259999999999
stuff that they don't want to eat

5233.199 --> 5238.62
like that's gonna make the Endeavor go

5236.26 --> 5238.62
bust

5239.199 --> 5243.159
yeah you can produce millions and

5241.719 --> 5244.96
millions of crickets it's literally

5243.159 --> 5247.259999999999
nobody's eating them you're gonna go

5244.96 --> 5247.26
bust

5247.719 --> 5252.179
doesn't matter if there's a giant

5249.58 --> 5252.179
Factory there

5260.56 --> 5264.88
yeah right QT industry it's just

5263.56 --> 5267.580000000001
industry

5264.88 --> 5269.5
making money

5267.58 --> 5271.0599999999995
somebody wants to eat bugs out there

5269.5 --> 5274.739
then yeah they're gonna make a factory

5271.06 --> 5279.219
and produce those bugs right

5274.739 --> 5282.28
but I mean they can't just force you to

5279.219 --> 5284.32
change your diet like that

5282.28 --> 5287.98
doesn't work like that people will not

5284.32 --> 5290.32
go along it will create a mob

5287.98 --> 5291.879999999999
Stampede situated like they're just not

5290.32 --> 5294.219
gonna accept it they're just gonna light

5291.88 --> 5296.32
everything on fire then like oh you

5294.219 --> 5298.659
you're gonna force that oh government oh

5296.32 --> 5301.36
you're you're doing okay well let's see

5298.659 --> 5304.138999999999
how well your building burns with you in

5301.36 --> 5304.139
it then

5308.32 --> 5313.679
would you go freaking eat your bugs

5310.42 --> 5313.679
We're not gonna eat them

5314.38 --> 5320.139
what with your stupid bureaucratic

5316.54 --> 5323.08
regulations and tax [ __ ] eventually

5320.139 --> 5324.639
they're gonna just Lynch you

5323.08 --> 5326.92
yeah

5324.639 --> 5331.08
you can't make people eat something

5326.92 --> 5331.08
that's not natural to them

5335.28 --> 5340.599999999999
yeah at best you can hope that they can

5338.139 --> 5342.9400000000005
be stupid enough to just do it

5340.6 --> 5344.620000000001
themselves

5342.94 --> 5346.0599999999995
because they don't know what the [ __ ]

5344.62 --> 5347.92
they're doing in their lives and they're

5346.06 --> 5350.860000000001
not educated properly and they don't

5347.92 --> 5353.7390000000005
have stable family life

5350.86 --> 5357.219
and then they'll just do it whatever

5353.739 --> 5360.459999999999
yeah I mean idiots might try it

5357.219 --> 5364.2390000000005
whatever trendys or whatever

5360.46 --> 5366.34
you can't make the entire public just

5364.239 --> 5368.32
change their diet all of a sudden it

5366.34 --> 5371.860000000001
doesn't work that way

5368.32 --> 5374.92
you're gonna get a mob

5371.86 --> 5376.239
an angry mob situation and if you do

5374.92 --> 5380.6990000000005
that

5376.239 --> 5380.699
yeah no government can handle that

5389.98 --> 5394.78
rubbish they put in their food now right

5392.32 --> 5398.08
well I don't get food with rubbish in it

5394.78 --> 5400.3
or see Oz

5398.08 --> 5402.76
and I wouldn't say that bugs would be

5400.3 --> 5405.1
the least of your worries because it its

5402.76 --> 5409.12
influence yeah the chatting

5405.1 --> 5413.38
the this exoskeleton toxin

5409.12 --> 5416.0199999999995
it compounds with other toxins

5413.38 --> 5419.32
so if you eat the bugs you get that crap

5416.02 --> 5425.5
in but you also eat like other chemical

5419.32 --> 5430.54
crap with taste enhancers and weird dyes

5425.5 --> 5434.26
and all that yeah it's gonna compound it

5430.54 --> 5437.26
yeah you combine it it multiplies

5434.26 --> 5442.26
it gets much worse yeah

5437.26 --> 5442.26
it doesn't work you can't make it work

5446.44 --> 5451.54
I mean the only place effectively where

5449.32 --> 5453.159
you can force people to eat bugs is in

5451.54 --> 5455.32
death camps

5453.159 --> 5457.42
where they're all just don't have rights

5455.32 --> 5460.36
and they can just die and then yeah get

5457.42 --> 5462.9
the box and then they will just die

5460.36 --> 5462.9
okay

5466.96 --> 5472.9
it's not gonna work

5468.94 --> 5475.08
there's no stable realistic outcome in

5472.9 --> 5475.08
which

5475.239 --> 5479.32
just

5476.5 --> 5483.36
the entire Western World can be made to

5479.32 --> 5483.36
eight bucks it's just not gonna happen

5495.42 --> 5500.28
right anyway I'm on T damn it

5510.76 --> 5515.9800000000005
something snails yes bugs now you

5514.12 --> 5517.659
know no I don't really like snails

5515.98 --> 5520.379999999999
either

5517.659 --> 5520.379999999999
yuck

5533.62 --> 5537.96
right Oz yeah

5547.9 --> 5550.138999999999
foreign

5553.02 --> 5558.06
I wouldn't really like eating ants

5559.48 --> 5564.718999999999
I mean it's not unhealthy apparently

5561.699 --> 5564.719
ants are like

5564.82 --> 5571.12
of insects they're slightly less toxic I

5569.8 --> 5574.54
think

5571.12 --> 5577.5599999999995
I'm just not gonna really do it though

5574.54 --> 5577.56
if you don't mind

5606.17 --> 5609.359
[Music]

5613.54 --> 5618.719
thank you

5616.179 --> 5618.719
before

5625.44 --> 5631.419999999999
Casey what for religious reasons she

5628.9 --> 5634.0199999999995
can't eat snails

5631.42 --> 5634.02
what

5634.36 --> 5638.86
what do you mean or are you talking bugs

5637.06 --> 5640.900000000001
what

5638.86 --> 5642.4
ants what are you talking about tour

5640.9 --> 5644.259999999999
Casey

5642.4 --> 5647.28
eat them

5644.26 --> 5647.280000000001
what them

5656.88 --> 5660.36
mushroom yeah yeah

5671.699 --> 5678.58
oh yeah that's cargo I see it now right

5675.94 --> 5683.58
why wouldn't you eat that for religious

5678.58 --> 5683.58
reasons I don't get it what religions

5684.04 --> 5689.34
snails aren't food

5686.04 --> 5689.34
Leviticus okay

5694.0 --> 5696.719
I guess

5697.179 --> 5701.8
although I probably just not eat snails

5700.179 --> 5705.719
no matter what because I think they're

5701.8 --> 5705.719
freaking gross to eat that is

5726.54 --> 5730.9
snails aren't food I don't know man it

5728.98 --> 5734.0199999999995
could be I just think they're really

5730.9 --> 5736.48
freaking gross if you don't mind but

5734.02 --> 5739.4800000000005
then again I feel the same way about

5736.48 --> 5739.48
squids

5739.719 --> 5743.92
so

5741.34 --> 5746.679
there's a lot of things I find or craps

5743.92 --> 5749.4400000000005
I find all of that really freaking gross

5746.679 --> 5751.6
well with crabs it's weird because I

5749.44 --> 5752.46
really like an actual crab cooked or

5751.6 --> 5754.54
whatever

5752.46 --> 5757.3
I don't

5754.54 --> 5761.699
know get away from me

5757.3 --> 5761.6990000000005
but crap chips yeah I'll eat that

5764.739 --> 5769.178999999999
you know same goes for fish I do not

5767.38 --> 5771.76
like eating fish

5769.179 --> 5774.4
but I'll take fish oh yeah

5771.76 --> 5777.88
absolutely

5774.4 --> 5781.199
snails however like why why the [ __ ]

5777.88 --> 5781.1990000000005
would you want to even eat those

5787.36 --> 5792.759999999999
but I mean yeah you're like really

5790.0 --> 5795.04
hungry or whatever and it's like snails

5792.76 --> 5797.1990000000005
everywhere then yeah I wouldn't wouldn't

5795.04 --> 5800.88
say like okay well you're crazy for

5797.199 --> 5800.879999999999
eating snails when I don't know

5801.4 --> 5807.349999999999
it can feed you sure

5804.24 --> 5807.349999999999
[Music]

5809.88 --> 5816.9400000000005
pork scratchings I don't know what that

5812.739 --> 5819.28
means but yeah I don't eat pig

5816.94 --> 5822.0
s are friends not food yeah I kind of

5819.28 --> 5822.0
agreed to that

5826.38 --> 5832.0
and arguably

5828.88 --> 5834.28
I agree with that with squids did you

5832.0 --> 5838.38
know that squids are actually really

5834.28 --> 5838.38
freaking intelligent and sentient

5851.26 --> 5856.2390000000005
it's really weird and tragic actually

5853.36 --> 5857.98
like that that squirts it's like a herd

5856.239 --> 5859.659
animal and you're like oh silly

5857.98 --> 5862.48
creatures

5859.659 --> 5864.04
like what is that but they're actually

5862.48 --> 5867.699
really

5864.04 --> 5869.679
sentient they have actual feelings

5867.699 --> 5872.638999999999
and fruit and they're really freaking

5869.679 --> 5872.639
smart and creative

5873.52 --> 5877.4800000000005
octopus yeah I don't know about octopus

5875.38 --> 5878.7390000000005
but I know squids right

5877.48 --> 5882.759999999999
with the

5878.739 --> 5887.259999999999
the typical squid those are really smart

5882.76 --> 5890.139
like really sentient level smart

5887.26 --> 5892.360000000001
like as smart as a dolphin arguably

5890.139 --> 5896.1990000000005
which is odd because dolphins do eat

5892.36 --> 5898.659
them but squids are really smart octopus

5896.199 --> 5899.739
octopi I don't know if they're that

5898.659 --> 5901.96
smart

5899.739 --> 5904.78
they're probably not super stupid but

5901.96 --> 5906.1
squids are actually really like weird

5904.78 --> 5908.08
smart

5906.1 --> 5910.0
they're actually really smart it's like

5908.08 --> 5911.92
you almost wonder like why why would

5910.0 --> 5915.12
that creature be so smart it's really

5911.92 --> 5915.12
weird but they are

5933.1 --> 5938.52
Octopus as smart as a three-year-old

5934.9 --> 5938.5199999999995
yeah yeah that sounds about right

5942.52 --> 5947.56
squids um cuttlefish I might mix them up

5945.88 --> 5951.46
squids and cuttlefish are they really

5947.56 --> 5954.6990000000005
that different squids in a cuttlefish

5951.46 --> 5957.96
because I might mean cuttlefish I just

5954.699 --> 5957.96
kind of call it squid

5958.42 --> 5962.02
but if you're saying they're like kind

5959.98 --> 5965.28
of different species then I might

5962.02 --> 5965.280000000001
actually mean cuttlefish

5969.82 --> 5974.92
anyway I don't like it I don't like to

5971.8 --> 5977.92
eat them and I feel guilty

5974.92 --> 5981.82
against well I guess a couple fish or

5977.92 --> 5986.159
squid I'm like no leave them alone

5981.82 --> 5986.159
just like I'd say that with a pig really

5993.219 --> 5997.32
I think I'm gonna round out the show

5997.42 --> 6000.9800000000005
I really want to get some lunch

6008.52 --> 6014.9400000000005
chicken marinated in swamp water yeah

6012.06 --> 6019.219
that does not sound great either slow mo

6014.94 --> 6019.219
buggy now I wouldn't eat turtle

6019.26 --> 6025.9800000000005
s are nice or I like turtles

6024.239 --> 6027.78
it would be awesome to like have a

6025.98 --> 6030.0199999999995
generational turtle that you could have

6027.78 --> 6030.0199999999995
like

6030.36 --> 6035.339999999999
that would be

6032.52 --> 6037.5
that could like I'd live your your

6035.34 --> 6039.360000000001
Offspring even

6037.5 --> 6041.159
that sounds like a really awesome thing

6039.36 --> 6043.38
if you had like a family Turtle that's

6041.159 --> 6045.86
been in the family for five or six

6043.38 --> 6045.86
Generations

6045.9 --> 6048.199
foreign

6052.8 --> 6057.8
would be pretty cool right having a

6055.199 --> 6057.799999999999
family turtle

6061.44 --> 6064.919999999999
I mean how epic would it be if you just

6063.48 --> 6067.44
had this story like yeah we have this

6064.92 --> 6069.0
family Turtle like our great great

6067.44 --> 6071.699
grandfather

6069.0 --> 6074.639
literally like went to

6071.699 --> 6078.0599999999995
like in the in the 90s or 18th century

6074.639 --> 6080.159000000001
went to that country and caught it as a

6078.06 --> 6082.9800000000005
little turtle brought it home and now

6080.159 --> 6085.4
it's like this big how awesome would

6082.98 --> 6085.4
that be

6108.06 --> 6113.119000000001
what's the difference between a turtle

6110.219 --> 6113.119
and a tortoise

6113.219 --> 6119.9
I don't know if it has something to do

6115.619 --> 6119.9
with with the shell I think

6121.08 --> 6126.0599999999995
like I think it's like the the shape of

6124.5 --> 6126.9
the shell is slightly different or

6126.06 --> 6129.7390000000005
something

6126.9 --> 6129.739
not sure

6131.84 --> 6137.58
oh God another squirt boy bye

6183.92 --> 6189.96
right but I mean tortoise and turtle is

6187.44 --> 6192.0
like the difference between an alligator

6189.96 --> 6195.38
and a crocodile right

6192.0 --> 6195.38
it's not that big a difference

6209.48 --> 6214.32
yeah the price about him good to see you

6211.98 --> 6215.879999999999
by the way but I am actually gonna round

6214.32 --> 6220.259999999999
out

6215.88 --> 6223.26
so let's we are eating animals

6220.26 --> 6225.4400000000005
subject is not really my uh my cup of

6223.26 --> 6225.4400000000005
tea

6229.639 --> 6233.28
okay those are smarter than while we are

6232.44 --> 6236.96
they

6233.28 --> 6236.96
I don't know is that true

6237.719 --> 6240.32
whatever

6249.6 --> 6252.26
hmm

6265.46 --> 6272.639
right anyway I am gonna run out

6269.4 --> 6274.379999999999
oh there's the Blue Sky gone damn it

6272.639 --> 6276.3
it's graying up

6274.38 --> 6278.639
uh there's still some sun though I'm

6276.3 --> 6281.400000000001
gonna catch that when I go out

6278.639 --> 6284.34

so yeah and I wanted to by the way I

6296.1 --> 6300.119000000001
