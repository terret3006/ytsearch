yeah

84.56 --> 91.52
i got the members only chat on

88.08 --> 93.03999999999999
and let's see what happens

91.52 --> 96.96
because

93.04 --> 96.96000000000001
anyway let's get to the weather first

97.28 --> 102.32000000000001
yeah

98.32 --> 102.32
not great it's kind of rainy

103.119 --> 107.439
gray

104.399 --> 107.43900000000001
not super cold

109.52 --> 112.15899999999999
but yeah

113.04 --> 115.84
i

115.92 --> 121.84
have newspapers to deliver but i'm like

119.84 --> 123.60000000000001
in real doubt whether i'm gonna do it or

121.84 --> 127.43900000000001
not

123.6 --> 130.399
because on the front page again

127.439 --> 133.92
is corona stuff and this time i was

130.399 --> 136.16
really unpleasantly surprised by that

133.92 --> 138.48
because it said like oh yeah you can get

136.16 --> 141.44
your corona vaccines in this in this

138.48 --> 144.64
location here in utrecht

141.44 --> 144.64
and i'm like i

145.12 --> 149.84
i feel i don't want to be

147.28 --> 151.92
partially responsible for

149.84 --> 153.12
yeah launching a suggestion like that

151.92 --> 155.51899999999998
too

153.12 --> 157.68
unsuspecting and

155.519 --> 159.92000000000002
not in the know people

157.68 --> 163.84
out there even though it will probably

159.92 --> 163.83999999999997
happen to them anyway at some point

164.959 --> 169.36
so

167.2 --> 173.51899999999998
i'm gonna just yeah by the way hello

169.36 --> 173.519
eagle playing anchor good to see you ah

176.56 --> 182.08
but i'm gonna read

179.28 --> 185.92
through it later in the day

182.08 --> 189.12
when i'm going out for groceries

185.92 --> 191.04
get a couple of things

189.12 --> 193.59900000000002
and i'm just gonna read through it to

191.04 --> 193.599
make sure

194.0 --> 199.36
like what it is like whether it's

196.239 --> 201.519
actually truly a pro vaccine article or

199.36 --> 203.36
if they're just kind of like a 10 trying

201.519 --> 205.59900000000002
to attention draw playing this weird

203.36 --> 205.59900000000002
game

205.84 --> 210.159
i'll figure it out but yeah i've been

207.84 --> 213.36
dissatisfied with the way the the

210.159 --> 214.879
newspaper that i delivered looks in the

213.36 --> 216.56
recent month

214.879 --> 217.92
few months

216.56 --> 222.68
and

217.92 --> 222.67999999999998
i might decide to just skip it again

227.12 --> 231.28
and yeah i'm getting really fed up i'm

229.36 --> 233.68
also being kind of tolerant because i

231.28 --> 235.92
said i would

233.68 --> 237.59900000000002
call in my resignation but at the same

235.92 --> 238.79899999999998
time i feel

237.599 --> 241.599
like

238.799 --> 242.72
i almost like need

241.599 --> 245.439
it

242.72 --> 248.959
on a regular ba while on a weekly basis

245.439 --> 254.0
just to do it not even to make money

248.959 --> 255.2
but i like i like doing it in a way

254.0 --> 258.56
keeps me

255.2 --> 261.359
if it gets me out of this room

258.56 --> 264.24
and yeah even though it's just a minor

261.359 --> 268.28
job it makes me at least sort of feel

264.24 --> 268.28000000000003
productive for a little

270.0 --> 274.479
because i

271.28 --> 275.75899999999996
sometimes have issues with that

274.479 --> 278.639
right so

275.759 --> 282.32
i watch back yesterday's show

278.639 --> 284.72
and the first hour was like really good

282.32 --> 286.639
and then suddenly like i completely lost

284.72 --> 289.68
my patience

286.639 --> 289.68
like something just

291.52 --> 294.88
not even snapped it just like i got fed

294.16 --> 297.6
up

294.88 --> 298.639
i got fed up but by

297.6 --> 302.0
what

298.639 --> 302.0
was happening in my chat

302.16 --> 306.32000000000005
and then yeah i started yeah i let in

305.039 --> 309.199
the

306.32 --> 311.52
curse words it was very distinct

309.199 --> 314.56
it was very telling like as i was doing

311.52 --> 316.639
it i was barely even noticing it

314.56 --> 319.52
but watching it back i definitely

316.639 --> 323.56
noticed that and that was not good

319.52 --> 323.56
that was not good at all

324.96 --> 330.71999999999997
i think i might have even like ruined

327.84 --> 333.19899999999996
some people's days with that

330.72 --> 334.24
that did not have bad intentions just by

333.199 --> 336.08
being

334.24 --> 338.56
dragged into that

336.08 --> 340.8
very unhappy about it

338.56 --> 340.8
right

343.199 --> 346.8
partially

344.639 --> 350.16
yeah there is a chat george sanford it's

346.8 --> 350.16
just the members only chat

350.24 --> 357.16
oh and wrenches so that's still a lot of

353.28 --> 357.15999999999997
people hold on

371.94 --> 375.84
[Music]

373.199 --> 376.17
right mods can chat

375.84 --> 377.84
so

376.17 --> 379.84000000000003
[Music]

377.84 --> 382.15999999999997
it's basically going to be familiar

379.84 --> 382.15999999999997
crowd

387.84 --> 392.4
i'm just gonna try it out because yeah a

390.08 --> 393.919
lot of people got wrenches

392.4 --> 396.56
and plenty of

393.919 --> 398.31899999999996
subscribers too

396.56 --> 400.0
and i have to thank them too you know i

398.319 --> 403.84000000000003
have to be more thankful

400.0 --> 409.16
i've noticed this but it's also been

403.84 --> 409.15999999999997
just a long term lifelong problem

409.84 --> 414.56
is that when i feel good

412.0 --> 415.52
i have a lot of a lot of like courtesy

414.56 --> 417.36
in me

415.52 --> 418.56
courtesy

417.36 --> 421.28000000000003
get

418.56 --> 423.84
like i want the happiness to basically

421.28 --> 425.919
rub off on everybody

423.84 --> 427.919
it's a very good habit i think and like

425.919 --> 432.15999999999997
people that do that make other people

427.919 --> 432.15999999999997
happy and other people appreciate that

432.4 --> 436.56
makes them more pleasant to be around

434.08 --> 439.19899999999996
but when i feel

436.56 --> 442.0
not so happy

439.199 --> 444.24
then with me kind of the reverse happens

442.0 --> 444.24
and

444.319 --> 449.599
when i try to shut off

446.56 --> 452.639
from letting that out

449.599 --> 455.44
then suddenly courtesies drop

452.639 --> 455.44
like i don't

456.72 --> 460.96000000000004
i still say like hello to people

460.08 --> 464.0
but

460.96 --> 467.75899999999996
normally when i feel good i would rather

464.0 --> 470.08
be initiators of contact like that and

467.759 --> 472.24
now i'm just

470.08 --> 475.84
more and more retractive and i've

472.24 --> 475.84000000000003
noticed that in the recent month

476.08 --> 481.68
and then i'm not as cautious cautious

479.52 --> 481.68
just

482.8 --> 488.319
and yeah that makes me feel really bad

486.4 --> 490.84
it's like it makes me

488.319 --> 493.03900000000004
just think like wow i must look like

490.84 --> 494.71999999999997
ugly now

493.039 --> 496.96
not even ugly

494.72 --> 496.96000000000004
just

498.08 --> 505.4
not the pleasant guy and i miss it

501.28 --> 505.4
so maybe i'm just missing

506.24 --> 510.24
moods

507.759 --> 512.0
also yeah my finances are not great

510.24 --> 515.279
right now

512.0 --> 517.76
i have five euros

515.279 --> 517.76
that's it

518.719 --> 521.719
uh

524.32 --> 527.279
just gonna have to survive on that

526.08 --> 528.9590000000001
somehow

527.279 --> 531.519
but it pretty much means that there's

528.959 --> 534.56
not gonna be anything i can smoke except

531.519 --> 538.48
for just tobaccos in the next

534.56 --> 538.4799999999999
who knows how long it's gonna take

545.36 --> 549.36
some lucky

547.12 --> 550.8
tomorrow

549.36 --> 553.04
right uh

550.8 --> 553.04
and

554.56 --> 560.7199999999999
yeah more debt issue so yeah financially

557.2 --> 560.72
i'm not looking really good right now

561.839 --> 564.6400000000001
think that

565.76 --> 570.56
like my in my attempt to basically try

568.399 --> 573.6
to forget about it as much as i can

570.56 --> 576.16
because there is on the other hand a

573.6 --> 578.9590000000001
better outlook right through the crypto

576.16 --> 581.12
situation through my dad

578.959 --> 584.399
but

581.12 --> 587.04
like i'm very wary

584.399 --> 588.8
of trusting

587.04 --> 591.12
on some kind of better thing that's

588.8 --> 593.1999999999999
supposed to be approaching because like

591.12 --> 595.92
i'm very wary about it because i get the

593.2 --> 595.9200000000001
feeling that

599.36 --> 603.44
like things could

600.959 --> 605.1199999999999
get chaotic in some ways and it's just

603.44 --> 607.36
not gonna happen

605.12 --> 607.36
right

607.519 --> 611.68
might change for the better

609.279 --> 614.32
it's just not good enough a promise at

611.68 --> 616.9899999999999
this point for me to

614.32 --> 620.1590000000001
switch my mood around

616.99 --> 620.159
[Music]

621.04 --> 626.079
right and in the meantime financially

623.04 --> 626.079
i'm kind of stuck now

631.76 --> 635.68
all right anyway uh hello george sanford

634.16 --> 638.24
and amanda young

635.68 --> 640.16
good to see you too

638.24 --> 645.16
i was wondering amanda you haven't seen

640.16 --> 645.16
a lot of you been very busy i think

646.64 --> 649.959
green tea

652.61 --> 657.46
[Music]

668.48 --> 672.72
yeah amanda you always work hard go

671.6 --> 676.0
but

672.72 --> 676.0
it's okay like

676.8 --> 680.56
like a lot of people like including you

679.519 --> 682.399
guys

680.56 --> 685.279
in the world are just

682.399 --> 687.279
getting it right now getting a lot of

685.279 --> 690.32
[ __ ]

687.279 --> 692.64
directly or indirectly

690.32 --> 696.0
because

692.64 --> 699.68
a lot of businesses are just suffering

696.0 --> 699.68
and then even if you're like a

700.959 --> 704.399
partial worker

702.56 --> 706.4799999999999
you're gonna get

704.399 --> 709.519
confronted with a lot of bummed out

706.48 --> 709.519
people too so

716.0 --> 719.279
gotta turn it around

723.12 --> 727.76
right also i i want to address something

725.92 --> 728.8389999999999
and it is

727.76 --> 730.399
yeah i've

728.839 --> 732.639
been

730.399 --> 732.639
well

733.68 --> 739.1999999999999
i i think it's allergies i think i have

736.8 --> 741.1999999999999
allergies

739.2 --> 744.88
it's because i've been just an

741.2 --> 748.0790000000001
inexplicable amount of

744.88 --> 750.079
being snotty and [ __ ] and sneezing

748.079 --> 752.2399999999999
but it's not like a

750.079 --> 754.079
i don't have like an infection anywhere

752.24 --> 756.72
or anything it's not like the flu or

754.079 --> 758.4799999999999
[ __ ] it's just constantly

756.72 --> 760.32
especially in the mornings and it's been

758.48 --> 761.6
getting worse especially in the last two

760.32 --> 763.6800000000001
months

761.6 --> 766.32
so i've noticed that that's also been

763.68 --> 768.56
pissing me off

766.32 --> 770.639
because like

768.56 --> 772.959
having those types of symptoms even

770.639 --> 774.639
though it may be allergies and i could

772.959 --> 776.959
even think of a way to do something

774.639 --> 778.0
about it but i don't have the finances i

776.959 --> 779.76
just

778.0 --> 781.92
have to sit through it somehow i hope it

779.76 --> 785.8389999999999
will go away

781.92 --> 788.16
but yeah people when they see

785.839 --> 789.2790000000001
they'll they'll be afraid it's coveted

788.16 --> 791.519
or something

789.279 --> 793.36
like the other day i accidentally just

791.519 --> 795.76
out of nowhere just had

793.36 --> 798.88
a giant sneeze in the middle of the

795.76 --> 801.279
grocery store and it was like

798.88 --> 803.12
like [ __ ]

801.279 --> 805.68
damn it

803.12 --> 807.36
it's like everybody heard that of course

805.68 --> 809.4399999999999
nobody does that anymore i don't know

807.36 --> 811.6
how people can prevent it or if like

809.44 --> 816.399
everybody knows how to prevent it

811.6 --> 816.399
somehow but it just happened exploded

816.56 --> 820.3199999999999
and that's just bad it's like

823.36 --> 828.32
can't sneeze anymore

825.199 --> 830.56
not really it's like a bad thing now

828.32 --> 834.32
it's demoralizing it

830.56 --> 834.3199999999999
what kind of world has this become

835.199 --> 842.92
and i've always had periods like this

837.839 --> 842.9200000000001
it's just kind of unpredictable to me

845.92 --> 849.92
but i think it is allergy so

850.079 --> 856.56
once some kind of financial situation

853.279 --> 858.72
happens and then finally

856.56 --> 862.8
can creep out of this

858.72 --> 862.8000000000001
pile of [ __ ] and actually grow

863.04 --> 865.68
as a tree

869.36 --> 876.8000000000001
yeah who knows maybe

872.8 --> 876.8
i will i will try to get this

878.8 --> 883.519
anti-allergy thing

881.12 --> 886.079
and then a natural form it's based on

883.519 --> 888.639
quail eggs i want to try it and then

886.079 --> 891.12
maybe it'll freaking go away

888.639 --> 894.48
it'll just go away

891.12 --> 894.48
finally rid of this [ __ ]

896.32 --> 899.7600000000001
yep

897.199 --> 902.079
sneezing feels great george sanford okay

899.76 --> 902.079
that's

902.48 --> 907.12
that's very nice that you think that but

905.44 --> 909.9200000000001
with me it does quite to say the

907.12 --> 912.24
opposite actually

909.92 --> 914.639
i sneeze and then i start to get all

912.24 --> 914.639
runny

915.04 --> 919.76
and it stops though it stops being runny

917.68 --> 921.8389999999999
so it's not like continue that's

919.76 --> 923.68
typically a cold

921.839 --> 924.8000000000001
right

923.68 --> 927.12
but it does

924.8 --> 929.8389999999999
happen and the sneezing just really

927.12 --> 931.44
happens out of nowhere it's like

929.839 --> 933.6
just everything is fine normally and

931.44 --> 936.1600000000001
then

933.6 --> 939.75
this giant pulse right

936.16 --> 942.909
that's i think that's typically allergy

939.75 --> 942.909
[Music]

947.44 --> 951.9200000000001
right so i guess it's snowing over there

952.32 --> 957.639
it's not snowing over here it's just

954.639 --> 957.639
rainy

974.56 --> 977.6389999999999
all right

978.51 --> 987.659
[Music]

994.65 --> 997.85
[Music]

1021.1 --> 1024.97
[Music]

1023.68 --> 1026.1599999999999
all right

1024.97 --> 1027.28
[Music]

1026.16 --> 1028.959
also

1027.28 --> 1031.839
yeah

1028.959 --> 1031.8390000000002
i've had some

1031.919 --> 1035.919
things in my mind that i've been wanting

1033.919 --> 1038.72
to put to paper

1035.919 --> 1040.88
basically categorizing

1038.72 --> 1042.72
types of social communication and how

1040.88 --> 1044.88
they're different

1042.72 --> 1046.799
like when you do things like when you're

1044.88 --> 1048.88
for example in chat

1046.799 --> 1050.48
or when you're

1048.88 --> 1052.96
on voice

1050.48 --> 1055.2
only

1052.96 --> 1058.08
and anonymous

1055.2 --> 1060.16
and when you're just fully on camera on

1058.08 --> 1062.1599999999999
the internet and then the difference

1060.16 --> 1063.28
with every

1062.16 --> 1065.52
approach

1063.28 --> 1067.2
versus just

1065.52 --> 1069.76
you out there

1067.2 --> 1072.4
you out there with friends

1069.76 --> 1074.32
and out there on at work like and how

1072.4 --> 1077.039
that all works how all these different

1074.32 --> 1078.8799999999999
types of social interactions work

1077.039 --> 1081.12
differently

1078.88 --> 1084.0
because i i want to study that it's like

1081.12 --> 1088.6399999999999
part of trying to understand like just

1084.0 --> 1088.64
how how to go about in ways

1088.72 --> 1094.0
well when i try to put it to paper

1091.12 --> 1095.52
it's not as cohesive as it is in my mind

1094.0 --> 1097.76
and even like

1095.52 --> 1098.799
the cohesion in my mind just breaks

1097.76 --> 1100.64
apart

1098.799 --> 1103.36
as i'm trying to put things down is

1100.64 --> 1103.3600000000001
really weird

1104.4 --> 1108.48
it makes me feel almost like i'm not

1106.24 --> 1109.6
allowed to do that

1108.48 --> 1112.4
just

1109.6 --> 1117.12
sabotage

1112.4 --> 1117.1200000000001
from the inside for some damn reason

1117.76 --> 1123.039
but maybe it's

1120.64 --> 1127.6000000000001
just because i'm a bit rusty

1123.039 --> 1127.6
and being demoralized also doesn't help

1128.0 --> 1133.52
but i'm thinking of basically laying out

1130.64 --> 1134.48
some kind of a map for that

1133.52 --> 1138.24
and then

1134.48 --> 1138.24
i'll be able to address that

1139.28 --> 1145.0
like on the show

1140.72 --> 1145.0
talk about it some more

1147.83 --> 1150.9399999999998
[Music]

1151.36 --> 1156.0
and in the past i've i've used drawings

1154.0 --> 1159.28
and schematics

1156.0 --> 1162.0
sketches rather

1159.28 --> 1164.24
and that's always been very successful

1162.0 --> 1166.88
but every single one of them was always

1164.24 --> 1168.799
just made very impulsively

1166.88 --> 1170.5590000000002
it's like an order from the inside you

1168.799 --> 1172.24
got to do it and then you just got to do

1170.559 --> 1174.96
it and it works it's no obstruction

1172.24 --> 1174.96
whatsoever

1175.679 --> 1181.039
but yeah it's been a while it's been a

1177.84 --> 1181.039
while since that happened

1182.48 --> 1188.16
it's almost in ways also because yeah

1185.44 --> 1190.8400000000001
those things were truly flat earth

1188.16 --> 1194.64
mechanical inspired

1190.84 --> 1196.32
and oh every conception that i have now

1194.64 --> 1198.24
to basically

1196.32 --> 1199.9189999999999
defend the flat earth or explain the

1198.24 --> 1201.039
flat earth and

1199.919 --> 1203.5200000000002
break down

1201.039 --> 1205.44
globe mechanics

1203.52 --> 1206.6399999999999
it's all just worked out like there's

1205.44 --> 1208.48
almost

1206.64 --> 1210.7990000000002
well there is really nothing more to

1208.48 --> 1214.799
even update like i got it got the

1210.799 --> 1217.2
relative density part completely down

1214.799 --> 1220.36
note all the inside the arguments inside

1217.2 --> 1220.3600000000001
and out

1221.84 --> 1226.8799999999999
don't know everything concerning math

1224.32 --> 1226.8799999999999
and all that

1227.36 --> 1230.799
but i can describe it all

1231.28 --> 1235.84
in ways that other people can understand

1236.88 --> 1243.3600000000001
and now it's just kind of done it's done

1239.52 --> 1245.44
it's like almost like my my job is done

1243.36 --> 1247.4399999999998
it feels like sometimes and i play the

1245.44 --> 1250.159
baller

1247.44 --> 1253.28
i can do that

1250.159 --> 1258.0800000000002
but it's also a bit weirding me out

1253.28 --> 1260.799
because when i play that i play into old

1258.08 --> 1263.52
parts of myself

1260.799 --> 1265.039
of when i really used to be that guy and

1263.52 --> 1267.039
i'm doing it

1265.039 --> 1269.2
as i would have done that

1267.039 --> 1270.559
all those years ago but it's a different

1269.2 --> 1272.32
world now

1270.559 --> 1275.6789999999999
and the weird thing is is that in

1272.32 --> 1278.0
visions i even experienced it as such

1275.679 --> 1280.5590000000002
like way back then

1278.0 --> 1284.08
when i had nowhere to go with it

1280.559 --> 1286.24
i had like dreams

1284.08 --> 1288.559
where i would and guess what they came

1286.24 --> 1288.559
true

1288.96 --> 1293.52
i did it i just thought it was a dream

1292.159 --> 1295.2800000000002
originally

1293.52 --> 1297.6
i was kind of like

1295.28 --> 1299.9189999999999
my spirit then stuck

1297.6 --> 1301.76
was able to continue

1299.919 --> 1304.4
within these dreams and it's like i

1301.76 --> 1305.76
dreamed something that i did in the

1304.4 --> 1306.96
future

1305.76 --> 1310.24
that would

1306.96 --> 1312.4
alleviate that spirit in that moment of

1310.24 --> 1315.52
myself

1312.4 --> 1318.0
it's very odd but i feel like it's kind

1315.52 --> 1320.08
of done now

1318.0 --> 1323.84
and their only thing that's left is to

1320.08 --> 1325.9189999999999
deal with the psychology of these

1323.84 --> 1327.28
these people that are really stuck

1325.919 --> 1329.44
really

1327.28 --> 1332.44
fallen down into just

1329.44 --> 1332.44
self-delusion

1338.64 --> 1344.159
and like do i want to deal with that

1341.679 --> 1346.64
constantly

1344.159 --> 1348.5590000000002
it's kind of messing me up

1346.64 --> 1351.679
and yesterday was a demonstration that

1348.559 --> 1351.6789999999999
it's kind of messing me up

1353.36 --> 1360.0
it's almost like i've

1355.44 --> 1363.28
developed a bit of an allergy to it

1360.0 --> 1365.36
it's like i'm just fed up with the lying

1363.28 --> 1367.36
in general like with the

1365.36 --> 1371.24
the tone of it

1367.36 --> 1371.24
for whatever reason

1378.64 --> 1382.76
hey hello nathan

1395.2 --> 1399.28
all right yeah nathan you're right the

1397.44 --> 1401.52
the featured trailers

1399.28 --> 1404.08

1401.52 --> 1404.08
pretty cool

1407.84 --> 1413.4399999999998
i was wondering about that

1410.08 --> 1415.6789999999999
nobody's mentioned anything about it

1413.44 --> 1417.52
i thought that i mentioned it maybe i

1415.679 --> 1419.44
forgot

1417.52 --> 1420.07
but it's pretty cool yeah sure you you

1419.44 --> 1423.16

1432.32 --> 1437.6
well i haven't really done a premiere in

1434.88 --> 1437.6000000000001
a long time

1441.919 --> 1446.3200000000002
but yeah if i'm going to at some point

1444.799 --> 1449.12
play a premiere

1446.32 --> 1451.6
then i'll definitely like figure out how

1449.12 --> 1453.4399999999998

1451.6 --> 1456.0
if i can't figure it out i'll i will

thanks for offering

1466.48 --> 1470.3600000000001
ah there's the link

1477.2 --> 1483.3600000000001
right how long can you make those

1478.96 --> 1483.3600000000001

1511.2 --> 1516.679
for what you're doing it's it's a great

1513.279 --> 1516.679
feature indeed

1540.84 --> 1546.72
right has anybody heard of owen benjamin

1544.24 --> 1546.72
by the way

1550.559 --> 1554.72
i've barely mentioned him in recent

1553.039 --> 1558.64
times

1554.72 --> 1558.64
but even like on his bit shoot

1559.52 --> 1563.679
i'm not seeing him

1561.6 --> 1566.1589999999999
like he there's clips and there's old

1563.679 --> 1568.3200000000002
things but he's not doing uploads

1566.159 --> 1571.1200000000001
anymore so it seems so i wonder like how

1568.32 --> 1573.4399999999998
he's doing

1571.12 --> 1574.8799999999999
or is bitchu getting in the way and he's

1573.44 --> 1577.2
now streaming somewhere else and

1574.88 --> 1579.2
uploading it because

1577.2 --> 1582.679
i don't know where i haven't seen him in

1579.2 --> 1582.679
a in a while

1591.919 --> 1594.4
yeah

1593.12 --> 1598.84
31

1594.4 --> 1598.8400000000001
january january 31st

1603.279 --> 1607.919
right but it's just a very short little

1611.44 --> 1611.44
all clip

1617.36 --> 1620.0
maybe this is

1620.159 --> 1624.8400000000001
there's like a lot of uploads but i

1621.84 --> 1624.84
think

1626.559 --> 1629.559
nope

1648.48 --> 1652.559
all right so the last

1650.559 --> 1656.96
full stream upload

1652.559 --> 1659.36
yeah 28th was a 30-minute thing

1656.96 --> 1661.8400000000001
27th

1659.36 --> 1663.76
was a full show basically but other than

1661.84 --> 1668.52
that i haven't really seen anything from

1663.76 --> 1668.52
him in a while don't even know why

1677.12 --> 1680.6399999999999
yeah amanda young i know my

1681.12 --> 1686.6399999999999
oh birthday

what can i say about my 40th 40th year

1686.64 --> 1692.679
oh god

1688.72 --> 1692.679

1713.039 --> 1716.559
happy 400th

1719.919 --> 1722.5590000000002
400

1723.279 --> 1726.32
yeah that's gonna be right after my

1725.2 --> 1729.44
birthday

1726.32 --> 1729.4399999999998
oh wait to eight hundred

1730.799 --> 1733.9189999999999
what's with the four

1736.84 --> 1744.1589999999999
hundredths oh i am for oh right oh right

1740.799 --> 1744.1589999999999
yeah yeah yeah of course

1744.559 --> 1749.12
yeah i forget sometimes the amnesian all

1747.12 --> 1751.1999999999998
really

1749.12 --> 1754.9599999999998
really made me believe that i'm just

1751.2 --> 1754.96
this guy born in 1980

1756.08 --> 1760.29
just this implant of growing up and all

1758.24 --> 1763.36
that

1760.29 --> 1767.48
[Music]

1763.36 --> 1767.4799999999998
i don't know why i did it

1769.679 --> 1771.919
no

1772.399 --> 1776.2399999999998
no man i don't think i can i can get

1774.72 --> 1778.32
that old

1776.24 --> 1780.88
like even if it was just medically

1778.32 --> 1782.72
possible i think that this anger in me

1780.88 --> 1785.0390000000002
it's a problem it's always been a

1782.72 --> 1785.039
problem

1786.48 --> 1790.64
or rat it's not even the anger it's that

1790.88 --> 1796.64
i'm able to withhold it

1794.24 --> 1798.88
without it completely burning me out and

1796.64 --> 1801.2
sabotaging me from the inside i think

1798.88 --> 1803.0390000000002
that that is it's just this way of way

1801.2 --> 1804.88
of dealing with a very specific type of

1803.039 --> 1809.64
frustration and i think that my mother

1804.88 --> 1809.64
had exactly the same problem that's

1813.76 --> 1816.08
right

1816.159 --> 1820.0800000000002
but she dealt with it in an entirely

1818.08 --> 1822.96
different way

1820.08 --> 1826.08
like she was much

1822.96 --> 1828.48
well one would say braver but also more

1826.08 --> 1831.279
reckless that way

1828.48 --> 1833.84
just doing everything and just

1831.279 --> 1834.799
taking a whole bunch of responsibilities

1833.84 --> 1838.0
that

1834.799 --> 1841.039
in ways she really couldn't handle

1838.0 --> 1841.039
was such a strain

1843.919 --> 1847.96
to barely handle herself

1850.48 --> 1855.6
but she did great though

1853.679 --> 1858.3990000000001
really like professionally she was

1855.6 --> 1861.519
really excellent

1858.399 --> 1864.76
it's worth admiring and in that i feel

1861.519 --> 1864.76
like i

1872.08 --> 1875.84
like

1874.32 --> 1878.72
i could have done better i've done

1875.84 --> 1881.039
better in ways than her

1878.72 --> 1882.64
but at the same time

1881.039 --> 1884.08
i've gone

1882.64 --> 1886.0
yeah i

1884.08 --> 1888.399
i don't know i don't know where this is

1886.0 --> 1889.519
eventually gonna lead to you know me

1888.399 --> 1892.9189999999999
doing this

1889.519 --> 1892.919
i don't know

1894.96 --> 1899.039
i just feel like

1896.399 --> 1901.9189999999999
i regret a lot of choices but then i

1899.039 --> 1905.399
just wonder like is that really a choice

1901.919 --> 1905.3990000000001
or is it just

1906.399 --> 1911.5189999999998
inability to

1909.279 --> 1913.76
make the way through the circumstances

1911.519 --> 1916.3990000000001
that you want to

1913.76 --> 1918.8799999999999
is that it

1916.399 --> 1920.6399999999999
now i'm talking about older stuff

1918.88 --> 1922.7990000000002
just

1920.64 --> 1925.1200000000001
walking up to this because i'm not

1922.799 --> 1927.44
really satisfied with where i am oh

1925.12 --> 1929.6789999999999
surprise surprise

1927.44 --> 1931.8400000000001
even though it is good and i'm very

1929.679 --> 1933.2
happy with

1931.84 --> 1936.6399999999999
the online

1933.2 --> 1939.039
people that i've gotten to know

1936.64 --> 1941.279
like i've got great or what it feels

1939.039 --> 1943.76
like colleagues on the flatter side i've

1941.279 --> 1946.559
got a team

1943.76 --> 1948.799
that really accepts me for who i am even

1946.559 --> 1949.9189999999999
though sometimes

1948.799 --> 1952.48
yeah i

1949.919 --> 1953.76
do bring up question marks in certain

1952.48 --> 1955.919
people

1953.76 --> 1957.44
because i am kind of weird but yeah

1955.919 --> 1960.5590000000002
they've seen where they're out there you

1957.44 --> 1963.2
know we are dealing with baller so

1960.559 --> 1966.1589999999999
yeah in relation to ballers

1963.2 --> 1970.24
i'm doing great right

1966.159 --> 1970.24
relation to everything else out there

1974.08 --> 1979.279
i don't know

1977.36 --> 1980.7199999999998
uh weirdly enough when you look at it

1979.279 --> 1982.0
from an outside

1980.72 --> 1983.3600000000001
view

1982.0 --> 1987.12
then maybe

1983.36 --> 1987.12
i'm just kind of front running

1987.279 --> 1990.799
problems

1988.399 --> 1993.279
psychological problems like i've been

1990.799 --> 1996.8799999999999
dealing with certain types of issues and

1993.279 --> 1996.88
isolations and pacifism

1996.96 --> 2002.559
like neurotic pacifisms not

1999.519 --> 2002.559
not a good thing

2003.12 --> 2009.6789999999999
even though yeah violence pacifism too

2005.6 --> 2013.6789999999999
you know that's that's the one advantage

2009.679 --> 2013.679
never get physically violent ever

2014.559 --> 2020.0
like because of frustrations very happy

2017.36 --> 2023.6789999999999
you know i get heated i never get

2020.0 --> 2026.32
physically violent ever never ever been

2023.679 --> 2028.64
on like even when i could have

2026.32 --> 2030.559
no it's just like

2028.64 --> 2033.5590000000002
that's where the pacifism is kind of

2030.559 --> 2033.559
useful

2034.24 --> 2039.76
but that same mechanism to hold you back

2036.64 --> 2042.96
can also kind of be used against you

2039.76 --> 2046.519
from the inside by a bad mood

2042.96 --> 2046.519
or by self-doubt

2048.8 --> 2053.119
and at the same time

2050.48 --> 2055.919
the isolation makes the sensitive

2053.119 --> 2058.7200000000003
socially sensitive parts

2055.919 --> 2062.56
more sensitive

2058.72 --> 2062.56
then you got to deal with that somehow

2063.52 --> 2068.32
and yeah the funny it's not really funny

2066.079 --> 2070.96
but the funny thing is

2068.32 --> 2073.76
that now in general there's just more

2070.96 --> 2077.04
people kind of being shoved

2073.76 --> 2077.0400000000004
in the same position

2077.599 --> 2084.079
so the problems that i've dealt with

2080.8 --> 2084.079
almost all my life

2084.879 --> 2087.5989999999997
well

2085.76 --> 2089.9190000000003
the rest of the world could potentially

2087.599 --> 2092.8
learn something of me

2089.919 --> 2093.7599999999998
my struggles like that so that's kind of

2092.8 --> 2095.44
like

2093.76 --> 2098.2400000000002
from an outside perspective maybe the

2095.44 --> 2100.88
upside of it

2098.24 --> 2103.9199999999996
does it make me feel very

2100.88 --> 2106.56
comforted though because it's like yeah

2103.92 --> 2108.56
my world my life's just basically gone

2106.56 --> 2111.52
to [ __ ] in a way that everybody's life

2108.56 --> 2113.599
going to [ __ ] a lot earlier

2111.52 --> 2115.52
right

2113.599 --> 2117.839
yeah i'm laughing about it now but

2115.52 --> 2117.839
should i

2121.2 --> 2124.3999999999996
right

2122.64 --> 2126.96
but it's not

2124.4 --> 2126.96
look guys

2128.4 --> 2133.92
i'm basic yeah this is the weird thing

2130.56 --> 2133.92
now you know it's like

2134.24 --> 2139.1189999999997
must i

2136.48 --> 2141.599
must i be enthralled by hope even though

2139.119 --> 2143.6800000000003
i have no guarantee that it'll succeed

2141.599 --> 2145.76
because otherwise i'm just gonna play

2143.68 --> 2148.96
out is as if there is no hope and

2145.76 --> 2150.4
basically give off that bad vibe

2148.96 --> 2153.28
must i

2150.4 --> 2154.56
must i just

2153.28 --> 2156.7200000000003
be a happy

2154.56 --> 2159.119
good boy everything will be alright and

2156.72 --> 2160.9599999999996
just trust it will be and then what if

2159.119 --> 2163.119
it doesn't what if i'm gonna be told no

2160.96 --> 2164.64
no just wait a little longer right right

2163.119 --> 2167.359
familiar pattern

2164.64 --> 2168.48
can i handle that

2167.359 --> 2170.7999999999997
because

2168.48 --> 2174.079
i'm under kind of pressure

2170.8 --> 2177.04
my patience is very gradually running

2174.079 --> 2177.04
thinner and thinner

2178.16 --> 2181.359
and then what do you do

2182.48 --> 2187.839
right

2184.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
so it's like this conundrum

2191.28 --> 2197.96
which of the two problematic choices do

2194.72 --> 2197.9599999999996
i choose

2225.04 --> 2228.119
all right

2228.48 --> 2234.48
well in practice it's a little bit of

2230.56 --> 2235.92
both but it's like two opposing types of

2234.48 --> 2237.92
experience so one

2235.92 --> 2240.32
pulls me up the other one kind of pulls

2237.92 --> 2240.32
me down

2240.48 --> 2244.96
and yeah trying to keep a middle ground

2243.04 --> 2246.8
effectively

2244.96 --> 2249.119
i just thought i'd share with people

2246.8 --> 2251.44
that yeah i am dealing with this weird

2249.119 --> 2253.359
situation where my

2251.44 --> 2255.2000000000003
morality is

2253.359 --> 2256.88
getting just pushed

2255.2 --> 2258.3999999999996
and pulled

2256.88 --> 2260.96
constantly

2258.4 --> 2260.96
in ways

2265.76 --> 2271.76
and i wonder what will happen like when

2269.359 --> 2274.3199999999997
when now i'm going to look at it from

2271.76 --> 2277.119
that other perspective when it finally

2274.32 --> 2279.3590000000004
is done and i get out of this financial

2277.119 --> 2279.359
rut

2279.68 --> 2285.68
what is going to happen how will i

2283.52 --> 2287.599
change my composure

2285.68 --> 2290.24
because of it because of the energy and

2287.599 --> 2291.52
just the relief of being clamped down

2290.24 --> 2294.7599999999998
what will happen

2291.52 --> 2294.7599999999998
i wonder

2311.2 --> 2317.3199999999997
wow all right it's been ted quiet for 10

2314.32 --> 2317.32
minutes

2326.32 --> 2330.8
right but maybe you know maybe it's just

2328.88 --> 2334.88
because it's getting my birthday again

2330.8 --> 2334.88
did i was i like this last year

2338.8 --> 2344.079
in some ways

2340.64 --> 2344.0789999999997
on the other hand last year it

2344.96 --> 2349.119
the world was of course a different

2346.8 --> 2350.88
place corona announces what's going on

2349.119 --> 2354.599
but everybody was still kind of like

2350.88 --> 2354.599
yeah yeah whatever

2355.839 --> 2361.119
and now it's like really being rolled

2358.48 --> 2363.44
out on everybody so it is different so

2361.119 --> 2365.359
maybe the same pattern was occurring

2363.44 --> 2367.599
except in different circumstances now

2365.359 --> 2369.92
the pattern is reoccurring

2367.599 --> 2372.32
in a different landscape in a different

2369.92 --> 2372.32
moral

2372.4 --> 2375.04
landscape

2380.24 --> 2385.5989999999997
because i think that i get very

2382.8 --> 2387.119
introspective and dowdy about myself and

2385.599 --> 2389.599
judgey

2387.119 --> 2392.0
looking at what i've done where where i

2389.599 --> 2394.56
am at the moment versus all the other

2392.0 --> 2396.32
times in my life

2394.56 --> 2398.32
i think that happens more often when my

2396.32 --> 2401.6800000000003
birthday approaches unless i'm really

2398.32 --> 2403.3590000000004
preoccupied with something

2401.68 --> 2405.52
unless there's all kinds of subjects

2403.359 --> 2408.0789999999997
just rolling out and the energy is rich

2405.52 --> 2410.4
and hey that was last year last year

2408.079 --> 2412.0
first part was great

2410.4 --> 2415.76
remember nathan

2412.0 --> 2415.76
at the black swan and everything

2416.319 --> 2421.96
ballers were squirming

2418.96 --> 2421.96
stuttering

2430.16 --> 2436.2
oh

2431.68 --> 2436.2
got to go please share a show facebook

2441.119 --> 2445.28
yeah but is that better nathan

2443.599 --> 2448.4
is it better now

2445.28 --> 2453.5600000000004
now that they don't come

2448.4 --> 2453.56
because it was exhilarating wasn't it

2454.96 --> 2459.839
like it was good to do that is it really

2457.28 --> 2459.8390000000004
better now

2460.8 --> 2465.6800000000003
that they're like too afraid

2463.359 --> 2468.24
i mean i do appreciate the conversations

2465.68 --> 2468.24
we have

2469.839 --> 2474.92
and even being baldwin a little

2481.52 --> 2486.0
right yeah we do get newbies nathan but

2491.44 --> 2496.48
it's still not the same as like getting

2494.24 --> 2499.2799999999997
the supposed pros that are now all

2496.48 --> 2499.28
staying back

2499.44 --> 2504.56
because those were better days these

2501.119 --> 2506.48
people yeah the newbies

2504.56 --> 2508.4
are just kind of like

2506.48 --> 2509.839
they're really more victims of their

2508.4 --> 2512.48
ignorance

2509.839 --> 2515.52
and of peer pressure and circumstances

2512.48 --> 2515.52
in ways i think

2521.68 --> 2527.839
while the old guard and people like

2524.079 --> 2530.7200000000003
rumpus and george net nuke and all these

2527.839 --> 2534.7999999999997
zanic and all that

2530.72 --> 2537.2799999999997
those guys have more material

2534.8 --> 2539.2000000000003
basically to work with for us when we

2537.28 --> 2541.2000000000003
interact with them

2539.2 --> 2542.64
they have more to reflect upon so it's

2541.2 --> 2544.3999999999996
just

2542.64 --> 2547.04
more interesting and they have more

2544.4 --> 2548.4
challenging ideas

2547.04 --> 2552.0
sometimes

2548.4 --> 2552.0
or more challenging double thing

2552.07 --> 2556.48
[Music]

2554.48 --> 2557.839
all right

2556.48 --> 2561.72
all right anyway i'll see you at the

2557.839 --> 2561.72
flat earth debates nathan

2581.52 --> 2583.7599999999998
right

2584.16 --> 2590.0
they can and will come when they

2587.04 --> 2592.88
feel they can defeat us they can't

2590.0 --> 2595.119
the people who are new know it

2592.88 --> 2595.119
yeah

2597.68 --> 2600.68
correct

2637.92 --> 2641.6800000000003
so where is everybody else at

2643.359 --> 2650.24
amanda young julia pavin is still here

2647.359 --> 2650.24
george sanford

2650.56 --> 2655.72
you go play an anchor you guys still

2652.72 --> 2655.72
here

2700.16 --> 2703.16
hey

2705.599 --> 2707.92
right

2713.52 --> 2719.04
somebody's cutting down the tree i think

2716.4 --> 2721.44
somewhere

2719.04 --> 2725.079
oh wait no it's stone

2721.44 --> 2725.079
they're cutting bricks

2736.0 --> 2739.0
hmm

2789.92 --> 2794.8
most of the world is scared

2792.8 --> 2797.28
of the booger man

2794.8 --> 2800.28
because if he says

2797.28 --> 2800.28
yeah

2804.48 --> 2808.319
on the other hand you know

2806.48 --> 2811.2
it's almost like they're looking for

2808.319 --> 2812.64
actors out here and you can become part

2811.2 --> 2815.5989999999997
of the act so

2812.64 --> 2817.68
i'm literally just

2815.599 --> 2821.599
not living in that world

2817.68 --> 2821.5989999999997
like i'm i'm just ignoring it

2821.92 --> 2826.2400000000002
now when i have to

2823.76 --> 2828.4
get some cannabis or something then i

2826.24 --> 2830.7999999999997
yeah i have to wear a mask in the coffee

2828.4 --> 2832.96
shop because i don't want to get them

2830.8 --> 2835.52
into trouble

2832.96 --> 2836.64
but other than that i just ignore it i

2835.52 --> 2839.28
really just

2836.64 --> 2839.2799999999997
ignore it

2841.52 --> 2848.0
certain supermarkets

2843.68 --> 2848.0
where i usually don't go except for

2849.119 --> 2851.839
like toilet paper

2850.8 --> 2854.4
there's

2851.839 --> 2858.72
i only go there for toilet paper

2854.4 --> 2859.52
and uh what is it

2858.72 --> 2863.2
like

2859.52 --> 2865.04
dish washing brushes

2863.2 --> 2867.1189999999997
and

2865.04 --> 2869.44
like a certain type of

2867.119 --> 2871.839
yeah what is it yeah or

2869.44 --> 2873.44
non-organic licorice doesn't exist in

2871.839 --> 2875.119
organic variety

2873.44 --> 2877.599
like very old

2875.119 --> 2880.079
fashion hasn't really changed in over 40

2877.599 --> 2881.52
years something the recipe

2880.079 --> 2884.4
and i've always liked that as a little

2881.52 --> 2885.68
kid and yeah i still secretly take that

2884.4 --> 2887.92
sometimes

2885.68 --> 2889.04
so that's those are the only reasons i

2887.92 --> 2890.96
go there

2889.04 --> 2892.96
but you have to wear a mask

2890.96 --> 2895.04
or you get parents like

2892.96 --> 2897.76
people like almost like emergency

2895.04 --> 2899.599
fashion come after you like oh no

2897.76 --> 2902.3190000000004
somebody without a mask

2899.599 --> 2904.319
without a car

2902.319 --> 2907.68
it's so ridiculous now

2904.319 --> 2907.68
supermarkets are just

2909.599 --> 2912.559
ridiculous now

2912.96 --> 2916.2400000000002
and there's like traffic issues

2914.559 --> 2919.0400000000004
sometimes when it's really crowded

2916.24 --> 2920.319
literally there's just traffic issues

2919.04 --> 2922.64
like

2920.319 --> 2924.88
can't get past because people all of

2922.64 --> 2925.839
them have to have their stupid cars with

2924.88 --> 2928.319
them

2925.839 --> 2930.7999999999997
and those cars just block the aisle and

2928.319 --> 2932.16
people are not thoughtful about that at

2930.8 --> 2935.6800000000003
all

2932.16 --> 2935.68
they just leave that [ __ ] there

2937.28 --> 2940.559
and they don't

2938.4 --> 2942.7200000000003
realize like oh yeah other people with

2940.559 --> 2946.0
damn cars have to get past here too you

2942.72 --> 2947.7599999999998
know that happens all the time

2946.0 --> 2951.04
in that supermarket

2947.76 --> 2953.28
right in my supermarket the organic one

2951.04 --> 2955.119
that doesn't happen people are very

2953.28 --> 2957.6800000000003
thoughtful

2955.119 --> 2960.1600000000003
like i've really really noticed that

2957.68 --> 2960.16
difference

2960.24 --> 2968.64
like people really care

2963.839 --> 2968.64
to not obstruct others always thoughtful

2968.72 --> 2973.359
in there maybe it's the place maybe it's

2970.64 --> 2977.2
the atmosphere the places maybe it draws

2973.359 --> 2977.2
in people that are thoughtful too

2978.559 --> 2981.559
right

2988.0 --> 2992.64
and yeah i can still just not wear a

2990.64 --> 2995.68
mask in there

2992.64 --> 2997.5989999999997
and i'm like really

2995.68 --> 3000.48
euphoric about that

2997.599 --> 3002.88
like i'm really happy like i i want to

3000.48 --> 3004.64
hug some of those people sometimes

3002.88 --> 3007.2000000000003
because they just let me go to that

3004.64 --> 3009.44
supermarket without wearing a mask

3007.2 --> 3010.5589999999997
now it shouldn't be because it's my

3009.44 --> 3014.64
right

3010.559 --> 3014.6400000000003
right but yeah no it is special

3016.0 --> 3022.24
it is good i'm very happy

3018.559 --> 3023.92
and it's much better that way because

3022.24 --> 3027.1189999999997
yeah

3023.92 --> 3030.0
when i'm dealing with food i like to be

3027.119 --> 3034.0
able to breathe three free

3030.0 --> 3034.0
so i get the smell of things

3036.8 --> 3040.8
and when i have a mask on i yeah you can

3039.04 --> 3043.2
i can't smell anything

3040.8 --> 3045.599
and especially in a supermarket i

3043.2 --> 3047.52
when i really go for grocery shopping i

3045.599 --> 3049.44
tend to hang around a lot longer if i

3047.52 --> 3051.28
would wear a mask during that entire

3049.44 --> 3053.2000000000003
period that would be too long

3051.28 --> 3055.76
that would be

3053.2 --> 3058.0
like not good for me

3055.76 --> 3061.28
like i i don't

3058.0 --> 3063.68
ever really want to wear those things

3061.28 --> 3065.599
for longer than two minutes

3063.68 --> 3068.96
because then i am going to notice

3065.599 --> 3071.2000000000003
literally notice that

3068.96 --> 3071.2
right

3075.119 --> 3079.48
and that's just wearing one

3090.559 --> 3095.559
no no yeah now got lost what i'm talking

3092.559 --> 3095.559
about

3096.079 --> 3101.3590000000004
talking about masks and not being not

3098.559 --> 3101.3590000000004
wearing a mask

3101.52 --> 3105.359
are there still places where they just

3103.68 --> 3107.1189999999997
let you not wear a mask where they

3105.359 --> 3108.96
respect

3107.119 --> 3111.04
that you might have good reasons not to

3108.96 --> 3115.16
wear a mask

3111.04 --> 3115.16
just on a personal level

3159.44 --> 3163.68
hello i got my com first complaint in

3162.16 --> 3166.91
skype about

3163.68 --> 3170.16
that my chat is disabled

3166.91 --> 3172.64
[Music]

3170.16 --> 3176.7999999999997
movies got a point but i do kind of like

3172.64 --> 3178.319
that like i have absolutely no worries

3176.8 --> 3180.0
that there's going to be some kind of a

3178.319 --> 3181.52
troll

3180.0 --> 3183.28
you know i have no worries about it

3181.52 --> 3184.319
unless the troll

3183.28 --> 3186.7200000000003
is

3184.319 --> 3189.04
so persistent that he'll actually get a

3186.72 --> 3191.2799999999997
membership on my channel just to troll

3189.04 --> 3191.2799999999997
me

3192.64 --> 3197.1189999999997
hey terry 306

3194.559 --> 3197.119
good morning

3202.48 --> 3207.2400000000002
all right good evening for you i think

3208.6 --> 3211.65
[Music]

3211.92 --> 3214.92
so

3228.24 --> 3231.24
uh

3237.68 --> 3242.3199999999997
wow

3239.07 --> 3242.32
[Music]

3247.839 --> 3251.359
okay

3248.96 --> 3252.7200000000003
now the same guys like i didn't know who

3251.359 --> 3254.16
he was

3252.72 --> 3256.16
are you saying that

3254.16 --> 3258.16
it's biased

3256.16 --> 3259.839
now my show is biased because i don't

3258.16 --> 3263.04
have the uh

3259.839 --> 3264.64
non members yeah because i have to

3263.04 --> 3266.72
oh my god

3264.64 --> 3268.4
because i have a members only chat right

3266.72 --> 3272.1189999999997
now i'm biased

3268.4 --> 3272.119
isn't that just special

3279.42 --> 3282.84
[Music]

3299.359 --> 3302.88
all right well it might be biased you

3301.119 --> 3304.799
know but at least there's a guarantee

3302.88 --> 3307.6800000000003
i'm not gonna

3304.799 --> 3310.319
start cursing out of control or

3307.68 --> 3312.8799999999997
something you know

3310.319 --> 3314.799
because i i don't want to

3312.88 --> 3315.92
i would don't want that that to happen

3314.799 --> 3319.72
again

3315.92 --> 3319.7200000000003
not today at least

3331.7 --> 3341.06
[Music]

3356.88 --> 3362.88
right but uh yeah maybe i will open up

3359.839 --> 3365.599
the chat it's been now an hour

3362.88 --> 3366.96
maybe i will open it up since there is

3365.599 --> 3369.28
not much

3366.96 --> 3372.16
activity here and

3369.28 --> 3372.1600000000003
yeah i've kind of run

3372.799 --> 3378.72
general things to talk about i am open

3375.68 --> 3381.1189999999997
to questions maybe some branches in here

3378.72 --> 3382.5589999999997
and members

3381.119 --> 3386.2400000000002
are interested

3382.559 --> 3390.0400000000004
in explanations about things or

3386.24 --> 3390.04
my thoughts on things

3391.76 --> 3397.2000000000003
so yeah ask away

3394.88 --> 3399.839
if it's just gonna be

3397.2 --> 3402.319
five more minutes of silence

3399.839 --> 3406.4
then i will open up the chat

3402.319 --> 3406.4
to regular people and not just members

3413.52 --> 3417.88
i think i can alter it

3440.4 --> 3442.88
all right

3444.96 --> 3447.839
so

3449.44 --> 3454.559
have i unblocked bobby stills should i

3451.92 --> 3454.559
unblock him

3456.24 --> 3461.2799999999997
i have not unblocked anybody i blocked

3458.24 --> 3465.04
yesterday that unblocking everything was

3461.28 --> 3466.4
just a one-time thing it was mostly to

3465.04 --> 3469.44
get those

3466.4 --> 3472.079
thousand sock troll

3469.44 --> 3475.04
spammer nonsense things out of there

3472.079 --> 3479.2000000000003
because it was just i did

3475.04 --> 3479.2
was it helped to try and find somebody

3480.0 --> 3483.92
it doesn't yeah doesn't mean that i'm

3481.92 --> 3485.04
not gonna block people i i thought that

3483.92 --> 3488.88
i could

3485.04 --> 3491.119
and then i got reminded of just how

3488.88 --> 3495.2400000000002
unbelievably annoying certain

3491.119 --> 3495.2400000000002
individuals are out there

3509.05 --> 3512.139
[Music]

3520.4 --> 3528.119
right so do i got any of objections

3523.92 --> 3528.119
against opening up the chat

3552.319 --> 3555.48
all right

3566.0 --> 3568.799
hey

3567.68 --> 3572.2799999999997
granddad

3568.799 --> 3572.28
good to see you

3578.559 --> 3582.48
all right so

3579.92 --> 3586.7200000000003
bring in the tools

3582.48 --> 3589.04
spill your outrage i'm so biased bias

3586.72 --> 3589.04
chat

3597.44 --> 3600.839
so yeah

3603.599 --> 3608.04
let's see was waiting out there

3608.66 --> 3611.69
[Music]

3639.04 --> 3642.88
hey

3641.119 --> 3647.7200000000003
hello everybody out there did you know

3642.88 --> 3647.7200000000003
the earth is flat did you know

3656.88 --> 3659.119
no

3659.839 --> 3663.92
no look tara 306 look the way

3662.88 --> 3665.76
you

3663.92 --> 3667.92
and others go about

3665.76 --> 3670.4
with the trolls in the chat over at

3667.92 --> 3674.16
nathan's i don't want that in here

3670.4 --> 3676.319
i absolutely don't want that in here

3674.16 --> 3678.5589999999997
that's not what my show is meant for at

3676.319 --> 3678.5589999999997
all

3679.359 --> 3683.88
hey tiny wombo hello

3698.079 --> 3701.92
yeah

3699.28 --> 3704.2400000000002
tiny have you reconsidered getting that

3701.92 --> 3704.59
freaking corona vaccine i really hope

3704.24 --> 3707.859
you did

3704.59 --> 3707.859
[Music]

3709.2 --> 3714.5589999999997
hey

3710.319 --> 3714.5589999999997
classical homeopath hello

3716.0 --> 3720.24
tell about relative density

3717.92 --> 3723.88
disequilibrium

3720.24 --> 3723.8799999999997
okay well the disequilibrium

3726.16 --> 3732.5589999999997
is basically caused

3728.48 --> 3735.28
or rather this equilibrium is the

3732.559 --> 3738.1600000000003
the differential

3735.28 --> 3740.799
it's like how far

3738.16 --> 3742.64
is the density of the object

3740.799 --> 3745.0389999999998
removed from the density of the medium

3742.64 --> 3745.0389999999998
it is in

3745.92 --> 3751.28
right that's the disk that's density is

3748.72 --> 3754.24
equilibrium that in itself the further

3751.28 --> 3756.7200000000003
away the density from the object and the

3754.24 --> 3759.2799999999997
medium it is in

3756.72 --> 3760.799
the more distinct difference the more

3759.28 --> 3764.2400000000002
disequilibrium

3760.799 --> 3766.64
the more this equilibrium the more force

3764.24 --> 3769.52
it will be subjected to to try and find

3766.64 --> 3772.24
its equilibrium

3769.52 --> 3774.24
it's a very dense object versus a very

3772.24 --> 3777.0389999999998
not dense medium

3774.24 --> 3780.799
that will definitely be downward and the

3777.039 --> 3783.2400000000002
other way around a very not dense object

3780.799 --> 3787.2
versus a very dense medium that allows

3783.24 --> 3787.2
maneuverability it will go up

3789.44 --> 3793.839
and that's the mechanic

3791.92 --> 3795.2000000000003
it's the originator

3793.839 --> 3799.44
of a force

3795.2 --> 3799.4399999999996
the the passive displacement force

3805.76 --> 3810.48
pick something up yeah then you bring it

3808.48 --> 3811.28
out

3810.48 --> 3814.96
out

3811.28 --> 3817.2000000000003
and open into a medium

3814.96 --> 3819.359
that surrounds it right

3817.2 --> 3821.359
that is a lot less dense than it is

3819.359 --> 3823.5989999999997
whatever the object is you're picking up

3821.359 --> 3826.4
say a rock or something

3823.599 --> 3829.76
right and all that's preventing it from

3826.4 --> 3829.76
actually engaging

3830.319 --> 3836.16
in trying to find its equilibrium within

3832.48 --> 3838.96
the medium is being halted by your hand

3836.16 --> 3841.359
holding it in place

3838.96 --> 3842.88
absorbing basically that is equilibrium

3841.359 --> 3845.2
which will be experienced by you as

3842.88 --> 3845.2000000000003
weight

3845.28 --> 3849.6800000000003
presses on you because it is trying to

3847.68 --> 3853.319
find its equilibrium in the medium that

3849.68 --> 3853.319
it's surrounded with

3853.52 --> 3857.839
now the same would happen in water

3856.48 --> 3859.28
with the rock

3857.839 --> 3862.0789999999997
if you're like

3859.28 --> 3862.079
in the water

3862.319 --> 3867.44
but yeah

3864.799 --> 3870.319
it's not gonna press as hard on your

3867.44 --> 3873.2000000000003
hand in the water because yeah the the

3870.319 --> 3875.44
density this equilibrium is a lot less

3873.2 --> 3879.96
for the rock in the water it's still

3875.44 --> 3879.96
plenty enough for it to go downward

3881.28 --> 3888.2400000000002
but it's not the differential isn't as

3884.88 --> 3889.039
extreme as it is as it would be in air

3888.24 --> 3890.9599999999996
so

3889.039 --> 3893.5200000000004
there's going to be less force pushing

3890.96 --> 3895.039
it down which makes it easier for you to

3893.52 --> 3898.24
carry you could

3895.039 --> 3900.559
hold up prevent a bigger rock

3898.24 --> 3902.8799999999997
from going down with less effort in the

3900.559 --> 3902.88
water

3906.88 --> 3911.52
because the medium that surrounds it

3909.599 --> 3913.3590000000004
is a lot denser

3911.52 --> 3917.48
than the air

3913.359 --> 3917.48
see so that's the mechanic

3921.05 --> 3924.099
[Music]

3936.88 --> 3941.52
don't know what science is what

3939.359 --> 3942.72
dude don't go after jared shanford and

3941.52 --> 3945.48
he's only

3942.72 --> 3950.1189999999997
quoting people that are

3945.48 --> 3950.119
astrophysicists and all that so

3950.24 --> 3954.24
don't know why you guys are at homing in

3958.16 --> 3962.8799999999997
all right and it's not 1 12 larry mart

3961.28 --> 3965.8390000000004
you smart ass

3962.88 --> 3965.839
it's 10

3966.72 --> 3970.52
10 to the 120th

3970.88 --> 3972.88
right

3971.92 --> 3978.2000000000003
it's not

3972.88 --> 3978.2000000000003
divided 120 divided by 10.

3989.599 --> 3992.599
foreign

3994.24 --> 3998.0789999999997
you're talking about scientific notation

3996.559 --> 4001.119
i don't even know what that mean because

3998.079 --> 4001.119
science is a method

4003.039 --> 4007.92
but maybe you meant

4004.96 --> 4010.16
like how you put down

4007.92 --> 4012.079
the expression because howard moore you

4010.16 --> 4015.5989999999997
know what he was talking about you know

4012.079 --> 4017.599
it was 10 to the 120th right

4015.599 --> 4018.48
you know that

4017.599 --> 4021.6800000000003
so

4018.48 --> 4023.839
you're calling it a scientific notation

4021.68 --> 4025.2
because you assume that how you write

4023.839 --> 4027.2799999999997
things down

4025.2 --> 4030.68
is scientific

4027.28 --> 4030.6800000000003
is that it

4035.2 --> 4040.24
so you're not addressing what he

4038.0 --> 4042.799
actually said you're addressing how he

4040.24 --> 4045.9199999999996
wrote it down

4042.799 --> 4045.92
isn't that just special

4047.28 --> 4051.28
right but you did know what he meant

4049.52 --> 4053.28
right

4051.28 --> 4055.3590000000004
so instead of addressing what he

4053.28 --> 4058.3190000000004
actually said and

4055.359 --> 4061.2
yeah what that means the consequences

4058.319 --> 4063.2
instead complain about how

4061.2 --> 4064.5589999999997
he wrote it down even though you did

4063.2 --> 4067.0389999999998
know what he meant

4064.559 --> 4068.96
isn't that just fascinating how you know

4067.039 --> 4072.7990000000004
all these things that you absolutely

4068.96 --> 4075.44
don't draw logical conclusions from

4072.799 --> 4078.48
even though you know it

4075.44 --> 4078.48
isn't that just special

4081.119 --> 4085.76
it's like misspelling yes yes but you

4083.839 --> 4088.5589999999997
did know what he meant right and you're

4085.76 --> 4091.96
not addressing what he said

4088.559 --> 4091.96
howard more

4100.74 --> 4103.83
[Music]

4107.6 --> 4113.769
so

4109.649 --> 4113.769
[Music]

4137.199 --> 4141.839
okay george sanford you you spelled miss

4140.239 --> 4143.5199999999995
match there

4141.839 --> 4147.799
that's

4143.52 --> 4147.799000000001
you mad mismatch of course

4167.52 --> 4172.400000000001
that's all right george

4170.239 --> 4176.159
it's just funny that howard came in here

4172.4 --> 4178.0
especially to to tell the world in the

4176.159 --> 4179.759
chat

4178.0 --> 4181.759
that you didn't say it right that you

4179.759 --> 4183.839
didn't write it down in a correct

4181.759 --> 4188.759
fashion

4183.839 --> 4188.759
but he didn't actually address it

4190.319 --> 4194.96
he didn't address what you said even

4192.159 --> 4196.08
though he knew what you meant as you

4194.96 --> 4198.88
were

4196.08 --> 4200.88
misspelling it

4198.88 --> 4204.719
what he called you didn't

4200.88 --> 4208.36
understand scientific notation notation

4204.719 --> 4208.36
isn't that just special

4211.67 --> 4214.729
[Music]

4229.36 --> 4234.799999999999
now george of

4231.679 --> 4237.28
larry the march i don't think george

4234.8 --> 4237.28
oh wait

4242.719 --> 4246.56
1 12

4243.92 --> 4248.8
yeah but that's but he meant

4246.56 --> 4250.719
something else larry the marge

4248.8 --> 4253.04
you know that he he just wrote it down

4250.719 --> 4256.0
10 to the 120th

4253.04 --> 4257.44
now spelled it out roughly

4256.0 --> 4259.199
that's what he meant

4257.44 --> 4262.32
he was quoting something something

4259.199 --> 4262.32
michio kaku said

4264.32 --> 4268.4
and

4265.04 --> 4270.64
howard moore knew that

4268.4 --> 4273.679
because he recognized

4270.64 --> 4275.52
that it was written down wrongly

4273.679 --> 4278.32
then he complained about it instead of

4275.52 --> 4278.320000000001
addressing it

4282.239 --> 4287.04
there was a specific thing

4284.4 --> 4289.679
oh it doesn't mean

4287.04 --> 4293.04
oh so you're saying it doesn't mean what

4289.679 --> 4293.04
he said it said it means

4294.56 --> 4300.719
something specific well if something

4296.96 --> 4303.04
specific is accepted in astrophysics

4300.719 --> 4306.08
that is off

4303.04 --> 4309.76
10 to 120th

4306.08 --> 4312.08
then by accepting this very specific

4309.76 --> 4314.4800000000005
thing

4312.08 --> 4316.719
it basically embraces

4314.48 --> 4318.799999999999
that to be tolerable

4316.719 --> 4321.52
that's that's what happens when you

4318.8 --> 4325.28
accept something that is off that much i

4321.52 --> 4325.280000000001
would more that's the whole point

4326.56 --> 4331.8
seem to be uh overlooking that a little

4352.56 --> 4356.4800000000005
because effectively by accepting it you

4354.96 --> 4359.52
assimilate it

4356.48 --> 4362.639999999999
if you accept any one thing that is off

4359.52 --> 4364.2390000000005
a 10 to 120

4362.64 --> 4365.679
in the hole

4364.239 --> 4368.239
then the whole

4365.679 --> 4370.2390000000005
becomes that

4368.239 --> 4373.919999999999
takes on those standards because if it's

4370.239 --> 4373.919999999999
okay to be off that much then

4374.64 --> 4381.0
yeah anything could be okay to be off

4377.04 --> 4381.0
that much right

4397.44 --> 4401.599999999999
now howard moore the whole point is

4399.12 --> 4404.5599999999995
we're not talking about science because

4401.6 --> 4407.360000000001
cosmology and astrophysics

4404.56 --> 4409.1990000000005
astronomy is not science it's all

4407.36 --> 4412.719
observation

4409.199 --> 4416.08
calculation based

4412.719 --> 4418.64
there is no natural phenomena to

4416.08 --> 4420.239
to alter to manipulate

4418.64 --> 4423.360000000001
in order to prove anything

4420.239 --> 4425.5199999999995
scientifically in those fields

4423.36 --> 4428.719
that's why nathan oakley asks those

4425.52 --> 4432.080000000001
questions during housekeeping

4428.719 --> 4432.08
there's any scientific

4432.8 --> 4439.52
any signs

4435.04 --> 4443.8
in astrophysics cosmology and astronomy

4439.52 --> 4443.8
why he asks that every weekday

4469.36 --> 4474.28
why are you getting that from

4470.64 --> 4474.280000000001
unfortunate reality

4482.56 --> 4486.320000000001
it's this minus number

4486.4 --> 4490.5599999999995
you're talking about 10 to the minus

4489.04 --> 4492.0
something

4490.56 --> 4495.4800000000005
being inevitable where where are you

4492.0 --> 4495.48
getting this from

4534.719 --> 4542.52
oh by the way robert

4538.159 --> 4542.5199999999995
will never run rmp good to see you

4556.56 --> 4560.4800000000005
well trolls

4558.08 --> 4561.28
yeah i think there are zealots they're

4560.48 --> 4563.599999999999
like

4561.28 --> 4565.5199999999995
lower tier zealots they're like baller

4563.6 --> 4568.96
zealots that are just a really fan of

4565.52 --> 4568.96
the front lighters

4570.239 --> 4575.5199999999995
i don't know if they're really trolls

4573.12 --> 4575.5199999999995
robert

4578.32 --> 4584.0
they may have trollish actions in there

4581.52 --> 4588.6
in them in their way of going about but

4584.0 --> 4588.6
i think they're just really believing it

4594.4 --> 4599.759999999999
they're just stuck in the pre-programmed

4597.199 --> 4602.32
way of approaching things and avoiding

4599.76 --> 4604.4800000000005
things systematically to basically keep

4602.32 --> 4608.04
your conscience into a very persistent

4604.48 --> 4608.04
suspense of disbelief

4609.199 --> 4614.12
and if you get very good at those mental

4612.0 --> 4617.84
gymnastics then they kind of like

4614.12 --> 4619.5199999999995
automatically hide the truth to you

4617.84 --> 4622.2390000000005
at some point you can even lose the

4619.52 --> 4625.679
ability to undo that then you get stuck

4622.239 --> 4627.839999999999
into that suspense of disbelief

4625.679 --> 4631.36
and your psychological mechanics just

4627.84 --> 4632.96
take control of you every time you risk

4631.36 --> 4636.0
being

4632.96 --> 4638.8
pulled out of it in some way

4636.0 --> 4640.32
by accidentally assimilating the wrong

4638.8 --> 4645.159000000001
information that would break the

4640.32 --> 4645.159
suspense of disbelief for example

4649.5 --> 4653.14
[Music]

4655.56 --> 4663.77
[Music]

4666.88 --> 4671.76
yeah howard moore i don't think uh

4669.6 --> 4674.88
robert is referring to

4671.76 --> 4676.96
you in my chat i think he's referring to

4674.88 --> 4679.1990000000005
our familiarity

4676.96 --> 4681.99
with your chat activities

4679.199 --> 4686.8189999999995
in other places

4681.99 --> 4686.8189999999995
[Music]

4695.43 --> 4699.12
[Music]

4696.719 --> 4701.4
oh jesus rufus

4699.12 --> 4705.4
saint hobbins really

4701.4 --> 4705.4
reprogramming yourself

4722.08 --> 4727.04
okay larry the march

4724.32 --> 4729.759999999999
that's funny the mismatch in whatever

4727.04 --> 4731.6
george is talking about is recognized

4729.76 --> 4734.159000000001
so whatever george is talking about

4731.6 --> 4736.08
you're being now specific because you

4734.159 --> 4738.799999999999
are literally explaining an

4736.08 --> 4740.64
identification of it so you know

4738.8 --> 4742.719
whatever george was talking about

4740.64 --> 4745.76
apparently

4742.719 --> 4749.84
it's recognized and work continues to

4745.76 --> 4749.84
determine the correct number

4753.199 --> 4757.44
so

4754.0 --> 4760.159
you're trying to guess a better number

4757.44 --> 4763.5599999999995
that is less off

4760.159 --> 4763.5599999999995
is that it

4763.679 --> 4768.4800000000005
still don't know how that makes its

4765.84 --> 4771.28
science though because it's still off

4768.48 --> 4773.839999999999
there's probably a reason why it was off

4771.28 --> 4776.5599999999995
by that much first place

4773.84 --> 4779.6
now you what you're going to make it off

4776.56 --> 4779.6
slightly less

4779.76 --> 4784.320000000001
figure out some other

4781.6 --> 4787.280000000001
mathematical based

4784.32 --> 4791.719
rearrangement of the formula in order to

4787.28 --> 4791.719
make the mismatch less

4795.04 --> 4799.32
sounds like mathematical sophistry

4821.28 --> 4825.84
hmm

4823.44 --> 4829.12
okay howard moore

4825.84 --> 4831.1990000000005
well i i don't know i don't follow bev

4829.12 --> 4834.239
but if he went like that i don't know

4831.199 --> 4834.239
maybe he's just

4834.4 --> 4838.799999999999
fed up with the world in the situation

4836.639 --> 4840.56
too so he just kind of like unleashed on

4838.8 --> 4844.0
you a little or something i don't know i

4840.56 --> 4847.280000000001
wasn't there i don't know what happened

4844.0 --> 4849.92
but i think a lot of people are just

4847.28 --> 4849.92
slightly

4852.0 --> 4855.84
slightly more aggro these days

4856.32 --> 4859.679
hey

4857.36 --> 4861.92
hey daniel field thank you very much for

4859.679 --> 4864.0
the five pound super chat donation

4861.92 --> 4867.28
hey man just a little gesture

4864.0 --> 4869.44
contribution to pewd put towards a nice

4867.28 --> 4870.48
little smoke of grocery

4869.44 --> 4872.4
errands

4870.48 --> 4874.4
or whatever

4872.4 --> 4878.0
yeah thank you very much daniel field i

4874.4 --> 4878.0
really appreciate the gesture

4881.52 --> 4886.719
if possible though

4883.76 --> 4886.719
please donate to

4886.84 --> 4893.76
paypal because that will arrive

4890.56 --> 4895.52
pretty much yeah as is

4893.76 --> 4898.159000000001
very quickly

4895.52 --> 4900.639
compared to yeah super chat that leak

4898.159 --> 4903.599999999999
into uh

4900.639 --> 4908.56
the google payout of which again most is

4903.6 --> 4911.92
retracted from my social welfare so

4908.56 --> 4913.84
yeah if you really want to help me out

4911.92 --> 4915.28
because i'm pretty almost broke right

4913.84 --> 4918.400000000001
now

4915.28 --> 4920.32
please donate to paypal if it's possible

4918.4 --> 4924.0
otherwise i'll just have to figure out

4920.32 --> 4924.0
how to survive in another way

4928.32 --> 4932.5599999999995
but anyway thank you for the gesture

4933.04 --> 4937.0
and good to hear from you

4966.639 --> 4970.84
larry the march it's obvious he was

4969.76 --> 4974.719
quoting

4970.84 --> 4976.96
michokaku don't know specifically what

4974.719 --> 4977.92
he was talking about we're just quoting

4976.96 --> 4980.2390000000005
him

4977.92 --> 4981.92
so unless you want to say that michio

4980.239 --> 4983.759999999999
kakou doesn't know what he's talking

4981.92 --> 4986.4
about

4983.76 --> 4987.360000000001
pretty sure that when he used that

4986.4 --> 4989.36
number

4987.36 --> 4991.199
of offness

4989.36 --> 4994.0
he was referring to something that's

4991.199 --> 4996.239
literally going on so do we have to know

4994.0 --> 4998.08
what that specifically is larry the

4996.239 --> 5001.04
march

4998.08 --> 5006.159
are you trying to force us to

5001.04 --> 5009.44
drown in those works specifically

5006.159 --> 5012.799999999999
right is it so important to know exactly

5009.44 --> 5015.839999999999
what was off by that extreme number

5012.8 --> 5015.84
do we need to know

5016.88 --> 5020.8
clarity march is that really important

5022.32 --> 5025.92
does it change

5023.679 --> 5029.639
that it is off or are you trying to

5025.92 --> 5029.639
suggest that

5029.84 --> 5035.84
we are wrong

5031.679 --> 5035.84
when what michiokaku says is wrong

5035.92 --> 5040.76
is that what you're suggesting larry the

5037.76 --> 5040.76
march

5044.48 --> 5048.29
[Music]

5051.12 --> 5054.12
hmm

5057.84 --> 5060.84
uh

5076.48 --> 5079.5199999999995
i didn't think so

5079.679 --> 5084.84
ed george sanchez just tried to gaslight

5081.84 --> 5084.84
you

5086.159 --> 5089.879999999999
it's not gonna work

5101.04 --> 5105.44
out of context so

5102.96 --> 5108.2390000000005
seriously how is

5105.44 --> 5112.5599999999995
this statement

5108.239 --> 5117.199
something being off 10 to the 120th

5112.56 --> 5117.1990000000005
out of context larry the march

5118.0 --> 5123.199
how is that out of context

5120.48 --> 5126.159
what's the context of what

5123.199 --> 5128.48
michio kakou said that we're off with

5126.159 --> 5131.44
can you can you be more specific

5128.48 --> 5134.239
without trying to force us to

5131.44 --> 5138.48
drown in all the freaking stuff that it

5134.239 --> 5140.48
is which we don't give a [ __ ] about

5138.48 --> 5142.159
because we think it's all fake it's it's

5140.48 --> 5145.12
not science

5142.159 --> 5147.679
but maybe you could elaborate onto what

5145.12 --> 5149.04
exactly we are taking out a context

5147.679 --> 5151.04
about

5149.04 --> 5155.36
when michio kaku says

5151.04 --> 5159.0
something is off 10 to 120.

5155.36 --> 5159.0
right larry the march

5169.28 --> 5176.719
he is not even well respected in the

5172.08 --> 5178.88
field by real scientists in his field

5176.719 --> 5183.32
what is his field that contains real

5178.88 --> 5183.32
scientists exactly ares 106

5184.159 --> 5189.0
what real science are you referring to

5217.44 --> 5223.36
but what

5219.199 --> 5224.638999999999
this is libra to march really

5223.36 --> 5226.32
kaku said

5224.639 --> 5229.04
it is

5226.32 --> 5231.36
the biggest mismatch but no one seems to

5229.04 --> 5232.4
know what it is

5231.36 --> 5235.5199999999995
really

5232.4 --> 5236.879999999999
so i'm pretty sure that he's

5235.52 --> 5239.280000000001
he mentioned

5236.88 --> 5240.8
what it is

5239.28 --> 5243.92
in the thing that

5240.8 --> 5244.96
where yeah that's being quoted

5243.92 --> 5248.08
yeah

5244.96 --> 5248.08
theoretical physics

5250.0 --> 5256.32
okay every 106 well theoretical physics

5253.76 --> 5258.88
is is that science or is that

5256.32 --> 5260.239
theoretical physics

5258.88 --> 5262.639
because i think that

5260.239 --> 5263.839999999999
physics is science

5262.639 --> 5266.08
it should be

5263.84 --> 5268.2390000000005
theoretical physics i think theoretical

5266.08 --> 5271.239
physics is theory it's not really

5268.239 --> 5271.239
science

5286.32 --> 5293.799999999999
non-physical non-physical physics yeah

5288.8 --> 5293.8
excellent one unicorn laser eyes

5295.84 --> 5300.400000000001
theory is part of science now

5298.639 --> 5302.159000000001
theory

5300.4 --> 5302.96
is

5302.159 --> 5306.239
a

5302.96 --> 5308.4
yeah a scientifically confirmed

5306.239 --> 5311.678999999999
hypothesis

5308.4 --> 5311.679
that's where the theory is

5314.08 --> 5316.4
right

5319.6 --> 5325.1990000000005
if you're just

5321.679 --> 5327.28
conceptually doing stuff and not testing

5325.199 --> 5328.719
it physically

5327.28 --> 5331.92
then it's just

5328.719 --> 5334.0
it's just ideas it's just conceptions

5331.92 --> 5336.2390000000005
doesn't make it science

5334.0 --> 5338.4
just thinking about things doesn't make

5336.239 --> 5340.08
it science

5338.4 --> 5342.799999999999
it's only when you start

5340.08 --> 5344.719
literally physically testing according

5342.8 --> 5348.08
to the scientific method that something

5344.719 --> 5351.76
speak becomes science

5348.08 --> 5354.88
and when you can devise a theory based

5351.76 --> 5359.719
on the experiment on the results

5354.88 --> 5359.719
of the hypothesis test the experiment

5380.239 --> 5383.199
all right it's your birthday next week

5381.44 --> 5385.678999999999
daniel field

5383.199 --> 5389.599999999999
yeah so is mine

5385.679 --> 5389.6
or let's see it's when yeah

5389.92 --> 5393.56
yeah mine is saturday

5395.17 --> 5398.319
[Music]

5410.48 --> 5414.32
oh you're telling us larry the march

5414.8 --> 5418.320000000001
one of them is conjecture

5419.199 --> 5425.12
right so that's the colloquial theory

5423.76 --> 5427.360000000001
right

5425.12 --> 5429.199
when we are specifically talking about

5427.36 --> 5432.799999999999
science

5429.199 --> 5436.48
now that one should not be drawn in and

5432.8 --> 5438.320000000001
misidentified as a theory

5436.48 --> 5441.718999999999
within science then

5438.32 --> 5441.719
keep it apart

5449.679 --> 5452.96
right what tiny wumble thank you for

5451.679 --> 5454.719
that

5452.96 --> 5456.96
it's why i

5454.719 --> 5458.08
attempt

5456.96 --> 5460.2390000000005
to just

5458.08 --> 5462.5599999999995
when people talk about theories

5460.239 --> 5465.12
colloquial theories i try to

5462.56 --> 5466.4800000000005
change the word into concepts

5465.12 --> 5469.48
conceptions

5466.48 --> 5469.48
ideas

5485.12 --> 5488.159
it has been a tough journey by the way

5487.28 --> 5490.719
to

5488.159 --> 5493.199
to alter that to actually do that it

5490.719 --> 5495.28
took me because before quantum eraser

5493.199 --> 5497.919999999999
got on the flat earth debates i was

5495.28 --> 5500.4
doing that all the time

5497.92 --> 5503.04
i didn't know about science uh what the

5500.4 --> 5505.679
the the nitty gritty details the

5503.04 --> 5507.5199999999995
semantics

5505.679 --> 5510.0
what is actually

5507.52 --> 5513.120000000001
really at the bottom at the start of it

5510.0 --> 5513.12
all what's real

5514.0 --> 5517.36
and that yeah people have just been

5516.0 --> 5520.719
fooled into

5517.36 --> 5520.719
using words and

5521.76 --> 5527.76
kind of as a an authority tool

5525.44 --> 5530.0
seeming very intellectual

5527.76 --> 5532.56
and that and it's it's just an act

5530.0 --> 5535.28
really they don't they might not even be

5532.56 --> 5536.4800000000005
realizing it themselves

5535.28 --> 5539.04
they're just

5536.48 --> 5541.5199999999995
mimicking

5539.04 --> 5543.36
science it's not actually science it's

5541.52 --> 5547.6
just a bunch of ideas about just

5543.36 --> 5550.159
concepts because there's no viable

5547.6 --> 5552.639
validated hypothesis

5550.159 --> 5554.879999999999
as part of that theory so it's not

5552.639 --> 5559.4800000000005
really a theory

5554.88 --> 5559.4800000000005
it's just an idea it's just a concept

5588.8 --> 5593.320000000001
right yeah tiny wumbos getting it right

5618.8 --> 5623.28
yeah as a musician indeed you don't have

5621.84 --> 5625.84
the authority

5623.28 --> 5628.48
to speak about science especially since

5625.84 --> 5632.4800000000005
you misunderstand what science is

5628.48 --> 5634.959999999999
i think because you think colloquial

5632.48 --> 5638.638999999999
science is science it's not

5634.96 --> 5641.44
it's a cultural ruse

5638.639 --> 5642.32
it is a ruse it's not real it's it's an

5641.44 --> 5644.239
act

5642.32 --> 5645.04
it's a cultural

5644.239 --> 5648.159
yeah

5645.04 --> 5648.159
science act

5648.719 --> 5651.92
it's a cultural thing

5654.96 --> 5659.04
even though it's not even identified as

5657.04 --> 5660.719
such it's claimed it's acclaimed

5659.04 --> 5662.639
authority

5660.719 --> 5664.8
act

5662.639 --> 5666.719
because it's not really science

5664.8 --> 5668.719
but people are yeah being made to

5666.719 --> 5670.4
believe is science they just

5668.719 --> 5673.52
are taught now

5670.4 --> 5675.92
through media a lot and just general

5673.52 --> 5675.92
culture

5678.159 --> 5683.839999999999
no doubt nasa influences all that

5682.48 --> 5686.159
that just

5683.84 --> 5689.6
testing things

5686.159 --> 5693.199
and logic logical reasoning

5689.6 --> 5696.159000000001
that that per definition is science

5693.199 --> 5698.32
that's the original rules that's

5696.159 --> 5700.719
the conviction that people have been

5698.32 --> 5702.32
convinced of

5700.719 --> 5705.04
don't know why my camera is getting so

5702.32 --> 5706.799999999999
freaking blurry now

5705.04 --> 5709.8
stop it

5706.8 --> 5709.8
right

5716.45 --> 5719.599999999999
[Music]

5727.199 --> 5729.839999999999
right

5731.52 --> 5738.159000000001
but the thing is people don't say

5733.44 --> 5738.159
colloquial theory they just say theory

5738.96 --> 5743.52
it shouldn't be called that because

5741.199 --> 5744.32
people don't realize

5743.52 --> 5746.96
that

5744.32 --> 5749.199
some people out there

5746.96 --> 5751.199
claim science and they're not actually

5749.199 --> 5754.32
talking about science

5751.199 --> 5757.04
yeah yeah yeah we know technically

5754.32 --> 5758.159
it is colloquial but most people don't

5757.04 --> 5760.48
know that

5758.159 --> 5763.119
and they'll just take it as if it were

5760.48 --> 5767.36
science because they don't know

5763.119 --> 5767.36
that it's completely different category

5769.84 --> 5775.6
and it's it's set up

5773.92 --> 5777.36
culturally

5775.6 --> 5780.4800000000005
as a scam

5777.36 --> 5783.119
as a science scam opportunity that's how

5780.48 --> 5784.638999999999
it's set up that's how it's being taught

5783.119 --> 5787.44
for people

5784.639 --> 5789.84
to very easily be fooled

5787.44 --> 5792.799999999999
and that people claiming science are not

5789.84 --> 5795.84
actually scientists

5792.8 --> 5799.2390000000005
just fooling around and pretending

5795.84 --> 5799.2390000000005
to be scientists

5812.239 --> 5818.33
all right

5815.24 --> 5818.33
[Music]

5825.59 --> 5833.27
[Music]

5851.119 --> 5855.119
oh

5852.84 --> 5857.1990000000005
really if you don't believe in

5855.119 --> 5862.0
heliocentric theory

5857.199 --> 5864.799999999999
come up with evidence what evidence

5862.0 --> 5864.8
what does that mean

5866.48 --> 5871.36
why do we have to come up with evidence

5868.719 --> 5874.4
against heliocentric theory when you

5871.36 --> 5876.96
have no evidence for it that is

5874.4 --> 5878.719
legitimate

5876.96 --> 5880.719
it's all been debunked why would we need

5878.719 --> 5883.36
to come up with evidence

5880.719 --> 5884.08
to the contrary

5883.36 --> 5886.799999999999
and

5884.08 --> 5891.36
publish in a rapid bullet journal really

5886.8 --> 5892.88
so what reputable journal would publish

5891.36 --> 5894.0
something

5892.88 --> 5895.92
that would go

5894.0 --> 5899.28
just straight forward against

5895.92 --> 5899.28
heliocentric theory

5900.239 --> 5905.678999999999
can you do you have an example of a a

5903.36 --> 5907.599999999999
reputable journal that would do that

5905.679 --> 5909.6
larry the march or is that just an

5907.6 --> 5911.6
oxymoron and you're just saying like no

5909.6 --> 5915.280000000001
you have to do this because it is

5911.6 --> 5915.280000000001
impossible they would never do it

5915.84 --> 5920.52
is that what you're doing right now

5917.119 --> 5920.5199999999995
larry the march

5934.0 --> 5938.159
yeah

5935.52 --> 5940.400000000001
no unfortunate reality now the blacks

5938.159 --> 5945.04
one is not debunked you obviously don't

5940.4 --> 5945.04
know what the black swan argument is

5945.28 --> 5950.719
right you don't understand because

5947.119 --> 5950.719
otherwise you wouldn't be saying this

5951.04 --> 5955.04
you don't understand the black swan

5952.639 --> 5956.400000000001
argument the black zone argument

5955.04 --> 5958.88
is

5956.4 --> 5962.08
that the earth cannot be the proclaimed

5958.88 --> 5964.96
geometric globe because we can see too

5962.08 --> 5967.44
far at too low observer height and no

5964.96 --> 5969.92
amounts of fictional

5967.44 --> 5972.638999999999
optical effects

5969.92 --> 5974.719
like terrestrial refraction can fix this

5972.639 --> 5978.400000000001
because directional refraction is

5974.719 --> 5981.199
science fiction the horizon can never

5978.4 --> 5983.5199999999995
visually displaced in relation to the

5981.199 --> 5986.5599999999995
horizon that's a physical

5983.52 --> 5990.0
impossibility that cannot be done it's

5986.56 --> 5990.0
impossible to do that

5993.52 --> 5998.96
right ignore refraction the science

5996.0 --> 6002.0
fiction terrestrial refraction that's a

5998.96 --> 6004.4
physical impossibility the horizon can

6002.0 --> 6006.0
never displace in relation to the

6004.4 --> 6008.4
horizon

6006.0 --> 6010.92
optically impossible

6008.4 --> 6013.92
that does not happen it's an optical

6010.92 --> 6016.88
impossibility look into optics you will

6013.92 --> 6019.84
not find any

6016.88 --> 6022.8
refraction explanation

6019.84 --> 6026.719
or study that will show you how the

6022.8 --> 6029.84
horizon displaces in relation to the

6026.719 --> 6034.08
actual horizon the geometry of what is

6029.84 --> 6038.2390000000005
being observed it's impossible

6034.08 --> 6038.239
there is no such optical effect

6039.119 --> 6042.759999999999
it's science fiction

6054.88 --> 6059.6
terrestrial refraction

6056.8 --> 6062.0
is a mathematical paradox that assumes

6059.6 --> 6064.8
the radius

6062.0 --> 6066.239
within the formula as it tries to prove

6064.8 --> 6069.119000000001
the radius

6066.239 --> 6071.36
right because it has to

6069.119 --> 6074.08
be like that or the earth wouldn't be a

6071.36 --> 6076.639
ball right or it actually

6074.08 --> 6079.04
just uses the radius

6076.639 --> 6080.56
within the formula to prove

6079.04 --> 6082.4
the radius

6080.56 --> 6084.96
right that's a paradox it's a

6082.4 --> 6086.4
mathematical paradox

6084.96 --> 6089.6
besides

6086.4 --> 6092.159
the effects that the horizon can never

6089.6 --> 6093.4400000000005
be visually displaced in relation to the

6092.159 --> 6095.839999999999
horizons

6093.44 --> 6097.28
in any optic situation

6095.84 --> 6100.639
right

6097.28 --> 6103.599999999999
so i'm very sorry to break that to you

6100.639 --> 6104.84
earth is not a globe the black swan is

6103.6 --> 6106.719
not

6104.84 --> 6109.84
debunked

6106.719 --> 6113.52
the arguments against it

6109.84 --> 6115.28
are science fiction conjurations

6113.52 --> 6116.719
they're not things that can actually

6115.28 --> 6120.32
happen

6116.719 --> 6122.32
as described those effects do not exist

6120.32 --> 6124.639
in physical reality cannot be

6122.32 --> 6127.04
demonstrated

6124.639 --> 6133.159000000001
this is science fiction you're relying

6127.04 --> 6133.159
on to debunk the black swan you can't

6135.18 --> 6139.359
[Music]

6142.99 --> 6149.46
[Music]

6154.96 --> 6162.28
in front of both oil rigs well it's very

6157.44 --> 6162.28
simple the conditions are different

6163.92 --> 6168.08
so yeah the thing is though

6166.4 --> 6170.638999999999
if the earth was

6168.08 --> 6172.639
an actual sphere

6170.639 --> 6175.1990000000005
that could never happen

6172.639 --> 6177.28
there is no optical effect

6175.199 --> 6181.599999999999
that allows you

6177.28 --> 6185.36
to look behind a geometrical curve

6181.6 --> 6188.400000000001
there is no optical effect

6185.36 --> 6189.199
in the natural world

6188.4 --> 6191.36
right

6189.199 --> 6193.599999999999
in natural conditions

6191.36 --> 6196.88
like even with heat and

6193.6 --> 6197.76
moist in the air that could make you

6196.88 --> 6202.159000000001
see

6197.76 --> 6204.56
behind a curve that's a physical optics

6202.159 --> 6207.759999999999
based impossibility

6204.56 --> 6209.4400000000005
it's not possible that form of looming

6207.76 --> 6211.4400000000005
does not exist

6209.44 --> 6215.36
what looming does

6211.44 --> 6218.4
is take something that is visible

6215.36 --> 6221.36
in relation to

6218.4 --> 6225.5199999999995
the horizon

6221.36 --> 6229.04
and displaces it in relation to the

6225.52 --> 6234.080000000001
horizon the horizon itself

6229.04 --> 6238.159
is not part of the displacement in any

6234.08 --> 6241.639
optics refraction based effects

6238.159 --> 6241.638999999999
doesn't exist

6243.78 --> 6246.84
[Music]

6265.52 --> 6269.679
no

6267.36 --> 6272.4
horizon doesn't move

6269.679 --> 6276.88
because of refraction

6272.4 --> 6280.159
horizon visibility point just shifts

6276.88 --> 6282.21
back and forth how far you can see

6280.159 --> 6283.36
before things are cut off

6282.21 --> 6285.84
[Music]

6283.36 --> 6287.759999999999
shifts back and forth slightly due to

6285.84 --> 6292.08
refraction

6287.76 --> 6292.08
the horizon itself does not

6292.32 --> 6295.679
go down

6293.36 --> 6298.159
you never look downward

6295.679 --> 6301.52
you always look straight into the

6298.159 --> 6304.48
distance always always

6301.52 --> 6306.4800000000005
what you see there may look like oh look

6304.48 --> 6308.959999999999
there's this thing that's cut off now

6306.48 --> 6311.119
i'm going to imagine that from that

6308.96 --> 6312.8
super straight point on suddenly it

6311.119 --> 6314.799999999999
starts curving and that's why we can't

6312.8 --> 6316.4800000000005
see anymore no

6314.8 --> 6318.96
that's not the case

6316.48 --> 6322.4
it's just that beyond that you just

6318.96 --> 6324.4800000000005
can't see anything cohesive anymore

6322.4 --> 6328.08
because of probably conditions in the

6324.48 --> 6328.959999999999
air like more moist the closer this will

6328.08 --> 6331.84
get

6328.96 --> 6333.92
right but the horizon

6331.84 --> 6337.679
is not

6333.92 --> 6340.56
displacing vertically it's displacing

6337.679 --> 6343.84
horizontally because it's an optical

6340.56 --> 6346.0
effect that displaces over the flat

6343.84 --> 6348.08
surface you're looking over

6346.0 --> 6351.04
right it displaces

6348.08 --> 6354.5599999999995
because of the conditions in the air

6351.04 --> 6357.199
horizontally not vertically

6354.56 --> 6360.719
miraging effects

6357.199 --> 6362.5599999999995
refraction based effects don't displace

6360.719 --> 6365.119
the horizon

6362.56 --> 6370.2390000000005
it just displaces things

6365.119 --> 6370.239
visible in relation to the horizon

6370.48 --> 6374.5599999999995
now how far you can see the horizon the

6372.88 --> 6376.400000000001
optical effect

6374.56 --> 6380.639
yeah that can alter

6376.4 --> 6383.96
doesn't change it vertically though

6380.639 --> 6383.96
it's impossible

6391.92 --> 6396.08
and that's what i mean with the horizon

6393.76 --> 6398.56
can never displace in relation to the

6396.08 --> 6398.5599999999995
horizon

6399.04 --> 6402.96
or the actual geometric horizon that's

6401.36 --> 6403.679
not possible

6402.96 --> 6405.679
but

6403.679 --> 6408.88
it can

6405.679 --> 6410.8
shift closer and further away

6408.88 --> 6412.639
depending on the conditions of how far

6410.8 --> 6415.04
you can see so it's like

6412.639 --> 6417.84
how far can you see this flat surface

6415.04 --> 6422.159
can you see it up until here up until

6417.84 --> 6422.159000000001
there up until there up until there

6424.159 --> 6430.08
but you never see oh the horizon is over

6426.639 --> 6431.92
here today it's it's it's down there

6430.08 --> 6434.8
or it's up there no

6431.92 --> 6437.76
it's only objects

6434.8 --> 6440.639
visible in relation to the horizon that

6437.76 --> 6440.639
might displace

6440.88 --> 6445.4400000000005
the horizon itself does not vertically

6444.32 --> 6447.04
alter

6445.44 --> 6450.5599999999995
visually

6447.04 --> 6452.08
it's only how far you can see

6450.56 --> 6454.2390000000005
right and how far you can see is

6452.08 --> 6456.8
obviously involved in perspective and

6454.239 --> 6458.239
because of perspective further away

6456.8 --> 6461.92
things go

6458.239 --> 6464.879999999999
the seemingly in relation to your entire

6461.92 --> 6466.8
fuel higher up it goes right it's not

6464.88 --> 6469.28
actually going higher up it's just

6466.8 --> 6470.8
further away new to perspective that

6469.28 --> 6473.679
means it will

6470.8 --> 6476.96
seem to go up in the entire view

6473.679 --> 6476.96
getting closer to

6477.04 --> 6481.28
the middle point of the view

6479.44 --> 6485.48
in the distance because it's flat you're

6481.28 --> 6485.48
looking over something that's flat

6499.44 --> 6502.638999999999
four foot swells

6504.239 --> 6508.799999999999
yeah but that's not really the horizon

6506.56 --> 6511.6
though that's literally something in

6508.8 --> 6512.400000000001
relation to the horizon like a bulge of

6511.6 --> 6515.119000000001
water

6512.4 --> 6517.44
that's sticking out due to like a tide

6515.119 --> 6519.839999999999
happening

6517.44 --> 6524.32
and it sticks out a little in relation

6519.84 --> 6528.639
to the horizon the actual visual horizon

6524.32 --> 6528.639
does not alter vertically

6533.119 --> 6539.36
because the horizon is just an apparent

6536.56 --> 6541.84
visual thing it's where the sky seems to

6539.36 --> 6541.839999999999
meet the ground

6542.639 --> 6548.32
and if you can't see as far then it will

6545.76 --> 6552.08
appear like the cutoff point the optical

6548.32 --> 6552.08
slant effect will be closer by

6552.4 --> 6556.719
it's not actually though it's just

6554.56 --> 6559.76
that's how far you can see and anything

6556.719 --> 6561.28
beyond it will be

6559.76 --> 6565.4400000000005
drowned out

6561.28 --> 6565.44
because of optical deviation

6565.599 --> 6569.679
will be blurred up

6567.52 --> 6573.4400000000005
you won't see anything beyond that even

6569.679 --> 6575.28
though there is things beyond it

6573.44 --> 6577.28
it's just you can't see that far at that

6575.28 --> 6578.8
point because of that where the weather

6577.28 --> 6580.639
conditions

6578.8 --> 6582.96
does not however there's no weather

6580.639 --> 6584.88
conditions that'll literally just make

6582.96 --> 6587.44
the entire

6584.88 --> 6590.32
surface you're looking over seem to

6587.44 --> 6591.44
completely like go down like

6590.32 --> 6592.5599999999995
several

6591.44 --> 6597.32
degrees

6592.56 --> 6597.320000000001
that's never happened ever

6599.28 --> 6603.28
that that sort of thing only really

6601.119 --> 6605.36
happens when you're looking through an

6603.28 --> 6607.36
entirely different medium

6605.36 --> 6610.88
like you're looking through an aquarium

6607.36 --> 6613.679
with water then like significant

6610.88 --> 6616.96
visual alterations do happen

6613.679 --> 6621.52
but yeah that's an a dramatic medium

6616.96 --> 6623.119
change with sizable refraction index

6621.52 --> 6625.360000000001
right

6623.119 --> 6626.799999999999
that's not the general condition of the

6625.36 --> 6628.5599999999995
air we're looking through because we're

6626.8 --> 6630.96
always going to be looking through air

6628.56 --> 6630.96
out there

6631.679 --> 6635.599
you're never going to literally look

6633.679 --> 6636.96
through a body of water in order to

6635.599 --> 6639.04
establish

6636.96 --> 6641.92
such visual

6639.04 --> 6641.92
alterations

6643.119 --> 6650.36
because it's always going to be air

6645.679 --> 6650.36
in water you can't even see that far

6657.14 --> 6660.27
[Music]

6672.96 --> 6679.36
all right yes don't monkey 3d sure

6676.239 --> 6682.159
and so did ranty ranty did some research

6679.36 --> 6686.4
on that he called it the tidal bulge

6682.159 --> 6686.4
because water does in its entirety

6686.8 --> 6692.88
yeah this place even vertically

6690.239 --> 6695.199
because of yeah water just pushing up

6692.88 --> 6697.599
pushing up the land

6695.199 --> 6698.719
because of tides and all that right so

6697.599 --> 6702.56
there is

6698.719 --> 6704.719
actual material displacing in relation

6702.56 --> 6708.0
to the horizon and it might even

6704.719 --> 6710.4800000000005
obstruct things

6708.0 --> 6712.32
that's not the bulge of a geometry

6710.48 --> 6716.32
though

6712.32 --> 6720.28
it's something physically obstructing

6716.32 --> 6720.28
what may be seen beyond

6724.719 --> 6729.44
and it's proven that there's literally a

6726.96 --> 6732.719
body of water on a local location

6729.44 --> 6737.48
sticking out slightly

6732.719 --> 6737.4800000000005
it's not due to earth curvature

6741.679 --> 6747.4400000000005
right i'm gonna round out the show

6744.719 --> 6748.96
so yeah i managed to hold it together

6747.44 --> 6750.719
today

6748.96 --> 6754.8
not get all aggressive i thought it was

6750.719 --> 6754.8
a pretty good show and i yeah i like

6755.84 --> 6760.4800000000005
that i open up the chat again it's been

6757.679 --> 6763.36
good even with some ballers in there

6760.48 --> 6765.759999999999
that are kind of zealots

6763.36 --> 6769.5199999999995
but i think today was a good show

6765.76 --> 6769.52
so thanks everyone for coming

6772.08 --> 6776.96
if you like the show then please don't

6774.639 --> 6778.719

right

6814.239 --> 6818.4
i will be back tomorrow with flat earth

6816.0 --> 6819.76
early bird number 797

6818.4 --> 6821.759999999999
and i'm gonna join the flat earth

6819.76 --> 6824.0
debates which should start up any minute

6821.76 --> 6824.0
now

6824.96 --> 6829.119
so yeah thanks everybody for being in

6826.88 --> 6834.679
chat and being part of the show

6829.119 --> 6834.679
and until the next video keep it flat
