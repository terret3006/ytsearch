remarkable it's

really hot i'm

82.24 --> 89.91999999999999
in a short pants again because it's like

85.6 --> 90.32
really hot i don't know what that guy is

89.92 --> 92.07900000000001
thinking

90.32 --> 95.19999999999999
[Music]

92.079 --> 96.63999999999999
although yeah it might be getting back

95.2 --> 98.32000000000001
very late and it's probably

96.64 --> 100.64
the evening's probably still going to be

98.32 --> 103.439
pretty chilly

100.64 --> 105.119
not fresh i keep saying fresh it's weird

103.439 --> 107.27999999999999
because that's a

105.119 --> 109.68
that's like a literal translation from a

107.28 --> 111.2
dutch saying that's not used in english

109.68 --> 111.84
it's weird so i keep calling it fresh

111.2 --> 115.60000000000001
but it's

111.84 --> 118.07900000000001
like chili but to me chili

115.6 --> 119.119
is pretty hot because that's like the

118.079 --> 123.439
red

119.119 --> 128.08
pepper thing so i don't know

123.439 --> 129.92
but right now it's like cooking

128.08 --> 131.92000000000002
on the roof you you got to stand in the

129.92 --> 135.51999999999998
shadow because it's really hot so yeah

131.92 --> 138.0
nice hot day there were some yeah some

135.52 --> 138.0
trails

138.319 --> 144.72
but they seem to have yeah

141.68 --> 147.44
wavered in all directions

144.72 --> 148.239
so yeah you can't really see it but yeah

147.44 --> 150.56
there is like

148.239 --> 153.28
it's not perfect blue so it's a little

150.56 --> 153.28
bit hazy

154.72 --> 160.239
but there's no clouds anywhere and it's

156.48 --> 160.23899999999998
just hot the sun is really hot

160.48 --> 163.92
nice after summer day

169.519 --> 174.31900000000002
right let's use in chat so far

175.28 --> 178.879
ah amanda young's first

179.12 --> 186.31
rob h good servant

184.48 --> 187.51899999999998
yeah good to see you

186.31 --> 190.239
[Music]

187.519 --> 191.04
same weather in germany 23 degrees

190.239 --> 192.48000000000002
celsius

191.04 --> 194.07999999999998
i don't know what the temperature is

192.48 --> 198.07999999999998
exactly

194.08 --> 202.64000000000001
let me check it

198.08 --> 202.64000000000001
it's 27 degrees over here right now

211.76 --> 216.0
all hmm so it's a little bit warmer over

213.84 --> 216.0
here

218.239 --> 221.44
but yeah i don't know how long it'll

219.68 --> 223.36
last you know

221.44 --> 225.2
in this period things can shift around

223.36 --> 226.87900000000002
pretty quick so it started out pretty

225.2 --> 228.39999999999998
sunny and then all of a sudden it gets

226.879 --> 231.2
really clouded

228.4 --> 232.31900000000002
you never really know or maybe the

231.2 --> 235.11999999999998
weather

232.319 --> 237.04
predictors know i just don't know for

235.12 --> 240.799
sure but i know that it

237.04 --> 243.12
switches around a lot typically now

240.799 --> 243.12
right

247.12 --> 254.159
yeah yesterday was

250.239 --> 257.04
quite something

254.159 --> 258.239
and i got some trolls trying to call me

257.04 --> 261.68
nazi and all that

258.239 --> 264.71999999999997
indirectly and all yeah

261.68 --> 264.72
to be expected

267.199 --> 274.08000000000004
i get i did get kind of rough and i did

270.639 --> 274.08
double down on it as well

274.88 --> 279.199
but yeah things are so convoluted

279.68 --> 283.68
and at the same time i didn't even

281.199 --> 285.04
mention it yet trump seems to be like

283.68 --> 286.72
forwarding yeah we're gonna get the

285.04 --> 288.8
vaccines and the military is gonna

286.72 --> 291.91900000000004
distribute it and just like

288.8 --> 295.12
no no that's not

291.919 --> 296.96
what we need like really we don't so

295.12 --> 300.479
yeah you almost start to think like is

296.96 --> 300.479
this some kind of cover story

300.8 --> 305.28000000000003
like they're gonna do something about it

302.4 --> 307.35999999999996
but they can't say it directly because

305.28 --> 307.35999999999996
of

308.84 --> 312.96
something because he's afraid it'll go

312.639 --> 315.52
yeah

312.96 --> 316.88
that other countries will start to see

315.52 --> 321.19899999999996
him like hitler

316.88 --> 323.68
which is just at this point man

321.199 --> 325.28000000000003
and at the same time they're still just

323.68 --> 328.56
burning down the whole

325.28 --> 339.84
west coast in the united states saw some

328.56 --> 339.84
new articles about it natural news

341.199 --> 345.91900000000004
yeah i did just i i don't get it

349.68 --> 353.36
like these types of things are pretty

351.6 --> 355.759
urgent you know you can't just

353.36 --> 356.96000000000004
wait until after election to do

355.759 --> 360.47900000000004
something

356.96 --> 363.59999999999997
it just seems completely ridiculous it's

360.479 --> 366.0
it's gonna poison the well it

363.6 --> 368.08000000000004
literally you know it's like keeping

366.0 --> 369.759
something like this going

368.08 --> 371.28
with everything that's already out about

369.759 --> 374.639
it it's it's literally

371.28 --> 376.71999999999997
just going to aggravate it's

374.639 --> 378.24
it's like a bunch of oil drums were

376.72 --> 380.319
dumped in a lake

378.24 --> 382.8
and they're leaking yeah the longer you

380.319 --> 384.40000000000003
leave it the worse it's going to get

382.8 --> 386.56
and in this case it's going to spread

384.4 --> 388.15999999999997
pretty quickly since it's a fire

386.56 --> 390.4
it's going to spread like fire so it's

388.16 --> 390.40000000000003
just

392.84 --> 399.35999999999996
like i would try to give a pretty

395.84 --> 402.4
decisive response

399.36 --> 402.88
like it is an emergency literally as a

402.4 --> 405.19899999999996
terror

402.88 --> 406.8
you could classify this as a terrorist

405.199 --> 409.599
attack

406.8 --> 409.91900000000004
and nobody in the world could judicially

409.599 --> 411.44
do

409.919 --> 413.19899999999996
something about that because it's

411.44 --> 423.84
correct so

413.199 --> 423.84000000000003
inaction is just

430.88 --> 437.039
right but at least yeah

434.88 --> 438.15999999999997
mike adams is getting more fired up at

437.039 --> 441.36
natural news

438.16 --> 443.28000000000003
about it as well basically starting to

441.36 --> 445.28000000000003
suggest like yeah maybe

443.28 --> 447.11999999999995
it is up to the public because it's just

445.28 --> 450.479
no action against it

447.12 --> 453.919
roughly that message and

450.479 --> 458.4
yeah i i agree but

453.919 --> 460.79999999999995
still i don't know man

458.4 --> 464.4
i'm just staring it from way over here

460.8 --> 464.40000000000003
across the atlantic and i'm just

468.479 --> 481.84
it's such a bummer to me the whole thing

479.52 --> 484.24
some things are beyond human control oh

481.84 --> 484.23999999999995
really

488.879 --> 494.639
you think that this these situations

492.24 --> 495.68
fall under that you think that's beyond

494.639 --> 500.56
human control

495.68 --> 502.72
really there's literally fires being

500.56 --> 502.72
lit

503.599 --> 508.319
and it's continuing

506.879 --> 521.44
and there's nothing that you could do

508.319 --> 524.609
about it really

521.44 --> 524.609
[Music]

529.04 --> 535.8389999999999
i don't know man i could think of so

531.44 --> 535.839
many things that could be done

536.399 --> 540.24
especially with the technology now

543.04 --> 546.959
so yeah as apparently now drones are

545.76 --> 549.68
being used to just

546.959 --> 551.4399999999999
start fires and that seems like okay

549.68 --> 553.4399999999999
that could be efficient you know for a

551.44 --> 554.9590000000001
proper functioning fire department and

553.44 --> 558.9590000000001
all that

554.959 --> 561.1199999999999
it's also extremely prone to quick abuse

558.959 --> 562.3199999999999
now these people that are doing this

561.12 --> 565.519
they need to be

562.32 --> 566.6400000000001
tracked they need to be traced tracked

565.519 --> 570.32
identified

566.64 --> 573.8389999999999
and then just swat

570.32 --> 577.519
quickly all of them

573.839 --> 580.1600000000001
because they're just insane

577.519 --> 581.36
and they're totally literally attacking

580.16 --> 584.0
the country

581.36 --> 585.04
yeah the wild that's terrible that that

584.0 --> 586.8
happens

585.04 --> 588.88
you know and yeah governments typically

586.8 --> 591.12
kind of ignore it don't really care that

588.88 --> 592.48
much the public it hurts and it's not

591.12 --> 592.9590000000001
good for the air and all that and all

592.48 --> 595.839
that

592.959 --> 596.959
but yeah but at the same time it's also

595.839 --> 602.0790000000001
yeah

596.959 --> 606.2399999999999
houses are also burning down so this is

602.079 --> 608.4799999999999
they need to be stopped really quickly

606.24 --> 611.44
and how do you do that like are they

608.48 --> 613.279
already all identified

611.44 --> 616.0
if they're not they should be as quick

613.279 --> 616.0
as possible

617.36 --> 621.76
i i don't know man it sounds so bad to

620.48 --> 625.6800000000001
think about it but

621.76 --> 630.48
i almost say like okay just put out

625.68 --> 630.4799999999999
a hundred thousands small drones

630.64 --> 638.16
with cameras on there and just

634.16 --> 640.56
start swarming the entire california

638.16 --> 641.76
to and just keep freaking track of

640.56 --> 645.1999999999999
people in the woods

641.76 --> 647.2
it sounds terrible i know but like

645.2 --> 648.72
that would be potentially a quick

647.2 --> 651.0400000000001
solution

648.72 --> 652.8000000000001
to yeah to get the people that are just

651.04 --> 654.7199999999999
off the sk that are off the map that

652.8 --> 658.24
nobody knows about that are also

654.72 --> 660.5600000000001
doing this to catch them in the act

658.24 --> 663.839
quickly and locate them and just

660.56 --> 665.1999999999999
send in a helicopter drop in the swat

663.839 --> 668.32
and just

665.2 --> 670.24
quick you know i don't know

668.32 --> 675.519
maybe i've been playing too much

670.24 --> 677.76
computer games and [ __ ]

675.519 --> 679.76
i know that air dropping like inside a

677.76 --> 682.64
fire zone isn't exactly

679.76 --> 683.76
safe but that's why the drone should be

682.64 --> 685.6
swarming around

683.76 --> 687.36
seeing it as it's happening and then as

685.6 --> 688.16
it's happening it's not gonna grow out

687.36 --> 690.72
control

688.16 --> 692.7199999999999
super quick that takes some time for

690.72 --> 694.5600000000001
things get hot enough to really start

692.72 --> 696.24
creating massive smoke and [ __ ]

694.56 --> 698.959
and then it becomes dangerous for

696.24 --> 701.839
helicopters if they're spotted quickly

698.959 --> 702.56
you could just like send a helicopter

701.839 --> 705.519
straight away

702.56 --> 707.279
10 minutes 50 minutes i don't know it's

705.519 --> 709.76
california there should be plenty of

707.279 --> 709.76
places

710.24 --> 717.839
from which to approach it i don't know

714.839 --> 717.839
man

726.12 --> 729.24
[Music]

742.839 --> 745.839
so

747.44 --> 759.6800000000001
really they're causing fires over mccoy

751.2 --> 762.8000000000001
oh god

759.68 --> 764.959
that must be some drunk freaking maniacs

762.8 --> 766.0
you know you have those especially when

764.959 --> 768.3199999999999
you're re some

766.0 --> 769.36
people that that get really depressed

768.32 --> 773.6800000000001
and

769.36 --> 778.16
they get super reckless

773.68 --> 781.12
yeah like those people shouldn't even be

778.16 --> 781.12
allowed to just

783.6 --> 787.839
it's hard to deal with

795.519 --> 801.839
all right

808.16 --> 811.36
but yeah it's a whole crazy situation in

810.399 --> 813.6
germany to

811.36 --> 815.839
all the lockdown places are just it's

813.6 --> 815.839
crazy

816.24 --> 819.839
doesn't make any damn sense

820.24 --> 827.36
it's open criminal because there is

823.519 --> 831.519
no good excuse to do that at all

827.36 --> 831.519
it's only detrimental for everything

832.639 --> 839.519
and i do i definitely feel that

836.24 --> 842.72
at the end of this like every

839.519 --> 844.48
single group that is

842.72 --> 846.88
and in government people that have

844.48 --> 849.519
decided upon lockdowns that should be

846.88 --> 852.16
like a mark

849.519 --> 853.44
that literally will eventually get you

852.16 --> 856.16
punished

853.44 --> 857.519
like no it should be forbidden and i've

856.16 --> 859.12
been hearing this also

857.519 --> 861.279
other people say this should be

859.12 --> 864.48
forbidden lockdown should be

861.279 --> 866.8
forbidden illegal

864.48 --> 869.12
maybe you should i don't know put it in

866.8 --> 870.8
the geneva convention or what is it no

869.12 --> 873.36
that's not

870.8 --> 875.04
the place how does that work again

873.36 --> 878.88
freaking human rights

875.04 --> 881.36
blah ah i've been away from that

878.88 --> 881.36
too long

882.079 --> 885.8389999999999
i call that

893.199 --> 897.04
like this really sounds stupid like this

895.519 --> 899.839
i don't know i don't know how

897.04 --> 899.8389999999999
the group

905.44 --> 909.0400000000001
it is geneva convention

910.639 --> 915.92
right it should be put in there like no

913.839 --> 918.1600000000001
you're not allowed to do lockdowns

915.92 --> 927.8389999999999
you're you no you don't

918.16 --> 927.8389999999999
not not like that

939.88 --> 942.96
[Music]

948.399 --> 957.279
right anyway uh

954.24 --> 960.399
yeah i didn't go to bed that late

957.279 --> 963.199
yesterday so yeah

960.399 --> 963.68
because i my rhythm has been moving like

963.199 --> 966.4799999999999
way

963.68 --> 969.8389999999999
late and i finally managed to get it a

966.48 --> 969.839
bit back to normal again

973.92 --> 977.279
barely made any notes

979.759 --> 983.839
geneva convention is about armed

981.6 --> 989.44
conflict

983.839 --> 989.44
hmm okay well then it wouldn't apply but

994.16 --> 998.7199999999999
i don't know how else to classify it

996.48 --> 998.72
even

1000.8 --> 1004.0
i don't know it should be i guess

1002.48 --> 1007.279
classified under

1004.0 --> 1009.759
things like human rights

1007.279 --> 1012.24
just like technically slavery isn't

1009.759 --> 1012.24
allowed

1017.6 --> 1026.16
right anyway so afterwards

1024.48 --> 1028.079
for now we're dealing just with a whole

1026.16 --> 1032.4
bunch of politicians that are just

1028.079 --> 1032.3999999999999
causing havoc with this insanity

1033.52 --> 1039.839
and they're not exactly making

1035.039 --> 1039.839
themselves popular with it

1045.76 --> 1053.84
european law of human rights okie dokie

1074.24 --> 1081.84
hey miss kang

1082.64 --> 1086.88
hey rest ahead good to see you

1088.0 --> 1092.72
yeah i'm gonna be a lot calmer today

1089.84 --> 1096.6399999999999
than it was yesterday i think

1092.72 --> 1099.84
because i threw it out most of it

1096.64 --> 1102.3200000000002
had been building for a while you know

1099.84 --> 1103.84
and it's it's a lot warmer it's like

1102.32 --> 1107.12
almost border

1103.84 --> 1107.12
bordering no t-shirt

1107.28 --> 1111.36
but

1109.17 --> 1123.8400000000001
[Music]

1111.36 --> 1123.84
i'm just gonna take it easy

1144.559 --> 1146.8799999999999
what

1148.84 --> 1165.84
okay are you sure

1152.16 --> 1165.8400000000001
he said that's kind of silly

1166.0 --> 1169.039
i'm surprised that people would even

1167.679 --> 1171.6000000000001
watch me like that

1169.039 --> 1175.2
really are that many people watching

1171.6 --> 1175.1999999999998
it's not like my viewing count

1175.44 --> 1179.8400000000001
is indicating that

1192.72 --> 1196.16
right but hey that's that's all fine you

1194.559 --> 1198.0
know if they if they want to think of me

1196.16 --> 1199.3600000000001
as a joke you think it's all freaking

1198.0 --> 1201.919
funny yeah sure

1199.36 --> 1203.6789999999999
you know that that's the silly thing

1201.919 --> 1205.44
there's another individual in media

1203.679 --> 1207.3600000000001
world that has kind of underwent the

1205.44 --> 1209.8400000000001
same thing

1207.36 --> 1210.799
now there's a little bit more history to

1209.84 --> 1212.3999999999999
that

1210.799 --> 1215.28
but yeah you might know him as alex

1212.4 --> 1218.0
jones holy [ __ ] has that guy been

1215.28 --> 1221.52
ridiculed by the general public

1218.0 --> 1225.2
a lot now we're thinking like

1221.52 --> 1226.1589999999999
past 9 11 holy [ __ ] everybody was

1225.2 --> 1230.159
ridiculing him

1226.159 --> 1230.159
at first now

1231.12 --> 1234.9599999999998
yeah it's different it's more said in

1234.4 --> 1237.52
his

1234.96 --> 1239.28
direction and obviously has a lot of

1237.52 --> 1241.36
connections he doesn't really have the

1239.28 --> 1244.24
flexibility he used to he's

1241.36 --> 1244.8799999999999
you've rolled into certain agendas even

1244.24 --> 1249.6
though he says

1244.88 --> 1251.679
it he it's still his agenda he's just

1249.6 --> 1253.4399999999998
believing in things and riding along

1251.679 --> 1256.72
according to himself

1253.44 --> 1259.2
right well yeah that's

1256.72 --> 1261.3600000000001
if i'm if literally people out there

1259.2 --> 1263.52
that you don't even know about

1261.36 --> 1265.76
apparently have heard about me and my

1263.52 --> 1265.76
show

1266.0 --> 1271.919
and are ridiculing it wow

1269.44 --> 1273.76
that's pretty incredible that means that

1271.919 --> 1277.8400000000001
i'm apparently getting out there

1273.76 --> 1277.84
despite everything

1278.64 --> 1285.039
like are people making clips and i'm

1281.6 --> 1285.039
just not getting to see them

1285.36 --> 1289.76
i know there's like some really stupid

1287.679 --> 1290.5590000000002
troll videos out there of mine from

1289.76 --> 1293.28
ballers

1290.559 --> 1295.2
from bad baller trolls you know those

1293.28 --> 1298.24
have been out there for a while

1295.2 --> 1299.039
but yeah who who's gonna care about that

1298.24 --> 1302.4
[ __ ] that's

1299.039 --> 1305.36
just garbage like and not

1302.4 --> 1308.159
they usually show garbage of themselves

1305.36 --> 1312.1589999999999
before they even show it

1308.159 --> 1314.3200000000002
you know so

1312.159 --> 1315.6000000000001
that's not gonna matter at all it's

1314.32 --> 1318.3999999999999
gonna be very obvious

1315.6 --> 1320.7199999999998
as to what that is but if people are

1318.4 --> 1324.0
really watching my show

1320.72 --> 1327.1200000000001
and then saying oh my god what an idiot

1324.0 --> 1329.919
he just doesn't understand

1327.12 --> 1330.9599999999998
that's funny to me you know what that

1329.919 --> 1334.0
means

1330.96 --> 1334.64
that they're not like hmm but they're

1334.0 --> 1337.2
like oh

1334.64 --> 1338.159
it's stupid that means i kind of got to

1337.2 --> 1343.44
them apparently

1338.159 --> 1343.44
that's typically what i do i go

1343.76 --> 1352.0
like i just i just do what i do

1347.36 --> 1354.3999999999999
and i'm super direct and i do that

1352.0 --> 1356.72
to basically honor the individual

1354.4 --> 1357.76
despite whatever their code of conduct

1356.72 --> 1359.44
may be

1357.76 --> 1360.8799999999999
in their own way you know i'm not going

1359.44 --> 1363.8400000000001
along with little

1360.88 --> 1366.64
image plans like that i just freaking

1363.84 --> 1370.1589999999999
straight out analyze you and do it

1366.64 --> 1374.5590000000002
do it all and then if the person

1370.159 --> 1377.2
actually visibly changes or feelably

1374.559 --> 1378.799
i can feel that [ __ ] i keep track of

1377.2 --> 1382.0800000000002
people if they change for the better

1378.799 --> 1382.8799999999999
then i'll support them that's how i do

1382.08 --> 1386.1589999999999
things

1382.88 --> 1387.7600000000002
it's very straightforward and yeah

1386.159 --> 1388.159
there's a lot of people out there that

1387.76 --> 1392.1589999999999
just

1388.159 --> 1394.159
like oh that's it's too bright

1392.159 --> 1395.5200000000002
it's too bright so it's just stupid why

1394.159 --> 1397.7600000000002
would you do that why would you

1395.52 --> 1398.6399999999999
be too bright that's ridiculous you're

1397.76 --> 1402.0
gonna

1398.64 --> 1405.44
look like an idiot like a human

1402.0 --> 1407.6
right right yeah that's fine

1405.44 --> 1409.679
that's a good response that's better

1407.6 --> 1412.3999999999999
than huh

1409.679 --> 1412.4
i don't get it

1413.84 --> 1419.76
so if yeah if people are outraged well

1415.919 --> 1423.919
that apparently i'm getting to them

1419.76 --> 1428.4
starting to branch out in

1423.919 --> 1430.88
in my living area spirit wise

1428.4 --> 1431.679
let me call that again taking up

1430.88 --> 1435.3600000000001
residence

1431.679 --> 1435.3600000000001
in people's minds that's good

1435.52 --> 1438.4
i'm i'm uh

1438.96 --> 1443.3600000000001
you know i keep the police place clean i

1441.84 --> 1445.84
actually tend to clean up

1443.36 --> 1445.84
houses

1446.4 --> 1450.48
because it just can't stand junk so yeah

1448.64 --> 1451.039
if i take up residence in somebody's

1450.48 --> 1455.1200000000001
head

1451.039 --> 1457.919
that's probably gonna be better for them

1455.12 --> 1458.6399999999999
but they might just struggle against it

1457.919 --> 1462.0
forever

1458.64 --> 1464.24
and just sink into oblivion

1462.0 --> 1465.76
or they can actually learn to get to

1464.24 --> 1468.88
know me and figure out that

1465.76 --> 1470.64
maybe i have some good points and i'm

1468.88 --> 1473.8400000000001
just a normal human being

1470.64 --> 1479.679
trying to make being

1473.84 --> 1479.6789999999999
a normal human being normal again

1481.2 --> 1488.24
instead of all this acting and narrative

1485.039 --> 1490.559
posing [ __ ] and agitation tactics

1488.24 --> 1490.559
right

1491.679 --> 1501.3600000000001
make being a normal human being

1495.279 --> 1515.18
normal again

1501.36 --> 1524.099
i think i got a title for the show

1515.18 --> 1524.0990000000002
[Music]

1540.84 --> 1546.3999999999999
hmm

1542.48 --> 1547.279
ah no but i'm just surprised signing

1546.4 --> 1550.799
wumbo

1547.279 --> 1554.159
like random people know me

1550.799 --> 1554.1589999999999
nobody's telling me though

1554.799 --> 1558.96
like i wonder sometimes how many people

1556.88 --> 1562.0
out there recognize me

1558.96 --> 1562.64
or is it all just a giant blur of media

1562.0 --> 1564.88
people

1562.64 --> 1566.72
to them that they can't really

1564.88 --> 1567.44
distinguish people anymore they just

1566.72 --> 1570.32
recognize

1567.44 --> 1571.6000000000001
hey he kind of stands out because i

1570.32 --> 1576.799
don't look like a

1571.6 --> 1578.9599999999998
pajama wearing soy boy soy face idiot

1576.799 --> 1580.08
and they're just like oh he must be

1578.96 --> 1583.44
somebody like that

1580.08 --> 1583.4399999999998
i wonder what he's into

1583.52 --> 1587.44
but it could be that people out there

1585.919 --> 1590.0
actually watch my show i

1587.44 --> 1591.279
have shared that i have a show daily

1590.0 --> 1594.48
show with

1591.279 --> 1599.84
well with the two handful of people

1594.48 --> 1599.84
at least out there so i wonder

1601.84 --> 1606.24
i wonder how many people actually watch

1603.76 --> 1606.24
my show

1607.52 --> 1612.24
hey tom parker yeah my weekend was

1610.24 --> 1615.44

1612.24 --> 1615.44
especially yesterday

1617.279 --> 1621.12
flat earth early bird show i got pretty

1619.039 --> 1627.84
raged

1621.12 --> 1627.84
raged up

1628.4 --> 1633.039
yeah after that i haven't really been on

1631.76 --> 1636.4
to anything

1633.039 --> 1638.84
listening to this 24 7 discord

1636.4 --> 1640.0800000000002
like in the background was no own

1638.84 --> 1643.84
benjamin

1640.08 --> 1643.84
just played games

1644.799 --> 1650.1589999999999

don't look for disgusting things

1653.2 --> 1656.3990000000001
then eventually stop shoving it in your

1655.12 --> 1658.7199999999998
face although still

1656.399 --> 1660.0
always get the lucifer stupid series in

fired up i completely forgot

1668.48 --> 1673.76
to tell everyone that i actually watched

1671.279 --> 1678.08
two movies that were like

1673.76 --> 1680.8799999999999
pretty damn fun that was saturday

1678.08 --> 1680.8799999999999
saturday evening

1681.44 --> 1685.52
it's like i watched a sec unexpected

1684.0 --> 1688.799
second

1685.52 --> 1691.9189999999999
johnny english movie like with the

1688.799 --> 1691.9189999999999
withdrawn atkinson

and yeah awesome there were just some

1695.36 --> 1700.08
amazing

1696.799 --> 1703.279
amazing jokes in there so like he

1700.08 --> 1704.48
is still mr bean but he's also a secret

1703.279 --> 1707.6
agent

1704.48 --> 1711.84
and he's also very smart so

1707.6 --> 1711.84
he's like a blend between mr bean

1712.0 --> 1718.96
like a real genuine secret agent and

1716.399 --> 1721.52
black adder or something it's it's

1718.96 --> 1724.08
something else

1721.52 --> 1725.52
and like there were some parodies on

1724.08 --> 1727.6789999999999
action scenes that i was

1725.52 --> 1729.2
super impressed with like super

1727.679 --> 1733.279
impressed that was so good

1729.2 --> 1735.3600000000001
so funny very original

1733.279 --> 1737.44
where yeah he would be following a guy

1735.36 --> 1739.84
that was all action

1737.44 --> 1741.44
uh they were climbing around buildings

1739.84 --> 1744.1589999999999
and jumping over fence oh what do you

1741.44 --> 1746.72
call that again the

1744.159 --> 1746.72
has a name

1747.52 --> 1753.6
and yeah he's a bit of an older guy

1750.64 --> 1754.24
and he got taught by his zen master or

1753.6 --> 1758.24
whatever

1754.24 --> 1760.0
like yeah with age you lose yeah you

1758.24 --> 1760.559
lose some strength but you also gain

1760.0 --> 1763.76
wisdom

1760.559 --> 1765.76
use the wisdom and then every time

1763.76 --> 1767.36
like the guy would just jump over

1765.76 --> 1768.0
impressive physical feats and he would

1767.36 --> 1770.9599999999998
be like

1768.0 --> 1772.32
hmm hey there's a door there i'll just

1770.96 --> 1773.8400000000001
open it and go through

1772.32 --> 1776.559
and then the next scene something

1773.84 --> 1779.36
exactly alike happens every time

1776.559 --> 1780.24
the guy thinks i'm getting away and then

1779.36 --> 1782.24
he's just oh no

1780.24 --> 1783.279
put just a ladder over it and climb down

1782.24 --> 1786.64
very calmly

1783.279 --> 1789.279
the guy runs away again and he like goes

1786.64 --> 1790.88
like all down past the building and then

1789.279 --> 1794.48
he thinks like oh [ __ ]

1790.88 --> 1798.5590000000002
okay i'll just take the elevator down

1794.48 --> 1801.279
oh it was just so funny

1798.559 --> 1804.48
i was really impressed with that i love

1801.279 --> 1804.48
i love this character

1806.159 --> 1809.2
right the first one was also great so

1808.399 --> 1812.4799999999998
the second one

1809.2 --> 1812.48
might have even been better

1813.2 --> 1818.0
anyway and i also after that it's been a

1816.24 --> 1821.679
long time was

1818.0 --> 1825.52
watched the mask

1821.679 --> 1829.44
jim carrey and damn that movie is

1825.52 --> 1833.12
good like the cgi is crap

1829.44 --> 1836.0800000000002
compared to like yeah it's just uh

1833.12 --> 1837.039
it's very outdated but it doesn't matter

1836.08 --> 1840.559
because

1837.039 --> 1843.84
the whole movie is so vibrant and manic

1840.559 --> 1846.559
and just like the guy is so

1843.84 --> 1847.4399999999998
full of loss he just radiates it and

1846.559 --> 1849.76
that's

1847.44 --> 1851.039
it yeah it's infectious so maybe the

1849.76 --> 1854.72
watching the mask

1851.039 --> 1854.72
actually kind of

1855.2 --> 1862.3990000000001
fed into my my passion or

1858.399 --> 1862.399
my passionate rage the next day

1863.36 --> 1868.08
but yeah what a fun movie is that so i

1866.559 --> 1870.96
had a lot of fun saturday

1868.08 --> 1879.84
but i completely forgot to review it so

1870.96 --> 1879.8400000000001
i'm doing it right now

1887.84 --> 1894.6399999999999
uh what the [ __ ]

1891.279 --> 1896.48
dude if he come running through the door

1894.64 --> 1896.96
and everything i wouldn't even recognize

1896.48 --> 1900.72
him

1896.96 --> 1907.8400000000001
i'd just be like uh can i help you

1900.72 --> 1907.84
i don't know how the [ __ ] he looks

1910.62 --> 1914.7199999999998
[Music]

1912.32 --> 1917.4399999999998
yeah tom parker i get it but it's just

1914.72 --> 1920.96
such a silly question

1917.44 --> 1923.8400000000001
that yeah i just

1920.96 --> 1925.679
like i i kind of remember how he looked

1923.84 --> 1927.6
like as a kid you know i don't know how

1925.679 --> 1931.279
he looks now

1927.6 --> 1931.279
i i literally don't know

1931.36 --> 1935.279
i wouldn't recognize him i just think oh

1933.36 --> 1939.36
it's another dude and he's

1935.279 --> 1940.559
yeah he takes good care of himself

1939.36 --> 1942.9599999999998
probably

1940.559 --> 1949.84
his looks or whatever that's it i

1942.96 --> 1949.8400000000001
wouldn't recognize him

1954.0 --> 1958.08
it's probably me by himself

1960.0 --> 1980.24
that would be funny i wouldn't mind

1977.84 --> 1980.24
all right

1982.32 --> 1991.84
i have a good breakfast the rest ahead

1994.64 --> 1999.6000000000001
oh man that tea is really hot

1997.22 --> 2001.519
[Music]

1999.6 --> 2003.279
gotta drink something and i haven't had

2001.519 --> 2006.88
any coffee today again

2003.279 --> 2009.36
i'm quitting like for a while

2006.88 --> 2010.0
and i'm having some trouble with it

2009.36 --> 2012.7199999999998
because i do

2010.0 --> 2014.399
long for it especially in the morning

2012.72 --> 2017.6000000000001
it's like

2014.399 --> 2020.6399999999999
i want it but yeah

2017.6 --> 2023.4399999999998
since i haven't taken coffee it's

2020.64 --> 2025.1200000000001
like very directly it's like a big

2023.44 --> 2027.76
signal right there

2025.12 --> 2028.4799999999998
since i haven't taken it suddenly like

2027.76 --> 2030.84
my jaw

2028.48 --> 2033.76
problems the inflammation the issues the

2030.84 --> 2034.8799999999999
muscle tension it's all going away

2033.76 --> 2037.919
slowly

2034.88 --> 2041.0390000000002
it's still a bit sore but

2037.919 --> 2041.44
it's no longer tense so yeah so i need

2041.039 --> 2044.559
to

2041.44 --> 2046.48
keep quitting for now

2044.559 --> 2049.359
what's wrong with coffee well it does

2046.48 --> 2053.119
all kinds of things with your system

2049.359 --> 2056.159
especially it yeah it can aggravate

2053.119 --> 2058.079
tension if you're like very tense

2056.159 --> 2059.599
then it's going to aggravate it and

2058.079 --> 2062.159
probably yeah

2059.599 --> 2064.2400000000002
pile up symptoms and that's been

2062.159 --> 2067.359
happening for a while

2064.24 --> 2070.56
you know but now i can even just sleep

2067.359 --> 2072.639
on this side and there's no issues

2070.56 --> 2074.879
so it's really going away and that's

2072.639 --> 2078.879
worth it for me to quit

2074.879 --> 2078.879
coffee for the time being at least

2084.399 --> 2087.52
in the morning i have coffee and then i

2086.159 --> 2091.359
do stuff yeah

2087.52 --> 2092.96
well me too well first i take my

2091.359 --> 2096.0789999999997
supplements

2092.96 --> 2096.079
then i wait for a bit

2096.32 --> 2101.2000000000003
then i take coffee i first have to

2098.24 --> 2104.9599999999996
mentally wake up before i take coffee

2101.2 --> 2108.16
here's why if i hurry up coffee too much

2104.96 --> 2110.64
when i'm still like in the hazy

2108.16 --> 2112.96
mines and i take the coffee i actually

2110.64 --> 2115.7599999999998
fall asleep from it

2112.96 --> 2118.96
i have to wake up first mentally before

2115.76 --> 2118.96
i take coffee anyway

2126.88 --> 2131.119
oh dear caffeine crystals goody yeah

2129.92 --> 2133.6800000000003
well the caffeine is

2131.119 --> 2133.6800000000003
the problem

2134.48 --> 2138.079
caffeine is exactly what is causing the

2136.72 --> 2141.7599999999998
problem if i take

2138.079 --> 2145.8390000000004
decaf which i not gonna do

2141.76 --> 2145.8390000000004
i i wouldn't have that problem probably

2149.8 --> 2152.8590000000004
[Music]

2154.48 --> 2159.839
coffee is my morning supplements

2156.0 --> 2159.839
vitamins at nighttime

2161.119 --> 2168.8
i i take some supplements at the night

2165.599 --> 2173.28
i usually take things yeah all

2168.8 --> 2175.92
my fish oil and is it

2173.28 --> 2175.92
chlorella

2176.64 --> 2181.2799999999997
and it's called again

2182.32 --> 2189.599
yes the lg extract thing so like

2186.32 --> 2190.56
my c portion i take that at night before

2189.599 --> 2192.88
bed

2190.56 --> 2195.119
because then can really help it yeah

2192.88 --> 2195.839
that is absorbed best during the sleep

2195.119 --> 2199.44
cycle

2195.839 --> 2204.0789999999997
and then in the morning i take my d3

2199.44 --> 2205.839
b12 taking selenium now

2204.079 --> 2207.6800000000003
now that i'm not taking coffee anymore

2205.839 --> 2209.2
no because there's also some tumeric in

2207.68 --> 2212.24
there

2209.2 --> 2215.839
and k2

2212.24 --> 2215.839
and that's good enough for me

2216.32 --> 2229.839
all natural well organic

2219.52 --> 2229.839
organic brand

2234.079 --> 2239.04
it's the acidity in the coffee no it's

2236.24 --> 2239.04
the caffeine

2241.04 --> 2246.0
it does throw off the gut flora a little

2243.2 --> 2246.0
that's correct

2247.599 --> 2251.04
but it is literally the caffeine that

2250.079 --> 2253.599
cause it's

2251.04 --> 2254.32
like in the books it's right there

2253.599 --> 2257.119
caffeine

2254.32 --> 2258.48
specifically so yeah there's issues with

2257.119 --> 2260.7200000000003
coffee and hey i take

2258.48 --> 2262.88
i don't take any more milk in my coffee

2260.72 --> 2264.9599999999996
but i do still take some sugar and yeah

2262.88 --> 2266.56
sugar in general also doesn't really

2264.96 --> 2270.4
help with that

2266.56 --> 2272.7999999999997
so but it's definitely the caffeine look

2270.4 --> 2275.44
if you don't have any issues like that

2272.8 --> 2278.48
then by all means yeah take as much

2275.44 --> 2278.48
caffeine as you like

2279.44 --> 2283.98
i am not gonna take some caffeine for a

2282.839 --> 2287.0589999999997
while

2283.98 --> 2287.059
[Music]

2290.24 --> 2293.5989999999997
any certain brand

2295.44 --> 2299.839
okay okay rest i could be

2301.28 --> 2305.28
yeah for overall regenerative

2305.359 --> 2311.52
situation not having coffee at all would

2309.44 --> 2314.16
probably help just as sugar

2311.52 --> 2316.8
kinda does the same a little but the

2314.16 --> 2319.68
caffeine is specifically for

2316.8 --> 2321.76
muscle cramp situations that's

2319.68 --> 2326.72
specifically what causes that it's

2321.76 --> 2328.96
in the books

2326.72 --> 2329.9199999999996
and that that's been the issues just my

2328.96 --> 2331.839
jaw was like

2329.92 --> 2333.599
it was getting locked it's just getting

2331.839 --> 2334.0
more cramped more locked and i could

2333.599 --> 2336.96
still

2334.0 --> 2337.28
open it but i would have to like take

2336.96 --> 2339.44
some

2337.28 --> 2341.3590000000004
effort to really stretch it open because

2339.44 --> 2343.92
it just can't do it certainly

2341.359 --> 2346.48
it's like triggered in the other

2343.92 --> 2346.48
direction

2347.92 --> 2354.96
but yeah that's been going away now

2351.52 --> 2355.7599999999998
very happy about that and yeah there is

2354.96 --> 2359.44
some

2355.76 --> 2361.44
similar substance in in green tea even

2359.44 --> 2363.2000000000003
but i don't know it's not bother it's

2361.44 --> 2366.32
not doing the same thing

2363.2 --> 2369.839
like i don't have any the same effects

2366.32 --> 2369.839
from it

2370.6 --> 2373.73
[Music]

2378.24 --> 2397.839
what really

2381.359 --> 2397.839
i did not know that i had what

2398.0 --> 2411.839
of course

2419.44 --> 2424.0
well you know i'm not very desperate to

2422.72 --> 2427.1189999999997
get caffeine i don't

2424.0 --> 2427.44
really need it it's addictive the thing

2427.119 --> 2430.7200000000003
is

2427.44 --> 2432.7200000000003
i like coffee i like that specific type

2430.72 --> 2434.3999999999996
of coffee it's an organic brand coffee

2432.72 --> 2437.7599999999998
from chiapas

2434.4 --> 2440.4
from mexico and it's

2437.76 --> 2442.079
officially organic and it's a really

2440.4 --> 2446.48
good brand i've been taking it

2442.079 --> 2449.27
for over 12 years

2446.48 --> 2450.4
from that from that farm

2449.27 --> 2453.359
[Music]

2450.4 --> 2455.599
through yeah the coffee specialist and i

2453.359 --> 2456.88
just like that coffee if it's not that

2455.599 --> 2459.119
coffee then

2456.88 --> 2459.92
it's not like oh my god i need caffeine

2459.119 --> 2462.7200000000003
to survive

2459.92 --> 2465.359
no it's not that coffee it's just not

2462.72 --> 2465.359
worth it to me

2465.68 --> 2470.64
then i'll just take green tea you know

2467.28 --> 2470.6400000000003
organic green tea is awesome

2474.96 --> 2478.0
now where coffee is only good in

2476.56 --> 2480.88
moderation

2478.0 --> 2484.16
coffee is good for you i i wouldn't

2480.88 --> 2488.48
necessarily make such a statement myself

2484.16 --> 2491.7599999999998
but i've always taken coffee in in

2488.48 --> 2494.64
moderation absolutely

2491.76 --> 2497.2000000000003
like maximum of two cups a day usually

2494.64 --> 2497.2
just one

2507.2 --> 2511.9199999999996
okay yeah no i'm not foaming at the

2510.079 --> 2516.2400000000002
mouth and

2511.92 --> 2518.16
rabies lasts pretty yeah

2516.24 --> 2520.0789999999997
if i'd have that then i've been having

2518.16 --> 2523.7599999999998
that for over half a year

2520.079 --> 2526.1600000000003
seems extremely unlikely

2523.76 --> 2528.5600000000004
there would be some severe other side

2526.16 --> 2528.56
effects

2534.16 --> 2540.96
now but i've been having jaw issues

2537.76 --> 2540.96
half my life so

2541.28 --> 2551.8390000000004
i had it last year the year before

2544.8 --> 2551.8390000000004
yeah pretty much every year something

2556.8 --> 2565.8390000000004
yeah no there's no birds with rabies

2581.44 --> 2593.839
there's barely any rabies here anyway

2597.359 --> 2607.839
all right so yeah that's definitely not

2599.52 --> 2607.839
it don't worry about it

2608.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
right so anything

2612.319 --> 2621.839
else you guys want to talk about

2638.4 --> 2649.839
okay yeah it's getting very old now

2666.56 --> 2668.88

2877.05 --> 2880.2290000000003
[Music]

2893.52 --> 2897.119
the mighty ducks what

2898.88 --> 2904.1600000000003
this is yeah i know you're a great fan

2902.079 --> 2908.8
of him rest ahead

2904.16 --> 2908.7999999999997
i have my own issues as you well know

2911.599 --> 2918.4
and i do uh i do keep him in line

2915.28 --> 2921.44
sometimes as he thinks he

2918.4 --> 2923.6800000000003
can do with me remember remember that he

2921.44 --> 2926.88
also is like oh it's a self-appointed

2923.68 --> 2930.319
elder like he has authority over other

2926.88 --> 2933.76
people like they're accepting it

2930.319 --> 2933.7599999999998
no not really

2939.2 --> 2957.839
this is okay it seems

2943.68 --> 2957.839
the opinion is somewhat shared

2959.68 --> 2964.16
you like it when i go off on him yeah

2962.079 --> 2965.04
but i only do it when he really deserves

2964.16 --> 2967.2
it

2965.04 --> 2969.359
you know everybody can be like in a bit

2967.2 --> 2972.319
of an interruptive mood

2969.359 --> 2973.839
but sometimes he's just literally

2972.319 --> 2976.079
breaking up

2973.839 --> 2976.88
some very intense train of thought of

2976.079 --> 2979.44
somebody

2976.88 --> 2981.52
to insert something completely useless

2979.44 --> 2982.96
and distracting and that's just freaking

2981.52 --> 2985.52
annoying when he does that

2982.96 --> 2987.44
especially when he insists on finishing

2985.52 --> 2989.7599999999998
that stupid point that nobody cares

2987.44 --> 2989.76
about

2989.92 --> 2998.7200000000003
but other than that i don't know he's

2991.68 --> 3002.96
not ah

2998.72 --> 3002.9599999999996
he's okay you know

3003.599 --> 3006.48
i can deal with it

3006.88 --> 3010.6400000000003
just gonna treat him a bit like an old

3008.559 --> 3013.8390000000004
get sometimes

3010.64 --> 3013.839
that's it

3022.72 --> 3029.839
yeah i don't know what do you guys think

3026.0 --> 3029.839
about his food reviewing channel

3031.52 --> 3035.839
that i don't know it did all look pretty

3034.8 --> 3039.3590000000004
damn tasty

3035.839 --> 3042.4
like his wife is for sure and

3039.359 --> 3055.839
his wife and daughter great cooks

3042.4 --> 3055.839
know it

3060.72 --> 3069.8199999999997
all right

3068.16 --> 3073.729
all right

3069.82 --> 3073.7290000000003
[Music]

3075.28 --> 3081.2000000000003
and to be fair guys

3078.4 --> 3082.1600000000003
i always have to do that right yeah he

3081.2 --> 3086.16
can be very

3082.16 --> 3087.1189999999997
annoying and pointless but sometimes he

3086.16 --> 3089.52
also

3087.119 --> 3090.58
i guess in the non-flat earth category

3089.52 --> 3094.839
sometimes he has

3090.58 --> 3097.7599999999998
[Laughter]

3094.839 --> 3099.7599999999998
sometimes rest

3097.76 --> 3102.6400000000003
sometimes he has some pretty interesting

3099.76 --> 3111.28
things you know he does

3102.64 --> 3115.2
he has knowledge

3111.28 --> 3118.96
yeah but that's not true tom parker

3115.2 --> 3120.7999999999997
he did like when it comes to like uh

3118.96 --> 3122.8
you call that domestic things and all

3120.8 --> 3127.04
that and

3122.8 --> 3130.1600000000003
like being self-sufficient and not yeah

3127.04 --> 3134.4
he knows some things from experience

3130.16 --> 3139.839
but when it comes to the flat earth yeah

3134.4 --> 3139.839
a parrot absolutely

3146.72 --> 3153.839
serpent hey don't go dissing on that

3149.2 --> 3153.839
serpent again

3164.82 --> 3167.849
[Music]

3177.52 --> 3181.68
and i don't know man it doesn't feel

3179.52 --> 3183.68
like he's literally in the way on

3181.68 --> 3186.7999999999997
purpose to disrupt

3183.68 --> 3189.1189999999997
it's more like it's just an old bear

3186.8 --> 3190.96
or something that's just like moved into

3189.119 --> 3192.8
that cave and he's just like no

3190.96 --> 3195.359
this is where i'm gonna lie and yeah in

3192.8 --> 3198.8
the meantime there's just

3195.359 --> 3198.7999999999997
others there doing stuff

3199.2 --> 3209.7599999999998

3203.52 --> 3212.88
and be part of it

3209.76 --> 3213.5200000000004

3212.88 --> 3216.4
