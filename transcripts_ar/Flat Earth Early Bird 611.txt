[Music]

33.68 --> 37.519999999999996
good

34.88 --> 39.28
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

37.52 --> 41.6
number 611

39.28 --> 43.28
i'm your host irwin and before we start

41.6 --> 45.44
the show please don't forget to share it

43.28 --> 47.2
on any platform you deem fit and if you

45.44 --> 48.718999999999994
haven't already subscribe to my channel

47.2 --> 50.079
and hit the bell notification so you

48.719 --> 52.239000000000004
know when i'm going live

50.079 --> 53.28
which is normally 2 p.m amsterdam time

52.239 --> 55.599999999999994
every day

53.28 --> 57.199
please also do support me through paypal

55.6 --> 58.079
patreon the super chat and the

57.199 --> 59.76
membership system

58.079 --> 61.68
join button that would be much

59.76 --> 65.119
appreciated and

61.68 --> 67.6
much needed and thanks

65.119 --> 71.119
for everybody that's keeping me afloat

67.6 --> 73.119
more challenges to come financially

71.119 --> 74.64
already explained a lot about it anyway

73.119 --> 78.56
uh let's

74.64 --> 82.24
see what the weather is like it's yeah

78.56 --> 86.32000000000001
unpredictable it's now clouded up but

82.24 --> 90.079
it's still very warm

86.32 --> 93.27999999999999
like very clouded up and yeah there's

90.079 --> 94.88
apparently some dog training course

93.28 --> 100.32000000000001
going on

94.88 --> 101.52
down there very loud person this is kind

100.32 --> 105.119
of cute though

101.52 --> 106.24
doggies but they're doing some kind of

105.119 --> 109.759
training or something

106.24 --> 112.56
anyway yeah it is kind of raining back

109.759 --> 112.56
and forth a little

112.799 --> 118.24000000000001
they did manage to stay dry when going

114.88 --> 118.24
out for groceries this morning

120.479 --> 122.88
right

124.56 --> 131.36
let's see who is in check

128.879 --> 133.12
ah amanda young was first here we go

131.36 --> 135.76000000000002
again tiny wumble

133.12 --> 137.52
robin stanley good to have you back

135.76 --> 142.07999999999998
steve

137.52 --> 144.87900000000002
tom parker obermockel

142.08 --> 144.87900000000002
good servant

147.2 --> 159.92
martin tolberg

157.04 --> 162.56
getting sick yeah good to see you all on

159.92 --> 166.48
this monday

162.56 --> 168.879
started right on time right so i had a

166.48 --> 171.28
pretty wild day yesterday oh thank you

168.879 --> 174.959
for the dollar super chat donation

171.28 --> 178.4
anyway i got a tamara coffee like

174.959 --> 181.68
uh what is it an 80 sized

178.4 --> 184.72
not too much i already had one but

181.68 --> 188.0
because yeah a

184.72 --> 191.04
very weird night yesterday i like

188.0 --> 194.56
i threw up i got sick just

191.04 --> 195.67999999999998
from yeah from because of the red wine i

194.56 --> 198.959
think

195.68 --> 199.84
and weird im yeah it was a very unusual

198.959 --> 203.2
situation

199.84 --> 205.519
yesterday and i'm i'm starting to wonder

203.2 --> 208.07999999999998
like did i

205.519 --> 208.64000000000001
psychotically psychosomatically cause it

208.08 --> 211.20000000000002
by

208.64 --> 212.07999999999998
a certain little weird mind game that i

211.2 --> 215.11999999999998
play with myself

212.08 --> 217.36
it's extremely arbitrary so it's like

215.12 --> 219.04
literally divining clouds or something

217.36 --> 221.92000000000002
you could compare it to that it's

219.04 --> 223.76
definitely not significant that's why

221.92 --> 225.28
you say psychosomatically like i made it

223.76 --> 227.44
this very blatant

225.28 --> 229.12
mistake it's not a mistake nobody will

227.44 --> 231.44
even notice it existed that that

229.12 --> 231.44
happened

231.519 --> 236.08
and that is bad luck to me it's kind of

234.08 --> 239.20000000000002
a stupid game that i held on to

236.08 --> 241.20000000000002
i even at the start of doing that born

239.2 --> 243.2
out of boredom

241.2 --> 246.07999999999998
i was realizing yeah like if that could

243.2 --> 250.159
go wrong it could really go wrong but

246.08 --> 253.04000000000002
i just kept on doing it anyway and

250.159 --> 254.56
because of that yeah yesterday after

253.04 --> 256.88
that thing happened

254.56 --> 258.32
like a lot of things went really wrong

256.88 --> 261.199
like when i got home

258.32 --> 262.4
i had a red wine bottle and it basically

261.199 --> 264.56
broke on me

262.4 --> 266.23999999999995
like as i was pulling it out of my bag

264.56 --> 269.36
the the top broke off

266.24 --> 271.6
like the [ __ ] splash splash

269.36 --> 272.88
so i managed to actually save most of

271.6 --> 274.639
that vents if did it

272.88 --> 276.24
put it in an old bottle that i watched

274.639 --> 279.28000000000003
first

276.24 --> 282.40000000000003
and but yeah the intention you know the

279.28 --> 287.03999999999996
when there's like this this weird off

282.4 --> 289.12
and broken frequency it doesn't infuse

287.04 --> 290.56
the stuff with good spirit as it goes

289.12 --> 293.04
like you could say

290.56 --> 297.44
and yeah apparently that hit me back in

293.04 --> 300.639
the evening

297.44 --> 302.639
all right well rob instead i can

300.639 --> 305.44
actually pinpoint the moment

302.639 --> 306.72
that i threw up and why what was the

305.44 --> 311.84
final drop in the

306.72 --> 315.44000000000005
in the bucket it was a flat earth debate

311.84 --> 316.15999999999997
when john got in and was in a really bad

315.44 --> 318.71999999999997
mood and he

316.16 --> 322.32000000000005
really just destroyed the good

318.72 --> 324.56
atmosphere of the conversation

322.32 --> 326.24
and when i was listening to that i was

324.56 --> 327.68
already kind of feeble i was like oh

326.24 --> 329.6
[ __ ] i need to calm down

327.68 --> 331.52
but i had my computer still running and

329.6 --> 333.52000000000004
then that happened and there was such a

331.52 --> 336.15999999999997
bad load of energy that just i couldn't

333.52 --> 339.59999999999997
take it anymore

336.16 --> 340.639
so thanks john it's now it's not his

339.6 --> 345.12
fault

340.639 --> 345.12
but yeah that was kind of weird

345.759 --> 351.52000000000004
rarely happens really very rare that

348.16 --> 354.72
that sort of stuff happens to me

351.52 --> 357.19899999999996
thank god and i didn't even drink like

354.72 --> 357.91900000000004
an usual amount or anything it just

357.199 --> 361.039
everything just

357.919 --> 364.84
felt fell wrong

361.039 --> 368.24
for gear travolin as they say in dutch

364.84 --> 368.23999999999995
anyway uh

368.72 --> 373.6
yeah there was no again there was no own

372.24 --> 376.479
benjamin

373.6 --> 377.6
really it was very frustrating it's the

376.479 --> 379.28
second day in a row

377.6 --> 380.8
and yeah apparently he now does his

379.28 --> 382.79999999999995
night stream and he's just skipping

380.8 --> 384.08
these morning streams i'm not very happy

382.8 --> 386.319
about that

384.08 --> 388.639
because i can't watch the night streams

386.319 --> 391.03900000000004
it's impossible for me

388.639 --> 392.84000000000003
there's no replay and i don't have a

391.039 --> 396.15999999999997
subscription to his

392.84 --> 398.479
site maybe i should

396.16 --> 400.56
but i can't afford that on top of all

398.479 --> 404.0
the other [ __ ]

400.56 --> 409.84
that's been shoving itself in my face

404.0 --> 409.84
financially so

416.08 --> 420.88
right did watch my show back i thought

419.199 --> 423.52000000000004
it was good

420.88 --> 426.56
a lot about food i actually when i

423.52 --> 429.35999999999996
watched it i got hungry

426.56 --> 429.36
the second half

429.599 --> 437.84
so that was kind of funny

438.639 --> 442.72
but yeah there's some good details in

441.12 --> 445.12
there and

442.72 --> 445.12
i like

446.4 --> 451.19899999999996
the idea of using intentions and

449.44 --> 454.8
cymatics to

451.199 --> 457.44
see if you can alter the the growth path

454.8 --> 458.0
of crystal structures as they are

457.44 --> 462.639
forming

458.0 --> 462.639
it's interesting i i like that i

463.44 --> 466.8
that i came up with that sort of yeah i

466.479 --> 468.8
did

466.8 --> 471.199
i didn't read it somewhere else this is

468.8 --> 473.36
my my idea

471.199 --> 474.24
maybe somebody else thought of it too

473.36 --> 477.199
but i

474.24 --> 478.24
haven't yeah listened to anybody talking

477.199 --> 481.68
about that

478.24 --> 484.639
for a long time bar the the works of dr

481.68 --> 487.759
emote i did follow a lot of that

484.639 --> 493.84000000000003
no i haven't seen anybody's experiment

487.759 --> 493.84000000000003
what is this what's that supposed to be

504.84 --> 507.84
right

508.4 --> 512.0799999999999
morphic resonance what does that mean

516.32 --> 519.9190000000001
yeah it's by the way really funny that

518.399 --> 521.68
you're bringing that up because i was

519.919 --> 525.04
watching glitch

521.68 --> 526.3199999999999
and they've definitely used in that

525.04 --> 530.7199999999999
series

526.32 --> 533.7600000000001
cymatics as like a sandbox

530.72 --> 535.6800000000001
basic fantastical inspiring concept

533.76 --> 537.279
that is supposed to have a direct

535.68 --> 539.279
influence on the whole

537.279 --> 541.12
series like they're basically tying it

539.279 --> 542.32
with resurrection and all that's pretty

541.12 --> 545.44
weird

542.32 --> 548.1600000000001
very sci-fi-ish but they yeah they

545.44 --> 548.72
literally even show cymatics being done

548.16 --> 550.88
with the

548.72 --> 553.9200000000001
with grains of salt in this case in the

550.88 --> 557.04
series it was interesting

553.92 --> 558.7199999999999
uh and kind of like uncanny that that

557.04 --> 560.399
popped up yesterday i was watching

558.72 --> 562.9590000000001
glitch again

560.399 --> 563.92
i had talked about it cymatics you know

562.959 --> 566.7199999999999
crystal structures

563.92 --> 568.4799999999999
and then it kind of revealed itself like

566.72 --> 573.2
yeah

568.48 --> 573.2
cymatics oh okay

573.279 --> 577.8389999999999
coinkidink there's such a thing anymore

580.16 --> 583.8389999999999
it changes everything wow

584.56 --> 591.5999999999999
yeah well thanks for the ad without

588.08 --> 593.36
any actual content and i think i'll just

591.6 --> 595.279
skip that

593.36 --> 596.48
somebody else would like to inform me

595.279 --> 599.36
about

596.48 --> 599.36
that maybe uh

600.48 --> 603.9200000000001
maybe amanda young could tell me

602.079 --> 606.079
something about that she likes to follow

603.92 --> 606.079
him

607.2 --> 619.839
i don't

620.88 --> 625.04
yeah obamacare don't welcome him just

622.72 --> 625.0400000000001
yet

626.32 --> 633.839
seems like a sock

636.0 --> 647.839
hmm all right robin stanley interesting

640.0 --> 647.839
is that still the same comment i take it

655.6 --> 662.0
okay so that's two minutes now is there

660.32 --> 674.0790000000001
anything you would like to add

662.0 --> 676.399
90a or am i just going to ban you

674.079 --> 677.5999999999999
i don't like text billboards to be

676.399 --> 679.839
basically placed

677.6 --> 681.0400000000001
inside my chat for somebody else that

679.839 --> 686.1600000000001
doesn't have

681.04 --> 689.1999999999999
anything good to offer to me

686.16 --> 691.92
how objects disappear

689.2 --> 691.9200000000001
oh really

697.839 --> 703.839
all right so it's not an experiment then

707.44 --> 712.0790000000001
yeah that's really nice 1980 it's not an

710.079 --> 712.7199999999999
experiment you can't very manipulate

712.079 --> 715.92
anything

712.72 --> 718.48
terrestrial you can figure out how it

715.92 --> 721.519
works and how it doesn't work of course

718.48 --> 726.16
i know but it's not an experiment

721.519 --> 726.16
you could call it a test at best

726.959 --> 731.5999999999999
because if you want to experiment then

729.279 --> 734.24
you actually have to very manipulate

731.6 --> 736.72
something alter it into it in order to

734.24 --> 742.16
establish a cause

736.72 --> 742.1600000000001
and yeah distances and all that do not

742.839 --> 745.839
abide

747.12 --> 751.44
right yeah well i call it basically

750.24 --> 754.639
diffraction

751.44 --> 756.399
diffraction is a you could call it a an

754.639 --> 759.92
optics-based word soup

756.399 --> 762.24
it is that though it is riley's disk

759.92 --> 764.56
angular resolution and perspective all

762.24 --> 767.12
of that in once it's basically

764.56 --> 768.8
lens function part of lens function

767.12 --> 770.88
optics you could just generally say

768.8 --> 772.56
optics because it is many factors that

770.88 --> 776.48
are tied in with one another

772.56 --> 779.8389999999999
that cause the effect but you can

776.48 --> 780.88
achieve that effect over absolutely

779.839 --> 784.48
geometrically

780.88 --> 786.16
measured proven flat surfaces over

784.48 --> 787.839
all kinds of distances even short

786.16 --> 790.88
distances so

787.839 --> 793.2
that basically shows you that it is

790.88 --> 797.8389999999999
naturally around even without any

793.2 --> 801.0400000000001
form of actual physical curvature

797.839 --> 802.8800000000001
it just happens so yeah

801.04 --> 805.12
ether band yeah that's not really a

802.88 --> 805.12
thing

805.92 --> 810.639
ether band is just a region where the

808.079 --> 815.519
miraging and all that the distortion

810.639 --> 817.6800000000001
due to refraction happens

815.519 --> 819.279
and the diffraction is the thing that

817.68 --> 823.279
kind of helps manifest

819.279 --> 826.72
the apparent horizon effect and the

823.279 --> 829.279
bottom bottoms up concealment that's how

826.72 --> 830.88
i tie it in so i i try to really

829.279 --> 833.04
distinguish between

830.88 --> 834.56
yeah refraction the actual one not

833.04 --> 837.12
terrestrial

834.56 --> 837.8389999999999
and diffraction and split them apart

837.12 --> 839.76
because i

837.839 --> 841.839
yeah i think they really do have very

839.76 --> 844.959
distinct different

841.839 --> 847.36
effects that you can isolate from one

844.959 --> 847.3599999999999
another

849.279 --> 853.92
i hope i will turn out to be completely

851.519 --> 853.92
correct

854.8 --> 860.079
because it's still still to this day

857.12 --> 860.079
kind of complicated

867.44 --> 872.24
yeah yeah funny i know yeah word soup is

870.399 --> 875.519
just lovely now to use

872.24 --> 876.32
the thing is just because it's soup

875.519 --> 878.48
doesn't mean

876.32 --> 879.6
that it's not good soup doesn't mean

878.48 --> 881.04
that it'll actually

879.6 --> 883.44
feed you you might actually learn

881.04 --> 884.48
something from it but it is kind of like

883.44 --> 887.9200000000001
a soup

884.48 --> 888.9590000000001
of a lot of different things optics you

887.92 --> 890.959
know

888.959 --> 892.6389999999999
it's not as straightforward as a lot of

890.959 --> 899.8389999999999
other physics

892.639 --> 899.839
related things

902.88 --> 907.12
all right so yeah they're very cute

909.92 --> 916.0
now but salad salad is relatively simple

913.44 --> 918.5600000000001
if it's soup that means that there is

916.0 --> 919.76
a lot of different things in it compared

918.56 --> 922.0
to salad

919.76 --> 922.0
right

922.88 --> 926.16
i'm actually literally making this up

924.72 --> 928.8000000000001
i'm literally now

926.16 --> 931.04
defining arbitrarily the distinction

928.8 --> 932.7199999999999
between word soup and word salad

931.04 --> 934.56
this is how i'm gonna divide it the

932.72 --> 937.36
salad is more simple more

934.56 --> 938.079
twisty interesting looking soup is

937.36 --> 940.0
really just

938.079 --> 942.8
a lot of different as many different

940.0 --> 946.56
things more

942.8 --> 946.56
like scatter gunning

947.12 --> 955.839
with a lot of different information bits

949.279 --> 955.8389999999999
all together and then it becomes soup

957.6 --> 960.72
i don't know i'm literally making this

959.36 --> 962.88
up that that

960.72 --> 964.72
the distinction between the two

962.88 --> 965.12
literally now making it up just on the

964.72 --> 967.6
rack

965.12 --> 968.48
just for the record hey if you like it

967.6 --> 971.44
if you like that

968.48 --> 983.04
that approach then by all means use it

971.44 --> 986.1600000000001
like that

983.04 --> 988.48
that's why it's impossible to apply a

986.16 --> 990.079
refractive index to any portion of the

988.48 --> 993.1990000000001
earth's atmosphere

990.079 --> 996.079
well it's not an atmosphere to start

993.199 --> 998.399
and yeah you can you absolutely can the

996.079 --> 999.519
problem is however is that a refraction

998.399 --> 1001.6
index

999.519 --> 1003.279
how that was established and figured out

1001.6 --> 1006.399
is by

1003.279 --> 1008.72
very uniform

1006.399 --> 1011.68
differences so you have a block of glass

1008.72 --> 1015.12
the glass is going to be absolutely

1011.68 --> 1017.04
perfectly lined up to be having exactly

1015.12 --> 1019.839
the same refraction index

1017.04 --> 1021.12
for such experiments and then the air

1019.839 --> 1024.4
will have to be

1021.12 --> 1026.72
yeah as homogeneous as possible to get

1024.4 --> 1027.76
the refraction index really figured out

1026.72 --> 1030.0
exactly right

1027.76 --> 1032.0
well the atmosphere does not give you

1030.0 --> 1033.919
that luxury

1032.0 --> 1035.679
because it is basically irregular

1033.919 --> 1037.76
because of the size of it

1035.679 --> 1039.439
and because of the the gas pressure

1037.76 --> 1041.439
differentials and

1039.439 --> 1044.16
all the different gases that are kind of

1041.439 --> 1047.199
like in different amounts

1044.16 --> 1049.039
are in the air like moisture is

1047.199 --> 1051.1200000000001
yeah very different levels in different

1049.039 --> 1053.6
locations and that all

1051.12 --> 1056.2399999999998
the view through it it all stacks in a

1053.6 --> 1058.7199999999998
very irregular way

1056.24 --> 1060.48
and yeah it does seem that the

1058.72 --> 1063.679
refraction itself

1060.48 --> 1067.28
causes the miraging effect

1063.679 --> 1070.88
as a secondary to the diffraction

1067.28 --> 1071.6789999999999
limit it's always remember the miraging

1070.88 --> 1073.7600000000002
that this

1071.679 --> 1075.2
always in relation to the horizon well

1073.76 --> 1077.36
the horizon

1075.2 --> 1079.6000000000001
definitely has something directly to do

1077.36 --> 1082.1599999999999
with the diffraction effects

1079.6 --> 1083.36
the bottom-ups disappearance that

1082.16 --> 1085.679
overall effect

1083.36 --> 1088.32
so you could definitely conclude that

1085.679 --> 1092.88
miraging and all that is basically

1088.32 --> 1096.32
refraction that is like a secondary to

1092.88 --> 1096.3200000000002
the diffraction horizon

1096.64 --> 1101.76
no i did not learn no literally i'm

1099.44 --> 1104.0800000000002
figuring it out

1101.76 --> 1105.6
i'm figuring it out from everything

1104.08 --> 1108.799
that's been talked about

1105.6 --> 1111.36
what qe has described the presentations

1108.799 --> 1114.08
about the different forms of miraging

1111.36 --> 1115.1999999999998
and the important things were really

1114.08 --> 1117.36
hammered in there

1115.2 --> 1120.0
by them and i really appreciate it for

1117.36 --> 1122.8799999999999
example yeah you can't

1120.0 --> 1123.84
this there can be no mirage that

1122.88 --> 1127.2800000000002
displaces

1123.84 --> 1128.08
the horizon because any miraging effect

1127.28 --> 1130.72
will always be

1128.08 --> 1131.76
in relation to the horizon that will be

1130.72 --> 1134.64
set

1131.76 --> 1138.4
and that set horizon will be very

1134.64 --> 1138.4
dependent on the diffraction

1141.6 --> 1146.0
so i'm jamming no i'm figuring it out

1146.559 --> 1152.48
and everything about optics is all lent

1150.559 --> 1155.52
from what people have told me through

1152.48 --> 1155.52
what they've studied

1156.0 --> 1162.4
and i just keep hearing them about it

1159.12 --> 1163.36
see how well they have made up their

1162.4 --> 1165.919
mind about

1163.36 --> 1167.1999999999998
things or if how much they are digging

1165.919 --> 1170.64
so there are other like

1167.2 --> 1172.799
optics presentation people out there

1170.64 --> 1174.64
but they're still like kind of digging

1172.799 --> 1176.96
so they can put down a good story but

1174.64 --> 1180.0
they haven't really settled

1176.96 --> 1183.1200000000001
a hundred percent about everything

1180.0 --> 1185.039
in yeah they would like to people to

1183.12 --> 1186.1599999999999
just see like yeah i have a wide

1185.039 --> 1188.16
understanding but

1186.16 --> 1189.8400000000001
it's just so [ __ ] difficult you can't

1188.16 --> 1192.0
just put it all into it

1189.84 --> 1194.1599999999999
one formula and make it always work like

1192.0 --> 1198.08
that

1194.16 --> 1200.16
right because it is really difficult

1198.08 --> 1201.76
but you can have a very broad and

1200.16 --> 1202.799
detailed understanding about the

1201.76 --> 1205.84
implications of

1202.799 --> 1207.36
all the related things that come with

1205.84 --> 1209.12
optics

1207.36 --> 1211.84
like uh what's his name again life is

1209.12 --> 1215.12
short he's one of those guys

1211.84 --> 1217.28
but his work has not really

1215.12 --> 1220.3999999999999
helped me to basically close all the

1217.28 --> 1223.039
gaps and find a uniform approach

1220.4 --> 1224.0800000000002
i've kind of like had to just listen to

1223.039 --> 1226.72
that and see

1224.08 --> 1228.3999999999999
like wow there is so much in there it's

1226.72 --> 1229.28
not really helping me getting a clearer

1228.4 --> 1230.96
picture though

1229.28 --> 1233.6789999999999
because it's just too complicated the

1230.96 --> 1236.64
way it's like too attuned to how he

1233.679 --> 1238.0
has worked on it is too much but i let

1236.64 --> 1240.7990000000002
it sink

1238.0 --> 1242.0
kept on just learning the things that

1240.799 --> 1244.4
were very solid

1242.0 --> 1246.08
like for example there's no miraging

1244.4 --> 1250.48
that can displace the horizon

1246.08 --> 1253.52
itself right those fundamental insights

1250.48 --> 1256.88
integrated them and that's the new board

1253.52 --> 1257.28
on which i can build a framework to have

1256.88 --> 1261.679
a

1257.28 --> 1265.44
more palpable understanding

1261.679 --> 1267.6000000000001
of yeah the optics effects and

1265.44 --> 1277.52
and also a way to explain it and that's

1267.6 --> 1280.559
what i'm doing right now

1277.52 --> 1284.32
so yeah refraction diffraction

1280.559 --> 1287.6
diffraction very different diffraction

1284.32 --> 1289.84
directly related to lensing to

1287.6 --> 1290.9599999999998
the shape of the lens and the eye

1289.84 --> 1294.8799999999999
refraction

1290.96 --> 1296.159
more about light how it travels through

1294.88 --> 1300.0800000000002
material and how

1296.159 --> 1300.64
over a span like the amount of deviation

1300.08 --> 1303.52
will

1300.64 --> 1304.48
cause by refraction stacks until it

1303.52 --> 1308.559
meets

1304.48 --> 1310.64
the blur up limit and then yeah you see

1308.559 --> 1312.1589999999999
basically a background color wall

1310.64 --> 1313.44
because you can't distinguish between

1312.159 --> 1314.72
objects anymore it's just going to be an

1313.44 --> 1317.44
average color and

1314.72 --> 1319.52
even giant object beyond that point even

1317.44 --> 1319.919
though they could perspective-wise still

1319.52 --> 1324.0
fit

1319.919 --> 1325.76
within your site angular resolution wise

1324.0 --> 1327.44
they will not be visible because they

1325.76 --> 1330.1589999999999
will be completely

1327.44 --> 1332.4
blurred into a background color because

1330.159 --> 1334.96
of the refraction

1332.4 --> 1336.64
caused sight limit and the more moist

1334.96 --> 1339.52
for example is in the air

1336.64 --> 1340.159
the closer by this refraction limit will

1339.52 --> 1343.12
move

1340.159 --> 1344.72
it's very clear and very dry also very

1343.12 --> 1345.4399999999998
cold for example it's drier when it's

1344.72 --> 1347.679
cold

1345.44 --> 1348.72
you can see unbelievably far the

1347.679 --> 1351.6000000000001
refraction limit

1348.72 --> 1352.48
almost seems to drop away and it's more

1351.6 --> 1354.9599999999998
bound to the

1352.48 --> 1356.32
angular resolution if you can see things

1354.96 --> 1358.48
in the distance then

1356.32 --> 1358.48
see

1359.52 --> 1363.2
i think we got a subject for today

1364.799 --> 1368.96
i guess i can thank 19a for that

1369.44 --> 1375.8400000000001
for making me correct him on calling

1373.36 --> 1379.12
something terrestrial some terrestrial

1375.84 --> 1379.12
test day an experiment

1383.039 --> 1386.84
the nature of light very much a mystery

1386.08 --> 1390.72
still

1386.84 --> 1393.039
no not so much

1390.72 --> 1395.52
it's not that mysterious it's it is

1393.039 --> 1398.4
predictable

1395.52 --> 1399.039
it just doesn't typically abide by the

1398.4 --> 1402.0800000000002
the

1399.039 --> 1404.64
yeah the other things in physics matter

1402.08 --> 1405.36
is very different from light in so many

1404.64 --> 1408.5590000000002
ways it's

1405.36 --> 1411.039
almost like counter opposite but there's

1408.559 --> 1417.84
no such thing technically

1411.039 --> 1417.84
just very different

1419.52 --> 1426.0
even though rob h that's a reification

1422.72 --> 1428.32
straw man that's not what he says

1426.0 --> 1430.799
doesn't go there now there is an issue

1428.32 --> 1433.12
with literally assuming light is photon

1430.799 --> 1436.32
particles having literal speeds

1433.12 --> 1438.559
slowing down speeding up

1436.32 --> 1439.76
because i think that the photon is kind

1438.559 --> 1442.96
of a

1439.76 --> 1445.039
material reification it kind of

1442.96 --> 1447.2
makes you assume it is like a piece of

1445.039 --> 1451.919
matter in order to make the calculations

1447.2 --> 1454.559
work like that i think it's not that

1451.919 --> 1455.5200000000002
and i've backed up those arguments quite

1454.559 --> 1459.36
extensively

1455.52 --> 1461.679
with constant yeah

1459.36 --> 1462.799
commentary from qe who says it's all

1461.679 --> 1465.52
nonsense and that

1462.799 --> 1466.24
that means i believe that light is a

1465.52 --> 1468.32
wave

1466.24 --> 1470.24
constantly strawmans me with that

1468.32 --> 1471.6789999999999
although maybe now we've figured out

1470.24 --> 1473.679
that that's not what i'm doing

1471.679 --> 1475.679
i hope he stops it because i don't

1473.679 --> 1478.4
assume light is a wave

1475.679 --> 1479.919
wave is not a thing it's not a substance

1478.4 --> 1484.24
it's an effect

1479.919 --> 1484.24
that happens to something

1485.6 --> 1489.76
so yeah if light work to be assumed to

1488.0 --> 1492.48
be a wave then that means that

1489.76 --> 1493.679
light is nothing it isn't anything it's

1492.48 --> 1496.08
just an effect

1493.679 --> 1498.48
that happens to something else so it's

1496.08 --> 1501.84
already ludicrous to even

1498.48 --> 1501.84
think like that

1503.12 --> 1510.9599999999998
light definitely is a thing it manifests

1507.76 --> 1513.919
it travels

1510.96 --> 1515.679
but yeah when it comes to determining an

1513.919 --> 1518.159
absolute minimum

1515.679 --> 1520.24
unit that's where the real problems come

1518.159 --> 1522.88
in and that's also where the

1520.24 --> 1523.76
photoelectric effect proves it is a

1522.88 --> 1526.159
particle is

1523.76 --> 1526.8799999999999
just garbage and i've explained exactly

1526.159 --> 1528.24
why

1526.88 --> 1530.0
does it mean that the photoelectric

1528.24 --> 1530.64
effect doesn't happen it just means that

1530.0 --> 1533.679
it is

1530.64 --> 1536.4
material bound effect

1533.679 --> 1536.72
on which the conclusions are based it's

1536.4 --> 1538.3200000000002
just

1536.72 --> 1539.84
like yeah if you're going to absorb

1538.32 --> 1543.6
light in order to establish

1539.84 --> 1546.32
what the absorbed light supposed to be

1543.6 --> 1547.12
you're going to be bound by the typical

1546.32 --> 1549.2
minimal

1547.12 --> 1551.84
interaction reaction from the material

1549.2 --> 1553.44
you're using it to detect it with

1551.84 --> 1555.1999999999998
so and there's always good if you're

1553.44 --> 1557.679
going to use material to detect

1555.2 --> 1562.0800000000002
something it's always going to be bound

1557.679 --> 1565.679
by the limitations the the atomic

1562.08 --> 1568.559
particle limitations of that material

1565.679 --> 1571.1200000000001
it's just a natural consequence as

1568.559 --> 1573.52
nobody discusses that

1571.12 --> 1575.52
they should because that kind of like

1573.52 --> 1577.9189999999999
undoes the entire assumption that light

1575.52 --> 1582.08
is a specific sized minimal particle and

1577.919 --> 1582.0800000000002
it's not it's ridiculous to even assume

1582.84 --> 1587.12
that

1584.0 --> 1590.159
it's just it's i'm pretty sure light

1587.12 --> 1591.039
by default is infinitely divisible it

1590.159 --> 1592.7990000000002
can split up

1591.039 --> 1594.4
indefinitely it's just that at some

1592.799 --> 1596.559
point it

1594.4 --> 1598.3200000000002
you won't be able to detect it anymore

1596.559 --> 1601.76
that doesn't mean it's not there

1598.32 --> 1604.3999999999999
it just means it's too little

1601.76 --> 1604.4
to detect

1606.64 --> 1610.72
yeah and if you go by that standard then

1609.44 --> 1614.0800000000002
suddenly

1610.72 --> 1616.4
the wave effects to which light

1614.08 --> 1617.4399999999998
seems the wave functions in this case

1616.4 --> 1619.52
seems to be in

1617.44 --> 1620.72
has an influence on the pathways of

1619.52 --> 1622.559
light and all that

1620.72 --> 1625.039
then suddenly that makes a lot more

1622.559 --> 1627.12
sense than to assume oh the particle

1625.039 --> 1628.799
it can go there so it's splitting up

1627.12 --> 1629.6
theoretically and then re-emerging and

1628.799 --> 1632.72
all that

1629.6 --> 1634.8799999999999
science fiction garbage idea no no

1632.72 --> 1636.559
it's it is splitting up because it can

1634.88 --> 1641.1200000000001
indefinitely split up

1636.559 --> 1643.2
and be subjected to these wave effects

1641.12 --> 1645.12
but that's not the light the light is

1643.2 --> 1647.52
not the wave

1645.12 --> 1648.9599999999998
it's wave effects to which light seems

1647.52 --> 1650.8799999999999
to be subjected

1648.96 --> 1652.08
one of them being the diffraction

1650.88 --> 1655.8400000000001
cascade effect

1652.08 --> 1658.96
which i've kind of isolated

1655.84 --> 1660.32
why does light cascade when you let it

1658.96 --> 1663.3600000000001
go through slits

1660.32 --> 1665.6
why does it like material

1663.36 --> 1667.36
material splits up maybe three ways like

1665.6 --> 1671.1999999999998
that distinct

1667.36 --> 1674.7199999999998
light just unlimited

1671.2 --> 1677.039
10 20 times there's no

1674.72 --> 1678.32
possible way to ever achieve that with

1677.039 --> 1681.279
matter i've never

1678.32 --> 1683.76
seen a demonstration that even any say

1681.279 --> 1685.76
of that freaking demonstration no no

1683.76 --> 1687.12
it's just that one little thing look it

1685.76 --> 1690.08
matter it does too with

1687.12 --> 1692.32
maximum of three so it's not the same

1690.08 --> 1692.32
thing

1692.72 --> 1696.64
the fraction cascade with light is

1694.799 --> 1699.76
really unique

1696.64 --> 1699.76
only light

1705.039 --> 1708.399
at least well in a position to matter

1707.039 --> 1710.399
because who knows maybe

1708.399 --> 1713.6789999999999
like radio waves or whatever you're

1710.399 --> 1716.8799999999999
going to do something else

1713.679 --> 1719.3600000000001
might also have diffraction cascade

1716.88 --> 1721.279
ripple in a pond or half diffraction

1719.36 --> 1722.0
cascade but that's because the ripple is

1721.279 --> 1725.44
not the matter

1722.0 --> 1727.44
it's a an effect so yeah there's a

1725.44 --> 1728.559
diffraction cascade it seems to be

1727.44 --> 1731.76
caused

1728.559 --> 1734.1589999999999
seams to be caused by what could be very

1731.76 --> 1735.76
well equivocated with a wave

1734.159 --> 1737.5200000000002
that doesn't mean that light is a wave

1735.76 --> 1740.0
that means that light is subjected to

1737.52 --> 1741.84
wave effects

1740.0 --> 1744.96
and there comes in the mystery of the

1741.84 --> 1744.9599999999998
diffraction cascade

1748.08 --> 1755.6
so yeah that's my theoretical

1751.279 --> 1755.6
research pure conceptually

1756.96 --> 1762.0
with no physical experimentations or

1759.679 --> 1764.24
papers to back me up

1762.0 --> 1765.36
so all the academics out there can all

1764.24 --> 1767.44
be yeah

1765.36 --> 1768.6399999999999
be very happy you all got your papers

1767.44 --> 1770.88
you all got your

1768.64 --> 1772.0800000000002
credentials i got nothing i got nothing

1770.88 --> 1776.0800000000002
but ideas

1772.08 --> 1779.36
and good will and brutal brutal honesty

1776.08 --> 1781.4399999999998
especially towards myself

1779.36 --> 1783.279
and i think i can get a lot further in a

1781.44 --> 1784.48
very short time period than most

1783.279 --> 1787.76
scientists have in their

1784.48 --> 1789.44
lifetime like that i think a lot of

1787.76 --> 1790.72
other people should do that as well and

1789.44 --> 1793.279
just basically

1790.72 --> 1794.24
shred their freaking papers just shred

1793.279 --> 1797.279
it

1794.24 --> 1799.919
say nope let's completely

1797.279 --> 1802.96
do this [ __ ] from scratch it's

1799.919 --> 1809.8400000000001
scientific it should be

1802.96 --> 1809.8400000000001
definitely replicatable

1820.84 --> 1825.4399999999998
um yeah

1823.279 --> 1837.84
i don't care can you alice you're not

1825.44 --> 1837.8400000000001
welcome here

1838.3 --> 1846.819
[Music]

1848.84 --> 1851.84
uh

1854.64 --> 1865.8400000000001
not interested

1876.84 --> 1879.84
so

1881.36 --> 1888.1589999999999
right anyway uh let's see

1884.72 --> 1891.039
yeah nature of light figuring that out

1888.159 --> 1893.6000000000001
ideas with experiments i'm ready for

1891.039 --> 1895.76
that [ __ ]

1893.6 --> 1895.76
but

1897.679 --> 1901.2
yeah i just with the means i have right

1900.559 --> 1904.84
now i

1901.2 --> 1906.96
can't do a whole lot of physical

1904.84 --> 1909.4399999999998
experimentations

1906.96 --> 1911.519
but hey theoretics are cheap as long as

1909.44 --> 1913.76
my brain keeps on going as long as i eat

1911.519 --> 1913.76
right

1914.64 --> 1918.0
don't get delusional then i'm gonna be

1916.88 --> 1920.88
fine now

1918.0 --> 1922.559
i can definitely continue uh building my

1920.88 --> 1927.44
ideas and

1922.559 --> 1927.44
trying them out in my mind simulation

1928.88 --> 1935.8400000000001
and relay my findings and ideas

1947.2 --> 1954.159
yeah but rob h you are already assuming

1951.12 --> 1956.559
that they're all one spectrum that's

1954.159 --> 1958.3990000000001
what you're assuming

1956.559 --> 1961.279
could you prove that could you literally

1958.399 --> 1964.9599999999998
make lower spectrum waves

1961.279 --> 1967.919
and then literally using the same device

1964.96 --> 1971.519
with no other mechanical transition

1967.919 --> 1972.0
amp it up the frequency until that radio

1971.519 --> 1975.039
wave

1972.0 --> 1977.279
becomes light can you demonstrate that

1975.039 --> 1978.399
if you can't then maybe you should stop

1977.279 --> 1982.799
assuming it is

1978.399 --> 1982.799
all one thing it's not

1983.6 --> 1991.84
i think that is a reification by itself

2000.399 --> 2005.84
carolyn cameron i don't know what that

2002.84 --> 2005.84
is

2016.84 --> 2019.84
what

2022.24 --> 2026.32
oh well can you prove that rubbage can

2025.12 --> 2029.4399999999998
you please

2026.32 --> 2032.6399999999999
show me the proof show me the physical

2029.44 --> 2034.96
demonstration of what i just described

2032.64 --> 2036.0800000000002
exactly how i described it to actually

2034.96 --> 2039.6000000000001
prove it is

2036.08 --> 2039.6
one singular thing

2040.32 --> 2043.76
i don't care if you're a flat earther i

2042.0 --> 2045.519
don't care if you're a flex earther

2043.76 --> 2047.12
whatever you are i want to see that

2045.519 --> 2050.159
proof of that claim

2047.12 --> 2053.44
or you need to just stop asserting it it

2050.159 --> 2055.52
doesn't matter if there's no space

2053.44 --> 2057.119
this physics here if you're gonna claim

2055.52 --> 2059.52
it's all one

2057.119 --> 2060.2400000000002
spectrum and then you're gonna get oh

2059.52 --> 2062.56
all

2060.24 --> 2064.56
nitpicky about oh but light is not a

2062.56 --> 2065.44
wave because the rest is a wave like

2064.56 --> 2068.0
it's one thing

2065.44 --> 2070.879
yeah that's presuppositional you're

2068.0 --> 2072.48
assuming it is all a singular thing

2070.879 --> 2074.0
because some people in physics

2072.48 --> 2076.399
department how many

2074.0 --> 2089.839
years ago i've just declared it is the

2076.399 --> 2089.839
same thing

2090.56 --> 2096.7999999999997
oh okay well i was addressing you maybe

2094.32 --> 2098.88
you should prioritize

2096.8 --> 2100.96
are you talking to when you're being

2098.88 --> 2103.839
addressed

2100.96 --> 2103.839
anyway whatever

2117.68 --> 2122.24
yeah well rob h don't don't use that

2120.56 --> 2124.0789999999997
tone against me if you want to have a

2122.24 --> 2128.24
conversation with somebody else

2124.079 --> 2131.52
in chat especially when i'm addressing

2128.24 --> 2133.839
the chat then perhaps you could add

2131.52 --> 2135.599
their name

2133.839 --> 2138.0
to what you're saying in order to

2135.599 --> 2139.599
clarify you are having a conversation

2138.0 --> 2141.44
with somebody else because otherwise

2139.599 --> 2142.839
this happens i've banned people for

2141.44 --> 2145.839
doing that

2142.839 --> 2145.839
okay

2147.2 --> 2151.04
then i'm considering doing that right

2148.8 --> 2151.04
now

2153.44 --> 2159.839
so don't push me

2165.44 --> 2169.28
yeah especially if you're gonna scatter

2167.2 --> 2171.04
gun the chat with separate mini

2169.28 --> 2173.8390000000004
sentences there's nothing more annoying

2171.04 --> 2173.839
than that

2175.68 --> 2179.7599999999998
not here we go again you're fine

2179.92 --> 2187.839
talking about rob h

2194.24 --> 2201.839
ah welcome back how many you

2210.96 --> 2217.119
yeah i agree i

2214.88 --> 2218.88
don't do that and if if there's really a

2217.119 --> 2220.8
discussion that you think is like

2218.88 --> 2222.6400000000003
worthy of pursuing because there's

2220.8 --> 2224.8
interesting stuff coming out then please

2222.64 --> 2227.1189999999997
just

2224.8 --> 2229.3590000000004
don't scatter gun the chat with little

2227.119 --> 2232.079
stupid sentences like five times in a

2229.359 --> 2235.2
row don't do that just put it in a thing

2232.079 --> 2237.8390000000004
and if you can just patience just

2235.2 --> 2240.0789999999997
have freaking patience don't blurt out

2237.839 --> 2243.2
[ __ ] before checking it

2240.079 --> 2246.079
just put it down read it

2243.2 --> 2247.7599999999998
wait think hey is this going to

2246.079 --> 2249.76
contribute something

2247.76 --> 2251.2000000000003
and yeah if you're really if it's very

2249.76 --> 2252.8
specific

2251.2 --> 2255.52
put the name of the person you're

2252.8 --> 2257.599
addressing in it

2255.52 --> 2258.8
if you have a direct question towards me

2257.599 --> 2261.839
everybody already knows

2258.8 --> 2265.2000000000003
you put my name in that sentence

2261.839 --> 2267.44
of course it's logical right so try to

2265.2 --> 2269.359
also do that with the others

2267.44 --> 2271.76
i'm not saying you always have to do

2269.359 --> 2273.44
that every single time but

2271.76 --> 2275.599
especially if you're gonna have longer

2273.44 --> 2277.28
discussions then do try to do it at

2275.599 --> 2285.839
least every now and then or it's gonna

2277.28 --> 2285.8390000000004
get really confusing

2288.96 --> 2293.839
the sun provides the daylight we have

2291.839 --> 2297.2799999999997
yeah is a good question i disagree

2293.839 --> 2300.64
i think the daylight provides the sun

2297.28 --> 2300.6400000000003
we have how about that

2300.8 --> 2305.28
because i think that the sun apparition

2302.96 --> 2310.839
is a secondary effect

2305.28 --> 2313.8390000000004
caused by the daylight not the other way

2310.839 --> 2313.839
around

2321.75 --> 2324.869
[Music]

2329.8 --> 2335.76
[Music]

2342.0 --> 2346.32
what makes me think that well better

2344.96 --> 2349.92
because there is no proof

2346.32 --> 2352.839
it is a physical object

2349.92 --> 2355.839
and it absolutely does respond like an

2352.839 --> 2355.839
apparition

2356.88 --> 2361.8
[Music]

2362.32 --> 2366.0
okay electronic three i have no idea

2365.28 --> 2368.4
about that

2366.0 --> 2370.16
but hey i wouldn't be surprised if it

2368.4 --> 2371.2000000000003
was somewhere in the book of enoch or

2370.16 --> 2373.68
something

2371.2 --> 2373.68
i don't know

2376.72 --> 2380.24
right well good servant it

2380.8 --> 2385.119
it doesn't have a position because it's

2382.64 --> 2389.52
not an object in a location

2385.119 --> 2391.44
radiating light that's not what that is

2389.52 --> 2393.599
it's not an object it's an apparition

2391.44 --> 2396.88
it's a side effect of

2393.599 --> 2398.4
light manifest light manifest

2396.88 --> 2399.92
dielectrics let's just call it

2398.4 --> 2401.599
dielectrics i don't even fully

2399.92 --> 2403.599
understand the concept

2401.599 --> 2405.119
roughly understand it but yeah maybe

2403.599 --> 2408.6400000000003
it's just dielectrics

2405.119 --> 2411.44
light manifesting through the design

2408.64 --> 2412.8799999999997
of the whole thing and just at this

2411.44 --> 2415.92
point it is yeah

2412.88 --> 2417.28
beyond the vert beyond the energy shield

2415.92 --> 2420.079
dome whatever that is

2417.28 --> 2422.079
a flat surface whatever it's going to be

2420.079 --> 2424.1600000000003
that light just starts to manifest

2422.079 --> 2427.599
dielectric it just manifests

2424.16 --> 2430.16
in a very specific way a pattern

2427.599 --> 2431.599
oscillating pattern and the natural

2430.16 --> 2434.0
consequences of being

2431.599 --> 2434.7200000000003
inside of that position where light

2434.0 --> 2438.16
manifests

2434.72 --> 2442.0
at that time will result in you

2438.16 --> 2445.1189999999997
being well lit up by what seems to be

2442.0 --> 2448.16
the sun which is a apparent

2445.119 --> 2450.4
disk a holographic trademark

2448.16 --> 2454.64
a blueprint of what you see when you

2450.4 --> 2454.64
look exactly in the daylight relax

2455.68 --> 2459.2799999999997
into the daylight direction as it is

2458.16 --> 2462.64
manifesting

2459.28 --> 2467.8390000000004
specifically in relation to you your

2462.64 --> 2467.839
exact eye position only

2469.2 --> 2481.839
that is how i see the sun

2488.0 --> 2495.839
don't call me

2525.119 --> 2527.44
huh

2528.4 --> 2532.319
okay doesn't sound too great robert

2534.839 --> 2537.839
stanley

2540.88 --> 2551.839
is that funny getting sick

2554.88 --> 2563.76
jesus is this for [ __ ]

2559.839 --> 2566.7999999999997
electricity illuminating the gases yeah

2563.76 --> 2568.3190000000004
that's how i think it probably happens

2566.8 --> 2571.119
as well

2568.319 --> 2571.52
through some kind of dielectrics it's

2571.119 --> 2574.319
just

2571.52 --> 2575.359
the gas in the atmosphere is being

2574.319 --> 2577.68
electrified

2575.359 --> 2580.88
causing the light manifest as it does in

2577.68 --> 2580.8799999999997
a very specific way

2582.079 --> 2586.0
and it makes sense too because yeah the

2584.48 --> 2589.2
lower down to the ground

2586.0 --> 2591.92
the thicker the atmosphere is and

2589.2 --> 2594.24
also the more the light seems to

2591.92 --> 2595.6800000000003
manifest in relation to higher up where

2594.24 --> 2598.8799999999997
there's less atmosphere

2595.68 --> 2603.359
yet there is not an increase in in

2598.88 --> 2606.48
light interaction over there

2603.359 --> 2607.92
there's other frequencies also over

2606.48 --> 2609.04
there that's what i've heard but it's

2607.92 --> 2612.079
not like oh yeah

2609.04 --> 2615.68
yeah more at less atmosphere so

2612.079 --> 2621.8390000000004
is twice as much sun here no

2615.68 --> 2621.839
just no

2626.64 --> 2630.0789999999997
this less frequency is apparently

2628.8 --> 2634.2400000000002
filtered out by the

2630.079 --> 2637.8390000000004
less pressure gas pressure like yeah the

2634.24 --> 2641.359
less amount of gas pressure up there but

2637.839 --> 2644.0
it's not like the normal intensities

2641.359 --> 2645.52
of yeah the sun output the daylight

2644.0 --> 2646.56
output as they are being absorbed at

2645.52 --> 2649.92
ground level

2646.56 --> 2651.92
like they yeah stack like it's literally

2649.92 --> 2663.839
more of that energy that's not what it

2651.92 --> 2663.839
is that doesn't happen

2680.96 --> 2685.359
yeah don't use sun lotion it's terrible

2683.04 --> 2685.359
stuff

2687.04 --> 2695.359
it's like atomic titanium

2691.839 --> 2697.7599999999998
and that's supposed to block the

2695.359 --> 2698.96
light from affecting your cells by it

2697.76 --> 2700.7200000000003
being absorbed by it but

2698.96 --> 2703.2
yeah as you're doing that the whole

2700.72 --> 2706.3999999999996
thing literally chemically reacts

2703.2 --> 2708.3999999999996
that titanium chemically reacts with

2706.4 --> 2710.7200000000003
your freaking skin and it's extremely

2708.4 --> 2714.7200000000003
bad

2710.72 --> 2715.5989999999997
so yeah if you want to protect yourself

2714.72 --> 2719.7599999999998
against the sun

2715.599 --> 2723.119
i'd recommend aloe vera

2719.76 --> 2724.8
a lot take like a leaf with you rub it

2723.119 --> 2727.92
on your skin as you go

2724.8 --> 2730.48
or you can like take even pills of

2727.92 --> 2733.6800000000003
extract from it it'll help your skin

2730.48 --> 2747.839
just regenerate quicker overall it's

2733.68 --> 2747.839
very good stuff

2767.04 --> 2778.099
oh no i'm running out of tea again

2774.76 --> 2778.099
[Music]

2779.2 --> 2781.52
okay

2783.2 --> 2787.1189999999997
all right also just a basic small

2786.079 --> 2790.8
parasol can do

2787.119 --> 2790.8
it can do all sorts of miracles

2791.119 --> 2803.839
and even look kind of fashionable at

2793.119 --> 2803.839
least for ladies

2814.319 --> 2817.839
hey the miss kang

2842.839 --> 2847.2
hmm

2845.359 --> 2848.5589999999997
i'm having this very weird idea in my

2847.2 --> 2851.5989999999997
mind hey bible literally

2848.559 --> 2854.88
i don't see you here often welcome

2851.599 --> 2855.2000000000003
but concerning everything i've kind of

2854.88 --> 2857.119
like

2855.2 --> 2859.4399999999996
modeled in my mind about the light

2857.119 --> 2861.599
manifest of the day

2859.44 --> 2863.76
and but still the effect of shadows you

2861.599 --> 2867.599
know it's still there

2863.76 --> 2871.3590000000004
so what if if refraction

2867.599 --> 2874.0
indeed as i have presumed causes a

2871.359 --> 2875.7599999999998
limit to the site like causes an

2874.0 --> 2877.119
effective bubble of sight after which

2875.76 --> 2878.079
everything will just be blurred up it

2877.119 --> 2880.8
will be

2878.079 --> 2882.079
inconsequential you will not see

2880.8 --> 2886.1600000000003
anything

2882.079 --> 2890.0
well would that mean that

2886.16 --> 2892.0789999999997
that you could technically even

2890.0 --> 2893.839
that is getting weird not like

2892.079 --> 2894.2400000000002
recommending this but for example have

2893.839 --> 2897.839
this

2894.24 --> 2898.8799999999997
giant saucer i know hanging on balloons

2897.839 --> 2900.72
or whatever

2898.88 --> 2902.559
that you could move in front of the sun

2900.72 --> 2906.0789999999997
that would effectively like

2902.559 --> 2910.8
almost eclipse situation

2906.079 --> 2915.52
but what if you then moved it further up

2910.8 --> 2919.599
in an angular correlation of the sun

2915.52 --> 2919.599
what could there be a point where

2920.48 --> 2925.44
it would technically be so big that even

2922.8 --> 2928.319
at incredible distances you would still

2925.44 --> 2931.599
have it angular you could still have it

2928.319 --> 2934.96
within the resolution of sight

2931.599 --> 2938.8
but it would be beyond the

2934.96 --> 2942.48
sight limitation causing it to basically

2938.8 --> 2943.2000000000003
phase out of visibility but could you

2942.48 --> 2946.319
then

2943.2 --> 2948.5589999999997
just weird imaginations though but that

2946.319 --> 2953.2799999999997
it's like literally blocking the sun

2948.559 --> 2954.96
and then at some point it just visually

2953.28 --> 2956.8
it just phases out and you just see the

2954.96 --> 2958.4
sun again even though it's literally

2956.8 --> 2961.28
going in that direction

2958.4 --> 2963.839
how freaking weird would that be i think

2961.28 --> 2965.92
that that would happen

2963.839 --> 2967.2
i think it would literally block the sun

2965.92 --> 2969.599
until it just went

2967.2 --> 2971.1189999999997
out of visual range and even though it's

2969.599 --> 2973.839
technically still

2971.119 --> 2976.079
right in front of that manifestation it

2973.839 --> 2978.88
has sufficient angular size

2976.079 --> 2980.1600000000003
to stay inside it would just phase out

2978.88 --> 2984.0
of existence

2980.16 --> 2987.04
and it would no longer block the sun

2984.0 --> 2987.04
what do you think about that

2994.079 --> 2997.8390000000004
do you understand what i just tried to

2995.839 --> 3000.96
explain

2997.839 --> 3000.96
feedback would be great

3009.76 --> 3013.8390000000004
all right

3018.0 --> 3027.839
anybody else did get it perhaps

3032.48 --> 3041.839
all right i see i guess you guys don't

3035.359 --> 3041.839
have any interest in that

3048.4 --> 3052.96
oh if i'm talking about something and

3051.44 --> 3054.96
you don't get it

3052.96 --> 3056.16
why do you start talking about other

3054.96 --> 3059.359
things why don't you

3056.16 --> 3060.319
ask me hey arwyn i don't understand what

3059.359 --> 3064.48
you just said

3060.319 --> 3067.52
could you perhaps try to re-explain it

3064.48 --> 3070.8
sorry for yeah

3067.52 --> 3071.359
but serious this is that what you're

3070.8 --> 3074.48
doing

3071.359 --> 3075.68
at school like oh i don't get it well

3074.48 --> 3079.599
i'm just gonna

3075.68 --> 3081.839
play a game on my mobile instead or

3079.599 --> 3084.079
like seriously don't you want to

3081.839 --> 3085.92
freaking get it

3084.079 --> 3088.7200000000003
if i'm explaining something i i don't

3085.92 --> 3091.359
get it or is this just

3088.72 --> 3092.48
bad habit i don't know man but what i

3091.359 --> 3096.24
was trying to say

3092.48 --> 3098.88
is what if you have a

3096.24 --> 3100.16
giant giant sorcerer now i'm talking

3098.88 --> 3103.6800000000003
about

3100.16 --> 3107.04
20 kilometers across for example 20

3103.68 --> 3110.3999999999996
kilometer disc physical yeah

3107.04 --> 3110.4
a mega giant

3110.559 --> 3114.88
ufo whatever the [ __ ] it's supposed to

3112.8 --> 3115.92
be and it's floating and you can keep it

3114.88 --> 3117.92
floating and you can

3115.92 --> 3120.16
make it ascend all the way up to the

3117.92 --> 3122.88
maximum in some freaking way

3120.16 --> 3123.5989999999997
well if that thing could literally be

3122.88 --> 3126.7200000000003
used to

3123.599 --> 3129.6800000000003
just block get in front

3126.72 --> 3131.04
of the sun and despite it literally

3129.68 --> 3133.68
being an object with an

3131.04 --> 3134.4
angular size decreasing because it is

3133.68 --> 3137.04
physical

3134.4 --> 3138.319
absolutely proven and going further away

3137.04 --> 3141.92
trying to stay

3138.319 --> 3143.92
angular wise right blocking the sun

3141.92 --> 3145.6800000000003
in relation to a specific position and

3143.92 --> 3148.319
keep moving in that

3145.68 --> 3150.0
daylight direction in order to stay for

3148.319 --> 3152.079
the observer in that position

3150.0 --> 3153.76
right in front of the sun and because

3152.079 --> 3157.52
it's 20 freaking

3153.76 --> 3158.1600000000003
miles across you're going to be able to

3157.52 --> 3160.319
see it at

3158.16 --> 3162.5589999999997
absurd distances you're just going to

3160.319 --> 3165.599
see it right do you get it

3162.559 --> 3166.4
huge [ __ ] thing you're going to be

3165.599 --> 3169.44
able to see it

3166.4 --> 3173.2000000000003
extremely far away like

3169.44 --> 3173.52
landmark but not just a little tower but

3173.2 --> 3176.8799999999997
an

3173.52 --> 3179.04
entire incredible sized thing

3176.88 --> 3180.96
it's going to go away away well i've

3179.04 --> 3181.44
already explained there is a limit to

3180.96 --> 3184.4
sight

3181.44 --> 3187.04
universal it's caused by refraction the

3184.4 --> 3190.7200000000003
refraction causes at some points

3187.04 --> 3192.8
that no matter how whatever is out there

3190.72 --> 3194.64
not even due to angular size it not

3192.8 --> 3196.6400000000003
being big enough but because

3194.64 --> 3198.72
at some point at some distance the light

3196.64 --> 3200.7999999999997
is just gonna blur up so much

3198.72 --> 3202.0789999999997
you're not gonna see anything anymore

3200.8 --> 3205.44
it's just gonna be a

3202.079 --> 3207.28
average colored soup of background

3205.44 --> 3208.88
you're not gonna be able to see anything

3207.28 --> 3210.96
so what i presume is what if the

3208.88 --> 3211.92
freaking disc to block the sun was so

3210.96 --> 3216.079
huge

3211.92 --> 3218.7200000000003
that at the literal end point off site

3216.079 --> 3221.119
where it's going to hit the refraction

3218.72 --> 3221.1189999999997
limit

3221.28 --> 3224.559
if it's going to be right in front of

3222.64 --> 3228.72
the sun

3224.559 --> 3230.8
at that refraction limit and then

3228.72 --> 3232.0789999999997
still going to be like an eclipse right

3230.8 --> 3235.04
still going to be

3232.079 --> 3236.88
big enough to cover the entire angular

3235.04 --> 3239.52
apparent surface of the sun

3236.88 --> 3241.119
and then at some point if it would move

3239.52 --> 3244.4
slightly beyond

3241.119 --> 3246.4
the refraction limit as it is

3244.4 --> 3248.64
exactly in front of the sun i predict

3246.4 --> 3250.559
that it will literally

3248.64 --> 3252.319
vanish visual it will literally seem

3250.559 --> 3255.119
like it's going through

3252.319 --> 3255.7599999999998
the sun disk it will just disappear out

3255.119 --> 3258.079
of sight

3255.76 --> 3260.4
out of nowhere one moment it's right in

3258.079 --> 3262.8390000000004
front of it blocking it and then

3260.4 --> 3265.2000000000003
it's just visually gone and you see the

3262.839 --> 3269.44
sun

3265.2 --> 3269.4399999999996
that's what i was trying to explain

3272.64 --> 3279.839
did you get it now did i need to explain

3275.28 --> 3279.8390000000004
it again

3285.599 --> 3288.0
all right

3289.359 --> 3292.72
no that's not possible how do you know

3291.04 --> 3295.119
that tiny womble

3292.72 --> 3295.1189999999997
really

3295.76 --> 3298.96
so are you denying that there is a a

3298.4 --> 3302.7200000000003
symmet

3298.96 --> 3304.799
like a sight limit

3302.72 --> 3305.7599999999998
due to refraction after everything just

3304.799 --> 3310.96
averages out

3305.76 --> 3310.96
and blurs up no matter how big

3311.68 --> 3318.0789999999997
are you denying that that that is

3313.52 --> 3318.079
natural to optics because it is

3318.559 --> 3322.48
so yeah i am basically i sketched out an

3321.44 --> 3325.92
outrageous

3322.48 --> 3328.0
setup technically possible

3325.92 --> 3329.76
potentially at some point yeah it's not

3328.0 --> 3332.88
hard to imagine you know

3329.76 --> 3334.7990000000004
movies you we already got that

3332.88 --> 3336.7200000000003
so it's not hard to imagine that it

3334.799 --> 3338.799
could for some reason be possible

3336.72 --> 3341.2799999999997
there's no good reason to do it though

3338.799 --> 3342.48
but it is technically a possibility that

3341.28 --> 3346.3190000000004
we could create a

3342.48 --> 3349.599
hovering object so large that

3346.319 --> 3352.24
it could block the sun

3349.599 --> 3352.96
even at fast fast distances and then i

3352.24 --> 3355.52
wonder yeah

3352.96 --> 3356.48
if it will go outside of the site limit

3355.52 --> 3359.599
will it

3356.48 --> 3360.079
then just vanish just like that and the

3359.599 --> 3361.839
sun

3360.079 --> 3364.0
will suddenly the sunlight daylight will

3361.839 --> 3367.92
suddenly be visible through it

3364.0 --> 3370.48
just like that out of nowhere one moment

3367.92 --> 3371.92
it's the the apparent sun is completely

3370.48 --> 3374.799
blotted out the other moment

3371.92 --> 3377.2000000000003
suddenly you see it again like the whole

3374.799 --> 3379.68
disc thing just disintegrated

3377.2 --> 3379.68
visually

3383.28 --> 3388.4
yeah no [ __ ] tiny wombo if you could

3385.119 --> 3389.92
block the sun you'd be in darkness

3388.4 --> 3393.92
it's only going to be in relation to

3389.92 --> 3393.92
one's very specific position though

3395.119 --> 3401.44
because i think that you don't

3398.16 --> 3402.96
need it to be like a thousand miles wide

3401.44 --> 3406.4
doesn't make any sense by the way it's

3402.96 --> 3410.2400000000002
like half the realm or whatever

3406.4 --> 3413.28
in order to still let it be

3410.24 --> 3417.52
able to block out the apparent sun disk

3413.28 --> 3420.1600000000003
at the refraction site limit

3417.52 --> 3422.16
barrier at that point where it will go

3420.16 --> 3423.68
out of sight no matter what

3422.16 --> 3425.839
i don't think it needs to be that

3423.68 --> 3426.96
insanely big in order to achieve that i

3425.839 --> 3431.119
think that the

3426.96 --> 3433.119
site limit is much closer

3431.119 --> 3435.44
then must take granted for because we

3433.119 --> 3437.2000000000003
all got indoctrinated by heliocentric

3435.44 --> 3440.319
[ __ ] suggesting that you could see

3437.2 --> 3441.839
lights billions and light years away and

3440.319 --> 3445.599
all that nonsense

3441.839 --> 3449.2799999999997
which is absolute [ __ ] it's absolute

3445.599 --> 3452.6400000000003
horseshit it's totally impossible

3449.28 --> 3452.6400000000003
it's just not possible

3453.92 --> 3458.839
because yeah sight limit you can't see

3456.799 --> 3461.28
light that far it's physically

3458.839 --> 3465.2
impossible

3461.28 --> 3475.8390000000004
right anyway i'm gonna run out the show

3465.2 --> 3475.839
i think it's pretty good

3478.48 --> 3484.48
yeah yeah i know there's many

3481.76 --> 3485.44
wasn't it this simpsons where he

3484.48 --> 3487.599
basically

3485.44 --> 3490.4
paid to blot out the sun because it was

3487.599 --> 3492.6400000000003
giving everybody

3490.4 --> 3492.64
like

3493.76 --> 3497.599
solar electric power and he didn't want

3495.76 --> 3500.96
that so he blotted out the sun

3497.599 --> 3503.28
right mr burns that yeah i know it's

3500.96 --> 3504.16
that part of plotting out the sun is not

3503.28 --> 3507.76
original

3504.16 --> 3510.799
at all but in this case i just wanted to

3507.76 --> 3512.88
present it's very specifically

3510.799 --> 3515.119
for that thought experiment that it

3512.88 --> 3517.76
could because of the end of sight could

3515.119 --> 3519.359
literally one moment obstruct all of the

3517.76 --> 3521.44
daylight and the other just

3519.359 --> 3522.88
completely vanished out of nowhere and

3521.44 --> 3524.48
just you would see the daylight right

3522.88 --> 3528.1600000000003
through it again that was

3524.48 --> 3528.16
what that thought experiment was for

3528.48 --> 3531.839
ah thank you retro bill for the 10 super

3531.04 --> 3535.2
it's 10

3531.839 --> 3537.68
super chat donation i would certainly be

3535.2 --> 3540.16
a better use of our money than anything

3537.68 --> 3543.5989999999997
nasa has done for the past 50 years

3540.16 --> 3543.5989999999997
thank you i totally agree

3543.92 --> 3547.119
i totally do agree

3547.2 --> 3550.72
thank you for the donation

3552.88 --> 3556.1600000000003

3579.119 --> 3583.599

3581.28 --> 3583.599
sense

3584.48 --> 3588.4
but anyway do do rogan's up the show and
