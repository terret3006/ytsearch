92.22 --> 94.46
over

97.2 --> 101.93900000000001
but as you can see it's not all that

99.479 --> 103.259
clouded even in a distance except over

101.939 --> 106.82
there

103.259 --> 106.82
there's a bit of blue over there

113.299 --> 118.52000000000001

143.099 --> 149.099
Wednesday the 4th of August 2021

150.42 --> 156.66
a little late as usual it's really

153.599 --> 158.51899999999998
become a common thing fortunately

156.66 --> 161.16
because I was stuck watching our own

158.519 --> 163.64000000000001
Benjamin in this Westworld

161.16 --> 163.64
review

163.68 --> 167.9
really good hard to step away from

169.08 --> 176.0
it's like been listening in almost 40

171.959 --> 176.0
minutes and it's just really good

177.72 --> 181.28
hello return to normal

188.34 --> 193.22
all right how's my sound coming through

190.739 --> 193.22
by the way

195.3 --> 199.86
it's got a weird sensation like my

197.159 --> 202.67999999999998
volume has gone down for some mysterious

199.86 --> 205.34
reason can't really pinpoint it

202.68 --> 205.34
why

206.34 --> 212.18
stone cutting outside

208.98 --> 212.17999999999998
very distracting

215.04 --> 220.67999999999998
it's good okay

217.019 --> 224.959
it's just a little lowest it seems but

220.68 --> 224.959
fine if you guys don't mind

236.879 --> 241.51899999999998
hello

238.56 --> 241.519
Moon Shadow

243.239 --> 248.4
right

245.159 --> 249.659
that low yeah I know but I I don't

248.4 --> 253.4
really know

249.659 --> 253.4
I can do something about it let me check

253.739 --> 256.4
Mike

258.239 --> 262.21999999999997
I can put up the decibels a little

263.94 --> 269.16
this works

265.139 --> 272.54
how's this better same hmm

269.16 --> 272.54
seems kind of the same

274.38 --> 279.71999999999997
let's try this put it up a little how

277.5 --> 283.68
about this

279.72 --> 286.699
should be a little better whatever ah

283.68 --> 289.44
hello snow birds

286.699 --> 292.139
capilacious 420

289.44 --> 294.8
good to see you was quite a lot of

292.139 --> 294.8
people in chat

295.199 --> 302.66
no good servant the new look

299.639 --> 302.66
what new look

305.52 --> 310.08
it's better now good

308.039 --> 313.5
yeah I just put up the decibels I could

310.08 --> 316.21999999999997
put it up even further but it's just odd

313.5 --> 316.22
like why

316.68 --> 321.0
I had some complaints like on other

318.6 --> 326.22
shows

321.0 --> 326.22
as well like get closer to the mic hmm

338.1 --> 342.56
you watch the Monday Big Bear video

342.72 --> 347.0
I don't know why it took so long to

344.82 --> 347.0
watch

347.1 --> 352.68
yeah I didn't really even finish the

349.32 --> 355.4
Monday show entirely just got distracted

352.68 --> 355.40000000000003
I don't know why

357.12 --> 360.38
the thumbnail

361.08 --> 366.96
the new that's not a new look

364.259 --> 370.62
that's my old thumbnail good servant

366.96 --> 372.9
literally just scroll back two weeks in

370.62 --> 375.86
my videos and you'll see that's just the

372.9 --> 375.85999999999996
same it's always been

378.259 --> 383.78000000000003
I'm like temporarily at least

380.819 --> 383.78000000000003
discontinuing

384.24 --> 391.039
the thumbnail

386.46 --> 391.039
thing that I did because it just

392.16 --> 396.53900000000004
came a little bit too hard

394.44 --> 398.71999999999997
when I get inspired again I'll do it

396.539 --> 398.71999999999997
again

400.319 --> 405.139
you like it back to normal okay fine

402.479 --> 405.139
sure

416.28 --> 422.65999999999997
he didn't realize he was so good oh you

419.039 --> 422.65999999999997
just found out return to normal

423.78 --> 429.44
now he's on a really high level

425.599 --> 429.44
including esoterics

429.479 --> 434.4
like in a way

431.639 --> 435.84000000000003
oh Benjamin is explaining much of the

434.4 --> 438.78
same things that I'm trying to explain

435.84 --> 440.69899999999996
except I tend to explain it a little bit

438.78 --> 445.039
more mechanical

440.699 --> 445.039
he's just very good at

445.319 --> 450.24
yeah

447.9 --> 453.96
flow

450.24 --> 455.699
and entertainment it's just like

453.96 --> 457.68
sometimes like I get a little

455.699 --> 462.3
embarrassed when I watch him just

457.68 --> 463.919
realizing how not fluid I am compared to

462.3 --> 466.44
him

463.919 --> 469.79999999999995
and that he just always has so much

466.44 --> 472.819
energy but I I still have my good

469.8 --> 472.819
moments you know so

473.28 --> 479.099
it all is what it is and I keep growing

476.94 --> 481.4
he keeps growing we all grow at our own

479.099 --> 481.4
pace

494.22 --> 498.78000000000003
thanks for what I did with AJ and you

496.379 --> 501.139
yeah of course dude if somebody wants

498.78 --> 501.13899999999995
the contact

501.599 --> 504.56
someone else

504.72 --> 508.259
that I have on Skype I'll just connect

506.819 --> 511.379
you up

508.259 --> 515.1800000000001
it's just the standard service

511.379 --> 515.1800000000001
I really have to thank me for that

515.58 --> 522.0600000000001
anyway have you heard of him

518.58 --> 524.839
did he didn't seem to have responded

522.06 --> 524.8389999999999
just yet

531.18 --> 537.38
like in Skype he did

534.12 --> 537.38
he did read it

537.54 --> 542.16
most of it

540.18 --> 544.1999999999999
but he hasn't really responded yet I

542.16 --> 546.86
hope he's all right

544.2 --> 546.86
anyway

553.86 --> 560.4590000000001
right calculations for 20 yeah

557.339 --> 561.8000000000001
yeah when he was like I can't I can't be

560.459 --> 564.3599999999999
a flat Earth

561.8 --> 566.76
those were some really interesting times

564.36 --> 568.8000000000001
and that's exactly the same that's the

566.76 --> 573.019
period

568.8 --> 573.019
when I first got to know him too

578.519 --> 583.94
dare I say that's when he started to

580.68 --> 583.9399999999999
become really good

584.22 --> 590.12
hmm

586.56 --> 590.1199999999999
hey flatten the Curve

598.08 --> 603.0
ah yeah well said good servant it is

600.42 --> 605.8389999999999
flat in geometric orientation of the

603.0 --> 605.839
Surface by the way

617.22 --> 622.6800000000001
yeah that's right Tom Parker also it's

619.32 --> 625.7
not just his eyes opening he basically

622.68 --> 628.6999999999999
life showed a natural

625.7 --> 631.98
the natural

628.7 --> 634.62
processes that roll out of

631.98 --> 636.54
letting it sink in that like the Earth

634.62 --> 638.519
is flat and all the space and all that

636.54 --> 640.92
stuff is all alive like which is a

638.519 --> 643.26
really heavy impact he basically rolled

640.92 --> 645.24
it out live

643.26 --> 647.1
as he was going through that period he

645.24 --> 649.44
didn't like oh God

647.1 --> 652.019
I'm gonna retract for a month and just

649.44 --> 655.2600000000001
be all like Sleepless and [ __ ] no he

652.019 --> 659.16
just kept on streaming so we got to see

655.26 --> 662.8199999999999
like the live effect as well it was very

659.16 --> 664.98
fascinating and it very gripping

662.82 --> 667.44
because the guy has a lot of energy and

664.98 --> 670.5
when somebody with that much energy goes

667.44 --> 673.2
through such turbo it really Sparks off

670.5 --> 676.26
like really heavy and everybody was like

673.2 --> 678.36
whoa look at this guy

676.26 --> 681.42
what's gonna happen what's what's he

678.36 --> 684.0600000000001
gonna turn into after it's over

681.42 --> 686.399
everybody was looking

684.06 --> 690.079
right

686.399 --> 690.079
Eric was in this chat

694.5 --> 699.14
I bet Eric was laughing at the No Doubt

699.48 --> 704.82
but also Eric you have to don't forget

701.82 --> 706.6800000000001
that Eric was very suspicious still at

704.82 --> 708.98
the time he probably still is by the way

706.68 --> 708.9799999999999
but

709.019 --> 714.92
he was still like uh oh Benjamin

711.66 --> 714.92
Hollywood and

717.24 --> 723.24
but I think that by now like um Benjamin

720.06 --> 728.8389999999999
has manifested himself

723.24 --> 728.839
enough to dispel any like real distrust

730.26 --> 733.7
about that I think

742.44 --> 747.1800000000001
six years ago he said it was flat what

745.86 --> 749.519
he did

747.18 --> 751.8599999999999
did but he probably did it as a joke

749.519 --> 754.7
about it back in the day

751.86 --> 754.7
I'm not sure

769.38 --> 772.92
Eric did what

771.24 --> 775.4590000000001
we're still talking about oh and

772.92 --> 775.459
Benjamin right

779.279 --> 783.079
the joke

780.54 --> 783.079
hmm

809.639 --> 812.3
right

818.339 --> 822.1990000000001
must at the same time Alex Jones had

820.56 --> 825.779
trouble to speak about

822.199 --> 828.8
uh the same yeah but that's been always

825.779 --> 828.8
that sailor

830.459 --> 835.199
Alex Jones has always been extremely

832.5 --> 838.26
repulsed by Flat Earth

835.199 --> 841.079
I think he's still kind of is but his

838.26 --> 843.6
crew is very well aware of Flat Earth

841.079 --> 846.4799999999999
and they talk about it

843.6 --> 849.839
in a much more in yeah in a more

846.48 --> 851.4590000000001
dignified fashion very carefully they do

849.839 --> 853.139
mention it as like yeah it is a group

851.459 --> 856.079
they are researchers

853.139 --> 858.24
right that's very honorable for non-flat

856.079 --> 861.62
Earth is to talk about it like that like

858.24 --> 861.62
Owen Troyer especially

864.839 --> 870.48
and I think even Harrison Smith

867.12 --> 872.279
another uh typical show presenter there

870.48 --> 875.519
that's now standard

872.279 --> 879.32
he also definitely knows don't know

875.519 --> 879.32
exactly what he thinks about it but

879.36 --> 883.16
doesn't talk about it that often

889.62 --> 894.44
be like oh come on

891.6 --> 894.44
completions

896.459 --> 901.68
dude you can't just play a character 20

899.1 --> 903.9590000000001
years long like that

901.68 --> 906.42
it might just look even if it was true

903.959 --> 910.56
he might have started out reborn

906.42 --> 914.4799999999999
rebirthing himself as a new character

910.56 --> 914.4799999999999
but that's who he is

916.92 --> 920.18
that's who he became

929.639 --> 935.54
that she does it on purpose because he

931.92 --> 935.54
wants to be taken no

938.459 --> 944.7589999999999
no that's not the reason the reason is

941.339 --> 947.3000000000001
he loved the dream and he doesn't want

944.759 --> 947.3000000000001
to let go

947.339 --> 952.3800000000001
he wants to go to the Stars he says it

950.639 --> 955.019
on a regular basis

952.38 --> 957.0
right as a virtual end goal and he

955.019 --> 959.759
doesn't want to let go of that

957.0 --> 962.699
like really doesn't it's like ingrained

959.759 --> 966.259
in how he does things so

962.699 --> 966.2589999999999
I think it's much more personal

970.019 --> 974.54
okay hello James Brown what

984.54 --> 988.2199999999999
he had a David Wise on

988.62 --> 992.12
yeah I've remembered that

1002.74 --> 1009.0790000000001
okay capilations for Twitter no doubts

1005.839 --> 1011.48
no doubt sure look if you want to

1009.079 --> 1013.9399999999999
believe with certainty that he was Bill

1011.48 --> 1015.98
Hicks fine like I don't see how that

1013.94 --> 1017.48
really changes anything

1015.98 --> 1019.5790000000001
you know have you ever thought about

1017.48 --> 1021.259
that like how does that even change

1019.579 --> 1023.62
anything how does that make anything

1021.259 --> 1023.62
different

1024.319 --> 1031.299
like Alex Jones literally jokes about

1027.799 --> 1031.299
being Bill Hicks at times

1034.16 --> 1038.919
so like what does it really matter

1046.52 --> 1050.12
oh by the way I have to give a special

1048.799 --> 1052.1
shout out

1050.12 --> 1054.62
well guys yesterday I got so much

1052.1 --> 1058.28
support and I really needed it from

1054.62 --> 1059.78
drunken bullet but also afterward I

1058.28 --> 1062.66
noticed like dank

1059.78 --> 1064.52
he also sent me a pretty sizable PayPal

1062.66 --> 1068.14
it's

1064.52 --> 1068.1399999999999
exactly what I needed

1068.66 --> 1074.059
so I think that maybe with all this

1071.78 --> 1077.48
together all this support now I can just

1074.059 --> 1080.12
go on for like the halfway the mouth at

1077.48 --> 1082.58
least it's really great thank you so

1080.12 --> 1083.9599999999998
much for the support dank and drunken

1082.58 --> 1086.4189999999999
bullet411

1083.96 --> 1089.559
and the other guy who I can't really

1086.419 --> 1089.5590000000002
pinpoint who that is

1090.2 --> 1093.22
donated before

1094.88 --> 1097.0590000000002
foreign

1097.94 --> 1102.799
so thank you so much for the support

1100.039 --> 1106.28
it's like it I've gone through like an

1102.799 --> 1109.16
actual like recovery because of this I

1106.28 --> 1111.76
had a really good sleep last night

1109.16 --> 1111.76
ah

1114.559 --> 1117.1
anyway

1119.179 --> 1122.6200000000001
MK Ultra what

1136.7 --> 1143.26
he leads people this straight

1139.94 --> 1143.26
talking about Alex

1146.72 --> 1153.14
yeah yakka palacious 420 but do you

1150.2 --> 1156.02
agree also that it is being addressed

1153.14 --> 1158.0
Alex Jones has addressed it

1156.02 --> 1159.98
pretty directly

1158.0 --> 1163.16
I don't know if any of you like watch

1159.98 --> 1165.74
Alex Jones like I

1163.16 --> 1168.38
sounds weird maybe but I watch him out

1165.74 --> 1170.059
every day still despite all the

1168.38 --> 1172.5800000000002
influencers

1170.059 --> 1176.48
and some of the nonsense and

1172.58 --> 1179.48
like borderline fear porn I still watch

1176.48 --> 1183.38
it because there's just

1179.48 --> 1186.02
I have to keep track this is

1183.38 --> 1188.8400000000001
trying to put it all together like from

1186.02 --> 1191.78
eight from ten years back

1188.84 --> 1194.1999999999998
on into the future

1191.78 --> 1194.2
all right

1196.7 --> 1203.179
but yeah he he has admitted that it kind

1201.26 --> 1205.22
of was a mistake that and that Trump

1203.179 --> 1207.3200000000002
there's things wrong with Trump like he

1205.22 --> 1210.679
admits it

1207.32 --> 1213.559
but he's also trying to play tactics and

1210.679 --> 1216.0800000000002
say like yeah but he is still the guy

1213.559 --> 1217.28
that could do it

1216.08 --> 1220.3999999999999
right

1217.28 --> 1222.6789999999999
I'm not so certain about that I my

1220.4 --> 1224.1200000000001
distrust towards Trump the ghost a

1222.679 --> 1225.98
little bigger because he's just done

1224.12 --> 1229.82
things that are

1225.98 --> 1232.58
like inexcusable in ways and he hasn't

1229.82 --> 1235.76
really corrected it he's maneuvered

1232.58 --> 1238.72
around it around addressing it and

1235.76 --> 1238.72
that's a problem

1244.7 --> 1250.82
yeah Alex is a big friend of Israel well

1247.82 --> 1253.46
no not not that much a classical

1250.82 --> 1255.799
homeopath he has addressed Israel and

1253.46 --> 1258.3400000000001
the big bad issues with Israel

1255.799 --> 1258.34
right

1258.62 --> 1264.039
like at the time when the uh

1262.4 --> 1267.14
is it

1264.039 --> 1269.84
and the giant bomb went off in Lebanon

1267.14 --> 1270.8600000000001
he even just like blurted out like yeah

1269.84 --> 1273.74
that was

1270.86 --> 1275.8999999999999
probably the

1273.74 --> 1281.179
they did it on purpose

1275.9 --> 1284.7800000000002
like so no no he he is not super like

1281.179 --> 1287.24
secret bro Israel at all

1284.78 --> 1289.3999999999999
but he is nervous of like he doesn't

1287.24 --> 1293.1200000000001
want to obsess over it like so many

1289.4 --> 1295.22
other people do right little Jew bound

1293.12 --> 1297.6399999999999
and it's everything is a Jew

1295.22 --> 1297.64
right

1298.22 --> 1304.0
he doesn't want to go there and he

1300.2 --> 1304.0
doesn't want people to get like that

1310.28 --> 1318.58
Alex is who is Israel oh really who who

1313.82 --> 1318.58
is Israeli Capital Asus 420.

1319.52 --> 1322.36
that's what

1328.46 --> 1333.5
Trump is controlled from the start well

1331.22 --> 1335.659
he it look this is the weird thing Dutch

1333.5 --> 1339.98
sailor and this is like also Alex's

1335.659 --> 1341.8400000000001
theory around it that's like Trump is

1339.98 --> 1345.32
in the system

1341.84 --> 1349.34
he's just doing it his own way

1345.32 --> 1352.24
right but it's not without problems

1349.34 --> 1352.24
and

1360.86 --> 1370.059
yeah it's just over generalizations like

1365.419 --> 1370.0590000000002
but yeah I in a way I would agree

1371.72 --> 1376.58
there there he is like he's sunk too

1375.32 --> 1378.4399999999998
deep

1376.58 --> 1380.36
into

1378.44 --> 1383.24
the culture

1380.36 --> 1385.9399999999998
that surrounds power as well and like

1383.24 --> 1389.78
not in a way that he just wants to be

1385.94 --> 1392.9
part of that Beast

1389.78 --> 1396.02
but like even if you sink into the pits

1392.9 --> 1398.8400000000001
like all that [ __ ] still rubs off on you

1396.02 --> 1402.26
and numbs you down like it desensitizes

1398.84 --> 1404.9599999999998
you and Trump is it blatantly in ways

1402.26 --> 1408.74
desensitized blatantly

1404.96 --> 1410.9
right that doesn't mean that that he

1408.74 --> 1413.799
once

1410.9 --> 1413.799
that system

1414.86 --> 1420.1399999999999
it's just that that that's the places

1417.5 --> 1422.299
where he goes about

1420.14 --> 1424.659
and so he's kind of numbed down because

1422.299 --> 1424.6589999999999
of it

1433.159 --> 1441.1000000000001
okay yeah it's getting a bit boring now

1435.74 --> 1441.1
I I agree with return to normal

1449.419 --> 1456.3200000000002
yes I know cable is just 420

1452.659 --> 1461.24
hence the desensitized

1456.32 --> 1462.62
part and it is a major error like on on

1461.24 --> 1465.08
his record

1462.62 --> 1468.3999999999999
that I don't know how we will be able to

1465.08 --> 1468.3999999999999
correct that right

1486.44 --> 1493.7
poor powerful people in control like who

1488.96 --> 1495.559
who that sailor more powerful who who is

1493.7 --> 1498.2
controlling him right when you're gonna

1495.559 --> 1500.96
say oh he's good like who is

1498.2 --> 1503.919
can you can't you point at it right and

1500.96 --> 1503.919
then we can discuss it

1512.84 --> 1519.02
no no no no no no

1514.84 --> 1522.4399999999998
desensitized does not excuse

1519.02 --> 1523.34
the action calculations for 20. don't

1522.44 --> 1525.679
don't

1523.34 --> 1529.22
start to build that bridge I never

1525.679 --> 1531.26
suggested that right I said it an error

1529.22 --> 1533.6000000000001
but an error is bad

1531.26 --> 1535.64
it needs to be corrected and he doesn't

1533.6 --> 1539.059
seem like he is

1535.64 --> 1541.5800000000002
it's bad like really really bad bad

1539.059 --> 1543.799
enough for me to say like don't ever let

1541.58 --> 1546.4399999999998
this guy in office

1543.799 --> 1550.36
but then again yeah

1546.44 --> 1550.3600000000001
who am I I can't stop that

1550.46 --> 1552.94
right

1554.48 --> 1559.46
I'm just telling you this is what I

1556.94 --> 1562.24
think is happening with him and why he

1559.46 --> 1562.24
is off

1562.46 --> 1568.82
because he is desensitized

1565.82 --> 1570.62
from just the consequences of who he is

1568.82 --> 1573.3799999999999
and what he does

1570.62 --> 1577.52
doesn't mean that he is just all acting

1573.38 --> 1579.38
and he is actually secretly Super Evil

1577.52 --> 1581.679
right that that was kind of the

1579.38 --> 1581.679
statement

1610.46 --> 1616.46
right so yeah we get it yeah we get it

1614.36 --> 1618.08
now and and you guys are now getting on

1616.46 --> 1622.419
my nerves I'm starting to grow in

1618.08 --> 1622.4189999999999
patience because you are squirting

1622.73 --> 1627.799
[Music]

1624.76 --> 1630.5
everything is wrong everything is wrong

1627.799 --> 1633.1399999999999
with me everything is wrong it's all

1630.5 --> 1635.179
wrong it's all evil he is the ant like

1633.14 --> 1637.88
do you think he is the Antichrist

1635.179 --> 1640.1000000000001
because that's the impression from what

1637.88 --> 1642.98
I'm getting from how you're talking in

1640.1 --> 1646.279
chat right now calculations for 20 and

1642.98 --> 1647.84
Dutch sailor do you think Trump is the

1646.279 --> 1650.919
Antichrist

1647.84 --> 1650.9189999999999
is he now

1653.539 --> 1660.44
or are you just getting caught

1656.899 --> 1664.34
in the spell that is him like everything

1660.44 --> 1667.8400000000001
he does is a giant Spell including his

1664.34 --> 1667.84
Consciousness in itself

1668.539 --> 1675.74
yeah everything about him is his spell

1672.559 --> 1679.0
he is a walking spell

1675.74 --> 1682.7
there is a bizarre unique

1679.0 --> 1685.88
consistency and to there is a unique

1682.7 --> 1691.1000000000001
consistency to his inconsistency it's

1685.88 --> 1692.48
all a giant spell he is a living magical

1691.1 --> 1695.3799999999999
troll

1692.48 --> 1695.38
do you understand

1699.32 --> 1704.3799999999999
heavily magical infused troll

1705.919 --> 1713.14
so it's time to stop squirting

1708.44 --> 1713.14
because that means you're Spellbound

1717.559 --> 1721.299
he's part of the Beast system

1721.7 --> 1728.72
part partially sure as I said like way

1725.84 --> 1731.84
back months and months ago it shows

1728.72 --> 1734.059
titled like yeah he's he's just putting

1731.84 --> 1736.22
his roots in the swamp

1734.059 --> 1737.96
right you're supposed to drain it while

1736.22 --> 1740.179
he he went there and he just put his

1737.96 --> 1744.679
roots in there

1740.179 --> 1747.5
right he didn't have his roots in there

1744.679 --> 1750.46
it's another entity

1747.5 --> 1750.46
it's different

1750.799 --> 1755.899
it's weird

1752.419 --> 1758.8990000000001
it's like an internal Beast it's like an

1755.899 --> 1762.34
other Beast is trying to take over the

1758.899 --> 1762.34
steering wheel kind of way

1768.559 --> 1773.1789999999999
Trump is not Jesus oh really Dutch

1771.2 --> 1776.299
sailor really

1773.179 --> 1779.14
wow thanks I wouldn't have known if you

1776.299 --> 1779.1399999999999
hadn't told me

1785.419 --> 1791.6200000000001
I'm not mad at you it's just come on

1788.539 --> 1791.62
look at what you're doing

1814.039 --> 1820.1589999999999
see everybody has an opinion on oh look

1817.159 --> 1823.1200000000001
at you look at you look at how you're

1820.159 --> 1823.1200000000001
all Spellbound

1825.82 --> 1830.539
Can you feel it can you see what you're

1828.62 --> 1833.62
doing

1830.539 --> 1833.62
all Spellbound

1835.039 --> 1838.6
they're all squirting over him

1841.159 --> 1847.5390000000002
yeah just for the record that means he

1844.34 --> 1847.539
wins you understand

1852.14 --> 1856.0590000000002
that means he has a part of you

1856.279 --> 1862.1
right it is very similar fashion to how

1859.34 --> 1863.36
some trolls like to get in my chat and

1862.1 --> 1866.299
then do

1863.36 --> 1868.399
[ __ ] try to make me look ridiculous or

1866.299 --> 1870.62
whatever try to play on my feelings like

1868.399 --> 1874.2199999999998
they are Spellbound

1870.62 --> 1876.5
by me right and they're just

1874.22 --> 1879.019
trying to present it like it's the other

1876.5 --> 1880.76
way around right

1879.019 --> 1883.76
they can't let it go

1880.76 --> 1885.559
they have this distinct opinion that's

1883.76 --> 1886.8799999999999
kind of personal

1885.559 --> 1889.34
right

1886.88 --> 1890.72
that seems to me kind of like what

1889.34 --> 1893.98
you're doing

1890.72 --> 1893.98
some of you in chat

1902.96 --> 1907.64
are the ones who thinks he's independent

1905.24 --> 1910.519
and a rogue player what how is that

1907.64 --> 1912.64
Spellbound I'm just analyzing the things

1910.519 --> 1919.0
that have happened and how he goes about

1912.64 --> 1919.0
and just how things are maneuvering

1921.38 --> 1923.919
right

1930.679 --> 1935.8990000000001
and the whole Rogue Player thing

1934.519 --> 1940.1
as you say

1935.899 --> 1943.9399999999998
that may simply be the format of the ACT

1940.1 --> 1946.76
that he attains within the system right

1943.94 --> 1948.98
doesn't mean it's oh absolutely literal

1946.76 --> 1951.08
might be at times when he actually gets

1948.98 --> 1953.84
into like it may it becomes personal

1951.08 --> 1957.4399999999998
right even the people in the swamp get

1953.84 --> 1959.4189999999999
Spellbound by what he does

1957.44 --> 1962.6200000000001
and then it becomes person then they

1959.419 --> 1962.6200000000001
really hate him at times

1963.32 --> 1969.32
but in other times he just does business

1967.159 --> 1972.14
with all the swamp creatures just like

1969.32 --> 1975.5
that it's already been said right it's

1972.14 --> 1977.539
he does it in his own way and it's very

1975.5 --> 1982.179
uh tough to

1977.539 --> 1982.179
look at it and not get Spellbound

1983.0 --> 1985.899
it's very tough

1990.559 --> 1996.5
yeah return to normal yeah

1993.86 --> 1998.299
that that wasn't actually a joke that

1996.5 --> 2001.38
that's how I would

1998.299 --> 2001.3799999999999
describe him

2002.919 --> 2010.38
like esoterically at this moment

2006.279 --> 2010.38
hello Maddie Young good to see you

2027.22 --> 2029.3990000000001
foreign

2042.659 --> 2048.94
so you say you're not Spellbound yet

2045.94 --> 2052.899
you've attained a position where you

2048.94 --> 2056.7000000000003
feel you are above them and

2052.899 --> 2056.7
you consider them as worms

2059.32 --> 2063.179
sounds like a bit of a reach

2063.879 --> 2069.399
right that that sounds like you've made

2066.399 --> 2070.5989999999997
up your mind about them you see them in

2069.399 --> 2072.8199999999997
a certain way

2070.599 --> 2075.96
and then

2072.82 --> 2075.96
yeah that's it

2078.879 --> 2083.0989999999997
that sounds pretty Spellbound to me

2094.72 --> 2099.2799999999997
people who get their hopes up like Alex

2096.82 --> 2103.02
Jones but everybody gets their hopes up

2099.28 --> 2103.02
at times like why wouldn't you

2110.44 --> 2114.94
you don't consider politicians to be

2113.2 --> 2117.52
worms and more politicians are

2114.94 --> 2121.079
politicians but

2117.52 --> 2121.079
it's it's different

2125.44 --> 2131.82
I mean would you say that

2128.02 --> 2131.82
Ron Paul is a worm

2132.76 --> 2138.119
is he a worm too he is a politician you

2135.94 --> 2138.119
know

2142.06 --> 2144.24
foreign

2155.74 --> 2163.2599999999998
what's the format of where we seem to be

2158.44 --> 2163.26
caught in a talk about Trump and

2163.5 --> 2167.4
Alex Jones a bit

2190.54 --> 2197.32
Oh you mean opium dealers right

2194.2 --> 2199.74
well hopium is just a standard tactic

2197.32 --> 2199.7400000000002
right

2207.64 --> 2212.7
do I vote in the Netherlands no

2213.94 --> 2217.98
no not not at this time

2291.7 --> 2298.68
hmm

2294.52 --> 2298.68
hey drunken world 4-1-1

2304.839 --> 2311.859
six letters and six text messages sheesh

2309.339 --> 2314.2599999999998
uh yeah well I got two letters by now

2311.859 --> 2317.0789999999997
but I'm not throwing them away I'm just

2314.26 --> 2319.2400000000002
keeping them for for the record

2317.079 --> 2322.8590000000004
I haven't even opened them because I

2319.24 --> 2322.859
know it's [ __ ]

2326.619 --> 2332.76
I'm just using it for keeping it for

2329.56 --> 2332.7599999999998
archive purposes

2333.24 --> 2339.04
Rona apps I don't even have a phone with

2335.92 --> 2341.38
apps right it's like oh my god dude oh

2339.04 --> 2343.38
look at oh they have all this [ __ ]

2341.38 --> 2347.079
pre-installed on your

2343.38 --> 2349.6600000000003
phones that have internet capability and

2347.079 --> 2353.7400000000002
they just oh you are being tagged and

2349.66 --> 2354.5789999999997
traced and like oh really well I have a

2353.74 --> 2357.5789999999997
phone

2354.579 --> 2360.04
it doesn't have internet capability and

2357.579 --> 2361.3590000000004
I always leave it at home

2360.04 --> 2364.3
hmm

2361.359 --> 2367.0
I'm not too worried

2364.3 --> 2369.46
and yeah I'm sure it's listening to me

2367.0 --> 2370.839
then again I have a complete computer

2369.46 --> 2373.42
setup

2370.839 --> 2375.2799999999997
pretty sure I'm already being listened

2373.42 --> 2377.82
to anyway

2375.28 --> 2377.82
all right

2382.359 --> 2387.66
but I don't take any Electronics with me

2385.06 --> 2387.66
outside

2416.38 --> 2421.26
that's my favorite oh I'd like to know

2418.66 --> 2421.2599999999998
what that is

2422.859 --> 2429.2999999999997
because I don't I'm not even 100 sure

2425.74 --> 2429.2999999999997
what my favorite color is anymore

2431.38 --> 2435.3
it's been quite different throughout my

2433.06 --> 2435.2999999999997
life

2443.38 --> 2448.319
all right but yeah cavalicious 420 I

2445.9 --> 2451.96
have oh wait already publicly stated

2448.319 --> 2454.24
pretty early on that

2451.96 --> 2456.52
I'm expecting everything I do is

2454.24 --> 2458.14
recorded everything there's no secret I

2456.52 --> 2460.119
can keep

2458.14 --> 2461.859
nothing

2460.119 --> 2464.56
I get the feeling sometimes they're

2461.859 --> 2465.7599999999998
literally recording me from inside my

2464.56 --> 2468.54
head

2465.76 --> 2468.5400000000004
somehow

2469.54 --> 2476.619
but I'm okay with that I can work with

2472.48 --> 2478.72
that you know I'm a paladin

2476.619 --> 2481.859
I'm supposed to be absolutely honest

2478.72 --> 2481.859
about everything anyway

2519.52 --> 2523.78
yeah smart zones sucked the smart right

2522.099 --> 2526.7200000000003
out of you

2523.78 --> 2531.96
this is all smart applications literally

2526.72 --> 2531.9599999999996
make you stupid every every single thing

2532.18 --> 2537.18
because if it is so smart that means

2535.0 --> 2540.099
that it'll take away

2537.18 --> 2543.3999999999996
cognitive function take it over for the

2540.099 --> 2546.94
people right that's even in the concept

2543.4 --> 2550.54
smart devices they take over well if you

2546.94 --> 2553.06
let other things or people take over

2550.54 --> 2554.859
your functions and skills

2553.06 --> 2559.02
then

2554.859 --> 2559.02
yeah you often lose them

2559.48 --> 2562.7400000000002
you lose the skills

2580.9 --> 2583.14
foreign

2589.42 --> 2595.599
wait what you don't know yourself but

2592.119 --> 2599.7400000000002
they know what who are they

2595.599 --> 2603.28
and what don't I know about myself

2599.74 --> 2605.7999999999997
I mean any data recorded complete live

2603.28 --> 2608.1400000000003
rollout data yeah they have a lot of

2605.8 --> 2610.3
data to compare it with and then

2608.14 --> 2613.0
statistically analyze it

2610.3 --> 2616.0600000000004
that doesn't need mean they know more

2613.0 --> 2618.579
about you than you do because for them

2616.06 --> 2620.5
the data is only analyzed through

2618.579 --> 2621.819
cross-reference

2620.5 --> 2623.859
right

2621.819 --> 2627.819
they don't actually

2623.859 --> 2629.5
truly understand spiritual mechanics

2627.819 --> 2631.9
computers don't

2629.5 --> 2634.8
they just cross-reference the data

2631.9 --> 2634.8
that's it

2656.819 --> 2662.5
foreign sure they did

2660.46 --> 2665.26
calculations

2662.5 --> 2668.38
there's been wide protests against 5G

2665.26 --> 2671.76
here in the Netherlands but they kind of

2668.38 --> 2671.76
secretly started to

2671.859 --> 2676.66
screw around with it

2674.8 --> 2680.619
and install

2676.66 --> 2683.2
5G supposed devices

2680.619 --> 2685.119
I know

2683.2 --> 2687.3999999999996
right but it's capability that doesn't

2685.119 --> 2689.5
mean that they're actually using it

2687.4 --> 2693.339
actively

2689.5 --> 2698.339
but I can't exclude that from

2693.339 --> 2698.339
from them actually having used it either

2702.04 --> 2706.14
it's not even related to 5G okay

2712.66 --> 2717.359
so can you explain to me what that means

2715.119 --> 2717.359
then

2717.4 --> 2721.599
Moscow signal capability what does that

2720.579 --> 2724.3
mean

2721.599 --> 2727.5
if it's not 5G I don't know what the

2724.3 --> 2727.5
hell you're talking about then

2730.24 --> 2733.14
hello Nicole

2749.079 --> 2755.1600000000003
gave your name oh thanks

2752.619 --> 2755.1600000000003
foreign

2768.52 --> 2773.98
I mean that should be enough right a

2771.76 --> 2776.2000000000003
couple of words that immediately means

2773.98 --> 2779.4
you know everything

2776.2 --> 2779.3999999999996
when you search it

2798.0 --> 2803.819
okay I'm seeing things about Jakarta

2801.099 --> 2803.819
here

2803.859 --> 2807.06
and Los Angeles

2816.099 --> 2822.48
all right so there's several places

2818.02 --> 2822.48
around the world where they indeed have

2825.3 --> 2830.4
installed this thing you're talking

2828.16 --> 2830.3999999999996
about

2835.119 --> 2841.78
it's called signal now in Wikipedia

2839.5 --> 2845.819
microwave transmission varying between

2841.78 --> 2845.8190000000004
2.5 and 4 gigahertz

2850.18 --> 2855.4199999999996
this is

2852.579 --> 2855.42
uh

2856.059 --> 2861.7200000000003
all right but the whole idea of smart

2857.859 --> 2861.72
cities yeah that that was already known

2876.22 --> 2882.0989999999997
I'm so grumpy now you're just throwing

2879.22 --> 2885.3999999999996
out superficial stuff and then tell me

2882.099 --> 2888.2200000000003
oh yeah I just brought this up now you

2885.4 --> 2890.92
go from scratch dig it out

2888.22 --> 2893.02
while having a live show right you're

2890.92 --> 2895.2400000000002
the one bringing up the subject dude you

2893.02 --> 2898.9
seem to know about this why aren't you

2895.24 --> 2901.18
actually reporting on your knowledge

2898.9 --> 2903.28
it's kind of annoying I'm having a live

2901.18 --> 2906.46
show right now I don't know about this

2903.28 --> 2908.8590000000004
thing you seem to why are you telling me

2906.46 --> 2912.66
no you're just digging up from scratch

2908.859 --> 2912.66
yourself what the hell

2925.92 --> 2933.52
I haven't used a microwave on food and

2931.599 --> 2937.8590000000004
and uh

2933.52 --> 2937.859
must be at least like 15 years

2940.059 --> 2943.26
it's very unhealthy

2975.94 --> 2978.94
foreign

2994.38 --> 3000.119
I'd like to actually when somebody

2997.839 --> 3002.339
brings something up especially when it's

3000.119 --> 3005.1600000000003
supposedly technological

3002.339 --> 3008.5789999999997
I like to get a little bit more specific

3005.16 --> 3010.04
right because I don't just want to play

3008.579 --> 3012.78
in raw

3010.04 --> 3014.7
technophobia right you gotta be more

3012.78 --> 3017.2200000000003
specific

3014.7 --> 3019.7
otherwise it's not very productive to

3017.22 --> 3019.7
engage in

3025.64 --> 3033.48
okay Julio yeah long time no scene

3030.0 --> 3035.96

I guess when the wave hits it hits hard

3192.48 --> 3195.079
man

3196.02 --> 3200.599
All or Nothing is really a pattern here

3199.14 --> 3202.98

thank you very much man I really

thank you for the support

3207.54 --> 3210.8
not the first time

3220.26 --> 3224.599
can I give a tour of the apartment no

3226.68 --> 3232.0789999999997
first off I don't have a mobile camera

3228.9 --> 3235.7000000000003
if I had a mobile camera dude I would

3232.079 --> 3235.7000000000003
just go on the freaking roof

3239.28 --> 3243.42
that's a much more interesting place to

3241.44 --> 3245.339
show

3243.42 --> 3248.78
because it can you can see the whole

3245.339 --> 3248.7799999999997
neighborhood from there

3248.88 --> 3255.0
but yeah no my uh like how exactly the

3252.42 --> 3257.839
internal house looks like that's none of

3255.0 --> 3257.839
anybody's business

3267.78 --> 3275.52
covet not not real yeah return to no I

3271.98 --> 3278.599
saw that and there's others too

3275.52 --> 3278.599
where was it

3279.42 --> 3284.579
there were other places like they're

3281.819 --> 3286.859
literally declaring like this is fake

3284.579 --> 3289.819
there is no virus

3286.859 --> 3289.819
pretty amazing

3295.38 --> 3300.1400000000003
you had Jared Sanford of course we all

3297.359 --> 3303.0
know but to actually have it now

3300.14 --> 3308.0989999999997
becoming an official speaking point for

3303.0 --> 3310.28
people in politics is pretty astounding

3308.099 --> 3310.28
foreign

3345.0 --> 3350.579
well Tom Parker some people like to know

3348.359 --> 3353.0989999999997
every little I don't know I think some

3350.579 --> 3355.799
people might be so weirded out by me or

3353.099 --> 3358.6800000000003
Spellbound that they want to build an

3355.799 --> 3361.559
entire simulation they would like to

3358.68 --> 3363.799
be able to build

3361.559 --> 3366.6600000000003
I don't know

3363.799 --> 3369.0
reconstruct like this building in my

3366.66 --> 3372.319
apartment and everything in my room for

3369.0 --> 3372.319
some video game or something

3373.02 --> 3377.54
probably a shooter video game

3382.68 --> 3386.359
some people are just like that

3386.7 --> 3390.839
right

3387.839 --> 3394.5589999999997
I've seen people do it like with schools

3390.839 --> 3396.359
like in the school where I went it's not

3394.559 --> 3399.3590000000004
functioning anymore as it used to but

3396.359 --> 3402.5989999999997
somebody literally like in

3399.359 --> 3405.48
again in in Counter-Strike use the

3402.599 --> 3408.3590000000004
editor to completely make the building

3405.48 --> 3410.339
with staircases and everything to play

3408.359 --> 3412.319
Counter-Strike in like literally the

3410.339 --> 3414.42
building that we would be sitting in

3412.319 --> 3417.0
behind the computers and the computers

3414.42 --> 3419.339
were literally drawn were literally

3417.0 --> 3421.799
built into the rooms

3419.339 --> 3423.839
that you would be playing in like that

3421.799 --> 3425.04
guy built reconstructed the entire

3423.839 --> 3427.88
building and then we played

3425.04 --> 3427.88
Counter-Strike there

3428.46 --> 3432.059
like with 20 people or more pretty

3430.859 --> 3435.72
amazing

3432.059 --> 3438.96
so people like to do that sometimes

3435.72 --> 3441.18
with I don't know places that Fascinate

3438.96 --> 3442.5
them so maybe that's why everybody keeps

3441.18 --> 3444.72
asking that

3442.5 --> 3447.72
they just want to build their

3444.72 --> 3451.7599999999998
our win living space Counter-Strike

3447.72 --> 3451.7599999999998
level or something

3460.74 --> 3465.319
you're confused well that's your problem

3462.9 --> 3465.319
then

3472.26 --> 3477.78
I don't know with that kind of a name

3475.079 --> 3480.119
Flat Earth train wreck I'm not surprised

3477.78 --> 3484.079
you were confused by

3480.119 --> 3487.4
very basic interface things

3484.079 --> 3487.4
it's kind of in your name

3494.819 --> 3498.799
want to play Flappy Bird

3499.619 --> 3502.2200000000003
oh my God

3511.799 --> 3516.72
right yeah that's this sounds good

3513.78 --> 3518.7000000000003
Nicole that sounds like solution driven

3516.72 --> 3522.8999999999996
thinking

3518.7 --> 3526.98
but yeah it's definitely a hoax

3522.9 --> 3529.5
like what the entire medical world is

3526.98 --> 3531.26
constantly blatantly ignoring is that

3529.5 --> 3534.0
there is no more flu

3531.26 --> 3538.0200000000004
registered right because it's all a

3534.0 --> 3540.839
statistics registry game that's how they

3538.02 --> 3544.44
move things around that's how they do it

3540.839 --> 3547.2
with the statistics they [ __ ] with the

3544.44 --> 3549.059
statistics and they just say oh no flu

3547.2 --> 3551.52
doesn't exist anymore people can't die

3549.059 --> 3555.299
from the flu anymore

3551.52 --> 3558.44
now if they die it's covet

3555.299 --> 3558.44
that sort of [ __ ]

3559.98 --> 3565.079
right and in the future oh they died of

3563.04 --> 3567.54
Spike protein yeah yeah they die to

3565.079 --> 3571.02
covet you know at Delta Brian right

3567.54 --> 3574.2
that's the game so yes it is absolutely

3571.02 --> 3576.66
100 a hoax

3574.2 --> 3579.02
it's a statistics game that's how they

3576.66 --> 3579.02
play it

3591.0 --> 3594.0
antibodies

3597.359 --> 3602.88
what antibodies what what are these

3600.42 --> 3605.46
supposed antibodies to viruses you're

3602.88 --> 3609.119
talking about I don't know any I don't

3605.46 --> 3611.46
think I think that actually the viruses

3609.119 --> 3614.1600000000003
that are mistaken for viruses

3611.46 --> 3615.839
are actually the antibody have you ever

3614.16 --> 3619.2599999999998
considered that

3615.839 --> 3621.72
I don't know about developing antibodies

3619.26 --> 3623.3390000000004
for viruses that seems like a fallacious

3621.72 --> 3625.799
model to me I don't think that's

3623.339 --> 3630.0589999999997
actually possible right yeah you can

3625.799 --> 3631.44
develop antibodies for bacteria

3630.059 --> 3633.059
and all that

3631.44 --> 3636.5
viruses

3633.059 --> 3636.5
really how does that work

3637.38 --> 3643.92
that like and if you take

3641.4 --> 3646.859
what is assumed to be the viruses and

3643.92 --> 3650.16
actually have some kind of development

3646.859 --> 3652.74
of antibodies for it well

3650.16 --> 3654.66
seems to do a whole lot more damage than

3652.74 --> 3656.54
it's preventing

3654.66 --> 3659.359
the condition

3656.54 --> 3661.02
with all the

3659.359 --> 3664.44
vaccinated

3661.02 --> 3666.54
getting hospitalized getting very sick

3664.44 --> 3670.319
the higher the vaccination rate the

3666.54 --> 3673.819
higher the hospitalization rate huh

3670.319 --> 3673.819
that's something that I've noticed

3687.9 --> 3690.44
right

3692.4 --> 3697.02
all right well in a way you know the

3694.44 --> 3701.04
whole covet project is mind control

3697.02 --> 3704.28
project it is a

3701.04 --> 3706.74
Fallen like a legally voluntary based it

3704.28 --> 3709.3390000000004
should be if they move Beyond it's it's

3706.74 --> 3709.339
just War

3710.28 --> 3717.119
it's like a medical experiment but it's

3712.859 --> 3719.0989999999997
also a euthanization of the chronically

3717.119 --> 3721.559
uninformed

3719.099 --> 3724.6800000000003
right that's the game

3721.559 --> 3727.8590000000004
it's very brutal game

3724.68 --> 3732.0
if you don't understand that you can't

3727.859 --> 3733.859
have a vaccination to develop antibodies

3732.0 --> 3737.119
against the virus

3733.859 --> 3740.2799999999997
like even if you presuppose viruses as

3737.119 --> 3744.2400000000002
mentioned through medical literature is

3740.28 --> 3746.3390000000004
real if you can't even understand that

3744.24 --> 3748.6189999999997
well

3746.339 --> 3751.94
then in the game

3748.619 --> 3751.94
you get to die

3754.68 --> 3758.16
right

3755.88 --> 3759.539
if you don't even understand that the

3758.16 --> 3762.66
entire premise

3759.539 --> 3767.46
is completely fallacious

3762.66 --> 3769.64
then you risk participating resulting in

3767.46 --> 3769.64
death

3771.18 --> 3777.0589999999997
right or you'll be seduced for some

3774.599 --> 3778.799
special job or fancy pants that you've

3777.059 --> 3780.42
always wanted to have you worked for

3778.799 --> 3781.88
your entire life

3780.42 --> 3784.6800000000003
yeah

3781.88 --> 3785.94
then you're gonna pay the same price for

3784.68 --> 3790.46
that as well

3785.94 --> 3790.46
that's the game it's a very harsh game

3801.92 --> 3807.48
consent based genocide

3804.96 --> 3810.48
well that that's kind of

3807.48 --> 3810.48
self-contradicting

3819.72 --> 3823.5789999999997
Falls more in the direction of just the

3821.94 --> 3827.0
Giant

3823.579 --> 3827.0
euthanization project

3827.299 --> 3831.44
euthanization of the uninformed

3853.14 --> 3858.18
I'll be another orphan phenomena

3855.78 --> 3861.48
otherwise

3858.18 --> 3865.52
I don't think so return to normal

3861.48 --> 3865.52
like I don't know if you noticed but

3866.819 --> 3872.16
this is not just a generation getting

3869.7 --> 3873.0589999999997
euthanized and then oh yeah look at all

3872.16 --> 3875.7599999999998
these

3873.059 --> 3878.039
kids that are orphans no the kids are

3875.76 --> 3880.8590000000004
getting the freaking things too

3878.039 --> 3884.099
yeah this is not gonna roll out in the

3880.859 --> 3887.7599999999998
same situation I know it is similar it

3884.099 --> 3890.099
is like oh a giant worldwide Devastation

3887.76 --> 3894.2400000000002
of the population

3890.099 --> 3896.1600000000003
or Devastation enough that suddenly like

3894.24 --> 3897.66
things don't really work the way they

3896.16 --> 3899.94
used to anymore there's not enough

3897.66 --> 3901.799
workers the key people are missing

3899.94 --> 3905.28
They're All Dead

3901.799 --> 3908.22
nobody there to replace them

3905.28 --> 3910.559
right that's gonna happen

3908.22 --> 3913.4399999999996
that's where the the whole long-term

3910.559 --> 3915.7400000000002
self-sufficiency project is critical

3913.44 --> 3920.2400000000002
because those are going to be the ones

3915.74 --> 3924.319
that are going to erect the new Society

3920.24 --> 3924.319
that's gonna grow out of this

3938.7 --> 3941.7
foreign

3948.96 --> 3953.18
yes I've seen it return to normal

3953.579 --> 3958.94
yeah I I subscribe to that channel it's

3956.16 --> 3958.94
pretty interesting

3965.099 --> 3969.38
all your saved videos got deleted what

3974.039 --> 3980.5200000000004
yeah well if you're gonna save internet

3976.88 --> 3982.7400000000002
video locations yeah they are taking all

3980.52 --> 3984.42
those videos down quickly if you want to

3982.74 --> 3988.0789999999997
have them you'll have to download them

3984.42 --> 3991.6800000000003
to your computer and preferably not even

3988.079 --> 3993.3590000000004
on your running computer but like take

3991.68 --> 3994.859
them out and put them on a separate

3993.359 --> 3997.0789999999997
storage disk

3994.859 --> 3998.94
that you can disconnect from your

3997.079 --> 4001.1600000000003
computer

3998.94 --> 4003.68
if you really want to keep the evidence

4001.16 --> 4004.52
for the like vaccine damage videos and

4003.68 --> 4006.5
all that

4004.52 --> 4009.02
and the doctors coming out against

4006.5 --> 4013.18
vaccination

4009.02 --> 4013.18
you'll have to download them

4014.24 --> 4020.4399999999996
because everything that's on the web is

4015.92 --> 4020.44
all gonna gonna be gone very quickly

4037.22 --> 4044.66
right yes that's a good idea Nicole

4041.44 --> 4047.0
and I don't know if you have a PC or

4044.66 --> 4048.5589999999997
anything that would be very handy if you

4047.0 --> 4050.299
have to do a little through mobile it's

4048.559 --> 4053.7200000000003
almost hopeless

4050.299 --> 4057.079
every PC then you can just take a

4053.72 --> 4058.7
uh what you call it an external hard

4057.079 --> 4061.4
drive thing

4058.7 --> 4062.18
that you can just plug in with USB and

4061.4 --> 4063.5
just

4062.18 --> 4065.48
click

4063.5 --> 4067.88
the hard drive in you don't even have to

4065.48 --> 4070.52
open up your computer for that that's

4067.88 --> 4072.7400000000002
the most handy way to do it and it's not

4070.52 --> 4076.9
really expensive at all

4072.74 --> 4076.8999999999996
very easy to quickly detach

4077.119 --> 4079.599
anyway

4090.799 --> 4097.04
climate change keeps it pretty yeah they

4094.46 --> 4099.799
try they try

4097.04 --> 4103.159
but like people are catching on that

4099.799 --> 4105.14
climate change is complete horseshit too

4103.159 --> 4107.299
and that

4105.14 --> 4109.06
the execution

4107.299 --> 4113.42
of management

4109.06 --> 4114.859
doesn't really fall into the line of the

4113.42 --> 4118.46
spirit

4114.859 --> 4121.1
of climate change alarmism so that there

4118.46 --> 4123.259
is two-facedness even within the

4121.1 --> 4125.0
suggestion of climate change by the ones

4123.259 --> 4127.04
that are telling us how it's supposed to

4125.0 --> 4130.279
be right

4127.04 --> 4134.299
like they are being absurd Hypocrites

4130.279 --> 4136.9400000000005
and are just blatantly using a scenario

4134.299 --> 4139.58
for propaganda purposes when it's

4136.94 --> 4141.8589999999995
already like everybody that is read

4139.58 --> 4143.719
slightly into whatever event that

4141.859 --> 4146.299
happened like a volcano or something a

4143.719 --> 4147.9800000000005
giant storms and it's just like climb

4146.299 --> 4151.719
change climate change and everybody will

4147.98 --> 4151.718999999999
know like yeah that is [ __ ]

4153.44 --> 4157.94
because such things just happen every

4155.54 --> 4161.08
time and if there is something unusual

4157.94 --> 4165.159
it's much more likely that it's actually

4161.08 --> 4165.159
bizarre weather manipulation

4167.359 --> 4171.859
right so all the climate change is just

4170.179 --> 4174.92
complete hoax

4171.859 --> 4178.88
like there is climate control you

4174.92 --> 4181.159
understand there is pretty much complete

4178.88 --> 4184.159000000001
climate control of the world they know

4181.159 --> 4187.4
how to manipulate it

4184.159 --> 4191.8589999999995
in very in detail they could absolutely

4187.4 --> 4191.8589999999995
mess it up and cause giant havoc

4192.56 --> 4198.9800000000005
but they definitely know how to

4195.32 --> 4201.679
stabilize it all so there is no threat

4198.98 --> 4205.04
from climate change there is no threat

4201.679 --> 4206.96
because it is under control

4205.04 --> 4210.26
see

4206.96 --> 4212.2390000000005
it is completely under control there is

4210.26 --> 4215.900000000001
no threat

4212.239 --> 4217.58
from human activity on the ground and

4215.9 --> 4218.9
their ways of going about in the

4217.58 --> 4221.36
industry

4218.9 --> 4225.159
that could devastate the climate because

4221.36 --> 4225.159
it is completely under control

4230.36 --> 4239.5599999999995
like the only real climate change danger

4234.5 --> 4239.56
is from excessive weather modification

4242.48 --> 4247.879999999999
that's the real climate change danger

4244.699 --> 4250.36
excessive weather modification

4247.88 --> 4250.36
right

4271.46 --> 4277.94
the whole climate change thing you know

4274.1 --> 4281.14
what it is what it is functional wise

4277.94 --> 4282.739
it's a reinvention of

4281.14 --> 4285.820000000001
medieval

4282.739 --> 4288.08
feudal is based on the feudal system

4285.82 --> 4290.719
where you have to

4288.08 --> 4292.94
give Penance constantly

4290.719 --> 4295.52
you have to

4292.94 --> 4299.48
give up something and back then it was

4295.52 --> 4301.64
for God now it's for the Earth it's the

4299.48 --> 4303.08
exact

4301.64 --> 4305.659000000001
same

4303.08 --> 4309.04
mechanism

4305.659 --> 4309.04
same results

4313.699 --> 4320.0599999999995
it's a feudal Penance system

4318.38 --> 4322.64
for the peons

4320.06 --> 4325.219
they have to pay they have to give up a

4322.64 --> 4329.179
percentage to the Lord

4325.219 --> 4332.78
because the Lord is assigned by God

4329.179 --> 4335.78
and God demands tribute

4332.78 --> 4338.739
right so everybody pays their penance

4335.78 --> 4338.739
they must

4340.88 --> 4346.2390000000005
because it's the will of God that that's

4343.219 --> 4346.2390000000005
what it was back then

4346.58 --> 4351.199
now

4348.62 --> 4354.0199999999995
it's you must

4351.199 --> 4356.419999999999
minimize your carbon footprint blah blah

4354.02 --> 4360.5
blah you must work with the big Mega

4356.42 --> 4362.2390000000005
corporations that run this scheme

4360.5 --> 4365.62
it's the same thing

4362.239 --> 4365.62
it's a new form of penance

4369.26 --> 4373.0
I got I hope I got that word right

4382.28 --> 4385.659
yeah yeah yeah yeah

4388.94 --> 4393.58
maybe the word is slightly

4395.0 --> 4399.56
maybe it's off a little but it is

4396.92 --> 4401.78
basically the spirit of it it is like

4399.56 --> 4403.6990000000005
you're the bad man you

4401.78 --> 4407.84
the public

4403.699 --> 4409.4
you have to change your ways for the

4407.84 --> 4413.3
Earth and that that's what it's now and

4409.4 --> 4416.719
back then it's like no no you have to

4413.3 --> 4418.6990000000005
pay for your sins then everybody's born

4416.719 --> 4420.9800000000005
with you have to give up

4418.699 --> 4422.48
percentage of your food that you make on

4420.98 --> 4425.599999999999
your farm

4422.48 --> 4427.639999999999
or of your Commerce you have to pay

4425.6 --> 4429.679
that's what it was back then and then

4427.64 --> 4431.900000000001
they had like the authority from

4429.679 --> 4434.719
theocracy and God

4431.9 --> 4437.42
and now it's like oh it's more called

4434.719 --> 4439.52
indoctrination based and like stories

4437.42 --> 4442.28
convincing you the Earth is alive and

4439.52 --> 4445.52
we're killing her please stop killing

4442.28 --> 4449.239
her leave the Earth alone

4445.52 --> 4450.92
and then Penance is enforced

4449.239 --> 4452.54
through that mechanism through

4450.92 --> 4454.88
corporations and governments working

4452.54 --> 4457.239
together to uphold it as a giant

4454.88 --> 4461.38
money-making scheme because they make

4457.239 --> 4461.379999999999
bizarre amounts of money with it

4461.9 --> 4468.679
and use it to build giant Auto heated

4465.739 --> 4472.879999999999
mansions mansions

4468.679 --> 4475.34
and Villas and use their private jets to

4472.88 --> 4478.52
fly around on a daily basis

4475.34 --> 4480.32
creating more carbon output and electric

4478.52 --> 4484.280000000001
waste

4480.32 --> 4488.38
than any other individual in the world

4484.28 --> 4488.38
like they Pride doing that

4490.94 --> 4499.46
just like in medieval times really big

4495.159 --> 4502.46
ambitious bad churches and Priests would

4499.46 --> 4505.58
literally just make everybody give them

4502.46 --> 4507.199
their gold and then they would like the

4505.58 --> 4510.32
entire church on the inside would just

4507.199 --> 4512.96
be like gold-plated [ __ ] because they

4510.32 --> 4515.679
had ever they wanted to flaunt it they

4512.96 --> 4518.92
wanted to show you like we

4515.679 --> 4518.92
rule you

4518.96 --> 4527.96
it belongs to all to us all of it

4523.46 --> 4531.02
now they do that by having excessive

4527.96 --> 4533.4800000000005
possessions that waste a lot of energy

4531.02 --> 4537.1990000000005
and they want to flaunt it in your face

4533.48 --> 4539.12
while they tell you you must feel guilty

4537.199 --> 4541.219
because you have a little bit of extra

4539.12 --> 4544.54
carbon

4541.219 --> 4544.54
yeah it's what they do

4574.159 --> 4576.5199999999995
okay

4613.159 --> 4617.78
huh

4615.14 --> 4619.34
whose responsibility is it to protect

4617.78 --> 4621.699
their children well how about the

4619.34 --> 4621.6990000000005
parents

4661.58 --> 4664.239
right

4665.179 --> 4669.4
anyway I thought it was a pretty good

4666.86 --> 4669.4
comparison

4672.739 --> 4677.419999999999
then again you know these are

4674.92 --> 4679.82
neo-feudible times it's not just

4677.42 --> 4683.12
something I made up

4679.82 --> 4686.44
the comparison to feudalism in medieval

4683.12 --> 4686.44
times is kind of stunning

4694.219 --> 4697.58
yeah

4695.36 --> 4700.4
hello Paul Connell

4697.58 --> 4702.26
it's been a while yeah yeah

4700.4 --> 4703.04
but not that long like a month or

4702.26 --> 4707.780000000001
something

4703.04 --> 4711.5
you're late tonight tonight you say

4707.78 --> 4715.0
wait are you in Australia or something

4711.5 --> 4715.0
that's evening there

4754.82 --> 4759.219
yes gaining wisdom yeah that's what they

4757.04 --> 4759.219
do

4759.26 --> 4763.34
they take control

4761.239 --> 4766.639999999999
If the parents don't control their

4763.34 --> 4769.400000000001
children then they will seek them out

4766.64 --> 4771.320000000001
and basically give them what they needed

4769.4 --> 4773.42
that the parents didn't and that way

4771.32 --> 4777.0199999999995
they can

4773.42 --> 4782.179
actually get a lot of control over them

4777.02 --> 4785.540000000001
like a lot that's how kids get grafted

4782.179 --> 4787.82
even into Cults and gangs

4785.54 --> 4790.219
because of that effect because the

4787.82 --> 4792.92
parents didn't keep track of what they

4790.219 --> 4795.26
were doing and they didn't give them the

4792.92 --> 4797.84
proper challenges they needed

4795.26 --> 4800.96
to thrive and grow

4797.84 --> 4803.0
and then others yeah dark ones out there

4800.96 --> 4806.179
will take notice of this because it's

4803.0 --> 4807.92
visible when parents don't properly

4806.179 --> 4810.1990000000005
control their kids it's visible

4807.92 --> 4812.3
especially to the Predators

4810.199 --> 4814.339999999999
and I will just see him

4812.3 --> 4816.9800000000005
step in

4814.34 --> 4819.5
and take over the role

4816.98 --> 4822.32
first they become the friend or whatever

4819.5 --> 4824.06
the weird old cookie friend and then

4822.32 --> 4825.98
yeah you meet the friends of the friends

4824.06 --> 4827.780000000001
and suddenly it's like oh wow I feel

4825.98 --> 4828.678999999999
finally like I'm being taken serious

4827.78 --> 4831.739
here

4828.679 --> 4833.92
and that's how parents lose their

4831.739 --> 4833.919999999999
children

4844.219 --> 4851.9
and that's even kind of like a

4847.88 --> 4854.54
not that dark way of losing because it

4851.9 --> 4857.12
can be worse of course but I don't want

4854.54 --> 4859.46
to get into like really

4857.12 --> 4862.0
pits of Hell Darkness

4859.46 --> 4862.0
thanks

4863.3 --> 4867.8
that's it let's stay a little bit more

4865.52 --> 4871.120000000001
pragmatic right

4867.8 --> 4871.12
a little bit more functional

4871.58 --> 4877.78
instead of just giving more material for

4874.34 --> 4877.78
people to score it over

4878.36 --> 4882.28
I think we got enough of that out there

4888.86 --> 4893.38
hey Daniel field

4890.719 --> 4893.38
see you

4927.38 --> 4932.5
you've been swimming a little too much

4929.719 --> 4932.5
what

4953.0 --> 4957.739
hmm yeah material Wallace I think I

4955.94 --> 4959.96
remember seeing that

4957.739 --> 4963.099999999999
it's a long time ago by this five years

4959.96 --> 4963.1
ago dude but yes

4981.88 --> 4985.84
water in your ear okay

4992.239 --> 4999.62
it isn't CPS don't get a dick

4996.98 --> 5001.54
the ritual he's talking about a ritual

4999.62 --> 5002.26
that happening at the Grand Opening of

5001.54 --> 5006.5199999999995
it

5002.26 --> 5009.4800000000005
yeah not the tunnel don't be a dick

5006.52 --> 5009.4800000000005
read

5021.59 --> 5024.729
[Music]

5026.8 --> 5028.8
ER

5035.679 --> 5038.679
foreign

5052.5 --> 5059.38
it's five years ago Nicole

5055.42 --> 5062.86
that sort of [ __ ] happens all the time

5059.38 --> 5065.38
like really really large projects and

5062.86 --> 5067.96
they always have to oh look oh this is

5065.38 --> 5071.5
only possible because of Satan or

5067.96 --> 5074.44
something I don't know man it's just

5071.5 --> 5078.04
just annoys the [ __ ] out of me when they

5074.44 --> 5080.138999999999
do that it's like can't you just

5078.04 --> 5081.34
just do the work

5080.139 --> 5083.5
and

5081.34 --> 5086.1990000000005
you finish it and it's like yeah you

5083.5 --> 5087.94
made it that's good like why the [ __ ] do

5086.199 --> 5091.96
you have to

5087.94 --> 5094.839999999999
put that garbage all over it again like

5091.96 --> 5097.12
oh what you're doing it for the garbage

5094.84 --> 5100.54
for the ACT

5097.12 --> 5103.659
you're saying it is because of that it's

5100.54 --> 5107.0199999999995
just annoying so a lot of work people

5103.659 --> 5109.179
put into that and then they just put the

5107.02 --> 5110.56
nonsense act on top of it and it is

5109.179 --> 5113.5
degrading

5110.56 --> 5115.92
it is degrading to the workers in my

5113.5 --> 5115.92
opinion

5119.08 --> 5121.92
like the meaning

5123.96 --> 5129.639
right

5125.8 --> 5131.62
yeah natural Wallace I remind us since

5129.639 --> 5135.78
you brought it up I don't know what the

5131.62 --> 5135.78
ritual was anymore I forgot

5166.84 --> 5169.4400000000005
what

5171.94 --> 5176.44
what do you mean then you know

5174.1 --> 5178.6
everything that's not what I asked I

5176.44 --> 5181.239
asked you could you please lay out what

5178.6 --> 5183.46
it was can you describe it I don't

5181.239 --> 5186.28
remember the details you brought it up

5183.46 --> 5188.02
I'm assuming that you remember the

5186.28 --> 5191.219
details of it

5188.02 --> 5191.219
for you to bring it up

5192.76 --> 5197.6990000000005
yo Nicole

5195.04 --> 5197.699
disgusting

5225.4 --> 5230.799999999999
I don't think I said it was meaningless

5227.98 --> 5233.739
cappellacious

5230.8 --> 5237.6990000000005
I said it's pointless and it's demeaning

5233.739 --> 5240.699
not saying meaningless D meaning

5237.699 --> 5240.699
degrading

5251.44 --> 5254.799999999999
that's what they do though oh have you

5253.6 --> 5256.719
seen it

5254.8 --> 5260.8
have you seen it with your own eyes

5256.719 --> 5264.1
Nicole have you seen them do it with

5260.8 --> 5266.26
your own eyes to make that claim that's

5264.1 --> 5268.5
what they do though oh you have you seen

5266.26 --> 5268.5
that

5279.76 --> 5283.92
have you ever considered it maybe a

5282.219 --> 5286.36
whole bunch of people out there

5283.92 --> 5289.3
supposedly doing that

5286.36 --> 5292.48
are just making up stories to be

5289.3 --> 5294.6990000000005
interesting in a very sick way

5292.48 --> 5296.5
yeah

5294.699 --> 5300.46
said it

5296.5 --> 5306.159
a sizable amount of times in the past

5300.46 --> 5308.76
most of what satanists do is Bluff

5306.159 --> 5312.099999999999
and you get so caught up by the

5308.76 --> 5314.46
outrageousness of the bluff that you

5312.1 --> 5318.04
forget that they could have made it up

5314.46 --> 5321.04
completely from scratch

5318.04 --> 5324.639
you forget because of the level of

5321.04 --> 5328.0
outrageousness it's part of the magic

5324.639 --> 5330.9400000000005
spell binding

5328.0 --> 5333.46
and you end up squirting all day oh look

5330.94 --> 5336.5199999999995
oh of course they just do that oh yeah

5333.46 --> 5338.34
just imagine the most disgusting

5336.52 --> 5341.5
maniacal

5338.34 --> 5343.3
torturous monstrous thing and just oh

5341.5 --> 5346.06
yeah they do that all they oh did you

5343.3 --> 5349.78
see it or did you read some [ __ ]

5346.06 --> 5352.84
story telling you the torture porn in

5349.78 --> 5355.659
detail and now you're squirting about it

5352.84 --> 5358.42
and echoing it all day when you haven't

5355.659 --> 5361.839999999999
actually confirmed that it's real

5358.42 --> 5364.2390000000005
have you have you seen it

5361.84 --> 5367.12
if you've seen the physical evidence of

5364.239 --> 5370.08
it however horrific it was have you

5367.12 --> 5370.08
actually seen it

5383.68 --> 5387.46
[Music]

5385.179 --> 5389.219
do you know how many people in the past

5387.46 --> 5392.8
and even today

5389.219 --> 5396.42
obsess over horror movies

5392.8 --> 5400.2390000000005
and they would in feeble-minded times

5396.42 --> 5404.6990000000005
actually think that the horror monster

5400.239 --> 5404.699
characters were real and coming for them

5404.86 --> 5410.219
if that would happen with something that

5408.34 --> 5412.96
is admittedly

5410.219 --> 5415.78
officially fictional what do you think

5412.96 --> 5418.179
happens when people make up horror

5415.78 --> 5420.94
stories and then don't tell you it's

5418.179 --> 5423.52
actually made up

5420.94 --> 5426.28
you think that people might over respond

5423.52 --> 5428.38
a little and start to take for granted

5426.28 --> 5430.36
that it's all real

5428.38 --> 5431.86
yeah

5430.36 --> 5434.639
have you ever thought about that before

5431.86 --> 5434.639
ever

5436.0 --> 5442.679
did you not see the trick

5439.179 --> 5442.679
as it rolls out

5443.199 --> 5447.419999999999
for years and years

5448.179 --> 5453.82
you know what the whole witnessing

5450.699 --> 5456.099999999999
aliens and who their aliens and they'd

5453.82 --> 5459.58
secretly tied into government

5456.1 --> 5461.92
well because of the nature what we

5459.58 --> 5465.1
learned about the what the actual World

5461.92 --> 5467.38
is Flat contained there's no outer space

5465.1 --> 5471.46
there's no other planets like that

5467.38 --> 5473.86
yeah we can decipher those things to be

5471.46 --> 5476.02
purely made up right we have a ghee that

5473.86 --> 5478.9
shows us that's all made up

5476.02 --> 5481.719
look at how elaborate that is how

5478.9 --> 5484.0599999999995
consistent those made-up stories are in

5481.719 --> 5485.86
ways it's not all of consistent but it

5484.06 --> 5490.2390000000005
is consistent enough it's like a spirit

5485.86 --> 5491.5599999999995
of it of the story yeah if they can do

5490.239 --> 5494.5599999999995
all that

5491.56 --> 5496.96
then who are you to say

5494.56 --> 5499.360000000001
that that's the only thing oh because

5496.96 --> 5502.2390000000005
you found the key for that you found the

5499.36 --> 5503.98
key for the alien fictional stories

5502.239 --> 5507.459999999999
because you understand it can't be

5503.98 --> 5508.54
possible so that is only the thing that

5507.46 --> 5509.8
is fake

5508.54 --> 5512.139
how about

5509.8 --> 5514.659000000001
the things that you don't

5512.139 --> 5516.58
fully have the key over

5514.659 --> 5519.0599999999995
you're just gonna assume it's all real

5516.58 --> 5519.0599999999995
do you

5545.92 --> 5550.42
you don't believe these movies are made

5548.32 --> 5551.739
up oh really

5550.42 --> 5553.4800000000005
so

5551.739 --> 5556.32
you really think there's a Jason

5553.48 --> 5556.32
Voorhees

5556.48 --> 5561.82
you really think there's the

5559.06 --> 5564.280000000001
his name again

5561.82 --> 5568.84
from Halloween you think that's real

5564.28 --> 5571.48
Nicole so in plain sight those are the

5568.84 --> 5573.400000000001
figures that people have had like very

5571.48 --> 5577.62
serious paranoid delusions over in the

5573.4 --> 5577.62
past is the most well-known examples

5582.58 --> 5590.739
dude you're not starting to make sense

5585.76 --> 5593.26
now Nicole this is not that amusing

5590.739 --> 5595.299999999999
fine

5593.26 --> 5597.6
I'm gonna round out the show pretty soon

5595.3 --> 5597.6
anyway

5627.639 --> 5631.139
okay Nicole

5631.3 --> 5634.08
sure

5638.679 --> 5645.34
I have a pretty weird background

5641.94 --> 5649.719
conspiracy about my own origin

5645.34 --> 5651.400000000001
right it's weird I'm not sharing it

5649.719 --> 5654.219
I know I've hinted to certain

5651.4 --> 5657.339999999999
individuals and oh they take notice oh

5654.219 --> 5660.84
they take notice yeah yeah I know what I

5657.34 --> 5660.84
know but I'm not telling

5661.36 --> 5665.62
it oh actually I don't exactly know what

5663.28 --> 5668.099999999999
I know I have suspicions but I'm not

5665.62 --> 5668.099999999999
telling it

5670.06 --> 5676.0
right but let's just say I'm an elf and

5673.3 --> 5679.6
I'll just stick to that it's good

5676.0 --> 5683.88
because it has a wider cultural context

5679.6 --> 5683.88
that has Associated traits

5683.92 --> 5688.42
and

5686.5 --> 5691.42
it has some interesting spiritually

5688.42 --> 5694.02
occult Nordic roots and that's good

5691.42 --> 5694.02
enough for me

5705.159 --> 5710.28
okay Pocono

5707.619 --> 5710.28
what

5710.34 --> 5715.360000000001
PhD Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny

5713.92 --> 5717.159
all right

5715.36 --> 5719.619
well I guess you could become a

5717.159 --> 5722.08
historical expert and knowing like the

5719.619 --> 5724.48
development of these stories and how it

5722.08 --> 5727.42
is enacted and

5724.48 --> 5729.099999999999
sure sounds really bizarre right but you

5727.42 --> 5731.56
could probably

5729.1 --> 5735.1
become a specialist

5731.56 --> 5736.8
in Santa Claus and Easter bunny culture

5735.1 --> 5739.54
and history

5736.8 --> 5741.9400000000005
I love doing that [ __ ] people like oh

5739.54 --> 5743.199
I'm just gonna say something that seems

5741.94 --> 5745.299999999999
so silly

5743.199 --> 5747.82
there's no way that some yeah yeah

5745.3 --> 5750.28
there's a way here it's me Arwin I can

5747.82 --> 5752.5
literally take the most silly sounding

5750.28 --> 5755.08
thing and actually give an extremely

5752.5 --> 5757.3
serious relevant explanation to it yeah

5755.08 --> 5760.5599999999995
that's what I'd like to do

5757.3 --> 5760.56
I'm weird like that

5773.38 --> 5776.58
that's fine Nicole

5776.619 --> 5782.98
yeah

5779.199 --> 5786.239
I'm just not gonna throw out these ideas

5782.98 --> 5786.239
they freak me out

5786.34 --> 5791.82
like I'll talk about it like in real in

5789.4 --> 5791.82
private

5792.219 --> 5796.719
but just not with some random person

5794.32 --> 5799.239
it'll be somebody that I'll actually

5796.719 --> 5802.8
really have to know

5799.239 --> 5802.799999999999
and then I'll consider it

5807.58 --> 5813.0
are you bowling tonight are you doing it

5810.46 --> 5813.0
I don't know

5814.78 --> 5821.08
maybe Paul Continental depends on

5818.86 --> 5823.86
yeah how the flatter debates are gonna

5821.08 --> 5823.86
unfold Maybe

5835.239 --> 5841.54
like I don't really plan Baldwin ahead

5838.0 --> 5844.06
like he's just always there in a cage in

5841.54 --> 5845.86
Golden cage right

5844.06 --> 5849.46
and

5845.86 --> 5851.92
if there is something for him to

5849.46 --> 5856.4800000000005
some moment

5851.92 --> 5859.32
to come out and be create something

5856.48 --> 5859.32
then he will

5859.659 --> 5865.619
because he's always there

5861.94 --> 5865.619
he is part of me that's right

5867.28 --> 5873.219
he's like a

5869.739 --> 5877.48
a previous sculpture of myself

5873.219 --> 5881.32
that I decided to basically put

5877.48 --> 5883.36
in storage and not throw away right like

5881.32 --> 5886.659
so many people do that they're like oh

5883.36 --> 5888.759999999999
I've grown now I hate everything that it

5886.659 --> 5890.799999999999
was I'm just gonna erase it all and

5888.76 --> 5893.56
pretend like it never happened and just

5890.8 --> 5895.360000000001
focus on who I think I am right now yeah

5893.56 --> 5898.54
I do the opposite

5895.36 --> 5901.599999999999
no I treasure everything

5898.54 --> 5905.38
that I was how no matter how flawed and

5901.6 --> 5907.119000000001
no matter how repulsive

5905.38 --> 5910.54
I keep it

5907.119 --> 5912.699
because as I grow older I see more in

5910.54 --> 5915.4
what it was and why it was and that's

5912.699 --> 5917.879999999999
all extremely important

5915.4 --> 5917.879999999999
foreign

5924.3 --> 5930.58
I'm glad you're enjoying it I'm enjoying

5927.58 --> 5933.639
it too I really like doing the shows

5930.58 --> 5936.4
but I yeah I do need the financial

5933.639 --> 5938.4400000000005
support sometimes and when I feel like

5936.4 --> 5942.219
it's running out or something then I get

5938.44 --> 5945.94
a bit anxious sometimes

5942.219 --> 5948.219
but yeah I've got some great support

5945.94 --> 5950.58
right now and I feel very strong because

5948.219 --> 5950.58
of it

5954.219 --> 5956.94
all right anyway

5963.1 --> 5968.1
be back two minutes and then I'm

5965.44 --> 5968.099999999999
rounding out

6043.8 --> 6046.8
foreign

6058.58 --> 6062.159
distress when the wolves are approaching

6060.78 --> 6065.9
the door

6062.159 --> 6065.9
yeah I know

6066.48 --> 6070.799999999999
it's

6067.86 --> 6073.679
it is annoying though to me

6070.8 --> 6075.54
you know sounds a bit weird but I'm kind

6073.679 --> 6077.04
of a perfectionist

6075.54 --> 6080.46
right

6077.04 --> 6082.5
as I've always had that so when I

6080.46 --> 6085.199
crumble down

6082.5 --> 6088.5
then I feel kind of stupid for it it's

6085.199 --> 6091.919999999999
like why can't I just do what I do

6088.5 --> 6096.36
without the support

6091.92 --> 6099.56
right but it just doesn't work

6096.36 --> 6099.5599999999995
it doesn't work

6106.5 --> 6110.48
all right but I yeah

6110.82 --> 6115.32
since I get support and I have got to

6113.4 --> 6118.0199999999995
support even today

6115.32 --> 6120.5599999999995
it's still working and so that means I I

6118.02 --> 6120.56
keep going

6140.219 --> 6142.88
hmm

6169.199 --> 6175.919999999999
well return to normal or maybe it's just

6172.02 --> 6177.84
the the logistics that are broken

6175.92 --> 6180.36
right

6177.84 --> 6182.04
pretty sure people still want to sell

6180.36 --> 6185.36
and buy things

6182.04 --> 6185.36
it's just that

6185.52 --> 6191.719
in order for eBay to happen and all that

6188.34 --> 6195.360000000001
internet trade people have to actually

6191.719 --> 6198.42
maintain warehouses and do delivery and

6195.36 --> 6200.58
when parts of that break down yeah then

6198.42 --> 6204.119
suddenly there's no it just seems like

6200.58 --> 6206.1
nobody's offering anything for sale

6204.119 --> 6208.5599999999995
because they just

6206.1 --> 6212.4800000000005
they just can't it's not coming through

6208.56 --> 6212.4800000000005
they don't they cannot

6212.58 --> 6217.32
provide the services required to

6214.92 --> 6220.08
actually make that system work

6217.32 --> 6222.96
that's what I think I don't know it but

6220.08 --> 6225.199
I think that could be why return to

6222.96 --> 6225.199
normal

6236.46 --> 6240.179
all right anyway with that I'm rounding

6239.34 --> 6243.2390000000005
out

6240.179 --> 6244.86
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you
