8.17 --> 39.409
[Music]

39.9 --> 47.44
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.66 --> 50.65
early-bird number 168 I'm your host

47.44 --> 54.22
Arwen and before we start the show

50.65 --> 56.11
please subscribe to my channel and hit

54.22 --> 59.17
the bell notification so note you know

56.11 --> 63.37
when I'm going life which is usually 2

59.17 --> 70.15
o'clock p.m. amsterdam time also please

63.37 --> 75.46
share share share the show and yes today

70.15 --> 80.17
is again a beautiful day yesterday was

75.46 --> 87.58
total [ __ ] and to be honest I didn't

80.17 --> 90.97
even go out I just had a day at home it

87.58 --> 93.03999999999999
was kind of nice and calm and yeah was a

90.97 --> 96.19
bit sad not to go but the weather was so

93.04 --> 100.209
cold and moist it wasn't necessarily

96.19 --> 105.19
raining all the time but it just cold

100.209 --> 107.59
and moist and you get sick and my friend

105.19 --> 111.61
did go because she pretty much lives

107.59 --> 113.86
right next to it and we chatted through

111.61 --> 118.6
text messages and yes she did in fact

113.86 --> 122.41
get a call so in retrospect I'm glad I

118.6 --> 125.13
didn't go although I did probably miss a

122.41 --> 128.679
lot of interesting live performances

125.13 --> 130.38
because but the music may not always be

128.679 --> 137.53
exactly to my liking

130.38 --> 141.84
they are usually interesting at least so

137.53 --> 141.84
I just had a stay-at-home day yesterday

145.04 --> 160.72
mm-hmm oh hello Roo if ya sure after I

153.439 --> 160.72
finish up my everything I have done

160.79 --> 168.65
I am now watching Netflix again

166.299 --> 172.64000000000001
Outlander and I'm starting from start

168.65 --> 180.01
and it's interesting because in

172.64 --> 180.01
retrospect I think that I probably

184.15 --> 193.959
what no way it's so weird because I just

189.94 --> 196.69
remember my ex watching that and we even

193.959 --> 203.879
having an argument over it it's so weird

196.69 --> 206.549
but it's not supposed to be of that time

203.879 --> 213.54899999999998
because we were already separated in

206.549 --> 220.65
2014 so it's very odd to me or it just

213.549 --> 223.69
came out like that day and we broke up

220.65 --> 225.19
like two weeks later I think I don't

223.69 --> 230.44
know it's very weird

225.19 --> 235.59
I thought I was do them no no that can't

230.44 --> 238.629
be broke up in 2013 it's so weird how

235.59 --> 246.01
how can I have that memories it's dark

238.629 --> 256.239
world stuff it's weird and I also

246.01 --> 258.669
remember ever seeing a review the

256.239 --> 261.87
Nortons show or whatever that that

258.669 --> 268.26
totally gay but kind of amusing

261.87 --> 272.41
Hollywood show from BBC or whatever I

268.26 --> 275.15999999999997
remember a review from that but how can

272.41 --> 275.16
I remember

278.45 --> 285.34
it's weird anyway yeah enough about that

291.92 --> 300.53000000000003
right okay rule if wants to get in okay

297.41 --> 308.19
sure why not

300.53 --> 310.79999999999995
let's see so far there hasn't been any

308.19 --> 314.389
problem when I'm just thrown out the

310.8 --> 314.389
link in chat so I'll just do that

315.02 --> 329.21
so rule if if you want to join there's

318.0 --> 329.21
the link right

345.08 --> 348.3
[Music]

363.64 --> 370.09
[Music]

365.73 --> 373.26
anyway yeah other than doing that I

370.09 --> 379.11999999999995
don't think I've paid much attention to

373.26 --> 387.52
YouTube a lot did see a couple of things

379.12 --> 391.54
oh yeah just saw a Randy's video right

387.52 --> 394.93
after he uploaded it about a GeoNet

391.54 --> 398.65000000000003
engineering influences in his region how

394.93 --> 406.72
it obscures site and he has a good point

398.65 --> 410.62
there huh I see hoary sheet show did a

406.72 --> 412.54
flat earth versus concave show ten hours

410.62 --> 420.22
ago I totally didn't see that that's

412.54 --> 422.71000000000004
interesting I think all right and yeah

420.22 --> 425.19000000000005
more false-flag stuff again through left

422.71 --> 429.15999999999997
to fill apparently there was a San Diego

425.19 --> 436.69
synagogue shooter who blamed PewDiePie

429.16 --> 443.88000000000005
again so weird why do you always want to

436.69 --> 445.71999999999997
blame him you hello Ruth hello hey go

443.88 --> 448.71999999999997
good night

445.72 --> 453.34000000000003
I think yes it's a quarter past 10:00

448.72 --> 456.34000000000003
how could either yeah what's happening

453.34 --> 458.95
right just going over us through some

456.34 --> 461.28999999999996
streams that I've been watching in the

458.95 --> 465.36
last day because I didn't do a live

461.29 --> 465.36
hangout yesterday took a break

465.78 --> 471.66999999999996
right oh yeah globe busters was there it

469.09 --> 474.25
was kind of good I was very active in

471.67 --> 478.03000000000003
chat for a part of it they always go way

474.25 --> 481.06
too long and I think the first part was

478.03 --> 486.039
kind of annoying but when they got into

481.06 --> 489.279
some relativity material

486.039 --> 490.839
and some YouTube presentation so called

489.279 --> 493.99
science presentation that was

490.839 --> 496.569
fascinating that was quite fascinating

493.99 --> 499.33
to see and I thought they made a good

496.569 --> 503.71000000000004
point and I totally used this it or

499.33 --> 511.389
abused the situation to produce my ideas

503.71 --> 514.779
in chat about light not having a speed

511.389 --> 516.339
to which the yeah the presentation

514.779 --> 518.319
further must seem to agreed even had

516.339 --> 522.3100000000001
references historical wise very

518.319 --> 524.68
interesting and I pretty much spouted

522.31 --> 528.5189999999999
out that light is an infinitely

524.68 --> 531.399
divisible energy amount and it's not it

528.519 --> 534.88
cannot be quantified as a indivisible

531.399 --> 537.279
particle like matter can and nobody

534.88 --> 540.49
responds to that so far like I have

537.279 --> 545.31
literally heard not a single person ever

540.49 --> 547.54
respond to this statement so far and

545.31 --> 551.38
when you say that the the Sun is

547.54 --> 552.91
intangible and I go like what other in

551.38 --> 556.41
what other examples that we have of an

552.91 --> 559.54
intangible light

556.41 --> 563.35
well light is kind of intangible but

559.54 --> 566.319
there is an interaction with matter yes

563.35 --> 569.0500000000001
a lot comes from a source right we have

566.319 --> 573.66
a light source that is not tangible do

569.05 --> 577.269
we know of any well that's the thing

573.66 --> 580.74
it's because I suggest light is

577.269 --> 583.93
instantaneous and infinitely divisible

580.74 --> 587.11
it doesn't really matter what the source

583.93 --> 590.56
is and what the end is it's just there

587.11 --> 592.269
and although it you can say okay it's

590.56 --> 596.38
caused because if you put something in

592.269 --> 600.1
between then yeah you can see where the

596.38 --> 602.5
light still is so but to suggest that

600.1 --> 608.35
it's literally coming from a source

602.5 --> 610.87
suggests a trajectory the actual

608.35 --> 612.4590000000001
ocean-based trajectory idea and I

610.87 --> 615.48
disagree with that I think the

612.459 --> 615.4799999999999
connection is instantaneous

615.83 --> 618.83
I'm sure someone that knows what they're

618.05 --> 621.019
talking about

618.83 --> 623.269
would take issue with it oh there is an

621.019 --> 625.399
entire study presupposition a study

623.269 --> 627.89
based on suppose at speed of light and

625.399 --> 630.2
the glow Buster's talked about this very

627.89 --> 634.029
extensively there was vast amounts of

630.2 --> 636.4100000000001
presentation and an afterthought and

634.029 --> 639.26
responses to it was good it was very

636.41 --> 644.81
good this time so I kept listening and

639.26 --> 649.1
talking in chat and it's interesting to

644.81 --> 651.8599999999999
delve into the micro cosmos and it's

649.1 --> 654.6800000000001
very high also yeah kind of saw the

651.86 --> 657.4300000000001
connection between heliocentric macro

654.68 --> 661.43
cosmos things that are too big to

657.43 --> 664.399
basically size to to reach with your

661.43 --> 666.649
senses and then the micro cosmos which

664.399 --> 669.32
are too small to reach with your senses

666.649 --> 672.769
and the scientists pull the same

669.32 --> 674.48
trickery because yeah the people can

672.769 --> 676.79
sense it so they just have to rely on

674.48 --> 681.29
what the scientists say about it pretty

676.79 --> 687.86
much and so as the micro cosmos so is

681.29 --> 689.779
the macro cosmos as about you almost but

687.86 --> 692.2090000000001
if you think that you make it up or do

689.779 --> 694.52
you think they have some evidence or

692.209 --> 697.459
some reasoning behind yes that well

694.52 --> 700.16
there it's probably originally all based

697.459 --> 703.279
on data definitely there is data that is

700.16 --> 706.91
actual and I can disagree with that but

703.279 --> 710.42
it's the systems they bill to explain it

706.91 --> 712.43
and there's this tendency like in the

710.42 --> 716.779
macro cosmos to make everything into

712.43 --> 719.18
Globes into with a vacuum separated they

716.779 --> 722.24
literally did the same thing with the

719.18 --> 727.16
micro cosmos it's pretty much the same

722.24 --> 729.44
arrangement balls both particles with

727.16 --> 732.29
vacuum in between it like protons

729.44 --> 735.2600000000001
neutrons electrons and the supposed

732.29 --> 738.9699999999999
advocate maybe two it's the same the

735.26 --> 743.0
same system it's the same way of things

738.97 --> 745.07
it's a structural way of thinking yeah

743.0 --> 746.6
same rotation where I think the the

745.07 --> 749.47
consensus now is that they're not little

746.6 --> 755.839
balls of stuff

749.47 --> 759.5790000000001
well electrons we have or there's a lot

755.839 --> 762.9490000000001
of thinking and reasoning about

759.579 --> 766.6289999999999
electrons how would the elect what is it

762.949 --> 768.829
the particle and the magnetic field

766.629 --> 770.749
interaction that they're both pretty

768.829 --> 776.329
much the same thing in different states

770.749 --> 778.879
there's that and so there's a lot of new

776.329 --> 783.29
developments from the independent sector

778.879 --> 786.529
pretty much in this but concerning

783.29 --> 789.889
classical mechanics classical physics

786.529 --> 792.41
it's all still regarded as particles and

789.889 --> 795.47
that's also for pragmatic reasons

792.41 --> 799.519
because when you go into calculations or

795.47 --> 802.249
for example chemistry setups then it's

799.519 --> 804.019
very convenient and it always works and

802.249 --> 805.999
here you get with the pragmatism again

804.019 --> 808.61
just like with gravity it always works

805.999 --> 811.399
it works out when you apply it so why

808.61 --> 814.4590000000001
would you then not believe it see it's a

811.399 --> 816.639
it's inherent to human nature to think

814.459 --> 820.8499999999999
like this if it works why would you

816.639 --> 824.569
disagree see ya Newtonian Newtonian

820.85 --> 828.889
physics works right indeed but because

824.569 --> 831.9799999999999
it works like when you apply things

828.889 --> 833.869
using that type of thinking does it mean

831.98 --> 836.6
that that is actually what's going on

833.869 --> 840.649
necessarily no and you look at that in

836.6 --> 844.5400000000001
the details and that is where I start to

840.649 --> 848.42
draw doubt into is light for example a

844.54 --> 851.11
indivisible unit you want a unit of

848.42 --> 855.319
energy or could you for example have a

851.11 --> 859.069
registry of one and a half of that

855.319 --> 861.91
minimum quanta energy particle because

859.069 --> 865.549
that would mean that it is a divisible

861.91 --> 868.04
it's not a unit based you don't have one

865.549 --> 871.85
particle and or two particles and

868.04 --> 874.129
nothing in between in a single registry

871.85 --> 876.47
see and this is this is just going

874.129 --> 880.61
deeper into the material or into the

876.47 --> 881.7900000000001
light in this case I haven't studied

880.61 --> 885.33
that [ __ ]

881.79 --> 887.43
decade at least well I remembered

885.33 --> 889.85
thinking about this and discussing this

887.43 --> 891.5999999999999
I think with my brother back in today

889.85 --> 893.58
eventually everybody got a headache

891.6 --> 897.3000000000001
because I started to ask such detailed

893.58 --> 899.1600000000001
question that generally at that time at

897.3 --> 904.1999999999999
least wasn't available it wasn't like on

899.16 --> 905.79
the internet yet so it got upon some

904.2 --> 907.8900000000001
experts somewhere and then put it to

905.79 --> 910.3199999999999
them I'm sure that sure they'll say it

907.89 --> 912.06
straight out right but I'll need

910.32 --> 916.2
somebody that's not just purely a

912.06 --> 919.8299999999999
theories but that is actually done data

916.2 --> 922.23
research that has done particle testing

919.83 --> 925.26
because those are the people that get

922.23 --> 927.62
the actual data the raw data underneath

925.26 --> 930.51
their eyes and they understand how

927.62 --> 934.32
things are supposed to be interpreted

930.51 --> 935.91
and they could have drawn doubts in that

934.32 --> 937.5600000000001
they're just following the system but

935.91 --> 940.86
they may have their own ideas and just

937.56 --> 946.0799999999999
very curious to see what they would

940.86 --> 947.82
think about my ideas about light because

946.08 --> 950.34
I think there are still just a lot up

947.82 --> 953.7900000000001
for debate it's just that the path has

950.34 --> 958.38
been set for what is supposed to be in

953.79 --> 961.0799999999999
the science in a teaching because she to

958.38 --> 963.18
teach so many conflicting theories that

961.08 --> 965.85
completely go off in their own

963.18 --> 968.0699999999999
directions in a single textbook it's

965.85 --> 970.23
very tough for children like a

968.07 --> 972.72
university person could probably handle

970.23 --> 975.87
that that is much more mature but so

972.72 --> 977.73
they always keep one narrative line to

975.87 --> 980.64
keep things simple enough in order for

977.73 --> 985.7
kids to be able to just handle it but in

980.64 --> 989.4
reality there is actually not that set

985.7 --> 993.09
it's all about pragmatic influences

989.4 --> 996.99
sorry for rambling all the rip I'll let

993.09 --> 1001.07
you say what's going what's happening

996.99 --> 1005.1800000000001
York leathers ahh lots lots of things I

1001.07 --> 1007.19
think what do you think of corner raisa

1005.18 --> 1009.2299999999999
measuring the elevation at one end of

1007.19 --> 1013.72
life want to try into the other and say

1009.23 --> 1015.46
no more field tests right no no no like

1013.72 --> 1017.6800000000001
he literally went on Google Earth and

1015.46 --> 1019.7800000000001
pointed his cursor at one end of the

1017.68 --> 1022.9
bridge and it was five feet or something

1019.78 --> 1024.22
and then pointed his cursor at the other

1022.9 --> 1027.1
end the northern end and said oh it's

1024.22 --> 1032.01
five feet as well therefore the earth is

1027.1 --> 1032.01
flat okay Nathan agreed I think as well

1032.52 --> 1037.66
right I well you'd have to

1035.62 --> 1039.579
cross-reference with how much curvature

1037.66 --> 1041.5600000000002
is supposed to be in the way I guess I

1039.579 --> 1043.93
don't know if they did that I haven't

1041.56 --> 1049.54
paid direct attention to that part okay

1043.93 --> 1051.1200000000001
was it my scream from when someone made

1049.54 --> 1056.17
a video about it the other day no sort

1051.12 --> 1059.7099999999998
yesterday a couple of days ago yeah

1056.17 --> 1061.54
figured it was but they just

1059.71 --> 1065.08
fundamentally don't understand what

1061.54 --> 1068.05
elevation means and that was call me

1065.08 --> 1070.21
cool yeah it's probably not the problem

1068.05 --> 1073.3
but look there's a lot of people out

1070.21 --> 1076.08
there flat earthers and not all of them

1073.3 --> 1079.27
but it's just a lot of people in general

1076.08 --> 1081.3999999999999
that tend to like kind of jump to the

1079.27 --> 1083.71
conclusion because getting into all the

1081.4 --> 1087.97
details like on a rumpus level for

1083.71 --> 1090.82
example it's just way too hard so yeah

1087.97 --> 1093.58
you know yeah you can get all nitpicky

1090.82 --> 1098.4099999999999
about it but but you understand that

1093.58 --> 1101.71
like an area with the same elevation

1098.41 --> 1104.26
that area on a globe is a curb surface

1101.71 --> 1107.97
and that area on a flat plane is a flat

1104.26 --> 1107.97
plane do you understand that

1108.25 --> 1116.29
I don't well I guess yeah okay they're

1114.31 --> 1119.56
in there in lies the ridiculousness of

1116.29 --> 1121.0
what quantum eraser did okay dad that

1119.56 --> 1127.06
doesn't make any sense to me

1121.0 --> 1130.81
the comparison on a globe on a sphere

1127.06 --> 1133.99
yeah an area so an area of water or

1130.81 --> 1138.46
whatever an area with the same elevation

1133.99 --> 1141.97
of throughout is a curved surface on a

1138.46 --> 1144.52
globe right yes

1141.97 --> 1147.68
so relation to the supposed center of

1144.52 --> 1150.59
the earth correct so do you understand

1147.68 --> 1152.03
it's ridiculous to go or one end of Lake

1150.59 --> 1155.1499999999999
Pontchartrain is five feet and the other

1152.03 --> 1159.68
end is 5 feet and infer that the world

1155.15 --> 1162.8600000000001
is flat well I think that has to do with

1159.68 --> 1167.5700000000002
look if it's 5 feet high in relation to

1162.86 --> 1170.9599999999998
the ocean then we could or using the are

1167.57 --> 1173.72
based assumption see how much of the

1170.96 --> 1175.52
water should be in between and I think

1173.72 --> 1179.27
that's what their point is because if

1175.52 --> 1181.36
you can see both 5 feet heights from if

1179.27 --> 1184.8799999999999
you in relation to one another without a

1181.36 --> 1189.59
water curvature in interrupting that

1184.88 --> 1191.72
then obviously you know well that that

1189.59 --> 1193.9599999999998
does kind of proof that it's not

1191.72 --> 1197.21
scientifically though but it proves

1193.96 --> 1200.0
geometrically deduced that it must be

1197.21 --> 1202.64
flat or at least not the presumed amount

1200.0 --> 1205.4
of curvature as is if you can say that

1202.64 --> 1207.3500000000001
but that's not what he did he just

1205.4 --> 1209.93
literally said one end is five feet and

1207.35 --> 1214.9399999999998
the other end is five feet okay 90 goes

1209.93 --> 1218.65
yep that I don't see what's a problem

1214.94 --> 1222.04
really let's see the issue here

1218.65 --> 1226.91
elevation is relative to sea level yeah

1222.04 --> 1228.02
yeah on a globe sea level is a curve I

1226.91 --> 1231.38
know right

1228.02 --> 1232.61
right so saying that one end is five

1231.38 --> 1234.95
foot and the other end is five foot

1232.61 --> 1236.87
doesn't tell you either way whether the

1234.95 --> 1238.94
earth is a globe or flat well it depends

1236.87 --> 1240.55
on how much distance is in between but

1238.94 --> 1242.0900000000001
after a certain amount of distance

1240.55 --> 1244.3899999999999
pardon

1242.09 --> 1246.9199999999998
there should be curvature in the way

1244.39 --> 1248.3600000000001
yeah no you and you're overlooking that

1246.92 --> 1249.95
yeah but just because he doesn't say

1248.36 --> 1252.4699999999998
that doesn't mean that that's not the

1249.95 --> 1255.5900000000001
case that's being pedantic that's being

1252.47 --> 1258.98
severely pedantic I saw the video it's

1255.59 --> 1261.23
being pedantic in a losing position and

1258.98 --> 1265.21
someone in check posted video surely

1261.23 --> 1266.9
someone knows where it was I don't know

1265.21 --> 1270.44
it was hilarious

1266.9 --> 1275.51
anyway it was as bad as how do you can

1270.44 --> 1278.2
both meters in the kilometers right

1275.51 --> 1281.32
that's a thousand right

1278.2 --> 1284.6200000000001
it literally yellow means thousand so

1281.32 --> 1287.6799999999998
yeah thousand meters yeah if I said to

1284.62 --> 1292.6
you I have 5000 meters what do you do to

1287.68 --> 1295.8700000000001
convert it into kilometers I divide them

1292.6 --> 1301.84
by a thousand correct tell her tonight

1295.87 --> 1303.3999999999999
the next target okay I what what's the

1301.84 --> 1306.04
point I didn't I don't get it here I

1303.4 --> 1310.26
don't get it responding to chat or

1306.04 --> 1312.19
something no no no just um

1310.26 --> 1316.51
what's been going through my head the

1312.19 --> 1318.13
last week or so is that the the question

1316.51 --> 1318.99
of whether we leave on a flight or a

1318.13 --> 1322.63
glog

1318.99 --> 1324.57
he's a question of geometry right and

1322.63 --> 1328.0600000000002
that's mathematics flight others have

1324.57 --> 1331.24
absolutely no idea about mathematics no

1328.06 --> 1334.4199999999998
it's not a matter of well technically

1331.24 --> 1336.34
the base argument is geometry but if you

1334.42 --> 1340.0600000000002
want to have pre for it you'll have to

1336.34 --> 1344.1999999999998
have actual empirical data to support it

1340.06 --> 1347.59
and one of these types of empirical data

1344.2 --> 1349.3300000000002
would be observation or it's probably

1347.59 --> 1351.97
going to be the only way to kind of

1349.33 --> 1354.3999999999999
deduce it because of the scale of it the

1351.97 --> 1355.99
suppose you like it all down but yeah

1354.4 --> 1359.0500000000002
then you're gonna have to apply all

1355.99 --> 1361.39
optic effects so and then the optics

1359.05 --> 1363.1299999999999
effects the things that are involved in

1361.39 --> 1369.24
actual sight and cameras and all that

1363.13 --> 1371.8600000000001
lensing kind of supersede the geometry

1369.24 --> 1374.44
calculations in all aspects and this is

1371.86 --> 1377.6499999999999
provable so that it we have demonstrated

1374.44 --> 1381.25
this you were there and you saw it when

1377.65 --> 1383.2
you put it when you put a camera on the

1381.25 --> 1386.5
ground you put a pillar in front of it

1383.2 --> 1390.16
you put it twice as large pillar exactly

1386.5 --> 1392.11
twice the distance geometrically if you

1390.16 --> 1394.5700000000002
take the side view you could pull a

1392.11 --> 1396.4299999999998
straight line here in the camera to the

1394.57 --> 1399.1899999999998
top of the first pillar and the second

1396.43 --> 1402.64
and then if you actually look through

1399.19 --> 1404.89
the camera properly placed very

1402.64 --> 1408.3400000000001
correctly you'll notice that the first

1404.89 --> 1411.7900000000002
pillar is actually not on target and the

1408.34 --> 1415.84
back one is below it because I'll take

1411.79 --> 1418.06
apply because optics apply and thus

1415.84 --> 1420.82
geometry something that you would see in

1418.06 --> 1424.03
a sideview cannot accurately represent a

1420.82 --> 1426.7
viewing function and that's in my

1424.03 --> 1430.96
argument on the Jose's hangout a few

1426.7 --> 1433.24
weeks ago okay but that's very important

1430.96 --> 1436.78
to figure out that as soon as you get

1433.24 --> 1439.77
real site involved actual optics become

1436.78 --> 1443.3799999999999
entangled and they they overtake any

1439.77 --> 1445.84
geometrical design like suggestion

1443.38 --> 1448.0
literal sizes don't are completely

1445.84 --> 1450.79
irrelevant for what you see

1448.0 --> 1454.33
solutely loss no it is absolutely it's

1450.79 --> 1457.6299999999999
it's on the back burner no it is really

1454.33 --> 1461.11
and I just gave you an example of how

1457.63 --> 1463.15
you can demonstrate this you're so you

1461.11 --> 1464.9499999999998
could do this if you want it oh I just

1463.15 --> 1466.39
remember a conversation I had with you

1464.95 --> 1468.3700000000001
on Scott where you said up you're just

1466.39 --> 1471.64
about to disprove the entire field of

1468.37 --> 1475.1499999999999
trigonometry and both rhombus and I

1471.64 --> 1478.72
laughed at you feel what no no hold on

1475.15 --> 1481.5
trigonometry is just math okay right but

1478.72 --> 1484.9
is it so a reference not the entire

1481.5 --> 1487.48
trigonometry I it's all involved with

1484.9 --> 1490.2
trigonometry based on the celestial

1487.48 --> 1493.78
bodies its celestial trigonometry

1490.2 --> 1498.3700000000001
because there you have to presuppose a

1493.78 --> 1501.01
distance or an exact angular size or an

1498.37 --> 1502.9599999999998
exact size either way because you only

1501.01 --> 1506.92
have the angular relations angular sizes

1502.96 --> 1509.44
and angular position in relation to the

1506.92 --> 1511.8700000000001
observer that's a technical data people

1509.44 --> 1514.3
have and you can't actually use

1511.87 --> 1517.84
trigonometry on that not honestly

1514.3 --> 1520.99
because real trigonometry the origins of

1517.84 --> 1523.75
trigonometry is to take two points and

1520.99 --> 1525.91
then calculate the third one basically

1523.75 --> 1530.62
its distance and all that based on

1525.91 --> 1532.6000000000001
knowledge of actual locations or size

1530.62 --> 1535.78
that kind of thing that's how it works

1532.6 --> 1537.8799999999999
and thus you don't use it honestly on

1535.78 --> 1540.52
the celestial bodies without

1537.88 --> 1542.3500000000001
presupposing something and flatter

1540.52 --> 1544.87
visitors have done the same thing

1542.35 --> 1547.4189999999999
they've done the same trick

1544.87 --> 1550.33
you just presuppose another shape and

1547.419 --> 1553.0900000000001
then it suddenly works out at the closer

1550.33 --> 1553.96
distances no you don't need to know the

1553.09 --> 1556.6589999999999
size of something

1553.96 --> 1558.73
yes you you need either the size or the

1556.659 --> 1560.6100000000001
exact distance and you need to know it

1558.73 --> 1564.4
you need to have confirmation of this

1560.61 --> 1568.059
physical measurable confirmation not

1564.4 --> 1569.65
some distant idea you take a point to

1568.059 --> 1573.1589999999999
say the center point of the Sun or

1569.65 --> 1575.679
whatever or a dot like a star that's

1573.159 --> 1577.5700000000002
what you do your angles to there's no

1575.679 --> 1581.6200000000001
there's no angular size of that there's

1577.57 --> 1584.4399999999998
no angular size of a point sir sighs

1581.62 --> 1587.049
yeah you have an angle but that's it

1584.44 --> 1590.3500000000001
look that trigonometry is based on

1587.049 --> 1594.6689999999999
knowing confirming that there is an

1590.35 --> 1598.1789999999999
exact position somewhere it's not there

1594.669 --> 1600.3700000000001
that's what trigonometry is it's you

1598.179 --> 1603.49
can't use it on celestial bodies because

1600.37 --> 1605.649
you have no confirmation of a size or

1603.49 --> 1609.1
location because you just have no angle

1605.649 --> 1613.149
and you have to presuppose that it has a

1609.1 --> 1616.4189999999999
specific size or location first and then

1613.149 --> 1621.1299999999999
based that set the distance based on a

1616.419 --> 1626.74
model not based on the size though based

1621.13 --> 1628.2990000000002
on their angle yeah it's both are kind

1626.74 --> 1630.1
of involved in the same thing I guess

1628.299 --> 1634.3899999999999
with their trigonometry size is not

1630.1 --> 1636.73
important we need to run a triangle I

1634.39 --> 1637.99
just you just pointed at the epicenter

1636.73 --> 1640.779
of what are you looking at so the center

1637.99 --> 1644.279
of the Sun or the dot in the sky all

1640.779 --> 1647.049
right yeah what else we fought back

1644.279 --> 1651.01
Raley's criteria our discussion is

1647.049 --> 1653.2
district Riley's criterion right yeah

1651.01 --> 1656.049
but I'm not saying that trigonometry

1653.2 --> 1659.679
isn't a functional trick it's very

1656.049 --> 1663.01
functional but in the real world in the

1659.679 --> 1665.169
physical confirmable world and that's

1663.01 --> 1666.94
the only water quiet to the Stars

1665.169 --> 1669.5490000000002
because you think they're intangible and

1666.94 --> 1672.25
not in any position no but that's a it's

1669.549 --> 1674.5
not about them in 10 you it's about not

1672.25 --> 1678.43
having the proof that their physical

1674.5 --> 1679.87
actual proof allergy

1678.43 --> 1683.5
they are physical or not if you'd

1679.87 --> 1685.9299999999998
approach it is approachability yeah

1683.5 --> 1687.88
proven what security it's done it's

1685.93 --> 1692.0800000000002
3,000 miles up do you think you could

1687.88 --> 1694.3300000000002
get there you would have to in order to

1692.08 --> 1696.1899999999998
prove that it is actually three thousand

1694.33 --> 1700.3
miles up you would have to go closer and

1696.19 --> 1704.92
then somehow get a proximity to that

1700.3 --> 1707.1699999999998
origin of the light but in terms of like

1704.92 --> 1708.76
what you get there and find out what it

1707.17 --> 1712.78
is you have to figure out where it is

1708.76 --> 1715.15
first well you can see it at least and

1712.78 --> 1717.37
the natural course would be to go into

1715.15 --> 1719.0800000000002
the direction of the light yep

1717.37 --> 1720.4599999999998
figure out how far it is away like how

1719.08 --> 1722.1699999999998
much how much fuel II gonna take he

1720.46 --> 1724.81
gonna take 93 million miles with a fuel

1722.17 --> 1727.42
or 3000 ball well that depends on on

1724.81 --> 1729.55
your attempt you know is usually in

1727.42 --> 1731.68
stages but how far can you even go

1729.55 --> 1733.72
because I don't think we can get out

1731.68 --> 1736.41
above a certain layer because the air

1733.72 --> 1739.8
pressures just too low and our current

1736.41 --> 1746.02
propulsion systems don't work above that

1739.8 --> 1749.95
pretty sure yeah you don't really so I I

1746.02 --> 1753.4
do think so but yeah okay but is it so

1749.95 --> 1755.65
worth it's worth a try but somehow in a

1753.4 --> 1761.1100000000001
proximity to one of these celestial

1755.65 --> 1762.8500000000001
bodies would dissuade me perhaps that

1761.11 --> 1764.5
all of the globe of the heavens is

1762.85 --> 1769.1999999999998
purely holographic and like based

1764.5 --> 1772.87
literature see it is not unfalsifiable

1769.2 --> 1774.97
okay my theory their theories but I'm

1772.87 --> 1778.7199999999998
just going with this one really because

1774.97 --> 1781.21
I am very convinced this is actually the

1778.72 --> 1786.48
case this is gonna turn out to be the

1781.21 --> 1790.3
case not saying that I know it is but I

1786.48 --> 1792.91
definitely feel like this is it because

1790.3 --> 1795.52
I getting I'm not getting the counter

1792.91 --> 1800.0800000000002
evidence I'm and I am asking I am being

1795.52 --> 1805.12
open for criticism about it okay Riley's

1800.08 --> 1807.37
criterion Oh God yeah right optics yeah

1805.12 --> 1810.78
yeah do you understand that it's based

1807.37 --> 1810.78
on the diameter of the aperture

1812.03 --> 1817.29
yeah it's a really a resolution issue

1814.88 --> 1820.92
yeah so if you've got a really big

1817.29 --> 1823.08
telescope or even medium let the

1820.92 --> 1828.5
telescope medium sized telescope you

1823.08 --> 1832.97
understand that the the distance apart

1828.5 --> 1841.02
for two objects that critical angle is

1832.97 --> 1843.809
negligible wait say again last part that

1841.02 --> 1846.179
critical angle where two points to

1843.809 --> 1849.09
objects or points of light are not

1846.179 --> 1853.71
resolvable do you understand that that

1849.09 --> 1857.6399999999999
angle is negligible right that's how it

1853.71 --> 1862.53
falls away out of sight in the terms of

1857.64 --> 1867.0300000000002
in the it tends to fall into the

1862.53 --> 1869.46
horizons out if you describe it likable

1867.03 --> 1871.5
how will you experience it with your

1869.46 --> 1874.5900000000001
eyes what I'm trying to get at is you've

1871.5 --> 1878.04
got some observation like can agooo in

1874.59 --> 1881.87
France right and there is a over 2000

1878.04 --> 1885.0
liters of the mountain missing right

1881.87 --> 1887.1899999999998
yeah how Israelis criterion meant to

1885.0 --> 1890.7
explain that why it's very far away

1887.19 --> 1894.78
probably right yes now the mountain is

1890.7 --> 1898.38
very small 2000 meters at yes and how

1894.78 --> 1904.37
far yeah distance yeah 2000 meters at a

1898.38 --> 1904.3700000000001
distance of where are we 270 automatic

1904.429 --> 1916.89
gotta form a little angular size not

1907.26 --> 1918.6
talking nothing angle distance 277 days

1916.89 --> 1925.17
I think days

1918.6 --> 1928.26
what kilometers okay that's an extremely

1925.17 --> 1931.8000000000002
far distance so that mountains gonna be

1928.26 --> 1934.86
angular wise minutely small rock

1931.8 --> 1938.49
guaranteed ourselves 2,000 kilometers is

1934.86 --> 1942.24
absolutely nothing mm meters so it's

1938.49 --> 1944.73
2,000 3,000 years that's nothing missing

1942.24 --> 1946.65
from a mountain that is 277

1944.73 --> 1949.8600000000001
an extremely small but due to

1946.65 --> 1951.5400000000002
perspective the angular size of that

1949.86 --> 1955.9799999999998
missing amount I've just put into the

1951.54 --> 1959.73
calculator is 0.41 degrees zero like 1/2

1955.98 --> 1962.31
degree 0.41 / degree okay all right all

1959.73 --> 1965.52
right so Raley's criterion where's my

1962.31 --> 1970.1599999999999
little diffraction limit so I'm gonna

1965.52 --> 1972.45
use a sail use of p900 at maximum zoom

1970.16 --> 1975.5600000000002
which has an aperture size of

1972.45 --> 1980.01
approximately 50 millimeters and I am at

1975.56 --> 1983.52
200m examine okay

1980.01 --> 1986.82
Raley's criterion if two points four

1983.52 --> 1991.53
meters apart four meters they won't be

1986.82 --> 1995.1599999999999
resolvable four meters compared to 2000

1991.53 --> 2000.29
meters hidden that's how negligible this

1995.16 --> 2001.67
stuff is 4 meters it was serious 4

2000.29 --> 2004.6399999999999
meters that's what Riley's criterion

2001.67 --> 2008.8700000000001
works out to be it's over at P 900 that

2004.64 --> 2013.73
distance 4 meters let's try an 8 inch

2008.87 --> 2018.85
telescope so that's like one pixel

2013.73 --> 2023.33
basically later sad but at what is it

2018.85 --> 2028.4599999999998
250 how many kilometers was it again 207

2023.33 --> 2031.34
I thank you all right okay and if you

2028.46 --> 2034.82
use an 8 inch telescope it makes it a

2031.34 --> 2036.79
meter one meter is not resolvable so

2034.82 --> 2040.84
Raley's criterion complete red herring

2036.79 --> 2043.46
interesting under the curve calculator

2040.84 --> 2045.62
well it's just one of the elements the

2043.46 --> 2048.71
the other factors are also at play and

2045.62 --> 2051.14
it's a much more complicated math but

2048.71 --> 2053.39
that's it's just one of the elements and

2051.14 --> 2055.5699999999997
it does count especially yeah you could

2053.39 --> 2058.37
prove that when you try things up close

2055.57 --> 2060.11
like would you go really down low to the

2058.37 --> 2062.24
floor things will still obstruct and

2060.11 --> 2066.07
that is definitely Raley's criteria at

2062.24 --> 2069.83
play looking past the flat surface but

2066.07 --> 2071.27
yeah it's it thanks for the for the

2069.83 --> 2074.36
update that's interesting so there's

2071.27 --> 2077.9
definitely more at play the problem with

2074.36 --> 2078.38
doing observations over the the distance

2077.9 --> 2081.8
of like

2078.38 --> 2083.42
house but still look you this is all

2081.8 --> 2085.94
talk by the way you haven't actually

2083.42 --> 2087.6800000000003
shown what you did so I'm not I don't

2085.94 --> 2090.62
know what picture you're talking about

2087.68 --> 2096.52
in this case okay so let me do something

2090.62 --> 2096.52
else we're gonna find a picture of it

2097.06 --> 2103.31
give me me find it

2099.47 --> 2106.4599999999996
and also I'm by the way this is also not

2103.31 --> 2108.38
affected the the optical effects the

2106.46 --> 2110.87
mirroring effect the clear mirroring

2108.38 --> 2113.81
layer that is out that will definitely

2110.87 --> 2118.79
at that kind of distance be involved so

2113.81 --> 2121.46
that the mirroring maybe some of the

2118.79 --> 2124.4
effects that is obscuring the bottom

2121.46 --> 2128.8
part which may not be Riley's criteria

2124.4 --> 2136.54
but another type of effect may be a

2128.8 --> 2140.15
refractive effect not sure stop is to

2136.54 --> 2146.75
Skype not just presented here you know

2140.15 --> 2154.67
no way tonight the green button upper

2146.75 --> 2158.32
corner can I put my hand over the never

2154.67 --> 2170.8
the hangout like don't worry it's

2158.32 --> 2170.8
stretching the chats out yeah yeah no

2172.96 --> 2180.37
screen to [ __ ] alright screen sharing

2176.6 --> 2180.37
there now where is my image

2189.72 --> 2194.859
here we go

2191.109 --> 2197.13
there's Kenna Gert Wow German is all

2194.859 --> 2200.019
right Janice that is awesome

2197.13 --> 2202.48
yeah the Sun like particular times in

2200.019 --> 2205.0589999999997
the year the Sun sets right behind that

2202.48 --> 2208.23
mountain from this place in France which

2205.059 --> 2210.759
is 320 meters above sea levels I think

2208.23 --> 2215.859
and you get the peak just the tippy tops

2210.759 --> 2217.45
can occur right okay so there's like two

2215.859 --> 2217.8089999999997
and a half thousand metres of missing

2217.45 --> 2220.749
here

2217.809 --> 2222.579
so the actual sea level is like daddy is

2220.749 --> 2227.1699999999996
somewhere is that like 2,000 meters

2222.579 --> 2230.069
right okay so maybe there's something it

2227.17 --> 2233.529
looks almost like there's like an ocean

2230.069 --> 2238.71
apparently really high up so could that

2233.529 --> 2242.019
just be clouds there in the front of the

2238.71 --> 2245.68
bottom this is the horizon

2242.019 --> 2247.2099999999996
how do you know that's the ocean you say

2245.68 --> 2250.18
the [ __ ] this is like fully zoomed in

2247.21 --> 2253.48
when you zoom out it's obvious this is

2250.18 --> 2255.8799999999997
the ocean all right there's a slight

2253.48 --> 2260.339
inferior Mirage there and this is the

2255.88 --> 2263.4990000000003
peak and a from memory it's like 2780

2260.339 --> 2267.0389999999998
2007 Hyundai tea meters filming and this

2263.499 --> 2269.7389999999996
one I think is 2630 all right so you can

2267.039 --> 2272.349
do all sorts of geometry oh yeah yeah I

2269.739 --> 2274.96
get that I get that it's probably

2272.349 --> 2277.089
there's there should be more of it if it

2274.96 --> 2279.849
was completely unobstructed and

2277.089 --> 2282.999
concealed you should see more to the

2279.849 --> 2284.049
bottom of it right that's the idea you

2282.999 --> 2289.4199999999996
should say all of it if you want to

2284.049 --> 2292.569
follow yeah no not we're dealing with

2289.42 --> 2294.599
optics not just geometry okay this is

2292.569 --> 2297.4
not due to curvature that's ridiculous

2294.599 --> 2299.8590000000004
probably none of it should be visible if

2297.4 --> 2304.69
you actually try to presuppose it's on

2299.859 --> 2308.589
the globe seriously no more than two

2304.69 --> 2310.66
ordered more than two hundred seventy

2308.589 --> 2313.9
seven kilometers man and shouldn't be

2310.66 --> 2316.45
visible at all well because it's way too

2313.9 --> 2318.65
far away should be completely behind

2316.45 --> 2320.8999999999996
curve even if it is about

2318.65 --> 2323.7200000000003
if you deny refraction yes it should be

2320.9 --> 2328.069
all right yeah des looming around the

2323.72 --> 2329.99
curve right yeah right let's go yeah now

2328.069 --> 2331.819
that doesn't make any damn sense because

2329.99 --> 2334.4799999999996
then you shouldn't see any obstruction

2331.819 --> 2337.19
ever then it should always look flat

2334.48 --> 2338.72
doesn't you do argue oh it's being

2337.19 --> 2340.9700000000003
obstructed because it has to be

2338.72 --> 2342.74
curvature this is Nathan talked about

2340.97 --> 2344.72
this yesterday this is exactly what you

2342.74 --> 2346.9399999999996
do everything has to be curvature but if

2344.72 --> 2350.8689999999997
you shouldn't see it then it's because

2346.94 --> 2353.18
of looming so it's a very cheap basic

2350.869 --> 2355.759
tactic you don't really even have to

2353.18 --> 2358.46
apply a lot of thought to it but

2355.759 --> 2362.299
seriously this is obviously a mirror

2358.46 --> 2365.48
layer and it's very far away and I don't

2362.299 --> 2367.97
know exactly what causes it the mirror

2365.48 --> 2369.92
effect from the optical slant point as I

2367.97 --> 2372.529
described it is just something that I

2369.92 --> 2378.23
see I don't know what causes it that is

2372.529 --> 2379.91
all but is I'm pretty if you'd have

2378.23 --> 2384.499
other things in front of this mountain

2379.91 --> 2388.3689999999997
to compare the the same type of things

2384.499 --> 2390.68
that are a concealed and I bet you that

2388.369 --> 2393.2200000000003
the concealment rate versus distance is

2390.68 --> 2396.769
linear so that that also has a

2393.22 --> 2399.259
geometrical fact tied into that that's

2396.769 --> 2401.41
another one of my arguments I definitely

2399.259 --> 2404.7690000000002
think that the earth is flat because I

2401.41 --> 2407.1189999999997
presume that the concealment rate is

2404.769 --> 2412.4599999999996
linear versus distance being at the

2407.119 --> 2416.63
optical slant point why do you deny

2412.46 --> 2419.289
refraction I don't deny refraction

2416.63 --> 2421.609
I just don't misinterpret it and

2419.289 --> 2423.3190000000004
presuppose it's curving around the ball

2421.609 --> 2427.8489999999997
because that's total science fiction

2423.319 --> 2430.97
nonsense no yes yes it is it's not proof

2427.849 --> 2433.279
it's not supported by actual optics do

2430.97 --> 2434.9599999999996
you understand that the air close to the

2433.279 --> 2436.029
surface is generally more dense than the

2434.96 --> 2439.16
air Huayra

2436.029 --> 2442.46
all right there's all kinds of bending

2439.16 --> 2444.14
yeah that's right but it doesn't bend it

2442.46 --> 2446.569
around the curve and light doesn't do

2444.14 --> 2449.15
that as soon as you accept that lot

2446.569 --> 2450.65
bends in a curve looming is a natural

2449.15 --> 2452.12
side effect of that yeah I know it I

2450.65 --> 2454.37
know as soon as you accept

2452.12 --> 2456.83
total [ __ ] then everything becomes

2454.37 --> 2458.6
really easy and curved I know but it

2456.83 --> 2463.13
doesn't work that way you can

2458.6 --> 2465.95
demonstrate that presuppose it's like a

2463.13 --> 2467.87
good deal where do you accept that air

2465.95 --> 2469.79
close to the surface is more dense

2467.87 --> 2471.31
generally if you get a little bit above

2469.79 --> 2475.97
the surface maybe twenty meters right

2471.31 --> 2478.5499999999997
air at that little discussion with life

2475.97 --> 2481.5699999999997
assured he's the expert at it he has

2478.55 --> 2484.3700000000003
real statistical research backed up data

2481.57 --> 2486.4700000000003
concerning the effects the actual

2484.37 --> 2488.5699999999997
effects of refraction and the different

2486.47 --> 2492.08
types of refractive effects in different

2488.57 --> 2493.9700000000003
air layers with different moist levels

2492.08 --> 2497.0299999999997
and different temperature influences

2493.97 --> 2500.0299999999997
they all pretty much radically can

2497.03 --> 2502.7000000000003
influence how light behaves and there is

2500.03 --> 2506.57
no uniformity to it whatsoever

2502.7 --> 2509.72
especially not in a curve mode in a kind

2506.57 --> 2512.6600000000003
of curved path way that wasn't exist

2509.72 --> 2515.5099999999998
we are in discussion we are in

2512.66 --> 2518.21
discussion he has sent me a paper with a

2515.51 --> 2521.0600000000004
formula to calculate refractive indices

2518.21 --> 2522.8
I have applied that formula and shown

2521.06 --> 2526.34
him the results to show that light will

2522.8 --> 2528.5
curve downwards right well I'm not I

2526.34 --> 2531.6400000000003
don't know about your back and forth and

2528.5 --> 2535.61
at that I just know where I know and

2531.64 --> 2538.2799999999997
yeah sorry you can't you can't have your

2535.61 --> 2541.4
curvature and your looming at the same

2538.28 --> 2543.17
time and you constantly do it you switch

2541.4 --> 2545.0
around this is not even about what is

2543.17 --> 2548.4500000000003
technically that this is just about the

2545.0 --> 2549.02
way that you always argue this argument

2548.45 --> 2553.16
either

2549.02 --> 2554.57
it's obstructed due to curvature or oh

2553.16 --> 2556.2799999999997
it shouldn't be seen at all the

2554.57 --> 2558.8
curvature should be overtaking okay then

2556.28 --> 2561.86
it's looming it's always one of the eyes

2558.8 --> 2565.25
are always one of both what it is not

2561.86 --> 2569.78
it's not an ominous it's not part of the

2565.25 --> 2573.23
debate it's just yeah it's a false

2569.78 --> 2575.27
dichotomy tactic for people to deny

2573.23 --> 2576.59
refraction they are a certain that the

2575.27 --> 2579.53
atmosphere has the same density

2576.59 --> 2582.6200000000003
throughout so my question to anyone that

2579.53 --> 2583.6400000000003
denies effect except it doesn't it

2582.62 --> 2585.43
doesn't have the same velocity

2583.64 --> 2588.7599999999998
throughout there for

2585.43 --> 2589.5989999999997
there's vans noises yeah therefore light

2588.76 --> 2593.2900000000004
with band right

2589.599 --> 2595.599
yeah but not uniform yes at all not even

2593.29 --> 2598.15
uniform but the the density gradient is

2595.599 --> 2599.26
you know roughly steady atmosphere mixes

2598.15 --> 2604.44
together and what I've got and the

2599.26 --> 2604.44
pressure gradient is pretty steady right

2604.71 --> 2612.79
right you accept that there is a density

2607.51 --> 2616.8900000000003
gradient in the atmosphere yes yes okay

2612.79 --> 2616.89
which way does that density gradient go

2616.92 --> 2625.839
which we as in down that's the that's a

2622.45 --> 2628.93
spectrum of it so air at the surface is

2625.839 --> 2632.47
more dense than air at five kilometers

2628.93 --> 2635.71
yes hang on what rubbish in there I have

2632.47 --> 2639.359
a child out of bed give me one second

2635.71 --> 2639.359
I'll be back all right

2642.69 --> 2645.929
[Music]

2665.17 --> 2672.52
if anyone else wants to join in and

2670.01 --> 2672.5200000000004
they're welcome to

2680.39 --> 2685.31
all right I have a child in a bit all

2683.25 --> 2685.31
right

2686.99 --> 2692.25
density gradient more dense of the

2689.49 --> 2697.08
surface lower density going up that

2692.25 --> 2697.5
causes downward refraction the end good

2697.08 --> 2703.94
night

2697.5 --> 2703.94
see our okay

2706.67 --> 2717.5
right so downward refraction and he's

2710.539 --> 2720.26
saying that what exactly causes downward

2717.5 --> 2723.41
refraction is it the high pressure part

2720.26 --> 2726.8900000000003
or is it the low pressure part or how

2723.41 --> 2730.0989999999997
does that really work I don't I don't

2726.89 --> 2734.21
see the point really here as I suggested

2730.099 --> 2737.9900000000002
before basically explained it's not

2734.21 --> 2739.73
uniform yes there is bending going on

2737.99 --> 2742.4599999999996
but it's not uniform it's not going to

2739.73 --> 2745.22
be light is not gonna go a specific

2742.46 --> 2749.2690000000002
circular path because of refraction

2745.22 --> 2757.279
effects it's pretty much a corner every

2749.269 --> 2758.359
time it's not gonna go in a curve so

2757.279 --> 2766.519
yeah I do

2758.359 --> 2775.19
anyway good night through him I guess he

2766.519 --> 2778.0989999999997
thinks he won the point or something I'm

2775.19 --> 2780.14
pretty sure I cracked his with just

2778.099 --> 2782.15
pointing out that it's very convenient

2780.14 --> 2785.66
to switch around that either it is

2782.15 --> 2787.73
obstructed due to curvature or it is not

2785.66 --> 2789.589
because it's looming and you pick

2787.73 --> 2794.14
whichever is the case that's very

2789.589 --> 2798.769
convenient and not actually honest it's

2794.14 --> 2802.67
it's a false dichotomy two things that

2798.769 --> 2805.3999999999996
don't you can't be the same they can't

2802.67 --> 2807.92
seriously suggest that that happens at

2805.4 --> 2811.819
the same time because the end results

2807.92 --> 2813.6800000000003
are very different visually so you can't

2811.819 --> 2815.509
just pick and choose with every

2813.68 --> 2818.39
situation which one of these effects

2815.509 --> 2822.039
you're going to be applying when it's

2818.39 --> 2822.0389999999998
just it's crazy

2828.08 --> 2836.94
hello Ali hey that could resist sorry

2832.95 --> 2842.04
alright so that was hilarious

2836.94 --> 2844.89
Oh is he good yeah yeah he left he left

2842.04 --> 2847.23
think yeah I probably in his mind he was

2844.89 --> 2849.45
like walking away while my hangout was

2847.23 --> 2850.32
blowing up or something in his

2849.45 --> 2853.56
imagination

2850.32 --> 2862.1400000000003
I thought he like really won so he left

2853.56 --> 2864.45
oh oh no asking ah may I stop because he

2862.14 --> 2867.93
was talking a bit not like hoshi a lead

2864.45 --> 2869.3399999999997
it's deadly deluge you know yeah yeah

2867.93 --> 2871.23
but he was I just wigs

2869.34 --> 2872.9
I just went to explain about that just

2871.23 --> 2875.55
it just to me I'm seen with her late Oh

2872.9 --> 2877.32
cuz I wanted to ask him what he was

2875.55 --> 2880.02
looking at that moment so far away but

2877.32 --> 2881.9100000000003
how far away was the horizon and he even

2880.02 --> 2883.74
mentioned about you know the stuffing

2881.91 --> 2884.94
wheels aren't mystery is more thick at

2883.74 --> 2887.1299999999997
the bought me out this feels more like

2884.94 --> 2889.4
at important than that this is talk and

2887.13 --> 2893.4300000000003
I was I was trying to get it through

2889.4 --> 2896.04
with the late that real late from the

2893.43 --> 2898.29
board Milan mountain I as getting

2896.04 --> 2901.35
brought to you by atmosphere and also

2898.29 --> 2905.7599999999998
because the horizon lanes the horizons

2901.35 --> 2907.38
weary closer and then that mountain so

2905.76 --> 2910.4100000000003
that may I got romp this jagged evil

2907.38 --> 2913.86
eyes yes nothing I talked to my buddy no

2910.41 --> 2915.39
and I was gonna see I know it's it's a

2913.86 --> 2917.25
lot because you were too late you could

2915.39 --> 2918.6
you'll be too late sources healing

2917.25 --> 2920.67
you've got the light coming from the

2918.6 --> 2924.0899999999997
horizon for its travels we faster and

2920.67 --> 2926.19
it's got higher intensity know that that

2924.09 --> 2928.17
in mountain is Amala how many I don't

2926.19 --> 2930.75
know how many males are even more you

2928.17 --> 2933.12
think how much atmosphere that late

2930.75 --> 2934.92
especially in the bottom are in the

2933.12 --> 2937.5
partner that moment in the late that's

2934.92 --> 2940.38
traveling in a traveling towards its of

2937.5 --> 2942.57
less of it in tin Z so it's but more

2940.38 --> 2945.03
atmosphere so yeah yeah you're naturally

2942.57 --> 2948.0
your brains gonna resolve the height and

2945.03 --> 2950.3100000000004
Eisen Lane as a lane because it comes up

2948.0 --> 2953.64
to your right and it been possible you

2950.31 --> 2956.04
see and and you can you can see reports

2953.64 --> 2959.1299999999997
what's amazing the men are all starts

2956.04 --> 2961.14
nice nose is clean stays clear and that

2959.13 --> 2962.1600000000003
ball just disappears police not

2961.14 --> 2964.89
guarantee honey

2962.16 --> 2966.33
no late the later the when the horizons

2964.89 --> 2968.8199999999997
getting to you like before where higher

2966.33 --> 2971.61
intense equals it's got less atmosphere

2968.82 --> 2973.71
it's as simple as that and the thing is

2971.61 --> 2976.44
what he was seeing about that really

2973.71 --> 2977.61
concealing his real about where you

2976.44 --> 2979.77
great think it that's where you've got a

2977.61 --> 2981.42
light source on the horizon this is her

2979.77 --> 2983.22
uh protector on this I said you've got a

2981.42 --> 2984.33
light source on the horizon me

2983.22 --> 2986.3999999999996
understanding you

2984.33 --> 2989.67
I win standing on the horizon Airport

2986.4 --> 2993.03
and I'm ten miles away with the same

2989.67 --> 2996.48
sign he's a torch and the same intensity

2993.03 --> 2999.9300000000003
or the same intensity of thought and

2996.48 --> 3003.05
it's set up and are we that set up in a

2999.93 --> 3006.1099999999997
way that the the light in the background

3003.05 --> 3008.54
is you can see just above and you just

3006.11 --> 3011.0
looked it at its higher than the horizon

3008.54 --> 3013.19
is you law that down and get law and

3011.0 --> 3014.6
more to the late that's on her lines and

3013.19 --> 3017.42
as long as you keep it in Lane universe

3014.6 --> 3019.52
it's Ana vehicle things we've got one in

3017.42 --> 3021.8
one light on the horizon you've got

3019.52 --> 3023.33
another like this that's above the

3021.8 --> 3026.1800000000003
horizon but it's like a lot of trade

3023.33 --> 3028.1
emails we know you as you and it's of

3026.18 --> 3029.8999999999996
less intensity because of the fact it's

3028.1 --> 3032.66
coming through more atmosphere does that

3029.9 --> 3035.96
gets law to the light source and Eisen

3032.66 --> 3038.0899999999997
it's good in washout oh you missed Emily

3035.96 --> 3040.73
so you'll get in the light your scene

3038.09 --> 3042.86
the person is looking at you with a

3040.73 --> 3045.08
torch and looking at me the torch they

3042.86 --> 3046.73
only see you of torch it's not that my

3045.08 --> 3048.59
torch is not shining light of course

3046.73 --> 3050.78
Isis doesn't know I've got my light

3048.59 --> 3052.73
switched on so of course does like em

3050.78 --> 3054.6800000000003
and even from there but it's not going

3052.73 --> 3057.89
to calm me off than the factors that a

3054.68 --> 3059.99
one is going to resolve the horizon Lane

3057.89 --> 3062.54
Faust so anything good anything that

3059.99 --> 3064.8199999999997
goes behind that just gets less and less

3062.54 --> 3066.56
and because of the fact is the light

3064.82 --> 3067.2400000000002
source is rated that ball right on the

3066.56 --> 3069.71
wall

3067.24 --> 3072.7099999999996
it's not going to resolve your lies not

3069.71 --> 3075.4700000000003
going to lose over and their latest late

3072.71 --> 3079.91
if it's best to draw if you're drawing a

3075.47 --> 3081.08
diagram and you imagine well I wish I

3079.91 --> 3083.6
could have drawn a diagram if you

3081.08 --> 3085.52
imagine your stand and they see I'll

3083.6 --> 3087.7999999999997
draw a lane on one end of a journal a

3085.52 --> 3089.78
manila right and then what I'll do is

3087.8 --> 3092.3
I've got a light source by

3089.78 --> 3094.61
me and they'll be late coming from the

3092.3 --> 3096.59
horizon towards mine they are set an

3094.61 --> 3098.48
angle many sorts but not got an angle

3096.59 --> 3102.29
now you're like this coming from the

3098.48 --> 3103.67
enemies coming in straight lines so

3102.29 --> 3105.05
you've got an angle coming from the

3103.67 --> 3106.94
hawaii's and that leads coming up at an

3105.05 --> 3109.01
angle right no night was not come

3106.94 --> 3110.81
expected I am totally not following what

3109.01 --> 3116.1800000000003
the hell you're trying to describe here

3110.81 --> 3118.31
this is no weird dummy that means I see

3116.18 --> 3122.12
that drawing oh yeah that would probably

3118.31 --> 3124.91
help a lot if you just showed it instead

3122.12 --> 3127.46
of tell because yes I understand

3124.91 --> 3130.58
I'll Texas very commonly source close up

3127.46 --> 3132.86
to you will resolve well there will be a

3130.58 --> 3135.38
bigger than a light source of the same

3132.86 --> 3138.2000000000003
intensity let's follow the right but

3135.38 --> 3141.35
there because the light is absorbed by

3138.2 --> 3143.45
matter that is in between it is absorbed

3141.35 --> 3146.68
by the matter so it intentional unless

3143.45 --> 3149.7799999999997
is over distance your atmosphere matter

3146.68 --> 3150.71
gases matter as well gaseous matter as

3149.78 --> 3153.9500000000003
well and the thicker

3150.71 --> 3155.9
maybe you'll get picked on the less it

3153.95 --> 3157.8199999999997
will see that right you ain't that we

3155.9 --> 3160.4
are big huge discussing the balls just

3157.82 --> 3162.44
stick to atmosphere because when if you

3160.4 --> 3164.54
say that matter are sweet and I'll just

3162.44 --> 3166.55
jump down you and your point will get

3164.54 --> 3168.29
lost you put your pointer get what some

3166.55 --> 3171.1400000000003
just seen I mean you know what I'm like

3168.29 --> 3173.24
oh that's the wrong what massive on what

3171.14 --> 3175.5499999999997
kind of thing you know so yeah I agree

3173.24 --> 3178.04
as matter cuz there is matter linear

3175.55 --> 3182.69
because water linear of course you're

3178.04 --> 3186.41
right nobody gasps - gasps - see again

3182.69 --> 3189.11
gas as well I'm prettier that light will

3186.41 --> 3194.5099999999998
be absorbed just even by transparent gas

3189.11 --> 3196.6400000000003
if the pressure is high enough I better

3194.51 --> 3198.98
of course yes yeah absolutely

3196.64 --> 3201.47
via NASA fine so now you thank you the

3198.98 --> 3203.09
light source coming from a 10 miles away

3201.47 --> 3205.1899999999996
compared to your late sources come and

3203.09 --> 3206.75
fight my resume about and the light

3205.19 --> 3209.03
source that's five miles away is a

3206.75 --> 3211.46
higher intensive so you're going to see

3209.03 --> 3214.5800000000004
that you're right yeah your eye is gonna

3211.46 --> 3216.62
resolve that fast and and the reason of

3214.58 --> 3219.49
common all the reefs I don't even

3216.62 --> 3222.5099999999998
believe it sorry or a weave or anything

3219.49 --> 3224.7
I mean against we came

3222.51 --> 3226.7700000000004
relocating Weiland oh nothing and he

3224.7 --> 3228.3799999999997
displayed that I was like that's exactly

3226.77 --> 3230.64
and I see up

3228.38 --> 3232.83
that's exactly how does he doesn't

3230.64 --> 3236.97
believe in lately a particle with

3232.83 --> 3239.31
photons and stuff like that he believes

3236.97 --> 3241.4399999999996
in the ether he explained and it was

3239.31 --> 3243.14
literally how I had in my head couldn't

3241.44 --> 3246.48
explain okay

3243.14 --> 3251.52
well I think that just an instantaneous

3246.48 --> 3255.27
beam of infinitely divisible energy

3251.52 --> 3257.67
quantities that are being released in

3255.27 --> 3260.19
the beam and can be refracted can be

3257.67 --> 3261.9300000000003
bent off split up and absorb matter I

3260.19 --> 3264.75
think that that is just that is how I

3261.93 --> 3268.47
approach it right now that's how I

3264.75 --> 3271.68
that's the the angle to that situation

3268.47 --> 3274.29
how I try to look into everything now

3271.68 --> 3276.21
and just compare it like does that work

3274.29 --> 3278.7599999999998
where's the missing data where's the

3276.21 --> 3284.0
presuppositions and what is going on

3278.76 --> 3286.4100000000003
here in the experiment or whatever yeah

3284.0 --> 3288.69
it's definitely to do with the light of

3286.41 --> 3290.94
I was talking to mommy just lastly you

3288.69 --> 3293.85
actually I was to do a hangout last

3290.94 --> 3297.06
night about a count of the cosmic egg

3293.85 --> 3300.0299999999997
yeah yeah yeah I was gonna do a man a

3297.06 --> 3301.92
guy deal he's well into astrology and

3300.03 --> 3304.3500000000004
stuff I thought he was gotta go yawns no

3301.92 --> 3306.42
awesome and there I was going to do a

3304.35 --> 3311.22
honey last night I talked to one of my

3306.42 --> 3313.11
flames and yeah he showed me he showed

3311.22 --> 3315.24
me some photographs and they just fetch

3313.11 --> 3316.83
them what I'm seeing but as I say we'll

3315.24 --> 3320.7599999999998
see what happens

3316.83 --> 3323.79
when it it might be maybe me of a hanger

3320.76 --> 3325.7400000000002
but that wasn't a explains exactly how I

3323.79 --> 3327.84
displayed what's happening I can prove

3325.74 --> 3330.0
it where if they want you're bringing

3327.84 --> 3332.46
equations he can do equations in all our

3330.0 --> 3336.0
minds no he's on his maths and stopping

3332.46 --> 3338.64
use reasons well what I got from Ken

3336.0 --> 3341.94
wheeler and I did like I totally get ken

3338.64 --> 3345.12
wheelers approach to electrons and

3341.94 --> 3347.91
magnetism and all that I get that fully

3345.12 --> 3350.91
that I'm very glad that I do but the

3347.91 --> 3353.37
light thing not yet but he pretty much

3350.91 --> 3355.8689999999997
shows that there is a direct connection

3353.37 --> 3357.339
to the rest of it and I

3355.869 --> 3359.859
do we have a feel for that but I just

3357.339 --> 3361.72
don't get exactly I don't it's not

3359.859 --> 3366.43
totally clear to me exactly what he

3361.72 --> 3368.589
means yet and I have doubts about it as

3366.43 --> 3371.23
we all should rights being a good

3368.589 --> 3373.599
scientist I also also see the connection

3371.23 --> 3377.38
with the Melissa TD fractal thinking

3373.599 --> 3378.819
what what de Chien was into a lot I

3377.38 --> 3384.9900000000002
haven't heard from her in a while

3378.819 --> 3388.119
but what's the name again so look it up

3384.99 --> 3389.68
he's not a sense of the more we love the

3388.119 --> 3393.6400000000003
given chance before yet

3389.68 --> 3395.6189999999997
he's your addition no no I don't know

3393.64 --> 3398.259
what no he's been on my is been on my

3395.619 --> 3407.2000000000003
hangout addition George F hold on let me

3398.259 --> 3410.079
get oh yeah yeah write a paper oh yeah

3407.2 --> 3413.5589999999997
it's still in the works of publishing it

3410.079 --> 3414.67
I think a lot yeah it was quite I tell

3413.559 --> 3417.0690000000004
you what you waited

3414.67 --> 3418.329
I don't think he's treated very well I

3417.069 --> 3420.73
don't think he's treated very well

3418.329 --> 3423.099
Nathan's at st. only thinks when he was

3420.73 --> 3425.529
trying to just see he look now but

3423.099 --> 3428.079
Dacian has his issues okay he has

3425.529 --> 3430.2
personality issues in the sense that he

3428.079 --> 3433.029
sometimes can have weird megalomaniacal

3430.2 --> 3437.109
tendencies doesn't make him a bad person

3433.029 --> 3439.349
but it's very overwhelming to him the

3437.109 --> 3442.42
experience of what he's going through

3439.349 --> 3446.4300000000003
figuring this out you see so much and

3442.42 --> 3450.2200000000003
yeah megalomaniacal side effects are not

3446.43 --> 3453.0989999999997
unexpected from fro for me I had it kind

3450.22 --> 3455.0789999999997
of the same way with some of my

3453.099 --> 3458.289
awakenings heavy awakenings hold on

3455.079 --> 3461.559
where is it so but he's a great guy of

3458.289 --> 3462.989
role a Walter Russell a Walter Russell

3461.559 --> 3465.67
that's it

3462.989 --> 3467.89
all right Walters because I like this

3465.67 --> 3470.739
nicely like to say I actually like this

3467.89 --> 3474.0389999999998
stuff is very interesting I'll put the

3470.739 --> 3476.65
link up in it in the chat again anyone

3474.039 --> 3479.2490000000003
can watch that it's pretty much where it

3476.65 --> 3479.2490000000003
all started

3480.18 --> 3484.589
because I see what I see Leia's Arwen

3483.0 --> 3486.539
and that's what that came we learned

3484.589 --> 3488.43
that the only way I could disclaimer if

3486.539 --> 3491.67
you remember remember the billboards

3488.43 --> 3494.6699999999996
where Lords are bulbs on right and then

3491.67 --> 3496.349
what happened was you and light bulbs

3494.67 --> 3498.299
would switch on and off baby would make

3496.349 --> 3499.77
it look as if there was a man running

3498.299 --> 3501.779
across his screen but it wasn't real it

3499.77 --> 3504.39
was just hexes could funneling on and

3501.779 --> 3507.42
off that's how I see light traveling

3504.39 --> 3508.859
through ether like that coming towards

3507.42 --> 3510.089
you you know it wouldn't that me but you

3508.859 --> 3513.109
can't see that happening when it's

3510.089 --> 3515.94
probably coming towards us or sleeping

3513.109 --> 3519.119
it's late Wow yeah why not

3515.94 --> 3521.52
it kind of feels to me when you describe

3519.119 --> 3524.13
it like that reminds me of how I see the

3521.52 --> 3526.95
holographic globe of the heavens it's

3524.13 --> 3529.65
just apparently there in relation to the

3526.95 --> 3532.2599999999998
observer and if you move then that

3529.65 --> 3535.4700000000003
apparent location is gonna differ in

3532.26 --> 3537.4500000000003
relation to how much you moved so it's

3535.47 --> 3540.68
always going to be the exact same side

3537.45 --> 3545.7599999999998
at the exact same position pretty much

3540.68 --> 3547.3799999999997
and yeah maybe the ether does cause that

3545.76 --> 3551.25
I don't know it's just another direction

3547.38 --> 3554.3900000000003
of thought I see arise that the lights

3551.25 --> 3559.41
are being caused as a side effect from

3554.39 --> 3564.24
high electrical effects in the upper

3559.41 --> 3566.3089999999997
atmosphere somehow yeah I mean society

3564.24 --> 3569.339
like a critical mass side effect

3566.309 --> 3574.789
electrical like a lot literally lamp in

3569.339 --> 3577.109
the sky but not but not locally it's

3574.789 --> 3578.9700000000003
yeah I don't know it's still very

3577.109 --> 3581.43
speculative on my side it's just the

3578.97 --> 3583.47
only way I'm trying to explain it this

3581.43 --> 3585.27
thing is I don't see why we fight well

3583.47 --> 3587.279
we don't actually find it too hard but

3585.27 --> 3591.119
like sometimes we get help with new

3587.279 --> 3593.99
concepts and and stuff like numbers I

3591.119 --> 3597.329
thought I want brains of designs to

3593.99 --> 3599.1299999999997
struggle with them concepts but not

3597.329 --> 3601.829
struggle with other concepts you lost

3599.13 --> 3604.26
and you know wheel me of me we've we've

3601.829 --> 3605.039
been given science through pictures with

3604.26 --> 3607.559
a globe

3605.039 --> 3609.539
Anton's electrons this is heart then

3607.559 --> 3612.119
write all these all these energies

3609.539 --> 3614.44
images more to this last week so when we

3612.119 --> 3617.2400000000002
come across being a rail

3614.44 --> 3621.23
exactly an our brains are not but

3617.24 --> 3623.75
they've not been negated

3621.23 --> 3626.029
shall we see the natural instinct or

3623.75 --> 3628.73
whether you know clerical thanking all

3626.029 --> 3632.029
that kind of stuff and analytical

3628.73 --> 3635.359
thinking and all that Kings got this

3632.029 --> 3637.91
blue don't go but they've tapped on the

3635.359 --> 3639.859
receiver then so when we received on a

3637.91 --> 3644.569
certain wave would only receive a sail

3639.859 --> 3647.42
and it was information as as I say its

3644.569 --> 3650.049
energy but it does resonate we are with

3647.42 --> 3652.579
if you show it someone they react

3650.049 --> 3655.819
chemically or whatever I don't know if

3652.579 --> 3658.51
information is energy I don't know I

3655.819 --> 3660.65
don't think so I think it definitely

3658.51 --> 3664.039
correlates with energy so when

3660.65 --> 3666.4900000000002
information arrives it's very rare that

3664.039 --> 3669.4100000000003
there's not some kind of energy response

3666.49 --> 3672.43
in correlation with it but to say

3669.41 --> 3675.3489999999997
literally it is energy no I don't know

3672.43 --> 3679.009
okay right okay energy produces

3675.349 --> 3682.4300000000003
information then but energy MA maybe it

3679.009 --> 3684.259
maybe maybe yeah maybe yeah it's

3682.43 --> 3686.5989999999997
interesting it's interesting way of

3684.259 --> 3689.48
approaching it thank you it's look the

3686.599 --> 3691.279
whole information thing God through

3689.48 --> 3694.009
quantum mechanics I have my doubts about

3691.279 --> 3696.14
it kind of but still I'm trying to

3694.009 --> 3699.38
understand that information is like a

3696.14 --> 3701.66
separate thing and I'm trying to tie it

3699.38 --> 3705.88
in with the whole network of all things

3701.66 --> 3710.39
it's just I have trouble understanding

3705.88 --> 3712.789
that well the thing is we I don't know 3

3710.39 --> 3717.16
minute video I don't know 3 minute video

3712.789 --> 3719.4500000000003
I said quantum quantum quantum physics

3717.16 --> 3722.0
explained in 3 minutes I've done it two

3719.45 --> 3724.0989999999997
years ago right and I don't I don't know

3722.0 --> 3726.799
and I actually got one of the balls a

3724.099 --> 3729.65
displayed my experiment in my example of

3726.799 --> 3732.14
a quantum physics was and he taught me

3729.65 --> 3734.049
I'd leave me he said exactly and what

3732.14 --> 3736.91
the point I was making is all about

3734.049 --> 3739.7
probability and that corner ma reason I

3736.91 --> 3741.89
don't know why he's probability is pure

3739.7 --> 3744.3799999999997
math I don't believe it not I don't

3741.89 --> 3746.72
believe it's literal there's a glassful

3744.38 --> 3748.73
mind can influence it

3746.72 --> 3750.23
you know literally you can't that's what

3748.73 --> 3752.69
they tell you if you don't know what you

3750.23 --> 3756.05
can it's proven it's scientifically

3752.69 --> 3760.4900000000002
proven with tests that you can if you

3756.05 --> 3765.26
have like specifically focus on one

3760.49 --> 3767.1499999999996
thing it will usually end up being

3765.26 --> 3769.9
balanced towards that thing

3767.15 --> 3772.73
the end result statistically it's proven

3769.9 --> 3776.569
it's so weird well no it's not it's not

3772.73 --> 3777.859
yes yes statistically yes see a lesson

3776.569 --> 3780.68
see what's happened here right you've

3777.859 --> 3782.18
you less is worrying for me about white

3780.68 --> 3784.52
people are buying in this corner fight

3782.18 --> 3786.56
it is the same people who have been

3784.52 --> 3788.66
deceived us that think they know what

3786.56 --> 3791.47
the what the ones like we have governor

3788.66 --> 3794.39
stop when they measure rate monitor as

3791.47 --> 3796.7599999999998
supposedly don't find a photon right now

3794.39 --> 3799.52
God detector no it does not detect it

3796.76 --> 3802.099
before it goes through [ __ ] look at that

3799.52 --> 3804.23
Sun hasn't okay that's another line of

3802.099 --> 3804.8590000000004
DNA has nothing to do with what I talk

3804.23 --> 3808.099
to plate

3804.859 --> 3811.22
the attention attention and expectation

3808.099 --> 3813.98
energy in Daniel says and he can

3811.22 --> 3816.109
absolutely enjoy his mouth waffle wasn't

3813.98 --> 3818.69
me this is what we do right you'll find

3816.109 --> 3820.49
out proton no it did take not fool

3818.69 --> 3822.05
tronic your red herring me I don't like

3820.49 --> 3824.569
it when you get like this what you being

3822.05 --> 3826.6090000000004
raids hitting you you're talking about

3824.569 --> 3828.589
something else you're not talking about

3826.609 --> 3829.79
and fuzz it we were talking with corn

3828.589 --> 3833.839
and fuzzy signal now we were talking

3829.79 --> 3837.109
about chance probability probability

3833.839 --> 3840.339
visit chance and I said you can

3837.109 --> 3843.609
influence that no you can like you can

3840.339 --> 3849.44
not through observation you can't

3843.609 --> 3851.66
observation no but I can tell me there's

3849.44 --> 3853.849
a chance is usually based on the change

3851.66 --> 3856.819
of some kind right right okay let me

3853.849 --> 3858.4700000000003
explain what happens in right and that's

3856.819 --> 3860.599
double slap because this is what's up

3858.47 --> 3862.819
like this probability I go I go to stamp

3860.599 --> 3866.48
out through horrible you made

3862.819 --> 3870.41
mathematics and huh oh please I get it

3866.48 --> 3873.14
no I right okay so what it is is define

3870.41 --> 3875.569
a photon in the slap now the way that

3873.14 --> 3879.23
need to take time vote on a proton or

3875.569 --> 3880.4
whatever as the Annihilator which

3879.23 --> 3884.089
creates of

3880.4 --> 3886.67
Hawthorne then the misery and if when

3884.089 --> 3887.39
they go to observer and they don't

3886.67 --> 3889.76
Hatter

3887.39 --> 3893.42
they decide oh well it wasn't the other

3889.76 --> 3895.309
is only on our site youngistan what was

3893.42 --> 3898.039
in there so it must be leo that's turn

3895.309 --> 3899.6600000000003
I've never heard of that no because

3898.039 --> 3901.099
you've never looked any you'll just

3899.66 --> 3903.589
listening like for them at ease of

3901.099 --> 3907.039
having this car that I put into this

3903.589 --> 3908.77
also over 20 years ago I've never heard

3907.039 --> 3911.48
of that

3908.77 --> 3914.109
that's example look at the experiment

3911.48 --> 3917.9
what they do well look at we didn't

3914.109 --> 3920.0589999999997
listen we did it it's cool all right

3917.9 --> 3925.1800000000003
tell me how you say to all playing off

3920.059 --> 3931.099
the experiment Oh with slits and light

3925.18 --> 3933.109
sure about these not that the quantum

3931.099 --> 3935.21
thing with the observer and everything

3933.109 --> 3939.529
that wasn't demonstrated because she can

3935.21 --> 3941.539
yeah it's not it's not a quantum eraser

3939.529 --> 3944.89
said it's not about the observation

3941.539 --> 3948.559
actually it's about the knowledge about

3944.89 --> 3951.109
information really that yeah I I don't

3948.559 --> 3953.51
understand really what that's about and

3951.109 --> 3956.18
what I mean from you I've never heard of

3953.51 --> 3958.3390000000004
that so yeah of course because he

3956.18 --> 3960.7889999999998
doesn't mention that because he thinks a

3958.339 --> 3963.44
quantum physics proves God

3960.789 --> 3966.6800000000003
yes he does and he's I've heard of

3963.44 --> 3969.7400000000002
matters for yeah he is right he is he is

3966.68 --> 3972.2599999999998
oh he's doing us as he's office getting

3969.74 --> 3974.089
to suit himself I know exactly what I've

3972.26 --> 3976.25
watched or famously chose a very

3974.089 --> 3978.2599999999998
propagation elated mechanic we need to

3976.25 --> 3979.19
the Leighton was looking account till it

3978.26 --> 3981.6800000000003
comes out my ears

3979.19 --> 3984.17
I've seen the experiments I've watched

3981.68 --> 3986.69
the lake Ozona right I haven't gone

3984.17 --> 3988.9700000000003
I haven't God you call a horse and less

3986.69 --> 3991.339
race man I'm taking an information I'll

3988.97 --> 3993.529
just pass it on her a healer writes what

3991.339 --> 3996.89
it is right now if you believe in

3993.529 --> 4001.92
quantum accordin mechanics of physics

3996.89 --> 4005.65
right you have to believe that particles

4001.92 --> 4008.619
or panel of nor wheel the spell stock

4005.65 --> 4010.809
energy and disappear again go back into

4008.619 --> 4011.8900000000003
the higgs field again now if you want to

4010.809 --> 4013.63
believe our

4011.89 --> 4016.5989999999997
that's fine to me but you really

4013.63 --> 4021.029
understand that's all speculation right

4016.599 --> 4023.1090000000004
it's so calculus it's all calculus and

4021.029 --> 4026.349
presuppositional calculus at that it's

4023.109 --> 4031.15
very fast micro presuppositional

4026.349 --> 4032.8590000000004
calculus and it's super extensive if it

4031.15 --> 4034.869
doesn't mean exactly now of course it

4032.859 --> 4038.769
doesn't it's usually a sign it's not

4034.869 --> 4040.509
accurate well just like a bullet soon I

4038.769 --> 4043.029
think you'll give it more about when you

4040.509 --> 4048.059
think there'll be less quantum but it's

4043.029 --> 4052.029
just not accurate it's extremely divided

4048.059 --> 4055.119
so it's it's wild literally it's

4052.029 --> 4059.289
extremely divided in how things are

4055.119 --> 4060.9700000000003
interpreted and here's a thing you help

4059.289 --> 4064.059
that cotton a you know they've quantum

4060.97 --> 4066.279
computers science right mm-hmm

4064.059 --> 4067.7490000000003
that well you could good watch one bow

4066.279 --> 4069.249
I'll get me out sure

4067.749 --> 4071.4399999999996
sure thing on they've got these things

4069.249 --> 4073.089
are quantum computers machine I know

4071.44 --> 4077.079
these things are pumpkin ooh and

4073.089 --> 4078.7889999999998
combination 24/7 right the scientists

4077.079 --> 4083.1090000000004
said the only problem is we don't know

4078.789 --> 4085.599
what is telling us what do you mean okay

4083.109 --> 4086.89
these things are what can happen the

4085.599 --> 4088.8900000000003
reason that it counts because it's

4086.89 --> 4092.3799999999997
pompano and formation they don't know as

4088.89 --> 4098.589
it's like trying to decode a new

4092.38 --> 4101.549
language que no no no no quantum

4098.589 --> 4105.179
computers are kind of already applied in

4101.549 --> 4108.31
our computers little walk yeah they do

4105.179 --> 4109.06
who told you like one example give me

4108.31 --> 4112.569
one example

4109.06 --> 4114.909000000001
its standard parts of computers now

4112.569 --> 4117.7300000000005
compliance I'm afraid no it's not give

4114.909 --> 4123.629999999999
me uh how does it work it works very

4117.73 --> 4127.15
weirdly it's awesome it is with a very

4123.63 --> 4129.46
subtle state that has weird side effects

4127.15 --> 4133.15
that give it like a certain kind of a

4129.46 --> 4136.75
fine a almost consciousness like sense

4133.15 --> 4140.1089999999995
and it works out it does it's got no

4136.75 --> 4143.619
consciousness no it is I'm not student

4140.109 --> 4145.27
say that consciousness like it it is it

4143.619 --> 4147.45
appears kind of ohm

4145.27 --> 4149.77
like it is consciousness it isn't

4147.45 --> 4153.28
appearance well did you get a higher of

4149.77 --> 4157.21
the issues bum was told to me and folks

4153.28 --> 4158.86
when is the consciousness hmm no I

4157.21 --> 4162.19
didn't say that

4158.86 --> 4163.8099999999995
I did not say that stop say repeating

4162.19 --> 4166.509999999999
what did you see that I said it is

4163.81 --> 4169.68
consciousness like it appears like it's

4166.51 --> 4173.1
an aberration not literal consciousness

4169.68 --> 4175.030000000001
okay yeah I said it's just effect almost

4173.1 --> 4177.55
suggesting some kind of consciousness

4175.03 --> 4180.219999999999
right okay then I already for this

4177.55 --> 4185.38
equation and what we does it suggests

4180.22 --> 4187.93
consciousness how it responds but I've

4185.38 --> 4189.88
just told you with Mike Watney computers

4187.93 --> 4192.04
the quantum computers that have got a

4189.88 --> 4194.26
pumpkinette information that they've

4192.04 --> 4197.71
know got clear water and right so what

4194.26 --> 4200.47
is your source for that information well

4197.71 --> 4203.26
from electro so a good look at a good

4200.47 --> 4204.85
finger actually quarter mechanics in our

4203.26 --> 4206.320000000001
world or some other thing that about so

4204.85 --> 4210.27
these are these are lectures of watch

4206.32 --> 4212.799999999999
from the Science Foundation or some

4210.27 --> 4216.9400000000005
theoretical physicists and stuff a song

4212.8 --> 4219.85
right sure okay guys who's your source

4216.94 --> 4222.61
I'd love to hear about it but I very

4219.85 --> 4224.85
reserved no well that's good oh I

4222.61 --> 4229.21
shouldn't be reserved about is money

4224.85 --> 4232.06
when you see or game your head the

4229.21 --> 4235.0
quantum mechanics is real I don't for

4232.06 --> 4239.620000000001
them I don't really I it's like gravity

4235.0 --> 4241.93
to me I get know how it programming to

4239.62 --> 4244.54
me I can't program but I know how it

4241.93 --> 4248.62
works literally I've seen it done so

4244.54 --> 4253.0
many times and I get how it works I

4248.62 --> 4256.63
don't I just can't really do it or the

4253.0 --> 4260.8
programming right yeah yeah I do a

4256.63 --> 4264.25
little bad I'm trying to limit no I

4260.8 --> 4269.2
don't like it that's the problem it to

4264.25 --> 4271.51
me it's like plumbing like what

4269.2 --> 4274.3
sometimes you have to do it you know but

4271.51 --> 4276.820000000001
I don't like doing it it's very annoying

4274.3 --> 4278.92
to me I'd rather be a plumber

4276.82 --> 4281.139999999999
especially if something goes wrong it's

4278.92 --> 4282.6990000000005
like I [ __ ] yeah but with the plumber

4281.14 --> 4285.04
it's kind of the same thing and now that

4282.699 --> 4286.96
you mention it it's like okay you do

4285.04 --> 4288.91
stuff but if you accidentally put

4286.96 --> 4291.37
something back wrong then you're [ __ ]

4288.91 --> 4292.84
and like the house water and [ __ ] oh

4291.37 --> 4295.63
well if you do something wrong with

4292.84 --> 4298.150000000001
programming your program is broken and

4295.63 --> 4300.04
you sometimes it can take incredible

4298.15 --> 4303.37
long times just to figure out what went

4300.04 --> 4305.7699999999995
wrong so from experience and experience

4303.37 --> 4308.8
from other programmers when I basically

4305.77 --> 4311.05
sat next to them studying them

4308.8 --> 4312.9400000000005
programming like my brother who was a

4311.05 --> 4316.33
professional programmer a very long time

4312.94 --> 4318.639999999999
I used I used to do it I used to do it

4316.33 --> 4321.01
when Elizabeth 1516 when we first bought

4318.64 --> 4323.9490000000005
must be pure I used to draw

4321.01 --> 4327.429
I used to write scripting it are a stick

4323.949 --> 4329.949
man to run over the screen or geometric

4327.429 --> 4331.96
shapes building together and spinning

4329.949 --> 4332.5
around and changing colors and stuff

4331.96 --> 4335.9800000000005
like that

4332.5 --> 4337.78
and that was nice like geez - nearly 40

4335.98 --> 4340.36
years like was up nice for 40 years of

4337.78 --> 4343.2699999999995
it fairly sexy little all right right

4340.36 --> 4346.299999999999
that's very early very early beta basic

4343.27 --> 4348.7300000000005
time basic programming the Commodore

4346.3 --> 4354.16
successful early programming PC early

4348.73 --> 4356.3099999999995
see it was UNIX unique still Wow okay

4354.16 --> 4359.38
that's extremely early yeah

4356.31 --> 4366.76
organize the last that's what a lunch

4359.38 --> 4370.81
were in terminals terminals yeah my

4366.76 --> 4375.280000000001
brother went all through that so I just

4370.81 --> 4377.29
I knew I use it I use the Linux openings

4375.28 --> 4380.41
just the one main so I get like some

4377.29 --> 4382.06
teams up here I'll open Google say up to

4380.41 --> 4383.17
I thought about that command you know on

4382.06 --> 4385.51
the command line then in the morning

4383.17 --> 4388.2390000000005
I'll just I'll just write it down until

4385.51 --> 4392.05
or if I want you to be some music I'll

4388.239 --> 4393.879999999999
just type when we're you pull up VLC and

4392.05 --> 4399.64
the nemeth the sorting get it to

4393.88 --> 4401.32
playback I never got the hang of PC PC

4399.64 --> 4403.570000000001
language busy I

4401.32 --> 4406.989
I did some fooling around with Commodore

4403.57 --> 4410.259999999999
64 basic though I even try to make

4406.989 --> 4411.428999999999
programs like very basic programs or

4410.26 --> 4413.979
just

4411.429 --> 4419.38
of ASCII animation things that kind of

4413.979 --> 4421.900000000001
stuff I mean it takes about a time but

4419.38 --> 4426.039
you know it's it seems of all kind of

4421.9 --> 4428.949
fun so it was just a digital coloring

4426.039 --> 4431.86
board in a way to me and you prep it

4428.949 --> 4433.928999999999
with code yeah that's exactly you've

4431.86 --> 4435.639
just you'll just lighten up X's on the

4433.929 --> 4439.03
scene if you're doing porn or do not

4435.639 --> 4442.619
drawn a song it's just basically a given

4439.03 --> 4445.78
commands let's pack so online for

4442.619 --> 4446.92
whatever right exactly it's just basic

4445.78 --> 4449.619
directions I don't know

4446.92 --> 4451.659
we even had in school where we were

4449.619 --> 4454.9
taught some of these basics at certain

4451.659 --> 4457.119
age it's weird not all right everybody

4454.9 --> 4460.749
got that I wasn't very good at it but

4457.119 --> 4462.179
like the early programming teachings

4460.749 --> 4464.889
were not very sucky

4462.179 --> 4469.079
you know when I was at school Arwen

4464.889 --> 4477.099
their computers were the size of a house

4469.079 --> 4480.219
yeah screen mazing yeah exactly the

4477.099 --> 4484.539
stream resumes became smaller and the

4480.219 --> 4486.76
screams became bigger and flatter you

4484.539 --> 4492.13
could and the computer was that big you

4486.76 --> 4497.409000000001
could feel the force of gravity right

4492.13 --> 4501.55
old floppy disks all right where she

4497.409 --> 4504.039
gets like bent like this signal right

4501.55 --> 4507.4890000000005
now ended their break I'm like I can't

4504.039 --> 4509.259999999999
I'm like a cake and I know and a sweetie

4507.489 --> 4510.968999999999
short man they want is technology

4509.26 --> 4512.849
because but cuz I don't remember the

4510.969 --> 4515.65
fossil computer and you know I hope

4512.849 --> 4517.9890000000005
before mobile phones and stuff like that

4515.65 --> 4520.299999999999
so let's stuff this come this bottle

4517.989 --> 4523.089999999999
reality stop I'm loving honest tech but

4520.3 --> 4525.070000000001
unfortunately there was a good say to it

4523.09 --> 4526.9890000000005
there's also less really ski and he said

4525.07 --> 4530.199
if I still love the tape is just people

4526.989 --> 4532.388999999999
who started using it but the wrong what

4530.199 --> 4535.678999999999
follow but I met Jane dance of course I

4532.389 --> 4538.749
love all the hot of course you know

4535.679 --> 4541.709
Illuminati [ __ ] is bound to pop up

4538.749 --> 4541.709
everywhere over there

4541.88 --> 4547.66
but yeah I don't have good experiences

4545.63 --> 4550.37
with virtual reality things I've had

4547.66 --> 4553.13
been through early type goggles

4550.37 --> 4556.22
they were very blocky and it got me very

4553.13 --> 4559.55
nauseous also because the what is it

4556.22 --> 4561.71
there was a delay in your in your

4559.55 --> 4564.53
orientation that makes me makes me

4561.71 --> 4567.26
extremely nauseous and it very quickly

4564.53 --> 4569.21
oh right yeah yeah it was still in the

4567.26 --> 4571.34
early stage they probably work this out

4569.21 --> 4573.68
probably the resolution this time is a

4571.34 --> 4575.33
lot better it's still gonna be somewhat

4573.68 --> 4577.490000000001
lucky like a slight blur but not

4575.33 --> 4581.15
terrible and I expect they have the

4577.49 --> 4582.469999999999
orientation thing fixed because I'm not

4581.15 --> 4588.41
gonna be the only one that's gonna have

4582.47 --> 4592.6900000000005
to have had problems from that yeah I so

4588.41 --> 4592.69
it is not my thing anymore you know I

4593.02 --> 4599.81
actually enjoy the real world much more

4595.76 --> 4602.96
now than if I mean for gaming I'm a no

4599.81 --> 4605.06
gamer I'm an old game I kind of thing

4602.96 --> 4607.7
and my games for like shooting games and

4605.06 --> 4610.43
driving that was old right just war aims

4607.7 --> 4612.11
not their ones with fees and guns and

4610.43 --> 4615.02
like just normal with the normal guns

4612.11 --> 4616.429999999999
and in zooming about the forest and

4615.02 --> 4618.620000000001
stuff like that none of that in you

4616.43 --> 4620.360000000001
stuff but the driving games some of the

4618.62 --> 4623.0599999999995
virtual reality is fun you can actually

4620.36 --> 4624.91
tell they got really good early on like

4623.06 --> 4628.490000000001
the driving games become hyper realistic

4624.91 --> 4631.19
very er 9 oh my god and they were

4628.49 --> 4635.86
driving it wasn't driver like the first

4631.19 --> 4637.79
3d engine based game even ever to pop up

4635.86 --> 4640.2699999999995
what could that be nicely

4637.79 --> 4644.0
yeah driver eyes like yeah with our

4640.27 --> 4647.3
extremely ugly polygons but it was like

4644.0 --> 4649.97
the engine based game that was public I

4647.3 --> 4652.1
think somewhere in the usual back years

4649.97 --> 4654.320000000001
man look at them now it's late you can

4652.1 --> 4657.02
set actually and then a seat that

4654.32 --> 4660.98
vibrates and gives you g-forces you know

4657.02 --> 4665.990000000001
please the engines in like utility web

4660.98 --> 4668.0599999999995
utility pop ups yes it's absolutely

4665.99 --> 4669.92
crazy I mean that's what I'm seen I get

4668.06 --> 4671.51
really I'm excited about it because I

4669.92 --> 4674.54
remember the beginning they take you

4671.51 --> 4675.26
know I love you know I love the tail

4674.54 --> 4677.57
look of always

4675.26 --> 4679.67
interested in science or technical

4677.57 --> 4681.409
science and everything you know I mean

4679.67 --> 4684.289
I've always thought to me it's like this

4681.409 --> 4686.299999999999
is an amazing time for me because it

4684.289 --> 4688.88
because of the factors all the stuff you

4686.3 --> 4691.7300000000005
know the brain brains name it's a time

4688.88 --> 4694.429
of modules this is for a programmer

4691.73 --> 4698.69
biggest problem is now overseeing things

4694.429 --> 4702.079
because yeah module box you can module

4698.69 --> 4704.329
everything technically you don't even

4702.079 --> 4705.889
need to type a single word maybe a

4704.329 --> 4708.32
couple of connecting lines or

4705.889 --> 4710.21
corrections but you can just module

4708.32 --> 4712.579
everything and that was even ten years

4710.21 --> 4716.78
ago so I can barely imagine what's out

4712.579 --> 4719.449
there right now it's just insane problem

4716.78 --> 4721.909
is having oversight over at all it's

4719.449 --> 4725.388999999999
just there's so much so many ways you

4721.909 --> 4727.429
can approach everything yeah and it's

4725.389 --> 4728.57
just unfortunate that those people will

4727.429 --> 4732.769
not and when you use it for the

4728.57 --> 4733.369
destruction and the enforce take over

4732.769 --> 4737.2390000000005
the world

4733.369 --> 4740.989
I know it's a sneaky backdoor trickery

4737.239 --> 4743.239
stuff that kind well you know that a you

4740.989 --> 4744.919999999999
know that would you call after loads of

4743.239 --> 4748.638999999999
bank the wasn't every computers got a

4744.92 --> 4750.8
bank doing everything right you know in

4748.639 --> 4752.900000000001
learning I give up you know I started

4750.8 --> 4754.6990000000005
looking and day when I first go any can

4752.9 --> 4757.75
spell is he's a bit seven years ago I

4754.699 --> 4763.07
like to read so I was going in a the

4757.75 --> 4764.989
financial a finite financial in the

4763.07 --> 4766.759999999999
books they have counts of NASA and

4764.989 --> 4769.489
seeing what about curtains bangs on it

4766.76 --> 4771.4400000000005
okay see who the money was go I'm used

4769.489 --> 4773.69
to follow the money and I always ended

4771.44 --> 4775.61
up in the Caymans somewhere for some

4773.69 --> 4778.518999999999
ways than you know I mean there is like

4775.61 --> 4780.199
of course yeah you know and and I

4778.519 --> 4784.519
started making videos and they are Stein

4780.199 --> 4786.5
getting paranoid like oh my god I'm

4784.519 --> 4789.019
gonna they're gonna kill me you know

4786.5 --> 4791.179
like I've got 33 sobs enough you know I

4789.019 --> 4793.579000000001
mean I'm gonna they're gonna kill me I

4791.179 --> 4795.53
honestly good I'd then I got I said I

4793.579 --> 4797.599
just love laughing about it like I

4795.53 --> 4800.78
honestly got to the point name and I

4797.599 --> 4802.82
think I totally get you when I first

4800.78 --> 4806.75
started making Flat Earth videos how do

4802.82 --> 4809.0
you think I felt I was nervous I was

4806.75 --> 4811.67
nervous for starters but I was little

4809.0 --> 4814.76
like suppressing like we're distant

4811.67 --> 4816.38
vision religion visions just were

4814.76 --> 4818.72
popping up during that time and it was

4816.38 --> 4822.17
like mortified in general I was like oh

4818.72 --> 4823.13
my god I'm gonna die but I can't I can't

4822.17 --> 4826.4800000000005
stop this

4823.13 --> 4828.9400000000005
I have to do this I can't stop any but I

4826.48 --> 4832.389999999999
literally mortifying

4828.94 --> 4835.91
but I just had to do it I had to do it

4832.39 --> 4837.83
yep especially because of the timing I

4835.91 --> 4840.4
couldn't wait like another year for that

4837.83 --> 4843.65
kind of thing I just had to do it then

4840.4 --> 4845.15
the last thing with us well what what if

4843.65 --> 4846.74
like we've gotta remember is rape you've

4845.15 --> 4849.74
been getting a settlement and permeation

4846.74 --> 4851.75
rate and we fainting that's level it

4849.74 --> 4854.719999999999
took me it took me about a minute

4851.75 --> 4857.9
dissociate the one who's one of OC five

4854.72 --> 4860.35
minutes to actually agree or four but

4857.9 --> 4862.4
and then but the problem is the ammonia

4860.35 --> 4864.89
information because I like even their

4862.4 --> 4866.2699999999995
main an information that flood joy flood

4864.89 --> 4868.490000000001
your brain your brain goes and you

4866.27 --> 4871.64
overpriced my new wonder people start in

4868.49 --> 4873.5
about paranoid or affected or trauma to

4871.64 --> 4875.4800000000005
an easement right suddenly they get

4873.5 --> 4876.19
activated in ways they've never been

4875.48 --> 4878.419999999999
before

4876.19 --> 4881.57
exactly they're using different parts of

4878.42 --> 4883.9400000000005
our brain suddenly alright but you know

4881.57 --> 4884.75
I mean about analyzing critical thinking

4883.94 --> 4886.759999999999
we don't get taller

4884.75 --> 4888.5
suddenly were getting we've got this new

4886.76 --> 4891.59
feeling we don't even know what well a

4888.5 --> 4894.17
lot people maybe don't know what is for

4891.59 --> 4896.900000000001
me it's going back to school that's how

4894.17 --> 4898.9400000000005
I exactly exactly like the the good

4896.9 --> 4903.799999999999
school period which is pretty much

4898.94 --> 4906.2
between my 14th and my 19th where I did

4903.8 --> 4910.91
really pay a lot of attention it really

4906.2 --> 4912.44
did take it serious I'll also drop and

4910.91 --> 4914.42
then the not dropped out of school but

4912.44 --> 4918.29
like was playing games all the time not

4914.42 --> 4920.68
visiting school eventually in school

4918.29 --> 4923.51
playing games in school but I just

4920.68 --> 4926.42
didn't need so much focus on it to do it

4923.51 --> 4930.05
right and back then I learned so much

4926.42 --> 4932.33
and through other people like really

4930.05 --> 4936.08
smart people that were kind of like

4932.33 --> 4938.21
using me like who finally somebody I can

4936.08 --> 4940.01
talk to that actually understands in

4938.21 --> 4942.17
depth what I'm talking about and can

4940.01 --> 4942.62
respond to it because there were some

4942.17 --> 4944.27
really

4942.62 --> 4947.42
smart people out there in that school

4944.27 --> 4950.4800000000005
and I learned so much because of all of

4947.42 --> 4953.06
it and it's really a grab back to that

4950.48 --> 4956.589999999999
to that intensity to like you're really

4953.06 --> 4959.75
figuring it out by your own standards

4956.59 --> 4962.42
yeah and nobody's nobody's gonna tell

4959.75 --> 4964.04
you how to learn that mentality was very

4962.42 --> 4966.56
much present in that school it's really

4964.04 --> 4969.37
a thing for yourself type of school

4966.56 --> 4971.780000000001
where I did go where that was encouraged

4969.37 --> 4974.03
well as I told you before what I've been

4971.78 --> 4978.7699999999995
and T and Lenny what's against Flat

4974.03 --> 4982.04
Earth of course yeah yeah we're not open

4978.77 --> 4985.85
to that now I go from five find you five

4982.04 --> 4989.63
years old - 11 12 years old was ma

4985.85 --> 4992.240000000001
where's my GP last I can actually look

4989.63 --> 4995.18
back in that and be so glad I went to my

4992.24 --> 4998.12
primary school and the teachers that

4995.18 --> 4999.8
I've got and then after 12 year old

4998.12 --> 5001.18
I told you before when he's saying that

4999.8 --> 5003.1
he school and I was just I just sell up

5001.18 --> 5005.17
the back and just they dreamed all day I

5003.1 --> 5006.22
could be bored we're just you had

5005.17 --> 5008.17
nothing for me

5006.22 --> 5010.3
you know nothing for me everyone I don't

5008.17 --> 5013.18
see the point of it I never I went you

5010.3 --> 5017.41
know what I think I think are a dog

5013.18 --> 5022.27
school once and the whole time I was at

5017.41 --> 5022.72
the you know from the 12 to 16 16 year

5022.27 --> 5026.080000000001
old I think

5022.72 --> 5029.29
a dog school once all the rest of things

5026.08 --> 5033.28
I've just waited for oranges hmm I think

5029.29 --> 5036.01
my favorite subject was cooking right oh

5033.28 --> 5038.86
is that food nutrition it was cold but

5036.01 --> 5042.91
I've never been one for cooking like I

5038.86 --> 5044.83
didn't really like it until I started to

5042.91 --> 5047.38
get into organic food and figure it out

5044.83 --> 5049.0599999999995
like oh yeah prefab [ __ ] is really bad

5047.38 --> 5051.7300000000005
for you and I already kind of

5049.06 --> 5054.76
experienced that but I was ignoring it

5051.73 --> 5056.98
like a typical teenager and all that and

5054.76 --> 5059.17
once I really figured it out the

5056.98 --> 5061.209999999999
importance it was almost punishing and

5059.17 --> 5062.9800000000005
just like yeah oh [ __ ] I have to do it

5061.21 --> 5064.93
right but with the promise like okay if

5062.98 --> 5065.379999999999
I do it right I'll actually feel a lot

5064.93 --> 5069.610000000001
better

5065.38 --> 5072.9400000000005
and then are become more capable less

5069.61 --> 5074.308999999999
burdened in order to well develop myself

5072.94 --> 5076.949
more

5074.309 --> 5081.570000000001
instead of being stunted by the the bad

5076.949 --> 5084.96
[ __ ] and I did it and then I really

5081.57 --> 5087.96
stuck to it and it ended did work

5084.96 --> 5091.59
definitely no will fly off self negates

5087.96 --> 5093.57
you to look at yourself doesn't you know

5091.59 --> 5095.6990000000005
I mean internally you know I've lived

5093.57 --> 5097.469
I've learned a good buy well it wasn't

5095.699 --> 5102.48
about Flat Earth I I started eating

5097.469 --> 5105.84
organic in 2006 so now wait thoughts on

5102.48 --> 5107.339999999999
the studio now Flat Earth definitely

5105.84 --> 5110.309
does that as well but look Flat Earth

5107.34 --> 5112.079
came to me when I've already been

5110.309 --> 5115.1990000000005
confronted with flattered several times

5112.079 --> 5117.5
and I was really ready for it that's why

5115.199 --> 5120.03
I said I like I I was mortified

5117.5 --> 5122.52
literally from weird Associated but I

5120.03 --> 5127.88
had to do it and was totally ready for

5122.52 --> 5130.8
it I didn't go on the YouTube like

5127.88 --> 5132.9890000000005
hesitantly like oh maybe I shouldn't be

5130.8 --> 5136.59
do it no I was like yeah I'm gonna be

5132.989 --> 5140.669999999999
here like I was born to do this

5136.59 --> 5144.329
almost well mama foster like my first

5140.67 --> 5147.539
hangout was or who was it was I think it

5144.329 --> 5150.539
was on 4th it was was a free channel 4

5147.539 --> 5156.539
channel company but probably was a house

5150.539 --> 5158.88
key and a rebel rebel right right Molly

5156.539 --> 5161.759999999999
old school or the old crew crew from

5158.88 --> 5164.039
that was kinda math boss and then it was

5161.76 --> 5166.619000000001
about all in fact my first hangout was

5164.039 --> 5169.8
on Dale's they'll hang and then even

5166.619 --> 5173.25
know how Darwin I went I didn't even

5169.8 --> 5176.309
know hangouts existed but bind yields me

5173.25 --> 5177.42
I didn't even know they existed and then

5176.309 --> 5179.9400000000005
I found out and then

5177.42 --> 5182.7300000000005
someone told me I got I got a say oh you

5179.94 --> 5185.28
should born as a sports kind they ever

5182.73 --> 5187.0199999999995
as a Scottish guy you mention he does

5185.28 --> 5187.59
hang high notes enough and I was like

5187.02 --> 5189.3
right [ __ ]

5187.59 --> 5191.55
I'm good and I just there was my ha

5189.3 --> 5195.59
state more into it I love buying there

5191.55 --> 5195.59
we go that was me breaking my cherry

5196.219 --> 5199.9800000000005
that's funny it

5198.059 --> 5203.070000000001
yeah I didn't know about hangouts either

5199.98 --> 5205.739
before pretty much took note of mark

5203.07 --> 5207.03
Sargent and Patricia steer and they

5205.739 --> 5209.339999999999
doing hangouts and

5207.03 --> 5212.179
and was like hey wait this is out there

5209.34 --> 5215.610000000001
this is high-tech he was like oh wow

5212.179 --> 5218.4
yeah group video is life that was like

5215.61 --> 5219.869
so fresh and oh my god I want to be part

5218.4 --> 5223.92
of this it wasn't really like a gold

5219.869 --> 5225.75
rush to that they hang out thing yeah it

5223.92 --> 5228.599
always that's exactly what I always like

5225.75 --> 5230.159
and then from day Lord I came to wait on

5228.599 --> 5233.909000000001
a few times out of a bucket that's

5230.159 --> 5235.679
something I'm gonna start myself and of

5233.909 --> 5238.049999999999
course they're like this is my thought

5235.679 --> 5240.36
channel I don't have the lead to

5238.05 --> 5243.900000000001
probably about $200 but he was only

5240.36 --> 5245.67
there Nassau the Illuminati symbolism

5243.9 --> 5247.739
all that kind of stuff

5245.67 --> 5250.92
I just got totally Jeff I gave that

5247.739 --> 5253.11
Arwen right you just got you just can't

5250.92 --> 5254.849
be ball out this it's just you don't

5253.11 --> 5257.759999999999
want to do hang out she can't be bored

5254.849 --> 5260.909000000001
looking at anything it's just no ii know

5257.76 --> 5264.659000000001
what never know oh my god

5260.909 --> 5266.848999999999
yesterday a bit but no it's not it no

5264.659 --> 5269.848999999999
actually yesterday I was really missing

5266.849 --> 5273.329
it it was like [ __ ] I didn't I have to

5269.849 --> 5275.400000000001
do it like I was still anticipating

5273.329 --> 5276.78
going life but it just moved on until

5275.4 --> 5280.829
the evening dance like there's something

5276.78 --> 5283.349
wrong I didn't do a hangout I think it's

5280.829 --> 5285.719
the regulation that was was up day it

5283.349 --> 5287.4890000000005
was a fake to me because always I do

5285.719 --> 5289.32
read didn't like me now I would get on

5287.489 --> 5291.75
information but people that will not say

5289.32 --> 5294.389
it not Rees I was all fit or not this is

5291.75 --> 5297.449
what science is nice you know I said

5294.389 --> 5299.7300000000005
well you have to understand what you

5297.449 --> 5302.098999999999
will have tell me to noise clap or at

5299.73 --> 5305.369
least looking at it or at least if you

5302.099 --> 5306.84
want to talk to these guys are so so so

5305.369 --> 5308.339999999999
qualified and I you have to know a

5306.84 --> 5309.78
little bit about your subject and know

5308.34 --> 5311.639
the questions to ask

5309.78 --> 5313.38
ain't nothing and if you don't know the

5311.639 --> 5314.25
subject you can't just go speculating

5313.38 --> 5314.639
because they've just wrecked me to

5314.25 --> 5316.679
pieces

5314.639 --> 5318.42
mmm-hmm and that was really awful so you

5316.679 --> 5320.429
know I mean I had done about what's

5318.42 --> 5323.1900000000005
experiences really fly off but I've had

5320.429 --> 5325.77
more enjoyment on ball health panels

5323.19 --> 5328.23
just for the fact that I just that meant

5325.77 --> 5330.900000000001
to be representing me show not mean call

5328.23 --> 5333.449
me oh I don't expect it coming from

5330.9 --> 5335.82
flieth was just because maybe map I mean

5333.449 --> 5337.768999999999
wasn't that I bet definite I thought god

5335.82 --> 5339.869
I thought that was I thought I thought

5337.769 --> 5341.669
that was the whole point of us being

5339.869 --> 5343.589
in flight because what critical thinkers

5341.669 --> 5345.51
you know you can thank Feder my boring

5343.589 --> 5349.079
and something I'm getting accused of

5345.51 --> 5352.649
being an agent it's not that's so funny

5349.079 --> 5355.739
yeah I'm breaking in but I have similar

5352.649 --> 5358.079000000001
responses as well like now I'm much more

5355.739 --> 5360.898999999999
reserved in in approaching everyone as

5358.079 --> 5364.53
individuals and almost like kind of like

5360.899 --> 5367.499000000001
a psychiatrist but not too pushy I try

5364.53 --> 5369.839
not to be too pushy but back then like

5367.499 --> 5372.539
especially the first year I couldn't

5369.839 --> 5377.099
stand the glowers I was literally

5372.539 --> 5379.679
foaming at the mouth hating them behind

5377.099 --> 5382.05
the keyboard where's she at times and

5379.679 --> 5382.76
going totally nuts over it that was so

5382.05 --> 5387.7390000000005
weird

5382.76 --> 5390.899
but I guess it might have been I say

5387.739 --> 5392.8189999999995
venting frustration in general also

5390.899 --> 5395.849
because it yeah pretty much was a period

5392.819 --> 5398.639
after my ex broke up with me a year

5395.849 --> 5401.309
after that and flattered suddenly

5398.639 --> 5403.289
hitting me and weird vision stuff so we

5401.309 --> 5405.629
had a lot of frustration so I was hating

5403.289 --> 5409.53
and foaming at the mouth a lot back then

5405.629 --> 5411.649
just really angry glad I didn't show any

5409.53 --> 5415.438999999999
of that on camera by the way except

5411.649 --> 5417.839
except for 82 that Darwin's yeah not

5415.439 --> 5421.679
right you had obviously even though

5417.839 --> 5424.26
people were making me a music or station

5421.679 --> 5426.749
money always I was good yeah oh and go

5424.26 --> 5428.909000000001
out at me T I totally got it man

5426.749 --> 5431.76
I totally knew you were coming from man

5428.909 --> 5435.058999999999
you know it was weird it was literally

5431.76 --> 5437.569
like going to war there was just only me

5435.059 --> 5441.929
appearing around me and I was like yeah

5437.569 --> 5447.479
like I just couldn't hold back anymore I

5441.929 --> 5450.379
was so yeah so the last spirits like too

5447.479 --> 5452.219
many painful images shoving him

5450.379 --> 5455.959
sufficiently tortured

5452.219 --> 5458.519
it was tortured and it just went berserk

5455.959 --> 5460.559
and I tried to sort of controlled

5458.519 --> 5464.309
berserk but it was barely a control

5460.559 --> 5469.319
really just made sure I was not you

5464.309 --> 5471.51
being good go man get it I love the I

5469.319 --> 5473.099
love the hum of people Wendy Cola and

5471.51 --> 5476.129
everything you said

5473.099 --> 5480.119000000001
everything you said was played but not

5476.129 --> 5482.309
maybe not about the well actually yeah

5480.119 --> 5484.558999999999
good can die in stuff like that yeah

5482.309 --> 5488.729
actually when I think about it that was

5484.559 --> 5491.76
mm-hmm what sorry I was seen Quinn you

5488.729 --> 5493.019
were seeing just go die yeah but you

5491.76 --> 5496.05
know when you were talking I mean we're

5493.019 --> 5496.939
talking about the that thing when you

5496.05 --> 5499.9490000000005
out

5496.939 --> 5502.59
expressing your frustration it's sailing

5499.949 --> 5504.419
things yeah I was basically saying like

5502.59 --> 5507.209
we have to go out on the streets and

5504.419 --> 5508.429
just kill them all basically kill them

5507.209 --> 5510.929
all

5508.429 --> 5513.359
yeah but I wasn't I was being very

5510.929 --> 5516.51
specific sound not just pedophiles in

5513.359 --> 5518.969
general I was at first that was the case

5516.51 --> 5521.070000000001
but then I just like as I'm going

5518.969 --> 5524.369
berserk I'm also looking at like yeah

5521.07 --> 5525.749
you know not all of them are truly evil

5524.369 --> 5528.148999999999
some of them really keep it to

5525.749 --> 5530.188999999999
themselves guys you're gonna kill them

5528.149 --> 5532.499000000001
as well so I was just like okay it's

5530.189 --> 5534.749000000001
just those freaking judges you know the

5532.499 --> 5539.07
court system there are some really nasty

5534.749 --> 5541.079
freakin dungeon PTO's in there that are

5539.07 --> 5545.398999999999
just so corrupted in it so I was like

5541.079 --> 5548.728999999999
okay just them yeah them there are the

5545.399 --> 5551.399
targets and probably as I kind of

5548.729 --> 5555.209
predicted like it's being pushed towards

5551.399 --> 5559.169000000001
that you know yeah okay if they're gonna

5555.209 --> 5562.139
keep on being where they are doing what

5559.169 --> 5565.519
they do as they do and the pressure is

5562.139 --> 5569.459
gonna amp up yeah it's just gonna break

5565.519 --> 5572.219
or think it : I think it cool I won't be

5569.459 --> 5574.438999999999
doing it in LA yeah there'll be a lot of

5572.219 --> 5576.3
people at school named because I owe my

5574.439 --> 5581.070000000001
preferences I know any killing so I

5576.3 --> 5583.109
don't believe in a Motorola that's not I

5581.07 --> 5585.719
know where you go let's him not even go

5583.109 --> 5589.079000000001
in that direction but I know I know I'm

5585.719 --> 5595.399
not into killing either but it it would

5589.079 --> 5598.648999999999
just be a sub civilization situation

5595.399 --> 5600.570000000001
basically your resolve the thing is

5598.649 --> 5600.780000000001
right right two wrongs don't make a

5600.57 --> 5603.268999999999
right

5600.78 --> 5605.53
what are we exactly exactly that's a big

5603.269 --> 5608.47
problem but you can't just

5605.53 --> 5610.21
please write while we do is retained an

5608.47 --> 5612.400000000001
island in the middle and or we on any

5610.21 --> 5614.62
weed dumpling that's at some points I

5612.4 --> 5617.2
would gather them I would probably give

5614.62 --> 5620.7699999999995
them you know survival tools like a

5617.2 --> 5622.84
knife perhaps but that might probably be

5620.77 --> 5624.52
about a knife and they would have to do

5622.84 --> 5626.38
the rest and then everybody that got

5624.52 --> 5626.860000000001
anything out just put them on they see

5626.38 --> 5629.88
my own

5626.86 --> 5633.099999999999
bang-bang-bang and just leave them to it

5629.88 --> 5636.7
killing each other that's who kills I

5633.1 --> 5641.47
never killed them no but although that's

5636.7 --> 5643.599999999999
not that's kind of devious you know no

5641.47 --> 5646.27
it's no no that's justice my friend I'm

5643.6 --> 5650.14
near Karma if I do you know it's

5646.27 --> 5650.77
literally throwing them in the wild it's

5650.14 --> 5653.62
weird

5650.77 --> 5656.17
I don't know I'd prefer their so I'd

5653.62 --> 5658.14
prefer they I don't know maybe they

5656.17 --> 5660.91
should be subject of cycle heavy

5658.14 --> 5664.33
psychological study and just like let's

5660.91 --> 5671.0199999999995
see what this is can this be corrected

5664.33 --> 5676.0
or like I don't know it's very difficult

5671.02 --> 5677.320000000001
to know I want the Monon Island kill

5676.0 --> 5679.75
themselves they kill themselves I don't

5677.32 --> 5681.73
kill I have no idea they're gonna gate

5679.75 --> 5684.01
they'll be they'll be killing themselves

5681.73 --> 5687.099999999999
but right well there's a great

5684.01 --> 5690.1900000000005
likelihood that once these people lose

5687.1 --> 5692.110000000001
their power seat many of them will

5690.19 --> 5694.2699999999995
probably kill themselves because they

5692.11 --> 5697.21
will be dragged through the mud so badly

5694.27 --> 5699.55
they just wouldn't want money just the

5697.21 --> 5704.02
outlook of that would probably drag them

5699.55 --> 5706.6
to suicide anyway once that [ __ ] goes

5704.02 --> 5708.3
down so maybe I just maybe you won't

5706.6 --> 5712.450000000001
even have to do anything

5708.3 --> 5714.400000000001
yah I hope that that does you who died

5712.45 --> 5716.53
one because that's going to be really

5714.4 --> 5718.929999999999
horrible I don't kill it's gonna be it's

5716.53 --> 5721.48
gonna be or that's the problem it's

5718.93 --> 5723.58
that's the whole angle to it

5721.48 --> 5726.9
it's like if they're gonna keep on

5723.58 --> 5729.28
pushing and pushing it it will it

5726.9 --> 5731.7699999999995
terrible things will happen one way or

5729.28 --> 5734.69
the other you know it's just the

5731.77 --> 5740.540000000001
pressure let's let's

5734.69 --> 5742.19
let's leave it to the Mafia yeah I kind

5740.54 --> 5745.13
of wanted to write on to show it's been

5742.19 --> 5746.928999999999

5745.13 --> 5748.37
