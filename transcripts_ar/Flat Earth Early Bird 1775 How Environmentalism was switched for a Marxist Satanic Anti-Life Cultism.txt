[Music]

291.72 --> 298.56

296.0 --> 301.56
what okay that's just weird

298.56 --> 301.56
teret

307.24 --> 313.6
but yeah I guess that it YouTube's kind

309.44 --> 313.6
of glitching or something with

313.759 --> 319.16
this cuz I'm pretty damn sure I just

316.16 --> 319.16
started five minutes

328.479 --> 333.08
ago

330.53 --> 336.0
[Music]

333.08 --> 338.639

336.0 --> 340.919
definitely getting colder and I am it is

338.639 --> 343.28000000000003
annoying but I mean I'm basically

340.919 --> 346.56
adapting through diet and

343.28 --> 350.15999999999997
now eating more potatoes and

346.56 --> 352.8
more butter based gravy I mean I I'm

350.16 --> 356.91900000000004
eating it more than I

352.8 --> 359.6
have like say two months ago and it is

356.919 --> 361.84
it works I mean it works fine if if you

359.6 --> 363.91900000000004
do that

361.84 --> 366.67999999999995
like yeah you don't have to be in a

363.919 --> 370.35999999999996
heated home like

366.68 --> 373.28000000000003
that you can still get

370.36 --> 377.52000000000004
around although I do use my heat lamp

373.28 --> 379.4
thing but I mean it's not that super

377.52 --> 384.4
useful I mean it it does keep it a

379.4 --> 384.4
little warm but actually warm

385.199 --> 391.40000000000003
no I would have to like turn on all the

387.68 --> 391.40000000000003
lamps or something I'm not doing that

397.479 --> 399.8
low

398.28 --> 402.11999999999995
clutch

399.8 --> 402.8
potatoes boil them mash them put them in

402.12 --> 406.039
a

402.8 --> 406.039
stew yeah

411.4 --> 414.4
yeah

418.16 --> 422.84000000000003
okay okay borders boy I guess you're

420.96 --> 426.19899999999996
into bikes but I

422.84 --> 428.63899999999995
mean my bike's just a piece of [ __ ] I

426.199 --> 428.639
mean

436.0 --> 442.199
literally it's like oh it's it's nothing

439.68 --> 444.52
special model it's already been like

442.199 --> 446.319
reassembled it's just a piece of [ __ ]

444.52 --> 447.87899999999996
and I want my bike to look like a piece

446.319 --> 451.319
of [ __ ] because then nobody's going to

447.879 --> 451.319
think of stealing it

462.56 --> 467.0
right but as long as it works that's all

464.879 --> 467.0
I

467.28 --> 472.44
need I'm probably going to need some

469.52 --> 475.08
repairs on my bike soon too besides the

472.44 --> 477.28
tire cuz the steering is getting like

475.08 --> 479.039
kind of stuck I think like yeah it's

477.28 --> 480.44
going to like freeze up at some point

479.039 --> 481.4
kind of dangerous you know when you're

480.44 --> 483.319
on the

481.4 --> 485.63899999999995
street you don't want your steering

483.319 --> 488.8
wheel to freeze up and that could happen

485.639 --> 488.8
at some point I got to be

497.09 --> 502.31899999999996
[Music]

499.319 --> 505.03900000000004

502.319 --> 507.599

1114.84 --> 1118.72
why I'm so [ __ ] sick of

1119.08 --> 1127.24
it like the whole oh like I I'd say I

1123.799 --> 1130.48
would be Pro Palestine but the thing

1127.24 --> 1133.36
is they're like a political

1130.48 --> 1136.559
movement just like black lives matter or

1133.36 --> 1139.4399999999998
something or the Muslim Brotherhood it's

1136.559 --> 1143.2
like I'm not going to [ __ ] side with

1139.44 --> 1145.679
those pieces of [ __ ] yeah they're

like you guys are

1159.08 --> 1163.76

1163.76 --> 1169.32
hor [ __ ] with Ukraine which are like

1166.4 --> 1172.3200000000002
blatantly Nazis in there and everything

1172.32 --> 1178.6399999999999
go side with Palestine I mean maybe

1175.08 --> 1181.76
there's like another dual conflict that

1178.64 --> 1185.7990000000002
could spring up where like both parties

1181.76 --> 1189.559
are just the most demonic de

1185.799 --> 1194.08
depraved disgusting repulsive evil

1189.559 --> 1196.48

1196.48 --> 1202.559
to pick aide because it's going on yeah

1200.159 --> 1205.96

1202.559 --> 1209.2
the slightly less [ __ ] disgusting

1205.96 --> 1212.28
demon devil

1209.2 --> 1215.6000000000001

2425.359 --> 2431.31
alone

2428.12 --> 2431.31
[Music]

2433.24 --> 2436.8799999999997
right I'm kind of fired up today it

2450.24 --> 2455.04
seems hope the video is working out by

2455.319 --> 2458.319
now

2465.119 --> 2470.76
right s star but I mean it's fair enough

2467.839 --> 2474.24
to say that right I mean are you guys

2470.76 --> 2475.6800000000003
now are you still laughing about Rhino

2474.24 --> 2478.4799999999996
over

2475.68 --> 2482.359
there the [ __ ] whst

2478.48 --> 2482.359
environmentalist activist

2483.079 --> 2490.7200000000003
idiot yeah and I'm a big environment

2486.44 --> 2494.4
list I love green I love it I love

2490.72 --> 2497.72
plants you know I love them a lot I love

2494.4 --> 2502.839
animals you know what I love most about

2497.72 --> 2505.2799999999997
it if you have a lot of CO2 they get

2502.839 --> 2505.2799999999997
more

2505.319 --> 2513.04
plants yeah that's why I

2508.599 --> 2517.04
hate this freaking carbon shortage and

2513.04 --> 2521.56
this disgusting polluting Giant battery

2517.04 --> 2524.319
based cars you know how much like toxic

2521.56 --> 2526.24
waste you end up with thanks to this

2524.319 --> 2529.8
[ __ ] electric

2526.24 --> 2532.4399999999996
cars yeah they all have to be charged

2529.8 --> 2535.4
usually by burning fossil fuels anyway

2532.44 --> 2538.56
just at a centralized station so you can

2535.4 --> 2540.88
have that charge like making massive

2538.56 --> 2544.72
energy losses because that's usually

2540.88 --> 2548.359
what happens yeah when it's not just H

2544.72 --> 2550.72
when the ngg process isn't like directly

2548.359 --> 2554.4
on location oh oh yeah you have to have

2550.72 --> 2557.16
a charging station and then like battery

2554.4 --> 2560.4
from the car charging station charging

2557.16 --> 2563.16
station electric station from the

2560.4 --> 2564.8
electric station to the power generation

2563.16 --> 2567.7599999999998
oh guess what happens at the power

2564.8 --> 2572.48
generation oh yeah yeah they burn fuel

2567.76 --> 2575.1600000000003
yeah and that way you effectively burn

2572.48 --> 2577.48
the same oh did I say the same no no

2575.16 --> 2581.44
more like 20

2577.48 --> 2585.0
amounts of the same amount of fuel for

2581.44 --> 2587.8
the same amount of thrust in your little

2585.0 --> 2590.4
electric engine you [ __ ]

2587.8 --> 2594.76
retards

2590.4 --> 2596.0
yeah it's idiotic environmentalists are

2594.76 --> 2598.8
[ __ ]

2596.0 --> 2601.52
[ __ ] they're

2598.8 --> 2604.2400000000002
satanic they don't get it they don't get

2601.52 --> 2609.04
that everything they do is

2604.24 --> 2612.52
bad you can't have a hyper technological

2609.04 --> 2616.0
modernist Society of [ __ ] yuppies and

2612.52 --> 2617.319
be environmentalist yeah you're an if

you're an environmental you know what

2617.319 --> 2623.64
you are you're a [ __ ]

2619.119 --> 2626.2400000000002
hippie yeah hippies don't do that crap

they don't get into Financial

2626.24 --> 2633.2799999999997
scams yeah they actually take care of

2630.359 --> 2635.48
things that's not what you are you're

2633.28 --> 2638.2000000000003
not an environmentalist you're a [ __ ]

2635.48 --> 2641.359
Satanist pretending to be a [ __ ]

2638.2 --> 2646.9199999999996
environmentalist yeah just another

2641.359 --> 2650.72
[ __ ] masked grabler again like always

2646.92 --> 2650.7200000000003
yeah you're not helping

2651.4 --> 2657.48
nature you're not helping nature with

2654.04 --> 2662.319
these [ __ ] environmentalist

2657.48 --> 2662.319
scams at all you're not helping it at

2665.0 --> 2671.28
all yeah look at all these freaking

2668.88 --> 2673.52
windmill Berry

2671.28 --> 2677.6400000000003
sites you already

2673.52 --> 2682.24
got yeah there disgusting chunks of

2677.64 --> 2682.24
plastic that can't be

2682.319 --> 2687.079
recycled oh you thought they were just

2684.4 --> 2689.4
going to sit there forever oh we're just

2687.079 --> 2692.52
going to produce this clean energy oh

2689.4 --> 2697.4
yeah but they break down though and then

2692.52 --> 2701.359
you have a gigantic amount of unre aable

2697.4 --> 2704.839
plastic yay we're so environmentally

2701.359 --> 2704.839
friendly you [ __ ]

2715.2 --> 2718.39
[Music]

2721.359 --> 2727.88
retards

2723.72 --> 2727.8799999999997
who what's going on

2728.119 --> 2731.28
oh Rhino you're still

2737.44 --> 2744.319
here who is benefiting from Green

2740.28 --> 2750.119
policies for it to be a scam El Gore the

2744.319 --> 2754.079
world economic Forum the industrial Mega

2750.119 --> 2756.559
Giants yeah who the [ __ ] you think is is

2754.079 --> 2758.96
getting Mone oh

2756.559 --> 2763.079
you really are a numpty [ __ ] aren't

2758.96 --> 2764.119
you are you like 15 or something no that

2763.079 --> 2767.319
can't

2764.119 --> 2769.0
be like 20 years ago I would have asked

2767.319 --> 2771.44
are you 15 because that would have been

2769.0 --> 2772.52
logical if you're 15 now no that doesn't

2771.44 --> 2776.28
work like

2772.52 --> 2779.839
that you're just a a traitor then you're

2776.28 --> 2779.8390000000004
a traitor trying to play

2784.64 --> 2790.96
dumb how does WF benefit from Green

2788.88 --> 2792.0
policies well it's very simple they get

2790.96 --> 2795.079
all the

2792.0 --> 2796.319
money everybody else gets nothing and

2795.079 --> 2801.319
gets to eat

2796.319 --> 2805.079
bugs and commit suicide for free yeah

2801.319 --> 2806.68
and then they inherit everything that's

2805.079 --> 2810.0
how they

2806.68 --> 2812.839
benefit yeah they close down [ __ ] over

2810.0 --> 2815.319
environmental nonsense and guess what

2812.839 --> 2817.52
happens then when it closes down well

2815.319 --> 2821.5589999999997
then they get to own it and then they

2817.52 --> 2824.359
reopen it and then they don't apply the

2821.559 --> 2827.28
environmental policies because they

2824.359 --> 2829.24
don't actually have to because it's all

2827.28 --> 2832.2400000000002
a

2829.24 --> 2832.24
scam

2832.4 --> 2839.76
yeah all this CO2 crap

2837.2 --> 2841.8799999999997
environmentalism it's not about making

2839.76 --> 2844.44
the environment better it's not about

2841.88 --> 2849.0
cleaning up pollution it's about them

2844.44 --> 2851.359
owning everything and you owning

2849.0 --> 2853.4
nothing that's what it's

2851.359 --> 2857.119
about

2853.4 --> 2860.52
yeah why don't the oil companies expose

2857.119 --> 2863.52
because the [ __ ] oil companies are

2860.52 --> 2868.92
the green lobby you

2863.52 --> 2870.8
idiot yeah they are it they started it

2868.92 --> 2875.079
it's [ __ ]

2870.8 --> 2876.28
oil that bribes [ __ ] weenie boys and

2875.079 --> 2878.96
girls

2876.28 --> 2882.52
to go on the street and lie on roads

2878.96 --> 2885.4
yeah it's [ __ ] big oil that organized

2882.52 --> 2885.4
the whole damn

2892.44 --> 2898.48
thing yeah they don't care they own it

2901.0 --> 2910.92
all they don't need to make money from

2906.52 --> 2914.64
their oil they just buy up the next

2910.92 --> 2916.319
industry and then destroy every single

2914.64 --> 2920.7599999999998
last

2916.319 --> 2923.2
competition all non Mega giant oils

2920.76 --> 2925.6400000000003
right destroy all of them because it's

2923.2 --> 2928.3999999999996
getting outdated oh the carbon taxes now

2925.64 --> 2932.7599999999998
oh no everybody's against it so they're

2928.4 --> 2933.48
the only ones left that even do anything

2932.76 --> 2937.1600000000003
with

2933.48 --> 2939.52
oil total and complete

2937.16 --> 2942.319
monopolization you don't understand

2939.52 --> 2945.24
anything about what's going on Rhino n w

2942.319 --> 2945.24
and V

2945.48 --> 2951.76
whatever you're Ling against your own

2948.079 --> 2954.7200000000003
interest yeah it's called

2951.76 --> 2958.5200000000004
monopolization they own it all so you

2954.72 --> 2962.3999999999996
eradicate the entire profession so you

2958.52 --> 2964.52
own it all then that's how that works

2962.4 --> 2967.28
it's called robber

2964.52 --> 2972.04
barons you should have paid some

2967.28 --> 2974.1600000000003
attention in History Class regarding the

2972.04 --> 2976.2
industrialization specifically of the

2974.16 --> 2977.44
United States where they learned this

2976.2 --> 2980.4399999999996
[ __ ] little

2977.44 --> 2980.44
trick

2981.73 --> 2985.19
[Music]

2993.64 --> 2998.0
yeah I'm a real fire cracker

3009.119 --> 3013.76
today why would they create a new

3011.72 --> 3017.52
industry so they Lobby against the old I

3013.76 --> 3021.6400000000003
already told you it's an older industry

3017.52 --> 3023.0
oil it it's very welldeveloped become

3021.64 --> 3027.0
super

3023.0 --> 3030.04
efficient and so to compete within that

3027.0 --> 3032.119
field is becoming easier and easier

3030.04 --> 3035.7599999999998
people are figuring out hey oil is

3032.119 --> 3042.839
actually renewing a not renewable a

3035.76 --> 3047.96
renewing resource oil wells fill back up

3042.839 --> 3052.24
oil wells fill back up oil wells fill

3047.96 --> 3055.68
back up yeah it's renewable it is

3052.24 --> 3057.319
specifically renewable quite unique oh

3055.68 --> 3060.2
we don't understand well that's your

3057.319 --> 3064.2799999999997
[ __ ] problem you don't understand it

3060.2 --> 3069.04
does oil is a renewable

3064.28 --> 3073.76
resource an abundant renewable resource

3069.04 --> 3077.44
and oil wells refill themselves over

3073.76 --> 3081.3590000000004
time proven in and in

3077.44 --> 3084.839
again since oil wells were dug they have

3081.359 --> 3090.0789999999997
been refilling this is known yeah

3084.839 --> 3093.7599999999998
because damage oh really so

3090.079 --> 3098.119
mining Rare Earth

3093.76 --> 3101.7200000000003
minerals for Gigantic amounts of car

3098.119 --> 3105.319
batteries CO2 neutral they aren't they

3101.72 --> 3109.48
actually waste more CO2

3105.319 --> 3111.92
yeah because of all the electric waste

3109.48 --> 3114.599
cuz the only way to actually be

3111.92 --> 3117.48
environmentally friendly is to have the

3114.599 --> 3118.44
reaction process on location where you

3117.48 --> 3120.68
need

3118.44 --> 3123.0
it because if you're going to have a

3120.68 --> 3125.7599999999998
central power generator and then it has

3123.0 --> 3128.839
to like travel all this distance you

3125.76 --> 3131.48
have an increasing amount of loss

3128.839 --> 3135.0
percentile wise the more distance it has

3131.48 --> 3140.599
to travel yeah super inefficient yeah

3135.0 --> 3140.599
electric cars it's exactly what that is

3144.28 --> 3147.28
yeah

3148.079 --> 3155.0
yeah oil does not cause a lot of damage

3152.04 --> 3156.64
it doesn't anymore anyway yeah rare

3155.0 --> 3160.839
Earth mineral

3156.64 --> 3164.64
digging now that causes freaking

3160.839 --> 3169.04
damage you know how dirty that

3164.64 --> 3172.7599999999998
gets ever seen the Cobalt mines in

3169.04 --> 3172.7599999999998
Africa holy [ __ ]

3173.76 --> 3182.3590000000004
dude it's early technology yeah oh so

3177.92 --> 3188.64
important oh yeah so while we have that

3182.359 --> 3192.2799999999997
early technology yeah how about we stick

3188.64 --> 3195.0
in general times of Crisis energy CR why

3192.28 --> 3198.96
don't we stick to the things

3195.0 --> 3200.599
that actually work and have been

3198.96 --> 3206.2
thoroughly

3200.599 --> 3209.3590000000004
developed and are readily accessible and

3206.2 --> 3212.2799999999997
all the resources to attain it are

3209.359 --> 3215.04
already there and in place maybe we

3212.28 --> 3219.52
should use

3215.04 --> 3222.04
that instead of oh well just the the new

3219.52 --> 3224.28
thing we just need to develop it's in an

3222.04 --> 3225.599
early stage yeah it's in an early stage

3224.28 --> 3228.48
and it

3225.599 --> 3232.3590000000004
sucks it's in an early stage and it

3228.48 --> 3236.48
sucks it's devastating to the

3232.359 --> 3239.04
environment it's a gigantic waste of

3236.48 --> 3241.2400000000002
energy in

3239.04 --> 3246.44
general

3241.24 --> 3248.9599999999996
so how many centuries do you need to

3246.44 --> 3250.2400000000002
develop under that crap the which you

3248.96 --> 3252.44
don't have because you're going to run

3250.24 --> 3254.64
out of all the necessary resources very

3252.44 --> 3257.04
quickly before you even get to develop

3254.64 --> 3260.799
to that level how many centes do you

3257.04 --> 3266.2
need to develop before it actually

3260.799 --> 3268.359
becomes as efficient as our use of oil

3266.2 --> 3271.5589999999997
will which we've

3268.359 --> 3276.359
had two centuries of development at

3271.559 --> 3278.799
least ah huh oh nobody's here no

3276.359 --> 3281.5589999999997
environmentalist ever thinks about these

3278.799 --> 3285.64
things because they're [ __ ]

3281.559 --> 3289.28
[ __ ] cuz they take too many

3285.64 --> 3291.44
vaccines cuz they believe in magical

3289.28 --> 3295.48
thinking and that they could just

3291.44 --> 3298.28
like s get brain damage and and then

3295.48 --> 3301.68
become smarter or something I don't know

3298.28 --> 3305.8390000000004
what the [ __ ] is wrong with these

3301.68 --> 3309.2799999999997
people yeah it doesn't work it can't

3305.839 --> 3312.7599999999998
work electric cars

3309.28 --> 3317.48
universally like to standardize that

3312.76 --> 3320.5200000000004
can't work there's not enough resources

3317.48 --> 3324.72
and by the time it gets developed and

3320.52 --> 3327.4
made more efficient to theoretically

3324.72 --> 3330.9599999999996
become come a little bit more durable

3327.4 --> 3334.48
yeah you've already spent like three

3330.96 --> 3338.68
times the amount of resources there even

3334.48 --> 3342.68
are available for it yeah it can't work

3338.68 --> 3345.8799999999997
it was never able to work it's

3342.68 --> 3348.68
[ __ ] all it's doing now is wasting

3345.88 --> 3351.52
all of these resources for no damn

3348.68 --> 3355.7599999999998
reason because you don't need them

3351.52 --> 3357.16
because you don't need to replace oil

3355.76 --> 3361.2000000000003
this is

3357.16 --> 3364.44
all purposeful

3361.2 --> 3368.319
self-destruction demonic

3364.44 --> 3370.599
Marxism that's what's behind it it's not

3368.319 --> 3374.44
environmentalism it's demonic and it

3370.599 --> 3376.839
leads to like total Destruction like

3374.44 --> 3379.799
long-term

it but yeah was a heavily Rowdy

5624.36 --> 5633.5599999999995
show got some stupid environmentalist

5628.28 --> 5633.5599999999995

5636.56 --> 5638.96
lots of

5639.119 --> 5646.5199999999995
swearing and then later just bunch of

5642.44 --> 5648.32
wrench Hassle and Moxy or yeah turns out

5671.199 --> 5677.759999999999

5673.239 --> 5679.959999999999
away I'm going to re administer them

5677.76 --> 5681.8
carefully and a whole bunch of people

5679.96 --> 5684.159
aren't going to get their wrenches back

5681.8 --> 5686.96
because I literally have no logical

5684.159 --> 5690.719
reason to trust

5686.96 --> 5692.36
you although it's not like I'm angry I

5690.719 --> 5694.92
don't want to have you around it's just

5692.36 --> 5696.719
that there I have no logical reason to

5694.92 --> 5698.639
trust you and I'm not even going to tell

5696.719 --> 5699.83
you you're just not going to get the

5698.639 --> 5705.32
wrench back that is

5699.83 --> 5708.28
[Music]

5705.32 --> 5710.5199999999995
all there plenty of people in the in the

5708.28 --> 5712.639
chat regularly that don't have wrenches

5710.52 --> 5715.56
anyway right and it they shouldn't need

5712.639 --> 5717.84
to because hey if I don't have any more

5715.56 --> 5722.280000000001
infiltrant well nobody's going to get

5717.84 --> 5723.679
blocked for not having a wrench so

5722.28 --> 5726.08
and that's just

5723.679 --> 5729.8
it that's how it's going to work so the

5726.08 --> 5732.04
the problem is solved now if everything

5729.8 --> 5734.8
goes by plan I mean Johnny can still

5732.04 --> 5737.96
unblock himself but I think that I don't

5734.8 --> 5742.639
think that's because

5737.96 --> 5742.639
of a moderator account doing

5748.08 --> 5753.4
that hey blue pill

5750.4 --> 5753.4
devolution

5755.76 --> 5762.8
no sound but not buffering okay that's

5758.88 --> 5766.1990000000005
weird right well you definitely get a

5762.8 --> 5768.28
wrench since I get regular support from

5766.199 --> 5770.599999999999
you that's a certain way to get a

5768.28 --> 5772.5199999999995
wrench I mean if you're going to pay me

5770.6 --> 5775.08
money you would be pretty weird to pay

5772.52 --> 5779.88
me money so you could [ __ ] around with

5775.08 --> 5779.88
my show so that would just be

5780.32 --> 5784.36
crazy

5782.28 --> 5786.719
right and I appreciate that support a

5784.36 --> 5789.4

today not that I know of clutch I mean

6050.0 --> 6055.119
guns are complet completely

6052.119 --> 6057.88
illegal

6055.119 --> 6060.04
here in general if somebody actually

6057.88 --> 6062.4400000000005
spots a gun they really like call the

6060.04 --> 6062.44
police

6063.56 --> 6068.1990000000005
immediately there I mean there's

6066.119 --> 6071.679
probably some gun

6068.199 --> 6074.799999999999
crime in like bad neighborhoods or

6071.679 --> 6077.639
whatever but not around here not not

6074.8 --> 6077.639
around these

6079.84 --> 6082.84
parts

6085.119 --> 6091.199
shooting in o yeah I mean they're still

6088.36 --> 6091.199
criminals in the

6092.32 --> 6097.92
Netherlands it's not

6094.719 --> 6099.679
completely free right I mean yeah when

6097.92 --> 6101.2390000000005
guns are illegal yeah guess what there's

6099.679 --> 6104.119
criminals they they're going to have

6101.239 --> 6104.119
guns

6104.159 --> 6111.5199999999995
yeah but I mean it's pretty

6107.8 --> 6114.400000000001
rare in contrast everybody always seems

6111.52 --> 6116.96
to think it's it's just like oh just

6114.4 --> 6119.159
shoot fireworks every freaking day of

6116.96 --> 6119.159
the

6119.24 --> 6125.36
[Music]

6120.56 --> 6125.360000000001
year do I think guns should be

6126.08 --> 6133.88
legal yeah in general yes universally

6139.76 --> 6142.88
yes

6141.92 --> 6146.84
I

6142.88 --> 6146.84
do but I mean

6149.159 --> 6155.5199999999995
yeah there's going to be issues and like

6152.239 --> 6155.5199999999995
it's not going to work

6156.04 --> 6161.76
culturally

6158.8 --> 6165.159000000001
here but I mean like if things get

6161.76 --> 6168.280000000001
serious and there's like Civil War type

6165.159 --> 6169.839999999999
situations which like there's a chance

6168.28 --> 6173.04
that that is going to arrive with all

6169.84 --> 6176.679
this crazy migration [ __ ] happening

6173.04 --> 6181.76
everywhere then eventually yeah I would

6176.679 --> 6181.76
love there to be a reintroduction of

6182.28 --> 6187.36
like arms

6184.599 --> 6191.88
carrying but I

6187.36 --> 6194.799999999999
mean like with it's all filled out like

6191.88 --> 6198.4800000000005
it's like too many [ __ ] and SJ double

6194.8 --> 6202.679
you [ __ ] and like it it doesn't

6198.48 --> 6202.678999999999
work not here not any

6204.76 --> 6211.400000000001
more right but I mean if a lot of them

6208.239 --> 6214.28
get killed like a total like

6211.4 --> 6218.159
Annihilation like somebody would like

6214.28 --> 6221.84
Israel them or something yeah then

6218.159 --> 6223.92
eventually gun carrying might come back

6221.84 --> 6225.400000000001
because all the [ __ ] retards and

6223.92 --> 6228.33
wussies are

6225.4 --> 6229.679
dead

6229.679 --> 6234.1900000000005

[Music]

6236.48 --> 6239.69
[Music]

6240.119 --> 6244.239
it's not a gun problem it's a moral

6241.96 --> 6244.2390000000005
that's

6259.599 --> 6262.599
right

6266.96 --> 6269.599
right but I

6270.0 --> 6279.119
mean if

6272.679 --> 6284.1990000000005
police were more efficient and better

6279.119 --> 6287.5199999999995
prepared then you don't necessarily even

6284.199 --> 6291.32
need all the all the guns in everybody's

6287.52 --> 6294.56
hands right if police just do their

6291.32 --> 6298.679
[ __ ] work and actually do their work

6294.56 --> 6302.320000000001
and not like go around applying to like

6298.679 --> 6305.4400000000005
applying stupid policies and like oh

6302.32 --> 6309.119
join gay parades and that kind of crap

6305.44 --> 6310.879999999999
they just not do that ever at all and

6309.119 --> 6311.96
they got more serious and they just got

6310.88 --> 6316.04
a little

6311.96 --> 6319.08
tougher on crime and not a ning and not

6316.04 --> 6322.28
a stupid traffic rule hor [ __ ] what

6319.08 --> 6326.159
actual crime got just offer with

6322.28 --> 6326.159
that that helps a

6327.639 --> 6333.400000000001
lot

6329.719 --> 6335.76
right I mean just could you imagine like

6333.4 --> 6338.08
a city like San Francisco or something

6335.76 --> 6340.159000000001
it's completely the [ __ ] totally

6338.08 --> 6342.84
demoralized completely corrupted in

6340.159 --> 6345.04
every conceivable way like can you

6342.84 --> 6347.4400000000005
imagine just reintroducing the Second

6345.04 --> 6352.04
Amendment like

6347.44 --> 6356.04
dude like so many people would probably

6352.04 --> 6359.76
die the first week from

6356.04 --> 6363.32
that because they're all completely

6359.76 --> 6366.08
insane and deranged and demonic and like

6363.32 --> 6370.199
yeah you don't want a bunch of demonic

6366.08 --> 6374.04
people getting guns easily because

6370.199 --> 6374.04
they're going to do demonic [ __ ] with

6378.28 --> 6384.88
that but hey if you City is like really

6382.08 --> 6386.88
clean up and like everybody knows their

6384.88 --> 6389.599
neighbors and helps each other

6386.88 --> 6393.08
continually and

6389.599 --> 6396.360000000001
like like there's like groups like

6393.08 --> 6398.48
neighborhood brawl groups almost like

6396.36 --> 6400.759999999999
the the tough guys from the neighborhood

6398.48 --> 6403.718999999999
that'll just like defend the

6400.76 --> 6405.52
neighborhood like if it gets to that

6403.719 --> 6407.32
point

6405.52 --> 6409.56
then like

6407.32 --> 6411.239
reintroducing the Second Amendment like

6409.56 --> 6413.4400000000005
it arms

6411.239 --> 6416.119
is very doable because there's good

6413.44 --> 6419.48
morality and people are

6416.119 --> 6423.598999999999
living like doing right

6419.48 --> 6425.28
things taking care of things properly

6423.599 --> 6428.719
being defensive of their neighborhood

6425.28 --> 6428.719
and then works much

6430.76 --> 6434.76
better because the morale is good but if

6433.199 --> 6436.199
the morale is [ __ ] and everybody's

6434.76 --> 6439.320000000001
demonic yeah they're just going to do

6436.199 --> 6442.32
demonic [ __ ] with the guns

6439.32 --> 6442.32
then

6445.0 --> 6448.8
very disappointed with the US police

6447.52 --> 6451.8
force

6448.8 --> 6451.8
tyrants

6453.08 --> 6457.48
it's are they tyrants or are they just

6455.96 --> 6461.4800000000005
completely

6457.48 --> 6464.48
[ __ ] I mean the police in the US is

6461.48 --> 6467.119
just it's insane and one hand they get

6464.48 --> 6471.159
like extreme reaction policies and on

6467.119 --> 6474.36
the other they just like

6471.159 --> 6478.28
like through their through justice

6474.36 --> 6481.5599999999995
system people that are just monstrous

6478.28 --> 6483.96
murderers like ideological [ __ ]

6481.56 --> 6485.1990000000005
insane murderers just like oh it just L

6483.96 --> 6489.76
them back on the

6485.199 --> 6491.879999999999
street like after like cop killers could

6489.76 --> 6493.400000000001
just would at some point just be let

6491.88 --> 6494.92
back on the street it's going to get

6493.4 --> 6499.239
that

6494.92 --> 6503.52
bad that's not the police Force's fault

6499.239 --> 6506.678999999999
okay that's the police Chiefs and

6503.52 --> 6509.1990000000005
whoever is doing that the mayor arguably

6506.679 --> 6512.159
or whatever whatever the control system

6509.199 --> 6514.96
is it's keeping that in place that is

6512.159 --> 6517.199
the problem but why would they do that

6514.96 --> 6520.119
well probably because if

6517.199 --> 6521.678999999999
they in their judgment if they didn't do

6520.119 --> 6524.799999999999
it they'd

6521.679 --> 6527.84
probably feel responsible for like a

6524.8 --> 6532.320000000001
civil war but I

6527.84 --> 6533.32
mean shouldn't it right it's completely

6532.32 --> 6536.96
out of

6533.32 --> 6539.119
control bunch of ravaging demonic people

6536.96 --> 6542.639
that don't even speak the language half

6539.119 --> 6544.96
of the time just like randomly

6542.639 --> 6548.1990000000005
assassinating vulnerable people in the

6544.96 --> 6550.159
streets yeah when that happens a civil

6548.199 --> 6554.44
war should break

6550.159 --> 6557.638999999999
out and you should exterminate those

6554.44 --> 6561.44
people and keep Exterminating those

6557.639 --> 6564.52
people that do that yeah

6561.44 --> 6569.119
that's what logically should

6564.52 --> 6570.92
happen yeah get racist genocidal random

6569.119 --> 6573.719
assassins in the street yeah those

6570.92 --> 6577.0
people that do that they should be

6573.719 --> 6580.52
exterminated with machine

6577.0 --> 6583.36
guns and SWAT

6580.52 --> 6586.360000000001
teams yeah that don't capture them they

6583.36 --> 6589.28
kill them and it should be like

6586.36 --> 6590.679
that yeah and that's what these [ __ ]

6589.28 --> 6593.5199999999995
liberal [ __ ]

6590.679 --> 6596.36
wits at the top in those giant cities

6593.52 --> 6599.92
are also very very afraid of because

6596.36 --> 6604.598999999999
they should [ __ ] kill

6599.92 --> 6607.4400000000005
themselves get out of the way and die

6604.599 --> 6611.88

[Music]

6774.76 --> 6780.4400000000005
ah it's good to be Arwin on the early

6776.92 --> 6782.84
bir show calling

6780.44 --> 6785.678999999999
for

6782.84 --> 6788.56
extermination it's great to be me and

6785.679 --> 6792.1990000000005
just say it exactly how it

6788.56 --> 6795.52
is exactly how I see it and I know it's

6792.199 --> 6798.759999999999
all too far and I'm done I'm [ __ ]

6795.52 --> 6801.320000000001
done it's too far yeah well guess what

6798.76 --> 6805.04
those that are systematically

6801.32 --> 6808.639
Exterminating every person in the world

6805.04 --> 6811.92
they're doing exactly that so you can

6808.639 --> 6816.36
either sit by and just be

6811.92 --> 6821.0
exterminated or you could get to work

6816.36 --> 6824.598999999999
and actually push back on the same

6821.0 --> 6827.48
level start to uh erase some of the

6824.599 --> 6827.4800000000005
damage they've

6828.76 --> 6831.76
caused

6842.26 --> 6845.499
[Music]

6855.239 --> 6860.28
cops should take regular psych

6857.159 --> 6864.079
personality test maybe there should also

6860.28 --> 6864.079
be a better way to identify

6864.599 --> 6870.0
people right it should be and not

6867.92 --> 6873.4400000000005
talking about digital ID blah blah I

6870.0 --> 6875.76
should I mean there is General

6873.44 --> 6879.199
identity

6875.76 --> 6882.56
systems if a cop could pull somebody

6879.199 --> 6886.5199999999995
over it would be great if they already

6882.56 --> 6888.159000000001
knew who they'd be expecting to be in

6886.52 --> 6890.52
the

6888.159 --> 6893.0
car like that they could take the plate

6890.52 --> 6894.360000000001
and then immediately notice who owns

6893.0 --> 6897.8
that

6894.36 --> 6901.36
car and that they could see if it's

6897.8 --> 6904.320000000001
him that sort of

6901.36 --> 6907.839999999999
thing right because if you have all that

6904.32 --> 6909.44
in the know you have less reason to [ __ ]

6907.84 --> 6911.0
your pants because you ate too much

6909.44 --> 6912.879999999999
donuts and you don't know there could be

6911.0 --> 6915.84
somebody just step out of the car and

6912.88 --> 6919.28
immediately shoot you but if you know

6915.84 --> 6922.56
more about like who exactly to expect

6919.28 --> 6925.96
you don't have to [ __ ] your pants that

6922.56 --> 6928.119000000001
much as a

6925.96 --> 6930.76
cop

6928.119 --> 6933.5599999999995
right because it's getting freaking

6930.76 --> 6936.8
scary man out there in the United States

6933.56 --> 6943.320000000001
as a cop with all these disgusting black

6936.8 --> 6947.599
life matter racist cop murderers okay no

6943.32 --> 6950.159
wonder no wonder they go all

6947.599 --> 6953.56
crazy there's like cop

6950.159 --> 6953.5599999999995
assassins there

6958.52 --> 6963.2390000000005
dude your fourth amendment who gives a

6967.679 --> 6973.4
[ __ ] yeah you want your Fourth Amendment

6970.679 --> 6975.84
right not violated well then get ready

6973.4 --> 6977.5599999999995
for jittery cops that could be

6975.84 --> 6979.0
accidentally pulling the trigger

6977.56 --> 6981.4400000000005
shooting you dead because they're

6979.0 --> 6983.079
[ __ ] out their minds because there's

6981.44 --> 6986.239
regular

6983.079 --> 6989.199
indoctrinated anti-cop assassins going

6986.239 --> 6992.5199999999995
around randomly for no damn reason just

6989.199 --> 6996.5199999999995
out of nowhere shooting cops yeah it's

6992.52 --> 6996.52
up to you Jason whatever you

6998.27 --> 7001.469
[Music]

7004.0 --> 7010.079
want it's not about taking rights away

7007.599 --> 7013.28
it's about being

7010.079 --> 7016.0
prepared yeah a car is

7013.28 --> 7018.719
registered that information all of that

7016.0 --> 7022.52
should be readily available I mean it is

7018.719 --> 7024.4
already available it should be just you

7022.52 --> 7027.76
know it you know who's going to be in

7024.4 --> 7027.759999999999
that car

7038.4 --> 7041.4
Bang

7051.36 --> 7055.5199999999995
we do need them is a balance

7056.159 --> 7059.5599999999995
what what are you

7059.719 --> 7064.719
talking focus on why people are acting

7062.48 --> 7066.36
that way because they can they're acting

7064.719 --> 7070.28
that way because they can they get

7066.36 --> 7073.4
carried away they get pulled into cults

7070.28 --> 7075.159
Cults that literally program to kill

7073.4 --> 7077.04
themselves and they still do it because

7075.159 --> 7078.96
they're [ __ ] [ __ ] and nobody

7077.04 --> 7083.36
tells them anything

7078.96 --> 7083.36
different nobody tells them not to do

7083.48 --> 7088.4
it

7085.48 --> 7093.959999999999
yeah you can't fix

7088.4 --> 7093.96
it you got to make people fix

7094.92 --> 7100.4400000000005
themselves yeah police is essential you

7098.32 --> 7103.96
can't just take all the police away and

7100.44 --> 7106.678999999999
then expect the deranged people from

7103.96 --> 7110.079
becoming less deranged yeah it doesn't

7106.679 --> 7114.679
work it does not

7110.079 --> 7118.599
work you have to force it you must force

7114.679 --> 7122.0
it people that are dilapidated and

7118.599 --> 7126.32
deranged are not going to improve

7122.0 --> 7126.32
themselves if you take away

7128.32 --> 7133.199
Force

7131.04 --> 7135.599
I mean if that would work then why do we

7133.199 --> 7137.96
have prison

7135.599 --> 7141.079
systems I mean you might not just as

7137.96 --> 7142.88
well just cancel all prison systems just

7141.079 --> 7145.199
like oh no you just get to live in a

7142.88 --> 7148.1990000000005
house

7145.199 --> 7148.199
then

7149.599 --> 7155.96
right no you need

7152.32 --> 7158.88
force and for Force you need police and

7155.96 --> 7160.96
for police you need safeguards for

7158.88 --> 7162.159000000001
police

7160.96 --> 7165.119
so they

7162.159 --> 7167.44
don't have to live like it's a

7165.119 --> 7169.5599999999995
NeverEnding war zone where they could

7167.44 --> 7171.919999999999
literally just out of nowhere get

7169.56 --> 7174.96
assassinated and they can't even take

7171.92 --> 7178.56
measures to try to prevent it okay I'm

7174.96 --> 7180.84
sorry [ __ ] you if you think that's cool

7178.56 --> 7180.84

7186.639 --> 7191.76
police in general if there's a sit

7189.239 --> 7193.5599999999995
situation if even if it went all wrong

7191.76 --> 7197.280000000001

police officer in these times especially

90% are corrupt yeah well if there's

7224.36 --> 7227.239
corruption there's corruption then

7225.8 --> 7229.0

7227.239 --> 7231.638999999999
corruption get the police chief right

7229.0 --> 7234.52
it's all about the police chief it's all

7231.639 --> 7237.28

7234.52 --> 7240.679
time why do you think that I always say

7237.28 --> 7242.92
that have the cities all the [ __ ] the

7240.679 --> 7247.159
cops are not the problem they're

7242.92 --> 7250.4800000000005
freaking Heroes they're all post-

7247.159 --> 7252.4
traumatically like full of that [ __ ]

7250.48 --> 7254.159
right because it's so tough and they are

7252.4 --> 7257.48
not allowed to do anything it's the

7254.159 --> 7259.4
[ __ ] police chief every freaking time

7257.48 --> 7262.32
get

7259.4 --> 7265.679
him make them

7262.32 --> 7268.759999999999
change make them change the policy it's

7265.679 --> 7272.1990000000005
like no [ __ ] your Li liberal [ __ ]

7268.76 --> 7275.76
[ __ ] weenie [ __ ] and get

7272.199 --> 7275.759999999999
forceful make it

7277.04 --> 7281.04
happen get it under

7295.48 --> 7301.159
control but should not take away

7297.96 --> 7303.4
people's rights no of course why should

7301.159 --> 7306.159
they what like what does that even have

7303.4 --> 7309.598999999999
to do with anything like what rights are

7306.159 --> 7311.44
even being taken away by these cops and

7309.599 --> 7314.400000000001
who gives a

7311.44 --> 7317.96
[ __ ] now that's not true you give a [ __ ]

7314.4 --> 7320.04
I get it but it's like that's usually

7317.96 --> 7322.36
all that right [ __ ] is just a bunch of

7320.04 --> 7326.56
traffic nonsense

7322.36 --> 7328.199
anyway yeah cuz anything other than that

7326.56 --> 7330.1990000000005
like the cops are not going to like

7328.199 --> 7333.799999999999
break in a house without a warrant or

7330.199 --> 7337.36
anything okay they don't do

7333.8 --> 7340.1990000000005
that so I don't get it I don't see the

7337.36 --> 7342.88
problem it's just like oh traffic issues

7340.199 --> 7346.199
or maybe Free Speech issues right I get

7342.88 --> 7350.159000000001
it like oh the cops are just like no you

7346.199 --> 7353.0
can't do that in AO Riot cops can it's

7350.159 --> 7355.839999999999
it's complicated though traffic

7353.0 --> 7358.32
situations yeah it's

7355.84 --> 7360.639
annoying but that's not the really

7358.32 --> 7363.92
important issues

7360.639 --> 7366.639
really crime is the really important

7363.92 --> 7370.4400000000005
issues the real

7366.639 --> 7372.84
crimes the real robber Ries and all that

7370.44 --> 7373.96
crap and assassinations and like

7372.84 --> 7377.96
gangster

7373.96 --> 7377.96
[ __ ] that's the real

7396.239 --> 7400.879999999999
problem

7397.88 --> 7400.88
right

7407.52 --> 7412.56
all right glad you agree with me Clutch

7409.199 --> 7415.48
it's just I'm so sick of people [ __ ]

7412.56 --> 7419.119000000001
on cops but I mean yeah if they act

7415.48 --> 7419.119
corrupted that's [ __ ]

7420.599 --> 7428.0
annoying it's weak of them

7424.679 --> 7430.119
right but I mean if there's cops in

7428.0 --> 7432.4
there that don't they're really in it

7430.119 --> 7434.639
for the power and for the money or

7432.4 --> 7437.638999999999
whatever and they don't even want to

7434.639 --> 7440.32
take real serious action which causes

7437.639 --> 7441.92
risk right for them they're like that

7440.32 --> 7444.759999999999
yeah then just get the [ __ ] out of it

7441.92 --> 7450.1990000000005
that's just a it's a

7444.76 --> 7453.159000000001
tick it's a fake cup get the [ __ ]

7450.199 --> 7455.28
out but I

7453.159 --> 7458.159
mean other than

7455.28 --> 7460.8
that it's really important to have good

7458.159 --> 7460.799999999999
cops

7461.079 --> 7465.679
cuz if you don't have good cops then

7463.679 --> 7468.559
criminals out there will start to take

7465.679 --> 7472.36
notice like hey they don't actually have

7468.559 --> 7474.88
any real cops out here so we can just do

7472.36 --> 7477.759999999999
this then we can just do these crimes

7474.88 --> 7479.84
then yeah that's what

7477.76 --> 7482.84
happens that's what happens when you

7479.84 --> 7482.84
bully cops

7483.679 --> 7491.679
away yeah criminals take over and they

7487.32 --> 7491.679
don't care they don't care about

7492.119 --> 7497.639
anything they don't especially don't

7494.639 --> 7500.0
care about your [ __ ] rights you

7497.639 --> 7503.36
see that's the point about criminals

7500.0 --> 7506.92
they really don't care about your

7503.36 --> 7506.92
rights that's why they're

7517.679 --> 7523.36
criminals everywhere you go is good and

7520.239 --> 7523.36
bad people that's

7523.68 --> 7526.89
[Music]

7533.88 --> 7539.36
right now

7536.52 --> 7541.400000000001
ideally the good people the good cops

7539.36 --> 7544.28
should be dealing with good

7541.4 --> 7547.5199999999995
people and the bad cops should be

7544.28 --> 7549.599
dealing with bad people right I mean if

7547.52 --> 7551.400000000001
you're in there as a cop because you're

7549.599 --> 7554.04
kind of a bastard that's kind of a

7551.4 --> 7556.199
sadist and you're like yeah I like to

7554.04 --> 7557.559
see people hurt you know especially when

7556.199 --> 7560.96
they're pieces of

7557.559 --> 7563.84
[ __ ] yeah kind of a bad cop but hey

7560.96 --> 7567.0
there are plenty of pieces of [ __ ] and

7563.84 --> 7568.679
they need taking down Etc dude that's

7567.0 --> 7573.0
what they're there

7568.679 --> 7575.28
for right cop that doesn't give a [ __ ]

7573.0 --> 7580.599
doesn't care if you're hurt or something

7575.28 --> 7580.599
and go after real nasty pieces of work

7580.639 --> 7588.88
right everything has a

7584.559 --> 7592.639
purpose it's just if you send bad cops

7588.88 --> 7595.8
after good people terrible things happen

7592.639 --> 7599.559
if you send good cops after terrible

7595.8 --> 7601.719
people it might work out or the good

7599.559 --> 7603.92
cops go to

7601.719 --> 7606.0
hell cuz they're definitely going to get

7603.92 --> 7608.92
traumatized from that [ __ ] while a bad

7606.0 --> 7611.239
cop doesn't give a [ __ ] usually so there

7608.92 --> 7615.84
They Don't Really eventually it's going

7611.239 --> 7615.839999999999
to mess with them but right see what I

7616.28 --> 7622.4
mean but yeah we always get to see in

7619.199 --> 7624.96
the media they always show us these bad

7622.4 --> 7626.719
cop good people type situations and then

7624.96 --> 7628.4
you're like hey hey what the [ __ ] man

7626.719 --> 7631.159
what are you doing hey you didn't do

7628.4 --> 7632.839999999999
anything that [ __ ] right and that's just

7631.159 --> 7636.159
terrible that's

7632.84 --> 7639.0
a bad cop good person situation that's

7636.159 --> 7642.0
what you don't want but if that guy is a

7639.0 --> 7645.159
freaking piece of [ __ ] that just pistol

7642.0 --> 7646.8
whipped somebody or something right yeah

7645.159 --> 7649.04
you you wouldn't

7646.8 --> 7651.88
mind getting a little bit of rough

7649.04 --> 7655.719
treatment then cuz he's actually a

7651.88 --> 7655.719
scumbag right let's be

7659.0 --> 7667.079
honest right you don't want the good

7663.4 --> 7669.598999999999
cup they're like oh yeah that guy just

7667.079 --> 7672.04
murdered somebody because he's like

7669.599 --> 7674.400000000001
drunk or something and an idiot to then

7672.04 --> 7676.28
like oh make sure he doesn't get hurt

7674.4 --> 7680.5199999999995
make sure we don't violate his right

7676.28 --> 7682.559
[ __ ] you dude idiot cop you're in a

7680.52 --> 7684.88
wrong place you need to deal with with

7682.559 --> 7686.84
regular

7684.88 --> 7688.76
citizens that's where it's really

7686.84 --> 7690.88
important like people that are actually

7688.76 --> 7693.2390000000005
trying to be good

7690.88 --> 7695.119
citizens yeah they should have their

7693.239 --> 7697.718999999999
rights respected but if it's just some

7695.119 --> 7699.92
[ __ ] scumbag crazy person that's

7697.719 --> 7703.159
barely even human anymore because of

7699.92 --> 7705.28
what they do to themselves you don't

7703.159 --> 7708.28
[ __ ] their

7705.28 --> 7708.28
rights

7709.36 --> 7717.0
yeah you don't want the good cops on bad

7714.079 --> 7718.88
people you want the bad cops on the bad

7717.0 --> 7720.88
people and you want the good cops on the

7718.88 --> 7723.079
good people that's what we want to see

7720.88 --> 7724.88
that's the videos we want to see that's

7723.079 --> 7727.159
how it should be

7724.88 --> 7728.88
happening if you continually turn it

7727.159 --> 7730.5199999999995
around yeah that's going to just be

7728.88 --> 7732.4400000000005
terrible for cops they're either going

7730.52 --> 7734.280000000001
to look like complete [ __ ] wussies

7732.44 --> 7736.44
that aren't fixing their problem or

7734.28 --> 7739.84
they're going to look like a bunch of

7736.44 --> 7743.96
bullies that are actually trying to just

7739.84 --> 7748.2390000000005
ruin regular citizens lives all bad that

7743.96 --> 7748.2390000000005
way so don't have it that

7748.44 --> 7756.0
way there's something shitty going on

7752.679 --> 7760.32
send a bad cop somebody who's a bit

7756.0 --> 7760.32
sadistic who doesn't give a [ __ ] yeah

7778.32 --> 7783.32
going to be into that

7780.28 --> 7785.5199999999995
probably so it will just work better

7783.32 --> 7785.5199999999995
that

7787.32 --> 7790.32
way

7793.8 --> 7800.159000000001

overlooked detail about the the US

7825.639 --> 7832.0
system the sheriffs are very

7829.04 --> 7833.88
important more important than most of

me

7868.96 --> 7873.84

7872.32 --> 7876.599

7873.84 --> 7880.159000000001
with that person I [ __ ] hate people

7876.599 --> 7880.159000000001

annoyed with cops or a cop might be a

7885.84 --> 7891.0
