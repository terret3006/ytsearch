oh

579.6 --> 586.8000000000001
so i feel a little bouncy right now

583.04 --> 586.8

588.48 --> 591.9200000000001
awesome well i don't know if that's

590.08 --> 595.48
awesome

591.92 --> 595.4799999999999
not sure yet

630.64 --> 634.56
right yeah she came to check out the

632.56 --> 637.279
room i think she's probably gonna take

634.56 --> 639.68
it she said she really liked it and it

637.279 --> 643.68
was after having seen me so apparently

639.68 --> 645.279
i'm not some kind of energy objection

643.68 --> 649.959
it's just that she

645.279 --> 649.959
she reminded me a little of my ex

665.69 --> 669.2790000000001
[Music]

667.68 --> 672.279
well that's a problem with a crush

669.279 --> 672.279
infection

674.24 --> 678.24
jesus christ man i haven't been

678.64 --> 685.959
electrically slapped like that in

682.399 --> 685.959
almost a decade

688.88 --> 693.519
i mean there's plenty of cute girls i

691.36 --> 696.519
see out there but there's something

693.519 --> 696.519
happened

702.16 --> 707.48
oh x is that a good thing yes and now

717.92 --> 722.959
i'm just trying to figure out what this

720.639 --> 722.9590000000001
means

726.0 --> 730.24
i think it might be

728.32 --> 732.48
something i actually wished for and that

730.24 --> 734.0790000000001
is an opportunity to kind of set write

732.48 --> 736.16
what i did wrong

734.079 --> 738.0
with my ex and that does not

736.16 --> 742.04
automatically mean i'm gonna have a

738.0 --> 742.04
relationship with this girl

745.76 --> 748.079
huh

748.959 --> 751.4399999999999
i'm just like

750.32 --> 753.9200000000001

ah

794.24 --> 799.12
pj krishan feels good

796.639 --> 801.839
well it's overwhelming

799.12 --> 801.839
right

805.2 --> 809.9200000000001
it's like there's a hundred

806.72 --> 812.399
conversations compacted basically having

809.92 --> 814.4799999999999
revealed themselves in

812.399 --> 817.48
such a way that i can't handle it just

814.48 --> 817.48
yet

831.76 --> 836.8389999999999
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

847.83 --> 850.889
[Music]

853.6 --> 858.5600000000001
oh jesus christ man this is insane

859.44 --> 862.5600000000001
the [ __ ] down dude

866.959 --> 870.92
hello return to normal

882.8 --> 888.7199999999999
it almost feels like i should be like

885.04 --> 888.7199999999999
sprinting a mile or something

888.88 --> 893.36
but yeah that's going to be a little

890.24 --> 895.44
tough around here and right now

893.36 --> 897.6800000000001
because yeah she basically

895.44 --> 899.6
went right away

897.68 --> 902.4799999999999
like at

899.6 --> 902.48
at one o'clock

904.88 --> 911.16
that's also part of the reason i

906.72 --> 911.1600000000001
basically started a little late

913.12 --> 917.839
it's a like unpackaged decompact

918.959 --> 923.3599999999999
yeah you do dude just

921.12 --> 925.6
chill

923.36 --> 927.92
i i don't know if it's good news it

925.6 --> 930.24
might also be tragic loose

927.92 --> 933.519
right

930.24 --> 937.44
temperature 70 degrees right now but

933.519 --> 937.44
that's not why i'm being a little shaky

937.6 --> 941.12
it's not freezing ourselves and it's

939.519 --> 942.5600000000001
just that

941.12 --> 945.36
it's a lot of

942.56 --> 948.16
spiritual data just hit me like an

945.36 --> 948.16
electric whip

949.36 --> 956.639
he had a great composure

952.24 --> 956.639
it's just there's so many questions

958.24 --> 960.48
like

961.759 --> 965.36
she's literally in medical school that

964.0 --> 966.56
means

965.36 --> 969.6800000000001
high risk

966.56 --> 972.079
for facts indoctrination and i'm kind of

969.68 --> 975.959
scared

972.079 --> 975.959
she's really nice

983.68 --> 989.8389999999999
we know why i'm shaking oh tell me

986.079 --> 989.8389999999999
pediatrician you tell me

990.0 --> 996.72

996.72 --> 1004.0790000000001
she's just really really nice and smart

1001.839 --> 1004.0790000000001
and

1004.399 --> 1007.12
it's the same

1007.279 --> 1012.16
like

1008.16 --> 1012.16
i just want her to be good i don't even

1012.32 --> 1016.639
what i'm aiming at is friendship

1015.04 --> 1019.92
right

1016.639 --> 1021.6
it's good to say that out loud

1019.92 --> 1023.36
and then

1021.6 --> 1025.919
you know if it was meant to be it's

1023.36 --> 1028.64
meant to be but i aim for friendship i i

1025.919 --> 1028.64
just really

1030.64 --> 1035.439
i just want her to be well

1032.959 --> 1035.439
and to

1035.76 --> 1039.839
you know the crazy world out there

1044.079 --> 1047.039
trepidation

1047.52 --> 1053.2
dutch sailor chill out bro

1050.799 --> 1056.72
you're headed on that's not what

1053.2 --> 1056.72
no it's not like that

1063.76 --> 1069.039
what is trepidation

1067.2 --> 1071.76
let me look that up i just need some

1069.039 --> 1071.76
distraction

1076.0 --> 1081.4
feeling of fear anxiety about something

1077.679 --> 1081.4
that may ha yeah

1086.88 --> 1091.919
is that flat earth relate what do you

1088.72 --> 1094.48
think norwegian analog it's in

1091.919 --> 1098.039
the name of the chat

1094.48 --> 1098.039
i mean the show

1141.679 --> 1147.1200000000001
getting on with her so well well

1144.0 --> 1150.0
it's just there was a lot look

1147.12 --> 1152.6399999999999
let me try to explain this all wizardly

1150.0 --> 1155.44
and all that [ __ ]

1152.64 --> 1157.5200000000002
she's a smart person

1155.44 --> 1160.16
that means

1157.52 --> 1161.9189999999999
she has that other levels of

1160.16 --> 1165.44
consciousness

1161.919 --> 1166.64
i immediately tapped into that

1165.44 --> 1169.679
but not like

1166.64 --> 1172.3200000000002
we like oh really smooth coming no it's

1169.679 --> 1176.2
just that i'm just seeing it i'm just

1172.32 --> 1176.2
seeing what's there

1188.72 --> 1192.48
and

1189.679 --> 1194.96
like i'm getting data

1192.48 --> 1195.84
like within the moment at when that

1194.96 --> 1197.8400000000001
happened

1195.84 --> 1200.32
it's like an electric whip hitting you

1197.84 --> 1203.6
really but without the physical response

1200.32 --> 1203.6
it's purely spiritual

1204.24 --> 1208.88
and there was data that was transferring

1207.44 --> 1212.96
on a level

1208.88 --> 1215.3600000000001
that i've never seen before like this

1212.96 --> 1218.4
i think that my

1215.36 --> 1220.799
entire sensory spectrum might have been

1218.4 --> 1224.4
undergoing an upgrade since the last

1220.799 --> 1224.4
time anything like this happened

1226.24 --> 1232.28
i'm i this is

1228.4 --> 1232.2800000000002
this is this adrenaline

1239.36 --> 1243.1589999999999
can you hear my voice

1251.44 --> 1254.44
god

1268.0 --> 1272.88
right so if you've never

1270.0 --> 1275.36
watched this show before yeah this is

1272.88 --> 1277.6000000000001

oh man

1296.24 --> 1301.96
i just

1297.36 --> 1301.9599999999998

i i didn't have

1307.679 --> 1311.76
well shield preparing

1378.32 --> 1384.2
thanks for your continual support i

1380.24 --> 1384.2
really appreciate that

1389.12 --> 1392.1589999999999
not much well

1392.48 --> 1396.64

1398.4 --> 1402.2800000000002
thank you very much man

1407.76 --> 1412.28
just a pretty face who

1424.72 --> 1427.919
well

1426.32 --> 1430.8799999999999
let me

1427.919 --> 1435.44
like this is pure esoterics right this

1430.88 --> 1435.44
is all like sub communication this

1435.679 --> 1440.0
shouldn't be filling it all in like this

1438.0 --> 1442.159
it's the over excitement that really is

1440.0 --> 1445.2
pushing me to do that

1442.159 --> 1447.6000000000001
it's just that there's been a lot of

1445.2 --> 1450.48
people right that have come here in this

1447.6 --> 1454.32
house and we're like checking out rooms

1450.48 --> 1454.32
over the years i've been living here for

1454.64 --> 1458.5590000000002
oh my god

1456.08 --> 1460.48
14.

1458.559 --> 1462.32
for eight years

1460.48 --> 1464.48
right a lot of people

1462.32 --> 1466.799
probably like 30

1464.48 --> 1469.279
50.

1466.799 --> 1471.279
but every time

1469.279 --> 1473.679
there was a girl that i had like a

1471.279 --> 1475.6
really like whoa this is

1473.679 --> 1478.159
an impressive girl

1475.6 --> 1479.36
they would always just immediately shy

1478.159 --> 1482.4
away

1479.36 --> 1484.9599999999998
like instantly respond like

1482.4 --> 1486.72
don't want it

1484.96 --> 1489.039
this is the first time that didn't

1486.72 --> 1489.039
happen

1489.6 --> 1495.12
okay

1491.12 --> 1495.12
and that makes me really nervous

1499.52 --> 1501.84
ugh

1517.76 --> 1523.12
oh good i always love your content dude

1520.32 --> 1525.039
yeah i appreciate that i do my best that

1523.12 --> 1527.279
i bring forth some interesting things

1525.039 --> 1527.279
too

1527.44 --> 1532.0
along with just a bunch of awkward

1529.12 --> 1532.0
personal things

1533.039 --> 1539.6
i try to keep it to a minimum

1536.159 --> 1542.4
but yeah it is part of what i do

1539.6 --> 1543.52
it is raw it is live i am putting down

1542.4 --> 1546.4
my life

1543.52 --> 1548.1589999999999
and i'm not like making effort to

1546.4 --> 1550.96
hide

1548.159 --> 1553.8400000000001
things that influence me

1550.96 --> 1556.64
from my personal life too much

1553.84 --> 1559.1999999999998
i i do have my heart on my sleeve

1556.64 --> 1561.679
that and it's always how i've been

1559.2 --> 1563.679
it's very problematic by the way when

1561.679 --> 1566.3200000000002
you're like that a lot of the times

1563.679 --> 1569.2
people really don't want that and then i

1566.32 --> 1571.12
like must contain it

1569.2 --> 1574.76
but i can't do that for too long can

1571.12 --> 1574.76
only do that temporary

1597.36 --> 1601.279
how long is this going to be

1599.6 --> 1602.8799999999999
you want to learn some new stuff or what

1601.279 --> 1604.88
do you want to learn what are your

1602.88 --> 1609.279
questions you know

1604.88 --> 1609.279
this is how it works you ask questions

1610.0 --> 1617.12
give it all you got

1613.44 --> 1617.1200000000001
and we'll see what we could do with it

1618.08 --> 1623.9189999999999
this is not a show where i just per

1620.72 --> 1626.88
default talk about flat earth subjects

1623.919 --> 1629.1200000000001
constantly like that that is more

1626.88 --> 1631.679
flatter debate department that is really

1629.12 --> 1633.6789999999999
the place where always something flat

1631.679 --> 1635.76
earth related is going to be brought on

1633.679 --> 1637.3600000000001
the table whether it is technical

1635.76 --> 1638.96
philosophical

1637.36 --> 1640.4799999999998
psychological

1638.96 --> 1642.32
related

1640.48 --> 1644.64
that is the place where it's always

1642.32 --> 1649.2
going to be talked about right

1644.64 --> 1651.919
over here yes it is among the subjects

1649.2 --> 1654.48
but look this is i'm almost at a

1651.919 --> 1656.5590000000002
thousand shows

1654.48 --> 1657.52
i just can't

1656.559 --> 1660.8799999999999
keep

1657.52 --> 1663.2
talking about it every single day

1660.88 --> 1664.96
because it's just me here right

1663.2 --> 1666.88
the flat earth debates we got a lot of

1664.96 --> 1670.24
people

1666.88 --> 1673.5200000000002
they all have their moments their their

1670.24 --> 1676.64
blooms where they basically just

1673.52 --> 1678.48
get inspired by a detail

1676.64 --> 1680.7990000000002
and then they present their stuff right

1678.48 --> 1682.48
in that way there's always somebody to

1680.799 --> 1686.0
fill it in

1682.48 --> 1686.0
here it's just me and chad

1688.399 --> 1693.1999999999998
but hey if you have

1690.399 --> 1697.84
flat earth related questions

1693.2 --> 1697.8400000000001
there's always a place here to ask it

1699.36 --> 1704.6399999999999
so yeah bring your questions norwegian

1702.159 --> 1704.64
analog

1706.32 --> 1711.399
yes that yeah return to normal that is

1708.399 --> 1711.399
correct

1712.559 --> 1720.48
i just got a like my battery got

1716.24 --> 1720.48
overcharged right that is it so

1729.36 --> 1734.559
it is effectively a crush that is what

1731.76 --> 1736.8799999999999
this is i know it is

1734.559 --> 1738.6299999999999
i'm just not i'm trying to not let it

1736.88 --> 1741.779
get to me

1738.63 --> 1741.779
[Music]

1758.26 --> 1761.47
[Music]

1764.32 --> 1768.799
i bet you've you guys have never seen me

1766.48 --> 1768.799
so

1769.039 --> 1773.12
moving

1770.159 --> 1774.64
it's constantly

1773.12 --> 1778.36
ah

1774.64 --> 1778.3600000000001
i can't sit still

1801.44 --> 1804.88
okay

1802.399 --> 1808.559
job lost his job because of flat earth

1804.88 --> 1811.7600000000002
believes right is that in norway

1808.559 --> 1811.76
like are you in norway

1812.24 --> 1814.48
it can happen

1813.679 --> 1817.76
if

1814.48 --> 1818.88
if you are like too alarmist and overt

1817.76 --> 1820.0
about it

1818.88 --> 1822.7990000000002
yes

1820.0 --> 1824.88
because the subject

1822.799 --> 1826.96
no matter where you stand

1824.88 --> 1828.72
at with it

1826.96 --> 1831.6000000000001
in the face of what's going on in the

1828.72 --> 1834.32
world it is very triggering

1831.6 --> 1836.1589999999999
thus it's always

1834.32 --> 1837.84
probably for some time gonna be

1836.159 --> 1841.5200000000002
interpreted

1837.84 --> 1843.52
as a risk because it is destabilizing

1841.52 --> 1844.32
when it is constantly brought up right

1843.52 --> 1848.1589999999999
and

1844.32 --> 1850.399
sometimes it isn't some people like

1848.159 --> 1852.3990000000001
managed to just work it out

1850.399 --> 1855.039
like for example chocolate saiyan who

1852.399 --> 1857.4399999999998
does talk about it he literally does his

1855.039 --> 1859.679
show on the work floor

1857.44 --> 1861.76
and that works out great for him

1859.679 --> 1864.76
not without conflict but he can handle

1861.76 --> 1864.76
it

1866.64 --> 1869.44
and like his boss trusts him and all

1868.64 --> 1871.039
that

1869.44 --> 1873.679
so

1871.039 --> 1876.8799999999999
but yeah if you don't have that good

1873.679 --> 1880.72
relation connection and that grip

1876.88 --> 1883.1200000000001
if you're being very alarmist about it

1880.72 --> 1885.76
that's gonna be taken as like that's

1883.12 --> 1885.76
unstable

1887.2 --> 1893.3600000000001
so yeah that can happen people can get

1890.08 --> 1895.6789999999999
fired if they just

1893.36 --> 1898.4799999999998
get overt about flat earth all of a

1895.679 --> 1900.3200000000002
sudden and and and the colleagues like

1898.48 --> 1902.24
get really triggered over it yeah that

1900.32 --> 1904.24
can happen

1902.24 --> 1907.84
so you always got to be very careful if

1904.24 --> 1907.84
you want to bring it up

1918.559 --> 1923.039
nobody gets fired for flat earth oh

1920.72 --> 1923.039
really

1931.12 --> 1936.32
thanks jason

1932.88 --> 1939.7600000000002
i don't know if i hope that as well

1936.32 --> 1939.76
i don't know if i'm ready for that

1940.72 --> 1944.559
but if god

1943.36 --> 1947.039
allows it

1944.559 --> 1950.48
and and all the

1947.039 --> 1950.48
the check marks are there

1951.44 --> 1955.76

1953.6 --> 1958.24

seriously like this is also i'm

2145.28 --> 2148.4
revealing a little bit of my own

2146.72 --> 2150.56
personal mechanics right so this is me

2148.4 --> 2154.1600000000003
when i'm 41.

2150.56 --> 2156.32
can you imagine what kind of an impact

2154.16 --> 2159.1189999999997
girls that i connected to made on me

2156.32 --> 2162.56
like in my freaking teens

2159.119 --> 2166.48
that [ __ ] was not funny dude it was not

2162.56 --> 2169.119
funny like i was stan

2166.48 --> 2170.88
literally well not i never puked in a

2169.119 --> 2173.52
girl's face thank god

2170.88 --> 2177.28
but oh i have i puked from nerves of

2173.52 --> 2179.359
that [ __ ] right and now i'm older i can

2177.28 --> 2180.88
i i have a lot of spirit mechanic

2179.359 --> 2183.119
control

2180.88 --> 2184.1600000000003
i know just calm down i know what to

2183.119 --> 2185.52
expect

2184.16 --> 2188.16
back then

2185.52 --> 2191.2
i did not know how to calm down and i

2188.16 --> 2193.5989999999997
did not know what to expect and also

2191.2 --> 2195.2
because of just the adrenal functions of

2193.599 --> 2197.839
my body and everything

2195.2 --> 2200.3999999999996
it wouldn't just go away in an hour

2197.839 --> 2203.2
i would be sick for a week

2200.4 --> 2203.2000000000003
non-stop

2204.8 --> 2209.6800000000003
like

2205.92 --> 2212.32
love is not freaking funny dude

2209.68 --> 2213.1189999999997
it makes me sick

2212.32 --> 2217.119
but

2213.119 --> 2220.1600000000003
it is amazing though

2217.119 --> 2220.1600000000003
is not something i

2220.88 --> 2226.76
like despise it's just

2223.44 --> 2226.76
kind of scary

2233.92 --> 2239.96
i have a wife and gets the are expensive

2236.079 --> 2239.96
yeah yeah clutch bears

2248.72 --> 2253.48
love is a battlefield it can be

2263.04 --> 2270.48
i rather see it as like a great contest

2266.32 --> 2272.079
where the gods truly test your resolve

2270.48 --> 2273.52
the gods

2272.079 --> 2275.52
god

2273.52 --> 2278.0
like from any perspective that works

2275.52 --> 2278.0
from any

2278.079 --> 2283.1600000000003
because that's just exactly what it

2279.839 --> 2283.16
feels like

2284.32 --> 2288.32
and also that's what made me like so

2287.119 --> 2290.7200000000003
aware

2288.32 --> 2294.0
with my ex like what did i do wrong and

2290.72 --> 2294.0
like how did like

2294.8 --> 2298.88
like the

2295.92 --> 2301.2000000000003
the even minor sins just minor mistakes

2298.88 --> 2301.92
really minor mental

2301.2 --> 2303.52
like

2301.92 --> 2306.0
fear

2303.52 --> 2308.8
giving up weaknesses

2306.0 --> 2310.4
like how that just immediately was

2308.8 --> 2313.119
repercussioned

2310.4 --> 2315.28
not by her but just by the essence of

2313.119 --> 2318.4
how things unroll

2315.28 --> 2322.079
god tests you

2318.4 --> 2324.32
you know when i talk about that

2322.079 --> 2324.32
like

2324.96 --> 2329.44
you pay for sin immediately

2329.599 --> 2333.6800000000003
right and the more power you have the

2331.52 --> 2335.52
more energy is available to you from

2333.68 --> 2338.24
whatever source

2335.52 --> 2341.24
the the more responsibility and the

2338.24 --> 2341.24
consequences

2354.88 --> 2359.839
now

2356.079 --> 2359.8390000000004
instant karma is another concept

2361.04 --> 2365.839
that's when it like complete you get the

2363.68 --> 2366.8799999999997
full package as a giant slap in your

2365.839 --> 2369.44
face

2366.88 --> 2370.7200000000003
that's different

2369.44 --> 2372.16
but

2370.72 --> 2375.68
the payment

2372.16 --> 2377.1189999999997
unrolls in how the essence of things

2375.68 --> 2380.0
unroll

2377.119 --> 2380.96
it immediately weaves itself

2380.0 --> 2383.359
through

2380.96 --> 2385.359
what happens to you and everybody around

2383.359 --> 2387.92
you

2385.359 --> 2390.64
when you make a mistake

2387.92 --> 2393.44
like no matter what the others think

2390.64 --> 2396.68
about you right it's completely separate

2393.44 --> 2396.68
from that

2397.2 --> 2402.0789999999997
right it doesn't matter if others think

2399.839 --> 2404.4
your mistake is a sin or not or they

2402.079 --> 2406.7200000000003
don't even see it

2404.4 --> 2410.119
only thing that matters is what is and

2406.72 --> 2410.1189999999997
what is not

2421.76 --> 2426.96
law of attraction things yes it is

2424.319 --> 2426.96
involved

2429.04 --> 2433.44
you're gonna get it three minute time

2431.119 --> 2433.44
what

2436.8 --> 2442.319
nah that's fine

2438.88 --> 2442.319
you haven't said anything bad

2444.64 --> 2449.48
just don't puke all over the chat please

2458.319 --> 2461.319
okay

2474.16 --> 2478.839
right yeah drunken bullet i hope you are

2476.319 --> 2481.599
having fun though it is important

2478.839 --> 2485.44
remember i've talked about it before if

2481.599 --> 2485.44
you're gonna drink then make sure

2486.88 --> 2490.079
you don't

2488.079 --> 2492.0
you don't still have it in you when you

2490.079 --> 2494.5600000000004
go to sleep

2492.0 --> 2496.56
so don't drink too late

2494.56 --> 2499.119
don't drink too much

2496.56 --> 2500.24
and make sure above all that when you do

2499.119 --> 2502.7200000000003
it

2500.24 --> 2504.319
you're gonna have fun and that means

2502.72 --> 2507.2799999999997
also

2504.319 --> 2509.119
you have to have things in order

2507.28 --> 2511.3590000000004
for that to be possible because if

2509.119 --> 2513.2000000000003
suddenly things are gonna come rolling

2511.359 --> 2515.2
in right when you're drunk and you're

2513.2 --> 2517.52
then you're totally caught off guard and

2515.2 --> 2520.319
[ __ ] and things go wrong so you got to

2517.52 --> 2523.2
take all of that into account

2520.319 --> 2526.0
and that if it happens you

2523.2 --> 2528.16
don't get outraged

2526.0 --> 2530.96
etc right

2528.16 --> 2535.48
so take care man

2530.96 --> 2535.48
don't forget to drink plenty of water

2539.16 --> 2542.3399999999997
[Music]

2557.64 --> 2562.1189999999997
oh thank god

2566.64 --> 2572.48
finally the nerves are like

2569.52 --> 2575.839
finally coming out

2572.48 --> 2575.839
it only took an hour

2575.92 --> 2578.92
uh

2590.8 --> 2596.6400000000003
yeah okay drunken but not just drink

2593.52 --> 2598.0
water also make sure

2596.64 --> 2600.0789999999997
you

2598.0 --> 2602.72
plan ahead when you're gonna go to bed

2600.079 --> 2604.319
and then make sure you don't drink

2602.72 --> 2607.359
anymore

2604.319 --> 2609.599
a preset time before that so that when

2607.359 --> 2611.7599999999998
you eventually go to sleep

2609.599 --> 2613.92
you'll already have

2611.76 --> 2616.88
it out of your system so you got to stop

2613.92 --> 2616.88
drinking in time

2617.2 --> 2622.0
stopping with drinking is not the moment

2619.68 --> 2626.8799999999997
you fall asleep

2622.0 --> 2626.88
that's bad that's bad for your system

2627.359 --> 2631.5989999999997
because then your regeneration during

2629.839 --> 2634.599
sleep cycle is not going to function

2631.599 --> 2634.599
properly

2635.28 --> 2638.5600000000004
and it's gonna

2636.64 --> 2642.52
give you more

2638.56 --> 2642.52
long-term side effects

2663.52 --> 2665.839
what

2666.16 --> 2669.64
a big musky

2676.0 --> 2680.28
what are you talking about tom parker

2693.04 --> 2696.8
ah

2694.72 --> 2699.2799999999997
okay so you started drinking because you

2696.8 --> 2700.1600000000003
stopped smoking yeah that's

2699.28 --> 2703.4
i've

2700.16 --> 2703.3999999999996
done that

2717.359 --> 2721.7599999999998
just

2719.04 --> 2723.52
make sure you don't keep

2721.76 --> 2725.76
stacking the baubles

2723.52 --> 2727.28
right don't make sure you don't drink

2725.76 --> 2728.88
more and more and more as time

2727.28 --> 2733.0
progresses that's

2728.88 --> 2733.0
important to look out for

2740.96 --> 2743.44
what

2744.96 --> 2751.52
okay tom parker so you fall in love you

2748.079 --> 2754.8390000000004
get a crush on really big fish you catch

2751.52 --> 2754.839
that's weird

2771.119 --> 2777.2400000000002
first one can we okay drunken but well

2773.04 --> 2777.24
then you're doing better than me

2789.92 --> 2795.04
huh

2790.8 --> 2796.319
okay didn't expect that norwegian analog

2795.04 --> 2798.319
but yes

2796.319 --> 2800.64
i have actually

2798.319 --> 2804.079
tried to relay that advice myself on

2800.64 --> 2805.92
this show when somebody brought that up

2804.079 --> 2808.48
don't typically like to let me bring

2805.92 --> 2808.48
that up but

2810.24 --> 2813.9599999999996
but yeah good point

2818.64 --> 2821.64
hmm

2870.72 --> 2874.0789999999997
right yeah

2871.76 --> 2876.3190000000004
to add on a little tip with that

2874.079 --> 2878.2400000000002
norwegian

2876.319 --> 2880.64
if you're gonna do that

2878.24 --> 2883.359
then you have to also be careful as to

2880.64 --> 2883.359
what you eat

2885.28 --> 2888.1600000000003
and what you drink

2888.559 --> 2892.0
so

2889.599 --> 2893.04
it would be great if you're in optimal

2892.0 --> 2896.76
balance

2893.04 --> 2896.7599999999998
when you try that

2907.52 --> 2912.88
okay iron 26 well hey that's uh

2910.96 --> 2915.119
everybody their own you know i don't

2912.88 --> 2917.599
like it either

2915.119 --> 2920.48
but i do recognize that there is

2917.599 --> 2920.48
something to it

2922.0 --> 2925.119
like

2922.88 --> 2925.119
yeah

2925.599 --> 2932.1600000000003
to basically try to explain it from a

2929.76 --> 2936.1600000000003
yeah not too well developed medical

2932.16 --> 2937.92
perspective i it's been a long time

2936.16 --> 2939.5989999999997
since i heard about this but what i

2937.92 --> 2943.319
thought that's basically happening is

2939.599 --> 2943.319
that certain substances

2943.599 --> 2947.44
like get transformed right in the

2945.599 --> 2950.48
metabolic system there's a whole bunch

2947.44 --> 2953.92
of substances that you consume that go

2950.48 --> 2955.839
through different cycles

2953.92 --> 2957.76
they become different so they go through

2955.839 --> 2961.68
these body chemical reactions in the

2957.76 --> 2963.92
intestines etc with the liver and

2961.68 --> 2966.24
all of it

2963.92 --> 2966.2400000000002
and

2967.28 --> 2972.48
right there are certain processes

2971.119 --> 2973.839
that

2972.48 --> 2976.16
yeah

2973.839 --> 2980.96
that do something

2976.16 --> 2983.68
right and your urine then contains

2980.96 --> 2987.2
like certain particles of let's just say

2983.68 --> 2987.2
like transformed

2987.68 --> 2992.16
nutrients and it contains like internal

2990.4 --> 2995.28
medical data

2992.16 --> 2998.2799999999997
it has to do with like your immune

2995.28 --> 2998.28
system

2998.559 --> 3001.3590000000004
and yeah

3002.8 --> 3006.1600000000003
that does something for you

3006.24 --> 3011.839
it has like health restoring qualities

3009.839 --> 3014.96
but it is

3011.839 --> 3017.359
yeah it's not very desirable

3014.96 --> 3017.359
you know

3025.28 --> 3028.559
right but dude but that's different

3027.119 --> 3030.559
dutch sailor because if you're in the

3028.559 --> 3032.6400000000003
sahara it's all going to be super

3030.559 --> 3034.3190000000004
saturated because you're doing it for

3032.64 --> 3036.319
the water not

3034.319 --> 3040.44
right

3036.319 --> 3040.44
yeah that is super gross

3040.64 --> 3045.1189999999997
but dude i i don't even want to talk

3042.559 --> 3045.119
about this

3050.64 --> 3055.1189999999997
look i've i never really recommend it

3053.119 --> 3057.76
i'm just i'm just trying to be honest

3055.119 --> 3060.079
saying that there is something to it

3057.76 --> 3062.48
it's pretty ancient

3060.079 --> 3065.48
been confronted with it many times as

3062.48 --> 3065.48
well

3069.76 --> 3074.3190000000004
and yeah some people apparently they go

3072.079 --> 3075.6800000000003
for it and they just like do that

3074.319 --> 3076.88
constantly

3075.68 --> 3078.48
and

3076.88 --> 3081.119
i'm pretty sure that they do have

3078.48 --> 3084.8
benefits from that right

3081.119 --> 3084.8
and that's it that's it

3086.4 --> 3092.1600000000003
not saying you should do that or we were

3089.119 --> 3096.88
meant to do that but on the other hand

3092.16 --> 3099.1189999999997
yeah animals also have this they also do

3096.88 --> 3099.119
that

3099.28 --> 3104.1600000000003
in certain ways

3101.2 --> 3104.16
you'd be surprised

3108.64 --> 3113.1189999999997
ah dude don't

3111.04 --> 3116.119
don't think about that

3113.119 --> 3116.119
yuck

3130.96 --> 3136.2
right so yeah let's not talk about that

3148.48 --> 3153.44
well return to normal let's just say it

3150.559 --> 3157.0400000000004
like this what if you have like

3153.44 --> 3158.559
your entire system is like toxically

3157.04 --> 3161.2799999999997
shocked and

3158.559 --> 3163.76
can't restore itself

3161.28 --> 3166.3190000000004
like you're in a really bad

3163.76 --> 3169.2000000000003
place

3166.319 --> 3169.2
where you have like

3169.76 --> 3175.0400000000004
inflammations like say lacerations on

3172.8 --> 3177.8390000000004
the skin [ __ ] like you're in a really

3175.04 --> 3181.839
bad health situation

3177.839 --> 3181.839
you might be surprised what it could do

3183.119 --> 3189.44
but yeah don't just randomly do that

3186.64 --> 3191.92
[ __ ] in my opinion if it is if you're in

3189.44 --> 3194.96
like a serious medical condition

3191.92 --> 3198.559
you would have to ask some like a

3194.96 --> 3200.48
a studied alternative doctor

3198.559 --> 3202.48
that actually knows a little bit more

3200.48 --> 3207.64
about it don't just

3202.48 --> 3207.64
randomly try out stuff in my opinion

3215.2 --> 3218.5589999999997
okay see you later drunken bullet for a

3217.04 --> 3221.599
woman

3218.559 --> 3224.48
yes early fourth yeah

3221.599 --> 3224.48
i can imagine

3224.96 --> 3229.079
i'm not a big fan myself

3243.359 --> 3246.359
so

3250.88 --> 3254.96
oh clutch bear don't even go there

3258.319 --> 3261.92
oh god no it's too late

3263.2 --> 3266.839
this is just brilliant

3286.88 --> 3290.799
man i feel this sounds kind of silly i

3288.88 --> 3292.88
feel like sleeping

3290.799 --> 3297.04
like now that the nerves are going away

3292.88 --> 3297.04
i feel like i want to sleep this

3297.839 --> 3301.799
post-adrenal fatigue

3306.0 --> 3312.64
okay good night drunken bullet

3308.48 --> 3312.64
see you see you tomorrow hopefully

3314.0 --> 3317.68
yeah well we want to talk about this

3315.92 --> 3320.6800000000003
subject again

3317.68 --> 3320.68
thanks

3327.26 --> 3330.539
[Music]

3332.799 --> 3337.88
maybe it's because it's just pissing

3334.88 --> 3337.88
outside

3361.92 --> 3369.04
oh that is tony wittgen i didn't know

3364.72 --> 3369.04
that that's a remarkable story

3372.319 --> 3377.2799999999997
but yeah

3375.04 --> 3379.599
dave murphy's been into that for a long

3377.28 --> 3379.599
time

3379.68 --> 3383.48
takes it very seriously

3395.04 --> 3400.7599999999998
and fe comes okay i'll check out your

3397.119 --> 3400.76
video what is that

3408.48 --> 3411.68
uh what

3417.28 --> 3419.8390000000004
what the

3425.76 --> 3430.2000000000003
what is that supposed to mean

3438.079 --> 3443.76
okay is that some kind of an attempt of

3440.64 --> 3443.7599999999998
a holographic

3444.839 --> 3450.0789999999997
representation

3446.72 --> 3454.0789999999997
where like the middle of the

3450.079 --> 3457.92
of the donut is the observer

3454.079 --> 3457.92
it's interest it looks interesting

3458.88 --> 3462.1600000000003
i'll give that enough vote

3464.319 --> 3468.24
like did you animate that or did you

3468.72 --> 3475.3999999999996
copy it from somebody else

3471.839 --> 3475.4
it looks interesting

3486.24 --> 3490.3999999999996
cool all right so you're pretty cool

3488.48 --> 3492.72
with animation that that's in that's

3490.4 --> 3492.7200000000003
good

3496.72 --> 3503.1189999999997
so you can do like polygon modeling

3501.28 --> 3505.2000000000003
even with like

3503.119 --> 3508.6400000000003
well the maps

3505.2 --> 3508.64
that's a valuable skill

3513.839 --> 3518.319
like there's been a whole bunch of

3515.52 --> 3520.96
things like with the irregular

3518.319 --> 3523.52
looping model conception

3520.96 --> 3525.359
that i have personally been wanting to

3523.52 --> 3528.559
kind of like model out i just don't

3525.359 --> 3528.5589999999997
really know how to do it

3528.96 --> 3532.4
so i just like sketch it right with

3531.28 --> 3533.76
pencil

3532.4 --> 3536.7200000000003
very basic

3533.76 --> 3538.7990000000004
just try to describe it

3536.72 --> 3541.68
but yeah it's pretty cool if you can

3538.799 --> 3544.799
actually just use a 3d

3541.68 --> 3548.48
rendering engine

3544.799 --> 3552.64
to animate it in a 3d animation

3548.48 --> 3552.64
that opens up all kinds of possibilities

3557.52 --> 3561.24
amanda young

3573.92 --> 3579.359
multiple holo prism suns what

3579.44 --> 3585.16
holo prison wha what do you mean holo

3582.16 --> 3585.16
prism

3586.96 --> 3592.88
explains the ice age what

3590.64 --> 3597.24
okay you lost me there now

3592.88 --> 3597.2400000000002
what are you talking about iron 26

3613.92 --> 3619.359
yeah okay so

3616.72 --> 3619.359
i'm not gonna

3620.96 --> 3625.44
address that anymore anybody else that's

3623.44 --> 3626.48
gonna bring that up i'm done with you

3625.44 --> 3629.04
yeah

3626.48 --> 3631.44
i don't talk about that

3629.04 --> 3632.799
i allowed it to be brought up naturally

3631.44 --> 3634.0
addressed it

3632.799 --> 3636.0
and now

3634.0 --> 3638.079
get the [ __ ] over it

3636.0 --> 3640.48
you don't like it or shut the [ __ ] up

3638.079 --> 3643.6800000000003
and get the [ __ ] out right

3640.48 --> 3645.52
i don't do it i don't care too much for

3643.68 --> 3647.2799999999997
it i just want to give it recognition

3645.52 --> 3649.7599999999998
that it is something there is something

3647.28 --> 3652.799
to it that's it

3649.76 --> 3654.96
i don't want to talk about it right

3652.799 --> 3656.96
so if i suddenly start talking about

3654.96 --> 3658.96
something else you don't like it well

3656.96 --> 3661.92
then just shut the [ __ ] up and don't

3658.96 --> 3661.92
bring it up again

3662.079 --> 3665.44
or you're just gonna troll

3664.16 --> 3667.92
and

3665.44 --> 3671.079
i'm not accepting that

3667.92 --> 3671.079
all right

3684.72 --> 3691.359
as the sun merged the snow melts along

3687.76 --> 3693.6800000000003
the path the civilization did

3691.359 --> 3693.68
what

3696.559 --> 3700.96
i don't understand that

3699.04 --> 3703.839
but no but that doesn't make any sense

3700.96 --> 3703.839
iron 26

3708.4 --> 3713.839
hey stop i started in 80 12. good to see

3710.96 --> 3713.839
you

3717.52 --> 3723.68
now iron 26 now you're trying to go with

3721.2 --> 3724.8799999999997
the puddle theory and suggesting that

3723.68 --> 3726.8799999999997
like the

3724.88 --> 3728.799
equator

3726.88 --> 3730.6400000000003
migrates

3728.799 --> 3732.24
that's a bit of a stretch

3730.64 --> 3736.0789999999997
if that is what you were attempting to

3732.24 --> 3739.1189999999997
do with that then i don't see it

3736.079 --> 3741.76
i thought you were trying to

3739.119 --> 3745.039
show a modeling attempt of

3741.76 --> 3747.119
the holographics of the heavens

3745.039 --> 3751.2400000000002
and that's an admirable thing to attempt

3747.119 --> 3751.2400000000002
because it's very complex

3756.16 --> 3759.7599999999998
yeah you did average bear

3760.88 --> 3764.52
you're out of here

3799.76 --> 3802.559
all right and by the way guys don't

3801.119 --> 3805.2000000000003
worry about it like

3802.559 --> 3807.8390000000004
whatever you think about it that's all

3805.2 --> 3807.839
fine with me

3808.64 --> 3812.8799999999997
no dude don't wage an analog

3811.119 --> 3815.2000000000003
i didn't think you were trolling

3812.88 --> 3817.92
bringing it up i think you were just

3815.2 --> 3820.16
genuinely bringing it up and that's fine

3817.92 --> 3821.839
don't worry about it

3820.16 --> 3824.96
it's just these people that are

3821.839 --> 3826.5589999999997
constantly that are gonna whine about it

3824.96 --> 3827.92
because they can't stop thinking about

3826.559 --> 3829.6800000000003
that now

3827.92 --> 3832.319
because they're squirt boys and they get

3829.68 --> 3834.48
easily obsessed with

3832.319 --> 3838.0
foul imagery that they conjure in their

3834.48 --> 3839.92
mind because they watch porn every day

3838.0 --> 3841.839
you see that's the reason why that

3839.92 --> 3846.28
happens and that's the reason also i

3841.839 --> 3846.2799999999997
don't typically like to bring it up

3861.68 --> 3867.0
talking about squirt boys here they come

3869.52 --> 3873.92
keep your wrenches ready you know how

3871.76 --> 3873.92
this

3878.839 --> 3885.0389999999998
works still got at least another half

3882.0 --> 3885.039
hour to go so

3885.2 --> 3889.799
yeah i'll be back in two minutes

3979.119 --> 3982.119
ugh

3995.44 --> 4001.7200000000003
oh [ __ ] didn't get any sleep last night

3997.76 --> 4001.7200000000003
why not amanda young

4017.839 --> 4024.24
whoa really norwegian analog that sounds

4021.359 --> 4024.24
fascinating

4025.2 --> 4029.359
well if they if they got connections in

4027.2 --> 4030.319
the military

4029.359 --> 4035.68
that

4030.319 --> 4039.96
would probably be helpful fascinating i

4035.68 --> 4039.96
like where did you get that from

4051.92 --> 4056.4
oh wait

4054.079 --> 4056.4
all right

4056.72 --> 4059.839
okay amanda yeah

4060.24 --> 4064.3999999999996
hanging your boyfriend oh sheesh

4072.72 --> 4076.68
i hope nobody got hurt

4077.68 --> 4080.24
yeah

4078.64 --> 4083.72
i get it

4080.24 --> 4083.72
just joking

4094.319 --> 4099.359
yeah exactly steamy traveler

4096.56 --> 4099.359
hello by the way

4101.52 --> 4105.2390000000005
a nice a full chat

4114.779 --> 4117.9490000000005
[Music]

4150.799 --> 4156.6
okay iron 26 that just makes it sound

4153.199 --> 4156.599999999999
really dark

4173.52 --> 4179.719
oh never mind

4176.319 --> 4179.719
oh man

4211.12 --> 4214.88
yeah pg christian we're just joking

4213.12 --> 4216.8
around with emmanuel

4214.88 --> 4219.04
basically

4216.8 --> 4220.64
miss typing

4219.04 --> 4224.159
saying that she

4220.64 --> 4224.159000000001
was hanging her boyfriend

4226.719 --> 4230.92
this is just being silly here

4238.64 --> 4244.719
you do steamy traveler

4241.12 --> 4248.159
oh that's what i thought

4244.719 --> 4251.36
it's just for practical purposes

4248.159 --> 4251.36
it works out the best

4256.96 --> 4262.96
but yeah what is the

4258.64 --> 4262.96
the total orientation like

4267.199 --> 4272.879999999999
it's just that

4270.0 --> 4275.44
you know like the disc model has

4272.88 --> 4279.4400000000005
like points where you can immediately

4275.44 --> 4281.678999999999
say this part about it is not euclidean

4279.44 --> 4284.0
this is not an actual

4281.679 --> 4287.0
physical like a literal one-on-one

4284.0 --> 4287.0
representation

4288.56 --> 4292.56
but then again there isn't any of that

4291.36 --> 4294.799999999999
really

4292.56 --> 4299.679
so when you just realize that then

4294.8 --> 4301.92
assuming any very specific shape becomes

4299.679 --> 4304.159
convoluted one way or the other as soon

4301.92 --> 4306.8
as you suggest like oh this setup this

4304.159 --> 4308.879999999999
projection is the real thing

4306.8 --> 4310.88
even if you say oh yeah this oh we're

4308.88 --> 4314.08
gonna just show it like a globe now this

4310.88 --> 4315.52
is the real thing oh yeah oh really have

4314.08 --> 4318.239
you tried

4315.52 --> 4319.92
looking at the scale when you roll over

4318.239 --> 4322.639999999999
the map

4319.92 --> 4325.76
the maps of google earth

4322.64 --> 4328.4800000000005
if it tried scrolling

4325.76 --> 4330.64
from the equator regions to the south

4328.48 --> 4333.5199999999995
and to the north yeah you'll find that

4330.64 --> 4336.400000000001
it is not the scale so that's not a

4333.52 --> 4337.52
literal representation either

4336.4 --> 4339.679
so with

4337.52 --> 4341.360000000001
that yeah that all happening what do you

4339.679 --> 4343.04
do well

4341.36 --> 4344.799999999999
in my mind

4343.04 --> 4346.64
and i think not only mine it's just the

4344.8 --> 4348.719
most efficient to represent it as a

4346.64 --> 4351.6
rectangular

4348.719 --> 4351.6
known space

4353.199 --> 4358.639999999999
with uncertainty

4355.36 --> 4360.88
of how it all truly interconnects

4358.64 --> 4365.12
but we cannot conclude that it there is

4360.88 --> 4365.12
a center point at the north

4366.719 --> 4371.84
or that there is an outer circle at the

4369.199 --> 4371.839999999999
south

4372.0 --> 4376.08
right there might be stuff beyond that

4373.679 --> 4378.2390000000005
well if there's stuff beyond the north

4376.08 --> 4380.719
then how are you gonna suggest it's all

4378.239 --> 4381.759999999999
a literal disc that cannot be possible

4380.719 --> 4382.96
then

4381.76 --> 4385.280000000001
right

4382.96 --> 4386.4
my main issue with the whole

4385.28 --> 4388.88
modeling

4386.4 --> 4391.36
of flat earth

4388.88 --> 4391.36
is that

4391.44 --> 4395.28
it just seems like no matter what you do

4393.199 --> 4397.599999999999
you can't make it fit and that makes me

4395.28 --> 4401.12
draw in well what if

4397.6 --> 4403.280000000001
space itself was not entirely linear

4401.12 --> 4405.36
what if we just taken that for granted

4403.28 --> 4407.84
based on the

4405.36 --> 4411.199
conditioned imagination

4407.84 --> 4413.28
of the earth being above and outer space

4411.199 --> 4416.32
and there being this

4413.28 --> 4420.5599999999995
extremely fast endless euclidean

4416.32 --> 4422.08
one-on-one literal space imagined right

4420.56 --> 4423.84
you're basically made to imagine that

4422.08 --> 4424.64
there is an endless space and that it's

4423.84 --> 4428.0
all

4424.64 --> 4430.56
literal it's all euclidean in some way

4428.0 --> 4432.719
it's all supposed to be in a euclidean

4430.56 --> 4434.159000000001
literal position everything is

4432.719 --> 4437.76
within it

4434.159 --> 4440.08
well what if that is the trick what if

4437.76 --> 4443.6
the suggestion that it's all just linear

4440.08 --> 4445.44
is kind of like part of the trick

4443.6 --> 4448.4800000000005
to make you overlook that it might

4445.44 --> 4452.4
actually not be entirely linear

4448.48 --> 4454.639999999999
that space in itself isn't linear

4452.4 --> 4458.0
that there might be places you can

4454.64 --> 4460.88
literally walk a circle around

4458.0 --> 4463.199
but when you try to cross from one point

4460.88 --> 4465.76
of a circle through the center of it to

4463.199 --> 4467.5199999999995
another there's more distance there than

4465.76 --> 4469.52
should be

4467.52 --> 4473.52
right that sort of thing

4469.52 --> 4475.4400000000005
spatial non-linearity very confusing

4473.52 --> 4477.1990000000005
very confusing

4475.44 --> 4478.5599999999995
but it might exist

4477.199 --> 4483.0
i thought of it

4478.56 --> 4483.0
very very early on

4484.239 --> 4487.919999999999
but i wasn't the only one

4486.8 --> 4490.96
so

4487.92 --> 4494.08
square earth cosmology channel was

4490.96 --> 4497.04
formerly known as free energy

4494.08 --> 4501.5199999999995
he even made a fantastic model for a

4497.04 --> 4504.4
very early very very like 2015 guys like

4501.52 --> 4506.2390000000005
suddenly there was 16 which was it

4504.4 --> 4509.36
suddenly was there

4506.239 --> 4510.718999999999
and it like they made the model

4509.36 --> 4514.08
beautifully

4510.719 --> 4516.08
of rectangular looping earth

4514.08 --> 4519.6
before i had even had the chance to

4516.08 --> 4519.6
really roll out the theory

4520.0 --> 4525.36
so they kind of helped me

4522.56 --> 4526.8
solidify its conception and give it

4525.36 --> 4529.839999999999
direction

4526.8 --> 4532.159000000001
i'm using it what he made as kind of a

4529.84 --> 4533.84
standard

4532.159 --> 4536.839999999999
vantage point like that that's the

4533.84 --> 4540.159000000001
beginning of the conception of spatial

4536.84 --> 4541.28
non-linearity the looping factor

4540.159 --> 4542.4
one

4541.28 --> 4543.199
realm

4542.4 --> 4546.719
and

4543.199 --> 4550.159
tied directly in with the other end yet

4546.719 --> 4553.04
there is no geometric

4550.159 --> 4554.799999999999
going around anything

4553.04 --> 4556.96
you just go in a straight line and you

4554.8 --> 4561.28
end up in exactly the same spot just

4556.96 --> 4562.4800000000005
like the train man station in the matrix

4561.28 --> 4565.8
two

4562.48 --> 4565.799999999999
no three

4566.88 --> 4570.8
and there's other references to this

4568.56 --> 4573.52
it's just a tunnel where it loops in on

4570.8 --> 4576.08
itself right that's

4573.52 --> 4578.84
the most basic

4576.08 --> 4580.64
form of rectangular looping spatial

4578.84 --> 4583.04
non-linearity

4580.64 --> 4584.8
that can be presented the vantage point

4583.04 --> 4587.5199999999995
to really get the understanding of

4584.8 --> 4590.0
something that could potentially be

4587.52 --> 4592.159000000001
so convoluted and complicated and

4590.0 --> 4594.8
irregular

4592.159 --> 4598.32
that it's like too

4594.8 --> 4599.679
hard for any human being to really get a

4598.32 --> 4603.44
grip on it

4599.679 --> 4605.679
right could be like what if the looping

4603.44 --> 4607.199
the spatial non-linearity was like

4605.679 --> 4610.56
fractal

4607.199 --> 4610.5599999999995
it's like car

4610.88 --> 4614.28
this is

4622.96 --> 4625.84
right

4623.92 --> 4629.8
thanks for bringing that up by the way

4625.84 --> 4629.8
it's good to change subjects

4651.36 --> 4658.96
right but steamy traveler look

4654.88 --> 4661.6
my model is still not fully tested

4658.96 --> 4663.92
right but i have conceived of how to

4661.6 --> 4666.0
test it like how do you actually figure

4663.92 --> 4667.52
out the exact orientation of the earth's

4666.0 --> 4669.52
surface

4667.52 --> 4671.040000000001
in relation to the celestial lights

4669.52 --> 4672.2390000000005
right because we use the celestial

4671.04 --> 4674.4
lights

4672.239 --> 4677.5199999999995
as an anchoring point

4674.4 --> 4679.759999999999
steady correlation steady trajectory

4677.52 --> 4681.360000000001
like the circles of all the heavenly

4679.76 --> 4682.96
lights

4681.36 --> 4685.759999999999
basically

4682.96 --> 4686.96
make it predictable in how things are

4685.76 --> 4689.679
changed

4686.96 --> 4692.159
in relation to it to try to orientate

4689.679 --> 4694.4
ourselves on the earth right that's how

4692.159 --> 4697.04
that happened

4694.4 --> 4699.92
that's how the maps were really created

4697.04 --> 4703.36
based on the celestial sphere

4699.92 --> 4707.4800000000005
but what if there is just

4703.36 --> 4707.48
more weirdness to it

4707.679 --> 4714.8
we have to find out whether the derived

4712.32 --> 4718.5599999999995
convention of the equator line based on

4714.8 --> 4720.64
the celestial sun maximum

4718.56 --> 4723.6
over the seasons

4720.64 --> 4725.679
we have to figure out whether that line

4723.6 --> 4728.320000000001
in euclidean space

4725.679 --> 4730.08
is a straight line

4728.32 --> 4732.239
is a circle

4730.08 --> 4734.48
or is an incomplete circle

4732.239 --> 4737.28
when you travel at all we need to find

4734.48 --> 4739.04
that out with like absolute measured

4737.28 --> 4743.199
certainty

4739.04 --> 4744.8
like really really certain

4743.199 --> 4747.28
like what if

4744.8 --> 4749.28
you just followed the equator line

4747.28 --> 4751.84
this is hypothetical

4749.28 --> 4754.0
this is like an example

4751.84 --> 4756.56
conception example

4754.0 --> 4758.96
what if you just went around and it is

4756.56 --> 4760.84
like okay yeah you do go turn you go

4758.96 --> 4764.32
before following it

4760.84 --> 4766.400000000001
westward and yeah we do turn some

4764.32 --> 4768.799999999999
degrees but what if

4766.4 --> 4770.32
after you followed it and ended up at

4768.8 --> 4774.320000000001
the start

4770.32 --> 4777.199
it didn't add up to 360 degrees

4774.32 --> 4779.04
like what do you how do you process that

4777.199 --> 4781.08
information you see

4779.04 --> 4784.4
and if that were the case we'd have a

4781.08 --> 4788.239
mind-boggling spatial non-linearity

4784.4 --> 4790.32
on our hands an irregular loop

4788.239 --> 4793.04
because how do you explain going in a

4790.32 --> 4794.32
circle that doesn't add up to 360

4793.04 --> 4796.8
degrees

4794.32 --> 4798.5599999999995
if that happens you cannot claim a

4796.8 --> 4800.8
literal disc anymore

4798.56 --> 4801.92
it's just impossible

4800.8 --> 4804.56
right

4801.92 --> 4808.88
not saying this is what is going to roll

4804.56 --> 4808.88
out of such a test but it could be

4809.04 --> 4812.639
and it could just be a straight line

4812.88 --> 4816.400000000001
and maybe

4814.08 --> 4819.12
the weirdness is not completely finished

4816.4 --> 4820.96
because what if it is a 360 degree

4819.12 --> 4824.239
circle it does match

4820.96 --> 4824.2390000000005
well that's only

4824.56 --> 4828.159000000001
a circle

4825.92 --> 4831.12
which it would be presumed to be

4828.159 --> 4832.638999999999
euclidean literal but what if within

4831.12 --> 4834.32
that circle

4832.639 --> 4837.36
it's different

4834.32 --> 4840.159
so yeah you go the circle and then you

4837.36 --> 4843.12
have to measure the circle inside and

4840.159 --> 4848.159
outside does it also add up to 360

4843.12 --> 4850.719
degrees etc etc and that's how we truly

4848.159 --> 4853.599999999999
figure out the exact euclidean

4850.719 --> 4855.92
orientation of every little piece of

4853.6 --> 4855.92
earth

4858.239 --> 4863.28
no bad karma that's only a ball if you

4861.04 --> 4864.719
presuppose it and you imagine the

4863.28 --> 4866.5599999999995
horizon is

4864.719 --> 4868.88
leading edge of a sphere which it isn't

4866.56 --> 4871.1990000000005
because of the black swan and you can't

4868.88 --> 4873.6
say you measured r

4871.199 --> 4875.839999999999
based on it with terrestrial refraction

4873.6 --> 4878.2390000000005
because that is a paradox you can't use

4875.84 --> 4882.159000000001
the horizon

4878.239 --> 4883.919999999999
to determine r the radius of earth

4882.159 --> 4887.12
through measurement

4883.92 --> 4890.2390000000005
if there is terrestrial refraction

4887.12 --> 4893.599999999999
to not make it in the right place that

4890.239 --> 4896.48
makes no sense it's a paradox i'm sorry

4893.6 --> 4896.4800000000005
it's not sphere

4898.08 --> 4902.88
like no matter what happens it's not a

4900.239 --> 4905.12
sphere if the equator is a perfect

4902.88 --> 4908.4800000000005
straight line it's not a sphere because

4905.12 --> 4910.32
it's not going over the curve

4908.48 --> 4915.678999999999
there will be

4910.32 --> 4917.599999999999
black swan sightings on the equator line

4915.679 --> 4920.56
it's like oh yeah we're looking

4917.6 --> 4921.84
perfectly east on the equator here like

4920.56 --> 4923.76
let's say

4921.84 --> 4924.96
west africa at the coast we're looking

4923.76 --> 4927.280000000001
there it's like

4924.96 --> 4929.04
yeah yeah we can see

4927.28 --> 4932.0
majorca there that's like one of the

4929.04 --> 4934.48
islands far off the coast right

4932.0 --> 4937.36
some one there's islands like west of

4934.48 --> 4939.919999999999
africa in in the atlantic so what if you

4937.36 --> 4943.679
at some point just like yeah we just got

4939.92 --> 4946.88
the island like 20 miles away

4943.679 --> 4948.56
right that's a black swan

4946.88 --> 4951.04
right it's going to be black swan

4948.56 --> 4952.96
sightings on that equator line

4951.04 --> 4954.96
so yeah

4952.96 --> 4956.4800000000005
it doesn't work it's just going to be a

4954.96 --> 4959.199
straight line

4956.48 --> 4961.199
a straight line not a straight line

4959.199 --> 4963.678999999999
going over a

4961.199 --> 4966.4
curve not a circle

4963.679 --> 4970.1990000000005
it's not a vertical circle

4966.4 --> 4970.199
that's not what it is

4984.0 --> 4988.239
black swan is long gone

4986.239 --> 4991.28
no that's the funny thing you're banned

4988.239 --> 4993.12
by the way black swan never goes away

4991.28 --> 4994.5599999999995
once you see it

4993.12 --> 4997.36
it's there

4994.56 --> 5000.76
forever and ever

4997.36 --> 5000.759999999999
and ever

5012.32 --> 5017.08
hey julio papin good to see you

5037.36 --> 5042.32
i know average bear

5040.239 --> 5045.36
that's why i haven't already packed and

5042.32 --> 5045.36
gone out to do it

5045.76 --> 5051.1990000000005
i don't see anytime soon that i can do

5048.159 --> 5053.92
it i could never just do it on my own it

5051.199 --> 5055.919999999999
would have to be an organized effort

5053.92 --> 5060.08
and we would have to get a lot of

5055.92 --> 5064.4800000000005
freaking permissions from governments

5060.08 --> 5064.48
like in africa in asia

5065.04 --> 5069.44
in what is it

5067.76 --> 5072.639
south america

5069.44 --> 5072.638999999999
it's not going to be easy

5079.52 --> 5082.320000000001
and that's just a starter right

5081.52 --> 5084.8
because

5082.32 --> 5087.199
that would only be like the first tests

5084.8 --> 5089.1990000000005
the first orientation test

5087.199 --> 5091.44
and after that yeah it's

5089.199 --> 5093.5199999999995
very desirable to figure out the

5091.44 --> 5097.28
orientation of everything north and

5093.52 --> 5097.280000000001
south of the equator now isn't it

5097.52 --> 5100.8
they're gonna have to get even more

5099.199 --> 5105.759999999999
permissions

5100.8 --> 5105.76
from governments in those areas so

5105.84 --> 5109.56
it's not gonna be easy

5116.88 --> 5120.56
would you also be looking to sail

5118.48 --> 5123.36
between points well yes

5120.56 --> 5126.2390000000005
it has to be done on the ocean as well

5123.36 --> 5128.639
you and we're gonna have to then use the

5126.239 --> 5132.239
ocean bottom

5128.639 --> 5132.2390000000005
to orientate right

5135.199 --> 5138.159
so yeah ships

5137.36 --> 5140.159
with

5138.159 --> 5142.08
pretty powerful scanners that can

5140.159 --> 5144.08
literally visually map

5142.08 --> 5146.719
everything below us no matter how deep

5144.08 --> 5146.719
it is right

5150.4 --> 5154.5599999999995
i'm not saying like we have to scan as

5152.639 --> 5156.400000000001
deep as like the bottom of the mariana

5154.56 --> 5158.400000000001
trench or something but we're gonna have

5156.4 --> 5161.92
to reach every part of the bottom in

5158.4 --> 5161.92
order to make out features

5162.08 --> 5166.88
that we can use to basically map out the

5164.4 --> 5169.12
ocean bottom in the process

5166.88 --> 5171.04
because every part has to connect one

5169.12 --> 5173.76
has to connect to the other every single

5171.04 --> 5177.88
time in order to figure out the spatial

5173.76 --> 5177.88
orientation of this place

5187.679 --> 5190.679
hmm

5214.56 --> 5219.4400000000005
laser ranging device

5217.12 --> 5219.44
uh

5219.92 --> 5222.32
maybe

5222.4 --> 5225.839999999999
but yeah uh

5226.08 --> 5230.08
you for an airship to do that we're

5228.4 --> 5233.679
still gonna have like

5230.08 --> 5233.679
aerial permission and [ __ ]

5236.239 --> 5241.04
also that's gonna suck when you're gonna

5238.88 --> 5243.76
go right through the middle of oceans

5241.04 --> 5246.08
and there is giant storms

5243.76 --> 5247.84
like you get really disorientated

5246.08 --> 5249.04
electrical equipment

5247.84 --> 5250.32
will

5249.04 --> 5252.32
like if you're in the middle of a

5250.32 --> 5254.799999999999
thunderstorm like yeah how are you gonna

5252.32 --> 5257.04
orient it it's all

5254.8 --> 5258.400000000001
yeah there's a lot that would have to be

5257.04 --> 5263.4
considered

5258.4 --> 5263.4
in order to engage one way or the other

5277.36 --> 5280.36
hmm

5281.6 --> 5287.76
bad karma get a freaking life dude

5285.44 --> 5292.12
it's not space it's official they don't

5287.76 --> 5292.12
even officially go to space

5294.8 --> 5301.04
you need to stop being so

5297.44 --> 5303.44
rumor dependent for your arguments

5301.04 --> 5305.12
and that's to all anti-flat earthers and

5303.44 --> 5306.638999999999
ballers by the way

5305.12 --> 5309.12
like

5306.639 --> 5311.52
i know it's disappointing that every

5309.12 --> 5314.32
single time you actually try to look

5311.52 --> 5316.4800000000005
into the details of your claims it all

5314.32 --> 5319.599999999999
breaks apart i know it sucks it really

5316.48 --> 5319.599999999999
sucks to be a baller

5320.719 --> 5323.04
but

5321.6 --> 5325.84
wouldn't you

5323.04 --> 5328.159
instead of just bumping into that same

5325.84 --> 5329.679
[ __ ] over and over again

5328.159 --> 5334.0
try to

5329.679 --> 5336.2390000000005
learn from it perhaps alter your course

5334.0 --> 5339.28
huh

5336.239 --> 5341.678999999999
maybe do something about it because

5339.28 --> 5344.0
there's this saying

5341.679 --> 5344.0
yeah

5344.56 --> 5349.1990000000005
if you make a mistake

5347.28 --> 5350.639
and you keep making that mistake and you

5349.199 --> 5352.96
don't learn from it

5350.639 --> 5355.6
that's called a fool

5352.96 --> 5355.6
an idiot

5356.8 --> 5360.56
you gotta learn from your mistakes

5362.239 --> 5366.718999999999
high enough to see the curve

5364.4 --> 5366.719
yeah

5367.28 --> 5370.0
that karma

5370.08 --> 5375.04
it's no use there's black swan sightings

5373.12 --> 5376.32
it doesn't matter what you think you're

5375.04 --> 5379.04
looking at

5376.32 --> 5381.679
if it's curve or not it cannot be curved

5379.04 --> 5384.4
there's black swan sightings that cannot

5381.679 --> 5387.52
happen on the geometric ball

5384.4 --> 5387.5199999999995
that's impossible

5387.92 --> 5393.36
it isn't curved the earth is flat

5391.76 --> 5395.92
doesn't matter where you're going to

5393.36 --> 5399.04
take a peek from

5395.92 --> 5402.2390000000005
it is flat

5399.04 --> 5405.76
there are black swan sightings

5402.239 --> 5408.879999999999
it cannot ever be a ball because the

5405.76 --> 5410.639
black swan never goes away

5408.88 --> 5413.04
it stays

5410.639 --> 5415.1990000000005
forever and ever

5413.04 --> 5419.56
and ever

5415.199 --> 5419.5599999999995
and you're gonna have to deal with that

5429.56 --> 5434.84
[Music]

5431.28 --> 5434.84
what the hell

5434.96 --> 5440.56
a simple horizon from 2015 dude

5441.12 --> 5445.639
talk about old stuff

5456.159 --> 5461.799999999999
not necessarily that earth is flat wet

5462.56 --> 5466.8
no no it can't be a bigger ball either

5468.96 --> 5475.36
if it's a bigger ball then every

5472.159 --> 5478.159
every detail of heliocentrism and all

5475.36 --> 5481.759999999999
its math everything is all flushed down

5478.159 --> 5485.839999999999
the toilet all of it it's all gone

5481.76 --> 5487.92
it's all based on the entire outer space

5485.84 --> 5491.360000000001
universe how it's mapped out how

5487.92 --> 5493.76
everything is arranged within

5491.36 --> 5495.36
the cosmos according to the official

5493.76 --> 5497.84
stories

5495.36 --> 5500.88
it's all purely dependent on the earth

5497.84 --> 5502.08
being exactly

5500.88 --> 5503.76
the shape

5502.08 --> 5506.159
and size

5503.76 --> 5509.6
and geometry that it is it's all

5506.159 --> 5512.48
dependence on that to be that in order

5509.6 --> 5514.4800000000005
for the assumptions about it

5512.48 --> 5517.839999999999
to work

5514.48 --> 5520.638999999999
nothing works if it isn't exactly that

5517.84 --> 5520.639
sized ball

5522.56 --> 5526.96
what are you gonna do with your math

5524.159 --> 5529.199
it's a bigger ball oh well guess what

5526.96 --> 5531.52
everything you assumed about outer space

5529.199 --> 5532.719
it's all [ __ ] now

5531.52 --> 5534.719
so yeah

5532.719 --> 5536.2390000000005
you want a bigger ball

5534.719 --> 5538.639
take your bigger ball you can have

5536.239 --> 5540.718999999999
jupiter-sized earth but guess what as

5538.639 --> 5543.76
soon as you engage with that

5540.719 --> 5545.76
everything you assume about the heavens

5543.76 --> 5547.84
it's all gone

5545.76 --> 5550.8
you cannot get a bigger ball without

5547.84 --> 5552.88
sacrificing outer space permanently

5550.8 --> 5554.2390000000005
within your conception

5552.88 --> 5557.04
you're gonna have to embrace the

5554.239 --> 5560.638999999999
holographic globe of the heavens if you

5557.04 --> 5563.04
want to assume you live on a bigger ball

5560.639 --> 5565.52
there's no other course of action you

5563.04 --> 5565.5199999999995
can take

5565.76 --> 5570.360000000001
so think carefully about what you're

5567.36 --> 5570.36
saying

5580.639 --> 5583.639
ah

5596.32 --> 5602.92
that's right dutch sailor concavity is

5599.36 --> 5602.92
curved too

5617.6 --> 5623.280000000001
no no that doesn't average bear

5620.96 --> 5627.44
now you you seem to underestimate the

5623.28 --> 5629.679
power of the black swan there's footage

5627.44 --> 5631.36
of like a camera

5629.679 --> 5633.1990000000005
lying on

5631.36 --> 5636.799999999999
the very sand

5633.199 --> 5638.638999999999
of the beach at the edge of the ocean

5636.8 --> 5639.84
where you can see

5638.639 --> 5643.36
like

5639.84 --> 5646.639
what is it many many miles away and you

5643.36 --> 5646.639
can see the beach

5647.679 --> 5651.36
on another side

5649.52 --> 5653.92
and i'm talking about a camera like

5651.36 --> 5653.92
literally

5654.08 --> 5661.5199999999995
right over the water

5656.96 --> 5663.76
that there is no geometry

5661.52 --> 5666.320000000001
there's no spherical geometry of any

5663.76 --> 5670.2390000000005
sorts that could allow that

5666.32 --> 5673.44
it's completely impossible

5670.239 --> 5676.239
any sort of sphere will always have any

5673.44 --> 5678.5599999999995
form of geometric horizon and that means

5676.239 --> 5681.839999999999
that as soon as the observer

5678.56 --> 5683.1990000000005
touches down on that supresupposed ball

5681.84 --> 5685.6
surface

5683.199 --> 5687.839999999999
it's going to obstruct immediately the

5685.6 --> 5690.400000000001
closer you get the more is obstructed in

5687.84 --> 5691.679
the distance so you could never see

5690.4 --> 5695.36
anything

5691.679 --> 5696.8
no matter how big the ball is

5695.36 --> 5699.599999999999
yet we do

5696.8 --> 5701.360000000001
miles and miles away you see the sand on

5699.6 --> 5704.56
the beach on the other side with the

5701.36 --> 5706.48
camera right over the ocean water

5704.56 --> 5709.88
right on top of it

5706.48 --> 5709.879999999999
it's flat

5716.4 --> 5722.48
like you can't pump up the ball

5720.48 --> 5725.759999999999
like you can the economy

5722.48 --> 5725.759999999999
it doesn't work that way

5726.88 --> 5730.400000000001
not yeah it is true

5729.119 --> 5731.839999999999
it's flat

5730.4 --> 5733.5199999999995
earth is flat

5731.84 --> 5735.84
got to deal with it

5733.52 --> 5738.719
black swan

5735.84 --> 5742.400000000001
made the ball impossible and there's

5738.719 --> 5744.96
nothing you can do about it

5742.4 --> 5746.879999999999
it's not that ball i'm sorry it isn't

5744.96 --> 5748.32
and it's not a bigger ball either

5746.88 --> 5750.719
because then

5748.32 --> 5752.96
there would also not be the black swan

5750.719 --> 5755.52
observations those could not be possible

5752.96 --> 5758.0
on a bigger ball either

5755.52 --> 5761.360000000001
so unless you want to conclude that the

5758.0 --> 5763.52
earth is an unlimited sized ball

5761.36 --> 5766.32
which is kind of preposterous

5763.52 --> 5768.84
it would basically be engaging at the

5766.32 --> 5770.4
endless plane

5768.84 --> 5771.92
theory

5770.4 --> 5774.4
and then you could imagine it was just

5771.92 --> 5776.2390000000005
too big we could never measure out like

5774.4 --> 5778.32
what the geometry is because it's just

5776.239 --> 5780.32
too big that's just holding on to

5778.32 --> 5782.96
beliefs then

5780.32 --> 5782.96
it's flat

5783.04 --> 5787.76
let's let's just go with the data we got

5785.199 --> 5787.759999999999
it's flat

5792.96 --> 5795.28
right

5796.0 --> 5799.84
and hey if you want a challenge if you

5797.84 --> 5802.96
have any technical data you would like

5799.84 --> 5804.88
to use to challenge that notion why

5802.96 --> 5809.28
don't you go on the flat earth debates

5804.88 --> 5809.28
on nathan oakley 1980 channel

5810.159 --> 5814.96
check him out i'm on there as well

5813.119 --> 5817.92
and see if you can answer some of the

5814.96 --> 5819.52
housekeeping questions which are being

5817.92 --> 5823.4400000000005
read out

5819.52 --> 5825.4400000000005
every single show at the start of it

5823.44 --> 5827.5199999999995
the start of the live show

5825.44 --> 5829.199
and then see if you can find your way

5827.52 --> 5831.1990000000005
through there and hey if you really

5829.199 --> 5833.5199999999995
think you got something

5831.199 --> 5836.239
then you could even go on

5833.52 --> 5838.400000000001
the show through the discord

5836.239 --> 5841.678999999999
and be part of the show verbally to

5838.4 --> 5843.92
speak to share your information

5841.679 --> 5843.92
right

5848.48 --> 5854.48
no beefy bake fed is a debate it's just

5852.08 --> 5856.0
the debate is over we

5854.48 --> 5857.5199999999995
won

5856.0 --> 5862.159
we did

5857.52 --> 5865.119000000001
we really really did it's over

5862.159 --> 5867.759999999999
the ball is nothing but a memory now a

5865.119 --> 5869.36
memory of something you thought that was

5867.76 --> 5871.4400000000005
and never was

5869.36 --> 5876.08
it was conjured it's a wizard spell the

5871.44 --> 5877.28
biggest spell ever unleashed on mankind

5876.08 --> 5879.679
very

5877.28 --> 5881.679
inspiring i thought

5879.679 --> 5884.0
i was caught up in a very long time but

5881.679 --> 5886.56
it's never true it never will be true

5884.0 --> 5889.36
but on the other hand

5886.56 --> 5892.400000000001
it doesn't have to be true right we

5889.36 --> 5895.119
enjoy a good book

5892.4 --> 5898.159
we enjoy a good fantasy book

5895.119 --> 5900.96
and maybe even some sci-fi stuff

5898.159 --> 5903.36
if it's not all too dystopic and [ __ ]

5900.96 --> 5905.44
too anti-human

5903.36 --> 5907.119
we can enjoy that well we know that's

5905.44 --> 5908.879999999999
not real

5907.119 --> 5911.36
right

5908.88 --> 5912.4800000000005
specifically no this is not real it's

5911.36 --> 5913.28
fantasy

5912.48 --> 5915.28
right

5913.28 --> 5919.239
well we if we can enjoy that then why

5915.28 --> 5921.599999999999
wouldn't we be able to enjoy

5919.239 --> 5923.44
heliocentric conceptions

5921.6 --> 5925.92
in the same manner it's just that if you

5923.44 --> 5928.159
hold on to the notion that it must be

5925.92 --> 5930.2390000000005
real and all flat earthers are wrong

5928.159 --> 5932.08
then you're just

5930.239 --> 5934.08
shooting yourself in the foot you're

5932.08 --> 5936.719
just unwilling to

5934.08 --> 5939.92
move beyond and learn

5936.719 --> 5942.4
from it all you're stuck you're stuck on

5939.92 --> 5945.119
the belief the earth must be a ball or

5942.4 --> 5948.4
everything goes to hell

5945.119 --> 5950.96
and that's really your problem

5948.4 --> 5952.48
and yeah with some people that problem

5950.96 --> 5954.639
haunts you

5952.48 --> 5958.5599999999995
your entire lifetime and you will be

5954.639 --> 5960.32
rambling off the same triggered [ __ ]

5958.56 --> 5962.719
of when you were

5960.32 --> 5964.799999999999
15 or something

5962.719 --> 5966.4800000000005
on your 80th birthday you will still

5964.8 --> 5970.159000000001
ramble the same [ __ ]

5966.48 --> 5970.159
because you can't get over it

5970.56 --> 5973.52
and i know it is a bit of a

5972.0 --> 5975.52
disappointment

5973.52 --> 5979.6
but really once you realize what you

5975.52 --> 5982.4800000000005
really have it's not that disappointing

5979.6 --> 5985.84
the world is still a miraculous

5982.48 --> 5987.119
amazing place and there's so much more

5985.84 --> 5988.56
to be

5987.119 --> 5989.679
found

5988.56 --> 5992.2390000000005
and

5989.679 --> 5994.88
be fascinated by

5992.239 --> 5996.879999999999
then you take for granted at first

5994.88 --> 5999.28
that you gotta wake up to what is real

5996.88 --> 6001.04
and what is fake

5999.28 --> 6003.679
otherwise you're not gonna get those

6001.04 --> 6003.679
rewards

6007.199 --> 6009.839999999999
right

6014.96 --> 6019.04
so yeah i'm rounding out the show thanks

6016.88 --> 6020.08
everyone for coming i hope you liked the

6019.04 --> 6022.719
show

6020.08 --> 6025.28
and if you didn't i don't really care

6022.719 --> 6027.36
right i see this crazy pile of down

6025.28 --> 6031.04
votes so i think it's just the anti-flat

6027.36 --> 6031.04
earthers they just found me again

6031.52 --> 6036.56
and they have to squirt

6033.119 --> 6038.96
because they are religiously inclined to

6036.56 --> 6041.4400000000005
make flat earthers look bad no matter

6038.96 --> 6044.96
the cost we are the ultimate enemy

6041.44 --> 6047.599999999999
that they cannot inform themselves about

6044.96 --> 6051.28
because if they did they would lose the

6047.6 --> 6053.360000000001
point of everything they do

6051.28 --> 6055.92
anyway

6053.36 --> 6058.159
if you like the show however

6055.92 --> 6060.2390000000005
then please don't forget to rogan's it
