you

42.27 --> 44.330000000000005
you

82.75 --> 87.09
you're right I forgot the sound that's a

85.78 --> 92.28
long time

87.09 --> 95.31
yeah forgot the mute button good morning

92.28 --> 98.35
welcome to Flat Earth early-bird number

95.31 --> 99.73
488 and your host Arwen and before we

98.35 --> 101.58999999999999
start to show please don't forget to

99.73 --> 103.45
share it on any platform you deem fit

101.59 --> 105.16
and if you haven't already subscribed to

103.45 --> 107.08
my channel and hit the bell notification

105.16 --> 109.56
so you know when I'm going live if

107.08 --> 112.27
everything is well because these days

109.56 --> 113.43
seems like the no bail notification

112.27 --> 116.44
doesn't

113.43 --> 119.38000000000001
really work all that well so you might

116.44 --> 123.58
have to indeed go to my channel directly

119.38 --> 126.24
as George Sanford said the yeah to see

123.58 --> 129.42
me go live so

126.24 --> 132.69
but anyway yeah

129.42 --> 132.69
right oh

135.09 --> 140.41
yeah and please also do support me and

138.49 --> 142.60000000000002
my channel through the PayPal patreon my

140.41 --> 145.89
GoFundMe and the super chat that will be

142.6 --> 148.62
much appreciated so

145.89 --> 151.79999999999998
the weather today is

148.62 --> 155.22
yeah pretty similar to yesterday

151.8 --> 155.22
it's pretty beautiful

155.31 --> 161.019
and

157.709 --> 164.38
again bit of those weird weird when wind

161.019 --> 166.89000000000001
feathery clouds or those I don't know

164.38 --> 166.89
that I

166.92 --> 173.76899999999998
don't know if they're like originally

169.33 --> 176.65
chemtrails I'm not sure probably not and

173.769 --> 179.38
I haven't seen any kind of chemtrails we

176.65 --> 182.86
go long at all and kind of happy about

179.38 --> 185.44
that so also there's not too much wind

182.86 --> 189.51000000000002
and even though it is fresh because it's

185.44 --> 192.34
a little it's really nice and warm and

189.51 --> 194.82
the birds are really enjoying it a lot

192.34 --> 194.82
in

195.87 --> 202.34900000000002
like I can see a lot of pair bonding

199.65 --> 205.01000000000002
going on especially with the birds it's

202.349 --> 208.58999999999997
like very telling and

205.01 --> 211.319
pretty beautiful and also yeah with the

208.59 --> 212.629
with people out there it seems to fire

211.319 --> 215.19
up as well

212.629 --> 218.569
kind of firing up with me as well but

215.19 --> 221.569
yeah it's a little bit more complicated

218.569 --> 221.569
yeah

222.2 --> 229.29
although eventually doesn't have to be

226.549 --> 232.25
all right so let's see who is in Chad I

229.29 --> 235.879
got green tea with me

232.25 --> 239.659
and yeah I had my

235.879 --> 242.97
hangout set even from yesterday um

239.659 --> 247.29
because Nathan Oakley didn't go live

242.97 --> 249.51
just no show no warning nobody really

247.29 --> 251.629
knew what was going on it was kind of

249.51 --> 254.459
weird

251.629 --> 257.15999999999997
but then eventually later in the evening

254.459 --> 260.299
he did show up and started a good

257.16 --> 260.29900000000004
premiere of a good episode

261.019 --> 268.11
so yeah I wonder

264.47 --> 269.3
what exactly happened he has told these

268.11 --> 274.31
so

269.3 --> 274.31
mm-hmm but that happened

279.61 --> 286.47
oh

280.65 --> 286.46999999999997
and Benjamin gravy just as usual

300.46 --> 305.97999999999996
right oh yeah I was gonna look through

302.74 --> 308.92
who's in chat completely stopped anyway

305.98 --> 313.86
I didn't know who was first a GM at

308.92 --> 313.86
least first shows up in my chat

314.58 --> 324.53999999999996
Steve George Sanford and ends at Deep

321.54 --> 324.54
20.0

324.69 --> 330.6
more colored

327.15 --> 334.83
over moco Steve

330.6 --> 334.83000000000004
lumberjack Patricia Dockery

335.28 --> 341.07
fat bike Nomad Tom Parker Colin dresser

341.82 --> 345.33
860 our MC

345.36 --> 349.14
yeah good to see you all

358.93 --> 365.88
I write this warning message

361.93 --> 369.49
sounds like sleeping warrior does it no

365.88 --> 371.71
yeah whatever man I'm not following

369.49 --> 373.259
Randi's anymore I don't know who of you

371.71 --> 377.00899999999996
is but

373.259 --> 380.58000000000004
I'm just not doing it

377.009 --> 383.58000000000004
he's going so far into just

380.58 --> 383.58
nonsense

384.509 --> 389.59000000000003
and I don't know in a way I hope for him

388.0 --> 391.539
he doesn't really believe it because

389.59 --> 395.02
that would be bad I think he probably

391.539 --> 397.09
doesn't but yeah he may be under

395.02 --> 399.69899999999996
estimating what happens when you

397.09 --> 402.54999999999995
constantly talk that frequency you know

399.699 --> 403.62
even though you think you know it's not

402.55 --> 406.21000000000004
real

403.62 --> 410.639
that kind of [Â __Â ] starts to affect you

406.21 --> 410.63899999999995
eventually so we'll see what happens

413.789 --> 418.06
yeah the kind of the same thing by the

416.259 --> 420.58000000000004
waited like it's probably one of the

418.06 --> 423.01
last times I'm gonna mention it lifts

420.58 --> 425.83
the veil Nathan Stallman you know that's

423.01 --> 429.99
a pretty good stuff but since the corona

425.83 --> 433.21
situation is just so I

429.99 --> 437.289
don't know it's just drowning in the

433.21 --> 438.63
fear porn of it then makes some really

437.289 --> 442.51
bad

438.63 --> 446.25
suggestions at times it's just do like

442.51 --> 449.65
I'm not gonna watch that anywhere

446.25 --> 453.4
you know I kind of held on to it also

449.65 --> 456.0
because of just news situations but I

453.4 --> 459.48999999999995
you know everybody's

456.0 --> 461.53
streaming all that so I'm not even I

459.49 --> 462.84000000000003
don't even need to go there just for

461.53 --> 465.48999999999995
that I

462.84 --> 468.539
rather much rather watch it over at ugly

465.49 --> 468.539
Jews or something

472.78 --> 476.32
very good sermon

478.75 --> 486.07
yeah I'm getting really sick of the

481.43 --> 486.07
people obsessing over Corona and stuff

491.41 --> 498.1
and with over the corona I mean the

495.36 --> 500.92
the presupposition based medical story

498.1 --> 503.56
behind it and it doesn't seem to matter

500.92 --> 507.18
like how many alternative information is

503.56 --> 510.6
being introduced they just ignore it I

507.18 --> 510.6
don't get it

510.93 --> 514.159
[Music]

516.96 --> 523.24
yeah me neither misery bear

520.95 --> 526.9000000000001
although there seems to be plenty of

523.24 --> 529.05
people just still going there I don't

526.9 --> 532.8299999999999
see a lot of ball trawlers

529.05 --> 536.5799999999999
baller trolls ball trawlers

532.83 --> 536.58
baller trolleys

537.36 --> 543.03
people with baller baggage you know

540.16 --> 547.3299999999999
baller trolleys

543.03 --> 549.0899999999999
better save the moon landing and

547.33 --> 551.6800000000001
satellites

549.09 --> 557.01
got to protect them from the madness of

551.68 --> 557.01
Flat Earth baller trollese yeah

557.16 --> 564.13
but they still hang around there and

560.52 --> 566.02
so do the savannahs people that just

564.13 --> 569.88
spiral out of control anyway that seem

566.02 --> 574.18
to have a you have severe trouble

569.88 --> 576.67
sighs yeah setting a limit to where they

574.18 --> 578.38
should be going and they'll seem to be

576.67 --> 580.2099999999999
hanging around there it's very telling

578.38 --> 582.13
you just I don't even have to listener

580.21 --> 584.23
if I just click on I can just watch it

582.13 --> 589.53
all the names and Chad and who is in and

584.23 --> 593.0500000000001
just yeah that's exactly what they are

589.53 --> 594.93
or at least that's what they're not

593.05 --> 597.39
right now

594.93 --> 600.64
we'll see where it goes

597.39 --> 602.85
but yeah I don't I don't really go there

600.64 --> 602.85
anymore

604.81 --> 610.9399999999999
that's because I'm not talking about

607.1 --> 612.83
flat earth much what is there to say you

610.94 --> 614.7800000000001
know do I constantly need to get caught

612.83 --> 618.47
up in the false dichotomy of the disc

614.78 --> 620.93
versus the ball for example because yeah

618.47 --> 624.0500000000001
that could go on it's like ping pong you

620.93 --> 627.56
know but I've already identified all the

624.05 --> 629.5
flaws so has Nathan also but yeah Nathan

627.56 --> 632.39
just keeps on I

629.5 --> 633.22
don't know what that yeah he'd against

632.39 --> 635.29
the

633.22 --> 638.77
religious fanatics

635.29 --> 642.26
that's his thing

638.77 --> 644.0
for me I really more like a Cosmo genus

642.26 --> 648.3199999999999
I did want to know I want to figure out

644.0 --> 650.17
but yeah I'm ready I put out all the

648.32 --> 653.24
things I

650.17 --> 654.8499999999999
drop it around wherever I can and I do

653.24 --> 658.4
it all the time

654.85 --> 660.5500000000001
but yeah beyond that point because as I

658.4 --> 663.4399999999999
present these things

660.55 --> 666.8299999999999
like what is the orientation of the

663.44 --> 668.84
diverging equator line is that a

666.83 --> 671.3000000000001
straight line is an arc is that it is it

668.84 --> 674.9
a circle that kind of thing yeah people

671.3 --> 676.52
do they get it when I say that it's not

674.9 --> 680.12
that difficult to understand and when I

676.52 --> 681.28
present it when I visualize it and

680.12 --> 685.24
explain it

681.28 --> 688.1899999999999
but then they know to like yeah

685.24 --> 691.34
honestly they don't really know for sure

688.19 --> 693.23
either that's so there there's not gonna

691.34 --> 696.86
be a lot of responses like but yeah

693.23 --> 699.79
where I have the data for sure no

696.86 --> 704.1800000000001
because nobody freakin does so it seems

699.79 --> 707.14
you know so yeah what then becomes left

704.18 --> 709.76
for me to do well it's like

707.14 --> 712.46
it's like a border beyond that point

709.76 --> 714.98
it's just people there's nothing to

712.46 --> 717.62
build upon beyond that point people are

714.98 --> 719.78
not responding there's no more data so

717.62 --> 723.23
all that's left for me beyond that point

719.78 --> 725.4399999999999
is just to go presuppositional go into

723.23 --> 729.32
okay the options the possibilities

725.44 --> 733.0400000000001
looping irregular loops you know the

729.32 --> 736.6
whole works then yep the bending of

733.04 --> 739.75
space you know kinds of weird ways

736.6 --> 740.91
or rather bending the rearranging of the

739.75 --> 742.78
new spatial

740.91 --> 745.03
limits of the realm and how to

742.78 --> 747.54
interconnect and all that and yeah but

745.03 --> 751.42
that that's pretty much just

747.54 --> 754.48
science fiction technically because I

751.42 --> 757.0
don't know for sure there needs to be

754.48 --> 760.39
specific data figured out in order to

757.0 --> 765.93
establish the ground works for any kind

760.39 --> 765.93
of setup yeah so who knows

767.97 --> 773.74
you know it it might get

772.17 --> 775.53
complicated

773.74 --> 779.47
it might

775.53 --> 780.88
yeah seem like it's very simple even and

779.47 --> 783.85
then turn out to be much more

780.88 --> 786.67
complicated behind that you know I

783.85 --> 790.48
wouldn't underestimate the challenges of

786.67 --> 793.56
the creator when it comes to that so

790.48 --> 798.4
what if for example the equator line

793.56 --> 803.6999999999999
does appear to be like a disc oh sorry

798.4 --> 803.6999999999999
disc a circle right you just but

804.18 --> 811.3599999999999
yeah it's like a circle right there it's

808.51 --> 816.48
like yeah we're moving the C it's gonna

811.36 --> 821.23
yeah but then when you basically

816.48 --> 823.0600000000001
move to the north or the south faithing

821.23 --> 824.74
phasing either east or west and you try

823.06 --> 827.53
to do the same thing that's suddenly

824.74 --> 829.29
that circle length doesn't add up

827.53 --> 831.88
anymore

829.29 --> 834.36
yeah now you're gonna get into a very

831.88 --> 836.98
weird territory and

834.36 --> 839.32
because of the weirdness at the same

836.98 --> 841.84
time the ballers certainly will get

839.32 --> 845.44
slightly more enthusiastic because they

841.84 --> 847.45
realize subconsciously how freakin weird

845.44 --> 849.22
the realm really is and how that

847.45 --> 852.97
confuses everyone and how that gives

849.22 --> 855.61
them an edge to kind of tried to trick

852.97 --> 859.69
people again into three supposing it's a

855.61 --> 861.25
ball so every time and this is gold it's

859.69 --> 863.1700000000001
been going on from the start you know I

861.25 --> 865.42
was kind of a troublemaker because I was

863.17 --> 868.5999999999999
trying to show the false dichotomy

865.42 --> 870.4699999999999
between disc and the ball very early on

868.6 --> 872.75
and people just thought I was a

870.47 --> 875.24
we're almost I said no no no the equator

872.75 --> 877.46
it probably is a straight line and

875.24 --> 878.96
abolish fur yeah yeah listen to our way

877.46 --> 881.12
yes it's a straight line around the

878.96 --> 883.51
curve no no no no no no curve no it's

881.12 --> 887.68
just a straight line

883.51 --> 890.39
but the ballers will love to use any

887.68 --> 891.43
surreal element that may be there in

890.39 --> 895.28
reality

891.43 --> 897.41
to basically abuse the situation of the

895.28 --> 899.78
surreal nosov it to try to suggest

897.41 --> 903.1999999999999
mothball machinations to fool people

899.78 --> 905.8299999999999
it's a ball again see this just this is

903.2 --> 908.35
not gonna stop people

905.83 --> 911.6500000000001
it doesn't stop

908.35 --> 914.78
it like yeah in

911.65 --> 919.84
from a perspective of sound logic and

914.78 --> 919.8399999999999
empiricism we're absolutely in the right

920.14 --> 926.81
the flat earthers and even discourse

923.81 --> 928.64
have certain levels it's like acceptable

926.81 --> 930.6199999999999
levels of presupposition as long as it's

928.64 --> 931.75
clear that it is free supposition you

930.62 --> 934.25
know like that

931.75 --> 936.17
ballers have absolutely nothing like

934.25 --> 938.12
that they all have the machinations but

936.17 --> 940.4
it doesn't matter to them they just keep

938.12 --> 943.79
on going and when you then look out

940.4 --> 945.9499999999999
further into the awakening as we're like

943.79 --> 949.4
what what may happen when certain things

945.95 --> 950.98
I discover yet they may get new well you

949.4 --> 955.85
could call even like Grabel ground

950.98 --> 957.4300000000001
because of the confusion of reality when

955.85 --> 960.7900000000001
it hits before

957.43 --> 963.6099999999999
see so we're not giving up yet

960.79 --> 967.66
it's

963.61 --> 970.03
this is a weird weird

967.66 --> 972.5799999999999
moment in history

970.03 --> 975.5799999999999
when concerns that

972.58 --> 978.35
hmm but yeah

975.58 --> 979.87
the equator may turn out to be a

978.35 --> 985.3000000000001
straight line

979.87 --> 989.32
no curve no concave curvature no

985.3 --> 991.7199999999999
convex curvature it's it's pretty much

989.32 --> 995.36
geometrically straight

991.72 --> 999.13
like a straight line is in this case a

995.36 --> 1001.67
literal straight line like especially

999.13 --> 1004.46
perfectly straight right yeah

1001.67 --> 1007.0899999999999
so it's not just trade in a certain

1004.46 --> 1010.25
orientation it's not as straight as in

1007.09 --> 1011.95
forward backward left right straight no

1010.25 --> 1015.13
no no it's

1011.95 --> 1018.11
absolutely straight then in that case

1015.13 --> 1020.09
yeah and it you come back at the same

1018.11 --> 1023.3000000000001
point you try to imagine that yeah

1020.09 --> 1027.41
confused to so many people well if they

1023.3 --> 1029.6299999999999
could at some point kind of imagine that

1027.41 --> 1032.23
the rail may turn out to be looping at

1029.63 --> 1035.39
least in east to west direction

1032.23 --> 1039.32
then if they can handle that then

1035.39 --> 1043.2800000000002
certainly yeah it's like okay okay that

1039.32 --> 1046.9589999999998
makes it a lot less confusing if you can

1043.28 --> 1046.959
overcome the loop

1048.07 --> 1055.31
and I hope that maybe

1051.73 --> 1058.9
over time that will gradually start to

1055.31 --> 1062.1799999999998
sink in but yeah for in order for that

1058.9 --> 1064.9
I'd first have to actually prove the

1062.18 --> 1068.51
equate equatorial orientation

1064.9 --> 1071.39
because I have strong suspicions but

1068.51 --> 1073.61
that's really it I don't really know I

1071.39 --> 1075.91
just know that the maps that we got to

1073.61 --> 1078.28
see are all projections they're

1075.91 --> 1081.14
literally none of them are to scale

1078.28 --> 1082.52
that's pretty much the important factor

1081.14 --> 1084.1100000000001
when you know that none of it is the

1082.52 --> 1087.86
skill you know that none of it is

1084.11 --> 1090.25
literal as you see it it's as simple as

1087.86 --> 1093.59
that and

1090.25 --> 1096.74
by the way neither is it with any ball

1093.59 --> 1099.29
projection remember the Google Earth I

1096.74 --> 1101.47
had a special hangout about it and was

1099.29 --> 1103.8799999999999
on the Flat Earth debate an item

1101.47 --> 1105.16
if in the Google Earth the Google Maps

1103.88 --> 1108.6200000000001
that we use

1105.16 --> 1111.98
when you move around that ball around

1108.62 --> 1115.01
the earth as you scroll you can North

1111.98 --> 1117.43
the South you can literally see the

1115.01 --> 1120.32
scale size growing and shrinking

1117.43 --> 1124.16
depending on the region so it's not the

1120.32 --> 1127.34
scale it's not literal as you see do you

1124.16 --> 1130.16
understand so even the ball doesn't

1127.34 --> 1132.59
matter there doesn't seem to be any kind

1130.16 --> 1137.5400000000002
of map projection that makes everything

1132.59 --> 1139.04
exact as is in a literal sense it might

1137.54 --> 1140.96
not be possible

1139.04 --> 1143.78
well what would an explanation for that

1140.96 --> 1145.0
be well maybe because the space may not

1143.78 --> 1147.71
be linear and

1145.0 --> 1151.09
the earth realm may be in a some kind of

1147.71 --> 1151.0900000000001
weird irregular loop

1151.84 --> 1160.37
yeah the speciality of it may be in an

1157.01 --> 1163.46
irregular loop in some way so yeah that

1160.37 --> 1167.0
is my conceptual explanation as to why

1163.46 --> 1170.8700000000001
we cannot or why nobody seems to be able

1167.0 --> 1174.68
to actually show a map projection that

1170.87 --> 1176.3799999999999
is perfectly to scale as it is in a

1174.68 --> 1178.93
literal

1176.38 --> 1182.18
spatial sense

1178.93 --> 1185.42
see so that is kind of partially also a

1182.18 --> 1188.8700000000001
reason why I hold on to the concept of

1185.42 --> 1190.8500000000001
the rectangular looping realm because

1188.87 --> 1194.53
there's just these signs out there and

1190.85 --> 1197.24
they they're not being overturned

1194.53 --> 1199.19
nobody really picks up on it and though

1197.24 --> 1200.81
they don't have to they just have to dig

1199.19 --> 1202.6000000000001
through things and that's they're

1200.81 --> 1206.03
digging through it they dig up stuff

1202.6 --> 1208.28
they dig for certain things but they

1206.03 --> 1211.34
yeah all kinds of things come up and I

1208.28 --> 1214.61
kind of my subconsciously takes very

1211.34 --> 1216.6999999999998
careful notice of it all not cognitively

1214.61 --> 1219.37
but just I

1216.7 --> 1221.66
think it's

1219.37 --> 1224.6299999999999
it's like an energy graph I can't

1221.66 --> 1227.1200000000001
explain it when it's like it's very

1224.63 --> 1229.3300000000002
subconscious but ever a member I just

1227.12 --> 1232.28
keep track

1229.33 --> 1234.1399999999999
because if I see something really unique

1232.28 --> 1237.17
significant even if I don't fully

1234.14 --> 1239.98
understand the implications of it I feel

1237.17 --> 1242.6000000000001
that in a spike moment and that moment

1239.98 --> 1247.27
becomes an important memory even though

1242.6 --> 1247.27
I don't know why yeah it just happens

1251.55 --> 1257.1299999999999
so yeah I'm not talking about Flat Earth

1254.02 --> 1257.1299999999999
enough how about that

1273.78 --> 1280.269
[Music]

1283.539 --> 1288.279
yeah it's funny how anecdote oh I've

1286.7 --> 1291.169
become

1288.279 --> 1295.58
like every time now I bring in up a

1291.169 --> 1297.2
subject I kind of make an adult sort of

1295.58 --> 1299.59
is that the right terminology I

1297.2 --> 1302.5
basically have like a history

1299.59 --> 1304.789
reference like how things came up now

1302.5 --> 1306.399
and all that I seem to have a pretty

1304.789 --> 1311.809
good memory for that

1306.399 --> 1314.029
is its yeah I have it for my life as

1311.809 --> 1317.029
well so it seems so I don't know it's

1314.029 --> 1320.83
kind of funny I never really even

1317.029 --> 1320.83
realized how that works I

1321.549 --> 1325.75
when I was younger I thought my memory

1323.96 --> 1328.94
was very unreliable

1325.75 --> 1330.59
because yeah when I got stressed out or

1328.94 --> 1333.49
something my mind would just blank I

1330.59 --> 1337.509
will turn into a complete [Â __Â ]

1333.49 --> 1341.409
but yeah this is

1337.509 --> 1341.409
things have changed

1350.15 --> 1356.0700000000002
it wasn't an argument you men sir

1353.16 --> 1358.6200000000001
mentioned not many ballers I offered a

1356.07 --> 1360.95
reason why I don't know exactly what you

1358.62 --> 1360.9499999999998
mean with that

1382.299 --> 1388.44
oh goody Dave agreed

1385.559 --> 1391.809
yeah I

1388.44 --> 1395.049
got a message it's like really annoying

1391.809 --> 1397.69
to me really but like one of the guys

1395.049 --> 1400.599
from my D&D group you know I did mention

1397.69 --> 1405.45
to them in the in our shared discord

1400.599 --> 1407.4399999999998
room where we just meet set dates I

1405.45 --> 1409.059
told him like oh yeah the room

1407.44 --> 1410.7
downstairs has become available again

1409.059 --> 1413.979
you know the

1410.7 --> 1416.249
that girl that kind of emergency moved

1413.979 --> 1420.909
in there she found a new

1416.249 --> 1423.089
proper house so very happy for and yeah

1420.909 --> 1425.709
great time to do it because

1423.089 --> 1429.07
yes there's not gonna be a lot of

1425.709 --> 1431.229
traffic it's an easy time for moving if

1429.07 --> 1434.7089999999998
you got enough people to help you with

1431.229 --> 1437.229
that and I don't she doesn't seem to be

1434.709 --> 1439.059
very frightful of Corona things and all

1437.229 --> 1442.029
that although I don't know for sure she

1439.059 --> 1445.719
but she's not like spiraling audibly

1442.029 --> 1448.239
about it she has had colds I've heard

1445.719 --> 1449.6090000000002
but yeah everybody gets a cold you know

1448.239 --> 1452.6190000000001
it's not an issue

1449.609 --> 1454.779
yeah although I do get it as well but

1452.619 --> 1457.389
it's just missed barely so shows any

1454.779 --> 1460.69
symptoms and it goes over stops very

1457.389 --> 1462.07
quickly anyway so she moved out and

1460.69 --> 1465.6090000000002
there's this room available again for

1462.07 --> 1468.639
gaming but then like one of the gamers

1465.609 --> 1472.049
guys didn't the Swedish guy who's

1468.639 --> 1476.6689999999999
awesome but it's just he's Swedish

1472.049 --> 1480.989
and he's just no I don't feel safe

1476.669 --> 1480.989
coming out until June first

1482.549 --> 1491.039
surprise surprise

1484.919 --> 1495.3890000000001
so yeah unfortunately I guess I

1491.039 --> 1498.579
have to leave the DND for a while

1495.389 --> 1501.359
or maybe he's just gonna stay I mean the

1498.579 --> 1505.21
other two who are Dutch maybe they're

1501.359 --> 1508.48
just like yeah sorry

1505.21 --> 1509.89
I'm just gonna go and get my game and I

1508.48 --> 1511.81
totally would respect that and I

1509.89 --> 1514.99
wouldn't punish the the character of the

1511.81 --> 1517.53
guy that's too afraid to come but it is

1514.99 --> 1517.53
kind of typical

1521.1 --> 1527.35
June 1st really

1524.52 --> 1529.8899999999999
it's like two months more than two

1527.35 --> 1529.8899999999999
months oh

1530.73 --> 1538.29
really need to lock down for two months

1533.44 --> 1538.29
like the entire spring time there

1542.179 --> 1549.529
talk about population control man

1546.369 --> 1552.039
everybody's supposed to be sitting not

1549.529 --> 1554.469
going to public places

1552.039 --> 1557.419
that's gonna have some serious

1554.469 --> 1560.5990000000002
population growth repercussions in this

1557.419 --> 1564.1390000000001
well yeah you know families they already

1560.599 --> 1566.509
are married and all that yeah they may

1564.139 --> 1569.389
get children the Owen Benjamin mentioned

1566.509 --> 1572.329
is like yeah the corona babies there may

1569.389 --> 1575.1689999999999
be a little Corona boom because of all

1572.329 --> 1578.899
the people that are just at home and

1575.169 --> 1580.279
their families and yeah they may they

1578.899 --> 1582.589
have all this time on their hands and

1580.279 --> 1583.779
yeah they might just go and get it make

1582.589 --> 1586.789
a kid

1583.779 --> 1589.509
but yeah for the people that really

1586.789 --> 1591.829
don't have relations or

1589.509 --> 1594.259
yeah that don't have relations they

1591.829 --> 1599.289
maybe they're all like don't have the

1594.259 --> 1599.289
opportunity to meet people how so yeah

1604.999 --> 1610.83
drops and worse

1608.26 --> 1613.68
and that's just

1610.83 --> 1616.09
it's two ways

1613.68 --> 1617.98
people that have families in our set

1616.09 --> 1620.37
there probably have gonna have corona

1617.98 --> 1620.3700000000001
babies

1620.49 --> 1626.65
right it's like like a Boomer baby

1623.8 --> 1630.3999999999999
boomer but in this case induced by this

1626.65 --> 1633.19
Karuna lockdown but yeah the people that

1630.4 --> 1635.02
don't yeah they're all just stuck and

1633.19 --> 1637.21
they're what they're gonna miss out the

1635.02 --> 1642.72
entire spring season when all the

1637.21 --> 1642.72
hormones are at their peaks man that's

1646.74 --> 1651.61
that's going to have a

1649.02 --> 1654.3899999999999
significant measurable influence I can

1651.61 --> 1657.6599999999999
tell you that didn't even

1654.39 --> 1660.0700000000002
in heavily cocked regions

1657.66 --> 1662.19
it's going to be measurable it's going

1660.07 --> 1665.4299999999998
to be statistical it's going to be a gap

1662.19 --> 1665.43
that you

1676.77 --> 1682.01
yeah if you trap everyone in their homes

1679.29 --> 1684.54
and non-stop talk about a pen amping

1682.01 --> 1686.61
people will develop psychosomatic

1684.54 --> 1691.19
symptoms and some people will think

1686.61 --> 1694.1899999999998
they're sick even when they are yep

1691.19 --> 1694.19
definitely

1696.23 --> 1701.24
and I don't know if it gets bad enough

1701.45 --> 1707.27
then these people might even be tricked

1704.46 --> 1710.42
into doing something extremely stupid

1707.27 --> 1714.71
like take a vaccine for that

1710.42 --> 1714.71
it's going to be devastating

1718.8 --> 1725.57
or like I don't know

1722.27 --> 1729.81
it's either debt or

1725.57 --> 1733.05
well they might even get all hyped up

1729.81 --> 1734.45
against Korona deniers or something that

1733.05 --> 1736.07
sounds completely

1734.45 --> 1739.79
ridiculous

1736.07 --> 1742.26
but they might like do that I

1739.79 --> 1744.0
don't know maybe they'll pile it up with

1742.26 --> 1746.19
everything else and then just go into

1744.0 --> 1750.33
fifth full civil war mode all of a

1746.19 --> 1753.39
sudden then they might heap up like they

1750.33 --> 1756.35
will call everyone Nazis Corona deniers

1753.39 --> 1756.3500000000001
anti-semitism

1756.96 --> 1762.8
they'll just shove it up to one

1759.11 --> 1766.74
monolithic opposition pile and start

1762.8 --> 1769.53
just trying to take people down on the

1766.74 --> 1772.44
internet even worse that kind of [Â __Â ] I

1769.53 --> 1776.06
don't know it could go all kinds of

1772.44 --> 1778.53
directions it all depends really on

1776.06 --> 1780.45
how far people are gonna allow

1778.53 --> 1783.29
themselves to spiral out of control over

1780.45 --> 1783.29
this fear porn

1783.32 --> 1787.6799999999998
and

1784.85 --> 1790.5
I'm embarrassed to say that yeah I've

1787.68 --> 1795.39
been going around yesterday several

1790.5 --> 1799.5
stores just to get basic items and it

1795.39 --> 1803.0
was just ridiculous what they've done it

1799.5 --> 1803.0
was absolutely the most

1805.61 --> 1809.4799999999998
ridiculous is supposed to be a corona

1808.5 --> 1812.36
measure

1809.48 --> 1816.06
now it was like

1812.36 --> 1818.58
almost like a school project thing like

1816.06 --> 1821.76
school students just like oh you have to

1818.58 --> 1825.6
make something in the coronavirus theme

1821.76 --> 1827.58
here are the subjects and they just

1825.6 --> 1831.99
fooled around with something that didn't

1827.58 --> 1834.72
make no damn sense at all it was like

1831.99 --> 1838.2
the silliest thing ever I'll try to

1834.72 --> 1842.13
explain it and their world there were

1838.2 --> 1845.57
neuron it will are real it will they

1842.13 --> 1849.92
were all young people in the store

1845.57 --> 1851.99
I say 30 years old max so that make ein

1849.92 --> 1856.76
dove explain let's do how that came to

1851.99 --> 1858.71
be but it was just it wasn't an organic

1856.76 --> 1860.18
sir it was like a regular item store and

1858.71 --> 1861.82
where you can get all kinds of things

1860.18 --> 1863.89
and and

1861.82 --> 1866.59
they

1863.89 --> 1869.5700000000002
made a

1866.59 --> 1872.75
like a railroad system out of their

1869.57 --> 1875.24
store it was so weird it felt like I was

1872.75 --> 1877.24
getting into a Luna Park I don't know if

1875.24 --> 1881.21
everybody knows what that is

1877.24 --> 1884.21
the Luna Park I I used to remember them

1881.21 --> 1886.69
as a kid it's like a weird place where

1884.21 --> 1890.21
you just go around and there's just

1886.69 --> 1893.3300000000002
everything moves there's like staircases

1890.21 --> 1894.92
automated staircases and bridges that

1893.33 --> 1897.9199999999998
move around and it's kind of like a

1894.92 --> 1899.6000000000001
weird moving obstacle course I don't

1897.92 --> 1900.98
know maybe they have now been all closed

1899.6 --> 1902.36
down because they're too dangerous or

1900.98 --> 1905.9
something but I used to find them

1902.36 --> 1907.49
extremely exciting but this kind of day

1905.9 --> 1909.98
it was almost like the store had been

1907.49 --> 1913.48
turned into that because instead of it

1909.98 --> 1917.8700000000001
just being a store with the aisles and

1913.48 --> 1920.0
they closed off where you could go and

1917.87 --> 1923.6899999999998
they turned the entire thing into almost

1920.0 --> 1925.94
like a maze a one path maze and they

1923.69 --> 1927.53
closed the hall you couldn't like all

1925.94 --> 1928.8500000000001
right I want to get this item no you're

1927.53 --> 1934.0
not allowed to go there you have to walk

1928.85 --> 1937.3
all the way do you it's like what really

1934.0 --> 1941.62
how why

1937.3 --> 1944.29
it was so ridiculous so ridiculous and

1941.62 --> 1948.4399999999998
all like

1944.29 --> 1950.57
tape lines on the ground like for

1948.44 --> 1952.4
distancing but also like arrows you'll

1950.57 --> 1955.6
have to go this way like they turn

1952.4 --> 1957.3400000000001
everybody into like this weird

1955.6 --> 1961.6399999999999
ground-based

1957.34 --> 1965.1799999999998
traffic sign robots like they were

1961.64 --> 1967.88
trying to do that and yeah and yeah that

1965.18 --> 1971.03
was pretty bad now others like the

1967.88 --> 1972.74
coffee shop even and also up created

1971.03 --> 1975.6499999999999
their measures apparently they're all

1972.74 --> 1977.44
afraid it seems that if they don't do it

1975.65 --> 1980.8000000000002
right that the police will come

1977.44 --> 1984.7
but I wonder really if if that is real

1980.8 --> 1986.44
or if they are just trying to go a lot

1984.7 --> 1988.54
of to get along it's like yeah we can up

1986.44 --> 1991.06
the game and it's just as long as it

1988.54 --> 1993.85
seems like you're making it it's so odd

1991.06 --> 1995.1
to go out in the world right now and

1993.85 --> 1997.6299999999999
just see

1995.1 --> 2001.3999999999999
what all these stars are going through

1997.63 --> 2002.99
it is very surreal to me

2001.4 --> 2006.18
and

2002.99 --> 2008.43
it's ridiculous it feels like the entire

2006.18 --> 2011.46
place has been turned into a circus it's

2008.43 --> 2014.0600000000002
like the corona circus and every store

2011.46 --> 2018.93
has become their own attraction

2014.06 --> 2023.04
it's it's ridiculous and it's not gonna

2018.93 --> 2024.96
help at all like absolutely not now it's

2023.04 --> 2028.1299999999999
only gonna get people more hyped up

2024.96 --> 2028.13
about the freakin corona

2029.48 --> 2034.44
this is I

2031.85 --> 2036.9299999999998
don't know I got a bad feeling about all

2034.44 --> 2040.88
this not because of but because of the

2036.93 --> 2043.74
heaviness of the mind-controlling

2040.88 --> 2047.7800000000002
politicians and the media just turned

2043.74 --> 2049.82
the people into a circus

2047.78 --> 2052.1
really quickly

2049.82 --> 2055.9500000000003
really quickly

2052.1 --> 2058.97
shocking how everybody just falls in

2055.95 --> 2062.1
line and starts to play the next game

2058.97 --> 2065.25
kind of as ordered it's it's kind of

2062.1 --> 2068.54
unnerving when you think about how how

2065.25 --> 2068.54
smoothly that happen

2071.03 --> 2074.23
it worries me

2075.98 --> 2082.07
like you could just see this is like

2079.159 --> 2084.109
okay it's test a loyalty even though the

2082.07 --> 2085.21
top there are some grapplers obviously

2084.109 --> 2090.29
in control

2085.21 --> 2093.76
but is it will it stop or will they just

2090.29 --> 2093.7599999999998
keep on pushing until

2093.909 --> 2097.7200000000003
until something breaks

2099.07 --> 2104.6600000000003
until it like inter just like no no no

2102.56 --> 2108.71
it just does them that no further

2104.66 --> 2110.93
updates no no you can oh you can't phone

2108.71 --> 2114.59
us anymore uh yeah all the doors are

2110.93 --> 2117.3799999999997
closed now you know there's you can't

2114.59 --> 2119.119
get in what you try to get in Oh guess

2117.38 --> 2120.8900000000003
what it turns out all the doors have

2119.119 --> 2124.01
been reinforced you know you really

2120.89 --> 2127.24
can't get in maybe it'll go that crazy I

2124.01 --> 2131.59
don't know man I really don't know it's

2127.24 --> 2131.5899999999997
it all depends I guess it

2142.43 --> 2148.52
there is no test right we all hear about

2146.029 --> 2151.539
the supposed corona tests every single

2148.52 --> 2151.5389999999998
time but

2152.23 --> 2158.349
doesn't that just mean really the

2156.5 --> 2162.049
preliminary test

2158.349 --> 2165.02
like if you can spot if it is of the

2162.049 --> 2168.44
Koran of Orion because as far as I have

2165.02 --> 2171.7889999999998
heard it takes a long time to process

2168.44 --> 2175.2200000000003
that the details and the

2171.789 --> 2177.7400000000002
the proteins and all that in order to

2175.22 --> 2182.18
establish if it really is that cough at

2177.74 --> 2183.22
19 it takes weeks as far as I know maybe

2182.18 --> 2185.2
longer

2183.22 --> 2188.5989999999997
so

2185.2 --> 2191.359
yeah who is actually been confirmed to

2188.599 --> 2193.039
really have that you know or is it just

2191.359 --> 2194.839
like oh we're testing you on corona and

2193.039 --> 2197.4500000000003
it's like oh you know you could have

2194.839 --> 2200.5099999999998
corona and people just here you have

2197.45 --> 2202.819
corona you know and there's like oh my

2200.51 --> 2204.71
god of corona now I can hype on about

2202.819 --> 2206.92
that just like everybody else in the

2204.71 --> 2210.309
news I can actually get attention on it

2206.92 --> 2210.309
you know it's

2213.22 --> 2221.24
it's almost like in the situation people

2216.95 --> 2225.5789999999997
are are just showing how desperate

2221.24 --> 2229.029
everyone has become for attention how

2225.579 --> 2232.1600000000003
how dumb they let themselves become

2229.029 --> 2234.589
just that they're more out for attention

2232.16 --> 2237.0099999999998
seeking then actually figuring out what

2234.589 --> 2237.0099999999998
is real

2252.82 --> 2260.05
yeah yeah that's yeah indeed Irene Effy

2257.05 --> 2265.15
that's the thing yeah if you're gonna do

2260.05 --> 2267.7000000000003
a specific protein type test on a sample

2265.15 --> 2270.9700000000003
to check her onna well guess what yeah

2267.7 --> 2274.27
that's very easy to just double that on

2270.97 --> 2277.39
a genetic test on the person yeah that's

2274.27 --> 2280.57
true absolutely it's roughly the same

2277.39 --> 2282.54
process just take the sample split it up

2280.57 --> 2286.0
into and you're done

2282.54 --> 2288.67
you can use usen't for two different

2286.0 --> 2291.76
things including just genetic testing of

2288.67 --> 2294.01
the person although I don't know if

2291.76 --> 2296.19
they're allowed to do that unless you

2294.01 --> 2299.26
like sign a waiver for it

2296.19 --> 2302.04
you know I I don't even know how that's

2299.26 --> 2305.44
gonna work once they

2302.04 --> 2307.09
or how it has work I don't have people

2305.44 --> 2309.16
that have supposedly been tested on

2307.09 --> 2311.01
quran have they did they have to sign it

2309.16 --> 2314.1099999999997
like a paper

2311.01 --> 2317.86
did they actually read the details

2314.11 --> 2317.86
[Laughter]

2320.82 --> 2327.1200000000003
because I don't think they can just like

2324.18 --> 2329.49
that take anything although yeah maybe

2327.12 --> 2331.8199999999997
martial law situation does allow for it

2329.49 --> 2334.52
can get complex

2331.82 --> 2338.1800000000003
in the United States perhaps

2334.52 --> 2342.74
or Canada one was it places

2338.18 --> 2342.74
in the Netherlands that I think so

2359.87 --> 2364.72
yeah IRA Neffe well the first test kits

2362.57 --> 2367.34
they just

2364.72 --> 2371.0899999999997
look how it's even supposed to work

2367.34 --> 2374.7200000000003
right having virus elements in your body

2371.09 --> 2377.75
does not give you the disease officially

2374.72 --> 2380.7799999999997
okay it's kind of telling now you have

2377.75 --> 2383.06
to have a certain percentage of them in

2380.78 --> 2384.8300000000004
a certain amount of blood or whatever

2383.06 --> 2387.38
you're testing it's about the

2384.83 --> 2391.52
percentages so yeah if you're going to

2387.38 --> 2393.61
do quick tests yeah they may be off of

2391.52 --> 2396.61
course they can be off

2393.61 --> 2396.61
that's

2411.4 --> 2414.57
[Music]

2421.46 --> 2424.76
right I

2428.78 --> 2435.11
need a lawyer to figure out all the

2431.25 --> 2438.21
medical forms well you know what

2435.11 --> 2440.46
maybe that if this keeps up you know if

2438.21 --> 2442.55
the medical industrial complex keeps up

2440.46 --> 2447.12
these grappler games as it were

2442.55 --> 2449.4
then maybe medical lawyers will become a

2447.12 --> 2452.25
thing it's like oh you're gonna engage

2449.4 --> 2453.81
in the medical industry because you have

2452.25 --> 2455.28
to yeah you have in this serious

2453.81 --> 2457.17
threatening situation that you only what

2455.28 --> 2459.96
I can do about it or you need a lawyer

2457.17 --> 2462.2400000000002
to be there in order to make sure that

2459.96 --> 2465.26
you don't accidentally sign anyway your

2462.24 --> 2468.0899999999997
life pretty much that kind of thing so

2465.26 --> 2471.9
maybe medical lawyers will become a

2468.09 --> 2476.51
thing could be like ex doctors that

2471.9 --> 2476.51
become lawyers or I don't know

2477.5 --> 2484.62
it just sounds kind of science fictiony

2480.9 --> 2486.6
but that could become a thing maybe

2484.62 --> 2488.2799999999997
they're already there it's just that

2486.6 --> 2490.67
nobody talks about him except really

2488.28 --> 2492.7200000000003
rich people I don't know man

2490.67 --> 2494.13
alright I guess that if you're really

2492.72 --> 2495.87
really rich you're just gonna have a

2494.13 --> 2498.38
pile of lawyers it doesn't really matter

2495.87 --> 2498.38
if they're

2498.77 --> 2507.11
gonna be for one specific type of thing

2502.89 --> 2511.3399999999997
medical issues you know anyway

2507.11 --> 2511.34
just I'm being silly

2522.02 --> 2525.2
well misery Barrett yeah it's only

2524.309 --> 2527.88
natural

2525.2 --> 2529.5
it's not just almost depressing to be

2527.88 --> 2532.19
higher minded it is depressing to be

2529.5 --> 2534.63
higher minded that's because

2532.19 --> 2536.849
when you're higher minded you see

2534.63 --> 2540.26
sharper you see the consequences more

2536.849 --> 2543.77
and you see more how the darkness is

2540.26 --> 2547.53
inevitable and therefore how

2543.77 --> 2550.2
things fade or so you see more of the

2547.53 --> 2551.8190000000004
grim sides of reality now you can't

2550.2 --> 2554.839
really get away from it and that's very

2551.819 --> 2557.0589999999997
depressing but at the same time

2554.839 --> 2561.45
you also

2557.059 --> 2563.76
if you keep on focusing on the logos and

2561.45 --> 2567.839
all that and the flame of honor you can

2563.76 --> 2568.6400000000003
also kind of see things coming and try

2567.839 --> 2570.8289999999997
to

2568.64 --> 2575.549
work towards

2570.829 --> 2576.8590000000004
saving that safe keeping it or upgrading

2575.549 --> 2579.599
it as it were

2576.859 --> 2583.819
giving it extra energy to make sure it

2579.599 --> 2583.819
doesn't fall to it it maintains itself

2585.89 --> 2590.029
that sounds all very ethereal

2592.12 --> 2598.17
so yeah you do get some gems but there's

2595.0 --> 2598.17
also a lot of darkness

2608.0 --> 2611.15
[Music]

2647.18 --> 2649.21
ah

2650.89 --> 2656.27
good to see that Nathan's put out the

2654.02 --> 2658.16
link to the show already so there will

2656.27 --> 2660.22
definitely be a flat earth debates this

2658.16 --> 2663.22
time

2660.22 --> 2663.22
good

2668.8 --> 2671.8
right

2708.22 --> 2714.3689999999997
yeah through me kind of off to Missouri

2710.829 --> 2716.23
bear it was really odd and I rounded the

2714.369 --> 2717.299
show out like yeah I'm gonna join right

2716.23 --> 2720.549
now and

2717.299 --> 2722.579
so that was kind of weird that just

2720.549 --> 2725.579
nothing

2722.579 --> 2725.579
yeah

2726.18 --> 2732.39
I'm pretty sure we're gonna hear exactly

2728.65 --> 2735.96
why you didn't show up

2732.39 --> 2735.96
but yeah

2743.71 --> 2749.7400000000002
and the nut milks you've been watching

2770.079 --> 2775.3
and I'm really

2772.63 --> 2780.9100000000003
forgetful today man

2775.3 --> 2780.9100000000003
just keep on forgetting names and

2796.92 --> 2802.21
YouTube's not exactly making it easy to

2799.99 --> 2805.8999999999996
find for me oh yeah quantum of conscious

2802.21 --> 2809.43
down just right you've been watching

2805.9 --> 2814.32
that that's it is a

2809.43 --> 2814.3199999999997
description of the controllers

2834.709 --> 2839.39
right okay yeah

2845.359 --> 2848.359
yeah

2863.7 --> 2870.29
dark forces controlling the zombies

2866.9 --> 2870.29
in charge

2872.8 --> 2878.9700000000003
well or maybe it's just a program and it

2876.04 --> 2878.97
just works

2879.57 --> 2886.32
in a predictable manner and that's why

2882.7 --> 2886.3199999999997
it's being applied I

2888.21 --> 2892.54
sometimes wonder if they're not just

2890.92 --> 2894.55
literally getting papers with

2892.54 --> 2897.96
instructions telling them that the

2894.55 --> 2897.96
themes and what they gotta address

2901.53 --> 2904.77
but maybe

2906.78 --> 2911.53
maybe they part of it they literally

2909.7 --> 2913.62
just make up as they go along I don't

2911.53 --> 2913.6200000000003
know

2934.52 --> 2940.3
well yeah misery bear it was it was his

2937.04 --> 2940.3
tactic to do that I

2946.39 --> 2954.29
just like to generally avoid

2950.44 --> 2955.57
that as much that's specifically as much

2954.29 --> 2960.52
as I can

2955.57 --> 2960.52
because just give me a creeps

2980.07 --> 2983.179
[Music]

2994.17 --> 2998.76
that's interesting

2996.66 --> 3001.2599999999998
but not

2998.76 --> 3004.19
mr. cried they noted these are other

3001.26 --> 3007.4700000000003
types of crows there so

3004.19 --> 3011.78
you seem to be having a benefit meal

3007.47 --> 3014.0299999999997
meal and on meal brawl oh

3011.78 --> 3018.5600000000004
okay

3014.03 --> 3018.5600000000004
so they're kind of bickering about that

3019.91 --> 3024.7999999999997
they apparently don't like being filmed

3030.82 --> 3037.28
yeah they were just bickering I could

3035.0 --> 3040.21
see it like on them like the way they

3037.28 --> 3040.21
compose themselves

3040.359 --> 3047.69
like stop getting so close to my female

3044.53 --> 3049.3390000000004
no it's not Magpies there is a magpie

3047.69 --> 3050.78
over there but that's not the one that

3049.339 --> 3053.68
we're making the noise that were the

3050.78 --> 3053.6800000000003
little black ones

3054.099 --> 3058.599
yeah Magpies are watching

3060.13 --> 3063.289
[Music]

3092.24 --> 3096.8199999999997
hmmm trying to find the right word for

3095.03 --> 3100.0400000000004
it

3096.82 --> 3102.82
okay I think it might be called a

3100.04 --> 3102.82
jackdaw

3104.47 --> 3109.3799999999997
could that be right

3106.25 --> 3109.38
[Music]

3109.839 --> 3114.22
those jackdaws

3132.44 --> 3138.859
alright I'll check dusk and if they are

3135.63 --> 3141.839
if that is really what they're called

3138.859 --> 3143.759
they sometimes come in very big flocks

3141.839 --> 3145.94
and then they can can make a lot of

3143.759 --> 3145.94
noise

3146.539 --> 3150.599
but I don't know most of the time

3148.619 --> 3153.329
they're just really kind of quiet and

3150.599 --> 3156.739
peaceful until they got rowdy with one

3153.329 --> 3156.739
other and then they get very noisy

3158.02 --> 3161.13
[Music]

3167.18 --> 3170.18
yeah

3171.71 --> 3180.01
just don't get too over enthusiastic

3176.0 --> 3180.01
about that wait 60 or m/c

3186.55 --> 3189.699
[Music]

3192.84 --> 3199.349
[Music]

3194.999 --> 3199.3489999999997
or the Magpies crying for attention

3209.45 --> 3217.8489999999997
yeah there jackdaws definitely

3214.13 --> 3217.849
watching it the picture

3227.16 --> 3233.21
right

3228.59 --> 3233.21
yeah that's exactly what they are

3256.15 --> 3262.119
Ravens you say

3259.119 --> 3262.119
okay

3266.66 --> 3273.019
I've never seen ya there's no Ravens

3268.819 --> 3275.619
over here they are set to also hang

3273.019 --> 3279.5589999999997
around in France

3275.619 --> 3281.259
but yeah not in the Netherlands I think

3279.559 --> 3284.8900000000003
it's too cold here

3281.259 --> 3284.89
too much City

3316.319 --> 3322.799
well is it a gym what's up with the caps

3319.66 --> 3322.799
stop it

3325.799 --> 3331.349
drop each other's eggs really jacked us

3328.93 --> 3331.3489999999997
do that

3333.299 --> 3338.7
hmm no I I don't know oh

3341.46 --> 3348.9900000000002
well a GM technically I don't give a

3345.069 --> 3352.0299999999997
[Â __Â ] you know they are birds

3348.99 --> 3355.1499999999996
they're animals if they do that that

3352.03 --> 3357.94
does not make them the devil a GM they

3355.15 --> 3361.0
are just Birds if that is what they do

3357.94 --> 3363.089
then that is what they do I still like

3361.0 --> 3365.95
them mm-hmm

3363.089 --> 3369.869
because they're just interesting birds

3365.95 --> 3374.29
you know Magpies are kind of bastards to

3369.869 --> 3378.13
their Birds I like them so I don't give

3374.29 --> 3380.349
a [Â __Â ] if they have like Bible forbidden

3378.13 --> 3382.7400000000002
behaviors or whatever they're freaking

3380.349 --> 3382.7400000000002
Birds

3394.23 --> 3404.67
[Music]

3400.29 --> 3404.67
why would you bring that up it's just

3411.21 --> 3417.19
well if they do it the only good reason

3415.54 --> 3419.44
I could think of it is that they're

3417.19 --> 3422.4900000000002
really competitive and probably pretty

3419.44 --> 3426.73
fertile because

3422.49 --> 3429.54
if actual procreation in the in the

3426.73 --> 3432.04
masses are a danger

3429.54 --> 3436.349
then increase yeah if they do that it'll

3432.04 --> 3436.349
be over very quickly for them so

3451.67 --> 3460.11
huh I run Effy yeah that's nice I do it

3456.18 --> 3462.48
too I leave I yeah I use filtered water

3460.11 --> 3465.8900000000003
in a bowl that I put down there and they

3462.48 --> 3469.7400000000002
sometimes bathe in it and sometimes they

3465.89 --> 3472.4
drink from it and I give like my old

3469.74 --> 3476.3399999999997
bread bread organic bread and remnants

3472.4 --> 3479.01
and they really love it I get times day

3476.34 --> 3482.61
they almost like get really rough over

3479.01 --> 3484.7900000000004
it and does all the yeah and there's

3482.61 --> 3490.29
many different times I like it

3484.79 --> 3493.08
and yeah the crows they even like make

3490.29 --> 3494.34
soup out of it so when they figured out

3493.08 --> 3497.0099999999998
that there's bread there they're just

3494.34 --> 3499.2200000000003
gonna take pieces of bread walk over to

3497.01 --> 3502.26
the water bowl put it in

3499.22 --> 3504.08
move it around a little let it soak up

3502.26 --> 3507.3500000000004
the water and then they eat it

3504.08 --> 3507.35
it's funny

3508.16 --> 3514.73
like crows are pretty creative and picky

3511.68 --> 3514.73
when it comes to their food

3520.48 --> 3525.76
they like to utilizes their surroundings

3523.49 --> 3525.7599999999998
a lot

3528.31 --> 3535.16
right yeah talking about birds well I

3533.51 --> 3537.7900000000004
did talk about flattered at the little

3535.16 --> 3537.79
so

3538.09 --> 3542.3500000000004
nobody needs to be complaining

3553.349 --> 3557.2690000000002
what are you talking about

3557.89 --> 3565.5989999999997
it's all this revenge fantasy

3561.97 --> 3565.5989999999997
basics erm see

3567.01 --> 3574.76
it's like why are you

3571.18 --> 3576.319
being like I'm gonna destroy them they

3574.76 --> 3579.6090000000004
need to play they need all these

3576.319 --> 3582.98
horrible things I'm just gonna

3579.609 --> 3585.38
fantasize all day long about how they're

3582.98 --> 3588.309
gonna just have this horrific Elend or

3585.38 --> 3592.2200000000003
whatever it is dude

3588.309 --> 3594.4300000000003
like I get that we need things under

3592.22 --> 3596.6189999999997
control right

3594.43 --> 3600.3089999999997
but why

3596.619 --> 3603.049
get like that I'd I

3600.309 --> 3605.829
think you're just gonna burn yourself up

3603.049 --> 3605.829
you know

3606.94 --> 3613.359
in a way I'd say just look at Alex Jones

3609.91 --> 3617.93
like he does that [Â __Â ] all the time I

3613.359 --> 3621.17
think that's that's healthy for him yes

3617.93 --> 3624.6499999999996
times it is like it's very his thing he

3621.17 --> 3627.049
made it his thing and it is entertaining

3624.65 --> 3630.4100000000003
at times and it's also like called for

3627.049 --> 3633.92
at times like just a cry of passion type

3630.41 --> 3636.71
of thing but to constantly do that to

3633.92 --> 3638.779
get obsessed you become a devil

3636.71 --> 3641.27
persecutor I try to warn people about

3638.779 --> 3645.26
this because it's a risk for all

3641.27 --> 3648.38
Christians or people that try to fall in

3645.26 --> 3651.73
the past try to do good if you get

3648.38 --> 3656.48
obsessed over the people that are evil

3651.73 --> 3660.339
then you lose track of what's good your

3656.48 --> 3663.22
focus is laid from

3660.339 --> 3665.38
your life and a

3663.22 --> 3669.0099999999998
way to

3665.38 --> 3672.109
to the the dark ones that way

3669.01 --> 3676.0
it's not effective you're basically

3672.109 --> 3676.0
handing them their power your power

3677.95 --> 3683.8999999999996
so it's good to give recognition at

3680.869 --> 3687.819
times but try not to get obsessed over

3683.9 --> 3687.819
it it's just not productive

3695.34 --> 3702.46
my personal strategy in approaching all

3698.65 --> 3705.36
of them it's always been look they're

3702.46 --> 3705.36
just insane

3705.63 --> 3713.29
really they if they seem like they

3711.4 --> 3715.69
really know what they're doing it's

3713.29 --> 3718.09
because they've become quite eloquent

3715.69 --> 3719.86
into presenting an image that is

3718.09 --> 3721.48
convincing enough for people to believe

3719.86 --> 3722.3700000000003
that they actually know what they're

3721.48 --> 3726.37
doing

3722.37 --> 3728.47
because they probably don't really not

3726.37 --> 3730.93
as much as everybody would like to

3728.47 --> 3734.14
imagine that they do it's part of their

3730.93 --> 3736.0899999999997
the spell to kind of keep them in their

3734.14 --> 3739.21
position so it's all a matter of

3736.09 --> 3743.55
basically waking everything up and then

3739.21 --> 3743.55
just letting it get sweat out

3744.09 --> 3749.55
you know

3747.15 --> 3753.31
don't get all

3749.55 --> 3754.9500000000003
aggressive don't start attacking no just

3753.31 --> 3758.31
let it

3754.95 --> 3758.31
fever out

3758.46 --> 3763.26
ascend above it and let it all just

3763.62 --> 3769.89
be carried away gradually slowly by the

3767.8 --> 3772.05
system and

3769.89 --> 3776.25
the people

3772.05 --> 3776.25
until it becomes harmless I

3777.66 --> 3782.8599999999997
don't know but yeah that sounds really

3780.37 --> 3784.65
really softy in retrospect to the people

3782.86 --> 3788.23
we're actually talking about of course

3784.65 --> 3790.71
but it's it's a method of approach and I

3788.23 --> 3794.68
think for me personally a

3790.71 --> 3798.2200000000003
the method the path at it is more

3794.68 --> 3800.71
important than stopping a specific

3798.22 --> 3802.29
individual no matter how important they

3800.71 --> 3805.56
seem

3802.29 --> 3805.56
you see

3815.66 --> 3822.8399999999997
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3819.47 --> 3824.9399999999996
so thanks everyone for coming I hope you

3822.84 --> 3828.86

3824.94 --> 3828.86

3834.27 --> 3839.82

3836.85 --> 3843.15
really late so that is that yeah I just

went to bed a bit late not too late but

3843.15 --> 3850.8
still later and that yeah a little bit

3846.18 --> 3853.08
of a lash back but I'll get over it if
