me seven watching

186.78 --> 191.55
[Music]

195.92 --> 200.83999999999997
oh oh but it seems that I'm competing

198.68 --> 204.08
with

200.84 --> 207.08
fed it didn't give

204.08 --> 207.08
it

207.599 --> 214.23899999999998
what oh it didn't show that

211.08 --> 219.04000000000002
earlier that's weird notification wasn't

214.239 --> 222.56
there first from Nathan that's

219.04 --> 225.04
[Music]

222.56 --> 227.36
weird right but yeah apparently I'm

225.04 --> 230.76
competing with fed now and yeah we'll

227.36 --> 230.76000000000002
see who's going to show up if

231.5 --> 236.379
[Music]

237.64 --> 241.67999999999998
anybody we'll see

259.1 --> 265.019
[Music]

268.6 --> 271.6
yeah

284.479 --> 290.639
weirdly enough my show

287.36 --> 293.16
yesterday didn't get as many

290.639 --> 296.32
views so even though the live

293.16 --> 298.759
participation might have been decent

296.32 --> 301.12
they didn't get even that many views

298.759 --> 302.88
which is just strange is it because it's

301.12 --> 306.479
not 3

302.88 --> 306.479
hours it's so

318.08 --> 322.88
odd I don't get

320.12 --> 324.08
it why that's happening but I mean yeah

322.88 --> 328.36
the

324.08 --> 328.35999999999996
views who can figure it out

328.479 --> 331.479
right

333.08 --> 335.52
all right

338.1 --> 343.08000000000004
[Music]

345.84 --> 352.0
anyway yeah in the recent few days just

350.12 --> 354.36
over at Infowars things have been kind

352.0 --> 358.52
of interesting

354.36 --> 360.24
because Alex keeps getting like doing

358.52 --> 364.84
these

360.24 --> 367.8
uh spaces on X hangs it's almost like

364.84 --> 370.71999999999997
the Google days except on X it really

367.8 --> 373.12
kind of feels like that what they are

370.72 --> 377.03900000000004
doing and

373.12 --> 379.44
hey yeah also I joined the panel of

377.039 --> 381.71999999999997
Shiva by accident one time that was kind

379.44 --> 382.8
of weird I just wanted to see hey what's

381.72 --> 386.28000000000003
going on there and then it was like

382.8 --> 388.40000000000003
there like oh oh uh I how do I put

386.28 --> 391.039
myself on mute

388.4 --> 394.96
[ __ ] get out of here just I didn't even

391.039 --> 394.96
mean to join that but it's

396.8 --> 401.28000000000003
interesting maybe one day I'm going to

398.88 --> 403.639
prepare myself to actually

401.28 --> 407.19899999999996
like join

403.639 --> 409.8
Alex with what he's doing there so he

407.199 --> 412.72
get Elon Musk keeps getting back on with

409.8 --> 414.8
him in there and he's like having this

412.72 --> 417.24
three-way

414.8 --> 420.84000000000003
discussions with like his prominent

417.24 --> 423.199
guests and everything and it's it is

420.84 --> 423.19899999999996
really

424.639 --> 433.36
interesting it's like a

427.44 --> 437.68
new bit of chemistry going on so

433.36 --> 439.759
yeah yeah g Edward Gren on which is an

437.68 --> 442.639
interesting person I think I met him in

439.759 --> 444.599
person as well around that same time

442.639 --> 447.84000000000003
that I met David

444.599 --> 447.84
Ike not

448.319 --> 451.319
sure

453.24 --> 459.44
but I do remember like actually talking

455.52 --> 462.15999999999997
to him face to face very short I mean

459.44 --> 466.36
that guy does

462.16 --> 468.68
not like he's just very busy in his head

466.36 --> 471.44
so a lot of the times like when he's not

468.68 --> 474.68
interested he just won't listen at

471.44 --> 474.68
all it's

474.759 --> 480.40000000000003
weird but uh yeah that happened

478.12 --> 482.96
yesterday and

480.4 --> 484.44
maybe today somebody can pop in the chat

482.96 --> 487.31899999999996
and just say

484.44 --> 490.84
hello especially if you got a

487.319 --> 490.84000000000003
wrench that would be

502.23 --> 507.139
[Music]

508.24 --> 511.24
great

519.919 --> 527.56
ah clutch hey first in chat good to see

524.44 --> 528.3800000000001
you Mr Arwin you don't don't call me

527.56 --> 532.6199999999999
that that's

528.38 --> 532.62
[Music]

534.04 --> 537.36
weird how you

538.2 --> 543.8000000000001

543.8 --> 548.519
or

545.519 --> 548.519
Queens

551.519 --> 556.92
Queen cuz I miss those

554.56 --> 560.279
streams maybe it's just not the right

556.92 --> 562.11
time still got some issues to work

560.279 --> 564.68
out but

562.11 --> 567.2
[Music]

564.68 --> 568.12
uh I'm okay think's getting better okay

567.2 --> 571.12
that's

568.12 --> 571.12
great

580.519 --> 584.519
still not entirely sure exactly what it

582.64 --> 585.64
was that was going on but you probably

584.519 --> 589.079
don't want

585.64 --> 591.519
to talk about it publicly but I am just

589.079 --> 594.88
personally curious but I

591.519 --> 598.12
mean if you don't want to like share it

594.88 --> 601.12
with anybody that's fine but I'm just

598.12 --> 601.12
curious

601.839 --> 606.0790000000001
I don't

603.48 --> 607.279
know but at least it's I'm glad to hear

606.079 --> 611.88
you're getting

607.279 --> 611.88
better she bought a new house new job

617.56 --> 623.3599999999999
whoa what how the hell did she just buy

620.16 --> 623.36
a new house and a new

626.68 --> 632.04
job whoa what happened how do you just

631.04 --> 635.24
get

632.04 --> 637.68
to maybe it was like planned a long time

635.24 --> 637.6800000000001
ago or

637.959 --> 645.1199999999999
something okay clutch yeah good to

641.12 --> 645.12
hear maybe on Skype or

653.16 --> 658.079
something right anyhow yeah I'm going to

656.0 --> 661.04
just try to take it easy as much as I

658.079 --> 661.04
can

661.8 --> 666.959
I'm still like in the

663.92 --> 670.16
ancestral winds and all

666.959 --> 675.1999999999999
that and I have to be a little bit more

670.16 --> 675.1999999999999
careful or rather conscious about coffee

676.24 --> 681.639
now so yeah I might have already passed

679.56 --> 683.5189999999999
the peak with that and that it's now

681.639 --> 686.44
going to become a burden on me so I have

683.519 --> 690.9590000000001
to just be very aware about

686.44 --> 690.9590000000001
it and maybe stop doing it

691.76 --> 698.079
again but I mean it has been

694.8 --> 699.68
very pleasurable addictive you could say

698.079 --> 701.519
so like yeah that's going to be a

699.68 --> 704.68
challenge stopping with that again and I

701.519 --> 707.76
knew that when I began with it remember

704.68 --> 711.16
saying that to you guys but hey the

707.76 --> 711.16
random Explorer good to see

715.5 --> 720.88
[Music]

717.959 --> 722.8699999999999
you

720.88 --> 726.23
are you

722.87 --> 726.23
[Music]

726.44 --> 731.32
doing no

728.519 --> 734.76
no don't don't do

731.32 --> 734.7600000000001
that oh

739.199 --> 744.56
God I hate people that

742.04 --> 747.0
have videos on their YouTube channel

744.56 --> 749.92
that automatically start playing when

747.0 --> 752.279
you open their page I really

749.92 --> 755.639
don't like

752.279 --> 757.8
that but yeah whatever that's why I

755.639 --> 759.9590000000001
don't have one because I find it very

757.8 --> 764.7199999999999
annoying to have a front video that

759.959 --> 767.7199999999999
always starts playing when you open the

764.72 --> 767.72
channel

775.56 --> 780.16
H but I guess for some people it is good

778.36 --> 783.16
advertis in to do

780.16 --> 783.16
that

802.079 --> 807.04
H hey slow moon buggy good to see you

805.199 --> 809.56
yeah I saw you over at

807.04 --> 811.8
Fed was wondering

809.56 --> 815.56
maybe you thought that I wouldn't go

811.8 --> 815.56
live at all today but I'm

815.93 --> 822.4399999999999
[Music]

819.72 --> 826.279
here I saw

822.44 --> 828.1990000000001
your your comment about sea Hawkins

826.279 --> 831.04
blowing against a piece of paper and

828.199 --> 833.279
that that proved that you didn't need a

831.04 --> 835.8389999999999
container to have gas pressure did he

833.279 --> 835.8389999999999
really do

836.32 --> 840.3000000000001
that switch back and forth okay that's

838.759 --> 846.799
that's fair

840.3 --> 846.799
[Music]

858.199 --> 864.16
enough it's hilarious is it long if it's

862.04 --> 866.759
if it's really short yeah sure send it

864.16 --> 869.3199999999999
to me I might even like show it for a

866.759 --> 871.88
bit if it's really funny

869.32 --> 873.9200000000001
on the other hand it's Sean Hawkins

871.88 --> 876.399
though so maybe just

873.92 --> 879.04
not yeah Sean ha yeah no that guy's

876.399 --> 879.04
never giving

884.519 --> 890.5600000000001
up that's a guy with a mission but not a

892.36 --> 898.839
point like I refuse to stop I just keep

896.04 --> 901.24
going and but I'm always trying to to

898.839 --> 906.0
find new points and everything Shan

901.24 --> 908.519
keeps going and he just he never has a

906.0 --> 911.079
point it's always something really

908.519 --> 914.24
stupid just to show everybody how stupid

911.079 --> 917.5999999999999
he is and he thinks he's

914.24 --> 922.0
smart it's just

917.6 --> 924.279
[ __ ] Sean wants watches Owen now I

922.0 --> 927.6
thought he thought that was all like

924.279 --> 930.6
sexist and bigoted and all

927.6 --> 930.6
that

932.56 --> 940.7199999999999
oh for dank hey hello he you vote for

936.199 --> 945.079
dank being in life hey maybe if he wants

940.72 --> 947.399
to I don't know I've talked with Dank

945.079 --> 950.5999999999999
over Discord but he seems like a really

947.399 --> 952.78
laidback guy not really a big

950.6 --> 954.519
conversation list

952.78 --> 957.759
[Music]

954.519 --> 959.839
though so like what the hell would we

957.759 --> 964.639
talk about

959.839 --> 968.0
I don't know if dank is really good with

964.639 --> 971.04
that but maybe maybe maybe he has like a

968.0 --> 974.959
lot of questions or something and I'm

971.04 --> 977.7199999999999
always up for that unless it's like is

974.959 --> 980.7589999999999
that a crossbow or

977.72 --> 983.9300000000001
like what type of peanut butter do you

980.759 --> 987.0
like like that sort of nonsense no go

983.93 --> 987.0
[Music]

987.519 --> 991.16
away

989.06 --> 993.92
[Music]

991.16 --> 997.16
maybe if he wanted to he's such a cool

993.92 --> 999.639
guy yes he is no I agreed to that and

997.16 --> 1002.759
he's like supported me for very long

999.639 --> 1002.759
time he's my longest

1005.759 --> 1010.92
supporter and he is a very cool guy and

1008.759 --> 1012.759
he's like good to have around but I mean

1010.92 --> 1014.1899999999999
if we're like going to be on then what

1012.759 --> 1017.0790000000001
are we going to talk

1014.19 --> 1020.0
[Music]

1017.079 --> 1023.959
about so hey hey if he wants to come on

1020.0 --> 1023.959
and do that that would be

1024.4 --> 1032.24
cool or or pretty much anybody else that

1027.52 --> 1032.24
isn't a fulltime anti flat earther

1033.12 --> 1037.799
Ballard cuz I'm not dealing with that

1035.48 --> 1037.799
[ __ ]

1047.4 --> 1050.4
anymore

1054.12 --> 1059.4799999999998
like I'm done sitting trying to like

1057.32 --> 1061.36
waste all my time and energy to have

1059.48 --> 1064.24
high level explanations that are going

1061.36 --> 1064.24
to be rumpus

1066.52 --> 1072.039
through by

1068.64 --> 1074.2800000000002
people that aren't interested in

1072.039 --> 1079.48
figuring out the truth and are just

1074.28 --> 1082.3999999999999
there to like create big tiresome

1079.48 --> 1085.6
puzzles that amount to nothing just to

1082.4 --> 1088.4
stall the opponent like I'm done doing

1085.6 --> 1091.559
that I'm not playing those

1088.4 --> 1095.88
psychological merry go around again with

1091.559 --> 1100.84

1095.88 --> 1102.8400000000001
done like I can ex I yeah I could just

1100.84 --> 1105.12
go meta every time they do that and just

1102.84 --> 1106.9599999999998
immediately explain exactly what's going

1105.12 --> 1108.9189999999999
on and what they're anticipating and

1106.96 --> 1110.6000000000001
what I'm not going to do cuz I'm not

1108.919 --> 1112.159
playing along with that anymore like

1110.6 --> 1114.9599999999998
that's not the way I'm going to

1112.159 --> 1117.3200000000002
meticulously explain things because they

1114.96 --> 1118.24
demand it on the run because they are

1117.32 --> 1121.039
off

1118.24 --> 1124.96
fisca something very

1121.039 --> 1124.96
basic I refuse to do

1127.08 --> 1132.1589999999999
that yeah but yeah dank is not one of

1129.44 --> 1132.159
those guys by the

1132.79 --> 1136.049
[Music]

1137.32 --> 1143.1589999999999
way right but slowmo what did what did

1141.039 --> 1145.919
Sean say that make you think that he

1143.159 --> 1145.919
watches ow

1148.799 --> 1154.69
now

1151.31 --> 1154.69
[Music]

1158.33 --> 1161.57
[Music]

1167.24 --> 1170.24
slow-mo

1177.16 --> 1182.559
[Music]

1178.96 --> 1187.8400000000001
just a feeling yeah but

1182.559 --> 1187.84
how where why what like

1188.6 --> 1193.6399999999999
how what are you know how is he

1190.88 --> 1193.64
resonating with

1197.24 --> 1200.24
it

1202.28 --> 1209.6789999999999
or is he just watching it as a hate

1205.32 --> 1209.6789999999999
watch is he just trolling him

1209.88 --> 1215.44
now cuz I mean Owen has gigantic amounts

1213.44 --> 1218.24
of anti Owen

1215.44 --> 1220.0
trolls maybe sea is like oh maybe I'll

1218.24 --> 1222.88
join those guys

1220.0 --> 1226.84
because there's more

1222.88 --> 1226.8400000000001
energy I won't feel as

1227.159 --> 1231.2800000000002
lonely

1229.52 --> 1234.72
he could be hate watching okay fair

1231.28 --> 1234.72
enough because that could make

1235.159 --> 1240.48
sense Sean is kind of a hate watching

1237.919 --> 1240.48
guy you

1245.32 --> 1250.2
know I'm wondering like with a lot of

1248.0 --> 1253.32
hate Watchers out there if it's just

1250.2 --> 1255.72
hate watching because they're just so

1253.32 --> 1257.6789999999999
frustrated that they don't know how to

1255.72 --> 1259.1200000000001
normally peacefully communicate with

1257.679 --> 1262.799
people anym

1259.12 --> 1262.799
anymore maybe that is

1263.919 --> 1269.919
it maybe they're hate watching because

1266.32 --> 1269.9189999999999
they're just so damn

1271.159 --> 1277.0390000000002
lonely

1274.12 --> 1280.12
right I mean if I had if every place

1277.039 --> 1282.79
that I knew would reject me I'd probably

1280.12 --> 1287.039
start hate watching things

1282.79 --> 1290.039
[Music]

1287.039 --> 1290.039
too

1292.919 --> 1300.24
there's some humor that Owen

1295.48 --> 1300.24
does like what in what

1312.799 --> 1318.24
direction because thus far I from

1316.2 --> 1321.679
everything that I've seen Sean Hawkins

1318.24 --> 1325.159
really seems just like an elderly sjw to

1321.679 --> 1327.96
me so I'm wondering then like what about

1325.159 --> 1332.2
Owen what you

1327.96 --> 1332.2
oh the nigle stuff

1333.159 --> 1336.159
okay

1340.52 --> 1345.4
really

1342.52 --> 1349.96
H why so late today

1345.4 --> 1349.96
because it was late

1350.919 --> 1355.5200000000002
H oh

1352.72 --> 1357.96
yeah okay I didn't know I didn't know it

1355.52 --> 1361.559
was kind of

1357.96 --> 1361.559
a that he had

1366.039 --> 1373.24
that I mean he is kind of getting like a

1369.679 --> 1375.64
beginning to become a skinny frail old

1373.24 --> 1378.32
man and

1375.64 --> 1380.48
yeah when you're like that yeah then

1378.32 --> 1384.279
some of those

1380.48 --> 1387.44
people might be very scary there because

1384.279 --> 1390.2
they do on camera and [ __ ] really

1387.44 --> 1391.919
horrendous things to old people too just

1390.2 --> 1394.96
because they're

1391.919 --> 1398.24
white by their own freaking word so yeah

1394.96 --> 1398.24
maybe maybe that is

1403.279 --> 1410.0
it but I mean yeah Owen really makes it

1408.84 --> 1413.1589999999999
all more

1410.0 --> 1413.159
amicable you

1414.32 --> 1421.2
know when he does all that stuff like it

1418.32 --> 1423.96
makes me feel more

1421.2 --> 1425.799
understanding about like why that like

1423.96 --> 1429.0
what are they doing

1425.799 --> 1431.84
why so maybe he's doing it for that just

1429.0 --> 1431.84
to soothe his

1436.88 --> 1439.88
nerves

1454.0 --> 1461.919
it's a ren fields of the original

1456.64 --> 1461.919
Dracula movie wow harsh but

1464.08 --> 1469.799
fair eight bucks what okay

1471.44 --> 1475.8400000000001
I don't think I've ever actually fully

1473.72 --> 1478.3990000000001
watched the original Dracula

1475.84 --> 1481.84
movie because it seemed kind of

1478.399 --> 1481.84
lame when I was

1482.28 --> 1486.21
[Music]

1487.88 --> 1494.279
younger because they're all spooky and

1490.52 --> 1494.279
slow in the old

1496.76 --> 1499.76
stuff

1502.159 --> 1510.96
maybe somebody stole Sean what his

1507.399 --> 1510.9599999999998
bike that's a good

1511.72 --> 1519.24
one de Lugo C1 yeah the black and white

1516.64 --> 1521.919
stuff I don't think I've ever actually

1519.24 --> 1521.919
just watched

1526.679 --> 1529.679
it

1530.44 --> 1535.15
yes random explor I got that Sean Hawk

1533.0 --> 1540.579
Sean Hawkins bike I get

1535.15 --> 1540.5790000000002
[Music]

1542.48 --> 1549.48
it bro somebody stole my bike like six

1546.64 --> 1549.48
years ago

1553.64 --> 1559.0800000000002
here that was

1556.679 --> 1561.8400000000001
weird

1559.08 --> 1564.36
but I suspect it was like two kids one

1561.84 --> 1567.8799999999999
of which was black and the other was

1564.36 --> 1571.9599999999998
white like this weird little gang out

1567.88 --> 1575.7600000000002
there but there were like I

1571.96 --> 1575.76
mean 12 at

1576.96 --> 1582.52
best never caught them though but I did

1579.6 --> 1585.4399999999998
see them around all the time when there

1582.52 --> 1589.279
were bikes getting stolen so I suspect

1585.44 --> 1592.3200000000002
them cuz they were snooping around the

1589.279 --> 1596.08
bikes back

1592.32 --> 1596.08
then but uh

1596.279 --> 1602.039
yeah what can you do except lock your

1602.399 --> 1609.6399999999999
bike yes he he I'm sure it's that way

1606.6 --> 1613.0
and not the other way around I'm sure of

1609.64 --> 1615.6000000000001
it I I don't know

1613.0 --> 1618.64
man I think they might have just been

1615.6 --> 1620.559
doing it for the kicks

1618.64 --> 1624.24
and

1620.559 --> 1626.1589999999999
yeah because when I was younger I never

1624.24 --> 1628.679
was interested in actually stealing

1626.159 --> 1630.44
bikes but I was interested in the kicks

1628.679 --> 1632.24
like doing naughty

1630.44 --> 1635.76
things or

1632.24 --> 1638.36
like sneaking into a

1635.76 --> 1642.679
place like that was the biggest kick

1638.36 --> 1642.6789999999999
ever it's just like sneaking into a

1645.76 --> 1651.2
place and then I would get caught and

1648.36 --> 1652.9599999999998
then I would like ah run away I'd never

1651.2 --> 1655.2
like steal anything or anything but just

1652.96 --> 1658.3990000000001
like just weird just sneak into

1655.2 --> 1660.2
something and just like when people are

1658.399 --> 1662.6789999999999
there and then hope that they don't

1660.2 --> 1662.679
notice

1662.88 --> 1667.519
you I'd like hide in a closet somewhere

1666.08 --> 1670.08
it was really

1667.519 --> 1671.799
weird like people were really shocked

1670.08 --> 1673.76
about that when they first like disc

1671.799 --> 1676.399
discover me like like what the hell's

1673.76 --> 1678.32
going on I just like no I just like to

1676.399 --> 1681.32
play hide and seek

1678.32 --> 1684.279
[Music]

1681.32 --> 1684.279
I was such a weird

1686.279 --> 1692.88
kid but yeah I know all

1689.12 --> 1696.6
about hanging with other kids and then

1692.88 --> 1699.8400000000001
like challenging each other to do

1696.6 --> 1701.799
something test of Bravery I love that I

1699.84 --> 1704.08
love the test of Bravery because I would

1701.799 --> 1705.799
be crazy enough to do almost anything

1704.08 --> 1709.36
unless I could

1705.799 --> 1711.96
like logically uce that it would like

1709.36 --> 1714.36
end up harming me physically I'm not

1711.96 --> 1714.3600000000001
doing

1716.36 --> 1722.799
that like I was very flexible very agile

1721.039 --> 1724.679
I could do a whole bunch of things but I

1722.799 --> 1728.97
wouldn't like just

1724.679 --> 1732.16
take damning risk to my

1728.97 --> 1732.16
[Music]

1736.399 --> 1740.32
physique

1738.24 --> 1743.039
got to stop voice chat while driving

1740.32 --> 1743.039
don't worry about

1745.72 --> 1753.159
it I don't know what it means though the

1748.48 --> 1753.159
white guy had was fresher into

1756.24 --> 1759.44
[Music]

1764.36 --> 1770.4399999999998
it what wow okay that's kind of messed

1768.279 --> 1770.44
up

1778.159 --> 1784.64
slow-mo yeah that's messed

1780.799 --> 1787.96
up and I mean yeah young kids do go get

1784.64 --> 1792.3600000000001
up to no good just to distract

1787.96 --> 1792.3600000000001
themselves just to find some kind of

1794.279 --> 1799.679
purpose just to feel like they're again

1798.12 --> 1804.0
so that makes

1799.679 --> 1806.0
sense yeah that did escalate a bit

1804.0 --> 1808.32
quick that's

1806.0 --> 1811.36
fine I mean I

1808.32 --> 1814.799
had I've never like been actually

1811.36 --> 1817.76
molested thank God but a couple of times

1814.799 --> 1820.96
were really close

1817.76 --> 1824.039
calls the problem was what it did do to

1820.96 --> 1825.3990000000001
me was make me realize the world's like

1824.039 --> 1828.24
really

1825.399 --> 1830.1999999999998
hostile at a very young age AG like

1828.24 --> 1833.6
really hostile like now people are

1830.2 --> 1836.64
really dangerous but then I couldn't

1833.6 --> 1839.039
keep that knowledge straight into my

1836.64 --> 1841.519
mind without becoming monstrously

1839.039 --> 1844.1589999999999
depressed and scared of the outside

1841.519 --> 1847.159
world so I would then just like kind of

1844.159 --> 1847.159
forget it suppress

1847.64 --> 1854.88
it pretend like it never really

1851.799 --> 1857.0
happened but the restlessness of that

1854.88 --> 1858.24
realization would still creep up on me

1857.0 --> 1861.159
from from the background from my

1858.24 --> 1862.919
subconscious and I would like get very

1861.159 --> 1866.7600000000002
restless and have days where I would

1862.919 --> 1866.76
just like go out there do weird

1866.919 --> 1872.2
stuff

1868.639 --> 1874.9599999999998
like climb in some tree and then SP try

1872.2 --> 1874.96
to spy on

1876.72 --> 1883.3990000000001
everything that kind of stuff

1879.44 --> 1883.3990000000001
or just sneaking

1886.159 --> 1889.159
around

1890.799 --> 1894.559
and like get up to no good with other

1899.039 --> 1904.559
kids some of which like actually like

1902.279 --> 1906.519
border fandalism but I never like did

1904.559 --> 1909.32
Van I always hated vand it's like no

1906.519 --> 1912.24
don't destroy anything especially for

1909.32 --> 1916.039
fun maybe during New Year's Eve with

1912.24 --> 1918.2
fireworks because it's like come on but

1916.039 --> 1919.96
in general it's like no don't don't

1918.2 --> 1921.72
break any freaking

1919.96 --> 1925.32
windows

1921.72 --> 1927.76
don't demolish trash cans or whatever

1925.32 --> 1930.279
like I didn't like

1927.76 --> 1932.48
that some of the kids that I did hang

1930.279 --> 1934.559
around with did have Tendencies to do

1932.48 --> 1935.559
that and I would like criticize them

1934.559 --> 1938.0
about

1935.559 --> 1940.399
it and then I didn't always get to hang

1938.0 --> 1940.399
around

1946.08 --> 1949.48
them

1947.6 --> 1951.76
and some of the those kids that I did

1949.48 --> 1954.6
hang around they did actually like go

1951.76 --> 1954.6
criminal and

1955.36 --> 1962.519
[ __ ] like started drug dealing at some

1959.2 --> 1962.519
point was

1970.12 --> 1978.1589999999999
weird jack shaving God toilet paper yeah

1975.88 --> 1982.0800000000002
slowmo is so

1978.159 --> 1984.3200000000002
silly but I get it though I totally get

1982.08 --> 1984.32
the

1990.83 --> 1994.1999999999998
[Music]

1998.96 --> 2002.089
[Music]

2005.96 --> 2008.96
appeal

2013.2 --> 2019.24
but I mean logically you know when you

2015.279 --> 2021.88
think about it yeah if you have like

2019.24 --> 2025.639
very serious trauma when you're young

2021.88 --> 2029.24
really young pretin and all

2025.639 --> 2034.4799999999998
that whether it's like sexual abuse or

2029.24 --> 2034.48
just like assault or

2034.679 --> 2041.679
whatever or like dead beat you going

2038.24 --> 2043.639
going insane whatever like that stuff it

2041.679 --> 2047.0
does make you

2043.639 --> 2049.0789999999997
like Restless whether whether you're

2047.0 --> 2051.28
like really conscious about it or not

2049.079 --> 2053.8
usually you just learn to put it in the

2051.28 --> 2053.8
back of your

2053.879 --> 2058.679
mind but you still get the restlessness

2056.56 --> 2062.44
and a lot of ways that kids deal with

2058.679 --> 2065.879
that is by just going out and being up

2062.44 --> 2068.359
to no good because it's like that's

2065.879 --> 2073.7999999999997
their

2068.359 --> 2078.0789999999997
play way to kind of deal with the the

2073.8 --> 2082.679
the darkness that that assaulted

2078.079 --> 2085.76
them I think it's it's to try and man up

2082.679 --> 2087.48
in the face of risk I really think that

2085.76 --> 2089.32
that is what that is with kids and

2087.48 --> 2092.8
that's why I'm

2089.32 --> 2095.28
not like really hating on

2092.8 --> 2097.5600000000004
it when I see young kids and they're up

2095.28 --> 2099.92
to no good

2097.56 --> 2102.359
I I get annoyed and I will be like that

2099.92 --> 2106.48
old man like hey how dare you old kids

2102.359 --> 2108.0
right I I love doing that that's

2106.48 --> 2110.96
cool

2108.0 --> 2112.56
but like I'm not going to actually like

2110.96 --> 2116.28
treat them like criminals because

2112.56 --> 2120.64
they're probably doing that to get some

2116.28 --> 2120.6400000000003
to to work through some stuff

2121.2 --> 2126.56
internally that's how I think of

2124.079 --> 2128.76
it right as long as it just don't go too

2126.56 --> 2131.92
far and don't like physically assault

2128.76 --> 2135.5200000000004
somebody or whatever or really vandalize

2131.92 --> 2139.6800000000003
things then it's cool that just got to

2135.52 --> 2139.68
work through stuff

2153.4 --> 2157.48
anyway like and in a way there is

2155.64 --> 2159.64
another way to deal with it too and that

2157.48 --> 2162.2400000000002
some are really good at

2159.64 --> 2166.24
that it's like there's a kid there's

2162.24 --> 2169.2799999999997
some kid or kids that are like pulling

2166.24 --> 2173.319
Mischief well if you really want them to

2169.28 --> 2173.3190000000004
stop give them something else to

2177.079 --> 2184.92
do right give them another challenge

2180.599 --> 2188.2400000000002
like maybe some kind of preliminary job

2184.92 --> 2194.4
or whatever a hustle

2188.24 --> 2194.3999999999996
thingy like cuz that will be very

2196.92 --> 2203.16
appealing and if you can like make them

2200.16 --> 2205.2799999999997
do more regular work instead of them

2203.16 --> 2206.3999999999996
ending up like doing drug dealing and

2205.28 --> 2210.52
that kind of

2206.4 --> 2210.52
crap that's going to be better for

2210.599 --> 2216.7200000000003
them I've seen people do that there were

2214.119 --> 2219.0
some people that would do that with me

2216.72 --> 2221.9599999999996
me when I was younger because they

2219.0 --> 2224.64
realized I'm just a freaking broken kid

2221.96 --> 2226.2
when they caught me like in doing

2224.64 --> 2228.72
something like running through their

2226.2 --> 2231.7999999999997
garden and I'd get really emotional

2228.72 --> 2235.7999999999997
about it like I'm so sorry I've

2231.8 --> 2239.0
just I don't mean any harm trying to be

2235.8 --> 2242.28
good boy I I mean it's it was real

2239.0 --> 2242.28
though like

2242.88 --> 2248.599
I I was just chasing ghosts basically

2257.839 --> 2261.2
right but

2261.68 --> 2268.9199999999996
like the more dark type streak of

2265.48 --> 2270.2400000000002
Vengeance and all that I never had that

2268.92 --> 2275.56
as a

2270.24 --> 2275.56
kid that [ __ ] came later that came

2275.599 --> 2284.1600000000003
after meeting the Jesuit guy and and the

2280.8 --> 2287.92
yeah and the big vision and all that

2284.16 --> 2291.48
like that that time you got to realize I

2287.92 --> 2294.599
got shove things in my face that my mind

2291.48 --> 2297.0
never even got close to considering

2294.599 --> 2297.0
thinking

2300.76 --> 2306.0
about in a way that experience like

2303.64 --> 2310.0
forced me to grow up in ways that I

2306.0 --> 2314.119
wasn't ready to to go

2310.0 --> 2315.52
there and that spawned Vengeance like

2314.119 --> 2318.2000000000003
real

2315.52 --> 2322.56
Vengeance in

2318.2 --> 2324.7999999999997
me it's like if you force knowledge onto

2322.56 --> 2329.4
somebody that's not ready for it and you

2324.8 --> 2332.5600000000004
really force it onto them there will be

2329.4 --> 2334.56
Revenge yeah but forcing actually means

2332.56 --> 2337.24
forcing and that isn't like oh I'm

2334.56 --> 2340.44
having a show having a show Show online

2337.24 --> 2343.5989999999997
is not forcing it on you yeah you can

2340.44 --> 2345.92
choose to tune in or not to tune in

2343.599 --> 2348.599
definitely not forcing on you so

2345.92 --> 2348.599
definitely

2350.76 --> 2355.96
not justifying Vengeance as a

2356.4 --> 2360.359
response all right

2363.72 --> 2369.2799999999997
anyway dialed in my moral compass early

2366.64 --> 2369.2799999999997
30s

2371.16 --> 2378.5989999999997
right now I but I always had my moral

2374.76 --> 2381.28
compass but I also had to just be

2378.599 --> 2383.48
naughty and stuff like it was healthier

2381.28 --> 2386.6400000000003
for

2383.48 --> 2388.88
me cuz if I just followed the moral

2386.64 --> 2391.16
compass and was just a pure good boy I

2388.88 --> 2393.76
would have become so [ __ ] fragile it

2391.16 --> 2393.7599999999998
would have been

2395.4 --> 2398.4
embarrassing

2403.4 --> 2409.48
I already like even during my teens and

2406.52 --> 2409.48
I had to

2411.2 --> 2417.839
like it's so weird cuz I had always

2415.079 --> 2420.2400000000002
like you had the really good kids I

2417.839 --> 2421.839
would hang around them but then i' get

2420.24 --> 2425.0789999999997
so

2421.839 --> 2427.96
bored and then there were like more up

2425.079 --> 2430.119
to no good kids

2427.96 --> 2434.04
and they were white yeah just to be

2430.119 --> 2437.52
clear I I did not have like any black

2434.04 --> 2441.44
friends because there were barely any

2437.52 --> 2443.68
around when I was young and they made me

2441.44 --> 2443.68
really

2444.079 --> 2447.48
nervous but

2448.52 --> 2455.72
uh like the no good up to no good kids

2452.24 --> 2457.8799999999997
like I would then eventually like end up

2455.72 --> 2461.359
like no I'm not doing that like that's

2457.88 --> 2464.079
wrong and then they' get annoyed with

2461.359 --> 2466.48
me so I have those memories like really

2464.079 --> 2469.5600000000004
good kids they were always super nice

2466.48 --> 2472.92
and honest and good but i' get really

2469.56 --> 2475.2799999999997
bored and then the not so good kids I

2472.92 --> 2477.4
wouldn't get bored but they'd always end

2475.28 --> 2480.92
up like trying to make me do something

2477.4 --> 2480.92
really dark and I'd like

2481.079 --> 2486.8390000000004
no definitely not doing

2485.24 --> 2491.04
that

2486.839 --> 2491.04
so that didn't really work all that well

2507.04 --> 2512.7599999999998
either cuz like when I was a kid I just

2510.0 --> 2515.88
wanted Adventure that's really what I

2512.76 --> 2516.8390000000004
wanted like this call just made me like

2515.88 --> 2519.52
I wanted

2516.839 --> 2521.92
get out there and just I would just want

2519.52 --> 2523.88
to know what's over there that place

2521.92 --> 2527.76
where I haven't been

2523.88 --> 2529.92
before just see what that the what the

2527.76 --> 2531.599
geography is like what the buildings are

2529.92 --> 2534.7200000000003
like what the atmosphere is like what

2531.599 --> 2534.7200000000003
type of people live

2542.72 --> 2551.7999999999997
there all right and nowadays I mean that

2548.559 --> 2556.559
Wonder lust kind of thing

2551.8 --> 2558.8
has been transplanted or displaced

2556.559 --> 2562.44
shifted it's the better word it's

2558.8 --> 2565.8
shifted from more physical type

2562.44 --> 2569.92
exploration to mental because that

2565.8 --> 2574.7200000000003
pattern of Wonder lust is a pattern it

2569.92 --> 2574.7200000000003
that's now in my dreams and it's there

2575.16 --> 2581.0
forever and it's in my mind so it's like

2578.16 --> 2584.48
I transplanted the wonderlust

2581.0 --> 2586.92
pattern like onto my

2584.48 --> 2589.8
mental in

2586.92 --> 2593.359
visualization and that worked it's part

2589.8 --> 2593.3590000000004
of the reason I'm I'm a

2599.2 --> 2604.52
wizard cuz I got intellectual Wonder

2604.92 --> 2609.04
lust and

2606.96 --> 2611.64
anyway hope you guys are enjoying the

2609.04 --> 2611.64
show thus

2613.96 --> 2621.04
far six people in

2619.079 --> 2622.92
chat talking

2621.04 --> 2626.96
about the

2622.92 --> 2632.28
youth those youths these

2626.96 --> 2632.28
days and in our days when we were

2632.86 --> 2636.26
[Music]

2635.079 --> 2640.2090000000003
youths

2636.26 --> 2640.2090000000003
[Music]

2658.16 --> 2663.04
right but yeah so a lot of people have

2660.96 --> 2666.44
like weird

2663.04 --> 2669.52
moral compasses up until they 30 is

2666.44 --> 2671.52
that's like a lot of people some just

2669.52 --> 2673.44
always have it from birth like once

2671.52 --> 2674.72
they're born they have a moral compass

2673.44 --> 2676.44
even though they know know how to talk

2674.72 --> 2679.0789999999997
they have a moral compass and it's like

2676.44 --> 2681.44
nothing can change that and other people

2679.079 --> 2684.1600000000003
like they have to like kind of figure it

2681.44 --> 2689.04
out as they go and they have a lot of

2684.16 --> 2692.44
trouble during their teenss with it I

2689.04 --> 2697.8
was in a way like

2692.44 --> 2700.04
that cuz I just had weird damage and

2697.8 --> 2702.76
compartmentalization so on the spiritual

2700.04 --> 2706.04
side it's like absolute

2702.76 --> 2709.599
good but physically it would be like no

2706.04 --> 2713.04
this place is not so good so you can't

2709.599 --> 2714.92
be expected to be as good as in the

2713.04 --> 2717.92
spiritual and the physical and that's

2714.92 --> 2717.92
kind of like how it went

2718.96 --> 2724.88
around but it wasn't great so I guess in

2721.88 --> 2727.88
the way we had it the

2724.88 --> 2727.88
same

2729.48 --> 2736.68
oh drugs you into drugs

2733.119 --> 2738.96
right sexually promiscuous well I tried

2736.68 --> 2742.319
to be sexually promiscuous I can tell

2738.96 --> 2746.119
you that but it didn't real it didn't

2742.319 --> 2748.5589999999997
work because I really just wanted love

2746.119 --> 2751.44
it was always about that I was like

2748.559 --> 2751.44
obsessed with

2754.88 --> 2762.7200000000003
Romance like sex I

2758.4 --> 2765.04
care very little but if it's with

2762.72 --> 2767.4399999999996
somebody that's like really into you and

2765.04 --> 2770.64
you're really into them that's just

2767.44 --> 2773.04
magical like you can't like that's where

2770.64 --> 2775.1189999999997
your like Consciousness starts to detach

2773.04 --> 2777.24
from normal physical

2775.119 --> 2779.96
reality and that's where it just all

2777.24 --> 2783.1189999999997
becomes energy it's amazing then you get

2779.96 --> 2783.119
telepathy and

2784.8 --> 2788.559
everything that's real

2788.8 --> 2793.8390000000004
love but with real love also comes real

2798.04 --> 2805.839
pain but I mean my first sexual

2802.079 --> 2805.8390000000004
relationship I got when I was

2806.44 --> 2813.04
18 and I really tried to get it earlier

2810.16 --> 2813.04
but it's just like

2813.76 --> 2821.1600000000003
no women weren't doing

2816.599 --> 2821.1600000000003
it like they wouldn't have it from

2824.079 --> 2827.48
me until

2830.04 --> 2835.119
18 right also I I mostly stayed away

2833.16 --> 2838.04
from alcohol because well even when I

2835.119 --> 2842.079
was really younger I had just terrible

2838.04 --> 2843.839
experiences with drinking too much like

2842.079 --> 2845.8
well I don't want to go all there again

2843.839 --> 2847.04
but I mean I have my fair share of

2845.8 --> 2850.28
getting

2847.04 --> 2853.7599999999998
sick and that started in my

2850.28 --> 2857.3590000000004
teens early and the alcohol like made it

2853.76 --> 2859.6400000000003
a lot a lot worse it's like a whole lot

2857.359 --> 2863.48
worse so

2859.64 --> 2866.7999999999997
uh but I did get into weed

2863.48 --> 2869.44
though I didn't I I kind of stuck to

2866.8 --> 2871.88
that though I barely tried any of

2869.44 --> 2874.16
anything

2871.88 --> 2877.119
else cuz I just wasn't really

2874.16 --> 2879.1189999999997
interesting in Moving On

2877.119 --> 2882.4
from wheat it's just like no this stuff

2879.119 --> 2885.48
is is exactly what I

2882.4 --> 2887.079
need any ways like it calmed me down

2885.48 --> 2889.88
very

2887.079 --> 2892.44
seriously and made me be more like I

2889.88 --> 2892.44
wanted to

2896.8 --> 2903.2400000000002
be right also because I wouldn't just

2900.559 --> 2905.3190000000004
automatically become stupid from it like

2903.24 --> 2907.0
a lot of weat smokers I that I hung

2905.319 --> 2911.68
around with with like you they smoke

2907.0 --> 2916.119
weed they just become dumb it's very

2911.68 --> 2916.1189999999997
annoying but with me now it

2917.92 --> 2923.28
would just give me this surreal

2920.8 --> 2925.8
curiosity and like this esoteric type

2923.28 --> 2927.92
insights that I've specialized in

2925.8 --> 2930.92
talking

2927.92 --> 2930.92
about

2934.599 --> 2940.4
so

2936.24 --> 2942.72
like weed in my teens was for me just an

2940.4 --> 2945.96
important component in my Spiritual

2942.72 --> 2949.52
Development and fortunately though it

2945.96 --> 2951.0
went at the cost of my societal

2949.52 --> 2953.88
development and

2951.0 --> 2956.88
integration so yeah I was like

2953.88 --> 2961.6400000000003
completely uninterested in getting

2956.88 --> 2963.839
jobs like totally uninterested like if

2961.64 --> 2967.52
my parents would tell me things like

2963.839 --> 2967.52
that I would literally get

2967.96 --> 2974.7200000000003
impressed it's like but I have so much

2971.319 --> 2980.64
to figure out like I don't have time for

2974.72 --> 2980.64
that like that's torture I'd be so

2982.28 --> 2986.96
bored and really at later age is when I

2985.799 --> 2990.799
was

2986.96 --> 2991.799
like I just did get jobs and got into

2990.799 --> 2993.88
like

2991.799 --> 2996.359
catering that's like one of the more

2993.88 --> 2998.48
successful branches around food and all

2996.359 --> 3001.319
that surprisingly not so surprisingly

2998.48 --> 3001.319
really I'm good with

3003.559 --> 3009.3590000000004
food but it was

3006.48 --> 3012.359
boring and like I couldn't connect with

3009.359 --> 3016.24
the people that were in that line of

3012.359 --> 3019.319
work a lot of them were really depressed

3016.24 --> 3023.2799999999997
like they just wouldn't communicate at

3019.319 --> 3025.68
all it's not great as a career to be

3023.28 --> 3027.44
around people that are like I'm sticking

3025.68 --> 3031.64
to this job even though I'm really

3027.44 --> 3031.64
depressed sticking to this job

3050.68 --> 3057.44
like

3052.319 --> 3057.44
what your first was

3060.48 --> 3066.04
what what the hell so are you saying you

3063.599 --> 3066.04
had

3066.68 --> 3073.839
sex in the next room after Ronald Raven

3070.68 --> 3073.839
got shot

3082.16 --> 3086.5589999999997
what that's kind of

3084.359 --> 3090.64
weird

3086.559 --> 3092.28

3090.64 --> 3095.0789999999997
around and like with a whole bunch of

3092.28 --> 3097.96
girls and I was naughty I was naughty I

3095.079 --> 3099.28
would like try to do it in public places

3097.96 --> 3102.88
and all that

3099.28 --> 3105.2400000000002
[ __ ] not super in everybody's face but

3102.88 --> 3108.48
definitely in places where there's a lot

3105.24 --> 3111.4799999999996
of people around and then like do it in

3108.48 --> 3114.359

anything really

3158.64 --> 3164.16
wealthy like

3161.16 --> 3166.1189999999997
that I mean some of them probably tried

3164.16 --> 3169.359
but then it's like yeah they're just

3166.119 --> 3171.4
sitting there staring H having a lot of

3169.359 --> 3173.319
money and then I could literally

3171.4 --> 3176.64
palpably

3173.319 --> 3180.24
feel all those things things they were

3176.64 --> 3182.359
perpetually not allowing into their

3180.24 --> 3183.839
Consciousness like they just sit there

3182.359 --> 3185.92
and it's like yeah there's like a

3183.839 --> 3187.96
thousand things you should be pondering

3185.92 --> 3191.76
about with your moral compass right now

3187.96 --> 3193.2
and you're not doing it I could feel it

3191.76 --> 3195.92
oozing off

3193.2 --> 3201.4399999999996
them it wasn't alone like my parents too

3195.92 --> 3201.44

3212.52 --> 3218.359
not caring about anybody

3620.88 --> 3626.88
sensitive to people's oh

3623.559 --> 3628.44
right okay then I get it because yeah I

3626.88 --> 3630.4
can

3628.44 --> 3634.92
be

3630.4 --> 3634.92
invasive when it comes to feelings I get

3635.76 --> 3640.76
it but I mean I'm really keeping calm

3639.0 --> 3643.599
today so don't

3640.76 --> 3646.8390000000004
worry not just no I know it's everybody

3643.599 --> 3649.6400000000003
you'll just really be able to tell with

3646.839 --> 3652.119
me like I am the canary in the coal mine

3649.64 --> 3655.359
of feelings and like if there's

3652.119 --> 3658.2000000000003
something astrological going on

3655.359 --> 3661.7599999999998
like o moon is getting full how do you

3658.2 --> 3664.5589999999997
know well look at Arwin or like oh the

3661.76 --> 3667.079
weather's really bad how do you know

3664.559 --> 3667.079
well look at

3673.119 --> 3677.92
Arwin but

3675.72 --> 3681.16
uh I mean I

3677.92 --> 3684.0
am trying to keeping keep myself stable

3681.16 --> 3686.16
and it's working I mean the intervention

3684.0 --> 3690.359
for my healer yesterday like did

3686.16 --> 3694.1189999999997
enormous amounts of good I mean I

3690.359 --> 3697.4
cannot emphasize enough like how

3694.119 --> 3697.4
much that

3698.119 --> 3705.7200000000003
fixes like without that it's just like

3702.559 --> 3707.28
oh Everything feels more tiresome I just

3705.72 --> 3711.16
get

3707.28 --> 3714.76
a like feel like a puddle of Mud about

3711.16 --> 3717.319
to solidify in misery or something right

3714.76 --> 3721.0
but when he does that it's like every

3717.319 --> 3722.96
all those effects just like stop and

3721.0 --> 3725.48
there's still the Restless energy in

3722.96 --> 3728.48
general but now it just doesn't turn me

3725.48 --> 3728.48
into a puddle of

3729.039 --> 3734.1600000000003
Mud a human

3731.799 --> 3736.279
barometer who needs the Weather Channel

3734.16 --> 3738.8799999999997
yeah I know right who does need the

3736.279 --> 3741.799
Weather Channel I mean this is literally

3738.88 --> 3743.359
partially The Weather Channel it's just

3741.799 --> 3746.359
the Weather Channel in the

3743.359 --> 3746.359
Netherlands

3747.48 --> 3752.88
but it really has stood out to me that

3750.2 --> 3755.1189999999997
in the west in the United States

3752.88 --> 3757.319
England and the

3755.119 --> 3760.96
Netherlands and I don't know further

3757.319 --> 3763.72
east but the weather is not really that

3760.96 --> 3766.68
far off each other every time it's not

3763.72 --> 3768.9199999999996
that extreme a contrast it's kind of

3766.68 --> 3770.8799999999997
rare that it's like super hard snowing

3768.92 --> 3772.76
in the United States everywhere and that

3770.88 --> 3776.359
it's just mild weather here I mean

3772.76 --> 3776.3590000000004
that's kind of rare

3777.16 --> 3782.839
it does H it has happened a couple of

3780.72 --> 3784.9599999999996
periods but not

3782.839 --> 3786.599
often most of the time it's kind of

3784.96 --> 3788.559
synchronous like oh it's getting really

3786.599 --> 3791.119
rainy here then well it's probably

3788.559 --> 3794.119
getting really rainy in England and in

3791.119 --> 3795.6400000000003
the United States at spots it just

3794.119 --> 3799.52
somehow it

3795.64 --> 3799.52
synchronizes it seems at

3800.44 --> 3807.76
least right but yeah Rich you're bit

3803.279 --> 3811.079
sensitive at the moment that's

3807.76 --> 3815.3590000000004
cool no worries I'm not going

3811.079 --> 3815.3590000000004
to be angry today at

3819.63 --> 3822.869
[Music]

3823.2 --> 3828.8799999999997
all but I do have trouble going to bed I

3826.24 --> 3831.5589999999997
have noticed that I have just this

3828.88 --> 3833.88
restlessness at night where I'm like no

3831.559 --> 3837.7200000000003
I want to stay up I want to stay up like

3833.88 --> 3841.1600000000003
dude you're not freaking seven

3837.72 --> 3846.3999999999996
anymore stop trying to stay up all

3841.16 --> 3849.3999999999996
night yeah like I'm not literally

3846.4 --> 3851.599
jumping but it does feel like that it's

3849.4 --> 3854.039
just like I just want to see another

3851.599 --> 3857.079
thing I just want to do another thing I

3854.039 --> 3858.599
just want just no just turn it off and

3857.079 --> 3861.7200000000003
go to

3858.599 --> 3863.2000000000003
bed I have that issue sometimes

3861.72 --> 3866.0789999999997
especially around

3863.2 --> 3868.24
Winters

3866.079 --> 3871.279
I just get so distracted I just want to

3868.24 --> 3872.319
keep going until I drop over basically

3871.279 --> 3877.039
it's just

3872.319 --> 3877.0389999999998
not a good instinct to

3879.44 --> 3887.64
follow I wonder sometimes if it's like

3883.48 --> 3891.68
if in those times my brain somehow like

3887.64 --> 3894.48
creates artificial meth or something

3891.68 --> 3897.7599999999998
because it does kind of feel like like

3894.48 --> 3900.799
that like no not that I've like

3897.76 --> 3902.92
personally taken that but I've been

3900.799 --> 3904.88
around people that have and there's a

3902.92 --> 3907.64
very specific thing that happens to them

3904.88 --> 3910.52
that I can feel from them and that's

3907.64 --> 3914.0
kind of what it feels

3910.52 --> 3917.119
like it's just like

3914.0 --> 3920.0
yay or like when you had a coffee

3917.119 --> 3921.48
overdose except you you haven't I didn't

3920.0 --> 3923.559
have a coffee over there it's not the

3921.48 --> 3925.72
coffee keeping me up it's just me just

3923.559 --> 3928.1600000000003
like I want I want more I want to see

3925.72 --> 3929.64
more I don't want to go to

3928.16 --> 3931.8799999999997
[Music]

3929.64 --> 3935.0789999999997
bed and that's why I'm an hour late

3931.88 --> 3935.079
today pretty

3942.48 --> 3948.119
much I don't know why I have to like get

3945.359 --> 3950.319
all this enthusiasm in the last hours of

3948.119 --> 3950.319
the

3953.079 --> 3956.079
night

3959.2 --> 3963.3999999999996
all right let me get my coffee I'll be

3961.16 --> 3963.3999999999996
right

3983.0 --> 3986.0
back

4013.0 --> 4016.0
e

4034.48 --> 4037.69
[Music]

4042.359 --> 4047.359
and in there

4045.48 --> 4049.279
reading an article that mentioned how

4047.359 --> 4051.2
there is strong correlation between

4049.279 --> 4054.2
drinking coffee and having

4051.2 --> 4054.2
diabetes

4056.64 --> 4061.8799999999997
H yeah

4058.64 --> 4065.0
maybe but I mean I bet

4061.88 --> 4067.44
that's also involves people taking sugar

4065.0 --> 4067.44
in their

4068.64 --> 4074.839
coffee but I agree coffee would

4072.079 --> 4078.3590000000004
eventually like either get on my stomach

4074.839 --> 4081.92
or like get on my

4078.359 --> 4081.92
pancreas I could feel

4083.76 --> 4089.96
it sugar and cream

4087.079 --> 4092.799
yeah well unfortunately I do take a bit

4089.96 --> 4092.799
of sugar in my

4093.64 --> 4101.4
coffee but bro when when I like in my

4097.88 --> 4104.92
teens or 20s when I drink coffee I would

4101.4 --> 4108.159
like put so much sugar in it like a

4104.92 --> 4113.92
lot like three

4108.159 --> 4113.92
scoops instead of one that I do

4116.479 --> 4119.569
[Music]

4120.0 --> 4126.56
now and yeah that's not

4123.759 --> 4129.799
good like it's the sugar it's pretty

4126.56 --> 4131.799
much the sugar I mean coffee does have

4129.799 --> 4134.2789999999995
like an influence on your spirit it

4131.799 --> 4136.5199999999995
makes you more susceptible to iron it

4134.279 --> 4139.759
does makes you more

4136.52 --> 4142.279
robotic it numbs down certain sensories

4139.759 --> 4144.319
that are really

4142.279 --> 4148.359
subtle which is not good if you're like

4144.319 --> 4150.400000000001
a Healer or something but in general

4148.359 --> 4153.400000000001
like if you're just a working guy it's

4150.4 --> 4156.0
not bad but it's the sugar that actually

4153.4 --> 4158.199
does the physical damage a lot if you

4156.0 --> 4159.96
drink it with sugar and most people do

4158.199 --> 4162.719
drink coffee with

4159.96 --> 4165.719
sugar hey dupons good to see

4162.719 --> 4165.719
you

4171.12 --> 4175.159
stomach was screwed so you switch to

4172.759 --> 4178.6
plain black

4175.159 --> 4182.12
yeah well it's kind of weird

4178.6 --> 4185.1990000000005
because that's how I quit coffee on the

4182.12 --> 4188.679
show before I started

4185.199 --> 4192.719
again I just put too much sugar in it

4188.679 --> 4196.08
and that made me sick literally

4192.719 --> 4198.52
eventually now the amount of sugar is

4196.08 --> 4202.32
just much less and it's just enough to

4198.52 --> 4202.320000000001
kind of like remind me of a bit of

4204.62 --> 4207.8189999999995
[Music]

4208.28 --> 4212.5599999999995
sweetness all right but I don't have

4210.48 --> 4215.919999999999
like those stomach issues like I used to

4212.56 --> 4218.84
but it's also probably because I at the

4215.92 --> 4221.92
time when I was drinking coffee I would

4218.84 --> 4227.12
also be drinking beer in the

4221.92 --> 4227.12
evening like I've been doing that since

4228.28 --> 4234.719
200 15 or 16 I was like drinking beer

4233.159 --> 4238.799999999999
like every

4234.719 --> 4243.4
day I kind of started doing

4238.8 --> 4245.08
that and then I quit

4243.4 --> 4248.679
again was

4245.08 --> 4248.679
it two years

4252.64 --> 4255.64
ago

4260.8 --> 4265.92
okay dup yeah thank you for that that is

4263.64 --> 4265.92
kind of

4266.04 --> 4273.56
funny

4268.679 --> 4276.32
oh I just imagined like oh there you

4273.56 --> 4279.080000000001
go yeah that would have been

4276.32 --> 4281.84
amazing that have made me like jump up

4279.08 --> 4281.84
and applaud

4282.08 --> 4285.84
loudly if that would have

4291.84 --> 4296.56
happened how's my left shoulder been

4293.96 --> 4298.2390000000005
holding up great actually that's funny

4296.56 --> 4301.159000000001
that you're asking that I I wanted to

4298.239 --> 4306.159
bring it up I've gone down

4301.159 --> 4309.96
to just uh singular doses of Vitamin C

4306.159 --> 4311.5599999999995
again right I had this triple for a time

4309.96 --> 4314.36
because I really because it was just

4311.56 --> 4317.52
hurting and hurting all the time

4314.36 --> 4321.92
and then I went back to two

4317.52 --> 4325.0
eventually and in like now for a week or

4321.92 --> 4327.92
two I'm only taking singular again and

4325.0 --> 4331.639
it's fine my shoulder is doing well it's

4327.92 --> 4332.56
it actually feels more whole it feels

4331.639 --> 4335.6
more

4332.56 --> 4338.320000000001
symmetrical less

4335.6 --> 4341.320000000001
naughty like in a

4338.32 --> 4341.32
knot

4342.48 --> 4348.239
loser

4344.28 --> 4351.32
I've also like massaged it myself which

4348.239 --> 4351.32
I can do I'm very

4352.6 --> 4356.719
flexible I've taken good care of

4357.36 --> 4363.239
it what was the left shoulder problem

4361.12 --> 4365.84
pain

4363.239 --> 4368.08
yes I thought at first that like oh my

4365.84 --> 4371.96
God is that my heart or something but it

4368.08 --> 4376.6
was just like the muscles were achy

4371.96 --> 4379.679
and like there was this this rib that

4376.6 --> 4381.4800000000005
would just like not sit exactly right

4379.679 --> 4383.32
not to the point where you get like try

4381.48 --> 4385.32
to breathe in it's like that kind of

4383.32 --> 4388.799999999999
like like a shock or anything but it's

4385.32 --> 4393.159
just like it would never really sit re

4388.8 --> 4393.159000000001
good and then it just like this

4393.4 --> 4398.799999999999
nagging some of these muscles would just

4395.88 --> 4401.639
like keep tensing up and tensing up all

4398.8 --> 4405.360000000001
the time and it would really like keep

4401.639 --> 4405.36
me awake at night

4405.96 --> 4413.0
but yeah I mean it's still a tension

4410.48 --> 4417.5199999999995
receiver this is still a place where the

4413.0 --> 4420.28
tension heaps up it's just not inflamed

4417.52 --> 4423.400000000001
anymore like it

4420.28 --> 4425.44
was so whatever was happening there it

4423.4 --> 4428.638999999999
has been resolved it feels it has been

4425.44 --> 4428.638999999999
resolved it feels more

4430.48 --> 4438.4
complete thought you said naughty

4432.84 --> 4438.400000000001
shoulder what no no my shoulder's not

4442.32 --> 4445.99
[Music]

4446.96 --> 4451.96
naughty they made a parody movie of the

4449.48 --> 4453.839999999999
Titanic I think there are parody movies

4451.96 --> 4455.92
of the Titanic

4453.84 --> 4458.2390000000005
duper I think they're out there they're

4455.92 --> 4460.56
just not Hollywood movies or something

4458.239 --> 4460.5599999999995
or

4461.639 --> 4465.88
famous but uh

4463.92 --> 4467.4400000000005
yeah I mean the Titanic is kind of a

4465.88 --> 4470.639
shitty movie why were why are you

4467.44 --> 4470.638999999999
thinking about it about

4474.92 --> 4482.04
it like the only thing I was like even

4479.44 --> 4484.08
knowing about Titanic was that it seemed

4482.04 --> 4485.679
to be very popular with the girls and I

4484.08 --> 4487.159
was thinking like maybe I could find a

4485.679 --> 4489.1990000000005
girl and watch Titanic with her and then

4487.159 --> 4491.92
have sex with her like and that's like

4489.199 --> 4494.48
the only thing that was like even

4491.92 --> 4496.56
allowing the word Titan tanic in my mind

4494.48 --> 4499.28
was like that potential opportunity

4496.56 --> 4501.6
because it was so popular apparently

4499.28 --> 4501.599999999999
with the

4504.12 --> 4510.679
girls so I thought I didn't really do

4508.199 --> 4514.879999999999
research back

4510.679 --> 4519.719
then hey seing star water good to see

4514.88 --> 4519.719
you Gavin B hello

4520.639 --> 4527.76
what yeah I thought so too like there a

4523.52 --> 4527.76
lot of parodies on the Titanic it's

4528.239 --> 4532.199
everywhere it's just not Hollywood

4530.4 --> 4535.199
movies and

4532.199 --> 4535.199
[ __ ]

4536.6 --> 4543.639
H or naughty

4539.6 --> 4547.0
yeah yeah I I don't know uh how do you

4543.639 --> 4548.639
call that when is something is in a

4547.0 --> 4550.88
knot

4548.639 --> 4554.4800000000005
entangled but that's not really what it

4550.88 --> 4557.2390000000005
is it's like entangled but stuck

4554.48 --> 4560.759999999999
in a KN is it just that is it just do

4557.239 --> 4565.36
you just say in a KN and that's it I

4560.76 --> 4565.360000000001
don't know how to describe it that

4565.679 --> 4569.96
state in which your muscles can

4573.639 --> 4579.159000000001
be or just say cramped or something

4576.52 --> 4583.52
naughty is yeah but it is confusing

4579.159 --> 4586.199
though it is easy to misinterpret in a

4583.52 --> 4588.4800000000005
way that I don't like I don't want

4586.199 --> 4591.04
people to think naughty or something has

4588.48 --> 4592.919999999999
nothing to do with

4591.04 --> 4596.5199999999995
it all right I'm going to get my

4592.92 --> 4596.52
Illuminati on be right

4612.08 --> 4615.08
back

4642.0 --> 4647.36
o I'm kind of

4644.84 --> 4649.52
hungry and technically it's also better

4647.36 --> 4652.839999999999
for me to actually eat

4649.52 --> 4655.639
something solid before I put coffee in

4652.84 --> 4657.679
me so I didn't do that this time I

4655.639 --> 4660.0
should I should do that it's better for

4657.679 --> 4663.159
me because it's just the sugar makes too

4660.0 --> 4665.76
much impact that way should have

4663.159 --> 4669.04
something different in my system before

4665.76 --> 4672.0
I the coffee enters but anyway here look

4669.04 --> 4674.96
at this isn't that beautiful

4672.0 --> 4676.239
cheers

4674.96 --> 4678.76
I love it when they're just like

4676.239 --> 4678.759999999999
properly

4679.199 --> 4686.239
shaped sometimes they get a bit

4682.84 --> 4691.04
clunky anyway

4686.239 --> 4691.04
cheers ah [ __ ] it's too hot never

4694.0 --> 4698.84
mind I have to refresh to see comments

4698.96 --> 4703.8
what wow that's

4701.92 --> 4705.159
annoying

4703.8 --> 4706.4800000000005
[Music]

4705.159 --> 4709.28
let me try

4706.48 --> 4710.799999999999
that earlier I needed to refresh too it

4709.28 --> 4713.0
seemed like nobody was commenting but

4710.8 --> 4713.0
they

4722.88 --> 4726.639
were V length

4731.92 --> 4734.92
parody

4735.12 --> 4741.199
right but I mean duper I think

4737.52 --> 4745.92
that a full length parody movie I think

4741.199 --> 4749.879999999999
it's just not interesting

4745.92 --> 4749.88
enough for them to do

4751.8 --> 4756.76
that like how the hell are you going to

4754.48 --> 4759.239
make that entertaining enough you

4756.76 --> 4761.320000000001
know and like you're not going to get

4759.239 --> 4764.799999999999
the

4761.32 --> 4767.32
stars for those movie so it's not really

4764.8 --> 4770.4400000000005
going to work right I

4767.32 --> 4772.759999999999
mean if they done that at the time like

4770.44 --> 4775.199
took Leonardo Dicaprio and all the other

4772.76 --> 4777.52
actors when they're at that age and then

4775.199 --> 4780.08
said like hey you want to do this again

4777.52 --> 4781.4400000000005
and now we do the parody version then it

4780.08 --> 4785.36
would have really

4781.44 --> 4788.08
worked cuz it would be a proper parody

4785.36 --> 4788.08
but they didn't do

4791.84 --> 4796.08
it

4794.32 --> 4797.88
right so now it's going to have to be a

4796.08 --> 4800.36
remake and like how are you going to

4797.88 --> 4802.32
make that Standalone interesting enough

4800.36 --> 4806.0
it's like not

4802.32 --> 4809.08
really unless you want to unleash the

4806.0 --> 4811.36
conspiracy theorists on the entire thing

4809.08 --> 4812.8
and like emphasize like oh yeah oh yeah

4811.36 --> 4816.04
did you know that all the Federal

4812.8 --> 4818.159000000001
Reserve people that that opposed the red

4816.04 --> 4820.92
Reserve Act were on this boat oh did

4818.159 --> 4820.92
anybody tell you

4821.76 --> 4826.09
that

4823.03 --> 4826.09
[Music]

4829.84 --> 4834.12
and then they might be able to kind of

4832.239 --> 4836.159
make it interesting enough then they

4834.12 --> 4839.44
could have like

4836.159 --> 4842.799999999999
yeah it's a story about The Rance but

4839.44 --> 4845.36
it's really clunky and weird and silly

4842.8 --> 4847.2390000000005
and it's actually also conspiracy in the

4845.36 --> 4850.0
background that you get shoved in your

4847.239 --> 4852.239
face and then those people that are the

4850.0 --> 4855.0
main cast are just really stupid about

4852.239 --> 4858.04
it and that ends in like she throws the

4855.0 --> 4860.96
ring in the ocean and then drops off the

4858.04 --> 4862.679
boat into the ocean and that's it and

4860.96 --> 4867.96
then it would kind of

4862.679 --> 4867.96
work it be still a really weird movie

4869.79 --> 4874.6
[Music]

4871.92 --> 4877.28
though maybe you could like make like a

4874.6 --> 4879.88
Pixar cartoon movie out of it that would

4877.28 --> 4882.199
probably be

4879.88 --> 4885.36
easier than you could even make them

4882.199 --> 4888.36
look exactly like the actors looked back

4885.36 --> 4891.12
then cuz I mean they're a lot older now

4888.36 --> 4893.44
I don't why am I taking dupers idea so

4891.12 --> 4893.44
damn

4900.679 --> 4905.56
serious a sequel to Titanic that's

4907.13 --> 4910.209
[Music]

4911.639 --> 4914.639
interesting

4916.38 --> 4919.51
[Music]

4920.08 --> 4924.08
golum would be in a Lifeboat catching

4922.12 --> 4929.44
the ring that

4924.08 --> 4929.44
is that is good I like

4935.36 --> 4939.12
that I like that

4939.56 --> 4947.6
one yeah so she throws the ring and then

4943.12 --> 4950.599999999999
he's like ha I got my presses and she's

4947.6 --> 4953.0
like what what and she falls in the

4950.6 --> 4955.360000000001
water plch yeah that would be the

4953.0 --> 4955.36
perfect

4971.56 --> 4976.120000000001
ending you spent your most of your time

4974.12 --> 4978.76
on flat

4976.12 --> 4983.239
SIDS

4978.76 --> 4985.52
why you like sitting in in troll [ __ ]

4983.239 --> 4985.5199999999995
hole

4988.6 --> 4994.679
dungeons you like to go through the

4991.96 --> 4996.46
underbelly of Mount Moria after the

4994.679 --> 5001.4800000000005
dwarves were

4996.46 --> 5003.56
[Music]

5001.48 --> 5006.12
defeated

5003.56 --> 5007.639
but uh yeah now what happened is like I

5006.12 --> 5010.36
was sort of

5007.639 --> 5013.719
like there was a Fallout and I'm going

5010.36 --> 5017.36
my separate way it's like

5013.719 --> 5020.6
Nathan was just criticizing what I do

5017.36 --> 5022.28
what I bring to FD and said oh that's

5020.6 --> 5024.719
not we're not supposed to do that

5022.28 --> 5027.28
anymore he basically just like

5024.719 --> 5030.12
everything that is uniquely my quality

5027.28 --> 5033.599999999999
that I brought to Fed he

5030.12 --> 5036.04
denounced and then the final drop that

5033.6 --> 5037.92
made the bucket spill was like oh yeah

5036.04 --> 5039.719
Arwin why do you always have to do this

5037.92 --> 5042.1990000000005
you're making me lose

5039.719 --> 5046.08
money you're bad for my channel and

5042.199 --> 5050.0
that's like okay bye-bye

5046.08 --> 5052.0
then yeah you want me back 500 bucks oh

5050.0 --> 5054.8
I ain't getting the 500

5052.0 --> 5057.0
bucks it's at 44 it's going to stay

5054.8 --> 5061.400000000001
there all these people like oh why don't

5057.0 --> 5065.639
you come back yeah well put money in the

5061.4 --> 5068.679
gifts and go then and nobody is only

5065.639 --> 5071.4400000000005
trolls seem to be throwing money in

5068.679 --> 5072.4800000000005
there just to make fun of the situation

5071.44 --> 5077.12
thus

5072.48 --> 5079.5599999999995
far yes so no nobody really wants me to

5077.12 --> 5082.32
go back to Fed if they did my gifts and

5079.56 --> 5084.84
go would be full now it isn't people

5082.32 --> 5087.5199999999995
don't even know I have one anymore

5084.84 --> 5091.360000000001
except for when trolls start yapping on

5087.52 --> 5094.360000000001
about it and how it so failed

5091.36 --> 5094.36
yeah

5095.239 --> 5101.4
not everything he says but it is okay

5098.76 --> 5103.400000000001
yeah well that's fine

5101.4 --> 5105.96
like

5103.4 --> 5107.879999999999
because half of the time you can't even

5105.96 --> 5109.96
tell what he is saying and then you're

5107.88 --> 5111.6
okay with it I mean if you don't

5109.96 --> 5113.28
understand what they're saying then what

5111.6 --> 5115.52
could be wrong about it

5113.28 --> 5121.04
right Gavin

5115.52 --> 5121.040000000001
B no I did not kick me from fed

5121.28 --> 5124.28
Gavin

5126.8 --> 5133.76
I left I left angry and I made a

5130.32 --> 5135.159
follow-up video in which I was very

5133.76 --> 5138.639
angry at

5135.159 --> 5143.199
Nathan and I made my terms says 500

5138.639 --> 5143.1990000000005
bucks or I'm out well guess what I'm

5146.0 --> 5151.28
out and everybody misses me so much and

5148.92 --> 5154.0
the panel misses me so much Nathan

5151.28 --> 5157.48
doesn't he hasn't even said hello in my

5154.0 --> 5161.08
chat one time since I left but neither

5157.48 --> 5162.599999999999
has anybody else from fed panel so I

5161.08 --> 5164.199
think they're all just like trying to

5162.6 --> 5166.1990000000005
forget about me or something I don't

5164.199 --> 5168.36
know what the hell is going on I just

5166.199 --> 5169.5599999999995
know I'm staying away and I'm doing it

5168.36 --> 5172.88
also as a

5169.56 --> 5174.88
test yeah like Nathan telling me hey

5172.88 --> 5176.76
you're making me lose money okay let's

5174.88 --> 5179.88
put that to the test yeah let's see how

5176.76 --> 5181.719
you fair with without me let's see how

5179.88 --> 5184.96
your finances are doing now and your

5181.719 --> 5190.4
support is doing so we can

5184.96 --> 5192.88
actually like put the test to that

5190.4 --> 5194.92
claim and I want to know I want to know

5192.88 --> 5198.6
how he's been

5194.92 --> 5200.96
doing and then see like oh was I really

5198.6 --> 5203.52
detri are you doing better Nathan now

5200.96 --> 5206.08
that I've left are you doing

5203.52 --> 5208.0
better is your support doing better are

5206.08 --> 5211.08
people more satisfied about your

5208.0 --> 5211.08
performance since I

5211.199 --> 5216.04
left

5213.08 --> 5219.0
right cuz the troll certainly ain't

5216.04 --> 5221.5199999999995
stopping with the complaining I can tell

5219.0 --> 5224.48
you that they're still complaining about

5221.52 --> 5226.88
me in the freaking fed chat even though

5224.48 --> 5229.159
I'm not even part of fed anymore

5226.88 --> 5231.52
actively there's still whining and

5229.159 --> 5234.5599999999995
complaining about me in their chat

5231.52 --> 5236.76
probably over at flat sides as well I

5234.56 --> 5239.52
don't even know why man I don't even

5236.76 --> 5239.52
know why they do

5241.119 --> 5244.119

5268.719 --> 5273.0
about Mandela all the time oh my God

5271.4 --> 5276.599999999999

pathetic yes reinforce people's

5279.44 --> 5286.799999999999
retardation somewh flat soid you do

5283.719 --> 5289.679
that no no no the world has changed it's

5286.8 --> 5293.0
not your mind that changed those things

5289.679 --> 5295.639
for the better inside your head Without

5293.0 --> 5297.92
You realizing it no it's the entire

5295.639 --> 5301.400000000001
world that Chang and now everything is a

5297.92 --> 5304.1990000000005
little bit more ugly for no damn reason

5301.4 --> 5306.08
and only things change towards ugly and

5304.199 --> 5308.119
never towards beautiful and that you

5306.08 --> 5309.719
remember the ugly version and it's not

5308.119 --> 5313.4
there and like no that's not how the

5309.719 --> 5316.4800000000005
Mandela effect effect works

5313.4 --> 5318.719
ever you're only disturbed by the

5316.48 --> 5320.959999999999
ugliness the things that shouldn't be

5318.719 --> 5324.28
that way it's never the other way around

5320.96 --> 5325.56
like hey I remember this to be this ugly

5324.28 --> 5329.119
clunky

5325.56 --> 5331.0
thing and now it's all great and it was

5329.119 --> 5335.48
always great how can that

5331.0 --> 5338.719
be no that's not how people remember

5335.48 --> 5341.5599999999995
anything it's only things that in your

5338.719 --> 5343.52
mind were better than they actually were

5341.56 --> 5346.159000000001
in reality they weren't like that and

5343.52 --> 5348.679
now you're really frustrated because you

5346.159 --> 5352.08
really thought it was better like you

5348.679 --> 5355.4
remember it in your mind but that

5352.08 --> 5358.5199999999995
memory is an aesthetic

5355.4 --> 5361.08
reconstruction of your mind while you

5358.52 --> 5362.639
were live watching it it is your

5361.08 --> 5365.119
internal ver

5362.639 --> 5368.96
that you're reflecting upon not the

5365.119 --> 5368.96
actual thing that you

5369.48 --> 5374.44
perceived the internal reconstruction

5372.76 --> 5376.6
that you're reflecting upon the

5374.44 --> 5380.44
aesthetic mind creating

5376.6 --> 5383.0
it and it does so similar with everybody

5380.44 --> 5384.48
everybody follows the same patterns when

5383.0 --> 5387.199
doing

5384.48 --> 5389.799999999999
that yeah there's nobody saying like

5387.199 --> 5393.5199999999995
what what do you mean Baron stain Bears

5389.8 --> 5395.84
it should be Baron Stone Bears damn it

5393.52 --> 5400.119000000001
why isn't it Baron Stone Bears no it's

5395.84 --> 5402.32
Baron Steen Bears no it's Baron Stone no

5400.119 --> 5404.639
everybody thinks it should be Baron

5402.32 --> 5406.799999999999
stein bears and it's Baron stain Bears

5404.639 --> 5410.1990000000005
yeah nobody says yeah no I thought it

5406.8 --> 5411.719
was Baron Stone Bears no nobody says

5410.199 --> 5414.36
that

5411.719 --> 5416.119
why because that makes no sense to the

5414.36 --> 5418.639
aesthetic mind which is universal in

5416.119 --> 5418.639
everybody's

5420.52 --> 5426.52
mind yeah there's no fragmented Mandela

5424.6 --> 5428.2390000000005
effect like hey I thought it was

5426.52 --> 5429.84
completely different it was why isn't it

5428.239 --> 5432.959999999999
Baron Stone

5429.84 --> 5436.719
Bears No it should be Baron stein bears

5432.96 --> 5439.76
but it's Baron steain Bears no it's

5436.719 --> 5441.0
only one version that it's supposedly

5439.76 --> 5444.679
supposed to

5441.0 --> 5446.92
be and this version that it is is never

5444.679 --> 5450.4400000000005
alternative thoughts on like how it's

5446.92 --> 5452.4800000000005
supposed to be it's always one

5450.44 --> 5455.799999999999
way h

5452.48 --> 5458.48
anybody pick up on

5455.8 --> 5460.8
that I mean that's a pattern that's the

5458.48 --> 5462.959999999999
things I look at yeah everybody oh this

5460.8 --> 5465.0
and that this oh guess what I'm looking

5462.96 --> 5469.159
not at this and that this and that I'm

5465.0 --> 5473.679
looking at the pattern of it and then

5469.159 --> 5475.92
perceiving that yeah I look in between

5473.679 --> 5478.1990000000005
where you really get to figure out what

5475.92 --> 5478.1990000000005
things

5480.76 --> 5483.76
are

5485.82 --> 5490.84
[Music]

5488.56 --> 5493.639
what a whole lot of floid subscribers

5490.84 --> 5496.08
got banned okay how did that happen

5493.639 --> 5497.52
Gavin B did somebody just go on a wild

5496.08 --> 5501.08
Banning spree or

5497.52 --> 5503.2390000000005
something I mean flatso's absolutely

5501.08 --> 5504.6
atrocious when it comes out to handing

5503.239 --> 5507.48
out

5504.6 --> 5510.400000000001
ranches you literally gave out wrenches

5507.48 --> 5513.08
to to overt mental

5510.4 --> 5517.719
patients and people people told him that

5513.08 --> 5517.719
and he ignored it like a [ __ ]

5521.0 --> 5528.679
nutcase so I'm not surprised at

5524.92 --> 5531.159
all right I mean just sprinkle some more

5528.679 --> 5534.0
chaos and then people will be busy right

5531.159 --> 5536.5599999999995
if you don't have actual input to

5534.0 --> 5538.199
continually give out yeah just create

5536.56 --> 5542.159000000001
chaos and everybody will be talking

5538.199 --> 5544.28
about that right flat soid that's why I

5542.159 --> 5547.48
don't follow his channel anymore it's a

5544.28 --> 5550.08
[ __ ] waste of time all of it he

5547.48 --> 5553.48
doesn't actually develop

5550.08 --> 5556.159
ideas where's your idea flat soid

5553.48 --> 5559.119
where's your idea what did you come up

5556.159 --> 5561.879999999999
with

5559.119 --> 5563.04
yeah have you figured out the nature of

5561.88 --> 5565.92
light

5563.04 --> 5569.119
yet do you know what these celestials

5565.92 --> 5571.119
are do you know what the orientation of

5569.119 --> 5573.639
the land masses within the known Earth

5571.119 --> 5573.639
realm is

5574.96 --> 5579.4
right you know about the nature of

5576.92 --> 5581.4
physics and how gas doesn't have mass

5579.4 --> 5585.0
and all

5581.4 --> 5586.96
that maybe you figured out a way to test

5585.0 --> 5589.199
whether Moonlight is cold or not

5586.96 --> 5593.52
scientifically like I have oh wait no

5589.199 --> 5593.5199999999995

never going to that [ __ ]

5609.04 --> 5616.639

5612.6 --> 5618.56
bring my glorious personal contributions

5616.639 --> 5620.4400000000005
and take them over to the [ __ ] hole

5618.56 --> 5623.400000000001
where they're definitely not going to be

5620.44 --> 5625.599999999999
appreciated going to be talked down to

5623.4 --> 5627.92
or ignored and then a whole bunch of

5625.6 --> 5630.4400000000005
trolls that typically hang out there are

5627.92 --> 5633.04
just going to spout their [ __ ] over and

5630.44 --> 5635.5599999999995
over again why why the [ __ ] would I go

5633.04 --> 5640.44
there it makes more sense to go on a

5635.56 --> 5640.4400000000005
mekun stream and that's not an

5653.04 --> 5657.4
exaggeration besides I'd like to have

5655.119 --> 5659.88
conversations with people that are

5657.4 --> 5663.48
intelligible where you can actually tell

5659.88 --> 5663.4800000000005
what they're talking about

5669.44 --> 5675.239
and they don't automatically play on

5672.52 --> 5678.159000000001
their own in unintelligibility by

5675.239 --> 5681.04
literally becoming slightly

5678.159 --> 5682.759999999999
unintelligible and then basically making

5681.04 --> 5685.5199999999995
people stop inquiring because they're

5682.76 --> 5688.08
embarrassed because they don't exactly

5685.52 --> 5690.4800000000005
know what he was talking about and floid

5688.08 --> 5694.44
knew that so he literally becomes

5690.48 --> 5699.119
unintelligible just to avoid a question

5694.44 --> 5699.119
yeah I'm not playing those games

5701.159 --> 5704.96
guys you think flatte is an intelligible

5704.08 --> 5706.8
he

5704.96 --> 5710.0
is

5706.8 --> 5714.56
bro are you saying you can like follow

5710.0 --> 5714.56
everything that he's talking about I

5714.96 --> 5724.36
can't I recognize certain words but I

5718.8 --> 5728.56
mean I think i' understand a properly

5724.36 --> 5728.5599999999995
fully German talking person

5729.4 --> 5734.0
better if they're not sloppy right

5732.48 --> 5736.599999999999
because that's what it's all about it's

5734.0 --> 5737.88
about how sloppy are you going to be the

5736.6 --> 5741.119000000001
more sloppy you are the more

5737.88 --> 5741.119
unintelligible it

5743.85 --> 5749.2390000000005
[Music]

5746.0 --> 5751.92
becomes okay thanks for that he he I

5749.239 --> 5753.759999999999
don't know what why intelligence really

5751.92 --> 5757.52
had would have anything to do with

5753.76 --> 5757.52
whether I would debate flat soid or

5759.239 --> 5766.08
not yeah I

5761.96 --> 5769.44
mean I would probably talk and have a

5766.08 --> 5773.119
discussion with a official clinical

5769.44 --> 5777.719
[ __ ] if they're just not freaking

5773.119 --> 5779.08
belligerent yeah I can adapt to people's

5777.719 --> 5782.719
mind

5779.08 --> 5784.679
structures what I don't adapt to how is

5782.719 --> 5788.8
mind structures that are accompanied by

5784.679 --> 5794.04
a whole plora of trashy

5788.8 --> 5794.04

5886.52 --> 5891.4800000000005
be possible but there's just no way you

5888.48 --> 5893.718999999999
could ever actually prove it you can

5891.48 --> 5897.28
only convince people and it's a waste of

unprovable waste of

though for an alternative route that

5919.719 --> 5925.56
actually explains what

5922.36 --> 5928.32
happens it doesn't claim some mystical

say that she did something

6094.32 --> 6100.5599999999995
wrong like why the [ __ ] is she still

6097.88 --> 6100.56
around

6103.48 --> 6107.0
there I don't get

6108.44 --> 6112.45
[Music]

6109.84 --> 6116.31
it

6112.45 --> 6116.3099999999995
[Music]

6120.76 --> 6126.04
yeah steepen I just explained it she has

6122.719 --> 6128.8
me blocked because I she can't stand me

6126.04 --> 6131.56
she's like I am a repulsive evil

6128.8 --> 6133.4800000000005
individual I don't even know exactly if

6131.56 --> 6138.400000000001
she even allow she just got me blocked

6133.48 --> 6142.718999999999
she can't handle me because I don't see

6138.4 --> 6146.36
her like the [ __ ] female pope of Flat

6142.719 --> 6147.199
Earth yeah I don't have default respect

6146.36 --> 6151.119
for

6147.199 --> 6152.32
her and her preponderance of works I

6151.119 --> 6154.119
have

6152.32 --> 6157.08
fundamental

6154.119 --> 6161.0
criticism about everything she does and

6157.08 --> 6161.0
she's always ignored

6161.719 --> 6166.639
it it's like

6164.0 --> 6170.08
diametrically ignored it like did

6166.639 --> 6172.4400000000005
exactly the opposite and reinforced that

6170.08 --> 6174.4
yeah that's what she's done and like

6172.44 --> 6177.28
from the freaking

6174.4 --> 6179.119
beginning this started years ago like

6177.28 --> 6181.44
half a decade

6179.119 --> 6183.839999999999
ago

6181.44 --> 6187.28
right and I think it also has something

6183.84 --> 6190.719
to do with that she's kind of a freaking

6187.28 --> 6192.88
feminist and she's hiding that yeah she

6190.719 --> 6198.0
is like that she's actually kind of an

6192.88 --> 6201.1990000000005
sjw feminist that's just trying to take

6198.0 --> 6203.119
over because that's what they do

6201.199 --> 6206.719
yeah

6203.119 --> 6210.639
they get in there they

6206.719 --> 6213.199
normalize the Beast system Trinkets and

6210.639 --> 6215.1990000000005
traits like feminism or whatever like oh

6213.199 --> 6218.96
no I just have this opinion yeah you're

6215.199 --> 6221.04
going to force that opinion yeah going

6218.96 --> 6223.679
to structure everything you teach based

6221.04 --> 6227.159
on that slight personal alteration

6223.679 --> 6229.92
aren't you yeah and then everybody gets

6227.159 --> 6234.45
used to it yes it's just another 401K

6229.92 --> 6237.55
Church except she's doing it her version

6234.45 --> 6237.55
[Music]

6245.119 --> 6250.08
yeah yeah yeah female pope of Flat Earth

6248.52 --> 6252.76
yeah it is Rel laughable but that's

6250.08 --> 6254.96
exactly how she's acting and that's how

6252.76 --> 6259.599
she wants to be treated she wants people

6254.96 --> 6261.28
to rever her and listen to her

6259.599 --> 6266.1990000000005
elaborate

6261.28 --> 6268.639
wisdom supposedly based on very harsh

6266.199 --> 6270.73
and strict presuppositions that are

6268.639 --> 6273.08
absolutely

6270.73 --> 6276.32
[Music]

6273.08 --> 6280.8
nonsense what's a 401k Church what you

6276.32 --> 6280.799999999999
don't know that see me

6286.92 --> 6291.56
serious can't believe you were banned

6289.56 --> 6293.88
well with a name like that that that's

6291.56 --> 6296.52
not surprising at all yeah Jesus from

6293.88 --> 6298.52
outer space it's not funny your name is

6296.52 --> 6300.400000000001
not funny it's blatant ridicule if you

6298.52 --> 6303.92
have Jesus in your

6300.4 --> 6307.0
name you're a piece of [ __ ] yeah don't

6303.92 --> 6311.159
ridicule Jesus I have a lot of respect

6307.0 --> 6315.159
for Jesus I just don't think he's

6311.159 --> 6317.96
God yeah because when you do you violate

6315.159 --> 6321.199
the ground rules of the very [ __ ]

6317.96 --> 6325.52
book you believe in like a good

6321.199 --> 6328.239
Antichrist Satanist does yeah yeah oh

6325.52 --> 6330.1990000000005
all these rules oh he is God but I'm not

6328.239 --> 6332.48
going to listen to God we're not going

6330.199 --> 6334.96
to do what he says but I'm going to

6332.48 --> 6339.759999999999
worship him because that's what we're

6334.96 --> 6339.76
not supposed to do eh

6345.239 --> 6350.678999999999
yes just make up more [ __ ] that

6348.199 --> 6353.159
contradicts everything that he taught

6350.679 --> 6355.56
can spend a lifetime doing that and

6353.159 --> 6355.5599999999995
people

6359.32 --> 6363.08
do Jesus is a common first name in yeah

6362.28 --> 6366.92
it's

6363.08 --> 6366.92
Hispanic Spain

6371.36 --> 6377.759999999999
Jesus gez change your name no

6378.44 --> 6384.799999999999
no he's obviously saying it to ridicule

6382.119 --> 6386.759999999999
Jesus but he's probably doing it because

6384.8 --> 6390.2390000000005
he wants to

6386.76 --> 6394.280000000001
ridicule this Antichrist Christianity

6390.239 --> 6397.28
that is prevalent throughout the entire

6394.28 --> 6397.28
world

6399.88 --> 6405.84
yeah like I did when I was younger I

6403.52 --> 6410.159000000001
immediately recognized like the church

6405.84 --> 6412.56
is the Antichrist it's just couldn't be

6410.159 --> 6414.96
more more

6412.56 --> 6417.4400000000005
blatant as soon as I saw what they were

6414.96 --> 6420.599
doing she just like yeah that's the

6417.44 --> 6423.239
Antichrist I mean how could you not see

6420.599 --> 6423.2390000000005
it

6424.56 --> 6432.76
Christians and like how could you

6427.639 --> 6436.119
not just do exactly the opposite like

6432.76 --> 6439.679
not like oh well we don't like the way

6436.119 --> 6441.04
they're acting so we're going to protest

6439.679 --> 6444.4
we're going to Pro protest we're going

6441.04 --> 6448.76
to be Protestants and do it slightly

6444.4 --> 6452.28
different but still the same yes we just

6448.76 --> 6453.8
want our version of the Antichrist

6452.28 --> 6456.199
Christianity yeah that's what they all

6453.8 --> 6459.159000000001
did no no they're they're bad they're

6456.199 --> 6462.879999999999
the bad Church let's do it right let's

6459.159 --> 6465.28
make our form of antichrist

6462.88 --> 6468.88
Christianity where we are going to do

6465.28 --> 6472.199
exactly the same fundamental incorrect

6468.88 --> 6475.04
things and in incorrect assumptions but

6472.199 --> 6476.759999999999
with a slight twist so we are better

6475.04 --> 6480.239
than

6476.76 --> 6482.88
them yeah that's what they've all done

6480.239 --> 6485.879999999999
it's all Antichrist Christianity none of

6482.88 --> 6485.88
them actually get

6485.96 --> 6491.639
it yeah the original

6489.52 --> 6494.360000000001
Christianity was completely

6491.639 --> 6498.56
decentralized and it was

6494.36 --> 6501.679
exterminated as hinted at in the very

6498.56 --> 6504.56
book that you're reading yeah by the guy

6501.679 --> 6506.159
that reformed Christianity I mean it's

6504.56 --> 6509.080000000001
just only just

6506.159 --> 6512.0
trying trying to reform trying to be

6509.08 --> 6514.96
good boy I saw Jesus I it's really him

6512.0 --> 6517.92
and he told me that well you you things

6514.96 --> 6521.4
are slightly different it's slightly

6517.92 --> 6523.84
different as what I told you in life and

6521.4 --> 6529.199
so I'm here I'm here to communicate

6523.84 --> 6530.96
Jesus yes really I'm the I'm the real

6529.199 --> 6534.598999999999
Christianity

6530.96 --> 6534.599
yeah your great

6534.84 --> 6541.4800000000005
hero Apostle Paul who never met Jesus

6538.56 --> 6543.8
except in a vision where Jesus told him

6541.48 --> 6546.28
that everything was slightly

6543.8 --> 6549.679
different than what he was teaching when

6546.28 --> 6553.44
he was alive because I mean he was only

6549.679 --> 6554.92
mistaken right even though he is God he

6553.44 --> 6557.919999999999
can ever be

6554.92 --> 6557.92
wrong

6558.4 --> 6568.239
right yeah so that's

6562.44 --> 6568.239
[Music]

6578.76 --> 6584.119000000001
right okay fair enough steamy I

6582.19 --> 6588.5599999999995
[Music]

6584.119 --> 6588.5599999999995
will just let me finish chewing

6589.119 --> 6592.119
this

6592.15 --> 6602.33
[Music]

6604.84 --> 6611.92
right but yeah what is the 401K the

6609.04 --> 6615.639
401K is the system in the United States

6611.92 --> 6618.639
it's it's the tax exemption

6615.639 --> 6622.159000000001
system for

6618.639 --> 6624.76
churches it's BAS basically a hook from

6622.159 --> 6628.36
the government into the

6624.76 --> 6630.76
church and like you just have to do what

6628.36 --> 6633.48
they tell you to do and then you can

6630.76 --> 6635.84
stay tax exempt then you don't have to

6633.48 --> 6639.799999999999
pay taxes of the income that you get in

6635.84 --> 6643.679
the church that's a

6639.8 --> 6648.159000000001
401k it's used a lot in the United

6643.679 --> 6649.88
States and all those disgusting 401K

6648.159 --> 6650.638999999999
churches guess what happened to all of

6649.88 --> 6651.96
them

6650.639 --> 6656.4800000000005
yeah they're

6651.96 --> 6659.719
all they all wave flags of the current

6656.48 --> 6661.28
thing they're all [ __ ] become Pro

6659.719 --> 6665.599
LGBT

6661.28 --> 6667.719
crap yeah they basically become overt

6665.599 --> 6670.1990000000005
Antichrist

6667.719 --> 6672.56
churches where literally everything is

6670.199 --> 6672.5599999999995
turned

6673.079 --> 6676.079
around

6678.96 --> 6681.96
yeah

6683.92 --> 6692.76
501 C3 40 oh oh you're right sorry sorry

6689.719 --> 6697.88
I mixed it up I'm so sorry you're right

6692.76 --> 6699.88
it's a 501c3 yes ah okay to be fair

6697.88 --> 6702.719
though I am terrible when it comes to

6699.88 --> 6706.599
like tax knowledge and all yes I mix

6702.719 --> 6709.56
them up that's the one yeah 401K is a

6706.599 --> 6711.84
retirement although that's also screwed

6709.56 --> 6714.84
for most people right

6711.84 --> 6718.32
now but yes it's separate you're right

6714.84 --> 6720.8
it's the 501c3 I mixed them up I'm sorry

6718.32 --> 6724.0
it's good that you're telling me that

6720.8 --> 6724.0
because I wouldn't have noticed

6725.56 --> 6732.4400000000005
that right but that is yeah that's the

6729.28 --> 6734.96
thing I was talking about 501c3 I just

6732.44 --> 6734.96
mixed it

6738.88 --> 6741.88
up

6747.36 --> 6753.679
y yeah exactly Gavin B

6751.159 --> 6756.719
yeah had to do their tax exemption for

6753.679 --> 6760.079
supporting a political party unless it

6756.719 --> 6761.92
would have been Biden right then they're

6760.079 --> 6763.5599999999995
not going to bother you like yeah you're

6761.92 --> 6765.0
not supposed to do that but yeah we're

6763.56 --> 6768.679
just not going to do anything about it

6765.0 --> 6771.04
because we are in power and we can wield

6768.679 --> 6773.28
that power tot toally hypocritical in

6771.04 --> 6774.04
her own favor what are you going to do

6773.28 --> 6775.719
about

6774.04 --> 6778.28
it

6775.719 --> 6781.92
well go with the flow and get all the

6778.28 --> 6785.5199999999995
money like a good Antichrist

6781.92 --> 6790.92
Satanist or resist us and be poor and

6785.52 --> 6790.92
actually try to be real Christians and

6791.199 --> 6794.678999999999
yeah that ain't

6795.0 --> 6800.04
happening people ain't doing that

6797.76 --> 6803.88
because actually being a Christian and

6800.04 --> 6806.92
like choosing consciously to be poor and

6803.88 --> 6810.28
not get all the advantages for money

6806.92 --> 6812.639
just for Christ and for the truth yeah

6810.28 --> 6817.079
just Americans just don't do

6812.639 --> 6821.32
that they're too dependent on their

6817.079 --> 6824.5599999999995
luxuries to choose poverty and

6821.32 --> 6828.759999999999
Truth over lies and money they just

6824.56 --> 6831.76
can't do it you're too

6828.76 --> 6831.76
Hellbound

6833.32 --> 6837.599
they don't do

6834.84 --> 6840.32
it except maybe the Amish I think that

6837.599 --> 6844.28
the amage are like

6840.32 --> 6848.4
probably the church type group that just

6844.28 --> 6851.079
doesn't do it they don't do the uh 501c3

6848.4 --> 6855.239
at all and they don't need

6851.079 --> 6855.239
to they just do everything

6858.679 --> 6861.679
internally

6870.32 --> 6876.32
yeah do Amish pay taxes yes of course

6874.159 --> 6879.549999999999
they

6876.32 --> 6879.549999999999
[Music]

6881.199 --> 6888.678999999999
do but not a lot because they don't

6884.88 --> 6891.1990000000005
really do Financial transactions that

6888.679 --> 6892.84
much

6891.199 --> 6895.4
because they do so much internally and

6892.84 --> 6898.599
when you do everything

6895.4 --> 6901.44
internally you buy and sell internally

6898.599 --> 6903.599
then it's just none of the tax systems

6901.44 --> 6908.678999999999
business you don't have to pay taxes

6903.599 --> 6908.679
then if you have a community that trades

6909.28 --> 6915.639
internally that's completely

6913.0 --> 6917.88
legal but if you're really dependent on

6915.639 --> 6920.639
the outside world for your trade and

6917.88 --> 6923.4400000000005
your resources and everything yeah then

6920.639 --> 6924.96
you're going to pay a lot more taxes if

6923.44 --> 6926.32
you don't have tax exemption but if

6924.96 --> 6930.639
you're really

6926.32 --> 6935.239
self-sufficient then you are not so much

6930.639 --> 6935.2390000000005
dependent on those tax exemption

6943.36 --> 6949.4
systems right Ste Trav

6946.76 --> 6951.1990000000005
exactly they are they still have to pay

6949.4 --> 6953.32
tax taxes they

6951.199 --> 6955.5199999999995
just they're not just going to throw

6953.32 --> 6958.48
their money away they're going to have

6955.52 --> 6960.92
they have their own tax guys like the

6958.48 --> 6964.159
Amish have their own Jews basically they

6960.92 --> 6966.079
know they're not St Amish are smart guys

6964.159 --> 6968.799999999999
they're not

6966.079 --> 6970.88
dumb that's like the worst misconception

6968.8 --> 6972.679
of like the modernist person is that the

6970.88 --> 6977.84
Amish are so oldfashioned they must be

6972.679 --> 6977.84
dumb no oh my God no they're not

6978.199 --> 6984.0
dumb they just don't get carried away

6981.119 --> 6984.0
with modernist

6988.599 --> 6996.119000000001
crap right so they are smart with taxes

6992.96 --> 6999.56
and the best way to fix all these taxes

6996.119 --> 6999.5599999999995
is by working it out

7005.36 --> 7011.5199999999995
internally yeah I mean you could like if

7008.52 --> 7014.119000000001
you're just working with a favor system

7011.52 --> 7017.84
right like hey you do me a favor I'll do

7014.119 --> 7020.44
you a favor yeah favors don't have tax

7017.84 --> 7022.04
yeah you don't pay taxes over favors

7020.44 --> 7024.839999999999
yeah that doesn't work because it's a

7022.04 --> 7026.36
favor doesn't have a numerical

7024.84 --> 7028.96
value

7026.36 --> 7031.96
yeah that's how you do it internally

7028.96 --> 7034.36
it's just a favor based system it's

7031.96 --> 7037.28
probably has a register even with some

7034.36 --> 7038.719
people it's like yeah I I need a favor

7037.28 --> 7040.199
in the future so I'm going to help you

7038.719 --> 7044.88
out a lot for

7040.199 --> 7046.879999999999
free will you do it yes okay he's not

7044.88 --> 7051.400000000001
going to have to pay

7046.88 --> 7056.4800000000005
taxes over doing that over that

7051.4 --> 7056.48
labor right and that's all perfectly

7065.599 --> 7070.599
legal right no social security tax

7068.56 --> 7073.320000000001
because they have their own system they

7070.599 --> 7073.32
take care of their

7073.599 --> 7079.88
own like a barter system yeah pretty

7076.199 --> 7082.48
much and barter is legal you don't have

7079.88 --> 7085.04
to pay taxes over barter that's just

7082.48 --> 7088.199
that's logical that's standard taxes

7085.04 --> 7092.0
only work when

7088.199 --> 7094.799999999999
the systems money is

7092.0 --> 7097.199
involved if you deal with the money of

7094.8 --> 7100.119000000001
the bank of the state that's where the

7097.199 --> 7103.199
tax comes in if you're just trading

7100.119 --> 7105.48
stuff or exchanging

7103.199 --> 7108.48
Services they can't tax it because

7105.48 --> 7108.48
you're not using their

7113.88 --> 7119.1990000000005
currency many times felt like I wanted

7116.52 --> 7123.119000000001
to live in a syst yes but you can to a

7119.199 --> 7123.119
degree just make a system like

7123.32 --> 7128.4
that all you have to do is just decide

7126.119 --> 7130.4
like I'm just going to do these things

7128.4 --> 7131.44
for free

7130.4 --> 7135.839999999999
and

7131.44 --> 7137.5199999999995
then hopefully more people will do that

7135.84 --> 7139.28
and they will know like how that guy

7137.52 --> 7143.079000000001
actually gave that for free I'll give

7139.28 --> 7143.079
him a favor when he needs it

7143.119 --> 7150.119
right I partially do

7146.88 --> 7152.599
that I'm giving all my ideas out for

7150.119 --> 7154.679
free I'm not like oh this is a really

7152.599 --> 7156.8
good idea I need to write this down and

7154.679 --> 7160.2390000000005
contact a few Grabbers and then like try

7156.8 --> 7161.92
to negotiate some kind of sales price

7160.239 --> 7164.678999999999
out of it like no I'm just like no I'm

7161.92 --> 7164.679
throwing everything

7165.28 --> 7170.48
out but I do require Financial

7168.159 --> 7173.04
maintenance to be able to eat that's the

7170.48 --> 7175.0
other side of it and it shouldn't even

7173.04 --> 7179.079
be like that guys it shouldn't have to

7175.0 --> 7182.599
be like I'm on minimal social welfare

7179.079 --> 7182.599
you how dare you

7182.639 --> 7187.88
yeah

7184.44 --> 7190.199
and what that is is based on a

7187.88 --> 7192.28
constitutional law here it's on the

7190.199 --> 7194.4
Constitution the social welfare it is it

7192.28 --> 7195.88
has been for a long time like before I

7194.4 --> 7197.5599999999995
was

7195.88 --> 7204.119
born

7197.56 --> 7206.119000000001
and you should be able to survive on

7204.119 --> 7209.839999999999
that in this

7206.119 --> 7213.759999999999
country and it seems like that's not

7209.84 --> 7213.76
really all that doable

7215.92 --> 7222.4800000000005
anymore cuz if I didn't get support from

7219.4 --> 7225.48
you guys I wouldn't I wouldn't make

7222.48 --> 7229.5599999999995
it with that standard social welfare so

7225.48 --> 7232.32
it's a warning sign to me like uh it's

7229.56 --> 7234.4400000000005
not functioning anymore it's not working

7232.32 --> 7236.44
the way it's supposed to work the social

7234.44 --> 7240.759999999999
welfare is supposed to be based on like

7236.44 --> 7244.48
what you minimally need to just get

7240.76 --> 7246.76
around and not build more debt with a a

7244.48 --> 7249.48
basic life I mean a modest life you

7246.76 --> 7251.52
can't expect to like party every week on

7249.48 --> 7254.119
social welfare and that's a fact and I

7251.52 --> 7254.119000000001
accepted

7254.52 --> 7260.92
that well it's just not really working

7257.52 --> 7263.4800000000005
anymore because everything's become too

7260.92 --> 7266.4800000000005
expensive and it's it's a trend that's

7263.48 --> 7269.638999999999
been building for the last few years and

7266.48 --> 7273.28
I don't really know what to do with

7269.639 --> 7275.92
it except I need support and so again I

7273.28 --> 7278.48
ask please donate to my PayPal or become

7275.92 --> 7282.52
part of my patreon I really need the

7278.48 --> 7285.5599999999995
support I need it a lot and continually

7282.52 --> 7287.679
and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm always just

7285.56 --> 7290.4400000000005
trying to get

7287.679 --> 7293.1990000000005
money you just get a job okay well then

7290.44 --> 7295.799999999999
offer me that job yeah I see these

7293.199 --> 7297.719
trolls everywhere and every time I say

7295.8 --> 7299.2390000000005
this they just shut the hell up why did

7297.719 --> 7304.159
you get a

7299.239 --> 7308.04
job well uh because it's very terrible

7304.159 --> 7311.079
on me to try to do that and like

7308.04 --> 7314.04
causes just this terrible terrible state

7311.079 --> 7316.079
of mind and health risks and I don't

7314.04 --> 7319.079
want it I don't want to go mad trying to

7316.079 --> 7322.199
do that again and besides like I have a

7319.079 --> 7324.239
reputation now yeah that reputation is

7322.199 --> 7329.04
not convenient and then the troll says

7324.239 --> 7332.4
like yeah yeah yeah employees look at

7329.04 --> 7335.159
people's internet history now ha so so

7332.4 --> 7336.92
yeah give me the job then yeah right

7335.159 --> 7339.799999999999
because I'm going to look for a job well

7336.92 --> 7341.76
guess what I have a reputation yeah

7339.8 --> 7344.2390000000005
it's not going to be easy for me to get

7341.76 --> 7346.4400000000005
a job without being treated like an

7344.239 --> 7355.199
absolute piece of

7346.44 --> 7357.759999999999
trash so give me that job or shut the

7355.199 --> 7357.759999999999
[ __ ]

7359.679 --> 7365.679
up and that's how it is and I'm not

7363.04 --> 7367.96
going to go look for it because you want

7365.679 --> 7371.079
to keep complaining about

7367.96 --> 7373.159
it you give me that job or you shut the

7371.079 --> 7375.96
[ __ ] up I'm going to do this this is the

7373.159 --> 7378.0
only thing my show my Daily Show and

7375.96 --> 7380.96
it's not always great but it's the thing

7378.0 --> 7384.44
that has worked for me more than

7380.96 --> 7388.079
anything else I've ever tried in my

7384.44 --> 7390.48
life as a career so I'm going to keep

7388.079 --> 7393.28
doing that thing that has worked better

7390.48 --> 7395.959999999999
than anything else I've ever tried in my

7393.28 --> 7398.48
life and I got to keep doing that and if

7395.96 --> 7404.199
you don't think it's good enough well

7398.48 --> 7407.36
then give me another job

7404.199 --> 7410.36
then I'm not going to go look for it you

7407.36 --> 7413.04
will have to give it to me or shut the

7410.36 --> 7413.04
[ __ ] up about

7427.88 --> 7430.88
it

7431.04 --> 7435.639
in the

7432.079 --> 7437.44
USA federally funded benefits I don't

7435.639 --> 7439.84
get federally funded

7437.44 --> 7441.919999999999
benefits it's

7439.84 --> 7444.84
local the

7441.92 --> 7448.2390000000005
city the city is effectively paying for

7444.84 --> 7451.1990000000005
my welfare but I ask for the minimum

7448.239 --> 7455.159
yeah I'm specific about that you know

7451.199 --> 7457.719
why because I could literally just have

7455.159 --> 7459.679
myself analyze psychologically and then

7457.719 --> 7462.159
like oh look at what I got I got this

7459.679 --> 7465.119
and this and this I'm definitely

7462.159 --> 7467.879999999999
mentally not entirely capable of just

7465.119 --> 7470.679
functioning in a normal job yes and then

7467.88 --> 7474.28
I could get extra money for that

7470.679 --> 7476.52
alongside a whole trajectory where

7474.28 --> 7479.04
they're going to try to figure out how

7476.52 --> 7481.0
can we get this person to [ __ ]

7479.04 --> 7483.199
lobotomize

7481.0 --> 7486.36
themselves and

7483.199 --> 7489.719
die that's what you get when you start

7486.36 --> 7491.92
to officially reg your register yourself

7489.719 --> 7495.559
as mentally mentally handicapped in

7491.92 --> 7497.599
order to get money yeah you go on that

7495.559 --> 7500.84
list I don't want to be on that list I

7497.599 --> 7502.32
want the minimum I don't officially I am

7500.84 --> 7506.119000000001
completely

7502.32 --> 7507.119
sane yeah I'm not registered with any

7506.119 --> 7509.598999999999
mental

7507.119 --> 7513.32
incapacities I don't receive benefits

7509.599 --> 7515.559
for mental incapacities I live minimum

7513.32 --> 7518.92
social welfare that is

7515.559 --> 7520.88
fair that is fair because I'm not

7518.92 --> 7523.96
completely

7520.88 --> 7526.04
incapable I'm just kind of tough dealing

7523.96 --> 7528.4
with other

7526.04 --> 7530.84
people and other people have a tough

7528.4 --> 7533.598999999999
time dealing with me and my extreme mood

7530.84 --> 7536.76
swings which are there they're just

7533.599 --> 7538.679
there it's just how it is I can't do

7536.76 --> 7541.04
anything about it I wish I didn't have

7538.679 --> 7544.52
it I do it always

7541.04 --> 7546.679
happens and people have to deal with it

7544.52 --> 7547.679
and a lot of them don't want to so they

7546.679 --> 7549.1990000000005
fire

7547.679 --> 7551.599
me

7549.199 --> 7554.558999999999
and that's my history and I don't care

7551.599 --> 7559.8
to repeat that history so if you want me

7554.559 --> 7562.4400000000005
to have a job give it to me then and I

7559.8 --> 7565.88
will do it I do my job

7562.44 --> 7569.04
well but I'm not a robot I have mood

7565.88 --> 7570.8
swings I have opinions I have

7569.04 --> 7574.28
constructive

7570.8 --> 7577.599
criticism and I'm protective of whatever

7574.28 --> 7580.599
I am a part

7577.599 --> 7580.599
of

7584.36 --> 7587.639
so that's how it

7588.84 --> 7598.159000000001
works the system is one size fits all

7592.599 --> 7598.159000000001
yeah so one size fits nobody that's the

7599.28 --> 7603.84
system everybody has to like mutate

7602.28 --> 7606.88
themselves in order to fit in that

7603.84 --> 7609.119000000001
system which is

7606.88 --> 7613.639
torturous yeah so the system

7609.119 --> 7613.639
is one size fits no

7623.079 --> 7628.599
one I might be good as a delivery job

7625.8 --> 7630.96
yeah I know I'd be great except those

7628.599 --> 7635.559
jobs are all

7630.96 --> 7638.079
taken all of them like they don't

7635.559 --> 7639.88
even oh and there all brown people by

7638.079 --> 7643.96
the way I haven't seen like a white

7639.88 --> 7643.96
delivery guy in

7644.4 --> 7649.92
years they don't give those jobs to

7646.88 --> 7649.92
people like me

7654.04 --> 7659.32
never I'd love it I'd love to do that

7657.0 --> 7662.4
I'd love to drive around do it right do

7659.32 --> 7664.199
it quick deliver people to the doorstep

7662.4 --> 7666.719
hand it over even after they walk all

7664.199 --> 7670.48
the way up a staircase and smile while

7666.719 --> 7673.679
doing it and be

7670.48 --> 7675.759999999999
dynamic I'll do

7673.679 --> 7678.079

anti-national crap

7691.88 --> 7696.84

7694.44 --> 7699.36
systematically just trying to destroy

7696.84 --> 7702.76

not if you can't they prefer to give you

7723.32 --> 7728.679
that job now that's how they work now

7726.76 --> 7730.079000000001

7730.079 --> 7736.36
extra money too like anything but a

7733.199 --> 7737.48
local here cuz they must die they must

7736.36 --> 7740.119
kill

7737.48 --> 7744.36
themselves we don't give them jobs we

7740.119 --> 7746.88
only shame them and bully people like

7744.36 --> 7749.5199999999995
them and teach others how to bully

7746.88 --> 7749.52
people like

7756.559 --> 7760.4800000000005
them make me deliver you driver so Les M

7759.559 --> 7763.96
gets

7760.48 --> 7766.558999999999
stolen maybe I don't it's not that bad

7763.96 --> 7769.32
of I mean this is not United States okay

7766.559 --> 7772.719
Nathan R in the United States it's way

7769.32 --> 7776.558999999999
worse like that's it's so out of control

7772.719 --> 7779.079
but it's just it's getting there slowly

7776.559 --> 7781.079000000001
it's slowly going in that direction and

7779.079 --> 7783.199
nobody in the Netherlands actually wants

7781.079 --> 7785.199
that they're all pissed off at it at it

7783.199 --> 7787.32
it's just that this [ __ ] black rock

7785.199 --> 7790.32
man it's

7787.32 --> 7790.32
everywhere

7792.4 --> 7796.079
they're buying

7793.84 --> 7798.52
everything everything's going bust it's

7796.079 --> 7800.159
all becoming Black Rock all of

7798.52 --> 7803.679
it I

7800.159 --> 7806.719
mean I don't even know the exact

7803.679 --> 7810.84
percentages or anything but on a wild

7806.719 --> 7812.599
guesstimate I'd say like maybe 50% of

7810.84 --> 7814.2390000000005
corporations in the Netherlands are in

7812.599 --> 7816.04
Black

7814.239 --> 7819.959999999999
Rock

7816.04 --> 7823.0
15 yeah that's how much there's left and

7819.96 --> 7825.36
that's going to go too except for those

7823.0 --> 7829.239
businesses that literally are like

7825.36 --> 7833.04
internal and like they can't go bust

7829.239 --> 7833.04
because it's not really about

7834.8 --> 7840.04
money it's just like labor

7844.88 --> 7853.679
anyway driver near here Liv so guns

7850.76 --> 7856.679
delivering

7853.679 --> 7856.679
what

7859.639 --> 7865.84
okay what's wrong with selling guns

7862.559 --> 7865.84
though unless it was

7872.199 --> 7876.759999999999
illegally majority of houses being

7874.44 --> 7880.159
bought in my town is now by Indians yeah

7876.76 --> 7880.159000000001

7902.52 --> 7910.719
that's the plan that's the Black Rock

7906.679 --> 7912.639
plan yeah first bribe everybody with

7910.719 --> 7915.0
huge

7912.639 --> 7917.679
incomes give them everything they need

7915.0 --> 7920.04
all they have to be is completely

7917.679 --> 7923.2390000000005
Psychopathic and be

7920.04 --> 7925.119
like okay with long-term plans of

7923.239 --> 7926.839999999999
Exterminating people that absolutely

7925.119 --> 7930.4
don't deserve

7926.84 --> 7933.119000000001
it yeah and then you'll get everything

7930.4 --> 7935.239
yeah all you have to do is a [ __ ]

7933.119 --> 7937.28
disgusting monster and you'll get

7935.239 --> 7938.839999999999
everything they'll give everything to

7937.28 --> 7942.04
you

7938.84 --> 7944.96
if if you're part of their plan you get

7942.04 --> 7947.5199999999995
everything and then you can fawn over

7944.96 --> 7948.96
like a Dying Breed that's being

7947.52 --> 7951.599
suffocated

7948.96 --> 7954.32
slowly and like kick them when they're

7951.599 --> 7957.079
down that's what you're there for that's

7954.32 --> 7958.96
where they come they're there to kick

7957.079 --> 7962.799999999999
you when you're

7958.96 --> 7962.8
down that's why they're brought

7966.76 --> 7973.76
there was so supposed to deliver guns

and sold them for some what the

7973.76 --> 7978.280000000001
[ __ ] okay yeah that's not good Nathan R

7981.8 --> 7988.559
that's but to be fair though I mean you

7984.559 --> 7988.559
can just solve that problem

7991.52 --> 7998.679
right can solve that problem in in one

7995.96 --> 8001.4800000000005
goal like oh he's he's toldo guns from

7998.679 --> 8004.52
you right okay well then

8001.48 --> 8008.4
just become a buyer of his stolen guns

8004.52 --> 8008.400000000001
and then like oh yeah that one oh yeah

8008.639 --> 8011.639
thanks

8015.96 --> 8022.8
bye yeah no more stealing

8019.8 --> 8025.400000000001
guns yeah you can't steal somebody's

8022.8 --> 8028.119000000001
guns with your job when you don't have a

8025.4 --> 8031.36
head anymore because it's splattered in

8028.119 --> 8031.36
in all over the place

8048.079 --> 8053.0
so right and the judge do I mean those

8051.32 --> 8055.639
judges those

8053.0 --> 8057.559
people whatever gets in there those

8055.639 --> 8059.679
judges they should all be tortured to

8057.559 --> 8065.719
death like people that do that in the

8059.679 --> 8065.719
judges like literally literally roast

8070.159 --> 8077.36
them because they are those judges are

8074.36 --> 8080.159
what literally the Cornerstone of what's

8077.36 --> 8081.4
making everybody so [ __ ] criminal

8080.159 --> 8086.159
it's those

8081.4 --> 8089.28
judges they should be horrendously

8086.159 --> 8092.36
executed yeah

8089.28 --> 8096.5199999999995
like nobody [ __ ] cares about their

8092.36 --> 8099.04
internal miswiring with their ridiculous

8096.52 --> 8101.2390000000005
Marxism they're literally what keeps

8099.04 --> 8105.559
criminality getting worse and they

8101.239 --> 8109.558999999999
should be horrendously executed on a

8105.559 --> 8109.559
fire screaming

8116.8 --> 8121.8
death

8119.119 --> 8121.799999999999
ah let's get

8123.28 --> 8129.0
yellow right so yeah let's just where I

8126.679 --> 8129.0
see

8141.38 --> 8149.8
[Music]

8146.8 --> 8149.8
things

8169.559 --> 8176.4400000000005
right but I mean it Nathan are like if

8173.199 --> 8179.4
judges do that kind of judgment they

8176.44 --> 8182.4
should have an instant Mark of Death on

8179.4 --> 8182.4
their head

8186.52 --> 8191.8
like they are the Cornerstone of the

8192.12 --> 8200.599
problem yeah I mean if you have good

8195.12 --> 8202.439
judges that are strict and like fair and

8200.599 --> 8205.84
equal in the

8202.439 --> 8208.24
Judgment then no matter how terrible the

8205.84 --> 8210.719000000001
overall situation is in a country

8208.24 --> 8212.599
it will be relatively doable it might be

8210.719 --> 8214.678999999998
heavy on the police cuz they're

8212.599 --> 8217.319
overwhelmed or whatever but it will be

8214.679 --> 8219.16
doable but with judges like that it

8217.319 --> 8222.039999999999
doesn't matter what the hell you do

8219.16 --> 8224.399
everything is going to go to [ __ ] cuz

8222.04 --> 8227.160000000002
the police can't do

8224.399 --> 8229.84
anything what's the point of doing

8227.16 --> 8234.639
anything when people can just get away

8229.84 --> 8234.639000000001
with horrendous crimes without any

8234.76 --> 8243.76
consequence there's no point

8239.479 --> 8248.359999999999
so judges that do that should be just

8243.76 --> 8248.36
[Music]

8253.399 --> 8259.399
assassinated at least not be allowed

8255.319 --> 8259.399
near no no no they should

8260.08 --> 8264.719
die you do that you should be

8266.599 --> 8273.719000000001
executed near record no no you did that

8271.439 --> 8276.519
you became part of it and you abused it

8273.719 --> 8276.518999999998
you should

8277.1 --> 8283.12
[Music]

8279.519 --> 8285.479
die yeah there should be a risk you want

8283.12 --> 8288.639000000001
to be a judge you do it right you're

8285.479 --> 8292.679
corrupted then you

8288.639 --> 8295.119999999999
die yeah that's my

8292.679 --> 8297.639
judgment there's nothing worse than a

8295.12 --> 8301.479000000001
corrupted judge nothing they deserve the

8297.639 --> 8301.479
death panalty for just for being

8305.549 --> 8310.679
[Music]

8308.319 --> 8313.039999999999
corrupt have I ever been in a cart room

8310.679 --> 8317.0
situation

8313.04 --> 8317.0
yeah that's a while back

8326.519 --> 8329.519
though

8333.24 --> 8340.559
yeah but I mean yeah what what how do

8337.399 --> 8343.0
you judge it right well if somebody's

8340.559 --> 8344.119999999999
just like in a terrible time and they do

8343.0 --> 8346.319
something

8344.12 --> 8349.160000000002
wrong because they're like going through

8346.319 --> 8351.599
a terrible time which is like

8349.16 --> 8354.479
traceable then yeah a judge should be a

8351.599 --> 8356.880000000001
little bit lenient if somebody's just

8354.479 --> 8360.08
systematically performing crime and

8356.88 --> 8362.719
stealing and selling

8360.08 --> 8367.039999999999
illegally dangerous goods I mean there

8362.719 --> 8369.438999999998
is no possible

8367.04 --> 8373.559000000001
justification to give that person six

8369.439 --> 8373.559000000001
days there is no possible

8374.639 --> 8379.16
justification there's no logical train

8376.92 --> 8381.8
of thinking that would lead you to

8379.16 --> 8385.319
believe that that judge was acting other

8381.8 --> 8386.438999999998
than in full disdain of the nation and

8385.319 --> 8389.439
full

8386.439 --> 8389.439
corruption

8407.6 --> 8412.08
yeah there another corrupted perching

8409.24 --> 8413.08
was yeah they keep shooting until it's

8412.08 --> 8415.16
all

8413.08 --> 8418.84
gone

8415.16 --> 8420.96
yeah if there is an apparat of people

8418.84 --> 8425.439
keeping the corrupted in place then that

8420.96 --> 8425.438999999998
entire apparatus should be

8425.92 --> 8429.09
[Music]

8445.64 --> 8449.319
exterminated yeah

8461.84 --> 8464.52

somebody that steals Weaponry in their

8603.92 --> 8609.12
job that they're supposed to deliver and

8605.64 --> 8612.88
then sell it illegally there is no deal

8609.12 --> 8615.68
that should ever amount to that guy only

8612.88 --> 8619.358999999999
getting six days in jail there's just no

8615.68 --> 8621.08

m t talk yeah that's not really a good

8781.88 --> 8784.278999999999
title

8805.8 --> 8808.8
though

8820.0 --> 8825.56
yeah no I'm not going to title that Ste

8827.88 --> 8838.199999999999
trer give Arwin a job or shots

8832.319 --> 8840.56
that's not a good way to no

8838.2 --> 8843.279
no I it's funny though I mean I will

8840.56 --> 8847.399
tell trolls that I'm not going to put it

8843.279 --> 8847.399000000001
in the title this just

8850.68 --> 8856.479000000001
weird but see what I mean is like all

8853.24 --> 8856.479
these different little

8857.2 --> 8862.479000000001
subjects it's just not really a cohesive

8863.12 --> 8869.84
title CU I've been talking about all

8865.88 --> 8869.839999999998
this different stuff stuff all over the

8895.279 --> 8898.640000000001
place okay

8904.479 --> 8908.599999999999
to see what you want to

8909.279 --> 8914.279
do does it all fit in a singular

8917.04 --> 8925.439
room variety

8920.16 --> 8925.439
hour okay but it's more than an hour

8925.6 --> 8928.6
though

8935.52 --> 8938.84
maybe I'll just keep it open and blank

8937.64 --> 8943.08
for a

8938.84 --> 8945.6
change like the title not being there is

8943.08 --> 8946.52
like kind of a shock in itself by now

8945.6 --> 8949.800000000001
because

8946.52 --> 8952.880000000001
I it's been like a month since I last

8949.8 --> 8952.88
didn't title a

8955.399 --> 8962.358999999999
show why do I want to do I like doing

8958.72 --> 8962.358999999999
this I like doing this

8970.56 --> 8976.72
show yeah but it's also about how much

8973.359 --> 8979.6
room does it require

8976.72 --> 8981.119999999999
because like if I need a separate room

8979.6 --> 8984.6
for

8981.12 --> 8987.92
it because it's like piles of paper

8984.6 --> 8991.399000000001
everywhere yeah that doesn't fit here at

8987.92 --> 8993.64
all right I mean I'd love to like go

8991.399 --> 8996.84
back to Gold smithing I still have the

8993.64 --> 9000.24
equipment I just don't have the

8996.84 --> 9002.72
room that's the issue with it that's the

9000.24 --> 9002.72
primary

9009.08 --> 9013.88
issue but I don't need any tips

9015.439 --> 9018.439
thanks

9037.88 --> 9041.72
especially at the end of the show

9042.04 --> 9050.319000000001
so some to look at maybe if it's do

9047.319 --> 9050.319
doable

9051.64 --> 9057.039999999999
maybe but the problem is is that those

9054.24 --> 9058.119999999999
types of jobs that's all they take up a

9057.04 --> 9061.04
lot of

9058.12 --> 9063.240000000002
time they don't get you an actual income

9061.04 --> 9065.6
and then you have to do like five or six

9063.24 --> 9067.64
of those types of jobs just to like be

9065.6 --> 9071.04
able to get around and then you don't

9067.64 --> 9071.039999999999
have time for anything else

9074.12 --> 9079.84
anymore yeah there's in inite amount of

9077.439 --> 9083.479000000001
shitty jobs that don't pay

9079.84 --> 9086.84
anything they're all over the

9083.479 --> 9089.278999999999
place you can absolutely waste all your

9086.84 --> 9092.279
time just trying to get

9089.279 --> 9092.279
by

9105.359 --> 9108.359
absolutely

9114.2 --> 9120.52
right but I really meant not like weird

9119.479 --> 9125.199999999999
home

9120.52 --> 9127.68
jobs like task oriented home jobs I'm

9125.2 --> 9130.279
thought thinking about well more like an

9127.68 --> 9130.279
actual

9135.279 --> 9138.279
job

9147.68 --> 9154.720000000001
be cool if a jeweler was yeah sure

9150.72 --> 9157.8
except there's like a 100,000 other

9154.72 --> 9160.72
goldsmiths that have like 20 years more

9157.8 --> 9163.319
non-stop experience and in the field

9160.72 --> 9165.24
that are really eager to get that job as

9163.319 --> 9168.24
well steamy

9165.24 --> 9168.24
Traveler

9172.46 --> 9175.63
[Music]

9183.64 --> 9190.8
that job market yeah well Richard G

9186.92 --> 9193.319
that's that is [ __ ] and I I stopped

9190.8 --> 9195.16
trying specifically because of that kind

9193.319 --> 9198.08
of

9195.16 --> 9201.84
[ __ ]

9198.08 --> 9201.84
like I'm not dealing with it

9208.479 --> 9214.679999999998
anymore what do you think it's about

9210.6 --> 9214.68
fashion it's stupid

9215.8 --> 9222.479
