83.84 --> 89.28
so

85.52 --> 90.39999999999999
the weather today kind of odd

89.28 --> 93.759
it's

90.4 --> 93.759
like really hazy

93.92 --> 98.52
and warm like that

100.88 --> 105.6
this weird

103.439 --> 108.72
there's a little bit of blue here

105.6 --> 110.55999999999999
i can see now but it's kind of been even

108.72 --> 111.84
more grey than this

110.56 --> 113.52
yet

111.84 --> 115.60000000000001
the sun's still coming through and it's

113.52 --> 117.36
just being this weird

115.6 --> 119.759
moist

117.36 --> 119.759
warmth

121.84 --> 126.71900000000001
odd very odd weather

125.2 --> 129.2
very still

126.719 --> 132.879
sound

129.2 --> 132.879
doesn't seem to carry that far

134.239 --> 136.959
it's like this

137.84 --> 144.239
sharp tones get absorbed easily

142.0 --> 144.239
all right

144.879 --> 149.84
hello cleary first in chat good to see

147.68 --> 149.84
you

151.36 --> 157.84
55 fahrenheit i don't know how much that

154.319 --> 159.28
is and i yeah

157.84 --> 163.20000000000002
it is the

159.28 --> 166.92
it is saturday the 25th of

163.2 --> 166.92
september 2021

173.28 --> 175.599
what

177.28 --> 179.84
okay

182.159 --> 185.159
hmm

196.72 --> 202.48
oh okay

199.44 --> 206.319
a sound tip that's great

202.48 --> 206.319
yeah i don't use audio bananas

207.12 --> 212.0
it

207.92 --> 216.07999999999998
didn't work out so far

212.0 --> 218.64
hey slo-mo moon buggy good to see you

216.08 --> 219.68
i think my volume should be just fine

218.64 --> 222.07999999999998
now

219.68 --> 222.08
isn't it

223.12 --> 228.31900000000002
no

225.2 --> 230.07999999999998
blatant sound distortions distortions or

228.319 --> 233.72
anything

230.08 --> 233.72
right anyway

240.72 --> 246.959
went to bed not so early last night

243.92 --> 249.76
but still had a pretty good night rest

246.959 --> 254.239
i do indulge a little when i know

249.76 --> 256.479
i'm having an hour later show

254.239 --> 257.84000000000003
but also yeah after midnight bumped into

256.479 --> 259.68
this

257.84 --> 261.919
channel funnily through

259.68 --> 263.04
recommendation

261.919 --> 265.12
of like

263.04 --> 266.639
what what's left over after a stream

265.12 --> 268.4
stops you know the box with the

266.639 --> 270.32
suggestions

268.4 --> 274.08
well there were there was one in there

270.32 --> 274.96
that kind of was like hey what's this

274.08 --> 278.15999999999997
some

274.96 --> 278.15999999999997
sci-fi channel

278.479 --> 285.44
and it was actually a movie

281.36 --> 285.44
and miniseries maker

285.52 --> 289.919
that's been out there for years and i

288.16 --> 292.24
don't know

289.919 --> 294.32
how this is possible but there's like

292.24 --> 298.479
extremely

294.32 --> 298.479
well made sci-fi

298.8 --> 301.759
well videos on there

300.479 --> 303.919
like a

301.759 --> 306.47900000000004
movie style

303.919 --> 310.71999999999997
and i watched one

306.479 --> 314.08
that just impressed me so much

310.72 --> 314.08000000000004
i have to make mention of it

314.72 --> 319.91900000000004
it was all in all like 70 minutes

318.32 --> 324.56
a seven part

319.919 --> 328.32
series of roughly 10 minutes each

324.56 --> 328.32
and it was just astonishing

334.72 --> 338.47900000000004
hold on

336.56 --> 341.6
right atropa

338.479 --> 341.59999999999997
on the dust channel

342.16 --> 346.40000000000003
and well according to this post it's

344.56 --> 349.44
been out there

346.4 --> 349.44
not even two weeks

350.24 --> 354.96000000000004
so this is fresh fresh off the shelves

353.039 --> 357.759
and i thought that the overall quality

354.96 --> 357.75899999999996
of this mini

358.72 --> 361.28000000000003
this thing

360.0 --> 364.4
this mini

361.28 --> 368.55999999999995
mini series seven shorts of 10 minutes

364.4 --> 371.28
one story one situation

368.56 --> 373.199
was really on par with movies like

371.28 --> 375.59999999999997
interstellar

373.199 --> 377.36
for real guys like the people that made

375.6 --> 380.56
this

377.36 --> 382.56
really know their sci-fi

380.56 --> 383.759
it's it's a whole different level it's

382.56 --> 386.08
good

383.759 --> 388.56
so if you're a fan of sci-fi if you're

386.08 --> 392.08
interested in

388.56 --> 394.96
space-time conceptual mechanics

392.08 --> 397.12
this is very interesting

394.96 --> 400.31899999999996
little series to check out so i'm gonna

397.12 --> 402.88
link you up to the first episode

400.319 --> 402.88
in chat

403.44 --> 407.56
i couldn't stop watching it

411.44 --> 416.96
so bored over

413.199 --> 416.96000000000004
bored with the trolls over at brennan's

418.24 --> 422.919
yeah i understand that cleary

428.08 --> 434.35999999999996
can't get more scientific than a time

430.08 --> 434.35999999999996
traveling ghost what

439.199 --> 441.52000000000004
all right

445.919 --> 449.19899999999996
but overall

447.599 --> 451.759
it's still fresh in memory in this

449.199 --> 453.599
series

451.759 --> 457.199
it was

453.599 --> 458.319
brilliant piece of storytelling

457.199 --> 461.599
and

458.319 --> 463.36
like the person that made it like new

461.599 --> 465.12
movies like he

463.36 --> 466.40000000000003
it just really stood out to me and there

465.12 --> 468.479
were only

466.4 --> 470.4
only just

468.479 --> 471.919
like one or two things in the whole

470.4 --> 474.79999999999995
thing

471.919 --> 474.79999999999995
that kind of were like

476.8 --> 481.84000000000003
i might have actually just vetoed that

480.0 --> 482.879
if i was on the decision-making board

481.84 --> 484.15999999999997
for that

482.879 --> 487.36
but

484.16 --> 489.84000000000003
just two freaking little things

487.36 --> 494.24
and the rest was like holy [ __ ] man

489.84 --> 497.44
that's it's like almost consistent of

494.24 --> 500.0
good parts of movies

497.44 --> 502.24
good the good parts of sci-fi movies the

500.0 --> 506.8
things you like of sci-fi movies

502.24 --> 510.40000000000003
they put it all together very quickly

506.8 --> 510.40000000000003
and the acting was good

511.28 --> 518.0799999999999
like convincing characters were

514.719 --> 518.08
simple but interesting

518.399 --> 524.8
it was great and the cgi was like whoa

522.56 --> 524.8
dude

528.959 --> 533.3599999999999
like impressive

530.56 --> 536.0799999999999
it wasn't like oh the

533.36 --> 538.9590000000001
most unbelievable mind twisting

536.08 --> 542.08
perfection graphics perhaps

538.959 --> 545.1199999999999
but it was really good graphics

542.08 --> 547.44
good enough absolutely good enough and

545.12 --> 551.36
i'm certain that they've used

547.44 --> 551.36
cgi even like in the

551.519 --> 557.2
on the scene as it were

553.839 --> 559.6
like uh complementary cgi

557.2 --> 561.2
but they did it so subtly that it

559.6 --> 564.399
actually did

561.2 --> 566.9590000000001
it was hard to tell at times

564.399 --> 568.24
and that that is just good movie making

566.959 --> 570.16
so

568.24 --> 572.5600000000001
gushing

570.16 --> 576.4399999999999
check it out it's good

572.56 --> 576.4399999999999
it's really good

576.56 --> 579.5999999999999
and

577.36 --> 582.5600000000001
even ballers are definitely gonna

579.6 --> 582.5600000000001
appreciate this one

584.48 --> 588.839
oh interstellar he was the gravity oh

586.56 --> 591.92
right right right right sort of yeah

588.839 --> 594.1600000000001
yeah oh interesting yeah with that it

591.92 --> 596.8
was even a little bit more creative it

594.16 --> 598.4399999999999
was like interdep what made interstellar

596.8 --> 600.3199999999999
so interesting was like the

598.44 --> 601.7600000000001
inter-dimensional

600.32 --> 603.44
interaction

601.76 --> 604.399
right

603.44 --> 607.839
and

604.399 --> 609.839
well they did that sort of well not like

607.839 --> 612.1600000000001
that it's it's a very different little

609.839 --> 616.0790000000001
series

612.16 --> 618.7199999999999
but there is like space-time distortion

616.079 --> 621.279
very in the star trek setup

618.72 --> 621.279
but just

625.279 --> 630.16
man i'd have to look through it again

628.079 --> 631.92
because things happen sometimes where

630.16 --> 634.64
it's just like whoa is there some kind

631.92 --> 638.64
of a fractal time split up

634.64 --> 638.64
it's very confusing it is

639.92 --> 645.04
the same system as what they tried to

643.12 --> 647.68
apply in a movie probably never heard of

645.04 --> 650.3199999999999
because it is kind of shitty in ways

647.68 --> 652.88
the ghost ship it falls more under like

650.32 --> 655.36
horror sci-fi

652.88 --> 657.4399999999999
on on world

655.36 --> 659.76
nothing is a space or anything

657.44 --> 662.0790000000001
but there is like a time loop happening

659.76 --> 664.64
in there and it's like oh oh look it's

662.079 --> 667.12
all self-fulfilling but it's totally

664.64 --> 670.8
messy and stupid really

667.12 --> 673.279
well this mini movie split up in seven

670.8 --> 675.8389999999999
episodes does that

673.279 --> 677.36
as well

675.839 --> 679.839
but

677.36 --> 682.0790000000001
much more subtle

679.839 --> 684.24
and in a way that it that it really

682.079 --> 686.8389999999999
leaves me wondering like

684.24 --> 688.48
what did i actually watch

686.839 --> 691.36
because

688.48 --> 694.9590000000001
you're really forced to like reconsider

691.36 --> 697.279
what's happening a couple of times

694.959 --> 699.3599999999999
it's like what

697.279 --> 700.48
anyway interesting

699.36 --> 702.64
really

700.48 --> 705.76
good sci-fi

702.64 --> 705.76
i i was shocked

708.88 --> 711.68
and

709.92 --> 713.36
i almost can't

711.68 --> 716.2399999999999
believe that like

713.36 --> 718.0790000000001
they made this series apparently or dust

716.24 --> 720.24
is the representative

718.079 --> 722.56
but like they must have like a serious

720.24 --> 725.6
movie studio or whatever going on and

722.56 --> 727.76
great cgi guys and music guys like

725.6 --> 730.32
classical

727.76 --> 733.2
and electro music

730.32 --> 733.2
it's like whoa

733.76 --> 739.12
but this channel is completely filled

736.639 --> 740.9590000000001
with like hundreds of short movies

739.12 --> 744.639
hundreds i can't believe and they're

740.959 --> 748.0
probably not as good as this one

744.639 --> 750.8
but still just the amount of effort

748.0 --> 752.88
i i can't believe it that there's so

750.8 --> 757.7199999999999
much on this channel

752.88 --> 757.72
like how where does he find the time

758.399 --> 764.72
or is he actually just managing a

761.04 --> 764.7199999999999
company but then why would

764.8 --> 767.8389999999999
how would that work

768.0 --> 773.839
when it's just there free to see on

771.12 --> 777.2
youtube i don't understand

773.839 --> 777.2
and i'm even surprised that

778.399 --> 782.8
oh it is a pretty big channel

780.6 --> 784.32
2.57 million

782.8 --> 788.399
subscribers

784.32 --> 788.399
but yeah anyway

792.079 --> 794.959
hey good servant

796.16 --> 801.8389999999999
thank you

798.0 --> 801.839
i hope the best for you too

802.079 --> 806.959
hello james mason

804.32 --> 806.9590000000001
son mao

811.12 --> 816.8
was that reflected of an old term what i

813.839 --> 816.8000000000001
don't know what you mean

816.959 --> 822.0
but i read your comment a little late uh

819.839 --> 825.0400000000001
i am so bored with it oh right right

822.0 --> 825.04
ryan q vincent

825.44 --> 830.0790000000001
alexandro

826.839 --> 832.8800000000001
gonzalez and tomonoid of course

830.079 --> 832.88
from the grave

833.519 --> 842.519
spherical triangles exist oh really

838.24 --> 842.519
how is that a triangle then

844.48 --> 850.0790000000001
yeah

845.36 --> 852.24
anyway yeah that the title was from

850.079 --> 855.04
i think from brandon's or was it from

852.24 --> 857.6800000000001
the yeah it was from brandon's i got in

855.04 --> 858.88
there too by the way but i didn't really

857.68 --> 861.3599999999999
talk much

858.88 --> 862.959
so everybody was kind of ignoring me

861.36 --> 865.6
i don't even know how much came through

862.959 --> 868.16
my my freaking mic just constantly zoned

865.6 --> 870.88
out thanks to discord

868.16 --> 873.36
sometimes every minute

870.88 --> 875.6
eventually did stop though but i didn't

873.36 --> 880.0790000000001
really participate anymore guess that's

875.6 --> 882.399
what he wanted right discord ghost

880.079 --> 885.399
i hate that thing

882.399 --> 885.399
uh

886.24 --> 890.8
does it have a ton of commercials no

895.519 --> 901.04
now there's no product placement

897.76 --> 901.04
in it whatsoever

904.8 --> 910.079
also has a cameo of a pretty epic

907.68 --> 910.079
actor

910.72 --> 918.24
in it cameo really awesome

914.16 --> 918.24
and he was he fit right in

918.32 --> 921.9200000000001
like serious

919.68 --> 921.92
uh

923.04 --> 927.76
just check it out

924.72 --> 931.32
it's like in total it's 70 minutes long

927.76 --> 931.3199999999999
something like that

948.079 --> 951.279
all right yeah from the grave you'll

949.44 --> 954.24
have to explain what a spherical

951.279 --> 958.8
triangle is in

954.24 --> 958.8
because as far as i know that's nonsense

962.72 --> 968.0400000000001
anyway

963.759 --> 968.04
hello mn drogo

968.89 --> 972.3199999999999
[Music]

978.13 --> 981.809
[Music]

990.079 --> 997.199
right also before the show

993.68 --> 999.519
sphere also have edges no they have an

997.199 --> 1000.88
edge not edges

999.519 --> 1004.24
that's incorrect

1000.88 --> 1007.12
spheres have an edge not edges

1004.24 --> 1007.12
just one edge

1007.36 --> 1012.5600000000001
so when you look at it it's the edge

1009.68 --> 1014.3199999999999
where it blocks things from you as a

1012.56 --> 1016.88
viewer

1014.32 --> 1019.759
from what is behind it that's the edge

1016.88 --> 1019.759
of a sphere

1020.24 --> 1024.48
now if you say

1021.92 --> 1027.4389999999999
spheres

1024.48 --> 1029.199
yeah spheres have edges

1027.439 --> 1031.52
it's tricky because if you're talking

1029.199 --> 1031.52
about

1031.919 --> 1037.919
the sphere as in spheres

1034.559 --> 1040.48
as in the sphere universal the sphere

1037.919 --> 1042.88
have edges well

1040.48 --> 1045.28
one sphere has an edge but technically

1042.88 --> 1046.7990000000002
if you have ten spheres then they all

1045.28 --> 1049.12
have an edge

1046.799 --> 1052.72
in that sense it had you they all have

1049.12 --> 1055.1999999999998
edges all the spheres have edges see

1052.72 --> 1055.2
but that's

1056.48 --> 1062.88
it makes it confusing

1059.6 --> 1062.8799999999999
is it a fixed edge

1063.12 --> 1065.4399999999998
yes

1065.84 --> 1069.12
it's a geometric edge

1070.08 --> 1077.799
if the sphere is fixed in size then the

1073.919 --> 1077.7990000000002
edge is also fixed

1080.559 --> 1084.72
you looked for one on your football well

1084.88 --> 1089.8400000000001
you shouldn't be looking on the football

1087.52 --> 1092.4
you should be looking at the football

1089.84 --> 1095.1999999999998
and then when you look at it

1092.4 --> 1096.0800000000002
then you'll notice that

1095.2 --> 1098.72
where

1096.08 --> 1101.84
it blocks something that might be behind

1098.72 --> 1104.96
it or not but it flux blocks the view

1101.84 --> 1108.559
from behind the football

1104.96 --> 1110.48
and yeah the border where it blocks

1108.559 --> 1113.52
things optically

1110.48 --> 1115.28
from you behind it that's the edge of

1113.52 --> 1118.559
the football

1115.28 --> 1118.559
how close do you need to be

1121.679 --> 1123.8400000000001
well

1125.039 --> 1129.28
oh yeah it doesn't really matter like

1127.6 --> 1131.1999999999998
look if you press it straight at your

1129.28 --> 1133.6789999999999
eye and you don't see

1131.2 --> 1135.28
you see nothing but like once part of

1133.679 --> 1138.3200000000002
the surface of your football yeah then

1135.28 --> 1141.9189999999999
you're not gonna see the edge

1138.32 --> 1144.1599999999999
but as long as it's far away enough

1141.919 --> 1146.0
that you can see the entire football in

1144.16 --> 1150.3200000000002
your view then

1146.0 --> 1152.32
it has an edge to you as the observer

1150.32 --> 1155.52
for our winning units no no that only

1152.32 --> 1158.08
works the geometric edges are not

1155.52 --> 1159.6
i can't measure

1158.08 --> 1162.799
geometry

1159.6 --> 1166.559
in arwenian units snowbirds that only

1162.799 --> 1166.559
works for holographics

1171.52 --> 1176.08
that's right it's done monkey 3d it's

1173.52 --> 1176.08
silhouette

1176.48 --> 1181.24
edge right it is an edge

1195.919 --> 1202.88
that's better than spheric

1199.76 --> 1206.799
better than you mean more preferable

1202.88 --> 1209.44
for those that don't like to be reminded

1206.799 --> 1211.84
that geometric objects

1209.44 --> 1213.76
including spheres have an edge

1211.84 --> 1217.039
when you look at them

1213.76 --> 1221.4
no i like to say sphere edge on purpose

1217.039 --> 1221.4
because it is technically correct

1222.0 --> 1226.64
i'd just like to rub that in

1224.48 --> 1230.48
specifically for the reason to remind

1226.64 --> 1233.3600000000001
you that spheres have an edge

1230.48 --> 1235.6
it's a geometric edge it's where

1233.36 --> 1238.32
it starts to block things from the

1235.6 --> 1238.32
observer

1238.799 --> 1244.799
from what is behind the sphere you see

1241.919 --> 1248.159
i'd like to remind ballers about that

1244.799 --> 1249.9189999999999
especially when they bring it up

1248.159 --> 1251.919
and they complain about it because they

1249.919 --> 1255.3600000000001
just didn't get they didn't get it they

1251.919 --> 1258.4
didn't understand what i what it implies

1255.36 --> 1261.8799999999999
that's why i'm explaining it again

1258.4 --> 1261.88
it's what i do

1262.159 --> 1266.5590000000002
edge of blockage

1264.08 --> 1269.039
yeah edge of the sphere you're assuming

1266.559 --> 1269.9189999999999
you're on a sphere right

1269.039 --> 1272.32
well

1269.919 --> 1275.44
spheres have an edge

1272.32 --> 1278.08
you should be seeing that edge

1275.44 --> 1280.64
and it would be called the geometric

1278.08 --> 1280.6399999999999
horizon

1287.2 --> 1294.679
hello scroll sniper and double zap

1291.679 --> 1294.679
hmm

1313.76 --> 1316.8799999999999
right

1314.64 --> 1319.3600000000001
on a sphere

1316.88 --> 1323.1200000000001
the edge the geometric horizon would

1319.36 --> 1323.12
also be the optical horizon

1324.72 --> 1330.48
because you definitely see the edge

1328.159 --> 1334.0800000000002
geometrically physically blocking things

1330.48 --> 1336.159
behind it before you get to see

1334.08 --> 1338.08
the resolution limit

1336.159 --> 1340.72
compacting effect we know as the

1338.08 --> 1342.559
apparent horizon effect

1340.72 --> 1344.64
where your resolution just can't make it

1342.559 --> 1344.6399999999999
out

1344.84 --> 1349.9189999999999
anymore and then you get the horizon

1347.44 --> 1349.919
effect

1352.48 --> 1358.799
right and on the sphere

1355.36 --> 1361.28
the geometry blocking type of horizon

1358.799 --> 1363.12
would definitely appear

1361.28 --> 1365.52
before you could ever make out an

1363.12 --> 1367.4399999999998
apparent horizon

1365.52 --> 1370.559
you wouldn't see that apparent horizon

1367.44 --> 1373.6000000000001
because you'd get blocked

1370.559 --> 1374.8799999999999
in your view geometrically before you

1373.6 --> 1378.559
get to

1374.88 --> 1378.5590000000002
that point where you can no longer

1378.96 --> 1382.48
render things

1380.64 --> 1385.679
so they present themselves as the

1382.48 --> 1385.679
apparent horizon to you

1386.08 --> 1389.6399999999999
hello tony whitcomb

1392.799 --> 1396.6399999999999
jamaican goat curry cooking

1400.799 --> 1406.1589999999999
and you're not that late

1403.44 --> 1409.159
it's weekend i start an hour later

1406.159 --> 1409.159
remember

1420.64 --> 1425.2
can a curve block visibility like an

1423.279 --> 1427.12
edge can well

1425.2 --> 1429.44
a curve

1427.12 --> 1433.52
would be

1429.44 --> 1436.0
a description of a just a part of the

1433.52 --> 1438.6399999999999
geometry of the hole

1436.0 --> 1440.96
and it would optically

1438.64 --> 1443.44
indeed

1440.96 --> 1447.3600000000001
block things behind it and therefore be

1443.44 --> 1447.3600000000001
the edge the geometric edge

1448.159 --> 1452.7990000000002
or it could be a hill

1450.64 --> 1455.919
on top of earth

1452.799 --> 1457.039
that would also be a geometric blocking

1455.919 --> 1459.5200000000002
thing

1457.039 --> 1462.0
but it's not of course the geometry of

1459.52 --> 1464.4
the presupposed ball earth so it's

1462.0 --> 1464.4
different

1466.08 --> 1470.72
but yeah the ball earth is

1468.64 --> 1473.1200000000001
supposed to have

1470.72 --> 1476.0
a geometric edge because it's a sphere

1473.12 --> 1476.0
you're standing on

1477.279 --> 1481.36
and you should be seeing

1479.12 --> 1483.6789999999999
that geometric edge blocking things

1481.36 --> 1486.1589999999999
behind it way before you get to see any

1483.679 --> 1487.1200000000001
kind of horizon on a sphere earth you

1486.159 --> 1490.0800000000002
wouldn't

1487.12 --> 1491.279
be able to take your p900 or p1000 or

1490.08 --> 1493.6
whatever

1491.279 --> 1496.799
and start zooming in on the horizon and

1493.6 --> 1499.279
then seeing very far away things because

1496.799 --> 1500.96
those would simply be physically

1499.279 --> 1503.52
concealed

1500.96 --> 1503.52
behind

1503.919 --> 1508.7990000000002
a geometric horizon be either bulge of

1506.0 --> 1510.88
water or land or whatever

1508.799 --> 1512.48
and as you zoom in

1510.88 --> 1516.88
you just

1512.48 --> 1518.559
get close seemingly closer in the view

1516.88 --> 1520.24
to that blockage

1518.559 --> 1521.9189999999999
right it would start to blur up because

1520.24 --> 1523.44
it's very close for the zoom and all

1521.919 --> 1525.8400000000001
that

1523.44 --> 1528.559
you wouldn't see

1525.84 --> 1531.52
very fine detail in the distance

1528.559 --> 1534.1589999999999
you wouldn't be able to see that because

1531.52 --> 1538.279
you'd be blocked by the earth's geometry

1534.159 --> 1538.279
before you got to that level

1551.52 --> 1557.12
curves is edges

1554.88 --> 1559.3600000000001
no no we're not talking about edges

1557.12 --> 1560.9599999999998
we're talking about an edge

1559.36 --> 1563.84
an edge

1560.96 --> 1563.8400000000001
of an object

1564.24 --> 1569.96
a spherical object

1566.08 --> 1569.96
presumed to be earth

1576.32 --> 1581.279
we're not talking about

1578.72 --> 1584.159
geomet geometric shapes

1581.279 --> 1585.279
that are consistent of several flat

1584.159 --> 1588.64
edges

1585.279 --> 1590.96
with corners right like dice

1588.64 --> 1593.76
several types of dice

1590.96 --> 1593.76
i have a lot of them

1594.72 --> 1598.2
let me get some

1611.2 --> 1614.559
all right

1612.48 --> 1617.039
oh it's been a while

1614.559 --> 1619.279
all right so this is a twenty

1617.039 --> 1619.279
oh

1620.08 --> 1624.72
natural 20 no just kidding

1623.34 --> 1627.72
[Music]

1624.72 --> 1627.72
uh

1627.84 --> 1630.98
right so this is a 20-sided dice god

1630.72 --> 1632.64
damn

1630.98 --> 1633.84
[Music]

1632.64 --> 1636.64
this

1633.84 --> 1638.559
is a geometric shape

1636.64 --> 1643.44
has 20

1638.559 --> 1643.44
flat planes triangles connected

1644.799 --> 1652.6399999999999
now this geometry has 20 edges

1649.919 --> 1654.48
or rather another yeah

1652.64 --> 1657.2
the amount of surfaces should be equal

1654.48 --> 1662.24
to the amount of corners yes

1657.2 --> 1663.6000000000001
so this geometry has 20 edges

1662.24 --> 1666.159
a sphere

1663.6 --> 1668.9599999999998
doesn't have is not comprised of

1666.159 --> 1670.96
separate surfaces with edges

1668.96 --> 1673.2
but as a whole sphere

1670.96 --> 1676.88
it has a singular edge

1673.2 --> 1676.88
an edge of a different nature

1677.52 --> 1680.48
it's an edge that really becomes

1679.36 --> 1685.279
involved

1680.48 --> 1687.6
not in the nature of the geometry of it

1685.279 --> 1689.84
but instead the nature of when you look

1687.6 --> 1692.08
at it so it's an edge of a different

1689.84 --> 1694.08
nature

1692.08 --> 1696.32
right and why we even call it the

1694.08 --> 1698.1589999999999
geometric edge is because of the

1696.32 --> 1700.1589999999999
contrast because of the consequential

1698.159 --> 1702.64
contrast because

1700.159 --> 1704.96
it's almost like a bit of a mix-up even

1702.64 --> 1707.2
to call it a geometric edge

1704.96 --> 1708.88
for obvious reasons that i just

1707.2 --> 1711.279
explained it's not an edge of a

1708.88 --> 1714.0800000000002
geometric nature

1711.279 --> 1717.12
but it is the edge of that specific

1714.08 --> 1720.559
spherical geometry that has consequences

1717.12 --> 1723.36
so the geometry is involved

1720.559 --> 1725.6789999999999
it's a little confusing right to oppo to

1723.36 --> 1728.8799999999999
pose the contrast with the apparent

1725.679 --> 1731.2
horizon the natural

1728.88 --> 1733.5200000000002
effect of the sky and the ground coming

1731.2 --> 1736.48
together seemingly

1733.52 --> 1740.08
because of resolution limit and it works

1736.48 --> 1740.08
really only on a flat plane

1740.399 --> 1743.12
because then there's nothing obstructing

1742.08 --> 1745.76
it

1743.12 --> 1747.279
might maybe on a concave system it would

1745.76 --> 1749.6
work too but there would be other

1747.279 --> 1752.08
consequences you'd actually see a whole

1749.6 --> 1755.36
lot more you'd be looking down upon

1752.08 --> 1756.6399999999999
things in the very far distance

1755.36 --> 1760.0
anyway

1756.64 --> 1760.0
a continuous edge

1763.12 --> 1766.36
pretty much

1771.279 --> 1776.64
are you seeking star water

1774.559 --> 1779.279
right yeah cubes do have six faces

1776.64 --> 1779.279
that's correct

1779.52 --> 1781.84
and

1782.799 --> 1786.96
a triangle

1784.64 --> 1786.96
yeah

1787.12 --> 1791.76
not spherical

1789.52 --> 1795.1589999999999
this is not spherical this is not a

1791.76 --> 1795.1589999999999
sphere people

1799.6 --> 1806.36
this is like a 3d triangle

1803.039 --> 1806.36
four sides

1808.88 --> 1813.0390000000002
all right and all the other dyes i have

1811.12 --> 1814.08
are

1813.039 --> 1817.6
not

1814.08 --> 1818.399
perfectly circular symmetrical

1817.6 --> 1820.399
like

1818.399 --> 1823.84
eight-sided dice

1820.399 --> 1823.84
which are mirror symmetrical

1824.64 --> 1828.5590000000002
and the ten-sided dice

1830.72 --> 1833.6000000000001
in the same way

1834.159 --> 1837.919
right that's that's it for my dice

1836.72 --> 1840.0
anyway

1837.919 --> 1843.039
oh wait no there's another

1840.0 --> 1846.0
one yeah this one is also spherically

1843.039 --> 1849.8799999999999
geometrical and that's a 12-sided one

1846.0 --> 1849.88
very interesting with

1850.48 --> 1854.44
five-sided faces

1872.74 --> 1875.9
[Music]

1882.24 --> 1885.1200000000001
ah man

1886.64 --> 1891.7990000000002
it's been so long since i last played d

1888.799 --> 1891.799
d

1905.76 --> 1910.399
spherical cubes

1908.64 --> 1913.3990000000001
yeah i agree

1910.399 --> 1913.399
lasher

1925.6 --> 1929.12
the cube

1927.039 --> 1930.24
has 12 edges

1929.12 --> 1933.2399999999998
no

1930.24 --> 1933.24
wait

1934.64 --> 1937.6000000000001
oh yeah you're right

1937.679 --> 1943.2
yeah i mixed up i mix it up

1940.88 --> 1945.679
i mixed up corners

1943.2 --> 1949.159
and faces with actual edges right

1945.679 --> 1949.159
there's more edges

1956.64 --> 1963.2
what that's spherical i don't even know

1958.96 --> 1966.159
what a spherical triangle is

1963.2 --> 1966.159
who brought that up

1971.84 --> 1977.519
it's really odd when i just

1975.12 --> 1979.6789999999999
name my hangout after something

1977.519 --> 1982.159
and then i even forget like where it was

1979.679 --> 1982.159
mentioned

1984.159 --> 1988.919
add four wave phones okay

1994.96 --> 1998.32
from the grave brought that up

2001.12 --> 2005.6789999999999
was it at brandon's or was it alfred

2003.519 --> 2009.159
nathan's

2005.679 --> 2009.159
hey neil cosentino

2030.0 --> 2033.76
oh

2031.279 --> 2035.44
oh okay

2033.76 --> 2039.1589999999999
yeah but he only brought it up because

2035.44 --> 2039.159
it was in my title

2051.28 --> 2056.32
any new evidence for the flats oh

2054.8 --> 2060.599
oh dear

2056.32 --> 2060.599
somebody hasn't been paying attention

2072.879 --> 2077.359
a lot of you ballers or anti-flat

2074.879 --> 2079.44
earthers whoever's behind the uh the

2077.359 --> 2081.359
account

2079.44 --> 2083.599
you're a lot like self-proclaimed

2081.359 --> 2085.839
experts that don't actually show up to

2083.599 --> 2088.0
class and then when they do

2085.839 --> 2090.56
they disrupt they don't listen they

2088.0 --> 2092.72
don't actually learn anything

2090.56 --> 2094.159
they just say no no it's all wrong it's

2092.72 --> 2095.6789999999996
like this and this

2094.159 --> 2098.6400000000003
and then they go away again and they

2095.679 --> 2101.64
don't actually listen to

2098.64 --> 2101.64
teacher

2103.28 --> 2105.8390000000004
that's you

2108.88 --> 2112.7200000000003
yeah see yeah that's exactly my point

2111.04 --> 2114.8
soldier and that's exactly what you're

2112.72 --> 2117.04
doing

2114.8 --> 2119.04
it's nothing worth a ten of value right

2117.04 --> 2122.16
so you're literally ignoring it because

2119.04 --> 2122.16
you've downplayed it

2123.68 --> 2127.2
even though it's all relevant everything

2125.28 --> 2129.599
i've said is relevant

2127.2 --> 2132.3999999999996
to understanding the situation and the

2129.599 --> 2135.6800000000003
use of words it's all very relevant

2132.4 --> 2135.6800000000003
right semantics matter

2135.839 --> 2140.88
right it might not necessarily matter as

2138.0 --> 2144.96
much like in the heat of a moment

2140.88 --> 2149.04
but when you're like defining things

2144.96 --> 2152.64
exactness then semantics matters a lot

2149.04 --> 2155.359
so it's a very worthwhile occupation

2152.64 --> 2159.2799999999997
to basically lay it out in detail to

2155.359 --> 2161.92
clarify what we're all talking about

2159.28 --> 2163.92
if you don't find that worth

2161.92 --> 2165.52
any of value you know if you don't pay

2163.92 --> 2167.359
attention to that

2165.52 --> 2169.52
well then you are going to be that

2167.359 --> 2172.7999999999997
heckler that's just apparently

2169.52 --> 2175.04
arrogantly going to come in and say

2172.8 --> 2177.3590000000004
it's all [ __ ] you haven't provided

2175.04 --> 2180.4
anything for anything yeah because you

2177.359 --> 2180.4
didn't pay attention

2182.56 --> 2188.56
right you're ignoring

2184.88 --> 2190.32
the fine teachings of semantics

2188.56 --> 2191.92
concerning the material we're all

2190.32 --> 2193.6800000000003
debating

2191.92 --> 2196.96
if you're gonna ignore that then you're

2193.68 --> 2196.96
not gonna learn anything

2199.359 --> 2201.839
uh

2204.88 --> 2208.2400000000002
inflation theory

2208.32 --> 2211.28
that's economics

2212.16 --> 2215.16
uh

2223.92 --> 2227.44
all right yeah what soldier and of

2225.839 --> 2229.599
course you fail

2227.44 --> 2231.44
to see the value

2229.599 --> 2234.0
in realizing

2231.44 --> 2236.16
geometric consequences

2234.0 --> 2237.839
of very specific claims that are made

2236.16 --> 2241.24
about the nature of the world we're

2237.839 --> 2241.24
standing on

2243.52 --> 2250.24
right why would you want to realize the

2246.8 --> 2253.8390000000004
consequences of the claims that you

2250.24 --> 2255.52
take for granted as an axiom

2253.839 --> 2259.68
why would you

2255.52 --> 2259.68
want to look into the consequences

2259.76 --> 2264.5600000000004
of that claim that you take self-evident

2262.96 --> 2266.4
you know of course you don't want that

2264.56 --> 2268.48
because then you'd actually have to do

2266.4 --> 2270.2400000000002
something then you actually do have to

2268.48 --> 2271.119
pay attention

2270.24 --> 2273.2
and

2271.119 --> 2276.079
work it out

2273.2 --> 2278.7999999999997
the belief that is turned out to be

2276.079 --> 2278.8
incorrect

2279.28 --> 2285.28
because it was critically thought about

2282.32 --> 2288.28
and discussed and problems were

2285.28 --> 2288.28
highlighted

2295.08 --> 2298.25
[Music]

2304.24 --> 2311.64
i like the stupidity required to look

2307.28 --> 2311.6400000000003
for curvature on a sphere

2312.079 --> 2316.2400000000002
oh my god who is this ed

2321.119 --> 2326.88
that takes a special type of

2324.16 --> 2329.1189999999997
talent to be able to say something like

2326.88 --> 2329.119
that

2333.28 --> 2336.48
i want to say it again

2337.359 --> 2343.92
it takes a special type of

2341.04 --> 2343.92
stupidity

2344.32 --> 2348.4
oh no yes

2345.92 --> 2351.599
special type of stupidity is required to

2348.4 --> 2354.599
look for curvature on a sphere

2351.599 --> 2354.599
hmm

2371.52 --> 2378.4
it looks flat yeah that's right

2375.119 --> 2380.56
not an inch more what you say

2378.4 --> 2384.88
yeah it is flat

2380.56 --> 2384.88
it looks flat because it is flat

2385.28 --> 2389.599
if it was a sphere you wouldn't be able

2387.52 --> 2392.24
to

2389.599 --> 2395.52
see a horizon

2392.24 --> 2397.2
at a very low observation height

2395.52 --> 2399.52
you wouldn't be able to see things

2397.2 --> 2401.4399999999996
extremely far away like that that would

2399.52 --> 2404.16
be impossible because

2401.44 --> 2406.079
the geometric horizon the edge of the

2404.16 --> 2409.92
sphere you think you're standing on

2406.079 --> 2413.119
would be blocking all of that from view

2409.92 --> 2415.52
and zooming in won't bring it back

2413.119 --> 2418.48
right because the horizon now the

2415.52 --> 2421.839
horizon that you see with your naked eye

2418.48 --> 2426.2400000000002
is an apparent effect based on the

2421.839 --> 2428.7999999999997
resolution limit that will cause

2426.24 --> 2430.9599999999996
the things in the distance to seemingly

2428.8 --> 2433.52
to you as an observer fuse but if you

2430.96 --> 2436.079
zoom in with a camera that can

2433.52 --> 2438.079
surpass that resolution limit then

2436.079 --> 2439.92
you'll find that you'll see a whole lot

2438.079 --> 2443.04
more detail

2439.92 --> 2444.7200000000003
right that can't happen on a sphere

2443.04 --> 2446.48
because with that camera with that

2444.72 --> 2449.1189999999997
higher resolution limit if you'd be

2446.48 --> 2451.68
zooming in you'd be zooming in

2449.119 --> 2455.119
on a geometric edge blocking everything

2451.68 --> 2457.839
behind it and you just get closer to the

2455.119 --> 2459.76
edge obstructing things until it's all

2457.839 --> 2461.2
blurred up to you you would not see

2459.76 --> 2462.88
anything behind it under any

2461.2 --> 2465.4399999999996
circumstance because it's a geometric

2462.88 --> 2467.44
obstruction

2465.44 --> 2470.8
and not an apparent

2467.44 --> 2472.64
merger of visuals due to resolution

2470.8 --> 2475.28
limits

2472.64 --> 2476.319
that you can overcome when you zoom in

2475.28 --> 2478.88
with the

2476.319 --> 2482.16
with an advanced camera

2478.88 --> 2482.1600000000003
see that's the difference

2487.52 --> 2491.52
it's not true

2489.2 --> 2492.25
that's impossible

2491.52 --> 2493.68
no

2492.25 --> 2495.839
[Music]

2493.68 --> 2495.839
yeah

2496.4 --> 2502.04
yeah it is true

2498.16 --> 2502.04
you know it'd be true

2512.64 --> 2516.0
talking from authority

2517.28 --> 2523.6800000000003
i'm talking from authority i know i'm

2519.68 --> 2526.48
very impressive aren't i it's because

2523.68 --> 2528.8799999999997
i know how to describe these relatively

2526.48 --> 2532.2400000000002
complex things

2528.88 --> 2532.2400000000002
on an intuitive level

2534.56 --> 2538.7999999999997
you know it's very frustrating when you

2536.4 --> 2541.2000000000003
hear somebody explaining something to

2538.8 --> 2542.6400000000003
you that you don't want to understand

2541.2 --> 2545.1189999999997
but he's so good at it that you

2542.64 --> 2547.52
understand it kind of anyway and then it

2545.119 --> 2549.04
yeah it feels like oppressive it feels

2547.52 --> 2552.16
dominating

2549.04 --> 2552.16
is scary i know

2552.24 --> 2558.8799999999997
the truth is scary

2555.359 --> 2561.119
when you are unwilling to accept it

2558.88 --> 2562.96
so that has a very dominating effect

2561.119 --> 2567.0
when somebody communicates something to

2562.96 --> 2567.0
you that you don't want to know

2599.76 --> 2604.76
just

2601.119 --> 2604.76
seriously dude

2606.72 --> 2611.359
you know that for all your complaints

2609.2 --> 2614.0
and

2611.359 --> 2615.52
like oh you conduct yourself like this

2614.0 --> 2618.0
oh

2615.52 --> 2620.56
this is wrong you haven't actually

2618.0 --> 2623.44
inserted any technical data concerning

2620.56 --> 2624.88
the subject unlike me

2623.44 --> 2628.56
soldier ant

2624.88 --> 2628.56
so this is pretty much just

2630.8 --> 2635.8390000000004
nonsense

2632.0 --> 2635.839
you're not inserting any information

2636.0 --> 2640.359
you're not actually making a case

2649.2 --> 2652.7999999999997
yes

2650.48 --> 2654.72
i hate the big one

2652.8 --> 2657.28
yeah oh oh

2654.72 --> 2659.04
distance to objects you say

2657.28 --> 2660.3190000000004
like the moon

2659.04 --> 2663.04
oh really

2660.319 --> 2665.119
the object the moon no

2663.04 --> 2667.599
no the moon is not an object the moon is

2665.119 --> 2669.6800000000003
a celestial light a luminary in big

2667.599 --> 2672.8
biblical terms

2669.68 --> 2675.359
but a celestial light will do just fine

2672.8 --> 2677.92
and i've learned something

2675.359 --> 2679.52
thing or two about the celestial lights

2677.92 --> 2681.2000000000003
based on

2679.52 --> 2685.839
obsessive

2681.2 --> 2685.839
intuitive study in the last five years

2687.119 --> 2692.4
and i had my suspicions way before that

2690.319 --> 2696.56
but it literally had nothing to reflect

2692.4 --> 2698.56
it on so it just all was purely internal

2696.56 --> 2701.119
that all of the celestial lights are

2698.56 --> 2705.2
actually not objects

2701.119 --> 2706.7200000000003
but holographic effects pure light-based

2705.2 --> 2711.2
unique

2706.72 --> 2711.2
unique two-person phenomena

2711.839 --> 2716.0
that cannot be traced back to a

2713.76 --> 2718.2400000000002
euclidean position over earth or

2716.0 --> 2722.0
anywhere

2718.24 --> 2724.64
and they behave like holograms would

2722.0 --> 2727.44
like if you're getting too close to them

2724.64 --> 2727.44
they dissipate

2727.52 --> 2733.119
or they bend away

2729.119 --> 2734.6400000000003
all all typical holographic phenomena

2733.119 --> 2735.599
all side effects of

2734.64 --> 2738.319
what we

2735.599 --> 2741.44
would associate with purely optical

2738.319 --> 2744.079
illusion type effects

2741.44 --> 2746.64
right now an optical illusion is of

2744.079 --> 2749.28
course still light no matter how it

2746.64 --> 2750.56
comes to be it's light and light has

2749.28 --> 2752.96
energy

2750.56 --> 2754.88
even if it is holographic and that

2752.96 --> 2757.28
energy is still arriving we're still

2754.88 --> 2759.119
absorbing light it still has a

2757.28 --> 2761.52
effect

2759.119 --> 2763.44
locally

2761.52 --> 2765.839
because there is light being absorbed no

2763.44 --> 2767.599
matter the origin of it

2765.839 --> 2769.2799999999997
right that doesn't really matter the

2767.599 --> 2771.92
light is being absorbed

2769.28 --> 2774.1600000000003
but that is not proof

2771.92 --> 2778.56
that any of these celestial lights are

2774.16 --> 2782.24
euclidean objects like lamps

2778.56 --> 2784.319
from anywhere shining all that distance

2782.24 --> 2785.5989999999997
towards us and that's how we receive

2784.319 --> 2787.599
light there's no evidence for that

2785.599 --> 2791.48
whatsoever there's actually quite a lot

2787.599 --> 2791.48
of evidence to the contrary

2811.119 --> 2816.76
calculated this

2813.28 --> 2816.76
oh my god

2842.0 --> 2847.64
all right you're outta here you're just

2844.48 --> 2847.64
a heckler

2879.119 --> 2884.8
all right yeah let me address

2882.8 --> 2886.7200000000003
the big one there i know he's engaging

2884.8 --> 2890.6400000000003
with a conversation with somebody else

2886.72 --> 2890.64
in my chat as they all like to do

2891.76 --> 2895.92
yeah

2892.64 --> 2899.52
ships were moving over a curved surface

2895.92 --> 2901.04
then they would disappear bottom first

2899.52 --> 2903.28
and then

2901.04 --> 2905.599
they yeah that disappearance would

2903.28 --> 2907.92
increase exponentially

2905.599 --> 2909.599
as they disappeared behind the geometric

2907.92 --> 2911.6800000000003
horizon

2909.599 --> 2912.559
would become more steep over distance

2911.68 --> 2916.24
and

2912.559 --> 2917.6800000000003
on top of that there would be no case

2916.24 --> 2921.5989999999997
whatsoever

2917.68 --> 2923.9199999999996
that you would be able to zoom in on

2921.599 --> 2926.4
that horizon with a camera

2923.92 --> 2930.2400000000002
and then have that boat

2926.4 --> 2934.8
revealed again once it was

2930.24 --> 2936.5589999999997
obstructed by the geometric horizon

2934.8 --> 2938.079
does that happen in the real world the

2936.559 --> 2940.079
big one

2938.079 --> 2941.04
does it

2940.079 --> 2943.3590000000004
or

2941.04 --> 2945.44
you actually zoom in on it and suddenly

2943.359 --> 2948.5589999999997
you see it again

2945.44 --> 2952.04
like was demonstrated innumerable times

2948.559 --> 2952.0400000000004
even in 2015.

2952.64 --> 2958.5589999999997
yeah i know that's never happened

2956.079 --> 2961.119
i i know

2958.559 --> 2964.8
we zoom in

2961.119 --> 2967.6800000000003
on boats that looked like they went over

2964.8 --> 2970.319
the horizon disappeared into it we zoom

2967.68 --> 2972.8799999999997
in on those boats all the time with

2970.319 --> 2976.5589999999997
cameras on the beach and then you see

2972.88 --> 2978.6400000000003
the boat again it happens all the time

2976.559 --> 2982.599
because of the resolution limit

2978.64 --> 2982.5989999999997
as i explained before

2987.599 --> 2992.48
otherwise you could simply zoom in on

2989.92 --> 2994.2400000000002
the sun after it has set

2992.48 --> 2995.76
and see the lighting well that's funny

2994.24 --> 2998.3999999999996
that you mention it because there is

2995.76 --> 2999.76
actually signs that that does happen

2998.4 --> 3001.52
but

2999.76 --> 3003.3590000000004
it doesn't really matter anything

3001.52 --> 3005.28
because the sun is purely holographic

3003.359 --> 3007.359
and it's not a

3005.28 --> 3010.7200000000003
a lamp

3007.359 --> 3013.68
hanging at a specific euclidean distance

3010.72 --> 3015.7599999999998
from a disc moving in a circle that's

3013.68 --> 3017.359
not what the sun is

3015.76 --> 3020.7200000000003
if it were

3017.359 --> 3023.839
then we'd see angular speed changes of

3020.72 --> 3026.8799999999997
the sun's pathway during a single day

3023.839 --> 3030.0789999999997
time because as it was moving into the

3026.88 --> 3032.559
assumed distance over the flat earth

3030.079 --> 3034.96
in that circle

3032.559 --> 3037.0400000000004
the angular speed would have to decrease

3034.96 --> 3040.079
to the viewer

3037.04 --> 3042.72
because it is an object going into the

3040.079 --> 3045.52
distance and when objects go into the

3042.72 --> 3046.72
distance at a persistent speed an actual

3045.52 --> 3049.92
speed

3046.72 --> 3054.0
assumed in a euclidean space

3049.92 --> 3056.48
then the to the viewer the angular speed

3054.0 --> 3058.96
angular speed is going to decrease this

3056.48 --> 3061.92
happens as part of perspective it

3058.96 --> 3064.7200000000003
happens to actual objects

3061.92 --> 3067.359
that go into the distance

3064.72 --> 3070.0789999999997
their speed decreases exponentially

3067.359 --> 3071.68
until the observer can no longer

3070.079 --> 3076.319
make out

3071.68 --> 3076.319
the object due to a lack of resolution

3076.96 --> 3083.2
yeah the angular speed would would alter

3080.8 --> 3085.28
if the sun was actually an object in

3083.2 --> 3087.68
euclidean space

3085.28 --> 3089.6800000000003
moving into the distance it doesn't the

3087.68 --> 3091.359
angular speed of the sun is very

3089.68 --> 3093.68
consistent

3091.359 --> 3097.48
only supporting once again it is a

3093.68 --> 3097.48
holographic phenomenon

3099.839 --> 3105.48
and not actually an object in the

3101.839 --> 3105.48
euclidean position

3114.89 --> 3118.0299999999997
[Music]

3120.88 --> 3125.48
dude get the hell out of here

3131.839 --> 3139.5589999999997
where are the flat earthers at dude i'm

3134.8 --> 3139.559
being snowed under by gammas here

3152.079 --> 3156.96
yeah yeah are you one for a unit that's

3154.16 --> 3158.319
a good point thank you see i do need

3156.96 --> 3161.04
others

3158.319 --> 3164.64
i can reflect upon that focus more right

3161.04 --> 3167.04
so then get caught up in the gamma swirl

3164.64 --> 3169.2
it's very distracting need other people

3167.04 --> 3171.44
to say things too

3169.2 --> 3174.64
right yes distortion of this and objects

3171.44 --> 3176.2400000000002
from the bottom up is not evidence for

3174.64 --> 3179.04
c curve

3176.24 --> 3181.68
right because an actual geometric curve

3179.04 --> 3184.04
of a spherical nature

3181.68 --> 3186.7999999999997
would cause objects to

3184.04 --> 3189.7599999999998
exponentially drop

3186.8 --> 3192.8
once it's beyond the geometric horizon

3189.76 --> 3195.3590000000004
exponentially drop consistently

3192.8 --> 3197.52
and they don't

3195.359 --> 3199.68
they don't do that

3197.52 --> 3203.28
right instead and this is something that

3199.68 --> 3206.3999999999996
i've identified at the very very start

3203.28 --> 3209.2000000000003
three years ago now i think maybe for

3206.4 --> 3211.359
the optical slant

3209.2 --> 3214.3999999999996
that's what happens that's the

3211.359 --> 3215.7599999999998
how you perceive these things over the

3214.4 --> 3217.44
flat earth

3215.76 --> 3221.0400000000004
which it is

3217.44 --> 3223.04
right there's no linear drop rate

3221.04 --> 3226.0
i mean there's no exponential drop rate

3223.04 --> 3229.44
the drop rate is linear that means it

3226.0 --> 3232.24
doesn't go over a curve

3229.44 --> 3234.319
because the drop rate that bottom

3232.24 --> 3238.4799999999996
disappearance thing that you see you

3234.319 --> 3240.319
know that would increase exponentially

3238.48 --> 3241.76
very rapidly

3240.319 --> 3243.68
it doesn't

3241.76 --> 3246.0
instead what you get to see is an

3243.68 --> 3248.319
optical slant effect

3246.0 --> 3251.44
horizon an apparent

3248.319 --> 3253.2
place where things seem to obstruct

3251.44 --> 3255.599
and then things

3253.2 --> 3259.2799999999997
going into the distance and then

3255.599 --> 3261.92
very slowly gradually at a linear rate

3259.28 --> 3264.6400000000003
starting to obstruct bottom up

3261.92 --> 3266.559
that's what you get to see the optical

3264.64 --> 3269.52
slant effect and it's

3266.559 --> 3269.52
get out of here man

3269.92 --> 3274.7200000000003
right i have a picture of this a very

3271.92 --> 3276.799
silly little sketch that i've used for

3274.72 --> 3278.72
years now

3276.799 --> 3282.48
i'm proud of how

3278.72 --> 3286.5589999999997
sketchy it looks it is correct though

3282.48 --> 3286.559
i'm gonna represent it again

3290.48 --> 3293.48
okay

3298.0 --> 3300.799
there you go

3301.28 --> 3305.1600000000003
that's what it looks like

3313.76 --> 3317.92
that's my own

3316.079 --> 3319.8390000000004
empirical finding

3317.92 --> 3320.96
my own testing

3319.839 --> 3322.24
my own

3320.96 --> 3324.16
modeling

3322.24 --> 3326.72
for the optics

3324.16 --> 3326.72
from a

3328.359 --> 3333.52
descriptive sense so this is not like

3331.68 --> 3336.0
mathematical

3333.52 --> 3338.72
or even geometric or even about lenses

3336.0 --> 3339.839
or anything this is about

3338.72 --> 3343.04
how you

3339.839 --> 3345.68
could how you effectively experience

3343.04 --> 3348.96
what you see that's what this diagram

3345.68 --> 3351.2799999999997
was about

3348.96 --> 3353.839
and i named it the optical slant because

3351.28 --> 3357.52
the obstruction rate after things start

3353.839 --> 3359.68
to obstruct bottom up due to optics

3357.52 --> 3363.24
right and how that actually works is a

3359.68 --> 3363.24
little bit more complex

3364.799 --> 3369.2
but that you start to experience that

3367.28 --> 3371.28
with things

3369.2 --> 3372.96
and as those things move into it the

3371.28 --> 3375.8390000000004
distance

3372.96 --> 3378.4
the that actual obstruction rate is

3375.839 --> 3379.7599999999998
linear that's why i call it an optical

3378.4 --> 3382.0
slant

3379.76 --> 3384.96
because it is like a

3382.0 --> 3388.0
a flat surface that is slightly

3384.96 --> 3390.799
turned apparently down that's what you

3388.0 --> 3393.44
experience it like the drop rate is not

3390.799 --> 3394.48
exponential as would be required

3393.44 --> 3396.559
if that

3394.48 --> 3399.76
effect that obstruction effect was

3396.559 --> 3400.96
caused by geometry

3399.76 --> 3403.119
right

3400.96 --> 3406.16
if it was caused by spherical geometry

3403.119 --> 3409.04
it would drop exponentially

3406.16 --> 3411.2
it doesn't the drop rate

3409.04 --> 3413.599
it's not a drop rate but the obstruction

3411.2 --> 3416.0
rate that is assumed to be drop rate by

3413.599 --> 3418.96
the ballers the obstruction rate is

3416.0 --> 3421.52
linear and that's why i call it a slant

3418.96 --> 3423.119
like it's slanting slightly downward

3421.52 --> 3424.799
apparently

3423.119 --> 3427.52
not actually

3424.799 --> 3429.839
it's purely an impression that's that's

3427.52 --> 3431.119
how it impresses

3429.839 --> 3434.799
the viewer

3431.119 --> 3434.799
that's what my diagram was about

3435.119 --> 3438.119
right

3458.48 --> 3461.48
foreign

3492.319 --> 3496.16
oh god does anybody still have one of

3494.48 --> 3499.2
those videos

3496.16 --> 3499.2
available anywhere

3500.16 --> 3505.04
didn't mitchell from australia do that

3502.72 --> 3509.52
like in one of his first shows

3505.04 --> 3509.52
first live streams didn't he do that

3510.88 --> 3513.76
because

3511.839 --> 3516.799
over the years people have done that all

3513.76 --> 3520.1600000000003
the time

3516.799 --> 3523.4
dude get out scumbag

3520.16 --> 3523.3999999999996
get out

3541.28 --> 3547.2000000000003
yes vessel over the edge behind the

3543.839 --> 3549.119
horizon yeah i know i've seen those too

3547.2 --> 3551.5989999999997
the thing is though

3549.119 --> 3554.7200000000003
the black swan effect the black swan

3551.599 --> 3555.599
argument still in place

3554.72 --> 3558.9599999999996
yeah

3555.599 --> 3561.2000000000003
so at some point an observer might have

3558.96 --> 3562.559
certain weather conditions

3561.2 --> 3563.5989999999997
where

3562.559 --> 3566.96
the

3563.599 --> 3569.6800000000003
objects including boats might seem to go

3566.96 --> 3570.7200000000003
and suddenly drop away and then guess

3569.68 --> 3573.2
what

3570.72 --> 3575.68
total blur

3573.2 --> 3578.0789999999997
because of limited sight that was also

3575.68 --> 3579.839
in the diagram by the way right air

3578.079 --> 3582.1600000000003
obstructs

3579.839 --> 3583.359
any cohesive light

3582.16 --> 3585.1189999999997
eventually

3583.359 --> 3587.119
after certain distance and depending on

3585.119 --> 3589.2000000000003
how thick the air is due to moist and

3587.119 --> 3590.319
all kinds of conditions

3589.2 --> 3593.68
the air

3590.319 --> 3596.96
blurs up closer by or further away and

3593.68 --> 3598.16
when it blurs up closer by then yeah oh

3596.96 --> 3600.0
look

3598.16 --> 3602.0789999999997
suddenly there's a miraging of the thing

3600.0 --> 3605.04
that goes down and it is gone and you

3602.079 --> 3607.44
don't see anything else either yeah i

3605.04 --> 3610.319
know that could be interpreted oh look

3607.44 --> 3612.2400000000002
something went over the curve anyway the

3610.319 --> 3613.2
problem is though there's plenty of

3612.24 --> 3615.52
footage

3613.2 --> 3618.319
where that doesn't happen and there is

3615.52 --> 3620.64
the linear obstruction rate

3618.319 --> 3622.799
well that on its own is a black swan

3620.64 --> 3623.7599999999998
effect

3622.799 --> 3626.64
because

3623.76 --> 3629.599
a geometry could never

3626.64 --> 3632.64
spherical geometry could never ever

3629.599 --> 3635.2000000000003
have those types of sightings

3632.64 --> 3636.5589999999997
see that sort of sighting is impossible

3635.2 --> 3639.359
on the globe

3636.559 --> 3642.559
so if you see that just once it's over

3639.359 --> 3644.0789999999997
the geometry has been defiled

3642.559 --> 3646.4
black swan

3644.079 --> 3647.92
you can't have that type of sighting on

3646.4 --> 3650.48
the globe

3647.92 --> 3652.64
that's mechanically impossible

3650.48 --> 3653.92
right just because you have a a couple

3652.64 --> 3656.0789999999997
of footage

3653.92 --> 3659.52
where it seems like it goes over the

3656.079 --> 3659.52
horizon and disappears

3659.76 --> 3663.599
and then oh look at this oh that's

3661.44 --> 3666.2400000000002
proved the globe oh yeah but there's

3663.599 --> 3668.48
that other footage that completely

3666.24 --> 3670.9599999999996
undoes that

3668.48 --> 3673.44
that makes that assertion that train of

3670.96 --> 3674.64
thinking impossible it cuts it off at

3673.44 --> 3678.64
the root

3674.64 --> 3678.64
because the geometry is defiled

3678.96 --> 3685.559
when you don't see that even once

3682.16 --> 3685.5589999999997
black swan

3687.76 --> 3691.0400000000004
your word

3689.04 --> 3692.64
dude

3691.04 --> 3694.4
could you just

3692.64 --> 3698.68
drop it already

3694.4 --> 3698.6800000000003
i don't need your gamma input

3706.799 --> 3708.96
no

3709.2 --> 3713.5989999999997
now the big one black swan look up the

3711.359 --> 3715.2799999999997
black swan photograph i have it on my

3713.599 --> 3716.6400000000003
computer by the way

3715.28 --> 3719.039
think

3716.64 --> 3721.52
should have

3719.039 --> 3724.6400000000003
right you just need one picture

3721.52 --> 3727.599
one picture and it's over

3724.64 --> 3729.1189999999997
one picture that defies the geometry and

3727.599 --> 3731.839
it's over

3729.119 --> 3734.319
and we have many many many of those

3731.839 --> 3734.319
pictures

3737.68 --> 3742.8799999999997
i think i downloaded one at least once i

3741.44 --> 3746.079
should have one

3742.88 --> 3746.079
otherwise i've been lazy

3746.799 --> 3751.599
and i could probably just go in discord

3748.88 --> 3753.6800000000003
look around browse around

3751.599 --> 3757.76
in the chats and and pick one out

3753.68 --> 3757.7599999999998
because it's constantly being reposted

3762.799 --> 3768.359
but yeah if you go to quantum eraser

3765.359 --> 3768.359
channel

3769.359 --> 3773.52
and you search in the titles for black

3772.079 --> 3776.6400000000003
swan

3773.52 --> 3779.2
he has many many hangouts where he lays

3776.64 --> 3780.4
out the black swan argument

3779.2 --> 3783.4399999999996
the

3780.4 --> 3785.6800000000003
background of it

3783.44 --> 3785.68
right

3788.0 --> 3793.76
and shows the pictures

3790.48 --> 3795.839
many times so if you want to know it's

3793.76 --> 3798.4
out there i'm not telling you to

3795.839 --> 3801.7599999999998
generally google it

3798.4 --> 3804.1600000000003
i have a specific channel for you

3801.76 --> 3807.2000000000003
quantum eraser

3804.16 --> 3810.16
he has many videos that are specifically

3807.2 --> 3813.52
about the black swan argument and has

3810.16 --> 3816.5589999999997
the photographs and everything in detail

3813.52 --> 3819.52
that is relevant including maths

3816.559 --> 3819.52
and all that right

3821.359 --> 3824.64
i'm not really a math guy

3823.68 --> 3826.8799999999997
but

3824.64 --> 3829.5989999999997
i do understand how things work

3826.88 --> 3829.599
mechanically

3836.079 --> 3839.599
black swan for

3837.839 --> 3842.0
what the hell are you blabbering about

3839.599 --> 3844.4
that's insane

3842.0 --> 3844.4
god

3845.359 --> 3848.839
get out of here

3853.359 --> 3857.44
no not

3854.48 --> 3859.839
the black swan photos specifically the

3857.44 --> 3863.68
ones that we typically use over at the

3859.839 --> 3863.68
flat earth debates and quantum eraser

3864.0 --> 3868.88
those are not actually still photos they

3867.039 --> 3872.079
are

3868.88 --> 3876.079
high like cut outs

3872.079 --> 3877.44
of actual live running footage

3876.079 --> 3879.6800000000003
where the person

3877.44 --> 3881.52
is on the beach

3879.68 --> 3883.359
zoomed out

3881.52 --> 3885.119
you can see where he is you can see

3883.359 --> 3888.48
where everything is in relation to them

3885.119 --> 3891.52
zoomed out and then he zooms in

3888.48 --> 3892.4
then you get to see the sight that was

3891.52 --> 3895.52
later

3892.4 --> 3897.92
framed cut out and presented as this is

3895.52 --> 3900.24
the black swan photograph

3897.92 --> 3901.28
that's actually taken from live rolled

3900.24 --> 3904.0
footage

3901.28 --> 3906.0
okay live recorded

3904.0 --> 3909.24
it's not fake

3906.0 --> 3909.24
it's ridiculous

3911.52 --> 3917.0389999999998
and it's not the only footage by the way

3913.359 --> 3921.4
there's more of that type of footage

3917.039 --> 3921.4
one for the unit hey what's that

3926.079 --> 3930.799
full zoom boats on the horizon oh cool

3932.24 --> 3936.359
man this channel has ads

3954.96 --> 3957.359
okay

3958.559 --> 3962.1600000000003
it's not super helpful

3963.68 --> 3969.839
it's a very blurry day

3967.119 --> 3969.839
in that link

3970.96 --> 3974.52
thanks for trying

3995.28 --> 3997.6800000000003
okay

3999.359 --> 4003.0789999999997
who was it again

4012.559 --> 4015.559
so

4043.28 --> 4046.28
hmm

4058.24 --> 4061.24
what

4063.92 --> 4066.16
huh

4075.52 --> 4078.96
oh wait it's in the wrong order

4079.52 --> 4085.24
okay let me find it

4081.44 --> 4085.2400000000002
where's the black swan

4110.4 --> 4114.3189999999995
all right i'll just

4112.159 --> 4118.3589999999995
get this one

4114.319 --> 4118.359
mark platz el cadilla

4124.239 --> 4129.5199999999995
yeah kiwi's

4125.839 --> 4131.679
playlist for ball busters is a mess

4129.52 --> 4132.88
but whatever

4131.679 --> 4135.839
here we got

4132.88 --> 4138.319
a two hour show

4135.839 --> 4140.96
where the black swan is is definitely

4138.319 --> 4143.04
gonna be explained referenced in many

4140.96 --> 4144.88
many ways because that's the theme of

4143.04 --> 4146.4
the show

4144.88 --> 4148.4800000000005
undoubtedly

4146.4 --> 4150.48
the black swan footage is going to be

4148.48 --> 4154.08
showed as well

4150.48 --> 4156.639999999999
this would be ridiculous if it wasn't

4154.08 --> 4156.64
so yeah

4156.799 --> 4161.839
here's a good source for black swan

4159.44 --> 4161.839
data

4190.319 --> 4193.319
so

4224.0 --> 4228.8
glow proof is that coming soon

4226.56 --> 4231.76
i don't think so

4228.8 --> 4233.92
i think instead

4231.76 --> 4235.6
they're going to delve deeper into

4233.92 --> 4237.36
double think

4235.6 --> 4238.88
right they're already doing it so much

4237.36 --> 4240.5599999999995
it's just everything is going to be

4238.88 --> 4242.0
switched inside out

4240.56 --> 4244.719
whenever it is or that's what the

4242.0 --> 4247.28
anti-flat earthers do

4244.719 --> 4249.44
that go for the

4247.28 --> 4253.199
virtual globe mechanics

4249.44 --> 4255.04
that defies logic and reason

4253.199 --> 4257.44
they're gonna do that

4255.04 --> 4260.0
double think and speak they're gonna try

4257.44 --> 4261.44
to normalize double thing right they're

4260.0 --> 4264.159
already doing that but they're gonna

4261.44 --> 4266.639999999999
like make it even worse

4264.159 --> 4268.159
it's gonna hurt them a lot

4266.64 --> 4270.320000000001
like

4268.159 --> 4272.159
they're gonna create if they haven't

4270.32 --> 4273.759999999999
already physically experienced it

4272.159 --> 4276.08
they're going to create

4273.76 --> 4278.719
by doubling down on that

4276.08 --> 4281.04
like effects of amnesia because when you

4278.719 --> 4283.199
double think that deeply it's almost

4281.04 --> 4286.88
like you literally become demented but

4283.199 --> 4288.239
it's like spiritually demented it's

4286.88 --> 4290.400000000001
it's just

4288.239 --> 4292.48
you don't see it anymore because you've

4290.4 --> 4294.48
double thinked too much

4292.48 --> 4297.759999999999
you lost your mind

4294.48 --> 4297.759999999999
that's what they used to say

4298.0 --> 4302.0
literally losing your mind because of

4300.0 --> 4305.76
the double thing well they're going

4302.0 --> 4307.04
there and they will feel the price

4305.76 --> 4308.88
because

4307.04 --> 4310.96
that's part of the design that's how

4308.88 --> 4313.52
things work when you do that you have a

4310.96 --> 4317.0
price this is going to be the price

4313.52 --> 4317.0
laying it out

4331.6 --> 4334.96
is the black swan put through the

4333.12 --> 4337.44
scientific method it's not a scientific

4334.96 --> 4337.44
argument

4340.56 --> 4343.52
it's

4341.6 --> 4345.92
logical

4343.52 --> 4348.56
inference

4345.92 --> 4349.92
based on geometric consequences

4348.56 --> 4351.4400000000005
and sightings

4349.92 --> 4353.1990000000005
right

4351.44 --> 4355.36
it's not scientific

4353.199 --> 4358.48
doesn't need to be scientific

4355.36 --> 4358.48
it's just logic

4368.64 --> 4375.360000000001
i anomaly no that's ridiculous

4372.239 --> 4378.239
no your geometry is not an anomaly

4375.36 --> 4380.5599999999995
geometry has consequences when those

4378.239 --> 4382.718999999999
consequences are violated

4380.56 --> 4384.719
just once it's over

4382.719 --> 4385.52
it's not that geometry

4384.719 --> 4389.6
right

4385.52 --> 4391.84
you can't optically violate a geometry

4389.6 --> 4394.88
optics are always secondary so if the

4391.84 --> 4398.08
geometry is violated

4394.88 --> 4401.6
then it's not that geometry

4398.08 --> 4401.6
optics are always secondary

4403.12 --> 4406.0
so

4404.56 --> 4408.320000000001
i'm sorry

4406.0 --> 4410.8
black swan stands

4408.32 --> 4413.599999999999
the earth is not a sphere

4410.8 --> 4416.08
if it was we wouldn't have the black

4413.6 --> 4418.4800000000005
swan sightings

4416.08 --> 4421.04
you wouldn't be able to see things at

4418.48 --> 4423.12
extreme distances from very low

4421.04 --> 4425.36
observation height that would never be

4423.12 --> 4428.4
able you would never be able to under

4425.36 --> 4428.4
any circumstances

4429.12 --> 4435.5199999999995
the geometry has been defiled it's not

4431.679 --> 4439.0
as fair i'm sorry black swan it's over

4435.52 --> 4439.0
it's over

4442.96 --> 4447.36
[Music]

4444.48 --> 4447.36
oh my god

4447.84 --> 4453.56
get the hell out of here

4450.56 --> 4453.56
numpties

4458.64 --> 4461.64
so

4464.74 --> 4468.09
[Music]

4485.199 --> 4489.199
that's right george sanford not in one

4487.199 --> 4490.639999999999
measurement of a sphere ever that's

4489.199 --> 4492.96
right

4490.64 --> 4496.84
they don't even have an r value they

4492.96 --> 4496.84
just presuppose it

4497.199 --> 4505.759999999999
they calculate how it should be a sphere

4501.6 --> 4505.76
or they try to mechanize

4506.239 --> 4510.718999999999
how

4507.52 --> 4513.76
the non-sphere sighting

4510.719 --> 4516.0
would be a sphere anyway

4513.76 --> 4518.08
by twisting the very fabric of how

4516.0 --> 4520.08
things work through the machination

4518.08 --> 4521.92
right that's how terrestrial refraction

4520.08 --> 4525.5199999999995
came into being

4521.92 --> 4528.159
that crazy paradoxical argument

4525.52 --> 4530.64
that makes it completely and utterly

4528.159 --> 4532.879999999999
impossible to ever establish a radius of

4530.64 --> 4532.88
earth

4533.28 --> 4536.5599999999995
right

4534.239 --> 4538.08
if you think terrestrial refraction is

4536.56 --> 4540.88
real

4538.08 --> 4542.88
then you can't establish an r value even

4540.88 --> 4545.52
though it's presupposed in the very

4542.88 --> 4549.12
machination itself

4545.52 --> 4550.56
and if you relinquish

4549.12 --> 4552.08
that you don't have terrestrial

4550.56 --> 4555.1990000000005
refraction because you don't it's a

4552.08 --> 4556.719
machination then there is the black swan

4555.199 --> 4560.239
observations

4556.719 --> 4562.88
which defile the geometry

4560.239 --> 4565.44
no matter what you do you're stuck the

4562.88 --> 4568.56
earth is not as fair

4565.44 --> 4571.5199999999995
it never will be it never was

4568.56 --> 4573.04
you can't twist reality and make it into

4571.52 --> 4575.84
a sphere anyway

4573.04 --> 4578.159
because you'd run into mechanical dead

4575.84 --> 4578.159000000001
ends

4578.56 --> 4583.92
either you have a black swan

4581.44 --> 4586.239
that defiles the geometry

4583.92 --> 4588.32
or you have your bendy light terrestrial

4586.239 --> 4591.5199999999995
refraction and then you can't establish

4588.32 --> 4591.5199999999995
an r value ever

4591.6 --> 4597.4400000000005
even though you're presupposing it

4593.52 --> 4599.52
becomes a deadlock paradox

4597.44 --> 4602.4
those are the only two options there's

4599.52 --> 4605.4400000000005
not even an in-between anything it's

4602.4 --> 4609.32
just those two it's that dichotomy that

4605.44 --> 4609.32
true dichotomy

4609.52 --> 4616.0
it's done

4610.96 --> 4618.4
the earth is not a sphere it cannot be

4616.0 --> 4620.239
either the black swan defiles your

4618.4 --> 4622.96
geometry

4620.239 --> 4626.159
or you have no r value

4622.96 --> 4626.159
and you will never have it

4627.84 --> 4632.1990000000005
you're stuck

4628.96 --> 4632.199
it's over

4643.84 --> 4646.84
ah

4665.679 --> 4669.92
fortune you think that's fortunate for

4667.84 --> 4671.6
them

4669.92 --> 4674.719
of course dylan

4671.6 --> 4674.719
no i pity them

4674.96 --> 4679.36
i can't imagine anything worse than to

4677.44 --> 4680.879999999999
not care about the truth

4679.36 --> 4682.799999999999
not even from a consciousness

4680.88 --> 4684.96
perspective but just because of the

4682.8 --> 4688.2390000000005
consequences

4684.96 --> 4692.28
what it does to you to your dignity

4688.239 --> 4692.28
to your mental faculties

4692.48 --> 4696.879999999999
it's terrible

4694.96 --> 4699.52
not caring about truth

4696.88 --> 4702.32
terrible it's hell you live through hell

4699.52 --> 4703.6
you literally pay the price li in life

4702.32 --> 4707.04
in dreams

4703.6 --> 4708.8
you pay the price you enter hell because

4707.04 --> 4711.92
you abandon truth

4708.8 --> 4713.679
and truth first and foremost is god

4711.92 --> 4716.88
that's the frequency of god that's where

4713.679 --> 4718.56
it all comes from from god

4716.88 --> 4720.8
and he is in truth

4718.56 --> 4724.159000000001
and so if you abandon it you literally

4720.8 --> 4726.96
abandon on an esoteric level god

4724.159 --> 4729.96
and god does not take kindly to being

4726.96 --> 4729.96
abandoned

4737.76 --> 4740.76
ah

4752.96 --> 4757.36
right because everybody in their life

4755.6 --> 4759.52
will have moments where they will step

4757.36 --> 4761.5199999999995
away from god where they can't handle

4759.52 --> 4763.92
the truth you know the famous movie

4761.52 --> 4765.92
quote can't handle the truth yeah that

4763.92 --> 4767.92
happens that happens to almost everybody

4765.92 --> 4770.159
no matter how intelligent you are or

4767.92 --> 4773.12
pretend to be it always happens to

4770.159 --> 4774.08
everybody at some point in their life

4773.12 --> 4776.4
right

4774.08 --> 4779.36
that's not a problem

4776.4 --> 4782.48
the problem is is when you step away

4779.36 --> 4785.199
and then you don't go back

4782.48 --> 4786.799999999999
you don't overcome the mistake

4785.199 --> 4789.199
when you don't overcome your mistake

4786.8 --> 4790.64
when you refuse to realize it even is a

4789.199 --> 4794.0
mistake

4790.64 --> 4795.360000000001
then you become that mistake it starts

4794.0 --> 4798.239
to shape you

4795.36 --> 4798.239
how you function

4798.32 --> 4801.84
and then

4799.52 --> 4802.88
if you don't even try to get out of it

4801.84 --> 4806.56
then

4802.88 --> 4806.56
the mistake becomes you

4809.04 --> 4813.199
you become defined by the mistake

4813.6 --> 4817.6
it forms you

4815.04 --> 4819.84
that's how others then see you by the

4817.6 --> 4819.84
mistake

4824.08 --> 4829.199
so yeah abandoning truth don't do it

4826.56 --> 4832.1990000000005
it's a terrible decision it's not worth

4829.199 --> 4832.199
it

4836.8 --> 4840.2390000000005
right i'm gonna round out the show

4840.8 --> 4844.56
lots of trolls in today

4842.719 --> 4846.32
but it was doable hey and it didn't even

4844.56 --> 4850.080000000001
get angry a single time isn't that

4846.32 --> 4852.5599999999995
something i'm doing great i think

4850.08 --> 4855.679
maybe even a bit too still maybe i'm

4852.56 --> 4855.679
getting too stoic

4856.0 --> 4861.92
i'm so still weak no i'm not

4859.6 --> 4864.96
