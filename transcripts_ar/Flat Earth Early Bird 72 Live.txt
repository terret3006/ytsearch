3.74 --> 11.16
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.47 --> 19.22
early-bird number 72 I'm your host

11.16 --> 24.98
Arwen and today is quite a day clear sky

19.22 --> 24.979999999999997
very sunny very cold see it

33.059 --> 43.89
and she'll still see the ice on the

36.03 --> 50.25
roofs over there yesterday was quite

43.89 --> 58.29
crazy wasn't it yeah yeah to the fair I

50.25 --> 60.75
was quite Restless yesterday well that

58.29 --> 66.6
was quite obvious and afterwards I

60.75 --> 70.039
thought like oh [ __ ] did I go too far

66.6 --> 76.05
and then watch it again until be fair no

70.039 --> 80.28
no it was specific and it was heartfelt

76.05 --> 82.11
and yeah the troll videos are already

80.28 --> 87.2
popping up so yeah that was to be

82.11 --> 89.72
expected is what it is I hope that

87.2 --> 94.92
despite it it's

89.72 --> 98.39
mm-hmm inflammatory nature it resonated

94.92 --> 98.39
with people it is a real issue

99.6 --> 109.19999999999999
so yeah also coincidentally I got

106.29 --> 113.58000000000001
confirmation of my monetization so yeah

109.2 --> 118.2
that's that's there now and just have to

113.58 --> 120.24
see some other things I need yeah I can

118.2 --> 123.92
technically enable the super chat but I

120.24 --> 127.11
have to register a company for that so

123.92 --> 132.649
yeah I can do that right away but it

127.11 --> 132.649
will be initialized as soon as possible

134.61 --> 137.3
so

139.28 --> 145.31
it's trying to stay calm today to be

142.7 --> 150.61999999999998
fair yeah man I've been going through my

145.31 --> 153.73
head over and over again like to

150.62 --> 156.89000000000001
understand that that rant came from

153.73 --> 163.32999999999998
reflections of what I'm seeing in the

156.89 --> 163.32999999999998
world and what I saw in the dark world

164.93 --> 172.43
putting it all together

168.02 --> 175.36
it's just it's wrong it's becoming miss

172.43 --> 175.36
functional and

179.349 --> 185.95999999999998
and there is probably

182.39 --> 189.44
a reflection of what I felt inside the

185.96 --> 191.47
entire well if you can even consider it

189.44 --> 194.72
a unified thing anymore the left-wing

191.47 --> 197.33
they know it a lot of that those people

194.72 --> 200.72
are probably just a sick of this is

197.33 --> 204.59
happening these people on top in control

200.72 --> 207.47
of their direction their group just

204.59 --> 211.34
screwing it up and not having too much

207.47 --> 213.34
money to they have too much money for

211.34 --> 218.23
them to do anything about it

213.34 --> 218.23
Monica just died on me what

224.49 --> 230.81
okay something for some reason I wanted

227.52 --> 230.81
to return offensive weird

235.03 --> 238.8
all right okay it's back

243.48 --> 246.82999999999998
and yeah

247.58 --> 257.93
left I always remembered it as being

252.94 --> 262.13
about equality well do we really need

257.93 --> 264.29
that right now because yeah there it's

262.13 --> 268.7
been widely adopted pretty much

264.29 --> 272.83000000000004
everybody agrees now on this so this

268.7 --> 277.96999999999997
over doing that [ __ ] the Marxism the

272.83 --> 281.63
social D railing the natural state that

277.97 --> 285.05
is completely superfluous it is used it

281.63 --> 287.36
is destructive it needs to go away but

285.05 --> 290.99
the environmental part now that's

287.36 --> 295.43
another thing there's a lot to be done

290.99 --> 299.45
here and traditionally the left would

295.43 --> 302.6
always be the people that go against

299.45 --> 305.15
animal cruelty of course that will

302.6 --> 309.44
remain an issue for a long time to go

305.15 --> 313.96999999999997
there's a lot of philosophical debating

309.44 --> 318.02
that will happen continued to happen but

313.97 --> 321.8
nature like forests unique natural

318.02 --> 325.15999999999997
places unique life preserving that

321.8 --> 329.33
natural preservation nature preservation

325.16 --> 333.89000000000004
that it is becoming increasingly more

329.33 --> 336.32
important as humans develop the

333.89 --> 337.14
technology and the industry more and

336.32 --> 339.33
more

337.14 --> 344.71999999999997
and at the same time the population is

339.33 --> 348.65999999999997
increasing whether we like it or not and

344.72 --> 351.66
yeah just if you just think about it

348.66 --> 355.53000000000003
this history has proven now that every

351.66 --> 359.63000000000005
time from whatever angle if you attack a

355.53 --> 364.28999999999996
group to try and get something away

359.63 --> 366.45
it rarely succeeds and when it doesn't

364.29 --> 369.51000000000005
succeed it actually has an opposite

366.45 --> 376.7
effect that group always bounces back

369.51 --> 378.28999999999996
stronger so yeah we look the old

376.7 --> 382.4
European elites

378.29 --> 385.11
that were racist yeah they were that's

382.4 --> 388.60999999999996
really out there in the past

385.11 --> 391.83000000000004
pretty much although there's some I

388.61 --> 393.90000000000003
guess it's kind of trendy on the super

391.83 --> 396.3
high elites or whatever so it said I

393.9 --> 399.23999999999995
can't even confirm this really but it

396.3 --> 403.2
might be might be them just trolling us

399.24 --> 408.42
I don't know but in the old days yeah

403.2 --> 411.51
that was there and for some extent to

408.42 --> 416.76
some reason but it's still a short

411.51 --> 418.57
sighted bunch of reasons really and they

416.76 --> 422.19
attacked

418.57 --> 422.19
Africans for example

423.199 --> 428.27000000000004
constantly causing Wars although yeah

425.81 --> 430.969
there it is said okay there were Wars

428.27 --> 432.979
but why were they there how was that

430.969 --> 434.779
culture couldn't that ever be in a

432.979 --> 437.9
stable culture well if you keep on

434.779 --> 439.879
attacking and attacking and bending

437.9 --> 442.729
people to attack each other then they

439.879 --> 445.09900000000005
will become a warlike people and the

442.729 --> 448.24899999999997
warlike people will always get more kids

445.099 --> 452.06
because they need more warriors and if

448.249 --> 458.11
you and Graeme that long enough over the

452.06 --> 462.949
ages then they will become what they are

458.11 --> 467.3
so that's stupid it's stupid to do that

462.949 --> 470.319
it's not a good methodology ever if you

467.3 --> 470.319
want to get rid of something

470.68 --> 477.389
you gotta make sure that it becomes in a

474.97 --> 481.6
way that you don't want to get rid of it

477.389 --> 484.75
that's the real solution and it is

481.6 --> 488.35
proven industrialization stabilize

484.75 --> 491.79
population but there's a risk

488.35 --> 495.61
reindustrialization because yeah nature

491.79 --> 499.0
will nature make way can it can that

495.61 --> 500.97900000000004
happen and if it's not gonna happen

499.0 --> 504.58
yeah nature is still gonna give way you

500.979 --> 506.289
know more chaotic people more ruthless

504.58 --> 510.07
people they don't give a [ __ ] about

506.289 --> 512.02
nature Barbary isn't 10th not to they

510.07 --> 516.669
have other priorities short-term

512.02 --> 518.71
survival and such so it's gonna go that

516.669 --> 521.65
direction so what can you do about it

518.71 --> 529.83
well you can industrialize and use the

521.65 --> 529.8299999999999
real modern powers that are big finances

529.84 --> 540.37
efficient modern relatively

533.29 --> 543.3199999999999
environmentally safe industry to prevent

540.37 --> 545.39
all the nastiness to prevent that

543.32 --> 547.85
destruction to give nature some

545.39 --> 549.74
breathing room and give the people some

547.85 --> 552.59
breathing room at the same time that's

549.74 --> 558.5600000000001
the way it should be applied we know

552.59 --> 563.9
this now so let's do that and stop stop

558.56 --> 567.9499999999999
the hammering hammering because it

563.9 --> 571.24
doesn't work the hammering only makes it

567.95 --> 574.19
harder it's like steel when you tamper

571.24 --> 577.3100000000001
when you started ramming on on a bar of

574.19 --> 582.08
iron it will become more compact more

577.31 --> 585.38
hard and possibly sharp where before it

582.08 --> 588.86
was just its weight and you could still

585.38 --> 592.76
bend it right so if you're gonna hammer

588.86 --> 595.3000000000001
on something it's gonna be tempered it's

592.76 --> 597.17
gonna get harder it's gonna be tougher

595.3 --> 599.5899999999999
stop doing that

597.17 --> 599.5899999999999
idiots

600.68 --> 603.79
let's just calm down

604.45 --> 610.7700000000001
fix it all together let's get to the

606.88 --> 614.49
real issues let's get the real problems

610.77 --> 619.93
balanced reasonability

614.49 --> 622.3
breathing room to grow and challenging

619.93 --> 625.78
the ego within because of the ego within

622.3 --> 628.39
and was said a couple of times and yeah

625.78 --> 629.88
now it is kind of oversimplified when I

628.39 --> 634.36
hear that and I used to say it myself

629.88 --> 638.5
get rid of the ego well no that's never

634.36 --> 641.95
gonna work because the ego is the it is

638.5 --> 647.14
part of the design can't get rid of it

641.95 --> 651.3100000000001
unless you lose being a human but we can

647.14 --> 654.01
grasp and grow as we grow outside inside

651.31 --> 658.18
and learn how to deal with it more learn

654.01 --> 661.72
what to expect and teach our children

658.18 --> 664.8889999999999
and each other how to deal with that and

661.72 --> 667.5590000000001
what to expect

664.889 --> 671.879
and the illusions that come with the the

667.559 --> 674.939
short-term gains like because that is

671.879 --> 679.649
really what it is that the ego forces

674.939 --> 684.1189999999999
you to decide things closer to you

679.649 --> 686.97
more for you for your short-term so if

684.119 --> 689.669
there is this big overarching thing that

686.97 --> 693.48
just surpasses just your life and it is

689.669 --> 695.519
very burdensome then the ego will tell

693.48 --> 697.3190000000001
you now that's all [ __ ] it's not

695.519 --> 700.079
relevant to you you're just gonna be

697.319 --> 703.41
there right so just make sure that that

700.079 --> 708.019
period is okay and screw the rest that's

703.41 --> 714.319
what the ego does and that ruins so much

708.019 --> 718.559
so it must be tempered by ourselves

714.319 --> 720.6289999999999
through wisdom through understanding

718.559 --> 725.879
what is happening inside of us to make

720.629 --> 729.929
these decisions okay not by forcing it

725.879 --> 732.4490000000001
away by reprogramming you into a drone

729.929 --> 735.449
that just follows complete nonsensical

732.449 --> 737.2199999999999
rules like putting somebody in a puzzle

735.449 --> 739.769
they can't solve so they're just

737.22 --> 742.019
disabled that doesn't work just creates

739.769 --> 744.179
more chaos the ego is gonna try to break

742.019 --> 746.429
through and probably through with

744.179 --> 749.999
violence and actual destruction that's

746.429 --> 756.31
madness so it has to be tempered with

749.999 --> 759.73
wisdom and knowledge and peace

756.31 --> 762.569
because when does do the real awakening

759.73 --> 762.5690000000001
the real

765.05 --> 771.14
the shifts the consciousness shifts

767.27 --> 775.87
happen with peace actual peace peace

771.14 --> 778.97
that is sensible not a waiting line but

775.87 --> 782.12
solving things and then having real

778.97 --> 785.45
peace and then everything again grows

782.12 --> 787.1
and changes new problems arrive and

785.45 --> 791.24
that's how it really works you move on

787.1 --> 793.34
to the next issue that is the the path

791.24 --> 795.47
of real wisdom that's how a person

793.34 --> 799.34
gathers wisdom over their life by so

795.47 --> 801.32
being confronted with problems that they

799.34 --> 802.76
can deal with that first and then

801.32 --> 805.49
learning to deal with them by

802.76 --> 808.88
understanding what it is finding a way

805.49 --> 811.51
and then getting a better oversight on

808.88 --> 811.51
the bigger picture

818.97 --> 823.5
so but yeah

823.61 --> 831.73
those out there that just I can't do it

827.48 --> 834.26
I have to continue doing this and

831.73 --> 838.1
doesn't make any sense I'm causing

834.26 --> 840.829
damage but very close by it just kind of

838.1 --> 843.38
feels good or I got these nice drugs

840.829 --> 846.5
that just can make me do what is

843.38 --> 850.519
technically the most efficient for my

846.5 --> 853.31
base wealth that kind of thing this is

850.519 --> 859.089
just nasty it is nasty don't do that

853.31 --> 859.0889999999999
it's it's madness needs to end

859.3 --> 867.769
get sensible get back take it back take

863.089 --> 872.8100000000001
your sensibility back take the pain let

867.769 --> 876.649
your soul ream an effect because soul is

872.81 --> 881.329
not just a burden it is a invaluable

876.649 --> 885.35
tool of reflection the essence of

881.329 --> 888.9799999999999
creation it is essential to gather true

885.35 --> 891.38
insight if you don't use it and the more

888.98 --> 893.149
parts about it you don't use it you get

891.38 --> 896.93
holes in your consciousness that's

893.149 --> 899.029
exactly what that does they create blind

896.93 --> 901.6099999999999
spots without the soul you get blind

899.029 --> 906.05
spots the deeper you go the bigger the

901.61 --> 910.11
blind spots become until it just doesn't

906.05 --> 914.519
make any sense anymore because yeah

910.11 --> 916.67
you need the soul to truly see it as it

914.519 --> 916.67
is

917.29 --> 920.3399999999999
think about that

927.75 --> 937.889
so I am open for guests I already put

933.029 --> 940.16
out the link in a panel so anyone's

937.889 --> 940.16
welcome

941.999 --> 947.0690000000001
yeah literally anyone Jose if he wants

946.889 --> 951.869
to

947.069 --> 955.259
although see about that don't threader

951.869 --> 957.47
you know what even you can join if you

955.259 --> 957.47
like

958.529 --> 966.049
or anyone else I am very much open right

962.699 --> 971.3589999999999
now I think much of their age has passed

966.049 --> 971.3589999999999
and I can tolerate you guys now

976.54 --> 980.61
good and nice sunny day can do

991.02 --> 996.0
my mother always used to be very very

993.63 --> 1000.2
terribly influenced by the weather as

996.0 --> 1002.839
well it was windy she was so Restless

1000.2 --> 1005.2900000000001
just drove her nuts and everybody else

1002.839 --> 1005.2900000000001
drove from

1006.85 --> 1013.45
if it was like really

1010.21 --> 1018.82
raining a man's nuts not storming with

1013.45 --> 1021.1
raining she would get kind of depressed

1018.82 --> 1023.0500000000001
but she couldn't control that very well

1021.1 --> 1024.82
because she wasn't restless but if it

1023.05 --> 1026.9199999999998
was storming then it was a delight and

1024.82 --> 1028.33
it is delight for me like when there's

1026.92 --> 1031.63
like being storms and everything it's

1028.33 --> 1033.49
exhilarating get a little nervous but

1031.63 --> 1035.7700000000002
you also get excited my mother had that

1033.49 --> 1041.98
a lot and when it's sunny it's just

1035.77 --> 1044.8899999999999
glorious nice especially in the winter

1041.98 --> 1048.54
and when there's no wind but it's clear

1044.89 --> 1048.5400000000002
and sunny and bright that's

1049.57 --> 1052.769
it's a good feeling

1062.29 --> 1067.11
no AGM my mom is not a Native American

1068.83 --> 1075.4499999999998
and that she was one of those whites and

1072.28 --> 1075.45
Native Americans

1075.81 --> 1087.7
beautiful blonde woman no that's just so

1082.36 --> 1089.1699999999998
silly to think about yeah you guys

1087.7 --> 1090.79
probably some of you at least will know

1089.17 --> 1095.41
what I'm talking about Martin Lydia's

1090.79 --> 1101.67
hangout yesterday the strange tribe the

1095.41 --> 1105.25
non Redskins tribes off to the white

1101.67 --> 1115.21
Hill gray skinned almost Native

1105.25 --> 1118.48
Americans nobody has ever heard of I

1115.21 --> 1123.49
don't know look you know I've had my own

1118.48 --> 1127.24
angles on this like from a belief angle

1123.49 --> 1129.43
maybe and maybe it's a bit Germanic or

1127.24 --> 1132.76
something I thought like okay maybe my

1129.43 --> 1136.1200000000001
mom is from the northern lands maybe she

1132.76 --> 1138.43
is like an elf really or somehow I don't

1136.12 --> 1140.56
know how that would have worked you know

1138.43 --> 1143.1100000000001
you can go in all directions from kind

1140.56 --> 1144.9099999999999
of a fairy tale physical story like oh

1143.11 --> 1147.6999999999998
it's a group and they just planted a

1144.91 --> 1149.47
couple of people or its remnants so many

1147.7 --> 1151.47
ways of approaching but I've always felt

1149.47 --> 1156.84
that my mother was very special

1151.47 --> 1156.84
so everyone did

1157.66 --> 1164.88
and as she kind of did look very much

1162.49 --> 1164.88
like

1166.299 --> 1170.769
irradiating young blonde

1171.29 --> 1179.12
woman that was like really artistic and

1174.86 --> 1185.9499999999998
expressive and open and great with music

1179.12 --> 1191.1689999999999
a master of music so does fit like the

1185.95 --> 1193.549
the Tolkien elven cultural requirements

1191.169 --> 1199.73
basically for being an elf could have

1193.549 --> 1202.76
been though yeah not as reserved I guess

1199.73 --> 1211.16
is most elves in Lord of the Rings it's

1202.76 --> 1211.549
more open more frolic II alright yeah

1211.16 --> 1213.89
let me

1211.549 --> 1216.8899999999999
I always forget this but I have to turn

1213.89 --> 1219.98
this volume up in the Hangout and that

1216.89 --> 1223.39
apparently helps the volume you guys get

1219.98 --> 1232.429
to hear so I hope that's a little better

1223.39 --> 1234.5300000000002
try to stay close to my mic but yeah

1232.429 --> 1237.549
that hangout was weird that weird

1234.53 --> 1237.549
thought people

1238.63 --> 1244.8090000000002
just thinking about it like okay well

1242.08 --> 1247.72
what kind of people were they where did

1244.809 --> 1251.02
they come from originally and what they

1247.72 --> 1253.72
have been they're remnants of or maybe

1251.02 --> 1258.97
even like the last remaining remnants of

1253.72 --> 1261.63
the territory uns what happened to the

1258.97 --> 1261.63
tight Aryans

1263.01 --> 1270.419
because it is so bizarre to see that

1267.29 --> 1274.1599999999999
this group this group of white people

1270.419 --> 1277.71
that is just weird and out of place not

1274.16 --> 1281.3600000000001
don't feel European at all really or

1277.71 --> 1285.1200000000001
spread up around the world in America

1281.36 --> 1286.62
Africa who knows where else we might

1285.12 --> 1288.11
have smart nicked his crow that's

1286.62 --> 1290.1
probably gonna roll out even more

1288.11 --> 1292.1399999999999
locations where they were spotted

1290.1 --> 1295.37
probably South Amer they probably were

1292.14 --> 1299.22
everywhere you know who knows anyway

1295.37 --> 1305.52
what were they and what happened to them

1299.22 --> 1312.3500000000001
why did they become barbaric you could

1305.52 --> 1312.35
say or what would drive

1312.57 --> 1323.01
that people to become like that for me

1319.94 --> 1324.81
from a non mandala affect perspective

1323.01 --> 1327.33
because you have until a fact can make

1324.81 --> 1329.46
that I already gave an explanation like

1327.33 --> 1332.6399999999999
what could do that but let's assume

1329.46 --> 1334.83
that's not the case what could change a

1332.64 --> 1338.1000000000001
people over the course of time to do

1334.83 --> 1342.1499999999999
that now I've heard big overarching

1338.1 --> 1345.54
philosophies about this before the the

1342.15 --> 1349.0800000000002
cycle of Empires where an empire has its

1345.54 --> 1352.74
peak and then it's golden age and then

1349.08 --> 1360.1499999999999
it starts to degrade in resort into

1352.74 --> 1364.53
barbarism but how ok seems logical the

1360.15 --> 1367.1100000000001
cyclical nature but how why what

1364.53 --> 1371.6399999999999
actually happens in that downward cycle

1367.11 --> 1374.37
to cause that and what happens in the

1371.64 --> 1379.44
spirit of the people that are part of

1374.37 --> 1385.8799999999999
that to go there and not step back not

1379.44 --> 1389.3600000000001
want it back what happens what is that

1385.88 --> 1391.429
I'm very curious to find out and yeah

1389.36 --> 1394.9099999999999
the parallels are they're kind of like

1391.429 --> 1398.75
the social justice warrior madness seems

1394.91 --> 1403.0900000000001
very similar seems like a resort to

1398.75 --> 1406.82
insane barbarism in a way to overdo and

1403.09 --> 1410.51
overdo an untempered naturalist approach

1406.82 --> 1417.58
and just let make it become animal that

1410.51 --> 1417.58
is barbarism really so what causes that

1422.74 --> 1428.32
well in this age to see where it starts

1426.85 --> 1430.84
with the Marxism everything you can

1428.32 --> 1434.3799999999999
basically point back and how what

1430.84 --> 1437.08
engineered that but with the turret

1434.38 --> 1439.3600000000001
areas yeah we know very little about

1437.08 --> 1444.6299999999999
actually what went on in their culture

1439.36 --> 1447.9399999999998
what they were doing over there Imperial

1444.63 --> 1450.669
history because it's all been removed we

1447.94 --> 1452.3400000000001
were only finding traces of it really so

1450.669 --> 1454.72
what were they like

1452.34 --> 1459.279
what were they dealing with were they've

1454.72 --> 1462.07
almost exactly like we were but with

1459.279 --> 1465.73
slightly different technology were

1462.07 --> 1468.99
similar settings happening with the same

1465.73 --> 1471.789
kind of controller schemes and just

1468.99 --> 1476.38
destroying that people is that what

1471.789 --> 1478.69
happened to them I wonder sometimes it's

1476.38 --> 1481.47
kind of fits the history repeating

1478.69 --> 1481.47
itself you know

1490.47 --> 1492.71
right

1500.43 --> 1506.6100000000001
yeah barbarians he said it's a mouse key

1504.51 --> 1511.94
you think barbarians would have better

1506.61 --> 1515.1499999999999
hair dirt well that's the cavemen

1511.94 --> 1518.81
barbarians I think that the caveman

1515.15 --> 1522.74
barbarians are a pure fiction creation

1518.81 --> 1528.1399999999999
coinciding with the evolution delusion I

1522.74 --> 1531.96
don't think that ever existed as a state

1528.14 --> 1534.99
but there may have been people let's

1531.96 --> 1536.7
just call them dwarves or whatever that

1534.99 --> 1539.1200000000001
would have been like that very hairy

1536.7 --> 1542.82
people and hey there are still some

1539.12 --> 1545.6999999999998
races around the world that oh they grow

1542.82 --> 1551.37
freakin huge beer it's naturally very

1545.7 --> 1556.5
quickly so but no I don't think that

1551.37 --> 1559.25
being hairy makes you barbarian so that

1556.5 --> 1562.39
has nothing to do

1559.25 --> 1562.39
[Music]

1563.58 --> 1569.369
but barbarism seems to as I think about

1567.48 --> 1572.85
it you know as I think about the whole

1569.369 --> 1574.769
fake history concept the idea that there

1572.85 --> 1577.86
was nothing and it all started with

1574.769 --> 1580.169
those retards the cavemen and then it is

1577.86 --> 1582.539
this and they got government and

1580.169 --> 1584.3690000000001
organized structures and then they went

1582.539 --> 1588.4089999999999
into a medieval period and everyone

1584.369 --> 1591.299
became [ __ ] and religious and

1588.409 --> 1592.8600000000001
deluded and their enlightenment and then

1591.299 --> 1594.149
it grew bigger I don't think that any of

1592.86 --> 1596.6689999999999
that went like that it's very

1594.149 --> 1599.149
conveniently linear and it's absolutely

1596.669 --> 1603.0900000000001
unrealistic I think it it's always

1599.149 --> 1610.139
cyclical everything is like a sinus wave

1603.09 --> 1617.009
of energy and I think that barbarism is

1610.139 --> 1621.9299999999998
just part of every yeah humanoid or

1617.009 --> 1624.1200000000001
maybe even animal cycle

1621.93 --> 1630.54
imagine it like this there could be some

1624.12 --> 1633.6
kind of herd animals and they would act

1630.54 --> 1636.23
normal and then in a certain period they

1633.6 --> 1640.1399999999999
would start to become more aggressive

1636.23 --> 1642.51
very aggressive and actually start

1640.14 --> 1645.21
destroying other species around them or

1642.51 --> 1647.1299999999999
destroying the forest or whatever and

1645.21 --> 1650.55
nobody knows what the hell's going on

1647.13 --> 1653.13
and they seem like becoming demonic or

1650.55 --> 1654.45
whatever and well they might be

1653.13 --> 1657.48
destroyed because of this you know

1654.45 --> 1659.57
humans interference or they may

1657.48 --> 1662.79
accidentally write themselves out or

1659.57 --> 1667.559
they return back to normal again and

1662.79 --> 1669.84
it's like oh right nothing ever happened

1667.559 --> 1672.809
they're just normal now again it could

1669.84 --> 1675.48
take a while before but maybe everything

1672.809 --> 1678.99
goes through this weird barbaric cycle

1675.48 --> 1681.3600000000001
maybe the barbaric nature is like an

1678.99 --> 1684.929
electromagnetic side effect of the

1681.36 --> 1688.2299999999998
energies that we are a part of that we

1684.929 --> 1691.2
lend to shape our spirits on this throne

1688.23 --> 1694.02
of flesh so maybe it is barbarism is a

1691.2 --> 1699.23
natural side-effect of the cycle of the

1694.02 --> 1699.23
energies that help us manifest

1701.22 --> 1708.609
it's like he philosophical but yeah

1705.19 --> 1711.039
think about it because just barbarians

1708.609 --> 1715.359
for a barbarians sake or this starting

1711.039 --> 1719.919
position no I think that any people

1715.359 --> 1722.889
could have amazing peak civilization

1719.919 --> 1729.5700000000002
wisdoms and every people can have

1722.889 --> 1729.57
absolute barbaric phases

1730.059 --> 1738.149
and however they manifest it is cyclical

1733.929 --> 1742.0590000000002
and I think it's in everything it's just

1738.149 --> 1747.2099999999998
the default state caused by the energies

1742.059 --> 1747.21
that help us manifest our spirit

1768.53 --> 1771.16
what

1780.71 --> 1788.32
yeah the big question from all

1784.34 --> 1792.789
directions how do you make peace well

1788.32 --> 1796.6
you can make peace by forcing the other

1792.789 --> 1796.6
to become like you

1799.0 --> 1804.49
you can only do it by making them

1801.94 --> 1808.96
understand from their perspective the

1804.49 --> 1812.65
necessity to adapt to you as they show

1808.96 --> 1814.8600000000001
you the necessity for you to adapt to

1812.65 --> 1814.8600000000001
them

1820.19 --> 1829.01
to minimize damage

1823.98 --> 1829.01
that's the true nature of peace

1834.12 --> 1845.87
so it's up to everyone everyone that has

1841.559 --> 1848.25
these controls make the decisions that

1845.87 --> 1850.77
steer the directions through these

1848.25 --> 1855.72
moments and then it's in everyone that

1850.77 --> 1862.37
has that power to change that to see see

1855.72 --> 1865.91
how to do this and see further just

1862.37 --> 1869.03
I'd almost like to say approach the

1865.91 --> 1872.41
others even the opponents from the back

1869.03 --> 1877.76
through God through the creation itself

1872.41 --> 1880.75
connect connects there where there is

1877.76 --> 1880.75
connection

1888.2 --> 1895.1000000000001
and give that priority give that the

1892.91 --> 1899.5400000000002
connection give them priority in growth

1895.1 --> 1901.36
and work the other things out keep it to

1899.54 --> 1904.1
yourself

1901.36 --> 1906.28
doesn't that make sense that's even how

1904.1 --> 1911.23
I thought originally like about the

1906.28 --> 1914.03
Arabian cultures very harsh problems

1911.23 --> 1916.79
you're in there you could say this is

1914.03 --> 1918.59
still from like a 90s leftist leftist

1916.79 --> 1921.52
perspective okay

1918.59 --> 1925.2099999999998
I always thought like yeah no you just

1921.52 --> 1929.26
you know they do it their way it is

1925.21 --> 1933.5
disgusting to us to any civilized person

1929.26 --> 1935.66
sorry but and we got rid of that but

1933.5 --> 1937.46
yeah you can just destroy them because

1935.66 --> 1940.4
of that or something do you have to just

1937.46 --> 1945.6200000000001
let them figure it out and help them

1940.4 --> 1948.5900000000001
figure it out how to move on how to

1945.62 --> 1955.6699999999998
slowly change things you know that's the

1948.59 --> 1957.7099999999998
real left is way not not so oh they want

1955.67 --> 1960.1100000000001
adapt okay then we're gonna adapt to

1957.71 --> 1963.97
them irrationally we're gonna take on

1960.11 --> 1968.2099999999998
their madness and accept that that is

1963.97 --> 1971.81
total insanity that is Marxist insanity

1968.21 --> 1975.41
needs to leave let's not get too deeply

1971.81 --> 1978.09
into that so yeah

1975.41 --> 1980.99
all right yeah smash is super chat but

1978.09 --> 1987.08
unfortunately it doesn't work yet I

1980.99 --> 1987.08
think maybe tomorrow

1991.24 --> 1997.33
I did see that movie I did see it but I

1994.87 --> 1999.789
didn't see really a Blood Moon it was

1997.33 --> 2003.36
just a big freaking moon staring at me

1999.789 --> 2005.39
in the night keeping me up until 3

2003.36 --> 2005.3899999999999
o'clock

2029.69 --> 2034.51
so

2031.94 --> 2034.51
yes

2037.01 --> 2043.1299999999999
Hagrid wells yesterday that guy is

2039.5 --> 2047.45
really interesting I didn't even know he

2043.13 --> 2051.05
had such that we had we had such

2047.45 --> 2052.849
resonance concerning nature I pretty

2051.05 --> 2059.7200000000003
much figured that out during the Hangout

2052.849 --> 2062.389
I had no idea I just know don't kick me

2059.72 --> 2064.0099999999998
I'm here yeah I gonna walk the dogs and

2062.389 --> 2064.73
I'll be back in like maybe five minutes

2064.01 --> 2067.159
all right

2064.73 --> 2070.01
what so I gonna meet myself and I gonna

2067.159 --> 2072.5
walk my doggies I just wanted to save

2070.01 --> 2073.8790000000004
save this part so let me walk my doggies

2072.5 --> 2075.619
and I'll turn off my camera I'm a

2073.879 --> 2078.79
microphone and I jump in in a few

2075.619 --> 2078.79
minutes right all right

2096.64 --> 2103.98
and um something weird google it

2110.59 --> 2115.5
rides yeah

2116.56 --> 2126.57
a vesica Pisces and that yeah you could

2123.67 --> 2126.57
call it a con

2129.05 --> 2136.0
a controlled false paradigm

2132.5 --> 2136.0
two choices that

2136.14 --> 2140.72
that both don't work and keep you

2138.269 --> 2145.0099999999998
trapped between them

2140.72 --> 2147.7599999999998
hmm yep that's definitely a one of the

2145.01 --> 2147.76
darker tricks

2154.16 --> 2164.16
Chris Mary look Satan is a force it is

2160.47 --> 2167.8399999999997
in essence this the essence of lies and

2164.16 --> 2171.1499999999996
it is the force within the ego that

2167.84 --> 2174.8
oversimplifies that lies that lies about

2171.15 --> 2179.4
the very nature your being to yourself

2174.8 --> 2184.02
is a force not a physics force but

2179.4 --> 2186.48
spiritual force Oh to personify it into

2184.02 --> 2188.28
an entity no I don't think Satan it

2186.48 --> 2193.83
really is an entity I think it is just

2188.28 --> 2198.3500000000004
an energy of force off as part of the

2193.83 --> 2198.35
complete interdimensional creation

2210.74 --> 2219.54
well I think that Christ

2213.41 --> 2222.6
force Christ that spirit then is assumed

2219.54 --> 2224.64
to have been a man it's not even

2222.6 --> 2228.89
relevant really but that spirit that

2224.64 --> 2228.89
energy that is the opposing force

2231.42 --> 2237.56
and is also part of creation and it is

2234.74 --> 2240.1299999999997
creation

2237.56 --> 2240.13
so

2243.45 --> 2246.1099999999997
yeah

2249.65 --> 2254.119
I got I got four she wants to work

2252.259 --> 2257.509
they've been all night all night long

2254.119 --> 2260.029
alone home so I had to clean some some

2257.509 --> 2262.339
poop around the house damn it and now

2260.029 --> 2263.9
I'm working him as for the first

2262.339 --> 2267.4
official work of the day

2263.9 --> 2267.4
Robbie being in a few minutes

2273.2 --> 2276.0989999999997
and you guys

2284.33 --> 2288.77
I can kind of chime in on and off

2286.55 --> 2290.03
because I need the two hands you know

2288.77 --> 2293.93
and I want to make too much background

2290.03 --> 2298.0400000000004
noise I came in because I wanted me we

2293.93 --> 2300.2599999999998
have to make our wing great again as

2298.04 --> 2315.56
Nino's set out to an inny of the

2300.26 --> 2318.7900000000004
tropical system we don't have time for

2315.56 --> 2320.06
the meeting with the floatover society

2318.79 --> 2322.1
yep

2320.06 --> 2324.0499999999997
well the flutter society is kind of a

2322.1 --> 2326.24
waste of time we don't need them anymore

2324.05 --> 2329.2400000000002
it's an archaic principle we're just

2326.24 --> 2333.2599999999998
people connecting on the internet now

2329.24 --> 2335.54
it's much better it's no monolithic

2333.26 --> 2337.73
structure trying to keep us in a certain

2335.54 --> 2341.15
kind of line we can figure it out our

2337.73 --> 2343.79
own ways and then bump into each other

2341.15 --> 2346.1600000000003
and see how much the others found that

2343.79 --> 2351.08
makes sense to us and then we assimilate

2346.16 --> 2353.66
that from each other what people beam so

2351.08 --> 2355.16
what people been so hating through me in

2353.66 --> 2358.0699999999997
these last couple days I understand

2355.16 --> 2360.3199999999997
their point of view but this is a solid

2358.07 --> 2362.42
like horrible - horrible we didn't find

2360.32 --> 2365.3300000000004
a medium orient where we can you know

2362.42 --> 2369.83
find shorter piece but what is this

2365.33 --> 2374.15
stuff meant the consequences of your

2369.83 --> 2379.72
actions do that's what happens you know

2374.15 --> 2379.7200000000003
people get nasty because you hurt them

2380.54 --> 2387.65
I always I always I have always believed

2384.71 --> 2389.69
in the attack they attack the argument

2387.65 --> 2391.7000000000003
and not the character and everything

2389.69 --> 2393.89
around that analogy neighborhood you

2391.7 --> 2396.89
know like I don't I don't I don't

2393.89 --> 2398.99
appreciate the attacking on a persona

2396.89 --> 2401.33
because of a different point of view

2398.99 --> 2403.6099999999997
it's just my take on it yeah but it's

2401.33 --> 2406.31
not about the argument it is about the

2403.61 --> 2409.34
persona it is about the acts this is not

2406.31 --> 2412.37
about flat earth or globe earth it's

2409.34 --> 2417.17
about how you portrayed yourself to be

2412.37 --> 2422.0299999999997
among us how you acted like something

2417.17 --> 2424.34
you were not and you abuse our trust so

2422.03 --> 2426.8900000000003
this is about the character Jose this is

2424.34 --> 2429.4100000000003
not about the argument it's about the

2426.89 --> 2430.7599999999998
character that's exactly the points at

2429.41 --> 2433.0899999999997
the point that you don't seem to be

2430.76 --> 2433.09
getting

2435.58 --> 2441.2799999999997
then you see it a little bit like a

2437.53 --> 2443.53
little bit of a cold tea behavior in

2441.28 --> 2455.76
some way I got it I gonna set up the

2443.53 --> 2459.1600000000003
other dogs while do you speak coltish no

2455.76 --> 2461.38
it's personal it's not about the subject

2459.16 --> 2463.45
it's not about the arguments not about

2461.38 --> 2466.09
flat earth globe earth it is about the

2463.45 --> 2468.8199999999997
character it's about what you did among

2466.09 --> 2471.46
people there's more than just the

2468.82 --> 2474.73
position of your argument there is also

2471.46 --> 2479.14
the social aspect of the people that you

2474.73 --> 2483.07
deal with okay and if you do certain

2479.14 --> 2484.99
things yeah that's gonna have

2483.07 --> 2487.0
consequences and that's what you're

2484.99 --> 2490.3199999999997
feeling this is not about you going to

2487.0 --> 2495.32
the globe this is about what you've done

2490.32 --> 2499.67
to get back there thank you

2495.32 --> 2500.15
but you let happen that's what it's

2499.67 --> 2502.64
about

2500.15 --> 2505.84
and if you don't see that then you got a

2502.64 --> 2512.12
problem you got a serious problem dude

2505.84 --> 2515.09
it's nothing more to say hmm I don't see

2512.12 --> 2516.38
it bro for real and I promise I love

2515.09 --> 2518.1800000000003
because something is my style and you

2516.38 --> 2520.9100000000003
know I giggle a lot a little bit like

2518.18 --> 2522.71
chocolate I identify with him a lot we

2520.91 --> 2526.0099999999998
like ha ha say something serious and we

2522.71 --> 2527.45
laugh but I'm not I'm not trolling I'm

2526.01 --> 2533.9900000000002
not having fun and all this [ __ ] you

2527.45 --> 2536.5099999999998
know ah I don't see it because I maybe

2533.99 --> 2539.6
took the wrong approach I did it in a

2536.51 --> 2543.13
way that it wasn't supposed to be this

2539.6 --> 2546.41
way for some people but I don't see it

2543.13 --> 2551.75
whatever I did and the way I did it for

2546.41 --> 2557.12
me to be insulted in a personal way the

2551.75 --> 2559.94
way he is to being happening if you join

2557.12 --> 2561.2599999999998
us you know you have been part of the

2559.94 --> 2564.71
panel you've been through all these

2561.26 --> 2567.7400000000002
questions and all that and if you just

2564.71 --> 2571.4
go along with that dishonestly

2567.74 --> 2574.0699999999997
because turns out that after a long

2571.4 --> 2577.73
while now now you flipped and suddenly

2574.07 --> 2579.31
you say no you suddenly basically admit

2577.73 --> 2582.16
that you don't understand these things

2579.31 --> 2586.91
well that means you lied about it

2582.16 --> 2591.0099999999998
you lied not just once persistently as

2586.91 --> 2591.0099999999998
an agenda to hide it

2591.499 --> 2598.499
it's us for understanding I don't

2594.839 --> 2600.5389999999998
understand many points on it what hold

2598.499 --> 2603.9889999999996
the both sides you know I know I know

2600.539 --> 2607.38
but you acted like you did because

2603.989 --> 2610.169
otherwise we've we would have won the

2607.38 --> 2614.579
debates my god yeah you would have been

2610.169 --> 2616.439
grilled and you know this so you act oh

2614.579 --> 2623.279
it's okay I have more listening to it

2616.439 --> 2626.969
acted dishonestly no I did not I don't

2623.279 --> 2630.059
understand but you acted like you did to

2626.969 --> 2632.13
evade fire for a very long time not just

2630.059 --> 2638.8190000000004
once when you couldn't handle it but you

2632.13 --> 2641.1890000000003
just completely put a mask over you to

2638.819 --> 2645.719
cover up something that is kind of

2641.189 --> 2647.819
important that's coming about this for

2645.719 --> 2651.63
one second you're making an accusation

2647.819 --> 2653.969
that is it was a [ __ ] I forgot and you

2651.63 --> 2654.839
just say it was an act right you say

2653.969 --> 2656.819
something like that

2654.839 --> 2660.179
I don't know what you just say I don't

2656.819 --> 2663.63
want to paraphrase you okay so you

2660.179 --> 2665.039
making a claim and an accusation and you

2663.63 --> 2668.429
don't know you don't know what's going

2665.039 --> 2670.469
on in my mind how when you know without

2668.429 --> 2673.079
exactly what's going you've been able to

2670.469 --> 2675.059
back it up yeah I do know what's going

2673.079 --> 2677.4590000000003
on in your mind because you proved it

2675.059 --> 2681.029
exactly what's going on in your mind and

2677.459 --> 2683.989
not everybody may get that I do I do get

2681.029 --> 2683.989
people okay

2685.8 --> 2691.23
and I know what you want I know what you

2688.05 --> 2694.4700000000003
want what areas you like to stick to you

2691.23 --> 2697.02
like to be nice like to be warm and

2694.47 --> 2699.3599999999997
everything is okay right but there's a

2697.02 --> 2703.44
certain part that you just so don't seem

2699.36 --> 2710.31
to get and that's that honesty is very

2703.44 --> 2713.43
important just an axe you know you could

2710.31 --> 2715.71
be a freakin American politician as all

2713.43 --> 2718.08
look at the horse a nice of such nice

2715.71 --> 2719.52
dogs a lovely family oh he's so normal

2718.08 --> 2724.2
but at the meantime yeah he lies about

2719.52 --> 2726.33
[ __ ] okay that now just look through

2724.2 --> 2729.77
those glasses then suddenly all that

2726.33 --> 2737.34
niceness becomes really disgusting

2729.77 --> 2739.62
becomes a market to try not to make the

2737.34 --> 2741.51
line look as bad it becomes disgusting

2739.62 --> 2744.12
just saying from that perspective

2741.51 --> 2746.76
yeah it's okay and I appreciate that is

2744.12 --> 2748.5299999999997
your personal opinion and you're taking

2746.76 --> 2752.25
all of this because you are like first

2748.53 --> 2755.3100000000004
person involved in all this [ __ ] also I

2752.25 --> 2759.18
appreciate that but some people is gonna

2755.31 --> 2762.81
take your word as for this is it as many

2759.18 --> 2764.64
other things and that's what I see I

2762.81 --> 2767.4
don't I don't appreciate that

2764.64 --> 2768.96
I mean you can I know is people know

2767.4 --> 2773.04
this much than that they know it's your

2768.96 --> 2778.71
opinion no no I appreciate your opinion

2773.04 --> 2781.8
for your video sorry I'm gonna speak it

2778.71 --> 2784.98
exactly how I see it you can disagree

2781.8 --> 2787.9500000000003
with that oh you like if you do then

2784.98 --> 2790.08
argue it and actually no no if it's just

2787.95 --> 2792.4199999999996
your video you don't get it well that's

2790.08 --> 2795.27
your problem if you don't get it your

2792.42 --> 2797.52
entire look engage it and then you can't

2795.27 --> 2801.0
make me stop doing it to make me stop

2797.52 --> 2802.71
doing it you have to get it okay you

2801.0 --> 2805.53
have to understand why I'm doing this

2802.71 --> 2808.28
and as I'm explaining it and I am

2805.53 --> 2808.28
explaining it

2808.599 --> 2820.509
just do it sorry I'm almost done let me

2816.739 --> 2820.509
on Unchained adults

2845.079 --> 2852.0190000000002
hallelujah I'm done so do you think that

2849.249 --> 2855.259
many of the growth the boilers and the

2852.019 --> 2857.8689999999997
flat earthers are terrific observations

2855.259 --> 2861.43
or do you in your opinion issue of the

2857.869 --> 2861.4300000000003
boilers cherry-picking observations

2870.549 --> 2877.549
clear distinct pattern emerging from all

2874.099 --> 2878.7200000000003
sides and that is one group goes here

2877.549 --> 2882.619
and no further

2878.72 --> 2885.98
and the other group goes and goes and

2882.619 --> 2888.819
goes and more and more and deeper and it

2885.98 --> 2892.63
all fits and that's where you can't look

2888.819 --> 2895.5389999999998
you can't see it you just don't get it

2892.63 --> 2898.13
but do you think that the boilers if

2895.539 --> 2900.98
somebody that really want to go out and

2898.13 --> 2904.279
record a lot of food is you think maybe

2900.98 --> 2907.099
they have withheld foolish or because of

2904.279 --> 2908.72
not presenting it for X or Y reason do

2907.099 --> 2913.039
you think some of them are really sherry

2908.72 --> 2918.41
pickers just just the boilers what are

2913.039 --> 2922.21
what do you think the you thing any of

2918.41 --> 2926.18
the boilers are holding back

2922.21 --> 2928.2490000000003
observations they have made maybe can be

2926.18 --> 2929.799
interpreted really good as a flattered

2928.249 --> 2934.029
proof do you think they hold

2929.799 --> 2936.68
observations back and not present them I

2934.029 --> 2938.96
don't know I think they might actually

2936.68 --> 2942.5789999999997
instantly delete it at the moment of

2938.96 --> 2948.349
realization maybe even subconsciously

2942.579 --> 2949.549
because it hurts I don't know maybe they

2948.349 --> 2953.15
do maybe they don't

2949.549 --> 2956.569
yeah true yeah I love all fluttered do

2953.15 --> 2959.319
you think a fluttered will do the same

2956.569 --> 2964.519
do observations done and withheld

2959.319 --> 2967.549
apparently not oh well maybe some of the

2964.519 --> 2969.16
lower tier ones that are just fooling

2967.549 --> 2972.68
around

2969.16 --> 2977.5699999999997
maybe that them but the the guys that I

2972.68 --> 2980.0899999999997
know no absolutely not no we drive be

2977.57 --> 2983.0
thrilled by the challenge by something

2980.09 --> 2985.13
that we can explain with our current

2983.0 --> 2988.93
knowledge it's more challenge more to

2985.13 --> 2995.06
build with so yeah we take everything

2988.93 --> 2998.39
you can run t is lowered here sorry do

2995.06 --> 3003.13
you think run T is lower tier person

2998.39 --> 3005.5
that holds observations because his he's

3003.13 --> 3007.6600000000003
presenting now observations he hath made

3005.5 --> 3009.4
for months and months on he was holding

3007.66 --> 3012.0099999999998
it back because he wasn't able to

3009.4 --> 3014.85
explain it and that's why I ask

3012.01 --> 3017.86
well he's showing it now isn't it

3014.85 --> 3020.5299999999997
exactly so he was holding observations

3017.86 --> 3023.8900000000003
he didn't want a percent no he needed to

3020.53 --> 3026.53
think about it look I have huge things

3023.89 --> 3028.48
in my mind okay that I've been having

3026.53 --> 3030.73
there since the start that I'm not

3028.48 --> 3033.01
throwing out there because I don't know

3030.73 --> 3035.23
how to deal with it you know if ranty

3033.01 --> 3037.75
doesn't know how what he's looking at if

3035.23 --> 3040.96
he has no conceptual sexualisation how

3037.75 --> 3044.89
can you blame him for putting it out not

3040.96 --> 3047.05
putting it out there yet I held I held

3044.89 --> 3053.8599999999997
back so many observations because

3047.05 --> 3055.8700000000003
there's a boom in shame well okay I deal

3053.86 --> 3058.75
in a bunch I deleted a bunch but I still

3055.87 --> 3060.52
got a lot of good stuff because it was

3058.75 --> 3062.56
socially clear days and I say I'm not

3060.52 --> 3064.39
going to delete this maybe one day I

3062.56 --> 3067.21
gonna review it and see what I find

3064.39 --> 3069.97
again but I put it I tagged it I say I

3067.21 --> 3072.19
say ball proof and I put in a little

3069.97 --> 3077.04
ziplock ball prove I got like four SD

3072.19 --> 3077.04
cards in that bag there from month ago

3078.3 --> 3086.5600000000004
right look Randy has a different angle

3083.62 --> 3088.79
to doing what he does than you you

3086.56 --> 3092.72
apparently just like to screw around

3088.79 --> 3095.63
and grab be interesting and nice and get

3092.72 --> 3098.6
attention and just fooled around that's

3095.63 --> 3102.88
your thing you're good at it okay not

3098.6 --> 3106.5499999999997
really yeah you do yeah

3102.88 --> 3109.4900000000002
that's just your style ranty he takes

3106.55 --> 3113.3
Flat Earth very seriously and he wants

3109.49 --> 3118.04
to get rid of the ball lies where they

3113.3 --> 3120.29
obviously are and so yeah he is a little

3118.04 --> 3123.32
bit more agenda driven in that so yeah

3120.29 --> 3126.05
he's not gonna be made to look a fool by

3123.32 --> 3128.03
not being able to know what to say about

3126.05 --> 3130.07
something so that makes perfect sense

3128.03 --> 3134.03
that he does that okay

3130.07 --> 3137.51
and you well if you help things back I

3134.03 --> 3140.4500000000003
don't know why you would do it I don't

3137.51 --> 3145.15
know but yeah you seem to be perfectly

3140.45 --> 3147.5
fine for a few days just shown stuff

3145.15 --> 3151.73
amazing footage by the way it still is

3147.5 --> 3154.28
no matter how you see it proving certain

3151.73 --> 3156.62
things and saying like oh yeah that this

3154.28 --> 3159.2900000000004
doesn't make any sense with that how

3156.62 --> 3161.33
bendy train tracks versus soundly you

3159.29 --> 3164.21
know yeah that was quite in everyone's

3161.33 --> 3166.67
face and yeah if you don't switch

3164.21 --> 3171.44
afterward it just doesn't make any sense

3166.67 --> 3175.13
it is psychotic it comes to a psychotic

3171.44 --> 3176.9900000000002
when you do that do you think I wasn't I

3175.13 --> 3178.58
was never serious about this do you

3176.99 --> 3185.3599999999997
think I never took this subject

3178.58 --> 3188.75
seriously really you think that oh if

3185.36 --> 3192.8
you know that's that's a red herring I

3188.75 --> 3196.22
just told you okay but you forgot what

3192.8 --> 3200.9
you were so really no words I just said

3196.22 --> 3203.56
if you were serious then it's psychotic

3200.9 --> 3205.73
what you've done

3203.56 --> 3207.14
doesn't make any freaking sense no I

3205.73 --> 3208.31
really will know how to change your

3207.14 --> 3209.7799999999997
state of mind

3208.31 --> 3212.15
you weren't serious if you're just

3209.78 --> 3214.67
getting around yeah so just a nice troll

3212.15 --> 3215.859
joke and you just played with everyone's

3214.67 --> 3219.339
mind and feeling

3215.859 --> 3220.93
yeah you get hatred for that terrible

3219.339 --> 3223.39
opinion that's your opinion not truth

3220.93 --> 3230.7
but yeah you I appreciate your opinion

3223.39 --> 3234.19
oh that's the two options either you

3230.7 --> 3235.8089999999997
display total psychosis or you were

3234.19 --> 3238.869
[ __ ] around with everyone all the

3235.809 --> 3239.9990000000003
time there's if you can point at another

3238.869 --> 3242.4700000000003
direction

3239.999 --> 3247.3289999999997
another option I'd like to hear it

3242.47 --> 3249.7
mm-hmm Joanie's I took this I took this

3247.329 --> 3252.279
very seriously and I spent a lot of time

3249.7 --> 3256.5989999999997
I lost a lot of dream and I put a lot of

3252.279 --> 3261.099
effort time and sweat onto this research

3256.599 --> 3263.829
I lost many nights and I lost I lost

3261.099 --> 3266.559
many things in my personal life because

3263.829 --> 3271.42
of this I was so involved into this bro

3266.559 --> 3273.009
a lot until I say I need to I need to

3271.42 --> 3274.9300000000003
step back and look from a different

3273.009 --> 3277.059
point of view let's see what I what I

3274.93 --> 3280.8089999999997
get now and then the first thing that

3277.059 --> 3283.539
came to mind si II I mean is in my face

3280.809 --> 3285.46
for a few months since I got the P 900

3283.539 --> 3287.619
the food is that I've been holding and I

3285.46 --> 3290.4990000000003
said why am i holding this where I why

3287.619 --> 3294.6400000000003
am I being disingenuous in not

3290.499 --> 3296.769
presenting this as an evidence so I was

3294.64 --> 3299.44
very seriously and then I took it more

3296.769 --> 3302.9799999999996
seriously on thankee taking this next

3299.44 --> 3308.2200000000003
step on taking this new stand I am on

3302.98 --> 3311.17
right now I am happy that is weird

3308.22 --> 3314.0789999999997
it's very weird if I would have been you

3311.17 --> 3316.119
I would have put that [ __ ] out even

3314.079 --> 3318.489
though you couldn't explain it and just

3316.119 --> 3320.23
be okay with it and figure it out

3318.489 --> 3321.16
afterwards I'm probably gonna happen

3320.23 --> 3325.329
very quickly

3321.16 --> 3328.269
but yeah you held it back I guess in the

3325.329 --> 3331.9
same type of motivational system as

3328.269 --> 3335.3489999999997
Randy did and I don't mind that if you

3331.9 --> 3338.08
want to hold something back to figure it

3335.349 --> 3341.5
out first but

3338.08 --> 3343.5699999999997
yeah if you're gonna claim for if you're

3341.5 --> 3346.39
gonna basically exclude something to

3343.57 --> 3349.69
withhold evidence in the wider argument

3346.39 --> 3351.8799999999997
like this never happens yep here you go

3349.69 --> 3355.15
you actually did have it then that

3351.88 --> 3357.2200000000003
becomes totally disingenuous but yeah I

3355.15 --> 3359.4100000000003
would never find out that's all sneaky

3357.22 --> 3365.3799999999997
thing about it yeah this is just one

3359.41 --> 3370.29
stinking observation point of view whole

3365.38 --> 3372.82
thing is you've already made the go

3370.29 --> 3376.6
impossible with what you showed you

3372.82 --> 3379.36
showed a freaking curve on the horizon

3376.6 --> 3381.61
and a bunch of train tracks very short

3379.36 --> 3386.1400000000003
distance that makes no sense

3381.61 --> 3389.83
it proves it's not curved it proves it's

3386.14 --> 3392.47
an optical effect happens when you look

3389.83 --> 3394.6
over a flat plane and a low enough

3392.47 --> 3397.0899999999997
altitude is exactly what you prove to

3394.6 --> 3399.7599999999998
everyone with it and it looked exactly

3397.09 --> 3404.05
the same I could at that point like the

3399.76 --> 3407.98
Pontchartrain Bridge so it's there how

3404.05 --> 3409.57
can you not get that and you know with

3407.98 --> 3411.79
that footage how would you even be

3409.57 --> 3413.6800000000003
fearful to show anything else because

3411.79 --> 3416.68
you already got the proof that it can't

3413.68 --> 3418.4199999999996
be curved now it's all just a matter as

3416.68 --> 3419.98
trying to figure out what you're seeing

3418.42 --> 3424.51
with the other footage that you don't

3419.98 --> 3427.86
get that's all I this whole switching

3424.51 --> 3427.86
around you know

3429.17 --> 3434.66
it's psychotic like sorry swishing

3431.869 --> 3436.789
around I just I just switched once this

3434.66 --> 3439.94
time back to the ball pretty much is my

3436.789 --> 3442.2200000000003
only swish bombing first time I switch

3439.94 --> 3445.75
to flutter because I was we were all

3442.22 --> 3448.25
born in a globe pretty much I just

3445.75 --> 3450.769
accepted fluttered and I researched it

3448.25 --> 3452.269
and I in or under studio and it was

3450.769 --> 3456.5589999999997
beautiful ride

3452.269 --> 3459.41
but I was always taking the different

3456.559 --> 3464.529
stunts that I was very active in in

3459.41 --> 3468.0989999999997
every kind of not just a platter I was

3464.529 --> 3472.72
always having an open mind to understand

3468.099 --> 3472.7200000000003
everything and that's the difference

3476.299 --> 3482.069
interaction from every every side is

3479.28 --> 3485.25
what I mean that's very important for

3482.069 --> 3487.14
everybody because those who are just

3485.25 --> 3489.24
hiding know you personally are when I'm

3487.14 --> 3491.91
talking to some people in shadow whoever

3489.24 --> 3497.3089999999997
listens back those people who that only

3491.91 --> 3501.1189999999997
wash flattered content follow their big

3497.309 --> 3505.44
channels mirror other people's evidence

3501.119 --> 3508.94
or flattered and all that stuff if not

3505.44 --> 3508.94
the right thing to do they should also

3509.63 --> 3516.21
know everyone does their own thing they

3513.119 --> 3518.339
do what they can do and you can't expect

3516.21 --> 3520.859
everyone to completely understand

3518.339 --> 3523.109
everything they deal with they go with

3520.859 --> 3525.18
their feeling just as the glowers in

3523.109 --> 3527.5789999999997
their own way go with their feeling and

3525.18 --> 3529.799
not really getting it just knowing all

3527.579 --> 3534.3590000000004
the standard textbook routine [ __ ]

3529.799 --> 3536.4
stuff by heart everything with that hole

3534.359 --> 3538.3489999999997
in their consciousness okay

3536.4 --> 3542.039
they do what they think they're doing so

3538.349 --> 3544.289
you can't tell flat erasers that don't

3542.039 --> 3550.0490000000004
get the full picture you shouldn't be

3544.289 --> 3554.369
doing this those who called me those who

3550.049 --> 3556.38
call me a traitor and you sold out or

3554.369 --> 3558.48
you're doing this for clique saying

3556.38 --> 3560.46
likes and be famous or whatever

3558.48 --> 3563.15
that's [ __ ] those are the people

3560.46 --> 3566.609
that are either slaughtered circle-jerk

3563.15 --> 3568.38
dude everybody does that [ __ ] okay I'm

3566.609 --> 3572.819
surprised you haven't even been called a

3568.38 --> 3576.809
NASA [ __ ] infiltrator yet or something

3572.819 --> 3580.77
okay some some up call me and goes are

3576.809 --> 3582.9
you really look somebody can do anything

3580.77 --> 3585.049
and they will hear anything they've ever

3582.9 --> 3588.089
imagined and beyond as an accusation

3585.049 --> 3590.0389999999998
okay because people overdo that [ __ ]

3588.089 --> 3592.96
these days because they're bored or

3590.039 --> 3597.17
something but

3592.96 --> 3599.39
that's really not relevant that just

3597.17 --> 3602.6800000000003
that happen you do yeah I think that the

3599.39 --> 3607.49
morning that you did this for money okay

3602.68 --> 3610.25
what I'm saying is it's yeah you and I

3607.49 --> 3612.77
said it during that hangout you you

3610.25 --> 3614.84
really did throw your dignity overboard

3612.77 --> 3616.97
for a while and you may need it too

3614.84 --> 3621.11
because you can't handle this weird

3616.97 --> 3624.6699999999996
pressure and you were obsessing over it

3621.11 --> 3627.53
and that's not healthy but to then just

3624.67 --> 3631.73
switch around like that that is just

3627.53 --> 3633.0400000000004
that is just as maniacal as obsessing

3631.73 --> 3637.04
over it okay

3633.04 --> 3641.39
you should have just walked away turn

3637.04 --> 3643.49
off the internet and just enjoy your

3641.39 --> 3645.8599999999997
surroundings for a while that I want to

3643.49 --> 3648.5
be a tiger now you felt like you've made

3645.86 --> 3651.65
things worse for yourself I didn't want

3648.5 --> 3653.63
to be a target than those three or four

3651.65 --> 3656.27
people that disappear Jamie Brown Jimmy

3653.63 --> 3657.6800000000003
Brown was quite for it for a little bit

3656.27 --> 3660.89
and he does a little hangout here and

3657.68 --> 3663.62
there but no I'm in this neighborhood I

3660.89 --> 3665.18
mean he coming here deep bro I want to

3663.62 --> 3666.44
keep doing a survey so I want to figure

3665.18 --> 3669.02
this out I want to keep the interaction

3666.44 --> 3670.94
alive that's what I want I'm not gonna

3669.02 --> 3672.23
just drop my globe and say I believe in

3670.94 --> 3674.66
the globe and walk away

3672.23 --> 3676.88
no I'm interested in this object I want

3674.66 --> 3681.2
to find I want to get to the bottom of

3676.88 --> 3683.3900000000003
this easy that you did that it's insane

3681.2 --> 3687.0499999999997
that you switched like this after

3683.39 --> 3690.56
everything you've even presented it's

3687.05 --> 3693.44
just insane it's nothing wrong with that

3690.56 --> 3695.09
man there's nothing wrong with insane

3693.44 --> 3697.43
are you serious

3695.09 --> 3698.63
we have nothing wrong with with just

3697.43 --> 3701.18
changing like that

3698.63 --> 3705.23
I'm staying no it is it is because you

3701.18 --> 3709.04
just literally presented really good

3705.23 --> 3713.18
proof against the side that you switch

3709.04 --> 3715.09
to proof that can't be overcome by that

3713.18 --> 3717.9199999999996
other side that got them completely

3715.09 --> 3721.25
maddening basically you don't even

3717.92 --> 3723.17
realize this I guess been so preoccupied

3721.25 --> 3724.85
by your own stresses that you don't even

3723.17 --> 3726.78
realize what you've done

3724.85 --> 3734.02
to help us okay

3726.78 --> 3735.7000000000003
massively and it's I can appreciate that

3734.02 --> 3739.359
it is insane

3735.7 --> 3743.47
does it make any logical sense maybe

3739.359 --> 3746.0499999999997
doesn't need to okay but yeah would have

3743.47 --> 3747.9399999999996
been a lot wiser if you just step back

3746.05 --> 3751.84
for a moment and just let it all sink

3747.94 --> 3754.54
and regain your faculties because now

3751.84 --> 3756.82
you're just throwing that insanity out

3754.54 --> 3760.6
there you obviously don't even realize

3756.82 --> 3766.81
it you can't switch after presenting

3760.6 --> 3772.0
proof like that it's insane okay with

3766.81 --> 3774.22
reality in plain sight I think it's okay

3772.0 --> 3780.19
that's my opinion you do

3774.22 --> 3782.41
I bet you do you must feel great it's

3780.19 --> 3783.18
very relieving to lose your mind that's

3782.41 --> 3785.7999999999997
lovely

3783.18 --> 3791.29
alright thank you to the guys that hung

3785.8 --> 3793.4100000000003
in there you don't stay like appreciate

3791.29 --> 3796.0
the guys that take that hung in there

3793.41 --> 3797.68
because I'll continue doing what I'm

3796.0 --> 3800.02
doing with a different point of view

3797.68 --> 3802.72
different take on it different opinion

3800.02 --> 3805.24
and interpretation maybe but still the

3802.72 --> 3806.89
same if you'll see me speaking rhetoric

3805.24 --> 3809.08
you don't have to see me but if I upload

3806.89 --> 3810.52
the footage you want to watch it you

3809.08 --> 3812.92
want to mirror that use it as a flower

3810.52 --> 3814.84
prove if you want do it I welcome

3812.92 --> 3817.78
anybody that's what I want to do keep

3814.84 --> 3819.01
taking foolish I want to burn the [ __ ]

3817.78 --> 3821.5600000000004
out of this p900

3819.01 --> 3827.1400000000003
forever and ever you know I carry this

3821.56 --> 3829.18
p900 open down my backpack I'm not I'm

3827.14 --> 3831.4
not really that interested okay there is

3829.18 --> 3833.3199999999997
so much footage out there already I'm

3831.4 --> 3836.2000000000003
much more interested in people's

3833.32 --> 3839.71
psychological processes in the awakening

3836.2 --> 3845.1299999999997
in making other people understand what's

3839.71 --> 3849.119
actually going on in the processes like

3845.13 --> 3852.34
that's what I do is okay I don't need

3849.119 --> 3855.28
footage really I Bradley even use it

3852.34 --> 3857.75
love to press it's very interesting that

3855.28 --> 3861.44
I said both eyes with but I don't really

3857.75 --> 3864.17
needed that much and I just you just

3861.44 --> 3867.11
weird me out do you really do the

3864.17 --> 3870.44
psychology is very important and I I say

3867.11 --> 3872.9300000000003
two words on this psychology from my

3870.44 --> 3876.5
point of view right now as for today

3872.93 --> 3879.62
cult mentality are we for real the way I

3876.5 --> 3886.01
being attack is a cult mentality bro you

3879.62 --> 3889.0099999999998
got to see that no no you personally

3886.01 --> 3897.94
even though yeah you too but older

3889.01 --> 3900.8300000000004
people it's a natural response you know

3897.94 --> 3903.8
not making a literal comparison here

3900.83 --> 3907.04
okay but it's like you're a pedophile or

3903.8 --> 3909.4700000000003
whatever you rape some kid and then oh

3907.04 --> 3913.4
my god everyone wants me dead all of a

3909.47 --> 3917.18
sudden social role analogy bro it's not

3913.4 --> 3919.79
it's not it's logical although that that

3917.18 --> 3924.23
pedo just doesn't get it because it's

3919.79 --> 3927.98
all normal to him that's I'm not calling

3924.23 --> 3930.17
you pedo yeah yeah bro that was the

3927.98 --> 3932.21
wrong analogy thank you no okay

3930.17 --> 3934.82
no it was a very harsh analogy but that

3932.21 --> 3938.36
that is the code that is the effect you

3934.82 --> 3941.21
can't complain about things being harsh

3938.36 --> 3945.61
to you when you do something that

3941.21 --> 3945.61
justifies that okay

3948.34 --> 3955.78
alright ok next time I'll use something

3952.15 --> 3958.75
else well yeah well would it even matter

3955.78 --> 3960.5800000000004
you know a criminal if a criminal like

3958.75 --> 3962.56
did something and then got like hurt

3960.58 --> 3964.2999999999997
like oh my god I'm getting persecuted

3962.56 --> 3967.81
for it it doesn't matter with any

3964.3 --> 3972.76
example it's always the same if you get

3967.81 --> 3977.97
if you do something stupid and yeah

3972.76 --> 3977.9700000000003
people are gonna respond to that so

3984.12 --> 3991.609
yeah

3986.25 --> 3991.609
alright I'll try to find another analogy

3991.849 --> 3997.4900000000002
next time just

3998.81 --> 4001.81
right

4006.75 --> 4013.23
yeah Alex quaint I'm not really upset

4009.51 --> 4020.57
I'm just disturbed by all this you know

4013.23 --> 4020.57
glad I was able to just talk this out

4021.33 --> 4028.1
up until this point at least but yeah

4024.09 --> 4028.1000000000004
it's exactly what I thought it is and

4028.46 --> 4036.0
I'm not even mad at Jose at this point

4032.18 --> 4039.48
I'm really not it just it just really

4036.0 --> 4042.21
looks and feels like he broke it broke

4039.48 --> 4046.2
he couldn't handle it anymore and just

4042.21 --> 4049.19
saddens me that yeah this guy that I

4046.2 --> 4053.6299999999997
thought it's pretty awesome

4049.19 --> 4056.73
he he's gone insane that's the effect

4053.63 --> 4058.35
and he can't see it he thinks no but

4056.73 --> 4061.56
it's okay you know I feel so relieved

4058.35 --> 4065.91
then what does it really matter and it's

4061.56 --> 4068.58
so lovely but you just see where that's

4065.91 --> 4071.6299999999997
gonna go you know right that's gonna

4068.58 --> 4071.63
roll towards

4081.96 --> 4091.319
putting a hole in your mind that has

4084.829 --> 4094.099
certain effects on your body spirits on

4091.319 --> 4094.099
your decision-making

4098.68 --> 4101.280000000001
No

4108.63 --> 4114.6
yeah Hellboy how do I explain the

4110.79 --> 4117.09
analogy the analogy is what it was it

4114.6 --> 4120.780000000001
was probably one of the most brutal

4117.09 --> 4123.72
examples I could give in that sense yeah

4120.78 --> 4129.48
that was too much and I apologize about

4123.72 --> 4133.2300000000005
that Jose but look at this point I did

4129.48 --> 4137.3099999999995
that to try to get through to you so you

4133.23 --> 4140.07
could feel that but yeah you can handle

4137.31 --> 4141.339000000001
it should have known better than to try

4140.07 --> 4144.039
it

4141.339 --> 4148.119
throw the ball that hard sorry about

4144.039 --> 4152.5289999999995
that next time maybe there isn't next

4148.119 --> 4155.969
time in this case I will try to choose

4152.529 --> 4155.969
another type of example

4164.94 --> 4168.1089999999995
Oh God

4176.809 --> 4180.13
No Darkstar

4180.259 --> 4185.98

4182.96 --> 4185.9800000000005
