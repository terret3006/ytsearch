[Music]

57.719 --> 62.559
good morning well welcome to Flat Earth

60.879 --> 66.03999999999999
early bird number

62.559 --> 67.96
196 I'm your host Arwin and before I

66.04 --> 70.84
start the show please don't forget to

67.96 --> 73.439
share it on any platform you deem fit

70.84 --> 76.04
and if you haven't already subscribe to

73.439 --> 78.08
my channel hit the Bell notification so

76.04 --> 80.36000000000001
you know when I'm going live which is

78.08 --> 83.119
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

80.36 --> 85.32
day and please also do support me

83.119 --> 86.92
through the PayPal and the patreon that

85.32 --> 88.72
would be much appreciated and I can

86.92 --> 91.119
always use the support so please keep it

88.72 --> 95.079
coming that would be

91.119 --> 97.079
great right weather today

95.079 --> 99.63999999999999
is

97.079 --> 102.75899999999999
different it's not a big gray soup out

99.64 --> 102.759
there but instead

102.92 --> 106.88
it's sheep

104.88 --> 110.719
clouds kind a thin

106.88 --> 114.32
layered a bit of sun here and

110.719 --> 114.32
there almost no

118.84 --> 121.84
wind

122.28 --> 126.119
so yeah might be a bit of

128.08 --> 135.16000000000003
sun then yeah Cloudscape might change as

133.64 --> 138.35999999999999
the show

135.16 --> 138.35999999999999
progresses who

143.76 --> 147.79999999999998
knows certainly interesting

148.84 --> 152.4
looking you guys

154.56 --> 160.0
say that that looks pretty

168.0 --> 173.319
magical right

170.319 --> 176.92
so hello Richard first in chat good to

173.319 --> 178.83999999999997
see you it is Wednesday the 27th of

176.92 --> 181.83999999999997
March

178.84 --> 181.84
2024

182.23 --> 189.879
[Music]

185.84 --> 189.879
temperature is 11°

193.68 --> 200.56
Celsius yeah the

195.799 --> 200.56
wind 72% humidity

203.599 --> 206.599
still

208.04 --> 212.07999999999998
right so I'm still still

216.599 --> 223.79899999999998
here all right so still doing shows I

220.159 --> 226.04
feel a little bit more woken up compared

223.799 --> 226.04000000000002
to

233.4 --> 237.159
yesterday and I do have a

238.72 --> 244.56
title although yeah

242.2 --> 246.959
not it's just something I wanted to

244.56 --> 249.4
reference the United Timeless Spirit

246.959 --> 252.519
Council of our

249.4 --> 256.959
ancestors and yeah of course the whole

252.519 --> 256.959
Bridge event in the United States

258.359 --> 266.03999999999996
happened it's very in your face

262.12 --> 266.04
everywhere hello a man go

267.479 --> 271.71999999999997
with did car do music

274.96 --> 282.32
music

277.4 --> 282.32
right so again today no Illuminati

283.28 --> 289.23999999999995
cant I am missing

286.24 --> 292.24
them but yeah when you can't really

289.24 --> 295.96000000000004
afford it can't really afford it they

292.24 --> 299.24
needed to use the uh support I got

295.96 --> 300.71999999999997
yesterday for some real important

299.24 --> 303.919
essential of

300.72 --> 303.91900000000004
[Music]

308.53 --> 312.45
[Music]

316.52 --> 321.84
food

319.44 --> 325.4
right so I

321.84 --> 328.63899999999995
watched another

325.4 --> 333.4
video from Channel

328.639 --> 337.199
archaics probably very famous

333.4 --> 341.44
Channel like a big

337.199 --> 343.8
conspiracy geometria esoterics

341.44 --> 347.56
Channel because he

343.8 --> 350.84000000000003
had two shows about the whole Neve

347.56 --> 354.44
eclipse and parts of it were kind of

350.84 --> 356.479
interesting and other parts were just a

354.44 --> 361.12
lot of fear porn which I did actually

356.479 --> 363.56
expect and that wasn't super interesting

361.12 --> 366.12
but another realization that I did have

363.56 --> 366.12
about the

367.36 --> 372.599
whole about the St Andrew's

370.599 --> 374.68
cross was

372.599 --> 377.15999999999997
that Skull and

374.68 --> 380.599
Bones also

377.16 --> 385.199
has that cross in

380.599 --> 386.68
them the bones underneath the skull so

385.199 --> 387.91900000000004
that was something that I hadn't really

386.68 --> 391.84000000000003
picked up on

387.919 --> 394.84
before and yeah yeah that could drag

391.84 --> 397.31899999999996
this whole event into all kinds of

394.84 --> 400.88
directions but yeah considering the

397.319 --> 400.88
whole Bridge event

403.28 --> 407.15999999999997
yesterday there's a lot being said about

405.759 --> 411.91900000000004
it

407.16 --> 414.47900000000004
already and uh like I had my immediate

411.919 --> 417.4
suspicions as soon as I saw the footage

414.479 --> 421.75899999999996
like there's something weird

417.4 --> 425.44
here and uh they live truth did a little

421.759 --> 427.71000000000004
video and he thought pretty much the

425.44 --> 429.84
same thing about

427.71 --> 432.0
[Music]

429.84 --> 435.31899999999996
it that it was

432.0 --> 438.56
weird and that the

435.319 --> 441.96000000000004
bridge collapsed

438.56 --> 441.96
like very

442.0 --> 447.84
quickly like a lot and that that was

445.52 --> 447.84
kind of

448.52 --> 454.19899999999996
unusual

450.639 --> 457.8
because it is not like a it's a Steel

454.199 --> 460.639
Bridge it's like a lot of Steel works

457.8 --> 464.36
and cables and all that and you would

460.639 --> 466.40000000000003
expect that if one of the supporting

464.36 --> 468.12
pillars would

466.4 --> 471.4
be

468.12 --> 474.4
crushed that well all the steel Works

471.4 --> 478.19899999999996
would still hold it all

474.4 --> 481.599
together but instead it literally just

478.199 --> 486.12
broke into pieces and collapsed just

481.599 --> 486.12
almost instantaneously and that was

487.599 --> 491.199
weird that was kind of

493.199 --> 496.8
weird right so that

497.36 --> 506.759
happened and that gave off a whole like

502.639 --> 511.319
um controlled setup type of vibe to me

506.759 --> 514.919
and they live truth he also felt that

511.319 --> 519.159
didn't see anything weird about it well

514.919 --> 522.3199999999999
normally when a giant steel

519.159 --> 526.24
structure gets knocked down what it does

522.32 --> 528.6400000000001
is it'll just like pull on the

526.24 --> 532.36
steel and then it would have like broken

528.64 --> 535.279
apart perhaps but the whole thing just

532.36 --> 538.08
bam just went down the entire thing and

535.279 --> 538.08
that is very

538.44 --> 541.44
unusual

548.279 --> 555.8389999999999
yeah blocking it is an a prominent

552.24 --> 558.6
bridge and it is of logistical

555.839 --> 558.6
importance

559.04 --> 565.16
so but hey you don't have to see

561.64 --> 566.4399999999999
anything weird about it I do and I'm not

565.16 --> 568.88
the only

566.44 --> 571.2790000000001
one there's all these kinds of things

568.88 --> 574.36
that are being said about it General

571.279 --> 578.519
Flynn said it's a Black Swan

574.36 --> 583.12
event oh yes it might be a potential

578.519 --> 583.12
Cyber attack or something who

585.839 --> 591.48
knows but yeah according to they live he

588.92 --> 594.519
did some research and the Builder of

591.48 --> 598.64
that bridge was a

594.519 --> 600.48
Freemason yeah yeah not that special but

598.64 --> 605.12
I mean

600.48 --> 605.12
it seemed to collapse all too

608.0 --> 613.48
easily that's it that's pretty much all

610.88 --> 613.48
I got about

615.12 --> 620.12
it

616.88 --> 623.04
right so I do suspect there is some kind

620.12 --> 626.519
of Foul Play into

623.04 --> 631.3199999999999
it potentially even a false flag but

626.519 --> 631.32
yeah I don't know don't know for sure

639.079 --> 648.0
it's just more ruffling of feathers more

644.079 --> 648.92
burden and like pretty much following up

648.0 --> 650.68
the

648.92 --> 654.88
whole

650.68 --> 657.519
Moscow terror attack it just seems like

654.88 --> 660.68
ring up sure the Biden regime is going

657.519 --> 662.68
to blame it on Putin as they like to do

660.68 --> 665.68
typically and

662.68 --> 665.68
so

666.88 --> 671.36
yeah you have to wonder where things

668.959 --> 671.3599999999999
will be

671.56 --> 680.3599999999999
going not many Bridge collisions to

677.16 --> 682.399
compare that is

680.36 --> 686.9590000000001
true but

682.399 --> 691.24
logically it's a mostly steel framed

686.959 --> 691.2399999999999
Bridge steel is

692.839 --> 698.6
you call it it's a tensile strength so

696.24 --> 701.88
if there's something pulling on the

698.6 --> 703.9200000000001
steel like it should hold it can hold

701.88 --> 706.2
enormous amounts of

703.92 --> 708.12
Weights especially if there's cables

706.2 --> 712.9590000000001
involved

708.12 --> 715.9590000000001
and it just broke apart so either a lot

712.959 --> 718.7199999999999
of that steel actually had metal fatigue

715.959 --> 721.2399999999999
or something that it just broke very

718.72 --> 721.24
easily

722.6 --> 730.88
or something else is going on cuz to

727.44 --> 734.6
me like it's not about something running

730.88 --> 738.76
into it it's about just the whole thing

734.6 --> 738.76
collapse like all too

742.56 --> 747.279
easily right so I'm sure there's going

744.92 --> 749.4399999999999
to be more people that are going to dig

747.279 --> 751.519
into the details into the food to the

749.44 --> 754.48
footage there's a lot of footage from

751.519 --> 754.48
different angles and

755.6 --> 760.65
everything so I'm sure it's going to

758.92 --> 763.4799999999999
occupy a lot of

760.65 --> 766.88
[Music]

763.48 --> 769.88
minds or it was a [ __ ] Bri ship no it

766.88 --> 769.88
has nothing to do with

774.6 --> 780.48
it it's not an or situation it doesn't

778.44 --> 783.1600000000001
matter like

780.48 --> 785.9590000000001
what the hell rammed into it the whole

783.16 --> 788.639
thing just broke apart somebody

785.959 --> 789.88
described it like Legos it just broke

788.639 --> 793.36
apart and

789.88 --> 795.199
just in different segment pieces and

793.36 --> 800.92
crashed down and that just seems

795.199 --> 806.0
extremely unusual for a steel framed

800.92 --> 807.519
bridge I mean if it was like uh an older

806.0 --> 809.839
type of Bridge

807.519 --> 811.48
construction that is more more like

809.839 --> 815.2790000000001
Stone to it or

811.48 --> 817.76
whatever and some steel parts or steel

815.279 --> 820.959
cables holding it together then it's

817.76 --> 820.959
like yeah

821.32 --> 827.0790000000001
okay but this was like mostly steel

824.079 --> 830.88
frame so steel frame structures aren't

827.079 --> 835.8389999999999
supposed to be breaking apart in

830.88 --> 835.8389999999999
chunks that was the very odd thing about

837.04 --> 845.16
it it'll make the brid collapse very

841.079 --> 847.959
dramatic looking right in view but it's

845.16 --> 851.399
just a very odd thing for a steel frame

847.959 --> 851.399
bridge to do something like

853.92 --> 861.399
that it was a robot yeah no [ __ ]

858.92 --> 865.279
Sherlock oh yeah

861.399 --> 868.04
oh got any more Captain Obvious remarks

865.279 --> 871.04
about that

868.04 --> 871.04
dumbass

880.35 --> 883.429
[Music]

888.44 --> 895.1600000000001
like logically in my mind in an event

892.36 --> 899.279
like this the bridge would have been

895.16 --> 902.7199999999999
irrevocably damaged and not safe to use

899.279 --> 906.68
anymore close down but it wouldn't have

902.72 --> 910.72
like broken up in chunks and fallen

906.68 --> 911.92
down straight insults why because you're

910.72 --> 915.5600000000001
being

911.92 --> 915.56
annoying and just

916.399 --> 919.759
obtuse that's

919.959 --> 925.6389999999999
why there's no

922.36 --> 928.319
consideration no lean way to maybe hey

925.639 --> 930.6800000000001
maybe Arwin has a point here maybe he

928.319 --> 934.24
has actually point no no no immediately

930.68 --> 939.56
oh no no of course no no Arn's talking

934.24 --> 943.0790000000001
[ __ ] of course yeah that pisses me

939.56 --> 943.079
off don't do

945.759 --> 949.44
that oh Brian

953.319 --> 960.92
Jones doesn't matter how heavy the ship

957.92 --> 960.92
was

973.44 --> 980.6
it could have been like 10 times as big

976.399 --> 983.399
and heavy bashed into it and it still

980.6 --> 986.279
shouldn't have broken into pieces and

983.399 --> 986.279
collapse like

987.68 --> 992.68
that yeah

989.839 --> 994.759
it's not oh it wouldn't have taken the

992.68 --> 996.519
bridge down no I definitely would have

994.759 --> 999.12
taken the bridge

996.519 --> 1003.6
down but it shouldn't have just

999.12 --> 1007.279
collapsed the way it did that is my

1003.6 --> 1009.0400000000001
point obvious you're not hearing it

1007.279 --> 1011.88
maybe you've already been watching all

1009.04 --> 1014.55
these conspiracy videos all night that

1011.88 --> 1016.319
take it way too

1014.55 --> 1018.959
[Music]

1016.319 --> 1022.759
far cuz you don't seem to be listening

1018.959 --> 1025.6
to me when I'm saying about

1022.759 --> 1027.76
it the way it collapsed was suspicious

1025.6 --> 1027.76
to

1027.919 --> 1034.48
me oh I have to be an expert in civil

1030.839 --> 1037.079
engineering yeah or just know the the

1034.48 --> 1039.679
standard properties of

1037.079 --> 1042.0
steel how that

1039.679 --> 1045.48
works you don't have to be a civil

1042.0 --> 1047.84
engineer to to figure that

1045.48 --> 1050.84
out

1047.84 --> 1050.84
yeah

1052.32 --> 1056.76
let's just say theoretical and

1055.0 --> 1058.4
definitely nothing like that is going to

1056.76 --> 1060.28
happen but let's just say that the

1058.4 --> 1063.6000000000001
Eiffel Tower one of

1060.28 --> 1068.36
the one of the legs at the

1063.6 --> 1071.9599999999998
bottom would be sabotaged and blown

1068.36 --> 1073.7199999999998
up like really blown up then the whole

1071.96 --> 1077.44
thing is going to

1073.72 --> 1083.32
like lean towards that broken

1077.44 --> 1085.919
part Maybe even break and then fall down

1083.32 --> 1088.6789999999999
but the point is is that because it's

1085.919 --> 1091.44
one gigantic steel frame

1088.679 --> 1094.679
structure it's going to

1091.44 --> 1096.0800000000002
bend but it's not going to break apart

1094.679 --> 1099.919
in

1096.08 --> 1103.8799999999999
chunks yeah cuz steel frame structures

1099.919 --> 1106.88
don't typically break apart in chunks

1103.88 --> 1106.88
especially right

1107.76 --> 1110.76
away

1123.0 --> 1127.159
thank you for your expert information

1124.799 --> 1127.1589999999999
you're

1135.96 --> 1140.72
welcome B what the hell you even doing

1138.2 --> 1140.72
here

1145.36 --> 1150.8799999999999
oh have to be an expert oh I can't have

1147.919 --> 1152.72
an opinion about anything unless I'm a

1150.88 --> 1155.0800000000002
[ __ ] expert get the [ __ ] out of here

1152.72 --> 1157.52
you bunch of ass wives I'm want to kick

1155.08 --> 1157.52
you all

1167.72 --> 1170.72
out

1171.54 --> 1174.619
[Music]

1178.44 --> 1181.44
nothing better to do with your lives

1180.2 --> 1184.0
than

1181.44 --> 1186.679
wine wine and

1184.0 --> 1190.64
[ __ ] oh you're not an expert so you

1186.679 --> 1193.72
can't say anything oh really so there's

1190.64 --> 1197.5200000000002
an expert and he says things that are

1193.72 --> 1200.64
blatantly wrong will you still accept it

1197.52 --> 1200.6399999999999
cuz they're an expert

1200.76 --> 1202.919
I

1204.44 --> 1211.799
don't I like to just look at

1208.4 --> 1215.679
things through the lens of common

1211.799 --> 1215.679
sense that's what I like to

1224.36 --> 1231.7199999999998
do so it was just a bit suspicious to me

1228.48 --> 1232.88
but like seem to collapse a little bit

1231.72 --> 1238.6000000000001
too

1232.88 --> 1241.919
easily and there's no followup to that

1238.6 --> 1244.8799999999999
cuz I'm not going to research what's

1241.919 --> 1244.88
going on behind

1246.64 --> 1250.4
it think we're all going to have to wait

1249.159 --> 1253.3600000000001
on the

1250.4 --> 1256.679
whole official research as to what

1253.36 --> 1259.32
exactly happened on that ship how that

1256.679 --> 1261.919
power outage happened and

1259.32 --> 1264.28
why suddenly a lot of smoke came came

1261.919 --> 1264.2800000000002
out of

1277.64 --> 1284.4
it yeah that's

1280.72 --> 1287.96
fine yeah anybody popping up being a

1284.4 --> 1291.3200000000002
wise ass bitching complaining I will ban

1287.96 --> 1291.32
you instantly ly I don't

1312.679 --> 1319.0800000000002
care bridge collapse was just way too

1316.679 --> 1321.5590000000002
quick and easy

1319.08 --> 1321.559
seemed

1330.48 --> 1335.32
off and that just stood out to me as

1332.84 --> 1337.08
soon as I was notified about it CU I

1335.32 --> 1340.24
tuned into Infowars and of course they

1337.08 --> 1342.559
had to play that video like literally

1340.24 --> 1345.76
all the time in the background and just

1342.559 --> 1345.76
stood out to me like

1345.96 --> 1351.8400000000001
hey this is unusual it almost almost

1348.799 --> 1355.559
looks like a a movie

1351.84 --> 1359.6399999999999
thing it's D collapsing very

1355.559 --> 1362.6
dramatically and not chaotically as I

1359.64 --> 1366.48
would expect from any steel framed

1362.6 --> 1366.48
structure that's mostly

1367.52 --> 1373.36
steel the freaking tsunami of derps

1374.6 --> 1380.36
yeah yeah the bridge collapse caused

1377.159 --> 1383.5590000000002
quite the the tsunami and now they're

1380.36 --> 1383.559
all squirting over

1386.72 --> 1395.679
it when I no Larry

1390.64 --> 1398.96
Larry no came to the conclusion before

1395.679 --> 1402.2
the video of they live truth came out

1398.96 --> 1406.88
it's just that when he posted his

1402.2 --> 1406.88
video he agreed with the same

1407.44 --> 1411.159
notion

1409.12 --> 1413.4399999999998
that's why I had the first comment to

1411.159 --> 1413.44
his

1419.0 --> 1425.559
video but uh you can [ __ ] off now

1428.88 --> 1434.7600000000002
huh Ste is not indestructible that's

1431.76 --> 1439.64
right but it is specifically

1434.76 --> 1441.84
tensile means it's has pulling strength

1439.64 --> 1445.76
yeah concrete has push

1441.84 --> 1449.0
strength like nothing can crush concrete

1445.76 --> 1451.64
but still you can pull on it and you can

1449.0 --> 1456.36
pull on it with Incredible

1451.64 --> 1460.8400000000001
weight incredible power and it will

1456.36 --> 1460.84
hold that's what it's used

1464.559 --> 1471.24
for why didn't you mention this when you

1467.6 --> 1471.24
the chat asked me yesterday

1471.72 --> 1478.2
because I wasn't attuned to that subject

1475.48 --> 1480.3990000000001
yeah it had probably happened but I

1478.2 --> 1482.3990000000001
wasn't notified about it the chat

1480.399 --> 1485.559
notified me about it but I was in the

1482.399 --> 1489.83
middle of another

1485.559 --> 1493.01
subject so I'm getting to it now I'm

1489.83 --> 1493.01
[Music]

1493.559 --> 1501.399
sorry sorry that I'm a day late with

1497.32 --> 1504.8799999999999
it I mean every other freaking News

1501.399 --> 1507.4799999999998
Channel and half all the conspiracy

1504.88 --> 1510.3990000000001
channels all made videos about it right

1507.48 --> 1514.559
away so I mean I'm

1510.399 --> 1514.559
sorry I'm sorry I'm a day

1518.279 --> 1522.799
late what holds the steel members

1520.76 --> 1527.32
together nuts and bolts yeah which are

1522.799 --> 1530.32
also steel Richard they're also

1527.32 --> 1530.32
Steel

1535.48 --> 1540.48
that's a funny thing to say that

1537.36 --> 1543.4399999999998
debatable D not a Dutch

1540.48 --> 1546.6
engineer

1543.44 --> 1551.919
yeah but a free mason

1546.6 --> 1555.8799999999999
though so maybe here's a weird wacky

1551.919 --> 1560.24
Theory maybe the bridge was kind

1555.88 --> 1560.24
of built to be collaps

1564.6 --> 1569.12
still indestructible got any more

1566.48 --> 1569.1200000000001
dumbass

1587.24 --> 1590.24
questions

1594.279 --> 1598.52
steel is not indestructible but it is

1598.64 --> 1606.8400000000001
tensile it shouldn't have broken

1602.52 --> 1609.12
aparts broken apart in separated chunks

1606.84 --> 1611.039
all the way into the distance of the

1609.12 --> 1612.84
point

1611.039 --> 1617.24
of of

1612.84 --> 1620.6399999999999
breaking like it did that seemed very

1617.24 --> 1620.64
unusual that is

1624.679 --> 1631.1200000000001
all I mean my God you guys you just

1628.36 --> 1633.8799999999999
can't handle anything can

1631.12 --> 1635.799
you like just saying like hey there's

1633.88 --> 1639.0390000000002
something weird about that it seemed

1635.799 --> 1642.52
unusual and you all like oh my God you

1639.039 --> 1645.039
can't sleep anymore now because maybe

1642.52 --> 1646.72
there was something slightly unusual

1645.039 --> 1648.84
about the way it

1646.72 --> 1650.84
collapsed does that mean your life

1648.84 --> 1652.6399999999999
doesn't make sense anymore what the [ __ ]

1650.84 --> 1654.9189999999999
is wrong with you buch of

1652.64 --> 1656.159
retards why do you have to whine about

1654.919 --> 1658.88
this in my

1656.159 --> 1661.3200000000002
chat why can't you just listen to what I

1658.88 --> 1661.3200000000002
got to

1677.12 --> 1680.12
say

1682.2 --> 1686.8400000000001
yeah I don't mind the chat being active

1684.12 --> 1689.9599999999998
I just mind a lot of whiny people that I

1686.84 --> 1692.24
don't even know who you are suddenly

1689.96 --> 1696.8400000000001
popping up and getting in my

1692.24 --> 1696.84
way that's what pisses me

1697.039 --> 1704.24
off yeah you're not welcome to just show

1700.679 --> 1706.6000000000001
up and be a bunch of [ __ ] in my chat

1704.24 --> 1706.6
you got

1707.12 --> 1710.12
it

1720.519 --> 1724.24
possible they threw an an debatable D

1722.6 --> 1727.279
there was all kinds of things wrong

1724.24 --> 1728.64
about the ship situation itself they

1727.279 --> 1733.039
should have had

1728.64 --> 1735.48
tugboats they didn't have tugboats

1733.039 --> 1737.039
deployed even though that's supposed to

1735.48 --> 1739.84
be standard

1737.039 --> 1742.96
procedure

1739.84 --> 1742.9599999999998
it was all very

1746.44 --> 1753.44
strange so it could

1749.12 --> 1755.9189999999999
be like absurd levels of

1753.44 --> 1758.559
incompetence which is extremely

1755.919 --> 1761.1200000000001
worrisome really that's almost more

1758.559 --> 1763.399
worrisome than if it was like a setup

1761.12 --> 1763.399
some

1767.039 --> 1774.799
kind boat is not a requirement yeah it

1771.08 --> 1774.799
is over there with the ship like

1777.0 --> 1781.559
that hello level with me hello l

1789.76 --> 1795.0
elcott so we'll hear about

1792.96 --> 1797.039
the the

1795.0 --> 1798.88
research the

1797.039 --> 1801.32
investigation

1798.88 --> 1803.1200000000001
was it just a Cascade

1801.32 --> 1806.1589999999999
of

1803.12 --> 1810.1999999999998
negligence was it equipment

1806.159 --> 1810.2
failure or was it a

1813.88 --> 1822.48
setup oh look diver Dan Navy vet I un

1818.32 --> 1825.6
unblocked you and you just show

1822.48 --> 1829.159
up does everybody that is blocked here

1825.6 --> 1831.559
just try to say something every freaking

1829.159 --> 1834.44
day even though they're

1831.559 --> 1836.6
blocked on the off chance that like I

1834.44 --> 1839.039
randomly unblocked you you guys are

1836.6 --> 1839.039
[ __ ]

1844.559 --> 1849.44
nuts I didn't even tell anybody I'd do

1856.919 --> 1859.919
that

1864.2 --> 1868.679
you didn't know he was blocked so you

1865.96 --> 1874.3600000000001
never even checked that sort of thing

1868.679 --> 1874.3600000000001
bro i' I banned you like two months ago

1886.919 --> 1889.919
weirdo

1916.84 --> 1919.84
for

1928.24 --> 1935.88
oh okay a man go I want to discuss

1932.88 --> 1935.88
something

1940.12 --> 1946.2399999999998
okay purified water for drinking right

1943.76 --> 1948.8799999999999
that's a good question there's all kinds

1946.24 --> 1950.1200000000001
of approaches for that my personal

1948.88 --> 1953.5590000000002
favorite

1950.12 --> 1957.4399999999998
are ceramic

1953.559 --> 1961.96
filters I'm using an old berky system

1957.44 --> 1964.8400000000001
which is basically a a two segment steel

1961.96 --> 1967.799
uh steel

1964.84 --> 1971.4399999999998
tank with like

1967.799 --> 1971.44
filters like filter

1971.84 --> 1977.6
cones filter

1974.679 --> 1980.5590000000002
tubes the white ones there's like the

1977.6 --> 1982.6789999999999
the uh pure carbon ones but they

1980.559 --> 1986.0
actually run out of usefulness very

1982.679 --> 1987.2
quickly I use the ceramic ones ones that

1986.0 --> 1990.279
are

1987.2 --> 1993.2
white they last very

1990.279 --> 1995.84
long and they yeah yield the best

1993.2 --> 1998.519
quality drinking water can just use it

1995.84 --> 1998.519
over and over

1998.559 --> 2004.32
again so look into that like I think

2001.279 --> 2004.32
they're called steros

2006.76 --> 2009.76
seal

2014.039 --> 2016.96
that's the ones that I

2021.44 --> 2027.1200000000001
use all right I've had my berky water

2025.88 --> 2031.919
filter

2027.12 --> 2035.9599999999998
for a long time since

2031.919 --> 2035.96
200 seven I

2036.72 --> 2040.84
think

2038.24 --> 2040.84
and it's been

2041.48 --> 2048.0
great like it literally lasts forever

2044.6 --> 2050.72
the filters you got to after a while

2048.0 --> 2053.879
replace but I mean this these white

2050.72 --> 2055.72
ceramic steros seal filters are

2053.879 --> 2060.7599999999998
incredibly long lasting and like they

2055.72 --> 2063.399
get kind of brownish you just

2060.76 --> 2066.119
shave the brown layer off and you can

2063.399 --> 2068.359
just reuse the rest i' I've been using

2066.119 --> 2074.48
them for

2068.359 --> 2077.0789999999997
see like 15 years this specific set of

2074.48 --> 2080.2400000000002
filters and they still work

2077.079 --> 2082.119
great although I am thinking of of maybe

2080.24 --> 2084.72
replacing them at some point but I mean

2082.119 --> 2087.639
it is kind of costly

2084.72 --> 2090.2
so not expecting to be able to do that

2087.639 --> 2090.2000000000003
anytime

2091.48 --> 2096.64
soon and I have some other priorities

2094.28 --> 2098.8
like maybe new clothes and all

2096.64 --> 2100.25
that

2098.8 --> 2103.44
all

2100.25 --> 2103.44
[Music]

2115.04 --> 2120.8
right sea

2117.0 --> 2123.839
water big filtering salination tank yeah

2120.8 --> 2126.32
with enough sand the betable D that can

2123.839 --> 2126.32
actually

2126.64 --> 2129.64
work

2130.16 --> 2132.3999999999996
that's

2146.92 --> 2154.119
interesting but yeah I wouldn't throw

2150.599 --> 2157.28
ocean water into these

2154.119 --> 2159.28
tanks these burky tanks because ocean

2157.28 --> 2162.8390000000004
water is also like

2159.28 --> 2165.3190000000004
has it it can literally like the brim of

2162.839 --> 2167.04
it can

2165.319 --> 2169.56
like

2167.04 --> 2172.56
dissolve the filters potentially it's

2169.56 --> 2172.56
like throwing in

2186.56 --> 2195.839
acid something more to it normal

2191.88 --> 2199.359
okay right well there are these like

2195.839 --> 2201.359
carbon pump filters though but they

2199.359 --> 2204.44
don't last very

2201.359 --> 2206.7999999999997
long where you can literally like just

2204.44 --> 2209.52
take a B bucket of dirty water and then

2206.8 --> 2211.7200000000003
just pump it and it just forces it

2209.52 --> 2214.68
through the carbon filter and then you

2211.72 --> 2217.5989999999997
get relatively clean water

2214.68 --> 2221.359
instantaneously without having to wait

2217.599 --> 2223.92
for it to slowly seep through there I've

2221.359 --> 2226.359
seen those systems not my favorite

2223.92 --> 2226.359
option

2237.119 --> 2245.2400000000002
though but it could be handy to

2241.4 --> 2248.08
have reverse osmosis no it's not it's

2245.24 --> 2250.9599999999996
not the best way to get water at all

2248.08 --> 2255.04

2250.96 --> 2258.16
in fact if you do that turns out that

2255.04 --> 2258.16
that damages the

2258.599 --> 2265.319
water and that has to do with like the

2261.52 --> 2265.319
state of the water itself like

2266.359 --> 2275.52
the gel State versus regular state it

2271.68 --> 2278.0
it's not good like reverse osmosis water

2275.52 --> 2279.04
can make you really sick if you only

2278.0 --> 2282.599
drink

2279.04 --> 2282.599
that it's been an

2283.2 --> 2289.48
issue so if you have reverse osmosis

2286.68 --> 2292.44
water yeah that can work but you then

2289.48 --> 2295.2400000000002
have to treat it very carefully also it

2292.44 --> 2297.2400000000002
it's completely deprived of every form

2295.24 --> 2299.9199999999996
of

2297.24 --> 2303.16
mineral which is not good either cuz

2299.92 --> 2306.2000000000003
water needs to have minerals in it or it

2303.16 --> 2309.44
will literally suck the minerals out of

2306.2 --> 2309.4399999999996
your body

2315.48 --> 2323.079
so reverse osmosis is a good way to get

2318.56 --> 2326.7999999999997
water for let's say industrial

2323.079 --> 2330.28
purposes especially in dry places it's

2326.8 --> 2330.28
not good to get drinking

2336.44 --> 2339.44
water

2347.599 --> 2351.599
it is the best way to purify water I

2352.119 --> 2356.92
disagree but hey you you go do

2359.96 --> 2365.44
that yeah and bacterial testing and all

2363.119 --> 2365.44
that

2365.92 --> 2372.92
it's if you're going to consume water

2368.599 --> 2376.92
then the structure of the water is

2372.92 --> 2380.359
like more relevant than whether it is

2376.92 --> 2384.079
purely without any form of bacteria or

2380.359 --> 2384.0789999999997
anything water should be

2385.96 --> 2390.44
living all right hey Richard G good to

2388.24 --> 2390.4399999999996
see

2396.319 --> 2399.319
you

2400.64 --> 2406.8799999999997
how you get structured water there's all

2403.92 --> 2409.359
kinds of ways I use a Pizer it's like a

2406.88 --> 2412.76
crystal in a piece of

2409.359 --> 2414.88
Steel and it you just Stir the Water and

2412.76 --> 2418.0
it becomes structured

2414.88 --> 2420.56
water it's fantastic I've been using it

2418.0 --> 2420.56
since

2426.319 --> 2429.319
2008

2430.2 --> 2435.2799999999997
what about boiled water that we buy

2432.64 --> 2435.2799999999997
living or

2435.48 --> 2438.48
destroyed

2441.56 --> 2446.44
uh it is technically also

2446.599 --> 2452.2400000000002
destroyed and deprived from minerals

2449.599 --> 2452.2400000000002
which are left

2452.44 --> 2459.2400000000002
behind but reverse osmosis is

2456.24 --> 2459.24
worse

2474.96 --> 2479.96
like a while back when Alex Jones was

2477.839 --> 2482.7999999999997
really getting into water filler systems

2479.96 --> 2486.4
and all that he was trying all kinds of

2482.8 --> 2489.52
things really this is like around 2010

2486.4 --> 2492.0
and reverse also mosis also came in

2489.52 --> 2494.4
there and he was really impressed by it

2492.0 --> 2497.599
but then he discontinued it and he even

2494.4 --> 2499.839
explained why it is because water coming

2497.599 --> 2501.079
out of those things turned out to be

2499.839 --> 2505.0789999999997
really

2501.079 --> 2508.44
unhealthy that's why eventually stuck to

2505.079 --> 2511.5600000000004
the uh to the burky type system he has

2508.44 --> 2515.599
his own separate brand now that

2511.56 --> 2518.68
he's doing it with Alexa pure which is

2515.599 --> 2521.7200000000003
pretty much the same system

2518.68 --> 2525.3999999999996
because it's better you can have put

2521.72 --> 2527.7599999999998
water in that thing it goes through it

2525.4 --> 2530.119
you put it in a glass drink it and it is

2527.76 --> 2533.5200000000004
excellent it is just

2530.119 --> 2533.52
excellent that's the

2541.119 --> 2548.48
difference yeah purest water that's nice

2544.68 --> 2552.48
purest water for industrial or chemistry

2548.48 --> 2556.16
purposes yes yeah not for

2552.48 --> 2558.839
drinking that's my point and that's what

2556.16 --> 2561.839
yeah that's what a man go was originally

2558.839 --> 2563.839
asking about drinking water yeah so I'm

2561.839 --> 2567.599
giving tips based on drinking water not

2563.839 --> 2569.2
on like oh get the pure perfect water

2567.599 --> 2571.839
that's chemically perfect yeah well

2569.2 --> 2575.7999999999997
guess what chemically perfect water is

2571.839 --> 2575.7999999999997
not suitable for drinking

2576.119 --> 2579.119
water

2581.8 --> 2585.119
TDS what is

2592.52 --> 2598.72
that right so yeah I might not know all

2595.96 --> 2601.0
the terminologies and all that I know

2598.72 --> 2605.4399999999996
what I'm talking about I was really into

2601.0 --> 2605.44
water purification like over a decade

2606.119 --> 2611.48
ago

2608.92 --> 2614.44
like I know what I'm talking about here

2611.48 --> 2614.44
from personal

2615.76 --> 2620.88
experience ceramic

2618.52 --> 2623.359
filters are the way to go that's the

2620.88 --> 2624.44
best for drinking water it's what I use

2623.359 --> 2628.359
for

2624.44 --> 2630.16
everything use it for my coffee I use it

2628.359 --> 2634.92
for

2630.16 --> 2637.7599999999998
cooking I don't use it for my tea oh no

2634.92 --> 2640.6800000000003
actually I do use it for my tea

2637.76 --> 2643.079
but yeah boiling it does kind of break

2640.68 --> 2643.0789999999997
it a

2644.119 --> 2648.2400000000002
bit but it's still great that

2653.52 --> 2661.079
way right and no minerals like what kind

2657.319 --> 2664.2799999999997
of what kind of resource do you have in

2661.079 --> 2666.04
drinking water when you literally have

2664.28 --> 2669.599
to add

2666.04 --> 2673.5589999999997
powder to your water like what the [ __ ]

2669.599 --> 2676.3590000000004
is the point of that when it's literally

2673.559 --> 2678.7200000000003
in the water like everything you need is

2676.359 --> 2682.24
in the water all you need to do is not

2678.72 --> 2685.2799999999997
get that part out and the harmful Parts

2682.24 --> 2687.64
out I mean why the hell would you like

2685.28 --> 2689.599
oh perfect pure water but then you have

2687.64 --> 2691.5589999999997
to add something I mean that's the

2689.599 --> 2694.839
clumsiest

2691.559 --> 2698.079
way to deal with drinking water

2694.839 --> 2700.359
ever I can't think of of a clumsier way

2698.079 --> 2702.88
to to treat your water you're drinking

2700.359 --> 2702.88
water I'm

2715.64 --> 2722.319
sorry is it structured copper plate

2718.28 --> 2725.96
that's interesting a man go yes

2722.319 --> 2729.359
copper does seem to have that

2725.96 --> 2734.559
influence copper

2729.359 --> 2737.359
kettles copper bowl pure copper it does

2734.559 --> 2740.0400000000004
structurized water I've heard that too

2737.359 --> 2740.04
it's very

2743.4 --> 2748.839
interesting there's like copper teapots

2746.28 --> 2748.8390000000004
did you know

2749.24 --> 2754.8799999999997
that copper has all kinds of interesting

2751.76 --> 2758.0400000000004
influences in that sense like Rudolph

2754.88 --> 2761.4
Steiner was all about copper gardening

2758.04 --> 2762.68
tools like that came forth of his out of

2761.4 --> 2766.0
his

2762.68 --> 2767.16
lore people that are into that copper

2766.0 --> 2772.079
tools

2767.16 --> 2776.1189999999997
to go the shovel and rake your garden

2772.079 --> 2777.119
and then the copper actually like helps

2776.119 --> 2779.6400000000003
the

2777.119 --> 2781.44
ground makes it more viable it's

2779.64 --> 2785.0789999999997
fascinating how that

2781.44 --> 2787.599
works and it's not from rubbing off

2785.079 --> 2789.599
pieces of copper

2787.599 --> 2792.0
it's literally from the from the

2789.599 --> 2795.2400000000002
magnetic field or

2792.0 --> 2797.2
whatever that involves copper it's

2795.24 --> 2800.4799999999996
something electrical it's an electrical

2797.2 --> 2802.5989999999997
influence somehow specifically with

2800.48 --> 2804.52
copper and there's all kinds of tricks

2802.599 --> 2806.2400000000002
with copper like having a little copper

2804.52 --> 2810.24
ring around a

2806.24 --> 2815.2
tree is very good for its health and

2810.24 --> 2818.64
will fend off diseases so I've heard so

2815.2 --> 2821.4399999999996
yeah copper

2818.64 --> 2823.7599999999998
could be used to structurize water

2821.44 --> 2823.76
that's

2826.64 --> 2832.2
right I use the

2828.96 --> 2836.839
Pizer and I don't think it doesn't seem

2832.2 --> 2836.839
to have coppering it but it might on the

2845.839 --> 2848.839
inside

2869.839 --> 2873.7999999999997
right I'm going to turn on my

2875.599 --> 2883.2400000000002
coffee ah yeah thank you man go no I was

2878.96 --> 2885.599
really into water I I'm aquarius so that

2883.24 --> 2887.9199999999996
that was my excuse for being really into

2885.599 --> 2890.8
water anyway I'm going to turn on my

2887.92 --> 2890.8
coffee I'll be right

2905.76 --> 2908.76
back

2935.72 --> 2938.72
for

2942.839 --> 2948.44
yeah well that's that's very nice di d

2946.0 --> 2948.44
Navy

2952.52 --> 2956.359
vet you go do

2965.72 --> 2970.72
that

2967.64 --> 2973.24
yeah maybe you should realize

2970.72 --> 2976.4399999999996
that the Navy doesn't use

2973.24 --> 2978.9599999999996
state-ofthe-art when it comes to health

2976.44 --> 2983.359
huh ever considered

2978.96 --> 2987.2
that maybe they don't use the most

2983.359 --> 2991.7599999999998
prominent healthy things when it comes

2987.2 --> 2994.0789999999997
to their crew they just use what is the

2991.76 --> 2994.079
most

2994.28 --> 2999.76
practical and the cheapest and the

2996.72 --> 2999.7599999999998
easiest and the most

3000.48 --> 3004.96
durable

3002.68 --> 3009.3999999999996
so hey if you want to believe that

3004.96 --> 3009.4
that's the best they have your best

3009.799 --> 3015.7599999999998
health as a number one priority then go

3012.96 --> 3015.76
and live like

3016.28 --> 3023.7200000000003
that I know that reverse osmosis is not

3020.4 --> 3026.2400000000002
a great resource for drinking water I

3023.72 --> 3029.5589999999997
just know it you don't want to believe

3026.24 --> 3029.5589999999997
that that's your

3032.72 --> 3037.72
prerogative right and again if they need

3035.319 --> 3040.96
pure water

3037.72 --> 3043.16
for like chemical purposes like they

3040.96 --> 3046.359
need the actual pure

3043.16 --> 3050.04
water like for example if You' need pure

3046.359 --> 3050.04
water for let's say

3051.28 --> 3058.96
uh generating hydrogen

3054.44 --> 3061.2400000000002
gas well then reverse osmosis is perfect

3058.96 --> 3065.0
because you don't get any of the mineral

3061.24 --> 3068.1189999999997
crap you basically get the type of water

3065.0 --> 3072.599
that you need directly to

3068.119 --> 3075.839
create the hydrogen gas without having

3072.599 --> 3079.1600000000003
sludge buildup from it right so for

3075.839 --> 3080.799
chemistry purposes reverse osmosis can

3079.16 --> 3084.5589999999997
be

3080.799 --> 3084.559
amazing just not for

3085.559 --> 3088.559
drinking

3109.359 --> 3114.4
okay well the good for you you go do

3115.52 --> 3118.52
that

3118.88 --> 3125.04
I'll use ceramic filtered

3122.48 --> 3126.44
water because it doesn't take any of the

3125.04 --> 3131.2799999999997
good minerals

3126.44 --> 3131.28
out it keeps it natural and

3138.799 --> 3142.96
living hey LSG good to see

3145.52 --> 3148.52
you

3153.48 --> 3156.48
treatment

3158.88 --> 3162.599
okay sure little

3161.04 --> 3165.96
outcut

3162.599 --> 3169.2400000000002
hey I don't know about the exact nature

3165.96 --> 3172.44
of these types of medical procedures and

3169.24 --> 3172.4399999999996
maybe it's ideal for

3174.68 --> 3178.44
that who knows

3182.24 --> 3187.72
personally I I go for the alternative of

3186.839 --> 3192.16
just

3187.72 --> 3194.48
having nano silver involved or silver

3192.16 --> 3197.2799999999997
plating pure silver

3194.48 --> 3199.52
plating as containment for the water and

3197.28 --> 3200.8390000000004
that would definitely guarantee that

3199.52 --> 3203.16
there's no

3200.839 --> 3206.119
bacteria that are going to be active in

3203.16 --> 3208.1189999999997
the water to bypass that specific

3206.119 --> 3211.119
problem

3208.119 --> 3211.119
but hey that's just

3214.52 --> 3221.28
me besides I am not really even worried

3218.119 --> 3223.7200000000003
about bacteria at

3221.28 --> 3229.92
all I really am

3223.72 --> 3232.8799999999997
not I think that bacteria are an easily

3229.92 --> 3236.48
assimilable piece of nature that we can

3232.88 --> 3238.559
just consume like all the time don't

3236.48 --> 3240.88
only becomes a problem

3238.559 --> 3244.4
when

3240.88 --> 3246.6400000000003
bacteria have a lot of bacteria residue

3244.4 --> 3249.0
poo or whatever that is toxic and that

3246.64 --> 3251.5589999999997
is able to build up

3249.0 --> 3253.2
without getting cleaned up that is where

3251.559 --> 3257.0
the problem comes

3253.2 --> 3259.16
in not bacteria themselves they're not a

3257.0 --> 3262.48
a problem to

3259.16 --> 3265.359
me but yeah if you have like

3262.48 --> 3269.88
Legionella which is

3265.359 --> 3272.7599999999998
bacteria secretion from bacteria sitting

3269.88 --> 3275.319
in warm water for long periods of time

3272.76 --> 3278.6800000000003
like that but that's literally the

3275.319 --> 3282.44
toxins that are damaging if you just

3278.68 --> 3284.24
have a bacteria in water like that isn't

3282.44 --> 3286.04
a problem you just drink it it's no

3284.24 --> 3288.24
problem it'll just be assimilated in

3286.04 --> 3288.24
your

3291.68 --> 3298.48
body right it's when the bacteria

3295.319 --> 3301.2799999999997
basically get to do stuff and like

3298.48 --> 3303.2
produce a lot of toxic waste then the

3301.28 --> 3305.3190000000004
toxic waste becomes a problem if you

3303.2 --> 3307.839
have those bacteria and you just consume

3305.319 --> 3310.48
them they'll just be

3307.839 --> 3313.5589999999997
assimilated you won't have toxic waste

3310.48 --> 3315.88
build up because the only problem about

3313.559 --> 3318.7200000000003
them is the toxic waste buildup that's

3315.88 --> 3322.119
the only problem about

3318.72 --> 3324.2799999999997
bacteria it's a toxic waste it's not the

3322.119 --> 3326.599
bacteria they're part of you they're

3324.28 --> 3329.92
part of your body they're in your body

3326.599 --> 3329.92
they have a function in your

3341.96 --> 3347.839
body try to prove ger I don't know

3344.799 --> 3347.839
Richard G maybe he

3351.64 --> 3357.16
did but uh yeah it's nonsense because in

3355.64 --> 3359.64
general

3357.16 --> 3362.0789999999997
as a rule of fist this is what I figured

3359.64 --> 3364.7599999999998
out it

3362.079 --> 3367.88
is the waste of the

3364.76 --> 3371.079
bacteria that if it is allowed to build

3367.88 --> 3372.52
up that can be very damaging and toxic

3371.079 --> 3376.44
to your

3372.52 --> 3380.119
body but the bacteria themselves

3376.44 --> 3382.119
aren't that's it and hey problems can

3380.119 --> 3384.319
form like like let's just say that your

3382.119 --> 3387.359
Logistics your blood

3384.319 --> 3389.64
flow and your pure ification systems

3387.359 --> 3392.64
which would include the kidneys and is

3389.64 --> 3395.5589999999997
true they're not functioning properly

3392.64 --> 3399.7599999999998
well then the bacteria that are always

3395.559 --> 3401.96
just in your body might have excretions

3399.76 --> 3404.92
that aren't properly taken care of they

3401.96 --> 3407.64
aren't being filtered out and then you

3404.92 --> 3413.079
get the buildup of the toxicity which

3407.64 --> 3413.0789999999997
will then yield to result in in

3415.24 --> 3419.2799999999997
diseases

3418.16 --> 3421.7599999999998
as long as they're not in your

3419.28 --> 3423.7200000000003
bloodstream well shouldn't even be a

3421.76 --> 3427.6400000000003
problem in your

3423.72 --> 3427.64
bloodstream you have white blood

3429.799 --> 3434.24
cells I mean if there's an abundance of

3432.64 --> 3436.8799999999997
them in your bloodstream yeah that can

3434.24 --> 3439.64
be problematic right that's why for

3436.88 --> 3442.2400000000002
example having an open

3439.64 --> 3443.48
wound it's dangerous to have that

3442.24 --> 3448.2799999999997
exposed to

3443.48 --> 3450.839
bacteria why go is it's an open wound

3448.28 --> 3454.1600000000003
it's not going to be part of the normal

3450.839 --> 3457.72
logistic cycle which means that the

3454.16 --> 3460.799
toxicity won't be able to be transported

3457.72 --> 3463.5989999999997
out as easily and that's why bacteria

3460.799 --> 3466.16
become a danger to open wounds I mean

3463.599 --> 3466.1600000000003
it's all

3475.119 --> 3478.119
logical

3485.32 --> 3488.55
[Music]

3498.87 --> 3501.969
[Music]

3505.119 --> 3508.119
for

3510.119 --> 3516.799
nice yeah I'm glad to hear you're so

3513.24 --> 3516.799
much into Health that's

3517.0 --> 3521.319
great could I repeat that about the

3519.599 --> 3524.4
could you

3521.319 --> 3526.88
replay can just scroll back and hear me

3524.4 --> 3526.88
say it

3527.839 --> 3535.0389999999998
again yeah bacteria in open wounds are

3532.16 --> 3537.0
potentially dangerous that's why a

3535.039 --> 3538.88
surgeon

3537.0 --> 3542.44
has to wear a

3538.88 --> 3544.359
mask while performing surgery because

3542.44 --> 3548.359
there is bacteria in our

3544.359 --> 3551.96
mouths and if spittle drops into the

3548.359 --> 3556.119
open wound there is an actual risk of

3551.96 --> 3560.119
infection specifically in that

3556.119 --> 3562.88
scenario because in an open wound it's

3560.119 --> 3565.2400000000002
in wound and that means that that wound

3562.88 --> 3568.599
itself is not going to be part of the

3565.24 --> 3570.5989999999997
standard logic itical cycle the the

3568.599 --> 3572.92
blood flowing through it it's a wound so

3570.599 --> 3576.799
that means blood flow

3572.92 --> 3580.079
disrupted right transport capacity for

3576.799 --> 3582.96
toxins disrupted so if then a bacteria

3580.079 --> 3586.2000000000003
sits there and starts multiplying and

3582.96 --> 3588.76
having toxin excretions while the rest

3586.2 --> 3590.3999999999996
of your body is really hard working to

3588.76 --> 3592.599
try

3590.4 --> 3594.88
to rebuild

3592.599 --> 3597.079
everything well then that toxin can

3594.88 --> 3599.599
build up and that's very d

3597.079 --> 3602.079
dangerous potentially can even like

3599.599 --> 3605.7200000000003
cause things like garine and all that

3602.079 --> 3609.079
because the toxins cannot be transported

3605.72 --> 3609.0789999999997
out because it's a

3609.24 --> 3614.64
wound it can only really start to be

3612.0 --> 3617.24
clean up after it's closed and like the

3614.64 --> 3621.8799999999997
blood vessels are regrown

3617.24 --> 3621.8799999999997
Etc and things can be transported out

3624.96 --> 3630.599
again

3627.88 --> 3632.76
okay so now I repeated that for you hope

3630.599 --> 3635.76
hope that made sense it makes sense to

3632.76 --> 3638.28
me it's all about terrain

3635.76 --> 3641.5200000000004
Theory yeah bacteria are a part of us

3638.28 --> 3644.799
they are literally in

3641.52 --> 3648.16
us we have all kinds of

3644.799 --> 3650.68
bacteria and those bacteria

3648.16 --> 3653.8799999999997
assimilate they have to or they get

3650.68 --> 3657.0789999999997
killed they assimilate and attain a

3653.88 --> 3660.52
function within your body

3657.079 --> 3663.4
body we got all kinds of very functional

3660.52 --> 3665.28
specific type of bacteria most notably

3663.4 --> 3667.44
our gut

3665.28 --> 3672.92
Flora those are

3667.44 --> 3676.319
bacteria that help us digest our food

3672.92 --> 3679.079
and turn it into nutrients I mean yeah

3676.319 --> 3682.52
that's bacteria doing

3679.079 --> 3684.92
that bacteria we need and there's

3682.52 --> 3690.52
bacteria on our

3684.92 --> 3694.359
skin that clean out other bacteria that

3690.52 --> 3696.839
might go and like start damaging your

3694.359 --> 3698.88
skin for example that'll try to eat

3696.839 --> 3700.0389999999998
through into your flesh perhaps because

3698.88 --> 3703.079
they're very

3700.039 --> 3706.039
aggressive because that happens there's

3703.079 --> 3708.92
bacteria that are literally there to

3706.039 --> 3710.76
stop those bacteria and and those

3708.92 --> 3712.839
bacteria that are on our skin they don't

3710.76 --> 3717.8390000000004
eat our

3712.839 --> 3717.839
skin right so there's yeah probiotics

3718.359 --> 3722.359
antibiotics are are just

3722.599 --> 3726.079
terrible in that

3726.52 --> 3729.839
sense like

3730.88 --> 3738.119
antibiotics is like an acute method to

3733.96 --> 3742.279
just try to destroy all bacterial

3738.119 --> 3746.119
activity in order to try to stop the

3742.279 --> 3749.68
toxin production but it's it's like a

3746.119 --> 3754.2000000000003
nuke it's a desperate terrible thing to

3749.68 --> 3758.279
do and hey if somebody is like all dying

3754.2 --> 3761.52
like getting ganging or whatever yeah

3758.279 --> 3763.599
antibiotics because they might die

3761.52 --> 3767.4
acutely if you don't something right in

3763.599 --> 3770.279
an extreme situation

3767.4 --> 3772.839
maybe but overall it's like yeah but it

3770.279 --> 3774.799
also then destroys all these bacteria in

3772.839 --> 3777.839
your system that you actually really

3774.799 --> 3777.839
need for your

3782.64 --> 3789.7599999999998
Health it's terrible you have to then

3785.64 --> 3792.7599999999998
repopulate your bacteria a man goeth so

3789.76 --> 3794.8390000000004
I recommend that if you have undergone

3792.76 --> 3797.48
an antibiotics

3794.839 --> 3801.279
cure that you

3797.48 --> 3804.2
take specific type of

3801.279 --> 3809.839
supplements that will help you

3804.2 --> 3809.839
regain the things you need so I use this

3810.72 --> 3817.5589999999997
stuff

3812.88 --> 3820.039
right which is literally microbiol

3817.559 --> 3823.76
Flora this is just for maintenance it's

3820.039 --> 3827.039
just extra for

3823.76 --> 3829.0
certainty but like if you take this then

3827.039 --> 3831.3590000000004
literally that repopulates your gut

3829.0 --> 3833.68
floor and there's different quality

3831.359 --> 3839.0
levels of quality for this kind of

3833.68 --> 3839.0
stuff and uh don't forget to take

3842.68 --> 3848.0789999999997
that right and so often after you had a

3846.039 --> 3851.92
antibiotic cure like that you just need

3848.079 --> 3854.039
to take it like for a week and you'll

3851.92 --> 3856.92
just be relatively back to normal

3854.039 --> 3859.119
although you'll still be having to

3856.92 --> 3861.0
gather all the different types of

3859.119 --> 3862.76
bacteria this is mostly just gut Flora

3861.0 --> 3866.52
where it's really the most important

3862.76 --> 3869.92
just to be able to assimilate nutrients

3866.52 --> 3872.279
but all the other bacteria in your body

3869.92 --> 3877.039
you're going to have to somehow regain

3872.279 --> 3881.0
them so like go out in

3877.039 --> 3884.6400000000003
nature get dirt on your skin like from

3881.0 --> 3887.24
the forest that'll help you regain the

3884.64 --> 3887.24
necessary

3887.72 --> 3893.0
bacteria but do it after you've

3891.079 --> 3895.92
repopulated your gut flow that's the

3893.0 --> 3900.839
first thing you need to do don't just

3895.92 --> 3900.839
like jump out in nature before you do

3902.2 --> 3907.16
that right this is the same reason why I

3905.559 --> 3910.76
recommend

3907.16 --> 3914.319
to to mothers and hippies that have

3910.76 --> 3917.559
children like let your kids play like

3914.319 --> 3921.16
your very young kids your

3917.559 --> 3924.6800000000003
crawling young babies let them crawl in

3921.16 --> 3926.7599999999998
the dirt in the wild and like they'll

3924.68 --> 3929.5989999999997
put it in their mouth

3926.76 --> 3932.2000000000003
excellent because that's literally like

3929.599 --> 3934.96
they have the gut Flora they need from

3932.2 --> 3936.799
the mother's milk right you don't need

3934.96 --> 3939.68
to give them those pill supplement

3936.799 --> 3941.599
thingies so they already have that and

3939.68 --> 3945.16
then the other stuff and they get like

3941.599 --> 3948.2400000000002
all this wild bacteria and stuff on them

3945.16 --> 3951.0389999999998
and in them and it'll like super

3948.24 --> 3951.0389999999998
strengthen their

3954.2 --> 3958.839
system just make make sure they don't

3956.48 --> 3961.88
like actually get

3958.839 --> 3966.0
parasites or like don't let them eat

3961.88 --> 3969.799
bugs yeah you got to avoid that like

3966.0 --> 3972.2
dirt soil dirt that's fine don't let

3969.799 --> 3972.2
them eat

3972.319 --> 3979.16
bugs make sure of that and uh yeah make

3976.52 --> 3981.799
also sure that that the ground is not

3979.16 --> 3984.839
somehow polluted that there's no

3981.799 --> 3987.559
pollution in the area cuz that'll have a

3984.839 --> 3987.5589999999997
negative effect

3991.359 --> 3996.279
fungal

3992.839 --> 3996.279
problems oh that

4008.16 --> 4013.1189999999997
sucks but it it does come down to the

4010.799 --> 4013.119
same

4013.16 --> 4018.839
thing it's even like

4016.2 --> 4021.2
there's different type of fungal fluide

4018.839 --> 4024.72
there's like one fungus and the other

4021.2 --> 4027.1189999999997
fungus will eat the one fungus and it's

4024.72 --> 4027.1189999999997
a bit

4028.0 --> 4033.599
complicated right but I personally I

4031.039 --> 4037.119
don't really see how antibiotics would

4033.599 --> 4039.4
help against fungal problems at all I've

4037.119 --> 4041.359
had some fungal problems in the past

4039.4 --> 4045.52
which is like a long time

4041.359 --> 4049.68
ago after I switched to a full strict or

4045.52 --> 4052.119
organic diet all of that

4049.68 --> 4055.0789999999997
disappeared right did you know the

4052.119 --> 4058.319
number one cause of fungal

4055.079 --> 4060.48
infections this is not a doctor's

4058.319 --> 4062.72
opinion just for the record I'm not

4060.48 --> 4064.4
giving you official medical advice as a

4062.72 --> 4067.4399999999996
doctor because I'm not a doctor this is

4064.4 --> 4067.44
all based on my own

4067.88 --> 4071.1600000000003
experience is

4071.52 --> 4076.68
sugar candida is a fungus that's in your

4075.2 --> 4081.5589999999997
body

4076.68 --> 4084.9199999999996
it thrives on sugar and if you eat sugar

4081.559 --> 4086.76
then that will typically play into

4084.92 --> 4090.64
General fungus

4086.76 --> 4092.88
problems if you cut down on sugar then

4090.64 --> 4096.5599999999995
there's a good likelihood that most of

4092.88 --> 4100.88
your fungal problems of any sort will

4096.56 --> 4100.88
diminish greatly maybe even go away

4104.44 --> 4107.44
completely

4115.279 --> 4121.4800000000005
so that's my general

4118.199 --> 4124.0
tip yeah oh I'll do medication yeah I

4121.48 --> 4127.239
don't take that yeah I've never taken

4124.0 --> 4131.48
any of medication specifically anti-

4127.239 --> 4134.04
this anti that never taken it not once I

4131.48 --> 4134.04
don't take

4134.44 --> 4140.759
it

4137.08 --> 4140.759
fungal powder what does that

4148.6 --> 4152.799
mean Super

4150.52 --> 4156.64
fungus oh what

4152.799 --> 4159.64
another Medical Science Fiction nonsense

4156.64 --> 4159.64
story

4160.4 --> 4166.5599999999995
yeah that is a super fungus to

4164.359 --> 4173.08
in

4166.56 --> 4176.04
in damn it in interstellar I mean

4173.08 --> 4178.719
it nobody really seems to understand

4176.04 --> 4180.92
like how nature actually works and they

4178.719 --> 4182.679
all fantasize with this medical science

4180.92 --> 4185.719
fiction nonsense about this super

4182.679 --> 4188.159
bacteria super virus super fungus super

4185.719 --> 4189.4
this super that it's all nonsense you

4188.159 --> 4193.44
know where

4189.4 --> 4197.599999999999
super things like that come from from

4193.44 --> 4201.12
specifically unnaturally weaponizing it

4197.6 --> 4202.92
by putting these fungi or bacteria into

4201.12 --> 4206.239
unnatural

4202.92 --> 4208.52
environments so that they have to adapt

4206.239 --> 4211.04
to that unnatural environment just to

4208.52 --> 4213.64
survive which also happens to make them

4211.04 --> 4216.0
much more aggressive aggressive to

4213.64 --> 4218.92
attain the specific nutrients that they

4216.0 --> 4220.84
need to be able to procreate yeah but

4218.92 --> 4224.8
guess what rule a

4220.84 --> 4227.8
fist as soon as such a hostile bacteria

4224.8 --> 4230.08
or fun fungus actually gains a good

4227.8 --> 4234.2390000000005
environment in which it can flourish

4230.08 --> 4240.84
yeah it will be aggressive at first but

4234.239 --> 4245.599999999999
then then it will adapt back from its

4240.84 --> 4247.64
super aggressive State because it's no

4245.6 --> 4250.64
longer in a terribly aggressive

4247.64 --> 4253.400000000001
environment it adapts to the more

4250.64 --> 4257.2390000000005
comfortable environment and it might

4253.4 --> 4261.799999999999
even over time a at into it and become

4257.239 --> 4264.44
part of it yeah that's how that really

4261.8 --> 4267.1990000000005
works yeah so you can weaponize all

4264.44 --> 4269.719
these things unnaturally and then for a

4267.199 --> 4273.0
bit they'll be very

4269.719 --> 4274.44
dangerous but as soon as it comes into

4273.0 --> 4278.0
contact

4274.44 --> 4281.5199999999995
with with non weaponized

4278.0 --> 4285.04
environments it will

4281.52 --> 4288.6
eventually Resort back to a more dormant

4285.04 --> 4289.679
and less harmful State cuz that's what

4288.6 --> 4292.04
they

4289.679 --> 4294.4800000000005
do right I'm going to get my coffee I'll

4292.04 --> 4294.48
be right

4314.239 --> 4317.239
back

4344.159 --> 4347.159
for

4374.12 --> 4377.12
for

4392.44 --> 4397.44
okay yeah that is quite off

4395.32 --> 4400.799999999999
theal right so yeah I hope you found

4397.44 --> 4402.678999999999
this all to be interesting I do find it

4400.8 --> 4404.56
interesting doesn't have anything to do

4402.679 --> 4406.36
with the title though so I am probably

4404.56 --> 4409.56
going to change

4406.36 --> 4413.239
that I guess the United Timeless Spirit

4409.56 --> 4413.2390000000005
Council of our anwers has to

4434.04 --> 4437.04
wait

4442.96 --> 4449.4
okay so now it's just going to be one

4444.6 --> 4449.400000000001
Bridge Too Far water filters and terrain

4451.88 --> 4456.76
Theory or maybe and how to

4456.96 --> 4465.159
apply yeah that that's great so title

4463.0 --> 4467.92
revisiting I think I'm going to stop

4465.159 --> 4470.48
like inserting new titles it's been a

4467.92 --> 4472.6
thing that I've been doing for a while

4470.48 --> 4474.199
because I was inspired and all about the

4472.6 --> 4476.320000000001
esoteric

4474.199 --> 4478.678999999999
situation but I think I'm going to stop

4476.32 --> 4478.679
doing

4481.92 --> 4488.6
that United Timeless Spirit Council yes

4485.4 --> 4488.599999999999
United Timeless Spirit

4494.0 --> 4498.8
Council

4495.7 --> 4498.8
[Music]

4501.56 --> 4507.1990000000005
it's it's part of vision

4504.639 --> 4509.2390000000005
stuff it's a great likelihood if you're

4507.199 --> 4512.12
taking DMT that you're going to bump

4509.239 --> 4512.12
into it at some

4512.48 --> 4520.239
point it's where you just connect up

4515.6 --> 4520.2390000000005
with everybody from the

4521.56 --> 4530.88
past it can go very far back

4526.6 --> 4533.84
and it is like it is your family line

4530.88 --> 4535.88
but not just your family line it is also

4533.84 --> 4537.92
other figures prominent figures that

4535.88 --> 4539.04
would have connected up with your family

4537.92 --> 4542.32
it's

4539.04 --> 4543.4
like you connect up with your family but

4542.32 --> 4547.04
also

4543.4 --> 4549.879999999999
with who your family was

4547.04 --> 4552.84
into cuz those people would have

4549.88 --> 4553.92
assimilated lore based on figures that

4552.84 --> 4558.2390000000005
were

4553.92 --> 4558.2390000000005
there and so you

4558.44 --> 4567.159
yeah and that all kind of

4561.32 --> 4570.799999999999
forms a virtual Council of figures that

4567.159 --> 4573.44
kind of represent your wisdom in a way

4570.8 --> 4573.4400000000005
it's kind of

4583.92 --> 4586.92
interesting

4599.6 --> 4603.52
what what are you talking

4605.6 --> 4611.92
about I I'd never do

4608.84 --> 4613.84
that I wouldn't put water in my ear if I

4611.92 --> 4615.96
had an ear infection

4613.84 --> 4618.639
ever

4615.96 --> 4623.639
like maybe

4618.639 --> 4623.639
oil but not water no

4630.32 --> 4633.32
way

4633.39 --> 4636.499000000001
[Music]

4643.84 --> 4646.84
whatever

4649.639 --> 4655.4400000000005
hello thank

4651.92 --> 4655.4400000000005
Phil good to see

4673.84 --> 4678.32
you

4675.639 --> 4680.84
oh God

4678.32 --> 4684.639
yeah candle

4680.84 --> 4684.639
wax that's a weird

4698.28 --> 4703.36
one really appreciate the question yeah

4700.76 --> 4706.4800000000005
I hope I help too I

4703.36 --> 4709.44
mean when I talked about is that is

4706.48 --> 4711.28
terrain Theory based and it is very

4709.44 --> 4716.04
true

4711.28 --> 4719.44
like if you have some issues like bungus

4716.04 --> 4724.92
or something it's always a matter of

4719.44 --> 4729.96
balance the balance of your body it's in

4724.92 --> 4729.96
unbalance in order for that to be caused

4731.92 --> 4740.36
so like regular medicine typically is

4736.12 --> 4743.5199999999995
like oh there's there's something that's

4740.36 --> 4745.839999999999
conquering you it's always such a war

4743.52 --> 4749.040000000001
model and then like oh we just give you

4745.84 --> 4752.6
this stuff that like attacks that it's

4749.04 --> 4752.6
just completely non-holistic

4762.76 --> 4766.719
all right

4767.44 --> 4772.678999999999
and there might even be like specific

4770.32 --> 4774.639
types of foods that you should probably

4772.679 --> 4778.4800000000005
eat if you have fungal

4774.639 --> 4778.4800000000005
problems but as a

4779.6 --> 4785.88
general

4782.56 --> 4789.84
idea there's fungus

4785.88 --> 4793.639
involved probably sugar plays a role

4789.84 --> 4797.32
sugar in your food like it's a

4793.639 --> 4800.36
Worthy it's a worthy attempt to try and

4797.32 --> 4802.88
like cut out every form of sugar and

4800.36 --> 4806.88
everything you eat very carefully just

4802.88 --> 4806.88
to see if that's going to make it

4807.92 --> 4814.679
retract

4809.88 --> 4818.0
cuz yeah candada is the most prominent

4814.679 --> 4820.2390000000005
fungus that's in people and usually

4818.0 --> 4823.32
causes a lot of problems and like one

4820.239 --> 4825.599999999999
leads to another candada that is known

4823.32 --> 4827.96
to like if it's

4825.6 --> 4830.1990000000005
if it's a lot out there they can cause

4827.96 --> 4832.679
cancer is what they say but it can cause

4830.199 --> 4835.32
all kinds of things I bet

4832.679 --> 4839.12
including like fungus

4835.32 --> 4839.12
problem on your skin or

4839.719 --> 4844.84
something or eczema it's all

4850.0 --> 4856.639
related what I'm not Canada smart ass

4856.76 --> 4859.819
[Music]

4864.74 --> 4867.79
[Music]

4883.56 --> 4886.56
for

4893.0 --> 4902.199
yeah you're welcome man go I'm glad

4897.48 --> 4902.199
to I'm glad to be able to give you some

4913.52 --> 4916.52
pointers

4943.52 --> 4946.52
h

4960.679 --> 4962.92
all

4973.44 --> 4977.4
right

4975.56 --> 4982.1990000000005
fungus attacks

4977.4 --> 4982.199
no fungus goes where it

4984.159 --> 4989.92
can that's really gross by the way but

4993.44 --> 5000.4
seriously a lot of fungus actually like

4997.44 --> 5001.759999999999
typically pops up when it's really dry

5000.4 --> 5006.12
like

5001.76 --> 5008.360000000001
eczema so it's no it's just not that

5006.12 --> 5010.639
it's not that oversimplified you're

5008.36 --> 5013.719
still

5010.639 --> 5015.56
thinking through the mechanisms of germ

5013.719 --> 5019.84
Theory not terrain

5015.56 --> 5022.84
Theory it goes where it

5019.84 --> 5022.84
can

5023.08 --> 5028.679
because it can

5025.4 --> 5032.799999999999
just it can get in it can get the

5028.679 --> 5035.719
nutrients it needs there

5032.8 --> 5038.360000000001
so like that look location is vulnerable

5035.719 --> 5038.36
that's what it's

5038.44 --> 5044.5199999999995
about if you're not vulnerable you can

5041.44 --> 5048.599999999999
be surrounded by foot fungus or whatever

5044.52 --> 5048.6
all you like you're not going to get

5051.88 --> 5057.4400000000005
it right it's all about not being

5055.4 --> 5060.638999999999
vulnerable making sure you're not

5057.44 --> 5062.759999999999
vulnerable making sure you have all the

5060.639 --> 5064.400000000001
right bacteria in your system and you

5062.76 --> 5067.88
got all the right nutrients and you got

5064.4 --> 5067.879999999999
got the right moral

5068.32 --> 5076.639
spirit and then you'll be like

5072.56 --> 5079.92
imperious just like I'm surrounded by

5076.639 --> 5082.96
people have been for in the last month

5079.92 --> 5085.96
that are like coughing all the time

5082.96 --> 5089.8
sneezing a lot like having a

5085.96 --> 5094.0
cold all the time like in this house

5089.8 --> 5097.320000000001
around me all the time yeah guess what I

5094.0 --> 5098.52
don't get a cold and I don't get a cough

5097.32 --> 5102.719
why would that

5098.52 --> 5102.719
be it's because I'm

5103.719 --> 5110.0
strong and I'm not fooled I'm not

5107.28 --> 5112.679
psychosomatically reinforcing the idea

5110.0 --> 5115.679
that oh my God I'm in their vicinity

5112.679 --> 5119.4
that means oh the the particle's going

5115.679 --> 5122.2390000000005
to get to me oh no oh I got a gold no no

5119.4 --> 5124.5199999999995
I just think like that's hor [ __ ] that's

5122.239 --> 5127.5599999999995
literally just going to

5124.52 --> 5129.2390000000005
psychosomatically created it's going to

5127.56 --> 5132.6
trigger

5129.239 --> 5135.04
that an alkaline diet yes that also

5132.6 --> 5135.04
definitely

5143.55 --> 5146.879
[Music]

5147.679 --> 5153.2390000000005
contributes what is an alkaline diet

5150.719 --> 5156.2390000000005
it's the opposite of an acidic

5153.239 --> 5156.239
diet

5163.04 --> 5168.36
if your body is

5164.8 --> 5171.88
acidic that makes it

5168.36 --> 5174.159
vulnerable and then all kinds of things

5171.88 --> 5178.28
might start to

5174.159 --> 5182.5599999999995
happen like all the hostile or all the

5178.28 --> 5185.159
situations like candada and bacteria and

5182.56 --> 5187.8
all that stuff it

5185.159 --> 5191.0
typically happens when your body is

5187.8 --> 5195.08
acidic if you take care of that you make

5191.0 --> 5196.92
sure to avoid yeah acid producing foods

5195.08 --> 5199.44
which unfortunately coffee by the way is

5196.92 --> 5205.52
also a part

5199.44 --> 5208.5199999999995
of then it just it doesn't happen it

5205.52 --> 5208.52
just doesn't happen

5209.08 --> 5212.4
then so

5213.0 --> 5220.32
yeah keep yourself alkaline is a good

5217.04 --> 5223.679
way to to

5220.32 --> 5223.679
avoid getting

5233.719 --> 5239.8
disease yeah yeah for what it's worth

5236.159 --> 5239.799999999999
it's not worth a lot luel

5243.119 --> 5246.119
cot

5246.88 --> 5251.36
it might manifest there at first because

5249.4 --> 5254.4
it's the most convenient location but it

5251.36 --> 5254.4
only happens when you're

5256.119 --> 5261.239
vulnerable it doesn't address that at

5258.36 --> 5263.639
all it's just going to like mainstream

5261.239 --> 5265.5199999999995
medicine is just going to assume that

5263.639 --> 5267.4800000000005
everybody's always going to be

5265.52 --> 5270.080000000001
vulnerable

5267.48 --> 5274.44
because it can't

5270.08 --> 5277.639
explain why you wouldn't be yeah that

5274.44 --> 5280.159
that's that's their entire angle of

5277.639 --> 5282.1990000000005
approach they can't even explain why

5280.159 --> 5284.92
some people don't get sick there's

5282.199 --> 5287.119
people that will like theorize about it

5284.92 --> 5290.36
but it doesn't have an explanation the

5287.119 --> 5293.119
default position is everybody is

5290.36 --> 5295.88
vulnerable and will always get sick

5293.119 --> 5297.5199999999995
that's why you need our products to

5295.88 --> 5301.6
protect you

5297.52 --> 5306.119000000001
somehow yeah that's mainstream medicine

5301.6 --> 5306.119000000001
that's germ Theory based Medical

5306.679 --> 5312.32
practice that's how that

5308.92 --> 5315.96
works yeah they don't understand

5312.32 --> 5321.199
anything about the holistic

5315.96 --> 5325.0
nature of biology and terrain

5321.199 --> 5327.879999999999
Theory they don't take any of that into

5325.0 --> 5330.6
account so that's the mainstream medical

5327.88 --> 5332.6
advice you're going to bump into just

5330.6 --> 5337.52
like oh this is how you're most

5332.6 --> 5337.52
vulnerable like yeah or you're just not

5347.6 --> 5351.3
vulnerable hey Stone monkey haven't seen

5349.92 --> 5354.08
you in a

5351.3 --> 5357.4800000000005
[Music]

5354.08 --> 5357.48
while how are you

5363.04 --> 5366.04
doing

5376.58 --> 5379.699
[Music]

5387.48 --> 5392.239
so what's terrain

5389.48 --> 5396.44
Theory

5392.239 --> 5397.5199999999995
it's terrain Theory it's the opposite of

5396.44 --> 5400.0
germ

5397.52 --> 5401.679
Theory it's another approach it's been

5400.0 --> 5404.36
out there for

5401.679 --> 5406.1990000000005
decades but it is classified under the

5404.36 --> 5409.759999999999
alternative

5406.199 --> 5412.719
medical ideas and it is not really being

5409.76 --> 5412.719
given official

5414.56 --> 5420.280000000001
recognition actually pra practicing

5417.28 --> 5422.96
doctors that are holistic do

5420.28 --> 5424.84
get persecuted a

5422.96 --> 5426.84
lot out

5424.84 --> 5429.4800000000005
there and

5426.84 --> 5433.84
worse but terrain theory

5429.48 --> 5435.04
is it's basically relaying the entire

5433.84 --> 5439.28
emphasis

5435.04 --> 5442.28
of like oh we are entities and there's

5439.28 --> 5443.92
these little other entities that they

5442.28 --> 5448.92
just want to procreate and they'll

5443.92 --> 5451.56
invade your body that's germ Theory

5448.92 --> 5457.0
fundamentally terrain theory is saying

5451.56 --> 5458.76
like no everything is part of an ecology

5457.0 --> 5461.719
your body is an

5458.76 --> 5464.52
ecology everything is part of it and in

5461.719 --> 5467.0
when that ecology is Disturbed there's

5464.52 --> 5471.159000000001
something off balance let's say you're

5467.0 --> 5474.159
too acidic then the respective elements

5471.159 --> 5477.239
within that ecology within the terrain

5474.159 --> 5479.799999999999
start to me act

5477.239 --> 5482.919999999999
dysfunctional and perhaps grow out of

5479.8 --> 5485.92
control start to cause damage to the

5482.92 --> 5485.92
hole

5488.48 --> 5492.5199999999995
so

5489.52 --> 5497.88
that just the entire way of looking at

5492.52 --> 5500.2390000000005
it is not as oh it's all groups one

5497.88 --> 5503.0
group is the enemy of the other group

5500.239 --> 5507.4
like oh we're going to invade this and

5503.0 --> 5510.36
then take it over and kill it and

5507.4 --> 5512.92
procreate that's the germ Theory way of

5510.36 --> 5516.04
looking at it terrain Theory way of

5512.92 --> 5517.32
looking at it is no it's all all

5516.04 --> 5520.56
together it's

5517.32 --> 5520.5599999999995
all a

5520.639 --> 5525.96
Terrain and if the terrain is in

5523.0 --> 5529.04
unbalance then respective elements that

5525.96 --> 5531.44
are a natural part of it including

5529.04 --> 5535.8
bacteria including

5531.44 --> 5538.32
fungi they will start to act

5535.8 --> 5540.08
dysfunctional they will start to like

5538.32 --> 5543.96
take in more

5540.08 --> 5548.199
promeny within the terrain than they

5543.96 --> 5548.199
should because the terrain is in

5552.0 --> 5557.679
unbalance through toxic influence it

5554.76 --> 5561.2390000000005
basically relays the entire influence of

5557.679 --> 5565.159
disease to be

5561.239 --> 5567.879999999999
toxicity an unbalance in the

5565.159 --> 5570.759999999999
ecology through toxicity and now of

5567.88 --> 5574.36
course bacteria have been proven to

5570.76 --> 5577.08
create toxic residue right

5574.36 --> 5579.5599999999995
but that's all taken into account in the

5577.08 --> 5581.5599999999995
ecology there is the logistics there's

5579.56 --> 5583.6
the blood flow there's your kidneys they

5581.56 --> 5585.88
clean optic toxicity so it doesn't

5583.6 --> 5589.159000000001
become a problem yet these bacteria

5585.88 --> 5592.2390000000005
aren't exterminated in your body they're

5589.159 --> 5594.759999999999
assimilated into it and then they attain

5592.239 --> 5597.5599999999995
functions within your body they become

5594.76 --> 5597.56
part of your

5597.96 --> 5603.52
body

5600.84 --> 5605.76
yeah they're not treated like Invaders

5603.52 --> 5605.76
to

5605.96 --> 5611.04
exterminated they're adapted into it

5609.4 --> 5613.5599999999995
it's part of your

5611.04 --> 5618.159
body but if it's your body's in

5613.56 --> 5623.56
unbalance then those adapted assimilated

5618.159 --> 5625.44
parts will start to become dysfunctional

5623.56 --> 5628.159000000001
again it's

5625.44 --> 5629.599999999999
like you could compare it to society

5628.159 --> 5632.44
right it's like oh we got all these

5629.6 --> 5635.56
migrant oh yeah well we got we can we

5632.44 --> 5638.08
can handle them just give them proper

5635.56 --> 5640.56
counseling and we'll educate them and

5638.08 --> 5643.44
teach the language teach the laws and

5640.56 --> 5645.159000000001
then they can get jobs and like

5643.44 --> 5647.919999999999
everybody will be taught about oh that

5645.159 --> 5649.839999999999
this this group from the foreign other

5647.92 --> 5652.719
country and they're coming in and like

5649.84 --> 5655.0
this is what they're like and just try

5652.719 --> 5657.159
to be nice and and then they'll be like

5655.0 --> 5659.92
become part of society

5657.159 --> 5661.04
right but then if Society suddenly goes

5659.92 --> 5663.4400000000005
to

5661.04 --> 5665.96
[ __ ] like because the leadership so

5663.44 --> 5669.119
[ __ ] it up or there's a war or like

5665.96 --> 5671.96
banking collapse or whatever then

5669.119 --> 5674.44
suddenly the origins might play up and

5671.96 --> 5677.199
they might like like H maybe maybe we

5674.44 --> 5680.0
should go back to our country right that

5677.199 --> 5683.48
sort of thing and then there will be a

5680.0 --> 5684.679
divide again because the terrain has

5683.48 --> 5688.5199999999995
become

5684.679 --> 5690.28
toxic this sit the overall situation has

5688.52 --> 5693.76
become

5690.28 --> 5696.36
unbalanced and then those things that

5693.76 --> 5699.400000000001
before were perfectly assimilated and

5696.36 --> 5702.599999999999
accepted suddenly become polarized

5699.4 --> 5705.638999999999
against you against the original group

5702.6 --> 5707.84
there of of the country right the same

5705.639 --> 5710.96
goes with terrain theory in the

5707.84 --> 5713.52
body we have bacteria in there we have

5710.96 --> 5717.6
candida even candida serves a

5713.52 --> 5720.92
function it assimilates very specific

5717.6 --> 5722.679
things and then when kept in check like

5720.92 --> 5725.28
it's not going to do any damage you'll

5722.679 --> 5727.88
just have a little can in there to take

5725.28 --> 5730.5599999999995
care of certain types of

5727.88 --> 5732.4800000000005
substances and then your body can take

5730.56 --> 5735.0
care of it it's perfectly balance it'll

5732.48 --> 5738.718999999999
actually keep things clean just like

5735.0 --> 5741.0
bacteria that eat toxins certain types

5738.719 --> 5743.679
they keep your body

5741.0 --> 5745.36
clean but if your overall body then

5743.679 --> 5747.28
becomes in complete unbalance then

5745.36 --> 5750.5599999999995
suddenly they might grow out of control

5747.28 --> 5752.92
and actually add more toxic

5750.56 --> 5754.1990000000005
influence and that's the entire approach

5752.92 --> 5756.84
of terrain Theory

5754.199 --> 5756.839999999999
that's the big

5765.31 --> 5770.400000000001
[Music]

5768.08 --> 5773.04
difference it's very [ __ ] funny

5770.4 --> 5777.5199999999995
debatable D maybe you should stop making

5773.04 --> 5777.5199999999995
a joke of it because it's very damn

5782.56 --> 5789.639
serious and it works

5786.239 --> 5793.36
yeah terrain Theory based medicine

5789.639 --> 5796.52
holistic medicine should absolutely and

5793.36 --> 5799.4
permanently replace the official

5796.52 --> 5802.92
allopathic medical standards out there

5799.4 --> 5802.92
it should replace it

5805.159 --> 5813.04
entirely CU people heal and

5809.639 --> 5814.1990000000005
strengthen based on terrain theory on

5813.04 --> 5815.48
adapting

5814.199 --> 5818.159
to that

5815.48 --> 5819.5599999999995
knowledge while people that just go with

5818.159 --> 5822.28
alpath

5819.56 --> 5825.6
systems look at what happens to them

5822.28 --> 5829.96
they they do radical new

5825.6 --> 5831.4800000000005
things interventions it's like alpath

5829.96 --> 5833.84
allopathic medicine is always like

5831.48 --> 5836.599999999999
intervention based and those

5833.84 --> 5839.639
interventions usually end up creating

5836.6 --> 5842.1990000000005
damage that then has to be accounted for

5839.639 --> 5844.76
and so it just becomes this endless

5842.199 --> 5848.04
process of

5844.76 --> 5850.76
damaging to try to restore or undo some

5848.04 --> 5853.32
damage from a previous procedure it just

5850.76 --> 5857.2390000000005
keeps on cascading and cascading it's

5853.32 --> 5861.08
not holistic it it doesn't really work

5857.239 --> 5865.638999999999
it keeps keeps the the medical system

5861.08 --> 5865.639
busy keeps the money flowing

5866.0 --> 5873.28
sure do people that roll into it get out

5869.84 --> 5876.159000000001
of it and become way better than before

5873.28 --> 5884.28
they rolled into

5876.159 --> 5884.28
it that's extremely rare percentage wise

5890.719 --> 5896.88
yeah holistic medicine's got its

5894.199 --> 5900.44
limits no it's exactly the other way

5896.88 --> 5904.599
around yeah holistic medicine heals

5900.44 --> 5907.879999999999
people to the point where they're better

5904.599 --> 5911.360000000001
like really better better than they were

5907.88 --> 5915.28
before allopathic medicine rarely does

5911.36 --> 5919.159
that it rarely does

5915.28 --> 5924.239
that side effects is an all too common

5919.159 --> 5927.119
word used in Al apathic medicine yeah

5924.239 --> 5927.119
it's very

5927.44 --> 5933.28
common in holistic medicine it is not

5930.199 --> 5936.04
common it is specifically the thing that

5933.28 --> 5936.04
is is avoid

5946.37 --> 5949.42
[Music]

5956.08 --> 5960.639
it have tenus oh that

5960.96 --> 5965.36
sucks itis

5967.52 --> 5971.96
so you're having like

5969.199 --> 5974.28
beeps sounds in your

5971.96 --> 5976.639
head there's something you can do about

5974.28 --> 5978.96
that too did you know that tonight this

5976.639 --> 5980.2390000000005
I had this whole video that I bumped

5978.96 --> 5982.92
into about

5980.239 --> 5984.598999999999
it it's not actually your ears that are

5982.92 --> 5986.599
making the sound

5984.599 --> 5990.2390000000005
it's your

5986.599 --> 5992.32
brain assimilating the sound process

5990.239 --> 5996.04
that is going

5992.32 --> 5998.5199999999995
wrong it's basically brain

5996.04 --> 6000.4
damage ringing in the ears right yeah

5998.52 --> 6003.159000000001
but it's not in your

6000.4 --> 6005.0
ears your ears don't have anything to do

6003.159 --> 6008.159
with it it's your

6005.0 --> 6011.4
brain it's a form of brain

6008.159 --> 6013.36
damage or brain misfunction and there's

6011.4 --> 6015.839999999999
something you can actually do about it

6013.36 --> 6018.88
but it's kind of expensive it's not

6015.84 --> 6022.32
super expensive it's not even close to

6018.88 --> 6025.32
like operation

6022.32 --> 6025.32
expensive

6030.0 --> 6032.4
but

6034.44 --> 6042.04
uh had a heart attack a few years

6037.76 --> 6044.159000000001
ago open the right artery it was 99%

6042.04 --> 6047.36
blocked

6044.159 --> 6050.4
yeah of

6047.36 --> 6055.239
course but if you

6050.4 --> 6055.239
actually lived with holistic

6056.08 --> 6060.96
medical knowledge then you might have

6058.88 --> 6063.4800000000005
never even gotten to that point where

6060.96 --> 6066.2390000000005
you had it 99%

6063.48 --> 6068.5599999999995
block yeah because holistic medicine is

6066.239 --> 6071.239
not about oh [ __ ] everything went wrong

6068.56 --> 6074.159000000001
oh quickly go to the holistic doctor

6071.239 --> 6078.04
he'll fix it no the whole point is you

6074.159 --> 6080.5599999999995
need to learn what causes the problems

6078.04 --> 6082.239
and then live the right

6080.56 --> 6083.96
way

6082.239 --> 6086.04
yeah

6083.96 --> 6088.639
is not very convenient because then you

6086.04 --> 6092.08
have to actually make effort to tame

6088.639 --> 6096.04
your own demons then then you actually

6092.08 --> 6099.5599999999995
have to say no I can't eat that really

6096.04 --> 6103.96
really really disgusting processed food

6099.56 --> 6107.56
crap crappy terrible fat that is evil

6103.96 --> 6112.32
you you just can't do that anymore yeah

6107.56 --> 6114.2390000000005
if you actually do it right but hey

6112.32 --> 6117.5199999999995
allopathic medicine is always there to

6114.239 --> 6119.44
tell you no you can do whatever you want

6117.52 --> 6121.88
and then when it's all when it all goes

6119.44 --> 6124.5599999999995
to [ __ ] all we'll fix it quickly for you

6121.88 --> 6127.56
yeah

6124.56 --> 6130.1990000000005
yeah it's a medical system for those who

6127.56 --> 6130.1990000000005
wish to

6134.36 --> 6138.799999999999
indulge you avoided the point no I

6142.159 --> 6146.759999999999
didn't

6144.4 --> 6149.119
I address the point I address the cause

6146.76 --> 6152.92
of what got you to that point which is

6149.119 --> 6158.5599999999995
what holistic medicine does

6152.92 --> 6161.92
yeah it makes you avoid getting to the

6158.56 --> 6166.52
point where you're going to

6161.92 --> 6169.04
need allopathic medicine to fix your

6166.52 --> 6169.040000000001
broken

6172.119 --> 6175.119
situation

6180.679 --> 6185.4800000000005
this audio thing yeah it doesn't fix the

6183.08 --> 6185.48
betable

6185.52 --> 6192.0
D there are certain

6188.28 --> 6192.0
substances that will fix

6194.599 --> 6199.400000000001
it let me see if I still have it out

6200.76 --> 6205.119000000001
there where is it

6209.36 --> 6215.88
there is like

6211.36 --> 6218.719
a a tincture you can take with very very

6215.88 --> 6222.52
specific plant

6218.719 --> 6225.56
substances that actually makes you like

6222.52 --> 6227.84
regrow some of these nerve cells that

6225.56 --> 6227.84
you

6227.88 --> 6234.88
need for proper hearing ass

6231.28 --> 6238.239
simulation because the going away of

6234.88 --> 6241.2390000000005
those specific cells is what eventually

6238.239 --> 6241.239
causes

6246.96 --> 6253.159
tentis it's basically brain damage that

6249.84 --> 6256.08
causes the the sound to then start

6253.159 --> 6258.28
happening as a side effect but that

6256.08 --> 6261.5599999999995
sound is basically in your brain it's

6258.28 --> 6261.5599999999995
not your ears that are the

6262.04 --> 6268.639
problem I have it slightly as well just

6265.679 --> 6270.84
slightly goes up and down depending on

6268.639 --> 6273.36
what my condition if I'm very stressed

6270.84 --> 6273.360000000001
it goes

6277.32 --> 6285.119
up so it is basically what is actually

6280.599 --> 6287.599
causing that ringing is brain activity

6285.119 --> 6289.36
specifically brain activity that is in a

6287.599 --> 6292.0
way misfiring

6289.36 --> 6294.88
slightly that is what causes it and it

6292.0 --> 6297.92
can be tackled apparently there is a

6294.88 --> 6297.92
cure for

6299.599 --> 6303.88
that The Cure has nothing to do with any

6302.52 --> 6307.719
kind of

6303.88 --> 6310.679
surgical intervention of any

6307.719 --> 6315.2390000000005
sort in fact can direct me to the subst

6310.679 --> 6315.2390000000005
yes I've been I've been trying to find

6321.96 --> 6326.08
it

6324.0 --> 6328.96
hold on maybe maybe I

6326.08 --> 6331.44
can maybe it's still in my browser let

6328.96 --> 6331.44
me find

6337.52 --> 6344.4400000000005
it I hope it's still there it literally

6341.119 --> 6347.88
came up with a if you can believe it a

6344.44 --> 6351.28
YouTube ad pop

6347.88 --> 6355.719
up but I was really fascinated even

6351.28 --> 6358.4
though like it was a very tedious cell

6355.719 --> 6358.4
very long

6358.8 --> 6363.28
winded it was very interesting

6365.0 --> 6370.04
though let me see where is it where is

6367.599 --> 6370.04
it come

6374.84 --> 6381.4800000000005
on where did I put

6378.28 --> 6381.48
it damn

6381.92 --> 6384.92
it

6399.119 --> 6404.08
it's I left it in Skype perhaps hold

6411.84 --> 6414.84
on

6417.08 --> 6419.32
oh

6424.68 --> 6427.93
[Music]

6429.32 --> 6436.88
yeah okay so yeah I got a link to a

6432.56 --> 6436.88
video but it is kind of tedious as a

6440.4 --> 6444.839999999999
video method of dealing with toothache

6449.08 --> 6454.44
I don't know but I don't like the tone

6450.96 --> 6454.44
of that so get the [ __ ]

6459.119 --> 6464.839999999999
out does the technique work on animals

6468.599 --> 6476.08
yes so yeah debatable

6471.679 --> 6476.08
d i I got a

6478.56 --> 6483.159000000001
link let me try to see if I

6485.74 --> 6488.7699999999995
[Music]

6492.8 --> 6497.599
can yeah this is pretty much it it's a

6498.56 --> 6504.080000000001
website I have some confidence that this

6501.28 --> 6506.8
might work I'm actually kind of curious

6504.08 --> 6506.8
to try it

6513.599 --> 6519.84
myself specifically for tontis and it

6517.36 --> 6521.598999999999
seems to be a very serious product it is

6519.84 --> 6527.159000000001
also kind of

6521.599 --> 6531.159000000001
expensive but I mean dude

6527.159 --> 6534.239
it's money back guaranteed 60 days I

6531.159 --> 6536.159
mean it's set to be like a one-way cure

6534.239 --> 6540.44
like it cures it and then it doesn't

6536.159 --> 6540.44
come back so very

6540.92 --> 6545.84
promising and if it's going around in

6543.32 --> 6550.199
general YouTube

6545.84 --> 6550.1990000000005
ads it's probably not a

6552.04 --> 6558.8
scam and hey if you if it really bothers

6555.48 --> 6563.119
you a lot if you if if you if it bothers

6558.8 --> 6568.119000000001
you to the point where you're officially

6563.119 --> 6568.119
been declared having ttis

6568.239 --> 6572.759999999999
then yeah then it might very well be

6571.36 --> 6576.199
worth trying it

6572.76 --> 6580.0
out we have a look cool if and if you

6576.199 --> 6583.04
try it dude I want to know how well it

6580.0 --> 6585.52
worked because I am considering getting

6583.04 --> 6588.36
it myself it's just I can't really

6585.52 --> 6588.360000000001
afford getting

6588.719 --> 6596.56
it but I've had some relatively minor

6593.199 --> 6599.44
issues but I mean it would be great if I

6596.56 --> 6602.52
could like get get it gone completely

6599.44 --> 6604.4
like it will that's what they say it

6602.52 --> 6607.360000000001
will literally give room in your head it

6604.4 --> 6610.879999999999
will like effectively

6607.36 --> 6613.639
enhance your intelligence because you'll

6610.88 --> 6618.0
have more room in your

6613.639 --> 6620.32
head so yeah that sounds like very much

6618.0 --> 6620.32
worth

6620.599 --> 6624.52
trying so yeah

6623.44 --> 6626.719
let me

6624.52 --> 6629.0
know let me know if you're going to try

6626.719 --> 6631.4800000000005
it and then let me know about the

6629.0 --> 6634.199
results and the results should be

6631.48 --> 6637.799999999999
quick that's what they say in the in the

6634.199 --> 6639.36
whole sales video about it which is kind

6637.8 --> 6641.159000000001
of tedious by the way it's one of those

6639.36 --> 6642.88
sales videos like oh this thing is going

6641.159 --> 6644.879999999999
to be revolutionary and then you have to

6642.88 --> 6649.159000000001
like hear that for like 40 minutes

6644.88 --> 6649.159000000001
before they get to the damn point

6651.639 --> 6654.639
so

6659.32 --> 6664.48
let me

6660.28 --> 6664.48
just bookmark the damn

6666.639 --> 6670.400000000001
thing how the [ __ ] do you

6670.92 --> 6673.92
even

6674.599 --> 6681.400000000001
what ah this

6678.079 --> 6684.5599999999995
is way this bookmark system works is so

6681.4 --> 6684.5599999999995
tedious now

6693.599 --> 6696.96
all right anyway I got

6697.44 --> 6702.199
it

6699.84 --> 6705.159000000001
h right I'm going to take a two-minute

6702.199 --> 6705.159
break I'll be right

6711.52 --> 6714.52
back

6741.52 --> 6744.52
for

6771.44 --> 6774.44
e

6801.44 --> 6804.44
for

6826.119 --> 6828.5599999999995
and I'm

6831.44 --> 6834.44
back

6847.079 --> 6852.92
yeah today certainly been a

6850.48 --> 6855.919999999999
unexpectedly

6852.92 --> 6855.92
unexpectedly

6858.04 --> 6865.44
medical mostly thanks to you guys just

6861.88 --> 6868.119
inquire ing about such things but hey I

6865.44 --> 6871.598999999999
I love talking about that too

6868.119 --> 6871.598999999999
so sometimes I

6873.0 --> 6881.28
forget that I do have like a a wide

6877.56 --> 6884.320000000001
range of knowledge in all directions and

6881.28 --> 6886.44
sometimes I just forget it's all about

6884.32 --> 6887.719
what are you interested in at the moment

6886.44 --> 6889.759999999999
that you're going to ask questions

6887.719 --> 6893.04
that's going to

6889.76 --> 6895.8
direct where I'm going to go with a show

6893.04 --> 6900.28
and I guess today was like

6895.8 --> 6900.28
a a medical oriented

6902.159 --> 6906.679
subject so I hope you all learn

6921.32 --> 6924.32
something

6952.0 --> 6955.84
I loving that coffee these

6966.48 --> 6973.879999999999
days did brain damage from

6969.239 --> 6976.678999999999
birth uh maybe the thing is is that it's

6973.88 --> 6981.2390000000005
circumstantial so it's like it could be

6976.679 --> 6984.2390000000005
all kinds of influences that have caused

6981.239 --> 6984.239
that

6986.679 --> 6992.1990000000005
it's like it can be like chemical damage

6989.88 --> 6995.52
I think if I remember the video

6992.199 --> 6998.28
correctly if you really want to sit

6995.52 --> 7000.1990000000005
through it let's just say if it's if

6998.28 --> 7002.199
you're really if you're very serious

7000.199 --> 7005.799999999999
about this it might be worth sitting

7002.199 --> 7008.4
through the entire sales pitch

7005.8 --> 7011.04
video they'll give you like a lot of

7008.4 --> 7012.44
detail and hype it up a lot like oh

7011.04 --> 7014.88
you're definitely going to cure it oh oh

7012.44 --> 7017.119
you definitely going to hear it this oh

7014.88 --> 7018.4800000000005
you really need to keep watching right

7017.119 --> 7020.679
but they will give you a lot of

7018.48 --> 7023.959999999999
background information and the guy who

7020.679 --> 7026.4400000000005
developed it like had it himself to the

7023.96 --> 7028.76
point where he was like going absolutely

7026.44 --> 7031.759999999999
nuts from

7028.76 --> 7031.76
it

7035.52 --> 7042.599
so and he cured it like completely so it

7040.48 --> 7045.638999999999
seems like very well worth try

7042.599 --> 7048.96
especially if you have like Advanced

7045.639 --> 7051.52
ttis like what I got is not that

7048.96 --> 7054.119
terrible I can very well live with it

7051.52 --> 7056.040000000001
it's just that I have thought like what

7054.119 --> 7058.28
if it would be less that would be kind

7056.04 --> 7058.28
of

7059.06 --> 7064.8
[Music]

7061.76 --> 7067.0
nice have dead when you try to go to bed

7064.8 --> 7069.4800000000005
yes richardy that's exactly how I got it

7067.0 --> 7072.639
too disturbing ringing sound that won't

7069.48 --> 7075.879999999999
go away well it will go away

7072.639 --> 7079.52
after you sleep but you got to like not

7075.88 --> 7084.079
focus on it to do that you got to learn

7079.52 --> 7087.320000000001
to basically meditate away from that

7084.079 --> 7089.92
sound that's how I've learned to do it

7087.32 --> 7092.599
but yes when you go to bed at night

7089.92 --> 7092.599
that's when it's

7096.599 --> 7103.400000000001
worse but I mean I think that like

7100.159 --> 7106.04
almost all people

7103.4 --> 7109.32
especially when you get older you get

7106.04 --> 7113.679
these types of symptoms gradually some

7109.32 --> 7113.679
way worse than others though

7123.28 --> 7127.96
so medical shows are your favorite yeah

7125.92 --> 7131.36
Rich I was wondering like where the hell

7127.96 --> 7133.719
are you cuz it's been like mostly

7131.36 --> 7135.5599999999995
talking about that stuff I started out

7133.719 --> 7139.0
with the

7135.56 --> 7139.0
bridge but

7139.88 --> 7144.0
uh but then yeah a lot about terrain

7142.8 --> 7146.599
Theory

7144.0 --> 7149.28
and like how do you deal with it and

7146.599 --> 7151.4800000000005
then ttis came up and that was

7149.28 --> 7153.96
interesting because I had just like not

7151.48 --> 7158.48
even a month ago I bumped into

7153.96 --> 7160.4
this into an ad about it that really

7158.48 --> 7162.638999999999
fascinated me I was like oh my God I

7160.4 --> 7165.119
want that I want that I want that

7162.639 --> 7168.4400000000005
cuz I was having those symptoms very

7165.119 --> 7172.32
severely at the time right I had panic

7168.44 --> 7174.4
attack situations and all that and like

7172.32 --> 7176.88
the the noise was

7174.4 --> 7180.799999999999
painful now it's

7176.88 --> 7180.8
receded I got it back under

7180.88 --> 7185.28
control but yeah I did save the link and

7183.88 --> 7188.079
it's very

7185.28 --> 7191.04
interesting it's and it's like it just

7188.079 --> 7194.079
sounds like it's definitely worth trying

7191.04 --> 7195.76
out especially if it's like it is

7194.079 --> 7197.36
actually a cure it's not something you

7195.76 --> 7199.679
have to keep taking the rest of your

7197.36 --> 7202.079
life it's like genuinely a cure that's

7199.679 --> 7205.719
how it is

7202.079 --> 7207.199
advertised you you do it for a period of

7205.719 --> 7210.4800000000005
time and it like

7207.199 --> 7212.799999999999
completely and permanently gets rid of

7210.48 --> 7212.799999999999
the

7215.76 --> 7220.88
condition like yeah I mean you could

7218.84 --> 7224.159000000001
theoretically get it back by having like

7220.88 --> 7226.719
a severe concussion or something

7224.159 --> 7229.36
maybe but

7226.719 --> 7231.44
technically it should get rid of the

7229.36 --> 7234.88
condition

7231.44 --> 7237.4
permanently so even at an old age which

7234.88 --> 7238.719
is amazing that's amazing that that

7237.4 --> 7242.04
would actually

7238.719 --> 7245.52
work CU you could like get complete

7242.04 --> 7247.76
cognitive room back at a very old age

7245.52 --> 7249.679
that that is just the prospect of that

7247.76 --> 7252.639
being possible is like

7249.679 --> 7254.96
astounding because when you're very old

7252.639 --> 7256.88
you're much wiser so if you then have

7254.96 --> 7258.92
all this room in your head instead of

7256.88 --> 7262.599
having terrible noises to distract you

7258.92 --> 7265.36
that is like a productive quality it can

7262.599 --> 7265.360000000001
yield is

7266.88 --> 7272.119
amazing oh

7269.119 --> 7272.119
Jesus

7279.56 --> 7284.2390000000005
what what the [ __ ] does that have to do

7282.32 --> 7288.119
with

7284.239 --> 7292.28
it debatable D that why are you even

7288.119 --> 7292.28
thinking that that is just

7306.96 --> 7312.199
weird I mean are you just trolling me at

7309.639 --> 7315.119
this point cuz that's just the weird

7312.199 --> 7318.32
thing to say something you heard before

7315.119 --> 7323.679
have you ever thought about

7318.32 --> 7326.44
it like thinking about it like does that

7323.679 --> 7326.4400000000005
actually make

7336.119 --> 7341.92
sense nerves yeah nerve damage that's

7339.079 --> 7344.239
what it's about so I don't think

7341.92 --> 7346.84
circumcision actually like causes nerve

7344.239 --> 7350.799999999999
damage although it

7346.84 --> 7353.0
can as said it can be a traumatic

7350.8 --> 7356.2390000000005
experience and Trauma does have an

7353.0 --> 7359.44
influence on on your

7356.239 --> 7361.28
brain but I mean I've never heard like

7359.44 --> 7364.5199999999995
oh my God I got

7361.28 --> 7368.759999999999
clipped and immediately I got tentis

7364.52 --> 7371.639
like that's sounds kind of

7368.76 --> 7375.280000000001
exaggerated yeah I think that having

7371.639 --> 7379.400000000001
like a severe Blow To The

7375.28 --> 7381.639
Head is a lot more impactful to that

7379.4 --> 7385.239
kind of thing as having your wean

7381.639 --> 7390.0
clipped this is kind of

7385.239 --> 7390.0
weird kind of weird that you think

7393.0 --> 7398.719
that some point in the

7395.36 --> 7398.719
future I don't

7400.56 --> 7406.320000000001
know wow wow you think circumstance you

7404.28 --> 7409.36
think of circumcision when I say the

7406.32 --> 7410.92
word circumstance wow just goes to show

7409.36 --> 7415.119
where you're Minds

7410.92 --> 7415.119
at oh Jesus

7430.719 --> 7433.719
oh

7460.719 --> 7463.719
for

7483.199 --> 7487.558999999999
but I mean

7485.76 --> 7493.119000000001
like

7487.559 --> 7495.400000000001
look spiritual psionic attacks

7493.119 --> 7498.04
or even well

7495.4 --> 7501.719
hallucinations which are often

7498.04 --> 7505.0
associated with brain damage or risk to

7501.719 --> 7507.4800000000005
that and definitely with spiritual

7505.0 --> 7511.76
attacks they might be

7507.48 --> 7514.598999999999
connected with ttis like ttis might be a

7511.76 --> 7518.8
typical side effect

7514.599 --> 7518.8
result of spiritual

7519.76 --> 7523.639
attacks right

7525.679 --> 7532.8
so if for some reason with your

7529.4 --> 7536.799999999999
circumcision you spiritually were

7532.8 --> 7539.320000000001
violated somehow which I don't know

7536.8 --> 7542.1990000000005
exactly like that you really that your

7539.32 --> 7544.558999999999
inner being actually didn't want it and

7542.199 --> 7546.759999999999
that like it had a severe impact on your

7544.559 --> 7550.119000000001
spirit in a negative way well then

7546.76 --> 7554.119000000001
theoretically yeah it might do something

7550.119 --> 7559.32
like that it's just kind of a stretch to

7554.119 --> 7559.32
like directly put it together like

7559.84 --> 7563.52
that if you know what I

7563.84 --> 7568.84
mean so yeah you're never going to get

7566.679 --> 7572.96
out of me like oh yeah circumcision

7568.84 --> 7576.28
causes totis that's that seems kind of a

7572.96 --> 7576.28
ridiculous statement to

7576.48 --> 7583.558999999999
make definitely not going to declare

7579.8 --> 7583.559
that as a as a real

7586.119 --> 7592.88
thing that always happens or something

7589.88 --> 7592.88
no

7610.52 --> 7613.52
weird

7631.96 --> 7638.92
right so yeah I hope

7635.28 --> 7641.679
people are interested in the subject

7638.92 --> 7643.119
that subjects that I talked about today

7641.679 --> 7645.079
I thought it was interesting it's always

7643.119 --> 7649.04
interesting going through terrain Theory

7645.079 --> 7653.4
again it's something that I intend to

7649.04 --> 7656.88
master master the the concept of it and

7653.4 --> 7660.44
be able to always explain

7656.88 --> 7664.639
that right for my own understanding and

7660.44 --> 7669.48
spiritual well-being and to provide that

7664.639 --> 7673.4400000000005
same level of spiritual stability and

7669.48 --> 7673.44
insight to others

7675.4 --> 7679.5199999999995
to be certain to not be lured

7680.199 --> 7684.36
into into the medical

7684.679 --> 7692.599
system allopathic medical

7687.36 --> 7695.079
system which I really don't trust

7692.599 --> 7697.360000000001
anymore for my health at least right I

7695.079 --> 7698.84
mean if you're in an accident you need

7697.36 --> 7704.44
to be patched

7698.84 --> 7707.400000000001
up yes bring me to a allopathic surgeon

7704.44 --> 7708.919999999999
absolutely I'm sure they'll know exactly

7707.4 --> 7712.4
what to do and they'll be able to save

7708.92 --> 7714.96
my life in that moment but when it comes

7712.4 --> 7719.4
to health

7714.96 --> 7721.96
advice right yeah I'll stick to terrain

7719.4 --> 7721.96
Theory

7730.44 --> 7737.919999999999
thanks

7733.119 --> 7741.079
homeopathic option that's fine I

7737.92 --> 7744.2390000000005
guess Homeopathy is

7741.079 --> 7745.759999999999
interesting but I don't necessarily

7744.239 --> 7748.959999999999
ascribe to

7745.76 --> 7753.280000000001
it like I think that even Homeopathy in

7748.96 --> 7753.28
a way is kind of

7754.639 --> 7763.400000000001
unnecessary but at least it's it's less

7759.599 --> 7766.96
interventionist than General allopathic

7763.4 --> 7769.199
medical than the general allopathic

7766.96 --> 7772.599
medical system

7769.199 --> 7775.879999999999
approach but I mean it's still like I

7772.599 --> 7775.88
don't even think that that's

7778.84 --> 7785.679
necessary I know it isn't just the the

7781.559 --> 7789.28
tinure stuff but that is the yeah the

7785.679 --> 7789.28
biggest application of it

7790.32 --> 7793.32
though

7807.04 --> 7811.239
but that's fine I don't have anything

7809.119 --> 7814.04
against

7811.239 --> 7816.4
it I haven't been able to like really

7814.04 --> 7818.84
point out like oh this part is really

7816.4 --> 7819.638999999999
bad what they do there is really bad no

7818.84 --> 7823.04
no

7819.639 --> 7824.32
no definitely not

7823.04 --> 7829.079
it's just

7824.32 --> 7829.079
that do you really need to do

7829.28 --> 7834.88
that a lot of I I personally think that

7832.679 --> 7838.2390000000005
a lot of issues that let's say

7834.88 --> 7840.8
Homeopathy would try to fix you can

7838.239 --> 7843.718999999999
literally just do the

7840.8 --> 7844.76
technique like you could like not take

7843.719 --> 7848.76
any

7844.76 --> 7851.639
substance spiritually purify and focus

7848.76 --> 7856.280000000001
and fix it that way like without any

7851.639 --> 7856.28
taking in any substances at

7859.44 --> 7865.28
all and just like overall try to keep

7862.239 --> 7868.32
your ba body balanced enough that

7865.28 --> 7871.8
problems just don't arrive at

7868.32 --> 7874.639
all how can you do the

7871.8 --> 7878.52
technique I don't know if you

7874.639 --> 7880.2390000000005
can is there like a step by

7878.52 --> 7883.2390000000005
step

7880.239 --> 7883.239
no

7885.719 --> 7891.119
you have to have it in you it's like a

7888.36 --> 7893.159
form of prayer it's just very specific

7891.119 --> 7895.4
you have to understand rudol

7893.159 --> 7897.48
Steiner you have to get into rudol

7895.4 --> 7900.239
Steiner like that is important you have

7897.48 --> 7903.119
to be able to get

7900.239 --> 7904.638999999999
it get the spiritual cosmology of

7903.119 --> 7907.839999999999
Rudolph

7904.639 --> 7910.8
Steiner realize

7907.84 --> 7914.76
that I'm G to blame Catholicism in this

7910.8 --> 7918.28
case a lot of spiritual things have been

7914.76 --> 7919.320000000001
maneuvered around to basically obfuscate

7918.28 --> 7923.8
and and

7919.32 --> 7926.199
confuse the very technical workings of

7923.8 --> 7926.1990000000005
spirit

7931.44 --> 7935.919999999999
mechanics you have to get into it you

7933.96 --> 7937.84
have to take it serious you have you

7935.92 --> 7939.679
like almost considerably have to like

7937.84 --> 7943.4400000000005
become a priest if you really want to

7939.679 --> 7947.599
apply it it take huge amounts of

7943.44 --> 7950.119
discipline a lot of demons on the inside

7947.599 --> 7954.4800000000005
and temptations to get rid of and you

7950.119 --> 7957.4
have to like permanently get rid of that

7954.48 --> 7960.4
you have to decide to become pure like a

7957.4 --> 7961.879999999999
priest and then eventually you'll be

7960.4 --> 7966.558999999999
able to apply the

7961.88 --> 7966.559
technique regularly without any

7966.679 --> 7972.2390000000005
cost but it's it's not meant for

7970.28 --> 7974.559
everybody

7972.239 --> 7977.44
you have to like really dedicate your

7974.559 --> 7977.4400000000005
life to it in a

7978.44 --> 7985.0
way and I did kind of decide to do

7983.28 --> 7988.159
that

7985.0 --> 7993.4
right so it is like do you want to

7988.159 --> 7997.04
become like a priest like a real one not

7993.4 --> 7999.239
just a title with benefits but like a

7997.04 --> 8000.119
real priest do you want to actually live

7999.239 --> 8003.119
like a

8000.119 --> 8003.119
priest

8004.88 --> 8010.4400000000005
you

8007.04 --> 8015.119
know have I done it for a long

8010.44 --> 8017.36
time uh no not that long I've been

8015.119 --> 8019.28
subjected to it it has helped me through

8017.36 --> 8022.0
my healer

8019.28 --> 8023.599
for a long

8022.0 --> 8025.48
time

8023.599 --> 8028.92
like

8025.48 --> 8032.598999999999
yeah almost a

8028.92 --> 8036.599
decade and I've only

8032.599 --> 8040.0
like a few years ago started to simulate

8036.599 --> 8042.32
him simulate his actions I never asked

8040.0 --> 8046.8
him like how can I do that no I just

8042.32 --> 8049.0
started doing it I started to basically

8046.8 --> 8052.0
copy

8049.0 --> 8055.079
simulate the energy and the verbal

8052.0 --> 8057.96
processes like like a parrot literally

8055.079 --> 8061.36
copying what he would do over the phone

8057.96 --> 8064.2390000000005
to desperately try to reenact that

8061.36 --> 8068.199
entire process on myself and then it

8064.239 --> 8070.879999999999
turned out to work just like what that

8068.199 --> 8073.079
worked I don't even understand what I

8070.88 --> 8075.32
literally didn't even understand what it

8073.079 --> 8078.44
was like what I was saying what that

8075.32 --> 8082.04
actually all meant I didn't believe in

8078.44 --> 8085.32
it I didn't understand it but I just

8082.04 --> 8088.0
started to copy it and then it started

8085.32 --> 8090.079
working and that blew me away so much

8088.0 --> 8092.48
that I was like okay I'm really going to

8090.079 --> 8096.84
learn to do this

8092.48 --> 8100.239
and nobody taught me how to do it I just

8096.84 --> 8102.4400000000005
copied it from my healer doing it and

8100.239 --> 8105.0
that's apparently how you learn

8102.44 --> 8109.4
it there is

8105.0 --> 8113.559
no written version on what you should do

8109.4 --> 8115.759999999999
that is like absolute it's not like a

8113.559 --> 8117.559
prayer that is standardized or something

8115.76 --> 8119.400000000001
no it is a

8117.559 --> 8122.28
dynamic

8119.4 --> 8124.239
process that every body does kind of

8122.28 --> 8127.0
uniquely apparent everybody does it in

8124.239 --> 8130.239
their own way and that just

8127.0 --> 8133.96
happens is like a calling you just start

8130.239 --> 8138.04
doing it you feel called to do

8133.96 --> 8139.719
it and then you get the misconceptions

8138.04 --> 8143.119
about what it is that you're actually

8139.719 --> 8147.36
doing out of the way as you get better

8143.119 --> 8151.04
at it so at first I thought like wow I'm

8147.36 --> 8153.48
doing this like I'm the magician I'm

8151.04 --> 8155.5199999999995
like doing the healing oh it's because I

8153.48 --> 8158.04
invoke the words but no that's actually

8155.52 --> 8161.52
not it at

8158.04 --> 8161.5199999999995
all you're

8162.92 --> 8169.0
just yeah you you the one that basically

8167.079 --> 8171.32
asks it invokes

8169.0 --> 8175.48
it but it's your

8171.32 --> 8179.44
guides on the other side Spirit guides

8175.48 --> 8182.32
that actually do the things that you

8179.44 --> 8184.598999999999
invoke me as a person I don't do

8182.32 --> 8187.719
anything I basically

8184.599 --> 8190.559
just ask request or

8187.719 --> 8192.559
command them to do it and then there are

8190.559 --> 8195.719000000001
certain

8192.559 --> 8197.319
conditions and I have to like also learn

8195.719 --> 8200.678999999998
which was very hard at the beginning to

8197.319 --> 8203.0
actually ask them yeah I have to ask

8200.679 --> 8205.84
questions and wait for answers and that

8203.0 --> 8208.519
happens and it's very bizarre it's very

8205.84 --> 8211.599
bizarre when you literally like

8208.519 --> 8213.439
get verbal auditory

8211.599 --> 8215.24
communication when you ask these

8213.439 --> 8217.08
questions it's quite freaking surreal

8215.24 --> 8220.199999999999
it's like holy

8217.08 --> 8222.84
[ __ ] I'm actually getting answers I can

8220.2 --> 8225.319000000001
literally hear it

8222.84 --> 8228.28
now and sometimes those answers are

8225.319 --> 8231.16
unexpected because the Dynamics of what

8228.28 --> 8233.12
thing how these things work is not

8231.16 --> 8238.0
always

8233.12 --> 8242.679
uniform sometimes you just can't heal

8238.0 --> 8245.76
somebody and there's like a a Reon for

8242.679 --> 8248.559
that it's like the more I apply it the

8245.76 --> 8252.0
more you realize that I'm just a

8248.559 --> 8255.96
pawn in like this

8252.0 --> 8259.16
Cosmic game of God and the angels and

8255.96 --> 8261.518999999998
the guides and they're working according

8259.16 --> 8265.399
to a rule set that is

8261.519 --> 8266.76
basically made by God and sometimes you

8265.399 --> 8268.88
can't heal

8266.76 --> 8271.92
people sometimes they're like it's

8268.88 --> 8273.8
forbidden to do that and Yeah the more

8271.92 --> 8277.12
the better I get at it the more you can

8273.8 --> 8279.08
feel it out like that person is like

8277.12 --> 8282.639000000001
locked in with their own

8279.08 --> 8285.399
demons and you can't heal them because

8282.639 --> 8288.639
they will prevent you from healing them

8285.399 --> 8290.479
because they are in a deal with their

8288.639 --> 8292.438999999998
own demons and they have to work that

8290.479 --> 8295.639
out naturally which usually leads to

8292.439 --> 8299.12
them paying a price for

8295.639 --> 8301.559
it and then maybe at some point they'll

8299.12 --> 8306.319000000001
lock out they'll stop doing that and

8301.559 --> 8308.719
then they can be healed again it's

8306.319 --> 8311.49
complicated and it's

8308.719 --> 8314.689999999999
surreal welcome to my

8311.49 --> 8314.69
[Music]

8319.519 --> 8327.92
world so yeah I'd love to give pointers

8323.84 --> 8327.92
but it'll have to be on a oneon-one

8328.24 --> 8334.399
because this stuff is kind of s

8332.16 --> 8336.84
senstive the technique is kind of

8334.399 --> 8338.08
sensitive I can't just like give you a

8336.84 --> 8342.679
full on

8338.08 --> 8342.679
instruction manual just like

8343.359 --> 8349.08
that

8344.92 --> 8353.519
like sounds weird I'm not allowed

8349.08 --> 8353.519
to and it wouldn't work

8354.76 --> 8361.0
anyway but if i' attempt to and I have

8357.92 --> 8363.8
actually attempted it in the past I

8361.0 --> 8369.439
become disrupted while I do it it's like

8363.8 --> 8371.599
God intervenes and just like like oh it

8369.439 --> 8373.28
suddenly disruption oh suddenly I lose

8371.599 --> 8375.2
my concentration oh suddenly somebody

8373.28 --> 8377.639000000001
asked a brilliant question about

8375.2 --> 8382.599
something else and I have to address it

8377.639 --> 8386.319
like God will just intervene like

8382.599 --> 8389.12
no you're not going to do that and this

8386.319 --> 8390.92
by the way happens other times as well

8389.12 --> 8393.479000000001
like even on phone calls with my friend

8390.92 --> 8397.04
in a who is very much aware about this

8393.479 --> 8398.039999999999
technique and is applying it herself on

8397.04 --> 8400.560000000001
her own

8398.04 --> 8403.080000000002
initiative yeah she's also involved in

8400.56 --> 8406.199999999999
like Waldorf School her daughter is in

8403.08 --> 8409.16
one and so she's very interested she's

8406.2 --> 8411.52
very talented when it comes to spiritual

8409.16 --> 8414.84
things and so she like naturally like

8411.52 --> 8417.319000000001
yeah I do that I do that too in my own

8414.84 --> 8419.76
way and like we're coming together in

8417.319 --> 8422.24
understanding of that but when we then

8419.76 --> 8424.880000000001
just like

8422.24 --> 8427.84
mix ideas and just think about it and

8424.88 --> 8431.279999999999
consider things then if I turn a wrong

8427.84 --> 8434.16
direction if I get like if a luciferian

8431.28 --> 8436.319000000001
idea slips in and it can happen it has

8434.16 --> 8439.24
happened a couple of times there like

8436.319 --> 8444.24
literally an immediate punishment from

8439.24 --> 8448.439
God who like Cuts our phone

8444.24 --> 8450.84
off like talking for an hour or more and

8448.439 --> 8454.04
like as soon as the luciferian idea

8450.84 --> 8454.04
slips in I say it and

8454.84 --> 8460.24
it's and like I'm as soon as I then said

8458.439 --> 8463.04
like okay

8460.24 --> 8464.479
apparently what I said was wrong I have

8463.04 --> 8467.76
to

8464.479 --> 8469.84
like repent from that conception I have

8467.76 --> 8472.04
to like completely Let It Go not let it

8469.84 --> 8473.8
sink in Let It Go like I can't do that

8472.04 --> 8476.880000000001
and guess

8473.8 --> 8481.519999999999
what yeah what happened yeah we got

8476.88 --> 8483.88
disconnected because I had a wrong idea

8481.52 --> 8486.0
and I recognize that now like that

8483.88 --> 8489.16
happened one time

8486.0 --> 8489.16
it's I

8491.68 --> 8500.439
mean it is what it is it's kind of

8495.92 --> 8503.88
magical it's kind of weird but when you

8500.439 --> 8508.28
go full Wizard and you go full energy

8503.88 --> 8510.839999999998
and really think on high levels and like

8508.28 --> 8513.479000000001
have deep esoteric discussion with

8510.84 --> 8515.960000000001
somebody you're really well played into

8513.479 --> 8519.039999999999
and you then take a wrong turn like that

8515.96 --> 8521.319
has like immediate

8519.04 --> 8524.319000000001
consequences

8521.319 --> 8527.8
like it just feels like there's a whole

8524.319 --> 8530.08
bunch of like Spirits like weighing in

8527.8 --> 8533.319
on it on that situation and if you take

8530.08 --> 8537.319
a wrong turn somehow they're like

8533.319 --> 8539.84
immediately bad call punishment

8537.319 --> 8541.199999999999
disrupting that like immediately sign

8539.84 --> 8544.12
like you have to stop stop that right

8541.2 --> 8547.890000000001
now and it that gen

8544.12 --> 8550.980000000001
happens I mean it's quite

8547.89 --> 8550.98
[Music]

8553.319 --> 8560.24
magical going to Health Center in

8555.6 --> 8563.800000000001
providing no no no there no freaking

8560.24 --> 8566.439
Point these people if you're going to go

8563.8 --> 8568.72
if you're going to go to the hospital

8566.439 --> 8573.24
and make a contract with the allopathic

8568.72 --> 8573.24
medical system you're in a

8573.399 --> 8580.358999999999
contract yeah only if those

8576.76 --> 8582.92
people that have done that realize I

8580.359 --> 8582.92
made a

8583.12 --> 8592.0
mistake I wish I hadn't done

8586.04 --> 8594.12
that that's when I can then try to fix

8592.0 --> 8596.52
it using the

8594.12 --> 8598.92
technique but a lot of these people that

8596.52 --> 8600.640000000001
are in the hospitals there you know what

8598.92 --> 8603.399
if I told them about this you know what

8600.64 --> 8606.24
they do they'd say get the hell out of

8603.399 --> 8610.08
here you scam artist yeah that's what

8606.24 --> 8613.68
they'd say because they're contracted in

8610.08 --> 8615.08
the system they have a contract you

8613.68 --> 8617.800000000001
can't

8615.08 --> 8619.96
intervene when somebody is in a

8617.8 --> 8623.199999999999
spiritual

8619.96 --> 8626.599999999999
contract with those with that

8623.2 --> 8632.439
entity with what is behind that

8626.6 --> 8632.439
system you can't intervene in a contract

8632.72 --> 8638.09
yeah I tried to tell you about

8634.98 --> 8638.09
[Music]

8644.68 --> 8650.6
this no it doesn't work like

8647.479 --> 8653.24
that you can't just secretly I'm going

8650.6 --> 8655.880000000001
to secretly Heal the World yeah you know

8653.24 --> 8658.56
what that is completely useless and a

8655.88 --> 8663.199999999999
freaking waste of time that's what that

8658.56 --> 8665.319
is now I'll stick to Healing people that

8663.2 --> 8668.84
are open for

8665.319 --> 8672.08
it yeah instead of just wasting my time

8668.84 --> 8676.2
trying to heal people that really don't

8672.08 --> 8676.2
care cuz they're not

8676.92 --> 8683.56
interested yeah it doesn't work that way

8679.6 --> 8686.2
debatable D we can't just conquer the

8683.56 --> 8689.039999999999
world with the technique and then like

8686.2 --> 8691.2
I'm going to convert everybody to

8689.04 --> 8693.160000000002
Rudolph Steiner and Ling the technique

8691.2 --> 8695.04
and they're just I'm just going to heal

8693.16 --> 8697.52
them and they'll accept me and then it

8695.04 --> 8704.52
will be the new world religion

8697.52 --> 8707.52
no no no it doesn't work like that

8704.52 --> 8707.52
stop

8718.479 --> 8722.8
stop yeah get get over

8723.439 --> 8730.12
it it doesn't work like

8726.96 --> 8734.319
that if you want it to be a part of your

8730.12 --> 8736.2
life then you can choose to do that but

8734.319 --> 8739.16
it's a tough

8736.2 --> 8742.279
road very

8739.16 --> 8745.0
confronting you will feel the

8742.279 --> 8747.359
polarization between you and the rest of

8745.0 --> 8750.68
the world more than ever

8747.359 --> 8753.08
before you will have to choose that

8750.68 --> 8758.279
choose that you will do that in order to

8753.08 --> 8762.76
even attain this yeah you can't force it

8758.279 --> 8769.0
on the world you can't force Ascension

8762.76 --> 8772.960000000001
on the world you just can't you just

8769.0 --> 8772.96
can't doesn't work that

8774.08 --> 8779.24
way you have to get over

8777.279 --> 8781.76
it

8779.24 --> 8783.16
yeah

8781.76 --> 8787.68
you can

8783.16 --> 8787.68
only choose it

8789.96 --> 8796.479
yourself and if there's a calling right

8793.24 --> 8799.96
I apply the technique as a calling I get

8796.479 --> 8803.438999999998
called to do it it's like hey this

8799.96 --> 8807.16
person you can do that right

8803.439 --> 8807.16
now and then I do

8809.24 --> 8814.08
it

8811.56 --> 8814.08
that's how it

8817.6 --> 8823.359
works you can't force it and you can't

8820.68 --> 8823.359
convert

8824.68 --> 8830.52
people can't convert people it doesn't

8827.2 --> 8833.240000000002
work that way this is not a cult system

8830.52 --> 8835.880000000001
this is not like a religion where it's

8833.24 --> 8837.92
like oh you have to say the riddle you

8835.88 --> 8841.0
have to go through this ritual and now

8837.92 --> 8844.6
you're part of us yeah it doesn't work

8841.0 --> 8844.6
like that it's not a

8862.16 --> 8866.0
religion Ascension

8866.04 --> 8872.12
yes what you don't know what the word

8868.319 --> 8872.119999999999
ascension means

8873.84 --> 8876.68
spiritually

8878.8 --> 8883.56
rise become more whole become more

8884.96 --> 8891.199999999999
pure cast off your

8888.52 --> 8894.720000000001
sins on different

8891.2 --> 8897.92
levels more you ascend the more you will

8894.72 --> 8897.92
have to cast off your

8899.12 --> 8902.12
sins

8902.56 --> 8908.76
you can see Ascension also as

8905.359 --> 8911.68
like Ascension is when you're finally

8908.76 --> 8916.16
ready to let go of your sins certain

8911.68 --> 8918.12
sins that is Ascension you can't force

8916.16 --> 8921.359
yourself to get rid of sins if you're

8918.12 --> 8925.2
not ready to do it when you are ready to

8921.359 --> 8925.2
do it that is when Ascension

8929.04 --> 8932.04
happens

8939.8 --> 8946.88
wow I can't believe

8941.76 --> 8946.880000000001
like how this show has progressed in its

8947.12 --> 8954.439
subjects from just new stuff out there

8951.12 --> 8957.0
and then to like water filters then into

8954.439 --> 8959.04
terrain Theory and now like straight on

8957.0 --> 8961.08
to spiritualism and the

8959.04 --> 8964.160000000002
technique

8961.08 --> 8964.16
it's kind of

8965.439 --> 8972.439
remarkable like straight out from the

8968.279 --> 8975.24
dirt into the high like slowly climbing

8972.439 --> 8978.24
up into the highest

8975.24 --> 8978.24
regions

8984.08 --> 8990.279
interesting no could you make money with

8987.479 --> 8992.479
the thing how about shut the [ __ ] up

8990.279 --> 8997.560000000001
about [ __ ] making

8992.479 --> 8997.56
money I'm sorry it's just

9005.12 --> 9012.439
no it's like is that all you care

9009.56 --> 9014.76
about I'm figuring out as a spiritual

9012.439 --> 9017.04
Ascension I can do like miraculous

9014.76 --> 9020.72
things that I think are miraculous and

9017.04 --> 9023.160000000002
your only question is could you make

9020.72 --> 9026.399
money [ __ ] your

9023.16 --> 9030.119999999999
money yeah give it to

9026.399 --> 9033.92
me give me your money I'm not going to

9030.12 --> 9038.08
put a price on what I consider to be a

9033.92 --> 9038.08
holy thing

9038.2 --> 9043.84
yeah I mean you want to immediately

9041.439 --> 9047.56
corrupt something that is considerably

9043.84 --> 9051.92
Holy by just putting a freaking

9047.56 --> 9055.92
Earthly price on it it's that's

9051.92 --> 9059.439
perverted why so angry because you're

9055.92 --> 9061.52
perverting something that is really holy

9059.439 --> 9066.12
in my

9061.52 --> 9066.12
opinion yeah you don't put a price on

9067.68 --> 9075.0
that it's a

9070.6 --> 9078.479000000001
reward it's a reward you get you don't

9075.0 --> 9078.479
put a price on

9078.92 --> 9081.92
that

9082.6 --> 9086.960000000001
you're literally just one step away from

9084.96 --> 9089.88
getting banned ethnic one it's you're

9086.96 --> 9089.88
really pissing me

9093.76 --> 9096.76
off

9097.64 --> 9102.479
yeah you know what I could make money of

9101.2 --> 9105.92
telling

9102.479 --> 9110.358999999999
you interesting things that you can

9105.92 --> 9114.12
learn about maybe apply to your life

9110.359 --> 9117.439
and then on a voluntary basis you can

9114.12 --> 9120.399000000001
give me money in thanks of the

9117.439 --> 9124.2
information that I am giving out for

9120.399 --> 9127.039999999999
free for everybody to be able to use or

9124.2 --> 9130.479000000001
to learn about to get into yeah I'm

9127.04 --> 9132.359
giving it to you for free now if you

9130.479 --> 9135.72
value that

9132.359 --> 9140.12
information then you can give me money

9135.72 --> 9141.96
on a voluntary basis yeah that's the

9140.12 --> 9146.08
best

9141.96 --> 9148.839999999998
way I'm not going to charge people for

9146.08 --> 9152.8
these things yeah this what I'm learning

9148.84 --> 9152.8
is not a

9164.56 --> 9171.84
business if you could you would make

9167.319 --> 9171.84
some well good for you

9184.88 --> 9189.88
look and I'm not excluding that at some

9187.04 --> 9193.68
point I might

9189.88 --> 9195.96
be taking a lot of requests for people

9193.68 --> 9199.2
like what my healer is doing my

9195.96 --> 9202.64
healer does that he does apply the

9199.2 --> 9205.319000000001
technique he doesn't charge

9202.64 --> 9208.24
everybody it all

9205.319 --> 9209.64
depends all depends on how much money

9208.24 --> 9213.279
people

9209.64 --> 9215.278999999999
have and what their situation is like

9213.279 --> 9219.359
how they're actually

9215.279 --> 9222.04
living like he hasn't charged me almost

9219.359 --> 9224.640000000001
anything even though I'd be at certain

9222.04 --> 9227.319000000001
period I call him like multiple times a

9224.64 --> 9229.8
week cuz I was really going through a

9227.319 --> 9230.519999999999
lot of stuff and he like helped me out

9229.8 --> 9234.72
for

9230.52 --> 9239.2
free other people who are like more

9234.72 --> 9239.199999999999
wealthy he does charge per

9239.24 --> 9243.88
call I might go to something like

9246.479 --> 9253.119999999999
that but it's not just like oh pay to do

9252.0 --> 9256.359
it

9253.12 --> 9259.439
like it's a it's a gift applying the

9256.359 --> 9261.720000000001
technique is a gift it's a calling you

9259.439 --> 9264.0
should shouldn't see it as some kind of

9261.72 --> 9267.599999999999
business

9264.0 --> 9271.16
transaction that will ruin it it will

9267.6 --> 9274.720000000001
pollute the purity of it the gift that

9271.16 --> 9278.56
it is the gift to be able to do

9274.72 --> 9278.56
that a gift from

9288.64 --> 9291.64
God

9318.64 --> 9323.119999999999
for they bter system for what could re

9322.24 --> 9325.24
really

9323.12 --> 9327.92
will yeah

9325.24 --> 9329.88
eventually like if I'm just in the

9327.92 --> 9337.8
starting phases of this

9329.88 --> 9339.319
guys like I I only learned to do

9337.8 --> 9342.16
this

9339.319 --> 9345.8
like around last

9342.16 --> 9347.88
year I've only been doing it with other

9345.8 --> 9351.0
people this

9347.88 --> 9353.319
year this is all very very new to me I

9351.0 --> 9355.84
never even expected that I would be

9353.319 --> 9361.16
capable of doing it the way that I

9355.84 --> 9363.56
have just not in a hurry not in a hurry

9361.16 --> 9365.64
to try to

9363.56 --> 9369.96
overexploit new things that have

9365.64 --> 9373.92
unfolded with me yeah because I want to

9369.96 --> 9376.759999999998
keep it and keep it stable so I'm not

9373.92 --> 9381.68
overly eager to just start exploiting

9376.76 --> 9383.2
all this exploiting a oily gift which is

9381.68 --> 9388.08
what it feels

9383.2 --> 9388.08
like right I'm glad you get it Richard

9392.2 --> 9398.319000000001
G yeah and I've always been like that

9395.319 --> 9401.24
I've been like that even like

9398.319 --> 9403.72
that's even what I do here share my

9401.24 --> 9407.199999999999
ideas share my esoteric ideas and

9403.72 --> 9410.039999999999
insights and all these things like I

9407.2 --> 9415.720000000001
don't charge for that I don't have P

9410.04 --> 9419.2
play pay toplay system here with my

9415.72 --> 9420.119999999999
channel I chose that for a reason even

9419.2 --> 9422.479000000001
with the

9420.12 --> 9423.640000000001
consequences and the reason is like I

9422.479 --> 9426.479
don't want

9423.64 --> 9429.199999999999
to pollute

9426.479 --> 9432.76
things I don't want to pollute the

9429.2 --> 9435.960000000001
spiritual nature of what I

9432.76 --> 9439.279
do like I want it to be pure but in

9435.96 --> 9440.319
order for that I need to give it away

9439.279 --> 9443.52
for for

9440.319 --> 9445.96
free and then those that need it most

9443.52 --> 9449.08
and would normally not be able to afford

9445.96 --> 9452.519999999999
anything like that they can receive it

9449.08 --> 9455.16
in its purest form without any worries

9452.52 --> 9457.2
well if I'd always charge for everything

9455.16 --> 9460.039999999999
just to be able to watch my

9457.2 --> 9463.92
show then a lot of the people that need

9460.04 --> 9466.12
it the most will miss out and people

9463.92 --> 9469.68
that do then actually start paying for

9466.12 --> 9472.880000000001
it they will certainly have this default

9469.68 --> 9476.0
level of expectation building that then

9472.88 --> 9477.24
I have to live up to and that will

9476.0 --> 9481.24
actually

9477.24 --> 9482.479
disrupt my Purity in rolling out these

9481.24 --> 9488.119999999999
interesting

9482.479 --> 9490.278999999999
things so I chose to do it all for

9488.12 --> 9493.640000000001
free and

9490.279 --> 9495.76
then on top of that ask could you please

9493.64 --> 9498.439
support me for pragmatic reasons for

9495.76 --> 9500.0
practical reasons I I need the extra

9498.439 --> 9503.52
support for

9500.0 --> 9503.52
being able to eat

9504.64 --> 9510.72
properly and it has had its ups and

9508.04 --> 9514.640000000001
downs and Chaos for

9510.72 --> 9518.08
sure but at least my development in

9514.64 --> 9520.16
spiritual sector has remained pure and

9518.08 --> 9521.92
growing it's a growing curve I'm

9520.16 --> 9524.16
learning more and more I'm learning

9521.92 --> 9527.439
better and

9524.16 --> 9530.119999999999
better I'm certain that if I just

9527.439 --> 9530.92
started charging

9530.12 --> 9535.880000000001
a

9530.92 --> 9537.88
default rate for those activities that

9535.88 --> 9539.839999999998
my development would have taken another

9537.88 --> 9542.479
turn I would have probably started

9539.84 --> 9547.08
giving out really standardized

9542.479 --> 9551.519999999999
advice that would Wayne in its activity

9547.08 --> 9557.439
over time but because I haven't I keep

9551.52 --> 9557.439
developing and refining and purifying my

9558.359 --> 9563.16
insights if I had written a book about

9561.359 --> 9565.439
it yeah I made a money I would have made

9563.16 --> 9568.6
money with that but that book would have

9565.439 --> 9572.960000000001
anchored it down to a certain

9568.6 --> 9575.68
level and would have impeded my further

9572.96 --> 9578.96
developing and purification of the

9575.68 --> 9578.960000000001
things that I would have written

9580.439 --> 9587.64
about see there's reasons there's

9583.88 --> 9590.438999999998
reasons good reasons why I do things the

9587.64 --> 9592.84
way I do them and why have been doing

9590.439 --> 9596.64
them the way that I have been doing them

9592.84 --> 9598.84
for years now for almost a decade I do

9596.64 --> 9602.319
them that way for a

9598.84 --> 9605.439
reason and the reason is

9602.319 --> 9607.72
development I want to be better at it

9605.439 --> 9609.92
and I want to keep growing at

9607.72 --> 9613.0
[Music]

9609.92 --> 9616.12
it if I'd been more concerned about

9613.0 --> 9620.479
trying to get money out of it then that

9616.12 --> 9623.68
development would have gu guar guantee

9620.479 --> 9626.92
it would have been impeded because of

9623.68 --> 9629.64
that and I'm really glad that I haven't

9626.92 --> 9629.64
haven't done

9630.319 --> 9635.278999999999
that but I'm still kind of shy in

9633.479 --> 9638.319
getting support I

9635.279 --> 9642.52
mean if anybody watching this is like

9638.319 --> 9645.96
impressed or whatever or I gave you some

9642.52 --> 9649.319000000001
insight that that you feel is very

9645.96 --> 9652.16
valuable then please do if you can

9649.319 --> 9656.399
support me through the PayPal and the

9652.16 --> 9656.399
patreon I can still really use

9662.88 --> 9671.399
it and I always feel like very loved and

9668.68 --> 9675.0
appreciated when I do receive report

9671.399 --> 9675.0
support like that because it is

9675.04 --> 9680.720000000001
unconditional somebody gave it to me

9677.16 --> 9683.08
because they thought what I did was

9680.72 --> 9685.679999999998
valuable and because they wanted to give

9683.08 --> 9688.479
it they didn't need to but they wanted

9685.68 --> 9693.56
to and that just that's great it's

9688.479 --> 9693.56
fantastic to receive in that

9696.0 --> 9702.24
way it makes it more of a reward to me

9700.72 --> 9704.84
because it's not something that I can

9702.24 --> 9704.84
always count

9708.24 --> 9711.24
on

9716.76 --> 9720.359
yeah that's not going to

9720.96 --> 9727.08
work what you think you could just you

9724.8 --> 9730.759999999998
can ruin the flow of what I'm talking

9727.08 --> 9730.76
about you really think you could do

9731.0 --> 9737.76
that no no no no no that's not how that

9734.76 --> 9740.279
works I'm doing just great and I'm

9737.76 --> 9743.0
enjoying it

9740.279 --> 9745.560000000001
and you can't ruin that with your stupid

9743.0 --> 9745.56
trolling

9747.04 --> 9751.080000000002
[ __ ] oh the sun just came

9768.12 --> 9771.12
out

9771.98 --> 9775.18
[Applause]

9784.8 --> 9788.92
okay I'm going to modify the title a

9786.52 --> 9788.92
little bit

9794.16 --> 9799.399
more it's going to be one Bridge Too Far

9797.08 --> 9801.64
water purification terrain Theory and

9799.399 --> 9801.64
the

9801.68 --> 9808.64
technique cuz yeah it's been kind of a

9806.0 --> 9812.12
prominent part in the in the whole

9808.64 --> 9814.439
show so yeah I think I'm G to keep the

9812.12 --> 9817.12
title this way

9814.439 --> 9820.720000000001
though but it's been certainly a very

9817.12 --> 9824.2
Dynamic and interesting show very

9820.72 --> 9827.119999999999
different and I feel had much of a

9824.2 --> 9829.2
better flow than say the show yesterday

9827.12 --> 9830.960000000001
and the day before even those those were

9829.2 --> 9833.76
very interesting

9830.96 --> 9837.358999999999
subjects and it seem to like stumble a

9833.76 --> 9840.279
little bit I mean like dedicated

9837.359 --> 9842.880000000001
esoteric subjects like that is usually

9840.279 --> 9842.880000000001
not my

9843.16 --> 9848.279
thing I'm not really like a dedicated

9846.24 --> 9850.24
esoterics guy that's going to like tell

9848.279 --> 9853.04
you about all the numbers and Oh look

9850.24 --> 9856.359
The Hollywood movie

9853.04 --> 9859.92
connections in the dark

9856.359 --> 9863.800000000001
Plans that's not my thing

9859.92 --> 9867.56
I actually avoid that usually but I

9863.8 --> 9869.759999999998
still believe in as astrological

9867.56 --> 9872.56
esoterics and I believe that there's

9869.76 --> 9875.72
also positive things tied in with that

9872.56 --> 9879.64
that are basically getting masked and

9875.72 --> 9882.599999999999
obscured by all this negative esoteric

9879.64 --> 9884.278999999999
output that a lot of people do and a lot

9882.6 --> 9886.24
of people are obsessed with that and

9884.279 --> 9891.0
they keep following it

9886.24 --> 9895.52
around and gatria of evil and the movies

9891.0 --> 9898.0
of evil rituals and predictions and I'm

9895.52 --> 9901.24
like even if it was

9898.0 --> 9904.08
true you focusing on it is literally

9901.24 --> 9906.199999999999
giving it what it wants cu the darkness

9904.08 --> 9909.6
is then distracting you from other

9906.2 --> 9914.6
things that are not Darkness so by

9909.6 --> 9917.319
giving it it your attention it wins so

9914.6 --> 9922.640000000001
I'm not going to do that instead I'm

9917.319 --> 9922.64
going to focus on good esoteric

9923.64 --> 9929.479
things good

9926.2 --> 9929.479000000001
prophecies good

9933.12 --> 9941.399000000001
energies and I'm still still convinced

9936.92 --> 9943.16
that the whole n eclipse is significant

9941.399 --> 9947.479
in many different

9943.16 --> 9951.119999999999
ways and that a phoenix event is

9947.479 --> 9954.56
inbound it's still feeling like that

9951.12 --> 9957.720000000001
crazy things that kind of tend to build

9954.56 --> 9957.72
up to that are still

9958.0 --> 9962.439
happening numerology is interesting but

9960.16 --> 9965.279
geometria is just not

9962.439 --> 9970.0
real geometria is

9965.279 --> 9972.640000000001
correlator but to say it's not real is

9970.0 --> 9976.6
not I mean how can you say it's not real

9972.64 --> 9976.599999999999
it is there it's just

9977.92 --> 9982.399
that

9979.6 --> 9985.92
does it lead you anywhere significant

9982.399 --> 9989.358999999999
that you wouldn't have been led to

9985.92 --> 9989.359
without it you

9990.16 --> 9999.24
see are there any connections that

9995.24 --> 10002.439
geometria makes that are unique and can

9999.24 --> 10005.319
only be made through geometria or would

10002.439 --> 10007.84
you have found those connections even

10005.319 --> 10010.519999999999
without the geometria

10007.84 --> 10012.279
see

10010.52 --> 10014.76
my answer

10012.279 --> 10018.399000000001
is

10014.76 --> 10019.76
no GATRA in my personal opinion is kind

10018.399 --> 10022.96
of

10019.76 --> 10025.68
Superfluous it's a

10022.96 --> 10028.679999999998
aerification number

10025.68 --> 10032.56
ification of something that is

10028.68 --> 10032.56
basically just natural

10037.84 --> 10040.84
patterns

10041.52 --> 10047.92
yeah exactly that that is true that is

10044.359 --> 10051.800000000001
exactly true about it and that's why

10047.92 --> 10051.8
gatria is kind of like

10051.84 --> 10058.72
a a side

10054.479 --> 10061.76
thing I've never really held on to

10058.72 --> 10063.56
geometria as something really important

10061.76 --> 10066.439
or

10063.56 --> 10073.96
significant and I think

10066.439 --> 10076.399
that like UL s play with gatria and feed

10073.96 --> 10080.278999999999
people that on

10076.399 --> 10083.0
purpose it's the people that plan these

10080.279 --> 10087.12
things that make

10083.0 --> 10090.16
gatria significant on purpose they feed

10087.12 --> 10095.240000000002
into it they feed the belief that jatra

10090.16 --> 10095.24
is like a a significant important

10097.72 --> 10104.92
thing but I think that like actual

10101.72 --> 10107.479
astrology and astr astrological

10104.92 --> 10110.2
knowledge and the timing of the

10107.479 --> 10113.0
astrology is the actual significant

10110.2 --> 10115.800000000001
thing and not

10113.0 --> 10118.0
gatria gatria is more like a side effect

10115.8 --> 10118.0
to

10127.72 --> 10130.72
me

10137.2 --> 10144.279
right anyway hope everybody is enjoying

10140.12 --> 10146.68
this wildly varying show if if it is

10144.279 --> 10151.24
then please don't forget to Rogan it

10146.68 --> 10151.24
up probably going to round out not to

10152.2 --> 10156.720000000001
soon but uh yeah it's been

10156.92 --> 10163.92
interesting Rogan's it up and yeah if

10160.68 --> 10166.76
anybody could support me for the PayPal

10163.92 --> 10169.439
would be fantastic I can still use it I

10166.76 --> 10172.64
mean I'm still technically broke in this

10169.439 --> 10174.52
moment so it would be again very

10172.64 --> 10176.56
appreciated if somebody could support me

10174.52 --> 10178.479000000001
I got some support yesterday which is

10176.56 --> 10181.84
why I have

10178.479 --> 10186.96
food but any more would be

10181.84 --> 10186.960000000001
fantastic so anybody that could spare

10187.64 --> 10195.0
something please send it to my

10191.2 --> 10195.0
PayPal that would be

10198.68 --> 10203.52
great and if you can't don't worry about

10206.64 --> 10210.64
it I can

10212.319 --> 10220.6
survive it's just that yeah i' prefer to

10217.64 --> 10223.039999999999
uh to get a little Surplus so I could

10220.6 --> 10224.880000000001
stock up on certain things and not just

10223.04 --> 10227.52
like try to get by with the minimum

10224.88 --> 10229.399
which is unfortunately the situation

10227.52 --> 10234.12
I'm I'm

10229.399 --> 10237.76
in like probably for the rest of the

10234.12 --> 10241.08
month I'm just happy that I at least got

10237.76 --> 10241.08
some dinner and all

10241.12 --> 10247.720000000001
that looked up rains yeah I don't know

10244.68 --> 10252.399
what the [ __ ] rain is somebody sent me

10247.72 --> 10252.399
something like that

10254.68 --> 10260.319
uh I don't know what it is I don't have

10257.76 --> 10263.800000000001
any associations with it I just say

10260.319 --> 10268.399
rogun not with an i in it

10263.8 --> 10273.64
rogans as in Joe Rogan the human thumb

10268.399 --> 10276.84
that's why it's a Rogan yeah Rogan a

10273.64 --> 10280.519999999999
thumb not R gains whatever the hell

10276.84 --> 10280.52
that's supposed to be

10281.479 --> 10289.119999999999
okay so that's cute I have no

10285.96 --> 10289.119999999999
association with that

10291.88 --> 10301.08
whatsoever and I'm not going

10295.52 --> 10301.08
to so leave me out of your row gains or

gains you got

10537.479 --> 10541.64

10596.2 --> 10601.439
can or giv a Rogan's n it's rogans with

10600.72 --> 10605.438999999998
an

10601.439 --> 10608.479000000001
S A Rogan up is

10605.439 --> 10610.6
weird whatever it's just my Joke Man

10608.479 --> 10613.119999999999
it's not even my joke really it's om

10610.6 --> 10617.2
Benjamin's

10613.12 --> 10617.2
joke it's just I thought it

10619.68 --> 10624.56
funny if you want to say thumb up

10622.279 --> 10627.16
instead that's fine I like to say

10624.56 --> 10627.16
Rogan's

10637.16 --> 10640.16
up

10648.72 --> 10653.08
right

10650.04 --> 10655.359
anyhow I'm going to round out the show

10653.08 --> 10659.399
going almost 3 hours or a little over 3

10655.359 --> 10662.92
hours it all depends because OBS always

10659.399 --> 10665.68
or YouTube always adds more time to it

10662.92 --> 10667.12
which is kind of weird it's almost like

10665.68 --> 10672.76
YouTube

10667.12 --> 10672.76
like slows it down by

10674.04 --> 10677.960000000001
0.02% or

10675.92 --> 10681.52
something there's always a little bit

10677.96 --> 10683.08
extra time added to the OBS counter

10681.52 --> 10683.880000000001
which is kind of odd and I always try to

10683.08 --> 10687.039999999999
time

10683.88 --> 10691.56
it see what what comes

10687.04 --> 10693.6
out right so anyway thanks everyone for

10691.56 --> 10695.16

10693.6 --> 10698.239
