128.56 --> 131.36
little birds

131.84 --> 138.4
singing in the in the early morning

136.08 --> 140.4
they're all very happy it was finally

138.4 --> 144.8
dying down

140.4 --> 144.8
but yeah fireworks have been going on

145.28 --> 149.599
especially like those really heavy

147.68 --> 151.59900000000002
mortars and all that

149.599 --> 154.64
the awesome ones that i showed

151.599 --> 157.67999999999998
they kept on going to

154.64 --> 159.67999999999998
like 2 30.

157.68 --> 163.84
although overall

159.68 --> 165.92000000000002
much less fireworks that light

163.84 --> 170.68
anyway yeah i hope you all enjoyed the

saturday

181.68 --> 184.68

186.72 --> 191.599
so don't expect a whole bunch of people

188.959 --> 194.959
to be up really early right now

191.599 --> 194.959
in the united states that is

197.36 --> 200.8
there's nobody in chat yet

but they will come

206.879 --> 210.48
huh

208.4 --> 213.48000000000002
anyway

210.48 --> 213.48
uh

221.68 --> 227.28
did stay up pretty late

224.799 --> 229.28
but yeah it's to be expected

227.28 --> 231.92
and yeah that

229.28 --> 231.92
feel fine

236.72 --> 241.84
hey adam meekin good morning first chat

241.92 --> 244.95899999999997
happy new year indeed

247.76 --> 252.48
right i haven't like gone out for

250.0 --> 255.2
groceries yet but that's also because

252.48 --> 256.959
well store opens at 1. i'm surprised

255.2 --> 259.44
there was even a store that the

256.959 --> 262.16
supermarket organic one was even open

259.44 --> 264.4
january 1st

262.16 --> 266.88000000000005
normally everything is closed

264.4 --> 268.479
but yeah i asked and they were open so

266.88 --> 272.24
but i haven't gone yet

268.479 --> 276.56
to basically make my rounds see

272.24 --> 276.56
what has been blown up or if anything

276.639 --> 279.44
but

278.0 --> 283.84
yeah from this

279.44 --> 283.84
viewpoint everything seems just fine

284.639 --> 287.919
hey seeking star water

290.32 --> 294.68
one glass of spiked eggnog

301.919 --> 306.639
so you're up early right all right well

304.4 --> 310.08
good morning see that water

306.639 --> 313.08
glad to have you here

310.08 --> 313.08
hmm

327.84 --> 332.479
oh yeah it's apparently the anniversary

330.56 --> 334.96
well at least according to mitchell's

332.479 --> 337.039
uploaded video it's the anniversary of

334.96 --> 339.84
the second anniversary

337.039 --> 339.84
of the black swan

341.039 --> 344.88
which was released on january 1st

344.96 --> 350.15999999999997
2020 apparently

348.16 --> 352.47900000000004
i wasn't even

350.16 --> 356.03900000000004
fully aware it was like that precise a

352.479 --> 356.039
date but sure

370.0 --> 373.0
hmm

386.479 --> 390.24
i yeah i was kind of like looking around

389.12 --> 392.56
a bit

390.24 --> 395.6
because it's weird

392.56 --> 396.8
like in my hey mike sidonich

395.6 --> 398.8
in my

396.8 --> 403.28000000000003
typical experience of

398.8 --> 408.0
like the la yeah the new year's eve

403.28 --> 411.039
there's always like some kind of uh

408.0 --> 413.36
comedy stand-up thing going on

411.039 --> 415.84
because that and that because yeah

413.36 --> 417.44
that's a dutch thing i think

415.84 --> 420.4
and then everybody watched it pretty

417.44 --> 422.71999999999997
much right before new year's eve starts

420.4 --> 425.039
the fireworks starts

422.72 --> 426.8
so i just took a look because

425.039 --> 429.84
well i haven't seen anything that was

426.8 --> 432.56
like really like yeah that's awesome or

429.84 --> 434.479
as so i thought

432.56 --> 437.28000000000003
at the time

434.479 --> 440.08
in like 10 years

437.28 --> 442.79999999999995
every time now i'm just annoyed by it

440.08 --> 445.599
yet general annoyed by most things that

442.8 --> 447.199
come out of dutch television like that

445.599 --> 449.12
trying to be funny

447.199 --> 451.52000000000004
well this year they had just some guy i

449.12 --> 453.28000000000003
don't even know who that was

451.52 --> 455.19899999999996
i just tuned in for a couple of seconds

453.28 --> 456.63899999999995
see what they had to say

455.199 --> 458.24
and it was like

456.639 --> 461.12
well

458.24 --> 464.08
with all the craziness going on

461.12 --> 465.759
no wonder there are all these conspiracy

464.08 --> 467.52
theorists out there

465.759 --> 470.24
and that was pretty much the entire

467.52 --> 470.24
running joke

471.12 --> 473.84000000000003
like still

473.919 --> 477.44
not straightforward

476.0 --> 479.44
still like oh

477.44 --> 481.759
well there might be something wrong oh

479.44 --> 482.879
there's so many mistakes so surprising

481.759 --> 485.36
how

482.879 --> 487.84000000000003
conspiracy theorists think there's

485.36 --> 492.16
something wrong

487.84 --> 493.919
kind of super annoying but yeah

492.16 --> 496.0
so i sampled that

493.919 --> 498.4
for like two minutes and then i was done

496.0 --> 498.4
with that

499.84 --> 502.87899999999996
hey elise g

501.28 --> 506.44
happy new year

502.879 --> 506.44
good to see you

525.68 --> 528.16
oh

526.56 --> 531.1199999999999
yeah that must be beautiful so you can

528.16 --> 533.68
start water like all the fireworks

531.12 --> 536.9590000000001
all the light reflecting of the snow

533.68 --> 536.959
yeah that must be amazing

544.64 --> 550.08
cools

546.0 --> 550.08
yeah minus 10 in the morning that's cold

555.6 --> 559.839
they really go all out with the

557.36 --> 563.48
fireworks over there don't they you mean

559.839 --> 563.48
over here elisha

565.6 --> 568.0
i mean

568.16 --> 573.8
by dutch standards yesterday was really

570.8 --> 573.8
modest

576.72 --> 580.8000000000001
but yeah there were just a couple of

578.8 --> 583.04
guys that take it

580.8 --> 586.3199999999999
that really kept the high

583.04 --> 588.7199999999999
quality fireworks going

586.32 --> 590.6400000000001
like they really make the fireworks for

588.72 --> 593.279
everybody

590.64 --> 593.279
i love that

595.12 --> 598.8
but yeah you should have seen like

599.04 --> 602.1999999999999
the fireworks around

601.2 --> 604.72
like

602.2 --> 608.6400000000001
2010 and all that

604.72 --> 609.839
now those were some like crazy fireworks

608.64 --> 611.4399999999999
but then

609.839 --> 613.6800000000001
as i said

611.44 --> 615.6
you just get to see a lot of smokes and

613.68 --> 618.16
flashes coming through it and just

615.6 --> 618.16
endless

618.88 --> 623.519
just never stops

621.519 --> 625.44
so you don't even get to really see all

623.519 --> 627.36
that fireworks it's just too much smoke

625.44 --> 629.519
everywhere

627.36 --> 631.519
like it's been that crazy this year it

629.519 --> 635.8
wasn't that bad and so you could

631.519 --> 635.8
actually keep seeing it

647.12 --> 650.0
right

648.0 --> 650.959
but yeah there's there's plenty of fight

650.0 --> 652.959
because

650.959 --> 656.7199999999999
it's always been dutch tradition not to

652.959 --> 658.8
just have some centralized firework or

656.72 --> 661.2
some organized firework display

658.8 --> 662.7199999999999
somewhere in the city although there's

661.2 --> 665.12
there's still that

662.72 --> 667.36
still that's still being done

665.12 --> 669.839
but here well there used to be just

667.36 --> 672.839
fireworks being sold like three days

669.839 --> 675.0400000000001
ahead of new year's

672.839 --> 677.0400000000001
eve and that's why we have like

675.04 --> 679.04
everybody like

677.04 --> 681.279
a lot of kids walking around with

679.04 --> 682.56
fireworks

681.279 --> 684.399
throughout

682.56 --> 686.56
a long period of time especially the

684.399 --> 688.399
last three days and then

686.56 --> 691.3599999999999
everybody brings out

688.399 --> 691.36
like the mortars

693.2 --> 696.399
yeah everything in new year's eve so

695.279 --> 698.48
that's

696.399 --> 701.72
it's a dutch tradition and i really like

698.48 --> 701.72
that tradition

704.8 --> 709.4799999999999
yeah animals don't like it though

723.12 --> 728.8
although i don't know i think that

725.76 --> 731.36
dutch animals in general by now because

728.8 --> 734.7199999999999
this tradition has been so long

731.36 --> 736.8000000000001
like they just know what's gonna happen

734.72 --> 739.9200000000001
because hey in the morning what was it

736.8 --> 744.079
like four or five o'clock or something i

739.92 --> 744.079
heard just a little bird was just here

744.56 --> 750.079
even while there was still some banging

746.399 --> 751.519
going on here and there in the distance

750.079 --> 753.4399999999999
so

751.519 --> 756.32
i think they

753.44 --> 758.72
are either used to like okay during this

756.32 --> 760.9590000000001
time of year it's like a war the humans

758.72 --> 762.8000000000001
have this weird war where they blow up

760.959 --> 765.04
everything

762.8 --> 768.399
and then it stops

765.04 --> 770.24
so the super shock sensitive birds they

768.399 --> 772.24
all survived through it because those

770.24 --> 774.32
that didn't just died of heart attacks

772.24 --> 777.44
so

774.32 --> 777.44
like ages ago

777.6 --> 782.48
right but yeah you don't see any like

780.079 --> 785.4799999999999
dead birds lying around or something at

782.48 --> 785.48
least

790.24 --> 793.44
right

791.12 --> 795.2
but it must be a rough night

793.44 --> 798.0
for a lot of them

795.2 --> 799.6800000000001
i wonder if they like have certain spots

798.0 --> 800.959
in the middle of the forest whether they

799.68 --> 803.92
know

800.959 --> 806.2399999999999
or whether fireworks just

803.92 --> 806.24
don't

806.48 --> 812.24
disrupt them as much and they just all

808.32 --> 812.24
migrate there for the night or something

812.959 --> 816.6389999999999
i don't know how to do it

815.04 --> 818.079
but there seems to be plenty of birds

816.639 --> 821.32
around

818.079 --> 821.3199999999999
right now

833.92 --> 838.16
oh

836.16 --> 841.16
oh i'm taking star wars that sounds

838.16 --> 841.16
amazing

842.32 --> 848.0
fresh fish from the lake right next to

844.88 --> 848.0
you yeah that's awesome

854.32 --> 857.32
ah

870.079 --> 874.2399999999999
the mountain the noise echoes like

871.92 --> 877.24
gunshots

874.24 --> 877.24
right

896.0 --> 900.48
bunch of bats flying around the area

898.079 --> 902.16
just before fireworks well what is very

900.48 --> 905.279
typical here

902.16 --> 906.959
is that we hear like what is it i think

905.279 --> 908.24
gooses

906.959 --> 911.5999999999999
migrating

908.24 --> 911.6
like they all fly away

911.76 --> 916.399
the days before

913.92 --> 918.87
so you can't you usually don't even see

916.399 --> 921.279
them above the clouds but they go

918.87 --> 924.079
[Music]

921.279 --> 927.12
and the fly away through the v formation

924.079 --> 929.5999999999999
and all that

927.12 --> 932.48
so there are definitely animals that are

929.6 --> 932.48
taking the cue

932.56 --> 936.92
to get out here at least temporary

949.92 --> 955.519
yeah and there's bats here too but i

951.839 --> 957.759
haven't seen them

955.519 --> 957.759
in

958.24 --> 962.24
in probably like a month at least

964.0 --> 968.759
i think they're all hibernating right

965.759 --> 968.759
now

974.93 --> 980.1999999999999
[Music]

1014.079 --> 1018.88
yeah but in general fireworks is a big

1016.48 --> 1021.6
hazard for bats because bats

1018.88 --> 1023.4399999999999
are not high flyers they fly low so

1021.6 --> 1025.3600000000001
there's going to be mortars exploding

1023.44 --> 1027.839
that's like a serious

1025.36 --> 1030.24
serious life-threatening hazard

1027.839 --> 1032.48
to those creatures

1030.24 --> 1032.48
yeah

1034.16 --> 1038.64
and they know it

1036.72 --> 1042.3600000000001
right hey tony whitcomb

1038.64 --> 1042.3600000000001
yeah happy new year

1056.799 --> 1061.36
smoke stacks in tone huh all right

1062.08 --> 1065.3999999999999
that's cool

1075.039 --> 1078.8799999999999
so they're using the smokestack like an

1077.28 --> 1083.16
artificial

1078.88 --> 1083.16
cave huh

1090.28 --> 1093.349
[Music]

1096.07 --> 1104.6789999999999
[Music]

1101.679 --> 1104.679
hmm

1120.88 --> 1123.8400000000001
hmm

1134.24 --> 1137.24
right

1137.44 --> 1141.8400000000001
anyway i'm glad we all made it through

1141.12 --> 1144.84
to

1141.84 --> 1144.84
2022

1145.919 --> 1149.3200000000002
there's the monks

1150.0 --> 1155.44
what is the monks

1152.559 --> 1155.44
making their round

1160.16 --> 1164.28
lots of people taking walks

1169.919 --> 1172.919
hmm

1183.84 --> 1186.84
so

1194.799 --> 1200.4
all right

1196.96 --> 1200.4
so yeah new year

1200.48 --> 1204.72
new themes new opportunities

1205.12 --> 1208.08
i wonder what the flat earth debate is

1207.039 --> 1210.1589999999999
going to be

1208.08 --> 1212.32
aiming at this time

1210.159 --> 1214.7990000000002
i thought there was like an idea to make

1212.32 --> 1217.28
it like the year like the black swan

1214.799 --> 1218.84
years 2020

1217.28 --> 1221.6
sexton

1218.84 --> 1223.36
2021 then is this year gonna be the year

1221.6 --> 1226.1589999999999
of the sun there's certainly a lot of

1223.36 --> 1227.84
data concerning it

1226.159 --> 1232.159
holographic nature i've been talking

1227.84 --> 1232.1589999999999
about it a lot it's basically one of

1232.84 --> 1239.6789999999999
my entry concepts

1236.08 --> 1239.6789999999999
as a flat earther on youtube

1243.76 --> 1246.64
but yeah i wonder what we can even do

1245.36 --> 1250.24
with it right

1246.64 --> 1250.24
of course in the flat earth debates

1250.72 --> 1256.08
it's always measured as in like how can

1253.919 --> 1256.0800000000002
we

1256.32 --> 1261.52
use it to

1258.4 --> 1265.2
disprove the ball earth

1261.52 --> 1265.2
or the ball earth cosmology

1265.44 --> 1270.24
i don't know if you can really use the

1267.44 --> 1274.72
holographic sun for that but we can

1270.24 --> 1278.799
definitely disprove how it is not this

1274.72 --> 1282.24
giant fiery ball 93 million miles away

1278.799 --> 1285.28
shining parallel light towards us

1282.24 --> 1287.36
right we already know how to do that

1285.28 --> 1289.52
but maybe there's even more data that'll

1287.36 --> 1292.1589999999999
come out of that

1289.52 --> 1293.52
has been scraped together and

1292.159 --> 1295.2
finding

1293.52 --> 1297.44
a critical mass

1295.2 --> 1301.2
to do that i don't know it hasn't really

1297.44 --> 1301.2
been talked about like even

1302.24 --> 1305.84
in the back chats

1311.12 --> 1316.6399999999999
reflection of the sun on water directly

1313.6 --> 1318.48
to your feet is a great flat earth proof

1316.64 --> 1320.7990000000002
well yeah

1318.48 --> 1320.799
yeah

1321.36 --> 1323.9189999999999
definitely

1329.28 --> 1334.6399999999999
fight the letter

1330.84 --> 1337.6
this he's a subject matter expert on sex

1334.64 --> 1340.5590000000002
and so oh my god

1337.6 --> 1340.559
what a joker

1340.799 --> 1346.84
launch a counter-attack oh oh yeah

1343.84 --> 1346.84
just

1347.28 --> 1351.84
i mean we've been talking about it for

1349.28 --> 1354.559
like a year

1351.84 --> 1355.4399999999998
so he needed to wait until the new year

1354.559 --> 1358.3999999999999
to

1355.44 --> 1361.039
go there that's just silly

1358.4 --> 1364.72
anyway hello classical homeopath happy

1361.039 --> 1364.72
new year to you good to see you in chat

1370.23 --> 1374.6
[Music]

1371.36 --> 1374.6

what

1388.24 --> 1392.72
oh damn tony whitcomb that sucks

1395.52 --> 1399.039
i was a little late reading that

1399.36 --> 1402.36
man

1408.96 --> 1412.919
how the hell did that happen

1417.679 --> 1421.679
what the who's gonna do that on

1419.36 --> 1424.6789999999999
christmas eve what's this

1421.679 --> 1424.679
maniacal

1443.12 --> 1445.84
oh jesus

1468.88 --> 1473.8400000000001
because he wants to protect it really

1471.12 --> 1473.84
what

1485.2 --> 1489.8400000000001
but

1487.52 --> 1492.48
like do you have any knowledge as to who

1489.84 --> 1496.3999999999999
did that and why

1492.48 --> 1499.4
tony whitcomb this sounds pretty

1496.4 --> 1499.4
up

1510.88 --> 1515.8400000000001
what's the poop chaps this is

1526.559 --> 1529.559
what

1531.52 --> 1534.08
the sun

1538.4 --> 1540.5590000000002
but

1541.52 --> 1546.1589999999999
like why

1543.679 --> 1549.52
i mean does he have like a history of

1546.159 --> 1549.5200000000002
violence to him

1550.72 --> 1554.64
like is he

1552.0 --> 1557.279
easily angered like what yeah this is

1554.64 --> 1559.5200000000002
like a lot of data without with very

1557.279 --> 1561.039
little context there that sounds crazy

1559.52 --> 1563.36
like

1561.039 --> 1563.36
damn

1564.0 --> 1570.919
beating up your own

1566.0 --> 1570.919
family members that's what the

1584.88 --> 1587.44
yeah

1585.919 --> 1590.24
george sanford

1587.44 --> 1590.24
i don't know man

1592.24 --> 1598.0
it could be

1594.559 --> 1601.24
don't know no nothing about the guy wow

1598.0 --> 1601.24
all right

1615.6 --> 1619.12
well i don't know maybe you should know

1617.6 --> 1621.4399999999998
a little

1619.12 --> 1623.6789999999999
since he well basically beat your

1621.44 --> 1626.4
brother in the hospital

1623.679 --> 1627.6000000000001
that's kind of somebody you have to like

1626.4 --> 1631.4
know

1627.6 --> 1631.3999999999999
what they're up to

1644.72 --> 1648.799
not putting assumptions in the mix okay

1646.48 --> 1652.44
yeah that well that's wise at least but

1648.799 --> 1652.44
still jeez

1692.08 --> 1695.08
man

1696.38 --> 1699.499
[Music]

1704.799 --> 1707.799
uh

1730.799 --> 1735.52
right well if you know very little about

1733.039 --> 1739.84
it then yeah it's no use really

1735.52 --> 1739.84
starting a conversation about it

1742.799 --> 1749.48
phone is on a constant loop

1746.48 --> 1749.48
what

1760.48 --> 1763.76
okay what then

1762.32 --> 1765.84
wha whoa

1763.76 --> 1769.44
well how are you even

1765.84 --> 1769.4399999999998
in my chat right now then

1777.6 --> 1781.1589999999999
firmware problem

1804.48 --> 1809.84
cody box

1806.399 --> 1809.84
i don't know what that is

1834.159 --> 1841.279
like a fire stick what

1836.72 --> 1841.279
i have no idea what you're talking about

1849.279 --> 1853.039
fire stick is that some sort of computer

1851.6 --> 1855.12
i did

1853.039 --> 1857.279
no idea at this point

1855.12 --> 1860.799
but fine

1857.279 --> 1860.799
having some hardware issues

1861.6 --> 1865.76
right yeah i hope you'll work it out as

1864.0 --> 1868.08
quick as you can oh

1865.76 --> 1868.08
son

1868.399 --> 1871.12
ah

1869.2 --> 1873.3600000000001

1871.12 --> 1873.36
huh

1874.08 --> 1877.08
nice

1893.12 --> 1896.12
hmm

1916.559 --> 1921.36
apps on a media center

1919.36 --> 1922.4799999999998
okay so you're like doing it through

1921.36 --> 1925.1999999999998
your

1922.48 --> 1928.2
tv computer thing

1925.2 --> 1928.2
okay

1960.399 --> 1963.399
this

1966.24 --> 1969.84
looks

1967.279 --> 1973.0
like it does in birmingham england

1969.84 --> 1973.0
all right

1976.559 --> 1981.6789999999999
that looks like a really pleasant sun

1979.2 --> 1983.44
i hope it's still going to be there out

1981.679 --> 1986.0
behind from behind the clouds when i go

1983.44 --> 1987.3600000000001
for groceries later

1986.0 --> 1991.0
i could really

1987.36 --> 1991.0
use some of that

1998.96 --> 2005.8400000000001
i do feel good though

2001.44 --> 2008.24
i was kind of surprised about how

2005.84 --> 2010.799
good i felt even yesterday when i did

2008.24 --> 2011.919
the new year's stream like the the year

2010.799 --> 2014.08
before

2011.919 --> 2017.039
if i remember correctly

2014.08 --> 2019.1999999999998
it's like a lot of nerves

2017.039 --> 2021.76
right almost like christmas nerves

2019.2 --> 2023.2
there's always but yesterday i felt like

2021.76 --> 2027.679
really

2023.2 --> 2031.039
almost euphorically relieved of all that

2027.679 --> 2034.0800000000002
it was really awesome

2031.039 --> 2037.12
i i really had a great night last night

2034.08 --> 2037.12
because i just felt

2037.84 --> 2040.9599999999998
no stress

2043.2 --> 2048.96
no not the pressure of it anyway

2047.44 --> 2051.839
nothing

2048.96 --> 2055.28
wearing down on me

2051.839 --> 2058.0
and i still kind of feel like that a bit

2055.28 --> 2058.0
very easy

2058.24 --> 2061.6389999999997
easy going

2068.0 --> 2071.679
i think i might also have something to

2069.599 --> 2075.0
do with that i just really ate

2071.679 --> 2075.0
well yesterday

2078.32 --> 2082.0
yeah i had like a

2083.76 --> 2088.3990000000003
pizza

2086.32 --> 2091.9190000000003
then i had chicken broccoli

2088.399 --> 2091.919
it's best decision ever

2092.56 --> 2098.0789999999997
oh i love it

2094.56 --> 2100.0789999999997
like a lot of butter rosemary pepper and

2098.079 --> 2102.2400000000002
salt

2100.079 --> 2104.6400000000003
broccoli sticks separately and then the

2102.24 --> 2108.56
chicken just oh so good

2104.64 --> 2108.56
so nourishing i really needed that

2109.839 --> 2114.24
and i ate it early too that's good like

2112.64 --> 2115.2799999999997
i need to just

2114.24 --> 2120.0789999999997
get

2115.28 --> 2120.079
my my food sorted better just

2120.32 --> 2124.96
eat more in time that's that's like one

2123.28 --> 2127.52
objective i'm

2124.96 --> 2129.68
calling for myself this year i really

2127.52 --> 2132.56
need to time

2129.68 --> 2134.3999999999996
my food better because it works so much

2132.56 --> 2136.96
more

2134.4 --> 2139.359
in my favor when i do it

2136.96 --> 2139.359
i think

2142.079 --> 2149.599
anyway and then i had the only bolden

2145.28 --> 2149.599
like the the baked things with

2151.839 --> 2156.88
resins in it i loved it

2154.8 --> 2159.44
five of them i ate them all

2156.88 --> 2161.2000000000003
throughout the night

2159.44 --> 2162.8
they weren't even like too sweet or

2161.2 --> 2164.24
anything

2162.8 --> 2167.599
they were great

2164.24 --> 2167.5989999999997
so yeah i had plenty to eat

2167.839 --> 2171.96
and i feel good this morning

2184.24 --> 2188.64
yeah yeah katana would really man good

2186.4 --> 2188.64
luck

2190.24 --> 2193.359
with your uh with your bro with your

2192.32 --> 2196.32
brother

2193.359 --> 2198.3199999999997
i hope he recovers

2196.32 --> 2201.44
without yeah

2198.32 --> 2203.44
too many issues

2201.44 --> 2205.28
but it's you got to tell us though at

2203.44 --> 2207.599
some point like what the hell really

2205.28 --> 2210.7200000000003
happened

2207.599 --> 2210.7200000000003
because that's just like

2211.76 --> 2216.2400000000002
yeah too extreme to just leave it like

2213.92 --> 2216.2400000000002
that

2218.079 --> 2221.32
all right

2229.04 --> 2232.04
anyway

2242.88 --> 2248.1600000000003
how is everything

2245.28 --> 2248.1600000000003
everybody

2251.52 --> 2256.44
classical homeopath george sanford

2259.599 --> 2266.119
elise g

2261.76 --> 2266.119
how was your new year's eve

2282.839 --> 2292.0789999999997
oh that sounds nice too tony whitman

2287.76 --> 2292.079
yeah i actually got some micro steaks

2292.16 --> 2297.04
just smaller steaks again because last

2294.4 --> 2299.839
time that was really enjoyable

2297.04 --> 2299.839
with green beans

2300.32 --> 2304.88
yeah i think they're green beans just

2302.88 --> 2306.6400000000003
beans

2304.88 --> 2308.1600000000003
and yeah

2306.64 --> 2310.8799999999997
some good

2308.16 --> 2313.5989999999997
freshly made garlic sauce with that

2310.88 --> 2316.48
mayonnaise garlic

2313.599 --> 2320.0
some herbs yeah that's gonna be great

2316.48 --> 2320.0
looking forward to getting that

2320.72 --> 2326.2
i mean i making that i already have it

2322.96 --> 2326.2
in the fridge

2329.359 --> 2331.68
ah

2333.359 --> 2340.68
hey flat record music

2336.24 --> 2340.68
it's been a while good to see you

2345.359 --> 2349.7599999999998
you usually only catch me on the way to

2347.44 --> 2349.76
bed

2350.64 --> 2355.64
okay

2352.16 --> 2355.64
are you in australia

2359.4 --> 2363.52
microstates what's that

2364.0 --> 2369.44
uh

2365.839 --> 2372.16
you mean like in thermodynamics talk

2369.44 --> 2374.8
available microstates

2372.16 --> 2375.68
it has to do with entropy

2374.8 --> 2378.48
it's

2375.68 --> 2381.48
super like hyper conceptual

2378.48 --> 2381.48
mathematical

2387.04 --> 2392.0
i don't know i didn't bring that up but

2389.52 --> 2394.72
yeah oh i'll tell you

2392.0 --> 2394.72
if you want to know

2394.8 --> 2399.599
california

2397.44 --> 2402.2400000000002

really late

2404.319 --> 2410.2799999999997
and then you catch the early roadshow

2407.119 --> 2410.28
all right

2422.72 --> 2426.3999999999996
oh i said micro stakes yeah

2427.68 --> 2431.839
now i wasn't talking about

2429.76 --> 2432.88
like physics now i was talking about

2431.839 --> 2435.2799999999997
stakes

2432.88 --> 2437.52
very small ones like

2435.28 --> 2441.3590000000004
yeah and it's not even expensive like a

2437.52 --> 2444.4
big slab steak oh big

2441.359 --> 2445.68
for me everything is big i eat small

2444.4 --> 2449.52
i eat like a

2445.68 --> 2449.52
chinese woman or something i don't know

2451.359 --> 2455.5989999999997
sufficient you know that's the most

2453.359 --> 2456.7999999999997
important part it makes it everything

2455.599 --> 2458.079
cheaper

2456.8 --> 2461.04
but

2458.079 --> 2464.0
yeah normally a big steak is like

2461.04 --> 2466.0
eight to ten euros right

2464.0 --> 2467.92
over this it's like a whole bunch of

2466.0 --> 2470.72
small ones

2467.92 --> 2472.8
and it's only five euros and it's plenty

2470.72 --> 2474.8799999999997
it's like really plenty

2472.8 --> 2476.4
and i would probably cut it up in

2474.88 --> 2478.2400000000002
smaller

2476.4 --> 2480.64
steak as well

2478.24 --> 2482.9599999999996
because i don't really like like huge

2480.64 --> 2484.7999999999997
slabs of meat like that i like them kind

2482.96 --> 2487.839
of thin

2484.8 --> 2487.8390000000004
just quickly

2488.8 --> 2491.92
prepared

2490.16 --> 2493.68
if they're thin

2491.92 --> 2494.7200000000003
like you have to

2493.68 --> 2496.96
cook them

2494.72 --> 2498.64
less long anyway

2496.96 --> 2500.079
it's all better like that

2498.64 --> 2501.92
in my opinion

2500.079 --> 2504.48
and then that way you can soak it up

2501.92 --> 2504.48
with all the

2504.88 --> 2510.8
salt and pepper

2508.079 --> 2513.88
much better yeah anyway looking forward

2510.8 --> 2513.88
to that

2522.4 --> 2528.0
it says he is waiting for flat earth

2524.72 --> 2530.319
just to get out of there

2528.0 --> 2532.56
fight the flat earth seems to be kind of

2530.319 --> 2535.8
late a year

2532.56 --> 2535.7999999999997
it's ridiculous

2537.119 --> 2542.079
waiting for flutters to get out there in

2539.2 --> 2544.24
what's already out there

2542.079 --> 2546.96
so is he now going to be like oh i'm the

2544.24 --> 2549.839
expert at sections

2546.96 --> 2551.52
oh nobody's

2549.839 --> 2554.319
sharing and the flat earthers are not

2551.52 --> 2556.72
sharing information about it

2554.319 --> 2559.2
so i'm just waiting for them to respond

2556.72 --> 2560.319
why is nobody responding like yeah

2559.2 --> 2563.04
because

2560.319 --> 2566.96
it's already out

2563.04 --> 2566.96
like it's already been shared

2569.839 --> 2573.92
fight flat earth will lose he has

2572.64 --> 2575.52
nothing yeah

2573.92 --> 2576.839
no of course he doesn't have anything

2575.52 --> 2578.56
they just have

2576.839 --> 2581.04
delusions and

2578.56 --> 2583.359
quick red herring in a way

2581.04 --> 2583.359
you know

2588.48 --> 2592.88
or like hide in terrestrial refraction

2590.64 --> 2595.2
is this is what ball wins on right

2592.88 --> 2596.079
because that's what's yeah what's left

2595.2 --> 2597.52
here

2596.079 --> 2600.319
yeah but as soon as you do that you

2597.52 --> 2603.52
don't have r value anymore which you use

2600.319 --> 2605.44
in a lot of things

2603.52 --> 2606.88
so it's it's going to be a dead end

2605.44 --> 2608.7200000000003
always

2606.88 --> 2612.2400000000002
but yeah you can think like oh yeah but

2608.72 --> 2614.16
you only need an optically flat plane

2612.24 --> 2616.0789999999997
for the optical

2614.16 --> 2618.24
geometric instrument

2616.079 --> 2620.6400000000003
and terrestrial refraction just so

2618.24 --> 2621.5989999999997
happens to make it look just like a flat

2620.64 --> 2624.56
plane

2621.599 --> 2627.04
so it works just fine

2624.56 --> 2629.839
like oh so terrestrial fraction well how

2627.04 --> 2633.04
did you get the r value

2629.839 --> 2635.68
that you use in terrestrial refraction

2633.04 --> 2639.7599999999998
i mean wasn't that derived from the

2635.68 --> 2639.7599999999998
horizon being geometric

2640.319 --> 2643.839
uh

2641.599 --> 2643.839
yeah

2644.8 --> 2650.6400000000003
so yeah this train of thinking

2648.24 --> 2650.64
has been

2651.119 --> 2656.48
very

2652.16 --> 2659.2
fully developed for over a year right

2656.48 --> 2662.599
i mean the arwanian paradox is from when

2659.2 --> 2662.5989999999997
was it 2020

2664.72 --> 2670.7999999999997
i figured it out in the summer of 2020

2667.76 --> 2672.5600000000004
it's been named after it like

2670.8 --> 2676.0
yeah

2672.56 --> 2678.48
oh oh you don't like it

2676.0 --> 2680.64
because there's literally nothing you

2678.48 --> 2682.96
can do

2680.64 --> 2685.92
to like salvage your position from that

2682.96 --> 2689.319
point on yeah we i know

2685.92 --> 2689.319
i know that

2705.52 --> 2708.96
i have my input yeah didn't you know

2707.52 --> 2712.0
nathan

2708.96 --> 2712.0
nathan call it that

2713.92 --> 2718.64
like i was kind of unnerved by it at

2715.76 --> 2721.5200000000004
first like what i have a paradox named

2718.64 --> 2723.68
after me now okay

2721.52 --> 2727.359
hmm i felt like i was being ridiculed

2723.68 --> 2727.359
but it was actually quite serious

2729.68 --> 2734.7999999999997
it's weird having your own name attached

2732.16 --> 2734.7999999999997
to something

2736.24 --> 2740.0
but yeah they are winning in paradox

2738.4 --> 2742.0
what is it

2740.0 --> 2744.48
well it's the

2742.0 --> 2746.24
realization

2744.48 --> 2748.96
oh yeah it's the combination of the

2746.24 --> 2752.64
consequences of terrestrial refraction

2748.96 --> 2752.64
the black swan observation

2753.04 --> 2757.119
and yeah

2754.24 --> 2759.2799999999997
jumping back and forth

2757.119 --> 2761.76
because if

2759.28 --> 2763.599
well if you think the earth is a globe

2761.76 --> 2765.8390000000004
then the black swan observation

2763.599 --> 2769.28
disproves that

2765.839 --> 2770.72
it is the geometric globe

2769.28 --> 2772.96
if you then say oh terrestrial

2770.72 --> 2774.72
refraction it's not actually where you

2772.96 --> 2775.599
see it

2774.72 --> 2778.7999999999997
it's

2775.599 --> 2780.0
visually deviating from its geometric

2778.8 --> 2782.96
position

2780.0 --> 2784.72
well then suddenly

2782.96 --> 2786.079
things are not where you see them

2784.72 --> 2789.04
anymore

2786.079 --> 2791.92
and then you can't basically look at

2789.04 --> 2794.64
them or measure something you see

2791.92 --> 2796.16
in order to establish this geometry

2794.64 --> 2798.319
you're standing on

2796.16 --> 2802.0789999999997
like albiruni did

2798.319 --> 2805.2799999999997
supposedly historically

2802.079 --> 2806.5600000000004
he measured the horizon

2805.28 --> 2809.2000000000003
as if it was

2806.56 --> 2809.2
earth curve

2811.28 --> 2816.0
that's what the ballers threw at us so

2813.44 --> 2818.7200000000003
that's supposedly true well yeah the

2816.0 --> 2818.72
black swan

2819.68 --> 2823.68
like yeah you can

2821.44 --> 2825.92
measure the horizon and then

2823.68 --> 2827.9199999999996
calculate like oh so well it might be

2825.92 --> 2830.48
sort of a globe like that well guess

2827.92 --> 2834.079
what black swan observation completely

2830.48 --> 2835.599
disproves that possibility

2834.079 --> 2838.319
because if you're standing on the globe

2835.599 --> 2840.8
you could never see beyond the geometric

2838.319 --> 2842.48
horizon

2840.8 --> 2846.079
right

2842.48 --> 2849.2
unless you draw in the obvious

2846.079 --> 2850.8
exposed machination called terrestrial

2849.2 --> 2854.24
refraction

2850.8 --> 2856.8390000000004
which in short is used as refraction

2854.24 --> 2858.4799999999996
it's a fictional construct it it

2856.839 --> 2861.2
suggests

2858.48 --> 2863.119
that light bends around the sphere seven

2861.2 --> 2867.1189999999997
over six r rate

2863.119 --> 2870.48
the constant spherical rate

2867.119 --> 2871.76
and basically breaks the original

2870.48 --> 2873.839
assertion

2871.76 --> 2875.119
or attempts to break so that's part of

2873.839 --> 2876.4
the most important part of the

2875.119 --> 2878.1600000000003
machination

2876.4 --> 2881.28
it asserts

2878.16 --> 2883.359
that the horizon the optical

2881.28 --> 2884.6400000000003
apparent point

2883.359 --> 2886.5589999999997
line

2884.64 --> 2888.24
where the sky meets the grounds optical

2886.559 --> 2890.7200000000003
it's an optical effect that that

2888.24 --> 2893.5989999999997
displaces in relation to

2890.72 --> 2895.2799999999997
its geometry and that is optically

2893.599 --> 2897.28
impossible

2895.28 --> 2899.599
anything can be displaced through

2897.28 --> 2902.2400000000002
miraging and all that

2899.599 --> 2904.559
in relation to the horizon except for

2902.24 --> 2906.64
the horizon

2904.559 --> 2909.0400000000004
it can't

2906.64 --> 2911.2799999999997
right so it terrestrial refraction is a

2909.04 --> 2914.24
machination it's a

2911.28 --> 2917.44
parlor trick

2914.24 --> 2920.5589999999997
based in mathematics and it requires the

2917.44 --> 2923.359
arvo it's literally in the formula the

2920.559 --> 2926.079
radius value of earth is in the formula

2923.359 --> 2927.68
for its machination

2926.079 --> 2930.96
for its effect

2927.68 --> 2932.64
you need that r value well guess what as

2930.96 --> 2936.2400000000002
soon as you accept terrestrial

2932.64 --> 2939.1189999999997
refraction you can no longer get that r

2936.24 --> 2942.5589999999997
value it makes it impossible

2939.119 --> 2945.28
to actually measure the radius of earth

2942.559 --> 2946.7200000000003
even though the r value is part of the

2945.28 --> 2949.0400000000004
formula

2946.72 --> 2951.68
so if terrestrial refraction was real

2949.04 --> 2953.2799999999997
you could never establish the r value

2951.68 --> 2955.7599999999998
that it uses

2953.28 --> 2958.88
and that is the arwenian paradox that's

2955.76 --> 2958.88
the thing i discovered

2959.359 --> 2965.839
as a non-mathematician no less but i

2962.64 --> 2968.4
visually figured it out just

2965.839 --> 2972.4
you know math isn't always just literal

2968.4 --> 2975.839
math in my head it's patterns structures

2972.4 --> 2978.48
that do not display themselves to me

2975.839 --> 2980.5589999999997
like language

2978.48 --> 2984.48
it's more like statistics it's more like

2980.559 --> 2987.0400000000004
a 3d statistical thing that happens

2984.48 --> 2989.359
it's very intuitive

2987.04 --> 2991.2
and i just saw it like wait that's a

2989.359 --> 2993.839
paradox

2991.2 --> 2996.96
it requires r

2993.839 --> 2999.92
but yeah as soon as it is established

2996.96 --> 3001.52
then you it can no longer attain that r

2999.92 --> 3004.079
because things are not actually where

3001.52 --> 3005.52
you see them so how was the geometry

3004.079 --> 3006.96
then measured

3005.52 --> 3009.52
and yeah that's

3006.96 --> 3013.04
how the arwenian paradox was born in

3009.52 --> 3015.68
2020 i think in summer somewhere

3013.04 --> 3018.0
yeah i'm very proud to have that on my

3015.68 --> 3018.0
name

3021.44 --> 3025.28
spammers in chat

3023.359 --> 3027.04
oh yeah that

3025.28 --> 3028.6400000000003
thank you for for

3027.04 --> 3031.7599999999998
for moderating yeah that's just a

3028.64 --> 3031.7599999999998
standard uh

3032.48 --> 3037.599
standard advertisement bot very annoying

3035.52 --> 3040.72
it's going around it's been doing that

3037.599 --> 3041.44
for like a few months now it's not just

3040.72 --> 3043.839
me

3041.44 --> 3045.2000000000003
not just my chat it's everywhere it's

3043.839 --> 3048.24
like even in

3045.2 --> 3050.16
d life and

3048.24 --> 3053.72
so that's like they've they've opened up

3050.16 --> 3053.72
a can for that

3054.0 --> 3059.04
activated the spambots

3056.64 --> 3059.04
anyway

3061.76 --> 3066.3190000000004
you've owned this sexton for 25 years

3064.079 --> 3068.559
cool

3066.319 --> 3070.24
well i still have these memories from my

3068.559 --> 3072.2400000000002
freaking mother

3070.24 --> 3075.04
like my mother

3072.24 --> 3077.1189999999997
was interested in this sort of thing

3075.04 --> 3080.72
mostly from an angle of understanding

3077.119 --> 3080.7200000000003
astrology and the ancient world

3080.88 --> 3086.4
and she was like trying to put like

3083.839 --> 3088.0789999999997
sexton in my hand saying like this is

3086.4 --> 3090.8
really important

3088.079 --> 3092.7200000000003
or like one of these other instruments i

3090.8 --> 3094.559
don't even remember the names just these

3092.72 --> 3095.52
celestial things

3094.559 --> 3098.3190000000004
tools

3095.52 --> 3101.52
and was like oh that's really cool

3098.319 --> 3105.04
i'm not interested really in this moment

3101.52 --> 3107.52
that was when i was like 12 or something

3105.04 --> 3109.839
and i would just be like oh yeah i trust

3107.52 --> 3111.7599999999998
that that's pretty cool i'm not there

3109.839 --> 3114.88
with my mind right now

3111.76 --> 3117.0400000000004
i'm not really super interested

3114.88 --> 3119.76
and it also sounds like a chore with all

3117.04 --> 3120.88
the mathematical stuff in there

3119.76 --> 3124.4
like

3120.88 --> 3126.6400000000003
well i'm more concerned right now with

3124.4 --> 3130.8
what would be the most awesome movie i

3126.64 --> 3130.7999999999997
could ever imagine to come out

3131.359 --> 3136.319
i was more concerned with that sort of

3133.119 --> 3137.599
thing or like oh what would be the most

3136.319 --> 3139.599
beautiful

3137.599 --> 3142.2400000000002
spaceship design

3139.599 --> 3144.48
in my head for my legos or something

3142.24 --> 3144.4799999999996
right

3146.559 --> 3151.3590000000004
i just was not there with my mind

3150.0 --> 3153.68
but i did

3151.359 --> 3155.7599999999998
feel it out and knew like yeah yeah

3153.68 --> 3158.0789999999997
those are

3155.76 --> 3159.76
ancient instruments there's mysteries i

3158.079 --> 3163.04
just knew like there's mysteries about

3159.76 --> 3164.88
the heavens and all that and

3163.04 --> 3166.92
but

3164.88 --> 3168.88
so i had already kind of like

3166.92 --> 3171.28
pre-compartmentalized it a little like

3168.88 --> 3174.079
the heavens as in the stars as in what

3171.28 --> 3176.1600000000003
was used for exploration

3174.079 --> 3179.2000000000003
but then on the other side double earth

3176.16 --> 3181.1189999999997
with space galaxies what could they be

3179.2 --> 3183.2799999999997
how far away is that

3181.119 --> 3186.2400000000002
what's really going on in there how long

3183.28 --> 3187.6800000000003
ago was that what we're seeing right now

3186.24 --> 3189.839
right

3187.68 --> 3191.68
i was just compartmentalizing it and it

3189.839 --> 3193.599
was still very much on the space

3191.68 --> 3195.04
bandwagon

3193.599 --> 3197.599
so i just wasn't really all that

3195.04 --> 3197.599
interested

3202.0 --> 3209.72
but i'm really happy to now much much

3204.88 --> 3209.7200000000003
later in life go through it all again

3213.52 --> 3216.72
and now having more attention to

3215.359 --> 3217.7599999999998
actually

3216.72 --> 3220.839
get it

3217.76 --> 3224.4
get the information understand the whole

3220.839 --> 3226.16
context like have patience for that

3224.4 --> 3229.52
right now because i didn't when i was

3226.16 --> 3229.52
young i just didn't care

3232.24 --> 3235.68
i mean

3233.599 --> 3239.2000000000003
pictures of like

3235.68 --> 3242.7999999999997
domed worlds like huge terrariums i

3239.2 --> 3242.7999999999997
thought that those were fascinating

3244.24 --> 3249.7999999999997
but it was more for artistic fascination

3253.599 --> 3257.92
like i've seen like

3255.76 --> 3259.3590000000004
representation of like domed flat

3257.92 --> 3261.76
earth's

3259.359 --> 3264.5589999999997
not what we see now but like there's

3261.76 --> 3266.88
this book even what's it called is this

3264.559 --> 3268.6400000000003
one book it's an older book from like

3266.88 --> 3271.76
mid 20th century

3268.64 --> 3275.52
and there's literally this domed

3271.76 --> 3275.5200000000004
picture of an earth on there

3277.119 --> 3282.0
i didn't even

3279.76 --> 3286.6400000000003
really believe

3282.0 --> 3288.64
that the earth would be flat like that

3286.64 --> 3291.64
but i was like yeah that's just really

3288.64 --> 3291.64
interesting

3292.16 --> 3295.68
but

3292.96 --> 3297.92
yeah i was the ball was very much round

3295.68 --> 3300.96
in my head already right

3297.92 --> 3303.92
it was already tough to let that go

3300.96 --> 3307.079
through just exposure and movies and

3303.92 --> 3307.079
all that

3307.359 --> 3311.04
but it was still just like that's

3308.88 --> 3312.96
interesting that looks interesting i

3311.04 --> 3315.2799999999997
wonder like what their thoughts behind

3312.96 --> 3315.28
it are

3316.96 --> 3324.839
got kicked out of sunday school what how

3320.48 --> 3324.839
did that happen seeking star wars

3341.44 --> 3344.64
no friends because of it

3351.52 --> 3356.24
well i think that my parents or my

3353.76 --> 3358.2400000000002
mother at least was a bit into flat

3356.24 --> 3360.16
earth for a while

3358.24 --> 3363.4399999999996
and we're talking like

3360.16 --> 3366.64
19 yeah still 20th century

3363.44 --> 3366.64
90 something

3369.119 --> 3373.6800000000003
and

3371.04 --> 3378.16
it was just

3373.68 --> 3380.64
the amount of trigger effect that even

3378.16 --> 3381.68
bringing it up would have on people made

3380.64 --> 3386.319
me

3381.68 --> 3386.319
avoid it as much as i humanly could

3388.48 --> 3391.839
like

3389.359 --> 3394.24
i didn't even allow myself to have the

3391.839 --> 3396.5589999999997
impulses to dwell on it

3394.24 --> 3398.64
it was that bad

3396.559 --> 3400.7200000000003
like the times i kind of casually

3398.64 --> 3402.16
brought it up this is just like oh i

3400.72 --> 3405.2799999999997
just looked into this

3402.16 --> 3406.96
the responses were psychologically so

3405.28 --> 3409.8390000000004
violent

3406.96 --> 3412.92
from people like kids my age

3409.839 --> 3416.64
or even their parents they were like so

3412.92 --> 3419.359
insidiously angry at me as a little kid

3416.64 --> 3420.319
it's just like okay

3419.359 --> 3424.88
this

3420.319 --> 3426.96
like you can never talk about this ever

3424.88 --> 3429.359
and like not because they're telling you

3426.96 --> 3431.92
but because the responses from people

3429.359 --> 3434.64
were so out of control out of place

3431.92 --> 3437.599
insane and aggressive

3434.64 --> 3440.24
that i felt viscerally threatened

3437.599 --> 3443.2000000000003
like if i bring this up like that could

3440.24 --> 3445.839
potentially get me killed at some point

3443.2 --> 3447.839
like that is how serious the allergic

3445.839 --> 3449.359
responses were

3447.839 --> 3454.319
and my parents

3449.359 --> 3454.319
were being very careful about it too

3454.64 --> 3459.359
because we had some like insane

3456.88 --> 3461.92
responses to that like so aggressive

3459.359 --> 3464.64
it's unbelievable

3461.92 --> 3467.359
not with physical destroying things but

3464.64 --> 3469.2799999999997
like to the point where that could

3467.359 --> 3471.839
happen if we'd actually continued

3469.28 --> 3471.8390000000004
pushing it

3472.16 --> 3476.64
might have gotten us beaten up if we

3474.16 --> 3476.64
done that

3477.92 --> 3484.28
right it was a different age very

3480.319 --> 3484.2799999999997
different times back then

3494.16 --> 3497.16
anyway

3503.92 --> 3509.96
question to bible content

3506.96 --> 3509.96
hmm

3521.359 --> 3526.5589999999997
well i would question details about it

3523.68 --> 3529.2799999999997
but i it took me a very long time before

3526.559 --> 3531.92
i even had a basic oversight over what

3529.28 --> 3534.799
was going on in the bible

3531.92 --> 3536.88
i could barely summarize like the rough

3534.799 --> 3539.44
main events

3536.88 --> 3539.44
apparently

3541.44 --> 3545.839
so the bible for me i was always like

3543.52 --> 3545.839
just like

3546.16 --> 3550.0789999999997
knew like that's something i would have

3547.839 --> 3552.0789999999997
to understand it's really important to

3550.079 --> 3556.319
people

3552.079 --> 3556.319
but i wasn't just super interested

3557.359 --> 3562.799
i think that that's basically only come

3560.16 --> 3562.799
recently

3564.4 --> 3568.319
like eight years ago

3567.04 --> 3570.64
when i also

3568.319 --> 3573.839
well dove into the mormon church over

3570.64 --> 3573.839
here for a year

3577.359 --> 3581.839
before that i've kind of always blocked

3579.44 --> 3581.839
it out

3582.64 --> 3586.96
as in accepting they exist but never

3584.799 --> 3590.96
taking it serious like

3586.96 --> 3590.96
never actually being that interested

3598.16 --> 3602.8799999999997
blue pills will defend the matrix

3612.88 --> 3617.359
well yeah classical homeopath but i

3615.359 --> 3620.0
don't know man some people out there

3617.359 --> 3622.0789999999997
must have been subjected to some really

3620.0 --> 3626.4
savage conditioning

3622.079 --> 3626.4
because i remember just at a time

3626.839 --> 3632.72
where yeah i get sometimes into defiant

3630.319 --> 3634.48
mood so i would just say it i would just

3632.72 --> 3636.64
be like no

3634.48 --> 3638.64
no you're just an acceptance

3636.64 --> 3641.92
i had times where i was like

3638.64 --> 3644.96
almost like hit by other adults because

3641.92 --> 3646.319
they were so pissed off at me

3644.96 --> 3648.48
for

3646.319 --> 3651.68
standing firm with those types of things

3648.48 --> 3651.68
like dude i was a

3654.4 --> 3660.799
a kid that got into hazardous moods

3658.4 --> 3663.76
at times where i'd be like yeah i'm

3660.799 --> 3666.48
gonna start a fight

3663.76 --> 3669.0400000000004
like i'm not gonna push like deuce but

3666.48 --> 3672.799
i'm going to psychologically start this

3669.04 --> 3672.799
fire like i'm going to now

3672.88 --> 3679.2000000000003
basically make people

3675.68 --> 3681.7599999999998
well hate me or attack me

3679.2 --> 3683.5989999999997
because i'm gonna tell them things that

3681.76 --> 3685.8390000000004
they do they want to keep a secret to

3683.599 --> 3685.839
themselves

3686.48 --> 3691.599
it's almost like yeah psychological

3688.72 --> 3695.52
bullying in a way

3691.599 --> 3698.079
but it also was born out of this weird

3695.52 --> 3700.799
sense of isolation like my empathy i

3698.079 --> 3704.1600000000003
would i sense it when people keep

3700.799 --> 3707.119
secrets okay to themselves i sense when

3704.16 --> 3709.2799999999997
people keep secrets to themselves

3707.119 --> 3711.76
like for their selves

3709.28 --> 3714.0
not like for others but when they keep

3711.76 --> 3716.559
the secret for them their own

3714.0 --> 3719.52
consciousness i feel it

3716.559 --> 3721.76
i literally feel it it gives me a

3719.52 --> 3723.44
psychological poking

3721.76 --> 3726.0
tendency

3723.44 --> 3729.68
and i did that a lot as a kid and i got

3726.0 --> 3733.039
some people drove in completely nuts

3729.68 --> 3733.839
because of that i was a hazardous kid

3733.039 --> 3735.8390000000004
like

3733.839 --> 3738.24
a wise ass

3735.839 --> 3739.599
like sometimes you love me sometimes you

3738.24 --> 3742.64
really want to kick me in the ass

3739.599 --> 3747.0
because i just don't shut the up

3742.64 --> 3747.0
don't stop talking when it should

3767.68 --> 3773.0299999999997
right

3769.41 --> 3773.0299999999997
[Music]

3776.96 --> 3780.0
yeah people can

3778.48 --> 3782.319
definitely hate it when you can see

3780.0 --> 3785.68
right through them and yeah the same by

3782.319 --> 3787.839
the way goes for certain women

3785.68 --> 3790.48
there's just certain women

3787.839 --> 3792.88
that are sensitive and i just

3790.48 --> 3796.079
see them i just see everything about

3792.88 --> 3797.839
them and they feel that i can see them

3796.079 --> 3800.1600000000003
and they hate me

3797.839 --> 3801.2
they hate me they hate my presence every

3800.16 --> 3802.8799999999997
time

3801.2 --> 3805.5989999999997
every time they pick up on my presence

3802.88 --> 3806.48
they're like i hate you

3805.599 --> 3809.119
why

3806.48 --> 3812.96
because i can feel exactly what they're

3809.119 --> 3815.44
feeling and i actually kind of well

3812.96 --> 3817.599
find things attractive about them

3815.44 --> 3819.68
but difficult i don't really approach

3817.599 --> 3822.319
them but they know

3819.68 --> 3824.799
i can feel them and so they just

3822.319 --> 3828.0
immediately like

3824.799 --> 3831.0389999999998
cycle yeah spiritually defend themselves

3828.0 --> 3831.039
like attack me

3832.16 --> 3836.16
in defense

3833.839 --> 3837.68
like even though i've never

3836.16 --> 3841.92
talked to them

3837.68 --> 3841.9199999999996
right they still have that attitude

3843.599 --> 3847.3590000000004
but it might also be because they

3845.44 --> 3849.359
actually do find me attractive but they

3847.359 --> 3851.44
don't want to engage so they kind of

3849.359 --> 3852.5589999999997
like have to get aggressive just to be

3851.44 --> 3857.2000000000003
able to

3852.559 --> 3858.079
keep their hands off me because yes i am

3857.2 --> 3862.0789999999997
very

3858.079 --> 3863.76
freaking attractive to certain women

3862.079 --> 3867.599
i know i am

3863.76 --> 3871.5200000000004
i do my best not to abuse it

3867.599 --> 3871.52
that sounds super confident doesn't it

3871.92 --> 3876.48
for a guy that's been single for eight

3874.079 --> 3877.76
years but it is true though you know

3876.48 --> 3879.839
because

3877.76 --> 3881.92
if i'd engage in that i'd be doing what

3879.839 --> 3884.319
i was doing like

3881.92 --> 3888.079
20 years ago

3884.319 --> 3890.24
it's just going after those women

3888.079 --> 3892.1600000000003
but not really from an interest of like

3890.24 --> 3893.9199999999996
i want to form a family but just like

3892.16 --> 3896.64
yeah i just want to wanna wanna bang

3893.92 --> 3899.359
that basically

3896.64 --> 3902.64
and with love though

3899.359 --> 3904.4
but nothing beyond that

3902.64 --> 3906.5589999999997
and

3904.4 --> 3909.559
i'm just different now i'm much more

3906.559 --> 3909.559
careful

3911.68 --> 3915.5989999999997
take it much more serious now when that

3913.92 --> 3918.7200000000003
happens so and

3915.599 --> 3921.92
yeah it's becoming much rarer also to

3918.72 --> 3923.7599999999998
even find women that i do actually find

3921.92 --> 3926.48
attractive

3923.76 --> 3929.92
to a level where i know i can bind with

3926.48 --> 3929.92
them on the long run

3930.319 --> 3934.64
i mean there's plenty of women that are

3932.16 --> 3936.96
just that are kind of they're nice or

3934.64 --> 3939.92
they're warm or they're cute

3936.96 --> 3940.64
or they're even kind of sexy

3939.92 --> 3942.96
but

3940.64 --> 3945.52
then they have just this one thing and

3942.96 --> 3949.2
the rest is a mess

3945.52 --> 3951.839
and probably not going to be fixed

3949.2 --> 3954.0
and i just like nope i'm sorry it's just

3951.839 --> 3956.319
not good enough it sounds really bad

3954.0 --> 3957.599
like it when i say that it's just like

3956.319 --> 3959.359
no

3957.599 --> 3961.6800000000003
i mean they could probably force

3959.359 --> 3963.839
themselves on me and get a one-eyed

3961.68 --> 3966.64
stand or something

3963.839 --> 3969.7599999999998
if i actually find them attractive but

3966.64 --> 3969.7599999999998
to get beyond that

3970.4 --> 3975.92
you gotta be like a goddess and not just

3973.359 --> 3978.64
somebody that thinks they are

3975.92 --> 3982.88
yeah especially not those

3978.64 --> 3982.8799999999997
but just actually have that power

3983.68 --> 3986.64
that women can have

3986.88 --> 3993.76
kind of like well my roommate

3990.4 --> 3996.799
definitely does and i find her like

3993.76 --> 3996.7990000000004
really attractive

4004.079 --> 4007.28
maybe that's why women don't like me

4005.599 --> 4008.799
they hate guys that are

4007.28 --> 4010.48
no but it's

4008.799 --> 4014.72
they feel

4010.48 --> 4014.72
defenseless okay look

4015.359 --> 4019.7599999999998
they don't hate guys

4017.359 --> 4021.52
that are like that they actually find

4019.76 --> 4025.119
them attractive

4021.52 --> 4027.839
it's just that it scares them

4025.119 --> 4029.839
you see that's how it works

4027.839 --> 4032.839
they don't actually hate guys that can

4029.839 --> 4035.44
feel exactly over there it scares

4032.839 --> 4038.96
them it makes them afraid that you could

4035.44 --> 4038.96
take control you see

4039.28 --> 4045.2000000000003
that they would be kind of like

4042.0 --> 4046.88
forced to surrender to that

4045.2 --> 4048.5589999999997
that a lot of women don't want that and

4046.88 --> 4050.319
they've been like very strongly

4048.559 --> 4052.3190000000004
conditioned

4050.319 --> 4054.72
through modern culture to reject that

4052.319 --> 4057.52
also which is a great detriment to

4054.72 --> 4059.4399999999996
themselves really

4057.52 --> 4062.4
but then again there might be some guys

4059.44 --> 4064.4
that are just completely and utterly

4062.4 --> 4067.119
abusing that

4064.4 --> 4068.88
and actually are like yeah i'm going to

4067.119 --> 4070.799
freaking manipulate that woman to

4068.88 --> 4073.52
surrender herself to me and

4070.799 --> 4075.599
promise whatever i want and then just at

4073.52 --> 4078.64
the end dump her and lie this is

4075.599 --> 4082.96
disgusting i hate those like that makes

4078.64 --> 4085.92
me want to literally when i find out

4082.96 --> 4088.7200000000003
that some guys do that i hate them i

4085.92 --> 4091.76
will not respect you

4088.72 --> 4095.9199999999996
for that yeah i will never accept that

4091.76 --> 4097.679
you think that's acceptable behavior

4095.92 --> 4100.4
to lie

4097.679 --> 4101.759
to women and then dump them

4100.4 --> 4104.759
it's

4101.759 --> 4104.759
terrible

4107.04 --> 4112.319
i hate men like that so yeah i'm all

4109.6 --> 4114.64
with women i hate men like that too

4112.319 --> 4116.719
guess what i don't act like that yeah i

4114.64 --> 4119.839
have

4116.719 --> 4119.839
i have power

4120.719 --> 4125.359
but i don't do that with women i mean

4127.04 --> 4132.319
probably being a bad boy

4130.0 --> 4134.159
if you like that i could be a bad boy if

4132.319 --> 4136.64
you like you know but it's never gonna

4134.159 --> 4140.839
be real

4136.64 --> 4140.839
i'm actually a really good boy

4146.08 --> 4149.759
good boys sometimes with a bit of

4149.839 --> 4154.5599999999995
passion issues where it just gets too

4151.92 --> 4156.799
strong and

4154.56 --> 4158.56
leading to either drama or extreme

4156.799 --> 4161.56
stress or something

4158.56 --> 4161.56
but

4162.0 --> 4166.159
i am a good boy

4164.56 --> 4168.56
that sounds really silly to say it like

4166.159 --> 4170.879999999999
that but you know what i mean

4168.56 --> 4170.88
right

4171.04 --> 4175.759
but yeah a lot of women don't like you

4173.279 --> 4178.319
because you actually get to them

4175.759 --> 4178.319
as a man

4180.239 --> 4183.04
right

4181.12 --> 4185.839
they might for example find it

4183.04 --> 4185.839
distracting

4187.359 --> 4192.0
right just like well let's just say

4189.679 --> 4194.4
you're you're doing a job

4192.0 --> 4196.96
and your direct colleague is

4194.4 --> 4201.799999999999
let's just say if i had a job was like a

4196.96 --> 4201.8
really freaking attractive woman

4202.159 --> 4207.92
and she's kind of like flirting with you

4205.36 --> 4209.599999999999
well yeah you could go for it if you

4207.92 --> 4211.12
don't really give a but what if

4209.6 --> 4214.4800000000005
your career is really important what if

4211.12 --> 4216.96
you're at the same time actually

4214.48 --> 4218.959999999999
just starting a marriage

4216.96 --> 4220.159
it's very serious and yet kids yeah then

4218.96 --> 4222.8
it's like

4220.159 --> 4225.92
could you please not be so freaking

4222.8 --> 4228.2390000000005
attractive in my face all the time right

4225.92 --> 4231.1990000000005
well women

4228.239 --> 4234.48
can definitely have that too

4231.199 --> 4237.199
right and you're you as a guy

4234.48 --> 4238.799999999999
we as guys unless you're like oh i'm

4237.199 --> 4239.599999999999
such a peacock

4238.8 --> 4241.28
right

4239.6 --> 4244.64
most don't even realize what's

4241.28 --> 4246.48
attractive about them to women because

4244.64 --> 4248.8
the guys among one another don't really

4246.48 --> 4250.159
see it that much

4248.8 --> 4251.679
women do

4250.159 --> 4256.599999999999
there's something really attractive

4251.679 --> 4256.6
about you they will notice that

4261.28 --> 4267.4
do you read eckhart tolle books no

4263.76 --> 4267.400000000001
i don't read books

4280.96 --> 4284.4
anyway

4282.64 --> 4288.159000000001
i hope you appreciate that input i hope

4284.4 --> 4288.159
i got it right seeking star wars

4289.199 --> 4294.08
since you are a woman

4292.64 --> 4295.92
and i think you

4294.08 --> 4298.8
though you're sensitive so you would

4295.92 --> 4300.159
have been confronted

4298.8 --> 4302.96
so you would have been confronted with

4300.159 --> 4305.96
those types of situations am i anywhere

4302.96 --> 4305.96
close

4334.88 --> 4338.92
ah glad to hear it

4368.84 --> 4373.719
right oh new relationships

4375.92 --> 4380.6
yeah

4377.36 --> 4380.599999999999
i wonder

4385.04 --> 4389.6
i wonder what women will choose to bump

4387.12 --> 4389.599999999999
into me

4394.08 --> 4397.28
do i still got it

4397.52 --> 4400.8
like on the high level

4401.679 --> 4407.52
and also will i finally be able to get

4404.88 --> 4409.679
like the more dramatic and weakened side

4407.52 --> 4411.6
under control because

4409.679 --> 4414.2390000000005
yeah

4411.6 --> 4418.96
that's part of me too

4414.239 --> 4421.28
it's actually quite off-putting to some

4418.96 --> 4423.52
like even to myself i wish

4421.28 --> 4426.96
like when i engage in a relationship i

4423.52 --> 4429.84
just have that epic side

4426.96 --> 4433.52
and just be that monolithic man

4429.84 --> 4433.52
just that is ready to defend

4435.199 --> 4439.839999999999
yeah my lady etc and the good in the

4438.32 --> 4442.48
world

4439.84 --> 4444.56
and just not have that weak side anymore

4442.48 --> 4448.0
but of course i will have that weak side

4444.56 --> 4448.0
but i might be able to just

4449.04 --> 4454.64
be able to find better ways of wielding

4451.44 --> 4457.04
it so it doesn't disrupt as much it

4454.64 --> 4457.04
doesn't

4457.36 --> 4461.28
dispel

4458.8 --> 4461.28
anything

4462.48 --> 4466.639999999999
because that's my ego that's like

4464.239 --> 4469.12
literally almost getting obsessed by

4466.64 --> 4472.08
with ruining the relationship

4469.12 --> 4474.719
that's real it's terrible

4472.08 --> 4477.12
why is it terrible because

4474.719 --> 4478.2390000000005
it actually presents itself like a good

4477.12 --> 4483.159
thing to me

4478.239 --> 4483.159
from the inside it's it's like terrible

4484.48 --> 4489.28
but then again maybe i just never really

4486.719 --> 4491.199
had the right sort of relationship maybe

4489.28 --> 4493.679
i was never really ready it was all

4491.199 --> 4495.44
bunch of trials and my intuition knew

4493.679 --> 4497.1990000000005
that so it just was like yeah you're

4495.44 --> 4500.08
done with this now

4497.199 --> 4503.04
i know you'd like to hang on forever

4500.08 --> 4505.12
and dream about like prince and princess

4503.04 --> 4506.96
dreams and all that forever

4505.12 --> 4508.48
you never want to let go but you're

4506.96 --> 4511.12
gonna have to let go because you're not

4508.48 --> 4514.32
even ready yet for a real relationship

4511.12 --> 4516.239
maybe that's it who's to say you know

4514.32 --> 4517.599999999999
it's very difficult to even make that

4516.239 --> 4520.799999999999
out like

4517.6 --> 4520.8
what was that

4521.92 --> 4526.4
was that just like some kind of evil

4524.08 --> 4530.0
ruining it for me or was it actually

4526.4 --> 4530.0
good trying to protect me

4530.4 --> 4533.639999999999
don't know

4542.56 --> 4548.64
april fools not no

4546.0 --> 4553.719
you're a bit early

4548.64 --> 4553.719
like four months early george sanford

4571.44 --> 4576.239
messed up calendar keeps us poof nah

4576.4 --> 4580.0
yeah whatever

4578.32 --> 4581.679
i don't think it really keeps us off

4580.0 --> 4583.84
balance there's a lot more wrong with

4581.679 --> 4585.76
the calendar than just when the new year

4583.84 --> 4588.2390000000005
supposed to start

4585.76 --> 4591.76
like how about why aren't there 13

4588.239 --> 4594.5599999999995
months like now that's

4591.76 --> 4597.04
much more serious

4594.56 --> 4599.6
like why aren't there just 13 months

4597.04 --> 4602.96
it's insane

4599.6 --> 4606.8
like it should be 13 months done oh 12

4602.96 --> 4606.8
because 12 is so important

4606.88 --> 4612.0
well yeah but there's actually 13 months

4610.56 --> 4614.159000000001
in a year you know

4612.0 --> 4617.44
so it's kind of like

4614.159 --> 4620.159
screw your 12. like we don't care it's

4617.44 --> 4621.919999999999
actually 13 months why does it have to

4620.159 --> 4624.719
be forced into twelve it makes no

4621.92 --> 4624.719
freaking sense

4626.719 --> 4629.04
right

4631.679 --> 4635.6
like when the new year starts or

4633.52 --> 4639.360000000001
something i don't know

4635.6 --> 4642.320000000001
probably should be what you said like it

4639.36 --> 4642.32
solves this but

4644.64 --> 4650.1990000000005
it's pretty much arbitrary it's just a

4646.64 --> 4650.1990000000005
calendar year

4669.52 --> 4676.360000000001
it doesn't come out even in the 36

4672.48 --> 4676.36
degree circle what

4680.8 --> 4683.8
so

4700.96 --> 4704.64
right yeah the calendar

4702.64 --> 4706.8
yeah the overall color is issues but

4704.64 --> 4710.400000000001
that's also because of just time you

4706.8 --> 4710.400000000001
know time is very elusive

4710.64 --> 4716.88
it's complicated like if you watch the

4714.32 --> 4719.199
was the video again

4716.88 --> 4721.84
i think you brought it up yesterday too

4719.199 --> 4721.839999999999
it's a name again

4734.719 --> 4739.28
the history of or what is it

4741.92 --> 4745.64
history of the world

4749.679 --> 4753.12
right

4750.88 --> 4754.96
from lhfe

4753.12 --> 4758.88
that yeah

4754.96 --> 4758.88
the lost history of flat earth right

4758.96 --> 4762.8
it

4760.159 --> 4766.4
it lays that out like the

4762.8 --> 4768.4800000000005
the the mechanism behind time

4766.4 --> 4770.799999999999
in the tail

4768.48 --> 4773.759999999999
and you can't get it right it's like

4770.8 --> 4776.719
it's almost like god arranged the

4773.76 --> 4780.0
celestial cycles in a way

4776.719 --> 4784.32
that man can literally never

4780.0 --> 4786.719
mechanically emulate it like you cannot

4784.32 --> 4790.719
make a mechanism a physical mechanism

4786.719 --> 4793.04
that would be accurate ever

4790.719 --> 4793.04
very

4793.679 --> 4800.4
well very architect very god i'd say to

4797.76 --> 4802.2390000000005
do that to be like yeah oh oh you think

4800.4 --> 4805.12
you're special you can think you can

4802.239 --> 4807.599999999999
recreate that well guess what i'm the

4805.12 --> 4810.32
architect

4807.6 --> 4812.0
you ain't no god

4810.32 --> 4814.08
you can't do that

4812.0 --> 4816.56
i only god can

4814.08 --> 4820.4
the maker of this realm

4816.56 --> 4820.400000000001
yeah lost history of flat earth right

4825.84 --> 4830.32
so yeah that was a great video

4828.0 --> 4831.44
let me put that in chat i looked up the

4830.32 --> 4833.12
link

4831.44 --> 4835.5199999999995
so you could watch it yourself if you

4833.12 --> 4839.04
haven't done that it's really good to

4835.52 --> 4843.4400000000005
think about like the celestial clock

4839.04 --> 4843.44
which is a big part of that video

4844.239 --> 4848.638999999999
i thought it was really intense

4846.56 --> 4850.080000000001
and inspiring so if you want to look for

4848.639 --> 4850.96
some really

4850.08 --> 4853.76
deep

4850.96 --> 4854.88
flat earth stuff this is the video to

4853.76 --> 4856.719
watch

4854.88 --> 4859.36
it's pretty much timeless

4856.719 --> 4862.4
so like this video would still be very

4859.36 --> 4865.679
good next year

4862.4 --> 4865.679
it's one it's a keeper

4866.8 --> 4869.52
so yeah check it out if you haven't

4868.32 --> 4873.12
already

4869.52 --> 4878.4400000000005
i'm gonna round out the show though

4873.12 --> 4878.44

oh well

4896.88 --> 4902.1990000000005

4913.679 --> 4916.679
okay

4935.199 --> 4937.678999999999

4946.56 --> 4950.56
really good

4948.239 --> 4954.718999999999
i'm feeling a lot better than i have for

4950.56 --> 4957.84
a while so let's hope that persists

4954.719 --> 4959.28
no more tense more like starts i don't

4957.84 --> 4961.4400000000005
like that anymore

4959.28 --> 4964.32
i wouldn't just be fluid

4961.44 --> 4964.32
and at ease

4964.4 --> 4966.719
free

4967.36 --> 4969.36
right

4968.4 --> 4971.839999999999
