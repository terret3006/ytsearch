see

115.439 --> 118.079
what i mean

118.24 --> 123.19999999999999
it's definitely not

120.079 --> 123.19999999999999
naturally formed

123.6 --> 126.479
so yeah there's like

125.2 --> 128.56
crosses

126.479 --> 132.959
i don't the cam can pick it up but i'm

128.56 --> 132.959
seeing like a cross right over there

136.72 --> 141.2
so yeah but despite that it's still

139.04 --> 143.67999999999998
really nice and warm

141.2 --> 147.599
there isn't a lot of wind

143.68 --> 147.59900000000002
which really warms up the air

148.319 --> 152.23899999999998
so yeah nice and warm spring day out

150.959 --> 155.879

um

237.2 --> 242.319
man by the way yesterday sean hawkins

239.599 --> 242.319
emailed me

242.64 --> 248.39999999999998
because of the video i linked up with

245.28 --> 253.12
from owen benjamin

248.4 --> 254.56
saying you racist piece of [ __ ] really

253.12 --> 256.639
this is

254.56 --> 259.44
so pathetic but yeah

256.639 --> 259.44
sean hawkins

260.16 --> 265.079
there's not a lot of things that he

261.519 --> 265.079
actually gets

277.6 --> 284.72
dielectric okay

280.96 --> 284.71999999999997
i'm not very interested in that

285.12 --> 290.4
right so yes this flatters debate was

288.16 --> 292.72
interesting very productive

290.4 --> 297.0
more about ether the subject of the

292.72 --> 297.0
month is ether i guess

298.8 --> 303.12
yeah it was great

300.32 --> 305.12
i was able to help out here and there

303.12 --> 306.88
just laying down what it is

305.12 --> 310.44
again i've been doing that on my own

306.88 --> 310.44
show too but

311.28 --> 313.75899999999996
yeah it was

312.4 --> 315.67999999999995
pretty long

313.759 --> 319.759
after show

315.68 --> 321.6
so yeah i would have made a fine show

319.759 --> 324.639
we'll see it back

321.6 --> 326.96000000000004
wonder what's gonna happen today on flat

324.639 --> 328.72
earth debate hope there is a flat earth

326.96 --> 332.23999999999995
debate live

328.72 --> 332.24
you never really know these days

333.6 --> 339.72
you may have caught the rv syndrome oh

336.0 --> 339.72
dear matthew hall

340.16 --> 345.72
i don't know if that's really worth

341.919 --> 345.71999999999997
laughing over

368.639 --> 371.639
right

389.44 --> 395.56
got some gusto

391.68 --> 395.56
i'm not sure like

396.479 --> 400.479
what it's doing for me today but

399.41 --> 402.8
[Music]

400.479 --> 406.24
i opened it up earlier

402.8 --> 406.24
i just have to drink it

406.8 --> 410.40000000000003
and got green tea of course but

410.72 --> 416.59900000000005
right so yeah i don't really have

412.319 --> 416.599
anything specific to talk about

432.56 --> 437.84
i guess yeah jim bob is great again

439.44 --> 443.039
really enjoying those streams

443.36 --> 447.599
oh yeah uh

446.24 --> 450.72
eric to be

447.599 --> 452.8
had a video ancient hidden history

450.72 --> 456.319
and

452.8 --> 458.24
it it was a pretty decent video

456.319 --> 460.0
it was more like more of a basic

458.24 --> 463.199
approach

460.0 --> 465.199
but effective so i like that some good

463.199 --> 467.84000000000003
pictures and all that

465.199 --> 469.12
yeah typical good quality eric debay

467.84 --> 471.84
video right

469.12 --> 473.68
for however he conducts himself like in

471.84 --> 476.08
social media and all that

473.68 --> 478.56
that's one thing but yeah

476.08 --> 481.19899999999996
you gotta give it to him like he

478.56 --> 483.919
is really good at making the video the

481.199 --> 483.91900000000004
way he does it

484.879 --> 488.16
i have to respect that

491.52 --> 494.79999999999995
jim bob and owen

496.96 --> 501.44
i haven't seen like owen benjamin back

499.28 --> 504.0
from yesterday yet i only get to see it

501.44 --> 506.0
afterward on bit shoot

504.0 --> 508.8
i noticed this morning that he had

506.0 --> 511.36
christopher gardner on

508.8 --> 513.2
i watched like 15 minutes of that but

511.36 --> 515.6800000000001
then yeah i have to start my show

513.2 --> 515.6800000000001
sometime

517.599 --> 521.24
that seemed enjoyable

521.929 --> 525.2389999999999
[Music]

526.64 --> 530.36
oh tear it

538.64 --> 543.279
dude look if you're gonna go by rv was

541.279 --> 545.68
right about me what did he even talk

543.279 --> 549.0
about me like what did he say about me i

545.68 --> 549.0
want to know

551.839 --> 557.839
like

553.12 --> 557.839
has he made an actual analysis about me

558.0 --> 561.31
because i don't hear a lot of people do

560.16 --> 565.8199999999999
that

561.31 --> 565.8199999999999
[Music]

566.48 --> 570.32
but yeah i have 33 in my email

569.519 --> 572.16
so

570.32 --> 574.24
it's right there

572.16 --> 577.24
yeah it's there every day that's my

574.24 --> 577.24
email

579.76 --> 585.04
i mean it's only gonna be called flat

582.32 --> 590.839
earth early bird 1233

585.04 --> 590.8389999999999
one time you gotta realize that right

594.16 --> 598.399
[Music]

595.68 --> 598.399
yes he did

598.72 --> 602.8000000000001
he did that guys you gotta i wanna watch

601.2 --> 605.2
it i wanna see uh

602.8 --> 606.399
rv's analysis about me really i want to

605.2 --> 608.5600000000001
see it

606.399 --> 610.88
and then i want to analyze his analysis

608.56 --> 610.88
of me

615.76 --> 622.64
people barely talk about me

619.2 --> 626.08
i guess i'm kind of like hard to

622.64 --> 630.919
to get a grip on or something

626.08 --> 630.9190000000001
[Music]

633.68 --> 638.399
like most of the time people just like

635.44 --> 640.6400000000001
to talk about me like oh he's just a

638.399 --> 643.12
nathan oakley stooge right they like to

640.64 --> 646.64
put me in that

643.12 --> 648.64
position where i'm i'm just doing my

646.64 --> 650.8
what i do because of somebody else

648.64 --> 653.04
that's what people in general like to do

650.8 --> 655.8389999999999
when they

653.04 --> 657.68
scoff at me

655.839 --> 660.8800000000001
but when it comes to like personal

657.68 --> 661.76
analysis i don't hear that a lot

660.88 --> 665.04
really

661.76 --> 665.04
that's like very rare

665.36 --> 669.6800000000001
other than

666.8 --> 671.76
on the fly to kind of make make me look

669.68 --> 673.76
bad in the moment right not an actual

671.76 --> 678.3199999999999
analysis i don't see that out there i

673.76 --> 678.3199999999999
mean i do it all the time myself

678.88 --> 684.959
i don't see other people do it though

682.399 --> 687.2
yes they do all the time okay really do

684.959 --> 691.8
you have a video of that cliff santas

687.2 --> 691.8000000000001
link me up i want to see that

712.48 --> 717.8000000000001
you get on it oh yeah

714.399 --> 717.8
you do that

733.92 --> 740.04
because i mean you're like the first

735.519 --> 740.04
person to even bring that up so

744.16 --> 750.0
you want to watch

746.0 --> 752.16
my analysis of rv's analysis more

750.0 --> 754.399
right and then let's see if rv is going

752.16 --> 756.8389999999999
to have analysis about my analysis about

754.399 --> 759.76
his analysis about

756.839 --> 762.1600000000001
me and if that'll still may have any

759.76 --> 762.16
points

762.639 --> 765.639
now

777.6 --> 780.6
so

797.36 --> 802.0790000000001
oh wait you guys probably think that was

799.44 --> 804.24
a joke right

802.079 --> 806.16
even though i'm actually fully capable

804.24 --> 808.48
of doing that

806.16 --> 809.92
to a serious level

808.48 --> 811.12
but yeah

809.92 --> 815.639
whatever

811.12 --> 815.639
meta skills it's kind of silly

820.56 --> 824.88
out of new names to label shells

826.24 --> 831.199
me as an fed maybe the next turret well

831.36 --> 835.6
i don't think anybody has a problem with

833.36 --> 835.6
that

836.639 --> 840.839
like the least nathan oakley because he

838.88 --> 842.72
knows rv is

840.839 --> 844.9590000000001
just

842.72 --> 844.9590000000001
like

845.44 --> 850.5600000000001
i think some of the guys just have fun

847.6 --> 854.0
memories of rv's videos

850.56 --> 856.4799999999999
because doing what he does relatively

854.0 --> 858.32
unchanging over time he did kind of like

856.48 --> 860.48
shove a whole bunch of information in

858.32 --> 862.5600000000001
people's faces

860.48 --> 864.8000000000001
it's just that the conclusions that he

862.56 --> 867.5999999999999
draws tend to be

864.8 --> 867.5999999999999
a little bit

868.839 --> 872.639
easy

870.639 --> 874.0790000000001
and far-fetched

872.639 --> 875.44
right

874.079 --> 878.3199999999999
but yeah

875.44 --> 881.7600000000001
i mean everybody by now knows like the

878.32 --> 883.6800000000001
saying don't never go full rv

881.76 --> 885.279
because it's just attacking people all

883.68 --> 889.199
the time

885.279 --> 892.24
so if he's now gonna go after fed or end

889.199 --> 895.199
me or just me or whatever like it's like

892.24 --> 897.04
okay dude

895.199 --> 899.199
come here bro

897.04 --> 902.639
do what you think you need to do and

899.199 --> 902.639
i'll do what i need to do

906.16 --> 911.6
i mean you you can all see what i do

909.6 --> 913.279
with the trolls right they just come

911.6 --> 915.1990000000001
wandering in

913.279 --> 918.199
i can do that on the larger scale as

915.199 --> 918.199
well

928.72 --> 931.759
oh my god he's just gonna

930.639 --> 933.6800000000001
oh right

931.759 --> 936.16
yeah i never i didn't think about that

933.68 --> 939.3599999999999
yeah he just might just give me a

936.16 --> 941.8389999999999
numerology numerological analysis and

939.36 --> 941.839
that's it

945.36 --> 950.399
i mean at this point it might be kind of

947.839 --> 954.0400000000001
scary to him to actually try to follow

950.399 --> 954.04
what i talk about

958.0 --> 962.56
so that he's just gonna like oh i'm

960.48 --> 966.399
gonna click a video i'm gonna look at

962.56 --> 968.4799999999999
some numbers in his chat and

966.399 --> 970.399
in the description and that's what i'm

968.48 --> 971.9200000000001
gonna base my presentation of i wouldn't

970.399 --> 975.199
be surprised

971.92 --> 978.0
right i mean actually addressing what i

975.199 --> 980.3199999999999
talk about what i brought to the table

978.0 --> 982.16
well that's a little bit more work isn't

980.32 --> 984.24
it now you actually have to pay

982.16 --> 988.079
attention you can't just do it on

984.24 --> 988.0790000000001
autopilot anymore can you

993.57 --> 996.6690000000001
[Music]

999.44 --> 1003.6
all rv has to do is find my email and

1002.32 --> 1005.44
right it's there

1003.6 --> 1008.24
it's right there it's the first line in

1005.44 --> 1011.24
the description box of every early bird

1008.24 --> 1011.24
video

1020.88 --> 1026.079
i and i made a stance on 33 it's like

1024.4 --> 1028.3190000000002
yeah

1026.079 --> 1031.039
there's something about it and i think

1028.319 --> 1034.1599999999999
it's been taken

1031.039 --> 1036.64
they took it and grafted it into their

1034.16 --> 1036.64
system

1036.72 --> 1042.16
a weird

1039.039 --> 1042.959
godless occultism

1042.16 --> 1045.039
and

1042.959 --> 1048.88
i'm just claiming it back i'm just

1045.039 --> 1051.12
saying like yeah oh the darkness thinks

1048.88 --> 1053.44
that we're all gonna be fooled when they

1051.12 --> 1056.7199999999998
take something and then say ah see this

1053.44 --> 1058.24
is ours if this that means it's evil

1056.72 --> 1059.52
like uh

1058.24 --> 1061.36
no

1059.52 --> 1062.16
no i'm not gonna fall for that trick

1061.36 --> 1063.6789999999999
yeah

1062.16 --> 1066.559
darkness

1063.679 --> 1068.72
loves to take things

1066.559 --> 1070.799
that are magical

1068.72 --> 1073.679
and people don't understand why and then

1070.799 --> 1075.52
just parade around it defile it and then

1073.679 --> 1076.5590000000002
suddenly everybody thinks that that is

1075.52 --> 1079.6
evil

1076.559 --> 1082.08
yeah i'm not gonna fall for that trick

1079.6 --> 1083.9189999999999
you're not going to take

1082.08 --> 1086.32
more symbols

1083.919 --> 1086.3200000000002
away

1087.76 --> 1093.2
i reclaim them

1090.48 --> 1096.559
yeah i'm not afraid anymore

1093.2 --> 1096.559
fear is your power

1099.76 --> 1103.08
not mine

1116.33 --> 1119.47
[Music]

1119.52 --> 1123.72
hello by the way flatter sage

1140.559 --> 1144.36
yes matthew hall

1153.94 --> 1157.009
[Music]

1162.4 --> 1165.679
oh you're surprised about that about

1164.559 --> 1168.24
youtube

1165.679 --> 1172.0800000000002
territory we all know youtube just goes

1168.24 --> 1172.08
around though does whatever he wants

1174.96 --> 1180.72
he doesn't really seem to want to attune

1177.28 --> 1182.6399999999999
to a very specific frequency

1180.72 --> 1187.88
right

1182.64 --> 1187.88
it just does goes wherever it feels like

1195.39 --> 1200.3200000000002
[Music]

1197.679 --> 1200.3200000000002
hey clutch

1202.08 --> 1205.3999999999999
jeff gassett

1206.48 --> 1212.1200000000001
and yeah slo-mo moon buggy was here too

1208.64 --> 1212.1200000000001
by the way hello

1227.919 --> 1233.2
still man youtube was just measuring

1231.039 --> 1234.72
messing around yeah but it probably was

1233.2 --> 1237.3600000000001
terrible 306.

1234.72 --> 1239.6000000000001
as i said he just does whatever he feels

1237.36 --> 1239.6
like

1240.88 --> 1245.44
that's what it has been

1243.12 --> 1248.08
looking like to me in like the last

1245.44 --> 1249.8400000000001
several years that i saw him in chats

1248.08 --> 1253.6399999999999
and all that

1249.84 --> 1253.6399999999999
that's just what he does

1278.0 --> 1282.24
folks in the fb chat that fell for the

1280.159 --> 1284.88
rvs well there's a whole bunch of people

1282.24 --> 1286.4
slow mo moon buggy

1284.88 --> 1287.679
there's a whole bunch of people that are

1286.4 --> 1290.4
falling for that

1287.679 --> 1293.44
right it is a trap it is like the whole

1290.4 --> 1296.64
numerology thing

1293.44 --> 1298.88
and especially the way rv applies it

1296.64 --> 1303.72
is to basically just drive people

1298.88 --> 1303.72
paranoid because of symbols

1304.4 --> 1308.64
even though yeah we deal with numbers

1307.44 --> 1310.4
all the time

1308.64 --> 1312.0800000000002
and guess what's going to happen like

1310.4 --> 1315.1200000000001
throughout

1312.08 --> 1318.799
numerological values

1315.12 --> 1320.08
those numbers are going to return a lot

1318.799 --> 1322.08
like

1320.08 --> 1326.8799999999999
how many threes

1322.08 --> 1326.8799999999999
are there between zero and a thousand

1327.12 --> 1333.12
like every number just just start

1329.44 --> 1337.2
counting how many times

1333.12 --> 1339.9189999999999
you'll you'll bump into a three

1337.2 --> 1342.64
or multiple threes like a lot

1339.919 --> 1345.3600000000001
right so it like what's the point

1342.64 --> 1348.4
it's all like it's one out of the ten or

1345.36 --> 1348.3999999999999
something right

1350.64 --> 1354.88
it it's just

1352.48 --> 1357.28
what's the point it's like looking for

1354.88 --> 1360.96
that thing that you know you'll find and

1357.28 --> 1363.2
attributing this heavy value to it is

1360.96 --> 1363.2
why

1363.52 --> 1367.12
it just seems very distracting

1368.72 --> 1373.64
one eyewearness spiraling what

1384.28 --> 1387.339
[Music]

1394.88 --> 1399.679
according to rv all numerology and

1397.039 --> 1401.36
symbols are evil

1399.679 --> 1403.8400000000001
cool

1401.36 --> 1405.6
so

1403.84 --> 1407.52
well then that would kind of make him

1405.6 --> 1409.76
evil

1407.52 --> 1411.6
because he's obsessed with it

1409.76 --> 1413.6
yeah

1411.6 --> 1418.32
and if you're looking for evil

1413.6 --> 1418.32
everywhere and evil is on your mind

1419.2 --> 1425.88
what happens to those types of people

1422.88 --> 1425.88
logically

1430.72 --> 1433.6000000000001
they become

1432.0 --> 1437.12
the evil

1433.6 --> 1437.12
they sought out to fight

1441.12 --> 1445.279
when

1442.84 --> 1447.6789999999999
yeah like why

1445.279 --> 1449.36
is something your enemy right because

1447.679 --> 1450.3200000000002
there's something wrong about it if you

1449.36 --> 1452.3999999999999
then

1450.32 --> 1454.6399999999999
obsess over the wrong

1452.4 --> 1456.0
and you have that wrong on your mind all

1454.64 --> 1457.5200000000002
the time

1456.0 --> 1460.799
you know what's gonna happen

1457.52 --> 1460.799
you're gonna lose track

1460.88 --> 1464.48
why why you were doing it in the first

1462.799 --> 1467.52
place and you're gonna come become

1464.48 --> 1469.3600000000001
obsessed with it and basically

1467.52 --> 1470.48
manifest it

1469.36 --> 1472.1589999999999
seed

1470.48 --> 1474.08
it

1472.159 --> 1477.7600000000002
and the fear of it

1474.08 --> 1477.76
so you're going to create evil then

1478.48 --> 1484.32
like how are you helping people to avoid

1482.159 --> 1487.2
this

1484.32 --> 1490.3999999999999
integrated evil from symbols by just

1487.2 --> 1493.8400000000001
making everybody paranoid what what are

1490.4 --> 1496.0800000000002
you gonna suggest let's change

1493.84 --> 1498.24
the numerological system let's like

1496.08 --> 1501.039
remove all threes

1498.24 --> 1503.84
or something like like nothing about it

1501.039 --> 1505.679
makes sense it's not tannable

1503.84 --> 1508.1589999999999
it's nothing you can effectively do

1505.679 --> 1508.159
about it

1508.24 --> 1510.4
so

1510.48 --> 1512.88
why

1513.2 --> 1517.8400000000001
unless you're actually you want the

1515.76 --> 1519.6
power for yourself you want that power

1517.84 --> 1522.08
you think is evil

1519.6 --> 1524.1589999999999
for yourself and then you become evil

1522.08 --> 1526.8799999999999
and you act evil

1524.159 --> 1529.5200000000002
and you spread fear

1526.88 --> 1534.5200000000002
hmm

1529.52 --> 1534.52
seems like spiritual corruption to me

1555.44 --> 1560.0
it's the only effie channel you watch oh

1557.76 --> 1563.039
really clutch okay cool

1560.0 --> 1563.039
i'm glad you enjoy it

1563.2 --> 1565.919
you don't know who these other people

1564.799 --> 1568.4
are well

1565.919 --> 1569.76
i can explain it somewhat right because

1568.4 --> 1572.48
a lot of people

1569.76 --> 1575.6
are prominent right they have a big

1572.48 --> 1577.919
influence on the escape and on basically

1575.6 --> 1580.6399999999999
people that go out and watch videos

1577.919 --> 1583.279
about flatter

1580.64 --> 1586.24
right so eric dube is pretty prominent

1583.279 --> 1590.0
he's he was like yeah one of the

1586.24 --> 1592.72
first waivers and he made a lot of work

1590.0 --> 1593.919
he also caused a lot of infighting

1592.72 --> 1594.96
right

1593.919 --> 1597.6000000000001
but

1594.96 --> 1600.4
he cannot top the infighting

1597.6 --> 1602.7199999999998
aspect when it comes to rv another

1600.4 --> 1605.76
person

1602.72 --> 1608.88
that has made significantly less

1605.76 --> 1610.559
constructive contributions to the flat

1608.88 --> 1613.279
earth lore

1610.559 --> 1616.799
and only mainly focused on infighting

1613.279 --> 1616.799
and on sowing paranoia

1617.919 --> 1623.8400000000001
but yeah he has been going around and he

1620.559 --> 1625.52
has like caught interesting ideas out of

1623.84 --> 1627.52
there and basically

1625.52 --> 1628.48
brought that to the table for the flat

1627.52 --> 1632.4
earth

1628.48 --> 1632.4
like he's pretty much the person that

1633.039 --> 1639.12
moved no trees on flat earth

1636.72 --> 1641.52
concept onto the scene

1639.12 --> 1643.76
that's what i remember at least it was

1641.52 --> 1646.08
pretty much on that

1643.76 --> 1648.799
and even though it's not

1646.08 --> 1651.84
it's still just a concept

1648.799 --> 1654.559
it was very stimulating and it did open

1651.84 --> 1658.559
my mind to basically look on a bigger

1654.559 --> 1659.6
scale at things with concealment

1658.559 --> 1662.96
so

1659.6 --> 1665.6
but then yeah that can that the no trees

1662.96 --> 1667.2
on flat earth affect

1665.6 --> 1668.6399999999999
if you don't know what you're doing you

1667.2 --> 1670.0800000000002
don't know how to manage yourself

1668.64 --> 1672.96
properly

1670.08 --> 1674.799
then you can turn in that guy

1672.96 --> 1677.279
that's literally obsessed with

1674.799 --> 1680.72
fantasizing about how everything he

1677.279 --> 1683.76
looks at is actually in his mind once

1680.72 --> 1685.2
some glorious architecture and it is all

1683.76 --> 1687.6
melted

1685.2 --> 1690.559
and that's why they're mountains right

1687.6 --> 1693.1999999999998
that's what the no trees effect does to

1690.559 --> 1695.279
you if you have no grip on yourself

1693.2 --> 1698.799
then you'll just fantasize you'll just

1695.279 --> 1699.84
be trapped in this it may amazing fairy

1698.799 --> 1702.24
tale

1699.84 --> 1705.9189999999999
of what it could have once been

1702.24 --> 1709.039
get that when i was a teen i had that

1705.919 --> 1710.96
sort of dream all the time i wasn't i

1709.039 --> 1713.2
just wasn't stuck at it

1710.96 --> 1715.1200000000001
it was dynamic

1713.2 --> 1717.279
and i was fantasizing in all kinds of

1715.12 --> 1719.1999999999998
bizarre directions sometimes i was just

1717.279 --> 1721.2
pretty free doing it i wasn't just like

1719.2 --> 1724.48
oh it is this

1721.2 --> 1727.6000000000001
and now i can't unsee it i can

1724.48 --> 1727.6
definitely unsee it

1734.799 --> 1739.48
this is uncensored fb channel

1740.48 --> 1744.64
i'm censorship

1743.12 --> 1747.84
what

1744.64 --> 1750.88
do i censor things i i mean i do sense a

1747.84 --> 1754.1589999999999
certain type of behavior and all that

1750.88 --> 1756.3200000000002
but i i use my own principles and guide

1754.159 --> 1758.0
for that i don't standardize right i

1756.32 --> 1760.1589999999999
don't

1758.0 --> 1763.6
adapt what i do

1760.159 --> 1763.6000000000001
like to on purpose

1764.08 --> 1769.48
stay close to like what is natural to me

1775.94 --> 1780.0990000000002
[Music]

1784.97 --> 1788.65
[Music]

1793.52 --> 1798.96
right anyway thank you for the

1794.799 --> 1803.72
compliment clutch i appreciate that

1798.96 --> 1803.72
i i do do my best right

1814.08 --> 1818.12
jackdaw taking a bath

1825.84 --> 1829.76
but yeah terry you're gonna have to

1827.76 --> 1833.2
explain to me exactly what

1829.76 --> 1836.919
censored means in that context though

1833.2 --> 1836.919
what do you mean censored

1843.039 --> 1850.36
why doesn't anyone talk about the

1844.96 --> 1850.3600000000001
thinned the thin sky what

1856.48 --> 1863.519
the sun appears in my location it is and

1860.399 --> 1863.5189999999998
it's said what

1863.679 --> 1868.48
no no the sun isn't actually anywhere

1866.32 --> 1871.36
but it might appear

1868.48 --> 1875.279
or line up

1871.36 --> 1876.7199999999998
seemingly line up at that distance

1875.279 --> 1880.399
what you say

1876.72 --> 1880.3990000000001
and it isn't actually there though

1887.2 --> 1889.519
what

1891.36 --> 1898.24
this guy is at a narrow non-zero angle

1896.32 --> 1900.399
what

1898.24 --> 1902.72
what does that mean

1900.399 --> 1902.7199999999998
what

1904.96 --> 1908.32
what are you talking about wrath

1916.72 --> 1922.64
oh is it really terrible i don't fear

1920.24 --> 1923.76
youtube keywords that get my channel

1922.64 --> 1927.3600000000001
banned

1923.76 --> 1927.36
well in the past i kinda did

1927.76 --> 1932.399
it's just that general policy

1931.2 --> 1936.44
[ __ ] that

1932.399 --> 1936.4399999999998
it's [ __ ] it's self-destructive

1936.96 --> 1940.0
i'm going to be

1938.32 --> 1942.96
the best i can

1940.0 --> 1945.679
and do things morally right and proper

1942.96 --> 1948.08
by my own vision which is

1945.679 --> 1949.6000000000001
the only real reliable thing you can go

1948.08 --> 1951.6
with

1949.6 --> 1954.7199999999998
right in these crazy times with the

1951.6 --> 1956.08
crazy corporate influence i mean i

1954.72 --> 1958.0
i think

1956.08 --> 1960.72
probably a whole bunch of youtube

1958.0 --> 1962.32
workers that are like moderated they

1960.72 --> 1963.679
probably don't even agree with the

1962.32 --> 1965.76
policy

1963.679 --> 1968.24
it's just a bunch of arrogant pieces of

1965.76 --> 1969.84
[ __ ] that just threw those orders at

1968.24 --> 1971.679
them

1969.84 --> 1973.76
right

1971.679 --> 1974.96
i hope so at least

1973.76 --> 1977.84
so

1974.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
i don't know

1981.039 --> 1985.84
i mean i'm not constantly groveling

1983.6 --> 1988.7199999999998
right

1985.84 --> 1991.279
i don't want to just like oh

1988.72 --> 1994.08
this is the ultimate forbidden thing so

1991.279 --> 1996.559
i'm going to do it now until i get back

1994.08 --> 1998.96
no i got better things to do

1996.559 --> 2001.6
i want the freedom i actually want the

1998.96 --> 2005.1200000000001
freedom and dynamics

2001.6 --> 2009.279
but i can basically also promise that i

2005.12 --> 2012.2399999999998
will not just waste it and be like

2009.279 --> 2015.44
i'm a bad boy i can do whatever i want

2012.24 --> 2018.0
and just be a dick or something no i

2015.44 --> 2021.6000000000001
need that freedom

2018.0 --> 2021.6
to be able to do what i do

2021.76 --> 2023.6
and

2022.48 --> 2027.039
perhaps

2023.6 --> 2028.6399999999999
unspoken unspokenly that is the reason

2027.039 --> 2031.039
why they don't

2028.64 --> 2033.519
crush down on me all the time because i

2031.039 --> 2035.84
do yield i do actually

2033.519 --> 2039.519
produce

2035.84 --> 2042.48
it's spiritual it's communicatory

2039.519 --> 2044.88
but i do actually do something with that

2042.48 --> 2046.64
freedom and not just be like oh i'm a

2044.88 --> 2047.679
rebel rouser and

2046.64 --> 2050.639
man

2047.679 --> 2052.079
i'm gonna sit on this

2050.639 --> 2055.04
on this tower

2052.079 --> 2056.2400000000002
of defiance i don't do that i don't even

2055.04 --> 2058.399
like that

2056.24 --> 2061.6789999999996
anymore

2058.399 --> 2064.24
right not to move like to establishment

2061.679 --> 2066.399
or anything i mean to

2064.24 --> 2069.6789999999996
when it comes to like

2066.399 --> 2072.72
intergroup dynamics then i might do that

2069.679 --> 2075.839
i'll just be a bit of a taunter

2072.72 --> 2075.839
to elicit a response

2076.079 --> 2080.32
but i don't typically like doing that

2080.639 --> 2084.639
right

2081.76 --> 2087.44
i'm not actually that rebellious

2084.639 --> 2089.679
i'm oppositionally defiant but i'm not

2087.44 --> 2092.32
really rebellious

2089.679 --> 2095.04
that sounds self-contradictory anyway

2092.32 --> 2095.04
but it isn't

2096.56 --> 2100.48
because why do i have to take the

2098.72 --> 2102.48
opposition

2100.48 --> 2104.32
because that's what works

2102.48 --> 2109.4
i'm like

2104.32 --> 2109.4
oppositionally defined out of pragmatism

2116.0 --> 2118.32
anyway

2118.56 --> 2123.119
you think i just learned about euclidean

2121.2 --> 2126.1189999999997
three space

2123.119 --> 2126.119
what

2134.079 --> 2138.6800000000003
euclidean threes you mean reality

2154.8 --> 2159.04
that's blocking the view now but it's

2157.28 --> 2162.96
not that's the wrong terminology the

2159.04 --> 2162.96
other andrew it's not blocking the view

2164.8 --> 2168.32
the view becomes

2167.44 --> 2170.079
like

2168.32 --> 2171.44
too compacted

2170.079 --> 2174.32
to be

2171.44 --> 2174.32
visible to you

2175.359 --> 2179.44
blocking

2176.72 --> 2182.3999999999996
suggests is by the nature of the word

2179.44 --> 2184.96
suggests a geometry obstruction of some

2182.4 --> 2187.44
kind it's not blocked when things move

2184.96 --> 2188.48
into the horizon

2187.44 --> 2191.119
they just

2188.48 --> 2192.88
get in there they

2191.119 --> 2195.52
they fold

2192.88 --> 2197.359
out of view they just

2195.52 --> 2200.359
they don't get blocked they are

2197.359 --> 2200.359
concealed

2201.28 --> 2206.7200000000003
blocking suggests

2203.119 --> 2208.32
see this is blocked by the other thing

2206.72 --> 2210.8799999999997
that suggests

2208.32 --> 2213.04
like geometry

2210.88 --> 2216.32
naturally it does that and so it's not

2213.04 --> 2216.32
blocked it's concealed

2217.44 --> 2224.2000000000003
compressed however you want to describe

2220.0 --> 2224.2
but it's not literally blocked

2228.88 --> 2232.7200000000003
i mean just because the lights not

2230.72 --> 2236.0
reaching you doesn't mean it's

2232.72 --> 2236.0
physically obstructed

2239.359 --> 2242.359
anyway

2269.28 --> 2274.079
yeah yeah seeking style yeah that is

2271.76 --> 2277.2000000000003
that is the gist of it that is

2274.079 --> 2281.3590000000004
the gist that that's the basics

2277.2 --> 2281.359
angle of view vanishing point

2281.599 --> 2285.079
where's your horizon

2286.16 --> 2290.8799999999997
and basically how tilted is the view on

2289.28 --> 2294.28
what you're

2290.88 --> 2294.28
going to draw

2322.32 --> 2325.32
man

2332.24 --> 2337.52
i just got a weird painting idea that's

2334.88 --> 2340.32
a long time ago since i last came up

2337.52 --> 2342.32
with that

2340.32 --> 2343.92
i wonder if it's gonna sit in there and

2342.32 --> 2347.599
then come out later on because i

2343.92 --> 2351.16
definitely don't feel like painting

2347.599 --> 2351.1600000000003
anytime soon

2358.0 --> 2362.72
but yeah you could do a bunch of surreal

2360.8 --> 2364.96
stuff with

2362.72 --> 2366.7999999999997
basically mixing in

2364.96 --> 2368.56
perspective and vanishing point it would

2366.8 --> 2371.04
be like grafting in different

2368.56 --> 2372.96
perspectives

2371.04 --> 2375.2
different things

2372.96 --> 2377.119
and then grafting them in one another

2375.2 --> 2379.359
but in a way

2377.119 --> 2380.4
that when you just look at the point it

2379.359 --> 2384.48
could

2380.4 --> 2384.48
mechanically transition but

2384.56 --> 2389.7599999999998
if you put it all together it's complete

2386.72 --> 2392.3199999999997
non nonsense like the perspective just

2389.76 --> 2394.5600000000004
nothing makes sense that way but anyway

2392.32 --> 2396.88
yeah this

2394.56 --> 2400.16
hmm

2396.88 --> 2400.1600000000003
who knows what you could do with that

2405.04 --> 2411.2799999999997
it would be like sort of like asher but

2409.28 --> 2413.6800000000003
less cohesive

2411.28 --> 2416.7200000000003
more trippy you might get a headache

2413.68 --> 2416.72
from the end result

2417.52 --> 2422.5
i don't know i've never actually tried

2419.599 --> 2425.699
it

2422.5 --> 2425.699
[Music]

2437.359 --> 2444.72
so when the sun sets and is blocked by

2441.28 --> 2444.7200000000003
the heart it's not blocked

2446.319 --> 2449.2799999999997
it's not blocked

2449.839 --> 2455.839
it falls in to the horizon just like

2453.68 --> 2459.44
everything else does

2455.839 --> 2461.92
there's no physical obstruction

2459.44 --> 2464.8
and the sun is not an object so

2461.92 --> 2468.079
it's an appearance it's a hologram

2464.8 --> 2471.119
you could very easily say and you would

2468.079 --> 2474.7200000000003
be correct that the horizon that we see

2471.119 --> 2477.44
is also an optical phenomenon so there

2474.72 --> 2478.839
you go celestial light

2477.44 --> 2481.92
apparent

2478.839 --> 2482.72
thing horizon

2481.92 --> 2484.48
both

2482.72 --> 2487.52
optical phenomena

2484.48 --> 2489.2
and they seem to be compatible

2487.52 --> 2491.359
so yeah

2489.2 --> 2493.4399999999996
the horizon can

2491.359 --> 2497.04
also fold

2493.44 --> 2500.4
celestial lights within it

2497.04 --> 2500.4
it's not blocking it though

2507.28 --> 2512.7200000000003
right there's no behind the horizon

2509.839 --> 2515.52
there's no underneath the horizon

2512.72 --> 2517.839
it's just that's the point where

2515.52 --> 2521.72
the holograms of the celestial lights

2517.839 --> 2521.72
are no longer visible

2537.44 --> 2541.68
eyes no longer able to separate but yeah

2539.599 --> 2543.76
right that's yeah seeking star wars

2541.68 --> 2545.7599999999998
that's part of it

2543.76 --> 2548.0
so that's part of why the horizon is

2545.76 --> 2548.0
there

2549.2 --> 2555.04
it's how the light is resolved because

2551.52 --> 2555.04
of the architecture of your eye

2555.76 --> 2560.4
and optical mediums in general cameras

2558.72 --> 2561.9199999999996
too

2560.4 --> 2564.92
right they have a higher resolution

2561.92 --> 2564.92
though

2581.92 --> 2587.599
the horizon is arisen too blocked if you

2584.56 --> 2587.599
yeah but it isn't

2587.839 --> 2591.0789999999997
it's flat

2592.4 --> 2595.04
you just

2593.359 --> 2597.839
everything

2595.04 --> 2600.64
to you the viewer becomes

2597.839 --> 2605.64
closer together seemingly smaller and

2600.64 --> 2605.64
then it just kind of like folds

2608.8 --> 2614.0
right the optical slant effects let me

2611.599 --> 2616.4
show it again i i drew it like four

2614.0 --> 2618.88
years ago

2616.4 --> 2621.839
i just as well show it again

2618.88 --> 2621.839
why not

2640.56 --> 2644.319
all right so this is

2643.359 --> 2646.7999999999997
not

2644.319 --> 2648.48
euclidean oh [ __ ] i've clicked it away

2646.8 --> 2651.44
oops

2648.48 --> 2654.68
it's not euclidean mechanism

2651.44 --> 2654.68
come on

2662.8 --> 2667.04
there you go

2664.56 --> 2669.92
this is not a euclidean description this

2667.04 --> 2672.72
is effectively an autographic view

2669.92 --> 2677.4
but it's not claiming like linearity the

2672.72 --> 2677.3999999999996
purpose of the diagram is descriptory

2677.44 --> 2680.88
it's to

2678.96 --> 2684.96
help you assist

2680.88 --> 2688.7200000000003
to basically take a third position

2684.96 --> 2691.7200000000003
to see what is happening with what you

2688.72 --> 2691.72
see

2693.04 --> 2698.48
folds together comes smaller then you

2695.839 --> 2699.44
get an optical slant effect that's also

2698.48 --> 2702.2400000000002
where

2699.44 --> 2704.8
things may start seem

2702.24 --> 2706.16
to be disappearing bottom up

2704.8 --> 2708.7200000000003
it's part of that

2706.16 --> 2711.68
right but it's not actually

2708.72 --> 2714.319
behind something physically

2711.68 --> 2716.24
it's concealed

2714.319 --> 2718.96
because of the optical slant effect and

2716.24 --> 2720.64
then eventually it'll all just blur out

2718.96 --> 2724.2400000000002
aside

2720.64 --> 2727.04
a big gray soup or white soup

2724.24 --> 2728.9599999999996
and you won't be able to see anything

2727.04 --> 2731.04
because of yeah the blur up and that's

2728.96 --> 2733.44
all because there's always going to be

2731.04 --> 2736.0
an end of sight

2733.44 --> 2738.079
some point

2736.0 --> 2740.319
where you just can't make out what it is

2738.079 --> 2744.52
anymore

2740.319 --> 2744.52
like nothing would be able to

2761.92 --> 2764.2400000000002
right

2768.56 --> 2775.0789999999997
it's my old optical slant diagram hope

2771.839 --> 2775.0789999999997
that helps

2787.92 --> 2793.16
it just appears to rise that's right

2789.839 --> 2793.16
other andrew

2827.359 --> 2834.24
we only see the horizontal reflection

2830.16 --> 2837.24
near the non-zero angle sunrise sunset

2834.24 --> 2837.24
what

2850.079 --> 2856.559
i i don't know how to put that

2853.44 --> 2856.559
in in the frame

2856.72 --> 2862.0789999999997
because

2857.599 --> 2864.4
look to me sun the sun is not an object

2862.079 --> 2867.04
we're not dealing with perspective in

2864.4 --> 2869.52
relation to the sun ever

2867.04 --> 2871.2
i mean you can see it like on the

2869.52 --> 2873.7599999999998
horizon

2871.2 --> 2876.64
and it would be right there you see it's

2873.76 --> 2879.119
like oh man it's it's like touching it

2876.64 --> 2880.4
it's like touching it right well then

2879.119 --> 2881.599
good luck

2880.4 --> 2884.4
you can go

2881.599 --> 2886.1600000000003
perfectly flat in a straight line

2884.4 --> 2887.599
right towards the point where you think

2886.16 --> 2889.1189999999997
it's going down

2887.599 --> 2892.4
if you do it with a lot of speed you'll

2889.119 --> 2893.92
get on like a speedboat or something

2892.4 --> 2895.92
right when it's at the ocean and you go

2893.92 --> 2898.559
straight at it and you go for like an

2895.92 --> 2901.839
hour and like really as fast as you can

2898.559 --> 2901.8390000000004
guess what's going to happen

2904.559 --> 2910.4
it's not actually there

2907.52 --> 2912.8
like it isn't anywhere the sun isn't

2910.4 --> 2915.92
physically anywhere

2912.8 --> 2917.52
there's only an apparition at an angular

2915.92 --> 2920.16
relation

2917.52 --> 2921.68
to the observer it's not a thing in a

2920.16 --> 2923.839
place

2921.68 --> 2925.839
over earth

2923.839 --> 2930.0
and it's very confusing it's very

2925.839 --> 2934.24
surreal it's very suggestive to the mind

2930.0 --> 2937.359
so if you're not hyper dynamic with like

2934.24 --> 2939.04
surreal mechanics basically

2937.359 --> 2941.359
if you're not good at that then it's

2939.04 --> 2943.2
constantly going to confuse you like

2941.359 --> 2945.92
potentially

2943.2 --> 2947.2799999999997
mandela effect related influence like

2945.92 --> 2950.2400000000002
like but

2947.28 --> 2953.8390000000004
you just can't unsee it like an object

2950.24 --> 2956.72
it has to be an object there

2953.839 --> 2958.48
that happens to people it's not like i

2956.72 --> 2959.9599999999996
think it's funny when that happens to

2958.48 --> 2962.48
people it's

2959.96 --> 2966.16
physicality-assumptious bias

2962.48 --> 2966.16
it's really hard to let go

2967.04 --> 2972.16
i've trained myself to do that for years

2969.92 --> 2972.16
now

2976.96 --> 2979.839
thank you anyway

2980.48 --> 2984.76
check this out what's that

2986.48 --> 2991.119
beyond conventional imagination

2991.48 --> 2996.52
polarized sensor what

3006.24 --> 3009.24
oh

3012.559 --> 3017.119
wow

3014.8 --> 3017.119
okay

3018.319 --> 3020.5589999999997
huh

3021.119 --> 3024.599
that's weird

3032.319 --> 3037.2
oh look at the lights represented as a

3034.8 --> 3037.2000000000003
wave

3037.44 --> 3043.28
it's all a wave really look at the

3039.68 --> 3043.2799999999997
diagram it has to be a wave

3044.8 --> 3052.4
okay uh

3046.24 --> 3054.8799999999997
yeah cute okay so i guess that lens lens

3052.4 --> 3056.319
ability abilities are being expanded

3054.88 --> 3057.44
upon

3056.319 --> 3059.92
cool

3057.44 --> 3059.92
i guess

3066.319 --> 3071.92
it's just the frequency i know

3069.599 --> 3074.559
but if you don't know that then you'll

3071.92 --> 3077.04
be like oh look it's a wave it's a see

3074.559 --> 3078.7200000000003
they they drew it like a wave it has to

3077.04 --> 3081.119
be a wave

3078.72 --> 3082.5589999999997
oh no no it's just a

3081.119 --> 3086.079
a pattern

3082.559 --> 3087.6800000000003
it's just a wave pattern to remind you

3086.079 --> 3092.0
it's a frequency

3087.68 --> 3093.839
and a frequency is a word based on

3092.0 --> 3096.16
patterns that would be associated with

3093.839 --> 3097.839
waves but it's not a wave but it's not

3096.16 --> 3100.64
helping either

3097.839 --> 3101.7599999999998
if you know what i mean

3100.64 --> 3104.8799999999997
i mean

3101.76 --> 3107.92
why not just like a beam

3104.88 --> 3111.92
like an actual beam

3107.92 --> 3112.64
and then i don't know in the beam

3111.92 --> 3115.6800000000003
show

3112.64 --> 3119.359
a sort of wavy pattern

3115.68 --> 3122.0
to represent its frequency or wave

3119.359 --> 3125.52
length it's oh god the words all the

3122.0 --> 3127.8
words wavelength it's like the entire

3125.52 --> 3130.48
light vernacular is just like

3127.8 --> 3132.7200000000003
monstrously hellbound

3130.48 --> 3135.92
to convince everybody it's a wave with

3132.72 --> 3139.359
every single [ __ ] piece of vernacular

3135.92 --> 3142.319
that's associated with it it's monstrous

3139.359 --> 3144.96
like it's made very difficult

3142.319 --> 3147.119
in the english language not to think of

3144.96 --> 3149.92
light as a wave

3147.119 --> 3152.119
you realize that right

3149.92 --> 3155.559
everything related to light is

3152.119 --> 3159.359
constantly suggesting it's a wave

3155.559 --> 3161.6800000000003
constantly with every freaking aspect of

3159.359 --> 3164.24
it it's constantly doing that by the

3161.68 --> 3166.96
very vernacular to describe what it

3164.24 --> 3169.1189999999997
supposedly is

3166.96 --> 3172.4
ah

3169.119 --> 3172.4
so frustrating

3178.72 --> 3184.7599999999998
it's only gonna play into more ether

3181.04 --> 3184.7599999999998
hysteria really

3186.23 --> 3189.36
[Music]

3197.52 --> 3202.4
seeing light is a wave but what do you

3200.079 --> 3206.319
think of the doubles flick is

3202.4 --> 3206.319
the double split experiment

3206.839 --> 3214.64
uh i think there's a diffraction cascade

3210.88 --> 3217.28
effect yeah there's an effect

3214.64 --> 3218.96
there is there is an effect

3217.28 --> 3222.8
effect is that oh

3218.96 --> 3225.52
light has a very weird ability if you

3222.8 --> 3228.4
shine it fast

3225.52 --> 3230.319
like through a little space

3228.4 --> 3232.2400000000002
tiny tiny space

3230.319 --> 3233.7599999999998
or two tiny spaces

3232.24 --> 3236.5589999999997
then suddenly

3233.76 --> 3239.0400000000004
a diffraction cascade that's the word

3236.559 --> 3240.6400000000003
that i literally conjured up to describe

3239.04 --> 3242.319
it as an alternative because the

3240.64 --> 3245.1189999999997
original is just

3242.319 --> 3247.44
so it means a wave it's way way you know

3245.119 --> 3249.119
it's diffraction cascade you know why i

3247.44 --> 3252.2400000000002
call it that because the fraction

3249.119 --> 3255.28
happens it happens with material too

3252.24 --> 3258.0789999999997
except material doesn't split up in more

3255.28 --> 3262.7200000000003
than three bands

3258.079 --> 3262.7200000000003
light does light splits up in

3262.96 --> 3268.88
potentially infinite amount depending on

3265.52 --> 3270.64
the intensity of the light

3268.88 --> 3273.28
10 times

3270.64 --> 3275.839
15 times it all depends

3273.28 --> 3278.1600000000003
but it's the same thing except all

3275.839 --> 3279.839
matter doesn't really split up in more

3278.16 --> 3282.48
than three bands

3279.839 --> 3284.96
light splits up in a whole bunch

3282.48 --> 3286.2400000000002
what the what does that signify a

3284.96 --> 3289.44
cascade

3286.24 --> 3292.319
it's the same thing diffraction

3289.44 --> 3294.079
a cascade that's unique to light that's

3292.319 --> 3296.0
the effect that's where the

3294.079 --> 3297.52
misassumption of light being a wave

3296.0 --> 3299.68
comes from

3297.52 --> 3302.24
that it splits up the diffraction

3299.68 --> 3305.2
cascade oh look the way it splits up

3302.24 --> 3308.319
it's almost like it's a wave conjunction

3305.2 --> 3312.72
and then a wave wave

3308.319 --> 3315.119
it's a wave no it's diffraction cascade

3312.72 --> 3318.839
all those pieces of light hitting the

3315.119 --> 3323.76
wall all went in a perfect straight

3318.839 --> 3327.24
line making it not a wave

3323.76 --> 3327.2400000000002
there you go

3337.22 --> 3340.37
[Music]

3345.78 --> 3351.2000000000003
[Music]

3348.079 --> 3355.04
we never see the refracted vertical

3351.2 --> 3357.7599999999998
aspect of light only the horizontal

3355.04 --> 3357.7599999999998
reflection

3357.839 --> 3363.64
what

3359.839 --> 3363.64
what are you talking about

3375.68 --> 3379.68
dude

3377.839 --> 3383.92
i'm not following what you're talking

3379.68 --> 3383.9199999999996
about wrath i'm not following at all

3384.68 --> 3388.24
polarization filter

3388.72 --> 3393.2
no

3389.599 --> 3393.2000000000003
it's about a double slit

3394.0 --> 3396.64
and

3395.04 --> 3398.88
like it works

3396.64 --> 3402.64
not just with very specific type of

3398.88 --> 3405.44
light it works with all light you see

3402.64 --> 3408.24
including non-laser light non-laser

3405.44 --> 3412.64
light also diffract

3408.24 --> 3415.52
diffraction it shows diffraction cascade

3412.64 --> 3415.52
it's all light

3416.16 --> 3420.24
wrath

3417.76 --> 3422.1600000000003
it's not a polarization filter that's

3420.24 --> 3424.5589999999997
not part of the

3422.16 --> 3427.92
the thing that's

3424.559 --> 3431.2000000000003
yeah that is causing the effect

3427.92 --> 3432.88
take the time and study the link

3431.2 --> 3435.5989999999997
okay

3432.88 --> 3439.599
just so you know i have studied this

3435.599 --> 3441.839
stuff very intensely because i thought

3439.599 --> 3444.1600000000003
this is something i can actually find

3441.839 --> 3446.4
something new and i've done it for like

3444.16 --> 3447.839
six years

3446.4 --> 3450.2400000000002
right that's how i came up with the

3447.839 --> 3453.04
diffraction cascade that's how i figured

3450.24 --> 3455.5989999999997
out the optical slant graph

3453.04 --> 3458.5589999999997
it's how i came up with the

3455.599 --> 3461.599
potential experiment to prove light is

3458.559 --> 3465.119
an infinitely divisible beam

3461.599 --> 3468.96
by taking several argon lasers and

3465.119 --> 3471.119
having them fire off less than a photon

3468.96 --> 3473.52
quanta amount of light

3471.119 --> 3476.079
at the same photoelectric plate in the

3473.52 --> 3478.72
exact same spot to see

3476.079 --> 3482.1600000000003
if there would still be a response

3478.72 --> 3484.64
from separated less than one photon

3482.16 --> 3485.52
quanta amounts of light

3484.64 --> 3487.2799999999997
yeah

3485.52 --> 3489.04
i've been busy

3487.28 --> 3491.52
i've been very busy i've been talking

3489.04 --> 3493.2
about this also for a while including

3491.52 --> 3495.2
behind the scenes

3493.2 --> 3497.359
i pretty much know

3495.2 --> 3500.72
everything there's to know that would be

3497.359 --> 3503.52
going around about it

3500.72 --> 3507.2799999999997
yeah that includes kiwi

3503.52 --> 3510.0
i might not know all the mathematical

3507.28 --> 3511.44
secondary stuff and all this reference

3510.0 --> 3513.76
to what this

3511.44 --> 3516.799
what feynman did here and there i don't

3513.76 --> 3518.88
know all those details but i know enough

3516.799 --> 3521.04
i know enough but i'm very clear and i'm

3518.88 --> 3525.48
deadly serious about trying to figure

3521.04 --> 3525.48
this out it's part of my life's work

3532.24 --> 3539.799
biff tenon

3534.96 --> 3539.799
make like a tree and get out of here

3553.599 --> 3556.599
anyway

3557.22 --> 3560.3199999999997
[Music]

3568.48 --> 3573.839
right but yeah sure i might read up a

3571.04 --> 3573.839
little on

3575.599 --> 3580.6400000000003
on the article

3576.96 --> 3583.839
some of the graphs do seem interesting

3580.64 --> 3586.799
but it mostly just seems about

3583.839 --> 3588.319
just breaking and unbreaking light

3586.799 --> 3590.559
splitting it up

3588.319 --> 3590.5589999999997
right

3591.359 --> 3595.52
that's what

3592.4 --> 3598.559
what i can get on the surface from what

3595.52 --> 3598.559
what is being shown

3599.28 --> 3605.92
it doesn't change anything about the

3601.92 --> 3605.92
very nature of light though

3606.24 --> 3610.2799999999997
it

3606.96 --> 3610.28
it's interesting

3623.2 --> 3627.0
yes wrath

3639.599 --> 3646.079
i mean not understanding the full

3642.64 --> 3648.64
phrase horizontal baseline reality

3646.079 --> 3650.48
but if you mean like yeah the horizon is

3648.64 --> 3652.4
flat

3650.48 --> 3654.48
it's the same height everywhere if

3652.4 --> 3657.48
that's what that emphasizes yeah of

3654.48 --> 3657.48
course

3720.4 --> 3722.1600000000003
yeah

3720.93 --> 3724.24
[Music]

3722.16 --> 3726.48
i appreciate

3724.24 --> 3729.0389999999998
your enthusiasm though digging into this

3726.48 --> 3731.44
sort of stuff it's all very complicated

3729.039 --> 3733.119
though so

3731.44 --> 3734.88
just be careful

3733.119 --> 3738.079
like always keep comparing keep

3734.88 --> 3741.039
comparing realize like oh am i

3738.079 --> 3743.6800000000003
in this enthusiastic moment trying to

3741.039 --> 3745.119
figure it out am i all sharp

3743.68 --> 3747.68
like

3745.119 --> 3750.6400000000003
how much is my actual grasp on this

3747.68 --> 3755.2799999999997
insight that i've attained in the moment

3750.64 --> 3758.0
and be honest and trust like oh

3755.28 --> 3760.3190000000004
if it seems that it's not as cohesive as

3758.0 --> 3762.24
i felt then

3760.319 --> 3766.4
being honest about that and taking a

3762.24 --> 3768.9599999999996
step back doesn't mean it all goes away

3766.4 --> 3772.559
it is actually it gives you a better

3768.96 --> 3773.599
opportunity to then after a point step

3772.559 --> 3777.2000000000003
back

3773.599 --> 3777.2000000000003
and find a better footing

3782.96 --> 3786.88
i do it all the time

3784.72 --> 3788.16
but at the same time i'm also like i

3786.88 --> 3790.799
have this

3788.16 --> 3793.68
process that i really don't like to be

3790.799 --> 3796.48
fundamentally wrong about things

3793.68 --> 3798.72
so i kind of have to go through this

3796.48 --> 3801.599
process of having

3798.72 --> 3803.0389999999998
i guess vetted it before i start to

3801.599 --> 3804.559
throw it out

3803.039 --> 3806.96
as a

3804.559 --> 3811.799
fresh concept

3806.96 --> 3811.799
this is all purely intuitive purely

3819.119 --> 3824.119
it comes to water hydrostatic

3821.119 --> 3824.119
equilibrium

3825.2 --> 3831.0389999999998
is an even altitude or atmospheric

3828.48 --> 3834.359
pressure that ensures water at rest will

3831.039 --> 3834.3590000000004
lie horizontal

3845.119 --> 3848.7200000000003
good question but no

3848.96 --> 3853.799
very tintillating to think about that

3850.799 --> 3853.799
yeah

3854.16 --> 3858.48
look

3855.039 --> 3862.48
the stable pressure in the system

3858.48 --> 3865.039
is what enables water to basically

3862.48 --> 3867.28
be at rest there was no pressure then

3865.039 --> 3870.2400000000002
water would never be at rest because if

3867.28 --> 3872.7200000000003
the pressure dynamic changes

3870.24 --> 3874.799
then everything about water changes the

3872.72 --> 3876.0
boiling point changes

3874.799 --> 3876.799
right

3876.0 --> 3879.52
if

3876.799 --> 3880.48
anything about it changes it yeah it

3879.52 --> 3882.319
maneuvers

3880.48 --> 3885.119
starts to find in equilibrium with the

3882.319 --> 3886.5589999999997
surrounding in this case pressure

3885.119 --> 3888.2400000000002
it's going to be moving it's not going

3886.559 --> 3890.48
to be at rest

3888.24 --> 3890.4799999999996
right

3890.72 --> 3892.8799999999997
so

3893.44 --> 3899.039
the pressure stability

3895.92 --> 3900.079
of the contained system is what ensures

3899.039 --> 3902.4
water

3900.079 --> 3904.2400000000002
at rest will lie horizontal

3902.4 --> 3909.0
if that is what you were

3904.24 --> 3909.0
implying then i totally agree

3924.88 --> 3928.839
all right all right

3936.0 --> 3940.559
but it is really like this this

3937.839 --> 3942.799
stability of the pressure system that

3940.559 --> 3944.96
allows that right because if it's not

3942.799 --> 3950.559
stable the water is constantly going to

3944.96 --> 3953.28
be moving bubbling all kinds of things

3950.559 --> 3957.599
yeah and when hey when water is bubbling

3953.28 --> 3957.599
it's not really at rest now is it

3961.44 --> 3965.839
right and just look at the oceans they

3963.599 --> 3966.7200000000003
are barely at rest because there's so

3965.839 --> 3968.64
much

3966.72 --> 3969.9199999999996
influence there's so much

3968.64 --> 3972.16
temperature

3969.92 --> 3974.4
constant influences

3972.16 --> 3977.2
from all sides the heat

3974.4 --> 3980.079
from the surface and cool

3977.2 --> 3983.1189999999997
water streams from colder regions it's

3980.079 --> 3985.76
just all moving all the time

3983.119 --> 3987.44
so yeah it's not fully at rest and how

3985.76 --> 3989.92
is it because of that it's just always

3987.44 --> 3992.48
going winds blowing

3989.92 --> 3994.4
here and there

3992.48 --> 3997.039
it's not really at rest

3994.4 --> 3999.28
still on average

3997.039 --> 4001.2000000000003
on average

3999.28 --> 4004.88
it's gonna pan out

4001.2 --> 4007.0389999999998
as a geometric flat oriented

4004.88 --> 4009.28
plane

4007.039 --> 4011.92
with a lot of unevenness and all that

4009.28 --> 4014.4
[ __ ] but the average is still gonna be

4011.92 --> 4014.4
flat

4014.48 --> 4019.4
yeah

4015.68 --> 4019.3999999999996
still gonna be flat

4020.559 --> 4026.2400000000002
because if it weren't then it will find

4023.599 --> 4028.7200000000003
its equilibrium if there is a oh there's

4026.24 --> 4030.8799999999997
a hump here and not there guess what

4028.72 --> 4034.72
it's going to do it's going to want to

4030.88 --> 4036.88
move in to equalize it right whether it

4034.72 --> 4038.16
is all restless and there's a hump over

4036.88 --> 4040.0
there

4038.16 --> 4042.24
or whether it isn't restless and there's

4040.0 --> 4044.16
a hump over there it's going to try to

4042.24 --> 4049.24
equalize

4044.16 --> 4049.24
right water wants to be flat

4056.319 --> 4061.2799999999997
water doesn't curve because air doesn't

4058.16 --> 4061.2799999999997
curve what no

4061.44 --> 4063.839
what

4064.96 --> 4069.28
now water doesn't

4066.64 --> 4072.0789999999997
water does kind of curve on a small

4069.28 --> 4075.119
scale i have to be honest about that

4072.079 --> 4077.599
there's a scale thing with water

4075.119 --> 4080.96
like

4077.599 --> 4083.52
a droplet is round it's because water

4080.96 --> 4086.0
also has surface tension intermolecular

4083.52 --> 4086.0
bonds

4086.16 --> 4091.68
that

4087.76 --> 4094.0
pull it toward each other it's

4091.68 --> 4095.52
not mass attracting mass it's water

4094.0 --> 4098.56
attracting water

4095.52 --> 4101.12
it will pull itself

4098.56 --> 4103.279
into an ideal shape where everything has

4101.12 --> 4105.92
the shortest distance toward each other

4103.279 --> 4107.1990000000005
but at the same time it still does have

4105.92 --> 4110.2390000000005
mass

4107.199 --> 4113.3589999999995
because it's a liquid

4110.239 --> 4115.2789999999995
and that will also be responding to the

4113.359 --> 4116.96
medium surrounding it will which will be

4115.279 --> 4120.2390000000005
air which will probably be lighter of

4116.96 --> 4123.52
course so it's also if it's big enough

4120.239 --> 4124.718999999999
it's going to want to go down

4123.52 --> 4126.719
because it's

4124.719 --> 4129.199
denser than the air that's around it and

4126.719 --> 4130.4800000000005
that makes it not a perfect

4129.199 --> 4132.48
sphere

4130.48 --> 4133.599999999999
right so there's this balance between

4132.48 --> 4135.759
water

4133.6 --> 4138.400000000001
surface attraction

4135.759 --> 4139.679
making it into round droplets

4138.4 --> 4142.3189999999995
and

4139.679 --> 4145.679
relative density disequilibrium in the

4142.319 --> 4146.400000000001
medium of not water

4145.679 --> 4147.979
like

4146.4 --> 4151.1089999999995
pulling it black

4147.979 --> 4151.109
[Music]

4151.839 --> 4155.44
or pushing it flat rather because the

4153.759 --> 4160.199
this equilibrium force of relative

4155.44 --> 4160.199
density is basically always a push

4177.6 --> 4181.359
but air doesn't curve that's right

4183.12 --> 4185.44
air

4185.679 --> 4190.08
doesn't have mass

4187.6 --> 4192.319
because it's surrounded

4190.08 --> 4195.36
by

4192.319 --> 4197.679
like a singular isolated piece of gas is

4195.36 --> 4201.12
going to be surrounded by pretty much

4197.679 --> 4202.56
the same pieces of gas surrounding it

4201.12 --> 4205.28
so there's not going to be a

4202.56 --> 4208.4800000000005
disequilibrium force because the

4205.28 --> 4210.5599999999995
the relative density ratio

4208.48 --> 4213.28
is zero

4210.56 --> 4213.280000000001
it's neutral

4213.52 --> 4219.040000000001
but gas will still try to find pressure

4217.12 --> 4220.4
equilibrium

4219.04 --> 4221.6
right

4220.4 --> 4222.48
air

4221.6 --> 4224.96
gas

4222.48 --> 4226.5599999999995
responds to local air pressure

4224.96 --> 4229.36
differential

4226.56 --> 4232.96
the pressure is slightly less

4229.36 --> 4236.0
here than it is here it will immediately

4232.96 --> 4238.56
try to locally equalize

4236.0 --> 4240.32
right that's why you feel

4238.56 --> 4241.360000000001
a piece of wind

4240.32 --> 4244.0
when you

4241.36 --> 4246.159
move your hand like that you feel the

4244.0 --> 4247.76
local air pressure building up in front

4246.159 --> 4249.599999999999
of your hand

4247.76 --> 4251.52
equalizing with the surrounding the

4249.6 --> 4252.96
vacuum in the back of your hand slight

4251.52 --> 4255.6
vacuum

4252.96 --> 4258.4
it's going to try to maneuver around it

4255.6 --> 4260.719
constantly

4258.4 --> 4263.759999999999
in order to equalize the local air

4260.719 --> 4263.76
pressure differential

4270.239 --> 4273.799999999999
what's that wrath

4285.84 --> 4291.76
with mechanisms

4288.4 --> 4294.159
oh this looks like a full lecture

4291.76 --> 4296.64
interesting

4294.159 --> 4299.12
who's that guy this is an older lecture

4296.64 --> 4302.159000000001
this could be good

4299.12 --> 4302.159
not seeing a name

4310.4 --> 4315.0
wait that's this is like his channel

4322.48 --> 4325.48
okay

4329.76 --> 4335.52
yeah that's still like a 50-minute long

4333.84 --> 4338.159000000001
presentation

4335.52 --> 4341.400000000001
chemistry looks very interesting i love

4338.159 --> 4341.4
that [ __ ]

4346.4 --> 4349.599999999999
but yeah i'm not gonna actually go to

4348.56 --> 4351.4400000000005
that

4349.6 --> 4353.84
moment in the video can you describe it

4351.44 --> 4353.839999999999
to me

4354.48 --> 4357.839999999999
or at least paraphrase

4359.74 --> 4368.5199999999995
[Music]

4374.239 --> 4378.08
no wrath i don't want a timestamp i want

4376.8 --> 4379.76
you

4378.08 --> 4383.04
to paraphrase

4379.76 --> 4384.4800000000005
when it is you wanted me to

4383.04 --> 4388.04
know about that

4384.48 --> 4388.04
that would be better

4400.719 --> 4406.08
all right i'm hope you're i hope you

4402.32 --> 4406.08
guys are all enjoying the show by the

4410.84 --> 4417.6
way in a very physics oriented show this

4414.719 --> 4417.6
time and it's good

4418.159 --> 4422.92
you do need that every now and then

4426.0 --> 4430.48
water level demonstration based on

4428.0 --> 4432.8
pressure okay

4430.48 --> 4436.599999999999
do three minutes

4432.8 --> 4436.6
it's almost in the end

4458.239 --> 4463.839999999999
oh okay it's the water tube test that's

4461.44 --> 4466.08
it yeah

4463.84 --> 4468.2390000000005
dude that's that's just the water tube

4466.08 --> 4470.159
test

4468.239 --> 4471.678999999999
yeah it happens

4470.159 --> 4475.719
you have a tube

4471.679 --> 4475.719
ah there's a show link

4483.04 --> 4486.64
yeah

4483.92 --> 4490.2390000000005
i had the water tube test demonstration

4486.64 --> 4491.84
in my in my physics class too

4490.239 --> 4494.239
hydrostatic

4491.84 --> 4497.04
equilibrium it's just a pressure

4494.239 --> 4498.639999999999
equilibrium

4497.04 --> 4500.64
right water

4498.64 --> 4502.56
still going to be at this equilibrium

4500.64 --> 4504.64
with the medium that surrounds it in

4502.56 --> 4507.84
this case air

4504.64 --> 4510.8
so it's going to try to find an equal

4507.84 --> 4511.6
division of pressure

4510.8 --> 4514.2390000000005
right

4511.6 --> 4516.159000000001
so it's like this equilibrium and both

4514.239 --> 4518.5599999999995
this equilibrium forces are kind of

4516.159 --> 4520.719
pushing at the same spot

4518.56 --> 4522.88
so it's one this equilibrium force and

4520.719 --> 4524.8
the other trying to find a balance of

4522.88 --> 4528.64
the same substance

4524.8 --> 4528.64
that's what the water tube test is

4530.64 --> 4534.96
right that's by the way not how they

4532.159 --> 4537.679
explain it in school but that is

4534.96 --> 4541.04
how the relative density

4537.679 --> 4543.6
formula applies

4541.04 --> 4545.12
and i always try to translate like these

4543.6 --> 4548.56
types of mechanics now through the

4545.12 --> 4552.599999999999
relative density mechanism

4548.56 --> 4552.6
because that's what i do now

4552.71 --> 4555.789
[Music]

4563.199 --> 4567.599999999999
hydro

4564.84 --> 4570.08
dynamics it's a very fancy word though

4567.6 --> 4572.400000000001
for it's just relative density

4570.08 --> 4572.4
really

4576.239 --> 4580.32
you can explain every part of what's

4578.4 --> 4585.159
happening there in that test with

4580.32 --> 4585.159
relative density perfectly perfectly

4611.44 --> 4616.159
it controls

4613.44 --> 4616.159
the tights

4617.36 --> 4621.88
but wind does have an influence

4622.56 --> 4628.320000000001
but it's not the only influence wrath

4624.64 --> 4630.0
it's not that straightforward look

4628.32 --> 4633.28
the the total

4630.0 --> 4637.36
multiple influences of like what happens

4633.28 --> 4641.28
with the ocean and waves and tights

4637.36 --> 4643.04
it's really complicated actually

4641.28 --> 4646.08
there's like all these different types

4643.04 --> 4648.64
of influence all simultaneously

4646.08 --> 4650.4
and it's just kind of elusive like it

4648.64 --> 4652.320000000001
becomes tricky

4650.4 --> 4654.96
because of all the different variables

4652.32 --> 4657.12
that all play a part

4654.96 --> 4659.6
if one changes dramatically everything

4657.12 --> 4661.44
changes dramatically

4659.6 --> 4663.52
let's hope that doesn't happen and it

4661.44 --> 4666.4
usually doesn't

4663.52 --> 4668.56
right but there's also just the the

4666.4 --> 4671.12
angel spoon effect

4668.56 --> 4673.52
that creates the magnetic tides that's

4671.12 --> 4674.88
also an influence but yes wind is an

4673.52 --> 4678.320000000001
influence

4674.88 --> 4681.12
the heating up of the surface ocean is

4678.32 --> 4684.0
an influence

4681.12 --> 4684.0
the cold

4684.88 --> 4689.92
ocean bottom streams

4687.36 --> 4693.599999999999
from colder territories it's all an

4689.92 --> 4693.6
influence somehow it's

4701.6 --> 4706.400000000001
you can't just pinpoint

4703.84 --> 4709.28
like the entire process down to one

4706.4 --> 4711.12
element it's just you can't doesn't work

4709.28 --> 4713.28
but the other things have an influence

4711.12 --> 4716.0
and we don't even exactly understand

4713.28 --> 4718.32
fully like how it is all balanced like

4716.0 --> 4720.0
that we just know all these things have

4718.32 --> 4722.799999999999
influences

4720.0 --> 4725.28
not perfectly how i mean there might be

4722.8 --> 4729.84
people that are like attempting to build

4725.28 --> 4729.84
like really serious simulators for it

4730.64 --> 4733.64
but

4735.28 --> 4739.92
the chance that they're like really

4737.36 --> 4739.92
perfect

4741.76 --> 4746.159000000001
it's just it's just very complicated

4743.92 --> 4749.4400000000005
it's always been complicated

4746.159 --> 4752.32
so feels dedicated to the study of how

4749.44 --> 4752.32
this all works

4755.84 --> 4761.719
meteorology

4758.719 --> 4761.719
anyway

4772.48 --> 4775.48
fifty

4785.04 --> 4789.76
hydrodynamics thermodynamics

4787.679 --> 4792.0
thermal haline

4789.76 --> 4794.719
circular what

4792.0 --> 4796.159
dude are you reading some techno site

4794.719 --> 4798.159
because you're throwing all these words

4796.159 --> 4800.879999999999
at me that i've never

4798.159 --> 4800.879999999999
heard before

4801.04 --> 4805.56
no haline what is that

4809.84 --> 4813.12
i'm you

4810.88 --> 4814.08
well you're a bit hyperactive in chat

4813.12 --> 4818.36
wrath

4814.08 --> 4818.36
i think everybody else is just listening

4818.48 --> 4823.5599999999995
hello psych bear by the way and george

4820.56 --> 4823.56
sanford

4836.44 --> 4839.669999999999
[Music]

4878.4 --> 4883.679
ring tides are high because of the

4880.48 --> 4883.678999999999
arrival of hate

4885.92 --> 4889.92
i

4887.52 --> 4892.719
aren't the tides even higher with the

4889.92 --> 4894.719
arrival of more heat in the summer

4892.719 --> 4896.88
ah

4894.719 --> 4899.76
well that's a good one

4896.88 --> 4901.6
i can answer that tamar stone

4899.76 --> 4904.639
because there's a limitation to the

4901.6 --> 4907.1990000000005
amount that it actually expands

4904.639 --> 4908.96
right at some point it's not gonna

4907.199 --> 4912.5599999999995
expand

4908.96 --> 4912.56
it's just gonna evaporate

4913.199 --> 4919.5199999999995
right so from like cold state to warming

4917.44 --> 4921.678999999999
up state is one thing

4919.52 --> 4924.2390000000005
and if it warms up even more then it's

4921.679 --> 4929.8
just gonna evaporate it's not gonna

4924.239 --> 4929.799999999999
actually start like being that hot

4936.48 --> 4942.12
right it's about range there's just a

4938.48 --> 4942.12
range to it

4963.36 --> 4968.0
dude where you get

4965.6 --> 4969.92
are you getting this off

4968.0 --> 4971.76
looks like you're like open up some kind

4969.92 --> 4973.6
of physics book or something you're

4971.76 --> 4977.12
throwing all these terminologies that

4973.6 --> 4977.120000000001
i've literally never heard before

4985.44 --> 4991.36
salt changes density yeah for sure

4989.28 --> 4994.159
and not just the density

4991.36 --> 4996.48
it also changes

4994.159 --> 4996.48
uh

4997.6 --> 5002.08
conductivity

4999.12 --> 5004.96
electric conductivity and it changes

5002.08 --> 5006.0
evaporation rate yeah if there's salt in

5004.96 --> 5008.88
water

5006.0 --> 5013.04
it will boil quicker

5008.88 --> 5015.679
it's very important factor like it will

5013.04 --> 5019.12
lower the threshold

5015.679 --> 5022.719
effectively for evaporation that's very

5019.12 --> 5024.239
critical to know influence that salt has

5022.719 --> 5025.92
on water and by the way it's not just

5024.239 --> 5028.48
salt

5025.92 --> 5031.679
it's not just table salts all kinds of

5028.48 --> 5033.919999999999
stuff if you dilute water

5031.679 --> 5038.2390000000005
with stuff that does mix in if it's like

5033.92 --> 5038.2390000000005
oilation it does it's like hydro

5040.48 --> 5046.239
what do you call that again that it that

5043.04 --> 5046.239
it repulses water

5048.32 --> 5052.08
something hydro

5049.76 --> 5053.6
like it doesn't like hydro like if it

5052.08 --> 5056.239
repulses water then it doesn't do

5053.6 --> 5058.88
anything but if it dissolves in water

5056.239 --> 5061.36
then if you put stuff in water to

5058.88 --> 5063.4400000000005
dissolve not just like a bucket of sand

5061.36 --> 5065.12
because it doesn't dissolve

5063.44 --> 5066.4
the water dilutes

5065.12 --> 5069.04
because you put stuff in it that

5066.4 --> 5071.679
dissolves in it like salt

5069.04 --> 5074.8
then the evaporation

5071.679 --> 5077.04
rate will also like the the level where

5074.8 --> 5079.6
that starts

5077.04 --> 5081.199
within the temperature range becomes

5079.6 --> 5083.6
lower

5081.199 --> 5085.678999999999
water will literally start to evaporate

5083.6 --> 5087.120000000001
quicker when there's more

5085.679 --> 5090.32
stuff in it

5087.12 --> 5091.12
saturated within the water

5090.32 --> 5093.759999999999
yeah

5091.12 --> 5096.08
this is a fact

5093.76 --> 5098.159000000001
it's a chemistry fact

5096.08 --> 5100.159
it's very important to also take into

5098.159 --> 5102.638999999999
account see and that's why

5100.159 --> 5104.96
all of the material it's not that oh

5102.639 --> 5107.04
it's so super simple you just put this

5104.96 --> 5109.679
and that yeah but what about all these

5107.04 --> 5111.84
like every freaking aspect in there is

5109.679 --> 5113.84
all influenced by like four different

5111.84 --> 5115.6
things at the same time and if one

5113.84 --> 5117.92
changes they all slightly change it's

5115.6 --> 5120.719
like yeah

5117.92 --> 5123.36
it's complicated

5120.719 --> 5124.96
that's why it's complicated

5123.36 --> 5126.5599999999995
himalayan

5124.96 --> 5129.679
any sort of salt

5126.56 --> 5129.679
then winfield hello

5130.159 --> 5133.04
hold on chips

5133.36 --> 5137.08
right okay

5146.88 --> 5151.1990000000005
i've never heard of the terminology hey

5148.8 --> 5155.159000000001
line before

5151.199 --> 5155.159
i'm gonna google it

5159.76 --> 5165.04
salty saline okay it is official word i

5162.8 --> 5165.04
guess

5165.44 --> 5171.44
funny it isn't just salt it's salt tea

5169.679 --> 5175.04
so it isn't like

5171.44 --> 5177.12
a line is salt no it is salty that's

5175.04 --> 5178.32
funny

5177.12 --> 5182.239
objective

5178.32 --> 5184.799999999999
so haline is like another word for salty

5182.239 --> 5184.799999999999
interesting

5185.199 --> 5187.759999999999
weird

5186.48 --> 5191.4
but i guess

5187.76 --> 5191.400000000001
that's how it works

5210.96 --> 5216.639
water in salt form evaporates what are

5213.76 --> 5216.639
you talking about

5217.679 --> 5223.32
that doesn't make any sense what is salt

5220.32 --> 5223.32
form

5224.159 --> 5226.4
what

5229.52 --> 5232.88
dude dan winfield

5234.159 --> 5240.638999999999
don't do that and don't don't

5237.04 --> 5240.639
don't tell people to do that

5241.12 --> 5245.199
yeah

5242.719 --> 5247.28
animal torture is not

5245.199 --> 5249.199
oh look an interesting experiment no

5247.28 --> 5252.679
it's just horrific

5249.199 --> 5252.678999999999
don't do that

5280.52 --> 5283.679
[Music]

5281.76 --> 5287.04
circulation

5283.679 --> 5287.04
jeez wrath you're like

5290.4 --> 5294.36
like on fire today

5294.639 --> 5298.04
what's that

5321.12 --> 5323.84
hmm

5339.28 --> 5344.8
what would it be called if you used

5341.52 --> 5347.8
light to explain euclidean space

5344.8 --> 5347.8
what

5351.04 --> 5353.84
what does that mean

5355.199 --> 5358.4
i mean

5356.159 --> 5362.4
euclidean space is

5358.4 --> 5365.5199999999995
that's about volumetrics it's about

5362.4 --> 5369.199
like how it is out there light is simply

5365.52 --> 5369.1990000000005
something that happens within it

5370.0 --> 5376.0
right you can't

5372.639 --> 5376.0
demonstrate light

5376.56 --> 5382.080000000001
outside of euclidean space

5379.28 --> 5384.96
all the light that we get to see we we

5382.08 --> 5386.48
can bet our bottom dollar that is all

5384.96 --> 5389.6
within

5386.48 --> 5395.199
the confine of the realm

5389.6 --> 5398.400000000001
whatever it may appear like to us right

5395.199 --> 5401.919999999999
i mean oh look oh we might someday reach

5398.4 --> 5404.08
the dome or the end or whatever and it's

5401.92 --> 5406.639
like oh but look the sun it's right out

5404.08 --> 5408.32
there outside it's outside of the door

5406.639 --> 5410.88
no

5408.32 --> 5412.88
there's nothing outside of it

5410.88 --> 5414.96
all the light that we can demonstrate

5412.88 --> 5417.52
that we can figure out we all see it

5414.96 --> 5417.52
within

5417.76 --> 5422.719
the space in which matter resides

5421.76 --> 5425.679
even

5422.719 --> 5427.199
if we evacuate that space

5425.679 --> 5429.679
that doesn't seem to matter it doesn't

5427.199 --> 5431.678999999999
seem to matter how thick the material is

5429.679 --> 5432.84
within the space in order for us to

5431.679 --> 5436.0
perceive

5432.84 --> 5437.76
light all the light that we see

5436.0 --> 5440.96
is present within

5437.76 --> 5443.92
3d euclidean space

5440.96 --> 5446.84
because that's the only place where we

5443.92 --> 5449.76
can actually perceive

5446.84 --> 5452.159000000001
things so to suggest that it would exist

5449.76 --> 5454.2390000000005
outside you yeah you

5452.159 --> 5456.638999999999
it's just fantasy again it's just like

5454.239 --> 5458.879999999999
pseudo-romanian four space oh the fourth

5456.639 --> 5460.719
dimension of light it's super cool you

5458.88 --> 5463.12
know it is sort of mathematical

5460.719 --> 5465.04
curiosity way

5463.12 --> 5465.92
when it comes to practical reality

5465.04 --> 5467.84
though

5465.92 --> 5470.4800000000005
yeah

5467.84 --> 5472.56
all these higher mathematical dimensions

5470.48 --> 5476.32
it's all super cute

5472.56 --> 5479.1990000000005
but we deal with the 3d euclidean

5476.32 --> 5479.199
root world so

5479.36 --> 5481.679
you know

5481.92 --> 5487.36
it's not really relevant

5485.12 --> 5489.04
whatever light might be in the fourth

5487.36 --> 5491.04
dimension

5489.04 --> 5493.28
and i mean to me it's very appealing

5491.04 --> 5496.239
that i did because like yeah how else am

5493.28 --> 5497.92
i gonna try to find some kind of origin

5496.239 --> 5500.4
effect

5497.92 --> 5502.719
for the the holographic celestial lights

5500.4 --> 5504.4
that are non-local

5502.719 --> 5506.56
and like

5504.4 --> 5507.839999999999
yeah fourth dimension kind of seems like

5506.56 --> 5510.2390000000005
yeah well

5507.84 --> 5511.1990000000005
it's there somehow

5510.239 --> 5512.159
so

5511.199 --> 5514.159
how

5512.159 --> 5516.0
well maybe in a fourth dimension sure

5514.159 --> 5518.159
the problem is though that you can't

5516.0 --> 5520.56
prove that in the third dimension not

5518.159 --> 5520.5599999999995
really

5521.36 --> 5523.599999999999
so

5527.6 --> 5533.84
euclidean sounds like an alien species

5530.08 --> 5533.84
no it's the name euclid

5535.12 --> 5540.159
i mean

5536.8 --> 5542.159000000001
just like eugene right

5540.159 --> 5547.599999999999
i mean if the guy was called eugene it

5542.159 --> 5549.839999999999
would now be you eugenian space

5547.6 --> 5554.120000000001
the guy was called euclid

5549.84 --> 5554.12
so it's euclidean space

5570.46 --> 5577.28
[Music]

5573.12 --> 5577.28
geometer what are you talking about

5579.199 --> 5583.839999999999
eugene invented eugenics maybe

5582.239 --> 5586.239
i don't know

5583.84 --> 5588.08
did he was that actually a guy called

5586.239 --> 5590.159
eugene

5588.08 --> 5591.84
i don't know man i don't want to really

5590.159 --> 5593.679
talk about that now

5591.84 --> 5596.159000000001
we're

5593.679 --> 5600.76
going so well with all the physics don't

5596.159 --> 5600.759999999999
want to spoil the mood all of a sudden

5602.159 --> 5605.28
what creates light

5605.52 --> 5607.76
uh

5608.159 --> 5613.159
electricity

5609.92 --> 5613.159
and combustion

5618.639 --> 5624.0
like chemical reactions

5621.36 --> 5624.0
cause light

5624.32 --> 5630.5599999999995
and things being electrified

5628.84 --> 5633.1990000000005
also

5630.56 --> 5636.84
generates like

5633.199 --> 5636.839999999999
so there's your costs

5657.28 --> 5661.36
proofs with euclidean geometry are

5659.28 --> 5662.5599999999995
universally true well i wouldn't go that

5661.36 --> 5664.719
far

5662.56 --> 5667.04
but at least it's palpable right when

5664.719 --> 5670.2390000000005
it's euclidean or it has euclidean

5667.04 --> 5672.719
geometry that means it's actually in the

5670.239 --> 5674.4
real world if it's non-euclidean

5672.719 --> 5676.88
geometry

5674.4 --> 5680.96
that automatically tells you

5676.88 --> 5684.32
it's in the other place that is not our

5680.96 --> 5687.28
3d euclidean reality so that means it's

5684.32 --> 5689.04
unprovable you can only

5687.28 --> 5691.04
calculate it

5689.04 --> 5693.28
right just like pseudo-ramone in four

5691.04 --> 5695.84
space that doesn't make everything that

5693.28 --> 5698.639
has a euclidean geometry universally

5695.84 --> 5701.6
true it just means

5698.639 --> 5704.96
it could be feasible

5701.6 --> 5706.02
because it's within the actual world

5704.96 --> 5707.6
that's the difference

5706.02 --> 5710.400000000001
[Music]

5707.6 --> 5711.4400000000005
doesn't automatically make it true

5710.4 --> 5713.0
whatever

5711.44 --> 5715.599999999999
it is

5713.0 --> 5717.74
[Music]

5715.6 --> 5725.359

5717.74 --> 5725.3589999999995

5746.56 --> 5751.52
dude

5747.44 --> 5751.5199999999995
i don't know what that means

5753.04 --> 5757.84
from school

5755.199 --> 5757.839999999999
do

5758.639 --> 5762.96
i mean

5760.719 --> 5765.04
try cohesive sentence

5762.96 --> 5768.8
and then we'll talk but you're a bit

5765.04 --> 5768.8
late because i'm gonna run out the show

5768.84 --> 5773.28
sorry

5770.48 --> 5774.879999999999
so yeah thanks everyone for coming

5773.28 --> 5778.639
i thought it was a really good show

5774.88 --> 5781.6
myself very physics and i like that all

5778.639 --> 5783.119
physics so i'm going to give it a proper

5781.6 --> 5787.119000000001
physics title if you have any

5783.119 --> 5788.4
suggestions let me know in

5787.119 --> 5792.88
in the chat

5788.4 --> 5797.04
for as long as the show is rounding out

5792.88 --> 5798.88
right anyway if you liked it as well

5797.04 --> 5801.119
then please don't forget to rogan's it

5798.88 --> 5802.32
up and if you haven't already subscribe

5801.119 --> 5804.5599999999995
to my channel and hit the bell

5802.32 --> 5807.199
notification so you know when i'm going

5804.56 --> 5809.360000000001
live which is normally 1 p.m amsterdam

5807.199 --> 5810.719
time in the weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam

5809.36 --> 5812.96
time in the weekend

5810.719 --> 5814.8
please also do support me through the

5812.96 --> 5817.04
paypal patreon super chat and the

5814.8 --> 5819.76
membership system join button they'll be

5817.04 --> 5823.04
much appreciated and always use it

5819.76 --> 5825.76
please do keep it coming

5823.04 --> 5827.84
right i'll be back tomorrow with flat

5825.76 --> 5832.2390000000005
earth early bird number twelve hundred

5827.84 --> 5834.400000000001
and thirty four one two three four

5832.239 --> 5837.36
only i could have an episode one two

5834.4 --> 5838.879999999999
three four five

5837.36 --> 5841.839999999999
that's the

5838.88 --> 5844.0
security guard on my lunchbox

5841.84 --> 5846.56
yeah but i'm afraid i'm gonna have to

5844.0 --> 5850.32
like do the early bird show another

5846.56 --> 5851.6
15 years before i get there

5850.32 --> 5853.04
right

5851.6 --> 5854.400000000001
so anyway

5853.04 --> 5857.199
i'm also going to join the flat earth

5854.4 --> 5859.44
debates on nathan oakley 9080 channel it

5857.199 --> 5861.04
should start up any second now hope to

5859.44 --> 5866.21
see you there

5861.04 --> 5897.51
and until the next video keep it flat

5866.21 --> 5897.51
