[Music]

48.2 --> 54.079

button

79.6 --> 84.64
they'll be much appreciated

82.32 --> 84.63999999999999
right

84.84 --> 89.759
starting almost an hour late

88.479 --> 91.439
woke up

89.759 --> 93.43900000000001
late

91.439 --> 98.24
right and yeah i think

93.439 --> 101.119
i'm just gonna declare that this week

98.24 --> 103.52
i'm gonna do my show around 2 p.m

101.119 --> 105.92
even in the weekdays because this keeps

103.52 --> 107.28
on happening i seem to really need my

105.92 --> 112.0
sleep

107.28 --> 114.399
anyway the weather today is cloudy

112.0 --> 116.079
rainy it's not raining at this very

114.399 --> 118.88
moment but it has been pretty much the

116.079 --> 121.67999999999999
entire night it's still wet out there

118.88 --> 124.079
clouds up there are rushing by very

121.68 --> 124.07900000000001
quickly

126.88 --> 130.0
it's not cold though

130.16 --> 134.72
like that really stood out in the night

132.64 --> 136.48
that

134.72 --> 139.76
i had to

136.48 --> 139.76
the cold nights

140.0 --> 144.0
keep my windows closed a lot because it

142.08 --> 147.44000000000003
would just get too cold but yeah that

144.0 --> 149.76
didn't happen now but it did get moist

147.44 --> 151.68
all right so hello pj crew shank first

149.76 --> 155.72
in chat

151.68 --> 155.72
weather's crap there also

163.2 --> 166.879
right so yeah i got

167.36 --> 172.31900000000002
i

168.8 --> 172.31900000000002
took another coffee again

176.319 --> 182.23899999999998
yeah i just did

180.159 --> 185.67999999999998
not entirely sure about it though

182.239 --> 190.0
because i'm not used to it anymore

185.68 --> 190.0
but yeah i feel different today

190.239 --> 195.36
maybe like that underbelly tension i've

192.879 --> 197.12
been having is moving on

195.36 --> 200.8
because that was really the thing that

197.12 --> 200.8
stopped me from getting the coffees

202.08 --> 207.44000000000003
and yeah now i don't know i wake up and

204.72 --> 211.56
i feel much more slow

207.44 --> 211.56
it's been happening for a while

212.72 --> 216.64
but yeah even yesterday i started up

214.56 --> 219.12
kind of slow but then

216.64 --> 221.44
as the show progressed sadly

219.12 --> 226.20000000000002
like i really wake up

221.44 --> 226.2
i wish i had that right straight away

227.599 --> 234.35999999999999
all right hello jeff

229.76 --> 234.35999999999999
gas head mike sadoo niche

248.799 --> 253.439
right

250.159 --> 256.15999999999997
but yeah but the reason like i've almost

253.439 --> 258.0
been feeling like maybe i should just

256.16 --> 259.84000000000003
halt the show for a while i mean

258.0 --> 262.24
nathan's been kind of

259.84 --> 263.59999999999997
telling me for a while but maybe i

262.24 --> 265.36
should do

263.6 --> 266.88
because

265.36 --> 269.759
yeah when i'm

266.88 --> 273.68
in the chats of other people's dreams

269.759 --> 277.52000000000004
i got like a lot of inspiration like

273.68 --> 277.52
super focused inspiration

278.08 --> 282.4
and just these things start rolling out

280.24 --> 284.56
of me and it works great

282.4 --> 286.56
but on my own show

284.56 --> 289.6
yeah

286.56 --> 289.6
it's much rarer

291.36 --> 297.04
but i do have memories of shows where i

294.16 --> 298.96000000000004
am like that constantly those are good

297.04 --> 302.0
shows

298.96 --> 305.52
just very sharp focused quick

302.0 --> 308.32
no long silent pause no waiting on

305.52 --> 311.75899999999996
not feeling perfectly well

308.32 --> 313.44
and i never have that in anybody's chat

311.759 --> 316.24
like i don't get

313.44 --> 318.8
that kind of a physical obstruction

316.24 --> 322.40000000000003
anywhere else except on my own show and

318.8 --> 322.40000000000003
sometimes the flat earth debates

323.039 --> 328.639
then i just don't speak up because i

324.639 --> 328.639
don't have to because it's not my show

336.0 --> 342.08
but yeah i wish i had more of that focus

339.44 --> 345.28
that i have in other people's chats

342.08 --> 347.84
when i do my own show

345.28 --> 350.32
because that would make for much better

347.84 --> 352.479
shows on average

350.32 --> 354.0
and not so many kind of like waiting

352.479 --> 355.68
hanging around

354.0 --> 358.0
parts

355.68 --> 360.24
which i find very annoying that i have

358.0 --> 361.28
that

360.24 --> 363.12
like

361.28 --> 365.59999999999997
having knowledge of that

363.12 --> 368.24
is probably still a negative influence

365.6 --> 370.319
on how people regard my show in general

368.24 --> 372.0
because i think a lot of people know

370.319 --> 374.72
yeah are win

372.0 --> 376.479
some super bright moments

374.72 --> 378.47900000000004
but

376.479 --> 379.75899999999996
yeah you have to kind of dig through the

378.479 --> 382.71999999999997
dirt

379.759 --> 385.039
of him not really saying too much or if

382.72 --> 387.28000000000003
you talking about how he's sick again or

385.039 --> 389.52
something right and that must get

387.28 --> 392.88
annoying

389.52 --> 395.28
still doing it because it's honest

392.88 --> 396.8
because i'm actually trying to lay down

395.28 --> 398.96
a

396.8 --> 401.919
profile

398.96 --> 404.23999999999995
of what's happening to me as i am doing

401.919 --> 404.24
things

406.72 --> 410.40000000000003
anyway hello bad karma

417.199 --> 421.599
maybe it's because in face 65 percent of

419.919 --> 424.15999999999997
top discussed

421.599 --> 426.8
my show is not really yeah but there's

424.16 --> 430.639
bad karma that's also because there is

426.8 --> 430.639
really not much to discuss

430.72 --> 434.56
in the sense that

432.479 --> 437.199
yeah we find

434.56 --> 439.44
technical details

437.199 --> 441.599
which make it a lot bit more difficult

439.44 --> 443.919
for any globers to deal with it

441.599 --> 446.56
so the only way i'm even dealing with

443.919 --> 450.599
flat earth on my show is

446.56 --> 450.599
just kind of having to

451.919 --> 456.79999999999995
deal with squirting ballers and

453.599 --> 458.479
anti-flat earthers and that's it

456.8 --> 459.759
because there's no more real discussion

458.479 --> 463.599
about it

459.759 --> 466.72
like it's it's been over for some time

463.599 --> 469.919
i'll keep entertaining you you know do a

466.72 --> 472.16
cosmetical society

469.919 --> 474.4
right you have a right to talk about it

472.16 --> 479.16
and

474.4 --> 479.15999999999997
the whole space thing should be

479.36 --> 485.599
displayed or shared in a in a

481.919 --> 487.919
technically consistent fashion

485.599 --> 490.24
based on on the parameters that are

487.919 --> 493.84
given for the medium

490.24 --> 493.84000000000003
right that's something i work on

494.4 --> 500.15999999999997
but when it comes to actual

497.68 --> 502.16
debate

500.16 --> 506.36
there's really nothing left

502.16 --> 506.36
it's been like that for a while

510.24 --> 513.76
all right now of course i got my own

512.159 --> 516.24
conceptions

513.76 --> 518.56
that i can talk about and do sometimes

516.24 --> 520.32
but yeah i've been getting

518.56 --> 522.159
last time that happened i got some

520.32 --> 523.839
pushback

522.159 --> 526.0
in a way that it was very hard to

523.839 --> 529.839
stomach for me and i'm kind of like

526.0 --> 529.839
hesitant to even go there now

531.44 --> 535.12
i mean

532.72 --> 536.0
it will always come back

535.12 --> 538.72
like

536.0 --> 541.12
rectangular loop the looping potential

538.72 --> 543.44
looping

541.12 --> 546.0
nature of the realms

543.44 --> 547.9200000000001
available space

546.0 --> 550.64
of course the holographic sun although

547.92 --> 553.519
yeah that's it it is a good subject now

550.64 --> 556.399
it is widely talked about

553.519 --> 558.32
people try to figure it out flat earth a

556.399 --> 560.64
lot of different flowers are in the

558.32 --> 564.72
middle of just trying to get that

560.64 --> 567.36
straight and basically

564.72 --> 570.1600000000001
disconnected from the old assertion

567.36 --> 573.36
pattern the old dichotomy

570.16 --> 574.3199999999999
some are literally over a disk

573.36 --> 577.519
sun

574.32 --> 579.6800000000001
millions and millions of miles away

577.519 --> 581.839
all parallel right that to get

579.68 --> 583.92
themselves loose from that false

581.839 --> 585.2790000000001
dichotomy which it is

583.92 --> 586.16
both

585.279 --> 588.32
with

586.16 --> 591.8389999999999
physicality assumption bias based

588.32 --> 591.839
presuppositions within them

600.72 --> 603.88
all right

610.399 --> 614.88
no no discussion on fe topics

613.839 --> 617.2790000000001
well

614.88 --> 620.0
there's still discussion it's just not

617.279 --> 622.0
my bag of goods right

620.0 --> 625.36
there's a lot of these mathematical

622.0 --> 627.12
technical things and well the guys over

625.36 --> 629.519
at the flat earth debate most of them

627.12 --> 631.279
are really good at it and they like it

629.519 --> 632.64
and they also kind of like bickering

631.279 --> 635.04
about it

632.64 --> 637.519
i don't like that

635.04 --> 640.8
feels like to me

637.519 --> 642.48
like i'm in the math nerds class

640.8 --> 644.24
and that's okay

642.48 --> 646.88
like they're they're doing good they're

644.24 --> 648.72
doing good work it's just not my thing

646.88 --> 651.76
so then i

648.72 --> 652.64
instead while they're doing that

651.76 --> 654.64
am

652.64 --> 656.959
looking in the other places while

654.64 --> 659.12
they're like focusing on the mechanic i

656.959 --> 661.1199999999999
am looking at like hey what is i'm

659.12 --> 664.9590000000001
actually kind of using the situation to

661.12 --> 664.9590000000001
just study everybody and like how

665.279 --> 669.68
feelings and consciousness responds to

667.68 --> 671.76
information in general

669.68 --> 674.079
that's what i end up focusing on a

671.76 --> 675.6
little more and sometimes i pick up

674.079 --> 678.0
something

675.6 --> 680.8000000000001
an interesting detail mechanic

678.0 --> 682.32
and see more about it

680.8 --> 683.76
so that's the kind of thing that i do

682.32 --> 685.839
there

683.76 --> 687.12
but when it gets so mathematical and

685.839 --> 689.2790000000001
detailed

687.12 --> 691.68
it's just kind of it's not my bag of

689.279 --> 691.68
goods

697.44 --> 701.519
that's why i typically when like

699.2 --> 703.839
psychology talk pops up which is of

701.519 --> 706.24
course very much involved the ballers

703.839 --> 708.8000000000001
and anti-flat earth that's when i pipe

706.24 --> 710.32
up because that's my bag of goods the

708.8 --> 712.3199999999999
psychology

710.32 --> 714.1600000000001
i'm very good at doing that and

712.32 --> 717.839
explaining it like

714.16 --> 717.8389999999999
to make it understandable

731.839 --> 735.36
right pg crew shank so you're a bit like

734.0 --> 737.76
that too well there's a whole bunch of

735.36 --> 739.76
people not not everybody's a math geek

737.76 --> 742.0
if you're into flat earth

739.76 --> 742.0
you know

742.56 --> 746.399
a lot of them will be and it's very

744.24 --> 748.88
useful to have them but

746.399 --> 750.88
yeah me

748.88 --> 754.72
not so much

750.88 --> 756.0
i don't think neil is a master

754.72 --> 756.839
oh dear

756.0 --> 759.76
now

756.839 --> 762.1600000000001
neil neil is the

759.76 --> 762.16
heart

763.2 --> 769.44
of the group and that's how he's being

765.6 --> 770.839
treated and and he accepts that

769.44 --> 774.1600000000001
he is there

770.839 --> 776.9590000000001
to to like

774.16 --> 779.92
do the uh thing for the for the feels of

776.959 --> 781.68
the group and to point out the feelings

779.92 --> 783.5999999999999
that's what he's always doing and yeah

781.68 --> 785.12
that gets

783.6 --> 787.6800000000001
very distracting

785.12 --> 790.0
very rambly at times but

787.68 --> 792.6389999999999
i do that in my own way

790.0 --> 794.56
a little more subtle

792.639 --> 796.0
right he does that pretty much

794.56 --> 797.68
exclusively

796.0 --> 798.72
but it has a role

797.68 --> 800.56
because

798.72 --> 803.0400000000001
when everybody's always talking about

800.56 --> 806.88
psychology and math

803.04 --> 806.88
a lot of people kind of freeze up

807.6 --> 813.12
and kneel too like

810.32 --> 815.0400000000001
yeah so you gotta just bring in back

813.12 --> 818.0
some basic feelings and that's what he

815.04 --> 820.7199999999999
does a lot and that's his function

818.0 --> 823.6
in the group dynamic

820.72 --> 824.88
and hey i love neil mann he is really

823.6 --> 826.839
great

824.88 --> 829.6
he's just a bit

826.839 --> 830.399
rowdy and he knows it he's not gonna

829.6 --> 834.24
like

830.399 --> 835.519
always bulldoze over everybody right

834.24 --> 837.6
like some

835.519 --> 841.32
some people would that are like that he

837.6 --> 841.32
doesn't really do that

847.12 --> 852.24
none of the guys on fe debate show is a

849.36 --> 854.48
math that's absolutely incorrect

852.24 --> 860.5600000000001
that bad karma that's just wrong

854.48 --> 860.5600000000001
no they are yeah brian brent's logic is

861.12 --> 864.8
a real big math nerd

863.519 --> 866.8
yeah

864.8 --> 870.56
and then of course we got adam meekin

866.8 --> 872.7199999999999
who is like a genuine math nerd like

870.56 --> 874.6389999999999
he's even a bit ashamed about it he's

872.72 --> 876.0
that much of a math nerd he's really

874.639 --> 878.399
good at it

876.0 --> 879.12
like so much better than i am he has

878.399 --> 881.76
like

879.12 --> 885.12
teacher level clarity

881.76 --> 887.519
that i i don't have the patience to get

885.12 --> 890.24
there ever

887.519 --> 891.839
right there's definitely math nerds in

890.24 --> 892.9590000000001
the fed

891.839 --> 893.839
okay

892.959 --> 897.4399999999999
and

893.839 --> 899.839
tenth man is also surprisingly good at

897.44 --> 899.839
math

900.399 --> 904.639
a lot of guys in there are really good

902.16 --> 904.639
at math

905.12 --> 911.0
and that shows that that literally shows

907.519 --> 911.0
during the show

913.519 --> 916.24
hey crockett

918.8 --> 921.8
right

927.44 --> 933.12
so it's literature because it was

930.399 --> 933.12
better at all

934.639 --> 942.5600000000001
that's funny because i did have math in

938.839 --> 943.6800000000001
school i because i thought i needed it

942.56 --> 945.8389999999999
like i

943.68 --> 949.4399999999999
at the time was more afraid i was gonna

945.839 --> 951.0400000000001
lose track and lose oversight so i i did

949.44 --> 954.399
take math

951.04 --> 956.56
math b which is like very

954.399 --> 958.639
not about statistics and all that but

956.56 --> 961.8389999999999
really about the mechanics of math

958.639 --> 963.519
itself patterns basically

961.839 --> 966.0790000000001
but yeah a lot of the time i wouldn't

963.519 --> 968.32
even show up in class

966.079 --> 970.6389999999999
i didn't necessarily need to in the last

968.32 --> 974.0
years

970.639 --> 976.16
but then when i did show up

974.0 --> 977.839
i would be like oh my god this is so

976.16 --> 980.88
math

977.839 --> 983.759
and then i first think i do

980.88 --> 986.0
start looking around the other students

983.759 --> 988.24
like not oh what's this path no i would

986.0 --> 989.92
look around the other students like okay

988.24 --> 992.0
what

989.92 --> 994.56
are they learnings are they getting what

992.0 --> 996.639
they want or are they just waiting for

994.56 --> 998.8
that moment where they finally fight

996.639 --> 1002.0790000000001
find the enlightenment

998.8 --> 1003.4399999999999
and then i will kind of jump in

1002.079 --> 1005.5999999999999
basically

1003.44 --> 1007.36
address the teacher which most of them

1005.6 --> 1009.36
wouldn't even do

1007.36 --> 1012.16
we just keep silent i would address the

1009.36 --> 1013.44
math teacher and basically explain like

1012.16 --> 1015.4399999999999
wait

1013.44 --> 1017.759
maybe this little thing

1015.44 --> 1019.759
you shouldn't get that involved because

1017.759 --> 1021.759
it just makes things more confusing for

1019.759 --> 1023.279
everybody it's not it doesn't seem to be

1021.759 --> 1025.919
necessarily what you're trying to

1023.279 --> 1027.6
explain like those types of details the

1025.919 --> 1029.8390000000002
rest of the students wouldn't point that

1027.6 --> 1031.839
out but when i pointed it out and the

1029.839 --> 1035.4389999999999
teacher would recognize like

1031.839 --> 1037.1989999999998
you have a point okay forget this kids

1035.439 --> 1041.039
and then they'd all be like oh wait what

1037.199 --> 1041.039
oh oh fine thank god

1041.12 --> 1044.319
they would all wake up and start making

1042.799 --> 1046.48
notes

1044.319 --> 1048.6399999999999
and that was great

1046.48 --> 1052.0
and i eventually i made

1048.64 --> 1054.64
i made the exam on my intuition really

1052.0 --> 1056.08
on like pattern recognition with numbers

1054.64 --> 1058.24
like i would

1056.08 --> 1059.12
it was a lot of like multiple choice in

1058.24 --> 1062.52
there

1059.12 --> 1065.6789999999999
and i would just recognize the new

1062.52 --> 1069.36
numerological patterns

1065.679 --> 1071.52
for example i was always very good at

1069.36 --> 1073.52
like dividing up and then recognizing

1071.52 --> 1075.8799999999999
the numbers

1073.52 --> 1079.36
to know that

1075.88 --> 1081.0390000000002
0.333 etc is a third

1079.36 --> 1083.12
that

1081.039 --> 1085.12
right i can't even name them by heart

1083.12 --> 1088.32
but if i see the numbers i immediately

1085.12 --> 1089.4399999999998
know that that's like an eighth

1088.32 --> 1092.799
right

1089.44 --> 1096.559
and i would rest on that type of

1092.799 --> 1099.039
oversight to feel the numbers

1096.559 --> 1102.3999999999999
and that would work great it would work

1099.039 --> 1104.64
it would work really well

1102.4 --> 1105.919
in basically yeah looking through the

1104.64 --> 1106.8400000000001
multiple

1105.919 --> 1109.3600000000001
choice

1106.84 --> 1111.1999999999998
results available

1109.36 --> 1114.1599999999999
see the question and then figure out

1111.2 --> 1116.24
like yeah those could never fit

1114.16 --> 1117.76
it's either that or that

1116.24 --> 1120.64
and then like

1117.76 --> 1122.559
oh sometimes gamble for it but i did

1120.64 --> 1124.5590000000002
make the exam i did

1122.559 --> 1126.72
get it

1124.559 --> 1128.72
i did get through it successfully on

1126.72 --> 1131.039
intuition

1128.72 --> 1131.039
all right

1132.559 --> 1136.9189999999999
an intuition and pattern recognition

1142.72 --> 1149.72
did i ever take calculus

1146.72 --> 1149.72
what

1150.559 --> 1153.52
i think so yeah

1157.76 --> 1162.16
the the the problem was at a young age

1160.4 --> 1165.44
with math

1162.16 --> 1169.44
is that it like when i

1165.44 --> 1172.72
decided i wanted be good at math

1169.44 --> 1174.96
it started distracting my spirit a lot

1172.72 --> 1178.08
sounds weird right

1174.96 --> 1180.559
but i would get so enthusiastic

1178.08 --> 1182.72
because of the patterns oh a channel no

1180.559 --> 1182.72
no

1183.039 --> 1185.52
wait what

1185.679 --> 1191.3600000000001
oh sorry no never mind but

1188.799 --> 1193.2
i would get so distracted by

1191.36 --> 1195.76
figuring out these patterns that i

1193.2 --> 1198.72
became kind of obsessed with math

1195.76 --> 1201.52
and it initiated like this attitude math

1198.72 --> 1204.4
is reality so i was a kid that was

1201.52 --> 1207.4
actually a math is reality for quite a

1204.4 --> 1207.4
while

1208.4 --> 1214.48
like up until my 16th or something

1213.12 --> 1216.8799999999999
because

1214.48 --> 1219.2
i was really good at math and because it

1216.88 --> 1221.5200000000002
made me kind of believe

1219.2 --> 1223.2
that math is reality because it works

1221.52 --> 1225.52
out so well

1223.2 --> 1227.919
but then

1225.52 --> 1230.08
when that was kind of broken it shocked

1227.919 --> 1230.0800000000002
me

1230.88 --> 1235.679
which by the way was mostly due to my

1233.36 --> 1237.76
brother my older brother a half brother

1235.679 --> 1239.6000000000001
that was really good at math and was

1237.76 --> 1242.96
getting it at a university and then

1239.6 --> 1244.0
explained some things about einstein

1242.96 --> 1247.52
to me

1244.0 --> 1249.44
right and me with my already newtonian

1247.52 --> 1251.84
mindset

1249.44 --> 1254.4
i was really shocked about that all

1251.84 --> 1256.559
and that made me actually just abandon

1254.4 --> 1258.3200000000002
math

1256.559 --> 1260.72
and just say okay i the pattern

1258.32 --> 1262.72
recognition is important but math isn't

1260.72 --> 1265.84
reality and i've been fooled in many

1262.72 --> 1269.1200000000001
ways because i thought it was

1265.84 --> 1271.4399999999998
and since then i have not really

1269.12 --> 1272.6399999999999
loved math again

1271.44 --> 1275.679
like that

1272.64 --> 1278.7990000000002
like i did in my youth

1275.679 --> 1281.1200000000001
i just try to respect it

1278.799 --> 1281.12
anyway

1288.96 --> 1295.1200000000001
hear me say math in plural it's maths

1292.0 --> 1296.88
well i'm not talking about

1295.12 --> 1299.6
mathematical

1296.88 --> 1301.2800000000002
things like a mathematical sentence or a

1299.6 --> 1303.36
proposition that could be considered

1301.28 --> 1305.28
maths i'm talking about

1303.36 --> 1307.36
math

1305.28 --> 1308.6399999999999
in general

1307.36 --> 1310.799
i don't know

1308.64 --> 1312.3200000000002
should be able to just say math

1310.799 --> 1315.36
right when you're addressing the

1312.32 --> 1315.36
universal stuff

1316.32 --> 1322.24
not a particular

1319.679 --> 1323.2800000000002
set of calculations

1322.24 --> 1327.1200000000001
i don't know

1323.28 --> 1328.48
yeah maybe i misunderstand that

1327.12 --> 1333.1589999999999
the maths

1328.48 --> 1333.159
seems to be very british thing to say

1335.36 --> 1340.24
floors hate math no they don't

1338.4 --> 1342.5590000000002
not all of them

1340.24 --> 1343.52
there's some really good math

1342.559 --> 1346.0
people

1343.52 --> 1347.6
among flat earth i i mentioned them like

1346.0 --> 1350.48
in the flat earth debates there are some

1347.6 --> 1350.48
real good ones

1352.4 --> 1354.64
all right

1358.32 --> 1363.84
yeah that's right steamy traveler it's a

1361.36 --> 1366.08
very british thing a thing i think to

1363.84 --> 1369.08
call it maths

1366.08 --> 1369.08
maths

1379.039 --> 1382.559
right

1380.24 --> 1385.1200000000001
and it's funny too you know i really

1382.559 --> 1386.8799999999999
appreciate all the cultural

1385.12 --> 1388.8799999999999
differences and

1386.88 --> 1391.1200000000001
how to deal with that there's so much to

1388.88 --> 1391.1200000000001
learn

1392.0 --> 1399.08
just in language all the differences

1395.28 --> 1399.08
in the english language

1403.36 --> 1406.36
hmm

1417.919 --> 1422.0
oh yeah

1419.919 --> 1424.24
by the way yeah thank you for moderating

1422.0 --> 1424.24
there

1424.559 --> 1427.6789999999999
but yeah if you see the

1428.84 --> 1435.4399999999998
bots those bots just

1432.4 --> 1438.4
just completely remove them

1435.44 --> 1442.88
only if it's those bots right or some

1438.4 --> 1442.88
something spamming blatantly

1443.36 --> 1449.3999999999999
like quick spam to fill it

1446.4 --> 1449.4
right

1466.799 --> 1472.36
coffee seems to be working out decently

1468.96 --> 1472.3600000000001
but i'm feeling

1472.799 --> 1477.84
i am feeling it

1475.84 --> 1481.24
maybe i should just take like really

1477.84 --> 1481.24
tiny coffees

1491.44 --> 1496.159
must all be american tv

1493.84 --> 1496.1589999999999
yeah

1498.32 --> 1501.84
for me it was like transformers g1

1500.799 --> 1503.52
series

1501.84 --> 1506.24
as a little kid

1503.52 --> 1506.24
it's just that

1507.76 --> 1512.84
there's certain type of ways

1510.0 --> 1514.48
to speak in america and if you're like

1512.84 --> 1516.1589999999999
really

1514.48 --> 1519.279
morally high

1516.159 --> 1521.919
but actually and not in a dumb way

1519.279 --> 1524.24
or in a bullish way

1521.919 --> 1527.76
it's magical to me

1524.24 --> 1529.36
like tr truly morally

1527.76 --> 1530.4
spirited

1529.36 --> 1532.3999999999999
with some

1530.4 --> 1533.6000000000001
like

1532.4 --> 1536.72
reserve

1533.6 --> 1538.08
carefulness in it and just the wisdom i

1536.72 --> 1539.2
don't know there's something about

1538.08 --> 1541.36
america

1539.2 --> 1543.6000000000001
and with british

1541.36 --> 1545.279
high british it's different

1543.6 --> 1547.52
it's

1545.279 --> 1550.159
also good at that but for some reason

1547.52 --> 1551.76
with the british when they do that

1550.159 --> 1554.64
they have like

1551.76 --> 1557.84
so much more modesty and all that

1554.64 --> 1557.8400000000001
it works differently

1561.039 --> 1567.76
it it focuses on other things

1564.08 --> 1568.84
energy-wise it's it's so strange

1567.76 --> 1572.32
but like

1568.84 --> 1576.559
the real convinced

1572.32 --> 1578.96
morally upright and reserved and careful

1576.559 --> 1580.24
american

1578.96 --> 1582.8400000000001
language

1580.24 --> 1586.159
like spoken with great care is just

1582.84 --> 1588.48
amazing but if it's manipulative in some

1586.159 --> 1591.679
way or dumbed down or bullish then it

1588.48 --> 1593.84
can get really annoying right

1591.679 --> 1596.88
but the brits

1593.84 --> 1599.279
is a whole nother deal

1596.88 --> 1601.8400000000001
this is the like that the spirit of of

1599.279 --> 1605.039
your british is different

1601.84 --> 1605.039
on the different layers

1610.72 --> 1615.1200000000001
can i speak with a british accent

1615.36 --> 1618.799
well

1616.159 --> 1621.7990000000002
i can basically sort of enact british

1618.799 --> 1621.799
character

1627.84 --> 1630.1589999999999
yeah

1629.2 --> 1632.799
but

1630.159 --> 1636.0800000000002
not for consistent

1632.799 --> 1638.32
times like i can't switch to that as a

1636.08 --> 1642.8799999999999
foundation for myself

1638.32 --> 1642.8799999999999
like this is just the way i talk

1643.6 --> 1650.0
in english it is basically

1646.88 --> 1654.7600000000002
american but with

1650.0 --> 1654.76
a little a couple of british traits

1664.64 --> 1670.88
yeah if i play out a character

1668.64 --> 1673.679
then i can speak british it's very

1670.88 --> 1675.679
magical but i can't like

1673.679 --> 1679.279
keep doing that

1675.679 --> 1679.279
can't stay in character like

1681.52 --> 1685.36
it's hard to describe even why

1685.919 --> 1690.88
it's just so that

1688.0 --> 1692.88
the potential for precision in like the

1690.88 --> 1695.3600000000001
british way of speaking

1692.88 --> 1698.0800000000002
is so deep

1695.36 --> 1699.12
it's like i can't handle that range as

1698.08 --> 1702.12
in

1699.12 --> 1702.12
improvising

1702.96 --> 1706.72
like improvising my way through doing

1705.12 --> 1709.12
that with the american

1706.72 --> 1711.6000000000001
works absolutely perfect for me it

1709.12 --> 1714.8799999999999
really does

1711.6 --> 1717.6789999999999
but english is like too complicated to

1714.88 --> 1717.679
do that for me

1723.44 --> 1728.88
like i get

1725.12 --> 1731.1999999999998
the american sayings the typical sayings

1728.88 --> 1734.7990000000002
i understand a lot of them i know a lot

1731.2 --> 1737.8400000000001
of them with british there is so much

1734.799 --> 1740.08
there's so much i can't

1737.84 --> 1742.24
it's too much

1740.08 --> 1745.279
and there's like a detailed

1742.24 --> 1747.279
saying for like all kinds of situations

1745.279 --> 1749.279
and all the ritz they all know about it

1747.279 --> 1753.12
that's even creepier to me it's like

1749.279 --> 1755.279
dude how do you know all that

1753.12 --> 1758.1589999999999
like a library

1755.279 --> 1760.32
of like really historically detailed

1758.159 --> 1762.3990000000001
sayings and [ __ ] and so many british

1760.32 --> 1764.799
people know them it's just mind-boggling

1762.399 --> 1766.799
sometimes

1764.799 --> 1768.96
and if you're not used to it you really

1766.799 --> 1771.2
have to like try to puzzle out what they

1768.96 --> 1773.679
even mean

1771.2 --> 1777.24
the americans don't and their sayings

1773.679 --> 1777.24
are much more straightforward

1782.0 --> 1788.399
this is also based on practical things

1786.159 --> 1788.3990000000001
right

1792.32 --> 1796.8799999999999
sounds more like crocodile dundee then

1795.279 --> 1799.44
yeah but that's

1796.88 --> 1802.0800000000002
australian

1799.44 --> 1805.52
australian

1802.08 --> 1805.52
is completely different

1806.159 --> 1811.3600000000001
that's not british

1809.279 --> 1813.039
the inflections

1811.36 --> 1814.799
in where

1813.039 --> 1817.36
you decide

1814.799 --> 1820.76
the tones go

1817.36 --> 1820.76
quite different

1822.32 --> 1827.2
and i don't know anything about

1824.159 --> 1827.2
australian sayings

1830.24 --> 1834.3990000000001
sometimes i think they just make them up

1832.08 --> 1836.559
on the spot

1834.399 --> 1838.0
and that and that immediately everybody

1836.559 --> 1842.08
just gets it or something i don't know

1838.0 --> 1842.08
it's weird with australians this is

1846.64 --> 1851.8400000000001
uh

1848.559 --> 1851.84
rc in yeah yeah

1858.88 --> 1861.88
crikey

1870.08 --> 1874.96
a fad income yeah yeah

1872.64 --> 1877.039
like that doesn't mean anything but

1874.96 --> 1880.96
everybody in australia knows what it

1877.039 --> 1880.96
means apparently

1888.799 --> 1893.84
you a great gala i don't even know what

1890.72 --> 1893.84
that means

1894.159 --> 1898.24
i know

1895.279 --> 1900.0
it's typical to call women sheilas

1898.24 --> 1902.64
apparently although that might be more

1900.0 --> 1904.88
of a modern slang

1902.64 --> 1907.1200000000001
australian instead of classical

1904.88 --> 1911.1200000000001
australian

1907.12 --> 1911.12
classical australians kind of yeah

1918.559 --> 1923.44
he does australian for a british act

1920.72 --> 1926.48
that's just embarrassing

1923.44 --> 1929.44
it's just embarrassing

1926.48 --> 1931.6
but i don't even know why you guys

1929.44 --> 1935.8400000000001
know about all that

1931.6 --> 1935.84
i mean is he really that interesting

1936.559 --> 1941.279
or is it just that

1938.64 --> 1941.279
i don't know

1941.6 --> 1947.12
a burning trash can

1944.799 --> 1949.039
is better than nothing i don't know

1947.12 --> 1952.0
like i don't know anything i don't watch

1949.039 --> 1952.0
his dreams at all

1953.039 --> 1957.679
every time i get reminded about what he

1955.279 --> 1959.84
does it's always again like oh i'm so

1957.679 --> 1962.159
glad that i don't freaking watch your

1959.84 --> 1963.1999999999998
shows

1962.159 --> 1966.2
ugh

1963.2 --> 1966.2
terrible

1988.799 --> 1991.799
hmm

1997.76 --> 2001.08
oh dear

2002.2 --> 2005.339
[Applause]

2008.399 --> 2013.1999999999998
seems like a

2010.88 --> 2015.519
refracted curve john

2013.2 --> 2017.3600000000001
who's part of the flat earth debate

2015.519 --> 2020.96
it may have cove

2017.36 --> 2020.9599999999998
in his family too so

2023.519 --> 2028.24
means he has a call

2025.919 --> 2028.24
all right

2029.76 --> 2033.84
that's what you're hearing with all the

2031.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
pop-ups

2037.12 --> 2040.12
right

2056.639 --> 2063.44
flat out hero never heard of that says

2060.32 --> 2063.44
he's a glober i

2064.159 --> 2068.7200000000003
no that doesn't work though

2066.48 --> 2071.2
i mean you can become an anti-flat

2068.72 --> 2071.2
earther

2071.76 --> 2075.2000000000003
but

2073.04 --> 2077.7599999999998
yeah nathan talks about this on the flat

2075.2 --> 2080.0789999999997
earth debates a lot and that is like

2077.76 --> 2082.159
once you roll down that hill

2080.079 --> 2084.96
of consciousness and you figure out it

2082.159 --> 2089.32
isn't a globe and you accept it flat

2084.96 --> 2089.32
you can't roll back up the hill

2090.8 --> 2094.639
like you can either stay

2093.52 --> 2097.04
down

2094.639 --> 2099.2000000000003
the flat level plane

2097.04 --> 2100.8
or you become an anti-flat earther and

2099.2 --> 2103.7999999999997
you start

2100.8 --> 2103.8
basically

2104.0 --> 2107.68
defying your own senses

2113.04 --> 2117.8
but yeah i don't know who that is steven

2114.8 --> 2117.8
traveler

2142.64 --> 2145.64
huh

2162.8 --> 2166.2400000000002
hello canada bear

2168.72 --> 2172.48
dave

2169.76 --> 2173.6800000000003
did it three and a half oh jesus that's

2172.48 --> 2176.96
long

2173.68 --> 2176.96
and they flat earthers

2179.68 --> 2186.0
okay could be

2182.079 --> 2188.32
i haven't watched it like

2186.0 --> 2190.48
i don't really watch

2188.32 --> 2191.76
any of the anti-flat earthers they're

2190.48 --> 2194.56
material

2191.76 --> 2196.88
i mean sometimes i get like mentions and

2194.56 --> 2199.119
then i see it like oh somebody mentioned

2196.88 --> 2201.6800000000003
you again oh sean hawkins or something

2199.119 --> 2204.48
usually him

2201.68 --> 2206.8799999999997
but it's always lame like it's never

2204.48 --> 2209.119
actually an in-content response to

2206.88 --> 2210.48
anything i ever say

2209.119 --> 2213.48
ever

2210.48 --> 2213.48
ever

2216.0 --> 2219.04
and then even

2217.44 --> 2220.56
when they try to ridicule something

2219.04 --> 2222.8
about me

2220.56 --> 2222.7999999999997
like

2224.079 --> 2227.48
was it again

2229.359 --> 2231.92
like this

2233.52 --> 2237.839
irwin is an old kick-ass wizard from

2235.68 --> 2240.0789999999997
just some random guy and i say like yeah

2237.839 --> 2241.599
i've had dark well experience lasted 80

2240.079 --> 2243.8390000000004
years that's right

2241.599 --> 2246.6400000000003
and he's like oh he's insane and i'm

2243.839 --> 2250.56
like no no that's actually real i stand

2246.64 --> 2253.839
by that i just in the comments like no

2250.56 --> 2253.839
i've said it many times

2253.92 --> 2259.6800000000003
like you can ask me about it i'll be

2256.4 --> 2261.599
descriptive about it etc etc

2259.68 --> 2264.48
and just comments are like oh it's all

2261.599 --> 2265.3590000000004
gone insane and

2264.48 --> 2268.32
so

2265.359 --> 2269.5989999999997
i don't really get like challenges

2268.32 --> 2273.28
it's just

2269.599 --> 2275.2000000000003
sometimes people like to make fun of me

2273.28 --> 2277.28
especially i don't know that i have

2275.2 --> 2279.839
silent pauses

2277.28 --> 2281.44
somebody made like like a video where i

2279.839 --> 2285.04
kind of like make

2281.44 --> 2287.119
sniffies or coughing or me stretching

2285.04 --> 2290.4
they make silly videos about me but i

2287.119 --> 2290.4
don't really even get

2290.72 --> 2293.839
inquiry based

2292.48 --> 2297.04
videos

2293.839 --> 2300.7999999999997
and get them nobody does that it's like

2297.04 --> 2300.8
either nobody understands

2301.2 --> 2305.1189999999997
or they just don't know what to do with

2302.96 --> 2305.119
it

2306.32 --> 2310.6400000000003
and i'm very surprised about that by the

2308.56 --> 2312.48
way like i would have expected there

2310.64 --> 2314.96
would be more people that would actually

2312.48 --> 2317.92
just challenge me on things other than

2314.96 --> 2320.32
yeah do the polaris challenge

2317.92 --> 2322.32
that kind of nonsense no i'm not i'm not

2320.32 --> 2324.0
going to do the stupid math and even if

2322.32 --> 2325.76
i did it

2324.0 --> 2328.32
immediately prove you're wrong like you

2325.76 --> 2328.32
don't care

2331.52 --> 2333.7599999999998
right

2337.52 --> 2341.7599999999998
but like even getting people to

2340.0 --> 2346.079
basically

2341.76 --> 2347.599
ask questions about the looping is

2346.079 --> 2350.6400000000003
ultra rare

2347.599 --> 2350.6400000000003
it's ultra rare

2352.32 --> 2359.52
like even that time uh when i had my

2356.0 --> 2362.0
night owl show where rob durham came on

2359.52 --> 2364.72
it kinda like

2362.0 --> 2367.52
almost became a subject like yeah the

2364.72 --> 2370.3999999999996
rectangular map might be looping

2367.52 --> 2372.88
and rob durham is like

2370.4 --> 2374.56
not being like oh that's ridiculous or

2372.88 --> 2376.32
but he was like

2374.56 --> 2379.04
scared

2376.32 --> 2381.6800000000003
he was kind of scared to go there he was

2379.04 --> 2384.48
very nervous about that

2381.68 --> 2384.48
that's weird

2384.8 --> 2390.32
like why

2386.48 --> 2393.04
what is so unnerving about a looping

2390.32 --> 2396.1600000000003
realm what is so unbelievably unnerving

2393.04 --> 2397.92
like oh it you have to be like under

2396.16 --> 2401.359
some kind of a physical theme it has to

2397.92 --> 2401.359
all be euclidean does it

2401.599 --> 2406.96
why why why do you have to feel like

2404.64 --> 2409.68
you're under a

2406.96 --> 2412.319
like on a serving dish you know with the

2409.68 --> 2414.24
metal cup over it why do you have to be

2412.319 --> 2416.24
inside that

2414.24 --> 2419.5989999999997
why does it all have to be euclidean to

2416.24 --> 2420.8799999999997
you i mean you're never going to touch

2419.599 --> 2422.7200000000003
any of that

2420.88 --> 2424.8
anyway

2422.72 --> 2426.319
so what does it matter why does it have

2424.8 --> 2429.6800000000003
to be

2426.319 --> 2431.68
in your mind emulatable

2429.68 --> 2436.04
like a physical object right in front of

2431.68 --> 2436.04
you why do you have to have that

2438.079 --> 2442.2400000000002
why can't it be more like a computer

2440.24 --> 2444.3999999999996
simulation and just

2442.24 --> 2446.16
like this is the box this side of the

2444.4 --> 2448.64
box connects to that side of the box

2446.16 --> 2451.1189999999997
that side of the box connects to that

2448.64 --> 2453.2
and you can center view on one figure

2451.119 --> 2454.56
moving around and then just the entire

2453.2 --> 2457.1189999999997
box

2454.56 --> 2458.24
moves underneath them right that sort of

2457.119 --> 2460.56
looping

2458.24 --> 2462.7999999999997
it's not that hard to imagine

2460.56 --> 2464.72
why is it so

2462.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
scary or

2464.72 --> 2467.839
ridicule worthy

2468.96 --> 2471.92
i don't understand

2475.839 --> 2481.7999999999997
they had an earpiece

2477.839 --> 2481.7999999999997
oh i didn't even know that

2483.04 --> 2488.319
the pilots they've interviewed had

2485.599 --> 2491.6400000000003
earpieces and that is

2488.319 --> 2491.64
that's special

2507.52 --> 2512.319
forget okay kinda bear wait who are you

2509.76 --> 2512.3190000000004
talking about

2512.88 --> 2516.119
the dude

2522.48 --> 2524.72
hey

2524.8 --> 2529.28
a retro bill thanks for the ten dollar

2527.2 --> 2532.0
super chat donation

2529.28 --> 2535.4100000000003
hi irwin how does the iss claim to

2532.0 --> 2538.0
retain its orientation in space

2535.41 --> 2540.16
[Laughter]

2538.0 --> 2541.92
wouldn't a thrust in any direction cause

2540.16 --> 2544.48
permanent spin

2541.92 --> 2548.16
in the opposite direction without

2544.48 --> 2550.96
air to slow and stabilize yes

2548.16 --> 2553.5989999999997
that's a very thank you for the 10 super

2550.96 --> 2555.28
chat donation and a great question right

2553.599 --> 2557.2000000000003
we're going to

2555.28 --> 2560.2400000000002
go to

2557.2 --> 2562.24
space mechanics heliocentric mechanics

2560.24 --> 2563.839
how is it supposed to work with that

2562.24 --> 2566.16
question it's great

2563.839 --> 2566.16
yes

2567.76 --> 2572.4
there's multiple issues with that

2569.92 --> 2574.4
right because on one hand they're super

2572.4 --> 2576.319
low pressure

2574.4 --> 2578.64
but they're still sort of within reach

2576.319 --> 2580.72
of the atmosphere

2578.64 --> 2582.72
and so there's going to be very little

2580.72 --> 2583.839
friction

2582.72 --> 2585.4399999999996
but still

2583.839 --> 2587.68
some

2585.44 --> 2590.48
that it's gonna

2587.68 --> 2592.56
force to basically have constant course

2590.48 --> 2594.319
corrections because the friction will on

2592.56 --> 2596.7999999999997
average make it

2594.319 --> 2596.8
rigid

2599.52 --> 2604.48
right if there's no friction you can

2601.44 --> 2607.28
literally just get one single pulse and

2604.48 --> 2608.88
the entire thing will from then on

2607.28 --> 2611.599
rotate like that so if there was a

2608.88 --> 2613.04
perfect vacuum around the iss it was

2611.599 --> 2614.88
further away

2613.04 --> 2617.2
then it would just have to give one

2614.88 --> 2619.44
pulse at the right amount

2617.2 --> 2621.4399999999996
and it would just

2619.44 --> 2623.44
in the cycle of time it's supposed to

2621.44 --> 2624.4
curve around the earth

2623.44 --> 2628.079
just

2624.4 --> 2630.4
rotate exactly enough

2628.079 --> 2632.0
exactly enough

2630.4 --> 2633.76
because there's no friction to slow that

2632.0 --> 2635.44
down now because there is friction they

2633.76 --> 2637.2000000000003
would have to

2635.44 --> 2638.88
every now and then

2637.2 --> 2640.72
do another pulse

2638.88 --> 2644.0
because it's going to slow down slightly

2640.72 --> 2644.0
because of the air friction

2644.56 --> 2647.68
but yes

2646.0 --> 2651.28
it's not just

2647.68 --> 2651.2799999999997
without pulses gonna

2651.76 --> 2656.079
orient itself based on the

2656.319 --> 2660.24
on the center point of sphere earth

2658.56 --> 2663.64
right that doesn't automatically it's

2660.24 --> 2663.64
not gonna autocorrect

2664.64 --> 2669.92
so yeah

2666.4 --> 2672.8
if there's no auto correction whatsoever

2669.92 --> 2676.28
about its orientation then technically

2672.8 --> 2676.28
it should be

2678.319 --> 2682.56
let's see what are we going to use as

2679.839 --> 2682.56
the iss

2687.2 --> 2692.0
i'm going to use

2688.839 --> 2692.0
yeah why not

2692.48 --> 2697.599
all right so you got the ball earth

2695.359 --> 2700.48
and you got the iss

2697.599 --> 2705.4
and the iss is this orientation well if

2700.48 --> 2705.4
it's has no auto correction whatsoever

2706.8 --> 2712.1600000000003
it should be

2709.119 --> 2714.0
spinning and keeping its exact euclidean

2712.16 --> 2717.72
orientation

2714.0 --> 2717.72
unless it gets

2719.04 --> 2720.96
and then

2720.16 --> 2723.5989999999997
it

2720.96 --> 2726.88
has to artificially basically

2723.599 --> 2729.04
keep correcting its orientation

2726.88 --> 2733.48
to have the same orientation in relation

2729.04 --> 2733.48
to earth that it's moving around

2735.28 --> 2740.88
because if it wouldn't you would have

2737.04 --> 2745.64
the same effect as like a gyroscope

2740.88 --> 2745.6400000000003
it would stay in its rigid orientation

2748.56 --> 2751.72
all right

2755.91 --> 2759.04
[Music]

2763.2 --> 2767.4399999999996
what are you talking about martian

2765.52 --> 2770.7599999999998
michael sarson

2767.44 --> 2770.76
oh okay

2775.52 --> 2780.24
i'm just through dave and jaren's point

2780.319 --> 2785.359
oh david weiss i thought you meant like

2783.28 --> 2787.92
professor dave or something i literally

2785.359 --> 2790.4
don't know what you were talking about

2787.92 --> 2793.2000000000003
oh right so dave and jaron went up

2790.4 --> 2795.04
against ballers well anti-fled earth

2793.2 --> 2797.7599999999998
yeah well that makes sense then so they

2795.04 --> 2799.52
got in a bunch of anti-flat earth pilots

2797.76 --> 2802.5200000000004
pilots right did they even show their

2799.52 --> 2802.52
credentials

2803.359 --> 2808.64
thanks that almost seems possible if

2806.079 --> 2810.7200000000003
space arrow exactly retro bill you get

2808.64 --> 2810.72
it

2812.72 --> 2816.9599999999996
it's all space mechanic it's virtual

2814.8 --> 2819.76
right first the idea based on the

2816.96 --> 2821.76
parameters

2819.76 --> 2822.8
that are kind of like

2821.76 --> 2824.88
set

2822.8 --> 2826.88
because everybody decides it's set

2824.88 --> 2829.04
that's a cons this is a consensus based

2826.88 --> 2831.359
dream right but

2829.04 --> 2834.079
it's kind of strict because if you get

2831.359 --> 2836.96
too liberal it just becomes a giant

2834.079 --> 2838.96
hallucinatory mess

2836.96 --> 2840.64
and then nobody understands it you're

2838.96 --> 2842.64
supposed to understand you're supposed

2840.64 --> 2844.72
to be able to simulate it in your mind

2842.64 --> 2845.68
like what should be that's kind of the

2844.72 --> 2848.24
point

2845.68 --> 2851.5989999999997
of the entire model that's what

2848.24 --> 2851.5989999999997
makes it a culture

2851.76 --> 2855.6800000000003
to do that to be able to do that and

2853.599 --> 2857.52
have an oversight and understand how

2855.68 --> 2860.319
things should be working according to

2857.52 --> 2860.319
the mechanics

2862.96 --> 2868.079
how is gravity when no gravity is

2866.0 --> 2869.68
on the iss schedule

2868.079 --> 2873.2000000000003
well there is supposed to be

2869.68 --> 2876.64
microgravity there but it's so small

2873.2 --> 2879.4399999999996
that it's not enough to

2876.64 --> 2879.44
to be pushed

2882.48 --> 2885.52
from what i remember

2885.68 --> 2889.2799999999997
you still have kind of

2887.359 --> 2893.68
free floating effect

2889.28 --> 2896.079
and it is still just orbiting so it is

2893.68 --> 2898.64
as described falling around in a

2896.079 --> 2901.119
circular path

2898.64 --> 2902.0789999999997
how that ever managed to fit its way

2901.119 --> 2904.319
through

2902.079 --> 2907.6400000000003
into the mind

2904.319 --> 2907.64
is a mystery

2914.48 --> 2919.76
all far beyond simple fluff brains ah

2925.04 --> 2927.52
yeah

2925.839 --> 2929.92
so simple

2927.52 --> 2932.8
that yeah

2929.92 --> 2935.119
we actually just reverse engineer what

2932.8 --> 2938.6400000000003
the entire baller religion is and can

2935.119 --> 2938.6400000000003
emulate it at our best

2938.72 --> 2943.2
yeah

2940.48 --> 2946.2
so far beyond simple flat earth lanes

2943.2 --> 2946.2
yeah

2963.599 --> 2967.92
the iss is a giant gyro

2969.2 --> 2974.5589999999997
well does it

2970.64 --> 2974.5589999999997
have like gyroscopes on board

2978.16 --> 2983.92
because gyroscopes make

2981.28 --> 2987.44
standard correction they also have an

2983.92 --> 2989.119
influence because gyroscopes really

2987.44 --> 2992.0
with force

2989.119 --> 2994.48
try to keep whatever they are in

2992.0 --> 2994.48
stable

2997.28 --> 3003.0400000000004
like gyroscopes are really

2999.44 --> 3006.839
have mysterious influences on motion

3003.04 --> 3006.839
it really does

3016.48 --> 3020.88
but yeah canada i don't think that the

3018.319 --> 3025.64
iss is supposed to represent the giant

3020.88 --> 3025.6400000000003
gyroscope i don't think so at all

3036.88 --> 3042.8
yeah anyway

3039.47 --> 3042.7999999999997
[Music]

3053.92 --> 3060.559
yo what's happening with my chat

3056.48 --> 3060.559
it's at least three minutes silence

3062.96 --> 3068.88
iss is it balanced

3065.2 --> 3072.839
by fidget spinners

3068.88 --> 3072.839
all right kendall bear

3090.079 --> 3094.48
60 mile

3091.92 --> 3095.599
per degree change uh

3094.48 --> 3097.119
yeah

3095.599 --> 3099.04
well that's part of the globe of the

3097.119 --> 3102.1600000000003
heavens right

3099.04 --> 3102.16
the apparent

3103.2 --> 3107.4399999999996
demi globe of stars and sun and

3105.119 --> 3109.44
everything that we see

3107.44 --> 3111.2000000000003
doesn't have any actual distance but

3109.44 --> 3113.52
yeah there is a direct angular

3111.2 --> 3116.319
correlation

3113.52 --> 3119.359
with the position of the earth in

3116.319 --> 3119.359
another position

3121.52 --> 3125.44
right

3122.48 --> 3127.92
so the stars are a globe but the earth

3125.44 --> 3130.16
is flat

3127.92 --> 3132.079
and it's not

3130.16 --> 3135.44
a flat disc

3132.079 --> 3137.04
in the midst of a imagined super galaxy

3135.44 --> 3139.359
with all the suns and stars and

3137.04 --> 3142.079
everything and planets far away as other

3139.359 --> 3145.68
entities no it's all holographic it's a

3142.079 --> 3148.319
light spectacle that surrounds observers

3145.68 --> 3148.319
at all time

3148.96 --> 3154.319
on a flat disc or while on a flat

3151.839 --> 3158.72
surface i don't know if it's a disc

3154.319 --> 3158.72
that's debatable heavily debatable

3160.319 --> 3164.8
celestial sphere yeah that's why i do

3163.119 --> 3168.319
call it like either the globe of the

3164.8 --> 3169.92
heavens or the celestial sphere

3168.319 --> 3172.0
although in reality it's always a

3169.92 --> 3173.76
demisphere because you never see the

3172.0 --> 3176.48
full thing

3173.76 --> 3179.28
in one observation that's impossible you

3176.48 --> 3179.28
never see that

3179.599 --> 3185.76
you only can see half of it at all time

3183.119 --> 3189.599
because the other half is underneath the

3185.76 --> 3194.6800000000003
flat earth and there is nothing there

3189.599 --> 3194.6800000000003
except more dirt and rock

3206.72 --> 3210.64
need to try draw out the angular

3208.72 --> 3213.52
relationship well it's not that hard if

3210.64 --> 3213.52
you just kind of take

3214.079 --> 3218.6400000000003
celestial globe as a sphere around you

3216.24 --> 3220.4799999999996
and it's like a a ball and just rotates

3218.64 --> 3222.16
you move that way and it rotates like

3220.48 --> 3223.92
that you move that way it rotates like

3222.16 --> 3225.1189999999997
that

3223.92 --> 3226.48
move north

3225.119 --> 3228.319
then

3226.48 --> 3230.8
it rotates like this and the northern

3228.319 --> 3233.7599999999998
star comes above you and goes south and

3230.8 --> 3236.8
it rotates like that it's yeah it's like

3233.76 --> 3238.88
a ball and it just moves

3236.8 --> 3242.48
as you move

3238.88 --> 3246.2400000000002
and it moves by itself rotating slowly

3242.48 --> 3250.599
over time as well in a consistent amount

3246.24 --> 3250.5989999999997
on its apparent axis

3253.359 --> 3258.24
i mean it shouldn't be overall very

3255.92 --> 3261.359
difficult to create

3258.24 --> 3265.3999999999996
like a visualized simulation of that

3261.359 --> 3265.4
from an outsider perspective

3265.92 --> 3270.48
like my

3268.4 --> 3272.64
thumbnail for my shows which i kind of

3270.48 --> 3275.04
use like all the time

3272.64 --> 3277.359
that's already that

3275.04 --> 3280.319
like that is a simulation from an

3277.359 --> 3283.7599999999998
outside perspective on kinda what's

3280.319 --> 3283.7599999999998
going on down there

3285.359 --> 3289.44
underside now there is no underside

3290.88 --> 3293.839
the orientation

3295.839 --> 3302.48
of the relative density this equilibrium

3298.88 --> 3304.839
force directions does not change

3302.48 --> 3307.839
there's no other

3304.839 --> 3308.96
side not literally

3307.839 --> 3311.44
i mean

3308.96 --> 3312.559
it's spiritually there may be another

3311.44 --> 3314.799
side

3312.559 --> 3317.28
and they might even

3314.799 --> 3318.96
have in the past tried to reify that in

3317.28 --> 3321.2000000000003
my mind

3318.96 --> 3323.68
just say no this is literally

3321.2 --> 3325.1189999999997
the under half of the world

3323.68 --> 3327.359
the dark world that's what they tried to

3325.119 --> 3330.6400000000003
convince me of and i believed that for a

3327.359 --> 3332.88
while until i figured out that

3330.64 --> 3334.64
a lot of the things they insert there in

3332.88 --> 3337.6800000000003
your head

3334.64 --> 3337.68
they don't even know

3344.799 --> 3349.7599999999998
so i just see it it's just

3347.359 --> 3352.16
on the other side but that's not

3349.76 --> 3353.28
physically on another side it's just

3352.16 --> 3354.8799999999997
through

3353.28 --> 3357.599
it's where the spirit can go and the

3354.88 --> 3357.599
body can't

3358.319 --> 3363.839
the dark world the dreamscape

3360.96 --> 3363.839
very similar

3368.319 --> 3375.4
like asking what was outside of and

3371.68 --> 3375.3999999999996
before big bang

3380.16 --> 3384.319
what's past the edge of space nothing

3386.319 --> 3391.7599999999998
that's yeah where space ends space ends

3390.16 --> 3395.92
in either loops

3391.76 --> 3395.92
then you can't reach beyond

3396.0 --> 3398.559
physically

3403.119 --> 3406.1600000000003
or

3404.559 --> 3408.079
yeah in another

3406.16 --> 3409.5989999999997
dimensional scale

3408.079 --> 3413.76
think creator

3409.599 --> 3417.119
yeah maybe you can like the outside look

3413.76 --> 3418.96
right looking outside of the realm

3417.119 --> 3421.04
and the globe of the heavens as it would

3418.96 --> 3424.7200000000003
surround an observer

3421.04 --> 3426.4
well maybe god the cr or designer

3424.72 --> 3428.64
functionaries

3426.4 --> 3430.559
in the highest spiritual order

3428.64 --> 3432.48
which would be god

3430.559 --> 3435.2000000000003
can go there

3432.48 --> 3438.96
it would simply be void to them

3435.2 --> 3440.48
although it would not be physical space

3438.96 --> 3444.0
it would be

3440.48 --> 3446.319
virtual spiritual space with void and

3444.0 --> 3448.079
who knows maybe there are like other

3446.319 --> 3450.16
realms

3448.079 --> 3453.119
or realm segments i've suggested this

3450.16 --> 3454.96
even kind of bordering

3453.119 --> 3456.88
looped space

3454.96 --> 3459.92
it's like you have

3456.88 --> 3461.359
a rectangle it loops from east to west

3459.92 --> 3466.079
well maybe

3461.359 --> 3467.44
virtually not literally virtually

3466.079 --> 3471.2000000000003
next

3467.44 --> 3473.839
yeah how do you even describe it next

3471.2 --> 3476.24
to the east and west loop

3473.839 --> 3477.68
beyond physical space because it loops

3476.24 --> 3480.5589999999997
in on itself

3477.68 --> 3483.2
from this to that from that to that

3480.559 --> 3487.0400000000004
next to it there might be a start of

3483.2 --> 3487.04
another realm segment loop

3487.119 --> 3492.7200000000003
that also loops east to west right next

3490.079 --> 3495.92
to it right physically you could not

3492.72 --> 3499.359
even explain that because it's two loops

3495.92 --> 3499.359
that kind of overlap

3500.079 --> 3506.799
but it might be made

3503.28 --> 3509.599
at some point through spatial dynamics

3506.799 --> 3511.839
leave it to god to do that if it's even

3509.599 --> 3514.1600000000003
possible

3511.839 --> 3515.359
to connect them and then suddenly where

3514.16 --> 3517.1189999999997
before

3515.359 --> 3519.92
you moved and you just ended up in the

3517.119 --> 3522.88
same space suddenly you don't

3519.92 --> 3526.319
loop back but instead you connect to an

3522.88 --> 3529.319
entirely different realm

3526.319 --> 3529.319
right

3532.4 --> 3535.76
what's that ah

3541.599 --> 3546.4
have you worked out what the physics of

3544.079 --> 3548.7200000000003
actual looping mechanism is and how it

3546.4 --> 3548.7200000000003
works

3549.119 --> 3553.839
no

3550.64 --> 3553.839
it's conceptual i

3554.0 --> 3558.4
how can you use

3556.0 --> 3559.76
physics

3558.4 --> 3560.88
to prove

3559.76 --> 3563.3590000000004
something

3560.88 --> 3566.559
spatial

3563.359 --> 3569.04
because it's not physical

3566.559 --> 3573.0400000000004
it's the room in which the physical

3569.04 --> 3575.92
exists how can you use physics

3573.04 --> 3575.92
you know what i mean

3577.52 --> 3582.559
right the volume

3579.2 --> 3585.1189999999997
contains the material

3582.559 --> 3588.2400000000002
spatial dynamics and looping is about

3585.119 --> 3591.28
the volume and how it is arranged

3588.24 --> 3593.04
what is the space available and how

3591.28 --> 3595.44
physics

3593.04 --> 3597.839
don't give no [ __ ] about volume yeah you

3595.44 --> 3600.48
might use it in calculations but it it

3597.839 --> 3604.16
deals with the material and the things

3600.48 --> 3606.2400000000002
and the effects inside the volume that

3604.16 --> 3609.2
makes it physics

3606.24 --> 3612.4799999999996
you can't really use physics to explain

3609.2 --> 3612.48
spatial dynamics

3613.52 --> 3618.079
yes you could

3615.28 --> 3619.8390000000004
potentially prove

3618.079 --> 3621.6800000000003
that there is

3619.839 --> 3623.16
looping effects

3621.68 --> 3625.44
spatial

3623.16 --> 3627.359
non-linearity within the available

3625.44 --> 3631.359
volume of the realm that is something

3627.359 --> 3633.2
that is falsifiable you can test whether

3631.359 --> 3636.4
a certain

3633.2 --> 3639.839
setup is or is not

3636.4 --> 3639.839
but that's not physics

3640.0 --> 3646.16
because it's about the volume in itself

3643.92 --> 3647.599
how does that relate to physics it's not

3646.16 --> 3650.24
substance

3647.599 --> 3653.28
it's volume

3650.24 --> 3653.2799999999997
it's available space

3654.799 --> 3657.799
see

3667.68 --> 3671.2799999999997
man today

3669.04 --> 3674.48
today's show turned out really great

3671.28 --> 3674.48
even though it was kind of short

3679.119 --> 3683.559
hey hello by the way stone monkey

3698.88 --> 3701.88
hmm

3719.76 --> 3723.039
all right oh yeah and to that question

3722.24 --> 3725.359
could

3723.039 --> 3727.28
humans someday replicate it and create

3725.359 --> 3730.5589999999997
their own loops

3727.28 --> 3730.559
yeah potentially

3730.64 --> 3734.0789999999997
i don't know what the consequences of

3732.48 --> 3737.039
that would be what happens when you

3734.079 --> 3737.039
actually start to

3738.839 --> 3744.24
manipulate the space

3742.079 --> 3746.4
in which you exist

3744.24 --> 3749.4399999999996
like that could have some

3746.4 --> 3751.76
bad side effects

3749.44 --> 3754.079
but yeah it might be possible it would

3751.76 --> 3757.079
be considered like a wormhole or a

3754.079 --> 3757.079
portal

3775.2 --> 3778.3999999999996
right also because

3777.44 --> 3781.119
well

3778.4 --> 3783.359
even more so

3781.119 --> 3784.559
think of it like this

3783.359 --> 3787.92
if

3784.559 --> 3790.1600000000003
we were living in a realm that has a

3787.92 --> 3792.64
provable loop

3790.16 --> 3795.359
then that means that every part of the

3792.64 --> 3799.68
realm is basically in a loop

3795.359 --> 3799.68
and thus basically mechanically

3800.559 --> 3803.079
in

3802.24 --> 3805.52
what

3803.079 --> 3808.319
mathematicians and all that have worked

3805.52 --> 3809.52
out to be a wormhole like we would be in

3808.319 --> 3811.52
a closed

3809.52 --> 3813.839
looped wormhole

3811.52 --> 3816.0
or if

3813.839 --> 3818.799
if we had

3816.0 --> 3820.96
that knowledge then maybe

3818.799 --> 3822.72
for example you could

3820.96 --> 3825.839
shorten that loop

3822.72 --> 3828.72
right if the entire thing is

3825.839 --> 3831.599
a loop then maybe you could

3828.72 --> 3832.8799999999997
manipulate the way that loop works

3831.599 --> 3835.28
right but yeah

3832.88 --> 3838.6400000000003
what if that results in oh we're going

3835.28 --> 3840.3190000000004
to try to shorten the loop from here to

3838.64 --> 3842.64
there and then you do it and then

3840.319 --> 3845.0389999999998
suddenly you end up in a world where

3842.64 --> 3847.2
literally half the realm is subtly

3845.039 --> 3849.44
disintegrated it doesn't exist anymore

3847.2 --> 3851.4399999999996
because the loop has been shortened for

3849.44 --> 3853.52
the entire realm

3851.44 --> 3855.119
it would just be gone

3853.52 --> 3857.599
big chunks is that

3855.119 --> 3860.2400000000002
right that might happen

3857.599 --> 3860.2400000000002
i don't know

3861.28 --> 3865.119
i mean what's gonna happen when you

3863.2 --> 3866.8799999999997
literally interfere

3865.119 --> 3869.28
with the space

3866.88 --> 3870.4
that you are in

3869.28 --> 3874.44
right

3870.4 --> 3874.44
could be extremely dangerous

3891.039 --> 3895.2000000000003
does time behave different near or

3893.119 --> 3897.44
through the loops well not that i know

3895.2 --> 3897.4399999999996
of

3900.16 --> 3904.64
but yeah time is not even really a thing

3902.16 --> 3908.3999999999996
it's more like does entropy has the same

3904.64 --> 3911.0389999999998
speed in every part of available space

3908.4 --> 3911.039
i don't know

3911.28 --> 3915.76
maybe there are parts where it goes

3913.119 --> 3917.28
faster or slower

3915.76 --> 3919.44
right because that's really what it is

3917.28 --> 3921.52
the the way

3919.44 --> 3923.68
how quickly

3921.52 --> 3926.24
physical things react

3923.68 --> 3928.72
that's what we recognize as time now if

3926.24 --> 3930.16
we would theoretically

3928.72 --> 3932.0789999999997
consider

3930.16 --> 3934.3999999999996
what would happen if it speed up or sped

3932.079 --> 3935.599
down what effectively would how that

3934.4 --> 3939.44
would be

3935.599 --> 3939.44
it would be entropy and its speed

3941.92 --> 3946.2400000000002
because that's how we derive time

3948.16 --> 3952.16
and the celestials both

3958.88 --> 3965.039
near or through the loops yep well

3962.72 --> 3967.2799999999997
i i've you should already have drawn the

3965.039 --> 3969.599
conclusion out of what i said earlier

3967.28 --> 3972.3190000000004
steamy traveler

3969.599 --> 3974.88
because if it is looping that means the

3972.319 --> 3977.359
entire thing is the loop so why would

3974.88 --> 3979.44
you consider that some parts within the

3977.359 --> 3982.4
entire loop would have a different

3979.44 --> 3984.64
apparent speed

3982.4 --> 3987.039
of time

3984.64 --> 3987.0389999999998
shouldn't

3987.76 --> 3993.599
but one could consider that even the

3990.96 --> 3995.68
apparent speed at time could change if

3993.599 --> 3999.44
the entire loop

3995.68 --> 3999.44
of the realm would change

4000.48 --> 4003.799
that could happen

4007.52 --> 4014.079
right so let's just say

4010.079 --> 4015.039
what if the entire realms

4014.079 --> 4016.96
loop

4015.039 --> 4018.88
space

4016.96 --> 4021.359
would increase to double

4018.88 --> 4022.48
and there would be like another realm

4021.359 --> 4025.2799999999997
stuck

4022.48 --> 4028.0
two hours directly connected through the

4025.28 --> 4030.88
loop or maybe that would mean that time

4028.0 --> 4032.559
or the entropy would go twice as fast

4030.88 --> 4035.92
and maybe if

4032.559 --> 4037.44
half the realm suddenly disappeared

4035.92 --> 4039.52
out of the loop

4037.44 --> 4043.039
doesn't exist within the available space

4039.52 --> 4045.28
anymore then maybe time would have

4043.039 --> 4045.28
right

4045.68 --> 4049.839
those are

4046.96 --> 4049.839
basic ideas

4050.48 --> 4057.319
but yeah this is all very science

4052.96 --> 4057.319
fiction territory at this point

4067.2 --> 4072.64
right but i'm gonna round out the show

4069.68 --> 4072.64
it's been interesting

4072.799 --> 4078.16
don't feel sick from the coffee either

4075.28 --> 4078.1600000000003
so yeah

4081.359 --> 4086.48
hope you all enjoyed that i did was very

4084.72 --> 4089.2799999999997
interesting

4086.48 --> 4091.359
so thanks everyone for coming i hope you

4089.28 --> 4093.6800000000003
liked this show if you did then please

4099.04 --> 4102.56
normally 1 p.m amsterdam time in the

4100.88 --> 4104.400000000001
weekdays

4102.56 --> 4106.96
although yeah i'm probably

4104.4 --> 4110.3189999999995
going to be starting more

4106.96 --> 4112.96
right before 2 p.m in this week seems to

4110.319 --> 4115.6
be happening a lot i need to catch up on

4112.96 --> 4119.839
some rest for some reason

4115.6 --> 4119.839
but i'll still be doing the shows

4120.0 --> 4125.199
so make sure to tune in

4122.48 --> 4127.04
right anyway if you liked the video then

4125.199 --> 4129.04
please don't forget to rogan's it up and

4127.04 --> 4130.96
if you haven't already subscribe to my

4129.04 --> 4132.64
channel hit the bell notification so you

4130.96 --> 4134.319
know when i'm going live which is

4132.64 --> 4136.2390000000005
normally 1 pm amsterdam time in the

4134.319 --> 4139.279
weekdays and 2 p.m amsterdam time in the

4136.239 --> 4141.2789999999995
weekend and please also do support me

4139.279 --> 4142.96
through the paypal patreon crypto wallet

4141.279 --> 4146.080000000001
super chat and membership system join

4142.96 --> 4148.64
button that will be much appreciated can

4146.08 --> 4150.48
still use the support

4148.64 --> 4152.319
though i'm doing fine right now

4150.48 --> 4155.919999999999
financially

4152.319 --> 4155.92
never know how long that lasts

4157.199 --> 4159.839
right

4158.08 --> 4161.679
so i will be back tomorrow with flat

4159.839 --> 4163.44
earth early bird number eleven hundred

4161.679 --> 4165.12
and fourteen

4163.44 --> 4167.04
on the wednesday and i'm gonna join the

4165.12 --> 4169.12
flat earth debates which has just now

4167.04 --> 4171.2789999999995
started up the live show

4169.12 --> 4175.54
hope to see y'all there in chat

4171.279 --> 4192.400000000001
and until the next video keep it flat

4175.54 --> 4194.32
[Music]

4192.4 --> 4206.639999999999
so

4194.32 --> 4206.639999999999
[Music]

4215.84 --> 4217.92
you
