96.56 --> 102.96000000000001
right

98.84 --> 102.96000000000001
so weather today

103.759 --> 106.96
is beautiful

108.64 --> 115.84
a couple of fluffy clouds

111.119 --> 115.84
also a couple of trails but

116.079 --> 119.67999999999999
seems to be a lot of planes in the air

117.68 --> 122.71900000000001
not all of them are leaving trails but

119.68 --> 122.71900000000001
some of them are and

122.799 --> 125.119
yeah

125.439 --> 129.51999999999998
but yeah there's

126.719 --> 130.79999999999998
a lot of wind in the air

129.52 --> 134.56
and

130.8 --> 134.56
seems to also be up there

136.4 --> 139.84
so

137.28 --> 142.879
yeah despite having seen some pretty

139.84 --> 146.0
serious trails earlier they seem to have

142.879 --> 146.0
almost dissipated

146.8 --> 149.44
over there

149.76 --> 154.319
right so it's just a really beautiful

151.84 --> 157.519
warm day

154.319 --> 159.51899999999998
i'm in my shorts with sandals

157.519 --> 163.12
and i went out for groceries in that as

159.519 --> 167.12
well and it was just very doable

163.12 --> 167.12
because it is really warm outside

168.239 --> 171.239
beautiful

171.84 --> 178.4
i bet this is like great beach weather

176.08 --> 179.68
although maybe too much wind i mean if

178.4 --> 182.4
it's going to be windy here it's going

179.68 --> 185.36
to be even more windy at the beach so

182.4 --> 189.12
i don't know right

185.36 --> 189.12
hello matthew hall first in chat

189.76 --> 193.28
gray skies and light rain

193.92 --> 199.44
i seem to be getting a lot of good

195.519 --> 202.4
weather here and hearing other people

199.44 --> 204.07999999999998
sometimes rain nathan oakley had rain

202.4 --> 205.68
yesterday i think

204.08 --> 208.48000000000002
too

205.68 --> 210.239
england it's a bit rainy here and there

208.48 --> 213.23899999999998
over here it's overall been just very

210.239 --> 213.239
beautiful

217.519 --> 220.87900000000002
seeking star wars even had snow

219.44 --> 222.72
yesterday

220.879 --> 225.04
when she went to the post office she

222.72 --> 225.04
said

225.68 --> 228.799
hey amanda young

229.28 --> 234.48
it's good to have you back again

232.72 --> 238.28
i wasn't sure if you ever want to come

234.48 --> 238.28
we're going to come back

242.72 --> 250.12
right so it is wednesday the 11th

246.48 --> 250.11999999999998
of may 2022

252.08 --> 255.08
uh

256.639 --> 260.079
that's kind of not going to be a super

258.079 --> 261.199
long show an hour and 20 minutes i

260.079 --> 262.16
estimate

261.199 --> 264.479
but

262.16 --> 266.32000000000005
yeah let's make the best of it

264.479 --> 269.71999999999997
oh jeff gassett

266.32 --> 269.71999999999997
daniel robles

271.84 --> 276.0
kevin k

273.759 --> 276.0
oh

278.88 --> 283.759
right so yeah with this heat i am

280.72 --> 283.759
skipping on the tea

285.52 --> 289.68
but yeah

287.12 --> 291.52
still have a gusto energy drink not sure

289.68 --> 293.52
if i'm gonna open it yet

291.52 --> 294.479
might save it for tomorrow and but i

293.52 --> 297.52
will

294.479 --> 301.03999999999996
definitely have some

297.52 --> 301.03999999999996
blood orange juice

301.6 --> 304.96000000000004
great drink for this heat

305.36 --> 310.52000000000004
and extra vitamin c always good

311.759 --> 317.36
right so how is everybody doing

315.12 --> 319.44
yet yesterday's flat earth debate was

317.36 --> 322.16
really good

319.44 --> 325.16
was very focused very intense everybody

322.16 --> 325.16
was

326.0 --> 330.16
was on high level

327.919 --> 332.15999999999997
uh yeah nathan did round out the after

330.16 --> 333.91900000000004
show a bit early though and we were all

332.16 --> 336.0
very disappointed

333.919 --> 336.84
because we could have easily gone on for

336.0 --> 339.36
another

336.84 --> 342.0
hour i think nathan just didn't really

339.36 --> 342.0
have the time

343.759 --> 346.0
uh

349.199 --> 354.56
oh yeah also kiwi went live again

351.68 --> 356.72
apparently he got his computer fixed

354.56 --> 358.96
there wasn't going to be a ball busters

356.72 --> 361.6
this weekend though but

358.96 --> 363.039
he said that next weekend

361.6 --> 364.84000000000003
it's

363.039 --> 369.84
yeah ball busters will be

364.84 --> 369.84
back and i will be on it when it is

379.36 --> 385.759
so yeah that's good to hear

382.8 --> 388.16
even though i'm saying it myself

385.759 --> 392.36
this is a yeah i do miss ball busters

388.16 --> 392.36
bulbas is a different format

394.88 --> 399.759
and yeah it is also where kiwi is at is

398.639 --> 401.039
best

399.759 --> 403.12
this is

401.039 --> 405.44
and yeah that makes for a very good show

403.12 --> 409.44
a lot of the time so i'm kind of looking

405.44 --> 412.4
forward to ball busters again ah

409.44 --> 412.4
let's see what else

412.479 --> 416.199
was going on yesterday

429.84 --> 436.08
yeah quantum of conscious

432.56 --> 439.759
is really zoning in on the study of

436.08 --> 441.84
false flags situation of crisis acts

439.759 --> 443.52000000000004
he's been doing that a lot recently i

441.84 --> 444.63899999999995
don't i don't really bring him up that

443.52 --> 448.15999999999997
much

444.639 --> 448.16
but it is very interesting

448.56 --> 454.56
what he finds and the way he talks

452.0 --> 454.56
about it

460.08 --> 467.35999999999996
oh yeah jim bob was also alive

464.0 --> 471.44
but yeah that was during qe live so

467.36 --> 471.44
kind of only followed it halfway

472.4 --> 478.599
uh

473.759 --> 478.599
right so yeah that's pretty much it

478.639 --> 483.36
i tried to look on netflix for something

481.039 --> 485.28
interesting but i couldn't find anything

483.36 --> 488.28000000000003
oh is that my camera

485.28 --> 488.28
yep

496.56 --> 499.84
i'm so fluffy

502.16 --> 505.72
hey tony whitcomb

512.32 --> 515.719
hello youtube

530.64 --> 535.8
right

531.6 --> 535.8000000000001
so yeah i'm up for talking

536.08 --> 542.76
about yeah whatever

539.04 --> 542.76
got plenty of energy

549.839 --> 552.839
hmm

574.56 --> 579.1199999999999
rude rainbow

576.8 --> 579.12
what

586.16 --> 590.04
okay tony whitaker

598.32 --> 604.88
oh dear that's jason mccormack sock

603.12 --> 608.36
get out

604.88 --> 608.36
you know the rules

634.399 --> 637.36
right uh

638.959 --> 644.959
i'm hearing some rumblings from the guys

642.079 --> 644.959
fvd guys

645.2 --> 651.44
no mark smiler you're not still bad but

648.0 --> 653.2
if you're gonna be behaving like a crazy

651.44 --> 654.0790000000001
guy which you are

653.2 --> 655.9200000000001
and

654.079 --> 658.56
yeah you can't

655.92 --> 658.56
change that

658.839 --> 663.6
think all right i've been banned

661.44 --> 665.6
everybody

663.6 --> 667.839
if you're going to be acting nutty again

665.6 --> 671.16
then i will just ban you again so it's

667.839 --> 671.1600000000001
up to you

675.2 --> 678.32
uh

676.56 --> 679.1199999999999
thanks for the magnets by the way i've

678.32 --> 682.88
had

679.12 --> 682.88
a couple of fun moments with them

683.279 --> 690.16
but yeah i'm hearing from the guys

686.48 --> 690.16
from the fed panel about

690.48 --> 696.0
how the anti-flat earthers are now

693.2 --> 698.399
trying to basically disconnect coriolis

696.0 --> 703.24
effect

698.399 --> 703.24
like they're trying to find a new way to

706.56 --> 712.0
to basically go

708.24 --> 715.6800000000001
to yeah they're detaching

712.0 --> 720.0
coriolis effect from

715.68 --> 723.1999999999999
3d supposedly onto 2d

720.0 --> 724.959
in order to arc it i don't know i don't

723.2 --> 727.9590000000001
even understand what this is saying

724.959 --> 727.959
really

733.36 --> 736.399
let's just say that

737.2 --> 742.9590000000001
the anti-flat earthers are going weird

740.56 --> 745.8389999999999
on the coriolis effect they're trying

742.959 --> 745.8389999999999
something new

751.61 --> 754.739
[Music]

782.56 --> 785.56
huh

786.24 --> 793.44
it's in 2d a flat plane

789.6 --> 797.16
well it would have to be because it's 2d

793.44 --> 797.1600000000001
do you have gas head

809.839 --> 814.24
what's that link by the way tony

811.279 --> 816.8
whitcomber i'll take a look oh that's

814.24 --> 816.8
your video

816.959 --> 822.8
rainbow kids

819.44 --> 822.8000000000001
root program what

824.399 --> 830.079
holy [ __ ] that's blurry by the way damn

829.199 --> 833.88
that's

830.079 --> 833.88
super shitty quality

846.32 --> 849.32
weird

857.92 --> 863.76
now tear it we shouldn't be

860.0 --> 867.24
start calling each other flat toes no

863.76 --> 867.24
that's annoying

872.399 --> 878.16
closed single reference frames

875.839 --> 882.6
traveling straight

878.16 --> 882.6
okay so uh what

888.8 --> 892.88
okay so the claim from the anti-flat

890.88 --> 896.8389999999999
earthers is

892.88 --> 900.0
closed single reference frames traveling

896.839 --> 902.1600000000001
straight into d

900.0 --> 902.16
i

902.639 --> 906.0790000000001
is

903.76 --> 906.079
what

906.399 --> 910.24
i i don't even understand the claim

909.199 --> 913.8389999999999
anymore

910.24 --> 913.839
just getting so weird

914.639 --> 918.48
they're getting old space-time bendy or

917.279 --> 921.04
something

918.48 --> 924.5600000000001
like that not within

921.04 --> 926.639
the supposed con yeah

924.56 --> 930.1199999999999
the fictional medium but

926.639 --> 930.12
i like that

957.36 --> 961.44
right

958.56 --> 964.6389999999999
drawing a 2d line and then claiming it's

961.44 --> 967.639
a globe okay

964.639 --> 967.639
yeah

968.959 --> 976.5999999999999
i think they might have

971.68 --> 976.5999999999999
dabbled in too much autographic view

1020.72 --> 1025.679
anyway that's going on apparently

1023.759 --> 1027.919
i'm sure we're gonna hear more about it

1025.679 --> 1031.76
on the flat earth debate

1027.919 --> 1031.76
it should go live in about an hour

1032.079 --> 1035.079
hmm

1049.12 --> 1052.3999999999999
pronounce

1050.24 --> 1056.16
plato like no

1052.4 --> 1056.16
yeah but that makes no sense

1057.2 --> 1062.52
i'm not a flato thanks steroid

1073.52 --> 1077.2
no

1074.48 --> 1077.2
no teret

1077.36 --> 1081.32
i'm sorry no

1090.03 --> 1093.18
[Music]

1102.88 --> 1106.72
adam's video on gravity

1105.28 --> 1110.48
good

1106.72 --> 1112.24
crap because the iss falling right well

1110.48 --> 1115.3600000000001
they're claiming for some reason that

1112.24 --> 1117.84
there's microgravity on the iss

1115.36 --> 1117.84
remember

1119.52 --> 1124.559
even though yeah that doesn't actually

1122.24 --> 1126.96
make any sense

1124.559 --> 1130.32
when you look at the supposed live

1126.96 --> 1132.64
iss streams where they're hanging

1130.32 --> 1135.36
but i've heard plenty of times like no

1132.64 --> 1136.96
no the iss is in

1135.36 --> 1138.799
at the height where there is

1136.96 --> 1141.28
microgravity

1138.799 --> 1141.28
okay

1143.039 --> 1146.84
thanks for all the contradictions

1185.36 --> 1191.12
the truth of the globe is a straight

1188.48 --> 1194.88
line single reference frame closed

1191.12 --> 1194.8799999999999
system oneness

1199.919 --> 1205.3200000000002
sorry i'm

1201.2 --> 1205.32
reading two chats now

1223.2 --> 1230.559
centripetal force is garbage no it's not

1226.96 --> 1233.52
centripetal force definitely exists

1230.559 --> 1235.28
it just doesn't happen

1233.52 --> 1238.1589999999999
with the earth we're standing on because

1235.28 --> 1240.559
it is stationary but centripetal force

1238.159 --> 1242.7990000000002
definitely exists

1240.559 --> 1246.9189999999999
when stuff goes spinning oh yeah there's

1242.799 --> 1246.9189999999999
centripetal force all right

1257.44 --> 1260.44
um

1275.84 --> 1281.3799999999999
mm-hmm

1278.19 --> 1281.38
[Music]

1312.159 --> 1316.3200000000002
there isn't a force to no there is

1316.559 --> 1321.44
hold on now look spitting things

1319.84 --> 1324.559
definitely have centrifugal and

1321.44 --> 1327.1200000000001
centripetal force those effects

1324.559 --> 1330.0
definitely do exist

1327.12 --> 1331.4399999999998
it just doesn't happen on earth

1330.0 --> 1333.679
with the earth

1331.44 --> 1337.72
and things in relation to the earth

1333.679 --> 1337.72
right because it's not spinning

1382.0 --> 1386.64
just push up on your feet when you stand

1384.64 --> 1389.1200000000001
on the floor what

1386.64 --> 1392.96
now i think youtube i think that what

1389.12 --> 1395.52
you're referencing is like the standard

1392.96 --> 1396.799
like the newtonian mechanic approach

1395.52 --> 1398.559
that's how i learned it's like oh

1396.799 --> 1400.4
there's a force one way and then there's

1398.559 --> 1402.799
the force the other way and then they

1400.4 --> 1405.6000000000001
balance out and right

1402.799 --> 1407.52
so you have your weight or you could

1405.6 --> 1410.48
call it relative density

1407.52 --> 1413.12
of course but if your weight it pushes

1410.48 --> 1414.64
down and then the floor has like tensile

1413.12 --> 1417.4399999999998
strength

1414.64 --> 1419.919
and it's rigid and it pushes back and

1417.44 --> 1422.0800000000002
then the equation evens out and nothing

1419.919 --> 1423.44
moves nothing breaks

1422.08 --> 1424.559
right

1423.44 --> 1426.72
that's how i

1424.559 --> 1430.24
originally learned that in school in

1426.72 --> 1433.679
physics class early on

1430.24 --> 1437.1200000000001
it's conceptual the kind of like oh

1433.679 --> 1438.159
feel the forces see what's happening in

1437.12 --> 1440.3999999999999
your mind

1438.159 --> 1440.4
but

1441.52 --> 1446.8799999999999
yeah of course based

1443.279 --> 1446.88
within newtonian mechanics

1456.96 --> 1462.799
is there any other reason the sky is

1458.88 --> 1462.7990000000002
blue besides the firmament

1463.12 --> 1468.4799999999998
wow

1465.279 --> 1472.6
why do you say the sky is blue because

1468.48 --> 1472.6
of the firmament andrew

1473.279 --> 1479.039
what's the firmament

1474.96 --> 1479.039
why are you assuming it has a color

1479.36 --> 1486.039
why are you assuming you could see it

1482.559 --> 1486.039
at that distance

1505.44 --> 1510.48
magic pushing floor

1507.76 --> 1512.96
yeah but it's not literally a push right

1510.48 --> 1516.0
the arrows are

1512.96 --> 1517.2
symbols right they're symbols of

1516.0 --> 1519.12
upward

1517.2 --> 1521.279
counter strength and the force of

1519.12 --> 1522.8799999999999
gravity or the weight

1521.279 --> 1527.12
and that's how they show it in the

1522.88 --> 1527.1200000000001
diagrams it's not literally like that

1527.84 --> 1533.84
it's a balancing out equation that's

1530.72 --> 1533.84
what it's really about

1539.6 --> 1543.84
so the tensile strength

1544.48 --> 1551.279
it's not literally upwards but

1547.679 --> 1551.279
it hold it's basically

1553.679 --> 1558.64
what do you call that

1555.84 --> 1559.9189999999999
sideways anyway it's trying to move

1558.64 --> 1561.919
apart

1559.919 --> 1564.0800000000002
but it can't because it's too rigid and

1561.919 --> 1565.279
there's tensile strength and that

1564.08 --> 1568.559
prevents

1565.279 --> 1572.32
that counterbalances that absorbs

1568.559 --> 1573.76
the force or weight

1572.32 --> 1576.32
the pushing relative density this

1573.76 --> 1578.24
equilibrium push of the not moving

1576.32 --> 1579.6789999999999
object that is in a medium that is less

1578.24 --> 1582.0
dense than it

1579.679 --> 1583.8400000000001
right so the object's going down

1582.0 --> 1587.039
and then the tensile strength is more

1583.84 --> 1588.32
going sideways

1587.039 --> 1591.2
right but

1588.32 --> 1592.8799999999999
in that formula with the arrows which is

1591.2 --> 1595.52
kind of newtonian yeah it's going to be

1592.88 --> 1597.3600000000001
up arrow down arrow that's how they show

1595.52 --> 1600.32
that

1597.36 --> 1600.32
it's not literal

1600.4 --> 1606.159
it's a conceptual representation

1603.279 --> 1610.679
to kind of get you going to figure it

1606.159 --> 1610.679
out in your mind what's happening there

1612.64 --> 1617.76
i actually inquired at these types of

1614.96 --> 1622.919
details at the time in school when i got

1617.76 --> 1622.919
that and yeah this is what it is

1646.32 --> 1649.52
and dark u

1650.24 --> 1655.08
it appears to be blue what

1656.08 --> 1660.72
you do

1657.12 --> 1663.4399999999998
you think that the night sky is

1660.72 --> 1663.44
dark blue

1666.08 --> 1673.039
i don't know about that looks pretty

1669.039 --> 1673.039
just straightforward black to me

1678.72 --> 1684.159
it's not like oh the the blue is

1681.84 --> 1686.799
constantly darkening

1684.159 --> 1690.159
when the sun goes away no it it actually

1686.799 --> 1690.1589999999999
does kind of change color

1691.12 --> 1696.8799999999999
it really does just become black not

1693.44 --> 1700.679
very very very dark blue i disagree with

1696.88 --> 1700.679
you there andrew

1719.44 --> 1723.799
who's an air what no

1730.64 --> 1734.159
sunlight

1732.08 --> 1737.52
electrically yeah

1734.159 --> 1740.96
i think so i think that that look

1737.52 --> 1743.2
there's literally holograms right there

1740.96 --> 1746.88
the sun included right

1743.2 --> 1749.6000000000001
that's probably gonna have an effect

1746.88 --> 1752.88
and then oh they go away and suddenly

1749.6 --> 1754.399
the colors all change so yeah whatever

1752.88 --> 1758.64
the sun

1754.399 --> 1758.6399999999999
is how however it manifests

1758.96 --> 1764.559
there seems to be a component and it's

1761.36 --> 1765.36
either separate or it's directly linked

1764.559 --> 1766.96
in

1765.36 --> 1769.039
in a way

1766.96 --> 1770.799
cyclically it seems to be like that it

1769.039 --> 1772.08
seems to be directly tied as to where

1770.799 --> 1773.9189999999999
the sun is

1772.08 --> 1777.039
specifically

1773.919 --> 1780.039
angular wise in relation to the position

1777.039 --> 1780.039
apparent

1780.24 --> 1782.48
but

1783.52 --> 1786.72
why it is that color

1787.84 --> 1794.9599999999998
i can't really say i don't really know

1793.12 --> 1797.9189999999999
like why would

1794.96 --> 1800.159
light effects cause it to be blue like

1797.919 --> 1800.159
that

1801.919 --> 1805.44
and

1802.88 --> 1809.5200000000002
just why would you assume that

1805.44 --> 1812.0
you can see at that kind of a distance

1809.52 --> 1815.36
that color right remember

1812.0 --> 1817.52
even during the daytime the day

1815.36 --> 1819.76
not the night the day

1817.52 --> 1823.44
you go up some kind of balloon or

1819.76 --> 1825.36
something remember the black comes back

1823.44 --> 1826.24
and suddenly you have like this blue

1825.36 --> 1828.1589999999999
part

1826.24 --> 1830.64
and then it's black above

1828.159 --> 1832.88
during the day

1830.64 --> 1832.88
so

1833.039 --> 1837.76
if you can see that during the day then

1835.44 --> 1841.2
you can be damn well sure you're not

1837.76 --> 1842.64
looking at the ceiling an object that is

1841.2 --> 1844.72
blue somehow

1842.64 --> 1846.72
because when you go up

1844.72 --> 1848.88
that blue goes away

1846.72 --> 1850.559
so that's not a blue object you're

1848.88 --> 1854.679
looking at you really

1850.559 --> 1854.6789999999999
gotta think this through better

1874.559 --> 1880.6399999999999
no but you're not listening andrew

1879.2 --> 1883.039
when you go up

1880.64 --> 1886.0800000000002
that blue is not there during the day

1883.039 --> 1887.36
when the sun is right there okay

1886.08 --> 1891.72
so

1887.36 --> 1891.7199999999998
it's just not what that is

1893.919 --> 1898.3990000000001
you're not looking at a blue colored

1895.919 --> 1900.3990000000001
ceiling that happens to be lit up that's

1898.399 --> 1903.36
not what that is

1900.399 --> 1905.84
if it would be that then you would go up

1903.36 --> 1908.32
and you wouldn't have some black

1905.84 --> 1911.8799999999999
darkness appear above you again that

1908.32 --> 1911.8799999999999
makes no sense

1930.48 --> 1935.24
yo youtube what are you talking about

1948.64 --> 1952.88
really scattering i've heard of that

1950.559 --> 1952.8799999999999
yeah

1961.44 --> 1967.0
yes i know youtube

1963.36 --> 1967.0
i realized that

1980.0 --> 1985.279
so yeah how does real really scattering

1985.76 --> 1989.44
like

1987.039 --> 1991.919
reinforce the case that you're looking

1989.44 --> 1995.039
at a blue object physically up there

1991.919 --> 1997.039
seriously and then you go up and oh look

1995.039 --> 1998.64
it's not now it's all black up there and

1997.039 --> 2002.399
it's blue down there

1998.64 --> 2002.3990000000001
explain that to me how does that

2002.559 --> 2005.519
like

2003.679 --> 2008.799
how does rayleigh scattering then

2005.519 --> 2010.559
reinforce that notion that there's a

2008.799 --> 2012.799
supposed blue firmament that you're

2010.559 --> 2014.1589999999999
looking at because the sun is shining on

2012.799 --> 2017.1589999999999
it serious that

2014.159 --> 2017.159
no

2018.399 --> 2021.6
but

2019.2 --> 2025.1200000000001
yeah there might definitely be another

2021.6 --> 2029.039
effect where the sunlight manifestation

2025.12 --> 2029.039
simply causes it to be blue

2029.6 --> 2034.08
like that it's the air that makes it

2031.76 --> 2034.08
blue

2034.399 --> 2038.2399999999998
perhaps

2035.84 --> 2041.039
right maybe it is the air that actually

2038.24 --> 2041.039
makes it blue

2043.679 --> 2048.96
kind of like as if yeah when light

2046.24 --> 2050.879
shines through water

2048.96 --> 2054.32
like the oceans and there's salt in

2050.879 --> 2054.3199999999997
there it becomes green

2054.72 --> 2058.399
so

2056.0 --> 2060.48
maybe it's simply just the general air

2058.399 --> 2061.5989999999997
just makes it blue

2060.48 --> 2064.159
and that

2061.599 --> 2068.32
also is very telling that in like for

2064.159 --> 2071.359
example industrial cities or wherever

2068.32 --> 2075.839
where it's really shitty air quality

2071.359 --> 2075.839
that it usually just isn't all that blue

2076.96 --> 2082.32
because it's not

2078.32 --> 2082.32
the regular clean air

2087.2 --> 2090.6389999999997
no

2088.079 --> 2093.76
flatter sage

2090.639 --> 2096.159
it's not waters above reflecting that's

2093.76 --> 2098.8
suggesting a physical object that you're

2096.159 --> 2101.359
looking at

2098.8 --> 2104.32
if it were that and you would go up

2101.359 --> 2107.839
there would not certainly be all black

2104.32 --> 2107.839
above you it makes no sense

2113.28 --> 2117.2000000000003
like you're not looking that or you're

2115.68 --> 2120.72
not seeing

2117.2 --> 2123.9199999999996
what is up there you're not seeing

2120.72 --> 2126.72
the barrier or the end of space whatever

2123.92 --> 2130.6800000000003
it is the container limit you're not

2126.72 --> 2130.68
seeing that that's impossible

2130.72 --> 2136.56
it's too far away and every observation

2133.839 --> 2137.44
just goes shows you like

2136.56 --> 2139.2
no

2137.44 --> 2140.48
whatever you think you're looking at

2139.2 --> 2145.0789999999997
it's not

2140.48 --> 2145.079
a physical thing you're looking at

2145.2 --> 2151.2799999999997
because if it were

2147.44 --> 2153.52
then you'd have all the signs of that

2151.28 --> 2155.6800000000003
and it wouldn't just go black all of a

2153.52 --> 2159.839
sudden if you go high up

2155.68 --> 2159.839
during the day it makes no sense

2171.04 --> 2175.7599999999998
and it seemed to stop at a certain dis

2173.2 --> 2177.68
yeah i i've seen that myself i've done

2175.76 --> 2180.2400000000002
that

2177.68 --> 2183.04
that's a limit to sight yeah that's

2180.24 --> 2184.9599999999996
perspective the laser is in the same

2183.04 --> 2187.599
smaller smaller and then at some points

2184.96 --> 2190.7200000000003
like

2187.599 --> 2190.7200000000003
you can't see it anymore

2193.04 --> 2197.04
yep

2194.24 --> 2197.04
that's what happens

2199.68 --> 2203.359
and you could think like oh that that

2201.839 --> 2206.0
point

2203.359 --> 2208.0
where it seems like it's stopping

2206.0 --> 2210.96
because you can't see it anymore oh

2208.0 --> 2213.92
that's because it's hitting something

2210.96 --> 2216.48
and the hitting something is preventing

2213.92 --> 2217.52
that line from seeming to go on and on

2216.48 --> 2218.48
forever

2217.52 --> 2221.28
yeah

2218.48 --> 2223.2
that's the internal brain argument about

2221.28 --> 2225.3590000000004
that

2223.2 --> 2226.839
but it's basically a

2225.359 --> 2229.2799999999997
horizon

2226.839 --> 2231.119
geometric reification again

2229.28 --> 2232.5600000000004
just like oh i'm looking at the horizon

2231.119 --> 2233.92
oh things

2232.56 --> 2236.4
can't see

2233.92 --> 2238.56
things entirely it must be because the

2236.4 --> 2239.839
geometry is blocking it right

2238.56 --> 2242.0789999999997
if you're going to point the laser

2239.839 --> 2244.4
upwards and see like oh wait i can't see

2242.079 --> 2246.88
that point it's almost like it's

2244.4 --> 2249.28
touching a dome

2246.88 --> 2252.079
it's again thinking oh

2249.28 --> 2254.5600000000004
the perspective pure optical thing that

2252.079 --> 2257.76
makes me not see it anymore

2254.56 --> 2258.96
is physically obstructed

2257.76 --> 2261.8390000000004
see

2258.96 --> 2264.64
it's basically a geometric horizon

2261.839 --> 2268.64
reification again except

2264.64 --> 2268.64
now with a laser in the sky

2268.8 --> 2271.8390000000004
think about it

2274.64 --> 2278.24
could you get a balloon above the blue

2276.4 --> 2280.48
sky yes

2278.24 --> 2283.04
there's been many like

2280.48 --> 2283.839
balloon launches with cameras and all

2283.04 --> 2288.0
that

2283.839 --> 2288.0
that did go above the blue sky

2288.4 --> 2294.56
or well above is comple like it seems

2291.52 --> 2297.359
like it gets stuck half on half

2294.56 --> 2298.88
so there will be blue below the horizon

2297.359 --> 2301.92
because the horizon is still going to be

2298.88 --> 2304.2400000000002
at eye level and then black above that

2301.92 --> 2306.96
sort of thing

2304.24 --> 2306.9599999999996
so not

2307.28 --> 2311.119
you're not going to see the blue

2308.88 --> 2314.6400000000003
literally drop away until it's like a

2311.119 --> 2314.6400000000003
blue thing in the distance

2315.28 --> 2320.4
but why is it black above well because

2317.92 --> 2323.119
you're not looking at a blue object

2320.4 --> 2325.44
that's being lit by the sun

2323.119 --> 2328.6400000000003
and that's why you're seeing blue that's

2325.44 --> 2329.68
why you're seeing black instead above

2328.64 --> 2332.16
right

2329.68 --> 2334.16
to emphasize that that's not what you're

2332.16 --> 2335.5989999999997
looking at you don't know what you're

2334.16 --> 2338.16
looking at

2335.599 --> 2340.079
you don't know directly why it's blue

2338.16 --> 2344.48
you could reason it out but you're

2340.079 --> 2346.32
definitely not looking at a lit up blue

2344.48 --> 2348.2400000000002
material

2346.32 --> 2349.92
where light is literally bouncing off

2348.24 --> 2354.52
and then reflecting back into your right

2349.92 --> 2354.52
that's not what you're seeing right now

2371.04 --> 2376.56
the blue up what no

2373.44 --> 2376.56
no blue object

2380.16 --> 2384.8799999999997
that's my point it's not a blue object

2382.64 --> 2388.0789999999997
you're looking at you're not looking at

2384.88 --> 2388.079
a dome that's blue

2388.48 --> 2393.599
it's an effect

2391.359 --> 2397.48
it's not an object that's reflecting

2393.599 --> 2397.48
light back to your eye

2424.56 --> 2427.599
like rainbows

2431.52 --> 2438.16
no maybe adjacent

2434.48 --> 2439.599
right rainbow is much more traceable

2438.16 --> 2443.1189999999997
it's a direct

2439.599 --> 2446.48
holographic luminary effect right it's

2443.119 --> 2449.92
directly because of the holographic sun

2446.48 --> 2449.92
that it happens like that

2451.28 --> 2456.3190000000004
so you can really trace the source

2453.68 --> 2458.0
when it comes to well the blue of the

2456.319 --> 2460.72
sky

2458.0 --> 2462.96
we have associations the association the

2460.72 --> 2467.1189999999997
main one would be the sun

2462.96 --> 2468.48
it seems to be present when it's blue

2467.119 --> 2469.44
right

2468.48 --> 2472.0
at least

2469.44 --> 2473.52
down here but

2472.0 --> 2477.48
that's about it

2473.52 --> 2477.48
it's it's only correlatory

2491.44 --> 2497.2000000000003
it's it's just like the daylight in the

2494.24 --> 2501.1189999999997
bible right daylight separate

2497.2 --> 2503.52
daylight nighttime separate from

2501.119 --> 2507.88
the sun moon and stars

2503.52 --> 2507.88
and the wandering stars the planets

2515.68 --> 2518.68
uh

2536.89 --> 2540.06
[Music]

2553.599 --> 2558.7200000000003
so yeah i hope i cleared that all up for

2555.76 --> 2558.7200000000003
everybody watching

2560.079 --> 2565.8390000000004
most of the wrenches seem to kind of

2562.079 --> 2565.8390000000004
like drop to the background

2630.0 --> 2633.24
all right

2642.319 --> 2645.8
anything else

2651.359 --> 2657.319
blue dome project okay hello canada bear

2680.72 --> 2684.72
light scattering is blue

2687.44 --> 2691.599
okay

2688.56 --> 2694.64
makes sense so it is the air itself then

2691.599 --> 2697.92
right i yeah even put that forth in my

2694.64 --> 2697.92
argumentation earlier

2699.28 --> 2705.92
because yeah why else would it not be

2702.48 --> 2708.64
blue anymore when you go up really high

2705.92 --> 2709.6800000000003
why wouldn't b blew up there but it is

2708.64 --> 2711.5989999999997
down

2709.68 --> 2713.1189999999997
there

2711.599 --> 2716.6400000000003
when you're high up

2713.119 --> 2719.839
that's because most of the air is there

2716.64 --> 2721.44
there's a lot more stuff more pressure

2719.839 --> 2722.96
more scattering

2721.44 --> 2724.64
i guess

2722.96 --> 2729.64
all right jeff

2724.64 --> 2729.64
well that kind of solves it then sword

2786.16 --> 2792.16
during sunset different chemical

2788.24 --> 2794.3999999999996
compounds are present yeah andrew

2792.16 --> 2796.64
but it's of course because

2794.4 --> 2797.76
yeah

2796.64 --> 2799.92
other

2797.76 --> 2802.8
irregular gases like

2799.92 --> 2805.839
chemical based gases a lot of them will

2802.8 --> 2808.319
kind of like not

2805.839 --> 2810.24
really launch off and spread in all

2808.319 --> 2812.64
directions as much because they're much

2810.24 --> 2813.9199999999996
denser than the average gas so they will

2812.64 --> 2816.7999999999997
typically

2813.92 --> 2820.079
as they're being produced hang much

2816.8 --> 2820.88
lower to the ground

2820.079 --> 2824.079
right

2820.88 --> 2827.359
so yeah if the sun then sets

2824.079 --> 2830.079
then it gets to shine through that layer

2827.359 --> 2832.24
and and dust and there all kinds of

2830.079 --> 2834.079
things that are much more present close

2832.24 --> 2836.319
to the ground than

2834.079 --> 2839.3590000000004
a bit higher up

2836.319 --> 2841.2799999999997
so then yeah this the sun or disguise at

2839.359 --> 2842.72
least does become a different color

2841.28 --> 2846.88
because of that

2842.72 --> 2846.8799999999997
could be like orange or pink

2847.119 --> 2851.52
right that sort of those sort of colors

2848.96 --> 2851.52
typically

2855.04 --> 2860.0
it's because the gases are different

2857.599 --> 2861.92
when it's very close to the ground and

2860.0 --> 2863.599
that's where the sun

2861.92 --> 2867.76
is basically

2863.599 --> 2869.3590000000004
shining towards you at from angular-wise

2867.76 --> 2873.8390000000004
as it gets

2869.359 --> 2873.839
as it disappears into the horizon

2881.28 --> 2886.88
and becomes even more interesting too

2883.92 --> 2890.0
right if you get with the color

2886.88 --> 2892.6400000000003
schemes that typically happen

2890.0 --> 2894.96
like there's a sunset oh look the sky is

2892.64 --> 2896.7999999999997
all pink oh look the clouds are all pink

2894.96 --> 2898.2400000000002
yet have you ever seen that i have

2896.8 --> 2900.8
plenty of times i think it's kind of

2898.24 --> 2902.64
beautiful i like that color of pink

2900.8 --> 2904.4
that's actually

2902.64 --> 2906.4
yeah and it's because it's holographic

2904.4 --> 2908.8
of course from the sun it just had it's

2906.4 --> 2911.599
pretty magical

2908.8 --> 2915.6800000000003
but if you then like

2911.599 --> 2917.04
quickly get into a private jet and

2915.68 --> 2919.5989999999997
move on

2917.04 --> 2922.96
like several

2919.599 --> 2922.96
hours like oh yeah

2923.92 --> 2929.64
you fly very quickly what would it be uh

2929.68 --> 2935.04
westward

2932.319 --> 2937.2
and suddenly sun

2935.04 --> 2939.44
appears to go back

2937.2 --> 2941.52
in relation to you back up from the

2939.44 --> 2943.44
horizon and all the colors are all

2941.52 --> 2946.72
different there

2943.44 --> 2948.48
now it's just regular blue again

2946.72 --> 2949.9199999999996
right

2948.48 --> 2951.92
so

2949.92 --> 2953.839
looking from one vantage point it's like

2951.92 --> 2956.319
everything is pink now everything

2953.839 --> 2957.2799999999997
because that sun's shining through that

2956.319 --> 2959.44
layer

2957.28 --> 2962.079
close to the horizon

2959.44 --> 2964.7200000000003
but somewhere else

2962.079 --> 2967.119
like what is it a hundred miles to the

2964.72 --> 2970.3999999999996
to the west or something oh

2967.119 --> 2972.1600000000003
now everything isn't all pink it's just

2970.4 --> 2975.28
blue

2972.16 --> 2977.5989999999997
even into the distance right so

2975.28 --> 2977.599
yeah

2977.92 --> 2981.48
so pretty amazing

2990.88 --> 2994.96
yeah and sorry if i keep saying word

2992.88 --> 2997.2000000000003
atmosphere it's really

2994.96 --> 3000.16
hard to get that word out when i say

2997.2 --> 3002.64
atmosphere i just mean the the gas is

3000.16 --> 3002.64
present

3004.64 --> 3010.72
definitely not as fair

3007.839 --> 3015.48
it's just tough for me to just say atmo

3010.72 --> 3015.48
or something it just feels

3076.64 --> 3080.72
the celestial plane what

3081.68 --> 3084.319
no

3082.48 --> 3086.319
no cana bear

3084.319 --> 3088.64
no

3086.319 --> 3090.24
that's no you're wrong

3088.64 --> 3092.0789999999997
it's not a plane

3090.24 --> 3094.0789999999997
a celestial

3092.079 --> 3096.48
plane as you say that's incorrect it's

3094.079 --> 3098.319
not a plane

3096.48 --> 3100.88
right

3098.319 --> 3102.5589999999997
the celestials the stars they are

3100.88 --> 3106.0
definitely

3102.559 --> 3110.96
at a very specific angular relation

3106.0 --> 3114.0
and they will appear to you as a sphere

3110.96 --> 3117.04
not as a sheet

3114.0 --> 3117.04
that covers you

3117.119 --> 3120.88
because then there would be perspective

3119.52 --> 3123.44
effects

3120.88 --> 3127.28
to those celestial lights as they move

3123.44 --> 3128.4
into the distance they would slow down

3127.28 --> 3130.88
yeah

3128.4 --> 3133.52
but that's not what we see we see it as

3130.88 --> 3135.839
an exact sphere that's just angular

3133.52 --> 3138.8
perfection even at the horizon

3135.839 --> 3140.64
if it were a sheet that were covering us

3138.8 --> 3142.079
moving

3140.64 --> 3143.5989999999997
then things

3142.079 --> 3146.48
the stars that would approach the

3143.599 --> 3147.44
horizon would like exponentially slow

3146.48 --> 3149.28
down

3147.44 --> 3151.44
in their angular rate

3149.28 --> 3152.48
because it's actually you're looking at

3151.44 --> 3154.64
a sheet

3152.48 --> 3156.64
a flat sheet that would be covering us

3154.64 --> 3158.96
that's not what we see

3156.64 --> 3162.319
it's a demisphere that's how it appears

3158.96 --> 3166.16
to us it's a holographic demisphere

3162.319 --> 3168.079
the celestial plane is a map making tool

3166.16 --> 3170.48
derivative

3168.079 --> 3170.48
you see

3171.359 --> 3175.52
it's

3172.88 --> 3178.8
easy to do because what they do is they

3175.52 --> 3180.88
coordinate where specific celestials are

3178.8 --> 3182.1600000000003
exactly above you

3180.88 --> 3183.76
and then

3182.16 --> 3185.359
type in those

3183.76 --> 3188.079
points down

3185.359 --> 3191.04
on the earth on the map

3188.079 --> 3192.319
and keep doing that and eventually they

3191.04 --> 3196.5589999999997
will get

3192.319 --> 3199.2
parallel constructed planes out of that

3196.559 --> 3201.92
that's what the celestial plane is about

3199.2 --> 3203.2799999999997
it's a parallel construction

3201.92 --> 3204.88
by taking

3203.28 --> 3208.2400000000002
the star's

3204.88 --> 3210.559
position when it's exactly above you and

3208.24 --> 3211.839
then parallel constructed with the earth

3210.559 --> 3212.6400000000003
map

3211.839 --> 3215.2
right

3212.64 --> 3218.0789999999997
but it's not a plane

3215.2 --> 3221.04
it's not literally a sheet of stars that

3218.079 --> 3224.48
are parallel to the earth

3221.04 --> 3224.48
that would be a reification

3224.88 --> 3229.6800000000003
there would be perspective effects that

3226.72 --> 3231.359
would be applying to the celestials

3229.68 --> 3233.2
and they don't

3231.359 --> 3236.24
that that doesn't exist in this realm we

3233.2 --> 3238.319
don't observe that

3236.24 --> 3241.2
it's a demi sphere not a plane not

3238.319 --> 3244.24
actually a plane but there is a map

3241.2 --> 3248.839
making tool for navigation

3244.24 --> 3248.839
that is a celestial plane though

3262.96 --> 3268.64
the gp altitudes no they have no actual

3266.48 --> 3270.64
altitude

3268.64 --> 3274.16
the celestials don't have an actual

3270.64 --> 3274.16
altitude that's just a

3275.28 --> 3279.8390000000004
a math thing

3277.68 --> 3281.839
they have no actual distance you see

3279.839 --> 3284.4
cana bear

3281.839 --> 3287.52
it's a they're holograms they don't have

3284.4 --> 3287.52
actual positions

3287.76 --> 3292.96
they only have

3289.44 --> 3294.559
very distinct angular

3292.96 --> 3297.68
relations

3294.559 --> 3300.559
towards observers

3297.68 --> 3303.96
at a very specific linear rate

3300.559 --> 3303.96
over the earth

3317.839 --> 3323.119
right and for the whole flat

3320.799 --> 3326.24
celestial map

3323.119 --> 3328.4
yeah you just set a distance but it's

3326.24 --> 3331.1189999999997
arbitrary it's it's not

3328.4 --> 3333.44
relevant to the process of making that

3331.119 --> 3336.079
celestial map

3333.44 --> 3340.319
into a flat plane

3336.079 --> 3340.319
the distance is completely irrelevant

3347.599 --> 3349.839
anyway

3362.16 --> 3366.72
what what are you talking about andrew

3368.319 --> 3374.839
the senior radio art

3371.28 --> 3374.8390000000004
part of what

3376.72 --> 3382.319
what radioactive particles what do you

3379.44 --> 3385.88
mean thinner radioactive particles that

3382.319 --> 3385.88
makes no sense

3432.48 --> 3437.04
okay

3434.48 --> 3437.04
anyway

3450.319 --> 3454.72
who made the holograms the designer

3456.96 --> 3461.48
got the designer of this realm

3488.0 --> 3491.92
what holograms oh

3489.92 --> 3493.6800000000003
yay

3491.92 --> 3496.079
of course come late into the

3493.68 --> 3498.5589999999997
conversation after i explain things for

3496.079 --> 3500.6400000000003
like half an hour straight and then like

3498.559 --> 3504.1600000000003
oh what are you talking about oh of

3500.64 --> 3504.16
course of course do that

3515.359 --> 3520.24
yeah the holograms the celestial lights

3518.24 --> 3523.04
the sun moon

3520.24 --> 3526.0789999999997
planets stars

3523.04 --> 3526.079
falling stars

3527.359 --> 3531.5989999999997
and

3528.16 --> 3534.24
comets arguably

3531.599 --> 3537.52
holograms they're all holograms not

3534.24 --> 3539.7599999999998
actual objects in actual positions

3537.52 --> 3542.64
in relation to earth

3539.76 --> 3545.76
that reflect light or that are sources

3542.64 --> 3548.72
of light that physically shine towards

3545.76 --> 3549.92
us like lamps that's not what any of it

3548.72 --> 3553.1189999999997
is

3549.92 --> 3555.119
they're all light manifested

3553.119 --> 3560.799
they arrive

3555.119 --> 3560.799
but they don't come from something

3562.96 --> 3568.16
they just arrive at a very specific

3565.68 --> 3571.68
angular

3568.16 --> 3573.359
in angular fashion that's it

3571.68 --> 3575.52
there's no actual

3573.359 --> 3578.16
object source

3575.52 --> 3580.4
for the celestial lights

3578.16 --> 3582.72
my conclusion is they're holograms

3580.4 --> 3583.599
that's the best thing i can compare it

3582.72 --> 3586.16
to

3583.599 --> 3589.52
and since the nature of the word is

3586.16 --> 3590.48
basically the statement hologram

3589.52 --> 3592.64
light

3590.48 --> 3593.599
image

3592.64 --> 3596.319
i

3593.599 --> 3599.04
i stick to that

3596.319 --> 3602.96
i proudly call the sun moon all of the

3599.04 --> 3602.96
celestial lights holograms

3607.92 --> 3612.839
which god who gives a [ __ ] the the one

3611.839 --> 3617.2799999999997
one

3612.839 --> 3617.2799999999997
designer one designer

3617.76 --> 3622.7990000000004
that god that's the only one i ever care

3621.52 --> 3627.4
about

3622.799 --> 3627.4
the rest is all just a bunch of masks

3628.0 --> 3634.96
don't care about separated masks of god

3631.2 --> 3634.96
i only care about the real thing

3636.16 --> 3640.72
i mean i can adapt to somebody's

3640.839 --> 3648.0
personal engagement with a mask of god

3645.44 --> 3652.359
if that's how they want to do it

3648.0 --> 3652.359
but i don't do that

3658.48 --> 3664.48
no they're not projected from the hidden

3661.119 --> 3666.48
lands there is no hidden lands

3664.48 --> 3670.079
and they're not

3666.48 --> 3674.079
object made lights they're not made from

3670.079 --> 3674.079
an object in the realm

3674.559 --> 3677.119
probably

3678.079 --> 3683.52
oh my god it's just like yeah how do the

3680.88 --> 3685.52
holograms manifest oh yes let's squirt

3683.52 --> 3688.079
all day about something that's like

3685.52 --> 3689.2
really really impossible to figure out

3688.079 --> 3690.319
yes

3689.2 --> 3692.319
of course

3690.319 --> 3694.799
now that's the only thing you care about

3692.319 --> 3696.72
now the one thing you can't figure out

3694.799 --> 3699.68
of course that's the thing you need to

3696.72 --> 3702.5589999999997
know and start whining about incessantly

3699.68 --> 3703.68
of course it is the one thing you can't

3702.559 --> 3705.3590000000004
know

3703.68 --> 3707.2
that's the one thing you want to know

3705.359 --> 3710.0789999999997
now

3707.2 --> 3712.319
get a [ __ ] life

3710.079 --> 3716.1600000000003
i don't know

3712.319 --> 3720.079
you don't know nobody [ __ ] knows

3716.16 --> 3722.5589999999997
i'm just determining the nature of it

3720.079 --> 3724.799
it can get a very rough

3722.559 --> 3727.039
estimate as to like oh wow

3724.799 --> 3730.48
if i had something like that what would

3727.039 --> 3730.48
it roughly be like well

3731.599 --> 3737.2000000000003
i know it's completely natural so

3734.319 --> 3738.0
however it is manifesting it is integral

3737.2 --> 3740.5589999999997
to

3738.0 --> 3742.319
probably the shape of the realm

3740.559 --> 3745.28
the energies that are present in the

3742.319 --> 3747.119
realm i think it's a natural side effect

3745.28 --> 3749.52
literally of everything that was

3747.119 --> 3751.52
pre-designed within it

3749.52 --> 3752.64
so that would be my conclusion that

3751.52 --> 3755.44
would be

3752.64 --> 3756.4
properly godly

3755.44 --> 3758.88
like

3756.4 --> 3762.64
these lights exist

3758.88 --> 3766.88
specifically because of how everything

3762.64 --> 3766.8799999999997
is arranged that exists in the realm

3767.119 --> 3772.2400000000002
so that let's say

3769.28 --> 3774.0
something is like really wrong

3772.24 --> 3776.24
things that are practically impossible

3774.0 --> 3778.559
let's just say oh there's a

3776.24 --> 3781.839
oh there's an anti-matter bomb in the

3778.559 --> 3783.3590000000004
100 000

3781.839 --> 3785.52
gone

3783.359 --> 3788.24
a giant hole somewhere well

3785.52 --> 3790.4
if that happens it doesn't i hope i

3788.24 --> 3792.3999999999996
really hope it doesn't that would be

3790.4 --> 3795.2000000000003
preposterous if god allows something

3792.4 --> 3795.2000000000003
like that to happen

3795.28 --> 3801.44
whatever he's the designer

3798.079 --> 3803.28
but yeah then i would immediately

3801.44 --> 3805.76
get suspicious say like oh there's a

3803.28 --> 3808.48
giant hole in everything now

3805.76 --> 3810.7200000000003
look at the skies is there a giant hole

3808.48 --> 3814.4
in the skies now in the stars there's a

3810.72 --> 3817.5989999999997
whole swath a whole platter of stars

3814.4 --> 3817.599
suddenly gone missing

3818.4 --> 3823.6800000000003
well there you go now you have a lead

3820.96 --> 3826.559
only had to destroy like a giant chunk

3823.68 --> 3829.0389999999998
of the entire world for it oh look yeah

3826.559 --> 3830.7200000000003
see now we know

3829.039 --> 3833.5200000000004
the stars and the sun and the moon are

3830.72 --> 3835.7599999999998
all specifically there because of the

3833.52 --> 3837.68
way everything in the realm was arranged

3835.76 --> 3841.28
now there's a giant hole there in the

3837.68 --> 3843.52
mechanism so it's incomplete now

3841.28 --> 3843.52
yeah

3846.0 --> 3848.559
that's it

3848.64 --> 3854.319
is that really worth

3850.839 --> 3857.0389999999998
pursuing to find out like do you really

3854.319 --> 3859.599
have to destroy everything

3857.039 --> 3861.119
to be sure how it works

3859.599 --> 3862.88
you really have to do that with

3861.119 --> 3864.96
everything

3862.88 --> 3868.0
does that seem sane

3864.96 --> 3870.16
to pursue something like that

3868.0 --> 3871.039
no

3870.16 --> 3875.1189999999997
just

3871.039 --> 3878.48
give up you can't know everything you

3875.119 --> 3880.48
shouldn't know everything what the [ __ ]

3878.48 --> 3883.44
are you gonna do with it what the [ __ ]

3880.48 --> 3885.92
are other people gonna do with it

3883.44 --> 3887.92
are you gonna do something good with it

3885.92 --> 3890.079
or are you gonna make more oh look at

3887.92 --> 3892.7200000000003
the magical wizard read let's make

3890.079 --> 3894.88
everybody even more [ __ ]

3892.72 --> 3895.839
or let's blow up something to prove

3894.88 --> 3898.96
something

3895.839 --> 3900.799
oh yes of course oh yes oh all the

3898.96 --> 3902.88
knowledge about everything it's all

3900.799 --> 3905.7599999999998
yours of course we're all just gonna

3902.88 --> 3907.6800000000003
give everything to everybody

3905.76 --> 3911.44
because that's gonna do so much good

3907.68 --> 3911.44
it's not like oh yes

3912.16 --> 3916.799
let's get ready to [ __ ] everything up

3914.48 --> 3916.799
now

3916.88 --> 3922.2400000000002
yeah

3918.72 --> 3924.5589999999997
let's not do that

3922.24 --> 3927.68
yeah question everything and then when

3924.559 --> 3930.7200000000003
you find out you can't get an answer you

3927.68 --> 3931.7599999999998
shut the [ __ ] up and stop whining about

3930.72 --> 3934.5589999999997
it

3931.76 --> 3938.88
you can't have an answer

3934.559 --> 3938.88
it's not worth getting an answer

3941.68 --> 3945.9199999999996
yeah why don't you find out things that

3943.76 --> 3947.6800000000003
are a little bit closer to you

3945.92 --> 3949.2000000000003
things that actually matter think that

3947.68 --> 3951.0389999999998
you can

3949.2 --> 3953.1189999999997
do something with

3951.039 --> 3955.3590000000004
that are productive

3953.119 --> 3957.6800000000003
instead of just wanting to be the

3955.359 --> 3959.52
[ __ ] designer of the realm yourself

3957.68 --> 3962.3999999999996
like some squirty

3959.52 --> 3964.16
little wannabe god lucifer

3962.4 --> 3966.2400000000002
you want to be the god you want to be in

3964.16 --> 3967.68
control you want to be inside well [ __ ]

3966.24 --> 3971.3999999999996
you you're not

3967.68 --> 3971.3999999999996
deal with it [ __ ]

3990.799 --> 3995.839
yeah there's some things you just can't

3993.599 --> 3995.839
know

3996.24 --> 4000.0
and you shouldn't know

3998.4 --> 4002.7200000000003
because what the [ __ ] are you gonna do

4000.0 --> 4002.72
with it anyway

4004.72 --> 4008.9199999999996
what ruin more things

4028.319 --> 4033.2799999999997
are you actually on tuesday what are you

4030.64 --> 4036.839
talking about

4033.28 --> 4036.8390000000004
the best pig

4050.4 --> 4055.44
no metal sucks cockatiel when i'm on it

4053.039 --> 4058.0
does make sense it might just not make

4055.44 --> 4060.7200000000003
sense to you right now i'm just

4058.0 --> 4064.48
addressing a couple of people here that

4060.72 --> 4067.0389999999998
are just endlessly incessantly whining

4064.48 --> 4069.44
but maybe how is he created then you put

4067.039 --> 4072.559
it there how how how

4069.44 --> 4074.96
[ __ ] you why would you expect me to know

4072.559 --> 4076.799
that and even if i [ __ ] knew it why

4074.96 --> 4079.52
didn't the hell do you think i would

4076.799 --> 4083.2
just give it to a bunch of stupid-ass

4079.52 --> 4085.599
baller trolls and jack for free

4083.2 --> 4087.839
yeah if i knew it

4085.599 --> 4088.839
i'd sell it for a [ __ ] billion

4087.839 --> 4091.7599999999998
dollars

4088.839 --> 4094.72
okay i wouldn't just give it away to a

4091.76 --> 4094.7200000000003
bunch of [ __ ]

4096.319 --> 4102.2390000000005
you have to deal with it there are

4098.239 --> 4105.44
things out there you just don't know you

4102.239 --> 4108.159
will never know you will never find out

4105.44 --> 4111.2789999999995
and you will endlessly try

4108.159 --> 4113.44
and you will never find out the sooner

4111.279 --> 4116.56
you figure that out the sooner you stop

4113.44 --> 4121.5599999999995
wasting your energy and everybody's time

4116.56 --> 4121.56
about it that's what that was about

4136.48 --> 4140.639999999999
where the sun emits from it doesn't emit

4139.279 --> 4143.52
from anywhere

4140.64 --> 4147.52
you can't prove a source

4143.52 --> 4150.56
why just why didn't you start proving

4147.52 --> 4153.92
your physicality nature assumptions

4150.56 --> 4157.1990000000005
first yeah oh you want to prove it's not

4153.92 --> 4160.4
an image of light well prove it then go

4157.199 --> 4162.4
ahead can't you do it can't you approach

4160.4 --> 4165.12
the sun

4162.4 --> 4167.679
can't you get a reading

4165.12 --> 4170.719
of how literally

4167.679 --> 4173.12
you you get proof of approach by

4170.719 --> 4175.12
intensity increase all kinds of things

4173.12 --> 4177.12
that are start to linearly increase

4175.12 --> 4179.5199999999995
because you're literally approaching an

4177.12 --> 4180.5599999999995
object oh you don't get those readings

4179.52 --> 4183.359
do you

4180.56 --> 4186.799
yeah nobody does

4183.359 --> 4188.400000000001
yeah so where's your proof of a physical

4186.799 --> 4190.719
thing then

4188.4 --> 4193.3589999999995
if it's just an image of light always

4190.719 --> 4196.08
keeping its distance not changing it out

4193.359 --> 4197.679
its output not changing

4196.08 --> 4200.239
oh you think you're going it towards it

4197.679 --> 4202.32
oh oh look the amount of energy arriving

4200.239 --> 4204.239
seems to become less oh that makes so

4202.32 --> 4206.639999999999
much sense now

4204.239 --> 4208.799999999999
yes no no it doesn't

4206.64 --> 4212.159000000001
because it's not an object

4208.8 --> 4215.679
you can't prove that i can prove however

4212.159 --> 4218.48
it is visible and there's light involved

4215.679 --> 4220.56
and it definitely seems like an image

4218.48 --> 4222.0
so i have the full

4220.56 --> 4224.64
backing

4222.0 --> 4227.04
to call it a hologram and there's

4224.64 --> 4229.360000000001
nothing you can do about it you can and

4227.04 --> 4230.48
as endless questions you can ask of

4229.36 --> 4234.0
course

4230.48 --> 4236.08
yes you could do that you could say but

4234.0 --> 4238.32
the machine that we made that has a

4236.08 --> 4239.6
hologram it doesn't work that way yeah

4238.32 --> 4242.0
yeah

4239.6 --> 4244.2390000000005
just because there is a machine

4242.0 --> 4246.08
that can make a hologram does it mean

4244.239 --> 4250.239
that's a machine

4246.08 --> 4250.239
like that making a hologram

4250.8 --> 4258.0
yeah that's why when i say hologram it's

4253.44 --> 4261.839999999999
not a reference to the technology

4258.0 --> 4264.56
it's diving very deep to the core of the

4261.84 --> 4267.360000000001
very word itself

4264.56 --> 4270.159000000001
it's an image of a light that's how i

4267.36 --> 4273.799999999999
say hologram it's not a reference to a

4270.159 --> 4273.799999999999
man-made device

4282.719 --> 4287.199
what intensity of yeah oh that's cute so

4285.84 --> 4289.1990000000005
where's the proof where's your

4287.199 --> 4291.919999999999
measurements

4289.199 --> 4294.32
where's your measurements of anything

4291.92 --> 4295.4400000000005
approach the sun then get closer get a

4294.32 --> 4297.04
reading

4295.44 --> 4298.48
show

4297.04 --> 4302.48
linear

4298.48 --> 4305.44
inverse square law increase a change a

4302.48 --> 4307.44
change a change that would prove you're

4305.44 --> 4310.879999999999
actually approaching it why don't you

4307.44 --> 4312.96
bring that a proof a physical proof a

4310.88 --> 4315.36
physical reading you're getting closer

4312.96 --> 4318.159
to it angular size increase energy

4315.36 --> 4321.599999999999
increase anything increase

4318.159 --> 4323.839999999999
that would give you a slight indication

4321.6 --> 4327.6
of approaching an object why did you

4323.84 --> 4331.360000000001
bring that anything anything at all

4327.6 --> 4332.400000000001
anything anything

4331.36 --> 4334.719
yeah

4332.4 --> 4338.32
that would prove that you're approaching

4334.719 --> 4340.84
an object anything any data at all any

4338.32 --> 4343.679
reading of any

4340.84 --> 4347.360000000001
sort go get it

4343.679 --> 4351.28
until then it's a hologram not an object

4347.36 --> 4353.92
not in a physical position in the realm

4351.28 --> 4356.96
it's an image of light and there's all

4353.92 --> 4361.2390000000005
the proof in the world for that no proof

4356.96 --> 4361.2390000000005
of a physical nature though

4376.32 --> 4382.5599999999995
a bounce rater lie you're a liar tony

4380.4 --> 4385.5599999999995
you're a liar

4382.56 --> 4385.56
liar

4385.92 --> 4392.88
they don't bounce [ __ ] radar off the

4389.04 --> 4396.159
sun you [ __ ] liar

4392.88 --> 4398.64
you've not bounced radio off the sun

4396.159 --> 4401.44
nobody's bounced ready of the sun

4398.64 --> 4405.679
that's [ __ ] liars

4401.44 --> 4405.678999999999
liars you're a liar

4406.56 --> 4411.92
you haven't nobody has

4409.12 --> 4413.76
and besides aiming a [ __ ] thing out

4411.92 --> 4415.679
there from your position not changing

4413.76 --> 4417.280000000001
your position that doesn't prove

4415.679 --> 4419.92
anything

4417.28 --> 4424.08
yeah doesn't prove oh yeah it is an

4419.92 --> 4426.2390000000005
object we're approaching it it proves

4424.08 --> 4428.8
something is bouncing somehow yeah it's

4426.239 --> 4430.0
the same [ __ ] [ __ ] as the

4428.8 --> 4433.4400000000005
supposed

4430.0 --> 4435.76
radio bounce from the moon yeah

4433.44 --> 4438.08
there is no proof for that it's just

4435.76 --> 4440.2390000000005
people saying they're doing that

4438.08 --> 4443.6
lying through their back teeth like a

4440.239 --> 4445.759999999999
bunch of [ __ ] wizard scumbags

4443.6 --> 4449.76
scumbag liars

4445.76 --> 4451.6
lying disgusting scumbags

4449.76 --> 4452.88
those are the types of people that do

4451.6 --> 4456.159000000001
that that

4452.88 --> 4457.36
make me feel yeah maybe at some point in

4456.159 --> 4461.599999999999
the future

4457.36 --> 4463.36
lying should be punishable by death

4461.6 --> 4465.280000000001
yeah

4463.36 --> 4466.4
that's what those kinds of people make

4465.28 --> 4468.48
me think

4466.4 --> 4470.719
liars

4468.48 --> 4470.718999999999
yeah

4471.199 --> 4475.759999999999
now actually prove it

4473.6 --> 4478.0
i've already laid down exactly how you

4475.76 --> 4480.0
could do that with the [ __ ] radio

4478.0 --> 4482.08
bounce signal yeah

4480.0 --> 4485.04
laid it down exactly how you could do it

4482.08 --> 4488.08
nobody's ever done it i've put it down

4485.04 --> 4490.96
with fine detailed instructions exactly

4488.08 --> 4492.96
how to do it it's very doable

4490.96 --> 4494.8
with like a very limited budget you

4492.96 --> 4498.719
don't have to be a millionaire to even

4494.8 --> 4501.1990000000005
achieve that and it lay down exactly how

4498.719 --> 4503.76
you could absolutely prove

4501.199 --> 4504.96
that you could bounce a radio signal off

4503.76 --> 4507.76
a moon

4504.96 --> 4511.12
how you if that would be working how you

4507.76 --> 4513.360000000001
could prove that i've laid it down three

4511.12 --> 4515.679
years ago three

4513.36 --> 4519.199
years ago

4515.679 --> 4520.8
zero zero results zero responses it was

4519.199 --> 4522.719
seen by everybody

4520.8 --> 4526.08
ballers anti-flat earthers were

4522.719 --> 4530.4800000000005
squirting over me doing that everywhere

4526.08 --> 4534.32
zero people doing it yeah it's a lie

4530.48 --> 4537.919999999999
it's a lie you can't bounce a signal

4534.32 --> 4539.599999999999
off a moon or a sun or any of the

4537.92 --> 4542.56
luminaries

4539.6 --> 4544.4800000000005
it'll bounce off something but not the

4542.56 --> 4546.64
freaking luminaries

4544.48 --> 4550.0
you don't even vary

4546.64 --> 4552.320000000001
the direction of your signal to even see

4550.0 --> 4553.6
if it is actually bouncing off that

4552.32 --> 4555.92
thing

4553.6 --> 4557.52
or if it's just bouncing off it's just

4555.92 --> 4559.28
bouncing back

4557.52 --> 4562.0
from something

4559.28 --> 4564.159
is it from that specific

4562.0 --> 4565.52
presumed to be object

4564.159 --> 4567.28
no

4565.52 --> 4568.96
no it's not

4567.28 --> 4572.239
because if it were

4568.96 --> 4574.56
then there would be very distinct ways

4572.239 --> 4578.32
to prove that

4574.56 --> 4581.120000000001
as described in my setup in how to prove

4578.32 --> 4585.759999999999
that

4581.12 --> 4587.44
nobody's done it not a single person

4585.76 --> 4590.320000000001
because if it would be possible the

4587.44 --> 4593.28
internet would now be filled of people

4590.32 --> 4595.92
showing their examples of how that works

4593.28 --> 4599.5199999999995
and everybody would be aghast especially

4595.92 --> 4599.52
flat earth is like what the [ __ ]

4599.76 --> 4604.88
yeah it isn't though because you can't

4602.64 --> 4606.8
do that because the luminaries are not

4604.88 --> 4609.52
objects

4606.8 --> 4610.320000000001
at any distance you can bounce signals

4609.52 --> 4613.84
off

4610.32 --> 4618.159
and people that say they can are liars

4613.84 --> 4619.679
disgusting repulsive liars

4618.159 --> 4624.04
show it to me

4619.679 --> 4627.6
never say it show it to me exactly very

4624.04 --> 4630.0
manipulating the very signal source to

4627.6 --> 4631.76
prove oh it's not bouncing off the moon

4630.0 --> 4633.199
oh look it's bouncing off oh it's not

4631.76 --> 4636.96
bouncing off them it's bouncing off the

4633.199 --> 4638.719
moon live read out yeah show it to me

4636.96 --> 4641.04
it doesn't exist

4638.719 --> 4642.32
good luck good luck doing that and

4641.04 --> 4644.239
failing

4642.32 --> 4646.4
because it's not possible because the

4644.239 --> 4648.879999999999
moon is not an object to bounce a signal

4646.4 --> 4652.4
off and neither is the sun and everybody

4648.88 --> 4652.400000000001
that says so is a liar

4653.28 --> 4657.599999999999
unless they show

4656.08 --> 4658.5599999999995
demonstration

4657.6 --> 4663.400000000001
of it

4658.56 --> 4663.400000000001
the very specific requirements

4667.28 --> 4670.96
yeah yeah

4668.56 --> 4673.76
oh yeah and i'll swallow my liars liars

4670.96 --> 4676.159
liars all day long

4673.76 --> 4678.400000000001
once somebody shows me a physical

4676.159 --> 4681.28
demonstration with the extremely

4678.4 --> 4682.159
specific requirements on how to prove

4681.28 --> 4683.44
that

4682.159 --> 4686.48
yeah

4683.44 --> 4689.5199999999995
that i put down on my show three years

4686.48 --> 4692.08
ago three three years ago

4689.52 --> 4695.280000000001
lots of people seen it i've spread it

4692.08 --> 4698.08
around on other platforms too

4695.28 --> 4700.8
people know it no it exists no that

4698.08 --> 4704.239
exists yeah nobody's done it

4700.8 --> 4707.04
so everybody that says they've done that

4704.239 --> 4711.199
and they don't show it are [ __ ]

4707.04 --> 4712.08
liars and they should be beaten for that

4711.199 --> 4714.48
yeah

4712.08 --> 4714.48
beaten

4716.48 --> 4721.919999999999
