and yeah it got even wet and all that so

122.64 --> 126.88
it's kind of gray soup and dreary and

125.28 --> 128.879
rainy

126.88 --> 132.07999999999998
not hard rain but

128.879 --> 132.07999999999998
just a little here and there

133.84 --> 136.8
enough to get wet

137.12 --> 140.12
right

145.0 --> 148.08
[Applause]

150.56 --> 154.319
hello

151.44 --> 156.879

154.319 --> 158.79999999999998
pj crew shank jeff gassett good to see

156.879 --> 161.84
you

158.8 --> 164.84
it is wednesday the 29th of december

161.84 --> 164.84
2021

173.84 --> 177.04
it's my tongue

175.44 --> 179.92
under lockdown

177.04 --> 179.92
sort of yeah

181.36 --> 184.959
there's

182.319 --> 188.64
a couple of stores that seem to have

184.959 --> 190.239
like a only sale at the door policy

188.64 --> 193.11999999999998
and that's pretty much all that i'm

190.239 --> 193.12
noticing from it

194.879 --> 200.64
i i'm not fully aware of like places

198.56 --> 204.239
like restaurants are going out how that

200.64 --> 204.23899999999998
works i have no idea

204.879 --> 208.07999999999998
so

206.159 --> 212.44
because i don't really go anywhere

208.08 --> 212.44000000000003
except for just the stores

213.84 --> 216.08
right

216.239 --> 222.08
anyway how are you all doing

218.959 --> 225.36
i'm a little a little tired because it

222.08 --> 227.68
just got really really late last night

225.36 --> 228.87900000000002
i think it was like five o'clock not

227.68 --> 230.87900000000002
good

228.879 --> 235.04
but it was very restless yesterday was

230.879 --> 235.04
like a super energetic day overall

236.159 --> 240.879
it was weird

238.08 --> 244.0
it was doing pretty good on the early

240.879 --> 245.35999999999999
bird show even

244.0 --> 247.36
and

245.36 --> 251.36
yeah the flat earth debate also went

247.36 --> 251.36
very well very interesting

251.439 --> 256.56
uh

252.879 --> 258.88
oh yeah and i finally got to watch

256.56 --> 260.959
don't look up

258.88 --> 263.28
which i hadn't got to

260.959 --> 265.44
two days ago

263.28 --> 268.4
just didn't get to it but yeah i did

265.44 --> 269.6
watch it and was

268.4 --> 272.96
pretty heavy

269.6 --> 272.96000000000004
in in many ways

273.12 --> 277.6
like i feel like i need some time to

274.8 --> 277.6
digest it

280.32 --> 284.479
and

281.199 --> 284.479
also yeah it

287.6 --> 290.72
i like snow okay

292.479 --> 297.28
it seems like a lot of people are

294.96 --> 299.03999999999996
on the surface saying things about it

297.28 --> 300.4
that i'm not too sure whether that's

299.04 --> 302.40000000000003
even true

300.4 --> 306.84
like that it's supposedly about climate

302.4 --> 306.84
change i don't see that at all

313.36 --> 317.759
like it was mostly just commentary on

318.639 --> 324.40000000000003
the state of mind

321.36 --> 326.16
of society i i don't know why but i'm

324.4 --> 328.96
suddenly getting all this tension again

326.16 --> 330.40000000000003
i don't want that

328.96 --> 332.71999999999997
i was worried about that what's gonna

330.4 --> 332.71999999999997
happen

334.88 --> 340.069
it's because yeah

336.91 --> 340.069
[Music]

342.85 --> 349.32000000000005
[Music]

346.32 --> 349.32
ah

354.16 --> 359.03900000000004
right and then

356.72 --> 361.44000000000005
after that i kind of

359.039 --> 365.96
i watched men in black again after that

361.44 --> 365.96
just to kind of get my mind off it

366.319 --> 370.47900000000004
uh

368.639 --> 373.68
yeah and that caught me

370.479 --> 373.68
up very late so

374.639 --> 378.96000000000004
but yeah it was very

376.8 --> 383.36
energetic but restless day

378.96 --> 383.35999999999996
and that capped on in into the night

385.36 --> 390.52000000000004
yes i watched the whole thing through

387.12 --> 390.52
chosen one

404.8 --> 407.8
uh

409.199 --> 412.96000000000004
watch matrix4 no i haven't seen that one

411.68 --> 414.8
yet

412.96 --> 416.63899999999995
i am gonna watch it somewhere but i'm

414.8 --> 419.8
not hearing all that great things about

416.639 --> 419.8
it so

423.599 --> 428.15999999999997
yeah no math but it's all math yeah yeah

425.919 --> 431.52
no it was

428.16 --> 436.199
it was very rich in details and rich in

431.52 --> 436.19899999999996
kind of like subterfuge narratives

436.8 --> 441.599
so there was in general a lot of

438.96 --> 444.15999999999997
commentary that was basically being

441.599 --> 447.96
addressed in that movie

444.16 --> 447.96000000000004
and a lot of it covertly

450.479 --> 455.24
pretty thickly multi-layered movie

474.56 --> 480.24
yeah yeah chosen one yeah i don't have

476.56 --> 480.24
to spoil it all

480.8 --> 486.12
well probably most people have already

482.8 --> 486.12
seen it

492.16 --> 496.24
a lot of people don't like it

494.16 --> 498.0
all right pj kershank well that gives me

496.24 --> 500.72
some hope that it might be somewhat

498.0 --> 500.72
redeemable

501.28 --> 504.479
we'll see

502.319 --> 508.56
but i'm not gonna watch it anytime soon

504.479 --> 508.56
i need some time to just take it easy

520.88 --> 523.88
do

535.92 --> 540.04
all right i'll be right back

684.0 --> 687.0
yo

694.88 --> 699.519
you watched it twice the matrix four

697.2 --> 699.519
okay

700.16 --> 704.56
the buzzing show yeah sorry it's still

702.32 --> 704.5600000000001
there

711.279 --> 716.399
all right i did try to put some like

713.44 --> 718.639
toilet paper in between

716.399 --> 720.32
my desk and the microphone but it seems

718.639 --> 721.79
like it doesn't really it's not really

720.32 --> 724.9100000000001
enough

721.79 --> 724.91
[Music]

726.079 --> 731.12
let's see is that doing anything

730.32 --> 732.72
okay

731.12 --> 733.68
a little

732.72 --> 735.9200000000001
right

733.68 --> 737.68
uh yeah sorry george sanford i

735.92 --> 740.56
appreciate it for now you'd stop

737.68 --> 740.56
complaining about it

742.88 --> 746.639
put a sock over

744.399 --> 749.88
hmm

746.639 --> 749.88
that's hilarious

782.0 --> 786.68
sounds better all right all right cool

822.88 --> 826.56
right if i'm gonna have another night

824.56 --> 828.6389999999999
like this

826.56 --> 830.16
like i don't want to even do the shows

828.639 --> 831.92
anymore

830.16 --> 833.519
if i'm gonna keep feeling like this

831.92 --> 835.76
because it's just it doesn't work

833.519 --> 838.639
yesterday i didn't have it at all today

835.76 --> 838.639
again it's like

839.12 --> 843.0
it's annoying tension

849.92 --> 854.639
i don't know what it is man

852.079 --> 857.8389999999999
i really hope it kind of stops at the

854.639 --> 857.839
new year

871.92 --> 875.3199999999999
hello free-minded

901.199 --> 904.199
uh

930.72 --> 936.36
hey seeking star wars g good to see you

944.399 --> 950.72
maybe just the stress of this yeah pgp i

947.92 --> 954.8389999999999
really hope so man because it's

950.72 --> 954.839
it's wearing on me dude

964.88 --> 971.36
and there's like things that information

967.279 --> 971.36
wise i've just picked up on and

975.92 --> 980.519
for some reason it's like too heavy

986.0 --> 989.0
yes

1005.04 --> 1011.199
and it's like also like

1007.519 --> 1013.839
i'm fractal thinking reflecting a lot on

1011.199 --> 1016.959
pretty much everything i've been doing

1013.839 --> 1020.32
like the last half year

1016.959 --> 1023.199
but then i can't handle it

1020.32 --> 1025.839
it's like i can't even handle what i'm

1023.199 --> 1025.839
doing

1027.36 --> 1033.6
even though i still believe it is

1030.64 --> 1033.6000000000001
what i need to do

1035.039 --> 1039.079
it just gets kind of punishing

1054.0 --> 1057.919
if i watch any of the lost history of

1055.919 --> 1061.039
earth yeah i watched the two-parter

1057.919 --> 1063.919
video yes i did see star wars

1061.039 --> 1063.919
some time ago

1065.6 --> 1069.039
it was very interesting

1075.28 --> 1081.039
like a lot of mechanical effects were

1078.48 --> 1084.559
just displayed

1081.039 --> 1087.6
in a very clear way so it was a very

1084.559 --> 1091.0
clarifying video i thought lost history

1087.6 --> 1091.0
of flat earth

1095.6 --> 1098.6
um

1110.32 --> 1113.32
um

1136.32 --> 1140.0
is it a youtube yeah pg cruise shank i

1138.48 --> 1143.2
posted it

1140.0 --> 1146.24
some time ago here in in the chat

1143.2 --> 1146.24
i could dig it up

1148.88 --> 1151.8400000000001
uh

1170.08 --> 1172.559
that's it

1177.2 --> 1180.88
i think my mouse is getting old

1188.32 --> 1191.36
this is

1189.919 --> 1193.8400000000001
it seeking

1191.36 --> 1193.84
yeah the video

1196.88 --> 1202.0800000000002
oh

1198.16 --> 1207.159
oh it seems like you beat me to it

1202.08 --> 1207.1589999999999
oh you're using another link anyway

1223.039 --> 1226.72
detoxing with borax

1232.24 --> 1235.84
well i i don't know

1240.4 --> 1242.5590000000002
like

1244.159 --> 1247.44
ask and receive like it's

1247.6 --> 1251.9189999999999
it feels like it's a natural process

1252.799 --> 1256.8799999999999
and yeah

1254.48 --> 1258.0
it's probably doing something to my

1256.88 --> 1259.919
system

1258.0 --> 1263.36
other than kind of screw up the

1259.919 --> 1267.6000000000001
situation in what i want at the moment

1263.36 --> 1267.6
it's doing something right look

1269.12 --> 1271.9189999999999
i'm an empath

1271.039 --> 1275.28
i'm

1271.919 --> 1276.64
like really really sensitive

1275.28 --> 1280.32
except

1276.64 --> 1283.039
unlike really sensitive empaths i'm not

1280.32 --> 1285.6789999999999
completely hysterical most of the time

1283.039 --> 1288.0
and just like trying to shield myself

1285.679 --> 1288.96
from sensories

1288.0 --> 1290.4
but

1288.96 --> 1293.2
because of that

1290.4 --> 1294.72
every time something

1293.2 --> 1297.679
happens

1294.72 --> 1300.4
that is like significant in a spiritual

1297.679 --> 1301.919
way of some kind

1300.4 --> 1304.64
like it makes

1301.919 --> 1306.72
massive impact on me

1304.64 --> 1308.24
and not even like in the moment it's not

1306.72 --> 1311.919
like oh i first hear about it and then

1308.24 --> 1315.679
like oh my god i'm so crushed no

1311.919 --> 1319.2
not like that at all actually

1315.679 --> 1321.6000000000001
it's more that i'm just like

1319.2 --> 1324.559
i'm just taking it

1321.6 --> 1328.08
militant wise

1324.559 --> 1330.0
but then afterward it that's the sinking

1328.08 --> 1332.24
in period and that's where all the

1330.0 --> 1334.24
punishment comes in and i think it's

1332.24 --> 1337.28
part of the reason why i'm feeling so

1334.24 --> 1337.28
sick because just

1338.4 --> 1343.1200000000001
exposed to so many different things that

1340.72 --> 1343.1200000000001
are so

1343.36 --> 1350.799
over stressed and maddening and like

1348.24 --> 1350.799
scary

1351.12 --> 1355.6
to feel where some people have just

1354.08 --> 1359.12
ended up with

1355.6 --> 1359.12
spiritually it's scary

1359.36 --> 1364.799
and there's been a lot of it

1362.24 --> 1364.799
it's like

1366.4 --> 1370.72
darkness is darker than i thought

1372.0 --> 1375.4
kind of effect

1387.919 --> 1390.919
uh

1404.0 --> 1407.44
what

1404.96 --> 1409.2
voted best daily to our flat earth

1407.44 --> 1412.88
morning show in the netherlands what are

1409.2 --> 1412.88
you talking about that flat fellow

1413.76 --> 1416.76
really

1419.679 --> 1426.3200000000002
or am i simply the only

1423.039 --> 1426.32
flat earth morning show

1427.279 --> 1433.6
but i think that i thank the

1430.96 --> 1433.6000000000001
the notion

1443.36 --> 1449.8799999999999
you can bathe or shower with it okay

1445.52 --> 1449.8799999999999
that's really weird ass can receive

1474.159 --> 1478.919
i hope you're right seeking star wars

1493.279 --> 1496.279
ugh

1500.159 --> 1503.1200000000001
i mean it should

1512.799 --> 1516.6399999999999
i did a daily poll at my house

1514.89 --> 1521.0
[Laughter]

1516.64 --> 1521.0
thank you that platfor that's hilarious

1528.24 --> 1535.52
you cry daily okay well i don't really

1533.039 --> 1537.919
like i have to be like at a real

1535.52 --> 1540.8799999999999
breaking point to get there and not even

1537.919 --> 1543.8400000000001
like it's just that

1540.88 --> 1543.8400000000001
what you said

1551.12 --> 1554.6
jesus went

1560.0 --> 1562.24
hey

1567.6 --> 1573.52
my roommate just got home

1570.96 --> 1573.52
that's nice

1582.559 --> 1586.799
the ways of humanity is mindful yeah

1584.559 --> 1586.799
well

1595.52 --> 1602.32
but i'm trying to like not i'm trying to

1598.159 --> 1602.3200000000002
unboggle my mind at the moment

1609.919 --> 1615.2
i'm kind of just trying to see contact

1612.08 --> 1615.1999999999998
with god and not

1616.48 --> 1621.279
like this

1617.52 --> 1621.279
spiritual tactic where i

1621.52 --> 1624.48
tap into

1622.96 --> 1627.039
what's wrong

1624.48 --> 1629.76
and then try to use my own energy to

1627.039 --> 1629.76
kind of like

1630.32 --> 1636.3999999999999
help maneuver it

1632.559 --> 1636.3999999999999
but it it rubs off on you

1636.559 --> 1639.44
when you do that

1639.52 --> 1644.559
and

1641.279 --> 1647.84
yeah i'm not handling it well right now

1644.559 --> 1651.2
so i'm kind of just trying to avoid

1647.84 --> 1652.8799999999999
thinking about those large skill issues

1651.2 --> 1655.279
too much

1652.88 --> 1658.0
and just focus more on like the pure

1655.279 --> 1658.0
little things

1659.76 --> 1664.279
so i can just calm down

1668.399 --> 1671.36
so can a bear

1672.559 --> 1678.08
right yeah the borax thing i don't know

1676.96 --> 1679.52
have to

1678.08 --> 1682.1589999999999
talk about that

1679.52 --> 1684.48
with my dad

1682.159 --> 1687.279
because i think this is just a actually

1684.48 --> 1689.52
a normal part of the cycle

1687.279 --> 1691.76
which is quite a punishing realization

1689.52 --> 1694.32
on its own it's like yeah are we yeah oh

1691.76 --> 1697.84
you want that power well guess what this

1694.32 --> 1697.84
is part of the price

1701.12 --> 1706.1589999999999
yeah getting really sick from stress

1709.52 --> 1714.559
and i'm not like this

1711.919 --> 1716.88
raging bull type figure that can like

1714.559 --> 1718.72
literally just take on anything and that

1716.88 --> 1721.6000000000001
at worst

1718.72 --> 1723.52
might just bash things aside a little

1721.6 --> 1726.6399999999999
recklessly

1723.52 --> 1731.52
right i'm not that type of type so i'm

1726.64 --> 1731.5200000000002
actually i am taking the full impact

1733.6 --> 1737.0
do i meditate

1740.08 --> 1742.32
no

1743.039 --> 1746.72
like

1744.48 --> 1748.559
meditation only really works for me when

1746.72 --> 1751.039
i feel very strong and i'm just getting

1748.559 --> 1753.039
distracted or something

1751.039 --> 1755.279
when i feel like this it's more like i

1753.039 --> 1758.1589999999999
need

1755.279 --> 1758.159
to somehow

1759.279 --> 1764.32
stop the energy from

1761.6 --> 1765.52
gathering and get it staying stuck in a

1764.32 --> 1768.559
place

1765.52 --> 1771.76
over stressing like organs

1768.559 --> 1773.52
and like things like walking right

1771.76 --> 1776.08
taking a walk in a forest getting some

1773.52 --> 1778.1589999999999
fresh air and just

1776.08 --> 1780.6399999999999
being distracted by your

1778.159 --> 1783.44
visual senses with nature and just

1780.64 --> 1786.48
thinking about that for a moment then

1783.44 --> 1788.48
trying to prevent even getting dramatic

1786.48 --> 1793.159
with existential thinking about that

1788.48 --> 1793.159
because the problem is guys i

1797.12 --> 1802.76
i have problems deactivating the fractal

1799.76 --> 1802.76
thinking

1806.23 --> 1809.329
[Music]

1812.96 --> 1815.919
it's and it's that been part of the

1814.88 --> 1817.279
problem

1815.919 --> 1820.3990000000001
right

1817.279 --> 1824.24
i can't just say no i'm not gonna

1820.399 --> 1824.2399999999998
think beyond this line here

1826.24 --> 1828.48
it's

1829.76 --> 1835.039
it's like

1831.039 --> 1837.76
my mind is just like no

1835.039 --> 1840.0
we're at war

1837.76 --> 1844.12
we don't have time to stop

1840.0 --> 1844.12
even though it is kind of irrational

1855.279 --> 1859.48
i want it back under control

1868.72 --> 1875.559
i need to just be me

1871.84 --> 1875.559
and not everything

1887.2 --> 1890.159
and

1888.559 --> 1892.24
i don't know why the [ __ ] i'm so

1890.159 --> 1894.88
freaking emotional about this this is

1892.24 --> 1898.32
ridiculous

1894.88 --> 1900.96
but it was also the movie

1898.32 --> 1902.0
don't look up

1900.96 --> 1904.32
like

1902.0 --> 1907.84
in ways

1904.32 --> 1907.84
it got to me

1908.72 --> 1916.0
because

1911.12 --> 1916.0
like the actors they really put so much

1916.48 --> 1922.24
real effort into it

1918.799 --> 1924.1589999999999
and the way it like ended

1922.24 --> 1926.0
that really got to me

1924.159 --> 1928.88
even though i know it's fiction and

1926.0 --> 1932.0
nothing like that could ever happen

1928.88 --> 1935.1200000000001
but it was more like a

1932.0 --> 1937.84
a metaphor of like a spiritual struggle

1935.12 --> 1937.84
that was gonna

1938.0 --> 1941.6
it's almost like the entire movie is

1940.32 --> 1943.76
like

1941.6 --> 1946.1589999999999
it's actually a metaphor for the

1943.76 --> 1947.36
psychological struggle of the entire

1946.159 --> 1950.159
world

1947.36 --> 1952.4799999999998
and like the the delusional pathways

1950.159 --> 1955.7600000000002
that we've gone down for strategical

1952.48 --> 1958.08
advantage that we can't get out of

1955.76 --> 1961.039
and talking about everybody

1958.08 --> 1961.039
in their own way

1961.279 --> 1965.919
and it's almost like it was a symbol for

1963.679 --> 1965.919
that

1966.159 --> 1973.96
like we are gonna destroy ourselves

1970.399 --> 1977.84
with this fanatical

1973.96 --> 1977.8400000000001
compartmentalized ignorance

1978.159 --> 1982.7990000000002
we're gonna destroy ourselves and each

1980.48 --> 1982.799
other

1984.72 --> 1988.6000000000001
i think that was it

1990.72 --> 1996.679
and it's not something i expected to

1992.96 --> 1996.679
find in that movie

2014.48 --> 2019.44
you see the movie despite that it had

2017.279 --> 2020.96
like kind of funny moments and clever

2019.44 --> 2024.96
commentary

2020.96 --> 2024.96
it was really cynical

2025.76 --> 2031.72
like

2027.519 --> 2031.72
it was actually depressing

2032.72 --> 2038.159
ever it was kind of making fun of people

2035.519 --> 2040.799
not being able to handle the truth on

2038.159 --> 2043.44
every scale

2040.799 --> 2046.08
and yeah you can think like hahaha but

2043.44 --> 2050.12
that's from a position

2046.08 --> 2050.12
of absolute devastation

2064.24 --> 2069.6789999999996
oh my god

2066.32 --> 2071.52
i think that might have been it

2069.679 --> 2074.679
that's the thing that was burdening me

2071.52 --> 2074.679
so much

2094.399 --> 2097.96
that's weird

2104.24 --> 2109.2
okay i'll just recompose myself i got it

2106.96 --> 2109.2
out

2110.96 --> 2116.0
i thought i was gonna like

2113.2 --> 2118.3999999999996
feel enthusiastic about oh it's so smart

2116.0 --> 2118.4
here and there

2123.119 --> 2127.52
well

2125.359 --> 2130.52
the deeper message was just really

2127.52 --> 2130.52
worrisome

2131.76 --> 2134.7200000000003
and true

2140.64 --> 2147.56
laurie is about to grow wings and fly to

2143.119 --> 2147.56
the nettles of you that's really sweet

2164.4 --> 2167.4
uh

2184.079 --> 2187.8390000000004
hey what working bunny bear

2190.96 --> 2195.92
yeah guys i do kind of need a hug that's

2193.359 --> 2195.92
very sweet

2198.48 --> 2206.079
it's just this is not like fear right

2202.48 --> 2206.079
you do recognize it it's not

2207.44 --> 2213.56
fear like oh they're gonna get me or no

2210.24 --> 2213.56
this is

2214.16 --> 2219.7599999999998
i fear for people

2216.96 --> 2219.76
i fear that

2222.4 --> 2228.04
they don't realize what this is all

2224.24 --> 2228.04
gonna do to everybody

2235.2 --> 2240.3999999999996
like even figuring out how things are

2237.92 --> 2241.52
fake and and managing to find a way

2240.4 --> 2243.92
through

2241.52 --> 2246.0
without letting it touch you

2243.92 --> 2247.599
well guess what you might be finding a

2246.0 --> 2249.52
way through you might have your own

2247.599 --> 2251.839
space where you can still do things the

2249.52 --> 2254.8
way they should be done

2251.839 --> 2254.7999999999997
but out there

2254.88 --> 2260.079
there's people that aren't

2258.16 --> 2263.2799999999997
and it's wearing on them

2260.079 --> 2265.44
and they are conduits too just like we

2263.28 --> 2268.6400000000003
all are

2265.44 --> 2271.28
and they are channeling

2268.64 --> 2273.359
through their delusion all kinds of

2271.28 --> 2277.0400000000004
things into the world

2273.359 --> 2279.2
that we really don't need

2277.04 --> 2280.96
that are going to be

2279.2 --> 2283.52
devastating

2280.96 --> 2285.839
to the collective psyche right we're

2283.52 --> 2285.839
yeah

2288.4 --> 2293.44
we're not talking about flat earth right

2291.04 --> 2295.04
at this point flat earth

2293.44 --> 2296.4
and the globe

2295.04 --> 2299.2799999999997
is like

2296.4 --> 2301.2000000000003
a side note

2299.28 --> 2302.2400000000002
that's funny that i'm saying that like

2301.2 --> 2304.16
that but

2302.24 --> 2307.839
i mean it's still very important and

2304.16 --> 2311.44
mechanical but it is more like a

2307.839 --> 2312.96
a technical side note

2311.44 --> 2314.16
because there's plenty of people out

2312.96 --> 2316.16
there that are

2314.16 --> 2317.7599999999998
that are like that they're like oh

2316.16 --> 2319.359
oh they're lying about that well not

2317.76 --> 2320.96
surprising

2319.359 --> 2325.44
don't know if it's like flat though and

2320.96 --> 2327.68
you seem to know very little right so

2325.44 --> 2330.16
i'm just gonna leave it like that i'm

2327.68 --> 2332.48
gonna focus on my own thing

2330.16 --> 2335.2
that's what a lot of people do right so

2332.48 --> 2337.68
it is almost now i mean

2335.2 --> 2340.0789999999997
it's broken through

2337.68 --> 2343.5989999999997
we've had our influence we have our

2340.079 --> 2343.599
entanglements but

2345.28 --> 2349.28
it's technically compared to everything

2347.599 --> 2354.2400000000002
that's happening right now the

2349.28 --> 2358.5600000000004
psychological warfare it is a side note

2354.24 --> 2358.56
i mean just because the programming

2358.8 --> 2363.76
that we are all being subjected to right

2361.04 --> 2366.0
now through media and governments just

2363.76 --> 2367.2000000000003
because it's kind of simple to figure

2366.0 --> 2369.839
out

2367.2 --> 2370.7999999999997
it mean that it doesn't have

2369.839 --> 2374.16
very

2370.8 --> 2376.1600000000003
heavy detrimental influences on the

2374.16 --> 2378.96
collective psyche

2376.16 --> 2382.48
and on what people will intuitively be

2378.96 --> 2385.28
able to grab hold off

2382.48 --> 2388.4
right they're rearranging

2385.28 --> 2390.0
the societal collective intuitive ladder

2388.4 --> 2392.2400000000002
by doing this

2390.0 --> 2394.64
it's like they're chipping away at the

2392.24 --> 2395.839
standard intuitive

2394.64 --> 2399.1189999999997
ladder

2395.839 --> 2402.16
that everybody uses everybody that's the

2399.119 --> 2403.359
way we interface collectively

2402.16 --> 2405.04
and they're

2403.359 --> 2407.119
chipping away at it

2405.04 --> 2410.079
we don't even know what the damage of

2407.119 --> 2412.1600000000003
that's gonna be i don't even know and i

2410.079 --> 2414.0
can

2412.16 --> 2416.16
just

2414.0 --> 2421.24
yeah just i'm only

2416.16 --> 2421.24
barely proficient in describing it

2425.76 --> 2429.6800000000003
thank you professor phil

2428.24 --> 2432.0
that you're right

2429.68 --> 2435.2
that's that's very wise advice i

2432.0 --> 2437.68
actually said that before it's just that

2435.2 --> 2440.8799999999997
i can't stop it

2437.68 --> 2443.2799999999997
i can't turn it off

2440.88 --> 2446.079
like i really can i try to

2443.28 --> 2451.079
but as soon as my thinking is activated

2446.079 --> 2451.079
immediately i just it's like

2452.96 --> 2455.92
it just happens

2458.56 --> 2463.2799999999997
it's crazy

2461.44 --> 2464.56
i can't stop it

2463.28 --> 2467.28
right now

2464.56 --> 2469.52
that maybe that's again the ancestral

2467.28 --> 2471.76
winds right what i'm talking about now

2469.52 --> 2474.16
even like the emotions that come through

2471.76 --> 2475.44
that is what's been kind of punishing me

2474.16 --> 2478.0
that's

2475.44 --> 2479.359
why i feel sick

2478.0 --> 2481.68
sometimes it's

2479.359 --> 2485.119
loaded with emotion

2481.68 --> 2488.7999999999997
sometimes it's loaded with just pure

2485.119 --> 2491.119
like savage wrath

2488.8 --> 2494.1600000000003
because of like

2491.119 --> 2498.88
like who's done this

2494.16 --> 2498.8799999999997
who's allowed this to become like this

2501.44 --> 2504.96
and i'm not talking about the people

2503.2 --> 2506.7999999999997
that don't have a grip and that are just

2504.96 --> 2509.119
saying like okay i'll just go along with

2506.8 --> 2511.599
it whatever i don't understand it but

2509.119 --> 2514.2400000000002
who's the one that actually

2511.599 --> 2514.2400000000002
done this

2514.319 --> 2519.359
and i feel considerable amounts of wrath

2517.28 --> 2521.2000000000003
towards those individuals and i don't

2519.359 --> 2524.56
even know who they are

2521.2 --> 2526.56
i don't even know their faces

2524.56 --> 2528.7999999999997
some

2526.56 --> 2531.2
some i do

2528.8 --> 2532.7200000000003
and then the mystery deepens even more

2531.2 --> 2536.319
to me

2532.72 --> 2539.2
because in a way they are

2536.319 --> 2542.8
disconnected

2539.2 --> 2542.7999999999997
it's very bizarre

2543.44 --> 2549.04
like my experience like i've experienced

2546.24 --> 2552.0
people from the shadow side that never

2549.04 --> 2554.24
step into the light like that

2552.0 --> 2555.599
like they seem kind of insignificant

2554.24 --> 2557.7599999999998
people

2555.599 --> 2560.6400000000003
whenever they even hit the light so you

2557.76 --> 2563.6400000000003
don't even recognize them as what they

2560.64 --> 2563.64
are

2564.16 --> 2567.2
and what they really do

2567.44 --> 2571.119
tell just a double-edged sword yeah no

2569.2 --> 2573.5989999999997
[ __ ] professor field bill

2571.119 --> 2573.599
it is

2574.96 --> 2578.16
bigger

2576.4 --> 2580.7200000000003
your intelligence

2578.16 --> 2581.68
the bigger the punishment

2580.72 --> 2584.319
and

2581.68 --> 2584.319
the bigger

2584.4 --> 2589.44
usually eventually to balance it out

2587.44 --> 2590.839
the ego

2589.44 --> 2593.52
because there is

2590.839 --> 2595.359
no brilliance

2593.52 --> 2598.8
without ego

2595.359 --> 2601.119
to to balance it out

2598.8 --> 2603.6800000000003
right doesn't necessarily have that the

2601.119 --> 2606.079
ego has the root to ruin the brilliance

2603.68 --> 2608.3999999999996
but usually when brilliance truly

2606.079 --> 2612.4
manifests

2608.4 --> 2615.04
is like recognized and then it

2612.4 --> 2617.04
it shows the other side like that

2615.04 --> 2618.64
brilliance energy it has to come from

2617.04 --> 2620.48
somewhere

2618.64 --> 2622.56
it has an influence

2620.48 --> 2624.2400000000002
through your consciousness and the ego

2622.56 --> 2627.839
will

2624.24 --> 2627.839
get its share

2628.079 --> 2633.6800000000003
it's like a dog

2629.92 --> 2636.16
that brings you amazing prizes

2633.68 --> 2638.24
you have to give it a treat

2636.16 --> 2640.16
and it will get used to the treats it

2638.24 --> 2641.52
will want more treats

2640.16 --> 2645.1189999999997
right

2641.52 --> 2645.119
it's complicated

2646.319 --> 2652.16
ego and intelligence is complicated

2649.76 --> 2656.3190000000004
and if you're not super intelligent then

2652.16 --> 2656.319
the ego is actually quite easy

2656.48 --> 2660.8
i mean it will be more complicated to

2658.64 --> 2662.7999999999997
you because you're not intelligent but

2660.8 --> 2665.6800000000003
your ego

2662.8 --> 2668.1600000000003
will not will be much more

2665.68 --> 2669.839
easy to deal with

2668.16 --> 2673.1189999999997
and more easily

2669.839 --> 2674.24
basically take a knee to another ego

2673.119 --> 2679.88
for

2674.24 --> 2679.8799999999997
just like yeah social honor and all that

2690.16 --> 2693.68
right it's like the more intelligent you

2692.4 --> 2696.079
are

2693.68 --> 2698.7999999999997
the tougher it becomes to even have

2696.079 --> 2698.8
humility

2699.92 --> 2702.4
it is

2702.72 --> 2707.9199999999996
but it will form a trap because if you

2704.64 --> 2710.0
don't then you will make mistakes

2707.92 --> 2711.92
and then eventually you will stumble

2710.0 --> 2713.2
anyway which is what you were trying to

2711.92 --> 2715.359
prevent

2713.2 --> 2717.1189999999997
because no matter how intelligent you

2715.359 --> 2719.359
are you cannot

2717.119 --> 2721.76
prevent making mistakes

2719.359 --> 2723.5989999999997
due to a lack of oversight

2721.76 --> 2725.599
because with all the intelligence in the

2723.599 --> 2727.119
world you're always going to end up

2725.599 --> 2728.7200000000003
focusing

2727.119 --> 2730.88
within a certain

2728.72 --> 2732.8799999999997
range within a certain spectrum of the

2730.88 --> 2734.4
whole thing and where your specialty is

2732.88 --> 2737.28
where your

2734.4 --> 2740.079
where your details come yeah

2737.28 --> 2742.3190000000004
come to light and really help

2740.079 --> 2747.6400000000003
but that means that other things you do

2742.319 --> 2747.64
not oversee as well it always happens

2756.0 --> 2761.04
clench both fists and lead it's your job

2758.8 --> 2765.88
wow professor phil bell i

2761.04 --> 2765.88
i am honored that you'd see me like that

2782.56 --> 2787.52
fear of not knowing

2784.96 --> 2790.96
have you ever considered

2787.52 --> 2790.96
the fear of knowing

2794.56 --> 2799.44
like i don't even understand the fear of

2796.72 --> 2799.4399999999996
not knowing

2800.24 --> 2804.4799999999996
there's nothing more comfortable than

2802.24 --> 2806.7999999999997
truly not knowing something

2804.48 --> 2808.72
because then it's not gonna nag you then

2806.8 --> 2810.8
there's nothing you really have to do

2808.72 --> 2812.9599999999996
right this is part of the psychological

2810.8 --> 2815.52
trick

2812.96 --> 2817.52
that's pulled a lot of people through

2815.52 --> 2820.48
through the psychological warfare but

2817.52 --> 2823.2
it's going to run into a dead end

2820.48 --> 2823.2
eventually

2824.88 --> 2831.7200000000003
because

2827.04 --> 2831.72
there's things that you just must know

2832.48 --> 2838.16
because you must let it

2834.72 --> 2839.5989999999997
change the way you view things

2838.16 --> 2841.92
in order to

2839.599 --> 2842.88
well to prevent running into that dead

2841.92 --> 2845.839
end

2842.88 --> 2845.839
you have to wake up

2846.96 --> 2849.839
or you will be

2848.64 --> 2852.24
corralled

2849.839 --> 2854.48
into a pen that will lead to the

2852.24 --> 2856.0
entrance of a slaughterhouse

2854.48 --> 2857.359
that's

2856.0 --> 2861.28
pretty much

2857.359 --> 2861.2799999999997
dead on an analogy for it

2862.16 --> 2866.0
right

2863.28 --> 2869.76
but for me i do not have fear of not

2866.0 --> 2869.76
knowing i have fear of knowing

2870.24 --> 2874.24
fear of the things that i already know

2872.8 --> 2875.6800000000003
should be there

2874.24 --> 2877.52
and that i wish

2875.68 --> 2880.72
that i would never

2877.52 --> 2882.88
actually experience the details of

2880.72 --> 2885.5989999999997
up closer

2882.88 --> 2886.7200000000003
right this is for example why i really

2885.599 --> 2888.079
really

2886.72 --> 2891.1189999999997
really

2888.079 --> 2893.3590000000004
don't like to talk about like

2891.119 --> 2894.48
torture and [ __ ]

2893.359 --> 2896.0
or

2894.48 --> 2897.359
pedo stuff

2896.0 --> 2901.72
it's cause

2897.359 --> 2901.72
i really don't wanna know

2910.16 --> 2913.359
but i know it's there

2913.76 --> 2919.92
and being [ __ ] with within our minds

2917.559 --> 2922.3190000000004
overexposed right

2919.92 --> 2924.8
we get bombarded with it

2922.319 --> 2927.2799999999997
when there's probably very little of it

2924.8 --> 2930.319
and we get deprived from it when it's

2927.28 --> 2933.0400000000004
probably really there

2930.319 --> 2937.52
so we can actually stay

2933.04 --> 2937.52
comfortably ignorant of it in the moment

2938.96 --> 2943.92
this is how i see it it's like

2941.2 --> 2947.2
everything whether it even realizes or

2943.92 --> 2947.2000000000003
not is lying

2948.4 --> 2952.319
like

2949.68 --> 2954.24
through narrative

2952.319 --> 2955.359
every time there's torture porn or

2954.24 --> 2958.72
something

2955.359 --> 2961.68
it's usually super exaggerated

2958.72 --> 2962.7999999999997
because it it doesn't actually apply to

2961.68 --> 2964.319
everything

2962.8 --> 2965.92
about the individual that's being

2964.319 --> 2970.88
highlighted

2965.92 --> 2972.48
although they it might have at points

2970.88 --> 2975.119
and then others

2972.48 --> 2977.119
you never know about it you literally

2975.119 --> 2980.319
will never know it

2977.119 --> 2982.4
and you might even be like colleagues

2980.319 --> 2984.24
you'll never know it

2982.4 --> 2985.76
you'll feel something is kind of weird

2984.24 --> 2988.64
about him

2985.76 --> 2991.2000000000003
but you'll never get the hint of that

2988.64 --> 2993.52
sensation from what they're actually

2991.2 --> 2993.52
doing

2994.319 --> 2999.839
that's like by the way true psychopathy

2997.52 --> 2999.839
so

3000.64 --> 3003.2799999999997
like

3002.0 --> 3005.92
bread

3003.28 --> 3007.3590000000004
psychopathy not just who was born that

3005.92 --> 3011.28
way you learned how to deal with it no

3007.359 --> 3013.68
no actually systematically bred

3011.28 --> 3015.599
and trained

3013.68 --> 3019.5989999999997
psychopaths

3015.599 --> 3019.599
through flam family bloodlines

3021.76 --> 3024.8
and

3022.72 --> 3028.5589999999997
nobody can truly understand the

3024.8 --> 3030.6400000000003
implications of their existence among us

3028.559 --> 3033.0400000000004
unless you're one of them

3030.64 --> 3035.52
then you know

3033.04 --> 3039.4
what it means

3035.52 --> 3039.4
but only they do

3040.48 --> 3044.0
they know things that no

3042.64 --> 3046.72
no person

3044.0 --> 3049.28
that isn't a natural born psychopath can

3046.72 --> 3049.2799999999997
understand

3050.72 --> 3054.72
and

3052.559 --> 3057.76
actual human beings

3054.72 --> 3060.0
that are not psychopaths born

3057.76 --> 3063.119
they know things that a psychopath can

3060.0 --> 3063.119
never understand

3063.839 --> 3069.359
and that's why they think it's ugly

3066.88 --> 3071.2000000000003
because they can never appreciate the

3069.359 --> 3072.48
true beauty

3071.2 --> 3074.5589999999997
of

3072.48 --> 3076.88
like suffering

3074.559 --> 3078.079
for a good cause

3076.88 --> 3080.48
they can't

3078.079 --> 3083.8390000000004
fathom this you understand they cannot

3080.48 --> 3083.839
fathom that

3095.76 --> 3098.0
right

3109.44 --> 3113.52
oh okay professor phil bell why don't

3111.359 --> 3113.52
you

3118.64 --> 3123.2799999999997
you're putting on some really big scoops

3120.72 --> 3125.359
there i appreciate it still though i

3123.28 --> 3127.119
take it kind of that serious it's kind

3125.359 --> 3129.2
of weird though to hear it from somebody

3127.119 --> 3130.319
else

3129.2 --> 3132.16
like

3130.319 --> 3135.2799999999997
i guess other than my own dad or

3132.16 --> 3137.04
something because he he takes

3135.28 --> 3140.079
my experience

3137.04 --> 3140.079
very serious too

3141.839 --> 3146.4
i yeah i cherish him just for having

3144.8 --> 3148.48
been there throughout the different

3146.4 --> 3151.119
phases in my life

3148.48 --> 3154.96
because he's like the only mirror i have

3151.119 --> 3157.52
left that can actually

3154.96 --> 3160.319
reflect

3157.52 --> 3160.319
how i was

3162.0 --> 3165.76
and he can correct me at things he can

3164.319 --> 3168.319
remind me about things that i've

3165.76 --> 3170.6400000000003
forgotten in kind of like my attempt to

3168.319 --> 3172.64
paint it all into it the best most

3170.64 --> 3173.839
cohesive painting

3172.64 --> 3177.2799999999997
memory

3173.839 --> 3178.4
of my past that i can make

3177.28 --> 3181.599
i'm always

3178.4 --> 3182.559
trying to continue the painting not over

3181.599 --> 3184.7200000000003
not

3182.559 --> 3187.76
it's all trying to i'm trying to be

3184.72 --> 3187.7599999999998
accurate with everything

3188.16 --> 3192.16
and express the experience exactly how

3190.24 --> 3195.4399999999996
it was but of course yeah when i was a

3192.16 --> 3197.5989999999997
kid i was a kid and when i was a kid my

3195.44 --> 3199.119
dad wasn't a kid

3197.599 --> 3202.8
and he

3199.119 --> 3204.88
was very improvised improvisory you know

3202.8 --> 3207.3590000000004
he didn't really have a super a lot of

3204.88 --> 3210.88
grip he had the talent

3207.359 --> 3212.88
and he cared he did care

3210.88 --> 3214.96
for my development

3212.88 --> 3215.92
both my parents did from very young age

3214.96 --> 3219.04
on

3215.92 --> 3221.52
so i still have him to reflect on how i

3219.04 --> 3224.319
really was and what that means in the

3221.52 --> 3227.88
context of my growth

3224.319 --> 3227.88
throughout my life

3238.079 --> 3242.559
that's a good interesting bullies are

3239.599 --> 3242.559
not leaders right

3244.319 --> 3250.119
no bullies divide and

3247.119 --> 3250.119
polarize

3268.88 --> 3271.92
oh man

3272.319 --> 3276.359
pretty happy show today

3281.76 --> 3285.48
oh my god

3300.72 --> 3303.72
so

3306.0 --> 3310.24
you don't even feel like you're in your

3307.52 --> 3312.799
brain yeah i mean either

3310.24 --> 3315.68
like i feel like i'm a

3312.799 --> 3318.079
a virtual apparition

3315.68 --> 3320.72
that just happens to be kind of with a

3318.079 --> 3322.48
focal point in certain regions in my

3320.72 --> 3326.3999999999996
brain

3322.48 --> 3326.4
like there's energy loops

3326.48 --> 3332.079
where basically specifically the

3328.64 --> 3334.799
information of my eyes come in where

3332.079 --> 3335.92
yeah that's a very strong point but also

3334.799 --> 3337.92
behind

3335.92 --> 3341.04
there's like this knot and that's where

3337.92 --> 3344.16
my consciousness gathers

3341.04 --> 3347.7599999999998
energy-wise so i kind of regard even my

3344.16 --> 3349.2799999999997
spirit and my consciousness

3347.76 --> 3351.5200000000004
model it out

3349.28 --> 3353.76
as if it were holographic like the

3351.52 --> 3356.64
celestials

3353.76 --> 3359.599
like it's not really there but it's like

3356.64 --> 3359.5989999999997
overlapping

3360.16 --> 3363.799
the physical reality

3365.04 --> 3368.5589999999997
because yeah your consciousness can

3367.44 --> 3369.839
exist

3368.559 --> 3371.92
outside of

3369.839 --> 3375.799
the flesh connections

3371.92 --> 3375.799
even while you're alive

3383.52 --> 3391.0
sounds like an acid trip well yeah well

3386.64 --> 3391.0
everybody has a pineal gland

3400.72 --> 3406.3999999999996
so i don't really know what it

3403.04 --> 3409.359
what that relates to in this setup

3406.4 --> 3409.359
what i describe

3410.24 --> 3413.839
it's just descriptory right

3412.64 --> 3416.319
that's the funny thing about

3413.839 --> 3417.44
descriptions you can attempt to describe

3416.319 --> 3419.599
anything

3417.44 --> 3422.4
anything right including things that

3419.599 --> 3424.4
really cannot be described

3422.4 --> 3426.64
as a substance

3424.4 --> 3428.96
that's like for example what poets do

3426.64 --> 3431.7599999999998
how they attempt to

3428.96 --> 3434.88
describe the experience of love for

3431.76 --> 3436.48
example being in love right

3434.88 --> 3438.7200000000003
why is that interesting

3436.48 --> 3440.96
because it is a thing

3438.72 --> 3443.2799999999997
but it is

3440.96 --> 3445.76
you can only just describe it and in the

3443.28 --> 3447.44
same manner i can only just describe

3445.76 --> 3449.8390000000004
what

3447.44 --> 3453.119
what my sensories

3449.839 --> 3453.119
kind of feed back to me

3455.28 --> 3460.7200000000003
and then use

3456.64 --> 3465.64
comparative other systems the

3460.72 --> 3465.64
to help kick start that imagining

3475.52 --> 3480.7599999999998
i hate to be stuck in john malkovich oh

3477.76 --> 3480.76
god

3497.359 --> 3500.359
huh

3507.2 --> 3511.48
yeah that was a really weird movie

3526.079 --> 3532.6400000000003
that's your soul look no no no

3529.28 --> 3535.6800000000003
no it's your consciousness

3532.64 --> 3535.68
your consciousness

3536.88 --> 3542.88
uses the brain to translate the sensory

3540.0 --> 3542.88
input you have

3543.599 --> 3548.799
it gathers up and the consciousness is

3545.839 --> 3550.96
well that's you and you decided every

3548.799 --> 3552.799
moment what to do with it all

3550.96 --> 3556.16
the soul

3552.799 --> 3556.16
is not literally that

3556.4 --> 3564.48
the soul is more like a

3559.68 --> 3564.48
pool of spiritual energy that you have

3564.559 --> 3568.799
right and you can treat it like a well

3566.96 --> 3572.079
and you have to be very careful that it

3568.799 --> 3574.4
this well doesn't get poisoned

3572.079 --> 3576.559
because it's very tough once it's

3574.4 --> 3577.599
poisoned to clean it up

3576.559 --> 3581.8390000000004
very

3577.599 --> 3581.839
like requires dramatic action

3582.079 --> 3585.2400000000002
and dedication

3587.359 --> 3592.96
but i definitely would not say that the

3589.44 --> 3592.96
consciousness is the soul

3593.599 --> 3597.52
soul is like the other side of the

3595.52 --> 3600.799
consciousness right where the conscious

3597.52 --> 3602.799
is fire the soul is the water

3600.799 --> 3604.319
they're both two poles

3602.799 --> 3606.72
of the same

3604.319 --> 3608.24
spiritual energy mechanism

3606.72 --> 3609.2799999999997
in ways

3608.24 --> 3610.24
right

3609.28 --> 3613.96
they're all

3610.24 --> 3613.9599999999996
very directly connected

3623.359 --> 3629.839
and by the way so it's the spirit

3624.88 --> 3629.839
although rather spirit is more like air

3630.4 --> 3635.359
it's more like the body of energy of of

3633.04 --> 3635.359
it all

3636.24 --> 3638.5589999999997
anyway

3637.28 --> 3641.119
this is all just

3638.559 --> 3643.92
details based on my

3641.119 --> 3646.92
for element

3643.92 --> 3646.92
conception

3674.64 --> 3677.64
hmm

3688.96 --> 3694.7200000000003
the path is not clear okay professor

3691.44 --> 3697.2000000000003
philbo i appreciate that but yeah

3694.72 --> 3699.7599999999998
how could i expect the path to be clear

3697.2 --> 3701.52
when i was always going to know i was

3699.76 --> 3704.6400000000003
always in the knowledge that it was

3701.52 --> 3708.079
going to go right through a thick jungle

3704.64 --> 3712.48
of course the path is not clear

3708.079 --> 3714.7200000000003
it is going right through the jungle

3712.48 --> 3716.559
because there is no other thing

3714.72 --> 3718.319
right you can just

3716.559 --> 3720.88
stay stuck

3718.319 --> 3724.4
at the edge of the jungle while it keeps

3720.88 --> 3724.4
on growing and getting worse

3724.72 --> 3729.2
or you can't just go through it

3727.2 --> 3730.64
and then yeah

3729.2 --> 3732.48
it's gonna wear on you it's gonna be

3730.64 --> 3734.8799999999997
tough you're gonna be

3732.48 --> 3737.44
you're gonna have to bring a machete

3734.88 --> 3739.92
to keep cutting away all the

3737.44 --> 3741.839
the green stuff that's gonna be in your

3739.92 --> 3745.88
way and you're gonna have to be careful

3741.839 --> 3745.88
of snakes and all that

3746.0 --> 3749.13
[Music]

3755.28 --> 3759.28
your soul is conscious no

3763.68 --> 3768.48
well well look woodworking gunny bear

3765.839 --> 3769.7599999999998
that's look this is

3768.48 --> 3772.4
conception

3769.76 --> 3773.92
if in your mechanism you think the soul

3772.4 --> 3776.1600000000003
and the consciousness is one thing

3773.92 --> 3778.4
that's fine right i've already explained

3776.16 --> 3780.64
it's pretty much

3778.4 --> 3780.64
like

3780.88 --> 3786.2400000000002
two poles of one battery

3784.319 --> 3789.359
like

3786.24 --> 3791.5989999999997
you can't effectively exist as a

3789.359 --> 3794.5589999999997
consciousness in my opinion without a

3791.599 --> 3797.44
soul counter pole

3794.559 --> 3798.88
that's why you cannot really lose your

3797.44 --> 3800.319
soul

3798.88 --> 3802.88
but you can

3800.319 --> 3805.2
damage it and poison it

3802.88 --> 3807.28
even to the point where you can just no

3805.2 --> 3810.8799999999997
longer use it and then you're going to

3807.28 --> 3813.28
be like a disjointed consciousness

3810.88 --> 3816.079
drifting

3813.28 --> 3818.3190000000004
not knowing what is what

3816.079 --> 3821.319
morally and emotionally

3818.319 --> 3821.319
anyway

3838.64 --> 3843.839
all right professor phil

3840.16 --> 3843.839
dude i really appreciate the

3843.92 --> 3846.48
the care

3847.359 --> 3852.799
of your advice i really appreciate that

3849.68 --> 3855.9199999999996
and you're right

3852.799 --> 3855.92
it's just like

3862.079 --> 3867.8390000000004
at this point point i'm just like hoping

3864.4 --> 3867.839
can this please just

3868.64 --> 3873.0389999999998
get back to like functioning levels

3870.88 --> 3874.079
where i don't get super stressed out or

3873.039 --> 3876.079
sick

3874.079 --> 3878.48
every time i start a show

3876.079 --> 3878.48
you know

3878.64 --> 3883.52
because i know when i do yeah i'm

3880.799 --> 3884.88
stronger now i am stronger i have more

3883.52 --> 3887.7599999999998
reach i have

3884.88 --> 3890.079
more confidence oh my god do i have more

3887.76 --> 3893.119
confidence in myself and my abilities in

3890.079 --> 3895.28
what i know and in what others know i

3893.119 --> 3898.079
have confidence in what others know i

3895.28 --> 3900.96
trust it more

3898.079 --> 3902.4
based on my ability to analyze and re

3900.96 --> 3905.119
yeah

3902.4 --> 3906.4
back engineer

3905.119 --> 3909.839
other people

3906.4 --> 3909.839
and their spirit

3910.88 --> 3916.6400000000003
i am stronger than it was five years ago

3913.52 --> 3918.319
palpably if you probably compare like

3916.64 --> 3921.2799999999997
today's show

3918.319 --> 3924.16
to like one of my first three shows you

3921.28 --> 3925.6800000000003
immediately see

3924.16 --> 3929.1189999999997
that i have like

3925.68 --> 3931.1189999999997
several layers of energy now much more

3929.119 --> 3933.92
ordered

3931.119 --> 3936.1600000000003
my pronunciation is probably much better

3933.92 --> 3938.319
too

3936.16 --> 3940.16
right

3938.319 --> 3944.24
and i don't have

3940.16 --> 3944.24
that original nervousness

3947.039 --> 3953.119
my nerves now come kind of from well

3951.119 --> 3954.48
the fractal thinking and kind of like

3953.119 --> 3957.44
being forced to just take the

3954.48 --> 3957.44
responsibility

3960.48 --> 3966.559
right back then i didn't

3964.0 --> 3969.359
fractal thinking was a private thing to

3966.559 --> 3969.3590000000004
me always

3971.2 --> 3973.839
i

3972.24 --> 3976.16
i kind of

3973.839 --> 3976.16
in a

3976.839 --> 3982.88
way didn't share it and was like that's

3980.24 --> 3985.2
my special boy power that i can do that

3982.88 --> 3987.76
i feel i'm so much better than everybody

3985.2 --> 3989.7599999999998
else really arrogant

3987.76 --> 3992.6400000000003
and i didn't like

3989.76 --> 3994.96
get on a tour with that [ __ ]

3992.64 --> 3997.2
i'm not like that at all

3994.96 --> 3998.64
but it was always the way i'd had it and

3997.2 --> 4001.2
now

3998.64 --> 4003.1189999999997
for like a couple of years now i am kind

4001.2 --> 4004.0789999999997
of deciding

4003.119 --> 4006.88
this

4004.079 --> 4008.1600000000003
is what i'm gonna be doing

4006.88 --> 4011.039
i'm gonna

4008.16 --> 4013.68
share that gift and see if i can help

4011.039 --> 4016.1600000000003
others to attain it

4013.68 --> 4020.7599999999998
but it does come with a price

4016.16 --> 4020.7599999999998
and i'm also laying out the price

4021.2 --> 4025.1189999999997
just to be honest i don't want to trick

4023.2 --> 4028.319
people in there and because then it

4025.119 --> 4028.319
would just blow back

4028.48 --> 4035.119
right being smart has a price

4031.76 --> 4036.96
actually being smart has a price

4035.119 --> 4039.039
and that doesn't mean oh i read all

4036.96 --> 4040.48
these books

4039.039 --> 4042.7200000000003
although yeah

4040.48 --> 4044.96
when you're actually smart reading a lot

4042.72 --> 4048.16
of books does help

4044.96 --> 4051.44
if you're good at that i haven't i get

4048.16 --> 4051.44
my information differently

4056.72 --> 4059.72
right

4070.88 --> 4074.88
that's a really

4072.88 --> 4077.839
awesome attitude there

4074.88 --> 4077.839
woodworking gunny bear

4078.319 --> 4082.64
yeah

4079.68 --> 4083.9199999999996
it's how i feel too

4082.64 --> 4086.48
it's

4083.92 --> 4090.88
kind of weird in a way i don't even have

4086.48 --> 4093.119
children right not that i know of anyway

4090.88 --> 4093.119
that

4096.319 --> 4100.799
i'm afraid what would happen to the

4098.239 --> 4104.159
world if i was gone

4100.799 --> 4106.56
right i take my that myself that serious

4104.159 --> 4106.5599999999995
actually

4107.12 --> 4111.44
because i can see details and things

4109.759 --> 4112.4
very quickly

4111.44 --> 4115.839
what if

4112.4 --> 4119.839
i wasn't around anymore in order to have

4115.839 --> 4119.839
that ability and talent to share

4125.199 --> 4130.159
but maybe i'm overplaying myself a

4127.12 --> 4131.2789999999995
little when i do that

4130.159 --> 4134.879999999999
i mean

4131.279 --> 4137.679
yeah god saw fit to

4134.88 --> 4140.159000000001
have me designed like this or gave me

4137.679 --> 4142.4
permission to do this

4140.159 --> 4145.44
probably with advice like are you sure

4142.4 --> 4147.92
you want to do this irwin are you sure

4145.44 --> 4149.599999999999
and i'm like i have to do it at all cost

4147.92 --> 4151.92
and now

4149.6 --> 4154.799
20 years later roughly i'm like thinking

4151.92 --> 4156.64
like dude

4154.799 --> 4159.2789999999995
why

4156.64 --> 4163.6
did you have to go so overkill with that

4159.279 --> 4163.6
spiritual dedication like that it's like

4164.159 --> 4168.879999999999
like

4165.12 --> 4173.4
well i know why though i know why

4168.88 --> 4173.400000000001
because there's no way in between

4174.96 --> 4179.6
there's no way in between

4177.12 --> 4182.0
that's why

4179.6 --> 4185.0
i just wish it wasn't like that but it

4182.0 --> 4185.0
isn't

4189.52 --> 4193.839000000001
and i recognized that early on like

4191.6 --> 4196.08
there have been people that like me were

4193.839 --> 4199.04
really trying to

4196.08 --> 4201.36
get a serious grip on society and on

4199.04 --> 4203.76
life and their ideals and how they want

4201.36 --> 4206.5599999999995
to change society

4203.76 --> 4206.56
if you don't

4206.96 --> 4211.52
recognize that when you do that you have

4209.44 --> 4214.4
to basically treat like the entire world

4211.52 --> 4216.400000000001
as your enemy with the punishments that

4214.4 --> 4220.0
come from that and the social reject

4216.4 --> 4220.0
complex etc etc

4220.8 --> 4223.360000000001
then

4222.4 --> 4224.639999999999
they

4223.36 --> 4226.639999999999
end up

4224.64 --> 4229.679
grafting into

4226.64 --> 4231.6
the society anyway and then suddenly all

4229.679 --> 4234.08
the things that they were so dedicated

4231.6 --> 4235.76
about doing they suddenly like no i

4234.08 --> 4238.48
don't think that anymore because i've

4235.76 --> 4239.4400000000005
accepted this

4238.48 --> 4242.0
which

4239.44 --> 4243.759999999999
is like a diplomatic decision or a

4242.0 --> 4245.36
business decision

4243.76 --> 4247.84
but really when you think about it

4245.36 --> 4250.48
carefully it is an unacceptable

4247.84 --> 4250.4800000000005
acceptance

4250.96 --> 4255.36
and that happens

4252.88 --> 4257.84
to the majority of people including the

4255.36 --> 4260.239
really smart

4257.84 --> 4262.64
saw that around me i paid attention to

4260.239 --> 4265.04
that [ __ ] even when i was 12. what were

4262.64 --> 4266.56
adults doing that were really smart

4265.04 --> 4267.76
how were they

4266.56 --> 4269.6
building

4267.76 --> 4272.08
how were they building their lives how

4269.6 --> 4274.4800000000005
were they building their plants

4272.08 --> 4277.28
i noticed this i paid attention i was a

4274.48 --> 4280.718999999999
psychiatrist my entire life guys my

4277.28 --> 4281.84
entire life even as a very little kid

4280.719 --> 4285.28
always

4281.84 --> 4287.679
studying humans why do they do this how

4285.28 --> 4290.0
does intelligence really work how does

4287.679 --> 4292.4800000000005
it change everything

4290.0 --> 4296.32
and how this freaking social

4292.48 --> 4296.32
automated hierarchy works

4297.28 --> 4300.92
this the social

4300.96 --> 4305.56
collective societal ladder

4303.6 --> 4307.4400000000005
what is that that

4305.56 --> 4310.080000000001
undescribable thing

4307.44 --> 4312.32
that everybody utilizes automatically

4310.08 --> 4314.96
and they don't even really it's like

4312.32 --> 4317.12
just go with it but they don't know what

4314.96 --> 4320.159
they're going with and how it works

4317.12 --> 4322.88
i wanted to know that

4320.159 --> 4322.879999999999
and i'm learning

4327.679 --> 4332.4
who

4328.4 --> 4335.44
coined fractal thinking i did

4332.4 --> 4335.44
i did canada bear

4337.28 --> 4341.159
at least i hope so

4343.04 --> 4348.32
yeah lateral thinking is different

4345.36 --> 4350.799999999999
that's more tactical fractal thinking

4348.32 --> 4353.36
is a description of the medium of the

4350.8 --> 4353.360000000001
process

4354.48 --> 4358.799999999999
to basically think

4356.64 --> 4360.0
with whatever you're thinking always

4358.8 --> 4361.679
realize

4360.0 --> 4363.76
there's no end

4361.679 --> 4366.159
to if there's no end to information you

4363.76 --> 4369.280000000001
see every time you say something

4366.159 --> 4371.36
it has an influence on different people

4369.28 --> 4373.5199999999995
with different levels of understanding

4371.36 --> 4376.96
different

4373.52 --> 4379.84
levels of reference

4376.96 --> 4382.4
information to reflect upon it

4379.84 --> 4385.04
and the time factor and what they're

4382.4 --> 4388.08
going to be caught up in at the moment

4385.04 --> 4389.92
and then later how will people later

4388.08 --> 4391.28
reflect on it in all those same

4389.92 --> 4393.92
categories

4391.28 --> 4396.0
right that's fractal thinking to know

4393.92 --> 4398.4
with whatever you do how is it going to

4396.0 --> 4399.6
branch out

4398.4 --> 4402.32
and then

4399.6 --> 4404.719
get a feel for it it's

4402.32 --> 4404.719
hard

4409.36 --> 4414.719
like yeah

4410.719 --> 4414.719
fractal meanings in symbolism right

4416.239 --> 4420.48
although that's more like fractal

4417.679 --> 4420.4800000000005
implications

4422.8 --> 4428.320000000001
right and there's fractal insight on all

4425.84 --> 4429.92
kinds of different levels from the very

4428.32 --> 4433.84
superficial

4429.92 --> 4436.159
to the super deep philosophical heavy

4433.84 --> 4436.159000000001
stuff

4436.4 --> 4439.36
there's fractal implications on every

4438.239 --> 4442.4
level

4439.36 --> 4446.0
with almost everything you do

4442.4 --> 4449.04
so it's just smart to get a feel

4446.0 --> 4451.12
for the consequences of it

4449.04 --> 4454.88
because it's gonna be there right

4451.12 --> 4456.08
whether your consciousness of it or not

4454.88 --> 4460.159000000001
fractal

4456.08 --> 4462.719
implications are there always

4460.159 --> 4462.719
forever

4465.92 --> 4469.1990000000005
anyway i'm gonna run out the show it's

4467.92 --> 4471.6
kind of a shame it's because it's

4469.199 --> 4475.5199999999995
turning really good

4471.6 --> 4475.52
got a bit emotional earlier

4476.719 --> 4480.4
but i feel much better now

4480.96 --> 4483.84
it was interesting

4485.76 --> 4488.320000000001
but yeah

4488.719 --> 4493.52
