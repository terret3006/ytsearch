so yeah today she can already see it's

102.18 --> 106.56
hot again

104.579 --> 108.899
and

106.56 --> 111.5
yeah it's kind of like weird hazy

108.899 --> 111.5
strides

111.78 --> 116.219
just like no wind and that's like the

113.82 --> 118.32
real problem here it

116.219 --> 120.96
it is just

118.32 --> 123.24
there is a little bit of wind sometimes

120.96 --> 124.979
but it's just a lot of moist in the air

123.24 --> 126.53999999999999
you can see it like even in the back

124.979 --> 129.32
there

126.54 --> 129.32
just

129.959 --> 133.81900000000002
and yeah it's just nothing like

131.819 --> 136.67999999999998
yesterday yesterday was just a really

133.819 --> 139.45899999999997
invigorating cool day

136.68 --> 139.459
but today

139.58 --> 143.42000000000002
just hot

148.02 --> 152.64000000000001
yeah look it's hanging outside no

150.78 --> 156.44
surprise I wouldn't be hanging inside

152.64 --> 156.44
too if I wasn't having a show

158.879 --> 164.7
foreign

160.519 --> 167.22
trying to keep the doors open

164.7 --> 169.319
because sometimes a bit of a wind streak

167.22 --> 171.78
comes by and then

169.319 --> 174.61999999999998
is nice but it's not really anything

171.78 --> 174.62
substantial

175.86 --> 179.12
like it doesn't persist

179.459 --> 184.62
right

181.62 --> 184.62
anyway

185.159 --> 190.94
got some

187.739 --> 190.94
cold water

191.22 --> 196.43
gusto

193.25 --> 196.43

okay I'm just gonna go freeze again it

232.62 --> 236.72

233.879 --> 236.72
let me prep

237.959 --> 243.2
here we go

240.0 --> 243.2
but yeah in the uh

243.56 --> 248.939
2019 Amsterdam conference

247.14 --> 252.85999999999999

248.939 --> 252.85999999999999
and he gave me ranty's camera

256.44 --> 264.24
have you been on a flat smacking tour

I was there like I did I was almost

264.24 --> 270.36
gonna join like the globe light tour but

267.6 --> 273.90000000000003
it was like two certain

270.36 --> 277.139
and I was just too nervous and

273.9 --> 278.63899999999995
I was gonna get sick and a lot of people

277.139 --> 280.919
were right

278.639 --> 283.22
it's like a big flu thing was gonna

280.919 --> 283.21999999999997
happen

283.74 --> 287.78000000000003
like later that month

288.36 --> 293.88
and so I just wouldn't do it

291.06 --> 296.94
but I did like go flat smacking at the

293.88 --> 298.919
uh Amsterdam train station

296.94 --> 301.44
Amsterdam Central

298.919 --> 304.74

301.44 --> 306.9
oh yeah of course I met Adam meekin also

304.74 --> 310.40000000000003
forget about that I had to share the

306.9 --> 310.4
bunk the guy so

313.68 --> 319.62
Jaren correct I almost forgot yeah I did

316.86 --> 322.62

322.62 --> 327.259
Dave Murphy indeed yeah

327.6 --> 332.78000000000003
a video you found a video

330.24 --> 332.78000000000003
really

333.66 --> 339.38000000000005
huh

335.66 --> 339.38000000000005
I wonder why that

341.58 --> 348.02
right yeah that time

344.4 --> 348.02
when my hair was all terrible

348.3 --> 352.5
because I had forgotten my comb yeah I

350.639 --> 353.40000000000003
remember that it was still great fun

352.5 --> 354.78
though

353.4 --> 357.71999999999997
I was like

354.78 --> 360.55999999999995
fooling around with my p900 I got still

357.72 --> 360.56
photos of that

361.68 --> 364.52
I'll show you

365.699 --> 368.6
uh

376.979 --> 380.35999999999996
hope I can find them

385.199 --> 390.66
yeah

387.419 --> 393.44
uh Adam Meekins on it

390.66 --> 393.44
uh

414.419 --> 417.08
right

417.24 --> 421.22
it was like the best photo I made

421.5 --> 429.139
I think at least but that was also there

426.36 --> 429.139
the same location

443.06 --> 451.319
scuba Dracula holding that Banner

448.02 --> 453.68
yeah good times I did have a lot a ton

451.319 --> 453.68
of fun

456.72 --> 461.22
it was like the first time for me

458.759 --> 465.5
meeting any flat earther from online

461.22 --> 465.5
face to face so it was pretty incredible

471.9 --> 474.44
right

476.58 --> 480.9
anyway hello clutch

479.22 --> 483.62
forgot you there

480.9 --> 483.62
are you doing

515.039 --> 521.8389999999999
it's a timestamp for

517.979 --> 521.839
goody come on

523.019 --> 527.519
anyway did you guys check out

525.48 --> 531.4200000000001
the Hindi

527.519 --> 533.76
letter streamer I was on

531.42 --> 537.26
did yeah of course territory were

533.76 --> 537.26
probably able to follow that easy

542.58 --> 547.5600000000001
did you know Tara I went on the

545.64 --> 549.899
Pakistani stream he got all super

547.56 --> 552.18
enthusiastic about it

549.899 --> 555.8
be basically I got in the chat during

552.18 --> 555.8
the live stream and then he invited me

575.64 --> 580.8
oh yeah

578.1 --> 581.88
yeah that time I had just gotten my

580.8 --> 584.779
mustache

581.88 --> 584.779
hahaha

586.32 --> 591.019
now it's more along more Chinese style

608.76 --> 613.079
you could translate it all I thank you

611.04 --> 615.5999999999999
for that turret but the funny thing was

613.079 --> 619.5
like I was a part on it

615.6 --> 622.74
and the rest mostly them talking and

619.5 --> 624.48
they had like a baller rumpus and Hindi

622.74 --> 627.0600000000001
bowler rumpus guy

624.48 --> 629.22
and I could just perfectly like it was

627.06 --> 632.579
almost listening to Nathan Oakley versus

629.22 --> 634.98
like akumu virus or something

632.579 --> 636.959
except it wasn't it was less extreme

634.98 --> 638.94
more polite but it was just you could

636.959 --> 641.0999999999999
follow what they were talking about and

638.94 --> 643.8000000000001
like even what the guy was doing or when

641.1 --> 646.399
he was rumpusing

643.8 --> 646.399
like

648.54 --> 653.6999999999999
pigeons

651.48 --> 655.88
yeah they like that fresh water don't

653.7 --> 655.88
they

661.5 --> 664.579
go open it down

674.04 --> 678.12
right what yeah getting distracted here

676.38 --> 680.72
right it's hot okay so I'm gonna get

678.12 --> 680.72
distracted

681.779 --> 687.779
yeah they use a lot of English words but

684.18 --> 691.9799999999999
they use the key words they use like

687.779 --> 694.26
what they learned from the science field

691.98 --> 696.72
and so you can just follow what they're

694.26 --> 698.24
talking about the rest is just like a

696.72 --> 701.4590000000001
bunch of Hindi

698.24 --> 704.22
but just how they talk

701.459 --> 707.6999999999999
I can just follow with just a couple of

704.22 --> 711.1800000000001
keywords what what is going on it's like

707.7 --> 713.1600000000001
really easy to follow for me at least I

711.18 --> 715.68
had and it was just interesting to see

713.16 --> 716.959
like the similarities

715.68 --> 720.06
like

716.959 --> 723.7199999999999
baller versus flat earther conversations

720.06 --> 727.0189999999999
like that's not unique to English it

723.72 --> 730.32
happens like that in all languages

727.019 --> 733.139
that's that's what I think

730.32 --> 735.74
and this was one of the proofs for that

733.139 --> 735.74
English

760.139 --> 766.86
all right anyway that was fun

763.98 --> 769.5600000000001
uh yesterday also in the afternoon yeah

766.86 --> 771.36
there was no freaking ah

769.56 --> 773.2199999999999
letters debate

771.36 --> 774.6
I was just running out to show and then

773.22 --> 776.82
joined

774.6 --> 778.0790000000001
looked in Skype and like there's a

776.82 --> 779.4590000000001
premiere

778.079 --> 781.4399999999999
what the [ __ ]

779.459 --> 783.1199999999999
so yeah hopefully today Nathan will

781.44 --> 786.6800000000001
Street it seems like it had to do with

783.12 --> 786.68
something with computer issues

786.72 --> 792.48
so he said

789.12 --> 795.0
and uh hopefully today there will be a

792.48 --> 796.86
live stream if not I well

795.0 --> 799.62
too bad

796.86 --> 801.92
but yeah instead of that I watched the

799.62 --> 801.92
uh

802.32 --> 806.779
that movie with Rick Mayo

807.06 --> 809.88
that I found

808.38 --> 813.68
um

809.88 --> 813.68
uh on bit shoot

816.66 --> 819.86
what was it called again

836.639 --> 839.54
foreign

846.26 --> 851.42
by one

848.639 --> 851.42
that's it

851.88 --> 857.04
yeah I had I did actually recognize it

855.42 --> 859.26
eventually I had seen it before I

857.04 --> 861.48
recognized it at the end

859.26 --> 864.36
I have seen this movie one time before

861.48 --> 866.279
but when I was watching it was a very

864.36 --> 869.22
different time

866.279 --> 871.199
and I was like really disapproving of

869.22 --> 872.6990000000001
this movie because I thought that's like

871.199 --> 875.279
your

872.699 --> 876.779
trying to Gaslight us

875.279 --> 879.0
like

876.779 --> 880.74
what because of the movie was basically

879.0 --> 883.579
released

880.74 --> 886.32
the the

883.579 --> 890.04
basic setup was

886.32 --> 891.4200000000001
yeah people they lose somebody they love

890.04 --> 894.24
and then

891.42 --> 897.18
they get caught up because of their

894.24 --> 899.639
extreme grief into conspiracy sizing and

897.18 --> 901.3199999999999
then yeah New World Order stuff and

899.639 --> 902.82
depopulation specifically about

901.32 --> 906.9590000000001
depopulation

902.82 --> 910.74
which by the way is real

906.959 --> 913.079
like that part that

910.74 --> 914.88
and we have the proof

913.079 --> 917.16
because it happened

914.88 --> 921.0
how that movie ended

917.16 --> 925.3199999999999
kind of on an open scary note yeah

921.0 --> 927.66
they were right it has happened it has

925.32 --> 928.74
happened what in that movie it has

927.66 --> 930.899
happened

928.74 --> 932.639
it didn't happen exactly like they

930.899 --> 935.04
thought it would happen because that was

932.639 --> 939.0600000000001
the mindset of back then much more up

935.04 --> 941.519
close personal and paranoid I was like

939.06 --> 943.02
that too and because the movie was a bit

941.519 --> 944.699
late with it

943.02 --> 947.399
[Music]

944.699 --> 949.019
right it was like

947.399 --> 950.519
10 years

949.019 --> 953.279
late

950.519 --> 955.5600000000001
like what was going on in that movie was

953.279 --> 957.959
kind of like 10 years before that a lot

955.56 --> 960.4399999999999
of people had issues like that exactly

957.959 --> 960.4399999999999
like that

962.279 --> 965.82
right but

963.61 --> 967.38
[Music]

965.82 --> 970.38
back then I thought like oh you're

967.38 --> 972.06
trying to Gaslight Us by just showing oh

970.38 --> 974.16
grief

972.06 --> 976.8599999999999
conspiracy theory

974.16 --> 979.259
out of control paranoia you might wake

976.86 --> 982.38
up the wrong person that will just like

979.259 --> 984.1800000000001
try to arrest you for being a terrorist

982.38 --> 985.62
and I thought that was annoying because

984.18 --> 988.56
I thought they were trying to Gaslight

985.62 --> 993.0600000000001
us to discourage

988.56 --> 996.4799999999999
but now watching it back so much later

993.06 --> 999.899
it is really more like a contemporary

996.48 --> 1003.74
piece of art of social commentary Arts

999.899 --> 1006.74
that I could not see then because I was

1003.74 --> 1008.3
too immersed in actually in that whole

1006.74 --> 1010.399
situation

1008.3 --> 1013.579
it's way too into it

1010.399 --> 1017.44
to see that about it and now watching

1013.579 --> 1017.4399999999999
back it's really interesting

1018.8 --> 1021.8599999999999
and

1020.18 --> 1023.12
very human

1021.86 --> 1026.66
like

1023.12 --> 1029.86
it's very drama

1026.66 --> 1031.419
based but human like a sensible

1029.86 --> 1034.52
sensitive

1031.419 --> 1037.039
intellectual and sensitivity

1034.52 --> 1039.26
was really a part of what's going on in

1037.039 --> 1041.36
that movie and yeah I do appreciate it

1039.26 --> 1043.039
it's not the sound quality is kind of

1041.36 --> 1046.6989999999998
shitty

1043.039 --> 1048.86
it's just like yeah so the music is way

1046.699 --> 1051.98
too loud the conversations way too low

1048.86 --> 1053.8999999999999
volume like really annoying at that part

1051.98 --> 1055.52
I had to like turn it up really high and

1053.9 --> 1057.6200000000001
then suddenly a party starts into my

1055.52 --> 1060.98
eardrums almost blow out

1057.62 --> 1063.08
that Bell was [ __ ] annoying but other

1060.98 --> 1066.98
than that

1063.08 --> 1070.46
really interesting watching that back

1066.98 --> 1072.919
what an odd odd movie

1070.46 --> 1074.8400000000001
and like the way it starts you totally

1072.919 --> 1077.24
don't expect that

1074.84 --> 1078.98
you totally don't expect it to become

1077.24 --> 1081.86
like that

1078.98 --> 1084.42
it's really interesting the transition

1081.86 --> 1086.78
anyway

1084.42 --> 1090.799
[Music]

1086.78 --> 1094.82
so yeah one by one what an odd movie

1090.799 --> 1098.059
but very interesting to watch back now

1094.82 --> 1100.22
because back then nothing had a really

1098.059 --> 1103.52
happened to to the level that they

1100.22 --> 1106.4
suggested would happen yet and they said

1103.52 --> 1108.1399999999999
like it's gonna happen guys it is gonna

1106.4 --> 1109.8200000000002
happen

1108.14 --> 1114.0800000000002
and guess what

1109.82 --> 1116.84
we're in 2022 and it has happened

1114.08 --> 1119.08
blatantly what the [ __ ] is up with my

1116.84 --> 1119.08
camera

1119.539 --> 1123.52
[ __ ] you camera stop freezing

1132.98 --> 1137.98
have you done a GoFundMe like Nathan

1135.32 --> 1137.98
yeah for what

1148.4 --> 1153.26
yeah PGC I heard he said that I I know

1151.34 --> 1156.3799999999999
he's dead

1153.26 --> 1158.539
like not too long after that movie

1156.38 --> 1161.5390000000002
but I had yeah

1158.539 --> 1163.16
I think I saw that clip one time

1161.539 --> 1166.059
long time ago

1163.16 --> 1166.059
new camera

1167.3 --> 1176.6789999999999
[Music]

1173.9 --> 1176.679
uh

1182.299 --> 1186.679
I don't even know if a new camera would

1184.76 --> 1190.1
actually fix it

1186.679 --> 1192.799
I think it is like the

1190.1 --> 1196.1
the USB port

1192.799 --> 1197.9
or if not it is literally some weird

1196.1 --> 1201.08
[ __ ] Spirit that's just trying to

1197.9 --> 1203.1200000000001
[ __ ] with us and it's not me alone that

1201.08 --> 1204.799
that happens with

1203.12 --> 1207.02
happens with Matt from Quantum of

1204.799 --> 1209.539
conscious it happens to own Benjamin it

1207.02 --> 1211.82
happens to all kinds of people

1209.539 --> 1214.539
that's a very expressive relationship

1211.82 --> 1214.539
with the public

1215.6 --> 1221.24
right yesterday no camera freeze zero

1219.44 --> 1222.799
not a single time

1221.24 --> 1225.919
nothing

1222.799 --> 1228.08
and then one day it's just like oh no

1225.919 --> 1229.76
today we're gonna we're gonna get in

1228.08 --> 1233.1789999999999
your face now we're gonna freeze

1229.76 --> 1235.94
constantly 20 times in a row

1233.179 --> 1238.88
not 20 times what you know what I mean

1235.94 --> 1241.22
I don't literally need a new camera if

1238.88 --> 1243.5200000000002
anything I'd need like a completely new

1241.22 --> 1243.52
computer

1243.559 --> 1246.82
and a new monitor

1247.4 --> 1251.5590000000002
so sure I'd love to do a GoFundMe for

1250.039 --> 1255.679
what is it

1251.559 --> 1257.96
yeah make it 2 000 Euros

1255.679 --> 1260.419
and then I can get a completely new

1257.96 --> 1261.6200000000001
computer set that is really up to date

1260.419 --> 1263.6000000000001
and all that

1261.62 --> 1267.4399999999998
yeah I'd love to

1263.6 --> 1270.8799999999999
but I could also just

1267.44 --> 1270.88
make sure I get to eat

1287.48 --> 1293.44
yeah I know

1289.82 --> 1295.9399999999998
so yeah it's just annoying I know

1293.44 --> 1297.74
annoying to me mostly

1295.94 --> 1299.24
I mean some of you don't even really

1297.74 --> 1301.4
look at me

1299.24 --> 1303.26
while I do things

1301.4 --> 1305.8400000000001
but

1303.26 --> 1307.76
yeah as long as the mic doesn't do that

1305.84 --> 1308.8999999999999
and it hasn't been

1307.76 --> 1310.8799999999999
like

1308.9 --> 1314.2
doing that so

1310.88 --> 1314.2
things fine for now

1314.48 --> 1316.78
all right

1323.18 --> 1326.43
[Music]

1327.14 --> 1329.8600000000001
hmm

1331.7 --> 1334.24
foreign

1339.34 --> 1343.8999999999999
yeah but that's very rare though

1346.82 --> 1352.72
although yeah and yeah

1350.0 --> 1352.72
look

1368.179 --> 1373.52
look we're gonna go for equipment I

1371.36 --> 1374.7199999999998
would really like to have my air filter

1373.52 --> 1378.32
back

1374.72 --> 1379.7
I mean I try to GoFundMe for that was it

1378.32 --> 1382.1
now

1379.7 --> 1383.059
two years ago three years ago I don't

1382.1 --> 1385.76
remember

1383.059 --> 1387.9189999999999
that never worked out

1385.76 --> 1389.419
I would really like to have one that

1387.919 --> 1393.0200000000002
works again

1389.419 --> 1396.22
I mean really I would really like that

1393.02 --> 1396.22
but that does cost

1401.0 --> 1403.419
so

1407.419 --> 1413.17
let's see how much

1408.63 --> 1413.17
[Music]

1414.74 --> 1417.74
foreign

1454.82 --> 1460.1589999999999
so yeah

1456.5 --> 1462.32
anything I'd like to have like a good

1460.159 --> 1464.779
air filter back

1462.32 --> 1467.12
I mean I deal with a lot of dust would

1464.779 --> 1470.74
be extremely helpful and good for my

1467.12 --> 1470.7399999999998
long-term Health if I had that

1487.7 --> 1492.74
foreign

1489.38 --> 1495.14
but look if Nathan

1492.74 --> 1496.64
wants to update his systems and he's

1495.14 --> 1499.4
doing the GoFundMe that's his

1496.64 --> 1502.72
prerogative if if everybody wants him to

1499.4 --> 1502.72
have that and he'll have that

1503.419 --> 1510.5590000000002
I am mostly just going by what I need

1507.32 --> 1513.08
look if I like oh do GoFundMe for

1510.559 --> 1515.0
everything I'd like dude

1513.08 --> 1519.1999999999998
like

1515.0 --> 1522.32
that's a lot of things really

1519.2 --> 1524.6000000000001
do they really need them no because I

1522.32 --> 1526.039
have been getting around without it

1524.6 --> 1528.52
most of it

1526.039 --> 1528.52
so

1535.4 --> 1541.159
but hey if you guys are like hey

1538.22 --> 1543.32
do a GoFundMe I wouldn't do it

1541.159 --> 1545.5390000000002
do it about something

1543.32 --> 1548.96
sure

1545.539 --> 1550.279
I could do that or could focus on doing

1548.96 --> 1552.5
the show again

1550.279 --> 1554.86
a lot well again I do it all the time

1552.5 --> 1554.86
but

1564.08 --> 1569.0
all right

1565.4 --> 1573.919
but yeah if you guys really really want

1569.0 --> 1577.22
the the stupid disconnect nuisance

1573.919 --> 1580.159
to stop I'm gonna have to get like a

1577.22 --> 1583.279
completely new computer like with a new

1580.159 --> 1585.14
motherboard in a new

1583.279 --> 1588.039
box

1585.14 --> 1588.039
all that

1590.24 --> 1595.46
that's going to be expensive

1592.76 --> 1599.539
but then if I'd had that it is

1595.46 --> 1601.52
absolutely guaranteed that like that

1599.539 --> 1604.1589999999999
that these nuisances are not gonna

1601.52 --> 1606.62
happen anymore that is a guarantee then

1604.159 --> 1610.159
if that's worth it to you guys I mean

1606.62 --> 1612.5
I'll get around with this I mean

1610.159 --> 1615.5
you know as long as long as my computer

1612.5 --> 1616.7
just doesn't like randomly starts blue

1615.5 --> 1618.14
screening

1616.7 --> 1619.82
I'm okay

1618.14 --> 1621.8600000000001
right that was the issue with the

1619.82 --> 1623.72
previous motherboard it started randomly

1621.86 --> 1627.3999999999999
blue screening that is extremely

1623.72 --> 1627.4
annoying and disruptive

1627.44 --> 1632.0
and computers are extractively expensive

1629.24 --> 1633.74
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock I know that

1632.0 --> 1635.36
how expensive is the new system than

1633.74 --> 1636.86
else it's just as expensive as

1635.36 --> 1639.8799999999999
everywhere else

1636.86 --> 1639.8799999999999
maybe more

1640.7 --> 1646.159
if I'm gonna get it here I'm gonna

1642.62 --> 1650.86
assemble it from scratch

1646.159 --> 1650.8600000000001
using tweakers.net as a guide

1664.159 --> 1666.8200000000002
hmm

1668.08 --> 1674.48
okay pgac net that is yeah if somebody

1672.26 --> 1678.2
said that before by the way

1674.48 --> 1680.3600000000001
that could be a solution to

1678.2 --> 1682.3990000000001
Maybe

1680.36 --> 1684.6789999999999
it's no guarantee that that would

1682.399 --> 1686.9799999999998
actually solve the issue permanently

1684.679 --> 1686.98
though

1698.059 --> 1700.72
hmm

1708.74 --> 1711.3990000000001
foreign

1726.26 --> 1731.36
okay

1728.48 --> 1734.38
oh that doesn't even look too expensive

1731.36 --> 1734.3799999999999
all right

1739.82 --> 1744.6399999999999
yeah I guess that is doable

1745.399 --> 1750.6999999999998
I could get one for like 30 Euros

1797.059 --> 1799.12
um

1817.22 --> 1825.14
okay I found one that would probably

1820.22 --> 1827.659
work for 25 Euros it's like a four USB

1825.14 --> 1830.679
port there's more too but they get they

1827.659 --> 1830.679
have bad reviews

1832.82 --> 1836.6789999999999
I could get that I guess

1838.34 --> 1843.08
if somebody's gonna send me like 25

1840.799 --> 1847.399
Euros through the PayPal and tells me

1843.08 --> 1849.74
get that USB card I will order it I will

1847.399 --> 1853.0
literally do that

1849.74 --> 1853.0
I could do it right now

1863.299 --> 1868.8799999999999
picking up you till yeah all the time

1865.519 --> 1871.58
see me try like I am super anal when it

1868.88 --> 1872.8600000000001
comes to keeping my computer clean

1871.58 --> 1877.299
like

1872.86 --> 1880.4599999999998
too like nerd level

1877.299 --> 1883.7
well well nerd level would go beyond but

1880.46 --> 1885.58
I know that that would be the case

1883.7 --> 1889.22
because I know it could be even worse

1885.58 --> 1891.6789999999999
but yeah dude I am like

1889.22 --> 1895.1000000000001
cleaning up my room

1891.679 --> 1899.0
is something I learned to do after I

1895.1 --> 1901.58
learned to clean up my computer

1899.0 --> 1905.24
did I try reading no

1901.58 --> 1907.519
the [ __ ] why the hell would I do that

1905.24 --> 1911.38
no it has absolutely nothing to do with

1907.519 --> 1911.38
it this is not a software failure

1921.519 --> 1928.0
make sure any power savings

1925.399 --> 1928.0
what

1928.46 --> 1931.419
ah

1933.039 --> 1940.12
I've never even checked that

1936.559 --> 1940.12
but yeah

1940.46 --> 1944.779
yeah you might actually have a point

1942.679 --> 1947.179
there

1944.779 --> 1950.799
I'm gonna make a note of this because I

1947.179 --> 1950.799
will [ __ ] forget to do that

1980.36 --> 1984.32
[Music]

1981.86 --> 1986.1789999999999
right I'll I'll try to check that out as

1984.32 --> 1989.24
soon as I get the opportunity to restart

1986.179 --> 1991.76
my computer thank you for that

1989.24 --> 1994.519
but by the way

1991.76 --> 1997.399
the USB ports still work even if my

1994.519 --> 1999.799
computer is turned off really like I can

1997.399 --> 2000.82
just use this fan even if my computer is

1999.799 --> 2003.7
turn off

2000.82 --> 2006.36
which is plugged in through the USB

2003.7 --> 2006.3600000000001
so

2006.64 --> 2010.0800000000002
I don't know if that means anything

2015.7 --> 2022.3600000000001
if nothing has changed well something

2018.94 --> 2024.48
has changed PJ see that I had an

2022.36 --> 2029.519
entirely new motherboard

2024.48 --> 2029.519
so yeah something has definitely changed

2037.779 --> 2042.36
the power settings what

2045.6 --> 2051.399
dude can we please not talk about

2048.7 --> 2053.98
detailed computer maintenance right now

2051.399 --> 2054.879
during the early bird show that would be

2053.98 --> 2057.339
great

2054.879 --> 2059.3199999999997
unless you specifically want me to

2057.339 --> 2062.94
absolutely not talk about anything

2059.32 --> 2062.94
interesting Beyond this point

2065.32 --> 2068.409
[Music]

2077.679 --> 2083.56
right I'll check those things

2080.26 --> 2085.8
let's please move on now thank you very

2083.56 --> 2085.7999999999997
much

2086.8 --> 2092.139
this is going to be the most boring

2088.48 --> 2095.17
freaking Flat Earth early bird show

2092.139 --> 2098.36
today don't want that

2095.17 --> 2098.36
[Music]

2103.06 --> 2106.24
stop

2104.74 --> 2109.4799999999996
I'm done

2106.24 --> 2111.22
okay do I need to get pissed off to get

2109.48 --> 2113.7400000000002
that through to you can we please stop

2111.22 --> 2115.4199999999996
being robots again and get back to human

2113.74 --> 2118.0789999999997
beings

2115.42 --> 2118.079
thank you

2127.9 --> 2133.119
all right so I had a very elaborate set

2130.599 --> 2134.32
of title

2133.119 --> 2137.32
foreign

2134.32 --> 2137.32
yesterday

2137.74 --> 2141.4799999999996
Jim Bob had a great stream

2144.52 --> 2149.619
was it it was just really interesting

2147.339 --> 2152.68
and weird because there was this young

2149.619 --> 2156.4
guy in there it was like sort of goth

2152.68 --> 2158.2599999999998
and he was just annoying in a sense that

2156.4 --> 2160.119
he was constantly just oh I want to do

2158.26 --> 2163.1800000000003
this but he can't do this in this world

2160.119 --> 2166.42
and like dude

2163.18 --> 2168.22
like yeah I know what that's like I have

2166.42 --> 2170.079
certain issues like that too and they

2168.22 --> 2173.3799999999997
persist even now

2170.079 --> 2175.599
but I'm not just gonna be oblivious like

2173.38 --> 2177.88
an ass and just say that on a live

2175.599 --> 2179.98
recording like that

2177.88 --> 2182.8
I mean Jesus Christ have some

2179.98 --> 2184.72
self-awareness and he eventually figured

2182.8 --> 2187.5
that out and just went all embarrassed

2184.72 --> 2187.5
smiley face

2188.74 --> 2194.04
but it was funny like Jim Bob and posh

2194.2 --> 2199.06
and all that all right oh like just

2196.839 --> 2200.92
really trying to get to him and so did I

2199.06 --> 2203.44
at first I just started attacking him

2200.92 --> 2205.96
from the chat like wow this guy is like

2203.44 --> 2208.359
super gay he doesn't even realize it

2205.96 --> 2209.859
like not actually homosexual but just

2208.359 --> 2212.3199999999997
really gay

2209.859 --> 2216.04
called himself gray and he was a young

2212.32 --> 2218.8590000000004
guy that freaking painted his hair gray

2216.04 --> 2219.64
I cannot think of a gayer thing to do to

2218.859 --> 2222.4
that

2219.64 --> 2224.2
so I made sure that everybody got to

2222.4 --> 2226.48
know that in the chat

2224.2 --> 2228.9399999999996
for like five minutes straight

2226.48 --> 2231.4
but then after that it was kind of like

2228.94 --> 2233.92
a session of just

2231.4 --> 2236.38
teenage psychology and then I kind of

2233.92 --> 2239.76
like turned around and got pretty

2236.38 --> 2239.76
enthusiastic about that

2240.099 --> 2246.339
so that was fun

2242.859 --> 2248.2
over it made by Jim Bob Channel

2246.339 --> 2252.0
do you want to see me go ballistic in

2248.2 --> 2252.0
chat then check out that stream

2253.18 --> 2256.02
uh

2256.54 --> 2259.079
foreign

2264.54 --> 2268.32
get this title from

2272.52 --> 2276.7
I don't know where I plucked it I think

2275.02 --> 2279.099
I got this all from when I was

2276.7 --> 2281.3199999999997
dreamwalking

2279.099 --> 2283.06
because it is a complete mix

2281.32 --> 2284.26
a whole bunch of it and also Owen

2283.06 --> 2286.74
Benjamin

2284.26 --> 2286.7400000000002
think

2287.079 --> 2289.7400000000002
oh

2290.44 --> 2296.26
and I watched a movie yesterday very

2293.02 --> 2298.5
late forgotten like an action movie

2296.26 --> 2301.6200000000003
thing

2298.5 --> 2304.82
let's call it reconnaissance

2301.62 --> 2304.8199999999997
[Music]

2306.3 --> 2309.8390000000004
with Tom Cruise

2310.3 --> 2316.119
but like not as a good guy

2314.02 --> 2319.48
what's really interesting actually in

2316.119 --> 2322.2000000000003
that movie like that was

2319.48 --> 2322.2
different

2325.3 --> 2329.94
also because everything was just really

2330.7 --> 2336.04
like not oh action boom boom boom but

2334.599 --> 2339.4
just

2336.04 --> 2343.3
like really shown as what it is as like

2339.4 --> 2346.06
the real darkness with like really still

2343.3 --> 2346.96
frame shots of just him blowing people

2346.06 --> 2350.5
up

2346.96 --> 2353.2
just blowing them off like that like not

2350.5 --> 2356.02
action movie romantic so actually it

2353.2 --> 2359.6189999999997
wasn't an action movie at all

2356.02 --> 2362.52
it was much more of a like a dark

2359.619 --> 2362.52
drama

2363.46 --> 2368.28
weird movie interesting though

2373.78 --> 2378.3390000000004
psychology is used to excuse bad

2376.54 --> 2381.7
behavior no

2378.339 --> 2384.96
no it's too correct

2381.7 --> 2384.96
bad behavior

2385.24 --> 2388.74
it's not excuse

2389.38 --> 2395.32
you use it to understand it

2392.619 --> 2397.599
and then you can correct somebody right

2395.32 --> 2399.7000000000003
if you understand what somebody's going

2397.599 --> 2402.1600000000003
through then you can reflect that back

2399.7 --> 2404.14
on them and then perhaps give them an

2402.16 --> 2406.359
Insight that they did not have or could

2404.14 --> 2409.2999999999997
not reach because it was blocked

2406.359 --> 2411.7799999999997
so that then they can choose to correct

2409.3 --> 2411.78
themselves

2413.68 --> 2421.3799999999997
psychology is not an excuse ever

2417.16 --> 2421.3799999999997
it is an analytical ability

2423.04 --> 2427.359
how many movies do I watch in a week I

2425.38 --> 2429.6400000000003
don't know sometimes I watch one every

2427.359 --> 2431.74
day or so even two and other times I

2429.64 --> 2433.5989999999997
just don't watch any movies for like a

2431.74 --> 2436.319
month

2433.599 --> 2436.319
I don't know

2437.44 --> 2442.48
a lot of the times I just kind of like

2439.56 --> 2444.4
listen to shows or

2442.48 --> 2446.92
like have Alex Jones Show in the

2444.4 --> 2449.44
background which is not really super

2446.92 --> 2451.78
super interesting most of the time

2449.44 --> 2454.859
so it's like a background thing and then

2451.78 --> 2454.8590000000004
I just like play a game

2455.5 --> 2459.22
like civilization five

2457.72 --> 2463.5
for the

2459.22 --> 2463.5
Ten Thousand and One Time

2478.78 --> 2484.42
blowing them off for a moment

2482.26 --> 2486.7200000000003
thought she said blowing them off what

2484.42 --> 2486.7200000000003
no

2491.2 --> 2494.9399999999996
is that what you got from what I said

2496.44 --> 2502.599
lva no no gym Bob and Posh and me and

2500.98 --> 2504.579
Chad and other guys we were all getting

2502.599 --> 2506.5
invested because first we just thought

2504.579 --> 2509.079
he was a gamma [ __ ]

2506.5 --> 2513.28
that guy

2509.079 --> 2515.2000000000003
with the the gray gay hair

2513.28 --> 2518.079
because he was just making excuses but

2515.2 --> 2520.839
he didn't go gamma rage he was just like

2518.079 --> 2524.38
oh [ __ ] you're kind of right actually so

2520.839 --> 2526.66
he was like having that the teenage

2524.38 --> 2529.359
high threshold he just needed a little

2526.66 --> 2531.46
push a little discipline some parental

2529.359 --> 2534.2799999999997
inspiration that's literally what's

2531.46 --> 2537.16
happening so he didn't give a gamma out

2534.28 --> 2540.94
response and then everybody just got

2537.16 --> 2544.48
invested like like he was your our kid

2540.94 --> 2547.3
that was the effect that was happening

2544.48 --> 2549.599
so he he did do his best and we've

2547.3 --> 2553.7200000000003
dragged all of us have challenged him

2549.599 --> 2555.94
like you're gonna go get that job now

2553.72 --> 2557.56
because you did mention something it was

2555.94 --> 2559.3
just a funny

2557.56 --> 2562.119
situation

2559.3 --> 2565.2400000000002
and kind of interesting hey Amanda young

2562.119 --> 2568.98
good to see you psych bear

2565.24 --> 2568.9799999999996
they were not blowing him off

2571.18 --> 2575.74
no

2573.22 --> 2578.74
that's weird

2575.74 --> 2580.06
now we weren't like oh no they they were

2578.74 --> 2581.6189999999997
just trying to get to him like Hey

2580.06 --> 2583.54
you're making excuses for yourself

2581.619 --> 2586.54
you're you're

2583.54 --> 2588.7599999999998
creating a labyrinth for yourself not to

2586.54 --> 2591.099
it to go and do the thing that you just

2588.76 --> 2595.1800000000003
need to do and not worry about

2591.099 --> 2598.599
don't Envision how it doesn't work

2595.18 --> 2599.9199999999996
just do or do not I went all Yoda on his

2598.599 --> 2603.1600000000003
ass and chat

2599.92 --> 2605.7400000000002
because it really really applies in so

2603.16 --> 2607.96
many ways it was amazing so yeah it was

2605.74 --> 2609.5789999999997
the energy moment it was interesting it

2607.96 --> 2612.88
was amusing

2609.579 --> 2615.76
again Bob always interesting streams

2612.88 --> 2617.92
sometimes really like nerdy

2615.76 --> 2620.44
philosophical and then it gets annoying

2617.92 --> 2621.73
to me because it's also

2620.44 --> 2622.96
conceptual

2621.73 --> 2625.839
[Music]

2622.96 --> 2628.96
yet disciplined and it's annoying

2625.839 --> 2633.24
other times it's just really interesting

2628.96 --> 2633.2400000000002
what happens over at made by Jim Bob

2634.599 --> 2639.579
ah

2637.18 --> 2639.96
the temperature is finally getting

2639.579 --> 2642.1600000000003
better

2639.96 --> 2644.16
[Music]

2642.16 --> 2644.16
um

2649.78 --> 2655.0600000000004
see the FBI reset related to Trump

2652.54 --> 2657.22
alleged attacks against FBI yeah like

2655.06 --> 2660.099
they look State yeah they did

2657.22 --> 2664.3799999999997
or even weirder

2660.099 --> 2664.38
Trump might have set them up

2665.26 --> 2671.92
I did a little skit yesterday where I

2667.42 --> 2674.7400000000002
would like Trump calling the FBA

2671.92 --> 2677.2200000000003
he might have like give them gave them a

2674.74 --> 2677.22
false tip

2679.48 --> 2685.839
to let them trigger a stunt that he

2683.14 --> 2688.319
could use as a political

2685.839 --> 2688.319
stick

2691.0 --> 2698.02
right but the FBI reset is

2694.599 --> 2702.9
an FBI reset doesn't mean FBI scrapping

2698.02 --> 2706.859
right because a lot of these silly

2702.9 --> 2710.079
easily convinced

2706.859 --> 2713.5789999999997
gojim in America that just do anything

2710.079 --> 2717.099
that their sight says

2713.579 --> 2720.94
they are gonna say that oh scrap the FBI

2717.099 --> 2722.92
just FBI get rid of it entirely like

2720.94 --> 2725.5
there's already this kind of talk going

2722.92 --> 2727.599
around right

2725.5 --> 2730.9
that would be really stupid and Owen

2727.599 --> 2733.599
Benjamin has laid out exactly why

2730.9 --> 2735.339
because the FBI in America is the

2733.599 --> 2738.2400000000002
primary force that's actually going

2735.339 --> 2742.72
after pedophiles

2738.24 --> 2747.9399999999996
hello and you want to scrap them oh oh

2742.72 --> 2750.8799999999997
that's not gonna backfire at all oh no

2747.94 --> 2753.76
are you trying to create a little crisis

2750.88 --> 2755.38
eh they're into trying to create and

2753.76 --> 2758.1400000000003
create a little crisis

2755.38 --> 2759.1600000000003
they'll create new creative crisis for

2758.14 --> 2761.7999999999997
the future

2759.16 --> 2763.18
so you can play the hero and fix the

2761.8 --> 2764.8590000000004
crisis

2763.18 --> 2767.9199999999996
yeah

2764.859 --> 2771.52
oh oh you didn't see it coming oh then

2767.92 --> 2776.819
you're just stupid then okay right but

2771.52 --> 2776.819
yeah don't scrap the FBI reset it

2778.48 --> 2783.599
just

2779.88 --> 2783.599
reset their function

2783.88 --> 2791.099
they're being politically abused

2787.48 --> 2791.099
and it is kept that way

2792.04 --> 2797.319
what the hell are you talking about

2793.619 --> 2801.1800000000003
shares enforce the law not politics

2797.319 --> 2801.18
the [ __ ] are you talking about

2803.56 --> 2808.96
what do you mean oh it is wrong

2806.38 --> 2811.48
that doesn't make any sense

2808.96 --> 2816.0
it's not something I said or even

2811.48 --> 2816.0
paraphrased about what Owen said there

2816.64 --> 2821.3799999999997
politicians enforce the law no it's

2819.099 --> 2823.48
they're being political politicized

2821.38 --> 2826.599
they're being used

2823.48 --> 2829.96
or political stunts the F by bi is

2826.599 --> 2829.96
become propagandized

2830.92 --> 2834.7200000000003
they're kind of like the Stasi

2835.24 --> 2841.0
like a propaganda Department to enforce

2838.359 --> 2845.2599999999998
a political will

2841.0 --> 2847.9
so what FBI is being utilized for

2845.26 --> 2850.1400000000003
but that's separate from them literally

2847.9 --> 2855.119
just doing pedophile

2850.14 --> 2855.1189999999997
research and tracking down and all that

2862.42 --> 2866.16
are not law enforcement

2868.66 --> 2871.2599999999998
what

2874.96 --> 2880.0
oh what

2877.48 --> 2882.4
the [ __ ] not a law enforcement

2880.0 --> 2884.5
department what what the hell does that

2882.4 --> 2886.839
even mean

2884.5 --> 2889.9
that's separate

2886.839 --> 2894.2999999999997
dude you're just confusing me now I I

2889.9 --> 2894.3
don't see like what is your point

2895.9 --> 2900.64
I mean

2897.579 --> 2904.2400000000002
I'm sorry was I being that detailed

2900.64 --> 2907.18
about the exact way to pronounce an

2904.24 --> 2908.859
exact compartment lies jurisdiction like

2907.18 --> 2912.359
dude what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2908.859 --> 2912.359
I wasn't even talking about that

2912.579 --> 2919.3590000000004
there's FBI

2915.16 --> 2921.96
that does go after pedophiles

2919.359 --> 2921.96
they do

2928.18 --> 2932.94
it's like these sheriffs can investigate

2930.28 --> 2932.94
all crimes

2933.16 --> 2938.6189999999997
okay

2935.38 --> 2941.98
I what is your point okay can you please

2938.619 --> 2944.02
just make your point because I am like

2941.98 --> 2945.46
getting a bit annoyed here because I

2944.02 --> 2947.8
don't even know what your point is

2945.46 --> 2949.839
you're just saying no no this and that

2947.8 --> 2951.7000000000003
and that I don't understand

2949.839 --> 2955.119
what is your point why are you saying

2951.7 --> 2957.7
that how does that

2955.119 --> 2960.48
like dispute or contradict anything that

2957.7 --> 2960.48
I've even said

2961.66 --> 2966.0989999999997
did you please clarify lva

2977.91 --> 2980.969
[Music]

2982.839 --> 2986.22
no Charter

2987.64 --> 2990.48
okay

2999.46 --> 3005.0
what if they just got a charter or I

3002.64 --> 3005.0
don't know

3008.22 --> 3013.4399999999996
so look what you're saying is that the

3011.339 --> 3015.72
way it's set up the FBI is kind of

3013.44 --> 3019.02
already a political thing

3015.72 --> 3022.02
through the feds

3019.02 --> 3023.339
so then the sheriff should take over

3022.02 --> 3025.68
that function

3023.339 --> 3027.0
or they should get their own Charter I

3025.68 --> 3028.859
technically don't even know what that

3027.0 --> 3030.48
means I've heard the word before but I

3028.859 --> 3032.2799999999997
don't actually know exactly what it

3030.48 --> 3035.04
means I think it's like a a code of

3032.28 --> 3037.38
conduct rule list or something like it

3035.04 --> 3039.24
go to conduct Constitution something

3037.38 --> 3042.3
like that but

3039.24 --> 3046.3799999999997
yeah sure the point is

3042.3 --> 3049.5
there's FBI involved in pedophile things

3046.38 --> 3053.059
in in like getting them

3049.5 --> 3053.059
finding them keeping track

3053.16 --> 3059.16
CA has a charter right okay so then

3056.579 --> 3061.8
maybe they should get a charter then

3059.16 --> 3064.859
maybe that's the new item that would be

3061.8 --> 3067.319
the FBI reset where they get a charter

3064.859 --> 3072.0
and are no longer just

3067.319 --> 3074.46
like an imperial arm for politics

3072.0 --> 3076.68
which I guess is what they are if they

3074.46 --> 3079.14
have no Charter it's just they could do

3076.68 --> 3081.7999999999997
whatever they're directed to do

3079.14 --> 3081.7999999999997
then

3084.119 --> 3088.859
okay that makes sense

3086.819 --> 3091.92
so either you

3088.859 --> 3095.5789999999997
give the FBI a charter

3091.92 --> 3098.66
or you disband them and then kind of

3095.579 --> 3103.3390000000004
like move those activities over and

3098.66 --> 3103.339
rearrange them under the sheriff system

3104.579 --> 3108.42
right

3105.78 --> 3110.0400000000004
okay well now see now I actually

3108.42 --> 3111.9
understand what

3110.04 --> 3114.7799999999997
what you were talking about right

3111.9 --> 3117.9
because for me it wasn't like oh the

3114.78 --> 3119.94
exact hierarchy and jurisdiction Charter

3117.9 --> 3121.7400000000002
I guess for me it was just like oh

3119.94 --> 3124.079
there's people there that are really

3121.74 --> 3125.64
doing this work that kind of necessary

3124.079 --> 3129.7200000000003
right now

3125.64 --> 3132.2999999999997
like that's really necessary so you

3129.72 --> 3135.0
can't just like it felt like oh we're

3132.3 --> 3138.78
gonna shut down the FBI to literally

3135.0 --> 3141.3
just seize all the pedophile hunting

3138.78 --> 3143.94
that's what it felt like and that's all

3141.3 --> 3147.1800000000003
when Benjamin felt that too and I did I

3143.94 --> 3150.9
agreed with that and I think that

3147.18 --> 3152.54
in a general sentiment you agree as well

3150.9 --> 3154.98
you just

3152.54 --> 3157.5589999999997
approached my comfort yeah the

3154.98 --> 3160.7400000000002
conversation here in the chat

3157.559 --> 3162.599
with more like a technical approach of

3160.74 --> 3164.839
jurisdiction and Charters that makes

3162.599 --> 3164.839
sense

3166.92 --> 3172.98
I'm glad we had this little talk

3170.4 --> 3173.88
right I didn't know that I didn't have a

3172.98 --> 3176.54
charter

3173.88 --> 3176.54
no idea

3177.359 --> 3181.43
right

3179.22 --> 3184.5
so

3181.43 --> 3184.5
[Music]

3185.28 --> 3189.48
political Shenanigans yeah yeah oh but

3188.04 --> 3192.359
it was

3189.48 --> 3193.44
and I think that the FBI was literally

3192.359 --> 3198.73
set up to do that

3193.44 --> 3198.73
[Music]

3213.839 --> 3219.0589999999997
hmm

3216.059 --> 3219.059
right

3219.48 --> 3225.059
yeah so that that specific Department

3222.0 --> 3228.72
should definitely be

3225.059 --> 3232.619
Safeguard it and also many transfers

3228.72 --> 3236.2799999999997
gonna happen of jurisdiction there

3232.619 --> 3238.079
keep the freaking eye out because an

3236.28 --> 3240.7200000000003
organization like that

3238.079 --> 3242.54
is going to be prime target for

3240.72 --> 3245.4599999999996
infiltration

3242.54 --> 3247.92
especially if things suddenly rearrange

3245.46 --> 3251.4
right leadership interconnection with

3247.92 --> 3254.099
other departments Rich individuals power

3251.4 --> 3256.319
individuals if it's going to migrate

3254.099 --> 3258.3590000000004
that's the ultimate time for the

3256.319 --> 3259.38
gravelish to start digging in with their

3258.359 --> 3261.96
hands

3259.38 --> 3264.359
because nobody sees it at the beginning

3261.96 --> 3267.0
when they do that they're gonna try to

3264.359 --> 3269.52
dig in and corrupt it

3267.0 --> 3272.94
especially if it's really functional so

3269.52 --> 3275.579
far right I mean there's nothing more

3272.94 --> 3278.7000000000003
terrible for a Grappler

3275.579 --> 3282.0
than an uncorrupted

3278.7 --> 3283.2
like crime investigation like especially

3282.0 --> 3285.059
like

3283.2 --> 3288.5989999999997
child's

3285.059 --> 3291.48
crime related investigation agency like

3288.599 --> 3294.2400000000002
they want to have that control just like

3291.48 --> 3296.88
they wanted with the judges

3294.24 --> 3298.2
and all kinds of fields

3296.88 --> 3301.26
right

3298.2 --> 3304.4399999999996
so be careful because they are going to

3301.26 --> 3306.599
try to gravel it I guarantee it

3304.44 --> 3309.18
in this coming period they're gonna try

3306.599 --> 3312.0
to get in there ruin it or completely

3309.18 --> 3314.0989999999997
disband the whole thing and like make

3312.0 --> 3315.96
sure that all the research is all lost

3314.099 --> 3318.7200000000003
so that all these pedophiles can just

3315.96 --> 3322.68
slip into anonymity again they want to

3318.72 --> 3325.02
do that they want not the the FBI or

3322.68 --> 3326.5789999999997
even the people in the FBI you know the

3325.02 --> 3329.7599999999998
Grapplers

3326.579 --> 3332.52
the Demonic the demonically possessed

3329.76 --> 3333.48
scumbags that are trying to destroy the

3332.52 --> 3335.16
world

3333.48 --> 3336.9
they want that

3335.16 --> 3340.64
the Grapplers

3336.9 --> 3340.64
and they will make their moves

3347.88 --> 3350.48
hmm

3353.94 --> 3357.5
okay Stephen Traveler

3368.78 --> 3374.76
but would I change myself dude I'm not

3372.18 --> 3377.46
doing anything steamy traveler I'm just

3374.76 --> 3380.599
trying to analyze and report on what I

3377.46 --> 3380.599
think might be happening

3383.16 --> 3387.7799999999997
I mean

3384.54 --> 3391.16
what lva has been saying about it so far

3387.78 --> 3397.0400000000004
seems sensible enough you could just

3391.16 --> 3397.04
redesignate FBI under Sheriff's system

3399.72 --> 3403.64
or just yeah

3404.7 --> 3409.799
rework

3406.799 --> 3412.079
the yeah the what is it the status the

3409.799 --> 3414.119
statutory Charter

3412.079 --> 3416.54
but I don't know I don't even know

3414.119 --> 3418.92
exactly what the details are I am not

3416.54 --> 3420.96
extremely researched in this I'm not

3418.92 --> 3424.28
even American like why the hell would I

3420.96 --> 3424.28
even research all that

3440.88 --> 3446.88
so yeah what would you change one of

3443.339 --> 3451.2599999999998
dude I'm not the guy to ask

3446.88 --> 3453.559
I mean ask a political Think Tank like a

3451.26 --> 3453.559
good one

3454.2 --> 3460.319
or ask a bunch of conspiracy theorists

3457.619 --> 3462.599
that are really into this stuff they

3460.319 --> 3464.819
have their own think tanks

3462.599 --> 3466.98
I bet some of them don't even realize

3464.819 --> 3469.319
that they are being parasited on for

3466.98 --> 3472.14
ideas and like their

3469.319 --> 3475.02
back engineered reconstructions of what

3472.14 --> 3477.54
they think is happening out there what

3475.02 --> 3481.02
the evil ones are doing are often used

3477.54 --> 3482.64
as very as the very blueprints by those

3481.02 --> 3485.52
people

3482.64 --> 3489.319
like game Masters they just leech ideas

3485.52 --> 3489.319
from people that oppose them

3492.18 --> 3498.96
I know that happens out there

3495.359 --> 3500.04
because it's so easy it's so easy to do

3498.96 --> 3504.359
it now

3500.04 --> 3506.579
just a bunch of algorithms extract data

3504.359 --> 3509.22
the specific type of data from

3506.579 --> 3511.319
somebody's activities

3509.22 --> 3513.72
and then you can literally just like oh

3511.319 --> 3516.359
thank you thank you extracted data from

3513.72 --> 3518.5789999999997
person that seems like a really good

3516.359 --> 3520.98
position to take from this vantage point

3518.579 --> 3523.619
maybe with a couple of modifications

3520.98 --> 3527.819
that you hadn't predicted

3523.619 --> 3529.859
thank you for those useful tips

3527.819 --> 3531.48
and what you think the enemy would do

3529.859 --> 3533.94
that's great

3531.48 --> 3535.92
because we don't have any ideas we're

3533.94 --> 3537.299
all depleted here

3535.92 --> 3539.46
right

3537.299 --> 3543.119
because they are the darkness is always

3539.46 --> 3546.0
depleted they always seek out the light

3543.119 --> 3548.2200000000003
for inspiration because they are

3546.0 --> 3550.26
depleted they don't have light that's

3548.22 --> 3552.0589999999997
the point

3550.26 --> 3554.46
they're so narrowed down they don't have

3552.059 --> 3558.38
any more options so they have to

3554.46 --> 3558.38
steal it from the light

3562.859 --> 3568.92
Jake this I don't give a fleeting [ __ ]

3567.0 --> 3571.079
what Jake

3568.92 --> 3573.54
has to [ __ ] say about anything

3571.079 --> 3575.4
classical homeopath why the hell would

3573.54 --> 3579.0
you even bring that disgusting name up

3575.4 --> 3580.619
in my chat I'm serious like why the [ __ ]

3579.0 --> 3584.839
do you care

3580.619 --> 3584.839
the guy is a sick bastard

3596.94 --> 3603.359
dude I'd rather watch Joe Rogan

3601.079 --> 3604.1400000000003
then Jake the [ __ ] and that's saying

3603.359 --> 3605.64
something

3604.14 --> 3608.4
God

3605.64 --> 3611.46
sorry that's fine it's just I'm

3608.4 --> 3613.079
disappointed in you like that you just

3611.46 --> 3614.88
like oh yeah I'm gonna share that

3613.079 --> 3617.88
because that's something people want to

3614.88 --> 3620.04
hear right really so you've degenerated

3617.88 --> 3622.7400000000002
to that level have you

3620.04 --> 3624.599
do you know that that is like really

3622.74 --> 3628.3799999999997
degenerate

3624.599 --> 3631.26
do you know or did you forget did you

3628.38 --> 3633.359
forget that he is a degenerate

3631.26 --> 3635.96
and that you should be ashamed to even

3633.359 --> 3635.96
know him

3638.339 --> 3641.24
did you

3646.079 --> 3650.96
yeah and even degenerates can be right

3648.42 --> 3650.96
about things

3655.01 --> 3658.2090000000003
[Music]

3660.96 --> 3667.2
said Joe Rogan yeah

3664.14 --> 3670.68
no I said I'd rather watch Joe Rogan

3667.2 --> 3673.799
Than Jake the [ __ ] and I would never

3670.68 --> 3676.02
watch Joe Rogan like every time any I

3673.799 --> 3678.299
even see a clip of him I'd like turning

3676.02 --> 3680.28
off after five seconds because just

3678.299 --> 3682.74
hearing his voice for just three seconds

3680.28 --> 3685.3190000000004
makes me want to throw up

3682.74 --> 3687.9799999999996
the guy is so [ __ ] disgusting it's

3685.319 --> 3687.98
unbelievable

3693.42 --> 3699.92
Benjamin no AGM you're a [ __ ]

3697.079 --> 3699.92
you're dumb

3700.5 --> 3704.64
you don't like own Benjamins your

3702.54 --> 3706.44
[ __ ] problem go squirt in a corner

3704.64 --> 3711.0789999999997
then

3706.44 --> 3711.079
to call him a small hat is [ __ ]

3712.859 --> 3716.94
I don't know if you've actually watched

3714.78 --> 3719.579
his stream in a while probably not

3716.94 --> 3721.5
because to say that is so [ __ ] dumb

3719.579 --> 3724.319
it literally proves you haven't been

3721.5 --> 3727.079
paying attention whatsoever

3724.319 --> 3729.619
I mean he had a giant segment on the

3727.079 --> 3734.96
show yesterday crying out loud

3729.619 --> 3734.96
effectively attacking Israel okay

3735.72 --> 3741.299
this is a small hat oh yes yes he is

3739.2 --> 3744.2599999999998
sure hey Jim you don't even know what

3741.299 --> 3744.2599999999998
the [ __ ] you're talking about

3748.5 --> 3752.88
you don't know what the hell you're

3750.24 --> 3754.6189999999997
talking about it's really dumb to say

3752.88 --> 3756.42
something like that especially in my

3754.619 --> 3761.1600000000003
chat

3756.42 --> 3761.16
as an entry point AGM

3766.32 --> 3769.4190000000003
[Music]

3779.01 --> 3785.4
[Music]

3781.7 --> 3787.5589999999997
besides despite what you say not being

3785.4 --> 3789.48
true makes you sound kind of like

3787.559 --> 3791.6400000000003
anti-Semitic

3789.48 --> 3795.359
it really does

3791.64 --> 3797.22
not that that word even means anything

3795.359 --> 3799.799
but effectively that is what you're

3797.22 --> 3801.72
doing by saying that

3799.799 --> 3804.18
oh what so I shouldn't watch own

3801.72 --> 3806.52
Benjamin because according to you he is

3804.18 --> 3808.799
allegedly a Jew which is ridiculous

3806.52 --> 3813.02
because yesterday he literally attacked

3808.799 --> 3813.02
Israel pretty openly

3813.42 --> 3817.02
on his show

3815.039 --> 3819.2990000000004
and he does that's not like the first

3817.02 --> 3821.339
time he does that so none of anything

3819.299 --> 3823.2
you say makes no sense

3821.339 --> 3826.64
so

3823.2 --> 3826.64
let me wakey wakey yeah

3832.5 --> 3837.48
always starts talking about yeah I know

3834.839 --> 3839.7799999999997
I don't like that too it hey he's not

3837.48 --> 3839.78
perfect

3840.059 --> 3843.38
he gets kind of gross

3853.859 --> 3861.44
who is a former comedian that you enjoy

3856.619 --> 3864.599
what the hell you mean former comedian

3861.44 --> 3867.539
Owen's not a former comedian he is still

3864.599 --> 3869.94
a comedian very much so he literally

3867.539 --> 3873.6600000000003
still does stand up

3869.94 --> 3876.299
when he yeah goes to places so

3873.66 --> 3878.7799999999997
weird thing to say right

3876.299 --> 3882.66
any other comedian I like listening to

3878.78 --> 3887.1800000000003
no no not really I hadn't really enjoyed

3882.66 --> 3887.18
comedians in decades

3887.88 --> 3892.26
because they all say things that suck in

3890.339 --> 3894.7799999999997
between it and that just makes me like

3892.26 --> 3897.059
okay well go [ __ ] yourself then it's not

3894.78 --> 3898.6800000000003
[ __ ] funny yeah if you're stupid and

3897.059 --> 3901.5
you're not in the know that sounds like

3898.68 --> 3903.72
funny or like all that is like of that

3901.5 --> 3907.92
so oh now that's supposed to be funny

3903.72 --> 3910.5589999999997
hahaha is liberal funny funny for stupid

3907.92 --> 3912.1800000000003
people that like to laugh Along on a

3910.559 --> 3914.6400000000003
hunch when they have absolutely no

3912.18 --> 3916.319
[ __ ] idea what's even going on that

3914.64 --> 3919.2599999999998
type of funny yeah I don't like that

3916.319 --> 3921.66
type of funny I think it sucks now

3919.26 --> 3924.8390000000004
I don't know any comedians out there

3921.66 --> 3927.48
that I truly think are funny

3924.839 --> 3929.819
Owen Benjamin can be funny and I don't

3927.48 --> 3932.339
even think he's always funny and at

3929.819 --> 3935.0
least he's just trying

3932.339 --> 3935.0
you know

3936.66 --> 3943.859
it's a Jewish grandparent silver yeah

3941.099 --> 3945.839
so

3943.859 --> 3948.5389999999998
what are you saying that Jewish is

3945.839 --> 3952.2
genetic now

3948.539 --> 3956.2200000000003
like dude you even know what a Jew is

3952.2 --> 3959.0989999999997
do you do you know what a Jew is

3956.22 --> 3960.24
what a ridiculous thing to say

3959.099 --> 3962.52
so

3960.24 --> 3965.7599999999998
you're saying like

3962.52 --> 3968.64
a Jew is a race then

3965.76 --> 3970.6800000000003
and because you had a grandparent that

3968.64 --> 3973.3799999999997
might be Jewish

3970.68 --> 3976.74
that means that you automatically become

3973.38 --> 3979.4
like a Jew that's such a ridiculous

3976.74 --> 3979.3999999999996
thing to say

3980.16 --> 3984.2
really think about it

3988.859 --> 3992.46
hey guns have never run

3991.44 --> 3995.4
yeah

3992.46 --> 3997.079
thank you I agree Owen is definitely a

3995.4 --> 3999.48
good asset for the truth Community he's

3997.079 --> 4001.039
very pure he doesn't try to sneak [ __ ]

3999.48 --> 4004.76
through

4001.039 --> 4008.1400000000003
but he is kind of sexual he always was

4004.76 --> 4011.42
he used to be like a yeah

4008.14 --> 4013.0989999999997
boning all the ladies type and that

4011.42 --> 4015.6800000000003
doesn't really go away

4013.099 --> 4017.539
not really he's all monogamous now but

4015.68 --> 4019.819
that that's still still gonna Echo that

4017.539 --> 4023.78
shit's still going to Echo in your head

4019.819 --> 4026.9
just like if you'll allow yourself to do

4023.78 --> 4030.799
gay things you're gonna have literal gay

4026.9 --> 4033.319
nightmares the rest of your [ __ ] life

4030.799 --> 4035.9
it's the same thing once you sin

4033.319 --> 4038.18
you get addicted to the sin you become

4035.9 --> 4043.52
the sin and then you can't escape from

4038.18 --> 4043.52
it anymore happens to everyone everyone

4046.819 --> 4052.18
to crypto weren't you accused of being

4049.22 --> 4052.18
one yes yes yes

4052.46 --> 4057.319
dude

4054.02 --> 4060.579
if I was a crypto Jew

4057.319 --> 4060.579
I wouldn't know it

4061.099 --> 4067.2200000000003
isn't that the entire point

4064.76 --> 4069.3190000000004
the crypto Jew is a Jew that doesn't

4067.22 --> 4070.7
know they're a Jew

4069.319 --> 4072.619
so

4070.7 --> 4074.5389999999998
it's kind of pointless to ask somebody

4072.619 --> 4076.46
are you a crypto Jew

4074.539 --> 4078.7400000000002
because if they even knew what that was

4076.46 --> 4083.26
then they'd answer it like

4078.74 --> 4083.2599999999998
you know I would know even if I was

4115.159 --> 4120.04
if Arwin is encrypted you then you're a

4117.44 --> 4120.04
Santa Claus

4120.14 --> 4125.659000000001
well I haven't seen any actual pictures

4122.96 --> 4127.159
from you yet unless that icon is a

4125.659 --> 4128.719
picture

4127.159 --> 4131.42
I don't know

4128.719 --> 4133.699
you live like in Canada right I mean

4131.42 --> 4135.38
technically you could be Santa Claus

4133.699 --> 4139.239
arguably

4135.38 --> 4139.2390000000005
so maybe I am a crypto Jew

4141.319 --> 4146.839000000001
right so if you just put on a white

4144.44 --> 4151.159
beard and a red costume

4146.839 --> 4153.859
then let's see if you are Santa Claus

4151.159 --> 4155.7789999999995
right I mean even Santa Claus can put up

4153.859 --> 4158.299
regular clothing

4155.779 --> 4159.799000000001
that doesn't make him not Santa Claus it

4158.299 --> 4162.56
just doesn't look like Santa Claus

4159.799 --> 4166.06
anymore so

4162.56 --> 4166.06
yeah don't worry about the caps

4169.339 --> 4174.44
right I'm not saying I'm not a crypt out

4171.5 --> 4176.239
Jew I'm just saying if I were

4174.44 --> 4177.799
then I would know

4176.239 --> 4180.5599999999995
I might be

4177.799 --> 4183.859
but I don't know if I am

4180.56 --> 4186.02
which is funnily enough yeah that is

4183.859 --> 4189.679
what a crypto Jew

4186.02 --> 4191.839000000001
has like that it crypto Jew if they are

4189.679 --> 4194.54
one then they would know

4191.839 --> 4197.239
so in that sense I could be

4194.54 --> 4199.1
right now if I said no I am a Jew now

4197.239 --> 4201.139999999999
then immediately you're not a crypto Jew

4199.1 --> 4204.219
anymore because you actually consciously

4201.14 --> 4204.219
know that you're a Jew

4204.38 --> 4207.1
but I don't

4212.179 --> 4217.82
anybody who is poor cannot be a Jew yes

4215.48 --> 4219.32
but that might be the ultimate gravel

4217.82 --> 4222.799999999999
though

4219.32 --> 4223.82
it might be the ultimate camouflage like

4222.8 --> 4225.92
like

4223.82 --> 4230.0
I would be like no that's that's

4225.92 --> 4234.679
terrible thing to say it's no nothing

4230.0 --> 4239.0
no not gonna say it's too far but

4234.679 --> 4242.06
yeah maybe I'm just poor

4239.0 --> 4243.44
as part of an undercover effort of being

4242.06 --> 4246.26
a crypto Jew

4243.44 --> 4248.48
right I mean how would I ever find out

4246.26 --> 4251.4800000000005
that my that I'm a Jew because I'm poor

4248.48 --> 4255.139999999999
nobody would ever think of me as a Jew

4251.48 --> 4259.178999999999
so it is the perfect Undercover

4255.14 --> 4259.179
situation for a crypto Jew

4261.08 --> 4263.5599999999995
right

4264.98 --> 4268.94
but anyway it's kind of pointless to

4266.78 --> 4270.679
discuss this because I'm not gonna find

4268.94 --> 4273.919999999999
out as soon as you

4270.679 --> 4276.32
know you're a crypto Jew that's the end

4273.92 --> 4278.78
of you being a crypto Jew

4276.32 --> 4280.88
also it may invoke sort of a soft

4278.78 --> 4283.4
paradox

4280.88 --> 4285.38
because as soon as you know

4283.4 --> 4288.44
you're a crypto Jew that immediately

4285.38 --> 4293.12
undoes you being a crypto Jew

4288.44 --> 4295.639999999999
but if you then forget that then

4293.12 --> 4297.44
you might be a crypto Jew again so it's

4295.64 --> 4299.780000000001
just it all depends on where your mind

4297.44 --> 4302.919999999999
is dwelling at that point

4299.78 --> 4302.92
getting a bit complicated

4304.219 --> 4309.26
there are poor Jews damn it

4307.46 --> 4311.8
don't make things more difficult for me

4309.26 --> 4311.8
Jim West

4328.04 --> 4331.179
you win

4331.34 --> 4336.52
I prefer the r over the Jew thank you

4340.4 --> 4344.379999999999
Jew talk is getting boring okay

4347.42 --> 4353.2390000000005
I just had to do that because

4350.0 --> 4354.679
some dumbass earlier said

4353.239 --> 4357.08
and talking about you classical

4354.679 --> 4360.52
homeopath

4357.08 --> 4360.5199999999995
calling Owen Benjamin

4367.88 --> 4374.62
what exactly did you say

4370.88 --> 4374.62
all right so it's a while ago

4377.42 --> 4380.36
anyway

4378.56 --> 4383.080000000001
let's go about Buddhism what the [ __ ] is

4380.36 --> 4383.08
there to talk about

4384.38 --> 4389.08
are you serious like what is there to

4386.719 --> 4389.08
talk about

4401.179 --> 4407.92
okay Terry 306

4405.08 --> 4407.92
okay

4409.46 --> 4412.54
what are

4413.42 --> 4416.4400000000005
low atom price

4421.82 --> 4428.799999999999
yeah no thanks Tara 306 I'll just skip

4424.64 --> 4428.8
on the stupid made up [ __ ] stories

4452.42 --> 4455.08
uh

4485.42 --> 4490.28
right but oh God I'm gonna bring it back

4488.12 --> 4493.76
to the Jew talk a bit

4490.28 --> 4495.5599999999995
I'm sorry I had more to come

4493.76 --> 4499.34
so the thing about

4495.56 --> 4503.620000000001
if you're going for Jew

4499.34 --> 4503.62
well what if you don't even know that

4504.02 --> 4508.64
that it isn't a singular thing that

4507.08 --> 4512.48
there's like different directions that

4508.64 --> 4516.38
wildly oppose each other

4512.48 --> 4519.28
that for some reason both agreed to call

4516.38 --> 4519.28
each other Jew

4521.42 --> 4525.92
that's weird [ __ ]

4523.46 --> 4527.78
because there was a time when I did

4525.92 --> 4531.62
think like yeah I want to be a Jew

4527.78 --> 4533.78
actually I really really did I wanted to

4531.62 --> 4535.04
be the good Jew I wanted to be the

4533.78 --> 4537.5
philosopher

4535.04 --> 4539.01
I even wanted to go a little bit into

4537.5 --> 4540.14
the stereotype

4539.01 --> 4541.76
[Music]

4540.14 --> 4544.46
I liked it

4541.76 --> 4547.1
I thought it was funny I thought that

4544.46 --> 4550.4
Jews were not boring

4547.1 --> 4552.7390000000005
yeah which is like a real thing for me

4550.4 --> 4553.879999999999
like wow this person is actually not

4552.739 --> 4555.32
boring

4553.88 --> 4558.9400000000005
damn

4555.32 --> 4558.94
that makes them interesting

4559.64 --> 4564.820000000001
so

4561.679 --> 4564.82
two threes

4565.28 --> 4568.0
what the

4568.58 --> 4575.44
so sick of Threes I'm sorry

4572.3 --> 4575.4400000000005
It's Gonna Come Back

4575.719 --> 4582.44
you're gonna get a three every

4578.659 --> 4585.4
ten numbers it's just gonna happen over

4582.44 --> 4588.62
and over and over again I mean

4585.4 --> 4590.599999999999
arguably one-tenth

4588.62 --> 4593.0599999999995
of all numbers

4590.6 --> 4596.38
has at least

4593.06 --> 4596.38
one three in it

4597.32 --> 4601.42
it's much more than that actually anyway

4612.32 --> 4619.159
the 33 is the most basic lie news code

4615.92 --> 4621.02
out there what

4619.159 --> 4624.86
why do you why

4621.02 --> 4626.540000000001
why price of atom why is it I have 33 in

4624.86 --> 4631.239
my email

4626.54 --> 4631.239
I got 33 in my show title right now

4632.06 --> 4636.219
why is it that

4636.679 --> 4640.12
according to you why

4640.94 --> 4646.5199999999995
33 is just a signal it's just a signal

4644.3 --> 4648.4400000000005
like hey

4646.52 --> 4651.02
there's some

4648.44 --> 4654.5
like more careful thinking going on here

4651.02 --> 4657.34
this is not just random [ __ ]

4654.5 --> 4660.679
right it's a code a code

4657.34 --> 4663.1990000000005
that's supposed to prove you have a

4660.679 --> 4666.1990000000005
certain level of grip that normal people

4663.199 --> 4668.86
tend not to have that's what it's a code

4666.199 --> 4668.86
for really

4669.98 --> 4675.98
33 is I think you're uh

4673.82 --> 4679.219
drawn conclusions that you do not even

4675.98 --> 4682.459999999999
have a hint of proof of where where is

4679.219 --> 4685.219
this proof of this communication

4682.46 --> 4687.8
have you ever like met a Freemason did

4685.219 --> 4691.58
you ever hear them out like hey

4687.8 --> 4694.04
I'm watch this movie there was a 33 what

4691.58 --> 4698.5599999999995
does that mean to you did they actually

4694.04 --> 4698.56
have a a detailed response

4698.96 --> 4703.06
33 is the end of your spine that's right

4703.64 --> 4708.08
it's the age of Jesus Christ's alleged

4706.46 --> 4711.14
death

4708.08 --> 4713.48
33 is a whole bunch of things it's also

4711.14 --> 4715.84
the amount of angels that fell down from

4713.48 --> 4715.839999999999
heaven

4717.5 --> 4724.94
33.

4719.84 --> 4727.400000000001
it's one-third right 33 is not just 33 a

4724.94 --> 4730.099999999999
number it's also a third it's very

4727.4 --> 4733.219
specifically a third

4730.1 --> 4734.96
if you split a hundred up

4733.219 --> 4737.56
in three parts

4734.96 --> 4740.84
and you round it down to whole numbers

4737.56 --> 4743.7390000000005
it will it you round it down or up to

4740.84 --> 4743.7390000000005
whole numbers right

4743.78 --> 4748.159
it's going to be 33. so it's not

4747.01 --> 4753.56
[Music]

4748.159 --> 4756.679
just a arbitrarily picked number

4753.56 --> 4758.360000000001
yeah that's why I said round it up

4756.679 --> 4759.9800000000005
or down

4758.36 --> 4762.88
Aries

4759.98 --> 4762.879999999999
that's the point

4764.6 --> 4770.92
besides there is no broken numbers don't

4768.02 --> 4770.92
actually exist

4792.32 --> 4794.44
thank you

4796.179 --> 4801.92
why I know how why where

4802.34 --> 4808.52
give me an example price of Adam give me

4805.4 --> 4810.679
a very direct example

4808.52 --> 4812.6
what's a broken number a broken number

4810.679 --> 4815.86
is a number

4812.6 --> 4815.860000000001
behind a comma

4820.46 --> 4829.4
any number that cannot be divided by one

4826.28 --> 4831.82
with a whole number turnout is a broken

4829.4 --> 4831.82
number

4848.06 --> 4855.17
not an integer I guess yeah

4851.96 --> 4855.17
[Music]

4860.3 --> 4865.58
number with a fractional part yeah

4862.34 --> 4869.2390000000005
that's not really a number that's math

4865.58 --> 4871.76
it's something you can do with math

4869.239 --> 4874.82
but that's not a whole do you understand

4871.76 --> 4877.219
like in numerology

4874.82 --> 4880.58
it doesn't mean anything

4877.219 --> 4884.54
it's there is it's ignored if there is a

4880.58 --> 4886.4
comma anywhere in any no it's ignored it

4884.54 --> 4890.0
doesn't matter

4886.4 --> 4893.12
like as you said non-integer

4890.0 --> 4896.739
numbers literally don't exist

4893.12 --> 4896.739
that's only in math

4901.52 --> 4904.159000000001
does pointing out

4903.08 --> 4909.139
two

4904.159 --> 4912.259999999999
hello price of atom I literally have 33

4909.139 --> 4917.3
in the email

4912.26 --> 4919.6
that I use for my show for my PayPal for

4917.3 --> 4919.6
everything

4920.6 --> 4926.54
and I have for quite a while it's really

4923.54 --> 4929.06
weird that you're just in my chat saying

4926.54 --> 4931.34
these things

4929.06 --> 4933.639
when I'm like literally shoving it in

4931.34 --> 4938.360000000001
everybody's face on purpose

4933.639 --> 4941.06
openly knowingly I claim it it's mine

4938.36 --> 4944.44

this from Adam don't just shove

5010.739 --> 5017.62
blatantly open conspiracy ideas without

5025.659 --> 5028.9
know what you're saying because you're

can you please

5031.06 --> 5035.4400000000005
make the points

5032.8 --> 5037.9800000000005
points a point where the hell are you

5035.44 --> 5037.98
getting this from

5039.639 --> 5044.9800000000005
and if you all got this from a video you

5042.88 --> 5049.5
recently watched then you might want to

5044.98 --> 5049.5
reconsider watching videos of that sort

5051.46 --> 5054.46
unless you actually had research for

5053.62 --> 5056.199
this

5054.46 --> 5058.62
unless you actually know what you're

5056.199 --> 5058.62
talking about

5060.4 --> 5065.86
I'm I'm trying to fight me

5063.4 --> 5067.9
well why don't you try why don't you

5065.86 --> 5069.94
actually try

5067.9 --> 5072.099999999999
aren't you actually try to make your

5069.94 --> 5074.739
point

5072.1 --> 5078.58
right share information

5074.739 --> 5083.339999999999
you brought up something PP is a code

5078.58 --> 5083.34
where the hell are you getting this from

5084.4 --> 5091.9
why don't you have a a burning urge to

5088.719 --> 5095.159
specifically inform me exactly where the

5091.9 --> 5095.159
hell you got this from

5102.58 --> 5106.859
foreign

[Music]

5113.199 --> 5117.339999999999

why would I ban him

5117.34 --> 5122.02
I just I'm just annoyed you're bringing

5120.219 --> 5125.199
something up saying oh this is that and

5122.02 --> 5128.620000000001
that and then just nothing nothing at

5125.199 --> 5130.719
all literally out of nowhere

5128.62 --> 5133.0
dude

5130.719 --> 5135.46
as far as I know what you just said

5133.0 --> 5138.94
could literally be completely made up

5135.46 --> 5141.76
horse [ __ ] and you don't even realize

5138.94 --> 5145.299999999999
that it is that okay it could literally

5141.76 --> 5148.12
be Satan having shot in your mouth and

5145.3 --> 5151.4800000000005
you think it's precious

5148.12 --> 5152.679
yeah that's why you need to know what

5151.48 --> 5155.138999999999
you're talking about when you're

5152.679 --> 5158.32
bringing on these things what is it

5155.139 --> 5160.54
where did you get this from what does it

5158.32 --> 5163.719
literally mean can you give us

5160.54 --> 5165.58
historical reference examples of exactly

5163.719 --> 5169.199
that

5165.58 --> 5169.199
on the top of your mind

5170.199 --> 5173.58
where are you getting this from

5184.36 --> 5187.199
what

5198.159 --> 5202.0599999999995
you're supposed to yeah that's what I

5200.38 --> 5204.6
would think but no it makes absolutely

5202.06 --> 5204.6
no sense

5205.84 --> 5210.6990000000005
letter Sage that that's why this is

5208.06 --> 5213.42
starting to annoy me like why do you

5210.699 --> 5213.419999999999
bring that up

5214.42 --> 5219.4
if you're gonna bring up like oh this

5216.4 --> 5221.379999999999
this is a thing then you better damn

5219.4 --> 5224.08
well back it up boy

5221.38 --> 5226.78
better damn well back it up

5224.08 --> 5230.199
another code yeah yeah you know what

5226.78 --> 5231.639
also is another code a a

5230.199 --> 5234.099999999999
or

5231.639 --> 5239.139
b b

5234.1 --> 5242.139
or SS or dude blah blah blah it doesn't

5239.139 --> 5244.719
mean [ __ ] because you literally cannot

5242.139 --> 5247.12
explain to me what the [ __ ] it means

5244.719 --> 5250.3
you're not seeing it you're literally

5247.12 --> 5253.36
not typing like a maniac in my chat

5250.3 --> 5256.659000000001
saying exactly what it is so you don't

5253.36 --> 5260.5599999999995
know you don't know what it means you

5256.659 --> 5263.199
heard somebody say PP is a code pp's and

5260.56 --> 5265.54
you literally absorb it you absorbed it

5263.199 --> 5266.62
without any context you don't know what

5265.54 --> 5270.0
it means

5266.62 --> 5270.0
why did you say that

5274.12 --> 5277.62
you don't know what it means

5283.62 --> 5289.239
okay yeah so yeah yeah the 33 dude they

5286.719 --> 5293.08
play oh yeah when it's

5289.239 --> 5296.138999999999
a numerical value in victims or in a

5293.08 --> 5299.639
time span yeah that is often a

5296.139 --> 5304.96
fabricated story I agree

5299.639 --> 5306.1
33 is indeed used in a weird way like

5304.96 --> 5308.02
that

5306.1 --> 5310.84
something is being reported that there

5308.02 --> 5313.96
are specifically 33 victims or it's

5310.84 --> 5315.159000000001
specifically an event that took like 33

5313.96 --> 5317.88
minutes

5315.159 --> 5321.46
or it happened in 33 seconds or anything

5317.88 --> 5323.38
oh this happens every 33 seconds yeah

5321.46 --> 5325.179
then it's like highly suspicious that

5323.38 --> 5329.26
there's anything real about it

5325.179 --> 5331.179
when it's used specifically like that

5329.26 --> 5333.52
I've noticed that too

5331.179 --> 5337.42
you don't really have to Google anything

5333.52 --> 5341.92
33 to do that

5337.42 --> 5344.32
yeah but this p p code

5341.92 --> 5345.82
never even heard what the [ __ ] that's

5344.32 --> 5348.94
about

5345.82 --> 5351.159
don't talk about people

5348.94 --> 5353.919999999999
really Fight Club

5351.159 --> 5355.839999999999
well he should dude if it's a Fight Club

5353.92 --> 5358.06
situation then why the [ __ ] would you

5355.84 --> 5360.34
bring it up in a public chat

5358.06 --> 5363.96
I mean Brad Pitt's gonna smack the [ __ ]

5360.34 --> 5363.96
out of you and he's not even real

5368.139 --> 5373.1990000000005
Peter Pan

5370.3 --> 5373.1990000000005
okay

5373.3 --> 5376.02
what

5382.98 --> 5388.08
33 is a signal a signal of what

5389.26 --> 5393.88
what's the signal

5391.0 --> 5399.12
E4 began

5393.88 --> 5399.12
what's the signal 33 33 is in my email

5400.9 --> 5404.5
all right

5402.04 --> 5406.12
yeah it's also in my current show title

5404.5 --> 5409.8
what's what's the signal what is the

5406.12 --> 5409.8
signal of 33 what does it mean

5410.44 --> 5414.96
to say shut up Aries 106.

5415.719 --> 5421.06
Gotta Go Party yeah all this PP talk I

5418.12 --> 5424.739
get it I'm sorry about that

5421.06 --> 5424.7390000000005
it's all Adam Price's fault

5431.44 --> 5439.659
okay so PP is [ __ ] from the Masons

5437.38 --> 5441.88
just like 33 that's what you're saying

5439.659 --> 5447.179
prize of Adam well I've never [ __ ]

5441.88 --> 5447.179
seen PP code before in anything

5448.36 --> 5454.54
you know what I see a lot more often

5450.36 --> 5458.139
really really ridiculous obviously made

5454.54 --> 5461.32
up gross Jew names that's what I do see

5458.139 --> 5465.46
a lot of it yeah it's standing out a lot

5461.32 --> 5468.54
more than any PP in names

5465.46 --> 5468.54
I mean come on

5468.58 --> 5472.36
have you even seen like these ridiculous

5470.679 --> 5475.2390000000005
crisis actor names

5472.36 --> 5477.46
yeah let's stay away from paper or screw

5475.239 --> 5480.36
you or an uncle Wombo donate to my

5477.46 --> 5480.36
PayPal right now

5490.6 --> 5495.0
I mean this is just pointless

5496.27 --> 5499.4490000000005
[Music]

5509.32 --> 5516.12
you can't be serious you cannot be

5513.04 --> 5516.12
serious prize of Adam

5517.78 --> 5520.5599999999995
really

5520.659 --> 5527.219
that's the evidence

5523.92 --> 5532.9
practice Panda Post open

5527.219 --> 5536.38
this is seriously price this is like

5532.9 --> 5538.839999999999
preschool [ __ ] this is bad

5536.38 --> 5542.92
if you actually believe that there's

5538.84 --> 5547.08
something seriously wrong with you

5542.92 --> 5547.08
this is really pathetic

5552.58 --> 5555.12
it's

5564.219 --> 5566.94
really

5569.26 --> 5573.639
you're a 33-0 congratulations I used to

5571.9 --> 5576.9
be 33 too

5573.639 --> 5576.900000000001
then I got older

5577.48 --> 5581.98
actually when I was 33 I probably had

5579.94 --> 5583.239
one of the most not worst experiences in

5581.98 --> 5586.659
my life

5583.239 --> 5589.48
or at least that I experienced as such

5586.659 --> 5590.98
it's the year where my ex-girlfriend

5589.48 --> 5594.58
broke up with me

5590.98 --> 5596.5
and I literally hallucinated

5594.58 --> 5598.0
got out of my mind

5596.5 --> 5600.159
because of that

5598.0 --> 5602.92
so whatever

5600.159 --> 5606.82
you could say I died spiritually that

5602.92 --> 5609.4800000000005
year what I was reborn took some time

5606.82 --> 5609.48
but it was

5610.9 --> 5615.94
I don't like talking about 33 oh well

5613.78 --> 5618.88
that's too bad

5615.94 --> 5621.28
maybe donate to my PayPal which also had

5618.88 --> 5622.78
PP in it and then I might stop talking

5621.28 --> 5625.0599999999995
about it

5622.78 --> 5627.639
because before that time I'm just gonna

5625.06 --> 5630.9400000000005
point out how absurd it is that you

5627.639 --> 5635.08
would just like start to obsess over

5630.94 --> 5637.719
just letters in Words I mean Jesus

5635.08 --> 5640.78
Christ does it come to this

5637.719 --> 5643.62
is that now the the thing you're doing

5640.78 --> 5643.62
come on

5644.92 --> 5650.639
like just this is like worse than

5648.04 --> 5650.639
numerology

5661.659 --> 5668.08
yeah oh you press event there you see

5663.94 --> 5669.339999999999
that three two two let's go yeah that's

5668.08 --> 5671.44
three

5669.34 --> 5676.900000000001
two two

5671.44 --> 5678.46
not three three it's also not p p what

5676.9 --> 5680.44
the [ __ ] does that have to do with

5678.46 --> 5682.0
anything yeah I know that's their code

5680.44 --> 5684.599999999999
what the hell does it have to do with

5682.0 --> 5684.6
anything else

5684.88 --> 5691.78
it's just don't you see Adam Price I'm

5688.96 --> 5695.44
serious like do you not see that this is

5691.78 --> 5697.84
just Folly you're engaging in fully

5695.44 --> 5699.879999999999
I mean this is like throwing Dice and

5697.84 --> 5702.88
then trying to predict the future here

5699.88 --> 5705.400000000001
stat level

5702.88 --> 5706.96
it's a different code man

5705.4 --> 5709.719
yeah

5706.96 --> 5712.06
why are you you don't know what it means

5709.719 --> 5716.02
why the [ __ ] would you even care

5712.06 --> 5718.619000000001
I'm just this is just

5716.02 --> 5718.619000000001
two

5721.36 --> 5725.619
stop doing that stay away from numbers

5724.179 --> 5729.159
and letters

5725.619 --> 5731.32
why didn't you go to the context

5729.159 --> 5732.699
yeah why don't you focus on context

5731.32 --> 5734.92
instead of

5732.699 --> 5737.5
getting away

5734.92 --> 5740.8
from contextual thinking and just like

5737.5 --> 5743.619
go to the little details oh the

5740.8 --> 5745.54
little decorations the decorations of

5743.619 --> 5748.299999999999
the language and the numbers like that

5745.54 --> 5750.4
is the context no it isn't now the

5748.3 --> 5753.28
context is right there for your spirit

5750.4 --> 5755.92
to pick up just like that just like that

5753.28 --> 5758.8
because it's there and God has delivered

5755.92 --> 5762.58
it to you through your spirit

5758.8 --> 5764.860000000001
context is right there numbers

5762.58 --> 5767.38
they're all a distraction they're a

5764.86 --> 5770.739
distraction away from the direct

5767.38 --> 5772.78
formless communication of God through

5770.739 --> 5774.58
information towards you

5772.78 --> 5777.639
in everything

5774.58 --> 5782.88
just don't look at the numbers don't

5777.639 --> 5782.88
look at the letters look at the context

5784.0 --> 5792.04
you only start to even look at anomalies

5787.54 --> 5794.08
or codes if they stand out to you what

5792.04 --> 5796.719
so if there's like a letter and there's

5794.08 --> 5798.699
somebody writes 33 in there

5796.719 --> 5802.42
or PP

5798.699 --> 5805.0
by the way having PP in a letter is

5802.42 --> 5807.159
yeah is not even that weird because you

5805.0 --> 5809.26
can have a PPS

5807.159 --> 5812.259999999999
post post scriptum

5809.26 --> 5814.4800000000005
so it's just like oh they had PPS at the

5812.26 --> 5816.76
end oh my God that's a secret code or

5814.48 --> 5820.48
they just had post post scripted it's

5816.76 --> 5823.84
just context context context is

5820.48 --> 5827.678999999999
everything numbers is nothing context is

5823.84 --> 5829.5
everything numbers is nothing nothing at

5827.679 --> 5833.679
all

5829.5 --> 5837.719
virtual not anything context is

5833.679 --> 5837.719
everything numbers are nothing

5849.639 --> 5853.84
I remember the truth and I didn't know

5851.56 --> 5855.9400000000005
about the codes oh well have you ever

5853.84 --> 5857.38
met a truth or that actually had a point

5855.94 --> 5860.138999999999
about it

5857.38 --> 5863.58
or you only know truthers that just

5860.139 --> 5866.4400000000005
ramble and ramble and Ramble On

5863.58 --> 5868.96
incessantly about oh the code in this

5866.44 --> 5872.08
all the code in that oh Illuminati oh

5868.96 --> 5874.179
shill oh Freemason did they have a point

5872.08 --> 5878.619
did they actually have a point or did

5874.179 --> 5882.54
they just Ramble On continually

5878.619 --> 5884.98
pointing out stupid [ __ ] drawing in

5882.54 --> 5887.619
conspiratorial claims without actual

5884.98 --> 5889.239
investigation yeah

5887.619 --> 5892.679
because there's a lot of that out there

5889.239 --> 5892.678999999999
and it's super annoying

5908.26 --> 5914.08
there were many years I spent

5910.719 --> 5916.179
researching this why why did you spend

5914.08 --> 5918.04
years researching it

5916.179 --> 5920.8
I mean

5918.04 --> 5923.86
in all fairness any research concerning

5920.8 --> 5925.2390000000005
like numbers should be over in just a

5923.86 --> 5927.28
few months

5925.239 --> 5930.099999999999
when you figure out like oh yeah they're

5927.28 --> 5932.5599999999995
everywhere oh yeah this is how it works

5930.1 --> 5936.6990000000005
and what you're gonna then just

5932.56 --> 5938.139
go through all books in libraries to

5936.699 --> 5940.119
find more

5938.139 --> 5945.36
why

5940.119 --> 5945.36
why would you waste all that time on it

5949.179 --> 5957.28
but has it actually delivered

5952.96 --> 5959.88
what has focus on 33 or PP in this case

5957.28 --> 5963.84
what has it actually yield it for you

5959.88 --> 5966.52
how have you become wiser more capable

5963.84 --> 5969.159000000001
more insightful

5966.52 --> 5970.4800000000005
more constructive because of knowledge

5969.159 --> 5971.98
about that

5970.48 --> 5974.86
lay it down

5971.98 --> 5977.5
this is a direct challenge price of Adam

5974.86 --> 5981.599999999999
tell me

5977.5 --> 5985.84
how has your study in these codes

5981.6 --> 5988.08
literally improved your life how be

5985.84 --> 5988.08
honest

5988.719 --> 5992.92
if the answer is anything other than

5990.76 --> 5995.88
just busying therapy

5992.92 --> 5995.88
I'd like to know

6019.8 --> 6025.639
hey steamy Trevor

6023.04 --> 6025.639
what

6028.56 --> 6034.52
when I see news I know pretty well when

6032.1 --> 6034.52
it's War

6036.659 --> 6042.42
right

6039.06 --> 6045.3
but how did that allege how did that

6042.42 --> 6046.86
demand that you spent several years

6045.3 --> 6049.38
studying this when you could have

6046.86 --> 6051.0
figured that out in just two months as

6049.38 --> 6053.46
did I

6051.0 --> 6055.679
much younger I knew there was something

6053.46 --> 6058.7390000000005
there first I was scared and then I

6055.679 --> 6061.08
realized wait it's not that at all

6058.739 --> 6063.0599999999995
don't have to fear that

6061.08 --> 6065.04
and I've gotten to the point where I

6063.06 --> 6068.820000000001
literally claim it like yeah this is

6065.04 --> 6071.5199999999995
mine I claim it I personally claim it

6068.82 --> 6074.82
it's mine now

6071.52 --> 6078.0
nobody will incite fear

6074.82 --> 6080.099999999999
in me about it again I claim it it's

6078.0 --> 6082.139
mine now

6080.1 --> 6084.119000000001
you understand what that means you

6082.139 --> 6085.5
probably don't some of you are watching

6084.119 --> 6087.719
this might

6085.5 --> 6090.659
I claim it it's mine

6087.719 --> 6094.32
yeah it's not yours anymore it's not

6090.659 --> 6096.719
your secret group it's not Satan's no I

6094.32 --> 6100.199
claim it it's mine now

6096.719 --> 6104.179
my spirit will dwell there

6100.199 --> 6104.178999999999
and it will do what it does

6109.76 --> 6113.6990000000005
[Music]

6111.179 --> 6116.28
and if that's not convenient to any

6113.699 --> 6119.36
system out there that's utilizing well

6116.28 --> 6119.36
too bad for you

6137.1 --> 6141.780000000001
never thought that about me well good

6139.5 --> 6144.6
well that means that you got the context

6141.78 --> 6149.9
then right because context means

6144.6 --> 6149.900000000001
everything numbers mean nothing

6153.659 --> 6158.879999999999
that's why I put it right there right

6156.54 --> 6161.58
there in everybody's face I do it on

6158.88 --> 6164.159000000001
purpose you see I show it

6161.58 --> 6167.54
to see that the numbers don't actually

6164.159 --> 6167.54
have power over us

6169.86 --> 6173.0
I'm not afraid

6193.199 --> 6197.36
that's right Jim West numbers can mean

6195.179 --> 6197.36
anything

6198.56 --> 6204.26
let's see huh yes there's a live show

6201.06 --> 6204.26
today on fpd great

6206.58 --> 6209.0
good

6214.02 --> 6217.02
ah

6221.28 --> 6227.94
right so yeah I'm not angry at anybody I

6224.82 --> 6229.92
just it's this habit this habit number

6227.94 --> 6232.138999999999
addiction

6229.92 --> 6235.56
because it's a distraction it's like

6232.139 --> 6238.32
somebody just it's like being a kid

6235.56 --> 6240.900000000001
sitting in your Game Boy during like a

6238.32 --> 6243.42
family visit and your parents like hello

6240.9 --> 6246.0599999999995
could you put the freaking Game Boy down

6243.42 --> 6248.52
there's family here stop being so

6246.06 --> 6250.4400000000005
anti-social yeah

6248.52 --> 6252.4800000000005
oh that's what I'm doing here when

6250.44 --> 6254.638999999999
people say oh the codes and the numbers

6252.48 --> 6257.04
and oh that's what I'm gonna look for no

6254.639 --> 6261.719
it's a [ __ ] waste of time

6257.04 --> 6264.119
that's your conspiracy Game Boy put the

6261.719 --> 6267.44
conspiracy Game Boy down and stop

6264.119 --> 6267.44
wasting everybody's time

6267.48 --> 6275.0
go to context context means everything

6271.139 --> 6275.0
numbers mean nothing

6285.84 --> 6294.2390000000005
yeah a 33 in anything doesn't mean

6290.34 --> 6296.639
anything unless there is a context that

6294.239 --> 6299.659
would make it highlight

6296.639 --> 6303.179
like a diode getting electrified

6299.659 --> 6306.719
suddenly it starts burning yeah 33 is

6303.179 --> 6310.4400000000005
like a diode in a message if there's no

6306.719 --> 6312.6
lie then it won't stand out as much it

6310.44 --> 6314.58
will just be a number

6312.6 --> 6317.1
now if there is

6314.58 --> 6320.159
a hint that there might be fakery going

6317.1 --> 6323.04
on or an exaggeration then suddenly the

6320.159 --> 6326.839999999999
number 33 in the message is a hinter

6323.04 --> 6326.84
it's like a diode lighting up

6326.94 --> 6333.78
this is probably fake yeah

6331.139 --> 6336.36
context

6333.78 --> 6338.9
without context numbers don't mean

6336.36 --> 6338.9
anything

6344.639 --> 6349.86
that would be by the way so much better

6346.8 --> 6351.84
title than what I got now

6349.86 --> 6354.0199999999995
numbers mean nothing context means

6351.84 --> 6354.02
everything

6356.46 --> 6361.46
should I change the title or should I

6358.679 --> 6361.46
save it for tomorrow

6377.1 --> 6379.6990000000005
okay

6394.619 --> 6397.619
okay

6398.76 --> 6403.5
foreign

6400.5 --> 6405.42
thank you for the uh the jokes this

6403.5 --> 6407.639
thing might be getting a

6405.42 --> 6410.1
I might be literally by accident

6407.639 --> 6411.719
starting to break a bunch of autistic

6410.1 --> 6414.780000000001
people

6411.719 --> 6417.6
that just made it their life work to to

6414.78 --> 6419.099999999999
obsess over this

6417.6 --> 6420.54
I guarantee you it's

6419.1 --> 6423.4800000000005
[Music]

6420.54 --> 6426.659
it's not worth all that time you're not

6423.48 --> 6430.678999999999
gonna solve a puzzle by obsessing over

6426.659 --> 6433.44
numbers you will not

6430.679 --> 6435.3
because without a context it doesn't

6433.44 --> 6437.5199999999995
mean anything it's just secondary

6435.3 --> 6439.37
numbers are secondary without the

6437.52 --> 6442.47
context it doesn't mean anything

6439.37 --> 6442.47
[Music]

6463.619 --> 6468.0199999999995
yeah I already named all of that Scott

6480.96 --> 6486.44
that's where you think it comes from

6482.699 --> 6486.44
well what about Christ's age

6487.02 --> 6491.52
dude there's 33 in everything it's a

6489.84 --> 6494.28
third of a hundred

6491.52 --> 6497.34
being 10 times 10.

6494.28 --> 6500.28
yeah so

6497.34 --> 6502.860000000001
it's just a pattern it's just a very

6500.28 --> 6505.8
standard reoccurring pattern it's a it's

6502.86 --> 6508.639
a critical reoccurring number

6505.8 --> 6508.639
that is it

6516.179 --> 6520.28
what does context without numbers mean

6521.4 --> 6524.0
language

6543.42 --> 6549.179
God this show is freaking messy guys

6547.44 --> 6551.58
don't know what the hell's up with you

6549.179 --> 6555.119
why are you all no morality squirting

6551.58 --> 6558.8
this is just embarrassing to me

6555.119 --> 6558.799999999999
all should know better than that

6565.679 --> 6571.56
crypto Jewish something pretending not

6568.139 --> 6575.2390000000005
to be a Jew okay

6571.56 --> 6575.2390000000005
yeah [ __ ] off Scott

6585.78 --> 6591.54
I like cryptoju much more

6589.44 --> 6594.0599999999995
if it's

6591.54 --> 6595.86
I mean if it's crypto then it's not oh

6594.06 --> 6599.04
they're pretending not no they're that's

6595.86 --> 6600.719
just called being Undercover

6599.04 --> 6604.26
let's pretend

6600.719 --> 6607.02
no crypto is encryption it means there's

6604.26 --> 6609.4800000000005
something hidden I like my form of

6607.02 --> 6612.659000000001
crypto Jew better a Jew that doesn't

6609.48 --> 6614.879999999999
actually know that they're a Jew

6612.659 --> 6617.098999999999
not that they're hiding it I mean all of

6614.88 --> 6618.659000000001
them do that all the time whenever it's

6617.099 --> 6620.6990000000005
convenient right oh suddenly they're

6618.659 --> 6622.619
white oh no they're a Jew again oh no

6620.699 --> 6623.759999999999
they're white oh they do that all the

6622.619 --> 6625.679
time

6623.76 --> 6629.099
it's about

6625.679 --> 6632.04
the Amnesia perhaps and them not

6629.099 --> 6637.219
realizing that they are a Jew that's a

6632.04 --> 6637.219
crypto Jew now because I say so

6641.639 --> 6646.08
any other form of crypto Jew meaning is

6644.28 --> 6649.259999999999
just completely pointless because

6646.08 --> 6651.179
they're all that then they all lie about

6649.26 --> 6653.34
what they are

6651.179 --> 6656.659
the point is about them not knowing it

6653.34 --> 6656.659000000001
that's what makes it crypto

6658.08 --> 6664.679
right hidden hidden from themselves I I

6662.159 --> 6667.199
decree it

6664.679 --> 6671.4800000000005
screw you if you disagree

6667.199 --> 6671.48
are there crypto flat earthers

6672.86 --> 6679.28
yeah arguably

6676.38 --> 6679.28
but yeah

6679.98 --> 6684.78
we usually just call that secret Flat

6682.44 --> 6686.879999999999
Earth there's people that sympathize

6684.78 --> 6689.36
with flat Earth but try to keep it under

6686.88 --> 6689.36
wraps

6690.3 --> 6694.26
because they're kind of like ashamed of

6692.58 --> 6695.58
it or they're scared they're gonna get

6694.26 --> 6697.9800000000005
ostracized

6695.58 --> 6700.739
but that's not crypto though

6697.98 --> 6703.82
that's just covert

6700.739 --> 6703.82
that's Undercover

6704.219 --> 6706.639
Secret

6706.92 --> 6713.88
the crypto flatter through

6710.099 --> 6716.28
is technically impossible in my in my

6713.88 --> 6718.1990000000005
Approach because you can never just be a

6716.28 --> 6719.219
flat earther and think you're not a flat

6718.199 --> 6722.159
earther

6719.219 --> 6724.46
that makes no sense because what makes a

6722.159 --> 6727.44
flat earther or a baller is literally

6724.46 --> 6729.119
the train or thinking and the arguments

6727.44 --> 6732.0599999999995
that are going to come out of you the

6729.119 --> 6734.94
context is what makes you it

6732.06 --> 6736.92
you can't roll out the context and then

6734.94 --> 6739.0199999999995
think you're something else if that were

6736.92 --> 6741.54
the case then you're just cuckoo

6739.02 --> 6744.06
you absolutely have are psychotic then

6741.54 --> 6746.82
you're like oh I'm rolling out Flat

6744.06 --> 6751.04
Earth arguments literally like the full

6746.82 --> 6751.04
train the black the Black Swan

6751.08 --> 6755.94
right

6752.42 --> 6758.219
elevation angle all that and then say

6755.94 --> 6760.44
like yeah I'm defending the ball

6758.219 --> 6761.76
that just makes no sense that's just

6760.44 --> 6764.28
psychotic then

6761.76 --> 6766.9800000000005
so it's impossible you cannot be a

6764.28 --> 6768.84
crypto flat earther

6766.98 --> 6771.739
because the information literally

6768.84 --> 6771.7390000000005
reveals it

6772.38 --> 6777.78
right

6773.46 --> 6779.82
oh you could be a Jew and not realize or

6777.78 --> 6781.619
have forgotten that you are one and then

6779.82 --> 6783.599
you would be a crypto Jew it's like yeah

6781.619 --> 6787.04
he's a Jew but he just doesn't know it

6783.599 --> 6787.04
or doesn't know it anymore

6791.9 --> 6795.598999999999
Flat Earth is masquerading as globers

6794.219 --> 6796.8
not sure what the benefit would be yeah

6795.599 --> 6800.599
no [ __ ]

6796.8 --> 6800.599
it would just be totally insane

6804.84 --> 6809.639
because like yeah you would be rolling

6807.9 --> 6811.92
on Flat Earth arguments thinking you're

6809.639 --> 6813.4800000000005
defending the glow well it's not it's

6811.92 --> 6816.179
just not going to be compatible people

6813.48 --> 6821.04
will just think you're crazy

6816.179 --> 6824.2390000000005
anyway this is a really weird show is it

6821.04 --> 6827.699
right but I'm gonna round it out

6824.239 --> 6829.0199999999995
interesting weird little agitated here

6827.699 --> 6831.598999999999
and there perhaps

6829.02 --> 6833.400000000001
see I didn't ban anybody I didn't ban

6831.599 --> 6835.4400000000005
Adam Price

6833.4 --> 6836.94
you don't have to worry

6835.44 --> 6838.919999999999
just because I think you're doing

6836.94 --> 6841.0199999999995
something stupid

6838.92 --> 6844.92
that I'm just gonna kick you that no you

6841.02 --> 6847.8
have to actually be genuinely offensive

6844.92 --> 6849.3
you have to break the social order code

6847.8 --> 6851.28
to do that

6849.3 --> 6854.46
sure tomorrow

6851.28 --> 6857.759999999999
I hope so if it's not as freaking hot

6854.46 --> 6860.46
anymore then I'll put it back on

6857.76 --> 6863.219
yesterday I was with the sure too but it

6860.46 --> 6865.02
was cooler then that's oh it is cooling

6863.219 --> 6867.54
up a bit so

6865.02 --> 6871.5
we'll see

6867.54 --> 6873.719
right anyway thanks everyone for coming
