yeah sure yeah anyway I didn't

246.86 --> 252.38000000000002
definitely didn't want to talk this

249.41 --> 256.90999999999997
today about just that you know it's just

252.38 --> 259.73
that yeah every Sunday I'm used to like

256.91 --> 261.56
waking up looking outside and seeing the

259.73 --> 264.92
parking lot filled with cars over there

261.56 --> 267.58
and now it wasn't and I can only figure

264.92 --> 269.53000000000003
out one reason why didn't why it wasn't

267.58 --> 275.46999999999997
at this date

269.53 --> 275.46999999999997
hey the Me's King in George Sanford

280.48 --> 290.38
right it is interesting though to see

286.21 --> 294.43
like how different political figures are

290.38 --> 297.56
basically reacting to this and

294.43 --> 304.24
apparently today or yesterday somewhere

297.56 --> 307.94
I don't know exactly when right yeah

304.24 --> 311.24
Russian Russian region it's more to the

307.94 --> 315.02
east so it it should be kind of evening

311.24 --> 317.45
there I think maybe or in the late

315.02 --> 321.49
afternoon but anyway there was this

317.45 --> 325.96999999999997
article on RT that the Chechen leader

321.49 --> 329.33
whose yeah who's Muslim he's basically

325.97 --> 333.14000000000004
saying to like yet like stop stop

329.33 --> 334.84999999999997
panicking the flu is is it's just as

333.14 --> 337.71999999999997
dangerous and we have traditional

334.85 --> 340.55
medicines against it so he recommends

337.72 --> 344.78000000000003
vitamin C as in lemons with water and

340.55 --> 347.33
honey yes traditional you even use warm

344.78 --> 349.4
water actually that that's what I use I

347.33 --> 353.26
didn't like it though but it did work

349.4 --> 356.57
and garlic so that's like super base

353.26 --> 360.2
super based it's always good to hear

356.57 --> 362.18
another world leader somewhere another

360.2 --> 365.26
leader somewhere have just kind of

362.18 --> 365.26
keeping it simple

370.529 --> 381.629
Wow right anyway that's pretty much

378.089 --> 394.849
about that what did I watch yesterday a

381.629 --> 399.269
lot a lot of things yeah yeah I know

394.849 --> 404.429
yeah I don't want you around the other

399.269 --> 407.749
client you can go - don't come back for

404.429 --> 407.74899999999997
a while as I said yesterday

413.13 --> 416.23
[Music]

417.1 --> 426.1
yeah Chechen well I it's just the world

421.96 --> 428.28
leader I know it's not really literal I

426.1 --> 431.32000000000005
just say among the leaders in the world

428.28 --> 433.84
it's not literally leader of the world

431.32 --> 437.37
it's like leader in the world rather it

433.84 --> 439.98999999999995
did sorry about that don't don't I'm not

437.37 --> 443.88
doing anything with that I just thought

439.99 --> 443.88
it was that it was awesome what he said

446.52 --> 466.18
don't get all politicize on me is baking

456.55 --> 468.75
soda and water good I I don't know for

466.18 --> 472.21
sure I think that using baking soda is

468.75 --> 475.68
in general kind of good for the body so

472.21 --> 475.68
I don't see any harm in it

476.73 --> 484.06
at least it might yeah just give your

481.96 --> 487.75
body just a little extra nudge in the

484.06 --> 489.91
good direction and maybe added help a

487.75 --> 495.76
little like that I don't know I don't

489.91 --> 498.19
know any direct yeah relation between

495.76 --> 500.65
viruses and baking soda what I know

498.19 --> 505.03
baking soda for mostly is detoxifying

500.65 --> 508.47999999999996
and especially getting rid of cancer

505.03 --> 512.3199999999999
through the what is it Candida that's

508.48 --> 515.64
what it it helps most for so yeah an

512.32 --> 520.7700000000001
indirect sense it'll probably help but

515.64 --> 520.77
yeah it's no remedy

521.499 --> 526.129
all right you're an opt-out I don't know

524.209 --> 527.8389999999999
is it jumpy is anybody else having

526.129 --> 530.66
trouble I don't seem to have trouble

527.839 --> 533.4100000000001
with my connection um what I my feedback

530.66 --> 533.41
on YouTube

547.389 --> 551.67

watching a lot of stuff yesterday

582.939 --> 602.509
hey ba McCloud gain a fish oh yeah David

593.36 --> 605.6
wise on what was it again

602.509 --> 606.92
he played something yeah oh man I did I

605.6 --> 612.2900000000001
did see that

606.92 --> 617.74
what is it the the skit from from

612.29 --> 617.74
mountain bear oh god it was so good

617.949 --> 631.2489999999999
Down syndrome president yeah that that

621.589 --> 633.139
thing was just it was really special but

631.249 --> 636.049
yeah I bet all of you have seen that by

633.139 --> 638.899
now I own Benjamin showed it plenty of

636.049 --> 644.6
times and yeah the videos out there it

638.899 --> 647.74
is really awesome it's just it's just a

644.6 --> 647.74
fascinating concept

654.06 --> 660.0899999999999
I'm and a young I think they like Ohio

657.03 --> 670.92
was insulted that you left him out of

660.09 --> 673.77
your initial great spree been chilling

670.92 --> 679.16
staying away from Asian broads really

673.77 --> 679.16
yes that is so mean

686.08 --> 700.4200000000001
no come on Bates don't do that

692.35 --> 704.47
but yeah the yeah that D livestream with

700.42 --> 708.5899999999999
with David wise was pretty good and

704.47 --> 711.0500000000001
again it's still so fast I was doing my

708.59 --> 713.36
thing again and this time I was able to

711.05 --> 717.89
I didn't get timed out or anything so I

713.36 --> 720.77
guess it was okay but I was on like hey

717.89 --> 722.98
hey what is the geometrical orientation

720.77 --> 725.96
of the Equator do you know is it a

722.98 --> 728.66
literal physical literal geometrical

725.96 --> 731.35
circle so it's a straight line what is

728.66 --> 734.0
it because yeah this ice wall

731.35 --> 736.3100000000001
surrounding us is correct that's like

734.0 --> 739.13
presupposition I was being a pain in the

736.31 --> 742.31
ass in a technical sense but somebody

739.13 --> 743.24
needs to do it you know I got it it's

742.31 --> 746.54
what I do

743.24 --> 748.82
and I try not to be a jerk about it when

746.54 --> 752.99
I do especially with people that I do

748.82 --> 757.25
respect like David wise and like own

752.99 --> 759.86
Benjamin but I just I just want people

757.25 --> 763.76
to think about that like really are you

759.86 --> 766.73
sure this is not another presupposition

763.76 --> 768.29
and yeah I'm just poking about that

766.73 --> 772.16
because if you're gonna speculate about

768.29 --> 773.66
what supposedly beyond you know there

772.16 --> 775.8199999999999
they were on like you know what is

773.66 --> 777.23
beyond the entire why is it such a high

775.82 --> 781.7
landmass what could that be

777.23 --> 786.0500000000001
and Babel all that and I was like hey

781.7 --> 787.5200000000001
hello what's beyond the north are you

786.05 --> 791.4799999999999
assume there's literally nothing there

787.52 --> 792.86
what about like the the old maps where

791.48 --> 795.589
they're supposedly an island they're

792.86 --> 798.28
like oh that's just nothing good no to

795.589 --> 801.47
the north no that's that's the center

798.28 --> 804.8299999999999
really is it is it really though you

801.47 --> 808.07
know it is the map literal is that a

804.83 --> 811.57
literal disk or is it a projection a

808.07 --> 811.57
disk based projection

811.97 --> 820.2900000000001
so yeah I was just being it myself there

817.32 --> 823.7700000000001
and it was good to do that because there

820.29 --> 825.9
was a lot of attention also there was a

823.77 --> 827.85
lot of gravy in the stream I had a lot

825.9 --> 833.31
of fun I felt that I was allowed to do

827.85 --> 839.88
that and yeah it was great it felt

833.31 --> 842.67
really good other things watched man

839.88 --> 845.16
there was so much it's it's hard to just

842.67 --> 847.92
keep track of it all and unfortunately

845.16 --> 850.0799999999999
it's not all in YouTube or unfortunately

847.92 --> 852.51
it's just that YouTube at least allows

850.08 --> 855.26
me to keep sort of track of it D life

852.51 --> 855.26
doesn't

860.43 --> 867.41
was it

863.24 --> 871.1
oh yeah I cut tenth man faking another

867.41 --> 877.249
cooking video it seems like that's his

871.1 --> 880.0690000000001
new thing he's making cooking videos but

877.249 --> 882.11
yeah he leaves out actual empirical

880.069 --> 885.439
evidence that he did any of the cooking

882.11 --> 887.9590000000001
it's very interesting so I suspected

885.439 --> 889.79
with certain meals he makes his wife do

887.959 --> 891.92
it and with other he just buys it in the

889.79 --> 894.439
store and pretends that he's doing it

891.92 --> 898.04
because there is no empirical evidence

894.439 --> 901.279
in his videos that he actually does the

898.04 --> 903.309
preparation have you taken notice of

901.279 --> 903.309
that

909.89 --> 912.67
nobody

916.79 --> 924.4989999999999
alright anyway moving on

921.19 --> 924.499
[Music]

926.16 --> 939.14
oh yeah I watch some Netflix you agree

930.54 --> 939.14
what servants you do alright

941.66 --> 949.73
it is kinda silly though you don't watch

947.339 --> 952.4100000000001
cooking shows unless Ramsay is in it

949.73 --> 955.5500000000001
yeah you know a good cooking video does

952.41 --> 959.6999999999999
need a lot of verbal abuse and all that

955.55 --> 961.8499999999999
you know the best cooking is passion in

959.7 --> 961.85
it

971.97 --> 975.09
[Music]

979.889 --> 987.54
you do good servant daddy that would

985.709 --> 990.1189999999999
truly be one of the silliest things ever

987.54 --> 991.9989999999999
because I was for those who haven't

990.119 --> 995.97
caught on I was just joking

991.999 --> 1001.129
but technically yeah the it did kind of

995.97 --> 1003.679
notice like wow he he just shows kinda

1001.129 --> 1006.379
finished in betweens to make the the

1003.679 --> 1008.689
perfect food picture rather than

1006.379 --> 1012.889
actually doing the cooking and it's

1008.689 --> 1013.8499999999999
something like hmm you could if you were

1012.889 --> 1016.929
a bit of a dick

1013.85 --> 1020.6890000000001
interpret that a bit like a so funny and

1016.929 --> 1025.429
needlessly think there's a conspiracy

1020.689 --> 1027.769
for him to actually not cook but yeah it

1025.429 --> 1029.63
is hilarious I think I don't know we'll

1027.769 --> 1033.409
see where it goes maybe he will actually

1029.63 --> 1036.709
adapt and just show the actual cooking

1033.409 --> 1039.019
or maybe not I don't know man maybe his

1036.709 --> 1042.549
wife is actually doing the cooking you

1039.019 --> 1042.549
know it could be

1048.88 --> 1059.5
I didn't notice any engagement ring good

1051.22 --> 1071.1100000000001
servant anyway it's just it's silly it's

1059.5 --> 1075.4
all silly yeah big diamond what are you

1071.11 --> 1077.29
sure it's a diamond doesn't match that

1075.4 --> 1083.8000000000002
yeah doesn't actually have to be a

1077.29 --> 1087.97
diamond CGI CDI ring oh dear I don't

1083.8 --> 1090.7
know if 10th man could do that that's

1087.97 --> 1092.74
some sophisticated CGI technology in

1090.7 --> 1095.74
order to basically manifest things like

1092.74 --> 1098.47
rings you know NASA has it we know that

1095.74 --> 1102.19
with the with the floating mics and all

1098.47 --> 1106.48
that [ __ ] and and even using that it's

1102.19 --> 1108.8200000000002
so difficult so I don't think 10th man

1106.48 --> 1112.93
has like a proper CGI guy behind him

1108.82 --> 1116.1399999999999
that could fake that unless it is a big

1112.93 --> 1118.38
secret project that is slowly building

1116.14 --> 1123.3300000000002
up to something hmm

1118.38 --> 1123.3300000000002
I'm keeping my eye on you tenth man

1132.49 --> 1136.819
[Music]

1143.64 --> 1157.48
anyway right yeah I also watched some

1149.49 --> 1162.27
some Netflix Netflix oh god I continued

1157.48 --> 1162.27
watching I think it was the latest

1162.87 --> 1169.12
Mission Impossible movie because I

1166.72 --> 1170.56
thought like oh this is probably one

1169.12 --> 1172.09
I've seen already and then I watched it

1170.56 --> 1174.94
and it's like hmm I don't really

1172.09 --> 1176.98
recognize this then again with some of

1174.94 --> 1179.14
the previous movies that happened to

1176.98 --> 1181.9
that I watched them for like the second

1179.14 --> 1184.1200000000001
time and was like wait what I don't

1181.9 --> 1185.8000000000002
remember this hmm I remember that but

1184.12 --> 1188.32
that could be from the trailer did I

1185.8 --> 1191.83
actually see this so I but I think I

1188.32 --> 1193.5
definitely did not see it and when I

1191.83 --> 1197.08
walked through it

1193.5 --> 1197.76
yeah it was special it was very special

1197.08 --> 1202.09
all right

1197.76 --> 1205.6
it was a giant it was an exciting movie

1202.09 --> 1208.3899999999999
as a movie but as the story technicals

1205.6 --> 1210.49
and the things that were the plot that

1208.39 --> 1213.5800000000002
was like the biggest presuppositional

1210.49 --> 1217.57
[ __ ] fest I've ever seen this was

1213.58 --> 1221.8899999999999
ridiculous like that the notion of what

1217.57 --> 1223.75
secret agencies do and like the IMF or

1221.89 --> 1226.3600000000001
that was there from the start but it's

1223.75 --> 1228.19
just shine it's more blatant now with

1226.36 --> 1232.77
what we know about the world in or in

1228.19 --> 1236.23
reality it's just wow and unlike the

1232.77 --> 1239.53
glorification of the reasons and of

1236.23 --> 1244.5
course the plutonium cores and nuclear

1239.53 --> 1244.5
bombs and it it it's just

1249.39 --> 1256.1100000000001
but it was as a movie as just if you

1252.72 --> 1258.24
like try to drop the knowledge for a

1256.11 --> 1261.03
while and just go with like yeah this is

1258.24 --> 1264.48
like a like GI Joe for example you know

1261.03 --> 1267.99
even back then when I was a kid and I

1264.48 --> 1270.059
watched you good hero it was just so

1267.99 --> 1273.95
obvious that it was absolutely not

1270.059 --> 1276.24
reflecting reality and like even

1273.95 --> 1278.8500000000001
Americans back dad would say yeah yeah

1276.24 --> 1282.27
it's it's kids into it this is not real

1278.85 --> 1286.7099999999998
this is not real I kind of knew that you

1282.27 --> 1289.11
know and if you just know that then you

1286.71 --> 1291.24
can still sort of enjoy it and I feel

1289.11 --> 1294.8999999999999
the same way about this you know it's it

1291.24 --> 1298.7
is very propagandized with the secret

1294.9 --> 1303.72
cabal propaganda presuppositions dispels

1298.7 --> 1305.94
viruses spells viral loop but yeah as a

1303.72 --> 1309.72
movie it was still good it was a good

1305.94 --> 1316.8600000000001
action movie very thrilling scenes very

1309.72 --> 1319.38
cool very beautiful scenery so yeah it

1316.86 --> 1322.7099999999998
was a good movie despite all the silly

1319.38 --> 1324.8700000000001
storylines and I will definitely watch

1322.71 --> 1333.08
it again and enjoy it again so yeah that

1324.87 --> 1333.08
just stance you know it's like yeah

1334.08 --> 1343.99
it just it balances out good enough I

1340.6 --> 1346.779
watched that and I also before that I

1343.99 --> 1350.049
kind of watch I tried like a new series

1346.779 --> 1352.99
and I thought like yeah okay this sounds

1350.049 --> 1360.75
interesting it says spiritual right and

1352.99 --> 1365.76
start watching it Jesus oh my god ah ah

1360.75 --> 1370.96
ah yeah I watched the series called

1365.76 --> 1373.87
sense 8 and I got through the entire

1370.96 --> 1376.5900000000001
first episode oh yeah thanks for the

1373.87 --> 1385.389
chat reminder fix that

1376.59 --> 1389.6789999999999
but dear Lord that doubt that dad was

1385.389 --> 1392.86
like the ultimate yeah I didn't realize

1389.679 --> 1399.039
that when I started watching it Denis

1392.86 --> 1404.1689999999999
Kang oh my god that was gay was like

1399.039 --> 1408.669
mega ultra LGBT like the most extreme

1404.169 --> 1410.98
I've ever seen it was like those crazy

1408.669 --> 1412.8990000000001
scenes that Alex Jones like to flip

1410.98 --> 1413.799
around the crazy social justice warriors

1412.899 --> 1416.9799999999998
flipping out

1413.799 --> 1419.49
well that but just one little step back

1416.98 --> 1421.8990000000001
when they're not extremely triggered and

1419.49 --> 1432.6
then just imagine those people you've

1421.899 --> 1435.6689999999999
seen there that's this series so yeah a

1432.6 --> 1440.5
bit of trouble getting through that this

1435.669 --> 1446.5900000000001
oh my god so I don't think I'll be

1440.5 --> 1449.5
watching that entire series what yeah

1446.59 --> 1455.5
and the other hand it it is I can't help

1449.5 --> 1458.38
but still kind of do the suspense of

1455.5 --> 1460.74
disbelief thing and think I was trying

1458.38 --> 1463.48
to kind of just to get through it away

1460.74 --> 1466.73
trying to get back in the mindset that I

1463.48 --> 1470.54
used to have when I was still

1466.73 --> 1473.42
okay sir checker when I was still like

1470.54 --> 1476.24
pretty indoctrinated oh oh thank you

1473.42 --> 1478.01
menu when I was still very much leftist

1476.24 --> 1481.19
believer and a thought like yeah there's

1478.01 --> 1482.93
nothing wrong with gay and and not

1481.19 --> 1486.38
saying that there is something wrong

1482.93 --> 1492.5900000000001
with gay right let's not let's not

1486.38 --> 1494.6000000000001
mistake that it's just that it's you

1492.59 --> 1496.4299999999998
can't just think that it is something

1494.6 --> 1498.1699999999998
that has no consequences what do you

1496.43 --> 1504.3700000000001
think it's good or bad that's more what

1498.17 --> 1506.8700000000001
it's about my my personal issues and

1504.37 --> 1509.06
back then I thought like yeah that's all

1506.87 --> 1511.1
fine and I just wonder sometimes Wow

1509.06 --> 1513.83
what it would have been like if I'd see

1511.1 --> 1515.6899999999998
that would I have caught on or what I

1513.83 --> 1518.3899999999999
have just have thought like wow this is

1515.69 --> 1523.13
really really liberal man it's like

1518.39 --> 1531.71
really liberal liberal as Alex likes to

1523.13 --> 1535.19
say and yeah they despite all the the

1531.71 --> 1539.42
80% character fill with just liberal and

1535.19 --> 1542.5700000000002
gay in every way you can think of they

1539.42 --> 1546.26
still did fold out the other 20% like

1542.57 --> 1551.9299999999998
yeah okay okay there at least they're

1546.26 --> 1555.47
not freaking psychos you know so it was

1551.93 --> 1558.65
like yeah I can't even say like sense8

1555.47 --> 1561.26
oh my god it is evil you know it is but

1558.65 --> 1565.01
it's just really really gay and really

1561.26 --> 1570.47
as you yeah really Alba GT bloody

1565.01 --> 1574.84
Britpop you know but anyway I kind of

1570.47 --> 1577.58
bumped into that I got through the first

1574.84 --> 1579.23
thing and then just thought like okay

1577.58 --> 1584.12
that's yeah

1579.23 --> 1588.38
yeah okay I get it now it's yeah that's

1584.12 --> 1593.33
good enough for now so moving on yeah

1588.38 --> 1595.7600000000002
and then I started watching Mission

1593.33 --> 1598.4499999999998
Impossible the latest one which is

1595.76 --> 1601.85
definitely not so gay

1598.45 --> 1608.049
although yeah we do know that some of

1601.85 --> 1608.049
these actors have closeted issues

1615.16 --> 1620.0800000000002
yeah good sir yeah well also one thing I

1618.28 --> 1623.5
notice is just there were a lot of like

1620.08 --> 1627.34
really drag queens story time things run

1623.5 --> 1630.88
people running around as well so it was

1627.34 --> 1632.9499999999998
just like everything we kind of know

1630.88 --> 1637.8400000000001
about what they're doing it was all in

1632.95 --> 1639.52
there it's just oh yeah

1637.84 --> 1640.9599999999998
I completely forgot about that search

[Music]

1702.2 --> 1706.1290000000001
do you know what dr. Stefan Lanka I

1704.749 --> 1712.059
don't know who that is

1706.129 --> 1712.059
alien attea sorry

1722.63 --> 1728.0990000000002
who

1724.91 --> 1728.0990000000002
[Music]

1731.75 --> 1738.18
and go Finnmark what

1735.11 --> 1738.1799999999998
[Music]

1756.93 --> 1764.559
[Music]

1759.009 --> 1772.34
anyway yeah so Netflix and stuff and

1764.559 --> 1778.309
swells I think that pretty much took up

1772.34 --> 1788.269
all my time and just yeah looking

1778.309 --> 1790.129
through news issues and oh yeah did I

1788.269 --> 1797.21
mention already oh yeah was a bit on

1790.129 --> 1800.4089999999999
24/7 discord but not too long and did I

1797.21 --> 1802.999
mention yesterday about the stores I

1800.409 --> 1806.45
think I went afterward I'm not too sure

1802.999 --> 1810.559
anymore but anyway I went to the store

1806.45 --> 1811.22
and like yeah I did talk about it it

1810.559 --> 1815.509
didn't I

1811.22 --> 1818.09
I remember now but yeah they did

1815.509 --> 1820.6390000000001
it's so weird because I still hear

1818.09 --> 1822.049
people and chats and all over the place

1820.639 --> 1825.2299999999998
just talk about oh it's all gonna be

1822.049 --> 1829.07
gone even I think somebody in chat here

1825.23 --> 1831.32
today said it but yeah the I asked the

1829.07 --> 1834.049
owner and they said like no no there's

1831.32 --> 1836.059
absolutely no sign that that there's

1834.049 --> 1841.009
actually gonna be assured it's it's just

1836.059 --> 1843.23
gonna be filled up again so yeah the

1841.009 --> 1846.019
silly thing is is that they even realize

1843.23 --> 1846.8600000000001
that yeah we're just gonna make a profit

1846.019 --> 1851.419
that's it

1846.86 --> 1853.6999999999998
because there is no shortage but yeah

1851.419 --> 1857.179
that's that may be just the Netherlands

1853.7 --> 1859.8790000000001
you know or maybe even just that store I

1857.179 --> 1863.269
don't know I didn't check with like the

1859.879 --> 1868.2199999999998
regular grocery store the overtime or or

1863.269 --> 1871.759
any of those but yeah so I don't feel I

1868.22 --> 1875.8990000000001
have anything to worry about concerning

1871.759 --> 1879.669
that but still I don't know how it is in

1875.899 --> 1879.6689999999999
America you know I really don't

1886.25 --> 1894.44
yeah

1888.08 --> 1897.74
right okay churn up those like yeah yeah

1894.44 --> 1902.06
oh me too mostly like what I did sort

1897.74 --> 1905.63
off is get extra packets of soup that's

1902.06 --> 1908.96
it like I got ten packets a soup with

1905.63 --> 1912.0200000000002
like including a couple of chicken soups

1908.96 --> 1916.82
you know that's yeah that's like half a

1912.02 --> 1919.55
meal and it can last forever pretty much

1916.82 --> 1922.6399999999999
forever all I need is water and some

1919.55 --> 1926.36
electricity for my water cooker and I

1922.64 --> 1929.0900000000001
got soups for I don't know four five

1926.36 --> 1931.1299999999999
days maybe if I if I had to eat it

1929.09 --> 1935.3899999999999
purely then I have five days worth of

1931.13 --> 1946.0600000000002
soup and it doesn't spoil so yeah that's

1935.39 --> 1949.94
just micro is it that that's the word

1946.06 --> 1952.28
measure yeah it's um it's just a small

1949.94 --> 1957.3500000000001
measure I don't feel I need to do

1952.28 --> 1960.6399999999999
anything more than that besides like so

1957.35 --> 1963.35
many people are stocking up like crazy

1960.64 --> 1965.51
so they're yeah it's just not a good

1963.35 --> 1968.23
time to do that I'll just wait until it

1965.51 --> 1971.27
fills back up and panics died out

1968.23 --> 1976.46
because I don't know in my mind I think

1971.27 --> 1978.41
that despite this corona flu the scare

1976.46 --> 1983.0
that is coming with it as it were I

1978.41 --> 1985.4
think there may be something else in the

1983.0 --> 1991.82
I don't know the not-too-distant future

1985.4 --> 1993.95
or I don't know when when we might still

1991.82 --> 1999.05
need it but maybe that is just the

1993.95 --> 2001.78
long-term prepper the yeah being always

1999.05 --> 2003.49
reminded like yeah it's better always

2001.78 --> 2007.09
could come something especially when

2003.49 --> 2010.3
certain people that are when controllers

2007.09 --> 2012.9099999999999
are at risk but basically and they're

2010.3 --> 2014.62
switching going on that's when you kind

2012.91 --> 2016.44
of need to stock up because then things

2014.62 --> 2020.4299999999998
get all jumbled or can

2016.44 --> 2023.49
jumble and it seems like that is kind of

2020.43 --> 2026.0700000000002
in the works especially in the United

2023.49 --> 2028.49
States feels like a lot of things could

2026.07 --> 2030.99
just happen but things could certainly

2028.49 --> 2032.88
rearrange because of the tension and

2030.99 --> 2038.34
because of just the blade and openness

2032.88 --> 2042.14
and you know the filth was it the field

2038.34 --> 2042.1399999999999
impeachment nonsense and all that

2042.2 --> 2049.35
there's more attention on it so stocking

2046.08 --> 2052.68
up on things you don't overkill but it's

2049.35 --> 2061.2599999999998
never really a bad idea just just don't

2052.68 --> 2064.3399999999997
panic about it don't get stupid well

2061.26 --> 2069.1200000000003
join up though that's amazing

2064.34 --> 2072.33
still stocked up from y2k right well you

2069.12 --> 2074.8199999999997
know those people I think they

2072.33 --> 2078.21
definitely would not need to stock up

2074.82 --> 2081.27
because they already got it and and also

2078.21 --> 2084.87
you know in a way stocking up especially

2081.27 --> 2089.04
on food items it is a good test

2084.87 --> 2090.7799999999997
you know if there's this odd side effect

2089.04 --> 2092.31
again you could almost say it like

2090.78 --> 2096.69
social engineering study that it

2092.31 --> 2101.1
concerns that that is not just behavior

2096.69 --> 2104.2200000000003
wise but practical like how good do

2101.1 --> 2105.92
certain storing methods work you know

2104.22 --> 2108.6
and then there's of course just

2105.92 --> 2111.03
historical research and all that but

2108.6 --> 2113.64
like mechanism specific storing

2111.03 --> 2115.9500000000003
mechanisms can be tested now and a lot

2113.64 --> 2118.6099999999997
of people that bought in the to the y2k

2115.95 --> 2120.77
stalking up well they will have been

2118.61 --> 2124.08
presented with certain industrial

2120.77 --> 2127.14
formats for that and it's a good test to

2124.08 --> 2130.44
see like how well did that work like

2127.14 --> 2133.04
after 20 years how well is that food you

2130.44 --> 2138.15
know what can we learn from that type of

2133.04 --> 2140.7599999999998
storing up of food so yeah the thing is

2138.15 --> 2142.9500000000003
even though you could think it is kind

2140.76 --> 2145.4
of senseless and maybe some wolf it will

2142.95 --> 2148.6499999999996
go rotten you can learn which types

2145.4 --> 2152.579
things go rotten and which don't

2148.65 --> 2156.1800000000003
so that eventually yeah people can get

2152.579 --> 2158.67
stored food and it will just all be good

2156.18 --> 2160.44
because all the bad ways that caused it

2158.67 --> 2163.349
to eventually go rotten will all have

2160.44 --> 2167.19
been taken out of the way it will be it

2163.349 --> 2171.079
will have been updated the technology

2167.19 --> 2180.71
for it see and that's a good thing

2171.079 --> 2180.71
that's just a good thing in my opinion

2181.609 --> 2193.23
nobody needs rotten food now of course

2190.89 --> 2198.2
in especially in the earlier 20th

2193.23 --> 2201.45
century that was already something that

2198.2 --> 2204.8689999999997
industry also focused on a little also

2201.45 --> 2207.6189999999997
thanks to war situations wet May which

2204.869 --> 2211.109
makes storing food incredibly important

2207.619 --> 2215.6600000000003
but what they did that then they were

2211.109 --> 2217.77
still kind of in the in the latter

2215.66 --> 2220.589
development wave of the chemical

2217.77 --> 2224.0389999999998
industry so what they did is use

2220.589 --> 2226.8289999999997
chemicals to as preservers now that's

2224.039 --> 2229.26
for example how eventually MSG came into

2226.829 --> 2234.2400000000002
being it was a preservative derived from

2229.26 --> 2237.289
chemical industry and others you know

2234.24 --> 2240.1189999999997
other things and so they used that

2237.289 --> 2241.98
basically overlooking the negative side

2240.119 --> 2244.7400000000002
effects that it has and that is a big

2241.98 --> 2247.589
lesson that has been learned in the 20th

2244.74 --> 2250.1699999999996
century like if you use chemical

2247.589 --> 2254.369
preservatives yes it stays it doesn't

2250.17 --> 2257.13
spoil but also it basically becomes not

2254.369 --> 2261.21
so nutritious anymore it's poison

2257.13 --> 2264.359
technically and now organic food

2261.21 --> 2269.279
revolution has worked its way through

2264.359 --> 2271.77
the common society a bit and so the

2269.279 --> 2275.069
storage food methods were are now

2271.77 --> 2276.48
different we don't throw poison through

2275.069 --> 2278.43
the food anymore to do that even though

2276.48 --> 2281.339
that's kind of basic and easy to do

2278.43 --> 2282.22
because it's not good quality so now the

2281.339 --> 2285.04
are

2282.22 --> 2289.5099999999998
Jannik food storage is basically what is

2285.04 --> 2291.88
kind of being tested and it's funny

2289.51 --> 2295.3590000000004
because a lot of it is throwback at

2291.88 --> 2298.06
techniques that vary yeah like even

2295.359 --> 2301.45
which is old witches and druids would do

2298.06 --> 2303.67
it's like drying your food freeze drying

2301.45 --> 2308.29
it or whatever and then putting it

2303.67 --> 2309.76
storing it in jars and then yeah the old

2308.29 --> 2312.25
times that would be a lot more

2309.76 --> 2314.32
complicated because yeah controlling the

2312.25 --> 2316.27
circumstances were kind of tough so a

2314.32 --> 2320.26
lot of that would eventually end up

2316.27 --> 2322.96
spoiled but of it would not and it's

2320.26 --> 2325.78
funny how now storing techniques are

2322.96 --> 2329.05
kind of partially also throwing back in

2325.78 --> 2330.5800000000004
their options to old very old storing

2329.05 --> 2334.7200000000003
techniques it's a good thing it's just

2330.58 --> 2336.97
back to nature back to how it was what

2334.72 --> 2339.3399999999997
is sensible what has survived throughout

2336.97 --> 2341.89
the ages naturally on its own without

2339.34 --> 2345.31
some monolithic system to hold it up for

2341.89 --> 2353.73
everyone to see funny how that works out

2345.31 --> 2356.38
isn't it so there you go

2353.73 --> 2360.4
historical summary about food storage

2356.38 --> 2365.29
developments because it is interesting

2360.4 --> 2367.51
in my opinion Noah was the ultimate

2365.29 --> 2370.89
prepper yeah well there's nothing works

2367.51 --> 2374.73
better than storing living food

2370.89 --> 2374.73
especially if it can still

2382.789 --> 2389.0890000000004
yet the best food storage is just a

2385.579 --> 2392.3100000000004
living plant with fruits and vegetables

2389.089 --> 2400.39
that can perpetuate itself

2392.31 --> 2400.39
[Music]

2411.54 --> 2418.25
yeah 39 are you

2434.109 --> 2437.109
hmm

2437.5 --> 2440.22
right

2440.79 --> 2446.58
okay so you're 39 and you wish you were

2443.43 --> 2448.89
19 that makes me think that you probably

2446.58 --> 2454.2599999999998
don't remember what it was like to be 19

2448.89 --> 2457.8199999999997
because she can never be that with the

2454.26 --> 2461.07
knowledge and wisdom that you have now

2457.82 --> 2463.53
so I often think like oh but man when I

2461.07 --> 2467.13
was 20 I felt so freakin healthy I was

2463.53 --> 2473.67
so quick so flexible yeah but I was also

2467.13 --> 2476.51
a freaking idiot I was like weak weak

2473.67 --> 2479.31
willed in a way but in a in a weird way

2476.51 --> 2482.94
because I was not weak willed in other

2479.31 --> 2485.67
ways but so yeah I don't wish I was that

2482.94 --> 2488.7000000000003
again I'm kind of happy without what I

2485.67 --> 2492.51
am now and even though yeah it doesn't

2488.7 --> 2495.96
have all the that vivid spark maybe as

2492.51 --> 2498.03
it used to be in a way what I have now

2495.96 --> 2501.63
feels so much more valuable to me

2498.03 --> 2504.42
because I really missed that when I was

2501.63 --> 2507.69
young like I already knew that I was

2504.42 --> 2509.76
missing it it was like to me when I was

2507.69 --> 2512.31
a teenager I know that it in a way it

2509.76 --> 2513.78
was excruciating not necessarily because

2512.31 --> 2517.65
the dark things that I've seen or

2513.78 --> 2521.2200000000003
whatever but just the feeling like oh my

2517.65 --> 2524.15
god I have so much energy in me but I

2521.22 --> 2529.68
can I can't deal with it

2524.15 --> 2531.96
Wow how can I build up something with

2529.68 --> 2535.52
this energy that is sensible in this

2531.96 --> 2539.01
world like doesn't make I can't get in I

2535.52 --> 2540.87
couldn't get in that's what I felt like

2539.01 --> 2544.32
when I was nine Yin was extremely

2540.87 --> 2546.69
frustrating and I spent a lot of time

2544.32 --> 2551.28
back then even kind of trying to dim

2546.69 --> 2556.73
myself down to become more adapted to

2551.28 --> 2556.73
the world and that doesn't work at all

2557.93 --> 2572.73
anyway yeah that's me I'm pretty I'm

2567.57 --> 2579.0
satisfied with being 40 I just want to

2572.73 --> 2582.21
continue and ya realize that things that

2579.0 --> 2586.43
may have seemed to be lost might simply

2582.21 --> 2589.44
be different it's not lost it's just

2586.43 --> 2591.21
it's not so gushing in the open anymore

2589.44 --> 2593.82
but it doesn't mean that it is lost I

2591.21 --> 2595.38
said as I said I think and I've heard

2593.82 --> 2598.05
the right circumstances with the right

2595.38 --> 2600.9
kind of energy and all that and which I

2598.05 --> 2604.71
do have sometimes I can do

2600.9 --> 2606.48
I could be extremely quick I can be

2604.71 --> 2609.27
whatever I need

2606.48 --> 2616.31
it's just that I can't do that all the

2609.27 --> 2622.85
time really getting a sick you think so

2616.31 --> 2629.22
Thanks if I've never looked my age ever

2622.85 --> 2631.38
it was weird when I was young like when

2629.22 --> 2636.7099999999996
I was like 12 or something I look older

2631.38 --> 2639.69
as in my physique look older my my mind

2636.71 --> 2644.1
that seemed almost like an artist to

2639.69 --> 2647.28
some people in a way just I was me I was

2644.1 --> 2651.36
weird but yeah when I was young I looked

2647.28 --> 2654.69
older quicker than others but then as I

2651.36 --> 2657.0
got older I it didn't it didn't migrate

2654.69 --> 2660.3
so then suddenly I just started to look

2657.0 --> 2665.7
younger I think when I really looked my

2660.3 --> 2667.8
age the most I think I was 17 and I kind

2665.7 --> 2670.08
of really did look my age I think I

2667.8 --> 2671.67
think I don't know what does of

2670.08 --> 2681.0
seven-year-old look like I don't know

2671.67 --> 2683.52
man hmm but after that I just yeah I got

2681.0 --> 2687.24
older but I didn't really look older and

2683.52 --> 2691.38
that kind of went in a consistent slide

2687.24 --> 2694.99
it's like okay I guess I just look

2691.38 --> 2697.6600000000003
my aging goes half-speed compared to the

2694.99 --> 2699.91
average and I've worked on it also

2697.66 --> 2702.52
because I kind of knew like okay if I'm

2699.91 --> 2704.5
just gonna say screw my body screw

2702.52 --> 2705.0099999999998
everything I'm gonna go for Masuda call

2704.5 --> 2708.1
[ __ ]

2705.01 --> 2709.96
kind of like my what my mom did then

2708.1 --> 2713.62
yeah I'll turn into a freaking troll

2709.96 --> 2715.84
I'll age oh yeah so I thought no no I'm

2713.62 --> 2720.43
just gonna actually be very thankful

2715.84 --> 2722.65
that I have this inheritance genetically

2720.43 --> 2725.3399999999997
that's what I'm gonna presume it is my

2722.65 --> 2733.51
dad also it doesn't age very quickly

2725.34 --> 2737.77
visualize and honor it by not by

2733.51 --> 2740.7700000000004
actually taking care of my body so that

2737.77 --> 2744.61
that ability can shine through properly

2740.77 --> 2748.9
so the design can be showed I don't know

2744.61 --> 2751.1800000000003
and I'm glad that I'm very it's it's

2748.9 --> 2757.11
probably one of my best decisions ever

2751.18 --> 2759.49
in my life that I did that so happy and

2757.11 --> 2762.82
it was kind of tough because there were

2759.49 --> 2765.8799999999997
times when I just was so in anguish and

2762.82 --> 2769.75
hated myself so bad that I would yeah

2765.88 --> 2774.73
that I wanted to that that I would

2769.75 --> 2778.65
almost give it up or maybe yeah and I'm

2774.73 --> 2781.48
so glad I just never it never got to me

2778.65 --> 2784.4100000000003
that eventually snapped out of that and

2781.48 --> 2787.27
then just like no I don't have a plan

2784.41 --> 2791.56
but I do have a plan of approach and

2787.27 --> 2795.7
that is get healthy get all this poison

2791.56 --> 2797.77
out of me from the past and from bad

2795.7 --> 2800.83
experiences which also make the body

2797.77 --> 2803.14
basically create poison in a way and I

2800.83 --> 2804.88
kept on working on they said like no I'm

2803.14 --> 2806.83
never gonna stop this I'm gonna do this

2804.88 --> 2809.7000000000003
the rest of my life it's the best

2806.83 --> 2809.7
decision I've ever made

2812.58 --> 2819.61
and I can still have fun too because I

2817.69 --> 2821.29
still smoke even even though I thought I

2819.61 --> 2823.98
probably would be better if I had

2821.29 --> 2826.75
stopped but yeah there's yeah there's

2823.98 --> 2831.28
filters now so that helps a little

2826.75 --> 2833.65
and I even still drink beers now that's

2831.28 --> 2837.46
now I'm absolutely certain that's not

2833.65 --> 2841.59
gonna last forever because yeah it's

2837.46 --> 2844.63
just I'm relatively sensitive to it and

2841.59 --> 2848.28
the burden of it will increase as I got

2844.63 --> 2852.04
getting older so and that will probably

2848.28 --> 2854.59
aggravate more than my actual appearing

2852.04 --> 2857.2599999999998
appearance aging so I have to be careful

2854.59 --> 2861.28
with alcohol I know I have to but I

2857.26 --> 2863.8300000000004
still enjoy it in in small amounts

2861.28 --> 2870.07
especially compared to what most that

2863.83 --> 2872.65
drink use hmm yeah mark caller I don't

2870.07 --> 2883.03
smoke cigarettes I really only smoke

2872.65 --> 2885.34
joints and I don't know yeah have to say

2883.03 --> 2887.88
quite a few but you know one joint is

2885.34 --> 2887.88
not the other

2892.88 --> 2898.309
but I don't change smoke or anything

2895.299 --> 2900.589
because that's yeah I do need like some

2898.309 --> 2909.739
after I smell that just need some time

2900.589 --> 2911.9
to kind of let it go through me no I do

2909.739 --> 2917.239
mix with tobacco I used to smoke pure

2911.9 --> 2919.96
before but it has like more

2917.239 --> 2924.41
psychological backlash when I do that

2919.96 --> 2926.329
the impact becomes too big kind of

2924.41 --> 2929.45
Diskin towards my spirit when I do that

2926.329 --> 2931.2490000000003
and had some trouble with it like when I

2929.45 --> 2937.1899999999996
still did that that's well yeah because

2931.249 --> 2939.3799999999997
I did stop smoking tobacco and then now

2937.19 --> 2942.38
first I did this is years is like a

2939.38 --> 2945.349
decade ago but first I stopped smoking

2942.38 --> 2946.9100000000003
cannabis because I I couldn't handle it

2945.349 --> 2949.7290000000003
anymore it was just having a negative

2946.91 --> 2952.7
effect on me because I was using it to

2949.729 --> 2954.2889999999998
escape and I had to stop that and you

2952.7 --> 2956.0589999999997
knew it no one was really pissed off and

2954.289 --> 2960.7690000000002
then I stopped and I was like wow so

2956.059 --> 2962.3190000000004
glad so I quit for like eight years they

2960.769 --> 2965.569
were five I don't remember which one

2962.319 --> 2969.14
five and now very long time very

2965.569 --> 2971.299
persistently and they kept on smoking

2969.14 --> 2973.339
tobacco though and then at some point I

2971.299 --> 2977.329
also quit tobacco and that was mostly

2973.339 --> 2981.259
because I yeah I got a girlfriend my ex

2977.329 --> 2983.3900000000003
now that really hated smoking so I

2981.259 --> 2985.729
thought like screw that I need smoking

2983.39 --> 2989.239
when you got this you know and that

2985.729 --> 2991.46
worked out great and I didn't return to

2989.239 --> 2995.71
smoking but I did return kind of to

2991.46 --> 2995.71
cannabis because of I don't know the I

2996.369 --> 3002.4990000000003
tried it out again basically for a

2999.95 --> 3005.1899999999996
medicinal go and yeah especially if

3002.499 --> 3008.769
you're not used to using it it does like

3005.19 --> 3010.509
the CBD I guess and THC combined it just

3008.769 --> 3015.279
makes this impact and your metabolism

3010.509 --> 3017.92
and it purify it's like it almost made

3015.279 --> 3020.049
me almost it made me look younger it

3017.92 --> 3023.079
helped me rest really well when I first

3020.049 --> 3024.599
used it again without a lot of

3023.079 --> 3027.809
psychological backlash

3024.599 --> 3031.549
the problem was though that it kind of

3027.809 --> 3036.719
got me hooked again and then I slowly

3031.549 --> 3039.989
started like using once a week the

3036.719 --> 3043.7690000000002
weekends and yeah so I got hooked again

3039.989 --> 3045.239
but also got hooked because I was

3043.769 --> 3048.839
already feeling that kind of the

3045.239 --> 3051.509
relation was going sour it was weird

3048.839 --> 3055.349
because when I originally I basically

3051.509 --> 3058.499
found back an old bag of cannabis that I

3055.349 --> 3059.1600000000003
grew myself from my old home even it was

3058.499 --> 3061.229
pretty old

3059.16 --> 3062.64
it was great stuff and they left it

3061.229 --> 3064.589
there when I stopped work ever said like

3062.64 --> 3068.299
yeah I have this I'm gonna leave it

3064.589 --> 3069.719
there and I left it there for years I

3068.299 --> 3071.819
didn't touch it

3069.719 --> 3075.7490000000003
and then I thought like now okay I'm

3071.819 --> 3078.299
gonna try this again and then I got

3075.749 --> 3080.669
caught on it but the weird thing was is

3078.299 --> 3082.829
that when I originally tried out I kind

3080.669 --> 3085.41
of asked permission for my girlfriend I

3082.829 --> 3089.429
was like yeah I haven't smoked for why I

3085.41 --> 3091.3799999999997
was very addicted to this but I could

3089.429 --> 3094.859
try it what do you think and she was

3091.38 --> 3096.869
like so careless about like yeah sure go

3094.859 --> 3100.109
ahead even though I told her like yeah

3096.869 --> 3104.159
but I was really addicted that that was

3100.109 --> 3105.859
kind of a bad sign you know and that bad

3104.159 --> 3109.88
sign

3105.859 --> 3109.88
kind of made it happen in a way

3111.64 --> 3116.89
it was like the first sign and that

3113.38 --> 3118.69
already kind of threw me back into an

3116.89 --> 3120.73
addictive mode to escape from the

3118.69 --> 3124.3
realization that apparently she didn't

3120.73 --> 3126.37
really care that much about me to just

3124.3 --> 3129.19
say it like that after everything I said

3126.37 --> 3134.7
she is very complicated these moments

3129.19 --> 3139.81
and well anyway yeah eventually broke up

3134.7 --> 3142.6
terrible time and the pure smoking did

3139.81 --> 3144.79
not help when I was when you feel really

3142.6 --> 3147.1
shitty in the pure smoke it's just tear

3144.79 --> 3150.22
it was terrible for me did not

3147.1 --> 3153.91
contribute good things but I was kind of

3150.22 --> 3157.7799999999997
lost for a while anyway it got out of it

3153.91 --> 3160.06
and at some point I was like okay I

3157.78 --> 3163.1200000000003
don't really know how to fix the

3160.06 --> 3165.04
situation but I this pure smoking is not

3163.12 --> 3168.04
working I'm gonna risk it I'm gonna try

3165.04 --> 3171.49
to back Oh again I said as a emergency

3168.04 --> 3174.49
measure because I remember that it did

3171.49 --> 3179.5
calm me down so I kind know no pain

3174.49 --> 3181.5299999999997
pills ever I never used those never it's

3179.5 --> 3187.72
not about physical pain

3181.53 --> 3192.55
it's about tension and anguish yes I

3187.72 --> 3198.16
know it sounds very angsty you know it's

3192.55 --> 3202.09
just what it is but I I started using

3198.16 --> 3205.72
tobacco again and that immediately fixed

3202.09 --> 3210.52
it it sounds so stupid but it fixed like

3205.72 --> 3214.83
the the panic reaction I got from the

3210.52 --> 3219.91
pure smoking and yeah well that's now

3214.83 --> 3222.99
three years ago and yeah I haven't

3219.91 --> 3222.99
really been able to stop

3226.099 --> 3234.9300000000003
although yeah I did now discover the air

3230.04 --> 3236.7
these special filters which made the

3234.93 --> 3241.0789999999997
whole experience a lot less detrimental

3236.7 --> 3245.5789999999997
for my lungs just don't have so much

3241.079 --> 3247.88
trouble with it anymore and that's where

3245.579 --> 3247.88
I am now

3265.27 --> 3271.3
right

3268.07 --> 3271.3
[Music]

3275.53 --> 3283.4
[Music]

3277.85 --> 3283.4
but that's okay more kaulder

3290.83 --> 3294.98
yeah I don't know a lot of people

3293.12 --> 3301.04
personally that have been ruined by

3294.98 --> 3303.32
opiates but I guess you could say my

3301.04 --> 3307.4
mother's life because she she did start

3303.32 --> 3310.4300000000003
to eventually use like all this but that

3307.4 --> 3313.31
was like after cancer so it yeah it's

3310.43 --> 3318.16
not you can't really say that all I did

3313.31 --> 3322.46
know is that she was on methadone and

3318.16 --> 3327.43
she liked it malformed her entire

3322.46 --> 3332.4700000000003
character she like got really dark and

3327.43 --> 3332.47
angry from it for no reason

3332.48 --> 3338.45
but yeah the life was already kinda

3335.15 --> 3340.28
screwed up at that point so I've never

3338.45 --> 3342.62
really witnessed like friends or

3340.28 --> 3350.96
whatever that from being like a normal

3342.62 --> 3352.7
guy suddenly went on that I always felt

3350.96 --> 3357.37
like I was that guy a little bit more

3352.7 --> 3357.37
but I it was just with my cannabis and

3362.0 --> 3369.349
yeah it's kind of weird because I've

3364.13 --> 3376.48
been shamed a lot by people for smoking

3369.349 --> 3379.849
cannabis like a lot and not really like

3376.48 --> 3383.599
how you say not c-level bad like really

3379.849 --> 3388.01
angry and [ __ ] but just disapproval from

3383.599 --> 3395.75
a lot of people and you could have say

3388.01 --> 3397.88
that I was almost asking for it and it

3395.75 --> 3403.07
still kind of echoes on like I still

3397.88 --> 3405.56
feel like I shouldn't be smoking the

3403.07 --> 3407.54
weird isn't it you know it's kind of

3405.56 --> 3410.48
like yeah sure it's okay they actually

3407.54 --> 3413.54
has good things and but I still can't

3410.48 --> 3415.75
help but feel from the inside that's

3413.54 --> 3418.93
like I shouldn't do this actually I

3415.75 --> 3418.93
don't know

3425.87 --> 3429.35
get out of here

3435.13 --> 3439.62
it's not about being legal even

3445.81 --> 3452.0499999999997
but look maybe that feeling stems from

3449.02 --> 3455.71
kind of like how I've used it because I

3452.05 --> 3462.7000000000003
have used it so badly as like an escape

3455.71 --> 3464.7400000000002
mechanism and maybe that is the reason

3462.7 --> 3466.54
why I feel like I shouldn't take it

3464.74 --> 3469.45
because it's almost been tied into that

3466.54 --> 3474.6
escape mechanism and that is bad that is

3469.45 --> 3474.6
not good it is the opposite of ascension

3474.9 --> 3483.9700000000003
but I do my best not to use it like that

3478.63 --> 3485.7400000000002
anymore and I don't because I still

3483.97 --> 3488.5
remember like every time you go they're

3485.74 --> 3490.3599999999997
like real really shitty and I'm like oh

3488.5 --> 3491.29
I need to smoke something to get this

3490.36 --> 3493.57
off my mind

3491.29 --> 3495.43
well that doesn't happen anymore I don't

3493.57 --> 3499.6000000000004
fall for that anymore because it always

3495.43 --> 3503.5299999999997
sucks it always grows worse from there

3499.6 --> 3505.63
on you get stuck in that mindset and

3503.53 --> 3507.8700000000003
that I don't allow that to happen to me

3505.63 --> 3507.87
anymore

3514.68 --> 3517.7999999999997
[Music]

3531.49 --> 3538.6299999999997
prescribed marijuana taking the industry

3534.11 --> 3538.63
by storm okay

3552.22 --> 3554.97
hmm

3556.45 --> 3562.54
yeah yeah you're the current Slayer I

3560.01 --> 3564.34
think I know what you mean I don't know

3562.54 --> 3567.1
how bad you have that but I have it in a

3564.34 --> 3569.05
way to it it's like okay technically I

3567.1 --> 3572.02
could for example go to the store and

3569.05 --> 3575.0800000000004
buy six beers and then I say okay I'm

3572.02 --> 3578.38
gonna take three today and I'm gonna

3575.08 --> 3582.1
take two tomorrow or at a three tomorrow

3578.38 --> 3584.53
right and then yeah I'll be going and

3582.1 --> 3587.83
just having such a blast that I'll do

3584.53 --> 3590.17
like a screwed when I'll just take the

3587.83 --> 3594.31
extra one I'll buy an extra one in the

3590.17 --> 3596.08
day and then yeah if I don't grow sick

3594.31 --> 3601.75
or anything which can typically happen

3596.08 --> 3603.85
with me then I'll just keep on going but

3601.75 --> 3607.21
yeah the more I do drink then the worse

3603.85 --> 3609.4
the backlash eventually becomes but yeah

3607.21 --> 3611.05
it's very tough for me if I have it so I

3609.4 --> 3617.94
just make sure I don't have it I just

3611.05 --> 3621.1000000000004
have a set amount can't have more hmm

3617.94 --> 3624.94
right okay well that's nice

3621.1 --> 3627.6
eleven years that's that's pretty long

3624.94 --> 3627.6
well done

3641.09 --> 3646.4500000000003
yeah mark color is sort of look it also

3644.21 --> 3650.21
depends on your Constitution you know I

3646.45 --> 3653.6299999999997
simply cannot handle this over a certain

3650.21 --> 3657.83
amount of beer I just can't I was never

3653.63 --> 3665.12
really good at handling that but as I

3657.83 --> 3667.73
get older the it gets worse but yeah if

3665.12 --> 3670.39
you don't if you're like a bigger guy or

3667.73 --> 3673.85
whatever and you you can handle a lot

3670.39 --> 3677.12
then if you don't have the mechanism to

3673.85 --> 3680.54
stop you yet then indeed you could like

3677.12 --> 3684.64
tank away insane amounts of beer and

3680.54 --> 3684.64
feel really shitty the next morning I

3685.3 --> 3689.23
would never get there though

3694.9 --> 3699.9900000000002
drink some water for God's sake

3717.51 --> 3729.0
Wow okay that sucks more color hmm if I

3727.38 --> 3733.32
got that from two bears

3729.0 --> 3736.95
I would just stop you know I would just

3733.32 --> 3741.119
no longer do it one thing I learned in

3736.95 --> 3743.27
how to handle it the best like when I

3741.119 --> 3748.3500000000004
get the worst backlash from alcohol is

3743.27 --> 3750.3
when I drink really late and then go to

3748.35 --> 3751.71
bed when it's when I'm still under

3750.3 --> 3754.53
influence that's when the biggest

3751.71 --> 3756.63
problems arrived the next day but if I

3754.53 --> 3760.1000000000004
just drink like in the evening or

3756.63 --> 3764.28
something and then keep on going until

3760.1 --> 3766.98
eventually is completely worn off and

3764.28 --> 3769.7400000000002
had plenty of other fluids like tea to

3766.98 --> 3772.83
replace it as it were then I have

3769.74 --> 3774.8999999999996
absolutely no issues sleeping or feeling

3772.83 --> 3778.65
bad the next day and I've been doing

3774.9 --> 3779.34
this well daily now for Quietus quite

3778.65 --> 3783.2000000000003
some time

3779.34 --> 3783.2000000000003
this works out fine

3788.11 --> 3793.1800000000003
but it is really important that for me

3791.17 --> 3796.41
at least that if I'm gonna drink that I

3793.18 --> 3796.41
don't drink too late

3817.34 --> 3821.56
lish that sucks

3823.05 --> 3826.7000000000003
that's a lot of allergies

3841.85 --> 3845.91
all right

3843.9 --> 3850.46
yeah that sounds more like you're just

3845.91 --> 3855.799
having a an overreaction problem itself

3850.46 --> 3855.799
that's very that's very annoying

3863.28 --> 3868.23
in a way I think that my mother had

3865.349 --> 3870.599
similar problems problem was she was

3868.23 --> 3872.4
just she could not handle it she could

3870.599 --> 3874.5
not handle the experiences that came

3872.4 --> 3877.56
with it and she just go nuts on

3874.5 --> 3886.2
pharmaceuticals because she just did not

3877.56 --> 3888.84
want to experience it but I think the if

3886.2 --> 3892.77
I may add something you know about that

3888.84 --> 3896.609
for that type of body that kind of

3892.77 --> 3900.42
reaction the only way to get through

3896.609 --> 3902.94
that properly is by I don't know

3900.42 --> 3907.109
mentally gaining pure control over your

3902.94 --> 3909.599
own stress system if you get pure

3907.109 --> 3913.2
control over that you literally cannot

3909.599 --> 3915.54
get triggered unless you literally

3913.2 --> 3919.83
choose to if you can get to that point

3915.54 --> 3922.8
then you could also basically manage the

3919.83 --> 3924.72
stress and allergic reactions but yet I

3922.8 --> 3931.4900000000002
require something the insane levels of

3924.72 --> 3934.859
discipline potential your life's work to

3931.49 --> 3938.18
get there that can definitely where it's

3934.859 --> 3938.18
probably the only thing that does work

3938.45 --> 3944.49
in a way I tried it well because I do

3941.13 --> 3948.119
have some tendencies for oversensitivity

3944.49 --> 3954.9599999999996
especially to allergic reactions to add

3948.119 --> 3957.06
a histamine but I yeah I also AM half my

3954.96 --> 3960.7200000000003
dad in a way and he does not have that

3957.06 --> 3965.67
thank God so it's not as bad as my mom

3960.72 --> 3969.089
had it and with my personal self

3965.67 --> 3974.01
development discipline concerning my

3969.089 --> 3976.44
feelings I I i practically practically

3974.01 --> 3978.0890000000004
am and maybe it all depends on how

3976.44 --> 3983.46
you're gonna consider it but literally

3978.089 --> 3986.099
don't have any allergies whatsoever even

3983.46 --> 3989.28
though I used to but then I started to

3986.099 --> 3991.589
eat organic very carefully start to make

3989.28 --> 3996.509
my own food

3991.589 --> 4001.609
be my own doctor avoiding poison and

3996.509 --> 4004.16
guess what it all went away and then the

4001.609 --> 4007.759
only apparent allergies came from

4004.16 --> 4009.949
stressing out like her getting so pissed

4007.759 --> 4014.299
off and then eventually getting itchy

4009.949 --> 4017.289
tacks on that [ __ ] it's pure stress well

4014.299 --> 4020.119
yeah that's not gonna go away unless you

4017.289 --> 4023.989
apply discipline so you don't let the

4020.119 --> 4029.15
feelings arise to that level in order to

4023.989 --> 4032.28
trigger that physiological reaction yeah

all right that's mine hmm I've never had

4056.38 --> 4065.4390000000003
asthma thank God even my mother had it I

4060.689 --> 4067.89
think my brother had it too a bit but I

4065.439 --> 4067.89
haven't

4080.57 --> 4089.2000000000003
I did have like colds almost constantly

4084.17 --> 4089.2000000000003
as kid though but never asthma

4117.759 --> 4126.779
Wow that's I don't know how to respond

4124.0 --> 4126.779
to that mark color

4135.81 --> 4140.52
person I think that well I'm not in that

4138.24 --> 4144.42
situation and I love cats I just thank

4140.52 --> 4148.77
God I'm not allergic to them but if I

4144.42 --> 4151.859
were I would not care how much my kids

4148.77 --> 4154.200000000001
are gonna beg for a cat I just said no

4151.859 --> 4157.26
I'm freaking allergic to them is sorry

4154.2 --> 4161.37
if you want cats you're gonna have to

4157.26 --> 4165.93
visit the cat outside or over at some

4161.37 --> 4168.38

George Sanford that's interesting wheat

4203.86 --> 4209.0199999999995
right yeah there was an issue about that

4206.41 --> 4212.19
too well I can tell you something about

4209.02 --> 4216.46
wheat and what the issue is with wheat

4212.19 --> 4222.12
with the grain type used for common

4216.46 --> 4225.19
bread and all that wheat isn't

4222.12 --> 4226.72
originally there was some alert allergy

4225.19 --> 4230.469999999999
problems with it but it's not because of

4226.72 --> 4235.3
glyphosate okay I don't think there is

4230.47 --> 4239.47
any GMO wheat like that although I'm not

4235.3 --> 4242.860000000001
sure but wheat has other problems and

4239.47 --> 4247.0
that is that yeah it's about the plant

4242.86 --> 4254.799999999999
itself there is a certain type of what

4247.0 --> 4258.07
is it like a cell membrane it's like a

4254.8 --> 4260.71
little layer in between there and the

4258.07 --> 4264.46
weird thing is is that layer is just

4260.71 --> 4267.19
part of the plant it gets typically

4264.46 --> 4272.74
infected with a very specific type of

4267.19 --> 4275.5
fungi and that fungi that is the thing

4272.74 --> 4279.37
that makes a weed detrimental because it

4275.5 --> 4282.43
causes like a weird almost allergic

4279.37 --> 4284.7699999999995
reaction I think that's I hope I

4282.43 --> 4288.400000000001
remember this correctly but that is kind

4284.77 --> 4290.950000000001
of the problem with weed and you can

4288.4 --> 4294.79
bypass this by using other types of

4290.95 --> 4298.71
grain like I do I avoid wheat because I

4294.79 --> 4298.71
do have that effect it's not very good

4298.92 --> 4305.08
but I use spelt based bread and those

4304.0 --> 4309.3
and all that

4305.08 --> 4309.3
spelt spelled doesn't have that

4315.01 --> 4321.04
so it's not necessarily glyphosate

4317.55 --> 4327.1900000000005
because it that issue was there with

4321.04 --> 4329.67
bread even before before glyphosate even

4327.19 --> 4329.669999999999
existed

4351.999 --> 4358.989
now what you had a cat that could hurt

4355.869 --> 4369.239
chickens that's interesting

4358.989 --> 4369.239
sorry to hear he's passed away IRA Neffe

4391.949 --> 4394.638999999999
Wow

4396.28 --> 4402.5199999999995
yeah that's a crazy story more colored

4399.69 --> 4405.639999999999
yeah it's so weird because I even

4402.52 --> 4411.55
remember that like Blacky or something

4405.64 --> 4414.070000000001
it's like a an old yeah innocent type of

4411.55 --> 4416.41
pet name you know so it's so weird that

4414.07 --> 4419.25
people would go spiraling out of control

4416.41 --> 4419.25
over that now

4432.73 --> 4439.179999999999
it's like you can't name anything after

4435.73 --> 4442.36
a color anymore that's when it comes

4439.18 --> 4445.06
down to it just it's not allowed or

4442.36 --> 4447.179999999999
people will go nuts think you're talking

4445.06 --> 4450.31
about slavery or whatever

4447.18 --> 4450.31

4529.76 --> 4536.81
right hmm I do my best get in sick

4534.1 --> 4539.2390000000005
although sometimes yeah it does

4536.81 --> 4544.7300000000005
basically end up in me staring at the

4539.239 --> 4546.53
screen not saying a lot so but yeah and

4544.73 --> 4548.989
the other hand you know we I've already

4546.53 --> 4551.8099999999995
been going for an hour and 50 minutes I

4548.989 --> 4553.929999999999
think I had I was quite chatty most of

4551.81 --> 4553.93
it

4556.77 --> 4559.879000000001
[Music]

4567.679 --> 4580.9400000000005
yeah yeah I run Effie I know I miss

4577.85 --> 4586.219
having a cat too so I kind of have a a

4580.94 --> 4591.98
cat halfway it's the neighborhood cat of

4586.219 --> 4595.909
this of this building and so yeah it it

4591.98 --> 4597.65
basically comes by and then just say uh

4595.909 --> 4600.98
please give me something to eat

4597.65 --> 4603.889999999999
and yeah there are multiple people doing

4600.98 --> 4607.28
that just letting him in and he's really

4603.89 --> 4611.570000000001
gentle and nice and very obsessed with

4607.28 --> 4615.62
food but he's nice and he's cuddly and

4611.57 --> 4618.32
and I do miss cats but I just this is

4615.62 --> 4621.89
not a place for a cat you know if I get

4618.32 --> 4625.58
a cat again I just have to have the

4621.89 --> 4628.7300000000005
proper garden I'm not gonna lock a cat

4625.58 --> 4632.679
up again in some flat I'm not gonna do

4628.73 --> 4632.678999999999
it I refuse it's not natural

4649.12 --> 4655.18
am i furry cat like getting sick really

4652.64 --> 4655.18
how

4668.199 --> 4673.749
hmm yeah cats go nuts over catnip but

4672.249 --> 4675.4
you got to be careful with that stuff

4673.749 --> 4682.269
though because it is literally like

4675.4 --> 4703.509999999999
heroin to them like they can literally

4682.269 --> 4705.519
go addicted to it oh god please do not

4703.51 --> 4712.179
compare me with the cat from Red Dwarf

4705.519 --> 4715.749
thanks that cat is gay although he was a

4712.179 --> 4717.519
very funny character I did appreciate it

4715.749 --> 4722.619
but I don't like to be compared to that

4717.519 --> 4728.860000000001
but you know I've always been a cat

4722.619 --> 4742.679
person though always I don't know I have

4728.86 --> 4745.539
a kind of like a know let's just say I I

4742.679 --> 4748.53
understand the spirit spirit of cat and

4745.539 --> 4758.92
I can definitely act like that in

4748.53 --> 4760.84
certain ways like I I I always felt in a

4758.92 --> 4764.429
way like I understand cats better than I

4760.84 --> 4769.150000000001
understand humans because cats are like

4764.429 --> 4771.67
cats are not gonna be fooled in the

4769.15 --> 4775.509999999999
sense that they really know what they

4771.67 --> 4778.599
are and who they are like you can't fool

4775.51 --> 4782.159000000001
a cat in a way not really you can trick

4778.599 --> 4782.159000000001
it maybe officially or with it but

4783.749 --> 4790.92
if cats mindset that's very very tough

4788.369 --> 4794.789
to make them do something that they

4790.92 --> 4797.46
don't want to because they know it's

4794.789 --> 4800.639
like you can't like a dog is easily

4797.46 --> 4801.869
fooled you know very easily it's just

4800.639 --> 4804.92
one trick after they are they're just

4801.869 --> 4809.119
looking for the next trick to engage in

4804.92 --> 4812.46
what cats are like no they're just like

4809.119 --> 4815.07
what's going on what's bothering this

4812.46 --> 4816.409
person or hey what's moving over there

4815.07 --> 4819.989
mm-hmm

4816.409 --> 4828.71
or just like I don't want to do anything

4819.989 --> 4831.388999999999
you know but they know what's going on

4828.71 --> 4833.789
most of them there are some really dumb

4831.389 --> 4835.650000000001
cats though but I think that even that

4833.789 --> 4838.619
is not even natural because it's

4835.65 --> 4843.449
probably due to a vaccine damage don't

4838.619 --> 4845.61
forget that yeah cats also gets

4843.449 --> 4847.589999999999
subjected to vaccines and [ __ ] and I

4845.61 --> 4852.21
don't always think it's really a good

4847.59 --> 4855.409000000001
thing I think they're getting the same

4852.21 --> 4855.409
problem as humans do

4875.66 --> 4886.05
yes you the evil eye I always think it's

4882.3 --> 4890.6
funny when a cat is like huh eleven

4886.05 --> 4893.820000000001
o'clock I win am i pushing it yeah

4890.6 --> 4896.22
you're probably pushing it I think I'm

4893.82 --> 4899.429999999999
gonna run out to the show in in ten

4896.22 --> 4903.0
minutes or something sorry

4899.43 --> 4904.29
I need some some breakfast yet you can't

4903.0 --> 4906.3
even call it lunch I haven't eaten

4904.29 --> 4908.46
anything yet except for supplements a

4906.3 --> 4914.1
cup of coffee and some tea I kind of

4908.46 --> 4916.29
need to eat but I always think that the

4914.1 --> 4918.06
funniest look that cats have is when

4916.29 --> 4920.22
they're actually kind of comfortable

4918.06 --> 4924.030000000001
just sitting there like purring or what

4920.22 --> 4927.81
everything and then something happens

4924.03 --> 4931.05
and they are like yeah I'm enjoying it

4927.81 --> 4935.490000000001
this but I'm annoyed by this distraction

4931.05 --> 4936.72
they're like like there's ghosts like

4935.49 --> 4938.94
they're not really pissed off but

4936.72 --> 4944.55
they're like yeah I'm still happy but

4938.94 --> 4956.429999999999
I'm that is like such a cat look and I

4944.55 --> 4960.320000000001
think that is amazing yeah cats can have

4956.43 --> 4960.320000000001
like this very expressive looks

4960.76 --> 4963.869000000001
[Music]

4984.59 --> 4988.43
no I haven't seen that getting a sick no

4987.11 --> 4991.25
idea what you're talking about

4988.43 --> 4993.610000000001
oh yeah and by the way Irene Fei I

4991.25 --> 4996.19
almost forgot to mention that but yes

4993.61 --> 5003.759999999999
there's an odd thing about cats

4996.19 --> 5007.8099999999995
they absorb stress frequency energy also

5003.76 --> 5011.59
the energy that lingers so for example

5007.81 --> 5014.1900000000005
imagine you have a job at a desk

5011.59 --> 5017.59
somewhere in your home you have a cat

5014.19 --> 5020.049999999999
yeah and in a certain period you're got

5017.59 --> 5022.66
really stressed out like really bad

5020.05 --> 5026.02
because it's like oh my god business is

5022.66 --> 5029.74
falling apart and I'm like if I let it

5026.02 --> 5032.02
crumble I'll lose everything even though

5029.74 --> 5034.78
it seems completely and you're like

5032.02 --> 5036.910000000001
working really that's with a lot of

5034.78 --> 5038.32
feelings of desperation and stress and

5036.91 --> 5040.45
people are not caught and you're like

5038.32 --> 5042.04
cursing a lot of [ __ ] and you go through

5040.45 --> 5045.28
a very annoying period like that and

5042.04 --> 5047.91
maybe even though burn out well say that

5045.28 --> 5052.33
goes on for a month - or whatever and

5047.91 --> 5054.01
yeah that place is gonna be absorbing a

5052.33 --> 5057.49
lot of stress and you're gonna feel it

5054.01 --> 5060.46
when you come back there like it'll be

5057.49 --> 5063.82
like that was I felt like [ __ ] you can

5060.46 --> 5066.13
still feel it it's there or cats feel

5063.82 --> 5069.73
that [ __ ] and they'll go to it

5066.13 --> 5072.64
immediately so a cat will then typically

5069.73 --> 5075.969999999999
just jump on your chair on your working

5072.64 --> 5079.21
chair seem to get like in the way on

5075.97 --> 5080.95
purpose it'll go like no I'm sitting

5079.21 --> 5084.88
here you're gonna go somewhere else

5080.95 --> 5087.7
and it's like dude I gotta work I was

5084.88 --> 5089.86
like no I'm sitting here and it's like

5087.7 --> 5092.23
it's gonna be almost insulted when you

5089.86 --> 5094.75
actually say no I'm gonna sit here is

5092.23 --> 5096.58
because it's sitting there absorbing

5094.75 --> 5100.27
this stress and basically telling you to

5096.58 --> 5104.73
piss off and wait until the the place is

5100.27 --> 5108.160000000001
fixed until it's absorbed because cats I

5104.73 --> 5110.139999999999
don't know they they can transform it

5108.16 --> 5115.08
into something good that they have

5110.14 --> 5118.2300000000005
benefit from and so does everybody else

5115.08 --> 5121.53
and it's real and a lot of cats have

5118.23 --> 5124.11
done that is part of the reason why they

5121.53 --> 5126.5599999999995
typically get in your way when you're

5124.11 --> 5130.0199999999995
stressing out they're suddenly gonna

5126.56 --> 5131.31
[ __ ] and lay down on your keyboard right

5130.02 --> 5134.070000000001
in the middle of while you're doing

5131.31 --> 5151.080000000001
something because it's like absorbing

5134.07 --> 5153.33
that stress yeah but they do that they

5151.08 --> 5157.23
have this weird energy transform and

5153.33 --> 5158.88
crushin and I guess partially the reason

5157.23 --> 5162.33
why I've always loved cats because they

5158.88 --> 5172.32
help against stress acutely literally

5162.33 --> 5175.4
the energy and they some cats also yeah

5172.32 --> 5178.349999999999
I didn't know if you if you're really

5175.4 --> 5181.129999999999
bond with them properly and get to know

5178.35 --> 5186.09
them like let them know that they are

5181.13 --> 5189.0
that they are allowed to ascend like to

5186.09 --> 5190.68
be more than just a cat that you really

5189.0 --> 5193.98
have that you're like family

5190.68 --> 5197.1900000000005
then cats can have amazing senses and

5193.98 --> 5199.669999999999
even pick up like spirits and stuff and

5197.19 --> 5199.669999999999
entities

5204.96 --> 5210.39
it was weird my old cat passed away and

5208.44 --> 5216.0599999999995
fortunately a couple of years ago right

5210.39 --> 5217.860000000001
in this room she well I I was with her

5216.06 --> 5218.6990000000005
when she was born and I was with her

5217.86 --> 5221.849999999999
when she died

5218.699 --> 5225.659
my cat my I call her my familiar because

5221.85 --> 5230.31
just yeah I still miss her

5225.659 --> 5233.04
but it was weird she could pick up like

5230.31 --> 5235.679
dark entities like spirits when they

5233.04 --> 5238.14
trying to get to somebody it's not

5235.679 --> 5242.64
nothing material and the weird thing is

5238.14 --> 5245.39
that she would get a look of like she

5242.64 --> 5248.219
could and she would get nervous of that

5245.39 --> 5250.2300000000005
she wouldn't like go berserk or some

5248.219 --> 5253.05
cats like go berserk when like an evil

5250.23 --> 5255.718999999999
spirit comes in you know this is an evil

5253.05 --> 5257.76
spirit comes when something when energy

5255.719 --> 5261.15
just is something wrong

5257.76 --> 5263.9400000000005
and some cats like to suddenly go you

5261.15 --> 5266.929
know that typically happens well my cat

5263.94 --> 5272.009999999999
didn't do that but she would get like

5266.929 --> 5274.07
like something there's something wrong

5272.01 --> 5274.070000000001
here

5281.239 --> 5288.629999999999
although she had plenty of moments when

5284.4 --> 5293.388999999999
she would typically get like go cat

5288.63 --> 5296.28
berserk and just like crawl around like

5293.389 --> 5299.099
run crawling all over the place and just

5296.28 --> 5302.969
I can't even go born one going jump

5299.099 --> 5306.360000000001
around this [ __ ] yeah cats cats do that

5302.969 --> 5317.639
every now and then you'd like to get rid

5306.36 --> 5323.478999999999
of this plastic energy stallion on 8012

5317.639 --> 5323.479
isn't a group of cats called a gang

5327.51 --> 5332.39
I don't know not sure

5365.15 --> 5378.4
like a clowder I've never heard of that

5371.65 --> 5378.4
cloud er a clowder of cats huh

5380.229 --> 5388.709
oh wow

5401.75 --> 5409.25
and the litter of kittens is also called

5405.17 --> 5411.62
a Kindle funny that's so weird

5409.25 --> 5412.25
I've never heard that word before in my

5411.62 --> 5419.349999999999
life

5412.25 --> 5421.67
clowder so is it like a cloud of cats I

5419.35 --> 5424.18
wait a sudden word where does it even

5421.67 --> 5424.18
come from

5439.26 --> 5446.58
huh okay apparently it's from early 19th

5443.55 --> 5456.78
century English a combination of the

5446.58 --> 5467.69
word clutter and clot all right so it's

5456.78 --> 5477.09
a fairly recent word right anyway yeah

5467.69 --> 5479.7
cats they're awesome all right so I'm

5477.09 --> 5481.89
gonna round out to show guys I hope you
