544.64 --> 549.1999999999999
Ages no no they did

550.079 --> 559.079
not now here's a topic did Dragon

554.36 --> 563.44
Legends in the Middle Ages give rise to

559.079 --> 564.4399999999999
the modernist Evolution based dinosaur

563.44 --> 566.12
bone

564.44 --> 568.36
claim

566.12 --> 572.2
yeah how about

568.36 --> 574.2
that yeah rerouting popular

572.2 --> 577.2
myths

574.2 --> 577.2
toy

580.92 --> 587.92
yeah I look back to my normal happy

584.839 --> 593.0790000000001
healthy happy self

587.92 --> 596.519
okay yeah I mean I am kind of healthy

593.079 --> 601.04
sure yeah and toon yeah yeah there were

596.519 --> 604.8
no bones found

601.04 --> 606.7199999999999
before the 18th century at all despite

604.8 --> 609.8389999999999
there being plenty of

606.72 --> 614.0
excavations even in the 17th century and

609.839 --> 616.8000000000001
before that even in the Middle Ages yeah

614.0 --> 618.8
no no dragon bones no dinosaur bones

616.8 --> 623.079
because they didn't exist yet because

618.8 --> 623.079
they weren't made up yet

625.32 --> 630.72
ah so I think dragons exist oh did I say

628.6 --> 633.36
dragons exist assisted you're starting

630.72 --> 635.8000000000001
off just great aren't

633.36 --> 638.92
you no I get the feeling this is not

635.8 --> 638.92
going to last very long

639.32 --> 644.519
toony why put them there because it's

642.8 --> 646.04
the new

644.519 --> 650.24
thing

646.04 --> 651.3199999999999
yeah dragon bone workshops ground up

650.24 --> 654.8
chicken

651.32 --> 657.72
bones lots of money

654.8 --> 659.8389999999999
investments from industrialists and

657.72 --> 663.12
nobility you

659.839 --> 666.639
huge amount of money being poured into

663.12 --> 669.44
the rewriting of culture a parallel

666.639 --> 675.5600000000001
constructed alternative history based on

669.44 --> 677.0790000000001
Evolution instead of creation yeah huge

675.56 --> 679.56
Investments

677.079 --> 683.04
huge

679.56 --> 687.3599999999999
Smithsonian big big organization lots of

683.04 --> 689.88
money yeah lots of connections also very

687.36 --> 693.72
convenient way to obstruct

689.88 --> 695.32
construction projects to just stop them

693.72 --> 697.6
from happening if they weren't

695.32 --> 701.36
convenient or if they weren't of the

697.6 --> 703.16
right group yeah nice way to break up

701.36 --> 704.72
companies like oh you wanted to build a

703.16 --> 707.16
building there oh no you can't oh we

704.72 --> 709.8000000000001
found some we found a dinosaur there oh

707.16 --> 713.04
this is really important so we're going

709.8 --> 715.4399999999999
to delay your construction now so that

713.04 --> 718.4399999999999
your company goes bust and then there is

715.44 --> 719.839
no more company yeah oh you're so

718.44 --> 723.1600000000001
confused oh

719.839 --> 727.36
oh yeah they definitely dug up

723.16 --> 727.36
bones yeah after they put them

730.04 --> 739.959
there yeah it's a fraud to it's a fraud

735.199 --> 742.3199999999999
all of it there is no dinosaur bones

739.959 --> 746.3599999999999
it's a

742.32 --> 749.88
fraud only started suddenly finding them

746.36 --> 752.6
everywhere a very specific point in time

749.88 --> 755.32
after archaeology and excavation had

752.6 --> 758.24
already been been a wellestablished

755.32 --> 762.88
discipline for

758.24 --> 766.519
centuries in order to like Trace back

762.88 --> 768.639
lineages location claims all that very

766.519 --> 770.24
important to the nobility yeah

768.639 --> 772.44
archaeology very important to the

770.24 --> 775.519
nobility to establish claims over

772.44 --> 778.1990000000001
regions and all that yeah yeah yeah and

775.519 --> 780.92
then suddenly oh Evolution Theory

778.199 --> 784.0
Darwinism oh this is so interesting oh

780.92 --> 786.3199999999999
we we found the real Origins oh oh look

784.0 --> 788.48
oh we found all these dinosaur bones all

786.32 --> 789.5600000000001
of a sudden everywhere oh yes all of a

788.48 --> 793.16
sudden

789.56 --> 800.3199999999999
now out of nowhere they suddenly start

793.16 --> 800.3199999999999
popping up oh yeah yes yes it's a fraud

801.88 --> 807.279
toon I know you're very confused cuz

805.16 --> 811.12
you're a dumbass and you refuse to

807.279 --> 811.12
listen to reason when you hear it

814.88 --> 819.24
hello soul juner in a war

825.399 --> 832.48

nice when who put them there

840.44 --> 845.1990000000001
Smithsonian organization mostly and they

843.279 --> 849.519
put them

845.199 --> 849.519
there right before they discover

850.0 --> 854.639
him how about other archaeology also

852.56 --> 855.5189999999999
fake did I say the other archaeology was

854.639 --> 858.639
also

855.519 --> 861.0
fake did didn't I just specifically

858.639 --> 863.48
toony do I need to kick you out are you

861.0 --> 866.519
already going [ __ ] [ __ ] on

863.48 --> 868.32
me I literally just drew in all their

866.519 --> 870.32
archaeology and now you're telling me

868.32 --> 872.72
they're fake

870.32 --> 875.279
is this are you already at the la la la

872.72 --> 879.519
la la phase

875.279 --> 879.519
already that didn't take you long did

880.279 --> 885.8389999999999
it like 10 minutes and you're already

884.36 --> 889.32
acting quite

885.839 --> 891.72
demented maybe you should just step back

889.32 --> 893.72
before you get yourself banned again

891.72 --> 897.24
because you're starting to piss me

893.72 --> 901.5600000000001
off yeah you're not asking anything

897.24 --> 903.759
politely I already explained everything

901.56 --> 907.8
that you're now asking about like you

903.759 --> 910.32
didn't hear it like you're not listening

907.8 --> 913.399
you're not following the story that I'm

910.32 --> 913.399
rolling out for

918.2 --> 921.279
[Music]

923.32 --> 931.12
you where did the idea of dragons come

927.959 --> 934.4799999999999
from very likely from extradimensional

931.12 --> 936.88
encounters from the spirit

934.48 --> 939.639
dragons Chinese are

936.88 --> 941.759
very aware of it

939.639 --> 944.639
traditionally they know they were

941.759 --> 948.839
Spirits they say like the dragons are

944.639 --> 951.12
spirits not physical creatures

948.839 --> 954.12
spirits

951.12 --> 957.079
and well very likely

954.12 --> 960.88
that those same Spirits have been

957.079 --> 963.68
witnessed or recounted told about and

960.88 --> 967.079
turned from mythology into

963.68 --> 967.079
legend in the

968.56 --> 976.319
west and since the West overall has been

971.8 --> 979.3599999999999
the much more like militant culture in

976.319 --> 982.68
ways they would have created a

979.36 --> 986.48
mythological Savage enemy out of it that

982.68 --> 988.5999999999999
everybody was like yeah one day I might

986.48 --> 992.16
defeat a dragon I'm that powerful like

988.6 --> 994.639
they used it to brag to make up combat

992.16 --> 997.7199999999999
stories with cuz that's what the people

994.639 --> 1001.5600000000001
in the west would typically do so that's

997.72 --> 1005.0790000000001
my suspicion of how dragons came into be

1001.56 --> 1006.4399999999999
it started in the East a spiritual

1005.079 --> 1009.56
creatures where they have been

1006.44 --> 1012.9200000000001
encountered by wise

1009.56 --> 1015.5999999999999
Masters then were

1012.92 --> 1019.4799999999999
mythologized

1015.6 --> 1022.16
and changed as the stories entered the

1019.48 --> 1025.679
West as it does with many things I mean

1022.16 --> 1030.199
just look at the on record stories and

1025.679 --> 1034.88
depictions of lions in the Medieval Time

1030.199 --> 1038.199
Yeah people in the west have like

1034.88 --> 1040.199
pretty weird imaginations about things

1038.199 --> 1042.76
that they don't know about and

1040.199 --> 1046.0
then they hear a

1042.76 --> 1050.84
story it inspires them then they draw

1046.0 --> 1050.84
something up that they think it is

1053.16 --> 1060.28
that's how a lot of folklore has come to

1056.88 --> 1062.679
be in the west not by people actually

1060.28 --> 1065.559
encountering it but by hearing second

1062.679 --> 1068.52
third or fourth hand stories and then

1065.559 --> 1072.84
making their own imaginary version about

1068.52 --> 1072.84
it it's what westerners tend to

1073.05 --> 1076.22
[Music]

1077.28 --> 1082.6
do yeah I no Chinese Spirit dragons are

1080.679 --> 1085.4
good creatures and

1082.6 --> 1088.559
respected yeah leave it up to westerners

1085.4 --> 1091.3600000000001
to flip that around 180 right I mean

1088.559 --> 1091.36
that's what we

1094.679 --> 1101.44
do westerners called the Chinese like

1097.84 --> 1101.4399999999998
evil Sorcerers and all

1103.24 --> 1106.96
that like a bunch of

1107.32 --> 1111.2
bigots and then of course they're going

1109.28 --> 1113.799
to flip everything around the the the

1111.2 --> 1116.039
Roman Catholics are Infamous for

1113.799 --> 1119.08
literally flipping around

1116.039 --> 1121.1589999999999
everything so they just took the

1119.08 --> 1125.08
original meanings and then turn it all

1121.159 --> 1125.0800000000002
to hell and

1126.2 --> 1129.8400000000001
evil it's what they

1131.28 --> 1136.1589999999999
do old Catholic priests do they

1134.0 --> 1138.44
translate good things and then turn them

1136.159 --> 1141.3200000000002
into hellish things to threaten

1138.44 --> 1143.76
everybody with to reinforce their own

1141.32 --> 1143.76
power

1148.69 --> 1151.809
[Music]

1155.0 --> 1162.36
position how do they manage to bury fake

1158.72 --> 1165.48
fuzzles in rock well they don't do it in

1162.36 --> 1167.7199999999998
rock they do it in

1165.48 --> 1170.72
sand

1167.72 --> 1170.72
huh

1170.96 --> 1178.88
the dragon the uh the bones the

1176.12 --> 1180.76
supposed Bones from dinosaurs yet they

1178.88 --> 1183.88
don't find them in

1180.76 --> 1187.24
rock they find them in

1183.88 --> 1191.1200000000001
dirt every time they find them in dirt

1187.24 --> 1194.039
just look at every supposed excavation

1191.12 --> 1197.0
of dinosaur bones it's always in dirt

1194.039 --> 1199.799
it's never in rock the only thing you

1197.0 --> 1201.72
find in rock are trill

1199.799 --> 1205.44
bites and

1201.72 --> 1208.32
other like shell type

1205.44 --> 1210.52
creatures yeah no dragon

1208.32 --> 1212.6399999999999
bones I keep calling them Dragon no

1210.52 --> 1215.6399999999999
dinosaur bones they always find them in

1212.64 --> 1215.64
dirt

1220.77 --> 1223.8799999999999
[Music]

1227.64 --> 1232.64
yeah and even if you would find them in

1229.919 --> 1234.2800000000002
rock it's not hard to basically just

1232.64 --> 1239.5590000000002
take those types of

1234.28 --> 1241.9189999999999
Bones and then petrify them like put

1239.559 --> 1243.44
them in dirt and like actively petrify

1241.919 --> 1246.64
them

1243.44 --> 1251.28
petrification can happen very

1246.64 --> 1253.8400000000001
rapidly and it completely destroys any

1251.28 --> 1256.48
traces of things that you can use to

1253.84 --> 1260.6
determine the

1256.48 --> 1260.6
age so it's very convenient

1277.32 --> 1282.9189999999999
why you're breathing dragons are

1280.08 --> 1285.36
badass yeah I know I mean I love Dragon

1282.919 --> 1287.96
Fantasy Dragons love Dungeons and

1285.36 --> 1290.52
Dragons dragons I mean I'm all about the

1287.96 --> 1290.52
dragons

1291.64 --> 1296.1200000000001
dud

1293.24 --> 1299.279

1296.12 --> 1300.6789999999999
Dragon book yeah I got a dragon book of

1299.279 --> 1304.559
my

1300.679 --> 1304.5590000000002
own it's

1304.919 --> 1311.44
awesome it's called the

1307.6 --> 1316.48
draconomicon and it is a freaking here

1311.44 --> 1320.52
you want to look at like the organs of a

1316.48 --> 1320.52
dragon yeah

1323.76 --> 1330.799
want to look Dragon

1327.2 --> 1332.679
religions or or just like an amazing

1330.799 --> 1335.1589999999999
collection of

1332.679 --> 1338.5590000000002
paintings of

1335.159 --> 1340.4
dragons and like their design what

1338.559 --> 1342.84
they're typically like because there are

1340.4 --> 1346.679
like distinct different types of dragons

1342.84 --> 1347.52
that have distinct features of what they

1346.679 --> 1351.3600000000001
look

1347.52 --> 1355.2
like like here's a golden

1351.36 --> 1357.799
dragon which is the Chinese

1355.2 --> 1361.2
version like dungeon dragons made a very

1357.799 --> 1363.48
clear distinction between European

1361.2 --> 1366.159
dragons and Asian

1363.48 --> 1368.96
dragons which they divided into

1366.159 --> 1371.48
chromatic dragons and metallic dragons

1368.96 --> 1374.559
metallic dragons are good chromatic

1371.48 --> 1378.52
dragons are evil romantic dragons are

1374.559 --> 1380.9189999999999
European style they look like European

1378.52 --> 1385.32
style dragons very typical while the

1380.919 --> 1385.3200000000002
metallic dragons are much more

1388.44 --> 1391.72
Eastern it's

1394.2 --> 1399.2
awesome more nice pictures it's full of

1397.0 --> 1401.88
pictures but I mean nothing really

1399.2 --> 1403.679
matches the the front which is just

1401.88 --> 1406.72
absolutely

1403.679 --> 1409.76
gorgeous it's just

1406.72 --> 1411.279
amazing wrong picture nothing nothing

1409.76 --> 1415.12
more beautiful than

1411.279 --> 1418.0
a classic red

1415.12 --> 1422.36
dragon which by the way is the smog

1418.0 --> 1426.32
Dragon smog is a big red dragon a

1422.36 --> 1426.32
colossal the biggest sword

1432.88 --> 1439.4
possible I'm so happy to have this book

1435.72 --> 1442.1200000000001
because it's just [ __ ] awesome

1439.4 --> 1444.52
just for the pictures it's awesome but

1442.12 --> 1445.9599999999998
if you want to have any expansion on any

1444.52 --> 1449.9189999999999
Dragon

1445.96 --> 1454.48
theme within the game then this is the

1449.919 --> 1454.48
book to do it look here is

1454.96 --> 1463.52
a running and jumping cycle of dragon

1459.679 --> 1463.52
though I just made

1465.679 --> 1470.3600000000001
this this is awesome

1472.72 --> 1476.6000000000001
Dragon

1473.88 --> 1480.3990000000001
swimming Dragon

1476.6 --> 1480.399
borrowing what that looks

1482.039 --> 1485.64
like this is

1489.919 --> 1497.3200000000002
epic external armor like dragons can

1494.32 --> 1500.32
actually wear armor on top of their

1497.32 --> 1500.32
armor

1501.12 --> 1506.52
it's just awesome I'm so happy I got

1504.279 --> 1506.52
this

1509.08 --> 1515.6399999999999
book like they're my two favorite

1512.76 --> 1518.2
books it's the draconomicon and the

1515.64 --> 1520.2
manual of the PLS and I feel very lucky

1518.2 --> 1523.32
that I got

1520.2 --> 1525.799
those like the manual of dragons and the

1523.32 --> 1529.36
manual of the

1525.799 --> 1531.84
dimensions what more would have any

1529.36 --> 1531.84
gamer

1533.96 --> 1539.0
want that's why I rewrote a whole bunch

1536.52 --> 1539.0
of this

1540.38 --> 1543.7990000000002
[Music]

1542.039 --> 1546.799
stuff

1543.799 --> 1546.799
find

1557.24 --> 1561.88

1564.039 --> 1570.08
Abyss

else see the gray waste of

1583.32 --> 1586.96

1612.96 --> 1616.799
cute

1614.88 --> 1621.2
or

1616.799 --> 1623.44
Arcadia just take notice of those shapes

1621.2 --> 1626.32
eh yeah that's why it's called the

1623.44 --> 1628.559
manual of the PLS and not the manual of

1626.32 --> 1628.559
the

1641.0 --> 1644.0
Globes

1645.84 --> 1650.1589999999999
yeah anyway

1657.64 --> 1664.279
is that the actually no g go that book

1660.96 --> 1667.32
that he showed yesterday was the silly

1664.279 --> 1667.32
kids version of

1674.48 --> 1681.2
it now this is the official the Dungeons

1678.48 --> 1681.2
and Dragons

1681.36 --> 1689.36
3.5 draconomicon book I'm very happy to

1685.64 --> 1691.679
have it I mean that thing is kind of

1689.36 --> 1691.6789999999999
rare

1697.88 --> 1701.0690000000002
[Music]

1707.12 --> 1710.6
now

1708.919 --> 1713.279
that's ancient wisdom right there well

1710.6 --> 1717.08
that's how I see it it's Dungeons and

1713.279 --> 1720.12
Dragons grafted in huge amounts of

1717.08 --> 1723.36
Legend they collected Legends and

1720.12 --> 1726.4799999999998
mythologies from around the world and

1723.36 --> 1728.32
then all put it in their

1726.48 --> 1731.84
game they

1728.32 --> 1734.96
gamified like the entirety of Mythology

1731.84 --> 1737.6399999999999
and Legend like all of it all over the

1734.96 --> 1740.96
world from all cultures like the monster

1737.64 --> 1743.6000000000001
manuals are full of like creatures that

1740.96 --> 1747.32
are literally referenced in

1743.6 --> 1747.32
mythologies all over the

1747.84 --> 1753.1999999999998
place and there's even like more

1750.799 --> 1757.0
specialist books for

1753.2 --> 1760.44
that so you can literally like play out

1757.0 --> 1762.799
in eastern mythology very specific

1760.44 --> 1765.96
regions it's

1762.799 --> 1768.1589999999999
fascinating like so much was made for

1765.96 --> 1771.48
Dungeons and Dragons especially around 3

1768.159 --> 1774.0800000000002
.5 now they all moved on and they

1771.48 --> 1776.559
basically demythologized things and made

1774.08 --> 1779.6399999999999
it more computer game

1776.559 --> 1781.84
like for the sakes of uniformity instead

1779.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
of

1786.76 --> 1791.799
diversity and I mean the new dungeons

1789.88 --> 1794.3990000000001
dragons does

1791.799 --> 1797.039
work it's

1794.399 --> 1799.799
just

1797.039 --> 1801.96
it's

1799.799 --> 1804.08
it's all focused at people with less

1801.96 --> 1807.919
attention

1804.08 --> 1810.799
span gamer types to get a broader Market

1807.919 --> 1814.1200000000001
when it never was that dungeon rangs was

1810.799 --> 1818.679
always for the weirdo nerd intelligent

1814.12 --> 1821.4799999999998
guys that had the faculties to deal with

1818.679 --> 1824.2
it that was the entire point of it it's

1821.48 --> 1824.2
a nerd

1826.96 --> 1829.96
sport

1834.519 --> 1837.919
hello clutch by way good to see

1845.48 --> 1851.039
you yeah talking about dunge and

1848.24 --> 1853.0
Dragons I really want to start my group

1851.039 --> 1855.919
back up and I'm going to try to contact

1853.0 --> 1859.32
them see if I can get them back together

1855.919 --> 1862.0800000000002
I really hope I will be able to cuz we

1859.32 --> 1866.279
need to get back

1862.08 --> 1867.96
together I really miss him and like the

1866.279 --> 1870.799
story needs to

1867.96 --> 1873.679
continue we've done it 5 years and

1870.799 --> 1878.0
there's like another 10 years worth of

1873.679 --> 1878.0
material left to be

1886.919 --> 1889.919
explored

1901.399 --> 1903.6
all

1911.519 --> 1919.84
right how many were in my group

1916.84 --> 1919.84
uh

1930.24 --> 1933.679
four which is

1933.96 --> 1939.799
ideal if it if it's five it it already

1937.32 --> 1939.799
becomes

1942.88 --> 1949.8400000000001
chaotic I miss those guys yeah a

1946.84 --> 1949.84
lot

1954.12 --> 1961.1589999999999
I mean I saw them like every single week

1957.36 --> 1961.1589999999999
for five years every

1964.399 --> 1970.0
weekend also I think that I at this

1967.679 --> 1973.679
point I I would make a lot better of a

1970.0 --> 1976.44
game master really I'm just because I

1973.679 --> 1978.76
was doing all that and still kind of

1976.44 --> 1981.519
being having

1978.76 --> 1986.399
issues having many

1981.519 --> 1989.519
issues like I know I do a way better job

1986.399 --> 1993.36
now I'd be more focused during the game

1989.519 --> 1993.36
as well without concentration

2003.159 --> 2008.0
problems and we've come pretty far as

2005.72 --> 2012.519
well I mean I already explained this

2008.0 --> 2015.279
like in the middle of a giant

2012.519 --> 2018.84
cutscene a transitional

2015.279 --> 2018.84
phase to the

2019.24 --> 2022.96
next chapter

2024.399 --> 2030.1999999999998
basically it's like the first like the

2027.799 --> 2033.8799999999999
intro yes it's not really but the first

2030.2 --> 2037.279
chapter is basically now rounding

2033.88 --> 2040.1200000000001
out it's crazy just five years for one

2037.279 --> 2043.0
freaking chapter and there's like at

2040.12 --> 2043.0
least two more

2043.399 --> 2049.24
chapters with endless possibilities of

2046.399 --> 2051.0
getting distracted and wandering off

2049.24 --> 2054.56
doing something completely different

2051.0 --> 2056.079
which these guys really like to do and I

2054.56 --> 2057.919
don't blame him because it's like one of

2056.079 --> 2060.2400000000002
the most awesome things ever to do that

2057.919 --> 2062.56
it's like yeah you're on a mission sort

2060.24 --> 2066.0789999999997
of and then you get

2062.56 --> 2070.48
sidetracked and you kind of Wonder

2066.079 --> 2072.8790000000004
around in the side track

2070.48 --> 2076.0
like specifically when there is no

2072.879 --> 2077.839
direct urgency you kind of wander around

2076.0 --> 2080.24
in the Sidetrack and that is like

2077.839 --> 2081.96
glorious because it feels like you're in

2080.24 --> 2083.6789999999996
another dimension and you're like you

2081.96 --> 2086.879
got all the time in the world it's

2083.679 --> 2088.48
awesome I totally get it and you're like

2086.879 --> 2091.5989999999997
I just want to dig in the ground right

2088.48 --> 2094.52
here and see what I find like or just

2091.599 --> 2096.2400000000002
want to like look around what kind of

2094.52 --> 2098.92
creature do I come into like is there

2096.24 --> 2102.0
some kind of resource here is there some

2098.92 --> 2105.28
kind of food here or like you just want

2102.0 --> 2107.48
to like micro explore the virtual world

2105.28 --> 2109.4
there and it's the most epic thing you

2107.48 --> 2111.56
could ever do with a group if you're

2109.4 --> 2114.88
good

2111.56 --> 2114.88
attuned with each

2122.0 --> 2128.2
other that's a big

2124.92 --> 2130.44
game could be bigger there is game out

2128.2 --> 2133.48
there that have played a campaign for

2130.44 --> 2136.2000000000003
like 25

2133.48 --> 2138.88
years where their characters reach epic

2136.2 --> 2141.56
levels starting at level one and that's

2138.88 --> 2141.56
insane

2142.079 --> 2146.32
though but I mean that's called

2148.079 --> 2154.319
dedication like those friends are like

2154.64 --> 2159.72
more more those characters that and

2157.76 --> 2162.44
they're actual people when they are with

2159.72 --> 2164.68
each other like they've had that

2162.44 --> 2167.2000000000003
character those characters for so damn

2164.68 --> 2169.52
long among each other that they don't

2167.2 --> 2172.0
even know each other outside of those

2169.52 --> 2172.0
characters

2172.31 --> 2175.429

2183.88 --> 2191.44
anymore yo automatic parsnip you got a

2186.92 --> 2193.56
point with your weird random

2191.44 --> 2197.4
comments you got a

2193.56 --> 2197.4
point you just in the

2197.42 --> 2200.57
[Music]

2212.93 --> 2217.56
[Music]

2216.52 --> 2220.63
way

2217.56 --> 2220.63
[Music]

2222.839 --> 2225.839
so let me show The

2226.119 --> 2231.28
Village what those Gamers have been

2228.56 --> 2235.16
playing in they basically helped create

2231.28 --> 2237.2400000000002
this Village the ending of a river right

2235.16 --> 2242.2799999999997
next to a mountain mountain and the

2237.24 --> 2242.2799999999997
mountain is a a dwarfen settlement an

2244.2 --> 2250.56
outpost is this

2246.16 --> 2250.56
more zoom that version of

2254.359 --> 2257.359
it

2260.359 --> 2269.44
right now south of that which they also

2265.64 --> 2269.44
visited is Frost

2270.68 --> 2277.7599999999998
Lauren spent about one and a half year

2274.24 --> 2280.72
in the real world time gaming over there

2277.76 --> 2286.0
just all giant ice

2280.72 --> 2288.1099999999997
cap just one giant ice cap Scape on a on

2286.0 --> 2291.26
the other side of a huge

2288.11 --> 2291.26
[Music]

2293.04 --> 2297.319
mountain hey there's the

2296.0 --> 2300.72
[Music]

2297.319 --> 2300.72
door what's

2300.76 --> 2309.44
this what is this where's the

2305.48 --> 2309.44
picture damn it

2315.4 --> 2318.52
wait this is all character

2318.68 --> 2322.96
sheets where the [ __ ] is hammers

2324.92 --> 2330.0
Landing slightly misor that

2332.119 --> 2338.56
sucks all right and here is an entire

2335.599 --> 2340.4
continent that's on the other side of

2338.56 --> 2344.48
the ocean the old

2340.4 --> 2347.0
world is where they come from it's all

2344.48 --> 2349.44
human this is the place that's basically

2347.0 --> 2350.44
colonizing the new world is where it's

2349.44 --> 2353.96
taking

2350.44 --> 2357.44
place but these these are like kingdoms

2353.96 --> 2360.92
that are at war with each other as well

2357.44 --> 2360.92
making things a little bit more

2362.56 --> 2369.359
complicated how the hell is that this is

2365.72 --> 2369.359
not good

2388.28 --> 2394.5600000000004
okay don't know what the [ __ ] happened

2390.599 --> 2396.319
to Hammer's Landing but it's not in its

2394.56 --> 2399.319
proper

2396.319 --> 2399.319
place

2416.68 --> 2422.5989999999997
annoying I want a larger map of that

2419.96 --> 2426.76
region that I just show

2422.599 --> 2429.319
you there you go even more zoomed out

2426.76 --> 2432.2000000000003
version

2429.319 --> 2435.2799999999997
you can see it's quite the landscape and

2432.2 --> 2439.56
this is just still a fragment of that

2435.28 --> 2443.5600000000004
entire continent which is massive it all

2439.56 --> 2446.72
is all developed I developed this entire

2443.56 --> 2449.24
world some parts are still a mystery

2446.72 --> 2451.48
though as in like yeah I'll get to it

2449.24 --> 2454.2
when the players get to it but I already

2451.48 --> 2456.0
got ideas about like what it's like

2454.2 --> 2458.64
there's an entire place where it's

2456.0 --> 2461.68
basically all baren

2458.64 --> 2465.0
weird rockish area and it's like there's

2461.68 --> 2467.359
no creatures there and nobody knows why

2465.0 --> 2471.64
but nobody goes

2467.359 --> 2471.64
there got a nice idea for

2474.0 --> 2477.4
it all right

2480.44 --> 2486.7200000000003
anyway it's what it

2483.48 --> 2491.28
is a lot of hard work gone into that

2486.72 --> 2493.9599999999996
yeah decently artw work I mean a game

2491.28 --> 2496.7200000000003
master really doesn't have a life that's

2493.96 --> 2498.96
a fact no good game master actually has

2496.72 --> 2500.9599999999996
a life if they have a life they're going

2498.96 --> 2503.64
to suck as a game

2500.96 --> 2507.48
master that's just a fact I know that

2503.64 --> 2511.0
from game Masters as I've

2507.48 --> 2514.44
had when I had like a very longstanding

2511.0 --> 2517.359
DD group that game master didn't have a

2514.44 --> 2519.56
life either but because of that we we

2517.359 --> 2521.119
had a great game that everybody always

2519.56 --> 2524.839
looked forward to a

2521.119 --> 2524.839
lot it lasted

2525.56 --> 2529.4
like six years or

2535.079 --> 2538.96
something all right lots of hard work

2537.56 --> 2540.599
going into that yeah and it's still

2538.96 --> 2543.559
there the world is

2540.599 --> 2545.92
there I actually want to turn it into a

2543.559 --> 2549.92
video game at some

2545.92 --> 2549.92
point like that's ever going to

2550.0 --> 2555.68
happen but it would make like a really

2553.04 --> 2558.16
great Video Game World it really would

2555.68 --> 2561.7999999999997
it would be absolutely like everybody

2558.16 --> 2564.72
would be like yes oh yes [ __ ]

2561.8 --> 2568.28
yeah cuz it's great it's

2564.72 --> 2568.2799999999997
like a new

2569.04 --> 2572.04
world

2572.48 --> 2578.28
like it really is like an an exploration

2576.599 --> 2581.3590000000004
phase you could call

2578.28 --> 2584.4
this a DND D style

2581.359 --> 2586.4
reimagining of Europe colonizing the

2584.4 --> 2589.88
United States

2586.4 --> 2593.359
Americas with all the Shady stuff right

2589.88 --> 2596.04
because I mean it was already colonized

2593.359 --> 2599.0
obviously and so is

2596.04 --> 2601.8
this so it's really up to the players as

2599.0 --> 2605.599
to how they're going to do

2601.8 --> 2607.559
it are they going to be Spanish about it

2605.599 --> 2610.8
or are they going to be Dutch about it

2607.559 --> 2613.44
right that's a thing like that's a thing

2610.8 --> 2616.04
and it's an option system within this

2613.44 --> 2618.92
game there these different types of

2616.04 --> 2620.359
approaches how are you going to do it

2618.92 --> 2622.7200000000003
are you going to make friends with the

2620.359 --> 2625.04
locals or are you going to war on

2622.72 --> 2627.24
them I mean they're already Waring on

2625.04 --> 2627.24
each

2629.44 --> 2638.599
other right it's basically men versus

2634.839 --> 2640.24
elves dwarves and Orcs

2638.599 --> 2642.6400000000003
cuz the elves dwarves and Orcs are the

2640.24 --> 2644.52
ones that are living there for a long

2642.64 --> 2646.7599999999998
time and they've been added with each

2644.52 --> 2650.359
other for a long

2646.76 --> 2654.6800000000003
time and then the men come in so that's

2650.359 --> 2657.72
the interesting overall scenario of

2654.68 --> 2660.48
it and the men have their issues they

2657.72 --> 2663.68
they've been on one continent pretty

2660.48 --> 2665.68
much exclusively humans and they have

2663.68 --> 2667.8799999999997
their own issues and their secret

2665.68 --> 2670.9199999999996
societies and their secret religions

2667.88 --> 2673.48
which also play it in into it into what

2670.92 --> 2676.079
is overall happening there are secret

2673.48 --> 2677.839
societies which is really fascinating to

2676.079 --> 2680.4
work with and it's interesting to the

2677.839 --> 2680.4
players as

2693.32 --> 2699.04
[Music]

2696.04 --> 2699.04
well

2699.64 --> 2706.16
longest campaign you had was four the

2702.8 --> 2708.44
weeks what four three weeks what are you

2706.16 --> 2712.04
talking about you mean four

2708.44 --> 2712.04
weeks that's not a

2716.0 --> 2725.319
campaign I mean I have standardized

2720.44 --> 2725.319
campaigns that will be

2725.72 --> 2731.3999999999996
like more

2727.48 --> 2731.4
multiple multiple game

2732.48 --> 2739.319
sessions which by the way take place in

2735.16 --> 2739.319
this world just for the

2739.8 --> 2746.92
record but they're very specific the

2744.52 --> 2750.68
uh

2746.92 --> 2753.8
the the minds of iron

2750.68 --> 2756.24
flood like I really developed that fully

2753.8 --> 2760.48
it's like fully written out anybody

2756.24 --> 2760.4799999999996
could just grab grab it and then play

2761.119 --> 2765.31
it I think I should because it has a lot

2763.92 --> 2768.44
of pictures that

2765.31 --> 2768.44
[Music]

2785.92 --> 2790.2400000000002
one

2787.839 --> 2790.24
there it

2796.72 --> 2803.68
is I don't know where the hell it is the

2800.4 --> 2806.88
paper stacks and

2803.68 --> 2810.8799999999997
[ __ ] all right I need some coffee and

2806.88 --> 2810.88
the Illuminati CU I'll be right

2815.839 --> 2818.839
back

2845.839 --> 2848.839
for

2875.839 --> 2878.839
for

2891.599 --> 2894.52
all right

2905.76 --> 2908.76
anyway

2910.559 --> 2915.559
no star for on

2912.8 --> 2918.4
map why what everything has to be about

2915.559 --> 2918.4
freaking star

2919.24 --> 2925.16
fors

2921.92 --> 2928.0
no maybe they don't have star fors in my

2925.16 --> 2931.64
world ever considered that maybe my

2928.0 --> 2934.119
world is not just a recycled simulacrum

2931.64 --> 2937.04
of this physical real world maybe it

2934.119 --> 2939.359
just doesn't have certain things in it

2937.04 --> 2942.64
ever consider

2939.359 --> 2945.2
that you don't always have to like make

2942.64 --> 2950.0789999999997
some kind of transmutated copy of the

2945.2 --> 2950.0789999999997
real world every time you make a virtual

2957.839 --> 2968.72
world c word jerks okay brick topper

2963.48 --> 2968.72
Yeah well yeah some DND groups

2969.88 --> 2972.88
suck

2972.96 --> 2976.96
leave then you just have to

2980.0 --> 2985.799
leave I mean the players in my game

2982.799 --> 2988.04
could literally be whatever they wanted

2985.799 --> 2991.04
they got quite weird with

2988.04 --> 2994.96
it like quite

2991.04 --> 2998.599
weird right one guy was like a half elf

2994.96 --> 3001.0
half orc Ranger and it may was like I

2998.599 --> 3003.599
even made that into a big part of like

3001.0 --> 3006.4
the story development that it actually

3003.599 --> 3009.04
had a per purpose that he was like that

3006.4 --> 3009.04
another one

3010.28 --> 3020.2000000000003
was a priest of party female dwarf who

3016.559 --> 3022.799
was quite strong like a fighter priest

3020.2 --> 3026.839
female

3022.799 --> 3028.839
dwarf awesome character though like kind

3026.839 --> 3030.44
of too strong it was like it just worked

3028.839 --> 3032.52
too

3030.44 --> 3035.88
well

3032.52 --> 3038.119
uh a halfling

3035.88 --> 3041.28
Bard

3038.119 --> 3043.2400000000002
and yeah and another character but that

3041.28 --> 3044.96
person just kept switching characters

3043.24 --> 3049.1189999999997
kept retiring which is

3044.96 --> 3052.28
annoying originally there was like an an

3049.119 --> 3055.7200000000003
elf Shadow Dancer who was like really

3052.28 --> 3057.3190000000004
awkward and weird but hilarious he still

3055.72 --> 3059.7599999999998
like the characters still hang around

3057.319 --> 3063.96
but the player just went

3059.76 --> 3067.76
away he's like a guy from Bulgaria or

3063.96 --> 3069.92
something and he's like he was living in

3067.76 --> 3074.2000000000003
the Netherlands for years but then he

3069.92 --> 3076.559
like moved back and so the the character

3074.2 --> 3078.72
retired at the other one it was like one

3076.559 --> 3081.079
was a

3078.72 --> 3082.0789999999997
broccoli literally called broccoli who

3081.079 --> 3085.559
was like

3082.079 --> 3091.119
a half tree

3085.559 --> 3095.559
man basically an animated tree

3091.119 --> 3095.559
creature then that figure

3095.68 --> 3100.7599999999998
retired and then she took like a fairy

3099.599 --> 3104.599
like

3100.76 --> 3106.0400000000004
h i mean they were they were pretty cool

3104.599 --> 3108.119
characters to play with it's just

3106.04 --> 3110.44
annoying when a player keeps retiring

3108.119 --> 3114.599
their character like in the middle of a

3110.44 --> 3114.599
campaign yeah Brock Lee that's

3115.52 --> 3119.52
right

3118.079 --> 3123.559
that's exactly what they were called

3119.52 --> 3123.559
Rich G hello good to see

3132.48 --> 3140.0
you would you ever get the beard sh is

3136.2 --> 3140.0
really pretty

3145.52 --> 3148.52
no

3158.68 --> 3160.8799999999997
all

3161.96 --> 3167.04
right oh yeah I almost forgot they also

3165.68 --> 3170.1189999999997
had

3167.04 --> 3172.0
a dwarf wizard they were all about the

3170.119 --> 3175.0
Dwarfs with these

3172.0 --> 3178.64
guys like a dwarf wizard who was like a

3175.0 --> 3181.24
freaking genius but eccentric and then

3178.64 --> 3183.4
he turned out to be like the nephew of

3181.24 --> 3183.3999999999996
the

3184.28 --> 3190.1600000000003
emperor and a red dragon fell in love

3188.2 --> 3193.0789999999997
with him and they kind of hung around

3190.16 --> 3195.839
the player left and then they

3193.079 --> 3197.8390000000004
like basically the character just went

3195.839 --> 3199.72
off with a red dragon that fell in love

3197.839 --> 3202.2
with her with him

3199.72 --> 3206.5989999999997
and and then he became like a side

3202.2 --> 3209.24
character that pops up like a sidetrack

3206.599 --> 3209.2400000000002
gandal

3213.48 --> 3218.44
figure you didn't like rings of power

3216.24 --> 3221.16
because they didn't give dwarf females

3218.44 --> 3224.16
beards yeah that is very

3221.16 --> 3224.16
rude

3235.44 --> 3238.44
boo

3242.799 --> 3249.319
I mean they don't have men beards female

3246.64 --> 3252.72
dwarves but they do have like

3249.319 --> 3255.599
fluff it's a yeah I mean it's it's dwarf

3252.72 --> 3258.8799999999997
lore it's tol Keen how dare they I mean

3255.599 --> 3262.1600000000003
rings of power is [ __ ] dis it's it's

3258.88 --> 3265.1600000000003
an atrocity like universally agreed upon

3262.16 --> 3265.16
is like one of the

3265.359 --> 3272.0
worst movie productions of all

3269.28 --> 3274.3590000000004
time the rings that they used the rings

3272.0 --> 3275.359
of power that started it all literally

3274.359 --> 3278.92
look

3275.359 --> 3283.319
like Cracker Jack box Rings like

3278.92 --> 3285.079
literally that stupid and ugly it's the

3283.319 --> 3287.48
yeah it is an Abomination I've never

3285.079 --> 3291.96
even watched it but every

3287.48 --> 3294.119
single still shot that have been put in

3291.96 --> 3296.4
my face in relation to it just made it

3294.119 --> 3298.839
blatantly obvious like this thing is a

3296.4 --> 3298.839
[ __ ]

3298.88 --> 3306.319
Abomination they picked the worst cast

3302.72 --> 3308.68
possible the designs of it suck the

3306.319 --> 3311.52
story sucks everything about It suck is

3308.68 --> 3311.52
the Pinnacle of

3311.76 --> 3315.6800000000003
suckage else with modern

3318.319 --> 3321.319
haircuts

3325.319 --> 3328.319
evil

3329.039 --> 3332.079
I mean they they would have done better

3330.96 --> 3335.44
if they

3332.079 --> 3338.88
just made that entire series look like

3335.44 --> 3341.92
World of Warcraft or something which is

3338.88 --> 3343.52
[ __ ] ugly as [ __ ] in my opinion but I

3341.92 --> 3346.599
mean it would have been better if they

3343.52 --> 3351.0099999999998
had just done that than what what we

3346.599 --> 3352.44
ended up with it is an Abomination right

3351.01 --> 3355.1600000000003
[Music]

3352.44 --> 3357.839
anyway I don't need to care about it I'm

3355.16 --> 3361.44
never going to watch it

3357.839 --> 3361.44
I'm very happy with Lord of the

3361.839 --> 3369.68
Rings the movie the movie series and

3366.44 --> 3372.799
even The Hobbit even though it was

3369.68 --> 3375.2799999999997
ridiculously oversized was still pretty

3372.799 --> 3377.119
cool and the rest I don't need to know

3375.28 --> 3379.76
exists that never

3377.119 --> 3382.6800000000003
happened I think that everybody in the

3379.76 --> 3385.2400000000002
world that actually likes Lord of the

3382.68 --> 3387.68
Rings and Tolen can agree upon that that

3385.24 --> 3390.799
never happened

3387.68 --> 3393.839
and we all can't wait until Mandela

3390.799 --> 3396.16
effect literally erases it from

3393.839 --> 3398.7599999999998
existence I mean they should they should

3396.16 --> 3401.92
take the originals put it on a giant

3398.76 --> 3405.039
bonfire erase all the hard data go

3401.92 --> 3407.44
around the internet and literally erase

3405.039 --> 3410.1600000000003
every single trace of its of its

3407.44 --> 3412.92
existence that's what they should

3410.16 --> 3415.0389999999998
do and I'm not saying that as a joke

3412.92 --> 3417.079
they should do that they should erase it

3415.039 --> 3420.2400000000002
from existence

3417.079 --> 3420.2400000000002
and the director should

3420.559 --> 3423.559
freaking

3423.64 --> 3429.64
ended like I have no doubt in my mind

3426.24 --> 3429.64
that the director should end

3431.78 --> 3434.8390000000004
[Music]

3434.96 --> 3440.2
themselves and even the like the

3437.48 --> 3443.48
representative of the toen Institute

3440.2 --> 3445.16
that greenlighted it should resign and

3443.48 --> 3448.16
do the

3445.16 --> 3448.16
same

3458.079 --> 3461.599
really good fanmade vids and you yeah of

3460.2 --> 3464.799
course there are there's a lot of

3461.599 --> 3466.039
fan-made good stuff there is good stuff

3464.799 --> 3469.599
you don't

3466.039 --> 3471.48
need some Mega Corporation to [ __ ] it up

3469.599 --> 3475.119
for

3471.48 --> 3478.2
you cuz that's what they'll

3475.119 --> 3481.839
do but maybe people will realize now

3478.2 --> 3484.0389999999998
like oh wow Mega budget oh the big ones

3481.839 --> 3489.319
are getting involved yeah you know what

3484.039 --> 3492.559
that means bad news bad stay away from

3489.319 --> 3495.359
it it's going to be the worst ever

3492.559 --> 3498.2400000000002
that's what that means oh super huge

3495.359 --> 3503.92
budget super big Mega corporations get

3498.24 --> 3503.9199999999996
involved be wary it's going to

3504.68 --> 3508.1189999999997
suck yeah

3514.16 --> 3518.5589999999997
I

3515.64 --> 3522.5589999999997
mean I think that avatar Last Airbender

3518.559 --> 3526.0
is like probably the only exception

3522.559 --> 3527.6800000000003
but I don't even think it's that super

3526.0 --> 3531.88
huge budget or

3527.68 --> 3535.52
anything like I don't recognize a single

3531.88 --> 3537.2400000000002
actor of that series yet they were all

3535.52 --> 3540.48
great

3537.24 --> 3543.799
I think that it is actually

3540.48 --> 3543.799
like they kind

3543.92 --> 3548.96
of I mean I'm not going around and I'm

3546.4 --> 3551.559
seeing Billboards of the last air bender

3548.96 --> 3554.2400000000002
everywhere right it's not even that

3551.559 --> 3557.1600000000003
promoted which is probably why it is

3554.24 --> 3560.0389999999998
like one of the best series I've ever

3557.16 --> 3563.16
seen like it's better than the

3560.039 --> 3567.6400000000003
original if you can't believe that it

3563.16 --> 3570.96
really is I I can say that without any

3567.64 --> 3574.5989999999997
doubt whatsoever it's better than the

3570.96 --> 3577.92
original and that's miraculous and they

3574.599 --> 3580.52
didn't need a billion doll budget to

3577.92 --> 3580.52
accomplish

3595.039 --> 3598.039
that

3598.88 --> 3604.6800000000003
great Series yeah Richard I get that but

3602.28 --> 3605.6400000000003
you got to realize also that the problem

3604.68 --> 3608.359
is the

3605.64 --> 3611.2
writing sometimes a Siri can be really

3608.359 --> 3614.7599999999998
good and work but then they just don't

3611.2 --> 3617.0789999999997
know how to continue it the inspiration

3614.76 --> 3620.079
runs dry this

3617.079 --> 3620.079
happens

3624.96 --> 3627.96
tragically

3633.359 --> 3638.0789999999997
right sometimes there just isn't really

3635.88 --> 3640.6400000000003
like the original writers just don't

3638.079 --> 3643.4
know how to continue it and this is like

3640.64 --> 3645.0389999999998
a typical writer problem you have a

3643.4 --> 3648.119
great idea you it's like oh wow I'm

3645.039 --> 3650.88
going to do this and then they're like

3648.119 --> 3651.88
yeah we did it and now the next phase

3650.88 --> 3655.4
and they're

3651.88 --> 3656.96
like bail yeah bail they just don't know

3655.4 --> 3659.7200000000003
what to do they don't know how to

3656.96 --> 3665.2400000000002
continue they don't know how to top

3659.72 --> 3665.24
it that happens it's it's a a writer's

3667.559 --> 3672.119
thing it's kind of sad that it happens

3670.119 --> 3674.88
but it does

3672.119 --> 3680.2000000000003
happen and there is a solution out of it

3674.88 --> 3680.2000000000003
though and that is right really

3680.319 --> 3687.16
big right in a way where you're going to

3682.88 --> 3689.7200000000003
be like I'm writing for potentially 10

3687.16 --> 3691.44
Seasons then you can get at least five

3689.72 --> 3695.16
seasons out of it you

3691.44 --> 3696.7200000000003
see and then then you got at least five

3695.16 --> 3699.68
seasons and it's like yeah we could

3696.72 --> 3701.72
technically go on forever but I mean

3699.68 --> 3704.1189999999997
it's kind of done and then you just

3701.72 --> 3706.64
round it out quickly and that's how it

3704.119 --> 3706.6400000000003
happens a

3707.599 --> 3711.839
lot but in order to do that you need to

3710.16 --> 3713.839
scale it up it's kind of the same thing

3711.839 --> 3716.119
what I'm doing with my Dungeons and

3713.839 --> 3719.4
Dragons campaign as I said like we

3716.119 --> 3722.0
played for 5 years I have material for

3719.4 --> 3725.44
10 more

3722.0 --> 3725.44
years I really

3725.799 --> 3732.24
do but that's just how that work that's

3729.92 --> 3734.6800000000003
how you keep it alive you have to have

3732.24 --> 3739.5989999999997
more virtual things that are going to or

3734.68 --> 3742.2
could happen in order to keep the now

3739.599 --> 3744.839
going it's an interesting Dynamic how

3742.2 --> 3747.839
that works with

3744.839 --> 3747.839
inspiration

3756.0 --> 3763.64
DND D YouTube channel because

3760.799 --> 3765.44
no because if I'm going to be playing

3763.64 --> 3768.359
Dungeons and Dragons especially as a

3765.44 --> 3772.4
game master I'm going to be very picky

3768.359 --> 3772.4
about the people that I play

3774.839 --> 3777.839
with

3778.52 --> 3782.7599999999998
have I heard no I've not heard of any

3798.799 --> 3803.839
League

3801.039 --> 3807.96
okay yeah Rick Tupper there's

3803.839 --> 3811.44
other channels out there that do that

3807.96 --> 3814.839
too but alen all those groups that do

3811.44 --> 3818.2000000000003
that they're all paid for like it's a

3814.839 --> 3818.2
pay to play type of

3827.92 --> 3833.7200000000003
thing it's it's not the same as when you

3830.839 --> 3836.24
just have a group of friends that you

3833.72 --> 3838.7599999999998
play D and D with for a very long time

3836.24 --> 3841.0
the quality that comes out of that is

3838.76 --> 3842.3190000000004
good enough to actually write a real

3841.0 --> 3845.0
story about

3842.319 --> 3848.88
it if you're just going to do a pay to

3845.0 --> 3853.96
play System online you will never ever

3848.88 --> 3853.96
achieve that level of quality ever it's

3858.079 --> 3863.079
impossible right but I mean you could

3861.4 --> 3865.359
technically say like oh we're going to

3863.079 --> 3867.039
have a D and D group we're just going to

3865.359 --> 3871.64
do it it

3867.039 --> 3874.1600000000003
online that is potentially an

3871.64 --> 3876.839
option there's some people out there

3874.16 --> 3881.0389999999998
that do it the problem is they always

3876.839 --> 3885.319
eventually break up they always [ __ ]

3881.039 --> 3887.92
break up always it always happens one of

3885.319 --> 3890.319
those [ __ ] in there is like oh well

3887.92 --> 3891.52
oh suddenly I I have another job and

3890.319 --> 3894.72
can't do it

3891.52 --> 3897.599
anymore or like oh I moved to another

3894.72 --> 3899.9599999999996
country like always this [ __ ] happens

3897.599 --> 3902.559
every [ __ ] D and group always breaks

3899.96 --> 3904.2
up because it doesn't work out anymore

3902.559 --> 3909.0
every [ __ ]

3904.2 --> 3909.0
time one of the big downsides of

3909.68 --> 3915.64
DnD anyway I'm going to get my lumatic

3912.599 --> 3915.6400000000003
coffee be right

3924.64 --> 3927.64
back

4046.48 --> 4056.559
no I'm not paying for a subscription to

4052.839 --> 4056.5589999999997
anything that's not going to

4062.319 --> 4066.88
happen I'm not even paying for my

4064.76 --> 4070.3190000000004
subscription to Netflix

4066.88 --> 4073.76
so I'm just riding on somebody

a lot of Dungeons and Dragons YouTube

4109.64 --> 4112.92
channels out there I'm

4114.679 --> 4119.719
sure but I'm not really interested I'm

4117.44 --> 4122.04
not interested in some big Channel out

4119.719 --> 4125.679
there at all like

4122.04 --> 4128.44
no absolutely no only thing that I'm

4125.679 --> 4132.799
interested in is getting a group back

4128.44 --> 4136.639999999999
together that I can play with face to

4132.799 --> 4140.719
face not interested in some

4136.64 --> 4143.08
giant swollen online dragons and

4140.719 --> 4145.759
Dungeons and Dragons type Community I'm

4143.08 --> 4149.5599999999995
not interested at all especially if I if

4145.759 --> 4149.56
I have to pay for that

4154.17 --> 4159.039

4164.359 --> 4167.359

4230.79 --> 4234.069

4241.0 --> 4249.76
okay I'm just putting that in the

4245.199 --> 4249.759999999999
title what we've been talking about thus

4249.88 --> 4257.12
far what character type do I play the

4254.52 --> 4260.6
[ __ ] is that mean

4257.12 --> 4264.719
I play whatever my character design is

4260.6 --> 4264.719
whatever I can play I play all kinds of

4269.199 --> 4274.919999999999
things but to be fair one of my favorite

4271.96 --> 4274.92
combinations

4277.12 --> 4284.0
are a sorcerer that can also do a bit of

4281.08 --> 4289.159
fighting

4284.0 --> 4289.159
so I like a I like fighter

4290.75 --> 4296.239
[Music]

4293.32 --> 4298.159
Mages wizard is cool but I mean it's

4296.239 --> 4300.239
kind of a challenge you have that's a

4298.159 --> 4302.5599999999995
very specific type of character you're

4300.239 --> 4304.839999999999
much more dependent on the other players

4302.56 --> 4304.84
for

4306.8 --> 4312.159000000001
that but I mean I also love playing in

4310.28 --> 4314.239
Barbarian they're

4312.159 --> 4315.96
awesome to

4314.239 --> 4318.44
play

4315.96 --> 4320.76
but I've also loved playing

4318.44 --> 4324.239
a a

4320.76 --> 4327.76
cleric like every type of character you

4324.239 --> 4327.759999999999
can make can be pretty damn

4332.679 --> 4338.76
awesome I've played a like a a half

4335.96 --> 4341.0
Rogue half sorcerer or two which is

4338.76 --> 4343.2390000000005
great Arcane trickster is what I was

4341.0 --> 4345.88
aiming for I never really got to that

4343.239 --> 4347.599999999999
but that is awesome too like

4345.88 --> 4351.1990000000005
it's all

4347.6 --> 4351.1990000000005
awesome that's the whole

4352.44 --> 4355.53
[Music]

4357.04 --> 4362.719
point the only thing I really don't like

4359.8 --> 4367.1990000000005
is just like playing at blacku or

4362.719 --> 4370.28
something like I don't want to be evil I

4367.199 --> 4371.96
I hate it I'm sure there's some thing

4370.28 --> 4374.759999999999
you can do with it that's kind of cool

4371.96 --> 4377.04
and interesting I hate it I'd like to

4374.76 --> 4380.0
play a Paladin though and I'm very one

4377.04 --> 4384.32
of the very very few people that would

4380.0 --> 4384.32
actually committing play

4387.32 --> 4393.679
that like I would really play that I

4390.08 --> 4393.679
would play de serious

4396.32 --> 4403.599999999999
too but only if the world is doable for

4400.56 --> 4408.21
it cuz if you're like a a paladin in a

4403.6 --> 4409.400000000001
completely corrupted Realm that just

4408.21 --> 4413.36
[Music]

4409.4 --> 4416.12
sucks right and there's a lot of stupid

4413.36 --> 4419.0
ass and I'm calling them stupid ass game

4416.12 --> 4421.239
Masters that are like that they're like

4419.0 --> 4424.4
uh we hate paladins oh everybody's got

4421.239 --> 4426.48
to be corrupted I hate those game

4424.4 --> 4429.48
Masters yeah you can all go [ __ ]

4426.48 --> 4432.599999999999
yourself with your dirty stinky

4429.48 --> 4437.04
spiritual corruption yeah your spiritual

4432.6 --> 4437.04
corruption is not good it's not heal

4437.44 --> 4443.5599999999995
healthy like it's just sick it's sick

4440.639 --> 4445.92
that you do that you're sick in the head

4443.56 --> 4449.120000000001
that you do that it's not

4445.92 --> 4453.12
therapy that you like play

4449.12 --> 4454.96
that it's just justifying sickness

4453.12 --> 4456.84
instead of actually doing something

4454.96 --> 4459.96
about it that's what it

4456.84 --> 4464.1990000000005
is just perpetuating the sickness in

4459.96 --> 4467.04
your mind I hate game Masters like that

4464.199 --> 4467.04
[ __ ] hate them

4468.719 --> 4473.28
and it's very rare to find an actual

4470.76 --> 4476.360000000001
game master that will take a paladin

4473.28 --> 4479.639
serious you're looking at

4476.36 --> 4482.4
one very very serious about it yeah

4479.639 --> 4483.679
another one is very serious about it

4482.4 --> 4488.92
yeah called

4483.679 --> 4491.28
toen yeah he was very very serious about

4488.92 --> 4494.0
good

4491.28 --> 4496.84
yeah I think he deserves some respect

4494.0 --> 4499.199
for that

4496.84 --> 4502.0
unlike a whole bunch of shitty ass game

4499.199 --> 4503.28
Masters out there who just love or they

4502.0 --> 4507.76
love the

4503.28 --> 4510.08
chaos everybody's chaotic random it's so

4507.76 --> 4511.52
fun no it isn't it's [ __ ] lame and

4510.08 --> 4515.4
everybody's

4511.52 --> 4519.0
[ __ ] yeah it's lame chaos

4515.4 --> 4522.04
sucks it sucks it's

4519.0 --> 4526.96
lame and people that like it

4522.04 --> 4526.96
suck they do provably

4527.56 --> 4533.88
yeah Gamers that are all about the chaos

4530.44 --> 4539.08
they suck they suck as people they suck

4533.88 --> 4542.12
as a person gaming with them sucks yeah

4539.08 --> 4546.6
people that are into Shady evil [ __ ]

4542.12 --> 4548.36
they suck they suck as people the G

4546.6 --> 4552.56
gaming with them

4548.36 --> 4556.32
sucks yeah you want to be a chaotic

4552.56 --> 4560.639
neutral counterbalance in a awful

4556.32 --> 4563.679
good other figure that's cool because

4560.639 --> 4568.28
now you want to actually be a character

4563.679 --> 4570.84
balance within a group dynamic that's

4568.28 --> 4573.719
fine but as soon as it's like everybody

4570.84 --> 4577.28
look oh we hate the Paladin then you

4573.719 --> 4581.6
know that group sucks and I will leave I

4577.28 --> 4585.159
hate people like that like those people

4581.6 --> 4587.84
just want to bathe in filth and

4585.159 --> 4589.96
corruption like in the real world and

4587.84 --> 4594.32
they suck and they're weak and they're

4589.96 --> 4594.32
pathetic I despise people like

4594.59 --> 4601.17
[Music]

4603.84 --> 4609.88
[Music]

4606.92 --> 4613.04
that never realized D inspired such

4609.88 --> 4616.639
passion from people yeah because it DN D

4613.04 --> 4621.44
is effectively a controlled form of

4616.639 --> 4624.12
shared Dark World you're sharing a a

4621.44 --> 4628.48
collectively together constructed

4624.12 --> 4628.48
imagination that is actually quite

4629.6 --> 4636.719
powerful it is quite

4632.56 --> 4640.080000000001
powerful and the dream can like persist

4636.719 --> 4643.199
even Beyond Death it's not a

4640.08 --> 4646.08
joke the collective dream you can create

4643.199 --> 4648.5599999999995
with players in a campaign that you play

4646.08 --> 4651.719
with for a very long time it's like a

4648.56 --> 4656.719
parallel Dimension that like can

4651.719 --> 4658.92
literally reach Beyond Death yeah people

4656.719 --> 4661.199
that have been lucky enough to

4658.92 --> 4663.8
experience like a long group like that

4661.199 --> 4666.5199999999995
that stayed together and wasn't just

4663.8 --> 4669.320000000001
disgusting they would even attest they

4666.52 --> 4672.88
would say like yeah this player died

4669.32 --> 4674.92
suddenly but then like during the gaming

4672.88 --> 4676.84
they would get like really weird things

4674.92 --> 4680.88
things

4676.84 --> 4683.08
happening like Communications like an

4680.88 --> 4687.1990000000005
idea that would pop in their head like

4683.08 --> 4690.92
whoa I I just got a message from the guy

4687.199 --> 4696.08
that died like he's saying to do this

4690.92 --> 4700.04
like that [ __ ] happens it really really

4696.08 --> 4702.92
happens yeah there's a bond that you can

4700.04 --> 4705.84
create if you're very serious D and

4702.92 --> 4711.679
players that reaches Beyond

4705.84 --> 4715.0
Death it's not a joke and it is

4711.679 --> 4717.12
amazing but be careful who you bind with

4715.0 --> 4719.52
because if there's something off you're

4717.12 --> 4721.8
going to have a nightmare you're going

4719.52 --> 4724.4400000000005
to have a nightmare just having to deal

4721.8 --> 4727.08
with those players every

4724.44 --> 4729.719
time you got to be properly attuned you

4727.08 --> 4733.08
got to have the right understanding

4729.719 --> 4736.719
about reality and demeanor you got to

4733.08 --> 4736.719
have respect

4737.04 --> 4744.4
for

4739.36 --> 4747.12
the for the uh the demeanor chart you

4744.4 --> 4751.92
got to understand that there really that

4747.12 --> 4754.44
it matters that good neutral evil really

4751.92 --> 4758.4
is significant that it has an influence

4754.44 --> 4761.159
on everybody and that lawful neutral

4758.4 --> 4763.92
chaotic really makes a difference that

4761.159 --> 4765.4
it really is something you have to all

4763.92 --> 4768.6
understand that

4765.4 --> 4771.08
if you don't the whole group dynamic is

4768.6 --> 4771.08
going to go

4774.199 --> 4780.799999999999
astray if somebody in the group doesn't

4777.08 --> 4783.32
take it serious that group will break up

4780.8 --> 4786.4400000000005
every time if you don't take those

4783.32 --> 4788.159
Dynamics serious the group will be

4786.44 --> 4791.5599999999995
breaking up

4788.159 --> 4791.5599999999995
guaranteed always

4791.679 --> 4796.639
happens every

4793.639 --> 4796.639
time

4808.6 --> 4813.1990000000005
okay debatable D that's cute back story

4811.48 --> 4815.678999999999
I'm not talking about Back stories

4813.199 --> 4818.919999999999
though Back stories can be pretty

4815.679 --> 4821.76
Dynamic can be all over the place

4818.92 --> 4823.639
paladins all often have a a tragic

4821.76 --> 4828.360000000001
backstory because

4823.639 --> 4830.639
otherwise paladins are usually like just

4828.36 --> 4834.199
important Soldier

4830.639 --> 4836.88
figures they don't tend to hang around

4834.199 --> 4840.678999999999
Adventures because they have a Lord that

4836.88 --> 4844.2390000000005
they have to obey so then usually some

4840.679 --> 4846.12
form of tragedy has to be involved in

4844.239 --> 4849.04
order in their backstory in order for

4846.12 --> 4851.32
them to justify being

4849.04 --> 4853.56
Adventures it's a little complicated

4851.32 --> 4853.5599999999995
like

4853.639 --> 4858.08
that

4855.36 --> 4858.08
right

4861.32 --> 4866.44
anyway life siiz dragon for your homeor

4864.76 --> 4870.56
wow

4866.44 --> 4874.4
okay what is a life-sized

4870.56 --> 4879.4400000000005
Dragon you mean as big as a human

4874.4 --> 4883.5599999999995
being or as big as a house which is

4879.44 --> 4886.5599999999995
actually how big dragons tend to

4883.56 --> 4886.56
be

4889.32 --> 4895.12
good pal there's no non good paladins

4891.92 --> 4896.84
paladins are per definition good it is

4895.12 --> 4899.599999999999
their defining

4896.84 --> 4902.1990000000005
trait if you're not good you don't get

4899.6 --> 4902.1990000000005
Paladin

4906.88 --> 4912.88
Powers Yeah there's no neutral paladins

4910.12 --> 4916.5599999999995
although I did kind of like redefine

4912.88 --> 4919.52
paladins slightly to make them more

4916.56 --> 4921.679
logical so now instead of a paladin

4919.52 --> 4925.92
always having to be lawful

4921.679 --> 4928.52
good they can be more

4925.92 --> 4931.639
lawful or more

4928.52 --> 4933.2390000000005
good so Paladin can technically be

4931.639 --> 4937.679
lawful

4933.239 --> 4941.718999999999
neutral never below neutral though

4937.679 --> 4943.08
or neutral good like that is an option

4941.719 --> 4947.28
but it's

4943.08 --> 4951.159
like a character Focus

4947.28 --> 4954.5199999999995
preference because lawful and good can

4951.159 --> 4957.28
literally conflict and it's like it's

4954.52 --> 4959.92
been this debacco philosophical debacco

4957.28 --> 4961.84
within DN D about it like oh the

4959.92 --> 4965.52
conflict of lawful and good and it's

4961.84 --> 4969.08
like [ __ ] you that's ridiculous you can

4965.52 --> 4972.120000000001
just lean can be paladins that are more

4969.08 --> 4973.96
about obsession with law or you can have

4972.12 --> 4976.32
paladins that are obsession with the

4973.96 --> 4978.04
spirit of good and then law becomes

4976.32 --> 4982.199
secondary and that's just how it is

4978.04 --> 4985.199
which becomes secondary good or law

4982.199 --> 4988.12
choose you might not have to choose but

4985.199 --> 4991.36
circumstances will force you to choose

4988.12 --> 4994.5599999999995
eventually and so that's how I

4991.36 --> 4994.5599999999995
redesigned the

4999.84 --> 5006.28
Paladin good Paladin character

5003.04 --> 5009.44
sheets okay

5006.28 --> 5012.44
sorry for the confusion

5009.44 --> 5012.44
yeah

5013.0 --> 5018.679
whatever alignment is critical any

5016.52 --> 5023.320000000001
players that don't take alignment

5018.679 --> 5023.32
serious are going to suck at the

5030.6 --> 5037.52
end right because it matters even with

5034.04 --> 5042.0
the power from the dieties the deities

5037.52 --> 5046.400000000001
the gods the little G gods that dispense

5042.0 --> 5051.04
powers to priests directly it's all very

5046.4 --> 5052.839999999999
close like how dare you but seriously

5051.04 --> 5054.96
like yeah Christians might think oh how

5052.84 --> 5057.1990000000005
dare you well they can go [ __ ]

5054.96 --> 5060.159
themselves I mean seriously go [ __ ]

5057.199 --> 5063.199
yourselves right but in Dungeons and

5060.159 --> 5065.759999999999
Dragons there is Gods Pantheon Gods all

5063.199 --> 5069.08
over the place they are war with each

5065.76 --> 5071.719
other and they have like alignment based

5069.08 --> 5076.12
powers and it's very distinct how that

5071.719 --> 5078.36
works and if you step outside of the

5076.12 --> 5080.0
alignment of your diety you're going to

5078.36 --> 5082.5199999999995
get in trouble with it you might be able

5080.0 --> 5085.76
to switch somehow but that's dangerous

5082.52 --> 5085.76
too it's all pretty

5086.679 --> 5092.56
complex are there any real dragons no

5090.32 --> 5092.5599999999995
not

5093.32 --> 5096.32
physically

5097.719 --> 5103.04
although you could say that

5100.84 --> 5107.28
big

5103.04 --> 5107.28
iguanas are dragons

5108.159 --> 5113.119
maybe there may have been really large

5111.679 --> 5115.719
reptiles

5113.119 --> 5118.199
that who knows might have even had like

5115.719 --> 5120.32
telepathic abilities so that people

5118.199 --> 5123.5199999999995
would think they could talk and they

5120.32 --> 5125.679
might have had like some sort of acid

5123.52 --> 5128.96
spit that that would

5125.679 --> 5131.32
ignite it wouldn't be like fire like

5128.96 --> 5133.0
literal flame going out of their mouths

5131.32 --> 5136.48
but they might be able to like spit

5133.0 --> 5139.44
something that kind of resembling the

5136.48 --> 5141.08
bombarder beetle might like they spit

5139.44 --> 5144.759999999999
something then it

5141.08 --> 5144.76
ignites that might have

5145.679 --> 5152.4800000000005
existed so yeah there might have been

5149.44 --> 5155.839999999999
all kinds of bizarre giant reptiles in

5152.48 --> 5158.678999999999
the ancient times that might have sort

5155.84 --> 5158.679
of resembled

5160.0 --> 5165.84
dragons right there might have been

5162.04 --> 5169.0
reptiles that could like the Flying

5165.84 --> 5171.76
Squirrel could like the typical Asian

5169.0 --> 5174.719
Dragon like the Chinese type dragons

5171.76 --> 5176.92
could hover down like jump off a

5174.719 --> 5179.04
mountain and then just Glide down and

5176.92 --> 5182.08
that that would be seen as flying like

5179.04 --> 5184.04
that could have existed too don't really

5182.08 --> 5187.88
think they would have ever had wings

5184.04 --> 5191.04
like Birds I think that that is a man's

5187.88 --> 5192.96
idea that then also resonated with like

5191.04 --> 5194.8
supposed dinosaurs and then they say

5192.96 --> 5197.0
like oh yeah dinosaurs are actually

5194.8 --> 5200.96
descending or the chickens are The

5197.0 --> 5203.4
Descendant from the dinosaurs like uh no

5200.96 --> 5203.4
no they're

5204.679 --> 5211.52
not but uh there might have been all

5207.199 --> 5215.5199999999995
kinds of reptiles in the very far past

5211.52 --> 5219.8
like yeah but spirit ual

5215.52 --> 5223.52
dragons they're arguably still

5219.8 --> 5223.52
there on the other

5226.44 --> 5230.5199999999995
side I'd have to

5228.76 --> 5234.320000000001
consult

5230.52 --> 5236.679
like some ascended masters in the East

5234.32 --> 5239.239
about it like hey are the spiritual

5236.679 --> 5242.6
dragons still there they might be there

5239.239 --> 5244.718999999999
forever timelessly I'm not sure I've

5242.6 --> 5248.119000000001
never actually personally

5244.719 --> 5251.88
witnessed even in the dark world like a

5248.119 --> 5254.839999999999
Chinese style Dragon but I know I've

5251.88 --> 5258.28
always known they were there and I love

5254.84 --> 5261.0
them I have a great reverence for

5258.28 --> 5264.0
reptiles in the spiritual realm always

5261.0 --> 5266.8
have and like all this look oh they're

5264.0 --> 5270.239
secretly reptiles I'm like you're

5266.8 --> 5273.159000000001
[ __ ] [ __ ] yeah I'm going to tell

5270.239 --> 5276.119
you they're better than you you're just

5273.159 --> 5276.119
pitiful

5276.8 --> 5282.360000000001
yeah

5278.0 --> 5284.96
spirit Spirit reptiles are the good

5282.36 --> 5287.5199999999995
guys

5284.96 --> 5292.639
yeah now maybe that's because I'm

5287.52 --> 5296.4400000000005
slightly Asian I'm little bit Asian so I

5292.639 --> 5300.639
think spiritual reptiles good yeah might

5296.44 --> 5306.119
be maybe that's because that's what's in

5300.639 --> 5306.119
me I don't know I see them as good

5306.6 --> 5311.1990000000005
yeah when it comes to the spiritual

5309.36 --> 5314.48
realm

5311.199 --> 5318.96
insectoids and arachnites are the dark

5314.48 --> 5322.48
ones are aromantic and the reptiles are

5318.96 --> 5325.4
arguably the light ones maybe a little

5322.48 --> 5329.119
luciferian right they could

5325.4 --> 5333.04
be but they're definitely the lesser of

5329.119 --> 5336.04
two evils if if I'd have to designate

5333.04 --> 5336.04
them

5341.08 --> 5346.08
right but if you have like some kind of

5343.8 --> 5349.4400000000005
hallucinogen

5346.08 --> 5350.5599999999995
right and you're seeing salamanders

5349.44 --> 5353.28
walking

5350.56 --> 5355.4400000000005
around in the spirit realm that's a good

5353.28 --> 5360.0
sign that's a

5355.44 --> 5363.04
blessing yeah and Shaman will tell you

5360.0 --> 5364.84
that because it's

5363.04 --> 5367.44
true

5364.84 --> 5369.84
yeah snakes

5367.44 --> 5371.678999999999
salamanders they're a blessing but

5369.84 --> 5374.119000000001
salamanders especially like that's one

5371.679 --> 5376.6
of the best things you could pop into

5374.119 --> 5381.04
snakes might be a bit

5376.6 --> 5384.52
weirder reptiles are good on the other

5381.04 --> 5388.159
side it's it gets problematic when

5384.52 --> 5391.119000000001
you're going to see insects yeah bats

5388.159 --> 5392.719
the darkness and that's why like I keep

5391.119 --> 5395.119
this distinctly

5392.719 --> 5397.6
different you have have the

5395.119 --> 5400.159
reptiloids and you have the

5397.6 --> 5402.8
insectoids they're in direct opposition

5400.159 --> 5406.719
of one another in the spiritual

5402.8 --> 5410.360000000001
realm it is as as straightforward good

5406.719 --> 5410.36
and evil as you could get pretty

5412.8 --> 5417.84
much

5414.92 --> 5420.6
yeah yeah that's the last shitty remark

5417.84 --> 5420.6
you make in my

5422.44 --> 5425.96
chat what about

5430.0 --> 5435.6
antis I don't think you see a mantis in

5433.92 --> 5438.36
the spiritual realm but that's an

5435.6 --> 5438.360000000001
interesting one

5441.36 --> 5444.679
too I don't

5445.639 --> 5451.1990000000005
know but I mean amantis is a real

5448.679 --> 5451.1990000000005
physical

5451.92 --> 5456.96
creature bit more yeah they are

5454.159 --> 5460.599999999999
different I I'm not look I'm not saying

5456.96 --> 5462.4800000000005
insect evil I'm not in the real physical

5460.6 --> 5463.639
world I'm not saying that I'm talking

5462.48 --> 5469.199
about

5463.639 --> 5471.6
specific spiritual perceived things not

5469.199 --> 5475.678999999999
the physical creature

5471.6 --> 5479.119000000001
yeah I mean dung beetles are cute as

5475.679 --> 5483.28
hell I like them they're not

5479.119 --> 5486.28
evil right I'm talking about spiritual

5483.28 --> 5489.28
specific experiences in the spiritual

5486.28 --> 5494.199
realm on the other side in the dark

5489.28 --> 5498.5199999999995
world insectoids are a bad

5494.199 --> 5501.5199999999995
sign reptiloids are a good sign if you

5498.52 --> 5504.280000000001
want to get a feel for what I'm talking

5501.52 --> 5506.96

European movie it's a

multilanguage movie it's like about

America but it's very European about

5592.199 --> 5597.919999999999
America it's not

5594.08 --> 5597.92
Americans that are making that

that

5759.04 --> 5762.08
nobody cares brick

5765.239 --> 5771.199
topper yes wearing a t-shirt it's been

5768.36 --> 5773.799999999999
very warm today it might get colder

5771.199 --> 5775.879999999999
again after this though the weather does

5773.8 --> 5779.1990000000005
seem to predict that it's going to get

5775.88 --> 5781.4400000000005
colder again but yeah today's been like

5779.199 --> 5785.5599999999995
very

5781.44 --> 5785.5599999999995
warm like too warm to wear

5785.58 --> 5793.839
[Music]

5811.01 --> 5815.52
[Music]

5812.52 --> 5815.52
sweater

5817.06 --> 5824.09
[Music]

5832.199 --> 5835.04
yeah I'm

5833.42 --> 5837.76
[Music]

5835.04 --> 5840.04
expanding expanding the title now it's

5837.76 --> 5843.56
dinosaurs are fake they Dragon mths the

5840.04 --> 5846.159
Indie cosmology and spiritual reptiles

5843.56 --> 5850.159000000001
it's been very reptilian

5846.159 --> 5850.159
today very reptilian

5868.11 --> 5871.41
[Music]

5872.44 --> 5875.44
indeed

5882.36 --> 5885.92
how do I think the universe

5888.159 --> 5891.92
started I try not

5901.48 --> 5906.598999999999
to logically it would have started at

5905.52 --> 5912.4400000000005
some

5906.599 --> 5912.4400000000005
point but nobody can figure out

5914.92 --> 5921.76
how did God start the

5919.48 --> 5925.239
universe or did God

5921.76 --> 5927.4800000000005
merely start the material Universe right

5925.239 --> 5930.598999999999
but here's the

5927.48 --> 5934.799999999999
thing if the spirit existed before the

5930.599 --> 5936.92
material realm existed then what started

5934.8 --> 5939.84
the spiritual

5936.92 --> 5943.679
realm that's literally an unanswerable

5939.84 --> 5948.159000000001
question like yeah at some point logic

5943.679 --> 5949.4800000000005
no longer provides it just doesn't it's

5948.159 --> 5953.719
kind of

5949.48 --> 5954.718999999999
confusing but thanks to laws of nature

5953.719 --> 5958.76
we can

5954.719 --> 5962.36
definitely know that the Physical Realm

5958.76 --> 5965.719
would have to have

5962.36 --> 5965.719
started because of

5969.48 --> 5975.799999999999
entropy ontological

5971.88 --> 5975.8
primitive and that's just how it

5980.8 --> 5983.8
is

5985.08 --> 5990.08
right and so one could

5990.52 --> 5994.76
argue the

5992.32 --> 5997.36
designer

5994.76 --> 6000.599
thought what if we condense the

5997.36 --> 6005.719
spiritual realm partially

6000.599 --> 6005.719
into something more solid

6006.08 --> 6009.84
something that's not as

6011.119 --> 6014.92
fluid and we call it

6015.159 --> 6018.92
physical and

6017.159 --> 6021.5199999999995
then

6018.92 --> 6025.32
condensed the spiritual realm into a

6021.52 --> 6025.320000000001
Physical Realm

6025.4 --> 6032.08
then in the face of

6027.96 --> 6033.119
that manifested separated Spirits which

6032.08 --> 6035.48
would be the

6033.119 --> 6039.08
Shapers the

6035.48 --> 6043.36
Elohim that would go into as Spirits

6039.08 --> 6047.04
into the Physical Realm and shape

6043.36 --> 6049.32
it and shape it in accordance to the the

6047.04 --> 6053.32
ideas the

6049.32 --> 6056.04
designs of the original God who is

6053.32 --> 6059.5599999999995
forever outside of the Physical Realm

6056.04 --> 6062.44
cuz he existed and he always will

6059.56 --> 6063.8
exist but that only works outside of the

6062.44 --> 6066.08
Physical

6063.8 --> 6069.1990000000005
Realm because in the Physical Realm

6066.08 --> 6072.84
there has to be a beginning and an

6069.199 --> 6075.638999999999
end because of the nature of matter and

6072.84 --> 6079.56
entropy so the

6075.639 --> 6081.400000000001
designer thought of the material realm

6079.56 --> 6085.599
and what it could

6081.4 --> 6089.119
do then the Shapers

6085.599 --> 6091.2390000000005
shaped the Physical Realm into what it

6089.119 --> 6095.719
could

6091.239 --> 6095.718999999999
be then the Shapers ended

6097.28 --> 6104.8
up stuck

6100.52 --> 6109.719
basically they were now part

6104.8 --> 6109.719
of yeah the finite nature of the

6111.32 --> 6116.36
realm they couldn't

6114.0 --> 6119.08
become Eternal again with God so they

6116.36 --> 6123.159
would have separated from God just from

6119.08 --> 6124.639
the original Creator Spirit just shaping

6123.159 --> 6127.92
shaping the

6124.639 --> 6131.28
matter and they're probably part of the

6127.92 --> 6133.84
spirits that determine our destiny and

6131.28 --> 6135.679
maybe haunt us and or maybe also part of

6133.84 --> 6138.52
like this reset

6135.679 --> 6141.8
cycle the gods sitting on the throne

6138.52 --> 6144.040000000001
waiting for things to become so bad that

6141.8 --> 6146.320000000001
they come out

6144.04 --> 6148.0
come out of the fourth dimension destroy

6146.32 --> 6152.759999999999
everything and

6148.0 --> 6152.76
then shape the realm once

6172.119 --> 6175.119
again

6175.199 --> 6179.08
so yeah that's that's how I see

6202.119 --> 6205.119
it

6211.159 --> 6220.839999999999
and in that sense I also think

6213.719 --> 6220.84
that it just funn funny enough an idea

6225.0 --> 6231.52
from Jordan Maxwell which is kind like

6228.32 --> 6234.08
he has many ideas and not of them are

6231.52 --> 6235.4800000000005
good he says like yeah the whole Adam

6234.08 --> 6238.36
and

6235.48 --> 6242.799999999999
Eve that's just the last

6238.36 --> 6242.799999999999
reset that's just the

6243.119 --> 6248.679
Shapers

6244.8 --> 6251.96
recreating a new to send out and

6248.679 --> 6253.32
repopulate the Earth which means that it

6251.96 --> 6255.4800000000005
was

6253.32 --> 6257.759999999999
populated it's getting

6255.48 --> 6260.48
repopulated and I think that that does

6257.76 --> 6262.52
happen I think he had a great point with

6260.48 --> 6265.08
that even though it might not be

6262.52 --> 6267.0
biblically back or whatever

6265.08 --> 6270.8
man it is

6267.0 --> 6271.8
logical that the corruption described

6270.8 --> 6274.92
about the

6271.8 --> 6278.320000000001
flood is would not have been the only

6274.92 --> 6281.84
one I mean the flood already

6278.32 --> 6285.88
happened supposedly after Adam and

6281.84 --> 6287.1990000000005
Eve in the in the chronology of the

6285.88 --> 6290.52
Bible

6287.199 --> 6290.5199999999995
so that

6291.28 --> 6296.88
means that it happens more than

6294.28 --> 6300.44
once according to that

6296.88 --> 6303.119
logic which means that it keeps

6300.44 --> 6304.96
happening we're in an ever increasing

6303.119 --> 6308.199
entropy

6304.96 --> 6312.599
cycle where people

6308.199 --> 6316.0
develop technology wisdom insights and

6312.599 --> 6319.2390000000005
the corruption to counterbalance it

6316.0 --> 6321.0
until evil has overtaken everything it

6319.239 --> 6324.199
turns into Sodom and gomorra

6321.0 --> 6327.0
symbolically and literally are

6324.199 --> 6329.199
to the point where evil literally just

6327.0 --> 6332.48
can't even shine in between that

6329.199 --> 6334.119
anymore and then it it is destroyed then

6332.48 --> 6337.36
the gods come out of the fourth

6334.119 --> 6339.44
dimension and like okay now you're done

6337.36 --> 6344.0
you're at the end of this cycle there's

6339.44 --> 6345.44
nowhere good you can go now you all die

6344.0 --> 6349.84
and everything gets

6345.44 --> 6349.839999999999
erased gets completely reset

6350.52 --> 6354.92
reshaped and people

6355.32 --> 6362.639
the design of man itself might be

6357.56 --> 6365.360000000001
altered by the Shapers again and set out

6362.639 --> 6367.84
like a new Adam and Eve to repopulate

6365.36 --> 6370.199
the Earth over and over again that it

6367.84 --> 6370.1990000000005
keeps

6381.04 --> 6384.92
happening huh

6391.32 --> 6395.88
what's your thoughts on Max on that

6393.04 --> 6395.88
Maxell

6397.44 --> 6403.44
what well Jord Maxell

6400.04 --> 6409.239
is a very very

6403.44 --> 6411.759999999999
typical '90s conspiracy guy very '90s

6409.239 --> 6413.799999999999
but even like listening to his old

6411.76 --> 6415.84
presentations is very inspiring to

6413.8 --> 6418.320000000001
listen to that now and it can just

6415.84 --> 6421.639
immediately Point like oh yeah you're

6418.32 --> 6424.119
getting nutty like this is wrong and

6421.639 --> 6426.76
then other parts is like

6424.119 --> 6429.5599999999995
H he did kind of always have a point

6426.76 --> 6432.56
with that it is interesting no not

6429.56 --> 6432.56
Maxwell's

6441.84 --> 6444.84
equations

6447.44 --> 6453.199
I'm not talking about some physicist of

6449.96 --> 6457.36
the earliest 20th century debatable D

6453.199 --> 6459.0
I'm talking about a conspiracy guy from

6457.36 --> 6462.0
the

6459.0 --> 6462.0
9s

6465.33 --> 6468.43
[Music]

6471.84 --> 6474.84
dumbass

6482.04 --> 6486.32
right and Jordan Maxwell was really big

6484.96 --> 6489.4
he was

6486.32 --> 6493.239
like very prominent in the 90s and he

6489.4 --> 6497.598999999999
was basically carrying a lot of these

6493.239 --> 6497.598999999999
alternative narratives lots of

6500.56 --> 6508.92
them problem also was is that he was

6504.52 --> 6512.76
kind of a a ga guy he was like uh the

6508.92 --> 6515.0
but the Earth why isn't God the mother

6512.76 --> 6516.280000000001
earth like which is like kind of

6515.0 --> 6519.599
spiritually

6516.28 --> 6523.679
[ __ ] it is like he had issues with

6519.599 --> 6527.1990000000005
spirituality where he just didn't get it

6523.679 --> 6529.2390000000005
at all very palpable to me every time I

6527.199 --> 6531.799999999999
hear his speeches now it's just very

6529.239 --> 6537.119
apparent to me like there were things

6531.8 --> 6540.119000000001
spiritually they just didn't get at all

6537.119 --> 6542.759999999999
they continually bump into it

6540.119 --> 6545.88
incorrectly same way over and over and

6542.76 --> 6545.88
over again he just didn't get

6553.159 --> 6560.119
it he died a year ago what only a year

6557.719 --> 6563.32
ago Jordan Maxwell did great yeah he

6560.119 --> 6568.08
absolutely did great he is an old Titan

6563.32 --> 6571.4
like I mean he's almost singlehandedly

6568.08 --> 6574.08
shaped the 9s conspiracy

6571.4 --> 6577.839999999999
development like he was a great

6574.08 --> 6580.639
counterbalance to the whole CIA horeshit

6577.84 --> 6583.119000000001
roll out yeah he was the counterbalance

6580.639 --> 6586.1990000000005
to all the alien propaganda that

6583.119 --> 6588.119
happened around the 9s him that was like

6586.199 --> 6591.638999999999
mostly him Jordan

6588.119 --> 6594.639
Maxwell he was a great counterbalance

6591.639 --> 6594.639
he

6596.32 --> 6599.84
yeah that's what it

6604.88 --> 6609.599
is the [ __ ] are you talking about

6607.119 --> 6609.598999999999
borders

6609.679 --> 6612.679
boy

6618.32 --> 6624.679
no are you a [ __ ] tet sock why why

6621.4 --> 6628.92
did you not bring that up ever

6624.679 --> 6628.92
yeah leave me worrying about

6635.98 --> 6639.11
[Music]

6643.96 --> 6650.079
[Music]

6646.04 --> 6653.239
it yeah do that again and the next time

6650.079 --> 6656.119
you get a timeout yeah I'm having a good

6653.239 --> 6660.04
conversation here yeah that's not your

6656.119 --> 6662.36
[ __ ] cue to bring up trolls [ __ ]

6660.04 --> 6665.04
you got it do that [ __ ] again and

6662.36 --> 6665.04
I'll kick you

6681.56 --> 6684.56
out

6684.8 --> 6688.320000000001
yeah don't you worry about that a man

6691.0 --> 6694.92
goes

6692.599 --> 6697.679
like I don't know why the hell he would

6694.92 --> 6701.56
even say anything like that about you

6697.679 --> 6703.52
since the way you're capable of writing

6701.56 --> 6705.280000000001
isn't even within the range of

6703.52 --> 6707.4400000000005
possibilities for the guy that he thinks

6705.28 --> 6707.44
you

6708.4 --> 6711.4
are

6711.52 --> 6715.599
so

6713.28 --> 6718.119
I guess bord boy just a bit [ __ ]

6715.599 --> 6718.119000000001
every now and

6741.52 --> 6744.52
then

6760.8 --> 6765.400000000001
Bill Cooper guy oh God I barely even

6763.159 --> 6768.119
know Bill

6765.4 --> 6770.5199999999995
Cooper no a man go you're not disrupting

6768.119 --> 6771.44
the flow of the show at all you're doing

6770.52 --> 6773.76
just

6771.44 --> 6775.83
fine

6773.76 --> 6778.96
don't you worry about

6775.83 --> 6778.96
[Music]

6787.0 --> 6792.289
it who the hell was Bill

6789.17 --> 6792.289
[Music]

6794.44 --> 6798.32
Cooper oh God that

6799.0 --> 6804.44
guy

6801.44 --> 6804.44
no

6807.88 --> 6813.84
now Bill Cooper

6809.48 --> 6813.839999999999
is is like way more

6823.639 --> 6830.84
CIA like Bill Cooper like talked more

6827.76 --> 6833.280000000001
about aliens and like secret Moon Bas

6830.84 --> 6837.4800000000005
[ __ ] if I remember correctly Jordan

6833.28 --> 6839.4
Maxwell barely like addressed even that

6837.48 --> 6842.199
which in retrospect

6839.4 --> 6844.079
makes he was into aliens and ETS yeah

6842.199 --> 6847.04
but he would also recognize that they

6844.079 --> 6850.199
weren't like physical that they were

6847.04 --> 6855.119
spirits and demons yeah Jordan Maxwell

6850.199 --> 6855.119
said that and he was

6856.88 --> 6859.88
right

6861.36 --> 6864.36
okay

6864.4 --> 6869.96
Bill Cooper didn't Bill Cooper was like

6867.32 --> 6874.84
oh secret Moon Bas and [ __ ] which is

6869.96 --> 6878.32
like oh so a CIA plan then because a lot

6874.84 --> 6878.32
of that [ __ ] talk is

6879.28 --> 6884.239
Cia gten down by the federals yeah I'm

6881.8 --> 6884.2390000000005
sure he

6891.32 --> 6897.5599999999995
was had some good stuff like

6894.76 --> 6901.76
what what was his good stuff Richard you

6897.56 --> 6901.76
tell me I barely know anything about

6903.32 --> 6909.4
it I know I like most of Jordan Maxwell

6906.88 --> 6911.56
stuff also like his presentations are

6909.4 --> 6914.4
just interesting to listen to very

6911.56 --> 6914.400000000001
esoterically

6915.8 --> 6921.320000000001
inspiring he was just wrong about some

6919.079 --> 6924.32
things and that's

6921.32 --> 6924.32
all

6944.719 --> 6950.56
on sun

6946.719 --> 6950.56
Cults now that's Jordan

6951.239 --> 6959.159
Maxwell

6953.679 --> 6963.079
beheld a pill horse oh yeah I remember

6959.159 --> 6963.079
that the apocalypse

6964.84 --> 6970.679
stuff Zarah sit I don't know that

6980.32 --> 6988.719
name I I didn't know that Jordan Maxwell

6984.56 --> 6988.719
lived up to like last year that's pretty

6988.84 --> 6993.28
incredible I thought he died already

6991.119 --> 6996.28
like a decade ago or

6993.28 --> 6996.28
something

6998.239 --> 7003.678999999999
odd they had

7000.44 --> 7006.719
beef sure they

7003.679 --> 7008.88
did I mean a lot of conspiracy guys that

7006.719 --> 7012.56
were active in the 90s had beef with one

7008.88 --> 7017.1990000000005
another because it's like competition

7012.56 --> 7017.1990000000005
right the way it worked then was

7017.84 --> 7024.84
like you're the priest they were

7021.76 --> 7027.56
priesthoods of like their conspiracy

7024.84 --> 7029.119000000001
that's how they did it and they were

7027.56 --> 7031.56
pretty prominent and they would have

7029.119 --> 7034.679
like Book Sales and

7031.56 --> 7036.8
lectures but their subjects would

7034.679 --> 7039.28
overlap and they would have this very

7036.8 --> 7041.159000000001
strong competitiveness towards each

7039.28 --> 7044.159
other in the

7041.159 --> 7044.159
90s

7045.079 --> 7051.5599999999995
now with the internet so

7047.239 --> 7054.598999999999
strong and widespread and it's

7051.56 --> 7056.320000000001
just it's all over the place everything

7054.599 --> 7057.92
so it doesn't really work like that

7056.32 --> 7060.36
anymore

7057.92 --> 7063.719
now everybody's having their own

7060.36 --> 7063.719
conspiracy ideas and all

7071.119 --> 7075.44
that no idea what you're talking

7076.4 --> 7079.879999999999
about James

7081.28 --> 7084.92
pet Cooper love black

7083.71 --> 7086.56
[Music]

7084.92 --> 7088.84
SUVs

7086.56 --> 7090.96
yeah but that's the whole thing Cooper

7088.84 --> 7093.4400000000005
had a lot of

7090.96 --> 7096.119
like alien

7093.44 --> 7100.879999999999
and secret

7096.119 --> 7100.88
government conspiracy paranoia

7101.119 --> 7104.119
stuff

7112.36 --> 7116.0
that's right and that makes me think

7114.679 --> 7122.119
Richard G

7116.0 --> 7126.4
that Cooper was Bill Cooper was like CIA

7122.119 --> 7131.598999999999
or CIA related he had CIA people talk

7126.4 --> 7134.119
that stuff so he's like X Files adjacent

7131.599 --> 7136.32
right if you're X Files adjacent like

7134.119 --> 7139.44
everything that's treated in X Files if

7136.32 --> 7144.079
you're kind of talking around that stuff

7139.44 --> 7146.32
that means to me to me yeah think of it

7144.079 --> 7149.199
whatever you will if to me that means oh

7146.32 --> 7152.04
so you got a CIA line in not that they

7149.199 --> 7155.32
would have to be even aware of that it's

7152.04 --> 7157.76
just that's what the CIA does

7155.32 --> 7161.679
information placement into a specific

7157.76 --> 7163.84
Direction especially concerning aliens

7161.679 --> 7166.84
and I ideas of Men In

7163.84 --> 7168.84
Black that kind of thing yeah X Files A

7166.84 --> 7171.400000000001
J it's very serious

7168.84 --> 7173.88
though right and that was Bill Cooper he

7171.4 --> 7178.119
was always talking about that sort of

7173.88 --> 7179.52
stuff and it's it's nonsense it's

7178.119 --> 7183.239
paranoia

7179.52 --> 7185.679
placement it's what it is it's proved to

7183.239 --> 7185.678999999999
be

7187.159 --> 7193.0
nonsense yeah

7189.199 --> 7195.44
misinformation Mis Mision Mis leading

7193.0 --> 7200.079
information that's what that

7195.44 --> 7202.199
is well Jordan Maxwell didn't seem to be

7200.079 --> 7204.4
caring all that much about it he would

7202.199 --> 7207.159
like address some of it if people asked

7204.4 --> 7208.879999999999
him but he Jordan Maxwell all the

7207.159 --> 7211.92
speeches I've seen of him he's just

7208.88 --> 7214.4800000000005
always talking about esoterics and about

7211.92 --> 7218.1990000000005
the meaning of occult ancient symbols

7214.48 --> 7221.04
and how that works and just stuff that

7218.199 --> 7223.598999999999
is way more interesting it's just way

7221.04 --> 7226.88
more interesting and durable like you

7223.599 --> 7228.679
actually it stands the test of time like

7226.88 --> 7230.76
in 20 years you could still watch a

7228.679 --> 7232.2390000000005
Jordan Maxwell presentation and would

7230.76 --> 7236.360000000001
still hold

7232.239 --> 7236.36
value yeah that's the

7250.92 --> 7253.92
difference

7259.639 --> 7262.32
SK was

7263.56 --> 7269.4400000000005
hot this cute for

7267.079 --> 7272.32
Redhead like even at an older age she's

7269.44 --> 7272.32
still kind of

7273.44 --> 7280.4
cute it's kind of like the same like a

7276.92 --> 7280.4
petricia stere type of

7280.92 --> 7283.92
hotness

7294.239 --> 7298.5599999999995
yeah and Moulder is just a complete

7296.0 --> 7298.56
[ __ ]

7310.84 --> 7313.84
now

7340.84 --> 7343.84
anyway

7347.88 --> 7352.719
what the [ __ ] does IC even

7368.119 --> 7373.839999999999
mean she's super liberal well that's

7371.52 --> 7373.84
that's

7375.98 --> 7383.04
[Music]

7378.92 --> 7386.159
sad but I mean they're actors and actors

7383.04 --> 7389.28
always like seem way cooler than they

7386.159 --> 7391.5599999999995
really are as a person most actors are

7389.28 --> 7394.199
like abominably

7391.56 --> 7398.1990000000005
[ __ ] like they're so [ __ ] stupid

7394.199 --> 7402.96
it is embarrassing in real in real life

7398.199 --> 7405.079
they're really really dumb

7402.96 --> 7409.0
and slavish

7405.079 --> 7411.28
often very cucky so it's not surprising

7409.0 --> 7414.239
that they're like oh I'm really liberal

7411.28 --> 7418.119
because that's like oh that way I'm not

7414.239 --> 7418.119
offensive and they'll hire

7418.28 --> 7424.96
me like that [ __ ] that's how actors are

7422.119 --> 7427.199
actors in like real Hollywood actors the

7424.96 --> 7429.079
roles they're they play are badass and

7427.199 --> 7432.879999999999
very appealing

7429.079 --> 7437.679
yeah who they are as a person in real

7432.88 --> 7438.4400000000005
life is like a a brutal contrast to how

7437.679 --> 7440.32
they

7438.44 --> 7443.079
act

7440.32 --> 7446.119
yeah in the real world they're not

7443.079 --> 7451.199
badass they're often a bunch of

7446.119 --> 7455.36
[ __ ] like really pliable

7451.199 --> 7459.199
losers and just [ __ ] overall [ __ ] and

7455.36 --> 7463.32
like like they will be part of pathetic

7459.199 --> 7465.96
Trends just to seem like oh more popular

7463.32 --> 7469.599
it's really pathetic there a lot of

7465.96 --> 7469.599
actors are just really [ __ ]

7470.119 --> 7473.679
pathetic it's what it

7474.639 --> 7483.28
is try not to worry so much about

7478.28 --> 7486.36
it accept keano Reeves uh no no keano

7483.28 --> 7490.48
Reeves is is like a

7486.36 --> 7490.48
lesbian he's not amazing at

7490.639 --> 7493.639
all

7501.159 --> 7507.558999999999
no no Kiana Reeves is actually quite the

7505.0 --> 7510.719
example of exactly how [ __ ] pathetic

7507.559 --> 7510.719
Hollywood people really

7516.639 --> 7522.639
are always hated Keanu well he's an

7520.52 --> 7525.8
overall terrible

7522.639 --> 7526.719
actor the only thing he was good in was

7525.8 --> 7528.320000000001
The

7526.719 --> 7532.8
Matrix

7528.32 --> 7534.599
because he was just Bland and like the

7532.8 --> 7539.04
character the main character needed to

7534.599 --> 7543.28
be Bland to be subjected to the story so

7539.04 --> 7545.0
he was his blandness was good for that

7543.28 --> 7548.88
character in that

7545.0 --> 7552.28
movie but like have you ever watched his

7548.88 --> 7555.559
other movies in which he is the guy is a

7552.28 --> 7557.88
terrible actor

7555.559 --> 7560.92
terrible he

7557.88 --> 7563.079
sucks like really

7560.92 --> 7567.639
sucks I'm sorry

7563.079 --> 7571.119
dude I want to like you but you

7567.639 --> 7573.84
suck you should have stuck to the Matrix

7571.119 --> 7575.96
really just stick to Bland roles where

7573.84 --> 7578.84
you don't have to have

7575.96 --> 7581.76
character just have to be a pretty

7578.84 --> 7583.679
boy like that works for him but the soon

7581.76 --> 7587.2390000000005
as he actually has to display any kind

7583.679 --> 7587.2390000000005
of character it's just

7601.719 --> 7606.639
atrocious I mean have you ever seen him

7604.4 --> 7610.5199999999995
like what is it called he's like an

7606.639 --> 7613.52
interview with the Vampire right let me

7610.52 --> 7613.52
check

7616.159 --> 7624.199
see SC in there is he in there no he

7621.159 --> 7627.879999999999
isn't maybe what is that movie in which

7624.199 --> 7627.879999999999
he just had a side roll as a

7629.719 --> 7637.0
kid it's another movie perhaps but it's

7632.88 --> 7637.0
just he's like kind of young in

7637.079 --> 7640.079
it

7640.52 --> 7646.280000000001
and

7643.159 --> 7649.558999999999
he's like that's like how he acts in it

7646.28 --> 7652.4
is so unnatural like his performance in

7649.559 --> 7655.679
that one movie when he's a kid like

7652.4 --> 7659.159
almost like destroys the entire movie it

7655.679 --> 7663.28
breaks you out of it so badly it's like

7659.159 --> 7665.879999999999
one of the worst onscreen acting ever of

7663.28 --> 7668.4
all time that's Kiana

7665.88 --> 7670.4400000000005
Rees I don't remember which movie that

7668.4 --> 7673.44
was

7670.44 --> 7673.44
though

7677.28 --> 7683.119
a Dracula yeah could be no bill and now

7680.079 --> 7687.84
Bill Ted was fine the original Bill and

7683.119 --> 7690.719
Ted's fine he's okay in that the newer

7687.84 --> 7692.84
remake or the ne not remake the third

7690.719 --> 7696.92
one is

7692.84 --> 7698.2390000000005
horrendous like horrendous man oh my god

7696.92 --> 7702.52
did he [ __ ] it

7698.239 --> 7706.079
up like it was just I could just feel

7702.52 --> 7709.320000000001
like everybody hated him like he screwed

7706.079 --> 7714.0
it up he screwed up his own iconic

7709.32 --> 7717.36
character he was so [ __ ] lame like

7714.0 --> 7719.28
how can you [ __ ] up your own most iconic

7717.36 --> 7722.239
character so

7719.28 --> 7724.88
badly what an

7722.239 --> 7727.4
idiot like the other guy was like

7724.88 --> 7729.52
totally into it everybody in that movie

7727.4 --> 7731.32
the new bill andet were totally into it

7729.52 --> 7732.52
they were like yeah let's do it and he

7731.32 --> 7736.32
was is

7732.52 --> 7738.84
like like dude what the [ __ ] is wrong

7736.32 --> 7741.04
with you you [ __ ] up your own movie

7738.84 --> 7744.88
you [ __ ]

7741.04 --> 7748.36
[ __ ] like that's your iconic movie he

7744.88 --> 7749.4800000000005
[ __ ] it up he totally [ __ ] up his

7748.36 --> 7753.119
own

7749.48 --> 7753.119
movie what an

7760.36 --> 7763.36
idiot

7771.239 --> 7776.04
do you think you could beat Death in a

7774.04 --> 7779.76
game of DnD

7776.04 --> 7783.28
D I thank your

7779.76 --> 7785.679
battleship no you can't beat anybody in

7783.28 --> 7789.639
a game of D and

7785.679 --> 7789.639
D doesn't work like

7790.32 --> 7793.32
that

7803.639 --> 7809.52
but yeah I mean Bogus Journey was

7806.0 --> 7812.8
hilarious I loveed it it was

7809.52 --> 7815.360000000001
great but that third one it's like it

7812.8 --> 7819.8
could have been great but keano just

7815.36 --> 7822.199
[ __ ] it up like totally [ __ ] like I

7819.8 --> 7825.2390000000005
can't believe

7822.199 --> 7827.48
that they that the director just allowed

7825.239 --> 7831.638999999999
him to act like that and then put it in

7827.48 --> 7831.638999999999
the film I can't believe he did

7832.559 --> 7838.559
that like I would have threatened keano

7835.559 --> 7842.320000000001
to sue him like if you don't [ __ ] act

7838.559 --> 7846.1990000000005
like your character I'm going to sue you

7842.32 --> 7848.558999999999
Keanu you hear you play your character

7846.199 --> 7852.199
properly and you put some [ __ ]

7848.559 --> 7854.679
feeling into it or I'm going to sue you

7852.199 --> 7854.678999999999
you got

7856.96 --> 7860.92
it I can't believe they let him get away

7859.52 --> 7864.88
with that

7860.92 --> 7864.88
crap they should sue

7873.96 --> 7879.159
him hey C it's been a

7880.239 --> 7883.239
while

7910.239 --> 7913.239
for

7919.199 --> 7924.159
today's stream T no no today's stream

7921.559 --> 7928.96
title is full this is just

7924.159 --> 7930.759999999999
the last stuff that's getting discussed

7928.96 --> 7933.8
I mean it just keeps moving and moving

7930.76 --> 7935.84
and moving and got really interesting at

7933.8 --> 7937.52
first about the reptiles I don't know

7935.84 --> 7939.0
why the hell we're now discussing K

7937.52 --> 7941.559
Reeves all of a

7939.0 --> 7943.76
sudden I have no idea how that it came

7941.559 --> 7943.76
to

7946.96 --> 7953.8
be but I mean every time he comes up it

7949.76 --> 7953.8
just pisses me off it's like

7954.119 --> 7959.88
dude I mean that actor like

7957.0 --> 7962.88
singlehandedly ruined so many good

7959.88 --> 7965.92
movies I can't believe they just let him

7962.88 --> 7965.92
keep getting away with

7970.119 --> 7973.119
it

7984.559 --> 7988.360000000001
I mean you'd almost think that he might

7986.92 --> 7992.4800000000005
have some like

7988.36 --> 7995.759999999999
weird Rothchild Satan daddy that just

7992.48 --> 8000.718999999999
like okay it's like okay I will give you

7995.76 --> 8003.4800000000005
like a 100 million for your movie budget

8000.719 --> 8006.4800000000005
if you you find a main role for keano

8003.48 --> 8007.959999999999
Reeves I mean it almost has to be like

8006.48 --> 8011.959999999999
that doesn't

8007.96 --> 8015.0
it like who the [ __ ] would pay that

8011.96 --> 8017.88
[ __ ] money to play a role in your

8015.0 --> 8019.28
movie who in their right [ __ ] mind

8017.88 --> 8023.079
would do such a

8019.28 --> 8026.719
thing it's ridiculous no no you'd have

8023.079 --> 8030.04
to pay him money to to hire him in a

8026.719 --> 8033.04
movie cuz he's going to ruin it

8030.04 --> 8033.04
guaranteed

8038.04 --> 8042.079
they refuse to do speed to

8044.8 --> 8050.04
why love to see a movie with Steven seal

8048.079 --> 8053.679
and

8050.04 --> 8055.639
why why the hell would

8053.679 --> 8058.639
what

8055.639 --> 8058.639
what

8060.04 --> 8063.04
okay

8080.119 --> 8085.92
One play yeah very yeah and that's fine

8082.92 --> 8085.92
he should have stuck to

8087.44 --> 8093.719
that and I mean to be fair Kiana Reeves

8090.8 --> 8096.559
I like him in

8093.719 --> 8101.4
uh what is it again the

8096.559 --> 8101.400000000001
stupid shooting hundreds of

8101.44 --> 8107.28
people the whole Jesuit thing I keep

8104.28 --> 8109.719
forgetting the name but I mean he is

8107.28 --> 8109.719
good in

8109.84 --> 8115.599
that he's good for

8112.28 --> 8119.04
that like that

8115.599 --> 8122.04
works just like the Matrix worked and

8119.04 --> 8126.5199999999995
that stuff works keep forgetting what's

8122.04 --> 8126.5199999999995
the [ __ ] is the name anybody remind

8126.92 --> 8133.52
me Jesuit stuff and just [ __ ]

8129.96 --> 8133.52
shooting hundreds of

8135.84 --> 8141.8
people what's it called again there's

8138.199 --> 8141.799999999999
like four movies of it now or

8145.76 --> 8149.719
something not cyber

8149.92 --> 8152.92
Punk

8156.599 --> 8166.159000000001
no not Constantine either it was

8161.92 --> 8170.639
okay I mean come on a movie franchise

8166.159 --> 8174.799999999999
there's four of them now Kiana Reeves is

8170.639 --> 8179.8
the head role in all those movies I

8174.8 --> 8179.8
mean how many options you got at that

8179.92 --> 8182.92
point

8197.519 --> 8203.2
conin was super best well I like Devil's

8199.76 --> 8206.16
Advocate I really liked him in that that

8203.2 --> 8208.880000000001
was a pretty good one so it's not like

8206.16 --> 8212.84
all of his movies suck but some of them

8208.88 --> 8212.839999999998
are just terrible

8217.84 --> 8221.439
is he Canadian what the

8225.02 --> 8228.12
[Music]

8228.88 --> 8237.119999999999
hell okay let's just I'm going to IMDb

8231.92 --> 8237.12
it because uh you guys refuse to tell

8238.519 --> 8243.92
me John Wick that's what I talking about

8242.439 --> 8247.599
John Wick

8243.92 --> 8247.599
series he's good in

8254.809 --> 8257.849
[Music]

8262.08 --> 8268.599
that right so like yeah that's he's cool

8266.639 --> 8271.16
in

8268.599 --> 8275.92
that it's a bit depressing but it kind

8271.16 --> 8279.399
of works it just it it kind of works in

8275.92 --> 8283.639
that but I mean for the love of God man

8279.399 --> 8286.439
like never try any kind of rle in which

8283.639 --> 8288.88
you have to have any form of expression

8286.439 --> 8292.319
ever again never do that

8288.88 --> 8297.24
again and any director that would hire

8292.319 --> 8297.24
him for that is out of their

8297.92 --> 8304.599
minds yeah like being black Paul over

8301.24 --> 8307.479
refusing speed too I'm sorry that only

8304.599 --> 8309.8
seems like an excuse they made just to

8307.479 --> 8312.479
like oh no no we don't want to hire him

8309.8 --> 8315.08
because of speed too yeah it's not

8312.479 --> 8317.358999999999
because he's like the worst actor of all

8315.08 --> 8321.559
time or anything Co it's because he

8317.359 --> 8321.559000000001
refused speed to

8328.8 --> 8338.24
yes ke not in W yeah I remember him

8333.28 --> 8338.24
being in this horrible horrible stupid

8339.24 --> 8343.76
film it was absolutely

8345.24 --> 8351.559
disgusting with these two teens and [ __ ]

8349.88 --> 8354.399
I don't even want to like talk about

8351.559 --> 8354.399
that it was so

8356.679 --> 8362.519
disgusting it was so disgusting it

8359.08 --> 8363.76
literally made me want to just like

8362.519 --> 8367.960000000001
shoot

8363.76 --> 8371.08
him just like quickly shoot him so that

8367.96 --> 8372.199999999999
none of that just gets gets released

8371.08 --> 8375.2
like

8372.2 --> 8375.2
that's

8378.8 --> 8386.319
atrocious was just creating a motorcycle

8382.599 --> 8387.76
Manufacturing Company okay I should

8386.319 --> 8392.56
probably stick to

8387.76 --> 8395.76
that I mean if k has any sense left in

8392.56 --> 8399.96
him he should just like kind of

8395.76 --> 8402.439
quit acting overall and just do a couple

8399.96 --> 8404.399
of these more stoic roles where he

8402.439 --> 8408.359
basically doesn't have to give any form

8404.399 --> 8413.358999999999
of expression to to do the role right

8408.359 --> 8416.880000000001
and just like do other stuff beside that

8413.359 --> 8420.319
because he should never attempt to act

8416.88 --> 8422.92
expressively ever again just never do

8420.319 --> 8425.96
that again dude

8422.92 --> 8428.52
never and I'm telling this like for your

8425.96 --> 8432.599999999999
own good I'm not mocking you it is

8428.52 --> 8432.6
horrific when you try it every

8433.23 --> 8436.359999999999
[Music]

8442.24 --> 8449.0
time Kristen Stewart who's that no idea

8446.6 --> 8449.0
who that

8449.64 --> 8452.64
is

8456.56 --> 8459.0
oh

8459.84 --> 8465.439
God

8461.56 --> 8468.039999999999
Jesus that that person yeah that's not a

8465.439 --> 8471.64
bad comparison break

8468.04 --> 8471.640000000001
toer I hate

8479.56 --> 8482.56
that

8486.19 --> 8492.479000000001
[Music]

8488.96 --> 8495.599999999999
no Kevlar no it's not just

8492.479 --> 8498.56
me and hey I already said he is pretty

8495.6 --> 8501.12
cool in some movies where he like

8498.56 --> 8504.8
doesn't have to have any form of

8501.12 --> 8508.720000000001
expression or emotion that's where it

8504.8 --> 8511.64
works he just needs to be professional

8508.72 --> 8514.039999999999
and sensible about it and avoid all

8511.64 --> 8515.8
character roles in which he has to

8514.04 --> 8520.560000000001
actually express

8515.8 --> 8522.8
feelings and avoid that like

8520.56 --> 8525.319
contractually like hey before I take

8522.8 --> 8527.039999999999
this like hey director yeah I like to

8525.319 --> 8529.359
audition for this role but there's

8527.04 --> 8532.080000000002
certain conditions

8529.359 --> 8534.68
like are you expecting me to like

8532.08 --> 8536.84
perform some kind of emotion like crying

8534.68 --> 8540.0
or strong compassionate feeling or

8536.84 --> 8542.16
anything because if you do I'm going to

8540.0 --> 8544.56
have to say no you're going to have to

8542.16 --> 8547.88
find another solution for that then like

8544.56 --> 8550.88
he should literally do that for his own

8547.88 --> 8553.839999999998
good and for the good of his audience

8550.88 --> 8556.759999999998
and his fans because he shouldn't

8553.84 --> 8558.52
continue torturing his fans with his

8556.76 --> 8561.6
horrendous

8558.52 --> 8565.28
acting and just stick to the more bland

8561.6 --> 8566.68
roles which he performs great in I mean

8565.28 --> 8570.16
I like

8566.68 --> 8572.92
him like I like him as John Wick he did

8570.16 --> 8575.6
great it's a good role for him I like

8572.92 --> 8579.52
him as Neo in the matrix it's a good

8575.6 --> 8581.92
role for him it really is except for the

8579.52 --> 8584.960000000001
last one which in which he is like too

8581.92 --> 8587.76
self-aware and he was just getting was

8584.96 --> 8591.519999999999
getting annoying but the original Matrix

8587.76 --> 8594.84
trilogy was fantastic he was great like

8591.52 --> 8598.880000000001
Bland and he needs to stay Bland he for

8594.84 --> 8602.72
his own brand he needs to stay

8598.88 --> 8606.199999999999
Bland and he needs to make that clear to

8602.72 --> 8609.479
any director that will hire him like Hey

8606.2 --> 8612.12
don't give me any Express emotional

8609.479 --> 8612.88
expression don't make me do that you'll

8612.12 --> 8616.399000000001
be

8612.88 --> 8618.8
sorry or simply I refuse to do that if

8616.399 --> 8621.68
you have any kind of scene in which I'm

8618.8 --> 8624.72
supposed to have emotional

8621.68 --> 8627.08
expression that's beyond just oh crying

8624.72 --> 8629.8
because I just lost Trinity like that is

8627.08 --> 8633.24
the that's as far as it goes like short

8629.8 --> 8636.679999999998
moment of cry cying and then move on

8633.24 --> 8638.72
right keep it very short no elaborate

8636.68 --> 8641.24
emotions no elaborate Expressions

8638.72 --> 8643.679999999998
because it's it's Poison every time he

8641.24 --> 8643.68
tries

8644.0 --> 8650.2
that so that's like I'm not joking this

8648.04 --> 8653.279
is not a joke to me I'm actually being

8650.2 --> 8653.279
really serious about

8654.56 --> 8659.359
this being a human yeah you shouldn't

8658.2 --> 8661.6
try

8659.359 --> 8662.92
that

8661.6 --> 8664.92
is it going to help with green

8662.92 --> 8668.68
motorcycle y screw that I don't even

8664.92 --> 8668.68
like motorcycles

8671.399 --> 8676.88
yeah I don't want a motorcycle get me a

8677.8 --> 8682.399
car cars are way more safe

8689.319 --> 8694.76
anyway

8691.56 --> 8698.0
besides I'm actually giving him serious

8694.76 --> 8701.76
advice I'm not just mocking Kiana Reeves

8698.0 --> 8705.96
okay Kara I'm being very serious he

8701.76 --> 8708.68
should at all cost for his own sake for

8705.96 --> 8709.56
his own career sake and for the sake of

8708.68 --> 8713.720000000001
his

8709.56 --> 8715.76
fandom avoid any kind of human

8713.72 --> 8719.039999999999
expression within the roles that he

8715.76 --> 8721.319
chooses he really really should do that

8719.04 --> 8725.04
it would be better for for him he would

8721.319 --> 8728.0
probably make more money if he did that

8725.04 --> 8730.439
even it's very serious

8728.0 --> 8733.12
advice yeah it sounds so funny and like

8730.439 --> 8734.399
ha so hilar yeah but it's really serious

8733.12 --> 8735.92
advice

8734.399 --> 8740.119999999999
though

8735.92 --> 8742.2
yeah it is it isn't a joke you can think

8740.12 --> 8745.479000000001
of it as a joke but it isn't meant as a

8742.2 --> 8745.479000000001
joke it's very serious

8747.55 --> 8751.438999999998
[Music]

8749.24 --> 8754.84
advice

8751.439 --> 8757.52
right and already expressed like I don't

8754.84 --> 8759.319
think he sucks in absolutely everything

8757.52 --> 8761.92
I liked him in the Matrix I think he

8759.319 --> 8766.359
does very well in the John Wick

8761.92 --> 8769.72
franchise why because he barely has

8766.359 --> 8774.24
human expression in it and that's better

8769.72 --> 8774.24
it's better for him as an

8779.24 --> 8782.24
actor

8784.88 --> 8789.319
yeah Devil's Advocate no he was great in

8787.72 --> 8793.519999999999
Devil's

8789.319 --> 8796.039999999999
Advocate why because he was like he had

8793.52 --> 8798.92
to hold back a lot he was like put under

8796.04 --> 8801.800000000001
a lot of pressure and he didn't like

8798.92 --> 8804.0
Express himself so much that was like

8801.8 --> 8806.96
the whole thing it was perfect for him

8804.0 --> 8806.96
he was great in

8808.0 --> 8814.24
that and besides he had the uh what's

8811.04 --> 8817.479000000001
the other actor's guy the actor name

8814.24 --> 8821.64
fantastic actor who played the devil in

8817.479 --> 8821.64
there he did all the

8822.08 --> 8831.12
expression keano was the

8825.84 --> 8834.08
recipient and it worked great it was

8831.12 --> 8837.240000000002
perfect that was Advocate is still like

8834.08 --> 8840.279
one of my more favorite

8837.24 --> 8843.56
movies especially like it's definitely

8840.279 --> 8843.560000000001
one of the better ones from the

8843.88 --> 8849.199999999999
90s Robert dairo what not [ __ ] Robert

8850.08 --> 8853.439
dairo he

8854.0 --> 8857.72
sucks it's the other

8864.56 --> 8871.479
one John trol is far worse than yeah

8867.88 --> 8874.759999999998
alucino that's right Rober

8871.479 --> 8878.479
Robert dero sucks I don't know a single

8874.76 --> 8881.2
movie in which he's good not a single

8878.479 --> 8884.96
one I find him very

8881.2 --> 8887.12
repulsive but that's for another day

8884.96 --> 8888.839999999998
John travolto might be terrible yeah

8887.12 --> 8891.279
well I don't really know that many

8888.84 --> 8894.68
movies he's even

8891.279 --> 8894.68
in so

8899.12 --> 8902.12
whatever

8924.399 --> 8928.399
God see Star you say

8928.479 --> 8934.479

8932.12 --> 8937.319000000001
staring piano and Kristen let's not do

8934.479 --> 8940.16

8937.319 --> 8940.16
even suggest

8946.319 --> 8950.64
that okay Ben Johnston

8952.64 --> 8955.64

9026.12 --> 9030.640000000001
also in

9027.439 --> 9035.68
that like like a Klingon sort of looks

9030.64 --> 9035.68

9039.0 --> 9048.84
weird it's like really bad but so but so

9044.96 --> 9048.839999999998
