153.66 --> 162.66
anyway

156.18 --> 162.66
it is Tuesday the 1st of February 2022.

162.72 --> 165.26
yeah

165.54 --> 171.84
and I was checking my bank account today

169.56 --> 173.7
and yeah

171.84 --> 177.0
if

173.7 --> 179.879
PayPal donations from yesterday hadn't

177.0 --> 182.04
gone through already today

179.879 --> 183.89999999999998
then I wouldn't have been able to pay my

182.04 --> 186.35999999999999
rent

183.9 --> 189.20000000000002
it's yeah

186.36 --> 189.20000000000002
it's what it is

190.68 --> 194.72
so yeah I kind of predicted that

200.04 --> 206.12
all right

202.5 --> 206.12
so yeah that was a bit of a bummer

206.94 --> 212.519
but

208.98 --> 214.56
yeah with the help of you guys and this

212.519 --> 218.36
is more donations

214.56 --> 218.36
I'll be able to keep going

218.64 --> 221.54
this month

223.68 --> 228.78
right

224.76 --> 231.85999999999999
because right now I have 15 euros yeah

228.78 --> 231.86
that's it

234.239 --> 239.22
I think I could do three days with that

237.599 --> 242.159
and then

239.22 --> 244.819
yeah anyway

242.159 --> 244.819
uh

245.099 --> 251.17999999999998
yesterday's letters debate was great and

248.04 --> 251.17999999999998
lasted very long

259.919 --> 265.68
uh what did we talk about again

263.16 --> 268.46000000000004
there were some Ballers on there if I

265.68 --> 268.46
remember correctly

278.58 --> 282.71999999999997
oh yeah by the way also scuba Dracula

281.4 --> 285.78
uploaded

282.72 --> 288.72
own Benjamin stream with the

285.78 --> 291.35999999999996
the Urban Farmer huh

288.72 --> 294.74
so I didn't know scuba Dracula was in in

291.36 --> 294.74
that too pretty cool

296.94 --> 299.9
uh

310.02 --> 312.56
right

313.32 --> 318.0
but yeah I'm still following own

315.12 --> 319.82
Benjamin and he's still on the ass of

318.0 --> 324.0
Canada

319.82 --> 326.88
pointing at the situation the long-term

324.0 --> 329.72
situation and it is kind of a little

326.88 --> 329.71999999999997
disheartening

337.08 --> 342.479
but yeah in the meantime the whole

339.6 --> 345.199
trucker thing is still going and in

342.479 --> 345.199
Europe as well

345.72 --> 349.759
at least it's being organized right now

366.78 --> 369.31899999999996
all right

371.28 --> 376.88
hey Kevlar kind of bear good to see you

378.72 --> 384.319
Jeff gashead

381.72 --> 384.319
right

391.8 --> 396.72
so at least today I didn't wake up right

394.68 --> 397.919
as my show should be starting so that

396.72 --> 400.699
that's

397.919 --> 400.69899999999996
that was something

408.36 --> 413.52000000000004
ah

410.759 --> 417.68
but yeah right right now I'm pretty much

413.52 --> 417.68
it a blank slate at this moment

419.88 --> 425.24
and yeah I got Financial worries on my

423.06 --> 425.24
mind

426.0 --> 430.74
yesterday was better

428.759 --> 432.72
I didn't check it

430.74 --> 434.40000000000003
but yeah I have to check it or it's

432.72 --> 437.639
gonna crash at some point and that's

434.4 --> 440.9
even worse way to figure it out so

437.639 --> 440.90000000000003
right uh

451.22 --> 458.28000000000003
watching ad for hello fresh right

455.58 --> 460.85999999999996
well it could be worse ads

458.28 --> 463.15999999999997
anyway hello Nathan Oakley 1980 good to

460.86 --> 463.16
see you

477.78 --> 479.96
foreign

484.46 --> 489.35999999999996
in the meantime Boris Johnson is still

487.919 --> 492.62
getting grilled

489.36 --> 492.62
through party gate

493.5 --> 498.84
George Soros is now calling for regime

497.039 --> 502.4
change in China

498.84 --> 502.4
like the [ __ ] dude

503.4 --> 508.69899999999996
it's almost got the feeling he wants to

505.319 --> 508.699
go out with a bang or something

509.94 --> 516.38
and this guy is not making himself

512.339 --> 516.3800000000001
popular as in anywhere

516.419 --> 519.38
it's crazy [ __ ]

522.779 --> 526.519
hey Adam Price good to see you

532.61 --> 535.71
[Music]

538.08 --> 541.0400000000001
uh

561.18 --> 565.26
right yeah

563.58 --> 568.5
I don't know sometimes you know

565.26 --> 571.68
sometimes in the evening I dream well I

568.5 --> 573.6
dream a lot it's like dream walking

571.68 --> 575.399
while watching media thinking about

573.6 --> 579.839
stuff reflecting

575.399 --> 583.14
sometimes it's very much focused on

579.839 --> 586.6800000000001
what's going on in the world and Happy

583.14 --> 589.16
Chinese New Year really is it

586.68 --> 589.16
huh

597.48 --> 602.4200000000001
tariffs the tiger is that today huh

602.76 --> 609.6
how typical that he would do that today

605.459 --> 611.64
then the guy is such an atrocity

609.6 --> 614.779
yeah

611.64 --> 614.779
hello Jesse

647.04 --> 653.06
all right well yeah happy New Year a

650.1 --> 653.0600000000001
Chinese people

660.48 --> 665.94
yeah yeah he did Adam Price I didn't

663.72 --> 669.9590000000001
even know it was Chinese New Year I just

665.94 --> 674.5400000000001
noticed that flicking through RT

669.959 --> 674.54
it's like yeah that

675.18 --> 682.2199999999999
and it was published on February 1 so

678.959 --> 682.2199999999999
here I'll post the link

712.62 --> 718.519
that's not very woke of me

715.139 --> 718.519
oh God how

749.519 --> 751.7
foreign

764.279 --> 767.3
good to see you

779.88 --> 783.959
supposed to know all of the cultural

782.279 --> 786.8
celebrations

783.959 --> 786.8
okay

803.1 --> 810.9200000000001
all right well pink book is what being

805.74 --> 810.92
woke is like being politically informed

813.66 --> 819.959
not about being

816.06 --> 821.2199999999999
like universally informed like The

819.959 --> 823.92
Awakening

821.22 --> 825.4200000000001
seeing things seeing things where what

823.92 --> 827.8199999999999
they really are

825.42 --> 831.06
seeing into the depths of the future

827.82 --> 835.1600000000001
because of it that's awake but woke is

831.06 --> 835.16
being more like politically informed

835.62 --> 842.76
so you know everything about

838.139 --> 846.0600000000001
according to its system you have to

842.76 --> 849.8389999999999
what do you have to be for and against

846.06 --> 852.4799999999999
crazy it's like a massive

849.839 --> 855.5400000000001
propaganda

852.48 --> 859.82
religion it really is like a propaganda

855.54 --> 859.8199999999999
religion woke it is

864.48 --> 868.399
right or a political religion

870.839 --> 876.899
which like combining those words is

874.56 --> 880.0999999999999
already kind of scary like because those

876.899 --> 880.1
should not belong together

880.62 --> 883.22
right

899.82 --> 905.279
woke is deep sleep no but it's not

902.279 --> 907.62
really though people that are woke

905.279 --> 910.4399999999999
do it with a certain purpose or reason

907.62 --> 914.1
it's more like a

910.44 --> 916.0790000000001
personal corporate investment people

914.1 --> 918.24
that are woke are woke for a reason

916.079 --> 921.68
they're never woke for actual

918.24 --> 921.6800000000001
ideological reasons

922.079 --> 927.8389999999999
they're there to pretend all that

926.16 --> 929.88
because

927.839 --> 932.1
you can't really

929.88 --> 934.579
feel that

932.1 --> 934.5790000000001
anymore

935.04 --> 942.18
it's only about politics

938.639 --> 944.88
and that usually turns to it's usually

942.18 --> 947.3389999999999
about destroying who you perceive to be

944.88 --> 948.899
the enemy not to help

947.339 --> 951.48
those

948.899 --> 953.339
you want to be your friend or think

951.48 --> 955.98
you're are on your side it's not even

953.339 --> 958.639
about that it's just about destroying

955.98 --> 958.639
your enemies

959.94 --> 965.1
that's what it comes down to but the

962.399 --> 969.36
people that do it they do it for

965.1 --> 971.6990000000001
business reasons in a way and

969.36 --> 974.22
yeah that's real

971.699 --> 975.5999999999999
but it's even start out very young like

974.22 --> 978.6
the ones that are like yeah I'm woke

975.6 --> 981.899
they think the reason they Embrace that

978.6 --> 984.24
because they were fooled into or came to

981.899 --> 986.279
their own conclusion that it is the

984.24 --> 988.259
future if I'm getting real I'm going to

986.279 --> 991.139
be really good at that it's gonna give

988.259 --> 993.0
me an advantage in the society that they

991.139 --> 994.38
think is coming

993.0 --> 997.079
right

994.38 --> 1000.16
you don't become woke because you

997.079 --> 1000.16
actually believe that

1000.56 --> 1006.5
like it'll break down really quickly

1003.98 --> 1008.66
because if you're actually

1006.5 --> 1011.74
deep inside you want to help people

1008.66 --> 1014.66
because spark a God right natural

1011.74 --> 1017.24
behavior wouldn't be good

1014.66 --> 1018.86
you'll just figure out that woke is

1017.24 --> 1021.74
complete crap

1018.86 --> 1023.839
at the first opportunity because it like

1021.74 --> 1027.199
it's

1023.839 --> 1029.6000000000001
dubious double-thinking nature is

1027.199 --> 1031.699
constantly revealed

1029.6 --> 1034.3999999999999
so the only reason to really stick

1031.699 --> 1037.66
behind it is for like

1034.4 --> 1040.4
political corporate reasons like

1037.66 --> 1043.64
Investments reason

1040.4 --> 1047.0590000000002
right haven't you noticed that

1043.64 --> 1049.64
about people that are actually woke

1047.059 --> 1053.78
they don't actually believe it they're

1049.64 --> 1055.5200000000002
just really investing into acting like

1053.78 --> 1057.08
they believe it because they think they

1055.52 --> 1058.9
can get something out of it in the

1057.08 --> 1061.52
future

1058.9 --> 1063.5590000000002
that's the preponderance of my

1061.52 --> 1067.059
experience with every form of work is

1063.559 --> 1067.059
that it is exactly that

1068.6 --> 1072.9189999999999
and

1070.1 --> 1074.8999999999999
sometimes it's just like automated

1072.919 --> 1077.919
Behavior out of pure fear but then it's

1074.9 --> 1077.919
superficial it's like

1078.44 --> 1083.059
insecure woman or something might act

1081.98 --> 1085.58
woke

1083.059 --> 1088.3999999999999
on the surface right but if you then

1085.58 --> 1091.1
like take things more serious you tap

1088.4 --> 1093.0800000000002
get closer they'll stop doing that

1091.1 --> 1097.8799999999999
because it's like

1093.08 --> 1099.62
fear spawns nervousness Behavior

1097.88 --> 1101.72
they just wouldn't be part of the system

1099.62 --> 1104.78
perceived system

1101.72 --> 1107.0
it at such a moment it's not really like

1104.78 --> 1108.98
they seriously believe it it's just

1107.0 --> 1111.02
superficial Behavior

1108.98 --> 1113.48
this is spawned from the same source as

1111.02 --> 1117.62
those that eventually become woke and

1113.48 --> 1121.0
infest in it with their spirit

1117.62 --> 1121.0
for political and

1121.039 --> 1124.539
and business reasons

1140.66 --> 1146.299
just sounds like false narrative Psy of

1144.26 --> 1148.039
put out by the tribe to divide and

1146.299 --> 1150.799
conquer okay

1148.039 --> 1152.78
now it was a corporate system it's

1150.799 --> 1158.059
a business cult

1152.78 --> 1162.6789999999999
I think that sjw woke I think it is

1158.059 --> 1166.82
it came from the corporate world

1162.679 --> 1168.799
or communism in conjunction with the

1166.82 --> 1170.96
corporate world because a lot of the

1168.799 --> 1174.44
corporate world became

1170.96 --> 1177.02
communist adjacent

1174.44 --> 1179.24
for

1177.02 --> 1181.1
insane reasons

1179.24 --> 1183.32
some of which is like oh we have to

1181.1 --> 1186.08
adapt to China

1183.32 --> 1188.72
right but that might have just been the

1186.08 --> 1191.72
excuse to go there right it might have

1188.72 --> 1194.539
been just like oh they wanted everybody

1191.72 --> 1196.88
to become more like Communists because

1194.539 --> 1198.86
they want to freaking take them over and

1196.88 --> 1202.2800000000002
be the new nobility their rules over

1198.86 --> 1204.799
them can squish them like a bug

1202.28 --> 1207.2
without any recourse that's what they

1204.799 --> 1209.72
really secretly want but at the time is

1207.2 --> 1211.64
like oh but China's the new Power oh we

1209.72 --> 1213.32
have to adapt

1211.64 --> 1215.1200000000001
and then everybody's like oh [ __ ]

1213.32 --> 1217.9399999999998
China's the big Power okay we'll guess

1215.12 --> 1221.4799999999998
we have to adapt right so they tricked

1217.94 --> 1224.2
everybody into it

1221.48 --> 1224.2
they did

1225.159 --> 1231.919
you tricked everybody into becoming more

1230.179 --> 1234.14
communist and to accept that and

1231.919 --> 1237.74
normalize that

1234.14 --> 1239.659
because that's what they do it's

1237.74 --> 1242.26
it's theirs

1239.659 --> 1242.2600000000002
yeah

1242.659 --> 1252.7600000000002
Four Horsemen of the eclipse it's theirs

1247.88 --> 1252.7600000000002
they they claimed it

1252.799 --> 1258.7
first ignore Christ turn inside out the

1256.46 --> 1258.7
world

1259.1 --> 1263.7199999999998
take away

1260.44 --> 1265.28
the social family relationships through

1263.72 --> 1266.659
communism

1265.28 --> 1268.82
right

1266.659 --> 1270.8600000000001
and then finally

1268.82 --> 1273.86
take away the body

1270.86 --> 1273.86
transhumanism

1273.919 --> 1277.179
the design from God

1280.88 --> 1287.0590000000002
right so every

1283.82 --> 1289.12
proclaimed Jew that I've ever met they

1287.059 --> 1290.8999999999999
were all

1289.12 --> 1294.02
pro-communist

1290.9 --> 1296.179
right even though that is quite insane

1294.02 --> 1298.6589999999999
if you put it next to like the Old

1296.179 --> 1298.659
Testament

1299.36 --> 1304.9399999999998
all right that doesn't match at all and

1301.76 --> 1306.62
that's why I say those people that call

1304.94 --> 1307.76
themselves Jew I don't think they're

1306.62 --> 1310.1589999999999
Jews

1307.76 --> 1312.94
they're not they're just using it as an

1310.159 --> 1312.94
excuse front

1328.1 --> 1333.039
anyway

1330.2 --> 1333.039
uh

1333.5 --> 1337.539
yeah work is a terrible idea

1337.58 --> 1343.46
it's

1339.5 --> 1347.799
it's kind of in a way prison culture

1343.46 --> 1347.799
like World present culture

1348.14 --> 1355.039
people start doing it because they are

1351.38 --> 1358.9
or they perceive they are forced to

1355.039 --> 1358.9
they have to do that to

1359.059 --> 1363.94
to yeah to make it in the future

1367.64 --> 1371.98
all right what's the J in my name

1374.299 --> 1383.539
well it's one verb i j

1378.2 --> 1384.6200000000001
it's the Y except it's the other y it's

1383.539 --> 1387.4
dutch

1384.62 --> 1387.3999999999999
European

1389.419 --> 1395.24
right so effectively

1392.419 --> 1397.419
to a the English language it's a silent

1395.24 --> 1397.419
J

1400.22 --> 1410.24
right in Dutch we pronounce that i j

1404.36 --> 1412.34
a a a a a a a a a a a a yeah good luck

1410.24 --> 1414.2
with that I'm not expecting anybody

1412.34 --> 1416.36
outside of a Dutch person to be able to

1414.2 --> 1419.919
say that

1416.36 --> 1419.9189999999999
but that's how it is

1420.26 --> 1426.86
it's not a name I made up

1423.559 --> 1428.779
it's the name my mother gave me

1426.86 --> 1431.74
it's really my name

1428.779 --> 1431.74
a middle name

1434.299 --> 1439.299
right

1436.52 --> 1439.299
uh

1461.559 --> 1466.039
yeah yeah life

1463.94 --> 1470.24
you're having a croissant for breakfast

1466.039 --> 1472.64
and for some reason listening to my show

1470.24 --> 1475.34
after such a long time yeah what what

1472.64 --> 1478.2990000000002
kept you away you've missed a lot of

1475.34 --> 1478.299
interesting shows

1486.44 --> 1490.72
ah okay yeah Rick back no problem

1503.72 --> 1511.7
yes Vengeance from the Archangel Michael

1507.44 --> 1513.559
it's not Vengeance it's vengans I don't

1511.7 --> 1516.1000000000001
know why you misspelled that and it's

1513.559 --> 1516.1
really weird

1533.9 --> 1537.64
right but yeah

1538.22 --> 1542.72
it's like this

1540.02 --> 1547.52
communism technically

1542.72 --> 1549.44
in a very small and isolated community

1547.52 --> 1551.84
works great

1549.44 --> 1555.8600000000001
as long as it's small and isolated

1551.84 --> 1557.8999999999999
everybody stays the [ __ ] out of it and

1555.86 --> 1561.3799999999999
leaves them alone

1557.9 --> 1563.179
right that works great small community

1561.38 --> 1567.4
it's a good

1563.179 --> 1571.88
very natural way to to live actually

1567.4 --> 1572.779
if everybody else stays the [ __ ] out of

1571.88 --> 1574.8200000000002
it

1572.779 --> 1578.2
don't meddle with it

1574.82 --> 1580.96
right because as soon as business and

1578.2 --> 1585.14
politics get involved it becomes

1580.96 --> 1586.7
absolutely [ __ ] and I mean absolutely

1585.14 --> 1590.419
[ __ ]

1586.7 --> 1593.779
always turns into a giant giant disaster

1590.419 --> 1597.5590000000002
everybody loses their Spirit loses their

1593.779 --> 1599.659
mind and ends up eventually losing their

1597.559 --> 1602.48
life

1599.659 --> 1604.5200000000002
starting with basically the the

1602.48 --> 1606.8600000000001
diminishing of the population because

1604.52 --> 1609.679
they don't live natural anymore at some

1606.86 --> 1611.84
point don't have kids anymore are

1609.679 --> 1614.9
demoralized and then eventually

1611.84 --> 1618.1399999999999
something happens and they all die

1614.9 --> 1619.6000000000001
that's the inevitable fate

1618.14 --> 1623.3200000000002
of

1619.6 --> 1623.32
non-isolated communism

1632.4 --> 1639.19
[Music]

1635.57 --> 1639.1899999999998
[Applause]

1639.46 --> 1646.24
no ven guns is not

1643.159 --> 1646.24
spelled properly

1657.919 --> 1662.6000000000001
two

1660.2 --> 1665.2
no you spelled it wrong it's with an e

1662.6 --> 1665.1999999999998
and an a

1677.299 --> 1681.74
all right why do rich people want

1679.159 --> 1686.2990000000002
communism because

1681.74 --> 1688.58
in a communist system they can loot the

1686.299 --> 1692.36
population communism

1688.58 --> 1694.82
in a way has become just the the modern

1692.36 --> 1697.9399999999998
feudalism

1694.82 --> 1701.84
and Rich Communists are the ones that

1697.94 --> 1703.76
literally just squeeze and rob their

1701.84 --> 1705.86
people

1703.76 --> 1707.419
they rob the peon that's why they like

1705.86 --> 1710.12
it so much

1707.419 --> 1712.94
because they literally just like use

1710.12 --> 1715.6399999999999
them and abuse them like slaves for

1712.94 --> 1717.44
their own selfish gain that's why they

1715.64 --> 1721.46
like it so much because they're

1717.44 --> 1723.919
disgusting evil bastards that have

1721.46 --> 1727.159
absolutely no respect

1723.919 --> 1730.419
for human life or any sort of life or

1727.159 --> 1730.419
anything at all ever

1737.35 --> 1741.619
[Music]

1745.7 --> 1750.559
no no no no it can't be you're just

1749.299 --> 1753.02
wrong

1750.559 --> 1755.539
no

1753.02 --> 1759.1399999999999
have you tried Googling it try Googling

1755.539 --> 1761.179
it exactly as you spelled it yeah you

1759.14 --> 1764.3600000000001
know what popped up

1761.179 --> 1766.88
a dictionary thing it's like oh yeah ven

1764.36 --> 1769.399
guns yeah yeah in the actual description

1766.88 --> 1771.919
it's spelled correctly with an EA though

1769.399 --> 1775.1789999999999
because that's how you spell it it's the

1771.919 --> 1775.179
only way you spell it

1778.059 --> 1784.1
Vengeance with Justin a is only

1782.059 --> 1788.44
misspelled it's misspelled that's not

1784.1 --> 1788.4399999999998
how you spell it it's wrong you're wrong

1788.48 --> 1794.919
correct your account name

1791.96 --> 1794.919
because you're wrong

1814.1 --> 1819.1999999999998
so

1816.14 --> 1822.98
oh yeah oh it's your first yeah well get

1819.2 --> 1825.679
the [ __ ] out of here then [ __ ]

1822.98 --> 1828.26
first language

1825.679 --> 1831.7
yeah I'm better at your language than

1828.26 --> 1831.7
you are and you're now banned

1832.399 --> 1838.82
for misspelling the word vengeance

1836.299 --> 1842.26
and doubling down on that retardation

1838.82 --> 1842.26
which is unacceptable

1856.76 --> 1863.96
and especially you you dare misspell

1861.26 --> 1867.98
that word and then stick it to the

1863.96 --> 1870.94
Archangel Michael you ass

1867.98 --> 1870.94
you're an ass

1883.399 --> 1887.0189999999998
hey Lydia logs

1887.779 --> 1894.46
Lydia jogs sorry it's hard to get rid of

1891.98 --> 1894.46
that habit

1900.5 --> 1902.84
right

1901.7 --> 1905.48
yeah

1902.84 --> 1907.82
it is what it is I did check it I

1905.48 --> 1911.24
already knew it I just double checked

1907.82 --> 1914.24
like oh is it without an e is that

1911.24 --> 1916.159
acceptable yeah and did give results and

1914.24 --> 1918.799
in all the texts

1916.159 --> 1920.779
all the text like underneath the direct

1918.799 --> 1928.4189999999999
result hit

1920.779 --> 1928.419
it all was spelled with EA so no just no

1928.94 --> 1934.779
if you didn't give me lit well go [ __ ]

1931.399 --> 1934.779
yourself and get the [ __ ] out

1957.7 --> 1964.8400000000001
scooty poof Junior what where did you

1961.76 --> 1964.84
read that Adam Price

1967.1 --> 1973.34
yeah yeah Lydia jokes

1969.799 --> 1976.82
yeah I knew Vengeance was was what was

1973.34 --> 1980.36
within EA before Google

1976.82 --> 1984.519
right I got English in school I was very

1980.36 --> 1984.519
good at it took it very serious

2013.24 --> 2016.08
ah

2022.6 --> 2028.019
right

2024.46 --> 2028.019
so yeah that happened

2041.14 --> 2044.14
what

2044.44 --> 2048.0
when you're talking about Enterprise

2082.659 --> 2089.079
oh my God

2084.76 --> 2091.0200000000004
oh they're coming after Joe Rogan

2089.079 --> 2094.8590000000004
because he's spreading medical

2091.02 --> 2094.859
misinformation oh

2100.0 --> 2104.099
Spotify is coming after him

2105.52 --> 2112.18
I've heard that Spotify since they've

2108.099 --> 2115.1800000000003
done this had like a record losses

2112.18 --> 2115.18
record

2115.359 --> 2121.98
so it's all these insane doubling down

2119.26 --> 2121.98
woke

2122.079 --> 2127.32
medical industrial shills are literally

2126.04 --> 2130.56
just

2127.32 --> 2134.04
destroying themselves like ravaging

2130.56 --> 2134.04
their own power

2134.98 --> 2141.339
it's it's insane like why would you do

2137.619 --> 2144.579
all that why would you keep going

2141.339 --> 2147.4
and like put in so much energy and

2144.579 --> 2151.6600000000003
effort on something you know will end up

2147.4 --> 2155.619
bad for you and they keep doing it

2151.66 --> 2155.6189999999997
they're just self-destructing

2173.02 --> 2177.839
yeah Matthew it's all preposterous

2178.66 --> 2184.54
and hey I thank Joe because he's the one

2181.48 --> 2187.42
that actually started calling I

2184.54 --> 2190.3
I've uh you know

2187.42 --> 2192.52
horse dewormer which was like the

2190.3 --> 2195.1600000000003
perfect trick

2192.52 --> 2199.06
that allows me to now just mention it

2195.16 --> 2201.0989999999997
right say oh I had a horse dewormer and

2199.06 --> 2204.339
thanks to Joe

2201.099 --> 2207.1600000000003
everybody gets that now

2204.339 --> 2209.14
everybody can use that so he basically

2207.16 --> 2213.18
bypassed

2209.14 --> 2216.46
the algorithm in censorship against

2213.18 --> 2219.8799999999997
well the what the horse dewormer is and

2216.46 --> 2222.099
the the miracle cure that it actually is

2219.88 --> 2224.92
for so many things

2222.099 --> 2229.32
so I thank Joe for that even though he's

2224.92 --> 2229.32
kind of in ways a ridiculous character

2230.079 --> 2236.38
he has

2232.839 --> 2239.0789999999997
done some good things that have lasting

2236.38 --> 2241.5
good effects it's not all just fat and

2239.079 --> 2241.5
hype

2253.72 --> 2258.839
right yeah Matthew no I don't follow Joe

2256.06 --> 2258.839
Rogan at all

2258.94 --> 2263.38
most of the time I get to hear something

2261.16 --> 2266.0789999999997
about him it actually kind of makes me

2263.38 --> 2270.28
want to throw up

2266.079 --> 2273.2400000000002
he crosses lines that I just would do

2270.28 --> 2273.2400000000002
not accept that

2273.94 --> 2278.7000000000003
but yeah it's his freaking life his

2276.4 --> 2278.7000000000003
problem

2292.0 --> 2299.76
right but yeah I will I like details and

2295.9 --> 2299.76
then point out how it's wrong and I have

2300.22 --> 2309.24
but overall I still think that

2304.18 --> 2309.24
his presence can still have good effects

2309.579 --> 2314.8590000000004
on the long run

2311.44 --> 2318.06
even though the negative influences are

2314.859 --> 2318.06
also there visible

2331.9 --> 2335.26
yeah the moon landing [ __ ] that was

2334.18 --> 2339.24
ridiculous

2335.26 --> 2339.2400000000002
it's because Joe is just

2339.7 --> 2344.8199999999997
he it seems let's even talked about

2349.54 --> 2356.32
and own Benjamin too was talking about

2351.7 --> 2361.54
it he's just trying to stay neutral

2356.32 --> 2365.04
in the face of pure polarized autocrats

2361.54 --> 2367.119
and that doesn't work you can't play

2365.04 --> 2370.56
neutral ball

2367.119 --> 2375.2200000000003
with psychotic

2370.56 --> 2378.099
demonic dictator types it doesn't work

2375.22 --> 2379.54
because they don't care they don't care

2378.099 --> 2381.04
if you want to find the middle of the

2379.54 --> 2383.98
ground it's like

2381.04 --> 2386.619
they just want you to either be or their

2383.98 --> 2389.82
slave or their enemy and that's like the

2386.619 --> 2389.82
only option they give you

2392.74 --> 2399.3999999999996
so it's kind of foolish

2395.92 --> 2401.079
of Joe Rogan to keep on upholding that

2399.4 --> 2403.54
stance

2401.079 --> 2405.46
even though it it is kind of it works

2403.54 --> 2407.68
out for him on average and that's

2405.46 --> 2409.9
probably why he's holding on to that way

2407.68 --> 2413.859
of doing things

2409.9 --> 2416.64
but in some cases it's just a complete

2413.859 --> 2416.64
waste of energy

2452.38 --> 2457.319
just because their military rifle got

2454.66 --> 2457.319
there first

2458.26 --> 2463.48
well

2460.54 --> 2465.7599999999998
you got to realize like even that the

2463.48 --> 2467.98
entire motivation behind it right so

2465.76 --> 2470.5
it's all about the whole moon landing

2467.98 --> 2472.18
supposedly and that space journey space

2470.5 --> 2474.819
race

2472.18 --> 2477.8799999999997
it was all about Prestige so if somebody

2474.819 --> 2481.18
else got there first yeah you could

2477.88 --> 2484.6600000000003
technically achieve that too

2481.18 --> 2486.64
but they already got all the Euphoria

2484.66 --> 2490.0
and like the awe

2486.64 --> 2492.4
because they got there first

2490.0 --> 2494.74
so in a way it does make sense

2492.4 --> 2497.94
especially for the amount of effort it

2494.74 --> 2497.9399999999996
would have cost back then

2499.06 --> 2503.4
but also I think that

2503.5 --> 2511.599
like even within the Soviet Union

2507.16 --> 2516.2799999999997
it was kept much higher a secret

2511.599 --> 2520.06
like even among its internal ranks

2516.28 --> 2522.579
that space was fake I think they more

2520.06 --> 2525.5789999999997
people in the Soviet Union at the time

2522.579 --> 2528.52
actually believed in space and that the

2525.579 --> 2532.54
moon was a place you could land on

2528.52 --> 2535.78
so it was much harder to just fake it

2532.54 --> 2538.98
because the Americans they kind of like

2535.78 --> 2538.98
they knew

2539.44 --> 2543.7000000000003
like this is [ __ ] it's not gonna

2541.72 --> 2545.68
work and then they just did it anyway

2543.7 --> 2547.96
and they just and they could rush it

2545.68 --> 2549.52
because they knew it was fake

2547.96 --> 2551.68
they just did it

2549.52 --> 2554.319
and they just they basically bluffed it

2551.68 --> 2557.0789999999997
and it kind of worked thanks to the

2554.319 --> 2558.819
level of Technology of the time and

2557.079 --> 2562.0
freshly

2558.819 --> 2563.68
fresh batch of New Media victims through

2562.0 --> 2565.599
television that was getting super

2563.68 --> 2568.1189999999997
popular

2565.599 --> 2570.339
and the mind control coming with it so

2568.119 --> 2572.619
it was a bluff and it really worked at

2570.339 --> 2576.119
that moment and the Russians just

2572.619 --> 2576.119
couldn't keep up with that

2578.619 --> 2583.06
and yeah once the Americans achieved

2580.96 --> 2587.339
that it was no point there was no point

2583.06 --> 2587.339
like trying to get there as well because

2590.319 --> 2594.04
like

2591.94 --> 2596.619
well they couldn't do it they couldn't

2594.04 --> 2598.3
do it for real

2596.619 --> 2600.46
even though I think that they probably

2598.3 --> 2602.619
wanted to do it for real

2600.46 --> 2606.099
but then the people that would become

2602.619 --> 2608.079
like responsible for actual the trickery

2606.099 --> 2611.7400000000002
of Faking a moon landing

2608.079 --> 2613.96
there would probably be very afraid

2611.74 --> 2616.06
because it was found out that they were

2613.96 --> 2618.7
actually tricking even though they did

2616.06 --> 2620.0789999999997
it for Russia or something for the

2618.7 --> 2623.3799999999997
Soviet Union

2620.079 --> 2624.76
they would still be in afraid of their

2623.38 --> 2627.28
lives

2624.76 --> 2630.099
because they basically lied

2627.28 --> 2632.38
in America is different

2630.099 --> 2634.6600000000003
they all knew like yeah we're we're

2632.38 --> 2636.819
Faking It For America it was like the

2634.66 --> 2639.7799999999997
government

2636.819 --> 2639.7799999999997
was it on it

2641.2 --> 2645.819
in Russia I don't know if they were I

2643.66 --> 2649.48
think it was much more compartmentalized

2645.819 --> 2651.64
might be wrong though it just it's very

2649.48 --> 2654.359
hard to really figure out what had

2651.64 --> 2654.359
happened and why

2654.94 --> 2660.819
and I don't think it really was like a a

2658.0 --> 2662.5
super friendly Friendship open

2660.819 --> 2665.2599999999998
communicated

2662.5 --> 2668.02
project

2665.26 --> 2670.6600000000003
that was pretending to compete I think

2668.02 --> 2672.7
the competition was real

2670.66 --> 2675.64
and the mindsets from the different

2672.7 --> 2677.9199999999996
nations were yeah they were very

2675.64 --> 2682.44
different so it all rolled out different

2677.92 --> 2682.44
the theatrics rolled out differently

2694.119 --> 2696.599
right

2699.28 --> 2704.46
uh but yeah it's all in the past anyway

2705.88 --> 2712.839
Russia has definitely caught up

2709.18 --> 2716.2599999999998
on that it's fake and I think that what

2712.839 --> 2720.2999999999997
they have been doing thus far is like

2716.26 --> 2720.3
much more effective theatrics

2722.26 --> 2726.7000000000003
I think that what Russia has been doing

2724.3 --> 2730.98
with space has been much more effective

2726.7 --> 2730.98
than what NASA has been doing with space

2733.96 --> 2737.099
I said it

2754.78 --> 2757.7400000000002
the name again

2760.78 --> 2768.1600000000003
oh yeah Ross Cosmos that's that's like

2764.5 --> 2771.28
space that's Russian NASA

2768.16 --> 2775.6189999999997
I think that they've they're great well

2771.28 --> 2775.619
great they're still fakery but

2783.099 --> 2785.76
hmm

2792.339 --> 2797.5
I wonder how much they they've cost

2794.859 --> 2800.7599999999998
overall compared to NASA I think they're

2797.5 --> 2800.76
probably a lot cheaper too

2808.06 --> 2810.72
anyway

2846.94 --> 2852.94
if it was for Prestige they would have

2850.48 --> 2857.079
made it bigger show yeah but Matthew

2852.94 --> 2862.7400000000002
Hall my point was I don't think that

2857.079 --> 2862.7400000000002
Soviet Union was really in the full no

2865.599 --> 2872.2200000000003
that it yeah that it wasn't actually

2869.319 --> 2872.22
possible

2910.9 --> 2915.059
what are you talking about Cana bear

2948.099 --> 2954.099
like seriously Canada what the hell are

2952.48 --> 2956.559
you talking about

2954.099 --> 2960.9
it's like one of the most random things

2956.559 --> 2960.9
I've ever seen anybody say in my chat

2960.94 --> 2967.96
toward in the stone when Merlin gets mad

2964.839 --> 2970.18
in sword in stone he blasts off like a

2967.96 --> 2972.88
rocket making a parabolic Arctic Bermuda

2970.18 --> 2973.96
like what the [ __ ] are you blabbering

2972.88 --> 2977.4
about

2973.96 --> 2977.4
are you high or something

2983.92 --> 2990.059
yeah they're typing twice is not the

2986.38 --> 2990.059
most disturbing part about that

2998.859 --> 3001.04
foreign

3005.7 --> 3008.359
what

3010.079 --> 3013.4
why are you bringing that up

3015.059 --> 3019.94
like what does that have to do with

3017.4 --> 3019.94
anything

3021.48 --> 3024.67
[Music]

3054.42 --> 3061.559
oh yuck really

3057.42 --> 3065.2400000000002
that's in a cartoon that's disgusting

3061.559 --> 3065.2400000000002
that's really disgusting

3065.4 --> 3069.78
like Merlin would ever be a [ __ ]

3067.8 --> 3071.76
baller [ __ ] off

3069.78 --> 3075.5400000000004
there's no way in hell

3071.76 --> 3078.6600000000003
you can't even have those secrets

3075.54 --> 3082.68
if you let your mind wander off into

3078.66 --> 3085.44
insane delusional land like you lies

3082.68 --> 3087.7799999999997
make you lose power

3085.44 --> 3089.3
they make you lose actual intellectual

3087.78 --> 3092.46
power

3089.3 --> 3095.3390000000004
lies wear you down and then the entire

3092.46 --> 3099.26
thing that yields that yields quality

3095.339 --> 3102.5589999999997
ideas it diminishes lies literally

3099.26 --> 3102.559
diminishes you

3102.78 --> 3107.8190000000004
that's why

3105.0 --> 3110.7
Wizards actual wizards they have to

3107.819 --> 3111.96
always talk the truth

3110.7 --> 3115.0789999999997
or

3111.96 --> 3118.2
they lie and then they become miserable

3115.079 --> 3121.6400000000003
little witches

3118.2 --> 3121.64
there's no in between

3126.18 --> 3132.18
and they know like Wizards always know

3130.02 --> 3136.4
whether it is a lie or not

3132.18 --> 3136.3999999999996
if they don't then they're not a wizard

3138.0 --> 3141.68
so that's just gross

3148.319 --> 3155.7
Maryland teaching about the ball Earth

3151.76 --> 3159.2400000000002
[ __ ] [ __ ] there's no way in hell

3155.7 --> 3162.839
that Merlin would ever do that

3159.24 --> 3165.2999999999997
not that the entire story myth Legend is

3162.839 --> 3168.38
real in a literal sense but

3165.3 --> 3168.38
it's ridiculous

3169.5 --> 3177.96
like I savagely hate that part about

3173.339 --> 3180.0589999999997
Globe belief like this projection back

3177.96 --> 3181.68
into the past like the old stores oh

3180.059 --> 3185.1600000000003
look this person is really smart oh

3181.68 --> 3186.839
let's make an extra scene how in the

3185.16 --> 3190.44
time when everybody believed the Earth

3186.839 --> 3193.4
was flat oh he was so smart he already

3190.44 --> 3199.859
knew it was a global

3193.4 --> 3202.8
yeah I hate that it's disgusting

3199.859 --> 3204.96
I hate it so much when when I bump into

3202.8 --> 3208.92
that [ __ ]

3204.96 --> 3209.819
no the globe isn't [ __ ] smart in the

3208.92 --> 3212.94
past

3209.819 --> 3216.54
people didn't have that secret knowledge

3212.94 --> 3220.16
if they had they knew it was evil and of

3216.54 --> 3220.16
the devil and dangerous

3221.339 --> 3223.94
like

3226.099 --> 3232.819
the church persecuted the globe

3229.38 --> 3236.579
Believers no no they didn't

3232.819 --> 3239.52
they were the globe believers they were

3236.579 --> 3242.579
the ones rolling that [ __ ] out and then

3239.52 --> 3244.94
the internal Community still having some

3242.579 --> 3248.2200000000003
sensibility left

3244.94 --> 3253.68
rejected it they were protesting against

3248.22 --> 3258.48
it yeah the church did not do that they

3253.68 --> 3260.04
were promoting that wizard [ __ ]

3258.48 --> 3263.18
yeah

3260.04 --> 3266.46
that's why all these people famous for

3263.18 --> 3268.5589999999997
discovering all the orbital mechanics

3266.46 --> 3271.319
blah blah blah

3268.559 --> 3274.6800000000003
Globe mechanics yeah that's why they

3271.319 --> 3280.2599999999998
were not like oh they were in a Catholic

3274.68 --> 3283.6189999999997
no no they were part of the church

3280.26 --> 3286.559
because the church was the one doing it

3283.619 --> 3289.2000000000003
not the one persecuting it

3286.559 --> 3291.059
it's ridiculous

3289.2 --> 3295.0789999999997
everything is turned inside out

3291.059 --> 3297.8390000000004
everything is a lie

3295.079 --> 3299.299
everything they turn inside out

3297.839 --> 3303.619
every every

3299.299 --> 3308.04
conceivable little Trope idea little

3303.619 --> 3311.46
innocent seeming habit it's all there

3308.04 --> 3314.119
turn inside out satanic lie everything

3311.46 --> 3319.319
taught to you about

3314.119 --> 3322.6800000000003
world history religion uh like geography

3319.319 --> 3324.66
it's all a lie they turn everything

3322.68 --> 3327.0589999999997
inside out

3324.66 --> 3330.299
whenever you read

3327.059 --> 3335.0400000000004
oh the church was persecuting uh

3330.299 --> 3338.28
Copernicus no no no no no no no no

3335.04 --> 3344.18
the church hired Copernicus

3338.28 --> 3344.1800000000003
he was theirs he was their agent

3366.839 --> 3372.0
good wizards are wise bad ones are

3370.38 --> 3374.7200000000003
sorcerers

3372.0 --> 3374.72
okay

3376.619 --> 3379.46
uh

3380.94 --> 3384.299
don't understand the drain of thought

3382.859 --> 3387.2
behind that

3384.299 --> 3387.2
but fine

3388.92 --> 3396.059
I think that the difference is that

3391.319 --> 3398.22
Wizards mostly read Wizards are all

3396.059 --> 3401.099
about Gathering

3398.22 --> 3404.2799999999997
and researching information

3401.099 --> 3406.579
and communication itself the magic of

3404.28 --> 3411.299
communication that's Wizardry right

3406.579 --> 3412.5
sorcery is more about drugs

3411.299 --> 3413.7599999999998
about

3412.5 --> 3416.52
like

3413.76 --> 3419.7000000000003
bizarre

3416.52 --> 3422.4
drug related spiritual experiences and

3419.7 --> 3425.16
like deep diving and in a way what I do

3422.4 --> 3428.599
too dream walking

3425.16 --> 3428.5989999999997
it is kind of sorcery

3435.72 --> 3441.14
hello surface day what kind of a way is

3438.599 --> 3441.1400000000003
that did

3444.78 --> 3449.7000000000003
rage win again no

3448.26 --> 3452.1600000000003
no

3449.7 --> 3454.799
it's just that all these stories about

3452.16 --> 3456.66
the past that are blatantly turned

3454.799 --> 3460.46
inside out not

3456.66 --> 3463.68
it's not even Rewritten it's literally

3460.46 --> 3465.0
180 degrees exactly the opposite of how

3463.68 --> 3467.7599999999998
it happened

3465.0 --> 3471.0
it's not a different story it's the

3467.76 --> 3476.059
story but turned 180 degrees inside out

3471.0 --> 3476.059
and that's what makes me pissed off

3476.52 --> 3481.079
I hate it when I I bump into that sort

3480.0 --> 3483.9
of things

3481.079 --> 3486.98
words are sorcery no

3483.9 --> 3486.98
words are information

3488.52 --> 3494.64
it's what the mind and the heart does

3491.88 --> 3497.28
with words that could be classified

3494.64 --> 3500.1189999999997
under sorcery or rather social

3497.28 --> 3500.119
manipulation

3524.88 --> 3531.1800000000003
try to manipulate gods that makes no

3528.059 --> 3534.799
sense Malachi 35 that literally there is

3531.18 --> 3534.799
no logic behind that statement

3534.96 --> 3540.359
you can't manipulate God you can't even

3537.299 --> 3542.94
try it it doesn't work

3540.359 --> 3544.68
you can only conceal God and that's what

3542.94 --> 3545.88
they did that's how they started it's

3544.68 --> 3550.46
the first

3545.88 --> 3550.46
first Horseman of the eclipse

3550.619 --> 3556.2000000000003
you take the the wisest of wise Jesus

3555.119 --> 3559.859
Christ

3556.2 --> 3562.9199999999996
information that was beyond what anybody

3559.859 --> 3567.42
could truly imagine at the time

3562.92 --> 3569.16
and then take that claim its power claim

3567.42 --> 3572.579
God hold on to it

3569.16 --> 3575.16
and then proceed to work your way around

3572.579 --> 3576.599
it with writings and talking a lot of

3575.16 --> 3580.859
talking people

3576.599 --> 3583.92
until everybody does exactly the

3580.859 --> 3586.7599999999998
opposite of what the person they worship

3583.92 --> 3586.76
is saying

3589.559 --> 3593.7000000000003
yeah

3590.7 --> 3597.1189999999997
to take everything in the wrong way to

3593.7 --> 3600.24
do everything as wrong as humanly

3597.119 --> 3603.6600000000003
possible without them even realizing

3600.24 --> 3605.4599999999996
that they are doing it wrong

3603.66 --> 3607.98
that's

3605.46 --> 3610.559
what the church did that's the first

3607.98 --> 3614.04
Horseman of the eclipse

3610.559 --> 3618.2400000000002
then they insert it

3614.04 --> 3618.24
yeah the the mathematicians

3618.78 --> 3623.88
and astrologers and they made astronomy

3621.599 --> 3627.3590000000004
and they made the fantasy science

3623.88 --> 3629.52
fiction realm in which Earth is a ball

3627.359 --> 3632.64
and they turn everything around and they

3629.52 --> 3635.7
turn all the natural law knowledge all

3632.64 --> 3637.92
the material knowledge inside out until

3635.7 --> 3641.04
it's all a giant mess

3637.92 --> 3643.319
and then they made that into what

3641.04 --> 3646.38
everybody should believe

3643.319 --> 3649.2599999999998
even though it also already contrasts it

3646.38 --> 3651.359
like it's already against

3649.26 --> 3655.1400000000003
the teachings of the Bible

3651.359 --> 3658.859
it is right but at that point the people

3655.14 --> 3660.9
were already so remote from what yeah

3658.859 --> 3663.72
all that wisdom and Jesus teachings

3660.9 --> 3667.02
actually was that they didn't even

3663.72 --> 3669.359
notice it anymore

3667.02 --> 3672.299
because eventually when the parrots

3669.359 --> 3675.359
don't warn you about it anymore

3672.299 --> 3678.599
you accept it the lie and then you teach

3675.359 --> 3679.44
your children that lie and then they

3678.599 --> 3684.38
never

3679.44 --> 3684.38
grew up knowing it was a lie

3696.78 --> 3699.3190000000004
right

3700.47 --> 3703.3799999999997
[Music]

3701.579 --> 3706.7400000000002
and then

3703.38 --> 3708.6600000000003
the 19th century happened

3706.74 --> 3712.799
and the third

3708.66 --> 3715.02
Horseman of the eclipse came in

3712.799 --> 3718.14
psychology

3715.02 --> 3719.66
psychology social engineering

3718.14 --> 3722.339
um

3719.66 --> 3724.0789999999997
how is the people think

3722.339 --> 3727.799
we're going to rearrange them and make

3724.079 --> 3729.78
them fully dependent on the state

3727.799 --> 3731.839
so that they will not count on those

3729.78 --> 3735.299
families anymore

3731.839 --> 3738.72
we will be their family and they will

3735.299 --> 3740.52
beg for us to take their possessions in

3738.72 --> 3743.0589999999997
order to protect them

3740.52 --> 3743.059
right

3743.52 --> 3750.839
and then the oligarchy

3747.24 --> 3754.2599999999998
the robber barons and the really

3750.839 --> 3757.799
freaking evil nobilities they bound

3754.26 --> 3760.6800000000003
together with the Vatican and proceeded

3757.799 --> 3762.859
to unleash all lead garbage onto the

3760.68 --> 3764.46
world all the mind control

3762.859 --> 3767.42
socialism

3764.46 --> 3767.42
communism

3767.64 --> 3770.64
corporatism

3771.0 --> 3775.44
the undead ruling corporatism that's

3773.4 --> 3777.599
what it is

3775.44 --> 3782.119
and that's the third

3777.599 --> 3782.119
that's the third Horseman of the eclipse

3806.52 --> 3808.7
foreign

3809.4 --> 3814.559
okay

3811.559 --> 3817.799
yeah well just go off to work then

3814.559 --> 3821.119
service day we don't nobody cares what

3817.799 --> 3821.119
happened a few days ago

3822.119 --> 3826.44
you're unbanned now

3824.52 --> 3830.119
but if you're still going to be like

3826.44 --> 3830.119
that I will just do it again

3830.94 --> 3834.26
it's not the first time

3852.72 --> 3857.52
no more oh oh well okay

3855.599 --> 3859.88
okay

3857.52 --> 3863.96
it's time to go then again again

3859.88 --> 3863.96
because you're still like this

3864.18 --> 3870.2599999999998
can't let it go then

3866.52 --> 3870.2599999999998
take a few days off

3874.14 --> 3880.8799999999997
or forever whatever you think you need

3877.859 --> 3884.339
if you need to let me go and go forever

3880.88 --> 3887.76
then go forever I don't give a [ __ ] at

3884.339 --> 3892.98
this point okay all I care about is that

3887.76 --> 3896.88
I will not tolerate lip in any form on

3892.98 --> 3899.96
any level from you do you understand

3896.88 --> 3899.96
do you understand

3908.96 --> 3917.28
you literally called me a liar

3913.38 --> 3921.119
and there's no oh yo you read it wrong

3917.28 --> 3924.42
no you literally said it in the chat to

3921.119 --> 3926.94
my face and it was completely insane and

3924.42 --> 3930.66
intolerable

3926.94 --> 3933.78
it's like a I assigned all this wisdom

3930.66 --> 3936.66
to you that you proved to me and then

3933.78 --> 3940.619
you do that and literally throw that

3936.66 --> 3943.98
wisdom down the [ __ ]

3940.619 --> 3945.839
it's absurd it's intolerable I will not

3943.98 --> 3950.28
tolerate it

3945.839 --> 3952.5589999999997
and until you recover and retain regain

3950.28 --> 3955.88
your senses you're not welcome here

3952.559 --> 3955.88
anymore service day

3973.619 --> 3977.96
what nephew Hall gross

3999.72 --> 4002.0789999999997
foreign

4029.0 --> 4034.22
oh oh yeah service day to prove my point

4032.0 --> 4037.119
literally nobody here in chat actually

4034.22 --> 4037.1189999999997
gives a [ __ ]

4037.7 --> 4044.24
see see how nobody is in Outrage

4041.66 --> 4046.64
oh nobody even like cares what I said

4044.24 --> 4047.66
about it that's how much they care they

4046.64 --> 4050.0589999999997
don't care

4047.66 --> 4050.96
because you were squirting you were

4050.059 --> 4053.299
wrong

4050.96 --> 4057.039
and now you're not backing down

4053.299 --> 4057.0389999999998
and this is not gonna work

4068.8 --> 4072.0190000000002
[Music]

4081.079 --> 4084.76
what are you guys talking about

4091.039 --> 4095.26
oh my God is that an actual baller

4095.78 --> 4102.14
that's hilarious

4098.54 --> 4104.98
Neil die you really think now this is

4102.14 --> 4104.9800000000005
just the sock guy

4111.319 --> 4119.0
makes us go down any idea what yeah yeah

4114.62 --> 4122.239
we do Neil died we all know

4119.0 --> 4123.38
we know what it actually does which is

4122.239 --> 4126.699
ignored

4123.38 --> 4126.6990000000005
by ball believers

4127.88 --> 4132.259
we do know what makes things go down and

4130.4 --> 4136.48
we also know what things make what makes

4132.259 --> 4136.48
things go up it's not gravity

4137.38 --> 4140.7390000000005
moon buggy

4158.56 --> 4162.759
okay yeah can a bear

4199.64 --> 4204.219
oh

4202.04 --> 4204.219
foreign

4204.28 --> 4209.739
I got a PayPal donation I didn't even

4207.38 --> 4209.7390000000005
notice

4210.199 --> 4213.219
from who is that

4213.38 --> 4217.84
it says weed money that's hilarious

4221.48 --> 4226.459999999999
the who in chat actually sent me that

4223.76 --> 4230.38
PayPal nobody gave me a notification or

4226.46 --> 4230.38
I was super distracted in the moment

4231.679 --> 4235.78
is that can a bear was that you

4236.48 --> 4240.98
makes sense since you're talking about

4238.46 --> 4244.719
getting high and all that

4240.98 --> 4244.718999999999
kind of bear was that your PayPal

4252.38 --> 4259.04
anyway thank you a lot thank you that's

4255.08 --> 4261.199
God you guys are saving my ass

4259.04 --> 4262.699
at the same time others are trying to

4261.199 --> 4266.32
attack me

4262.699 --> 4270.86
I don't even know why

4266.32 --> 4272.42
besides yeah I am loud and unrelenting

4270.86 --> 4274.46
yeah oh

4272.42 --> 4277.2390000000005
is that a really good reason

4274.46 --> 4277.2390000000005
to go there

4277.34 --> 4281.42
yeah thank you Canada I really

4279.32 --> 4283.94
appreciate because I really knew it I

4281.42 --> 4286.52
know it needed it's like 50 euros right

4283.94 --> 4288.739
now and still got like three more weeks

4286.52 --> 4290.84
to go

4288.739 --> 4292.699
so yeah I need the support thank you

4290.84 --> 4294.9800000000005
very much thank you very much for

4292.699 --> 4297.379999999999
keeping me going

4294.98 --> 4301.218999999999
I'm definitely gonna spend it on food

4297.38 --> 4302.3
though I got some weed it just

4301.219 --> 4304.46
yeah

4302.3 --> 4305.719
I need to go slow and all that it's too

4304.46 --> 4310.04
expensive

4305.719 --> 4313.4
and by the way there's been inflation

4310.04 --> 4316.4
unfortunately like I've noticed that

4313.4 --> 4319.179
that since the beginning this year like

4316.4 --> 4323.96
certain food items in the supermarket

4319.179 --> 4326.3
they've grown like 20 more expensive

4323.96 --> 4329.4800000000005
it's pretty devastating it doesn't seem

4326.3 --> 4331.58
to be all products but definitely a

4329.48 --> 4334.639999999999
couple

4331.58 --> 4337.04
so yeah I've heard it that that's going

4334.64 --> 4339.38
around in other countries too but it's

4337.04 --> 4342.58
also here in the Netherlands not very

4339.38 --> 4342.58
super happy about that

4349.699 --> 4354.86
oh my God slo-mo moon buggy really

4352.04 --> 4357.86
Brenda talked about total solipsistic

4354.86 --> 4360.099999999999
reversal what it is to be a brain in a

4357.86 --> 4360.099999999999
jar

4380.36 --> 4384.92
I didn't know that Brenda was even still

4382.699 --> 4388.339999999999
doing stuff out there

4384.92 --> 4392.9
I mean you'd think that like

4388.34 --> 4395.06
the the Jabs would eventually get her

4392.9 --> 4398.96
because you know she's gonna do that

4395.06 --> 4403.580000000001
right there's no choice person like that

4398.96 --> 4406.219
like you know she can't turn against

4403.58 --> 4410.0599999999995
any of that

4406.219 --> 4412.58
or maybe she just secretly knows and

4410.06 --> 4415.400000000001
it's just like oh yeah I'm gonna spread

4412.58 --> 4418.34
it like an evil communist

4415.4 --> 4420.799999999999
which he kind of is

4418.34 --> 4424.6
not even kind of she is pretty much

4420.8 --> 4424.6
blatantly a communist

4426.8 --> 4432.1
the bad time

4429.56 --> 4432.1
anyway

4433.04 --> 4436.78
but apparently she's still around

4444.32 --> 4448.34
he's talking about water not being real

4446.719 --> 4450.5
what

4448.34 --> 4453.88
oh

4450.5 --> 4453.88
what does that even mean

4457.4 --> 4460.12
what

4471.38 --> 4478.179
oh Neil die okay let me let me bump in

4475.88 --> 4478.179
there

4478.76 --> 4482.62
tell you about gas behavior right well

4481.159 --> 4485.78
guess

4482.62 --> 4488.179
expands in all directions to Avail the

4485.78 --> 4490.9
fill the available volume that's what

4488.179 --> 4490.9
gases do

4491.0 --> 4497.06
once they've filled the available volume

4494.54 --> 4499.96
then secondary effects might happen

4497.06 --> 4502.6990000000005
right there's different temperature

4499.96 --> 4506.0
inserts different sides of the available

4502.699 --> 4508.46
volume of the container then a gradient

4506.0 --> 4511.46
for example might form

4508.46 --> 4515.06
right another element of gas behavior is

4511.46 --> 4518.0
if you have two different types of gases

4515.06 --> 4519.1990000000005
that are of a very different type of

4518.0 --> 4521.9
density

4519.199 --> 4523.839999999999
and you put them together then at first

4521.9 --> 4527.0599999999995
they will seek

4523.84 --> 4529.58
their this equilibrium or they will seek

4527.06 --> 4530.6
their equilibrium in relation to the

4529.58 --> 4533.54
rest

4530.6 --> 4535.34
so the denser gas will kind of expand

4533.54 --> 4538.82
downward

4535.34 --> 4542.42
sort of seem to separate from the less

4538.82 --> 4545.0
dense gas that will float on top but

4542.42 --> 4549.4400000000005
eventually it will mix in

4545.0 --> 4552.14
into it in homogeneous mesh and then you

4549.44 --> 4553.879999999999
yeah you can't separate it anymore

4552.14 --> 4555.8
oh yeah well you have to like

4553.88 --> 4556.82
industrially separate you could separate

4555.8 --> 4559.159000000001
it but

4556.82 --> 4563.0
you can't just like separate take a

4559.159 --> 4565.219
scoop from one side and be it have it be

4563.0 --> 4567.08
one gas and then the scoop from the

4565.219 --> 4569.06
other side and have it be another that's

4567.08 --> 4572.54
not gonna work then anymore that only

4569.06 --> 4575.120000000001
works upon first insertion

4572.54 --> 4578.659
because gas yeah it expands in all

4575.12 --> 4583.159
directions it mixes in with other gas

4578.659 --> 4586.759999999999
but as long as it's still homogeneous

4583.159 --> 4589.46
one type then it may still be subjected

4586.76 --> 4592.1
to relative density in a direct sense

4589.46 --> 4594.199
in relation to the rest of the gas which

4592.1 --> 4598.58
could be considered the medium

4594.199 --> 4602.379999999999
in which that particular glob globule of

4598.58 --> 4602.38
gas is being inserted

4605.659 --> 4610.58
pressure Behavior relief from

4607.4 --> 4613.94
atmospheric pressure no

4610.58 --> 4616.94
now an atmosphere is an oxymoron

4613.94 --> 4619.94
there's no sphere-shaped error but the

4616.94 --> 4622.46
gas in the realm popularly called

4619.94 --> 4624.199
atmosphere which is technically

4622.46 --> 4627.38
incorrect

4624.199 --> 4629.799999999999
no it is gas it's all gas there's only

4627.38 --> 4629.8
gas

4650.239 --> 4655.699
yeah I don't know Matthew Hall I think

4652.88 --> 4659.0
that Brenda might just be sinking deeper

4655.699 --> 4662.12
into complete nonsense

4659.0 --> 4664.219
you know she's already accepting being a

4662.12 --> 4667.84
brain in a in a jar

4664.219 --> 4671.96
as her reality then yeah why not like

4667.84 --> 4673.9400000000005
water doesn't exist why not I mean why

4671.96 --> 4676.88
not at that point right

4673.94 --> 4679.58
If a shoe can be a phenomenon

4676.88 --> 4683.42
or the bending of space-time is the hole

4679.58 --> 4686.5
in the donut then why not have water

4683.42 --> 4686.5
just not exist

4687.86 --> 4693.58
and a clock is a dog bone you know the

4690.98 --> 4693.58
routines

4709.219 --> 4715.159
and the vacuum his face is not next to

4711.8 --> 4717.820000000001
the atmosphere the very sparse layer of

4715.159 --> 4717.82
the gradient

4717.92 --> 4721.6990000000005
yeah yeah but that's not how gradients

4720.08 --> 4723.32
work though

4721.699 --> 4726.98
you know

4723.32 --> 4730.82
the funny thing about gradation is it

4726.98 --> 4733.159
always applies to the entire volume

4730.82 --> 4736.699
right a gradient

4733.159 --> 4741.219
the way it manifests is always in

4736.699 --> 4745.5199999999995
relation specifically directly tied into

4741.219 --> 4748.46
relation of the total volume available

4745.52 --> 4750.1990000000005
a gradient is never going to be oh it's

4748.46 --> 4754.04
it's a gradient right here look at oh

4750.199 --> 4755.139999999999
gradients and then a giant block of no

4754.04 --> 4758.14
gradient

4755.14 --> 4761.900000000001
or extremely low

4758.14 --> 4765.02
that never ever happens under any

4761.9 --> 4766.159
circumstances gas never gradiates like

4765.02 --> 4769.400000000001
that

4766.159 --> 4772.219
it cannot not even with the most absurd

4769.4 --> 4774.259999999999
extreme temperature differences

4772.219 --> 4776.42
it will not do that

4774.26 --> 4780.08
always gradient it out

4776.42 --> 4781.58
a relatively linear pattern

4780.08 --> 4785.719
look at the

4781.58 --> 4789.14
like one of those typical 45 degree line

4785.719 --> 4791.6
types of types of statistics

4789.14 --> 4794.12
right that's how it will gradient out

4791.6 --> 4797.719
from one side of the container to the

4794.12 --> 4800.239
other it's not going to be oh look

4797.719 --> 4802.4
there's this giant super thick layer and

4800.239 --> 4804.139999999999
then all slightly above it it's half

4802.4 --> 4808.04
that and all slightly above half that

4804.14 --> 4811.159000000001
and and then you have all this space

4808.04 --> 4814.28
with almost absolutely nothing compared

4811.159 --> 4817.54
to that first layer that's not our gas

4814.28 --> 4820.96
pressure system gradates it can never

4817.54 --> 4820.96
gradiate like that

4821.78 --> 4825.94
it can doesn't do that

4826.76 --> 4833.06
like it doesn't matter even if you have

4828.92 --> 4834.9800000000005
like perfect zero Kelvin temperature on

4833.06 --> 4838.639
one side of the container

4834.98 --> 4840.739
and like this insane

4838.639 --> 4843.38
hundreds or thousands of degrees

4840.739 --> 4845.0599999999995
temperature on the other side which is

4843.38 --> 4846.8
kind of like gonna destabilize the

4845.06 --> 4849.5
tanker

4846.8 --> 4851.900000000001
it's gonna destabilize the

4849.5 --> 4854.54
the container right but

4851.9 --> 4857.54
theoretically like it's not going to

4854.54 --> 4859.94
cause that sort of gradient it doesn't

4857.54 --> 4862.28
work like that it can never work like

4859.94 --> 4866.0
that there is no demonstration in

4862.28 --> 4869.659
physical reality in recorded history

4866.0 --> 4872.42
like all of it where that happens a gas

4869.659 --> 4875.239
pressure gradient is never divided like

4872.42 --> 4879.1990000000005
that the pattern is distinct

4875.239 --> 4881.32
gradient is always relatively linear

4879.199 --> 4884.659
and directly

4881.32 --> 4887.259999999999
dependent on the volume of the available

4884.659 --> 4887.259999999999
space

4887.659 --> 4894.138999999999
so if you

4890.48 --> 4897.199
then get theoretical about it conceptual

4894.139 --> 4899.92
and say oh but outer space

4897.199 --> 4902.599999999999
how large is it is it's

4899.92 --> 4904.159
unfathomably large and well there could

4902.6 --> 4906.02
be your gradient

4904.159 --> 4910.42
well then you're gonna have to make

4906.02 --> 4914.120000000001
stretch up that gradiation to the

4910.42 --> 4916.34
unfathomably large astronomical sized

4914.12 --> 4919.34
folio

4916.34 --> 4921.5
and it isn't that's not how this

4919.34 --> 4925.46
gradient exists here

4921.5 --> 4927.5
if it would be with an open system then

4925.46 --> 4930.94
there would be no outer space there

4927.5 --> 4934.699
would be outer gas because the entire

4930.94 --> 4937.78
astronomically huge sized Universe would

4934.699 --> 4937.78
be filled with gas

4937.82 --> 4942.38
it's the only way

4940.159 --> 4944.78
you could have a gradient in an open

4942.38 --> 4947.06
system with a super huge Outer Space

4944.78 --> 4950.0599999999995
Universe and brings in all kinds of

4947.06 --> 4953.84
other problems of course but that's just

4950.06 --> 4957.5
considering the gas pressure situation

4953.84 --> 4961.28
the gradient cannot gradiate out into

4957.5 --> 4964.34
Infinite volume and then be this thick

4961.28 --> 4965.96
for such a little part on the earth in

4964.34 --> 4967.9400000000005
an open system that's physically

4965.96 --> 4970.88
impossible it doesn't matter how you

4967.94 --> 4974.659
approach this there is no conceivable

4970.88 --> 4976.52
demonstration that can show you what you

4974.659 --> 4978.799999999999
require

4976.52 --> 4981.860000000001
right what you require for what is

4978.8 --> 4983.360000000001
assumed in the globe model about gas

4981.86 --> 4986.12
pressure on Earth

4983.36 --> 4988.88
there is no demonstration you couldn't

4986.12 --> 4994.04
conceive of that is in the physical real

4988.88 --> 4996.32
world that can show a gas gradiating out

4994.04 --> 4998.0
in the way that is required in order to

4996.32 --> 4999.5599999999995
accept that there is gas pressure on a

4998.0 --> 5001.719
ball in the giant outer space with an

4999.56 --> 5004.719
open system

5001.719 --> 5006.46
you can't do it it doesn't exist it will

5004.719 --> 5008.04
never exist

5006.46 --> 5012.04
it is

5008.04 --> 5012.04
mathematically impossible

5020.679 --> 5024.54
so I hope that clears things up

5039.159 --> 5044.259999999999
to take your finger in in fact I can't

5041.86 --> 5046.839999999999
yeah for everybody reading the chat

5044.26 --> 5049.56
don't actually stick your finger in a

5046.84 --> 5049.56
vacuum chamber

5049.6 --> 5052.56
dangerous

5052.78 --> 5058.0599999999995
don't actually do that can be very

5055.6 --> 5061.139
painful and yeah

5058.06 --> 5061.139
just don't do that

5068.26 --> 5074.1
like vacuum is is actually quite

5071.62 --> 5074.099999999999
dangerous

5088.84 --> 5094.26
yeah a gradient where gravity is weaker

5091.42 --> 5097.84
well yeah kind of bear even through the

5094.26 --> 5100.4800000000005
heliocentric modeling and assuming that

5097.84 --> 5103.719
gravity is supposedly attracts that gas

5100.48 --> 5106.599999999999
and sticks it to the ball even in that

5103.719 --> 5109.2390000000005
system it just doesn't work

5106.6 --> 5112.0
because gravity is not as you said it's

5109.239 --> 5114.36
not strong enough it's considered by

5112.0 --> 5117.1
those who do take it into consideration

5114.36 --> 5119.62
gravity is considered the weakest Force

5117.1 --> 5122.8
it's not even weak it's the weakest

5119.62 --> 5125.38
Force it's so weak it's almost like

5122.8 --> 5127.2390000000005
could just be discarded oh because it

5125.38 --> 5130.12
can because it doesn't actually exist

5127.239 --> 5133.659
and nobody needs it

5130.12 --> 5135.96
it's only heliocentris needs it to try

5133.659 --> 5140.638999999999
to justify things that are physically

5135.96 --> 5140.639
ridiculous and absolutely impossible

5140.679 --> 5143.219
right

5143.92 --> 5149.1990000000005
because

5145.06 --> 5150.34
how is this supposed pull over a

5149.199 --> 5154.0
distance

5150.34 --> 5156.400000000001
going to keep gas from escaping it isn't

5154.0 --> 5157.96
only containment can do that

5156.4 --> 5160.839999999999
because gas

5157.96 --> 5162.3
is not something that that has drag you

5160.84 --> 5166.0
can't just

5162.3 --> 5169.12
grab hold of the gas and then pull it

5166.0 --> 5172.06
right that only works if there's actual

5169.12 --> 5174.04
solid things that contain the gas like a

5172.06 --> 5175.06
balloon then you can grab all of it and

5174.04 --> 5176.44
pull it

5175.06 --> 5180.1
right

5176.44 --> 5182.678999999999
so how is this supposed gravity pull

5180.1 --> 5185.02
over distance Gunk to even keep the gas

5182.679 --> 5186.34
to the ball it's not even theoretically

5185.02 --> 5190.0
possible

5186.34 --> 5194.5
right and all of these mechanical flaws

5190.0 --> 5196.719
come meet if let me

5194.5 --> 5199.36
to make the statement that the globe

5196.719 --> 5203.02
model and all its physics is the most

5199.36 --> 5205.9
fallacious conceptual model Humanity has

5203.02 --> 5208.42
ever created and probably will ever be

5205.9 --> 5211.36
able to create nothing is more

5208.42 --> 5214.96
fallacious than the globe model it is

5211.36 --> 5217.299999999999
the most erroneous thing Humanity has

5214.96 --> 5220.42
ever produced because it's wrong in

5217.3 --> 5222.6
absolutely everything conceivable pretty

5220.42 --> 5222.6
much

5223.0 --> 5228.82
it is the Reversed world it is absolute

5225.76 --> 5230.4400000000005
lies in every every little corner about

5228.82 --> 5234.04
it

5230.44 --> 5237.699
it is the devil's cosmology

5234.04 --> 5240.82
it is directly in opposition to physical

5237.699 --> 5244.54
reality which is designed by a Creator

5240.82 --> 5247.259999999999
God the designer and the origin of all

5244.54 --> 5251.679
information and the globe birth

5247.26 --> 5254.08
is a giant lie it's everything turned

5251.679 --> 5257.4400000000005
inside out every understanding about

5254.08 --> 5261.219
physical reality is turn inside out in

5257.44 --> 5264.638999999999
order to make it seemingly work to the

5261.219 --> 5267.46
mind of a to a dilapidated Mind of a

5264.639 --> 5269.8
person that doesn't know any better

5267.46 --> 5273.88
a globe Fundy

5269.8 --> 5276.9400000000005
but it is the most fallacious thing

5273.88 --> 5280.2390000000005
Humanity has ever produced

5276.94 --> 5282.219
and Humanity has produced quite a bunch

5280.239 --> 5286.718999999999
of fallacious ideas

5282.219 --> 5290.56
but this one is is literally

5286.719 --> 5293.199
the ice the icing on the cake it is the

5290.56 --> 5296.4400000000005
worst that's everything about it is

5293.199 --> 5299.739
wrong from every angle it's like the

5296.44 --> 5301.9
globe model is almost so fallacious that

5299.739 --> 5304.299999999999
it Prides itself

5301.9 --> 5306.94
that it is the most fallacious because

5304.3 --> 5310.12
at least it's the best at something it's

5306.94 --> 5312.28
the best at being the worst

5310.12 --> 5315.96
and what can be more satanic than that

5312.28 --> 5315.96
the best at being the worst

5316.54 --> 5319.08
right

5335.76 --> 5340.3
gravity particles gravity waves oh

5338.56 --> 5342.580000000001
there's a ripple of gravity coming

5340.3 --> 5345.639
quickly

5342.58 --> 5348.219
get ready to have your space time bent

5345.639 --> 5353.9800000000005
there's a ripple of gravity coming it's

5348.219 --> 5357.52
a gravity tsunami oh the space and time

5353.98 --> 5362.28
is bending oh oh I feel the Ripple of

5357.52 --> 5362.280000000001
gravity going through me oh no

5369.94 --> 5375.099999999999
it's

5371.4 --> 5378.04
ridiculous it's funny though it's funny

5375.1 --> 5379.42
how ridiculous it is right anyway gonna

5378.04 --> 5381.6
take a two minute break I'll be right

5379.42 --> 5381.6
back

5432.76 --> 5434.9400000000005
thank you

5460.06 --> 5463.06
yo

5478.3 --> 5481.96
all you have to do is have a religious

5480.82 --> 5485.92
belief

5481.96 --> 5489.04
and intentionally misunderstand science

5485.92 --> 5491.9800000000005
well yeah that's that's what being a

5489.04 --> 5493.239
globe Fundy or an anti-flatter is all

5491.98 --> 5496.239
about

5493.239 --> 5496.239
pl01

5506.86 --> 5512.58
oh my God

5509.44 --> 5512.58
he's a dumbass

5513.78 --> 5520.12
plo001 what that's not even a name dude

5516.82 --> 5522.28
are you even trying

5520.12 --> 5524.86
oh speaking about my little rant there

5522.28 --> 5528.0599999999995
Oh you mean the truth

5524.86 --> 5533.44
the absolute provable

5528.06 --> 5538.54
physically mathematically provable truth

5533.44 --> 5540.82
that which is absolutely true

5538.54 --> 5542.92
yeah concerning gas pressure and

5540.82 --> 5545.199
gradients and how gravity doesn't

5542.92 --> 5547.06
actually

5545.199 --> 5550.0
do anything

5547.06 --> 5551.620000000001
like it can't do anything like even if

5550.0 --> 5555.04
you thought it was real it couldn't even

5551.62 --> 5559.179
do what it was designated to do

5555.04 --> 5562.8
that part yeah yeah that's the truth

5559.179 --> 5562.8
provably truth

5563.139 --> 5567.58
nonsense about gradients oh really

5566.139 --> 5570.88
nonsense

5567.58 --> 5575.08
so hey hey BL 0-1

5570.88 --> 5576.54
why don't you give your little version

5575.08 --> 5578.5599999999995
why why

5576.54 --> 5580.96
there's gas

5578.56 --> 5581.92
pressure yeah pretty high and pretty

5580.96 --> 5584.8
thick

5581.92 --> 5588.219
right here on the surface of Earth that

5584.8 --> 5590.34
you think is a ball in an open system to

5588.219 --> 5593.199
outer space which is

5590.34 --> 5595.0
larger than any person could imagine

5593.199 --> 5599.919999999999
yeah

5595.0 --> 5601.179
so how do you explain how that gas is

5599.92 --> 5604.3
divided

5601.179 --> 5606.04
the way it is and it's super thick Air

5604.3 --> 5608.860000000001
at the Earth's surface

5606.04 --> 5611.8
but then it quickly decreases in

5608.86 --> 5614.199
thickness yet stays in its place it

5611.8 --> 5616.4800000000005
doesn't rush out right which normally

5614.199 --> 5619.44
would happen

5616.48 --> 5622.599999999999
and then it just kind of like stops

5619.44 --> 5625.0
stops it becomes so thin and then it

5622.6 --> 5626.9400000000005
just stays thin for

5625.0 --> 5629.159
what is it

5626.94 --> 5632.199
99.999999999

5629.159 --> 5635.5599999999995
of the rest of the volume

5632.199 --> 5640.48
so what is your model for that how do

5635.56 --> 5640.4800000000005
you explain that then pl01

5642.4 --> 5646.719
in the shadow of everything that I

5644.44 --> 5648.638999999999
talked about or you just don't have an

5646.719 --> 5651.34
explanation

5648.639 --> 5653.9400000000005
calling it ad hoc

5651.34 --> 5653.9400000000005
garbage

5660.58 --> 5664.42
or are you just gonna have a

5662.44 --> 5666.4
conversation with somebody else now now

5664.42 --> 5667.96
that I've actually picked up on what you

5666.4 --> 5670.799999999999
were talking about

5667.96 --> 5670.8
all right yeah

5674.32 --> 5682.44
we already have different it's fresher

5677.56 --> 5682.4400000000005
oh my God this guy doesn't even

5683.58 --> 5687.54
why is it always that

5688.54 --> 5691.619
oh my God

5693.219 --> 5697.26
our people so stupid

5697.719 --> 5701.28
people's so stupid

5706.3 --> 5709.3
foreign

5713.8 --> 5720.639
gas pressure expands in all directions

5716.92 --> 5724.96
to fill the available volume

5720.639 --> 5728.9800000000005
it is not held down with weight it

5724.96 --> 5732.42
expands to a fill the available volume

5728.98 --> 5735.94
of the container

5732.42 --> 5739.0
weight is irrelevant

5735.94 --> 5742.0599999999995
it can't do anything it's still going to

5739.0 --> 5744.46
expand in all directions now once it is

5742.06 --> 5747.400000000001
filled the available volume yeah it can

5744.46 --> 5749.7390000000005
have weight you can calculate the rise

5747.4 --> 5750.879999999999
the convention of weight that oh there's

5749.739 --> 5753.5199999999995
a weight

5750.88 --> 5754.900000000001
cool it's still going to expand in all

5753.52 --> 5757.119000000001
directions though

5754.9 --> 5760.179
why do you have to actually counter that

5757.119 --> 5762.58
right weight doesn't counter gas

5760.179 --> 5765.219
expanding in all directions to fill the

5762.58 --> 5767.46
available volume it's still gonna do

5765.219 --> 5767.46
that

5769.06 --> 5772.06
foreign

5781.38 --> 5787.6
tell me what an air pressure is at 120

5785.199 --> 5790.96
foot yeah it's less you know why it's

5787.6 --> 5793.96
less because of the limited size of the

5790.96 --> 5797.56
container which allows gradation

5793.96 --> 5801.78
formation specifically attuned to that

5797.56 --> 5806.02
size if the container size was a hundred

5801.78 --> 5809.8
quadrillion times larger or more which

5806.02 --> 5812.92
is the model claim for heliocentrism it

5809.8 --> 5816.159000000001
wouldn't gradiate out like that the

5812.92 --> 5819.4
gradient would be much more spread out

5816.159 --> 5823.44
over the available volume for the gas to

5819.4 --> 5823.44
fill you freaking numpty

5825.3 --> 5829.4400000000005
that's what I've been saying

5830.18 --> 5834.209000000001
[Music]

5834.88 --> 5842.26
it doesn't matter it's 0.1 PSI

5838.9 --> 5844.599999999999
it's 0.1 PSI because of the limited

5842.26 --> 5847.0
volume of the container

5844.6 --> 5849.6990000000005
are you not hearing what I'm saying it's

5847.0 --> 5853.42
the limited volume of the container it's

5849.699 --> 5856.0599999999995
the limited volume of the container that

5853.42 --> 5858.82
allows the gradient to manifest like

5856.06 --> 5861.6990000000005
that if it was a hundred quadrillion

5858.82 --> 5864.219
times larger the gradient wouldn't

5861.699 --> 5868.78
gradiate out like that

5864.219 --> 5869.8
it would not be only one tenth at that

5868.78 --> 5871.84
height

5869.8 --> 5874.119000000001
it you would barely notice a difference

5871.84 --> 5877.54
because the container is a hundred

5874.119 --> 5879.88
quadrillion times larger so the gradient

5877.54 --> 5882.76
is going to spread out more you're not

5879.88 --> 5885.179
gonna have that measurable distinct

5882.76 --> 5889.3
difference over that small distance

5885.179 --> 5892.719
which we do which is a direct proof that

5889.3 --> 5894.76
the container is not that large it has a

5892.719 --> 5897.28
limited size and that's why we are

5894.76 --> 5899.38
actually able to measure the gas

5897.28 --> 5901.42
pressure gradient within it because if

5899.38 --> 5903.04
it was a hundred quadrillion times

5901.42 --> 5905.88
larger

5903.04 --> 5909.699
the gradient would also be a hundred

5905.88 --> 5912.159000000001
quadrillion times larger we would not be

5909.699 --> 5913.96
able to measure it here on Earth we

5912.159 --> 5916.179
wouldn't even know there was such a

5913.96 --> 5919.179
thing as a gradient we just think that

5916.179 --> 5921.219
everything would be the same pressure

5919.179 --> 5924.58
that's the reality

5921.219 --> 5927.639
yeah but since there is a gradient and

5924.58 --> 5931.6
we can measure it here on Earth

5927.639 --> 5933.9400000000005
being tiny little humans yeah since we

5931.6 --> 5937.06
can measure it that means that the

5933.94 --> 5938.799999999999
available volume for all that gas that's

5937.06 --> 5942.400000000001
here is right here you're breathing it

5938.8 --> 5947.46
and as a gradient it means the volume is

5942.4 --> 5950.86
not that big it's not Universe size big

5947.46 --> 5952.719
it's Earth realm size big however big

5950.86 --> 5955.659
that is I don't know exactly how big it

5952.719 --> 5958.2390000000005
is but it's small enough in order for us

5955.659 --> 5960.638999999999
to be able to measure the gas pressure

5958.239 --> 5963.9
gradient that is within it

5960.639 --> 5963.900000000001
and that's a fact

5964.3 --> 5969.820000000001
yes gas gradient yeah it's an expected

5967.84 --> 5971.38
side effect of gas expanding in all

5969.82 --> 5975.159
directions and the container laughing

5971.38 --> 5978.159000000001
Smiley yes it is you stupid [ __ ] yes

5975.159 --> 5980.5
it is it's the secondary thing that

5978.159 --> 5983.08
happens first the gas fills the

5980.5 --> 5986.02
available volume then a gradient might

5983.08 --> 5992.04
set in once it has filled the available

5986.02 --> 5992.040000000001
volume yes you stupid numpty [ __ ]

5992.49 --> 6000.54
[Music]

6002.76 --> 6007.159000000001
God

6004.139 --> 6007.159000000001
it's never gonna end

6015.06 --> 6019.679
I got them squirting triggering all over

6017.46 --> 6022.8
the place well they should be triggered

6019.679 --> 6025.139
because you are a [ __ ] [ __ ] and a

6022.8 --> 6028.139
Satan slave you believe in the dumbest

6025.139 --> 6030.659000000001
[ __ ] thing that the human mind has

6028.139 --> 6034.679
ever been subjected to and you believe

6030.659 --> 6038.28
it like a Satan [ __ ] guzzling piece of

6034.679 --> 6042.659
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] you're Satan's

6038.28 --> 6046.0199999999995

6042.659 --> 6049.0199999999995
stupid [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] you believe

6046.02 --> 6051.540000000001
the dumbest [ __ ] thing Humanity's

6049.02 --> 6056.040000000001
ever thought of in the universe you

6051.54 --> 6057.6
stupid [ __ ] you stupid [ __ ] Globe

6056.04 --> 6060.679
[ __ ]

6057.6 --> 6063.84
you believe the dumbest [ __ ] thing

6060.679 --> 6066.3
Humanity's ever conjured up and you

6063.84 --> 6071.4800000000005
believe it right now you're guzzling it

6066.3 --> 6071.4800000000005
down like a [ __ ] Satan slave [ __ ]

6077.34 --> 6084.659000000001
oh

6079.739 --> 6088.5599999999995
yeah wow wow indeed you [ __ ] [ __ ]

6084.659 --> 6091.08
you're the dumbest person all of you all

6088.56 --> 6094.1990000000005
of you anti-flatter [ __ ] you're the

6091.08 --> 6098.159
dumbest [ __ ] people the world's ever

6094.199 --> 6101.5199999999995
seen the world has ever seen you're so

6098.159 --> 6104.099999999999
[ __ ] dumb you literally suck Satan's

6101.52 --> 6107.280000000001
[ __ ] with your retardation you believe

6104.1 --> 6111.06
the dumbest [ __ ] thing Humanity's

6107.28 --> 6111.0599999999995
ever created ever

6111.48 --> 6119.4
that's how stupid you are globers

6116.239 --> 6122.699
numpty [ __ ]

6119.4 --> 6123.96
yeah even you Stone monkey you're that

6122.699 --> 6125.759999999999
stupid

6123.96 --> 6128.2390000000005
you're just a little bit more modest

6125.76 --> 6128.2390000000005
about it

6128.34 --> 6131.6990000000005
yeah

6129.42 --> 6134.82
so is bowin

6131.699 --> 6140.78
cause I don't believe it I just know how

6134.82 --> 6140.78
it works [ __ ] I know how it works

6151.8 --> 6157.58
I can't believe you're that [ __ ]

6153.96 --> 6157.58
stupid at this point

6158.4 --> 6166.799999999999
you people are so [ __ ] dumb I just

6162.36 --> 6170.219
nothing good will come of you nothing

6166.8 --> 6174.1990000000005
you are the new Sodom and Gomorrah

6170.219 --> 6174.199
people you're that [ __ ] stupid

6175.5 --> 6179.36
you're literally that stupid

6179.82 --> 6184.08
Sodom and Gomorrah stupid guess what

6182.34 --> 6187.4400000000005
happened to them yeah it's gonna happen

6184.08 --> 6190.76
to you too you [ __ ] retards you're

6187.44 --> 6190.759999999999
that [ __ ] stupid

6195.0 --> 6198.0
God

6213.659 --> 6219.138999999999
right

6215.34 --> 6219.139
I think I'm gonna round out the show now

6226.02 --> 6229.9400000000005
got the baller squirting for sure

6230.3 --> 6236.28
hey good servant thank you got a little

6233.88 --> 6239.28
Super Chat donation from you a little

6236.28 --> 6242.4
PayPal weed money from you really is

6239.28 --> 6244.5599999999995
that's hilarious thank you very much for

6242.4 --> 6247.159
the four bucks

6244.56 --> 6247.159000000001
ah

6247.199 --> 6253.619
that was good

6249.719 --> 6255.78
yeah sorry guys or well not sorry you

6253.619 --> 6260.719
guys probably love that I do this but

6255.78 --> 6260.719
yeah it's just that at some point

6260.94 --> 6267.599999999999
being as well being as good as I am in

6264.9 --> 6269.699
trying to explain exactly what's wrong

6267.6 --> 6271.860000000001
with the situation

6269.699 --> 6275.638999999999
it just gets

6271.86 --> 6278.82
I just am like let's just kill these

6275.639 --> 6281.46
guys let's just kill them off

6278.82 --> 6283.92
will probably be better for it

6281.46 --> 6286.199
I know it's probably won't work out like

6283.92 --> 6288.32
that but it's just a get they wound me

6286.199 --> 6292.199
up so much it's just at

6288.32 --> 6294.0
how much detail do I have to provide to

6292.199 --> 6297.299999999999
prove that what they believe is

6294.0 --> 6301.199
absolutely impossible no matter what

6297.3 --> 6303.54
happens ever ever in eternity it can

6301.199 --> 6307.259999999999
never happen it can never even happen in

6303.54 --> 6311.04
heaven yeah I'm taking that away

6307.26 --> 6313.619000000001
God cannot make the earth into a ball

6311.04 --> 6316.32
he cannot do it he cannot do it in

6313.619 --> 6319.799999999999
another dimension you cannot do it in

6316.32 --> 6323.58
heaven because it cannot be a ball the

6319.8 --> 6326.88
ball Earth is Satan's invention it is

6323.58 --> 6330.659
the most fallacious concept that has

6326.88 --> 6335.159000000001
ever been created ever and it was meant

6330.659 --> 6338.42
to be that it was meant to be wrong and

6335.159 --> 6343.08
it was meant for you not to be able to

6338.42 --> 6347.9400000000005
handle how wrong it is and then become a

6343.08 --> 6351.3
slave to it a slave to its fallacy and

6347.94 --> 6352.159
your inability to recognize it for what

6351.3 --> 6357.26
it is

6352.159 --> 6361.199
the LIE the ultimate lie of everything

6357.26 --> 6364.4400000000005
you can't handle the truth it's designed

6361.199 --> 6367.739
to be so fallacious that you can't

6364.44 --> 6371.638999999999
handle it and you will make the ball

6367.739 --> 6372.799999999999
your slave master for the rest of be our

6371.639 --> 6375.7390000000005
life

6372.8 --> 6379.02
escaping its fallacies

6375.739 --> 6382.0199999999995
defending it like Stockholm syndrome

6379.02 --> 6382.02
[ __ ]

6391.66 --> 6394.72
[Music]

6395.4 --> 6398.94
right

6396.96 --> 6402.619
but I am gonna round out before I'm

6398.94 --> 6402.619
gonna make myself lose my voice

6403.38 --> 6406.1
anyway

6406.82 --> 6411.299999999999
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

6409.44 --> 6413.4
like this show if you did then please

6411.3 --> 6416.219
don't forget the rogans it up and if you

6413.4 --> 6418.619
didn't then go [ __ ] yourself

6416.219 --> 6420.36
you can't handle the truth well then go

6418.619 --> 6423.239
[ __ ] yourself

6420.36 --> 6425.82
do whatever the [ __ ] you like go away go

6423.239 --> 6428.159
make anti-flatter Troll videos like a

6425.82 --> 6430.92
[ __ ] scumbag I don't give a [ __ ]

6428.159 --> 6432.599999999999
spread rumors about me do whatever you

6430.92 --> 6435.4800000000005
like

6432.6 --> 6438.659000000001
right do whatever you like I'm gonna say

6435.48 --> 6442.619
it exactly how I see it and how I feel

6438.659 --> 6444.599999999999
it yeah that too exactly exactly how I

6442.619 --> 6447.659
feel it and how I see it and there's

6444.6 --> 6450.780000000001
nothing you can do to stop me

6447.659 --> 6452.759999999999
if anybody could have stopped me they

6450.78 --> 6454.199
would have already

6452.76 --> 6457.08
they would have

6454.199 --> 6458.879999999999
nobody has I'm still doing it and I'm

6457.08 --> 6461.699
still doing it the way that I do it

6458.88 --> 6463.679
there's nothing that you can do about it

6461.699 --> 6466.099999999999
nothing

6463.679 --> 6466.1
right

6466.739 --> 6472.879999999999
you can help me out though

6469.32 --> 6476.5199999999995
and actually make it even more

6472.88 --> 6478.5
lasting make me keep going longer right

6476.52 --> 6481.56
doing that

6478.5 --> 6484.32
would guarantee that I would make a lot

6481.56 --> 6488.46
of triggered fundies even more triggered

6484.32 --> 6491.159
for a very long time I mean I will be

6488.46 --> 6493.38
their hell Master right I will be the

6491.159 --> 6494.94
devil that keeps whipping them for as

6493.38 --> 6497.219
long as I can

6494.94 --> 6499.86
as they are in hell I I will I will

6497.219 --> 6503.159
torture them for you I will gladly do

6499.86 --> 6506.88
that I will gladly torture them for

6503.159 --> 6509.699
their surrender to Satan I will gladly

6506.88 --> 6511.679
torture them the rest of their lives I

6509.699 --> 6514.138999999999
will do that for you but in order for me

6511.679 --> 6516.42
to do that I will need funding however

6514.139 --> 6517.8
through the PayPal patreon crypto wallet

6516.42 --> 6519.119
Super Chat and the membership system

6517.8 --> 6521.159000000001

6521.159 --> 6524.638999999999
anyway

6522.659 --> 6526.04
I will be back tomorrow with flat Earth

6524.639 --> 6529.4400000000005
early bird number

6526.04 --> 6531.06
1144 on the Wednesday and I'm going to

6529.44 --> 6534.0199999999995
join the Flat Earth debates which has

6531.06 --> 6534.02
just now started up

6534.3 --> 6538.9800000000005
right

6536.28 --> 6542.639
see you there in chat until the next

6538.98 --> 6546.299999999999
video keep it flat and when I mean when

6542.639 --> 6549.6
I say keep it flat I mean keep it flat

6546.3 --> 6552.0
right because it was always flat the

6549.6 --> 6555.360000000001
globe only ever existed in her mind

6552.0 --> 6557.099
which is the realm of Satan that's our

6555.36 --> 6559.44
imagination that's our fantasy that's

6557.099 --> 6561.179
our virtual space inside in there

6559.44 --> 6564.719
anything can happen

6561.179 --> 6567.42
but if you believe everything including

6564.719 --> 6572.76
the things that can actually happen you

6567.42 --> 6574.1990000000005
surrender to Satan the master of all

6572.76 --> 6576.96
lies

6574.199 --> 6581.219
is his domain

6576.96 --> 6583.7390000000005
the ball Earth Is His creation it's in

6581.219 --> 6587.52
honor of him it is the most fallacious

6583.739 --> 6588.659
concept humanity is ever created to

6587.52 --> 6590.46
honor

6588.659 --> 6591.96
Satan

6590.46 --> 6596.59
right

6591.96 --> 6627.869
so until the next video keep it flat

6596.59 --> 6627.869000000001
