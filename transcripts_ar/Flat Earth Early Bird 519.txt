yeah so today the weather is slightly

83.3 --> 89.57
colder

84.02 --> 94.42
it's the sweater it was really clouded

89.57 --> 98.74
but now there is some clear also though

94.42 --> 98.74000000000001
this has been kind of a fresh morning

99.2 --> 105.349
[Music]

102.039 --> 109.729
it's not bad it's not it hasn't been

105.349 --> 115.61
raining or anything but still was

109.729 --> 118.429
yesterday but oh well still fine so I

115.61 --> 125.38
was hanging around in chat over at Jason

118.429 --> 129.039
a desperate family it went live was I

125.38 --> 133.129
think 40 minutes ago or something and

129.039 --> 135.47
they're doing a peaceful resistance

133.129 --> 138.53
against the quarantine with a group of

135.47 --> 141.709
people yeah it's kind of like a hippy

138.53 --> 143.239
thing and it's it was awesome it was

141.709 --> 147.08
really good to sit there

143.239 --> 149.72
yeah listen in what Jason was streaming

147.08 --> 152.84
but yeah they were constantly there was

149.72 --> 157.76
like police very quickly on the scene

152.84 --> 161.51
and they were like just not really doing

157.76 --> 165.10999999999999
anything they were trying to sort of

161.51 --> 167.959
like just be like we're here and we're

165.11 --> 174.13000000000002
everywhere and police horses even and

167.959 --> 174.13
like what so it's still going on

174.25 --> 189.099
what is this what is what are all these

177.379 --> 193.88
links alright yeah that's yeah Jason

189.099 --> 198.53
Jason stream yeah I had a meeting just

193.88 --> 201.799
linked to that I put it out earlier but

198.53 --> 203.45
yeah that's still going down so yeah I

201.799 --> 209.239
got a bit of aggressive in chat there

203.45 --> 213.5
because it's just I guess it's good I'm

209.239 --> 215.9
not there because I would enjoy it but I

213.5 --> 220.72
would just get so annoyed by the police

215.9 --> 220.72
I think

227.959 --> 233.359
yeah I also I watched a movie yesterday

230.87 --> 237.079
with was pretty rough like a revenge

233.359 --> 239.209
porn movie and that kind of like in a

237.079 --> 242.269
way got to me as well it was kind of

239.209 --> 244.01
ridiculous but interesting as well it

242.269 --> 246.5
was like the last Rambo movie I've seen

244.01 --> 248.29899999999998
all of them now I already thought the

246.5 --> 252.98
previous one was pretty damn violent but

248.299 --> 256.449
it was still like in the same line of

252.98 --> 258.65
the originals and it seems like

256.449 --> 261.32
Sylvester Stallone has kept the

258.65 --> 263.78
character kind of consistent so I

261.32 --> 267.349
thought that element about it was kind

263.78 --> 269.44899999999996
of like it was good enough it was

267.349 --> 271.31
interesting but man that that whole

269.449 --> 272.77000000000004
thing that whole movie was just giant

271.31 --> 277.099
revenge porn

272.77 --> 279.919
it was pretty yeah it was just downright

277.099 --> 283.49
gruesome kind of like that the one

279.919 --> 290.389
before that so that so now I'm a bit

283.49 --> 292.61
like her because yeah Rambo like in that

290.389 --> 294.62
and that fire movie really gets to a

292.61 --> 296.63
point where he literally just doesn't

294.62 --> 304.61
give a [ __ ] about anything anymore

296.63 --> 307.19
and yeah just completely yeah willingly

304.61 --> 307.78000000000003
surrendering to revenge basically it's

307.19 --> 313.729
just

307.78 --> 316.54999999999995
and also it's kind of weird cuz and I'm

313.729 --> 318.31
talking about the movie right I will get

316.55 --> 321.08
to chat by the way soon

318.31 --> 324.65
but as I was watching it I just realized

321.08 --> 328.909
that like as like the dark [ __ ] like

324.65 --> 333.59
this the tone was set technically he

328.909 --> 336.65
could have just walked away and well

333.59 --> 339.979
that but the weird thing was about it is

336.65 --> 342.83
that he literally like chose to go on a

339.979 --> 345.02
revenge even though technically he

342.83 --> 346.849
didn't need to it was extremely

345.02 --> 350.63
dangerous he literally just started a

346.849 --> 356.21
war just starting a war just like that

350.63 --> 362.2
and yeah against the the opponent which

356.21 --> 362.2
was like a very creepy Mexican

363.53 --> 371.15999999999997
like slave sex slavery drug gang they

368.79 --> 375.99
they were absolutely disgusting and so

371.16 --> 378.15000000000003
yeah it was yeah it was what it was it's

375.99 --> 379.59000000000003
just one of those movies probably not a

378.15 --> 388.77
whim a lot of women that liked that

379.59 --> 392.88
movie but I did see it

388.77 --> 398.88
and oh by the way thank you Cleary for

392.88 --> 401.61
the $5 super chair donation yeah also I

398.88 --> 404.729
had I really have to shout out I got a

401.61 --> 408.09000000000003
surprise PayPal yesterday from James

404.729 --> 411.15
Mason all of a sudden I don't know if he

408.09 --> 414.96
even announced that but just bang like

411.15 --> 415.65
fifty two euros man holy [ __ ] then and

414.96 --> 420.38899999999995
that's good

415.65 --> 422.96
oh yeah that's I need that like this is

420.389 --> 428.16
actually if this keeps up if all of you

422.96 --> 431.88
guys and girls keep this up then I'll

428.16 --> 435.39000000000004
just because I'm I'm yeah to be fair I'm

431.88 --> 437.58
kind of like at a plus now and I'm

435.39 --> 439.74
really doing my best net not to let it

437.58 --> 442.77
rise to my head and just realize like no

439.74 --> 444.72
no no I need to save that up they want

442.77 --> 447.99
to get a fresh air system and our rally

444.72 --> 453.45000000000005
I can feel the time ticking because I'm

447.99 --> 456.419
getting more respiratory problems just

453.45 --> 458.82
standard problems that I haven't had in

456.419 --> 461.94
a long time I think because of these

458.82 --> 463.289
machines because much of the other

461.94 --> 468.15
things that have been doing it hasn't

463.289 --> 470.31
changed lot yeah so I need to save that

468.15 --> 472.5
up and it's working with all the support

470.31 --> 475.37
it is working so I thank you so much

472.5 --> 479.19
James Mason thank you everyone else as

475.37 --> 484.65
vividly supported me it's yeah yours

479.19 --> 486.78
you're extending my lifespan if I don't

484.65 --> 488.96
mess it up and I really didn't we're

486.78 --> 491.21
best enough to do that anyway

488.96 --> 495.79999999999995
before I get the chat I got Tamara

491.21 --> 498.38
coffee and green tea stop getting so

495.8 --> 500.12
distracted so yeah today's to set a show

498.38 --> 505.599
to Saturday show anyway so it's gonna be

500.12 --> 511.06
long and he wants squirting yet

505.599 --> 511.06
turpentine yeah I don't know misery bear

517.13 --> 522.82
maybe I could do something like that

520.25 --> 525.86
through my dad he's had all these

522.82 --> 529.3100000000001
different types of methods that he knows

525.86 --> 531.8000000000001
of and it has access to and has

529.31 --> 534.8299999999999
knowledge about so maybe he knows

531.8 --> 539.2099999999999
something about that they probably did

534.83 --> 541.94
dot does but I don't know if that's

539.21 --> 548.84
gonna really help me currently because

541.94 --> 550.2800000000001
other then I don't know me yeah dude is

548.84 --> 551.27
still getting kind of stressed out

550.28 --> 554.51
sometimes

551.27 --> 557.36
my health is doing pretty good I'm

554.51 --> 562.46
taking yeah good enough quality

557.36 --> 563.9
supplements not too many and I'm still

562.46 --> 568.4000000000001
eating organic and good I'm actually

563.9 --> 570.8
eating slightly more because I feel that

568.4 --> 573.29
I don't know there there's need for it

570.8 --> 575.75
I think it's spring I think I'm probably

573.29 --> 578.7199999999999
just automatically building more muscle

575.75 --> 583.16
it just happens it's you know I use the

578.72 --> 586.0400000000001
same amount of effort in doing things

583.16 --> 588.4699999999999
like turning regular things into a sport

586.04 --> 591.53
effective not really fanatically but if

588.47 --> 593.96
I have fanatically enough to keep it

591.53 --> 595.31
going as it were and normally during the

593.96 --> 597.35
winter times you know that doesn't

595.31 --> 599.66
really make a difference it just keeps

597.35 --> 601.6700000000001
me warm keeps me going but I don't know

599.66 --> 603.8299999999999
in the springtime just doing the same

601.67 --> 606.9499999999999
things apparently builds me a little bit

603.83 --> 609.44
more muscle but I do get more hungry

606.95 --> 610.8100000000001
it's that's just that's just how it

609.44 --> 616.85
seems to work

610.81 --> 623.39
so anyway getting to the chat now all

616.85 --> 629.8100000000001
right Amanda Young was first Steve Jim

623.39 --> 631.67
Jones creation bear good servant yeah I

629.81 --> 634.79
saw a good servant I saw your latest

631.67 --> 642.11
upload with page it was interesting and

634.79 --> 643.4
bit typical but I yeah yeah I don't even

642.11 --> 645.0500000000001
want to get in between anymore but I

643.4 --> 647.3
would just be an annoying person

645.05 --> 649.26
constantly no you shouldn't do this you

647.3 --> 654.12
shouldn't do that

649.26 --> 657.6899999999999
I just be a giant stick in the mud and

654.12 --> 660.32
not one that can supposedly prove the

657.69 --> 665.2790000000001
earth is a globe by presupposing it is

660.32 --> 667.0790000000001
in between the stars not that sort of

665.279 --> 673.11
usage of the stick-in-the-mud

667.079 --> 676.529
anyway brand em I'm sorry bear they lie

673.11 --> 682.85
oh I owe the atom aiken-rhett Priestley

676.529 --> 682.85
101 rock hound Cleary

690.3 --> 700.29
need to connect george sanford jeffrey

695.22 --> 703.47
bill no squirting yet ooh no super jet

700.29 --> 708.8399999999999
who just when they arrived at the bottom

703.47 --> 712.47
yeah Guns of Navarone RMP thanks for the

708.84 --> 714.39
stop by and thank you for the 30

712.47 --> 717.6
Canadian dollar super cheddar nation

714.39 --> 722.46
hope this helps a bit yes it it will it

717.6 --> 725.6700000000001
will a bit at least it's good for my my

722.46 --> 735.38
jeans come score that the government

725.67 --> 735.38
gets to see you know yeah we are

737.21 --> 743.7900000000001
mmm just I was just thinking like what

740.73 --> 746.34
the situation it's like my social

743.79 --> 748.02
welfare and what's retracted from the

746.34 --> 750.36
Google income and this and then how to

748.02 --> 753.47
perceive it I guess that technically the

750.36 --> 757.83
super Chad donations kind of keep

753.47 --> 759.63
effectively I don't know it's hard to to

757.83 --> 761.88
measure it out but effectively it is

759.63 --> 765.24
kind of keeping the government off my

761.88 --> 770.75
back about my social welfare because it

765.24 --> 774.12
is showing a group yeah an income and

770.75 --> 777.21
they know that if they get pushy that

774.12 --> 780.03
that may then risk that income and they

777.21 --> 782.37
don't want me to draw back again I why

780.03 --> 785.6999999999999
would they they know that the more

782.37 --> 787.29
desperate I get the more angry and out

785.7 --> 790.97
of control I tend to get the more

787.29 --> 793.65
problems I have with that and yeah

790.97 --> 796.5600000000001
because I'm pretty freaky to some people

793.65 --> 800.25
out there there are some normies that

796.56 --> 802.8
are just having jobs and the government

800.25 --> 805.53
jobs and they're like such normies they

802.8 --> 807.81
have no idea how to deal with somebody

805.53 --> 810.39
like me and in the mind that I have and

807.81 --> 813.68
I'm not like a super predictable sivanna

810.39 --> 816.63
at it you know that's their main fear

813.68 --> 818.3399999999999
because they're so Vanya is out here

816.63 --> 820.83
that like who the girl is doing is a

818.34 --> 821.9300000000001
little bit like that you know but that's

820.83 --> 824.2900000000001
kind of predictable

821.93 --> 827.4799999999999
they kind of know how to deal with that

824.29 --> 831.23
by with somebody like me that has really

827.48 --> 833.8100000000001
calm and then can explain something very

831.23 --> 837.65
well-spoken in any situation with some

833.81 --> 839.78
pressure and arrogance to it and doesn't

837.65 --> 842.12
go out for sivanna about it it just

839.78 --> 846.35
really clears up what's going on it

842.12 --> 850.25
blows them away it always has in my

846.35 --> 853.7
experience so they know it's like no

850.25 --> 857.36
this guy he just needs to gradually

853.7 --> 859.9100000000001
climb up because if we're gonna bother

857.36 --> 862.4
him and try to artificially maneuver him

859.91 --> 866.66
in some position we will is gonna get

862.4 --> 871.04
dangerous and they don't want that you

866.66 --> 873.77
know cuz that's just more problems they

871.04 --> 879.02
have to deal with directly or indirectly

873.77 --> 881.4499999999999
or they have to yeah the what if

879.02 --> 883.79
somebody comes to them like God were you

881.45 --> 886.07
responsible for this person he's now

883.79 --> 890.2099999999999
gone nuts or something you know they're

886.07 --> 893.24
afraid of that too it's these things

890.21 --> 897.02
matter it's so weird how that works this

893.24 --> 899.39
is all intangible basically there is

897.02 --> 902.27
just the program that people follow and

899.39 --> 905.06
then their inner world and how they try

902.27 --> 908.3
to deal with everything else and it's

905.06 --> 912.0799999999999
not always what you think it is they try

908.3 --> 914.87
to hide it to each individual because of

912.08 --> 916.82
the system that makes them hide it

914.87 --> 919.61
because if they show it to blatantly to

916.82 --> 923.96
the wrong person they'll get damaged for

919.61 --> 926.27
it but on an individual level these

923.96 --> 931.22
things sometimes become available when

926.27 --> 935.06
you just show them you're absolutely not

931.22 --> 937.34
a part of the mind control like but are

935.06 --> 938.27
not so Vanier because if you're so funny

937.34 --> 940.64
you're out of control

938.27 --> 942.5
you can't hold you hear something and

940.64 --> 947.48
then you shout it out the most extreme

942.5 --> 951.98
[ __ ] without any idea of what it

947.48 --> 954.24
actually does and it's just without any

951.98 --> 957.8100000000001
balance or sophistication to it

954.24 --> 960.9300000000001
and they know how to deal with that

957.81 --> 965.279
there is there is a system to account

960.93 --> 968.8199999999999
for that effect a natural type of

965.279 --> 972.66
emergence of a character type in the

968.82 --> 976.47
society but they can't account for

972.66 --> 981.0889999999999
somebody that has all the knowledge yet

976.47 --> 986.97
it can really be subtle and careful yet

981.089 --> 989.82
adamant and like break with the the

986.97 --> 995.399
tougher personal allusions and prove

989.82 --> 997.649
that like saying no at the right times

995.399 --> 1006.339
and not at the wrong times because it's

997.649 --> 1006.339
difficult to figure that out anyway

1006.76 --> 1015.17
that was quite a read right so that's my

1012.98 --> 1018.14
situation it's going quite well I have

1015.17 --> 1021.1999999999999
to say I have plans

1018.14 --> 1027.069
Oh every time money comes rolling in and

1021.2 --> 1027.069
that's just it I get ideas it's that's

1027.76 --> 1035.3
yeah but yeah I'm used to that [ __ ] it's

1032.3 --> 1037.579
like yeah yeah whatever whatever Lucifer

1085.71 --> 1094.6100000000001
absolutely will I'm yeah if this keeps

1089.94 --> 1098.4
up I'll have it in made and probably

1094.61 --> 1102.3
doomed at last like that that's I'm

1098.4 --> 1106.3700000000001
definitely gonna get it I must be unless

1102.3 --> 1106.37
things get really crazy but I doubt it

1107.0 --> 1114.18
it's gonna be a good summer I hope I'm

1110.37 --> 1116.7299999999998
gonna gotta be careful you know because

1114.18 --> 1120.0900000000001
this is effectively for me it is kind of

1116.73 --> 1124.77
like a climb but every time I climb I

1120.09 --> 1126.84
always get nervous because yeah that's

1124.77 --> 1129.6
when Lucifer starts to reach out and

1126.84 --> 1134.1799999999998
like suggest all these glorious things

1129.6 --> 1136.32
that are all gonna make you stumble I

1134.18 --> 1142.74
don't know that's what seems to happen

1136.32 --> 1144.6599999999999
with me a lot or distract me how much do

1142.74 --> 1148.92
you still need for the purifier well it

1144.66 --> 1153.69
still costs the same so it's 500 euros

1148.92 --> 1154.74
500 something don't remember but I know

1153.69 --> 1158.42
it's climbing

1154.74 --> 1164.91
it's just climbing and technically I

1158.42 --> 1167.91
don't really know it's just as if this

1164.91 --> 1175.23
keeps up this rate I'm definitely gonna

1167.91 --> 1178.95
make it well that's it no I'm not really

1175.23 --> 1184.95
getting rich misery bear but well maybe

1178.95 --> 1188.72
I guess but yeah rich rich it's in the

1184.95 --> 1192.21
Netherlands anyway so it's not that rich

1188.72 --> 1197.7
but but anyway yeah I do feel very

1192.21 --> 1201.15
wealthy and it's like yeah it really

1197.7 --> 1204.0
makes me feel appreciated you know in a

1201.15 --> 1206.76
way getting this money is worth more

1204.0 --> 1207.549
than maybe getting ten times that by

1206.76 --> 1212.739
some autumn

1207.549 --> 1214.69
check that makes you do all kinds of

1212.739 --> 1218.23
things or stop doing all kinds of things

1214.69 --> 1225.809
that there really is no good reason for

1218.23 --> 1225.809
that so yeah this is worth a lot to me

1232.739 --> 1237.57
but I don't know if you'd say like how

1235.48 --> 1242.08
much do I need anymore

1237.57 --> 1244.359
I'd say I'm probably halfway but again

1242.08 --> 1247.149
like this is how it is it's the app in

1244.359 --> 1250.21
the flood if it just stops then it's

1247.149 --> 1253.6789999999999
probably gonna yeah that numbers gonna

1250.21 --> 1253.679
crumble it's about the momentum

1258.8 --> 1266.27
yeah in in a way that I guess that does

1261.5 --> 1269.78
sound like just keep throwing one hit me

1266.27 --> 1273.47
and I will get it it has to be you know

1269.78 --> 1275.87
at some point I definitely don't have

1273.47 --> 1279.32
some like alternative secret plan or

1275.87 --> 1284.78
something I'm definitely I definitely

1279.32 --> 1286.49
want a new fresh air system I feel

1284.78 --> 1289.42
that's like yeah it is definitely

1286.49 --> 1289.42
Priority One

1294.44 --> 1302.96
bring on the rapture what really I don't

1300.35 --> 1310.55
even know like what the rapture really

1302.96 --> 1313.82
is at this point I'm yeah it's like all

1310.55 --> 1322.55
these things these specific events you

1313.82 --> 1324.35
know it's almost like if you take them

1322.55 --> 1326.21
into your mind if you take them into

1324.35 --> 1328.1899999999998
account that they could be real what

1326.21 --> 1329.18
I'll send you more on Monday to pick Wow

1328.19 --> 1332.39
Thank You Brandon

1329.18 --> 1336.3100000000002
that's so thank you so much and that's

1332.39 --> 1338.7800000000002
awesome I'm looking forward to that

1336.31 --> 1343.7
anyway but with the rapture it is like

1338.78 --> 1347.87
this all these suppose it's specific

1343.7 --> 1351.46
events you know what do what does the

1347.87 --> 1354.6799999999998
inside of them do to you

1351.46 --> 1360.98
what does it make you focus is it is it

1354.68 --> 1363.8
not just a distraction you know because

1360.98 --> 1366.29
the more I think about all these soap

1363.8 --> 1368.45
supposed events that are described or

1366.29 --> 1370.1
these elements and how people respond to

1368.45 --> 1372.23
them and how they get all obsessed over

1370.1 --> 1377.6299999999999
them you know I'm just thinking more and

1372.23 --> 1380.08
more the the way to do it right and the

1377.63 --> 1383.21
key insights are all there in the Bible

1380.08 --> 1386.4499999999998
just gotta focus on what Jesus actually

1383.21 --> 1390.68
does and says right

1386.45 --> 1396.05
and all these specific events if you

1390.68 --> 1398.2
just do keep in mind the key of Jesus's

1396.05 --> 1401.3
sacrifice that to change the plan and

1398.2 --> 1403.25
off his ways to do that for your own

1401.3 --> 1406.04
code of conduct and keep that in mind in

1403.25 --> 1411.53
the balance and all that then does it

1406.04 --> 1415.07
even matter what will happen cuz the key

1411.53 --> 1417.8
is every time is just basically keep

1415.07 --> 1420.59
building keep crushing as Owen Benjamin

1417.8 --> 1423.05
says it follow logos whenever you can

1420.59 --> 1426.51
deal with all the challenges faced

1423.05 --> 1429.79
head-on if you can

1426.51 --> 1432.01
as quickly as she can and it doesn't

1429.79 --> 1435.8799999999999
really matter then what comes on your

1432.01 --> 1439.03
path or the event it is just if you do

1435.88 --> 1442.24
things right if you follow the way of

1439.03 --> 1446.11
Christ the path of Christ then you will

1442.24 --> 1450.01
do it right it has to be that's part of

1446.11 --> 1453.1599999999999
what is in there that that is kind of

1450.01 --> 1455.5
like the formula so focusing on these

1453.16 --> 1457.6000000000001
specific is like the rapture whether

1455.5 --> 1459.61
that is real or what how you should even

1457.6 --> 1463.27
interpret it like is that literal or is

1459.61 --> 1467.05
that some pure spirit thing you know

1463.27 --> 1470.05
there's so many angles to things at this

1467.05 --> 1474.76
point like the interdimensional angle to

1470.05 --> 1480.1599999999999
it like endless it's like it it's

1474.76 --> 1482.17
driving me to like fatigue when I

1480.16 --> 1485.0800000000002
consider all the angles to all these

1482.17 --> 1487.66
situations and then how people get stuck

1485.08 --> 1491.8
on a very specific angle every time they

1487.66 --> 1494.16
always do they can't help it they get

1491.8 --> 1494.1599999999999
stuck

1495.89 --> 1503.9
they think it's literal well you know

1500.84 --> 1505.9399999999998
well if it's all literal then wouldn't

1503.9 --> 1510.5
that just be blatantly obvious you know

1505.94 --> 1513.6200000000001
a literal means an empirical physical

1510.5 --> 1516.17
thing to unfold right so yeah if it's

1513.62 --> 1519.1999999999998
gonna happen especially you like how

1516.17 --> 1523.01
that's all this Christ it's gonna be

1519.2 --> 1525.44
very difficult to to mistake that unless

1523.01 --> 1527.69
you are literally drowning in lies and

1525.44 --> 1531.919
delusion in the reversed world idea then

1527.69 --> 1535.0700000000002
you may like see like a pattern of that

1531.919 --> 1537.919
in something that is presented like an

1535.07 --> 1539.72
extra illusion to almost falsely make

1537.919 --> 1541.7
those people think that there is some

1539.72 --> 1544.22
kind of like rapture going on even

1541.7 --> 1546.95
though it is exactly the opposite or

1544.22 --> 1550.84
something like that it's you know that

1546.95 --> 1555.41
kind of [ __ ] can happen but the real

1550.84 --> 1558.29
rapture like exactly like serious if

1555.41 --> 1561.41
that happens it's well it is even like

1558.29 --> 1564.1689999999999
said right it is unmistakable but if it

1561.41 --> 1566.66
is unmistakable it is it unmistakable in

1564.169 --> 1570.41
the real world is there such a thing as

1566.66 --> 1572.929
a conscious time-bound linear experience

1570.41 --> 1577.94
where something is absolutely

1572.929 --> 1583.64
unmistakable is that possible or is that

1577.94 --> 1589.669
only possible in the dark world you know

1583.64 --> 1592.3400000000001
because isn't it that when something is

1589.669 --> 1595.25
unmistakable that maybe everyone in a

1592.34 --> 1598.34
moment in a dream just all connects and

1595.25 --> 1600.29
then something is revealed like on the

1598.34 --> 1603.1399999999999
other side and you're connected into

1600.29 --> 1605.809
that like like almost it would seem like

1603.14 --> 1610.5490000000002
a reset effect but it's like a maybe a

1605.809 --> 1612.6499999999999
game update more game update but yeah

1610.549 --> 1615.47
like like an update from the other side

1612.65 --> 1618.3500000000001
and then yeah things might be

1615.47 --> 1622.809
unmistakable and then people get back to

1618.35 --> 1625.9099999999999
their normal time time linear life and

1622.809 --> 1628.1
then they are probably very inclined to

1625.91 --> 1629.78
think it is a pure dream again Africa

1628.1 --> 1638.75
about it and get distracted by their

1629.78 --> 1644.299
nonsense because I have memories of that

1638.75 --> 1646.94
type of experience moments and it and it

1644.299 --> 1652.82
did seem like I could communicate with

1646.94 --> 1656.51
people that I've never physically even

1652.82 --> 1660.6789999999999
met or that I would meet later and I

1656.51 --> 1665.0
would not go to them I would just be

1660.679 --> 1666.23
there then just like step towards like

1665.0 --> 1670.52
almost stepping out of the shadow

1666.23 --> 1672.34
towards a person on the other side talk

1670.52 --> 1674.75
to them or whatever hear them out and

1672.34 --> 1676.82
then go somewhere else but there would

1674.75 --> 1681.02
be no trip to work there was no time

1676.82 --> 1683.83
linear nough sits just you were there so

1681.02 --> 1687.26
it's almost like a spirit internet

1683.83 --> 1692.4189999999999
experience that's what I remember during

1687.26 --> 1695.48
these weird like a reset feel like

1692.419 --> 1699.01
moments and they were all yet there have

1695.48 --> 1703.809
been multiple of them and I generally

1699.01 --> 1703.809
conceived them as dark world experiences

1704.26 --> 1713.539
and I don't have a lot of background

1709.669 --> 1718.22
research concerning this I only really

1713.539 --> 1721.72
have my own bizarre fresh experiences to

1718.22 --> 1725.69
reflect upon I've heard other people

1721.72 --> 1727.64
like shaman types even in the past that

1725.69 --> 1730.669
were kind of serious I think I never

1727.64 --> 1734.0590000000002
really got to know them they did kind of

1730.669 --> 1736.73
relay similar experiences with

1734.059 --> 1738.6789999999999
psychotropics induced situation so I

1736.73 --> 1740.299
learned some of it but it's always been

1738.679 --> 1742.4
very superficial it's not something that

1740.299 --> 1744.77
I like read books about all that you

1742.4 --> 1748.3300000000002
know it's mostly have my own unique

1744.77 --> 1751.1299999999999
experiences to reflect upon with this

1748.33 --> 1755.49
but yeah I remember one of these things

1751.13 --> 1765.24
in 2012 50

1755.49 --> 1769.2
and 1997 and yeah somewhere in I don't

1765.24 --> 1772.28
know 2005 or something it it's yeah that

1769.2 --> 1774.69
whole period like that ten years after

1772.28 --> 1782.1299999999999
1997 is just chaos

1774.69 --> 1783.9
pretty much it's very it's very lost for

1782.13 --> 1795.5590000000002
a very long time like in the sense that

1783.9 --> 1800.16
I really did not know who I was anyway

1795.559 --> 1807.47
so did definitely got off at his mega

1800.16 --> 1807.47
tangent there totally something weird

1813.33 --> 1823.5
the Antichrist is coming really so what

1817.05 --> 1826.56
is the what is what is he you know if

1823.5 --> 1829.02
you if you'd say an antichrist spirit

1826.56 --> 1834.98
I'd say he's already been there for a

1829.02 --> 1837.98
while but as an individual like what

1834.98 --> 1837.98
individual

1840.99 --> 1847.92
it just seems like a spirit a hungry

1844.62 --> 1851.3999999999999
hungry spirit that typically arrives in

1847.92 --> 1853.65
places where power culminates and it's

1851.4 --> 1854.24
like a mindset that has a life of its

1853.65 --> 1858.99
own

1854.24 --> 1863.64
like a sub being that just rides on the

1858.99 --> 1866.28
top of of the minds of people that are

1863.64 --> 1874.8300000000002
kind of out of control and what they're

1866.28 --> 1877.94
into but is that an individual I'd say

1874.83 --> 1877.9399999999998
it's more like a spirit

1895.03 --> 1904.82
marks my lair dude let's stop leaving

1901.16 --> 1906.44
these page comments in my comment

1904.82 --> 1915.1399999999999
section please it's getting kind of

1906.44 --> 1917.3600000000001
annoying I know who you are you've been

1915.14 --> 1920.14
around for a while and you have very odd

1917.36 --> 1920.1399999999999
opinions

1933.51 --> 1942.42
you might be the common good servants

1936.96 --> 1947.7
come on man don't do that to me please

1942.42 --> 1951.0
that is look look at what you just said

1947.7 --> 1951.0

2037.15 --> 2040.249
[Music]

2057.24 --> 2070.2299999999996
yeah exactly Steve look good serpent you

2063.56 --> 2072.869
can't just think you've won like you've

2070.23 --> 2079.349
made it if you think you've made it in

2072.869 --> 2083.21
your life like if you would think that

2079.349 --> 2086.909
you are literally ready to go then

2083.21 --> 2090.899
you're yeah you're basically ending the

2086.909 --> 2092.609
struggle effectively if you really

2090.899 --> 2098.8489999999997
really think about it it kind of means

2092.609 --> 2107.69
you lose don't want to get harsh but

2098.849 --> 2107.69
yeah you don't know if you're ready

2109.43 --> 2119.8799999999997
yeah but Jesus did the work but that

2112.74 --> 2122.99
doesn't mean that it's over he just he

2119.88 --> 2122.9900000000002
just changed the game

2139.22 --> 2145.04
ha I like that for a niche the struggle

2141.89 --> 2151.31
is the blessing it it is it is the curse

2145.04 --> 2159.79
and the blessing it all depends on how

2151.31 --> 2163.089
you're gonna let it change you that's it

2159.79 --> 2166.19
so anything can be a curse or a blessing

2163.089 --> 2169.0099999999998
depending on your approach and what

2166.19 --> 2173.17
you're gonna let it do with you now what

2169.01 --> 2173.17
you're gonna look at and what happens

2176.109 --> 2183.8289999999997
yeah now it's okay good don't worry it's

2179.18 --> 2186.44
just every time I see this like oh yeah

2183.829 --> 2188.7200000000003
I'm a Christian I I really figured it

2186.44 --> 2194.78
out I'm ready to die it's like really

2188.72 --> 2198.109
the no that's that's called mania that

2194.78 --> 2200.7200000000003
that feels like Lucifer that's trying to

2198.109 --> 2204.619
tell you wow you won the game you can do

2200.72 --> 2206.5989999999997
you can get all ecstatic now you know

2204.619 --> 2211.75
that's what that sounds to me no it's

2206.599 --> 2215.569
never over this it never is not really

2211.75 --> 2218.54
you can give yourself some some relief

2215.569 --> 2225.71
time you know you can reward yourself

2218.54 --> 2229.579
for figuring out some new things or just

2225.71 --> 2232.569
yeah yeah attaining new disciplines that

2229.579 --> 2232.569
kind of thing you know

2234.64 --> 2238.589
I know creation Barrett

2243.76 --> 2250.8390000000004
time for some squirt timeout you want to

2249.13 --> 2253.48
get a squirt timeout Jeffrey bill you're

2250.839 --> 2255.97
using to be talking about squirting a

2253.48 --> 2261.42
lot I don't see a lot of squirting going

2255.97 --> 2261.4199999999996
on in my chat so far not today at least

2262.33 --> 2265.489
[Music]

2270.57 --> 2276.98
Romans 10 and 9 what why why

2312.28 --> 2321.25
okay that's a fascinating conception

2315.31 --> 2325.75
voyage that that really is that's that's

2321.25 --> 2328.18
not just a well it is a very rough and

2325.75 --> 2334.24
surreal lesson but it's a lesson that

2328.18 --> 2336.6699999999996
I've heard many times because whether it

2334.24 --> 2341.77
is in your living life or literally

2336.67 --> 2344.94
after death that is a way to conceive it

2341.77 --> 2344.94
it's like

2350.28 --> 2355.98
yeah yeah comparing it to trees again I

2353.64 --> 2358.23
keep on doing this I mean if a tree's at

2355.98 --> 2363.15
some point gets caught in the storm and

2358.23 --> 2366.5
a branch breaks off it's not yeah that

2363.15 --> 2369.89
branch breaks off and it's not gonna

2366.5 --> 2372.45
basically give up living because of that

2369.89 --> 2378.21
it's just gonna keep on growing and then

2372.45 --> 2380.6699999999996
eventually the growth will kind of outdo

2378.21 --> 2385.77
the original break off of the branch

2380.67 --> 2390.02
even concealing it a little so it's

2385.77 --> 2392.55
always like yeah you have to move on

2390.02 --> 2395.34
like you have to kind of move on no

2392.55 --> 2398.79
matter what really happens and if you

2395.34 --> 2400.9500000000003
stop planning to move on then it's

2398.79 --> 2402.93
usually because you got stuck into

2400.95 --> 2407.7799999999997
something you can't move on from and

2402.93 --> 2407.7799999999997
then you you get into trouble for it

2431.69 --> 2437.89
what a weird comment there at Missouri

2435.589 --> 2437.89
Bear

2450.53 --> 2466.0
ha thanks anyway

2460.4 --> 2466.0
my general advice is to just not spiral

2466.06 --> 2474.92
don't get obsessed with even with creepy

2473.18 --> 2478.73
parts you know there's there [ __ ] in my

2474.92 --> 2482.69
head now that's been that going on

2478.73 --> 2486.85
forever and like every time I get

2482.69 --> 2490.64
reminded about that from some movie

2486.85 --> 2493.5499999999997
anything like that it just brings back

2490.64 --> 2495.5299999999997
all the [ __ ] like all the ways in which

2493.55 --> 2500.48
I have been confronted with that in one

2495.53 --> 2502.52
way or another yeah and what can I do

2500.48 --> 2504.62
with that I can then just start looking

2502.52 --> 2513.32
at the old stuff again and obsessing

2504.62 --> 2516.04
over it again or I could just yeah try

2513.32 --> 2519.44
to somehow even though it should not be

2516.04 --> 2523.19
give it a spot in existence in the

2519.44 --> 2526.04
spectrum of all things and then somehow

2523.19 --> 2530.42
figure out on the long run over time how

2526.04 --> 2532.67
to kind of deal with that like what

2530.42 --> 2537.4
could even be done and figure out even

2532.67 --> 2541.4
like why does that exist how has that

2537.4 --> 2545.63
manifested and why would it keep

2541.4 --> 2552.04
returning that kind of thing like like

2545.63 --> 2552.04
what are these people what is that

2559.29 --> 2566.75
and yeah not so much on the just the

2563.1 --> 2566.75
gruesome deeds and [ __ ]

2569.68 --> 2572.83
[Music]

2601.03 --> 2606.8100000000004
yeah saying let's sub is against the

2603.91 --> 2606.81
guidelines is it

2618.13 --> 2627.79
what Fanta boy who's that No

2631.33 --> 2640.5
uh okay some of these sounds like it bit

2637.54 --> 2640.5
of a troll there

2640.59 --> 2643.659
[Music]

2649.02 --> 2665.03
yeah pretty sure that's a troll okay

2669.86 --> 2672.9190000000003
[Music]

2673.22 --> 2677.5699999999997
anything special happening

2689.4 --> 2697.4700000000003
squirt him out now no not yet

2702.71 --> 2709.4900000000002
oh right I've been noticing something

2704.81 --> 2714.38
weird from D live you know there's like

2709.49 --> 2717.35
ad life following thing like an option

2714.38 --> 2720.08
where you're supposed to see who's going

2717.35 --> 2722.33
live well it used to be when I got there

2720.08 --> 2724.4
you'd see literally who was limes life

2722.33 --> 2726.86
streaming and who had a repeat thing

2724.4 --> 2731.06
going and how it doesn't show that I

2726.86 --> 2733.73
actually have to click following to even

2731.06 --> 2739.1
see if their life so what the hell is

2733.73 --> 2746.71
this new nonsense D life are you getting

2739.1 --> 2746.71
grappled what is this just ah

2762.03 --> 2769.59
okay Jeffrey bill enough with the

2764.16 --> 2772.3799999999997
squirting already like if every single

2769.59 --> 2775.08
sentence you're putting down here has

2772.38 --> 2783.77
squirt in it then technically you are

2775.08 --> 2783.77
squirting so don't ya don't overdo it

2785.38 --> 2788.399
[Music]

2788.99 --> 2794.8799999999997
and I know the problem because I love to

2792.09 --> 2796.6800000000003
use the word squirting as well but you

2794.88 --> 2799.92
can't overdo it because then you are

2796.68 --> 2803.6099999999997
technically squirting you only gotta use

2799.92 --> 2809.989
it when it's really appropriate

2803.61 --> 2809.989
[Music]

2814.55 --> 2825.15
what's unicorns layer what do you think

2817.8 --> 2827.51
that's a lot turkey really what does

2825.15 --> 2827.51
that mean

2845.88 --> 2850.11
no really like what does that mean

2848.01 --> 2863.9100000000003
unicorn Slayer can you elaborate a

2850.11 --> 2868.19
little okay wants to be the best

2863.91 --> 2868.19
platform in Turk how is that a sellout

2868.94 --> 2879.48
how's he selling out I mean like the

2876.15 --> 2883.65
current government over there isn't

2879.48 --> 2886.95
exactly like the nicest group out there

2883.65 --> 2889.86
if you know what I mean but like how is

2886.95 --> 2892.5499999999997
that selling out if he just wants to

2889.86 --> 2892.55
make it available

2898.64 --> 2908.6299999999997
like what are you saying there are like

2901.339 --> 2912.109
is is the life now putting out like

2908.63 --> 2914.119
censorship points based on what Turkey

2912.109 --> 2918.2599999999998
demands or something is that what you're

2914.119 --> 2926.319
saying they're not promoting any one but

2918.26 --> 2926.3190000000004
gamers now okay right

2934.43 --> 2942.8289999999997
okay I think I get it so hmm

2940.27 --> 2945.17
so you're saying what they're doing is

2942.829 --> 2950.869
kind of like in a way what Google did

2945.17 --> 2956.839
with China like become the state driver

2950.869 --> 2959.51
of certain mechanisms within yeah within

2956.839 --> 2961.94
that country and you're saying that the

2959.51 --> 2964.51
life is kind of done the same thing with

2961.94 --> 2964.51
Turkey

2968.5 --> 2971.67
[Music]

2983.18 --> 2989.6299999999997
that's that is freaky in a way that so

2987.53 --> 2996.88
it means that like all these platforms

2989.63 --> 2996.88
are kind of like nationalizing in a way

2999.76 --> 3004.32
that is that is so odd

3016.67 --> 3021.369
and what do you do in response to that

3019.069 --> 3021.369
you know

3031.08 --> 3037.2
I don't know it's to me I find it

3035.22 --> 3039.74
extremely bizarre that this kind of

3037.2 --> 3039.74
thing is even possible

3041.06 --> 3049.86
that especially platforms that are

3046.92 --> 3053.73
literally having these relationships

3049.86 --> 3058.29
with viewers and producers that they can

3053.73 --> 3063.12
just basically drop all of it off just

3058.29 --> 3070.29
drop it like that and do something else

3063.12 --> 3072.63
I almost find it kind of curious that

3070.29 --> 3078.0299999999997
that's even legal you know it's a it

3072.63 --> 3080.25
because it feels almost like it's it's a

3078.03 --> 3084.15
landlord situation and they're just like

3080.25 --> 3086.67
no no everybody's just gonna get out get

3084.15 --> 3088.56
out now now we're doing things

3086.67 --> 3090.39
differently you know these people are

3088.56 --> 3092.88
now moving well guess what if you do

3090.39 --> 3094.5899999999997
that in the world yeah there's going to

3092.88 --> 3098.1600000000003
be legal issues this actually shows that

3094.59 --> 3100.08
it there's yeah technically judicially

3098.16 --> 3102.33
it's been very difficult to get somebody

3100.08 --> 3106.14
out of the house if justice but the land

3102.33 --> 3111.72
warlord wanting it so why is it that

3106.14 --> 3113.97
easy for platform owners to just do

3111.72 --> 3120.7099999999996
these kind of things and just change the

3113.97 --> 3123.6899999999996
entire setting in which producers and

3120.71 --> 3127.02
viewers have approached it and worked

3123.69 --> 3131.13
with it see it's almost like they're

3127.02 --> 3134.42
breaking the contract of the set up that

3131.13 --> 3140.04
lured people in there in the first place

3134.42 --> 3144.05
why is that legal isn't that basically

3140.04 --> 3150.98
false advertisement when you look at it

3144.05 --> 3150.98
carefully or is this just me

3152.66 --> 3161.67
like why can social media platforms just

3156.329 --> 3165.299
sell out their entire user base on the

3161.67 --> 3170.359
whim of some executive director or

3165.299 --> 3170.359
something No

3183.9 --> 3202.079
I wonder if there is a system possible

3197.369 --> 3203.76
though I can think of it if I can think

3202.079 --> 3206.52
it up then somebody could probably

3203.76 --> 3211.0200000000004
program it but what if you have a

3206.52 --> 3214.65
completely decentralized video social

3211.02 --> 3219.44
media platform where everybody could

3214.65 --> 3222.539
basically have fragments of their own

3219.44 --> 3229.92
like everybody like if you'd have your

3222.539 --> 3232.4100000000003
own micro surfer micro server for what

3229.92 --> 3236.52
you do with your channel the backup for

3232.41 --> 3241.589
your videos and all that and you then

3236.52 --> 3244.22
make a network system out of that with

3241.589 --> 3248.19
all kinds of easy accessible

3244.22 --> 3251.25
decentralized storage so people that

3248.19 --> 3255.7400000000002
produce material have have literal

3251.25 --> 3258.9
physical ownership of it and then a

3255.74 --> 3263.1299999999997
system to easily connect on to a

3258.9 --> 3265.77
networking system like that so there is

3263.13 --> 3271.069
less centralized control over the

3265.77 --> 3273.569
content yet it remains easily accessible

3271.069 --> 3277.97
so it will kind of depend on like the

3273.569 --> 3280.5
quality server micro server that that a

3277.97 --> 3287.64
producer would have available for their

3280.5 --> 3292.43
work but maybe that way you could have a

3287.64 --> 3298.109
youtube network that doesn't depend on

3292.43 --> 3300.8089999999997
giant server hub buildings that reach

3298.109 --> 3307.619
around the world but more that just

3300.809 --> 3310.2200000000003
reach into everything where everything

3307.619 --> 3310.2200000000003
is decentralized

3311.15 --> 3321.359
more like an original Network idea but

3316.14 --> 3323.5789999999997
for social media like that you know

3321.359 --> 3326.67
there's already chat systems that kind

3323.579 --> 3330.509
of work like this that are widely

3326.67 --> 3335.069
utilized so why not do that with a

3330.509 --> 3342.509
YouTube type system or everybody could

3335.069 --> 3345.749
have their own server for specific for a

3342.509 --> 3353.989
piece of the puzzle in a social media

3345.749 --> 3355.3799999999997
platform system it's just an idea but

3353.989 --> 3359.4
yeah

3355.38 --> 3361.859
does this already exist in a way because

3359.4 --> 3363.599
now what I'm every time I get confronted

3361.859 --> 3365.63
with all the youtubers that have already

3363.599 --> 3368.839
known that are kind of trying out new

3365.63 --> 3371.5190000000002
platforms it's all seems to be like new

3368.839 --> 3374.489
centralized platforms and why well

3371.519 --> 3376.4689999999996
because centralized means if there is

3374.489 --> 3379.979
some server power then that makes

3376.469 --> 3382.529
smoother streams and all that so the

3379.979 --> 3385.91
bigger the more invested one of these

3382.529 --> 3389.809
new platforms is the easier access the

3385.91 --> 3392.67
more viable an alternative it becomes to

3389.809 --> 3399.0890000000004
monolithic or companies like Google and

3392.67 --> 3401.63
YouTube which they own but yeah then the

3399.089 --> 3403.949
more centralized monolithic an

3401.63 --> 3406.4390000000003
alternative platform becomes the more

3403.949 --> 3410.819
easily grabble they become and then the

3406.439 --> 3413.729
same [ __ ] as the mega corporation set

3410.819 --> 3418.229
ups happens I guess like with the life

3413.729 --> 3420.509
now that is as yeah unicorn Slayer said

3418.229 --> 3424.3799999999997
it so loud to Turkey nationalized into

3420.509 --> 3428.219
Turkey right so how do you evade that

3424.38 --> 3432.2690000000002
problem from continually happening well

3428.219 --> 3436.589
a completely decentralized YouTube alike

3432.269 --> 3440.8489999999997
system with micro server network hubs or

3436.589 --> 3442.16
every content maker provides their own

3440.849 --> 3444.44
server

3442.16 --> 3446.1499999999996
for their content but it would have to

3444.44 --> 3449.059
dare have the technology would have to

3446.15 --> 3452.359
adapt it would have to be easy it's not

3449.059 --> 3455.2400000000002
if you're gonna be forced to buy like a

3452.359 --> 3459.94
separate computer for this that's just

3455.24 --> 3462.5589999999997
gonna suck unless it's extremely cheap

3459.94 --> 3465.789
unless it's so cheap a computer system

3462.559 --> 3470.2690000000002
that it is basically like an SSD disk

3465.789 --> 3472.19
clicked in and that is the computer that

3470.269 --> 3475.1899999999996
would just have to be on day/night and

3472.19 --> 3478.67
plugged into a wire and that's it if

3475.19 --> 3481.46
that is sufficient to do that then it

3478.67 --> 3484.069
can work but if you have to have like a

3481.46 --> 3487.089
full server with centralized power and

3484.069 --> 3489.5589999999997
all that [ __ ] that's expensive

3487.089 --> 3491.299
then it's not gonna work because most

3489.559 --> 3495.65
people don't have access to them that

3491.299 --> 3498.17
nobody is gonna use then because now

3495.65 --> 3501.65
everybody's just piling on it has been

3498.17 --> 3505.609
piling onto YouTube forever like poor

3501.65 --> 3508.1600000000003
people even because they got the server

3505.609 --> 3514.63
space and the easy access for free from

3508.16 --> 3519.25
YouTube so unless it becomes that easily

3514.63 --> 3523.46
accessible and kind of almost free then

3519.25 --> 3527.72
nobody's gonna try it out so that's my

3523.46 --> 3529.849
prediction I'll yeah library you say you

3527.72 --> 3533.2099999999996
YouTube interesting but I don't know

3529.849 --> 3537.44
anything about lbr why library that

3533.21 --> 3540.099
system I don't know a lot about them but

3537.44 --> 3543.559
how it is crypto based in some way but

3540.099 --> 3548.0190000000002
what I'm talking about is is really

3543.559 --> 3552.65
different it would be a completely non

3548.019 --> 3557.7099999999996
centralised social media system with a

3552.65 --> 3557.71
net giant network of separated servers

3571.41 --> 3574.54
[Music]

3575.0 --> 3583.44
in a way it would almost be just like in

3580.23 --> 3584.97
yeah just like websites because websites

3583.44 --> 3586.8
are technically that and when you think

3584.97 --> 3589.95
about it it's just you have your own

3586.8 --> 3591.78
server you can do the website and it is

3589.95 --> 3594.93
accessible and then depending on how

3591.78 --> 3597.2000000000003
much access it's going to be it's gonna

3594.93 --> 3597.2
cost

3604.84 --> 3612.46
but yeah maybe that can be narrowed down

3608.86 --> 3614.98
even further like if because a website

3612.46 --> 3617.95
can technically do anything right

3614.98 --> 3619.93
it is technically capable of plugging

3617.95 --> 3621.73
all kinds of things to do anything you

3619.93 --> 3625.87
can imagine with you can literally put a

3621.73 --> 3628.69
web game on it or a game server anything

3625.87 --> 3630.97
can be done with that but if it's just

3628.69 --> 3633.4
for a social media platform like YouTube

3630.97 --> 3636.8399999999997
where it's just about the chat just

3633.4 --> 3641.08
about the video about live-streaming and

3636.84 --> 3643.06
having storage then all that structure

3641.08 --> 3646.7799999999997
all that program it can all be narrowed

3643.06 --> 3649.02
down extremely and the more code and

3646.78 --> 3653.4700000000003
options are narrowed down the less

3649.02 --> 3654.99
energy and bandwidth it's gonna take

3653.47 --> 3658.72
altogether

3654.99 --> 3662.35
so I think that by just going with the

3658.72 --> 3665.47
universal format at it and then letting

3662.35 --> 3671.92
people use that on micro servers I think

3665.47 --> 3674.5
it might work so if only I was a

3671.92 --> 3677.9500000000003
programmer or still was in programmer

3674.5 --> 3682.27
circles then I might just have now a

3677.95 --> 3684.46
project for a yeah a new media social

3682.27 --> 3691.2599999999998
media revolution this is but I think

3684.46 --> 3691.26
that this system can work potentially

3697.63 --> 3700.7490000000003
[Music]

3705.82 --> 3708.82
yeah

3710.62 --> 3717.63
[Music]

3730.02 --> 3734.5099999999998
that's enough with the trolling already

3749.41 --> 3753.67
Wow

3750.97 --> 3758.41
look how the weather is cleared up

3753.67 --> 3758.41
credible it was quick

3785.569 --> 3789.529
the big creators are gonna push back

3787.63 --> 3794.199
extremely hard okay that's interesting

3789.529 --> 3797.319
unicorns lair so which big creators

3794.199 --> 3801.049
exactly do you mean

3797.319 --> 3804.189
does that include own Benjamin because

3801.049 --> 3804.189
he is on there as well

3830.57 --> 3838.76
hmm oh look at that I got 12 up votes

3833.75 --> 3841.52
incredible I wonder if that's gonna be

3838.76 --> 3846.5
back to 2 or 3 again after the show

3841.52 --> 3849.32
has anybody note is that that it's the

3846.5 --> 3854.18
the up votes the Rogen's up there just

3849.32 --> 3856.52
undone afterward like you're all voting

3854.18 --> 3861.85
now it's just like bleep no no you

3856.52 --> 3861.85
didn't you didn't do that anymore

3880.41 --> 3886.7999999999997
it is rigged it is it just makes you

3884.22 --> 3889.62
think like okay if this shot a [ __ ]

3886.8 --> 3892.1400000000003
happens with YouTube you know I think

3889.62 --> 3895.02
that in an age where this is like normal

3892.14 --> 3898.17
it's like so damaged that people don't

3895.02 --> 3903.06
even really think about it or talk about

3898.17 --> 3905.79
it too much anymore I'd say that it

3903.06 --> 3910.07
wouldn't be very safe either to have

3905.79 --> 3915.65
like an internet voting system perhaps

3910.07 --> 3920.31
if this sort of thing is just normalized

3915.65 --> 3924.2000000000003
you know like why is this sort of thing

3920.31 --> 3927.57
normalized in any sort of form ever why

3924.2 --> 3931.5
does anybody ever think it is a good

3927.57 --> 3934.65
idea to rake the way things look outside

3931.5 --> 3937.35
of honest things that are happening why

3934.65 --> 3940.17
would anybody think it's a good idea to

3937.35 --> 3943.41
just leave that around and not mention

3940.17 --> 3946.14
it in a world where that is normal that

3943.41 --> 3948.7799999999997
means that anything can be rigged if

3946.14 --> 3950.64
there is any sort of normalization of

3948.78 --> 3953.07
things being rigged and people just go

3950.64 --> 3957.5099999999998
along with it that means that everything

3953.07 --> 3961.98
can then be raked karmically so if you

3957.51 --> 3964.98
allow one Rick you allow all of it once

3961.98 --> 3967.38
you perceive it that is what you

3964.98 --> 3976.29
perceive it and you leave it everything

3967.38 --> 3979.94
can be really for you so I I guess

3976.29 --> 3983.4
that's why I keep on whining of holies

3979.94 --> 3989.19
even though nobody really cares it's

3983.4 --> 3991.56
just why is this allowed why is this

3989.19 --> 3994.4700000000003
just happening just like that and it's

3991.56 --> 3998.07
being left like this and there's nobody

3994.47 --> 4002.9599999999996
like who put these people in charge of

3998.07 --> 4006.9500000000003
the system who did that why are they're

4002.96 --> 4010.66
blatantly politically corrupted people

4006.95 --> 4014.24
in control of rigging the appearance of

4010.66 --> 4017.6
public voting on an open-plan

4014.24 --> 4023.1189999999997
form why is this happening why is this

4017.6 --> 4026.6
tolerated and I'm asking human human

4023.119 --> 4029.33
beings not Satan not spirit not some

4026.6 --> 4033.6189999999997
external ization no human beings good

4029.33 --> 4037.39
servant human beings that log into

4033.619 --> 4048.32
computers and do this [ __ ] why is that

4037.39 --> 4052.31
being allowed why is this normalized why

4048.32 --> 4056.84
aren't at this point even like just FBI

4052.31 --> 4059.6
or whatever some organization put police

4056.84 --> 4062.57
group secret service just diving onto

4059.6 --> 4067.3399999999997
this company and just breaking these

4062.57 --> 4070.61
maniacs out just like no you're under

4067.34 --> 4073.19
arrest for all kinds of reasons

4070.61 --> 4076.61
political machinations the manipulations

4073.19 --> 4082.79
contributions to covering up criminal

4076.61 --> 4088.76
facts all so much that could be done

4082.79 --> 4092.0
technically why is all of this rigged

4088.76 --> 4096.109
[ __ ] just allowed to transpire just like

4092.0 --> 4100.58
that on a massive massive platform that

4096.109 --> 4106.6
reaches the entire world and it's just

4100.58 --> 4106.6
left like that it's just love

4128.069 --> 4135.63
right so I keep on whining about it I've

4132.909 --> 4138.579
probably been whining about votes and

4135.63 --> 4142.929
about manipulations of the stats and

4138.579 --> 4146.0689999999995
even bell notifications and just whining

4142.929 --> 4149.4400000000005
and whining like a stupid annoying

4146.069 --> 4151.299
person constantly whining about the

4149.44 --> 4153.699
thing that is engaging and even kind of

4151.299 --> 4157.269
making money off doing things with how

4153.699 --> 4159.159
it's just broken and how there is just

4157.269 --> 4164.639
evil [ __ ]

4159.159 --> 4168.879999999999
like evil blatantly evil [ __ ] happening

4164.639 --> 4172.179
and nothing is done about even though

4168.88 --> 4174.789
it's I'm talking about it pointing it

4172.179 --> 4177.819
out specifically time after time after

4174.789 --> 4181.299
time after time and nothing is done it's

4177.819 --> 4183.099
just no yeah yeah that happens there's

4181.299 --> 4185.549
nothing is going to be done it's it's

4183.099 --> 4187.929
just gonna be left like that it's okay

4185.549 --> 4193.479
because it's normal now it's normal

4187.929 --> 4196.11
lying and deceiving people about what

4193.479 --> 4198.76
the rest what the general public

4196.11 --> 4203.17
supposedly thinks about things is normal

4198.76 --> 4205.959
now lies are the new normal so yeah

4203.17 --> 4211.679
nobody is gonna do anything about it's

4205.959 --> 4214.57
just gonna be left like that right and

4211.679 --> 4217.719
then every time I think about that

4214.57 --> 4222.09
that's when I get the Rambo last blood

4217.719 --> 4226.57
type of response inside of me it's like

4222.09 --> 4228.849
all right it's just being left like that

4226.57 --> 4232.829
and everybody is just handing in their

4228.849 --> 4236.019
souls to let atrocious [ __ ] happen and

4232.829 --> 4242.11
then I'm wondering at what point am I

4236.019 --> 4244.179
gonna snap and just gonna say okay I

4242.11 --> 4247.36
don't really care anymore what happens

4244.179 --> 4251.469
now I'm just gonna make these people

4247.36 --> 4255.249
suffer more than they ever thought they

4251.469 --> 4256.81
could in some way and not not talking

4255.249 --> 4259.36
about bothering them

4256.81 --> 4263.080000000001
chats as to getting words to proofread

4259.36 --> 4267.009999999999
approved no no no no no much more

4263.08 --> 4269.83
nefarious type [ __ ] but I'm not going to

4267.01 --> 4272.650000000001
do that so easily though because I have

4269.83 --> 4278.1
been through pretty dis yeah

4272.65 --> 4280.9
just brutal psychological torture and I

4278.1 --> 4283.870000000001
know what's in the balance here what I'm

4280.9 --> 4286.66
also upholding in the journey and not

4283.87 --> 4288.34
gonna just throw that to the side just

4286.66 --> 4290.47
like that because there's a lot of

4288.34 --> 4296.5
people actually kind of depending on it

4290.47 --> 4298.650000000001
in ways that I don't even understand but

4296.5 --> 4309.49
it's certainly staring me in the face

4298.65 --> 4311.74
over a distance it's like yeah I'm done

4309.49 --> 4313.9
with these demons I'm done with people

4311.74 --> 4321.639999999999
having demonic behavior and getting away

4313.9 --> 4330.46
with it I'm done with it it's time for a

4321.64 --> 4332.4400000000005
big big sacrifice people huge

4330.46 --> 4338.32
preponderance of people that have let

4332.44 --> 4341.849999999999
themself degrade without any double yeah

4338.32 --> 4345.73
with without any reconsideration into

4341.85 --> 4353.1
absolute abject demonic gobbling

4345.73 --> 4353.099999999999
creatures and this this can't continue

4353.75 --> 4364.77
these people can't be left to keep on

4357.18 --> 4367.530000000001
ruining everything ruin everything and

4364.77 --> 4371.21
not just ruining things in secret but

4367.53 --> 4374.67
just ruining it openly in the face of

4371.21 --> 4377.07
everyone and everything and demoralizing

4374.67 --> 4381.36
people more so that anybody that can

4377.07 --> 4384.87
even see that it is a problem just it

4381.36 --> 4387.69
kills them slowly until they kind of try

4384.87 --> 4389.64
to jab their own spiritual eyes outs

4387.69 --> 4393.03
just so they don't have to feel the pain

4389.64 --> 4396.87
from seeing it anymore so how long is it

4393.03 --> 4403.82
going to take before these [ __ ] demon

4396.87 --> 4403.82
goblin people are taken to the slaughter

4404.96 --> 4415.7
because this [ __ ] can't continue for

4410.01 --> 4415.7
much longer just can't

4418.099 --> 4426.67
the backlash from letting all this [ __ ]

4421.34 --> 4426.67
just continue is just gonna be so absurd

4428.77 --> 4436.639
that all these ideas of what we think

4433.67 --> 4440.51
now is supposedly so good about the

4436.639 --> 4443.78
world and anything it's all that's just

4440.51 --> 4448.369000000001
gonna be forgotten it's gonna be erased

4443.78 --> 4450.98
like it never existed how are you gonna

4448.369 --> 4455.36
rebuild Society in a world where nobody

4450.98 --> 4457.879999999999
can even remember what it is like to

4455.36 --> 4461.329
have a genuine spirit and to do good

4457.88 --> 4466.099
things for for one another and to make

4461.329 --> 4468.11
effort for people you love and how is

4466.099 --> 4471.07
that gonna rebuild after a certain point

4468.11 --> 4474.71
it's not it's just gonna be people

4471.07 --> 4478.28
waiting in a pack or their minds ready

4474.71 --> 4480.53
to kill somebody else until everything

4478.28 --> 4483.259999999999
is all dead and the last remaining

4480.53 --> 4486.5
people just literally die of loneliness

4483.26 --> 4493.25
and suicide right so how long is it

4486.5 --> 4498.38
gonna take before before this switch

4493.25 --> 4500.119
happens effectively and nobody can step

4498.38 --> 4504.31
away from that when that huh when

4500.119 --> 4504.3099999999995
that'll happen nobody

4510.999 --> 4518.94
how long are people just gonna be

4513.34 --> 4522.13
allowed to spiral into demonic behavior

4518.94 --> 4530.129999999999
without regrets without any sign of

4522.13 --> 4530.13
retreat and literally get away with it

4532.199 --> 4536.94
how long is this going to continue

4534.19 --> 4536.94
people

4550.349 --> 4555.269
because I don't know at this point if

4553.649 --> 4557.309
I'd see somebody diss

4555.269 --> 4560.280000000001
acting like a complete disgusting

4557.309 --> 4562.859
miserable bastard and somebody else just

4560.28 --> 4565.1089999999995
goes nuts and put punches him in the

4562.859 --> 4570.689
face like kicks the [ __ ] out of him I

4565.109 --> 4575.76
would be [ __ ] clapping yeah [ __ ] him

4570.689 --> 4578.479
up that's what I do now because I'm that

4575.76 --> 4582.659000000001
[ __ ] pissed off it's just anyone that

4578.479 --> 4587.159000000001
behaves like a [ __ ] demon needs to be

4582.659 --> 4591.179
kicked the [ __ ] out of just on the spot

4587.159 --> 4595.049999999999
like a visceral response reflex just

4591.179 --> 4599.4890000000005
[ __ ] them up it's not a good mindset is

4595.05 --> 4601.349
it but thank God I don't get confronted

4599.489 --> 4606.209
with a lot of this kind of stuff people

4601.349 --> 4607.8
do I guess kind of feel it maybe because

4606.209 --> 4611.669
people don't really misbehave in my

4607.8 --> 4625.26
presence it's very wise of them very

4611.669 --> 4631.229
very wise keep it up all right so yeah

4625.26 --> 4635.539000000001
maybe that is all a little nutty but I'm

4631.229 --> 4639.389
just so [ __ ] sick of demonic wretched

4635.539 --> 4644.579
disgusting cowardly behavior I'm done

4639.389 --> 4647.3
with it I'm just done with it it's a

4644.579 --> 4652.499
contract breaker for me

4647.3 --> 4656.639
breaks the contract civil contract it's

4652.499 --> 4660.179
just like no that is that breaks the law

4656.639 --> 4662.84
it breaks the law the real law the

4660.179 --> 4662.84
natural law

4667.76 --> 4690.469
and it demands a visceral response so

4679.08 --> 4690.469
yeah stop taking [ __ ] stop taking it so

4691.07 --> 4699.78
don't forget to breathe no don't go

4696.56 --> 4701.52
looking for an excuse to start pounding

4699.78 --> 4703.71
on somebody okay that's not what I'm

4701.52 --> 4711.6
saying at all it's just that in the

4703.71 --> 4714.389
moment especially it's don't look for

4711.6 --> 4716.969
trouble don't worry it'll find you and

4714.389 --> 4721.08
then it'll test you that's pretty much

4716.969 --> 4728.46
it and demonic this disgusting behavior

4721.08 --> 4729.65
requires a visceral response it's just

4728.46 --> 4732.929
how it is

4729.65 --> 4735.509999999999
don't be ashamed don't be afraid you

4732.929 --> 4742.2300000000005
know what it's gonna happen once you

4735.51 --> 4744.63
start punching somebody in the face yeah

4742.23 --> 4746.5199999999995
it's gonna look ugly it is it's gonna

4744.63 --> 4750.27
look very [ __ ] ugly because they are

4746.52 --> 4753.389
weak freaks they are mentally ill you

4750.27 --> 4755.31
need to smack him in the face and then

4753.389 --> 4758.34
it's gonna be oh my god you were sold to

4755.31 --> 4761.280000000001
Dead Eye and then you're probably gonna

4758.34 --> 4763.05
bear to get into a bad light little but

4761.28 --> 4766.889
you gotta tell it like it is and just

4763.05 --> 4770.76
say no he was absolutely miserable and

4766.889 --> 4774.96
he tried to psychologically attack me

4770.76 --> 4779.6
and hurt me try to use my moral nature

4774.96 --> 4782.6
against me and he needed to be punished

4779.6 --> 4782.6
publicly

4784.409 --> 4789.9
that's what I kind of want to see it's I

4786.659 --> 4794.429
don't know if this is a good thing to

4789.9 --> 4796.92
wish for I'm just done with this [ __ ]

4794.429 --> 4800.75
demonic behavior from people I'm done

4796.92 --> 4800.75
with it no more

4827.42 --> 4831.58
wait are you talking to me good servant

4837.97 --> 4845.320000000001
moving out here well this is yeah

4843.34 --> 4852.33
Utrecht you know it is kind of peaceful

4845.32 --> 4852.33
I guess but it's like extremely liberal

4853.5 --> 4860.29
it's like seriously like oh everyone

4858.34 --> 4862.96
under 30 is low most like social justice

4860.29 --> 4866.14
warrior in one way it's like all the men

4862.96 --> 4867.82
have all been turned gay even if they're

4866.14 --> 4870.88
not gay they're acting like they're gay

4867.82 --> 4873.16
or something everyone that has a

4870.88 --> 4875.11
relationship that is heterosexual is

4873.16 --> 4879.37
always the man looks like a freaking

4875.11 --> 4883.48
man-child with stupid [ __ ] looking

4879.37 --> 4888.16
clothes on and some goofy face and woman

4883.48 --> 4891.82
always looks like super like gamma and

4888.16 --> 4897.04
just paranoid and every freaking blue or

4891.82 --> 4898.929999999999
purple green hair whatever it it's it's

4897.04 --> 4902.34
a lot of that hair so I wouldn't

4898.93 --> 4905.860000000001
recommend it if you're used to America

4902.34 --> 4907.72
then yeah if you're like from a liberal

4905.86 --> 4909.969999999999
city it's not going to be very different

4907.72 --> 4914.740000000001
except that it is a lot more peaceful

4909.97 --> 4918.06
here but I don't know if you're used to

4914.74 --> 4922.48
the outer outer country or a freedom

4918.06 --> 4924.84
situation oh I'd prefer that to be

4922.48 --> 4924.839999999999
honest

4932.469 --> 4940.329
it's true death of Colette it's like

4935.199 --> 4944.71
every guy here feels compelled to

4940.329 --> 4959.768999999999
pretend like they're [ __ ] gay it is

4944.71 --> 4961.51
true that's and men don't they don't

4959.769 --> 4963.76
even know what to do anymore

4961.51 --> 4966.280000000001
and then there's there's some opposition

4963.76 --> 4969.820000000001
on the finds guys there's some like guys

4966.28 --> 4971.969
out there that are like I'm a man and

4969.82 --> 4974.949
like [ __ ] that but they're like

4971.969 --> 4980.4890000000005
overreacting to the other side as well

4974.949 --> 4987.308999999999
you know it's like the entire social

4980.489 --> 4990.339999999999
conduct of what people act like has just

4987.309 --> 4992.860000000001
been severely assaulted from all

4990.34 --> 4996.159000000001
directions from school from family

4992.86 --> 4998.32
through the TV and all that and it's

4996.159 --> 5000.869
just it's almost like it's completely

4998.32 --> 5007.19
forgotten what it is like to be a normal

5000.869 --> 5007.19
human being naturally it's crazy

5037.49 --> 5040.51
[Music]

5045.44 --> 5051.33
right on the other hand though I have to

5048.33 --> 5053.219
also mention to balance it out because

5051.33 --> 5055.44
yeah there are laws so should justice

5053.219 --> 5059.82
look like types that kind of [ __ ]

5055.44 --> 5064.62
especially below 30 but I'm also still

5059.82 --> 5068.3099999999995
seeing plenty of just families guess my

5064.62 --> 5070.98
age and older just families that look

5068.31 --> 5073.9490000000005
like they're crushing it with a man that

5070.98 --> 5076.259999999999
actually looks like a man that has the

5073.949 --> 5078.299999999999
energy radiance of an actual man with

5076.26 --> 5080.969
actual responsibilities and all that and

5078.3 --> 5083.79
a woman that actually looks like a woman

5080.969 --> 5087.21
and kids that just look like kids trying

5083.79 --> 5090.96
to be kids so there's it's not like

5087.21 --> 5096.179
everything is completely fruity here but

5090.96 --> 5100.9800000000005
a big part is but not everything sinner

5096.179 --> 5103.429
thank God or that be nothing left in a

5100.98 --> 5103.428999999999
generation

5110.42 --> 5115.85
can you please stop attacking each other

5143.88 --> 5151.78
the charts Sanford who else is gonna

5146.71 --> 5155.7390000000005
write it are is man not the only thing

5151.78 --> 5158.98
that even can do writing so who else is

5155.739 --> 5162.79
gonna write it though it's the book is

5158.98 --> 5165.459999999999
not about who made it or even the

5162.79 --> 5168.01
details it contains no it's about the

5165.46 --> 5170.68
story what it stands for and the

5168.01 --> 5176.05
frequency of it the perfection in

5170.68 --> 5181.12
between the technicals it is this that

5176.05 --> 5185.38
is it it doesn't matter it's written by

5181.12 --> 5188.65
man it doesn't matter it's being kept by

5185.38 --> 5191.11
like the primary evil organization that

5188.65 --> 5195.639999999999
opposes the very core of it

5191.11 --> 5198.19
fundamentally forever like for hundreds

5195.64 --> 5200.62
of years the Catholic Church is it is

5198.19 --> 5203.349999999999
like the Church of Satan really in a

5200.62 --> 5206.17
technical sense it's just so convoluted

5203.35 --> 5207.910000000001
and complex now it leads you know

5206.17 --> 5211.42
Catholics are not Satanists I'm not

5207.91 --> 5213.94
saying that it's just that the church

5211.42 --> 5218.41
it's not supposed to be there according

5213.94 --> 5221.949
to Christ it's so ironic but besides all

5218.41 --> 5226.0
that that doesn't matter none of it

5221.949 --> 5228.16
matters doesn't matter it's written by

5226.0 --> 5229.18
men it doesn't matter it's being kept by

5228.16 --> 5231.88
evil wizards

5229.18 --> 5234.31
it doesn't matter doesn't even matter

5231.88 --> 5236.29
that the weird things are being added on

5234.31 --> 5237.910000000001
they're changed or left out it nothing

5236.29 --> 5241.03
about that matters the only thing that

5237.91 --> 5246.88
matters is what it really is is what the

5241.03 --> 5251.199
story is the story the deeper meaning

5246.88 --> 5253.2300000000005
the deeper insights that is what it is

5251.199 --> 5256.21
and it doesn't matter how it is

5253.23 --> 5260.83
manifested it is what it is and that is

5256.21 --> 5263.68
it and you can't really distort it

5260.83 --> 5267.91
because if you really distort it then it

5263.68 --> 5271.21
just loses everything then it becomes a

5267.91 --> 5274.42
skeleton like a fake and obviously fake

5271.21 --> 5276.13
feeling religion because the essence

5274.42 --> 5278.26
that really gives it its

5276.13 --> 5279.909000000001
real power and that's been encapsulated

5278.26 --> 5282.219
by the churching system in the exoteric

5279.909 --> 5285.549999999999
sand all that's been encapsulated Christ

5282.219 --> 5288.04
energy if you distort that Christ

5285.55 --> 5292.08
structure energy it doesn't work anymore

5288.04 --> 5292.08
and that's the whole freaking trick

5292.98 --> 5299.08
that's why they have to keep it the way

5296.409 --> 5300.12
it is because otherwise it doesn't work

5299.08 --> 5303.639
anymore

5300.12 --> 5307.23
you get it doesn't matter it's written

5303.639 --> 5310.929
by man it doesn't matter it's being kept

5307.23 --> 5316.5599999999995
by freaking evil wizards it does not

5310.929 --> 5316.56
matter are you getting this yet

5320.18 --> 5323.2390000000005
[Music]

5347.989 --> 5361.79
something that matters is what it is not

5352.55 --> 5364.28
who's in control because the control can

5361.79 --> 5366.89
only stay the control as long as the

5364.28 --> 5369.11
power is not damaged by that control so

5366.89 --> 5371.6900000000005
the control can never really damage the

5369.11 --> 5374.0
power they can only cover it up with

5371.69 --> 5378.129999999999
exoteric nonsense to distract people

5374.0 --> 5378.13
from the essence of the power

5379.84 --> 5382.879
[Music]

5401.91 --> 5405.75
splashing it all over the place

5406.54 --> 5409.67
[Music]

5432.76 --> 5435.4800000000005
hmm

5439.49 --> 5444.07
yeah it is interesting good servant but

5444.25 --> 5449.42
yeah you know there's so much exoteric

5448.15 --> 5451.91
stuff

5449.42 --> 5453.62
concerning the Bible in so many ways and

5451.91 --> 5456.05
that don't even blame it you know on the

5453.62 --> 5457.13
people that deal in that for example

5456.05 --> 5461.27
Bible literalist

5457.13 --> 5463.9400000000005
is really she really delves into all of

5461.27 --> 5468.13
it every extrapolation everything that

5463.94 --> 5468.129999999999
was done every way you could look at it

5468.46 --> 5475.19
but it is mostly exit Eric's because all

5472.7 --> 5481.929999999999
of that is all like on the sidelines of

5475.19 --> 5481.929999999999
the core essence the true what it is

5501.15 --> 5505.49
what kind of ridiculous question is that

5521.739 --> 5524.4
what

5527.19 --> 5533.96
what are you talking about Photoshop I

5530.07 --> 5533.96
don't get where you're going with this

5578.23 --> 5590.509999999999
okay Photoshop so I don't know what

5584.12 --> 5592.79
you're talking about but I think it's

5590.51 --> 5595.820000000001
safe to say that in the ancient past

5592.79 --> 5596.6
before we all got inducted with physical

5595.82 --> 5600.32
literalism

5596.6 --> 5602.51
and physically the assumption bias

5600.32 --> 5604.46
nonsense about the heavens that it was

5602.51 --> 5607.16
pretty well established what the Sun and

5604.46 --> 5610.04
Moon even were what the lights of it are

5607.16 --> 5612.8
and how strong it is of course because

5610.04 --> 5615.68
chemical interaction with light of

5612.8 --> 5619.39
course it existed before like the 20th

5615.68 --> 5622.400000000001
century it's like chemical photo

5619.39 --> 5626.0
photochemical reactions have yea existed

5622.4 --> 5628.87
as long as material exists so of course

5626.0 --> 5635.45
in the past they could figure out how

5628.87 --> 5637.97
what it was this conception that only

5635.45 --> 5640.01
now because of our modern technology can

5637.97 --> 5643.610000000001
we figure it all out that's all nonsense

5640.01 --> 5646.31
it's all Luciferian arrogance based on

5643.61 --> 5649.94
the presupposition that everyone was

5646.31 --> 5652.31
[ __ ] before the modern atheist

5649.94 --> 5654.94
civilization came into being it's all

5652.31 --> 5654.9400000000005
[ __ ]

5671.26 --> 5685.780000000001
okay Africa if you say so I don't know

5676.36 --> 5685.78
could be a Jewish after a whole demeanor

5705.57 --> 5715.15
yeah hey Acharya not in bail here

5711.66 --> 5718.63
so the the 5k prepared at all and I

5715.15 --> 5721.95
thought in the data stop this club that

5718.63 --> 5724.95
the mere alternative news on the

5721.95 --> 5724.95
gearshift

5733.639 --> 5744.2300000000005
this yeah yeah brilliance I was kind of

5741.469 --> 5747.44
just about to round out to show and you

5744.23 --> 5756.619
just woke up of course she did that late

5747.44 --> 5758.75
night I take it all right yeah I was

5756.619 --> 5761.42
just asking geo shifter about if he's

5758.75 --> 5764.239
heard anything about the attempt at a

5761.42 --> 5767.119
rollout for 5g in Belgium and that they

5764.239 --> 5771.709999999999
I heard that it was being stopped in its

5767.119 --> 5774.71
tracks it's five Proximus 5g he is up

5771.71 --> 5779.51
and running yeah so it's not being

5774.71 --> 5782.2300000000005
holiday because that's what I read it's

5779.51 --> 5782.2300000000005
disgusting

5795.09 --> 5806.74
let me see if I can [ __ ] ya here I got

5802.84 --> 5811.39
it from the bristles times I've no idea

5806.74 --> 5814.74
I'm gonna post it in chat oh it is

5811.39 --> 5814.740000000001

5830.88 --> 5841.59
here again like I'm gonna [ __ ] Towers

5836.13 --> 5843.389
I hate that [ __ ] like who needs it

nobody here needs it

5843.389 --> 5853.650000000001
nobody like it is it's just an attack I

5850.94 --> 5857.73
don't care if people think that's fear

5853.65 --> 5859.739
porn or improving nonsense because I I'm

5857.73 --> 5862.379999999999
not a doctor and I haven't had a

5859.739 --> 5865.98
presentation for like two hours based on

5862.38 --> 5869.34
30 dedicated life years of study on that

5865.98 --> 5871.259999999999
[ __ ] in person I'm sorry I've seen

5869.34 --> 5880.59
enough to know what I'm [ __ ] talk

5871.26 --> 5883.320000000001
about oh the French part of the country

5880.59 --> 5886.76
is pushing back of course they are of

5883.32 --> 5889.929999999999
course they are

5886.76 --> 5889.93
[Music]

5892.75 --> 5903.9
because the French yeah I don't know

5899.62 --> 5907.09
what it is about them but it's just that

5903.9 --> 5910.15
on one hand you got like the French

5907.09 --> 5912.43
farmers and they're pretty kick-ass but

5910.15 --> 5915.2699999999995
then you got like the non farmers and

5912.43 --> 5919.530000000001
they are among some of the most

5915.27 --> 5924.540000000001
disgusting [ __ ] you can imagine

5919.53 --> 5927.37
sometimes sometimes it's just that

5924.54 --> 5930.88
sometimes these situations with French

5927.37 --> 5941.89
and I just see that and just like gotta

5930.88 --> 5945.28
strangle myself so I guess that I guess

5941.89 --> 5946.660000000001
that the Dutch speaking Belgium people

5945.28 --> 5949.15
just couldn't do it

5946.66 --> 5951.13
they the Dutch parrot the spirit did not

5949.15 --> 5955.2
allow them to [ __ ] through that [ __ ]

5951.13 --> 5955.2
again good

5970.9 --> 5979.12
come on Amanda you I'm not just just

5973.51 --> 5981.610000000001
gonna speak touch just like that I'll

5979.12 --> 5984.34
I'll do a Dutch conversation with

5981.61 --> 5989.92
somebody I do I'll even do it on camera

5984.34 --> 5991.99
you know I really wonder why not more

5989.92 --> 5994.96
Dutch people have come to me like hey

5991.99 --> 6000.21
you wanna get on this do this interview

5994.96 --> 6001.14
I really wonder why am i dad that much

6000.21 --> 6004.62
of a weirdo

6001.14 --> 6007.47
I don't think so maybe I'm not weirdo

6004.62 --> 6013.7699999999995
enough or something maybe that [ __ ] I

6007.47 --> 6016.56
don't know what it is it's either I'm

6013.77 --> 6020.150000000001
too much of a weirdo or I'm not weirdo

6016.56 --> 6023.1
enough for them I don't know what it is

6020.15 --> 6027.33
or maybe everybody's like Nana just

6023.1 --> 6031.59
leave that guy alone I I'm ready for

6027.33 --> 6034.26
that I'll do it I'm up you can call me

6031.59 --> 6038.45

and you know who you are out there and

6041.12 --> 6048.18
then you can [ __ ] off but if you're

6044.64 --> 6051.38

6048.18 --> 6054.89
person my knowledge my cosmogony

6051.38 --> 6059.16
my vision stuff whatever spiritual stuff

6054.89 --> 6063.030000000001
yeah I'm here I'm open for conversation

6059.16 --> 6072.09
alive I do it live all of it all of it

6063.03 --> 6076.349999999999
always and I can I'm trained so yeah I'm

6072.09 --> 6079.59

6076.35 --> 6083.97
behind YouTube behind my computer ready

6079.59 --> 6087.21
and available so contact me I'm serious

6083.97 --> 6090.66
like why why is this not happening I'm

6087.21 --> 6094.68
not sure but I'm ready and available I'm

6090.66 --> 6098.73
up for business media business wild

6094.68 --> 6100.83
stories if you like him i limited

6098.73 --> 6103.86
cooperation when it concerns like

6100.83 --> 6104.699
narrowing down a narrative limited but

6103.86 --> 6107.339999999999
not entire

6104.699 --> 6109.678999999999
without I get it some people just can't

6107.34 --> 6115.709
take certain types of [ __ ] I know I

6109.679 --> 6117.84
could do it I'm right here and I can do

6115.709 --> 6119.28
it in Dutch just as well as I can in

6117.84 --> 6121.59
English although I'll probably be better

6119.28 --> 6124.4
at it in English because I'm just so

6121.59 --> 6124.400000000001
used to doing that

6132.469 --> 6136.37
I'm not gonna do it in French

6136.53 --> 6145.38
I can only speak very annoying fake

6141.09 --> 6150.6
French accents and that is but half ever

6145.38 --> 6154.26
goes because I can't I really can't

6150.6 --> 6156.9890000000005
speak French I just can maybe because

6154.26 --> 6173.909000000001
it's I don't want to but I just can't I

6156.989 --> 6176.339999999999
can't do it come on Amanda you what do

6173.909 --> 6178.349999999999
you want me to say in Dutch maybe

6176.34 --> 6183.57
somebody has a back-and-forth with me in

6178.35 --> 6185.52
Dutch it's just like you know well how

6183.57 --> 6187.469
would it make you feel if you went to

6185.52 --> 6189.51
some other country and they just like ha

6187.469 --> 6193.2300000000005
ha ha you speak English

6189.51 --> 6196.400000000001
it sounds so funny you know that feels

6193.23 --> 6196.4
kind of weird too right

6205.44 --> 6211.87
does everybody speak English in Europe

6208.03 --> 6215.5599999999995
no no they don't but it is among the

6211.87 --> 6221.89
more common tongues that you could more

6215.56 --> 6224.35
likely speak but it depends especially

6221.89 --> 6224.950000000001
in West Europe what were English as more

6224.35 --> 6227.59
rich

6224.95 --> 6231.849999999999
you know everybody pretty much can speak

6227.59 --> 6234.1900000000005
English but say more in Eastern Europe

6231.85 --> 6235.81
there's less likelihood that they can't

6234.19 --> 6237.73
speak English or if they do that it's

6235.81 --> 6239.410000000001
going to be choppy because they are more

6237.73 --> 6244.98
inclined to learn the language of their

6239.41 --> 6249.849999999999
neighbors instead just is that way

6244.98 --> 6253.209999999999

Zota zelma New Zealand's Incan got it

6263.47 --> 6271.780000000001
right in one go and the Belgium accent

6265.63 --> 6273.76
how about that because you you can only

6271.78 --> 6275.469999999999
say that in the Belgium accent that's

6273.76 --> 6278.05
never gonna work he was saying Dutch is

6275.47 --> 6279.16
terrible that's that's literally gonna

6278.05 --> 6283.84

6298.14 --> 6305.89
okay wasn't as bad as you thought so

6304.03 --> 6313.5599999999995
yeah people that was the difference

6305.89 --> 6313.56
between Belgium and Dutch Dutch sort of

6315.459 --> 6322.209
there's a lot more roundings to the

6319.129 --> 6328.3589999999995
Belgium not just much more straight

6322.209 --> 6328.3589999999995
Marcia straightforward like that Wow

6330.399 --> 6337.780000000001
okey-dokey you are it's it's just the

6335.3 --> 6337.78
language

6357.05 --> 6373.83
yeah I like to hear different languages

6368.57 --> 6378.0
right well me too in a way for example I

6373.83 --> 6380.7
can appreciate Spanish like I appreciate

6378.0 --> 6385.05
the language and it's interesting to me

6380.7 --> 6388.8
because I with the Mediterranean like I

6385.05 --> 6391.29
can hear the differences and it feels

6388.8 --> 6392.91
it's like I have a feel for languages

6391.29 --> 6396.12
you know I don't always exactly know

6392.91 --> 6401.58
what they're talking about but I tend to

6396.12 --> 6403.53
catch on to it quickly but what I notice

6401.58 --> 6405.84
is like the difference in dialects and

6403.53 --> 6407.929999999999
all that I noticed that even early on

6405.84 --> 6411.51
it's just like the difference between

6407.93 --> 6414.21
Italian and Spanish and Spanish and

6411.51 --> 6417.6900000000005
Portuguese and it's like yeah it is

6414.21 --> 6420.3
really a migration just a shift just

6417.69 --> 6423.75
like Dutch in a way is a shift from

6420.3 --> 6425.76
German and also there is kind of a shift

6423.75 --> 6427.62
into English because there is

6425.76 --> 6429.99
similarities between Dutch and English

6427.62 --> 6433.349999999999
although the difference are much more

6429.99 --> 6436.92
harsh the connections are definitely

6433.35 --> 6439.26
noticeably and trace ibly there so I

6436.92 --> 6442.05
always find that interesting just how

6439.26 --> 6444.42
you can feel that certain type of

6442.05 --> 6447.59
languages are neighboring to one another

6444.42 --> 6447.59
I find that very fascinating

6456.92 --> 6462.39
[Music]

6459.39 --> 6462.39
hmm

6468.06 --> 6473.04
I speak English but sometimes I don't

6471.09 --> 6477.84
understand what Nathan Oakley is saying

6473.04 --> 6481.98
really good servant he he really does

6477.84 --> 6484.53
his best to speak Oxford quality English

6481.98 --> 6489.54
as much as he can pulls in like the

6484.53 --> 6493.2
really detailed refined words it's it's

6489.54 --> 6496.74
tough to do that you know you can if you

6493.2 --> 6500.91
want speak English with a very detailed

6496.74 --> 6503.3099999999995
white palate of meaning like English was

6500.91 --> 6508.22
designed to be able to be wielded by

6503.31 --> 6511.830000000001
somebody that has a big language mind

6508.22 --> 6515.04
that's what English was designed for and

6511.83 --> 6520.38
probably designed by now by people that

6515.04 --> 6522.45
really can wield language language mages

6520.38 --> 6525.0
you could say I was and that's what

6522.45 --> 6528.8099999999995
English was designed for now you can be

6525.0 --> 6532.58
speak very basic English very stumbly

6528.81 --> 6535.830000000001
just get to the point type of English or

6532.58 --> 6540.03
commoners English and then you can speak

6535.83 --> 6543.87
more like city folk English and then you

6540.03 --> 6546.62
can speak really teacher level English

6543.87 --> 6552.45
and so there's all these different

6546.62 --> 6555.29
depths and reaches that are available in

6552.45 --> 6558.8099999999995
English for people to go towards like

6555.29 --> 6565.83
there's something up for grabs for

6558.81 --> 6569.01
anyone's lingo appetites in English it's

6565.83 --> 6572.2699999999995
extremely dynamic and can be dumb it can

6569.01 --> 6577.56
be extremely intellectual can be

6572.27 --> 6580.34
artistic it can be old-fashioned rigid

6577.56 --> 6580.34
it can be anything

6582.91 --> 6588.17
and it was designed to do that it was

6585.35 --> 6592.88
designed as a language to overspend the

6588.17 --> 6598.25
entire world and thus it had to have

6592.88 --> 6602.81
this diversity capability in it because

6598.25 --> 6608.48
if a language cannot it is not flexible

6602.81 --> 6611.4800000000005
enough with within its roots then if an

6608.48 --> 6617.839999999999
empire that wields that language reaches

6611.48 --> 6621.259999999999
to wide breaks apart instead of the

6617.84 --> 6622.22
regions of where that Empire adapting to

6621.26 --> 6623.99
the language

6622.22 --> 6626.150000000001
it'll happen the other way around the

6623.99 --> 6629.36
ones that have that language and can't

6626.15 --> 6631.5199999999995
adapt it properly they will adapt to

6629.36 --> 6633.95
their region and the effect of the

6631.52 --> 6637.910000000001
wielding the language for the empire is

6633.95 --> 6641.57
undone so I think if the English was

6637.91 --> 6645.11
designed like it is for the British

6641.57 --> 6649.04
Empire that's probably the reason it was

6645.11 --> 6651.86
made like that with that purpose in mind

6649.04 --> 6658.87
it was kind of a language to conquer the

6651.86 --> 6658.87
world really and in a way it has

6678.719 --> 6683.07
Spanish Spanish and Mexican is

6681.3 --> 6686.9400000000005
technically the same it's just that

6683.07 --> 6691.259999999999
Mexican tends to be more like a farmers

6686.94 --> 6693.679999999999
variety of Spanish it's kind of what it

6691.26 --> 6693.68
is really

6703.64 --> 6711.2300000000005
and I think there's also maybe some

6707.56 --> 6714.92
detail changes have to do with the the

6711.23 --> 6717.549999999999
local things in Mexico and like Indian

6714.92 --> 6720.29
traditions or whatever is left of that

6717.55 --> 6723.2300000000005
so some slight assimilation but it is

6720.29 --> 6725.47
basically like a farmers spanish if i'm

6723.23 --> 6725.469999999999
not mistaken

6734.91 --> 6742.26
the hick way of Spanish okay thanks I

6738.86 --> 6743.969999999999
did you don't have to say it like that

6742.26 --> 6748.320000000001
you know there's nothing wrong with

6743.97 --> 6749.9400000000005
farmer speak farmers are awesome there

6748.32 --> 6754.469999999999
they are they're the ones that keep the

6749.94 --> 6760.549999999999
world alive if they do it organically

6754.47 --> 6760.55
that is and with some respect for God

6782.65 --> 6787.2699999999995
right good service yeah a lot of tiny

6785.26 --> 6789.400000000001
little things that that's what I said

6787.27 --> 6793.900000000001
that is typically the adaptation to the

6789.4 --> 6796.48
local scenario you know language has

6793.9 --> 6799.78
roots the meaning roots and then

6796.48 --> 6802.389999999999
eventually it kind of settles in to

6799.78 --> 6806.44
where it is and those are like the edges

6802.39 --> 6810.64
of the leaf of it and those will have

6806.44 --> 6815.5599999999995
the more local adaptations the edge of

6810.64 --> 6817.96
the leaf of a language that is where it

6815.56 --> 6820.18
becomes apparent that it is a different

6817.96 --> 6822.7
region having the same language because

6820.18 --> 6825.31
that is where all the slight local

6822.7 --> 6828.82
adapting details are at the edge of the

6825.31 --> 6831.490000000001
leaf of the language the roots always

6828.82 --> 6834.179999999999
have to stay the same or it just becomes

6831.49 --> 6834.179999999999
a different language

6844.66 --> 6849.8099999999995
you speak Spanish cool I didn't know

6847.12 --> 6849.8099999999995
that Amanda you

6856.46 --> 6861.92
I used to learn a bit of Spanish when I

6859.64 --> 6866.54
was younger but then I just it slipped

6861.92 --> 6870.29
completely but I've learned to pronounce

6866.54 --> 6874.1
I can pronounce Spanish pretty correctly

6870.29 --> 6877.31
like a verbalist but I do it purely on

6874.1 --> 6880.06
phonetic basis right now because I kind

6877.31 --> 6882.830000000001
of lost the grip of just how it works

6880.06 --> 6885.14
but if somebody tell me something in

6882.83 --> 6886.55
Spanish and I'd hear it a couple of

6885.14 --> 6888.320000000001
times I would be able to just

6886.55 --> 6891.85
phonetically repeat it to perfection

6888.32 --> 6891.849999999999
absolutely I can

6900.81 --> 6905.09
yeah

6903.169 --> 6908.229
right anyway I'm gonna round out to show

6905.09 --> 6914.78
guys it's it's been a great two hours

6908.229 --> 6917.059
all over the place got very fired up put

6914.78 --> 6923.148999999999
out some I don't know if some dark

6917.059 --> 6928.969
predictions I guess all predictions more

6923.149 --> 6932.2390000000005
like just yeah angles to inevitability

6928.969 --> 6933.8
and all that and just like yeah I don't

6932.239 --> 6936.138999999999
know really know what to think about it

6933.8 --> 6938.659000000001
I hope you guys are not worried or

6936.139 --> 6943.659000000001
anything it's just that yeah everything

6938.659 --> 6948.138999999999
is gone is being pushed so bad and and

6943.659 --> 6950.419
just this demonic festering social

6948.139 --> 6954.409000000001
behavior from certain individuals that

6950.419 --> 6956.119
are not stopping it they it's not just a

6954.409 --> 6959.478999999999
thing they have to get out of their

6956.119 --> 6962.959
system no it's some people I just keep

6959.479 --> 6965.570000000001
on doing it it it becomes them they made

6962.959 --> 6968.36
a mistake they didn't learn from their

6965.57 --> 6970.929
mistake and then they became the mistake

6968.36 --> 6974.86
and that's really what's going on and

6970.929 --> 6980.9490000000005
something's got to be done about this

6974.86 --> 6986.148999999999
effectively not just some some yeah

6980.949 --> 6989.329
superficial nonsense that's good yes

6986.149 --> 6993.38
stand is gotta be made to stop them in a

6989.329 --> 6996.169
way for real without the controllers

6993.38 --> 6997.969
doing it for us and taking everybody

6996.169 --> 7000.669
else that opposes them in any way with

6997.969 --> 7005.32
them because they will try guaranteed

7000.669 --> 7007.84
100% guarantee they will try but just

7005.32 --> 7010.63
because they could and we'll try it does

7007.84 --> 7013.84
not mean that nothing must be done about

7010.63 --> 7015.909000000001
this situation it's just we shouldn't do

7013.84 --> 7018.999
it in the way that they're gonna

7015.909 --> 7021.28
basically seemingly gonna try to make it

7018.999 --> 7023.409
very easy for us to do it if we just do

7021.28 --> 7025.09
what they say that's not gonna be the

7023.409 --> 7028.449
way it's gonna happen that's the way

7025.09 --> 7032.53
we're gonna be tricked but something has

7028.449 --> 7035.549999999999
got to be done about the demonic goblin

7032.53 --> 7040.16
behavioral plague

7035.55 --> 7043.820000000001
is festering in the Western social world

7040.16 --> 7050.16
something's got to be done and

7043.82 --> 7052.41
censorship safe spaces that's not the

7050.16 --> 7056.91

7052.41 --> 7059.76
