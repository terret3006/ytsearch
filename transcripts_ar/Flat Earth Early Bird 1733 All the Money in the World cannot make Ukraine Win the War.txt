[Music]

61.399 --> 66.619
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

64.979 --> 70.439
bird number

66.619 --> 72.119
1733 I'm your host Darwin and before I

70.439 --> 74.63999999999999
start the show please don't forget to

72.119 --> 77.58
share it on any platform you didn't fit

74.64 --> 80.1
and if you haven't already subscribe to

77.58 --> 82.2
my channel hit the Bell notification so

80.1 --> 84.83999999999999
you know when I'm going live which is

82.2 --> 87.36
normally 1pm Amsterdam time weekdays and

84.84 --> 89.759
2PM Amsterdam time in the weekend and

87.36 --> 91.979
please also do support me through the

89.759 --> 93.84
PayPal and the patreon that will be much

91.979 --> 94.979
appreciated and you can always use the

93.84 --> 98.10000000000001
support

94.979 --> 100.5
so yeah somebody donated yesterday and

98.1 --> 102.96
that's why I'm doing a show today

100.5 --> 104.47
so please keep it coming

102.96 --> 106.32
right

104.47 --> 109.14
[Music]

106.32 --> 111.67999999999999
weather today is a little bit more

109.14 --> 111.68
cloudy

112.439 --> 116.53999999999999
it was kind of nice yesterday

116.82 --> 120.65899999999999
even like the evening was pretty clear

119.04 --> 123.659
skied

120.659 --> 126.18
yeah but today it's not

123.659 --> 129.42000000000002
it's so

126.18 --> 130.86
clouded and a bit windy and it's

129.42 --> 133.14
probably a little cooler than yesterday

130.86 --> 135.59900000000002
not too much though

133.14 --> 139.98
I'm still sitting here in my shirt

135.599 --> 144.2
mint plant is still just doing great

139.98 --> 144.2
look at how much that thing is bushy now

145.94 --> 149.06
all right

150.91 --> 154.02
[Music]

156.54 --> 163.07999999999998
hello two wolf 77 first in chat Dr utkar

160.86 --> 166.62
good to see you

163.08 --> 169.62
it is Thursday the 28th of September

166.62 --> 169.62
2023

175.319 --> 180.2
temperature is 20 degrees huh okay

180.48 --> 184.79999999999998
it's not even that much colder it's

182.94 --> 189.07999999999998
probably that the sun is hasn't been

184.8 --> 189.08
hitting my uh the wall here

191.7 --> 194.35999999999999
right

194.64 --> 200.57999999999998
so yeah I started a little late because

196.44 --> 204.07999999999998
I overslept again this time before I did

200.58 --> 209.84
actually wake up before

204.08 --> 209.84
and I rushed to get to the show

210.599 --> 216.659
just got a message there are different

213.42 --> 220.159
timeout settings is it

216.659 --> 220.159
I don't see it

224.099 --> 227.959
I only see one timeout

228.98 --> 234.29899999999998
right but I think that some things are

232.62 --> 235.92000000000002
being rearranged I had it like this

234.299 --> 238.62
notification of like all the

235.92 --> 241.79899999999998
monetization things have changed

238.62 --> 245.459
so there's like more options now that I

241.799 --> 247.56
have to click when I monetize

245.459 --> 249.84
but yeah

247.56 --> 252.0
it'll just work out fine I mean ads

249.84 --> 253.86
avoid my channel these days anyway so

252.0 --> 256.04
who cares actually

253.86 --> 256.04
foreign

266.78 --> 269.89
[Music]

270.78 --> 276.71999999999997
green tea of course still very hot I

274.259 --> 278.759
just made it

276.72 --> 282.24
I'm not gonna take a sip of that or I'm

278.759 --> 285.24
gonna burn my tongue

282.24 --> 285.24
right

287.82 --> 293.24
you don't get any ads using YouTube

289.919 --> 293.24
extended oh okay

295.68 --> 302.34000000000003
well I don't know if I'm even yeah

298.86 --> 305.46000000000004
I seem to get very little income from

302.34 --> 307.79999999999995
monetization these days

305.46 --> 311.18
but you know what let me check YouTube

307.8 --> 311.18
Studio what it says

315.78 --> 318.32
huh

319.38 --> 324.78
oh wait I guess that this month hasn't

321.9 --> 327.12
been that bad because when I just came

324.78 --> 330.5
back from having streamed on D live or

327.12 --> 330.5
what is it two months

330.8 --> 338.1
it was set to zero now it's it's set to

334.38 --> 340.38
50 estimated so that's something at

338.1 --> 343.86
least you know

340.38 --> 347.52
oh by the way Channel analysis

343.86 --> 352.44
seems like I've now gained subscribers

347.52 --> 352.44
again even though I'm still at 2769

354.419 --> 357.08
whatever

371.82 --> 374.78
right

375.72 --> 379.16
so yeah how are you all doing

385.58 --> 389.94
Rachel made a video about me yesterday

388.139 --> 392.759
apparently

389.94 --> 395.0
it was a bit late didn't actually watch

392.759 --> 395.0
it

395.699 --> 399.56
caught on right before I went to bed

401.46 --> 408.79999999999995
missed the weather report it's cloudy

404.639 --> 408.8
mostly 20 degrees cloudy

409.979 --> 413.18
mild wind

415.74 --> 422.88
nothing really that stands out just yeah

420.539 --> 424.979
what I just said

422.88 --> 427.5
right

424.979 --> 429.0
anybody take the look at the reichi

427.5 --> 431.22
video

429.0 --> 432.06
did anybody take a look at that I

431.22 --> 433.91900000000004
haven't

432.06 --> 435.66
probably should have before the show but

433.919 --> 440.78
I didn't have enough time to take a look

435.66 --> 443.24
because I overslept I think I might be

440.78 --> 445.44
needing to

443.24 --> 447.18
re-initiate the alarm clock again

445.44 --> 449.34
somehow

447.18 --> 451.88
or I just stopped going to bed so

449.34 --> 451.88
freaking late

453.479 --> 457.56
didn't watch your video okay well I'll

455.46 --> 459.599
I'll just

457.56 --> 462.66
start talking about as soon as somebody

459.599 --> 466.02
here actually watched that video

462.66 --> 467.94
but from what I got from the surface

466.02 --> 471.0
looking at it

467.94 --> 473.78
it's probably complaining about

471.0 --> 477.66
about my theory about her activities

473.78 --> 479.58
which I did roll out

477.66 --> 481.56
like yesterday on the Flat Earth debates

479.58 --> 483.65999999999997
live show and the after show and

481.56 --> 485.16
eventually most people actually sided

483.66 --> 488.96000000000004
with me there

485.16 --> 488.96000000000004
don't know if you realize is that

490.08 --> 495.8
anyway how you doing Richard G did you

492.12 --> 495.8
take a look at the video from reichi

516.959 --> 519.8
this video

541.62 --> 545.76
right anyway

543.42 --> 549.7199999999999
in the meantime

545.76 --> 552.62
some uh let's give you a Bula Dash early

549.72 --> 552.62
bird update

553.2 --> 557.4590000000001
yeah I've made a lot of progress

555.24 --> 560.1
yesterday

557.459 --> 561.959
and I mean like I feel like I'm halfway

560.1 --> 564.24
finished now

561.959 --> 565.5
because I determined a whole bunch of

564.24 --> 569.1
things

565.5 --> 571.8
I defined a whole bunch of things

569.1 --> 574.14
like right now

571.8 --> 578.04
there are like I Define everything

574.14 --> 580.279
within the fluids like how it responds

578.04 --> 583.86
and it's like it worked out

580.279 --> 585.6
magnificently like more efficient than I

583.86 --> 588.839
thought it would be

585.6 --> 591.0600000000001
and it's like I'm so proud of it right

588.839 --> 593.72
now I showed most of it to steamy

591.06 --> 593.7199999999999
traveler yesterday

594.06 --> 599.779
but that just the Dynamics of it all is

596.459 --> 599.779
just amazing right now

600.12 --> 607.08
so now beside the standard

604.08 --> 609.899
walls and boulders

607.08 --> 612.0600000000001
there are like a lot of fluids

609.899 --> 613.14
which include

612.06 --> 616.7399999999999
well

613.14 --> 618.42
hey a mid roll and I go to Mineral ad

616.74 --> 622.74
yay

618.42 --> 624.8389999999999
about the continent some

622.74 --> 627.44
Hollywood movie

624.839 --> 627.44
right

634.519 --> 639.72
hold on

637.43 --> 640.1099999999999
[Music]

639.72 --> 644.47
foreign

640.11 --> 644.47
[Music]

646.5 --> 651.959
let me get the table

649.44 --> 654.0
right so now

651.959 --> 656.16
instead of just oh there's a wall

654.0 --> 657.48
there's a boulder the boulder can fall

656.16 --> 659.399
in air

657.48 --> 662.4590000000001
well now

659.399 --> 666.24
it can fall in water

662.459 --> 668.6999999999999
it can get stuck in ice if it was in

666.24 --> 673.14
water and then water freezes

668.7 --> 676.98
it some Boulders can get stuck in lava

673.14 --> 679.98
and some Boulders can get stuck in acid

676.98 --> 682.5790000000001
right and like there is a buoyancy

679.98 --> 684.899
system now I'm so [ __ ] proud of this

682.579 --> 686.88
okay because all these different

684.899 --> 688.74
materials

686.88 --> 692.88
Stone

688.74 --> 696.48
brick or cement steel tin glass Plexi

692.88 --> 699.06
glass rubber and plastic well guess what

696.48 --> 701.64
they have they respond differently when

699.06 --> 705.0189999999999
they are suspended in liquids

701.64 --> 709.4399999999999
because some things

705.019 --> 711.3
will not fall they will float in the

709.44 --> 714.1800000000001
sense that they will stay at their same

711.3 --> 718.019
height so they won't go up and down all

714.18 --> 720.54
things in liquids soft fall as in

718.019 --> 722.1
when it goes down it goes down but it

720.54 --> 725.399
doesn't kill anything

722.1 --> 729.12
that only happens when Boulders fall

725.399 --> 731.579
in air or vacuum

729.12 --> 733.92
right so there's in all liquids they're

731.579 --> 736.3199999999999
soft falling in ice they're stuck

733.92 --> 740.3389999999999
right and some things

736.32 --> 744.5600000000001
like for example plastic will be buoyant

740.339 --> 747.899
in water that means it will fall up

744.56 --> 749.579
so some things now

747.899 --> 752.459
fall down

749.579 --> 754.5
stay floating at the same height and

752.459 --> 757.68
something will go up and I basically

754.5 --> 760.68
divided this so for example Stone

757.68 --> 762.959
Boulders don't dissolve don't get

760.68 --> 764.88
destroyed by lava

762.959 --> 767.6999999999999
but they will float

764.88 --> 769.56
so they won't actually go down

767.7 --> 773.48
while steel Bowlers will of course

769.56 --> 773.4799999999999
because they are heavier than everything

773.82 --> 779.36
and with acid it's different because

775.98 --> 782.279
only black sea glass rubber and plastic

779.36 --> 783.899
doesn't dissolve in the acid

782.279 --> 785.9399999999999
and

783.899 --> 788.04
well plastic is buoyant in there because

785.94 --> 790.6800000000001
it's going to be lighter rubber floats

788.04 --> 794.279
stays at the same height Black Sea Glass

790.68 --> 799.5
will go down because it is heavier so I

794.279 --> 803.519
literally have a density tower system in

799.5 --> 804.72
my bullet Dash and I'm so [ __ ] proud

803.519 --> 807.42
of it

804.72 --> 810.9590000000001
I'm so proud of this [ __ ] and it like

807.42 --> 810.959
it's hyperdynamic

813.18 --> 816.899
right

814.2 --> 819.0
so what happens when something that

816.899 --> 822.0
contains water which can include a

819.0 --> 824.76
boulder a boulder in water can touch

822.0 --> 826.8
lava what will happen well the water

824.76 --> 828.959
will explode water explodes when it

826.8 --> 830.88
touches lava

828.959 --> 833.279
it just does

830.88 --> 836.579
right but

833.279 --> 839.1
how it does is it explodes and then

836.579 --> 842.459
leaves the boulder behind if the boulder

839.1 --> 844.26
is immune to explosions which Stone and

842.459 --> 848.16
steel are

844.26 --> 851.04
right so the ice if it's like ice then

848.16 --> 852.7199999999999
the ice will first melt but then it

851.04 --> 856.88
turns in the water the next turn and

852.72 --> 856.88
water that touches lava explodes

858.24 --> 863.9590000000001
and so will acid by the way well now

860.639 --> 867.9590000000001
acid technically it's a bit complicated

863.959 --> 869.579
so acid can technically freeze

867.959 --> 872.2199999999999
but it's not really relevant because

869.579 --> 874.8
like freeze is really initiated by a

872.22 --> 876.4200000000001
singular block a refrigerator block that

874.8 --> 879.06
has to be next to water

876.42 --> 881.3389999999999
and activate it for it to start freezing

879.06 --> 883.38
the water like crawling through the

881.339 --> 885.7790000000001
water freezing and the only way that to

883.38 --> 890.04
unfreeze it is through Lava which will

885.779 --> 890.04
also make it explode lasers

890.579 --> 893.779
let's see where is it

894.12 --> 898.8
I stay all lasers yeah lasers will melt

897.48 --> 901.5
the eyes

898.8 --> 903.959
and lava will melt the ice and that's it

901.5 --> 905.519
so that like once water gets molted

903.959 --> 907.26
melted uh

905.519 --> 909.779
Frozen

907.26 --> 911.699
it's kind of tough to like whatever is

909.779 --> 915.38
in there because a diamond can be stuck

911.699 --> 915.38
in ice well it's kind of tough to get it

915.48 --> 920.339
you're gonna have to have a pickaxe to

918.36 --> 922.139
basically cut through the ice which is

920.339 --> 924.0600000000001
like similar to

922.139 --> 926.04
plastic

924.06 --> 928.68
oh yeah and Ice by the way is never

926.04 --> 933.66
floating it's always in a wall state

928.68 --> 935.519
because if you like start making yeah it

933.66 --> 937.68
had to be like this otherwise things get

935.519 --> 939.42
too complicated so anyway I'll stop

937.68 --> 941.76
yapping on about it

939.42 --> 944.399
I'm just really

941.76 --> 948.019
I can't believe I made so much more

944.399 --> 948.019
progress last night

948.12 --> 950.12
um

950.339 --> 955.019
yeah water turns into gas which expands

953.22 --> 957.3000000000001
quickly create a great deal for us

955.019 --> 960.6
that's right and that's why water

957.3 --> 963.3
or rather when water detects lava right

960.6 --> 966.0600000000001
next to it at any point it explodes an

963.3 --> 967.56
explosion means it goes to all the

966.06 --> 969.66
squares that surround it so it's like

967.56 --> 972.7199999999999
nine blocks with it in the center that's

969.66 --> 974.16
a standard explosion water will explode

972.72 --> 976.8000000000001
Well normally

974.16 --> 979.92
whatever explodes never leads at leaves

976.8 --> 983.279
everything unless it's water that's

979.92 --> 985.68
on top of a hardened Boulder that's

983.279 --> 987.54
explosion proof like a stone boulder or

985.68 --> 989.8199999999999
steel Builder and then if the water will

987.54 --> 992.519
explode but will leave the steel Boulder

989.82 --> 994.8000000000001
behind or the stone bowler that's the

992.519 --> 997.339
big difference so it's just like

994.8 --> 997.3389999999999
bro

998.04 --> 1001.88
so I already discussed with steamy

1000.38 --> 1005.98
Traveler

1001.88 --> 1005.98
what's going to be a thing right

1006.32 --> 1009.82
let's see where I write it down

1010.339 --> 1018.019
yeah so plexiglass rubber laser Electro

1015.62 --> 1021.38
acid puzzles

1018.019 --> 1024.14
right because there's like a body of

1021.38 --> 1026.959
acid Plexiglas goes down doesn't

1024.14 --> 1029.48
dissolve plexiglass also blocks

1026.959 --> 1031.88
electrodes

1029.48 --> 1034.48
right and so does rubber rubber however

1031.88 --> 1034.48
floats

1034.64 --> 1043.2800000000002
right laser goes through acid and

1038.9 --> 1045.5
Plexiglas does not go through rubber

1043.28 --> 1048.439
so you could have like literally a body

1045.5 --> 1052.34
of acid with with like plastic and of

1048.439 --> 1055.1000000000001
plastic glass and rubber stuff in there

1052.34 --> 1057.559
and like beams on the other side and

1055.1 --> 1060.32
like how are you gonna like maneuver

1057.559 --> 1062.96
things to make this to make it all

1060.32 --> 1066.98
activated like dude the puzzle potential

1062.96 --> 1069.98
for this game is [ __ ] insane

1066.98 --> 1072.64
it's amazing well and I mean genuinely

1069.98 --> 1072.64
amazing

1074.66 --> 1080.96
and besides plexiglass rubber laser

1078.38 --> 1081.8600000000001
Electro acid puzzles really has this

1080.96 --> 1084.14
like

1081.86 --> 1086.36
sound to it

1084.14 --> 1090.5200000000002
I mean sounds like a party I would have

1086.36 --> 1090.52
gone like 20 20 years ago

1092.38 --> 1099.679
laser Electro asset puzzle

1095.9 --> 1102.26
with people like wearing rubber

1099.679 --> 1105.22
and all that this is

1102.26 --> 1105.22
anyway

1106.7 --> 1111.38
ah doctor you watched it thanks she's

1109.52 --> 1114.98
basically butt hurt about being called

1111.38 --> 1117.919
out as in AI what

1114.98 --> 1120.1
I didn't call her out as an AI what the

1117.919 --> 1120.1000000000001
hell

1125.0 --> 1130.66
she stopped coming to the chat here

1126.98 --> 1130.66
because of that I don't give a [ __ ]

1134.179 --> 1140.0590000000002
I mean I don't need reichi to talk

1137.36 --> 1141.9189999999999
complete hard [ __ ] and like ask

1140.059 --> 1144.1399999999999
questions that are [ __ ] embarrassing

1141.919 --> 1145.8200000000002
because she absolutely should know

1144.14 --> 1147.3400000000001
better because she's been

1145.82 --> 1150.3799999999999
like

1147.34 --> 1152.9599999999998
zerged with those Arguments for years

1150.38 --> 1155.2990000000002
now

1152.96 --> 1157.3400000000001
I don't need reichi in my chat she's

1155.299 --> 1160.4
[ __ ] useless I mean she's about as

1157.34 --> 1162.1999999999998
useful in my chat as Dell is

1160.4 --> 1163.64
when he gets in here of being all

1162.2 --> 1166.94
triggered

1163.64 --> 1169.039
uh so yeah I don't really care about her

1166.94 --> 1171.559
in my chat

1169.039 --> 1174.08
it's what she said to me in the flat

1171.559 --> 1175.8799999999999
side chat oh it's her problem man like

1174.08 --> 1178.34
if he wants to come here and wants to be

1175.88 --> 1180.88
part of the what we do here then she can

1178.34 --> 1180.8799999999999
try that

1182.0 --> 1185.96
but the way that she's been acting I'm

1183.919 --> 1188.48
not super eager to have her here in chat

1185.96 --> 1190.64
I don't even know if she's like she

1188.48 --> 1193.52
could even be blocked or something I'm

1190.64 --> 1196.039
not sure I don't care

1193.52 --> 1199.82
but thanks for telling me so it's not

1196.039 --> 1201.98
even really about like oh arwen's theory

1199.82 --> 1205.82
about me was wrong

1201.98 --> 1207.679
I am not like some bimbo going back and

1205.82 --> 1211.46
forth with the Flat Earth because I love

1207.679 --> 1216.74
the tug of war no she is insulted

1211.46 --> 1219.7
because we call her a i

1216.74 --> 1219.7
what the [ __ ]

1225.919 --> 1232.6000000000001
I question if anybody knew her video

1228.86 --> 1232.6
chatted with yeah well I did do that

1234.53 --> 1237.6299999999999
[Music]

1238.52 --> 1243.799
I mean it's a genuine question right

1240.679 --> 1245.72
it's just a question you ask I mean

1243.799 --> 1247.16
maybe it's me watching that police

1245.72 --> 1250.16
series

1247.16 --> 1253.22
for like a few weeks now and I'm very

1250.16 --> 1256.039
I'm liking I'm really liking this

1253.22 --> 1258.14
old man

1256.039 --> 1260.0
and how he does things he's just so

1258.14 --> 1262.3400000000001
[ __ ] direct it like literally doesn't

1260.0 --> 1264.5
give about a [ __ ]

1262.34 --> 1266.6
it's like about anybody's well he does

1264.5 --> 1269.48
care about feelings sometimes but it's

1266.6 --> 1271.3999999999999
like no it's more important to know

1269.48 --> 1274.039
than to be careful with people's

1271.4 --> 1276.2
feelings and he's like really persistent

1274.039 --> 1278.96
about that and I'm liking it

1276.2 --> 1281.78
so yeah I was just investigating right I

1278.96 --> 1284.419
just like yeah does anybody have ever

1281.78 --> 1287.799
have video chatted with Richie yeah

1284.419 --> 1287.7990000000002
did anybody ever do that

1291.2 --> 1294.98
yeah by the way my middle finger is all

1293.36 --> 1296.7199999999998
back to normal

1294.98 --> 1299.1200000000001
it's even not

1296.72 --> 1302.419
cool like more temperature sensitive

1299.12 --> 1303.9799999999998
anymore so just a bigger update

1302.419 --> 1306.2
I have

1303.98 --> 1309.08
let's see

1306.2 --> 1312.46
all right so it looks pretty

1309.08 --> 1312.46
symmetric right now

1315.919 --> 1318.919
yay

1325.46 --> 1329.78
I think I've got another mosquito bite

1327.559 --> 1333.2
though although it might just have been

1329.78 --> 1335.6
there all this time and now

1333.2 --> 1338.059
I could have been like bitten by so

1335.6 --> 1341.0
different mosquito bites that it just

1338.059 --> 1342.5
got so bad it got swollen and all that

1341.0 --> 1345.44
that like

1342.5 --> 1347.48
I didn't even feel the other bites

1345.44 --> 1349.7
let's cut one on the side of my other

1347.48 --> 1351.6200000000001
finger next to it now

1349.7 --> 1354.02
and it's itching but it I mean that's

1351.62 --> 1357.52
not swollen or anything

1354.02 --> 1357.52
freaky anyway

1362.0 --> 1365.96
she was called AI right so it's a

1364.34 --> 1368.6789999999999
complete [ __ ] waste of time then

1365.96 --> 1368.679
Matthew Hall

1373.94 --> 1379.3400000000001
I didn't call her AI though maybe

1376.88 --> 1382.22
somebody in the chat here did but it

1379.34 --> 1384.62
just sounds like she's just whining

1382.22 --> 1388.059
not addressing anything not actually

1384.62 --> 1388.059
addressing what she does

1390.08 --> 1398.4399999999998
hello by the way Evie 97

1394.46 --> 1398.44
and Moon Rover gas h

1402.08 --> 1407.62
on tibets

1404.6 --> 1407.62
who the hell are you

1411.5 --> 1416.179
not in Dell's world I don't know what

1414.32 --> 1419.9189999999999
the [ __ ] you're talking about

1416.179 --> 1419.919
are you some kind of Dell numpty

1453.5 --> 1458.96
okay well I don't I never questioned

1456.38 --> 1460.3400000000001
whether she was a woman or not

1458.96 --> 1462.5
so

1460.34 --> 1464.8999999999999
I'm kind of disappointed so she didn't

1462.5 --> 1467.12
even like make her video in content

1464.9 --> 1469.52
response like a complaint about what I

1467.12 --> 1472.34
said it's just a bunch of whining about

1469.52 --> 1474.32
nonsense that surrounds it

1472.34 --> 1477.62
so does that mean that she's actually

1474.32 --> 1479.84
confirming my theory that that's that I

1477.62 --> 1480.9799999999998
totally call it but that she can't point

1479.84 --> 1483.4399999999998
at it

1480.98 --> 1486.58
because it's true

1483.44 --> 1486.5800000000002
is that what's going on

1488.6 --> 1493.78
yes Evie we know she is actually a woman

1498.74 --> 1502.72
oh by the way hello fruit good to see

1500.6 --> 1502.7199999999998
you

1506.539 --> 1510.58
the clip look edited hmm

1511.82 --> 1517.1589999999999
but why did she even like put me like

1515.0 --> 1518.78
video of the early bird show in that

1517.159 --> 1520.88
video I don't get it

1518.78 --> 1524.299
like whatever happened here like did

1520.88 --> 1527.3200000000002
somebody in chat say something mean

1524.299 --> 1527.32
I don't get it

1527.72 --> 1533.539
and also yeah reichi I don't have

1530.9 --> 1535.039
control over the people in my chat yeah

1533.539 --> 1537.44
if somebody shows up and they're

1535.039 --> 1540.5
suspicious they're gonna call you out

1537.44 --> 1543.2
like extremely and it's not something

1540.5 --> 1546.2
that I agree to yeah like people in the

1543.2 --> 1548.8400000000001
chat go too far they go too far that's a

1546.2 --> 1551.179
fact you do you guys go way too far

1548.84 --> 1553.82
somebody gets in here that's potentially

1551.179 --> 1556.52
hostile you go nuts on that

1553.82 --> 1558.26
some of you do and I don't agree to that

1556.52 --> 1560.6
but it's not like I'm not gonna like

1558.26 --> 1562.1
suddenly time you out for a dressing or

1560.6 --> 1564.26
something like that

1562.1 --> 1566.86
but yeah that has nothing to do with me

1564.26 --> 1566.86
though

1569.9 --> 1574.039
God so it's just a [ __ ] waste of time

1572.12 --> 1577.039
I thought it was gonna be able to

1574.039 --> 1580.039
actually talk about this and address it

1577.039 --> 1583.4
but it's just a [ __ ] whiny video that

1580.039 --> 1586.059
without any content then

1583.4 --> 1586.0590000000002

1622.64 --> 1628.039
time that happens love fruit

1624.74 --> 1629.36

1628.039 --> 1630.98
supposed

1629.36 --> 1634.1589999999999

1634.159 --> 1638.14

1638.419 --> 1643.96
you think that's exaggerated well why

1644.179 --> 1649.46
when they noticed that happens he gets

1646.46 --> 1651.98

and started noticing that like a few

1717.679 --> 1723.5590000000002

1772.88 --> 1779.419
I don't make response videos

1776.36 --> 1782.12
I never do I never have

1779.419 --> 1785.779
I will address things like on my show

1782.12 --> 1788.12
though put it up for discussion I don't

1785.779 --> 1791.08
make response videos

1788.12 --> 1791.08
I never do

1791.24 --> 1795.1
I don't even upload any videos

1797.6 --> 1800.1999999999998
hmm

1800.539 --> 1806.44
hey kumu virus happy birthday

1803.72 --> 1806.44
I guess

1810.08 --> 1814.46
eat some cake

1812.0 --> 1816.76
is it okay if I just eat an Illuminati

1814.46 --> 1816.76
also

1827.36 --> 1830.08
ah

1833.08 --> 1840.46
okay doctor I guess Scottish accent

1836.779 --> 1840.46
right now I get it

1848.48 --> 1851.02
hmm

1856.1 --> 1864.509
21 again right oh

1860.14 --> 1864.509
[Music]

1869.21 --> 1872.41
[Music]

1874.58 --> 1877.24
thank you

1885.08 --> 1887.98
hmm

1913.64 --> 1916.64
right

1943.7 --> 1948.02
getting loads of ads in the show today

1945.86 --> 1950.6789999999999
oh really

1948.02 --> 1950.679
huh

1952.76 --> 1955.6589999999999
thank you

1960.64 --> 1966.88
I guess the new ad system works then

1964.1 --> 1966.8799999999999
Emma Peel

1974.419 --> 1978.0800000000002
at least I'm getting ads you know at

1977.179 --> 1980.8400000000001
some

1978.08 --> 1984.08
because then yeah

1980.84 --> 1986.24
it's like if I don't get ads then I put

1984.08 --> 1988.6399999999999
all those ads on my videos in the past

1986.24 --> 1990.44
for absolutely nothing

1988.64 --> 1993.44
because the point is is that they stay

1990.44 --> 1996.14
there so that people watching back

1993.44 --> 1998.14
still have to get through the ads

1996.14 --> 2001.48
and that way

1998.14 --> 2004.5590000000002
eventually the revenue will start like

2001.48 --> 2004.559
taking a little bit more

2010.24 --> 2016.2
two double ads wow okay

2013.539 --> 2016.2
huh

2025.44 --> 2030.0
man I can never get these things oh

2038.279 --> 2042.279
yeah cheers

2053.859 --> 2058.119
at

2054.879 --> 2061.139
three euros and 30 cents

2058.119 --> 2061.139
I'm not joking

2061.599 --> 2066.82
if you want I can show you the receipt

2063.82 --> 2066.82
sometime

2073.98 --> 2079.179
and they're not actually called

2076.619 --> 2081.659
Illuminati songs so I thought that was

2079.179 --> 2081.659
really funny

2082.179 --> 2088.54
that they're now three Euro and 30 cents

2086.32 --> 2091.3590000000004
although it's not so funny because it's

2088.54 --> 2094.359
almost more than it's almost twice as

2091.359 --> 2096.399
expensive it was like four years ago so

2094.359 --> 2098.7999999999997
that part I'm not so amused about I am

2096.399 --> 2101.2599999999998
amused about it becoming three euros and

2098.8 --> 2103.8590000000004
30 cents though

2101.26 --> 2103.8590000000004
hmm

2140.74 --> 2146.3199999999997
all right but yeah food is getting

2142.72 --> 2148.8999999999996
expensive but also this whole [ __ ]

2146.32 --> 2151.96
War situation with Russia

2148.9 --> 2155.38
it's destabilizing

2151.96 --> 2158.32
because the stabilizing pretty badly

2155.38 --> 2160.359
like finally because like the whole

2158.32 --> 2163.06
thing is a giant corrupt setup anyway

2160.359 --> 2167.52
it's a giant banking scheme the whole

2163.06 --> 2167.52
thing is one giant banking scheme

2168.88 --> 2172.599
I mean

2170.26 --> 2175.1800000000003
since the landscape is basically like a

2172.599 --> 2177.9
white-washing war

2175.18 --> 2177.8999999999996
system

2178.06 --> 2183.099
and they're just stealing money

2179.92 --> 2185.44
everywhere and give having been given it

2183.099 --> 2187.6600000000003
by their cronies

2185.44 --> 2190.7200000000003
like billions and billions of dollars

2187.66 --> 2192.52
and Euros it's [ __ ] insane

2190.72 --> 2194.3199999999997
they're just giving it to them and

2192.52 --> 2197.82
they're not like they're not going to be

2194.32 --> 2197.82
able to do anything with it right

2198.52 --> 2204.7
it doesn't matter if we literally gave

2201.04 --> 2206.32
them all the money in the world right

2204.7 --> 2209.98
now all of it

2206.32 --> 2212.2200000000003
they still would not be able to win this

2209.98 --> 2212.22
war

2212.619 --> 2221.2000000000003
literally like give them a hundred

2217.38 --> 2224.5
quadrillion Euros like empty all banks

2221.2 --> 2227.859
all banks in the world every country

2224.5 --> 2230.8
every single one every every little Jew

2227.859 --> 2233.3199999999997
Vault every single one give them all the

2230.8 --> 2236.2000000000003
money in the world to literally fill the

2233.32 --> 2239.339
surface of Ukraine with layers of paper

2236.2 --> 2243.16
money and gold pieces and [ __ ]

2239.339 --> 2245.92
they will not be able to win the war

2243.16 --> 2248.04
with literally all the money in the

2245.92 --> 2248.04
world

2249.52 --> 2256.24
it's a giant banking scheme

2253.72 --> 2259.359
they're using Ukraine to destroy the

2256.24 --> 2262.5989999999997
West because it cannot win a war

2259.359 --> 2264.04
and so the only purpose now is for it to

2262.599 --> 2266.5
destroy the West

2264.04 --> 2268.18
by Financial depletion that's the

2266.5 --> 2270.3
strategy that's what's happening right

2268.18 --> 2270.2999999999997
now

2272.32 --> 2278.32
because literally literally not

2275.859 --> 2281.859
metaphorically literally all the money

2278.32 --> 2287.76
in the world will not enable Ukraine to

2281.859 --> 2287.7599999999998
win this war all the money in the world

2289.06 --> 2292.42
it won't do it

2290.98 --> 2295.599
you can't

2292.42 --> 2298.06
they can never win

2295.599 --> 2300.099
I called this by the way I called this

2298.06 --> 2304.54
years ago on my show

2300.099 --> 2307.54
told you Russia will win

2304.54 --> 2311.98
there's zero percent chance that Ukraine

2307.54 --> 2316.48
is going to win this zero absolute zero

2311.98 --> 2319.619
and those odds will not change even if a

2316.48 --> 2319.619
century passes by

2321.119 --> 2327.6400000000003
Russia will always win this they cannot

2324.94 --> 2329.38
lose and I know I've seen it in the dark

2327.64 --> 2331.54
world it's like one of those things I

2329.38 --> 2334.599
was absolutely certain of and that did

2331.54 --> 2337.18
play out exactly like I thought

2334.599 --> 2339.7000000000003
and it will later result that Russia is

2337.18 --> 2343.859
basically gonna get is it's gonna get it

2339.7 --> 2343.859
right it's gonna go around

2346.3 --> 2350.2000000000003
that's gonna eventually be reparations

2348.88 --> 2353.32
and [ __ ]

2350.2 --> 2355.8999999999996
to Russia because of this [ __ ] up [ __ ]

2353.32 --> 2357.04
yeah so not only are we being looted

2355.9 --> 2359.14
with money

2357.04 --> 2361.66
later we're gonna also have to pay

2359.14 --> 2363.46
reparations on top oh and we don't get

2361.66 --> 2365.6189999999997
our money back that's literally just

2363.46 --> 2367.06
been squandered and

2365.619 --> 2369.4
hidden

2367.06 --> 2371.38
by these

2369.4 --> 2374.38
these [ __ ] Nazi

2371.38 --> 2374.38
oligarchs

2375.099 --> 2380.46
in Ukraine

2377.32 --> 2380.46
that's what's gonna happen

2396.22 --> 2399.22
foreign

2404.26 --> 2406.8590000000004
foreign

2408.119 --> 2412.98
what the hell are you complaining about

2415.44 --> 2421.42
Nathan doesn't like your container

2417.76 --> 2424.0600000000004
question no EV no nobody gives a [ __ ]

2421.42 --> 2427.42
about your container question

2424.06 --> 2430.06
yeah they don't not like you they don't

2427.42 --> 2432.94
give a [ __ ] Evie

2430.06 --> 2436.92
because the container question is

2432.94 --> 2436.92
[ __ ] irrelevant is why

2441.7 --> 2448.4199999999996
yeah so the nobody gives a [ __ ] about

2444.94 --> 2450.339
your questions in the chat okay Evie let

2448.42 --> 2454.48
is that clear

2450.339 --> 2457.7799999999997
we me myself included we don't care

2454.48 --> 2459.46
about your oh smart questions in the

2457.78 --> 2461.5
chat yeah

2459.46 --> 2463.7200000000003
don't make yourself any Illusions over

2461.5 --> 2466.18
this we don't give a [ __ ] about your

2463.72 --> 2469.06
questions about Flat Earth it's all

2466.18 --> 2471.64
completely Superfluous what comes out of

2469.06 --> 2474.4
you because everything mostly is

2471.64 --> 2476.0789999999997
Superfluous when it comes to questioning

2474.4 --> 2478.599
the Flat Earth at this point the

2476.079 --> 2481.2400000000002
information that we have

2478.599 --> 2483.4
there is no more issue

2481.24 --> 2486.5789999999997
and if you want to know where the

2483.4 --> 2489.28
container is well good [ __ ] luck

2486.579 --> 2491.32
you have to have gas pressure

2489.28 --> 2492.94
yeah you have to have a container if you

2491.32 --> 2497.7000000000003
want gas pressure it doesn't matter

2492.94 --> 2497.7000000000003
where it is it has to be there

2499.599 --> 2504.76
yeah natural law natural law unavoidable

2502.54 --> 2506.859
natural law it has to be there there has

2504.76 --> 2509.8
to be a container right there

2506.859 --> 2511.42
we can get there we can't touch it we

2509.8 --> 2514.0
can't see it but it must be there

2511.42 --> 2516.82
because it's natural law and natural law

2514.0 --> 2520.42
always happens without a single

2516.82 --> 2520.42
exception possible

2521.02 --> 2525.4
laughs

2522.4 --> 2525.4
understand

2525.88 --> 2530.2000000000003
we don't have to tell you where the

2528.88 --> 2533.6800000000003
container is

2530.2 --> 2537.359
to know that there has to be a container

2533.68 --> 2537.359
because there is gas pressure

2543.94 --> 2548.2000000000003
yeah Michael Khan Jeff gasad hates you

2546.16 --> 2551.0789999999997
yeah they do because you're you're

2548.2 --> 2553.54
annoying Stevie Evie

2551.079 --> 2556.599
I will call you Stevie eventually

2553.54 --> 2559.06
if you continue being annoying

2556.599 --> 2561.28
yeah you are annoying

2559.06 --> 2565.74
I understand why they're pissed off at

2561.28 --> 2565.7400000000002
you because you are annoying Evie

2567.76 --> 2572.6400000000003
you're just not

2569.38 --> 2572.6400000000003
really a troll

2573.46 --> 2577.78
you're not an anti-flat earth or troll

2575.44 --> 2581.64
but you are annoying and you get on

2577.78 --> 2581.6400000000003
people's nerves with your attitude

2587.68 --> 2592.0
seeing the containers outside the moon

2590.02 --> 2595.2
or what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2592.0 --> 2595.2
moon orbit

2595.72 --> 2600.06
what the hell are you talking about

2597.28 --> 2600.0600000000004
orbit

2602.079 --> 2609.1600000000003
the Moon is not an object

2604.9 --> 2610.3
it isn't anywhere inside or outside the

2609.16 --> 2613.1189999999997
container

2610.3 --> 2616.42
it's just a light in the sky there is no

2613.119 --> 2619.839
orbit and the moon isn't anywhere it's

2616.42 --> 2623.5
only visually there at an angle

2619.839 --> 2624.7
that's all there is about it

2623.5 --> 2628.3
yeah

2624.7 --> 2630.66
how the gas pressure is has no relevance

2628.3 --> 2632.92
to anything about the celestial lights

2630.66 --> 2634.72
zero relevance

2632.92 --> 2637.7200000000003
yeah the celestial lights are there

2634.72 --> 2640.5989999999997
they're not in any literal position

2637.72 --> 2643.2999999999997
they're not inside the firmament outside

2640.599 --> 2646.599
the firmament inside the container close

2643.3 --> 2649.9
by far away they are not anywhere it's

2646.599 --> 2652.8
just an angular light and that's the

2649.9 --> 2652.8
only thing it is

2654.03 --> 2657.76
[Music]

2655.359 --> 2658.9
and we don't know where the container is

2657.76 --> 2662.0200000000004
located

2658.9 --> 2664.48
we know it has well we can estimate

2662.02 --> 2667.54
based on the gradiation that is present

2664.48 --> 2669.64
of the gas pressure within the available

2667.54 --> 2672.52
volume

2669.64 --> 2675.0989999999997
yeah you can base on the gradiation that

2672.52 --> 2678.099
happens on how

2675.099 --> 2681.52
the the curve is of the pressure

2678.099 --> 2683.5
decrease you can roughly estimate based

2681.52 --> 2687.22
on that but it's just an estimation it's

2683.5 --> 2692.819
no solid argument you can roughly

2687.22 --> 2692.819
estimate where it should be roughly yeah

2693.4 --> 2697.42
which is like what is it like a thousand

2695.68 --> 2700.72
miles or something

2697.42 --> 2704.26
it isn't that far away

2700.72 --> 2706.9599999999996
yeah the point is It's gotta be in a

2704.26 --> 2708.4
direction of like a thousand miles or

2706.96 --> 2712.54
something High

2708.4 --> 2714.04
and absolutely not a hundred quadrillion

2712.54 --> 2718.42
miles

2714.04 --> 2720.579
or Google Plex miles or whatever like

2718.42 --> 2723.339
the supposed outer space galaxy because

2720.579 --> 2726.52
that amount of distance would not yield

2723.339 --> 2728.5
the gradiation of the gas pressure that

2726.52 --> 2730.78
we have right here

2728.5 --> 2733.359
So based on the gradation you can

2730.78 --> 2735.0400000000004
already estimate roughly how high the

2733.359 --> 2737.38
container must be

2735.04 --> 2739.42
but we can't actually physically get

2737.38 --> 2741.599
there to get a physical confirmation of

2739.42 --> 2741.599
that

2745.9 --> 2754.14
the moon stuff is really dumb okay

2749.98 --> 2754.14
Thursday vegan whatever that means

2758.579 --> 2764.2200000000003
it's a big number yeah the point is it's

2761.74 --> 2764.22
too big

2765.76 --> 2773.7000000000003
but the gradiation that's present here

2769.42 --> 2773.7000000000003
within the gas of our Realm

2773.98 --> 2778.839
shows to yeah the gradation you can

2776.859 --> 2782.0789999999997
basically mathematically derive from

2778.839 --> 2783.339
that gradation and then get roughly a

2782.079 --> 2787.5
zero point

2783.339 --> 2787.5
a zero point in relation to the gradient

2800.079 --> 2803.1600000000003
cool thanks

2804.22 --> 2809.74
what is gradation

2806.92 --> 2812.8
gradation is pressure differential

2809.74 --> 2813.8799999999997
within a container that's gradation low

2812.8 --> 2815.6800000000003
fruit

2813.88 --> 2818.859
right so you have

2815.68 --> 2819.8799999999997
an aquarium filled with gas completely

2818.859 --> 2822.64
sealed

2819.88 --> 2825.76
then you put a heat element on one side

2822.64 --> 2828.4
of the aquarium and then a cold element

2825.76 --> 2830.3190000000004
on the other side a gradient is going to

2828.4 --> 2833.079
form slowly

2830.319 --> 2836.38
and but consistently within the gas

2833.079 --> 2840.0
pressure within that Aquarium

2836.38 --> 2840.0
it's going to have a very specific

2840.04 --> 2842.819
ratio

2842.859 --> 2846.46
by the ratio of the gas pressure

2844.72 --> 2849.5789999999997
gradient within it

2846.46 --> 2851.8
just by being on one side and seeing how

2849.579 --> 2854.1400000000003
the gas pressure decreases

2851.8 --> 2856.3590000000004
to the other to the cold side you can

2854.14 --> 2859.0789999999997
already estimate where the other side of

2856.359 --> 2863.859
the barrier is by back calculating

2859.079 --> 2866.1400000000003
basing it on the pressure decrease

2863.859 --> 2869.14
over distance

2866.14 --> 2871.54
that use that information to estimate

2869.14 --> 2873.0989999999997
the distance of the other side where it

2871.54 --> 2875.44
has to be

2873.099 --> 2878.02
that is what we can do with this with

2875.44 --> 2881.02
what we have here in this realm can

2878.02 --> 2883.599
estimate roughly where the barrier must

2881.02 --> 2886.56
be because of the gas pressure gradation

2883.599 --> 2886.56
within the row

2898.54 --> 2903.46
oh yes of course EVR is all wrong

2901.359 --> 2905.2
everybody's always [ __ ] wrong aren't

2903.46 --> 2908.02
they Evie

2905.2 --> 2911.8799999999997
everybody out there is always wrong or

2908.02 --> 2911.88
we all just get you wrong right

2914.859 --> 2921.22
it's those types of comments that just

2917.319 --> 2923.859
that's why people like Jeff gas had

2921.22 --> 2926.819
and Michael Khan just can't stand you

2923.859 --> 2930.819
because you're always whining

2926.819 --> 2930.819
whining complaining

2931.0 --> 2934.02
that sucks

2953.74 --> 2959.2
yeah of course it's okay to question

2955.66 --> 2962.56
things it's just the whining part and oh

2959.2 --> 2964.68
poor me I'm such a victim or get unfair

2962.56 --> 2969.42
treatment or something blah blah blah

2964.68 --> 2969.4199999999996
dude I get [ __ ] unfair treatment

2969.94 --> 2974.04
that doesn't mean that I'm gonna be oh

2972.4 --> 2977.619
poor me

2974.04 --> 2980.14
everywhere in the chat about it tell

2977.619 --> 2982.599
everybody oh how poorly I was treated no

2980.14 --> 2983.5
I'll I'll give my complaint like one

2982.599 --> 2986.56
time

2983.5 --> 2988.72
I'll make a mention about it on my show

2986.56 --> 2991.54
and that's it and then I move on and I

2988.72 --> 2995.64
don't whine about it continually anymore

2991.54 --> 2997.96
because whining about unfair treatment

2995.64 --> 3000.42
pisses people off

2997.96 --> 3002.839
it's [ __ ] annoying when you do that

3000.42 --> 3002.839
you see

3006.0 --> 3011.16
yeah Evie

3008.94 --> 3012.54
say that one more time I'll kick you the

3011.16 --> 3016.0789999999997
[ __ ] out

3012.54 --> 3018.24
so either you repeat the question and

3016.079 --> 3020.1600000000003
stop [ __ ] whining about it

3018.24 --> 3022.319
or I kick you out

3020.16 --> 3025.64
Evie I don't want any more [ __ ]

3022.319 --> 3025.64
whining from you you hear me

3028.56 --> 3035.22
you just repeat the question

3031.92 --> 3036.2400000000002
or you shut the [ __ ] up

3035.22 --> 3038.9399999999996
yeah

3036.24 --> 3039.8999999999996
don't [ __ ] tell me what I should be

3038.94 --> 3042.0
doing

3039.9 --> 3043.14
you repeat the question or you shut the

3042.0 --> 3046.74
[ __ ] up

3043.14 --> 3049.2799999999997
yeah no whining no more [ __ ] whining

3046.74 --> 3049.2799999999997
you hear me

3071.579 --> 3077.88
yeah you brought up dumb idea of where's

3074.94 --> 3079.68
the barrier blah oh Nathan gets so

3077.88 --> 3082.38
triggered about it so I [ __ ]

3079.68 --> 3085.44
addressed the question oh I misread

3082.38 --> 3088.26
whatever and then you have [ __ ] four

3085.44 --> 3089.46
comments whining

3088.26 --> 3092.6600000000003
yeah

3089.46 --> 3092.66
I'm not having it

3093.0 --> 3097.38
if you're just gonna be whining then

3095.28 --> 3098.8190000000004
maybe you should stay the [ __ ] out of my

3097.38 --> 3100.38
chat

3098.819 --> 3102.599
Evie

3100.38 --> 3105.1800000000003
you're making me very sorry that I've

3102.599 --> 3108.3
been defending you from these people out

3105.18 --> 3110.64
there in chats then we're very eager to

3108.3 --> 3113.3590000000004
just kick you the [ __ ] out for being a

3110.64 --> 3113.359
whiny [ __ ]

3113.46 --> 3117.839
you understand

3115.26 --> 3120.44
now I don't want to but you gotta stop

3117.839 --> 3120.44
whining

3129.18 --> 3132.18
ah

3143.579 --> 3150.42
bye guys yeah bye bye [ __ ] bye

3148.319 --> 3152.4
that's right

3150.42 --> 3154.5
if you do that one more time in my chat

3152.4 --> 3157.2200000000003
and you just whine and complain I will

3154.5 --> 3157.22
kick you out

3160.14 --> 3164.7599999999998
and if I notice that [ __ ] you're doing

3162.359 --> 3167.7
the same [ __ ] in another chat like fvd

3164.76 --> 3172.46
then I will kick you out of that as well

3167.7 --> 3172.46
you just need to stop [ __ ] whining

3185.46 --> 3191.52
you bring something up there's a

3187.38 --> 3194.1600000000003
response to it oh I didn't understand it

3191.52 --> 3196.44
I didn't read it correctly then [ __ ]

3194.16 --> 3199.41
say what you [ __ ] meant and stop

3196.44 --> 3202.46
whining about it yeah

3199.41 --> 3202.46
[Music]

3227.88 --> 3233.54
they throw a dynamite stick in the chat

3230.52 --> 3233.54
and run that's hilarious

3234.18 --> 3237.2
I know

3239.28 --> 3243.5400000000004
there's a stick of dynamite in the

3241.319 --> 3245.579
bullet Dash game but either way there is

3243.54 --> 3248.339
dynamite

3245.579 --> 3250.02
you can pick it up you can place it and

3248.339 --> 3253.0789999999997
you can light it on fire

3250.02 --> 3255.3
if something explodes into the dynamite

3253.079 --> 3257.28
then it will chain react and also

3255.3 --> 3259.8
explode

3257.28 --> 3263.28
so pilot Dynamite can literally like

3259.8 --> 3265.319
giant Chain Reaction blow up

3263.28 --> 3269.059
but you can also collect it

3265.319 --> 3269.0589999999997
take it with you and place it

3270.78 --> 3276.2400000000002
and yes literally almost anything you

3274.38 --> 3278.52
can imagine exists in the freaking

3276.24 --> 3279.7799999999997
boulder dash Super Bowl dash cam it all

3278.52 --> 3283.579
exists

3279.78 --> 3283.579
like almost everything

3284.099 --> 3288.44
just let me just take a look at the

3286.02 --> 3288.44
tools

3301.02 --> 3307.079
all right so you have the tools the

3304.8 --> 3309.3590000000004
digging tools which are a shovel a

3307.079 --> 3311.94
pickaxe and a drill hammer

3309.359 --> 3314.2799999999997
and you have the weapons a gun a laser

3311.94 --> 3316.859
gun an electro gun and a rocket launcher

3314.28 --> 3319.559
and potentially a flamethrower on top of

3316.859 --> 3321.96
that which is very handy for melting ice

3319.559 --> 3324.2400000000002
and you have the explosive stick of

3321.96 --> 3326.7
dynamite a grenade

3324.24 --> 3328.9799999999996
which is like a stick of dynamite but it

3326.7 --> 3331.0789999999997
it's full it is falling so it can

3328.98 --> 3333.0
actually you can drop it

3331.079 --> 3334.92
then you have a remote Detonator you

3333.0 --> 3336.78
place an explosive and then you can well

3334.92 --> 3338.819
remote detonate it then you have a

3336.78 --> 3340.619
remote drone which is like a suicide

3338.819 --> 3343.02
bombing drone which you can literally

3340.619 --> 3345.78
fly all around the place and then blow

3343.02 --> 3347.88
up like a remote detonator

3345.78 --> 3349.8590000000004
so those are like the Dynamics of the

3347.88 --> 3351.119
explosives available as tools and then

3349.859 --> 3354.2999999999997
you have armor

3351.119 --> 3355.98
if the keflar armor a bomb suit and a

3354.3 --> 3357.7200000000003
Mecca suit

3355.98 --> 3359.4
yeah

3357.72 --> 3362.04
kefler armor

3359.4 --> 3364.7400000000002
makes you immune to isolate you in

3362.04 --> 3366.42
electricity makes you immune to gunfire

3364.74 --> 3369.0
to basic bullets

3366.42 --> 3372.0
a bomb suit makes you literally immune

3369.0 --> 3374.16
to explosions

3372.0 --> 3375.839
but it does conduct electricity it makes

3374.16 --> 3377.819
you extra vulnerable so if lightning

3375.839 --> 3379.44
comes through you you'll blow up because

3377.819 --> 3380.579
yeah the whole thing is like a steel

3379.44 --> 3383.2200000000003
suit

3380.579 --> 3385.319
and then you have a Mecca suit which is

3383.22 --> 3388.14
like an extra special thing because that

3385.319 --> 3390.42
thing enables you to like make you

3388.14 --> 3391.98
immune to Boulder Crush

3390.42 --> 3393.599
yeah

3391.98 --> 3395.76
because you're literally in a giant

3393.599 --> 3399.42
Mecca suit which well it still takes up

3395.76 --> 3402.7200000000003
one block but think of like the uh

3399.42 --> 3405.9
the Ripley Mecca suit from Aliens the

3402.72 --> 3408.72
movie Aliens right get away from her you

3405.9 --> 3412.859
[ __ ] what a giant machine thing yeah

3408.72 --> 3415.14
that except that thing can dig and it

3412.859 --> 3419.04
can yeah immune to crush

3415.14 --> 3421.3799999999997
and you can lift Boulders in air so

3419.04 --> 3423.18
literally you can push a boulder up as

3421.38 --> 3425.339
long as it's only one Boulder above you

3423.18 --> 3427.5
we can't push more than one but you can

3425.339 --> 3429.24
go upwards push ball is upward like that

3427.5 --> 3432.079
you can only do that in a mecha suit

3429.24 --> 3432.0789999999997
right

3432.96 --> 3438.359
right and then you have a ring of Shadow

3436.02 --> 3440.22
walk and a ring of invulnerability in a

3438.359 --> 3442.46
ring of mind control and a hacking

3440.22 --> 3442.4599999999996
device

3442.5 --> 3447.96
dude

3444.92 --> 3449.2200000000003
it's too many things in this game it's

3447.96 --> 3452.4
too freaking awesome

3449.22 --> 3452.3999999999996
[Music]

3459.72 --> 3462.319
the

3462.54 --> 3467.4
adding the Drone

3464.42 --> 3470.77
yeah now that was your idea by the way

3467.4 --> 3473.1600000000003
that was steamy traveler's idea

3470.77 --> 3474.839
[Music]

3473.16 --> 3476.7599999999998
and the funny thing is there is just

3474.839 --> 3479.46
even more room for expansion it's just

3476.76 --> 3481.38
I've been mostly like focused on the

3479.46 --> 3483.54
material engine

3481.38 --> 3486.359
that's like the thing that really needs

3483.54 --> 3488.2799999999997
to work like items and what they do you

3486.359 --> 3490.38
can technically just keep adding them on

3488.28 --> 3492.3
and on and on until it's like so

3490.38 --> 3494.52
elaborate you could like please play

3492.3 --> 3495.54
racing games in bullet Ash or something

3494.52 --> 3497.7599999999998
right

3495.54 --> 3502.2
it doesn't matter how crazy you're gonna

3497.76 --> 3505.7400000000002
make it but the materials all have to

3502.2 --> 3510.2599999999998
work like the non-player stuff has to

3505.74 --> 3510.2599999999998
work that's the most complicated part

3512.099 --> 3518.119
A P 500 powered workloader yes something

3515.64 --> 3518.1189999999997
like that

3518.22 --> 3521.22
p5000.

3528.5 --> 3534.42
nuclear bomb I did actually think of

3532.14 --> 3535.799
that and then I realized how [ __ ]

3534.42 --> 3539.339
lame that was

3535.799 --> 3541.5
also nukes don't [ __ ] exist

3539.339 --> 3544.02
I don't want things to exist in the

3541.5 --> 3547.319
games that don't exist in reality

3544.02 --> 3550.559
you see I got a working physics engine

3547.319 --> 3552.54
that's like abiding to density Theory

3550.559 --> 3554.7000000000003
relative density

3552.54 --> 3557.7799999999997
I don't want to introduce introduce

3554.7 --> 3557.7799999999997
fictional [ __ ]

3558.66 --> 3562.98
oh

3559.799 --> 3565.799
and I probably want a secret code

3562.98 --> 3568.859
so you can like change the graphics of

3565.799 --> 3571.98
certain things like of creatures because

3568.859 --> 3575.0989999999997
the formerly known as butterflies that

3571.98 --> 3577.38
explode into diamonds

3575.099 --> 3579.96
I really secretly want to turn those

3577.38 --> 3582.7400000000002
into Grapplers

3579.96 --> 3582.7400000000002
it's like

3582.799 --> 3588.96
little gravelers walking around it's

3586.02 --> 3590.52
just like I don't know and they

3588.96 --> 3593.64
literally like

3590.52 --> 3595.559
drop diamonds as they go

3593.64 --> 3597.9
I mean

3595.559 --> 3600.78
uh

3597.9 --> 3603.059
I want it to be possible I'm probably

3600.78 --> 3604.559
like gonna turn them into Elementals or

3603.059 --> 3606.78
something it's like oh they are

3604.559 --> 3608.579
crystalline Elementals like weird

3606.78 --> 3611.88
figures that explode in diamonds because

3608.579 --> 3616.46
they are they are like diamonds but I

3611.88 --> 3616.46
want a Grappler picture option

3618.38 --> 3624.119
better keep the levels flat entire

3621.839 --> 3628.38
bullet Dash game is flat

3624.119 --> 3631.52
it's a one layer game it's a matrix one

3628.38 --> 3631.52
layer Matrix Game

3636.599 --> 3641.7000000000003
we hope nuclear Powers Yeah never said

3638.76 --> 3644.5200000000004
nuclear power stations aren't real

3641.7 --> 3647.2799999999997
that's a power generator

3644.52 --> 3649.799
that's different it's just nuclear bombs

3647.28 --> 3652.1600000000003
oh so popular yeah let's not do nuclear

3649.799 --> 3652.16
bombs

3652.319 --> 3659.099
I mean there's already like

3655.38 --> 3662.04
explosive blocks explosive blocks are

3659.099 --> 3663.96
like wider explosions

3662.04 --> 3666.42
because they are basically instead of

3663.96 --> 3670.2
like a stick of dynamite it's like the

3666.42 --> 3672.299
entire it's a wall of explosives

3670.2 --> 3675.54
which doesn't move you can't pick it up

3672.299 --> 3677.64
it but if it blows it blows big

3675.54 --> 3680.099
so it leaves a hole bigger than nine

3677.64 --> 3682.74
blocks

3680.099 --> 3687.299
but I'm not gonna do a nuke

3682.74 --> 3691.0789999999997
no nukes it's [ __ ] lame

3687.299 --> 3693.599
and it's like very inconvenient

3691.079 --> 3694.98
dude there's already

3693.599 --> 3697.7400000000002
all over

3694.98 --> 3700.319
and there's a freaking vacuum pump

3697.74 --> 3702.859
there's a refrigerator

3700.319 --> 3702.859
pump

3704.46 --> 3708.359
dude do you know how [ __ ] up a vacuum

3706.5 --> 3710.52
pump in this game is

3708.359 --> 3714.24
when you hear like you're walking around

3710.52 --> 3716.819
you see open air and you hear

3714.24 --> 3720.5989999999997
you're like oh [ __ ]

3716.819 --> 3722.88
oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] because like okay which

3720.599 --> 3724.5
of this air if I'm gonna touch I'm gonna

3722.88 --> 3726.9
explode because it turned out to be

3724.5 --> 3730.559
vacuum

3726.9 --> 3733.64
yeah vacuum is really freaking dangerous

3730.559 --> 3736.079
and you don't see it you only hear that

3733.64 --> 3737.819
the vacuum pump thing though and that's

3736.079 --> 3739.559
how you know there's a vacuum it's the

3737.819 --> 3741.54
only way you can see it

3739.559 --> 3745.0400000000004
and you can't see the difference between

3741.54 --> 3745.04
normal air and vacuum

3745.74 --> 3750.4199999999996
so as soon as you just walk into a

3748.98 --> 3752.579
vacuum seal

3750.42 --> 3755.94
even if it hasn't been pumped out yet

3752.579 --> 3757.799
completely because yeah it works you

3755.94 --> 3760.26
just you're delivered by the mechanic so

3757.799 --> 3763.2599999999998
what is happening is vacuum pump starts

3760.26 --> 3767.28
pumping literally turning

3763.26 --> 3769.3190000000004
the normal air into a vacuum block and

3767.28 --> 3771.48
then expanding it at in the available

3769.319 --> 3773.46
AIR block so it only goes into air

3771.48 --> 3775.859
blocks and it basically grows and then

3773.46 --> 3779.4
as soon as the vacuum pump stops

3775.859 --> 3782.7599999999998
then it all goes but it basically goes

3779.4 --> 3785.64
and it all turns into air again

3782.76 --> 3787.7990000000004
but you can like be danger you can have

3785.64 --> 3791.64
different air pockets

3787.799 --> 3794.22
one being a vacuum pump the other not

3791.64 --> 3796.6189999999997
just being air you like open the bridge

3794.22 --> 3800.2799999999997
in between that you're not gonna explode

3796.619 --> 3802.7400000000002
into it yeah I know but there's no like

3800.28 --> 3804.299
explosion based displacement in the

3802.74 --> 3805.4399999999996
entire boulder dash if I start making

3804.299 --> 3808.38
that

3805.44 --> 3812.2400000000002
it's going to be total Fubar like it's

3808.38 --> 3812.2400000000002
going to be completely uncontrollable

3813.42 --> 3817.619
I mean it'll look cool sure but it'll be

3815.579 --> 3820.7400000000002
completely uncontrollable so there's no

3817.619 --> 3823.6800000000003
vacuum implosions or anything but the

3820.74 --> 3825.7799999999997
vacuum will keep crawling so you open up

3823.68 --> 3828.96
the bridge and then you have to like

3825.78 --> 3831.9
flee so you're like running digging as

3828.96 --> 3833.64
like the vacuum is crawling up to you in

3831.9 --> 3836.2200000000003
the air that you're leaving behind

3833.64 --> 3838.98
that's what would happen

3836.22 --> 3841.2
and at that time you're mostly gonna

3838.98 --> 3843.299
rush to find a switch to turn off the

3841.2 --> 3846.74
fridge or to turn off the vacuum pump

3843.299 --> 3846.74
because as soon as you turn it off

3847.079 --> 3852.299
and then it's all safe again no matter

3849.599 --> 3854.52
how big the vacuum was that's just how

3852.299 --> 3857.18
it's gonna work it's the best way I can

3854.52 --> 3857.18
get it to work

3858.83 --> 3862.98
[Music]

3859.98 --> 3865.28
hello duper poons you know how to

3862.98 --> 3865.28
program

3866.04 --> 3872.299
a little so I I know how it works I

3868.92 --> 3872.299
haven't actually done it though

3874.619 --> 3879.079
but I'm sure I'm going to be able to get

3876.42 --> 3879.079
some pointers

3881.7 --> 3886.4399999999996
I'm just so freaking happy with what I

3884.04 --> 3889.16
got here man let me show you the table

3886.44 --> 3889.16
for a bit

3894.359 --> 3902.52
uh what

3898.14 --> 3905.66
why is it not Joe what the f

3902.52 --> 3905.66
why is it showing

3905.94 --> 3908.839
what's going on

3914.46 --> 3916.7
foreign

3918.0 --> 3923.0
what the hell

3919.799 --> 3923.0
what's going on

3923.579 --> 3930.5
oh didn't turn it off

3926.579 --> 3930.5
okay hold on uh

3947.04 --> 3951.599
right

3949.02 --> 3953.16
this should work

3951.599 --> 3956.339
all right so I just want to show you

3953.16 --> 3958.92
what I got so far

3956.339 --> 3961.2
so here we go this will look very

3958.92 --> 3966.48
similar to what you saw yesterday

3961.2 --> 3969.0789999999997
except it's freaking vast so now

3966.48 --> 3972.72
you have all the wall tables over here

3969.079 --> 3975.2400000000002
have the fluid tables which is like the

3972.72 --> 3978.54
background stuff without anything in it

3975.24 --> 3982.4399999999996
and then you have all the tables

3978.54 --> 3985.02
of all boulders within that fluid

3982.44 --> 3986.88
because fluids are only like only

3985.02 --> 3988.859
compatible with Boulders it can get

3986.88 --> 3991.7400000000002
through Boulders and Bowlers can get

3988.859 --> 3994.74
through it and that includes air

3991.74 --> 3997.5
if so all the boulders in air bogus and

3994.74 --> 3999.72
water Boulders and Ice bullish and lava

3997.5 --> 4002.539
bulbish and acid because most things

3999.72 --> 4004.2799999999997
just get destroyed by lava and acid so

4002.539 --> 4006.079
it doesn't like have to there doesn't

4004.28 --> 4009.079
have to be a separate icon of it's

4006.079 --> 4010.94
sitting in it it'll simply destroy that

4009.079 --> 4013.099
and then replace it

4010.94 --> 4016.099
but there are some that will stay in

4013.099 --> 4018.2000000000003
there like steel and stone Boulders will

4016.099 --> 4019.579
remain in lava they will remain intact

4018.2 --> 4022.22
in life so there has to be a block

4019.579 --> 4024.38
specifically of those things in lava

4022.22 --> 4027.2
it's a separate block

4024.38 --> 4030.559
and same goes with acid right Plexiglas

4027.2 --> 4032.18
rubber and plastic remain intact in the

4030.559 --> 4033.92
acid

4032.18 --> 4036.3799999999997
so it has to be separate blocks of them

4033.92 --> 4038.0
right so there's the creature table of

4036.38 --> 4040.039
like moving creatures then there's the

4038.0 --> 4041.9
amoeba table

4040.039 --> 4043.76
creature table could potentially be

4041.9 --> 4045.92
expanded already expanded from the

4043.76 --> 4047.9
original guard and Butterfly I made

4045.92 --> 4049.76
robots in there which function

4047.9 --> 4051.98
differently

4049.76 --> 4054.619
they're very different types

4051.98 --> 4055.94
one is like almost completely immune to

4054.619 --> 4059.599
almost everything

4055.94 --> 4062.48
which is very dangerous by the way

4059.599 --> 4065.1800000000003
like security robots when they are in

4062.48 --> 4068.119
explosions they don't blow up

4065.18 --> 4070.2799999999997
this is going to be [ __ ] scary

4068.119 --> 4073.339
it's like you want to avoid a security

4070.28 --> 4075.26
robot they will [ __ ] you up

4073.339 --> 4079.099
and they're very difficult to get rid of

4075.26 --> 4081.619
like the only real way is a boulder

4079.099 --> 4082.94
Crush it's like get a rock to drop on

4081.619 --> 4084.6800000000003
them that's like the only way you can

4082.94 --> 4086.0
break them because if they're next to an

4084.68 --> 4087.799
explosion

4086.0 --> 4089.78
nothing happens they get hit by an

4087.799 --> 4093.0389999999998
electrode nothing happens they get hit

4089.78 --> 4093.039
by a laser nothing happens

4093.559 --> 4097.819
it's like unless you can get them to

4095.539 --> 4099.08
touch lava or acid then they will blow

4097.819 --> 4101.120000000001
up

4099.08 --> 4104.54
now of course the Digger robot digging

4101.12 --> 4107.14
through sand like changing the level

4104.54 --> 4107.14
potentially

4107.179 --> 4113.179
right and then there's the machines all

4111.319 --> 4114.799
the machines laser generator Electro

4113.179 --> 4117.9400000000005
generator barrier generator stone

4114.799 --> 4122.199
diamond sand vacuum water

4117.94 --> 4122.199
lava acid pumps

4122.42 --> 4128.359
guard Factory butterfly Factory security

4125.239 --> 4130.5199999999995
robot Digger robot factories like those

4128.359 --> 4132.1990000000005
come out of there if you yeah you can

4130.52 --> 4133.9400000000005
have them in your level or you don't and

4132.199 --> 4135.98
you just have a preset amount of those

4133.94 --> 4138.259
things in there but this way you can

4135.98 --> 4140.12
have them continually produced and of

4138.259 --> 4142.4
course switches pressure switch lever

4140.12 --> 4144.679
switch button switch

4142.4 --> 4147.5599999999995
growing walls

4144.679 --> 4149.56
reflectors that change the directions of

4147.56 --> 4152.54
lasers

4149.56 --> 4154.819
refrigerator yeah that actually creates

4152.54 --> 4157.96
the ice out of water

4154.819 --> 4157.96
Dynamite block

4159.859 --> 4162.859
that's not the right word explosive

4161.719 --> 4166.46
block

4162.859 --> 4166.46
whatever teleports

4167.779 --> 4172.1
toll booths

4169.4 --> 4174.139999999999
right it's like oh if you want to open

4172.1 --> 4177.319
it you have to have this many diamonds

4174.14 --> 4179.900000000001
or this many gems and then click the

4177.319 --> 4181.339000000001
block goes away you can move through it

4179.9 --> 4184.639999999999
permanently

4181.339 --> 4187.219
so that's a tall move very basic concept

4184.64 --> 4189.7390000000005
very useful for puzzles

4187.219 --> 4192.92
right and then you have all the tools

4189.739 --> 4195.199
and here's a start of the library of all

4192.92 --> 4198.08
the actions and this one is really the

4195.199 --> 4200.239
Mind twister because the entire game is

4198.08 --> 4204.64
going to be all about these very

4200.239 --> 4208.699
specific actions so by naming it this

4204.64 --> 4211.6990000000005
you super hard Cho like shorten

4208.699 --> 4214.879999999999
the actual code because I'll just have

4211.699 --> 4217.0
to say this that happened then that and

4214.88 --> 4219.08
then erode

4217.0 --> 4221.12
right or

4219.08 --> 4223.94
destroy

4221.12 --> 4226.96
or gem destroy or evaporate because

4223.94 --> 4229.82
those words are very specifically

4226.96 --> 4231.7390000000005
ascribed to an entire process and now I

4229.82 --> 4234.08
only have to use these words in the

4231.739 --> 4237.379999999999
basic instructions which then point at

4234.08 --> 4240.5
this so I don't have to fill all of that

4237.38 --> 4242.900000000001
into one block of routine text

4240.5 --> 4245.54
so that's how I'm going at work

4242.9 --> 4250.219
and I'm really freaking far

4245.54 --> 4252.219
as you can see it's one two three

4250.219 --> 4252.219
four

4252.56 --> 4255.9400000000005
roughly five pages

4259.219 --> 4262.179
there you go

4267.44 --> 4271.659
column A and C are yeah it's just for

4269.96 --> 4275.719
space

4271.659 --> 4279.46
it has to look somewhat orderly this is

4275.719 --> 4279.46
this is not ah

4281.03 --> 4284.09
[Music]

4284.84 --> 4290.179
yeah I leave room

4287.54 --> 4291.0199999999995
sometimes I I don't like filling in the

4290.179 --> 4295.659
a

4291.02 --> 4295.659000000001
column I just don't like that in general

4297.08 --> 4305.86
bro what the hell what's going on here

4300.5 --> 4305.86
you two plus behind a lot that was weird

4311.78 --> 4316.099999999999
so you can't stop the show I know what a

4314.239 --> 4318.44
spreadsheet is for low fruit I know how

4316.1 --> 4321.679
it works you can like make calculations

4318.44 --> 4323.0599999999995
and then make it it's like have a bar

4321.679 --> 4324.52
that says like

4323.06 --> 4329.360000000001
uh

4324.52 --> 4331.34
add all Columns of this to this and then

4329.36 --> 4333.62
it automatically calculates the number

4331.34 --> 4335.3
whatever in there and places it in that

4333.62 --> 4337.04
box I know how it works I've used

4335.3 --> 4338.3
spreadsheet for actual spreadsheet work

4337.04 --> 4341.06
too

4338.3 --> 4345.320000000001
low fruit I'm not using it I'm using it

4341.06 --> 4348.219
as a drawing writing Matrix that's what

4345.32 --> 4348.219
I'm using it for

4348.98 --> 4354.459999999999
space doesn't what what are you talking

4351.02 --> 4354.46
about talk dude girl

4357.679 --> 4360.7390000000005
no space exists in the game though it's

4359.96 --> 4363.32
like

4360.739 --> 4365.419999999999
the level is the level and I've just

4363.32 --> 4367.34
determined outside of the level as a

4365.42 --> 4368.9
vacuum because it used to always be

4367.34 --> 4371.179
black out there

4368.9 --> 4374.12
and if you don't do that

4371.179 --> 4376.64
then even if there is a bug you walk out

4374.12 --> 4378.98
of the level that used to be a hilarious

4376.64 --> 4380.12
Fun by the way sometimes there were bugs

4378.98 --> 4382.159
in boulder dash where you could

4380.12 --> 4383.42
literally like walk out of the level and

4382.159 --> 4384.17
you wouldn't see yourself but you could

4383.42 --> 4386.3
hear yourself

4384.17 --> 4388.52
[Music]

4386.3 --> 4390.1990000000005
but you couldn't see where you were but

4388.52 --> 4392.659000000001
you could just walk out of the level

4390.199 --> 4394.699
that was crazy fun

4392.659 --> 4396.44
it wouldn't amount to anything but yeah

4394.699 --> 4398.419999999999
you could just do it you could just walk

4396.44 --> 4399.98
out of the level and then not see where

4398.42 --> 4403.04
you are anymore and walk into the

4399.98 --> 4405.678999999999
emptiness off screen amazing stuff well

4403.04 --> 4407.06
that's not gonna happen anymore now it's

4405.679 --> 4409.159
literally gonna be more like a

4407.06 --> 4413.120000000001
spaceshift setup

4409.159 --> 4414.62
mostly I think maybe it could be dynamic

4413.12 --> 4416.659
because technically you could make it

4414.62 --> 4420.0199999999995
however you want you can have it all be

4416.659 --> 4422.599999999999
in stone you can have it all be in a

4420.02 --> 4425.42
vacuum you can have it all be

4422.6 --> 4428.42
bro underwater if you want it

4425.42 --> 4429.76
you can have a border surrounding by

4428.42 --> 4431.9
stuff whatever

4429.76 --> 4434.12
especially now that you have all these

4431.9 --> 4435.379999999999
materials and yeah vacuum is a material

4434.12 --> 4436.58
so could you you could literally

4435.38 --> 4438.9800000000005
determine

4436.58 --> 4441.86
the level is surrounded by a layer of

4438.98 --> 4444.919999999999
vacuum and then even like oh the acid

4441.86 --> 4447.199
burns through the the stone border on

4444.92 --> 4450.5
the outside

4447.199 --> 4452.9
and then the vacuum just starts rushing

4450.5 --> 4454.88
in the available air and it all becomes

4452.9 --> 4458.679
deadly

4454.88 --> 4458.679
that was just an idea I had

4465.8 --> 4472.76
you have spreadsheets that exceeded

4468.88 --> 4474.5
million rows Jesus

4472.76 --> 4476.900000000001
damn

4474.5 --> 4479.239
holy [ __ ] that's

4476.9 --> 4483.759999999999
a big [ __ ] that's a big freaking

4479.239 --> 4483.759999999999
spreadsheet damn appeal Jesus

4484.159 --> 4488.48
damn

4486.1 --> 4490.88
all right Dr ootgar I hope you're having

4488.48 --> 4492.62
fun out there hope you guys are enjoying

4490.88 --> 4495.08
the show by the way

4492.62 --> 4497.5
made possible thanks to blue pill

4495.08 --> 4497.5
evolution

4498.26 --> 4501.400000000001
thank you for the support

4502.4 --> 4507.639999999999
Circle driven what am I missing

4505.46 --> 4507.64
something

4511.46 --> 4518.06
they all hate Evie she has coherent

4515.06 --> 4518.06
arguments

4519.44 --> 4523.178999999999
really she does gas h

4523.219 --> 4526.84
uh you think

4531.44 --> 4535.9
of a table fine then call it a table

4534.26 --> 4539.719
then

4535.9 --> 4541.099999999999
I'm not good enough ooh are we this is

4539.719 --> 4543.5
nothing

4541.1 --> 4545.84
oh you think you're having a complicated

4543.5 --> 4550.219
thing you're building there's nothing

4545.84 --> 4552.5
man so much more out there so just uh

4550.219 --> 4556.12
you're not really good cool

4552.5 --> 4556.12
making a game from scratch

4556.46 --> 4559.12
like that

4559.94 --> 4565.58
yeah it's B it's a big freaking game and

4563.06 --> 4568.46
other people tend to not make games like

4565.58 --> 4570.86
this because it's over complicated

4568.46 --> 4573.199
because it's really hard to keep track

4570.86 --> 4575.0599999999995
of how everything works

4573.199 --> 4577.759999999999
yeah the biggest problem with people

4575.06 --> 4579.56
will bump into is that there's holes as

4577.76 --> 4581.42
in oh yeah yeah of course this functions

4579.56 --> 4583.46
like that and that and then it's like

4581.42 --> 4585.14
yeah but what happens when these come

4583.46 --> 4588.94
together like

4585.14 --> 4592.46
like oh I don't know

4588.94 --> 4595.339999999999
uh yeah yeah well in this case I know

4592.46 --> 4597.86
everything like I know every combination

4595.34 --> 4601.84
and what happens and how it happens

4597.86 --> 4605.179
and I know how to define it an orderly

4601.84 --> 4607.64
integrated in the system

4605.179 --> 4611.1990000000005
I know what I'm doing like this entire

4607.64 --> 4611.1990000000005
thing is super organized

4614.179 --> 4618.88
you didn't mean it like that okay fine

4615.98 --> 4618.879999999999
gas age

4619.58 --> 4624.92
talking about spreadsheets sure I've

4623.36 --> 4626.96
never worked with spreadsheets

4624.92 --> 4629.4800000000005
professionally but I have used I've made

4626.96 --> 4632.4800000000005
I use them for making my book too

4629.48 --> 4634.659
for my my trolls and tyrants I'll show

4632.48 --> 4634.659
you

4635.06 --> 4637.820000000001
because

4636.199 --> 4641.0
those

4637.82 --> 4644.799999999999
uh PDFs

4641.0 --> 4644.8
they didn't start out like that

4651.62 --> 4656.92
wait another 10 seconds for my hard disk

4654.44 --> 4656.919999999999
to start up

4657.34 --> 4661.04
uh

4659.0 --> 4664.06
right so let's just show for example

4661.04 --> 4664.06
base classes

4666.8 --> 4669.8
oh

4681.88 --> 4685.06
come on

4692.06 --> 4697.04
right so here's the

4695.0 --> 4699.86
original

4697.04 --> 4701.659
PDF right so it's the base class I had

4699.86 --> 4704.9
this awesome links you can literally oh

4701.659 --> 4707.599999999999
click fighter go to fighter

4704.9 --> 4709.82
yeah I made this I'm so [ __ ] proud of

4707.6 --> 4711.5
it I've had a lot of help with friends

4709.82 --> 4714.08
that have not really my friends anymore

4711.5 --> 4717.02
but yeah so this is like

4714.08 --> 4718.76
very palatable but that's not how it

4717.02 --> 4722.02
started you see

4718.76 --> 4722.02
it started

4725.719 --> 4729.04
like this

4732.14 --> 4737.679
let's see if it

4734.179 --> 4737.679
sticks where are you

4740.719 --> 4747.38
right so it started like this

4743.54 --> 4752.0
this is how I originally made it

4747.38 --> 4755.06
and yeah because it's just handy to make

4752.0 --> 4757.94
these kinds of tables

4755.06 --> 4761.84
but it's like yeah just this and then a

4757.94 --> 4764.839999999999
big slab of text in just one line

4761.84 --> 4767.42
so if it's really big then it will

4764.84 --> 4770.0
become a lot bigger like see like a

4767.42 --> 4771.62
block of text that eventually then put

4770.0 --> 4773.84
into a

4771.62 --> 4776.239
into the writing engine but I started

4773.84 --> 4777.62
making all these Dungeons and dragon

4776.239 --> 4780.139999999999
stuff

4777.62 --> 4783.88
all in spreadsheets because it's just so

4780.14 --> 4783.88
orderly that way

4789.92 --> 4795.14
it's like it's easy to make like a

4792.92 --> 4796.46
layout before you actually start working

4795.14 --> 4798.860000000001
on Leia

4796.46 --> 4800.78
so you can have an it's like oh it's

4798.86 --> 4802.159
gonna have this kind of look

4800.78 --> 4804.86
and that's what you can do with a

4802.159 --> 4806.78
spreadsheet to me it's like a

4804.86 --> 4810.139999999999
it's almost like

4806.78 --> 4812.78
just a piece of paper but with the grid

4810.14 --> 4815.42
right a gridded piece of paper that's

4812.78 --> 4817.28
that's what a spreadsheet is to me it's

4815.42 --> 4819.26
just a grated piece of paper but you can

4817.28 --> 4822.82
put like infinite amount of text in one

4819.26 --> 4822.820000000001
little block that's the difference

4823.28 --> 4828.259999999999
okay

4824.5 --> 4829.58
just need word and printer PDF little no

4828.26 --> 4831.56
not really

4829.58 --> 4834.86
now I had to actually

4831.56 --> 4836.780000000001
transform it into PDF you can do that by

4834.86 --> 4840.5599999999995
the way

4836.78 --> 4842.78
like with regular text

4840.56 --> 4846.7390000000005
so you basically just copy the text from

4842.78 --> 4850.42
the spreadsheet into the document so

4846.739 --> 4850.419999999999
I don't use word what is it called again

4851.12 --> 4857.36
no yeah open Open document

4854.96 --> 4859.46
Open document text

4857.36 --> 4862.759999999999
that that's what I use I use Open

4859.46 --> 4866.36
document I don't use word I don't use

4862.76 --> 4868.9400000000005
I'd use OpenOffice always have

4866.36 --> 4870.98
is much better it is better it is

4868.94 --> 4872.48
actually better

4870.98 --> 4874.699
so

4872.48 --> 4877.82
take it from the spreadsheet put it in

4874.699 --> 4880.879999999999
the regular text document

4877.82 --> 4883.219
and that's then turned in converted into

4880.88 --> 4886.34
a PDF and that's yeah that's what I

4883.219 --> 4888.76
showed right that's my trolls and

4886.34 --> 4888.76
tyrants

4890.06 --> 4893.92
PDF

4891.5 --> 4893.92
stuff

4898.699 --> 4903.259999999999
open Office is very limited

4901.82 --> 4905.9
oh

4903.26 --> 4908.54
I'm sure it is

4905.9 --> 4911.239
the thing is though it's free I've

4908.54 --> 4912.199
worked with it over it what am I talking

4911.239 --> 4914.839999999999
about

4912.199 --> 4919.099999999999
almost two decades

4914.84 --> 4923.12
and it works absolutely fantastically

4919.1 --> 4925.820000000001
yeah but I'm sure other versions will

4923.12 --> 4927.98
have more options that I'll never ever

4925.82 --> 4929.0599999999995
[ __ ] use or even want to know they

4927.98 --> 4931.28
exist

4929.06 --> 4936.02
yeah that's the difference just like

4931.28 --> 4939.82
Photoshop yeah I use Photoshop 7.

4936.02 --> 4943.46
yeah you heard me seven like of 2003

4939.82 --> 4946.219
yeah oh the newer photoshops has so many

4943.46 --> 4950.12
more options yeah and I don't give a

4946.219 --> 4952.719
[ __ ] and it's free and it works and I

4950.12 --> 4956.0
can do a lot of stuff with it yeah

4952.719 --> 4958.82
Photoshop 7 is fantastic

4956.0 --> 4961.94
and it's free

4958.82 --> 4963.98
I'm sure the latest one has like oh

4961.94 --> 4967.94
would have like thousand more options

4963.98 --> 4970.04
yeah oh yes that dude Photoshop 7 has

4967.94 --> 4973.9
like hundreds of options that I don't

4970.04 --> 4973.9
even understand like I don't care

4978.5 --> 4983.84
who knows I can do whatever the [ __ ] I

4981.32 --> 4986.96
want Johnny and I can be as sensitive or

4983.84 --> 4991.3
overreacting or over enthusiastic

4986.96 --> 4991.3
as I'd see fit

4995.9 --> 4999.5
ps7 is awesome for the vast majority of

4998.48 --> 5002.699
people yeah

4999.5 --> 5002.699
it should be dress

5003.4 --> 5007.86
it should be I've been using it for

5005.38 --> 5007.86
decades

5022.679 --> 5026.86
Microsoft would stop moving and stuff

5024.88 --> 5030.34
around when they update yeah

5026.86 --> 5033.28
well you know you can fix that M appeal

5030.34 --> 5035.02
you stop updating

5033.28 --> 5037.96
what the [ __ ] you think you're even

5035.02 --> 5040.900000000001
gonna achieve by their updates seriously

5037.96 --> 5041.7390000000005
what the hell do you think it'll do for

5040.9 --> 5045.699
you

5041.739 --> 5048.58
I haven't updated windows in like

5045.699 --> 5050.199
five years at least

5048.58 --> 5052.679
probably more

5050.199 --> 5055.36
hey guess what my computer works

5052.679 --> 5058.719
absolutely perfectly

5055.36 --> 5061.299999999999
it works so well that I even had like

5058.719 --> 5064.3
another the motherboard switch remember

5061.3 --> 5065.860000000001
that earlier this year

5064.3 --> 5068.4400000000005
was it this year was the year before

5065.86 --> 5070.719
where it broke down and I had to like

5068.44 --> 5072.159
get a new motherboard replaced was that

5070.719 --> 5073.06
this year or the pre-feature I don't

5072.159 --> 5075.339999999999
remember

5073.06 --> 5078.76
it was the previous year wasn't it last

5075.34 --> 5082.12
year 2023 22.

5078.76 --> 5084.58
yeah so I added all this time

5082.12 --> 5086.86
I didn't even change anything it's just

5084.58 --> 5090.159
like I had the new motherboard in

5086.86 --> 5093.159
basically a new computer new processor

5090.159 --> 5097.239
took the Windows installation and it

5093.159 --> 5100.599999999999
just worked without a single update yeah

5097.239 --> 5103.36
that's how important Windows updates are

5100.6 --> 5105.280000000001
yeah so important no

5103.36 --> 5108.339999999999
now they aren't they're completely

5105.28 --> 5112.259999999999
useless I mean when you just have to

5108.34 --> 5115.360000000001
have a just a raw clean windows install

5112.26 --> 5116.5
yeah you want some updates

5115.36 --> 5119.739
but

5116.5 --> 5122.08
you don't need all the freaking updates

5119.739 --> 5124.599999999999
it's gonna like try to force updates on

5122.08 --> 5127.0
you that are completely [ __ ] useless

5124.6 --> 5130.120000000001
or that'll ruin things

5127.0 --> 5133.239
so you just stop doing that

5130.12 --> 5136.96
my updates Windows 7 as far as it goes

5133.239 --> 5139.44
and I literally will never need any more

5136.96 --> 5139.44
than that

5145.36 --> 5151.179
everyone's machine have to be compatible

5148.54 --> 5153.219
yeah well

5151.179 --> 5155.38
you know there's an easy way to fix it

5153.219 --> 5157.96
mmpo

5155.38 --> 5159.34
you install Windows 7 on all those

5157.96 --> 5160.719
computers

5159.34 --> 5162.58
and they're all going to have the same

5160.719 --> 5164.86
issues they're all gonna be like oh we

5162.58 --> 5166.719
can't update any further oh yeah yeah

5164.86 --> 5169.0
well that's where it all stops then and

5166.719 --> 5172.54
it all just works perfectly

5169.0 --> 5174.699
without any update whining yeah and they

5172.54 --> 5176.56
all will not be able to update Beyond a

5174.699 --> 5178.178999999999
certain point so they will all be

5176.56 --> 5180.280000000001
synchronized

5178.179 --> 5181.659
it's a perfect way to go just install

5180.28 --> 5184.239
Windows 7

5181.659 --> 5187.12
update it to where it could no longer

5184.239 --> 5189.339999999999
update they will all be the same and

5187.12 --> 5191.86
they will never have

5189.34 --> 5194.5
issues of not being synchronous again

5191.86 --> 5196.12
because they will no longer update and

5194.5 --> 5198.699
they're all literally they can only

5196.12 --> 5201.719
update to that same level

5198.699 --> 5201.719
perfect solution

5207.94 --> 5213.879999999999
in my world you can yeah you can you see

5211.179 --> 5216.36
there is no program I can't run on my

5213.88 --> 5219.04
computer here Windows 7

5216.36 --> 5225.42
uses everything

5219.04 --> 5225.42
Windows 10 and 11 are all horseshit

5227.62 --> 5231.719
they're all just windows 7.

5236.139 --> 5239.679
downgrade 8 000 machines the windows

5238.42 --> 5242.62
yeah

5239.679 --> 5245.86
oh I'm sure that the manager doesn't

5242.62 --> 5248.0199999999995
like it because they're [ __ ] retards

5245.86 --> 5251.739
as most managers are when it comes to it

5248.02 --> 5254.139
stuff yeah they don't get it

5251.739 --> 5256.599999999999
they wouldn't say oh but it's a late

5254.139 --> 5258.400000000001
it's an older version yeah yeah dude you

5256.6 --> 5261.58
could have said that the same about

5258.4 --> 5263.44
Windows Millennium Edition and managers

5261.58 --> 5266.38
would still say no we're not going to

5263.44 --> 5270.58
use Windows 98 I want Millennium Edition

5266.38 --> 5272.8
it's the newer one yeah and the most

5270.58 --> 5275.5
buggy [ __ ] windows in their history

5272.8 --> 5277.4800000000005
of windows but managers would still say

5275.5 --> 5279.52
no we're not going to downgrade I want

5277.48 --> 5281.0199999999995
Windows Millennium because it's the

5279.52 --> 5282.580000000001
newer one

5281.02 --> 5285.96
because they don't [ __ ] understand

5282.58 --> 5285.96
anything about anything

5290.98 --> 5295.299999999999
coming here for it corporate advice yeah

5293.26 --> 5297.400000000001
yeah you can do that you can come here

5295.3 --> 5299.52
for it corporate advice indeed if you

5297.4 --> 5299.5199999999995
like

5300.1 --> 5304.900000000001
no I'm in my own little world

5302.44 --> 5306.46
you work for a massive company yeah of

5304.9 --> 5308.44
course sure they're not gonna decide

5306.46 --> 5311.139
once they have it all running to all

5308.44 --> 5313.5
replace it for no reason mrpo I'm not an

5311.139 --> 5313.5
idiot

5318.639 --> 5323.26
like changing anything at that skill

5321.46 --> 5327.04
always sucks

5323.26 --> 5329.679
getting corporate the head or whatever

5327.04 --> 5332.98
to change everything on that scale

5329.679 --> 5334.9
already is a hassle so once it has

5332.98 --> 5337.78
changed they're never gonna ever change

5334.9 --> 5341.62
it back unless it all blows up I know

5337.78 --> 5344.199
how that works mfpo I I know how

5341.62 --> 5346.36
like managing networks and all that go

5344.199 --> 5347.98
I've known quite a few people that did

5346.36 --> 5350.62
that professionally

5347.98 --> 5355.0
including the Jesuit guy

5350.62 --> 5357.5199999999995
so yeah I know it's just that I simply

5355.0 --> 5360.699
would never like recommend oh we need to

5357.52 --> 5363.4800000000005
the latest Windows no you don't

5360.699 --> 5363.48
at all

5369.699 --> 5376.659
base and plug it on

5372.82 --> 5380.099999999999
so you can have the latest malware

5376.659 --> 5380.099999999999
yes MLP I know

5380.199 --> 5384.94
if you're up to date with the latest

5382.42 --> 5388.3
thingies you're also going to be up to

5384.94 --> 5391.178999999999
date with the latest viruses and hack

5388.3 --> 5393.820000000001
attempts and oh look new not new

5391.179 --> 5396.159
up-to-date thingies new up-to-date thing

5393.82 --> 5398.5599999999995
is which means they don't have proper

5396.159 --> 5400.599999999999
security yet so if you're up to date

5398.56 --> 5404.080000000001
with the newest thing is that means you

5400.6 --> 5406.42
can contract the newest computer viruses

5404.08 --> 5409.659
that'll [ __ ] your computer up hooray

5406.42 --> 5413.8
another advantage of being updated to

5409.659 --> 5413.799999999999
the newest version huh

5414.219 --> 5416.88
foreign

5419.679 --> 5422.679
games

5426.9 --> 5431.46
do you mean the newer games that suck

5432.1 --> 5436.54
sure they won't work

5434.139 --> 5439.36
I don't give a [ __ ] I don't need any

5436.54 --> 5442.659
game that doesn't work on Windows 7.

5439.36 --> 5446.739
I declare any game on a PC that doesn't

5442.659 --> 5450.699
work with Windows 7 sucks

5446.739 --> 5452.919999999999
it'll probably just drain the amount of

5450.699 --> 5455.259999999999
power it's going to drain running that

5452.92 --> 5456.95
on your computer will make the game suck

5455.26 --> 5458.92
enormously

5456.95 --> 5461.5599999999995
[Music]

5458.92 --> 5463.84
if a game doesn't run on Windows 7 then

5461.56 --> 5466.2390000000005
I'm not gonna play it I don't even want

5463.84 --> 5467.92
to play it I don't want to care about it

5466.239 --> 5470.379999999999
at all actually

5467.92 --> 5472.62
it's gonna be an energy wasting piece of

5470.38 --> 5472.62
[ __ ]

5479.58 --> 5485.86
oh software have got way more

5483.58 --> 5488.1
vulnerabilities vulnerabilities with

5485.86 --> 5488.099999999999
what

5491.52 --> 5496.6
you're completely wrong am appeal

5494.8 --> 5499.2390000000005
all the software

5496.6 --> 5500.320000000001
but more vulnerabilities yeah no older

5499.239 --> 5505.12
software

5500.32 --> 5507.88
has more up dates

5505.12 --> 5512.08
yeah that's the advantage of when

5507.88 --> 5514.42
something has been out for a while like

5512.08 --> 5516.34
a computer game or a piece of software

5514.42 --> 5518.5
yeah guess what happens when it's just

5516.34 --> 5520.0
new yeah you get all the updates oh it

5518.5 --> 5521.56
turns out there was a little error here

5520.0 --> 5524.32
all the book turns out it was a little

5521.56 --> 5527.139
hackable over there yeah yeah

5524.32 --> 5530.679
you don't have those issues when it's

5527.139 --> 5533.92
old yeah there's not gonna be new hack

5530.679 --> 5536.32
stuff on the old software no the new

5533.92 --> 5540.1
hack stuff gonna be on the new software

5536.32 --> 5542.799999999999
yeah that hasn't been properly immunized

5540.1 --> 5545.860000000001
against the hack stuff the old software

5542.8 --> 5548.139
has been properly immunized against the

5545.86 --> 5550.659
hack stuff and that's why old software

5548.139 --> 5553.12
is better because it's already been

5550.659 --> 5557.739
proved and tested and it's not going to

5553.12 --> 5561.4
be retargeted by new virus and hackers

5557.739 --> 5565.62
makers yeah that doesn't happen that's

5561.4 --> 5565.62
why it definitely works better

5566.38 --> 5573.1
yeah old software has been ironed out it

5570.34 --> 5577.360000000001
has been debugged it has been made proof

5573.1 --> 5581.639
against hacks and viruses

5577.36 --> 5581.639
that's real that's the reality of it

5583.239 --> 5586.599999999999
brand new software isn't automatically

5585.1 --> 5589.370000000001
vulnerable yeah but it is going to be

5586.6 --> 5591.120000000001
targeted though because it's brand new

5589.37 --> 5596.8
[Music]

5591.12 --> 5600.239
software is targeted because it's new

5596.8 --> 5600.2390000000005
they always try to do that

5605.32 --> 5608.32
okay

5610.659 --> 5616.9
no you're working it oh yes yes oh well

5614.199 --> 5619.419999999999
good for you you just keep updating the

5616.9 --> 5622.61
newest [ __ ] update don't complain to

5619.42 --> 5625.72
me about it okay

5622.61 --> 5625.719999999999
[Music]

5635.56 --> 5643.4800000000005
now I'd not realize I'm 20 years behind

5638.86 --> 5647.0199999999995
I just have a different approach

5643.48 --> 5649.54
yeah you go just work in your big Tech

5647.02 --> 5652.360000000001
world or whatever the [ __ ] it is and you

5649.54 --> 5654.76
go run your latest softwares and I know

5652.36 --> 5657.94
they're not going to settle for anything

5654.76 --> 5660.34
less because that's how that company is

5657.94 --> 5662.98
you don't have any say over it

5660.34 --> 5666.1
whatsoever I'm appeal yeah that's the

5662.98 --> 5667.86
big difference I'm not beholden to some

5666.1 --> 5672.1
Mega Corporation

5667.86 --> 5675.04
I can determine it for myself and my

5672.1 --> 5680.1990000000005
debt determination has led me to believe

5675.04 --> 5680.98
that I don't need the newer versions at

5680.199 --> 5684.759999999999
all

5680.98 --> 5687.339999999999
and then I have less problems with the

5684.76 --> 5690.900000000001
older versions yeah

5687.34 --> 5690.900000000001
is definitely true

5693.04 --> 5699.34
and yeah your policy will be different

5696.06 --> 5702.159000000001
oh there will be less issues oh this is

5699.34 --> 5705.52
oh yeah that's all very cute yeah but in

5702.159 --> 5708.4
reality I don't get viruses I don't get

5705.52 --> 5711.400000000001
hacked I don't have updates

5708.4 --> 5713.138999999999
and it like is like that it's not like

5711.4 --> 5714.638999999999
all blue well I haven't had anything in

5713.139 --> 5717.9400000000005
the last have you no I haven't had

5714.639 --> 5721.659000000001
anything in the last five years nothing

5717.94 --> 5723.339999999999
not a single [ __ ] issue

5721.659 --> 5725.199
except for a computer breaking because

5723.34 --> 5728.139
it basically got older and replaced and

5725.199 --> 5730.96
then still run nothing no issues no

5728.139 --> 5733.179
viruses no hacks nothing no files

5730.96 --> 5736.6
missing

5733.179 --> 5738.34
yeah I know what I'm talking about

5736.6 --> 5741.58
I am correct

5738.34 --> 5744.28
you don't have those options because you

5741.58 --> 5747.219
are beholden to a mega Corporation they

5744.28 --> 5749.08
are gonna do it their way you don't have

5747.219 --> 5751.9
any say in that

5749.08 --> 5754.84
because they are gonna follow their way

5751.9 --> 5758.379999999999
of doing things and you have to abide to

5754.84 --> 5761.1990000000005
that you can't do it your way

5758.38 --> 5765.219
unless it falls within the flexible

5761.199 --> 5768.78
parameters of what you are allowed to do

5765.219 --> 5768.78
in that Mega Corporation

5782.82 --> 5790.599999999999
modern like modern OS applications like

5787.48 --> 5793.54
what love fruit what

5790.6 --> 5797.6990000000005
what can't I run what am I missing out

5793.54 --> 5797.699
on that's so incredibly valuable

5799.9 --> 5804.04
foreign

5801.34 --> 5807.04
tell me what am I missing out on that's

5804.04 --> 5812.1
so incredibly valuable

5807.04 --> 5812.1
now I can only run on Windows 11.

5812.679 --> 5817.4800000000005
serious

5814.719 --> 5819.159
this is horse [ __ ] you you guys can't

5817.48 --> 5821.4
seriously believe what you're talking

5819.159 --> 5821.4
about

5829.3 --> 5835.78
like what a [ __ ] applications are so

5832.84 --> 5838.54
important that you'll spend thousands

5835.78 --> 5841.54
and thousands of dollars

5838.54 --> 5844.42
unlike the more I have to update the

5841.54 --> 5847.42
equipment to run the new windows because

5844.42 --> 5849.219
the new windows will require more so if

5847.42 --> 5850.96
we don't then we have to buy the new

5849.219 --> 5853.4800000000005
computer for the new windows or we can

5850.96 --> 5854.34
run the new application yeah sure it's

5853.48 --> 5856.959999999999
worth

5854.34 --> 5859.719
thousands and thousands per [ __ ]

5856.96 --> 5863.199
computer for the newest the newest

5859.719 --> 5865.54
little Gadget that you can run yeah

5863.199 --> 5867.58
or you just [ __ ] don't and you have

5865.54 --> 5871.06
the same computer and it still works and

5867.58 --> 5873.82
it'll work for decades without issues

5871.06 --> 5876.159000000001
and then you don't have the one [ __ ]

5873.82 --> 5878.38
little applications that's definitely

5876.159 --> 5882.9
not worth thousands and thousands of

5878.38 --> 5882.900000000001
dollars in new equipment and software

5893.26 --> 5899.62
oh yes yeah well maybe you should just

5896.5 --> 5903.159
work for advertisement then it's so

5899.62 --> 5904.9
great all the new version is so great oh

5903.159 --> 5907.179
yes

5904.9 --> 5909.4
you you're working in the advertisement

5907.179 --> 5911.58
Department mfuel

5909.4 --> 5914.379999999999
working in the advertisement

5911.58 --> 5917.76
because I'm not impressed

5914.38 --> 5917.76
I'm not impressed at all

5920.199 --> 5925.54
it's a massive Advantage advances are

5923.38 --> 5927.58
like what what's the [ __ ] massive

5925.54 --> 5929.98
Advance yeah

5927.58 --> 5933.04
I'm sure the ball Earth also made

5929.98 --> 5935.08
massive advances in the last few years

5933.04 --> 5937.239
I'm sure they did

5935.08 --> 5940.36
they can't actually say what it was

5937.239 --> 5943.718999999999
though yeah so what are the massive

5940.36 --> 5946.96
advances made in that field

5943.719 --> 5948.82
oh such a massive advancement such a

5946.96 --> 5951.159
massive advancement it's just everything

5948.82 --> 5954.04
became twice as expensive

5951.159 --> 5956.08
and even more because it's harder to get

5954.04 --> 5958.84
and and oh oh yeah you're gonna have to

5956.08 --> 5960.94
get some new debugging too oh it's not

5958.84 --> 5964.42
like we're not gonna give you issues

5960.94 --> 5967.36
because every new [ __ ] has issues

5964.42 --> 5970.43
definitely so much more advanced right

5967.36 --> 5970.429999999999
[Music]

5983.86 --> 5988.679
oh that's very cute love fruit good on

5986.5 --> 5988.679
you

5993.94 --> 5999.82
I don't run Android [ __ ] and I don't

5996.94 --> 6002.78
really need to run Linux so I just run

5999.82 --> 6002.78
Windows 7.

6003.48 --> 6007.218999999999
I can do all of that

6011.28 --> 6014.3
that's right Johnny

6022.679 --> 6029.0
video editing music recording software

6026.82 --> 6031.92
well there you have a point there Johnny

6029.0 --> 6033.36
I mean video editing is a pain in the

6031.92 --> 6036.0
ass

6033.36 --> 6038.94
on this computer but it like always was

6036.0 --> 6040.44
I mean it's just that it's it's kind of

6038.94 --> 6042.36
slow

6040.44 --> 6043.739
that's like one of the more annoying

6042.36 --> 6045.659
parts

6043.739 --> 6048.54
is that I would like to have video

6045.659 --> 6051.98
editing be a lot quicker but I mean I

6048.54 --> 6051.98
just don't do video editing

6053.42 --> 6059.58
but I mean I'm not I'm definitely not

6056.88 --> 6061.86
gonna upgrade Windows just because I

6059.58 --> 6064.8
want I want the option of a little bit

6061.86 --> 6066.9
quicker video editing yeah and risk

6064.8 --> 6069.56
destabilizing my entire computer no

6066.9 --> 6069.5599999999995
[ __ ] thanks

6070.86 --> 6074.88
no

6072.42 --> 6076.08
I'm not gonna go through all that [ __ ]

6074.88 --> 6078.719
again

6076.08 --> 6081.32
I got a thing that works I'm gonna keep

6078.719 --> 6081.32
it that way

6086.159 --> 6089.239
all right but I'm gonna round out the

6087.84 --> 6093.62
show

6089.239 --> 6093.62
what the hell am I gonna call this thing

6107.95 --> 6111.12
[Music]

6116.83 --> 6122.87
[Music]

6119.78 --> 6122.87
[Applause]

6130.8 --> 6133.34
all right

6146.159 --> 6150.32
all right so this is what it's going to

6148.08 --> 6150.32
be

6151.44 --> 6156.239
as a title it's not really what I talked

6154.32 --> 6159.119
about most I talked about it earlier but

6156.239 --> 6161.94
it is like still relevant

6159.119 --> 6164.699
and I'm rounding out now since none of

6161.94 --> 6167.759999999999
you are ever you're all like oh no Irwin

6164.699 --> 6170.04
is just old oh you're wrong or when oh

6167.76 --> 6172.02
you're gonna dip the newest version of

6170.04 --> 6173.94
the newest version yeah I don't give a

6172.02 --> 6175.8
[ __ ] it's really cute that you're all so

6173.94 --> 6179.58
professional and all that

6175.8 --> 6183.119000000001
but uh I don't need that at all

6179.58 --> 6185.94
like I will never need that

6183.119 --> 6188.099999999999
yeah and I never have update issues I

6185.94 --> 6189.96
never have one day oh my computer isn't

6188.1 --> 6193.26
working anymore because I'm [ __ ]

6189.96 --> 6195.4800000000005
around with updates yeah I never have

6193.26 --> 6198.5
that ever

6195.48 --> 6198.5
that's the difference

6205.02 --> 6209.219
right so thanks everyone for coming
