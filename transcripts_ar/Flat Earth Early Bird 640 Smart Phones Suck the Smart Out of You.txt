i i can't turn it back to the old format

141.84 --> 144.879

145.12 --> 148.239
i can't figure it out

148.8 --> 155.36
yeah it's not very nice i don't like it

152.72 --> 156.56
because i kind of like that the chat

155.36 --> 160.48000000000002

156.56 --> 160.48
ahead of time anyway

165.519 --> 171.84
let's see let's see the notes

179.36 --> 183.44000000000003
right yeah yes this flutter debate was

183.04 --> 186.79999999999998
live

183.44 --> 186.8
again of course uh

187.44 --> 194.5
nothing really special

191.36 --> 196.72000000000003
there's a lot of spur schema these days

194.5 --> 198.72
[Music]

196.72 --> 199.84
right also own benjamin's life again and

198.72 --> 202.959
he was

199.84 --> 203.44
basically showing off his piano in the

202.959 --> 206.879
barn

203.44 --> 210.84
that was pretty interesting looking

206.879 --> 214.239
very aesthetic uh

210.84 --> 216.31900000000002
right yeah okay like i said i would have

214.239 --> 219.36
watched rush hour one as well

216.319 --> 221.51899999999998
and yeah it wasn't

219.36 --> 225.44000000000003
all that great either but it did give a

221.519 --> 227.28
bit more background context to the setup

225.44 --> 229.2
which was extended upon in the third

227.28 --> 231.84
movie but not that

229.2 --> 233.35999999999999
outright expressed they got more sloppy

231.84 --> 236.48
very typical for a

233.36 --> 238.56
follow-up movie and a third kind

236.48 --> 242.959
but yeah i didn't i just don't really

238.56 --> 242.959
like it it's full of nonsense

243.29 --> 246.42999999999998
[Music]

246.879 --> 255.28
right i went pretty

250.72 --> 257.519
to bed pretty early i think

255.28 --> 259.44
yeah i'm not drinking wine anymore by

257.519 --> 261.28000000000003
the way

259.44 --> 263.199
it's uh like i'm trying to cut down on

261.28 --> 265.44
the alcohol it's also a response to the

263.199 --> 268.96000000000004
financial situation but it's also yeah

265.44 --> 272.639
the summer is kind of over

268.96 --> 272.63899999999995
i feel like i need to sober up

274.639 --> 278.24
it'll save me money you know

278.4 --> 284.79999999999995
and i know from practice

281.759 --> 287.91900000000004
that if you cut down on the alcohol

284.8 --> 290.24
you also things

287.919 --> 290.24
also

291.84 --> 295.28
i need less supplements when i do that

294.24 --> 298.16
just the need

295.28 --> 299.919
of it starts to go down so that'll be

298.16 --> 300.8
more efficient as well and yeah i'm

299.919 --> 302.79999999999995
doing it

300.8 --> 304.639
i'm just doing it you know i'm not going

302.8 --> 307.039
to be drinking when it's all this dreary

304.639 --> 307.039
anyway

307.44 --> 313.68
but anyway today there was iron works

311.28 --> 315.44
i was there we just went live it was

313.68 --> 318.56
kind of fun hanging around that same

315.44 --> 322.32
time spurs chemo was also live and i

318.56 --> 322.32
kind of hung around in chat there

322.8 --> 326.40000000000003
this is blabbering nick again with his

324.96 --> 328.63899999999995
wrench

326.4 --> 330.56
and it was just like at some point i

328.639 --> 333.28000000000003
just blocked him again because

330.56 --> 335.199
he was just lying it's like really

333.28 --> 337.84
wanted to make me

335.199 --> 339.199
bash his face in because he was just

337.84 --> 342.15999999999997
lying about

339.199 --> 343.6
about entropy second law of

342.16 --> 346.88000000000005
thermodynamics

343.6 --> 349.28000000000003
citing some crappy math website that

346.88 --> 352.639
didn't actually back his claim and just

349.28 --> 354.479
was so that guy's so incredibly

352.639 --> 358.08
disgusting

354.479 --> 360.96
just he's not like saying

358.08 --> 362.84
disgusting filthy things he's just such

360.96 --> 366.15999999999997
a

362.84 --> 369.67999999999995
unbelievable liar just

366.16 --> 371.6
demonic liar to himself too you know he

369.68 --> 373.28000000000003
has no control i have no doubt that he

371.6 --> 376.56
has no control whatsoever he

373.28 --> 377.039
is probably a registered pathological

376.56 --> 380.16
liar

377.039 --> 382.56
even outside of the internet what a

380.16 --> 383.28000000000003
disgusting guy so i blocked him again i

382.56 --> 387.12
don't

383.28 --> 387.11999999999995
i just don't want to even see him

392.84 --> 395.84
anymore

399.36 --> 404.8
right oh i forgot to make a note i also

401.68 --> 407.199
saw this really older

404.8 --> 409.039
hong kong movie i think i don't remember

407.199 --> 412.16
what the name was

409.039 --> 414.71999999999997
it was weird it was cartoonish

412.16 --> 416.56
but at least there was a lot of good

414.72 --> 417.199
spirit that was kind of the weird thing

416.56 --> 420.319
about it

417.199 --> 423.84000000000003
it was very much promoting morality

420.319 --> 426.56
and you have to defend your own people

423.84 --> 427.44
if for example the police are not

426.56 --> 431.12
helping out

427.44 --> 433.52
it was it was not of this age

431.12 --> 437.84000000000003
but i thought it was very fascinating to

433.52 --> 437.84
see that

440.08 --> 444.96
what's the name again just popped by and

443.759 --> 448.08000000000004
i clicked it

444.96 --> 448.08
i do that sometimes

448.96 --> 456.4
god i'm i'm really getting

452.479 --> 459.68
nauseated from this [ __ ] netflix

456.4 --> 460.56
constantly after every freaking thing i

459.68 --> 464.0
watch

460.56 --> 466.879
shoving that goddamn lucifer series

464.0 --> 467.599
in my face i'm so sick of it like [ __ ]

466.879 --> 470.16
off

467.599 --> 471.44
and like with youtube you can just say i

470.16 --> 473.91900000000004
don't want this

471.44 --> 475.599
you can't do that with netflix it's so

473.919 --> 478.08
aggravating

475.599 --> 478.8
so netflix is really starting to

478.08 --> 482.0
personally

478.8 --> 483.84000000000003
piss me off more and more you know

482.0 --> 487.52
and i'm not really watching their new

483.84 --> 487.52
series on average anyway

487.599 --> 492.0
just digging through it out of

489.52 --> 494.31899999999996
convenience through old movies most of

492.0 --> 494.319
the time

496.479 --> 501.44
so yeah netflix is completely just

498.639 --> 501.44
running out of

501.52 --> 508.15999999999997
viable grounds for me to

505.36 --> 508.16
to look through

509.44 --> 512.56
and i've been hearing that they've just

511.599 --> 517.12
been

512.56 --> 517.1199999999999
just this new freaking pedo [ __ ]

518.839 --> 521.839
series

523.919 --> 535.8389999999999
i don't want to know george sanford

538.56 --> 543.5999999999999
i don't want to know a single freaking

541.279 --> 545.4399999999999
detail about that series not a single

543.6 --> 547.2
freaking details i can already call

545.44 --> 550.32
exactly what it is

547.2 --> 554.32
he's a defiant all all-knowing

550.32 --> 554.32
whatever gamma [ __ ]

554.64 --> 558.16
it needs all the time i know it has to

557.2 --> 560.399
be something

558.16 --> 561.519
shitty like that i just don't want to

560.399 --> 564.24
know it

561.519 --> 564.24
don't want to know

568.08 --> 571.279
no i've never watched it never clicked

570.64 --> 574.399
it

571.279 --> 576.56
not even a single time always just get

574.399 --> 578.64
it out of my face

576.56 --> 591.8389999999999
and they keep on shoving it in there

578.64 --> 591.8389999999999
it's so disgusting

603.12 --> 608.9590000000001
yeah exactly mark color they want it

606.32 --> 611.2
they want everyone to be [ __ ]

608.959 --> 612.3199999999999
satanists and luciferians and to just

611.2 --> 615.839
declare it

612.32 --> 617.6
that's what they want that's what they

615.839 --> 620.24
they're trying to push through and

617.6 --> 622.399
really the the older moves is just like

620.24 --> 625.279
a consolidation price it's it's

622.399 --> 628.0
really just like the tv it it has

625.279 --> 629.279
netflix has just become the internet tv

628.0 --> 632.8
like that

629.279 --> 634.88
tv does that [ __ ] all the time

632.8 --> 637.76
you what you would put on the tv because

634.88 --> 639.4399999999999
you wanted to watch this program

637.76 --> 640.959
and then you get the advertisement

639.44 --> 643.12
shoved in your face

640.959 --> 645.5189999999999
it's just as disgusting if not worse and

643.12 --> 646.5600000000001
then in between stupid news flashes or

645.519 --> 650.5600000000001
whatever

646.56 --> 652.56
with more disgusting [ __ ] it's the same

650.56 --> 654.7199999999999
except with netflix they shove

652.56 --> 657.5189999999999
disgusting

654.72 --> 661.44
satanic programming [ __ ] in your face

657.519 --> 664.24
instead of the advertisement

661.44 --> 664.24
that's the difference

671.36 --> 678.399
you can stop netflix suggesting unwanted

674.32 --> 678.399
shows oh really how do you do that tiny

686.839 --> 692.5600000000001
wumble

689.12 --> 695.76
yeah yeah i sure i do have a potty mouth

692.56 --> 697.92
i do indeed when it's called for when i

695.76 --> 699.519
am truly repulsed by something

697.92 --> 701.8389999999999
disgusting i will

699.519 --> 705.279
i will start to use those type of words

701.839 --> 705.2790000000001
everything has a time and a place

713.839 --> 718.24
yeah on the mobile app no i don't even

715.839 --> 720.9590000000001
have a mobile tiny wombo

718.24 --> 722.24
you should know that by now i don't have

720.959 --> 727.68
a mobile with

722.24 --> 727.6800000000001
internet and [ __ ] never have never will

727.839 --> 733.6
i have a telephone you can call

730.959 --> 734.7199999999999
with it and send and receive text

733.6 --> 737.6800000000001
messages

734.72 --> 739.44
that's what a phone is that's what i got

737.68 --> 742.6389999999999
i don't have a freaking

739.44 --> 745.2790000000001
tracking device computer brain

742.639 --> 745.76
leech that i carry with me all day and

745.279 --> 759.8389999999999
stare

745.76 --> 759.8389999999999
into i don't have that

773.12 --> 777.36
i know tiny womble and how i described

776.8 --> 780.639
is

777.36 --> 780.639
it is what i call it

781.2 --> 787.839
a mobile tracking leech that's what

784.0 --> 787.839
that's what that is

790.88 --> 801.8389999999999
it sucks the smart right out of you

817.279 --> 820.959
in the netherlands we call it a mobile

819.04 --> 822.8
as well i

820.959 --> 824.88
i don't like to call it that because

822.8 --> 827.279
that to me would imply

824.88 --> 829.36
like it is a standard necessary thing or

827.279 --> 833.199
something

829.36 --> 833.1990000000001
like a telephone and it's not

834.399 --> 838.959
it's a mobile tracking leech and it

837.68 --> 843.8389999999999
sucks the smart

838.959 --> 843.8389999999999
right out of you

854.839 --> 857.839
so

877.839 --> 884.1600000000001
older self no that it it's just another

881.279 --> 888.88
type of device

884.16 --> 888.88
they had no touch screen phone

889.92 --> 899.199
with buttons you know like a small

893.199 --> 902.959
keyboard remember buttons

899.199 --> 902.959
but the button is the screen

908.16 --> 913.8389999999999
no not a flip phone

938.839 --> 944.9590000000001
hmm

940.639 --> 947.279
anyway so anything you guys want me to

944.959 --> 950.399
talk about today before

947.279 --> 950.399
yeah it's already halfway

950.959 --> 955.8389999999999
before i go back on the flat earth

953.04 --> 955.8389999999999
debates again

971.759 --> 977.04
talking on phones you know you know

974.959 --> 980.3199999999999
there's still people out there just

977.04 --> 981.279
everyone out there still walking on the

980.32 --> 986.72
street

981.279 --> 986.72
talking in their mobile those idiots

987.36 --> 993.12
you know and i'm so sick of it

990.399 --> 993.519
because these people in 10 years 20

993.12 --> 995.6
years

993.519 --> 997.04
however long you know what they're gonna

995.6 --> 999.0400000000001
do something i don't know they're gonna

997.04 --> 1000.959
take a vaccine they're gonna

999.04 --> 1002.959
eat it a little extra shitty they're

1000.959 --> 1004.6389999999999
gonna take some risky drugs at some

1002.959 --> 1008.6389999999999
point in the party

1004.639 --> 1008.639
and then yeah they're gonna just

1009.199 --> 1015.199
get brain cancer or something else or

1012.16 --> 1018.16
leukemia i don't know man

1015.199 --> 1019.519
and then they're going to be like but me

1018.16 --> 1022.0
poor me

1019.519 --> 1023.92
i just did what everyone told me except

1022.0 --> 1025.919
i didn't read the instructions on the

1023.92 --> 1027.839
mobile phone that tells you you have to

1025.919 --> 1030.959
keep it away from your head

1027.839 --> 1033.12
one meter at all times

1030.959 --> 1034.88
right then they're gonna expect that

1033.12 --> 1039.839
yeah the people are just gonna

1034.88 --> 1039.8390000000002
tax pay their medical bills

1040.4 --> 1053.8400000000001
that's what's gonna happen i'm so sick

1042.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
of it

1058.72 --> 1062.48
yeah that's right my smart my phone is

1060.88 --> 1067.8400000000001
not a smartphone i keep

1062.48 --> 1067.84
the smarts to myself

1080.96 --> 1085.6000000000001
you know phone talk already enough

1083.679 --> 1086.96
people out there talking on phone so we

1085.6 --> 1089.6789999999999
don't have to talk about them

1086.96 --> 1092.08
talking on phones as well i agree tom

1089.679 --> 1092.0800000000002
parker

1092.84 --> 1095.84
uh

1106.16 --> 1112.48
all right uh mark color besides phones

1109.6 --> 1115.039
it's also just this annoying habit of

1112.48 --> 1117.76
constantly blabbering all the time while

1115.039 --> 1121.52
doing other things at the same time

1117.76 --> 1125.36
that habit it's like a metropolitan

1121.52 --> 1125.36
typical urban type of habit

1125.52 --> 1129.6
that habit is terrible it's like those

1128.559 --> 1133.36
people

1129.6 --> 1135.36
can't just sit do something in silence

1133.36 --> 1138.7199999999998
they're always freaking blabbering

1135.36 --> 1140.3999999999999
getting distracted and [ __ ]

1138.72 --> 1142.559
that's not very healthy either you know

1140.4 --> 1143.679
it's a form of escapism constantly

1142.559 --> 1146.24
blabbering

1143.679 --> 1148.0
it's to escape the silence there's

1146.24 --> 1148.72
something to escape from for those

1148.0 --> 1151.919
people

1148.72 --> 1152.559
and they constantly do that [ __ ] they

1151.919 --> 1156.0800000000002
also

1152.559 --> 1156.08
don't listen a lot of the time

1162.72 --> 1166.48
what what is it tiny womble i'm not

1165.039 --> 1170.48
pissed off at you i'm just

1166.48 --> 1172.559
pissed off and i'm not that pissed off

1170.48 --> 1174.88
it's just i'm annoyed by a lot of things

1172.559 --> 1175.6
and it's i guess it's bubbling up again

1174.88 --> 1177.2
today

1175.6 --> 1180.48
maybe it's because i'm wearing a black

1177.2 --> 1180.48
shirt again oh god

1180.799 --> 1184.48
now it's more likely just the weather

1182.64 --> 1187.2800000000002
it's shitty

1184.48 --> 1188.4
and also my back is getting a lot better

1187.28 --> 1192.24
i did some

1188.4 --> 1195.52
special exercises and it's still

1192.24 --> 1197.76
slightly stiff but i can like i feel it

1195.52 --> 1199.28
but i can effectively do everything now

1197.76 --> 1201.679
without

1199.28 --> 1202.96
like having to be scared and certainly

1201.679 --> 1204.88
like oh [ __ ]

1202.96 --> 1207.1200000000001
something like that it's that i'm past

1204.88 --> 1209.2800000000002
that stage but when that happens when

1207.12 --> 1211.4399999999998
you heal up

1209.28 --> 1213.52
everything from the outside starts to

1211.44 --> 1214.039
pile on again after you've basically

1213.52 --> 1216.6399999999999
been

1214.039 --> 1217.6
preoccupied for a while purely fixating

1216.64 --> 1220.4
on your own body

1217.6 --> 1222.48
because that distracts you and then this

1220.4 --> 1223.3600000000001
typically happens it's like ah [ __ ] the

1222.48 --> 1226.64
world again

1223.36 --> 1228.32
ah this is you know so that's where

1226.64 --> 1228.72
that's coming from don't worry tiny one

1228.32 --> 1233.12
was

1228.72 --> 1236.4
not about about what you said

1233.12 --> 1236.3999999999999
more than usual anyway

1241.28 --> 1246.799
well tom parker it i don't know

1244.32 --> 1248.559
it's just after two days ago roughly

1246.799 --> 1250.08
just seemed like

1248.559 --> 1252.08
and i looked at the weather prediction

1250.08 --> 1253.12
that the whole temperature situation has

1252.08 --> 1255.12
just gone down

1253.12 --> 1257.6
and doesn't look like it's gonna you

1255.12 --> 1260.4799999999998
know at the end the summer end of august

1257.6 --> 1262.3999999999999
this is almost the end of august the

1260.48 --> 1263.76
temperature goes down all of a sudden

1262.4 --> 1267.6000000000001
like that with the weather it's

1263.76 --> 1269.039
very rare it goes back up again

1267.6 --> 1271.84
although it has happened you know we

1269.039 --> 1273.2
have had pretty sunny septembers here as

1271.84 --> 1275.039
well a couple of years ago

1273.2 --> 1276.64
i think which year was that i don't

1275.039 --> 1279.44
remember

1276.64 --> 1280.96
so but it's very unlikely after the the

1279.44 --> 1284.96
hot summer we had

1280.96 --> 1284.96
for such a long time no less so

1286.32 --> 1291.84
strong winds over there nice white shot

1288.84 --> 1291.84
okay

1331.039 --> 1334.08
get a late summer still yeah look i'm

1333.6 --> 1336.3999999999999
not

1334.08 --> 1338.8799999999999
completely excluding a tiny bomb but i'm

1336.4 --> 1342.4
just saying after this long prolonged

1338.88 --> 1344.3200000000002
hot summer over here at least just seems

1342.4 --> 1361.8400000000001
unmore likely that it's gonna get

1344.32 --> 1361.84
hot again it rarely does you know

1367.2 --> 1372.64
all right also yeah from

1373.44 --> 1376.88
from the news output out there i'm

1375.84 --> 1382.48
getting a lot of

1376.88 --> 1386.24
agitation porn articles concerning

1382.48 --> 1388.96
yeah forced vaccinations like they're

1386.24 --> 1389.76
i don't know they're at least saying it

1388.96 --> 1392.08
they're like

1389.76 --> 1393.679
spreading the word around and like the

1392.08 --> 1396.559
un is making statements

1393.679 --> 1397.919
like bill gates like yeah everybody has

1396.559 --> 1400.1589999999999
to

1397.919 --> 1402.88
be vaccinated and it's going to be

1400.159 --> 1406.0800000000002
enforced by the military that [ __ ]

1402.88 --> 1406.0800000000002
is being spreader it's like

1407.44 --> 1414.159
it is they're really putting the tension

1410.799 --> 1416.1589999999999
on it they are although

1414.159 --> 1417.8400000000001
it's not really clear whether there it's

1416.159 --> 1421.7600000000002
just a bluff or not it just

1417.84 --> 1421.76
seems too insane to be real

1423.12 --> 1430.3999999999999
so i don't know yeah what is gonna

1428.84 --> 1432.6399999999999
happen

1430.4 --> 1434.24
is it just going to be that bluff that

1432.64 --> 1435.2
they're going to be dangling over our

1434.24 --> 1438.559
heads until

1435.2 --> 1442.24
enough people just commit suicide or die

1438.559 --> 1444.799
by stress is that the plan

1442.24 --> 1446.64
just fake it until enough people die

1444.799 --> 1449.84
from stressing out

1446.64 --> 1450.159
is that the plan i don't get it because

1449.84 --> 1451.9189999999999
if

1450.159 --> 1453.5200000000002
any of that is literally going to happen

1451.919 --> 1455.44
like everything is going to be

1453.52 --> 1457.279
pretty much over like there's no going

1455.44 --> 1459.3600000000001
to be

1457.279 --> 1461.679
everything is going to be completely

1459.36 --> 1464.8799999999999
dispelled

1461.679 --> 1467.6000000000001
and going to implode

1464.88 --> 1473.8400000000001
including them including their stupid

1467.6 --> 1473.84
little bunkers

1475.2 --> 1477.44
so

1480.64 --> 1487.8400000000001
what do you guys think

1511.2 --> 1517.2
you guys agree is it just a bluff a

1514.799 --> 1520.24
giant bluff to try to agitate

1517.2 --> 1522.64
people to death is that's what is that

1520.24 --> 1525.84
what they're doing

1522.64 --> 1527.679
besides the economic crackdown like

1525.84 --> 1529.1999999999998
they just bluff and agitate enough

1527.679 --> 1532.48
people they are

1529.2 --> 1535.679
basically voluntarily by the panic

1532.48 --> 1537.1200000000001
or by greed or whatever they are going

1535.679 --> 1539.6000000000001
to self sabotage

1537.12 --> 1541.1999999999998
and with that sabotage the society

1539.6 --> 1542.32
around them is is that what they're

1541.2 --> 1544.799
doing

1542.32 --> 1546.799
is that literally what it is is that all

1544.799 --> 1548.559
it is

1546.799 --> 1549.6
or is any of this what they're bluff

1548.559 --> 1550.559
what they're saying what they're

1549.6 --> 1552.559
blabbering about

1550.559 --> 1555.2
forced vaccination and all just this

1552.559 --> 1558.8799999999999
[ __ ] is is that really gonna happen

1555.2 --> 1559.919
how would that ever happen without just

1558.88 --> 1563.2
completely

1559.919 --> 1571.039
ravaging entire

1563.2 --> 1574.64
world stability beyond repair

1571.039 --> 1575.679
and why would any group go along with

1574.64 --> 1578.4
that

1575.679 --> 1579.44
you know like the controllers the the

1578.4 --> 1581.679
richest people

1579.44 --> 1582.799
maybe because they had fallback

1581.679 --> 1584.72
positions

1582.799 --> 1586.799
bunkers whatever you know i could

1584.72 --> 1589.52
imagine that but people like

1586.799 --> 1590.24
the military whatever and there's lots

1589.52 --> 1593.679
of them

1590.24 --> 1596.799
of all kinds how would they

1593.679 --> 1598.4
to themselves just justify like yeah we

1596.799 --> 1603.2
are basically just

1598.4 --> 1607.679
ravaging and euthanizing just everyone

1603.2 --> 1610.72
that includes well

1607.679 --> 1614.159
lots of people they know

1610.72 --> 1617.6000000000001
maybe even family

1614.159 --> 1617.6000000000001
i i just can't imagine

1618.72 --> 1627.84
that they'd let it go beyond anything

1621.6 --> 1627.84
but a bluff

1628.159 --> 1632.88
oh tom parker well i don't know i'm

1631.2 --> 1635.1200000000001
hearing things you know in the bigger

1632.88 --> 1638.72
cities like then hague and amsterdam

1635.12 --> 1641.36
there seems to be some stupid

1638.72 --> 1642.799
social distancing mass reinforcement

1641.36 --> 1647.039
going on

1642.799 --> 1650.0
but it's it's worse in other countries

1647.039 --> 1653.279
i think of course other countries are a

1650.0 --> 1656.0
lot bigger than the netherlands but

1653.279 --> 1657.44
but i personally have not been

1656.0 --> 1659.52
approached or

1657.44 --> 1669.679
confronted about any mask or social

1659.52 --> 1672.32
distancing nonsense

1669.679 --> 1673.76
yeah and besides i personally don't i

1672.32 --> 1676.96
naturally don't like

1673.76 --> 1680.84
getting in people's space anyway

1676.96 --> 1683.8400000000001
you know that was even before all this

1680.84 --> 1683.84
nonsense

1688.799 --> 1694.1589999999999
all right yeah well from what i

1692.24 --> 1697.279
understand i haven't tried it out yet

1694.159 --> 1700.88
don't really care to at this point

1697.279 --> 1703.6
the train system

1700.88 --> 1704.72
the train the rail network in the

1703.6 --> 1707.279
netherlands

1704.72 --> 1708.72
that that is basically a company

1707.279 --> 1711.52
monopolized company

1708.72 --> 1714.48
great and they are demanding that you're

1711.52 --> 1714.48
gonna wear a mask

1715.039 --> 1724.96
i find that extremely aggravating

1719.84 --> 1728.1589999999999
and i'm basically boycotting it

1724.96 --> 1731.039
okay like really okay well

1728.159 --> 1731.0390000000002
go bust them

1737.039 --> 1741.039
it's just brilliant building up this

1739.52 --> 1744.08
advanced train system

1741.039 --> 1746.64
improving the situation expanding

1744.08 --> 1747.76
everything and then doing this [ __ ] it's

1746.64 --> 1753.8400000000001
not gonna help

1747.76 --> 1753.84
provably so self-sabotage terrible

1764.84 --> 1767.9189999999999
right but maybe that is what it is you

1767.52 --> 1771.2
know

1767.919 --> 1774.3990000000001
maybe they just want to cut

1771.2 --> 1777.6000000000001
social systems like

1774.399 --> 1779.6789999999999
uh so yeah organizations that assist

1777.6 --> 1782.799
people

1779.679 --> 1785.6000000000001
like transport maybe they just want it

1782.799 --> 1785.6
to go bust

1790.559 --> 1794.0
and in that case if that were the case

1792.559 --> 1797.12
then i guess that

1794.0 --> 1799.52
the managers directors of those

1797.12 --> 1800.799
companies should be held criminally

1799.52 --> 1803.84
accountable

1800.799 --> 1806.399
for conspiracy criminal conspiracy

1803.84 --> 1810.32
against the people

1806.399 --> 1813.279
but yeah for no good reason

1810.32 --> 1814.08
not based on any scientific evidence or

1813.279 --> 1817.279
anything

1814.08 --> 1823.84
real yeah

1817.279 --> 1823.84
letting their company implode

1826.08 --> 1829.279
i think they should be held accountable

1828.399 --> 1830.7199999999998
you know

1829.279 --> 1833.44
just because they're managing the

1830.72 --> 1836.0
company or even if they own the company

1833.44 --> 1838.159
it's an integrated thing there's people

1836.0 --> 1840.48
working there depending on it

1838.159 --> 1842.7990000000002
it has a function people rely on that if

1840.48 --> 1844.48
you're going to sabotage it

1842.799 --> 1846.48
you should be held accountable because

1844.48 --> 1851.84
it's not just your thing

1846.48 --> 1851.84
no if you want to sell it sure

1852.0 --> 1856.64
if you're going to actively sabotage it

1854.32 --> 1857.76
by this kind of rules you should be held

1856.64 --> 1860.7990000000002
accountable

1857.76 --> 1862.559
should be punishable

1860.799 --> 1864.1589999999999
if you're going to sabotage a company

1862.559 --> 1867.36
like that that has

1864.159 --> 1879.8400000000001
bigger function on which large large

1867.36 --> 1879.84
amounts of people rely

1897.36 --> 1899.6
all right

1900.799 --> 1907.84
you know it's just so crazy the whole

1904.84 --> 1907.84
situation

1912.399 --> 1917.9189999999999
especially because well the the supposed

1915.84 --> 1919.519
communists

1917.919 --> 1921.76
you can't even call them communists

1919.519 --> 1926.3990000000001
anymore they're literally just

1921.76 --> 1928.1589999999999
corporate psychopath drones rather

1926.399 --> 1930.399
because it's not even about people or

1928.159 --> 1933.1200000000001
society anymore it's just about

1930.399 --> 1934.1589999999999
pure mind control and destroying all

1933.12 --> 1938.0
opposition at

1934.159 --> 1941.6000000000001
all cost that's not communism really

1938.0 --> 1945.44
it's just it's just

1941.6 --> 1948.8799999999999
demonic but yeah back in the day

1945.44 --> 1950.88
i was kind of liberal i sort of dreamed

1948.88 --> 1952.0
along with the idea of oh we should all

1950.88 --> 1955.519
come together

1952.0 --> 1958.88
like a more normal communism

1955.519 --> 1960.72
you know from an innocent perspective

1958.88 --> 1962.5590000000002
i just thought like yeah that is how i

1960.72 --> 1963.279
function too i want to defend all of

1962.559 --> 1967.12
humanity

1963.279 --> 1969.12
you know like that well there seemed to

1967.12 --> 1970.7199999999998
be plenty of people around back then

1969.12 --> 1973.9189999999999
that felt the same

1970.72 --> 1978.159
so they're now just all

1973.919 --> 1982.3990000000001
ignoring it and just letting these

1978.159 --> 1986.72
tyrannical maniacs terrorize

1982.399 --> 1989.76
imprison and sabotage

1986.72 --> 1989.76
the whole place up

1989.84 --> 1994.8799999999999
so is it yeah

1996.0 --> 2003.2
well the supposed communist groups

1999.2 --> 2006.24
are literally just fascist sympathizers

2003.2 --> 2009.2
they're societal destroyers destroyers

2006.24 --> 2009.2
of common sense

2009.84 --> 2016.9599999999998
agitators only destroying only

2013.36 --> 2019.1999999999998
breaking down and then maybe some of

2016.96 --> 2021.2
them in their heads really think that

2019.2 --> 2024.0
at the end of it if there is such a

2021.2 --> 2026.24
thing something new will be built

2024.0 --> 2027.679
but they have only ever seen proof of

2026.24 --> 2029.519
destruction

2027.679 --> 2030.88
from their own side so why would you

2029.519 --> 2033.36
even believe that

2030.88 --> 2035.1200000000001
and besides among them are plenty of

2033.36 --> 2036.799
people they'll just say no we're just

2035.12 --> 2038.399
here to destroy the world

2036.799 --> 2040.1589999999999
and then you may look at them like that

2038.399 --> 2041.36
sounds quite crazy isn't that a bit over

2040.159 --> 2044.8400000000001
the top

2041.36 --> 2049.12
bypassing that they mean it

2044.84 --> 2049.12
okay so

2050.639 --> 2054.48
why are these people stuck in these

2052.72 --> 2058.0
groups not scattering

2054.48 --> 2061.52
not reorganizing bypassing their

2058.0 --> 2064.079
demonic captors and

2061.52 --> 2065.2
starting up from a new angle making it

2064.079 --> 2067.679
real again

2065.2 --> 2069.04
let's make things real again you know

2067.679 --> 2072.96
i'm not opposed to

2069.04 --> 2076.24
idealist leftist type thinkers

2072.96 --> 2077.119
as long as they just don't politicize to

2076.24 --> 2080.24
a demonic

2077.119 --> 2082.3990000000003
level you know they make arguments

2080.24 --> 2083.6789999999996
sure maybe stupid arguments in some

2082.399 --> 2086.24
cases

2083.679 --> 2087.44
but at least it comes from an honest

2086.24 --> 2089.839
idea

2087.44 --> 2089.839
in ways

2090.56 --> 2094.7999999999997
if there's even people like that left by

2092.72 --> 2096.1589999999997
now if they haven't all just corrupted

2094.8 --> 2098.48
purely in this

2096.159 --> 2100.839
we're gonna win it doesn't matter

2098.48 --> 2103.839
anymore what we say because we're gonna

2100.839 --> 2103.839
win

2114.839 --> 2117.839
mania

2128.839 --> 2131.839
ugh

2133.44 --> 2137.2000000000003
oh hey tom parker but maybe before you

2136.0 --> 2141.2
just call him an idiot

2137.2 --> 2141.2
why don't you just ask him why

2141.28 --> 2145.8390000000004
why did he wear a mask

2149.2 --> 2159.839
here yeah spray painting oh wait that's

2152.079 --> 2159.8390000000004
you mystical

2164.4 --> 2171.119
no planet earthling that's not real

2168.0 --> 2176.079
covet doesn't kill anything

2171.119 --> 2180.88
it's a side effect covet is

2176.079 --> 2180.88
the symptom it's not the cause

2182.0 --> 2186.079
viruses come into being when the body

2185.359 --> 2189.7599999999998
calls for

2186.079 --> 2192.8
it the body calls for it

2189.76 --> 2195.8390000000004
when it gets the signal that it should

2192.8 --> 2200.0
call for it and that is often triggered

2195.839 --> 2203.119
by detection of the presence of that

2200.0 --> 2205.28
state of that sickness state in others

2203.119 --> 2206.2400000000002
it'll give a signal through your

2205.28 --> 2208.96
subconscious

2206.24 --> 2210.3999999999996
to uh to a cellular on a cellular level

2208.96 --> 2212.96
telling your body yeah

2210.4 --> 2214.88
maybe you should do this too then it's

2212.96 --> 2216.64
going to check up on the condition of

2214.88 --> 2220.48
your body if there is enough

2216.64 --> 2222.72
junk left over that requires cleanup

2220.48 --> 2224.64
that would be cleaned up with the

2222.72 --> 2229.839
sickness process

2224.64 --> 2232.56
and then it will trigger

2229.839 --> 2233.599
no planet earthling it does there's a

2232.56 --> 2236.64
lot of tests of

2233.599 --> 2240.0
testifying and literal

2236.64 --> 2244.72
on camera experimentation

2240.0 --> 2247.119
on camera spread around that it is

2244.72 --> 2248.16
so you're wrong planet earthling you're

2247.119 --> 2251.2000000000003
wrong

2248.16 --> 2254.64
wearing a mask does cause hypoxia

2251.2 --> 2257.839
it does proven

2254.64 --> 2257.839
stop fooling yourself

2263.33 --> 2267.179
[Music]

2269.69 --> 2272.909
[Music]

2274.72 --> 2282.9599999999996
no measured measured

2278.4 --> 2285.359
take an oxygen meter outside air

2282.96 --> 2287.599
shows you a level then you put it in

2285.359 --> 2291.04
between your mask

2287.599 --> 2294.1600000000003
it shows a lower level yes yes it does

2291.04 --> 2294.56
on camera proven stop lying to yourself

2294.16 --> 2298.3199999999997
stop

2294.56 --> 2303.2799999999997
trying to fool my audience

2298.32 --> 2303.28
a mask causes hypoxia it does proven

2307.2 --> 2313.839
shove those masks up your ass

2319.76 --> 2323.119
if you want to wear them by all means

2322.72 --> 2326.7999999999997
you know

2323.119 --> 2329.44
me just put them all over yourself like

2326.8 --> 2332.079
turn yourself into a masked mummy so we

2329.44 --> 2335.28
can't see a single piece of your skin

2332.079 --> 2337.92
just cover yourself in masks do it

2335.28 --> 2340.32
you'll be safe we'll be safe from you

2337.92 --> 2355.839
because you'd be dead

2340.32 --> 2355.839
go ahead

2357.52 --> 2361.359
yeah yeah that's right michael rook but

2360.56 --> 2364.56
it is done

2361.359 --> 2367.359
in a very specific setup because

2364.56 --> 2369.839
just general oxygen deprivation is not

2367.359 --> 2369.839
good for you

2370.4 --> 2374.4
because you need oxygen up to certain

2373.359 --> 2376.4
levels for

2374.4 --> 2379.76
well for your body to function in its

2376.4 --> 2382.2400000000002
base function but also to repair

2379.76 --> 2397.2000000000003
situation to maintain its oxygen is

2382.24 --> 2400.16
required for bodily maintenance

2397.2 --> 2402.56
yeah yeah that's right tiny womble you

2400.16 --> 2405.2
know why that is

2402.56 --> 2407.52
because they don't wear them all day

2405.2 --> 2407.52
long

2407.92 --> 2414.4
they only put them on when they go

2411.359 --> 2416.72
into surgery

2414.4 --> 2416.7200000000003
duh

2419.76 --> 2426.6400000000003
and hey yeah you can just go about with

2422.88 --> 2429.2000000000003
slightly lower oxygen for a short time

2426.64 --> 2431.2
but only a short time because after a

2429.2 --> 2434.24
while it starts to pile up and then it

2431.2 --> 2434.24
becomes unhealthy

2437.52 --> 2442.88
and by the way gasping for air is not

2440.4 --> 2446.0
typically caused by oxygen deprivation

2442.88 --> 2448.0
it's caused by carbon dioxide pollution

2446.0 --> 2449.2
by not being able to get rid of the

2448.0 --> 2451.599
carbon dioxide

2449.2 --> 2454.24
the concentration will be too high if

2451.599 --> 2456.96
you're breathing in recycled air

2454.24 --> 2459.7599999999998
with the co2 and that is typically what

2456.96 --> 2462.8
causes people

2459.76 --> 2467.8390000000004
yeah causes them to physically gasp

2462.8 --> 2467.8390000000004
for air not oxygen deprivation

2468.0 --> 2481.839
oxygen deprivation just tires you out

2485.599 --> 2490.1600000000003
don't be such a victim tiny wumble i'm

2488.48 --> 2495.839
not just responding to you okay there's

2490.16 --> 2495.839
some other people in chat here as well

2508.8 --> 2514.0
right yeah

2511.92 --> 2515.52
getting sick human body is put through

2514.0 --> 2518.48
so much pollution breathe

2515.52 --> 2518.48
it in yo

2518.64 --> 2523.839
wait that's not what i wanted somebody

2520.88 --> 2523.839
said about

2523.92 --> 2527.92
it yeah it doesn't not a lot of not

2526.24 --> 2529.839
physical demanding work

2527.92 --> 2533.2000000000003
a lot of it yes surgery it's not

2529.839 --> 2537.2799999999997
physical it requires concentration

2533.2 --> 2540.48
because hey they're gasping for error

2537.28 --> 2542.88
physical work is not really because you

2540.48 --> 2545.28
require oxygen again it's because you

2542.88 --> 2548.48
need to get rid of the co2

2545.28 --> 2550.48
the extra co2 caused by the

2548.48 --> 2552.8
burning of glucose in the muscles

2550.48 --> 2555.68
causing co2

2552.8 --> 2556.319
again it's the co2 really that drives

2555.68 --> 2559.5989999999997
the most

2556.319 --> 2559.599
impulses of breathing

2559.68 --> 2564.319
it's non-oxygen again oxygen deprivation

2563.92 --> 2567.44
just

2564.319 --> 2579.839
tires you out if you have excess oxygen

2567.44 --> 2579.839
then you'll get dizzy and lightheaded

2582.48 --> 2586.56
right adam i got that right right you

2585.2 --> 2593.839
should you know this

2586.56 --> 2593.839
probably better than most his details

2596.079 --> 2598.88
hey man you

2599.599 --> 2607.839
julio pavin

2616.079 --> 2623.119
all right look

2619.44 --> 2624.7200000000003
that that is just that can't be right

2623.119 --> 2629.04
what you're saying

2624.72 --> 2632.839
you're not wearing a mask all day long

2629.04 --> 2635.839
it's just nonsense planet earthling no

2632.839 --> 2635.839
way

2646.839 --> 2649.839
so

2650.4 --> 2666.319
yeah get the [ __ ] out

2662.8 --> 2668.079
yeah planet earthling likes to basically

2666.319 --> 2669.7599999999998
throw out there i don't know virtue

2668.079 --> 2672.8
signaling did your

2669.76 --> 2673.3590000000004
medical investment company tell you to

2672.8 --> 2676.96
do this

2673.359 --> 2680.4
did they recommend you do this to try to

2676.96 --> 2683.839
dispel the notion that wearing a mask

2680.4 --> 2686.88
for prolonged periods causes hypoxia

2683.839 --> 2689.04
were you told to do this oh you worked

2686.88 --> 2690.2400000000002
in surgery did you oh did you wear the

2689.04 --> 2691.92
mask all day long

2690.24 --> 2693.68
or did you just put it on when you go

2691.92 --> 2695.2000000000003
into surgery and when you get out of it

2693.68 --> 2698.319
you take it off again

2695.2 --> 2701.5989999999997
planet everything like i said

2698.319 --> 2705.839
so are you lying hm

2701.599 --> 2705.839
are you

2715.68 --> 2719.839
hours at a time sure

2724.4 --> 2728.7200000000003
and then when you got out of surgery did

2727.2 --> 2731.2799999999997
you take off the mask

2728.72 --> 2733.839
did you keep wearing it the entire

2731.28 --> 2733.8390000000004
working day

2735.44 --> 2740.96
i bet you've had a if you've really been

2737.839 --> 2742.72
part of surgery i'm sure you'd have

2740.96 --> 2744.56
certain times when you'd wear it be

2742.72 --> 2745.2
wearing it for a pretty long time in a

2744.56 --> 2749.7599999999998
very

2745.2 --> 2749.7599999999998
slow surgery situation right

2749.92 --> 2752.079
but

2753.359 --> 2759.7599999999998
yeah that is still going to cause

2756.72 --> 2762.0
hypoxia though maybe you're very

2759.76 --> 2763.3590000000004
tolerant on low oxygen levels maybe you

2762.0 --> 2765.44
function well some people

2763.359 --> 2768.0789999999997
function a little bit better with low

2765.44 --> 2769.839
oxygen levels than others

2768.079 --> 2771.599
those are also the same people that

2769.839 --> 2772.64
would typically make great mountain

2771.599 --> 2776.8
climbers

2772.64 --> 2779.68
that's real it's official no

2776.8 --> 2781.04
people deal with oxygen levels and air

2779.68 --> 2784.0789999999997
and their overall lung

2781.04 --> 2788.88
function differently

2784.079 --> 2792.079
but in general on average wearing a mask

2788.88 --> 2795.119
for a long period causes hypoxia it's

2792.079 --> 2797.44
proven it lowers the oxygen levels now

2795.119 --> 2799.04
if you deal fine with lower oxygen

2797.44 --> 2801.68
levels good on you

2799.04 --> 2802.96
but on average people don't handle that

2801.68 --> 2804.72
too well

2802.96 --> 2806.64
and the condition that it causes when

2804.72 --> 2808.319
you don't handle it too well is called

2806.64 --> 2812.0
hypoxia

2808.319 --> 2814.16
so hey if you're hypoxia immune

2812.0 --> 2816.16
naturally because of the way your body

2814.16 --> 2820.24
is designed well good for you

2816.16 --> 2823.359
it's very nice but it does

2820.24 --> 2825.04
on average cause hypoxia to wear a mask

2823.359 --> 2828.4
for prolonged periods

2825.04 --> 2831.04
and the direct reason for it is very

2828.4 --> 2831.92
obvious and proven it directly

2831.04 --> 2834.48
measurably

2831.92 --> 2836.4
on camera proven lowers the oxygen

2834.48 --> 2839.04
levels

2836.4 --> 2839.04
and that's that

2842.839 --> 2845.839
so

2850.319 --> 2854.4
right and you get extra co2 as well

2852.72 --> 2855.2
although i haven't seen that measured

2854.4 --> 2858.559
you know

2855.2 --> 2862.5589999999997
and extra co2 is not called hypoxia

2858.559 --> 2873.8390000000004
i think not should not be

2862.559 --> 2873.8390000000004
it's not oxygen so

2885.2 --> 2891.68
hmm all right mark collard well i'm not

2888.4 --> 2893.839

2891.68 --> 2895.5989999999997
if i'd had to wear a mask i would feel

2893.839 --> 2899.599
it very quickly

2905.359 --> 2907.68
