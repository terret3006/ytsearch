called

114.399 --> 122.0
after i watch your ad

117.6 --> 124.24
yep hey at least uh it's skippable only

122.0 --> 125.52
i made sure that just like the

124.24 --> 127.92
unskippable ads

125.52 --> 128.959
are not in there anyway the the weather

127.92 --> 130.66
today is

128.959 --> 132.48
different again

130.66 --> 136.72
[Music]

132.48 --> 138.64
it's kind of cold this is constant

136.72 --> 140.64
slow breeze going on but it's pretty

138.64 --> 141.11999999999998
cold it's water cold it feels and yeah

140.64 --> 142.95899999999997
it's

141.12 --> 144.31900000000002
totally gray now up there as you

142.959 --> 146.16
everyone can see

144.319 --> 148.319
quite a contrast with yesterday wasn't

146.16 --> 148.319
it

152.08 --> 156.64000000000001
but at least it is dry except for well

155.92 --> 171.83999999999997
the water

156.64 --> 171.83999999999997
in the air i think

174.959 --> 185.84
yeah in the netherlands we regard this

177.12 --> 185.84
as second christmas day

190.879 --> 198.39999999999998
so i'm looking forward to going

195.36 --> 200.72000000000003
i'm kind of new samson are you oh

198.4 --> 200.72
right

202.64 --> 206.159
yeah zack sterling is kind of new hey

204.56 --> 213.84
julio pepin

206.159 --> 213.84
good to see you

214.92 --> 218.04
[Music]

218.799 --> 226.0
hey [ __ ] wuzzle yeah i got your comment

222.239 --> 229.36
you watched my uh rectangular looping

226.0 --> 231.28
flat earth hangout from way back

229.36 --> 233.43900000000002
wrote wrote a really good comment on it

231.28 --> 241.84
i appreciate that

233.439 --> 241.84
hey mark with melbourne too

243.92 --> 247.92
right yeah and i thought it was

245.439 --> 249.68
interesting to hear your memory of how

247.92 --> 253.35999999999999
it was back then

249.68 --> 254.4
because you know i've been through all

253.36 --> 256.88
of it

254.4 --> 258.959
but a lot of things that were seemingly

256.88 --> 260.239
very important and preoccupying back

258.959 --> 262.56
then

260.239 --> 265.35999999999996
it's kind of a little difficult for me

262.56 --> 268.32
sometimes to remember everything

265.36 --> 270.16
although if i just completely watch a

268.32 --> 273.04
hangout from beginning to end not just

270.16 --> 275.199
trying to pick out certain subjects

273.04 --> 276.56
then i will probably catch on again but

275.199 --> 279.84000000000003
to me it seems like

276.56 --> 283.36
well literally like things are already

279.84 --> 286.4
overcame so they're just

283.36 --> 288.639
old things to me

286.4 --> 289.919
and yeah because of that i don't really

288.639 --> 292.479
get into how it was

289.919 --> 294.84
back then too much unless it is relevant

292.479 --> 297.12
in some kind of psychological

294.84 --> 298.63899999999995
explanation

297.12 --> 300.16
but it's good to hear somebody else

298.639 --> 304.16
getting into that

300.16 --> 306.08000000000004
on that level your link has been spammed

304.16 --> 306.56
and pinned on the debates oh okay thank

306.08 --> 308.96
you

306.56 --> 308.96
nathan

309.68 --> 313.759
watching ads again oh

314.16 --> 318.08000000000004
i guess christmas live streams in the

316.56 --> 322.08
morning are very

318.08 --> 326.4
rare maybe i don't know how many people

322.08 --> 328.4
are streaming live right now on average

326.4 --> 330.4
but i think that like nobody really

328.4 --> 333.52
wants to get up super early and do a

330.4 --> 333.52
live stream in the us

335.919 --> 339.84
most people are probably still going to

337.759 --> 343.28000000000003
be preoccupied with family unless they

339.84 --> 345.75899999999996
all went away in the evening but

343.28 --> 345.75899999999996
i don't know

348.8 --> 353.84000000000003
hey robin stanley good morning

355.919 --> 360.24
all right so yeah i chose the title of

359.36 --> 363.91900000000004
the show today

360.24 --> 368.40000000000003
downward biases for the dance obviously

363.919 --> 370.0
referring also to the uh

368.4 --> 371.84
to the flat earth debate show that

370.0 --> 374.8
nathan premiered

371.84 --> 374.79999999999995
i think twice

375.199 --> 382.56
in the afternoon and in the evening

378.8 --> 384.56
and it was that show where yeah um

382.56 --> 385.6
nathan thompson in which it gets it gets

384.56 --> 388.24
uh get on

385.6 --> 389.68
and it's really weird because i hear

388.24 --> 392.72
myself

389.68 --> 394.639
in that show too commenting but

392.72 --> 396.8
here's the little easter egg like i

394.639 --> 398.479
didn't realize it was which it gets it

396.8 --> 399.759
and nathan thompson

398.479 --> 401.84
because the times that they were

399.759 --> 403.68
actually addressed by name i think i was

401.84 --> 405.75899999999996
like making lunch or something it's a

403.68 --> 407.44
really weird situation

405.759 --> 409.039
i wasn't fully present in the whole

407.44 --> 410.88
thing so i didn't really know it was

409.039 --> 411.919
wits it gets it or nathan thompson i was

410.88 --> 415.199
just

411.919 --> 417.35999999999996
like their voices there are many people

415.199 --> 419.91900000000004
out there that have very similar

417.36 --> 424.8
sounding voices so i thought it was just

419.919 --> 426.71999999999997
two other ballers i didn't realize

424.8 --> 429.52000000000004
because if you listen to it as if they

426.72 --> 432.72
were ballers then it just is typically

429.52 --> 437.599
rumpussy behavior and

432.72 --> 439.59900000000005
yeah it was weird

437.599 --> 441.28999999999996
super ad blocker nathan no don't do ad

439.599 --> 443.28
blocker

441.29 --> 447.199
[Music]

443.28 --> 447.19899999999996
because the ads do help my stats

448.8 --> 454.0
my google income and that keeps the

452.0 --> 455.919
government off my back

454.0 --> 459.44
because i'm in social welfare so please

455.919 --> 459.44
don't do do ad blocker

462.639 --> 466.96000000000004
you know i have only skippable ads so

464.72 --> 472.40000000000003
you should be able to

466.96 --> 476.71999999999997
click through them in under a minute

472.4 --> 476.71999999999997
or in under a half a minute every time

477.759 --> 480.8
what is it eight seconds or how does it

479.68 --> 484.56
work eleven seven

480.8 --> 487.199
anyway it's all skippable

484.56 --> 488.479
yes yeah i don't wanna burden everybody

487.199 --> 490.84000000000003
that much and besides

488.479 --> 492.24
the non-skippable ads are the most

490.84 --> 494.08
insufferable

492.24 --> 495.919
always every time i notice this i pay

494.08 --> 498.479
attention to that sort of [ __ ] and the

495.919 --> 500.0
the long ones are usually like for

498.479 --> 503.199
alcohol

500.0 --> 504.479
some strong drink or using some really

503.199 --> 506.24
terrible song

504.479 --> 508.08
that you can't skip it's like i've

506.24 --> 509.199
noticed this so i'm trying to spare you

508.08 --> 512.24
all that

509.199 --> 521.839
so there's only skippable ads

512.24 --> 521.839
hope you appreciate that

522.159 --> 529.76
be very wary of bob no oh my god

526.0 --> 533.76
be afraid of the cave troll

529.76 --> 536.16
stomping in i am not really that afraid

533.76 --> 539.279
you know what has happened has happened

536.16 --> 539.279
the cave troll basically

539.6 --> 544.16
just became more forward about what he

542.959 --> 547.5999999999999
does

544.16 --> 550.0
and so my tension was that i would get

547.6 --> 552.399
the full wrath of that

550.0 --> 553.2
and i don't want to i don't want a war

552.399 --> 556.72
like it's just

553.2 --> 560.08
personally i don't it's not

556.72 --> 561.2
useful but i always but i kind of demand

560.08 --> 562.9590000000001
from myself or

561.2 --> 564.88
it's not even demanding it's like i need

562.959 --> 568.56
to

564.88 --> 571.8389999999999
speak the truth about situations and

568.56 --> 572.3199999999999
be honest about how i size up things i

571.839 --> 577.2790000000001
must

572.32 --> 580.24
do that it's a matter of integrity

577.279 --> 581.36
on a very spiritual level like i must be

580.24 --> 584.32
honest

581.36 --> 585.76
about that and that yeah certain people

584.32 --> 587.36
that are trying to portray there

585.76 --> 590.88
something else

587.36 --> 593.2
might be very afraid of that

590.88 --> 595.6
so but now it's all out in the open the

593.2 --> 599.2
situation is already

595.6 --> 602.8000000000001
beyond me just getting the full

599.2 --> 605.839
attack from well you know who so

602.8 --> 605.8389999999999
it's okay

607.04 --> 611.76
it just happened it needed to happen for

609.04 --> 611.76
a long time

611.839 --> 615.7600000000001
and yeah i don't know

616.24 --> 619.519
it can still go in all kinds of

617.76 --> 621.36
directions but there's all there's

619.519 --> 622.48
already like several people that have

621.36 --> 624.8000000000001
now

622.48 --> 626.8000000000001
yeah it it sounds so ridiculous but they

624.8 --> 630.7199999999999
have kind of chosen sites

626.8 --> 633.04
chosen sites you can see it and it's so

630.72 --> 635.8000000000001
silly because people are just getting

633.04 --> 638.8
caught up into

635.8 --> 639.68
polarization once again and they let

638.8 --> 644.079
their

639.68 --> 644.079
behavioral and their attitudes slip

644.839 --> 650.32
people

647.279 --> 652.24
because of a perceived opponent they

650.32 --> 656.0790000000001
allow themselves to

652.24 --> 660.399
basically take on bad traits or make

656.079 --> 662.4799999999999
huge accomplishing mistakes

660.399 --> 664.88
with the polarization effect because

662.48 --> 665.6
that happens and that part is really

664.88 --> 668.56
embarrassing

665.6 --> 670.0790000000001
it like it is very embarrassing it's

668.56 --> 673.3599999999999
also why

670.079 --> 675.5999999999999
the guys among ourselves we do

673.36 --> 677.519
get really strict with one another to

675.6 --> 679.12
not let it slip

677.519 --> 681.2
when we notice that about each other

679.12 --> 685.2
because we know

681.2 --> 685.2
very well how important that is

685.6 --> 691.76
to stay to keep the integrity

688.64 --> 694.72
to stay to the facts and not get

691.76 --> 696.64
polarized not get distracted by things

694.72 --> 699.839
that annoy us about the opponent

696.64 --> 703.8389999999999
within the argument and go at home

699.839 --> 703.839
all try to avoid that

708.079 --> 714.88
ps5 ads huh yeah everybody gets ad

711.76 --> 718.24
that that well

714.88 --> 719.76
google things are things are appropriate

718.24 --> 721.279
for them

719.76 --> 724.399
like what are they interested what have

721.279 --> 726.8
they bought recently oh there you go

724.399 --> 728.32
so the ps5 ad i could easily explain

726.8 --> 730.16
it's like yeah you've been having a

728.32 --> 733.12
computer breakdown

730.16 --> 735.519
and again and again so it thinks well

733.12 --> 737.68
maybe you should try the ps5

735.519 --> 740.24
it can do everything too oh it

737.68 --> 742.56
completely restricts and sensor [ __ ]

740.24 --> 745.279
well they don't tell you about that but

742.56 --> 747.5189999999999
you will not have as much of a breakdown

745.279 --> 747.519
right

750.56 --> 757.5189999999999
yeah there the the advertisement

753.68 --> 758.16
direction is that smart it is really

757.519 --> 761.12
smart

758.16 --> 763.1999999999999
really well informed through metadata

761.12 --> 764.72
extremely well informed so they really

763.2 --> 768.0
know

764.72 --> 771.12
it's a smart salesman if you think about

768.0 --> 774.16
how they plan these things right but

771.12 --> 777.92
it's also very manipulative

774.16 --> 777.92
these salesmen have an agenda

778.399 --> 782.16
they all play into the beast like all

781.12 --> 784.839
try to corral

782.16 --> 787.8389999999999
people towards directions with their ads

784.839 --> 787.839
yeah

790.79 --> 793.9499999999999
[Music]

798.839 --> 804.48
anyway

801.279 --> 804.48
what are you guys talking about

807.6 --> 812.399
are youtube red okay

813.6 --> 817.0400000000001
well i think there are like special

815.68 --> 820.399
youtube

817.04 --> 822.7199999999999
versions where yeah

820.399 --> 824.959
it's built in that it doesn't that it

822.72 --> 829.839
skips ads

824.959 --> 829.8389999999999
like a fee to skip the ads

832.079 --> 836.56
so they either get fee from the ads or

834.48 --> 838.399
they get a fee from the people that

836.56 --> 841.04
specifically paid not to get the ads

838.399 --> 844.0
which is kind of a sensible system

841.04 --> 844.0
if you think about it

847.92 --> 851.36
but yeah people that subscribe to skip

850.0 --> 854.399
the ads

851.36 --> 856.8000000000001
they yeah they don't help the person

854.399 --> 858.88
that actually gets

856.8 --> 860.079
on the channel that gets the fee from

858.88 --> 862.16
the ads you see so

860.079 --> 863.68
just youtube and google just gets the

862.16 --> 866.88
full amount for that

863.68 --> 870.959
just realize that when you

866.88 --> 874.639
go for such a decision anyway

870.959 --> 874.6389999999999
enough about youtube ads

875.6 --> 879.1990000000001
you can download music and phone

881.12 --> 888.88
all right all right

884.8 --> 892.24
but it's fine i've i've been thinking

888.88 --> 894.8
about doing it myself but

892.24 --> 895.6
i've actually become kind of captivated

894.8 --> 899.199
interested

895.6 --> 900.16
in the ads not as in what they're trying

899.199 --> 903.12
to sell me but

900.16 --> 905.279
rather as what type of ads i'm

903.12 --> 906.9590000000001
interested in

905.279 --> 908.399
in the wizard as it were it's like i

906.959 --> 910.2399999999999
know he's trying to trick me but i'm

908.399 --> 911.12
kind of curious as to how he's going to

910.24 --> 915.04
trick me

911.12 --> 918.079
this is i can't help it

915.04 --> 921.12
so i'm actually for not turning it off

918.079 --> 923.68
myself because

921.12 --> 926.399
yeah when i feel str like when i feel

923.68 --> 927.04
very bad about myself or weak or lost or

926.399 --> 929.68
miserable

927.04 --> 930.48
then the ads are a real nuisance but

929.68 --> 932.7199999999999
when i feel

930.48 --> 935.279
rather strong it can be kind of

932.72 --> 935.279
interesting

935.759 --> 938.9590000000001
just to see like what are they trying

938.639 --> 941.12
and

938.959 --> 942.2399999999999
with that also what is the level of what

941.12 --> 946.48
is out there what is

942.24 --> 949.519
seen as the norm for manipulation levels

946.48 --> 952.88
how blatant are they how much

949.519 --> 955.92
covertness is in there

952.88 --> 959.4399999999999
and if so how much on average is left

955.92 --> 963.759
of that in because like yeah how much

959.44 --> 966.1600000000001
is overt how much is covert you see

963.759 --> 968.399
so yeah when i feel strong suddenly it

966.16 --> 971.8389999999999
becomes an opportunity for study

968.399 --> 971.839
instead of just a nuisance

975.519 --> 979.519
and hey at least on youtube you can skip

978.639 --> 982.5600000000001
them

979.519 --> 983.199
you know on the tv you could never skip

982.56 --> 986.8
the ads

983.199 --> 986.8
now that's annoying

988.21 --> 991.32
[Music]

993.839 --> 999.36
i can't remember last time i saw a car

996.32 --> 999.36
or alcohol ad

1001.759 --> 1004.9590000000001
well with me the i did get remember last

1004.24 --> 1006.9590000000001
time i

1004.959 --> 1008.56
uh when was it yesterday's show i don't

1006.959 --> 1009.199
remember exactly when it was but i

1008.56 --> 1012.16
talked about

1009.199 --> 1013.3599999999999
alcohol for a bit like when i talk about

1012.16 --> 1016.8
alcohol habits and

1013.36 --> 1019.12
and such or even when i

1016.8 --> 1022.16
not live on air but just over a skype

1019.12 --> 1024.959
call tell somebody like ah

1022.16 --> 1026.24
at this moment i do really miss drinking

1024.959 --> 1029.439
for this in this reason

1026.24 --> 1029.839
well guess what next ad strong alcohol

1029.439 --> 1032.88
oh

1029.839 --> 1035.76
party yeah serious that happened

1032.88 --> 1037.6000000000001
it's like oh thanks thanks youtube i'm

1035.76 --> 1039.199
glad you're paying attention to things i

1037.6 --> 1042.7199999999998
don't publicly do

1039.199 --> 1046.4
for your ads that doesn't feel creepy at

1042.72 --> 1050.24
all so it knows

1046.4 --> 1051.2
it just knows but anyway i really

1050.24 --> 1054.48
haven't drunk

1051.2 --> 1057.6000000000001
i but i did have uh

1054.48 --> 1059.2
was it two days ago i was really

1057.6 --> 1061.28
standing in front of like the

1059.2 --> 1063.28
the beer in the supermarket and thinking

1061.28 --> 1067.44
like can i have like a drink for

1063.28 --> 1069.44
for christmas just like oh that just the

1067.44 --> 1072.0
the moment of fun again but then i

1069.44 --> 1074.4
realized oh [ __ ] no no no no

1072.0 --> 1075.2
no i shouldn't especially shouldn't do

1074.4 --> 1078.88
it

1075.2 --> 1080.72
like i need to just linger

1078.88 --> 1083.3600000000001
instead of getting that alcohol touch

1080.72 --> 1085.44
because then things will change again

1083.36 --> 1086.9599999999998
and probably for the worse i reasoned

1085.44 --> 1090.0
this out

1086.96 --> 1090.0
so i just didn't do it

1091.2 --> 1094.88
and i think i'm not going to do it for a

1093.679 --> 1096.799
long time like

1094.88 --> 1099.2800000000002
it's become a challenge to me to just

1096.799 --> 1102.72
not drink because i don't really need it

1099.28 --> 1107.2
and i should be thanking my lucky stars

1102.72 --> 1110.08
if that's yep that it's not that bad

1107.2 --> 1110.4
the need for it back i should be lucky

1110.08 --> 1113.9189999999999
now

1110.4 --> 1115.6000000000001
when you don't feel it you it's not like

1113.919 --> 1117.3600000000001
in your normal consciousness you don't

1115.6 --> 1119.52
feel that lucky because it's not

1117.36 --> 1120.4799999999998
influencing that much but i remember the

1119.52 --> 1122.08
times that i did

1120.48 --> 1124.4
really long for it because i felt really

1122.08 --> 1127.28
miserable for other reasons like

1124.4 --> 1127.2800000000002
my accent [ __ ]

1127.6 --> 1133.9189999999999
so i should realize i am lucky to not

1130.799 --> 1133.9189999999999
that have that need

1134.84 --> 1141.039
right

1137.679 --> 1143.1200000000001
and then not just wander off and take it

1141.039 --> 1144.32
for granted and then think oh whoa i

1143.12 --> 1145.9189999999999
don't need it that much

1144.32 --> 1147.84
let's just drink again because then it

1145.919 --> 1150.96
might change around right

1147.84 --> 1152.08
it's very good to kind of consciously

1150.96 --> 1165.8400000000001
think about this

1152.08 --> 1165.84
in such moments

1175.36 --> 1180.32
right talking about it few minutes

1177.36 --> 1183.76
beforehand and then devices

1180.32 --> 1188.1599999999999
stand by no apps well

1183.76 --> 1188.16
were she talking over the phone

1188.72 --> 1193.84
or just in the room

1195.2 --> 1199.039
and when you were talking in the room

1196.799 --> 1202.96
was somebody's phone

1199.039 --> 1205.679
in the room because especially like the

1202.96 --> 1221.44
smartphones the internet cable once they

1205.679 --> 1224.88
just pick up everything

1221.44 --> 1224.88
no just in the room okay

1225.36 --> 1229.76
yeah both are defined well there you go

1227.679 --> 1232.88
yeah if you have your mobile with you

1229.76 --> 1249.84
or in the room yeah of course

1232.88 --> 1249.8400000000001
it's one of their primary functions

1251.919 --> 1258.48
it's creepy okay

1255.28 --> 1261.28
well i have very elaborate conversations

1258.48 --> 1266.24
on my non-smartphone

1261.28 --> 1266.24
and i don't get as much effect from that

1268.08 --> 1271.9189999999999
it like it obvious it does not feel

1270.72 --> 1275.679
rigged

1271.919 --> 1277.6000000000001
to do that to listen in as much

1275.679 --> 1280.48
it's really like i can't compare it to

1277.6 --> 1281.76
the influences on ads and everything

1280.48 --> 1284.559
because i do have very elaborate

1281.76 --> 1287.84
conversations sometimes

1284.559 --> 1289.2
but the funny thing is we i talked about

1287.84 --> 1292.24
it with my friend

1289.2 --> 1293.3600000000001
it's a while back now uh over in

1292.24 --> 1296.64
naimeira

1293.36 --> 1299.36
she does have a smartphone and she

1296.64 --> 1301.2800000000002
actually says like yeah after the last

1299.36 --> 1303.1999999999998
time we talked about this and this i got

1301.28 --> 1306.559
all these ads and it happened to

1303.2 --> 1308.88
really be helpful and give her

1306.559 --> 1310.1589999999999
a good suggestion that was funny but she

1308.88 --> 1311.0390000000002
noticed like yeah we had this

1310.159 --> 1314.159
conversation

1311.039 --> 1314.1589999999999
and then i got this

1314.64 --> 1320.159
so yeah it's very obvious i did not

1317.919 --> 1323.3600000000001
because i don't have a smartphone

1320.159 --> 1323.3600000000001
so that stood out

1326.08 --> 1330.24
but when i do things over the computer

1330.84 --> 1337.76
then it does pick that

1333.76 --> 1338.24
up seriously so it's like okay i have

1337.76 --> 1340.799
skype

1338.24 --> 1342.08
conversations well they're not private

1340.799 --> 1345.039
not really

1342.08 --> 1346.08
they're private for regular people but

1345.039 --> 1349.12
it's very obvious

1346.08 --> 1352.48
that i don't know machine

1349.12 --> 1355.039
uh in yeah information grabbers and all

1352.48 --> 1358.159
that can reach into it

1355.039 --> 1361.52
so i think that skype does actually just

1358.159 --> 1365.7600000000002
hand or sell or hand out its metadata

1361.52 --> 1365.76
of all the users i think serious

1365.84 --> 1375.84
so i try to take that into account

1384.0 --> 1387.44
i don't care if they listen to me

1386.08 --> 1390.0
talking to my cat

1387.44 --> 1390.0
or dog

1392.24 --> 1396.799
or did you know that your smartphone can

1394.96 --> 1399.919
just pick up

1396.799 --> 1400.48
sounds that dogs or cats make and then

1399.919 --> 1403.5200000000002
give you

1400.48 --> 1406.159
food ads for them even

1403.52 --> 1417.84
because it just figures out oh you're

1406.159 --> 1417.8400000000001
you got a dog or you got a cat

1421.679 --> 1432.4
where do i go to get saved uh

1430.4 --> 1434.96
well is there something specific you

1432.4 --> 1438.0
need to be saved from

1434.96 --> 1438.4
because if you just want to do the right

1438.0 --> 1441.36
thing

1438.4 --> 1442.88
if you want to attune to christ or

1441.36 --> 1446.32
however you're going to see that

1442.88 --> 1448.7990000000002
just decide that and realize the

1446.32 --> 1451.279
existential consequences and then

1448.799 --> 1454.0
you it's it's a decision on a much

1451.279 --> 1454.0
bigger scale

1456.0 --> 1462.159
that you do that and then you start

1459.2 --> 1462.159
working things out

1466.96 --> 1470.72
starting to feel fear after learning so

1469.12 --> 1473.76
much truth so fast well

1470.72 --> 1476.24
maybe you should reconsider because

1473.76 --> 1477.84
lots of truth usually doesn't yield that

1476.24 --> 1480.559
much fear

1477.84 --> 1482.9599999999998
and there it look it's it's over just

1480.559 --> 1487.9189999999999
very complicated

1482.96 --> 1492.32
and fear is often comes from

1487.919 --> 1495.1200000000001
having a interpretation that is not

1492.32 --> 1495.84
full that is still on a lower level and

1495.12 --> 1498.1589999999999
then you

1495.84 --> 1500.0
yeah you start to focus on other kinds

1498.159 --> 1503.1200000000001
of mechanics and consequences and then

1500.0 --> 1503.52
fear might arrive from that because the

1503.12 --> 1506.799
full

1503.52 --> 1507.84
truth like one of my realizations in

1506.799 --> 1509.84
general is just

1507.84 --> 1511.76
never to think anything that i come

1509.84 --> 1514.08
across to be the full truth

1511.76 --> 1515.2
not because it intends to manipulate me

1514.08 --> 1518.3999999999999
but because

1515.2 --> 1521.2
the full truth is just extremely

1518.4 --> 1522.5590000000002
rare and does not show itself publicly

1521.2 --> 1526.32
as much

1522.559 --> 1529.84
it's really hard to attain absolute pure

1526.32 --> 1529.84
sources of anything

1535.76 --> 1543.08
you've just found oh right well right

1540.08 --> 1544.48
well there you go but that is a over

1543.08 --> 1547.6789999999999
dramaticizing

1544.48 --> 1548.559
approach to say everything is a lie it's

1547.679 --> 1550.96
just that

1548.559 --> 1553.2
the truth is extremely hard to attain

1550.96 --> 1556.799
and a lie is only a lie

1553.2 --> 1560.32
if you know it to be false

1556.799 --> 1562.48
you see that's where it becomes

1560.32 --> 1566.1589999999999
complicated almost like a

1562.48 --> 1566.48
a quantum exploration of uncertainty

1566.159 --> 1569.5200000000002
like

1566.48 --> 1572.88
are they lying well you can tell if

1569.52 --> 1575.44
you they're symptoms of lying attitude

1572.88 --> 1576.96
symptoms of lying that are very become

1575.44 --> 1579.76
very apparent

1576.96 --> 1579.76
if you study it

1580.4 --> 1584.0800000000002
versus people that are just echoing

1583.679 --> 1587.3600000000001
things

1584.08 --> 1590.48
that they think are true

1587.36 --> 1592.7199999999998
it has a very different symptoms

1590.48 --> 1594.88
and you'll find out that most people do

1592.72 --> 1598.08
that the second

1594.88 --> 1598.96
like real liars are relatively rare it's

1598.08 --> 1604.1589999999999
just that people

1598.96 --> 1604.159
echo on a lot of [ __ ] they do it a lot

1604.88 --> 1608.64
most people do that literally most

1607.12 --> 1612.559
people

1608.64 --> 1613.919
most people in media they just try to

1612.559 --> 1617.2
echo the right

1613.919 --> 1620.24
things that they think are true that'll

1617.2 --> 1622.48
or that'll touch

1620.24 --> 1624.24
most people sometimes people aren't even

1622.48 --> 1626.08
concerned with whether it's true

1624.24 --> 1628.4
it's just like they think it's popular

1626.08 --> 1630.799
so they say it that happens too

1628.4 --> 1632.72
does that make them active liars no

1630.799 --> 1634.48
because they haven't actually bothered

1632.72 --> 1635.679
to figure out whether it is the truth or

1634.48 --> 1641.84
not

1635.679 --> 1641.8400000000001
ah yeah it's complicated

1657.07 --> 1660.26
[Music]

1662.08 --> 1667.52
right yeah

1665.12 --> 1669.84
yeah the creation part and the

1667.52 --> 1672.96
ontological primitives are for me

1669.84 --> 1673.84
like the anchor point that really

1672.96 --> 1677.1200000000001
dispels

1673.84 --> 1680.24
most doubts and confusion

1677.12 --> 1683.84
it's like a strong physical

1680.24 --> 1683.84
logical reminder

1700.88 --> 1704.88
do you feel like it's all chinese what

1705.679 --> 1725.18
what is jenny

1711.52 --> 1730.019
what do you mean zack sterling

1725.18 --> 1730.019
[Music]

1733.26 --> 1736.39
[Music]

1741.76 --> 1744.72
okay

1745.279 --> 1750.08
i don't know what that means [ __ ] was

1750.84 --> 1753.84
all

1765.44 --> 1772.3200000000002
commune with the creator that's a little

1768.559 --> 1772.32
baby a little overreaching there

1777.279 --> 1784.0
the communing with christ

1780.88 --> 1794.3200000000002
with like the spirit of the creator but

1784.0 --> 1809.36
the creator himself i don't know

1794.32 --> 1812.8799999999999
or just being a twad right

1809.36 --> 1814.399
yeah i don't know what some 139 is

1812.88 --> 1817.279
either

1814.399 --> 1818.32
would be kind of helpful if somebody

1817.279 --> 1824.08
actually

1818.32 --> 1824.08
told me if they bring it up

1826.0 --> 1831.12
like i i don't even normally know how to

1829.44 --> 1833.44
look up this thing every time somebody

1831.12 --> 1837.6789999999999
says that i'd have to like re-figure out

1833.44 --> 1840.24
on how to find that every time so

1837.679 --> 1841.44
i'm always like this like okay can you

1840.24 --> 1843.52
tell me which page

1841.44 --> 1845.6000000000001
it is but and then i realized oh wait it

1843.52 --> 1848.48
doesn't really

1845.6 --> 1850.1589999999999
work like that and i find it very

1848.48 --> 1853.3600000000001
difficult to explore

1850.159 --> 1853.3600000000001
the bible on average

1858.799 --> 1865.84
you're what you're emotional

1862.159 --> 1869.1200000000001
why all right

1865.84 --> 1872.1589999999999
because you basically had some

1869.12 --> 1873.84
more shocking realizations well just try

1872.159 --> 1876.3200000000002
not to

1873.84 --> 1878.24
that yeah with that confrontation it's

1876.32 --> 1881.76
just very important

1878.24 --> 1885.2
to realize what i said that like

1881.76 --> 1887.36
there's a real difference between just

1885.2 --> 1889.6000000000001
yeah spouting nonsense not really

1887.36 --> 1892.9599999999998
realizing it's nonsense

1889.6 --> 1896.32
and lying it's a big difference like

1892.96 --> 1899.039
lying really is a sin but just

1896.32 --> 1900.559
echoing nonsense is not a sin it's just

1899.039 --> 1902.799
foolishness

1900.559 --> 1904.399
and there's a lot of foolishness with

1902.799 --> 1908.0
people

1904.399 --> 1908.0
a lot everybody has it

1910.32 --> 1916.799
like i've tried to remove as much

1914.399 --> 1917.84
foolishness on this level from myself as

1916.799 --> 1920.799
i can

1917.84 --> 1923.9189999999999
it like you do still notice the impulses

1920.799 --> 1925.76
way back in the beginning

1923.919 --> 1928.0
i've really tried to take that out to

1925.76 --> 1931.679
just remove all the

1928.0 --> 1931.679
things that i don't know for sure

1932.159 --> 1937.2
that i have strong feelings about like i

1933.84 --> 1941.6789999999999
even had that with gravity myself

1937.2 --> 1944.799
just you gotta figure it out get honest

1941.679 --> 1945.6000000000001
and the honesty because every time you

1944.799 --> 1948.399
research

1945.6 --> 1949.36
something big there's a big chance that

1948.399 --> 1952.6399999999999
it's going to

1949.36 --> 1953.279
break the dream that inspires you about

1952.64 --> 1955.679
it

1953.279 --> 1955.679
you see

1956.48 --> 1963.2
and then a lot of people basically

1960.72 --> 1964.72
subconsciously choose not to learn the

1963.2 --> 1967.3600000000001
lesson

1964.72 --> 1969.3600000000001
because they want to keep dreaming and

1967.36 --> 1971.84
this is also the same mechanism that

1969.36 --> 1973.76
keeps people believing in the ball

1971.84 --> 1975.6
because it's full of that full of

1973.76 --> 1978.08
confrontations that

1975.6 --> 1980.7199999999998
make it impossible and they just don't

1978.08 --> 1983.76
want to learn the lessons

1980.72 --> 1983.76
it is basically the

1984.159 --> 1991.6000000000001
the the main source what

1987.44 --> 1995.039
what are you doing the main source of

1991.6 --> 1997.1999999999998
baller zealotry it's not the lie

1995.039 --> 1999.6
it's the unwillingness to learn the

1997.2 --> 1999.6000000000001
truth

2000.72 --> 2008.08
spam no it's not spam mark smiley

2005.919 --> 2010.0800000000002
oh okay yeah you didn't need to say that

2008.08 --> 2012.399
twice mark smiley

2010.08 --> 2013.12
and yeah you overdid the amount of

2012.399 --> 2015.9189999999999
comments

2013.12 --> 2017.5189999999998
a little a little but what am i saying a

2015.919 --> 2019.8400000000001
lot

2017.519 --> 2019.84
so

2021.519 --> 2025.279
i don't know man if you have so much to

2023.76 --> 2027.2
share and this is not

2025.279 --> 2028.559
this is not some kind of sarcastic joke

2027.2 --> 2030.96
or anything but

2028.559 --> 2033.44
if you have so much to share why don't

2030.96 --> 2036.08
you do your own show

2033.44 --> 2036.559
because mark smiler has a lot to say

2036.08 --> 2040.1589999999999
well

2036.559 --> 2040.1589999999999
why don't you just do it in a show

2040.96 --> 2047.279
get on camera and start talking

2045.039 --> 2048.96
it's much more appealing probably than a

2047.279 --> 2050.399
giant block of text in somebody's

2048.96 --> 2052.56
comment section

2050.399 --> 2053.7599999999998
and you'll find a much more personal

2052.56 --> 2057.2
cohesion

2053.76 --> 2057.2000000000003
when you do it so that's my

2058.839 --> 2061.839
recommendation

2071.04 --> 2077.44
that [ __ ] was all just had to let it go

2075.2 --> 2077.4399999999996
well

2085.599 --> 2093.119
it's just that when you really believe

2089.44 --> 2095.2000000000003
it's real the heliocentrism then

2093.119 --> 2097.359
you just because you really think it's

2095.2 --> 2099.7599999999998
real you start to draw certain

2097.359 --> 2101.359
logical consequences and then ponder on

2099.76 --> 2105.92
those

2101.359 --> 2107.359
right and those are a real waste of time

2105.92 --> 2109.839
because it's like oh i'm trying to

2107.359 --> 2112.7999999999997
figure it out something that's not real

2109.839 --> 2114.16
that's a waste of time but i still enjoy

2112.8 --> 2116.4
science fiction a lot

2114.16 --> 2117.359
look i'm watching babylon 5 and it's

2116.4 --> 2120.56
like oh some

2117.359 --> 2124.56
something just freaking blew up a planet

2120.56 --> 2127.7599999999998
and then i'm thinking again like oh huh

2124.56 --> 2131.2
what is that like what is that

2127.76 --> 2133.599
thing that idea like that's

2131.2 --> 2134.48
something specific like a concept that's

2133.599 --> 2136.56
specifically

2134.48 --> 2138.079
possible in heliocentrism like oh the

2136.56 --> 2142.16
destruction of a

2138.079 --> 2146.2400000000002
like blow up the realm or a realm

2142.16 --> 2146.24
it's weird and just thinking about it

2146.48 --> 2151.359
and then realizing like oh yeah if you

2148.64 --> 2153.2
think heliocentrism is real then that

2151.359 --> 2155.359
such seeing such a thing even in science

2153.2 --> 2156.72
fiction is terrifying because what if

2155.359 --> 2158.88
someday

2156.72 --> 2160.7999999999997
that might actually happen oh my god the

2158.88 --> 2162.2400000000002
aliens will come they might blow up our

2160.8 --> 2166.32
worlds or something

2162.24 --> 2168.56
right that's really unnerving

2166.32 --> 2170.2400000000002
if you think about that and there's yeah

2168.56 --> 2172.56
there's more things in babylon 5. if

2170.24 --> 2176.3999999999996
you're a space believer then babylon 5

2172.56 --> 2176.4
is pretty terrifying overall

2177.28 --> 2184.2400000000002
right it really is but if you just

2181.92 --> 2187.839
understand what is reality then it's

2184.24 --> 2187.839
just super interesting

2188.16 --> 2193.5989999999997
because it's very rich

2191.2 --> 2194.7999999999997
very widely researched culturally

2193.599 --> 2198.079
researched and

2194.8 --> 2202.0
figured out how to make

2198.079 --> 2205.28
everything how to make the cultures

2202.0 --> 2208.32
and yeah the story is just

2205.28 --> 2208.32
really big

2208.64 --> 2214.0
and cohesive anyway

2212.079 --> 2216.0
but yeah it's not as scary anymore

2214.0 --> 2217.76
because it's obvious like that can never

2216.0 --> 2221.28
happen blowing up a planet

2217.76 --> 2221.28
that's just illogical

2226.24 --> 2229.839
so yeah then it's not as scary

2238.8 --> 2241.8390000000004
so in a way to me it still exists it

2241.52 --> 2243.68
just

2241.839 --> 2244.88
exists in my fantasy and that is where

2243.68 --> 2247.9199999999996
it always existed

2244.88 --> 2250.0
i just was under the impression that

2247.92 --> 2252.0
that could be real that it was a fantasy

2250.0 --> 2254.4
that could be realized

2252.0 --> 2257.839
but it turns out it isn't that doesn't

2254.4 --> 2257.839
mean the end of it

2258.4 --> 2262.0
like think about it like this when

2260.96 --> 2265.44
you're playing

2262.0 --> 2267.76
with your legos as a very little kid

2265.44 --> 2269.599
you're definitely going to imagine like

2267.76 --> 2271.8390000000004
how it is actually real or a

2269.599 --> 2274.0
representation of physical reality

2271.839 --> 2274.96
in a small scale as you're playing with

2274.0 --> 2277.44
it

2274.96 --> 2278.48
right and you might have some really big

2277.44 --> 2280.96
fantasies

2278.48 --> 2281.76
build something fantastical or mystical

2280.96 --> 2284.16
or whatever

2281.76 --> 2286.079
space giant space they i did that space

2284.16 --> 2288.3199999999997
legos oh yeah

2286.079 --> 2291.04
and then still later have very fun

2288.32 --> 2291.04
memories of that

2292.24 --> 2297.52
and that just because what you were

2295.28 --> 2300.5600000000004
trying to imagine

2297.52 --> 2303.599
was not real doesn't mean that it wasn't

2300.56 --> 2303.599
a great experience

2307.599 --> 2316.0
you see so that is also

2311.52 --> 2316.24
my approach really to try to reconcile

2316.0 --> 2320.48
and

2316.24 --> 2322.16
solve the heliocentrism versus flatter

2320.48 --> 2327.839
situation

2322.16 --> 2327.839
to stop the to basically try to

2331.52 --> 2336.32
prevent the aggravation of the

2334.839 --> 2339.44
polarization

2336.32 --> 2341.839
which will lead to losing senses and

2339.44 --> 2343.68
conflict

2341.839 --> 2346.24
it's already proven that it does on the

2343.68 --> 2346.24
short term

2346.64 --> 2352.56
and what spurred forth my dual

2349.28 --> 2355.92
cosmogonical society as i called it

2352.56 --> 2355.92
even had hangouts about it

2366.56 --> 2370.7999999999997
and i just see it like this this very

2368.72 --> 2371.68
likely always going to be some people

2370.8 --> 2373.76
out there

2371.68 --> 2375.359
that are going to be very outspoken that

2373.76 --> 2377.6800000000003
will

2375.359 --> 2379.68
always try to make believe that outer

2377.68 --> 2381.52
space is real

2379.68 --> 2382.72
and that it's still all possible even

2381.52 --> 2384.4
though it's just

2382.72 --> 2386.48
kind of common knowledge that it's

2384.4 --> 2388.1600000000003
impossible and they will be there and

2386.48 --> 2391.2
they will stay there

2388.16 --> 2392.8799999999997
as that religion or as that type of

2391.2 --> 2395.68
religious cultist

2392.88 --> 2396.4
and it doesn't matter it's okay they

2395.68 --> 2399.1189999999997
should not be

2396.4 --> 2400.7200000000003
forced to wake up from it probably have

2399.119 --> 2411.839
a lot of personal struggle

2400.72 --> 2411.839
which keeps them in it

2413.68 --> 2419.1189999999997
all right i could never do what you guys

2418.24 --> 2421.7599999999998
do

2419.119 --> 2422.1600000000003
it's it make me yeah well what do you

2421.76 --> 2424.0
think

2422.16 --> 2425.359
do you think that i wasn't nervous at

2424.0 --> 2428.56
the beginnings actually

2425.359 --> 2431.359
dude i was super paranoid

2428.56 --> 2432.4
i was afraid like if i come on like

2431.359 --> 2434.88
somebody's

2432.4 --> 2436.839
like gonna take out a hit on me serious

2434.88 --> 2439.359
that's what i thought it was really

2436.839 --> 2443.44
terrifying

2439.359 --> 2446.4
so yeah it's scary

2443.44 --> 2446.88
but it gets better it gets a lot better

2446.4 --> 2448.48
it's just

2446.88 --> 2450.4
it takes a lot of practice and

2448.48 --> 2454.56
dedication

2450.4 --> 2456.88
and useful if you really start to try if

2454.56 --> 2459.68
you're going to engage and do that

2456.88 --> 2461.6800000000003
to kind of see it as a profession and to

2459.68 --> 2462.64
think into the future as to what are

2461.68 --> 2465.68
your skills where

2462.64 --> 2467.5989999999997
are you going at and figure out as

2465.68 --> 2468.96
you're doing it as you're trying things

2467.599 --> 2472.319
out like what

2468.96 --> 2475.839
fits me what am i good at what do i like

2472.319 --> 2478.0
doing what is appreciated from what i do

2475.839 --> 2481.2
what is not appreciated how do i work on

2478.0 --> 2482.56
that be a professional in your attitude

2481.2 --> 2484.8799999999997
and that doesn't mean that you have to

2482.56 --> 2487.119
be a cookie cutter and

2484.88 --> 2488.079
and like really contrived that you have

2487.119 --> 2490.1600000000003
to basically

2488.079 --> 2491.8390000000004
edit the way you are no you can choose

2490.16 --> 2493.92
whether you are just going to be very

2491.839 --> 2496.319
direct and spontaneous or whether you're

2493.92 --> 2498.319
going to be a typical

2496.319 --> 2501.119
more like a producer trying to put

2498.319 --> 2504.319
together really well edited videos

2501.119 --> 2505.92
you just have to figure it out

2504.319 --> 2508.48
and there's people that have been making

2505.92 --> 2511.52
video edit and re-pre-recorded videos

2508.48 --> 2511.52
for a long time

2511.599 --> 2514.96
that never really liked doing live

2514.56 --> 2516.72
things

2514.96 --> 2518.7200000000003
so they never really do it because it

2516.72 --> 2519.68
makes them nervous and they don't really

2518.72 --> 2522.16
want to

2519.68 --> 2524.0
do that they just want to do the editing

2522.16 --> 2526.72
right so it all depends i'm

2524.0 --> 2527.52
a guy that just never shuts the [ __ ] up

2526.72 --> 2529.839
right

2527.52 --> 2532.079
so doing a live show every day was my

2529.839 --> 2535.04
solution

2532.079 --> 2537.52
because i never shut the hell up that's

2535.04 --> 2540.4
really what makes that

2537.52 --> 2540.4
possible for me

2542.24 --> 2545.68
now aside of me never shutting the [ __ ]

2544.88 --> 2550.079
up

2545.68 --> 2553.2
i do have a lot of things to share

2550.079 --> 2554.079
i have a lot of inquiry i have higher

2553.2 --> 2558.48
thoughts

2554.079 --> 2563.04
relevant to things happening out there

2558.48 --> 2563.04
and ideas that i foresee will

2563.359 --> 2567.04
other people will also reach that level

2565.68 --> 2569.839
will eventually bring

2567.04 --> 2571.04
on those questions i've been doing that

2569.839 --> 2572.48
from the stars just

2571.04 --> 2574.48
always looking ahead it's like

2572.48 --> 2576.88
everybody's all there

2574.48 --> 2578.48
just in this region in this layer to

2576.88 --> 2580.319
just err

2578.48 --> 2582.96
and i'm like okay let's step away from

2580.319 --> 2587.2799999999997
that okay when this is solved

2582.96 --> 2587.28
that is where people will start to look

2587.839 --> 2591.599
so i'm going to now specialize in

2589.839 --> 2594.24
figuring this out so i can

2591.599 --> 2594.7200000000003
already build the road for when the rest

2594.24 --> 2598.3999999999996
will be

2594.72 --> 2600.319
ready to get there this is how i try to

2598.4 --> 2601.52
introduce the the holographic nature of

2600.319 --> 2605.7599999999998
the heavenly bodies

2601.52 --> 2610.16
this yeah the celestial demisphere

2605.76 --> 2612.48
and its non-physical elements

2610.16 --> 2614.3999999999996
because that was completely new in the

2612.48 --> 2615.28
beginning there's only very few hints

2614.4 --> 2617.52
about that

2615.28 --> 2619.52
that that that it was anything else than

2617.52 --> 2622.4
just a physical literal thing

2619.52 --> 2623.2
floating over a disk right that was the

2622.4 --> 2625.92
base idea

2623.2 --> 2629.04
nobody was bringing on that it might not

2625.92 --> 2629.04
actually be physical

2629.44 --> 2633.28
and light shining from a very specific

2631.92 --> 2636.4
object in a very

2633.28 --> 2638.6400000000003
specific euclidean location

2636.4 --> 2640.8
nobody knew about that i was putting

2638.64 --> 2643.68
that even in chats five years ago

2640.8 --> 2645.599
because i already thought of it

2643.68 --> 2648.0
and everybody was like what the hell is

2645.599 --> 2648.319
he blabbering about like holographic are

2648.0 --> 2650.16
you

2648.319 --> 2652.079
are you some kind of spin doctor trying

2650.16 --> 2656.0789999999997
to confuse us

2652.079 --> 2657.28
and now it's widely explored and

2656.079 --> 2659.28
understood

2657.28 --> 2661.28
because i was there waiting for

2659.28 --> 2664.48
everybody like are you getting this yet

2661.28 --> 2667.2000000000003
are you getting this yet and yeah

2664.48 --> 2669.44
a lot of people do not everybody and so

2667.2 --> 2671.2
a lot of people still stick to

2669.44 --> 2672.64
they've identified as a physicality

2671.2 --> 2674.8799999999997
assumption bias and just

2672.64 --> 2676.56
they have to see it as the earth has to

2674.88 --> 2679.1600000000003
be a disc because that's the only way

2676.56 --> 2682.0
the sun and the moon can be in specific

2679.16 --> 2684.8799999999997
triangulatable positions that we are

2682.0 --> 2687.119
going to assume they literally are there

2684.88 --> 2688.96
presupposing in the earth is orientated

2687.119 --> 2694.1600000000003
as a disk

2688.96 --> 2694.16
right so

2695.599 --> 2698.96
and what else yeah the looping nature

2698.16 --> 2702.0789999999997
yeah with the

2698.96 --> 2702.079
realization that

2703.44 --> 2708.4
the earth does not have to be a disc

2706.4 --> 2710.079
because the heavenly bodies do not have

2708.4 --> 2713.599
to have a euclidean

2710.079 --> 2715.52
location then suddenly

2713.599 --> 2716.88
the potential for another realm

2715.52 --> 2720.24
orientation

2716.88 --> 2724.1600000000003
and potential looping factor can be

2720.24 --> 2728.0
attained can be explored like is this

2724.16 --> 2729.359
possible not based on oh i can't imagine

2728.0 --> 2731.52
it i can't imagine oh

2729.359 --> 2734.319
how can that be supernatural it's all

2731.52 --> 2736.8
magical no no it's just like

2734.319 --> 2738.4
can we figure out whether there is a

2736.8 --> 2740.5600000000004
looping nature

2738.4 --> 2744.1600000000003
yes we can has to do with the

2740.56 --> 2744.16
orientation of the equator

2744.24 --> 2749.04
i've said this for many many times now

2746.72 --> 2751.2799999999997
over two years

2749.04 --> 2752.96
and i'm the only one saying it because

2751.28 --> 2755.52
everybody's still like

2752.96 --> 2756.56
we're too preoccupied with other things

2755.52 --> 2759.599
and gravity

2756.56 --> 2760.0
and that it doesn't exist and and we

2759.599 --> 2762.6400000000003
already

2760.0 --> 2764.72
need everything we need to know to

2762.64 --> 2766.56
dispel heliocentrism

2764.72 --> 2768.24
with the gas pressure without a

2766.56 --> 2771.44
container and all that

2768.24 --> 2774.319
right but

2771.44 --> 2775.04
the time hopefully at some point will

2774.319 --> 2777.7599999999998
arrive

2775.04 --> 2780.0
when people are actually ready to start

2777.76 --> 2781.76
figuring it out like what is the actual

2780.0 --> 2785.119
orientation of the land masses

2781.76 --> 2788.5600000000004
in a euclidean sense is it is the

2785.119 --> 2791.52
equator and a literal geometrical circle

2788.56 --> 2793.359
is it an arc or is it a straight line

2791.52 --> 2796.8
what is really going on

2793.359 --> 2799.52
and then yeah

2796.8 --> 2800.48
to just start realizing just because

2799.52 --> 2805.119
that

2800.48 --> 2806.96
disc map is very convenient

2805.119 --> 2809.2000000000003
for your imagination it doesn't make it

2806.96 --> 2810.7200000000003
too hard to try and imagine what the

2809.2 --> 2814.0
rail might be like does it mean that

2810.72 --> 2814.0
it's literally that

2814.4 --> 2817.839
it's still just a projection

2818.4 --> 2822.96
no i've never read seth's books i have

2820.96 --> 2825.44
no idea

2822.96 --> 2827.44
i i'm not much of a book reader seeking

2825.44 --> 2831.119
star order

2827.44 --> 2835.28
i barely read any books

2831.119 --> 2835.28
i've just listened to other people a lot

2839.04 --> 2845.839
written in the 60s before space travel

2841.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
hoax what

2849.839 --> 2856.0
right and besides i was kind of at a

2852.88 --> 2859.6800000000003
certain point i was kind of made to fear

2856.0 --> 2861.599
figuring out these things i was really

2859.68 --> 2864.72
afraid

2861.599 --> 2867.28
that people would haunt me if i figured

2864.72 --> 2868.64
i kind of i knew there was forbidden

2867.28 --> 2870.8390000000004
information

2868.64 --> 2872.48
and i think flat earth was a big part of

2870.839 --> 2874.88
that

2872.48 --> 2875.599
every time anything related to that came

2874.88 --> 2878.4
up

2875.599 --> 2880.6400000000003
with certain people they would get they

2878.4 --> 2882.96
would literally start to threaten me

2880.64 --> 2884.839
and not just from a subconscious

2882.96 --> 2888.96
condition

2884.839 --> 2892.72
angle that happened to me many times

2888.96 --> 2896.0
so i was even afraid

2892.72 --> 2897.2
to seek out like these unique books and

2896.0 --> 2901.839
all that although i knew

2897.2 --> 2901.839
there they were out there

2913.68 --> 2919.04
anyway that but that happened all a long

2916.079 --> 2919.04
time ago so

2927.599 --> 2931.04
but yeah can you hint at as to what it's

2930.16 --> 2934.48
about

2931.04 --> 2936.64
since the stars we see have moved on to

2934.48 --> 2941.52
create other realms

2936.64 --> 2944.96
okay that's

2941.52 --> 2949.28
to me that is kind of yeah

2944.96 --> 2949.68
nonsense it or it is esoteric and then

2949.28 --> 2952.4
it

2949.68 --> 2954.839
it's just a reification of esoteric

2952.4 --> 2957.839
concepts into these

2954.839 --> 2957.839
lights

2959.839 --> 2963.2799999999997
into the celestial lights

2966.4 --> 2984.88
no one would ever land on the moon cool

2968.96 --> 2987.52
i didn't know that that's hilarious

2984.88 --> 2990.2400000000002
how can the luminaries be physical

2987.52 --> 2992.24
that's a really weird question

2990.24 --> 2994.3999999999996
i don't think that they are i think they

2992.24 --> 2997.7599999999998
are

2994.4 --> 2999.92
basically side effects of light manifest

2997.76 --> 3002.079
non-localized light manifest that

2999.92 --> 3003.52
basically light that only arrives it

3002.079 --> 3005.44
doesn't actually

3003.52 --> 3007.119
actually come from a specific light

3005.44 --> 3010.839
source

3007.119 --> 3013.359
that's already kind of surreal and well

3010.839 --> 3016.96
unprovable

3013.359 --> 3016.96
but that's what i think it is

3018.88 --> 3024.319
but if

3022.16 --> 3026.3999999999996
they were let's presuppose that they are

3024.319 --> 3027.2799999999997
actually lights coming from specific

3026.4 --> 3030.319
points well

3027.28 --> 3030.8
how could that be well if there was just

3030.319 --> 3033.839
some

3030.8 --> 3035.2000000000003
yeah there's energy in the air and the

3033.839 --> 3039.2
energy

3035.2 --> 3042.5589999999997
logically would have to feed into

3039.2 --> 3045.839
yeah the light because the energy of

3042.559 --> 3046.7200000000003
the light has to be subtracted from

3045.839 --> 3048.319
somewhere

3046.72 --> 3049.7599999999998
where's all this energy from the sun

3048.319 --> 3051.92
coming from otherwise

3049.76 --> 3054.3190000000004
it has to come from somewhere and

3051.92 --> 3056.4
there's energy in the air so maybe

3054.319 --> 3059.04
that's the source for it for how it

3056.4 --> 3059.04
manifests

3063.76 --> 3067.0400000000004
or yeah one could say oh it's coming

3066.24 --> 3069.68
from the other

3067.04 --> 3072.72
dimension or from god which hey the

3069.68 --> 3072.72
bible kind of does

3073.599 --> 3077.839
does explain that in its own way

3078.4 --> 3084.64
but yeah i'm trying to stay

3081.68 --> 3085.2799999999997
physical and i'm i'm trying to approach

3084.64 --> 3087.92
the realm

3085.28 --> 3088.8
more as a designer as a self-contained

3087.92 --> 3092.48
system

3088.8 --> 3095.3590000000004
or everything that is present is

3092.48 --> 3097.92
within the system that's how i try to

3095.359 --> 3097.92
size it up

3098.64 --> 3103.52
or how i'm trying to figure it out and

3101.52 --> 3105.28
hey it might be wrong but at least that

3103.52 --> 3107.04
is the more sensible way for me to

3105.28 --> 3111.8390000000004
approach it

3107.04 --> 3111.839
to even try to figure it out

3117.2 --> 3125.839
there cannot be a rock floating in here

3132.319 --> 3136.0
i don't know if there cannot be a rock

3134.319 --> 3139.119
floating air

3136.0 --> 3142.079
maybe it can at some point

3139.119 --> 3142.6400000000003
but does that mean that that the moon is

3142.079 --> 3145.6800000000003
a rock

3142.64 --> 3147.5989999999997
floating in the air no it doesn't like

3145.68 --> 3149.359
even if we could make a rock float

3147.599 --> 3151.2000000000003
somehow

3149.359 --> 3152.88
through i don't know electrostatics or

3151.2 --> 3155.04
something

3152.88 --> 3156.88
that would popularly be called

3155.04 --> 3159.2
anti-gravity of course

3156.88 --> 3160.2400000000002
right that doesn't automatically then

3159.2 --> 3163.04
imply that

3160.24 --> 3164.3999999999996
of course the moon is a rock right that

3163.04 --> 3168.16
would be

3164.4 --> 3168.8
delusional to assume so i wouldn't just

3168.16 --> 3170.5589999999997
say

3168.8 --> 3172.319
a rock cannot be floating in air because

3170.559 --> 3174.079
one day maybe a rock can't float in

3172.319 --> 3177.68
there that doesn't mean that the moon is

3174.079 --> 3177.6800000000003
a floating rock in the air though

3178.839 --> 3181.839
see

3188.8 --> 3195.8390000000004
light is intelligence the word was god

3192.839 --> 3197.359
uh

3195.839 --> 3199.68
i think that's another type of light

3197.359 --> 3202.5589999999997
that's illumination or

3199.68 --> 3202.5589999999997
enlightenment

3205.119 --> 3208.2400000000002
because light is light and intelligence

3207.839 --> 3211.119
is

3208.24 --> 3211.1189999999997
supernatural

3214.88 --> 3223.839
it's information based

3229.92 --> 3235.119
quantum levitation what is quantum

3233.119 --> 3238.4
levitation

3235.119 --> 3238.4
that that sounds

3239.76 --> 3242.4
ridiculous

3244.319 --> 3253.92
needs a track

3251.68 --> 3257.04
same thing no it's not the same that's

3253.92 --> 3257.04
called a reification

3259.44 --> 3265.52
if you're just gonna say oh look

3263.2 --> 3267.2799999999997
it's the patterns are similar that means

3265.52 --> 3269.839
it's the same yeah you know what

3267.28 --> 3271.52
that that's been done like even in

3269.839 --> 3274.0789999999997
physics

3271.52 --> 3275.68
try to suggest like oh look everything

3274.079 --> 3279.04
has a frequency and an

3275.68 --> 3279.52
energy that means it is all the same

3279.04 --> 3282.4
thing

3279.52 --> 3283.92
like light is material too that's that's

3282.4 --> 3287.04
how they

3283.92 --> 3289.04
let that roll so i wouldn't just

3287.04 --> 3291.839
reify something say oh it's the same

3289.04 --> 3294.48
thing light and intelligence no it's not

3291.839 --> 3296.5589999999997
in a from a physics

3294.48 --> 3299.52
sense it is definitely not the same

3296.559 --> 3303.119
thing one is supernatural the other is

3299.52 --> 3304.24
natural it's just not fully understood

3303.119 --> 3306.88
but it's provably

3304.24 --> 3309.5989999999997
natural in that from the natural

3306.88 --> 3309.599
physical world

3310.799 --> 3316.319
frozen magnet thingy okay

3314.88 --> 3318.839
i don't know what that would have to do

3316.319 --> 3321.68
with quantum

3318.839 --> 3325.52
locked

3321.68 --> 3325.52
so it's just magnetic levitation

3332.559 --> 3335.8390000000004
light is different on it well it is of

3335.119 --> 3337.6800000000003
course it's

3335.839 --> 3339.7599999999998
it's very different it's very weird and

3337.68 --> 3344.0789999999997
mysterious

3339.76 --> 3344.079
it's just not it's not matter

3344.799 --> 3349.2
it's not supernatural either it's there

3347.599 --> 3351.3590000000004
it's just something else

3349.2 --> 3352.64
light is its own category i'd like to

3351.359 --> 3355.92
think at this point

3352.64 --> 3359.2799999999997
it really is has unique properties that

3355.92 --> 3363.839
does not abide to the supernatural or

3359.28 --> 3363.8390000000004
the physical like matter

3368.64 --> 3377.839
in a physics sense that is

3381.04 --> 3391.2
all right quantum locked

3384.64 --> 3394.5589999999997
magnetic levitation right

3391.2 --> 3397.2
well you can't quantum levitate

3394.559 --> 3398.48
a rock you have to actually have

3397.2 --> 3401.68
magnetic

3398.48 --> 3405.839
like magnetic viable components for that

3401.68 --> 3405.839
i think

3409.119 --> 3419.839
that's cute

3426.4 --> 3430.799
i don't really see how it's quantum

3428.559 --> 3430.799
though

3431.68 --> 3436.319
it's just magnetic it's like see it's

3434.079 --> 3436.319
just

3443.62 --> 3446.799
[Music]

3444.839 --> 3450.799
magnetic

3446.799 --> 3453.28
should i get a nickname uh if you like

3450.799 --> 3456.079
you don't have to if look i think zack

3453.28 --> 3459.2000000000003
sterling is a pretty cool name i think

3456.079 --> 3460.799
it depends on what you want to do

3459.2 --> 3462.5589999999997
you kind of already put your name out

3460.799 --> 3467.04
there now if you want to

3462.559 --> 3467.0400000000004
get some internet name you could

3468.0 --> 3475.839
but yeah depends on what you want to do

3477.44 --> 3489.28
a perturbed city caused by the what

3482.72 --> 3492.3999999999996
oh god

3489.28 --> 3495.8390000000004
what seeking star water

3492.4 --> 3497.599
ah you're losing me just see a lot of

3495.839 --> 3503.68
nicknames

3497.599 --> 3506.799
yeah well that's everybody's choice

3503.68 --> 3506.799
look you don't have to

3507.52 --> 3511.52
become like us you know you might not

3510.319 --> 3516.319
feel like okay

3511.52 --> 3519.44
i want to be part of this

3516.319 --> 3521.92
they take it as far as you like it's

3519.44 --> 3521.92
just that

3528.079 --> 3532.7200000000003
it depends on you are you comfortable

3530.079 --> 3535.04
just using your own name

3532.72 --> 3537.9199999999996
you want to have it more as like a a

3535.04 --> 3540.4
public internet brand

3537.92 --> 3542.7200000000003
or do you want to be known as something

3540.4 --> 3542.7200000000003
else

3542.799 --> 3546.64
doing this you know it's up to you

3551.68 --> 3559.839
you don't read so what

3563.52 --> 3573.839
what is that supposed to mean

3583.839 --> 3587.7599999999998
no i think light is light i don't think

3586.24 --> 3591.9199999999996
our will

3587.76 --> 3591.92
has anything to do with it necessarily

3593.68 --> 3599.5989999999997
and i'm talking about perceivable light

3597.2 --> 3600.96
and yeah look even when it comes to like

3599.599 --> 3605.44
i'm not going to adapt

3600.96 --> 3608.0
everything i know or even wonder upon it

3605.44 --> 3608.799
when i don't know if the knowing which

3608.0 --> 3612.72
path

3608.799 --> 3615.119
experiment is actually real right oh

3612.72 --> 3616.799
the controversy right yeah i know

3615.119 --> 3619.6800000000003
exactly how it's supposed to work

3616.799 --> 3620.16
i get it i totally get it i've just not

3619.68 --> 3623.2
had

3620.16 --> 3626.24
a personal demonstration

3623.2 --> 3627.52
i've not been able to personally figure

3626.24 --> 3631.839
it out like

3627.52 --> 3635.28
whether it is all real and i have my own

3631.839 --> 3637.2799999999997
testing ideas about it even like how to

3635.28 --> 3639.2000000000003
confirm it because i'm very

3637.28 --> 3641.28
detailed about those types of things i

3639.2 --> 3646.5589999999997
don't want to take things for granted

3641.28 --> 3648.7200000000003
ever unless i have legitimate reason to

3646.559 --> 3651.76
and for that i need to physically test

3648.72 --> 3651.7599999999998
it in person

3654.079 --> 3661.92
so i don't know if the supernatural can

3658.4 --> 3661.92
actually influence light

3668.559 --> 3671.599
and even it has to do with more with

3670.88 --> 3675.2000000000003
conscious

3671.599 --> 3679.92
knowledge of rather than

3675.2 --> 3679.9199999999996
the will which is another element

3682.079 --> 3685.8390000000004
i can't discuss what i haven't read

3686.799 --> 3694.319
what do you mean are you saying that

3689.839 --> 3694.319
this guy said that from the book

3694.48 --> 3699.839
what's his name again

3706.88 --> 3710.6400000000003
that yeah the seth books is he talking

3709.2 --> 3713.839
about perturbation of

3710.64 --> 3713.839
ether and all that

3715.039 --> 3718.559
concepts i use from tar tarot book oh

3717.52 --> 3722.559
okay

3718.559 --> 3724.7200000000003
deep and white no it's just not

3722.559 --> 3726.88
physics seeking star wars that's the

3724.72 --> 3727.9199999999996
difference you're getting this from a

3726.88 --> 3730.559
tarot book

3727.92 --> 3732.4
it's obviously not physics it's

3730.559 --> 3736.2400000000002
esoterics it's different

3732.4 --> 3736.2400000000002
it's a totally different language

3736.48 --> 3744.319
it's not wise to equivocate

3739.64 --> 3744.319
esoterics with physics

3748.24 --> 3755.839
so yeah that explains why we're like

3750.24 --> 3755.839
talking past one another

3761.039 --> 3764.1600000000003
jane roberts okay

3766.839 --> 3769.839
right

3774.079 --> 3778.7200000000003
like i don't mind talking about

3775.599 --> 3782.079
esoterics but it's very different

3778.72 --> 3782.8799999999997
from physics so like in esoterics when

3782.079 --> 3786.4
somebody says

3782.88 --> 3789.599
light it obviously does not mean

3786.4 --> 3789.599
physics light

3790.4 --> 3793.599
i am writing it through okay this is

3791.839 --> 3797.839
getting really confusing now seeking

3793.599 --> 3797.839
star wars

3813.28 --> 3817.52
rice experiment what

3819.76 --> 3825.599
i i don't know about that but i already

3823.68 --> 3828.96
feel like that's probably not a

3825.599 --> 3828.96
scientific experiment

3829.039 --> 3833.599
but maybe it is i don't know i've never

3831.2 --> 3836.8799999999997
heard of that george sanford

3833.599 --> 3840.96
but yeah of course intention look i know

3836.88 --> 3845.52
from practical experience that attention

3840.96 --> 3848.96
literally influences things it's like

3845.52 --> 3853.599
my intention can keep a plant

3848.96 --> 3855.68
and you alive for an unusually long time

3853.599 --> 3857.2000000000003
and then when i don't it never lives

3855.68 --> 3859.44
that long so yeah

3857.2 --> 3861.1189999999997
i know doesn't mean it's scientific

3859.44 --> 3866.0
though it doesn't mean it directly falls

3861.119 --> 3868.079
under physics

3866.0 --> 3869.039
now you don't have to shut up seeking

3868.079 --> 3871.039
star wars it's

3869.039 --> 3873.28
just that i'm getting a little confused

3871.039 --> 3873.28
now

3876.88 --> 3882.799
dr emoto i presume yeah a problem with

3879.839 --> 3882.799
dr emoto is

3883.039 --> 3887.44
it's i i don't yeah he was considered

3886.0 --> 3889.92
pseudoscience

3887.44 --> 3895.839
because he basically does not really

3889.92 --> 3895.839
abide by the scientific method

3896.96 --> 3900.96
doesn't mean that it's not very very

3899.44 --> 3904.079
interesting

3900.96 --> 3909.839
and important to know about it it just

3904.079 --> 3909.8390000000004
doesn't really fall under normal physics

3913.68 --> 3923.839
the basics of physics are all no

3916.799 --> 3923.839
no nope

3924.4 --> 3928.0
i know water has memory

3929.52 --> 3933.839
the physics does not disprove that

3935.039 --> 3941.76
come on talking about physics

3938.72 --> 3941.7599999999998
scientific method

3944.64 --> 3948.64
but if you're like

3948.799 --> 3954.88
if something out there doesn't work

3952.48 --> 3958.0
together

3954.88 --> 3960.0
or it like seems to oppose information

3958.0 --> 3962.4
out there that you've learned and

3960.0 --> 3963.839
basically figured out to be true

3962.4 --> 3967.039
doesn't mean that you should just

3963.839 --> 3979.839
discard it because it does not allow it

3967.039 --> 3979.8390000000004
what you like that's extremely foolish

3982.96 --> 3987.52
water is not understood nor light or the

3984.96 --> 3990.799
atom uh

3987.52 --> 3991.119
that's a really vague statement i think

3990.799 --> 3992.96
that

3991.119 --> 4007.039
to some degree they are understood that

3992.96 --> 4010.88
doesn't mean that that is all of it

4007.039 --> 4021.8390000000004
rip cuff table of elements what

4010.88 --> 4021.839
never heard of that

4023.28 --> 4028.0
all right yeah but saying things like

4025.599 --> 4032.079
the basics of physics are all wrong that

4028.0 --> 4036.319
that's not good not good

4032.079 --> 4049.8390000000004
not good at all if you say that then you

4036.319 --> 4049.839
you don't really understand

4092.48 --> 4096.64
all right dutch sailor by the way see

4094.48 --> 4098.64
you there talking about the law of

4096.64 --> 4100.96
attraction

4098.64 --> 4100.96
right

4101.759 --> 4106.96
i'll i'll definitely go with that but

4104.96 --> 4108.799
that is super esoteric though

4106.96 --> 4110.319
it's purely about consciousness and

4108.799 --> 4119.839
spirit

4110.319 --> 4119.839000000001
has nothing to do with physics

4130.839 --> 4133.839
okay

4140.719 --> 4148.719
hello love ya

4144.4 --> 4148.719
do you do streams patricia.cree on d

4158.839 --> 4161.839
live

4171.759 --> 4179.44
huh i see a luna love loves ya

4176.159 --> 4182.159
with zero followers is that you

4179.44 --> 4185.04
or are you with the two a's with one

4182.159 --> 4185.04
follower i don't know

4187.6 --> 4190.799
i just listening okay

4199.76 --> 4204.400000000001
and the consciousness is the base of

4202.0 --> 4217.84
physics it does relate

4204.4 --> 4217.839999999999
yeah that's cute it isn't though

4222.64 --> 4231.84
ah one follower that's you okay well

4224.56 --> 4231.84
let's make that two

4242.84 --> 4248.299
hmm

4245.18 --> 4248.299
[Music]

4251.33 --> 4254.92
[Music]

4272.0 --> 4276.0
right so i don't know i'm not trying to

4276.4 --> 4279.44
be a stick in the mud here it's just

4278.32 --> 4282.88
that

4279.44 --> 4287.28
i keep my esoterics and my exit yeah

4282.88 --> 4291.76
exoteric my esoterics versus exoterics

4287.28 --> 4294.8
and the physics department separated

4291.76 --> 4296.4800000000005
because they deal with things on

4294.8 --> 4298.96
the total counter opposite of the

4296.48 --> 4298.959999999999
spectrum

4299.84 --> 4306.2390000000005
it's never fully going to match

4302.96 --> 4309.52
i think but it could

4306.239 --> 4312.639999999999
synchronize that's what i think

4309.52 --> 4315.52
i think that if like at first it's like

4312.64 --> 4317.4400000000005
physics foundation esoteric personal

4315.52 --> 4319.120000000001
experience foundation

4317.44 --> 4321.678999999999
and i think that they can eventually

4319.12 --> 4324.0
grow grow and then instead of like oh

4321.679 --> 4324.96
one has to be chosen over the other it

4324.0 --> 4327.679
just becomes

4324.96 --> 4328.0
parallel and then it fills each other in

4327.679 --> 4331.76
almost

4328.0 --> 4334.48
like a like puzzle pieces

4331.76 --> 4334.4800000000005
conjoined

4341.44 --> 4348.08
but yeah it should not bridge because

4345.199 --> 4351.28
they aren't the same they don't deal

4348.08 --> 4351.28
with the same levels

4351.84 --> 4357.84
they have different foundations

4364.08 --> 4371.84
we humans are that rich that's esoteric

4379.44 --> 4385.839999999999
you can find one through the other

4388.08 --> 4391.199
i don't see how

4397.28 --> 4403.759999999999
of course patricia dockery but my

4400.56 --> 4405.84
point is is that you shouldn't

4403.76 --> 4407.84
reify one into the other you shouldn't

4405.84 --> 4412.0
just say oh i got so much

4407.84 --> 4416.0
it has to be one just surgically

4412.0 --> 4419.28
tied in no no

4416.0 --> 4423.44
no that doesn't work trust me

4419.28 --> 4426.639999999999
i've tried it's

4423.44 --> 4429.04
it just breaks the integrity of both

4426.64 --> 4429.04
things

4433.44 --> 4440.0
they are not separable that's ridiculous

4436.64 --> 4442.64
they are not fusible they are

4440.0 --> 4442.64
separated

4445.52 --> 4452.159000000001
physics and esoterics are separated

4449.28 --> 4454.159
per definition they're not of the same

4452.159 --> 4456.879999999999
approach not of the same

4454.159 --> 4456.879999999999
frequency

4464.159 --> 4483.839999999999
surgery no this is sorry but this is

4468.239 --> 4483.839999999999
getting um

4484.96 --> 4489.92
if you if you try to consciously analyze

4488.0 --> 4492.719
things

4489.92 --> 4494.64
then it doesn't tie together now if you

4492.719 --> 4496.88
don't consciously analyze things you

4494.64 --> 4499.92
just do everything through intuition

4496.88 --> 4505.04
you'll deal with both fields

4499.92 --> 4511.84
surely that does not make them one thing

4505.04 --> 4511.84
it doesn't

4521.6 --> 4526.96
it's just this unification of all things

4524.56 --> 4530.88
it needs to stop

4526.96 --> 4530.88
things are not all unified

4534.48 --> 4539.839999999999
not here anyway

4544.08 --> 4547.679
or maybe it could make an extremely

4546.0 --> 4549.28
esoteric statement

4547.679 --> 4551.52
without separation there is no

4549.28 --> 4553.759999999999
experience

4551.52 --> 4553.76
hmm

4561.6 --> 4566.0
no that's a self-contradictory statement

4564.48 --> 4569.36
they are separate but one

4566.0 --> 4571.76
no they are separate they are not one

4569.36 --> 4573.839999999999
just because they are parallel to one

4571.76 --> 4581.280000000001
another overlay yeah they work together

4573.84 --> 4582.88
that doesn't mean they are one

4581.28 --> 4584.5599999999995
there's different foundations there are

4582.88 --> 4587.1990000000005
different approaches

4584.56 --> 4587.84
one cannot be made to integrate with the

4587.199 --> 4591.12
other

4587.84 --> 4594.88
but they can work parallel

4591.12 --> 4595.599999999999
does not make them one stop reifying

4594.88 --> 4609.84
it's i'm

4595.6 --> 4609.84
starting to get on my nerves here

4613.71 --> 4616.819
[Music]

4618.8 --> 4622.64
right well that that's a great

4620.719 --> 4624.0
comparison toward wazzle thank you for

4622.64 --> 4626.64
that

4624.0 --> 4628.159
yeah she swore in one hand shield in the

4626.64 --> 4637.84
other

4628.159 --> 4637.839999999999
it's a great metaphor

4638.48 --> 4642.959999999999
intuition by its nature is supernatural

4640.719 --> 4644.64
yes so it's the consciousness and so is

4642.96 --> 4646.8
information there's a lot of things

4644.64 --> 4649.84
supernatural

4646.8 --> 4650.96
in physics specifically right because

4649.84 --> 4654.08
supernatural

4650.96 --> 4656.08
is not just a religious statement it's

4654.08 --> 4659.199
not just a religious lingo

4656.08 --> 4661.76
it is also physics lingo and it is

4659.199 --> 4662.799999999999
slightly different it's not literally

4661.76 --> 4667.04
the same right

4662.8 --> 4670.159000000001
one world in word in one field

4667.04 --> 4673.36
is different from the use of the word

4670.159 --> 4678.799999999999
in the other field it all

4673.36 --> 4681.12
it does relate it's not the same though

4678.8 --> 4682.8
it's very important to keep it separate

4681.12 --> 4686.0
and it is confusing

4682.8 --> 4686.719
that's a problem like even a language

4686.0 --> 4690.239
like

4686.719 --> 4693.12
english eventually things

4690.239 --> 4693.599999999999
will bump into each other because of the

4693.12 --> 4695.44
sheer

4693.6 --> 4707.84
preponderance of what is done with the

4695.44 --> 4707.839999999999
language and how it is used

4721.36 --> 4724.88
i heard you say the opinion there's no

4722.88 --> 4728.400000000001
such thing as supernatural

4724.88 --> 4732.08
well that was not a physics statement

4728.4 --> 4734.799999999999
tintin when and hey maybe

4732.08 --> 4736.0
you like when did i say that because you

4734.8 --> 4738.400000000001
have to realize that

4736.0 --> 4739.84
my understanding of things and physics

4738.4 --> 4743.92
has been developing

4739.84 --> 4747.4400000000005
in the last few years four years ago

4743.92 --> 4749.84
i was not as well studied in this i did

4747.44 --> 4749.839999999999
not

4750.08 --> 4756.96
have all the understanding yet

4754.48 --> 4758.0
i'd forgotten a lot and had not learned

4756.96 --> 4760.56
everything yet

4758.0 --> 4762.64
i've learned a lot of physics in the

4760.56 --> 4777.84
last few years a lot of it

4762.64 --> 4777.84
more than i learned in school

4786.719 --> 4791.12
right but when is probably tin tine ben

4789.36 --> 4792.88
what you caught of me saying there's no

4791.12 --> 4794.64
such thing as supernatural what that

4792.88 --> 4797.76
implies

4794.64 --> 4800.0
is not a physics statement it's just

4797.76 --> 4804.56
that i don't think that

4800.0 --> 4808.0
things can happen that would not be

4804.56 --> 4809.679
naturally possible like i don't think

4808.0 --> 4813.679
there is a way to

4809.679 --> 4815.76
counteract natural law

4813.679 --> 4817.52
like nothing can reverse entropy for

4815.76 --> 4820.0
example but

4817.52 --> 4820.96
that doesn't mean that incredible things

4820.0 --> 4822.719
are not possible

4820.96 --> 4824.32
it's just that when somebody said it's

4822.719 --> 4828.56
supernatural this happened this

4824.32 --> 4832.0
miracle whatever and just like no

4828.56 --> 4833.6
you just don't understand how to do it

4832.0 --> 4835.52
and that was probably what that

4833.6 --> 4837.1990000000005
statement implied i don't believe in the

4835.52 --> 4838.320000000001
supernatural it's just you don't

4837.199 --> 4840.638999999999
understand

4838.32 --> 4841.92
er if it if it's happening then it must

4840.639 --> 4847.84
be possible

4841.92 --> 4847.84
you just don't know how

4852.8 --> 4857.76
humans can reduce entropy no no they

4858.84 --> 4864.639
can't

4861.44 --> 4867.28
entropy will still keep going

4864.639 --> 4869.4400000000005
you could say they could slow it down

4867.28 --> 4871.5199999999995
perhaps

4869.44 --> 4873.839999999999
but the entropy is not something you can

4871.52 --> 4874.320000000001
slow down or speed up actually it's more

4873.84 --> 4878.719
just

4874.32 --> 4881.84
you'll have less impact

4878.719 --> 4881.84
you can make yourself

4882.08 --> 4887.44
in such a way or compose yourself that

4885.28 --> 4889.04
eventually entropy will have less

4887.44 --> 4891.44
influence on you but you

4889.04 --> 4892.48
technically don't slow down or reduce

4891.44 --> 4896.159
entropy entropy

4892.48 --> 4899.919999999999
is an ever-present effect

4896.159 --> 4899.92
that cannot be changed

4901.12 --> 4904.08
it's natural law

4909.6 --> 4917.84
children are not clones what

4930.239 --> 4933.199
yeah it's wrong

4937.04 --> 4940.8
children are not clones they're not

4942.84 --> 4946.56
copies

4944.639 --> 4948.400000000001
that might have similar traits but

4946.56 --> 4951.360000000001
they're never exactly the same

4948.4 --> 4953.5199999999995
there's a big spectrum of personalities

4951.36 --> 4953.5199999999995
that

4953.92 --> 4957.52
come from a single individual

4956.32 --> 4959.759999999999
potentially

4957.52 --> 4961.280000000001
it's like every person stores a whole

4959.76 --> 4965.92
lot of characters

4961.28 --> 4965.92
within their genetic pool

4966.56 --> 4974.0
now it is it happens more

4969.6 --> 4977.120000000001
often that for example your grandchild

4974.0 --> 4978.08
will be extremely similar to you that is

4977.12 --> 4981.12
something that is

4978.08 --> 4984.719
happens an unusual amount that is like a

4981.12 --> 4987.12
generational echo two generations

4984.719 --> 4988.53
and they keep repeating off this often

4987.12 --> 4990.8
happens

4988.53 --> 4994.0
[Music]

4990.8 --> 4996.08
that character types the type of of

4994.0 --> 4998.159
how a person unfolds becomes very

4996.08 --> 5002.96
similar to their grandparents

4998.159 --> 5005.839999999999
even if they never knew them really

5002.96 --> 5006.639
but it's not a copy it's just what type

5005.84 --> 5011.679
of spirit

5006.639 --> 5011.679
from the pool will manifest naturally

5012.639 --> 5015.84
that's how i see it

5038.239 --> 5042.239
stop semantics but semantics are

5040.84 --> 5044.08
important

5042.239 --> 5045.839999999999
if you if you want to make a profound

5044.08 --> 5057.84
statement you better damn well make sure

5045.84 --> 5057.84
you say it right

5063.02 --> 5066.079000000001
[Music]

5069.84 --> 5076.639
it woke you up what are you saying dutch

5074.159 --> 5076.638999999999
say there

5079.84 --> 5082.88
oh there was no one in the room but

5081.52 --> 5087.280000000001
myself it

5082.88 --> 5087.28
also woke me up what what is it

5091.679 --> 5094.96
oh wait i see the comment right before

5093.76 --> 5098.320000000001
that

5094.96 --> 5101.28
sorry i had my myself had experienced

5098.32 --> 5103.679
the glass bell jar with a candle in the

5101.28 --> 5107.04
middle of the night

5103.679 --> 5113.84
fell from a sound speaker

5107.04 --> 5113.84
what that's bizarre

5119.52 --> 5124.400000000001
yeah from a esoteric

5122.8 --> 5126.639
perspective i'd say that would be

5124.4 --> 5129.839999999999
supernatural probably

5126.639 --> 5129.84
spirit activity

5130.159 --> 5136.5599999999995
through you or remote from the

5133.199 --> 5138.839999999999
from the dying person who knows

5136.56 --> 5141.84
it yeah those are like the mysterious

5138.84 --> 5141.84
things

5154.96 --> 5158.639
right okay so if you meant the same

5156.96 --> 5161.679
thing

5158.639 --> 5161.679
then what's the problem

5164.32 --> 5167.5199999999995
it's just that you use the word clone

5166.56 --> 5171.04
and that seemed

5167.52 --> 5171.040000000001
very out of place

5172.159 --> 5175.28
the thing about a clone is is that they

5174.08 --> 5177.6
are

5175.28 --> 5179.44
literally a copy that's what makes it a

5177.6 --> 5182.320000000001
clone

5179.44 --> 5183.12
and regular procreation is nothing like

5182.32 --> 5186.159
cloning

5183.12 --> 5186.159
nothing even close

5190.96 --> 5194.96
so i don't think it's just semantics i i

5194.08 --> 5198.719
just call it a

5194.96 --> 5202.32
poor choice of words but at least

5198.719 --> 5202.32
i understand what you were trying to

5208.84 --> 5211.84
convey

5215.12 --> 5221.76
beyond weird yeah i get it if i i've had

5218.08 --> 5221.76
some of those experiences myself

5222.08 --> 5228.8
like i had a really heavy supernatural

5225.679 --> 5231.92
experience when my mother died

5228.8 --> 5235.04
like literally in the night

5231.92 --> 5235.04
it was very dark

5235.679 --> 5239.76
like her ghosts just came to me like

5239.04 --> 5242.639
literally

5239.76 --> 5242.639
a white veil

5242.96 --> 5246.0
like suddenly just moved out of out of

5245.44 --> 5247.678999999999
the house

5246.0 --> 5249.44
into the garden approached me where i

5247.679 --> 5252.719
was in the night

5249.44 --> 5255.12
and then had like literally yeah

5252.719 --> 5257.04
like a psionic interface with me and i

5255.12 --> 5258.719
saw her face like in a vision in front

5257.04 --> 5262.08
of me as if she was really young

5258.719 --> 5264.159
she could not audibly speak but she was

5262.08 --> 5267.5199999999995
conveying feelings

5264.159 --> 5269.36
and did pick that up and then yeah

5267.52 --> 5271.1990000000005
was like really overwhelmed by the

5269.36 --> 5272.96
experience like whoa what just happened

5271.199 --> 5274.4
and then my brother

5272.96 --> 5276.32
approached me and said he just had a

5274.4 --> 5278.4
call that she had died

5276.32 --> 5280.08
that happened so yeah supernatural oh

5278.4 --> 5283.36
yeah supernatural experience

5280.08 --> 5286.8
i had my share that's just one and that

5283.36 --> 5289.44
one also did definitely give me

5286.8 --> 5291.12
i guess i guess you could say hope or an

5289.44 --> 5294.159
indication that

5291.12 --> 5295.84
there is more after death like there has

5294.159 --> 5297.679
to be

5295.84 --> 5299.1990000000005
with such an experience now what would

5297.679 --> 5303.12
that be

5299.199 --> 5306.4
yeah i don't know exactly

5303.12 --> 5310.719
but there is something after it

5306.4 --> 5310.719
and that experience was vivid proof of

5320.84 --> 5323.84
it

5345.76 --> 5348.159000000001
what

5354.0 --> 5358.4
yeah i know you meant parents but still

5356.48 --> 5359.759999999999
that sentence doesn't make a whole lot

5358.4 --> 5362.799999999999
of sense

5359.76 --> 5364.719
i already addressed it like in one

5362.8 --> 5365.679
person there is a whole set of

5364.719 --> 5369.6
personality

5365.679 --> 5369.6
locked within the pool

5369.84 --> 5372.88
of their genetics

5372.96 --> 5380.4800000000005
you take you basically take

5376.639 --> 5380.4800000000005
a lot of the personalities

5380.719 --> 5385.52
from yeah the potential from within your

5383.52 --> 5389.120000000001
genetics with you

5385.52 --> 5390.8
and we have a kid they too have a whole

5389.12 --> 5393.76
range of personalities

5390.8 --> 5394.159000000001
with them that could later pop out in

5393.76 --> 5397.76
other

5394.159 --> 5400.879999999999
children or their children like

5397.76 --> 5403.360000000001
that's in my opinion how it works

5400.88 --> 5405.6
it's not cloning it's just one person

5403.36 --> 5408.88
has a lot of people with them in them

5405.6 --> 5413.120000000001
that they are not that those people

5408.88 --> 5415.6
but those people are stored within their

5413.12 --> 5418.48
potential

5415.6 --> 5421.84
it could come out of them and that

5418.48 --> 5421.839999999999
potential will persist

5426.719 --> 5429.04
what

5432.8 --> 5438.2390000000005
3.5 genetics not true whoa that's

5434.88 --> 5438.2390000000005
interesting i did not know that

5438.56 --> 5442.0
right well maybe the gna just in the

5441.199 --> 5445.759999999999
combination

5442.0 --> 5450.88
manifests that indeed other type of

5445.76 --> 5450.88
genetic things will roll out of it

5451.12 --> 5455.92
i don't know i don't know the details

5453.36 --> 5455.92
about that

5456.639 --> 5463.84
but that is very odd

5469.92 --> 5473.04
oh sure unique and special in your own

5472.32 --> 5475.04
way or

5473.04 --> 5476.239
we simply don't completely understand

5475.04 --> 5480.0
what genetics are

5476.239 --> 5482.718999999999
because maybe the genetic is just like a

5480.0 --> 5485.679
like what we see with the genetics is

5482.719 --> 5485.679
like a puzzle

5486.159 --> 5489.44
and like how it would unfold will

5488.4 --> 5492.96
express

5489.44 --> 5495.28
what the what being will be

5492.96 --> 5497.84
it doesn't mean that it is literally a

5495.28 --> 5500.88
crossover copy just like that

5497.84 --> 5502.96
it might be secondary to the actual

5500.88 --> 5505.04
mechanism that determines

5502.96 --> 5506.2390000000005
what is coming out of it so the genetics

5505.04 --> 5509.84
may not be

5506.239 --> 5509.839999999999
what we think it is in that sense

5510.88 --> 5517.4400000000005
it may be secondary to like a designer

5515.36 --> 5519.199
design thing that we simply never even

5517.44 --> 5521.04
get to see

5519.199 --> 5523.839999999999
i don't know this this is kind of wild

5521.04 --> 5527.04
at this point i'm not sure

5523.84 --> 5528.56
don't pin me on this like i

5527.04 --> 5530.639
this is the first time i've been hearing

5528.56 --> 5532.56
of that 3.5

5530.639 --> 5547.84
of your dna does not come from your

5532.56 --> 5547.84
parents i'd never heard of that before

5552.719 --> 5556.8
but maybe it does kind of work like that

5554.88 --> 5559.36
just like

5556.8 --> 5560.08
the genetics from both parents kind of

5559.36 --> 5563.36
like split

5560.08 --> 5566.639
up they come together

5563.36 --> 5570.5599999999995
and then there might be as

5566.639 --> 5572.88
it were gaps that will always be there

5570.56 --> 5574.320000000001
in certain type of combinations and then

5572.88 --> 5576.96
maybe

5574.32 --> 5580.08
the genetic code will just fill itself

5576.96 --> 5584.32
in naturally to fill those gaps

5580.08 --> 5587.04
it's a very vague explanation

5584.32 --> 5589.84
but it might be that that is what causes

5587.04 --> 5589.84
that to happen

5598.56 --> 5602.080000000001
who knows maybe it's even like that that

5600.56 --> 5603.92
even if you cut off

5602.08 --> 5606.08
like certain let's just say that

5603.92 --> 5607.4400000000005
somebody's genetics were universally

5606.08 --> 5610.88
damaged

5607.44 --> 5613.919999999999
in their conception then maybe when

5610.88 --> 5616.2390000000005
they procreate that damage does not

5613.92 --> 5619.36
necessarily have to continue maybe

5616.239 --> 5621.919999999999
how it was damaged the damage will undo

5619.36 --> 5625.28
itself in the procreation

5621.92 --> 5631.84
because it is made to fill in the gaps

5625.28 --> 5631.84
maybe that will happen i don't know

5632.08 --> 5637.12
and maybe when the genetic gap or damage

5634.719 --> 5638.719
is too big then it can't properly fill

5637.12 --> 5640.8
itself in and then certain type of

5638.719 --> 5644.88
aberrations will stick

5640.8 --> 5648.8
maybe that's how it works this is all

5644.88 --> 5648.8
yeah spitballing on my part now

5649.44 --> 5653.28
maybe that's the soul no i wouldn't say

5652.0 --> 5656.8
the soul is

5653.28 --> 5660.08
it's just yeah that's supernatural

5656.8 --> 5661.6
i just say that the actual mechanism of

5660.08 --> 5664.4
what genetics is

5661.6 --> 5665.360000000001
might be misunderstood so it wouldn't be

5664.4 --> 5668.32
the first time

5665.36 --> 5670.08
right remember discovery of epigenetics

5668.32 --> 5672.08
it already revealed that the direct

5670.08 --> 5673.76
influence of genetics doesn't even seem

5672.08 --> 5674.96
to be that dramatic it's much more about

5673.76 --> 5679.92
epigenetics that

5674.96 --> 5679.92
causes the short-term changes

5680.239 --> 5683.678999999999
over generations and even within the

5682.08 --> 5686.32
generation

5683.679 --> 5687.1990000000005
and yeah it might simply be that

5686.32 --> 5690.799999999999
genetics

5687.199 --> 5690.799999999999
are kind of secondary

5692.8 --> 5697.1990000000005
so that when they supposedly cross over

5695.119 --> 5698.639
it's not the genetics literally that

5697.199 --> 5702.159
cross over it is the

5698.639 --> 5705.04
primary thing that crosses over and then

5702.159 --> 5705.92
genetics are newly formed because of

5705.04 --> 5708.8
that

5705.92 --> 5710.96
and we simply mistake it because the

5708.8 --> 5715.84
genetics is what we focus on

5710.96 --> 5715.84
something in that direction

5732.639 --> 5743.84
like that

5744.32 --> 5750.48
a child will acknowledge the parrots

5748.159 --> 5753.119
no child does not have a conception of

5750.48 --> 5753.119
genetics

5753.28 --> 5758.32
what usually makes a child in my opinion

5755.44 --> 5758.32
connect is

5759.6 --> 5765.04
the synchronicity of the spirit because

5762.4 --> 5768.159
it is derived

5765.04 --> 5770.56
from the parents the spirit will just be

5768.159 --> 5772.239
able to connect very directly and a

5770.56 --> 5774.56
child is very open

5772.239 --> 5776.239
and basically will always start out

5774.56 --> 5776.56
doing that and i think that is really

5776.239 --> 5779.119
what

5776.56 --> 5779.119000000001
does that

5781.36 --> 5784.639
like that's it like children when

5784.159 --> 5786.19
they're

5784.639 --> 5788.0
for example adopted

5786.19 --> 5792.239
[Music]

5788.0 --> 5794.159
as baby they will just recognize their

5792.239 --> 5795.36
their adoption parents if they're very

5794.159 --> 5797.36
good or

5795.36 --> 5800.159
and then be alienated from their

5797.36 --> 5801.679
original genetic parents

5800.159 --> 5803.839999999999
they might never experience that

5801.679 --> 5806.96
synchronicity or they might

5803.84 --> 5810.4800000000005
grow into it again

5806.96 --> 5813.92
but sometimes that just never happens

5810.48 --> 5815.919999999999
so i think it's more about spirit

5813.92 --> 5817.119
the ability to connect on a deep level

5815.92 --> 5821.119
spiritually

5817.119 --> 5827.839999999999
rather than it has to do with genetics

5821.119 --> 5827.839999999999
anyway i'll be back in a minute

5921.28 --> 5925.44
ah junk dna well zack sterling junk dna

5924.719 --> 5929.44
is

5925.44 --> 5930.0
doesn't exist that's a complete like

5929.44 --> 5932.32
junk

5930.0 --> 5934.159
the concept of junk dna was already

5932.32 --> 5936.88
thrown overboard

5934.159 --> 5939.839999999999
entirely once it was discovered about

5936.88 --> 5939.84
epigenetics

5945.36 --> 5953.839999999999
right that was early stage genetics

5948.4 --> 5953.839999999999
very foolish

5954.4 --> 5958.15
[Music]

5961.6 --> 5963.84
hmm

5965.199 --> 5981.839999999999
the discoveries is not junk dna after

5967.52 --> 5981.84
all exactly

6009.84 --> 6014.32
that's a great question for quantum

6011.679 --> 6023.84
eraser what

6014.32 --> 6023.84
what is

6044.4 --> 6051.839999999999
hey hello de la fila elfinor

6063.28 --> 6066.5599999999995
they look like people

6068.56 --> 6079.84
well in your dreams they might

6088.56 --> 6092.88
downward bias yeah almost didn't even

6090.719 --> 6097.199
talk about it

6092.88 --> 6097.1990000000005
yeah downward bias is for the dense

6098.0 --> 6102.4
i hope you'll understand what that means

6100.56 --> 6107.84
after listening to nathan oakley's

6102.4 --> 6107.839999999999
streams twice yesterday

6110.719 --> 6114.88
but yeah today it seems like we're

6112.32 --> 6118.48
talking more about esoterics versus

6114.88 --> 6121.6
physics and all that

6118.48 --> 6122.638999999999
i i me mostly trying to emphasize keep

6121.6 --> 6124.639
them apart

6122.639 --> 6126.400000000001
just because they overlay doesn't mean

6124.639 --> 6126.8
that you can just surgically connect

6126.4 --> 6129.36
them

6126.8 --> 6130.0
and be all right that's not a wise thing

6129.36 --> 6132.159
to do

6130.0 --> 6134.239
trust me i've done that in the past it

6132.159 --> 6137.28
never yields

6134.239 --> 6137.28
it it's bad

6139.76 --> 6144.159000000001
so not so much talking about the

6141.28 --> 6144.159
downward bias

6147.52 --> 6151.280000000001
it's just people that can't let it go

6149.76 --> 6153.84
like they they can't

6151.28 --> 6155.759999999999
i don't know why but it's just like okay

6153.84 --> 6158.400000000001
relative density goes in these both

6155.76 --> 6158.400000000001
directions

6158.56 --> 6165.84
the passive displacement and they just

6162.4 --> 6168.638999999999
keep on no no no not equal no no no

6165.84 --> 6169.76
it bi is one day it has to be one way

6168.639 --> 6173.04
because then they can

6169.76 --> 6177.84
sort of fantasize about some sort of

6173.04 --> 6177.84
gravity again i guess it's very weird

6183.6 --> 6187.52
nobody is slow well there's a lot of

6186.639 --> 6189.76
people out there

6187.52 --> 6190.96
samson that or a lot i don't know how

6189.76 --> 6193.04
many there's eve

6190.96 --> 6195.84
well there are some people at least that

6193.04 --> 6199.679
keep hanging on to that

6195.84 --> 6202.159000000001
downward bias even though they're not

6199.679 --> 6202.159
ballers

6203.76 --> 6208.08
it was pretty hilarious yesterday like

6206.159 --> 6209.759999999999
when rumpus even started to

6208.08 --> 6212.239
when they started to go back and forth

6209.76 --> 6217.4400000000005
like between baller and

6212.239 --> 6219.919999999999
yeah downward bias flat earthers

6217.44 --> 6221.36
just so weird to hear that just kept on

6219.92 --> 6223.28
going and going and like no

6221.36 --> 6224.719
my just so story is better than you're

6223.28 --> 6226.0
just so story

6224.719 --> 6227.92
i don't know but you made all these

6226.0 --> 6230.239
mistakes and yeah but you make these

6227.92 --> 6233.84
mistakes all the time

6230.239 --> 6233.839999999999
it just never ends

6248.4 --> 6253.44
design is a man-made conception no

6251.119 --> 6253.44
that's

6253.84 --> 6260.4800000000005
why are you saying that the realm

6257.44 --> 6261.5199999999995
was designed by a man are you saying

6260.48 --> 6264.239
that their creator

6261.52 --> 6264.2390000000005
is a man

6264.719 --> 6270.159
it's a little far-fetched

6272.84 --> 6275.84
perhaps

6277.28 --> 6284.8
no things are designed it's not man-made

6281.44 --> 6286.879999999999
man utilizes design

6284.8 --> 6288.96
but the concept of designing was always

6286.88 --> 6291.52
there because the realm is designed it

6288.96 --> 6291.52
has to be

6301.28 --> 6304.719
draw it from our psyche

6305.52 --> 6313.84
the concept oh you mean like all

6308.719 --> 6313.84
information that comes from god inside

6314.4 --> 6319.28
well that that's not from man it's

6317.36 --> 6322.159
supernatural

6319.28 --> 6322.159
our psyche

6322.639 --> 6331.84
what is a psyche

6333.6 --> 6336.639
i don't use the terminology psyche

6335.679 --> 6340.32
because it is

6336.639 --> 6343.679
atheist it's not our mind

6340.32 --> 6346.96
our mind is a tool our subconscious

6343.679 --> 6348.56
is yeah

6346.96 --> 6351.04
is our conscious outside of our

6348.56 --> 6351.04
conscious

6351.199 --> 6359.839999999999
but a psyche is like a terminology that

6355.04 --> 6359.84
doesn't really is not very esoteric

6361.36 --> 6364.639
it's more mechanical based on atheism

6364.4 --> 6369.199
and

6364.639 --> 6369.1990000000005
psychology like psychiatry and all that

6369.44 --> 6372.48
and within that it's extremely vague

6371.84 --> 6375.28
mind you

6372.48 --> 6376.718999999999
it's not even a complete oversight over

6375.28 --> 6379.04
the actual experience

6376.719 --> 6379.76
it's degraded in my opinion but i don't

6379.04 --> 6382.8
know maybe

6379.76 --> 6387.84
i've used the word psyche before it's

6382.8 --> 6387.84
just very vague

6406.4 --> 6412.96
the derived design from our mind

6409.44 --> 6417.839999999999
no the mind is just the tool

6412.96 --> 6417.84
that builds it

6418.88 --> 6427.52
it is our spirit our

6423.28 --> 6430.719
will and vision

6427.52 --> 6431.1990000000005
that allows you to engage and let the

6430.719 --> 6443.84
mind

6431.199 --> 6443.839999999999
build the vision

6449.36 --> 6457.839999999999
intuition and divine inspiration can you

6451.679 --> 6457.84
tell the difference

6464.0 --> 6467.52
all right see you later de la fila

6466.239 --> 6471.839999999999
elfinor

6467.52 --> 6471.84
thanks for popping by merry christmas

6486.32 --> 6492.5599999999995
hmm well [ __ ] wassel the good point

6490.56 --> 6495.6
was so clever to make us consider an

6492.56 --> 6497.92
existence that didn't need a designer

6495.6 --> 6499.280000000001
self-designed universe it's ridiculous

6497.92 --> 6502.08
but it's also playing

6499.28 --> 6505.04
into a certain need a need for

6502.08 --> 6507.5199999999995
independence so it's like

6505.04 --> 6507.5199999999995
kind of a

6508.4 --> 6517.199
teenage young adult

6512.88 --> 6518.96
driven concept it will appeal to people

6517.199 --> 6523.28
of that age

6518.96 --> 6523.28
because it emphasizes independence

6523.36 --> 6526.5599999999995
like you want to be independent from

6525.28 --> 6529.28
your parents

6526.56 --> 6530.0
well so on an intellectual level might

6529.28 --> 6532.32
you

6530.0 --> 6534.48
have yeah feel it's okay to be

6532.32 --> 6536.5599999999995
independent from god and basically

6534.48 --> 6540.08
keep him out of the picture entirely and

6536.56 --> 6542.639
see if there's another way

6540.08 --> 6555.84
right that's what it's playing into in

6542.639 --> 6555.84
my opinion

6571.599 --> 6574.88
a muffed up new year i don't know what

6574.08 --> 6579.679
that means

6574.88 --> 6579.679
voynich don't be a pessimist

6580.56 --> 6584.320000000001
how many hoaxes and false flags yeah but

6583.92 --> 6587.4400000000005
there's

6584.32 --> 6590.639
also a widespread awakening like

6587.44 --> 6591.919999999999
really doesn't make all the newly

6590.639 --> 6593.4400000000005
awakened perfect

6591.92 --> 6595.52
they're all dealing with their own

6593.44 --> 6597.678999999999
struggles in their own sloppiness

6595.52 --> 6600.2390000000005
their indulgences from the past they all

6597.679 --> 6603.92
have to get over that now

6600.239 --> 6605.44
and might fail but there is a widespread

6603.92 --> 6607.84
awakening and there's just

6605.44 --> 6608.879999999999
a whole lot of resistance building i

6607.84 --> 6612.8
wouldn't say that

6608.88 --> 6612.8
everything is all doomed at all

6615.92 --> 6627.04
prodigal son type scenario what

6625.04 --> 6629.5199999999995
because yeah the hoaxes and the false

6627.04 --> 6631.5199999999995
flags they don't work as well as they

6629.52 --> 6634.4800000000005
used to

6631.52 --> 6636.639
or rather they could have worked as well

6634.48 --> 6640.4
if they'd started to

6636.639 --> 6640.400000000001
not be as overt about it

6640.48 --> 6646.879999999999
and now this level that they are trying

6644.239 --> 6648.4
there's just a lot of people aware to

6646.88 --> 6651.04
that it's going on now

6648.4 --> 6651.679
for real they cannot be tricked or peer

6651.04 --> 6653.679
pressured

6651.679 --> 6655.28
out of into thinking that it's real

6653.679 --> 6660.639
anymore as easily

6655.28 --> 6664.08
you see even in among the regular people

6660.639 --> 6666.0
so it's a big difference it's like a

6664.08 --> 6668.639
spiritual natural revolution

6666.0 --> 6670.719
building and should not be

6668.639 --> 6675.28
underestimated what it does because

6670.719 --> 6678.719
all of the trickery still persists

6675.28 --> 6679.44
mostly based on the majority going along

6678.719 --> 6683.119
with it

6679.44 --> 6687.28
it was always that and now

6683.119 --> 6687.28
that's changing

6688.48 --> 6694.799999999999
because yeah even the normies

6692.239 --> 6696.159
the regulars are getting literally sick

6694.8 --> 6699.76
of it

6696.159 --> 6701.28
they're starting to really climb out of

6699.76 --> 6709.84
their position of just

6701.28 --> 6709.84
full out trust so

6710.56 --> 6717.679
what do you think is on truther level

6714.719 --> 6723.84
god just check what you type before you

6717.679 --> 6723.84

6724.88 --> 6730.32
truther level what does that mean what

6727.199 --> 6730.32
is truth or level

6734.84 --> 6739.76
that's

6736.4 --> 6739.759999999999
what is a truther level

6743.36 --> 6747.839999999999
there's a lot of people that are awake

6745.52 --> 6751.280000000001
to situations and that responds

6747.84 --> 6754.400000000001
terribly or get caught up in

6751.28 --> 6757.44
a paranoid cycles and all that

6754.4 --> 6760.239
does that make them truther level what

6757.44 --> 6765.839999999999
is truther level that is like

6760.239 --> 6765.839999999999
extremely convoluted

6775.199 --> 6778.32
space force will protect us from the

6776.88 --> 6783.52
coming alien invasion

6778.32 --> 6783.5199999999995
