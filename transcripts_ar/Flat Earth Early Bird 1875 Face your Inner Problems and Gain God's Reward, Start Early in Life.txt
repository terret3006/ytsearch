really I appreciate it I will I will

1578.2 --> 1581.44
take care of myself don't

1582.279 --> 1587.72
worry it's like the ancestral winds are

1585.0 --> 1589.48
running strong I'm having it my roommate

1587.72 --> 1591.279
is having it all kinds of people are

1589.48 --> 1595.559
having it right now it's

1591.279 --> 1595.559
like it's an early March or

1599.88 --> 1604.919
something so people are going to go

1602.159 --> 1607.5590000000002
nutty going to go sickish perhaps or at

1604.919 --> 1610.3600000000001
least that's what I'm noticing here I

1607.559 --> 1612.24
mean it maybe where you're at it's not

1610.36 --> 1615.399
that bad maybe it's like specifically

1612.24 --> 1619.32
the Netherlands it's just it's

1615.399 --> 1622.4799999999998
around and it bothers me

1619.32 --> 1624.4399999999998
and I have that more often but like

1622.48 --> 1627.96
recently it's just been like pretty

1624.44 --> 1627.96
piled on and I'm having some

1630.24 --> 1636.279
trouble yeah with it periodically so but

1633.96 --> 1636.279
I'm

1637.399 --> 1645.039
okay like I'm not literally panicking or

1641.44 --> 1649.3990000000001
something it's just that I'm not in a

1645.039 --> 1651.96
super joyful mood unfortunately

1649.399 --> 1654.78
but like I'm not going to go rage win or

1651.96 --> 1657.96
anything that would always only make it

1654.78 --> 1657.96
[Music]

1658.6 --> 1664.1999999999998
worse

1661.2 --> 1666.44
and I can still talk about subjects that

1664.2 --> 1669.519
actually works really

1666.44 --> 1672.6000000000001
well like I feel uncomfortable but I do

1669.519 --> 1675.159
have like room

1672.6 --> 1678.3
to to dig into

1675.159 --> 1680.679
things it's actually a pleasant

1678.3 --> 1682.96
[Music]

1680.679 --> 1684.88
distraction but it's got to be like if

1682.96 --> 1686.3990000000001
it's going to be about some moon landing

1684.88 --> 1689.1200000000001
thing or something like that it just

1686.399 --> 1689.12
kind of bores

1695.12 --> 1698.559
me I don't

1703.039 --> 1709.64
care yeah yeah it Triplex I am at least

1707.84 --> 1711.6399999999999
at the state where I'm not getting angry

1709.64 --> 1714.8400000000001
at the trolls

1711.64 --> 1714.8400000000001
anymore right

1715.6 --> 1722.8799999999999
now I'm actively like fending it off

1720.0 --> 1727.2
because like there's no

1722.88 --> 1727.2
point I like i' only get

1729.159 --> 1736.0
sicker right so Arwin can't always be

1732.84 --> 1738.8799999999999
like super strong energetic or whatever

1736.0 --> 1740.799
and yeah I mean it's happened in the

1738.88 --> 1743.7990000000002
past I've been here for what now eight

1740.799 --> 1747.36
years nine years almost I

1743.799 --> 1747.36
think and uh

1749.84 --> 1756.4399999999998
yeah sometimes I'm just not

1753.2 --> 1760.3990000000001
optimal but I mean I get through

1756.44 --> 1764.2
it I'm I'm here to prove that I got

1760.399 --> 1764.1999999999998
through those things so and I will

1766.32 --> 1769.32
again

1776.519 --> 1779.76
hey dupons good to see

1788.64 --> 1793.519
you do blueo yeah I thought I gave him a

1791.36 --> 1796.32
wrench he I think he deserves it

1793.519 --> 1799.32
although we'll see what

1796.32 --> 1799.32
happens

1799.63 --> 1802.8290000000002
[Music]

1810.48 --> 1815.64
I mean he's certainly like done his best

1813.44 --> 1819.0800000000002
to like properly defend me everywhere

1815.64 --> 1819.0800000000002
it's like

1823.72 --> 1829.88
yeah and he gets the rules like he knows

1826.559 --> 1832.96
it's not there to just start timing out

1829.88 --> 1835.24
people or anything it's mostly to check

1832.96 --> 1838.88
people

1835.24 --> 1841.36
out like their Channel History Etc and

1838.88 --> 1844.64
to post links that's and

1841.36 --> 1844.6399999999999
hey quite

1848.44 --> 1854.72
useful duper got banned on flat side of

1852.399 --> 1856.2399999999998
course he

1854.72 --> 1859.24
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1859.24
did

1893.08 --> 1897.519
okay that's cool thanks

1902.74 --> 1905.96
[Music]

1916.159 --> 1919.159
yes

1946.08 --> 1949.08
e

1985.84 --> 1991.32
is the weed

1988.32 --> 1991.32
going

1992.72 --> 1999.519
uh

1995.0 --> 2002.799
what you grow Oh

1999.519 --> 2002.799
okay that's

2005.96 --> 2008.96
cool

2009.54 --> 2012.6599999999999
[Music]

2014.12 --> 2016.6789999999999
hey I'm

2029.679 --> 2033.88
TRC that's ridiculous on

2035.96 --> 2038.96
TRC

2046.919 --> 2051.8
yes duper I know that's why I didn't

2049.72 --> 2052.7599999999998
that's why I've subscribed a while ago I

2051.8 --> 2056.96
mean

2052.76 --> 2060.0
it's I don't really want to hang around

2056.96 --> 2063.879
there it's just not worth my

2060.0 --> 2065.879
time like I'd rather like just click on

2063.879 --> 2070.679
Earth Awakenings or

2065.879 --> 2070.679
something at least they have some order

2073.76 --> 2077.5200000000004
there or otherwise

2077.599 --> 2083.2400000000002
24/7 right but flat soid no and besides

2081.44 --> 2087.44
he's always like streaming on Like An

2083.24 --> 2087.4399999999996
Inconvenient time slot

2095.879 --> 2098.879
anyway

2125.8 --> 2130.88
what who are you talking to carrots on

2152.04 --> 2158.88
fire right in to the point videos get

2156.2 --> 2161.68
real potential to wake people up maybe

2158.88 --> 2161.6800000000003
it'll depend

2161.8 --> 2165.88
duper for some people it

2166.2 --> 2171.16
might but I mean it's mostly about the

2168.92 --> 2174.6800000000003
timing anyway if you're not feeling it

2171.16 --> 2174.68
you're just going to click it away

2182.079 --> 2188.7200000000003
anyway right and besides

2185.72 --> 2188.72
like

2188.839 --> 2193.72
it's you got to also prioritize right

2191.839 --> 2197.56
now okay so the world is like under

2193.72 --> 2200.24
great strain I mean in many aspects like

2197.56 --> 2203.04
waking people up can like

2200.24 --> 2205.319
really like make them lose their [ __ ]

2203.04 --> 2207.48
right now you got to be kind of careful

2205.319 --> 2207.48
I

2207.8 --> 2212.6400000000003
think right you got to realize that what

2210.359 --> 2215.04
you're going to see out there is mostly

2212.64 --> 2218.2799999999997
people that are already

2215.04 --> 2220.56
awakened and people that are like

2218.28 --> 2223.079
actively chose to ignore

2220.56 --> 2225.2
it and they'll just be offended if you

2223.079 --> 2228.2000000000003
try to wake them

2225.2 --> 2228.2
up

2228.359 --> 2235.7599999999998
so right to wake people up is

2231.72 --> 2238.52
better in calmer times or in time of

2235.76 --> 2240.76
relief because then it's like oh you get

2238.52 --> 2243.96
over things and then you're like oh well

2240.76 --> 2247.0
what what do we do next is there

2243.96 --> 2249.16
something I could dig into right but if

2247.0 --> 2251.079
you're in the middle of like Wars and

2249.16 --> 2253.24
[ __ ] and crazy [ __ ] happening in

2251.079 --> 2256.28
politics like people are like not really

2253.24 --> 2256.2799999999997
all that open-minded

2260.079 --> 2267.96
anyway especially about things like Flat

2263.599 --> 2270.96
Earth it's like not now is what you

2267.96 --> 2270.96
get

2271.48 --> 2276.359
so and besides currently I am more

2274.48 --> 2277.359
concerned about just the future of the

2276.359 --> 2283.0789999999997
nation

2277.359 --> 2283.0789999999997
in in Europe and America

2285.88 --> 2290.6800000000003
entirely you can start to really feel

2288.119 --> 2294.079
the tension also like in the in the crew

2290.68 --> 2296.16
with Info Wars like they are like on top

2294.079 --> 2298.119
of these things and you I can literally

2296.16 --> 2299.319
feel their tension like they're all

2298.119 --> 2303.28
getting kind of

2299.319 --> 2303.2799999999997
nervous probably for good

2305.079 --> 2310.04
reason Alex is been giving a lot of

2307.48 --> 2312.0
hopeful like esoteric insights like oh

2310.04 --> 2315.16
it gets more

2312.0 --> 2317.079
tense because we're winning and in a way

2315.16 --> 2320.319
they are winning the information war is

2317.079 --> 2322.92
being won by the awakened side

2320.319 --> 2327.16
mostly but I

2322.92 --> 2327.16
mean it's still very

2335.52 --> 2338.52
heavy

2350.76 --> 2358.2400000000002
B wi do you know what he

2353.52 --> 2361.72
means Ballwin that's my thing it's not

2358.24 --> 2363.8799999999997
Baldwin it's Ballwin that's me

2361.72 --> 2367.839
doing a

2363.88 --> 2370.839
glober like I will am

2367.839 --> 2370.839
naive

2370.96 --> 2376.88
glober that's like of a sort of a

2374.24 --> 2379.2
subconscious anti flat

2376.88 --> 2382.8
earther it's something that I was doing

2379.2 --> 2385.8799999999997
all the time like I figure I invented

2382.8 --> 2388.5600000000004
that sort of I mean other people have

2385.88 --> 2390.4
tried I'm just really good at it and I

2388.56 --> 2393.7599999999998
did that on Nathan's show earlier

2390.4 --> 2397.359
because talking about like starting four

2393.76 --> 2400.079
years ago five years ago perhaps because

2397.359 --> 2403.64
the globers were just too

2400.079 --> 2405.4
nasty and they would like get kicked out

2403.64 --> 2408.0789999999997
and then there was nobody left so I was

2405.4 --> 2410.1600000000003
like okay I'll just simulate a baller

2408.079 --> 2412.52
I'll do that and it was way too

2410.16 --> 2416.319
realistic but I at least I don't get

2412.52 --> 2418.839
nasty like that's a trademark

2416.319 --> 2423.24
Ballwin it's like Ballwin does not get

2418.839 --> 2423.24
nasty unlike a lot of anti flat

2425.119 --> 2429.599
earthers so that's what he was talking

2431.44 --> 2436.56
about right but I can't do that now

2455.319 --> 2458.319
like

2467.92 --> 2473.4
yeah now I remember you from way at

2470.16 --> 2476.48
first and at first I was also like proo

2473.4 --> 2478.64
you have a very weird way of writing I

2476.48 --> 2482.72
thought you were kind of a

2478.64 --> 2488.24
troll but it turns out you're

2482.72 --> 2488.24
not you just have dyslexia or something

2489.76 --> 2495.76
but it's

2491.24 --> 2495.7599999999998
cool like don't worry about

2495.8 --> 2503.1600000000003
it blows your mind how much info I

2499.24 --> 2506.359
have it's it's my

2503.16 --> 2509.52
life it's what I've always like I have

2506.359 --> 2512.48
that info and comparatively the rest of

2509.52 --> 2515.56
my life is kind of not that

2512.48 --> 2519.04
elaborate so because I kind of that

2515.56 --> 2521.0789999999997
that's here go here goes the troll

2519.04 --> 2524.7599999999998
that's what a wizard

2521.079 --> 2527.0
does it's like I was just like knowledge

2524.76 --> 2528.8390000000004
to a higher fractal degree and that's my

2527.0 --> 2532.359
life and the rest is

2528.839 --> 2534.359
like inconsequential I mean it's

2532.359 --> 2538.119
important to keep

2534.359 --> 2541.2
myself safe to keep myself strong enough

2538.119 --> 2543.119
and presentable enough Etc but that's

2541.2 --> 2546.96
how I see it like everything is

2543.119 --> 2550.1600000000003
secondary to just being able to gather

2546.96 --> 2553.76
refined and being able to express and

2550.16 --> 2555.48
explain to other people that aren't that

2553.76 --> 2559.28
complicated in their

2555.48 --> 2562.04
minds information especially esoteric

2559.28 --> 2565.0
information the information about things

2562.04 --> 2567.16
that just happen and people don't really

2565.0 --> 2568.52
talk about it because it's so elusive

2567.16 --> 2571.0789999999997
you don't really know what to call it

2568.52 --> 2573.119
it's just like yeah that just happens

2571.079 --> 2575.8390000000004
those

2573.119 --> 2578.1600000000003
things this big part big part of my

2575.839 --> 2580.0
special it's also what Rudolph Steiner

2578.16 --> 2584.68
was continually

2580.0 --> 2588.319
doing and I'm like picking it up on that

2584.68 --> 2591.7999999999997
level did it very early very

2588.319 --> 2595.68
young didn't have a lot of like At first

2591.8 --> 2595.6800000000003
I could basically only do that with my

2596.4 --> 2602.7200000000003
parents and then

2599.68 --> 2605.0789999999997
later a little bit with some friends but

2602.72 --> 2607.4399999999996
it was still risky and then really with

2605.079 --> 2610.52
flat Earth it that that entire thing

2607.44 --> 2613.68
just open up like a book like now is the

2610.52 --> 2615.88
time to just completely develop that to

2613.68 --> 2617.2
finally manifest all those things that

2615.88 --> 2619.319
has been kind of sitting in the

2617.2 --> 2622.359
background for a very long

2619.319 --> 2626.2799999999997
time including Visions right including

2622.359 --> 2626.2799999999997
that Vision exp that I would never talk

2626.839 --> 2629.839
about

2635.079 --> 2638.079
so

2644.76 --> 2651.88
right so I try to have good info and

2648.24 --> 2654.5589999999997
like yeah okay the info that you'll get

2651.88 --> 2657.6400000000003
here is not going to make you oh you're

2654.559 --> 2661.8390000000004
going to be the big ass winner with the

2657.64 --> 2665.0
Bugatti or something yeah that's not

2661.839 --> 2668.0
me quite the opposite in a

2665.0 --> 2668.0
way

2673.079 --> 2676.4
if anything like I've kind of done a vow

2675.599 --> 2680.119
of

2676.4 --> 2684.52
poverty because it's too risky money is

2680.119 --> 2688.119
too risky to like really throw myself at

2684.52 --> 2692.24
that and like doing that as a as a

2688.119 --> 2694.96
baseline like I as most people

2692.24 --> 2698.4799999999996
do I just can't do

2694.96 --> 2701.92
it like it ruins my entire thinking

2698.48 --> 2704.44
process it ruins the motivation to even

2701.92 --> 2704.44
uphold

2704.76 --> 2710.5200000000004
it it gets in the way so it's like in a

2708.24 --> 2713.1189999999997
metaphorically and it's a very weird

2710.52 --> 2716.24
time for it it just feels like no I I've

2713.119 --> 2717.92
chosen the life of a

2716.24 --> 2721.52
priest

2717.92 --> 2724.76
like solitary and just like focused on

2721.52 --> 2727.24
the thinking and the Purity and and like

2724.76 --> 2729.2400000000002
money is like a curse to me and the only

2727.24 --> 2734.359
reason I even like ask for money is

2729.24 --> 2734.359
because I needed to survive and get food

2734.48 --> 2740.839
right and that's

2737.16 --> 2745.319
it right and with jobs and [ __ ] that's

2740.839 --> 2746.88
always been a nightmare for me like very

2745.319 --> 2749.44
socially

2746.88 --> 2751.96
punishing like everywhere I went there

2749.44 --> 2753.96
would always be some people that just

2751.96 --> 2757.96
didn't like the look of

2753.96 --> 2762.599
me and that is like terrible to

2757.96 --> 2765.44
me like I can't survive

2762.599 --> 2769.1600000000003
there I could survive in like higher

2765.44 --> 2771.28
circles I guess but those people are all

2769.16 --> 2772.48
like have papers and they're all very

2771.28 --> 2776.2000000000003
accomplished

2772.48 --> 2779.2400000000002
and and I am not I have not integrated

2776.2 --> 2782.359
like that so I'm always kind of like

2779.24 --> 2784.4399999999996
hanging around it I mean even at fed

2782.359 --> 2786.839
that's kind of my setup if I have to be

2784.44 --> 2789.2400000000002
fair like yeah that's called honesty I

2786.839 --> 2791.72
can just do that I have no objection to

2789.24 --> 2793.2799999999997
actually be honest about that it's like

2791.72 --> 2797.24
I

2793.28 --> 2800.079
am a guy that's really not super

2797.24 --> 2802.24
accomplished except for ideas and if you

2800.079 --> 2805.44
don't recognize those ideas then I mean

2802.24 --> 2808.5589999999997
nothing to you then I'm I'm

2805.44 --> 2811.52
worthless kind of a loser then those

2808.559 --> 2813.7200000000003
ideas mean nothing to you right but

2811.52 --> 2816.319
those guys there they recognized my

2813.72 --> 2817.8799999999997
intelligence and and I worked together

2816.319 --> 2821.5589999999997
very well I'm like

2817.88 --> 2824.4
very Bravo like I want to be part of the

2821.559 --> 2827.1600000000003
group and support maybe it's more Delta

2824.4 --> 2829.48
I don't know I'm never

2827.16 --> 2833.5989999999997
sure

2829.48 --> 2837.0
but it's me again among like smarter

2833.599 --> 2839.119
people and stuff that are accomplished

2837.0 --> 2842.24
I'm smart I work together well with them

2839.119 --> 2845.119
but I'm not accomplished I'm like this

2842.24 --> 2846.24
super freelancer basically I'm an

2845.119 --> 2848.1600000000003
intellectual

2846.24 --> 2851.1189999999997
freelancer that's actually an

2848.16 --> 2854.8799999999997
interesting way to describe

2851.119 --> 2856.4
it but that Always Rings me in strange

2854.88 --> 2860.28
strange

2856.4 --> 2860.28
social hierarchical

2863.52 --> 2867.44
situations but I'm like I'm over that

2866.319 --> 2870.92
now

2867.44 --> 2873.359
that that entire pattern side effect has

2870.92 --> 2877.559
been a big grief on

2873.359 --> 2880.48
me for like

2877.559 --> 2883.079
decades it's like when I was younger

2880.48 --> 2886.319
teen argu I chose

2883.079 --> 2888.2000000000003
this but there's a lot that is really

2886.319 --> 2890.119
regrettable about

2888.2 --> 2893.04
it in

2890.119 --> 2894.48
ways it's just that I don't really have

2893.04 --> 2897.319
a

2894.48 --> 2899.2
choice and sometimes I want to have that

2897.319 --> 2902.079
it's like I but I want to have that

2899.2 --> 2904.5589999999997
choice it's like but yeah but if you do

2902.079 --> 2907.8
that it doesn't work like I find out

2904.559 --> 2911.7200000000003
every time I've right I always end up

2907.8 --> 2914.0
like yep I should have known that I just

2911.72 --> 2917.0
want to believe it's possible I want to

2914.0 --> 2919.839
believe I have this weird dream that one

2917.0 --> 2922.52
day I'll just go get a job and everybody

2919.839 --> 2924.4
will oh what a cool guy and oh this is

2922.52 --> 2926.0
awesome and oh he has some emotional

2924.4 --> 2928.559
problems well there no problem because

2926.0 --> 2930.319
he's really creative and and and

2928.559 --> 2931.559
positive about it and very constructive

2930.319 --> 2934.48
he doesn't want to bother other people

2931.559 --> 2938.88
he's awesome like that's like this dream

2934.48 --> 2938.88
of mine that just never

2939.48 --> 2944.52
happens

2941.24 --> 2947.0789999999997
and like maybe in heaven or something I

2944.52 --> 2947.079
don't know

2950.24 --> 2955.1189999999997
man

2952.04 --> 2957.72
so I'm just doing this I have to do it

2955.119 --> 2961.2400000000002
myself it it gets like this the world's

2957.72 --> 2961.24
very hostile to people that

2961.359 --> 2967.5989999999997
are very

2964.119 --> 2970.44
self-sufficient spirit itu and

2967.599 --> 2973.0
mentally it's very hostile right and I'm

2970.44 --> 2974.52
not financially self-sufficient so

2973.0 --> 2977.48
that's what they're going to attack me

2974.52 --> 2980.28
with indirectly or troll me with or

2977.48 --> 2983.28
bother me with or

2980.28 --> 2983.28

3378.24 --> 3386.0
concern watching sports is boring and

3381.96 --> 3388.88
gay H mostly

3386.0 --> 3390.76
sorry don't don't worry about it I'm not

3388.88 --> 3393.1600000000003

about like buying weed in my chat or

3393.16 --> 3398.8799999999997

3394.76 --> 3398.88
want to have in there that's

3400.12 --> 3405.249
[Music]

3409.359 --> 3413.88
all anyway thanks for all the concern

3412.0 --> 3416.88
but like I'm

3413.88 --> 3416.88
okay

3420.2 --> 3425.839
by the way if is anybody else noticing

3422.559 --> 3428.96
like people around them going

3425.839 --> 3431.92
crazy family getting sick or something

3428.96 --> 3432.68
from stress people probably are getting

3431.92 --> 3434.799
like

3432.68 --> 3436.8799999999997
overworked I think that's how it

3434.799 --> 3440.0389999999998
primarily shows is that people are

3436.88 --> 3440.039
getting like

3440.2 --> 3446.799
burnout and what I'm experienced is

3443.52 --> 3446.799
comparable to

3447.68 --> 3452.359
that I had a yeah by the way I'm

3450.039 --> 3453.76
completely I had a conversation with my

3452.359 --> 3456.96
friend from

3453.76 --> 3458.7200000000003
na yesterday who was like very esoteric

3456.96 --> 3460.839
and she knows about those things she

3458.72 --> 3463.319
knows about panic attacks like her life

3460.839 --> 3463.319
is like

3463.4 --> 3468.1600000000003
extremely

3465.64 --> 3469.72
tense it's just always surrounding her

3468.16 --> 3473.319
always

3469.72 --> 3476.48
has it's all a hassle so she like really

3473.319 --> 3478.68
knows everything about it

3476.48 --> 3480.88
and she knows a lot of people that have

3478.68 --> 3483.96
those issues and so she's like very

3480.88 --> 3485.2000000000003
helpful to talk to cuz she just really

3483.96 --> 3488.44
gets

3485.2 --> 3490.7599999999998
it and like yeah so that was a good

3488.44 --> 3492.319
conversation and she just says like yeah

3490.76 --> 3494.7990000000004
maybe you're just

3492.319 --> 3498.4
overstressed because you're always

3494.799 --> 3500.119
obsessed with doing things right and now

3498.4 --> 3501.359
suddenly like the world's going to go

3500.119 --> 3506.28
going

3501.359 --> 3508.0
nuts and that's a huge strain on that

3506.28 --> 3511.559
and she has a really good point and it

3508.0 --> 3515.68
is it's like palpable to me so when that

3511.559 --> 3518.599
that's why so hey Richard good to see

3515.68 --> 3520.839
you that's why sometimes like when I

3518.599 --> 3524.52
there's like bad news out there and I'm

3520.839 --> 3528.0789999999997
kind of feeble like it it makes me

3524.52 --> 3530.16
sick it like I feel like throwing up

3528.079 --> 3532.6800000000003
because it's like oh my God it's just

3530.16 --> 3535.5989999999997
it's too much it just feels like too

3532.68 --> 3538.359
much and now

3535.599 --> 3541.0
I am in a similar phase I have to like

3538.359 --> 3544.2
be careful now and actively consciously

3541.0 --> 3546.28
like put a subfilter in the information

3544.2 --> 3548.0789999999997
when I watch something like realizing

3546.28 --> 3550.28
like there could be coming something

3548.079 --> 3553.1600000000003
through that's like too aggressive and I

3550.28 --> 3556.28
need to like be able to cut it off

3553.16 --> 3558.839
before it reaches me when that happens

3556.28 --> 3560.96
it's very difficult to do that it

3558.839 --> 3563.64
requires like a lot of like

3560.96 --> 3566.64
Consciousness

3563.64 --> 3566.64
discipline

3566.92 --> 3570.079
right because there's just some really

3568.52 --> 3574.16
messed up things that are being thrown

3570.079 --> 3576.4
out there that are arguably

3574.16 --> 3579.52
happening not like saying it's all made

3576.4 --> 3582.44
up some of it might

3579.52 --> 3584.44
though I you can't really be sure it's

3582.44 --> 3587.44
chaos out there the psychological

3584.44 --> 3587.44
warfare

3588.24 --> 3596.5589999999997
is is growing strong I I is it peing

3593.64 --> 3597.5989999999997
maybe

3596.559 --> 3600.2400000000002
I don't

3597.599 --> 3601.96
know but I'm pretty damn sure there's a

3600.24 --> 3604.9199999999996
whole bunch of people getting caught in

3601.96 --> 3604.92
the webs of

3623.0 --> 3631.88
it Behavior mean actions okay that's

3627.96 --> 3631.88
weird derer

3633.44 --> 3641.7200000000003
yeah no and Richard is not Richard G

3637.16 --> 3641.72
this this is Richard with no

3648.37 --> 3651.7599999999998
[Music]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
G

3661.16 --> 3664.96
hey Rick back good to see you

3665.68 --> 3670.839
clear

3667.559 --> 3670.8390000000004
Jus that's

3673.52 --> 3677.599
right or no G

3677.799 --> 3682.2
Richard but anyway just calling

3683.44 --> 3686.44
Richard

3713.44 --> 3716.44
all

3726.599 --> 3729.599
spritey

3739.24 --> 3744.0389999999998
okay difficult to make an walking

3741.559 --> 3748.6800000000003
animation I've done that in the past

3744.039 --> 3748.6800000000003
right cheats and yes it can be quite

3750.039 --> 3756.559
tricky like if you have to like picture

3752.599 --> 3756.559
for picture make it that's kind of

3756.68 --> 3761.3999999999996
difficult that's where animators come in

3768.0 --> 3773.079
though

3770.079 --> 3773.079
what

3773.359 --> 3776.359

3785.83 --> 3788.96
[Music]

3798.039 --> 3803.279
moon landings more interesting than

3801.72 --> 3806.279
Cricket

3803.279 --> 3806.279
uh

3809.4 --> 3811.7200000000003
I don't

3821.68 --> 3827.799
know don't find them particularly

3825.24 --> 3830.24
interesting both of

3827.799 --> 3832.68
them although I guess moon landing would

3830.24 --> 3832.68
be more

3833.279 --> 3836.279
interesting

3838.18 --> 3843.5699999999997
[Music]

3840.039 --> 3857.539

[Music]

3863.2 --> 3867.64
fake

3866.079 --> 3870.88
where can they land

3867.64 --> 3872.6099999999997
on well not on the

3870.88 --> 3876.059
moon probably

3872.61 --> 3876.059
[Music]

3876.48 --> 3881.279
some Warehouse with a lot of sand again

3879.92 --> 3885.559
just

3881.279 --> 3885.559
some big hanger or

3885.64 --> 3891.73
something that's probably what they

3889.039 --> 3893.1600000000003
did for some of the footage at

3891.73 --> 3896.16
[Music]

3893.16 --> 3896.16
least

3898.559 --> 3902.2000000000003
Cricket is real that's

3904.079 --> 3907.7200000000003
hilarious oh

3912.3 --> 3915.449
[Music]

3923.079 --> 3926.079

3929.49 --> 3940.0099999999998
[Music]

3940.92 --> 3943.7200000000003
who's filming

3947.2 --> 3951.799
it I don't know with this recent

3949.359 --> 3954.0789999999997
moonlanding if they showed any actual

3951.799 --> 3956.68
filmed footage at all or if it was just

3954.079 --> 3958.6400000000003
full CGI representation I think they did

3956.68 --> 3961.5589999999997
it very cheap I'm not sure though I

3958.64 --> 3963.52
didn't really dive into it but from

3961.559 --> 3965.0
everything that I've heard thus far it's

3963.52 --> 3969.24
just

3965.0 --> 3969.24
been non-actual footage

3970.27 --> 3973.719
[Music]

3983.0 --> 3989.0
based

3985.96 --> 3992.68
[Music]

3989.0 --> 3992.68
D trucks full of sand yeah yeah

4002.39 --> 4006.56
[Music]

4013.0 --> 4016.0
yeah

4039.68 --> 4043.44
I got an idea for ders game but I don't

4041.72 --> 4046.4399999999996
want to throw it out yet because it's

4043.44 --> 4050.2000000000003
like too really what's the sound in the

4046.44 --> 4055.839
background oh no that's somebody's

4050.2 --> 4055.839
uh sawing wood that's what you're

4058.359 --> 4064.389
hearing there's no

4061.15 --> 4064.389
[Music]

4072.92 --> 4075.92
protesting

4078.44 --> 4083.76
derer I got an idea for you but I mean

4080.76 --> 4087.7200000000003
it's it's complicated it's going to

4083.76 --> 4090.119
probably distract you to no end you need

4087.72 --> 4094.48
to be able to build something

4090.119 --> 4094.48
first before you get into like

4096.88 --> 4100.2390000000005
complicated story

4102.839 --> 4107.899
setups

4104.72 --> 4107.899
[Music]

4111.899 --> 4123.719
[Music]

4126.96 --> 4131.0
but I mean yeah I was thinking like you

4128.96 --> 4133.52
could like even put the Dark World in

4131.0 --> 4136.88
there and just like basically make it

4133.52 --> 4139.159000000001
like a A Link to the Past setup sort of

4136.88 --> 4141.1990000000005
not the story but just like have a dark

4139.159 --> 4145.5599999999995
world where you just like go to the Dark

4141.199 --> 4149.12
World or maybe not like active using an

4145.56 --> 4149.120000000001
item but that is

4149.199 --> 4153.759
like that I would have visions and in

4151.799 --> 4155.92
the Visions you could say like oh

4153.759 --> 4158.279
whatever of that

4155.92 --> 4162.4400000000005
location like you're seeing what's

4158.279 --> 4162.4400000000005
actually happening in

4162.719 --> 4168.0
secret kind of

4164.92 --> 4168.0
thing I

4169.679 --> 4174.1990000000005
mean there I say balers gate

4172.719 --> 4177.719
storytelling

4174.199 --> 4180.5199999999995
style right what had balers gate dream

4177.719 --> 4182.04
sessions like you got dreams about oh my

4180.52 --> 4183.080000000001
God you don't know who you are what's

4182.04 --> 4184.92
happening what am I

4183.08 --> 4188.239
[Music]

4184.92 --> 4191.2390000000005
seeing and that really worked and like

4188.239 --> 4192.718999999999
in a way it's very similar to what it is

4191.239 --> 4194.61
that I

4192.719 --> 4197.28
experienced

4194.61 --> 4200.679
[Music]

4197.28 --> 4203.92
and it makes it compelling it will make

4200.679 --> 4206.84
you for the game player want to be like

4203.92 --> 4208.96
oh I want to know where this is going so

4206.84 --> 4211.159000000001
yeah there's all kinds of things you

4208.96 --> 4211.159
could

4213.2 --> 4222.719
[Music]

4217.32 --> 4225.5199999999995
do but I mean look just make something

4222.719 --> 4228.4800000000005
first

4225.52 --> 4230.719
like have a basic environment like one

4228.48 --> 4231.879999999999
region where you're a figure and you can

4230.719 --> 4234.8
walk

4231.88 --> 4237.56
around and there's other things there

4234.8 --> 4240.64
and then gradually build up like how can

4237.56 --> 4242.96
you make it that you can interact with

4240.64 --> 4245.1990000000005
other things and have dialogues and then

4242.96 --> 4248.08
just keep on building from

4245.199 --> 4250.08
that but you really you got to start

4248.08 --> 4252.64
with the basics you got to start

4250.08 --> 4254.32
building really basic

4252.64 --> 4257.0
things

4254.32 --> 4260.12
and then use those to

4257.0 --> 4262.12
start figuring out like how to do that

4260.12 --> 4265.84
more efficient and then

4262.12 --> 4269.08
eventually yeah you you can move on with

4265.84 --> 4269.08
the more complicated

4277.28 --> 4283.239
things is the dark world like the real

4280.159 --> 4286.679
world but different no but the Dark

4283.239 --> 4286.678999999999
World is about the real

4290.159 --> 4295.12
world I mean in a game you could make it

4293.28 --> 4297.4
like the real world but slightly

4295.12 --> 4300.5599999999995
different if you're really going to have

4297.4 --> 4302.719
like a Sandbox situation in there but I

4300.56 --> 4304.360000000001
was suggesting like no it's just like

4302.719 --> 4308.08
Visions

4304.36 --> 4311.04
like you dream about things that are

4308.08 --> 4315.5599999999995
decided by people out

4311.04 --> 4315.56
there for example

4320.88 --> 4324.8
what the hell are you doing

4331.88 --> 4339.639
there like what why I don't what is

4336.6 --> 4341.4800000000005
this what do you mean what about bashier

4339.639 --> 4344.2390000000005
where did you come from what the hell

4341.48 --> 4346.959999999999
does that even mean

4344.239 --> 4350.12
could people just stop throwing things

4346.96 --> 4352.6
in here that like nobody's like I never

4350.12 --> 4352.599999999999
heard of

4369.76 --> 4374.96
that oh that's in yeah you could do that

4373.199 --> 4376.599999999999
you you could make it like psychological

4374.96 --> 4378.84
there are other games that do that too

4376.6 --> 4378.84
by the

4385.56 --> 4391.280000000001
way

4387.76 --> 4391.280000000001
oh what

4402.36 --> 4405.36
okay

4425.76 --> 4432.52
ah yeah thanks thanks triple

4429.96 --> 4436.12
X thanks for the PayPal I really

4432.52 --> 4436.120000000001
appreciate that yes I got

4436.719 --> 4441.639
him thanks for the support that's

4447.12 --> 4451.08
awesome thank you for the support how

4450.12 --> 4455.5599999999995
had

4451.08 --> 4455.5599999999995
that what

4462.28 --> 4467.4
okay

4464.4 --> 4470.0
not sure why I should do that but like

4467.4 --> 4472.96
yeah in PayPal it's just there's the

4470.0 --> 4476.6
record there

4472.96 --> 4478.679
so I don't need to like actively keep

4476.6 --> 4479.719
track of it it's just it's registered

4478.679 --> 4483.92
there

4479.719 --> 4483.92
so well thank you very much for the

4492.12 --> 4495.28
support what

4497.44 --> 4500.839999999999
what what do you what do you

4501.69 --> 4507.96
[Music]

4504.36 --> 4510.679
mean you me membership of the

4507.96 --> 4513.04
channel is that still does that even

4510.679 --> 4513.04
still

4514.92 --> 4518.719
work oh yeah it's still

4519.719 --> 4525.199
working but yeah don't bother though

4526.159 --> 4531.96
I mean just money through the PayPal

4528.159 --> 4535.4
works way better for me than any super

4531.96 --> 4539.96
chats that why I turned it off oh

4535.4 --> 4542.28
patreon yeah no absolutely the patreon

4539.96 --> 4545.4
does

4542.28 --> 4547.0
work it's like a monthly thing and yeah

4545.4 --> 4549.599999999999
you can turn it off when you no one

4547.0 --> 4551.92
longer want to do it I've had a lot of

4549.6 --> 4554.4400000000005
patreon people come and go it just never

4551.92 --> 4557.28
really amounted to a lot

4554.44 --> 4561.5599999999995
people always end up just throwing at it

4557.28 --> 4564.199
throwing at me at PayPal

4561.56 --> 4566.96
mostly like Nathan has like this giant

4564.199 --> 4570.638999999999
list of patreon

4566.96 --> 4570.639
supporters me not so

4578.04 --> 4585.12
much oh if I get everything uh no they

4581.719 --> 4585.12
do take a percentage

4586.52 --> 4596.0
but I mean at like Google takes way

4590.84 --> 4599.76
more like super chats they take 40% it's

4596.0 --> 4602.159
crazy so PayPal is always been the best

4599.76 --> 4605.08
solution and there's other ways too like

4602.159 --> 4607.04
I can send you payment

4605.08 --> 4609.84
requests

4607.04 --> 4612.92
like and then you

4609.84 --> 4614.4800000000005
don't have like then there's no money

4612.92 --> 4618.08
that they take out of

4614.48 --> 4620.159
it right but you'd have to contact me

4618.08 --> 4621.92
and say like hey send me a payment

4620.159 --> 4623.638999999999
request for this much and then I send it

4621.92 --> 4625.679
to you and then there's no percentage

4623.639 --> 4627.159000000001
they take out of it that's it's been

4625.679 --> 4630.0
interesting it's not

4627.159 --> 4631.96
necessary necessarily necessary entirely

4630.0 --> 4634.36
like and I don't like want to like oh I

4631.96 --> 4636.719
don't want to cheap skate PayPal in a

4634.36 --> 4638.159
way like I'm very thankful for their

4636.719 --> 4640.36
overall

4638.159 --> 4645.0
Services I'm very happy that they

4640.36 --> 4645.0
haven't like pulled me out or anything

4646.679 --> 4650.32
so no I

4648.719 --> 4653.679
get

4650.32 --> 4656.88
uh what was it D

4653.679 --> 4656.88
it hold

4664.199 --> 4667.199

4688.199 --> 4694.759999999999
all right you send me

4690.4 --> 4694.759999999999
20 I get1

4701.92 --> 4704.92
1897

4707.32 --> 4712.679
through the

4709.159 --> 4714.679
mail uh yeah sure if well if you want to

4712.679 --> 4717.6
risk that I

4714.679 --> 4718.6
mean yeah you could send me money in the

4717.6 --> 4721.159000000001
mail

4718.6 --> 4724.320000000001
too although that's different I I would

4721.159 --> 4729.719
only be able to spend that at like like

4724.32 --> 4729.719
actual shops of course but that's yeah

4731.92 --> 4734.92
sure

4752.84 --> 4757.719
is it me or the campt trails on the

4754.32 --> 4757.719
background no that's

4759.88 --> 4767.6
you now there's no chemtrails out here

4763.84 --> 4767.6
right now it's so clouded

4768.639 --> 4774.28
anyway and I don't know what they are I

4771.8 --> 4776.320000000001
mean they keep hearing oh Chemtrails

4774.28 --> 4778.4
where is the evidence I

4776.32 --> 4779.84
mean they are definitely not

4778.4 --> 4782.04
condensation

4779.84 --> 4784.92
Trails cuz they keep

4782.04 --> 4787.5199999999995
lingering but I don't know what is in

4784.92 --> 4790.719
there I know that it has been registered

4787.52 --> 4793.040000000001
once and it's patented and all that in

4790.719 --> 4794.12
official geoengineering that they do use

4793.04 --> 4798.0
all that

4794.12 --> 4801.199
stuff but I haven't had any like direct

4798.0 --> 4804.639
evidence like yeah see we took soil

4801.199 --> 4808.719
samples it's been polluted with this for

4804.639 --> 4811.4800000000005
30 years like where is

4808.719 --> 4813.92
that where's that kind of

4811.48 --> 4815.08
information it doesn't there there isn't

4813.92 --> 4817.12
any it's just oh look at the

4815.08 --> 4818.32
geoengineering papers and just the we

4817.12 --> 4820.28
had some

4818.32 --> 4822.5199999999995
samples way

4820.28 --> 4825.28
back and so we're just going to assume

4822.52 --> 4827.080000000001
it's all that and that's my issue with

4825.28 --> 4830.759999999999
like the chemtrail

4827.08 --> 4832.48
conspiracy people that like yes there is

4830.76 --> 4836.719
legitimate concern but I get the feel

4832.48 --> 4836.718999999999
it's just being overhyped by

4837.88 --> 4846.400000000001
them fake background

4841.08 --> 4849.92
what no no absolutely no Chemtrails in

4846.4 --> 4849.92
there that would be

4851.719 --> 4854.719
crazy

4862.12 --> 4865.21
[Music]

4880.32 --> 4886.199
no yes Triplex

4884.0 --> 4888.8
PayPal does take a

4886.199 --> 4890.4
fee if you want to transfer it some

4888.8 --> 4892.92
other way I

4890.4 --> 4895.599999999999
mean technically you could transfer it

4892.92 --> 4895.6
to my bank

4899.56 --> 4904.88
account but to be fair like I'd prefer

4903.199 --> 4907.04
it just through the pay and I can send

4904.88 --> 4909.52
you

4907.04 --> 4914.639
requests

4909.52 --> 4914.639

4941.56 --> 4944.56
out

4964.88 --> 4969.12
all

4965.8 --> 4971.56
right so that can completely bypass it

4969.12 --> 4974.5599999999995
and still keep it all online so you

4971.56 --> 4974.56
don't

4974.719 --> 4980.6
have any issues okay it's a very Dutch

4978.0 --> 4980.6
Problem by the

4981.92 --> 4989.08
way I don't want to pay them a

4986.32 --> 4991.92
fee but that's I get

4989.08 --> 4995.0
it like I'm at this point just happy

4991.92 --> 4999.52
that I'm still surviving somehow with

4995.0 --> 5004.48
everything so I'm like they they want

4999.52 --> 5004.4800000000005
like I just see it as like

5005.36 --> 5011.28
what did CH say like you just have to

5008.36 --> 5014.12
pay taxes to Rome like if Rome rules

5011.28 --> 5014.12
then you have to

5015.32 --> 5022.32
like yeah like the banks are making this

5019.199 --> 5025.32
possible for me like PayPal so I'm like

5022.32 --> 5027.92
okay they they want a fee okay fair

5025.32 --> 5030.12
enough I mean I'm just happy that I can

5027.92 --> 5030.12
use

5031.48 --> 5035.638999999999
it 20 to me is like

5034.41 --> 5038.84
[Music]

5035.639 --> 5043.36
20 right but I mean

5038.84 --> 5047.8
18 97 is also like 20 to me it's

5043.36 --> 5047.799999999999
perfectly fine it's all very

5049.0 --> 5054.04
helpful

5051.4 --> 5055.239
right and it look it's nothing compared

5054.04 --> 5059.4
to like the

5055.239 --> 5064.08
paypals or to the Super Chat that Google

5059.4 --> 5067.28
actually like that's they take just 40%

5064.08 --> 5069.719
out of that I mean that's that's really

5067.28 --> 5072.4
dramatic like I'm not doing that I'm not

5069.719 --> 5075.679
being part of that no

5072.4 --> 5078.36
way like they'll just have to settle

5075.679 --> 5081.04
with the ad money right and if they want

5078.36 --> 5085.239
to get that well then they have to have

5081.04 --> 5087.6
my streams be up and visible and then

5085.239 --> 5090.04
they can get the ad money out of it

5087.6 --> 5094.360000000001
right that's the tradeoff that's the the

5090.04 --> 5094.36
business model basically so

5095.36 --> 5100.08
have Arn's Arch at the entrance yeah

5097.8 --> 5100.08
yeah

5106.22 --> 5109.379
[Music]

5109.6 --> 5116.4800000000005
maybe next 21 I get 20 okay fair enough

5113.159 --> 5116.48
that could also work

5121.28 --> 5127.119
yes

5124.28 --> 5129.679
I'm just giving you the offer you want

5127.119 --> 5132.639
you don't want to pay them a fee well

5129.679 --> 5134.4800000000005
you can but you have to then send tell

5132.639 --> 5137.36
me and then I can send you a payment

5134.48 --> 5137.36
request through

5138.88 --> 5143.32
PayPal and then you don't pay the Fe

5141.04 --> 5146.639
that's all okay this

5143.32 --> 5147.88
is although I appreciate talking about

5146.639 --> 5150.32
how I'm getting

5147.88 --> 5154.0
money this might be a little boring for

5150.32 --> 5158.799999999999
the Watchers so

5154.0 --> 5158.8
let's try to move on but yeah thanks for

5162.48 --> 5170.32
that a duper duper you are getting way

5167.28 --> 5172.5199999999995
you're getting so

5170.32 --> 5175.0
distracted I'm going to tell you duper

5172.52 --> 5177.6
you really need to get to the boring

5175.0 --> 5180.56
part and just like start building

5177.6 --> 5182.4800000000005
something and stop dreaming about like

5180.56 --> 5185.159000000001
what it's going to be like you need need

5182.48 --> 5187.718999999999
to actually start with something

5185.159 --> 5189.32
small your dreaming is just going to

5187.719 --> 5191.76
distract you I know everything about

5189.32 --> 5195.159
that how that

5191.76 --> 5198.4800000000005
works you could like make days and days

5195.159 --> 5200.5599999999995
worth of ideas of how it's going to be

5198.48 --> 5203.32
but you got to actually like have

5200.56 --> 5205.4400000000005
something that works first otherwise

5203.32 --> 5208.08
you'll have all these ideas and then it

5205.44 --> 5209.879999999999
won't work you'll run out of energy and

5208.08 --> 5211.36
then it's all for nothing and it will

5209.88 --> 5213.28
just be forgotten and nothing will

5211.36 --> 5216.08
happen

5213.28 --> 5219.44
trust me on this you just got to

5216.08 --> 5219.44
actually do

5223.18 --> 5228.479
[Music]

5240.76 --> 5247.1990000000005

thanks man I I will do my

5253.48 --> 5257.959999999999

5271.119 --> 5274.119
now

5277.0 --> 5283.71

you're such a war dog triple X

5322.36 --> 5326.679
you're they're going to attack me now

5324.56 --> 5326.679
come

5327.6 --> 5333.0
on I appreciate it

5331.0 --> 5335.119
though

5333.0 --> 5337.52
they all want yeah I know and I don't

5335.119 --> 5341.599999999999
know

5337.52 --> 5344.1990000000005
why like I couldn't imagine like being

5341.6 --> 5347.1990000000005
other people and then like not liking me

5344.199 --> 5350.119
or something and then watching my show

5347.199 --> 5352.839999999999
like that must be like super tedious

5350.119 --> 5355.32
like when I feel like I'm not doing a

5352.84 --> 5357.639
super good job and I watch it back like

5355.32 --> 5359.44
I want to shot it off like I don't get

5357.639 --> 5363.92
why do they then

5359.44 --> 5363.919999999999
watch why do you do this to yourself

5364.239 --> 5368.36
what are you

5365.36 --> 5372.44
expecting I don't get

5368.36 --> 5372.44
it Dutch team yeah yeah

5390.92 --> 5397.36
yeah right but I look I'm going to try

5394.84 --> 5400.2390000000005
to like this weekend maybe see if I can

5397.36 --> 5402.239
get some discussions going again and get

5400.239 --> 5403.839999999999
some inspiration out it's like how I got

5402.239 --> 5405.839999999999
my good show last time I went on

5403.84 --> 5408.119000000001
Earthbound and then talked about ether

5405.84 --> 5411.119000000001
with that guy and then I figured out

5408.119 --> 5413.839999999999
like hey hm stuck between

5411.119 --> 5417.799999999999
a wave assumption

5413.84 --> 5422.28
and and IM medium need like that was a

5417.8 --> 5427.92
really nice concise little tool that's

5422.28 --> 5432.32
like very strong to to uphold in the

5427.92 --> 5435.56
face of ether arguments because it's

5432.32 --> 5437.48
like it clears it up like how it's in

5435.56 --> 5439.6
aberration and like where the trick is

5437.48 --> 5441.48
it's like oh oh that speed of light yeah

5439.6 --> 5442.76
we just assume oh it's a faster speed

5441.48 --> 5445.879999999999
it's a slower speed of light yeah but

5442.76 --> 5449.04
did you actually measure it no you're

5445.88 --> 5450.84
just assuming that it is the speed that

5449.04 --> 5452.36
you're like

5450.84 --> 5454.92
changing

5452.36 --> 5458.199
and in the calculations that works out

5454.92 --> 5462.4
but you never actually measured it none

5458.199 --> 5465.36
of it makes any actual sense when you

5462.4 --> 5468.599999999999
really go to the nitty-gritty but I mean

5465.36 --> 5471.0
like yeah they just use that system and

5468.6 --> 5472.84
technologically it works so

5471.0 --> 5475.04
technologically yeah you could just call

5472.84 --> 5478.159000000001
it light speed being varied and

5475.04 --> 5480.639
manipulated doing all these things and

5478.159 --> 5482.44
then mathematically and technologically

5480.639 --> 5485.08
it works out

5482.44 --> 5487.119
but there's no actual involvement of

5485.08 --> 5490.159
speed though in

5487.119 --> 5493.759999999999
reality that's the weird thing about it

5490.159 --> 5496.799999999999
so it is like this well hidden

5493.76 --> 5500.719
aberration that's like technologically

5496.8 --> 5502.84
ingrained out of pragmatism I mean they

5500.719 --> 5505.36
I don't even think that they did like oh

5502.84 --> 5509.0
light speed assumption light speed being

5505.36 --> 5511.4
changed to to Really mess with people I

5509.0 --> 5514.52
think it just like it just that's how it

5511.4 --> 5517.799999999999
devel veloped in the

5514.52 --> 5519.639
technology so it's like yeah just

5517.8 --> 5522.84
accidentally happened there and that's

5519.639 --> 5527.159000000001
why you should very much distinct make a

5522.84 --> 5529.119000000001
distinct difference between

5527.159 --> 5532.96
engineering and

5529.119 --> 5537.679
science Natural Science because in

5532.96 --> 5540.28
engineering they can have ideas and

5537.679 --> 5543.4800000000005
descriptions that are just on theun

5540.28 --> 5545.48
about things that aren't

5543.48 --> 5547.4
scientific they have nothing to do with

5545.48 --> 5549.879999999999
that they just have to do with that

5547.4 --> 5552.879999999999
unique process that happens in a

5549.88 --> 5552.88
man-made device

5558.48 --> 5563.199
setup

5560.36 --> 5565.4
right so yeah that that episode was kind

5563.199 --> 5565.4
of

5565.52 --> 5570.639
interesting get push what oh come on

5568.28 --> 5573.639
leave teret alone though I

5570.639 --> 5573.639
mean

5575.8 --> 5583.4400000000005
I mean you do whatever you like

5579.28 --> 5583.44
but it's it's kind of

5588.05 --> 5591.569
[Music]

5598.199 --> 5603.36
pointless sock puppet yeah well when he

5601.639 --> 5606.08
shows up here he shows up with sock

5603.36 --> 5608.4
puppets but everywhere else he just has

5606.08 --> 5611.5199999999995
his normal ter 306

5608.4 --> 5615.32
account even got a wrench it Nathan

5611.52 --> 5619.2390000000005
Oakley's backup channel for some

5615.32 --> 5619.239
reason but yeah I don't

5625.6 --> 5633.56
care

5628.36 --> 5633.5599999999995
what did you stop talking about cricket

5639.119 --> 5643.759999999999
I'm G startop timing out you

5660.48 --> 5663.48

[Music]

5675.4 --> 5680.96
Cricket dream show time coding video

5679.08 --> 5684.76
okay fair

5680.96 --> 5684.76
enough well go ahead

5684.92 --> 5690.6
then I'm basically projecting onto you

5688.08 --> 5692.239
my own experiences like oh I want this

5690.6 --> 5694.1990000000005
thing to be done and then I get so

5692.239 --> 5696.799999999999
distracted by my ideas that it like

5694.199 --> 5698.0
never amounts to it I I never get to

5696.8 --> 5701.719
finish

5698.0 --> 5704.28
it there's been a lot of that in my

5701.719 --> 5705.92
life and actually the super bullet Dash

5704.28 --> 5707.36
project was one of the few things where

5705.92 --> 5709.2390000000005
that didn't happen where I did

5707.36 --> 5713.88
eventually have like a full blueprint

5709.239 --> 5718.239
about it and I still do it's

5713.88 --> 5723.400000000001
just I don't know how to program

5718.239 --> 5723.4
that hey Richard G good to see you

5750.4 --> 5753.4
ah

5756.75 --> 5759.939

e

5786.92 --> 5791.76
all right

5788.719 --> 5794.56
so what should I talk

5791.76 --> 5797.360000000001
about like I feel more concentrated I

5794.56 --> 5799.639
feel better now like took me over one

5797.36 --> 5803.04
and a half

5799.639 --> 5806.8
hour and the PayPal also helped a bit I

5803.04 --> 5806.8
mean it's always a moral boost for

5807.0 --> 5813.28
me Flat Earth yeah sure Flat Earth but I

5810.719 --> 5813.28
mean

5822.44 --> 5829.678999999999
yeah Horizon not being

5825.96 --> 5832.2390000000005
geometric like there's so little left

5829.679 --> 5835.88
really like there's just like yeah that

5832.239 --> 5838.32
the Earth is flat it's like pretty damn

5835.88 --> 5839.679
certain I just don't really know what

5838.32 --> 5843.199
else to talk

5839.679 --> 5843.1990000000005
about about it

5848.159 --> 5854.0
Indonesian food

5870.199 --> 5873.638999999999
invigorating

5872.04 --> 5877.719

5888.56 --> 5894.52
stuff myself I'll puke it out again like

5891.199 --> 5897.48
it doesn't work so but I'm cool I'm okay

5894.52 --> 5899.119000000001
don't worry about me and when I say

5897.48 --> 5902.5599999999995
that's not just to like oh stop

5899.119 --> 5904.719
inquiring no I'm actually okay okay this

5902.56 --> 5907.400000000001
is

5904.719 --> 5909.44
normal that this all my life ups and

5907.4 --> 5912.879999999999
downs ups and downs I talk about it on

5909.44 --> 5915.638999999999
my show so it's fine don't worry about

5912.88 --> 5917.76
it like worry about it when I tell you

5915.639 --> 5921.28
to worry about

5917.76 --> 5925.320000000001

5925.32 --> 5927.759999999999
sounds

5930.119 --> 5933.119
great

5934.639 --> 5938.719
right so but yeah what about Flat Earth

5936.599 --> 5938.719
you

5948.08 --> 5953.36
know can talk about it take

5951.48 --> 5956.36
notes

5953.36 --> 5956.36
what

5959.36 --> 5964.36
okay well if it's interesting in a

5962.52 --> 5966.639
conversation I usually don't have to

5964.36 --> 5966.639
take

5971.08 --> 5977.88
notes cuz then it will just literally

5973.88 --> 5979.28
integrate in My overall never ending

5977.88 --> 5984.4400000000005
cycle of

5979.28 --> 5984.44
thinking it will just sit there and be

5990.04 --> 5993.04
available

5993.56 --> 5997.679
so it's not like I have a really bad

5995.76 --> 6000.08
memory or anything it's just sometimes

5997.679 --> 6002.719
when I start my show I have to

6000.08 --> 6005.44
like it's like everything becomes blank

6002.719 --> 6008.199
all of a sudden and I have to like start

6005.44 --> 6010.04
slowly getting back to like where I was

6008.199 --> 6013.04
and remember it just it's like a weird

6010.04 --> 6013.04
little reset that

6015.56 --> 6022.52
happens oh you took R recipe from me

6019.239 --> 6024.5199999999995
that moment okay cool yeah

6022.52 --> 6029.280000000001
did did you make it

6024.52 --> 6029.280000000001
because I mean that's it's it's

6029.32 --> 6037.0
intense K chicken ketchup is

6033.32 --> 6037.0
intense the way I make

6042.8 --> 6049.28
it give you some more ye

6046.28 --> 6049.28
okay

6049.92 --> 6052.92
uh

6054.48 --> 6060.678999999999
well another kind of Asian but it's not

6057.599 --> 6062.400000000001
super Indonesian it's kind of

6060.679 --> 6065.119
generic

6062.4 --> 6070.879999999999
is like when I have

6065.119 --> 6073.598999999999
my sball vegetable walk so it just put a

6070.88 --> 6078.52
lot of different vegetables in there

6073.599 --> 6082.28
with like a basis of uh on coconut

6078.52 --> 6086.360000000001
oil lots of garlic and lots

6082.28 --> 6089.5599999999995
able and just like uh what's in there

6086.36 --> 6091.598999999999
broccoli celery green

6089.56 --> 6097.159000000001
beans

6091.599 --> 6100.639
carrot uh P soy yeah I think that's

6097.159 --> 6103.159
it you make your own SBO okay that's

6100.639 --> 6105.4800000000005
interesting but anyway

6103.159 --> 6107.92
that's that's another meal that I make

6105.48 --> 6110.239
and I just like yeah you could add rice

6107.92 --> 6111.84
on the side I don't even do that it's

6110.239 --> 6114.08
just like nope I'll just eat it just

6111.84 --> 6114.08
like

6118.159 --> 6123.199
that and that's something oh yeah and of

6121.04 --> 6126.48
course chicken they the chicken I almost

6123.199 --> 6126.48
forgot it is with

6128.84 --> 6134.2390000000005
chicken all right and hey you could make

6131.4 --> 6137.199
like Indonesian cooking with like other

6134.239 --> 6140.44
things too like pork and all that I just

6137.199 --> 6142.119
never do that I never take pork it's

6140.44 --> 6144.919999999999
like it's not

6142.119 --> 6146.04
necessary to do that like you could do

6144.92 --> 6148.8
like

6146.04 --> 6151.4
everything Asian just with chicken and

6148.8 --> 6151.400000000001
it works

6155.36 --> 6161.88
fantastically although I'm sure

6158.639 --> 6162.84
that a lot of people really love sweet

6161.88 --> 6166.400000000001
sour

6162.84 --> 6168.679
pork or that kind of stuff it's but no

6734.679 --> 6739.079
it

6736.199 --> 6741.879999999999

6757.28 --> 6762.599

6762.599 --> 6767.52
touch it and you die or you

6764.84 --> 6768.84
become evil or so I've heard of that

6768.84 --> 6772.1990000000005
mean

6770.599 --> 6774.56
yeah that's not the black goo we're

6772.199 --> 6774.5599999999995
talking

6778.28 --> 6783.119
about and I don't know if that's real

6792.4 --> 6798.199
even it just seemed like a whole bunch

6794.76 --> 6801.639
of like at the time nanot Technology

6798.199 --> 6803.759999999999
based fear porn

6801.639 --> 6807.36
that's what it seemed like to

6803.76 --> 6809.92
me and it just looked like a giant

6807.36 --> 6812.92
distraction potentially concocted by the

6809.92 --> 6815.56
CIA as a fear porn story for people to

6812.92 --> 6818.159
be paranoid about serious I think that

6815.56 --> 6819.96
that is actually what it was but I don't

6818.159 --> 6822.0
know maybe there's more to it or

6819.96 --> 6824.88
something I never really got too deep

6822.0 --> 6827.96
into it it just felt like this

6824.88 --> 6832.079
is blatant programming that's what it

6827.96 --> 6832.079
felt like to me when I bumped into into

7049.679 --> 7054.599
came from

7050.92 --> 7056.92
him the evolution human evolved by

7054.599 --> 7059.52
monkeys eating mushroom seriously that's

7056.92 --> 7065.159

7515.0 --> 7520.96
tricking fungus yeah fungus is fungus I

7518.84 --> 7526.8

7520.96 --> 7526.8
it's there without fungus there's no

7527.28 --> 7532.199
nature a ground that doesn't have fungus

7529.84 --> 7535.400000000001
in it is

7532.199 --> 7538.04
dead fungus is essential for like

7535.4 --> 7540.5199999999995
certain type of nutrient transformation

7538.04 --> 7542.599
in the ground that make

7540.52 --> 7546.84
it

7542.599 --> 7546.84
absorbable by the plants it's like

7547.679 --> 7550.679
essential

7552.96 --> 7558.559
takes over some

7555.159 --> 7560.679
animals uh maybe maybe some animals are

7558.559 --> 7566.88
prone to certain type of fungi I know

7560.679 --> 7566.88
that uh reptiles are very sensitive to

7577.599 --> 7580.599
it

7594.04 --> 7599.559
makeup nonsense stories about fungus yes

7597.119 --> 7601.92
absolutely I mean there are some really

7599.559 --> 7605.119000000001
bizarre tropical

7601.92 --> 7607.52
fungi that literally infect insects and

7605.119 --> 7607.5199999999995
then

7607.599 --> 7613.32
like

7609.44 --> 7616.0
become like suicide bombing spreaders of

7613.32 --> 7618.599
of like that fungi thing it's really

7616.0 --> 7622.159
weird but I mean that

7618.599 --> 7622.159000000001
stuff works

7623.04 --> 7629.36
there yeah the zomi ants thing

7626.159 --> 7631.598999999999
right so yeah fungi there's some weird

7629.36 --> 7633.839999999999
ass fungi out there but I

7631.599 --> 7636.119000000001

zombie ANS on a basketball

7727.4 --> 7730.4
what

7739.079 --> 7742.719
you're too tiny to see the

7749.48 --> 7755.718999999999
curve on any second yeah well how about

7752.4 --> 7757.44
you just don't bring that up duper how

7755.719 --> 7760.32
about that how about you don't bring

7757.44 --> 7760.32
that up

7763.0 --> 7768.0
I mean do we have any understanding here

7765.48 --> 7770.638999999999
in this chat about what what's supposed

7768.0 --> 7774.96
to be what we're talking

7770.639 --> 7774.96
about or did you all just

7787.32 --> 7790.32
forget

7799.44 --> 7802.199
the nature of

7803.599 --> 7806.599
Earth

7815.8 --> 7821.639
what can I prove with only one angle

7819.119 --> 7821.639
that it's a

7822.96 --> 7829.559
triangle the what I don't know that's

7826.599 --> 7829.559
not my cup of

7838.239 --> 7845.199
tea That's the topic we are yeah well I

7842.4 --> 7846.839999999999
mean at the flatter of debates perhaps I

7845.199 --> 7848.32
mean we can talk about other things we

7846.84 --> 7850.079
have been talking about other things

7848.32 --> 7854.119
it's just

7850.079 --> 7857.44
that don't start talking about drugs

7854.119 --> 7860.719
okay don't this is 12E

7857.44 --> 7863.079
Plus show I don't want anybody to talk

7860.719 --> 7863.079
about

7864.32 --> 7869.04
that except on how to stay away from

7871.199 --> 7876.759999999999
it yes you can do all with an

7874.559 --> 7879.4400000000005
angle okay I

7876.76 --> 7882.079000000001
know well you can do many things with an

7879.44 --> 7882.079
angle for

7907.159 --> 7910.159
sure

7925.639 --> 7930.119
Dro b d

7933.88 --> 7939.4800000000005
what that D the only freaking thing Dell

7937.119 --> 7941.44
Now talks about is stupid upward Rising

7939.48 --> 7943.0
Earth I mean he's like taken that as his

7941.44 --> 7944.44
Corner thing and that's like the only

7943.0 --> 7948.48
thing he Now talks

7944.44 --> 7948.48
about it's getting really

7948.639 --> 7954.36
tedious not that I'm still subscribed

7951.44 --> 7957.28
and watching it's just that every time I

7954.36 --> 7959.558999999999
know take notice of him it's again about

7957.28 --> 7959.559
that

7967.04 --> 7970.04
nonsense

7996.96 --> 7999.96
for

8006.88 --> 8011.96
in a cul well yeah I guess they are I

8009.92 --> 8015.36
mean that's how they're behaving and

8011.96 --> 8017.96
it's so mon monotonous I

8015.36 --> 8020.679
mean

8017.96 --> 8021.639
just I mean I can't say that I'm really

8020.679 --> 8025.159
happy

8021.639 --> 8029.0
about all of this [ __ ] right we went

8025.159 --> 8031.719
into Flat Earth 2015 with great Great

8029.0 --> 8033.96
Hopes and excitement and it was all

8031.719 --> 8035.639
fresh and all these people were

8033.96 --> 8037.4800000000005
prominent and they were talking about

8035.639 --> 8040.119
like oh yeah we are the flat earthers

8037.48 --> 8043.678999999999
but now like what the

8040.119 --> 8043.679
hell what are they

8047.32 --> 8050.32
doing

8054.599 --> 8059.88
what

8056.88 --> 8059.88
okay

8063.239 --> 8069.718999999999
why why the hell would you be

8065.96 --> 8072.36
crying over being in the in the chat

8069.719 --> 8072.36
there I don't get

8078.159 --> 8083.719
it they're crying about it over

8086.88 --> 8090.679
what

8088.599 --> 8093.559
crying about you being in the chat well

8090.679 --> 8095.4
look Dell's chat's been like a a

8093.559 --> 8099.159000000001
trollfest from the start like he

8095.4 --> 8101.839999999999
literally bans nobody so it's like pure

8099.159 --> 8101.839999999999
crap in

8111.079 --> 8116.44
there so if an outsider then comes in

8114.28 --> 8119.8
and and then just like makes a stand or

8116.44 --> 8119.799999999999
what yeah they're going to go nuts

8123.599 --> 8129.4400000000005
that happens even when I get in there

8125.199 --> 8129.44
and and not be hostile they'll just go

8139.639 --> 8149.8
nuts the anti Fe crowd what does that

8145.239 --> 8149.799999999999
mean oh the anti Fe

8153.679 --> 8159.8
yeah but you got to realize though and

8156.719 --> 8162.0
the anti fed yeah that also but Richard

8159.8 --> 8164.4400000000005
you got to realize that there's like

8162.0 --> 8167.36
these anti flat earther people or and

8164.44 --> 8170.879999999999
the haters are like they're deranged

8167.36 --> 8173.48
people and they always just want to get

8170.88 --> 8176.1990000000005
in your face they want like bacteria

8173.48 --> 8178.5199999999995
like make a permanent residence Like A

8176.199 --> 8181.638999999999
Parasite they just want to drain you

8178.52 --> 8184.2390000000005
nonstop and they want you to accept them

8181.639 --> 8187.079
as your family that you can never get

8184.239 --> 8189.0
rid of that's like how they act I don't

8187.079 --> 8191.92
know if anybody's actually noticed that

8189.0 --> 8192.92
about the deranged people that go around

8191.92 --> 8195.719000000001
in the

8192.92 --> 8198.319
scenery but they literally act like

8195.719 --> 8200.559
family parasites that just like try to

8198.319 --> 8204.0
ingrain themselves in you push all kinds

8200.559 --> 8207.438999999998
of [ __ ] on you and then they

8204.0 --> 8211.2
just they just want that Turf they want

8207.439 --> 8213.08
the right to be doing their nonsense in

8211.2 --> 8216.439
your

8213.08 --> 8220.2
way it's [ __ ] up and I've not

8216.439 --> 8223.639000000001
tolerated and I will never tolerate it

8220.2 --> 8226.92
like I'd rather have a completely Barren

8223.639 --> 8228.92
chat for like 20 minutes on end with

8226.92 --> 8232.319
absolutely nothing happening than

8228.92 --> 8232.319
letting those people in

8236.599 --> 8239.599
there

8249.719 --> 8253.759999999998
yeah yeah but I mean a lot of people

8252.0 --> 8258.319
especially anti Flat Earth they just

8253.76 --> 8258.319
hate Nathan because he's so

8258.399 --> 8264.88
relentless and he has absolutely no

8261.12 --> 8268.479000000001
empathy for for anti flat earthers at

8264.88 --> 8270.839999999998
all like I do sometimes and that's

8268.479 --> 8274.16
logical I got

8270.84 --> 8276.24
Ballwin but like he just doesn't and he

8274.16 --> 8278.8
hates Ballwin he can't stand it because

8276.24 --> 8281.119999999999
it's too real it's too much like the

8278.8 --> 8281.119999999999
real

8286.28 --> 8290.479000000001
thing all right but I mean we're still

8288.92 --> 8294.719000000001
talking about ball I haven't done

8290.479 --> 8294.719
Ballwin in like months

8296.519 --> 8302.679
so

8298.92 --> 8302.679
empathetic person to the core

8302.719 --> 8308.279999999999
yeah it does suck and I don't hang

8306.16 --> 8310.92
around there I mean there's a good

8308.28 --> 8312.559000000001
reason I don't hang around those places

8310.92 --> 8314.88
I don't hang around Dells I don't hang

8312.559 --> 8317.8
around flat sides I don't hang around

8314.88 --> 8320.319
bevs and I don't hang around as much as

8317.8 --> 8321.92
I used to at fed

8320.319 --> 8324.719
even

8321.92 --> 8326.519
cuz yeah these people supposedly the

8324.719 --> 8328.438999999998
flat

8326.519 --> 8331.639000000001
earthers

8328.439 --> 8333.76
dude I don't want to be in that link I

8331.639 --> 8338.24
don't want to be I don't want to be

8333.76 --> 8340.0
associated with all that yeah like

8338.24 --> 8343.0
Nathan's just like oh yeah know it's B

8340.0 --> 8344.719
is just there and FL so it's just there

8343.0 --> 8347.16
and a competing and it's friendly

8344.719 --> 8350.8
competition and like I don't want to

8347.16 --> 8353.679
even be associated with any of

8350.8 --> 8357.279999999999
that like at

8353.679 --> 8361.8
all like I don't want to be associated

8357.28 --> 8361.800000000001
with like provably deranged

8363.679 --> 8370.04
people that just do that that have a

8366.76 --> 8373.84
format of doing things that is provably

8370.04 --> 8377.160000000002
deranged and like with lying in it and

8373.84 --> 8380.479
[ __ ] and Nathan is like really the only

8377.16 --> 8382.439
exception when it comes to that and it's

8380.479 --> 8384.639
still like there's Hassle and there's

8382.439 --> 8387.719000000001
friction and all that [ __ ] and sometimes

8384.639 --> 8390.438999999998
that makes me blow up but at least it's

8387.719 --> 8394.438999999998
not just deranged

8390.439 --> 8397.16
Liars which is like what most of it is

8394.439 --> 8400.28
becoming it's turning into that it's

8397.16 --> 8403.439
like they're turning into the anti flat

8400.28 --> 8406.08
earthers like how they were how those

8403.439 --> 8406.08
were

8416.359 --> 8421.960000000001
before bers come back if you don't

8418.92 --> 8421.960000000001
teabag them

8441.95 --> 8446.960000000001
[Music]

8443.2 --> 8449.68
yeah right I just I just want to talk

8446.96 --> 8454.0
about interesting things

8449.68 --> 8457.439
and and I mean Flat Earth is is going to

8454.0 --> 8460.56
be important at it because there's a lot

8457.439 --> 8463.68
of nonsense [ __ ] that would be made

8460.56 --> 8465.399
up in relation to space cosmology and

8463.68 --> 8467.56
all that and now like with the Flat

8465.399 --> 8469.319
Earth you just know immediately like

8467.56 --> 8471.68
that's made of nonsense that's made of

8469.319 --> 8474.24
nonsense that's made of nonsense makes

8471.68 --> 8477.0
it very

8474.24 --> 8478.84
handy cuz then you don't have to Del in

8477.0 --> 8481.399
the nonsense you could just say it's

8478.84 --> 8482.72
nonsense it's based on heliocentrism

8481.399 --> 8485.72
it's

8482.72 --> 8485.72
nonsense

8501.28 --> 8504.569000000001
[Music]

8506.24 --> 8509.24
obviously

8514.319 --> 8520.6
goof make fun of bad behavior traits

8517.479 --> 8525.399
yeah that's all part of it because bad

8520.6 --> 8530.319
behavior is like damaging to

8525.399 --> 8530.319
empaths it's like an offense it's

8536.16 --> 8539.16
offensive

8560.72 --> 8565.599999999999
right and a lot of people that have bad

8562.6 --> 8568.68
behavioral traits they end up wanting

8565.6 --> 8570.800000000001
power over other people

8568.68 --> 8572.84
when the only real power that you can

8570.8 --> 8574.599999999999
get that is durable is power over

8572.84 --> 8578.72
yourself

8574.6 --> 8581.68
and containing and working on and

8578.72 --> 8584.0
mastering your traits and making sure

8581.68 --> 8586.24
that you

8584.0 --> 8589.28
don't behave

8586.24 --> 8592.399
badly and like keep getting better at it

8589.28 --> 8594.76
take it very serious and then that's the

8592.399 --> 8596.439
real power that you can develop right

8594.76 --> 8598.279
when you try to have power over others

8596.439 --> 8600.68
You' want

8598.279 --> 8602.800000000001
then your demonic sides your flaws will

8600.68 --> 8605.68
be like reigning Supreme and you'll

8602.8 --> 8605.679999999998
leave them like

8606.92 --> 8611.439
it it'll make it visible it's like a

8609.479 --> 8613.119999999999
virtue s like I have power here because

8611.439 --> 8615.84
I can be degenerated nobody's going to

8613.12 --> 8618.319000000001
do anything about it yeah well guess

8615.84 --> 8622.12
what that doesn't

8618.319 --> 8626.08
last and when it ends you have literally

8622.12 --> 8629.319000000001
nothing nothing but a void of what is no

8626.08 --> 8631.319
longer well if you just don't do that at

8629.319 --> 8633.0
all and you actually face your problems

8631.319 --> 8635.119999999999
and the issues that they have and you

8633.0 --> 8638.88
are honest about like what your

8635.12 --> 8642.479000000001
capabilities are and like how the world

8638.88 --> 8645.319
is in general like irrational about

8642.479 --> 8646.92
these things and about sizing people up

8645.319 --> 8649.24
typically and

8646.92 --> 8652.0
expectations like the expectations that

8649.24 --> 8653.16
humans have of other humans and

8652.0 --> 8658.96
themselves

8653.16 --> 8663.56
are very irrational at this point

8658.96 --> 8667.519999999999
like the expectations they have is just

8663.56 --> 8667.519999999999
nonsense and that's where you need to

8668.24 --> 8674.0
start like just be a human being realize

8671.76 --> 8676.04
if you have problems why why do you have

8674.0 --> 8679.319
problems and then

8676.04 --> 8681.880000000001
like just deal with it like actually

8679.319 --> 8684.519999999999
face it don't try to escape it don't try

8681.88 --> 8687.88
to deny don't do drugs that try to not

8684.52 --> 8690.2
know that you have issues

8687.88 --> 8691.759999999998
face it deal with it and then just like

8690.2 --> 8695.84
work on

8691.76 --> 8698.399
it and you will be better with it and it

8695.84 --> 8701.6
might even like completely overcome the

8698.399 --> 8704.08
flaws that you have then you actually

8701.6 --> 8707.04
have something out of

8704.08 --> 8710.16
it on the long run like you'll be a more

8707.04 --> 8715.04
fixed person instead of just a burden on

8710.16 --> 8715.039999999999
everybody like always like so many of

8715.88 --> 8718.88
them

8719.8 --> 8724.24
yeah a benefit to Society at least try

8721.96 --> 8727.8
it you know like I am not a financial

8724.24 --> 8729.56
benefit to society I'm sorry but I'm

8727.8 --> 8733.759999999998
going to try to make it

8729.56 --> 8733.76
up with everything else that I

8733.8 --> 8741.119999999999
do like good like yeah good

8738.359 --> 8743.800000000001
morality showing learning curve always

8741.12 --> 8745.640000000001
motivating to keep fighting keep

8743.8 --> 8748.399
learning against the darkness in

8745.64 --> 8751.358999999999
ourselves and everywhere

8748.399 --> 8751.358999999999
like you have to keep

8753.399 --> 8760.278999999999
going to emphasize I guess the personal

8757.359 --> 8763.439
struggle that people have and that you

8760.279 --> 8766.52
must engage with you must do that

8763.439 --> 8768.64
especially if you're a man or it'll be

8766.52 --> 8772.960000000001
really unhealthy for you because you're

8768.64 --> 8776.56
if you don't tackle the battle on the

8772.96 --> 8778.839999999998
inside then the battle's going to tackle

8776.56 --> 8782.278999999999
people people on the

8778.84 --> 8785.2
outside you're going to burden

8782.279 --> 8787.2
others they're not they won't be able to

8785.2 --> 8790.399000000001
be completely honest with you anymore

8787.2 --> 8794.439
because you're unreliable etc etc

8790.399 --> 8796.92
right so do something about it I am I'm

8794.439 --> 8799.720000000001
doing my entire life is like dedicated

8796.92 --> 8804.12
to that yeah cuz if you think that I'm

8799.72 --> 8808.8
kind of unstable now dude you you like

8804.12 --> 8808.800000000001
20 years ago that that's like

8809.12 --> 8816.279
it was way worse in ways it was just

8813.2 --> 8819.880000000001
completely hidden I was hiding it I was

8816.279 --> 8821.359
in denial like I am I have parts of me

8819.88 --> 8823.479
that feel like I'm

8821.359 --> 8826.08
broken it's like the

8823.479 --> 8828.479
sensitivity it gets During certain

8826.08 --> 8831.96
phases it's like too much I get overload

8828.479 --> 8835.039999999999
I was in denial about that being real

8831.96 --> 8837.72
because I couldn't admit it to the world

8835.04 --> 8840.479000000001
that I had that because I couldn't see

8837.72 --> 8842.519999999999
myself as like being broken but I did

8840.479 --> 8844.72
realize like oh there's actually a lot

8842.52 --> 8847.92
of people that have issues like that and

8844.72 --> 8851.438999999998
they oh keep it a secret I'll keep it a

8847.92 --> 8854.479
secret because you can't be caught with

8851.439 --> 8857.24
your weakness like that because people

8854.479 --> 8859.119999999999
will start to talk down to you or regard

8857.24 --> 8861.6
you like a [ __ ] or something those

8859.12 --> 8863.720000000001
types of things right so I'd always had

8861.6 --> 8866.399000000001
to hide

8863.72 --> 8867.84
it and it didn't work out so I'm like

8866.399 --> 8871.519999999999
good sometimes I couldn't hide and it

8867.84 --> 8874.08
just broken in public very

8871.52 --> 8877.0
humiliating but I'd survive

8874.08 --> 8882.12
it but

8877.0 --> 8884.399
now I'm not afraid to have that really

8882.12 --> 8887.800000000001
to be honest about it like yeah I do

8884.399 --> 8890.039999999999
have issues but I'm always working on it

8887.8 --> 8892.438999999998
like if you want to know you want to be

8890.04 --> 8895.0
informed about my state I'm the guy to

8892.439 --> 8898.439
go to you can ask me about what my state

8895.0 --> 8900.84
is and I'll be able to explain it in

8898.439 --> 8904.04
detail like where am I what's going on

8900.84 --> 8906.960000000001
right now how is my inner workings is it

8904.04 --> 8909.12
stable what yeah I mean it's like a

8906.96 --> 8911.16
profession of mine I'm like a

8909.12 --> 8914.359
professional

8911.16 --> 8919.88
psycher and I am the number one

8914.359 --> 8919.880000000001
patient and it's been like that for 30

8920.399 --> 8924.439
years pretty much 30

8925.6 --> 8931.880000000001
years

8927.88 --> 8934.96
and at first I was just like not really

8931.88 --> 8937.599999999999
all that good in knowing how to do

8934.96 --> 8939.96
things and now I'm just so much more

8937.6 --> 8943.960000000001
cleared up as to what was real and what

8939.96 --> 8949.039999999999
isn't that I'm just doing a way better

8943.96 --> 8952.64
job and I'm hoping that like by

8949.04 --> 8955.880000000001
publicly doing that it will get some

8952.64 --> 8958.92
other people motivated to also do that

8955.88 --> 8961.88
and doesn't mean oh you have to now go

8958.92 --> 8963.88
public with your weakest sides all the

8961.88 --> 8965.64
time and then dude you're going to get

8963.88 --> 8967.64
trolled to all hell okay I'm getting

8965.64 --> 8970.8
trolled to all hell I'm specifically

8967.64 --> 8972.88
doing it so you don't have to not saying

8970.8 --> 8974.72
that you should like absolutely

8972.88 --> 8976.119999999999
shouldn't do it if if you think you can

8974.72 --> 8978.519999999999
get something out of it I'm just saying

8976.12 --> 8982.08
like it's probably not worth it but it

8978.52 --> 8985.0
was worth for me to be able to have

8982.08 --> 8987.56
other people just like

8985.0 --> 8990.16
accept that you might have these flaws

8987.56 --> 8993.76
and that you have to work on

8990.16 --> 8995.76
it especially younger kids CU When

8993.76 --> 8999.0
you're really young and you discover you

8995.76 --> 9001.24
have like a thing a mental weird thing

8999.0 --> 9004.64
that's like really scary to you it was

9001.24 --> 9006.72
really scary to me too because you don't

9004.64 --> 9009.039999999999
want to see yourself as

9006.72 --> 9011.92
broken you want to see yourself as

9009.04 --> 9013.800000000001
always whole and strong and and it's

9011.92 --> 9016.88
like a nightmare to think about it it

9013.8 --> 9018.438999999998
might be physically like a nightmare too

9016.88 --> 9020.199999999999
when you have it and then you're going

9018.439 --> 9023.880000000001
to just deny

9020.2 --> 9026.960000000001
it but I've

9023.88 --> 9028.72
learned just by sheer exposure and never

9026.96 --> 9032.479
taking

9028.72 --> 9034.56
medication that you can actively use the

9032.479 --> 9038.199999999999
the terrible

9034.56 --> 9042.199999999999
states to

9038.2 --> 9045.08
still like manage yourself

9042.2 --> 9048.359
properly like even when I'm

9045.08 --> 9051.8
panicking I still have routines that I

9048.359 --> 9054.68
do in order to not make it worse not

9051.8 --> 9058.438999999998
give me a heart attack not go completely

9054.68 --> 9061.56
apeshit there's all these things all the

9058.439 --> 9063.68
tricks and how to deal with like every

9061.56 --> 9066.8
state every type of broken state that

9063.68 --> 9068.880000000001
you could arrive at so that you never

9066.8 --> 9070.72
have to feel like oh my God I don't know

9068.88 --> 9073.839999999998
what's going to happen

9070.72 --> 9075.519999999999
now you always know like no no matter

9073.84 --> 9078.880000000001
what happens to me there's always things

9075.52 --> 9078.880000000001
that I can do in every

9079.8 --> 9084.679999999998
state and even know like when your mind

9082.88 --> 9087.16
is just going nuts and telling you

9084.68 --> 9089.800000000001
things that are like wrong that you know

9087.16 --> 9094.279
how to identify that for yourself that

9089.8 --> 9094.278999999999
it's wrong and what do you do with it

9094.92 --> 9099.399
then and these are all like

9096.96 --> 9101.8
psychological

9099.399 --> 9104.24
puzzles and yeah I don't know maybe I'm

9101.8 --> 9109.278999999999
reminding you of these things maybe

9104.24 --> 9111.039999999999
not but yeah I just I just think that a

9109.279 --> 9113.68
lot of people in this world are like

9111.04 --> 9117.279
psychologically burdened

9113.68 --> 9120.359
and if the world wasn't so incredibly

9117.279 --> 9124.04
hostile and weaponized

9120.359 --> 9126.04
psychologically then they would all have

9124.04 --> 9128.84
less issues they would do better they

9126.04 --> 9132.76
would be way more stable so it's like

9128.84 --> 9136.08
the psychological war is making people's

9132.76 --> 9139.479
weakness come forth and burden them more

9136.08 --> 9143.279
and making their lives collapse

9139.479 --> 9147.0
potentially I am doing a public study to

9143.279 --> 9150.439
try to help everyone basically to face

9147.0 --> 9153.64
this to remain strong to keep holding

9150.439 --> 9155.24
on like even when superficial rousing

9153.64 --> 9158.119999999999
speeches don't

9155.24 --> 9160.439
work yeah cuz sometimes it doesn't work

9158.12 --> 9163.08
sometimes you're just broken and then

9160.439 --> 9165.56
any kind of speech or like rowdiness is

9163.08 --> 9168.56
like oh I can't hand this too much like

9165.56 --> 9171.319
and then what yeah then all that the

9168.56 --> 9174.199999999999
standard railroad you're going with the

9171.319 --> 9176.68
standard ride you're going with suddenly

9174.2 --> 9179.479000000001
doesn't work and then what do you do

9176.68 --> 9181.279
right it's very difficult can be very

9179.479 --> 9183.16
scary

9181.279 --> 9186.24
even

9183.16 --> 9189.439
so you got to learn to deal with all of

9186.24 --> 9191.359
it I had to and I still have to it's

9189.439 --> 9194.279
like becoming the pressure is more

9191.359 --> 9196.76
strong than it was 10 years ago from the

9194.279 --> 9200.68
outside I'm having more difficult on

9196.76 --> 9203.319
average with with it that's why it

9200.68 --> 9206.399
happens kind of

9203.319 --> 9208.88
periodically but I'm very active and

9206.399 --> 9211.68
very bravely if I say so myself dealing

9208.88 --> 9214.679999999998
with it this is like my mission it's my

9211.68 --> 9216.6
life mission is now to survive through

9214.68 --> 9221.720000000001
this and to do it optimally and to

9216.6 --> 9228.16
report out with honesty and help

9221.72 --> 9228.16
people realize that you can make it

9232.6 --> 9239.68
although yeah I I don't have really a

9235.16 --> 9239.68
lot of advice for like vaccinated

9239.72 --> 9247.08
people but if you just had issues you're

9243.96 --> 9250.96
born in it it's in the family perhaps

9247.08 --> 9253.56
like there's other ways of dealing with

9250.96 --> 9255.119999999999
it and sometimes it's like oh you could

9253.56 --> 9257.439
just drug yourself out of your mind and

9255.12 --> 9260.6
then just h just go through the time

9257.439 --> 9263.68
until it's gone or you actually face the

9260.6 --> 9266.6
challenge which is actually painful like

9263.68 --> 9269.04
it is like scary and painful very

9266.6 --> 9273.359
privately scary and

9269.04 --> 9278.279
painful but if you face that like the

9273.359 --> 9281.84
reward like the from God is

9278.279 --> 9285.08
significant it is there is a reward from

9281.84 --> 9288.08
God if you dare to face

9285.08 --> 9288.08
it

9288.279 --> 9293.16
but it's

9290.359 --> 9297.92
scary and the more you escape and get

9293.16 --> 9301.56
used to escaping from it the scarier it

9297.92 --> 9303.64
gets this why some people they very

9301.56 --> 9305.0
early on learn when they when they

9303.64 --> 9306.16
figure it out they just face it

9305.0 --> 9308.0
immediately and they accept it

9306.16 --> 9310.359
immediately and then they don't have a

9308.0 --> 9312.64
problem it doesn't develop into a

9310.359 --> 9314.16
problem then for them they just deal

9312.64 --> 9317.199999999999
with it

9314.16 --> 9319.2
instantaneously see

9317.2 --> 9322.16
if you're used to

9319.2 --> 9325.720000000001
escaping when a problem arises then

9322.16 --> 9328.119999999999
it'll get worse and the fear of it will

9325.72 --> 9328.119999999999
become

9329.56 --> 9337.319
worse right this is also by the

9332.6 --> 9342.399000000001
way similar issues as to what alcoholism

9337.319 --> 9344.039999999999
is Right alcoholics escape with alcohol

9342.399 --> 9346.358999999999
they become different and they not

9344.04 --> 9348.84
reminded they don't feel anything about

9346.359 --> 9351.359
the typical things the subtle

9348.84 --> 9354.399
things and that's why they do it it's

9351.359 --> 9354.399000000001
the escapism

9354.76 --> 9361.439
really and then it becomes difficult you

9358.8 --> 9364.119999999999
can't face it anymore

9361.439 --> 9366.880000000001
eventually with some people they just

9364.12 --> 9369.399000000001
can't face it you'll like have to almost

9366.88 --> 9371.8
torture them to get through to them at

9369.399 --> 9374.599999999999
that point and that's not legal right I

9371.8 --> 9374.599999999999
mean it's not going to

9374.92 --> 9380.08
happen

9376.64 --> 9382.479
only the person themselves can really

9380.08 --> 9384.8
decide that they're going to take on the

9382.479 --> 9386.519999999999
battle and by the time you're like an

9384.8 --> 9388.8
alcoholic and you're like you've done

9386.52 --> 9392.08
that for 10 years or 20 years yeah now

9388.8 --> 9394.319
it's really really difficult well in the

9392.08 --> 9397.8
beginning it might have been very scary

9394.319 --> 9400.92
very painful but it would have

9397.8 --> 9403.64
worked and you would have developed more

9400.92 --> 9406.319
out of it if you done it

9403.64 --> 9409.119999999999
earlier it's just more difficult at the

9406.319 --> 9413.319
end but if you don't do it it's hell

9409.12 --> 9417.04
like the more you don't do it the more

9413.319 --> 9417.039999999999
hell is where you end

9417.56 --> 9425.76
up in reality you don't really get a

9422.279 --> 9428.84
choice I do see it like it is like this

9425.76 --> 9432.24
esoteric God situation it's like yeah

9428.84 --> 9436.479
all sin leads to death if you sin

9432.24 --> 9438.76
against yourself it's going to kill you

9436.479 --> 9442.0
if you don't stop if you don't

9438.76 --> 9442.0
face the

9444.64 --> 9451.08
pain and deal with

9447.399 --> 9455.72
it like yeah nobody told nobody said

9451.08 --> 9455.72
that God makes people's lives

9455.8 --> 9460.039999999999
easy there's a lot of challenges every

9458.52 --> 9463.399000000001
person is born

9460.04 --> 9465.2
with and you got to realize that what

9463.399 --> 9467.68
you get to see from other people is that

9465.2 --> 9470.12
most of them just they don't show how

9467.68 --> 9471.399
difficult it is what they deal with

9470.12 --> 9472.720000000001
because they don't want to burden with

9471.399 --> 9475.519999999999
others and they don't want rumors to

9472.72 --> 9479.0
spread around but it does

9475.52 --> 9481.399000000001
happen everybody has their really heavy

9479.0 --> 9483.439
challenges and some people just can't

9481.399 --> 9485.319
really handle it too much and then it

9483.439 --> 9487.76
and it really starts to

9485.319 --> 9489.76
show to others and then they become

9487.76 --> 9492.16
known as like that's a troubled guy or

9489.76 --> 9495.439
girl

9492.16 --> 9499.0
whatever but everybody in One Way or

9495.439 --> 9502.24
Another has difficult struggles internal

9499.0 --> 9504.479
to deal with it's a part of the design

9502.24 --> 9507.439
it's a part of the spiritual Quest and

9504.479 --> 9507.438999999998
yeah exactly it's a

9507.64 --> 9514.72
journey and it is like that's the Miss

9511.24 --> 9516.359
that's the mission from God like deal

9514.72 --> 9520.24
with those

9516.359 --> 9524.279
things if you do that

9520.24 --> 9526.439
like the reward from God will be more

9524.279 --> 9530.479000000001
than you can imagine

9526.439 --> 9533.76
because you'll literally become

9530.479 --> 9536.0
different you'll become more than you

9533.76 --> 9540.439
expected or that you thought you could

9536.0 --> 9543.64
be but that really only really happens

9540.439 --> 9547.24
when you face those

9543.64 --> 9547.24
issues that's how it

9549.0 --> 9553.92
works right and if you don't face those

9551.439 --> 9557.04
issues you better damn well be

9553.92 --> 9559.88
working on like building yourself and

9557.04 --> 9563.319000000001
restructuring yourself Just So

9559.88 --> 9564.88
eventually you can face yourself and

9563.319 --> 9568.88
that is what I have

9564.88 --> 9570.759999999998
done I've had massive escapism issues

9568.88 --> 9572.88
like where I could never focus on what I

9570.76 --> 9574.72
had to do I would always get inspiration

9572.88 --> 9579.039999999999
about other things and then I would do

9574.72 --> 9582.358999999999
that but in developing that I eventually

9579.04 --> 9584.080000000002
figured that out about myself and

9582.359 --> 9587.2
then

9584.08 --> 9589.88
stopped trying to to escape and like

9587.2 --> 9592.399000000001
enjoy the fruits of that escapism the

9589.88 --> 9596.438999999998
int through the intelligence that I had

9592.399 --> 9598.92
and instead like okay now I know how

9596.439 --> 9602.479000000001
escapism works I know how to recognize

9598.92 --> 9606.319
it and I know how to

9602.479 --> 9608.599999999999
like use the impulse of it because it's

9606.319 --> 9610.08
it's grind in it's it's built into me

9608.6 --> 9612.880000000001
now it's because I've done it so many

9610.08 --> 9616.24
times there's a side escape and now I

9612.88 --> 9619.8
can use that to cut it off but still use

9616.24 --> 9622.319
it for inspiration in the moment and so

9619.8 --> 9624.319
I've just figured out mentally if you're

9622.319 --> 9626.72
Dynamic enough and if you brave enough

9624.319 --> 9628.96
to to develop yourself like that and

9626.72 --> 9633.039999999999
hopefully have a bit of talent for it

9628.96 --> 9636.278999999999
you can literally turn any flaw or any

9633.04 --> 9639.880000000001
error that's any mistake any damage even

9636.279 --> 9643.52
you had you can turn it

9639.88 --> 9646.56
unexpectedly into a good thing finding

9643.52 --> 9649.16
the way through TR finding the way

9646.56 --> 9651.08
through not just oh accepting it's lost

9649.16 --> 9655.0
accepting your

9651.08 --> 9660.72
no the way you dealt with it or how it

9655.0 --> 9663.84
is can be used you just have to believe

9660.72 --> 9667.88
in it and work towards it and then it's

9663.84 --> 9671.319
like you bend the loss

9667.88 --> 9671.319
into something

9672.08 --> 9677.439
constructive and I'm obsessed with that

9674.479 --> 9677.438999999998
mechanism

9677.72 --> 9686.479
because it's given me so incredibly

9682.04 --> 9686.479000000001
much so that's what I'm talking about a

9686.56 --> 9692.8
lot that's like how I do things is what

9689.439 --> 9692.800000000001
I'm paying attention

9695.08 --> 9702.52
to like I want people to face and

9698.96 --> 9707.438999999998
overcome their flaws and master them and

9702.52 --> 9707.439
be Masters alongside me

9708.56 --> 9715.278999999999
and I feel that yeah most of you in my

9711.84 --> 9715.279
chat do actually try

9715.68 --> 9721.439
that you're at least

9718.399 --> 9723.278999999999
trying and some of you are arguably very

9721.439 --> 9726.2
far at it you might have been

9723.279 --> 9729.560000000001
specifically looking for a guy like me

9726.2 --> 9729.560000000001
that would do that like

9732.2 --> 9736.0
you and it would have been like finally

9734.84 --> 9738.16
a guy

9736.0 --> 9739.84
a guy that's exactly trying to

9738.16 --> 9742.92
accomplish what I

9739.84 --> 9747.08
do in that

9742.92 --> 9750.92
way I do feel like that camaraderie with

9747.08 --> 9757.439
a lot of you guys like you really get

9750.92 --> 9757.439
it this old Benjamin show so great

9758.279 --> 9762.960000000001
uh what does it make that is just

9764.359 --> 9767.359
hilarious

9770.08 --> 9775.479
and that he's always

9771.68 --> 9778.68
like doing going against the the

9775.479 --> 9781.92
politically correct grain but not in

9778.68 --> 9785.880000000001
like a standard lame way but like

9781.92 --> 9785.88
actually really doing it

9786.08 --> 9794.12
like right you have like this counter aw

9789.96 --> 9795.839999999998
the right it's like oh look at the Ws

9794.12 --> 9798.160000000002
they're so stupid right

9795.84 --> 9800.64
well Owen Benjamin then goes to a

9798.16 --> 9802.8
territory specifically saying things

9800.64 --> 9806.278999999999
that would offend those people that

9802.8 --> 9809.84
would go like well we don't like PR PC

9806.279 --> 9813.399000000001
but Owen Benjamin goes way too far like

9809.84 --> 9815.56
that's exactly what is what he's that's

9813.399 --> 9818.119999999999
what he wants to do is supposed to be

9815.56 --> 9820.6
that that's the real thing that he

9818.12 --> 9823.08
triggers those that supposedly go

9820.6 --> 9827.24
against sjws and all

9823.08 --> 9831.479
that and

9827.24 --> 9831.479
just reveals everything about

9832.92 --> 9838.319
it like reveal how a lot of like those

9835.8 --> 9841.039999999999
conservatives out there that are

9838.319 --> 9845.439
supposedly conservatives are like really

9841.04 --> 9845.439
really gay which is

9846.12 --> 9849.880000000001
ridiculous that kind of thing so yeah

9848.76 --> 9853.2
that's

9849.88 --> 9857.199999999999
just like it or not that's what he does

9853.2 --> 9857.2
he has oh yes he has balls

9865.439 --> 9868.800000000001
absolutely all right anyway I'm going to

9867.399 --> 9873.08
take a two-minute break I'll be right

9868.8 --> 9873.08
back oh Sky got all clear it

9884.16 --> 9887.16
up

9944.08 --> 9947.08
e

9975.16 --> 9978.72
I'm back all

9979.96 --> 9989.08
right I'm going to put it in the

9982.8 --> 9989.08
title stupid black goo [ __ ] it's really

9989.32 --> 9992.44
[Music]

10004.0 --> 10007.0
insignificant

10010.44 --> 10014.839

[Applause]

10020.49 --> 10023.628999999999

[Music]

10046.03 --> 10057.84
[Music]

10055.16 --> 10060.2
okay yeah good say goodbye to the black

10057.84 --> 10062.2
goo because that's gone now now it's the

10060.2 --> 10066.92
title is face your inner problems and

10062.2 --> 10066.92
gain God's reward start early in life

10093.8 --> 10096.8
life

10107.76 --> 10113.960000000001
yeah you're not part of a church triple

10109.88 --> 10116.679999999998
XX yeah neither am I solitary eclectic

10113.96 --> 10120.24
is what I am I mean I'm very eclectic

10116.68 --> 10122.399
and I'm very Germanic you could say I'm

10120.24 --> 10123.8
I'm very much sticking to the rudol

10122.399 --> 10126.92
Steiner

10123.8 --> 10129.08
systems and I don't know maybe a whole

10126.92 --> 10135.16
bunch of people like how dare you but he

10129.08 --> 10138.319
was this or that and it's like I don't

10135.16 --> 10140.359
care this is what I do this is what I

10138.319 --> 10143.359
will remain

10140.359 --> 10143.359
doing

10143.72 --> 10150.278999999999
yeah I don't trust the church

10146.84 --> 10150.279
organizations any of

10151.96 --> 10157.599999999999
them they're all full of propaga and

10155.319 --> 10159.439
they don't even realize it like if

10157.6 --> 10163.279
you're a church and you're like

10159.439 --> 10165.800000000001
completely drenched in state

10163.279 --> 10168.960000000001
propaganda like how is that a place a

10165.8 --> 10172.519999999999
God I'm

10168.96 --> 10172.519999999999
sorry like this

10179.64 --> 10184.8
unacceptable like that's abs like you

10182.439 --> 10187.68
shouldn't necessarily be up in

10184.8 --> 10190.199999999999
opposition or anything but like you

10187.68 --> 10192.2
should have the right to like no I'm not

10190.2 --> 10194.720000000001
going to we're not going to talk about

10192.2 --> 10197.52
the current thing and I recommend you

10194.72 --> 10203.399
completely stay out of

10197.52 --> 10204.720000000001
it like that's much more logical really

10203.399 --> 10207.96
for a

10204.72 --> 10211.119999999999
church but they all go with the current

10207.96 --> 10214.88
things like all churches that are just

10211.12 --> 10216.359
have gone been sweeped up by current

10214.88 --> 10219.358999999999
thing

10216.359 --> 10222.04
politics and so their roots are gone

10219.359 --> 10224.04
they're now just puppet Organization for

10222.04 --> 10226.04
the government that way like they're

10224.04 --> 10228.76
doing it for the

10226.04 --> 10230.68
government so that's not a Church of God

10228.76 --> 10232.68
anymore it's a church for the government

10230.68 --> 10234.479000000001
it's rolling out propaganda from the

10232.68 --> 10239.08
government

10234.479 --> 10243.64
then not a church then not of

10239.08 --> 10246.0
God that's how I see it like I literally

10243.64 --> 10248.88
like with the church

10246.0 --> 10251.76
here

10248.88 --> 10255.039999999999
right when they did all that I was

10251.76 --> 10258.399
literally like you're literally cursing

10255.04 --> 10260.399000000001
yourself you're literally like chipping

10258.399 --> 10263.76
away at the blessings that you all

10260.399 --> 10267.278999999999
enjoyed together by engaging with this

10263.76 --> 10270.359
you're cursing yourselves really badly

10267.279 --> 10274.0
and they just they just

10270.359 --> 10276.52
like I don't know they just don't know

10274.0 --> 10278.84
what to do with at

10276.52 --> 10281.68
all and they just all went with it and

10278.84 --> 10285.04
like I can't be part of

10281.68 --> 10285.04
that like at

10298.08 --> 10303.56
all Christ wrote exactly zero words down

10301.72 --> 10305.84
so

10303.56 --> 10309.479
what

10305.84 --> 10312.439
he dictated or he he just like his

10309.479 --> 10312.438999999998
disciples wrote it

10312.8 --> 10319.519999999999
down I've not written down much either I

10316.359 --> 10322.800000000001
mean I'm saying things

10319.52 --> 10325.560000000001
here I haven't written like a book or

10322.8 --> 10326.8
anything like I don't even know how to

10325.56 --> 10329.64
do that

10326.8 --> 10332.72
now

10329.64 --> 10335.16
because just the way my knowledge Works

10332.72 --> 10337.96
a book doesn't work

10335.16 --> 10340.2
it just doesn't work it's like i' write

10337.96 --> 10342.759999999998
it down and then just have like a

10340.2 --> 10344.960000000001
million things that are like this is

10342.76 --> 10346.880000000001
infinitely wrong every [ __ ] thing

10344.96 --> 10349.0
here is infinitely wrong because just

10346.88 --> 10353.319
this and then it's different and I can't

10349.0 --> 10359.319
change it because it's now written down

10353.319 --> 10361.84
like the way I work is very dynamic in a

10359.319 --> 10365.278999999999
hyperdimensional way arguably if you

10361.84 --> 10367.04
write it down that doesn't work

10365.279 --> 10369.720000000001
it's like as soon as you wrote it down

10367.04 --> 10371.960000000001
it immediately became outdated that's

10369.72 --> 10371.96
the

10379.0 --> 10387.0
effect when is paying for God good uh

10384.2 --> 10388.439
well it's not about that it's about

10387.0 --> 10392.96
supporting

10388.439 --> 10396.359
for a community yeah Community Support

10392.96 --> 10396.358999999999
is good

10398.04 --> 10402.76
so yeah I

10399.76 --> 10404.479
mean the church asking for money I I

10402.76 --> 10406.16
have nothing against that it's it's

10404.479 --> 10408.278999999999
communities you're doing it for the

10406.16 --> 10411.84
community

10408.279 --> 10414.04
right some do it for status well that

10411.84 --> 10418.72
all depends on the

10414.04 --> 10422.2
community One Church does that others

10418.72 --> 10424.039999999999
don't but I mean the Devils just roam

10422.2 --> 10426.319000000001
around in people's heads and they will

10424.04 --> 10428.800000000001
make it about status even if the church

10426.319 --> 10431.119999999999
itself doesn't cuz that's just the way

10428.8 --> 10431.119999999999
people

10432.92 --> 10438.6
are

10435.0 --> 10441.72
typically maybe not Mormons they're very

10438.6 --> 10441.720000000001
docile like

10442.56 --> 10448.239
that they don't pick on one another at

10445.68 --> 10451.16
all which I really liked about them

10448.239 --> 10453.479
that's what I like so much but yeah they

10451.16 --> 10457.16
do just get sweeped up in the current

10453.479 --> 10457.16
thing like complete dumb

10460.52 --> 10467.76
asses and that just again reminds me of

10463.56 --> 10467.76
like yeah my people perish for a lack of

10468.08 --> 10474.2
knowledge that's what they are

10470.359 --> 10474.2
potentially facing in these

10477.56 --> 10486.278999999999
times what Psalm 22 what are you talking

10483.279 --> 10486.279
about

10506.04 --> 10510.960000000001
a cartoon asking for money yeah that is

10508.359 --> 10510.960000000001
weird

10513.2 --> 10516.2
what

10525.8 --> 10531.64
is he any good at

10528.68 --> 10535.2
anything so I find it quite disturbing

10531.64 --> 10537.92
to just Spirit Science and New Age like

10535.2 --> 10537.92
together is

10543.2 --> 10546.2
like

10571.08 --> 10575.279
all right but anyway to get back to the

10573.08 --> 10578.6
title right

10575.279 --> 10580.76
it's a it's a matter of looking like you

10578.6 --> 10584.0
got to realize like this a lot of this

10580.76 --> 10587.0
is like issues with God that people have

10584.0 --> 10589.56
in creation right and it's like why did

10587.0 --> 10592.399
go God do this to me why did he give me

10589.56 --> 10594.278999999999
this law and then they think God is evil

10592.399 --> 10596.199999999999
they just and then they try to reject

10594.279 --> 10600.52
him because they don't want

10596.2 --> 10603.16
to believe that how they see it in that

10600.52 --> 10604.960000000001
moment how they regard it is real and so

10603.16 --> 10607.319
then they start deny denying God because

10604.96 --> 10610.519999999999
it can't be real you know what actually

10607.319 --> 10613.56
happens with that is that they just

10610.52 --> 10617.359
don't see what it really is they don't

10613.56 --> 10620.0
see that a flaw isn't really a

10617.359 --> 10623.52
flaw but a

10620.0 --> 10625.76
challenge and that it is

10623.52 --> 10627.52
rewarded if you don't see that part then

10625.76 --> 10631.6
you could just roll into becoming an

10627.52 --> 10634.76
atheist and like ruining your

10631.6 --> 10636.84
life and that's why when you're facing

10634.76 --> 10641.84
that kind of thing when you're young you

10636.84 --> 10644.439
need a wise Elder person that will tell

10641.84 --> 10647.319
you will explain you in those difficult

10644.439 --> 10649.359
moments about how it really is about a

10647.319 --> 10651.199999999999
challenge of God that it's like that's a

10649.359 --> 10654.439
life that's like a war you're going to

10651.2 --> 10658.2
fight the rest of your life but if you

10654.439 --> 10660.479000000001
take the challenge if you embrace it the

10658.2 --> 10663.0
reward will

10660.479 --> 10664.92
outdo the

10663.0 --> 10668.8
flaw

10664.92 --> 10668.8
accept it be with God accept

10669.439 --> 10677.08
it or rejected and be truly

10674.04 --> 10681.080000000002
flawed yeah if you reject the challenge

10677.08 --> 10683.039999999999
then you are that flaw you gave up God

10681.08 --> 10685.399
because of that flaw you gave up your

10683.04 --> 10687.720000000001
connection because of the flaw and you

10685.399 --> 10690.08
didn't accept the challenge that God

10687.72 --> 10690.08
gave

10690.76 --> 10697.52
you when God never gives you any

10694.04 --> 10700.68
challenge without a reward that

10697.52 --> 10704.359
surpasses the

10700.68 --> 10706.720000000001
challenge it just you have to actually

10704.359 --> 10709.68
take the challenge to be able to

10706.72 --> 10711.64
eventually see that if you don't take it

10709.68 --> 10714.68
then you don't get to see the reward you

10711.64 --> 10717.239
won't even believe it's

10714.68 --> 10719.08
there you'll just think of it oh this is

10717.239 --> 10722.239
just another person trying to convince

10719.08 --> 10724.279
me God exists again which is like don't

10722.239 --> 10726.76
look at it don't reconsider it don't

10724.279 --> 10726.76
think about

10726.92 --> 10732.64
it get there quick yeah when your

10729.76 --> 10734.92
teenager suddenly like shows that they

10732.64 --> 10738.119999999999
like have real

10734.92 --> 10740.16
anxiety tell them this tell them about

10738.12 --> 10741.68
the Challenge from God and that the

10740.16 --> 10744.88
reward

10741.68 --> 10744.880000000001
outweighs the

10747.319 --> 10752.84
flaw it's like God doesn't take things

10750.439 --> 10755.76
away from you without giving you more

10752.84 --> 10758.8
back but you have to take the challenge

10755.76 --> 10758.800000000001
or you won't get

10759.2 --> 10766.279
it and then you will

10763.12 --> 10769.720000000001
basically embrace the flaw and be less

10766.279 --> 10772.399000000001
for it and without God arguably like

10769.72 --> 10774.56
this this esoterics and it really is

10772.399 --> 10777.88
important it's so important to get to

10774.56 --> 10780.359
your young kids when they are having

10777.88 --> 10782.839999999998
psychological issues or whatever that

10780.359 --> 10785.12
you make that clear to them that they

10782.84 --> 10788.8
have like this is like a holy mission

10785.12 --> 10792.560000000001
that like should prioritize

10788.8 --> 10794.88
your like even over death it's like it's

10792.56 --> 10798.519999999999
this is more

10794.88 --> 10800.759999999998
important than any shortterm issue that

10798.52 --> 10805.16
you have

10800.76 --> 10806.880000000001
always embrace it like you're

10805.16 --> 10811.0
not

10806.88 --> 10814.039999999999
Flawless and the world will not pretend

10811.0 --> 10816.12
like you don't have a flaw you got it

10814.04 --> 10817.76
there's nothing you can do about it it's

10816.12 --> 10819.359
going to be there probably the rest of

10817.76 --> 10825.08
your

10819.359 --> 10827.880000000001
life accept it take it take it from God

10825.08 --> 10830.039999999999
it's there in your in your life take it

10827.88 --> 10833.438999999998
accept it if you don't accept it then

10830.04 --> 10833.439
you will truly be

10842.72 --> 10845.72
flawed

10847.56 --> 10854.0
yes Journey a manner to face Their Fear

10850.319 --> 10855.439
exactly that they had cultural accountan

10854.0 --> 10858.399
for it

10855.439 --> 10861.239
yeah and I'm trying to reintroduce that

10858.399 --> 10863.68
I did that I lived through that that

10861.239 --> 10865.56
that challenge conception I thought at

10863.68 --> 10869.800000000001
first that the challenge was indeed like

10865.56 --> 10872.68
oh I need to like defeat an enemy or or

10869.8 --> 10876.599999999999
like be a badass or something and then I

10872.68 --> 10876.6
realized no my challenge is

10877.239 --> 10884.68
psychological during my teens I denied

10881.04 --> 10887.640000000001
my anxiety attacks I denied they existed

10884.68 --> 10891.720000000001
I denied they existed so well that I

10887.64 --> 10895.16
literally was not aware that I had him

10891.72 --> 10898.72
during most of it it was part of my

10895.16 --> 10901.6
overall denial about reality I denied I

10898.72 --> 10902.64
had that and I denied that real evil

10901.6 --> 10905.640000000001
could

10902.64 --> 10905.64
exist

10905.92 --> 10910.16
and that struck back very hard

10908.399 --> 10914.72
eventually

10910.16 --> 10914.72
when yeah when I couldn't escape

10915.88 --> 10922.119999999999
anymore and now I've embraced all of

10919.84 --> 10925.439
that as a life

10922.12 --> 10927.84
Challenge and I'm like hey hey you know

10925.439 --> 10930.92
this thing that's literally consumed my

10927.84 --> 10934.319
entire lifespan on trying to deal with

10930.92 --> 10936.64
it I got some important tips that you

10934.319 --> 10937.72
might want to listen to now that you're

10936.64 --> 10941.16
still

10937.72 --> 10944.519999999999
young yeah so you don't end up being

10941.16 --> 10946.92
like half suicidal periodically because

10944.52 --> 10950.359
like nobody helped you nobody told you

10946.92 --> 10950.359
how to deal with whatever you

10955.319 --> 10960.88
got right and useless

10958.439 --> 10963.279
psychologist completely useless that

10960.88 --> 10965.08
only only They Don't Really follow what

10963.279 --> 10967.800000000001
you're saying they just like oh it's

10965.08 --> 10970.319
this on this level I'll give you this

10967.8 --> 10973.278999999999
medication then like it's all useless

10970.319 --> 10976.359
everything they do is useless it doesn't

10973.279 --> 10979.560000000001
work like that psychological issues are

10976.359 --> 10979.56
like a spiritual

10981.239 --> 10988.199999999999
challenge medication doesn't fix it it

10985.56 --> 10988.199999999999
never

10992.479 --> 10997.64
does unless there's like a physiological

10995.84 --> 11000.359
issue right I

10997.64 --> 11003.039999999999
mean that's

11000.359 --> 11004.720000000001
different if you got diabetes and it's

11003.04 --> 11006.800000000001
like permanent yeah you're going to need

11004.72 --> 11010.88
insulin

11006.8 --> 11012.92
like that sort of thing and even that is

11010.88 --> 11015.92
investigable you

11012.92 --> 11018.239
should because I've heard that with real

11015.92 --> 11021.12
serious holistic approaches you can even

11018.239 --> 11023.56
like get rid of

11021.12 --> 11027.0
diabetes if you can believe such a thing

11023.56 --> 11027.0
I mean I do I believe

11031.68 --> 11037.12
that right but I'm more focused on

11034.2 --> 11039.319000000001
psychological issues and Consciousness

11037.12 --> 11043.359
issues right so that's that's what the

11039.319 --> 11046.64
show is about now today and it's in the

11043.359 --> 11051.399000000001
title and holy [ __ ] it's

11046.64 --> 11055.399
what it's past five damn I didn't even

11051.399 --> 11055.399
have an Illuminati C

11073.08 --> 11076.84
huh skull what

11080.08 --> 11084.0
[Music]

11081.6 --> 11087.359
skull right but that

11084.0 --> 11088.8
Native American tradition with ad ad

11087.359 --> 11091.2
adolescent

11088.8 --> 11094.039999999999
Journey that was a real big thing like

11091.2 --> 11096.16
even in my family like my parents really

11094.04 --> 11098.319000000001
were fascinated with Native Americans I

11096.16 --> 11101.92
got they went and visit them I still

11098.319 --> 11101.92
have that photo as a

11103.359 --> 11108.6
baby and it all always appealed to me

11106.2 --> 11110.479000000001
because I have like a kind of a warrior

11108.6 --> 11112.92
like spirit in

11110.479 --> 11117.08
me and when I was younger I was like

11112.92 --> 11121.16
very eer eager to to do that but

11117.08 --> 11123.76
also I don't know fearful and I was just

11121.16 --> 11127.239
I just have all these emotions in all

11123.76 --> 11130.239
directions like fear anger love

11127.239 --> 11130.239
passion

11134.16 --> 11141.8
everything and I needed guidance right

11137.96 --> 11144.399
needed some way to to like guide it all

11141.8 --> 11147.16
and a mission is really the only

11144.399 --> 11149.039999999999
thing right and that eventually became

11147.16 --> 11151.319
like what it is now like yeah this is

11149.04 --> 11156.239000000001
just like a Priestly thing that I do I

11151.319 --> 11158.96
am my own psycher it's very very

11156.239 --> 11162.319
serious like that's not a joke when I

11158.96 --> 11163.839999999998
say that that's very very serious I a

11162.319 --> 11166.88
psycher

11163.84 --> 11170.8
Layman and I am my number one patient

11166.88 --> 11174.119999999999
and it's very serious like I demand to

11170.8 --> 11176.039999999999
be recognized as such like I know what

11174.12 --> 11177.52
I'm talking about when I'm talking about

11176.04 --> 11180.960000000001
my

11177.52 --> 11183.439
issues doctors need to respect that

11180.96 --> 11185.88
absolutely like or I will literally get

11183.439 --> 11189.04
a lawyer over

11185.88 --> 11191.438999999998
it because I can prove it I can prove

11189.04 --> 11193.359
that I have been a psychologist to

11191.439 --> 11196.84
myself and that I have gotten myself

11193.359 --> 11199.08
under control in many

11196.84 --> 11202.92
ways there's the proof of it in

11199.08 --> 11205.56
conversation I have proven it that it's

11202.92 --> 11207.8
real I really am my own psychologist I

11205.56 --> 11208.76
can prove it I could prove it in a court

11207.8 --> 11213.92
of

11208.76 --> 11213.92
law probably if I really needed

11215.64 --> 11224.72
to is smoking a sin uh it's in nature no

11222.479 --> 11227.039999999999
smoking is not in

11224.72 --> 11228.519999999999
nature it's one of the few things that

11227.04 --> 11232.12
isn't in nature I

11228.52 --> 11237.6
mean grug use is in nature

11232.12 --> 11237.6
arguably but I mean no smoking isn't a

11237.84 --> 11243.960000000001
sin it's just moderation

11241.12 --> 11246.76
moderation know how are you doing it

11243.96 --> 11248.519999999999
moderation and how are you doing it yeah

11246.76 --> 11251.04
what intention are you doing it with are

11248.52 --> 11253.359
you doing it to try to get your mind of

11251.04 --> 11255.279
something or are you doing it because

11253.359 --> 11260.279
it'll give you like another layer

11255.279 --> 11262.6
another depth that you can use not to

11260.279 --> 11264.399000000001
escape but to like actively enjoy

11262.6 --> 11268.279
yourself or something right like are you

11264.399 --> 11269.358999999999
going to use the smoking for therapy or

11268.279 --> 11271.800000000001
as a

11269.359 --> 11273.239
suppressant it's very important to

11271.8 --> 11276.239
distinguish

11273.239 --> 11276.239
that

11277.319 --> 11284.239
yeah because people that are like drug

11280.88 --> 11286.88
addicted they use it as a suppressant

11284.239 --> 11289.16
once you get suppressing then you

11286.88 --> 11290.8
supress a problem the problem grows in

11289.16 --> 11293.52
the background grows stronger and then

11290.8 --> 11296.64
you get a a drug addiction to keep

11293.52 --> 11298.560000000001
pressing it away so are you going to use

11296.64 --> 11301.72
something therapeutical or are you going

11298.56 --> 11304.56
to use it to suppress something that you

11301.72 --> 11307.039999999999
don't want to face it's critical

11304.56 --> 11311.199999999999
critical to think about that with

11307.04 --> 11313.319000000001
anything I mean even coffee and sugar

11311.2 --> 11316.479000000001
all of that how are you taking it are

11313.319 --> 11319.319
you trying to escape something or are

11316.479 --> 11321.92
you actually having therapeutical time

11319.319 --> 11324.519999999999
out of it it's very important to keep

11321.92 --> 11328.2
that in mind as you go along in your

11324.52 --> 11328.2
life and try things

11339.72 --> 11342.88
out all

11345.68 --> 11352.479000000001
right so yeah duper smoking is

11348.6 --> 11354.239
technically not a sin but don't talk

11352.479 --> 11357.039999999999
about

11354.239 --> 11359.479
drugs right this is

11357.04 --> 11360.960000000001
public this is a public thing I mean if

11359.479 --> 11362.679999999998
you're like in a conversation with

11360.96 --> 11365.039999999999
somebody in a private chat that's one

11362.68 --> 11367.439
thing but this is a public

11365.04 --> 11368.68
show so I really kind of want to

11367.439 --> 11372.359
minimize

11368.68 --> 11375.439
that like I don't want the normalization

11372.359 --> 11377.720000000001
of drugs I don't want to like say no

11375.439 --> 11380.6
it's it's perfectly

11377.72 --> 11382.519999999999
cool it's like yeah no we just smoke

11380.6 --> 11386.12
everywhere and do it all the time right

11382.52 --> 11389.04
no no no no don't do

11386.12 --> 11392.560000000001
that

11389.04 --> 11394.92
cuz if yeah that's like saying like

11392.56 --> 11396.92
oh with so many things there's just

11394.92 --> 11399.439
flaws that we have that we do but we got

11396.92 --> 11401.72
to recognize that it's a flaw it's like

11399.439 --> 11403.960000000001
if you're like a sex addicted cheating

11401.72 --> 11406.319
bastard who continually cheats on his

11403.96 --> 11407.839999999998
wife know that it's wrong if you're

11406.319 --> 11409.64
going to be like bragging about it's

11407.84 --> 11412.960000000001
like no I have the right to do that as a

11409.64 --> 11416.278999999999
man then you're literally like

11412.96 --> 11420.919999999998
justifying sin when you do that that's

11416.279 --> 11422.800000000001
when God like really gets you cuz that's

11420.92 --> 11426.239
the actual

11422.8 --> 11429.0
sin is if you say something isn't a sin

11426.239 --> 11430.76
when it isn't you can have issues with

11429.0 --> 11436.16
it you can deal with it you can do the

11430.76 --> 11440.239
sin but know what it is and then accept

11436.16 --> 11442.56
that don't try to create delusions to

11440.239 --> 11444.68
try to flip around reality and say it's

11442.56 --> 11447.359
it's that it's actually a super good

11444.68 --> 11447.359
thing it

11449.239 --> 11455.56
isn't yeah and cannabis is many medical

11452.56 --> 11458.278999999999
qualities absolutely therapeutical

11455.56 --> 11460.278999999999
qualities but you can also get addicted

11458.279 --> 11463.720000000001
to it and use it as a

11460.279 --> 11466.84
suppressive and so it is a

11463.72 --> 11470.438999999998
drug it should be regarded as such

11466.84 --> 11473.279
unless you're specifically talking about

11470.439 --> 11477.880000000001
Therapeutics like CBD

11473.279 --> 11481.640000000001
oil right CBD oil not a drug there's no

11477.88 --> 11486.56
way in which that classifies as a

11481.64 --> 11489.84
drug so that's just how it is

11486.56 --> 11492.119999999999
don't don't normalize sin it's very

11489.84 --> 11494.92
important and it's

11492.12 --> 11498.12
like religious law

11494.92 --> 11500.399
technically it is within Islam and they

11498.12 --> 11504.04
have a very good point with

11500.399 --> 11506.72
that like have your sins but make sure

11504.04 --> 11509.2
that you don't do it in public or that

11506.72 --> 11513.16
you get caught like promoting

11509.2 --> 11516.52
it like it's a good thing because then

11513.16 --> 11519.119999999999
then you get into real trouble legally

11516.52 --> 11521.279
there right and they have a very good

11519.12 --> 11523.560000000001
point with that that's what keeps it

11521.279 --> 11526.2
under control you can't like annihilate

11523.56 --> 11528.8
sin entirely it doesn't work it will

11526.2 --> 11531.479000000001
find its way back you do a lot of damage

11528.8 --> 11533.96
it won't work but if you just say like

11531.479 --> 11536.84
no just don't normalize it don't

11533.96 --> 11540.519999999999
suddenly like oh yes now we should all

11536.84 --> 11544.08
be like I Pro drugs like everybody

11540.52 --> 11546.439
mandatory drugs like give all children

11544.08 --> 11548.52
joints or something right like you know

11546.439 --> 11551.92
that's

11548.52 --> 11555.960000000001
insane but if you allow the

11551.92 --> 11561.08
normalization of sin then some people

11555.96 --> 11564.239
will do that and much much more and much

11561.08 --> 11566.92
much worse you know it it's already

11564.239 --> 11569.319
happening out there it's all because of

11566.92 --> 11571.88
the normalization of it which you

11569.319 --> 11574.0
normalize one thing what's what's going

11571.88 --> 11576.0
to stop you from normalizing the next

11574.0 --> 11579.52
thing and the next thing and worse and

11576.0 --> 11581.439
worse and worse way way way worse

11579.52 --> 11584.6
nothing nothing stops you because if you

11581.439 --> 11585.960000000001
take one finger you could take an entire

11584.6 --> 11588.960000000001
hand

11585.96 --> 11590.72
eventually if you give them one finger

11588.96 --> 11594.56
if you give the demons one finger

11590.72 --> 11594.56
they'll take everything everything

11599.12 --> 11603.399000000001
right it's very important part also

11602.279 --> 11608.239
about this

11603.399 --> 11610.88
whole introspective section

11608.239 --> 11615.64
introspective section of the

11610.88 --> 11615.64
show kic blow backs yeah that

11621.56 --> 11624.56
too

11624.68 --> 11629.720000000001
it no XX don't I'm not judging you this

11627.439 --> 11631.2
is not about whether you take it every

11629.72 --> 11634.199999999999
day or not it's

11631.2 --> 11634.2
about

11638.439 --> 11643.359
normalization yeah I smoke arguably

11641.279 --> 11645.16
every day almost every day I didn't a

11643.359 --> 11648.359
while back because I just couldn't

11645.16 --> 11651.479
afford anything about it and then I

11648.359 --> 11654.479000000001
can't live without it I get cranky but I

11651.479 --> 11654.479
mean

11657.76 --> 11663.76
I don't continually talk about it I

11660.399 --> 11668.08
don't smoke on

11663.76 --> 11671.56
camera right I do that for a reason I do

11668.08 --> 11674.039999999999
that for God because I know that's

11671.56 --> 11677.519999999999
you're not supposed to do that plenty of

11674.04 --> 11680.399000000001
people out there that do it oh

11677.52 --> 11682.52
go I'm

11680.399 --> 11684.599999999999
like that's not what I'm coming here

11682.52 --> 11687.640000000001
here to do I'm not here to be some

11684.6 --> 11690.960000000001
online coffee shop for people where they

11687.64 --> 11692.84
can just hang and chill man whatever and

11690.96 --> 11693.88
hey maybe that has its own place I'm

11692.84 --> 11697.8
here

11693.88 --> 11700.479
for more of a church

11697.8 --> 11703.358999999999
experience kind of

11700.479 --> 11705.039999999999
right I'm like a priest it's all about

11703.359 --> 11706.76
the mission it's all about mental

11705.04 --> 11710.319000000001
Clarity it's all about honesty about

11706.76 --> 11714.399
confrontation about complex life issues

11710.319 --> 11714.399
and being honest about it and open

11714.84 --> 11721.439
that is what I expect to do in church if

11718.2 --> 11724.52
I go to a church what I do is what I

11721.439 --> 11727.199
expect them to be like I've never seen

11724.52 --> 11729.199
it though the best the closest I've

11727.199 --> 11730.960000000001
gotten is that people that are not

11729.199 --> 11733.08
judgmental about you and that really

11730.96 --> 11736.438999999998
want to help you and that's already like

11733.08 --> 11738.319
wow that's amazing but I mean that's as

11736.439 --> 11739.800000000001
far as it went because beyond that they

11738.319 --> 11742.6
literally proved that they just don't

11739.8 --> 11745.0
know what the hell they're doing at all

11742.6 --> 11748.800000000001
and they just go with the current

11745.0 --> 11751.479
thing right so not really my church if

11748.8 --> 11753.319
there is any any church out there that

11751.479 --> 11756.479
was that would

11753.319 --> 11757.359
suffice so since I don't expect to bump

11756.479 --> 11760.16
into

11757.359 --> 11762.960000000001
any I'm doing

11760.16 --> 11766.199
it just one guy

11762.96 --> 11770.88
online the way I do it don't always do

11766.199 --> 11770.880000000001
it but it is an item that comes

11771.319 --> 11776.84
back and so I'm doing

11773.88 --> 11780.64
that I couldn't find the right church so

11776.84 --> 11780.64
I had to become

11794.96 --> 11797.96
one

11798.479 --> 11804.278999999999
what my body Church yeah yeah

11821.12 --> 11827.880000000001
kic blow back from yes blow yeah you get

11824.16 --> 11827.88
it and there is there really

11828.56 --> 11834.198999999999
is and you'll feel it too like as you're

11832.0 --> 11837.84
doing it you'll feel like

11834.199 --> 11840.279
this like hey you're going too far

11837.84 --> 11843.239
you're not supposed to do this you'll

11840.279 --> 11845.560000000001
feel an energy

11843.239 --> 11848.16
happening I don't know if You' ever

11845.56 --> 11849.64
noticed that I I have because I have

11848.16 --> 11851.69
like made my

11849.64 --> 11852.84
mistakes in the

11851.69 --> 11856.279
[Music]

11852.84 --> 11857.84
past and there would like if I promote

11856.279 --> 11860.359
sin and

11857.84 --> 11862.64
[ __ ] not really understanding it not

11860.359 --> 11864.84
like I want to be evil but just not

11862.64 --> 11867.68
understanding it like I would get

11864.84 --> 11870.8
freaking nightmares literally it's like

11867.68 --> 11873.12
the devil would come to me in my dreams

11870.8 --> 11875.319
and be like oh you're liking all this

11873.12 --> 11879.279
and then literally just start punishing

11875.319 --> 11881.84
me and I wouldn't even

11879.279 --> 11886.52
understand

11881.84 --> 11891.12
because my moral compass in ways when I

11886.52 --> 11894.12
was younger was just like confused about

11891.12 --> 11894.12
things

11895.12 --> 11899.92
it was it's just that's what it was I

11898.04 --> 11903.880000000001
mean the world's really freaking

11899.92 --> 11905.88
confusing so I mean can you blame me we

11903.88 --> 11907.92
didn't like go to church or anything we

11905.88 --> 11910.039999999999
weren't like Christian family in that

11907.92 --> 11913.479
sense we're just like respectful for

11910.04 --> 11916.439
Christ and that and like open to all

11913.479 --> 11919.84
these ideas very like all over the place

11916.439 --> 11922.359
like oh look into this look into

11919.84 --> 11924.439
that I really liked a lot of like the

11922.359 --> 11926.720000000001
Jewish stuff

11924.439 --> 11930.319
actually I thought like this is really

11926.72 --> 11930.319
interesting they sound very

11931.84 --> 11939.04
wise right but I never

11936.479 --> 11942.08
like yeah my parents were just

11939.04 --> 11944.279
eventually just caught up in so much

11942.08 --> 11948.08
fighting with one another and

11944.279 --> 11951.04
just that I couldn't learn anything from

11948.08 --> 11954.039999999999
I was too busy with that

11951.04 --> 11954.04
[ __ ]

11965.479 --> 11970.8
and so I would do things that were an

11968.199 --> 11972.960000000001
error sort of like no I'm a liberal I'm

11970.8 --> 11977.479
like all futuristic it felt like that oh

11972.96 --> 11977.479
if I just help promote this I'll be all

11980.84 --> 11984.880000000001
futuristic right

11982.88 --> 11987.519999999999
and there was a really weird thing with

11984.88 --> 11989.599999999999
me that did eventually change but you

11987.52 --> 11993.479000000001
got to realize I was kind of

11989.6 --> 11996.76
like a virgin until I was 18 so it's

11993.479 --> 12001.76
like perfectly legal it's really funny

11996.76 --> 12003.12
in retrospect but like before that time

12001.76 --> 12005.0
I did

12003.12 --> 12008.800000000001
not

12005.0 --> 12011.08
understand pedophilia like I really

12008.8 --> 12013.64
really didn't understand not as like why

12011.08 --> 12016.52
would you wanted I I didn't understand

12013.64 --> 12019.278999999999
like why it was damaging I didn't

12016.52 --> 12023.16
understand anything about it and it was

12019.279 --> 12025.279
just really strange to me like I didn't

12023.16 --> 12028.319
understand why people would have issues

12025.279 --> 12030.560000000001
with it which is very freaky now

12028.319 --> 12033.6
thinking back like oh my

12030.56 --> 12035.72
God like I'm scared of it I'm scared

12033.6 --> 12039.720000000001
that I didn't understand it back then

12035.72 --> 12042.519999999999
I'm scared about that I I get it now I

12039.72 --> 12045.358999999999
will never forget it

12042.52 --> 12047.279
but like I don't understand why I didn't

12045.359 --> 12049.239
understand back then that's very

12047.279 --> 12052.439
puzzling to

12049.239 --> 12052.439
me it's

12054.16 --> 12061.56
freaky like I never had any

12058.479 --> 12065.08
Ambitions in that direction at all it's

12061.56 --> 12068.039999999999
just I didn't get it I was kind of like

12065.08 --> 12069.68
I guess liberal and I'm like yeah if you

12068.04 --> 12073.04
if

12069.68 --> 12076.720000000001
it's what do you say it uh

12073.04 --> 12079.160000000002
consensual why not I was just like yeah

12076.72 --> 12082.56
why not because I was just thinking of

12079.16 --> 12086.439
me as being younger like yeah but I

12082.56 --> 12089.16
wanted to have sex right I was just

12086.439 --> 12091.68
thinking like

12089.16 --> 12093.72
that but I mean all of that [ __ ] did

12091.68 --> 12096.12
absolutely stop when I got my first

12093.72 --> 12099.84
girlfriend

12096.12 --> 12101.439
though then yeah that does kind of like

12099.84 --> 12105.399
energetically change you when you have

12101.439 --> 12108.479000000001
sex and and all that or it did with me

12105.399 --> 12108.479
and then I was

12109.359 --> 12115.04
like starting to feel it like wait there

12113.439 --> 12117.199
is something really wrong with this

12115.04 --> 12119.880000000001
pedophilia [ __ ] and like why do all

12117.199 --> 12122.279
those people that are sort of into it

12119.88 --> 12124.96
why do they look like completely creepy

12122.279 --> 12127.239
and [ __ ] why is there something really

12124.96 --> 12128.88
creepy about and that's when it really

12127.239 --> 12131.039999999999
that's when I started to see it it's

12128.88 --> 12133.039999999999
like suddenly I started to see the

12131.04 --> 12136.359
demons that were always there but I was

12133.04 --> 12136.359
somehow blinded to

12136.72 --> 12140.039999999999
it very

12147.64 --> 12152.519999999999
weird but that still kind of freaks me

12150.08 --> 12154.96
out that that happened in my

12152.52 --> 12155.960000000001
past just that I didn't understand it I

12154.96 --> 12158.679999999998
didn't do

12155.96 --> 12161.839999999998
anything didn't touch anybody didn't

12158.68 --> 12164.0
have any Ambitions like I've always

12161.84 --> 12165.6
always since I was

12164.0 --> 12169.08
five

12165.6 --> 12170.439
five was I like I want a wife I want

12169.08 --> 12172.279
children with a wife I want to protect

12170.439 --> 12175.04
the wife I want to love him I want to

12172.279 --> 12177.439
like grow all together and die together

12175.04 --> 12181.239000000001
or something like it's always been my

12177.439 --> 12183.08
dream it's never changed never never had

12181.239 --> 12185.198999999999
anything like oh I want to have sex with

12183.08 --> 12187.479
what I want to have absolutely I don't

12185.199 --> 12192.239000000001
even want to just like oh have sex with

12187.479 --> 12194.72
some woman randomly that I just met no

12192.239 --> 12198.16
absolutely not I'm like very

12194.72 --> 12200.84
oldfashioned like that very oldfashioned

12198.16 --> 12204.0
it's really bizarre because I don't

12200.84 --> 12205.960000000001
really look super oldfashioned I don't

12204.0 --> 12208.6
really necessarily talk super

12205.96 --> 12211.0
oldfashioned but when it comes to that I

12208.6 --> 12214.0
am and I always was I was just born like

12211.0 --> 12216.52
that but I'm still freaked out that in

12214.0 --> 12219.0
my teens like I didn't understand I

12216.52 --> 12220.880000000001
didn't see the demon of pedophilia like

12219.0 --> 12222.6
why it was wrong and that freaks me out

12220.88 --> 12224.88
that I didn't get it

12222.6 --> 12228.52
and people tried to explain it to me

12224.88 --> 12232.119999999999
even and it just I like I could couldn't

12228.52 --> 12234.76
see it like why am I blinded by this why

12232.12 --> 12234.76
can't I see

12235.56 --> 12240.92
it and it scared me because I did get to

12239.199 --> 12244.04
understand like yeah pedophilia is

12240.92 --> 12245.84
really hated it's really hated and it's

12244.04 --> 12250.279
really evil people thought it was really

12245.84 --> 12252.479
evil and I'm like okay but I just didn't

12250.279 --> 12255.0
understand it I didn't

12252.479 --> 12259.0
understand it and well that that has

12255.0 --> 12262.52
since changed I definitely understand it

12259.0 --> 12262.52
now oh my

12267.72 --> 12278.16
God is it yeah like I have a Savage

12274.72 --> 12280.198999999999
hatred towards those demons perhaps

12278.16 --> 12282.399
perhaps even more because when I was

12280.199 --> 12283.560000000001
younger I didn't see it I didn't see

12282.399 --> 12287.479
they were

12283.56 --> 12289.119999999999
demons and that freaks me out it freaks

12287.479 --> 12290.519999999999
me out that for a while I was kind of

12289.12 --> 12293.199
blind to

12290.52 --> 12294.92
him and I have like I guess a natural

12293.199 --> 12297.0
instinct like I want if I'm going to

12294.92 --> 12299.84
have children at some I want to protect

12297.0 --> 12303.479
them from

12299.84 --> 12307.16
that so that they don't even have to

12303.479 --> 12310.438999999998
think about it at that age at

12307.16 --> 12312.399
all like in a way like how Omen Benjamin

12310.439 --> 12315.68
does it with his kids like

12312.399 --> 12315.68
that's that's

12316.6 --> 12320.720000000001
amazing like that's the way I want would

12319.16 --> 12322.279
want to do it I don't know if I could

12320.72 --> 12324.8
you know being in the Netherlands and

12322.279 --> 12326.92
all like I don't think so maybe if if

12324.8 --> 12330.16
things really change around otherwise I

12326.92 --> 12333.210000000001
might have to like move to Idaho or

12330.16 --> 12336.5
something yeah probably not

12333.21 --> 12336.5
[Music]

12340.479 --> 12347.72
but

12343.0 --> 12348.76
what plenty in net Spain what yeah I'll

12347.72 --> 12351.76
figure it

12348.76 --> 12353.800000000001
out I'll figure it out as we

12351.76 --> 12357.960000000001
go right I

12353.8 --> 12360.198999999999
mean I have technically a higher

12357.96 --> 12364.64
priority like I'm not going to like

12360.199 --> 12368.0
create a family no matter what it is

12364.64 --> 12371.198999999999
definitely it matters what it matters

12368.0 --> 12373.08
like how how it works around us like if

12371.199 --> 12376.880000000001
my kids are literally going to be forced

12373.08 --> 12378.76
to sit through some evil satanic sjw

12376.88 --> 12380.839999999998
that's going to like try to drive pedo

12378.76 --> 12384.52
ideas in their heads at a very young age

12380.84 --> 12387.6
like that is absolutely

12384.52 --> 12390.52
unacceptable cuz I would get like really

12387.6 --> 12392.12
Savage on those people like I couldn't

12390.52 --> 12395.12
stop it

12392.12 --> 12395.12
like

12396.08 --> 12402.68
so my destiny is crushed the ball but

12398.96 --> 12404.759999999998
it's already done it's already done

12402.68 --> 12406.6
the balls already crushed and the balls

12404.76 --> 12408.6
that are still out there in people's

12406.6 --> 12413.640000000001
minds and they refuse to let it go you

12408.6 --> 12417.960000000001
can't Crush an idea XXX yeah ideas are

12413.64 --> 12417.96
bulletproof even if they're wrong

12420.8 --> 12426.319
ideas you can't convince somebody that

12423.479 --> 12426.319
doesn't want to be

12427.399 --> 12435.119999999999
convinced right argument Wise It's

12430.439 --> 12438.56
already over was over like 4 years

12435.12 --> 12442.960000000001
ago it's already

12438.56 --> 12444.6
over Earth is flat measured

12442.96 --> 12447.438999999998
calculated

12444.6 --> 12450.439
visibly navigated

12447.439 --> 12453.319
flat it's all flat that's the only way

12450.439 --> 12456.720000000001
it is and like that's

12453.319 --> 12458.92
it and the rest is all just nuh oh we

12456.72 --> 12462.039999999999
you don't need this you don't need oh we

12458.92 --> 12464.68
do it slightly like this oh you see you

12462.04 --> 12469.399000000001
so you don't need all those this all

12464.68 --> 12469.399
just a bunch of nonsense excuses

12469.52 --> 12477.84
like they can always make up more

12473.479 --> 12481.88
excuses but they can never dissuade me

12477.84 --> 12484.239
into believing that the Earth isn't flat

12481.88 --> 12487.399
CU it is it's everything everything

12484.239 --> 12490.239
proves the Earth is flat

12487.399 --> 12493.239
everything nothing Pro the Earth is

12490.239 --> 12493.239
curved

12499.04 --> 12504.76
so I mean

12501.16 --> 12508.039999999999
yeah I'll bring it up but it's really

12504.76 --> 12509.800000000001
not all that it's not everything I talk

12508.04 --> 12512.560000000001
about

12509.8 --> 12515.0
right I mean Flat Earth is has become

12512.56 --> 12518.399
really more like a subject in the

12515.0 --> 12518.399
palette of things that I talk

12520.199 --> 12523.199
about

12526.56 --> 12529.96
Mar Ballers hiding on Tik

12530.479 --> 12535.119999999999
Tok are they really hiding it's weird to

12533.64 --> 12538.439
say they're hiding when they're just

12535.12 --> 12538.439
like making videos and

12540.399 --> 12544.92
everything but maybe they're hiding on

12542.6 --> 12546.640000000001
Tik Tok because Nathan goes around and

12544.92 --> 12550.16
like

12546.64 --> 12551.84
reviews videos and he doesn't go to Tik

12550.16 --> 12553.399
Tok videos so maybe that's why they're

12551.84 --> 12556.399
hiding

12553.399 --> 12556.399
then

12580.12 --> 12583.12
there

12594.359 --> 12600.880000000001
if you say Black

12596.64 --> 12603.119999999999
Swan I put 2014

12600.88 --> 12607.479
again yeah but they'll just say oh

12603.12 --> 12609.319000000001
refracted or some somehow like distract

12607.479 --> 12613.039999999999
they'll mostly just spend all their time

12609.319 --> 12613.039999999999
trying to distract away what that act

12613.359 --> 12619.399000000001
means right they might go oh refraction

12616.76 --> 12622.880000000001
this proof the black one it doesn't or

12619.399 --> 12622.88
they'll just be like very

12623.12 --> 12628.880000000001
convoluted like actively misund

12627.319 --> 12631.56
understanding the Black Swan

12628.88 --> 12634.239
argument cuz that's what they do with it

12631.56 --> 12637.119999999999
like they never overcame the Black Swan

12634.239 --> 12640.76
really they just got stuck in the arnian

12637.12 --> 12644.76
Paradox I mean it's even named after me

12640.76 --> 12644.76
how significant has that become

12652.76 --> 12658.56
eh all right anyhow I'm gonna get some

12656.56 --> 12662.278999999999
rogans up

12658.56 --> 12665.039999999999
today let me refresh three I mean really

12662.279 --> 12665.04
three that's

12668.199 --> 12672.960000000001
it there's been 10 people here

12683.279 --> 12688.04
4 I see okay right but yeah I'm going to

12686.319 --> 12692.8
round out the show

12688.04 --> 12694.359
now because it's past half past 6 uh

12692.8 --> 12696.84
half past

12694.359 --> 12698.08
5 been going through three and a half

12696.84 --> 12701.439
hours

12698.08 --> 12706.56
already I guess the first two hours were

12701.439 --> 12710.04
a bit slow but then I got really into

12706.56 --> 12711.88
it and I do like putting down the whole

12710.04 --> 12714.199
face your inner problems to gain God's

12711.88 --> 12716.358999999999
reward and all that I really like that

12714.199 --> 12717.960000000001
it's to me extremely motivating

12716.359 --> 12720.68
especially because like no matter how

12717.96 --> 12722.16
terrible you feel it's like yeah I'm

12720.68 --> 12724.12
going to get a reward that's just going

12722.16 --> 12726.96
to be

12724.12 --> 12729.160000000002
exactly equal and opposite of how

12726.96 --> 12731.438999999998
terrible I feel so that you have like

12729.16 --> 12734.319
yeah it's so terrible well that means

12731.439 --> 12738.04
the reward is going to be really great

12734.319 --> 12742.16
and that that just helps it helps

12738.04 --> 12745.199
you like you can face Terrible Things

12742.16 --> 12748.199
way better when you just like

12745.199 --> 12750.6
know it's

12748.199 --> 12753.92
good you don't just see like oh I'm

12750.6 --> 12757.04
going to die like no just trust

12753.92 --> 12759.960000000001
God you're facing it for a reason if you

12757.04 --> 12762.199
just face it it'll be bad but I mean you

12759.96 --> 12765.759999999998
will have a reward war that will equal

12762.199 --> 12768.16
how bad it was you really will like you

12765.76 --> 12769.960000000001
will just do it a couple of times and

12768.16 --> 12773.64
you will

12769.96 --> 12774.438999999998
know you will know with that about it

12773.64 --> 12776.64
right

12774.439 --> 12778.720000000001
anyway sorry for asking so much don't

12776.64 --> 12780.72
worry about it dude you sent me a PayPal

12778.72 --> 12782.76
and everything it's been a good

12780.72 --> 12786.0
conversation you're a little hard to

12782.76 --> 12789.76
decipher sometimes but I think like I do

12786.0 --> 12792.76
like get the gist of what you're saying

12789.76 --> 12792.76
mostly

12792.96 --> 12798.08
just be very careful with the spell

12794.68 --> 12798.08
correcting because that makes it

12800.6 --> 12807.319
worse working on it no that's great hey

12803.84 --> 12810.439
and working on it requires

12807.319 --> 12812.0
practice so that means

12810.439 --> 12815.12
more

12812.0 --> 12817.0
anyway I'm going to round out thanks
