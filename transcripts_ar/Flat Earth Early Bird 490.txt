okay thanks Robin Stanley yeah good

184.43 --> 192.909
morning all

185.379 --> 192.909
it's Friday last Friday of March 2020

196.03 --> 201.47
got the feeling there's a crazy month

198.409 --> 206.51
coming all kinds of craziness next month

201.47 --> 210.73
I think everybody's fellas coming almost

206.51 --> 215.87
kind of bracing for it spiritually but

210.73 --> 218.92999999999998
yeah mostly concerned with the now last

215.87 --> 223.329
Friday of the year what is that Chinese

218.93 --> 223.329
year or something I don't know

237.79 --> 243.31
yeah giving out a couple of wrenches

250.41 --> 259.829
April is this [ __ ] hit the fan month

252.879 --> 262.99
maybe maybe or maybe it is just just the

259.829 --> 265.84000000000003
it's the fools month maybe it is the

262.99 --> 274.38
month when the heaviest of tricks will

265.84 --> 277.53999999999996
be subjected to us I don't know for sure

274.38 --> 280.57
but at least to say the least it will

277.54 --> 282.72900000000004
appear like a lot is happening now

280.57 --> 284.86
whether those things are really all

282.729 --> 288.90999999999997
exactly happening as is that's another

284.86 --> 291.19
matter but we'll see about that it's for

288.91 --> 295.02000000000004
us to figure out once again it's the

291.19 --> 295.02
game that we are being forced to play

296.669 --> 300.389
among mind-warped

302.85 --> 307.73
yeah so yesterday I kept up pretty late

309.2 --> 318.09
kept me up all kinds of thing I didn't

313.8 --> 323.85
know I was around indeed live live yeah

318.09 --> 327.0
I remember again watching on Benjamin

323.85 --> 329.97
but the ice cream was really damn choppy

327.0 --> 333.72
so I could barely follow it I don't know

329.97 --> 336.93
if that was just my connection but yeah

333.72 --> 340.05
it you know it was crushing it I think

336.93 --> 342.3
but yeah it was just hampering so badly

340.05 --> 345.06
that I couldn't make out half the things

342.3 --> 347.88
he was saying so that was kind of

345.06 --> 350.79
annoying fortunately it did not get

347.88 --> 351.56
restream Dandi life because usually when

350.79 --> 357.12
they do that

351.56 --> 361.4
it doesn't get his choppy oh well yes

357.12 --> 365.01
you can always have what you want yeah I

361.4 --> 369.41999999999996
think I watched some ugly Jew - sure

365.01 --> 372.51
again and then yeah right because ugly

369.42 --> 374.7
Joe was on pretty late and then I think

372.51 --> 376.65
it was his birthday or something like

374.7 --> 380.49
people were giving him all kinds of

376.65 --> 382.22999999999996
piles of lemons and all that so happy

380.49 --> 386.91
birthday - ugh lead you if that is true

382.23 --> 389.22
and yeah he got all kinds of people on

386.91 --> 391.29
you even had like a Nathan Stockman off

389.22 --> 394.08000000000004
lift to fail on his show it was kind of

391.29 --> 395.70000000000005
odd to hear several people I think they

394.08 --> 398.7
were all pretty much live streamers on

395.7 --> 401.94
real life they all got together just

398.7 --> 403.92
talking about things but yeah that was

401.94 --> 406.14
really late so eventually I just caught

403.92 --> 407.97
it off and just went to bed because I

406.14 --> 415.5
didn't want to make it incredibly late

407.97 --> 418.08000000000004
again also watching some Alex Jones here

415.5 --> 420.32
and there and I guess that's pretty much

418.08 --> 420.32
it

421.59 --> 429.47999999999996
watch the restream from yesterday's flat

423.96 --> 434.34
earth debates right yeah thank ya I kind

429.48 --> 440.88
of like Nate Nathan Stockman too but

434.34 --> 442.67999999999995
I don't know he is a bit of a oh yeah it

440.88 --> 445.71
seems like he's just cooking really bad

442.68 --> 450.33
- the corona then again he's also it

445.71 --> 452.25
also lives in New York I think so you

450.33 --> 453.87
just have something to be worried a

452.25 --> 454.8
little bit more worried about than the

453.87 --> 458.55
average person

454.8 --> 463.86
but yeah I did like him but man

458.55 --> 467.22
sometimes he get like a bit drowning in

463.86 --> 469.56
fear porn but it seems like he's not

467.22 --> 472.77000000000004
doing it to hype it up to other people

469.56 --> 475.35
he's just genuinely nervous about it I

472.77 --> 479.15999999999997
don't know it gets on my nerves a little

475.35 --> 484.29
sometimes but I like his coverage of

479.16 --> 487.5
news and all that buy a package of

484.29 --> 490.91900000000004
toilet paper honey so thank you bait 60

487.5 --> 496.65
RMC 420 canadian dollar super detonation

490.919 --> 499.26
i have plenty of toilet paper and yet

496.65 --> 501.53999999999996
like all the stores they've been filled

499.26 --> 503.669
up back with toilet paper anyway so

501.54 --> 506.03000000000003
there's really no shortage it was just a

503.669 --> 506.03
moment

510.97 --> 514.69
are you gaining wisdom

514.789 --> 517.939
[Music]

530.32 --> 533.13
hmm

535.06 --> 545.1999999999999
what I'm trying to figure out what

537.73 --> 550.15
you're talking about here all of you dr.

545.2 --> 552.97
Kaufman crowd triple7 oh that sounds

550.15 --> 556.2099999999999
like another German doctor doing a story

552.97 --> 559.08
is that true because yeah there's a lot

556.21 --> 559.08
of them going around

575.37 --> 581.61
so crackdown on cash in the Netherlands

577.98 --> 584.49
well mind-warped sort of look there's

581.61 --> 586.44
they're subjecting everyone through

584.49 --> 587.91
media through government with all the

586.44 --> 589.4100000000001
indoctrination [ __ ] that they've

587.91 --> 592.17
tried to ram through in the last twenty

589.41 --> 596.31
years pretty much in a way including

592.17 --> 600.54
cashless and some stores have kind of

596.31 --> 603.0889999999999
now taken down that option it's like no

600.54 --> 605.88
because of the virus it's just use your

603.089 --> 608.2790000000001
your cash card because that will

605.88 --> 610.4399999999999
minimize touching cash in blah blah blah

608.279 --> 614.279
but not all stores are doing it thank

610.44 --> 617.19
God because that would be annoying

614.279 --> 619.41
like if there's no where you could use

617.19 --> 622.2600000000001
cash anymore then it then it really

619.41 --> 625.89
becomes annoying but I think that

622.26 --> 637.26
probably most grocery stores all stopped

625.89 --> 638.97
using cash here but I don't know you

637.26 --> 643.08
know the Netherlands I think has always

638.97 --> 645.57
been pretty damn divided concerning yeah

643.08 --> 650.0400000000001
leftists that are just like no just do

645.57 --> 652.5600000000001
everything just do it all the cashless I

650.04 --> 655.05
was it the basic income just everything

652.56 --> 658.76
all of it they're all in a rush to get

655.05 --> 661.8599999999999
it because that's what they've become

658.76 --> 665.04
but on the other hand there's plenty of

661.86 --> 668.4300000000001
Dutch people that are yeah quite aware

665.04 --> 671.8499999999999
of better basically educated from the

668.43 --> 674.55
conspiracy theorist route just like I

671.85 --> 676.77
have and they're all very much where'd

674.55 --> 679.9399999999999
like now this is just all bad news and

676.77 --> 683.99
we can't let them do it unfortunately

679.94 --> 686.97
though yeah a lot of liberals are just

683.99 --> 691.55
very much go along to get along types

686.97 --> 694.5500000000001
and they're all they'll all just say yes

691.55 --> 694.55
so

694.66 --> 701.23
have a Heineken me you know no thanks

697.45 --> 703.51
Bates sixty RMC I don't really like

okay okay the Robin said look you know

771.3 --> 777.8199999999999
Dutch bears are like the general vent

774.73 --> 780.13
there okay I guess could be worse

777.82 --> 783.75
I just I don't drink them anymore I I

780.13 --> 783.75
really stick to organic beers

791.93 --> 796.3299999999999
attack all free will you know a little

798.97 --> 805.73
what's playing out is pretty damn basic

801.8 --> 808.16
it is so basic that there's there's

805.73 --> 810.6700000000001
almost no way you can't really figure

808.16 --> 815.7199999999999
out what it is even if you've been very

810.67 --> 818.0889999999999
attractive to do figuring out how the

815.72 --> 820.82
world works if you're very attractive to

818.089 --> 825.98
that there's just no way that anybody

820.82 --> 832.0
can not see what is happening that there

825.98 --> 835.4590000000001
is a government you could say communists

832.0 --> 838.61
move a move to get to become more

835.459 --> 843.3499999999999
communist pretty much in the entire West

838.61 --> 845.9590000000001
and maybe more Oh moving the bar that

843.35 --> 847.82
that's how all happening due to corona

845.959 --> 849.9499999999999
situation while at the same time there's

847.82 --> 853.13
plenty of information coming out from

849.95 --> 856.13
all sides that the corona that there's

853.13 --> 858.529
just something weird about it and it's

856.13 --> 860.45
super hyped on one side and on the other

858.529 --> 865.01
side that's just data coming out that

860.45 --> 866.99
it's actually not that special and when

865.01 --> 871.49
you compare the statistics to last year

866.99 --> 873.62
for example apparently I didn't even

871.49 --> 875.089
realize this as much it just goes to

873.62 --> 877.97
show that if something is not being

875.089 --> 881.24
hyped people will kind of forget about

877.97 --> 883.01
it it's it's even I you just it slipped

881.24 --> 886.79
your mind it slips your attention so

883.01 --> 890.99
last year apparently for the US the US

886.79 --> 894.56
had basically had the highest confirmed

890.99 --> 897.2
flu deaths in over thirty years or

894.56 --> 899.779
something or maybe forty a lot a lot of

897.2 --> 902.779
time very high flu deaths in the United

899.779 --> 906.62
States last year are all confirmed so

902.779 --> 909.2
not just preliminary things you know no

906.62 --> 914.36
not some high pitch test no record

909.2 --> 916.5200000000001
amount so oh wow man do you thank you so

914.36 --> 918.62
much for the $5 super children I will

916.52 --> 921.41
check out my PayPal thank you I can't

918.62 --> 923.419
wait to check it out but first

921.41 --> 925.9699999999999
yeah last year in the United States had

923.419 --> 929.149
a record amount of flu deaths compared

925.97 --> 931.249
to a long time and nobody's really heard

929.149 --> 936.949
about it they really kept it under the

931.249 --> 939.349
table and the media did too and now it's

936.949 --> 942.8589999999999
probably gonna be the lowest amount of

939.349 --> 946.609
flu related deaths in the United States

942.859 --> 948.619
for a long time yet it's the media the

946.609 --> 953.089
government is playing it out like it is

948.619 --> 954.679
the worst case scenario giving that

953.089 --> 961.389
feeling giving that spirit do you

954.679 --> 967.009
realize it is it is such craziness that

961.389 --> 970.519
there's just there's no way there's just

967.009 --> 972.589
no way that anybody would not be able to

970.519 --> 974.389
figure out that there's something there

972.589 --> 977.629
there's a whole lot of things wrong with

974.389 --> 979.879
this situation there's just no way you

977.629 --> 982.749
got to be like a hundred percent drone

979.879 --> 986.629
that literally does not think and only

982.749 --> 989.989
responds to what it's is being told and

986.629 --> 992.059
then I don't know maybe then even you

989.989 --> 993.47
couldn't maybe that's the idea maybe

992.059 --> 995.439
that's the point maybe this is a ball

993.47 --> 997.9390000000001
about the Double Down syndrome it's like

995.439 --> 1000.069
okay we're gonna be very blatant the

997.939 --> 1005.4889999999999
office if you go along with this for

1000.069 --> 1007.9889999999999
real and it's all on you all on you and

1005.489 --> 1011.859
what what does that mean does that mean

1007.989 --> 1015.149
that then they will allow to get worse

1011.859 --> 1017.6790000000001
not necessarily I think it's more

1015.149 --> 1020.889
directed towards the people that are

1017.679 --> 1024.12
just going full in and that they will be

1020.889 --> 1027.009
I don't know tagged with consequences

1024.12 --> 1029.6989999999998
this sounds very bizarre and you know it

1027.009 --> 1029.699
kind of ethereal

1032.569 --> 1041.569
that yeah I've been hearing some people

1038.899 --> 1044.389
say interesting things from wider

1041.569 --> 1049.759
yeah from different angles sting going

1044.389 --> 1051.769
around like yeah whatever contracts had

1049.759 --> 1054.35
been made as it were like between

1051.769 --> 1056.6
government and people originally and

1054.35 --> 1059.08
between God and the government and the

1056.6 --> 1062.83
people and all that it seems like

1059.08 --> 1067.34
whatever they're doing they're our

1062.83 --> 1071.4499999999998
original contracts basically it almost

1067.34 --> 1076.6999999999998
like it's being broken like like the

1071.45 --> 1078.529
system itself like even the ethereal do

1076.7 --> 1081.0800000000002
that you could say the magical backdrop

1078.529 --> 1088.039
of the entire structure like it is

1081.08 --> 1090.4399999999998
breaking apart because yeah maybe you

1088.039 --> 1092.889
could consider it like this the original

1090.44 --> 1098.269
contract for the whole thing to happen

1092.889 --> 1102.889
has basically expired yep there's plenty

1098.269 --> 1106.3990000000001
of need or fear pushing for it can to

1102.889 --> 1109.6999999999998
continue so it is kind of now the entire

1106.399 --> 1113.1789999999999
thing all of it moving more into words

1109.7 --> 1115.7
Bluff and trying to get around with

1113.179 --> 1119.96
bluff because any original contract

1115.7 --> 1121.1290000000001
conditions they've all expired something

1119.96 --> 1124.3990000000001
like that I don't know this sounds very

1121.129 --> 1127.24
fake but I got a couple of those hints

1124.399 --> 1129.889
like yeah do the original contracts

1127.24 --> 1134.269
they've just broken them so whatever

1129.889 --> 1137.7199999999998
they're gonna try to do on us we really

1134.269 --> 1141.379
do not have to go along with it and this

1137.72 --> 1144.95
kind of system has been around like here

1141.379 --> 1147.4699999999998
and there in places like police tell you

1144.95 --> 1149.299
a certain thing and yeah you just go

1147.47 --> 1150.6200000000001
along Dennis on you but if you realize

1149.299 --> 1154.37
how it really works

1150.62 --> 1156.83
tell them like no this is law that you

1154.37 --> 1159.5
be very careful your approach then yeah

1156.83 --> 1162.08
there's nothing they can do and I think

1159.5 --> 1165.72
that concept that principle that detail

1162.08 --> 1169.649
is gonna pop up a lot more

1165.72 --> 1172.07
in just how things start to work in what

1169.649 --> 1175.549
their move what the moves they make

1172.07 --> 1178.019
there they're creeping up of rules are

1175.549 --> 1184.799
more gonna be based on bluff and

1178.019 --> 1188.309
illusion compared to the past that's my

1184.799 --> 1194.1
suspicion no proof of this not direct

1188.309 --> 1196.98
proof but yeah I think that's roughly

1194.1 --> 1199.1689999999999
what its gonna be like so the world's

1196.98 --> 1201.929
gonna seem a lot more crazy but if you

1199.169 --> 1203.5490000000002
can effectively shut off and it's cut

1201.929 --> 1206.669
not so easy as you may think it's not

1203.549 --> 1209.25
just it's all a lie no no no it's much

1206.669 --> 1211.44
more complicated there is a reality we

1209.25 --> 1213.929
have to deal with and it's not super

1211.44 --> 1216.3890000000001
easy you've really got to be sharp let's

1213.929 --> 1220.5900000000001
do the reality and then you'll be able

1216.389 --> 1223.6689999999999
to just swim through it without without

1220.59 --> 1226.799
so much as getting a scratch potentially

1223.669 --> 1228.8990000000001
if you get dragged into something if you

1226.799 --> 1231.59
get fooled then there's gonna be plenty

1228.899 --> 1231.59
of scratches

1242.219 --> 1247.269
yeah well baits are at 60 RMC I don't

1245.529 --> 1252.339
know I don't know what the hell is going

1247.269 --> 1257.529
on I don't really care too much it seems

1252.339 --> 1260.6789999999999
like he's just going full-on in on the

1257.529 --> 1263.44
fear porn sort of thing and in a way so

1260.679 --> 1266.6490000000001
does it Alex Jones have you ever noticed

1263.44 --> 1269.079
that well what that experience is pretty

1266.649 --> 1271.2689999999998
long now but yesterday there was a silly

1269.079 --> 1273.099
situation I didn't watch all of it

1271.269 --> 1275.589
although it did try to watch you to

1273.099 --> 1278.829
chunk because apparently David Icke got

1275.589 --> 1282.789
on and yeah David Icke Alex Jones that's

1278.829 --> 1285.639
classic you know they Alex got got David

1282.789 --> 1287.799
Icke on the show like pretty early on

1285.639 --> 1289.779
and was very interesting the

1287.799 --> 1295.329
developments now

1289.779 --> 1302.349
alex has become I don't know he's

1295.329 --> 1302.889
different and David David Icke not so

1302.349 --> 1307.149
much

1302.889 --> 1308.769
he seems very much the same yes even

1307.149 --> 1310.4189999999999
more energies like more certain about

1308.769 --> 1313.419
everything he's done and he's also

1310.419 --> 1315.279
cleared up some surreal elements made

1313.419 --> 1317.1390000000001
making them more concrete it's almost

1315.279 --> 1320.079
like he had his own dark world fish and

1317.139 --> 1322.9889999999998
type thing to deal with and he's also

1320.079 --> 1325.389
cleared up some details about it got

1322.989 --> 1327.429
more conclusions more sense out of it

1325.389 --> 1330.519
that's what it feels like these always

1327.429 --> 1332.529
felt like that to me for time he tries

1330.519 --> 1337.119
to describe ethereal things it just

1332.529 --> 1339.94
feels reminds me a lot but yeah

1337.119 --> 1344.349
something typical stuff happen again

1339.94 --> 1346.8990000000001
because they were talking about corona

1344.349 --> 1349.059
situation in the mind control oh thank

1346.899 --> 1349.599
you Giulio Pepin thank you for the $10

1349.059 --> 1351.459
ship which I did

1349.599 --> 1356.259
oh I completely forgot Amanda Young's

1351.459 --> 1358.209
PayPal ah sorry I'm gonna check it but

1356.259 --> 1361.059
as I talk about this issue

1358.209 --> 1364.659
yeah Alex Jones had him David icon and

1361.059 --> 1366.759
David Icke was really it was so typical

1364.659 --> 1368.5590000000002
because imagine like there's two

1366.759 --> 1370.779
narratives playing off simultaneously

1368.559 --> 1372.11
like neighbors so David Icke would be

1370.779 --> 1375.98
saying yeah this is

1372.11 --> 1377.8999999999999
about fear and gotta just realize it's

1375.98 --> 1380.45
an illusion it's very sensible stuff

1377.9 --> 1382.88
it's like David I kind of gets it and

1380.45 --> 1385.3700000000001
then Alex Jones would be yeah yeah but

1382.88 --> 1387.5300000000002
that's an alien invasion and yeah the

1385.37 --> 1389.059
mind crud is actually like you do the

1387.53 --> 1391.34
aliens are fading through the other

1389.059 --> 1393.799
dimensions like that level of height

1391.34 --> 1395.1789999999999
fear porn and you would like insert that

1393.799 --> 1397.61
[ __ ] like really quickly you mean you

1395.179 --> 1400.1200000000001
put it's like they've like perfectly

1397.61 --> 1403.1899999999998
smooth and commented but you've got a

1400.12 --> 1406.04
fear the alien invasion they're not

1403.19 --> 1408.3500000000001
human and another day fragment yeah yeah

1406.04 --> 1414.3799999999999
but continue again with the smooth it

1408.35 --> 1415.9099999999999
was so silly to see that and that kind

1414.38 --> 1417.71
of thing has happened before between

1415.91 --> 1421.5400000000002
them because alyc jaws always kind of

1417.71 --> 1425.3600000000001
fear hype hype ich and David Icke is

1421.54 --> 1427.49
much more of a calm down and just think

1425.36 --> 1433.1
about it carefully

1427.49 --> 1435.38
sorry person and yeah it doesn't really

1433.1 --> 1438.559
mix well but they try and it just gets

1435.38 --> 1440.72
that weird result the first calm down

1438.559 --> 1443.84
calm down it that be afraid of the alien

1440.72 --> 1446.57
invasion and but calm down it's all

1443.84 --> 1451.73
about fear and just don't go along with

1446.57 --> 1455.09
it but you've got to be careful they're

1451.73 --> 1459.23
not human they're coming for all of us

1455.09 --> 1463.1299999999999
yeah I don't know I thought I guess I

1459.23 --> 1466.45
think that you know in a poetic way it

1463.13 --> 1466.45
is kind of amusing Oh

1469.73 --> 1472.39
Dean

1481.76 --> 1488.83
okay

1484.36 --> 1491.26

did change his name in the sense that he

1516.94 --> 1524.3200000000002
just took away the flat earth out of his

1519.43 --> 1526.9
name because he wants to hit the bigger

1524.32 --> 1530.83
platforms he wants to be the next Alex

1526.9 --> 1536.65
Jones he can hide fear porn - all day

1530.83 --> 1539.83
long I might push it this week and

1536.65 --> 1541.48
giving you a heads up you might push it

1539.83 --> 1543.34
what do you mean exactly

1541.48 --> 1547.17
Amanda young thank you for forgetting

but yeah I don't want you to get

1568.99 --> 1575.46
yourself in trouble okay

1570.57 --> 1575.46
probably be reminding you about that

1588.71 --> 1595.809
claimed he was missing chats at him

1591.529 --> 1595.809
because too much for a chat it is what

1596.35 --> 1601.75
hmm yeah there's all kinds of weird

1599.289 --> 1602.95
things happening with her Auntie and the

1601.75 --> 1606.37
I think he likes it

1602.95 --> 1608.71
oh I'm Anna young right

1606.37 --> 1613.09
two hours again this weekend yeah well

1608.71 --> 1620.53
why not you know there's a lot of things

1613.09 --> 1622.75
to do in the afternoon it's not like I'm

1620.53 --> 1626.53
gonna be playing D&D or something you

1622.75 --> 1630.309
know cuz they're all mad and when one of

1626.53 --> 1633.039
my players is afraid the Caronia so he's

1630.309 --> 1645.1499999999999
not gonna do go anywhere until after

1633.039 --> 1649.57
June 1st we brilliant George Sanford

1645.15 --> 1651.64
that yeah I get where you're going

1649.57 --> 1654.22
look I've been saying that at the start

1651.64 --> 1659.289
of this it's like the corona situation

1654.22 --> 1662.32
right now seems to be false but who

1659.289 --> 1665.73
knows at some point there might be a all

1662.32 --> 1670.51
of a sudden bang everybody is hit by

1665.73 --> 1673.15
like a shock wave and an energy spike or

1670.51 --> 1676.15
whatever that causes everybody's

1673.15 --> 1678.94
Constitution to just drop to zero or

1676.15 --> 1681.76
something and and that people could

1678.94 --> 1683.95
spontaneously become very sick and maybe

1681.76 --> 1687.6
like almost everyone in the world I

1683.95 --> 1687.6000000000001
don't know I don't know man

1688.26 --> 1696.25
although yeah these days comparing it to

1691.75 --> 1701.08
the Spanish flu in the what is in 1918

1696.25 --> 1704.26
not a T as I thought we're starting out

1701.08 --> 1706.51
this in these conversations but 1918

1704.26 --> 1709.48
while there's even signs that those may

1706.51 --> 1716.74
have also been part of a biological

1709.48 --> 1722.89
weapon release through vaccines so yeah

1716.74 --> 1727.83
if I think there's a good chance in some

1722.89 --> 1733.1490000000001
way no not a guarantee but a good chance

1727.83 --> 1737.5
that it may just turn out that these

1733.149 --> 1739.6299999999999
supposed vaccines for the corona that

1737.5 --> 1743.77
are being worked on that they will

1739.63 --> 1750.24
induce very much a Spanish flu like

1743.77 --> 1753.85
plague and kill off a lot of people and

1750.24 --> 1757.059
I don't know you don't know how far this

1753.85 --> 1759.51
could be pushed you know who exactly is

1757.059 --> 1764.23
in control of that plan who's like

1759.51 --> 1766.27
responsible for that side and who knows

1764.23 --> 1768.25
maybe if they can't spread enough

1766.27 --> 1770.559
vaccines they will try to force it on

1768.25 --> 1774.94
people or even like sneak vaccine people

1770.559 --> 1776.44
you horrible stuff or if it just it's

1774.94 --> 1779.8600000000001
like not gonna work then they'll just

1776.44 --> 1781.929
freakin spray it on everything just

1779.86 --> 1783.8799999999999
spray it on everything and then it's not

1781.929 --> 1786.7
just humans it's gonna be everything all

1783.88 --> 1789.46
animals and it will be like a hell on

1786.7 --> 1792.07
earth certainly you know I don't know

1789.46 --> 1793.3600000000001
how this is all very do --mush when you

1792.07 --> 1796.029
when I say it like that

1793.36 --> 1799.8899999999999
you don't know how far it can go I don't

1796.029 --> 1803.649
know how far it can go or allow to go or

1799.89 --> 1812.38
obligate it to go you know which one elf

1803.649 --> 1814.6589999999999
is is it do they want to or do they do

1812.38 --> 1818.169
they feel they have to or are they

1814.659 --> 1822.1000000000001
literally like no you must do this or

1818.169 --> 1825.3090000000002
here are terrible consequences that they

1822.1 --> 1829.809
know about for them like you don't know

1825.309 --> 1832.32
though no but there's a good chance that

1829.809 --> 1834.94
once some kind of vaccine is gonna be

1832.32 --> 1837.73
entering the market for supposed Corona

1834.94 --> 1842.6490000000001
response that that is going to be the

1837.73 --> 1845.529
big the big biological attack as it were

1842.649 --> 1847.9899999999998
that's gonna come from that that's what

1845.529 --> 1850.179
I predict it's almost not even a

1847.99 --> 1853.45
prediction anymore because I'll bet

1850.179 --> 1855.999
there's a hundred or maybe thousands of

1853.45 --> 1859.539
other people that have already concluded

1855.999 --> 1864.159
this because it is so straightforward it

1859.539 --> 1867.519
is so basic as I said this whole thing

1864.159 --> 1870.46
you really got to be literally brain

1867.519 --> 1872.129
dead not to realize what the [ __ ] is

1870.46 --> 1874.749
going on right now in the world

1872.129 --> 1877.33
with everything they do if you don't

1874.749 --> 1882.669
figure it out yeah you deserve

1877.33 --> 1883.389
everything that will come to you right

1882.669 --> 1887.019
deserve

1883.389 --> 1890.4989999999998
it'll technically be your fault because

1887.019 --> 1898.539
you can't get any more clear with the

1890.499 --> 1900.759
signs and the knowledge so now will that

1898.539 --> 1903.399
mean that literally suddenly the entire

1900.759 --> 1907.21
world will be struck by this by this

1903.399 --> 1910.889
massive disease thing I don't know could

1907.21 --> 1913.6000000000001
be could be specifically designated to

1910.889 --> 1916.57
the people that went too far and took

1913.6 --> 1918.73
that vaccine and they will just go

1916.57 --> 1923.47
through that I don't know for sure I

1918.73 --> 1928.259
don't know it could be one thing that I

1923.47 --> 1928.259
can pretty much guarantee though is that

1929.909 --> 1934.8690000000001
what they will think what the vaccine

1932.71 --> 1937.48
takers will think through a

1934.869 --> 1939.549
preponderance of information and

1937.48 --> 1941.169
delusions about that information and

1939.549 --> 1943.029
presuppositions that they've been fed

1941.169 --> 1944.3500000000001
all their life and they've called it all

1943.029 --> 1946.929
up and they've made it them they've

1944.35 --> 1949.4189999999999
become the mistake that they made right

1946.929 --> 1951.6390000000001
remember that first you make a mistake

1949.419 --> 1956.2
then when you don't overcome the mistake

1951.639 --> 1959.08
then you become the mistake and then the

1956.2 --> 1961.72
mistake becomes you oh that's what this

1959.08 --> 1965.019
could be because those vaccine takers

1961.72 --> 1966.97
they will probably think like oh yeah

1965.019 --> 1969.369
because I take the vaccine that means I

1966.97 --> 1971.59
can get it but all those people out

1969.369 --> 1975.24
there haha they're all fools they're

1971.59 --> 1978.4499999999998
gonna they're gonna get it you know that

1975.24 --> 1981.789
something that I can almost guarantee is

1978.45 --> 1983.19
absolutely a hundred percent false it

1981.789 --> 1986.31
will never

1983.19 --> 1988.6200000000001
transpire exactly like that you know I

1986.31 --> 1990.4199999999998
can't guarantee that nobody that doesn't

1988.62 --> 1993.81
take a vaccine will not kind of get it

1990.42 --> 1995.3100000000002
in some way whatever it is gonna be this

1993.81 --> 1999.5
supposed to plague that will be

1995.31 --> 2002.21
unleashed at the time of vaccines or

1999.5 --> 2005.54
that's literally just not true and it's

2002.21 --> 2013.22
just the vaccine takers it could be as

2005.54 --> 2019.37
simple as that it's C I don't know

2013.22 --> 2021.2
I feel kind of stumbling around at this

2019.37 --> 2023.4799999999998
point with all of this because at one

2021.2 --> 2028.3700000000001
point these things are so brutally

2023.48 --> 2031.07
blatantly obvious on the other hand that

2028.37 --> 2034.54
on the long run doesn't seem to make

2031.07 --> 2042.62
things a lot clearer as to what is

2034.54 --> 2044.48
absolutely gonna happen for sure you

2042.62 --> 2046.34
guys got some buffering problems I don't

2044.48 --> 2048.62
seem to be having any buffering problems

2046.34 --> 2050.77
I'm following my own YouTube stream and

2048.62 --> 2053.15
it hasn't interrupted even a single time

2050.77 --> 2059.54
so that might be your internet

2053.15 --> 2062.09
connection yes Karen B I know that's why

2059.54 --> 2063.05
I'm not people who get vaccines yet

2062.09 --> 2066.53
that's right

2063.05 --> 2070.2200000000003
they literally become the spreaders but

2066.53 --> 2075.6200000000003
most of the time but that's not a

2070.22 --> 2078.6499999999996
guarantee that it's not even a guarantee

2075.62 --> 2083.45
that what what is going to be put in the

2078.65 --> 2085.34
vaccines is actually a disease never

2083.45 --> 2088.3999999999996
thought about maybe it's just not even a

2085.34 --> 2093.9700000000003
disease maybe it's more like an implant

2088.4 --> 2096.62
or something that just causes that

2093.97 --> 2099.68
something like that you don't even know

2096.62 --> 2101.18
if it is going to be a disease that's

2099.68 --> 2104.06
going to be part of the vaccine just

2101.18 --> 2105.95
because they say it is and poison of

2104.06 --> 2108.19
course poison is probably going to be

2105.95 --> 2108.1899999999996
there

2111.44 --> 2117.4500000000003
but it's not just it's not just like

2114.15 --> 2121.4
inject you with poison follow that the

2117.45 --> 2121.3999999999996
mouth and you die no that's no that's

2121.789 --> 2127.38
definitely not gonna happen you know

2125.579 --> 2129.9300000000003
when that kind of situation arises

2127.38 --> 2132.4500000000003
that's when absolute Civil War breaks

2129.93 --> 2135.029
out and people literally start getting

2132.45 --> 2137.5789999999997
injected and then dying once people

2135.029 --> 2142.38
catch on to that it's gonna be freakin

2137.579 --> 2145.52
Civil War big-time so that's definitely

2142.38 --> 2148.589
not gonna happen that would be insane

2145.52 --> 2151.92
you know why why would they do that it's

2148.589 --> 2153.99
just you know it's easier to then just

2151.92 --> 2155.4300000000003
for no good reason mark anybody is a

2153.99 --> 2157.8289999999997
terrorist and then shooting or something

2155.43 --> 2160.74
for government so that's just never

2157.829 --> 2162.6600000000003
gonna happen like that unless they

2160.74 --> 2165.359
specifically want to induce some kind of

2162.66 --> 2167.1299999999997
horror and then if they think they can

2165.359 --> 2169.2599999999998
control it but if it's like kinda just

2167.13 --> 2175.859
they're just gonna put lethal injections

2169.26 --> 2179.5490000000004
in people in public yeah it's gonna and

2175.859 --> 2185.25
very aggressively once people catch on

2179.549 --> 2186.93
to that so I don't think that but hey if

2185.25 --> 2189.329
they're gonna get some vaccines supposed

2186.93 --> 2192.5989999999997
to live for the corona yeah who says

2189.329 --> 2196.6800000000003
there is even a disease or whatever in

2192.599 --> 2198.809
that vaccine why are you assuming there

2196.68 --> 2203.0099999999998
would be anything related to that in

2198.809 --> 2206.119
there at all don't you think it could be

2203.01 --> 2206.119
something else instead

2225.89 --> 2231.31
crazy state what are you talking about a

2228.86 --> 2231.31
gym

2243.96 --> 2248.78
could just as likely be in the test kits

2248.839 --> 2257.04
I don't know man

2253.82 --> 2259.23
well this supposed mechanism to suit to

2257.04 --> 2261.69
check samples right it's supposed to go

2259.23 --> 2265.07
into your nose cavity and that is like

2261.69 --> 2265.07
creepy to me

2266.75 --> 2271.43
the guide it's no thanks

2279.62 --> 2284.17
that I don't know what that means AGM

2313.42 --> 2320.859
so you mean spelling yeah well next time

2317.079 --> 2323.9500000000003
before you click enter maybe look what

2320.859 --> 2329.049
you're writing there correct it before

2323.95 --> 2331.299
you hit Enter you know nobody's in a

2329.049 --> 2333.309
hurry it's like it's not like it's life

2331.299 --> 2336.25
or death situation that you put it down

2333.309 --> 2338.4700000000003
immediately you know you can take a few

2336.25 --> 2342.299
extra seconds and just look at what you

2338.47 --> 2342.299
wrote and see if you got it right

2344.9 --> 2348.01
[Music]

2367.44 --> 2373.16
mmm-hmm what are you talking about over

2370.77 --> 2373.16
Mukul

2378.53 --> 2389.3300000000004
oh it's a movie great state hmm I is it

2387.23 --> 2391.19
now I haven't heard of it

2389.33 --> 2393.31
or well the name sounds kind of familiar

2391.19 --> 2395.57
but I'm pretty sure I haven't seen it

2393.31 --> 2398.7799999999997
might be because it's like the

2395.57 --> 2401.48
thousandth of this topic future type

2398.78 --> 2404.65
thing you know after some point I got

2401.48 --> 2408.31
kind of sick of it all it's like yeah I

2404.65 --> 2410.78
[ __ ] know there's a million ways

2408.31 --> 2414.02
controllers have figured out how to

2410.78 --> 2416.51
[ __ ] destroy the world in some

2414.02 --> 2420.43
idiotic attempt to keep everything under

2416.51 --> 2423.5600000000004
control yeah I know thousands of ways

2420.43 --> 2429.0499999999997
well I prefer to focus on like how to

2423.56 --> 2431.86
actually not go there it's not a lot of

2429.05 --> 2431.86
movies about that

2446.95 --> 2449.64
what

2450.85 --> 2458.31
killed Crowley and his family for

2454.66 --> 2460.99
release what what are you talking about

2458.31 --> 2465.07
are you saying it's like a movie from

2460.99 --> 2467.7999999999997
the 60s or something that I'm getting a

2465.07 --> 2471.15
little mixed up maybe here this is still

2467.8 --> 2471.15
about that gray state movie

2492.72 --> 2498.1499999999996
all right so okay I guess since

2495.81 --> 2500.79
everybody's now talking about it and I'm

2498.15 --> 2503.1800000000003
gonna be forced to freaking watch it you

2500.79 --> 2506.369
know I'm gonna be forced to watch every

2503.18 --> 2508.319
[ __ ] paranoid piece of [ __ ] dystopic

2506.369 --> 2511.38
movie ever made in the whole [ __ ]

2508.319 --> 2514.17
world because everybody can't help but

2511.38 --> 2515.849
just get obsessed over it nobody wants

2514.17 --> 2518.73
to even think of peace now they want

2515.849 --> 2520.23
everything to be [ __ ] trashed cuz

2518.73 --> 2522.599
they're all obsessed over it

2520.23 --> 2525.81
you can't let it go you can't let it go

2522.599 --> 2529.579
no because the world would be too

2525.81 --> 2532.41
[ __ ] boring without it wouldn't it

2529.579 --> 2536.52
you can't do without hell can't you

2532.41 --> 2539.8689999999997
human beings you can't do it you can't

2536.52 --> 2539.869
live without it can't you

2550.08 --> 2565.69
2018 2017 okay mm yeah I completely

2561.79 --> 2572.89
missed out on it so yeah I can safely

2565.69 --> 2575.5
say that David oh wait and what is David

2572.89 --> 2578.37
I thought you what is named Crowley

2575.5 --> 2578.37
weird

2584.549 --> 2591.309
okay I got an 8 I thought you were

2586.749 --> 2593.259
technoboy King Crowley Aleister Crowley

2591.309 --> 2595.7490000000003
okay this guy is apparently called

2593.259 --> 2598.589
Crowley and he was killed over this

2595.749 --> 2598.589
movie okay

2628.41 --> 2635.569
okay yeah it does look exactly like a

2631.17 --> 2635.569
typical police-state thing

2677.7 --> 2680.4199999999996
all right

2681.27 --> 2683.99
so

2686.25 --> 2692.4
I don't know it just I'm not really in

2690.99 --> 2695.3399999999997
the mood for this kind of thing right

2692.4 --> 2697.71
now so my response is gonna be okay

2695.34 --> 2699.84
watching that entire movie you guys have

2697.71 --> 2702.87
watched it right and so it's so good oh

2699.84 --> 2708.3
he died for it so watching that entire

2702.87 --> 2715.71
movie what did you you personally learn

2708.3 --> 2720.17
from that movie that you will apply to

2715.71 --> 2726.69
your near future life think about it

2720.17 --> 2729.66
very carefully what of that movie was

2726.69 --> 2732.87
actually valuable for you in a sense

2729.66 --> 2741.6299999999997
that there was something you could get

2732.87 --> 2744.24
out of it practically for you to do gray

2741.63 --> 2745.62
State I'm talking about grace everybody

2744.24 --> 2750.62
seemed to be talking about the movie

2745.62 --> 2755.45
great state here and then the you

2750.62 --> 2761.06
survival oh really so you learn survival

2755.45 --> 2761.06
you know what is that really

2765.819 --> 2776.65
it's actually a documentary yeah now I'm

2772.42 --> 2779.259
just saying I mean is it just a typical

2776.65 --> 2780.789
warning like hey there is there is

2779.259 --> 2782.41
something going on the police state

2780.789 --> 2783.7290000000003
crackdown they're gonna fool you there

2782.41 --> 2786.43
can you do it like this they're gonna do

2783.729 --> 2789.009
it like that well it's there it's that

2786.43 --> 2790.839
new even you know do you even have to

2789.009 --> 2792.219
watch your new movie to realize that

2790.839 --> 2797.619
that's gonna go down one way or the

2792.219 --> 2799.799
other but what are you gonna get out of

2797.619 --> 2799.799
it

2817.5 --> 2829.47
okay well look I'm not even unwilling to

2822.359 --> 2834.72
watch it I'm just I'm just being very

2829.47 --> 2838.74
stubborn and very contradictive like I

2834.72 --> 2840.18
know this is going down now right yeah

2838.74 --> 2844.0989999999997
there is a freaking police state

2840.18 --> 2849.48
crackdown worldwide it's gonna come and

2844.099 --> 2852.1800000000003
I hate I hate that it's coming out of my

2849.48 --> 2858.119
mouth right now I hate it I don't even

2852.18 --> 2863.0899999999997

2874.98 --> 2881.76
my attention anymore it's just I hate it

2877.26 --> 2883.9500000000003
and therefore I not really that

2881.76 --> 2887.369
enthusiastic like oh yeah yeah I should

2883.95 --> 2890.16
definitely watch like 20 police state

2887.369 --> 2894.33
movies because I gotta be completely in

2890.16 --> 2896.91
the I got a no every option ever and all

2894.33 --> 2899.0989999999997
the terror you can imagine ever that

2896.91 --> 2901.08
could come out of this right now because

2899.099 --> 2903.1800000000003
everybody's interested in it right

2901.08 --> 2905.339

2903.18 --> 2908.339
right so I gotta watch all those [ __ ]

2905.339 --> 2910.02
movies about police state paranoia and

2908.339 --> 2911.79

2958.98 --> 2962.549
movies made in the last 50 years about

2961.44 --> 2966.5
that [ __ ]

2962.549 --> 2966.5
I just wanted to piss off

2975.96 --> 2979.039
[Music]

2996.31 --> 3004.349
for you and if this is the time of the

3001.68 --> 3007.95
month then it's more like the time of

3004.349 --> 3010.71
every two or three days because two days

3007.95 --> 3014.04
ago I was also incredibly pissed off I

3010.71 --> 3016.619

day long is that a possibility really

3098.99 --> 3103.16

3105.82 --> 3111.8
although sometimes I just think it's not

3108.59 --> 3116.2400000000002
anymore because every freaking person in

3111.8 --> 3118.82
the world is obsessed with this [ __ ]

3180.56 --> 3187.37
going around right now making everybody

3183.23 --> 3189.77
freaking obsessed with virus fear porn

3187.37 --> 3193.3399999999997
police state crackdown [ __ ]

3193.34 --> 3202.31
beyond sick so most literally my

3199.13 --> 3204.94
agitation is giving me headaches at

3202.31 --> 3204.94
times

3209.19 --> 3214.76
so yeah that's been kind of bothering me

3211.57 --> 3217.909
last month and it's getting worse

3214.76 --> 3217.909
[Music]

3220.89 --> 3226.69
does not mean do not appreciate people

3224.589 --> 3238.93
bringing up information like your gray

3226.69 --> 3241.859
state movie and it's just I wish there

3238.93 --> 3241.859
was something else

3257.77 --> 3260.55
hmm

3266.89 --> 3272.44
yeah angry elf yeah you got your silly

3270.07 --> 3274.6000000000004
nail little Arwen clip oh you got your

3272.44 --> 3277.0
new little are windcliff all the trolls

3274.6 --> 3281.1
out there oh now they can you have this

3277.0 --> 3285.13
little moment this little moment that

3281.1 --> 3288.13
gives them something to desperately hold

3285.13 --> 3290.98
on to in some way to help them convince

3288.13 --> 3292.57
themselves that the depth that I reach

3290.98 --> 3294.64
with everything I talk about in the

3292.57 --> 3296.4700000000003
level of conclusion and just the overall

3294.64 --> 3299.41
consciousness that I carry that it may

3296.47 --> 3301.9599999999996
actually be just craziness because I

3299.41 --> 3304.96
don't know who could how could a sane

3301.96 --> 3307.96
person that knows what he's doing do so

3304.96 --> 3310.51
crazy you know it helps them it helps

3307.96 --> 3313.2
it's like a vaccination of the brain

3310.51 --> 3316.21
it's like oh wow he did something silly

3313.2 --> 3318.1299999999997
let's just think about that and laugh

3316.21 --> 3320.11
about that for as much as much as

3318.13 --> 3323.02
possible and help ourselves to

3320.11 --> 3324.7000000000003
indoctrinate ourselves with it that well

3323.02 --> 3326.59
because of that everything he said is

3324.7 --> 3328.62
just pretty much useless and because

3326.59 --> 3336.9700000000003
yeah it's just a flat earth and he does

3328.62 --> 3339.46
yeah yeah yeah oh you know what just

3336.97 --> 3344.5
because of that I it's not enough reason

3339.46 --> 3346.84
for me to hold back anymore because the

3344.5 --> 3350.44
way that this [ __ ] the frustration

3346.84 --> 3355.53
presses from the inside I have to get

3350.44 --> 3358.15
crazy over this [ __ ] I have to I have to

3355.53 --> 3360.76
throw it out in some way cuz otherwise

3358.15 --> 3363.76
it's just gonna end up like trashing

3360.76 --> 3366.2700000000004
something because it's really

3363.76 --> 3366.2700000000004
frustrating

3374.37 --> 3387.3399999999997
it is what it is ah I see I finally got

3384.28 --> 3389.2000000000003
the regular down votes again because I

3387.34 --> 3391.0
was wondering like wow is there some

3389.2 --> 3393.7599999999998
youtube crackdown in the last two days

3391.0 --> 3397.48
there were like no down votes at the

3393.76 --> 3401.6400000000003
start at least it seems that back to

3397.48 --> 3401.64
normal like that I guess that the trolls

3402.75 --> 3409.32
got calm enough to go back behind their

3406.42 --> 3421.29
keyboards and waste all their times

3409.32 --> 3421.29
tagging people they don't like does that

3421.65 --> 3424.279
in

3430.75 --> 3433.75
yeah

3436.7 --> 3439.359
yeah

3439.51 --> 3444.28
yeah Paul Roberts you do that and I

3442.36 --> 3447.1600000000003
listen to a lot of them too and there's

3444.28 --> 3458.19
all kinds of directions you can take it

3447.16 --> 3461.83
at go out and get a tan are you joking

3458.19 --> 3465.76
me getting a tan even in spring Sun

3461.83 --> 3468.34
there's no way that's gonna happen now I

3465.76 --> 3471.55
only really start to get color in the

3468.34 --> 3475.9300000000003
month of May before that time the sun's

3471.55 --> 3478.3900000000003
just not strong enough but you have

3475.93 --> 3484.12
unless the weather gets even more

3478.39 --> 3485.8599999999997
beautiful than this but I don't know you

3491.68 --> 3498.1299999999997
spot and yeah I got the roof to catch

3494.59 --> 3500.05

3504.76 --> 3511.1800000000003
minimum yeah this is cuz it's freaking

3507.25 --> 3513.07
cold so that's not yeah especially right

3511.18 --> 3515.3399999999997

to do

3524.11 --> 3530.77
Jesus Christ hmm god damn it man
