turret 306

182.319 --> 185.83999999999997
so how are you guys all doing

186.0 --> 190.239
i was just watching owen benjamin

190.8 --> 195.44
from yesterday and it's hilarious

197.519 --> 201.12
he's like

198.8 --> 203.92000000000002
in that show he's totally going after

201.12 --> 205.519
nathan thompson who just gamma out

203.92 --> 208.07999999999998
against him

205.519 --> 209.36
over veganism

208.08 --> 210.799
and like

209.36 --> 215.04000000000002
dude

210.799 --> 218.4
owen benjamin went after him a heart

215.04 --> 220.56
but it is hilarious and i i totally

218.4 --> 221.59900000000002
agree

220.56 --> 223.68
like

221.599 --> 225.44
i i've tried to be a little bit more

223.68 --> 229.20000000000002
mild about it

225.44 --> 229.2
saying just like yeah he's just

230.64 --> 236.95899999999997
he has savonia complex

233.04 --> 236.959
and he kind of knows it but

238.08 --> 241.92000000000002
right has it been like mean to me or

240.56 --> 244.08
anything so

241.92 --> 245.439
i don't have a reason to like go after

244.08 --> 247.68
him

245.439 --> 249.599
but apparently owen benjamin triggered

247.68 --> 251.92000000000002
him at some point

249.599 --> 255.76
so he went after him hard

251.92 --> 257.919
and it was really funny

255.76 --> 260.88
anyway

257.919 --> 263.19899999999996
little gadget inspector

260.88 --> 267.12
you vegetarian

263.199 --> 267.12
is it wrong to eat meat no it's not

267.6 --> 274.47900000000004
no and i am not a vegetarian

270.88 --> 278.0
sometimes i'm a little vegetarian

274.479 --> 278.0
i kind of leave it to my body

279.04 --> 282.40000000000003
like

279.84 --> 283.44
two years ago i was vegetarian for a

282.4 --> 286.08
year

283.44 --> 288.96
and then my body because in that time my

286.08 --> 290.96
body was like eh no i don't need meat

288.96 --> 293.03999999999996
you don't want it it didn't even

290.96 --> 293.75899999999996
appreciate the smell of it

293.04 --> 295.68
so

293.759 --> 296.47900000000004
before that before i started that it

295.68 --> 300.40000000000003
almost

296.479 --> 302.479
like i would just have meat in my diet

300.4 --> 303.84
but then i started to notice i had

302.479 --> 306.32
like

303.84 --> 309.52
didn't want it

306.32 --> 311.68
like it didn't do it for me so i just

309.52 --> 314.08
decided okay i'm gonna be vegetarian and

311.68 --> 316.24
that worked great but then after a year

314.08 --> 318.08
suddenly the impulses came back my body

316.24 --> 319.919
was like okay

318.08 --> 322.0
that was good now

319.919 --> 323.19899999999996
we need it back

322.0 --> 325.84
so i just

323.199 --> 327.91900000000004
yeah return to the

325.84 --> 329.919
normal diet setup

327.919 --> 332.08
but even these days

329.919 --> 336.08
i don't even eat meat every day i don't

332.08 --> 336.08
specifically exclude it like oh

336.4 --> 340.88
every four days i

338.8 --> 342.40000000000003
eat meat and the rest i'm

340.88 --> 344.71999999999997
vegetarian

342.4 --> 346.96
because that's important

344.72 --> 349.6
no it's just like my body

346.96 --> 349.59999999999997
like yeah

350.4 --> 355.35999999999996
you don't need it today and then you'll

353.12 --> 357.919
be perfectly fine

355.36 --> 360.96000000000004
and then another day i do eat it and i'm

357.919 --> 360.96
still perfectly fine

363.68 --> 366.68
anyway

369.6 --> 374.88
try indian vegetarian dishes

372.8 --> 376.56
you'll love it yeah

374.88 --> 378.84
i've had even like

376.56 --> 382.56
indian vegan or

378.84 --> 384.96
ayurvedic dishes and that was great too

382.56 --> 387.44
for a while

384.96 --> 390.71999999999997
like there was a festival i used to go

387.44 --> 392.56
at wave gothic traffic

390.72 --> 393.44000000000005
and they had

392.56 --> 396.16
well

393.44 --> 399.52
ayurvedic food stand

396.16 --> 402.08000000000004
from like one guy or like one yeah who

399.52 --> 403.68
kept doing that every time there so you

402.08 --> 404.8
like eventually if you came back enough

403.68 --> 406.56
you'd start

404.8 --> 409.84000000000003
recognizing him

406.56 --> 411.039
and i would like almost every day eat

409.84 --> 413.28
there

411.039 --> 415.199
for half a week or longer

413.28 --> 417.599
because it was the only food that

415.199 --> 420.72
actually felt good like other food was

417.599 --> 425.039
just like standard festival

420.72 --> 427.52000000000004
sausages and all that non-organic and uh

425.039 --> 428.88
no no thanks

427.52 --> 431.599
so i just

428.88 --> 433.199
ate the ayurvedic food

431.599 --> 435.52
and they had like different types of

433.199 --> 439.199
meals that you could choose from and

435.52 --> 441.44
it was great and it was cheap too

439.199 --> 443.28000000000003
so that worked great

441.44 --> 445.919
but i wouldn't want to eat that every

443.28 --> 445.919
single day

446.96 --> 449.96
anyway

452.16 --> 457.28000000000003
the voice thoughts hilarious

455.199 --> 459.44
yeah i'm doing it in the shadow of owen

457.28 --> 462.4
benjamin because he does that a lot i

459.44 --> 464.639
really don't like doing like it well

462.4 --> 466.31899999999996
the sort of a gay voice i really don't

464.639 --> 468.40000000000003
like it

466.319 --> 470.24
but in this case i i thought i'd make a

468.4 --> 473.52
point

470.24 --> 475.84000000000003
with that in reflection of

473.52 --> 477.68
own benjamin he was basically doing that

475.84 --> 479.84
constantly right before i started the

477.68 --> 482.639
show so it

479.84 --> 482.63899999999995
slipped in there

490.319 --> 494.96000000000004
regular north indian dishes sorry tara

493.039 --> 497.919
no i don't really know

494.96 --> 502.15999999999997
indian cuisine all that well

497.919 --> 502.15999999999997
i think uh like even when i was younger

503.039 --> 507.199
my family

504.879 --> 510.639
was pretty good at cooking

507.199 --> 513.839
my dad's great they tried it sometime

510.639 --> 516.32
but like the tastes

513.839 --> 518.839
are like so different

516.32 --> 520.479
with the spices you know i i didn't like

518.839 --> 522.6400000000001
it

520.479 --> 523.6800000000001
i didn't like the the combination of

522.64 --> 526.16
tastes

523.68 --> 528.8
their herbs and all that

526.16 --> 528.8
i just like

529.6 --> 532.8000000000001
this thing's missing

532.88 --> 537.8389999999999
i don't know

535.6 --> 540.399
not saying it's bad or anything i just

537.839 --> 540.399
personally

541.68 --> 546.64
i like the way that i

543.68 --> 548.399
cook i i i'm much more of a fan of like

546.64 --> 551.36
mediterranean

548.399 --> 554.24
like just throw the herbs at it

551.36 --> 554.24
big tasty

554.56 --> 557.1999999999999
spicy

557.92 --> 561.88
that's what i really like

569.12 --> 573.12
like have some food in between your

571.04 --> 574.7199999999999
spices

573.12 --> 577.76
that's how i like it

574.72 --> 579.9200000000001
like i'm never shy with the salt or the

577.76 --> 582.16
pepper

579.92 --> 584.4799999999999
all that

582.16 --> 584.48
anyway

588.56 --> 593.8389999999999
nice hot curry

590.399 --> 595.92
nice hot curry is dangerous

593.839 --> 598.399
well if you're not indian i mean if

595.92 --> 600.0799999999999
you're literally raised on that [ __ ]

598.399 --> 602.24
yeah you can handle that if you're not

600.08 --> 605.839
used to that you're gonna be

602.24 --> 605.839
having some diarrhea

606.72 --> 609.2
at first

609.6 --> 616.12
because your intestines are going to be

611.6 --> 616.12
like what the hell is all this

628.48 --> 633.6800000000001
so many ways to cook them too yeah well

631.68 --> 637.92
not surprised territ

633.68 --> 637.92
india is a very big country with

639.68 --> 642.8
a variety of

641.6 --> 647.839
tribes

642.8 --> 647.8389999999999
and tastes so yeah i'm not surprised

656.16 --> 660.1999999999999
hello slow mo moon buggy

675.36 --> 678.88
nice hot curry makes you want to make

677.2 --> 680.8000000000001
love what

678.88 --> 684.079
okay

680.8 --> 686.64
well maybe if you're with a lady

684.079 --> 689.04
eating it together i guess yeah i don't

686.64 --> 690.959
know a lot of like good food makes me

689.04 --> 694.079
want to do that

690.959 --> 694.079
it was kind of like a

695.839 --> 699.0400000000001
way to pick up chicks

697.92 --> 701.519
like hey

699.04 --> 705.36
wanna come out for dinner

701.519 --> 708.0
and then actually give them a really

705.36 --> 710.64
high quality organic meal and they'll be

708.0 --> 710.64
like whoa

711.6 --> 716.639
like some girls would be like that's

714.32 --> 718.0790000000001
better cooking than i ever had in my

716.639 --> 720.32
youth

718.079 --> 722.2399999999999
you know yeah they

720.32 --> 723.9200000000001
women

722.24 --> 727.44
appreciate that

723.92 --> 727.4399999999999
they get very generous

727.839 --> 732.0
my ex was like that too because she

729.6 --> 733.36
couldn't cook for [ __ ]

732.0 --> 734.8
well

733.36 --> 737.12
not like

734.8 --> 739.279
it's just that

737.12 --> 742.72
she would typically if she was on her

739.279 --> 745.76
own always pick like a quick meal

742.72 --> 748.88
and she wasn't super good with spices

745.76 --> 751.519
so when i got in her life that time yeah

748.88 --> 754.16
she was like oh

751.519 --> 756.72
one that can cook

754.16 --> 759.8389999999999
and we're great

756.72 --> 759.839
for a while

760.32 --> 765.88
it's wrench wednesday yeah i guess so

782.0 --> 786.399
hello mike seduc

784.56 --> 788.4799999999999
wow there's a lot of people in chat here

786.399 --> 791.12
that's good

788.48 --> 791.12
that's great

799.36 --> 805.6800000000001
man i had such a good deep sleep this

803.44 --> 805.6800000000001
night

806.399 --> 811.04
ah like i'm fee i'm still feeling it's

808.959 --> 812.88
like half of me is still sleeping in

811.04 --> 813.5999999999999
that bed that's like how it feels it's

812.88 --> 815.8389999999999
like

813.6 --> 817.36
so relaxed that the muscles inside of me

815.839 --> 819.0400000000001
are still like

817.36 --> 820.5600000000001
yeah we're still gonna

819.04 --> 822.88
keep on

820.56 --> 823.8389999999999
like we're still gonna i know you're out

822.88 --> 829.0
of bed

823.839 --> 829.0
but we are still in bed imaginarily

829.12 --> 834.399
even though i'm going it was i had such

831.279 --> 834.399
a great sleep this night

834.88 --> 837.8389999999999
maybe that's something new with me

836.48 --> 841.12
taking

837.839 --> 843.839
some extra fish oil

841.12 --> 846.48
and of course not going to bed too late

843.839 --> 849.839
not taking that damned

846.48 --> 853.36
evening coffee which is really never too

849.839 --> 855.519
too good a new yeah too good a decision

853.36 --> 857.6
health-wise

855.519 --> 860.0
uh

857.6 --> 862.639
and the magnesium of course

860.0 --> 864.959
i i i just took an extra like an extra

862.639 --> 867.04
big shot of magnesium it it's all big

864.959 --> 870.16
bear's fault like he was talking on

867.04 --> 872.3199999999999
about that in yesterday's show

870.16 --> 874.24
apparently had he

872.32 --> 877.279
yeah had a really

874.24 --> 879.12
good source of liquid magnesium

877.279 --> 880.48
i don't know how that is but he

879.12 --> 884.399
apparently took a

880.48 --> 886.9590000000001
big shot of that and he was like

884.399 --> 890.72
enervated

886.959 --> 890.7199999999999
fluid super confident

893.36 --> 899.519
bought some liquid magnesium

896.48 --> 900.88
so what is that because i just have the

899.519 --> 903.44
powder

900.88 --> 905.92
and it works great for me too but i yeah

903.44 --> 907.2790000000001
the only liquid magnesium that i

905.92 --> 909.12
remember

907.279 --> 911.68
having been confronted with was like

909.12 --> 914.24
during my accident it was a spray bottle

911.68 --> 916.3199999999999
and you had to put it on your skin not

914.24 --> 918.72
not for

916.32 --> 921.44
for in your mouth because

918.72 --> 921.44
it yeah

922.399 --> 926.16
it wasn't meant for consumption like

924.639 --> 928.32
that

926.16 --> 928.3199999999999
so

931.759 --> 936.72
i don't know any like

934.079 --> 938.3199999999999
magnesium drinks like that i've never

936.72 --> 941.6800000000001
seen that before

938.32 --> 943.6800000000001
so what is in that what is it made of

941.68 --> 946.399
trace mineral brand

943.68 --> 946.399
magnesium

947.279 --> 952.4399999999999
now but what's the compound because this

954.399 --> 960.32
is magnesium citrate see magnesium

958.0 --> 962.399
citrate

960.32 --> 965.36
is it that too but in

962.399 --> 966.8
liquid form or like is it different but

965.36 --> 969.839
just in liquid

966.8 --> 969.8389999999999
what is it

981.279 --> 984.24
oh look who's here

988.48 --> 991.639
all right

1000.32 --> 1006.9590000000001
hmm

1002.72 --> 1008.88
right so now andrew boy is this another

1006.959 --> 1010.7199999999999
is this like johnny boy but now it's

1008.88 --> 1013.36
andrew what's with this boy and the

1010.72 --> 1016.32
gamma behavior

1013.36 --> 1018.88
but yeah why don't you

1016.32 --> 1021.1990000000001
transplant the word

1018.88 --> 1021.199
meat

1022.079 --> 1025.6
or

1022.839 --> 1026.959
like they don't even have to do that

1025.6 --> 1028.8799999999999
what if you're just

1026.959 --> 1029.8390000000002
talking about plants

1028.88 --> 1032.4
right

1029.839 --> 1035.28
i believe plants are actually sentient

1032.4 --> 1037.3600000000001
to a certain degree that is they're not

1035.28 --> 1040.3999999999999
sentient to our degree

1037.36 --> 1042.799
but they have senses right sentient

1040.4 --> 1042.799
sense

1042.88 --> 1047.7600000000002
they have senses

1045.039 --> 1052.12
they can sense things

1047.76 --> 1052.12
they feel things right

1053.919 --> 1058.4
plants not santiander oh oh really

1063.12 --> 1070.6399999999999
sentient does not mean you have senses

1066.559 --> 1074.28
so okay okay well maybe so what what

1070.64 --> 1074.2800000000002
does it mean then

1080.72 --> 1086.32
i mean is it like a sense of identity a

1083.52 --> 1088.48
separation or a sense of separation of

1086.32 --> 1092.039
you and other things

1088.48 --> 1092.039
what is it then

1096.799 --> 1101.52
you have a conscious experience

1099.84 --> 1103.6
to feel things

1101.52 --> 1106.4
yeah but that's the point if you sense

1103.6 --> 1108.799
it you feel it

1106.4 --> 1111.679
and how do you know conscious experience

1108.799 --> 1114.559
how do you know animals have a conscious

1111.679 --> 1116.96
experience like they are self-aware

1114.559 --> 1119.52
that's a conscious experience right

1116.96 --> 1122.52
how do you know plants aren't

1119.52 --> 1122.52
self-aware

1123.039 --> 1127.52
right self-aware

1125.12 --> 1129.76
sense of separate like a

1127.52 --> 1132.6399999999999
action based on the

1129.76 --> 1135.64
separation of you as an entity and other

1132.64 --> 1135.64
things

1137.28 --> 1140.96
like

1138.72 --> 1143.28
different tactical approaches to

1140.96 --> 1144.48
external things could be considered like

1143.28 --> 1148.039
that maybe a

1144.48 --> 1148.039
sentient trait

1151.2 --> 1157.1200000000001
plants communicate

1154.32 --> 1159.28
plants communicate to others

1157.12 --> 1161.6789999999999
of their species

1159.28 --> 1163.6789999999999
through the soil even

1161.679 --> 1167.679
like that's been proven it's been

1163.679 --> 1167.679
researched so how do you know

1169.039 --> 1173.12
an electric signal self-awareness

1171.28 --> 1175.9189999999999
demands complex

1173.12 --> 1178.9599999999998
oh well now it's

1175.919 --> 1181.2
getting a little uh a little convoluted

1178.96 --> 1181.2
now

1181.28 --> 1184.08
because

1182.08 --> 1186.96
what you just described kind of sounds

1184.08 --> 1189.76
like how i started out

1186.96 --> 1192.76
but yet you were very insistent to deny

1189.76 --> 1192.76
that

1199.039 --> 1207.1589999999999
we eat genetic animals but no not me

1203.76 --> 1207.1589999999999
gadget inspector

1210.24 --> 1215.28
god never made a cow

1213.28 --> 1219.2
well he did

1215.28 --> 1220.6399999999999
but we tamed it like if you let the cows

1219.2 --> 1223.6000000000001
just

1220.64 --> 1226.48
get around screw around what they do

1223.6 --> 1228.559
eventually they'll bewail there

1226.48 --> 1231.52
and they will start to resemble they

1228.559 --> 1233.12
will adapt back to the wild

1231.52 --> 1235.12
and they will start to resemble much

1233.12 --> 1238.1589999999999
more like how they started out so i kind

1235.12 --> 1238.1589999999999
of disagree with that

1246.64 --> 1250.48
there's no harmless flesh eating

1252.159 --> 1257.7600000000002
yeah but

1253.28 --> 1257.76
do the benefits weigh up against it

1259.12 --> 1264.559
if the animal was healthy had a good

1261.76 --> 1266.08
life not stressful not a natural

1264.559 --> 1268.559
environment

1266.08 --> 1270.799
then i think that

1268.559 --> 1272.08
the benefits do weigh up against the

1270.799 --> 1274.96
harm done

1272.08 --> 1277.12
and hey animals that are

1274.96 --> 1278.72
raised and treated very well and given

1277.12 --> 1280.8799999999999
kind of a natural

1278.72 --> 1283.84
experience

1280.88 --> 1285.679
i think that they are very acceptant

1283.84 --> 1287.52
even really

1285.679 --> 1290.48
of the entire setup

1287.52 --> 1292.08
now of course once they realize that

1290.48 --> 1295.44
they're about to be slaughtered or

1292.08 --> 1296.72
anything they're not gonna like it

1295.44 --> 1299.3600000000001
they never do

1296.72 --> 1300.24
that's you can never make them like

1299.36 --> 1301.84
choose

1300.24 --> 1304.32
death or something like that's never

1301.84 --> 1306.9599999999998
gonna happen they will never like that

1304.32 --> 1309.84
but everything else they do they love it

1306.96 --> 1309.8400000000001
a lot of the times

1314.96 --> 1320.88
if the animal is useless men would kill

1317.679 --> 1322.64
it yeah there's that effect right

1320.88 --> 1325.1200000000001
but yeah it's kind of a complicated

1322.64 --> 1328.0800000000002
argument to use really against veganism

1325.12 --> 1329.9189999999999
against spiritual veganism

1328.08 --> 1331.9189999999999
but yeah like oh

1329.919 --> 1334.159
if suddenly like eating meat was

1331.919 --> 1336.96
forbidden or something why would happen

1334.159 --> 1340.159
to all the cows

1336.96 --> 1343.919
you think they're just gonna be set free

1340.159 --> 1345.5200000000002
and then live a natural wild life no

1343.919 --> 1348.7990000000002
no they won't

1345.52 --> 1351.039
they'll all be executed

1348.799 --> 1354.08
and maybe recycled or something

1351.039 --> 1357.039
because then it's not worth maintaining

1354.08 --> 1357.039
them anymore

1357.12 --> 1361.84
yes don't you think about that vegan

1363.2 --> 1367.3600000000001
like

1364.24 --> 1370.559
not i have nothing against veganism

1367.36 --> 1372.6399999999999
like eating vegan has purposes

1370.559 --> 1375.76
it can be very good for your health

1372.64 --> 1379.2800000000002
sometimes or in specific scenarios it's

1375.76 --> 1382.24
just that spiritual veganism seems

1379.28 --> 1382.24
illogical to me

1382.64 --> 1386.7990000000002
the college would not be bred into

1384.32 --> 1388.96
existence yeah but what about those that

1386.799 --> 1391.679
already are

1388.96 --> 1391.679
andrew boy

1394.48 --> 1400.08
what they're just not gonna procreate

1397.2 --> 1401.039
and then the remaining food cows will

1400.08 --> 1404.72
just

1401.039 --> 1406.72
die of old age and no more cows

1404.72 --> 1408.96
think that's for the better then andrew

1406.72 --> 1408.96
boy

1411.2 --> 1416.72
do i have discord no well i do have a

1414.4 --> 1417.8400000000001
discord

1416.72 --> 1420.08
page

1417.84 --> 1422.6399999999999
but i don't really do anything with it

1420.08 --> 1424.08
definitely don't draft it into my show

1422.64 --> 1428.8400000000001
right now

1424.08 --> 1428.84
i don't need voice competition thanks

1432.72 --> 1436.039
oh cleary

1446.799 --> 1451.52
diary is rape

1449.039 --> 1454.52
and the permanent pregnancy of sentient

1451.52 --> 1454.52
beings

1466.0 --> 1469.32
oh no

1474.32 --> 1478.8799999999999
okay andrew boyce so

1476.24 --> 1480.88
let's get serious here right artificial

1478.88 --> 1484.159
insemination

1480.88 --> 1487.5200000000002
is there like a distinct

1484.159 --> 1489.679
psychological trauma that is detected

1487.52 --> 1492.559
with cows that for the first time have

1489.679 --> 1494.4
been artificially inseminated

1492.559 --> 1496.559
are they like

1494.4 --> 1496.5590000000002
like

1497.44 --> 1501.76
overly nervous or

1500.72 --> 1502.88
like

1501.76 --> 1505.039
yeah

1502.88 --> 1507.7600000000002
you know that would be signed are they

1505.039 --> 1509.6
on is that the thing if you even ask

1507.76 --> 1511.919
that question like

1509.6 --> 1514.3999999999999
you're calling it rape

1511.919 --> 1516.159
to like make a political case

1514.4 --> 1518.64
but

1516.159 --> 1520.4
i at least you're insinuating that but

1518.64 --> 1522.96
is it

1520.4 --> 1526.0800000000002
do they is it really that traumatizing

1522.96 --> 1527.6000000000001
that they have that done to them

1526.08 --> 1531.279
or

1527.6 --> 1533.6
like maybe this is actually just

1531.279 --> 1536.48
like what if it all the insemination

1533.6 --> 1538.48
actually happened with bulls right balls

1536.48 --> 1540.799
can be pretty rough especially when

1538.48 --> 1542.559
they're horny

1540.799 --> 1545.039
i think that the cows

1542.559 --> 1547.039
don't really mind it too much they're

1545.039 --> 1549.36
like oh at least we don't have to get

1547.039 --> 1551.039
the hassle of the freaking bulb

1549.36 --> 1553.76
like scratching my

1551.039 --> 1557.24
my my skin and all that

1553.76 --> 1557.24
giving me bruises

1558.4 --> 1562.5590000000002
yeah i knew it

1559.76 --> 1562.559
oh my god

1563.52 --> 1566.24
this is so

1568.799 --> 1572.8799999999999
off ring is removed oh really how do you

1571.36 --> 1575.039
know

1572.88 --> 1576.7990000000002
how do you know andrew boy

1575.039 --> 1578.8799999999999
because

1576.799 --> 1582.24
from what i've heard

1578.88 --> 1584.64
with like organic farms official

1582.24 --> 1586.32
and like even better demeter

1584.64 --> 1589.6000000000001
quality

1586.32 --> 1592.559
they don't just remove the calves

1589.6 --> 1595.6789999999999
they actually let them be birthed

1592.559 --> 1597.6789999999999
drink the milk

1595.679 --> 1598.88
and they kind of wean it off a little

1597.679 --> 1602.4
earlier

1598.88 --> 1604.24
but still they get the critical first

1602.4 --> 1606.3200000000002
first part of the milk right in with

1604.24 --> 1608.64
which the biggest immune boosts and all

1606.32 --> 1611.279
that is the inheritance that they get

1608.64 --> 1614.4
the inheritance that they get the health

1611.279 --> 1616.799
right and then the rest of the milk

1614.4 --> 1620.159
like is kind of kept on longer and

1616.799 --> 1622.559
that's how they do it so this is all

1620.159 --> 1623.919
what you are referring to is like the

1622.559 --> 1626.08
the like the

1623.919 --> 1627.44
mechanized

1626.08 --> 1630.3999999999999
factory

1627.44 --> 1633.1200000000001
farming which is pretty disgusting like

1630.4 --> 1635.2
non-organic farming where there the

1633.12 --> 1637.12
animals are treated like

1635.2 --> 1639.76
machines

1637.12 --> 1641.9189999999999
like crammed together and just not

1639.76 --> 1643.279
respected by the people that work with

1641.919 --> 1645.5200000000002
them

1643.279 --> 1647.44
cattle prods and all that

1645.52 --> 1652.2
so

1647.44 --> 1652.2
it sounds like you're mixing it up

1657.76 --> 1662.32
sounds like you're just thinking of like

1659.919 --> 1664.72
factory farming non-organic factory

1662.32 --> 1665.4399999999998
farming yeah and that's pretty bad it's

1664.72 --> 1667.279
not

1665.44 --> 1669.3600000000001
a nice setup i wouldn't want to eat from

1667.279 --> 1670.64
that especially after having learned

1669.36 --> 1673.36
from it

1670.64 --> 1675.279
guess what there's better farming though

1673.36 --> 1678.1589999999999
where the animals actually do have a

1675.279 --> 1678.159
pretty good life

1678.96 --> 1683.679
and a natural life with a natural

1681.36 --> 1685.76
environment

1683.679 --> 1687.279
and they get to grow up with others of

1685.76 --> 1688.64
their kind

1687.279 --> 1691.44
and even

1688.64 --> 1693.919
other creatures among them as well like

1691.44 --> 1696.159
cows and chickens just like

1693.919 --> 1698.64
being able to hang around each other and

1696.159 --> 1698.64
everything

1699.679 --> 1704.3990000000001
like i've been to

1701.44 --> 1706.48
demeter farms and it's like a little

1704.399 --> 1709.4399999999998
little paradises they are little

1706.48 --> 1710.72
paradises they're great and the animals

1709.44 --> 1713.039
are like

1710.72 --> 1715.44
thr they're thriving they're radiating

1713.039 --> 1718.72
energy palpably to me

1715.44 --> 1718.72
they're in a good place

1722.72 --> 1727.84
stupid people believe the only

1724.24 --> 1727.84
substitute for flesh is soy

1729.039 --> 1732.6
yeah thanks

1738.88 --> 1744.72
hello sam sam

1741.6 --> 1747.279
love my show yeah

1744.72 --> 1747.279
that's cool

1748.24 --> 1753.84
a paradise

1749.919 --> 1757.6000000000001
where the animals are murdered

1753.84 --> 1757.6
oh really how do you know

1761.2 --> 1764.64
i mean they're like the

1764.84 --> 1769.1999999999998
um the male

1767.12 --> 1770.1589999999999
cows the stairs yeah

1769.2 --> 1772.159
in

1770.159 --> 1772.96
farms with cows organic farms yeah they

1772.159 --> 1774.72
do

1772.96 --> 1778.88
eventually end up getting slaughtered

1774.72 --> 1781.6000000000001
sometimes they keep one for the breeding

1778.88 --> 1783.6000000000001
but like milk cows they don't slaughter

1781.6 --> 1784.7199999999998
them i think

1783.6 --> 1786.48
they just

1784.72 --> 1789.1200000000001
retire them

1786.48 --> 1789.1200000000001
eventually

1789.6 --> 1794.1589999999999
and retirement doesn't mean death they

1791.919 --> 1795.8400000000001
literally get their own little pasture

1794.159 --> 1799.279
where they can just

1795.84 --> 1800.08
chill hang around really

1799.279 --> 1802.399
so

1800.08 --> 1803.9189999999999
it sounds like you really don't know a

1802.399 --> 1805.9189999999999
lot

1803.919 --> 1807.679
about farming and the different types of

1805.919 --> 1811.1200000000001
farming andrew boy

1807.679 --> 1812.72
and you've just watched peta ads to

1811.12 --> 1816.559
freak you out

1812.72 --> 1819.1200000000001
showing you only the worst types

1816.559 --> 1820.96
of animal farming

1819.12 --> 1823.84
and you don't know anything else beyond

1820.96 --> 1823.8400000000001
that

1824.72 --> 1831.3990000000001
yeah see this is all just cookie cutter

1827.2 --> 1831.3990000000001
[ __ ] you're rolling out

1841.919 --> 1847.2
see this guy literally doesn't know what

1844.08 --> 1847.1999999999998
the [ __ ] he's talking about

1847.279 --> 1852.32
saw some peter and spiritual vegan

1850.159 --> 1855.5200000000002
videos and now he thinks that's what

1852.32 --> 1857.12
everything is and i bet in his mind

1855.52 --> 1859.519
he thinks that everything that i'm

1857.12 --> 1862.6399999999999
talking about like the good animal life

1859.519 --> 1865.279
that that's actually propaganda in order

1862.64 --> 1867.679
to keep the evil animal slaughtering

1865.279 --> 1871.12
going because secretly

1867.679 --> 1875.279
in the real world it's all just hell and

1871.12 --> 1875.279
and they get tortured and dude

1877.6 --> 1880.32
you

1878.799 --> 1884.6
you literally

1880.32 --> 1884.6
seem yeah you seem delusional

1894.72 --> 1898.96
if you don't milk a cow for two days it

1896.799 --> 1900.799
will i don't is that true

1898.96 --> 1902.72
well why you know that that's

1900.799 --> 1905.279
fascinating by the way

1902.72 --> 1907.039
because could it be that to a cow that

1905.279 --> 1909.76
is milking

1907.039 --> 1912.1589999999999
if the milk suddenly stops

1909.76 --> 1914.1589999999999
that that would be a sign

1912.159 --> 1914.96
nature wise

1914.159 --> 1917.279
she

1914.96 --> 1919.679
the cow that would be like certainly not

1917.279 --> 1923.919
be having the milk tapped anymore would

1919.679 --> 1927.279
it feel like its calf died

1923.919 --> 1928.72
because in nature yeah if you got a calf

1927.279 --> 1931.2
and suddenly

1928.72 --> 1932.32
the calf gets like grabbed by a lion or

1931.2 --> 1935.6000000000001
something

1932.32 --> 1938.559
an animal a wild animal it's dead

1935.6 --> 1939.76
and then the cow suddenly is like

1938.559 --> 1941.9189999999999
yeah

1939.76 --> 1944.32
my boobs are hard

1941.919 --> 1946.0800000000002
but it's not drinking that means my

1944.32 --> 1948.559
little one dead

1946.08 --> 1951.4399999999998
maybe it's that basic

1948.559 --> 1953.84
maybe it dies because

1951.44 --> 1956.0
like the body kind of signals it in a

1953.84 --> 1957.76
way that it will receive it as my calf

1956.0 --> 1961.559
is dead

1957.76 --> 1961.559
ever thought about that

1963.6 --> 1968.0
right and then if there would be other

1965.519 --> 1970.3990000000001
calves and they'd start drinking on

1968.0 --> 1972.64
the mother that whose calf had been

1970.399 --> 1974.9599999999998
grabbed by a wild animal

1972.64 --> 1979.44
that they would survive it because of

1974.96 --> 1979.44
well it didn't get that signal

1979.76 --> 1982.08
right

1989.2 --> 1991.8400000000001
ew

1991.919 --> 1996.64
took a tray of bacon that's disgusting

1994.159 --> 1996.64
clary

1998.08 --> 2001.6399999999999
that's just terrible

2007.679 --> 2014.1200000000001
fried hog

2009.919 --> 2014.1200000000001
no i don't eat pigs

2044.559 --> 2048.48
mastitis and

2046.32 --> 2050.3199999999997
infection yeah but how do you get that

2048.48 --> 2051.44
right that would be a sign of weakening

2050.32 --> 2056.2400000000002
so

2051.44 --> 2056.2400000000002
maybe the cow yeah as i said it right

2056.32 --> 2063.04
it's just the design decision

2060.399 --> 2066.399
like the cow doesn't even have to have a

2063.04 --> 2069.04
consciousness about family

2066.399 --> 2072.159
and death but just because of the sudden

2069.04 --> 2076.639
interruption of the natural cycle

2072.159 --> 2079.52
it takes it as a signal like it's dead

2076.639 --> 2081.679
in another way more physical way

2079.52 --> 2083.599
and then it gets stressed because of

2081.679 --> 2085.679
that and that's then how the infection

2083.599 --> 2088.56
and all that starts and it potentially

2085.679 --> 2089.599
dies right i'm just thinking through

2088.56 --> 2091.839
this

2089.599 --> 2091.839
because

2094.24 --> 2100.0789999999997
like why doesn't it just stop then

2097.52 --> 2102.16
what is it yeah well the sudden

2100.079 --> 2104.96
interruption like suddenly stopping in

2102.16 --> 2104.96
the middle of the

2106.16 --> 2109.68
of the breastfeeding cycle

2108.24 --> 2111.7599999999998
right

2109.68 --> 2114.48
what types of situations would that

2111.76 --> 2117.28
happen in on average on a

2114.48 --> 2119.839
physical visceral level well if the

2117.28 --> 2121.2000000000003
infant suddenly had died

2119.839 --> 2123.68
that

2121.2 --> 2129.7999999999997
is universally considered

2123.68 --> 2129.7999999999997
a trauma a traumatic influence so yeah

2130.8 --> 2135.5600000000004
anyway i think he's dropped off again

2149.76 --> 2154.1600000000003
there was never wild cows really

2152.88 --> 2157.8
no there were

2154.16 --> 2157.7999999999997
what about the buffaloes

2159.599 --> 2166.119
i mean aren't buffaloes

2162.079 --> 2166.119
types of cows basically

2189.28 --> 2192.6400000000003
oh god he's still here

2198.16 --> 2203.359
humans are not baby cars and do not need

2200.8 --> 2206.3590000000004
dairy yeah but they do need the cheese

2203.359 --> 2206.359
though

2227.2 --> 2231.2799999999997
i feel like if it would be as if you

2230.079 --> 2233.6800000000003
were

2231.28 --> 2235.76
to keep eating and eating and drinking

2233.68 --> 2238.72
continually

2235.76 --> 2242.5200000000004
you don't have a booty hole

2238.72 --> 2242.52
to excrete the waste

2244.64 --> 2249.839
well look yeah you can eat too much and

2247.68 --> 2252.96
then your entire metabolism is just

2249.839 --> 2256.32
heavily overburdened

2252.96 --> 2257.76
like the the organs can't handle the

2256.32 --> 2259.6800000000003
amounts

2257.76 --> 2262.7200000000003
yeah and then

2259.68 --> 2262.72
things can go wrong

2263.119 --> 2266.1600000000003
but

2264.8 --> 2268.1600000000003
what

2266.16 --> 2271.839
what is that is that related to the

2268.16 --> 2271.839
whole cow and milk thing

2274.32 --> 2280.839
you don't eat anything with four legs

2276.16 --> 2280.839
okay that's an interesting way to put it

2292.0 --> 2296.4
yeah okay andrew boy

2295.04 --> 2299.839
we get it

2296.4 --> 2299.839
you're a vegan

2299.92 --> 2304.2400000000002
okay we get it we heard it

2302.8 --> 2308.079
it's enough

2304.24 --> 2308.0789999999997
stop squirting it's annoying

2311.2 --> 2316.16
like we are not vegans

2313.599 --> 2319.839
we don't agree with your overly

2316.16 --> 2319.839
sensitive irrational

2321.359 --> 2327.2799999999997
religious view

2323.52 --> 2330.56
because it is it's beyond just basic

2327.28 --> 2332.4
diet sensibility right it's a religious

2330.56 --> 2335.2
view

2332.4 --> 2336.88
we don't give a [ __ ] i'm sorry we don't

2335.2 --> 2339.8799999999997
give a [ __ ]

2336.88 --> 2339.88
right

2340.0 --> 2342.96
and hey i've had

2343.28 --> 2348.0
i have respect for some people that were

2345.68 --> 2350.7999999999997
vegans like patricia steer was kind of a

2348.0 --> 2353.44
spiritual vegan too

2350.8 --> 2356.0
but at least she wouldn't be just

2353.44 --> 2358.4
whining about it she would respect

2356.0 --> 2360.16
people

2358.4 --> 2362.079
that weren't vegan

2360.16 --> 2364.24
right why didn't you take example to

2362.079 --> 2366.6400000000003
that why don't you just stop whining

2364.24 --> 2369.1189999999997
about it people are not gonna stop

2366.64 --> 2371.44
eating meat because you're an

2369.119 --> 2374.96
oversensitive little [ __ ] about it it

2371.44 --> 2376.64
never works ever

2374.96 --> 2379.28
as you already saw there's some people

2376.64 --> 2380.8799999999997
that in response to that start getting

2379.28 --> 2383.119
trollish and like

2380.88 --> 2385.44
start to think how fun it is to actually

2383.119 --> 2387.359
bring plates of bacon

2385.44 --> 2389.599
to vegan conventions right that's

2387.359 --> 2391.5989999999997
because of what you do right now do you

2389.599 --> 2394.1600000000003
understand that andrew boy

2391.599 --> 2397.28
it's because of that attitude

2394.16 --> 2399.7599999999998
it's not working

2397.28 --> 2401.119
you're acting like a social justice

2399.76 --> 2403.2000000000003
warrior

2401.119 --> 2406.1600000000003
with food

2403.2 --> 2409.52
it's annoying

2406.16 --> 2412.72
and it's taken out of proportion

2409.52 --> 2415.44
it's not rational it's not practical

2412.72 --> 2419.359
it's overly dramatic

2415.44 --> 2422.56
you're attributing feelings and ideas

2419.359 --> 2424.48
to animals that you don't know

2422.56 --> 2427.119
with certainty they have because you

2424.48 --> 2430.319
haven't really dug into the

2427.119 --> 2430.319
animal psychology

2432.0 --> 2436.16
no other reason beyond taste pleasure

2434.4 --> 2439.119
nonsense

2436.16 --> 2441.1189999999997
it's nourishing

2439.119 --> 2442.6400000000003
there's a lot of

2441.119 --> 2446.88
meat

2442.64 --> 2450.56
and like bone extract and all that

2446.88 --> 2454.4
that is extremely nourishing

2450.56 --> 2457.04
and that you to get the same results

2454.4 --> 2460.96
based purely on plants

2457.04 --> 2463.2799999999997
is difficult and comes with all kinds of

2460.96 --> 2466.319
side effects

2463.28 --> 2469.119
that are counterproductive

2466.319 --> 2471.92
right that's why so many vegans

2469.119 --> 2474.4
start turning into gamma

2471.92 --> 2476.96
[ __ ]

2474.4 --> 2479.28
and that's not even because they eat a

2476.96 --> 2482.56
lot of soy milk

2479.28 --> 2483.599
that certainly aggravates it a lot

2482.56 --> 2485.599
but you

2483.599 --> 2488.319
just because they get everything from

2485.599 --> 2490.6400000000003
plants it changes them it often makes

2488.319 --> 2492.16
them more agitated

2490.64 --> 2494.319
it really does

2492.16 --> 2496.3999999999996
makes you more sensitive but also more

2494.319 --> 2498.72
agitated

2496.4 --> 2501.76
because you start whining like a little

2498.72 --> 2505.16
[ __ ] like you are doing right now

2501.76 --> 2505.1600000000003
andrew boy

2531.52 --> 2535.04
oh god don't drag all that in there

2533.68 --> 2538.319
kevin

2535.04 --> 2538.319
barbato god

2540.96 --> 2546.8
you don't eat pigs dolphins

2543.92 --> 2548.64
and seek what

2546.8 --> 2550.88
what

2548.64 --> 2552.8799999999997
yeah no i don't eat dolphins and sea

2550.88 --> 2555.2000000000003
cows either

2552.88 --> 2559.359
well sea cows would be extremely rich in

2555.2 --> 2559.359
fat but no don't do that

2560.56 --> 2567.2799999999997
i'd prefer to like

2563.2 --> 2569.7599999999998
let the sea creatures just be

2567.28 --> 2571.8390000000004
as much as possible

2569.76 --> 2573.92
i mean we've already

2571.839 --> 2576.16
and this is a thing

2573.92 --> 2577.6800000000003
there's been so many whales killed like

2576.16 --> 2580.3999999999996
in

2577.68 --> 2582.3999999999996
in the late 19th century early 20th it's

2580.4 --> 2585.44
horrific there were

2582.4 --> 2586.64
tons and tons of whales around

2585.44 --> 2588.56
everywhere

2586.64 --> 2590.72
flocks everywhere

2588.56 --> 2593.7599999999998
and they well yeah they were basically

2590.72 --> 2596.64
hunted down to extinction almost

2593.76 --> 2598.2400000000002
we're very lucky they're still around

2596.64 --> 2600.56
most of them

2598.24 --> 2602.8799999999997
well most of the species but they're

2600.56 --> 2606.92
much more rare now right that's

2602.88 --> 2606.92
something that i don't like

2613.92 --> 2616.56
i'm not

2614.96 --> 2619.04
a guy that's

2616.56 --> 2621.04
like very chinese minded that's just

2619.04 --> 2623.44
like no just eat everything eat

2621.04 --> 2623.44
everything

2623.52 --> 2629.28
creepy [ __ ] and

2626.16 --> 2630.64
crazy stuff no thanks

2629.28 --> 2634.0
it's like

2630.64 --> 2634.8799999999997
deep fried spiders and

2634.0 --> 2636.4
yak

2634.88 --> 2637.599
anyway

2636.4 --> 2642.0
but yeah

2637.599 --> 2642.0
regular fish things like salmon

2643.52 --> 2649.599
like don't overfish but yeah i i

2646.48 --> 2652.319
i need fish oil

2649.599 --> 2655.28
i really do

2652.319 --> 2657.68
but i would not want fish to be hunted

2655.28 --> 2659.6800000000003
into extinction either

2657.68 --> 2662.0
and i think that's why like fish

2659.68 --> 2664.3999999999996
breeding programs non-freaking

2662.0 --> 2666.319
genetically modified things

2664.4 --> 2670.7200000000003
would be a really good investment for

2666.319 --> 2670.72
the future of humanity and the world

2672.48 --> 2678.4
i have good policies to ensure that

2675.68 --> 2679.839
fish can actually thrive it would be

2678.4 --> 2682.079
even better if

2679.839 --> 2684.88
we'd allow them to breed

2682.079 --> 2687.6800000000003
to become much more because then we can

2684.88 --> 2689.599
reap from them more

2687.68 --> 2692.3999999999996
right

2689.599 --> 2694.48
but it's really the grappling just

2692.4 --> 2696.319
getting out all getting you know get to

2694.48 --> 2699.119
quickly get all the profits before the

2696.319 --> 2703.88
other get him right that's a big problem

2699.119 --> 2703.88
out there over fishing is terrible

2712.56 --> 2718.96
i think fish want you to eat them

2716.0 --> 2723.119
i don't think that fish think

2718.96 --> 2723.119
to that level kevin barbado

2724.8 --> 2729.04
i mean a lot of the fish are much like

2727.44 --> 2731.359
very collective

2729.04 --> 2733.92
minded

2731.359 --> 2736.0789999999997
right and that's typically the ones that

2733.92 --> 2738.4
are also very tasty it's the ones that

2736.079 --> 2740.319
like go around it with like thousands

2738.4 --> 2742.2400000000002
and thousands in big

2740.319 --> 2744.48
clouds of fish

2742.24 --> 2746.319
and move around collectively

2744.48 --> 2747.599
like they don't give a [ __ ] if some of

2746.319 --> 2749.839
them die

2747.599 --> 2751.599
because there's there they are the

2749.839 --> 2754.0
collective so they just don't think

2751.599 --> 2754.0
about it

2754.88 --> 2757.28
anyway

2758.72 --> 2763.9199999999996
swordfish oh what the hell

2761.68 --> 2765.839
i don't really like

2763.92 --> 2767.92
big

2765.839 --> 2770.56
like

2767.92 --> 2770.56
big fish

2772.88 --> 2777.28
dude i've been to like

2774.88 --> 2779.92
a harbor

2777.28 --> 2782.1600000000003
where they would like

2779.92 --> 2785.28
fit where they would unload like deep

2782.16 --> 2788.64
sea fish giant fish

2785.28 --> 2790.8
and it would horrify me not because the

2788.64 --> 2792.72
fish were creepy but because they had

2790.8 --> 2795.8390000000004
senses and i could literally feel it at

2792.72 --> 2800.0789999999997
a distance and it was terrible

2795.839 --> 2801.68
and like those fishermen were not like

2800.079 --> 2803.119
they were just fishermen they didn't

2801.68 --> 2805.1189999999997
give a [ __ ]

2803.119 --> 2806.96
they didn't care for the feelings of the

2805.119 --> 2811.2000000000003
fish

2806.96 --> 2811.2
and i did not like that at all

2811.599 --> 2815.6800000000003
felt like was disrespectful and probably

2813.839 --> 2817.2
a lot of that fish would end up just

2815.68 --> 2819.2799999999997
rotting somewhere

2817.2 --> 2822.16
and that was a terrible idea

2819.28 --> 2824.96
like the slaughter for nothing

2822.16 --> 2824.96
but anyway

2828.96 --> 2831.96
breatharian

2832.72 --> 2836.52
breatharian ring

2847.68 --> 2853.44
yeah breathtarian is a thing

2850.4 --> 2856.88
it's weird it's complicated

2853.44 --> 2858.8
it's not the ultimate solution

2856.88 --> 2862.2400000000002
like the idea

2858.8 --> 2863.599
that oh maybe one day we'll we'll ascend

2862.24 --> 2864.64
above

2863.599 --> 2866.4
eating

2864.64 --> 2868.64
and then nobody would have to eat

2866.4 --> 2871.52
anybody ever again

2868.64 --> 2874.24
like in the paradise that's complete

2871.52 --> 2874.24
horseshit

2874.64 --> 2880.0
that's not something that's gonna happen

2877.52 --> 2881.68
on earth

2880.0 --> 2882.88
not here

2881.68 --> 2886.16
no

2882.88 --> 2888.319
it's all part of the challenge

2886.16 --> 2892.96
just gotta get over

2888.319 --> 2892.96
whiny oversensitive feelings

2893.2 --> 2897.9199999999996
those are like things that when you're a

2895.92 --> 2899.92
little kid and you for the first time

2897.92 --> 2901.839
find out yeah this what you're eating

2899.92 --> 2903.599
right now actually came from an animal

2901.839 --> 2906.0
that was killed

2903.599 --> 2908.88
when i got to heard that the first few

2906.0 --> 2911.68
times it was very shocking i cried

2908.88 --> 2911.6800000000003
as a little kid

2912.48 --> 2918.0
but i also felt like yeah but i

2916.079 --> 2920.96
need it

2918.0 --> 2922.64
i really needed it i felt

2920.96 --> 2925.44
that it had a

2922.64 --> 2928.68
good impact on my system it would make

2925.44 --> 2928.68
me stronger

2940.24 --> 2943.839
what mike's doing what are you talking

2954.839 --> 2961.04
about what are my

2958.24 --> 2963.839
thoughts on old testament

2961.04 --> 2966.16
prohibiting consumption of shellfish

2963.839 --> 2968.7999999999997
crab and lobster yeah yeah i think that

2966.16 --> 2970.96
that was actually a diet tip of that era

2968.8 --> 2972.48
steamy traveler you see

2970.96 --> 2975.2
shellfish

2972.48 --> 2977.119
are literally bottom feeders

2975.2 --> 2978.3999999999996
so

2977.119 --> 2981.119
in an age

2978.4 --> 2984.0
where environmentalism

2981.119 --> 2987.44
and like the toxic influences of

2984.0 --> 2990.88
manufacturing and mining especially

2987.44 --> 2994.4
hadn't been truly been studied

2990.88 --> 2996.319
and responded to and adapted to properly

2994.4 --> 2999.76
let's just say there's like a

2996.319 --> 3002.16
mine somewhere a gold mine right mercury

2999.76 --> 3004.2400000000002
there's gonna be mercury and [ __ ]

3002.16 --> 3007.04
and they just poured that [ __ ] in the

3004.24 --> 3008.7999999999997
river because like yeah what else the

3007.04 --> 3010.72
waste what else are you gonna do with it

3008.8 --> 3012.88
they're not gonna like oh store it in

3010.72 --> 3014.9599999999996
drums and keep it safe because it's so

3012.88 --> 3016.319
boy no no no they just chuck that [ __ ]

3014.96 --> 3019.2
in the river

3016.319 --> 3020.5589999999997
and then it would end up at the ocean on

3019.2 --> 3022.64
the bottom

3020.559 --> 3024.2400000000002
guess who's on the bottom of the ocean

3022.64 --> 3027.2799999999997
looking for food

3024.24 --> 3028.16
it's the shellfish

3027.28 --> 3031.28
right

3028.16 --> 3033.2799999999997
so in ancient times when there was

3031.28 --> 3035.76
ancient industry

3033.28 --> 3038.079
and people would just chalk extremely

3035.76 --> 3040.6400000000003
poisonous [ __ ] in the river

3038.079 --> 3042.4
the bottom feeders would end up

3040.64 --> 3043.92
absorbing

3042.4 --> 3044.64
that garbage

3043.92 --> 3046.96
so

3044.64 --> 3048.7999999999997
there were probably whole regions

3046.96 --> 3050.88
where the crab fish

3048.8 --> 3053.2000000000003
would be poisonous and they might even

3050.88 --> 3055.2000000000003
become like a plague in nuisances like

3053.2 --> 3057.4399999999996
oh this entire

3055.2 --> 3059.04
sea is like crawling with these crabs

3057.44 --> 3061.359
but don't eat them

3059.04 --> 3064.24
because you'll get really sick

3061.359 --> 3064.24
like the miners

3064.64 --> 3069.7599999999998
right it might come from that

3067.68 --> 3071.52
because they just the nature of

3069.76 --> 3074.559
shellfish is that they are bottom

3071.52 --> 3076.4
feeders they they eat [ __ ]

3074.559 --> 3077.92
including like dead

3076.4 --> 3080.8
stuff

3077.92 --> 3080.8
dyed creatures

3080.839 --> 3085.92
died

3082.4 --> 3085.92
other what do you call them uh

3087.92 --> 3093.119
like oysters and all that those types of

3090.48 --> 3095.76
creatures they would die too they just

3093.119 --> 3098.48
freaking eat the the dead flesh of that

3095.76 --> 3102.48
so they would end up kind of like pigs

3098.48 --> 3102.48
right pigs also like eat anything

3103.2 --> 3107.2799999999997
and that's yeah in an age where there's

3105.04 --> 3109.119
just poison being used industrially and

3107.28 --> 3112.0
just chalked in the river then yeah

3109.119 --> 3114.079
those shellfish would end up eating that

3112.0 --> 3116.64
so i think it's just an

3114.079 --> 3116.6400000000003
ancient

3117.119 --> 3120.559
dietary tip

3118.72 --> 3124.48
basically

3120.559 --> 3126.48
adapted to that age right because now it

3124.48 --> 3128.2400000000002
is not that bad anymore we have other

3126.48 --> 3131.599
types of pollution issues we have like

3128.24 --> 3134.16
micro plastics and all that [ __ ]

3131.599 --> 3136.8
but those tend to float so the bottom

3134.16 --> 3138.48
feeders have less

3136.8 --> 3140.7200000000003
like really

3138.48 --> 3142.72
poisonous

3140.72 --> 3145.7599999999998
toxins

3142.72 --> 3147.5989999999997
in them because we don't just chalk it

3145.76 --> 3149.5200000000004
in the river anymore

3147.599 --> 3152.52
in a lot of places

3149.52 --> 3152.52
see

3153.119 --> 3158.2400000000002
oh right oh yeah and that and that of

3155.76 --> 3159.44
course yes very good point clearly yeah

3158.24 --> 3161.839
shellfish

3159.44 --> 3164.8
rot really quickly if you don't

3161.839 --> 3167.52
refrigerate them properly

3164.8 --> 3169.8390000000004
and in ancient times the only thing they

3167.52 --> 3170.8
had was like cool cellars they didn't

3169.839 --> 3172.72
have

3170.8 --> 3174.48
it wasn't cold enough and if you then

3172.72 --> 3177.2799999999997
like leave

3174.48 --> 3179.2
the hunted crab or something one day too

3177.28 --> 3180.8
long accidentally you don't really see

3179.2 --> 3183.2
it

3180.8 --> 3185.2000000000003
but it could you could get really bad

3183.2 --> 3187.9199999999996
food poisoning from it i've actually

3185.2 --> 3190.5589999999997
witnessed my family

3187.92 --> 3193.839
one time in spain

3190.559 --> 3197.599
on vacation and they all ate like crabs

3193.839 --> 3197.599
or something or was it like um

3198.96 --> 3203.2
what's the name muscles

3201.599 --> 3205.2000000000003
like those

3203.2 --> 3206.0789999999997
shell things that typically

3205.2 --> 3209.2799999999997
on

3206.079 --> 3211.119
sit on piers in masses you can eat those

3209.28 --> 3214.3190000000004
too and they ate some of those and they

3211.119 --> 3215.52
were bad and they got really sick and i

3214.319 --> 3218.0
was like

3215.52 --> 3220.16
i'm not really sick because i didn't eat

3218.0 --> 3220.16
it

3221.2 --> 3226.4399999999996
yeah

3222.96 --> 3226.44
you got to be careful

3240.8 --> 3244.1600000000003
what is it i want to know the name now

3243.119 --> 3247.48
of that

3244.16 --> 3247.48
type of creature

3254.559 --> 3259.2000000000003
oh they they're called muscles okay

3257.52 --> 3262.0
right muscles

3259.2 --> 3264.319
very common type of

3262.0 --> 3267.2
coastal creature they always like gather

3264.319 --> 3269.359
on piers and sometimes on rocky surfaces

3267.2 --> 3272.8799999999997
and you can eat those

3269.359 --> 3272.88
they can grow pretty big

3272.96 --> 3276.7200000000003
but yeah

3274.24 --> 3278.3999999999996
they can be spoiled and if you leave

3276.72 --> 3280.5589999999997
them out too long

3278.4 --> 3284.1600000000003
without properly refrigerating them you

3280.559 --> 3287.76
could get really sick from eating them

3284.16 --> 3290.0789999999997
and that's even in unpoisoned conditions

3287.76 --> 3291.76
that's even in clean waters

3290.079 --> 3293.92
so can you imagine what happens if

3291.76 --> 3297.3590000000004
they're also saturated with like heavy

3293.92 --> 3297.359
metals and garbage

3297.599 --> 3301.119
waste

3298.64 --> 3304.16
toxins from mining

3301.119 --> 3306.319
yeah that could be pretty damn hazardous

3304.16 --> 3307.68
and also compounding right because they

3306.319 --> 3310.52
you would be

3307.68 --> 3312.72
collecting compounding poisons

3310.52 --> 3315.28
biocumulative poisons that they'd be

3312.72 --> 3317.839
gathering and if you then constantly eat

3315.28 --> 3320.799
that if you eat mussels like every day

3317.839 --> 3323.44
in ancient times yeah you'd probably be

3320.799 --> 3326.079
severely chronically ill in some way in

3323.44 --> 3326.079
like a month

3328.079 --> 3331.76
yeah yeah

3329.2 --> 3334.72
yeah muscles are in past italian pasta

3331.76 --> 3336.7990000000004
dishes a lot yeah that's right

3334.72 --> 3339.839
i don't like those dishes i don't eat

3336.799 --> 3339.839
mussels i never do

3342.4 --> 3347.44
i used to go snorkeling when i was a kid

3345.2 --> 3350.48
and then like

3347.44 --> 3351.599
i did like watching little fishies eat

3350.48 --> 3352.96
mussels

3351.599 --> 3354.319
so i'd like

3352.96 --> 3356.64
yeah

3354.319 --> 3358.4
just cut one of like the hundreds of

3356.64 --> 3360.72
thousands of mussels that hang around

3358.4 --> 3362.64
and then all the fish is certainly like

3360.72 --> 3364.24
the cloak because they had like

3362.64 --> 3365.92
camouflaging colors just suddenly like

3364.24 --> 3367.839
storm

3365.92 --> 3370.96
eat the whole thing in like a minute and

3367.839 --> 3372.799
i was always fascinated about that

3370.96 --> 3375.799
so i was like feeding the fishes in the

3372.799 --> 3375.799
sea

3393.28 --> 3398.88
when [ __ ] hits the fan you ain't gonna

3395.359 --> 3400.88
eat enough beans and veg to survive

3398.88 --> 3402.079
well clap ruckus

3400.88 --> 3403.599
you could

3402.079 --> 3405.119
if you

3403.599 --> 3408.079
do a lot of

3405.119 --> 3409.76
sensible storage of the food right you

3408.079 --> 3412.559
can them

3409.76 --> 3414.48
you freeze dry them put them in pots all

3412.559 --> 3416.6400000000003
that and then

3414.48 --> 3418.799
even during like

3416.64 --> 3421.2
really bad harvesting spells though it

3418.799 --> 3423.359
all goes rotten or suddenly it freezes

3421.2 --> 3424.319
to death because of a sudden freeze

3423.359 --> 3426.88
spell

3424.319 --> 3429.68
and the entire harvest is screwed or if

3426.88 --> 3432.96
you have potted stuff

3429.68 --> 3437.24
then that actually works out

3432.96 --> 3437.2400000000002
you could survive on that

3451.92 --> 3458.6800000000003
okay weird the documentary woman said

3454.559 --> 3458.6800000000003
she was practicing ritharianism

3462.24 --> 3467.2799999999997
extremely unhealthy and underweight

3465.04 --> 3469.599
weird

3467.28 --> 3469.599
weird

3470.16 --> 3474.48
look

3472.0 --> 3478.16
i don't i'm not even 100 sure whether

3474.48 --> 3480.2400000000002
this idea of breathtarianism came from

3478.16 --> 3482.0
i do however know

3480.24 --> 3484.72
that periodic

3482.0 --> 3487.72
fasting is really healthy for your

3484.72 --> 3487.72
system

3489.44 --> 3494.799
right but that's not permanently

3491.839 --> 3494.799
stopping eating

3495.04 --> 3501.4
so i don't know what that is i don't

3497.44 --> 3501.4
even know where it came from

3503.52 --> 3506.88
a lot of people can't

3505.76 --> 3508.7990000000004
eat

3506.88 --> 3510.6400000000003
it seafood

3508.799 --> 3512.64
because of the amount of iodine

3510.64 --> 3515.2
especially shellfish

3512.64 --> 3516.72
well yeah dude but that's the whole

3515.2 --> 3519.68
thing about it

3516.72 --> 3522.799
iodine yeah it's around but it can be

3519.68 --> 3523.839
contaminated very easily it binds very

3522.799 --> 3526.319
easily

3523.839 --> 3530.2799999999997
so yeah that type of iodine is not

3526.319 --> 3530.2799999999997
always the best type

3530.4 --> 3535.839
right now if you get it from

3532.72 --> 3535.839
what do you call them again the

3536.88 --> 3541.76
the seaweed there's this special iodine

3540.0 --> 3545.04
rich seaweed

3541.76 --> 3547.5200000000004
it's a kelp right kelp

3545.04 --> 3551.2
kelp is pretty good

3547.52 --> 3553.04
it it kind of purifies it a little

3551.2 --> 3555.5989999999997
but yeah

3553.04 --> 3558.319
the eating kelp is actually does help

3555.599 --> 3561.3590000000004
you get good iodine

3558.319 --> 3563.68
it's not perfect but it's better than

3561.359 --> 3568.839
the if you just got all your iodine

3563.68 --> 3568.839
through like shellfish yeah definitely

3574.24 --> 3578.16
fasting is very common among

3575.68 --> 3580.799
hunter-gatherers well fasting is

3578.16 --> 3582.799
actually very normal even among animals

3580.799 --> 3586.72
especially hunting animals like do you

3582.799 --> 3589.04
even realize most hunting animals

3586.72 --> 3593.359
they like

3589.04 --> 3593.359
don't eat for half a year sometimes

3594.96 --> 3599.359
and and they do fine

3598.079 --> 3601.28
and then when they

3599.359 --> 3603.2799999999997
like start hunting

3601.28 --> 3605.0400000000004
or they they really

3603.28 --> 3607.44
strike lucky

3605.04 --> 3610.16
and then they like divide devour the

3607.44 --> 3612.799
whole thing or as much as they can fit

3610.16 --> 3615.839
in their body

3612.799 --> 3620.52
and then they can like yeah

3615.839 --> 3620.52
do another half a year without food

3631.359 --> 3637.04
when we do a brain scan they pump you

3633.52 --> 3639.2
with eye no i don't think that's iodine

3637.04 --> 3640.88
gadgets i think that's another type of

3639.2 --> 3643.5989999999997
chemical

3640.88 --> 3645.76
that's kind of close it's isn't that

3643.599 --> 3647.92
like bromium don't they use bromium for

3645.76 --> 3647.92
that

3653.52 --> 3658.64
i don't think they i've never heard of

3655.2 --> 3658.64
iodine being used

3658.799 --> 3663.96
to for scans i thought that was bromine

3676.24 --> 3681.52
i o didn't is that is iodin something

3679.52 --> 3685.0
different as iodine

3681.52 --> 3685.0
okay the inspector

3706.079 --> 3712.04
lcg nobody cares about insect well i

3708.48 --> 3712.04
care about insects

3712.88 --> 3717.28
i do

3714.319 --> 3718.88
but yeah they are insects they are

3717.28 --> 3721.76
lesser like

3718.88 --> 3724.88
if you have to weigh an animal

3721.76 --> 3724.88
versus an insect

3725.28 --> 3733.599
yeah the animal would win for me

3729.599 --> 3735.839
but insects are like kind of like plants

3733.599 --> 3738.88
on that level to me like yeah they do

3735.839 --> 3741.2
have life value i do respect insects i

3738.88 --> 3744.2400000000002
actually like some insects like spiders

3741.2 --> 3746.0
i really like spiders

3744.24 --> 3748.799
but that's also because we don't have

3746.0 --> 3751.119
like these really dangerous tropical

3748.799 --> 3753.0389999999998
poisonous spiders here

3751.119 --> 3756.7200000000003
because i'd probably not like them if

3753.039 --> 3756.7200000000003
i'd be living in the tropics

3757.68 --> 3762.16
but yeah they get the bugs i love them

3759.92 --> 3765.52
and i really like butterflies and i

3762.16 --> 3767.52
really like moths and i really like bees

3765.52 --> 3768.96
i like all the bee types i don't like

3767.52 --> 3771.52
wasps though

3768.96 --> 3773.76
but i i'm not like oh kill all the wasps

3771.52 --> 3776.48
no it's just like get out you're this is

3773.76 --> 3776.48
not your place

3777.76 --> 3781.3190000000004
don't kill him

3789.44 --> 3795.2400000000002
types of insects that are forbidden to

3791.44 --> 3795.2400000000002
eat any other weird

3798.96 --> 3804.4
oh i don't eat insects

3801.52 --> 3804.4
i don't do that

3805.92 --> 3808.92
yuck

3810.88 --> 3815.28
i mean

3812.24 --> 3816.8799999999997
i know it's possible it's like okay

3815.28 --> 3819.2000000000003
you're in the wild you're not gonna

3816.88 --> 3820.319
reach civilization in any sort of way

3819.2 --> 3822.72
for like

3820.319 --> 3822.72
months

3823.28 --> 3828.3190000000004
and you can't find any proper source of

3825.44 --> 3831.28
food but there's like bugs around

3828.319 --> 3834.16
that you know are edible

3831.28 --> 3836.2400000000002
then yeah i'd probably like choose okay

3834.16 --> 3837.2799999999997
let's eat those bugs i don't want to

3836.24 --> 3841.1189999999997
starve

3837.28 --> 3844.48
but i wouldn't like it yuck

3841.119 --> 3844.48
oh god i wouldn't like it

3844.72 --> 3846.9599999999996
right

3847.039 --> 3851.6800000000003
i would never just like

3849.92 --> 3854.0
choose bugs

3851.68 --> 3854.0
yuck

3856.64 --> 3860.64
are you dying

3858.48 --> 3862.559
okay gadget inspector well i've never

3860.64 --> 3864.16
heard of that could be

3862.559 --> 3865.8390000000004
i remember

3864.16 --> 3866.799
when i had to go through some kind of a

3865.839 --> 3869.2799999999997
scan

3866.799 --> 3873.52
that they made me drink

3869.28 --> 3873.52
like some weird bromine [ __ ]

3873.839 --> 3878.319
i think

3875.76 --> 3882.2400000000002
that's what i remember

3878.319 --> 3882.24
so i don't know about the iodine

3884.96 --> 3890.319
id iodine for thyroid exam okay yeah

3888.24 --> 3892.0
that makes sense

3890.319 --> 3893.7599999999998
barium

3892.0 --> 3895.68
oh

3893.76 --> 3897.119
that it could be barium yes yes you're

3895.68 --> 3899.2
right seeking star yeah i might have

3897.119 --> 3900.88
mixed them up bromine

3899.2 --> 3905.64
it could have been barium i don't know

3900.88 --> 3905.6400000000003
it was something with a b i think

3908.4 --> 3912.88
but anyway they said it was basically

3910.48 --> 3914.4
harmless it would just

3912.88 --> 3916.559
be

3914.4 --> 3918.88
dealt with by your kidneys and

3916.559 --> 3920.88
completely flushed without any damage so

3918.88 --> 3923.839
i trusted on

3920.88 --> 3923.839
the doctors back then

3925.039 --> 3931.92
i don't feel it did anything terrible

3928.64 --> 3934.319
didn't feel even bad having it in me

3931.92 --> 3934.319
whatever

3934.559 --> 3937.559
uh

3959.52 --> 3962.52
hmm

3967.92 --> 3973.76
it will force every dude they think they

3970.4 --> 3973.76
can do all kinds of [ __ ]

3977.599 --> 3981.92
they're not gonna make us

3979.359 --> 3981.92
they can't

3987.839 --> 3992.48
they can only order you to do it and

3990.319 --> 3994.799
then you being such a slave and a [ __ ]

3992.48 --> 3997.119
that you'll just do it to try and please

3994.799 --> 3998.4
the empire that's the only way they can

3997.119 --> 4000.48
do it

3998.4 --> 4002.88
because you can't force everybody to do

4000.48 --> 4004.559
you can't actually force everybody to do

4002.88 --> 4007.119
it

4004.559 --> 4010.7200000000003
you couldn't even with robot armies

4007.119 --> 4010.7200000000003
that's just not possible

4010.88 --> 4015.76
like we'd

4012.96 --> 4019.599
like if being forced

4015.76 --> 4021.8390000000004
people are gonna revolt

4019.599 --> 4024.559
and then organized revolt

4021.839 --> 4027.2799999999997
and then basically just yeah

4024.559 --> 4029.6800000000003
goodbye people trying to enforce that

4027.28 --> 4032.799
you're going to all be executed they

4029.68 --> 4035.44
can't actually do that mechanically they

4032.799 --> 4038.4
can only trick you into believing it's

4035.44 --> 4041.28
happening and then making you so afraid

4038.4 --> 4043.44
that you'll just do it to try and please

4041.28 --> 4048.8390000000004
the empire that's what they're doing

4043.44 --> 4048.839
right now they can't actually force it

4054.0 --> 4057.839
because then the whole setup would

4055.76 --> 4059.92
explode

4057.839 --> 4061.92
then the spell would break and everybody

4059.92 --> 4064.48
would snap out of it and much the

4061.92 --> 4066.48
elastic backlash would be so much

4064.48 --> 4069.48
further than people even realize right

4066.48 --> 4069.48
now

4078.96 --> 4081.599
mercury and

4088.839 --> 4093.44
shellfish yeah

4090.88 --> 4094.96
yeah but that's your correct rest ad

4093.44 --> 4099.199
yeah but

4094.96 --> 4102.799
look iodine and mercury do kind of like

4099.199 --> 4105.839
they react they bind to one another and

4102.799 --> 4105.839
then it's not good

4108.48 --> 4113.12
right so it's more like polluted iodine

4111.12 --> 4114.719
and it could be polluted with mercury

4113.12 --> 4117.3589999999995
that's right

4114.719 --> 4120.64
i literally brought that up right

4117.359 --> 4123.52
old ancient mining they used mercury it

4120.64 --> 4125.759
chucked the remnants in the water

4123.52 --> 4127.279
it lands on the bottom of the ocean

4125.759 --> 4128.4
shellfish

4127.279 --> 4130.159000000001
eat

4128.4 --> 4134.96
garbage and

4130.159 --> 4136.5599999999995
dead meat and they absorb the mercury

4134.96 --> 4139.199
and the iodine

4136.56 --> 4140.4800000000005
and then it just yeah

4139.199 --> 4142.4
you get

4140.48 --> 4144.718999999999
very polluted

4142.4 --> 4144.719
heavy

4144.839 --> 4149.359
metals iodine can get people i don't

4147.52 --> 4151.279
know i have no idea what you're talking

4149.359 --> 4154.159000000001
about gadget inspector

4151.279 --> 4156.64
pure iodine is really good it doesn't

4154.159 --> 4157.44
get you upset

4156.64 --> 4160.08
but

4157.44 --> 4162.08
if you're not used to it especially if

4160.08 --> 4165.12
you've been deprived from iodine for a

4162.08 --> 4168.799
long time it can have a pretty dramatic

4165.12 --> 4170.88
impact on your metabolism at first

4168.799 --> 4175.04
and hey a dramatic impact on your

4170.88 --> 4175.839
metabolism can come with weird moods

4175.04 --> 4179.2789999999995
that's

4175.839 --> 4179.2789999999995
yeah happens a lot

4181.359 --> 4185.839
but no iodine

4183.44 --> 4187.2789999999995
generally does not get people upset i

4185.839 --> 4189.839
have no idea where you're getting that

4187.279 --> 4189.839000000001
from

4190.159 --> 4194.879999999999
unpolluted iodine is actually a great

4192.4 --> 4194.879999999999
blessing

4198.64 --> 4204.64
people can get allergic to iodine

4201.28 --> 4204.639999999999
i don't even believe that

4209.36 --> 4212.92
like how

4216.96 --> 4221.52
all right talking about which we're

4218.4 --> 4224.96
going to take some right now

4221.52 --> 4229.6
because iodine is freaking awesome right

4224.96 --> 4229.6
survivor shield x2 infowars store

4229.679 --> 4233.56
fantastic stuff

4257.52 --> 4260.56
just laugh

4259.28 --> 4262.639999999999
yeah

4260.56 --> 4265.76
no but i think he's i think gagi

4262.64 --> 4268.08
inspector's just mixing it up because

4265.76 --> 4270.56
yeah when iodine is not

4268.08 --> 4272.64
polluted it's very pure there is no

4270.56 --> 4275.360000000001
allergy there's no bad

4272.64 --> 4277.04
the bad reaction there might be yeah

4275.36 --> 4279.839999999999
your body going through a little

4277.04 --> 4282.56
revolution to clean things up

4279.84 --> 4284.2390000000005
but just iodine doesn't do that but yeah

4282.56 --> 4286.159000000001
if it's polluted

4284.239 --> 4289.12
and that often comes with other heavy

4286.159 --> 4291.199
metals that bind with it etc etc yeah

4289.12 --> 4294.159
polluted iodine yeah you can get all

4291.199 --> 4294.159
kinds of [ __ ] from that

4296.32 --> 4301.04
that's you but people can be like oh

4298.56 --> 4302.2390000000005
really give me a clear-cut example and

4301.04 --> 4304.4
then

4302.239 --> 4305.599999999999
exclude everything i just said get your

4304.4 --> 4307.759999999999
inspector

4305.6 --> 4308.96
cause you are wrong

4307.76 --> 4311.360000000001
you are

4308.96 --> 4312.32
wrong

4311.36 --> 4313.44
very

4312.32 --> 4315.84
very

4313.44 --> 4315.839999999999
wrong

4325.84 --> 4329.360000000001
so proof prove to me

4327.76 --> 4331.84
prove to me pure

4329.36 --> 4334.48
unbound clean iodine

4331.84 --> 4336.8
having allergy responses

4334.48 --> 4339.678999999999
now don't lull at me

4336.8 --> 4342.679
don't lull at me gadget inspector you're

4339.679 --> 4342.679
wrong

4343.199 --> 4348.879999999999
now prove to me that pure unadulterated

4347.04 --> 4351.5199999999995
iodine

4348.88 --> 4354.400000000001
is allergic to anybody

4351.52 --> 4357.52
buried not the polluted [ __ ] yeah and

4354.4 --> 4359.759999999999
there's lots of polluted [ __ ] too

4357.52 --> 4359.76
yeah

4360.08 --> 4364.239
so

4360.96 --> 4365.92
keep it specific yeah polluted iodine

4364.239 --> 4368.239
yeah can give you allergic response

4365.92 --> 4370.08
because it's not the iodine it's the

4368.239 --> 4373.08
other stuff that binds with it not the

4370.08 --> 4373.08
iodine

4389.28 --> 4392.28
do

4409.84 --> 4416.56
wow look if even cps can look it up and

4413.52 --> 4418.4800000000005
says it's not an allergen

4416.56 --> 4419.6
yeah

4418.48 --> 4420.959999999999
right so

4419.6 --> 4422.96
i don't know

4420.96 --> 4425.6
where you got the info from gadget

4422.96 --> 4427.6
inspector i really don't

4425.6 --> 4430.8
but i think that the person that told

4427.6 --> 4433.84
you didn't even realize themselves that

4430.8 --> 4436.88
they were dealing with pollution

4433.84 --> 4436.88
of iodine

4438.96 --> 4442.679
not pure iodine

4467.52 --> 4472.2390000000005
yeah well there you go george sanford

4469.6 --> 4473.1990000000005
thank you yeah exactly my point

4472.239 --> 4475.12
yeah

4473.199 --> 4476.96
if you're gonna if it's not pure iodine

4475.12 --> 4479.4
if you're mixing it up with other stuff

4476.96 --> 4482.2390000000005
or you're like on this weird chemical

4479.4 --> 4484.639999999999
pharmaceutical medication

4482.239 --> 4486.4
yeah the weird artificially chemically

4484.64 --> 4488.64
made [ __ ] and you have that in your

4486.4 --> 4490.4
system and you're going to pour iodine

4488.64 --> 4491.84
in with that as well

4490.4 --> 4495.12
guess what

4491.84 --> 4497.4400000000005
iodine is very reactive

4495.12 --> 4498.64
especially to certain like chemical

4497.44 --> 4499.839999999999
stuff

4498.64 --> 4501.280000000001
so

4499.84 --> 4503.84
yeah

4501.28 --> 4506.159
it might suddenly like change the

4503.84 --> 4507.84
specific chemical

4506.159 --> 4510.5599999999995
literally change it because of the

4507.84 --> 4512.2390000000005
binding as you take it with you yeah

4510.56 --> 4514.4800000000005
it's like yeah if you're gonna tr like

4512.239 --> 4517.28
oh let's destroy this antidepressant it

4514.48 --> 4518.718999999999
is anti-allergen medication and

4517.28 --> 4520.48
blood

4518.719 --> 4522.08
thinner and blah blah yeah and if you're

4520.48 --> 4524.718999999999
going to put it on that with that yeah

4522.08 --> 4527.36
yeah you might get a really really weird

4524.719 --> 4529.6
response because of that yeah

4527.36 --> 4531.04
but just the iodine

4529.6 --> 4534.4800000000005
no

4531.04 --> 4534.48
no it doesn't ever

4537.36 --> 4542.159
you get rashes yeah but that's uh that's

4539.52 --> 4546.2390000000005
the detoxification process i already

4542.159 --> 4546.239
told you gadget inspector

4546.32 --> 4551.12
you're losing my respect

4548.719 --> 4553.6
right now you really are you're losing

4551.12 --> 4557.599999999999
my respect i already told you

4553.6 --> 4559.280000000001
if you've never had iodine before

4557.6 --> 4563.280000000001
you take it

4559.28 --> 4566.0
you get a detox phase literal complete

4563.28 --> 4568.5599999999995
overhaul of your metabolical workings

4566.0 --> 4571.52
inside it completely changes because of

4568.56 --> 4573.6
the dramatic impact that iodine has in a

4571.52 --> 4574.64
positive sense

4573.6 --> 4577.4400000000005
it

4574.64 --> 4580.96
enables all kinds of processes to

4577.44 --> 4582.879999999999
suddenly start running

4580.96 --> 4584.0
that over time without it kind of like

4582.88 --> 4586.56
die down

4584.0 --> 4588.56
so yeah then suddenly you might have a

4586.56 --> 4590.8
sudden purge right because if you don't

4588.56 --> 4594.4800000000005
take iodine in any form

4590.8 --> 4598.0
it's gonna fill up with other halogens

4594.48 --> 4598.0
that are not as good for you

4598.48 --> 4602.239
right

4600.08 --> 4604.239
your system will use those types of

4602.239 --> 4606.48
halogen as a replacement because it

4604.239 --> 4608.239
really needs a halogen

4606.48 --> 4610.32
if you then take iodine then suddenly

4608.239 --> 4612.718999999999
it's going to be like oh my god finally

4610.32 --> 4613.599999999999
this [ __ ] okay let's chug all those

4612.719 --> 4616.64
other

4613.6 --> 4618.08
halogens out of there and that's

4616.64 --> 4620.159000000001
gonna give

4618.08 --> 4622.719
unpleasant experiences and even like

4620.159 --> 4624.4
rashes or sudden like you start

4622.719 --> 4626.56
i've heard people

4624.4 --> 4627.839999999999
that would like start to sweat brown

4626.56 --> 4629.360000000001
[ __ ]

4627.84 --> 4632.8
creepy

4629.36 --> 4634.32
that's detox that's a detox response

4632.8 --> 4638.719
that's not

4634.32 --> 4641.84
the iodine that's the iodine replacing

4638.719 --> 4644.8
toxins that are then being expelled it

4641.84 --> 4648.56
makes you uncomfortable it doesn't last

4644.8 --> 4650.8
after that period it stops you'll never

4648.56 --> 4652.88
have that again

4650.8 --> 4654.56
unless you deprive yourself completely

4652.88 --> 4657.4400000000005
from iodine for another 10 years

4654.56 --> 4658.8
straight then you might have it again

4657.44 --> 4661.04
alright

4658.8 --> 4662.320000000001
have we gotten that cleared up gadget

4661.04 --> 4664.239
inspector

4662.32 --> 4667.36
don't laugh like a funny or i'm gonna

4664.239 --> 4667.36
take your wrench away

4671.12 --> 4675.92
this is not funny you can't tell people

4673.679 --> 4677.4400000000005
you you have allergic responses to

4675.92 --> 4678.4
iodine because that is technically

4677.44 --> 4682.08
incorrect

4678.4 --> 4682.08
and iodine is a great blessing

4684.0 --> 4688.96
yeah

4686.0 --> 4691.6
that's that's just like telling

4688.96 --> 4694.4800000000005
a really fat person that's eaten super

4691.6 --> 4695.84
unhealthy and like sugar bars and

4694.48 --> 4698.159
crappy

4695.84 --> 4699.84
food and then oh i'm gonna

4698.159 --> 4702.5599999999995
i'm gonna train i'm gonna get all that

4699.84 --> 4704.2390000000005
fat off me right and then they get a

4702.56 --> 4707.76
heart attack

4704.239 --> 4711.04
no vax necessary right why

4707.76 --> 4713.04
because suddenly all that garbage poison

4711.04 --> 4715.36
that came with the candy and [ __ ] they

4713.04 --> 4717.04
stored in their body suddenly gets

4715.36 --> 4719.679
released

4717.04 --> 4721.04
and then it's like ah

4719.679 --> 4722.4
poison

4721.04 --> 4726.08
cramp

4722.4 --> 4728.4
bad [ __ ] and they get a heart attack

4726.08 --> 4730.32
that's not because sporting gives you a

4728.4 --> 4732.96
heart attack that's because sudden

4730.32 --> 4735.199
release of toxins in your system can

4732.96 --> 4738.32
have a dramatic impact

4735.199 --> 4738.32
on your physiology

4738.719 --> 4744.4800000000005
iodine can do that because it

4742.159 --> 4746.719
might if you've not if you haven't had

4744.48 --> 4749.599999999999
it in like a long long time it might

4746.719 --> 4751.84
suddenly start a detox process that will

4749.6 --> 4753.1990000000005
expel the other halogens from your

4751.84 --> 4756.8
system

4753.199 --> 4759.28
and that can come with discomfort

4756.8 --> 4761.28
even like like experience sickness like

4759.28 --> 4764.639999999999
nausea all kinds of things

4761.28 --> 4766.639999999999
but that doesn't last long

4764.64 --> 4769.280000000001
after a while it's out of your system

4766.64 --> 4772.0
and then you are clean

4769.28 --> 4772.0
and clear

4772.159 --> 4781.04
right get it right that's not allergy

4775.679 --> 4781.04
to iodine alright nobody has that

4781.36 --> 4786.639999999999
that's actually it's the opposite

4784.0 --> 4789.12
it's suddenly the bad halogens being

4786.64 --> 4790.96
expelled in your blood and you getting

4789.12 --> 4793.679
sick from that

4790.96 --> 4795.36
not the iodine

4793.679 --> 4798.0
have we got that can we get that

4795.36 --> 4802.32
straight gadget inspector can we get

4798.0 --> 4802.32
that straight can you please retract

4802.8 --> 4808.08
that iodine is allergic

4805.84 --> 4810.719
can you please retract that in my chat

4808.08 --> 4810.719
now thanks

4816.239 --> 4821.28
oh he said he had an overdose of iron

4819.199 --> 4822.879999999999
well then he's just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

4821.28 --> 4826.4
have you ever considered that he doesn't

4822.88 --> 4826.400000000001
know what the [ __ ] he's talking about

4830.88 --> 4836.2390000000005
seafood platter

4832.719 --> 4837.76
oh yeah so now we're talking again about

4836.239 --> 4841.36
iodine

4837.76 --> 4843.360000000001
from shellfish seafood yeah yeah guess

4841.36 --> 4847.12
what happens

4843.36 --> 4849.599999999999
mixed iodine not pure iodine

4847.12 --> 4852.159
bound iodine with all kinds of other

4849.6 --> 4853.76
stuff including mercury

4852.159 --> 4855.759999999999
not good for you

4853.76 --> 4858.320000000001
did you pay any attention to what i've

4855.76 --> 4862.0
been saying the last 15 minutes at all

4858.32 --> 4866.48
gadget inspector oh the hospital said it

4862.0 --> 4867.84
the hospital said oh wow

4866.48 --> 4870.4
yeah

4867.84 --> 4872.96
oh like the hospital says that you need

4870.4 --> 4875.599999999999
ram deserver being put artificially in a

4872.96 --> 4877.84
coma if you if you get a breathing

4875.6 --> 4880.639
problem and then you die

4877.84 --> 4882.56
that hospital said it did they

4880.639 --> 4885.679
candid inspector

4882.56 --> 4888.639
the hospital told you that iodine is bad

4885.679 --> 4891.52
oh well the hospital you know they're so

4888.639 --> 4892.56
reliable

4891.52 --> 4894.88
like

4892.56 --> 4894.88
that's

4896.0 --> 4900.84
jeez relax no you're getting a timeout

4899.84 --> 4902.8
i'm not

4900.84 --> 4907.28
relaxing

4902.8 --> 4907.28
i'm combating medical misinformation

4907.44 --> 4911.799999999999
that's not geez relax

4924.4 --> 4929.36
so you can react to iodine bad iodine

4927.12 --> 4933.28
yeah

4929.36 --> 4936.0
if the iodine is bound to something else

4933.28 --> 4941.199
then it's not pure iodine it's bound

4936.0 --> 4944.0
iodine what it's bound to changes it

4941.199 --> 4947.5199999999995
it tends to bind to things that are not

4944.0 --> 4947.52
really good for you

4948.8 --> 4955.08
so yeah polluted iodine bad pure iodine

4952.08 --> 4955.08
good

4960.159 --> 4964.0
you can overdose on any yeah

4964.159 --> 4968.32
yeah you don't need like huge vast

4966.88 --> 4971.36
quantities of it

4968.32 --> 4971.36
just need enough

4971.679 --> 4976.4800000000005
and besides if you take it it does like

4974.48 --> 4978.959999999999
really sit

4976.48 --> 4980.799999999999
it just takes its place in your system

4978.96 --> 4984.159
and then it lasts

4980.8 --> 4986.8
quite quite some time

4984.159 --> 4988.719
yup of course right so not allergy to

4986.8 --> 4992.2390000000005
iodine then

4988.719 --> 4995.679
can i can i get the confirmation

4992.239 --> 4998.48
there is no iodine allergy it's not

4995.679 --> 5001.76
allergy to iodine it's not allergy to

4998.48 --> 5004.239
iodine that doesn't exist

5001.76 --> 5006.400000000001
it's not iodine allergy it's

5004.239 --> 5007.5199999999995
pollution

5006.4 --> 5010.5599999999995
allergy

5007.52 --> 5013.76
iodine binds to things that you can get

5010.56 --> 5015.360000000001
allergic to or can have like bad

5013.76 --> 5018.2390000000005
reactions to

5015.36 --> 5020.239
it's not the iodine it's what the iodine

5018.239 --> 5022.799999999999
can bind to

5020.239 --> 5024.638999999999
so if you eat bound iodine yeah then you

5022.8 --> 5025.92
might risk

5024.639 --> 5029.04
getting

5025.92 --> 5032.679
like bad responses that doesn't happen

5029.04 --> 5032.679
with pure iodine

5058.56 --> 5060.8
uh

5069.92 --> 5074.8
okay tony that's hilarious

5072.56 --> 5076.080000000001
that wouldn't fall under allergy either

5074.8 --> 5078.320000000001
but if

5076.08 --> 5081.12
theoretically

5078.32 --> 5083.92
yeah you could be like

5081.12 --> 5086.32
so suppressed by just nerve suppressing

5083.92 --> 5088.8
substances and

5086.32 --> 5090.96
like in pharmaceutical or just like

5088.8 --> 5094.08
eating

5090.96 --> 5094.08
too much sugar

5095.199 --> 5098.96
garbage eating garbage and then that

5097.36 --> 5100.719
literally numbs you down you drink

5098.96 --> 5103.12
fluoridated word it numbs you down and

5100.719 --> 5104.719
you're like yeah then you don't sense so

5103.12 --> 5106.96
much right

5104.719 --> 5108.32
if you then suddenly get detoxed from

5106.96 --> 5110.639
all that

5108.32 --> 5112.48
and you're confronted with who you are

5110.639 --> 5114.96
and what the [ __ ] you've done with your

5112.48 --> 5119.28
life and what you really feel

5114.96 --> 5120.8
yeah that the stress reaction from that

5119.28 --> 5123.759999999999
can be bad

5120.8 --> 5123.76
right stress

5124.56 --> 5129.76
and all that it's not the iodine though

5127.36 --> 5129.759999999999
again

5133.28 --> 5139.8
you can be allergic to water though i

5135.36 --> 5139.799999999999
don't that doesn't make any sense

5143.199 --> 5148.08
we're consistent of like 90 water so

5145.92 --> 5152.6
that that's

5148.08 --> 5152.6
that's nonsensical akuma virus

5154.0 --> 5159.96
like if that were technically true you'd

5155.76 --> 5159.96
literally be dead instantly

5191.92 --> 5197.1990000000005
well yeah tone that's interesting yes

5194.8 --> 5200.0
people can

5197.199 --> 5203.678999999999
create psychosomatic reactions because

5200.0 --> 5205.84
of the anticipation of an allergy

5203.679 --> 5209.96
you can literally trigger your own

5205.84 --> 5209.96
allergies through psychosomatics

5210.32 --> 5214.32
crazy

5211.28 --> 5214.32
but it's it's true

5215.04 --> 5217.92
so if you're constantly like oh i'm

5216.639 --> 5219.6
going to be allergic reaction you're

5217.92 --> 5221.679
going to be in the religion yeah yeah

5219.6 --> 5223.280000000001
then that actually enhances the

5221.679 --> 5226.2390000000005
likelihood you'll get an allergic

5223.28 --> 5227.92
reaction even if you didn't do the thing

5226.239 --> 5232.28
that would give it to you

5227.92 --> 5232.28
because of pure psychosomatics

5235.36 --> 5239.839999999999
another example of placebo effect yeah

5280.639 --> 5284.639
if you worry about getting sick you get

5282.4 --> 5284.638999999999
sick

5284.719 --> 5287.04
right

5288.719 --> 5293.96
right

5290.32 --> 5293.96
yeah that can happen

5298.08 --> 5302.159
allergic to the toxins in water

5302.4 --> 5306.5599999999995
i don't know about the water allergy

5304.08 --> 5309.6
thing i i don't really want to

5306.56 --> 5312.400000000001
move into that

5309.6 --> 5315.1990000000005
i think that requires very specific like

5312.4 --> 5315.199
a weird

5315.36 --> 5321.04
vaccination [ __ ] and then because that

5318.96 --> 5323.679
nobody

5321.04 --> 5326.639
just becomes water allergic nobody

5323.679 --> 5326.639
that's ridiculous

5330.159 --> 5334.32
you've got to do something really bad

5332.719 --> 5337.84
for you

5334.32 --> 5337.84
to get to that

5342.4 --> 5345.44
yeah nobody cares like

5349.36 --> 5353.92
i'm allergic to allergies stay away from

5351.679 --> 5353.92
them

5356.32 --> 5360.5599999999995
well i'm allergic to people

5358.56 --> 5362.400000000001
like personally whining about their

5360.56 --> 5364.88
allergies

5362.4 --> 5365.759999999999
and that by the way included my mother a

5364.88 --> 5369.1990000000005
lot

5365.76 --> 5371.52
it was very annoying

5369.199 --> 5374.4
because i'm a poor me

5371.52 --> 5376.2390000000005
and it always would just make it worse

5374.4 --> 5379.239
just complaining about only makes it

5376.239 --> 5379.239
worse

5384.239 --> 5389.0
allergic to spheres oh that was

5386.0 --> 5389.0
problematic

5407.36 --> 5414.32
no living thing is allergic to your one

5409.92 --> 5417.28
like are you talking to me omega genesis

5414.32 --> 5417.28
are you talking to me

5417.76 --> 5421.2390000000005
i hope not

5430.08 --> 5433.239
all right

5445.04 --> 5450.8
you an organism is unpredictable what

5449.12 --> 5452.239
i know what you mean but i totally

5450.8 --> 5455.92
disagree though i think the human

5452.239 --> 5457.5199999999995
organism is extremely predictable

5455.92 --> 5459.84
it's just

5457.52 --> 5459.84
very

5460.84 --> 5468.679
elaborate but yeah that's more like a

5464.719 --> 5468.679
angle of approach thing

5483.44 --> 5490.28
allergic to corn virus okay well then it

5486.0 --> 5490.28
makes sense that you haven't blocked

5497.6 --> 5501.639
all right i'll be back two minutes

5523.92 --> 5526.92
so

5594.0 --> 5597.56
right so

5602.159 --> 5607.08
what are you guys talking about now

5624.719 --> 5626.96
huh

5627.44 --> 5631.759999999999
right yeah one for the unit that's

5629.52 --> 5633.679
interesting yeah yeah

5631.76 --> 5636.400000000001
now of course psychosomatics very

5633.679 --> 5637.36
important so if you're healthy realize

5636.4 --> 5640.159
it

5637.36 --> 5641.839999999999
be thankful for it like

5640.159 --> 5644.719
put

5641.84 --> 5647.76
extra good energy through your intention

5644.719 --> 5650.88
on your well-working system

5647.76 --> 5652.400000000001
energize it with positive intention

5650.88 --> 5655.52
and that will help

5652.4 --> 5657.44
absolutely it will stabilize reinforce

5655.52 --> 5660.8
you

5657.44 --> 5664.48
make it stronger make it more dynamic in

5660.8 --> 5666.8
the face of adversity even yes

5664.48 --> 5670.0
totally agree with that one for the unit

5666.8 --> 5670.0
interesting that jesus would

5670.159 --> 5673.839999999999
put it in that context

5719.28 --> 5723.679
ah get inspector

5722.4 --> 5725.04
uh

5723.679 --> 5727.52
using

5725.04 --> 5730.4
a kumu virus is an easy scapegoat not

5727.52 --> 5732.8
too long ago you said

5730.4 --> 5735.04
the hospital told you

5732.8 --> 5737.679
that somebody had an allergic reaction

5735.04 --> 5740.08
to iodine and you were talking about it

5737.679 --> 5743.08
for quite some time as if you believed

5740.08 --> 5743.08
it

5744.8 --> 5748.719
don't think i'm gonna forget about that

5746.48 --> 5751.839999999999
just because a kumu virus and even more

5748.719 --> 5754.32
delusional if individual is in the chat

5751.84 --> 5754.32
right now

5755.199 --> 5759.919999999999
not saying you're overall delusional but

5757.44 --> 5762.4
you were definitely you

5759.92 --> 5764.4800000000005
you were resting on a

5762.4 --> 5767.759999999999
a piece of false information i've had

5764.48 --> 5771.44
that too in in my past life a lot

5767.76 --> 5773.679
a lot when i was really young but i've

5771.44 --> 5777.44
i've like

5773.679 --> 5777.4400000000005
combed it clean since then

5777.84 --> 5783.639
i believed a lot of wrong things right

5780.639 --> 5783.639
anyway

5785.6 --> 5789.92
at least you didn't hold on to it

5788.4 --> 5793.679
tightly

5789.92 --> 5796.4
there's no is right because i heard it

5793.679 --> 5797.76
some at least you didn't do that

5796.4 --> 5800.08
like the

5797.76 --> 5802.400000000001
the other guy

5800.08 --> 5805.44
boy what the hell was his name whining

5802.4 --> 5805.44
on about veganism

5809.679 --> 5815.679
was this good

5812.8 --> 5815.679
andrew boy

5818.48 --> 5823.5199999999995
akuma virus shut up

5820.639 --> 5823.52
stupid clown

5823.84 --> 5828.4800000000005
you're not funny you're not even welcome

5826.239 --> 5828.48
here

5837.84 --> 5843.32
anyone watch zoom truth video no

5858.8 --> 5863.1990000000005
brain scan too much identities that's

5861.92 --> 5866.08
crazy

5863.199 --> 5868.48
why would they say that

5866.08 --> 5872.5599999999995
like

5868.48 --> 5872.5599999999995
unless like they had some weird

5872.639 --> 5878.08
iodine with something else specific

5875.76 --> 5881.04
mixture to do the scan

5878.08 --> 5881.04
and iodine

5881.6 --> 5887.1990000000005
bromine or whatever something

5884.56 --> 5890.400000000001
combined compound that they would just

5887.199 --> 5894.199
call iodine right

5890.4 --> 5894.199
i don't know the details

5897.76 --> 5900.8
but

5898.48 --> 5903.759999999999
i'm pretty damn sure they don't just

5900.8 --> 5905.4400000000005
like pour pure iodine into you for like

5903.76 --> 5910.639
brain scans like

5905.44 --> 5912.96
no no they don't they just don't do that

5910.639 --> 5915.1990000000005
that's not what they do when they do

5912.96 --> 5918.639
that

5915.199 --> 5921.759999999999
so if they just call it iodine

5918.639 --> 5925.4800000000005
it's not just pure iodine can't be

5921.76 --> 5925.4800000000005
that's not what they use

5939.6 --> 5944.400000000001
yeah yeah consuming too much iodine yeah

5942.32 --> 5947.44
yeah it does like over stimulate your

5944.4 --> 5947.44
thyroid that's right

5947.679 --> 5952.6
of course yeah taking too much is not

5949.6 --> 5952.6
good

5959.679 --> 5964.08
what happens when people take identity

5962.4 --> 5965.92
to improve their thyroid function yeah

5964.08 --> 5968.159
right because there's been lots of talk

5965.92 --> 5969.4400000000005
about that like oh why am you why are

5968.159 --> 5972.159
you fat

5969.44 --> 5973.678999999999
it's because i have an inactive thyroid

5972.159 --> 5975.36
gland

5973.679 --> 5977.679
it's not because i eat the freaking

5975.36 --> 5979.679
sugar bars like every day and i just

5977.679 --> 5981.28
don't tell anybody keep it a secret

5979.679 --> 5985.0
because i don't want to give up my

5981.28 --> 5985.0
little snack habits

5999.44 --> 6005.678999999999
i was told i didn't use you you're right

6003.199 --> 6008.4
well look

6005.679 --> 6010.719
hospital procedures including with scans

6008.4 --> 6013.839999999999
you can actually look that up

6010.719 --> 6017.36
like what it is exactly that they do

6013.84 --> 6021.28
probably through pubmed or

6017.36 --> 6023.679
like these protocols are written down

6021.28 --> 6024.88
and then they're get very they get very

6023.679 --> 6027.76
specific

6024.88 --> 6029.679
as to what they use exactly

6027.76 --> 6032.96
right so you could look it up they might

6029.679 --> 6035.1990000000005
just call it iodine

6032.96 --> 6037.84
it's not actually iodine it's very

6035.199 --> 6039.599999999999
unlikely that would have been just pure

6037.84 --> 6041.119000000001
iodine like that's

6039.6 --> 6044.08
like what

6041.119 --> 6044.08
and don't do that

6046.4 --> 6051.28
dude if they just pour pure iodine into

6049.04 --> 6052.88
you when you get a brain scan dude i

6051.28 --> 6054.48
would just go to the hospital can i have

6052.88 --> 6056.639
a brain scan

6054.48 --> 6059.599999999999
i'm here for the iodine

6056.639 --> 6059.6
if you know what i mean

6062.8 --> 6068.639
i iodine one two three

6065.84 --> 6071.52
one two three four five

6068.639 --> 6073.04
okay so they use a very specific type of

6071.52 --> 6075.280000000001
iodine

6073.04 --> 6077.36
because iodine is an element so what is

6075.28 --> 6081.04
this iodine one two three that doesn't

6077.36 --> 6084.28
sound like the pure iodine element

6081.04 --> 6084.28
my point

6094.4 --> 6100.0
oysters yet yeah what already said

6097.119 --> 6100.0
i already told you

6105.76 --> 6109.6
i don't know well

6107.679 --> 6112.8
trust me on this

6109.6 --> 6115.84
i do know i know i know this i know how

6112.8 --> 6118.159000000001
this work i know it's not the iodine

6115.84 --> 6123.52
it's not pure iodine it's not pure

6118.159 --> 6125.839999999999
iodine now if you go into a detox phase

6123.52 --> 6126.639
because you just started taking it

6125.84 --> 6129.92
then

6126.639 --> 6132.08
in that detox phase your body is busy

6129.92 --> 6135.679
replacing the halogens

6132.08 --> 6138.159
with the iodine now if you then suddenly

6135.679 --> 6140.639
during that process

6138.159 --> 6141.92
right in the middle of that process

6140.639 --> 6145.36
start eating

6141.92 --> 6147.28
another source of iodine that is

6145.36 --> 6149.759999999999
polluted

6147.28 --> 6151.92
then maybe weird [ __ ] could happen

6149.76 --> 6154.639
because your body is in the middle of

6151.92 --> 6156.88
processing replacing the halogens with

6154.639 --> 6158.88
the pure iodine now if certainly during

6156.88 --> 6161.76
that replacement other

6158.88 --> 6163.92
polluted iodine start mixing in right in

6161.76 --> 6165.52
the middle of that process well maybe

6163.92 --> 6169.119
that could be

6165.52 --> 6170.719
lead to pretty bad reactions like

6169.119 --> 6173.04
i don't know

6170.719 --> 6174.4
i don't know for sure i see that as

6173.04 --> 6176.639
likely

6174.4 --> 6178.4
right

6176.639 --> 6179.76
it's not

6178.4 --> 6182.48
the pure

6179.76 --> 6186.0
iodine and i want you to get that into

6182.48 --> 6188.638999999999
your head gadget inspector it's not

6186.0 --> 6192.639
pure iodine

6188.639 --> 6192.639
that doesn't do that

6194.48 --> 6198.5599999999995
so we are both right

6196.96 --> 6199.92
yeah

6198.56 --> 6201.76
except

6199.92 --> 6204.4
you

6201.76 --> 6205.92
yeah you described it incorrectly

6204.4 --> 6210.239
or

6205.92 --> 6210.2390000000005
it was described to you incorrectly

6212.88 --> 6216.2390000000005
no it's not entirely true if it was

6214.56 --> 6218.719
iodine one two three then it is

6216.239 --> 6222.44
technically iodine it's just not pure

6218.719 --> 6222.44
iodine for consumption

6236.08 --> 6239.92
antiseptic during operations now that's

6239.119 --> 6242.159
like

6239.92 --> 6245.28
iodine you put on wounds right that's

6242.159 --> 6247.04
not pure iodine that's bound iodine with

6245.28 --> 6250.0
another substance and that makes it

6247.04 --> 6254.8
smell a lot i don't remember what is

6250.0 --> 6254.8
bound with but that's not pure iodine

6255.199 --> 6262.96
that stuff is pure iodine it's it's like

6260.0 --> 6266.88
mixed in with some kind of

6262.96 --> 6269.84
coconut oil extract it works really well

6266.88 --> 6272.400000000001
to keep it pure and unbound and make it

6269.84 --> 6274.719
last make it not dissolve into air

6272.4 --> 6277.759999999999
because pure iodine crystal actually

6274.719 --> 6280.4800000000005
just dissolves into air

6277.76 --> 6283.280000000001
right but the whole trick is how to make

6280.48 --> 6284.4
it not dissolve into air because it's

6283.28 --> 6287.599999999999
pure

6284.4 --> 6289.679
and not binded in a bad way

6287.6 --> 6290.96
so it doesn't become polluted that's the

6289.679 --> 6293.28
trick and

6290.96 --> 6295.119
all the laboratory guys

6293.28 --> 6296.8
that infowars work

6295.119 --> 6297.759999999999
with i think it's like doctor group or

6296.8 --> 6299.92
something

6297.76 --> 6302.08
they figured out a really good mix to do

6299.92 --> 6305.6
that and that's what i've been using for

6302.08 --> 6305.6
years now and worked great

6307.119 --> 6312.719
and it's deep crystal iodine so this is

6309.28 --> 6314.4
not from extracted from ocean sources

6312.719 --> 6315.76
this iodine

6314.4 --> 6320.159
is literally

6315.76 --> 6320.159000000001
a side product it's like what

6320.48 --> 6323.28
oil

6322.0 --> 6328.08
drillers

6323.28 --> 6330.48
sometimes bump into pockets of iodine

6328.08 --> 6333.5199999999995
that's where this is coming from

6330.48 --> 6336.159
so it is pure iodine crystal it's the

6333.52 --> 6338.4800000000005
most unpolluted you can find because

6336.159 --> 6340.5599999999995
that's always the issue

6338.48 --> 6343.28
how much pollution is it once it gets

6340.56 --> 6346.400000000001
bound through pollution it's very hard

6343.28 --> 6346.4
to unbind it

6352.239 --> 6355.44
what is iodine where does it come from

6353.92 --> 6357.76
it's a halogen

6355.44 --> 6360.719
and it's

6357.76 --> 6360.719
it's in the earth

6361.92 --> 6366.119
there's just pockets of it

6381.84 --> 6386.0
that would be a nice thing to know at

6383.76 --> 6390.400000000001
the beginning of this conversation

6386.0 --> 6393.04
what the point spheres are pointless

6390.4 --> 6396.5599999999995
that's technically correct

6393.04 --> 6396.56
there's no point on the sphere

6399.04 --> 6404.48
has obviously studied either and yeah

6401.92 --> 6404.4800000000005
i have

6404.96 --> 6407.199
like

6407.36 --> 6412.159
it helped me a great deal because

6410.56 --> 6415.119000000001
i was

6412.159 --> 6417.5199999999995
haunted by nightmares and concentra

6415.119 --> 6420.0
severe concentration problem not like

6417.52 --> 6422.56
super severe not that i just couldn't

6420.0 --> 6425.84
focus at all when i would get headaches

6422.56 --> 6429.04
very easily from trying to focus

6425.84 --> 6430.96
i don't have that anymore

6429.04 --> 6432.48
now i have other

6430.96 --> 6434.56
issues that get in the way but they're

6432.48 --> 6436.799999999999
not issues in my brain they're more like

6434.56 --> 6439.52
my organs not being able to handle

6436.8 --> 6443.76
certain levels of tension

6439.52 --> 6446.080000000001
but ever since i've used iodine

6443.76 --> 6448.88
everything's been great

6446.08 --> 6450.5599999999995
i'm so much more clear minded

6448.88 --> 6451.6
so much more it's

6450.56 --> 6454.639
like

6451.6 --> 6456.88
50 percent better

6454.639 --> 6459.1990000000005
and that's even compared to when i was

6456.88 --> 6461.6
really young and like

6459.199 --> 6465.199
thriving with energy

6461.6 --> 6468.8
i'm better now than then

6465.199 --> 6468.799999999999
even though i have less energy

6469.28 --> 6474.159
so yeah iodine it's really good but you

6472.32 --> 6475.759999999999
got to have it pure

6474.159 --> 6478.0
and you got to realize that if you've

6475.76 --> 6479.84
never taken it before it's very likely

6478.0 --> 6482.88
you'll go into the

6479.84 --> 6485.4400000000005
halogen replacement process

6482.88 --> 6487.4400000000005
that the detox process

6485.44 --> 6488.5599999999995
and that can be very unpleasant the

6487.44 --> 6490.638999999999
first time

6488.56 --> 6493.04
and you got to be careful not to

6490.639 --> 6494.719
mix it in with like don't start eating

6493.04 --> 6496.56
shell food or something right when

6494.719 --> 6498.4800000000005
you're in the middle of that detox

6496.56 --> 6501.360000000001
process it's bad news

6498.48 --> 6501.36
you got to be careful

6501.76 --> 6505.76
and then once when it's over after that

6504.0 --> 6507.76
point yeah then it doesn't really matter

6505.76 --> 6510.08
anymore then it's all replaced and all

6507.76 --> 6512.4800000000005
the the bad halogens have been expelled

6510.08 --> 6515.04
and replaced with the iodine and then

6512.48 --> 6515.04
you're good

6515.119 --> 6520.32
then your body isn't going to out of

6517.6 --> 6522.88
desperation assimilate bad halogens

6520.32 --> 6524.799999999999
anymore because it's it's filled up you

6522.88 --> 6526.159000000001
see

6524.8 --> 6529.84
and if it's in the middle of the

6526.159 --> 6529.839999999999
replacement process yeah then

6530.0 --> 6533.84
yeah

6531.36 --> 6535.04
don't take polluted iodine while you're

6533.84 --> 6536.96
in that

6535.04 --> 6539.36
anyway i'm gonna round out the show man
