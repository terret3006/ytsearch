[Music]

64.08 --> 66.479
good

65.439 --> 68.83999999999999
morning

66.479 --> 72.08
welcome to flat earth early bird number

68.84 --> 73.84
990 i'm your host irwin and before i

72.08 --> 76.0
start the show

73.84 --> 78.479
please don't forget to share it on any

76.0 --> 80.479
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

78.479 --> 82.64
already subscribe to my channel hit the

80.479 --> 85.67999999999999
bell notification so you don't want to

82.64 --> 87.84
go live which is normally 1 pm amsterdam

85.68 --> 90.32000000000001
time in the weekdays and 2 pm amsterdam

87.84 --> 92.72
time in the weekend and please also do

90.32 --> 94.72
support me through the paypal patreon

92.72 --> 96.4
crypto wallet super chat and membership

94.72 --> 100.2
system join button

96.4 --> 100.2
that would be much appreciated

101.119 --> 105.119
right

102.799 --> 107.92
yeah the weather today is

105.119 --> 107.92
turned around

113.36 --> 117.92
weather yesterday did kind of go as i

115.28 --> 120.32000000000001
expected and predicted

117.92 --> 124.399
but yeah today it's kind of cleared up i

120.32 --> 124.39899999999999
think it cleared up somewhere this night

126.56 --> 130.64000000000001
i have some moon involvements

134.08 --> 140.64000000000001
but yeah it's suddenly turned in this

137.84 --> 142.879
nice and clear skies

140.64 --> 145.76
not too windy

142.879 --> 147.92
fluffy little clouds

145.76 --> 150.92
and shiny sun

147.92 --> 150.92
monday

159.44 --> 162.07999999999998
pretty sweet

169.36 --> 171.84
no

175.44 --> 177.92
all right

179.12 --> 183.36
so yeah it is monday

181.92 --> 186.48
let's see what the temperature is i

183.36 --> 186.48000000000002
haven't checked that yet

188.64 --> 192.64
21 degrees right

191.04 --> 194.07999999999998
makes sense

192.64 --> 195.83999999999997
feels like that

194.08 --> 196.84
nice and warm not

195.84 --> 198.56
not

196.84 --> 201.20000000000002
cooking

198.56 --> 204.239
just nice

201.2 --> 207.67999999999998
let's not celebrate too soon

204.239 --> 207.68
what do you mean return to normal

209.44 --> 212.92
first in chat

219.2 --> 222.39999999999998
oh the 2k thing

223.28 --> 226.879
right

224.48 --> 230.23899999999998
yeah i did actually officially hit that

226.879 --> 230.239
mark but yeah

231.76 --> 239.67999999999998
i remember the data from previous

235.2 --> 241.76
events like this and as expected

239.68 --> 245.0
they're rolling it back again so now i'm

241.76 --> 245.0
at 1998.

246.0 --> 249.519
they love to play these silly little

247.68 --> 252.959
troll games

249.519 --> 254.72
because they can and they are that petty

252.959 --> 257.28000000000003
and that's fine with me that's why i'm

254.72 --> 259.04
not like being like oh my god

257.28 --> 261.19899999999996
i learned my lessons

259.04 --> 262.96000000000004
right from the previous times it just

261.199 --> 265.6
doesn't matter anymore

262.96 --> 265.59999999999997
not really

267.12 --> 270.72
only 10 shows to go

269.6 --> 274.8
right

270.72 --> 274.8
well they can't take that away or well

275.199 --> 279.52000000000004
maybe they could

277.52 --> 283.84
i'll just continue somewhere else then

279.52 --> 283.84
right they can't stop me from counting

287.28 --> 290.71999999999997
right no i'm

288.639 --> 293.28000000000003
look what matters to me is the people

290.72 --> 295.28000000000003
that are in my chat because

293.28 --> 297.44
i don't know how many other people have

295.28 --> 298.479
kind of studied my show and how this

297.44 --> 300.88
works

298.479 --> 303.84
but that's really how it works

300.88 --> 307.28
i i kind of announce it it is like

303.84 --> 308.32
on purpose i seek out that

307.28 --> 311.039
format

308.32 --> 312.71999999999997
that thing and that includes by the way

311.039 --> 315.039
the silence right

312.72 --> 317.6
i'm not prioritizing keeping some

315.039 --> 318.88
blabbering cycle going which is what

317.6 --> 321.36
most people

318.88 --> 323.28
that do live streams and regular media

321.36 --> 326.0
fans really end up doing

323.28 --> 327.35999999999996
i'm on purpose avoiding that basically

326.0 --> 329.759
allowing

327.36 --> 332.08000000000004
what is on average i guess considered as

329.759 --> 335.68
an embarrassment

332.08 --> 335.68
to keep continuing because

336.08 --> 339.52
i'm just

337.36 --> 341.199
allowing that

339.52 --> 343.19899999999996
i i don't know maybe it's like

341.199 --> 345.91900000000004
triggering maybe that

343.199 --> 348.479
keeps me away from a certain level that

345.919 --> 350.639
would launch me on the wider platforms

348.479 --> 352.56
perhaps and maybe that is why i'm doing

350.639 --> 356.16
it to avoid that on purpose

352.56 --> 356.16
because i want the development

357.199 --> 363.039
right

359.44 --> 363.919
i want the development i want ascension

363.039 --> 366.71999999999997
for

363.919 --> 370.31899999999996
the entire spectrum

366.72 --> 373.03900000000004
like even for those that have fallen

370.319 --> 374.639
very deeply in their life

373.039 --> 376.639
right because when that happens you

374.639 --> 379.919
don't think you can ever get out

376.639 --> 383.6
and you can't reach anybody anymore in

379.919 --> 383.59999999999997
order to find courage

383.84 --> 389.52
and that's something that i lacked

385.68 --> 389.52
severely in my life in ways

391.68 --> 396.88
but i

393.44 --> 396.88
for whatever happened

397.44 --> 403.039
i am here i have grown out of it i've

400.08 --> 406.24
had pretty bizarre

403.039 --> 408.31899999999996
time intertwinement

406.24 --> 410.479
experiences

408.319 --> 413.199
through my visions

410.479 --> 414.31899999999996
and it is at least interesting

413.199 --> 416.96000000000004
you know

414.319 --> 419.28000000000003
like if i can't do my life right

416.96 --> 422.08
according to what i want then at least i

419.28 --> 425.599
can

422.08 --> 425.599
an interesting study out of it

426.08 --> 430.8
because

427.84 --> 433.19899999999996
psychology and consciousness

430.8 --> 435.52000000000004
right we can derive the mechanisms but

433.199 --> 438.639
that doesn't necessarily mean that

435.52 --> 441.52
those derived mechanisms will be

438.639 --> 443.84000000000003
at the control of the consciousness

441.52 --> 447.75899999999996
itself

443.84 --> 450.56
usually it ends up just being a tool

447.759 --> 451.52000000000004
and in the end for the ego

450.56 --> 453.28000000000003
to

451.52 --> 456.08
exert your will

453.28 --> 459.11999999999995
right instead of finding deeper

456.08 --> 462.24
understanding deeper connections

459.12 --> 464.479
it's the nature of power

462.24 --> 468.08
anyway i'm getting really

464.479 --> 468.08
convoluted off track right now

468.72 --> 472.319
uh

470.479 --> 473.68
let's see

472.319 --> 477.03900000000004
hey agm

473.68 --> 479.599
right dusty ryder

477.039 --> 483.599
it is monday

479.599 --> 487.919
the 23rd of august 2021

483.599 --> 487.919
i named the show white noise privilege

489.599 --> 494.479
i i don't even remember for sure like

491.919 --> 497.68
who started bringing up white noise as a

494.479 --> 499.75899999999996
as a phrase first

497.68 --> 501.28000000000003
but it has come up like in the recent

499.759 --> 504.0
week i don't remember who came with it

501.28 --> 506.87899999999996
first i'm i'm certainly certain that i'm

504.0 --> 509.28
not the one that named it that at first

506.879 --> 512.08
and i don't remember who i got it from

509.28 --> 514.4789999999999
it's a really good

512.08 --> 514.479
phrase

515.599 --> 521.12
so i turned it into my typical

519.36 --> 524.08
joke thingy

521.12 --> 527.44
made it into white noise privilege

524.08 --> 530.88
oh look at the fractal implications i

527.44 --> 530.8800000000001
love that [ __ ] you know it

531.04 --> 537.36
all right who has white noise privilege

534.399 --> 537.36
can anybody guess

539.279 --> 543.519
oh hey

540.56 --> 546.64
nathan oakley

543.519 --> 551.92
good to have you here john bernards

546.64 --> 551.92
no you know who made this you can see it

558.32 --> 564.32
now if if it's going to be a thumbnail

560.56 --> 566.0799999999999
nail of mine you'd recognize by the

564.32 --> 568.8000000000001
style

566.08 --> 572.279
because i am like well comparatively to

568.8 --> 572.279
most a minimalist

578.56 --> 582.2399999999999
and the one that made this

580.399 --> 585.92
definitely isn't

582.24 --> 585.92
so you should know who made it

591.839 --> 594.8000000000001
hey tom parker

596.16 --> 599.4399999999999
right but anyway yeah and white noise

597.839 --> 601.12
you know a lot of people have white

599.44 --> 603.7600000000001
noise

601.12 --> 605.12
and it is kind of like a privilege

603.76 --> 607.76
effectively

605.12 --> 610.079
socially you know why

607.76 --> 611.519
because everybody else needs to deal

610.079 --> 613.76
with them

611.519 --> 616.24
they don't suffer really under it they

613.76 --> 617.12
might feel a little triggered or stupid

616.24 --> 619.76
but

617.12 --> 620.9590000000001
they're blissfully ignorant

619.76 --> 623.279
literally

620.959 --> 625.279
mechanically esoterically

623.279 --> 627.04
it's the people that are in the know

625.279 --> 629.519
that have to actually

627.04 --> 632.56
carry the their burden their spiritual

629.519 --> 634.5600000000001
burden thus white noise privilege

632.56 --> 636.959
see how a joke

634.56 --> 639.4399999999999
isn't actually a joke

636.959 --> 643.68
but extremely serious

639.44 --> 646.9200000000001
fractal nature people this is what i do

643.68 --> 646.92
this is

654.56 --> 659.3599999999999
and the funny thing is there's a lot of

656.48 --> 662.16
people and a lot of groups

659.36 --> 663.36
with their own fundies and their own

662.16 --> 665.36
triggers

663.36 --> 666.16
and we all know them

665.36 --> 670.0790000000001
like

666.16 --> 673.1999999999999
they we have had to form around them

670.079 --> 674.8
in our conception of social society

673.2 --> 677.12
around us

674.8 --> 679.04
right because of white noise privilege

677.12 --> 681.36
because they are out of their minds and

679.04 --> 685.04
we have to deal with them they're not

681.36 --> 688.04
gonna stop it they're not gonna go away

685.04 --> 688.04
see

689.519 --> 696.5600000000001
white noise is human rights for

693.44 --> 698.0790000000001
for globetarts that's

696.56 --> 699.279
yeah

698.079 --> 700.7199999999999
there you go

699.279 --> 702.32
that's one

700.72 --> 706.0
right they're not the only ones dude

702.32 --> 706.0
there's so many white noise

706.24 --> 711.36
there's a lot of it

708.0 --> 711.36
but in a way you know

714.0 --> 718.639
no

715.839 --> 721.36
yeah i can't say no it's just that

718.639 --> 723.44
it's extremely difficult to go through

721.36 --> 724.32
life

723.44 --> 726.5600000000001
like

724.32 --> 729.279
at least seemingly getting anywhere

726.56 --> 730.88
without basically attaining some white

729.279 --> 733.279
noise here and there

730.88 --> 735.12
for practical purposes usually and then

733.279 --> 736.8
eventually it gets

735.12 --> 738.88
weird on you

736.8 --> 741.1999999999999
you have to decide am i gonna keep this

738.88 --> 743.6
re for real or am i actually gonna try

741.2 --> 747.279
to ascend above the situation that

743.6 --> 748.24
originally made me do that

747.279 --> 750.24
right

748.24 --> 754.5600000000001
but most people just can't even have

750.24 --> 756.5600000000001
that type of oversight with themselves

754.56 --> 759.3599999999999
so the white noise

756.56 --> 762.0
like permanently erases it and like they

759.36 --> 765.36
can't they can just never hear it again

762.0 --> 767.279
it's it's really bizarre

765.36 --> 771.6800000000001
it's like a

767.279 --> 773.6
psychological mechanism but it is like

771.68 --> 775.3599999999999
disturbed

773.6 --> 778.0790000000001
because originally

775.36 --> 781.04
it is you yourself training it out of

778.079 --> 783.1999999999999
you training to avoid but then because

781.04 --> 785.279
of the habit it railroads in there and

783.2 --> 789.36
then eventually

785.279 --> 789.36
you lose control over that

791.44 --> 794.72
right

792.48 --> 797.36
if you make a mistake you keep making

794.72 --> 799.44
the mistake

797.36 --> 801.12
you don't try to overcome the mistake

799.44 --> 804.32
then

801.12 --> 806.5600000000001
the mistake becomes you

804.32 --> 808.8000000000001
and then you become the mistake

806.56 --> 810.88
and then everybody has to deal with that

808.8 --> 813.76
white noise privilege

810.88 --> 816.079
see how it all comes together i've been

813.76 --> 818.8
talking about

816.079 --> 821.199
through my own little word use my own

818.8 --> 823.4399999999999
description about that

821.199 --> 825.3599999999999
for like two years

823.44 --> 827.44
you make a mistake you repeat the

825.36 --> 829.519
mistake you don't

827.44 --> 830.32
learn the lessons you don't overcome it

829.519 --> 832.88
then

830.32 --> 834.32
the mistake becomes you

832.88 --> 836.56
real wrote it

834.32 --> 838.8000000000001
and then you become the mistake in the

836.56 --> 842.4799999999999
face of society

838.8 --> 844.7199999999999
right you become insane

842.48 --> 845.6800000000001
that's what they call that when you're

844.72 --> 847.9200000000001
like

845.68 --> 848.88
locked into something it doesn't make

847.92 --> 851.12
sense

848.88 --> 851.12
right

851.36 --> 855.76
but yeah it's complicated because if

853.519 --> 858.5600000000001
like the majority it has a white noise

855.76 --> 861.12
situation and an individual

858.56 --> 862.6389999999999
does not have that specific white noise

861.12 --> 865.12
situation

862.639 --> 867.839
then he might be perceived as the one

865.12 --> 869.68
being insane for incoherently rambling

867.839 --> 871.7600000000001
and people just can't understand it

869.68 --> 873.76
because of their white noise and then

871.76 --> 877.36
they will project

873.76 --> 879.199
insane onto the individual

877.36 --> 882.16
and that's how a lot of conspiracy

879.199 --> 885.279
theorists and ended up

882.16 --> 888.8
in like padded rooms

885.279 --> 888.8
for the last 200 years

889.839 --> 895.44
right it's complicated white noise it's

892.639 --> 898.48
very complicated really because it is

895.44 --> 901.12
like a checkerboard of information

898.48 --> 904.88
there's just blank spots there

901.12 --> 906.48
and others might be on those blank spots

904.88 --> 907.4399999999999
and they might have their own blank

906.48 --> 910.24
spots

907.44 --> 914.8800000000001
that is actually your terrain where you

910.24 --> 916.88
can look and then it can be just really

914.88 --> 918.72
rough in the communication and you will

916.88 --> 920.16
just learn to hate each other because

918.72 --> 921.76
they

920.16 --> 924.079
are

921.76 --> 927.199
in the no-go zone for you

924.079 --> 929.279
psychologically right and that's also

927.199 --> 930.8
the setting

929.279 --> 935.199
for

930.8 --> 935.199
for flat earth versus anti-flat earth

937.44 --> 942.9590000000001
right

939.6 --> 942.9590000000001
hey slow mo moon buggy

948.56 --> 952.8389999999999
all right so yeah i'm very inspired

954.41 --> 959.759
[Music]

957.279 --> 963.199
it's great just how everything comes

959.759 --> 965.279
together like things that were just like

963.199 --> 966.0
the the whole thing the routine about

965.279 --> 968.399
the

966.0 --> 970.399
what i just explained

968.399 --> 972.8
about the mistake not overcoming the

970.399 --> 974.88
mistake etc

972.8 --> 978.079
that was just like a

974.88 --> 980.399
like a raw seed to me it's a raw seed

978.079 --> 982.959
that i feel was handed down to me

980.399 --> 985.519
by god almost like a prophecy and i did

982.959 --> 988.4799999999999
not know how

985.519 --> 991.279
deep-rooted it would become but i felt

988.48 --> 993.36
it and i trusted it and that's why i put

991.279 --> 994.959
it down with such conviction because i

993.36 --> 998.32
knew i was right i just didn't

994.959 --> 1000.3199999999999
understand how much yet

998.32 --> 1003.36
but i'm starting to get that more and

1000.32 --> 1004.1600000000001
more and it's almost like wow i actually

1003.36 --> 1007.92
just

1004.16 --> 1011.04
built the foundation of this idea

1007.92 --> 1014.0
and i didn't even realize

1011.04 --> 1016.959
like how big it was gonna become and

1014.0 --> 1019.12
important and then it makes me proud but

1016.959 --> 1022.16
then again yeah consciously of what did

1019.12 --> 1024.559
i really do i just got an idea i felt

1022.16 --> 1026.959
it's purity and it was able to

1024.559 --> 1031.199
kind of re-communicate that

1026.959 --> 1031.199
without letting my ego ruin it

1031.36 --> 1036.1599999999999
is that really something i need to be

1032.959 --> 1039.559
proud of did i make it

1036.16 --> 1039.559
i don't know

1042.16 --> 1048.0790000000002
i don't remember having copied even the

1045.039 --> 1050.0
formula of how i say it i i don't know

1048.079 --> 1053.2
anything else out there from which i

1050.0 --> 1055.6
have copied it

1053.2 --> 1057.919
so i feel it must have just

1055.6 --> 1060.32
came to me

1057.919 --> 1060.3200000000002
anyway

1064.4 --> 1070.72
so what are white noise privileges

1068.48 --> 1073.84
no it's just one privilege it's the

1070.72 --> 1073.84
white noise privilege

1073.919 --> 1082.16
white noise privilege means that

1077.36 --> 1082.1599999999999
everybody else has got to deal with you

1082.64 --> 1088.0800000000002
while you remain blissfully ignorant and

1085.44 --> 1091.1200000000001
feel in the right for your

1088.08 --> 1093.039
well bad behavior juvenile or whatever

1091.12 --> 1096.7199999999998
it's going to be

1093.039 --> 1096.72
that's white noise privilege

1101.44 --> 1106.4
right it's not a list of things it's

1104.08 --> 1107.6
just a natural mechanism and that's the

1106.4 --> 1108.64
privilege

1107.6 --> 1111.52
like

1108.64 --> 1112.64
your baby now everybody has to be your

1111.52 --> 1115.12
daddy

1112.64 --> 1118.1200000000001
or mommy

1115.12 --> 1118.12
right

1125.44 --> 1128.24
and the people that are in there often

1127.36 --> 1130.799
like

1128.24 --> 1132.88
they avoid even trying to be conscious

1130.799 --> 1134.96
of of what they're doing and that they

1132.88 --> 1137.5200000000002
have white noise

1134.96 --> 1140.24
they just try to work with the remaining

1137.52 --> 1141.039
consciousness

1140.24 --> 1144.0
that

1141.039 --> 1146.72
yeah or the remaining information

1144.0 --> 1150.919
we've that is allowed to them

1146.72 --> 1150.919
it just try to work with that

1151.6 --> 1156.0
well at the same time in social

1153.76 --> 1158.32
interactions and engagements with others

1156.0 --> 1160.48
that do bring up subjects that are in

1158.32 --> 1162.96
your white noise region

1160.48 --> 1165.52
you retain white noise privilege by

1162.96 --> 1168.08
acting like a piece of [ __ ] when people

1165.52 --> 1170.559
bring up those subjects try to distort

1168.08 --> 1173.6
it try to move away from the white noise

1170.559 --> 1176.08
subject that is white noise to you

1173.6 --> 1179.84
or just

1176.08 --> 1179.84
ignore it for a very long time

1183.52 --> 1186.8799999999999
it's white noise privilege

1187.76 --> 1191.559
it's what people do

1198.72 --> 1201.72
ah

1210.64 --> 1216.88
right so

1213.12 --> 1218.6399999999999
let me just like slightly discontort

1216.88 --> 1221.2800000000002
your understanding a little of what's

1218.64 --> 1223.6000000000001
out there in the world and just

1221.28 --> 1226.3999999999999
you know how like the

1223.6 --> 1229.6789999999999
mainstream globalist blah blah whatever

1226.4 --> 1231.919
narrative communist narrative says like

1229.679 --> 1233.76
white people are bad

1231.919 --> 1236.24
well

1233.76 --> 1242.28
maybe that's just a malformed statement

1236.24 --> 1242.28
maybe it's white noise people are bad

1249.36 --> 1253.9599999999998
let that sink in for a second

1284.32 --> 1287.32
so

1291.76 --> 1294.08
all right

1300.88 --> 1305.919
see how much just one little word can

1304.24 --> 1309.36
matter noise

1305.919 --> 1309.3600000000001
and it's so funny because

1311.28 --> 1318.559
of the nature of it like

1313.6 --> 1321.52
introducing noise like a word in between

1318.559 --> 1323.6789999999999
like an endlessly repeated chain of

1321.52 --> 1326.1589999999999
applications of words

1323.679 --> 1328.72
for mind control just put that one word

1326.159 --> 1331.44
in there just that one little noise

1328.72 --> 1336.159
and the whole

1331.44 --> 1336.159
deeper landscape of esoterics changes

1338.24 --> 1345.1200000000001
it's like a magical review like a page

1340.72 --> 1345.1200000000001
in between a page suddenly is revealed

1345.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
feel it

1368.72 --> 1373.6000000000001
i also noticed by the way that quantum

1370.96 --> 1378.52
of conscious went

1373.6 --> 1378.52
did another d review again

1400.799 --> 1405.28
so any comments or that or is everybody

1402.88 --> 1406.24
still trying to wake up and it just made

1405.28 --> 1408.3999999999999
you

1406.24 --> 1410.08
lock back into your dream again or

1408.4 --> 1412.4
something

1410.08 --> 1415.96
i tend to do that sometimes i do that to

1412.4 --> 1415.96
myself sometimes

1420.96 --> 1426.08
ah but today i did actually get up

1424.08 --> 1430.6
at my alarm clock

1426.08 --> 1430.6
i think at the right time so

1457.44 --> 1463.559
no noise most silence

1460.559 --> 1463.559
what

1475.679 --> 1480.96
guys guys guys can i get some feedback

1478.559 --> 1483.12
for crying out loud i i really am

1480.96 --> 1485.039
feeling like i'm just throwing pearls

1483.12 --> 1489.039
for swines again

1485.039 --> 1489.039
this just starting to piss me off guys

1495.679 --> 1501.52
i literally just conjured forth like

1498.24 --> 1504.32
this giant

1501.52 --> 1505.44
fractal natured pearl and it's just

1504.32 --> 1509.039
being

1505.44 --> 1513.8400000000001
there's no response that pisses me off

1509.039 --> 1515.52
the the good guys right in chat you

1513.84 --> 1518.9599999999998
pissing me off

1515.52 --> 1518.96
with your stony silence

1524.88 --> 1529.24
can i get some response please

1532.799 --> 1536.96
yeah i know dusty writer

1538.96 --> 1544.24
i'm just trying to help you understand

1540.799 --> 1546.799
it's more than just the gammas

1544.24 --> 1548.32
gammas are driven by it

1546.799 --> 1550.6399999999999
they have their own

1548.32 --> 1551.5
developed program

1550.64 --> 1553.76
on how to

1551.5 --> 1557.039
[Music]

1553.76 --> 1559.2
live with white noise on every level

1557.039 --> 1562.4
but that's

1559.2 --> 1564.96
just how they do it

1562.4 --> 1567.52
almost everybody has some white noise

1564.96 --> 1567.52
here and there

1568.159 --> 1572.3200000000002
like sense of responsibility and [ __ ]

1570.88 --> 1574.7990000000002
even makes it do

1572.32 --> 1577.12
to you make that do it to yourself etc

1574.799 --> 1580.36
it's just it basically sells it starts

1577.12 --> 1580.36
with self-censorship

1589.6 --> 1592.559
but

1590.799 --> 1594.8799999999999
yeah

1592.559 --> 1596.96
i thought it was pretty uncanny the idea

1594.88 --> 1596.96
of

1597.44 --> 1603.1200000000001
just like how they've used

1600.88 --> 1606.24
like how sjw

1603.12 --> 1608.9599999999998
communism views like what privilege

1606.24 --> 1612.24
to basically just confuse the [ __ ] out

1608.96 --> 1616.559
of people program weak-minded

1612.24 --> 1616.559
people to become really annoying

1617.84 --> 1620.72
and nag a whole bunch of people out

1619.919 --> 1622.64
there

1620.72 --> 1624.64
even attack them

1622.64 --> 1628.0800000000002
right

1624.64 --> 1632.0
and then to kind of like instead of just

1628.08 --> 1633.4399999999998
letting that be that pure nasty shitty

1632.0 --> 1635.36
realize like

1633.44 --> 1637.44
what is going on there

1635.36 --> 1640.559
it's almost like

1637.44 --> 1642.0800000000002
the entire thing is a straw man argument

1640.559 --> 1644.32
but it might be

1642.08 --> 1645.84
so strong

1644.32 --> 1648.0
because it is

1645.84 --> 1650.48
actually based on something that is

1648.0 --> 1652.96
pretty relevant and real

1650.48 --> 1655.039
and it's like twisted so like all the

1652.96 --> 1656.64
power of the real of it that isn't

1655.039 --> 1659.279
revealed

1656.64 --> 1661.3600000000001
is in there in the spell

1659.279 --> 1664.399
in its spell

1661.36 --> 1666.6399999999999
like twisted up

1664.399 --> 1666.6399999999999
like

1667.44 --> 1671.279
white noise because white noise is

1669.76 --> 1673.919
psychological

1671.279 --> 1675.919
and it does cause problems it causes

1673.919 --> 1677.44
rifts between people

1675.919 --> 1678.159
literally c

1677.44 --> 1681.159
c

1678.159 --> 1681.159
esoterics

1681.6 --> 1686.32
really serious here

1683.76 --> 1688.559
i want some response i don't want this

1686.32 --> 1689.9189999999999
freaking stony silence in chat i can't

1688.559 --> 1692.32
believe

1689.919 --> 1694.7990000000002
that it's not just suddenly popping and

1692.32 --> 1694.799
popping

1695.44 --> 1699.0800000000002
i don't get it

1716.799 --> 1723.559
there's 16 people watching now

1720.559 --> 1723.559
supposedly

1728.799 --> 1732.399
agm you got nothing to say about that

1730.72 --> 1735.72
john bernard you got nothing to say

1732.399 --> 1735.7199999999998
about it

1744.64 --> 1750.0800000000002
maybe aries the titan

1747.36 --> 1751.52
who thinks he's all there maybe he at

1750.08 --> 1753.4399999999998
least

1751.52 --> 1755.279
has some

1753.44 --> 1757.3600000000001
clarity

1755.279 --> 1759.52
even though like maybe through his own

1757.36 --> 1763.279
white maybe he can feedback something

1759.52 --> 1765.2
about what i said that is actually

1763.279 --> 1767.36
some kind of proof that he freaking

1765.2 --> 1771.279
understands for the the heavy

1767.36 --> 1772.1589999999999
implications of this discovery

1771.279 --> 1775.6
right

1772.159 --> 1777.279
the joke of white noise privilege may be

1775.6 --> 1781.6789999999999
a critical

1777.279 --> 1784.0
spell key component to unravel a very

1781.679 --> 1788.0800000000002
serious spell

1784.0 --> 1789.36
in the world right now this is literally

1788.08 --> 1791.76
magic

1789.36 --> 1793.039
underneath your nose that i'm presenting

1791.76 --> 1795.84
right now

1793.039 --> 1795.84
do you understand

1813.52 --> 1819.2
or are you white noised out

1815.93 --> 1822.559
[Laughter]

1819.2 --> 1824.88
do you got wise noise privilege

1822.559 --> 1826.96
right the white noise privilege not to

1824.88 --> 1829.679
listen not to

1826.96 --> 1832.08
let it crush you

1829.679 --> 1834.96
the information do you have white noise

1832.08 --> 1837.84
privilege not to speak out

1834.96 --> 1837.8400000000001
huh

1848.08 --> 1855.039
yeah aries i know i was just pulling you

1851.279 --> 1855.039
in like a wild hall

1858.159 --> 1863.279
because i hope maybe i'd get some

1859.84 --> 1865.76
response from somebody like you at least

1863.279 --> 1870.519
instead of this stony silence that's

1865.76 --> 1870.519
like really starting to piss me off

1887.2 --> 1890.2
uh

1898.0 --> 1902.559
yeah maybe i should make an addendum to

1900.64 --> 1905.6000000000001
the title oh

1902.559 --> 1907.44
adam did already do it though

1905.6 --> 1909.36
because i think that white noise

1907.44 --> 1912.64
privilege

1909.36 --> 1915.12
absolutely is like is the like the

1912.64 --> 1915.1200000000001
brother

1915.36 --> 1918.9599999999998
of pearls before swines

1919.12 --> 1924.0
and isn't that funny how pearls are

1921.44 --> 1924.0
white too

1926.72 --> 1930.32
or at least most of them

1931.2 --> 1939.6000000000001
i guess i'll have to find the comedy

1935.76 --> 1942.08
in the frustration here

1939.6 --> 1944.9599999999998
whenever man you can't force somebody to

1942.08 --> 1944.96
awaken you know

1946.96 --> 1952.96
maybe it just needs a lot of time

1949.919 --> 1955.279
and then i'll have to be patient again

1952.96 --> 1958.8400000000001
goody my greatest

1955.279 --> 1958.84
uh talent

1978.559 --> 1982.799
okay return to normal

1981.2 --> 1986.88
what do you mean you've never heard of

1982.799 --> 1986.8799999999999
that saying pearls before swines

1987.2 --> 1991.48
seriously that that is like

1992.88 --> 1999.7990000000002
that's a saying since the color yeah

1995.36 --> 1999.799
since the renaissance era

2004.159 --> 2009.44
or maybe even before nah i don't know i

2006.88 --> 2012.3990000000001
don't know where it it probably has some

2009.44 --> 2014.3200000000002
historical origin but it's

2012.399 --> 2017.5189999999998
no never seriously okay well what it

2014.32 --> 2017.519
basically says is

2017.679 --> 2021.679
it's a

2018.96 --> 2023.6000000000001
communication scenario

2021.679 --> 2026.3990000000001
where you have a

2023.6 --> 2029.36
well a farmer

2026.399 --> 2030.399
and you have his hogs that he takes care

2029.36 --> 2033.6
of

2030.399 --> 2035.4399999999998
and yeah hogs eat anything

2033.6 --> 2037.36
but yeah

2035.44 --> 2041.2
it's best to just give them food but

2037.36 --> 2043.36
what if you were just like buried in

2041.2 --> 2047.279
riches and like

2043.36 --> 2049.5989999999997
yeah the rich is basically

2047.279 --> 2052.32
have all squashed and destroyed your

2049.599 --> 2054.56
crop so you only have cash

2052.32 --> 2056.7200000000003
right well throwing

2054.56 --> 2058.399
like drank you have to feed the swines

2056.72 --> 2061.52
and they can eat anything so throwing

2058.399 --> 2064.24
like pearls to them

2061.52 --> 2067.04
right it's such a waste

2064.24 --> 2071.1189999999997
it is a metaphor for information of like

2067.04 --> 2073.04
handing out you you're in a group

2071.119 --> 2075.679
and your hand you're suddenly inspired

2073.04 --> 2077.919
to give like super high tier information

2075.679 --> 2080.8
and they're all just initiates and

2077.919 --> 2083.1189999999997
they're not like have any wild hidden

2080.8 --> 2086.079
talents so they were literally kind of

2083.119 --> 2087.2000000000003
embarrassed stare at you and be like uh

2086.079 --> 2089.28
wow

2087.2 --> 2090.48
i don't understand that but it sounds

2089.28 --> 2094.32
amazing

2090.48 --> 2094.32
now that's pearls before swines

2098.56 --> 2103.48
now [ __ ] before the shovels another

2100.48 --> 2103.48
saying

2117.359 --> 2121.44
what are you talking about dusty ryder

2122.64 --> 2127.44
you give them too much credit

2126.56 --> 2131.16
who

2127.44 --> 2131.16
who are you addressing

2133.52 --> 2137.68
bible fur oh really it's from the bible

2139.359 --> 2145.52
how sloppy of me to not remember that

2143.2 --> 2148.7999999999997
right so there you go it's even older

2145.52 --> 2148.8
than the renaissance then

2152.56 --> 2156.44
thank you for that jim smith

2169.599 --> 2174.079
i was just kind of assuming renaissance

2171.76 --> 2176.96
era because like yeah where do pearls

2174.079 --> 2179.04
come from from well from tropical island

2176.96 --> 2180.32
regions and such

2179.04 --> 2182.32
when

2180.32 --> 2185.599
did europe really get access to that

2182.32 --> 2186.96
well after the exploration phase

2185.599 --> 2189.2000000000003
supposedly

2186.96 --> 2191.04
the colonization era

2189.2 --> 2192.64
that's when suddenly all these tropical

2191.04 --> 2195.44
goods

2192.64 --> 2197.359
came into the noble noble houses and

2195.44 --> 2199.44
[ __ ] and then before that

2197.359 --> 2200.64
they would have to go through like

2199.44 --> 2203.52
endless

2200.64 --> 2203.52
trade routes

2204.8 --> 2210.0
so maybe yeah maybe pearls were like in

2207.92 --> 2212.32
europe way before then but they would

2210.0 --> 2214.96
have been just like so expensive there

2212.32 --> 2216.4
would there wouldn't be abundances of

2214.96 --> 2220.7200000000003
them

2216.4 --> 2220.7200000000003
they would have been all very expensive

2223.119 --> 2226.52
i don't know

2232.16 --> 2235.92
what

2233.28 --> 2241.0
have you heard of lord omar

2235.92 --> 2241.0
cayenne revenues no

2278.16 --> 2281.16
uh

2305.599 --> 2308.96
all right what the hell i've been saying

2307.92 --> 2312.839
that

2308.96 --> 2312.839
of course like pearls

2312.96 --> 2317.599
or like even a important part of like

2317.76 --> 2321.76
catholic church and everything so of

2320.0 --> 2323.92
course there were pearls in like

2321.76 --> 2327.8390000000004
medieval times that what the hell am i

2323.92 --> 2327.839
saying it's ridiculous

2330.48 --> 2336.96
i think i'm a little distracted

2332.88 --> 2336.96
yeah no [ __ ] chat is quiet today

2339.119 --> 2343.119
and not really

2341.04 --> 2345.44
feeding back

2343.119 --> 2349.6400000000003
the implications of what i put down

2345.44 --> 2349.64
today at all

2373.2 --> 2377.7999999999997
okay there is the titan sure

2408.0 --> 2411.839
are you sure about that aries the titan

2413.76 --> 2417.7200000000003
yeah i guess you're right the modern

2415.52 --> 2420.64
conspiracy right so they

2417.72 --> 2422.8799999999997
popularized it

2420.64 --> 2425.839
right that doesn't mean it wasn't there

2422.88 --> 2425.839
though

2428.319 --> 2432.4
right i think

2429.52 --> 2434.4
the whole development like

2432.4 --> 2436.8
i don't think people really understand

2434.4 --> 2438.8
like what the hell is actually going on

2436.8 --> 2441.44
here like that

2438.8 --> 2442.7200000000003
the illuminati and the hidden occultism

2441.44 --> 2445.04
and all that [ __ ]

2442.72 --> 2447.2799999999997
they have their ideas and of course

2445.04 --> 2449.7599999999998
you read through the materials but

2447.28 --> 2453.44
i think they were always hidden they

2449.76 --> 2454.96
were always there was always a strategy

2453.44 --> 2459.599
always

2454.96 --> 2459.599
and they're now just finding out that

2460.079 --> 2466.4
they need to preoccupy the flock

2463.599 --> 2469.119
so they basically conjure a straw man of

2466.4 --> 2471.839
themselves

2469.119 --> 2476.0
into the minds of people

2471.839 --> 2476.0
for their entertainment

2478.64 --> 2485.839
and that's why they chose strategically

2482.16 --> 2488.48
over the ages to suddenly come out

2485.839 --> 2490.4
right who's gonna start conspiracy

2488.48 --> 2492.16
theories about the illuminati the

2490.4 --> 2494.96
illuminati

2492.16 --> 2497.52
they decide upon that

2494.96 --> 2498.4
if it wasn't the illuminati

2497.52 --> 2501.2
then

2498.4 --> 2503.6800000000003
those people would be taken down before

2501.2 --> 2506.7999999999997
they would ever touch

2503.68 --> 2509.7999999999997
any communication lines

2506.8 --> 2509.8
ah

2513.04 --> 2519.2
but they need people to be preoccupied

2516.96 --> 2520.2400000000002
what is better to be preoccupied with

2519.2 --> 2524.48
than

2520.24 --> 2526.24
and fantastical hidden ancient

2524.48 --> 2528.4
conspiring

2526.24 --> 2530.8799999999997
brilliant enemy that is in league with

2528.4 --> 2530.88
the devil

2531.44 --> 2535.44
what grips the imagination more than

2534.24 --> 2539.9199999999996
this

2535.44 --> 2543.44
to people on like all kinds of levels

2539.92 --> 2546.319
appeals to like a warrior in them or

2543.44 --> 2549.52
to the squirter then there's all kinds

2546.319 --> 2552.079
of things that it that it can apply to

2549.52 --> 2554.16
that you can have a virtual relationship

2552.079 --> 2556.96
with

2554.16 --> 2559.52
the illuminati against them or for them

2556.96 --> 2560.8
in your mind with all kinds of character

2559.52 --> 2563.839
types

2560.8 --> 2566.96
so they conjured it forth themselves as

2563.839 --> 2569.839
a next step plan

2566.96 --> 2572.319
for preoccupation

2569.839 --> 2574.64
in the age of communication

2572.319 --> 2574.64
ah

2575.92 --> 2578.56
the

2576.8 --> 2581.5600000000004
white noise privilege getting to you

2578.56 --> 2581.56
again

2594.88 --> 2600.88
right also yeah practically what better

2598.079 --> 2600.88
deterrent

2603.2 --> 2606.8799999999997
deterrent for

2604.64 --> 2609.5989999999997
action against something

2606.88 --> 2612.88
then the fear of something

2609.599 --> 2616.079
well how do you spread fear

2612.88 --> 2618.7200000000003
rumors stories fantastical stories in

2616.079 --> 2622.96
league with the devil horrific torture

2618.72 --> 2622.9599999999996
things and maniacal laughs and

2623.76 --> 2626.96
and

2624.64 --> 2626.96
yeah

2627.839 --> 2632.56
just

2628.72 --> 2634.8799999999997
have something seem like it or remotely

2632.56 --> 2637.839
hint at it and people will fill in the

2634.88 --> 2637.839
rest in their minds

2644.64 --> 2649.44
right in a way they apply like fractal

2647.76 --> 2651.3590000000004
thinking too

2649.44 --> 2652.88
they just don't deal with the

2651.359 --> 2655.52
consciousness

2652.88 --> 2657.92
they deal with

2655.52 --> 2659.839
the subconscious mechanisms the earthly

2657.92 --> 2660.96
mechanisms fear

2659.839 --> 2663.2
lust

2660.96 --> 2664.64
they know the fractal implications of

2663.2 --> 2666.72
those

2664.64 --> 2670.48
not of god

2666.72 --> 2672.0
the full creation but of those things

2670.48 --> 2674.48
that's

2672.0 --> 2677.119
how they are white noise they don't see

2674.48 --> 2679.44
these other things anymore

2677.119 --> 2682.96
they only care for control that's how

2679.44 --> 2682.96
they have white noise privilege

2688.0 --> 2691.839
i i don't know what you're talking about

2697.52 --> 2702.52
protocols of the eldest design i don't

2699.52 --> 2702.52
know

2710.079 --> 2713.2000000000003
you were

2711.119 --> 2714.88
talking about radical globe leaving

2713.2 --> 2717.5989999999997
fundies

2714.88 --> 2718.48
back in 30

2717.599 --> 2720.7200000000003
what

2718.48 --> 2720.72
oh

2722.24 --> 2726.68
yeah you forgot to come out there

2748.079 --> 2753.04
i don't know exactly

2749.92 --> 2753.04
remind me what it is

2754.72 --> 2758.7599999999998
it might be a straw man

2763.76 --> 2769.0400000000004
usually if it is something that gammas

2766.24 --> 2771.52
like to bring forth and then be oh you

2769.04 --> 2773.599
have this outrageous doom

2771.52 --> 2776.16
have to squirt again

2773.599 --> 2779.04
then usually it's a straw man without

2776.16 --> 2782.0
them actually realizing it

2779.04 --> 2785.319
it's like a fear porn spell i'm not sure

2782.0 --> 2785.319
in this case

2795.52 --> 2801.2
a straw man in the sense that

2797.599 --> 2804.6400000000003
aries irwin just applied the illuminati

2801.2 --> 2804.64
modern conspiracy what

2810.56 --> 2814.56
like did i just accidentally trigger a

2813.359 --> 2817.52
whole

2814.56 --> 2818.7999999999997
wave of white noise consciousness in you

2817.52 --> 2820.64
people and that's why you're so

2818.8 --> 2822.6400000000003
preoccupied and that's why i don't feel

2820.64 --> 2826.16
like i'm connected here i don't feel

2822.64 --> 2826.16
like i'm connecting right now

2827.839 --> 2835.64
i'm having some serious issues trying to

2830.079 --> 2835.6400000000003
understand what you are talking about

2847.119 --> 2851.44
hey gordzilla 37

2855.2 --> 2858.2
what

2860.96 --> 2866.2400000000002
i think it explains how the grapplers

2863.04 --> 2866.24
will control the realm

2867.839 --> 2870.16
sure

2871.68 --> 2877.52
but don't they need

2874.0 --> 2877.52
everybody to know it

2878.319 --> 2882.8
it's like just tell them how things are

2880.48 --> 2886.16
going to be and let them squirt

2882.8 --> 2890.559
that's the whole point

2886.16 --> 2892.0
don't leak that no they have to

2890.559 --> 2894.2400000000002
show you

2892.0 --> 2897.119
and then leave it to you

2894.24 --> 2898.9599999999996
to not be able to handle it and white

2897.119 --> 2902.079
noise it

2898.96 --> 2904.0
but they showed it to you subconsciously

2902.079 --> 2905.6800000000003
it's in you now

2904.0 --> 2909.28
you have been marked

2905.68 --> 2909.2799999999997
and now your response

2909.44 --> 2914.48
of ignoring it and forgetting about it

2912.88 --> 2917.28
well it gives them

2914.48 --> 2917.28
some energy

2918.48 --> 2923.04
or you get all obsessed over it and then

2920.72 --> 2926.9199999999996
squirt realizing there's really nothing

2923.04 --> 2926.92
you can do about it

2934.88 --> 2939.96
it's just like yeah it's just a design

2936.96 --> 2939.96
plan

2952.16 --> 2955.16
so

2960.24 --> 2963.2799999999997
ah gordzilla

2964.96 --> 2967.96
what

2975.119 --> 2979.7200000000003
yeah that i don't know about that either

3000.72 --> 3003.2799999999997
all right look well on the other hand

3002.319 --> 3005.44
maybe

3003.28 --> 3008.559
you know maybe aries the titan is right

3005.44 --> 3010.839
maybe it was written like that

3008.559 --> 3013.76
but you see

3010.839 --> 3016.0789999999997
grabblers really like that

3013.76 --> 3017.119
because then

3016.079 --> 3019.52
they can

3017.119 --> 3020.48
use that

3019.52 --> 3024.16
right

3020.48 --> 3025.359
real grabblers assimilate

3024.16 --> 3027.2
the

3025.359 --> 3031.52
enemy

3027.2 --> 3033.68
their opponents project onto them

3031.52 --> 3035.04
you understand

3033.68 --> 3039.04
and that way

3035.04 --> 3041.599
they basically try to literally become

3039.04 --> 3045.2
their enemies worst nightmare do you

3041.599 --> 3045.2000000000003
understand how this works

3050.88 --> 3053.88
right

3055.04 --> 3059.2
that's why they tell you

3057.76 --> 3062.7200000000003
so you

3059.2 --> 3065.2799999999997
can white noise or squirt all day long

3062.72 --> 3066.319
over it

3065.28 --> 3068.7200000000003
and then

3066.319 --> 3070.96
they look they test

3068.72 --> 3073.1189999999997
they check the parameters they check the

3070.96 --> 3074.319
statistics and then they can size of

3073.119 --> 3075.119
okay

3074.319 --> 3077.04
well

3075.119 --> 3078.96
this group has this as their worst

3077.04 --> 3080.16
nightmare that group has that

3078.96 --> 3084.559
response

3080.16 --> 3084.5589999999997
what can we social engineer with this

3085.44 --> 3088.0
that's it

3093.68 --> 3098.8799999999997
the world is just a giant rat lab to

3096.72 --> 3098.8799999999997
them

3103.2 --> 3106.96
right it's from every perspective no

3105.28 --> 3109.3590000000004
matter how you're gonna approach this

3106.96 --> 3112.2400000000002
through magic

3109.359 --> 3115.52
like through spirit energy extra

3112.24 --> 3118.0789999999997
dimensional [ __ ] through

3115.52 --> 3120.079
social engineering through laboratory

3118.079 --> 3122.1600000000003
comparisons

3120.079 --> 3123.6800000000003
like necromancer

3122.16 --> 3126.64
it's all

3123.68 --> 3128.48
the same structural pattern

3126.64 --> 3131.7599999999998
it's all the same thing it's just

3128.48 --> 3131.76
another veneer

3135.68 --> 3140.319
control

3137.119 --> 3140.319
all about control

3141.359 --> 3145.119
depletion to weaken

3147.28 --> 3151.0
and stare around

3173.44 --> 3176.559
peoples no

3176.8 --> 3182.88
no grabblers is not peoples

3180.079 --> 3185.44
rabblers are individuals that live in a

3182.88 --> 3187.92
reversed world and hide

3185.44 --> 3190.319
under the cloak of other

3187.92 --> 3190.319
groups

3192.0 --> 3196.88
and they're in every group almost

3194.4 --> 3196.88
everywhere

3196.96 --> 3202.0
like whole categories of peoples are

3199.839 --> 3204.0789999999997
effectively grabbers grabblers are

3202.0 --> 3206.319
effectively pharisees it's just that

3204.079 --> 3208.319
what makes a real grabbler or grabbler

3206.319 --> 3209.92
is that they're usually extremely

3208.319 --> 3213.2
efficient

3209.92 --> 3215.839
to attain control they're usually also

3213.2 --> 3218.0789999999997
talented in to some degree

3215.839 --> 3220.0
right that's the real that's what makes

3218.079 --> 3222.48
the difference between a

3220.0 --> 3224.88
grappler and just a regular pharisee

3222.48 --> 3224.88
dredge

3228.24 --> 3232.5589999999997
but those

3229.599 --> 3235.3590000000004
there's talented corrupted

3232.559 --> 3238.4
individuals like that in every

3235.359 --> 3240.72
glass and every group

3238.4 --> 3244.28
they can't help themselves they gotta do

3240.72 --> 3244.2799999999997
it they gotta squirt

3253.2 --> 3258.7999999999997
or the here you go again yeah no

3256.72 --> 3260.319
no

3258.8 --> 3264.7200000000003
god

3260.319 --> 3267.119
i'm not talking about bloodline lineages

3264.72 --> 3270.0789999999997
gorzilla crying out loud i'm talking

3267.119 --> 3270.079
about the spirit

3272.24 --> 3275.9199999999996
people

3273.2 --> 3275.9199999999996
all people

3277.599 --> 3281.52
by their deeds you shall know them

3282.88 --> 3289.1600000000003
i wasn't talking about racial lineages

3286.0 --> 3289.16
or whatever

3335.44 --> 3339.28
all right but it is pretty interesting

3337.76 --> 3340.7200000000003
by the way now now that you're

3339.28 --> 3343.3590000000004
mentioning this

3340.72 --> 3346.0
if you're suggesting that

3343.359 --> 3348.5589999999997
like historical controllers erase

3346.0 --> 3350.319
themselves from history like after

3348.559 --> 3353.8390000000004
centuries

3350.319 --> 3353.839
that might be fascinating

3354.16 --> 3357.2
because

3355.2 --> 3359.9199999999996
that would also explain why the

3357.2 --> 3362.5589999999997
grabblers we know in this age

3359.92 --> 3364.88
don't actually act

3362.559 --> 3367.92
that much they're just spending most

3364.88 --> 3369.2000000000003
time trying to mind control and convince

3367.92 --> 3371.76
everybody

3369.2 --> 3374.319
try to blabber their way

3371.76 --> 3377.28
into making other people do it because

3374.319 --> 3378.4
then once they succeed

3377.28 --> 3381.8390000000004
they could

3378.4 --> 3384.7200000000003
just basically be erased

3381.839 --> 3386.88
out of the picture later on in the

3384.72 --> 3388.72
historical record and it would still

3386.88 --> 3390.799
seem to work

3388.72 --> 3393.1189999999997
right and then the ones that would have

3390.799 --> 3395.599
mind controlled everybody into that [ __ ]

3393.119 --> 3398.2400000000002
would not be part of the stories leaving

3395.599 --> 3400.7200000000003
them completely out of the scope

3398.24 --> 3402.16
just blaming everybody that eventually

3400.72 --> 3404.799
acted on them

3402.16 --> 3406.319
without giving a hint to people reading

3404.799 --> 3408.48
into the history

3406.319 --> 3412.4
that there were grabblers actually

3408.48 --> 3414.079
manipulating everybody into that [ __ ]

3412.4 --> 3415.92
they'll just leave it to a couple of

3414.079 --> 3418.88
fall guys

3415.92 --> 3420.4
right this is a great way to re-engineer

3418.88 --> 3421.52
history

3420.4 --> 3424.64
and just

3421.52 --> 3428.319
leave certain systematic destructions of

3424.64 --> 3430.64
empires out of it like the arms that

3428.319 --> 3432.4
actually borrow themselves into the

3430.64 --> 3434.8799999999997
government and [ __ ]

3432.4 --> 3437.119
they can then afterward be erased out of

3434.88 --> 3439.119
it and it would still seem like it is

3437.119 --> 3441.52
legitimate history

3439.119 --> 3444.52
yeah how about that for another cup of

3441.52 --> 3444.52
gravy

3448.72 --> 3451.04
um

3454.079 --> 3458.559
because once an actor

3456.96 --> 3461.04
in a thing

3458.559 --> 3462.96
actually physically does things that

3461.04 --> 3464.319
dramatically have an effect on

3462.96 --> 3465.2
everything

3464.319 --> 3467.359
then

3465.2 --> 3469.2799999999997
you can't erase them it's much more

3467.359 --> 3470.72
complicated to basically start blaming

3469.28 --> 3473.2000000000003
that on other people because that

3470.72 --> 3476.5589999999997
becomes suspicious and unnatural if they

3473.2 --> 3478.8799999999997
never physically acted in the world to

3476.559 --> 3481.2000000000003
cause a dramatic effect other than just

3478.88 --> 3482.2400000000002
blabbering convincing other people to do

3481.2 --> 3484.5589999999997
it

3482.24 --> 3488.64
they can just be

3484.559 --> 3491.92
later like 100 years 200 years later

3488.64 --> 3494.72
be removed out of it and nobody would

3491.92 --> 3494.7200000000003
notice that

3497.68 --> 3505.04
because they didn't physically act

3502.4 --> 3507.44
uh radically altering the shift of

3505.04 --> 3507.44
things

3508.079 --> 3511.48
what do you think

3519.44 --> 3523.599
hey pg chris shank finally somebody

3521.76 --> 3524.4
that's

3523.599 --> 3529.0
you're

3524.4 --> 3529.0
woke had a late night oh goody

3530.079 --> 3534.48
all right i still got an hour to go so

3537.04 --> 3543.4
at least finally chad is rolling it's

3539.44 --> 3543.4
about damn time

3552.319 --> 3557.319
yeah thanks return to normal i

3553.839 --> 3557.319
appreciate that

3560.48 --> 3565.92
maybe some of these swines

3563.76 --> 3568.4
digging into the pearls might realize

3565.92 --> 3571.28
that they're better than that actually

3568.4 --> 3573.839
get up on their hind legs and just pick

3571.28 --> 3576.8390000000004
the scrolls up and then turn into humans

3573.839 --> 3576.839
again

3600.559 --> 3605.7200000000003
hey dank

3602.24 --> 3605.72
good to see you

3628.559 --> 3631.559
hmm

3644.48 --> 3648.72
you know what is also kind of confusing

3646.559 --> 3652.799
about white noise privilege

3648.72 --> 3654.3999999999996
and white noise the experience in itself

3652.799 --> 3656.4
this is something that i've noticed but

3654.4 --> 3659.76
i have this lucky

3656.4 --> 3660.96
arduin alvin spark to be able to bypass

3659.76 --> 3663.8390000000004
it

3660.96 --> 3665.04
most people have experienced some white

3663.839 --> 3668.5589999999997
noise

3665.04 --> 3671.599
like the preliminaries of it

3668.559 --> 3673.3590000000004
the thing is though that once

3671.599 --> 3675.6800000000003
you're like

3673.359 --> 3677.44
you can finally get over it and the

3675.68 --> 3679.7599999999998
white noise is cancelled out and

3677.44 --> 3682.079
everything fluxes in and you're like

3679.76 --> 3683.6800000000003
oh my god that's it

3682.079 --> 3685.44
i

3683.68 --> 3686.8799999999997
i couldn't handle it but i knew there

3685.44 --> 3688.799
was something there but now i can

3686.88 --> 3691.599
finally understand

3688.799 --> 3693.839
well once that transformation happens it

3691.599 --> 3696.0
can happen some white noise does get

3693.839 --> 3697.44
cancelled out again eventually the

3696.0 --> 3699.52
problem is that

3697.44 --> 3703.119
once that happens

3699.52 --> 3705.28
people that have undergone that

3703.119 --> 3707.6800000000003
it's like they don't remember what it

3705.28 --> 3709.6800000000003
was like

3707.68 --> 3712.5589999999997
to have that white noise

3709.68 --> 3714.5589999999997
so i bet all of you have are probably

3712.559 --> 3715.76
just trying to remember like well hey

3714.559 --> 3717.92
did i

3715.76 --> 3721.5200000000004
what was i white noisy about what was

3717.92 --> 3723.52
that like and but then they have trouble

3721.52 --> 3725.839
zoning in

3723.52 --> 3727.68
on what that that experience was really

3725.839 --> 3731.68
like because it's like a completely

3727.68 --> 3731.68
different staircase level

3733.2 --> 3736.24
so it's actually

3734.799 --> 3738.72
even almost

3736.24 --> 3741.4399999999996
painful to try to do that well

3738.72 --> 3746.3999999999996
i've i'm i happened to be extremely good

3741.44 --> 3746.4
at it i needed to to take that

3746.88 --> 3750.799
that extra step

3748.72 --> 3752.8799999999997
that extra ability to be able to

3750.799 --> 3755.119
basically remember everything what it

3752.88 --> 3758.079
was like to not understand it and to

3755.119 --> 3758.079
white noise it out

3759.68 --> 3765.5989999999997
i needed that for my study i guess

3762.88 --> 3768.079
i understand it now

3765.599 --> 3769.6800000000003
but most people have trouble actually

3768.079 --> 3772.319
remembering

3769.68 --> 3774.3999999999996
not that they had white noise and that

3772.319 --> 3777.839
and even the subject

3774.4 --> 3777.839
but what it was like

3778.0 --> 3781.44
you don't really remem most people don't

3780.079 --> 3784.079
remember

3781.44 --> 3785.76
the actual sensation of what it was like

3784.079 --> 3786.96
at the time

3785.76 --> 3789.2000000000003
once you

3786.96 --> 3791.44
overcome it

3789.2 --> 3793.7599999999998
right people that are in white noise and

3791.44 --> 3796.799
don't understand it often

3793.76 --> 3798.2400000000002
can relay a whole bunch of sensories of

3796.799 --> 3800.0
what it is like they just don't

3798.24 --> 3803.9199999999996
understand it but they will be able to

3800.0 --> 3805.92
report on it i used to do that

3803.92 --> 3808.0
when i was younger

3805.92 --> 3810.48
i would just report out like i don't

3808.0 --> 3813.28
understand what's going on but i feel

3810.48 --> 3815.28
this that this that this is how i think

3813.28 --> 3816.96
about it

3815.28 --> 3819.76
i would do that

3816.96 --> 3823.28
not understanding it but just trying to

3819.76 --> 3825.44
report out in in the trust

3823.28 --> 3828.2400000000002
that i would eventually overcome it and

3825.44 --> 3832.319
that i would help people with my data

3828.24 --> 3832.319
i'm trying to explain what it is like

3833.839 --> 3837.359
yeah

3835.119 --> 3839.839
psychological studies people it's very

3837.359 --> 3839.839
serious

3841.119 --> 3845.359
it was very serious when i was young

3843.119 --> 3847.2000000000003
because i knew i had to do that or i

3845.359 --> 3850.5589999999997
would

3847.2 --> 3852.96
become even more isolated than

3850.559 --> 3856.3190000000004
to society then i'm already now and that

3852.96 --> 3856.319
would not be good

3856.88 --> 3862.52
i needed to become my own psychologist

3859.119 --> 3862.52
in many ways

3866.96 --> 3872.16
so yeah i don't know if you can relate

3868.88 --> 3872.1600000000003
to anything i just said

3873.92 --> 3877.44
do you know what it was like when you

3875.839 --> 3880.64
had white noise

3877.44 --> 3884.16
or is it very tough for you to remember

3880.64 --> 3886.48
the feeling of it not the the subject

3884.16 --> 3888.799
right we all for example know yeah we

3886.48 --> 3891.039
once believed that the globe

3888.799 --> 3891.92
and then you can intellectually reason

3891.039 --> 3894.079
out yeah

3891.92 --> 3896.7200000000003
there was white noise but can you

3894.079 --> 3898.2400000000002
remember the feeling of it

3896.72 --> 3899.5989999999997
that's hard

3898.24 --> 3901.7599999999998
isn't it

3899.599 --> 3903.44
can you get some feedback can i get some

3901.76 --> 3906.8390000000004
feedback please

3903.44 --> 3906.839
are you listening

3908.16 --> 3913.48
i'm asking a question to the chat right

3910.48 --> 3913.48
now

3932.4 --> 3935.4
well

3940.4 --> 3948.2400000000002
i sketched it all out for you like two

3943.2 --> 3948.24
three times now can i get some feedback

3949.2 --> 3954.48
do you have trouble remembering the

3951.52 --> 3956.559
exact sensation of what it was like to

3954.48 --> 3961.359
have white noise of something you've

3956.559 --> 3961.3590000000004
overcome or not can i get some feedback

3961.76 --> 3969.44
i'm not just monologuing to air people

3965.76 --> 3973.3190000000004
i'm trying to interact with you in chat

3969.44 --> 3973.319
can i get some feedback

3988.48 --> 3993.839
christ why do i have to ram it out of

3991.119 --> 3993.839
you every time

3995.07 --> 3998.179
[Music]

4006.799 --> 4011.119
thank you

4008.24 --> 4012.0789999999997
pj krishan i appreciate that yes it is

4011.119 --> 4014.319
isn't it

4012.079 --> 4017.52
well that means that you're

4014.319 --> 4020.64
already pretty talented at grabbing back

4017.52 --> 4022.16
because most people can't even sense it

4020.64 --> 4023.92
in a fading way

4022.16 --> 4026.16
it's like it's blocked out it's like

4023.92 --> 4028.4
it's around the corner

4026.16 --> 4030.319
that's how most people actually perceive

4028.4 --> 4033.2000000000003
that how do i know

4030.319 --> 4035.839
because i'm a wizard

4033.2 --> 4038.24
that's why i don't know why you know

4035.839 --> 4038.24
this is

4039.119 --> 4044.799
it's i just ugh i do remember why now

4042.4 --> 4047.039
it's because i used to have like that

4044.799 --> 4048.799
level obstacle and i would be so

4047.039 --> 4051.039
frustrated i couldn't look around the

4048.799 --> 4053.44
corner so frustrated i couldn't attain

4051.039 --> 4054.7200000000003
that psychological control that i would

4053.44 --> 4057.68
like

4054.72 --> 4061.359
scream over it so frustrated

4057.68 --> 4063.359
but i it took a lot of time eventually i

4061.359 --> 4065.839
was able to kind of look around the

4063.359 --> 4065.839
corner

4066.96 --> 4071.44
and now i can't just look anywhere i

4069.52 --> 4074.079
don't need to look around anything i

4071.44 --> 4077.839
could just see everything everywhere

4074.079 --> 4077.8390000000004
comparatively metaphorically

4085.039 --> 4088.039
right

4096.319 --> 4099.4400000000005
yes isn't it dank

4100.319 --> 4105.359
it does feel humiliating it feels like

4102.48 --> 4107.44
no you're not old enough

4105.359 --> 4110.2390000000005
right there's something like that that's

4107.44 --> 4112.5599999999995
like really annoying it is and that also

4110.239 --> 4114.718999999999
is the contributing to the white noise

4112.56 --> 4117.04
effect because you don't want that

4114.719 --> 4119.6
right you

4117.04 --> 4122.239
you'd rather just forget about it

4119.6 --> 4122.2390000000005
white noise

4122.4 --> 4126.96
well white noise is really when you

4124.88 --> 4129.839
have to deal with it but still want to

4126.96 --> 4131.92
forget about it and then it just becomes

4129.839 --> 4135.12
but at first you just try to bolt away

4131.92 --> 4135.12
you just want to step away

4141.44 --> 4146.4
define white noise privilege in one

4143.52 --> 4149.040000000001
sentence

4146.4 --> 4150.96
i i did that already i'll try it again

4149.04 --> 4153.759
it's very tough to put it in one

4150.96 --> 4153.759
sentence though

4154.48 --> 4156.799
uh

4157.44 --> 4161.599999999999
white noise privilege

4159.839 --> 4162.799
is the

4161.6 --> 4166.88
well

4162.799 --> 4167.679
the privilege of people that can't deal

4166.88 --> 4171.759
with

4167.679 --> 4173.279
information aspects of reality

4171.759 --> 4176.64
and

4173.279 --> 4180.719
other people that can will have to deal

4176.64 --> 4183.12
with their inability to deal with it

4180.719 --> 4185.44
that's white noise privilege because

4183.12 --> 4188.159
white noise is everywhere

4185.44 --> 4190.5599999999995
a lot among a lot of people

4188.159 --> 4191.92
and everybody around them has to deal

4190.56 --> 4194.2390000000005
with it like

4191.92 --> 4196.2390000000005
we kind of expect especially that

4194.239 --> 4198.239
mothers are very good at dealing with

4196.239 --> 4201.199
that right

4198.239 --> 4203.12
helping their kid to deal with it

4201.199 --> 4205.599999999999
overcome it

4203.12 --> 4207.76
but they have to deal with their

4205.6 --> 4209.84
childish behavior though right well

4207.76 --> 4212.400000000001
that's it

4209.84 --> 4214.8
that's the white noise privilege

4212.4 --> 4216.719
people that have it well you're still

4214.8 --> 4219.92
gonna have to deal with them and you're

4216.719 --> 4224.4
gonna have to deal with their childish

4219.92 --> 4227.04
and terrible sometimes demonic behavior

4224.4 --> 4228.48
but they're still integrated in society

4227.04 --> 4231.6
and everything

4228.48 --> 4233.12
so you can't punish them for them you

4231.6 --> 4234.64
right

4233.12 --> 4236.719
so you have to deal with them that's

4234.64 --> 4239.4400000000005
their white noise privilege i i hope

4236.719 --> 4239.44
that explains

4240.0 --> 4244.88
like why do rappers know no

4242.96 --> 4247.12
i'll bet they'll have some white knives

4244.88 --> 4247.12
too

4250.64 --> 4254.64
this is

4252.48 --> 4257.599999999999
look at what we got

4254.64 --> 4261.76
looky what we got here

4257.6 --> 4265.4400000000005
isn't that just cute cps

4261.76 --> 4265.4400000000005
now don't delete that

4270.0 --> 4276.239
what are you doing

4273.36 --> 4279.04
i didn't give you a wrench to delete

4276.239 --> 4279.04
such things

4281.52 --> 4285.040000000001
see see what happens

4285.12 --> 4289.92
don't play their game he's trying to

4287.199 --> 4289.919999999999
grabble you

4290.159 --> 4295.36
you gotta have thick skin it's a war

4292.4 --> 4298.08
these people are everywhere everywhere

4295.36 --> 4301.12
if you're going to like compulsively try

4298.08 --> 4304.32
to remove them then you are trying to

4301.12 --> 4306.64
create a white noise of their existence

4304.32 --> 4309.28
don't do it

4306.64 --> 4312.64
right only when they cross borders that

4309.28 --> 4312.639999999999
they really shouldn't

4313.28 --> 4319.759999999999
like perversion

4316.48 --> 4322.239
or like extreme aggression

4319.76 --> 4324.719
not a little aggressive i am a little

4322.239 --> 4327.04
aggressive extreme aggression and

4324.719 --> 4329.52
perversions like a serious perversions

4327.04 --> 4332.4
that's

4329.52 --> 4335.280000000001
you don't delete them for being blatant

4332.4 --> 4337.759999999999
obviously projecting liars

4335.28 --> 4340.88
you don't delete them for that

4337.76 --> 4344.159000000001
you have to show it you have to trust

4340.88 --> 4346.719
that everybody can see it for what it is

4344.159 --> 4349.12
you have to let it burn you have to let

4346.719 --> 4350.8
it burn you have to let it burn they

4349.12 --> 4352.88
will lie

4350.8 --> 4356.320000000001
until the end of their lives they will

4352.88 --> 4359.1990000000005
never stop ever you have to let it burn

4356.32 --> 4361.84
you have to let it burn don't remove

4359.199 --> 4361.839999999999
that [ __ ]

4362.239 --> 4367.5199999999995
every time you delete a message

4365.199 --> 4368.4
where they are projecting the [ __ ] out

4367.52 --> 4369.679
of it

4368.4 --> 4370.639999999999
they

4369.679 --> 4372.88
win

4370.64 --> 4373.84
do you understand they

4372.88 --> 4378.159000000001
win

4373.84 --> 4378.159000000001
never be tempted to do that

4378.32 --> 4382.239
it's my phone

4380.56 --> 4384.2390000000005
right

4382.239 --> 4387.12
okay i'll give you the benefit of the

4384.239 --> 4388.32
doubt but i i still use the scenario to

4387.12 --> 4390.8
basically

4388.32 --> 4393.5199999999995
bring out an important message

4390.8 --> 4396.2390000000005
i don't know whether that's

4393.52 --> 4400.719
a sneaky excuse or

4396.239 --> 4400.718999999999
but it's fine i i will trust you on this

4406.08 --> 4410.36
that's right let it burn out

4418.239 --> 4423.12
i wouldn't delete a message like um you

4420.88 --> 4427.76
make a good case

4423.12 --> 4429.36
ah it's one of those weird subconscious

4427.76 --> 4431.52
it's like

4429.36 --> 4433.92
the freaking devil always finds a way to

4431.52 --> 4435.280000000001
do this sort of [ __ ] right like even if

4433.92 --> 4437.76
you're trained to do it your

4435.28 --> 4440.48
subconscious or whatever weird it's like

4437.76 --> 4442.56
right at that moment you drop your phone

4440.48 --> 4443.759999999999
or something and then oh it deleted the

4442.56 --> 4444.719
message

4443.76 --> 4447.1990000000005
right

4444.719 --> 4449.04
that [ __ ] happens it's like reverse

4447.199 --> 4450.159
synchronicity

4449.04 --> 4452.96
it's

4450.159 --> 4455.839999999999
troll synchronicity they always make it

4452.96 --> 4455.84
happen

4458.239 --> 4461.239
ah

4469.6 --> 4473.52
better than everybody sitting around and

4471.28 --> 4476.08
not responding no it's fine

4473.52 --> 4479.4400000000005
no everybody is responding i just had to

4476.08 --> 4481.679
kind of slap it out of them again

4479.44 --> 4485.12
because they all just got i don't know

4481.679 --> 4485.12
hypnotized or something

4485.76 --> 4491.4400000000005
or just flashbacks of all kinds of [ __ ]

4489.6 --> 4494.0
and it just took a little longer than i

4491.44 --> 4498.48
had patience for i just like wanted like

4494.0 --> 4499.52
uh well the way i would respond to super

4498.48 --> 4502.48
heavy

4499.52 --> 4505.6
fractal implicative statements and that

4502.48 --> 4509.199
is instantly instantly that's how i

4505.6 --> 4512.400000000001
respond to things instantly

4509.199 --> 4514.719
show me the exception show me the

4512.4 --> 4517.12
exception

4514.719 --> 4519.6
does it matter how complicated [ __ ] is

4517.12 --> 4521.679
that you roll out in front of me i

4519.6 --> 4522.8
respond instantly

4521.679 --> 4525.52
yeah

4522.8 --> 4528.320000000001
that's my privilege

4525.52 --> 4530.56
that's my ability and sometimes i get

4528.32 --> 4532.799999999999
impatient that other people can't do

4530.56 --> 4532.8
that

4536.88 --> 4542.08
because it does slow down [ __ ] i'm just

4539.44 --> 4544.5599999999995
waiting a lot of the time

4542.08 --> 4546.64
on other people and hey i've even

4544.56 --> 4549.1990000000005
experienced that yeah well plenty of

4546.64 --> 4551.52
times in my life my brother used to had

4549.199 --> 4552.799999999999
to have the same problem with me dealing

4551.52 --> 4554.56
with me

4552.8 --> 4557.56
because i had a lot of wide noise as a

4554.56 --> 4557.56
kid

4566.96 --> 4571.6
all right but you know it's true it

4568.56 --> 4573.6
doesn't matter how heavy

4571.6 --> 4576.88
and how fractal rich

4573.6 --> 4580.159000000001
like how how many millions of words and

4576.88 --> 4584.32
implications are laid into a a fragment

4580.159 --> 4588.5599999999995
of information i'll respond instantly

4584.32 --> 4591.199
and my instant response will be attuned

4588.56 --> 4594.400000000001
it will be fractal too

4591.199 --> 4597.04
i'm a freaking wizard man

4594.4 --> 4598.5599999999995
i can do that [ __ ] i'm not the only one

4597.04 --> 4601.84
though

4598.56 --> 4603.76
and i should try to like put less weight

4601.84 --> 4606.2390000000005
on it for my ego because it's not

4603.76 --> 4606.2390000000005
healthy

4607.36 --> 4610.48
but i can do that

4610.88 --> 4613.52
instantly

4628.0 --> 4631.0
right

4642.0 --> 4647.6
white noise privilege is my concept

4645.12 --> 4648.32
i think it is

4647.6 --> 4651.76
but

4648.32 --> 4654.639999999999
the metaphor of white noise as a

4651.76 --> 4657.1990000000005
psychological phenomena is not my

4654.64 --> 4660.56
concept i got it from somebody else i

4657.199 --> 4663.599999999999
don't exactly remember who

4660.56 --> 4668.159000000001
i did like i've been hearing it

4663.6 --> 4670.0
being used in in different

4668.159 --> 4672.879999999999
streams

4670.0 --> 4675.12
like simultaneous it's like the new word

4672.88 --> 4677.12
it's leaked out people are like

4675.12 --> 4679.28
understand the metaphor

4677.12 --> 4681.44
of basically blocking things out it's

4679.28 --> 4683.199
really prevalent now i don't know where

4681.44 --> 4686.48
it started out

4683.199 --> 4687.36
but white noise privilege

4686.48 --> 4690.799999999999
that

4687.36 --> 4693.04
i did invent that's my

4690.8 --> 4694.96
joke and it's not a joke that's the

4693.04 --> 4695.92
funny [ __ ] thing about it it's not a

4694.96 --> 4697.679
joke

4695.92 --> 4698.719
ah

4697.679 --> 4700.96
ah

4698.719 --> 4702.719
arwen

4700.96 --> 4708.0
the joke that isn't a joke but it's

4702.719 --> 4711.36
still a joke yeah that's me i did that

4708.0 --> 4711.36
oh my ego again

4717.36 --> 4723.32
right i'm gonna go

4719.199 --> 4723.32
two minutes i'll be right back

4741.44 --> 4744.44
so

4815.199 --> 4819.5599999999995
wizard that what

4837.92 --> 4845.8
no

4840.239 --> 4845.799999999999
no aries the titan i think that's static

4850.4 --> 4855.12
oh wait let me double check the origin

4852.56 --> 4855.120000000001
of the word

4855.23 --> 4862.159
[Applause]

4858.159 --> 4864.08
yeah i knew it yeah yeah you're wrong

4862.159 --> 4865.199
no white noise is different it's

4864.08 --> 4868.08
actually

4865.199 --> 4868.08
negative sound

4870.56 --> 4874.84
i think

4871.6 --> 4874.84
wait what

4882.96 --> 4889.28
oh wait is it background noise

4886.32 --> 4891.12
is it background static noise or was it

4889.28 --> 4893.12
because i remember there being a

4891.12 --> 4894.4
technology where you can literally

4893.12 --> 4897.4
cancel out

4894.4 --> 4897.4
sound

4902.56 --> 4906.0
was that called something else

4907.76 --> 4910.159000000001
crap

4913.44 --> 4918.32
yeah

4914.48 --> 4918.32
that's cute get the [ __ ] out

4918.8 --> 4922.2390000000005
unbelievable [ __ ]

4924.639 --> 4931.32
noise cancellation

4927.12 --> 4931.32
right isn't that white noise

4931.36 --> 4937.839999999999
i thought that just regular background

4934.08 --> 4941.48
side sound is called static

4937.84 --> 4941.4800000000005
not white noise

4945.76 --> 4948.08
right

4948.639 --> 4950.88
no

4953.6 --> 4958.2390000000005
well anyway

4955.199 --> 4959.599999999999
it technically doesn't even matter

4958.239 --> 4962.239
because when i

4959.6 --> 4965.04
did the sound

4962.239 --> 4966.48
that kind of is like static sound or

4965.04 --> 4967.84
white noise

4966.48 --> 4970.718999999999
and that is

4967.84 --> 4973.679
so whether you are going to like

4970.719 --> 4976.159
emphasize like the nothing or the

4973.679 --> 4978.08
useless background sound

4976.159 --> 4980.879999999999
that is replaced in the mind of the

4978.08 --> 4983.28
person as a metaphor when they blank out

4980.88 --> 4986.96
in the face of certain information or

4983.28 --> 4987.84
whether do you emphasize

4986.96 --> 4991.36
like

4987.84 --> 4994.08
inverse noise where you literally

4991.36 --> 4996.32
yeah absorb the sound and then give the

4994.08 --> 4998.719
exact counter sorry sound which

4996.32 --> 5000.88
literally cancel this out this is

4998.719 --> 5002.96
technology that actually exists for over

5000.88 --> 5004.0
20 years at least

5002.96 --> 5005.84
like

5004.0 --> 5007.44
absolute sound cancellation you

5005.84 --> 5009.679
completely reverse it around i think

5007.44 --> 5012.0
even some cars have in their [ __ ]

5009.679 --> 5013.1990000000005
right on the inside

5012.0 --> 5015.04
and

5013.199 --> 5016.4
yeah whether you apply it to that

5015.04 --> 5018.239
technology

5016.4 --> 5020.48
because yeah they're literally not

5018.239 --> 5023.199
hearing it aren't they right so either

5020.48 --> 5025.839999999999
way it works out it works out just fine

5023.199 --> 5028.799999999999
either way i'm just little confused as

5025.84 --> 5031.28
to the exact

5028.8 --> 5034.0
definitions

5031.28 --> 5036.159
like are they kind of like interchanged

5034.0 --> 5039.92
popularly

5036.159 --> 5042.4
which is it is static white noise

5039.92 --> 5045.36
what is the official technology called

5042.4 --> 5047.36
that literally cancels out sound

5045.36 --> 5049.12
i don't remember it

5047.36 --> 5051.679
i thought it was white noise but it

5049.12 --> 5053.28
might be wrong

5051.679 --> 5056.719
either way it doesn't really matter

5053.28 --> 5060.159
because it's gonna work out anyway

5056.719 --> 5063.04
and i really like the word white noise

5060.159 --> 5065.5199999999995
because it's funny because it has white

5063.04 --> 5070.12
image and then i can basically use it

5065.52 --> 5070.120000000001
for the title of the show

5077.199 --> 5082.28
it's there

5078.96 --> 5082.28
on screen

5085.199 --> 5088.08
e and r

5089.28 --> 5094.159
yeah but that's not a full word i'll

5091.92 --> 5095.52
look it up though thank you for telling

5094.159 --> 5098.5199999999995
me

5095.52 --> 5098.52
dnr

5100.88 --> 5104.08
that's not helping

5108.0 --> 5114.0
so

5110.08 --> 5115.76
yeah i hey blue marble signs i typed in

5114.0 --> 5118.48
google enr

5115.76 --> 5119.84
it didn't give me anything

5118.48 --> 5121.919999999999
so

5119.84 --> 5123.84
can you spell it out perhaps since you

5121.92 --> 5125.76
seem to know what i'm talking about

5123.84 --> 5128.639
about this technology could could you

5125.76 --> 5128.639
spell it out

5132.96 --> 5137.639
electronic noise reduction

5137.85 --> 5140.999000000001
[Applause]

5142.56 --> 5145.719
all right

5162.88 --> 5168.400000000001
noise control

5164.88 --> 5170.400000000001
active noise cancellation

5168.4 --> 5173.599999999999
that's that's

5170.4 --> 5176.48
disappointing to me it seems like the

5173.6 --> 5178.719
technology doesn't have a definitive

5176.48 --> 5181.759999999999
terminology

5178.719 --> 5183.92
it doesn't have a

5181.76 --> 5186.56
technological word for it that is kind

5183.92 --> 5186.56
of annoying

5193.679 --> 5199.679
i don't know what that means

5196.719 --> 5199.679
return to normal

5202.4 --> 5205.679
like

5203.199 --> 5206.638999999999
don't assume i know all these freaking

5205.679 --> 5209.88
shorts

5206.639 --> 5209.88
i don't

5216.08 --> 5219.679
right

5216.96 --> 5219.679
active noise

5221.679 --> 5225.639
active noise right

5226.159 --> 5228.879999999999
a and r

5232.8 --> 5238.8
oh yeah c they have three

5235.28 --> 5240.88
so it's a and c and c a and r yeah ooh

5238.8 --> 5242.639
thanks

5240.88 --> 5244.8
right but that's the the other thing

5242.639 --> 5247.12
that i was talking about i thought it

5244.8 --> 5248.96
was called white noise too

5247.12 --> 5249.84
i guess i must have mixed it up in my

5248.96 --> 5252.56
head

5249.84 --> 5253.92
but yeah whether you apply

5252.56 --> 5256.639
lnr

5253.92 --> 5259.28
or white noise to the concept

5256.639 --> 5261.679
of the psychological description right

5259.28 --> 5263.199
of blanking things out it both kind of

5261.679 --> 5265.1990000000005
applies

5263.199 --> 5267.44
because they are cancelling it out in

5265.199 --> 5270.879999999999
there they're literally like listening

5267.44 --> 5273.759999999999
and not hearing it that requires out

5270.88 --> 5273.76
cancellation

5274.96 --> 5278.76
you see what i mean

5283.76 --> 5286.639
anti-noise

5289.6 --> 5294.159000000001
right

5290.56 --> 5296.719
you what the hell

5294.159 --> 5300.239
a cat just came walking in

5296.719 --> 5301.6
from the outside hello kitty

5300.239 --> 5303.5199999999995
this is

5301.6 --> 5305.84
what are you doing here kitty

5303.52 --> 5305.84
hey

5306.239 --> 5309.5599999999995
look at that

5312.84 --> 5315.93
[Music]

5326.96 --> 5331.88
yes don't know where you came from

5336.96 --> 5339.36
hello

5341.679 --> 5345.96
oh he's a very young one

5360.08 --> 5365.44
i guess that's

5362.0 --> 5366.32
one of the neighbors got a new kitty

5365.44 --> 5368.879999999999
wow

5366.32 --> 5374.36
cat what the hell

5368.88 --> 5374.36
yeah thanks for dust sweeping that

5382.32 --> 5385.92
yeah he's a ginger tom all right

5388.159 --> 5394.0
i don't know

5389.84 --> 5397.88
is he male are you are you a boy

5394.0 --> 5397.88
oh yeah he's a boy

5406.48 --> 5411.12
thank you for sweeping the dust here

5408.719 --> 5411.12
kitty

5418.0 --> 5421.719
hey amanda young

5434.4 --> 5439.679
yeah pj krishan yeah white noise

5436.96 --> 5440.8
definitely associated with like tv

5439.679 --> 5442.4800000000005
static

5440.8 --> 5444.320000000001
but that's the thing i thought it was

5442.48 --> 5446.159
just called static but see the

5444.32 --> 5448.5599999999995
association so

5446.159 --> 5450.5599999999995
white noise is is already kind of

5448.56 --> 5453.6
blurred up

5450.56 --> 5455.679
as a concept in people's minds

5453.6 --> 5458.639
it's not that

5455.679 --> 5458.639
settled down

5459.52 --> 5467.2390000000005
it still has some elusive esoteric grip

5463.199 --> 5467.239
kitty not my bed

5484.48 --> 5489.08
wow he's like really exploring

5492.159 --> 5497.879999999999
autonomous sensory meridian response

5494.88 --> 5497.88
when

5507.679 --> 5511.84
hubris cancels out learning yeah

5512.719 --> 5516.96
yeah kitty i know that's like 20 years

5515.44 --> 5519.919999999999
of freaking history you're smelling

5516.96 --> 5523.679
there including a

5519.92 --> 5523.679
very special lady cat

5524.08 --> 5529.8
that tragically died

5526.239 --> 5529.799999999999
eight years ago

5536.96 --> 5541.6
oh

5539.28 --> 5543.599999999999
he's a little nervous

5541.6 --> 5546.6
but he's still in the exploration phase

5543.6 --> 5546.6
so

5556.239 --> 5560.879999999999
i wonder if like somebody just got him

5558.88 --> 5562.88
and is just releasing him that's that

5560.88 --> 5565.6
wouldn't be very wise

5562.88 --> 5566.88
if you want your cat to really

5565.6 --> 5569.04
anchor down

5566.88 --> 5571.12
in your house you have to like lock him

5569.04 --> 5573.199
in

5571.12 --> 5575.5199999999995
into like a specific room for a couple

5573.199 --> 5577.12
of days sounds kind of mean right you

5575.52 --> 5579.76
want to give them the freedom well they

5577.12 --> 5582.639
have to get used to and associate it as

5579.76 --> 5585.12
their base ground

5582.639 --> 5587.36
like every cat

5585.12 --> 5589.04
they have to have like the original

5587.36 --> 5591.839999999999
place they're put in

5589.04 --> 5594.48
like one room

5591.84 --> 5597.4400000000005
still visit them don't like leave them

5594.48 --> 5599.759999999999
isolated in there that's terrible

5597.44 --> 5601.919999999999
but for this couple of days so they have

5599.76 --> 5604.08
their like psychological retreat room

5601.92 --> 5606.8
where it started to them then you leave

5604.08 --> 5608.88
them in the rest of the house

5606.8 --> 5609.92
and then eventually

5608.88 --> 5612.08
you can

5609.92 --> 5613.76
leave them to the outdoor

5612.08 --> 5615.44
because if you just let them out they're

5613.76 --> 5617.84
just gonna disappear

5615.44 --> 5617.839999999999
this is

5620.8 --> 5625.1990000000005
what's my latest roommate situation uh

5623.6 --> 5626.719
well she's

5625.199 --> 5630.08
gonna move in

5626.719 --> 5632.719
september so

5630.08 --> 5632.719
over a week

5638.719 --> 5643.44
and the situation seems

5641.92 --> 5644.639
nominal

5643.44 --> 5647.5199999999995
we'll see

5644.639 --> 5647.52
what's going to happen

5650.08 --> 5656.4
i met both her parents now already it

5653.44 --> 5656.4
was very quick

5657.28 --> 5659.84
uh

5693.679 --> 5698.88
yeah pj krishan yeah the mandy young is

5696.48 --> 5702.4
really

5698.88 --> 5702.400000000001
you gotta spell her name right

5702.48 --> 5706.119
you really do

5725.28 --> 5728.719
oh

5726.32 --> 5731.04
hey

5728.719 --> 5731.04
damn

5733.36 --> 5739.08
he's exploring the place like he's gonna

5735.44 --> 5739.08
move in or something

5742.239 --> 5745.239
huh

5765.84 --> 5772.0
right so yeah i'm kind of

5770.08 --> 5774.5599999999995
run through

5772.0 --> 5774.56
everything

5774.719 --> 5780.0
even got arwenian strict on everybody's

5777.6 --> 5785.08
ass and loud

5780.0 --> 5785.08
at least everybody does seem awake now

5786.159 --> 5791.96
i guess it was just one of those monday

5788.239 --> 5791.959999999999
mornings or something

5811.76 --> 5817.84
does anyone else get this asmr thing

5815.92 --> 5820.8
just me what do you mean

5817.84 --> 5820.8
return to normal

5824.8 --> 5829.360000000001
you bring a new concept to the table you

5826.719 --> 5831.28
need to let's see no return to normal

5829.36 --> 5833.28
you're supposed to

5831.28 --> 5836.159
instantly understand everything and

5833.28 --> 5838.719
respond immediately to the same level

5836.159 --> 5840.4
instantly instantly instantly don't you

5838.719 --> 5843.44
understand

5840.4 --> 5846.32
how frustrating it is that nobody else

5843.44 --> 5846.32
does that [ __ ]

5846.56 --> 5848.96
sorry

5849.76 --> 5853.2390000000005
it's all right

5861.28 --> 5864.28
uh

5881.04 --> 5883.84
ah what

5883.92 --> 5887.92
hair loss in the air

5885.679 --> 5887.92
ooh

5892.56 --> 5895.56
tinnitus

5898.56 --> 5902.4800000000005
what is tinnitus are you sure you don't

5900.719 --> 5905.119
mean tightness

5902.48 --> 5905.119
or what is it

5905.84 --> 5909.56
i never heard of that

5917.92 --> 5920.92
so

5924.639 --> 5929.84
well steamy traveler

5927.36 --> 5932.159
it's not necessarily disrespectful and

5929.84 --> 5934.8
annoying but it is if they don't

5932.159 --> 5936.5599999999995
interrupt that conversation and then

5934.8 --> 5938.56
when i address them they're like what

5936.56 --> 5940.0
i'm sorry i didn't know what you were

5938.56 --> 5942.2390000000005
talking about

5940.0 --> 5944.32
because of my white noise i wanted to

5942.239 --> 5946.08
have my conversation

5944.32 --> 5947.759999999999
right yeah that's literally like we're

5946.08 --> 5949.84
in a classroom and you're having a

5947.76 --> 5951.52
conversation with somebody in the net

5949.84 --> 5954.08
the

5951.52 --> 5956.080000000001
desk next to you right when the teacher

5954.08 --> 5960.0
is talking and trying to explain

5956.08 --> 5962.48
something yeah that is annoying i agree

5960.0 --> 5964.8
but as long as they yeah since

5962.48 --> 5967.119
the chat is silent

5964.8 --> 5969.1990000000005
right there's no sound

5967.119 --> 5972.08
rolling over me it's not that bad as

5969.199 --> 5973.599999999999
long as they at least pay attention

5972.08 --> 5975.44
right that's what i want first and

5973.6 --> 5979.52
foremost you can have whatever

5975.44 --> 5982.5599999999995
conversation you like but just don't

5979.52 --> 5985.1990000000005
don't put me out of the attention that

5982.56 --> 5985.1990000000005
will be great

5986.0 --> 5992.119
tinitus

5987.679 --> 5992.119
i never heard of that steamy traveler

5994.639 --> 5999.1990000000005
but it sounds really annoying

5997.679 --> 6002.4800000000005
i think like

5999.199 --> 6005.5199999999995
one of my former former roommates

6002.48 --> 6008.4
had that and the ear problem

6005.52 --> 6011.92
the very only partial hearing and she

6008.4 --> 6011.92
and she heard noise all the time

6018.32 --> 6022.88
i have i

6020.96 --> 6025.36
have some

6022.88 --> 6028.08
minor issues with just

6025.36 --> 6031.5199999999995
my ears sometimes but not my hearing

6028.08 --> 6033.36
thank god not my hearing

6031.52 --> 6035.679
very careful with my hearing always have

6033.36 --> 6037.599999999999
been just with my side

6035.679 --> 6039.52
and it's still great

6037.6 --> 6042.159000000001
like my dad

6039.52 --> 6044.400000000001
has hearing damage

6042.159 --> 6046.08
because he used to play in a band and

6044.4 --> 6048.4
then he would just get

6046.08 --> 6051.6
right next to speakers that were just

6048.4 --> 6053.759999999999
way too loud

6051.6 --> 6055.76
i've been always very careful not to do

6053.76 --> 6057.76
that

6055.76 --> 6058.639
even when i'm going out and it's like

6057.76 --> 6059.84
okay

6058.639 --> 6062.400000000001
this

6059.84 --> 6065.119000000001
is too loud then i'm just gonna go it's

6062.4 --> 6068.08
like no i'm not

6065.119 --> 6070.5599999999995
i don't want to just be here be part of

6068.08 --> 6072.32
the mood or whatever these people if

6070.56 --> 6075.280000000001
it's going to freaking damage my hairy

6072.32 --> 6077.84
and i can feel what it does right i can

6075.28 --> 6080.88
feel that i can don't know if everybody

6077.84 --> 6083.76
can i can freaking feel that i can feel

6080.88 --> 6086.159000000001
the preliminaries and i can feel like

6083.76 --> 6089.4400000000005
yeah if it's just this little bit more

6086.159 --> 6091.599999999999
or this much longer this is the level of

6089.44 --> 6092.638999999999
damage it's gonna cause over this period

6091.6 --> 6094.4800000000005
of time

6092.639 --> 6096.08
and if you keep on doing that then it

6094.48 --> 6099.36
never goes away

6096.08 --> 6099.36
right so i'm yeah

6100.0 --> 6102.719
thank god

6104.48 --> 6108.159
my ears are still very good

6108.96 --> 6112.639
but my hearing is kind of the first

6110.88 --> 6116.400000000001
thing to go

6112.639 --> 6118.639
psychologically when i have white noise

6116.4 --> 6123.04
because or when i'm thinking when i'm

6118.639 --> 6124.639
like really thinking then it's like

6123.04 --> 6127.6
just they don't hear it anymore

6124.639 --> 6129.76
literally don't it doesn't it doesn't

6127.6 --> 6132.56
enter it doesn't enter my consciousness

6129.76 --> 6135.52
anymore because my thinking is just like

6132.56 --> 6137.6
puts the whole rewiring of consciousness

6135.52 --> 6141.8
in another form and just like i

6137.6 --> 6141.8
literally just can't hear anymore

6150.88 --> 6156.400000000001
and then eventually i don't really look

6153.04 --> 6157.6
anymore either but my looks

6156.4 --> 6159.36
can still

6157.6 --> 6161.52
kind of snap me out of it visual

6159.36 --> 6163.44
distracts me more than sound because

6161.52 --> 6167.080000000001
when i'm really focused i don't really

6163.44 --> 6167.08
hear anything anymore

6181.84 --> 6187.76
unless like it is specifically required

6185.199 --> 6190.759999999999
to focus on some sound then it's

6187.76 --> 6190.76
different

6197.44 --> 6201.199
you can't listen to football commentary

6199.679 --> 6202.35
anymore because of the white noise

6201.199 --> 6206.03
privilege

6202.35 --> 6206.030000000001
[Laughter]

6209.199 --> 6213.759999999999
right the white noise privilege which

6211.52 --> 6216.320000000001
they obviously tried to avoid right

6213.76 --> 6218.4800000000005
because that is like

6216.32 --> 6220.88
mainstream narrative that's like even

6218.48 --> 6222.239
like ooh going to the stars and all the

6220.88 --> 6223.4400000000005
globe

6222.239 --> 6225.5199999999995
that's

6223.44 --> 6226.96
because of white noise privilege like

6225.52 --> 6229.679
they have to

6226.96 --> 6232.159
try to prevent people from zoning out

6229.679 --> 6233.84
and disconnecting through white noise

6232.159 --> 6237.5199999999995
privilege

6233.84 --> 6240.159000000001
by ensuring that the typical things that

6237.52 --> 6243.400000000001
cause white noise privileges

6240.159 --> 6243.4
are avoided

6247.679 --> 6251.04
right

6249.119 --> 6253.28
that's like mainstream narrative

6251.04 --> 6255.5199999999995
construction what things do you include

6253.28 --> 6257.36
which things do you absolutely leave out

6255.52 --> 6259.679
at all times

6257.36 --> 6261.759999999999
and also the the types of words you're

6259.679 --> 6263.4400000000005
going to choose for it

6261.76 --> 6266.08
because some words

6263.44 --> 6268.879999999999
bring better associations more positive

6266.08 --> 6271.28
associations than others for typical

6268.88 --> 6272.8
white noise privileged people

6271.28 --> 6275.04
see

6272.8 --> 6279.6
it all works it's a very sophisticated

6275.04 --> 6279.6
mechanism and people get it intuitively

6279.679 --> 6284.4
and there's probably just lists

6282.4 --> 6287.199
and [ __ ] for this

6284.4 --> 6290.4
elaborate studies

6287.199 --> 6290.4
psychology of words

6292.0 --> 6295.0
etc

6305.36 --> 6310.88
oh god the mask [ __ ] ah that's

6308.88 --> 6313.28
terrible

6310.88 --> 6315.679
i had forgotten about it i had forgotten

6313.28 --> 6318.4
about the masks guys

6315.679 --> 6320.639
i actually white noise privileged it out

6318.4 --> 6322.32
of my mind i didn't i don't want to know

6320.639 --> 6324.719
about that that exists it's so

6322.32 --> 6326.799999999999
embarrassing i literally forgot that

6324.719 --> 6328.2390000000005
that existed because i don't watch

6326.8 --> 6331.1990000000005
anything

6328.239 --> 6332.5599999999995
ever where people wear masks

6331.199 --> 6335.199
and i don't go

6332.56 --> 6338.0
to places where people wear masks i

6335.199 --> 6340.5599999999995
literally forgot that existed just now i

6338.0 --> 6344.48
got reminded like what the [ __ ] oh god

6340.56 --> 6347.84
yes they do that don't they ah

6344.48 --> 6347.839999999999
i white noised it out

6348.32 --> 6352.119
until i got reminded

6362.08 --> 6365.36
that's so embarrassing

6365.76 --> 6369.92
right so don't forget that there is no

6367.76 --> 6372.639
universal

6369.92 --> 6374.639
white noise right

6372.639 --> 6376.88
when there's polarization

6374.639 --> 6379.1990000000005
especially political polarization

6376.88 --> 6381.28
there's going to be white noise right

6379.199 --> 6383.678999999999
things you can't stand from the other

6381.28 --> 6386.639
side and when you're just not going to

6383.679 --> 6389.36
be willing to listen to their personal

6386.639 --> 6391.679
details about that thing because you

6389.36 --> 6394.5599999999995
know it's all [ __ ] right from that

6391.679 --> 6396.8
or you think you know it's all [ __ ]

6394.56 --> 6398.84
from that perspective that's already the

6396.8 --> 6400.719
cause of white noise so

6398.84 --> 6401.679
yeah

6400.719 --> 6403.84
us

6401.679 --> 6406.639
android vectors

6403.84 --> 6409.52
truthers flat earthers yeah we can't

6406.639 --> 6410.88
stand mask [ __ ] we can't stand v

6409.52 --> 6413.679
[ __ ]

6410.88 --> 6414.639
right we can't stand that we have white

6413.679 --> 6416.719
noise

6414.639 --> 6418.8
towards that anything that associates

6416.719 --> 6421.84
with that we don't really want to know

6418.8 --> 6422.8
about it because we know it's [ __ ]

6421.84 --> 6426.639
right

6422.8 --> 6428.88
well that is like micro white noise too

6426.639 --> 6430.719
but it's for a good reason

6428.88 --> 6433.04
because why would we want to get

6430.719 --> 6434.159
drenched in all that stupid garbage

6433.04 --> 6436.56
right

6434.159 --> 6439.28
it's completely useless we know how it

6436.56 --> 6439.280000000001
is useless

6439.44 --> 6442.799999999999
and at the same time there's another

6441.36 --> 6445.679
issue because you gotta

6442.8 --> 6448.96
be careful not to drown into the

6445.679 --> 6451.92
paranoia of the situation either

6448.96 --> 6453.52
like when people start to spread rumors

6451.92 --> 6454.8
like oh they're gonna come for you

6453.52 --> 6456.719
they're gonna

6454.8 --> 6459.92
oh they're gonna force you onto the

6456.719 --> 6462.159
ground and stick it in you or oh

6459.92 --> 6463.52
they're gonna put you in the camps right

6462.159 --> 6467.04
well

6463.52 --> 6470.320000000001
it'd be wise to maybe to some level also

6467.04 --> 6473.5199999999995
develop some white noise against that

6470.32 --> 6476.5599999999995
because if you don't

6473.52 --> 6479.76
then you're going to be very very

6476.56 --> 6479.76
distracted by that

6480.719 --> 6484.719
right so figure out like

6483.199 --> 6487.678999999999
is this real

6484.719 --> 6490.56
could that actually happen

6487.679 --> 6491.679
wouldn't that literally break

6490.56 --> 6494.2390000000005
everything

6491.679 --> 6496.719
like literally everything that's like

6494.239 --> 6498.959999999999
okay once a spell

6496.719 --> 6501.84
like verbal spell mind control once a

6498.96 --> 6504.159
spell to this worldwide skill level

6501.84 --> 6506.88
snaps like that

6504.159 --> 6509.44
it's such utter destruction

6506.88 --> 6511.92
nobody wants that the controllers don't

6509.44 --> 6513.599999999999
want that nobody wants that the rumors

6511.92 --> 6517.6
that they want

6513.6 --> 6517.6
that is absolute garbage

6520.96 --> 6524.0
they don't want that

6524.719 --> 6528.32
they just want to try to create

6526.48 --> 6530.879999999999
controlled opposition to discourage

6528.32 --> 6532.639
that's all they really want they don't

6530.88 --> 6535.4400000000005
want things to go out of control they

6532.639 --> 6535.4400000000005
don't want to

6537.199 --> 6541.919999999999
for people to actually snap in a way

6540.08 --> 6544.32
that they're going to be decisively

6541.92 --> 6546.88
doing pretty extreme things they don't

6544.32 --> 6546.88
want that

6547.119 --> 6552.159
they just want to

6549.199 --> 6554.159
make you so cowardly cowarding out that

6552.159 --> 6555.36
you're going to spiral inward and just

6554.159 --> 6558.638999999999
like

6555.36 --> 6560.48
do yourself or some random person that

6558.639 --> 6561.92
you don't even know by the time that

6560.48 --> 6563.36
you're gonna act like that you don't

6561.92 --> 6566.639
even know what you're doing anymore

6563.36 --> 6568.88
right not the actual people designing

6566.639 --> 6571.1990000000005
all this [ __ ] and actively mind

6568.88 --> 6573.599
controlling everybody to kill themselves

6571.199 --> 6575.839999999999
no those are not the ones that they want

6573.599 --> 6577.76
you to flip out over and actually do all

6575.84 --> 6580.2390000000005
that no they just want to

6577.76 --> 6582.400000000001
want you to spiral inward so you have

6580.239 --> 6584.0
absolutely no more grip over reality

6582.4 --> 6586.4
you're just gonna off yourself in some

6584.0 --> 6588.96
random person

6586.4 --> 6591.28
that's what they want they don't want

6588.96 --> 6595.599
you to go after them and that's why i've

6591.28 --> 6597.199
been so mercilessly mercilessly opposed

6595.599 --> 6599.1990000000005
to that notion

6597.199 --> 6601.5199999999995
it's like no

6599.199 --> 6601.5199999999995
no

6601.76 --> 6609.1990000000005
no they [ __ ] their pants over the idea

6605.199 --> 6612.96
that somebody's actually gonna be like

6609.199 --> 6612.96
[ __ ] all of this

6613.28 --> 6618.5599999999995
i'm really

6615.119 --> 6619.679
really gonna make them pay this time

6618.56 --> 6621.679
right

6619.679 --> 6624.679
they're [ __ ] their pants over that

6621.679 --> 6624.679
notion

6625.92 --> 6630.32
they just want to erect some controlled

6628.8 --> 6633.4400000000005
opposition

6630.32 --> 6635.44
to make you spiral inwards and then

6633.44 --> 6638.08
basically destroy yourself and some

6635.44 --> 6640.48
random person and then they can use that

6638.08 --> 6640.48
again

6641.119 --> 6645.679
to shove in everybody's face and

6643.84 --> 6648.639
right they use that

6645.679 --> 6653.4400000000005
they don't actually use real people that

6648.639 --> 6654.56
get very serious and like do real damage

6653.44 --> 6656.08
they

6654.56 --> 6658.159000000001
fear them

6656.08 --> 6660.4
they don't even want to recognize those

6658.159 --> 6662.638999999999
exists i don't even know if they're

6660.4 --> 6664.32
actually out there doing that

6662.639 --> 6667.04
because they will not let you know

6664.32 --> 6669.5199999999995
they're that [ __ ] afraid of it and

6667.04 --> 6673.04
everybody that says different

6669.52 --> 6676.040000000001
is either part of the system or just

6673.04 --> 6676.04
wrong

6682.719 --> 6684.88
no

6687.119 --> 6692.159
puppet masters

6689.119 --> 6692.159
they're gonna get it

6693.04 --> 6696.159
it's not going to be stopped it's not

6694.56 --> 6698.2390000000005
going to be discouraged it's not going

6696.159 --> 6700.239
to be avoided it's got not going to be

6698.239 --> 6703.5199999999995
bypassed

6700.239 --> 6707.08
nothing can stop this

6703.52 --> 6707.080000000001
it's going to happen

6708.159 --> 6713.28
the time is over

6710.719 --> 6716.84
their game is over

6713.28 --> 6716.84
it's gonna stop

6725.58 --> 6729.84
[Music]

6727.44 --> 6729.839999999999
anyway

6730.639 --> 6734.28
that was kind of random

6742.8 --> 6747.360000000001
don't know how i ended up in that

6744.32 --> 6749.44
conversation or rather monologue not

6747.36 --> 6752.4
really a conversation

6749.44 --> 6752.4
a black worm

6760.32 --> 6765.04
don't be sorry just

6762.0 --> 6767.52
look before you press enter yes

6765.04 --> 6770.159
indeed george sanford

6767.52 --> 6772.0
that thing should like be ingrained on

6770.159 --> 6774.5599999999995
your retina

6772.0 --> 6777.56
like everybody should just always see

6774.56 --> 6777.56
that

6778.56 --> 6785.1990000000005
look at what you're writing

6780.8 --> 6788.56
before you press enter actively think

6785.199 --> 6790.799999999999
feedback to yourself what you wrote down

6788.56 --> 6793.84
before you automatically press enter as

6790.8 --> 6793.84
soon as you stop typing

6794.159 --> 6796.4
right

6797.52 --> 6801.599
you're supposed to communicate not

6799.28 --> 6804.599
squirt out letters as quickly as

6801.599 --> 6804.599
possible

6811.119 --> 6813.36
all right

6813.599 --> 6819.96
what is that

6816.0 --> 6819.96
is that cat's still here

6837.44 --> 6842.08
oh you're you're still dissing on pj

6839.599 --> 6846.04
krishan dude don't worry about it

6842.08 --> 6846.04
like i've done that

6854.32 --> 6858.96
just spelling somebody's name wrong it's

6856.56 --> 6861.52
like if i would literally act

6858.96 --> 6863.92
if i'd be like really

6861.52 --> 6866.719
pissy about that i'd have a problem

6863.92 --> 6868.719
because like half the people constantly

6866.719 --> 6870.8
misspell my name and don't even realize

6868.719 --> 6870.8
it

6872.56 --> 6876.639
there was with this other virgin that

6875.04 --> 6877.84
just

6876.639 --> 6880.719
whatever

6877.84 --> 6882.400000000001
for some reason my name is really easy

6880.719 --> 6884.0
to misspell

6882.4 --> 6886.08
for a lot of people

6884.0 --> 6888.08
i don't even know if they do it on

6886.08 --> 6891.239
purpose or not anymore i just don't care

6888.08 --> 6891.239
i just

6895.119 --> 6900.32
but yeah if in a youtube chat you get it

6897.92 --> 6901.76
wrong then that name is just not gonna

6900.32 --> 6904.32
pop up to me

6901.76 --> 6906.88
right because if you spell it right it's

6904.32 --> 6908.48
going to be orange so i see i'm being

6906.88 --> 6911.28
addressed

6908.48 --> 6911.28
that's the difference

6912.239 --> 6919.44
don't let him get off the hook

6914.96 --> 6921.679
don't be silly pg crew shank is ace

6919.44 --> 6925.678999999999
he is a good guy

6921.679 --> 6925.679
i'm very happy he's a part of this chat

6928.32 --> 6933.5199999999995
it gets auto corrected quite a lot yeah

6930.48 --> 6937.598999999999
auto correction is [ __ ]

6933.52 --> 6939.52
it's garbage it it picks words

6937.599 --> 6941.52
you know it might be spelled right but

6939.52 --> 6943.599
they're just not the right words and

6941.52 --> 6945.679
then if you're just leaning on that and

6943.599 --> 6948.08
passing quickly you don't even realize

6945.679 --> 6950.159
it's picking out a word that is nothing

6948.08 --> 6951.92
like what you want it to say

6950.159 --> 6953.92
and then you press enter and then you

6951.92 --> 6956.08
look like an idiot

6953.92 --> 6959.04
yeah i have this

6956.08 --> 6961.199
myself sometimes it's really annoying

6959.04 --> 6964.159
when that happens and then i'm like oh

6961.199 --> 6966.159
damn it just stupid

6964.159 --> 6970.4
stupid thing and then i have to like

6966.159 --> 6972.32
retract it and paste it over again

6970.4 --> 6973.679
and correct it

6972.32 --> 6976.32
because

6973.679 --> 6981.52
i had to hurry it up i had to type

6976.32 --> 6981.5199999999995
squirt stupid habit bad habit

6986.4 --> 6989.839999999999
turn off autocorrect

6990.88 --> 6994.639
yeah i don't have autocorrect but i do

6992.8 --> 6995.76
have spell check

6994.639 --> 6997.599
right

6995.76 --> 6999.360000000001
and sometimes you can just put down the

6997.599 --> 7001.599
wrong word

6999.36 --> 7003.199
but it's spelled correctly technically

7001.599 --> 7006.08
so you don't see it

7003.199 --> 7008.0
super annoying

7006.08 --> 7011.599
but yeah this is the hazards of

7008.0 --> 7016.44
communication just read what you typed

7011.599 --> 7016.4400000000005
carefully before you say it

7016.48 --> 7020.799999999999
if you're actually trying to communicate

7018.56 --> 7022.56
something

7020.8 --> 7025.119000000001
that has details

7022.56 --> 7026.719
