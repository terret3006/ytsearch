6.26 --> 36.6
[Music]

42.38 --> 44.440000000000005
you

47.52 --> 49.550000000000004
ooh

50.04 --> 55.29
morning welcome to flatter the earlybird

52.41 --> 57.239999999999995
number 442 I'm your host

55.29 --> 58.86
Arwen before I start to show please

57.24 --> 60.84
don't forget to share it on any platform

58.86 --> 62.46
you deem fit and if you haven't already

60.84 --> 64.05
subscribed to my channel and hit the

62.46 --> 66.09
bell notification so you know when I'm

64.05 --> 67.8
going live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

66.09 --> 69.99000000000001
Amsterdam time every day

67.8 --> 71.97
please also do support me through the

69.99 --> 74.6
PayPal page or my GoFundMe and the super

71.97 --> 76.77
chat that would be much appreciate it so

74.6 --> 80.55
yeah sorry for being little bit late

76.77 --> 83.75
just timing was off a bit look at the

80.55 --> 83.75
weather it's again so

92.35 --> 98.1
no chemtrails some planes and air no

95.53 --> 98.1
chemtrails

101.77 --> 107.35
and yeah it's just beautiful bright

104.29 --> 109.869
although yeah it is cold the air is kind

107.35 --> 115.14
of cold so I went for groceries this

109.869 --> 115.14
morning pretty early for my doing and

115.2 --> 121.60000000000001
yeah when you go against the wind

118.96 --> 124.63
you totally freeze up it's so cold but

121.6 --> 127.41999999999999
then on the way back I was basically

124.63 --> 130.149
riding with the wind and then was like

127.42 --> 134.34
no cold at all it's an odd experience

130.149 --> 134.34
but yeah it's pretty beautiful

138.94 --> 144.37
yeah

141.13 --> 150.60999999999999
so don't worry I don't have a hangover

144.37 --> 154.36
from yesterday I did have a lot of fun

150.61 --> 157.27
yesterday I was on rattie's by the way

154.36 --> 162.03
and if nobody's if somebody's noticed

157.27 --> 164.65
that but yeah peachy a man Oh God

162.03 --> 167.32
you can have a normal conversation with

164.65 --> 169.0
that guy like every time he would just

167.32 --> 171.57999999999998
start up a question and then he would

169.0 --> 173.59
branch out to like four completely

171.58 --> 174.34
different things that have nothing to do

173.59 --> 176.62
with one another

174.34 --> 180.16
and so he just I just didn't really know

176.62 --> 184.99
what to say anymore it was really

180.16 --> 188.91
annoying so I just left eventually but

184.99 --> 188.91
yeah I was interesting while it lasted

200.97 --> 203.97
okay

204.92 --> 212.03
well I did kind of put PJ on the spot

207.65 --> 213.95000000000002
they're asking for any follow-up or

212.03 --> 217.34
evidence basically describing what he's

213.95 --> 220.67
been doing because yeah he tried to stay

217.34 --> 222.38
civil right he kind of did but he was

220.67 --> 225.67999999999998
just so all over the place it was almost

222.38 --> 228.23
kind of schizophrenic in a way and I was

225.68 --> 231.38
just not in the mood to entertain that

228.23 --> 233.06
and yeah pointing it out didn't really

231.38 --> 234.26
seem to help either because he was just

233.06 --> 236.87
constantly red herring

234.26 --> 239.76999999999998
everything even red herring his own

236.87 --> 239.77
points it's just

252.91 --> 259.239
all right t-bone while the horizon is a

255.28 --> 263.19
reification fallacy when you presuppose

259.239 --> 263.19
that it is the leading edge of a sphere

264.66 --> 270.31
it's very simple hey and you can already

267.67 --> 273.46000000000004
set it you know you can stop doing it

270.31 --> 277.06
now that's all really nice but that's

273.46 --> 279.66999999999996
not really helping your religion just

277.06 --> 281.92
means you step away because yeah that is

279.67 --> 287.71000000000004
what ballers have claimed boats go over

281.92 --> 290.16
to rise and remember that made bets it

287.71 --> 293.34999999999997
was suggested that it is the curvature

290.16 --> 295.42
that it is indeed a physical obstruction

293.35 --> 298.27000000000004
that it is the leading of edge of a

295.42 --> 300.49
sphere and then the curvature calculator

298.27 --> 302.95
originally came into being in order to

300.49 --> 305.77
support that now we've all figured that

302.95 --> 307.71999999999997
out that its machinations that the

305.77 --> 314.66999999999996
horizon is actually a purely visual

307.72 --> 317.8
effect an arbitrary apparent point so

314.67 --> 319.27000000000004
yeah that did undoes the original

317.8 --> 321.52000000000004
argument but that was the global

319.27 --> 326.5
argument now you can all step away from

321.52 --> 328.71
that it doesn't make what happened go

326.5 --> 328.71
away

333.669 --> 336.27
all right

346.29 --> 350.43
no I definitely don't think I will end

348.75 --> 353.9
up like PETA I just think the only one

350.43 --> 353.90000000000003
that will end up like Pete is Pete

361.35 --> 364.85
[Music]

367.83 --> 370.99
[Music]

372.639 --> 378.499
right well it doesn't matter if you

375.469 --> 380.899
concluded or whether you assumed it as

378.499 --> 384.649
soon as you're gonna ascribe some kind

380.899 --> 388.609
of geometry to the horizon then you're

384.649 --> 392.239
wrong and that's when you start to

388.609 --> 395.029
presuppose a lot of things so yeah you

392.239 --> 397.549
conclude it doesn't matter if you if you

395.029 --> 399.919
concluded or if you just point out that

397.549 --> 404.529
you presuppose it if you conclude it

399.919 --> 415.36899999999997
then you base your conclusion on a false

404.529 --> 421.689
presupposition so good luck with that it

415.369 --> 421.689
doesn't matter if it's the same lorry

425.279 --> 434.479
one does not exclude the other if you

431.639 --> 437.399
conclude it then in that conclusion

434.479 --> 439.669
there is the presupposition which is

437.399 --> 439.669
wrong

447.28 --> 453.85999999999996
[Music]

449.53 --> 456.79999999999995
well that's very simple t-bone how can

453.86 --> 458.75
the horizon on a flat earth not be a

456.8 --> 460.39
reification fallacy as well as very

458.75 --> 466.4
simple we don't claim it as a

460.39 --> 468.62
geometrical thing we just described at

466.4 --> 471.22999999999996
the optics to it because that is what it

468.62 --> 474.38
is it's an apparent effect an arbitrary

471.23 --> 478.34000000000003
point has to do with vision itself a

474.38 --> 480.05
combination of how far actual refraction

478.34 --> 482.57
will allow you to see before everything

480.05 --> 484.28000000000003
becomes a gray soup and the diffraction

482.57 --> 487.09999999999997
effect of what you're looking over

484.28 --> 491.05999999999995
combined with your the lens qualities of

487.1 --> 492.65000000000003
your eyes or your camera that is what

491.06 --> 495.29
causes the horizon the fact it's a

492.65 --> 500.2
purely optical phenomena that that just

495.29 --> 500.20000000000005
happens mostly because of diffraction

500.56 --> 505.7
and you don't have to presuppose

504.53 --> 508.78999999999996
anything for it

505.7 --> 514.5989999999999
you can simply prove all these elements

508.79 --> 514.599
and we have demonstrated them

518.93 --> 524.04
we base our structure I base my

522.0 --> 527.46
structural explanations on actual

524.04 --> 534.93
experimental data concerning optics

527.46 --> 537.4200000000001
fraction index diffraction effects I all

534.93 --> 540.5999999999999
base all these things on things that I

537.42 --> 543.7199999999999
have seen happening that I've seen

540.6 --> 545.97
demonstrations of and therefore I'd say

543.72 --> 550.34
that my approach is much more

545.97 --> 555.38
fundamentally sound than any globe model

550.34 --> 555.38
idea so

560.37 --> 563.519
[Applause]

572.58 --> 577.96
now they're not obstructed from the

576.19 --> 582.7
bottom up they're concealed and again

577.96 --> 585.13
it's because of diffraction or did you

582.7 --> 587.71
just ignore that part refraction

585.13 --> 589.06
right the actual refraction of the air

587.71 --> 594.49
itself the medium we were looking

589.06 --> 597.18
through it sets the limit as to how far

594.49 --> 599.35
we can distinguish in what we see

597.18 --> 601.0
because after certain point things

599.35 --> 602.65
become so blurred up that even if there

601.0 --> 604.77
were objects there you just certainly

602.65 --> 607.6
wouldn't see them beyond that point

604.77 --> 611.26
because it's just a gray soup length

607.6 --> 613.12
light cannot arrive from there in a

611.26 --> 616.81
coherent fashion enough for you to make

613.12 --> 618.58
anything out that's refraction and then

616.81 --> 620.3499999999999
there's diffraction that's what happens

618.58 --> 622.0
when you look over surfaces you can

620.35 --> 623.5
demonstrate this on the smaller scale as

622.0 --> 625.54
well you can do this in a warehouse or

623.5 --> 630.43
in your supermarket or if you have small

625.54 --> 632.89
camera on a big table things will

630.43 --> 635.02
obstructs not due to any geometrical

632.89 --> 639.31
obstruction because it's all confirmed

635.02 --> 642.03
flat measurable flat has to be flat

639.31 --> 642.03
these things

642.1 --> 647.89
so that optical effect that what you

645.97 --> 650.0500000000001
think is obstruction it's actually

647.89 --> 653.29
consuming and it's natural and it's due

650.05 --> 657.52
to the lens and what happens when you

653.29 --> 659.38
look over a flat surface its

657.52 --> 663.37
demonstrable we've demonstrated that

659.38 --> 666.4
that effect to be there he can't

663.37 --> 670.24
possibly attribute it to any kind of

666.4 --> 673.51
physical obstruction and now there isn't

670.24 --> 675.25
in the in the outer world at the sea for

673.51 --> 679.42
example there is some obstruction going

675.25 --> 681.49
on for example a waves can definitely

679.42 --> 683.41
obstruct or is in the background

681.49 --> 686.77
especially if they're showing going on

683.41 --> 690.01
when the big body of water is basically

686.77 --> 692.11
shoved onto the land and there because

690.01 --> 694.96
there literally is a little bulge of

692.11 --> 699.19
water it can be can be over a mile wide

694.96 --> 701.5600000000001
or more and it can be relatively high up

699.19 --> 704.62
compared to everything that Elda see in

701.56 --> 708.13
the back and that will cause a yeah a

704.62 --> 713.25
big more of an actual obstruction not

708.13 --> 717.01
just concealment so that adds on to it

713.25 --> 719.2
but you don't require that kind of

717.01 --> 720.9399999999999
obstruction in order to have any kind of

719.2 --> 724.4200000000001
horizon effect because it's still there

720.94 --> 729.4000000000001
in a perfectly flat surface in the salt

724.42 --> 732.9699999999999
flats it's there see that super low

729.4 --> 736.4499999999999
tranquil water ripple as' perfect mirror

732.97 --> 739.09
reflection well the effect happens there

736.45 --> 741.9300000000001
and that's absolutely there's no Baldy

739.09 --> 746.25
anywhere there it's as flat as could be

741.93 --> 746.25
and the rise in fact is still there

752.04 --> 757.9499999999999
but it doesn't work that way tiny mumble

754.85 --> 761.0400000000001
it doesn't matter if the effect is still

757.95 --> 764.09
there on a curved surface the effect is

761.04 --> 766.8299999999999
also there on a straight surface

764.09 --> 770.1
therefore you can't attribute it to

766.83 --> 772.2900000000001
curvature the effect in itself because

770.1 --> 774.44
it's there it's inherent aside

772.29 --> 776.8399999999999
you can't attribute it to any

774.44 --> 780.1800000000001
geometrical curvature because it's not

776.84 --> 785.25
doesn't matter if it should also be

780.18 --> 788.6099999999999
there if there was curvature that's not

785.25 --> 792.63
that wasn't the original argument for

788.61 --> 797.4300000000001
the globe it's claimed that the horizon

792.63 --> 801.24
is the thing that things go over and

797.43 --> 803.6999999999999
then go over the curvature that was the

801.24 --> 807.1800000000001
original claim don't I know you all

803.7 --> 809.7800000000001
don't like that anymore now what that is

807.18 --> 809.78
what it is

813.85 --> 826.78
oh really I do that t-bone know that

825.37 --> 829.24
sounds like you're projecting there

826.78 --> 831.79
you're piling up excuses after excuse

829.24 --> 835.21
and I explained every single detail from

831.79 --> 838.12
every necessary angle so if you don't

835.21 --> 839.98
get it at this point then you're just

838.12 --> 849.37
not listening and you're now spiraling

839.98 --> 851.29
out of control yes I did I explained it

849.37 --> 853.03
I explained the horizon on the flat

851.29 --> 854.5899999999999
earth as she tried to strawman me

853.03 --> 856.54
originally thinking that we would

854.59 --> 858.97
presuppose anything already explained

856.54 --> 860.68
why that's not the case I explained why

858.97 --> 864.28
you can't interpret it as actual

860.68 --> 866.62
curvature then I got to hear how you

864.28 --> 869.11
know horizon is also there on a curve

866.62 --> 871.54
well that's that doesn't help your

869.11 --> 875.77
argument because it was supposed to be

871.54 --> 877.0899999999999
the proof of the curve so if you're

875.77 --> 878.8299999999999
going to retract from that that means

877.09 --> 880.36
you're going to retract from that that

878.83 --> 884.2800000000001
doesn't mean that what was said and done

880.36 --> 884.28
was not said and done it was

888.33 --> 893.9000000000001
yeah the curve is presupposed still is

894.35 --> 900.45
concerning the celestial bodies alone

897.77 --> 903.96
unless you want to step away from that -

900.45 --> 907.83
I doubt that ballers will do that it's

903.96 --> 910.14
the core part it's a the envelopment of

907.83 --> 911.6700000000001
the stars around the globe or if well

910.14 --> 912.39
for that to work you need the earth to

911.67 --> 914.4
be curved

912.39 --> 915.9
so yeah in order for all that to work

914.4 --> 918.24
you're going to presuppose that curve

915.9 --> 919.53
because in actuality you can't find any

918.24 --> 921.96
proof of the curve because the earth

919.53 --> 923.55
seems perfectly flat because in low

921.96 --> 926.61
refraction conditions you can see

923.55 --> 929.01
incredibly far more as is incredibly far

926.61 --> 932.34
means no curvature nothing obstructing

929.01 --> 934.68
it so yeah you are going to presuppose

932.34 --> 936.98
that curve in every space

934.68 --> 940.26
conceptualisation in any globe

936.98 --> 942.57
conceptualisation oh yes you are because

940.26 --> 944.64
the curvature is an inherent part of the

942.57 --> 947.6400000000001
globe you cannot say there is no

944.64 --> 950.79
curvature even though you still claim to

947.64 --> 954.74
be on a globe with the size and geometry

950.79 --> 954.74
that has been set

960.1 --> 966.88
that air is know from space there's no

963.71 --> 966.88
photograph from space

986.46 --> 992.52
where's everybody gone why am i

990.9 --> 995.03
surrounded by baller said this is

992.52 --> 995.03
getting annoying

1001.089 --> 1008.879
this is just all the typical baller

1003.729 --> 1013.4300000000001
garbage you're not you're not listening

1008.879 --> 1015.779
just doubling down on your nonsense I

1013.43 --> 1018.4889999999999
[Music]

1015.779 --> 1022.409
don't need that kind of love please keep

1018.489 --> 1025.329
your religious conjecture to yourself

1022.409 --> 1034.6
stop red-herring me and stop straw

1025.329 --> 1037.209
Manning me please yeah you live in a bad

1034.6 --> 1042.039
situation don't talk to me like that

1037.209 --> 1044.74
buddy it's one thing if you start

1042.039 --> 1046.209
basically trying to break my organs put

1044.74 --> 1050.759
words in my mouth and all that nonsense

1046.209 --> 1050.759
but you don't talk to me like that okay

1060.35 --> 1067.0
[Music]

1071.26 --> 1074.26
No

1075.36 --> 1078.8999999999999
trainer Jim that's yeah there's not

1077.7 --> 1082.039
really gonna work

1078.9 --> 1082.039
[Music]

1082.84 --> 1088.98
could be done but you know there there's

1086.53 --> 1091.71
not exactly a lot of coherency

1088.98 --> 1095.13
concerning the entire Flat Earth

1091.71 --> 1098.3500000000001
everybody's stuck on their own ideas

1095.13 --> 1100.42
their own presuppositional options as it

1098.35 --> 1103.87
were and how's that all going to work

1100.42 --> 1106.99
together no that's the problem with the

1103.87 --> 1110.29
with freedom truth and the Flat Earth

1106.99 --> 1114.07
movement is that it's too divided the

1110.29 --> 1117.01
globe works because it is a it is a very

1114.07 --> 1120.99
effective hierarchy system it's very

1117.01 --> 1124.54
authoritarian works to that psychology

1120.99 --> 1126.76
that's why it's easy to just insert it

1124.54 --> 1129.7
into a school system and it'll run

1126.76 --> 1131.5
itself eventually just need a couple of

1129.7 --> 1133.72
key people to do the right tricks and

1131.5 --> 1136.78
everybody will start to believe and then

1133.72 --> 1140.77
perpetuate that belief that's not gonna

1136.78 --> 1142.96
work with the Flat Earth it's not gonna

1140.77 --> 1145.0
have the same effect and that you don't

1142.96 --> 1147.76
want it to you we don't want to be a

1145.0 --> 1153.69
replacement for the we don't need

1147.76 --> 1153.69
another religion that thank you

1157.8 --> 1164.21
but hey I think that potential

1160.17 --> 1167.43
flat-earthers could should be allowed to

1164.21 --> 1168.96
share their ideas at least on the

1167.43 --> 1172.47
internet for starters of course while we

1168.96 --> 1174.78
have but also maybe some of these things

1172.47 --> 1182.34
should be addressed in schools schools

1174.78 --> 1186.03
that are more open-minded and at least I

1182.34 --> 1190.3799999999999
think that it should not be as

1186.03 --> 1192.09
discouraged anymore like being mean to

1190.38 --> 1194.67
little children when they think that

1192.09 --> 1198.05
Flat Earth might be a possibility that

1194.67 --> 1200.8200000000002
should definitely be stopped

1198.05 --> 1204.4199999999998
that's like trauma-based mind control

1200.82 --> 1207.74
and that's that's just wrong no the

1204.42 --> 1210.8000000000002
world as it is is is already bad enough

1207.74 --> 1213.27
bad enough of peer pressure if ya don't

1210.8 --> 1215.45
don't do that kind of thing to a little

1213.27 --> 1215.45
kid

1218.05 --> 1224.6299999999999
but yeah I don't know I think flattered

1222.68 --> 1226.3100000000002
if this could problem be teachers at

1224.63 --> 1229.97
some point if they're just good enough

1226.31 --> 1233.6599999999999
of what they do and they keep their

1229.97 --> 1236.51
personal issues apart from their

1233.66 --> 1239.03
curriculum as it were and hopefully that

1236.51 --> 1242.09
curriculum will not be as infested with

1239.03 --> 1243.5
nonsense anymore for me that certainly

1242.09 --> 1247.34
would be a requirement

1243.5 --> 1249.02
you know I refused there would be so

1247.34 --> 1251.6299999999999
much in nonsense in between things now I

1249.02 --> 1255.77
think that I just would be I would rebel

1251.63 --> 1260.2600000000002
against it start to insert my own

1255.77 --> 1265.46
personal views very carefully you know

1260.26 --> 1268.82
not at any extreme [ __ ] but just from

1265.46 --> 1270.83
another angle it would be potentially

1268.82 --> 1273.4399999999998
experimental but it is what I kind of

1270.83 --> 1278.27
did my with myself and I think it's

1273.44 --> 1281.06
worth passing that on I think it will

1278.27 --> 1285.32
yield a lot of very capable people

1281.06 --> 1286.82
eventually so anyway but who knows you

1285.32 --> 1289.1
know maybe it's so boring I will be a

1286.82 --> 1290.21
teacher my dad even I had a phone call

1289.1 --> 1293.99
with my dad again

1290.21 --> 1297.26
happy birthday and all that and even

1293.99 --> 1300.41
said like yeah why don't you just do

1297.26 --> 1304.55
lectures about this stuff and I was like

1300.41 --> 1309.68
okay well I basically already do that

1304.55 --> 1311.6299999999999
I do that live on the spot but yeah if

1309.68 --> 1314.66
I'd ever like officially do lectures

1311.63 --> 1317.69
then I would have to have a book because

1314.66 --> 1320.3600000000001
and I've seen at Bennett lectures even

1317.69 --> 1322.8500000000001
before I went into flat earth with my

1320.36 --> 1326.0
accident like concerning dentistry and

1322.85 --> 1328.55
all that and medical stuff and yeah

1326.0 --> 1332.65
people would always come up to such

1328.55 --> 1335.21
person like do you have a book because

1332.65 --> 1339.14
that's just people out there that really

1335.21 --> 1342.32
are well at listening and there's other

1339.14 --> 1347.72
people that that absorb information much

1342.32 --> 1349.9099999999999
better reading so yeah then I before I

1347.72 --> 1350.47
do it before I go and do anything like

1349.91 --> 1352.51
that I

1350.47 --> 1356.5
I probably have to like somehow

1352.51 --> 1360.37
summarize my findings concerning

1356.5 --> 1362.85
cosmology nyan and probably also a big

1360.37 --> 1368.7399999999998
chunk of the psychology and spiritual

1362.85 --> 1373.78
elements and just try to describe what's

1368.74 --> 1378.61
going on right now and then see if I can

1373.78 --> 1381.34
yeah somehow get a decently readable

1378.61 --> 1383.05
piece of writing together with that I

1381.34 --> 1385.86
think it could probably do it over time

1383.05 --> 1388.81
I think I by now should have enough

1385.86 --> 1391.6
content in order to to really make it a

1388.81 --> 1398.35
worthwhile and not just a couple of

1391.6 --> 1401.08
pages but anyway it's a kind of a it's a

1398.35 --> 1404.28
new idea or it was kind of an old idea

1401.08 --> 1408.31
it's an old idea that's now starting to

1404.28 --> 1415.27
become more real that's started to get

1408.31 --> 1416.56
some kind of structure and yeah I don't

1415.27 --> 1419.08
know how long that's all going to take

1416.56 --> 1422.97
but I think that once I get into it

1419.08 --> 1422.97
it'll probably be done pretty quickly

1454.99 --> 1458.18

1462.06 --> 1465.23

[Music]

1522.54 --> 1531.6789999999999
well Stacey B what is gonna be next but

1526.77 --> 1534.24
I know I think that's probably just more

1531.679 --> 1539.3700000000001
spin doctoring and machinations and the

1534.24 --> 1543.74
wild stories that's probably gonna be

1539.37 --> 1543.7399999999998
the response overall it usually is

1545.55 --> 1549.5
[Music]

1552.41 --> 1561.8200000000002
yeah George Sanford I did take a look so

1558.8 --> 1561.82
it's been a while Gerda

1566.34 --> 1569.4599999999998
[Music]

1576.88 --> 1580.0690000000002
[Music]

1589.94 --> 1597.71
well tiny bumble we can definitely agree

1594.25 --> 1600.14
among ourselves about well most things

1597.71 --> 1603.5
especially concerning the globe right

1600.14 --> 1606.5300000000002
we just can't all agree on the tiny

1603.5 --> 1609.08
details cause of models and so many

1606.53 --> 1611.18
unknowns that we are honest about the

1609.08 --> 1613.01
unknowns most people are the most and

1611.18 --> 1616.7
others just set their minds on a very

1613.01 --> 1618.4
specific type of setup and that's the

1616.7 --> 1621.89
thing that we can't really agree upon

1618.4 --> 1625.46
but that's only because of the because

1621.89 --> 1628.46
of what is unknown and the nature of

1625.46 --> 1630.74
human beings of really one thing to have

1628.46 --> 1632.72
certainty as much as possible one thing

1630.74 --> 1636.6200000000001
to have a complete as complete picture

1632.72 --> 1641.3600000000001
as possible preferably with the least

1636.62 --> 1650.9599999999998
amount of effort because it does take up

1641.36 --> 1657.26
energy so yeah people have tendency to

1650.96 --> 1659.06
presuppose a lot it comes natural time

1657.26 --> 1664.58
we're taught to do it it's a mechanism

1659.06 --> 1667.04
we're taught it starts out with the

1664.58 --> 1669.6499999999999
imagination imagination is basically

1667.04 --> 1672.26
presupposing and then doing it

1669.65 --> 1674.5300000000002
effectively with your your conscious

1672.26 --> 1674.53
focus

1678.37 --> 1681.53
[Music]

1709.72 --> 1715.95
cruise to Antarctica goodie right

1720.65 --> 1722.68
ah

1753.53 --> 1760.87
Wow well sorry junkie boy but we're not

1757.28 --> 1764.51
all a bunch of rich people okay

1760.87 --> 1768.1699999999998
good luck with that why don't you go do

1764.51 --> 1769.9
it and you go prove your globe just know

1768.17 --> 1771.7
have fun you got all this money now

1769.9 --> 1776.6000000000001
right

1771.7 --> 1779.66
Global's on average have more money how

1776.6 --> 1783.34
does that possible hmm well doesn't

1779.66 --> 1783.3400000000001
really matter but you could do that

1814.53 --> 1820.5
this is I love it

1817.62 --> 1824.37
well that's a Freudian slip right there

1820.5 --> 1826.71
chunky boy yeah you know I was gonna

1824.37 --> 1830.0
tell you I think you're projecting but

1826.71 --> 1838.47
you already kind of made my point for me

1830.0 --> 1841.01
in this very sentences special it's very

1838.47 --> 1841.01
special

1848.44 --> 1851.589
[Music]

1859.66 --> 1867.779
[Music]

1871.96 --> 1879.07
yeah junkie boy I don't give a [ __ ] but

1875.98 --> 1881.619
you're supposed 24-hour some video or

1879.07 --> 1885.1
whatever but I've seen it was tricked it

1881.619 --> 1888.759
was cut that Antarctic Sun and even if

1885.1 --> 1891.82
there was I don't care even realized

1888.759 --> 1894.519
that on my model conceptualization of

1891.82 --> 1898.21
how the earth is that's a distinct

1894.519 --> 1901.179
possibility that that's there so doesn't

1898.21 --> 1905.1100000000001
really matter because I do not ascribe

1901.179 --> 1907.3300000000002
any geometrical orientation to the shape

1905.11 --> 1914.129
of the earth based on the celestial

1907.33 --> 1914.129
bodies it's very simple okay

1914.5 --> 1922.23
[Music]

1926.18 --> 1931.3100000000002
yeah junkie boy yeah it was brought up

1928.34 --> 1935.03
years ago like three years ago that came

1931.31 --> 1937.7
up between ballers and fletchers it was

1935.03 --> 1939.1399999999999
like videos made of that as far as proof

1937.7 --> 1941.3300000000002
of the ball blah blah blah when

1939.14 --> 1944.0600000000002
everybody was still a disc er most

1941.33 --> 1946.76
people I was still keeping my distance a

1944.06 --> 1948.8899999999999
bit and then they showed that video like

1946.76 --> 1958.24
a club Buster's and all other kinds of

1948.89 --> 1960.8000000000002
shows and yeah it was clearly edited so

1958.24 --> 1962.36
that's the video that I've seen about it

1960.8 --> 1965.57
who knows what's out there now it

1962.36 --> 1969.32
doesn't really matter to me because the

1965.57 --> 1973.6699999999998
Sun is not to me is not any kind of

1969.32 --> 1977.1499999999999
light ball that's it moving in a circle

1973.67 --> 1985.5500000000002
over a flatter disc okay that's not my

1977.15 --> 1987.95
problem you know I've even speculated

1985.55 --> 1989.51
like with what could be out there who

1987.95 --> 1992.45
knows at some point things will get

1989.51 --> 1995.93
weird and you'd see two or three suns or

1992.45 --> 1998.93
whatever well does that mean what does

1995.93 --> 2002.44
that yeah yeah that doesn't make any

1998.93 --> 2005.2
sense now does it not an any model in

2002.44 --> 2008.1100000000001
which you think the Sun is a physical

2005.2 --> 2009.8500000000001
literal thing in a specific point in

2008.11 --> 2012.82
relation to the Earth's surface or

2009.85 --> 2015.1299999999999
whatever right now it just becomes

2012.82 --> 2017.1699999999998
really weird optically then if that were

2015.13 --> 2021.64
to be the case but it could be you know

2017.17 --> 2023.6200000000001
have you ever heard of the fake Sun it's

2021.64 --> 2031.75
something that apparently happens at a

2023.62 --> 2034.12
certain is it latitude said to be like

2031.75 --> 2035.7
north of Norway and in the Arctic region

2034.12 --> 2040.0
there's a point where apparently

2035.7 --> 2042.1000000000001
sometimes you just get the Sun there's

2040.0 --> 2044.77
like a second Sun or whatever in certain

2042.1 --> 2048.64
periods that just looks like it hangs

2044.77 --> 2051.7
over the water absolutely close by like

2048.64 --> 2055.81
it's not even a mile away it just looks

2051.7 --> 2058.0499999999997
like that it's really creepy even so

2055.81 --> 2060.659
that is another

2058.05 --> 2063.659
sign another phenomena just tells me

2060.659 --> 2067.85
that the Sun is not which is it's all

2063.659 --> 2071.55
apparent saw light effect somehow and

2067.85 --> 2074.79
though who knows what else is out there

2071.55 --> 2076.8300000000004
weird effects why is concerning a sudden

2074.79 --> 2079.159
it's just not any object in any specific

2076.83 --> 2079.159
place

2085.62 --> 2091.46
no I did not make that up it's it's a

2087.87 --> 2094.3199999999997
piece of testimony have you ever read it

2091.46 --> 2098.58
there are small older stories out there

2094.32 --> 2100.28
about this this the fake some in the

2098.58 --> 2106.2
north

2100.28 --> 2106.77
very weird phenomenon I did not make

2106.2 --> 2110.3999999999996
that up

2106.77 --> 2112.92
don't don't you dare try to Gaslight me

2110.4 --> 2115.34
on that you don't even know what I'm

2112.92 --> 2115.34
talking about

2116.81 --> 2120.7999999999997
that's not first-hand information

2123.05 --> 2129.3900000000003
yeah well it's a story that was actually

2125.58 --> 2134.7
written down it was in the book where I

2129.39 --> 2139.92
D was it it's beyond the poles that

2134.7 --> 2142.5
story it's described in that one where

2139.92 --> 2147.27
they go to the north and eventually end

2142.5 --> 2151.08
up from the south back that very surreal

2147.27 --> 2155.07
story but very specific things and a

2151.08 --> 2159.12
phenomena suspension so yeah it's not

2155.07 --> 2162.5
proof it's not like confirmed testimony

2159.12 --> 2168.0899999999997
but there is something to it and just

2162.5 --> 2170.22
these phenomena alone you know what they

2168.09 --> 2171.81
did science fiction so no one did that

2170.22 --> 2177.14
just come out of nothing or is that a

2171.81 --> 2179.0299999999997
real thing get out of here body

2177.14 --> 2182.6
disgusting

2179.03 --> 2185.1800000000003
I don't even know why I even let these

2182.6 --> 2189.29
globo's hang around here you know as

2185.18 --> 2191.54
soon I take them serious I take them

2189.29 --> 2193.2799999999997
seriously respond to them I address them

2191.54 --> 2197.36
on their bad behavior and then when I

2193.28 --> 2201.7400000000002
just insert information and back it up

2197.36 --> 2205.21
they just get all disgusting like what

2201.74 --> 2205.2099999999996
the hell is wrong with you man

2208.24 --> 2211.3799999999997
[Music]

2227.42 --> 2230.9
yeah but that's why I'm not gonna read

2229.4 --> 2233.2400000000002
it out I'm just gonna ban them when they

2230.9 --> 2236.23
do it it's just that this is like the

2233.24 --> 2236.2299999999996
third person now

2250.85 --> 2256.46
well it might not be worth my energy but

2253.55 --> 2258.5
they were the only ones talking I don't

2256.46 --> 2261.8
know where you all have been the time

2258.5 --> 2263.89
witching randy's or whatever I don't

2261.8 --> 2263.8900000000003
know

2268.23 --> 2272.2400000000002
I don't know why is streaming over me

2313.25 --> 2315.28
Oh

2315.53 --> 2324.65
we know no trick footage goodie at least

2320.21 --> 2329.96
are trying to these are trying to fake

2324.65 --> 2332.11
their nonsense again no hey if you want

2329.96 --> 2336.23
to believe that it's all up to you but I

2332.11 --> 2338.9300000000003
don't know maybe it's just because I'm

2336.23 --> 2343.91
getting used to it but like what NASA

2338.93 --> 2346.46
does what they do and when they trick

2343.91 --> 2351.3199999999997
her out I do kind of appreciate what I

2346.46 --> 2353.66
really don't like about NASA the most is

2351.32 --> 2357.44
that they get so incredibly sloppy with

2353.66 --> 2361.25
things sometimes and whether that's on

2357.44 --> 2367.1
purpose it just seems that more could be

2361.25 --> 2369.89
done I don't necessarily mean that they

2367.1 --> 2371.8399999999997
could tricks proof that to completely

2369.89 --> 2375.71
confuse their arguments or something but

2371.84 --> 2377.57
that just so yeah it just seems like

2375.71 --> 2386.57
nobody's really into it anymore these

2377.57 --> 2390.8
days until the trickery because it is

2386.57 --> 2393.6200000000003
like a studio act most of it but yeah

2390.8 --> 2399.04
it's an act that's taken for real and

2393.62 --> 2401.75
like total wizardry it just seems like

2399.04 --> 2404.27
people doing it either can't handle it

2401.75 --> 2407.38
anymore with the Information Age or

2404.27 --> 2407.38
they're just not into it anymore

2408.42 --> 2411.489
[Music]

2412.06 --> 2417.02
right more colored yet that is all so

2414.56 --> 2420.32
it's almost like NASA has in a way

2417.02 --> 2424.27
become superfluous because the people

2420.32 --> 2428.06
are now have become their own defenders

2424.27 --> 2430.16
it's like people that believe in the

2428.06 --> 2432.77
globe don't even need NASA to convince

2430.16 --> 2436.16
them anymore they're just gonna do it

2432.77 --> 2439.73
themselves become their own spin doctors

2436.16 --> 2442.6099999999997
like rumpus because it can weirdly

2439.73 --> 2444.59
enough that can work in the ignorance in

2442.61 --> 2449.15
the belief in the suspense of disbelief

2444.59 --> 2450.86
you can actually continue building it is

2449.15 --> 2453.08
like a very mysterious

2450.86 --> 2456.4300000000003
it is like a mystery religion and it can

2453.08 --> 2459.08
I've done that myself believing in it

2456.43 --> 2462.14
not knowing that it's not real yet

2459.08 --> 2464.06
building it because it was like if I

2462.14 --> 2467.69
just get the right idea the right

2464.06 --> 2471.7999999999997
pattern then it will turn out to be the

2467.69 --> 2473.39
reality of it but yeah that's that's

2471.8 --> 2476.3
what that was like that's what probably

2473.39 --> 2482.2
perpetuates a lot of global that do have

2476.3 --> 2482.2000000000003
a creative mind to keep on working at it

2483.4 --> 2489.29
even though they're literally fooling

2487.28 --> 2493.2400000000002
themselves with it but that's just

2489.29 --> 2493.24
suspended that inside

2493.549 --> 2498.829
so yeah NASA it's almost like it's

2496.789 --> 2502.219
become a little superfluous like the

2498.829 --> 2505.159
they're more like the Ison on top or the

2502.219 --> 2509.299
cherry on top because the the believers

2505.159 --> 2510.829
themselves have become the cream they're

2509.299 --> 2515.589
the ones that put in all the energy that

2510.829 --> 2521.329
have all the passion to insane degrees

2515.589 --> 2523.7889999999998
it's weird how that works but I guess it

2521.329 --> 2525.949
was a natural side consequence of the

2523.789 --> 2529.9390000000003
Information Age if all the connectivity

2525.949 --> 2536.4790000000003
like things creep up very close to you

2529.939 --> 2539.979
so yeah you can't you have to become a

2536.479 --> 2543.459
defender of it if yours for yourself

2539.979 --> 2547.189
without purely relying on others or

2543.459 --> 2550.689
you're just gonna be swept away and and

2547.189 --> 2550.689
the suspense will be broken

2573.72 --> 2579.4289999999996
[Music]

2587.48 --> 2590.57
[Music]

2594.45 --> 2597.5299999999997
[Music]

2606.29 --> 2613.55
right well sometimes see like the globe

2609.95 --> 2617.93
conception is like a storytelling

2613.55 --> 2622.51
tradition where the speaker literally

2617.93 --> 2625.6699999999996
tries to convince themselves and others

2622.51 --> 2628.67
so it is really like a religion it is

2625.67 --> 2630.71
like a belief religion where you believe

2628.67 --> 2635.87
in something you don't understand but

2630.71 --> 2642.44
you understand the structures so it's

2635.87 --> 2645.95
like a belief based on a game on a giant

2642.44 --> 2648.68
puzzle a building game and that's seen

2645.95 --> 2650.1499999999996
as the preponderance of knowledge in you

2648.68 --> 2651.95
know that but that's just a cover story

2650.15 --> 2655.25
because if you look into it it's just

2651.95 --> 2657.62
all machinations but that's where the

2655.25 --> 2661.25
entire body of knowledge and everything

2657.62 --> 2663.17
is all then dragged into that that that

2661.25 --> 2666.11
all means that the earth is a globe

2663.17 --> 2670.25
that's what they do usually what most

2666.11 --> 2672.07
clubbers do at some point but has

2670.25 --> 2675.07
nothing to do with the actual globe

2672.07 --> 2675.07
conceptualization

2681.64 --> 2684.8199999999997
[Music]

2705.72 --> 2715.1099999999997
come on letter spaceman come down a bit

2708.69 --> 2717.59
I need to get old sweary bothers will be

2715.11 --> 2717.59
Boulder's

2719.32 --> 2727.4390000000003
[Music]

2736.97 --> 2741.8289999999997
yeah more colored yeah I remember the

2740.329 --> 2747.079
Martian I thought it was pretty good

2741.829 --> 2749.329
film actually was well done but the

2747.079 --> 2753.44
whole Mars conception right you know

2749.329 --> 2755.4500000000003
where the entire feel of what we've been

2753.44 --> 2756.099
presented as what Mars is where that

2755.45 --> 2760.31
comes from

2756.099 --> 2763.6400000000003
it's from the same team that built the

2760.31 --> 2765.44
the Mars what is it

2763.64 --> 2770.569
the Martian robot the Mars rover project

2765.44 --> 2773.48
that thing they made they set it there

2770.569 --> 2776.5099999999998
are the arbiters of Mars there they're

2773.48 --> 2780.47
the ones that really set what Mars is

2776.51 --> 2782.7200000000003
like in the story and everything else

2780.47 --> 2787.04
reflects upon that so every time I see

2782.72 --> 2789.2599999999998
something Martian you can just compare

2787.04 --> 2791.69
it to the footages that can be seen from

2789.26 --> 2794.03
that project that's supposed to be

2791.69 --> 2795.89
official and started it's been good well

2794.03 --> 2798.8
I think they read they turn it off or

2795.89 --> 2804.319
whatever but it's been going for a long

2798.8 --> 2807.98
time and that's what the Hollywood

2804.319 --> 2811.069
footage will be compared to and that's

2807.98 --> 2814.099
what will make also subconsciously for

2811.069 --> 2817.75
people will make it seem so real because

2814.099 --> 2817.75
it is just like the original

2818.349 --> 2828.2000000000003
determination of what Mars is like

2821.06 --> 2830.66
footage see how that works because it

2828.2 --> 2834.1299999999997
was basically decided upon this is what

2830.66 --> 2834.1299999999997
Mars is it's like this

2836.19 --> 2844.289
like that it's red red light red sander

2841.47 --> 2847.5589999999997
well it's been like mixed around a

2844.289 --> 2849.96
little here and there but yeah pretty

2847.559 --> 2852.3900000000003
much set the tone and also the location

2849.96 --> 2853.829
because you better believe that the Mars

2852.39 --> 2856.8289999999997
where it actually where you get to see

2853.829 --> 2860.4900000000002
the the robot drive around no that's a

2856.829 --> 2862.92
specific location somewhere the big

2860.49 --> 2868.5299999999997
fence around it a bad very very big

2862.92 --> 2872.869
fence and that is where Mars is on the

2868.53 --> 2875.2200000000003
earth so it is kind of consistent I

2872.869 --> 2877.71
don't know it might be in a giant studio

2875.22 --> 2879.77
for all you know most of it I don't know

2877.71 --> 2881.88
exactly where it is

2879.77 --> 2884.9
might be under I don't know it's

2881.88 --> 2884.9
probably not gonna be underground

2889.42 --> 2895.42
but that oh that whole thing set the

2892.06 --> 2898.23
tone for what Mars is like in the

2895.42 --> 2898.23
official story

2921.0 --> 2926.16
all right did you guys hear that

2923.42 --> 2930.42
supposedly iPhone is gonna stop

2926.16 --> 2933.92
producing iPhones is that just some

2930.42 --> 2933.92
weird rumor going down

2943.589 --> 2947.63
I don't know if it's true I heard it

2945.63 --> 2950.21
through left of a a couple of times I

2947.63 --> 2955.13
don't know what's going on

2950.21 --> 2955.13
[Music]

2961.75 --> 2969.84
yeah but more colored maybe there look I

2965.74 --> 2973.6299999999997
found an apple and the way they work

2969.84 --> 2975.81
they're kind of forcing people to become

2973.63 --> 2978.52
dependent on them it's kind of like a

2975.81 --> 2981.099
techno socialist system you could say

2978.52 --> 2983.98
and it has its advantages and

2981.099 --> 2987.34
disadvantages but what they will be more

2983.98 --> 2990.4900000000002
easily inclined to do then is to

2987.34 --> 2992.08
potentially force their entire base on

2990.49 --> 2993.91
another platform they've done this but

2992.08 --> 2996.31
they do this inherently even with their

2993.91 --> 2997.93
computers like at some point all their

2996.31 --> 3001.109
equipment even though it's technically

2997.93 --> 3004.5299999999997
still great strong everything functions

3001.109 --> 3006.72
just the software ruins it so you have

3004.53 --> 3009.63
to get the new [ __ ] so maybe they just

3006.72 --> 3011.0699999999997
want their people then if this true if

3009.63 --> 3014.15
the iPhone is going to cease maybe

3011.07 --> 3017.25
they're gonna force people into another

3014.15 --> 3020.2200000000003
format somehow maybe they're gonna bring

3017.25 --> 3024.63
out something new like I don't know like

3020.22 --> 3027.27
more iPod formatted situation with

3024.63 --> 3029.52
virtual interface or whatever but I

3027.27 --> 3033.5099999999998
don't know what they're gonna maybe or

3029.52 --> 3035.67
maybe they just maybe they just went

3033.51 --> 3037.44
really bad in the market and they're

3035.67 --> 3039.69
basically just cutting this program

3037.44 --> 3041.01
product often laying low whatever I

3039.69 --> 3043.02
don't know what's going on I'm not the

3041.01 --> 3046.38
expert at this thing it's just a rumor

3043.02 --> 3049.22
anyway what could be all kinds of

3046.38 --> 3052.28
reasons if they did that

3049.22 --> 3052.2799999999997
[Music]

3059.96 --> 3066.01
the brain I kid who knows

3070.18 --> 3075.1699999999996
although you know I think that this idea

3072.77 --> 3078.68
of brain chips is really kind of

3075.17 --> 3082.16
pointless so why would you need any of

3078.68 --> 3084.5589999999997
that when there is already pretty

3082.16 --> 3087.68
sophisticated interface capabilities

3084.559 --> 3094.13
without and you can surgical

3087.68 --> 3097.16
intervention you know technically when

3094.13 --> 3099.109
you have a chip well why don't they just

3097.16 --> 3101.0589999999997
make this chip and while though this all

3099.109 --> 3102.8289999999997
starts to sound really science fictiony

3101.059 --> 3104.69
but they could just make it like a

3102.829 --> 3108.02
sticker if you just put the sticker on

3104.69 --> 3110.869
and then it interfaces if you put it on

3108.02 --> 3115.579
the right spot like here buttons on

3110.869 --> 3117.349
yours whatever you know why would you do

3115.579 --> 3120.799
any kind of surgery that's just

3117.349 --> 3123.619
ridiculous to me it's not necessary

3120.799 --> 3128.67
anymore if you really want that kind of

3123.619 --> 3135.9
interfacing but yeah

3128.67 --> 3140.359
Oh a twit with people will do it right

3135.9 --> 3143.46
well people ate Tide Pods on camera

3140.359 --> 3145.98
people did ice bucket challenges and

3143.46 --> 3149.21
just the most ridiculous [ __ ] so yeah

3145.98 --> 3149.21
sure people will do that

3150.79 --> 3156.44
[Music]

3175.2 --> 3182.0989999999997
all right yeah it was supposedly for

3178.269 --> 3185.68
good cause but it's still kind of stupid

3182.099 --> 3187.63
there's worse example so I did but like

3185.68 --> 3190.529
the tight part to me is like one of the

3187.63 --> 3192.9990000000003
most revolting disgusting things I think

3190.529 --> 3196.9
but there's other things that I don't

3192.999 --> 3199.479
even want to describe people are just

3196.9 --> 3203.13
completely out of their materials like

3199.479 --> 3203.1299999999997
morally deranged

3216.12 --> 3222.81
right well the ice bucket challenge look

3219.07 --> 3226.3300000000004
as an act it's really kind of pointless

3222.81 --> 3228.61
but it did really echo on so it is like

3226.33 --> 3230.35
I remember that that happened I don't

3228.61 --> 3233.6800000000003
even know what it was about anymore but

3230.35 --> 3239.89
it was yeah that was very me me in a way

3233.68 --> 3245.9199999999996
but so much nonsense since then people

3239.89 --> 3248.83
doing things this idiotic licking

3245.92 --> 3252.9700000000003
products and putting them back on the

3248.83 --> 3257.17
shelf [ __ ] that for the like what the

3252.97 --> 3261.43
[ __ ] people why would anybody want to do

3257.17 --> 3264.91
that on camera it's just just one other

3261.43 --> 3268.27
example it goes in all directions just

3264.91 --> 3270.31
people do idiotic things for no good

3268.27 --> 3275.8
reason really but other than that

3270.31 --> 3277.93
they're bored or whatever just too deep

3275.8 --> 3284.1000000000004
down into the mud and they can't see

3277.93 --> 3284.1
anything so they just whack around

3285.79 --> 3291.58
doing crazy [ __ ] that makes no sense

3288.43 --> 3293.68
basically struggling to get out of the

3291.58 --> 3295.5099999999998
mud I guess even though they don't even

3293.68 --> 3298.6789999999996
realize it

3295.51 --> 3298.679
[Music]

3303.42 --> 3309.52
anyway I'm gonna round out to show guys
