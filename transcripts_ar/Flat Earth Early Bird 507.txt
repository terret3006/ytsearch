be much appreciated

65.11 --> 72.56
so today the weather is the difference

68.95 --> 77.39
it's more cloudy and certainly the winds

72.56 --> 81.46000000000001
back pretty heavily you see like all the

77.39 --> 84.459
flower petals drop because of this wind

81.46 --> 88.61
[Music]

84.459 --> 90.709
it's sunny but yeah because of the way

88.61 --> 94.819
that I guess it's become a lot fresher

90.709 --> 100.31
so I even put my warm rain and I got my

94.819 --> 105.59
sweater on because it's a bit fresh but

100.31 --> 111.649
still nice so yeah I got green tea with

105.59 --> 115.729
me let's see who is in chat on this

111.649 --> 119.42
Monday 13th of April 2020

115.729 --> 126.019
Monte Yayoi was first I remember ik

119.42 --> 130.849
flood yam I think Jane how do you say

Parker Walker Walker 78 yeah good to see

153.86 --> 156.76000000000002
you all

157.709 --> 172.39000000000001
so yeah very very very late night but

170.41 --> 176.769
yeah it's kind of cheated sort of

172.39 --> 180.48899999999998
because when it was still light I kind

176.769 --> 185.70000000000002
of went to bed I was like I got I know I

180.489 --> 188.019
got a sudden urge to sleep like Indy

185.7 --> 191.709
wasn't even evening yet was weird

188.019 --> 194.92000000000002
yesterday but it was good and yeah as a

191.709 --> 198.269
as a consequence I was up much much

194.92 --> 201.33999999999997
later like until think like 6 o'clock

198.269 --> 203.11
probably but still had plenty of sleep

201.34 --> 210.97
because with I just split it up and to I

203.11 --> 212.019
guess I have basically not smoked oh

210.97 --> 215.019
yeah

212.019 --> 215.59
not smoking anything yesterday not today

215.019 --> 219.88
either

215.59 --> 222.94
yesterday's might yeah it's like maybe 2

219.88 --> 226.54
euros worth of cannabis that's it

222.94 --> 229.6
but yeah it's I knew this was gonna

226.54 --> 232.06
happen and I'm okay with it and at the

229.6 --> 234.43
same time you have getting some weird

232.06 --> 236.739
issues although this may simply be like

234.43 --> 239.139
a temporary thing but for some reason

236.739 --> 242.91
like all the money that's been coming

239.139 --> 246.43
even through PayPal is got this delay

242.91 --> 248.319
very annoying so for some reason that

246.43 --> 250.989
PayPal donations are only going to go to

248.319 --> 256.44
my bank account the 17th for some reason

250.989 --> 256.44
from the recent few days like what's why

258.63 --> 266.8
but yeah I don't know I'm scurrying

264.13 --> 270.01
around and trying to lend some stuff

266.8 --> 271.72
that'll arrive him instantly because

270.01 --> 276.19
just the direct back-to-back transfer

271.72 --> 279.97
from friends and my dad even he gets it

276.19 --> 281.58
so I I'll survive but yeah I'm a little

279.97 --> 285.84000000000003
I'm a little hungry actually

281.58 --> 289.65
didn't really have yeah you know proper

285.84 --> 292.099
dinner still enough to get around and I

289.65 --> 296.27
still had a lot of packets a soup so I

292.099 --> 304.469
can at least eat some soup

296.27 --> 307.04999999999995
and yeah a little hungry hmm so I've

304.469 --> 315.599
kind of been just nibbling um um dry

307.05 --> 327.569
bread now storm in the north okay George

315.599 --> 330.87
Sanford so yeah I've got some flat earth

327.569 --> 331.819
related questions in the chat pretty

330.87 --> 334.86
early

331.819 --> 338.219
considering star positions I hope my

334.86 --> 339.99
answer cleared that up guess there's

338.219 --> 342.9
still people wondering like how can the

339.99 --> 345.029
stars be like this and like that in

342.9 --> 346.919
these locations it's like yeah it's

345.029 --> 350.4
because they're not in any literal

346.919 --> 355.65
position that's pre substitutional based

350.4 --> 359.17999999999995
thinking that is very yeah it's

355.65 --> 362.419
integrated into most people's thinking

359.18 --> 366.659
they that's like the first thing they

362.419 --> 368.909
imagine it as and that's been

366.659 --> 371.509
conditioned into us through the

368.909 --> 374.25
education system and through the

371.509 --> 380.909
heliocentric indoctrination over the

374.25 --> 385.77
times of the ages the century it's

380.909 --> 388.169
making you imagine things that we see to

385.77 --> 390.599
be specifically in a certain way in

388.169 --> 392.639
certain positions they make you

390.599 --> 396.18
presuppose that and you get so used to

392.639 --> 398.639
it that you don't even see it as a

396.18 --> 401.61
presupposition anymore and that's part

398.639 --> 407.15000000000003
of the reason why I'm here to dispel

401.61 --> 410.61
that to get through to your mind that

407.15 --> 415.44
these stars are not in any literal

410.61 --> 419.34000000000003
positions ever so there is no position

415.44 --> 423.69
a correlation as to where the angle of

419.34 --> 426.06
the stars are that matters for any kind

423.69 --> 427.2
of geometrical orientation of the realm

426.06 --> 430.47
at all

427.2 --> 433.84999999999997
there's no direct correlation with the

430.47 --> 437.46000000000004
geometry in the slightest

433.85 --> 440.58000000000004
only geometry concerning the heavens

437.46 --> 442.59
that that is there is the the angular

440.58 --> 445.28999999999996
relations in relation to the position of

442.59 --> 449.66999999999996
the earth and in the time the time

445.29 --> 452.1
that's passed that's it you just see him

449.67 --> 455.91
the Stars you see them at the edge of

452.1 --> 459.29
your vision they are not in any specific

455.91 --> 462.90000000000003
location the way you look there is no

459.29 --> 466.68
point of light like a little candle

462.9 --> 468.06
flame or a lamp in any exact position

466.68 --> 471.78000000000003
where you see that light coming from

468.06 --> 474.75
it's it's not there there is no literal

471.78 --> 476.48999999999995
thing there that shines that lie to you

474.75 --> 479.43
like some kind of flashlight that's not

476.49 --> 484.05
what they are they're just light

479.43 --> 486.21
manifests as far as I can tell can't be

484.05 --> 489.84000000000003
pinpointed they can't be traced they can

486.21 --> 493.88
be approached define where that lamp is

489.84 --> 496.40999999999997
actually literally at it's nowhere

493.88 --> 501.95
because they are not in literal

496.41 --> 501.95000000000005
positions it's just light manifest

503.27 --> 517.01
as far as can be figured out as far as

506.78 --> 519.289
can be confirmed well it's very simple

517.01 --> 523.55
tiny wubble how do I think I know this I

519.289 --> 526.01
know this by figuring out what I don't

523.55 --> 529.0699999999999
know and what nobody knows even though

526.01 --> 532.79
they think and pretend and imagine they

529.07 --> 537.98
know I take that away and then I get to

532.79 --> 540.709
what is actually real and then you draw

537.98 --> 543.74
certain conclusions as to hey well this

540.709 --> 546.1099999999999
data doesn't seem to be there so yeah

543.74 --> 548.9300000000001
there's only a few options left and

546.11 --> 552.5
they're not very straightforward they're

548.93 --> 554.51
not very tangible it's like literally

552.5 --> 557.24
the tangible factor a physical thing

554.51 --> 559.79
yeah it's not there there's no proof of

557.24 --> 562.73
that so what are you left to do you're

559.79 --> 565.0999999999999
just gonna pretend like it is in literal

562.73 --> 568.79
positions because you don't understand

565.1 --> 572.2090000000001
or are you just gonna take the data for

568.79 --> 575.06
what it is and stop imagining some kind

572.209 --> 578.3
of overlay framework based on

575.06 --> 582.9499999999999
presuppositions that's already been

578.3 --> 585.1099999999999
disproven because the lights are not in

582.95 --> 587.51
literal positions if they were you would

585.11 --> 591.17
be able to approach them in some way and

587.51 --> 594.85
get a proximity there is no evidence for

591.17 --> 594.8499999999999
this what so ever

596.2 --> 603.19
oh all right

601.06 --> 608.709
hey good servant yeah happy birthday I

603.19 --> 613.36
guess I see your your channel is

608.709 --> 615.7299999999999
gradually growing good yeah everybody in

613.36 --> 618.37
here if you haven't already go to gate

615.73 --> 620.47
servants channel your your unfortunately

618.37 --> 624.3100000000001
the go to channel function is gone now

620.47 --> 626.8290000000001
thank you - still gone so you're gonna

624.31 --> 628.9899999999999
have to actually look his leg up as

626.829 --> 632.05
literal channel or good servant if you

628.99 --> 635.17
want you could post the direct YouTube

632.05 --> 637.779
link to your channel and since you got a

635.17 --> 640.75
wrench posted in chat so people can go

637.779 --> 643.54
there directly to your channel link cuz

640.75 --> 645.13
they got to channel functions gone but

643.54 --> 649.81
that would be good and people could

645.13 --> 653.26
subscribe to you and you can yeah you

649.81 --> 657.04
can grow hopefully somewhere this year

653.26 --> 658.93
reach that thousand mark yes that's so

657.04 --> 659.4399999999999
you can yeah try to monetize things

658.93 --> 661.5999999999999
right

659.44 --> 663.0100000000001
you do want that right or you just want

661.6 --> 668.74
more subscribers I don't know I haven't

663.01 --> 674.31
even asked actually that's right there

668.74 --> 674.3100000000001
it is Bennett

675.46 --> 683.7900000000001
Bennett Stephens okay is that your

679.81 --> 683.79
actual name I didn't know that huh

702.48 --> 705.82
[Music]

706.399 --> 711.509
he doesn't think he knows he knows he

709.649 --> 718.639
knows okay

711.509 --> 724.0790000000001
I don't think Rob Skiba really knows I

718.639 --> 730.499
think he does think he knows you know we

724.079 --> 731.0889999999999
only have data unless you can yeah what

730.499 --> 735.379
is it

731.089 --> 739.35
miniaturize unless you could actually

735.379 --> 742.259
perfectly recreate the effect of looking

739.35 --> 744.629
out there and then seeing a dam I glow

742.259 --> 748.35
of stars and the Sun in the moon hey if

744.629 --> 749.939
Rob's kiba's managed to miniaturize that

748.35 --> 752.489
in some kind of model thingy and

749.939 --> 756.11
physically make that happen exactly like

752.489 --> 759.149
that then move

756.11 --> 761.369
congratulations he's broken the design

759.149 --> 767.009
code then I guess but I don't think he

761.369 --> 769.6990000000001
has so yeah he doesn't know he knows he

767.009 --> 769.6990000000001
thinks he knows

783.04 --> 789.019
[Music]

785.839 --> 789.019
Skype me

801.839 --> 809.4300000000001
I don't know who that is Anthony Dixon's

804.709 --> 813.959
Dickenson right so what did you do

809.43 --> 816.3
yesterday was there a big bear stream

813.959 --> 819.3599999999999
yes there was there was only though a

816.3 --> 821.0089999999999
very early one I think it was extremely

819.36 --> 823.499
early like my show

821.009 --> 827.22
I just finished and then I noticed like

823.499 --> 829.559
what he's going live yeah I did

827.22 --> 832.589
very very early so I yeah there was a

829.559 --> 834.87
nice little surprise right after my show

832.589 --> 840.36
yesterday to get on to own Benjamin's

834.87 --> 843.36
the alive and he talked about Easter and

840.36 --> 846.3000000000001
basically mentioned how Bible Savannah's

843.36 --> 850.47
are added again and like declaring

846.3 --> 851.9699999999999
everything satanic because their Bibles

850.47 --> 854.129
have on yes and that was kind of the

851.97 --> 856.6990000000001
point of his little stream I thought I

854.129 --> 856.6990000000001
was pretty good

862.6 --> 870.1
uh okay Anthony Dixon's Dickinson sorry

866.11 --> 873.07
yeah I I didn't I thought you could have

870.1 --> 878.16
taken things the wrong way or whatever

873.07 --> 884.74
it's I just thought you seemed a little

878.16 --> 888.13
confident about Rob Skiba having this

884.74 --> 893.4
specific knowledge but maybe I was wrong

888.13 --> 893.4
maybe that's not what you meant

897.16 --> 909.6899999999999
ah right so oh yeah then I hang yeah

906.129 --> 912.8190000000001
very late also I immense to watch a

909.69 --> 917.9200000000001
channel that's becoming slowly a

912.819 --> 921.8389999999999
personal favorite this rogue ways must

917.92 --> 928.329
have heard of her so she's a very

921.839 --> 931.0290000000001
intelligent woman that I kind of like in

928.329 --> 933.55
many ways and she's yeah it says open

931.029 --> 938.55
chat all kinds of people flat earther

933.55 --> 943.81
and very spiritually act very good and

938.55 --> 946.8
she has some very interesting guests on

943.81 --> 946.8
yesterday

952.93 --> 955.8889999999999
hello crows

970.46 --> 979.95
[Music]

971.9 --> 982.62
it's funny I think they must be like

979.95 --> 986.01
nesting because one seems to be feeding

982.62 --> 988.05
the other like through mouth the only

986.01 --> 990.9
reason I can think of why one crow would

988.05 --> 993.51
feed the other an adult crow through the

990.9 --> 997.47
mouth is if they were kind of like

993.51 --> 1001.9399999999999
pregnant so they probably are making a

997.47 --> 1004.88
nest somewhere a lot of birds are ah I

1001.94 --> 1009.5300000000001
got distracted yeah rogue ways yesterday

1004.88 --> 1013.76
she got Alec Eric dollar Tom and yet

1009.53 --> 1017.0799999999999
talked about a lot and she's also very

1013.76 --> 1020.03
well aware of like Rudolf Steiner

1017.08 --> 1023.99
spiritual laws kind of things very apt

1020.03 --> 1025.82
at it and yeah I almost wish like I

1023.99 --> 1029.51
could get her on the show or maybe I

1025.82 --> 1033.4099999999999
could get on her show sometime if she'd

1029.51 --> 1038.06
have me yeah Eric dollar has been around

1033.41 --> 1042.02
for a while and he's has some very smart

1038.06 --> 1044.03
insights I think I'm even subscribed to

1042.02 --> 1049.209
his channel let me check if this

1044.03 --> 1049.209
actually true I think I do

1057.21 --> 1060.769
[Music]

1061.28 --> 1071.27
I'm not eight hundred percent sure

1064.559 --> 1071.27
though subscribed yes yes I was

1079.92 --> 1087.51
yeah here's some interesting stuff Vinay

1084.57 --> 1089.7
he was on with her and about all kinds

1087.51 --> 1092.58
of things and it's just good to listen

1089.7 --> 1095.39
to like every time she's on it's it's

1092.58 --> 1095.3899999999999
always interesting

1105.43 --> 1108.8200000000002
what's going on

1117.05 --> 1124.8799999999999
Oh es P power that's just normal

1119.93 --> 1128.24
literally normal especially when I start

1124.88 --> 1131.1200000000001
out feeling kind of good and come then

1128.24 --> 1133.64
they pile on the dislikes because those

1131.12 --> 1135.86
freaking trolls out there know the real

1133.64 --> 1139.8700000000001
ones the ones that are actually making

1135.86 --> 1143.4199999999998
this into a long-term project that

1139.87 --> 1146.33
discourage me they want something very

1143.42 --> 1146.93
specific from me because they know where

1146.33 --> 1149.0
I'm at

1146.93 --> 1150.71
they can feel it they've seen it they

1149.0 --> 1153.23
know what I'm discovering about myself

1150.71 --> 1157.01
how I'm fixing certain issues and they

1153.23 --> 1160.31
know that my potential strength hasn't

1157.01 --> 1161.99
even I haven't even come to actually

1160.31 --> 1164.48
really showing it yet because I'm still

1161.99 --> 1166.91
dealing with so many issues and they are

1164.48 --> 1170.48
pushing it there they're pretty

1166.91 --> 1175.91
desperate to somehow get me to this

1170.48 --> 1178.94
court stone bed they want me to get

1175.91 --> 1181.8200000000002
pissed off get distracted and then start

1178.94 --> 1186.38
raging or something because when I rage

1181.82 --> 1190.61
vent off you know and then after that I

1186.38 --> 1192.89
get a bit flustered and yeah it takes

1190.61 --> 1195.05
some time to get back to your

1192.89 --> 1198.44
concentration after that like could take

1195.05 --> 1201.02
a day it's bad so they are trying their

1198.44 --> 1203.3600000000001
best to kind of turn me into rage when

1201.02 --> 1206.36
they just want rage win if I'm just

1203.36 --> 1208.7299999999998
Rachel in here and yeah then they're

1206.36 --> 1210.05
like Oh see that guy's just a total

1208.73 --> 1212.41
idiot now everybody will see you so

1210.05 --> 1216.05
total idiot is no longer a threat but I

1212.41 --> 1219.17
don't do that enough to their opinions

1216.05 --> 1223.73
they did they just think like this is

1219.17 --> 1228.77
not good why is he so calm and reserved

1223.73 --> 1230.93
so many times away why does he stick to

1228.77 --> 1235.8799999999999
the subject why doesn't he have doubts

1230.93 --> 1237.77
about the subjects he forwards why do we

1235.88 --> 1239.72
got it we got a downgrade this we got a

1237.77 --> 1242.99
pile on the downvotes we got to do

1239.72 --> 1247.6100000000001
whatever we can to somehow make him

1242.99 --> 1250.64
falter make him slip just a little bit

1247.61 --> 1256.25
they are very very desperate

1250.64 --> 1259.0400000000002
and the funny thing is I have a natural

1256.25 --> 1262.04
tendency to even like underestimate like

1259.04 --> 1267.59
yeah come on I'm just Arwen I'm just

1262.04 --> 1271.76
this guy I have no money you know most

1267.59 --> 1274.3999999999999
people will probably not even understand

1271.76 --> 1275.21
like 1/2 or 1/4 of what I'm saying in

1274.4 --> 1277.549
the first place

1275.21 --> 1280.19
even though they are on average

1277.549 --> 1285.1399999999999
considered smart it doesn't really

1280.19 --> 1289.0700000000002
matter they want me to just turn into

1285.14 --> 1292.73
rage win so that yeah so that I'm not a

1289.07 --> 1297.1399999999999
threat anymore and not a threat to build

1292.73 --> 1300.47
a legend of being right and coming up

1297.14 --> 1303.0200000000002
with subjects very early on and pushing

1300.47 --> 1305.72
it and then seeing it manifest in the

1303.02 --> 1307.22
world because people that don't pay

1305.72 --> 1309.08
attention that don't even know when I'm

1307.22 --> 1310.82
around they're just going to be

1309.08 --> 1311.75
confronted with the subjects anyway and

1310.82 --> 1313.52
then they're gonna take their own path

1311.75 --> 1315.35
probably going to be seduced into

1313.52 --> 1317.9
becoming a self Anja and by the you know

1315.35 --> 1321.62
to single subject and then completely

1317.9 --> 1323.419
misbehave but yeah when they take notice

1321.62 --> 1325.52
like hey there's this guy here they're

1323.419 --> 1327.71
just a daily show just him in front of

1325.52 --> 1330.08
the camera it seems kind of boring at

1327.71 --> 1331.669
times and monotonous right always

1330.08 --> 1334.24
wearing the same clothes always the same

1331.669 --> 1338.0300000000002
hair always the same background well

1334.24 --> 1341.809
when they actually look beyond that and

1338.03 --> 1344.059
start to listen to the details and me

1341.809 --> 1346.25
describing the details in my life even

1344.059 --> 1350.36
then after a while they start to notice

1346.25 --> 1351.77
they start to notice like this guy is on

1350.36 --> 1356.87
to a lot

1351.77 --> 1359.03
I see things coming I even share about

1356.87 --> 1361.9699999999998
these weird surreal experiences that I

1359.03 --> 1364.6689999999999
have of seeing into the future even

1361.97 --> 1366.53
though I could not use it but it's kind

1364.669 --> 1369.6200000000001
of floating bubbling up every now and

1366.53 --> 1371.6
then and I do see things coming it's

1369.62 --> 1374.75
just I can feel it coming I can see it

1371.6 --> 1376.6399999999999
coming sometimes very much off because

1374.75 --> 1379.429
I've been also bombarded during that

1376.64 --> 1382.5800000000002
experience with delusions and tricks a

1379.429 --> 1384.269
lot of them and I'm spotting more every

1382.58 --> 1388.85
single day

1384.269 --> 1393.029
they basically tried to drag me through

1388.85 --> 1396.99
almost the entire science fiction

1393.029 --> 1399.33
library storytelling television and all

1396.99 --> 1402.809
that that's out there almost everything

1399.33 --> 1407.73
I've been through scenes of almost every

1402.809 --> 1409.3799999999999
movie I've seen now and then the yeah

1407.73 --> 1412.23
the entities tried to trick me into

1409.38 --> 1414.69
thinking that it was real or that I was

1412.23 --> 1417.45
in those situations and they tried to

1414.69 --> 1419.3700000000001
drive me mad with it now that I've

1417.45 --> 1421.95
started to figure that out it's not just

1419.37 --> 1424.649
this giant curse of potential dangerous

1421.95 --> 1426.779
future for myself anymore I'm starting

1424.649 --> 1428.58
to recognize more and more of the things

1426.779 --> 1431.7
that were real that I've seen where the

1428.58 --> 1434.49
feelings would be different because

1431.7 --> 1437.97
nobody instructed me about that at all I

1434.49 --> 1441.24
owe all of it I had to figure out very

1437.97 --> 1444.809
slowly and gradually afterwards years

1441.24 --> 1447.36
and years afterwards because most of it

1444.809 --> 1449.19
I even just forgot right after I had the

1447.36 --> 1452.639
experience because I couldn't handle it

1449.19 --> 1454.1390000000001
oh yeah I have this foresight it's just

1452.639 --> 1457.049
in me it's become a part of me it's

1454.139 --> 1460.7099999999998
always been a part of me but it's also

1457.049 --> 1462.69
manifested in a more literal way it in a

1460.71 --> 1465.0
certain point whatever I have a

1462.69 --> 1469.3700000000001
foresight I just understand what is real

1465.0 --> 1473.13
what is not real and that that anchor

1469.37 --> 1476.82
that spiritual anchor in reality that is

1473.13 --> 1478.98
the big threat that is the big threat

1476.82 --> 1481.32
that is why they keep on piling the

1478.98 --> 1486.75
downvotes that's why they try to get rid

1481.32 --> 1490.049
of me because I am spiritually complete

1486.75 --> 1493.58
I am a person a real person with a real

1490.049 --> 1500.37
spirit I have not sold out I've

1493.58 --> 1505.49
sacrificed a lot to keep me being me a

1500.37 --> 1505.4899999999998
lot almost everything

1506.87 --> 1518.29
like social financial almost everything

1512.06 --> 1521.48
I to be me to be able to be me and

1518.29 --> 1524.8999999999999
that's a threat because yeah most of the

1521.48 --> 1527.8700000000001
squirt boys the trolleys they have no

1524.9 --> 1528.5
soul they gave they did exactly the

1527.87 --> 1532.04
opposite

1528.5 --> 1535.81
they gave everything about them up for

1532.04 --> 1540.31
social status for money for security

1535.81 --> 1544.1599999999999
they gave everything up so I am like

1540.31 --> 1546.6799999999998
their personal Antichrist that's how it

1544.16 --> 1550.0400000000002
feels to them like I did everything the

1546.68 --> 1552.65
opposite way and they cannot bear that

1550.04 --> 1557.1499999999999
there's somebody out there that survived

1552.65 --> 1560.45
that they don't want people to be able

1557.15 --> 1564.3200000000002
to choose that against it and survive it

1560.45 --> 1565.97
because they are so weak inside that

1564.32 --> 1568.31
they chose this they thought they

1565.97 --> 1572.8700000000001
couldn't survive they thought they were

1568.31 --> 1575.96
weak and then they became weak and then

1572.87 --> 1580.37
when somebody didn't use that and they

1575.96 --> 1583.3400000000001
survive it offends them because not

1580.37 --> 1589.9099999999999
being able to survive is what made them

1583.34 --> 1592.22
do it and they can't handle that so they

1589.91 --> 1595.66
will turn demonic and they will become

1592.22 --> 1599.75
obsessed obsessed with dragging me down

1595.66 --> 1602.8700000000001
doing what they to me what they imagine

1599.75 --> 1611.0
that they would go through if they were

1602.87 --> 1616.58
me isn't that ironic they become the

1611.0 --> 1620.39
fear they become the arm the actor of

1616.58 --> 1623.27
the fear that made them give up their

1620.39 --> 1626.6200000000001
soul they probably don't even

1623.27 --> 1626.62
consciously realize it

1636.639 --> 1643.7289999999998
so yeah keep it up trolls like I could

1640.669 --> 1646.009
have a million people or maybe a hundred

1643.729 --> 1650.96
million people a hundred millions

1646.009 --> 1654.44
quarters and Satanists and freaks to

1650.96 --> 1659.1490000000001
sign petitions to get me arrested for

1654.44 --> 1661.1290000000001
whatever I don't care just because they

1659.149 --> 1663.4399999999998
don't like me just because in some way

1661.129 --> 1664.2199999999998
they could they could call me a

1663.44 --> 1665.659
terrorist

1664.22 --> 1667.789
they call me could call me an

1665.659 --> 1670.0990000000002
eco-terrorist or maybe your covert

1667.789 --> 1672.32
Satanist that's actually out to destroy

1670.099 --> 1676.549
them they could imagine whatever they

1672.32 --> 1678.59
like they can because it doesn't matter

1676.549 --> 1679.1589999999999
to them anymore truth does not matter

1678.59 --> 1683.019
anymore

1679.159 --> 1685.729
when you give up your soul it becomes

1683.019 --> 1689.72
flexible so flexible that there's no

1685.729 --> 1694.009
more route becomes plastic no life in

1689.72 --> 1697.309
there so yeah they can think up whatever

1694.009 --> 1700.729
they want it'll actually make me thrive

1697.309 --> 1704.539
I think it'll actually give me more

1700.729 --> 1707.989
confirmation that yeah yeah that's right

1704.539 --> 1710.629
you're getting this and you need this

1707.989 --> 1714.349
this is a good sign it's a sign that

1710.629 --> 1716.509
you're doing something right if you be

1714.349 --> 1719.6899999999998
in a world where everybody agree with

1716.509 --> 1722.359
you everybody then you got a problem you

1719.69 --> 1725.269
got a problem for multiple reasons first

1722.359 --> 1729.71
one being if everybody always agrees

1725.269 --> 1731.869
with you always then that means they

1729.71 --> 1736.489
don't respect you they just want

1731.869 --> 1738.59
something from you or they want to they

1736.489 --> 1740.029
want something for them that's the only

1738.59 --> 1742.789
reason why everybody would agree

1740.029 --> 1747.109
everybody because anybody that wouldn't

1742.789 --> 1751.7
agree would fear to do it openly so then

1747.109 --> 1754.07
you have a tyrannical situation socially

1751.7 --> 1760.3890000000001
where you got yourself if everybody

1754.07 --> 1760.389
agrees yeah

1760.9 --> 1766.2800000000002
so I don't want everybody to agree

1763.79 --> 1769.28
I want criticism I want people to point

1766.28 --> 1772.04
me at mistakes when it seems like I'm

1769.28 --> 1775.79
not seeing those mistakes I want that oh

1772.04 --> 1780.01
yeah and I'll take it I'll take it I'll

1775.79 --> 1783.02
take it with pride and in thankfulness

1780.01 --> 1785.42
and then of course it does require

1783.02 --> 1787.34
actual understanding of Who I am what

1785.42 --> 1789.92
it's going on what I'm doing what the

1787.34 --> 1792.35
mistake is not just being a squirt boy

1789.92 --> 1793.76
just spouting out your [ __ ] you're this

1792.35 --> 1795.8899999999999
you're that you're good you're wrong

1793.76 --> 1799.43
your stupid letter that does that's not

1795.89 --> 1803.2700000000002
criticism it's just it's just at home

1799.43 --> 1813.5
[ __ ] based on nothing so that's not

1803.27 --> 1817.82
helping a debate with Simon and get the

1813.5 --> 1820.52
hell out of here man there's no debates

1817.82 --> 1823.1899999999998
with Simon dan Simon dan doesn't even

1820.52 --> 1828.47
know how to debate he's a complete

1823.19 --> 1833.0800000000002
cowardly idiot he's a [ __ ] I've never

1828.47 --> 1840.13
heard him say anything interesting ever

1833.08 --> 1845.06
why the hell would I give him a debate

1840.13 --> 1847.3400000000001
it doesn't deserve it you know if he

1845.06 --> 1850.1299999999999
wants to deserve a debate why doesn't he

1847.34 --> 1852.83
come on other people's Channel why does

1850.13 --> 1857.15
he only do things in his freakin

1852.83 --> 1860.4499999999998
disgusting little gamma safe space you

1857.15 --> 1863.3100000000002
know and I'm gonna do that

1860.45 --> 1866.48
it's a waste of my energy

1863.31 --> 1866.48
[Music]

1870.85 --> 1874.1999999999998
[Music]

1884.37 --> 1891.9099999999999
like Nathan oh you mean that Nathan

1890.08 --> 1896.9199999999998
doesn't go on other channels to debate

1891.91 --> 1901.23
he doesn't Dean really so what about all

1896.92 --> 1903.91
the times that he did do that you know I

1901.23 --> 1906.46
mean I hope you're not actually

1903.91 --> 1911.2
expecting a guy that is literally

1906.46 --> 1916.81
spending a full day's work full work

1911.2 --> 1920.47
days worth of hours on just his media

1916.81 --> 1923.11
situation his computer the program of

1920.47 --> 1927.58
his shows you really think he's just

1923.11 --> 1929.9799999999998
gonna yeah take a gap out of that day to

1927.58 --> 1933.09
start go on some baller channel and have

1929.98 --> 1936.97
a debate with them when he knows exactly

1933.09 --> 1941.32
what's gonna happen exactly you really

1936.97 --> 1943.44
think so no no he doesn't have time for

1941.32 --> 1946.9299999999998
that nonsense anymore but Nathan did

1943.44 --> 1949.24
actually debate ballers also on all

1946.93 --> 1954.72
their channels but yeah he's been too

1949.24 --> 1957.4
busy with his program on his channel and

1954.72 --> 1960.1000000000001
to be fair he doesn't really want to you

1957.4 --> 1962.52
know I don't even want I could I don't

really use this also yeah it sounds a

2152.01 --> 2155.94
bit grim but also to pay back things

2154.32 --> 2161.4
that at the head that I'd needed to

2155.94 --> 2162.3
borrow in the last weekend thank you so

2161.4 --> 2165.48
much man

2162.3 --> 2167.73
it's really appreciate I love you no

2165.48 --> 2170.52
homo you know that if you say no homo

2167.73 --> 2172.4900000000002
that's actually homo but I get your

2170.52 --> 2175.08
point

2172.49 --> 2178.1699999999996
at least that's what I own Benjamin says

2175.08 --> 2179.5499999999997
there's a point to it it's there's more

2178.17 --> 2181.5
a point to it when you don't know the

2179.55 --> 2183.51
person when they didn't start out saying

2181.5 --> 2186.03
I Love You Man no homo then it's like

2183.51 --> 2187.5
that's really gay thing to say when you

2186.03 --> 2190.4700000000003
don't really know the person then again

2187.5 --> 2194.93
I kind of do know you so but thank you

2190.47 --> 2194.93
one thank you so much cheers everyone

2195.77 --> 2203.07
how is this early bird if it's 2 p.m.

2200.25 --> 2210.6
your time Arwen well that's very simple

2203.07 --> 2215.3
I direct my show a lot on purpose is how

2210.6 --> 2217.89
I started it out to the United States

2215.3 --> 2219.96
and that's why I call it early because

2217.89 --> 2226.2599999999998
to the United States my show is pretty

2219.96 --> 2228.33
early and yeah since I'm not since I'm

2226.26 --> 2231.03
always trying to be very calm and just

2228.33 --> 2233.8199999999997
intellectual and all that it seems

2231.03 --> 2236.82
sensible to put that out for people

2233.82 --> 2239.34
early because later they've worked and

2236.82 --> 2242.28
all that and they more want action and

2239.34 --> 2244.08
just they want more rowdy stuff and

2242.28 --> 2246.09
that's not really me you know maybe the

2244.08 --> 2249.0
debates maybe do it the other debates

2246.09 --> 2250.7400000000002
get a little rowdy of course but so that

2249.0 --> 2252.75
that was kind of the plan it's like a

2250.74 --> 2255.1499999999996
breakfast show that was the idea or

2252.75 --> 2259.17
originally of the early bird show so

2255.15 --> 2262.32
that's why it's that time and as for my

2259.17 --> 2265.5
home time to pee mm so that time it just

2262.32 --> 2267.75
so happens to be a point in the day and

2265.5 --> 2270.36
I figured this out years ago

2267.75 --> 2273.51
even during the flat earth talks that

2270.36 --> 2279.9900000000002
during this time I seem to be like in

2273.51 --> 2282.3900000000003
the peak of the day energy wise so yeah

2279.99 --> 2282.83
every time I've done my show my flatter

2282.39 --> 2286.97
talk

2282.83 --> 2288.98
around 2:00 p.m. yeah it seemed to be

2286.97 --> 2291.98
like it's gone the best so that's why I

2288.98 --> 2294.86
kind of stuck to this time and not say

2291.98 --> 2298.52
much later because for example in

2294.86 --> 2301.7000000000003
between 5 o'clock and 8 o'clock I tend

2298.52 --> 2305.81
to be less alert I've gotten a lot

2301.7 --> 2309.08
distracted and all that oh wow thank you

2305.81 --> 2311.45
Guns of Navarone enough around RMP for

2309.08 --> 2314.69

2358.16 --> 2366.04
shipping a donation however I been I'm

2360.17 --> 2369.65
doing quite well actually it's been a

2366.04 --> 2373.22
while for my doing quite well you've

2369.65 --> 2376.28
yeah I've had I have my hard moments

2373.22 --> 2380.8999999999996
especially during the winter had a bit

2376.28 --> 2382.9700000000003
of a rough time everybody knows but

2380.9 --> 2386.33
right now especially since the spring

2382.97 --> 2388.3999999999996
broke I feel pretty good on average and

2386.33 --> 2394.19
I've come to some personal realizations

2388.4 --> 2396.32
I am focusing more on compacting not

2394.19 --> 2402.91
letting myself wander off and I'm trying

2396.32 --> 2402.9100000000003
to wean myself off smoking and drinking

2403.3 --> 2411.26
and I think it's already doing a lot of

2407.24 --> 2413.5099999999998
good that I am yeah doing great thanks

2411.26 --> 2427.9100000000003
for asking for like popping by hope you

2413.51 --> 2429.5
are doing alright oh oh why there was

2427.91 --> 2432.62
another op thing by the way little

2429.5 --> 2435.92
detail like yesterday's show was very

2432.62 --> 2441.08
long show very elaborate a lot of

2435.92 --> 2444.23
subjects like that I remember I talked

2441.08 --> 2449.35
about how there are elements inside of

2444.23 --> 2452.15
you that are like Devils and you have to

2449.35 --> 2454.49
you have to overcome them or they will

2452.15 --> 2456.98
overcome you and how some people then

2454.49 --> 2460.91
try to personify that as outside

2456.98 --> 2464.06
entities and all that well guess what

2460.91 --> 2467.27
there was so deserve I watched more Star

2464.06 --> 2471.44
Trek the original series and like the

2467.27 --> 2474.2599999999998
next episode I watched it described

2471.44 --> 2476.93
pretty much everything I said yesterday

2474.26 --> 2479.09
of the show about that it described like

2476.93 --> 2481.79
the inner workings they did this weird

2479.09 --> 2484.4300000000003
split apart splitting up into different

2481.79 --> 2487.16
characters but very well thought out

2484.43 --> 2489.5
like one was the ego the devil inside

2487.16 --> 2492.14
the other was just the gentleness but

2489.5 --> 2495.73
without the wheel it was fascinating

2492.14 --> 2499.1299999999997
that you see an a Star Trek episode from

2495.73 --> 2501.71
70 years ago that would actually

2499.13 --> 2504.35
content-wise reflect the thing that I

2501.71 --> 2510.13
tried to bring across yesterday I wasn't

2504.35 --> 2510.13
just blown away by that it's crazy

2511.119 --> 2517.719
I talk about it I think about it I

2514.569 --> 2520.869
describe it and then that evening I see

2517.719 --> 2528.039
it in this super old sci-fi series it's

2520.869 --> 2531.7000000000003
like what really yeah

2528.039 --> 2534.3390000000004
it's pretty astonishing to me oh by the

2531.7 --> 2536.319
way thank you Walker Walker r78

2534.339 --> 2544.15
for the two pound super chair donation

2536.319 --> 2546.7
much appreciated no Anthony Dixon's

2544.15 --> 2548.7690000000002
Dickenson I keep my only you Dixon's I

2546.7 --> 2551.6499999999996
don't know why that's all right if you

2548.769 --> 2556.1699999999996
don't have anything to share or despair

2551.65 --> 2559.2690000000002
then please don't you know I'd be

2556.17 --> 2562.869
slightly offended if you would like give

2559.269 --> 2565.029
your last bottom dollar to me because

2562.869 --> 2567.819
I'm asking for the nation's I don't want

2565.029 --> 2569.769
that you know if you got if you got

2567.819 --> 2571.69
money to spare you know it's like it's

2569.769 --> 2574.0589999999997
like fountaining all over the place

2571.69 --> 2576.46
because you're scoring sure I'll take it

2574.059 --> 2580.059
absolutely whatever you can spare

2576.46 --> 2582.549
but please don't give your last dollar

2580.059 --> 2585.219
to me just because you like me so much

2582.549 --> 2586.029
you're it because I seemed like I needed

2585.219 --> 2591.7000000000003
to get around

2586.029 --> 2597.039
I don't need it that much okay but I do

2591.7 --> 2598.8999999999996
appreciate it when people donate just

2597.039 --> 2601.1800000000003
don't give your last dollar away to me

2598.9 --> 2605.44
please please use it yourself I'd rather

2601.18 --> 2608.609
have you live a little longer and maybe

2605.44 --> 2609.969
get a chance to make some more you know

2608.609 --> 2618.21
all right

2609.969 --> 2618.21
oh here he comes again is this

2619.22 --> 2627.5899999999997
you see that kind of question that that

2622.97 --> 2634.64
kind of asks for a timeout because why

2627.59 --> 2636.77
would anyone at this point ask that but

2634.64 --> 2639.89
you just you just want clips of me

2636.77 --> 2645.92
saying that it do you yes

2639.89 --> 2648.35
I want this yes I want this no now you

2645.92 --> 2652.6
know the answer to that question I'm not

2648.35 --> 2654.98
gonna answer a question just like a

2652.6 --> 2657.5899999999997
because it almost sounds like the

2654.98 --> 2660.29
[ __ ] [ __ ] that police officers are

2657.59 --> 2664.82
supposedly AtTask like do you have any

2660.29 --> 2666.68
illegal drugs with you like really how

2664.82 --> 2670.2200000000003
doesn't asking that question make any

2666.68 --> 2672.2599999999998
damn sense there may be a sort of

2670.22 --> 2675.7099999999996
psychological thing to it but in here

2672.26 --> 2678.92
that makes no damn sense because you

2675.71 --> 2683.48
know where I stand with this and if you

2678.92 --> 2687.17
don't then just watch a episode don't

2683.48 --> 2689.39
get in here like oh it is a new guy with

2687.17 --> 2690.23
a flat earth early bird show I've never

2689.39 --> 2692.87
seen him before

2690.23 --> 2696.79
let's go in chat and ask him if he's

2692.87 --> 2700.0099999999998
Affleck or third oh really you think so

2696.79 --> 2703.39
you think so no no if you're gonna ask

2700.01 --> 2703.3900000000003
that you're gonna get a timeout Oh

2708.369 --> 2714.819

seems like your work time died by

2799.299 --> 2802.92
accident please don't take offense

2807.51 --> 2813.13
that's okay it happens good servant you

2810.49 --> 2815.89
know especially when the chats more

2813.13 --> 2817.75
active sometimes happen that you you

2815.89 --> 2820.96
just want to click on the three dots and

2817.75 --> 2823.059
quickly go to remove or something and

2820.96 --> 2824.619
then suddenly it's crawls up right as

2823.059 --> 2825.76
you click but you still have the

2824.619 --> 2827.4100000000003
automated routine and then you

2825.76 --> 2829.96
accidentally timeout the wrong person

2827.41 --> 2834.52
I've done it before myself so I know

2829.96 --> 2837.13
what you mean yeah yeah thank you are as

2834.52 --> 2838.809
you are making it rain on me and I don't

2837.13 --> 2843.01
know it's the kind of rain that I like I

2838.809 --> 2844.599
guess although as long as it's not in

2843.01 --> 2847.96
the form of nickels that would kind of

2844.599 --> 2850.619
hurt a hundred euros worth of nickels on

2847.96 --> 2850.619
top of your head

2857.049 --> 2860.439
it is nothing to me just remember I said

2859.779 --> 2864.13
okay

2860.439 --> 2867.5389999999998

2870.489 --> 2876.929
around for your business again sucks is

2873.569 --> 2881.2889999999998
there are there aren't there any other

2876.929 --> 2885.5190000000002
sources you could like you can change

2881.289 --> 2887.679
your source for these materials to keep

2885.519 --> 2890.8289999999997

2887.679 --> 2892.539
financially unviable I don't know you

2890.829 --> 2898.539
probably do I just hope things turn

2892.539 --> 2904.1400000000003
around and yes you did say I would help

2898.539 --> 2904.1400000000003
when again I remember it's okay

2909.12 --> 2912.19
[Music]

2920.56 --> 2923.94
[Music]

2924.41 --> 2931.8799999999997
Wow I got 50 for watching right away

2927.529 --> 2936.349
it's pretty awesome 30% 30%

2931.88 --> 2939.44
oh that's 30% of the super chat

2936.349 --> 2941.42
donations right that's right

2939.44 --> 2943.25
they take 30% but yeah there's another

2941.42 --> 2944.96
effect to it though I've explained it

2943.25 --> 2949.369
before and that is since I still live

2944.96 --> 2953.509
off social welfare and I have to report

2949.369 --> 2955.13
my income from Google the eventual super

2953.509 --> 2957.2
chats are thank you for the nickel good

2955.13 --> 2959.96
serve the eventual super chats that

2957.2 --> 2963.6189999999997
arrive will go on to the income pile and

2959.96 --> 2966.17
yeah unfortunately they take like 98% of

2963.619 --> 2969.8900000000003
that away again it's just attractive for

2966.17 --> 2972.289
my social welfare it's still okay I

2969.89 --> 2974.44
guess for the stats because if I'd had

2972.289 --> 2977.6600000000003
no income whatsoever they'd probably

2974.44 --> 2981.109
start complaining a little bit more on

2977.66 --> 2985.5789999999997
go ahead so it's not completely useless

2981.109 --> 2988.549
in that sense it's good for the stats so

2985.579 --> 2991.1600000000003
that I kind of seem employed enough to

2988.549 --> 2992.99
them as it were but if you really want

2991.16 --> 2994.67
to help me financially in a more direct

2992.99 --> 2995.1499999999996
way than PayPal is always the best

2994.67 --> 2998.9900000000002
option

2995.15 --> 3000.4
and so is patreon so but yeah that's

2998.99 --> 3004.769
still okay if you want a super chat

3000.4 --> 3004.7690000000002
donate that's that's perfectly fine so

3005.789 --> 3011.65
thank you it let's get back to some

3009.97 --> 3013.779
subject because just talking about

3011.65 --> 3016.6800000000003
PayPal all days it's not gonna really

3013.779 --> 3016.68
make a good hangout

3018.99 --> 3022.22
[Music]

3029.579 --> 3040.549
what are they doing yesterday right

3035.299 --> 3045.0389999999998
that's oh yeah what Star Trek I guess I

3040.549 --> 3045.0389999999998
already went through everything hmm

3052.68 --> 3061.8999999999996
crocuses yes yes yes George Sanford I

3057.52 --> 3067.839
think that most people do see that but

3061.9 --> 3072.4
unfortunately fake things being fake it

3067.839 --> 3074.589
doesn't seem to be a standard well it is

3072.4 --> 3076.329
a standard thing now it's just it

3074.589 --> 3078.43
doesn't give a standard for sponsor

3076.329 --> 3080.92
anymore that people just outright reject

3078.43 --> 3083.5589999999997
it because they're already used to going

3080.92 --> 3087.099
along to get along so they're just like

3083.559 --> 3090.88
okay the crude measures okay we'll just

3087.099 --> 3093.55
do it then I can keep it going and it

3090.88 --> 3095.98
will until you can't keep it going

3093.55 --> 3101.079
anymore and there's already some signs

3095.98 --> 3103.7400000000002
out there that yeah that certain places

3101.079 --> 3110.98
it's becoming it's becoming completely

3103.74 --> 3113.89
enviable so it can be shared a folder I

3110.98 --> 3114.069
guess there's no folder in the Flat

3113.89 --> 3117.819
Earth

3114.069 --> 3122.44
early-bird chat so see if I can share

3117.819 --> 3127.69
that it's pretty freaky it's apparently

3122.44 --> 3130.17
the American Karuna penalties and all

3127.69 --> 3130.17
that lets

3135.35 --> 3146.0299999999997
what no no not again come on man

3142.33 --> 3148.5699999999997
why oh yeah yeah of course I remember

3146.03 --> 3148.57
why

3164.33 --> 3168.2599999999998
okay how do I do this

3172.869 --> 3177.6600000000003
sorry I have to edit this [ __ ] for a

3175.359 --> 3177.66
moment

3193.12 --> 3196.23
come on

3205.49 --> 3219.52
okay this is not helping no no no sorry

3215.81 --> 3219.52
this is taking way too long

3235.37 --> 3238.15
right

3242.5 --> 3253.19
okay this is more like it right so here

3246.82 --> 3260.4100000000003
are some really messed up things that

3253.19 --> 3264.7400000000002
yeah that are being pushed there's like

3260.41 --> 3267.0099999999998
yeah money penalties now apparently in

3264.74 --> 3272.2099999999996
some regions they put this out

3267.01 --> 3272.42
it's insane insane rules and I don't get

3272.21 --> 3280.27
it

3272.42 --> 3283.94
this is like this [ __ ] here is is

3280.27 --> 3286.28
basically bad enough to respond with a

3283.94 --> 3289.54
revolution in my personal opinion you

3286.28 --> 3293.5400000000004
know if a county would shove this [ __ ]

3289.54 --> 3296.27
down everybody's throat I I round up

3293.54 --> 3301.69
every single person you know get the

3296.27 --> 3305.12
guns surround the county arrest them

3301.69 --> 3307.46
just bang now would be good to get the

3305.12 --> 3310.16
sheriff in on that by the way probably

3307.46 --> 3312.08
essential that you get him because this

3310.16 --> 3315.23
is insane

3312.08 --> 3319.61
this is beyond this is like an assault

3315.23 --> 3323.03
this is this is what an empire does when

3319.61 --> 3326.33
it conquers a new country that's what it

3323.03 --> 3330.2900000000004
does this kind of thing it makes

3326.33 --> 3333.86
everything impossible it enslaves people

3330.29 --> 3339.2599999999998
with insane rules making them give up

3333.86 --> 3342.55
everything they build that is united

3339.26 --> 3342.55
arab is it tank

3350.48 --> 3355.67
right anyway did this just my personal

3353.24 --> 3358.6299999999997
view you know if if some kind of city or

3355.67 --> 3361.78
a county would shove this [ __ ] into

3358.63 --> 3367.78
people's face it's time for a revolution

3361.78 --> 3367.78
it's time to take it down arrest them Oh

3367.97 --> 3378.29
a United Arab Emirates okay that makes

3374.839 --> 3380.27
sense that makes a little bit more sense

3378.29 --> 3383.93
because if this was the United States

3380.27 --> 3386.66
that would be just too crazy man yeah

3383.93 --> 3388.8199999999997
the United to Emory Iran Arabic Emirates

3386.66 --> 3392.39
that's analog that's that's a

3388.82 --> 3395.3
dictatorship anyway how come you don't

3392.39 --> 3399.65
see me because I'm showing this this

3395.3 --> 3401.8390000000004
folder thing I'll get back to you but I

3399.65 --> 3407.06
just wanted to show like that that type

3401.839 --> 3411.07
of [ __ ] is being rolled out and it's

3407.06 --> 3415.63
kind of revolution worthy you know I

3411.07 --> 3420.88
wouldn't take that [ __ ] absolutely not

3415.63 --> 3423.8900000000003
get your Molotov cocktails maybe not

3420.88 --> 3426.98
maybe save them for the 5g towers or

3423.89 --> 3430.0989999999997
something but yeah that [ __ ] is just

3426.98 --> 3433.9
it's an assault it's an assault on

3430.099 --> 3437.75
business on people it's insane

3433.9 --> 3440.619
should not be tolerated at all not even

3437.75 --> 3440.619
a little bit

3446.49 --> 3450.4599999999996
yeah that's right Shawn thorny oh that I

3449.38 --> 3452.86
almost forgot

3450.46 --> 3457.15
and anybody see red pail philosophies

3452.86 --> 3461.1
video yesterday was so telling was so

3457.15 --> 3466.4500000000003

3461.1 --> 3469.56
it was so good I shared it in the early

3466.45 --> 3470.77
bird chat too by the way let's see if I

3469.56 --> 3475.42
yeah

3470.77 --> 3480.21
no wait that's another one I also

3475.42 --> 3480.21
watched a really really fantastic

3480.33 --> 3487.36
documentary video on YouTube that Nathan

3485.23 --> 3491.38
Thompson shared with me and I shared it

3487.36 --> 3494.92
with my dad because it was really good

3491.38 --> 3498.34
was a farming it was about farming it

3494.92 --> 3500.17
was about soil and how to cultivate soil

3498.34 --> 3502.42
and how soil has been destroyed with

3500.17 --> 3504.82
everything about soil it's so good

3502.42 --> 3507.4
anyway this video is not it this is red

3504.82 --> 3510.46
pill philosophies video it's very funny

3507.4 --> 3514.4500000000003
is like force 4 minute 16 and it's all

3510.46 --> 3516.4900000000002
the corona the news of all the terrible

3514.45 --> 3520.48
situation and then in the background

3516.49 --> 3523.6299999999997
playing all the nurses and doctor dance

3520.48 --> 3526.51
videos that have been coming out in the

3523.63 --> 3529.3900000000003
recent months it's freakin hilarious

3531.43 --> 3536.47
comment so if you see my comment and

3532.9 --> 3539.44
please upload it to you know but yeah

3536.47 --> 3544.6299999999997
great video from recto philosophy now

3539.44 --> 3548.89
the other one is much much longer it's

3544.63 --> 3552.79
really a full-blown documentary there's

3548.89 --> 3555.1299999999997
one hour 46 minutes it is everything

3552.79 --> 3557.44
about farming and soil and just watching

3555.13 --> 3561.1
that video it almost made me cry it made

3557.44 --> 3564.31
me cry because look I want that I want

3561.1 --> 3567.67
that haha

3564.31 --> 3569.98
I want soil I want to do it right I want

3567.67 --> 3573.85
the plants ah I want chickens

3569.98 --> 3575.83
ah what's so good it's like it's kind of

3573.85 --> 3577.93
like what Owen Benjamin does but by a

3575.83 --> 3578.77
guy that's been like a professional in

3577.93 --> 3582.0699999999997
this

3578.77 --> 3584.83
like a dedicated spiritual godly very

3582.07 --> 3587.6200000000003
godly person all throughout the video

3584.83 --> 3591.25
godly person has been doing this his

3587.62 --> 3593.98
entire life it's fantastic this is such

3591.25 --> 3597.25
a quality video so good I downloaded it

3593.98 --> 3599.68
on my computer I burn this on a CD or a

3597.25 --> 3604.26
DVD because it is that good it is

3599.68 --> 3607.6299999999997
critical this video is one of the best

3604.26 --> 3609.61
documentaries I seen a long time made on

3607.63 --> 3613.1800000000003
YouTube it's for me personally it's like

3609.61 --> 3616.48
at the same level of quality as was it

3613.18 --> 3619.66
the earlier videos about how to use

3616.48 --> 3623.44
cannabis and cannabis oil to cure cancer

3619.66 --> 3626.7999999999997
I think it is to that quality level and

3623.44 --> 3629.77
yeah and that video came out like 10

3626.8 --> 3633.67
years ago this video is more recent it

3629.77 --> 3635.32
is really good watch it what as much of

3633.67 --> 3637.75
it as you can if you just watched 20

3635.32 --> 3640.4500000000003
minutes you'll be blown away I I only

3637.75 --> 3641.52
watched 20 minutes and I'm blown away

3640.45 --> 3645.8199999999997
already

3641.52 --> 3649.54
so yeah it's awesome watch this video it

3645.82 --> 3655.69
is so critical and he actually knows so

3649.54 --> 3660.58
much about it that he's offered a vision

3655.69 --> 3664.15
that basically says yes we can build

3660.58 --> 3667.15
soil you can grow it it doesn't have to

3664.15 --> 3669.4
be destroyed gradually over time as it

3667.15 --> 3674.23
has happened in history it can actually

3669.4 --> 3677.5
be grown and that's exactly what I

3674.23 --> 3683.31
wanted that's exactly what I want I want

3677.5 --> 3689.32
freaking high quality forest level soil

3683.31 --> 3693.64
everywhere everywhere [ __ ] deserts make

3689.32 --> 3695.86
it into a giant soil forest and the

3693.64 --> 3698.5299999999997
funny thing is if you do it right you

3695.86 --> 3702.36
could actually do it you can actually

3698.53 --> 3706.51
turn an entire desert into a giant

3702.36 --> 3711.2400000000002
wealthy forest slash organic farm the

3706.51 --> 3714.1000000000004
entire thing it could be done

3711.24 --> 3716.2299999999996
because soil does not have to run out

3714.1 --> 3719.62
you can actually grow it and this guy

3716.23 --> 3722.38
knows how and it's freaking amazing so

3719.62 --> 3724.99
watch the video watch the video the last

3722.38 --> 3737.1400000000003
link that I did watch it I'm gonna post

3724.99 --> 3738.91
it again watch the video alright anyway

3737.14 --> 3741.7599999999998
I am gonna round out the show because

3738.91 --> 3743.77
it's 3 o'clock and the Flat Earth debate

3741.76 --> 3746.05
should start up any second so yeah

3743.77 --> 3747.7
thanks for coming everyone I hope you

3746.05 --> 3750.6400000000003
like this video I certainly did I

3747.7 --> 3754.3199999999997
thought it was a great show today barely

3750.64 --> 3756.49
any silent moments have been very sober

3754.32 --> 3757.78
because I barely smoked anything I

3756.49 --> 3759.97
haven't smoked anything before the show

3757.78 --> 3762.4900000000002
okay and yeah

3759.97 --> 3767.83
I proved my point I proved my point

3762.49 --> 3769.39
yesterday or I tested that yeah it seems

3767.83 --> 3771.91
that the times the way I didn't have

3769.39 --> 3774.67
anything to smoke I perform better I

3771.91 --> 3777.3599999999997
hate it though cuz I like smoking I like

3774.67 --> 3780.4
the feel of it but it seems like it is

3777.36 --> 3784.42
it's like detriment to my overall

3780.4 --> 3788.14
performance and I guess I've proven that

3784.42 --> 3790.81
again today so we'll see where it goes

3788.14 --> 3792.49
anyway if you liked the video then
