108.479 --> 110.78
beautiful

111.06 --> 115.07900000000001
little ladybug crawling there on the

113.52 --> 118.86
window

115.079 --> 121.13999999999999
yeah you can see that I think it's

118.86 --> 123.119
it's right there

121.14 --> 125.119
oh yeah you can see a little dot there

123.119 --> 128.88
right

125.119 --> 130.979
but yeah it's beautiful blue sky

128.88 --> 133.56
I thought there was going to be trailing

130.979 --> 135.98000000000002
but I don't know it's not really leaving

133.56 --> 135.98
anything

137.76 --> 143.89999999999998
so it's a beautiful clear day almost no

141.239 --> 143.9
wind at all

144.0 --> 147.44
sun shining bright

147.959 --> 152.599
and it's feeling just a little bit more

150.0 --> 152.599
like spring

154.62 --> 157.52
it's really beautiful

164.34 --> 168.08
all right

165.9 --> 168.08
foreign

170.66 --> 176.879
it's Monday the 13th of February 2023

180.66 --> 188.72
temperature 12 degrees according to this

184.92 --> 188.72
12 degrees Celsius huh

190.68 --> 197.459
with an all sunny day it's funny how

193.7 --> 199.67999999999998
that wasn't there in the prediction a

197.459 --> 202.62
few days ago and now it is

199.68 --> 203.70000000000002
just goes to show that it's just an

202.62 --> 207.62
estimate

203.7 --> 207.61999999999998
every time it's just an estimate

207.9 --> 212.4
anyway

210.18 --> 216.239
it's beautiful weather I'm enjoying it a

212.4 --> 219.54
lot I feel great this morning

216.239 --> 221.72
just had yesterday still was just kind

219.54 --> 221.72
of

222.599 --> 225.56
unpleasant

225.84 --> 231.659
but this morning yeah I feel like I got

228.239 --> 234.299
that bad weed out of my system

231.659 --> 235.5
I have been smoking some other type of

234.299 --> 237.42000000000002
weed

235.5 --> 240.78
much lighter

237.42 --> 243.05999999999997
no freaky hybrids and just this morning

240.78 --> 246.599
I feel great

243.06 --> 249.239
I feel like I'm back to normal again

246.599 --> 251.39999999999998
it really was that cannabis it really

249.239 --> 254.0
was it

251.4 --> 254.0
ugh

254.159 --> 258.71999999999997
right also this morning I tried that new

257.28 --> 262.88
supplement

258.72 --> 262.88000000000005
for the first time the ashwagandha

263.22 --> 266.78000000000003
that I got for Christmas

267.9 --> 272.34
and I didn't know exactly what it was

270.06 --> 274.56
going to do but

272.34 --> 276.23999999999995
it feels pretty good and then again the

274.56 --> 278.16
weather was already pretty good and I

276.24 --> 280.38
did feel already pretty good even before

278.16 --> 283.62
I was taking it

280.38 --> 285.71999999999997
so I'm not sure but I think it it can do

283.62 --> 287.58
no harm at least

285.72 --> 291.32000000000005
and just seeing what my day is going to

287.58 --> 291.32
be like after having taken this

299.94 --> 303.479
let's see yesterday

305.12 --> 312.0
foreign wasn't a lot of things going

308.759 --> 315.38
around but flat soy did have a like it

312.0 --> 315.38
was pretty interesting Hangout

315.72 --> 320.94000000000005
about the Mandela effect

318.66 --> 323.639
apparently Michael Khan is all into that

320.94 --> 327.3
so he had been referencing some of those

323.639 --> 330.479
videos and just diving into it I was in

327.3 --> 333.919
chat there laying down my my insights on

330.479 --> 333.919
it how it's psychological again

337.56 --> 344.539
but yeah that was a pretty fun hangout

340.46 --> 344.539
flat so I took all the wrenches

345.66 --> 351.3
I guess that oh he wouldn't want to take

348.78 --> 355.08
one wrench away so he took them all

351.3 --> 357.12
because flat side's really in love with

355.08 --> 360.96
that girl

357.12 --> 363.0
he doesn't care yeah sure you don't

360.96 --> 365.34
but uh

363.0 --> 367.56
anyway it's all fine I didn't really

365.34 --> 371.23999999999995
need the wrench anyway I mean it's handy

367.56 --> 371.24
for if I want to post some kind of Link

371.28 --> 376.02
or if I want to moderate

373.86 --> 378.66
but I think that yeah PJ khrushchank

376.02 --> 380.639
still had his wrench and he's he does

378.66 --> 384.06
just fine

380.639 --> 386.28000000000003
anyway hello tiger bear first in chat

384.06 --> 389.6
good to see you

386.28 --> 389.59999999999997
how are you doing man

394.74 --> 401.419
I finished up on Benjamin stream from

397.319 --> 401.41900000000004
Saturday it was just really good

403.199 --> 410.41900000000004
it's like this exhilarated energy he had

406.699 --> 410.41900000000004
in the last few days

413.1 --> 418.56
foreign

415.22 --> 420.18
out there the whole alien [ __ ] is

418.56 --> 422.58
rolling out and it's clearly a

420.18 --> 425.16
distraction and even the the standard

422.58 --> 428.34
alternative Community media is figuring

425.16 --> 431.03900000000004
that out like oh yeah oh why now I mean

428.34 --> 433.919
this [ __ ] has been known for decades

431.039 --> 436.86
decades this has been happening and now

433.919 --> 440.0
they Declassified oh yes

436.86 --> 440.0
sure you are

440.28 --> 446.34
but I'm I guarantee it's not going to

443.819 --> 448.139
lead to anything it's just there to

446.34 --> 449.69899999999996
distract you and as soon as something

448.139 --> 453.139
else happens they'll put it back to the

449.699 --> 453.139
background like nothing happened

453.66 --> 457.259
really

455.22 --> 458.36
guarantee it our waiting guarantee

457.259 --> 460.62
because

458.36 --> 463.699
they don't know what to do with it they

460.62 --> 463.699
can't do anything with it

464.58 --> 470.18
and it's very likely even to be just

467.099 --> 470.18
human driven anyway

473.4 --> 477.599
whatever those things are that are

475.38 --> 479.52
getting shut down apparently there are

477.599 --> 481.38
things actually getting shut down and

479.52 --> 482.88
being described in detail and all that

481.38 --> 486.24
and there is

482.88 --> 489.3
even some footage out there

486.24 --> 492.86
so it might not have been a completely

489.3 --> 492.86
made up nonsense story

493.979 --> 499.919
but I mean it's definitely a distraction

496.88 --> 503.34
and dude there's been no like metal

499.919 --> 505.5
spheres and rods that fly by at

503.34 --> 506.87899999999996
incredible speeds can barely be even

505.5 --> 509.22
seen

506.879 --> 510.90000000000003
those things have been around since my

509.22 --> 514.14
teens

510.9 --> 517.68
My First Girlfriend it was really into

514.14 --> 520.88
aliens and UFOs like I that was when I

517.68 --> 520.88
was right 18.

520.979 --> 524.88
it was all there all that stuff

523.26 --> 528.18
photographs

524.88 --> 529.98
people with Witnesses of these types of

528.18 --> 532.38
the scenics types of things and there

529.98 --> 534.779
was even been people it was it gets even

532.38 --> 537.68
weirder and but this was way after like

534.779 --> 537.68
more in my 30s

537.779 --> 543.42
early very early 30s

540.36 --> 545.9590000000001
that a friend of mine that I was hanging

543.42 --> 548.9399999999999
around with a lot

545.959 --> 552.42
knew somebody that would actually like

548.94 --> 556.44
go in with little groups to the outdoor

552.42 --> 559.26
and then summon UFOs it's like

556.44 --> 560.399
what the [ __ ] is that I never was I was

559.26 --> 563.519
never there

560.399 --> 566.72
but that was a thing it's so weird man

563.519 --> 566.72
all of it

567.6 --> 574.32
felt kind of ominous like why

571.62 --> 576.48
why'd you do that like why would you do

574.32 --> 578.399
that what what do you even think it is

576.48 --> 581.04
and

578.399 --> 583.339
doesn't make any sense what do you think

581.04 --> 583.3389999999999
it is

583.8 --> 590.16
right and dude there's other groups too

588.0 --> 592.98
I mean

590.16 --> 595.38
this nine for News Channel Dutch news

592.98 --> 597.24
alternative stuff it's a gathering point

595.38 --> 600.6
of information

597.24 --> 603.48
but it's decent decent enough they are

600.6 --> 606.2
really into space too all of all that

603.48 --> 606.2
but

606.899 --> 612.36
before they started that Forum online

609.92 --> 614.6999999999999
they were doing stuff like having

612.36 --> 617.82
workshops and all that with free energy

614.7 --> 619.8000000000001
and I was there and these people like

617.82 --> 622.8000000000001
literally

619.8 --> 625.019
were like alien worship or some of them

622.8 --> 627.18
like worshipers they would literally

625.019 --> 631.2
summon them

627.18 --> 636.18
with pentagram circles

631.2 --> 640.5600000000001
oh yes oh those are aliens yes yes

636.18 --> 644.3389999999999
oh super safe I mean that's not [ __ ]

640.56 --> 646.14
up at all that you do that yes

644.339 --> 648.0600000000001
but uh

646.14 --> 649.3199999999999
I don't know if they still do that [ __ ]

648.06 --> 652.26
I don't know if it's all of them

649.32 --> 654.48
probably not but there's have been all

652.26 --> 657.8389999999999
kinds of weird [ __ ]

654.48 --> 659.94
with aliens and alien spirits and alien

657.839 --> 662.3000000000001
summoning is like oh yeah aliens I mean

659.94 --> 666.1800000000001
that's that doesn't

662.3 --> 668.3389999999999
resemble demon demons at all like that's

666.18 --> 670.56
not the things you do with demons some

668.339 --> 676.3800000000001
of them in Magic circles and I was like

670.56 --> 678.92
oh yes now it's aliens yes aliens yeah

676.38 --> 678.92
anyway

679.32 --> 685.1400000000001
so alien stuff

682.14 --> 688.079
has been around forever well not for

685.14 --> 690.48
it's been like really people been doing

688.079 --> 692.279
stuff with that as far as I know since

690.48 --> 694.0790000000001
the 90s pretty active and even before

692.279 --> 697.079
that it was known that there were like

694.079 --> 700.8199999999999
Cults that were into aliens and a whole

697.079 --> 700.8199999999999
bunch of Cults after the 70s

703.56 --> 707.899
anyway hello Crockett it's you

708.54 --> 714.24
but it's going around again and so

711.24 --> 717.54
people want to know about it well I can

714.24 --> 719.72
tell you some stuff about aliens if you

717.54 --> 719.7199999999999
want

722.88 --> 728.36
you blame Ancient Aliens

725.279 --> 728.36
from the History Channel

728.94 --> 732.48
well they just played Into The Fad I

731.82 --> 736.38
mean

732.48 --> 738.72
The X-Files really did started

736.38 --> 740.16
that may put it on the wider scale and

738.72 --> 744.9200000000001
there was even there were even like

740.16 --> 744.92
objections to it back then

745.5 --> 751.32
right

747.839 --> 754.0790000000001
like Christian objections

751.32 --> 756.12
now the Christians don't give a [ __ ]

754.079 --> 760.079
anymore everything goes now Christian

756.12 --> 762.36
has been liberated from Christ

760.079 --> 764.88
it's now do whatever the [ __ ] that I

762.36 --> 767.36
want just say the riddle and All Is

764.88 --> 767.36
Forgiven

767.459 --> 770.459
foreign

785.76 --> 789.079
so yeah that's happening

792.899 --> 798.42
I heard some disappointing news by the

795.0 --> 802.579
way that apparently uh Brazil has been

798.42 --> 802.579
sort of retaken by globalists

802.86 --> 809.24
so apparently uh

806.04 --> 809.24
forgot the guy's name

811.019 --> 813.68
I'm terrible

815.579 --> 819.959
terrible all the guys been very

817.74 --> 821.7
anti-globalist there

819.959 --> 823.68
if anybody can remind me of the name

821.7 --> 826.26
that would be great he's been present

823.68 --> 828.7199999999999
for a while very popular

826.26 --> 831.139
but yeah apparently he didn't make the

828.72 --> 834.24
elections this time so there's some

831.139 --> 836.639
grapply looking old guy and the first

834.24 --> 839.519
thing he does is oh

836.639 --> 842.94
we have a special poverty assistance

839.519 --> 844.98
program but you've got to take it a

842.94 --> 848.5790000000001
medical experiment

844.98 --> 851.519
in order to apply for it so it's just

848.579 --> 854.2199999999999
immediately back to the genocide agenda

851.519 --> 856.88
immediately so that is what it's all

854.22 --> 860.1
about the globalist agenda is about

856.88 --> 863.7
Exterminating Humanity that's what it is

860.1 --> 866.16
about that's the predominant primary

863.7 --> 869.5790000000001
goal

866.16 --> 871.98
get a globalist in immediately roll out

869.579 --> 873.8599999999999
Eugenics extermination program that's

871.98 --> 878.339
what they do

873.86 --> 882.0600000000001
so is there any reason why anybody would

878.339 --> 885.24
ever tolerate them under any condition

882.06 --> 888.5999999999999
taking over any condition including

885.24 --> 891.12
Siege or war or just blowing up

888.6 --> 893.5790000000001
everything I mean I don't think anything

891.12 --> 896.18
would be worth giving these people the

893.579 --> 896.18
reins ever

897.839 --> 903.4200000000001
one because once they got them you'll

899.88 --> 906.42
spend like 20 years trying to get them

903.42 --> 908.3389999999999
out and fail

906.42 --> 910.199
because that's the [ __ ] that the

908.339 --> 912.36
Netherlands is in I mean

910.199 --> 914.399
they got their claws and everything here

912.36 --> 917.519
and even though everybody knows that

914.399 --> 921.48
they're straight out satanic criminals

917.519 --> 924.5
that lie to your face double speak

921.48 --> 924.5
they're still there

924.66 --> 930.7199999999999
because they got their claws in

927.72 --> 934.32
everything in every Institute

930.72 --> 937.1990000000001
every government Institute and they're

934.32 --> 940.8000000000001
just breaking the system like

937.199 --> 943.079
we don't have to break the system they

940.8 --> 946.139
are breaking the system they are

943.079 --> 948.42
breaking the system of government yeah

946.139 --> 950.88
these globalists

948.42 --> 953.639
they are not the system they are

950.88 --> 955.8
breaking the system

953.639 --> 959.5790000000001
that is actually good

955.8 --> 962.279
because a system of government is good

959.579 --> 965.2199999999999
but when it's run by people that don't

962.279 --> 967.019
care about it about the system or the

965.22 --> 968.4590000000001
rules and that just want to do their own

967.019 --> 970.68
thing

968.459 --> 972.3599999999999
and corrupted well then they are

970.68 --> 974.54
destroying a system and that's what they

972.36 --> 974.54
do

975.06 --> 977.7199999999999
that's what they're doing

978.0 --> 982.98
Breaking All the laws

980.76 --> 985.199
bypassing everything

982.98 --> 988.8000000000001
well guess what the purpose of a

985.199 --> 992.12
government is not to bypass all the

988.8 --> 995.279
freaking laws for the government

992.12 --> 997.32
that's exactly the opposite of what

995.279 --> 1000.62
they're supposed to be doing

997.32 --> 1003.5
so they are breaking the system

1000.62 --> 1005.899
we don't have to break the system

1003.5 --> 1007.339
we have to restore the system they are

1005.899 --> 1011.199
the ones that are breaking the system

1007.339 --> 1011.1990000000001
they are the revolutionaries

1011.24 --> 1016.04
yeah

1013.459 --> 1019.2199999999999
and they're not going to be stopped

1016.04 --> 1022.16
because they have corrupted the system

1019.22 --> 1025.819
so badly that they just will not be

1022.16 --> 1028.339
stopped because the system there's some

1025.819 --> 1030.1399999999999
corruption in it the default is that

1028.339 --> 1032.72
something within the system is going to

1030.14 --> 1034.64
stop that but if everything is part of

1032.72 --> 1037.16
that corruption within that system then

1034.64 --> 1040.0
nothing is going to stop the corruption

1037.16 --> 1040.0
within the system

1040.339 --> 1045.9189999999999
except like a violent revolution

1043.459 --> 1049.3600000000001
that thing that I started talking about

1045.919 --> 1049.3600000000001
like four years ago

1054.38 --> 1059.48
it was built that we're not welcome no

1056.539 --> 1061.72
it was broken it was not built to be

1059.48 --> 1061.72
broken

1062.96 --> 1065.8600000000001
you're wrong

1066.86 --> 1071.84
it was built to not be broken

1069.62 --> 1074.7199999999998
but if you let globalists in then

1071.84 --> 1078.32
they're gonna literally crack and Warp

1074.72 --> 1082.22
and erase everything bypass through

1078.32 --> 1084.5
[ __ ] contemporary hyped ideas bypass

1082.22 --> 1086.9
everything that was actually the

1084.5 --> 1089.74
Safeguard to prevent further corruption

1086.9 --> 1093.2
that's what they do

1089.74 --> 1096.919
globalists only introduce laws to kill

1093.2 --> 1100.039
off the population and to prevent

1096.919 --> 1104.72
themselves from being unseated for their

1100.039 --> 1106.8799999999999
corruption that's all they ever do the

1104.72 --> 1109.059
only thing they ever do

1106.88 --> 1109.0590000000002
foreign

1112.1 --> 1117.52
so don't let them in because they'll

1114.5 --> 1117.52
destroy the system

1117.919 --> 1125.14
and they'll not come out and you all die

1121.64 --> 1125.14
and suffer for it

1125.66 --> 1129.22
and nothing will stop it

1131.9 --> 1136.7800000000002
all right anyway hello steam traveler

1133.94 --> 1136.78
good to see you

1138.799 --> 1143.3799999999999
well Jane's favorite videos

1150.14 --> 1156.46
their life I yeah I don't know exactly

1152.9 --> 1156.46
who their life is but

1157.58 --> 1161.48
but yeah globalists what I just

1159.679 --> 1164.24
described that is literally all they

1161.48 --> 1167.24
ever do that's how you recognize them oh

1164.24 --> 1168.799
nice face oh nice promises and then the

1167.24 --> 1171.26
first thing they do as soon as they get

1168.799 --> 1174.1399999999999
to control is literally

1171.26 --> 1176.78
ravage everything

1174.14 --> 1178.7
and introduce Eugenics extermination

1176.78 --> 1181.0
policies

1178.7 --> 1183.799
that's what they do now

1181.0 --> 1186.52
they have been doing it it's just really

1183.799 --> 1186.52
overt now

1186.62 --> 1193.58
like they don't care they don't care for

1189.679 --> 1195.6200000000001
that people know

1193.58 --> 1197.84
that the whole medical experimentation

1195.62 --> 1199.6999999999998
is just an extermination program they

1197.84 --> 1200.4189999999999
don't care they're just gonna do it

1199.7 --> 1202.82
anyway

1200.419 --> 1205.4
it's like no oh

1202.82 --> 1208.1599999999999
yeah oh you you can get a little feed

1205.4 --> 1210.44
but you have to die

1208.16 --> 1214.3400000000001
yeah you have to literally do Russian

1210.44 --> 1216.3200000000002
Roulette to get your rations

1214.34 --> 1219.799
that that's what they're pushing you

1216.32 --> 1222.559
have to do Russian Roulette

1219.799 --> 1225.799
just to be able to survive that's where

1222.559 --> 1228.08
they want it because they just want you

1225.799 --> 1229.7
to die

1228.08 --> 1233.26
and that is all

1229.7 --> 1238.9
they don't care for anything else

1233.26 --> 1238.9
they just want you to die

1245.44 --> 1254.48
right and I really think it's time to

1251.14 --> 1257.2
return the favor

1254.48 --> 1257.2
huh

1260.0 --> 1263.08
it's taking so long

1273.039 --> 1278.26
how many deaths do they want all of them

1279.14 --> 1284.48
and then if there's any Human Service

1281.24 --> 1286.64
that will survive besides themselves if

1284.48 --> 1287.66
you can even call them humans by that

1286.64 --> 1290.539
time

1287.66 --> 1291.7
then they will literally destroy life

1290.539 --> 1295.28
itself

1291.7 --> 1297.38
just to prevent those people that have

1295.28 --> 1299.1789999999999
been completely weaning off the system

1297.38 --> 1302.48
for a very long time that are completely

1299.179 --> 1305.96
safe just for them to not be able to

1302.48 --> 1310.82
survive in the wild they'll destroy all

1305.96 --> 1314.2
life just to do that because there is no

1310.82 --> 1314.2
getting away

1314.679 --> 1321.26
under any condition

1317.9 --> 1326.679
there is no getting away the only

1321.26 --> 1326.679
solution is for them to die

1329.12 --> 1332.5
so yeah

1340.7 --> 1345.26
because if you think Oh They'll be put

1343.4 --> 1345.919
out of their function oh they finally

1345.26 --> 1348.32
got

1345.919 --> 1349.64
arrested him oh yeah oh yes

1348.32 --> 1351.86
they've been relieved from their

1349.64 --> 1353.9
function oh now it's all good yeah and

1351.86 --> 1356.6
guess what they're just gonna

1353.9 --> 1359.3600000000001
sit in some mansion that's supposed to

1356.6 --> 1363.8799999999999
be a prison under house arrest

1359.36 --> 1368.0
for some time and they'll just continue

1363.88 --> 1370.5800000000002
organizing the their globalist

1368.0 --> 1373.28
government from that supposed prison

1370.58 --> 1376.28
that's what they will do that's why they

1373.28 --> 1377.78
have to die

1376.28 --> 1382.6399999999999
die

1377.78 --> 1387.08
they must die you cannot leave the

1382.64 --> 1390.7990000000002
globalists alive because they will just

1387.08 --> 1393.86
continue doing what they ever will

1390.799 --> 1397.1589999999999
you put them all in prison then from the

1393.86 --> 1399.799
[ __ ] prison they will just get

1397.159 --> 1403.22
mercenaries on the outside and just

1399.799 --> 1406.1589999999999
continue because they don't care

1403.22 --> 1409.179
they are not going to be stopped except

1406.159 --> 1409.179
through death

1409.7 --> 1416.299
they must all die

1412.7 --> 1419.02
there is no other way out of this

1416.299 --> 1419.02
none

1423.38 --> 1430.64
there needs to be a Nazi hunt

1427.82 --> 1433.3999999999999
supposed Nazi on if that like even if

1430.64 --> 1436.88
that is as it was portrayed like after

1433.4 --> 1441.6200000000001
World War II right a Nazi hunt it needs

1436.88 --> 1444.38
to be happen happening on globalists

1441.62 --> 1448.1589999999999
they need to be hunted

1444.38 --> 1451.3600000000001
and killed every single conspirator in

1448.159 --> 1451.3600000000001
this entire mechanism

1459.74 --> 1464.78
why Kill Everybody

1461.9 --> 1467.299
you don't have to kill everybody

1464.78 --> 1471.62
they want to kill everybody

1467.299 --> 1474.8799999999999
the globalist eugenicist satanic Nazis

1471.62 --> 1477.7399999999998
want to kill everybody and they are

1474.88 --> 1481.64
doesn't have to be a motivation they are

1477.74 --> 1483.2
satanically insane they are 100 gripped

1481.64 --> 1486.159
by the devil and they can't get out

1483.2 --> 1486.159
until they die

1486.799 --> 1492.44
they will continue they are witches

1489.14 --> 1494.7800000000002
bound to hell they cannot stop they

1492.44 --> 1497.919
cannot stop they will not stop until

1494.78 --> 1497.9189999999999
they are dead

1498.2 --> 1503.539
foreign

1500.179 --> 1506.24
they're hell-bound they can't stop

1503.539 --> 1509.6589999999999
they don't have control over themselves

1506.24 --> 1512.6
they're part of this mechanism this

1509.659 --> 1514.8200000000002
satanic mechanism they cannot stop

1512.6 --> 1517.82
they can't

1514.82 --> 1519.2
they can't even choose to they have to

1517.82 --> 1521.36
do that

1519.2 --> 1524.0800000000002
there's nothing else they can do they

1521.36 --> 1524.08
have to do it

1525.679 --> 1530.799
and the only way to stop it is for them

1528.26 --> 1530.799
to die

1530.96 --> 1533.8600000000001
that's okay

1536.02 --> 1540.1589999999999
hello Gideon's Sick by the way

1542.36 --> 1546.4399999999998
you have to kill everybody there will be

1544.58 --> 1547.82
nobody to govern yeah they don't want to

1546.44 --> 1550.76
govern

1547.82 --> 1553.22
they don't want to govern true levels

1550.76 --> 1556.82
they don't give a [ __ ] about governing

1553.22 --> 1559.82
they just want all the power

1556.82 --> 1562.039
and then having everything killing

1559.82 --> 1563.48
everybody else so they can just have

1562.039 --> 1566.779
everything

1563.48 --> 1568.96
and sit on their Treasures until they

1566.779 --> 1568.96
die

1569.299 --> 1574.1589999999999
that's all that's the only thing that

1572.059 --> 1576.9189999999999
they're gonna do because they don't care

1574.159 --> 1579.2
to govern they only want government so

1576.919 --> 1582.44
they can take power and kill everyone

1579.2 --> 1585.52
they don't care to govern anybody they

1582.44 --> 1585.52
just want to kill everybody

1588.61 --> 1591.6999999999998
[Music]

1592.1 --> 1597.9189999999999
is govern not power

1594.86 --> 1601.1589999999999
no not necessarily it's a responsibility

1597.919 --> 1603.2
that comes with some power

1601.159 --> 1606.0200000000002
right they just want the power they

1603.2 --> 1608.919
don't want to govern governing is just a

1606.02 --> 1611.48
means to an end for them

1608.919 --> 1613.76
yup take whatever Institute they can

1611.48 --> 1617.14
wherever the power is they'll get in

1613.76 --> 1617.14
there and they'll take it

1626.48 --> 1631.279
foreign

1628.539 --> 1633.32
as long as there's people alive in a

1631.279 --> 1635.419
country then they will have a motivation

1633.32 --> 1637.1589999999999
to take over that government so they can

1635.419 --> 1638.5590000000002
kill those people

1637.159 --> 1643.0390000000002
or

1638.559 --> 1648.1
put them up to kill some other people

1643.039 --> 1648.1
as long as people die it's okay didn't

1650.36 --> 1655.6399999999999
pointless the girl yeah but who says

1652.64 --> 1659.0590000000002
there's a logical human point to what

1655.64 --> 1661.5800000000002
they do linear View

1659.059 --> 1664.76
they are satanically bound they're like

1661.58 --> 1668.1399999999999
witches Hellbound they cannot stop and

1664.76 --> 1668.14
they just have to kill everybody

1668.299 --> 1675.26
I mean if you can't see that then you

1671.72 --> 1676.58
don't have senses to see

1675.26 --> 1679.64
who are they

1676.58 --> 1682.34
how many thousands

1679.64 --> 1685.22
thousands and thousands of people maybe

1682.34 --> 1689.799
like a hundred thousand or something

1685.22 --> 1689.799
that are part of this globalist network

1690.22 --> 1693.88
anti-human conspirators

1695.12 --> 1700.059
and the names are very familiar

1700.94 --> 1705.2
so it's all of the like the Rockefeller

1703.34 --> 1707.4189999999999
Rothschilds

1705.2 --> 1711.0800000000002
the Schwabs

1707.419 --> 1713.179
dude there's so many oh it's basically

1711.08 --> 1716.24
one giant family

1713.179 --> 1721.24
with agents agencies

1716.24 --> 1721.24
so that's it that's what they are

1721.7 --> 1727.1000000000001
Now put on any skin

1724.039 --> 1730.039
that is convenient to them as long as

1727.1 --> 1732.5
they can attain power mind control and

1730.039 --> 1734.779
then get a lot of people killed that's

1732.5 --> 1736.7
what they do every single time it's all

1734.779 --> 1739.1
they ever do

1736.7 --> 1743.6200000000001
get power

1739.1 --> 1743.62
twist everything and then kill everybody

1748.159 --> 1753.5800000000002
by any means necessary

1750.98 --> 1753.58
foreign

1779.96 --> 1785.2
six million Survivor what what are you

1782.84 --> 1785.1999999999998
talking about

1786.2 --> 1788.74
foreign

1814.58 --> 1818.48
what should we do with the children of

1816.919 --> 1820.7
the globalists

1818.48 --> 1823.82
well it depends on what they do they

1820.7 --> 1825.74
should be put on a permanent marked list

1823.82 --> 1830.1789999999999
all of them

1825.74 --> 1833.36
and if they ever even get involved as to

1830.179 --> 1835.5800000000002
a hint of these types of activities then

1833.36 --> 1838.039
they should immediately brutally be

1835.58 --> 1840.26
punished

1838.039 --> 1842.98
and that they should have that Mark the

1840.26 --> 1842.98
rest of their life

1852.799 --> 1857.779
and that includes [ __ ] nobility that

1855.919 --> 1860.44
are part of it they too should have

1857.779 --> 1860.44
marks

1866.659 --> 1872.7990000000002
how do we know this

1869.779 --> 1872.799
what are you talking about

1874.399 --> 1881.32
I mean who will care for the children

1878.24 --> 1881.32
what are you talking about

1885.5 --> 1889.039
those children are pretty much all

1887.659 --> 1891.2
adults

1889.039 --> 1893.36
what do you think that any globalist

1891.2 --> 1895.659
currently being part of this have young

1893.36 --> 1895.6589999999999
children

1899.0 --> 1902.72
or if they have any young children it's

1900.919 --> 1904.88
very likely that they're all just turned

1902.72 --> 1907.82
trans anyway

1904.88 --> 1910.22
they're gonna be mutilated at a very

1907.82 --> 1912.8799999999999
young age so it's like what the [ __ ] is

1910.22 --> 1912.88
the point of this

1915.559 --> 1919.12
where do I get this information

1919.52 --> 1922.539
it's from over there

1922.82 --> 1925.82
foreign

1940.72 --> 1945.679
but anyway your guys are all still

1943.94 --> 1948.14
thinking like oh we're going to do

1945.679 --> 1950.96
something about it then no what the [ __ ]

1948.14 --> 1953.539
says that you even can

1950.96 --> 1955.1000000000001
yeah I'm not laying down an action plan

1953.539 --> 1957.98
okay

1955.1 --> 1960.98
I don't have an answer as to how to

1957.98 --> 1962.659
accomplish them all dying because from

1960.98 --> 1964.34
the Grassroots it's certainly not going

1962.659 --> 1966.8600000000001
to work people are so [ __ ]

1964.34 --> 1969.74
conditioned to be absolute permanent

1966.86 --> 1972.74
slaves they'd rather kill themselves

1969.74 --> 1975.559
than [ __ ] do it to somebody else even

1972.74 --> 1981.039
though they deserve it like nothing else

1975.559 --> 1981.039
before right people don't do it anymore

1981.14 --> 1986.6000000000001
we don't we've lost the will

1984.86 --> 1989.059
to kill

1986.6 --> 1992.899
to survive

1989.059 --> 1994.58
in the west totally

1992.899 --> 1997.9599999999998
will you enter please you got your

1994.58 --> 1997.96
answer why'd you go [ __ ] yourself

1998.299 --> 2003.519

2000.7 --> 2005.2
what you think I need to cite it

2003.519 --> 2007.299
what the [ __ ] are you blabbering about

2005.2 --> 2011.6200000000001

I get it from in here

2023.919 --> 2030.1000000000001
from my spirit from My overall knowledge

2026.62 --> 2032.58
I can't point at a source

2061.72 --> 2066.1789999999996

2108.22 --> 2114.0989999999997
could flag it and then oh where you see

2148.18 --> 2154.24
saying it as I see it based on very wide

2151.9 --> 2156.1600000000003
experience including freaking dark world

2154.24 --> 2158.56
yeah

2156.16 --> 2161.94
because I hung around with these

2158.56 --> 2166.42
scumbags I thought I was one of them

2161.94 --> 2169.0
yeah 20 years ago I thought I was one of

2166.42 --> 2172.359
them I [ __ ] know how they work

2169.0 --> 2174.22
through the other dimension

2172.359 --> 2177.04
yeah

2174.22 --> 2180.339
I don't have [ __ ] citations for my

2177.04 --> 2180.339
vision yeah

2188.92 --> 2191.92
foreign

2197.76 --> 2204.579
Bible thanks I have a demon oh you can

2201.46 --> 2208.66
get the [ __ ] out of here huh

2204.579 --> 2211.92
bye [ __ ] just arriving immediately

2208.66 --> 2211.92
throwing out [ __ ]

2212.82 --> 2217.1800000000003
obviously never actually watched my

2215.44 --> 2219.28
channel so he doesn't even understand

2217.18 --> 2222.24
what the [ __ ] I'm talking about and how

2219.28 --> 2224.92
I talk about things huh

2222.24 --> 2227.3799999999997
yeah I don't need to read the King James

2224.92 --> 2231.339
Bible I don't need your [ __ ] Bible yeah

2227.38 --> 2235.92
written by a freaking [ __ ]

2231.339 --> 2235.92
a Blasphemous [ __ ] yeah thanks

2238.18 --> 2243.8199999999997
you want to believe that [ __ ] it's your

2240.7 --> 2246.5789999999997
problem I know about demons I talk about

2243.82 --> 2248.619
demons I talk about what demons are from

2246.579 --> 2251.44
different perspective the internal

2248.619 --> 2253.839
psychology demons the challenge of God

2251.44 --> 2257.14
and the extra dimensional entities

2253.839 --> 2260.0789999999997
demons yeah I've been through all of

2257.14 --> 2262.54
that more than any person I've ever met

2260.079 --> 2264.2200000000003
accept people that are just completely

2262.54 --> 2267.96
captured by them

2264.22 --> 2267.9599999999996
because that's what usually happens

2268.06 --> 2272.099
yeah I know about demons yeah

2273.88 --> 2279.6400000000003
my demon is that I [ __ ] know this

2277.119 --> 2281.44
[ __ ] I know [ __ ] that I don't even want

2279.64 --> 2284.44
to know

2281.44 --> 2287.2000000000003
a lot I don't want to know

2284.44 --> 2290.079
and I try to keep it as much buried as I

2287.2 --> 2292.54
am because it literally makes me want to

2290.079 --> 2296.2000000000003
kill myself just [ __ ] knowing that

2292.54 --> 2299.2
that [ __ ] exists okay

2296.2 --> 2299.2
foreign

2307.5 --> 2315.28
murderous horrific depression

2311.8 --> 2318.3390000000004
so bad that I literally made myself

2315.28 --> 2320.76
forget everything yeah that's how well I

2318.339 --> 2320.7599999999998
took it

2325.72 --> 2327.7799999999997
oh

2328.72 --> 2331.3199999999997
foreign

2334.66 --> 2340.0
just jumped on my honest open occult

2338.079 --> 2341.92
ability it's not even a cold really it's

2340.0 --> 2344.079
more it's just magic it's just the

2341.92 --> 2347.2000000000003
spirit magic I had it I was so strong

2344.079 --> 2351.88
with my teens and so good and hopeful

2347.2 --> 2354.52
and they literally approached me Lord me

2351.88 --> 2356.859
I didn't bite but they wouldn't let go

2354.52 --> 2359.56
they wouldn't let me go

2356.859 --> 2361.24
they basically said like they said to me

2359.56 --> 2364.359
We're Not Gonna Let You Go there's

2361.24 --> 2368.3799999999997
nowhere you can run okay I got to hear

2364.359 --> 2370.359
that when I was a [ __ ] teenager yeah

2368.38 --> 2372.52
and when I went to the [ __ ] police

2370.359 --> 2374.2
with that [ __ ] they said they couldn't

2372.52 --> 2376.9
help me

2374.2 --> 2382.0789999999997
yeah you know what the [ __ ] that does to

2376.9 --> 2382.079
you it ruins your entire [ __ ] life

2388.32 --> 2393.52
yeah I didn't have the shield of Jesus

2391.18 --> 2396.46
Christ back then

2393.52 --> 2399.099
only thing that shielded me was just God

2396.46 --> 2401.26
and knowing god and yeah it could invoke

2399.099 --> 2402.339
Jesus Christ and they have a couple of

2401.26 --> 2404.8
times

2402.339 --> 2406.48
it's not Jesus Christ that saved me

2404.8 --> 2409.0
through that

2406.48 --> 2413.02
I don't think anything actually saved me

2409.0 --> 2414.22
through that it just tore me apart

2413.02 --> 2417.16
yeah

2414.22 --> 2419.9199999999996
there's no sucker in believing in

2417.16 --> 2422.92
[ __ ] Jesus after the [ __ ] that I saw

2419.92 --> 2422.92
yeah

2425.8 --> 2428.8
foreign

2429.28 --> 2432.28
triggered

2433.119 --> 2439.2400000000002
because it [ __ ] hurts it's up close

2436.72 --> 2441.0989999999997
it's up close right here

2439.24 --> 2443.4599999999996
or my roommate's home I don't know if

2441.099 --> 2443.46
they are

2443.74 --> 2448.4199999999996
I don't care

2446.339 --> 2450.88
I think

2448.42 --> 2452.8
the girl might be there I don't think

2450.88 --> 2454.48
she really minds too much I mean they're

2452.8 --> 2456.82
gonna knock on my door if it's gonna be

2454.48 --> 2458.859
too much I've not even been that [ __ ]

2456.82 --> 2461.46
loud so

2458.859 --> 2461.46
foreign

2465.94 --> 2470.68
but I'm actually feeling good it's weird

2468.82 --> 2472.48
enough that I feel good enough to even

2470.68 --> 2475.06
let this out because I don't feel like

2472.48 --> 2478.2400000000002
I'm not ruined yeah if I had brought

2475.06 --> 2481.48
this up like say four days ago I would

2478.24 --> 2484.24
have literally burst out crying because

2481.48 --> 2486.76
of the [ __ ] pain but today I feel so

2484.24 --> 2490.24
strong that I can actually bring it up

2486.76 --> 2492.5200000000004
and not completely crumble

2490.24 --> 2495.4599999999996
that's the difference

2492.52 --> 2498.28
what it does upset me yeah I will never

2495.46 --> 2500.079
talk about this kind of [ __ ] that it

2498.28 --> 2502.3590000000004
wouldn't upset me

2500.079 --> 2504.76
because it does and it is extremely

2502.359 --> 2508.7799999999997
upsetting the [ __ ] that I've seen is

2504.76 --> 2512.079
intolerable yeah it was so intolerable

2508.78 --> 2515.5600000000004
that it made me feel please somebody

2512.079 --> 2519.04
send a hydrogen bomb to this [ __ ]

2515.56 --> 2522.22
country yeah it's that bad

2519.04 --> 2526.06
I just wanted everything to be destroyed

2522.22 --> 2528.66
it was that [ __ ] bad

2526.06 --> 2528.66
foreign

2533.93 --> 2538.2999999999997
[Music]

2535.44 --> 2542.2000000000003
or worse

2538.3 --> 2546.82
and have to sit on that and [ __ ] find

2542.2 --> 2550.1189999999997
out a way to live yeah to actually try

2546.82 --> 2553.78
to forget that's out there and then oh

2550.119 --> 2557.6800000000003
just integrate in society oh yes oh

2553.78 --> 2560.7400000000002
that's so great that's so much fun

2557.68 --> 2562.839
so great knowing that there's literal

2560.74 --> 2566.5
monsters out there and people can't even

2562.839 --> 2571.68
handle hearing about it including myself

2566.5 --> 2571.68
yeah right I heard about it yeah

2574.98 --> 2580.38
and I saw [ __ ] that I wish I'd never

2578.02 --> 2580.38
seen

2586.0 --> 2594.78
[ __ ] that I will never ever describe

2590.98 --> 2594.78
publicly never ever

2604.54 --> 2611.68
and why why wouldn't I do that because

2607.3 --> 2614.7400000000002
I'm so [ __ ] ashamed of myself

2611.68 --> 2617.8799999999997
that I couldn't do anything about it

2614.74 --> 2617.8799999999997
that's why

2625.0 --> 2630.839
back technically I still can't do

2628.0 --> 2630.839
anything about it

2632.8 --> 2636.3590000000004
just know how it works now

2638.2 --> 2641.3799999999997
yeah

2639.599 --> 2645.579
I mean

2641.38 --> 2648.099
it's really great when you're 17 and

2645.579 --> 2651.099
that's not fair I got to hear of it when

2648.099 --> 2653.5
I was 17 but I got to see [ __ ] and it's

2651.099 --> 2656.26
like oh yeah yeah yeah of course

2653.5 --> 2659.7
I I can't even I can't even Hint it I

2656.26 --> 2659.7000000000003
can't do it I can't

2671.92 --> 2677.28
I mean I'll talk to a therapist about it

2674.38 --> 2677.28
perhaps but

2683.319 --> 2686.2799999999997
that's about it

2687.099 --> 2691.56
and they'll do nothing with it that's

2689.2 --> 2691.56
for sure

2691.72 --> 2697.48
I mean I've tried to explain some of

2693.76 --> 2699.61
these things to people before and they

2697.48 --> 2701.319
would literally just like stop

2699.61 --> 2703.42
[Music]

2701.319 --> 2705.88
okay

2703.42 --> 2709.0
yeah when a therapist just says stop

2705.88 --> 2711.28
yeah that's when you know you're in so

2709.0 --> 2713.92
much [ __ ] that you just can't get out of

2711.28 --> 2717.3
it because there's nobody that can help

2713.92 --> 2717.3
you resolve that ever

2718.319 --> 2722.859
foreign

2720.48 --> 2726.64
so I bury it

2722.859 --> 2729.0989999999997
a lot I've been burying a lot for a long

2726.64 --> 2731.14
time and then I forget and then I get

2729.099 --> 2732.579
reminded and the nightmare pops back

2731.14 --> 2734.6189999999997
open again

2732.579 --> 2736.96
then I have to forget again yeah yeah

2734.619 --> 2740.339
it's called [ __ ] trauma and I've been

2736.96 --> 2740.339
dealing it for half my life

2742.119 --> 2746.92
and I still get [ __ ] flashbacks

2744.7 --> 2749.4399999999996
regularly

2746.92 --> 2752.2000000000003
and now it doesn't hurt as much when I

2749.44 --> 2756.4
get a flashback because I literally just

2752.2 --> 2759.2999999999997
turn off my feelings which I can now

2756.4 --> 2759.3
mostly

2762.22 --> 2765.819
when was the lag time I spoke with a

2764.26 --> 2768.4
therapist

2765.819 --> 2770.079
well it depends on really what your

2768.4 --> 2771.579
classifies therapist I mean social

2770.079 --> 2774.4
worker

2771.579 --> 2776.2000000000003
when did I last talk to them I the last

2774.4 --> 2778.119
year

2776.2 --> 2780.7599999999998
I don't really talk a lot to them now

2778.119 --> 2782.859
because I'm much more stable now I mean

2780.76 --> 2785.0400000000004
when I first came to move here I was a

2782.859 --> 2785.04
wreck

2785.26 --> 2789.579
like

2786.76 --> 2792.5200000000004
such a wreck that I would compulsively

2789.579 --> 2795.4
call up people just to distract me from

2792.52 --> 2798.7599999999998
my own misery and panic

2795.4 --> 2801.96
on a daily basis multiple times a day

2798.76 --> 2801.96
for like years

2805.359 --> 2810.9
no I wasn't continually like that but a

2808.359 --> 2814.359
lot so it was bad and I'm doing

2810.9 --> 2816.88
incredibly much better now but I mean My

2814.359 --> 2820.319
overall condition is much better I eat

2816.88 --> 2820.319
much healthier

2820.54 --> 2825.16
come on

2822.099 --> 2826.3
even then when I I was already eating

2825.16 --> 2829.96
organic

2826.3 --> 2832.1800000000003
but now even within the organic food my

2829.96 --> 2833.619
picks are much better much more well

2832.18 --> 2836.8799999999997
considered

2833.619 --> 2836.88
much more balanced

2843.46 --> 2846.54
[ __ ] scumbag

2848.8 --> 2857.819
yeah it wasn't chasing demons dude

2852.64 --> 2857.819
the people living people

2865.0 --> 2869.26
you consider the letter of the early

2866.859 --> 2871.74
bird a form of therapy for me well yeah

2869.26 --> 2871.7400000000002
also

2871.839 --> 2874.619
in a way

2884.079 --> 2892.079
I mean what is therapy therapy is most

2887.56 --> 2892.0789999999997
of it is just sharing your story

2893.14 --> 2897.94
right and then people seek out therapy

2895.839 --> 2900.22
because they're so ashamed or they have

2897.94 --> 2902.44
an image to uphold and they can't show

2900.22 --> 2905.2599999999998
that side of them so they go to a

2902.44 --> 2908.02
therapist and then they secretly

2905.26 --> 2913.38
try to resolve that yeah

2908.02 --> 2913.38
well I don't need secrecy for that

2915.22 --> 2922.4199999999996
except when yeah when things get just

2918.16 --> 2924.64
too risky or whatever

2922.42 --> 2927.52
I don't want to open certain cans

2924.64 --> 2929.0789999999997
because then those cans will just be

2927.52 --> 2931.119
open and they won't be able to do

2929.079 --> 2933.6400000000003
anything with it I mean as soon as I can

2931.119 --> 2936.339
figure out how to actually

2933.64 --> 2940.3799999999997
resolve the whole thing that's when I

2936.339 --> 2940.38
might actually just start opening up

2940.599 --> 2945.46
but I'm not in that position I mean in

2943.66 --> 2947.2599999999998
my imagination at least I don't even

2945.46 --> 2950.44
know if anybody even keeps track or

2947.26 --> 2952.0
anything from those people

2950.44 --> 2954.3
they might not even be in a country

2952.0 --> 2954.3
anymore

2954.46 --> 2958.96
right

2956.14 --> 2960.7599999999998
but I am not in a position where oh just

2958.96 --> 2963.48
I'll just open it up yeah guess what's

2960.76 --> 2963.48
going to happen then

2964.0 --> 2970.24
they will come after me

2966.28 --> 2972.1600000000003
it's the thing that I feared so much

2970.24 --> 2974.2
even at the start because I thought it

2972.16 --> 2978.52
was also tied into Flat Earth but that

2974.2 --> 2981.52
was incorrect that was another element

2978.52 --> 2981.52
separated

2982.839 --> 2988.0
but at first I was scared that those

2985.0 --> 2990.22
people would come after me for doing

2988.0 --> 2993.76
Flat Earth openly I literally thought

2990.22 --> 2996.24
that I had been threatened by people of

2993.76 --> 2996.2400000000002
that Circle

3005.52 --> 3008.52
foreign

3014.42 --> 3017.54
ature boy

3018.359 --> 3022.14
right

3019.68 --> 3024.06
might have something to do with movie

3022.14 --> 3027.0
that I watched yesterday

3024.06 --> 3029.5789999999997
they really rekindled that terrible

3027.0 --> 3033.2
terrible flame again

3029.579 --> 3033.2000000000003
movie called sleepers

3033.72 --> 3039.0789999999997
it's Dreadful in ways but still very

3036.599 --> 3039.079
interesting

3043.079 --> 3049.6400000000003
and it definitely reminded me of some of

3046.619 --> 3049.6400000000003
the things that I'd seen

3074.76 --> 3077.5400000000004
foreign

3081.66 --> 3087.96
anyway let's get back on track here I

3086.099 --> 3089.4
mean I don't want this entire show to

3087.96 --> 3091.619
just be that

3089.4 --> 3093.8
or maybe it is I don't know it's so it's

3091.619 --> 3096.6600000000003
it's out there now so

3093.8 --> 3099.9
seeing some [ __ ]

3096.66 --> 3102.98
in my past and today I felt like talking

3099.9 --> 3102.98
about it apparently

3107.64 --> 3110.54
foreign

3158.7 --> 3163.98
foreign

3161.4 --> 3165.9
it's weird by the way because I still

3163.98 --> 3167.579
feel good

3165.9 --> 3169.8
I still feel strong maybe it's the

3167.579 --> 3171.9
ashwagandha that's doing that

3169.8 --> 3174.059
normally if I break an oak this open

3171.9 --> 3176.46
this can I feel really miserable

3174.059 --> 3179.28
immediately

3176.46 --> 3182.52
no I feel like I can just handle it

3179.28 --> 3182.52
better weird

3205.38 --> 3212.099
all right then hey with some of you guys

3208.14 --> 3214.44
dude I will even discuss some of the

3212.099 --> 3216.599
details privately if you really want to

3214.44 --> 3218.46
know but

3216.599 --> 3221.059
it's not going to make you any happier

3218.46 --> 3221.059
trust me

3223.079 --> 3227.46
I don't say it because they're just even

3225.359 --> 3229.2
talking about it to me is like speaking

3227.46 --> 3231.54
the language of Mordor it's that

3229.2 --> 3234.359
horrific

3231.54 --> 3237.8
you just don't do that you invoke Demons

3234.359 --> 3237.7999999999997
by just talking about it

3251.52 --> 3258.24
right but in a way let's just say that

3255.54 --> 3263.599
when that all happened

3258.24 --> 3263.5989999999997
I truly lost my faith in humanity

3263.64 --> 3268.6189999999997
now knowing that these things were

3265.74 --> 3271.9799999999996
actually happening and possible and what

3268.619 --> 3274.5
people were capable of doing

3271.98 --> 3276.18
from many different angles is not just

3274.5 --> 3279.3
oh the

3276.18 --> 3281.819
the brutal psychopath murderer torture

3279.3 --> 3285.44
or whatever no it's not just that it's

3281.819 --> 3285.44
worse it's worse

3287.0 --> 3293.28
it's it's so psychological it was it was

3290.52 --> 3295.14
hell it was literal hell what I saw and

3293.28 --> 3298.1400000000003
what I heard it's

3295.14 --> 3301.02
and not even like oh gory spectacle no

3298.14 --> 3303.5989999999997
the psychology of it was so ultimately

3301.02 --> 3305.339
[ __ ] that I just

3303.599 --> 3307.319
couldn't

3305.339 --> 3309.7799999999997
I couldn't even

3307.319 --> 3314.0
have it in my head

3309.78 --> 3314.0
I just had to forget all of it

3325.14 --> 3334.14
I mean the reality is a lot worse than

3328.2 --> 3334.14
what you see in movies a lot worse like

3334.5 --> 3337.7
you cannot

3337.92 --> 3343.079
as an actor Express those things that

3341.04 --> 3345.359
I've witnessed in order to accurately

3343.079 --> 3348.48
portray what I witnessed in a movie like

3345.359 --> 3351.5
that's you can't do that

3348.48 --> 3351.5
it wouldn't work

3354.96 --> 3359.88
because every movie is always going to

3356.94 --> 3361.5
be guided by emotional guidance and

3359.88 --> 3364.6800000000003
storyline

3361.5 --> 3367.76
and this you can't do that with this it

3364.68 --> 3367.7599999999998
was just pure hell

3367.8 --> 3375.079
it was Satan's perspective

3371.28 --> 3375.079
as pure as I've ever seen it

3386.76 --> 3392.78
anyways I think it's actually a miracle

3388.92 --> 3392.78
that I even still alive right now

3395.16 --> 3399.2599999999998
that they just let me go

3399.319 --> 3404.099
eventually I guess that because I was

3402.3 --> 3406.559
just so broken

3404.099 --> 3408.54
that they thought like oh yeah we just

3406.559 --> 3410.8190000000004
broke him it's it's safe now he's not

3408.54 --> 3413.4
gonna do anything noteworthy anymore

3410.819 --> 3416.42
he's never gonna come after us

3413.4 --> 3416.42
because we broke him

3437.76 --> 3442.8
and I've been looking for a way to

3440.04 --> 3445.8
Unbreak ever since

3442.8 --> 3445.8
foreign

3447.78 --> 3455.28
that I can't imagine that happening

3450.66 --> 3460.04
is if all globalists die

3455.28 --> 3460.0400000000004
die all of you die

3460.079 --> 3463.52
for painful the better

3463.8 --> 3469.04
because that's exactly what was behind

3466.02 --> 3469.04
what I witnessed

3475.8 --> 3477.98
foreign

3484.04 --> 3490.02
dude are you nuts

3487.5 --> 3492.319
I'm never even getting close to those

3490.02 --> 3492.319
people

3493.02 --> 3498.319
they got badges

3495.18 --> 3498.319
out of their ass

3498.839 --> 3503.94
Secret Service [ __ ]

3501.3 --> 3505.8590000000004
there's nothing I could ever do

3503.94 --> 3507.96
ever

3505.859 --> 3511.22
they're so covered in

3507.96 --> 3511.2200000000003
it's unbelievable

3511.38 --> 3517.799
just one guy like was part of like four

3514.74 --> 3520.14
secret Services International okay it's

3517.799 --> 3521.88
just like there's nothing you can

3520.14 --> 3525.48
[ __ ] do

3521.88 --> 3528.839
accept all of them dead that's the only

3525.48 --> 3530.94
thing to stop it they have to all die

3528.839 --> 3534.24
all of them

3530.94 --> 3537.98
there's no other way you can't get the

3534.24 --> 3537.9799999999996
individuals it just doesn't work

3539.64 --> 3541.819
foreign

3545.52 --> 3550.14
what the [ __ ] am I supposed to do even

3547.74 --> 3552.9199999999996
what get myself killed get myself a

3550.14 --> 3552.92
bullet in the back

3557.52 --> 3564.299
or organize a trial I don't even have

3562.38 --> 3566.7000000000003
I could just point at a couple of people

3564.299 --> 3570.359
and then with what what evidence they'll

3566.7 --> 3572.7599999999998
literally just tell the card I'm crazy

3570.359 --> 3575.5789999999997
and they could actually argue for that

3572.76 --> 3577.44
because I was [ __ ] insane for a while

3575.579 --> 3580.1400000000003
after that

3577.44 --> 3582.48
so it's there is nothing I can do and

3580.14 --> 3584.22
even if I would manage to actually

3582.48 --> 3585.839
expose some of that [ __ ] guess what

3584.22 --> 3589.6189999999997
they're gonna do they're gonna say this

3585.839 --> 3591.839
is classified operation yeah so what the

3589.619 --> 3593.94
[ __ ] am I supposed to do about it

3591.839 --> 3597.98
nothing

3593.94 --> 3597.98
I can do nothing about it

3600.72 --> 3604.9399999999996
offer

3602.64 --> 3604.94
foreign

3638.099 --> 3640.76
foreign

3643.62 --> 3646.92
[Applause]

3671.359 --> 3677.4
part of all of it was what the most

3674.46 --> 3681.0
insane part of the whole thing was

3677.4 --> 3682.859
that these people running that thing

3681.0 --> 3686.839
or my age

3682.859 --> 3686.839
they were in their 20s

3688.02 --> 3691.579
it

3689.46 --> 3691.579
I

3696.359 --> 3701.72
I still can't handle it

3707.52 --> 3710.359
foreign

3738.839 --> 3741.38
yeah

3741.66 --> 3746.22
so yeah in that sense I can definitely

3743.76 --> 3748.619
go can confirm some of the stories that

3746.22 --> 3750.359
go out there and that is that yeah the

3748.619 --> 3755.2400000000002
Secret Service runs these torture

3750.359 --> 3755.24
dungeons they do it they do it

3762.78 --> 3766.86
I

3763.73 --> 3766.86
[Music]

3768.619 --> 3775.94
yeah so excuse me if I lost a little

3771.96 --> 3775.94
faith in humanity after that point

3777.839 --> 3780.02
foreign

3807.54 --> 3812.18
I still have the belief that I can grow

3809.579 --> 3812.1800000000003
out of this

3813.72 --> 3818.52
I just

3816.059 --> 3820.2000000000003
thing is I keep playing over and over in

3818.52 --> 3822.72
my head like

3820.2 --> 3825.96
how I got caught up

3822.72 --> 3830.819
with that my arrogance

3825.96 --> 3830.819
my like Unlimited

3832.92 --> 3837.6800000000003
like unlimited courage

3837.839 --> 3841.44
that I was like I thought I was a

3839.819 --> 3844.38
[ __ ] god and I could handle anything

3841.44 --> 3847.04
okay that's what I thought and it was so

3844.38 --> 3847.04
[ __ ] wrong

3849.68 --> 3854.0589999999997
because I can't handle everything

3855.54 --> 3861.0589999999997
I mean they argued that what I got to

3857.88 --> 3862.079
see wasn't even the worst of it okay so

3861.059 --> 3865.52
yeah

3862.079 --> 3868.76
that [ __ ] me up so bad psychologically

3865.52 --> 3868.7599999999998
so bad

3869.22 --> 3876.0589999999997
I couldn't even talk about it to anyone

3872.059 --> 3879.2400000000002
anyone it was that [ __ ] bad

3876.059 --> 3880.5
can you imagine our win not being able

3879.24 --> 3885.4799999999996
to talk

3880.5 --> 3887.88
to anybody okay and I I blabber like

3885.48 --> 3890.46
like nothing else out there I say

3887.88 --> 3892.2000000000003
everything I that was my thing that was

3890.46 --> 3895.14
my thing that it would always just

3892.2 --> 3897.299
immediately say the truth and I think I

3895.14 --> 3900.299
genuinely think that that is the thing

3897.299 --> 3902.52
they tried to break about me

3900.299 --> 3904.319
by just showing me that [ __ ] that's so

3902.52 --> 3907.74
horrific that I would lose

3904.319 --> 3911.16
the will to be able to do that

3907.74 --> 3913.2599999999998
and it it did for a while it did

3911.16 --> 3916.46
actually break

3913.26 --> 3916.46
my speech

3916.98 --> 3923.64
where I just wasn't interested to say

3920.16 --> 3926.42
anything anymore for like a year

3923.64 --> 3926.42
at least

3934.079 --> 3937.38
sounds like a nightmare yeah no [ __ ]

3936.24 --> 3939.0
Nature Boy

3937.38 --> 3941.339
yeah you might be hearing this for the

3939.0 --> 3943.68
first time but I keep saying that it's

3941.339 --> 3946.339
like yeah I've been like through literal

3943.68 --> 3949.5589999999997
hell it's not just a dark World Vision

3946.339 --> 3952.2
I've seen literal hellish things I

3949.559 --> 3955.02
learned hellish things

3952.2 --> 3959.299
that absolutely broke

3955.02 --> 3959.299
my good confidence in humanity

3959.46 --> 3964.28
it's never really been restored after

3961.98 --> 3964.28
that

3972.119 --> 3977.2200000000003
let's go ahead and room for a small

3974.099 --> 3978.2400000000002
garden would you choose to initially or

3977.22 --> 3980.7599999999998
what

3978.24 --> 3982.3799999999997
what would I choose to initially grow I

3980.76 --> 3985.5200000000004
don't know herbs

3982.38 --> 3987.5
basic herbs

3985.52 --> 3990.72
basil

3987.5 --> 3992.819
oregano mint that's something I would

3990.72 --> 3994.859
definitely go for these days maybe

3992.819 --> 3997.68
Tomatoes I don't know some basic stuff

3994.859 --> 4000.88
is what I would start out with

3997.68 --> 4000.8799999999997
I know how to do that

4008.059 --> 4012.92
anyway I gotta take a two minute break

4010.94 --> 4015.5
I have to figure out what the hell to

4012.92 --> 4018.5
call this show

4015.5 --> 4018.5
foreign

4077.78 --> 4079.96
foreign

4098.06 --> 4101.06
foreign

4107.6 --> 4110.679
I got the title

4112.819 --> 4117.219
a glimpse into Pandora's Box

4118.58 --> 4121.649
[Applause]

4123.259 --> 4128.62
I think that would be a very fitting

4125.48 --> 4128.62
title for today's show

4134.08 --> 4140.259
right anyway still got a half an hour

4137.54 --> 4140.259
left for the show

4147.699 --> 4154.48
is anybody still here beside you steamy

4151.46 --> 4154.4800000000005
traveler Nature Boy

4163.819 --> 4166.4800000000005
foreign

4207.02 --> 4210.02
foreign

4213.8 --> 4218.5
by the way I got the whole bunch of new

4215.9 --> 4218.5
subscribers

4218.96 --> 4225.5
it's the 2.66

4222.46 --> 4227.4800000000005
2.66 subscribers

4225.5 --> 4231.5
although that's something weird going on

4227.48 --> 4233.54
with Creator Studios like the comments

4231.5 --> 4236.0
the comment moderation has gone all

4233.54 --> 4238.4
[ __ ] up

4236.0 --> 4241.88
like it just doesn't even show the new

4238.4 --> 4245.0599999999995
comments anymore in the specific

4241.88 --> 4249.28
show see the new comments

4245.06 --> 4249.280000000001
thing it's really weird I don't get it

4256.28 --> 4261.219
hey Jason Brown

4258.5 --> 4261.219
let's see you

4264.38 --> 4268.9400000000005
ha

4265.699 --> 4271.5199999999995
by the way look at look at the tags I

4268.94 --> 4274.879999999999
actually removed hashtag Freemasons and

4271.52 --> 4277.159000000001
hashtag tartaria

4274.88 --> 4279.8
and now it replaced it now it's just

4277.159 --> 4282.739
Black Swan Giants free energy I think

4279.8 --> 4286.0
that's a much more welcome

4282.739 --> 4286.0
set of hashtags

4290.0 --> 4294.14
although free energy is technically

4291.86 --> 4296.42
[ __ ] in my opinion but it is like

4294.14 --> 4299.8
the catch-all phrase for just people in

4296.42 --> 4299.8
Alternative Energy creation

4299.9 --> 4303.82
thank you

4300.86 --> 4303.82
but yeah

4306.8 --> 4312.14
so it's it's really just YouTube Just

4310.64 --> 4314.84
picks

4312.14 --> 4316.88
picks out the hashtags of whatever

4314.84 --> 4318.4400000000005
hashtag stuff you have in the

4316.88 --> 4320.86
description box that's how it works

4318.44 --> 4320.86
apparently

4321.32 --> 4327.139999999999
and and it always chooses the same order

4324.92 --> 4329.12
apparently so even if you have a giant

4327.14 --> 4331.820000000001
list it's not it's not going to randomly

4329.12 --> 4333.92
pick although it might at the start but

4331.82 --> 4335.48
then it later will always give you a

4333.92 --> 4337.34
standard

4335.48 --> 4340.28
as it has bitten

4337.34 --> 4343.28
so I just removed the Freemasons and the

4340.28 --> 4343.28
tartaria

4345.199 --> 4350.659
and now it's giving other hashtags at

4348.679 --> 4353.56
the top so yeah

4350.659 --> 4353.5599999999995
that worked

4366.4 --> 4371.179
anyway I'm gonna whine a bit about

4368.719 --> 4375.14
support I really need it

4371.179 --> 4380.0
I hope I hope yeah

4375.14 --> 4381.88
you will be able to give me some

4380.0 --> 4385.04
maybe Today's Show

4381.88 --> 4386.84
might convince you that supporting me

4385.04 --> 4389.92
might be worth it

4386.84 --> 4389.92
I really need it

4390.14 --> 4394.400000000001
and I think I've been doing some really

4392.0 --> 4397.64
good shows My overall quality of the

4394.4 --> 4399.44
shows have been improving compared to

4397.64 --> 4401.679
say a year ago or a year before that

4399.44 --> 4401.678999999999
even

4402.86 --> 4409.759999999999
and I need support to get around because

4405.98 --> 4412.82
I am my debt is growing and soon I will

4409.76 --> 4415.34
be completely out of maneuverability

4412.82 --> 4418.96
I really need the support So anybody

4415.34 --> 4418.96
that could please do so

4419.739 --> 4425.419999999999
if you want me to talk to talk more

4422.6 --> 4427.64
about Flat Earth subjects then hey let

4425.42 --> 4430.1
me know or bring it up I mean anybody

4427.64 --> 4433.280000000001
could bring up any subject in my chat as

4430.1 --> 4435.14
long as it's not whining about how I ban

4433.28 --> 4437.78
people

4435.14 --> 4442.06
yeah as long as it's an actual subject

4437.78 --> 4442.0599999999995
I'll talk about it so really

4442.1 --> 4446.6
it's up to whoever's in chat you want to

4445.04 --> 4448.04
talk about Flat Earth I'll talk about

4446.6 --> 4449.6
Flat Earth

4448.04 --> 4453.159
you want to talk about something else

4449.6 --> 4453.159000000001
then I'll talk about something else

4460.52 --> 4465.02
but I really need the support

4462.02 --> 4465.02
desperately

4469.4 --> 4475.699
like or I am like

4472.699 --> 4477.799999999999
my system's gonna crash like I will

4475.699 --> 4481.219
literally probably get kicked out of my

4477.8 --> 4483.14
house soon this year somewhere if I

4481.219 --> 4485.9
don't get more support

4483.14 --> 4487.1
because my support has been extremely

4485.9 --> 4489.28
lacking

4487.1 --> 4492.320000000001
it's probably due to overall Financial

4489.28 --> 4495.44
calamities out there I get it

4492.32 --> 4498.739
but I mean I can't keep this up guys I

4495.44 --> 4500.659
really can't I want to I want to do this

4498.739 --> 4503.659
I'm getting better at this but I can't

4500.659 --> 4506.839999999999
if I don't get support

4503.659 --> 4509.9
I will get kicked out of my house okay

4506.84 --> 4512.42
eventually how am I going to

4509.9 --> 4516.639999999999

4512.42 --> 4516.64

4636.199 --> 4641.719

4670.4 --> 4675.259999999999
or you think that everything I'm saying

not continue in March

4724.96 --> 4729.58
okay

4726.679 --> 4729.58
is that clear enough

4733.52 --> 4735.9400000000005
foreign

4738.92 --> 4743.659
50 bucks in a month

4742.4 --> 4747.86
yeah

4743.659 --> 4749.78
that is not enough I cannot survive with

4747.86 --> 4751.4
that

4749.78 --> 4753.62
I cannot

4751.4 --> 4755.78
I need more support

4753.62 --> 4757.88
so please

4755.78 --> 4760.699
make it happen

4757.88 --> 4763.54
or the early bird show ends and my

4760.699 --> 4763.54
channel ends

4775.94 --> 4781.28
and I'm seeing plenty of people throwing

4778.58 --> 4783.38
super cats around

4781.28 --> 4785.3
over at flat swords and the flatter

4783.38 --> 4788.719
debates

4785.3 --> 4791.320000000001
and even QE when he even streams

4788.719 --> 4791.32
so

4793.159 --> 4797.659
maybe just think I'm not worth it well

4795.32 --> 4800.719
okay then I'll [ __ ] go away and you

4797.659 --> 4803.42
can all just go and do your little

4800.719 --> 4805.88
standard procedures out there

4803.42 --> 4808.9400000000005
and enjoy

4805.88 --> 4810.7390000000005
the same thing over and over again

4808.94 --> 4813.199
because I will not be part of that

4810.739 --> 4816.199
anymore then yeah if I don't get support

4813.199 --> 4818.719
on this show I will discontinue being

4816.199 --> 4820.94
part of the Flat Earth debates as well

4818.719 --> 4823.34
I will discontinue all of my internet

4820.94 --> 4826.04
activities

4823.34 --> 4828.860000000001
you understand because I will not have

4826.04 --> 4830.659
time for it anymore and especially not

4828.86 --> 4833.299999999999
patience anymore

4830.659 --> 4835.46
because I will feel like everything I've

4833.3 --> 4838.64
been doing has been taken for granted

4835.46 --> 4843.08
and you were all okay with just letting

4838.64 --> 4845.179
me starve yeah that's not tolerable to

4843.08 --> 4848.5
me

4845.179 --> 4848.5
so support me

4850.76 --> 4858.159000000001
or I will go away

4853.159 --> 4858.159
and there will be no more Arwin for you

4858.39 --> 4863.049
[Music]

4868.88 --> 4874.219
and I will use my skills and energy on

4871.58 --> 4877.5199999999995
other people then

4874.219 --> 4878.65
do an end of actually getting paid

4877.52 --> 4881.700000000001
you understand

4878.65 --> 4881.7

4971.179 --> 4976.04
oh yeah by the way I'll stop it now is

4974.0 --> 4978.38
it fine yeah I thought so is it fight

4976.04 --> 4980.36
the fat Earth okay oh nice it's him

4978.38 --> 4981.679
Craig Burton thank you very much Greg

4980.36 --> 4984.08
Burton

4981.679 --> 4986.3
I mean yeah

4984.08 --> 4989.54
that's what I'm talking about thank you

4986.3 --> 4993.62
so much man you you just

4989.54 --> 4997.28
you just save my show for the time being

4993.62 --> 5000.46
at least and save my neck because I

4997.28 --> 5002.639999999999
didn't have money for food or smokes or

5000.46 --> 5002.64
anything

5004.239 --> 5007.44
so thank you very much

5012.88 --> 5018.82
and I'll stop now

5014.92 --> 5021.1
you need your show my show you do

5018.82 --> 5024.36
really

5021.1 --> 5024.360000000001
oh wow okay

5024.46 --> 5031.3
I appreciate it

5026.92 --> 5034.0
I like to hear more about why though

5031.3 --> 5036.52
I I'd love to hear that

5034.0 --> 5040.12
if you still feel like sharing that I

5036.52 --> 5043.120000000001
mean I was kind of angry and all that

5040.12 --> 5045.34
maybe that's it

5043.12 --> 5048.46
I don't understand sometimes why people

5045.34 --> 5052.4800000000005
even like me or my show

5048.46 --> 5055.719
but that's because I will like I can't

5052.48 --> 5057.759999999999
I'm an empath okay I can figure out what

5055.719 --> 5060.64
people respond like what what's going on

5057.76 --> 5064.360000000001
on the inside but I have

5060.64 --> 5066.58
not so much that capability when people

5064.36 --> 5069.46
behold me

5066.58 --> 5070.96
it's like the one place where I can't

5069.46 --> 5072.88
really look

5070.96 --> 5075.159
so I

5072.88 --> 5077.4400000000005
it's very hard for me to size up what

5075.159 --> 5078.46
people even think or feel about me and

5077.44 --> 5080.379999999999
my show

5078.46 --> 5082.96
in general

5080.38 --> 5085.78
and to the point where even if somebody

5082.96 --> 5087.82
says like oh you're doing great I'm like

5085.78 --> 5089.739
thinking like but am I really are you

5087.82 --> 5092.679
just saying that because

5089.739 --> 5094.718999999999
you want me to feel good about myself

5092.679 --> 5096.6990000000005
because I'm probably not doing great and

5094.719 --> 5098.62
you picked up on that and so you've just

5096.699 --> 5103.44
being supportive right

5098.62 --> 5103.44
so I it's very hard for me to tell

5105.699 --> 5111.639999999999
when I am involved

5107.98 --> 5114.159
in what I'm trying to analyze

5111.64 --> 5115.780000000001
I'm very easy to figure out what

5114.159 --> 5117.879999999999
somebody feels about somebody else

5115.78 --> 5119.98
though it can vary instantly like

5117.88 --> 5121.36
instantly right like that's that's what

5119.98 --> 5123.699
they feel this is what's going on I can

5121.36 --> 5126.219
describe it in many ways but when it

5123.699 --> 5128.98
comes to like oh but what do they think

5126.219 --> 5131.14
about me then it's like I just can't

5128.98 --> 5135.0
tell I just can't tell it

5131.14 --> 5135.0
it's blocked it's weird

5141.34 --> 5145.900000000001
but maybe it's also because I don't know

5143.14 --> 5148.719
I've just been people manipulated me a

5145.9 --> 5150.759999999999
lot in my youth

5148.719 --> 5153.159
so even in my youth I would be like very

5150.76 --> 5155.38
forward and honest and other people

5153.159 --> 5158.5
wouldn't and they eventually like just

5155.38 --> 5161.26
had an added to to respond to me

5158.5 --> 5164.98
to get me off their back

5161.26 --> 5169.0
so people were literally just not being

5164.98 --> 5170.5599999999995
honest to me in my youth a lot just to

5169.0 --> 5172.48
avoid me

5170.56 --> 5175.42
because I would be too confrontational

5172.48 --> 5177.339999999999
to them I wouldn't I would get inside

5175.42 --> 5179.4400000000005
with their feelings and they didn't want

5177.34 --> 5181.360000000001
that and that's very logical of course

5179.44 --> 5184.32
but this is just the way I function I

5181.36 --> 5184.32
was so interested

5187.96 --> 5195.28
in how in people's internal world like

5191.02 --> 5198.88
as as a pre-teen even Okay so

5195.28 --> 5202.179
but I because of that

5198.88 --> 5205.6
I I have trouble reading people when it

5202.179 --> 5207.639
comes to their opinions Etc about me I

5205.6 --> 5209.620000000001
just can't tell

5207.639 --> 5210.88
whether they're actually genuinely or

5209.62 --> 5213.699
not

5210.88 --> 5215.38
it's much easier to tell when they're if

5213.699 --> 5217.599999999999
they're genuine or not towards something

5215.38 --> 5219.76
else

5217.6 --> 5222.9400000000005
but when it comes to towards me then I

5219.76 --> 5225.219
just can I can't tell really

5222.94 --> 5228.178999999999
and and that's also why I really

5225.219 --> 5231.76
appreciate when people just genuinely

5228.179 --> 5234.04
give me compliments or say things like I

5231.76 --> 5237.04
need your show because

5234.04 --> 5239.26
like that's a shock to me

5237.04 --> 5242.699
because I don't feel that

5239.26 --> 5242.6990000000005
people have to say that

5245.679 --> 5252.159
and I wish I could feel it I wish I can

5249.04 --> 5254.26
I wish I could just feel that

5252.159 --> 5256.719
maybe I will be able to at some point

5254.26 --> 5257.860000000001
maybe if I'm doing even better more

5256.719 --> 5260.86
stable

5257.86 --> 5264.759999999999
that I will be able to do that

5260.86 --> 5270.12
but I've always had trouble sizing up

5264.76 --> 5270.12
what's going on in people when they

5270.34 --> 5274.84
address me or

5272.32 --> 5277.84
give their opinion about me it's always

5274.84 --> 5281.38
been difficult

5277.84 --> 5284.32
because yeah it's just

5281.38 --> 5287.08
my internal world has a strong tendency

5284.32 --> 5290.139
to kind of like take over that field and

5287.08 --> 5291.5199999999995
fill it in for me and that's obviously a

5290.139 --> 5293.1990000000005
protection mechanism it's a

5291.52 --> 5297.1
psychological protection mechanism

5293.199 --> 5300.339999999999
because I was bullied a lot in my youth

5297.1 --> 5303.400000000001
like by groups by like entire the entire

5300.34 --> 5305.5
class and I would always just

5303.4 --> 5307.42
basically be in a psychologically

5305.5 --> 5311.02
torturous scenario

5307.42 --> 5313.12
where I would be so isolated I would

5311.02 --> 5315.820000000001
literally like feel like I'm on an

5313.12 --> 5317.86
island with a coconut as a friend like

5315.82 --> 5319.78
that like coconut with a face drawn on

5317.86 --> 5321.639
it right even though I was literally

5319.78 --> 5324.34
surrounded by people

5321.639 --> 5326.58
and so when people then address you you

5324.34 --> 5326.58
just

5326.739 --> 5331.419999999999
you interpret it differently because you

5329.139 --> 5333.9400000000005
can't actually trust them enough to

5331.42 --> 5335.5
actually listen because as soon as I

5333.94 --> 5337.178999999999
would actually listen and start

5335.5 --> 5341.58
believing them they would immediately

5337.179 --> 5341.58
try to trick me and [ __ ] me over again

5341.86 --> 5346.9
it was really bad like that

5344.32 --> 5349.299999999999
at times in school

5346.9 --> 5351.58
not always but it when it would be like

5349.3 --> 5354.34
that it would be really bad and like

5351.58 --> 5357.34
everybody would like really like spit on

5354.34 --> 5358.900000000001
me I've had where like

5357.34 --> 5361.6
like

5358.9 --> 5366.9
people my classmates would literally

5361.6 --> 5366.900000000001
spit on me okay that [ __ ] bad

5370.57 --> 5376.179
[Music]

5373.179 --> 5376.179
foreign

5384.42 --> 5388.56
okay Jason Brown that's cool

5393.1 --> 5396.58
kids are mean to each other for sure

5394.78 --> 5398.32
yeah and they had but in that class and

5396.58 --> 5401.26
it was the Waldorf School it was really

5398.32 --> 5405.659
the worst there but it it's it was a

5401.26 --> 5405.659000000001
challenge but it was really bad in a way

5406.0 --> 5410.199
my parents actually wanted to pull me

5408.34 --> 5413.08
off that school did you know and I

5410.199 --> 5414.879999999999
refused I said no I am going to finish

5413.08 --> 5417.159
this I'm going to win

5414.88 --> 5421.12
[Music]

5417.159 --> 5424.839999999999
I was that invested

5421.12 --> 5428.32
that's assault scumbag yeah assault of a

5424.84 --> 5431.1
of a a nine-year-old

5428.32 --> 5431.099999999999
oh

5431.44 --> 5435.879999999999
yeah when nine years old nine-year-old

5433.54 --> 5438.6
kids do that it's not assault it's just

5435.88 --> 5438.6
bastards

5446.38 --> 5451.3
right but that wasn't even the worst of

5448.6 --> 5453.820000000001
it I mean the worst of it is that they

5451.3 --> 5456.46
would literally just have activities and

5453.82 --> 5458.5199999999995
every time exclude me like oh we're

5456.46 --> 5461.32
gonna play football or all we're doing

5458.52 --> 5464.219
this or we're and it's like oh can I

5461.32 --> 5464.219
come along no

5466.239 --> 5471.82
they isolated me and that was the most

5469.0 --> 5474.58
torturous thing ever because then I just

5471.82 --> 5476.44
felt freaking isolated that got me like

5474.58 --> 5479.4
really in a bad spot

5476.44 --> 5481.9
because I do not like to be excluded

5479.4 --> 5484.179
these days if I feel like I'm being

5481.9 --> 5487.54
actively excluded I immediately break

5484.179 --> 5489.9400000000005
with the group forever or I get like

5487.54 --> 5491.56
really dominant and aggressive like are

5489.94 --> 5494.199
you [ __ ] with me

5491.56 --> 5498.360000000001
You're Gonna Let Me In

5494.199 --> 5498.36
or you'll never see me again

5498.52 --> 5504.159000000001
that's what I'm like people like

5501.46 --> 5507.4800000000005
actively exclude me from a group you you

5504.159 --> 5507.48
have a problem with me

5508.179 --> 5516.54
because I got some trauma response

5512.02 --> 5516.540000000001
things inside of me to deal with that

5518.02 --> 5524.219
and people a lot of people do kind of

5520.659 --> 5528.28
intuitively pick up on that

5524.219 --> 5531.1
it's like yeah because I'm not a wussy

5528.28 --> 5532.179
anymore I used to be a really bad wussy

5531.1 --> 5534.400000000001
in a sense

5532.179 --> 5536.02
because I was such

5534.4 --> 5538.78
a good guy

5536.02 --> 5542.34
and guess what as a [ __ ] good guy you

5538.78 --> 5542.34
tend to become like a wussy

5542.44 --> 5549.5199999999995
and if if you then get tortured or

5545.679 --> 5551.62
whatever or bullied then the demon like

5549.52 --> 5554.9800000000005
a Vengeance demon just pops up and

5551.62 --> 5557.0199999999995
basically changes everything

5554.98 --> 5560.5
right so I would be I would be I'm the

5557.02 --> 5562.4800000000005
nicest freaking person ever in person I

5560.5 --> 5564.1
really am why did you ask the roommates

5562.48 --> 5568.36
that actually get me

5564.1 --> 5570.639
I am the nicest [ __ ] person you will

5568.36 --> 5572.44
ever meet face to face

5570.639 --> 5574.6
really

5572.44 --> 5577.178999999999
really

5574.6 --> 5580.4800000000005
I open every door

5577.179 --> 5583.6
for a woman or even a guy I help out

5580.48 --> 5585.94
every chance I get I love it

5583.6 --> 5587.1990000000005
I love other people around me to feel

5585.94 --> 5588.759999999999
good

5587.199 --> 5590.739
and feel

5588.76 --> 5594.1
welcome and all that

5590.739 --> 5596.86
I'm not like overdoing it or anything

5594.1 --> 5598.54
but just in everything I do that's

5596.86 --> 5599.98
important to me and I've always been

5598.54 --> 5603.46
like that

5599.98 --> 5606.94
but when people then abuse it

5603.46 --> 5608.9800000000005
or try to manipulate me or like hate me

5606.94 --> 5611.678999999999
for even being like that and then

5608.98 --> 5614.98
excluding me then it kind of flips

5611.679 --> 5618.3
around and I get like haunted by

5614.98 --> 5618.299999999999
feelings of vengeance

5618.34 --> 5624.04
and then that good side is suddenly well

5621.88 --> 5626.639
it's flipped around and then it becomes

5624.04 --> 5626.639
not so good

5630.159 --> 5635.259999999999
and a big challenge in my life overall

5633.28 --> 5638.259999999999
especially throughout my teams is to

5635.26 --> 5640.84
walk away when that happens instead of

5638.26 --> 5642.04
attack

5640.84 --> 5645.219
foreign

5642.04 --> 5647.679
because I could be kind of aggressive in

5645.219 --> 5649.9
my teens if people did act like that I

5647.679 --> 5652.36
would actually like

5649.9 --> 5655.659
like what you want to fight

5652.36 --> 5657.4
what you think you can just put me out

5655.659 --> 5660.0
of the group what you think I'm not

5657.4 --> 5660.0
worthy enough

5664.92 --> 5670.06
so I had to basically accept like yeah I

5668.199 --> 5672.159
am going there will always be people

5670.06 --> 5674.38
that will be extremely uncomfortable

5672.159 --> 5677.379999999999
with me around because I literally see

5674.38 --> 5680.02
everything that they are very very used

5677.38 --> 5682.78
to hiding permanently and nobody ever

5680.02 --> 5686.1990000000005
addresses them about it

5682.78 --> 5689.8
and then there's Arwin who absolutely

5686.199 --> 5692.0199999999995
will address those things

5689.8 --> 5694.4800000000005
even if I risk literally getting

5692.02 --> 5696.639
assaulted for it because I I have to do

5694.48 --> 5698.919999999999
it I can see it it's like you're having

5696.639 --> 5701.1990000000005
this issue nobody ever talks about it

5698.92 --> 5703.719
you could potentially deal with it I'm

5701.199 --> 5706.12
like please please fix yourself and then

5703.719 --> 5708.219
they're like get the [ __ ] out of my face

5706.12 --> 5710.38
I never want to see you again

5708.219 --> 5713.699
who the hell are you to just suddenly

5710.38 --> 5713.6990000000005
talk to me about that

5713.92 --> 5720.84
that's happened

5716.02 --> 5720.84
that's happened to me several times

5721.42 --> 5726.46
they're just like I'm just seeing some

5723.88 --> 5728.26
figure and I'm like oh I I see so much

5726.46 --> 5730.42
about you

5728.26 --> 5732.280000000001
that you probably don't know maybe you

5730.42 --> 5735.159
could do this and they'd be like who the

5732.28 --> 5737.739
[ __ ] or how the hell like how did you

5735.159 --> 5740.679
even do that and how dare you

5737.739 --> 5742.9
like how dare you burrow inside of my

5740.679 --> 5745.42
head and figure out things about me that

5742.9 --> 5747.638999999999
nobody's supposed to know about how did

5745.42 --> 5751.8
you do that get the hell out of here

5747.639 --> 5751.8
that's that was a lot of their response

5760.659 --> 5763.259999999999
anyway

5772.06 --> 5777.88
how evil kids are in a reflection of the

5776.08 --> 5779.5599999999995
dark depths of the moral state of our

5777.88 --> 5782.76
courage away I don't even know what it's

5779.56 --> 5782.76
like now I think that

5782.98 --> 5789.4
kids now

5785.62 --> 5794.219
are literally mentally [ __ ]

5789.4 --> 5794.219
compared to when I was a kid

5794.32 --> 5799.179
they are actually [ __ ] on average

5797.02 --> 5801.88
why because it's been normalized

5799.179 --> 5805.4800000000005
weakness has been normalized people

5801.88 --> 5808.4400000000005
think that children being weak is normal

5805.48 --> 5808.44
now

5808.96 --> 5814.679
and that is literally all just turn them

5811.12 --> 5814.679
into jellyfish a lot of them

5814.719 --> 5819.58
and and even the ones that are strong

5817.06 --> 5821.320000000001
will still present themselves as weak

5819.58 --> 5824.199
because that's how you're supposed to do

5821.32 --> 5825.4
it right it's [ __ ] up out there in

5824.199 --> 5827.799999999999
many ways

5825.4 --> 5830.5
there's still some kids with really good

5827.8 --> 5833.139
parents that don't have that at all they

5830.5 --> 5835.06
somehow maneuver through all of it but I

5833.139 --> 5840.4800000000005
mean it's worse now than when I was a

5835.06 --> 5840.4800000000005
kid it's much worse than in the 80s

5841.06 --> 5844.139
much worse

5844.78 --> 5849.099999999999
because in a way the kids there they did

5847.0 --> 5851.679
have like their own philosophy and they

5849.1 --> 5854.1990000000005
they were doing that what they do even

5851.679 --> 5856.92
the bullying they would argue why they

5854.199 --> 5856.919999999999
would even do it

5857.98 --> 5863.799999999999
and yeah they were by the way some weird

5860.94 --> 5867.28
Eugenics thoughts also going around

5863.8 --> 5869.92
among the kids and teachers would never

5867.28 --> 5872.199
bring that [ __ ] up nor I don't even know

5869.92 --> 5874.84
if they were behind probably not maybe

5872.199 --> 5877.9
but if they were in secret but some of

5874.84 --> 5879.1
the kids in that school would get all

5877.9 --> 5881.62
eugenics

5879.1 --> 5883.54
and it would literally just start saying

5881.62 --> 5886.599999999999
like yeah you're you're just a stupid

5883.54 --> 5889.26
Half Breed and she did they call me that

5886.6 --> 5889.26
yeah

5889.36 --> 5894.219
thank you

5890.98 --> 5896.799999999999
and say like yeah you just

5894.219 --> 5899.02
we don't care about you you're not

5896.8 --> 5901.54
you're not a worthy human being you're

5899.02 --> 5904.179
just a stupid half-breed like people

5901.54 --> 5906.4
would tell me that kids

5904.179 --> 5908.62
now of course they obviously did that to

5906.4 --> 5910.42
bully me but still it's like such a

5908.62 --> 5912.699
shock

5910.42 --> 5915.4
that somebody would say that like I

5912.699 --> 5917.5
would never say that to somebody as a

5915.4 --> 5920.199
kid even

5917.5 --> 5921.58
I would never like separate myself from

5920.199 --> 5923.32
somebody else

5921.58 --> 5926.92
like that

5923.32 --> 5929.94
and say like you're not a human being

5926.92 --> 5929.9400000000005
compared to me

5931.12 --> 5934.679
you know kids there did do that

5934.96 --> 5942.34
anyway I got through it I survived it

5939.82 --> 5944.98
I mean that overall period was in

5942.34 --> 5946.54
relation actually good for me and

5944.98 --> 5948.638999999999
strengthening because it was a challenge

5946.54 --> 5951.28
I needed a challenge and I got it there

5948.639 --> 5953.62
it's not for no reason that I insisted

5951.28 --> 5957.28
on setting out the entire school there

5953.62 --> 5959.8
yeah that thing was brutal but it was

5957.28 --> 5963.219
helpful yeah now if you compare that to

5959.8 --> 5965.1990000000005
what happened like a decade later what I

5963.219 --> 5970.26
talked about earlier in this show now

5965.199 --> 5970.259999999999
that thing that literally broke me

5971.02 --> 5976.900000000001
now that was an actual break

5973.719 --> 5979.2390000000005
yeah I mean the [ __ ] in that school was

5976.9 --> 5981.339999999999
punishing it was challenging and it got

5979.239 --> 5983.919999999999
like Nightmare and crying in my bed

5981.34 --> 5986.38
sometimes but I got through it and I

5983.92 --> 5987.76
felt stronger at the end of the ride of

5986.38 --> 5991.2390000000005
that school

5987.76 --> 5993.820000000001
but what I saw yeah

5991.239 --> 5997.0599999999995
way after that that there's nothing I

5993.82 --> 6001.5
could learn for it only broke me and it

5997.06 --> 6004.679
it unleashed the rage win in me in a way

6001.5 --> 6006.48
that I'd never experienced before

6004.679 --> 6008.28
but I couldn't do anything with it

6006.48 --> 6009.599999999999
that's why Ray twin has mostly been

6008.28 --> 6012.0
smothered

6009.6 --> 6015.06
You could argue that it even first

6012.0 --> 6016.5
opened up for the very first time in its

6015.06 --> 6019.8
real form

6016.5 --> 6022.02
in episode 82 of the early bird show

6019.8 --> 6024.42
because before that I would just never

6022.02 --> 6027.659000000001
open it up ever

6024.42 --> 6030.179
from the first time it came in me is

6027.659 --> 6031.799999999999
like this is going to get me killed that

6030.179 --> 6035.04
was my first input like this thing is

6031.8 --> 6038.400000000001
going to get me killed I have to not

6035.04 --> 6040.56
feed in it I have to like keep it a

6038.4 --> 6043.739
secret keep it safe keep it inside so

6040.56 --> 6046.1990000000005
that I would not be possessed by that

6043.739 --> 6049.379999999999
and get myself killed

6046.199 --> 6051.419999999999
that's what it did to me that ex that

6049.38 --> 6055.58
experience the glimpse into the

6051.42 --> 6055.58
Pandora's Box that's my show title

6057.719 --> 6061.7390000000005
wait the show

6059.28 --> 6063.679
is gonna round out now it's been very

6061.739 --> 6067.919999999999
intense

6063.679 --> 6071.219
a bit Broody and dark perhaps

6067.92 --> 6073.56
but I hope that you guys still

6071.219 --> 6075.9800000000005
could see that I have learned from it

6073.56 --> 6075.9800000000005
all and

6076.26 --> 6079.56
like everything happens with a purpose

6078.239 --> 6082.5599999999995
everything

6079.56 --> 6084.3
and I've never lost that notion it's

6082.56 --> 6087.360000000001
just that at some point when you're

6084.3 --> 6089.58
fatigued you just see chaos when there

6087.36 --> 6091.08
is actually order and that's how I feel

6089.58 --> 6093.3
about it I don't fully understand

6091.08 --> 6097.679
exactly

6093.3 --> 6099.84
why God put that on my path yet but I

6097.679 --> 6101.4
trust that it was for a good reason even

6099.84 --> 6104.6
though it seemed to have completely

6101.4 --> 6104.599999999999
broken me when it happened

6107.82 --> 6115.739
but yeah I'm out of it

6112.199 --> 6118.5199999999995
more much more than before it only took

6115.739 --> 6118.5199999999995
me like 20 years

6119.46 --> 6126.179
and I still trust God despite all of it

6122.82 --> 6128.5199999999995
right so anyway I'm rounding out thanks

6126.179 --> 6130.4400000000005
