73.159 --> 80.52000000000001
welcome to Flat Earth early bird number

76.82 --> 82.25899999999999
1732 I'm your host Arwin and before I

80.52 --> 84.89999999999999
start the show please don't forget to

82.259 --> 87.659
share it on any platform you theme fit

84.9 --> 89.28
and if you haven't already subscribe to

87.659 --> 92.4
my channel and hit the Bell notification

89.28 --> 94.74
so you know when I'm going live which is

92.4 --> 96.479
normally 1pm Amsterdam time in weekdays

94.74 --> 99.29899999999999
and 2PM Amsterdam time in the weekend

96.479 --> 101.579
and please also do support me through

99.299 --> 102.84
the PayPal and the patreon that will be

101.579 --> 105.86
much appreciated

102.84 --> 105.86
and yeah

106.259 --> 112.7
please support your local Arwin

108.78 --> 112.7
can't keep running this without support

113.52 --> 116.479
so yeah

116.52 --> 122.0
anyway the weather today is yeah very

119.22 --> 122.0
similar to yesterday

123.479 --> 128.47899999999998
Channel

124.799 --> 128.479
a little bit cloudy

128.759 --> 135.379
does seem there was some

131.52 --> 135.37900000000002
Trails involved

138.959 --> 144.31900000000002
but yeah it's still decently sunny

145.86 --> 152.42000000000002
and just a little bit of wind

149.04 --> 152.42
so yeah kind of nice

153.66 --> 157.459
plants are just fine with it

164.28 --> 169.28
right

166.8 --> 169.28
all right

172.739 --> 179.28
so

175.64 --> 182.27999999999997
it's Wednesday the 27th of September

179.28 --> 182.28
2023

186.48 --> 192.01899999999998
temperature is 19 degrees Celsius right

189.3 --> 192.019
makes sense

194.4 --> 197.4
right

201.12 --> 206.22
so I'm starting a little late again it's

202.86 --> 207.72000000000003
because I well I slept pretty late

206.22 --> 210.0
thanks

207.72 --> 213.06
forgot to rush it to kind of like get

210.0 --> 215.78
the show set up and all that

213.06 --> 215.78
so I'm here

216.599 --> 221.959
and hopefully somebody will show up that

219.42 --> 221.95899999999997
will be great

236.04 --> 239.94
I wasn't sure if I was even gonna show

238.2 --> 243.11999999999998
up today

239.94 --> 245.22
since I think I said yesterday I want

243.12 --> 249.019
the PayPal or no show but I don't

245.22 --> 249.019
remember I couldn't even find it back

253.7 --> 259.15999999999997
but uh yeah I'm just I was just gonna do

256.739 --> 259.15999999999997
a show

259.199 --> 265.199
unless nobody shows up

262.32 --> 267.5
and then yeah there's not gonna be a lot

265.199 --> 267.5
of show

275.94 --> 279.74
right anyway Flat Earth debates

278.04 --> 285.54
yesterday

279.74 --> 288.84000000000003
uh went okay got I was kind of agitated

285.54 --> 291.06
and everybody was super rumpacy

288.84 --> 294.44
like during the live show so I kind of

291.06 --> 294.44
like bolt it there

295.02 --> 301.19899999999996
after Nathan just kept yelling at me for

298.62 --> 303.0
literally being a constructive part of

301.199 --> 304.91900000000004
the conversation and I was kind of

303.0 --> 309.419
[ __ ] annoyed by that

304.919 --> 312.479
but uh later I did join back during the

309.419 --> 314.75899999999996
after show and that was just great

312.479 --> 319.5
I mean it was a pretty nice show after

314.759 --> 322.22
that lasted very long too after show

319.5 --> 322.22
very long

324.06 --> 326.539
right

327.419 --> 333.06
uh yeah a lot lots of discussion about

330.6 --> 336.66
reichi

333.06 --> 339.18
I put down my view on it and at first

336.66 --> 341.22
everybody's not really paying attention

339.18 --> 343.68
and in the after show in the end

341.22 --> 344.759
literally everybody was echoing what I

343.68 --> 347.96
was saying

344.759 --> 347.96000000000004
what I had said

349.68 --> 355.62
that she's right she's like trading Flat

352.5 --> 358.86
Earth and Globe earth like it's their

355.62 --> 361.44
boyfriends and she's playing them out

358.86 --> 363.3
turning it into a tug of war and that's

361.44 --> 365.96
what she's doing

363.3 --> 365.96000000000004
I feel

367.199 --> 373.88
she might also be just completely

369.06 --> 373.88
exiting the scene like uh

374.699 --> 378.84000000000003
some people thought she was like or like

377.16 --> 381.78000000000003
Tony brought that up like she was acting

378.84 --> 384.23999999999995
like a ranty and so was jiren but I mean

381.78 --> 387.59999999999997
jiren's not gonna go away and I yeah I'm

384.24 --> 390.74
not sure if rage is gonna go away either

387.6 --> 390.74
like ranty

391.02 --> 393.97999999999996
I think she's just gonna continue doing

392.88 --> 395.46
what she had been doing

393.98 --> 397.91900000000004
[Music]

395.46 --> 402.02
but yeah who knows anyway hello Richard

397.919 --> 402.02
G first in chat good to see you

404.84 --> 411.17999999999995
right so yeah the uh

408.9 --> 413.63899999999995
the swollen finger situation is

411.18 --> 416.06
completely gone down now I even like had

413.639 --> 416.06
to like

416.52 --> 421.62
pay my attention like hey didn't I have

419.58 --> 424.21999999999997
an issue with this finger but no not

421.62 --> 424.22
anymore now

425.16 --> 427.88000000000005
oops

437.88 --> 443.58
I am feeling a bit wonky I think that

440.46 --> 447.56
just like the the processing of it

443.58 --> 447.56
makes me a little wonky

447.84 --> 451.5
so yeah that should be gone by the way

449.88 --> 455.71999999999997
by tomorrow

451.5 --> 455.72
because yeah I mean it is really gone

456.539 --> 459.56
but uh

460.199 --> 463.46000000000004
yeah that's about it

470.099 --> 475.319
all right and for the rest I've been

471.66 --> 478.319
working very hard on bulldash

475.319 --> 480.24
it's becoming pretty big I almost made

478.319 --> 482.639
it like

480.24 --> 483.90000000000003
yeah I'm risking over complicating

482.639 --> 486.96000000000004
things

483.9 --> 490.63899999999995
but then like I'm yeah I'm keeping it

486.96 --> 490.63899999999995
under control but I mean this is

491.819 --> 496.38
it's becoming very

494.28 --> 499.73999999999995
big

496.38 --> 503.4
as in like all the options that happen

499.74 --> 505.379
and I'm like reclassifying certain types

503.4 --> 507.78
of actions

505.379 --> 509.819
so I have to like continually rephrase

507.78 --> 511.5
what I'm saying at first it started out

509.819 --> 515.419
just like saying like oh roughly

511.5 --> 515.419
describing what it's supposed to do

517.74 --> 522.539
and but it's just based on like yeah

519.899 --> 525.48
sort of describing but now I'm like

522.539 --> 528.18
defining actions like actually defining

525.48 --> 530.94
the actions precisely so that the word

528.18 --> 533.16
is used it's a very specific action that

530.94 --> 535.08
is summarized

533.16 --> 537.06
well in that

535.08 --> 540.38
so I didn't have to write out all the

537.06 --> 540.38
details every freaking time

541.92 --> 546.9799999999999
and uh yeah I mean it is working out

555.06 --> 561.4799999999999
and I'm continually just kind of

557.1 --> 563.519
frustrated that I can't actually test it

561.48 --> 568.08
because I'm seeing things like in my

563.519 --> 570.12
mind how it happens but yeah that's it

568.08 --> 571.5600000000001
I'm kind of frustrated that I just can't

570.12 --> 574.5600000000001
test

571.56 --> 577.5
the things that I'm like writing down it

574.56 --> 580.9799999999999
would be really cool if I just like had

577.5 --> 582.18
an engine ready like a check engine like

580.98 --> 584.399
a field

582.18 --> 585.42
in which a level could be that I could

584.399 --> 587.16
just

585.42 --> 590.5799999999999
fill out

587.16 --> 593.3389999999999
and then basically start programming

590.58 --> 596.279
with the scanning and set setting

593.339 --> 599.339
whatever in the level

596.279 --> 602.54
because then I could literally life test

599.339 --> 602.5400000000001
like what I'm doing

602.76 --> 606.26
I wish I could do that

606.42 --> 612.8389999999999
I wish I had that option available that

609.779 --> 614.459
would make things a lot quicker I think

612.839 --> 616.6800000000001
and yeah

614.459 --> 618.8389999999999
because then I could have real certainty

616.68 --> 620.88
with everything

618.839 --> 622.74
because I'm actually testing it so it's

620.88 --> 625.519
like literally happening and it's not

622.74 --> 625.519
just described

626.04 --> 631.88
yeah not in that position to do that

629.04 --> 631.88
unfortunately

632.64 --> 637.5
I mean maybe like a programmer person

634.98 --> 640.279
could help me

637.5 --> 640.279
with that

640.74 --> 646.22
to make like a little system so that I

643.56 --> 646.2199999999999
could use that

658.32 --> 661.5790000000001
but uh yeah

664.2 --> 668.82
I'm working on it uh it's gonna take

667.019 --> 672.5600000000001
some more time it's it's a lot of

668.82 --> 672.5600000000001
organization work at this point

675.24 --> 680.66
and like my attention is like going a

677.88 --> 680.66
bit off and on

685.079 --> 691.26
but it's also because a lot of new ideas

688.14 --> 693.0
like about possibilities like have come

691.26 --> 696.18
forward like I've

693.0 --> 699.92
they just keep coming like really good

696.18 --> 699.92
ideas of like what you could do

700.62 --> 706.44
right like for example the vacuum pump

704.399 --> 710.04
block

706.44 --> 712.8000000000001
that creates a vacuum like that was a

710.04 --> 715.38
really good idea

712.8 --> 718.8599999999999
let's see what else did I come up with

715.38 --> 722.0
like yeah didn't it I basically Define

718.86 --> 722.0
different robots

727.5 --> 732.12
right and I'm gonna have to also like

729.839 --> 734.82
make up make up my mind as to like how

732.12 --> 736.98
they for example respond to water

734.82 --> 739.2
how everything responds to water does it

736.98 --> 741.54
go in there when it goes in there is

739.2 --> 744.1800000000001
there any obstruction at all or

741.54 --> 746.16
do they like get stuck or something I

744.18 --> 749.399
could make it like that like

746.16 --> 752.2199999999999
and oh yeah seriously I got a density

749.399 --> 755.54
buoyancy system now

752.22 --> 755.5400000000001
like with the water

755.7 --> 759.0600000000001
because

757.14 --> 761.04
like plastic

759.06 --> 762.0
is going to be like defined as really

761.04 --> 764.519
light

762.0 --> 767.399
and plastic will basically instead of

764.519 --> 768.779
fall in water it will float it will fall

767.399 --> 772.98
upward

768.779 --> 775.32
and rubber will just not full will not

772.98 --> 778.5
go up or down it will like middle float

775.32 --> 780.9590000000001
and the rest will fall down so that just

778.5 --> 784.339
changes everything also yeah like the

780.959 --> 784.3389999999999
water effectively is

784.68 --> 789.06
like a background material it will go

787.2 --> 791.76
through

789.06 --> 794.0999999999999
we'll go through boulders

791.76 --> 797.579
it's like go past the space and then the

794.1 --> 800.0400000000001
boulder will be underwater which is like

797.579 --> 802.92
yeah so water can literally like yeah

800.04 --> 806.04
can have like a pile of diamonds and

802.92 --> 810.0
rocks and water will literally like

806.04 --> 812.04
spill and fall on it and through it

810.0 --> 814.2
and if it's like trapped in the bottom

812.04 --> 816.5999999999999
then literally half of that pile of

814.2 --> 819.0
rocks and diamonds will sit in water and

816.6 --> 821.82
the other half will sit on top of it

819.0 --> 824.82
like so that it's like literally another

821.82 --> 826.32
falling thing that can like move through

824.82 --> 829.2600000000001
boulders

826.32 --> 831.48
and that's like that's really big part

829.26 --> 834.98
of the new system

831.48 --> 834.98
and it's just fascinating

835.5 --> 840.54
I really would like to test it

838.139 --> 843.0
so like by the way it changes everything

840.54 --> 845.579
so falling things in water don't

843.0 --> 847.92
actually Crush

845.579 --> 849.3
so you can't have impact destruction in

847.92 --> 854.12
water

849.3 --> 854.12
that's right because this is all like

855.42 --> 859.139
yeah based on

857.339 --> 861.74
physics

859.139 --> 864.48
but then like really

861.74 --> 866.4590000000001
robotifying and making it into very

864.48 --> 872.36
basic actions

866.459 --> 872.3599999999999
so it's like neutral buoyancy float

874.079 --> 880.26
like it's less dense than the medium

876.779 --> 882.0
well then it's gonna float up right or

880.26 --> 884.779
it's more dense than the medium it's

882.0 --> 884.779
gonna fall down

885.959 --> 889.3199999999999
and I'm loving it that I could basically

887.76 --> 893.04
do it

889.32 --> 896.0
do the egg experiment sort of like in

893.04 --> 896.0
this pull the dash

896.399 --> 899.42
like literally

900.12 --> 905.399
and you can now have gas water and

903.66 --> 907.139
vacuum

905.399 --> 909.839
you get it

907.139 --> 913.019
you can literally there is different

909.839 --> 915.2600000000001
mechanics here of basically vacuum

913.019 --> 915.26
weight

915.42 --> 919.399
gas weight and water weight

920.0 --> 927.54
it's in this system and I mean like I

923.94 --> 930.839
was almost like I want to put oil in

927.54 --> 935.24
there I want to have oil as a liquid but

930.839 --> 935.24
I mean that's just like too much

936.6 --> 939.6
like it would make things too

937.92 --> 942.24
complicated it's already crazy enough

939.6 --> 944.6990000000001
that I thought like oh let's put acid in

942.24 --> 947.22
there and lava too

944.699 --> 950.12
but like those like destroy Boulders

947.22 --> 950.12
mostly

951.24 --> 955.38
like the acid doesn't destroy the

953.04 --> 959.2199999999999
Plastics

955.38 --> 961.019
and the lava doesn't destroy

959.22 --> 963.5400000000001
the steel

961.019 --> 965.88
in the stone boulders

963.54 --> 967.3199999999999
and so that's not much of an issue as to

965.88 --> 969.42
like what's happened like because as

967.32 --> 971.339
soon as the lava pours over it it's

969.42 --> 973.4399999999999
pretty much gone

971.339 --> 975.48
or or the acid

973.44 --> 978.6
right

975.48 --> 980.94
so it's much less of a hassle but if you

978.6 --> 984.24
introduce oil it's basically oh there's

980.94 --> 987.1800000000001
another water except this water will

984.24 --> 990.3
always like want to float on top of the

987.18 --> 991.92
other water and maybe it could be lit on

990.3 --> 993.8389999999999
fire or something like what the hell

991.92 --> 995.279
would that even mean there's no burning

993.839 --> 997.32
in this game

995.279 --> 1000.079
there's literally like

997.32 --> 1002.3000000000001
everything is just exploding

1000.079 --> 1004.899
there's no burning there's just being

1002.3 --> 1004.899
destroyed

1005.54 --> 1012.98
or yeah being caught in an explosion so

1009.86 --> 1016.66
it's like yeah it's oil it's just no

1012.98 --> 1016.66
it's too complicated

1017.0 --> 1023.86
right but I'm I'm full on working on it

1020.18 --> 1023.8599999999999
see my chat's filled up by now

1023.98 --> 1032.199
hello ev97 Oz Emma Peel dank good to see

1029.9 --> 1032.199
you all

1038.559 --> 1046.16
careful showing my work publicly uh

1042.86 --> 1048.02
they're not gonna get anything from a

1046.16 --> 1050.419
bunch of spreadsheets

1048.02 --> 1051.799
I'm pretty damn sure boom there's no

1050.419 --> 1054.44
Buller Dash

1051.799 --> 1056.78
Corporation or whatever it's like oh

1054.44 --> 1059.419
yeah oh we were looking on making a more

1056.78 --> 1061.46
expanded boulder dash they're not just

1059.419 --> 1063.5590000000002
gonna follow a guide

1061.46 --> 1065.96
online like if they would have done that

1063.559 --> 1068.6789999999999
they dude they would have done that 20

1065.96 --> 1068.679
years ago

1070.28 --> 1075.6789999999999
no no look you see the standard bull the

1073.58 --> 1077.6599999999999
dash as it has been happening I I

1075.679 --> 1079.64
understand the formula of it yeah

1077.66 --> 1081.919
they're not playing it for the

1079.64 --> 1084.3200000000002
Innovation they're not making those

1081.919 --> 1087.74
games for Innovation they're just making

1084.32 --> 1091.22
it for the pure Ebola Dash Nostalgia and

1087.74 --> 1093.44
they like to show new graphics

1091.22 --> 1095.919
that's what the ball the dash games have

1093.44 --> 1099.14
been doing okay that newest bullet Dash

1095.919 --> 1101.539
is almost identical to the old roller

1099.14 --> 1103.88
Dash except for the looks

1101.539 --> 1105.559
so

1103.88 --> 1107.179
as far as I know at least they haven't

1105.559 --> 1109.28
actually really changed the game

1107.179 --> 1111.26
mechanics because it was just such a

1109.28 --> 1113.72
solid system

1111.26 --> 1116.48
right and it is sold I mean it's solid

1113.72 --> 1118.22
enough that I'm using that system and

1116.48 --> 1121.039
expanding upon it

1118.22 --> 1123.98
like but I don't suspect any boulder

1121.039 --> 1126.5
dash producing get game producing

1123.98 --> 1130.16
company out there to be like oh yeah we

1126.5 --> 1133.48
were really looking to expand how this

1130.16 --> 1133.48
works no not really

1133.7 --> 1141.5
so I'm not really afraid of anybody

1137.0 --> 1143.72
trying to spy on me about this I mean

1141.5 --> 1146.419
they don't even want to start doing this

1143.72 --> 1150.98
because you know why because of putting

1146.419 --> 1154.039
it all together is such a huge task

1150.98 --> 1156.38
that most people just get a headache

1154.039 --> 1158.62
I mean this requires some serious nerd

1156.38 --> 1158.6200000000001
[ __ ]

1162.28 --> 1170.12
right and so most like no company would

1167.059 --> 1172.22
ever like oh we have paid workers let's

1170.12 --> 1174.559
make them make a more complicated bullet

1172.22 --> 1176.539
no because there would be no end in

1174.559 --> 1178.8799999999999
sight

1176.539 --> 1180.62
right for me it's different because I

1178.88 --> 1182.72
have a vision

1180.62 --> 1184.4599999999998
and I can basically do most of the

1182.72 --> 1186.559
designing on my own because I really

1184.46 --> 1189.02
understandable the Dash game

1186.559 --> 1191.539
like how it actually works

1189.02 --> 1193.94
I can like back engineer pull the dash

1191.539 --> 1196.76
on the spot without any information

1193.94 --> 1198.8600000000001
like literally without any reference

1196.76 --> 1201.14
I could just like from scratch on paper

1198.86 --> 1202.2199999999998
just write down exactly how roller Dash

1201.14 --> 1204.94
works

1202.22 --> 1204.94
exactly

1208.4 --> 1213.5
but yeah that's not going to be so easy

1210.2 --> 1217.78
with this one because this game is just

1213.5 --> 1217.78
so elaborate it's crazy

1223.4 --> 1226.0
anyway

1237.7 --> 1245.539
if I burn myself out with the idea of it

1243.02 --> 1248.179
well it's just like

1245.539 --> 1250.58
the enthusiasm leads to a lot of like

1248.179 --> 1252.5
new ideas like new Concepts and I'm

1250.58 --> 1255.4399999999998
immediately like throwing in between

1252.5 --> 1257.66
mostly machines right hey but sometimes

1255.44 --> 1259.16
I think of a thing like crystal wall

1257.66 --> 1263.559
which is

1259.16 --> 1263.559
was formerly known as magic wall

1266.72 --> 1270.98
right and I'm also seriously working

1269.179 --> 1272.48
like on the creatures in there because

1270.98 --> 1273.56
I'm like having

1272.48 --> 1274.88
it's like

1273.56 --> 1278.36
[Music]

1274.88 --> 1280.88
them just being hypnotic squares and

1278.36 --> 1281.8999999999999
Butterfly shapes is like not gonna cut

1280.88 --> 1284.179
it

1281.9 --> 1286.76
for a modern bull the dash game it was

1284.179 --> 1289.4
very useful and recognizable in the old

1286.76 --> 1291.799
games but it isn't just it's got to be

1289.4 --> 1294.799
something else

1291.799 --> 1296.96
so either like I don't even know like

1294.799 --> 1298.28
what direction to take that at like are

1296.96 --> 1301.94
they gonna be like

1298.28 --> 1304.039
the guard could be like a thug

1301.94 --> 1306.26
like a thug man

1304.039 --> 1308.059
right they can't dig they're just going

1306.26 --> 1310.28
through the air

1308.059 --> 1311.48
but yeah they don't really involve

1310.28 --> 1313.6399999999999
themselves or anything they don't even

1311.48 --> 1316.9
pick up diamonds well you'd expect a

1313.64 --> 1316.9
thug to pick up diamonds

1317.72 --> 1322.7
right and then you have the butterfly

1320.36 --> 1325.1
that explodes with diamonds what the

1322.7 --> 1327.679
hell would that be well I actually added

1325.1 --> 1329.84
an idea that I'm pretty damn sure isn't

1327.679 --> 1333.4
ever going to really happen

1329.84 --> 1338.059
and that is make it into a Grappler

1333.4 --> 1341.1200000000001
oh okay a literal like the grappler

1338.059 --> 1343.039
picture and he's just sitting there with

1341.12 --> 1345.9189999999999
with like diamonds in his hand and then

1343.039 --> 1350.0
when he explodes it's like oh no

1345.919 --> 1353.9
and he basically drops his money

1350.0 --> 1356.24
I mean that is a funny idea

1353.9 --> 1359.1200000000001
but I'm pretty sure there's like no

1356.24 --> 1363.76
corporate like there's like that would

1359.12 --> 1363.76
be like a big red flag

1365.24 --> 1368.96
I wish I could put a Grappler in the

1367.64 --> 1372.3400000000001
game

1368.96 --> 1372.3400000000001
that would be so funny

1372.679 --> 1378.22
just having like a whole bunch of gravel

1375.02 --> 1378.22
is sitting there walking around

1378.919 --> 1385.4
and you have to like throw rocks on them

1381.08 --> 1388.9399999999998
to like make them blow up in into gems

1385.4 --> 1391.419
I mean that is freaking funny guys

1388.94 --> 1391.419
right

1391.52 --> 1394.96
grabbler Dash

1412.22 --> 1415.22
foreign

1436.5 --> 1439.64
[Music]

1446.14 --> 1451.22
right so at least I'm thinking about

1448.82 --> 1453.6789999999999
that but I've already like kind of like

1451.22 --> 1456.38
defined the robots there's like a

1453.679 --> 1459.5
security robot and a digger robot a

1456.38 --> 1462.7600000000002
security robot is like

1459.5 --> 1462.76
pretty dangerous

1462.86 --> 1470.6589999999999
and like less like it can immune to

1467.78 --> 1473.299
laser for example and it conducts

1470.659 --> 1475.0390000000002
electricity so it can't be exploded that

1473.299 --> 1476.9
way either

1475.039 --> 1479.62
you can mostly just crush it with a

1476.9 --> 1479.6200000000001
boulder Crush

1480.32 --> 1484.82
so that's like a pretty tough thing

1483.08 --> 1486.32
although it moves in very specific

1484.82 --> 1487.82
patterns and then there's the Digger

1486.32 --> 1491.1399999999999
robot which is

1487.82 --> 1491.1399999999999
well it is vulnerable

1491.72 --> 1495.88
but it literally digs through dirt

1501.26 --> 1505.58
right

1502.84 --> 1508.1589999999999
also I thought of actually a really

1505.58 --> 1511.1
weird device I've thought of many weird

1508.159 --> 1512.7800000000002
devices but one device would be where

1511.1 --> 1515.299
you can literally like remote control

1512.78 --> 1517.52
like hack a robot

1515.299 --> 1520.34
like you have a thing then you basically

1517.52 --> 1523.039
choose a robot available and then you

1520.34 --> 1525.6789999999999
literally just

1523.039 --> 1528.2
gain control over that robot other

1525.679 --> 1530.72
robots won't respond

1528.2 --> 1533.38
but that way you could like use a remote

1530.72 --> 1533.38
digger

1533.48 --> 1536.8600000000001
to dig at a distance

1540.38 --> 1543.4
oh God

1544.64 --> 1547.72
thank you Richard

1549.44 --> 1555.5
a Netflix documentary about me

1553.279 --> 1558.34
wow

1555.5 --> 1558.34
amazing

1574.04 --> 1577.19
[Applause]

1580.4 --> 1585.44
right so yeah I think even like you

1583.46 --> 1586.279
could have their sort of magic in this

1585.44 --> 1588.26
game

1586.279 --> 1591.679
so maybe that could be like a ring of

1588.26 --> 1593.6
Mind Control in which you can

1591.679 --> 1596.179
control the creatures the regular

1593.6 --> 1598.58
creatures and then like a remote control

1596.179 --> 1601.52
or a hack

1598.58 --> 1605.5
hacking device

1601.52 --> 1605.5
that is specifically for robots

1620.919 --> 1627.76
right so yeah it just keeps coming man

1624.679 --> 1627.76
all these things

1639.38 --> 1644.2600000000002
yes clutch yeah that was definitely a

1642.14 --> 1644.26
troll

1644.72 --> 1648.38
although it's one of the more funny ones

1646.4 --> 1651.279
but I still don't allow them around I

1648.38 --> 1651.279
don't want that [ __ ]

1658.1 --> 1662.98
too many days of details of game

1664.279 --> 1670.159
oh oh I'm sorry

1667.94 --> 1675.1000000000001
oh people are bored about me talking

1670.159 --> 1675.1000000000001
about a game that I'm actually making oh

1677.36 --> 1682.36
then a

1679.4 --> 1682.3600000000001
Eevee

1683.24 --> 1688.58
hey if everybody just says oh good

1685.64 --> 1690.38
morning hello anyway this yeah that's

1688.58 --> 1693.26
not a subject then

1690.38 --> 1696.5800000000002
okay and I'm into this game right now so

1693.26 --> 1696.58
that's what's gonna come up

1697.4 --> 1702.919
mix it up a bit I'm sorry I just

1700.4 --> 1704.8400000000001
mentioned how I could how you could do

1702.919 --> 1708.0200000000002
relative density

1704.84 --> 1709.9399999999998
experiment in my bowler Dash game I

1708.02 --> 1712.46
thought that was like something worth

1709.94 --> 1715.059
making note of

1712.46 --> 1715.059
okay

1716.179 --> 1721.3400000000001
she's is this one of the days where

1718.1 --> 1724.12
nothing is good enough Evie

1721.34 --> 1724.12
gods

1724.34 --> 1730.84
and yes this I'm not I am a little

1727.4 --> 1730.8400000000001
cranky just for the record

1732.159 --> 1736.72
because I'm just not getting support

1736.94 --> 1744.64
that support I got is like five days ago

1740.96 --> 1744.64
it's really not good

1749.96 --> 1754.52
and that makes me cranky and it makes me

1752.059 --> 1757.82
like yeah you know what it actually does

1754.52 --> 1759.98
it makes me not want to do the show and

1757.82 --> 1761.96
just work on my game that's what it

1759.98 --> 1764.8600000000001
meant wants to make me do not getting

1761.96 --> 1764.8600000000001
support you see

1765.02 --> 1767.62
foreign

1772.72 --> 1776.2
first today

1787.76 --> 1792.1589999999999
right so hey what do you want to talk

1790.039 --> 1792.1589999999999
about

1795.559 --> 1800.299
yes viewers yeah but it has absolutely

1797.899 --> 1804.039
nothing to do with that am appeal

1800.299 --> 1804.039
there's something going on

1806.96 --> 1812.559
people don't tune out when I start

1809.12 --> 1812.559
talking about boulder dash

1812.779 --> 1817.22
that didn't happen the previous shows

1815.0 --> 1819.08
either okay

1817.22 --> 1820.34
and I checked them

1819.08 --> 1823.539
I get

1820.34 --> 1823.539
view checks

1830.539 --> 1836.299
So Yesterday shows already has

1834.14 --> 1839.419
all right from two days ago with boola

1836.299 --> 1842.299
Dash in the title 248.

1839.419 --> 1844.24
show before that also boulder dash in

1842.299 --> 1847.84
the title

1844.24 --> 1851.38
268 views the show before that

1847.84 --> 1851.3799999999999
282 views

1853.159 --> 1859.64
yeah oh by the way those are all more

1856.64 --> 1861.8600000000001
views than all the shows before that a

1859.64 --> 1864.0800000000002
week before that that all don't have

1861.86 --> 1866.899
both the dash in title

1864.08 --> 1868.52
oh and there want to help me make a

1866.899 --> 1871.52
Super Bowl a dash the first time I

1868.52 --> 1874.46
brought it up that one has 312 views

1871.52 --> 1877.52
Which is higher view count than all

1874.46 --> 1880.059
other shows that went after

1877.52 --> 1880.059
okay

1882.02 --> 1885.62
so incorrect

1887.6 --> 1891.74
we didn't even know what's so popular

1889.22 --> 1894.799
yeah well why do you think that Bola

1891.74 --> 1898.34
Dash game keeps getting republished

1894.799 --> 1899.6589999999999
like for 20 years straight sorry for 40

1898.34 --> 1902.059
years

1899.659 --> 1904.46
it's because it is popular it's a

1902.059 --> 1906.9189999999999
popular type of game it's did you know

1904.46 --> 1908.659
that it is basically its own genre out

1906.919 --> 1911.72
there

1908.659 --> 1913.88
like boulder dash games

1911.72 --> 1918.74
there's like other people that have like

1913.88 --> 1921.5590000000002
made silly boulder dash style mini games

1918.74 --> 1924.02
they call them bowler Dash games okay so

1921.559 --> 1927.5
that's how popular it is it's literally

1924.02 --> 1929.4189999999999
a game genre now out there although

1927.5 --> 1932.179
there is only the official original

1929.419 --> 1933.74
bully Dash but literally mini games out

1932.179 --> 1936.5590000000002
there all over the place that are

1933.74 --> 1939.34
classified as boulder dash games looking

1936.559 --> 1939.34
completely different

1939.38 --> 1943.64
all of them

1941.24 --> 1946.279
but that's how they work

1943.64 --> 1948.679
so

1946.279 --> 1954.82
live chat numbers are down though

1948.679 --> 1954.8200000000002
going down each day uh no not really

1959.659 --> 1967.7600000000002
you know live chat numbers go up

1962.419 --> 1971.1200000000001
when I get people on my show

1967.76 --> 1973.94
like the time when Darth Darth came on

1971.12 --> 1975.62
that really draws in people in chat that

1973.94 --> 1978.6200000000001
does happen

1975.62 --> 1980.7399999999998
like Retro Bill will show up and all

1978.62 --> 1983.059
that

1980.74 --> 1985.22
Godzilla will definitely show up

1983.059 --> 1987.34
although sometimes he still just shows

1985.22 --> 1987.34
up

1988.34 --> 1994.8799999999999
so getting people on with me on the show

1992.26 --> 1998.62
tends to basically draw in a lot more

1994.88 --> 1998.6200000000001
viewers and people in chat

1999.019 --> 2001.799
that's it

2003.159 --> 2006.2990000000002
hello blue Brian

2008.019 --> 2015.58
normally 30 uh Emma that's because

2012.399 --> 2018.279
the show is barely started

2015.58 --> 2020.5
I just I've been just going for like

2018.279 --> 2023.14
half an hour

2020.5 --> 2026.399
like the first half hour nobody's there

2023.14 --> 2026.3990000000001
it's always like that

2030.779 --> 2036.539
I only know the board game all the cash

2034.059 --> 2036.539
what

2037.659 --> 2044.5590000000002
okay that's not what it is and it's

2040.48 --> 2046.48
Bolder with the o u boulder dash is like

2044.559 --> 2049.799
this British expression

2046.48 --> 2049.799
of like nonsense

2050.919 --> 2054.5989999999997
it was a play on words

2057.7 --> 2064.98
like oh quickly Dash from the boulder

2061.96 --> 2064.98
that's falling down

2074.74 --> 2081.879
right well I'm appeal either that either

2078.099 --> 2084.159
you shut up or you actually

2081.879 --> 2085.54
talk about something like what should I

2084.159 --> 2088.119
talk about then

2085.54 --> 2090.58
right I'm pretty damn sure that talking

2088.119 --> 2094.7200000000003
about the stats

2090.58 --> 2097.7799999999997
is actually boring to everybody

2094.72 --> 2099.22
unless it's like explosive growth oh

2097.78 --> 2101.02
yeah then everybody's all super

2099.22 --> 2103.2999999999997
enthusiastic of course and goes

2101.02 --> 2105.52
ballistic but that's not the case so

2103.3 --> 2108.3390000000004
just talking about stats that's actually

2105.52 --> 2111.66
considered boring

2108.339 --> 2111.66
by pretty much everybody

2118.0 --> 2125.579
show is more interesting when I talk

2119.92 --> 2125.579
about philosophy or cosmology yeah sure

2125.68 --> 2128.64
what I mean

2128.8 --> 2134.8590000000004
what if I told you that this game is

2131.32 --> 2136.6600000000003
actually a micro cosmology right

2134.859 --> 2139.72
that's

2136.66 --> 2142.18
why it's so gripping I mean I'm

2139.72 --> 2147.1189999999997
literally like creating a micro Cosmos

2142.18 --> 2147.1189999999997
in a game with a physics engine dude

2148.119 --> 2153.82
and it's all based on check rules which

2151.06 --> 2156.04
is fascinating it's just check rules and

2153.82 --> 2157.42
that makes the physics like everything

2156.04 --> 2160.54
checks

2157.42 --> 2162.88
like everything has physics checks as to

2160.54 --> 2165.64
what's the conditions what's the

2162.88 --> 2168.2200000000003
conditions around you what is there oh

2165.64 --> 2172.359
is there a certain type of thing of

2168.22 --> 2174.7
of this well then you do that

2172.359 --> 2178.5989999999997
so there's like literal chemical

2174.7 --> 2180.9399999999996
reactions like material other materials

2178.599 --> 2183.339
next to it that don't that they this

2180.94 --> 2187.5
material doesn't like it's gonna explode

2183.339 --> 2190.54
right chemical reactions literal density

2187.5 --> 2194.5
displacement it's a physics engine man

2190.54 --> 2197.7
bull the dash is a physics engine

2194.5 --> 2202.74
in a really systematic

2197.7 --> 2207.339
grid type way so it's not like oh vector

2202.74 --> 2210.0989999999997
Vector grab like vector system and like

2207.339 --> 2214.24
Vector physics engine no no it's not not

2210.099 --> 2217.48
like it's literally a grid based physics

2214.24 --> 2220.9199999999996
engine which is really fascinating

2217.48 --> 2220.92
if you get that about it

2226.54 --> 2233.859
sounds promising be fun to Bro clutch

2230.74 --> 2235.859
you have no idea

2233.859 --> 2240.2799999999997
this game

2235.859 --> 2243.4
literally has infinite possibilities

2240.28 --> 2246.1600000000003
there's so much you can do with it it's

2243.4 --> 2249.64
absolutely crazy

2246.16 --> 2252.16
like all the different things all the

2249.64 --> 2256.5
different puzzles you can literally make

2252.16 --> 2256.5
a puzzle on just one freaking block

2258.7 --> 2264.5989999999997
but you can also have like eight or ten

2263.14 --> 2267.8799999999997
puzzles

2264.599 --> 2270.099
simultaneous of different sorts you can

2267.88 --> 2273.2200000000003
have like a switch puzzle

2270.099 --> 2275.56
combined with an electrode puzzle where

2273.22 --> 2277.7799999999997
it's like oh how do you like make the

2275.56 --> 2279.88
electrode destroy the path that I need

2277.78 --> 2282.52
to go through to the next level

2279.88 --> 2284.859
while not getting caught in it and then

2282.52 --> 2287.619
get destroyed and the switch puzzle in

2284.859 --> 2290.619
combination and like

2287.619 --> 2292.3
that's just one pretty straightforward

2290.619 --> 2294.52
puzzle idea

2292.3 --> 2297.6400000000003
there's just one freaking dude you can

2294.52 --> 2300.22
combine all of it you can put lasers in

2297.64 --> 2303.0989999999997
there barrier beams

2300.22 --> 2305.56
you can have like a complicated material

2303.099 --> 2308.4
puzzle where it's more about Boulders

2305.56 --> 2308.4
and fluids

2308.8 --> 2315.1600000000003
where it's like oh you have a lava your

2311.38 --> 2319.2000000000003
lava and water level like water or yeah

2315.16 --> 2319.2
water and lava reacts

2322.3 --> 2328.3
right but it can also pass through

2325.42 --> 2330.7000000000003
Boulders both of it except that the lava

2328.3 --> 2332.44
will destroy the boulders and the water

2330.7 --> 2334.8999999999996
will not destroy the balls it will just

2332.44 --> 2337.54
pass through it and also make certain

2334.9 --> 2340.06
types of material float

2337.54 --> 2344.02
get buoyant

2340.06 --> 2347.82
as they are as the water is in them

2344.02 --> 2347.82
so dude

2353.26 --> 2359.0200000000004
I mean like once it becomes a functional

2356.859 --> 2361.54
thing like once I get the construction

2359.02 --> 2365.02
kit in order where you can literally

2361.54 --> 2367.54
build a level and play the level

2365.02 --> 2369.94
my God

2367.54 --> 2371.74
I'm gonna literally well first off

2369.94 --> 2374.079
that's the point where I'm gonna start

2371.74 --> 2376.4799999999996
selling it that's when it's become an

2374.079 --> 2379.0600000000004
app and it's like yeah you can have the

2376.48 --> 2380.32
construction kit with the most basic

2379.06 --> 2382.54
graphics

2380.32 --> 2385.0
what a functioning all-around system

2382.54 --> 2386.619
where you can build levels and program

2385.0 --> 2389.74
levels

2386.619 --> 2393.339
connect to switches Etc set the rules

2389.74 --> 2396.8199999999997
and then have it as a standalone one

2393.339 --> 2400.839
level and then those levels will be

2396.82 --> 2403.54
hopefully sent in as a contest

2400.839 --> 2405.7
as a contest and I might even like have

2403.54 --> 2409.3
a sort of like an open system where it's

2405.7 --> 2410.56
like okay you create the levels

2409.3 --> 2413.619
and

2410.56 --> 2416.14
then we test the levels and then we

2413.619 --> 2419.38
judge like how good is it

2416.14 --> 2421.96
is this like a pretty basic just random

2419.38 --> 2425.32
level like an old-fashioned boulder dash

2421.96 --> 2427.3
or is it like a an interesting basic

2425.32 --> 2429.099
puzzle or is it this complicated puzzle

2427.3 --> 2430.9
and depending on like well it has to

2429.099 --> 2434.2000000000003
function of course

2430.9 --> 2437.079
so if it's a very serious puzzle it

2434.2 --> 2440.74
would be like it would be demanded that

2437.079 --> 2444.82
the maker actually shows how you are

2440.74 --> 2447.64
able to succeed the level of video

2444.82 --> 2450.2200000000003
demonstration so that we don't have to

2447.64 --> 2452.92
just figure it out if it's Mega complex

2450.22 --> 2455.56
like that we don't have to test whether

2452.92 --> 2457.9
it's actually complete and not broken

2455.56 --> 2459.52
you see

2457.9 --> 2462.579
so

2459.52 --> 2464.5
and then like yeah we could like even

2462.579 --> 2465.82
like get some sort of

2464.5 --> 2468.28
Exchange

2465.82 --> 2470.44
situation where it's like levels coming

2468.28 --> 2472.0600000000004
in that are then

2470.44 --> 2475.359
pay to play

2472.06 --> 2478.42
like they can literally like add

2475.359 --> 2480.52
bullet like other players or Outsiders

2478.42 --> 2483.94
can like make levels

2480.52 --> 2486.16
upload them like sort of sell them or

2483.94 --> 2488.92
rent them out

2486.16 --> 2492.0989999999997
and then the the game becomes available

2488.92 --> 2494.8
and in packages and when somebody buys a

2492.099 --> 2497.44
package then the maker gets a percentage

2494.8 --> 2499.48
of that if their level is in that

2497.44 --> 2502.619
package right

2499.48 --> 2505.2400000000002
and then eventually like popularity

2502.619 --> 2507.099
lists so people like wait which level

2505.24 --> 2510.16
did you think was the most awesome or

2507.099 --> 2513.04
which level would you actually replay

2510.16 --> 2515.3799999999997
like that sort of thing so that there's

2513.04 --> 2517.18
like a good sizing up also like what are

2515.38 --> 2519.339
the best levels which really are the

2517.18 --> 2521.859
best levels of every everybody

2519.339 --> 2524.859
for all the levels that were sent in

2521.859 --> 2527.98
and then better packages could be made

2524.859 --> 2530.14
and eventually like some of those people

2527.98 --> 2531.94
that made levels if especially if they

2530.14 --> 2536.2599999999998
make more they could even like hey you

2531.94 --> 2540.54
want to come basically work

2536.26 --> 2540.5400000000004
like actually just make levels

2542.38 --> 2547.0
because then it's like levels levels

2545.14 --> 2551.02
levels and then as soon as there are

2547.0 --> 2555.78
like 200 300 good

2551.02 --> 2555.78
working bulgar Dash levels available

2556.44 --> 2562.7200000000003
it's like endless fun

2560.32 --> 2566.38
and I could also definitely start

2562.72 --> 2569.56
working on multiple player games yeah

2566.38 --> 2574.38
but you probably haven't thought of that

2569.56 --> 2574.38
one yeah because that's very doable

2574.839 --> 2577.2599999999998
okay

2580.18 --> 2585.3999999999996
and with a puzzle game multiple player

2583.48 --> 2586.5
puzzle game yeah

2585.4 --> 2591.0
yeah

2586.5 --> 2591.0
that could be really interesting right

2591.52 --> 2594.88
where you have to like work together in

2593.5 --> 2597.16
the puzzle

2594.88 --> 2600.48
I mean that's freaking Epic

2597.16 --> 2600.48
so yeah I mean

2603.32 --> 2606.449
[Music]

2606.64 --> 2611.74
predict cash will come within fight wife

2609.22 --> 2613.9199999999996
within five days Evie what does that

2611.74 --> 2613.9199999999996
mean

2621.16 --> 2628.56
yeah what the [ __ ] are you talking about

2623.14 --> 2628.56
Evie am I manic about this

2633.819 --> 2639.4
am I just banking on the riches that are

2636.7 --> 2641.56
coming in am I just like well this is

2639.4 --> 2643.7200000000003
the final score no I'm literally just

2641.56 --> 2646.599
laying out like how I think it will

2643.72 --> 2648.9399999999996
happen and how I should do it I'm not

2646.599 --> 2652.1800000000003
getting manic about it

2648.94 --> 2654.4
I don't think like a game like this is

2652.18 --> 2657.339
not like is not going to set me for a

2654.4 --> 2659.2000000000003
life or anything okay I'm not an idiot

2657.339 --> 2661.96
it's just a game

2659.2 --> 2665.14
I just want it to be

2661.96 --> 2667.3
played I want the game to reach boola

2665.14 --> 2668.74
Dash fans that's what I really really

2667.3 --> 2672.819
want

2668.74 --> 2678.18
I I wanted that 20 years ago

2672.819 --> 2678.18
but it's gonna be now in this period

2680.02 --> 2686.8
why don't you just get a Minecraft

2682.18 --> 2689.7999999999997
because Minecraft sucks us

2686.8 --> 2692.44
it's a it's a game without rules it just

2689.8 --> 2695.5
sucks it's just a bunch of

2692.44 --> 2698.859
I mean it's just a it's just a 3D

2695.5 --> 2700.839
painting engine pretty much

2698.859 --> 2703.2999999999997
it's just a pixel painting engine but

2700.839 --> 2706.14
it's 3D and that's it it's not

2703.3 --> 2706.1400000000003
interesting at all

2706.78 --> 2711.46
I mean it can be kind of interesting to

2709.119 --> 2714.4
look at but it's not a game Minecraft

2711.46 --> 2717.04
isn't a game it's it's just a 3D

2714.4 --> 2719.38
painting module

2717.04 --> 2721.38
they're just painting stuff in 3D it

2719.38 --> 2726.52
doesn't really mean anything like

2721.38 --> 2729.48
crafting oh yeah sure real crafting

2726.52 --> 2729.48
nonsense

2730.66 --> 2736.68
that Minecraft doesn't have a phasing

2732.819 --> 2736.68
and physics engine it doesn't

2740.619 --> 2748.619
except like maybe the water and the lava

2743.38 --> 2748.619
in there sort of but I mean barely

2766.06 --> 2770.0789999999997
I don't know why Evie has to be like

2767.98 --> 2772.48
this by the way like why are you

2770.079 --> 2774.6400000000003
freaking damping my flame I literally

2772.48 --> 2777.04
stuck up for you this is the first time

2774.64 --> 2781.56
in like a long time that I'm actually

2777.04 --> 2781.56
getting back to like a a game project

2782.98 --> 2788.079
what do you think this is just me

2785.8 --> 2790.6600000000003
[ __ ] around again this is not like oh

2788.079 --> 2793.599
I got a really good idea for the Matrix

2790.66 --> 2796.0
movie script yeah because that one is

2793.599 --> 2797.619
very not gonna happen of course

2796.0 --> 2800.44
mostly

2797.619 --> 2803.1400000000003
unless somebody's like oh we saw that

2800.44 --> 2805.599
you had an idea there and like to hear

2803.14 --> 2809.859
it right

2805.599 --> 2813.46
yeah the game however is different like

2809.859 --> 2817.2999999999997
this thing is is there like it's already

2813.46 --> 2818.25
done mostly it just has to be put into a

2817.3 --> 2821.32
program format

2818.25 --> 2821.32
[Applause]

2824.26 --> 2828.0600000000004
yeah I know she's gone I'm appeal

2828.339 --> 2834.599
low fiber oats

2830.579 --> 2834.599
metal slugs cockatiel

2834.76 --> 2842.4
Dr utker

2837.819 --> 2842.4
see plenty of people in the chat now

2854.04 --> 2859.0
okay Emma Peel so what of what she said

2857.02 --> 2863.339
made sense could you tell me what

2859.0 --> 2863.339
exactly of what Evie said made sense

2864.22 --> 2871.0
you think it makes sense that

2867.18 --> 2873.7
oh my mania about the game is gonna

2871.0 --> 2876.22
crash and I'm gonna forget all about it

2873.7 --> 2878.52
you think that that's that that makes

2876.22 --> 2878.52
sense

2921.88 --> 2923.94
oh

2926.079 --> 2931.1800000000003
you can talk about it not talk about it

2928.24 --> 2933.04
whatever I'm just glad that today the

2931.18 --> 2934.48
YouTube isn't freaking glitching out on

2933.04 --> 2936.88
me

2934.48 --> 2940.859
that the camera is just normal camera

2936.88 --> 2940.859
without freezing all the time

2950.52 --> 2954.24
tempering my enthusiasm

2961.359 --> 2963.9
right

2968.8 --> 2974.76
well I don't really need to temper it

2972.28 --> 2974.76
though

2975.099 --> 2979.839
it's not like I'm like sick of the

2977.56 --> 2980.98
enthusiasm like I'm literally like oh

2979.839 --> 2983.56
it's

2980.98 --> 2986.02
it's driving me crazy how much I want it

2983.56 --> 2990.5789999999997
now that's not happening it's just like

2986.02 --> 2993.22
oh it's actually the time to do this now

2990.579 --> 2995.5600000000004
it's it's more about me deciding like

2993.22 --> 2998.2599999999998
yeah I'm actually going to program now

2995.56 --> 3001.2
I'm I'm done with this [ __ ] world I

2998.26 --> 3003.0
cannot rely on anybody else anymore for

3001.2 --> 3005.2799999999997
that [ __ ]

3003.0 --> 3008.28
all the programmers in the world and

3005.28 --> 3011.2400000000002
none of them will ever [ __ ] help me

3008.28 --> 3011.2400000000002
with this [ __ ]

3012.56 --> 3019.44
like they did for a little and then they

3016.98 --> 3021.54
weren't interested anymore and they were

3019.44 --> 3024.2400000000002
just like staring at like how much work

3021.54 --> 3026.16
it would be and then they didn't want to

3024.24 --> 3029.4599999999996
do it anymore because they weren't just

3026.16 --> 3032.0
getting paid for it per hour

3029.46 --> 3032.0
yeah

3032.28 --> 3038.94
and thus well maybe then I'll just have

3036.48 --> 3042.0
to program I'll just have to learn to

3038.94 --> 3045.619
program just to actually do it so this

3042.0 --> 3049.46
is all preparation work to me actually

3045.619 --> 3049.46
programming it myself

3049.559 --> 3054.7200000000003
this not something that's gonna just

3052.14 --> 3056.7599999999998
like fizzle I'm gonna do it because I'm

3054.72 --> 3058.98
[ __ ] sick

3056.76 --> 3061.6800000000003
I'm sick of

3058.98 --> 3063.3
of it literally not manifesting when

3061.68 --> 3064.98
it's like one of the best game ideas

3063.3 --> 3068.9
that I've ever seen

3064.98 --> 3068.9
like in total

3074.9 --> 3081.859
no I know she didn't mean harm em appeal

3078.3 --> 3081.8590000000004
that's not I'm not suggesting that

3082.92 --> 3085.92
foreign

3103.22 --> 3109.7599999999998
clutch use people's doubt as fuel to

3106.98 --> 3109.76
motivate you

3123.119 --> 3125.839
what

3127.44 --> 3131.96
are you talking English right now clutch

3138.24 --> 3144.4199999999996
okay I guess I just don't understand

3140.579 --> 3146.7000000000003
what you're exactly saying but yeah I

3144.42 --> 3148.079
mean I am determined if that's what you

3146.7 --> 3150.54
were pointing at I'm definitely

3148.079 --> 3152.76
determined like this dude I've been

3150.54 --> 3155.64
sitting on it for 20 years I'm [ __ ]

3152.76 --> 3157.619
done I'm not gonna [ __ ] die with a

3155.64 --> 3159.72
bunch of sketches that were never made

3157.619 --> 3162.9
into a game okay it's not gonna [ __ ]

3159.72 --> 3164.52
happen I'm gonna have a [ __ ] game

3162.9 --> 3166.079
under my name

3164.52 --> 3169.14
yeah

3166.079 --> 3171.7200000000003
I want to have produced something in

3169.14 --> 3173.2799999999997
this [ __ ] world that's like tagged to

3171.72 --> 3177.24
my name

3173.28 --> 3179.88
so that I just won't just be regarded as

3177.24 --> 3183.3799999999997
a useless piece of [ __ ] that happens to

3179.88 --> 3183.38
talk about Flat Earth or something

3185.04 --> 3190.68
or does YouTube and like oh well that's

3188.4 --> 3193.38
special I mean literally half of YouTube

3190.68 --> 3196.44
is filled with complete [ __ ] that can

3193.38 --> 3198.599
barely even talk and they get 10 times

3196.44 --> 3200.099
the money income that I do from that

3198.599 --> 3204.38
[ __ ]

3200.099 --> 3204.38
yeah I'm so [ __ ] done with that

3206.66 --> 3212.819
like even saying that I'm a YouTuber

3210.48 --> 3214.2
like professionally you know what that

3212.819 --> 3218.7
does to people

3214.2 --> 3222.359
it makes them think you're a [ __ ]

3218.7 --> 3225.1189999999997
because the average person that does

3222.359 --> 3228.38
stuff on YouTube all the time are

3225.119 --> 3228.38
[ __ ] retards

3229.16 --> 3234.8999999999996
blabbermouthing idiots

3232.44 --> 3237.96
that are barely cohesive

3234.9 --> 3240.9
so just saying I do YouTube

3237.96 --> 3243.0
it really is not what you think it is

3240.9 --> 3246.98
it's not like oh wow

3243.0 --> 3246.98
now that means oh okay

3247.14 --> 3250.68
you're Pro you could be a complete idiot

3249.72 --> 3253.8799999999997
then

3250.68 --> 3253.8799999999997
that's what that means

3263.099 --> 3267.54
yeah it's not gonna burn out before

3265.44 --> 3271.819
completion I have the freaking

3267.54 --> 3271.819
schematics from 20 years ago

3274.339 --> 3279.54
and it's a multiple stage thing anyway

3277.02 --> 3281.22
it's not like oh it's all I'll just

3279.54 --> 3283.14
start programming it's going to be like

3281.22 --> 3286.6189999999997
the easiest thing in the world for me no

3283.14 --> 3289.6189999999997
it's gonna be a massive threshold that's

3286.619 --> 3292.2000000000003
gonna physically hurt to get into that

3289.619 --> 3294.6600000000003
like the amount of strain and ego

3292.2 --> 3297.66
resistance that's gonna like be unleash

3294.66 --> 3300.2999999999997
on me is not gonna be nice

3297.66 --> 3303.1189999999997
the point is I don't see another way and

3300.3 --> 3305.48
I finally built up the confidence

3303.119 --> 3308.7000000000003
to think yeah

3305.48 --> 3311.22
I think that I can actually do it now

3308.7 --> 3313.3799999999997
that's the difference

3311.22 --> 3314.7599999999998
I thought I've always thought I can't do

3313.38 --> 3317.339
this

3314.76 --> 3320.1600000000003
which in retrospect is [ __ ] insane

3317.339 --> 3324.24
because I should have just like [ __ ] you

3320.16 --> 3326.5789999999997
Arwin just start programming nobody

3324.24 --> 3330.2999999999997
gives a [ __ ] about your [ __ ]

3326.579 --> 3331.619
insecurities just [ __ ] do it just

3330.3 --> 3336.059
start

3331.619 --> 3340.2200000000003
typing [ __ ] that does stuff just [ __ ]

3336.059 --> 3340.2200000000003
do it I should have just [ __ ] done it

3341.28 --> 3346.7400000000002
but I didn't and now I will I am just

3344.46 --> 3349.4
gonna [ __ ] do that because nobody

3346.74 --> 3349.3999999999996
else will

3351.839 --> 3357.839
nobody's gonna report themselves like

3354.42 --> 3360.359
hey I got a spare thousand hours I'd

3357.839 --> 3362.4
love to use that to program a really

3360.359 --> 3365.819
cool video game with it you got any

3362.4 --> 3367.5
ideas yeah those people aren't around so

3365.819 --> 3369.7799999999997
I'm gonna have to [ __ ] do it myself

3367.5 --> 3372.66
from scratch

3369.78 --> 3374.8190000000004
because no person in the [ __ ] world

3372.66 --> 3378.02
is gonna help me with this [ __ ]

3374.819 --> 3378.02
they don't care

3383.579 --> 3385.7000000000003
thank you

3386.78 --> 3391.44
do I have a programmer no I don't have a

3390.18 --> 3393.8999999999996
programmer

3391.44 --> 3396.359
and nobody is going to be a programmer

3393.9 --> 3399.3
for me yeah because I'm not gonna pay

3396.359 --> 3402.24
you surprise surprise

3399.3 --> 3404.28
and no [ __ ] programmer ever programs

3402.24 --> 3406.319
anything without getting paid for it

3404.28 --> 3409.2000000000003
because when they don't get paid for it

3406.319 --> 3412.319
they lose their [ __ ] attention and

3409.2 --> 3416.66
then they stop doing it yeah that's what

3412.319 --> 3416.66
happens I'm done with that [ __ ]

3423.839 --> 3426.74
thank you

3453.48 --> 3460.559
yeah so don't I don't need any advice on

3457.319 --> 3463.74
how to manage my feelings about this

3460.559 --> 3465.9
yeah you don't have to like worry

3463.74 --> 3468.72
it's like it's not even any of your

3465.9 --> 3470.46
business really like oh oh don't get too

3468.72 --> 3472.98
enthusiastic or you'll lose it again

3470.46 --> 3476.339
what do you think I'm just some helpless

3472.98 --> 3477.72
manic depressive person that has no

3476.339 --> 3479.5789999999997
controlling over their feelings

3477.72 --> 3481.5
whatsoever

3479.579 --> 3484.76
no

3481.5 --> 3484.76
no I'm not that

3485.339 --> 3490.44
yeah I don't have wild feeling swings

3488.88 --> 3491.819
like that

3490.44 --> 3495.059
I have

3491.819 --> 3499.339
days where I get a bit more agitated and

3495.059 --> 3499.3390000000004
days where I'm like really happy

3499.619 --> 3504.7200000000003
but that's not manic depression

3502.559 --> 3510.26
that's not what that is

3504.72 --> 3510.2599999999998
it's weather sensitivity it doesn't last

3511.44 --> 3516.599
it's not like boom and then it's stuck

3514.5 --> 3518.339
on the inside and it stays there and it

3516.599 --> 3520.8590000000004
stays there when I'm offline it stays

3518.339 --> 3522.54
there when I try to sleep no it's not

3520.859 --> 3524.22
that's not where that's taking place

3522.54 --> 3526.579
it's not where there's energy is taking

3524.22 --> 3526.5789999999997
place

3527.46 --> 3532.64
my emotions are not all just like manic

3531.359 --> 3535.5
depression

3532.64 --> 3537.359
responses okay that's not why I'm

3535.5 --> 3540.559
showing emotion I'm showing emotions

3537.359 --> 3546.2599999999998
because I [ __ ] choose to do that

3540.559 --> 3546.26
I choose to show you how I feel

3547.14 --> 3555.42
I choose that actively and I can

3551.48 --> 3559.26
deactivate that and not show any feeling

3555.42 --> 3562.88
too yeah I have that option to do that

3559.26 --> 3562.88
because I have control

3564.0 --> 3570.24
it's just once I get into a rage spiral

3567.359 --> 3573.119
then I don't have full control until

3570.24 --> 3576.4199999999996
it's die down again and that's the only

3573.119 --> 3579.0
way in which I don't have full 100

3576.42 --> 3583.02
control yeah

3579.0 --> 3584.16
that's how it is I have control over

3583.02 --> 3587.0
myself

3584.16 --> 3587.0
yes

3587.76 --> 3595.8590000000004
once get into an anger fit then it kind

3592.559 --> 3599.78
of has to burn out

3595.859 --> 3599.7799999999997
and then I got it back under control

3608.94 --> 3612.98
yeah blue pill Devolution whatever

3613.5 --> 3622.04
she's not a stupid hostile evil

3617.66 --> 3622.04
infiltrator we don't have those

3626.22 --> 3630.72
people don't even take the effort to do

3628.68 --> 3634.2599999999998
that [ __ ] okay

3630.72 --> 3637.3799999999997
trolls just show up and just act like

3634.26 --> 3641.099
[ __ ] that's what trolls do nobody

3637.38 --> 3643.1400000000003
comes here to infiltrate and globers

3641.099 --> 3645.96
anti-flatter they're not even [ __ ]

3643.14 --> 3648.48
interested in me that like that why

3645.96 --> 3650.78
because I don't talk about Flat Earth

3648.48 --> 3650.78
enough

3652.5 --> 3657.2
will I learn to program it yeah

3674.94 --> 3680.28
it's a giant pile of if routines anyway

3678.059 --> 3683.119
so it should be technically really

3680.28 --> 3683.119
simple to program

3689.7 --> 3694.6189999999997
are you supportive yeah well blue build

3691.92 --> 3696.96
Evolution you complaining about is not

3694.619 --> 3699.059
supportive either yeah you know what's

3696.96 --> 3702.5
supportive sending me money on the

3699.059 --> 3702.5
PayPal that's supportive

3704.48 --> 3708.319
blabbering doesn't matter

3716.36 --> 3719.53
[Music]

3727.319 --> 3732.66
she had an idea and like hey whatever

3730.5 --> 3735.599
it's just a bad timing I don't really

3732.66 --> 3739.02
care I don't need any tips

3735.599 --> 3742.319
it's like I'm not afraid to like oh I'm

3739.02 --> 3745.5
losing my inspiration dude this stuff

3742.319 --> 3747.299
has was there for 20 years you think

3745.5 --> 3749.579
it's just gonna like

3747.299 --> 3752.46
go away

3749.579 --> 3754.2000000000003
no I wanted that game made and I still

3752.46 --> 3757.619
want that game made and now I want it

3754.2 --> 3760.2599999999998
even more because I got more details

3757.619 --> 3764.04
it's more pronounced now it's more

3760.26 --> 3766.92
detailed it's more promising

3764.04 --> 3768.839
and the technology out there will make

3766.92 --> 3773.64
it easier

3768.839 --> 3776.5789999999997
will guarantee it to work even more

3773.64 --> 3779.5789999999997
will be no slow down issues whatsoever

3776.579 --> 3784.079
which were an issue at that time 20

3779.579 --> 3787.2200000000003
years ago that was a dilemma back then

3784.079 --> 3787.2200000000003
now it isn't

3789.66 --> 3794.46
they'll shut you down if my furnished

3792.059 --> 3797.2400000000002
product gets notoriety how the hell

3794.46 --> 3797.2400000000002
would they do that

3797.4 --> 3802.38
how the hell could you shut that down

3800.099 --> 3805.579
unless I had some copyright or whatever

3802.38 --> 3805.579
which I won't

3809.94 --> 3816.059
because I really kind of want it to be a

3813.24 --> 3820.6189999999997
baller Dash game and once I pay for that

3816.059 --> 3824.3390000000004
copy right they will not do anything to

3820.619 --> 3826.619
me because now it's their product too

3824.339 --> 3830.22
they're not gonna shut it down why the

3826.619 --> 3832.7000000000003
[ __ ] would they shut down Buddha Dash

3830.22 --> 3832.7
right

3832.799 --> 3835.7
but even

3835.859 --> 3840.48
like so what if it gets notoriety you

3839.16 --> 3842.0989999999997
know what will happen there are just a

3840.48 --> 3845.88
lot of people that will come to me and

3842.099 --> 3849.0
try to like make deals and like oh

3845.88 --> 3850.6800000000003
sell it to us just a bunch of people

3849.0 --> 3853.02
that will just like try to want to sell

3850.68 --> 3855.7799999999997
it to us or they'll try to copy it and

3853.02 --> 3858.66
make a gigantic mess out of it

3855.78 --> 3860.94
they will make a [ __ ] mess out of it

3858.66 --> 3863.2799999999997
if they do that I mean [ __ ] good luck

3860.94 --> 3866.28
dude trying to copy this

3863.28 --> 3868.5
good luck with that you're gonna mess it

3866.28 --> 3871.98
up big time

3868.5 --> 3873.119
it's way too complicated to just copy

3871.98 --> 3875.7
like that

3873.119 --> 3877.1400000000003
this is not an easily back engineerable

3875.7 --> 3881.7599999999998
game

3877.14 --> 3885.5
old bullet Ash was but this one no

3881.76 --> 3890.2200000000003
it's way too elaborate

3885.5 --> 3892.319
it will chase me if I they think I am

3890.22 --> 3894.5989999999997
copying anything

3892.319 --> 3896.819
copying what

3894.599 --> 3900.2000000000003
chase me about what what the [ __ ] are

3896.819 --> 3900.2
you talking about Ben Arthur

3909.92 --> 3914.28
yeah I'm appeal I know that I had to

3913.079 --> 3916.319
defend her

3914.28 --> 3918.3590000000004
out there because she gets herself into

3916.319 --> 3920.66
trouble she's just a girl that just

3918.359 --> 3920.66
makes

3920.72 --> 3925.6189999999997
other people angry and then she doesn't

3923.579 --> 3930.0
back down

3925.619 --> 3932.2200000000003
that's kind of her problem is that

3930.0 --> 3934.73
she doesn't back down when she pisses

3932.22 --> 3937.7889999999998
off when other people get annoyed

3934.73 --> 3937.789
[Music]

3946.619 --> 3952.1400000000003
so yeah it's all very nice Ben Arthur oh

3949.98 --> 3955.14
little cheers thanks thanks for the

3952.14 --> 3959.04
whole the [ __ ] useless paranoia

3955.14 --> 3962.22
but nobody's gonna chase anybody

3959.04 --> 3964.319
yeah I mean are they chasing David Weiss

3962.22 --> 3968.3999999999996
for his successful

3964.319 --> 3971.2799999999997
Flat Earth zodiac whatever app

3968.4 --> 3974.28
because it is pretty successful are they

3971.28 --> 3975.5400000000004
chasing after him

3974.28 --> 3978.26
yeah

3975.54 --> 3978.2599999999998
are they

3979.079 --> 3985.38
so what are you going to base that on

3982.079 --> 3989.2400000000002
Ben Arthur what are you gonna base it on

3985.38 --> 3989.2400000000002
that they're gonna chase after me

3996.29 --> 3999.44
[Music]

4027.5 --> 4034.24
or say it's based on a previous game

4030.38 --> 4034.2400000000002
yeah no [ __ ] Sherlock

4037.46 --> 4045.46
and I already said

4040.299 --> 4051.4
I want to get the

4045.46 --> 4051.4
copyrights of that game for this

4059.359 --> 4063.92
permission might not be given oh well

4062.059 --> 4065.48
okay in that case if they don't give me

4063.92 --> 4067.16
permission then I will call it something

4065.48 --> 4069.799
else and then there's not a [ __ ]

4067.16 --> 4072.5
thing they can do about it not a [ __ ]

4069.799 --> 4074.559
thing there's literally thousands of

4072.5 --> 4078.859
bullet Dash clone games out there

4074.559 --> 4082.1600000000003
there's nothing they can do about it

4078.859 --> 4085.2799999999997
besides it's so [ __ ] elaborate the

4082.16 --> 4088.7599999999998
original game content is like

4085.28 --> 4090.98
five percent of the total you would

4088.76 --> 4093.44
barely even be able to cross reference

4090.98 --> 4094.22
this game with the old Lula dash at that

4093.44 --> 4096.199
point

4094.22 --> 4098.12
I'm just gonna call it something else

4096.199 --> 4100.419999999999
then I got plenty of names that I could

4098.12 --> 4100.42
give it

4101.299 --> 4109.299
like so I'm not I'm not really uh

4106.219 --> 4109.299
worried about anything

4117.199 --> 4121.639999999999
that will get the copyright people

4119.179 --> 4124.52
interested

4121.64 --> 4126.7390000000005
I just want to be able I want it to be

4124.52 --> 4129.759
part of the franchise I want it to get

4126.739 --> 4129.759
official recognition

4135.679 --> 4140.96
that is all right because I don't want

4137.9 --> 4143.719
to like outshine the old bulldash

4140.96 --> 4147.199
and then not make it build a dash

4143.719 --> 4148.88
I'd feel like I'd be parasiting on the

4147.199 --> 4151.759
thing that inspired me I don't want to

4148.88 --> 4155.0
do that I wanted this to be a bull the

4151.759 --> 4158.859
dash game I always wanted that talk to

4155.0 --> 4158.859
Nintendo [ __ ]

4159.02 --> 4162.160000000001
what are you talking about

4163.1 --> 4167.2390000000005
it's not going to be a console game

4165.56 --> 4170.120000000001
exclusive

4167.239 --> 4173.12
okay I mean sure I'll give it four

4170.12 --> 4176.299
consoles availability sure that would be

4173.12 --> 4180.3189999999995
cool if they're interested but uh I was

4176.299 --> 4182.179
mostly thinking of just a very basic

4180.319 --> 4186.859
PC

4182.179 --> 4190.06
and or apple oriented app game that you

4186.859 --> 4190.06
could even play on your mobile

4196.82 --> 4200.44
that's what I was thinking of

4202.239 --> 4208.58
but I am how about I'm not gonna talk up

4205.88 --> 4211.1
to anybody about anything until I

4208.58 --> 4214.84
actually have a product

4211.1 --> 4214.84
until it's a working thing

4224.719 --> 4227.26
right

4242.12 --> 4248.0199999999995
will you when will you have a word

4244.76 --> 4248.02
that's hilarious gun

4248.84 --> 4256.82
when we'll have a working demo well

4253.1 --> 4260.179
when I've learned how to program it and

4256.82 --> 4262.46
can actually make a level

4260.179 --> 4264.9800000000005
with it

4262.46 --> 4267.08
that's like playable I mean that's gonna

4264.98 --> 4269.36
take a freaking while it's gonna be well

4267.08 --> 4271.34
underway

4269.36 --> 4273.98
like by the time I'm gonna be able to

4271.34 --> 4277.58
make a demo of it I'm probably going to

4273.98 --> 4281.44
have like other hopefully

4277.58 --> 4281.44
guys working with me

4284.78 --> 4288.4
or at least advise me

4297.92 --> 4301.159
it would be like you're trying to make

4299.719 --> 4304.3
an official Star Wars sequel without

4301.159 --> 4304.299999999999
Disney getting involved

4304.6 --> 4309.9800000000005
well that will be now what in the past

4307.64 --> 4313.06
there's been plenty of Star Wars games

4309.98 --> 4313.0599999999995
that were not

4316.1 --> 4323.38
like I don't know

4318.64 --> 4323.38
out with a hole on that one

4325.76 --> 4333.4400000000005
help Cool Tech what help test it that's

4330.62 --> 4336.88
that's nice offer low fruit but it

4333.44 --> 4336.879999999999
mostly won't be necessary

4352.96 --> 4361.06
what do you mean are you saying Nintendo

4357.02 --> 4361.06
owns boulder dash or something

4365.54 --> 4368.679
what are you saying

4373.82 --> 4380.139999999999
yeah that's what I thought

4375.86 --> 4380.139999999999
BBG again entertainment right

4383.659 --> 4388.599999999999
owns the IP what are you talking about

4400.699 --> 4405.44
right but yeah dude

4403.28 --> 4407.239
I'll just stop talking about it then I

4405.44 --> 4409.639999999999
guess because

4407.239 --> 4411.919999999999
I won't be able to give you any

4409.64 --> 4415.780000000001
demonstration anytime soon and I'm

4411.92 --> 4415.78
talking like at least within a year

4416.9 --> 4421.699
I doubt it

4419.48 --> 4423.139999999999
and there's also a good chance that once

4421.699 --> 4425.299999999999
I got this round and out I'll

4423.14 --> 4427.6990000000005
discontinue that the programming just

4425.3 --> 4429.4400000000005
becomes too much of an obstacle

4427.699 --> 4431.299999999999
yeah

4429.44 --> 4433.219
there's a good chance that that will

4431.3 --> 4435.1990000000005
happen by that time but hey at least I

4433.219 --> 4439.1
will have a massively updated and

4435.199 --> 4441.699
complete Builder Dash framework system

4439.1 --> 4441.6990000000005
foreign

4442.219 --> 4447.08
right then maybe indeed I could seek out

4444.92 --> 4449.32
a young programmer like hey you want a

4447.08 --> 4449.32
challenge

4465.679 --> 4468.679
right

4472.76 --> 4478.34
but however you're gonna Bend and twist

4475.52 --> 4479.96
it there is going to be a problem there

4478.34 --> 4483.02
because

4479.96 --> 4486.08
I am going to need finances and I'm

4483.02 --> 4488.06
talking about way more than I have

4486.08 --> 4490.78
available or that I would ever get from

4488.06 --> 4493.64
you guys from your support or anything

4490.78 --> 4495.98
being able to actually pay a programmer

4493.64 --> 4498.56
is really [ __ ] expensive I don't have

4495.98 --> 4501.4
the money I don't I don't know how to

4498.56 --> 4501.400000000001
get such money

4501.62 --> 4508.04
right other than going to a bank and

4504.679 --> 4510.08
then probably not getting it

4508.04 --> 4514.84
not getting that loan

4510.08 --> 4514.84
or getting it massively predatorily

4533.8 --> 4538.179
Dragon's Den what the hell is that

4538.52 --> 4542.4400000000005
I don't know what you guys are talking

4540.199 --> 4542.44
about

4558.44 --> 4561.44
what

4561.8 --> 4567.9800000000005
okay no fruit

4565.1 --> 4569.360000000001
really they sponsor you for programmer

4567.98 --> 4571.4
money

4569.36 --> 4573.739
and wouldn't it just wouldn't that be

4571.4 --> 4577.54
just basically be selling the product to

4573.739 --> 4577.54
them that they own it now

4592.64 --> 4595.12
okay

4608.56 --> 4614.620000000001
dude I don't even know what you guys are

4611.48 --> 4614.62
talking about at this point

4622.9 --> 4628.58
but I mean dude I've been thinking that

4625.76 --> 4630.26
maybe when I really got this thing done

4628.58 --> 4632.3
I'm gonna like

4630.26 --> 4635.42
see contact with my brother or something

4632.3 --> 4635.75
see maybe he would be like willing to do

4635.42 --> 4638.06
it

4635.75 --> 4641.36
[Music]

4638.06 --> 4643.64
right maybe he's like

4641.36 --> 4645.679
I don't know it would be kind of cool

4643.64 --> 4647.659000000001
because then it could be like a family

4645.679 --> 4651.02
thing but

4647.659 --> 4653.299999999999
he didn't have even remotely enough time

4651.02 --> 4654.7390000000005
back then now he has kids and all that

4653.3 --> 4657.7390000000005
now they're probably like around

4654.739 --> 4660.5599999999995
teenagers and all that so

4657.739 --> 4662.959999999999
it won't require continuous attention

4660.56 --> 4665.06
anymore

4662.96 --> 4667.179
but uh

4665.06 --> 4667.179
thank you

4672.56 --> 4675.34
all right

4723.34 --> 4729.38
well maybe blue pill that I mean

4726.98 --> 4731.299999999999
I don't know

4729.38 --> 4732.9800000000005
I don't think he knows a lot of

4731.3 --> 4734.4800000000005
programmers

4732.98 --> 4737.178999999999
like

4734.48 --> 4739.82
it was very solitary in that scene and

4737.179 --> 4743.179
he didn't like he stepped out of it he

4739.82 --> 4745.159
like programming drove him nuts

4743.179 --> 4748.2390000000005
because of freaking management always

4745.159 --> 4748.239
[ __ ] everything up

4751.64 --> 4756.9800000000005
so he kind of like abandoned it as a

4754.64 --> 4759.8
profession and now he like designs

4756.98 --> 4762.799999999999
puzzles he has like a a puzzle designing

4759.8 --> 4764.2390000000005
company that's his thing now

4762.8 --> 4766.9400000000005
it's kind of funny though because bull

4764.239 --> 4768.678999999999
the dash is a puzzle game

4766.94 --> 4770.659
but I I

4768.679 --> 4774.08
don't know

4770.659 --> 4777.58
I haven't contacted my brother in

4774.08 --> 4777.58
half a decade or more

4782.719 --> 4787.1
maybe we could talk about something else

4784.82 --> 4788.719
at this point okay it's just like I

4787.1 --> 4791.4800000000005
don't want to talk about the freaking

4788.719 --> 4793.88
aftermath [ __ ] of boulder dash I'm I

4791.48 --> 4796.218999999999
still dude I'm still in the design phase

4793.88 --> 4798.7390000000005
I don't want to like I don't want to

4796.219 --> 4802.52
make like the arrangements for the

4798.739 --> 4804.98
parking spaces of the reveal like dude

4802.52 --> 4807.8
[ __ ] off with all that [ __ ] I don't want

4804.98 --> 4810.5
to have anything to do with that it's

4807.8 --> 4813.14
[ __ ] pointless Imagining the entire

4810.5 --> 4815.659
thing happening when I'm not even

4813.14 --> 4818.179
remotely there yet

4815.659 --> 4820.94
I don't want to do that that [ __ ]

4818.179 --> 4823.82
Burns me out

4820.94 --> 4826.219
I don't want to [ __ ] dream about some

4823.82 --> 4827.389999999999
finished product when it isn't a

4826.219 --> 4830.449
finished product

4827.39 --> 4830.4490000000005
[Music]

4836.06 --> 4844.219
I mostly need somebody that can help me

4839.06 --> 4846.38
create the framework for the engine of

4844.219 --> 4850.04
it

4846.38 --> 4853.84
so that there is a running engine that

4850.04 --> 4853.84
reads from a chart

4854.02 --> 4861.320000000001
makes changes accordingly on the chart

4858.92 --> 4864.14
and then re-reads the chart and does it

4861.32 --> 4866.84
over again and that is the game like I

4864.14 --> 4869.179
have to have that engine work

4866.84 --> 4871.52
and be dynamic

4869.179 --> 4874.1
and then once that happens then I can

4871.52 --> 4875.84
literally like start well coding

4874.1 --> 4877.280000000001
instructions

4875.84 --> 4880.46
and then

4877.28 --> 4882.86
taking the entire library of all

4880.46 --> 4884.36
possible combination of things that are

4882.86 --> 4887.54
that can be

4884.36 --> 4889.58
and then program everything to link to

4887.54 --> 4892.58
everything else under every single

4889.58 --> 4895.88
conceivable circumstance yeah and then

4892.58 --> 4899.36
when that's finally over

4895.88 --> 4901.159000000001
then I can test it that can test like if

4899.36 --> 4903.98
it's actually working as it's supposed

4901.159 --> 4907.46
to work like the physics of it

4903.98 --> 4911.259999999999
or if there are unexpected errors

4907.46 --> 4911.26
or things that I overlooked

4912.38 --> 4918.86
little mistakes right

4915.199 --> 4921.739
but uh yeah the to actually like

4918.86 --> 4923.9
construct

4921.739 --> 4927.86
the engine is

4923.9 --> 4931.159
weird like I don't know

4927.86 --> 4932.839999999999
about that like I know how it's roughly

4931.159 --> 4934.759999999999
what it's supposed to be doing I don't

4932.84 --> 4937.28
know how to actually program that and

4934.76 --> 4941.5
like the considerations that you'll have

4937.28 --> 4941.5
to have and all that I have no idea

4944.06 --> 4949.04
like that's where an actual programmer's

4946.88 --> 4952.04
knowledge comes into play like because

4949.04 --> 4954.8
they know how to actually do this sort

4952.04 --> 4957.32
of thing and what you're gonna have to

4954.8 --> 4959.42
keep in mind and all that like oh you

4957.32 --> 4961.159
know how you do to use the memory and

4959.42 --> 4965.9
how you

4961.159 --> 4968.0
like what type of processing processes

4965.9 --> 4970.46
one of what kind of processing

4968.0 --> 4972.8
procedures are you going to address for

4970.46 --> 4975.86
this thing and that and that sort of

4972.8 --> 4977.719
[ __ ] I have absolutely no idea about any

4975.86 --> 4980.239
of that and it like thinking about it

4977.719 --> 4982.84
already gives me a headache

4980.239 --> 4982.839999999999
so

4990.56 --> 4995.1990000000005
if I got the neck for coding from

4995.239 --> 5002.5
I got the knack for systematics I am

4999.08 --> 5005.62
super systematic so I can very much work

5002.5 --> 5008.88
with copy paste which is a lot of what

5005.62 --> 5008.88
happens with programming

5021.12 --> 5026.32
and I'm also very well familiar with

5024.34 --> 5028.84
like switchboards

5026.32 --> 5033.099999999999
which is a lot of what programming also

5028.84 --> 5035.4400000000005
entails switchboards it's like if

5033.1 --> 5038.26
typical yeah the if I mean

5035.44 --> 5040.36
I I learned a little bit of program on

5038.26 --> 5045.0
the Commodore 64 and like everything is

5040.36 --> 5045.0
with ifs go to IFS

5045.1 --> 5050.5
so it's like oh you have in the check if

5048.76 --> 5052.84
this if it's this

5050.5 --> 5054.52
is what you do if it's that that's what

5052.84 --> 5057.28
you do if it's this this is what you do

5054.52 --> 5060.360000000001
if it isn't any of that well then don't

5057.28 --> 5060.36
do anything next

5063.1 --> 5067.92
and that should be very easily

5065.26 --> 5067.92
programmable

5068.44 --> 5072.879999999999
it's almost like you'd like you could

5070.54 --> 5077.46
just translate it from the described

5072.88 --> 5077.46
version to an actual programmed version

5085.32 --> 5093.719
man

5087.42 --> 5093.719
yeah by the way it's four pages by now

5105.1 --> 5110.280000000001
that's basic yeah I know it's basic but

5107.44 --> 5110.28
that works though

5121.12 --> 5125.32
her daughter-in-law a full game

5123.4 --> 5128.219
developer oh wow

5125.32 --> 5128.219
oh fruit

5134.98 --> 5139.259999999999
25 years Jesus that's a lot

5142.62 --> 5147.5199999999995
four to five weeks

5145.9 --> 5150.48
for the core

5147.52 --> 5150.4800000000005
really okay

5167.08 --> 5170.92
why are you saying I'm not taking your

5169.6 --> 5174.159000000001
advice

5170.92 --> 5177.06
it's just it's a bit as the steps are a

5174.159 --> 5177.0599999999995
bit far ahead

5178.48 --> 5182.62
look I I I'm not even fully

5180.82 --> 5183.94
understanding what it is that you're

5182.62 --> 5186.5199999999995
saying so

5183.94 --> 5188.86
take it easy I love to take your advice

5186.52 --> 5190.3
I'm just not there yet

5188.86 --> 5192.219
like

5190.3 --> 5194.139
we're already getting into a

5192.219 --> 5197.56
conversation that I technically didn't

5194.139 --> 5200.26
really want to get into because I'm not

5197.56 --> 5202.0
even close to that stage and it's a

5200.26 --> 5204.6990000000005
[ __ ] waste of time to think about

5202.0 --> 5207.219
that in my opinion

5204.699 --> 5211.12
like I just want to actually

5207.219 --> 5214.4800000000005
have the system ready and then

5211.12 --> 5219.34
like ready for programming because

5214.48 --> 5222.58
I can't still be working on the design

5219.34 --> 5226.96
of it before it starts programming the

5222.58 --> 5229.3
design must be complete before the

5226.96 --> 5231.52
programming gets starts because if you

5229.3 --> 5234.0
start redesigning

5231.52 --> 5239.580000000001
while you're programming off that thing

5234.0 --> 5239.58
it could all go to [ __ ] just like that

5241.36 --> 5246.28
try and explain it days ago okay fair

5243.52 --> 5248.92
fine but uh maybe you'd like to just

5246.28 --> 5250.659
come on the show and then talk or

5248.92 --> 5252.82
something

5250.659 --> 5256.86
because like

5252.82 --> 5256.86
I'm not getting it from the chat

5263.86 --> 5267.299999999999
oh gas h

5274.6 --> 5277.6
foreign

5279.219 --> 5283.44
no I've not seen that movie LSG

5300.52 --> 5305.26
huh okay I'm happy I didn't even know

5302.92 --> 5308.4
that that was an acronym

5305.26 --> 5308.400000000001
basic huh

5310.84 --> 5316.12
right anyway

5312.699 --> 5320.58
guys I'll just not talk about it anymore

5316.12 --> 5320.58
until I'm like done

5321.1 --> 5326.92
and I'll just talk about Flat Earth

5324.34 --> 5328.84
because I really appreciate the input

5326.92 --> 5331.54
but I'm literally I don't have the room

5328.84 --> 5334.179
to even like take it in it's like oh you

5331.54 --> 5336.28
could do this and that and then like

5334.179 --> 5338.86
I'm not there yet

5336.28 --> 5341.5599999999995
I mean it sounds really great I hope to

5338.86 --> 5346.0199999999995
have you around to advise me

5341.56 --> 5346.02
when I'm like done with this stage

5351.0 --> 5355.139
C cross platform yeah

5359.32 --> 5365.679
now I was actually thinking of just

5361.48 --> 5368.08
using C plus plus or something but uh

5365.679 --> 5370.54
the point is I don't want to talk about

5368.08 --> 5371.38
it right now because I still have to

5370.54 --> 5375.84
like

5371.38 --> 5375.84
make my mind up about the design of it

5378.88 --> 5383.679
I'm gonna have to like organize the

5381.159 --> 5386.879999999999
switchboard in total so that there's

5383.679 --> 5391.96
like this massive lattice of like

5386.88 --> 5394.56
500 by 500 or something and like every

5391.96 --> 5397.179
little freaking thing is crossed

5394.56 --> 5398.5
everything has like this is what

5397.179 --> 5399.6990000000005
happened this is what happened this is

5398.5 --> 5401.5
what happened this is what happens this

5399.699 --> 5403.659
is what happens with every freaking

5401.5 --> 5408.78
thing

5403.659 --> 5408.78
and so that's that's a big chore

5409.9 --> 5412.98
but once it's done

5434.1 --> 5440.820000000001
what the hell are you talking about LSG

5438.219 --> 5440.82
what

5442.0 --> 5447.36
take it you're joking it sounds quite

5444.52 --> 5447.360000000001
idiotic

5456.699 --> 5460.96
or is that

5458.38 --> 5463.26
a reference to that movie or something I

5460.96 --> 5463.26
don't know

5474.52 --> 5478.080000000001
God damn it

5488.92 --> 5495.96
easy to keep adding subroutines right

5493.0 --> 5495.96
exactly

5526.54 --> 5530.08
pre-written stuff yeah that will be very

5528.76 --> 5532.0
helpful

5530.08 --> 5534.219
the point is though is that I don't know

5532.0 --> 5537.159
anything about it I'm gonna have to like

5534.219 --> 5541.78
meet some guidance

5537.159 --> 5543.638999999999
that moment when I will

5541.78 --> 5547.12
not now

5543.639 --> 5548.92
yeah Claire not now like I don't want to

5547.12 --> 5550.9
hear about it now I don't want to hear

5548.92 --> 5552.88
about any of this now because I'm not

5550.9 --> 5554.92
going to be doing it now

5552.88 --> 5556.6
you don't want to hear about it now I

5554.92 --> 5559.4800000000005
don't want to have that feel of my mind

5556.6 --> 5562.84
now because I want to have the design

5559.48 --> 5564.28
process fill up my mind right now

5562.84 --> 5566.32
thanks

5564.28 --> 5568.78
so I really appreciate all this

5566.32 --> 5571.84
enthusiasm and it's going to be great

5568.78 --> 5573.699
let's move on oh I'm actually gonna

5571.84 --> 5576.04
round out the show soon so I guess it's

5573.699 --> 5577.9
gonna be all the bull that show all the

5576.04 --> 5580.6
bulldash in the world

5577.9 --> 5582.28
entire shows just pull the dash it's the

5580.6 --> 5584.679
only [ __ ] thing I talk about now

5582.28 --> 5587.92
maybe I should just call it the Bola

5584.679 --> 5589.2390000000005
Dash early bird show

5587.92 --> 5592.32
because that's all we're gonna be

5589.239 --> 5592.32
talking about right now

5595.56 --> 5600.3
I mean dude we have the Flat Earth

5598.75 --> 5603.219
[Music]

5600.3 --> 5607.08
so much there's not just so little left

5603.219 --> 5607.08
to talk about really I mean

5609.219 --> 5615.4
look at the [ __ ] hell

5612.4 --> 5615.4
die

5617.08 --> 5619.44
[ __ ]

5629.44 --> 5636.54
I'd love to talk about Flat Earth but I

5632.02 --> 5636.540000000001
mean yeah what about it would I talk

5643.02 --> 5648.780000000001
if it is almost the same show over and

5645.82 --> 5648.78
over yeah a little bit

5649.06 --> 5653.02
but I mean there's interesting new

5650.739 --> 5655.12
details though but there's also a lot of

5653.02 --> 5659.040000000001
rehashing of well

5655.12 --> 5659.04
not so old details

5667.96 --> 5674.1
I mean some of the reviews can be kind

5671.56 --> 5674.1
of interesting

5678.52 --> 5682.84
5 a.m for you

5681.34 --> 5687.0
wow that's Lake

5682.84 --> 5687.0
right so I'm gonna round out the show

5687.52 --> 5692.040000000001
it's a bit more diverse here than a

5689.32 --> 5692.04
refugee yes

5693.159 --> 5698.32
but I still would like to talk about

5695.44 --> 5700.419999999999
Flat Earth though there's still plenty

5698.32 --> 5701.92
to talk about or especially with

5700.42 --> 5706.56
newcomers like

5701.92 --> 5706.56
I have a lot of explanation capacity

5707.08 --> 5712.0599999999995
about it

5709.36 --> 5715.98
but it doesn't yeah you guys will just

5712.06 --> 5715.9800000000005
yeah you will just get it so

5717.4 --> 5722.82
oh S I don't have a freaking mobile

5723.04 --> 5727.26
I don't have a smartphone low fruit

5731.38 --> 5738.34
right anyhow I'm gonna run out the show

5736.06 --> 5741.360000000001
and I want some support

5738.34 --> 5741.360000000001
I really do

5746.86 --> 5751.0599999999995
hey and you could even like send me

5749.02 --> 5753.159000000001
support and tell me like hey could you

5751.06 --> 5756.400000000001
please talk about this

5753.159 --> 5759.219
you could do that

5756.4 --> 5761.199
if you if you don't want me to just talk

5759.219 --> 5763.6
about boola Dash and have everybody in

5761.199 --> 5765.58
chat talk about programming

5763.6 --> 5769.08
because I get it that's not super

5765.58 --> 5769.08
riveting to a lot of people

5773.199 --> 5776.199
are

5778.36 --> 5783.4
you can get an elevation angle from a

5780.58 --> 5785.0199999999995
curved service yeah curve Baseline to be

5783.4 --> 5787.86
precise

5785.02 --> 5787.860000000001
but yes

5793.78 --> 5799.0599999999995
right anyhow thanks everyone for coming

time in a weekdays and 2 p.m at a

5811.719 --> 5816.1
certain time in the weekend and please

5813.76 --> 5818.62
also do support me through the PayPal

and that really need it and

5823.12 --> 5828.76
eventually if I don't get any more I

5826.36 --> 5830.679
will just discontinue I don't want I'm

5828.76 --> 5833.26
not gonna say not forever I'm just gonna

5830.679 --> 5834.52
do that previous routine you'll get the

5833.26 --> 5837.780000000001
tweet

5834.52 --> 5840.34
the X whatever saying yeah no show

5837.78 --> 5842.08
support me through the PayPal if you

5840.34 --> 5843.34
want to have a show that's what's gonna

5842.08 --> 5845.88
happen

5843.34 --> 5845.88
again

5851.98 --> 5857.138999999999
and yeah I get it like ooh but so that

5855.159 --> 5859.96
you could talk about games

5857.139 --> 5861.9400000000005
I get it we don't have to talk about it

5859.96 --> 5863.92
we don't have to talk about bulldash
