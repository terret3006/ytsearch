88.84 --> 95.84
today

91.72 --> 95.84
yeah it was kind of Sunny

96.56 --> 102.56
earlier but yeah clouds have moved

100.399 --> 106.399
over

102.56 --> 109.07900000000001
so it's not been very rainy thus far

106.399 --> 109.07900000000001
yesterday

111.399 --> 118.84
was at times now not so

115.88 --> 120.92
much although yeah that might still

118.84 --> 127.0
happen

120.92 --> 127.0
but yeah uh some I don't know moderate

131.92 --> 136.67999999999998
wind it is a little less cold than it

135.16 --> 140.79999999999998
was a while

136.68 --> 145.59900000000002
ago I think I know what is what is the

140.8 --> 145.59900000000002
temperature H let me

148.76 --> 155.39999999999998
check

151.08 --> 155.4
hm right 16°

163.08 --> 171.8
C all right anyway it is Saturday the

168.28 --> 171.8
21st of October

175.36 --> 181.76000000000002
2023 is that a special

178.76 --> 181.76
date

187.319 --> 197.56
I always thinking the 21s often end up

192.44 --> 197.56
being like the solstice like the what is

198.319 --> 203.0
it the pagan holidays or whatever you

201.48 --> 205.56
want to call them these certain

203.0 --> 208.68
Celestial

205.56 --> 212.56
moments was it 21st of

208.68 --> 213.43900000000002
October or was that the 21st of November

212.56 --> 216.36
I'm not

213.439 --> 218.35999999999999
sure

216.36 --> 220.43900000000002
anyway right I was going to have

218.36 --> 225.12
original D Rose on

220.439 --> 225.12
today but he has not shown up

226.0 --> 231.84
yet hope that something unexpected

228.959 --> 231.84
didn't happen

232.879 --> 237.0
again he said that he was going to come

235.319 --> 239.83999999999997
on today

237.0 --> 242.319
but yeah he hasn't shown up for on on

239.84 --> 245.31900000000002
Skype in a long time so we'll see what

242.319 --> 247.76
happens maybe he shows up maybe he

245.319 --> 250.07899999999998
won't maybe somebody's going to show up

247.76 --> 250.07899999999998
in the

268.6 --> 271.6
chat

281.639 --> 285.32
oh let me check my spam

289.4 --> 292.4
mail

296.88 --> 301.88
wow oh my God this guy is still go

302.88 --> 309.039
and like with some of these trolls I

305.72 --> 309.03900000000004
really wonder are

310.479 --> 316.12
they do they just think I'm their friend

313.96 --> 319.23999999999995
or

316.12 --> 323.16
something it's so weird that they just

319.24 --> 325.16
keep sending all these messages I mean

323.16 --> 327.84000000000003
they really want my attention like I'm

325.16 --> 331.47900000000004
their friend or something and like dude

327.84 --> 331.479
this I'm not reading that crap

334.96 --> 343.23999999999995
like I don't reciprocate communication

339.6 --> 345.88
with people that are that socially

343.24 --> 348.639
deranged you don't communicate in that

345.88 --> 351.84
way you don't talk to somebody like that

348.639 --> 351.84000000000003
doesn't matter what it's

353.039 --> 358.84
for you can't just show up and pretend

356.0 --> 361.12
that your dad doesn't work like that

358.84 --> 363.35999999999996
it's ridiculous ulous anyway hello

361.12 --> 365.319
Richard G first in chat and clutch good

363.36 --> 367.7
to see

365.319 --> 372.70000000000005
you how you guys

367.7 --> 372.7
[Music]

373.84 --> 380.44
doing I'm doing pretty

376.319 --> 382.44
good I'm like stucked up on stuff

380.44 --> 386.759
again

382.44 --> 388.4
food smoke wear all that stuff so I'm

386.759 --> 391.40000000000003
feeling pretty

388.4 --> 391.4
good

394.599 --> 401.639
yeah there's new development though in

396.84 --> 404.67999999999995
our wiland like I am I seem to be going

401.639 --> 404.68
back on coffee

405.039 --> 410.919
again and I'm wondering if I'm going to

407.28 --> 413.0
pull the brakes on that cuz I am like

410.919 --> 415.4
kind of really enjoying it in the

413.0 --> 418.4
evenings early evenings

415.4 --> 421.4
like what is

418.4 --> 421.4
it

425.12 --> 431.639
H like roughly into when normally the

429.4 --> 434.31899999999996
the early I know the flatter of theb

431.639 --> 434.319
after show would

434.96 --> 440.919
start that sort of time so it's not too

438.199 --> 444.16
late that it really keeps me up and it

440.919 --> 447.24
just really stimulates me but not like

444.16 --> 449.16
I'm very haard to like Oh I thought even

447.24 --> 451.199
this morning like maybe I should just

449.16 --> 454.40000000000003
make naked tumeric coffee again on the

451.199 --> 456.879
show like for Good Old Time sake but

454.4 --> 460.039
then I realized wow if I did that I'd

456.879 --> 461.08000000000004
get like sick again so I'm not it

460.039 --> 464.0
doesn't

461.08 --> 467.19899999999996
work

464.0 --> 472.56
unfortunately and also I am literally

467.199 --> 475.199
detecting skin issues coming back very

472.56 --> 475.199
like that was

475.84 --> 480.0
quick it's not that bad yet but it was

478.759 --> 482.40000000000003
very quick

480.0 --> 484.319
no like noticeable it's not like who

482.4 --> 486.96
it's all terrible but I'm starting to

484.319 --> 490.91900000000004
feel it on my skin very

486.96 --> 494.08
quick so yeah it has been very

490.919 --> 497.28
stimulating as coffee should be but I

494.08 --> 497.28
think I'm going to like try

497.319 --> 500.96000000000004
to drop it

503.919 --> 510.12
again right and I'm I'm literally

506.759 --> 516.08
talking about like one car coffee in a

510.12 --> 519.279
day like oh my God one coffee holy

516.08 --> 521.719
[ __ ] I know right some of these guys out

519.279 --> 525.56
there drinking like six or eight coffees

521.719 --> 527.9200000000001
a day I'm like dude even when I was like

525.56 --> 530.88
a coffee junkie I could never drink that

527.92 --> 533.88
much coffee I would

530.88 --> 537.64
like you'd have to hospitalize me like

533.88 --> 537.64
after a week if I drank that much

538.2 --> 544.36
coffee like even when I was young I

541.92 --> 548.4799999999999
would not handle that

544.36 --> 551.399
much like when I was early in my 20s in

548.48 --> 555.399
my top Constitution physically like I

551.399 --> 555.399
would not be able to handle that much

558.44 --> 563.48
coffee moderation is best yeah but it's

561.24 --> 567.04
one cup a day moderation because I'm

563.48 --> 570.2
already feeling the downside of

567.04 --> 573.1999999999999
it four or five

570.2 --> 573.2
wow

574.56 --> 582.92
yeah well I do very much see coffee kind

579.2 --> 585.8000000000001
of in the same line as alcohol how dare

582.92 --> 589.3199999999999
you because of the physical consequences

585.8 --> 592.76
for me at least and some other people

589.32 --> 594.88
too I mean

592.76 --> 597.36
arguably yeah I don't want to bring it

594.88 --> 599.8389999999999
up but there are some people out there

597.36 --> 601.92
that have ISS that have physical

599.839 --> 604.0400000000001
issues a lot of them because they drink

601.92 --> 606.8389999999999
coffee they just can't stop they they

604.04 --> 611.959
can't stop they're too

606.839 --> 611.9590000000001
addicted because it can be severely

614.0 --> 618.48
addicting and that's the part where I'm

616.32 --> 621.0790000000001
not very happy to invite coffee back

618.48 --> 625.32
into my life even though it's one

621.079 --> 630.0
amazing one cup a day which is

625.32 --> 633.32
like one and a half scoop it's like

630.0 --> 637.44
it's nothing but to me it's like holy

633.32 --> 640.839
[ __ ] I don't know man coffee cocaine

637.44 --> 643.23
it's all the same or something with me

640.839 --> 646.0400000000001
the coffee just makes an enormous

643.23 --> 650.6
[Music]

646.04 --> 650.5999999999999
impact but also the downside so

651.079 --> 656.88
anyway I don't know I really haven't had

654.04 --> 661.0
like cocaine to compare it with so I

656.88 --> 664.079
don't want to try that seems

661.0 --> 667.04
scary I've had simulated experiences of

664.079 --> 670.16
it also because other

667.04 --> 672.76
people being on it and then basically

670.16 --> 674.8
just taking over the frequency and then

672.76 --> 678.2
you kind of know what it's

674.8 --> 679.8389999999999
like but yeah I'm never putting that

678.2 --> 683.36
[ __ ] in my

679.839 --> 686.2790000000001
system or not the process stuff

683.36 --> 688.0
anyway I mean a cocoa Leaf I'd be

686.279 --> 691.639
curious to like have a cocoa Leaf just

688.0 --> 691.639
like chew on it just see what kind of

693.76 --> 700.079
happens like what that does I think that

696.8 --> 703.279
just normal coca leave unprocessed I

700.079 --> 705.4399999999999
think that that should be fine it might

703.279 --> 709.0
still be very addictive though I don't

705.44 --> 711.8800000000001
know but like I'd be willing to try that

709.0 --> 713.44
like one time I'm never willing to try

711.88 --> 717.959
like actual

713.44 --> 720.519
cocaine that's that's still illegal I

717.959 --> 723.1199999999999
think

720.519 --> 726.5600000000001
whatever it's like all these terrible

723.12 --> 731.16
people seem to be using it so this a bad

726.56 --> 731.16
sign sign that I don't want to be using

731.93 --> 741.92
[Music]

737.959 --> 745.5189999999999
it I don't get at least

741.92 --> 745.519
one fa

747.88 --> 753.32
withdrawal

749.839 --> 758.399
maybe metal slugs cockail

753.32 --> 758.399
but the mental withdrawal is pretty

758.8 --> 764.4399999999999
severe like with some people in tobacco

761.519 --> 767.399
like my dad had like severe mental

764.44 --> 770.72
issues with tobacco smoking like it's

767.399 --> 770.72
really hard to get out of his

770.839 --> 777.1600000000001
system and like you had to really fight

774.279 --> 779.72
to to overcome

777.16 --> 782.3199999999999
that the so the men mental addictions

779.72 --> 785.279
should definitely not be

782.32 --> 788.0790000000001
underestimated and I mean yeah physical

785.279 --> 790.519
withdrawal yeah that's

788.079 --> 793.399
terrible but as long as you don't get

790.519 --> 793.399
killed from it I

793.68 --> 799.4399999999999
mean this sounds weird I mean I never

797.279 --> 802.32
would say like oh yeah withdrawal it's

799.44 --> 804.12
nothing or whatever but like I'd rather

802.32 --> 806.32
have physical withdrawal than mental

804.12 --> 807.76
withdrawal because mental withdrawal is

806.32 --> 811.1600000000001
just

807.76 --> 813.639
like is like an obsession that just

811.16 --> 816.6
pushes itself on you and that is like

813.639 --> 819.639
super difficult for

816.6 --> 822.44
anyone while just enduring terrible

819.639 --> 825.36
times I mean it's almost like thank you

822.44 --> 828.12
for the reminder of how what this

825.36 --> 831.0
freaking drug actually does to you like

828.12 --> 834.639
physical withdrawal is

831.0 --> 836.72
like at least it's like more honest it's

834.639 --> 839.759
not seducive

836.72 --> 842.6
seducting seductive

839.759 --> 845.6
it's just honest while mental seduction

842.6 --> 848.6
is like just the obsessive seduction

845.6 --> 850.1990000000001
continually it's it drive anybody insane

848.6 --> 853.6
and like how the hell do you get away

850.199 --> 855.3599999999999
from it it can be really difficult to

853.6 --> 857.9590000000001
find something that will properly

855.36 --> 860.6
distract you away from

857.959 --> 862.1199999999999
it because everybody everything reminds

860.6 --> 865.839
you of it often because mental

862.12 --> 869.5600000000001
addictions come forth from you using it

865.839 --> 873.0400000000001
to boost your Peak moments

869.56 --> 876.399
so every time any Peak enthusiasm comes

873.04 --> 878.8
along you will want that

876.399 --> 882.519
thing that's kind of the seduction

878.8 --> 884.279
effect it's terrible so let yeah maybe

882.519 --> 889.079
there's no physical withdrawal in coffee

884.279 --> 889.079
but the mental addiction can be quite

891.72 --> 897.36
severe but uh I'm I'm certain that I'll

895.24 --> 900.72
be able to face

897.36 --> 903.04
it it's just just that I didn't expect

900.72 --> 906.1990000000001
it to be so great

903.04 --> 908.8389999999999
again that was the because like the last

906.199 --> 910.8
times that I was drinking it it was just

908.839 --> 913.5600000000001
all terrible I didn't have any positive

910.8 --> 915.7589999999999
effects out of it it's only the negative

913.56 --> 917.67
side effects

915.759 --> 920.92
H all

917.67 --> 924.9399999999999
[Music]

920.92 --> 927.5999999999999
right so yeah that's happening coffee

924.94 --> 929.3190000000001
[Music]

927.6 --> 933.36
challenge

929.319 --> 933.36
hey fiber Roes good to see

937.16 --> 940.92
you and metal looks

942.48 --> 947.44
COA mental addictions oh well lucky

947.8 --> 951.5999999999999
you hello Brandon

956.24 --> 960.9590000000001
Cook OCD seems like like it

976.36 --> 983.92
even I don't know yeah OCD is not the

979.72 --> 986.6
same as addiction it's mental addiction

983.92 --> 989.12
though it's different it's like a a

986.6 --> 991.519
nervous tweak

989.12 --> 994.16
thing so it's rather the tension

991.519 --> 995.759
building up and then it's like uh do it

994.16 --> 999.04
that's not the same

995.759 --> 1001.6800000000001
as an Associated longing where you

999.04 --> 1003.8
literally associate a frequency with a

1001.68 --> 1006.8389999999999
certain thing and then long for

1003.8 --> 1008.3599999999999
it that's that's actual mental addiction

1006.839 --> 1011.0
that's much

1008.36 --> 1012.8000000000001
harder that's also what makes smoking so

1011.0 --> 1015.92
tough to stop that because there's a

1012.8 --> 1018.7199999999999
whole routine that comes with it and

1015.92 --> 1019.8
almost like a category it's another

1018.72 --> 1021.839
social

1019.8 --> 1024.48
category that's what I thought was so

1021.839 --> 1026.64
brilliant about smoking is that it

1024.48 --> 1029.679
separated you in a category and that

1026.64 --> 1032.3600000000001
made smokers even though they're like

1029.679 --> 1034.3190000000002
very much not the typical people I would

1032.36 --> 1036.799
work around hang around if they weren't

1034.319 --> 1038.4389999999999
smokers makes me able to socially

1036.799 --> 1040.8799999999999
communicate with them

1038.439 --> 1043.8390000000002
easier and they then they freaking

1040.88 --> 1049.72
attacked smoking in sadly oh that's gone

1043.839 --> 1051.36
oh yeah let's cut down on S Arwin social

1049.72 --> 1055.44
communication some

1051.36 --> 1058.039
more let's make it a taboo smoking great

1055.44 --> 1058.039
freaking

1070.08 --> 1075.1999999999998
great what are you talking about brand

1075.48 --> 1084.84
cook social Ian Amer American maxan aric

1082.159 --> 1084.8400000000001
Le

1085.6 --> 1090.1589999999999
what I don't know what you're talking

1087.84 --> 1093.4399999999998
about is there some kind of Meetup thing

1090.159 --> 1096.96
I guess with Max Egan in

1093.44 --> 1100.88
there leka

1096.96 --> 1105.159
really so it's going to be an all around

1100.88 --> 1107.3200000000002
blabber Fest then with wild speculations

1105.159 --> 1108.88
all over the

1107.32 --> 1111.559
place

1108.88 --> 1114.7990000000002
sounds like a giant hippie

1111.559 --> 1119.559
Fest a

1114.799 --> 1119.559
conference right so it is a giant hippie

1119.799 --> 1126.52
Fest soall why the hell would you call

1123.08 --> 1126.52
it soall that's

1132.28 --> 1137.32
weird the Feast of nonsense yeah that

1135.72 --> 1141.64
that's kind of what it

1137.32 --> 1141.6399999999999
is or you could call it hippie

1149.24 --> 1156.6
Fest I mean I'd have fun at hippy Fest I

1153.039 --> 1160.1589999999999
think like just put me in there I'll

1156.6 --> 1163.0
talk I'll talk all of it say the whole

1160.159 --> 1164.2
stuff whatever man if people give a [ __ ]

1163.0 --> 1167.24
about

1164.2 --> 1168.88
that they probably

1167.24 --> 1171.52
wouldn't

1168.88 --> 1173.44
CU I'm not a discer and I'm like oh but

1171.52 --> 1175.32
yeah Arwin always has a different

1173.44 --> 1178.919
version for everything why does he

1175.32 --> 1178.9189999999999
always have to make things more

1197.24 --> 1200.24
complicated

1203.76 --> 1208.039
hippies are the best people for n

1205.76 --> 1212.6
nervous nelli

1208.039 --> 1214.84
is yeah no I mean I dude I am I grew up

1212.6 --> 1214.84
with

1216.799 --> 1223.96
hippies like I technically was like a

1220.679 --> 1226.3600000000001
hyperactive dude not s yeah it's like

1223.96 --> 1228.4
really smart and hyperactive not super

1226.36 --> 1230.4399999999998
hyperactive that it's like always always

1228.4 --> 1233.2800000000002
getting on your nerves but when you're

1230.44 --> 1236.159
hyperactive it's like

1233.28 --> 1239.12
hippies are like almost the only people

1236.159 --> 1241.48
you can even like have a conversation

1239.12 --> 1243.84
with without it turning into some hyped

1241.48 --> 1243.84
up

1247.2 --> 1252.52
situation cuz I just have this tendency

1249.72 --> 1256.76
to wind people up

1252.52 --> 1259.0
naturally and cats too so and just like

1256.76 --> 1261.24
with cats they get excited they get like

1259.0 --> 1263.2
really into it and then it like becomes

1261.24 --> 1268.1200000000001
too much for them and then

1263.2 --> 1268.1200000000001
it's and the people do that too

1270.159 --> 1277.64
socially and like hippies are the only

1272.64 --> 1277.64
ones that like don't

1287.039 --> 1290.039
bite

1294.039 --> 1299.96
the one of the funniest and things about

1297.039 --> 1302.4
hippies Is that real hippie when there's

1299.96 --> 1304.559
something like somebody like really like

1302.4 --> 1306.679
foaming at the mouth going completely

1304.559 --> 1308.8799999999999
over the top not necessarily physically

1306.679 --> 1311.919
aggressive but just going completely ape

1308.88 --> 1315.6000000000001
[ __ ] mentally then hippies can always

1311.919 --> 1319.0800000000002
like a real hippie can always like react

1315.6 --> 1320.48
super overly calm

1319.08 --> 1322.72
in a funny

1320.48 --> 1325.52
way that

1322.72 --> 1328.96
like where they can just like really

1325.52 --> 1331.2
like respond like oh no that wasn't OV

1328.96 --> 1333.52
exaggerated at all and just respond

1331.2 --> 1333.52
really

1336.36 --> 1340.3999999999999
calmly and then kind of make it

1341.279 --> 1346.159
funny and I personally learned that

1343.76 --> 1349.96
trick too from

1346.159 --> 1349.96
hippies but like yeah

1351.04 --> 1356.1589999999999
[Music]

1352.84 --> 1358.559
like Martin leka knows that trick he

1356.159 --> 1358.5590000000002
such a

1367.559 --> 1371.9189999999999
heavy but I mean it's a great skill I

1370.0 --> 1375.159
have around

1371.919 --> 1377.279
so where the hell am I going with this

1375.159 --> 1379.159
conversation I don't know yeah D Rose

1377.279 --> 1382.76
isn't showing

1379.159 --> 1382.7600000000002
up hope he's all

1387.44 --> 1394.6000000000001
right OG hippies are all 70 yeah they're

1391.36 --> 1398.6789999999999
all old Crohns and hippies

1394.6 --> 1398.6789999999999
yeah they're old witches

1399.52 --> 1403.12
now witches and

1403.76 --> 1409.12
wizards I mean if they make it that long

1406.48 --> 1410.799
without going completely in say an sjw

1409.12 --> 1413.559
or

1410.799 --> 1417.12
something then they turn into like

1413.559 --> 1417.12
witches and wizards like the good

1417.679 --> 1425.48
kind but just like unexpected amounts of

1421.88 --> 1429.1200000000001
knowledge about nature and medicine

1425.48 --> 1429.1200000000001
and that's the good

1431.72 --> 1438.039
[Music]

1435.48 --> 1441.32
stuff yeah and I started out as a a

1438.039 --> 1444.12
hippie too it's just that my hippie face

1441.32 --> 1444.12
started in my

1448.279 --> 1454.76
teens and then with that also yeah was

1451.96 --> 1456.679
an inevitable apparently that I got into

1454.76 --> 1460.279
cannabis smoking

1456.679 --> 1462.4
too like at 15 which is like kind of a

1460.279 --> 1465.919
bit young for

1462.4 --> 1465.919
that did it a

1466.799 --> 1469.799
secret

1471.039 --> 1474.679
but man it

1476.44 --> 1482.76
like it did change

1479.2 --> 1482.76
everything totally

1482.88 --> 1488.679
everything because it switched me from

1485.36 --> 1492.0
just not really great at communication

1488.679 --> 1494.8400000000001
even on one-on-one level with comp like

1492.0 --> 1497.039
I would I had a lot of anxiety and

1494.84 --> 1498.8799999999999
communication all around so I could

1497.039 --> 1502.2
communicate pretty decently with

1498.88 --> 1502.2
oneon-one but I'd get

1502.24 --> 1507.84
flustered or I wouldn't be I wouldn't be

1506.0 --> 1510.24
able to like communicate in a way that

1507.84 --> 1513.399
it could be understood

1510.24 --> 1517.08
properly I would just be too much in my

1513.399 --> 1519.32
way of thinking which is like too alien

1517.08 --> 1523.1999999999998
for people that don't think like

1519.32 --> 1525.399
that but when I then like literally the

1523.2 --> 1527.279
moment that I would have smoked and I

1525.399 --> 1530.039
would be with somebody and then try to

1527.279 --> 1534.96
communicate like it would completely

1530.039 --> 1537.6
change and suddenly I can explain things

1534.96 --> 1541.3990000000001
explicably and it would also go into

1537.6 --> 1543.24
like all the like tunnels like whoa dude

1541.399 --> 1546.279
crazy thoughts yeah that would happen

1543.24 --> 1548.24
too but I would kind of avoid it but the

1546.279 --> 1550.2
the thing that stood out to me is like

1548.24 --> 1553.76
suddenly I'm

1550.2 --> 1558.48
not isolated I like I can actually

1553.76 --> 1562.0
communicate it to the man or woman

1558.48 --> 1564.6
I didn't have an anxiety issue that was

1562.0 --> 1567.76
getting in the way like a barrier so

1564.6 --> 1570.1999999999998
that broke it it did that for me Canada

1567.76 --> 1572.12
did that for me it made me capable of

1570.2 --> 1574.799
suddenly communicating

1572.12 --> 1579.279
properly and that last it it doesn't go

1574.799 --> 1579.279
away when I stop cannabis

1585.279 --> 1589.6
smoking right it's taking the edge

1590.84 --> 1597.08
off and suddenly like the EDG it's like

1595.159 --> 1599.679
yeah the edges off and suddenly The

1597.08 --> 1602.559
Roots were able to grow

1599.679 --> 1604.5590000000002
there and then the roots stayed so even

1602.559 --> 1607.6
though the nervousness was still in the

1604.559 --> 1611.6
way the roots were already there so it

1607.6 --> 1611.6
would I I now had that

1611.679 --> 1618.48
skill where before every communication

1615.039 --> 1621.559
was always ladened with anxiety and and

1618.48 --> 1624.0
stumbling because of that every freaking

1621.559 --> 1625.84
time very rare that it wasn't I would

1624.0 --> 1627.84
really have to have admiration for

1625.84 --> 1630.32
somebody and like feel really connected

1627.84 --> 1632.84
to have that not

1630.32 --> 1635.6789999999999
happen and then I smoked cannabis like

1632.84 --> 1641.279
at 15 and then suddenly that stopped and

1635.679 --> 1641.279
now I was capable of doing that

1642.44 --> 1649.3200000000002
but it faced me with another darkness of

1646.799 --> 1652.9189999999999
reality that started staring me in in

1649.32 --> 1657.12
the face in which my personal anxiety

1652.919 --> 1660.3200000000002
had actually distracted me away from

1657.12 --> 1662.6789999999999
that because now that I could

1660.32 --> 1665.6789999999999
communicate properly I was suddenly

1662.679 --> 1668.1200000000001
facing the real challenge of the

1665.679 --> 1671.159
world which I didn't even like really

1668.12 --> 1671.1589999999999
know the depths of

1671.76 --> 1678.08
yet which I figured out like around my

1675.919 --> 1679.1200000000001
20th 21

1678.08 --> 1682.32
and

1679.12 --> 1683.399
that's yeah where it literally went all

1682.32 --> 1687.6
the

1683.399 --> 1689.9189999999999
hell or accept my soul that is I think

1687.6 --> 1693.8799999999999
but I went through some crazy

1689.919 --> 1693.88
times psychedelically

1696.48 --> 1702.279
too or it's not even psychedelically it

1699.279 --> 1705.48
it's like I wasn't like tripping on acid

1702.279 --> 1708.32
and [ __ ] I was smoking cannabis sure but

1705.48 --> 1711.2
I wasn't like all the hall ations was

1708.32 --> 1714.799
really just from the The

1711.2 --> 1717.799
Terror from being afraid of something

1714.799 --> 1720.12
that other people don't even see but it

1717.799 --> 1722.12
was real and I was constantly struggling

1720.12 --> 1726.279
with is it reality isn't it

1722.12 --> 1726.279
reality oh it's D Ros hold

1775.279 --> 1780.84
up Nathan what's up uh who was it uh who

1779.0 --> 1784.12
just asked a question about fiber oats

1780.84 --> 1786.72
what's up dude like I said in the thread

1784.12 --> 1790.08
15 is the average age at least in

1786.72 --> 1791.84
America for any teenager to experiment

1790.08 --> 1796.12
either with

1791.84 --> 1799.9599999999998
cannabis alcohol or a cigarette

1796.12 --> 1799.9599999999998
right and and

1800.159 --> 1805.3200000000002
sex keep it

1802.399 --> 1806.799
100 you know whether you want to say our

1805.32 --> 1809.48
morals are kind of jacked up our

1806.799 --> 1811.12
parenting is not as great as it could be

1809.48 --> 1812.84
but you know teenagers going to do what

1811.12 --> 1815.1589999999999
they want to do even if even if they got

1812.84 --> 1817.12
strict you know Carri patients like

1815.159 --> 1819.8400000000001
car's mother it doesn't matter you know

1817.12 --> 1822.7199999999998
oh it's it's worse than that like if

1819.84 --> 1826.399
especially if the parents are strict it

1822.72 --> 1828.88
makes it even more tempting to like not

1826.399 --> 1831.84
not to get caught up in it but to try it

1828.88 --> 1835.159
even once it's like why the hassle right

1831.84 --> 1838.12
that that's what it was with

1835.159 --> 1840.2
me because there was such a because such

1838.12 --> 1842.799
a lot of people were so talking so [ __ ]

1840.2 --> 1845.0
talking about cannabis at the time in

1842.799 --> 1846.399
the Netherlands right because

1845.0 --> 1850.44
Netherlands was like sort of the

1846.399 --> 1853.6789999999999
Forerunner of like trying to legalize it

1850.44 --> 1856.24
halfway right like we have it now where

1853.679 --> 1858.96
it's condoned basically Condon policy

1856.24 --> 1862.559
and it works fine yeah yeah but there

1858.96 --> 1864.6390000000001
was a lot of like outspokenness against

1862.559 --> 1866.84
it like people were really against it

1864.639 --> 1869.519
they thought it's a drug Invasion there

1866.84 --> 1872.0
was a lot of propaganda in the news and

1869.519 --> 1873.96
so in media on

1872.0 --> 1875.639
television same thing in United States

1873.96 --> 1878.0
of America the same way and now it's

1875.639 --> 1880.1999999999998
infectiously becoming the norm there's a

1878.0 --> 1881.84
lot of dispensaries everywhere states

1880.2 --> 1883.0800000000002
that you know I mean like we're in

1881.84 --> 1884.559
Virginia and everywhere they didn't even

1883.08 --> 1886.84
have the lottery they have the lottery

1884.559 --> 1888.96
now now they now they've even went far

1886.84 --> 1890.8799999999999
as doing the Cannabis so it just said

1888.96 --> 1893.1200000000001
wherever there's money to be made

1890.88 --> 1896.24
there's legislation to accommodate it

1893.12 --> 1899.9599999999998
and there's way to just um shut down any

1896.24 --> 1903.48
type of religious factions or you know

1899.96 --> 1905.24
ethical factions to say what you know

1903.48 --> 1906.84
even if they mentioned a detriment to it

1905.24 --> 1908.3990000000001
but then they'll say well you know we

1906.84 --> 1911.84
got alcohol already so what's the

1908.399 --> 1913.559
difference I mean you can yeah you you

1911.84 --> 1915.639
know what I'm saying well the difference

1913.559 --> 1919.84
is that alcohol actually gets people

1915.639 --> 1922.4399999999998
killed there you go yeah exactly it's

1919.84 --> 1925.399
and not and not exclusively the the ones

1922.44 --> 1928.3990000000001
that use it yeah argument here's my

1925.399 --> 1932.12
argument when people compare cannabis to

1928.399 --> 1933.32
alcohol both yes now now I know I have I

1932.12 --> 1935.9189999999999
remember when I was in a music

1933.32 --> 1938.799
Convention in Miami and I handled the

1935.919 --> 1941.88
van that we drove without any issues

1938.799 --> 1943.8799999999999
compared to if I had a few drinks and

1941.88 --> 1947.6390000000001
handled the van parking and everything I

1943.88 --> 1950.2
was fine okay but thing about it is that

1947.639 --> 1952.4799999999998
um yes you shouldn't drive because

1950.2 --> 1954.159
people react differently under cannabis

1952.48 --> 1956.519
so you should not drive operate any

1954.159 --> 1957.7600000000002
Machinery doing it okay I do not condone

1956.519 --> 1959.44
doing that when you're doing it make

1957.76 --> 1961.399
sure you you're in an environment where

1959.44 --> 1962.6000000000001
you don't have to worry about Safety and

1961.399 --> 1965.4799999999998
Security and stuff like that so you

1962.6 --> 1967.9189999999999
could be have a a mind of sobriety but

1965.48 --> 1969.72
however take that alcoholic and sit them

1967.919 --> 1971.919
in the recliner watching the game and

1969.72 --> 1975.0
take the person of cannabis through the

1971.919 --> 1977.76
years that alcohol person will die

1975.0 --> 1980.24
degenerate and become

1977.76 --> 1982.48
overly intoxicated to the point of death

1980.24 --> 1984.0
whereas a person with cannabis you know

1982.48 --> 1985.48
other than getting fat and getting

1984.0 --> 1987.399
cavities and becoming a diabetic from

1985.48 --> 1989.3600000000001
eating from the munchies yeah the

1987.399 --> 1990.9599999999998
munchies will kill you it's not the

1989.36 --> 1993.6789999999999
Cannabis it's the munchies that will

1990.96 --> 1995.6000000000001
kill you man have you ever you ever been

1993.679 --> 1999.5590000000002
you ever been so nice that anything

1995.6 --> 2001.76
tastes good s like man anything tastes

1999.559 --> 2005.0
good man I'm put some ketchup on my um

2001.76 --> 2007.799
puffy um cheese Doodles oh my

2005.0 --> 2009.24
God things like no

2007.799 --> 2012.2
I'm just saying I'm just saying you just

2009.24 --> 2014.36
you your your your your pallet just you

2012.2 --> 2017.72
just want to eat you just have you just

2014.36 --> 2020.24
want to eat yeah but it's you it's

2017.72 --> 2023.3990000000001
something specific you seek right I

2020.24 --> 2028.679
don't know if you realize that so for me

2023.399 --> 2031.7199999999998
something that that gets calling is salt

2028.679 --> 2033.799
for me it's salt yeah I don't yeah well

2031.72 --> 2036.039
I have a solution to that I have literal

2033.799 --> 2039.24
rolls of salt they're not going to make

2036.039 --> 2041.2
me fat that just going to make me very

2039.24 --> 2043.32
salty okay but you mentioned just the

2041.2 --> 2046.919
other day that you like salt period so

2043.32 --> 2048.24
that's not fair you you said you said

2046.919 --> 2049.679
you remember you saying before I think

2048.24 --> 2051.0
it was day before yesterday you talking

2049.679 --> 2052.359
about salt you said that's one of the

2051.0 --> 2054.56
things you love to e we was all

2052.359 --> 2056.839
discussing sodium sodium chloride the

2054.56 --> 2060.56
dangers of salt yada yada the over the

2056.839 --> 2062.7999999999997
over table salt table salt right now me

2060.56 --> 2068.0
it don't matter like I have the salt

2062.8 --> 2070.8390000000004
sugar salt sweet um like Al alter

2068.0 --> 2072.8
alternative swapping so like let's say

2070.839 --> 2075.399
I'm hungry and I want to get some um

2072.8 --> 2077.04
tend chicken tenders or some pizza then

2075.399 --> 2078.6389999999997
all of a sudden after that I can kill

2077.04 --> 2081.32
like four honey

2078.639 --> 2083.8
buns that's how my Munchies go and then

2081.32 --> 2085.32
after that honey buns what's a honey bun

2083.8 --> 2088.32
you know honey bun is like a glazed

2085.32 --> 2089.8
donut think really think of it like a

2088.32 --> 2093.04
glazed donut yeah I just have this

2089.8 --> 2096.3990000000003
craving for sweet right after that Y and

2093.04 --> 2098.0
it goes back and forth so Sugar Rush

2096.399 --> 2099.88
yeah sugar rush and then when the Sugar

2098.0 --> 2101.64
Rush goes down and I have more Munchies

2099.88 --> 2103.6400000000003
then I go back to something like a bag

2101.64 --> 2106.7599999999998
of chips or or a sandwich you know

2103.64 --> 2110.4
something that has like a salt base so

2106.76 --> 2113.6800000000003
yeah right yeah I avoid sugar rushes man

2110.4 --> 2116.6800000000003
they are like really bad for me yeah

2113.68 --> 2118.48
I've had like really bad sugar addiction

2116.68 --> 2120.839
very young but even when I was very

2118.48 --> 2124.76
young it would like have really terrible

2120.839 --> 2128.0
side effects would it be the crashing no

2124.76 --> 2130.4
no like during the rush oh unexpected

2128.0 --> 2132.8
effects so you like run into a wall or

2130.4 --> 2134.2400000000002
something and be like next thing you

2132.8 --> 2135.4
know when it come down you you have a

2134.24 --> 2138.359
knot on your head you didn't even feel

2135.4 --> 2141.56
it something like that you're so active

2138.359 --> 2145.16
no well I would become like really

2141.56 --> 2148.96
evil okay yeah yeah it's like i' become

2145.16 --> 2152.8799999999997
so manic that I just start to like H how

2148.96 --> 2155.119
can I like ruin people's moments like

2152.88 --> 2157.119

2155.119 --> 2160.7200000000003
literally get possessed by a sht sugar

2157.119 --> 2162.359
demon basically I was one of those kids

when you had those sugar

2172.0 --> 2177.44
rushes just bit him or smacked them or

2175.72 --> 2178.839
smacked them and left the red mark on

2177.44 --> 2181.7200000000003
the back of their neck was

2178.839 --> 2184.44
you physically violent or I well I think

2181.72 --> 2187.319
I bit somebody once but then like they

2184.44 --> 2189.8
got so angry that I never did it again

2187.319 --> 2193.64
but just

2189.8 --> 2195.1600000000003
poking okay poking or startling people

2193.64 --> 2197.0789999999997
okay got like when they're completely

2195.16 --> 2199.839
unaware of me suddenly slapping them on

2197.079 --> 2204.2000000000003
the ass or something startle the [ __ ]

2199.839 --> 2206.0789999999997
out that just being a terrible annoying

2204.2 --> 2208.0
kid that that's like really

2206.079 --> 2209.599
inconspicuous but then you don't pay

2208.0 --> 2214.8
attention and then I started the [ __ ]

2209.599 --> 2217.6800000000003
out of you uhhuh uhhuh so sugar not good

2214.8 --> 2220.6400000000003
because it just made me do that

2217.68 --> 2222.44
so you still leave you're not a pastry

2220.64 --> 2224.2799999999997
person a person that deals with like

2222.44 --> 2226.2400000000002
you'll pass on a birthday cake slice of

2224.28 --> 2227.3190000000004
birthday cake is you because I don't

2226.24 --> 2230.0
want you to get worse because if you're

2227.319 --> 2233.7599999999998
adult no no no no no no that's different

2230.0 --> 2236.079
that's not now the thing is now if I now

2233.76 --> 2238.119
eat sugar this is one when I was a kid

2236.079 --> 2242.2400000000002
right because I can't tolerate it

2238.119 --> 2245.319
anymore like uh I get uh well I

2242.24 --> 2247.16
basically get a swollen

2245.319 --> 2250.119
pancreas I mean

2247.16 --> 2252.319
it's not like oh it's dying but I mean I

2250.119 --> 2254.6400000000003
it starts to hurt when I get too much

2252.319 --> 2258.119
sugar you know what and that's like

2254.64 --> 2260.72
physically hurt so it's like sugar alert

2258.119 --> 2262.839
too much sugar don't do

2260.72 --> 2264.9199999999996
that that's not that's not good and it

2262.839 --> 2268.0789999999997
really hurts if you ignore it it really

2264.92 --> 2271.079
hurts at night yeah so I just don't do

2268.079 --> 2274.88
it anymore I don't have like what do you

2271.079 --> 2278.1600000000003
call diabetes issues but I feel like if

2274.88 --> 2281.56
I L I could potten

2278.16 --> 2283.52
blow it out and then have per diabetes I

2281.56 --> 2286.48
guarantee you with that sign you having

2283.52 --> 2289.52
with the pancreatic discomfort you would

2286.48 --> 2291.76
have made yourself a type two at an

2289.52 --> 2295.56
early age or you could have even induced

2291.76 --> 2297.0400000000004
some other pancreatic issues later on so

2295.56 --> 2299.0
it was that was your body telling you

2297.04 --> 2301.64
then you know this is not for you

2299.0 --> 2304.319
especially that that grain that that

2301.64 --> 2307.359
processed yeah yeah the processed stuff

2304.319 --> 2309.96
but it's because it's poison you get the

2307.359 --> 2312.7999999999997
pancreas issues but you also get like

2309.96 --> 2316.16
poisonous issues which like play into

2312.8 --> 2318.96
this fungi that gives you cavities and

2316.16 --> 2321.1189999999997
might get you cancer and all that so

2318.96 --> 2323.92
it's like bad for your metabolism

2321.119 --> 2326.7200000000003
overall and it makes you I would suggest

2323.92 --> 2328.8
people to takes away from your skill to

2326.72 --> 2331.68
have um a thing called stevio I think

2328.8 --> 2333.8390000000004
it's a plant yeah yeah Stevia Ste yeah

2331.68 --> 2335.9199999999996
but I mean it's it doesn't help though

2333.839 --> 2338.7999999999997
because sugar addiction is sugar

2335.92 --> 2341.88
addiction if you try to replace it it's

2338.8 --> 2345.079
like trying to do meat replacement like

2341.88 --> 2348.28
there no point either you you just have

2345.079 --> 2351.6400000000003
to stop you just have to stop it just

2348.28 --> 2354.3590000000004
don't do it just be aware like this is

2351.64 --> 2357.56
poisonous that's continually like oh

2354.359 --> 2360.5989999999997
please I'm so I love you I love you

2357.56 --> 2361.7999999999997
poison it's the I love you poison just

2360.599 --> 2363.7200000000003
speaking speaking of that meat

2361.8 --> 2366.119
replacement you just mentioned um there

2363.72 --> 2367.9599999999996
was a it was like a it was it was just

2366.119 --> 2369.44
going on big now but now I guess now

2367.96 --> 2371.2400000000002
people are getting smarter but you know

2369.44 --> 2372.52
they got all these veggie based meats

2371.24 --> 2374.72
and everything like that I I don't know

2372.52 --> 2376.28
the real details of that cuz you can't

2374.72 --> 2378.1189999999997
i' I've had veggie patties and you can

2376.28 --> 2379.76
actually use vegetables and and have it

2378.119 --> 2382.44
to make it cook it and it doesn't taste

2379.76 --> 2385.28
like meat but right just use vegetables

2382.44 --> 2387.56
like what do you mean meat replacement

2385.28 --> 2389.44
that's that stuff is disgusting and I've

2387.56 --> 2394.0
made like spaghetti of all kinds I used

2389.44 --> 2397.68
to have uh meatloaf beef and then

2394.0 --> 2399.16
sometimes yeah friends came over my ex

2397.68 --> 2401.839
and they were

2399.16 --> 2404.24
vegetarian uh or they were vegan so we

2401.839 --> 2406.48
had like I made a special batch with

2404.24 --> 2408.5989999999997
like meat replacement and that stuff

2406.48 --> 2410.92
like it's just disgusting I can't

2408.599 --> 2413.839
believe that people eat that like I

2410.92 --> 2416.0
can't believe it but they do and like I

2413.839 --> 2418.4
don't even understand it because when I

2416.0 --> 2421.319
make my spaghetti it's like I have no

2418.4 --> 2424.96
meat I don't get any meat replacement

2421.319 --> 2429.119
garbage I just put carrots in there and

2424.96 --> 2431.64
I I take an an plant and add it that's

2429.119 --> 2435.359
good enough like I don't like there's so

2431.64 --> 2437.04
much in there I don't need all so what

2435.359 --> 2438.5989999999997
about the big soy phenomenon that went

2437.04 --> 2440.72
on it was like a soy thing going it was

2438.599 --> 2442.96
used to be real Popular until men

2440.72 --> 2445.1189999999997
started getting this case I forgot the

2442.96 --> 2446.8
name of the medical term but it's when

2445.119 --> 2449.6800000000003
the tips of your nipples start

2446.8 --> 2453.599
protruding it's called mam or something

2449.68 --> 2457.04
and it's from soy um from too much so

2453.599 --> 2458.8
and also yeah soy boy and also soy from

2457.04 --> 2461.96
what I remember um I think it was

2458.8 --> 2463.76
Washington Carver the peanut guy he said

2461.96 --> 2465.079
that he he breaks down that soy was

2463.76 --> 2467.76
never supposed to be consumed by the

2465.079 --> 2471.6400000000003
human body so was used as some type of

2467.76 --> 2473.48
um in some type of um stringent cleaning

2471.64 --> 2475.319
for machines or something like the oil

2473.48 --> 2478.2
from it so it was never supposed to be

2475.319 --> 2479.88
consumed so you know like he would be

2478.2 --> 2482.5989999999997
rolling around in his

2479.88 --> 2485.52
grave no it's different true no it's

2482.599 --> 2486.8
it's complicated you see there's like

2485.52 --> 2489.68
okay

2486.8 --> 2492.319
soy this is this is just weird and this

2489.68 --> 2494.2
is like all about industrial Perfection

2492.319 --> 2495.88
or get being sloppy about it because if

2494.2 --> 2500.0789999999997
you take the entire

2495.88 --> 2502.7200000000003
soy then you get the core which is like

2500.079 --> 2505.6400000000003
pure estrogen that's the core is the

2502.72 --> 2506.9599999999996
estrogen they use the the core of soy

2505.64 --> 2509.7599999999998
for old

2506.96 --> 2513.359
ladies yeah to get that's why get the

2509.76 --> 2515.599
boy but the outside the fleshy part

2513.359 --> 2517.4
that's the protein and that is actually

2515.599 --> 2520.56
pretty good stuff stuff and that's also

2517.4 --> 2523.96
what they use for soy sauce and all that

2520.56 --> 2526.96
and for food but here's the thing if

2523.96 --> 2529.88
it's not is it industrially processed

2526.96 --> 2532.88
and not like by hand very carefully well

2529.88 --> 2535.88
then some of the inner core might slip

2532.88 --> 2537.88
out in the outside and yeah and that's

2535.88 --> 2539.88
what happens yeah and if you're eating

2537.88 --> 2543.1600000000003
it in abundance that's how that's you

2539.88 --> 2546.599
start realizing yeah proper soy should

2543.16 --> 2549.68
actually all be hand done and then you

2546.599 --> 2551.079
don't have those issues at all the pro

2549.68 --> 2552.839
the person doing it might have the

2551.079 --> 2555.0
issues because he's continually having

2552.839 --> 2556.4
those cores in his hands and all that

2555.0 --> 2558.0
but well I don't mess with it I just

2556.4 --> 2561.6800000000003
leave it alone once I read up on that

2558.0 --> 2564.559
yeah no I avoid it too but that's in in

2561.68 --> 2568.2
supermarkets right yeah if somebody be

2564.559 --> 2570.48
like I have soy in my garden and I make

2568.2 --> 2572.96
it then I take a look at how they're

2570.48 --> 2574.559
doing it and if they're doing it right

2572.96 --> 2577.44
then it's like yeah I'll take that

2574.559 --> 2580.28
that's great right mhm M but if it's

2577.44 --> 2582.4
like in a can or in some preap

2580.28 --> 2585.3590000000004
Supermarket thing I'm like

2582.4 --> 2587.6800000000003
no at least of that is possible please

2585.359 --> 2590.319
me ask because even if it's organic it's

2587.68 --> 2592.839
like yeah but how well how carefully is

2590.319 --> 2594.359
it actually processed so what about when

2592.839 --> 2597.0
you go into like a produce section where

2594.359 --> 2598.839
they sell you know llama beans or pinto

2597.0 --> 2600.2
beans whatever and they have soy beans

2598.839 --> 2601.7999999999997
in the bag you know that come in the bag

2600.2 --> 2603.24
and they're dried or whatever that's

2601.8 --> 2606.28
that's pretty safe that's pretty good to

2603.24 --> 2608.2799999999997
use you think those have been um soy

2606.28 --> 2610.52
manufactured right what would wouldn't

2608.28 --> 2613.7200000000003
they come wouldn't soybeans come in

2610.52 --> 2618.28
aren't there things called soybeans or

2613.72 --> 2621.5589999999997
soy I don't know I don't know about that

2618.28 --> 2623.44
okay so what is is soy a I didn't know

2621.559 --> 2625.8390000000004
they were constru of soy what is a

2623.44 --> 2628.319
construct of soy is it is it a powdery

2625.839 --> 2629.7999999999997
thing a liquidy thing is it a a bean

2628.319 --> 2632.319
with you know I thought it was like a

2629.8 --> 2634.28
grown Bean or something a bean right

2632.319 --> 2636.16
yeah so you can actually buy a bag like

2634.28 --> 2640.119
Lama of beans you could buy a bag of soy

2636.16 --> 2642.24
be it's like a you have to like H I

2640.119 --> 2645.1600000000003
don't know man I've never actually grown

2642.24 --> 2647.319
it now I'm embarrassed because I should

2645.16 --> 2650.48
probably just like actually look into

2647.319 --> 2653.319
the rudiment of it but from what I heard

2650.48 --> 2655.839
there was a this is just the word of

2653.319 --> 2658.48
mouth through the social media about it

2655.839 --> 2660.88
the core has all this estrogen it is

2658.48 --> 2662.64
being used medically and the outside has

2660.88 --> 2665.4
the protein I don't know if that's the

2662.64 --> 2668.64
Bean or if that's like the plant that

2665.4 --> 2671.0
grows out of be I'm not entirely sure

2668.64 --> 2672.92
right and in social media one of the

2671.0 --> 2675.44
reason one of the red flags that went up

2672.92 --> 2677.4
many many years ago when it was the

2675.44 --> 2681.4
thing for a meat supplement was there

2677.4 --> 2684.319
was a you know a particular um recording

2681.4 --> 2686.52
artist SL actor I ain't gonna say drop

2684.319 --> 2689.72
his name who's related to another very

2686.52 --> 2693.96
famous his sister's a very famous um

2689.72 --> 2695.5589999999997
actress and um who had her own comedic

2693.96 --> 2698.44
sitcom series and she had some hit

2695.559 --> 2700.44
records out and um it was reported that

2698.44 --> 2701.839
you know he was dealing with that and he

2700.44 --> 2703.359
was putting it out there to the people

2701.839 --> 2705.5589999999997
that you know that this is what his

2703.359 --> 2707.359
doctor told him so it was like he was he

2705.559 --> 2709.28
used his platform to tell everybody stay

2707.359 --> 2712.72
away from the soy or you going to have

2709.28 --> 2713.8390000000004
these and you know so he had to that and

2712.72 --> 2714.9599999999996
I guess they gave him some kind of

2713.839 --> 2717.2
steroids or whatever I don't know what

2714.96 --> 2719.7200000000003
they gave he got it right but it's

2717.2 --> 2722.1189999999997
mostly like especially the the processed

2719.72 --> 2726.2799999999997
stuff so the more processed something is

2722.119 --> 2729.96
like soy oil that could never be good

2726.28 --> 2733.92
right yeah yeah but if it's like like

2729.96 --> 2738.2
here is the plant like fresh out of the

2733.92 --> 2740.2000000000003
out of the ground you process it then

2738.2 --> 2744.48
yeah if you know how to do it that could

2740.2 --> 2747.359
probably be very doable even tasty yeah

2744.48 --> 2750.04
and back on the Cannabis topic now even

2747.359 --> 2753.64
though I grew up me personally I grew up

2750.04 --> 2757.359
around cannabis smokers okay my pops did

2753.64 --> 2759.8799999999997
um his friends did uh my my my aunts and

2757.359 --> 2762.359
uncles did well his brothers and sisters

2759.88 --> 2765.2400000000002
you know U not not too many not too many

2762.359 --> 2767.2799999999997
that on my mom's side but on his side um

2765.24 --> 2768.8799999999997
as a matter of fact I remember now that

2767.28 --> 2770.48
I look back at him we laughed about it

2768.88 --> 2771.6400000000003
before he passed away and my mother

2770.48 --> 2773.119
laughed about it and she pretty much

2771.64 --> 2774.24
wanted to knock them across the head

2773.119 --> 2776.2000000000003
once we start you know you get to a

2774.24 --> 2777.5989999999997
certain age you start communicating more

2776.2 --> 2779.8799999999997
with your parents because you're now in

2777.599 --> 2781.7200000000003
your 30s you know there and there yeah

2779.88 --> 2783.2400000000002
know all about it you know what I mean

2781.72 --> 2784.839
so then she you know so she was very

2783.24 --> 2786.5589999999997
appalled but she laughed along with it

2784.839 --> 2789.5589999999997
but I could tell you she wanted to stab

2786.559 --> 2793.2000000000003
him in the back I remember me being his

2789.559 --> 2795.599
his ounce and pound trafficker taking it

2793.2 --> 2797.7999999999997
back and forth to my uncle philli one of

2795.599 --> 2800.4
his best friends who was a DJ and I

2797.8 --> 2802.119
remember having a bag and I knew what

2800.4 --> 2803.7200000000003
was going in there but I didn't know

2802.119 --> 2805.52
that it was bad to do that I just

2803.72 --> 2808.2
thought I was doing a favor for Dad and

2805.52 --> 2809.839
I would make me $ 20 $50 so I looked

2808.2 --> 2813.72
back and I was like I was actually a

2809.839 --> 2815.52
carrier okay now as far as indulging in

2813.72 --> 2817.7999999999997
h i was that type of person that while

2815.52 --> 2820.68
every body was puff puff passing all I

2817.8 --> 2823.88
needed was maybe four Puffs and I was

2820.68 --> 2826.9199999999996
good cuz if I had any more I didn't want

2823.88 --> 2829.88
to go outside it hit me with paranoia

2826.92 --> 2832.079
and anxiety so I never really enjoyed I

2829.88 --> 2834.2000000000003
would be you know because it was like

2832.079 --> 2837.8390000000004
let's go to the store now get all our

2834.2 --> 2839.48
Munchies now because if we do this yeah

2837.839 --> 2842.44
I'm not going yeah you have to be

2839.48 --> 2845.0
prepared or yeah or you're getting wacky

2842.44 --> 2846.8
situations or an accident yeah then you

2845.0 --> 2849.0
and you start you start thinking you

2846.8 --> 2850.44
hearing saying somebody say something or

2849.0 --> 2852.04
looking at you a certain way you start

2850.44 --> 2853.44
getting paranoid especially if you

2852.04 --> 2855.5589999999997
especially I never like doing around

2853.44 --> 2857.88
strangers somebody unless it was women

2855.559 --> 2860.0400000000004
women I never had a paranoid feeling I

2857.88 --> 2862.44
always felt comfortable around women but

2860.04 --> 2864.2
when I about guys it was always like in

2862.44 --> 2865.76
my mind like yo why is he looking at me

2864.2 --> 2869.2
like that you know what I'm saying like

2865.76 --> 2871.3590000000004
yo like you know what's up yo and it was

2869.2 --> 2873.52
like nothing a dude and a dude knows how

2871.359 --> 2875.839
to hold his better than mine so they be

2873.52 --> 2879.359
like yo get your boy get your boy cuz

2875.839 --> 2881.24
bugging so it became like a a joke on me

2879.359 --> 2882.7599999999998
like n don't don't give they used to

2881.24 --> 2884.04
call me Chief Cherokee there's a don't

2882.76 --> 2885.6400000000003
don't give Cherokee don't give don't

2884.04 --> 2886.839
give him anything because he start

2885.64 --> 2889.04
bugging out but I'm like let me get a

2886.839 --> 2891.52
couple let me get a couple but I really

2889.04 --> 2895.319
didn't like it now Edibles Edibles don't

2891.52 --> 2897.599
do that to me Edibles didn't do that to

2895.319 --> 2899.44
me when Edibles came out and I in Doge

2897.599 --> 2902.559
it didn't do that to me but I can't

2899.44 --> 2904.44
stand and plus me being a singer the

2902.559 --> 2905.92
smoking thing wasn't cool anyway

2904.44 --> 2907.28
especially when they started I don't

2905.92 --> 2909.2000000000003
what they do in Amsterdam but they have

2907.28 --> 2911.28
these things called cigar blunts that

2909.2 --> 2912.72
they roll up in these cigar leaves so

2911.28 --> 2914.76
you know when you have Cigar leaves

2912.72 --> 2916.7599999999998
you're not supposed to inhale cigar Leaf

2914.76 --> 2919.0
you're supposed to Puff taste blow it

2916.76 --> 2920.96
out no inhalation well think about it

2919.0 --> 2924.0
when you're smoking a blunt with a

2920.96 --> 2927.48
whether it be a owl leaf or any type of

2924.0 --> 2929.44
high level upgraded leaf or whatever and

2927.48 --> 2931.88
you rolling up the the Cannabis in it

2929.44 --> 2934.88
you're inhaling that leaf not only did

2931.88 --> 2937.1600000000003
that can that cause um intoxication to

2934.88 --> 2939.2400000000002
your to your gums in your mouth for a

2937.16 --> 2941.839
normal cigar smoker but now you inhaling

2939.24 --> 2943.4399999999996
it so I had to I had to you know I

2941.839 --> 2946.16
pretty much just wean my way away from

2943.44 --> 2949.0
it it's not it's not cool I didn't know

2946.16 --> 2951.5589999999997
that about cigars but I know was never

2949.0 --> 2955.48
really into cigars anyway like I use

2951.559 --> 2958.3590000000004
very thin paper hem yeah you use hem

2955.48 --> 2962.4
yeah well that's why my father did I

2958.359 --> 2964.96
it's just a super super thin paper mhm

2962.4 --> 2968.44
this all my father this thin oh there's

2964.96 --> 2971.319
a hole in by the way but like this is

2968.44 --> 2974.04
it's almost completely

2971.319 --> 2976.16
transparent right like that's the the

2974.04 --> 2977.319
type of thin paper how the hell did the

2976.16 --> 2980.319
hole get in

2977.319 --> 2982.68
there see that's it we used to have one

2980.319 --> 2985.04
called bamboo or either easy wider and

2982.68 --> 2986.9199999999996
it was hem sheets now that's how my

2985.04 --> 2988.799
father told me if you ever do it this is

2986.92 --> 2990.4
how you smoke it don't ever smoke with

2988.799 --> 2991.839
them the way them young boys are doing

2990.4 --> 2993.04
because they you know they messing

2991.839 --> 2997.2
themselves

2993.04 --> 2999.359
up yeah I can't I don't TR trust

2997.2 --> 3001.04
Edibles

2999.359 --> 3004.44
because

3001.04 --> 3006.52
like you don't really know like like

3004.44 --> 3008.44
what it's like medical I'm talking about

3006.52 --> 3010.319
medicinal I'm talking I only get it from

3008.44 --> 3012.839
people that I know like there's like I

3010.319 --> 3015.52
don't even mess with it anymore but um

3012.839 --> 3018.48
like there was a girl I knew that had um

3015.52 --> 3021.48
some type of nervous like a nerve ending

3018.48 --> 3024.0
there's a specific nerve ending painful

3021.48 --> 3026.64
disease that's that that um that just

3024.0 --> 3028.16
makes people have this severe pain and

3026.64 --> 3033.52
they have to take care same oh the same

3028.16 --> 3035.92
thing that um um Montel Williams the

3033.52 --> 3037.64
retired Navy guy that had a show in the

3035.92 --> 3040.6800000000003
United States he deals with it people

3037.64 --> 3042.72
that have like Ms um right and it's

3040.68 --> 3045.04
another it's another neurolog

3042.72 --> 3046.64
neurological thing that caused people

3045.04 --> 3048.4
pain in their nerve endings all over

3046.64 --> 3049.799
their body just feels like their body

3048.4 --> 3051.7200000000003
you know how your leg go to sleep you

3049.799 --> 3054.44
feel the needles they feel that all over

3051.72 --> 3056.839
their body for some reason so she used

3054.44 --> 3059.16
medicinal um and that's why I got it

3056.839 --> 3061.599
from her cuz she made her own from her

3059.16 --> 3065.3999999999996
oils that she got yeah but that's is

3061.599 --> 3068.48
that like the raw with the THC and all

3065.4 --> 3069.88
that because I think that's mostly CBD

3068.48 --> 3071.76
that really works with that sort of

3069.88 --> 3074.44
thing there you go exactly that's an

3071.76 --> 3077.6400000000003
extract that's you don't normally make

3074.44 --> 3080.0
that yourself right because you it then

3077.64 --> 3082.48
it adds THC and that's what gets you

3080.0 --> 3085.0
high it's the CBD that just does healing

3082.48 --> 3086.76
stuff exactly they got it you can rub it

3085.0 --> 3088.92
on your KNE on your joints whenever you

3086.76 --> 3092.88
have pain but no she would give me some

3088.92 --> 3094.599
she had levels of THC in it to give you

3092.88 --> 3096.4
that you know sleeping and resting type

3094.599 --> 3098.6400000000003
of thing but um it never gave me the

3096.4 --> 3102.04
paranoia and it never overwhelmed me it

3098.64 --> 3105.319
just made me relax so it never never was

3102.04 --> 3108.88
a fan of mine um cannabis never will be

3105.319 --> 3114.88
and then I'd never forget

3108.88 --> 3116.319
um smoking from a um a pipe you know it

3114.88 --> 3118.599
wasn't from from the cigar or from the

3116.319 --> 3120.2
paper you use but from a pipe you know a

3118.599 --> 3124.52
real pipe like you could smoke anything

3120.2 --> 3126.96
Tobacco on and um my nephew in-law

3124.52 --> 3129.04
shared some with me and it was my

3126.96 --> 3130.559
birthday so everybody came down we was

3129.04 --> 3132.319
having a big birthday bash and it was

3130.559 --> 3135.559
like early in that Saturday before that

3132.319 --> 3137.5589999999997
party that night and um I guess I'm I'm

3135.559 --> 3140.44
trying to make it a compilation of

3137.559 --> 3143.0
having an empty stomach um on top of

3140.44 --> 3146.2400000000002
just waking up because he's one of those

3143.0 --> 3150.079
get up early sunrise throughout the day

3146.24 --> 3152.839
type of smokers so I just took two Puffs

3150.079 --> 3154.559
man it tore me up I mean tore me up I'm

3152.839 --> 3156.44
talking about tore me up in every way

3154.559 --> 3157.8390000000004
where I got sick to the stomach which my

3156.44 --> 3160.2400000000002
wife explained to me being a nurse for

3157.839 --> 3162.799
15 years she said well your stomach you

3160.24 --> 3164.319
know it made your stomach kind of turn

3162.799 --> 3165.44
over because the nerve endings and

3164.319 --> 3167.72
everything's got you know so you got

3165.44 --> 3171.16
that's nervous flare then you get the

3167.72 --> 3172.7599999999998
over tension that's what I get sometimes

3171.16 --> 3175.24
on my show and all that it's like

3172.76 --> 3179.3190000000004
nervous tension get it in the stomach

3175.24 --> 3182.7599999999998
coffee makes that happen a lot with me

3179.319 --> 3184.319
in the morning I went up and you know

3182.76 --> 3186.3190000000004
they made breakfast I had my eggs I

3184.319 --> 3189.0
couldn't hold my eggs in I I was

3186.319 --> 3191.7599999999998
literally almost in a coma sleeping in

3189.0 --> 3193.48
in my chair just tired just could you

3191.76 --> 3194.6400000000003
know I was like they was like you gonna

3193.48 --> 3196.48
be all right for the radar I said I'll

3194.64 --> 3197.92
be all right and then I just felt queasy

3196.48 --> 3200.76
ran upstairs and threw up twice and I

3197.92 --> 3204.48
went to sleep woke up the woke up later

3200.76 --> 3206.6400000000003
on lit I was ready but that little bit

3204.48 --> 3208.52
right there just made me and from since

3206.64 --> 3211.1189999999997
then I have not even touched it matter

3208.52 --> 3212.599
of fact when I see someone doing it I

3211.119 --> 3215.96
get sick to my

3212.599 --> 3219.76
stomach with what if I see someone doing

3215.96 --> 3223.76
it yeah but doing what smoking on TV in

3219.76 --> 3225.96
a movie I regular cigarettes no no no no

3223.76 --> 3228.3190000000004
any yeah literally anything but actually

3225.96 --> 3231.119
weed if I see someone or hear somebody

3228.319 --> 3233.92
say or even imply that they're passing

3231.119 --> 3235.28
around weed and smoking it I literally

3233.92 --> 3237.16
have this almost almost like somebody

3235.28 --> 3239.0
hypnotized me and I didn't know and did

3237.16 --> 3241.1189999999997
a session on me and said every time you

3239.0 --> 3242.799
see it or smell it or be around it

3241.119 --> 3244.04
you're going to get sick that's how I

3242.799 --> 3246.319
get right now yeah that's the

3244.04 --> 3248.5589999999997
associative reflex that's terrible there

3246.319 --> 3250.599
you go thank you you can get rid of that

3248.559 --> 3252.559
by the way if you want I don't want to

3250.599 --> 3256.0
get rid of it I don't I don't care to I

3252.559 --> 3259.28
don't care to I'm glad I'm glad yeah I

3256.0 --> 3261.839
think my brother has that too but he

3259.28 --> 3263.6800000000003
never wanted into that he like tried it

3261.839 --> 3266.68
once got sick of it and then never want

3263.68 --> 3268.8799999999997
to try it again Associated discomfort

3266.68 --> 3270.9199999999996
that's what you said that's what it's

3268.88 --> 3272.96
called n

3270.92 --> 3276.88
yeah it's like

3272.96 --> 3278.88
a you just keep you just remember

3276.88 --> 3280.92
something how it went bad and that's

3278.88 --> 3283.48
like how you how your body starts to

3280.92 --> 3286.48
associate that gotcha okay it's like

3283.48 --> 3288.559
associative reflex right is what I call

3286.48 --> 3290.28
it it's not an official name it's just

3288.559 --> 3291.559
oh okay yeah but I like that I like that

3290.28 --> 3295.52
term because that's definitely what it

3291.559 --> 3297.1600000000003
is I can't stand saying it uh and if I

3295.52 --> 3299.68
smell it like if you go to a concert you

3297.16 --> 3303.319
go somewhere or you nowadays in the

3299.68 --> 3305.44
United States and then accept right so

3303.319 --> 3309.079
you're not coming to Amsterdam anytime

3305.44 --> 3309.079
soon then oh

3309.44 --> 3314.319
no hold on hold on let me let me let me

3311.64 --> 3316.799
see if I no I don't need to get

3314.319 --> 3320.0389999999998
that I don't know they can leave a

3316.799 --> 3322.48
message but

3320.039 --> 3323.76
um yeah so I don't need to be doing that

3322.48 --> 3326.88
anyway man you

3323.76 --> 3328.2000000000003
know right yeah I have that associative

3326.88 --> 3331.839
reflex

3328.2 --> 3333.9199999999996
now now I don't have it really I had it

3331.839 --> 3336.5589999999997
yeah it's just every time something goes

3333.92 --> 3338.92
wrong you get that if it really goes

3336.559 --> 3341.92
wrong and you really pushed

3338.92 --> 3343.839
it and then it happens that then you can

3341.92 --> 3346.44
get that reflex but you can't get rid of

3343.839 --> 3350.52
it if you want to you have to basically

3346.44 --> 3352.48
work through it until it like goes

3350.52 --> 3354.28
away well fortunately you don't have

3352.48 --> 3355.2
that with sugar because other than that

3354.28 --> 3356.88
every time you get around around

3355.2 --> 3358.9199999999996
something sweet you'd want to start

3356.88 --> 3361.96
smacking people or poking them

3358.92 --> 3364.039
right or you would feel bad that you I

3361.96 --> 3367.039
don't even get to that point anymore

3364.039 --> 3369.039
like I can't get there like it's just

3367.039 --> 3371.48
like I could have been like I when I was

3369.039 --> 3373.8390000000004
young I would be hyper it up and then I

3371.48 --> 3376.839
get like a little devil like

3373.839 --> 3380.119
that but I can't really get to that

3376.839 --> 3382.68
State anymore and by chugging sugar like

3380.119 --> 3385.44
I'd get sick way before i' get to that

3382.68 --> 3387.72
part like if I get too much sugar I

3385.44 --> 3392.559
probably like I'd throw it

3387.72 --> 3396.64
up I'd feel like oh too much sugar eject

3392.559 --> 3398.1600000000003
eject it's like that right right right I

3396.64 --> 3401.4
got

3398.16 --> 3404.8799999999997
you and I've had that by the

3401.4 --> 3408.559
way like if I just like don't really pay

3404.88 --> 3411.119
attention to like how How Sweet It Is or

3408.559 --> 3414.4
and also like it does also happen like

3411.119 --> 3417.119
when I'm really hungry and then I eat

3414.4 --> 3419.839
something that that's too sweet that has

3417.119 --> 3423.48
like a terrible effect on me like that

3419.839 --> 3425.24
hurts now you know what that I I do I

3423.48 --> 3426.799
think everybody has a physiological

3425.24 --> 3428.5989999999997
reaction to eating too many sweets

3426.799 --> 3433.96
because I do I don't have the pancreatic

3428.599 --> 3437.3590000000004
pain but I do feel like a a like a

3433.96 --> 3439.64
uncomfortable like sensation of I don't

3437.359 --> 3442.4
know it's not a queasy feeling but it's

3439.64 --> 3446.48
a feeling of something overwhelming

3442.4 --> 3448.64
me um

3446.48 --> 3450.52
it's like you're being poisoned there

3448.64 --> 3452.1189999999997
you go exactly and it's like you can't

3450.52 --> 3454.2
get rid of it and guess what but I'm G

3452.119 --> 3457.44
tell you what to do this is what I do to

3454.2 --> 3461.2
take care of it drink plenty of water

3457.44 --> 3463.2400000000002
which is not um you know surprisingly

3461.2 --> 3466.0389999999998
because the water for some reason the

3463.24 --> 3468.64
water literally dilutes the strength of

3466.039 --> 3470.3190000000004
that poisonous feeling I drink a lot of

3468.64 --> 3474.48
water yeah but then you still have it in

3470.319 --> 3476.4
your system yeah but I pee it out no but

3474.48 --> 3478.28
yeah that doesn't work that way the

3476.4 --> 3479.599
Sugar's got to it's got to be processed

3478.28 --> 3482.079
in your body and then you're going to

3479.599 --> 3485.079
have that impact like when I get that

3482.079 --> 3488.0
feeling I'm going to throw it up okay

3485.079 --> 3490.48
like I'm like okay that means it's

3488.0 --> 3493.599
basically just a preliminary warning you

3490.48 --> 3495.68
see it's like this is so bad if you're

3493.599 --> 3497.44
going to choose to let this sink then

3495.68 --> 3499.68
your body's actually going to get the

3497.44 --> 3503.079
punishment from this because it's just a

3499.68 --> 3505.64
preliminary warning thing it's like oh

3503.079 --> 3508.119
oh too much too much can't handle that

3505.64 --> 3511.0389999999998
you're going to have a problem so that

3508.119 --> 3513.319
you still have a choice right you can

3511.039 --> 3518.28
still eject

3513.319 --> 3519.68
it yeah strange way to describe it but

3518.28 --> 3522.28
yeah that's

3519.68 --> 3525.24
true yeah your body has a way of warning

3522.28 --> 3528.559
you right because I've been like I oops

3525.24 --> 3530.7599999999998
I've ate myself like really almost into

3528.559 --> 3533.4
a coma with sugar at times when I was a

3530.76 --> 3536.92
kid like on Saturday morning cartoon

3533.4 --> 3538.839
time and then just like yeah I want to

3536.92 --> 3540.799
eat this and that and that and then I

3538.839 --> 3543.7599999999998
just like start chugging all of it and

3540.799 --> 3545.96
it's like that's three bags of sweets

3543.76 --> 3549.44
like no

3545.96 --> 3552.119
okay now now now and then eventually I

3549.44 --> 3554.079
learned to like eject eject just threw

3552.119 --> 3556.6800000000003
it up and then my parents were like what

3554.079 --> 3558.2000000000003
the hell are you doing they okay they

3556.68 --> 3559.72
thought you were one of those um

3558.2 --> 3562.4399999999996
anorexic

3559.72 --> 3565.3999999999996
bulimic yeah well I was almost bulimic

3562.44 --> 3567.92
with candy yeah cuz it's just like I

3565.4 --> 3571.039
want to just like I want to swim in this

3567.92 --> 3573.48
stuff but I just get poisoned every time

3571.039 --> 3575.599
props to my parents we weren't candy

3573.48 --> 3578.119
eaters I didn't have my first cabin

3575.599 --> 3580.28
until I was 26 years old oh wow it

3578.119 --> 3582.2000000000003
wasn't like it wasn't like I was one of

3580.28 --> 3583.8390000000004
those brush in the morning brush in the

3582.2 --> 3584.8799999999997
afternoon brush in the evening I was one

3583.839 --> 3586.72
of them type of people you know what I'm

3584.88 --> 3588.6800000000003
saying I just I took care my teeth you

3586.72 --> 3590.24
know but yeah it was it may have been as

3588.68 --> 3592.2
a child I'm pretty I might have went

3590.24 --> 3594.1189999999997
through a day or two without brushing or

3592.2 --> 3597.1189999999997
you know you're just playing around but

3594.119 --> 3599.88
anyway we were never the type that had

3597.119 --> 3602.7200000000003
now we may have peppermints like those

3599.88 --> 3605.319
white solid mints maybe guess but we

3602.72 --> 3607.2799999999997
never we never had bowls of M&M peanuts

3605.319 --> 3608.839
or any type of sweets we were never

3607.28 --> 3611.52
given

3608.839 --> 3614.0789999999997
sweets but still you can get that same

3611.52 --> 3616.359
sugar from other things so my problem

3614.079 --> 3621.96
has always been

3616.359 --> 3625.24
pastries Donuts jelly fil Donuts cakes

3621.96 --> 3629.559
um you know hostes any thing that had to

3625.24 --> 3632.8799999999997
do with with with pastry was my problem

3629.559 --> 3634.6800000000003
and I I've always been a fan as a child

3632.88 --> 3638.7200000000003
of peanut butter and jelly

3634.68 --> 3640.2
sandwiches so so I so so that's how I so

3638.72 --> 3643.2799999999997
you're a regular

3640.2 --> 3646.72
Hans H and grle pretty much right

3643.28 --> 3649.039
exactly you're like that gotta get it

3646.72 --> 3650.8799999999997
but as far yeah as far as Skittles you

3649.039 --> 3652.6400000000003
know things like that especially you

3650.88 --> 3653.92
know maybe you know once in a while we

3652.64 --> 3655.0
had a thing we I don't know if youall

3653.92 --> 3657.44
know you're familiar with with it they

3655.0 --> 3660.319
were called now or lers they were like

3657.44 --> 3662.64
taffy candies yeah but all the names in

3660.319 --> 3664.64
America with candy and pastri are

3662.64 --> 3667.4
completely different from what it was in

3664.64 --> 3670.7599999999998
Europe so yeah you got your Jolly

3667.4 --> 3673.52
Ranchers now lers and they were more of

3670.76 --> 3676.3190000000004
the um sucking pallette upper pallet

3673.52 --> 3678.0
sucking candies Starburst you don't chew

3676.319 --> 3679.24
these cuz these these are very Taffy and

3678.0 --> 3680.44
you don't want to get them caught in

3679.24 --> 3681.839
your molders because that's how you get

3680.44 --> 3683.799
the cavities so there's a certain

3681.839 --> 3685.24
technique in eating certain candies yeah

3683.799 --> 3687.559
yeah yeah c candy yeah you know what I

3685.24 --> 3689.4799999999996
mean so do you have jaw breakers those

3687.559 --> 3692.6800000000003
things oh I don't yeah we had those with

3689.48 --> 3694.68
those super hot oh yeah I remember those

3692.68 --> 3696.0789999999997
man those were terrible but I love them

3694.68 --> 3698.2799999999997
no no no no no you know what those are

3696.079 --> 3700.599
great for when you got older before you

3698.28 --> 3702.76
going to meet up with a girl or let's

3700.599 --> 3705.6400000000003
say you were drinking with the buddies

3702.76 --> 3708.4
and you wanted to cover your breath bro

3705.64 --> 3711.16
those red hot ones that cinnamon or that

3708.4 --> 3713.0
fire that smell right out your breath

3711.16 --> 3716.3999999999996
and you smell like oh your breath smells

3713.0 --> 3718.92
so good well if you like cinnamon that

3716.4 --> 3721.64
is yeah yeah yeah well I mean you know

3718.92 --> 3723.52
some people really hate that they don't

3721.64 --> 3726.0789999999997
like the

3723.52 --> 3727.559
spice you just have Yuck Mouth then

3726.079 --> 3729.799
that's how I looked at I rather have the

3727.559 --> 3731.079
pain of the Jaws burnt up rather than to

3729.799 --> 3732.88
have yuck mouth and then the girl go

3731.079 --> 3734.92
tell the guy you know he's cute but his

3732.88 --> 3736.88
breath smell like a foot I don't want

3734.92 --> 3741.559
that I have no idea what you're talking

3736.88 --> 3743.88
about I was not very kissy oh I mean I

3741.559 --> 3745.96
tried but like that kind of stopped

3743.88 --> 3749.599
after I was

3745.96 --> 3752.039
12 weirdly enough

3749.599 --> 3755.559
stopped yeah I just got I just got

3752.039 --> 3759.6400000000003
rolling when I was 12 and I mean N I got

3755.559 --> 3762.1600000000003
awkward and nerdy oh okay I got you not

3759.64 --> 3763.96
that I I wanted to it just didn't really

3762.16 --> 3766.279
work like when I was younger I was

3763.96 --> 3769.4
really like a much more like almost like

3766.279 --> 3771.52
an alpha like when I was a little kid

3769.4 --> 3773.96
but then like I figured out how [ __ ]

3771.52 --> 3776.599
up the world is and like that yeah

3773.96 --> 3779.799
there's like an everlasting gamma is

3776.599 --> 3782.4
always attacking you if you act like

3779.799 --> 3785.0
complete so then I basically sort of

3782.4 --> 3787.64
broke and then I like was like okay I'm

3785.0 --> 3789.24
going to be the weirdo in the corner no

3787.64 --> 3791.92
it's not the weirdo I mean it ain't the

3789.24 --> 3793.7599999999998
weirdo you know it felt like that yeah

3791.92 --> 3796.2400000000002
Welly and I would be treated by all the

3793.76 --> 3800.96
gamas like that well well I'm G tell you

3796.24 --> 3803.8799999999997
this I'm not saying they are or have but

3800.96 --> 3806.559
because of your conservative whatever

3803.88 --> 3808.0
you call it introvert or intimidating I

3806.559 --> 3811.76
don't know what it is your temperament

3808.0 --> 3813.92
but most people like that not you most

3811.76 --> 3816.079
people like them that are very active

3813.92 --> 3818.6800000000003
like that end up being parents before

3816.079 --> 3819.92
they supposed to be end up getting STDs

3818.68 --> 3822.16
and things like that so don't never feel

3819.92 --> 3823.92
sh I I've learned that never feel

3822.16 --> 3826.64
shameful for your conservativeness when

3823.92 --> 3828.559
it comes to sexual encounterment or any

3826.64 --> 3830.8799999999997
type of intimacy dude I was not

3828.559 --> 3833.88
conservative at all I'm talking about

3830.88 --> 3836.319
sharing B whether it be saliva or

3833.88 --> 3837.799
whatever you know what I'm saying but

3836.319 --> 3840.96
but I was going back to the kissing

3837.799 --> 3842.92
thing I remember there was a thing that

3840.96 --> 3845.279
we used to do where you practice on your

3842.92 --> 3846.7200000000003
arm you take your forearm and you put

3845.279 --> 3849.119
your forearm and act like the forearm is

3846.72 --> 3850.279
a face and when you say oh this is how

3849.119 --> 3852.0
you're supposed to kiss somebody and you

3850.279 --> 3854.4
show them you kiss your forearm this

3852.0 --> 3857.0
these are the things that we did Growing

3854.4 --> 3860.119
Up to practice so that when we did kiss

3857.0 --> 3861.839
a girl we knew how to not be too messy

3860.119 --> 3863.799
with the

3861.839 --> 3865.279
saliva so that they wouldn't they

3863.799 --> 3866.64
wouldn't you they wouldn't feel you know

3865.279 --> 3868.839
so we could be judged on the kissing cuz

3866.64 --> 3871.68
back then before you did went the third

3868.839 --> 3873.319
base of Home kissing was very important

3871.68 --> 3874.799
that the girls had to go back and brag

3873.319 --> 3876.799
to the other girls about so you had to

3874.799 --> 3878.559
make sure your game was tight because if

3876.799 --> 3880.88
it like if you clack teeth together

3878.559 --> 3882.1600000000003
that's a no no you don't clack teeth

3880.88 --> 3884.44
like I kissed this one girl named

3882.16 --> 3887.5989999999997
Suzanne she opened up her mouth so wide

3884.44 --> 3890.88
I thought she was gonna bite my

3887.599 --> 3892.6400000000003
entire right you know I was like but I

3890.88 --> 3894.88
guess that was her she didn't practice

3892.64 --> 3896.52
enough you know but um

3894.88 --> 3898.319
you just you know you gotta you know you

3896.52 --> 3900.64
got to you got to practice and then and

3898.319 --> 3903.0
then if you're fortunate to have like

3900.64 --> 3906.68
like your your parents have friends who

3903.0 --> 3908.2
have children and you know and y'all are

3906.68 --> 3909.839
playing in the back and y'all might have

3908.2 --> 3911.8799999999997
caught Mommy and Daddy kissing whatever

3909.839 --> 3914.96
and you know you sometimes kiss each

3911.88 --> 3916.6400000000003
other or whatever hey I mean that's part

3914.96 --> 3920.119
of growing up and everything long as you

3916.64 --> 3922.72
don't take it too far so it's all part

3920.119 --> 3925.6800000000003
of growing up and then one day you may

3922.72 --> 3929.279
be 14 15 years old and meet a girl

3925.68 --> 3933.0
that's 16 17 years old that may have

3929.279 --> 3935.359
been the home plate before and she can

3933.0 --> 3937.079
teach you a little bit of something and

3935.359 --> 3938.64
then you pay it for it you just pay it

3937.079 --> 3943.2400000000002
for

3938.64 --> 3946.279
it okay I missed out on all of that

3943.24 --> 3948.24
although what I was always like with it

3946.279 --> 3950.599
in my mind I was really like that

3948.24 --> 3952.5989999999997
awkward kid in the corner I really was

3950.599 --> 3954.3590000000004
like you can't compare it to what I'm

3952.599 --> 3958.2000000000003
now although I'm still kind of weird

3954.359 --> 3961.44
awkward but the thing is how I got over

3958.2 --> 3963.48
all that is like when I was 18 I

3961.44 --> 3965.96
basically there was a new girl in the

3963.48 --> 3968.599
class that came in from another school

3965.96 --> 3970.16
and I basically just made a move on it

3968.599 --> 3971.88
like there you go like it was always

3970.16 --> 3975.0789999999997
meant to be and

3971.88 --> 3977.279
like then I had also had sex with her

3975.079 --> 3978.92
and then I told her like oh yeah I was a

3977.279 --> 3981.799
Virgin by the way and she was all

3978.92 --> 3986.0
shocked and [ __ ] cuz I was basically

3981.799 --> 3986.0
like doing it like I was an exper

3986.319 --> 3990.5589999999997
that's just because I'm like I'm not

3988.48 --> 3994.839
going to [ __ ] tell you I'm a virgin

3990.559 --> 3997.599
screw you literally I am screwing

3994.839 --> 3999.16
you I'm not telling you I was a virgin

3997.599 --> 4001.319
I'm just going to do it

3999.16 --> 4002.839
right yeah you got you got sometimes you

4001.319 --> 4004.359
just have to

4002.839 --> 4008.0389999999998
um

4004.359 --> 4009.96
um a a Nike attitude just do it now

4008.039 --> 4014.279
don't get it twisted and it was weird

4009.96 --> 4017.7200000000003
too because she was like she didn't like

4014.279 --> 4020.96
it that that I was like she didn't want

4017.72 --> 4024.319
her to be like the Virgin like she

4020.96 --> 4026.44
didn't want me to be like the one to

4024.319 --> 4029.0
took my virginity but it's like what are

4026.44 --> 4031.039
you talking about that was apparently

4029.0 --> 4034.4
for a woman's perspective I was just

4031.039 --> 4038.4
like no I just succeeded you didn't even

4034.4 --> 4040.44
realize I was a virgin like I win what's

4038.4 --> 4042.64
the issue like you don't have to worry

4040.44 --> 4045.64
about being my first like you're good

4042.64 --> 4049.839
enough that's why I wanted to do it with

4045.64 --> 4053.799
you okay gocha and she's like a a smart

4049.839 --> 4058.5589999999997
interesting sensitive person ended up

4053.799 --> 4061.319
studying Theology and has a kid so was

4058.559 --> 4063.799
like a weird very Dutch

4061.319 --> 4065.599
person it's just like that was

4063.799 --> 4067.96
interesting it's like a person that's

4065.599 --> 4070.44
actually interesting with a complicated

4067.96 --> 4074.799
relationship with their family it's like

4070.44 --> 4077.68
yes it's exactly like me like me me it's

4074.799 --> 4079.4
like yes finally somebody that's like I

4077.68 --> 4081.9199999999996
feel kind of equal with did you have did

4079.4 --> 4084.2400000000002
you have did you have feelings for her

4081.92 --> 4086.76
or was it just physical oh no I loved

4084.24 --> 4089.0389999999998
her okay there you go that's why that's

4086.76 --> 4091.2000000000003
the because I'm not having like I I

4089.039 --> 4094.0
don't have sex with people I don't love

4091.2 --> 4095.72
because when I do I have done it maybe a

4094.0 --> 4097.04
couple of times but when I do it's like

4095.72 --> 4100.04
literally you're

4097.04 --> 4101.839
cursed it curses me when I do that I

4100.04 --> 4104.56
believe I believe that's why you

4101.839 --> 4107.239
performed like an experienced Pro

4104.56 --> 4109.679
because it's more than just a physical

4107.239 --> 4111.239
thing when you get when you get really

4109.679 --> 4113.88
good at it it can be just a physical

4111.239 --> 4118.5599999999995
thing but there's nothing like when you

4113.88 --> 4120.88
love the person and you indulge in it

4118.56 --> 4123.56
because it it's it's it's it's a

4120.88 --> 4127.839
combination of the physical and the

4123.56 --> 4129.359
emotional and you never you you you feel

4127.839 --> 4131.12
privileged you look in this person's

4129.359 --> 4133.6
face and you're like oh I love this

4131.12 --> 4134.5199999999995
person whereas when it's just a physical

4133.6 --> 4137.6
thing

4134.52 --> 4139.359
you only have one you only have one gear

4137.6 --> 4141.2390000000005
physical you dig what I'm saying you I'm

4139.359 --> 4143.64
saying if you will you have two gears

4141.239 --> 4146.599999999999
yeah but that it's not that gear is

4143.64 --> 4147.88
terrible because it curses you for me at

4146.6 --> 4150.400000000001
least no no no no no yeah know the

4147.88 --> 4153.12
physic and like I can feel it like even

4150.4 --> 4156.3589999999995
when you're in your relationship I can

4153.12 --> 4158.759
feel on the other side like if they're

4156.359 --> 4161.719
actually doing it For Love or if they're

4158.759 --> 4164.56
just using me I can feel that right

4161.719 --> 4167.56
right right and it always has

4164.56 --> 4170.64
consequences right so it's like for me

4167.56 --> 4173.92
it's like no it's it's

4170.64 --> 4177.08
mandatory like you have to love

4173.92 --> 4180.2390000000005
otherwise it's like love or no sex

4177.08 --> 4182.48
that's how it actually works for me got

4180.239 --> 4184.5199999999995
and that's how really passionate up and

4182.48 --> 4187.199
down relationships also work by the way

4184.52 --> 4188.64
because that's just natural it's like oh

4187.199 --> 4190.4
there's something terrible then you

4188.64 --> 4193.2390000000005
don't want anything to do with the

4190.4 --> 4195.199
person right you go away and you get in

4193.239 --> 4198.32
you get on each other's nerves and then

4195.199 --> 4201.08
it's like oh you get Beyond it or you

4198.32 --> 4203.599999999999
see something like like good of that

4201.08 --> 4205.64
person like overcoming an issue and then

4203.6 --> 4208.0
you're suddenly attracted again then you

4205.64 --> 4210.4400000000005
fall in love again it comes all back and

4208.0 --> 4213.92
then it's it works again and then you're

4210.44 --> 4216.0
not cursed right because it's all about

4213.92 --> 4218.4800000000005
it's not even about like what your

4216.0 --> 4221.6
religion it's like as long as you just

4218.48 --> 4223.44
do it with love literally like when you

4221.6 --> 4224.92
do it do it with love otherwise don't do

4223.44 --> 4227.04
it

4224.92 --> 4228.88
and and you know what and and and not to

4227.04 --> 4231.92
knock that because that is that should

4228.88 --> 4235.04
be highly put on the pedestal but that

4231.92 --> 4237.32
is that is quite rare and I commend it

4235.04 --> 4240.28
for men

4237.32 --> 4242.96
because we because men do all the damage

4240.28 --> 4247.12
when they don't and women become bitter

4242.96 --> 4249.52
and right and resentful against men if

4247.12 --> 4252.76
you don't exactly and that's why you

4249.52 --> 4254.2390000000005
have a lot of these issues over here um

4252.76 --> 4256.719
especially in the United un states with

4254.239 --> 4259.159
the me too movement which is you know

4256.719 --> 4262.4
and the feminist movement all these

4259.159 --> 4263.96
things because it's almost like um I'm

4262.4 --> 4266.4
not going to say how many cases but I'm

4263.96 --> 4269.159
going to say the vast majority of the

4266.4 --> 4272.679
cases even in an experience of myself

4269.159 --> 4274.879999999999
that um if you if you if you sign a if

4272.679 --> 4277.4400000000005
you sign a check that you can't cash and

4274.88 --> 4279.0
make a woman Scorn the repercussions can

4277.44 --> 4281.5199999999995
be so detrimental that you wouldn't

4279.0 --> 4286.08
believe it and whether you're an

4281.52 --> 4288.120000000001
aspiring actress and promised a role and

4286.08 --> 4289.64
you basically or either your girlfriends

4288.12 --> 4292.199
or yourself think the best way to get

4289.64 --> 4294.88
the role ahead of the other more more

4292.199 --> 4296.4
prepared and more talented is to do this

4294.88 --> 4298.52
to be able to get this role with this

4296.4 --> 4301.4
producer whether it be a film or music

4298.52 --> 4303.84
producer women do this thing and what

4301.4 --> 4305.638999999999
men do worse is if they sell them Pipe

4303.84 --> 4307.719
Dreams by telling them you're going to

4305.639 --> 4309.84
be the one or I'm going to get you on

4307.719 --> 4312.639
and then you don't do it yes you will

4309.84 --> 4316.56
have a Teresa Washington versus Mike

4312.639 --> 4318.639
Tyson well you don't steal from a devil

4316.56 --> 4321.400000000001
yeah you know if somebody's like

4318.639 --> 4325.159000000001
committing sin to do something and you

4321.4 --> 4326.96
then use that and steal that from that's

4325.159 --> 4330.638999999999
literally stealing from the devil

4326.96 --> 4333.28
they're going to [ __ ] you up you better

4330.639 --> 4336.04
if somebody's getting somewhere doing

4333.28 --> 4338.36
sin and you then steal that away from

4336.04 --> 4340.08
them that's literally like stealing from

4338.36 --> 4342.639
the devil they're going to [ __ ] you up

4340.08 --> 4344.48
because of that because they're already

4342.639 --> 4347.400000000001
sinning to get it

4344.48 --> 4349.678999999999
it's like y

4347.4 --> 4352.5599999999995
y and and see that's a lot of these

4349.679 --> 4354.4400000000005
cases so it's good that you Carri

4352.56 --> 4356.8
yourself you carried yourself in that

4354.44 --> 4360.159
manner where you kept it on the

4356.8 --> 4363.28
emotional side so that or I look at it

4360.159 --> 4368.04
on this side the way I did it it's

4363.28 --> 4371.159
either up front you establish it no

4368.04 --> 4375.08
strings attached you're attractive you

4371.159 --> 4378.599999999999
I'm attracted to you hey let's do this

4375.08 --> 4380.88
no promises no contracts no yeah but

4378.6 --> 4383.4800000000005
that's that's exploratory and that's

4380.88 --> 4386.400000000001
sort of hippie-ish and it can work it

4383.48 --> 4389.08
can also go terribly wrong at the end

4386.4 --> 4391.5199999999995
but then you know right it's at least an

4389.08 --> 4393.159
an honest attempt but that go but that

4391.52 --> 4394.719
goes back to what I said that goes back

4393.159 --> 4396.679
to what we talking about you know what

4394.719 --> 4398.08
goes bad on that when there is a mutual

4396.679 --> 4400.679
agreement verbally and then all of a

4398.08 --> 4402.4
sudden one of them breaches it and says

4400.679 --> 4406.2390000000005
like what's the what's the movie Fatal

4402.4 --> 4409.04
Attraction star in Douglas I mean him

4406.239 --> 4411.159
the lady knew he was married he knew she

4409.04 --> 4412.88
he had a family she was like cool that's

4411.159 --> 4415.159
all good but then she started catching

4412.88 --> 4417.08
feelings for him she was that single

4415.159 --> 4419.44
woman that wanted what that other woman

4417.08 --> 4422.12
had she was bearing she wanted to have a

4419.44 --> 4424.44
child she was tired of her career so she

4422.12 --> 4426.28
basically forfeited breached the

4424.44 --> 4429.12
contract and then started acting like a

4426.28 --> 4431.5599999999995
crazy fool so and this can go both ways

4429.12 --> 4433.96
men have done that men men men are the

4431.56 --> 4435.76
same way you know we just kicking it we

4433.96 --> 4437.0
just kicking it we just do and all of a

4435.76 --> 4438.12
sudden all of a sudden he start being

4437.0 --> 4440.08
controlled like you know I'm getting

4438.12 --> 4441.5599999999995
tired of you coming over here you know

4440.08 --> 4443.6
why you got to go him well he's my damn

4441.56 --> 4446.2390000000005
husband and the father you know so it

4443.6 --> 4448.0
goes both ways so the way you said it

4446.239 --> 4450.12
the way you said the way to be done is

4448.0 --> 4451.48
it should be done that way where if

4450.12 --> 4455.36
there's going to be a contingency be

4451.48 --> 4458.0
contingency on love loving commitment

4455.36 --> 4460.159
monogamy then you don't have to have any

4458.0 --> 4461.44
problems and that's the way I did it

4460.159 --> 4462.5199999999995
when I had a girlfriend I had a

4461.44 --> 4465.32
girlfriend when I didn't have a

4462.52 --> 4467.120000000001
girlfriend I had girl girls but when I

4465.32 --> 4469.32
had a girlfriend it was it that was my

4467.12 --> 4471.8
girlfriend period you know what I'm

4469.32 --> 4474.639
saying and we kept it like that until we

4471.8 --> 4476.8
just decided to have our space and then

4474.639 --> 4479.159000000001
I would have more than one you know what

4476.8 --> 4480.84
I'm saying but at least you you laid on

4479.159 --> 4482.92
the line you lay it on the line and keep

4480.84 --> 4485.32
it 100 if you keep it 100 with a female

4482.92 --> 4489.56
a female that is practical and logical

4485.32 --> 4491.96
has and has reasonable um you know uh uh

4489.56 --> 4493.2390000000005
um not selfish or whatever she's going

4491.96 --> 4496.52
to understand she's going to appre

4493.239 --> 4498.839999999999
appreciate that but do not never whether

4496.52 --> 4500.56
it be a woman or a man do not write a

4498.84 --> 4504.2390000000005
check you can't

4500.56 --> 4507.96
cash right don't try to steal love there

4504.239 --> 4510.32
you go don't do it because it is like

4507.96 --> 4512.679
it's like this sneaky grabler trick it's

4510.32 --> 4515.32
like if you make them fall in love with

4512.679 --> 4517.32
you they'll do more they'll show more of

4515.32 --> 4519.599999999999
their powers but if you just do it just

4517.32 --> 4522.199
to get that and then walk away that's

4519.6 --> 4525.719
stealing yep that's Ste that's really

4522.199 --> 4527.96
sick mhm a l sociopath that's what

4525.719 --> 4530.32
sociopaths do now now sometimes you

4527.96 --> 4532.639
can't help that person you just what

4530.32 --> 4536.239
they call it one night stands sometimes

4532.639 --> 4538.4400000000005
you can't help control yeah but one that

4536.239 --> 4540.5599999999995
person you met at the club and y'all go

4538.44 --> 4542.919999999999
in the bathroom and do it or go people

4540.56 --> 4546.719
go into an agreement before they do such

4542.92 --> 4547.92
a thing okay they usually do well

4546.719 --> 4549.84
sometimes there's no agreement it's just

4547.92 --> 4551.96
one of those yes agreement on taci and

4549.84 --> 4553.32
acquiescence it's like we know we we

4551.96 --> 4555.12
don't know each other we don't even know

4553.32 --> 4557.96
each other's middle initial but we like

4555.12 --> 4560.32
each other we have a physical attraction

4557.96 --> 4562.2390000000005
you do it bam right there it should be

4560.32 --> 4563.639
understood don't follow me now around

4562.239 --> 4566.678999999999
the

4563.639 --> 4569.88
club forget about it you dig what I'm

4566.679 --> 4575.2390000000005
saying I mean that never

4569.88 --> 4577.52
works that never works dude yeah that's

4575.239 --> 4579.759999999999
true like especially if you're

4577.52 --> 4582.320000000001
attractive if it's like okay we're at

4579.76 --> 4585.2390000000005
the sex club and we're all bit ugly but

4582.32 --> 4589.159
we pretend that yeah we're all super

4585.239 --> 4591.32
hunky and then yeah okay then I get it

4589.159 --> 4594.08
like they're not going to follow you

4591.32 --> 4597.04
around right right but I mean if you're

4594.08 --> 4600.36
actually attractive you can't expect

4597.04 --> 4603.08
that to happen right like if I have sex

4600.36 --> 4605.199
with a woman they're going to basically

4603.08 --> 4607.44
want to be my girlfriend I made this

4605.199 --> 4609.759999999999
mistake too right I I did that too with

4607.44 --> 4611.5599999999995
the the girl that I say was so ugly you

4609.76 --> 4615.159000000001
had to put a bag over had it didn't

4611.56 --> 4617.400000000001
actually do that I ended up wanting to

4615.159 --> 4620.679
love her and it just couldn't work it's

4617.4 --> 4623.638999999999
like no I couldn't make it physically

4620.679 --> 4625.4
work well I'm be even though she had

4623.639 --> 4628.52
attractive elements it just couldn't

4625.4 --> 4629.239
work and then I was basically I was in

4628.52 --> 4632.360000000001
the

4629.239 --> 4634.5599999999995
wrong yeah you try to find things and I

4632.36 --> 4637.4
did not blame her I like afterward

4634.56 --> 4638.159000000001
bumped into her at like a fair and I she

4637.4 --> 4640.759999999999
was

4638.159 --> 4642.759999999999
like and I'm like yeah I'm really sorry

4640.76 --> 4645.76
I'm really sorry I mean it I I feel

4642.76 --> 4647.08
really bad for the way I I I treated you

4645.76 --> 4650.12
and

4647.08 --> 4652.5599999999995
I I hope you'll be all right when you

4650.12 --> 4656.28
said you mean she looked like she

4652.56 --> 4658.4800000000005
was like like you hurt me a lot and like

4656.28 --> 4659.88
I'm becoming evil because of you or

4658.48 --> 4661.678999999999
something you she got uglier I thought

4659.88 --> 4663.4800000000005
you meant she got ugli no no no no no

4661.679 --> 4665.639
that's not really possible no it is

4663.48 --> 4668.199
possible but she

4665.639 --> 4670.92
didn't but you know that I'm saying I

4668.199 --> 4672.638999999999
condone it I was never that guy I was I

4670.92 --> 4674.4
was always that guy that if I met the

4672.639 --> 4676.679
girl we was attracted we started dancing

4674.4 --> 4678.32
and if we happened to have rendevu over

4676.679 --> 4680.4
in the car in the parking lot or in the

4678.32 --> 4681.92
bathroom or we went to the club or the

4680.4 --> 4683.759999999999
hotel she was staying at across from the

4681.92 --> 4685.92
club whatever she was going to be my

4683.76 --> 4688.639
girl for the night and if we kicked it

4685.92 --> 4690.28
and had much more fun she was going to

4688.639 --> 4691.2390000000005
be my friend and we was going to we was

4690.28 --> 4692.679
going to kick it later on we was going

4691.239 --> 4694.678999999999
to swap numbers that's how I was I

4692.679 --> 4697.08
wasn't to the point where I can just

4694.679 --> 4698.8
bang bang bang bang and then go out

4697.08 --> 4700.28
separate ways I wasn't I wasn't like

4698.8 --> 4701.320000000001
that I never you know it was never like

4700.28 --> 4703.44
that you

4701.32 --> 4705.12
know so

4703.44 --> 4706.759999999999
I know guys like that I know guys like

4705.12 --> 4709.04
that though I know guys that can do that

4706.76 --> 4711.12
and just move on and go to the next girl

4709.04 --> 4712.6
and leave that girl sitting at the bar

4711.12 --> 4714.679
and the next guy come up and say can I

4712.6 --> 4716.360000000001
buy a drink I mean I've seen it happen

4714.679 --> 4717.719
but I can't be that way especially if

4716.36 --> 4719.679
I'm physically attracted to I'm GNA try

4717.719 --> 4721.88
to find something else within them that

4719.679 --> 4723.76
I'm attracted to even if we like to both

4721.88 --> 4725.2390000000005
play the PlayStation anything you know

4723.76 --> 4726.6
what I'm saying because I want to kick

4725.239 --> 4729.48
it with you tonight I'd rather kick it

4726.6 --> 4732.04
with you then have to go around saying

4729.48 --> 4733.759999999999
hey hey you know you want to dance no

4732.04 --> 4734.679
you i' rather you know I ain't got time

4733.76 --> 4736.679
for

4734.679 --> 4738.4800000000005
that because rejection I don't like

4736.679 --> 4741.04
rejection most guys don't like rejection

4738.48 --> 4742.879999999999
so this how I battle rejection too this

4741.04 --> 4744.88
is the key go to the table where there's

4742.88 --> 4746.719
a bunch of them and look at them all the

4744.88 --> 4750.12
ugly to the prettiest and say any of you

4746.719 --> 4754.159
want to dance they love that they love

4750.12 --> 4757.48
that if you go to one and you ignore the

4754.159 --> 4759.5199999999995
others oh yeah they hate that yeah the

4757.48 --> 4762.04
other one is gonna kick her and be like

4759.52 --> 4763.92
no right or or she's gonna feel like you

4762.04 --> 4766.12
can't ask what why you coming at me so

4763.92 --> 4767.4800000000005
it's more than a dance you want me so

4766.12 --> 4769.28
don't make them feel like that let them

4767.48 --> 4771.678999999999
know that you came here to have a good

4769.28 --> 4773.28
time any of you ladies want to dance and

4771.679 --> 4774.96
do you know show you little Ry to them

4773.28 --> 4777.08
and if it's a song trust me and if the

4774.96 --> 4778.4
ugliest girl get up dance with her guess

4777.08 --> 4780.5599999999995
what the prettiest woman will be like

4778.4 --> 4784.799999999999
I'm GNA

4780.56 --> 4787.400000000001
[ __ ] trust that that's how it works

4784.8 --> 4788.719
that's how it works that's interesting

4787.4 --> 4791.199
yes the prettiest one is going to be

4788.719 --> 4792.52
like I'm G to because he's going to

4791.199 --> 4794.12
she's going to they going to see you as

4792.52 --> 4796.4800000000005
a d dude that just lets to have a good

4794.12 --> 4798.199
time he's not looking for no commitments

4796.48 --> 4799.759999999999
he's just BL and then the big girl come

4798.199 --> 4801.759999999999
back or the pretty the ugly girl come

4799.76 --> 4802.8
back like oh he smells good he's so nice

4801.76 --> 4806.1990000000005
we had

4802.8 --> 4808.04
a right and also there's this Universal

4806.199 --> 4810.239
thing that I've learned is that even the

4808.04 --> 4812.6
pretty women they don't actually a lot

4810.239 --> 4815.28
of the time actually on the inside feel

4812.6 --> 4817.08
as pretty as they are looking so if you

4815.28 --> 4819.5199999999995
pick somebody else they're like why

4817.08 --> 4822.04
didn't you pick me am I not pretty

4819.52 --> 4824.8
enough and then they basically tone it

4822.04 --> 4826.679
down a bit and look at it differently

4824.8 --> 4828.52
yep and if you and then what you mess up

4826.679 --> 4830.4800000000005
is when you go straight to them it was

4828.52 --> 4832.84
the obvious call it was the obvious

4830.48 --> 4834.159
prediction right of I'm not saying

4832.84 --> 4837.4400000000005
purposely go for the ugliest yeah and

4834.159 --> 4839.599999999999
then you get the full court ask them all

4837.44 --> 4842.0
ask them all hey anybody here want to

4839.6 --> 4844.52
dance that's what you do and whoever

4842.0 --> 4846.04
stands up does it you dance with them

4844.52 --> 4847.88
that's how you do it because if you go

4846.04 --> 4849.08
to the direct cuz all of them and

4847.88 --> 4850.4800000000005
remember the group of girls know which

4849.08 --> 4852.679
ones they consider the prettiest one in

4850.48 --> 4854.159
their group so they know this too even

4852.679 --> 4857.0
even the most conceited ugliest one

4854.159 --> 4859.32
knows that Katie is prettier than Tama

4857.0 --> 4860.88
you know what I'm say so so so don't so

4859.32 --> 4862.84
don't go straight to the prettiest one

4860.88 --> 4866.04
because they all predicted that oh here

4862.84 --> 4868.1990000000005
he comes here he comes girl yeah they do

4866.04 --> 4870.12
that don't they they're like who's he oh

4868.199 --> 4871.799999999999
my God women that's what I'm saying

4870.12 --> 4874.239
that's how you do it and so when you do

4871.8 --> 4875.8
that and whoever gets up they look at it

4874.239 --> 4878.36
like boom they don't look at it like uh

4875.8 --> 4880.12
oh he's hers they don't look at it like

4878.36 --> 4882.4
that because unless you over there

4880.12 --> 4884.84
grabbing the butt and they slow dancing

4882.4 --> 4886.719
then look at it like okay it's lock down

4884.84 --> 4888.32
that's my girl's man why you talking to

4886.719 --> 4890.84
me now but if you just do it in the ra

4888.32 --> 4892.759999999999
have a good fun don't get up too close

4890.84 --> 4894.639
have a lot of smiling laughing spinning

4892.76 --> 4897.719
around like that and then hey thank you

4894.639 --> 4899.639
for the dance and then go your way or

4897.719 --> 4902.159
say hey can I buy you got any you ladies

4899.639 --> 4904.56
a drink that's how you get them you you

4902.159 --> 4907.36
include all of them because they will

4904.56 --> 4909.0
block T them them bitter ones will block

4907.36 --> 4910.639
and they would discourage the one you

4909.0 --> 4911.6
really want who they don't know in your

4910.639 --> 4913.52
head who you want because they don't

4911.6 --> 4914.84
know what your style is no matter how

4913.52 --> 4917.6
good you look to them they don't know

4914.84 --> 4919.92
what's your style so you you don't want

4917.6 --> 4922.4800000000005
to just make it obvious make it be like

4919.92 --> 4924.1990000000005
you you're a ladies man you love women

4922.48 --> 4927.5199999999995
you love having a good time in general

4924.199 --> 4929.44
they like they like that hence you know

4927.52 --> 4932.320000000001
who gets over like that too other than

4929.44 --> 4935.159
the heterosexual man the gay

4932.32 --> 4937.5199999999995
dude what the gay dude the gay dude

4935.159 --> 4939.44
because he plays that neutral ball too

4937.52 --> 4940.92
he goes over there and he just goes over

4939.44 --> 4942.678999999999
there he conversat and he dances with

4940.92 --> 4943.56
them or if he sees a crowd of them you

4942.679 --> 4945.04
know we always see the crowd of the

4943.56 --> 4946.76
girls dancing in the club two three of

4945.04 --> 4948.88
them together he just jumps in the

4946.76 --> 4950.56
middle and start dancing with all of

4948.88 --> 4953.4400000000005
them and they be like

4950.56 --> 4954.88
ah they play that game remember we

4953.44 --> 4957.0
talking about before the heteros social

4954.88 --> 4958.52
guys trying to play gays but you know

4957.0 --> 4961.52
acting like they into fashion design and

4958.52 --> 4964.040000000001
stuff like that so they can get into the

4961.52 --> 4965.4800000000005
um institution of women and then like we

4964.04 --> 4967.44
was talking about the transgenders that

4965.48 --> 4968.36
that that ended up getting pregnant um

4967.44 --> 4970.599999999999
four

4968.36 --> 4972.239
inmates that's that's a technique that's

4970.6 --> 4974.320000000001
a perverted technique of them doing it

4972.239 --> 4975.839999999999
that's kind of kind like what I'm saying

4974.32 --> 4977.44
please don't draw that into this

4975.84 --> 4978.84
conversation thank you no I'm not but

4977.44 --> 4981.5599999999995
I'm saying but that's kind of like the

4978.84 --> 4984.400000000001
that's like that's that's the type of

4981.56 --> 4987.0
catch the bait the bait is to be the

4984.4 --> 4988.638999999999
neutral brother the neutral dude that

4987.0 --> 4990.76
just likes women to have a good time

4988.639 --> 4992.36
he's not out to to knock you up knock

4990.76 --> 4994.639
you know the bang bang bang we just

4992.36 --> 4997.599999999999
having a good time and Trust they they

4994.639 --> 4999.4400000000005
they love that and then sooner or later

4997.6 --> 5002.84
you next one you know you be like you

4999.44 --> 5004.839999999999
know what Tama she likes you her girl

5002.84 --> 5006.400000000001
will tell you because they've been

5004.84 --> 5008.679
talking about you I'm telling you from

5006.4 --> 5011.28
experience she'll be like why y'all at

5008.679 --> 5012.84
the table laughing it up she'll be like

5011.28 --> 5014.48
shaa likes you or what this one likes

5012.84 --> 5015.96
you and then that's when you know and

5014.48 --> 5017.839999999999
then then then you see who that person

5015.96 --> 5019.76
is and either it is the one that you was

5017.84 --> 5023.1990000000005
always interested in that evening or

5019.76 --> 5025.280000000001
it's not but still you know that you are

5023.199 --> 5027.638999999999
getting a rapport with

5025.28 --> 5031.159
them

5027.639 --> 5034.4800000000005
so it's been a long time since I've had

5031.159 --> 5034.48
to deal with like groups

5034.96 --> 5039.12
yeah I ain't dealt with it in a long

5036.159 --> 5040.719
time neither but I mean hey what they

5039.12 --> 5042.159
say once a play always a play you just

5040.719 --> 5043.44
know how the game is that's why I can

5042.159 --> 5045.719
that's how I can know when other guys

5043.44 --> 5047.48
are playing game that's that's how I can

5045.719 --> 5050.76
tell I can tell when guys are playing

5047.48 --> 5052.919999999999
game like I like I know this is my

5050.76 --> 5056.04
second marriage I've been married 26

5052.92 --> 5059.92
years before and then now got remarried

5056.04 --> 5062.679
so now it's going on what 2016 is going

5059.92 --> 5066.52
seven years seven years s years just

5062.679 --> 5069.1990000000005
passed but I can tell just by observing

5066.52 --> 5071.96
the room what God's interested in my

5069.199 --> 5074.599999999999
wife I can tell I'm observing it and

5071.96 --> 5077.0
she's doing the same thing she's telling

5074.6 --> 5079.679
me that girl over there she like that

5077.0 --> 5081.32
dude over there we be laughing about it

5079.679 --> 5082.639
and I can tell when I go to the bathroom

5081.32 --> 5085.679
and leave her there sitting there or

5082.639 --> 5088.4400000000005
standing wherever we're at I know I can

5085.679 --> 5090.4400000000005
tell I can tell who's going to be the

5088.44 --> 5091.879999999999
one that's going to be dumb enough to go

5090.44 --> 5094.28
over there cuz I know she's going to

5091.88 --> 5095.76
basically either in a kind way or in an

5094.28 --> 5098.32
insulting way depending on how they

5095.76 --> 5099.96
approach like if she knows like upon me

5098.32 --> 5101.4
and her conversation that we've been

5099.96 --> 5103.639
aware that this guy over here has been

5101.4 --> 5105.759999999999
looking over here if she knows that

5103.639 --> 5107.400000000001
person has been doing that and and when

5105.76 --> 5109.6
I get up and he comes over there he's

5107.4 --> 5113.36
going to get his face crushed and his

5109.6 --> 5114.96
feelings hurt because it's being rude

5113.36 --> 5117.32
it'll be one of those you know I'm here

5114.96 --> 5118.8
with my man what are you even standing

5117.32 --> 5121.759999999999
here

5118.8 --> 5123.6
for okay other than that if it's

5121.76 --> 5125.04
somebody that we're not aware like may

5123.6 --> 5127.04
you know that we haven't seen in in the

5125.04 --> 5128.56
room and they do it she'll do it in a

5127.04 --> 5130.119
kind way oh no thank you I'm with

5128.56 --> 5131.76
someone and if he's a gentl he be like

5130.119 --> 5134.639
oh my bad he's a lucky guy and he'll

5131.76 --> 5136.08
walk away you feel what I'm saying so a

5134.639 --> 5138.8
player knows

5136.08 --> 5140.4
game so that's you know so it's like

5138.8 --> 5142.52
riding a bike you just know it's a it's

5140.4 --> 5144.159
a psych it's a sociological thing that

5142.52 --> 5147.040000000001
goes on and when you when you've gone

5144.159 --> 5149.04
out a lot you start to see the thing and

5147.04 --> 5151.5199999999995
and I've never been the type that can

5149.04 --> 5153.32
just easily go up to a girl I remember

5151.52 --> 5154.76
when I was in eth grade and I remember

5153.32 --> 5157.799999999999
Michael Dennis and another friend of

5154.76 --> 5159.04
mine um William mitchu both of them now

5157.8 --> 5160.96
these the basketball players you know

5159.04 --> 5162.6
what I'm saying I was in the football so

5160.96 --> 5163.6
they they said you know such such a like

5162.6 --> 5166.2390000000005
you go over there and say something to

5163.6 --> 5167.679
her you know I'm like what eighth grades

5166.239 --> 5170.638999999999
was like 12 years old something like

5167.679 --> 5174.119
that 12 13 years old my game was weak I

5170.639 --> 5174.119
walked over there and said

5175.52 --> 5179.320000000001
hi her and our friend thought it was

5177.6 --> 5181.280000000001
cute her and our

5179.32 --> 5182.719
friend yeah and we ended up being

5181.28 --> 5184.44
friends you know we ended up being you

5182.719 --> 5187.44
know little play girl you know but it

5184.44 --> 5188.879999999999
never went any further you know but so

5187.44 --> 5192.799999999999
I've never been that real courageous

5188.88 --> 5195.84
person but what helped me was Sports and

5192.8 --> 5197.320000000001
singing like Eddie Murphy said when

5195.84 --> 5198.719
you're a singer even a comedian when

5197.32 --> 5201.36
you're an Entertainer you really don't

5198.719 --> 5201.36
have to do

5201.84 --> 5207.8
much your talent is already an

5205.0 --> 5210.8
attractive thing to them because it kind

5207.8 --> 5213.96
of represents your personality or the

5210.8 --> 5216.8
personality that they think you you have

5213.96 --> 5219.04
in their imagination so either they

5216.8 --> 5222.4400000000005
approach you with a

5219.04 --> 5224.56
Prejudice um you know characteristic of

5222.44 --> 5226.4
you or when you approach them they're

5224.56 --> 5228.88
like they they're seeing that stage come

5226.4 --> 5230.599999999999
to that stage persona come to them so

5228.88 --> 5232.400000000001
it's a lot easier so I I've kind of

5230.6 --> 5233.679
cheated with that even with the sports

5232.4 --> 5235.28
you know they know you playing the

5233.679 --> 5237.1990000000005
football team or whatever you know

5235.28 --> 5238.48
they're gonna be like oh yeah you such a

5237.199 --> 5241.719
like I was lucky when I went to South

5238.48 --> 5244.239
Carolina to play ball my cousin was the

5241.719 --> 5246.719
bars quarterback and he was a good-

5244.239 --> 5249.36
looking dude so he was like oh you Ron's

5246.719 --> 5252.8
cousin you from New

5249.36 --> 5252.799999999999
York so you

5255.52 --> 5262.280000000001
know yeah I I've never you from another

5259.8 --> 5262.28
world

5262.4 --> 5268.48
man no but but but no but your I've just

5265.56 --> 5271.56
never been around those types of

5268.48 --> 5273.599999999999
situations even but look if if if more

5271.56 --> 5275.320000000001
people were in in your world we'd have a

5273.6 --> 5277.6
lot of unwanted pregnancies we'd have a

5275.32 --> 5279.48
lot of less you know heartache we'd have

5277.6 --> 5282.84
a lot of less suicides we'd have a lot

5279.48 --> 5285.239
of less just situations that go on which

5282.84 --> 5287.119000000001
it would be a lot more boring actually

5285.239 --> 5290.159
well that's okay but you know

5287.119 --> 5292.36
promiscuity has its M has most of its

5290.159 --> 5295.879999999999
disadvantages than it

5292.36 --> 5298.48
advantages okay I agree okay so don't

5295.88 --> 5301.88
fail bad at all bro but and I do have it

5298.48 --> 5305.718999999999
in me it's just that I can't really do

5301.88 --> 5309.4800000000005
it because it literally curses me it's

5305.719 --> 5312.84
like God's extra like extra on my

5309.48 --> 5315.759999999999
fingers like with that like nope yeah

5312.84 --> 5318.76
sure you want to do that but it really

5315.76 --> 5321.6
really curses you so you're not going to

5318.76 --> 5324.360000000001
do that cuz you you want to not be

5321.6 --> 5324.360000000001
cursed all the

5324.96 --> 5331.119
time yeah what I I would much rather

5327.44 --> 5333.159
have my children and other children be

5331.119 --> 5335.5199999999995
in other you know children grow up to be

5333.159 --> 5336.638999999999
with your mind frame and people like you

5335.52 --> 5337.88
because you're not the only one as many

5336.639 --> 5340.96
of you like that you know what I'm

5337.88 --> 5344.2390000000005
saying conservative not

5340.96 --> 5347.56
promiscuous understand that that

5344.239 --> 5349.44
marriage is more important matrimony

5347.56 --> 5353.84
rather matrimony is more important than

5349.44 --> 5356.44
to just have free promiscuous sexual

5353.84 --> 5358.92
relationships because there's only

5356.44 --> 5362.5199999999995
disadvantages to it yeah you're not

5358.92 --> 5366.2390000000005
building anything no yeah except for

5362.52 --> 5368.56
like proficiency with sexual things but

5366.239 --> 5370.28
I mean you're not doing anything you're

5368.56 --> 5371.719
just doing it for the amusement and

5370.28 --> 5374.599999999999
that's a bad

5371.719 --> 5378.6
reason right like I see like I don't

5374.6 --> 5381.1990000000005
even see sex like that sex is like it's

5378.6 --> 5384.280000000001
basically to release some of the

5381.199 --> 5386.799999999999
positive tension that's built up that's

5384.28 --> 5389.92
the the chemal or the internal Pro this

5386.8 --> 5393.04
tension process the the chemistry of it

5389.92 --> 5396.52
what they say that's just how it work so

5393.04 --> 5399.28
you shouldn't like seek it

5396.52 --> 5401.84
out you should wait until the tension

5399.28 --> 5405.199
builds up and you have to do

5401.84 --> 5407.639
it right it's the most excited that way

5405.199 --> 5410.36
anyway

5407.639 --> 5413.159000000001
so I'm reading it doesn't disappoint

5410.36 --> 5415.5599999999995
then I'm reading the threads but see I

5413.159 --> 5419.08
can't play the YouTube while we're on

5415.56 --> 5422.88
the thing because then it'll be picked

5419.08 --> 5425.719
up probably coming out of my device

5422.88 --> 5428.8
onto the phone conversation which is

5425.719 --> 5430.88
going to cause um you know echo or

5428.8 --> 5434.679

5542.4 --> 5547.599999999999
experience but it's still good to have

5545.159 --> 5551.199
to see to share with families cuz we all

5547.6 --> 5553.6
share um you know bereavement for

5551.199 --> 5555.919999999999
Pastime people that deceased in our in

5553.6 --> 5557.4800000000005
our in our lifetime so even though it's

5555.92 --> 5560.119
a tear jerking experience it was still

5557.48 --> 5561.799999999999
good to be able to have closure with

5560.119 --> 5563.599999999999
others with other strangers and share

5561.8 --> 5565.400000000001
that same emotional energy you know what

5563.6 --> 5568.6
I mean so that that was a good

5565.4 --> 5572.199
experience and so so what exactly do you

5568.6 --> 5574.4800000000005
mean it's like yeah it's like like a

5572.199 --> 5575.96
general remembrance moment yeah

5574.48 --> 5578.638999999999
remembrance moment but it's actually a

5575.96 --> 5580.96
ceremony where um of course I sang I did

5578.639 --> 5583.92

nice very so it's a yearly thing yeah

5610.6 --> 5616.280000000001
they do it annually yes oh okay yeah

5613.239 --> 5620.119
they do it annually because you know

5616.28 --> 5623.159
this is something because after the

5620.119 --> 5627.5599999999995
hospice um ends there is a

5623.159 --> 5629.08
13-month bereavement counseling and um

5627.56 --> 5631.6

therapeutic session that they do with

5631.6 --> 5636.119000000001
hospice they don't just you know after

5633.76 --> 5638.8
your family's gone you know you don't

5636.119 --> 5641.119
see them anymore but um yeah I love the

5638.8 --> 5643.04
company my wife works for them and um

5641.119 --> 5645.119
they when they first asked me to do

5643.04 --> 5646.28
it I mean I didn't know whether I was

5645.119 --> 5648.159
going to get paid or not but when I

5646.28 --> 5651.44
found out what it was about I was like

5648.159 --> 5653.36
nah this is this is my way of giving

5651.44 --> 5656.599999999999
back

5653.36 --> 5659.04
okay oh yeah I'm glad that it's working

5656.6 --> 5661.92
out for

5659.04 --> 5662.8
you right but I meant actually the

5661.92 --> 5665.2390000000005
debate

5662.8 --> 5667.0
Community hey BR Brandon Cook I was only

5665.239 --> 5670.119
[ __ ] with you I was only [ __ ] with

5667.0 --> 5670.119
you it a it's not that

5670.36 --> 5674.48
serious he said when I say I like you it

5672.679 --> 5676.119
means I like your style nothing more I

5674.48 --> 5678.239
know that I would definitely hope so

5676.119 --> 5679.839999999999
that and I and I get it I didn't I

5678.239 --> 5680.959999999999
didn't misunderstand anything just said

5679.84 --> 5683.400000000001
it you got to look at it from the

5680.96 --> 5686.159
outside somebody reading the text and

5683.4 --> 5688.0
don't know what your you know what your

5686.159 --> 5690.96
intention is in the context of it they

5688.0 --> 5696.0
could they can take it out of context

5690.96 --> 5700.4800000000005
yeah well no if there was some actual

5696.0 --> 5703.56
uh like uh gay tension or whatever I'd

5700.48 --> 5705.638999999999
pick up on it and I would get

5703.56 --> 5707.52
angry I don't sense any of that what he

5705.639 --> 5709.88
said I don't I I looked at it as a joke

5707.52 --> 5711.88
that that Richard G or Adam Price would

5709.88 --> 5713.4400000000005
would even say you know when you said is

5711.88 --> 5715.1990000000005
D Rose horny I I didn't look at it like

5713.44 --> 5717.199
that I was I was just joking I was being

5715.199 --> 5721.879999999999
forious we

5717.199 --> 5724.678999999999
good yeah this ridiculous uh anyway but

5721.88 --> 5727.639
yeah I was the Flat Earth Community Flat

5724.679 --> 5730.92
Earth debates anything like that or do

5727.639 --> 5735.28
you actually follow my show

5730.92 --> 5738.28
regularly or not yeah uh when I no in

5735.28 --> 5739.8
early stage I'm be honest I didn't ever

5738.28 --> 5742.8
get to see you hold I gotta get this

5739.8 --> 5745.639
door hold on y'all get this door I'm I'm

5742.8 --> 5745.639
putting on mute for a

5749.52 --> 5754.320000000001
second oh man

5753.08 --> 5758.44
I'm really

5754.32 --> 5760.799999999999
hungry I wanted to eat my Illuminati cro

5758.44 --> 5764.239
but then right the moment when I wanted

5760.8 --> 5766.52
to bite down the rose came on and now

5764.239 --> 5766.5199999999995
it's

5780.32 --> 5785.32
cold it would be kind of rude if I just

5782.96 --> 5787.52
ate my Illuminati croissant while D Rose

5785.32 --> 5787.5199999999995
was

5791.28 --> 5796.0

[Music]

5810.28 --> 5813.28
conversation

5816.679 --> 5823.32

5818.76 --> 5826.320000000001
rudimentary workings in social life cuz

5823.32 --> 5828.4
I don't really have much of that so it's

5826.32 --> 5830.799999999999
like good to be reminded of how that

5828.4 --> 5830.799999999999
actually

5830.88 --> 5835.6
[Music]

5840.199 --> 5843.199

5845.639 --> 5851.159000000001

6068.679 --> 6076.04
back in the day and and he Eric debay

6071.36 --> 6078.88
basically started the whole shill thing

6076.04 --> 6081.679
but I mean he's got a lot better yeah

6078.88 --> 6085.400000000001
hey welcome back what about Eric debay

6081.679 --> 6087.88
and the sh thing yeah now FBR says was

6085.4 --> 6090.0
asking why does everybody why do people

6087.88 --> 6092.08
hate Eric debay so much and I was like

6090.0 --> 6096.36
what what are you talking

6092.08 --> 6102.0
about Christians might not oh oh yeah

6096.36 --> 6105.04
because of Christians okay yeah sure the

6102.0 --> 6108.0
the Christians out there might not like

6105.04 --> 6110.8
him well too bad for them they probably

6108.0 --> 6113.199
don't like me that much although even

6110.8 --> 6116.320000000001
even though I do consider myself a

6113.199 --> 6118.879999999999
follower of the path of Christ and

6116.32 --> 6121.32
specifically not the

6118.88 --> 6125.2390000000005
Priestly

6121.32 --> 6127.32
routines but yeah Eric debay is not

6125.239 --> 6129.678999999999
respectful of Christ at all I do

6127.32 --> 6132.119
actually respect

6129.679 --> 6134.56
Christ maybe that's the difference maybe

6132.119 --> 6136.5599999999995
that's why that people Christians don't

6134.56 --> 6138.96
hate on me that much because I'm not

6136.56 --> 6141.320000000001
like I'm not like I don't throw Christ

6138.96 --> 6143.639
in the garbage can entirely

6141.32 --> 6146.119
yeah yeah you can't you can't you cannot

6143.639 --> 6148.119
it's ridiculous to do that there's too

6146.119 --> 6151.32
much value to throw

6148.119 --> 6153.719
away I'm admit I've told I don't know

6151.32 --> 6155.599
who it was I don't know if it was um

6153.719 --> 6156.679
Anthony or whoever it was but I told you

6155.599 --> 6158.52
know this when I used to hang out of

6156.679 --> 6162.04
Discord and you was there I will not

6158.52 --> 6163.8
fall in the sword on any any

6162.04 --> 6169.36
dogmatic

6163.8 --> 6172.400000000001
faction set Schism religion iform a

6169.36 --> 6173.639
sword on any of them Christian Cults at

6172.4 --> 6174.799999999999
the end of the day I'll meet youall in

6173.639 --> 6176.679
the middle and I know that there's a

6174.8 --> 6179.119000000001
supreme Almighty most high Creator

6176.679 --> 6182.2390000000005
period Point Blank That's all I need to

6179.119 --> 6184.199
know that's all I need to have belief in

6182.239 --> 6187.4
by the manifestations of the things in

6184.199 --> 6189.08
which I see around me myself nature and

6187.4 --> 6191.44
everything else that there has to have

6189.08 --> 6192.679
been a Creator to do this there is no

6191.44 --> 6193.96
big bang that's that's why I'll leave it

6192.679 --> 6195.1990000000005
at that and that's why I even get to

6193.96 --> 6196.32
that conversation and that's why I

6195.199 --> 6197.96
didn't even put that on the list of

6196.32 --> 6201.199
discussion that I'll talk about because

6197.96 --> 6202.96
it is a very sensitive issue right well

6201.199 --> 6205.28
yeah but now you're already saying like

6202.96 --> 6208.56
that's exactly right because that's what

6205.28 --> 6211.5599999999995
Jesus himself said and for me the whole

6208.56 --> 6215.080000000001
thing what I'm nagging about out there

6211.56 --> 6217.84
and online is the compartmentalization

6215.08 --> 6221.199
of Christ and God it's like no they are

6217.84 --> 6224.96
definitely separate oh yeah and some

6221.199 --> 6227.239
weird blatantly esoteric chance don't

6224.96 --> 6228.84
prove that they're the same I don't like

6227.239 --> 6230.36
to even get into that because that's

6228.84 --> 6232.8
when you get into the argument with them

6230.36 --> 6234.28
that believe the opposite and I like to

6232.8 --> 6236.159000000001
get that into it yeah but then they

6234.28 --> 6239.119
believe in something that they can't

6236.159 --> 6241.92
logically explain and back they it's

6239.119 --> 6246.799999999999
just nonsense then they claim they can

6241.92 --> 6248.04
by a a paper and pen or a transliterated

6246.8 --> 6251.159000000001
falsely

6248.04 --> 6253.32
translated um text you can't because it

6251.159 --> 6256.5199999999995
doesn't make any logical sense they I

6253.32 --> 6258.28
know right they claim they can so I yeah

6256.52 --> 6260.400000000001
but you can't make things that don't

6258.28 --> 6262.599
make logical sense you can't make them

6260.4 --> 6265.759999999999
make sense by just filling in more

6262.599 --> 6268.32
stories you can't make a paradox work

6265.76 --> 6271.2390000000005
than never doesn't matter how much

6268.32 --> 6273.679
materially you present in my reply to

6271.239 --> 6276.48
them I say well then you got to give it

6273.679 --> 6279.4
to the hoc Centric side they have much

6276.48 --> 6281.759999999999
documentation yeah exactly so they

6279.4 --> 6284.879999999999
believe that the Earth spins and that

6281.76 --> 6286.56
it's floating okay so what do you say

6284.88 --> 6288.4800000000005
and all they got to do is back them up

6286.56 --> 6291.320000000001
as a bunch of

6288.48 --> 6293.5199999999995
hierarchy Accolade earnings

6291.32 --> 6296.32
Representatives that wrote something

6293.52 --> 6298.4800000000005
okay so so so that's why I say leave it

6296.32 --> 6302.04
I I don't even I don't even go into that

6298.48 --> 6304.239
because it's funny how you can say that

6302.04 --> 6305.5199999999995
heliocentrics and anti-flat earthists

6304.239 --> 6307.32
believe this that and the other and they

6305.52 --> 6309.320000000001
base it on what nasau says may base it

6307.32 --> 6311.04
on what what these people who they claim

6309.32 --> 6312.44
said in these books that say it but then

6311.04 --> 6314.4
you're G to turn around and you GNA have

6312.44 --> 6317.28
the same argument about something that

6314.4 --> 6320.28
you are purporting that you can't prove

6317.28 --> 6323.159
but you can say well John says it Paul

6320.28 --> 6325.88
says say it Matthew come on bro don't do

6323.159 --> 6332.719
that to me yeah well the theocracy said

6325.88 --> 6335.88
it is FL FL yeah exactly and like for me

6332.719 --> 6339.36
it's like I tie them in very succinctly

6335.88 --> 6341.4400000000005
like they're Lo step you had the the

6339.36 --> 6344.0
Christ subversion where everything is

6341.44 --> 6346.5199999999995
turned inside out the actual teachings

6344.0 --> 6348.56
are subverted in favor of a Priestly

6346.52 --> 6351.4800000000005
interpretation that's like based on

6348.56 --> 6354.119000000001
magical thinking and paradox

6351.48 --> 6356.959999999999
right man being God like he didn't say

6354.119 --> 6360.0
that and like I I rest like he didn't

6356.96 --> 6363.719
say that when he talks esoterically he's

6360.0 --> 6365.28
not saying I am literally God that's not

6363.719 --> 6368.28
what he's saying at all and if you

6365.28 --> 6370.32
interpret that you're insane there you

6368.28 --> 6373.08
go right and hold on but that's just the

6370.32 --> 6375.119
first step because the same process is

6373.08 --> 6377.719
what they've done with Christianity they

6375.119 --> 6381.119
have done with the cosmology I think

6377.719 --> 6383.56
that heliocentrism is directly born from

6381.119 --> 6386.28
Catholicism which is that specific

6383.56 --> 6389.159000000001
turning inside out of Christ teachings

6386.28 --> 6391.5599999999995
the priest teachings they created

6389.159 --> 6393.32
heliocentrism as they turned Christ

6391.56 --> 6395.8
Inside Out is they corrupted

6393.32 --> 6398.0
Christianity the corrupted Christianity

6395.8 --> 6400.76
brought forth the corrupted Inside Out

6398.0 --> 6403.4
cosmology that's how it happened that's

6400.76 --> 6406.2390000000005
where it comes from but you can't say

6403.4 --> 6409.239
that without getting really bad feedback

6406.239 --> 6410.638999999999
from the um you know the soldiers of the

6409.239 --> 6413.919999999999
belief you know what I'm saying then

6410.639 --> 6416.84
you're called the then you're called an

6413.92 --> 6419.88
antichrist well my book says you all my

6416.84 --> 6422.56
book my I read my says you all no it

6419.88 --> 6424.400000000001
doesn't doesn't say that at all well

6422.56 --> 6426.719
this is what this is this is what the

6424.4 --> 6428.679
extremist one particular extremist said

6426.719 --> 6430.52
to me which you know I I mean I pretty

6428.679 --> 6432.84
much brush it off with a grain of salt

6430.52 --> 6436.119000000001
because it you know I just consider it

6432.84 --> 6438.32
like a way of him venting his psychosis

6436.119 --> 6441.48
or whatever it was but back to what you

6438.32 --> 6445.48
said cuz like you said um

6441.48 --> 6447.718999999999
not only did yahawashi yua yahawashi AKA

6445.48 --> 6449.799999999999
Jesus he never said he was and he never

6447.719 --> 6452.28
even talked of himself as a third person

6449.8 --> 6454.159000000001
as he was he literally said just like me

6452.28 --> 6457.239
and you would say or a pastor you go to

6454.159 --> 6459.719
the church they would say our father my

6457.239 --> 6461.5199999999995
father okay you think what I'm saying

6459.719 --> 6464.639
that's why he said to pray Our Father

6461.52 --> 6468.56
not Jesus who are in heaven and he said

6464.639 --> 6471.32
that one time he said me and the father

6468.56 --> 6474.92
are one right

6471.32 --> 6477.84
that's like a communial joint like when

6474.92 --> 6480.1990000000005
me and my wife and child are one we're

6477.84 --> 6483.1990000000005
one unit oh no I'm you know you're

6480.199 --> 6485.5199999999995
literally your wife and your kids yeah

6483.199 --> 6489.759999999999
you're literally your wife and your kids

6485.52 --> 6492.76
you're the physical same person okay

6489.76 --> 6495.599
thank basically what he was saying is

6492.76 --> 6498.1990000000005
what you see is the is the closest

6495.599 --> 6500.92
representation that I can tell you that

6498.199 --> 6504.28
how my father Our Father wants us to

6500.92 --> 6507.76
behave and to be I am the representation

6504.28 --> 6509.159
I am presenting you the Christ the

6507.76 --> 6512.400000000001
highest

6509.159 --> 6515.44
chakra the the the Kundalini highest

6512.4 --> 6517.44
level of being spiritually where you

6515.44 --> 6519.36
where you unconditionally love the

6517.44 --> 6521.919999999999
highest connection yeah you know what

6519.36 --> 6523.5599999999995
I'm saying and and and and if if in the

6521.92 --> 6526.159
beginning it said let's make he and she

6523.56 --> 6528.96
and our and our likeness and our image

6526.159 --> 6531.08
we are all connected to the most high

6528.96 --> 6533.44
Supreme Almighty creator in that manner

6531.08 --> 6537.76
it's just that we allow our flesh unlike

6533.44 --> 6541.4
what um yua yahawashi did not allow to

6537.76 --> 6543.8
impede in our life so we think about the

6541.4 --> 6547.48
to diminish us there you go exactly

6543.8 --> 6550.8
Satan diminishes us lies deceit it all

6547.48 --> 6554.36
takes away of that potential ultimate

6550.8 --> 6556.04
which is ideally Christ that when where

6554.36 --> 6557.839999999999
you get that connection the highest

6556.04 --> 6560.76
chakra connection where you get all

6557.84 --> 6563.52
those things well that only happens if

6560.76 --> 6566.639
you don't let the darkness strip that

6563.52 --> 6568.8
potential away from you in life right

6566.639 --> 6572.119
right right and that's the main

6568.8 --> 6575.56
challenge how do you first realize what

6572.119 --> 6580.159
you have and then how do you prevent the

6575.56 --> 6582.719
devil from making you abandon that

6580.159 --> 6586.719
power yeah that's the greatest challenge

6582.719 --> 6591.119
ever of all man kind there it

6586.719 --> 6592.4
is there it is yeah okay next subject so

6591.119 --> 6594.48
I don't want to you know right hold on

6592.4 --> 6596.839999999999
I'm going to get my Illuminati C out of

6594.48 --> 6599.08
the oven be right back said you going to

6596.84 --> 6600.92

6599.08 --> 6601.92

6604.48 --> 6608.0
gonna go get my Illuminati biscuit out

6606.56 --> 6610.119000000001
the oven sound like he said that I don't

6608.0 --> 6611.199
know maybe it was just my ears maybe

6610.119 --> 6615.5199999999995
because the topic we're talking about

6611.199 --> 6619.04
I'm starting to think about all kinds

6615.52 --> 6621.4400000000005
of conspiracy

6619.04 --> 6623.88
things

6621.44 --> 6628.0

6628.92 --> 6633.92
right you were saying oh no no I was

6632.28 --> 6635.32

6640.159 --> 6643.48
being jokingly because we were talking

6641.599 --> 6647.4400000000005

very

6751.36 --> 6756.839999999999
Cherry you're a bit of a blabber mouth

6754.4 --> 6759.119
but I mean so am I at times right once I

6756.84 --> 6762.92
get going I told you politically correct

6759.119 --> 6764.759999999999
word is laqua laqua laqua yeah you are

blab mouth that's why I we you get along

6764.76 --> 6768.679
CU we and you know how hard is do they

6767.0 --> 6771.0
understand how hard is for me and you to

6768.679 --> 6773.4400000000005
be quiet on on his

6771.0 --> 6775.4
F and then and then when we get a chance

6773.44 --> 6777.799999999999
to get a wordwise we get yelled at for

6775.4 --> 6780.598999999999
interjecting like dude I've been quiet

6777.8 --> 6783.0
for an hour and 47 minutes yeah but the

6780.599 --> 6785.159000000001
problem with you is when you do it you

6783.0 --> 6787.28
actually do start an entirely new

6785.159 --> 6789.879999999999
subject that requires at least five

6787.28 --> 6792.0
minutes you do actually do that in the

6789.88 --> 6794.28
middle of convers I really try to break

6792.0 --> 6796.36
in with like short little insights and

6794.28 --> 6798.239
then Nathan like gets on my ass about it

6796.36 --> 6801.159
and I'm like dude I'm just trying to say

6798.239 --> 6803.159
like one sentence

6801.159 --> 6805.879999999999
come

6803.159 --> 6807.44
on right well a lot of a lot of times

6805.88 --> 6810.400000000001
like lately I haven't been able to hear

6807.44 --> 6813.119
the subject and I'll hear a tail end of

6810.4 --> 6814.92
something so then I'll I'll be on there

6813.119 --> 6817.28
and that's when I say hey guys you know

6814.92 --> 6819.079
it sound like I'm coming from left field

6817.28 --> 6821.119
but um yeah I have that too sometimes

6819.079 --> 6822.88
that I've just I just come back from the

6821.119 --> 6824.44
grocery store and then I'm like hey

6822.88 --> 6825.8
you're in the conversation I want to be

6824.44 --> 6828.36
part of that conversation even though

6825.8 --> 6830.0
I'm not fully aware yet what it is about

6828.36 --> 6833.719
I can already see the form and and then

6830.0 --> 6835.719
I basically fill it in right like I know

6833.719 --> 6839.679
what it's about even though I don't yet

6835.719 --> 6842.0
know what it's about and then I find out

6839.679 --> 6844.04
what it's about or I say something that

6842.0 --> 6845.96
proves that I totally didn't understand

6844.04 --> 6847.8
what we're talking about and that

6845.96 --> 6850.159
happens too

6847.8 --> 6852.639
sometimes I do that a lot I do that a

6850.159 --> 6855.44
lot that's why I do like you said you do

6852.639 --> 6857.96
that Neal hates I put the clap that's

6855.44 --> 6860.0
how I that's how I get to say you know I

6857.96 --> 6861.4
put a smiley face or laughy face or a

6860.0 --> 6862.56
thumbs up like you do I see you doing

6861.4 --> 6865.5199999999995
that me and you the only ones that do

6862.56 --> 6867.76
that yeah but like I said to them in the

6865.52 --> 6870.92
beginning in the Discord that I used to

6867.76 --> 6872.4800000000005
be in the two that I was in which was

6870.92 --> 6873.8
Community things but it wasn't about

6872.48 --> 6875.5599999999995
Flat Earth it was something else it was

6873.8 --> 6877.719
like just a social thing General

6875.56 --> 6879.320000000001
subjects there was a thing when you had

6877.719 --> 6882.199
the mic and that's how I leared this

6879.32 --> 6883.88
whole thing and when you agreed with

6882.199 --> 6885.4
something which drives Nathan crazy you

6883.88 --> 6888.32
said never do it because it messes up

6885.4 --> 6891.32
his his his um his sound is you would

6888.32 --> 6894.199
yeah don't interject agree right you

6891.32 --> 6896.239
don't you don't yeah in the middle of

6894.199 --> 6898.5599999999995
your no you don't do that but this is

6896.239 --> 6901.119
what we did we clicked we clicked the M

6898.56 --> 6903.04
Muk off and on and it wouldn't make a

6901.119 --> 6905.04
sound it would just show that was like a

6903.04 --> 6906.84
finger snap like you agree that was your

6905.04 --> 6908.28
way of agreeing or you would light it up

6906.84 --> 6909.719
back and forth to let you know you

6908.28 --> 6912.239
wanted to say something or you would

6909.719 --> 6914.599
raise your hand which he both things

6912.239 --> 6917.919999999999
that Neil said Nathan can't stand so

6914.599 --> 6920.119000000001
that's why in our Discord discussion

6917.92 --> 6923.4800000000005
whether it be Discord or grou plus

6920.119 --> 6925.639
there's a lot of overt talk and rumpass

6923.48 --> 6926.919999999999
that's one of the problems is because we

6925.639 --> 6930.0
don't know when someone is going to

6926.92 --> 6932.28
finish especially people like Adam um

6930.0 --> 6936.76
sometimes Eli they have these

6932.28 --> 6939.679
P yeah hello Arwin I started doing that

6936.76 --> 6941.599
I become a lot better though but it was

6939.679 --> 6944.0
like sometimes I'm not entirely in tune

6941.599 --> 6945.92
and then I like I say a couple of things

6944.0 --> 6948.4
and then I have like half a second or a

6945.92 --> 6950.8
second break because I'm still trying to

6948.4 --> 6952.879999999999
recalibrate what I'm going to say next

6950.8 --> 6955.1990000000005
because I'm not super optimal sometimes

6952.88 --> 6958.119
I'm not super optimal in like trying to

6955.199 --> 6960.36
explain things and sometimes I am but

6958.119 --> 6962.92
when I'm not people can get confused

6960.36 --> 6965.639
when they try to find a moment to like

6962.92 --> 6968.88
interject and then it like breaks it

6965.639 --> 6970.1990000000005
able dut that word that it's like Eli or

6968.88 --> 6971.639
chocolate said it was Double Dutch like

6970.199 --> 6974.199
playing double dutch you got to know

6971.639 --> 6975.639
when to get in I mean but it's hard to

6974.199 --> 6977.638999999999
know you don't know when the Baton is

6975.639 --> 6979.36
being passed to you so you just say you

6977.639 --> 6981.2390000000005
know what I'm going for it and then you

6979.36 --> 6983.48
get screwed up okay there you go again R

6981.239 --> 6986.32
singing me again this me my statement

6983.48 --> 6989.079
that's NA yeah for the third time fourth

6986.32 --> 6990.92
time fifth time it's hilarious I love it

6989.079 --> 6991.92
though that's that's what attracted me

6990.92 --> 6997.1990000000005
to this

6991.92 --> 6999.36
show was the was the was the

6997.199 --> 7003.04
stern

6999.36 --> 7005.598999999999
intolerant harsh to the point

7003.04 --> 7007.28
temperament of the show and I and I and

7005.599 --> 7008.639
and it was and it was comical you know

7007.28 --> 7010.719
it was comical so that's what really

7008.639 --> 7013.159000000001
brought me to the show I was like I like

7010.719 --> 7014.36
this one and then you know little by

7013.159 --> 7015.799999999999
little I realized oh I'm actually

7014.36 --> 7017.36
learning some stuff and a lot of things

7015.8 --> 7020.360000000001
started recollecting in what I learned

7017.36 --> 7021.239
before so now well it's a show where

7020.36 --> 7023.799999999999
there's

7021.239 --> 7028.079
basically another layer to it where

7023.8 --> 7031.4400000000005
there's like a bit of OCD and strictness

7028.079 --> 7034.239
against it right well normally that

7031.44 --> 7037.159
doesn't happen when somebody goes OCD in

7034.239 --> 7040.5599999999995
a show they usually like don't come back

7037.159 --> 7043.44
because they basically ruin it right out

7040.56 --> 7046.679
there in media land so to have somebody

7043.44 --> 7049.44
actually then no no no we're not GNA

7046.679 --> 7051.88
like cut it out oh quick [ __ ] the feed

7049.44 --> 7054.32
No we're going to just address the

7051.88 --> 7058.4400000000005
misbehavior and like actually deal with

7054.32 --> 7060.119
it and that's new that's like new on the

7058.44 --> 7063.32
internet

7060.119 --> 7065.44
new and Nathan does that I do that too

7063.32 --> 7069.159
although yeah I'm not much of a show I'm

7065.44 --> 7071.919999999999
very small but right with like subjects

7069.159 --> 7075.5599999999995
Al but it is a new thing and I don't see

7071.92 --> 7079.32
other people do that people just don't

7075.56 --> 7080.719
do it or they treat them like trolls

7079.32 --> 7083.0
right but when you treat them like

7080.719 --> 7084.719
trolls you're not actually yeah like it

7083.0 --> 7087.679
doesn't work when your colleagues are

7084.719 --> 7089.44
acting out acting up or

7087.679 --> 7092.4
something

7089.44 --> 7094.598999999999
so right and um and and and you you're

7092.4 --> 7098.159
talking about even the aspect of the de

7094.599 --> 7101.159000000001
the debating forum and protocol like

7098.159 --> 7103.679
most debates that I knew of ever heard

7101.159 --> 7106.239
of is that you let one person speak for

7103.679 --> 7107.84
like 10 15 minutes and you got to take

7106.239 --> 7110.32
notes to make sure the things whether it

7107.84 --> 7112.28
be a electoral presidential or

7110.32 --> 7113.84
Congressional you know campaign debate

7112.28 --> 7115.5599999999995
or whatever or even if it's about

7113.84 --> 7118.360000000001
education you have to literally let that

7115.56 --> 7120.92
person talk on and on and you cannot

7118.36 --> 7123.44
interject to catch them in their

7120.92 --> 7125.679
fallacious claim or their straw man

7123.44 --> 7127.5599999999995
claims or whatever or their implications

7125.679 --> 7129.84
you have to wait and jot it down and

7127.56 --> 7131.2390000000005
then you have to address it and

7129.84 --> 7132.92
hopefully you wrote down everything or

7131.239 --> 7135.598999999999
you can recollect what they said so that

7132.92 --> 7138.28
you can counter accordingly to impress

7135.599 --> 7140.32
the audience as much as that person your

7138.28 --> 7143.4
opponent has impressed the the the

7140.32 --> 7145.92
audience with their gibberish their

7143.4 --> 7148.159
propaganda basically I like about the

7145.92 --> 7150.679
way you guys do y'all nip it in the bud

7148.159 --> 7152.839999999999
y'all nip it right in the bud tap the

7150.679 --> 7154.52
breaks don't even try that what did you

7152.84 --> 7156.1990000000005
just say and you know what I love who

7154.52 --> 7159.88
does that the new guy trying to take

7156.199 --> 7161.719
trau out of Canada oh yeah yeah yeah

7159.88 --> 7164.88
he does not

7161.719 --> 7166.88
play he go hard he like break that down

7164.88 --> 7170.52
what do you mean by that he don't let

7166.88 --> 7173.52
the interview the and some of these uh f

7170.52 --> 7176.1990000000005
f yeah for for democracy politicians

7173.52 --> 7178.84
here in the Netherlands also really do

7176.199 --> 7181.199
that although they're all basically

7178.84 --> 7183.599
taking an underdog position they're

7181.199 --> 7186.638999999999
getting bullied by these freaks

7183.599 --> 7189.76
autocrats but they point out every

7186.639 --> 7192.96
freaking detail every time they got like

7189.76 --> 7195.360000000001
an entire team that's like that will

7192.96 --> 7198.32
like everything that is said with every

7195.36 --> 7201.598999999999
context like is completely addressed and

7198.32 --> 7204.079
it's like this mindboggling puzzle of

7201.599 --> 7206.32
propaganda that they have to deal with

7204.079 --> 7208.04
but they're working through it though

7206.32 --> 7211.119
and they're doing it they're completely

7208.04 --> 7214.28
addressing like all the the misleading

7211.119 --> 7216.5599999999995
techniques and Straw Men everything

7214.28 --> 7219.28
right they're getting really detailed at

7216.56 --> 7222.96
it and the weird thing is though that

7219.28 --> 7226.239
like the the corrupted groups the Deep

7222.96 --> 7228.599
State let's just say it like they're

7226.239 --> 7231.159
noticing they're getting intellectually

7228.599 --> 7232.56
defeated and they just don't care

7231.159 --> 7235.159
they're just

7232.56 --> 7238.159000000001
like just like yeah we don't care we're

7235.159 --> 7242.0
just they're almost now doing the

7238.159 --> 7244.719
Foolery the propaganda more to convince

7242.0 --> 7246.639
themselves than they are to convince the

7244.719 --> 7249.76
outside world because the outside world

7246.639 --> 7252.079
is mostly not buying it anymore

7249.76 --> 7253.8
uhhuh and that sounds very familiar

7252.079 --> 7255.28
doesn't it when I say it all like that

7253.8 --> 7257.159000000001
because it's exactly like what's

7255.28 --> 7259.92
happened with the anti flat earthers and

7257.159 --> 7262.0
I've drawn this analogy very early on

7259.92 --> 7265.079
it's like wow what we do at the Flat

7262.0 --> 7266.119
Earth debates it sounds just like

7265.079 --> 7269.719
freaking

7266.119 --> 7272.5199999999995
politics it just exactly like when they

7269.719 --> 7275.84
debate the same nonsense the same

7272.52 --> 7278.159000000001
distractions the same oh attitudes

7275.84 --> 7281.88
absolute manipulative horseshit it

7278.159 --> 7281.879999999999
happens exact the same

7282.0 --> 7288.239
way yeah and like like how somebody's

7286.159 --> 7289.638999999999
making a point like making a point this

7288.239 --> 7292.04
specific thing is happening it's

7289.639 --> 7295.36
happening in that and happening in that

7292.04 --> 7298.159
and then after that they

7295.36 --> 7302.04
literally the opposition like responds

7298.159 --> 7304.119
in a way like they didn't hear any of

7302.04 --> 7306.4
those points being continually repeated

7304.119 --> 7309.759999999999
like they basically act like they didn't

7306.4 --> 7312.32
hear it like they do that [ __ ]

7309.76 --> 7314.88
politics man just like the anti flat

7312.32 --> 7317.44
earthers in these

7314.88 --> 7320.599
conversations true it's crazy how much

7317.44 --> 7321.719
it is alike and this is the thing this

7320.599 --> 7325.2390000000005
is the

7321.719 --> 7326.84
thing put no no I G to say put them

7325.239 --> 7331.598999999999
aside

7326.84 --> 7333.119000000001
embrace your opinions and your curiosity

7331.599 --> 7335.96
and your

7333.119 --> 7339.04
inquisitiveness embrace it however when

7335.96 --> 7343.56
it comes to standing on falling on the

7339.04 --> 7346.44
sword in something M I don't think what

7343.56 --> 7349.719
sorry on a sword about anything falling

7346.44 --> 7351.5599999999995
on a sword yeah fall no way what the

7349.719 --> 7354.76
hell am I gonna fall on the sword for

7351.56 --> 7358.8
yeah right just say it could be it could

7354.76 --> 7361.320000000001
be not what if it was hey you ever

7358.8 --> 7362.84
thought of it could be this way and then

7361.32 --> 7366.36
on other things that you're more you

7362.84 --> 7370.96
stand foundation and firm on look at it

7366.36 --> 7370.96
like this um

7371.079 --> 7376.44
I don't believe I know because of this

7374.159 --> 7379.719
that and the other and then you base

7376.44 --> 7383.678999999999
your evidence to prove why you stand on

7379.719 --> 7388.4
your claim but don't regurgitate a claim

7383.679 --> 7391.52
from somebody else or don't um try to

7388.4 --> 7395.5199999999995
make something concrete and make it that

7391.52 --> 7399.8
it is what it is based on what's what's

7395.52 --> 7402.719
trendy to be said or what your opin is

7399.8 --> 7405.719
and you can't prove it because and then

7402.719 --> 7407.639
then on top of that judge somebody else

7405.719 --> 7409.639
in a negative way who disagrees with

7407.639 --> 7410.84
your opinion and your speculation

7409.639 --> 7414.119
because that's what makes this whole

7410.84 --> 7417.84
thing chaotic and

7414.119 --> 7421.239
toxic we all have the right to believe

7417.84 --> 7423.360000000001
what we want to believe but long as we

7421.239 --> 7425.919999999999
substantiate that we're we're saying we

7423.36 --> 7427.759999999999
believe it we don't know for sure and

7425.92 --> 7430.4
sometimes it's all right to not

7427.76 --> 7433.280000000001
know right right well just be honest

7430.4 --> 7436.4
just preface things honestly don't just

7433.28 --> 7439.719
mix it all into one right it's preface

7436.4 --> 7442.32
it properly you don't know your your

7439.719 --> 7444.079
your your idol doesn't know your

7442.32 --> 7449.32
favorite

7444.079 --> 7454.759999999999
asisted Misfit doesn't know your famous

7449.32 --> 7458.96
astrom doesn't know so nobody knows the

7454.76 --> 7461.360000000001
construct of the Sun for instance all

7458.96 --> 7464.0
know that is hot as [ __ ] and it is

7461.36 --> 7467.92
bright as hell that's all we know and

7464.0 --> 7470.159
it's up in the sky leave it at that and

7467.92 --> 7473.599
and just be humble and walk away with

7470.159 --> 7475.638999999999
that doesn't make you stupid you are not

7473.599 --> 7478.2390000000005
the most high Supreme Almighty Creator

7475.639 --> 7480.559
you did not create that thing so stop

7478.239 --> 7483.678999999999
trying to act like you got all the

7480.559 --> 7487.400000000001
answers H by the way funny way to name

7483.679 --> 7489.639
it like astrophysic and astrom

7487.4 --> 7493.32
Mystic yeah d you go that's another year

7489.639 --> 7496.599

7493.32 --> 7499.119
Misfit astr fisted that's

7496.599 --> 7501.28
hilarious but they are kind of Mystics

7499.119 --> 7503.759999999999
right yeah they they're just Conjuring

7501.28 --> 7505.679
forth these things from a non-existing

7503.76 --> 7510.719
realm that they pretend to be real

7505.679 --> 7513.4800000000005
that's Mystics yeah yeah I mean I grew

7510.719 --> 7515.32
up loving magic to this day I love magic

7513.48 --> 7518.079
I love that somebody can do something

7515.32 --> 7519.32
that I can't solve but I'm not that

7518.079 --> 7520.92
stupid

7519.32 --> 7523.239
to think that Copperfield can actually

7520.92 --> 7526.36
make an elephant elephant

7523.239 --> 7527.959999999999
Elevate I'm just I'm just baffled and

7526.36 --> 7530.598999999999
and tickled to death like a little girl

7527.96 --> 7532.679
watching Elvis sing back in the 60s that

7530.599 --> 7536.639
he fooled me and I can't I love that

7532.679 --> 7538.4400000000005
that show um it's SP those two guys the

7536.639 --> 7540.36
one doesn't talk I forgot the two

7538.44 --> 7541.719
magicians they're they're world renowned

7540.36 --> 7543.4
forgot their names but it's one is a

7541.719 --> 7545.2390000000005
tall heavy set guy the other one's a

7543.4 --> 7547.239
short dude he doesn't speak but they

7545.239 --> 7549.239
famous duet there's a famous D and they

7547.239 --> 7551.0
had a show called fool me fo not or

7549.239 --> 7552.799999999999
something can you fool me I used love

7551.0 --> 7554.119
watching that show because it gave the

7552.8 --> 7556.8
audience a chance it was like a

7554.119 --> 7558.36
contestant show can you find out what it

7556.8 --> 7561.2390000000005
was they had these other magicians who

7558.36 --> 7564.32
were lower ranking magicians do tricks

7561.239 --> 7566.119
and these two guys pen pening something

7564.32 --> 7567.88
they would have yeah pen there you go

7566.119 --> 7569.28
pen it and tell it thank you Dan and

7567.88 --> 7571.04
they would have to solve what those

7569.28 --> 7574.239
magicians did and I was not only

7571.04 --> 7576.5199999999995
impressed by that they were able to

7574.239 --> 7578.159
solve what these guys did and that's how

7576.52 --> 7580.0
they eliminated the contestants and the

7578.159 --> 7582.799999999999
one that could F

7580.0 --> 7585.639
penella were the winners but I love

7582.8 --> 7589.559
magic but I know dog

7585.639 --> 7592.96
well that David Blaine the most

7589.559 --> 7596.119000000001
incredible on this planet I say plan on

7592.96 --> 7598.639
this plane that has ever done he makes

7596.119 --> 7603.28
everybody else look like garbage because

7598.639 --> 7606.8
he really does things that are um beyond

7603.28 --> 7609.639
beyond human tolerance physiological

7606.8 --> 7612.320000000001
tolerance so he's more mystical to

7609.639 --> 7613.599
me because if you can have a camera

7612.32 --> 7615.719
unless they unless they got a great

7613.599 --> 7618.0
editing team that can have him be in a

7615.719 --> 7619.92
tank for so long he's almost died doing

7618.0 --> 7623.159
the stunts that he's done he's more than

7619.92 --> 7625.599
just a magician but I do know other than

7623.159 --> 7627.96
David Blaine which I still I still

7625.599 --> 7631.52
sometimes me and wife say it's all fake

7627.96 --> 7634.96
dude the entire the entire power of all

7631.52 --> 7636.8
magicians is that it's all fake I all of

7634.96 --> 7639.28
it I got you maybe when you think he's

7636.8 --> 7641.0
underwater and you can see him maybe he

7639.28 --> 7642.88
has some type of apparatus that allows

7641.0 --> 7643.679
him to breathe that we how do you know

7642.88 --> 7646.1990000000005
he's

7643.679 --> 7648.599
underwater well because you can see him

7646.199 --> 7650.919999999999
bushing around in the water he comes out

7648.599 --> 7653.92
soaking wet he gets in the water and you

7650.92 --> 7655.28
see him submerge himself in the water

7653.92 --> 7657.88
yeah have you ever watch enough have you

7655.28 --> 7660.719
ever watched and he's he's then staying

7657.88 --> 7664.04
in it for a very long time a do you know

7660.719 --> 7665.44
who he is first of all H do you know who

7664.04 --> 7668.599
I'm talking

7665.44 --> 7670.44
about yeah David Lane yeah yeah okay

7668.599 --> 7673.28
have you ever seen him and watched his

7670.44 --> 7675.04
work now these things on the street okay

7673.28 --> 7677.719
he's done some pretty incredible things

7675.04 --> 7680.719
I agree okay incredible and

7677.719 --> 7683.88
inexplicable not inexplicable but

7680.719 --> 7687.4
incredible okay well then it's just I I

7683.88 --> 7690.36
can't explain it but I know somebody in

7687.4 --> 7693.079
the direction of like how something like

7690.36 --> 7693.079
that would be

7694.199 --> 7700.5199999999995
tricked because everything that he does

7696.52 --> 7702.400000000001
is tricked everything how it works yeah

7700.52 --> 7705.040000000001
that's what makes you a magician is that

7702.4 --> 7708.759999999999
it's not real that's the

7705.04 --> 7710.44
point but um yeah so so but but I do I I

7708.76 --> 7712.88
do have like you said even to that

7710.44 --> 7715.32
extreme where I'm still bewildered and

7712.88 --> 7717.079
baffled you still have common sense to

7715.32 --> 7719.92
know that it's all a

7717.079 --> 7722.36
trick however with David Blaine let's

7719.92 --> 7724.4400000000005
just say he can do things to his body

7722.36 --> 7725.839999999999
which we could not do he trains himself

7724.44 --> 7728.0
to hold his breath longer than the

7725.84 --> 7729.639
average human being he does he does

7728.0 --> 7733.88
magic in the Guinness book of record

7729.639 --> 7735.84
style okay like he can go without food

7733.88 --> 7737.36
go without water go without go

7735.84 --> 7740.52
underwater he can do things like that

7737.36 --> 7742.88
that defies or he has specific substance

7740.52 --> 7745.0
that he can consume that can oxygenate

7742.88 --> 7747.28
his blood without breathing for several

7745.0 --> 7749.96
hours that's that okay maybe that's

7747.28 --> 7753.48
that's the key to his thing there you go

7749.96 --> 7755.719
yeah it's all Trick all of it and they

7753.48 --> 7757.678999999999
have stuff that's not Declassified

7755.719 --> 7761.199
that's part of the trickery yeah they

7757.679 --> 7764.679
use high magicians get access to really

7761.199 --> 7767.96
High secret tech tech oh they sign that

7764.679 --> 7769.8
they that they can use under secrecy to

7767.96 --> 7772.159
a limited degree as long as it's not

7769.8 --> 7774.2390000000005
getting discovered oh yeah they have a

7772.159 --> 7776.4
community they have a fraternity SAR

7774.239 --> 7778.44
where where if they're

7776.4 --> 7780.48
caught telling the trick like they used

7778.44 --> 7782.96
to have another show on Fox the mask

7780.48 --> 7784.239
magician used to do all the tricks and

7782.96 --> 7785.679
he would never tell what it is but he

7784.239 --> 7787.959999999999
would do all the famous tricks that

7785.679 --> 7789.599
people were always entertained by but he

7787.96 --> 7791.719
would never explain it because and he

7789.599 --> 7794.639
would hide his face

7791.719 --> 7797.52
because because out of respect he didn't

7794.639 --> 7801.04
want the public or his peers to know who

7797.52 --> 7803.719
he was breaking this sort of reach of

7801.04 --> 7805.96
disclaimer you know to the to the public

7803.719 --> 7808.079
but but like I said you still have the

7805.96 --> 7811.199
common sense to know that what they're

7808.079 --> 7812.5199999999995
doing is not real some people don't have

7811.199 --> 7816.919999999999
the

7812.52 --> 7819.8
capacity to to get to that level they

7816.92 --> 7822.079
really believe that this guy chopped his

7819.8 --> 7824.559
leg off and put it back

7822.079 --> 7827.4
on I'm just saying that's that's the

7824.559 --> 7829.52
that's the level of of of of of of you

7827.4 --> 7831.96
know psychosis that some people have and

7829.52 --> 7835.119000000001
that's what that's what these um these

7831.96 --> 7837.559
priests and these Mystics these asist as

7835.119 --> 7839.36
you know astrof fisted Misfits and these

7837.559 --> 7841.400000000001
astrom

7839.36 --> 7843.199
monomers you know that's my side joke

7841.4 --> 7844.92
that Adam teas me about that's great the

7843.199 --> 7846.879999999999
way you say that almost sounds like a

7844.92 --> 7848.8
mat from Quantum of conscious

7846.88 --> 7852.28
description oh yeah

7848.8 --> 7852.28
said it sound like the Sesame

7853.44 --> 7859.44
Street but that's like almost a hobo

7856.639 --> 7863.1990000000005
codification from Matt from Quantum of

7859.44 --> 7866.159
conscious brilliant right oh okay but

7863.199 --> 7868.48
yeah I don't know you know so I know

7866.159 --> 7870.0
it's not real but you want you want it

7868.48 --> 7871.959999999999
to be real because you're so entertained

7870.0 --> 7875.079
that you can't figure it out so people

7871.96 --> 7876.36
can't figure out about you know the

7875.079 --> 7877.679
spinning of the earth and stuff like

7876.36 --> 7879.719
that so they just like to they want to

7877.679 --> 7882.36
stay in that

7879.719 --> 7884.719
box yep don't take don't take my joy

7882.36 --> 7887.36
you're a kill Joy I like the fact that I

7884.719 --> 7890.32
can probably go to to Sat one day know

7887.36 --> 7891.719
that new I don't like I just don't like

7890.32 --> 7893.679
magicians because I know they're

7891.719 --> 7896.92
tricking me and I don't want to get

7893.679 --> 7899.4
caught up in the fascination of

7896.92 --> 7901.04
something because it's always because

7899.4 --> 7904.679
it's a misleading what you're going to

7901.04 --> 7906.84
be fascinated with is the part that also

7904.679 --> 7909.1990000000005
distracts you from how it's actually

7906.84 --> 7911.76
done that's the the nature of all good

7909.199 --> 7913.28
magician tricks and I don't want to play

7911.76 --> 7917.1990000000005
that game I don't want to have my

7913.28 --> 7918.5199999999995
attention be subjected to that be real

7917.199 --> 7922.598999999999
roaded like

7918.52 --> 7927.719
that so I don't like it I like real

7922.599 --> 7931.679
magic like hey I can literally like

7927.719 --> 7933.96
attract and remove pain from somebody

7931.679 --> 7937.4
and literally describe to you what that

7933.96 --> 7941.36
pain feels like at a distance yeah

7937.4 --> 7943.558999999999
that's Magic I can do that my sister can

7941.36 --> 7945.199
too I told you my sister's into that

7943.559 --> 7948.84
she's into that's oh that's right did I

7945.199 --> 7951.759999999999
give you her information I gave her I I

7948.84 --> 7953.599
think I gave did I give her in the Skype

7951.76 --> 7956.04
I told you about my sister melan starg

7953.599 --> 7959.2390000000005
she's one of the crystals and you know

7956.04 --> 7961.44
the RO the rock it yeah Rocky and all

7959.239 --> 7962.759999999999
that she's into all that stuff man y

7961.44 --> 7964.558999999999
y'all would really hit it off and me

7962.76 --> 7966.1990000000005
she's deep into it she even I think

7964.559 --> 7968.8
she's licensed to do one of them things

7966.199 --> 7971.119
and she's a licensed Mass licensed

7968.8 --> 7973.719
yeah now she's a LPN as well so she's

7971.119 --> 7977.04
into the Al apathic and the um holistic

7973.719 --> 7981.4
spiritual you know methodology she's

7977.04 --> 7983.679
she's like yeah she's you know she's how

7981.4 --> 7985.92
can you be in the AL apathic methodology

7983.679 --> 7987.88
I mean to know about it is good pays

7985.92 --> 7992.92
more it pays

7987.88 --> 7993.719
more yeah but why huh because it kills

7992.92 --> 7996.2390000000005
that's

7993.719 --> 7999.639
why well she does she allopathic

7996.239 --> 8001.718999999999
medicine like hospice she's she's pretty

7999.639 --> 8003.28
much hospice she just gives Comfort to

8001.719 --> 8004.639
those who I think she's in the hospice

8003.28 --> 8006.48
field that's the that's the thing she

8004.639 --> 8009.400000000001
joined hospice taking care of the people

8006.48 --> 8012.199
that are that are um that are on their

8009.4 --> 8014.0
last few weeks or days okay just give

8012.199 --> 8016.719
them as much comfort until they

8014.0 --> 8019.239
transition well that makes sense because

8016.719 --> 8021.84
dying is exactly what Al apathic

8019.239 --> 8025.0
medicine is good

8021.84 --> 8026.96
for sorry to say it like that but right

8025.0 --> 8031.079
yeah these are all like post

8026.96 --> 8033.36
chemotherapy and radiation You Know M

8031.079 --> 8035.48
and if you want to know how to treat

8033.36 --> 8038.079
people that have been completely

8035.48 --> 8041.199
chemical and surgically

8038.079 --> 8042.96
wrecked then alathia knows everything

8041.199 --> 8044.879999999999
about that because that's what they do

8042.96 --> 8047.0
with people and that's why they know

8044.88 --> 8048.76
everything about that they know exactly

8047.0 --> 8051.159
what you need after your body's been all

8048.76 --> 8053.1990000000005
[ __ ] up because they are experts at

8051.159 --> 8057.079
[ __ ] people's body up so they know

8053.199 --> 8058.759999999999
everything about how that is y hey

8057.079 --> 8062.36
Brandon Cook brought up something that I

8058.76 --> 8064.0
was going to say hypnotism now my wife

8062.36 --> 8066.119
now at the Funny Bone where they have

8064.0 --> 8069.239
all the celebrity comedians come through

8066.119 --> 8072.28
in in certain States they have a thing

8069.239 --> 8075.4
hypnotist I don't play that I'm not into

8072.28 --> 8077.639
that and I don't get it neither Brandon

8075.4 --> 8079.5199999999995
I don't get it I don't play with it I'm

8077.639 --> 8082.159000000001
not interested in it and I tell my wife

8079.52 --> 8084.159000000001
do not do it it doesn't work on me I can

8082.159 --> 8086.0
feel why I'm being hypnotized it doesn't

8084.159 --> 8088.638999999999
work it only works I think it only works

8086.0 --> 8091.04
on people who puts themselves

8088.639 --> 8093.639
under subjugation to it it's when you no

8091.04 --> 8096.639
but you have to surrender to it you have

8093.639 --> 8099.599
to enslave yourself to an external

8096.639 --> 8102.2390000000005
influence and then it works I don't do

8099.599 --> 8104.8
that I can't do that I'll start clawing

8102.239 --> 8105.799999999999
people's faces off yeah I said I said

8104.8 --> 8107.679
why would you want to do that why would

8105.8 --> 8109.599
you want somebody why would you let why

8107.679 --> 8110.92
would you allow somebody to get into

8109.599 --> 8113.4800000000005
your

8110.92 --> 8116.4400000000005
subconscious and and and and manipulate

8113.48 --> 8118.638999999999
just I said I said that's like I don't

8116.44 --> 8120.839999999999
know that's like that's that's worse SNM

8118.639 --> 8122.76
it's like being hacked it's like being

8120.84 --> 8125.28
hacked and you don't know what the

8122.76 --> 8127.079000000001
hacker is going to leave behind yeah i'

8125.28 --> 8129.119
rather be handcuffed and spank with a

8127.079 --> 8131.119
with a whip with an apple in my mouth on

8129.119 --> 8134.48
an apparatus than to somebody to jump

8131.119 --> 8136.0
into my my spirit my subconscious and um

8134.48 --> 8137.919999999999
and mess around like and mess around

8136.0 --> 8139.4
with my subconscious and and do

8137.92 --> 8141.52
something to me like there's this video

8139.4 --> 8143.759999999999
of this guy that goes around and I don't

8141.52 --> 8145.96
know I want to be there live to watch it

8143.76 --> 8148.400000000001
because on video I don't know if these

8145.96 --> 8150.719
are accessories to the trick

8148.4 --> 8152.48
because it could be me you and Nathan us

8150.719 --> 8155.0
walking around this guy will pull Nathan

8152.48 --> 8157.4
or one of us over and just start doing

8155.0 --> 8160.0
it and we'll be right there witnessing

8157.4 --> 8162.04
this dude this guy knows how to make you

8160.0 --> 8164.88
not be able to get up off the

8162.04 --> 8166.5199999999995
ground he can make you not be able to

8164.88 --> 8169.4400000000005
remember your name through quick talking

8166.52 --> 8172.2390000000005
right very rapidly yeah I know I know

8169.44 --> 8174.199
how that works oh man dude I don't like

8172.239 --> 8177.36
that that's that's but that's like how

8174.199 --> 8179.919999999999
they do snake hypnotism so what it does

8177.36 --> 8182.759999999999
is basically uh it's like a certain

8179.92 --> 8186.32
Rhythm it's about the Rhythm that plays

8182.76 --> 8188.719
into your Reptilian Brain it's really

8186.32 --> 8191.558999999999
weird that's you're being hypnotized

8188.719 --> 8194.639
like a snake and what is that called the

8191.559 --> 8196.679
obligant what is it what is that part of

8194.639 --> 8198.438999999998
The Reptilian part The Reptilian part of

8196.679 --> 8201.559
your brain you have all these different

8198.439 --> 8206.2
brain Parts segments and The Reptilian

8201.559 --> 8208.199999999999
Brain is just this this part that does

8206.2 --> 8211.240000000002
certain things and but it's the same

8208.2 --> 8213.439
part that that allows that

8211.24 --> 8215.399
hypnotism yeah it's a medical term for

8213.439 --> 8217.800000000001
it

8215.399 --> 8219.84
abant I don't know what it's called I

8217.8 --> 8222.88
always I always Jack it up my wife

8219.84 --> 8225.0
laughs at me but it's like the bottom

8222.88 --> 8227.16
part of your brain or whatever and at

8225.0 --> 8230.0
the back I think anybody know what put

8227.16 --> 8230.0
in the text in the

8234.8 --> 8244.24
chat there it is y there it is medulla

8240.0 --> 8246.0
abant yep that's it I be like Messa

8244.24 --> 8249.119999999999
Messa or

8246.0 --> 8252.359
Medusa Medusa obligated Medusa

8249.12 --> 8254.800000000001
obligatory right but the thing is it's

8252.359 --> 8258.399000000001
that sort of hypnotism the rapid talk

8254.8 --> 8261.84
hypnotism that's about the Rhythm yeah

8258.399 --> 8263.76
they could be saying anything but right

8261.84 --> 8266.399
they're what they do is they introduce

8263.76 --> 8268.599
this Rhythm and then draw your attention

8266.399 --> 8271.08
away with the words they're saying so

8268.599 --> 8273.960000000001
your attention is grabbed by the words

8271.08 --> 8275.84
while they play into that part of your

8273.96 --> 8278.598999999998
brain The Reptilian like the snake

8275.84 --> 8280.2
inside of you through the Rhythm so you

8278.599 --> 8282.319
think it's about the words but it's

8280.2 --> 8284.719000000001
actually about the Rhythm all right by

8282.319 --> 8287.439
your attention being drawn away to what

8284.719 --> 8290.399
is said you don't pay attention to how

8287.439 --> 8293.599
that snake part of you is being rhythmed

8290.399 --> 8295.96
out and that's how that hypnotism works

8293.599 --> 8298.12
so if you know if you can hear like oh

8295.96 --> 8300.678999999998
he's doing the rapid talk oh he's going

8298.12 --> 8303.0
to try to distract away my attention

8300.679 --> 8306.399
from that he is doing the the the

8303.0 --> 8308.439
hypnotize Rhythm thing and that's like

8306.399 --> 8309.96
it doesn't work and I get offended I

8308.439 --> 8313.319
literally

8309.96 --> 8316.279999999999
like I strike like the snake if somebody

8313.319 --> 8319.479
tries that on me it's like nope you will

8316.28 --> 8320.719000000001
not do that on me I don't like that I I

8319.479 --> 8323.08
don't play I don't play that I don't

8320.719 --> 8324.839999999998
play that I don't I don't it's it's

8323.08 --> 8326.679
about the Rhythm It's the Rhythm that

8324.84 --> 8329.04
hypnotizes you it's the words that

8326.679 --> 8331.92
distract you away from that the rhythm

8329.04 --> 8335.599
is hypnotizing

8331.92 --> 8337.28
you it's it's sophisticated what kind of

8335.599 --> 8339.08
whatever they doing to you they could

8337.28 --> 8340.960000000001
they could be making it has a name they

8339.08 --> 8343.479
can put you into chronic they can put

8340.96 --> 8343.479
you into a

8344.319 --> 8348.279999999999
chronic next thing you know you can't

8346.28 --> 8352.0
even help peing well the Rhythm makes

8348.28 --> 8353.479000000001
you loose like a piece of clay hello

8352.0 --> 8357.2
sorry come

8353.479 --> 8361.399
on well the Rhythm shakes you up like a

8357.2 --> 8363.84
piece CL and they can then mold you once

8361.399 --> 8366.96
they've achieved that right once you're

8363.84 --> 8368.880000000001
CAU in the rhythm you're in the flow

8366.96 --> 8372.678999999998
then they can literally just like oh oh

8368.88 --> 8372.679
just make you this make you

8374.08 --> 8378.88
that yeah I just don't like that because

8376.599 --> 8380.2
if there's a trigger word it could be

8378.88 --> 8382.279999999999
you know any kind of trigger word that

8380.2 --> 8384.16
you don't know and what if they didn't

8382.28 --> 8385.880000000001
REM what if they didn't revert it I mean

8384.16 --> 8388.359
then next thing you know this trigger

8385.88 --> 8390.039999999999
word that may be a common word that can

8388.359 --> 8391.84
trigger the whatever it is that make you

8390.04 --> 8394.0
thirsty they can do things that make you

8391.84 --> 8395.8
you know like thirsty or cotton up

8394.0 --> 8398.64
anything yeah you can be programmed you

8395.8 --> 8401.0
can be condition programmed that way

8398.64 --> 8404.08
yeah I'm not I'm not interested I'll

8401.0 --> 8406.28
pass right but you can wipe that all out

8404.08 --> 8408.8
though you just have to like Shake It

8406.28 --> 8411.960000000001
Loose again you have to shake loose that

8408.8 --> 8414.199999999999
frequency and then the associated things

8411.96 --> 8416.96
that are with that they yeah you can

8414.2 --> 8418.960000000001
basically unravel them and do them you

8416.96 --> 8422.438999999998
have to just be hypnotized in the same

8418.96 --> 8425.438999999998
way again to undo it see but it's about

8422.439 --> 8428.399
having the same hypnotic effect being

8425.439 --> 8431.24
done to you again to address that part

8428.399 --> 8433.64
where the program has set in to undo the

8431.24 --> 8436.76
programming now effectively you have to

8433.64 --> 8440.64
relive the trauma to get it to get the

8436.76 --> 8440.64
effect out it's just like with

8441.24 --> 8449.319
PTSD interesting isn't it

8445.76 --> 8449.319
yeah but yeah

8450.399 --> 8454.84
if you're lucky in life then you can

8452.479 --> 8456.358999999999
feel when something like that is trying

8454.84 --> 8459.24
is affecting you when something is

8456.359 --> 8462.2
trying to hypnotize you like a certain

8459.24 --> 8464.119999999999
thing that's just like freaking you out

8462.2 --> 8465.880000000001
if it like if if you get an extra

8464.12 --> 8467.720000000001
feeling beside your Consciousness

8465.88 --> 8469.56
getting confused from it or weird

8467.72 --> 8471.479
associations but you're like feeling

8469.56 --> 8474.279999999999
something

8471.479 --> 8476.56
like then you know somebody is

8474.28 --> 8479.52
attempting to basically hack you hack

8476.56 --> 8481.119999999999
your brain through rhythms or sounds or

8479.52 --> 8483.880000000001
effects

8481.12 --> 8486.240000000002
hypnotizing right yeah there's two

8483.88 --> 8489.039999999999
components of hypnotism there's the

8486.24 --> 8492.76
vibration the hip the effect the the

8489.04 --> 8495.76
Rhythm that's actually shaking you loose

8492.76 --> 8498.6
and then there is what do you do to keep

8495.76 --> 8501.2
your conscious attention away from that

8498.6 --> 8505.24
happening and doing that to

8501.2 --> 8509.6
you the side talk the old the old the

8505.24 --> 8512.56
old um watch going AC Cross or whatever

8509.6 --> 8514.880000000001
things that's that's they they that's

8512.56 --> 8517.68
old Tales you know look at keep your

8514.88 --> 8520.119999999999
eyes on the thing well there's there's a

8517.68 --> 8522.439
very but now they can do it they could

8520.12 --> 8524.359
do it like this guy does it on the

8522.439 --> 8526.76
street if he's really doing it and I I

8524.359 --> 8529.399000000001
would Grant it that he is he's not even

8526.76 --> 8531.04
using any devices he's just looking in

8529.399 --> 8532.8
people's eyes and he's saying things to

8531.04 --> 8535.84
them and I guess they have to like you

8532.8 --> 8537.92
said submit once they submitted then he

8535.84 --> 8541.6
literally just takes them over I'm like

8537.92 --> 8541.6
I'm not no I don't like

8542.0 --> 8546.68
that yeah I don't like that either it is

8544.76 --> 8549.6
it is a form of submission it's almost

8546.68 --> 8551.64
sexual it's intrusive in that sense well

8549.6 --> 8555.479000000001
there's a there's two movies out one

8551.64 --> 8557.84
starring Ben afflac that he just did and

8555.479 --> 8560.679999999998
um I forgot the name of it very good but

8557.84 --> 8562.16
it's like it's like Matrix meets um you

8560.68 --> 8563.56
know hypnotic whatever you want to call

8562.16 --> 8565.399
it and then there's another one about

8563.56 --> 8566.16
this woman who didn't even know she was

8565.399 --> 8569.319
being

8566.16 --> 8571.8
hypnotized and they were doing it you

8569.319 --> 8573.479
know without her even knowing it like

8571.8 --> 8575.119999999999
these people have these they have this

8573.479 --> 8577.039999999999
certain gift where they can literally

8575.12 --> 8579.12
hypnotize people just by being in the

8577.04 --> 8582.720000000001
same room like the way you can heal

8579.12 --> 8585.08
people from a distance they can do that

8582.72 --> 8587.279999999999
and literally control that person well

8585.08 --> 8590.72
but it's because of what they're because

8587.28 --> 8593.640000000001
of their radiation is what they are what

8590.72 --> 8595.88
they have it's like sometimes a person

8593.64 --> 8598.56
can be hypnotic just by feeling in a

8595.88 --> 8601.16
certain way and then they because

8598.56 --> 8603.72
everybody basically it's like everybody

8601.16 --> 8606.92
emanates light everybody emanates

8603.72 --> 8610.039999999999
nonvisible light on a cellular level

8606.92 --> 8613.8
based on where you're at your

8610.04 --> 8616.68
frequency right and that can be if

8613.8 --> 8619.519999999999
you're like really intense and like

8616.68 --> 8622.76
ideal or dominating then that can on a

8619.52 --> 8624.92
subconscious level just like make a part

8622.76 --> 8627.68
of you your subconscious like submit to

8624.92 --> 8630.279
that there's all these effects but it's

8627.68 --> 8632.08
really about the person like you can

8630.279 --> 8634.76
some people can literally like bring you

8632.08 --> 8637.72
to sleep by just saying like hypnotizing

8634.76 --> 8640.399
you to sleep well they're telling you

8637.72 --> 8643.119999999999
all these things but it's what they do

8640.399 --> 8646.479
with their voice

8643.12 --> 8650.08
like that's actually doing the hypnotic

8646.479 --> 8652.64
effect right it's the way they talk not

8650.08 --> 8654.8
what they say it's how they talk

8652.64 --> 8657.519999999999
frequency like frequencies where they do

8654.8 --> 8658.92
it sound effects and patterns

8657.52 --> 8662.880000000001
okay all

8658.92 --> 8665.68
that Rhythm sound effects patterns it's

8662.88 --> 8667.72
like unique sound

8665.68 --> 8670.399
influences and sometimes by the way

8667.72 --> 8672.08
smell can also be enormously influential

8670.399 --> 8676.319
like

8672.08 --> 8678.08
that cuz the smell brain is like big

8676.319 --> 8680.399
right that's why people can have like

8678.08 --> 8682.56
very detailed memories of something by

8680.399 --> 8684.84
smelling it and then literally Go Back

8682.56 --> 8687.399
40 years ago to a specific moment and

8684.84 --> 8690.2
remember exactly what they felt like

8687.399 --> 8693.84
because smell Association is very

8690.2 --> 8693.84
powerful in the brain

8694.76 --> 8700.12
right that's interesting because it's

8697.52 --> 8702.319000000001
almost like um they can do that while

8700.12 --> 8704.6
you're on the phone you can be

8702.319 --> 8706.319
hypnotized over the phone basically and

8704.6 --> 8709.68
that's probably why they say not only

8706.319 --> 8712.359
talking about the 432 Hertz and the 440

8709.68 --> 8715.319
Herz issue you know with the music the

8712.359 --> 8718.439
frequency of the music messing you up

8715.319 --> 8722.16
phys right

8718.439 --> 8724.359
but like like Cohen Cohen himself one

8722.16 --> 8727.64
the Bigg CE in the business oh you're

8724.359 --> 8730.24
breaking up 808 Bass Drum does

8727.64 --> 8732.399
something oh em I yeah you were breaking

8730.24 --> 8735.68
up a bit can you hear me yeah I can hear

8732.399 --> 8739.199999999999
you but I was going to say okay now hyp

8735.68 --> 8740.880000000001
hypnotism like you can get like

8739.2 --> 8743.720000000001
hypnotized by a

8740.88 --> 8745.438999999998
person if you already know them if you

8743.72 --> 8747.88
already been subjected to their

8745.439 --> 8750.880000000001
hypnotism then just by Association like

8747.88 --> 8752.72
knowing like oh it's them it brings back

8750.88 --> 8755.24
everything and then you can basically

8752.72 --> 8759.438999999998
initiate the hypnotism Yourself by just

8755.24 --> 8761.479
remembering it right by remember being

8759.439 --> 8764.0
hypnotized you can very easily

8761.479 --> 8766.24
reinitiate

8764.0 --> 8769.0
it doesn't that make

8766.24 --> 8772.319
sense yeah it's like oh I love this

8769.0 --> 8773.76
person he's always so hypnotic right and

8772.319 --> 8776.24
then he calls you up and then you

8773.76 --> 8778.800000000001
immediately get that again because you

8776.24 --> 8782.16
remember it

8778.8 --> 8784.119999999999
got you okay it that never works if

8782.16 --> 8786.119999999999
you've never met the person like if some

8784.12 --> 8788.12
hypnotist like called you up on the

8786.12 --> 8789.439
phone nothing about what he's going to

8788.12 --> 8792.359
try is going to

8789.439 --> 8795.08
work because it's the F you've never

8792.359 --> 8797.08
seen him right but if you know who he is

8795.08 --> 8798.64
like oh he's that hypnotist there's a

8797.08 --> 8800.64
much bigger chance it's going to work

8798.64 --> 8802.84
because you're anticipating and you

8800.64 --> 8806.119999999999
probably witnessed some of these

8802.84 --> 8808.76
influences doing things all right so if

8806.12 --> 8811.880000000001
you want if you were to break from the

8808.76 --> 8814.279
previous hypnotic state or need to be

8811.88 --> 8816.358999999999
cured you have to go right back to the

8814.279 --> 8818.84
same

8816.359 --> 8821.359
hypnosis or you you can get by you can

8818.84 --> 8822.6
get healed from someone else because you

8821.359 --> 8824.08
said they have to go to the you have to

8822.6 --> 8827.439
go through the same

8824.08 --> 8829.359
trauma trauma like what is the effect

8827.439 --> 8831.52
how did it get there if it gets planted

8829.359 --> 8835.0
it it gets planted during in hypnotic

8831.52 --> 8838.52
state to get it out you have to get to

8835.0 --> 8841.359
that same state again and with a plan

8838.52 --> 8844.359
with a plan like how do you address this

8841.359 --> 8847.52
how do you basically change that thing

8844.359 --> 8850.319
happening within that state right

8847.52 --> 8855.6
deprogram right and this is why hypnotic

8850.319 --> 8858.0
hypnosis therapy is also used in in PTSD

8855.6 --> 8861.0
right it is yeah because that's exactly

8858.0 --> 8864.16
what they do they make you go back with

8861.0 --> 8867.2
all the hell and all whatever it was and

8864.16 --> 8870.16
then they like now we have control

8867.2 --> 8872.479000000001
now we're going to change it around now

8870.16 --> 8874.479
it's going to be something else another

8872.479 --> 8876.76
way of seeing it another way of feeling

8874.479 --> 8880.96
it another way of responding to it and

8876.76 --> 8882.800000000001
now that new Dynamic is then implanted

8880.96 --> 8886.56
in those frequencies and then when you

8882.8 --> 8889.81
let it off the or original suggestions

8886.56 --> 8891.84
that were there should be

8889.81 --> 8894.319
[Music]

8891.84 --> 8897.76
gone that makes

8894.319 --> 8901.08
sense right by the way if

8897.76 --> 8903.76
I've never actually personally done

8901.08 --> 8906.72
this it's just logical that it should

8903.76 --> 8909.16
work like this based on things that I've

8906.72 --> 8911.72
learned of on frequencies and and and

8909.16 --> 8913.68
Trauma and PTSD because I what I just

8911.72 --> 8914.84
described I do know that it works like

8913.68 --> 8917.279
that with

8914.84 --> 8919.399
PTSD because it's really heavy right

8917.279 --> 8921.92
that's what makes it PTSD is that

8919.399 --> 8923.92
everybody has some level of PTSD is part

8921.92 --> 8926.64
of like how our memory and Consciousness

8923.92 --> 8929.12
works over time but it makes it really

8926.64 --> 8931.68
PTSD when it when the responses become

8929.12 --> 8933.92
overwhelming and night marish right

8931.68 --> 8936.04
that's when it becomes classified PTSD

8933.92 --> 8938.8
and you get a therapists and all that

8936.04 --> 8941.92
but everybody has it to some degree

8938.8 --> 8944.039999999999
everybody yeah starting at at at social

8941.92 --> 8946.84
communication it starts pretty much

8944.04 --> 8948.319000000001
everybody and and Humanity has had it

8946.84 --> 8952.439
ever since Humanity existed it's just

8948.319 --> 8956.039999999999
that it got coined for post War veterans

8952.439 --> 8958.439
recently in the 21st century but you

8956.04 --> 8960.640000000001
know and plus you know and of course now

8958.439 --> 8963.960000000001
they they put the coin on the veterans

8960.64 --> 8967.08
of Vietnam World War I the Ottoman

8963.96 --> 8969.24
Empire you go way back to you know you

8967.08 --> 8972.399
everybody had I don't the child on the

8969.24 --> 8975.84
street that that has to hear gunfire at

8972.399 --> 8977.599999999999
the basketball court okay I mean the the

8975.84 --> 8980.279
the the people hearing gunfire in the

8977.6 --> 8984.04
streets and seeing bodies that's all

8980.279 --> 8986.12
PTSD you know yeah before all that in

8984.04 --> 8987.160000000002
world wars they just called it shell

8986.12 --> 8990.319000000001
shock

8987.16 --> 8993.279
shell shock right it became PTSD during

8990.319 --> 8995.6
Vietnam because then when the

8993.279 --> 8997.800000000001
psychological Society was really

8995.6 --> 9001.68
Psychiatric Society was really trying to

8997.8 --> 9005.08
make a new move right yeah like getting

9001.68 --> 9008.479000000001
the DSM all standardized uniform

9005.08 --> 9011.84
everywhere and doing their thing that

9008.479 --> 9015.199999999999
eventually then led to now oh no no like

9011.84 --> 9017.76
gender dysphoria is perfectly normal now

9015.2 --> 9021.2
that's that's that's like one of the

9017.76 --> 9025.84
fruits from that maneuver of Psychiatry

9021.2 --> 9028.560000000001
slowly creeping up over the decades in

9025.84 --> 9030.76
society getting more problemin and and

9028.56 --> 9032.6
now they now we got trans kits thanks to

9030.76 --> 9034.92
them and don't and don't forget about

9032.6 --> 9036.08
the big farmer interjection yeah of

9034.92 --> 9039.6
course

9036.08 --> 9039.6
yeah how could I

9040.319 --> 9044.84
forget that's major that's they not

9043.52 --> 9047.16
going to tell you okay you take take

9044.84 --> 9050.84
this yeah psychiatric medicine

9047.16 --> 9053.24
yeah terrible stuff anti psychotics all

9050.84 --> 9055.56
kinds of sensory suppressants that's

9053.24 --> 9057.479
what they give you sensory suppressants

9055.56 --> 9060.92
make you literally

9057.479 --> 9062.08
dim literally dim dim with it dim your

9060.92 --> 9064.88
yeah they di

9062.08 --> 9066.8
desensitize yeah because if you're

9064.88 --> 9069.438999999998
desensitized well then you don't have

9066.8 --> 9072.119999999999
any flare ups which could lead to

9069.439 --> 9074.6
uncontrolled situations you're just

9072.12 --> 9076.92
drooling like a zombie it's very

9074.6 --> 9078.68
controllable yeah thanks

9076.92 --> 9082.24
psychiatrist we

9078.68 --> 9085.319
know how is that helping those people oh

9082.24 --> 9088.72
wait it isn't it's just putting them out

9085.319 --> 9090.84
of the way okay exact

9088.72 --> 9092.679999999998
exactly and and and you know what and

9090.84 --> 9096.64
that goes back what do they call it the

9092.68 --> 9098.319
segue full circle back to cannabis now

9096.64 --> 9101.399
the way cannabis makes

9098.319 --> 9105.359
me um paranoid and the

9101.399 --> 9108.84
anxious ver a lot of people say it calms

9105.359 --> 9111.68
them down it let them Rea um relax

9108.84 --> 9115.2
creative it does both so it starts with

9111.68 --> 9117.04
a poof and then you get the blanket

9115.2 --> 9119.359
right first she like oh what the [ __ ]

9117.04 --> 9121.160000000002
what the [ __ ] is this what's happening

9119.359 --> 9124.04
to me and then it's like oh oh oh wait

9121.16 --> 9126.8
oh yeah you go and after that I always

9124.04 --> 9129.240000000002
have that and and then after that

9126.8 --> 9133.24
is you

9129.24 --> 9136.08
sleep yeah sleep or just really mellow

9133.24 --> 9138.88
it's like you're just like so with that

9136.08 --> 9141.52
being say let's talk about the counter

9138.88 --> 9145.16
the counter indications and the adverse

9141.52 --> 9147.84
effects of those desensitizing chemical

9145.16 --> 9151.84
based drugs that big farmer uses versus

9147.84 --> 9153.279
someone having a nice um THC little

9151.84 --> 9157.56
Cannabis

9153.279 --> 9158.76
weed I think I think the ratio is higher

9157.56 --> 9160.56
I mean it's obvious you don't have to

9158.76 --> 9163.04
worry about liver damage you don't have

9160.56 --> 9164.519999999999
to worry about uh neurological damage

9163.04 --> 9165.68
you know all those little you know like

9164.52 --> 9168.880000000001
the guy that talks fast in the

9165.68 --> 9168.880000000001
commercial um don't

9169.12 --> 9174.399000000001
use and you you're reading it saying you

9172.2 --> 9176.640000000001
know if your balls swell up or if you

9174.399 --> 9178.039999999999
you bleed out the nose all these kind of

9176.64 --> 9180.72
yeah that crazy shit's never gonna

9178.04 --> 9182.359
happen yeah you know what I'm saying but

9180.72 --> 9185.8
with weed that's never gonna

9182.359 --> 9188.479000000001
happen never it's never gonna

9185.8 --> 9191.278999999999
happen yep now yeah you might have a

9188.479 --> 9194.599999999999
slight moment of discomfort at times or

9191.279 --> 9196.92
always that that happens for a bit but I

9194.6 --> 9199.2
mean it's very rare that people stay in

9196.92 --> 9200.88
that you have to have like that hypnotic

9199.2 --> 9203.2
effect right you have to have that

9200.88 --> 9206.358999999999
really terrible first time experience to

9203.2 --> 9209.6
have that every time permanently mhm if

9206.359 --> 9211.56
you didn't have that then you'll always

9209.6 --> 9213.720000000001
pretty much just have one very short

9211.56 --> 9216.039999999999
moment of discomfort and maybe slight

9213.72 --> 9218.599999999999
paranoia which could last from like a

9216.04 --> 9221.0
minute to maybe 15 minutes if it's

9218.6 --> 9224.04
really bad and it's always gone after

9221.0 --> 9226.92
that always it is unless you're H

9224.04 --> 9228.52
hypnotically set right

9226.92 --> 9229.960000000001
unless you have that terrible first

9228.52 --> 9232.560000000001
experience and then it will probably

9229.96 --> 9237.0
happen all the

9232.56 --> 9239.88
time and depends on your your temper

9237.0 --> 9241.64
anyway we're me and you are high strung

9239.88 --> 9243.92
people so that's probably why it affects

9241.64 --> 9245.96
me that way whereas somebody that's on

9243.92 --> 9247.68
that's on a lower level it kind of

9245.96 --> 9249.0
doesn't do that to them but if it does

9247.68 --> 9252.2
it does it to a lesser degree than it

9249.0 --> 9255.479
does me yeah I'm saying and then but I

9252.2 --> 9259.359
had a mechanic did everything under the

9255.479 --> 9262.76
influence of can right yeah yeah in

9259.359 --> 9264.720000000001
between doing breaks Sportsman too dude

9262.76 --> 9266.319
didn't you be taking a roach and taking

9264.72 --> 9268.199999999999
a few to you know what I'm saying

9266.319 --> 9271.359
functional did you know about was it

9268.2 --> 9273.399000000001
John Phelps that that swimmer that won

9271.359 --> 9277.16
the Olympics like a decade ago or

9273.399 --> 9279.92
something he would he would like puff

9277.16 --> 9282.84
some of that right before the game and

9279.92 --> 9282.84
he freaking won with

9283.0 --> 9286.88
that he was a recreational user but he

9285.399 --> 9289.199999999999
did it right before

9286.88 --> 9291.24
are you serious and he still killed them

9289.2 --> 9294.399000000001
yeah he won with that do you know the

9291.24 --> 9298.039999999999
physical wow yeah but it's because he

9294.399 --> 9300.199999999999
had really good quality uh like yeah so

9298.04 --> 9303.960000000001
he had exactly the right stuff for him

9300.2 --> 9307.399000000001
and it the thing is we we have cannaboid

9303.96 --> 9309.96
receptors that are specifically unique

9307.399 --> 9312.399
for the stuff that's only to be found

9309.96 --> 9315.24
most well not only but mostly to be

9312.399 --> 9317.358999999999
found in that specific plant right it it

9315.24 --> 9320.319
has all these

9317.359 --> 9320.319
really positive

9320.6 --> 9325.319
influences right but if you're not if

9323.399 --> 9328.599999999999
you don't have that if you're like as

9325.319 --> 9330.88
you say a more simple person or more

9328.6 --> 9333.56
poisoned over the generation so that

9330.88 --> 9336.519999999999
you're just kind of degraded and damaged

9333.56 --> 9339.439
well then it will probably just make you

9336.52 --> 9342.16
really dumb or really just really super

9339.439 --> 9344.2
high and it's like and then you think

9342.16 --> 9346.56
that's funny or something right like

9344.2 --> 9348.960000000001
really typical dumb stoners

9346.56 --> 9351.479
well it doesn't do that with people that

9348.96 --> 9353.679999999998
are really talented it doesn't do that

9351.479 --> 9356.16
at all well you know what's funny though

9353.68 --> 9358.52
but you know what's funny though I

9356.16 --> 9359.84
cannot I all my colleagues I mean you've

9358.52 --> 9362.24
even heard it especially in the

9359.84 --> 9366.279
especially you know in the rap game or

9362.24 --> 9369.56
you know the secular R&B everybody was

9366.279 --> 9372.76
at their highest creative level after

9369.56 --> 9375.439
indulging in something whether it was

9372.76 --> 9376.68
weed blow it doesn't matter what it was

9375.439 --> 9379.52
me

9376.68 --> 9382.880000000001
I become dysfunctional one time I tried

9379.52 --> 9387.439
to do it with a very famous um writer

9382.88 --> 9390.839999999998
Bobby called him Uncle Bobby um

9387.439 --> 9395.16
and dude I could not even remember

9390.84 --> 9398.479
lyrics I now I sound great according to

9395.16 --> 9400.72
him but I didn't I got paranoid I didn't

9398.479 --> 9403.479
feel good in the booth like I didn't

9400.72 --> 9404.88
feel myself I felt like disint him and

9403.479 --> 9406.56
there but I thought other people were

9404.88 --> 9408.319
coming in in the session kept looking

9406.56 --> 9410.359
out the booth like who who that he's

9408.319 --> 9411.519999999999
said man right you get distracted and

9410.359 --> 9413.640000000001
disjointed it doesn't make me feel

9411.52 --> 9416.399000000001
comfortable my greatest way is under

9413.64 --> 9418.16
sobriety where I'm at my best talent I

9416.399 --> 9421.0
just found it out and maybe don't get me

9418.16 --> 9423.96
wrong I may have like a a glass of some

9421.0 --> 9426.52
wine or maybe you know like I'm g hit

9423.96 --> 9429.199999999999
the hearts up um Grand Monier some type

9426.52 --> 9431.24
of you know that's like a um knnc I may

9429.2 --> 9433.68
have that to settle me down if I'm I'm a

9431.24 --> 9435.64
little bit on the nervous side but the

9433.68 --> 9437.56
with cannabis I couldn't do it that was

9435.64 --> 9439.199999999999
my first time and my last time that ever

9437.56 --> 9443.92
did that trying to function doing a

9439.2 --> 9447.04
studio session it just didn't work

9443.92 --> 9450.52
huh that's weird I mean like when I was

9447.04 --> 9452.04
younger like in my teens then yeah that

9450.52 --> 9454.24
when I smoked weed it would like

9452.04 --> 9456.68
seriously impede my abilities too

9454.24 --> 9458.6
because it just hit so hard hey I'm not

9456.68 --> 9460.2
hearing you what the hell why was it in

9458.6 --> 9461.56
mute okay now I'm hearing you what the

9460.2 --> 9464.800000000001
[ __ ] was

9461.56 --> 9467.56
that how the hell did it Go

9464.8 --> 9469.278999999999
mute was you hearing what I was saying

9467.56 --> 9470.84
yeah because I saw you on the screen

9469.279 --> 9472.560000000001
shaking your head so you heard what I

9470.84 --> 9475.399
said about the session going bad yeah

9472.56 --> 9478.278999999999
yeah I was but then I started to talk

9475.399 --> 9480.08
and it it w my Skype was on mute I don't

9478.279 --> 9481.6
know how the hell that happened I didn't

9480.08 --> 9484.52
even click

9481.6 --> 9487.68
it weird yeah so that was my first and

9484.52 --> 9489.439
last time I'll never do it again what

9487.68 --> 9491.04
that was my first and last time ever

9489.439 --> 9492.880000000001
creating well not only the time I told

9491.04 --> 9494.720000000001
you what my nephew would do oh right

9492.88 --> 9496.519999999999
yeah yeah yeah yeah but but you did it

9494.72 --> 9498.64
very young and you did it an action

9496.52 --> 9500.279
situation right this was before that

9498.64 --> 9502.64
experience with my nephew nephew-in-law

9500.279 --> 9505.319000000001
but this was back when I was recording

9502.64 --> 9507.68
and writing and it didn't go well I

9505.319 --> 9510.84
didn't like it now if you're not used to

9507.68 --> 9514.12
it and you're going to do it then for

9510.84 --> 9515.84
for something that's complicated man

9514.12 --> 9517.84
like I had a lot of issues too when I

9515.84 --> 9519.64
was like smoking I would just like get

9517.84 --> 9522.64
super inspired but then get too

9519.64 --> 9525.479
distracted to do anything and that was

9522.64 --> 9527.358999999999
my issue with it I I still have that a

9525.479 --> 9530.84
little but not as much because I'm just

9527.359 --> 9535.479000000001
used to smoking now so now it works just

9530.84 --> 9538.960000000001
fine and for me smoking makes it just it

9535.479 --> 9541.96
makes me less harsh because I can get

9538.96 --> 9545.8
like really just cold and

9541.96 --> 9545.8
dry if I don't get

9545.84 --> 9551.04
cannabis I'm just like less patient less

9548.72 --> 9554.319
tolerant and and it's that because

9551.04 --> 9556.84
that's how I Am Naturally really I have

9554.319 --> 9559.319
a soft side to me but I also have like I

9556.84 --> 9562.08
need this really rigid cold discipline

9559.319 --> 9566.278999999999
as well and that that comes

9562.08 --> 9566.279
afat when I don't smoke at

9566.359 --> 9574.04
all I become less tolerant and more

9571.2 --> 9574.04
rigid about

9574.479 --> 9581.16
things I never I never scaled that about

9577.16 --> 9582.84
me because I know in my sobriety State

9581.16 --> 9586.279
I've been told that I can

9582.84 --> 9589.84
be less tolerant and rigid

9586.279 --> 9592.560000000001
but I I don't know I guess when at the

9589.84 --> 9595.08
time that I did use a cannabis I guess

9592.56 --> 9596.439
was I more tolerant and less rigid but

9595.08 --> 9600.16
then I can't say that because the

9596.439 --> 9603.279
anxiety made me the paranoid anxiety

9600.16 --> 9605.479
kind of equates with being rigid and

9603.279 --> 9607.399000000001
intolerant no no no there nothing to do

9605.479 --> 9609.399
with that no no no that's completely

9607.399 --> 9611.479
different I don't want to go to the

9609.399 --> 9613.92
store yeah but that's completely

9611.479 --> 9616.84
different if you're paranoid that that's

9613.92 --> 9618.960000000001

black voice all right yeah it's it's a

9754.359 --> 9759.16
very black thing yeah it is that it's

9757.2 --> 9761.359
that thing it's like the same thing as

9759.16 --> 9763.24

9784.76 --> 9787.52
you have to do it you have to do his

9786.16 --> 9790.58
voice to do it you can't do it with a

9787.52 --> 9793.640000000001
duck voice you can't be going on my

9790.58 --> 9796.039999999999
[Music]

9793.64 --> 9798.519999999999
own you wouldn't do it

9796.04 --> 9800.0
but yeah okay who else who else who else

9798.52 --> 9802.0
um what's the guy Michael what's the guy

9800.0 --> 9805.24
that with the long hair he's on all the

9802.0 --> 9808.2
commercials right now um he he redid

9805.24 --> 9811.84
When a Man Loves a Woman that's another

9808.2 --> 9814.08
one he made that song when a man he he

9811.84 --> 9815.68
redid it but his name is Michael cson or

9814.08 --> 9816.8
something like that or I forgot his name

9815.68 --> 9819.2
but you know everybody know who he is he

9816.8 --> 9821.679999999998
got a big nose but anyway these These

9819.2 --> 9824.12
are so-called white guys they got the

9821.68 --> 9826.439
black sound too bro yeah there are some

9824.12 --> 9830.84
black gu or some white guys that can do

9826.439 --> 9833.08
it say it's a technique AR S no it's not

9830.84 --> 9835.52
it's not a technique it's just it's it's

9833.08 --> 9838.279
just a voice I mean you know no it is a

9835.52 --> 9840.84
technique it's the way you do it it

9838.279 --> 9843.479000000001
really is the way you do it I know I

9840.84 --> 9846.479
dude my mother was literally teacher at

9843.479 --> 9850.438999999998
the conserv conservatories

9846.479 --> 9853.0
so she and she was like into jazz things

9850.439 --> 9857.439
and like black voices white voices all

9853.0 --> 9860.359
over the world like it is a technique it

9857.439 --> 9863.2
is yeah like a black person can sing in

9860.359 --> 9865.720000000001
a non-black way it's just really

9863.2 --> 9868.720000000001
different and it's not as

9865.72 --> 9871.76
rewarding yeah because that black way of

9868.72 --> 9874.519999999999
singing is just it it gives more it's

9871.76 --> 9878.2
much more dynamic in nature than the

9874.52 --> 9881.399000000001
typical white way of singing it just is

9878.2 --> 9884.16
whites use much more the purity of her

9881.399 --> 9886.56
voice in some ways typically while

9884.16 --> 9890.039999999999
blacks they could always like play

9886.56 --> 9893.278999999999
around like jazz and things and it just

9890.04 --> 9895.76
works okay well here you it's talking

9893.279 --> 9899.0
too you if you ever noticed it's the

9895.76 --> 9903.08
it's it's it's it's called diaphragm

9899.0 --> 9905.24
chest and throat and nose you got to

9903.08 --> 9906.76
think of yourself your body your body's

9905.24 --> 9909.72
like a saxophone you have different

9906.76 --> 9910.800000000001
levels of where the where the air goes

9909.72 --> 9913.199999999999
through so you have some people that

9910.8 --> 9914.72
talk from the diaphragm and you have

9913.2 --> 9916.52
some people that talk from the chest and

9914.72 --> 9918.438999999998
sing and some people that talk from the

9916.52 --> 9920.92
throat and sing and talk from the no

9918.439 --> 9923.439
thing like I have a buddy named Rick now

9920.92 --> 9925.279
yeah you got to use it all yeah his his

9923.439 --> 9927.12
complexion is darker than mine but when

9925.279 --> 9929.12
he talks and the girl that I worked with

9927.12 --> 9931.04
answer the phone she didn't know that

9929.12 --> 9932.160000000002
Rick was a so-called black guy she

9931.04 --> 9934.2
thought he was white because he's like

9932.16 --> 9936.119999999999
hey how you doing is um is Rick there I

9934.2 --> 9940.240000000002
mean is Danny there because he talks

9936.12 --> 9942.08
like that okay now that's his

9940.24 --> 9943.88
professional way now I may be over

9942.08 --> 9946.08
exaggerating but it's it's really like

9943.88 --> 9948.0
it's very it's very into the throat it's

9946.08 --> 9950.72
a lot of the you know whereas you have

9948.0 --> 9954.479
some people um that talk like this they

9950.72 --> 9956.319
do a lot of Chess like um hey is um is

9954.479 --> 9958.72
Arn there that's from the chest and the

9956.319 --> 9961.24
diaphragm that's what it is a lot of

9958.72 --> 9963.438999999998
people in the church sing from the

9961.24 --> 9966.039999999999
diaphragm so a lot of it is and a lot of

9963.439 --> 9967.800000000001
the train singers even even Opera if you

9966.04 --> 9970.240000000002
notice opera singers they have those

9967.8 --> 9970.24
husky

9971.319 --> 9975.6
voices yeah yeah yeah dig I'm saying cuz

9974.04 --> 9977.080000000002
they sing from the diaphragm the chest

9975.6 --> 9979.319
they don't sing from the nose and I want

9977.08 --> 9981.359
to give shout out to F oats bro do you

9979.319 --> 9983.96
know that's that's there's three Idols

9981.359 --> 9986.16
in my life my father Bruce Lee and

9983.96 --> 9989.519999999999
Stevie Wonder and he just said original

9986.16 --> 9991.399
Stevie Wonder Rose I appreciate that

9989.52 --> 9995.12
bro big shout

9991.399 --> 9997.319
out yep martial arts is Bruce Lee

9995.12 --> 9999.68
martial arts in fatherhood is my father

9997.319 --> 10000.6
and music and singing is St wonder I got

9999.68 --> 10003.0
others but

10000.6 --> 10005.68
Steve yeah my mom was a fan of Steve

10003.0 --> 10007.92
Wonder too he's amazing man

10005.68 --> 10010.08
he's amaz not because he's blind to I'm

10007.92 --> 10011.8
right because he might not be blind it

10010.08 --> 10013.6
just doesn't matter because he's really

10011.8 --> 10016.599999999999
good at what he

10013.6 --> 10019.04
does but it's weird though like he is

10016.6 --> 10021.439
probably not actually blind but it's

10019.04 --> 10024.479000000001
weird it's just weird like why the hell

10021.439 --> 10027.08
would he do that then he's blind he's

10024.479 --> 10028.72
actually blind he is okay but there are

10027.08 --> 10031.12
rumors that he's basically like

10028.72 --> 10036.92
mimicking hand signs from the audience

10031.12 --> 10036.92
and [ __ ] so really yeah

10037.92 --> 10041.960000000001
yeah yeah it could be a conspiracy

10040.399 --> 10043.68
theory but it's the one that's going

10041.96 --> 10047.08
around for a while

10043.68 --> 10049.6
so yeah where it's like yay and they do

10047.08 --> 10052.359
a certain thing because it's the thing

10049.6 --> 10055.880000000001
and then he's like Yay I'm doing it too

10052.359 --> 10058.359
like he he suffered from um what they

10055.88 --> 10061.319
call premature retinopathy that's when a

10058.359 --> 10065.84
baby doesn't get enough oxygen while

10061.319 --> 10068.278999999999
they're being post neonatal or during

10065.84 --> 10070.359
pregnancy yeah and their eyes don't you

10068.279 --> 10071.880000000001
know develop all the way too so a lot of

10070.359 --> 10073.800000000001
their retina is not fully developed and

10071.88 --> 10075.119999999999
it's called retina um premature

10073.8 --> 10077.438999999998
retinopathy we have a lot we had a lot

10075.12 --> 10079.399000000001
of patients like that and it's very sad

10077.439 --> 10081.960000000001
it's so sad a lot of them are premature

10079.399 --> 10083.72
children he was a premium so that's

10081.96 --> 10084.96
that's how he got it but to say that

10083.72 --> 10087.479
when I told you about the memorial I

10084.96 --> 10089.56
just did Five O I had the I had the

10087.479 --> 10092.039999999999

10252.0 --> 10257.0
supposed to do

10253.239 --> 10262.0
sine no but no there's like three three

10257.0 --> 10265.56
types of batches officially the sine the

10262.0 --> 10268.6
uh the standard influence which is like

10265.56 --> 10271.039999999999
does give like weird yeah issues

10268.6 --> 10273.76
longterm might give you mtis and then

10271.04 --> 10275.479000000001
there's like the extra lethal batch that

10273.76 --> 10278.72
that that was that there too where

10275.479 --> 10281.56
people like get killed really Qui trials

10278.72 --> 10283.92
bro trials that's what a clinical trial

10281.56 --> 10286.8
is you give people Placebo saline you

10283.92 --> 10290.76
give people something with a certain

10286.8 --> 10292.479
um um um you know component ingredient

10290.76 --> 10294.6
level then you have someone with the

10292.479 --> 10296.92
higher level and you react to see how

10294.6 --> 10302.16
the rats act and we were literally rats

10296.92 --> 10303.76
and monkeys and lab mice yeah literally

10302.16 --> 10305.2
just to be Earnest and Frank about it

10303.76 --> 10308.2
literally

10305.2 --> 10310.720000000001
and depending on what state that being

10308.2 --> 10313.880000000001
United States or country nation state

10310.72 --> 10316.319
you were in what region you were in you

10313.88 --> 10318.08
got one of those batches so for you to

10316.319 --> 10319.88
say well it didn't happen yeah they got

10318.08 --> 10322.52
really political in the in the United

10319.88 --> 10325.839999999998
States really sick what makes me really

10322.52 --> 10329.12
sick is somebody says they had it under

10325.84 --> 10333.12
like they programmed it to be political

10329.12 --> 10335.359
I mean that's it's so disgusting it just

10333.12 --> 10337.560000000001
defies any

10335.359 --> 10340.319
Hollywood script even it's so [ __ ]

10337.56 --> 10343.039999999999
disgusting that they did that it defies

10340.319 --> 10344.96
a Hollywood script you can't write a

10343.04 --> 10347.12
story about it so messed

10344.96 --> 10349.358999999999
up but you know what makes it more

10347.12 --> 10352.04
disgusting not the ones that we know who

10349.359 --> 10354.880000000001
are already culpable of this nefarious

10352.04 --> 10356.6
Wicked malevolent thing it's the people

10354.88 --> 10359.039999999999
who you're trying to tell whether

10356.6 --> 10361.08
they're listening to this or whether or

10359.04 --> 10363.439
whether you're telling in person and

10361.08 --> 10365.16
they say to you cuz they don't know

10363.439 --> 10368.6
about the three batches

10365.16 --> 10370.64
they'll say well it didn't happen to me

10368.6 --> 10374.04
yeah well try it

10370.64 --> 10376.599999999999
again good luck yeah or they mock the

10374.04 --> 10379.12
ones who are at these Congressional

10376.6 --> 10380.08
hearings and talking to these attorneys

10379.12 --> 10382.68
you dig what I'm saying and they're

10380.08 --> 10385.16
saying hey my son is gone or look at my

10382.68 --> 10386.52
daughter or look at me these are mimed

10385.16 --> 10389.039999999999
people so you're telling me they're

10386.52 --> 10392.720000000001
lying they're making this up those are

10389.04 --> 10395.960000000001
the ones I I'm disgusted with yeah but

10392.72 --> 10398.84
the whole thing is so messed up

10395.96 --> 10402.08
because when it was being do out when

10398.84 --> 10404.960000000001
people were being pushed to do it as

10402.08 --> 10408.16
corporations were getting paid giant

10404.96 --> 10412.278999999999
sums to Dole out these

10408.16 --> 10415.039999999999
vaccines they were all like like it was

10412.279 --> 10417.84
all per definition like if you take this

10415.04 --> 10420.2
you take full responsibility for all the

10417.84 --> 10422.64
consequences it was like that from the

10420.2 --> 10424.52
start it's like right there is no

10422.64 --> 10428.239
repercussion yeah they didn't tell you

10424.52 --> 10431.560000000001
what was in it but you effectively did

10428.239 --> 10434.239
it anyway under an official guys of

10431.56 --> 10436.08
you're not going to get any recompense

10434.239 --> 10439.88
for whatever is going to happen right

10436.08 --> 10441.96
now it's like a Russian Roulette like

10439.88 --> 10443.96
there's nothing you can get out all

10441.96 --> 10446.599999999999
these people like oh I got this vaccine

10443.96 --> 10449.399
damage how dare they yeah that's you

10446.6 --> 10451.399000000001
it's you and you should have known that

10449.399 --> 10454.479
it's you it's all on you it's literally

10451.399 --> 10457.76
a Russian Roulette you don't have the

10454.479 --> 10461.08
right for anything because you took it

10457.76 --> 10463.2
and this is how it set up and yeah you

10461.08 --> 10464.88
didn't know that well you shouldn't have

10463.2 --> 10466.960000000001
taken it

10464.88 --> 10468.358999999999
then well that was the whole thing the

10466.96 --> 10472.08
whole thing of the weighing the pros and

10468.359 --> 10475.239
the cons the pros the cons

10472.08 --> 10479.08
were um being considered

10475.239 --> 10481.199999999999
misinformation and the pros was you

10479.08 --> 10484.96
could watch your ball game which is

10481.2 --> 10488.08
[ __ ] lame yeah ex yeah the the Pros

10484.96 --> 10489.839999999998
for it you look like it was almost like

10488.08 --> 10491.359
well if you don't get it this is what's

10489.84 --> 10493.239
going to happen to you you're going to

10491.359 --> 10495.52
see these people and they they staged

10493.239 --> 10498.439
and orchestrated the fake bodies in the

10495.52 --> 10500.560000000001
streets it was a man ridiculous it was

10498.439 --> 10502.0
it was unprecedented well know it wasn't

10500.56 --> 10504.72
because they did the same and yeah the

10502.0 --> 10507.04
fake filled up hospitals right the empty

10504.72 --> 10510.8
hospitals that were claimed to be full

10507.04 --> 10513.239000000001
that [ __ ] that was crazy man y y

10510.8 --> 10515.72
mannequins and body bags all these fake

10513.239 --> 10518.08
it was it's just it's so much man then

10515.72 --> 10520.119999999999
the dancing nursing videos and all that

10518.08 --> 10521.479
yeah yeah but what can you do now what

10520.12 --> 10523.84
can you do though you can't do nothing

10521.479 --> 10526.16
now yeah nothing just never take it

10523.84 --> 10528.72
again and like

10526.16 --> 10531.08
harshly verbally at least punish

10528.72 --> 10533.119999999999
somebody that's like hypnotized by this

10531.08 --> 10536.52
it's like you got to punish them like if

10533.12 --> 10540.239000000001
you do that it's like literally W

10536.52 --> 10542.239
walking into the mouth of moak by doing

10540.239 --> 10544.96
that like you're literally like

10542.239 --> 10547.16
sacrificing yourself to save

10544.96 --> 10549.239
by doing that and people need to

10547.16 --> 10553.279
understand that that that is what it is

10549.239 --> 10556.439
and nothing else I don't waste my time I

10553.279 --> 10559.560000000001
did it in 2020 2021 even part of 202 I

10556.439 --> 10562.960000000001
don't bother lecturing

10559.56 --> 10566.319
reprimanding being harshly Frank and to

10562.96 --> 10568.358999999999
the point to anyone that's an adult the

10566.319 --> 10571.76
only thing I've advocated from day one

10568.359 --> 10573.52
is keep your [ __ ] hands off the

10571.76 --> 10574.76
children and if you come near my

10573.52 --> 10575.68
children

10574.76 --> 10578.800000000001
you're

10575.68 --> 10581.960000000001
getting glocked in your chest and

10578.8 --> 10587.0
machete decapitated and I will take and

10581.96 --> 10589.8
I will take myself in to the

10587.0 --> 10591.52
authorities upon what I have done leave

10589.8 --> 10594.96
the children

10591.52 --> 10597.04
alone all right a parent take your own

10594.96 --> 10601.438999999998
child do what you want to do but

10597.04 --> 10605.279
teachers professors doctors nurses

10601.439 --> 10608.720000000001
uncles aunts other than that parent

10605.279 --> 10610.6
don't come don't come their mind bro and

10608.72 --> 10613.199999999999
that's what I stood on I stood on to the

10610.6 --> 10616.239
point where I was like yo I was ready to

10613.2 --> 10618.52
just like do the under the radar bro I

10616.239 --> 10619.8
was I was I was like looking like okay I

10618.52 --> 10622.04
need to start thinking like this is

10619.8 --> 10623.08
going to really be this is it this is

10622.04 --> 10625.6
where there's going to either be a

10623.08 --> 10628.56
revolution to the extreme or people are

10625.6 --> 10630.56
going to die yeah yeah no I'm with you

10628.56 --> 10634.239
mean I've been saying many times on my

10630.56 --> 10636.8
show like if you come with officers or

10634.239 --> 10638.8
whatever and try to like force a vaccine

10636.8 --> 10641.56
in me I'm going to kill you and make

10638.8 --> 10643.679999999998
sure that you are dead I've declared it

10641.56 --> 10646.119999999999
multiple times and I think that it's

10643.68 --> 10648.12
sort of backed too this what I said I

10646.12 --> 10650.640000000001
said we either catching cases or we

10648.12 --> 10652.319000000001
catching body bags yeah that it's like

10650.64 --> 10654.88
you're going to come for me well then

10652.319 --> 10657.039999999999
you're going to you are going to die or

10654.88 --> 10658.64
I'm going to die because I'm not just

10657.04 --> 10661.0
going to let you do

10658.64 --> 10664.039999999999
that but I don't not but I don't but I

10661.0 --> 10666.239
don't but I don't force anybody no adult

10664.04 --> 10667.6
I just tell them you know and I say

10666.239 --> 10669.76
don't hate the

10667.6 --> 10671.12
messenger I'm just telling you now you

10669.76 --> 10674.52
do what you want to

10671.12 --> 10676.960000000001
do you do what you want to do after

10674.52 --> 10679.640000000001
that right and I'm and I'm gonna have

10676.96 --> 10681.679999999998
hope and prayer that you do either by

10679.64 --> 10683.319
what if I planted a seed that made you

10681.68 --> 10684.960000000001
say let me see what this fool is talking

10683.319 --> 10687.8
about because he's so paranoid he's a

10684.96 --> 10688.96
conspir and maybe you will see the light

10687.8 --> 10691.319
right well I don't think there's going

10688.96 --> 10694.239
to be a lot of those people left I mean

10691.319 --> 10695.84
by now with all the V takers like

10694.239 --> 10697.52
everybody that's like all the families

10695.84 --> 10701.84
that have been really into it they've

10697.52 --> 10703.279
all had deaths all of them so like the

10701.84 --> 10705.319
only reason why you could still be

10703.279 --> 10707.960000000001
doubling down on it now is because you

10705.319 --> 10710.92
have some vested money interest or like

10707.96 --> 10713.119999999999
majorly blackmailed or something because

10710.92 --> 10716.279
there's no way that you could take it

10713.12 --> 10718.800000000001
now and not realize what it really is

10716.279 --> 10722.52
yeah yeah there's no way I mean it's

10718.8 --> 10724.72
it's the publishing information is all

10722.52 --> 10727.359
over the place like they can't can't

10724.72 --> 10729.319
they can't bury they can't burn the

10727.359 --> 10731.800000000001
reports quick enough for how much

10729.319 --> 10734.88
there's coming out about it right they

10731.8 --> 10736.16
can't they can't put the the memory hole

10734.88 --> 10739.88
is too

10736.16 --> 10742.0
stuck only please decrease influx it's

10739.88 --> 10743.438999999998
getting stuck there's too much stuff we

10742.0 --> 10746.04
have to shove in there it's getting

10743.439 --> 10748.56
stuck they can't get it in they can't

10746.04 --> 10755.160000000002
get it gone and and not only that in

10748.56 --> 10756.6
United States now the CDC FDA and um

10755.16 --> 10759.96
what FDA

10756.6 --> 10762.2
CDC yeah I think them and OSHA these are

10759.96 --> 10765.278999999999
the these are the entities here they're

10762.2 --> 10767.84
now throwing the subsidiary agencies of

10765.279 --> 10770.800000000001
Health departments and corporations who

10767.84 --> 10774.52
were M following the mandates which they

10770.8 --> 10776.119999999999
were told to exercise and execute upon

10774.52 --> 10778.04
employees now they're saying we never

10776.12 --> 10780.960000000001
told them to do that they're saving

10778.04 --> 10783.359

10795.92 --> 10799.88
the [ __ ] that was your

10864.439 --> 10868.92
States come together and protect those

10866.52 --> 10871.239
and get back people their lives and and

10868.92 --> 10874.68
their livelihoods who were wrongfully

10871.239 --> 10876.76
coerced and given ultimatums to either

10874.68 --> 10878.56
get on board get down or lay down that's

10876.76 --> 10880.279
what it was get down or lay down like

10878.56 --> 10882.84
State's property used to say the old rap

10880.279 --> 10885.76
group and and you can't do that you you

10882.84 --> 10887.52
you cannot do that bro let people take

10885.76 --> 10889.880000000001
it if they want to but you can't make

10887.52 --> 10892.239
them take it if they want to get Co and

10889.88 --> 10893.64
if they want to get Co and and and and

10892.239 --> 10896.239
and you want to say that they died of

10893.64 --> 10898.16
coid where they probably didn't then

10896.239 --> 10900.199999999999
that's your business don't make them

10898.16 --> 10902.56
yeah but it's like it's ridiculous

10900.2 --> 10905.560000000001
because like making somebody take a

10902.56 --> 10908.8
medical experiment or anything medical

10905.56 --> 10912.08
like mandated medical things are like

10908.8 --> 10914.0
that's like the number one top of the

10912.08 --> 10916.68
list thing that's like absolutely

10914.0 --> 10919.96
forbidden internationally like that's

10916.68 --> 10921.64
what the entire nberg trials even though

10919.96 --> 10924.119999999999
there A lot of it was actually a fake

10921.64 --> 10927.278999999999
out that's what they mostly were about

10924.12 --> 10931.279
like that's the the line they drew like

10927.279 --> 10932.560000000001
the mangala line like this is where you

10931.279 --> 10935.640000000001
go over the

10932.56 --> 10937.68
edge and that's exactly the edge that

10935.64 --> 10939.119999999999
they've been like dancing they've been

10937.68 --> 10941.880000000001
dancing on that edge and now they're

10939.12 --> 10942.720000000001
saying no no we didn't do that we didn't

10941.88 --> 10947.039999999999
tell

10942.72 --> 10949.119999999999
you holy [ __ ] yeah a tell them that tell

10947.04 --> 10950.76
them again Norberg tell them again spell

10949.12 --> 10953.68
it for they don't a lot of people don't

10950.76 --> 10954.880000000001
know about that yeah the nerur trials

10953.68 --> 10958.720000000001
right A lot of people don't know about

10954.88 --> 10962.519999999999
that yeah after World War II was ended

10958.72 --> 10966.199999999999
Germany lost supposedly and the well the

10962.52 --> 10967.52
Nazis basically got rounded up MH and

10966.2 --> 10970.960000000001
then

10967.52 --> 10974.08
tried for their crimes against humanity

10970.96 --> 10975.679999999998
and their own population war crimes and

10974.08 --> 10978.359
especially most

10975.68 --> 10981.439
notoriously medical experiments that

10978.359 --> 10983.640000000001
they did actually do on people very

10981.439 --> 10986.0
brutal and sometimes lethal medical

10983.64 --> 10989.319
experiments against their will they

10986.0 --> 10992.479
literally took imprisoned or enslaved

10989.319 --> 10994.76
arguably people and then just did that

10992.479 --> 10998.278999999999
involuntarily that

10994.76 --> 11000.16
is well that's like horrible that that

10998.279 --> 11001.720000000001
happened and it's like it came out that

11000.16 --> 11003.92
it happened in the detail it's like one

11001.72 --> 11006.319
of the the atrocities of the 20th

11003.92 --> 11008.2
century pretty much right and it was

11006.319 --> 11010.479
established through the international

11008.2 --> 11013.880000000001
court system like that that is the

11010.479 --> 11016.08
absolute line that nobody can cross like

11013.88 --> 11021.0
you can be a dictator but if you do that

11016.08 --> 11023.64
[ __ ] that will pretty much mean war that

11021.0 --> 11026.479
other countries will come after you them

11023.64 --> 11029.16
what war it was World War III Hitler

11026.479 --> 11032.599999999999
okay under Hitler mangala Dr mangala is

11029.16 --> 11034.239
the most notorious example of this not

11032.6 --> 11036.2
not not too long ago right about 100

11034.239 --> 11038.72
years ago maybe maybe a little less than

11036.2 --> 11041.08
100 years ago yeah about uh what is it

11038.72 --> 11042.96
80 something 80 some years ago well it

11041.08 --> 11046.08
was a whole period of time of course

11042.96 --> 11049.64
it's like between the the the 20 yeah

11046.08 --> 11055.279
between the 20s and 40s so it's it's

11049.64 --> 11058.319
roughly 100 it's 80 80 to years ago okay

11055.279 --> 11061.479000000001
so if it was the 1920s where we at

11058.319 --> 11065.399
now 2020s right we're

11061.479 --> 11068.119999999999
23 yeah so 100 years ago pretty much

11065.399 --> 11070.239
yeah so this is this is but the cycle

11068.12 --> 11072.76
though the cycle of repeating that the

11070.239 --> 11076.0
way that history Rhymes seems to be in a

11072.76 --> 11078.08
cycle of 80 years and not 100 years got

11076.0 --> 11081.56
you okay so we're right there we're in

11078.08 --> 11084.279
the middle of World War II yeah and we

11081.56 --> 11086.08
are in in there right except not

11084.279 --> 11088.04
everything is getting blown up it's

11086.08 --> 11090.439
because the war has shifted it's not a

11088.04 --> 11093.359
much physical War it's a psychological

11090.439 --> 11098.08
medical War now there's a term for it

11093.359 --> 11101.239
it's called quiet Wars silent weapons

11098.08 --> 11104.88
yes that's what it's called and Infowars

11101.239 --> 11107.199999999999
psychological warfare political Warfare

11104.88 --> 11109.72
political conspiracies

11107.2 --> 11111.880000000001
especially it's all about the political

11109.72 --> 11116.72
conspiracy like which political

11111.88 --> 11120.96
conspiracy are you a part off right

11116.72 --> 11123.72
Y and that's what's what's playing

11120.96 --> 11126.16
out what's getting duked out like the

11123.72 --> 11129.96
the bricks versus the United

11126.16 --> 11132.039999999999
States SL Israel and Europe and well

11129.96 --> 11135.278999999999
Europe sort of in the middle in between

11132.04 --> 11137.960000000001
all of the big guys getting pulled back

11135.279 --> 11137.960000000001
and forth like

11138.0 --> 11144.6
a like a little girl getting pulled back

11141.88 --> 11146.358999999999
and forth well see people don't even

11144.6 --> 11147.6
realize and understand the whole which I

11146.359 --> 11149.2
don't like to get into because they

11147.6 --> 11152.12
don't they don't they don't understand

11149.2 --> 11154.2
the whole situation with the um with the

11152.12 --> 11155.84
what you just spoke about and the whole

11154.2 --> 11157.16
relation to what's going on right now

11155.84 --> 11160.279
with the

11157.16 --> 11165.0
state state of

11160.279 --> 11169.08
Israel yeah established in 1948 but was

11165.0 --> 11173.52
already colonized Giza area of the

11169.08 --> 11177.76
Palestinian um area oh yeah back in back

11173.52 --> 11178.800000000001
was a very prosperous Nation ited since

11177.76 --> 11182.12
the late

11178.8 --> 11185.278999999999
1800s it was already by Refugee

11182.12 --> 11188.12
Russian so-called Jews long time ago

11185.279 --> 11192.439
after the Ottoman Empire demise so this

11188.12 --> 11193.279
this goes way back to a a situation that

11192.439 --> 11194.92
they

11193.279 --> 11199.12
use

11194.92 --> 11200.279
biblical whether it be t t or whatever

11199.12 --> 11202.960000000001
other

11200.279 --> 11205.84
books they used it as an inspiration but

11202.96 --> 11208.08
it's like it's actually widely discussed

11205.84 --> 11209.84
now that there's whole Jewish

11208.08 --> 11211.76
communities that are saying like no this

11209.84 --> 11213.880000000001
is a violation they are they've

11211.76 --> 11216.52
corrupted the entire interpretation

11213.88 --> 11220.319
they're trying to force prophecy when it

11216.52 --> 11221.960000000001
clearly can't be forced so they are evil

11220.319 --> 11224.278999999999
they're they're actually

11221.96 --> 11226.0
satanic y but I don't want to get into

11224.279 --> 11229.16
that I don't want to get your channel

11226.0 --> 11231.479
striped no but you can say that right

11229.16 --> 11234.239
okay as long as you don't uh as long as

11231.479 --> 11237.08
you don't like tell some kind of doomed

11234.239 --> 11238.68
end or whatever I know some people's

11237.08 --> 11242.2
channel that has been stried just for

11238.68 --> 11244.12
saying the JW word oh wow well I don't

11242.2 --> 11246.84
get that but I did get two strikes

11244.12 --> 11249.800000000001
recently like on this channel and on D

11246.84 --> 11253.0
life for basically saying like

11249.8 --> 11255.119999999999
oh I hate them all sort of and what I

11253.0 --> 11257.8
thought and I'm not going to go there

11255.12 --> 11260.279
again and I don't really hate them all I

11257.8 --> 11262.479
mean I was just at I even did that just

11260.279 --> 11265.16
because I was sick of all the all the

11262.479 --> 11268.479
people getting are you doing this are

11265.16 --> 11271.2
you I was just I hate that I don't even

11268.479 --> 11274.239
hate that region I don't hate those

11271.2 --> 11276.640000000001
people it's just that I hate all the

11274.239 --> 11278.6
people that suddenly come and come out

11276.64 --> 11280.56
and like I'm going to punish everybody

11278.6 --> 11283.04
that's the thing I hate about it that's

11280.56 --> 11286.479
what I hate so much about freaking

11283.04 --> 11288.479000000001
Israel and their conflicts every time

11286.479 --> 11290.84
all those people come out and just make

11288.479 --> 11294.039999999999
everybody's life miserable that's what I

11290.84 --> 11295.52
hate about it when you say when I say

11294.04 --> 11298.479000000001
this is what I tell my

11295.52 --> 11300.76
children baby I'm not mad at you I'm mad

11298.479 --> 11302.679999999998
at what you did and what you didn't do

11300.76 --> 11305.72
right that's how I look at it I don't

11302.68 --> 11308.960000000001
hate any human being I hate what some

11305.72 --> 11310.72
human beings do or even what they say

11308.96 --> 11312.358999999999
yeah but I don't hate the individual

11310.72 --> 11315.679999999998
because that same individual whether it

11312.359 --> 11319.56
be Hillary Clinton whether it be you

11315.68 --> 11323.12
know Stalin if they did something sweet

11319.56 --> 11325.0
you would say you like them be honest no

11323.12 --> 11328.0
were somebody no no listen to me listen

11325.0 --> 11330.56
to me I didn't say what they did that

11328.0 --> 11332.76
made you hate them if they did

11330.56 --> 11336.76
something

11332.76 --> 11339.239
benevolent and Humane do you hate any

11336.76 --> 11341.6
benevolent or Humane people I don't have

11339.239 --> 11344.319
any opinions about anyone unless I know

11341.6 --> 11346.960000000001
a wider context of their activity what

11344.319 --> 11350.439
if I know so you can't know somebody by

11346.96 --> 11353.08
one isolated action and I don't judge

11350.439 --> 11355.359
somebody on one isolated action only

11353.08 --> 11357.8
when you know the full spectrum of how

11355.359 --> 11359.04
they do things can you properly judge

11357.8 --> 11361.239
somebody's

11359.04 --> 11363.239000000001
action right but what I'm saying is I'm

11361.239 --> 11366.76
talking about I'm not talking about

11363.239 --> 11369.039999999999
consistent malevolence versus once in

11366.76 --> 11371.16
the Blue Moon malevolence like most of

11369.04 --> 11374.6
the time he goes and chops children's B

11371.16 --> 11378.319
babies heads off don't [ __ ] bring

11374.6 --> 11380.279
that up yeah bring it out no don't say

11378.319 --> 11381.76
you did say it don't do that I know I

11380.279 --> 11384.239
won't say it again I won't say it again

11381.76 --> 11386.68
what I'm saying I'm saying to you is I'm

11384.239 --> 11388.76
not talking about individuals that do

11386.68 --> 11391.16
bad things all the time and they do one

11388.76 --> 11392.72
good thing and you judge them or they do

11391.16 --> 11394.279
good things most of the time and do one

11392.72 --> 11397.0
bad thing and you judge them I'm just

11394.279 --> 11398.880000000001
talking about judging people by saying I

11397.0 --> 11401.279
hate this one I hate that one you don't

11398.88 --> 11404.679999999998
hate the person you hate what the person

11401.279 --> 11406.08
does yeah well that's a very sensible

11404.68 --> 11407.64
way of describing it that's what I'm

11406.08 --> 11408.92
saying all right right that's all I'm

11407.64 --> 11412.039999999999
saying because like I was giving you an

11408.92 --> 11414.16
example if someone like Jeffrey dhma had

11412.04 --> 11416.640000000001
not done what he did let's say he was

11414.16 --> 11419.64
like Mr Robinson it's a wonderful day in

11416.64 --> 11421.76
the neighborhood same guy and they

11419.64 --> 11425.119999999999
swapped

11421.76 --> 11426.800000000001
Deeds see that's why you can't judge the

11425.12 --> 11428.399000000001
person you have to judge what they do

11426.8 --> 11431.119999999999
that's why I love that one saying that

11428.399 --> 11433.16
Dr King said judge not a man by his by

11431.12 --> 11435.319000000001
by the color of his skin but by the

11433.16 --> 11437.279
Deeds his character that's how you judge

11435.319 --> 11439.199999999999
a human being when you do that and I'm

11437.279 --> 11440.2
not saying don't be prejudiced because

11439.2 --> 11441.479000000001
sometimes you have to be careful because

11440.2 --> 11443.0
there's certain people you got to look

11441.479 --> 11444.438999999998
at and be like I don't want to walk

11443.0 --> 11446.279
around there he looks like he's a little

11444.439 --> 11448.0
bit on the weird side you know because

11446.279 --> 11449.76
matter of fact a liberal guy just got

11448.0 --> 11451.76
stabbed to death young guy not even 30

11449.76 --> 11453.960000000001
years old he got stabbed by homeless guy

11451.76 --> 11456.0
he was always he was a liberal left he

11453.96 --> 11457.479
loved you know being communitive you

11456.0 --> 11460.399
know very conversive with people

11457.479 --> 11462.039999999999
strangers and he went over to ask this

11460.399 --> 11463.92
homeless person who had psychological

11462.04 --> 11465.52
problems hey you okay and ended up

11463.92 --> 11467.479
getting stabbed to death some people you

11465.52 --> 11469.76
have to have a Prejudice to and kind of

11467.479 --> 11473.08
stay leery of but I'm talking about as

11469.76 --> 11476.56
far as judging people in the way of I

11473.08 --> 11478.6
don't I I hate white people I hate black

11476.56 --> 11480.359
people I hate Hindus I hate I hate Jew

11478.6 --> 11482.960000000001
you can't do that you gotta hate what

11480.359 --> 11484.960000000001
they do hate what a person does you'll

11482.96 --> 11486.16
be better off making a better judgment

11484.96 --> 11488.358999999999
about

11486.16 --> 11490.239
somebody and you won't be blind and you

11488.359 --> 11493.319
won't be blindsided because imagine if

11490.239 --> 11494.84
every woman felt that every woman was

11493.319 --> 11496.84
was as loving as

11494.84 --> 11498.76
themsel they would be stabbed at the

11496.84 --> 11500.52
back by their fellow woman you know what

11498.76 --> 11502.52
I'm saying you got you do what I'm

11500.52 --> 11504.04
saying so you you can't do that or every

11502.52 --> 11505.399000000001
you you just have to judge people by

11504.04 --> 11508.04
their character so you don't get

11505.399 --> 11509.599999999999
blindsided by being optimistic about

11508.04 --> 11511.92
somebody because of the way they look or

11509.6 --> 11514.399000000001
what nation nationality they are as well

11511.92 --> 11517.0
as you don't want to you know you don't

11514.399 --> 11519.319
want to detach yourself from or exclude

11517.0 --> 11520.92
others based on their nationality or

11519.319 --> 11523.8
their skin color if everybody was like

11520.92 --> 11525.8
that we'd have a wonderful beautiful

11523.8 --> 11527.72
world look at the children in the

11525.8 --> 11529.479
daycare I I learned a lot when I watch

11527.72 --> 11531.358999999999
my children in the daycare and I see how

11529.479 --> 11534.519999999999
these children they don't even see

11531.359 --> 11536.92
that they're they're sharing

11534.52 --> 11539.0
lollipops and and and and and and

11536.92 --> 11540.319
touching you know huging each other

11539.0 --> 11542.239
because they don't know that they don't

11540.319 --> 11543.84
know no different they just look at it

11542.239 --> 11546.16
as like wow you're little like me you

11543.84 --> 11548.16
got little hands like me hi your hair is

11546.16 --> 11549.64
colored different but hey I like your

11548.16 --> 11551.359
kind of hair that's all they do they

11549.64 --> 11553.199999999999
they know they recognize the difference

11551.359 --> 11555.960000000001
within one another but they don't you

11553.2 --> 11559.0
know look at it like right you know was

11555.96 --> 11561.679999999998
another one like me that's how I used to

11559.0 --> 11564.239
see as a very little kid like oh another

11561.68 --> 11566.6
one like me but they're all turned off

11564.239 --> 11568.8
because they're dumb and they don't

11566.6 --> 11571.399000000001
actually know how to

11568.8 --> 11574.039999999999
talk I was like when I was six I was

11571.399 --> 11577.84
just frustrated at everybody like no why

11581.8 --> 11585.72
to have an adult

11583.6 --> 11588.279

11585.72 --> 11590.519999999999
wrong with these kids how old are you

11588.279 --> 11592.720000000001

11590.52 --> 11594.239
like yeah you know why your mother

11592.72 --> 11596.56

11594.239 --> 11599.359
they didn't do that that that did do

11596.56 --> 11601.278999999999
they talk to you yeah exactly that's how

11599.359 --> 11603.12
that's how I was raised and that's how

11601.279 --> 11606.399000000001
we raised out never do stupid little

11603.12 --> 11608.84
voice to babies never do it my wife

11606.399 --> 11610.64
despised it she said don't do that to my

11608.84 --> 11614.16
child all that how D you little baby

11610.64 --> 11615.76
doing your don't do that don't do that

11614.16 --> 11618.319
oh speaking of that did you know that

11615.76 --> 11619.800000000001
the mask the dawning of the Mask has

11618.319 --> 11622.56
caused a speech impediment and a

11619.8 --> 11624.72
language barrier and a and a voice o

11622.56 --> 11626.64
occupational therapy voice problem with

11624.72 --> 11628.84
children oh yeah yeah yeah yeah they

11626.64 --> 11630.88
have to little kids have to see your

11628.84 --> 11633.16
facial movements yes now they lowered

11630.88 --> 11636.199999999999
the standard so so this what they did

11633.16 --> 11638.359
this how they fixed it they lowered the

11636.2 --> 11640.439
standard so that now the children can

11638.359 --> 11643.56
still be passed because of their

11640.439 --> 11644.720000000001
underdeveloped um speech imped that's

11643.56 --> 11647.479
what they did in the United States

11644.72 --> 11649.88
that's how they fix it so they didn't

11647.479 --> 11651.88
fix it no they didn't fix it they just

11649.88 --> 11653.0
made children now so now shoved it under

11651.88 --> 11654.96

11678.64 --> 11683.64

11681.479 --> 11686.679999999998

I've had one 4our show but this is a

11694.64 --> 11699.199999999999
long one I like it but I did actually

11697.04 --> 11702.359
want to start the move towards rounding

11699.2 --> 11704.399000000001
it out it's gone 3 hours 12

11702.359 --> 11705.960000000001
minutes and it's getting kind of late

11704.399 --> 11709.199999999999
here and I kind of want

11705.96 --> 11711.88
lunch yeah I got to put a light fixture

11709.2 --> 11712.92
up yeah it's been an absolute Joy having

11711.88 --> 11715.358999999999
you on though

11712.92 --> 11717.56
no doubt man two and a half hours we've

11715.359 --> 11720.640000000001
been talk we've been talking here mostly

11717.56 --> 11723.92
you by the way dude you have stamina you

11720.64 --> 11725.599999999999
have talking stamina man thank you well

11723.92 --> 11728.359
I mean when the conversation's good I

11725.6 --> 11730.84
just like you know I like to just share

11728.359 --> 11734.16
share and it is it has been very good

11730.84 --> 11736.8
it's been a a lot of Joy having you on

11734.16 --> 11738.92
and definitely want to do that again

11736.8 --> 11741.16
next time though be be a little bit more

11738.92 --> 11744.0
careful with like what the words that

11741.16 --> 11745.8
you draw in even if it's like oh this is

11744.0 --> 11750.72
the latest thing everybody's heard about

11745.8 --> 11754.039999999999
it like the baby thing yeah yeah like I

11750.72 --> 11757.119999999999
never want to hear that ever just just

11754.04 --> 11759.279
so you know trying to really keep that

11757.12 --> 11761.640000000001
completely out of it because first of

11759.279 --> 11764.92
all I haven't seen anything like that

11761.64 --> 11767.439
personally and I totally distrust it and

11764.92 --> 11769.319
even if I go into it it would get really

11767.439 --> 11772.68
freaking dark and it would just make

11769.319 --> 11774.519999999999
everything even worse if I told you my

11772.68 --> 11776.16
actual thoughts about what's behind all

11774.52 --> 11778.199
that and I'mma give you I'm going give

11776.16 --> 11780.84
you my solemnly swear on both my

11778.199 --> 11784.239000000001
parents' grade when I said it when I

11780.84 --> 11786.52
said it I wasn't even thinking about the

11784.239 --> 11789.239
current I just said it to think of the

11786.52 --> 11790.479000000001
most weird thing all right fair enough

11789.239 --> 11794.0
and then when you said and when you said

11790.479 --> 11797.08
don't say it then it hit me like oh wow

11794.0 --> 11801.319
that's that's a sensitive spot right now

11797.08 --> 11804.479
yeah it is that's a serious like it's

11801.319 --> 11807.72
it's that that that [ __ ] came out has

11804.479 --> 11810.039999999999
like really like totally demolished a

11807.72 --> 11812.198999999999
lot of women's Hearts it's really

11810.04 --> 11814.76
terrible and I really wish that they

11812.199 --> 11816.76
just never did that I wish they never

11814.76 --> 11819.08
did it and I and I'm more so I wish it

11816.76 --> 11820.92
is just a slanderous defamation of

11819.08 --> 11823.039999999999
character

11820.92 --> 11824.84
accusation I'm praying that that's what

11823.04 --> 11827.279
that is just one of those things like

11824.84 --> 11830.56
you know a campaign smearing thing yeah

11827.279 --> 11832.76
yeah but it's it's so terrible I just I

11830.56 --> 11836.08
don't feel com

11832.76 --> 11839.56
enough to talk about it in public I will

11836.08 --> 11841.56

11839.56 --> 11844.519999999999
