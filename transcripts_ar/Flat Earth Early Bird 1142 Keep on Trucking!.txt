right so yeah sorry guys for starting a

99.96 --> 105.0
little late that's kind of a late night

102.299 --> 108.659

up until 1pm

109.86 --> 114.299
so yeah

112.2 --> 117.299
had a long sleep

114.299 --> 120.42
weather today is

117.299 --> 122.04
big gray soup Plus

120.42 --> 124.56
rain

122.04 --> 127.46000000000001
and a lot of wind and it's been like

124.56 --> 127.46000000000001
that all night

128.7 --> 132.35999999999999
like

130.14 --> 133.98
storming pretty much

132.36 --> 136.20000000000002
constantly

133.98 --> 140.78
and raining

136.2 --> 140.78
it's real yuck weather out there

142.94 --> 147.68
all right

145.08 --> 147.68
oh

149.7 --> 155.879
hello M first in chat keflar Wrath

153.78 --> 162.78
good to see you

155.879 --> 162.78
it is Monday the 31st of January 2022.

175.019 --> 177.62
so

178.14 --> 183.48
I've decided yesterday to basically

180.72 --> 186.35999999999999
unblock everybody

183.48 --> 187.92
in the list that doesn't mean that

186.36 --> 189.959
there's not going to be a lot of

187.92 --> 193.379
blocking again

189.959 --> 196.68
but yeah there's like a couple of people

193.379 --> 198.17999999999998
I wanted to unlock service day starters

196.68 --> 201.12
and raster hat

198.18 --> 204.84
and some others it's just that

201.12 --> 207.78
the list was so big it just I couldn't

204.84 --> 209.76
find anyone in it

207.78 --> 211.5
so I just thought like screw it just

209.76 --> 214.2
delete them all most of them are socks

211.5 --> 216.48
anyway forgotten about so it doesn't

214.2 --> 219.11999999999998
really matter

216.48 --> 220.61999999999998
anyway so today is everybody gets a new

219.12 --> 222.54
chance day

220.62 --> 224.09900000000002
thought that would be appropriate on the

222.54 --> 227.7
last day sort of

224.099 --> 231.07999999999998
The ancestral wins

227.7 --> 231.07999999999998
as I sized it up

231.659 --> 235.379
I've been

233.28 --> 237.06
from December

235.379 --> 241.04
two

237.06 --> 241.04
beginning of February right

242.459 --> 248.959
so we'll see what what brings

245.939 --> 248.959
what it will bring

251.459 --> 255.26
all right so how are you all doing

264.6 --> 269.24
I'm still kind of waking up a little

272.3 --> 276.199
buggy good to see you

276.6 --> 281.04
how are you today yesterday you said you

279.54 --> 284.24
had brain fog

281.04 --> 284.24
hope that's kind of over

289.139 --> 297.18
had a good chicken broccoli last night I

293.16 --> 299.88000000000005
started yeah I ate it pretty late that

297.18 --> 303.32
might have also been part of the reason

299.88 --> 303.32
why he overslept a bit

303.36 --> 308.36
doing good all right good to see good to

306.06 --> 308.36
hear that

315.06 --> 318.38
hey getting wisdom

321.5 --> 326.16
[Applause]

323.639 --> 329.0
so yeah yesterday's show thought it was

326.16 --> 329.0
really interesting

331.02 --> 335.94
or at least it was really interesting to

334.02 --> 341.29999999999995
me

335.94 --> 341.3
basically the title considering like

342.479 --> 348.25899999999996
things that I've learned through other

345.36 --> 348.259
people mind you

348.78 --> 352.25899999999996
about Jesus

350.58 --> 354.479
and

352.259 --> 356.52000000000004
then he was apparently heir to the

354.479 --> 358.139
throne of Rome and what would have

356.52 --> 361.38
happened

358.139 --> 364.139
if he'd actually taken that or did he

361.38 --> 366.12
actually take it

364.139 --> 369.96000000000004
and then afterward everything was

366.12 --> 371.639
Rewritten after he had died or

369.96 --> 373.38
I don't know

371.639 --> 375.06
how would that would have happened so

373.38 --> 376.979
yeah

375.06 --> 380.34
certainly was a

376.979 --> 383.71999999999997
an episode to make you think

380.34 --> 386.88
just like the one before that mind you

383.72 --> 389.46000000000004
100 and 1140

386.88 --> 392.1
for Horsemen of the eclipse

389.46 --> 396.5
it's also a thinker

392.1 --> 396.5
all right hey Jeff gasat good to see you

419.759 --> 423.02000000000004
oh Crockett

425.94 --> 429.5
how's the weather over there

430.44 --> 437.18
it's the snow storm in uh northeast

433.46 --> 437.18
America still going

442.139 --> 448.259
right so I was bit I have been watching

445.44 --> 450.9
Owen Benjamin especially yesterday I've

448.259 --> 452.40000000000003
watched a whole hours of it hours and

450.9 --> 455.4
hours

452.4 --> 459.06
but yeah he had a

455.4 --> 462.06
has been discussing the trucker

459.06 --> 465.84
Revolution you could call it

462.06 --> 468.9
would be a bit sarcastic

465.84 --> 471.479
with some other people

468.9 --> 474.479
and yeah

471.479 --> 476.94
because he thought look this is this

474.479 --> 480.539
seems like it's a

476.94 --> 484.259
it's a Jew operation because of well

480.539 --> 485.87899999999996
fund Runners and all that gofundme's

484.259 --> 490.44
but yeah

485.879 --> 492.78000000000003
maybe maybe he was and maybe myself too

490.44 --> 495.3
because I kind of did ride along with

492.78 --> 496.79999999999995
him like I basically took what he said

495.3 --> 498.90000000000003
and thought like yeah that's really

496.8 --> 501.0
sensible

498.9 --> 502.62
I don't trust it either

501.0 --> 505.099
because

502.62 --> 505.099
like

506.4 --> 513.18
well obvious reasons

509.639 --> 515.76
but maybe maybe there is something good

513.18 --> 517.56
about this after all maybe this is like

515.76 --> 520.3199999999999
a

517.56 --> 523.0799999999999
a bit of a media reset

520.32 --> 526.5600000000001
maybe a whole bunch of the the media

523.08 --> 528.48
Jews are now like okay okay

526.56 --> 531.959
we'll stop

528.48 --> 534.0600000000001
siding with the psychotic autographs

531.959 --> 535.8
that want to kind of like Get rid of all

534.06 --> 537.779
people anyway

535.8 --> 540.7199999999999
they don't really seem to particularly

537.779 --> 544.019
care about Jews anyway those great

540.72 --> 545.76
resetters right the proof is in the

544.019 --> 549.66
pudding

545.76 --> 551.399
or in yeah in the jab in Israel as well

549.66 --> 555.959
so

551.399 --> 560.06
maybe they have now switched back to the

555.959 --> 560.06
public side now how long would that last

561.839 --> 566.6400000000001
because do they deep inside really care

564.48 --> 568.62
or they do they just want to be on the

566.64 --> 571.5
winning side right

568.62 --> 574.519
so this whole trucker thing might be

571.5 --> 574.519
a good thing

574.92 --> 581.16
oh Trump is now backing the Convoy well

578.82 --> 584.94
yeah yeah slow mo yeah but he is right

581.16 --> 586.98
in the sense that you is definitely

584.94 --> 589.5600000000001
getting involved

586.98 --> 591.6800000000001
and making it into a media hype

589.56 --> 594.899
situation

591.68 --> 598.14
and the public kind of does want that

594.899 --> 600.66
right so that just again

598.14 --> 603.12
doing their thing

600.66 --> 604.62
but where will it lead to that's the big

603.12 --> 605.88
question what's it what is this all

604.62 --> 608.579
going to lead to

605.88 --> 611.399
because overall

608.579 --> 614.76
this kind of Convoy thing is gonna cost

611.399 --> 618.839
a lot of money for the fuel

614.76 --> 621.6
uh are they all going to get that back

618.839 --> 625.019
can they all actually afford it or do

621.6 --> 627.899
they let their enthusiasm and the moment

625.019 --> 630.24
drag them into it how will they all get

627.899 --> 631.92
out of it or is this actually gonna cost

630.24 --> 635.16
more

631.92 --> 638.04
truckers to go financially bust in the

635.16 --> 640.1999999999999
end of the ride you see

638.04 --> 642.66
that's my worry

640.2 --> 644.519
anyway despite all that there seems to

642.66 --> 646.26
be this whole thing going now in Europe

644.519 --> 648.36
as well

646.26 --> 650.279
the Netherlands immediately jumped in

648.36 --> 654.72
but then again yeah it's like

650.279 --> 659.1
Netherlands is like 50 Jews or something

654.72 --> 662.399
whatever that means anymore here

659.1 --> 664.6800000000001
so there's like trucker convoys here too

662.399 --> 667.26
that are starting to

664.68 --> 670.399
do the same thing here

667.26 --> 670.399
going to Belgium

675.959 --> 682.04
that you can claim expenses on a protest

679.56 --> 682.04
right

685.8 --> 691.8
hello by the way Stone monkey Len Lennox

688.8 --> 691.8
felx

693.3 --> 697.5
they made 8 million by now wow that went

696.3 --> 699.779
fast

697.5 --> 701.519
right but are what is going to happen

699.779 --> 703.5
with the money is that actually going to

701.519 --> 705.899
be sent

703.5 --> 707.16
is that actually gonna pay for the

705.899 --> 708.839
trucker

707.16 --> 710.279
Fuel and all that

708.839 --> 712.86
you know

710.279 --> 715.92
or they just is it right there to shine

712.86 --> 719.04
at you and be all hopeful and then when

715.92 --> 721.92
things go sour or whatever

719.04 --> 724.079
it's a leon

721.92 --> 726.5999999999999
and the guy that did it might just have

724.079 --> 728.3599999999999
like skip the country or something with

726.6 --> 730.38
them I don't know

728.36 --> 734.12
hopefully not

730.38 --> 734.12
right but you never really know

743.88 --> 748.38
we're going to starve us if the truckers

746.16 --> 752.04
keep protesting

748.38 --> 756.32
well it's going to block everything

752.04 --> 756.3199999999999
pretty much if it goes on for too long

768.3 --> 773.06
bobtail trucks burn very little fuel

770.579 --> 773.06
okay

775.38 --> 778.88
what's a bobtail truck

779.459 --> 783.079
I don't know that phraseology

794.29 --> 797.53
[Applause]

810.12 --> 818.22
okay yeah Google didn't really help that

814.62 --> 821.04
it is is called Bob trailing no trailer

818.22 --> 824.3000000000001
all right if they don't have a trailer

821.04 --> 824.3
if it's just the truck

825.0 --> 828.839
right yeah if they don't have a load

826.68 --> 832.8599999999999
they do burn less fuel it is true they

828.839 --> 834.3000000000001
still burn a bit though

832.86 --> 836.339
anyway

834.3 --> 838.4399999999999
good point George Sanford that is

836.339 --> 841.1
definitely worth considering in the

838.44 --> 841.1
whole setup

851.22 --> 857.72
yes love my moon buggy yeah the GoFundMe

854.339 --> 857.72
definitely did do that

858.12 --> 860.72
right

864.3 --> 870.26
but I think that the trucker protest is

867.48 --> 870.26
approved

870.42 --> 875.459
or profitable or something the re

872.94 --> 877.82
whatever the reason is they're letting

875.459 --> 877.8199999999999
it happen

886.92 --> 893.2199999999999
it could be this distract well

889.62 --> 896.16
it has to be a distraction for us all

893.22 --> 898.44
or it wouldn't be so hyped up

896.16 --> 901.639
now the trick is what is it distracting

898.44 --> 901.639
from right

915.42 --> 923.639
right maybe it is purely there to breed

919.199 --> 925.8599999999999
a sense of a false sense of victory

923.639 --> 928.8
like we're winning oh everybody's on our

925.86 --> 931.4590000000001
side and then like that actually means

928.8 --> 931.459
anything anymore

932.82 --> 938.639
although I did hear that and did see a

936.3 --> 941.7589999999999
photo I'm not sure if that was like

938.639 --> 944.1800000000001
assembled that was real but Trudeau

941.759 --> 949.62
hiding

944.18 --> 952.56
looking really scared hiding for it all

949.62 --> 956.899
so something is definitely or at least

952.56 --> 956.899
it's suggested to be getting to him

957.42 --> 964.579
but yeah Trudeau knows he's gone way way

961.38 --> 964.579
over the line

965.459 --> 971.2199999999999
I think it was mostly that time when he

967.92 --> 973.74
said like yeah I know we are

971.22 --> 975.6600000000001
by doing this we are violating your

973.74 --> 977.639
constitutional rights but we're gonna do

975.66 --> 980.6
it anyway I think that was the moment

977.639 --> 980.6
when he

981.0 --> 984.66
basically spilled the beans when he went

983.339 --> 986.519
too far

984.66 --> 990.139
and he feels that

986.519 --> 990.139
and everybody feels that

998.88 --> 1003.519
not just Canada

1000.68 --> 1003.519
yeah I know

1007.1 --> 1010.48
and Barry where's that

1025.579 --> 1029.98
oh Aussie

1027.38 --> 1029.98
cool

1030.199 --> 1036.5
wow I I'd be very curious to see if it

1033.74 --> 1040.299
would hit off in Australia that would be

1036.5 --> 1040.299
that would be something else

1041.419 --> 1046.88
that would be very interesting if it

1044.12 --> 1048.799
would actually hit off the whole trucker

1046.88 --> 1051.7990000000002
thing in

1048.799 --> 1051.799
in Australia

1068.84 --> 1075.26
right yeah George Sanford yeah that is

1072.799 --> 1076.6399999999999
I mean it's it's less glorious than a

1075.26 --> 1079.76
big parade

1076.64 --> 1082.94
right but you're right

1079.76 --> 1086.78
they could just like bring in the trucks

1082.94 --> 1088.8200000000002
and literally build a a giant wall of

1086.78 --> 1090.6789999999999
trucks surrounding key government

1088.82 --> 1092.96
buildings

1090.679 --> 1095.72
like literally build a wall so that no

1092.96 --> 1097.88
other vehicle can get past not even

1095.72 --> 1099.38
through a bike you could get through it

1097.88 --> 1101.3600000000001
right

1099.38 --> 1103.7
if you have enough trucks

1101.36 --> 1105.799
you could literally just build a giant

1103.7 --> 1107.98
barricade around an entire building like

1105.799 --> 1107.98
that

1112.28 --> 1115.34
and you wouldn't have it wouldn't have

1114.02 --> 1118.84
to cost fuel

1115.34 --> 1118.84
it would just cost time

1126.62 --> 1131.539
calmly and peacefully just take over the

1129.14 --> 1133.46
parliament yeah that's something else

1131.539 --> 1137.08
though Jared Sanford

1133.46 --> 1137.08
taking over the parliament

1138.74 --> 1144.32
wow what are they gonna do

1141.679 --> 1147.02
what are they gonna do after that

1144.32 --> 1150.82
what's that gonna accomplish right do

1147.02 --> 1150.82
they have somebody there to replace it

1154.58 --> 1158.96
I mean what are the the trucker's gonna

1156.679 --> 1160.2800000000002
take over the government

1158.96 --> 1162.98
uh

1160.28 --> 1164.96
what are they gonna do there

1162.98 --> 1167.679
I I don't think that that's a very

1164.96 --> 1167.679
bright idea

1170.14 --> 1175.0590000000002
unless they have literal well

1175.9 --> 1180.919
Statesman and all that ready to go ready

1179.24 --> 1183.5
to go and take it over

1180.919 --> 1185.8400000000001
right if that were the case well yeah

1183.5 --> 1188.539
maybe maybe

1185.84 --> 1191.62
if it's sufficiently organized but still

1188.539 --> 1191.62
all kind of risky

1213.679 --> 1218.48
they're gonna blame truckers for food

1215.84 --> 1219.799
shortages in the future oh do

1218.48 --> 1222.5
they

1219.799 --> 1225.44
the Communist scumbags

1222.5 --> 1227.179
great resetters yeah of course they will

1225.44 --> 1229.5800000000002
blame them

1227.179 --> 1231.74
they already kind of did though

1229.58 --> 1233.72
truckers have always been like a Target

1231.74 --> 1235.88
they always wanted to get rid of them

1233.72 --> 1239.679
for a long time

1235.88 --> 1239.679
for different various reasons

1245.78 --> 1249.28
wow okay

1254.659 --> 1259.2990000000002
yeah hi trolls I'm just gonna block you

1257.059 --> 1259.299
again

1272.539 --> 1275.539
bye

1275.659 --> 1280.96
yeah that was always gonna happen people

1278.24 --> 1280.96
with no life

1283.34 --> 1287.6
and you better damn well believe I am

1285.799 --> 1292.34
commenting on jobs

1287.6 --> 1294.86
because I want truckers to be able to

1292.34 --> 1297.08
keep their job

1294.86 --> 1298.2199999999998
or rather not even their job their

1297.08 --> 1300.74
function

1298.22 --> 1303.38
so yeah I'm I'm absolutely gonna comment

1300.74 --> 1306.08
on that I go to supermarkets

1303.38 --> 1308.0
so technically in a in a direct sense

1306.08 --> 1311.36
I'm

1308.0 --> 1314.539
dependent on Truckers

1311.36 --> 1318.559
now my state of

1314.539 --> 1320.9
uh of being employed doesn't really have

1318.559 --> 1325.1
anything to do with that I use a

1320.9 --> 1327.2
supermarket so I should realize that

1325.1 --> 1329.74
because of that I'm dependent on

1327.2 --> 1329.74
Truckers

1340.1 --> 1343.76
it's waking people up and giving them

1341.9 --> 1345.74
hope I don't think it's waking them up

1343.76 --> 1347.0
though clutch I mean it is giving them

1345.74 --> 1349.1
hope

1347.0 --> 1351.08
is it really waking it up

1349.1 --> 1354.86
I think everybody's already waking up

1351.08 --> 1356.6589999999999
for a while now and that's why it's

1354.86 --> 1359.78
giving them hope I don't think it's

1356.659 --> 1361.7600000000002
waking anybody up

1359.78 --> 1364.36
maybe giving them a little bit of

1361.76 --> 1364.36
Bravery

1366.2 --> 1370.5800000000002
that's about it

1367.96 --> 1372.8600000000001
everybody's already known that this is

1370.58 --> 1376.9399999999998
all garbage that this is I've got this

1372.86 --> 1379.6399999999999
has gone all wrong for two years

1376.94 --> 1382.159
the waking UPS already happen and and

1379.64 --> 1383.96
those that don't they will never wake up

1382.159 --> 1385.46
they'll never wake up even if you

1383.96 --> 1387.799
literally

1385.46 --> 1388.64
put a gun to their face they won't wake

1387.799 --> 1390.5
up

1388.64 --> 1392.72
they don't give yeah they're they're not

1390.5 --> 1395.539
there anymore and they're never they

1392.72 --> 1398.48
never will be they will never wake up

1395.539 --> 1400.52
they will die before they wake up right

1398.48 --> 1403.28
that's the other part

1400.52 --> 1407.4189999999999
but everybody else has any lick of sense

1403.28 --> 1411.28
is already woken up from all of this

1407.419 --> 1411.2800000000002
hey that flat fellow good to see you

1418.94 --> 1422.38
right so I yeah

1423.279 --> 1428.44
for moral purposes and all that I am

1426.62 --> 1431.4189999999999
going on the

1428.44 --> 1434.419
bandwagon or rather the truck

1431.419 --> 1438.26
I'm going on the back of that truck

1434.419 --> 1441.5590000000002
and say yeah go go Truckers

1438.26 --> 1444.02
I'm yeah in a way if if they manage to

1441.559 --> 1446.8999999999999
figure out how to do this without

1444.02 --> 1449.299
getting all the truckers

1446.9 --> 1452.24
bust

1449.299 --> 1454.52
or broke then I'm all for it right

1452.24 --> 1457.22
because that's my main concern that they

1454.52 --> 1459.1399999999999
don't accidentally get lured into some

1457.22 --> 1461.1200000000001
euphoric thing

1459.14 --> 1463.4
where they participate and then

1461.12 --> 1466.6399999999999
basically lose their truck in the end

1463.4 --> 1468.6200000000001
that's my biggest worries really as long

1466.64 --> 1469.7
as that doesn't happen I'm all cool with

1468.62 --> 1472.1
this

1469.7 --> 1474.559
like even if a bunch of Jews start like

1472.1 --> 1477.02
[ __ ] around and all that and getting

1474.559 --> 1478.94
old media squirty about it that's all

1477.02 --> 1481.58
fine as long as these truckers don't

1478.94 --> 1485.799
eventually end up losing their

1481.58 --> 1485.799
livelihood then I'm all good with it

1487.82 --> 1491.0
wow

1489.44 --> 1494.799
hear that wind

1491.0 --> 1494.799
is really storming out there

1496.76 --> 1500.559
hey Tony Whitcomb good to see you

1504.5 --> 1507.94
so yeah go Truckers

1508.159 --> 1513.0200000000002
got it a truck brought it unless you're

1510.86 --> 1515.1999999999998
a homesteader and you and you do it all

1513.02 --> 1515.2
yourself

1519.02 --> 1527.36
right but basically modern society or

1522.82 --> 1530.299
yeah considerably consumer Society

1527.36 --> 1532.6399999999999
it is it is dependent on trucks on

1530.299 --> 1534.3799999999999
Truckers

1532.64 --> 1537.5800000000002
if you make everything yourself you're

1534.38 --> 1537.5800000000002
not so dependent on them

1548.96 --> 1552.98
right mandates already made them moved

1550.94 --> 1555.02
it lose their livelihood yes I know

1552.98 --> 1558.08
that's that was the risk

1555.02 --> 1560.84
all I'm saying is I hope this is not

1558.08 --> 1563.36
just a bunch of squirting and they will

1560.84 --> 1566.6
actually have it back in the end

1563.36 --> 1569.6589999999999
because if not then this is like a giant

1566.6 --> 1571.82
tragedy that is mistaken

1569.659 --> 1573.98
for like oh this is a good situation

1571.82 --> 1576.5
we're winning yeah but not if they all

1573.98 --> 1580.279
literally lose their jobs in the end

1576.5 --> 1583.96
then it's a giant disaster

1580.279 --> 1583.96
right that was my point

1589.58 --> 1595.82
where did homesteaders get their goods

1592.7 --> 1598.039
yeah in the beginning Maybe

1595.82 --> 1599.539
if you want to do it quick

1598.039 --> 1600.919
it depends on how you're going to

1599.539 --> 1603.559
Homestead

1600.919 --> 1606.14
if you're literally going to build it

1603.559 --> 1608.12
like cut down the trees make the wood

1606.14 --> 1609.919
yourself build everything make the

1608.12 --> 1614.299
bricks make everything you can

1609.919 --> 1617.659
technically make absolutely everything

1614.299 --> 1620.84
completely on your own not needing any

1617.659 --> 1623.179
trucks but yeah trucks definitely do

1620.84 --> 1627.34
make it a lot easier

1623.179 --> 1627.3400000000001
that's why most people end up doing that

1628.4 --> 1631.0590000000002
foreign

1657.64 --> 1666.3400000000001
yes no I have not seen that

1661.52 --> 1666.34
20 mile high Sunset what

rent

1862.039 --> 1866.299
right

1863.6 --> 1869.799

still eat the rest of the month

1870.14 --> 1875.0800000000002
and that's that yeah that's not an

1872.419 --> 1875.0800000000002
exaggeration

so please

1877.22 --> 1882.22
please do support me through the PayPal

1879.44 --> 1882.22
especially

1884.0 --> 1888.98
that would be really really helpful

1887.0 --> 1892.48
I've been getting some

1888.98 --> 1892.48
good in last week

1896.179 --> 1903.039
if you can donate some just bits and

1900.2 --> 1903.039
pieces right

1903.2 --> 1908.8990000000001
just I don't know man see me as a a

1906.5 --> 1912.46
trucker in the in the spiritual realm or

1908.899 --> 1912.4599999999998
something if that helps

1924.919 --> 1931.279
and yeah the level that I've been

1928.58 --> 1934.039
handling and the the big things that

1931.279 --> 1936.44
have been trying to put down

1934.039 --> 1938.96
for everyone and everything to see

1936.44 --> 1942.3200000000002
because I have basically revealed things

1938.96 --> 1946.3990000000001
that I'm pretty sure nobody's ever even

1942.32 --> 1949.46
looked at the entirety of reality like

1946.399 --> 1951.5
that before I did that

1949.46 --> 1954.919
if you want me to continue doing that

1951.5 --> 1959.6
like as in the rest of the year at least

1954.919 --> 1963.3200000000002
then please support me I mean it

1959.6 --> 1965.299
it doesn't just come for free I'm I'm

1963.32 --> 1969.32
throwing it out there because I want to

1965.299 --> 1971.299
because I can but also because

1969.32 --> 1972.98
I hope

1971.299 --> 1976.7
and believe

1972.98 --> 1979.3990000000001
that I can get around with support

1976.7 --> 1981.679
if that's not gonna turn out to be the

1979.399 --> 1983.299
case then I will crash get really

1981.679 --> 1986.1200000000001
frustrated

1983.299 --> 1989.179
and then I will fizzle and then there

1986.12 --> 1991.6399999999999
will not be any more great ideas and

1989.179 --> 1995.419
that's just a fact that's not blackmail

1991.64 --> 1998.6000000000001
that's just a fact that's how it works

1995.419 --> 2000.8200000000002
I need the finances I really do

1998.6 --> 2004.6
and I'm a klutz I'm not going to get any

2000.82 --> 2007.6589999999999
better right donating to me doesn't mean

2004.6 --> 2009.8799999999999
that oh oh that means he is finally not

2007.659 --> 2012.46
going to be poor anymore no

2009.88 --> 2015.5800000000002
unfortunately not

2012.46 --> 2016.8400000000001
I mean you can get better at finances if

2015.58 --> 2021.519
you're already

2016.84 --> 2023.3799999999999
learning about that getting better at it

2021.519 --> 2025.24
I don't know maybe you're a crypto

2023.38 --> 2027.159
Wizard or something and you know how to

2025.24 --> 2029.019
tap in money or you're with the stock

2027.159 --> 2031.6000000000001
markets or whatever

2029.019 --> 2034.659
it's not something that I can't really

2031.6 --> 2037.84
do it would be way too distracting it

2034.659 --> 2040.48
would reroute my mind

2037.84 --> 2042.399
in a way that I wouldn't be able to do

2040.48 --> 2044.8600000000001
what I do anymore

2042.399 --> 2047.4399999999998
I wouldn't be able to dig as deep is if

2044.86 --> 2049.419
I did that and that's why I don't do

2047.44 --> 2052.599
that that's why I'm trusting on pretty

2049.419 --> 2055.359
much everybody else to do that

2052.599 --> 2058.78
and then hopefully you'll all chip in

2055.359 --> 2063.72
and I will be able to keep doing

2058.78 --> 2063.7200000000003
what I can do from this unique position

2065.859 --> 2072.0989999999997
so please guys and gals support me

2068.74 --> 2075.04

well that's just [ __ ] insane

2607.119 --> 2613.42
I mean they should be arrested

2610.839 --> 2617.02
straight up

2613.42 --> 2619.619
that's extremely dangerous

2617.02 --> 2619.619
like

2621.4 --> 2627.46
what do they want the they're not doing

2625.119 --> 2629.8
it like in front of their houses or

2627.46 --> 2631.9
anything right I mean that would

2629.8 --> 2636.0
literally be like asking a truck to

2631.9 --> 2636.0
literally drive right through your house

2636.64 --> 2641.8799999999997
some of these people there are just

2638.56 --> 2641.88
[ __ ] insane

2666.4 --> 2672.46
all right yeah but that's gonna that's

2669.099 --> 2675.76
gonna cause a whole bunch of [ __ ]

2672.46 --> 2679.839
that's gonna cause probably if they're

2675.76 --> 2682.6800000000003
literally doing that then they are being

2679.839 --> 2687.4
like the liberal rag doll

2682.68 --> 2688.8999999999996
literally asking to be beaten up

2687.4 --> 2691.48
because

2688.9 --> 2693.7000000000003
dude if I'd be a trucker I'd be on the

2691.48 --> 2695.98
parade and then literally drive over a

2693.7 --> 2698.14
bunch of nails because a bunch of insane

2695.98 --> 2700.8
people put them there

2698.14 --> 2702.8799999999997
if I'd be in a in a bad position

2700.8 --> 2705.3390000000004
emotionally I would get out of that

2702.88 --> 2707.079
truck and just beat the living [ __ ] out

2705.339 --> 2710.56
of those people

2707.079 --> 2712.7200000000003
like how [ __ ] dare you you scumbag we

2710.56 --> 2715.9
bring you your food you disgusting

2712.72 --> 2718.0789999999997
ninning piece of [ __ ] how [ __ ] dare

2715.9 --> 2718.079
you

2720.7 --> 2724.7799999999997
or just straight out call the police if

2722.98 --> 2726.9
they're still functional in any sort of

2724.78 --> 2726.9
way

2731.5 --> 2737.98
they are protesting over hello Lydia are

2735.7 --> 2740.2
you AI

2737.98 --> 2743.079
do you actually live in the physical

2740.2 --> 2746.819
real world

2743.079 --> 2746.819
if you ever come on

2769.18 --> 2775.48
right but yeah Nathan that's crazy

2772.48 --> 2777.4
you have any evidence of that I mean if

2775.48 --> 2781.72
that's like happening where you're at

2777.4 --> 2784.6600000000003
I'd literally call the police call the

2781.72 --> 2785.74
police tell them there's people insane

2784.66 --> 2790.5
people

2785.74 --> 2790.5
that are literally like trying to

2791.14 --> 2796.54
like attack the truckers

2794.319 --> 2799.9
they're attacking him by putting nails

2796.54 --> 2803.16
on the street that's [ __ ] insane and

2799.9 --> 2803.1600000000003
that's a crime I think

2804.46 --> 2810.28
so yeah

2806.079 --> 2814.0600000000004
there if you notice people putting like

2810.28 --> 2817.2400000000002
what is it the nails are

2814.06 --> 2819.839
what is it Spike mats

2817.24 --> 2822.22
which the police sometimes use for for

2819.839 --> 2825.7599999999998
fugitives and all that

2822.22 --> 2827.6189999999997
in cars but if if regular people are

2825.76 --> 2831.1600000000003
using that on trucks because they're

2827.619 --> 2833.92
[ __ ] insane numpy pieces of [ __ ]

2831.16 --> 2836.68
that would probably just just put them

2833.92 --> 2839.44
on an ice sheath and just shove them to

2836.68 --> 2842.68
the North Sea you know just get out of

2839.44 --> 2846.4
here you [ __ ] numpy piece of [ __ ]

2842.68 --> 2850.24
just die go away nobody needs you if you

2846.4 --> 2853.059
do that you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ]

2850.24 --> 2856.0
if you see that where you are at

2853.059 --> 2858.88
wherever you are in Canada or another if

2856.0 --> 2862.119
you see people do that [ __ ] call the

2858.88 --> 2862.119
police immediately

2862.72 --> 2868.0
do it call the police on them

2865.18 --> 2871.2999999999997
immediately

2868.0 --> 2874.78
because that's a huge dangerous Hazard

2871.3 --> 2878.5
and it's on incredibly illegal

2874.78 --> 2882.5400000000004
and evil it's not just illegal it's also

2878.5 --> 2882.54
[ __ ] evil and insane

2884.68 --> 2892.72
it falls under the category of throwing

2887.68 --> 2895.1189999999997
bricks and rocks off bridges on cars

2892.72 --> 2897.339
running underneath for fun it's that

2895.119 --> 2901.3
category of [ __ ] insane

2897.339 --> 2901.2999999999997
call the police immediately

2909.8 --> 2912.9790000000003
[Music]

2915.88 --> 2920.8
not sure why nobody could tell me that

2918.28 --> 2923.6800000000003
well because it's kind of crazy that

2920.8 --> 2924.819
you'd have to ask Lydia locks since it's

2923.68 --> 2928.2999999999997
like

2924.819 --> 2931.0589999999997
you can't even Escape that [ __ ]

2928.3 --> 2933.7000000000003
it's everywhere

2931.059 --> 2936.28
it's all over the new social media

2933.7 --> 2940.0589999999997
everything it's not gonna take long

2936.28 --> 2943.2400000000002
before Google is gonna have some front

2940.059 --> 2946.96
picture with a truck on it you know how

2943.24 --> 2948.819
they do their special day type of Google

2946.96 --> 2951.099
pictures well it's not gonna take long

2948.819 --> 2955.079
before it's gonna be a truck especially

2951.099 --> 2955.079
now that views have become involved

2956.14 --> 2963.359
so that's kind of bizarre that you that

2958.66 --> 2963.359
you didn't know about that Lydia logs

2978.099 --> 2980.28
foreign

3001.619 --> 3004.4

for some time

3095.64 --> 3098.9
out of that you know

3099.54 --> 3102.599
because in the end that's my biggest

3101.04 --> 3104.579
worries

3102.599 --> 3107.819
it's the food

3104.579 --> 3110.3390000000004
I mean smoking and all that has kind of

3107.819 --> 3112.2599999999998
become like second it's more like a

3110.339 --> 3113.7599999999998
luxury now I mean I wish I could just

3112.26 --> 3116.76
like

3113.76 --> 3118.98
[ __ ] cannabis all the time

3116.76 --> 3122.059
it's just not turning out to be like

3118.98 --> 3122.059
that right now

3124.619 --> 3128.1800000000003
but at least I can eat

yeah hey hey

3132.599 --> 3137.819
I'm gonna show that just to respond yeah

3135.9 --> 3139.8
hey hey

3137.819 --> 3141.66
who the hell calls themselves that

3139.8 --> 3143.819
psychopath yeah

3141.66 --> 3147.0
this is my job

3143.819 --> 3149.18
what I'm doing here media media is my

3147.0 --> 3149.18
job

3150.48 --> 3155.66
why don't you get a job

3153.599 --> 3157.88
or don't tell me

3155.66 --> 3160.98
nagging people

3157.88 --> 3163.5
anonymously like a troll is that your

3160.98 --> 3164.94
job you will actually get paid to do

3163.5 --> 3166.859
that

3164.94 --> 3168.96
I think you're just projecting I think

3166.859 --> 3171.359
these trolls telling me Oh I just get a

3168.96 --> 3173.579
job I think that they are the ones not

3171.359 --> 3176.7
actually having a job

3173.579 --> 3178.26
not actually achieving anything while

3176.7 --> 3182.22
not having a job

3178.26 --> 3184.44
not even having the motivation to try to

3182.22 --> 3186.0589999999997
achieve something to do something with

3184.44 --> 3189.9
their spare time that is creative

3186.059 --> 3191.94
productive that people actually want

3189.9 --> 3196.26
and you're projecting that on me because

3191.94 --> 3197.64
you're a useless piece of [ __ ] scumbag

3196.26 --> 3200.5200000000004
troll

3197.64 --> 3204.359
that probably doesn't have a job and

3200.52 --> 3207.78
that's why you're projecting that on me

3204.359 --> 3213.38
because this is my job

3207.78 --> 3213.38
I'm a YouTuber I do media

3213.599 --> 3219.96
I'm not super ambitious in a way

3216.839 --> 3223.92
although my ambition lies more in the

3219.96 --> 3225.96
intellectual region not in media itself

3223.92 --> 3229.5
I'm not like a

3225.96 --> 3230.64
an Alex Jones or something or an Owen

3229.5 --> 3233.76
Benjamin

3230.64 --> 3236.46
that really knows how to do that I hope

3233.76 --> 3237.9
and has like the perfect connections I

3236.46 --> 3239.88
have some connections though I got Adam

3237.9 --> 3242.4
Meek and I got an animation

3239.88 --> 3246.059
and a meeting is awesome to have

3242.4 --> 3247.579
every every Flat Earth YouTuber should

3246.059 --> 3249.3
have

3247.579 --> 3251.3390000000004
anatomiken

3249.3 --> 3253.559
unfortunately there's only one Adam

3251.339 --> 3258.619
meekin and he cannot

3253.559 --> 3258.619
Supply to every YouTube player

3259.5 --> 3265.2
right but this is my job

3262.8 --> 3269.2200000000003
and I effectively get paid for it

3265.2 --> 3272.64
officially right YouTube income that's

3269.22 --> 3274.319
official I register that to

3272.64 --> 3276.2999999999997
to my government

3274.319 --> 3279.18
so they could take it off my social

3276.3 --> 3281.76
welfare yeah but it is a job

3279.18 --> 3283.74
what is your job

3281.76 --> 3286.44
troll

3283.74 --> 3288.299
you get paid to Knack people to make

3286.44 --> 3291.559
everybody miserable you get paid for

3288.299 --> 3291.559
that I highly doubt it

3297.119 --> 3299.54
right

3301.74 --> 3306.9199999999996
limited availability indeed ah let me

3304.38 --> 3306.92
get my castle

3307.2 --> 3310.3999999999996

hmm

3341.22 --> 3346.14
check it out

3342.98 --> 3348.359
because it's a bit black but just a

3346.14 --> 3350.46
little I really have to figure out how

3348.359 --> 3353.339
to put how to warm these things up in

3350.46 --> 3356.9
the oven without scorching them slightly

3353.339 --> 3356.9
but they're still great though like this

3358.74 --> 3361.16
hmm

3371.7 --> 3374.0
foreign

3402.599 --> 3405.599
ASMR

3409.88 --> 3417.799

3415.619 --> 3421.1400000000003
Flat Earth okay that is just funny

3417.799 --> 3425.72

3429.9 --> 3436.94
an apj Cruise Shane good to see you

3432.9 --> 3436.94

3438.119 --> 3444.7200000000003
it looks darker than it is it's not like

3440.579 --> 3447.059
a genuine layer of of black it's just a

3444.72 --> 3450.0
tiny tiny top layer

3447.059 --> 3452.8190000000004
so maybe a little better but not really

3450.0 --> 3455.54
bad but I gotta figure out how to fine

3452.819 --> 3455.54
tune that better

3456.14 --> 3463.46
ah Skype shut up

3460.14 --> 3463.46
a bunch of blabbering

3469.559 --> 3475.1400000000003
right yeah timeout that's fine I was

3472.5 --> 3477.96
gonna bat him it's a stupid sock anyway

3475.14 --> 3480.24
but still even stupid socks can

3477.96 --> 3483.02
sometimes just manage to say something

3480.24 --> 3483.02
really funny

3484.26 --> 3487.94
like like he said

3488.04 --> 3494.64
crunch slurp show make more money than

3492.059 --> 3497.8190000000004
Flat Earth

3494.64 --> 3500.42
come on that is just funny

3497.819 --> 3500.42
it is

3530.46 --> 3533.059
foreign

3542.64 --> 3546.219
[Music]

3563.88 --> 3568.5
you should make it part of the show are

3566.22 --> 3571.859
we because the trigger Smurfs yes

3568.5 --> 3575.4
it does triggers a lot of Smurfs

3571.859 --> 3577.98
dude it used to be a whole thing

3575.4 --> 3580.6800000000003
did you know that in the early in the

3577.98 --> 3583.38
early early bird show days I would

3580.68 --> 3584.94
typically get a illuminati castle and

3583.38 --> 3587.76
then start out the show by eating it

3584.94 --> 3589.859
because I well I had to figure out

3587.76 --> 3591.96
something to fill it with I didn't have

3589.859 --> 3594.9
like a thing

3591.96 --> 3597.9
a discipline yet

3594.9 --> 3599.52
to yeah to always grab a subject right

3597.9 --> 3601.5
it was really tough at the beginning to

3599.52 --> 3605.28
do an early bird show every day it

3601.5 --> 3608.46
really was so yeah getting

3605.28 --> 3610.6800000000003
a tumera coffee and an Illuminati castle

3608.46 --> 3612.78
and just eating that and just chatting a

3610.68 --> 3615.5589999999997
bit was kind of part of the show as

3612.78 --> 3618.6600000000003
filler there were people that were just

3615.559 --> 3620.88
endlessly complain about it

3618.66 --> 3625.7
and yeah all these sock trolls came out

3620.88 --> 3625.7000000000003
of it they're just like oh slurp win and

3626.88 --> 3632.76
and just people obsessed and upset for

3630.72 --> 3634.859
some reason with me eating

3632.76 --> 3637.44
it's like oh my God

3634.859 --> 3640.2799999999997
how dare you eat on camera that's

3637.44 --> 3642.54
unheard of they were literally right

3640.28 --> 3646.26
entire messages

3642.54 --> 3649.799
trying to diplomatically explain why

3646.26 --> 3654.38
it's bad that I eat on camera serious

3649.799 --> 3654.38
some really weirdos out there

3657.599 --> 3660.839
right but anyway

3659.339 --> 3662.7
eating

3660.839 --> 3664.68
stuff

3662.7 --> 3666.8999999999996
is gonna cost money

3664.68 --> 3670.0789999999997
right it's kind of why I stopped the

3666.9 --> 3672.859
Illuminati Castle tradition because it

3670.079 --> 3672.8590000000004
cost me too much

3675.78 --> 3682.38
what's a Smurf no

3678.9 --> 3685.339
not Smurf is Smurf

3682.38 --> 3685.339
with a u

3688.619 --> 3691.099
h

3713.94 --> 3717.26
yeah anyway

3726.66 --> 3728.66
um

3729.0 --> 3731.72
really

3731.819 --> 3738.74
the sound of pouring tea is worse

3736.619 --> 3738.7400000000002
um

3744.24 --> 3747.24
foreign

3750.53 --> 3754.799
[Applause]

3752.099 --> 3758.78
you're still here

3754.799 --> 3758.78
aren't you huh

3760.039 --> 3766.8590000000004
I guess I I guess you are really like

3763.38 --> 3770.339
enjoying people scratching

3766.859 --> 3773.0989999999997
on chalkboards a lot because you are

3770.339 --> 3776.339
here in my chat complaining about it

3773.099 --> 3778.88
because you have no life obviously

3776.339 --> 3778.88
right

3779.299 --> 3783.14
he's a wiener

3783.359 --> 3786.98
right now that's gonna happen

3793.92 --> 3796.7000000000003
this

3804.839 --> 3809.96
right Chrissy beat so you are here in

3807.66 --> 3814.44
chat

3809.96 --> 3817.44
specifically still there having listened

3814.44 --> 3820.079
to me do that when you compared it to

3817.44 --> 3822.359
scratching Nails on a chalkboard yet

3820.079 --> 3825.78
you're there listening to it so do you

3822.359 --> 3827.46
have a Nails on chalkboard fetish

3825.78 --> 3830.1600000000003
then Chrissy B

3827.46 --> 3833.099
do you like

3830.16 --> 3835.319
like audio torture are you into audio

3833.099 --> 3836.839
torture is that why you hang around here

3835.319 --> 3839.4
because

3836.839 --> 3842.339
you equate

3839.4 --> 3845.64
pouring tea with that and you're still

3842.339 --> 3847.98
here in chat you're not like ah

3845.64 --> 3850.44
it would be the normal response from a

3847.98 --> 3853.079
normal person if they actually thought

3850.44 --> 3856.02
it was like nails on a chalkboard but

3853.079 --> 3858.119
you're here in chat still after I've

3856.02 --> 3859.15
done that right I'm doing it again right

3858.119 --> 3862.219
now

3859.15 --> 3862.219
[Applause]

3870.18 --> 3875.52
the person I'm with is watching you I

3872.94 --> 3879.68
have no choice

3875.52 --> 3879.68
okay so you're a slave then

3899.099 --> 3904.1600000000003
I mean can't you walk out of the room or

3901.98 --> 3904.16
something

3917.7 --> 3919.8799999999997
foreign

3953.94 --> 3956.78
I mean

3958.74 --> 3965.5789999999997
seriously it's Chrissy B like physically

3961.619 --> 3967.7400000000002
unable to walk away or to turn it off I

3965.579 --> 3970.94
mean are you like

3967.74 --> 3970.9399999999996
in the middle of some

3971.039 --> 3976.44
sex thing or something and you're like

3973.079 --> 3979.6800000000003
tied to the bed and your partner is like

3976.44 --> 3981.7200000000003
working on you while at the same time

3979.68 --> 3984.24
live streaming me

3981.72 --> 3986.0389999999998
and so you cannot physically turn it off

3984.24 --> 3987.5989999999997
because you have a ball gag in your

3986.039 --> 3989.94
mouth or something

3987.599 --> 3992.42
but you can still type though that's

3989.94 --> 3992.42
generous

3992.52 --> 3996.38
that's I I don't understand

4008.119 --> 4013.099
I mean I get the feeling you're just

4010.46 --> 4017.48
being kind of gamma and you actually

4013.099 --> 4020.059
like watching my show and listening

4017.48 --> 4021.859
but for some reason like pouring tea

4020.059 --> 4024.38
triggers you

4021.859 --> 4026.5389999999998
but you're but then to equate it to

4024.38 --> 4028.7000000000003
Nails on a chalkboard and then just

4026.539 --> 4032.059
still sit there and say no I have to

4028.7 --> 4034.72
listen because my partner is listening

4032.059 --> 4034.7200000000003
what

4037.94 --> 4045.64
does your partner actually join the chat

4041.18 --> 4045.64
is somebody in this chat your partner

4060.98 --> 4065.66
I don't get it

4063.619 --> 4067.9
I think most of it is just made up

4065.66 --> 4067.8999999999996
anyway

4072.319 --> 4077.14
heels on the road

4074.359 --> 4077.14
uh

4102.14 --> 4108.52
ah that girl sound was good

4104.48 --> 4108.5199999999995
I really enjoyed that

4144.319 --> 4149.299
oh

4146.9 --> 4152.799
right yeah Logan's Run referencing to

4149.299 --> 4152.799
what Nathan R said yeah yeah

4156.319 --> 4160.339000000001
it is worse

4158.359 --> 4162.799
the problem is is when you don't see it

4160.339 --> 4165.859
coming I mean Nails on a chalkboard you

4162.799 --> 4168.14
actually hear that it carries it's

4165.859 --> 4170.900000000001
terrible

4168.14 --> 4174.4400000000005
it's hard to not notice that now Nails

4170.9 --> 4176.7789999999995
on the road you yeah you'd have to see

4174.44 --> 4179.239
that coming

4176.779 --> 4182.080000000001
because it'll probably hit you right as

4179.239 --> 4182.08
as a surprise

4224.239 --> 4226.9
what

4231.08 --> 4235.42
the other Andrew are you like

4237.8 --> 4242.5
Chrissy B's boyfriend or something

4261.679 --> 4268.0
yeah never mind it sounds goofy [ __ ] at

4265.699 --> 4268.0
this point

4268.52 --> 4272.02
but there's time for that too

4273.56 --> 4278.56
don't always have to be so super super

4275.96 --> 4278.56
serious

4280.76 --> 4285.7390000000005
and it is kind of like an band day today

4284.06 --> 4288.14

4285.739 --> 4290.36
yeah everybody's unbanned from arwen's

4288.14 --> 4292.64
chat except those that got themselves

4290.36 --> 4295.239
banned Again by immediately acting like

4292.64 --> 4295.2390000000005
a gamma

4304.76 --> 4307.659000000001
foreign

4370.28 --> 4374.36
it's a pretty long show

4372.38 --> 4378.159000000001

4374.36 --> 4378.159
surface day I don't know he's not bad

4378.38 --> 4383.12
maybe he's just taking a day off

4383.12 --> 4385.78
really busy
