96.119 --> 100.5
right

97.619 --> 101.52
so yeah the weather today is uh turned

100.5 --> 104.64
around

101.52 --> 107.96
again pretty dramatically

104.64 --> 107.96
so now it's

108.0 --> 114.06
kind of clouds

110.579 --> 115.67999999999999
and and a lot of really clear blue sky

114.06 --> 118.259
up there

115.68 --> 119.7
and there's a lot of wind it's kind of

118.259 --> 121.74
storming

119.7 --> 123.06
although there's no branches breaking

121.74 --> 125.219
anywhere

123.06 --> 127.759
but I mean there's like a pretty heavy

125.219 --> 127.759
wind and

127.92 --> 134.52
beautiful Skies

131.039 --> 136.79999999999998
and some sun and it's actually not cold

134.52 --> 139.62
at all

136.8 --> 141.92000000000002
so it feels like much warmer than it did

139.62 --> 141.92000000000002
yesterday

142.14 --> 145.14
right

150.48 --> 154.7
hello alls first in chat

156.56 --> 161.0
15 38 time flies

163.739 --> 167.54
well time flies when you're having fun

168.739 --> 177.239
all right anyway it is Monday the 13th

173.459 --> 177.239
of March 2023

178.019 --> 180.98000000000002
check the weather

182.459 --> 188.34
17 degrees huh no wonder I felt it

186.12 --> 190.519
wasn't cold wow

188.34 --> 190.519
thank you

190.56 --> 197.18
man 17 degrees where did that come from

199.5 --> 204.12
according to the weather

201.959 --> 206.81900000000002
forecast it's going to get colder again

204.12 --> 210.18
and then Friday it might be 14 but 17

206.819 --> 213.92
degrees that is very unexpected

210.18 --> 213.92000000000002
no wonder I don't need any Heating

214.44 --> 219.49
right hello Scrooge

216.43 --> 219.49
[Music]

221.76 --> 227.29899999999998
right so yeah the the time has shifted

224.4 --> 227.299
in the United States

227.64 --> 230.599
so

230.76 --> 235.92
yeah I mean

233.459 --> 237.84
flat Earth's early bird show and Nathan

235.92 --> 240.35999999999999
show Flat Earth debates are gonna seem

237.84 --> 241.56
like an hour later to everybody in the

240.36 --> 244.08
United States

241.56 --> 247.739
because they're all an hour earlier

244.08 --> 250.43900000000002
right so that's going on

247.739 --> 255.659
also there seems to be a very serious

250.439 --> 258.9
Banks banking situation rolling out

255.659 --> 263.759
getting yeah there's like

258.9 --> 265.85999999999996
videos everywhere from a specialists

263.759 --> 269.16
saying that this is like a 2008

265.86 --> 273.02000000000004
situation repeating itself so

269.16 --> 273.02000000000004
yeah that's happening

280.979 --> 287.58
so another banking crisis Banks being

284.699 --> 290.0
unstable some banks apparently going

287.58 --> 290.0
bust

290.639 --> 294.96000000000004
more about the banking systems in

293.4 --> 298.94
general being revealed and what they

294.96 --> 298.94
have done even since 2008

299.12 --> 305.24
which is pretty much more of the same

302.22 --> 305.24
or even worse

307.44 --> 311.94
the so that's

310.02 --> 315.06
that's basically

311.94 --> 318.62
unfolding right now

315.06 --> 318.62
might continue on for a bit

323.34 --> 330.71999999999997
I mean during 2008 it was how long did

327.539 --> 333.419
it last that situation it was like a few

330.72 --> 336.08000000000004
months wasn't it

333.419 --> 336.08
foreign

340.56 --> 345.479
so that might last a few months it might

343.56 --> 347.22
go a lot quicker but I mean everybody

345.479 --> 349.86
already knows that

347.22 --> 351.18
whatever they're gonna do there's a lot

349.86 --> 354.18
of push

351.18 --> 356.88
from the banking

354.18 --> 359.40000000000003
groups themselves

356.88 --> 361.68
I think in some regions especially to

359.4 --> 364.13899999999995
like try to

361.68 --> 366.18
bring digital currency

364.139 --> 367.62
on everybody and they're planning that

366.18 --> 370.8
for the United States and they're

367.62 --> 372.84000000000003
planning that for Europe

370.8 --> 375.78000000000003
United States there's a bigger chance

372.84 --> 379.09999999999997
that that would actually happen

375.78 --> 379.09999999999997
than Europe I'd say

379.979 --> 385.94
because the United States banking is

382.5 --> 385.94
really super messy

386.28 --> 390.71999999999997
well yeah I mean at this point like oh

388.68 --> 393.6
but yeah it's more messy than our

390.72 --> 395.819
European bags yeah Miriam p and Max are

393.6 --> 396.96000000000004
also messy so I think I'm gonna stay out

395.819 --> 400.46000000000004
of it

396.96 --> 400.46
out of commenting I mean

401.05 --> 406.02000000000004
[Music]

404.039 --> 408.479
but it's happening

406.02 --> 413.06
and so there's going to be situations

408.479 --> 413.06
that are involved with that

415.08 --> 418.34
yeah cheap real estate

419.4 --> 423.96
there's all kinds of scuffles that will

421.5 --> 426.66
go on people will go bust and broke and

423.96 --> 430.88
others will like get

426.66 --> 430.88000000000005
more stuff really cheap

436.199 --> 441.72
yeah oh exactly

439.199 --> 444.74
where to get richer till is all its time

441.72 --> 444.74
it is true

444.96 --> 450.84
so yeah this is also the time that

448.08 --> 455.4
you're really kind of like oh yeah well

450.84 --> 458.58
if you don't support those things

455.4 --> 461.58
that you really want to

458.58 --> 464.06
to stay around then yeah you gotta

461.58 --> 464.06
support it

465.0 --> 470.52
you got to support those things that

467.759 --> 472.94
might be at risk

470.52 --> 472.94
right

473.28 --> 478.919
and I mean yeah whatever it's going on

476.099 --> 480.96
if somebody has something specific to

478.919 --> 483.539
say about it I will read it of course

480.96 --> 486.419
I'll get into it perhaps

483.539 --> 490.139
but me myself at this point I don't

486.419 --> 492.919
really have too much input or feedback

490.139 --> 492.919
of it

495.36 --> 498.86
concerning it anyway

508.68 --> 513.539
this is weird by the way I'm getting

511.8 --> 516.5600000000001
just

513.539 --> 516.56
not as much

518.399 --> 523.62
rollout and videos about like the

521.339 --> 525.5400000000001
Saturday protest as I expected there

523.62 --> 528.6
would be I mean I I actually looked

525.54 --> 532.38
around on Twitter a bit

528.6 --> 534.0600000000001
there is there are videos about it but I

532.38 --> 536.36
mean I thought it would be a lot more

534.06 --> 536.3599999999999
even

559.56 --> 562.56
foreign

564.86 --> 570.9590000000001
waves coming apparently a half a million

567.54 --> 574.0999999999999
people over half a million

570.959 --> 574.0999999999999
uh goody

581.7 --> 586.5
right but I mean everything whatever's

584.16 --> 588.66
rolling out whatever's happening people

586.5 --> 591.36
are now aware of the game that is being

588.66 --> 592.74
played on us

591.36 --> 596.279
it's kind of

592.74 --> 598.6800000000001
funny because like Alex Jones 10 years

596.279 --> 602.48
ago was literally rolling out like

598.68 --> 602.4799999999999
through he had their documents

602.88 --> 605.3
different

606.18 --> 609.9799999999999
Alex hacked the document

610.08 --> 613.26
right

611.58 --> 614.58
showed it

613.26 --> 616.14
what they were doing what they were

614.58 --> 617.519
planning how they were doing it how they

616.14 --> 620.16
were like

617.519 --> 623.24
basically creating like this migrant

620.16 --> 623.24
feedback loop

624.12 --> 630.0600000000001
and all that and that's happening I mean

626.399 --> 633.06
and people are very well aware of it now

630.06 --> 635.16
like oh you're going bust okay well then

633.06 --> 636.8389999999999
we're going to import new migrants like

635.16 --> 638.9399999999999
give them pretty much everything they

636.839 --> 641.7600000000001
want

638.94 --> 644.0400000000001
potentially they don't even really have

641.76 --> 646.38
to uphold the law

644.04 --> 649.26
that sort of thing while we all get

646.38 --> 651.779
Tighter and Tighter

649.26 --> 656.12
is replacement migration like

651.779 --> 656.12
involuntary replacement migration

656.459 --> 659.06
like

660.66 --> 666.899
right and it's not because oh but we

664.079 --> 670.3199999999999
suck so bad we really need them no it's

666.899 --> 673.32
like we would lots of people here

670.32 --> 676.519
would love to do all these things

673.32 --> 676.519
it's just that

677.04 --> 684.0
it's all being made so difficult

681.24 --> 686.839
right so this seriously all that

684.0 --> 686.839
migration

687.3 --> 693.8389999999999
those people are not just like oh good

691.26 --> 694.92
workers no no a lot of those people are

693.839 --> 698.8800000000001
actually

694.92 --> 701.16
have been groomed you could say in their

698.88 --> 703.459
respective country as to like oh that's

701.16 --> 706.1999999999999
that country you can go to and literally

703.459 --> 708.42
it's heaven and you can do whatever the

706.2 --> 710.4590000000001
hell you want and you don't

708.42 --> 712.9799999999999
and you yeah

710.459 --> 714.42
so there's literally among a lot of

712.98 --> 716.22
those people people that come here

714.42 --> 719.76
specifically

716.22 --> 722.519
to just exploit and and to not

719.76 --> 724.14
contribute to society to not become

722.519 --> 727.8
part of the country but to actually

724.14 --> 729.6
exploit its system they're being taught

727.8 --> 731.399
to do that

729.6 --> 734.76
those people

731.399 --> 737.399
that are really useless

734.76 --> 739.62
in general and bad attitudes they're

737.399 --> 742.019
they're being lured over here

739.62 --> 745.019
specifically

742.019 --> 748.14
to bug everything down

745.019 --> 751.4590000000001
that's that's real right I mean normal

748.14 --> 751.459
replacement migration

751.98 --> 757.14
like if if there is a situation like

754.14 --> 759.06
let's just get hypothetical like oh it's

757.14 --> 763.86
a small country

759.06 --> 766.4399999999999
uh there's like procreation issues I

763.86 --> 768.66
mean most logically happen with

766.44 --> 770.519
especially richer countries is that yeah

768.66 --> 772.3199999999999
people get too tied up

770.519 --> 774.54
with their work and they don't really

772.32 --> 777.1800000000001
want too many kids to get one kid it's

774.54 --> 778.8
like the story of Idiocracy right the

777.18 --> 781.56
rich couple

778.8 --> 785.8199999999999
trying to get a kid while like idiotic

781.56 --> 788.399
trash people get like 50 100 Kids

785.82 --> 790.5600000000001
spread out over three generations very

788.399 --> 792.839
so short after each other well yeah

790.56 --> 795.8389999999999
replacement migration is typically

792.839 --> 798.7790000000001
required to help that out right but then

795.839 --> 801.5400000000001
you pick the migrants as in oh can they

798.779 --> 803.9399999999999
actually adapt do they really want to

801.54 --> 805.3199999999999
work are they going to be beneficial to

803.94 --> 808.86
the country

805.32 --> 810.6
now that is logical

808.86 --> 813.92
and it's to keep it in Balance well

810.6 --> 813.9200000000001
that's not what they're doing

820.22 --> 825.779
right those aren't the people they're

824.04 --> 827.9399999999999
picking out

825.779 --> 830.04
they're luring across

827.94 --> 832.9200000000001
they're luring across people that are

830.04 --> 836.5999999999999
dominant disruptive aggressive

832.92 --> 836.5999999999999
and that don't give a [ __ ]

838.92 --> 843.779
I mean there are there's gonna be people

841.8 --> 845.8199999999999
among them that are like yeah yeah

843.779 --> 848.279
whatever we are actually going to be

845.82 --> 851.7
good laborers because that's how you do

848.279 --> 854.279
it right they might have some uh

851.7 --> 856.44
Muslim values

854.279 --> 858.899
that they just keep to themselves right

856.44 --> 860.5790000000001
so it's not going to be all bad but the

858.899 --> 862.98
problem is is that it's been kind of

860.579 --> 868.56
picked in a way

862.98 --> 873.2
those hordes of not being just workers

868.56 --> 873.1999999999999
they're luring across like trash

873.6 --> 877.9200000000001
that's real

875.339 --> 880.1990000000001
that's really happening and that is the

877.92 --> 882.54
thing that's so terrible about it right

880.199 --> 884.579
I mean if it was just regular

882.54 --> 886.92
replacement migration

884.579 --> 888.779
because westerners suck and they've all

886.92 --> 891.36
become gay and serve their own damn

888.779 --> 892.26
fault right I'd be like oh yeah yeah

891.36 --> 895.62
okay

892.26 --> 898.019
yeah you need some good workers

895.62 --> 900.36
that are that are not gonna be gay and

898.019 --> 901.98
that's interesting because that

900.36 --> 904.0790000000001
you know what I mean

901.98 --> 907.139
but that's not really happening

904.079 --> 909.06
they're like taking hordes of of just

907.139 --> 910.86
trashy people that are not gonna

909.06 --> 913.26
properly adapt

910.86 --> 916.639
and just shoving it in there now it's

913.26 --> 916.639
like now it's your problem

919.98 --> 926.12
and like I'm being oh like they make it

922.56 --> 926.1199999999999
the problem of the country

926.88 --> 932.88
of a local country of a local region and

929.519 --> 936.0600000000001
then if you protest against it then of

932.88 --> 938.579
course your racist Etc

936.06 --> 940.38
they make it our problem take trash

938.579 --> 943.5
people and they just dump them on you

940.38 --> 946.079
like you have to now deal with this

943.5 --> 948.3
can't just kick him out

946.079 --> 951.4799999999999
that's what they're doing it's it is

948.3 --> 954.3599999999999
absolutely unnatural

951.48 --> 958.0790000000001
I mean I don't think that even like the

954.36 --> 960.36
Soviet Russians even came close to doing

958.079 --> 963.3599999999999
something that

960.36 --> 963.36
nasty

969.12 --> 976.32
like that egregious that that attitude

973.019 --> 978.0
so this is all Way Beyond Soviet you

976.32 --> 980.4590000000001
know I like to sometimes compare it to

978.0 --> 983.1
Soviet just as certain people really

980.459 --> 985.5
like to compare it to Hitler

983.1 --> 988.5
and yeah I get it and that's actually

985.5 --> 989.3
logical in ways I mean look at what

988.5 --> 992.639
they're

989.3 --> 995.399
publicizing and all that so

992.639 --> 997.44
but I like to typically con compare the

995.399 --> 998.699
entire situation more to a Soviet

997.44 --> 1002.1800000000001
rollout

998.699 --> 1004.899
but what they're doing is technically

1002.18 --> 1004.899
worse

1011.0 --> 1013.6
anyway

1013.699 --> 1018.399
so yeah it's still gonna be three

1020.48 --> 1028.059
man wind is blowing hard

1024.02 --> 1028.059
anyway let's see who is in chat

1028.959 --> 1034.64
aholics anonymous

1031.64 --> 1037.419
let's go homeopath

1034.64 --> 1037.419
what where

1037.64 --> 1043.2990000000002
man this wind is really pulling like

1041.059 --> 1043.299
crazy

1049.299 --> 1054.32
like it's blowing straight through the

1052.1 --> 1055.6999999999998
house like even though doors and windows

1054.32 --> 1058.3999999999999
are closed it's just

1055.7 --> 1061.3400000000001
pushing through it

1058.4 --> 1063.76
literally pushing my door closed from

1061.34 --> 1063.76
the inside

1083.74 --> 1088.52
classical homeopath that's really [ __ ]

1086.78 --> 1091.52
up

1088.52 --> 1091.52
sarcasm

1098.36 --> 1104.4799999999998
no no this left is communist left and

1101.9 --> 1106.4
their money obsessions all they want

1104.48 --> 1109.16
they don't care they don't care about

1106.4 --> 1112.3400000000001
Nations they don't care about peoples

1109.16 --> 1115.66
they only care about power and about

1112.34 --> 1115.6599999999999
slave workers

1119.059 --> 1126.2
I I genuinely believe that

1122.66 --> 1127.8200000000002
these leftists these yeah these power

1126.2 --> 1130.7
people

1127.82 --> 1132.3799999999999
World economic Forum related people and

1130.7 --> 1135.919
all their following

1132.38 --> 1139.88
I think that they genuinely see

1135.919 --> 1142.4
just the people as slaves that they need

1139.88 --> 1146.3600000000001
to tame get under control that's how

1142.4 --> 1148.76
they see people I really believe that

1146.36 --> 1151.6399999999999
right method of slavery is mind control

1148.76 --> 1154.46
so it's not whips and change it's change

1151.64 --> 1157.46
it's mind control and they genuinely

1154.46 --> 1160.039
regard everybody as slave that they just

1157.46 --> 1162.98
need to trick into obeying them

1160.039 --> 1165.32
that's how they see people now

1162.98 --> 1167.5
that's what it feels like it's what it

1165.32 --> 1167.5
is

1171.38 --> 1177.3200000000002
there they want to usher in a new age of

1174.799 --> 1179.84
slavery

1177.32 --> 1181.7
like on top of Freedom like you have the

1179.84 --> 1184.4599999999998
freedom to be a Slave

1181.7 --> 1188.2
if you're stupid enough to fall for that

1184.46 --> 1188.2
because it's very hard not to

1196.1 --> 1200.1999999999998
because you'll be tricked into it

1201.98 --> 1206.0
right and I mean it's it's weird because

1204.32 --> 1209.6599999999999
in the past

1206.0 --> 1212.12
people could have been like bought into

1209.66 --> 1215.539
slavery like they might sell their own

1212.12 --> 1218.4189999999999
family Etc because even back then the

1215.539 --> 1221.419
people's highly over exaggerate things

1218.419 --> 1223.7
from the past because back then

1221.419 --> 1225.98
being a slave relatively wasn't even

1223.7 --> 1229.46
that bad compared to being completely

1225.98 --> 1232.88
destitute and everybody's hungry

1229.46 --> 1235.1000000000001
because slaves had rights too

1232.88 --> 1237.7990000000002
does oh well yeah yeah because it was

1235.1 --> 1239.299
actually a legal mechanism also it's not

1237.799 --> 1242.9
just oh

1239.299 --> 1245.0
like you're a slave to me so I can do

1242.9 --> 1248.7800000000002
with you whatever I want

1245.0 --> 1251.48
there were rules and they were lost

1248.78 --> 1254.12
and so

1251.48 --> 1257.9
selling somebody as a slave would not

1254.12 --> 1259.82
mean they're dead now

1257.9 --> 1261.919
that didn't mean that

1259.82 --> 1265.12
I'm talking like two three hundred years

1261.919 --> 1265.1200000000001
ago it was different

1268.88 --> 1275.96
right but now

1272.24 --> 1279.6200000000001
like that's not possible really anymore

1275.96 --> 1282.08
so now what they do is they do it on the

1279.62 --> 1285.9799999999998
layer on top of it

1282.08 --> 1288.32
on the mental spiritual side to trick

1285.98 --> 1291.58
people into becoming their slaves by

1288.32 --> 1291.58
doing their methods

1293.84 --> 1300.5
which are destructive towards Society

1296.44 --> 1302.539
towards the cohesion nationalism

1300.5 --> 1306.559
spiritual cohesion

1302.539 --> 1309.98
Roots all of that so it's just Marxist

1306.559 --> 1312.62
mind control and that is slavery I mean

1309.98 --> 1315.08
when you're on on that you are a slave

1312.62 --> 1317.1789999999999
you might get benefits too but you are a

1315.08 --> 1319.1
slave you're a slave with benefits if

1317.179 --> 1321.14
you're part of their system

1319.1 --> 1322.82
but they love to project that and say

1321.14 --> 1325.88
like no no we're not the slaves now

1322.82 --> 1328.4189999999999
everybody else are our slaves

1325.88 --> 1328.419
really

1330.799 --> 1335.72
right and they're just supposed to do

1332.84 --> 1339.039
what we want but not realize

1335.72 --> 1339.039
that they're slaves

1339.62 --> 1345.86
unless we need to like really in a

1342.98 --> 1348.38
moment demoralize them when we have a

1345.86 --> 1350.4189999999999
full graphs grasp so that they know like

1348.38 --> 1352.159
yeah you can't actually resist us so

1350.419 --> 1353.72
they might just like no you are slaves

1352.159 --> 1355.4
let's see at the moment but in general

1353.72 --> 1358.9
they don't want everybody to be

1355.4 --> 1358.9
pondering upon that all the time

1358.94 --> 1363.14
right

1360.32 --> 1365.4189999999999
it says this is like spiritual covert

1363.14 --> 1367.88
slavery and they really do think that

1365.419 --> 1370.5200000000002
everybody is their slaves

1367.88 --> 1372.2600000000002
I I genuinely believe that I think that

1370.52 --> 1375.2
there will be people out there that

1372.26 --> 1377.98
could confirm that

1375.2 --> 1377.98
foreign

1380.14 --> 1386.7800000000002
are like pets zoo animals

1384.32 --> 1389.6
they don't see people all the other

1386.78 --> 1393.26
people as equals that's for sure

1389.6 --> 1394.52
other people are there to exploit

1393.26 --> 1397.4
into

1394.52 --> 1400.6589999999999
push around and manipulate so that they

1397.4 --> 1400.659
go and do what you want

1424.159 --> 1430.0590000000002
okay well I don't know what you're

1426.559 --> 1430.059
talking about who what where

1445.58 --> 1449.6789999999999
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

1471.679 --> 1477.3200000000002
is anybody else still here I mean I got

1474.26 --> 1480.3799999999999
two alleged Ballers here that are just

1477.32 --> 1482.78
talking about something else and

1480.38 --> 1486.2800000000002
oh it's Monday but come on

1482.78 --> 1486.28
I've been going for half an hour

1487.7 --> 1491.919
hello Mojo Gustavo

1502.52 --> 1507.1399999999999
I'm not getting a lot of feedback here

1505.039 --> 1510.1
guys

1507.14 --> 1510.1000000000001
statements

1513.559 --> 1518.299
left to move on to some other subject I

1516.08 --> 1519.6789999999999
mean this is just kind of what was on my

1518.299 --> 1524.3799999999999
mind

1519.679 --> 1524.38
some multiple videos that I've watched

1527.0 --> 1533.779
also yeah did anybody everybody catch my

1530.419 --> 1537.279
link that I rolled out like yesterday at

1533.779 --> 1537.279
the very very end of the show

1538.76 --> 1544.64
right Flynn General Flynn stay from

1542.48 --> 1549.1
their website from the guy

1544.64 --> 1549.1000000000001
basically saying nukes don't exist

1551.36 --> 1556.24
and then proceeding to talk about a

1553.4 --> 1556.24
whole bunch of other things

1556.82 --> 1560.1399999999999
did everybody catch that

1560.779 --> 1565.059
I'll link it up now again

1568.039 --> 1573.34
if I can find it

1570.32 --> 1573.34
yeah here it is

1576.32 --> 1578.98
looks like that's

1582.58 --> 1589.12
free if you want to take about this

1584.9 --> 1589.1200000000001
little bit yeah thanks Mojo

1590.87 --> 1593.9399999999998
[Music]

1596.03 --> 1599.68
[Music]

1600.44 --> 1602.98
foreign

1603.98 --> 1608.48
and it all does kind of like in a way

1606.62 --> 1609.86
make sense I mean how do you bring back

1608.48 --> 1612.38
slavery

1609.86 --> 1615.279
by dehumanizing people how do you

1612.38 --> 1615.279
dehumanize them

1616.46 --> 1622.52
well by Rolling Out culture that is

1619.94 --> 1624.8600000000001
dehumanizing and then everybody just

1622.52 --> 1627.86
thinks like oh everybody says it was

1624.86 --> 1630.1589999999999
slaught and trash and useless and

1627.86 --> 1633.08
sex history

1630.159 --> 1635.0590000000002
and then you when you think of everybody

1633.08 --> 1636.4399999999998
like trash because you're programmed

1635.059 --> 1637.8799999999999
like that because that's what you get to

1636.44 --> 1639.6200000000001
see and then you start to think about

1637.88 --> 1642.0800000000002
everybody like that

1639.62 --> 1644.7199999999998
well then it's a very easy Next Step

1642.08 --> 1647.24
from that vantage point to just say like

1644.72 --> 1649.46
you know what I think I'm better than

1647.24 --> 1652.22
all those people like everybody I think

1649.46 --> 1656.8400000000001
that they're just useless trash that

1652.22 --> 1659.179
should be killed and otherwise enslaved

1656.84 --> 1662.12
so in a way

1659.179 --> 1664.5800000000002
all the trash all the disgusting garbage

1662.12 --> 1666.7399999999998
that's been coming out through media and

1664.58 --> 1671.539
Hollywood and all that

1666.74 --> 1674.919
music industry and all that it's all

1671.539 --> 1678.919
part of a cultural revolution to

1674.919 --> 1678.919
reintroduce slavery

1679.279 --> 1685.22
but a slavery that's much worse than the

1682.82 --> 1688.24
original legal slavery

1685.22 --> 1688.24
much worse

1688.46 --> 1692.6000000000001
because it will not be legal it will be

1690.98 --> 1695.48
covert

1692.6 --> 1699.1999999999998
and will be based on power abuse

1695.48 --> 1701.419
to enable it to continue happening

1699.2 --> 1704.419
[Music]

1701.419 --> 1707.659
right so it's more a slavery of of abuse

1704.419 --> 1709.9
not a slavery of productivity which was

1707.659 --> 1713.2600000000002
the original slavery the legal form

1709.9 --> 1713.26
there too

1713.779 --> 1718.64
have workers

1715.94 --> 1721.94
have a yeah it's another system for

1718.64 --> 1723.5590000000002
workers the slavery from the past it

1721.94 --> 1726.14
really was that's what it is it was

1723.559 --> 1729.44
there for productivity yeah people

1726.14 --> 1731.779
didn't have slaves so they could torture

1729.44 --> 1733.5800000000002
them and [ __ ] and kill them for sports

1731.779 --> 1736.88
or something okay that's not the reason

1733.58 --> 1738.5
people had slaves that wasn't allowed it

1736.88 --> 1742.1000000000001
was illegal

1738.5 --> 1744.98
they had it for work

1742.1 --> 1747.62
well that sort of slavery is now no

1744.98 --> 1750.32
longer illegal it's not legal to do that

1747.62 --> 1752.6
so now they're reintroducing slavery on

1750.32 --> 1754.82
the spiritual level which there will be

1752.6 --> 1757.4599999999998
no legal framework it will simply be

1754.82 --> 1760.24
people abusing their power sticking

1757.46 --> 1764.1200000000001
together and imposing slavery

1760.24 --> 1767.48
involuntarily on a lot of people

1764.12 --> 1772.12
by basically categorizing them on the

1767.48 --> 1772.1200000000001
next layer which they then dehumanize

1772.159 --> 1779.96
slander

1775.12 --> 1781.1589999999999
and culturally socially what is peer

1779.96 --> 1784.48
pressure

1781.159 --> 1784.48
like try to

1788.36 --> 1793.8799999999999
teach people

1791.419 --> 1795.8600000000001
to peer pressure

1793.88 --> 1799.0390000000002
those groups

1795.86 --> 1801.1999999999998
to put them in their place and then then

1799.039 --> 1803.48
once that gets going

1801.2 --> 1806.8990000000001
then that entire category will be

1803.48 --> 1810.039
dehumanized and they will become

1806.899 --> 1810.039
more desperate

1811.58 --> 1815.84
and they're will broken and then you

1813.799 --> 1820.039
have your slavery then there that group

1815.84 --> 1821.48
is ruined they can really manifest as

1820.039 --> 1824.32
well

1821.48 --> 1827.059
so it's not even the slavery that is

1824.32 --> 1829.7
constructive it is a destructive form of

1827.059 --> 1832.1589999999999
slavery yeah the worst kind the

1829.7 --> 1835.1000000000001
nightmare kind

1832.159 --> 1837.0800000000002
all these people are doing even if you

1835.1 --> 1840.8799999999999
fall for that

1837.08 --> 1840.8799999999999
you deserve to be beaten up

1841.7 --> 1846.559
if you are like yeah

1844.279 --> 1849.74
no I'm going with these people I I'm too

1846.559 --> 1852.559
afraid I I want to a little dip in that

1849.74 --> 1854.779
power I'm okay

1852.559 --> 1856.94
with them treating people that don't

1854.779 --> 1858.32
deserve it like trash

1856.94 --> 1861.679
yeah

1858.32 --> 1863.84
that that that all comes with that

1861.679 --> 1865.52
and they it should be marked on your

1863.84 --> 1868.1589999999999
spirit

1865.52 --> 1870.74
rest of your life and you deserve to be

1868.159 --> 1873.1000000000001
beaten up at some point if you are doing

1870.74 --> 1873.1
that

1873.38 --> 1877.179
you deserve a very bad ending

1903.02 --> 1907.1589999999999
hey mystical rockhound fossils good to

1905.36 --> 1911.84
see you

1907.159 --> 1914.24
man wind is just blowing

1911.84 --> 1917.0
crazy

1914.24 --> 1919.1
like it's literally like sometimes just

1917.0 --> 1921.44
sucking the pressure out of the room I

1919.1 --> 1924.76
can literally feel like depressurizing

1921.44 --> 1924.76
happening because of the wind

1927.2 --> 1931.8400000000001
there's a lot of nice fresh air though

1932.899 --> 1937.9599999999998
the storm

1934.22 --> 1937.96
is kind of nice for the fresh air

1944.98 --> 1949.64
this typically by the way does normally

1947.36 --> 1951.74
happen in during April a lot there's

1949.64 --> 1954.3200000000002
always a lot of storms during April but

1951.74 --> 1958.6
now it seems to be happening

1954.32 --> 1958.6
well early March or halfway March

1961.1 --> 1966.98
so it almost feels like April's been

1964.12 --> 1970.039
displaced to March because we had snow

1966.98 --> 1971.84
it's very weird very very weird for

1970.039 --> 1974.779
March

1971.84 --> 1979.22
I mean February early yeah

1974.779 --> 1980.96
April Yeah March what no that's very

1979.22 --> 1983.6000000000001
rare

1980.96 --> 1987.7
and now this storm feels like April's

1983.6 --> 1989.899
been moved to March for some reason

1987.7 --> 1992.299
we'll see

1989.899 --> 1996.039
maybe that'll mean that in April there

1992.299 --> 1996.039
will be like a really early spring

2001.059 --> 2004.059
okay

2004.659 --> 2009.0
that's nice Dutch sayings

2011.019 --> 2015.36
I don't technically even know what that

2013.0 --> 2015.36
means

2017.679 --> 2021.3600000000001
March wagging his tail

2022.899 --> 2027.279
stirring its tail I don't I technically

2025.48 --> 2031.44
don't know what that actually stands for

2027.279 --> 2031.44
I've heard it but I don't understand it

2065.44 --> 2071.52
and watch rough weather

2068.919 --> 2071.52
hmm

2075.46 --> 2080.879
okay well if it's just a bit of rain I

2077.859 --> 2080.879
mean yeah

2081.7 --> 2086.379
seems logical

2084.58 --> 2088.359
and there has been rain so yeah that

2086.379 --> 2092.46
makes sense

2088.359 --> 2092.46
if that's what that stands for then sure

2092.74 --> 2095.6389999999997
Hey Taylor vision

2115.06 --> 2120.46
spring is ready to start

2117.82 --> 2123.76
well it does feel like it

2120.46 --> 2125.02
I feel like today today I feel kind of

2123.76 --> 2127.96
weird

2125.02 --> 2129.88
like I did not go to bed like extremely

2127.96 --> 2132.39
late or anything but it just feel like

2129.88 --> 2133.96
it it just won't wake up

2132.39 --> 2136.5989999999997
[Music]

2146.44 --> 2153.7000000000003
but I mean I'm like 70 awake

2151.06 --> 2156.72
it's just this part that just won't just

2153.7 --> 2156.72
like open up

2160.44 --> 2163.53
[Music]

2164.94 --> 2169.26
hello Richard G good to see you

2169.53 --> 2172.639
[Music]

2176.32 --> 2181.3590000000004
man I got no feedback whatsoever on

2179.079 --> 2183.52
yesterday's show which is weird because

2181.359 --> 2186.359
usually there's some kind of stupid

2183.52 --> 2186.359
troll come in

2188.619 --> 2192.359
and then I end up deleting it

2193.9 --> 2197.64
oh wait there's some comments now

2199.48 --> 2203.339
just stupid [ __ ]

2205.9 --> 2208.44
I mean

2208.48 --> 2213.52
I I shouldn't do it but I just wanna I'm

2212.32 --> 2216.119
so

2213.52 --> 2218.92
like

2216.119 --> 2222.48
surprised about some of these comments

2218.92 --> 2222.48
just like really

2226.0 --> 2229.02
let's just look at this

2229.66 --> 2235.2999999999997
seen you lose your mental control lately

2233.22 --> 2239.4399999999996
no lies

2235.3 --> 2243.7000000000003
you have been unstable and lost

2239.44 --> 2246.52
you have lost your support others

2243.7 --> 2249.359
how can you still follow those who

2246.52 --> 2249.359
mislead you

2250.119 --> 2258.94
what the [ __ ] is he blabbering about

2255.099 --> 2261.1600000000003
some barely English speaking deranged

2258.94 --> 2263.02
globetard

2261.16 --> 2267.2999999999997
and what is he talking about lost

2263.02 --> 2267.3
supporters I have more supporters

2267.52 --> 2273.7599999999998
I have more subscribers I've passed the

2270.48 --> 2276.78
2.7 k Mark

2273.76 --> 2276.78
for a while

2278.14 --> 2283.5989999999997
and I have actually been getting by yeah

2280.42 --> 2287.7400000000002
sometimes I get a little loud

2283.599 --> 2290.38
because it's like I need support now but

2287.74 --> 2293.8799999999997
just

2290.38 --> 2293.88
that's the comments now

2299.079 --> 2301.619
really

2324.22 --> 2330.5989999999997
yeah just look at it see

2326.68 --> 2330.5989999999997
there's actually somebody saying that

2338.5 --> 2343.2
sometimes I think like

2341.02 --> 2345.7599999999998
if I'm gonna say some of these things

2343.2 --> 2346.48
then people are gonna believe I made it

2345.76 --> 2349.1800000000003
up

2346.48 --> 2351.3
because it just sounds so ridiculous to

2349.18 --> 2351.2999999999997
me

2351.82 --> 2357.9
but yeah this

2353.8 --> 2357.9
people actually comment with that

2358.85 --> 2363.979
[Music]

2373.06 --> 2377.32
okay Thor Casey really you're okay with

2376.18 --> 2378.5789999999997
that

2377.32 --> 2380.8590000000004
but

2378.579 --> 2382.54
what if they're then going to like get

2380.859 --> 2384.5789999999997
really sick and need all these

2382.54 --> 2386.079
operations and they don't have money for

2384.579 --> 2387.46
that and then the government's gonna pay

2386.079 --> 2391.38
for that and get that out of your

2387.46 --> 2391.38
paycheck are you still okay with it then

2400.72 --> 2406.4399999999996
yeah because I'm not okay with people

2403.24 --> 2406.4399999999996
[ __ ] themselves up

2406.78 --> 2411.579
you know why

2408.46 --> 2414.4
not not because I'm such a principled

2411.579 --> 2417.04
man no it's because I know pragmatically

2414.4 --> 2420.78
that I'll be the one and others that

2417.04 --> 2420.7799999999997
will have to indirectly pay for that

2422.32 --> 2429.78
yeah so it's like oh oh oh you think you

2425.74 --> 2433.359
can do that do you well we take offense

2429.78 --> 2437.02
you doing that is literally you in an

2433.359 --> 2438.46
indirect way rubbing us

2437.02 --> 2440.5
yeah

2438.46 --> 2443.76
you're robbing yourself and then we're

2440.5 --> 2443.76
forced to pay for that

2446.68 --> 2449.46
that sucks

2473.2 --> 2478.72
I but I mean

2475.54 --> 2480.64
yeah who am I to get involved with that

2478.72 --> 2484.24
but I mean if somebody's like literally

2480.64 --> 2487.2999999999997
like measurably provably

2484.24 --> 2490.0
doing some kind of terrible drug in a

2487.3 --> 2492.76
way that's like really damaging or

2490.0 --> 2495.76
overeating and just refuse to stop I

2492.76 --> 2497.98
mean those people should be

2495.76 --> 2501.0400000000004
like

2497.98 --> 2502.66
not just oh well just let them do we

2501.04 --> 2503.74
can't stop them no they should be like

2502.66 --> 2506.3199999999997
hey

2503.74 --> 2508.4199999999996
we're noticing this Behavior

2506.32 --> 2510.04
right this is where it's gonna lead

2508.42 --> 2511.599
that's provable

2510.04 --> 2514.18
and

2511.599 --> 2516.76
like we're giving you a heads up now

2514.18 --> 2519.64
because like we're giving you a warning

2516.76 --> 2521.6800000000003
and that means like if you don't stop

2519.64 --> 2524.14
We're not gonna pay for what you're

2521.68 --> 2525.5789999999997
gonna end up with so if you don't if

2524.14 --> 2528.2799999999997
you're not rich you don't have half a

2525.579 --> 2531.52
million for operations in the bank

2528.28 --> 2534.099
I best stop stop this nonsense

2531.52 --> 2537.3
because that means you are literally

2534.099 --> 2537.3
going to die then

2539.32 --> 2542.04
how about that

2544.96 --> 2549.52
it's like oh oh

2547.0 --> 2551.8
but I'm a compulsive eater okay well

2549.52 --> 2553.72
then you're going to die

2551.8 --> 2557.1600000000003
because we're not gonna pay for the

2553.72 --> 2557.16
operations nobody is

2573.4 --> 2579.04
right

2575.8 --> 2581.44
so better learn to feel hungry and

2579.04 --> 2584.079
miserable and deal with that and just

2581.44 --> 2586.66
sit in it and just feel it

2584.079 --> 2590.02
let it all go

2586.66 --> 2591.819
because otherwise you're just gonna seem

2590.02 --> 2596.46
like you feel a little blessed for a

2591.819 --> 2596.46
while till you get really sick and die

2597.339 --> 2603.94
anyway go for me fly pose

2601.48 --> 2606.7
right well hey if they really need yeah

2603.94 --> 2609.52
but I mean the problem is lipo is

2606.7 --> 2611.98
completely [ __ ] useless if you just

2609.52 --> 2613.18
keep eating

2611.98 --> 2616.0
yeah

2613.18 --> 2617.9199999999996
the problem is with Overeaters is that

2616.0 --> 2621.96
they overeat that's the real problem

2617.92 --> 2621.96
once they can actually stop that

2622.48 --> 2628.48
then yeah trying to shrink them down to

2625.9 --> 2631.06
sort of like a normal sized human being

2628.48 --> 2633.28
that's like cosmetic but that's that

2631.06 --> 2635.56
they have to have fixed it like there's

2633.28 --> 2639.7000000000003
no point in if they just keep eating to

2635.56 --> 2639.7
oh we need emergency liposuction

2640.66 --> 2645.3999999999996
doesn't that doesn't help them

2643.96 --> 2648.64
doesn't work

2645.4 --> 2650.44
still gonna get worse

2648.64 --> 2653.3799999999997
because it's like operations like that

2650.44 --> 2655.56
are also just damaging for your body as

2653.38 --> 2655.56
well

2659.98 --> 2664.3
gastric and whatever

2665.619 --> 2672.76
if yeah I mean that is a thing

2669.94 --> 2676.359
right but the real problem is that the

2672.76 --> 2679.92
the person themselves is just

2676.359 --> 2679.92
too compulsive

2681.819 --> 2688.9
like the compulsion is the problem and

2685.06 --> 2691.599
it needs to be tackled and that might be

2688.9 --> 2693.64
the most miserable or the toughest

2691.599 --> 2696.94
[ __ ] thing that that person could

2693.64 --> 2701.0989999999997
ever learn to do in their life but they

2696.94 --> 2701.099
have to [ __ ] do it

2701.2 --> 2704.16
or die

2720.819 --> 2725.2599999999998
what the [ __ ]

2722.619 --> 2727.42
why flat the holics

2725.26 --> 2729.599
what kind of ridiculous statement is

2727.42 --> 2729.599
that

2733.06 --> 2738.5789999999997
should not get welfare because you're a

2735.22 --> 2742.319
smoker are you [ __ ] with me why the

2738.579 --> 2742.319
[ __ ] based on what

2744.339 --> 2748.319
based on [ __ ] what dude

2751.24 --> 2756.64
oh no I shouldn't get medical support

2753.819 --> 2758.56
okay fine

2756.64 --> 2759.8799999999997
what the hell does that have to do with

2758.56 --> 2763.5
welfare

2759.88 --> 2763.5
but you're not allowed to smoke

2763.68 --> 2768.18
where did you come up with that [ __ ]

2769.72 --> 2778.74
yeah I don't even use the medical system

2773.56 --> 2778.74
at all like at all

2795.579 --> 2802.119
that flat to horses just being a freak

2799.839 --> 2805.42
or maybe it just feels really angry

2802.119 --> 2807.52
because he is actually super fat he has

2805.42 --> 2810.64
a problem compulsively eating and he

2807.52 --> 2813.099
didn't like what I said

2810.64 --> 2814.96
so he's like oh yo you're a smoker right

2813.099 --> 2817.7400000000002
maybe we'll do that with smoking oh yeah

2814.96 --> 2817.7400000000002
based on what

2825.28 --> 2830.619
what you think that if I ever at some

2827.74 --> 2833.319
point if I if if because it's no

2830.619 --> 2836.56
guarantee yeah Medicals how this all

2833.319 --> 2838.119
works yeah it's different

2836.56 --> 2841.66
there's no guarantee that I'm gonna get

2838.119 --> 2843.88
lung cancer but you think that

2841.66 --> 2845.92
I'm gonna go through like the entire

2843.88 --> 2848.44
cancer procedure with all that

2845.92 --> 2850.96
mainstream garbage with the poison and

2848.44 --> 2852.76
the radiation which is also expensive

2850.96 --> 2856.119
right that's all those medical you think

2852.76 --> 2857.5600000000004
that I would [ __ ] even voluntarily go

2856.119 --> 2861.1600000000003
through that

2857.56 --> 2865.2599999999998
are you out of your [ __ ] mind

2861.16 --> 2865.2599999999998
I'd rather just die

2866.56 --> 2871.66
then help manifest that piece of [ __ ]

2870.099 --> 2874.3700000000003
system out there

2871.66 --> 2877.46
I'd rather just die

2874.37 --> 2877.46
[Music]

2880.359 --> 2886.06
yeah and I like to take very good care

2882.819 --> 2887.2599999999998
of my own health including being a

2886.06 --> 2889.48
smoker

2887.26 --> 2891.6400000000003
it's not like oh well the smoking is the

2889.48 --> 2894.28
the thing that is the exception no no

2891.64 --> 2895.839
I'm very careful with how I smoke that I

2894.28 --> 2900.1600000000003
don't smoke too much

2895.839 --> 2904.599
I got proper filters to make it less

2900.16 --> 2904.5989999999997
detrimental to my system yeah

2912.04 --> 2917.74
right and it like even that entire

2915.04 --> 2921.46
statement like I didn't say oh wow

2917.74 --> 2924.04
you're super obese so we're gonna cut

2921.46 --> 2927.18
your social welfare like I didn't say

2924.04 --> 2927.18
that what the [ __ ]

2944.74 --> 2950.64
yeah Richard G I know

2948.16 --> 2950.64
foreign

2960.77 --> 2964.409
[Music]

2972.9 --> 2978.839
Casey but yeah there's a massive amount

2976.06 --> 2978.839
of Taxation

2982.599 --> 2986.94
there's a massive amount of Taxation on

2984.46 --> 2986.94
Tobacco

2987.04 --> 2991.42
that that's also there

2989.859 --> 2994.42
but

2991.42 --> 2997.5
the point is is like that's nobody's

2994.42 --> 2997.5
freaking business dude

2998.2 --> 3004.02
but hey yeah if you're like oh I have to

3001.02 --> 3006.359
smoke 24 7. like I can never stop

3004.02 --> 3010.2
lighting a cigarette yeah then you're

3006.359 --> 3013.0789999999997
gonna like measurably [ __ ] yourself up

3010.2 --> 3015.48
and that should have

3013.079 --> 3017.88
like a similar response I mean if you're

3015.48 --> 3021.2
literally just doing something that is

3017.88 --> 3021.2000000000003
probably gonna kill you

3021.96 --> 3026.52
then yeah

3024.06 --> 3028.0789999999997
the same should happen but yeah I'm not

3026.52 --> 3030.359
doing that though yeah I'm not a chain

3028.079 --> 3032.88
smoker

3030.359 --> 3036.319
and I use filters I don't even smoke

3032.88 --> 3036.319
tobacco as is

3036.839 --> 3040.74
really

3038.22 --> 3042.8999999999996
sometimes I do especially when I run out

3040.74 --> 3045.4799999999996
of cannabis

3042.9 --> 3046.98
but even then I use filters very

3045.48 --> 3050.52
carefully it

3046.98 --> 3054.44
it's just that's not going to lead

3050.52 --> 3054.44
to guaranteed lung cancer

3070.44 --> 3075.839
tobacco and nootropica brains that yeah

3072.839 --> 3078.859
it is effectively

3075.839 --> 3078.859
it's the nicotine

3086.64 --> 3090.2999999999997
I mean

3088.22 --> 3094.3799999999997
tobacco is

3090.3 --> 3095.819
yeah there's all kinds of properties so

3094.38 --> 3097.559
right

3095.819 --> 3099.96
but arguably

3097.559 --> 3101.6400000000003
this that they say oh look at all these

3099.96 --> 3105.0
chemicals that are released when you

3101.64 --> 3109.0789999999997
burn it like oh yeah okay now

3105.0 --> 3113.88
that that's there sure but now compare

3109.079 --> 3115.44
that to the actually yeah the the Sauced

3113.88 --> 3118.079
tobacco

3115.44 --> 3121.02
like typical cigarette brands and what

3118.079 --> 3125.4
they put in that now compare it like

3121.02 --> 3129.96
actual raw tobacco leaf untreated

3125.4 --> 3131.579
from a tobacco farm right and the smoke

3129.96 --> 3134.2200000000003
that comes from that little toxins in

3131.579 --> 3138.059
there now compare that to regular brand

3134.22 --> 3140.3999999999996
cigarettes and let's see the percentages

3138.059 --> 3143.3390000000004
of toxins in that okay I'll guarantee

3140.4 --> 3146.099
you the raw tobacco leaf is going to be

3143.339 --> 3149.0
way less

3146.099 --> 3149.0
it's gonna be less

3153.96 --> 3157.92
we're smoking tobacco right now yeah

3155.7 --> 3160.74
okay cool

3157.92 --> 3162.7200000000003
try to get organic right well the best

3160.74 --> 3164.5789999999997
way is to just get the leaves themselves

3162.72 --> 3166.74
directly from the grower I kind of want

3164.579 --> 3169.02
to do that again I I did that a few

3166.74 --> 3171.4199999999996
years ago was very nice to have that

3169.02 --> 3174.359
very nice

3171.42 --> 3176.839
but it'll require like a slight

3174.359 --> 3176.839
investment

3176.88 --> 3181.619
it's like what is it 120 bucks or

3179.76 --> 3184.7000000000003
something and then I'll have like a

3181.619 --> 3184.7000000000003
supply for quite a while

3185.819 --> 3190.98
can

3187.079 --> 3193.8590000000004
up I what

3190.98 --> 3195.839
yeah yeah you can buy cannabis in the

3193.859 --> 3197.52
Netherlands

3195.839 --> 3200.94
although it's not

3197.52 --> 3202.619
it's not retail legal it's and it's

3200.94 --> 3205.079
condoned under very specific

3202.619 --> 3207.1800000000003
circumstances you have to have a coffee

3205.079 --> 3209.88
shop license

3207.18 --> 3212.04
it's a very tough to get

3209.88 --> 3216.319
and to keep

3212.04 --> 3216.319
you need that to be able to sell it

3240.15 --> 3243.9
[Music]

3241.44 --> 3246.38
yeah I don't know what the hell you're

3243.9 --> 3246.38
talking about

3248.28 --> 3252.38
Thor Casey but no

3254.94 --> 3258.8
it's not nearly identical

3259.14 --> 3265.14
regular cigarette brands put [ __ ] in

3262.5 --> 3267.839
their tobacco and the filters themselves

3265.14 --> 3269.16
that they use also have a detrimental

3267.839 --> 3272.4
effect

3269.16 --> 3275.7799999999997
yeah regular cigarette filters not good

3272.4 --> 3275.78
not good at all

3283.14 --> 3286.14
bro

3313.8 --> 3317.3
hello evil nightmare

3317.4 --> 3324.079
oh no look at all those people oh no

3321.0 --> 3326.339
everybody's go away

3324.079 --> 3330.48
oh no

3326.339 --> 3333.5
Have I Lost support others oh yes that's

3330.48 --> 3333.5
why there's like

3333.78 --> 3338.579
10 people yapping in my chat

3336.839 --> 3341.819
30 watching

3338.579 --> 3344.2200000000003
I've lost so many followers oh no yeah

3341.819 --> 3346.5589999999997
it's not true by the way I have heard

3344.22 --> 3348.02
that there is like a weird

3346.559 --> 3351.3590000000004
uh

3348.02 --> 3354.059
bot reset happening on YouTube and other

3351.359 --> 3355.92
on the entire internet the own Benjamin

3354.059 --> 3357.1800000000003
brought this forth actually in his last

3355.92 --> 3359.7000000000003
show

3357.18 --> 3362.2799999999997
that

3359.7 --> 3364.68
a lot of YouTube is crashing

3362.28 --> 3366.5400000000004
but I know why

3364.68 --> 3373.68
it's because

3366.54 --> 3377.24
so much of following is fake is Bots

3373.68 --> 3380.8799999999997
right there is like

3377.24 --> 3383.16
millions of YouTubers Millions out there

3380.88 --> 3385.319
they're all compartmentalized they don't

3383.16 --> 3387.66
really get in contact with one another

3385.319 --> 3391.2
and a lot of them have

3387.66 --> 3393.48
basically paid to get following and a

3391.2 --> 3396.1189999999997
lot of people have been doing that

3393.48 --> 3399.78
so the amount of actual numbers of

3396.119 --> 3401.76
people watching on YouTube has been

3399.78 --> 3403.2200000000003
yeah

3401.76 --> 3406.92
it's been

3403.22 --> 3409.14
distorted because of Bot activity that

3406.92 --> 3411.0
has been very standard it's like oh

3409.14 --> 3413.64
biggest YouTube channel ever well okay

3411.0 --> 3416.18
I'll guarantee you that like 95 of that

3413.64 --> 3418.5589999999997
is actually Bots

3416.18 --> 3421.14
I guarantee

3418.559 --> 3424.28
that that's real that that's actually

3421.14 --> 3424.2799999999997
what's happening

3426.48 --> 3431.04
I don't know if it's exactly like 95 but

3428.76 --> 3435.48
it is like a big chunk

3431.04 --> 3438.18
when you have massive amounts of viewers

3435.48 --> 3440.819
it's probably a lot of bots

3438.18 --> 3441.839
that are just there to crack up the

3440.819 --> 3444.96
numbers

3441.839 --> 3448.2599999999998
that's part of the game

3444.96 --> 3451.2
and it seems like there has been reset I

3448.26 --> 3453.5400000000004
mean they do take them away again

3451.2 --> 3454.7599999999998
just like whoop they're all erased all

3453.54 --> 3459.839
this just

3454.76 --> 3463.1400000000003
and simulation of people following oh we

3459.839 --> 3465.359
have to erase it now because it's like

3463.14 --> 3467.94
getting out of balance

3465.359 --> 3471.319
so they do a great reset on all these

3467.94 --> 3471.319
fake YouTube Bots

3474.839 --> 3478.68
and that's why I've heard that a lot of

3476.819 --> 3480.599
YouTube channels apparently have gone

3478.68 --> 3482.7
down pretty dramatically in the amounts

3480.599 --> 3486.119
of subscribers out there

3482.7 --> 3488.2799999999997
well not me I'm steadily growing

3486.119 --> 3490.6400000000003
like pretty much the same as a few years

3488.28 --> 3490.6400000000003
ago

3500.28 --> 3505.3190000000004
you see bots having conversations and

3502.2 --> 3506.8799999999997
comments all the time yeah

3505.319 --> 3508.98
they just go

3506.88 --> 3510.359
just like oh one comment or you leave it

3508.98 --> 3512.04
there then blah blah blah blah blah blah

3510.359 --> 3514.859
blah blah before you know there's like

3512.04 --> 3519.48
30 comments in there and it's absolutely

3514.859 --> 3522.42
about nothing just whining just whining

3519.48 --> 3525.0
I mean that's automated man

3522.42 --> 3527.099
or that's people that are just really

3525.0 --> 3530.52
[ __ ] insane I mean I cannot believe

3527.099 --> 3534.1800000000003
that people would actually do that

3530.52 --> 3537.319
like spend an hour filling up negative

3534.18 --> 3540.5989999999997
comments in some

3537.319 --> 3543.299
very remote YouTube channel there's

3540.599 --> 3545.94
nobody's ever heard of really or people

3543.299 --> 3548.46
tend to avoid like I it makes no sense

3545.94 --> 3549.299
there's just a natural activity out

3548.46 --> 3552.9
there

3549.299 --> 3554.16
and it seems like there's been a bit of

3552.9 --> 3557.7000000000003
a reset

3554.16 --> 3559.3799999999997
and a lot of it is getting removed

3557.7 --> 3562.2
which is good

3559.38 --> 3564.96
because it's all fake garbage I don't

3562.2 --> 3566.8799999999997
want fake following I don't want fake

3564.96 --> 3569.76
people hanging around to make everybody

3566.88 --> 3572.28
feel like oh really popular look at all

3569.76 --> 3574.92
that bickering and chatting there

3572.28 --> 3578.099
all these non-individuals that you'd

3574.92 --> 3580.02
never actually talk to because they have

3578.099 --> 3582.119
nothing interesting to say so there's

3580.02 --> 3583.859
nothing about them that will be like hey

3582.119 --> 3585.6600000000003
who are you I would like to get to know

3583.859 --> 3589.94
you better oh wait you're not a real

3585.66 --> 3589.94
person what oh yeah yeah

3597.78 --> 3602.6400000000003
do you think any of your live chat books

3600.599 --> 3604.6800000000003
are actually Bots

3602.64 --> 3607.44
no

3604.68 --> 3609.839
they're socks though

3607.44 --> 3612.839
they're just they have some people that

3609.839 --> 3615.18
are sort of stalkers a lot of anti-flat

3612.839 --> 3617.299
earthers are kind of stalkerish

3615.18 --> 3617.299
thank you

3620.64 --> 3625.68
and I have had some Bots

3623.819 --> 3628.38
but

3625.68 --> 3631.68
I can immediately feel that I've had

3628.38 --> 3634.619
them like what is it up too much pretty

3631.68 --> 3636.8999999999996
much like a year or two ago then it kind

3634.619 --> 3638.52
of stopped but before that time there

3636.9 --> 3641.46
was a lot of it

3638.52 --> 3643.2
and it was very detectable because they

3641.46 --> 3644.339
would have like Cookie Cutter ways of

3643.2 --> 3646.6189999999997
doing things

3644.339 --> 3649.02
it's like uh you're a bot and it just

3646.619 --> 3653.359
immediately kicked them out

3649.02 --> 3653.359
somebody got really triggered over that

3654.72 --> 3661.339
because I would get like really [ __ ]

3657.599 --> 3661.339
angry trolls when I did that

3665.099 --> 3668.46
so

3666.24 --> 3671.7
I think there's just some really [ __ ]

3668.46 --> 3673.44
up crazy obsessing people out there

3671.7 --> 3676.859
that

3673.44 --> 3678.54
this opportunity to [ __ ] around with the

3676.859 --> 3682.319
statistics by

3678.54 --> 3684.299
just there it's being done and nobody's

3682.319 --> 3688.579
really stopping them by basically

3684.299 --> 3688.579
creating fake Bots and [ __ ] and

3688.68 --> 3692.2799999999997
and YouTube's apparently just fine with

3690.96 --> 3695.2200000000003
that

3692.28 --> 3696.78
until they basically like just erase

3695.22 --> 3698.819
everything

3696.78 --> 3700.559
and just reset it

3698.819 --> 3703.38
I think that's roughly how it works

3700.559 --> 3705.9
might be incorrect though

3703.38 --> 3709.52
but I mean most people that come in my

3705.9 --> 3709.52
chat now are actually people

3711.24 --> 3716.22
I haven't really spotted any Bots yet I

3714.059 --> 3719.0400000000004
mean sometimes I think like oh this is a

3716.22 --> 3720.48
bot but then I'm realizing it could also

3719.04 --> 3722.579
just be

3720.48 --> 3724.619
like a foreigner that's not really good

3722.579 --> 3728.119
at English or something

3724.619 --> 3728.119
but they're still a gamma

3729.059 --> 3734.099
but like typical bot activity I haven't

3732.599 --> 3736.38
seen it in a long time dude I haven't

3734.099 --> 3739.2000000000003
seen spamming

3736.38 --> 3741.299
like actual typical spamming in a long

3739.2 --> 3743.2799999999997
time

3741.299 --> 3747.059
I saw it like for the first time again

3743.28 --> 3749.579
was it on the Friday show wait no it was

3747.059 --> 3752.3390000000004
during ball buster somebody in the chat

3749.579 --> 3755.2400000000002
during ball Buster's life was spamming

3752.339 --> 3756.859
all of a sudden I I was like what

3755.24 --> 3760.02
spam

3756.859 --> 3762.24
wow that's been a while because I

3760.02 --> 3766.319
haven't really seen that that sort of

3762.24 --> 3766.319
spamming since like 2018.

3767.46 --> 3772.5
it's just completely stopped

3769.98 --> 3774.299
like everywhere it stopped

3772.5 --> 3775.68
I don't see that anymore that used to be

3774.299 --> 3779.4
like a typical thing that will

3775.68 --> 3781.74
continually happen since 2014.

3779.4 --> 3783.7200000000003
since I really got more involved with

3781.74 --> 3787.319
the internet and YouTube

3783.72 --> 3788.8799999999997
but it's really stopped spam stops it's

3787.319 --> 3791.48
not there anymore it doesn't really

3788.88 --> 3791.48
happen anymore

3795.42 --> 3798.98
hey LSG good to see you

3803.42 --> 3808.92
likelihood that at least one viewer is a

3806.46 --> 3810.359
government agent is 100 yeah

3808.92 --> 3813.66
I'm sure

3810.359 --> 3816.54
absolutely I I'm I'm pretty damn sure

3813.66 --> 3820.44
that there's people here from my city

3816.54 --> 3823.74
even from the government here that are

3820.44 --> 3826.619
keeping tabs of what I do

3823.74 --> 3828.9599999999996
and in a way I want them to because I

3826.619 --> 3832.28
have communications for them too I have

3828.96 --> 3832.28
communications for everybody

3832.98 --> 3837.38
information for everybody

3835.079 --> 3837.38
foreign

3839.24 --> 3846.02
people to keep track of what I do

3842.359 --> 3846.02
including analysts

3851.819 --> 3857.16
and I mean I certainly justified by

3854.46 --> 3860.88
sometimes going all revolutionary and

3857.16 --> 3863.8799999999997
angry and basically threatening

3860.88 --> 3863.88
non-specific

3864.119 --> 3867.2400000000002
yeah

3865.22 --> 3869.9399999999996
non-specifically threatening with

3867.24 --> 3872.66
violence so yeah I mean yeah you better

3869.94 --> 3875.52
well [ __ ] keep tabs on me you hear

3872.66 --> 3877.2
you better analyze the [ __ ] out of what

3875.52 --> 3880.38
I'm saying

3877.2 --> 3882.74
you better damn well do that get on to

3880.38 --> 3882.7400000000002
it already

3887.42 --> 3891.839
do you think my roommate's in the

3889.92 --> 3895.02
landlord

3891.839 --> 3899.359
that's hysterical steamy Traveler

3895.02 --> 3899.359
no absolutely not

3900.119 --> 3904.7400000000002
no they wouldn't know what to do with it

3902.76 --> 3907.5
I mean

3904.74 --> 3910.74
some of the girl like

3907.5 --> 3912.42
maybe like they some of them might have

3910.74 --> 3914.5789999999997
checked out a show

3912.42 --> 3915.78
I think probably

3914.579 --> 3918.78
like

3915.78 --> 3920.88
a guy roommate has probably checked out

3918.78 --> 3923.46
a show of mine at some point

3920.88 --> 3926.04
and my landlord certainly has but that's

3923.46 --> 3928.819
years ago he actually got really freaked

3926.04 --> 3928.819
out by it

3929.22 --> 3933.299
he checked like a couple of shows but

3931.5 --> 3936.96
that wasn't like in a real Ray twin

3933.299 --> 3938.579
period so that wasn't very helpful

3936.96 --> 3940.88
you actually thought I was completely

3938.579 --> 3940.88
crazy

3941.4 --> 3948.5
literally and that's all [ __ ] broke out

3944.04 --> 3948.5
but I mean no

3950.7 --> 3957.14
I don't know anybody in person that

3953.46 --> 3957.14
actually watches my shows

3963.119 --> 3966.079
you guys do

3987.24 --> 3991.22
yeah third KC I'm sure it is

3994.22 --> 3999.5389999999998
but I mean yeah if it's gonna mark key

3997.38 --> 4002.1800000000003
words and

3999.539 --> 4003.5
then there will be a person still

4002.18 --> 4005.299
looking at it

4003.5 --> 4008.0
you see

4005.299 --> 4010.88
but the Bots

4008.0 --> 4013.88
do digging but they don't really make

4010.88 --> 4016.1600000000003
the decisions so they just Mark things

4013.88 --> 4018.6800000000003
and it's like oh there are certain Flags

4016.16 --> 4019.7599999999998
then an agent will actually like take a

4018.68 --> 4020.77
look at it

4019.76 --> 4024.059
hmm

4020.77 --> 4024.059
[Music]

4028.88 --> 4033.039
what are you talking about dark AC

4033.25 --> 4036.46
[Music]

4036.5 --> 4040.0
that's not correct English

4054.5 --> 4061.099
haven't I met some what

4057.14 --> 4064.48
at conventions agents

4061.099 --> 4064.48
not that I know of

4070.28 --> 4075.3190000000004
but I mean I literally don't care I mean

4072.559 --> 4078.38
sure dude infiltrate me

4075.319 --> 4081.02
infiltrate me whatever

4078.38 --> 4084.1600000000003
it's all good like

4081.02 --> 4084.16
I'm not afraid

4085.099 --> 4088.4
there's there's literally nothing for me

4087.14 --> 4090.44
to hide

4088.4 --> 4092.5
because as soon as I would have

4090.44 --> 4095.539
something to hide yeah well guess what

4092.5 --> 4098.239
I'm not just gonna like oh oh I'm just

4095.539 --> 4099.859
gonna trust all us people then oh

4098.239 --> 4101.718999999999
they're gonna pull them with me yeah

4099.859 --> 4103.58
yeah that's where the agents are I'm not

4101.719 --> 4105.319
a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah if I'm gonna do

4103.58 --> 4109.219
something [ __ ] Criminal

4105.319 --> 4112.6990000000005
you think I'll allow you the opportunity

4109.219 --> 4114.679
to catch me I'm not some freaking [ __ ]

4112.699 --> 4117.08
criminal okay

4114.679 --> 4119.779
I'm not a criminal at all if I would be

4117.08 --> 4123.699
you'd never [ __ ] find out that's the

4119.779 --> 4123.6990000000005
point huh dumbass

4126.64 --> 4131.54
but by all means hang around

4129.44 --> 4133.94
maybe I'll figure out you are an agent

4131.54 --> 4137.239
so I can actually like hey agent dude

4133.94 --> 4139.759
see that could you make a report of that

4137.239 --> 4141.199
that would be great yeah I'd love to

4139.759 --> 4143.42
have an agent around that I could

4141.199 --> 4145.48
literally address like hey dude see that

4143.42 --> 4149.66
could you could you mark that up please

4145.48 --> 4152.599999999999
that will be awesome I want agents I

4149.66 --> 4155.179
want agents around me

4152.6 --> 4157.1
get over here

4155.179 --> 4161.4400000000005
yeah

4157.1 --> 4161.4400000000005
there's stuff I'd like you to see

4170.179 --> 4174.679
do the people around me know that I'm a

4172.58 --> 4177.38
flat earther yeah

4174.679 --> 4180.6990000000005
everybody in the house does

4177.38 --> 4180.6990000000005
my landlord does

4181.52 --> 4185.02
not that he gives a [ __ ]

4194.36 --> 4197.96
yeah but there's absolutely no point in

4196.34 --> 4200.0
keeping it a secret

4197.96 --> 4201.56
and it's not really doable anyway

4200.0 --> 4203.78
because what am I gonna do is like hey

4201.56 --> 4205.52
what do you do yeah I'm a YouTuber oh

4203.78 --> 4207.679
what about

4205.52 --> 4209.96
well I don't say Flat Earth straight out

4207.679 --> 4213.76
but I do say like yeah well I'm into

4209.96 --> 4217.76
physics and history

4213.76 --> 4217.76
and psychology

4217.96 --> 4221.9
learning to Spirit mechanics and then

4220.4 --> 4223.5199999999995
explain a little bit about what I mean

4221.9 --> 4226.5199999999995
with that

4223.52 --> 4228.92
Colton right

4226.52 --> 4232.280000000001
and into Christ

4228.92 --> 4235.76
also always put that one next because it

4232.28 --> 4237.98
is true and then if they like oh that's

4235.76 --> 4240.8
a new physics really and then like yeah

4237.98 --> 4242.9
yeah you'd be surprised

4240.8 --> 4243.5
something really weird with physics you

4242.9 --> 4246.92
know

4243.5 --> 4249.199
and then if I size them up it's like oh

4246.92 --> 4251.2390000000005
yeah they could probably not have an

4249.199 --> 4253.339999999999
allergic reaction then I tell her yeah

4251.239 --> 4256.839999999999
yeah because the Earth is actually flat

4253.34 --> 4256.84
and that's what I talk about and

4257.6 --> 4262.400000000001
I haven't had any negative responses to

4260.06 --> 4265.280000000001
to

4262.4 --> 4267.46
yeah to informing anybody about it like

4265.28 --> 4267.46
that

4282.86 --> 4288.139999999999
do you believe yeah no I'm sure that you

4286.04 --> 4290.659
will get funny faces like that because

4288.14 --> 4293.62
you like to hang around with people

4290.659 --> 4293.62
that are dumb

4294.679 --> 4300.26
evil nightmare I know you do

4298.04 --> 4302.36
that's what Ballers do they like to hang

4300.26 --> 4304.46
around with dumb people

4302.36 --> 4306.44
because it makes them feel Superior for

4304.46 --> 4308.84
thinking that they know everything about

4306.44 --> 4310.65
the world when they know absolutely the

4308.84 --> 4313.76
reverse of that

4310.65 --> 4313.759999999999
[Music]

4316.1 --> 4322.58
yeah I've never had that question be

4319.76 --> 4326.679
asked to me not once

4322.58 --> 4326.679
do you believe two of his blood

4328.34 --> 4334.6990000000005
and I don't say I debate Flat Earth I

4331.46 --> 4337.34
explain the Earth is flat

4334.699 --> 4339.86
here's why

4337.34 --> 4341.659000000001
and then I summarize it as if I would

4339.86 --> 4344.599999999999
have to explain it to somebody for the

4341.659 --> 4346.339999999999
very first time without them having any

4344.6 --> 4349.1
kind of background

4346.34 --> 4351.679
of mechanics physics or anything I'll

4349.1 --> 4354.02
just explain it to them

4351.679 --> 4356.659
like I would explain a kit for the first

4354.02 --> 4359.540000000001
time yeah guess what they're not gonna

4356.659 --> 4362.78
ask me do you believe the Earth is flat

4359.54 --> 4365.78
after that no they're gonna be like

4362.78 --> 4365.78
what

4367.82 --> 4372.139999999999
yeah that's what that that's what

4369.92 --> 4374.179
happens

4372.14 --> 4378.08
because I don't debate the Flat Earth

4374.179 --> 4380.42
the Earth is flat and it's very provable

4378.08 --> 4383.179
very very proven well the proof is

4380.42 --> 4387.02
everywhere everywhere yeah not

4383.179 --> 4389.2390000000005
scientific proof geometric proof natural

4387.02 --> 4394.900000000001
law proof

4389.239 --> 4394.9
basic logical reasoning proof

4396.199 --> 4401.419999999999
and now we all like to forget that or

4398.179 --> 4403.52
the endlessly bicker and whine and try

4401.42 --> 4406.82
to pull it out of me like oh whoa whoa

4403.52 --> 4409.88
lay it down then make him a giant Mosaic

4406.82 --> 4411.98
statue right now that is in every detail

4409.88 --> 4414.8
everything about it yeah that's what you

4411.98 --> 4417.44
do then and then I say go [ __ ] yourself

4414.8 --> 4421.54
right I'll do it when I ever damn please

4417.44 --> 4421.54
not when you're deciding to squirt

4424.94 --> 4431.239
that I can explain everything about it

4428.9 --> 4433.759999999999
every detail

4431.239 --> 4436.639999999999
at all in good time not when you are

4433.76 --> 4438.860000000001
wanting to rush it because you want it

4436.64 --> 4440.06
to burn out and die and go away so you

4438.86 --> 4442.88
can forget about it and then believe

4440.06 --> 4447.4400000000005
it's a [ __ ] Globe again yeah not

4442.88 --> 4449.7390000000005
cooperating with that little procedure

4447.44 --> 4449.739
foreign

4463.62 --> 4466.8099999999995
[Music]

4467.0 --> 4471.86
man time is flying

4469.76 --> 4475.06
can't believe

4471.86 --> 4475.0599999999995
it's been over an hour

4481.94 --> 4488.48
you're really just stick to geometric

4483.86 --> 4491.12
proof yeah yes so do we Black Swan yeah

4488.48 --> 4493.94
can't have terrestrial refractions not

4491.12 --> 4497.0599999999995
based on actual Optics and on how

4493.94 --> 4499.28
refraction works at all

4497.06 --> 4502.76
and

4499.28 --> 4504.94
you see very low observation are things

4502.76 --> 4508.219
that are very far away

4504.94 --> 4511.04
that shouldn't be possible geometrically

4508.219 --> 4513.52
on the globe Black Swan

4511.04 --> 4518.6
so yeah it's not bad to have us around

4513.52 --> 4522.1990000000005
so we can remind you how you are wrong

4518.6 --> 4525.38
because you are wrong if you say the

4522.199 --> 4529.159
Earth is a globe you're just wrong

4525.38 --> 4533.06
there's no other way out you're just

4529.159 --> 4537.139999999999
wrong you can't reason

4533.06 --> 4541.06
the earth into being a globe it isn't

4537.14 --> 4541.06
it it just isn't

4543.62 --> 4549.08
have I ever met Oakley sleeping Warrior

4546.5 --> 4551.54
and atom yes

4549.08 --> 4553.94
yes I have

4551.54 --> 4555.739
I don't know about Tony though but I

4553.94 --> 4557.48
have Nathan Oakley and Adam I met them

4555.739 --> 4561.08
in person

4557.48 --> 4561.08
yeah 2019.

4564.8 --> 4570.56
not sure no I don't think Tony was there

4567.86 --> 4573.199
and he wasn't even on the scene yet

4570.56 --> 4577.06
no he was

4573.199 --> 4577.0599999999995
no but I don't think he went there

4600.8 --> 4603.46
foreign

4603.699 --> 4610.04
dude whatever man you're just wrong

4607.46 --> 4611.42
if you think the Earth is a globe you're

4610.04 --> 4615.44
wrong

4611.42 --> 4618.26
Satan has your mind you're wrong it's

4615.44 --> 4621.32
not a globe the Earth is not a [ __ ]

4618.26 --> 4623.96
Globe you get it it's not a globe

4621.32 --> 4627.259999999999
there's no proof the Earth is a globe

4623.96 --> 4629.9
no proof no physical proof no measured

4627.26 --> 4633.02
proof the Earth is not a globe all you

4629.9 --> 4634.639999999999
do is just wiggle around with a bunch of

4633.02 --> 4636.8
stupid math

4634.64 --> 4638.6
spherical math everything has to be

4636.8 --> 4640.88
[ __ ] spherical because in reality

4638.6 --> 4642.679
it's all flat so you have to take all

4640.88 --> 4645.56
that Flat Earth measurements and then

4642.679 --> 4647.6
turn them into spherical nonsense

4645.56 --> 4651.02
it's all you got

4647.6 --> 4653.06
the Earth is flat it's not a globe it

4651.02 --> 4655.360000000001
never will be a globe it never was a

4653.06 --> 4655.360000000001
globe

4655.52 --> 4660.38
it's flat

4657.62 --> 4664.12
yeah the geometric orientation of the

4660.38 --> 4664.12
earth's surface is flat

4667.06 --> 4671.3
all right

4669.14 --> 4672.679
yeah you don't use any measurements

4671.3 --> 4675.56
avoid my marriage you're just a

4672.679 --> 4679.659
blabberger in chat you don't do [ __ ] you

4675.56 --> 4679.659000000001
haven't done anything but just blabber

4680.719 --> 4684.86
yeah

4682.34 --> 4688.04
you can't have a map

4684.86 --> 4691.759999999999
without flat Earth measurements

4688.04 --> 4693.44
yeah all maps based of celestial

4691.76 --> 4695.54
navigation

4693.44 --> 4697.5199999999995
yeah they all use

4695.54 --> 4699.739
Flat Earth

4697.52 --> 4703.6990000000005
bass lines

4699.739 --> 4706.28
yeah elevation angle

4703.699 --> 4708.5
all that [ __ ] I'm not measuring it quite

4706.28 --> 4712.179
as eloquent as the guys over at fed

4708.5 --> 4712.179
would but that's true

4712.219 --> 4719.659
you don't have any data you don't have

4717.32 --> 4723.92
any data

4719.659 --> 4726.679
that is not measured

4723.92 --> 4730.52
from a flat Earth

4726.679 --> 4732.56
it's all constructed designed

4730.52 --> 4736.76
the whole Celestial navigation the whole

4732.56 --> 4740.96
map making technology is all based on

4736.76 --> 4742.76
measuring Flat Earth you get a [ __ ]

4740.96 --> 4744.9800000000005
yeah come out there

4749.0 --> 4753.199
out show your face so you can kick you

4751.52 --> 4755.4800000000005
[ __ ] in the face

4753.199 --> 4757.759999999999
yeah

4755.48 --> 4761.299999999999

4757.76 --> 4764.1990000000005
boots you [ __ ] come in here

4761.3 --> 4764.1990000000005
squirt for me

4766.52 --> 4773.2390000000005
it's all flat it's all measured flat you

4770.0 --> 4776.0
don't have any data that is not measured

4773.239 --> 4779.0599999999995
from a flat plane you don't have the

4776.0 --> 4782.54
data you don't have actual spherical

4779.06 --> 4786.26
measurement data it doesn't exist

4782.54 --> 4789.679
you just bend it from a flat plane into

4786.26 --> 4792.14
your beloved [ __ ] sphere

4789.679 --> 4794.56
which doesn't exist it only exists in

4792.14 --> 4794.56
your math

4795.86 --> 4799.54
the Earth is flat

4814.699 --> 4818.299999999999
get the [ __ ] out of here

4816.92 --> 4821.08
I'm done with you

4818.3 --> 4821.08
piss off

4824.9 --> 4828.92
you're an idiot

4827.42 --> 4831.4400000000005
foreign

4828.92 --> 4833.36
who the [ __ ] calls themselves evil

4831.44 --> 4835.099999999999
nightmare anyway I should have just

4833.36 --> 4837.739
banned you for the [ __ ] name alone

4835.1 --> 4840.34
but like what [ __ ] [ __ ] calls

4837.739 --> 4840.339999999999
himself that

4842.179 --> 4848.38
you even know

4844.34 --> 4848.38
that you are like a Satanist

4848.719 --> 4852.44
do you even know a lot of satanists

4850.699 --> 4854.0599999999995
don't know their Satanist because

4852.44 --> 4855.32
they're just so [ __ ] [ __ ] they

4854.06 --> 4857.06
don't even know that they're in the

4855.32 --> 4859.099999999999
first world that everything they do is

4857.06 --> 4862.159000000001
all inside out

4859.1 --> 4865.96
you probably don't what kind of a weirdo

4862.159 --> 4865.96
would call themselves evil nightmare

4866.96 --> 4872.42
well a glober would because a glober

4870.26 --> 4874.76
yeah if you believe in a globe if you

4872.42 --> 4876.92
can turn everything that is real inside

4874.76 --> 4879.02
out well then you could do the same with

4876.92 --> 4882.14
everything else can't you yeah it means

4879.02 --> 4883.219
all just relatively like oh demonic is

4882.14 --> 4885.4400000000005
just cool

4883.219 --> 4889.84
this is popular

4885.44 --> 4889.839999999999
oh evil nightmare haha so funny

4890.0 --> 4895.58
Nightmare on flatters

4892.64 --> 4897.92
oh we're so scared you're oh you're so

4895.58 --> 4901.04
scary with your name

4897.92 --> 4903.8
evil nightmare you're just wrong though

4901.04 --> 4906.199
you're just stuck in hell in the

4903.8 --> 4908.54
Reversed world and you're an idiot the

4906.199 --> 4911.78
Earth is flat it's not a globe and if

4908.54 --> 4913.219
you truly truly believe it's a globe

4911.78 --> 4915.679
after everything

4913.219 --> 4918.28
then you are deaf blind and [ __ ]

4915.679 --> 4918.28
[ __ ]

4933.27 --> 4938.6
[Music]

4934.88 --> 4941.719
I'm just timing him out by the way but

4938.6 --> 4944.179
I mean Naval nightmares is a halfway

4941.719 --> 4946.159
decent conversationalist until it stops

4944.179 --> 4947.719
whining about the globe and today is the

4946.159 --> 4950.719
day today is the day where i'm gonna

4947.719 --> 4953.6
like oh yeah oh yeah

4950.719 --> 4956.179
you actually roll out glow proof or shut

4953.6 --> 4957.26
your [ __ ] mouth

4956.179 --> 4960.02
yeah

4957.26 --> 4962.3
not having your [ __ ]

4960.02 --> 4964.820000000001
you're not going to say oh no we have

4962.3 --> 4966.9800000000005
plenty of evidence into the globe you're

4964.82 --> 4970.46
not gonna do that today because I'm

4966.98 --> 4972.379999999999
gonna basically grind your [ __ ] head

4970.46 --> 4975.38
in the pavement

4972.38 --> 4979.219
like a millstone

4975.38 --> 4980.42
yeah that's what I'm gonna do

4979.219 --> 4983.36
today

4980.42 --> 4986.0
if you're gonna say Earth is really flat

4983.36 --> 4987.5
it's not flat it's your glue really oh

4986.0 --> 4989.96
yeah yeah what's your [ __ ] evidence

4987.5 --> 4993.5
for it I mean we've been doing this

4989.96 --> 4997.4
for eight years on a daily basis

4993.5 --> 4999.14
technical data to Perfection and like

4997.4 --> 5001.98
unseen

4999.14 --> 5001.9800000000005
to that level

5002.14 --> 5009.88
if you're still oh it's a globe really

5005.02 --> 5011.7390000000005
then you are demented and [ __ ]

5009.88 --> 5013.900000000001
you have no control over your own

5011.739 --> 5016.36
faculties if you still hang on to that

5013.9 --> 5019.12
you do not have control whatever the

5016.36 --> 5023.08
motivation behind it is whether you need

5019.12 --> 5025.9
to stick to what What You've Been Told

5023.08 --> 5028.239
for your job or for your social status

5025.9 --> 5031.299999999999
among your friends or whatever the [ __ ]

5028.239 --> 5033.04
it is if you still really insist it's a

5031.3 --> 5034.719
globe after having been exposed to the

5033.04 --> 5039.58
Flat Earth debate in my show for years

5034.719 --> 5043.4800000000005
and years then you are [ __ ] deranged

5039.58 --> 5046.48
you are not well in the head then

5043.48 --> 5046.48
provably

5058.12 --> 5064.42
no sleepy hasn't left Flat Earth he's

5061.12 --> 5067.96
just not Super Active that's all the guy

5064.42 --> 5070.54
do you even know who Tony is Tony is a

5067.96 --> 5074.76
busy man dude he has like

5070.54 --> 5074.76
multiple companies and [ __ ]

5075.4 --> 5081.639999999999
the guy is busy he's like an

5078.219 --> 5083.679
entrepreneur guy there in England so

5081.64 --> 5086.38
he's busy

5083.679 --> 5088.84
busy making quite a few bit of money

5086.38 --> 5091.1990000000005
actually he's a pretty decent business

5088.84 --> 5091.1990000000005
man

5092.44 --> 5095.159
I think

5095.56 --> 5100.719
I haven't heard him complain even once

5098.08 --> 5102.82
about oh my God I'm going broke and then

5100.719 --> 5106.12
not even once the guy knows what he's

5102.82 --> 5108.94
doing but he's not like he has a life

5106.12 --> 5111.36
outside of youtubing about flattering

5108.94 --> 5111.36
okay

5115.679 --> 5120.4800000000005
33 watching Illuminati confirmed low

5122.52 --> 5126.9400000000005
yeah

5124.48 --> 5130.139999999999
I watched a really silly movie American

5126.94 --> 5130.139999999999
X yeah I know

5130.48 --> 5136.718999999999
it wasn't specifically referencing that

5134.14 --> 5138.820000000001
it's just how I feel about it like today

5136.719 --> 5141.219
if you're gonna be like no it's really

5138.82 --> 5143.739
Globe I'm going to freaking torture you

5141.219 --> 5146.38
metaphorically

5143.739 --> 5148.299999999999
because I'm like no go [ __ ] yourself I

5146.38 --> 5151.3
don't want to hear the standard [ __ ]

5148.3 --> 5153.88
anymore you don't have proof you need to

5151.3 --> 5155.4400000000005
stop you need to stop whining about how

5153.88 --> 5158.26
you think the Earth is a globe there is

5155.44 --> 5161.259999999999
no proof it's not a globe it never was a

5158.26 --> 5164.02
globe it's never gonna be a globe

5161.26 --> 5166.360000000001
it's flat

5164.02 --> 5169.780000000001
and that's it

5166.36 --> 5173.799999999999
that's not all the data

5169.78 --> 5177.04
yeah we're not gonna replace as a flat

5173.8 --> 5181.900000000001
earther all that data that has all been

5177.04 --> 5184.12
filled in for you by Freaks and Liars

5181.9 --> 5187.259999999999
that want you to believe it's a globe so

5184.12 --> 5190.12
they fill it all in with nonsense data

5187.26 --> 5192.88
to make you feel like if you're going

5190.12 --> 5195.699
with that that you know a lot more it's

5192.88 --> 5196.719
all made up crap the Earth is not a

5195.699 --> 5200.138999999999
globe

5196.719 --> 5202.12
there may even be more land

5200.139 --> 5204.639
or ocean bottom however you want to see

5202.12 --> 5206.38
outside of what is the known territory

5204.639 --> 5209.02
that is being

5206.38 --> 5212.02
shown through Globe

5209.02 --> 5214.6
there might be more territory like a lot

5212.02 --> 5215.5
more yeah you're never gonna find out

5214.6 --> 5219.639
though

5215.5 --> 5221.02
but you think it's all just that globe

5219.639 --> 5223.84
it isn't

5221.02 --> 5226.84
it's not a globe it's flat and there's

5223.84 --> 5229.84
more mysteries about the realm

5226.84 --> 5232.78
like we don't have all the data and even

5229.84 --> 5236.1990000000005
like how it works

5232.78 --> 5238.42
we don't have all the data

5236.199 --> 5240.099999999999
nobody probably has maybe somebody

5238.42 --> 5242.56
figured it out and they're like keeping

5240.1 --> 5244.7390000000005
it in some Think Tank Tech Lab or

5242.56 --> 5244.7390000000005
whatever

5245.56 --> 5250.96
there's probably already technologies

5247.48 --> 5253.299999999999
that are very well using the real

5250.96 --> 5256.12
knowledge of the layout of the land and

5253.3 --> 5259.42
how things work here man they might even

5256.12 --> 5261.76
be able to like alter Celestial lights

5259.42 --> 5264.58
at this point

5261.76 --> 5267.04
but I don't know how they do that then

5264.58 --> 5269.5199999999995
though if they can

5267.04 --> 5274.12
I can

5269.52 --> 5275.92
visually like imagine how something sort

5274.12 --> 5279.4
of in what direction they would take it

5275.92 --> 5281.86
but I have no actual idea how they do it

5279.4 --> 5283.599999999999
if they would do that

5281.86 --> 5285.639
right

5283.6 --> 5287.5
the point is is that the realm is still

5285.639 --> 5289.36
still a very mysterious place we

5287.5 --> 5291.159
definitely do not know everything about

5289.36 --> 5294.42
it

5291.159 --> 5298.179
and the globe religion was there to

5294.42 --> 5301.0
Snuff out that Curiosity

5298.179 --> 5302.9800000000005
to say no it's all been understood like

5301.0 --> 5305.26
this is just a prison cell you've seen

5302.98 --> 5306.159
every corner of the prison cell that's

5305.26 --> 5308.76
it

5306.159 --> 5308.759999999999
yeah

5308.98 --> 5313.48
there's nothing else than that and that

5311.44 --> 5316.54
was always the trick

5313.48 --> 5320.138999999999
imprison you into the belief it's all

5316.54 --> 5322.659
been explored this is it there's no more

5320.139 --> 5324.219
need to look around because it's all

5322.659 --> 5326.62
been figured out

5324.219 --> 5329.679
and that way a prison in your mind is

5326.62 --> 5334.32
formed it's called a globe

5329.679 --> 5334.32
no more Mysteries not really

5335.02 --> 5338.7390000000005
no more mysteries about this place where

5337.239 --> 5340.839999999999
we are

5338.739 --> 5343.0599999999995
there's plenty of mysteries about this

5340.84 --> 5344.92
place where we are okay and I like to

5343.06 --> 5348.34
dig right through it

5344.92 --> 5352.36
with my conceptions yeah

5348.34 --> 5354.52
Celestial lights the celestial Holograms

5352.36 --> 5356.32
like what the [ __ ] are they

5354.52 --> 5360.42
why does that work

5356.32 --> 5360.42
how does it actually work

5361.42 --> 5364.6
what is it where's the energy coming

5362.98 --> 5368.739
from

5364.6 --> 5371.620000000001
how can a non-local hologram exist like

5368.739 --> 5373.178999999999
that how can that even be attempted to

5371.62 --> 5375.46
be emulated

5373.179 --> 5378.219
it's all very mysterious right there's

5375.46 --> 5379.54
just one factor just the lights

5378.219 --> 5382.0
yeah

5379.54 --> 5385.36
then you go okay what's the layout

5382.0 --> 5386.739
maybe space is not entirely linear gets

5385.36 --> 5390.46
really freaky

5386.739 --> 5392.0199999999995
yeah I think Valley freaky that that's

5390.46 --> 5393.34
what people are gonna associate that

5392.02 --> 5397.080000000001
with as soon as they start talking about

5393.34 --> 5397.08
maybe the realm is looping yeah

5398.139 --> 5402.219
people are like

5400.0 --> 5404.32
yeah I get it it's freaking weird it

5402.219 --> 5406.4800000000005
could be not saying it is but it could

5404.32 --> 5408.699
be there's definitely indication that

5406.48 --> 5412.5599999999995
space yeah

5408.699 --> 5415.839999999999
the way space is interconnected

5412.56 --> 5418.179
horizontally over the flat plane that

5415.84 --> 5420.400000000001
there may be some weird linearity issues

5418.179 --> 5423.6990000000005
there

5420.4 --> 5429.04
because it seems very difficult to just

5423.699 --> 5431.638999999999
represent the terrain exactly as is all

5429.04 --> 5435.46
at a consistent scale that seems to be

5431.639 --> 5438.159000000001
extremely elusive yes of my hint

5435.46 --> 5440.26
that's a hint to me like yeah space

5438.159 --> 5442.42
might not be entirely linear what could

5440.26 --> 5447.1
it be what can this

5442.42 --> 5450.3
this volume we are in what can it be

5447.1 --> 5450.3
how can that work

5451.6 --> 5457.3
right and then side Concepts come up

5454.239 --> 5459.04
like yeah well if there's a loop and

5457.3 --> 5461.139
there's a flat top because you can't

5459.04 --> 5463.06
Loop up to down all you could but then

5461.139 --> 5466.7390000000005
you'd have like the bottom of Earth at

5463.06 --> 5470.320000000001
the top it it would be weirder

5466.739 --> 5474.04
this is like there are then

5470.32 --> 5476.139
it would get just really weird it might

5474.04 --> 5478.78
be but I think that is more logical that

5476.139 --> 5482.02
it's just a flat top like the realm is

5478.78 --> 5484.239
just a layer and Loops horizontally but

5482.02 --> 5486.580000000001
vertically probably not and then there

5484.239 --> 5488.5599999999995
would be a barrier at the top and that

5486.58 --> 5491.5599999999995
barrier would not be an object it would

5488.56 --> 5494.38
simply be the end of volume for material

5491.56 --> 5498.1
to exist in

5494.38 --> 5501.9400000000005
which would be non-space

5498.1 --> 5504.400000000001
a space where literally no matter is

5501.94 --> 5506.919999999999
and can never be it would be

5504.4 --> 5509.259999999999
impenetrable immovable

5506.92 --> 5512.62
non-space

5509.26 --> 5514.780000000001
yeah so these are the conceptions that

5512.62 --> 5518.139
come out of the mystery

5514.78 --> 5520.239
of the realization and the proof that

5518.139 --> 5522.219
we're not living on a globe in outer

5520.239 --> 5523.08
space none of that makes any sense can't

5522.219 --> 5526.659
work

5523.08 --> 5529.179
violates natural law

5526.659 --> 5530.92
and the geometry just not does not add

5529.179 --> 5532.6
up it's all derived from a flat plane

5530.92 --> 5535.3
the entire glow construction is all

5532.6 --> 5537.9400000000005
derived from a flat plane all of it

5535.3 --> 5541.12
right so it's not all been discovered

5537.94 --> 5544.78
and there are still Mysteries

5541.12 --> 5546.04
and I liked it consider some of these

5544.78 --> 5548.62
Mysteries

5546.04 --> 5550.239
pick them up like Little Gems like oh

5548.62 --> 5553.179
look at that

5550.239 --> 5554.919999999999
Celestial non-local Holograms oh look at

5553.179 --> 5557.639
that

5554.92 --> 5561.76
space may not be entirely linear and

5557.639 --> 5564.9400000000005
looping even oh look at that yeah what's

5561.76 --> 5567.1
what's outside of it nothing yeah well

5564.94 --> 5571.32
what would that be like nothing well

5567.1 --> 5571.320000000001
non-space there you go

5572.44 --> 5577.12
see Mysteries and what could it what

5575.26 --> 5578.62
could be

5577.12 --> 5580.78
there is more

5578.62 --> 5582.58
Earth is not a globe it isn't a globe

5580.78 --> 5585.699
it's provably not a globe

5582.58 --> 5590.86
and that opens up Mysteries to be

5585.699 --> 5592.659
figured out exploring of understanding

5590.86 --> 5596.199
very close by we're not going to be

5592.659 --> 5597.94
dependent on sending billions to some

5596.199 --> 5600.159
agency

5597.94 --> 5604.32
to do it for us because we can't go

5600.159 --> 5604.32
there yeah we're not dependent on that

5604.36 --> 5611.5599999999995
it's all here on Earth the Earth itself

5608.1 --> 5615.04
aspects about it are a mystery

5611.56 --> 5616.360000000001
we don't need any agency to figure it

5615.04 --> 5619.8
out for us

5616.36 --> 5619.799999999999
to tell us how it is

5639.0 --> 5645.76
I'd still like to see like that I'd like

5642.82 --> 5648.46
to see the evidence of like paid trolls

5645.76 --> 5651.400000000001
like somebody could get like a pink slip

5648.46 --> 5654.04
for that and actually prove like this

5651.4 --> 5656.138999999999
man or a confession like yeah I was

5654.04 --> 5657.34
actually

5656.139 --> 5660.58
paid

5657.34 --> 5663.159000000001
to uh yeah to troll Flat Earth

5660.58 --> 5666.28
you see here is the contract this is my

5663.159 --> 5668.62
check I would love to see that

5666.28 --> 5670.54
please somebody proved to me that that

5668.62 --> 5671.679
actually happens that will be very

5670.54 --> 5674.199
fascinating

5671.679 --> 5676.78
right

5674.199 --> 5679.719
on the other hand there's space force

5676.78 --> 5683.0199999999995
out there and space force is definitely

5679.719 --> 5685.06
all about influencing media but I don't

5683.02 --> 5687.46
think they have like people that are

5685.06 --> 5689.4400000000005
just gonna be chat trolls

5687.46 --> 5691.6
I might be wrong maybe they are maybe

5689.44 --> 5694.259999999999
evil nightmare here is actually part of

5691.6 --> 5694.26
space force

5696.52 --> 5700.659000000001
could be

5698.5 --> 5703.6
I have a suspicion of other individuals

5700.659 --> 5705.759999999999
that are part of space force like one of

5703.6 --> 5709.860000000001
that guy that Nathan interviewed last

5705.76 --> 5709.860000000001
week or interviewed uh reviewed

5710.199 --> 5714.58
like the guy with the beard I don't

5712.239 --> 5717.638999999999
remember his name like that guy is like

5714.58 --> 5719.62
that guy space force the way he looks

5717.639 --> 5722.32
out of his eyes the way his images the

5719.62 --> 5725.0199999999995
way he talks that's that's like a an

5722.32 --> 5728.04
ex-military space force guy

5725.02 --> 5728.040000000001
that's what I thought

5728.38 --> 5732.28
space force is ridiculous yeah but

5730.06 --> 5734.639
that's the image of space force yes

5732.28 --> 5737.4
space force is like oh

5734.639 --> 5739.4800000000005
we're going to take back space

5737.4 --> 5742.96
it's all

5739.48 --> 5746.04
pure a propaganda machine

5742.96 --> 5751.4800000000005
space force is an operation to

5746.04 --> 5753.94
popularize and convince everybody space

5751.48 --> 5757.419999999999
to create that virtual ground and

5753.94 --> 5760.78
maintain that virtual ground as a as

5757.42 --> 5763.659
like a thing of America

5760.78 --> 5767.5
it's basically an operation it's a

5763.659 --> 5768.759999999999
Narnia agency it's an agency to protect

5767.5 --> 5772.98
Narnia

5768.76 --> 5772.9800000000005
that's pretty much what space force is

5773.08 --> 5775.5599999999995
really

5793.9 --> 5799.48
Pedro cut and pasted this generated

5796.3 --> 5803.26
response with paces and stuff really

5799.48 --> 5807.48
Taylor vision you oh that's amazing

5803.26 --> 5807.4800000000005
that that is that is something

5812.38 --> 5818.86
experience versus just oh you seem to be

5814.54 --> 5819.94
very eager to to emphasize that evil

5818.86 --> 5823.86
nightmare

5819.94 --> 5823.86
could could we've actually hit

5823.96 --> 5828.4
hit the nail on the head

5825.88 --> 5832.5
are you actually space force

5828.4 --> 5832.5
right evil nightmare are you

5833.32 --> 5837.159
seem to think it's so ridiculous you

5835.42 --> 5841.4400000000005
have to repeat it twice

5837.159 --> 5841.44
it's a very out of place response

5841.78 --> 5848.58
you don't see River cell yeah oh yeah

5844.3 --> 5848.58
yeah I think your space force

5860.08 --> 5864.04
what do you think guys blue pill

5861.76 --> 5866.38
Evolution LSG

5864.04 --> 5868.3
daily Vision you think that evil

5866.38 --> 5870.1
nightmare by the space force it seems to

5868.3 --> 5872.139
be very

5870.1 --> 5874.120000000001
not getting to the point with it oh it's

5872.139 --> 5876.46
ridiculous oh why why is it ridiculous

5874.12 --> 5880.38
what do you know about it

5876.46 --> 5880.38
why would you think it's ridiculous

5883.12 --> 5886.36
you don't know one person who joined the

5885.159 --> 5888.96
space force

5886.36 --> 5888.96
yeah

5889.179 --> 5894.0
why would you you think they'd just tell

5891.82 --> 5894.0
you

5895.78 --> 5901.0
it's like oh I Jer I I joined the secret

5899.739 --> 5905.138999999999
secrecy

5901.0 --> 5907.96
yeah well it's secret so you're not

5905.139 --> 5908.92
gonna really say that now are you oh

5907.96 --> 5910.42
you're going to be part of an

5908.92 --> 5912.219
influencing operation well guess what

5910.42 --> 5914.4400000000005
you're gonna do you're not gonna brag to

5912.219 --> 5916.78
everybody how you just got hired to be

5914.44 --> 5920.82
part of an influencing operation how do

5916.78 --> 5920.82
all you I mean come on

5929.02 --> 5933.9400000000005
when I was younger did I consider Dutch

5930.94 --> 5936.699
military service yes I did actually

5933.94 --> 5939.759999999999
consider it

5936.699 --> 5941.98
when I'm really glad that I didn't

5939.76 --> 5945.2390000000005
because I would have been rammed forward

5941.98 --> 5945.239
vaccine crap

5948.52 --> 5956.320000000001
like I wanted to it's just that not not

5953.38 --> 5959.400000000001
this not the way things are now like

5956.32 --> 5959.4
can't be trusted

5960.28 --> 5966.34
I mean if there was like a real anti-new

5963.639 --> 5969.04
world order thing going on

5966.34 --> 5972.52
then I probably would have joined if it

5969.04 --> 5975.58
was like really like National military

5972.52 --> 5979.06
then I would have probably joined

5975.58 --> 5980.98
but that wasn't the case even back then

5979.06 --> 5983.02
I didn't trust the military back then

5980.98 --> 5985.62
and my parents were also advising

5983.02 --> 5985.620000000001
against it

5997.3 --> 6001.400000000001
a space forces in the secret

6004.139 --> 6009.36
well that it exists is in the secret

6007.08 --> 6011.76
but you don't seem to know anybody that

6009.36 --> 6013.739
joined it even though I'm pretty sure

6011.76 --> 6016.6990000000005
there's a lot of people have been come

6013.739 --> 6016.699
part of it so

6019.92 --> 6024.7390000000005
Freddy what are you talking about Fred

6022.26 --> 6024.7390000000005
what

6036.9 --> 6045.299999999999
Beyond also okay all righty though okay

6042.0 --> 6047.52
well I'm gonna round out the show it's

6045.3 --> 6050.84
been fun although I don't know what the

6047.52 --> 6050.84
hell to call this show now

6051.659 --> 6055.638999999999
but maybe I'll just not call it anything

6073.8 --> 6078.179
right anyway

6076.139 --> 6081.12
whatever you are it doesn't really

6078.179 --> 6084.4800000000005
matter you're still a ball [ __ ] and

6081.12 --> 6087.54
that's really inexcusable

6084.48 --> 6089.638999999999
I mean the other ball cards that like to

6087.54 --> 6091.92
hang around here even were wise enough

6089.639 --> 6093.6
not to pipe up when I was saying all

6091.92 --> 6096.06
those things because they know there's

6093.6 --> 6098.400000000001
no point they know I'm right they just

6096.06 --> 6100.92
can't let go of the ball

6098.4 --> 6103.94
but apparently you're not there yet

6100.92 --> 6103.9400000000005
