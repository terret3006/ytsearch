[Music]

77.72 --> 82.46
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

81.18 --> 85.68
bird number

82.46 --> 87.29899999999999
1172 I'm your host Arwin and before we

weekdays and 2PM Amsterdam time in the

100.74 --> 105.78
weekend please also do support me

103.32 --> 107.22
through the PayPal patreon crypto wallet

105.78 --> 109.43900000000001
Super Chat and the membership system

107.22 --> 112.1
join button they'll be much appreciated

109.439 --> 115.32
you can still use it

112.1 --> 118.28
trying to

115.32 --> 118.27999999999999
let my chat

118.979 --> 122.0
there you go

123.96 --> 128.64
right

125.36 --> 130.08
yeah sorry for being so late it's really

128.64 --> 132.79999999999998
late this time so it's going to be a

130.08 --> 132.8
short show today

133.28 --> 137.9
foreign so the weather today is quite

136.8 --> 142.14000000000001
beautiful

137.9 --> 146.459
it's wind still it's sunny

142.14 --> 148.26
there's Cloud stuff up there though

146.459 --> 149.94
I get the feeling yeah there's been

148.26 --> 152.94
spraying

149.94 --> 155.28
again very early and

152.94 --> 157.07999999999998
it's turning hazy again so I think that

155.28 --> 159.9
whatever

157.08 --> 162.59900000000002
is directing the weather here they want

159.9 --> 163.8
things to kind of rain I guess instead

162.599 --> 165.72
of this

163.8 --> 169.44
because this is exactly what also

165.72 --> 172.019
happened the day before yesterday when

169.44 --> 174.12
it then got super cloudy and rainy so I

172.019 --> 177.5
think that probably tomorrow is going to

174.12 --> 177.5
be cloudy and rainy again

177.959 --> 183.56
hey butterfly

180.9 --> 183.56
that's cute

184.08 --> 188.34
all right anyway it's beautiful weather

185.519 --> 191.54
out there and

188.34 --> 191.54
lots of people outside

204.72 --> 210.12
low wrath first in chat Bill Nye the

207.54 --> 216.68
science denier Gadget inspector keflar

210.12 --> 216.68
Elise G clutch Bex good to see you all

221.4 --> 226.86
yeah I'm very late today because kind of

224.76 --> 230.159
a late night

226.86 --> 234.54000000000002
I I really needed to sleep in this

230.159 --> 238.099
morning so I kind of yeah I woke up

234.54 --> 238.099
right after one o'clock

238.68 --> 243.5
I just really needed it I think but it's

241.379 --> 246.42
also because I stayed up late

243.5 --> 248.599
I kind of wanted to go early to bed and

246.42 --> 248.599
then

248.7 --> 253.07999999999998
I just kind of had to watch the State of

250.86 --> 255.54000000000002
the Union live

253.08 --> 256.68
I I watched it for a lift Avail on dear

255.54 --> 258.959
life

256.68 --> 262.1
but it just kind of had to watch it and

258.959 --> 262.1
join the commentary

264.78 --> 268.25899999999996
right

265.919 --> 271.15999999999997
but I really need to learn to just go to

268.259 --> 271.16
bed a little earlier

271.38 --> 276.84
making a bad habit out of going to bed

273.6 --> 279.259
for reasons very late

276.84 --> 279.25899999999996
yeah

284.34 --> 289.94
hello Professor Phil Bell

287.04 --> 289.94
Matthew Hall

290.28 --> 293.0
Adam Price

295.74 --> 302.46000000000004
right but yeah State of the Union was

298.38 --> 306.139
kind of hysterical I mean hysterical in

302.46 --> 306.13899999999995
a bad way also because

306.24 --> 311.52
I don't know I I kind of made it a

308.22 --> 313.02000000000004
little bit of a trick to just reading

311.52 --> 315.12
whatever they're saying and then

313.02 --> 316.68
actually translate that to what they're

315.12 --> 320.1
actually going to do which is going to

316.68 --> 323.72
be pretty much exactly the opposite

320.1 --> 323.72
and that was what I was doing

324.66 --> 328.97900000000004
Nancy Pelosi was like on drugs or

327.479 --> 330.9
something

328.979 --> 333.139
like at some point she just sat there

330.9 --> 333.13899999999995
like

333.62 --> 340.46
like she was high as a kite on something

336.479 --> 340.46
it was really silly

340.919 --> 344.21999999999997
and then she even did like a couple of

343.02 --> 347.09999999999997
weird moves

344.22 --> 348.66
so yeah me and others in the chat that

347.1 --> 351.24
were talking about it we're like yeah

348.66 --> 353.52000000000004
man she's like really she's tripping

351.24 --> 355.199
balls on something and at some point

353.52 --> 356.639
it's kind of wearing off and she started

355.199 --> 360.979
to look like

356.639 --> 360.979
but then it turns back on after Biden

361.44 --> 365.479
started talking about what is it again

366.24 --> 372.62
about illegal or not really about

370.38 --> 376.08
preventing

372.62 --> 378.539
corporations from Gathering data on

376.08 --> 381.419
little children and then he got all

378.539 --> 383.94
super awoke and she got all happy smiley

381.419 --> 389.06
face it was just so weird

383.94 --> 389.06
like these people are such freaks guys

389.699 --> 392.3
nowhere

392.58 --> 396.65999999999997
anyway

393.66 --> 396.66
306

418.979 --> 423.84
wow

421.319 --> 426.0
I think I may have

423.84 --> 428.15999999999997
gotten a bit of a cold

426.0 --> 431.28
and I blame that one coffee because it

428.16 --> 434.3
did start up yesterday but like now it's

431.28 --> 434.29999999999995
really annoying

438.9 --> 441.44
anyway

452.28 --> 456.0
all right Professor filbert asked so

454.259 --> 458.46000000000004
what do you think of past Black Sea

456.0 --> 461.34
Above The Thin Blue Area when we look at

458.46 --> 463.919
footage from a high altitude yeah it's

461.34 --> 466.4
very mysterious what that is Professor

463.919 --> 466.4
Phil Bell

467.879 --> 474.41900000000004
I don't really understand

471.18 --> 476.46
like what is causing it to start looking

474.419 --> 477.71999999999997
like that specifically

476.46 --> 481.25899999999996
why

477.72 --> 483.53900000000004
does the change suggest like the blue is

481.259 --> 484.91900000000004
closed down Earth

483.539 --> 487.56
unless

484.919 --> 489.0
well from a holographic Celestial

487.56 --> 490.74
perspective

489.0 --> 493.62
we would have to consider that the blue

490.74 --> 495.599
is kind of part of the celestials

493.62 --> 497.879
like the entire background color it is

495.599 --> 499.139
described in the Bible too you know the

497.879 --> 501.96000000000004
daylight

499.139 --> 503.759
but it is not a luminary but it is like

501.96 --> 505.62
in the same

503.759 --> 508.259
line it's like

505.62 --> 510.599
daylight and the night and then the

508.259 --> 512.96
celestials right after so they are kind

510.599 --> 512.96
of together

514.019 --> 518.539
yeah the blue is daylight no [ __ ] free

516.06 --> 518.539
minded

519.959 --> 524.6999999999999
but since a lot of the celestials become

523.38 --> 527.519
different

524.7 --> 530.72
when you go up really high and said that

527.519 --> 530.72
stars just disappear

530.94 --> 537.6
then

533.04 --> 539.8199999999999
well maybe the blue disappearing is part

537.6 --> 542.76
of that

539.82 --> 545.399
the same reason as to why the celestial

542.76 --> 546.959
lights like stars disappear

545.399 --> 549.24
is the same reason why the blue

546.959 --> 553.9799999999999
disappears because it's like out of

549.24 --> 556.019
range of for the celestial effects

553.98 --> 559.2
to happen

556.019 --> 561.48
for the holographics to function

559.2 --> 565.1600000000001
you need to be closed down Earth I don't

561.48 --> 565.16
know that's that's the mechanical

566.04 --> 570.36
information that I can extract out of it

568.62 --> 573.36
but that's pretty much as far as it goes

570.36 --> 575.94
I don't know why

573.36 --> 578.42
why it does it like that but there is a

575.94 --> 578.4200000000001
correlation

589.22 --> 594.899
past fewer days with the gold

592.92 --> 597.5
in bed wow that must have been really

594.899 --> 597.5
bad then

597.899 --> 603.839
yeah I just I just get snotty sometimes

601.5 --> 607.079
and

603.839 --> 609.3000000000001
sneeze unexpectedly and all that that's

607.079 --> 611.2399999999999
it there's like really super basic

609.3 --> 614.8389999999999
called

611.24 --> 614.839
it's not much else

630.2 --> 634.76
hey seeking star water good to see you

660.6 --> 667.2
that's why thick glass is blue uh that's

665.64 --> 669.42
not always true

667.2 --> 671.519
Professor Phil it all depends on the

669.42 --> 673.5
type of glass

671.519 --> 676.32
they're thick

673.5 --> 677.64
glass that becomes naturally kind of

676.32 --> 679.2
greenish

677.64 --> 682.4399999999999
as well

679.2 --> 683.94
by the way just like ocean

682.44 --> 687.0600000000001
yeah

683.94 --> 691.0790000000001
like a regular water

687.06 --> 693.4799999999999
Sweet Water May sort of turn bluish in a

691.079 --> 696.3599999999999
large mass when you look through it but

693.48 --> 699.44
ocean water with salt in it it actually

696.36 --> 699.44
turns green

699.72 --> 704.0400000000001
right

701.72 --> 706.519
so you're off there a little Professor

704.04 --> 706.519
Phil bill

719.399 --> 725.339
am i coughing or that's hilarious Gadget

722.76 --> 727.38
inspector no I'm sneezing when I'm on

725.339 --> 730.5600000000001
mute like that

727.38 --> 732.779
sneezing and blowing my nose like I have

730.56 --> 735.3
a lot of unexpected sneezing even when

732.779 --> 736.56
I'm not having like cold symptoms about

735.3 --> 740.0999999999999
anything

736.56 --> 741.959
I've kind of like resorted to blame it

740.1 --> 744.4200000000001
to allergies

741.959 --> 747.42
it just happens randomly like even

744.42 --> 750.0
throughout the whole last two years in

747.42 --> 751.74
the supermarket for some damn reason

750.0 --> 755.72
it's always like I don't know where

751.74 --> 755.72
suddenly I have to sneeze like once

756.66 --> 764.54
and then I'm like God damn it because

760.68 --> 764.54
yeah unwanted attention

765.18 --> 769.62
but

767.1 --> 770.94
but that's just like random sneezing it

769.62 --> 774.92
doesn't even

770.94 --> 774.9200000000001
make me snotty or anything I don't know

776.22 --> 780.0790000000001
alright so just blame allergies

799.56 --> 805.04
no Terror 306 that sounds like wishful

802.56 --> 805.04
thinking

814.74 --> 818.16
ah

816.24 --> 820.639
okay seeking Star Wars that sounds

818.16 --> 820.639
interesting

822.839 --> 827.399
right yeah when you're gonna do that

824.82 --> 831.12
don't forget to link it up in my chat so

827.399 --> 835.22
people can actually check it out

831.12 --> 835.22
I don't know who awesome Austin is

844.56 --> 848.1199999999999
oops clutch what

868.68 --> 871.579
oh

881.82 --> 886.4590000000001
spinning wheel

883.8 --> 886.459
what

914.16 --> 921.019
it's still scattered light like this guy

918.24 --> 921.019
uh

921.959 --> 927.079
you mean that's the theory behind it

924.3 --> 927.079
right

928.5 --> 932.6
I mean you can't really prove that

938.459 --> 943.4399999999999
I mean that's like the most logical

940.86 --> 946.38
to-go conclusion that the blue light

943.44 --> 948.5400000000001
from the daylight is this scattering

946.38 --> 951.36
through the atmosphere whatever

948.54 --> 953.699
but you can't actually test that right

951.36 --> 957.36
if you try to emulate it by creating

953.699 --> 960.42
this massive massive bright lamp thing

957.36 --> 962.4590000000001
that will be like insanely bright like

960.42 --> 964.199
really insanely bright that would shine

962.459 --> 966.54
like

964.199 --> 969.12
a hundred kilometers still visible or

966.54 --> 972.24
something and you

969.12 --> 974.399
well then you could test like during the

972.24 --> 976.5600000000001
night like okay is this actually gonna

974.399 --> 978.839
cause the same blue scattering when we

976.56 --> 981.06
brighten up things

978.839 --> 982.44
as close as we can get to the brightness

981.06 --> 986.5189999999999
of the Sun

982.44 --> 990.48
and then you could potentially test that

986.519 --> 992.639
right but just a regular lamp over a

990.48 --> 994.8000000000001
distance in the night is not causing

992.639 --> 997.759
like scattering blueness

994.8 --> 997.7589999999999
that doesn't happen

999.0 --> 1003.079
so

1001.339 --> 1005.12
this guy being blue because of

1003.079 --> 1007.699
scattering is

1005.12 --> 1011.18
a go-to conclusion that doesn't actually

1007.699 --> 1014.74
have any empirical testing to it

1011.18 --> 1014.7399999999999
it just seems logical

1026.48 --> 1032.24
remove the light and yeah no [ __ ] remove

1029.12 --> 1034.28
the light and it turns black yeah thanks

1032.24 --> 1037.4
wow

1034.28 --> 1040.52
yeah that part's correct

1037.4 --> 1042.14
but that's not what it's about oh it it

1040.52 --> 1044.24
turns black when you turn the light off

1042.14 --> 1046.88
that means that the blue light in the

1044.24 --> 1047.959
sky is scattering of the sunlight uh

1046.88 --> 1052.179
what

1047.959 --> 1052.179
no that doesn't mean that at all

1053.24 --> 1058.58
send the pic what

1056.6 --> 1061.539
oh

1058.58 --> 1061.539
you mean to my email

1065.24 --> 1069.74
right

1067.46 --> 1071.8400000000001
oh the spinning wheel oh wow that thing

1069.74 --> 1073.76
looks pretty cool

1071.84 --> 1076.6599999999999
oh wow that's like a really

1073.76 --> 1076.66
old-fashioned

1078.02 --> 1082.6399999999999
completely wooden

1079.94 --> 1086.2
looks Epic

1082.64 --> 1086.2
you know how to work that thing

1087.919 --> 1090.5200000000002
huh

1101.059 --> 1104.72
let me uh

1102.98 --> 1108.039
if I may

1104.72 --> 1108.039
like to show that

1108.5 --> 1114.039
picture of that

1110.9 --> 1114.039
seeking style water

1115.76 --> 1120.82
I guess I will

1118.1 --> 1120.82
uh

1134.9 --> 1138.88
right

1136.1 --> 1138.8799999999999
that's it

1142.34 --> 1145.299
yeah pretty cool

1146.299 --> 1149.2
foreign

1193.039 --> 1197.86
well that's a pretty epic skill if

1194.9 --> 1197.8600000000001
you're trying to work with that

1199.43 --> 1201.8200000000002
[Music]

1199.82 --> 1201.82
um

1235.4 --> 1240.38
The Thin Blue Area is around 30

1238.159 --> 1243.44
kilometers thick oh really did you

1240.38 --> 1247.72
measure that Professor Phil Bell

1243.44 --> 1247.72
or was that a calculation

1248.72 --> 1255.44
like how do you even measure that

1251.6 --> 1259.6589999999999
how thick the blue layer is at the

1255.44 --> 1263.5
Horizon how do you measure that

1259.659 --> 1263.5
I don't think you can

1294.86 --> 1300.6789999999999
well George Sanford to be fair Professor

1297.44 --> 1302.9
philbel was suggesting the thick

1300.679 --> 1305.659
right it's very non-specific but the

1302.9 --> 1308.3200000000002
thick of the atmosphere but it's still

1305.659 --> 1308.3200000000002
like I

1309.2 --> 1315.14
that's just an estimate

1311.96 --> 1317.059
it's just a presumed estimate because

1315.14 --> 1321.039
like how do you measure that it's

1317.059 --> 1321.039
supposedly 30 kilometers thick

1322.34 --> 1327.32
and that that is like what you're gonna

1325.039 --> 1330.14
measure the blue part

1327.32 --> 1333.3999999999999
at the Horizon how

1330.14 --> 1333.4
how do you do that

1334.76 --> 1339.86
satellites yeah but the satellites won't

1337.1 --> 1342.08
see it as a blue part at the heart it

1339.86 --> 1346.28
doesn't make any sense even if you

1342.08 --> 1346.28
assume that they did exist Godzilla

1348.799 --> 1354.28
enter it from

1350.78 --> 1354.28
I out what

1354.74 --> 1360.86
oh really can you describe the process

1357.86 --> 1365.02
of measuring from a high altitude

1360.86 --> 1365.02
balloon professor philbel

1395.96 --> 1399.7
don't do that Kevlar

1417.2 --> 1423.039
hey thank you Bex for the

1420.02 --> 1423.039
Super Chat

1442.58 --> 1445.36
hmm

1445.7 --> 1449.3600000000001
I still haven't gotten an answer though

1447.799 --> 1452.6
Phil

1449.36 --> 1454.9399999999998
like you said balloons measure it how

1452.6 --> 1457.4189999999999
can you describe the process of how they

1454.94 --> 1457.419
measure it

1462.32 --> 1465.1
foreign

1472.1 --> 1477.9399999999998
oh all right Bex thanks I would really

1475.159 --> 1477.94
appreciate that

1483.1 --> 1489.02
wow well thanks

1486.2 --> 1492.14
thanks for the description

1489.02 --> 1494.74
of what you kind of see how's that

1492.14 --> 1494.74
measuring

1496.039 --> 1502.7
how did the High Altitude balloon

1498.38 --> 1505.7
measure how high the blue is

1502.7 --> 1507.559
based on your description of what it

1505.7 --> 1509.72
kind of looks like when it transits

1507.559 --> 1513.46
that's that's cute right I know that's

1509.72 --> 1513.46
how it looks it's really interesting

1516.17 --> 1521.96
[Music]

1518.84 --> 1525.6789999999999
like even William Shatner in his after

1521.96 --> 1528.38
talk experience with the blue origin was

1525.679 --> 1530.0590000000002
like oh yeah that transition is just a

1528.38 --> 1532.46
thin blue that's but it's all

1530.059 --> 1535.1589999999999
descriptions it's description of the

1532.46 --> 1538.76
experience how is that a measurement

1535.159 --> 1542.0590000000002
how do you derive 30 kilometers

1538.76 --> 1544.64
from an observation just looking at it

1542.059 --> 1547.1589999999999
and describing what it looks like how

1544.64 --> 1549.8200000000002
did how does that measure up to 30

1547.159 --> 1549.8200000000002
kilometers

1552.62 --> 1556.9599999999998
oh something wrong with PayPal all right

1557.36 --> 1564.52
Simpson fine working order to me

1561.2 --> 1564.52
but yeah maybe it's

1564.74 --> 1570.52
not working for you right now

1567.86 --> 1570.52
hmm

1592.159 --> 1596.2990000000002
oh

1593.659 --> 1601.2990000000002
so there is something wrong with PayPal

1596.299 --> 1601.299
oh hope that's not gonna be like lasting

1603.919 --> 1610.539
I mean I can just still go there but

1606.559 --> 1610.539
maybe just the money transfer

1612.08 --> 1614.6789999999999
and working

1630.44 --> 1638.559
to log into your sock account

1634.58 --> 1638.559
who are you talking to Darren saw

1641.72 --> 1646.059
it's PayPal Russian no definitely not

1671.36 --> 1673.539
foreign

1703.46 --> 1707.96
I'm just noticing how Phil Bell hasn't

1706.22 --> 1710.1200000000001
actually answered my question even

1707.96 --> 1712.46
though I just calmly asked it and gave

1710.12 --> 1715.899
him a whole lot of time

1712.46 --> 1715.8990000000001
I'm not even ridiculing

1717.62 --> 1723.34
yes it is blood

1719.299 --> 1723.34
for people not to be working

1724.279 --> 1730.52
well they've already look PayPal already

1726.799 --> 1733.1
basically does like political blocking

1730.52 --> 1736.279
I really hope they haven't now targeted

1733.1 --> 1739.6999999999998
me because I'm I'm a freaking Oracle I'm

1736.279 --> 1743.12
always gonna say the most

1739.7 --> 1744.6200000000001
extreme things

1743.12 --> 1748.12
right

1744.62 --> 1748.12
it's what you do

1749.779 --> 1755.12
I'm literally

1752.059 --> 1758.72
acting and sometimes I support the ACT

1755.12 --> 1762.3799999999999
but I'm like living into positions and

1758.72 --> 1765.3990000000001
trying to then like basically back

1762.38 --> 1765.3990000000001
engineer everything

1766.399 --> 1772.1
so yeah but I don't know they haven't

1769.159 --> 1774.6200000000001
really targeted me thus far like there's

1772.1 --> 1778.48
not like oh I'm logged into PayPal it's

1774.62 --> 1781.34
not like oh oh you got a warning because

1778.48 --> 1784.039
you were a Russian supervisor no no

1781.34 --> 1786.559
nothing like that so doesn't seem to be

1784.039 --> 1789.679
anything wrong

1786.559 --> 1793.8799999999999
but look it's

1789.679 --> 1795.799
it's still just a program also

1793.88 --> 1798.5
they might have an update or something

1795.799 --> 1801.98
right they might need to like

1798.5 --> 1804.799
hold off all kinds of transfers at the

1801.98 --> 1806.84
moment to work something out

1804.799 --> 1809.179
right

1806.84 --> 1811.48
it's just like an update could be that I

1809.179 --> 1811.48
don't know

1819.08 --> 1823.4189999999999
oh my God here he goes again Phil

1823.76 --> 1830.539
a satellite

1826.159 --> 1832.279
eh supposed satellite gives you top down

1830.539 --> 1835.1
views

1832.279 --> 1839.24
how are you gonna measure

1835.1 --> 1843.86
the blue band at the horizon

1839.24 --> 1847.039
with a top down view image

1843.86 --> 1848.779
I mean have you even allowed yourself to

1847.039 --> 1853.48
like

1848.779 --> 1853.48
visually think about what you're saying

1854.179 --> 1860.1200000000001
how does it measure that

1857.179 --> 1863.96
it just gives top-down views

1860.12 --> 1866.7199999999998
blue bar that's the Horizon that's not

1863.96 --> 1867.74
top down that's to the Horizon to the

1866.72 --> 1870.38
side

1867.74 --> 1874.88
satellites don't give you those types of

1870.38 --> 1877.1200000000001
photographs ever I've never seen one of

1874.88 --> 1877.1200000000001
those

1877.58 --> 1883.6399999999999
right they they might say oh this is a

1881.419 --> 1887.24
satellite photograph and then they show

1883.64 --> 1891.279
you the globe but it's always

1887.24 --> 1891.279
Photoshop because it has to be

1892.7 --> 1898.24
because it's constructed out of top-down

1895.76 --> 1898.24
images

1899.84 --> 1905.899
it doesn't actually show you a horizon

1903.019 --> 1908.8990000000001
when you look at a photograph of the

1905.899 --> 1912.86
planet whatever the Blue Marble and you

1908.899 --> 1915.9799999999998
look to the sides of it guess what

1912.86 --> 1917.299
there's no Blue Sky

1915.98 --> 1921.559
there

1917.299 --> 1924.86
there's no 20 kilometer thick blue bar

1921.559 --> 1927.86
that nothing nothing is there

1924.86 --> 1928.76
because it's Photoshop because it has to

1927.86 --> 1930.6789999999999
be

1928.76 --> 1932.6589999999999
that's the Blue Marble type of

1930.679 --> 1935.179
photographs which are in photographs

1932.659 --> 1939.0800000000002
they're edited

1935.179 --> 1943.24
top down views into a ball

1939.08 --> 1943.24
they don't measure the horizons

1943.34 --> 1950.26
it's based on the uh there you go there

1946.94 --> 1951.98
you I told you told you guys

1950.26 --> 1955.8799999999999
calculated

1951.98 --> 1959.72
he calculated that's not measuring he

1955.88 --> 1962.5390000000002
didn't measure it he calculated it

1959.72 --> 1964.64
thank you

1962.539 --> 1968.74
thank you for proving my point that I

1964.64 --> 1968.74
was trying to make like 15 minutes ago

1971.419 --> 1975.5800000000002
hey metal slugs cockatiel

1982.46 --> 1985.48
hey hello Jose

1991.399 --> 1994.36
uh

2016.299 --> 2021.4189999999999
that weird fish guy what are you talking

2019.179 --> 2021.419
about

2035.799 --> 2040.0
oh that comment well so you're just not

2037.899 --> 2041.559
addressing it then

2040.0 --> 2044.019
right

2041.559 --> 2046.6589999999999
well I was just

2044.019 --> 2049.419
responding Professor Phil I was just

2046.659 --> 2051.339
responding in case you were gonna use

2049.419 --> 2054.6589999999997
that as an argument and how to measure

2051.339 --> 2054.659
it you just didn't answer it

2057.639 --> 2062.02
but I already know you can only

2059.98 --> 2063.94
calculate it because if you would be

2062.02 --> 2066.82
able to measure it you would have

2063.94 --> 2069.399
described to me how you measured it

2066.82 --> 2070.54
instead you just keep calling it

2069.399 --> 2072.7599999999998
measuring

2070.54 --> 2075.2799999999997
and it's not actually measuring we know

2072.76 --> 2078.2200000000003
it's calculation you don't need to

2075.28 --> 2080.8
confess that you calculated and not

2078.22 --> 2083.2599999999998
measure it for us to know that as a fact

2080.8 --> 2085.7200000000003
because there's no other options that

2083.26 --> 2088.679
are available to you

2085.72 --> 2088.6789999999996
Professor Phil

2097.0 --> 2101.56
memorized satellite to work with now

2099.88 --> 2103.0
they have spec they don't yeah they

2101.56 --> 2105.7599999999998
don't have

2103.0 --> 2109.38
there's like telescope they have like

2105.76 --> 2109.38
telescopes basically

2110.8 --> 2114.82
like they're super super special big

2113.56 --> 2117.66
lenses

2114.82 --> 2117.6600000000003
Broad View

2125.5 --> 2130.5
yeah it's more than HD get a genius

2128.079 --> 2130.5
vector

2153.88 --> 2158.7000000000003
how do those cameras work in extreme

2156.16 --> 2158.7
colds

2162.82 --> 2169.26
what why would you think that they

2165.52 --> 2169.2599999999998
wouldn't be working in extreme cold

2193.119 --> 2200.52
try to use a camera out in the cold yeah

2196.9 --> 2200.52
but that's different George Sanford

2200.74 --> 2208.839
because that's ground level with cold

2204.76 --> 2212.82
air and moist that is cold right

2208.839 --> 2212.82
that's super difficult

2213.04 --> 2219.099
because there's a lot of cold transfer

2216.04 --> 2220.72
right well in the super high altitude

2219.099 --> 2223.839
supposedly

2220.72 --> 2227.74
if it would be that cold

2223.839 --> 2230.2
there's not a lot of moist there

2227.74 --> 2233.8799999999997
so I don't see why that would be

2230.2 --> 2233.8799999999997
problematic for the camera

2238.42 --> 2241.079
hmm

2259.24 --> 2263.64
okay what are you talking about

2264.339 --> 2272.38
field of view of your optic

2268.859 --> 2275.44
and the size of your camera sensor

2272.38 --> 2279.1800000000003
you can understand the size of what's in

2275.44 --> 2279.18
the picture without measuring a thing

2280.96 --> 2285.2200000000003
yeah but when you say what's in the

2283.9 --> 2288.94
picture

2285.22 --> 2291.22
unless you're talking about objects

2288.94 --> 2293.26
right because yeah as an object and then

2291.22 --> 2296.0789999999997
there's a scaling issue and then you can

2293.26 --> 2298.6600000000003
deduce it measure it right we were

2296.079 --> 2302.4
talking about the thickness of a blue

2298.66 --> 2302.3999999999996
background color thing

2303.04 --> 2306.72
that's still not measuring

2308.74 --> 2315.22
right it's still just like it because

2311.92 --> 2317.2000000000003
because it is the background it's at the

2315.22 --> 2320.3199999999997
horizon

2317.2 --> 2323.68
like oh it's in view how do you still

2320.32 --> 2325.54
have to then kind of just determine if

2323.68 --> 2326.56
for a calculation what the parameters

2325.54 --> 2328.44
are

2326.56 --> 2330.82
gonna have to like input a

2328.44 --> 2333.18
presuppositional setting for the

2330.82 --> 2337.3590000000004
assumptions because it's at the Horizon

2333.18 --> 2339.3999999999996
how do you measure how thick that is

2337.359 --> 2342.4
it's literally Out Of Reach you don't

2339.4 --> 2344.5
have like a scalar Factor

2342.4 --> 2347.7400000000002
it's not an object

2344.5 --> 2351.04
that you can triangulate and then like

2347.74 --> 2352.0789999999997
compare its exact size etc etc to be

2351.04 --> 2355.98
certain

2352.079 --> 2355.98
that was the whole issue

2356.32 --> 2364.6600000000003
how do you measure how thick the blue

2360.46 --> 2367.18
band over Earth is when you go up high

2364.66 --> 2368.3199999999997
altitude how do you measure that you

2367.18 --> 2373.5
can't

2368.32 --> 2373.5
it's at the Horizon it's not an object

2375.099 --> 2379.619
anyway hello Pocono let's see you

2401.98 --> 2405.76
know exactly what altitude the balloon

2404.8 --> 2410.819
is

2405.76 --> 2410.8190000000004
oh so you mean you're just gonna base

2410.859 --> 2417.5789999999997
how thick you think it is how thick it

2413.92 --> 2421.119
appears to the camera

2417.579 --> 2423.7000000000003
and then just say oh the balloon is at

2421.119 --> 2427.42
this height that means that we're going

2423.7 --> 2429.3999999999996
to just say that's exactly how high

2427.42 --> 2432.76
the blue part is

2429.4 --> 2435.099
because it was roughly at eye level at

2432.76 --> 2440.0400000000004
that point is that it you're just gonna

2435.099 --> 2440.04
deduce it based on Raw visuals

2444.52 --> 2450.7599999999998
right that's still not

2447.88 --> 2454.0
yeah that's still treating it like it's

2450.76 --> 2456.6400000000003
supposedly an object and it's not

2454.0 --> 2458.98
it's background it's on the background

2456.64 --> 2461.7999999999997
it's not an object in

2458.98 --> 2464.16
in 3D space you're trying to size up

2461.8 --> 2464.1600000000003
there

2467.56 --> 2474.52
check your PayPal oh it's still working

2470.68 --> 2477.96
okay Paul Connell thanks check it out

2474.52 --> 2477.96
but sure use the support

2478.119 --> 2482.02
still got debts still need to get

2480.099 --> 2485.44
through this month oh thank you very

2482.02 --> 2489.9
much man I really appreciate that

2485.44 --> 2489.9
almost 30 Euros so I can really use that

2493.3 --> 2495.96
thank you

2496.18 --> 2501.52
that certainly made my day

2499.48 --> 2503.619
thank you guys for all your continuing

2501.52 --> 2505.359
support I really hope

2503.619 --> 2508.7200000000003
I deliver

2505.359 --> 2511.839
I'm doing my best right

2508.72 --> 2514.839
but these are good times right now for

2511.839 --> 2518.5
me I've been through like rough times

2514.839 --> 2520.0
with pain and nausea

2518.5 --> 2524.94
and

2520.0 --> 2524.94
I guess demoralization a bit

2525.88 --> 2529.96
on the edge of it

2527.56 --> 2531.339
but now with like every time the sun

2529.96 --> 2534.04
comes by

2531.339 --> 2536.98
I feel the spring is in the I I feel so

2534.04 --> 2541.06
much stronger right now all I gotta do

2536.98 --> 2545.619
is not stay up late like an idiot

2541.06 --> 2550.2999999999997
just get to bed early enough so that

2545.619 --> 2552.6400000000003
I'm just fully awake and active

2550.3 --> 2554.8
during my show

2552.64 --> 2558.7799999999997
so that's what I'm gonna try to do

2554.8 --> 2558.78
catch as much sunlight as I can

2560.619 --> 2566.76
by the way I'm still off the D3 and it's

2563.56 --> 2566.7599999999998
still just working fine

2568.599 --> 2572.92
have you been sick lately

2570.78 --> 2576.1600000000003
while sick

2572.92 --> 2578.079
I've had a lot of issues yeah Metal Slug

2576.16 --> 2582.5789999999997
cockatiel

2578.079 --> 2584.92
like in December and January yeah

2582.579 --> 2587.5
but not like sick sick

2584.92 --> 2588.94
it's just like

2587.5 --> 2592.44
well

2588.94 --> 2592.44
and she's with my jaw

2593.26 --> 2599.619
and like

2596.56 --> 2601.96
not being able to handle it like too

2599.619 --> 2605.7000000000003
much stress not being able to let it go

2601.96 --> 2605.7
like those types of things

2605.98 --> 2608.94
mostly

2609.4 --> 2613.54
yeah the ancestral wins like everything

2611.8 --> 2615.819
just becomes harder I literally

2613.54 --> 2618.2799999999997
announced it was gonna happen in

2615.819 --> 2619.359
December I literally announced it like

2618.28 --> 2621.46
big

2619.359 --> 2624.22
even with the freaking title of the show

2621.46 --> 2626.5
like this is going to happen it's not

2624.22 --> 2630.48
just me it's going to be everybody and

2626.5 --> 2630.48
it has it freaking has

2631.0 --> 2634.839
in many ways

2633.52 --> 2637.119
but

2634.839 --> 2639.5789999999997
yeah it's coming out of that

2637.119 --> 2641.38
I really feel I've like gone through

2639.579 --> 2643.119
like every time something annoying

2641.38 --> 2647.8
happens

2643.119 --> 2650.56
it just seems like less of a burden no

2647.8 --> 2653.04
so definitely moving out of that

2650.56 --> 2653.04
part

2654.4 --> 2659.859
and I think that my overall love of

2657.819 --> 2662.079
comprehensibility

2659.859 --> 2667.38
what I'm trying to communicate has also

2662.079 --> 2667.38
been better in the last week maybe two

2671.56 --> 2676.54
when I try to tackle explaining really

2674.26 --> 2679.1800000000003
complicated esoterics

2676.54 --> 2681.099
and psychology effects

2679.18 --> 2683.74
that apply fractively I'm just able to

2681.099 --> 2686.02
do that better right now I watched back

2683.74 --> 2688.839
yesterday's show by the way

2686.02 --> 2691.079
and I really enjoyed it that was a great

2688.839 --> 2691.0789999999997
show

2693.46 --> 2698.619
like I really enjoyed that show watching

2696.4 --> 2700.359
it back and that's like it's kind of

2698.619 --> 2702.28
weird to say that about something that

2700.359 --> 2705.94
you made but I watched it back and I was

2702.28 --> 2709.44
like that's a really good show

2705.94 --> 2709.44
I was so focused

2711.88 --> 2716.5
anyway I hope you guys

2714.339 --> 2720.88
feel that too and that you get something

2716.5 --> 2720.88
out of it inspiration primarily

2722.14 --> 2727.3799999999997
maybe get your creative juices to well

2725.14 --> 2727.3799999999997
up

2728.74 --> 2732.54
that's mostly what I'm doing it for

2734.619 --> 2739.06
anyway

2736.96 --> 2740.38
and being awake is better than being

2739.06 --> 2744.099
woke because

2740.38 --> 2747.06
so quite the opposite right there those

2744.099 --> 2747.06
two words looks like

2748.0 --> 2752.8
like woke is basically another word for

2750.76 --> 2755.7400000000002
willingly ignorant

2752.8 --> 2758.52
it's like militantly willingly ignorant

2755.74 --> 2758.52
that's woke

2760.18 --> 2765.46
being permanently distracted by

2764.02 --> 2768.099
conceptions

2765.46 --> 2770.38
that in reality have very little to do

2768.099 --> 2773.94
with anything but because of your

2770.38 --> 2773.94
enforcement of them

2774.46 --> 2780.339
they become relevant because people need

2777.52 --> 2782.2
to deal with people like you that

2780.339 --> 2784.56
enforce that that's basically what it is

2782.2 --> 2784.56
it's

2785.28 --> 2790.98
militantly reinforced ignorance that's

2788.68 --> 2790.98
woke

2800.38 --> 2804.76
are we still on the black and blue I

2803.26 --> 2808.48
don't know

2804.76 --> 2810.099
but I'm gonna round out the show soon so

2808.48 --> 2812.14
I don't think we're ever going to find

2810.099 --> 2814.619
an answer or at least not from Professor

2812.14 --> 2814.6189999999997
Phil Bell

2816.819 --> 2820.839
well to be fair enough from me either I

2818.98 --> 2822.94
don't know like how do you measure the

2820.839 --> 2824.56
Horizon right

2822.94 --> 2827.14
well you're not going to measure it

2824.56 --> 2830.74
geometrically that's for certain

2827.14 --> 2832.9
so then if you're gonna see something at

2830.74 --> 2835.06
the Horizon that's purely bound to the

2832.9 --> 2837.579
Horizon it's not it's not like something

2835.06 --> 2839.619
you can approach angular size increases

2837.579 --> 2840.76
so that you know it's an object in 3D

2839.619 --> 2843.579
space

2840.76 --> 2845.8
now just something at the Horizon how do

2843.579 --> 2848.2000000000003
you measure that

2845.8 --> 2853.26
you don't

2848.2 --> 2853.2599999999998
you can't estimate an actual distance

2853.3 --> 2857.099
it's at the Horizon it's

2857.92 --> 2863.579
it's not an object anywhere

2861.22 --> 2863.5789999999997
all right

2872.319 --> 2880.0589999999997
wow okay Paul Connell that's

2876.94 --> 2883.38
you'd make me blush a little thank you

2880.059 --> 2883.38
very much I didn't know it was

2883.48 --> 2886.02
oh

2886.66 --> 2891.2799999999997
I didn't know it was that good but thank

2888.88 --> 2892.42
you very much man I appreciate that

2891.28 --> 2894.7000000000003
compliment

2892.42 --> 2896.14
I'm really glad you're

2894.7 --> 2899.3799999999997
you're

2896.14 --> 2901.0589999999997
able to do something good with it

2899.38 --> 2903.3
right that in the end that's the most

2901.059 --> 2903.3
important

2913.0 --> 2915.599
hmm

2916.18 --> 2920.339
infinity and beyond

2931.54 --> 2936.72
it's really funny though that you say

2933.4 --> 2936.7200000000003
that my voice is amazing

2938.92 --> 2946.1800000000003
or is it the way that I use my voice

2942.46 --> 2948.88
because like my voice quality isn't

2946.18 --> 2950.7999999999997
really all that like Supreme like I

2948.88 --> 2953.319
don't have like this magic vocal cord

2950.8 --> 2955.78
thing although I have a lot of vocal

2953.319 --> 2957.88
cord control hey I have great tone

2955.78 --> 2960.46
control also I know that about myself

2957.88 --> 2963.7000000000003
like I'm

2960.46 --> 2967.54
I can like a parrot just like mimic

2963.7 --> 2968.98
complex Melodies like complex Melodies

2967.54 --> 2971.319
perfectly

2968.98 --> 2973.3
I have a good memory for it and I have a

2971.319 --> 2974.619
very good tone like that's a skill that

2973.3 --> 2976.7200000000003
I know it's like I don't need a

2974.619 --> 2978.76
compliment I know I have that I narrated

2976.72 --> 2981.04
it from my mother

2978.76 --> 2983.44
but like our voice quality we don't have

2981.04 --> 2985.839
like me and my mother neither don't

2983.44 --> 2988.54
really have like amazing singing voices

2985.839 --> 2990.099
or anything with it but the way that I

2988.54 --> 2992.319
use my voice

2990.099 --> 2994.7200000000003
like this that you like

2992.319 --> 2997.0
voice control

2994.72 --> 2998.6189999999997
and like back it up with a bit of

2997.0 --> 3002.099
seriousness

2998.619 --> 3004.619
that is very effective I know it is so

3002.099 --> 3007.26
if you're gonna say that that works

3004.619 --> 3010.559
really great for you then I'd say yeah

3007.26 --> 3013.3390000000004
thanks I'm investing actual effort into

3010.559 --> 3017.52
that into improving that too

3013.339 --> 3020.18
communication skills oh God Gadget

3017.52 --> 3020.18
inspector

3022.68 --> 3028.74
I was gonna say I wish I had a girl

3025.68 --> 3032.22
saying that face to face to me

3028.74 --> 3035.9599999999996
that would be even better

3032.22 --> 3035.9599999999996
but that might be the spring talking

3047.7 --> 3053.7
I know how to catch on two things hmm

3053.76 --> 3058.26
well that's not really the void that's

3055.8 --> 3062.94
not voice control though that's

3058.26 --> 3065.579
that's my mind and then I use my voice

3062.94 --> 3067.68
like in conjunction with my mind to give

3065.579 --> 3070.26
like a technical yeah it's complicated

3067.68 --> 3072.839
how it works but to give a proper

3070.26 --> 3075.1400000000003
response fine Taylor

3072.839 --> 3078.2999999999997
tuned response

3075.14 --> 3081.68
utilizing the Dynamics of my voice

3078.3 --> 3081.6800000000003
to really like

3081.72 --> 3087.1189999999997
click with that yeah it's I don't even

3085.2 --> 3091.3999999999996
know properly how to explain that but

3087.119 --> 3091.4
yes I do that and I love doing that

3096.74 --> 3101.819
I only have left yeah yeah that's fine

3099.54 --> 3103.74
gadgets back I knew you were joking

3101.819 --> 3105.72
when you're not raging you have soothing

3103.74 --> 3109.04
intelligent voice right but when I'm

3105.72 --> 3109.04
raging then I become

3109.38 --> 3113.819
different

3111.119 --> 3116.28
man I've watched yesterday's fed back

3113.819 --> 3119.04
I'm gonna run out the shows but

3116.28 --> 3122.0400000000004
it's not from yesterday's fed but there

3119.04 --> 3125.339
was a Premiere from the 1600 and Nathan

3122.04 --> 3127.579
left that whole freaking part in what an

3125.339 --> 3127.5789999999997
ass

3129.0 --> 3134.7
but I did sound really annoying but

3131.28 --> 3138.1800000000003
Jesus Christ guys like the panelists

3134.7 --> 3140.64
were just all poo-pooing me all of them

3138.18 --> 3142.3799999999997
none of them were taking it serious like

3140.64 --> 3147.0589999999997
that I was like

3142.38 --> 3148.98
I like felt like Dishonored

3147.059 --> 3151.6400000000003
by what they were doing

3148.98 --> 3155.4
and they and all of them were just

3151.64 --> 3157.319
and I'm like dude

3155.4 --> 3159.96
like

3157.319 --> 3161.52
don't do that face to face with me if

3159.96 --> 3162.9
like I'm in a group somewhere where I

3161.52 --> 3165.119
have a conversation and they're all

3162.9 --> 3167.2200000000003
going to be like god dude you could have

3165.119 --> 3169.2000000000003
me literally just smack you in the face

3167.22 --> 3171.839
even though I consider you my best

3169.2 --> 3175.859
friend if you do that to me

3171.839 --> 3177.96
not hard but like that really pisses me

3175.859 --> 3181.2
off if I have like a

3177.96 --> 3184.859
an actual real grievance and then

3181.2 --> 3184.859
everybody's like that's

3184.92 --> 3189.78
that's pretty serious

3187.559 --> 3192.8390000000004
and I'm like it's a bit shocked that

3189.78 --> 3194.94
they don't recognize that right I try to

3192.839 --> 3199.04
explain it in detail and they all just

3194.94 --> 3199.04
kept poo pooing it all of them

3200.579 --> 3205.02
that was really annoying

3203.64 --> 3207.1189999999997
and I

3205.02 --> 3208.92
it hurt and I think everybody could hear

3207.119 --> 3211.02
that in my voice

3208.92 --> 3213.96
I didn't have strength as I was doing

3211.02 --> 3217.2
that because it really hurt

3213.96 --> 3220.619
and I felt weakened by just

3217.2 --> 3224.16
like sort of a it on the Fly vote of no

3220.619 --> 3226.079
confidence that I did not deserve

3224.16 --> 3228.48
that's what happened during that episode

3226.079 --> 3230.579
1600.

3228.48 --> 3233.4
yes what show was that that was

3230.579 --> 3236.4
yesterday's Premiere yesterday night

3233.4 --> 3236.4
1600.

3237.42 --> 3241.14
and it was like pretty much in the early

3239.64 --> 3242.64
after show

3241.14 --> 3244.02
and the rest of the after show was

3242.64 --> 3245.8799999999997
pretty good

3244.02 --> 3247.319
I guess everybody was kind of in a weird

3245.88 --> 3249.599
goofy mood

3247.319 --> 3252.72
but like at some point I was just like

3249.599 --> 3256.7400000000002
gonna bring in the silly story about

3252.72 --> 3258.48
like glass marbles on the moon according

3256.74 --> 3261.859
to China

3258.48 --> 3264.839
and tenth man was just like literally

3261.859 --> 3268.0989999999997
ruining it for me he literally started

3264.839 --> 3271.38
rumpusing over me and he would not stop

3268.099 --> 3272.52
why because he didn't want to hear about

3271.38 --> 3275.1600000000003
it

3272.52 --> 3278.4
it's like the rudest freaking thing ever

3275.16 --> 3280.5589999999997
and others even agreed with it but it I

3278.4 --> 3282.7200000000003
was physically in pain at that moment I

3280.559 --> 3285.119
confessed that

3282.72 --> 3287.16
that I could not handle him I I had to

3285.119 --> 3289.799
basically say just like shut the [ __ ] up

3287.16 --> 3291.42
old man like I got really [ __ ] pissed

3289.799 --> 3293.46
off it's not the first time he's done

3291.42 --> 3296.4
something like that

3293.46 --> 3299.579
and it's it's always him it's not the

3296.4 --> 3303.96
other guys him doing that and everybody

3299.579 --> 3307.559
just lets him do that

3303.96 --> 3310.799
nobody's like hey tenth man come on come

3307.559 --> 3313.38
on just let it go nobody is saying that

3310.799 --> 3315.42
to him in that moment right they're all

3313.38 --> 3319.559
just saying no or when you let it go

3315.42 --> 3322.26
what I let it go being hurt for being

3319.559 --> 3325.799
bullied like rumpus

3322.26 --> 3329.579
oh for just bringing up something

3325.799 --> 3332.46
like it was all wrong everything was

3329.579 --> 3335.099
wrong about it I and I needed to address

3332.46 --> 3337.64
that for a second I was really pissed

3335.099 --> 3337.6400000000003
off by that

3337.68 --> 3342.5989999999997
then I kind of recovered because just

3339.96 --> 3344.76
like nobody was responding to it

3342.599 --> 3347.46
but those are like things in my past

3344.76 --> 3349.7990000000004
that happened too like at school that

3347.46 --> 3353.7
that kind of psychologically turned me

3349.799 --> 3353.7
into a monster partially

3354.18 --> 3357.96
because it's so unjustified everything

3356.76 --> 3360.6600000000003
about it

3357.96 --> 3362.579
carelessness

3360.66 --> 3364.859
about it

3362.579 --> 3369.0
and it yeah

3364.859 --> 3371.88
I get psychological allergic responses

3369.0 --> 3374.66
to that I really do

3371.88 --> 3377.52
and I kind of do have the same effect

3374.66 --> 3379.8799999999997
when I see others do that to other

3377.52 --> 3379.88
people

3382.92 --> 3388.92
Pue is vile no it wasn't QE it's the

3386.16 --> 3390.839
image it wasn't QE he wasn't doing

3388.92 --> 3394.52
anything

3390.839 --> 3394.52
it was freaking 10th Man

3394.98 --> 3400.319
and then the rest of the guys were just

3397.26 --> 3402.7200000000003
like oh come on or when oh go shut the

3400.319 --> 3405.0
[ __ ] up dude

3402.72 --> 3409.0789999999997
