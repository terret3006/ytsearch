189.28 --> 194.0
like facial

191.04 --> 195.35999999999999
maneuvering training again

194.0 --> 198.0
because it's just

195.36 --> 200.48000000000002
i'm kind of used to like not using it

198.0 --> 203.36
because of the inflammation situation in

200.48 --> 203.35999999999999
the past week

211.76 --> 216.0
something you gotta train right the

213.76 --> 218.48

216.0 --> 221.12
use well i speak

218.48 --> 225.11999999999998
and i do facial expressions i have to

221.12 --> 227.519
train these muscles constantly

225.12 --> 229.76
keep them all stretched and

227.519 --> 229.76000000000002
yeah

229.92 --> 232.319
anyway

234.08 --> 237.59900000000002
hello mike sedunich first in chat

236.4 --> 239.04
crockett

237.599 --> 241.35999999999999
m

239.04 --> 245.12
borders boy

241.36 --> 245.12
bjc net good to see you all

245.68 --> 249.92000000000002
it is tuesday

247.599 --> 252.92
the 19th of april

249.92 --> 252.92
2022

270.32 --> 276.759
strange show came up in your

272.32 --> 276.759
recommendations okay

282.88 --> 285.84
well

283.919 --> 289.28
recommendations is like what you get to

285.84 --> 289.28
see on the sidebar right

290.0 --> 293.32
well yeah

296.72 --> 301.52000000000004
so yeah youtube has been kind of trying

299.199 --> 304.16
to forward new things that it doesn't

301.52 --> 305.52
typically show in lists to me

304.16 --> 308.56
as well

305.52 --> 309.44
it's very perceptive of you right

308.56 --> 311.84
it's

309.44 --> 314.0
easter time

311.84 --> 316.63899999999995
right it's when everybody's the most

314.0 --> 319.199
prone to seductions and suggestions so

316.639 --> 319.199
guess what

319.52 --> 324.88
any agenda out there any system that

322.479 --> 327.199
engages in manipulation

324.88 --> 328.96
of people to accomplish something

327.199 --> 331.96000000000004
they're gonna make moves

328.96 --> 331.96
right

339.68 --> 344.12
so yeah it is the time for the rollout

342.32 --> 347.52
of new

344.12 --> 347.52
advertisements right

349.68 --> 354.56
and all that and yeah suggestions if

352.72 --> 356.0
they have suggestions for you or like oh

354.56 --> 357.84
go this way

356.0 --> 360.8
because now you'll actually be more

357.84 --> 361.75899999999996
inclined to like wander off

360.8 --> 364.8
right

361.759 --> 368.36
i mean if youtube could

364.8 --> 370.88
get a grasp on people like us

368.36 --> 373.12
conspiracy theories

370.88 --> 376.4
then they literally just keep showing

373.12 --> 378.319
you videos from one to another until

376.4 --> 380.15999999999997
you're basically watching nothing but

378.319 --> 382.56
cat videos

380.16 --> 386.24
right if youtube through their

382.56 --> 389.36
suggestion system could make you forget

386.24 --> 390.24
that you were ever involved in anything

389.36 --> 392.47900000000004
else

390.24 --> 395.84000000000003
then it would and with some people that

392.479 --> 395.84
actually works

396.24 --> 402.96000000000004
but yeah those are the very suggestible

399.44 --> 402.96
people and little kids

403.12 --> 407.96
right

403.919 --> 407.96
hello slo-mo moon buggy

408.479 --> 411.96
globe asunder

422.479 --> 426.96
what's presented by youtube is garbage

433.68 --> 437.599
right wait

434.8 --> 439.84000000000003
when you don't attune it

437.599 --> 442.24
you mean right

439.84 --> 444.71999999999997
when you don't basically let them know

442.24 --> 447.599
like it's you so they adapt but you get

444.72 --> 448.56
to see to your profile

447.599 --> 449.84
yeah

448.56 --> 452.0
their

449.84 --> 454.63899999999995
stance you got to realize it's almost

452.0 --> 456.4
like their government face

454.639 --> 459.759
it's going to be terrible

456.4 --> 462.63899999999995
it's going to be a terrible

459.759 --> 462.639
cookie cutter

463.199 --> 467.28000000000003
pc

464.879 --> 467.28000000000003
crap

467.36 --> 471.28000000000003
right no this is

468.96 --> 473.12
supposedly or alleged what do you call

471.28 --> 474.79999999999995
it judicially non-threatening as

473.12 --> 478.12
possible

474.8 --> 478.12
if they could

478.16 --> 482.96000000000004
in the current environment

480.56 --> 486.28000000000003
it's it's yeah

482.96 --> 486.28
i get it

498.16 --> 502.24
nothing longer than 15 minutes really

500.16 --> 504.16
short videos

502.24 --> 507.84000000000003
okay

504.16 --> 507.84000000000003
hello flip flat

521.839 --> 527.36
yeah how are you guys all doing it's a

523.919 --> 530.36
lot of people in my chat for so quick

527.36 --> 530.36
huh

538.0 --> 543.36
i actually started on time today

541.36 --> 546.76
on the second

543.36 --> 546.76
that's new

552.72 --> 558.9590000000001
yeah by the way like how is my sound man

555.36 --> 561.279
i was listening back to yesterday's show

558.959 --> 562.959
right before this one and yeah it was

561.279 --> 565.76
pretty good

562.959 --> 568.64
got through the first half hour

565.76 --> 570.0
but man there's like this buzz sound

568.64 --> 572.3199999999999
going through it and it's really

570.0 --> 574.839
annoying

572.32 --> 577.36
i guess it's my

574.839 --> 579.44
computer uh

577.36 --> 581.6
i think it might be time to

579.44 --> 583.36
go and attempt to

581.6 --> 585.519
put like that

583.36 --> 587.92
soundless radiator

585.519 --> 590.32
onto it

587.92 --> 593.36
because it's just the noise is really

590.32 --> 593.36
getting on my nerves

593.519 --> 598.399
like now that i'm hearing it back

595.92 --> 600.56
like if i'm already teaching myself to

598.399 --> 602.8
put it out of my mind

600.56 --> 602.8
but

603.839 --> 609.36
anyway how's my jaw today

606.56 --> 609.3599999999999
yeah pretty good

609.6 --> 615.44
but again yeah uh

612.48 --> 616.9590000000001
it's all it's got it's grown a bit stiff

615.44 --> 621.0400000000001
and i'm like

616.959 --> 624.959
not really used to using it anymore

621.04 --> 627.519
because i just kept it still for so long

624.959 --> 629.279
so i have to really like kind of

627.519 --> 630.72
rehabilitate

629.279 --> 633.4399999999999
it

630.72 --> 636.44
through some facial

633.44 --> 636.44
exercises

657.76 --> 661.8389999999999
but yeah i seem to be okay

667.76 --> 671.92
what is a bit weird though

670.079 --> 674.88
is that

671.92 --> 676.56
i have like this very slight weird

674.88 --> 678.88
numbing

676.56 --> 681.1199999999999
headache feeling but it's like very

678.88 --> 683.4399999999999
slight and it's kind of like

681.12 --> 686.16
here

683.44 --> 689.48
i think actually that's from the

686.16 --> 689.48
from the anesthesia

691.2 --> 694.1600000000001
i mean yeah

695.76 --> 701.4399999999999
like i yeah that's not

698.88 --> 704.48
there's probably components to that i

701.44 --> 707.839
mean my ex even like as a dentist went

704.48 --> 710.0
into biodentistry because of that

707.839 --> 712.48
because a lot of it like have weird side

710.0 --> 712.48
effects

713.04 --> 717.12
and can like even make your nerves go

715.92 --> 718.7199999999999
crazy

717.12 --> 722.24
and i really hope that that didn't

718.72 --> 725.2
happen and if it did that it'll go away

722.24 --> 725.2
because otherwise

725.6 --> 727.76
yeah

726.72 --> 729.6800000000001
now it

727.76 --> 731.92
surely it must be able to you must be

729.68 --> 734.3199999999999
able to get rid of that

731.92 --> 736.56
but yeah i'm gonna think twice before

734.32 --> 739.5600000000001
doing that for such a simple little

736.56 --> 739.56
procedure

755.44 --> 758.44
anyway

760.56 --> 766.56
yeah i'm eating pretty well again

764.399 --> 769.2
and uh

766.56 --> 771.8389999999999
yeah also like just my hunger is kind of

769.2 --> 774.32
back to normal

771.839 --> 776.8800000000001
not soup the weird thing is i felt

774.32 --> 778.8000000000001
hungry but i couldn't eat much

776.88 --> 781.279
now it's just like

778.8 --> 783.12
the hungers finally died down

781.279 --> 783.92
back to kind of more

783.12 --> 785.519
like

783.92 --> 787.76
enthusiasm

785.519 --> 789.68
levels weirdly enough

787.76 --> 793.04
like but that's the thing

789.68 --> 793.04
i now feel like this

793.12 --> 798.48
just this joyous enthusiasm a lot

797.2 --> 801.2
but still

798.48 --> 803.519
reserved

801.2 --> 805.9200000000001
it's just really unpleasant

803.519 --> 805.92
feeling

809.12 --> 812.48
hello

810.24 --> 816.16
where did everybody go is it your three

812.48 --> 817.94
minutes of silence again for my chat

816.16 --> 821.069
what the hell

817.94 --> 821.0690000000001
[Music]

829.76 --> 834.16
try to isolate your microphone from the

832.0 --> 838.15
vibration well

834.16 --> 840.399
i could try the toilet roll trick again

838.15 --> 844.959
[Music]

840.399 --> 844.959
maybe that'll work it looks silly though

845.76 --> 849.639
right so how is that

864.0 --> 869.04
same with the buzz yeah i think it's

866.16 --> 871.8389999999999
just coming straight from my computer

869.04 --> 875.4399999999999
it's it's annoying

871.839 --> 875.44
the problem is also that

875.6 --> 878.639
just the way this

878.8 --> 884.639
this desk is built

881.6 --> 888.0
i can't just fit my computer under my

884.639 --> 890.399
table to get rid of the noise

888.0 --> 893.12
which is kind of a bummer

890.399 --> 893.12
at this point

896.639 --> 899.639
right

904.8 --> 910.0
is there

906.0 --> 910.0
is there absolutely no difference or

911.12 --> 918.079
ambient fan noise right yeah it yeah

914.8 --> 921.519
then it's not from the vibrations

918.079 --> 926.519
then it's most certainly

921.519 --> 926.519
just from my computer i'm sorry guys

927.519 --> 929.839
hmm

935.04 --> 939.3199999999999
let's see what could i do

952.959 --> 955.8389999999999
great

966.88 --> 975.16
if should just put this in between there

971.279 --> 975.16
maybe that'll help some

975.72 --> 979.21
[Music]

982.72 --> 986.6
is that helping any

1003.44 --> 1006.44
okay

1016.24 --> 1019.379
[Music]

1024.959 --> 1027.28
um

1028.64 --> 1031.199
yeah again

1034.319 --> 1038.799
i'm not gonna mess with that too much

1036.98 --> 1041.919
[Music]

1038.799 --> 1044.319
i it could just be that i'm just my

1041.919 --> 1046.88
voice i'm not really using my voice all

1044.319 --> 1046.8799999999999
that much

1049.52 --> 1053.559
let's tinker with it a bit

1063.12 --> 1066.36
all right

1066.559 --> 1068.8799999999999
so

1069.76 --> 1072.559
how is it now

1072.96 --> 1078.6000000000001
no difference

1075.6 --> 1078.6
great

1080.4 --> 1088.18
[Music]

1092.88 --> 1097.7600000000002

1117.28 --> 1121.799
off asleep but listening okay

1122.24 --> 1125.24
hmm

1169.679 --> 1174.48
all right

1171.76 --> 1177.96
another thing to put on my list

1174.48 --> 1177.96
i haven't even

1178.0 --> 1182.72
yeah i don't even have a list yet but

1181.84 --> 1185.36
i

1182.72 --> 1188.32
have to put the fan back on

1185.36 --> 1188.32
on my computer

1188.4 --> 1191.4
um

1201.2 --> 1205.2

what's going down

1205.2 --> 1207.8400000000001
seems to be a little

1209.6 --> 1216.6789999999999
sleepy or something

1255.84 --> 1259.6
maybe if there's just this energy

1257.76 --> 1262.32
hanging here

1259.6 --> 1264.7199999999998
those flowery trees and sun like yeah

1262.32 --> 1267.28
just hanging in the park somewhere

1264.72 --> 1269.039
picnicking and just chilling

1267.28 --> 1272.48
it's really that type of weather and

1269.039 --> 1272.48
it's rubbing off on me i

1274.84 --> 1279.6
think it's good that i just said that

1278.08 --> 1283.72
because it seems to

1279.6 --> 1283.7199999999998
like woken me up

1297.49 --> 1300.569
[Music]

1313.28 --> 1316.28

1374.64 --> 1380.4
no it's not windows 10

1376.799 --> 1380.4
pdac net sorry

1386.559 --> 1390.72
maybe there is a noise filter though

1401.12 --> 1404.799
how did i find those again

1406.72 --> 1410.039
oh dear

1419.76 --> 1425.44
totally forgot how that worked

1422.799 --> 1426.6399999999999
i didn't get a noise filter

1425.44 --> 1428.64
there was

1426.64 --> 1431.8400000000001
something i could do

1428.64 --> 1431.8400000000001
in obs

1431.919 --> 1436.2
how the hell did i do that

1444.4 --> 1450.76
i'm gonna have to ask adam meeking i

1446.4 --> 1450.76
forgot how to do that [ __ ]

1470.24 --> 1473.559
oh wait

1475.12 --> 1481.1589999999999
filters

1476.88 --> 1481.159
ah yeah i found it

1487.2 --> 1492.0
there is something called noise

1488.96 --> 1495.039
suppression there

1492.0 --> 1495.039
i could try it out

1496.48 --> 1501.279
but it could like totally disrupt the

1498.96 --> 1504.559
noise as well or do you like the sound

1501.279 --> 1504.559
i'll i'll try it out

1504.88 --> 1509.2
okay

1506.96 --> 1509.2
oh

1509.6 --> 1514.3999999999999
all right well

1511.36 --> 1517.6
it looks

1514.4 --> 1520.6000000000001
like it does go down to absolute zero

1517.6 --> 1520.6
now

1536.72 --> 1543.2
all right but like how's my actual sound

1539.679 --> 1545.919
quality for my voice

1543.2 --> 1547.6000000000001
does it screw it over is it like sudden

1545.919 --> 1550.0800000000002
deafness

1547.6 --> 1552.32
in between each cent in in between each

1550.08 --> 1555.32
pause because that is pretty freaky as

1552.32 --> 1555.32
well

1562.08 --> 1566.559
wow you're getting none of that

1563.679 --> 1566.5590000000002
background noise

1568.72 --> 1572.159
because i sure am

1573.44 --> 1578.559
oh god there's like a

1575.36 --> 1581.559
a grass mower machine there right now

1578.559 --> 1581.559
yeah

1583.08 --> 1586.1999999999998
[Music]

1592.799 --> 1598.6
wow it it is still very sensitive though

1595.6 --> 1598.6
so

1599.52 --> 1603.039
huh

1600.4 --> 1604.4
okay i'll i'll try this out

1603.039 --> 1606.559
for a while

1604.4 --> 1608.64
for today and then listen back like what

1606.559 --> 1611.6399999999999
is that like maybe this is a really good

1608.64 --> 1611.64
option

1646.72 --> 1652.0
by the way like can you still hear like

1649.52 --> 1654.8799999999999
a weird buzz sound through when i'm

1652.0 --> 1655.76
talking like if i keep on making sound

1654.88 --> 1657.7600000000002
and

1655.76 --> 1660.399
can you still hear the buzz coming

1657.76 --> 1662.48
through when i still talk or is it just

1660.399 --> 1665.8799999999999
completely gone now for some reason how

1662.48 --> 1665.88
does that work

1673.84 --> 1677.1999999999998
it's clear

1675.36 --> 1679.52
wow

1677.2 --> 1681.6000000000001
damn dude why didn't i ever try this

1679.52 --> 1684.8799999999999
before it's

1681.6 --> 1686.8799999999999
gone for three years and

1684.88 --> 1690.7600000000002
that option was probably

1686.88 --> 1690.7600000000002
always there okay

1700.799 --> 1705.1589999999999
was killed woohoo

1731.2 --> 1734.2
cool

1738.64 --> 1743.279
all right

1739.6 --> 1747.279
let's see how much filter that was

1743.279 --> 1747.279
yeah there's noise suppression

1750.799 --> 1754.96
it's interesting

1752.399 --> 1756.9599999999998
oh wow they have like a speedy option

1754.96 --> 1759.2
and a cpus

1756.96 --> 1760.96
cpu option so this is like really a

1759.2 --> 1762.559
rendered thing

1760.96 --> 1765.039
so you're basically really getting in

1762.559 --> 1765.039
digital

1765.279 --> 1769.679
output of my voice

1767.84 --> 1771.84
oh dear

1769.679 --> 1774.159
i wonder if i can like hear the

1771.84 --> 1777.039
difference

1774.159 --> 1778.64
this is interesting

1777.039 --> 1781.2
now can also

1778.64 --> 1783.679
i'm going to attempt to put my volume

1781.2 --> 1783.679
higher

1787.2 --> 1790.159
will it be better

1792.159 --> 1795.159
higher

1802.799 --> 1807.52
yo

1804.48 --> 1807.52
so how's this

1807.679 --> 1810.72
how does this work

1811.52 --> 1816.1589999999999
is there a way you can pm me what

1815.279 --> 1818.559
uh

1816.159 --> 1821.88
well through skype

1818.559 --> 1821.8799999999999
right back

1825.6 --> 1830.4399999999998
or you could email me if you want

1847.76 --> 1853.279
sounds still good and like the volume

1857.76 --> 1862.8799999999999
like yeah i don't know if like if i get

1859.84 --> 1862.8799999999999
really loud

1863.36 --> 1868.399
oh wow it doesn't even like go full red

1866.0 --> 1870.72
blast now

1868.399 --> 1870.7199999999998
damn

1870.88 --> 1874.6000000000001
this is pretty epic

1878.559 --> 1884.1589999999999
cool

1880.24 --> 1884.159
well let's see how this works out

1886.799 --> 1891.96
and now let's have something to talk

1888.96 --> 1891.96
about

1897.84 --> 1904.1999999999998
or i can eat a croissant and you can

1900.0 --> 1904.2
listen like how that sounds

1906.72 --> 1910.2
i'm kind of hungry

1923.2 --> 1928.919
wow

1924.08 --> 1928.9189999999999
the mic is barely even picking that up

1982.64 --> 1987.919
hey man on the edge

1984.96 --> 1991.44
if you dragged fight to flat earth up

1987.919 --> 1992.88
to 50 000 feet

1991.44 --> 1994.3200000000002
showed him the earth is flattened on

1992.88 --> 1997.679
rotating

1994.32 --> 1997.6789999999999
would he accept it no

1998.799 --> 2003.2
because

1999.76 --> 2006.08
he would still be able to imagine

2003.2 --> 2008.799
how it's actually all bent down into a

2006.08 --> 2010.799
sphere underneath his feet dingleberry

2008.799 --> 2012.24
right you can't take the dingleberry

2010.799 --> 2013.6
from a man

2012.24 --> 2018.08
by force

2013.6 --> 2021.279
you can only put it down

2018.08 --> 2021.279
put that cookie down

2021.36 --> 2024.1589999999999
that's what it is

2028.799 --> 2034.8799999999999
right as long as he can imagine it

2032.159 --> 2035.8400000000001
you'll keep saying it's a sphere it's

2034.88 --> 2037.44
like

2035.84 --> 2039.36
you're standing on something flat and

2037.44 --> 2043.6000000000001
you'll just keep saying it's a sphere

2039.36 --> 2043.6
it's a sphere it's not gonna let it go

2044.559 --> 2048.88
now 500 000 it's still the same

2056.24 --> 2058.879
right

2057.04 --> 2060.399
i mean we're talking about the guy that

2058.879 --> 2062.7999999999997
said

2060.399 --> 2065.839
like look at your hand you think it's

2062.8 --> 2067.76
really there no it isn't

2065.839 --> 2071.399
right you realize we're talking about

2067.76 --> 2071.3990000000003
that guy right

2121.599 --> 2125.92
hmm

2123.359 --> 2129.04
asic and star wars

2125.92 --> 2131.839
yeah yeah men on the edge

2129.04 --> 2131.839
the thing is

2132.4 --> 2137.44
if you wouldn't tell them at what height

2135.04 --> 2139.839
you were let's just say you could

2137.44 --> 2142.7200000000003
theoretically it's not really possible

2139.839 --> 2145.68
we don't really have the technology

2142.72 --> 2148.64
i think or they lost it it's too painful

2145.68 --> 2150.64
to put it back together it's just

2148.64 --> 2152.0789999999997
that's a joke

2150.64 --> 2154.4
all right let's just say there is some

2152.079 --> 2156.8390000000004
way to actually go up incredibly high

2154.4 --> 2158.64
it's still going to be contained

2156.839 --> 2163.119
right like

2158.64 --> 2163.1189999999997
otherwise it just gets really weird

2163.28 --> 2166.88
there has to be a limited volume but

2164.88 --> 2167.839
let's just say you could go up

2166.88 --> 2170.96
six

2167.839 --> 2174.16
million miles

2170.96 --> 2176.88
i know ridiculous idea right

2174.16 --> 2179.359
let's just say it's almost like a a tube

2176.88 --> 2183.52
i'm i'm literally now falling back into

2179.359 --> 2185.52
an old idea from my very first show ever

2183.52 --> 2188.24
it was in there it was a rectangular

2185.52 --> 2189.7599999999998
looping and it's like a like this giant

2188.24 --> 2193.1189999999997
tube

2189.76 --> 2195.76
and throughout eternity

2193.119 --> 2199.32
everything's just kind of digging down

2195.76 --> 2199.32
through this tube

2201.68 --> 2205.52
right

2203.119 --> 2205.52
weird

2206.16 --> 2209.92
but let's just say you could go up that

2208.24 --> 2212.24
high

2209.92 --> 2212.2400000000002
how

2212.32 --> 2216.8
not literally going there but you would

2214.64 --> 2219.2
take fight the flat earth up in some

2216.8 --> 2223.119
balloon or system thing that can just

2219.2 --> 2225.359
steadily float at any of these heights

2223.119 --> 2226.2400000000002
and you'd show him

2225.359 --> 2228.96
like

2226.24 --> 2230.16
at a million feet

2228.96 --> 2232.0
height

2230.16 --> 2234.3199999999997
and then tell him that you're actually

2232.0 --> 2237.28
at 50 000.

2234.32 --> 2237.28
he would tell you

2237.599 --> 2244.2400000000002
oh just go up to like 500 000 feet and

2242.16 --> 2246.0
then you'll see it

2244.24 --> 2247.9199999999996
and then you can tell him like yeah but

2246.0 --> 2249.04
we're actually at a million right

2247.92 --> 2252.96
because

2249.04 --> 2256.16
it always looks exactly as flat

2252.96 --> 2258.32
and after like certain extremities of

2256.16 --> 2259.359
distance

2258.32 --> 2261.76
like

2259.359 --> 2263.52
there's not much visual difference you

2261.76 --> 2265.76
even get to see

2263.52 --> 2265.7599999999998
like

2266.48 --> 2271.52
it's just this much further away when

2269.04 --> 2272.96
it's like half a million

2271.52 --> 2274.8
further

2272.96 --> 2276.7200000000003
right visually it becomes also

2274.8 --> 2278.079
incredibly

2276.72 --> 2280.9599999999996
distant

2278.079 --> 2284.079
but that horizon will still seem exactly

2280.96 --> 2287.76
like the same horizon at the same height

2284.079 --> 2291.04
like it's just never going to go away

2287.76 --> 2293.6800000000003
i think that's what's going to happen

2291.04 --> 2296.64
that that is what would happen

2293.68 --> 2299.839
the horizon just never goes away

2296.64 --> 2299.839
always there

2314.64 --> 2318.64
you can't get a 90 degree on the ball

2322.96 --> 2327.0
email sent all right

2350.72 --> 2355.839
all right thank you for for that

2352.64 --> 2355.839
information rig back

2357.52 --> 2361.839
i mean

2359.68 --> 2365.44
i wouldn't mind if you just told people

2361.839 --> 2365.44
in public but yeah

2365.52 --> 2368.52
whatever

2370.48 --> 2374.32
okay

2371.68 --> 2376.3199999999997
and for the record rig back like he's

2374.32 --> 2377.3590000000004
not the only one

2376.32 --> 2380.839
there's

2377.359 --> 2380.839
a lot of people

2383.599 --> 2387.76
that have followed my show at one point

2385.52 --> 2390.56
we haven't had even had

2387.76 --> 2392.96
one-on-one communications and all that

2390.56 --> 2395.599
and a lot of them

2392.96 --> 2397.359
now think that like they're my enemy or

2395.599 --> 2400.2400000000002
my gatekeeper or something like they

2397.359 --> 2400.24
really hate me

2402.32 --> 2406.1600000000003
and i try to

2403.839 --> 2407.92
deal with them civilly

2406.16 --> 2409.839
right

2407.92 --> 2413.2000000000003
but they hold on to like this weird

2409.839 --> 2413.2
grudge thing or whatever

2414.64 --> 2418.7999999999997
and so yeah

2416.72 --> 2420.56
there's a lot of places out there now i

2418.8 --> 2422.6400000000003
come there and then there's like these

2420.56 --> 2424.88
people that are like oh here's are we

2422.64 --> 2426.96
now we freaking hate you you're a stupid

2424.88 --> 2430.88
bastard

2426.96 --> 2432.7200000000003
or you're psycho or whatever or evil or

2430.88 --> 2436.56
whatever they can come up with however

2432.72 --> 2436.56
far they typically like to let it go

2437.52 --> 2443.04
some of them

2440.079 --> 2444.96
hopefully due to my teachings still have

2443.04 --> 2448.56
some common decency

2444.96 --> 2452.92
so they don't really do that but yeah

2448.56 --> 2452.92
i've heard a lot of people's feelings

2454.16 --> 2456.0
right

2455.04 --> 2458.0
it's

2456.0 --> 2462.56
it's a hazard it's

2458.0 --> 2465.599
like i have to confront i have to do it

2462.56 --> 2467.04
like i can never not do that again you

2465.599 --> 2468.7200000000003
see

2467.04 --> 2471.599
the past

2468.72 --> 2473.04
not confronting something like that bad

2471.599 --> 2474.88
behavior

2473.04 --> 2476.88
has led me into

2474.88 --> 2480.839
monstrously

2476.88 --> 2480.839
nightmarish situations

2481.28 --> 2485.8390000000004
i have to confront it even if that means

2484.48 --> 2488.2400000000002
somebody then

2485.839 --> 2490.72
potentially hates me forever after that

2488.24 --> 2492.64
point i just have to do it i have to do

2490.72 --> 2494.9599999999996
it i will do it

2492.64 --> 2496.16
be warned

2494.96 --> 2498.7200000000003
i will

2496.16 --> 2498.72
do that

2499.359 --> 2503.359
if you push it

2501.68 --> 2506.0
i will not

2503.359 --> 2506.0
step down

2506.64 --> 2512.2
i might walk away

2508.4 --> 2512.2000000000003
will not yield

2525.04 --> 2532.44
some people like to go to me what

2529.04 --> 2532.44
even goat

2540.72 --> 2543.7599999999998
all right yeah

2545.68 --> 2548.0789999999997
i know

2549.76 --> 2553.92
but i mean it's basically my own fault

2552.079 --> 2555.28
right because i

2553.92 --> 2558.56
have

2555.28 --> 2558.5600000000004
opened up that can

2560.16 --> 2562.48
right

2563.319 --> 2568.16
unapologetically at the first at the

2565.92 --> 2568.96
start it was basically like an accident

2568.16 --> 2571.2799999999997
and i

2568.96 --> 2573.28
would be apologetic about it then i just

2571.28 --> 2577.3590000000004
realized like yeah i can't actually

2573.28 --> 2579.0400000000004
prevent opening up that can periodically

2577.359 --> 2581.119
and i'm just not going to apologize

2579.04 --> 2583.2
anymore for something that

2581.119 --> 2585.92
seems to be kind of like

2583.2 --> 2585.9199999999996
necessary

2589.52 --> 2593.52
even though in the general public it

2591.599 --> 2597.2000000000003
seems to be seems to have been

2593.52 --> 2599.68
completely conditioned out

2597.2 --> 2603.0789999999997
of dealing with that that format of

2599.68 --> 2603.0789999999997
doing things

2607.2 --> 2611.359
yeah confrontational now when you get

2609.76 --> 2614.7200000000003
confrontational people get

2611.359 --> 2616.48
confrontational with you and guess what

2614.72 --> 2618.319
i kind of like that

2616.48 --> 2621.599
i don't like it

2618.319 --> 2623.839
i don't really like it but i i like the

2621.599 --> 2624.6400000000003
challenge

2623.839 --> 2628.0
so

2624.64 --> 2631.04
it was always going to be unavoidable

2628.0 --> 2633.2
so if i can't avoid it why let it be my

2631.04 --> 2635.839
curse if i could actually benefit from

2633.2 --> 2638.72
it

2635.839 --> 2638.72
so that's what i do

2640.4 --> 2643.92
right

2642.48 --> 2646.8
like confront me

2643.92 --> 2646.8
tell me right

2646.96 --> 2651.119
it's better to have trolls around you

2649.119 --> 2652.48
actually poke trying to poke at your

2651.119 --> 2655.359
weaknesses

2652.48 --> 2657.92
honestly to really get to you

2655.359 --> 2660.72
then all the friends in the world that

2657.92 --> 2662.88
are just always smiley face and just

2660.72 --> 2665.359
too afraid to

2662.88 --> 2667.359
to tell you something that's actually

2665.359 --> 2670.64
kind of wrong or whatever

2667.359 --> 2673.2
because of weird mystical reasons

2670.64 --> 2674.839
you know and then like whatever you have

2673.2 --> 2677.2
you're like you don't have a mirror

2674.839 --> 2679.04
anymore because people aren't honest

2677.2 --> 2681.2799999999997
with you they aren't actually pointing

2679.04 --> 2684.92
out like hey this that

2681.28 --> 2684.92
for whatever reason

2693.52 --> 2697.119
right so

2695.2 --> 2699.2799999999997
the way i see it a lot of people out

2697.119 --> 2701.52
there they don't follow my show anymore

2699.28 --> 2703.52
they think they hate me

2701.52 --> 2705.839
but they're just kind of

2703.52 --> 2705.839
more like

2706.24 --> 2708.72
friends

2710.0 --> 2714.16
that just like can't handle it

2714.319 --> 2719.119
but i basically treat them like friends

2716.96 --> 2721.119
with like heartbroken friends or

2719.119 --> 2722.96
something or people that are just like

2721.119 --> 2726.2400000000002
the

2722.96 --> 2729.599
retracted have issues

2726.24 --> 2729.5989999999997
just let them sort it out

2730.079 --> 2734.079
but i don't hate them because they do

2732.319 --> 2737.359
that

2734.079 --> 2737.3590000000004
we've gone through things

2737.52 --> 2740.56
they've showed

2739.2 --> 2741.839
goodwill

2740.56 --> 2744.0789999999997
quality

2741.839 --> 2746.0789999999997
focus good traits

2744.079 --> 2748.88
from their side right otherwise i

2746.079 --> 2750.8
wouldn't have even been able to

2748.88 --> 2754.48
become interested

2750.8 --> 2757.04
people that have none of those qualities

2754.48 --> 2759.52
i just don't even i

2757.04 --> 2761.52
i just ignore them like not even hot

2759.52 --> 2763.44
with hostile intent or anything i don't

2761.52 --> 2767.16
avoid them i just like

2763.44 --> 2767.16
they don't really register

2784.16 --> 2789.7599999999998
i really appreciate you wanting to stick

2786.0 --> 2793.44
up for me right back i really do

2789.76 --> 2793.44
appreciate just know that

2794.0 --> 2799.04
you know they were followers once do

2801.44 --> 2805.44
right and i just kind of like

2807.52 --> 2813.04
to them it might seem like i just

2810.319 --> 2814.079
super inappropriately slapped them in

2813.04 --> 2815.359
the face

2814.079 --> 2819.44
in a moment where i should have

2815.359 --> 2819.44
absolutely not done that right

2821.2 --> 2826.16
but yeah guess what i will absolutely do

2824.88 --> 2829.52
that

2826.16 --> 2831.5989999999997
yeah absolutely like once i go there i

2829.52 --> 2833.92
go there and you better get out of the

2831.599 --> 2833.92
way

2836.48 --> 2841.119
that's just how i do it you better get

2838.88 --> 2842.6400000000003
out of the way because once the momentum

2841.119 --> 2845.44
gets going

2842.64 --> 2848.5589999999997
like i can never have regret

2845.44 --> 2851.359
if i go there i must go there

2848.559 --> 2853.3590000000004
and works a certain way and you can't

2851.359 --> 2855.359
stop that

2853.359 --> 2858.5589999999997
you can't step aside

2855.359 --> 2860.88
just let it happen for a while right i'm

2858.559 --> 2863.0400000000004
not it's not like oh that's now the new

2860.88 --> 2866.8
madness forever right you don't ever

2863.04 --> 2867.599
have to fear that it's not how it works

2866.8 --> 2871.119
right

2867.599 --> 2875.2000000000003
on average i have a very laid back

2871.119 --> 2875.2000000000003
level where everybody has this room and

2875.359 --> 2879.92
like i don't want people to really be in

2878.0 --> 2883.839
anguish or anything

2879.92 --> 2883.839
or like super drill sergeant

2885.359 --> 2889.5989999999997
but when

2886.559 --> 2891.44
energy gathers and something it happens

2889.599 --> 2893.3590000000004
something is done something is formed

2891.44 --> 2895.44
something's manifesting an idea

2893.359 --> 2898.839
conception

2895.44 --> 2901.2000000000003
a discipline an action

2898.839 --> 2903.599
then once i

2901.2 --> 2906.839
get the idea and i go for it don't get

2903.599 --> 2906.839
in the way

2914.0 --> 2918.72
there you go neil thanks

2917.2 --> 2920.96
yeah i heard

2918.72 --> 2923.04
yeah guns never unders for some reason

2920.96 --> 2927.8
really pissed off at me

2923.04 --> 2927.8
i don't even fully understand why

2928.72 --> 2934.319
maybe i don't know maybe it's because of

2931.2 --> 2936.5589999999997
that time when i was basically

2934.319 --> 2936.5589999999997
like

2937.599 --> 2942.6400000000003
vengeance warning

2939.839 --> 2944.88
america and all that like yeah

2942.64 --> 2947.52
like maybe it's better that like you get

2944.88 --> 2949.44
like giant craters everywhere and

2947.52 --> 2952.079
firebomb the [ __ ] out of the place while

2949.44 --> 2954.079
you're just like whacking off your your

2952.079 --> 2955.28
guns and all that [ __ ] and do nothing

2954.079 --> 2957.8390000000004
with it

2955.28 --> 2959.28
it might be that that part just kind of

2957.839 --> 2962.64
like

2959.28 --> 2965.3590000000004
it was too far for him

2962.64 --> 2968.16
or something

2965.359 --> 2973.44
i mean that guy has a lot of passion

2968.16 --> 2975.92
he's is a lot of pretty intense guy

2973.44 --> 2978.7200000000003
and maybe i made him snap a little i

2975.92 --> 2978.7200000000003
hope i haven't

2980.64 --> 2985.52
i mean

2982.559 --> 2989.599
those rants were definitely not

2985.52 --> 2991.839
specifically ate at him personally

2989.599 --> 2996.079
right

2991.839 --> 2996.0789999999997
i mean if you have typical

2996.16 --> 3002.319
passion rage like issues then already

2999.68 --> 3005.1189999999997
you almost certainly

3002.319 --> 3007.119
fall outside of the option range for the

3005.119 --> 3008.48
people that actually need to do that and

3007.119 --> 3010.6400000000003
am i addressing

3008.48 --> 3014.4
i'm really trying to get to people that

3010.64 --> 3014.4
are not sensitive at all

3014.96 --> 3019.2400000000002
that should have more sensibility

3020.16 --> 3023.839
not the people that are already like

3022.4 --> 3025.6800000000003
yelling

3023.839 --> 3027.68
on street

3025.68 --> 3029.52
tops and all that like ah we got to do

3027.68 --> 3032.0789999999997
something we got to do like no those

3029.52 --> 3034.24
people that you already know

3032.079 --> 3035.28
you've already been trying i'm just kind

3034.24 --> 3040.5589999999997
of

3035.28 --> 3044.7200000000003
upping the intensity in the message

3040.559 --> 3046.96
i wake the [ __ ] up do something now this

3044.72 --> 3048.5589999999997
is the price right

3046.96 --> 3051.28
you're standing

3048.559 --> 3053.52
on the edge of a walking plank

3051.28 --> 3055.6800000000003
on a ship

3053.52 --> 3059.119
their sharks below you

3055.68 --> 3060.96
the sea is getting kind of wild

3059.119 --> 3063.839
you're gonna lose balance at some point

3060.96 --> 3066.8
and there's only one guy with the spear

3063.839 --> 3068.7999999999997
who you know is ordered to kill you

3066.8 --> 3070.0
on the ship's side

3068.8 --> 3072.0
like what are you going to do are you

3070.0 --> 3073.68
going to keep standing there until

3072.0 --> 3075.04
you're certain you're going to fall off

3073.68 --> 3076.0
and then sharks are going to rip you

3075.04 --> 3078.96
apart

3076.0 --> 3081.44
or are you going to take a chance

3078.96 --> 3084.88
rush over to the guy with the spear and

3081.44 --> 3088.2400000000002
somehow avoid getting impilled

3084.88 --> 3089.92
and then bash him out of the way

3088.24 --> 3093.2
and save yourself

3089.92 --> 3094.4
right it's a big risk but

3093.2 --> 3096.7999999999997
i mean

3094.4 --> 3100.6800000000003
not doing anything is

3096.8 --> 3100.6800000000003
guaranteed fatal

3111.119 --> 3114.96
what

3113.359 --> 3116.72
okay neil

3114.96 --> 3118.96
geez was it that bad what the hell has

3116.72 --> 3121.4399999999996
he been saying

3118.96 --> 3121.44

3121.52 --> 3125.839

3151.119 --> 3158.7200000000003
look rick beck already informed me about

3154.16 --> 3158.72
it not exactly with what but

3161.599 --> 3167.2000000000003
damaging to you how can any blabbering

3165.2 --> 3170.3999999999996
of a guy that's never even shown their

3167.2 --> 3171.68
face be damaging to my character

3170.4 --> 3172.8
like

3171.68 --> 3174.96
more

3172.8 --> 3178.88
than everything that i've just been

3174.96 --> 3180.48
saying and displaying about myself

3178.88 --> 3183.28
seriously neil

3180.48 --> 3185.68
how is he damaging my character i mean

3183.28 --> 3189.0400000000004
if he's like oh he is secretly the

3185.68 --> 3191.5989999999997
antichrist or he's a satanist or a

3189.04 --> 3194.0
jesuit or a cia or

3191.599 --> 3196.079
like how is that damaging my character

3194.0 --> 3199.28
that's just making him look like a

3196.079 --> 3201.52
slanderous [ __ ] i hope you you do feel

3199.28 --> 3201.52
that

3206.839 --> 3211.52
right never heard of the guy

3209.68 --> 3213.839
yeah i can't embarrass a bit before your

3211.52 --> 3216.4
time but guns of navarone has also like

3213.839 --> 3219.599
supported my show

3216.4 --> 3220.839
like he's even sent me paypal he was

3219.599 --> 3224.319
really

3220.839 --> 3226.88
great then for some reason just

3224.319 --> 3231.52
he started to like politically disagree

3226.88 --> 3231.52
with things that i'm saying and all that

3232.559 --> 3238.96
that's it oh he called what what is it

3235.68 --> 3241.359
neil i mentioned a list of like 10

3238.96 --> 3241.359
things

3244.319 --> 3249.2
said i'm drunk and what

3248.24 --> 3252.4799999999996
what

3249.2 --> 3252.48
i don't drink

3252.559 --> 3261.76
during my show that's ridiculous

3256.64 --> 3261.7599999999998
i mean i sometimes get a beer during fed

3268.4 --> 3273.119
but i mean the last time that you could

3270.88 --> 3274.88
really hear like that i'm i've been

3273.119 --> 3277.119
drinking in my voice has been like

3274.88 --> 3279.2000000000003
during ball busters which is much later

3277.119 --> 3281.52
in the evening

3279.2 --> 3281.52
right

3282.96 --> 3288.559
but like even if i was drinking during

3285.92 --> 3291.52
the live show

3288.559 --> 3293.599
you wouldn't be able to hear that

3291.52 --> 3296.319
because i don't get the weird voice

3293.599 --> 3300.0
issue [ __ ]

3296.319 --> 3301.599
that only happens later in the evening

3300.0 --> 3304.0
like if i'm drinking

3301.599 --> 3307.839
while i'm kind of tired

3304.0 --> 3307.839
that's when that starts happening

3314.559 --> 3318.799
he gave me money i spent it badly

3319.52 --> 3321.839
okay

3327.68 --> 3330.0
wow

3332.96 --> 3336.88
that's that's just great so

3335.52 --> 3340.16
does that mean

3336.88 --> 3342.079
that he's now deciding like oh

3340.16 --> 3345.48
i'm gonna decide what irwin's gonna do

3342.079 --> 3345.48
with his money

3358.319 --> 3362.04
okay kinda bear

3371.2 --> 3377.2
it's none of their business right neil

3373.359 --> 3379.2
well i'm very clear every time

3377.2 --> 3382.72
with pretty much every situation like

3379.2 --> 3385.2799999999997
yeah donations are unconditional

3382.72 --> 3387.359
that includes me sometimes doing

3385.28 --> 3390.48
something really stupid

3387.359 --> 3393.119
with it and then regretting it massively

3390.48 --> 3393.119
afterward

3394.559 --> 3399.76
and i try to not do that

3398.079 --> 3400.96
because i really hate it when that

3399.76 --> 3403.3590000000004
happens

3400.96 --> 3405.44
but yeah most of the like i'm very

3403.359 --> 3407.7599999999998
minimalist

3405.44 --> 3410.319
i just

3407.76 --> 3412.1600000000003
i'm like boring

3410.319 --> 3413.359
in that sense

3412.16 --> 3416.72
i don't

3413.359 --> 3419.839
spend yeah i don't go places spend money

3416.72 --> 3419.839
like i don't do that

3420.799 --> 3425.2
i just kind of get my food

3423.599 --> 3428.1600000000003
supplements

3425.2 --> 3430.64
that are really good for me like

3428.16 --> 3433.5989999999997
so empirical i test them that's not

3430.64 --> 3435.839
using them versus using them through the

3433.599 --> 3439.04
periods of the of the year

3435.839 --> 3442.5589999999997
getting a system in it

3439.04 --> 3444.16
yeah i do spend money on cannabis too

3442.559 --> 3447.8390000000004
but yeah it's

3444.16 --> 3447.839
it does a lot of good for me

3448.0 --> 3452.079
just yeah

3450.079 --> 3455.28
it's a bit expensive

3452.079 --> 3455.28
that's unfortunate

3455.52 --> 3461.359
but then again i'm not like like this

3459.839 --> 3463.359
stoner that just

3461.359 --> 3465.52
like

3463.359 --> 3469.92
like gets giant amounts

3465.52 --> 3469.92
through constantly absolutely not

3472.0 --> 3476.0
so it i think it's i'm pretty well

3474.64 --> 3478.64
balanced

3476.0 --> 3478.64
i really do

3482.799 --> 3486.559
right so it just sounds like he's gone

3485.2 --> 3488.24
full gamma

3486.559 --> 3490.6400000000003
and it happens it's i've seen it happen

3488.24 --> 3492.799
to many it's like

3490.64 --> 3495.359
i've

3492.799 --> 3496.72
the amount of people that have come come

3495.359 --> 3499.44
on my show

3496.72 --> 3502.0
were friends and then went full gamma

3499.44 --> 3504.96
rage and basically started yelling and

3502.0 --> 3506.4
screaming about how terrible i am about

3504.96 --> 3507.76
everything

3506.4 --> 3510.319
yeah

3507.76 --> 3512.4
like cursing me to know it that that's

3510.319 --> 3514.799
more people than i can count on both

3512.4 --> 3514.799
hands

3515.28 --> 3519.76
really

3517.44 --> 3520.88
so i'm like okay here here goes another

3519.76 --> 3522.96
one

3520.88 --> 3524.88
it's like

3522.96 --> 3527.68
they were seemed to be friends but they

3524.88 --> 3527.6800000000003
were more like

3528.319 --> 3533.119
like fire arrows and then at some point

3530.799 --> 3534.88
they just go off

3533.119 --> 3537.359
and then it just yay

3534.88 --> 3537.359
goody

3537.76 --> 3544.1600000000003
and they kind of keep their distance

3540.799 --> 3548.16
and that's it

3544.16 --> 3550.16
some of them actually kind of like even

3548.16 --> 3553.68
get back to normal

3550.16 --> 3553.68
like for example agm

3554.0 --> 3559.64
we've had a lot of back and forth and

3556.0 --> 3559.64
i've even been

3560.16 --> 3564.319
lesser like lesser quality strict with

3563.04 --> 3567.68
him

3564.319 --> 3570.16
in ways but he's been a great sport he

3567.68 --> 3571.2
has just like impulse issues and he

3570.16 --> 3573.7599999999998
knows it

3571.2 --> 3575.9199999999996
but he's pretty cool

3573.76 --> 3578.7200000000003
but he gets like really

3575.92 --> 3579.76
like crazy at times like obsessive and

3578.72 --> 3582.0789999999997
all that

3579.76 --> 3583.28
savonya complex and he's had that many

3582.079 --> 3585.28
times

3583.28 --> 3587.119
but like

3585.28 --> 3589.44
when he's out of that at least he knows

3587.119 --> 3591.52
and he's respective

3589.44 --> 3594.64
so i kind of still like him he doesn't

3591.52 --> 3596.4
really hang around here anymore

3594.64 --> 3599.4
i think he's just found another type of

3596.4 --> 3599.4
crowd

3602.72 --> 3609.04
so yeah it just happens

3605.28 --> 3611.44
it's okay it's just how it works

3609.04 --> 3614.4
it's mostly embarrassing to them like if

3611.44 --> 3616.799
somebody is just screaming

3614.4 --> 3618.799
trying to destroy somebody's reputation

3616.799 --> 3621.92
they're effectively

3618.799 --> 3624.0
just embarrassing themselves

3621.92 --> 3627.2400000000002
there's no good reason to do something

3624.0 --> 3627.24
like that

3631.68 --> 3634.16
right

3632.48 --> 3637.04
if they do it about

3634.16 --> 3638.8799999999997
anybody else in the community it would

3637.04 --> 3641.2799999999997
also be embarrassing so in the end

3638.88 --> 3644.2400000000002
people that do that are just like gamma

3641.28 --> 3646.4
squared raging

3644.24 --> 3648.64
and they're embarrassing themselves

3646.4 --> 3651.52
they're getting possessed

3648.64 --> 3654.319
by envy and bitterness and then they

3651.52 --> 3654.319
just do that

3655.119 --> 3659.599
it's very pathetic it's a sign of

3657.119 --> 3659.599
weakness

3662.0 --> 3666.559
and the better they the sooner they

3664.48 --> 3668.88
realize the better because

3666.559 --> 3671.0400000000004
yeah you can like set a whole bunch of

3668.88 --> 3674.48
scars for yourself i know because i've

3671.04 --> 3677.599
done that sort of [ __ ] in the past

3674.48 --> 3682.04
it's terrible once you wake up from that

3677.599 --> 3682.04
and realize what you've done terrible

3684.16 --> 3691.0789999999997
so yeah if you have that you gotta

3686.16 --> 3691.0789999999997
freaking work on it and work on it hard

3716.799 --> 3721.119
all right adam price yeah i appreciate

3718.559 --> 3726.119
that but i think i'm pretty honest right

3721.119 --> 3726.119
about what i what i do with the sport

3735.68 --> 3740.48
i mean

3737.76 --> 3745.3590000000004
would you rather that i just make up a

3740.48 --> 3745.359
like a more exciting cover story

3746.16 --> 3750.16
of what i'm supposedly doing with it

3750.72 --> 3755.4399999999996
so that you feel better about it

3753.119 --> 3757.119
or can i just be honest about what i'm

3755.44 --> 3760.2400000000002
actually

3757.119 --> 3762.48
needing it for and spending it on

3760.24 --> 3762.4799999999996
right

3765.119 --> 3771.359
i mean there are for sure people out

3767.359 --> 3774.16
there that literally make up [ __ ]

3771.359 --> 3774.16
to get people's

3780.839 --> 3786.2
donations i don't want to be part of

3953.51 --> 3956.659
[Music]

yeah how's the sound holding up guys

3967.28 --> 3971.44
is it still working good

3969.359 --> 3974.44
i haven't really looked all the time

3971.44 --> 3974.44
anymore

4059.92 --> 4064.079
hello

4060.839 --> 4066.319
ah it just turned off out of nowhere i

4064.079 --> 4067.52
didn't even hear a a bleep sound or

4066.319 --> 4069.119
whatever

4067.52 --> 4072.44
weird

4069.119 --> 4072.44
it's back

4086.4 --> 4089.799
right so

4103.759 --> 4107.56
what's going on here

4130.56 --> 4136.799
anybody know what owen benjamin's show

4132.799 --> 4138.64
was about i haven't watched it yet

4136.799 --> 4142.88
something about

4138.64 --> 4142.88
nightmares and fear merchants

4145.679 --> 4149.12
i think i know what that's about

4150.56 --> 4154.56
probably like the whole snake venom

4152.48 --> 4157.3589999999995
thing and

4154.56 --> 4159.52
and just like threats of world like

4157.359 --> 4161.52
nuclear bombs and all that yeah because

4159.52 --> 4163.279
they are getting rolled out hard right

4161.52 --> 4165.359
now

4163.279 --> 4167.279
right because of the spring moment

4165.359 --> 4171.279
because everybody's more susceptible

4167.279 --> 4171.279
more easily spell bound

4171.44 --> 4175.3189999999995
basically called it

4183.279 --> 4186.279
hmm

4198.719 --> 4202.52
hey gum nut man

4206.719 --> 4209.04
uh

4209.199 --> 4213.12
wait what

4210.48 --> 4216.759999999999
but you've been here before

4213.12 --> 4216.76
pretty damn sure

4220.96 --> 4225.679
do you just check

4223.36 --> 4225.679
yeah

4226.48 --> 4230.239
well

4227.679 --> 4232.8
i chat but i chat about a lot of things

4230.239 --> 4235.12
and some things

4232.8 --> 4238.400000000001
which are kind of at the the heart of it

4235.12 --> 4240.64
all is flat earth

4238.4 --> 4242.719
right that's why the titles in the name

4240.64 --> 4244.88
the name is in the

4242.719 --> 4249.0
in the title

4244.88 --> 4249.0
flat earth early bird

4268.4 --> 4273.599999999999
is there specific subjects

4270.96 --> 4276.32
for each episode no not really gunmet

4273.6 --> 4276.320000000001
i'm not man

4277.52 --> 4279.76
but

4282.719 --> 4287.36
i don't know usually there's like two or

4285.28 --> 4288.32
three different type of subjects that

4287.36 --> 4289.839999999999
get

4288.32 --> 4291.92
like

4289.84 --> 4294.08
treated and then everybody talks about

4291.92 --> 4294.88
that for a while and then you move on

4294.08 --> 4297.76
and

4294.88 --> 4300.64
sometimes i get super inspired and then

4297.76 --> 4302.88
it can get all over the place

4300.64 --> 4302.88
right

4307.12 --> 4311.84
yeah it's not so much about flat earth

4309.36 --> 4313.599999999999
anyway usually so yeah sometimes trolls

4311.84 --> 4315.679
come in

4313.6 --> 4320.2390000000005
and then i'm like i feel forced to

4315.679 --> 4321.92
basically roll out the basic flat earth

4320.239 --> 4323.5199999999995
things that i've learned

4321.92 --> 4328.36
about the mechanics like relative

4323.52 --> 4328.360000000001
density and gravity and

4328.96 --> 4333.679
like spatial dynamics right

4331.44 --> 4336.48
going back into my own modeling what i

4333.679 --> 4339.84
think is going on because it is all just

4336.48 --> 4342.0
kind of a yeah a difficult field

4339.84 --> 4344.8
and i've specialized in that it's just

4342.0 --> 4346.88
that i've kind of

4344.8 --> 4348.0
explored all i could

4346.88 --> 4350.32
from

4348.0 --> 4350.32
here

4350.88 --> 4354.96
like

4352.08 --> 4357.5199999999995
i think i got it pretty sized up as to

4354.96 --> 4359.04
all the the wide range of different

4357.52 --> 4361.4400000000005
potentials

4359.04 --> 4363.5199999999995
what it could be

4361.44 --> 4365.04
like i don't think i'm gonna really bump

4363.52 --> 4367.6
into something at this point that's

4365.04 --> 4369.36
gonna like architecturally really

4367.6 --> 4373.84
surprise me

4369.36 --> 4373.839999999999
concerning this realm design

4375.76 --> 4380.96
right who knows maybe i'll be like whoa

4378.4 --> 4382.96
[ __ ] i never thought of that but i i

4380.96 --> 4386.8
doubt it

4382.96 --> 4386.8
i've been thinking about it a lot

4387.52 --> 4396.52
right but who knows god's

4389.84 --> 4396.52
depth go beyond imagining so who knows

4415.84 --> 4418.159000000001
what

4425.199 --> 4432.4
this is a transgender support channel

4429.04 --> 4432.4
what the [ __ ] are you back

4435.04 --> 4438.44
what the hell

4441.679 --> 4446.64
oh my god that's no

4444.4 --> 4446.639999999999
no

4447.04 --> 4449.76
don't do it

4451.679 --> 4456.4800000000005
but i mean if you've gone through it

4453.76 --> 4458.8
already i'll be like okay

4456.48 --> 4460.879999999999
i'm not gonna like just

4458.8 --> 4463.6
you've already basically

4460.88 --> 4466.32
got scars that don't need to punish you

4463.6 --> 4468.0
any further unless you're a demonically

4466.32 --> 4470.639999999999
possessed freak and then i gotta

4468.0 --> 4473.52
basically exercise you

4470.64 --> 4475.679
right that's about it

4473.52 --> 4477.4400000000005
i have no

4475.679 --> 4479.92
yeah

4477.44 --> 4481.12
don't have any hostilities against trans

4479.92 --> 4483.76
people

4481.12 --> 4487.0
i just if they're really gay that i find

4483.76 --> 4487.0
that annoying

4503.28 --> 4508.199
it's a bizarre thing to say rick back

4512.88 --> 4517.4800000000005
look at what you made me say now

4533.92 --> 4539.12
either at 10

4536.48 --> 4541.44
dollars a bag

4539.12 --> 4543.679
you mean that stuff that makes you pass

4541.44 --> 4543.678999999999
out

4544.719 --> 4550.76
be careful with that

4547.76 --> 4550.76
gorzilla

4575.76 --> 4579.360000000001
rv truth all he does is read the chat

4578.48 --> 4581.839999999999
really

4579.36 --> 4584.719
he does that too

4581.84 --> 4586.2390000000005
so rv truth like in his own way does

4584.719 --> 4588.08
what i do

4586.239 --> 4592.04
or i do what he does i don't know maybe

4588.08 --> 4592.04
he started doing that earlier

4611.44 --> 4615.36
the big dollars is in moondust

4615.92 --> 4620.28
oh dear out here right here

4629.12 --> 4633.5199999999995
the nature of the dome will be

4631.199 --> 4634.799999999999
surprising for me

4633.52 --> 4636.96
who knows

4634.8 --> 4639.4400000000005
the nature behind that what do you mean

4636.96 --> 4639.44
behind

4642.88 --> 4646.400000000001
why do you assume there's something

4644.4 --> 4648.96
behind what do you think that

4646.4 --> 4652.239
our realm

4648.96 --> 4656.4800000000005
is like just one little place in an

4652.239 --> 4658.5599999999995
infinite scape of something

4656.48 --> 4663.0
why would you assume that

4658.56 --> 4663.0
haven't you learned your lesson already

4665.04 --> 4670.48
why would you assume that there is more

4667.36 --> 4674.239
beyond a dome

4670.48 --> 4677.36
why would you think that there is more

4674.239 --> 4679.839999999999
manifested material space beyond

4677.36 --> 4679.839999999999
creation

4686.64 --> 4693.84
like unless you got to see more like

4689.6 --> 4693.84
actually see it not in your imagination

4695.6 --> 4701.04
all right i mean i think there's

4697.76 --> 4702.400000000001
potentially a different realm segments

4701.04 --> 4707.84
right

4702.4 --> 4707.839999999999
maybe like our realm is a cell

4708.64 --> 4714.88
like a cell of a light giant cell wall

4712.48 --> 4718.08
or even three-dimensional of a whole

4714.88 --> 4723.1990000000005
bunch of realms that are like

4718.08 --> 4725.76
spatially separate but that can connect

4723.199 --> 4729.36
like through physical existence and then

4725.76 --> 4730.719
separated by non-physical existence

4729.36 --> 4732.839999999999
but still

4730.719 --> 4736.2390000000005
like underneath it all

4732.84 --> 4737.28
connected so that they could physically

4736.239 --> 4739.28
connect

4737.28 --> 4740.719
yeah it's getting kind of surreal at

4739.28 --> 4743.44
that point but

4740.719 --> 4746.92
hey it's what i try to figure out what

4743.44 --> 4746.919999999999
could be possible

4754.96 --> 4759.92
right but i don't think there is just

4756.96 --> 4763.44
like this one singular

4759.92 --> 4765.679
infinite material existence you see

4763.44 --> 4768.719
i don't think it just keeps on going and

4765.679 --> 4772.88
going forever no

4768.719 --> 4772.88
it just no there it no

4773.36 --> 4780.5599999999995
it only seems logical that there can

4775.92 --> 4780.56
only be a finite amount of matter

4784.239 --> 4788.678999999999
and a finite amount of space

4796.159 --> 4801.36
right at least within a confine

4799.12 --> 4801.36
like

4801.76 --> 4806.4800000000005
a theorem wow

4803.52 --> 4810.080000000001
that's fascinating actually

4806.48 --> 4810.08
never thought of it like that before

4811.679 --> 4815.159
but yeah

4820.48 --> 4824.32
maybe

4822.159 --> 4826.08
maybe

4824.32 --> 4830.159
yeah

4826.08 --> 4832.8
if there's separated loop segments

4830.159 --> 4835.599999999999
the matter and the space of physical

4832.8 --> 4837.360000000001
existence would be finite

4835.6 --> 4839.280000000001
thereby

4837.36 --> 4842.159
being stable

4839.28 --> 4842.159
but what if

4842.8 --> 4846.400000000001
separated

4845.04 --> 4848.4
from other

4846.4 --> 4849.44
realm segments

4848.4 --> 4853.599999999999
what

4849.44 --> 4854.638999999999
maybe there's infinite realm segments

4853.6 --> 4858.56
they just

4854.639 --> 4860.96
are never there's no singular infinite

4858.56 --> 4864.0
physical space

4860.96 --> 4864.88
but maybe if it is all separated and

4864.0 --> 4867.36
could

4864.88 --> 4869.4400000000005
sporadically interconnect then there

4867.36 --> 4873.199
could maybe

4869.44 --> 4875.5199999999995
be infinite realm segments

4873.199 --> 4878.638999999999
that basically

4875.52 --> 4878.639
don't coexist

4878.96 --> 4883.199
yeah

4881.04 --> 4885.84
time bubble worlds that

4883.199 --> 4888.879999999999
one way of saving

4885.84 --> 4891.6
because that would that would bridge

4888.88 --> 4893.4400000000005
there is the concept of there's no

4891.6 --> 4896.159000000001
infinite amount of matter that's not

4893.44 --> 4898.32
logical like that would actually bridge

4896.159 --> 4898.32
it

4899.04 --> 4904.239
but yeah it doesn't mean that it's

4900.719 --> 4904.2390000000005
automatically true though

4907.84 --> 4913.6
but it does kind of bypass

4910.96 --> 4913.6
that issue

4915.12 --> 4918.8
melty realm yeah yeah it is

4917.84 --> 4920.88
very

4918.8 --> 4922.96
it it already started to remi

4920.88 --> 4925.84
immediately when i thought it started

4922.96 --> 4927.36
the idea seemed like the multiverse idea

4925.84 --> 4930.2390000000005
yeah

4927.36 --> 4933.199
but what if it's just like cells like

4930.239 --> 4934.959999999999
infinite amount of realm cells

4933.199 --> 4937.36
and they can

4934.96 --> 4939.36
connect they can't click suddenly

4937.36 --> 4941.5199999999995
they connect and they're they're one

4939.36 --> 4943.759999999999
there's a bridge

4941.52 --> 4945.280000000001
and then the bridge disconnects again

4943.76 --> 4946.8
and then maybe another bridge can

4945.28 --> 4951.36
connect up

4946.8 --> 4954.4800000000005
right and every time there's always a a

4951.36 --> 4956.48
new limited amount like a set amount of

4954.48 --> 4959.919999999999
material and space

4956.48 --> 4963.839999999999
in one singular well rendering you could

4959.92 --> 4965.159
say let's get full simulatory talk

4963.84 --> 4969.92
in one

4965.159 --> 4969.92
manifestation in one manifested realm

4970.239 --> 4974.159
one space

4972.48 --> 4975.12
there would be a limited amount every

4974.159 --> 4977.28
time

4975.12 --> 4980.239
but yeah then

4977.28 --> 4982.239
depending on like how many segments are

4980.239 --> 4983.44
there

4982.239 --> 4986.5599999999995
like

4983.44 --> 4989.44
if there were more than thousands

4986.56 --> 4991.679
would we ever even be able to figure

4989.44 --> 4993.678999999999
that out

4991.679 --> 4996.0
the way it's been arranged like maybe

4993.679 --> 4998.639
it's a giant

4996.0 --> 5001.92
giant infinite maze

4998.639 --> 5006.719
of realm segments that like a puzzle

5001.92 --> 5007.84
connect and disconnect at a certain

5006.719 --> 5010.639
system

5007.84 --> 5013.04
very similar to like the celestial sky

5010.639 --> 5014.96
clock and like maybe each of the realm

5013.04 --> 5017.76
segments has their own sky clock and

5014.96 --> 5020.719
maybe they're all like every sky clock

5017.76 --> 5023.12
is like another radar in a in a larger

5020.719 --> 5023.12
puzzle

5024.32 --> 5027.32
damn

5038.32 --> 5043.239
right so there you go for your flat

5040.239 --> 5043.239
earth

5045.52 --> 5052.76
i could paint something like that

5048.96 --> 5052.76
it's gonna be pretty cool

5080.159 --> 5085.719
perhaps it's what cern is about lol

5086.32 --> 5091.44
well jeff gas said that's really weird

5089.84 --> 5095.6
i don't know

5091.44 --> 5095.599999999999
is there like a magnetic thing

5096.48 --> 5102.08
is it like is that

5099.36 --> 5103.759999999999
dude if there were literally just ways

5102.08 --> 5106.0
to like

5103.76 --> 5108.8
force the realm connection based on

5106.0 --> 5111.199
electric activity right

5108.8 --> 5114.0
maybe there is like a magnetic lock that

5111.199 --> 5116.239
makes realm segments connect or

5114.0 --> 5120.88
disconnect

5116.239 --> 5123.04
yeah so maybe freaking cern is like a

5120.88 --> 5125.1990000000005
an attempt

5123.04 --> 5127.36
maybe it is like a

5125.199 --> 5129.678999999999
a key for that

5127.36 --> 5130.719
this is getting really sci-fi at this

5129.679 --> 5133.12
point

5130.719 --> 5136.08
because i think it's probably absolutely

5133.12 --> 5139.76
nothing and just a giant waste of energy

5136.08 --> 5141.28
maybe it was an attempt

5139.76 --> 5143.12
to do that

5141.28 --> 5146.4
maybe they thought

5143.12 --> 5148.48
that they could like force the realms to

5146.4 --> 5150.159
reconnect maybe they they're already

5148.48 --> 5152.239
like yeah

5150.159 --> 5154.5599999999995
we're already one new world order

5152.239 --> 5157.199
basically

5154.56 --> 5160.0
so we're gonna we got invasion power

5157.199 --> 5162.159
let's like connect the realm and invade

5160.0 --> 5165.44
and like plunder it all oh we have a new

5162.159 --> 5167.36
golden age just like the renaissance

5165.44 --> 5169.28
except now we don't plunder the earth

5167.36 --> 5170.88
but we were just plundering an entire

5169.28 --> 5173.679
realm right

5170.88 --> 5176.0
and then it didn't work

5173.679 --> 5178.88
maybe that's how it happened right and

5176.0 --> 5180.4
then you got all these invasion plans

5178.88 --> 5182.719
it didn't work and then what are you

5180.4 --> 5184.96
gonna do well they're gonna of course to

5182.719 --> 5187.36
return to their own people guess what's

5184.96 --> 5188.159
happening right now

5187.36 --> 5190.48
yeah

5188.159 --> 5192.638999999999
maybe they were actually planning to

5190.48 --> 5194.959999999999
invade another realm

5192.639 --> 5197.84
and then it failed to they failed to

5194.96 --> 5197.84
open the door

5199.04 --> 5202.0
like

5200.0 --> 5204.96
what i'm saying right now might not

5202.0 --> 5206.08
actually be too far off what really was

5204.96 --> 5210.36
happening

5206.08 --> 5210.36
on a super high level

5210.56 --> 5214.719
where they do actually know exactly how

5212.96 --> 5216.719
the mechanics of the realm works and

5214.719 --> 5219.92
everything

5216.719 --> 5221.44
man i'd love to like get a gaze at those

5219.92 --> 5223.1990000000005
maps

5221.44 --> 5226.638999999999
where they basically have

5223.199 --> 5228.879999999999
a layout of the different realm segments

5226.639 --> 5230.8
right it might be all just a bunch of

5228.88 --> 5233.4400000000005
circles like all these different types

5230.8 --> 5233.4400000000005
of circles

5234.08 --> 5238.5599999999995
or maybe they got it projected like

5236.239 --> 5241.44
rectangles and it's basically a giant

5238.56 --> 5244.400000000001
grid board that's all separated like a

5241.44 --> 5246.719
whole bunch of squares

5244.4 --> 5249.719
fascinating

5246.719 --> 5249.719
ah

5261.36 --> 5269.679
come on tara 306 don't don't talk like

5265.12 --> 5269.679
that why do you do that

5272.719 --> 5277.36
but yes i think that

5274.88 --> 5278.400000000001
no i don't think by the way the shield

5277.36 --> 5280.96
yeah

5278.4 --> 5283.599999999999
every time i see somebody say that they

5280.96 --> 5286.2390000000005
never say it right

5283.6 --> 5288.4800000000005
if you call somebody a shill you

5286.239 --> 5290.799999999999
literally don't know what a shill is

5288.48 --> 5295.759999999999
don't say that

5290.8 --> 5297.1990000000005
stupid it's one of the things he does

5295.76 --> 5300.1990000000005
like

5297.199 --> 5301.839999999999
rv is a [ __ ] plant he plants

5300.199 --> 5304.879999999999
retardation

5301.84 --> 5304.88
he's a paranoid

5305.199 --> 5308.48
blabberer

5306.639 --> 5311.4400000000005
he makes up [ __ ]

5308.48 --> 5315.839999999999
and he constantly persecutes everybody

5311.44 --> 5320.44
for things that he's doing and worse

5315.84 --> 5320.4400000000005
it's a projecting scumbag

5323.679 --> 5328.32
and massive savonia complex

5329.52 --> 5335.2390000000005
and he overplays himself like crazy

5336.08 --> 5340.96
he really thinks he's a special boy when

5338.56 --> 5344.080000000001
he is like grossly incompetent in

5340.96 --> 5346.639
certain fields and he just pretends like

5344.08 --> 5346.639
he's not

5347.84 --> 5350.84
terrible

5356.56 --> 5360.320000000001
alex jones has filed for bankruptcy yeah

5358.719 --> 5362.56
i heard that he's not doing all that

5360.32 --> 5362.5599999999995
well

5363.679 --> 5367.0
kind of sad

5389.28 --> 5394.239
right anyway i hope what i've been

5391.6 --> 5397.2390000000005
saying was interesting up until the rv

5394.239 --> 5397.239
point

5445.76 --> 5452.6
yeah matthew hall you're probably right

5448.159 --> 5452.599999999999
never go full rv yep

5479.199 --> 5482.48
you don't know who rv is from godzilla

5481.52 --> 5485.360000000001
really

5482.48 --> 5485.36
russian vids

5486.4 --> 5494.0
he's been around like since second wave

5490.88 --> 5496.639
and he's he's like a shill

5494.0 --> 5498.56
he's like a shield charger he's like one

5496.639 --> 5501.679
of the first people that just started

5498.56 --> 5503.360000000001
calling everybody shields just like

5501.679 --> 5505.679
eric dubay

5503.36 --> 5507.5199999999995
even eric to bay like that's what i

5505.679 --> 5509.92
remember mostly

5507.52 --> 5512.320000000001
like the alta it was the ultimate savage

5509.92 --> 5515.32
war just everybody's a shill like

5512.32 --> 5515.32
everybody

5535.92 --> 5539.84
multi-realm

5537.28 --> 5542.159
it's almost a certain well rick mac yeah

5539.84 --> 5545.28
the thing is

5542.159 --> 5548.159
i've seen imagery

5545.28 --> 5551.12
like quite a while ago i don't even was

5548.159 --> 5551.12
it from like some

5551.44 --> 5556.719
hindu religion

5554.4 --> 5558.96
documentary or i don't even remember

5556.719 --> 5560.88
where i freaking saw it but it's already

5558.96 --> 5562.32
the suggestion like yeah there's like

5560.88 --> 5564.88
multiple eggs

5562.32 --> 5566.32
but they for some reason they always say

5564.88 --> 5567.92
it's eggs

5566.32 --> 5568.799999999999
right in hindu

5567.92 --> 5571.4400000000005
stuff

5568.8 --> 5572.88
in the realms and it's like yes one egg

5571.44 --> 5574.5599999999995
and there's another and another and

5572.88 --> 5578.0
another and then you got to see like

5574.56 --> 5580.400000000001
yeah there's just this giant row lineup

5578.0 --> 5583.36
of eggs everywhere

5580.4 --> 5586.32
in like in the void in like this weird

5583.36 --> 5586.32
blue void

5587.76 --> 5592.8
so that was like super trippy and i

5590.639 --> 5595.04
remember seeing that like in at a very

5592.8 --> 5598.8
young age and then like my spirit just

5595.04 --> 5598.8
bursting forth through my eyes like

5600.84 --> 5604.96
like think

5603.6 --> 5606.96
uh

5604.96 --> 5608.96
think lucius from

5606.96 --> 5610.08
therma romana i know

5608.96 --> 5611.84
right

5610.08 --> 5613.76
like seeing something and then being

5611.84 --> 5616.400000000001
like oh my god

5613.76 --> 5618.8
this is something really

5616.4 --> 5618.799999999999
big

5619.11 --> 5622.228999999999
[Music]

5623.36 --> 5626.5599999999995
right not as not the egg shape but just

5625.76 --> 5628.08
like

5626.56 --> 5630.159000000001
the way

5628.08 --> 5630.96
it showed

5630.159 --> 5633.199
like

5630.96 --> 5635.92
yeah a separated realm like this is

5633.199 --> 5638.08
physical space this is where physicality

5635.92 --> 5640.0
exists within outside there doesn't

5638.08 --> 5641.199
exist physicality

5640.0 --> 5644.52
there

5641.199 --> 5644.5199999999995
is another

5644.88 --> 5649.1990000000005
physical isolated space in which

5647.28 --> 5650.159
physicality existed outside if it

5649.199 --> 5651.919999999999
doesn't

5650.159 --> 5653.839999999999
and then there and then there and then

5651.92 --> 5655.84
there and

5653.84 --> 5658.8
and that just like

5655.84 --> 5661.1990000000005
holy [ __ ] like it wasn't even like said

5658.8 --> 5663.92
to me it's just i saw that imagery and i

5661.199 --> 5666.919999999999
was like wow

5663.92 --> 5666.92
wow

5672.4 --> 5679.599999999999
right for me it's not actually i think

5675.199 --> 5679.599999999999
they're literally more like rectangles

5680.159 --> 5684.839999999999
like or tubes or

5683.6 --> 5686.4800000000005
or

5684.84 --> 5688.56
squares

5686.48 --> 5692.0
it would actually make sense if it all

5688.56 --> 5694.56
be like perfect squares but

5692.0 --> 5697.92
because of the the symmetry of that

5694.56 --> 5701.360000000001
but then again yeah like what is the

5697.92 --> 5704.2390000000005
total realm confined shape you know

5701.36 --> 5708.159
not the the surface of the earth shade

5704.239 --> 5710.799999999999
no the realm confined shape what is the

5708.159 --> 5713.5199999999995
exact shape of the volume

5710.8 --> 5716.08
of physical existence of our realm

5713.52 --> 5718.400000000001
segment what is it

5716.08 --> 5718.4
is

5718.56 --> 5723.84
could it be possible

5720.56 --> 5728.679
that there are different realm segments

5723.84 --> 5728.679
that are not all shaped the same

5729.119 --> 5733.599999999999
right

5730.0 --> 5737.04
maybe there is a giant

5733.6 --> 5738.96
pattern to what the realm shape is in

5737.04 --> 5742.719
relation to the other realm maybe they

5738.96 --> 5748.159
were like originally one big puzzle

5742.719 --> 5748.159
maybe it was all once connected into one

5748.56 --> 5753.52
it would make more sense if there were

5751.119 --> 5757.759999999999
in like a titan age where

5753.52 --> 5759.6
who knows like a singular being would be

5757.76 --> 5762.08
like the size of

5759.6 --> 5764.719
of half the entire realm right then it

5762.08 --> 5766.88
would make more sense if once all the

5764.719 --> 5768.96
realm segments would have been connected

5766.88 --> 5772.0
directly

5768.96 --> 5773.04
there's more room for a giant titan then

5772.0 --> 5775.52
right

5773.04 --> 5777.5199999999995
and then as all that stopped and it all

5775.52 --> 5780.320000000001
became smaller that then at some point

5777.52 --> 5782.88
it became separated all they separated

5780.32 --> 5785.84
it was all separate

5782.88 --> 5785.84
whoo

5793.04 --> 5796.96
honeycombs

5794.639 --> 5799.84
right that could be an option maybe

5796.96 --> 5799.84
they're six sided

5801.52 --> 5807.679
maybe it maybe it's like six sided now

5804.4 --> 5807.679
but this would be freaky

5811.04 --> 5814.719
but yeah you never really know

5817.679 --> 5822.84
projected like a globe around a flat

5819.84 --> 5822.84
plate

5828.48 --> 5834.799999999999
but i mean it it would be interesting or

5832.639 --> 5837.119
like if it all spheres then it kind of

5834.8 --> 5840.0
symmetrically fits right like just like

5837.119 --> 5842.88
you would stack up marbles you get that

5840.0 --> 5845.119
certain pattern it kind of fits

5842.88 --> 5845.119
but

5846.8 --> 5850.400000000001
like that

5848.159 --> 5852.4
then they could never have truly been

5850.4 --> 5854.48
connected then they would have always

5852.4 --> 5856.879999999999
been separate you see

5854.48 --> 5860.32
but what if

5856.88 --> 5863.119
realms are shaped in a certain

5860.32 --> 5863.119
specific

5863.92 --> 5867.6
shape

5864.96 --> 5870.4800000000005
that would have once made them all fit

5867.6 --> 5872.0
together like one

5870.48 --> 5874.159
you see

5872.0 --> 5876.8
that they all spatially interconnected

5874.159 --> 5876.799999999999
at some point

5877.76 --> 5882.2390000000005
like a big puzzle that was just

5880.159 --> 5885.92
separated and everything became its

5882.239 --> 5888.32
separate thing because of the the scale

5885.92 --> 5890.719
of the creatures in it

5888.32 --> 5892.96
like it

5890.719 --> 5895.199
the whole thing would have been too big

5892.96 --> 5897.36
it would like it would have been a

5895.199 --> 5899.44
reason for the separation separate

5897.36 --> 5902.48
develop isolation

5899.44 --> 5902.48
see what comes out

5903.92 --> 5908.04
i'm tripping on this man

5916.84 --> 5920.659000000001
[Music]

5925.27 --> 5928.419000000001
[Music]

5929.679 --> 5935.28
right by the way

5932.239 --> 5937.5199999999995
infinite realm segments

5935.28 --> 5941.759999999999
not likely

5937.52 --> 5945.76
right still i was saying that earlier

5941.76 --> 5945.76
but it seems very unlikely

5946.32 --> 5950.639
like it's

5948.639 --> 5953.4400000000005
there's not going to be one singular

5950.639 --> 5955.119
interconnected infinite plane

5953.44 --> 5957.678999999999
there's not going to be an infinite

5955.119 --> 5959.36
amount of separated

5957.679 --> 5961.92
things

5959.36 --> 5964.5599999999995
because that technically still doesn't

5961.92 --> 5969.6
make sense

5964.56 --> 5969.6
like because like if it's separated

5969.84 --> 5975.1990000000005
then either like yeah

5973.199 --> 5977.36
if it would have been one at one point

5975.199 --> 5979.599999999999
then it still cannot be infinite it

5977.36 --> 5981.5199999999995
could be extremely fast though you know

5979.6 --> 5984.2390000000005
maybe there's like

5981.52 --> 5986.159000000001
six million

5984.239 --> 5989.199
segments

5986.159 --> 5991.28
like a thousand would already be like

5989.199 --> 5993.28
way more than anything could ever

5991.28 --> 5995.84
oversee

5993.28 --> 5995.84
right

5996.719 --> 6000.639
like that's going to be almost

5998.0 --> 6003.6
impossible to explore throughout

6000.639 --> 6005.76
existence for however long that lasts

6003.6 --> 6008.76
which can't be infinite

6005.76 --> 6008.76
either

6009.119 --> 6012.48
but if it's like a six million then how

6011.119 --> 6015.5199999999995
the hell would you

6012.48 --> 6016.718999999999
like even get close to like they would

6015.52 --> 6019.119000000001
just say okay

6016.719 --> 6022.159
it must be infinite like totally

6019.119 --> 6024.639
unfamiliar things just

6022.159 --> 6027.599999999999
subtly out of nowhere connect here and

6024.639 --> 6029.119
then it's like what is this like nothing

6027.6 --> 6031.76
like that

6029.119 --> 6033.839999999999
ever been recorded

6031.76 --> 6035.52
and then how would you ever

6033.84 --> 6038.719
come to the conclusion like there's a

6035.52 --> 6038.719
limited amount you see

6040.08 --> 6047.4
i'm getting a bit meta maybe at this

6042.639 --> 6047.400000000001
point i need to wind it down

6072.0 --> 6074.239
what

6075.199 --> 6078.919999999999
what's going on here

6083.76 --> 6089.679
see sting energy with me i don't exactly

6087.44 --> 6093.5599999999995
know what that means there at

6089.679 --> 6093.56
z sting energy

6099.119 --> 6104.839999999999
i just know that during the full moon i

6101.119 --> 6107.44
was like exhilarated like

6104.84 --> 6109.679
emotionally like almost unnaturally

6107.44 --> 6113.159
happy

6109.679 --> 6113.159
it was weird

6147.04 --> 6150.719
strong intense energy you're right

6151.119 --> 6156.239
yeah yeah there was a lot of energy

6153.119 --> 6157.92
that's why yesterday i i made it my show

6156.239 --> 6160.0
that's what i was talking about there's

6157.92 --> 6162.4800000000005
something

6160.0 --> 6165.679
it's there probably every year but this

6162.48 --> 6168.159
year it was like really

6165.679 --> 6170.159
it was just right there

6168.159 --> 6174.5199999999995
it's still there

6170.159 --> 6174.5199999999995
it's right it's here right now

6176.08 --> 6179.84
right but

6177.92 --> 6182.2390000000005
like this sunday

6179.84 --> 6185.1990000000005
it was really there

6182.239 --> 6186.159
like it's like like i could almost point

6185.199 --> 6189.28
at it

6186.159 --> 6189.28
was that palpable

6193.44 --> 6196.799999999999
it's christ returning that's what i call

6195.44 --> 6198.96
it

6196.8 --> 6201.84
it's that feeling like that magical

6198.96 --> 6204.96
thing like whoa

6201.84 --> 6208.159000000001
something really heavy but good

6204.96 --> 6208.159
like good news

6210.239 --> 6213.879999999999
that kind of sense

6218.4 --> 6225.48
okay it's adam price

6221.84 --> 6225.4800000000005
flat earth dweeb

6239.88 --> 6242.979
[Music]

6249.36 --> 6253.28
yeah

6250.48 --> 6257.04
yeah right back yeah curating the chat

6253.28 --> 6257.04
is it can be very difficult

6257.119 --> 6261.119
but yeah i think there's an

6258.96 --> 6263.44
understanding that everybody curates a

6261.119 --> 6264.639
little themselves

6263.44 --> 6265.678999999999
right

6264.639 --> 6268.400000000001
and then

6265.679 --> 6270.4
yeah everything works out

6268.4 --> 6273.04
everybody's just

6270.4 --> 6275.839999999999
doing their thing and

6273.04 --> 6275.84
paying attention

6279.36 --> 6283.5199999999995
trying to resolve issues wherever they

6281.36 --> 6286.4
may pop up

6283.52 --> 6289.040000000001
make sure everybody learns something

6286.4 --> 6290.638999999999
and then it's a great chat and sometimes

6289.04 --> 6292.639
i don't even follow what's going on

6290.639 --> 6295.04
because i'm very inspired to talk about

6292.639 --> 6295.04
something

6295.36 --> 6299.599999999999
and then still fine because i know that

6297.44 --> 6303.48
you guys wouldn't let like things go

6299.6 --> 6303.4800000000005
grow out of hand or something

6325.119 --> 6332.48
the sun is doing so weird things as of

6328.96 --> 6332.4800000000005
late what do you mean george sanford

6336.639 --> 6341.119
what is christ serious

6338.88 --> 6344.119
everyone has different ideas what's

6341.119 --> 6344.119
yours

6345.44 --> 6350.799999999999
i think christ was

6347.6 --> 6354.719
an amazing man a prophet

6350.8 --> 6354.719
for those that are really into that

6355.44 --> 6358.44
and

6358.48 --> 6363.04
he's like one of the first

6360.8 --> 6366.08
masters to like really lift the veil

6363.04 --> 6369.36
like all ascended masters he was one

6366.08 --> 6372.88
absolutely probably

6369.36 --> 6375.599999999999
the most amazing one to me

6372.88 --> 6377.679
because he

6375.6 --> 6380.88
really cared for the world and

6377.679 --> 6382.08
envisioned like discipline and structure

6380.88 --> 6384.84
virtue

6382.08 --> 6386.4
like the old ways

6384.84 --> 6388.32
reformed

6386.4 --> 6391.5199999999995
like

6388.32 --> 6394.0
he he showed the path

6391.52 --> 6396.56
like this is the way to do it and he

6394.0 --> 6398.84
showed it like this

6396.56 --> 6401.76
just unimaginably long

6398.84 --> 6404.88
ago but it still applies he was a

6401.76 --> 6408.2390000000005
visionary and his vision transcended

6404.88 --> 6410.08
time itself in ways

6408.239 --> 6412.839999999999
and he knew

6410.08 --> 6414.88
like this is how

6412.84 --> 6415.6
we can

6414.88 --> 6419.04
like

6415.6 --> 6423.119000000001
tame this devil that we're all stuck

6419.04 --> 6423.119
with for the rest of creation

6423.28 --> 6429.92
this is how you do it and then

6426.239 --> 6432.718999999999
yeah that was preceded by the devil

6429.92 --> 6434.96
literally encroaching right up to it

6432.719 --> 6436.8
capturing everything about him

6434.96 --> 6439.28
encapsulating him

6436.8 --> 6442.8
and then creating a religion

6439.28 --> 6445.84
that abuses his virtue

6442.8 --> 6448.88
and then plants false ideas about what

6445.84 --> 6451.84
his teachings really are

6448.88 --> 6451.84
and that's what they did

6455.04 --> 6460.08
take the esoterics out of it and i'll

6457.36 --> 6463.92
turn it into this weird

6460.08 --> 6466.719
more physical ritual nonsense

6463.92 --> 6471.719
and just these ideas that are more based

6466.719 --> 6471.719
on peer pressure and just slavery

6474.8 --> 6478.4800000000005
under the guise of supposedly do being

6477.199 --> 6480.08
the opposite

6478.48 --> 6482.4
right

6480.08 --> 6485.5199999999995
so that's what i think about christ now

6482.4 --> 6487.839999999999
christ is since then

6485.52 --> 6490.2390000000005
thanks to his example also in the

6487.84 --> 6493.04
esoteric world in the spirit world is

6490.239 --> 6495.28
just he's like that he's the same as

6493.04 --> 6497.6
what he always was he is that and he

6495.28 --> 6500.32
will for always be that in the spiritual

6497.6 --> 6503.04
realm like jesus christ is there

6500.32 --> 6507.239
he's right there right now

6503.04 --> 6507.239
shining as he always has

6512.719 --> 6516.8
right

6514.159 --> 6518.799999999999
he's there to show you the way just

6516.8 --> 6522.639
gotta look careful and you're gonna

6518.8 --> 6522.639
realize you're in a challenge

6523.119 --> 6526.88
you gotta face your demons you gotta

6524.8 --> 6529.04
face your own unwillingness you gotta

6526.88 --> 6531.1990000000005
face your own sloth you gotta face your

6529.04 --> 6531.199
own

6531.36 --> 6537.44
impulsive rebellious nature when it

6534.639 --> 6540.2390000000005
actually does you no good

6537.44 --> 6541.678999999999
when it makes you stray you're gonna

6540.239 --> 6544.4
learn you're gonna learn everything

6541.679 --> 6548.56
about yourself you gotta master yourself

6544.4 --> 6548.5599999999995
you basically gotta follow in his tracks

6548.719 --> 6552.639
right that's why it's a path of christ

6550.48 --> 6554.4
that's the real one the real

6552.639 --> 6557.28
way to do it

6554.4 --> 6559.44
try to follow his example

6557.28 --> 6561.84
esoterically that doesn't mean every

6559.44 --> 6564.0
single thing to he says to the letter

6561.84 --> 6564.96
and then be like super fundamentalist

6564.0 --> 6568.719
about it

6564.96 --> 6571.76
it just means realize

6568.719 --> 6574.639
the energy of it and why that everything

6571.76 --> 6576.719
that's a sin has a price

6574.639 --> 6579.36
not because somebody's there with like a

6576.719 --> 6581.84
butcher knife or whatever or

6579.36 --> 6585.679
or a firing squad but because of the

6581.84 --> 6588.4800000000005
mechanics of creation itself

6585.679 --> 6590.0
just know understand that it is know

6588.48 --> 6592.48
what is real

6590.0 --> 6595.199
is the key and that and then

6592.48 --> 6598.32
go straight to my esoterics

6595.199 --> 6600.879999999999
truth is god lies are the devil that's

6598.32 --> 6602.88
why it's so important to know what is

6600.88 --> 6603.84
real and to know what is real you have

6602.88 --> 6604.88
to know

6603.84 --> 6608.639
how

6604.88 --> 6610.88
what you are how you work how you think

6608.639 --> 6613.1990000000005
what are your impulses

6610.88 --> 6615.679
do you really

6613.199 --> 6616.96
know and understand your impulses why

6615.679 --> 6621.04
are they there

6616.96 --> 6621.04
why do other people have impulses

6621.679 --> 6627.4400000000005
how can we best arrange what we have in

6625.52 --> 6629.599
order to become the best that we could

6627.44 --> 6629.598999999999
be

6632.159 --> 6638.159
and how do we not get distracted by the

6635.36 --> 6639.44
temptations that come with order and

6638.159 --> 6642.08
power

6639.44 --> 6643.919999999999
right you become better you stand out

6642.08 --> 6646.96
things are going to seduce you power

6643.92 --> 6649.76
itself might seduce you like to be

6646.96 --> 6652.56
a ruler over somebody in some way and

6649.76 --> 6654.719
abuse that power always it's an eternal

6652.56 --> 6656.96
challenge and jesus christ was all about

6654.719 --> 6656.96
that

6657.44 --> 6663.119
he was like the first as a terrorist

6659.92 --> 6665.04
that really tried to explain that

6663.119 --> 6667.04
that factor

6665.04 --> 6669.679
more than any other ascended master in

6667.04 --> 6669.679
my opinion

6671.28 --> 6677.679
to actually tackle it to build with it

6675.04 --> 6680.239
like buddha for example

6677.679 --> 6682.0
also addressed it but his was always to

6680.239 --> 6684.5599999999995
basically like

6682.0 --> 6686.88
don't let it manifest like

6684.56 --> 6688.719
don't even

6686.88 --> 6690.4800000000005
let the earthly

6688.719 --> 6692.88
touch you like that

6690.48 --> 6695.199
and i don't think that like that way you

6692.88 --> 6698.159000000001
don't really

6695.199 --> 6700.719
struggle with the earth you it's less of

6698.159 --> 6703.92
an engagement with the test and it comes

6700.719 --> 6705.44
with its perks i guess it's just not my

6703.92 --> 6707.92
method

6705.44 --> 6709.919999999999
i'm not the boo i'm not a booth buddha

6707.92 --> 6713.28
method methodist

6709.92 --> 6713.28
i'm a christ methodist

6720.96 --> 6724.2390000000005
i believe jesus was anti-religion well

6723.28 --> 6725.0
yeah

6724.239 --> 6728.0
well

6725.0 --> 6729.44
anti-priest athorian authoritarian

6728.0 --> 6731.599
religion right

6729.44 --> 6734.08
that was the point like a church you are

6731.599 --> 6736.159000000001
the church where people gather in his

6734.08 --> 6737.599
name

6736.159 --> 6739.119
right not

6737.599 --> 6740.639
some

6739.119 --> 6742.32
like weirdo

6740.639 --> 6745.36
creepy

6742.32 --> 6749.04
probably gay probably pedo person with

6745.36 --> 6751.679
fancy hat and a golden staff or whatever

6749.04 --> 6754.4
like that's not the one you should seek

6751.679 --> 6756.08
out for a spirit to advise that was like

6754.4 --> 6758.879999999999
his point

6756.08 --> 6762.08
like the priesthood be wary of the

6758.88 --> 6764.96
priesthood of those that claim

6762.08 --> 6768.32
like divine authority

6764.96 --> 6771.44
have your own divine authority

6768.32 --> 6773.599
from inside from god

6771.44 --> 6778.5199999999995
and then everybody will reflect on it

6773.599 --> 6778.52
through the law given by god

6790.4 --> 6794.879999999999
what is a sin then sex smoking herb

6792.88 --> 6796.32
anger

6794.88 --> 6799.76
no

6796.32 --> 6803.92
those things separate separated gunmet

6799.76 --> 6804.719
gun gum nut man are not sins

6803.92 --> 6807.76
it's

6804.719 --> 6810.4
how how do you apply it

6807.76 --> 6812.2390000000005
that would make them a sin right

6810.4 --> 6814.799999999999
it those all those things are

6812.239 --> 6817.678999999999
engagements things that you do well what

6814.8 --> 6819.360000000001
do you do with them

6817.679 --> 6822.96
why do you have sex

6819.36 --> 6825.5199999999995
do you just have sex for pleasure

6822.96 --> 6828.08
and you don't give a [ __ ]

6825.52 --> 6832.080000000001
are you smoking herb just to get really

6828.08 --> 6835.199
stoned to forget about whatever you were

6832.08 --> 6839.679
worried about or something

6835.199 --> 6841.598999999999
why are you angry you just wanna squirt

6839.679 --> 6842.4800000000005
no matter your damage

6841.599 --> 6844.56
right

6842.48 --> 6846.799999999999
that would make it a sin

6844.56 --> 6851.080000000001
but all those things can also be

6846.8 --> 6851.08
utilized very constructively

6851.679 --> 6855.36
and then they're not a sin

6854.239 --> 6858.08
because

6855.36 --> 6860.639
the real sin is in

6858.08 --> 6864.159
the choice making you see

6860.639 --> 6868.639
the sin is not the substance the sin

6864.159 --> 6871.598999999999
is the choice making in relation to it

6868.639 --> 6873.119
why do you do it

6871.599 --> 6876.92
what do you do

6873.119 --> 6876.92
why do you do it

6877.04 --> 6881.119
how like or well what are you doing how

6879.84 --> 6883.04
is it

6881.119 --> 6884.48
impacting you right

6883.04 --> 6886.48
i mean

6884.48 --> 6888.839999999999
there's people that smoke

6886.48 --> 6892.08
like like tobacco

6888.84 --> 6893.679
smokers that are like really like oh

6892.08 --> 6895.92
they love it and they're like crushing

6893.679 --> 6898.159
it right they smoke and they do great

6895.92 --> 6900.719
things and they they're badass and that

6898.159 --> 6902.239
they're really kind of badass right

6900.719 --> 6904.8
there's probably not a lot of those

6902.239 --> 6906.5599999999995
people still left around especially in

6904.8 --> 6908.159000000001
the early 20th century there was a whole

6906.56 --> 6911.1990000000005
bunch of people that really used that

6908.159 --> 6912.879999999999
smoking cigar and they were bad asses

6911.199 --> 6915.199
they really were

6912.88 --> 6916.400000000001
and it did that for them right well then

6915.199 --> 6917.759999999999
it's not

6916.4 --> 6920.5599999999995
really a sin

6917.76 --> 6923.679
but if you're like smoking because your

6920.56 --> 6925.76
anxiety and you're like

6923.679 --> 6927.04
forget about it get over excited or

6925.76 --> 6930.88
whatever

6927.04 --> 6934.239
well then you're using it like a drug

6930.88 --> 6937.599
to to combat a problem that you should

6934.239 --> 6938.799999999999
probably deal more head-on

6937.599 --> 6941.52
somehow

6938.8 --> 6943.360000000001
or rearrange your life so you don't get

6941.52 --> 6947.92
into that position because it's really

6943.36 --> 6951.598999999999
unhealthy to smoke like because you're

6947.92 --> 6952.4
yeah because of anxiety or something

6951.599 --> 6954.719
right

6952.4 --> 6957.36
then it becomes a sin because of the

6954.719 --> 6959.44
consequences of how you're doing it it's

6957.36 --> 6960.96
how are you doing it

6959.44 --> 6963.04
that can really

6960.96 --> 6965.679
make something bad for you

6963.04 --> 6970.08
so in the end the intention

6965.679 --> 6970.08
is a very important factor to sin

6970.48 --> 6974.5599999999995
and the funny thing is is that there we

6972.56 --> 6976.96
have sensories the spiritually well

6974.56 --> 6978.88
developed have sensories

6976.96 --> 6981.44
with their own spirit where you can

6978.88 --> 6982.56
sense what's the intention of this

6981.44 --> 6984.719
person

6982.56 --> 6987.119000000001
why what's their frequency their

6984.719 --> 6989.119
intention will set their frequency we'll

6987.119 --> 6990.639
set how things roll out what their

6989.119 --> 6992.88
tactics will be

6990.639 --> 6994.88
see

6992.88 --> 6997.36
so that's where really where you find

6994.88 --> 7000.56
this in

6997.36 --> 7002.48
it's not just a substance an action no

7000.56 --> 7005.599
it's how are you doing it

7002.48 --> 7006.799999999999
how is it affecting you

7005.599 --> 7008.639
right

7006.8 --> 7010.96
the real sin

7008.639 --> 7013.679
is a downward path is a path of

7010.96 --> 7017.04
ruination is where things go wrong

7013.679 --> 7020.0
if you keep doing that you ruin yourself

7017.04 --> 7020.96
because it's a path of sin

7020.0 --> 7023.92
you can

7020.96 --> 7025.679
notice it that is ruining you when when

7023.92 --> 7027.1990000000005
you engage with that

7025.679 --> 7029.52
right

7027.199 --> 7032.5599999999995
that's how you know

7029.52 --> 7035.52
it's like you can't sin

7032.56 --> 7037.92
and not realize it

7035.52 --> 7039.92
unless you're like so head strong and

7037.92 --> 7042.88
obsessed that you just don't see

7039.92 --> 7045.4400000000005
anything anymore right but if you if

7042.88 --> 7047.92
you're not like that and you keep on a

7045.44 --> 7051.119
path of sin you know it

7047.92 --> 7053.1990000000005
sinners know it because you can feel it

7051.119 --> 7056.199
when it's really a sin you can't escape

7053.199 --> 7056.199
it

7058.719 --> 7062.8
and you have to figure out how to deal

7060.48 --> 7062.799999999999
with it

7062.88 --> 7066.88
when that happens

7064.719 --> 7069.119
you can do something as a sin or you can

7066.88 --> 7071.4400000000005
do it not as a sin

7069.119 --> 7072.639
but you can't force

7071.44 --> 7074.159
that

7072.639 --> 7076.159000000001
way right

7074.159 --> 7077.92
it's like oh there's times that i can

7076.159 --> 7080.5599999999995
smoke and it's great

7077.92 --> 7082.719
and then there's times where i just want

7080.56 --> 7086.0
that great moment back so i'm gonna

7082.719 --> 7087.36
force it and then it doesn't work and

7086.0 --> 7091.119
that's a sin

7087.36 --> 7094.08
because you forced it to come back

7091.119 --> 7096.799999999999
you want to force it to come back

7094.08 --> 7099.199
that's a sin

7096.8 --> 7100.639
just let it naturally happen if you

7099.199 --> 7103.119
don't get it

7100.639 --> 7105.84
then don't get obsessed with the great

7103.119 --> 7107.839999999999
times that you when you did get it

7105.84 --> 7109.1990000000005
because if you do

7107.84 --> 7111.599
you'll start

7109.199 --> 7113.44
like lusting obsessing

7111.599 --> 7117.76
escapism

7113.44 --> 7117.759999999999
sin that's where the sin comes in

7156.88 --> 7161.1990000000005
the feeling of whatever i'm doing

7161.28 --> 7166.159
it's an amplifier to me

7166.159 --> 7170.32
empathetical senses my sensories in

7168.48 --> 7171.678999999999
