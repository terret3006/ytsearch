8.91 --> 43.14
[Music]

39.26 --> 47.55

43.14 --> 51.629000000000005
early-bird number 105 I'm your host

47.55 --> 55.199
Arwen and today it's an interesting day

51.629 --> 57.059
it's warm again very warm and even

55.199 --> 62.099999999999994
though they've been came trailing all

57.059 --> 65.12899999999999
over the place morning and even seem to

62.1 --> 70.35
try to continue doing it right now it's

65.129 --> 77.429
still very beautiful blue and warm it's

70.35 --> 80.22
just so warm look at that yeah cloudy

77.429 --> 81.81
here and there so could you imagine what

80.22 --> 84.74
it would have been like if they hadn't

81.81 --> 84.74000000000001
chemtrails at all

98.439 --> 101.939
yeah awesome

104.46 --> 113.88
well yeah I'm gonna have a guess on who

109.14 --> 116.27
is a first appearance yes I don't know

113.88 --> 118.67999999999999
when he's coming on but he should be

116.27 --> 126.17999999999999
trying to get on anytime

118.68 --> 129.53
we'll see I have a lot she says huh so

126.18 --> 131.94
let's start off with that amazing

129.53 --> 137.34
presentation that Karen beaded last

131.94 --> 138.09
night well yeah that was really

137.34 --> 142.53
impressive

138.09 --> 145.02
hey okay right uh okay I guess I'm not

142.53 --> 151.68
gonna start out with that yeah Casey

145.02 --> 153.75
Jones added me and I recognized the hawk

151.68 --> 156.5
face I think I've seen you around

153.75 --> 163.44
sometime

156.5 --> 167.459
hello yeah I do

163.44 --> 171.48
I'm doing really good really really good

167.459 --> 173.03
today there's not a right moment all

171.48 --> 178.97
right

173.03 --> 182.88
woman who you're kinda late right yeah

178.97 --> 185.519
crazy day yesterday again so much stuff

182.88 --> 188.269
happening at the same time I got a

185.519 --> 192.239
little wine added with that and then

188.269 --> 193.56
yeah literally went had a dance party

192.239 --> 197.04
here all by myself

193.56 --> 197.7
and in the morning I woke up realized oh

197.04 --> 199.94
[ __ ]

197.7 --> 205.709
I had so much fun and it was all alone

199.94 --> 208.019
damnit where the lady said but I'd still

205.709 --> 212.1
had great fun yesterday evening really

208.019 --> 213.93
good Friday evening good music and that

212.1 --> 214.85999999999999
presentation of Karen B was so

213.93 --> 217.89000000000001
impressive

214.86 --> 221.61
and also have you heard this crazy rumor

217.89 --> 225.95
now that a rumor it apparently happened

221.61 --> 225.95000000000002
that the guy that criticized

226.03 --> 234.01
so I'm losing my words here guy that was

231.76 --> 239.76
making all these meta accusations about

234.01 --> 243.57999999999998
how flat earthers can't improve the ball

239.76 --> 246.94
and then Nathan I was on that made like

243.58 --> 249.75
a pretty hardcore video response to that

246.94 --> 253.42
and that guy deleted his channel

249.75 --> 255.16
Gary awesome that's what that's who's

253.42 --> 256.47999999999996
against the feminists and everything and

255.16 --> 260.29
he should have really stuck to that

256.48 --> 265.72
because he deleted his channel like all

260.29 --> 267.28000000000003
the videos are gone and he's been added

265.72 --> 275.20000000000005
for a year so that's like pretty

267.28 --> 278.59
dramatic so sorry what did he did it he

275.2 --> 281.59
was before mainly purely focusing on

278.59 --> 285.01
social justice warrior feminists which

281.59 --> 287.85999999999996
is pretty straight forward target pretty

285.01 --> 292.15
easy I guess and then he decided to put

287.86 --> 294.07
flat earthers on the same thing he had

292.15 --> 298.06
ridicule for them then he approached us

294.07 --> 300.36
and then yeah as rant he putted quite

298.06 --> 307.6
eloquently with an image of the Hulk

300.36 --> 309.79
smashing was again low-key with his face

307.6 --> 314.74
that was perfect because yeah you

309.79 --> 318.64000000000004
thought oh yeah I can take that no no

314.74 --> 324.01
and now within 12 hours all the content

318.64 --> 329.229
on this channel is gone so it probably

324.01 --> 331.95
did like a depression self delete which

329.229 --> 334.03
is not really even necessary it's just

331.95 --> 336.03999999999996
kind of tragic actually

334.03 --> 338.38
because yeah he put so much work and all

336.04 --> 341.5
that whether he be an idiot or not and

338.38 --> 342.36
then to just you know in a flash moment

341.5 --> 346.41
deleted all

342.36 --> 348.259
you can't get it back once you do that

346.41 --> 354.569
[Music]

348.259 --> 360.41900000000004
but yeah you got burns badly so have you

354.569 --> 363.18
seen any of that on the feed but I don't

360.419 --> 365.4
really I mean I do follow a lot of I do

363.18 --> 368.159
follow a lot of channels I got necessary

365.4 --> 370.65
watching more I tend to sort of like

368.159 --> 374.159
stick to sort of like I mean I'll do

370.65 --> 376.94899999999996
what Slayton every day films grow

374.159 --> 379.8
Buster's but is it it seems to be like

376.949 --> 383.159
quite repetitive information right on

379.8 --> 385.949
most of most champion Party CCP like the

383.159 --> 387.629
same sort of stuff and you know I'm just

385.949 --> 389.52000000000004
trying I just like myself to a couple

387.629 --> 393.509
channels otherwise it gets to be too a

389.52 --> 395.639
bit too like say too much yeah a little

393.509 --> 398.069
bit bit too much and it's all you

395.639 --> 400.139
arguing and all it all it all all you

398.069 --> 402.33000000000004
fighting and you know you got further

400.139 --> 405.0
from one side and another photo from the

402.33 --> 407.039
other side the other side it's like it

405.0 --> 409.139
just seems to be so much divided right

407.039 --> 411.81
as it's gone on you know expert as

409.139 --> 413.039
flatterfit dependent I feel like it's

411.81 --> 416.129
got more divided

413.039 --> 418.349
I don't know where the nest by with this

416.129 --> 421.22900000000004
boy more informations come out and he'd

418.349 --> 423.659
work on two separate ways or or they're

421.229 --> 426.389
taking their own theories right here

423.659 --> 427.74
like themselves to like to each corner

426.389 --> 429.569
so they call the crowd

427.74 --> 432.419
in one corner what believing that type

429.569 --> 432.839
open another crowd or even another type

432.419 --> 435.33
of flair

432.839 --> 437.19
it just seems to be and I sort of sit on

435.33 --> 439.77
the fence a lot you know I just watch

437.19 --> 443.669
you all I mean I've slowly digested how

439.77 --> 445.469
I had how I feel like it like in my mind

443.669 --> 447.33
you know I mean like whether there's a

445.469 --> 450.089
wall where there's a nice wall where it

447.33 --> 450.81
is the dome really sorry a plain earth

450.089 --> 453.479
our planet

450.81 --> 455.879
I'm like a plane which just goes on

453.479 --> 458.339
forever and ever and ever and every test

455.879 --> 460.62
line is buddy's business this is so much

458.339 --> 464.219
you know it's hard to sort you know

460.62 --> 467.159
decide for yourself what it is well

464.219 --> 469.639
should we even decide because what we're

467.159 --> 472.11
doing is basically a form of new

469.639 --> 474.96000000000004
presuppositional exploration

472.11 --> 478.98
because yeah we don't know these details

474.96 --> 481.59
of what is out there so we can only try

478.98 --> 484.20000000000005
to figure out what could be this is what

481.59 --> 486.06
I've been doing like since the start and

484.2 --> 488.67
basically pointing out like all the

486.06 --> 491.7
possibilities and I try to go very far

488.67 --> 495.45
with that into even what to most people

491.7 --> 497.58
will be the surreal claiming special

495.45 --> 501.81
non-linearity and the looping factor and

497.58 --> 504.06
all that but yeah don't make a choice

501.81 --> 505.92
you don't need to make a choice this is

504.06 --> 509.46
a misconception you don't need to make a

505.92 --> 513.35
choice and that science the globe

509.46 --> 523.9499999999999
science makes a choice a narrative is

513.35 --> 529.26
one of their fundamental mistakes you

523.95 --> 532.2900000000001
lose the details I mean you just don't

529.26 --> 534.27
know where where there is a you know you

532.29 --> 536.76
know where are people call me the silent

534.27 --> 540.3
man it's only flatter fit side up it's a

536.76 --> 543.3
distraction and then you look at all

540.3 --> 545.16
life it's Adam it's a sign up and a

543.3 --> 547.68
distraction from the lies that's correct

545.16 --> 549.36
I mean what do you what do you what do

547.68 --> 551.76
you feel about operation fishbowl

549.36 --> 553.74
we never when they were shooting nuclear

551.76 --> 556.41
weapons into the you dirty thought line

553.74 --> 560.3100000000001
to the sky you know like like why why

556.41 --> 564.41
call it fishbowl traffic from the fact

560.31 --> 569.13
that it never happened what I would do

564.41 --> 571.26
yeah I know I'll really like what like

569.13 --> 574.86
what evidence do we have that nukes

571.26 --> 577.68
really exist that's the point it's a

574.86 --> 580.41
distraction to distract from that it

577.68 --> 589.3499999999999
never happened might making not too

580.41 --> 593.8199999999999
interesting to ignore it real psyops are

589.35 --> 596.07
very complex and powerful and the more

593.82 --> 598.47
distracting it is the more likely it's

596.07 --> 600.7800000000001
actually the distracting factor the

598.47 --> 603.8100000000001
interesting factor is there to cover up

600.78 --> 606.43
that it's actually absolutely nothing

603.81 --> 609.2099999999999
that the foundations of it is that

606.43 --> 612.7299999999999
nothing really happened at all it's pure

609.21 --> 614.98
written fiction III starting to figure

612.73 --> 618.25
this out more and more and it's slapping

614.98 --> 621.94
me in the face hard every time I get

618.25 --> 626.59
confronted with this because it's it

621.94 --> 629.7700000000001
seems to be routed in a lot of things in

626.59 --> 633.4300000000001
the news works in in propaganda they're

629.77 --> 636.31
just things that are put into a context

633.43 --> 641.9799999999999
taken out of proportion and then that's

636.31 --> 644.38
kept that way permanently it's not

641.98 --> 646.33
refined down to over right maybe

644.38 --> 649.48
actually this really happened no they

646.33 --> 653.5300000000001
keep that out of proportion narrative

649.48 --> 657.76
they're permanently it's programmed like

653.53 --> 659.92
this is the format and they do this a

657.76 --> 663.7
lot and I think that they have been

659.92 --> 667.03
doing this even into the not-too-distant

663.7 --> 670.21
past as well with for example things

667.03 --> 675.31
like operation fish oil ball I think it

670.21 --> 678.88
never happened it's called Operation

675.31 --> 680.5899999999999
fishbowl fishbowl is a perfect

678.88 --> 683.65
distraction because it points at

680.59 --> 686.8000000000001
something else that is really

683.65 --> 690.6999999999999
interesting like do they know it's a

686.8 --> 694.68
fishbowl they're basically trying to

690.7 --> 699.22
write on the upcoming meme of Flat Earth

694.68 --> 701.8
very far thought out taking cover on

699.22 --> 702.22
under something that's gonna come in the

701.8 --> 706.39
future

702.22 --> 708.6600000000001
MAGIX it's surreal but I think they do

706.39 --> 708.66
it

709.97 --> 714.919
yeah this interesting goodbye yeah God

713.149 --> 716.749
when you get into front empty start it's

714.919 --> 718.759
funny because they're the first things

716.749 --> 721.6990000000001
you come across so you come across all

718.759 --> 725.389
those types of own well conspiracies you

721.699 --> 727.269
know punchy fishbowl and you know those

725.389 --> 730.609
types of things seem to come along with

727.269 --> 733.4590000000001
if you start searching for it so it like

730.609 --> 737.3290000000001
if they're not true and they are just as

733.459 --> 739.059
far out as a dude I didn't mean

737.329 --> 742.909
everything else is a cover as well

739.059 --> 745.929
well a cover up look if something is not

742.909 --> 749.029
true it's not always a cover up

745.929 --> 754.7289999999999
sometimes it's just there to make a

749.029 --> 757.159
story to be part of a story of or part

754.729 --> 760.9390000000001
of an attempt to convince people that a

757.159 --> 763.939
certain thing is real it may not be

760.939 --> 766.879
routed in the actual event itself the

763.939 --> 769.309
event may just be a byproduct of the

766.879 --> 774.1990000000001
long term strategy of trying to convince

769.309 --> 776.149
people something is real and it doesn't

774.199 --> 777.829
cost a lot to do it because you don't

776.149 --> 780.559
have to you have to do anything you just

777.829 --> 783.8789999999999
have to write the stories and make them

780.559 --> 786.529
convincing and plan them out carefully

783.879 --> 790.099
it's relatively cheap even to do that

786.529 --> 791.499
and yet you can program half or the

790.099 --> 795.8290000000001
entire world

791.499 --> 801.8190000000001
for decades or potentially a century

795.829 --> 808.459
with just few actions it's genius and

801.819 --> 810.909
insidious as well but yeah I'm jumping

808.459 --> 810.909
way ahead

814.189 --> 825.889
anyway yeah anything else I'm like

818.579 --> 830.789
breaking in there you know just know I

825.889 --> 833.069
it seems to me like otherwise [ __ ] you

830.789 --> 834.8389999999999
you know well talking to you on skype

833.069 --> 837.059
what did she like that about the planets

834.839 --> 838.849
like these things I see severe flat

837.059 --> 841.4689999999999
earth for you have to you have to deny

838.849 --> 844.589
that all that it all that is not true

841.469 --> 847.1590000000001
you know that is just I do not tangible

844.589 --> 849.7790000000001
objects it's just been like since fire

847.159 --> 852.0889999999999
so when they show you all the photos of

849.779 --> 853.429
all two Rovers going over wherever

852.089 --> 855.899
they're going

853.429 --> 859.379
you know what I personally think that

855.899 --> 861.149
they are by their clothes they're not

859.379 --> 861.629
they're not the distance that they say

861.149 --> 864.839
they are

861.629 --> 866.4590000000001
oh we've been our confinement but

864.839 --> 868.4390000000001
they've got obviously I think they've

866.459 --> 872.069
got technology to start to get to these

868.439 --> 874.4689999999999
poses which which we don't obviously get

872.069 --> 878.9889999999999
told about and I think they if they are

874.469 --> 882.119
on the up in other than ie just makes

878.989 --> 884.159
flat bit more doubtful so you're

882.119 --> 887.8090000000001
convinced that there is another location

884.159 --> 893.099
outside of our known world

887.809 --> 896.159
oh yeah yeah I think there's I thought

893.099 --> 898.6790000000001
the everything spy fake no you know I

896.159 --> 901.679
think there is these things up there

898.679 --> 904.199
where I are you know if it's a space

901.679 --> 905.669
program it could be a space program it

904.199 --> 909.8389999999999
was a space probably many many years ago

905.669 --> 912.569
apparently you know other than for me if

909.839 --> 915.479
I if you get there on they are on these

912.569 --> 921.0889999999999
planets and these paths are clearly a

915.479 --> 923.759
spear shape it's in my head I'll get

921.089 --> 926.849
there big cookie yeah

923.759 --> 929.039
it's problematic because it sends you

926.849 --> 932.999
all into spherical thinking but the

929.039 --> 934.889
problem is when you deal with the real

932.999 --> 936.479
science and when you get down to the

934.889 --> 939.3290000000001
Flat Earth debate level kind of thing

936.479 --> 942.869
you figure out that that is just

939.329 --> 944.78
technically impossible can never be

942.869 --> 947.4200000000001
can't work that way

944.78 --> 950.0899999999999
sure there may be some hidden land

947.42 --> 953.81
beyond somewhere or even underneath us

950.09 --> 958.4300000000001
or some other mystery but the way they

953.81 --> 963.31
proposed it to be can never be it's just

958.43 --> 966.05
basically impossible but who knows maybe

963.31 --> 968.54
yeah some point you bump into the

966.05 --> 971.8399999999999
ceiling or something you know maybe

968.54 --> 974.42
they're floating platforms up there at

971.84 --> 977.4200000000001
some point when it gets super cold and

974.42 --> 980.5999999999999
there's just a mysterious other surreal

977.42 --> 984.65
realm out there and maybe really deep

980.6 --> 988.25
down there is giant caves that could fit

984.65 --> 993.02
entire continents you don't know you

988.25 --> 995.54
don't know for sure I mean it's not much

993.02 --> 997.1899999999999
talk about Antarctica and I find that

995.54 --> 999.02
really really really interesting I think

997.19 --> 1001.57
I think that all the flattery Antarctica

999.02 --> 1004.48
seems to be the only place on earth that

1001.57 --> 1006.0400000000001
you know we just can't get to you know

1004.48 --> 1007.8100000000001
you can you know you can see the

1006.04 --> 1010.0
Penguins you can go and see the coastal

1007.81 --> 1011.68
line on some parts of it but you know

1010.0 --> 1013.6
there's not much talk about Antarctica I

1011.68 --> 1015.76
like the happy life I think I think I

1013.6 --> 1019.03
think that's the key to further I think

1015.76 --> 1021.79
I've amazed Acadia if for me anyway if I

1019.03 --> 1023.86
was to truly believe it lie for myself I

1021.79 --> 1027.9389999999999
think of Antarctica Holmes Holmes the

1023.86 --> 1031.949
host okay well if it's too much about it

1027.939 --> 1036.699
it certainly does hold a key it is a

1031.949 --> 1040.41
step that will yeah absolutely progress

1036.699 --> 1043.449
our knowledge on which we base our

1040.41 --> 1045.88
concepts so you can rule out certain

1043.449 --> 1049.42
things and everything yeah there is a

1045.88 --> 1052.48
barrier it's not even the end of it you

1049.42 --> 1055.3600000000001
know I found it really interesting but

1052.48 --> 1057.49
they just nothing really covers it much

1055.36 --> 1060.31
you know every I mean at the moment is

1057.49 --> 1061.57
its observations you know I think it'd

1060.31 --> 1063.8799999999999
be wrong it's brilliant you know you can

1061.57 --> 1065.3799999999999
see things far away and should be seeing

1063.88 --> 1067.21
things and I understand what Megan's

1065.38 --> 1070.0900000000001
always banging on about you just see it

1067.21 --> 1073.39
but you know how many observations fire

1070.09 --> 1076.36
I think that's gonna prove completely

1073.39 --> 1079.6000000000001
completely turn someone into 5 into 5

1076.36 --> 1081.6699999999998
I think that you need more anymore

1079.6 --> 1084.1
evidence to prove you know to completely

1081.67 --> 1087.3400000000001
turn someone but it's just one part

1084.1 --> 1089.4399999999998
it's just one part there's so much you

1087.34 --> 1093.58
know you got the entire housekeeping

1089.44 --> 1096.43
list it's just one one part and look

1093.58 --> 1100.33
there is that there is real indication

1096.43 --> 1103.5700000000002
that it's not physical because yeah

1100.33 --> 1105.6899999999998
why is there no star footage from hiya

1103.57 --> 1111.07
boys why don't you see anything why do

1105.69 --> 1116.17
the moon and the Sun all Bend away that

1111.07 --> 1118.3
kind of thing the whole aspect that if

1116.17 --> 1123.43
you yeah

1118.3 --> 1127.36
if you move vertically radio that lights

1123.43 --> 1130.45
will actually Bend significantly in

1127.36 --> 1133.57
relation to that vertical position is

1130.45 --> 1136.69
such a heavy hitter that they're not

1133.57 --> 1138.61
physically in a literal location that

1136.69 --> 1141.3700000000001
they're just pure optical phenomena

1138.61 --> 1144.82
because physical literal located objects

1141.37 --> 1147.1599999999999
don't behave that way yeah first one

1144.82 --> 1149.53
side huh that's why I love with these

1147.16 --> 1152.0500000000002
British long-distance my observations I

1149.53 --> 1154.09
think there's it's not just clear-cut as

1152.05 --> 1156.58
Nathan said waving just says oh you see

1154.09 --> 1159.1899999999998
it we just see it no I think there's

1156.58 --> 1161.32
more going on because of the distance or

1159.19 --> 1162.94
people are looking at and and I think

1161.32 --> 1166.1799999999998
there's optical definitely optical

1162.94 --> 1168.31
things going on and that's why I get

1166.18 --> 1170.8
very skeptical on on long distance

1168.31 --> 1172.75
observations because you know you like

1170.8 --> 1176.35
and can do some Saphir all sorts of

1172.75 --> 1177.91
things then you know where we can bend

1176.35 --> 1182.11
up or bend down or where we can freeze

1177.91 --> 1186.19
things up is the influence over a

1182.11 --> 1188.7099999999998
distance of yeah of the medium you're

1186.19 --> 1192.67
looking through yes he goes so much

1188.71 --> 1194.26
other stuff going on you know so so

1192.67 --> 1196.18
you've got things could be will be very

1194.26 --> 1199.03
tiny but I really like these photos

1196.18 --> 1202.45
amazing you know I upside-down doing all

1199.03 --> 1206.619
sorts of bending and we're stuffed ah

1202.45 --> 1208.69
then honest it makes me a bit more a bit

1206.619 --> 1210.399
skeptical or just they don't sign war I

1208.69 --> 1216.039
can see that and the 30 miles away there

1210.399 --> 1219.2489999999998
is no I don't think that's enough all

1216.039 --> 1222.73
right well there's always more look the

1219.249 --> 1225.609
globe religion is very tenacious it's

1222.73 --> 1227.19
based on psychological needs of human

1225.609 --> 1230.619
beings it is made

1227.19 --> 1232.8690000000001
it's basically subtracted from our own

1230.619 --> 1237.009
needs it is made to be like the perfect

1232.869 --> 1240.85
religion so was designed by the devil

1237.009 --> 1243.57
himself you could even say so it's very

1240.85 --> 1246.039
nations and yeah they will of course

1243.57 --> 1248.23
even the more proof we get is Flat Earth

1246.039 --> 1249.82
is the more they will move on or even

1248.23 --> 1254.379
the more beautiful their stories will

1249.82 --> 1256.629
become to not lose that to not give that

1254.379 --> 1259.029
up that's the function what they're

1256.629 --> 1260.98
gonna be pursuing and I you're actually

1259.029 --> 1265.57
seeing this they're trying something now

1260.98 --> 1267.879
trying to get some more consistency into

1265.57 --> 1270.609
the physics of it all and that is

1267.879 --> 1272.7389999999998
admirable to me find that very

1270.609 --> 1276.059
interesting that they're now recognizing

1272.739 --> 1280.299
okay yeah the Earth's atmosphere

1276.059 --> 1283.6589999999999
gradient is in a certain way we must

1280.299 --> 1285.879
draw specific deduced conclusions from

1283.659 --> 1288.159
this in our presuppositional models and

1285.879 --> 1290.08
thus must conclude that the moon is in

1288.159 --> 1292.2990000000002
the atmosphere of the earth because

1290.08 --> 1294.82
there's no other way and that brings all

1292.299 --> 1297.46
kinds of new data complexities old

1294.82 --> 1301.21
errors they now have to try to rub away

1297.46 --> 1301.98
some house and it's yeah better late

1301.21 --> 1304.659
than never

1301.98 --> 1308.24
that's that's my opinion about that and

1304.659 --> 1310.3700000000001
it's gonna be interesting

1308.24 --> 1315.89
and it's not the end of it there's more

1310.37 --> 1320.78
like this I mean the moondust name

1315.89 --> 1322.2800000000002
definitely the moon you know that that's

1320.78 --> 1326.8999999999999
some people can be explored a bit more

1322.28 --> 1330.01
but that's yeah Vanessa first house a

1326.9 --> 1330.01
few caves as well the thing

1332.81 --> 1341.8999999999999
yeah I've been drowning this morning in

1337.28 --> 1344.0
memes it's crazy there was it's been

1341.9 --> 1345.65
happening for a couple of days now like

1344.0 --> 1347.38
people are really catching on to the

1345.65 --> 1349.7
main thing it's being in almost

1347.38 --> 1354.0500000000002
industrialized now it's kind of creepy

1349.7 --> 1357.41
in a way but yeah I have meme powers in

1354.05 --> 1359.3
me and they triggered it and I got so

1357.41 --> 1364.03
many ideas now I already started of

1359.3 --> 1369.11
course with hashtag meifa which I will

1364.03 --> 1372.2
perpetuate and I will get a cap with

1369.11 --> 1374.7199999999998
hashtag meifa on it and I will send it

1372.2 --> 1382.52
to mark Sargent and ask you where it on

1374.72 --> 1385.55
the show you know right ok well that's

1382.52 --> 1389.18
up to the persons that person that's

1385.55 --> 1389.6
asking that's a trick it's I love this

1389.18 --> 1390.92
[ __ ]

1389.6 --> 1394.49
it's multi-dimensional it's

1390.92 --> 1397.79
multi-layered that's my thing I love it

1394.49 --> 1401.48
so if a regular person asked what does

1397.79 --> 1405.92
me fast and for yeah I can say ok make

1401.48 --> 1408.65
earth free again you know I'm very in

1405.92 --> 1412.25
this day is very of this time yellow

1408.65 --> 1414.5600000000002
fast stuff you know you get it like

1412.25 --> 1417.23
who's gonna object to that really except

1414.56 --> 1420.62
if you're a total [ __ ] or social

1417.23 --> 1423.23
justice warrior or whatever and yeah if

1420.62 --> 1425.56
there are conspiracy theorist or like a

1423.23 --> 1428.43
smarter type person

1425.56 --> 1432.81
yeah you could consider telling them the

1428.43 --> 1432.8100000000002
underlayer of that guess what that is

1435.06 --> 1446.29
can you guess what room all right

1438.61 --> 1448.4199999999998
make earth flat again right if you do it

1446.29 --> 1450.82
really right then you have a cap with

1448.42 --> 1455.95
nifa on it and then on the inside you

1450.82 --> 1461.1699999999998
have a print of the Flat Earth discs to

1455.95 --> 1464.26
show it off so yeah it's like you can be

1461.17 --> 1466.51
a flat earther under cover basically in

1464.26 --> 1468.87
plain sight and I love that I love the

1466.51 --> 1468.87
concept

1473.13 --> 1480.16
spread the word I will be at some point

1476.89 --> 1481.99
be a mean merchandise sales men okay

1480.16 --> 1483.6100000000001
yeah I'm gonna do it not because I want

1481.99 --> 1484.24
to make money but because I want my

1483.61 --> 1488.26
memes

1484.24 --> 1492.85
I want my memes out there to control you

1488.26 --> 1494.83
all yeah and I got some more memes for

1492.85 --> 1496.33
you I'm gonna present one and I'm

1494.83 --> 1500.62
actually considering getting on a

1496.33 --> 1504.1899999999998
t-shirt and I just have to share it it's

1500.62 --> 1508.1499999999999
so basic but that's that's the powerful

1504.19 --> 1511.3300000000002
thing about it it's like the more basic

1508.15 --> 1514.2
the meme the more powerful especially if

1511.33 --> 1516.9099999999999
despite its basicness it has

1514.2 --> 1521.02
multi-dimensional meaning I love that

1516.91 --> 1523.27
crap so let's see I'm gonna present this

1521.02 --> 1530.09
I think I'm gonna present it through my

1523.27 --> 1534.23
screen so

1530.09 --> 1534.23
can you see that yeah

1538.149 --> 1548.4689999999998
so tell me guys in chat what do you

1542.649 --> 1553.539
think about that if you can see what's

1548.469 --> 1557.909
going on or I'm gonna have to present it

1553.539 --> 1557.9089999999999
in a more heavy way

1562.59 --> 1565.79
and then not guys

1571.23 --> 1578.47
right for those yeah it's just a stick

1574.3 --> 1582.1299999999999
man basic pencil drawing by me but yeah

1578.47 --> 1585.79
if you look carefully you can see yeah

1582.13 --> 1587.8300000000002
there is the logo which is gonna be the

1585.79 --> 1592.8999999999999
logo what's the meaning of this

1587.83 --> 1596.37
yep I did that I actually Google it it

1592.9 --> 1602.8000000000002
doesn't exist out there yet so it's mine

1596.37 --> 1604.36
copyright Arwen right okay so yeah if

1602.8 --> 1607.21
you look carefully there's two figures

1604.36 --> 1612.4599999999998
here sending your let's try to get this

1607.21 --> 1622.1200000000001
better more complete screen because this

1612.46 --> 1625.48
is not good enough yeah let's just do it

1622.12 --> 1627.6499999999999
like this no more chat and that doesn't

1625.48 --> 1634.29
help damn it

1627.65 --> 1638.66
wait maybe I can just enlarge hold on

1634.29 --> 1638.6599999999999
guys this is gonna be

1650.409 --> 1655.25
sorry for taking so long I'm just gonna

1653.12 --> 1659.529
enlarge it a bit so you can see this

1655.25 --> 1664.779
better right on the left you see a

1659.529 --> 1671.57
smirking big-headed guy holding a

1664.779 --> 1675.409
classic yeah fish ball prop off the flat

1671.57 --> 1677.059
earth like like yeah marks Arjun has one

1675.409 --> 1679.6100000000001
of these and there's this guy making

1677.059 --> 1682.37
these things it's just the model with

1679.61 --> 1684.799
the lights the Sun in the moon in it and

1682.37 --> 1686.9899999999998
he's smirking at the teacher wearing a

1684.799 --> 1690.07
laboratory coat and in this case to

1686.99 --> 1694.45
overemphasize a hat with wizard wit Nani

1690.07 --> 1698.95
and he is pointing at the school board

1694.45 --> 1701.3300000000002
where a globe is drawn with a moon

1698.95 --> 1703.309
circling around it and it's in the

1701.33 --> 1705.6789999999999
atmosphere for the direct reference that

1703.309 --> 1709.76
that's happening right now and he's

1705.679 --> 1713.779
saying you shall not pass and the flat

1709.76 --> 1720.529
earther is saying I get an F right and

1713.779 --> 1724.61
he loves it because an F yeah it's flat

1720.529 --> 1727.52
and it's funny because he's yeah the

1724.61 --> 1729.9799999999998
teachers being a wizard and he has the

1727.52 --> 1732.529
authority to make him not pass and

1729.98 --> 1734.57
that's very wizard he I don't know maybe

1732.529 --> 1740.62
and my explanation is not killing it I

1734.57 --> 1740.62
don't know it's just one of these things

1744.02 --> 1754.41
what do you think don't think about

1750.63 --> 1759.3300000000002
hello I think about this kind of [ __ ] a

1754.41 --> 1761.0400000000002
lot and it's brilliant and I've already

1759.33 --> 1764.25
considered actually putting this on a

1761.04 --> 1767.31
t-shirt would be a white t-shirt though

1764.25 --> 1770.97
and ordering it but yeah if seriously if

1767.31 --> 1772.8899999999999
I go on a meme spree animatic warfare

1770.97 --> 1776.19
spree that's gonna cost like freaking

1772.89 --> 1778.8300000000002
load of money that I don't have but if I

1776.19 --> 1781.3500000000001
could get like a budget of $1,000 I

1778.83 --> 1784.1599999999999
could make so much of this [ __ ] in very

1781.35 --> 1790.4599999999998
short time just spamming them out there

1784.16 --> 1793.67
but ya gonna have to wait for a while

1790.46 --> 1796.83
what I will probably start by making a

1793.67 --> 1798.8700000000001
leaf a hat and then sending that to mark

1796.83 --> 1803.31
Sargent I like to think I can miss that

1798.87 --> 1807.2099999999998
the money for that and see where we go

1803.31 --> 1808.83
from there get more think of more memes

1807.21 --> 1812.28
oh yeah I've thought of a very basic

1808.83 --> 1817.9499999999998
meme and that is get it balloons with

1812.28 --> 1822.26
the print on it what is it again let me

1817.95 --> 1822.26
you have to phrase it the right way

1835.68 --> 1839.48
it's written so much

1844.38 --> 1850.18
anyway it's in the direction of you

1848.32 --> 1852.49
can't have gas pressure without a

1850.18 --> 1855.04
container that's like the perfect thing

1852.49 --> 1857.05
to print on a balloon

1855.04 --> 1865.42
you know balloon that you're holding on

1857.05 --> 1868.0
a on a rope I think it's so Mimi it's so

1865.42 --> 1871.15
basic it works it's a conversation

1868.0 --> 1876.34
starter to anyone who even take notice

1871.15 --> 1882.6100000000001
of it so yeah memes I've been drowning

1876.34 --> 1886.27
in this crap and it's it's it's a long

1882.61 --> 1889.03
masks fault actually who would have

1886.27 --> 1895.78
thought of that but yeah there was this

1889.03 --> 1898.48
article on Artie about memes huge amount

1895.78 --> 1902.29
of memes and there was apparently like

1898.48 --> 1905.07
meme battle between PewDiePie who's been

1902.29 --> 1909.22
into memes for a while and Elon Musk and

1905.07 --> 1911.8
they were both hilarious and kind of

1909.22 --> 1914.65
stupid at the same time for obvious

1911.8 --> 1921.7
reasons and it's fascinating and just

1914.65 --> 1923.8600000000001
made me yeah go into meme frenzy it's

1921.7 --> 1925.93
magnetic warfare yeah this is another

1923.86 --> 1929.86
meme that I'm probably gonna propel okay

1925.93 --> 1931.8400000000001
you know they say that whatever the

1929.86 --> 1934.03
fourth world war is going to be fought

1931.84 --> 1937.0
the fifth world war is going to be

1934.03 --> 1940.54
fought with sticks or the fourth we

1937.0 --> 1942.25
don't know what the fourth third world

1940.54 --> 1944.59
war is going to be fought with what the

1942.25 --> 1947.2
fifth fourth is gonna be with sticks and

1944.59 --> 1953.4399999999998
stones you know or I dispute that and

1947.2 --> 1956.8600000000001
say that the final world war will be

1953.44 --> 1961.02
mimetic warfare digital pneumatic

1956.86 --> 1961.02
warfare don't we all go insane

1966.809 --> 1972.1
it's gonna be so freakin hilarious we

1969.789 --> 1981.34
just can't focus on anything else

1972.1 --> 1985.3799999999999
anymore but maybe that's just me anyway

1981.34 --> 1985.3799999999999
let's get back to normal

1989.49 --> 1996.63
sorry I'm I'm dominating on

2001.98 --> 2007.83
anyway I'm thinking of just doing like

2004.38 --> 2011.19
it mean merchandising thing and see

2007.83 --> 2014.9089999999999
where that goes yeah I had my meme my

2011.19 --> 2017.309
meme rages before um Nathan oakley's on

2014.909 --> 2020.6390000000001
the debates with all the oils with all

2017.309 --> 2021.6789999999999
the pictures presuppositional sphere

2020.639 --> 2024.779
Hedgehog and

2021.679 --> 2029.01
straw man straw man argument

2024.779 --> 2031.649
regurgitating cow and field of view

2029.01 --> 2034.2
induced optical slanty wrath all that

2031.649 --> 2037.7099999999998
and yeah they would all fit in there

2034.2 --> 2042.659
it's like yeah I love it I I want to

2037.71 --> 2046.98
kind of do that it'll be really cool and

2042.659 --> 2049.7400000000002
and not just boring standard reference

2046.98 --> 2053.73
facts you know because yeah we know that

2049.74 --> 2058.6189999999997
[ __ ] it has to be freaking funny it has

2053.73 --> 2062.48
to be funny in a way that's not not easy

2058.619 --> 2065.4900000000002
to spot and then it's a really good meal

2062.48 --> 2067.44
it has to be multi-layer it has to be

2065.49 --> 2071.339
multi-dimensional it's not properly

2067.44 --> 2073.8
gonna work different levels have to have

2071.339 --> 2076.919
their own responses to it in their own

2073.8 --> 2080.3100000000004
way to be funny in a different way to

2076.919 --> 2082.77
every narrative okay Bobby good does

2080.31 --> 2084.869
having in housekeeping on t-shirts

2082.77 --> 2087.96
because each one of them different

2084.869 --> 2090.119
didn't escape mm-hmm sorry but you know

2087.96 --> 2092.46
you know that housekeeping on Nathan's

2090.119 --> 2094.02
channel yeah yeah glad to have that on a

2092.46 --> 2095.79
t-shirt that because there each of the

2094.02 --> 2099.089
questions but maybe not all of them at

2095.79 --> 2101.55
once but maybe like you know that one

2099.089 --> 2105.2999999999997
question at a time on each t-shirt oh I

2101.55 --> 2108.15
know I could definitely do something

2105.3 --> 2112.77
with that and yeah again it's not a meme

2108.15 --> 2116.55
okay it's just hardcore info but to make

2112.77 --> 2118.77
a meme of it then it you're not the same

2116.55 --> 2123.6600000000003
thing it has to be put in a funny

2118.77 --> 2126.02
context let the hardcore be hidden in

2123.66 --> 2126.02
plain sight

2127.77 --> 2132.86
that's the real power of it and I will

2130.68 --> 2135.6299999999997
do it I will do anything anything

2132.86 --> 2138.05
anything you could think of and I will

2135.63 --> 2141.81
be able to make a freaky meme out of it

2138.05 --> 2149.84
so can't help it

2141.81 --> 2149.84
it's a problem but yeah

2150.56 --> 2157.35
the housekeeping questions are indeed

2153.15 --> 2159.9
very interesting and useful and there's

2157.35 --> 2163.11
more to be done with it and I think that

2159.9 --> 2167.04
yeah if you just have basic balloons you

2163.11 --> 2169.44
know go at a conference have a stand

2167.04 --> 2171.42
with balloons and they're printed on

2169.44 --> 2177.39
them you can't have gas pressure without

2171.42 --> 2179.85
a container just that so basic and it's

2177.39 --> 2181.5899999999997
gonna do something and you know people

2179.85 --> 2183.45
are gonna take these balloons give them

2181.59 --> 2185.7200000000003
to the little kid it's like oh here I go

2183.45 --> 2188.97
have loon not even really looking at it

2185.72 --> 2190.89
maybe or maybe they will and these kids

2188.97 --> 2192.75
are gonna walk around outside with these

2190.89 --> 2198.89
balloons with you can't have gas

2192.75 --> 2198.89
pressure without a container right

2202.03 --> 2213.82
yeah geez SP Mars what the hell is wrong

2206.47 --> 2216.97
with you they don't like this at all do

2213.82 --> 2219.07
they they don't like this at all they

2216.97 --> 2221.23
don't like it when I really have fun and

2219.07 --> 2223.1800000000003
when my fun is actually gonna wake

2221.23 --> 2225.82
people up further so they have to turn

2223.18 --> 2228.19
into total maniacs and somehow they're

2225.82 --> 2230.92
moralized me instinctively because they

2228.19 --> 2233.77
are not people anymore they are giant

2230.92 --> 2235.78
holes their body suits have emptied

2233.77 --> 2239.08
themselves of their spirit and they have

2235.78 --> 2243.9
been replaced by demons that's what

2239.08 --> 2243.9
you've become P Mars and that other guy

2244.5 --> 2250.24
so yeah I could use some moderators in

2247.51 --> 2253.63
here you know what I'm just gonna turn a

2250.24 --> 2257.91
couple of people into moderators that I

2253.63 --> 2261.55
trust will never abuse it because yeah

2257.91 --> 2264.62
Garen B is not here and I need to get

2261.55 --> 2267.53
these freaks under control

2264.62 --> 2270.2599999999998
I mean a good job alright alright it's

2267.53 --> 2273.2000000000003
been really nice to let you go all right

2270.26 --> 2274.2700000000004
[ __ ] we're gonna shoot out again maybe

2273.2 --> 2277.7
another time

2274.27 --> 2280.25
yeah thanks for coming your first

2277.7 --> 2281.99
appearance sorry I was really you so

2280.25 --> 2285.02
much you you brought for some good

2281.99 --> 2287.72
points and we might be double our

2285.02 --> 2289.46
narrative yeah no no I worked out fine

2287.72 --> 2292.04
ah right right right okay

2289.46 --> 2295.6
well yep work is work come back anytime

2292.04 --> 2295.6
oh my cheers fine

2301.24 --> 2308.56
yeah and oh yeah first rule of Arwen's

2305.05 --> 2310.4500000000003
hang out if you're gonna ask can you

2308.56 --> 2314.08
please have a rinse yeah that means

2310.45 --> 2319.0499999999997
you'll never have a wrench okay

2314.08 --> 2319.0499999999997
very basic you get one too

2323.57 --> 2327.55
because yeah if you want one that that's

2325.94 --> 2330.5
a bad sign

2327.55 --> 2333.4700000000003
that's Lucifer inside a you action you

2330.5 --> 2335.81
think oh I see all the opportunities no

2333.47 --> 2341.5
that's not what a wrench is for wrench

2335.81 --> 2341.5
is for its duty its duty its

2342.65 --> 2347.029
it's not really an advantage because

2344.96 --> 2349.039
you're not really allowed to abuse it

2347.029 --> 2350.869
because if you do that I'll take it away

2349.039 --> 2353.0490000000004
and you'll probably never get it back

2350.869 --> 2353.049
again

2367.119 --> 2373.52
yeah you can I want to

2369.42 --> 2376.76
but yeah don't go Otto banning P Mars

2373.52 --> 2376.7599999999998
like ever

2377.5 --> 2388.99
don't don't do that just like get rid of

2386.2 --> 2392.47
them like yeah ban them hide them from

2388.99 --> 2394.7799999999997
channel entirely if they are birdee

2392.47 --> 2397.1499999999996
fault a disgusting name they are

2394.78 --> 2398.4100000000003
disgusting so name then yeah immediately

2397.15 --> 2400.81
outright venom

2398.41 --> 2403.5099999999998
don't hesitate but if it is obvious

2400.81 --> 2405.64
somebody like P Mars just being in a Fey

2403.51 --> 2409.599
mood being completely ridiculous time

2405.64 --> 2411.73
them out because I yeah I don't want to

2409.599 --> 2415.2400000000002
permanently band and they're just gonna

2411.73 --> 2417.31
bother you endlessly if you do that and

2415.24 --> 2419.89
yeah they will have Fame oods and they

2417.31 --> 2424.81
will recover from those famous and

2419.89 --> 2428.17
that's fine so don't be hasty to ban

2424.81 --> 2431.73
anyone except if they have per

2428.17 --> 2431.73
definition a disgusting name

2438.22 --> 2443.56
sorry for all those out there that

2440.68 --> 2445.48
haven't gotten a wrench and might might

2443.56 --> 2449.0099999999998
potentially deserve it it's just that

2445.48 --> 2452.35
yeah people like Shane Walter and Steve

2449.01 --> 2454.1200000000003
over McCool I've shouted you out so many

2452.35 --> 2458.68
times because you're always there and

2454.12 --> 2462.1
that gives me confidence because I don't

2458.68 --> 2464.83
associate you with knowing [ __ ] that's a

2462.1 --> 2467.35
good sign that means that yeah you have

2464.83 --> 2470.14
something sense of responsibility to me

2467.35 --> 2475.96
so yeah that's why I gave it to you for

2470.14 --> 2478.3599999999997
now and yeah the rest of you you know

2475.96 --> 2481.93
don't worry about it it's just an

2478.36 --> 2498.48
emergency precaution ha I spoiled myself

2481.93 --> 2498.48
again and got another or maybe I will

2503.47 --> 2510.5789999999997
make something what is the meaning of

2508.329 --> 2515.01
making maybe I make a what the meaning

2510.579 --> 2515.01
is what's the meaning of this goes on

2518.28 --> 2524.25
damn before you know it I'm gonna

2520.45 --> 2530.14
actually use that logo that's crazy

2524.25 --> 2532.99
that's crazy but it's funny I do

2530.14 --> 2538.3289999999997
hesitate though to use like a marker to

2532.99 --> 2540.97
write on it hmm I think I could use a

2538.329 --> 2542.6800000000003
sticker for that hold on I'm gonna do it

2540.97 --> 2545.0389999999998
right here on air it's so silly I'm

2542.68 --> 2545.0389999999998
gonna do

2555.72 --> 2574.1899999999996
I don't think I even have a regular

2576.22 --> 2582.9599999999996
I'll just use a whiteboard marker

2588.04 --> 2592.75
yeah but you guys started that okay you

2590.38 --> 2598.8
started calling this an Illuminati to

2592.75 --> 2598.8
the song it's all your fault you know

2600.21 --> 2603.48
wasn't me

2631.02 --> 2635.75
I'll give him a blue eye blue iris

2664.18 --> 2669.609
now wait I can do this I could do this

2676.73 --> 2681.72
yeah

2678.64 --> 2681.72
you guys probably

2685.71 --> 2689.36
I don't care because I want to do it

2707.09 --> 2713.9300000000003
yeah by the way I hope it's clear like

2709.67 --> 2716.27
why the eye is looking the way it does

2713.93 --> 2719.93
because it's not an eye that's like

2716.27 --> 2722.81
being dominating or anything it's really

2719.93 --> 2728.3199999999997
like that because it is in glee it's

2722.81 --> 2733.34
enjoying it this is funny

2728.32 --> 2735.5800000000004
supposed to be Illuminati eye that is

2733.34 --> 2735.58
like

2744.54 --> 2750.329
okay

2746.46 --> 2752.75
the sauce are not meant to have stickers

2750.329 --> 2752.75
on them

2765.72 --> 2772.43
but yeah this is sort of it this is the

2769.11 --> 2772.4300000000003
Illuminati plus all

2792.66 --> 2797.31
hmm but I'm gonna eat it now you know

2795.81 --> 2799.88
you shouldn't be playing with your food

2797.31 --> 2799.88
for too long

2840.109 --> 2843.279
these things

2846.84 --> 2851.1600000000003
hey it's a breakfast show you know

2851.34 --> 2853.8500000000004
it's not

2854.77 --> 2859.89
a breakfast without eating is not much

2857.17 --> 2859.89
for breakfast

2863.16 --> 2866.16
Cheers

2878.2 --> 2881.1299999999997
okay

2881.75 --> 2897.44
pastry reviews yes well I didn't like

2891.46 --> 2899.119
yeah but yeah that would mean that I

2897.44 --> 2902.4700000000003
would have to like do different type of

2899.119 --> 2905.4500000000003
pastries oh yeah and I'm a vegetarian so

2902.47 --> 2908.319
that's gonna be missing out on probably

2905.45 --> 2914.8689999999997
three thirds of all pastries out there

2908.319 --> 2919.16
and also I'm not like a guy who likes to

2914.869 --> 2921.73
try new stuff all the freaking time so

2919.16 --> 2924.44
I'm not really good for that I think a

2921.73 --> 2927.049
food reviewer because yeah you have to

2924.44 --> 2929.059
like be new and fresh and something new

2927.049 --> 2932.78
every time and I'm not good at that

2929.059 --> 2937.4300000000003
not really I like to stick to what I

2932.78 --> 2940.73
like and what I know until I need to try

2937.43 --> 2943.2599999999998
something new and then I just do that

2940.73 --> 2946.89
until I find something new that I really

2943.26 --> 2949.32
like and then I stick to that but yeah

2946.89 --> 2953.4
I've have been considering like as soon

2949.32 --> 2956.88
as I get more camera capabilities some

2953.4 --> 2961.59
kind of I don't know special mobile for

2956.88 --> 2964.77
streaming then I could end up just doing

like ever last time I made that was

2992.7 --> 2999.6299999999997
actually with my ex-girlfriend because

2996.78 --> 3002.26
it's not something that I would start

2999.63 --> 3002.26
out making

3002.35 --> 3008.66
but yeah if you're with somebody else

3005.15 --> 3011.71
the pancakes it's lovely it's not my

3008.66 --> 3011.71
specialty but it could

3018.02 --> 3023.58
yeah and I'm getting good questions flat

3021.84 --> 3026.82
earther related questions as well I'm

3023.58 --> 3029.58
should try to answer some of this get a

3026.82 --> 3031.92
little bit more serious so sorry if I'm

3029.58 --> 3038.0699999999997

3131.71 --> 3140.29
it's official approved Effie food Oh God

3138.01 --> 3145.96
you know you can eat whatever you like

3140.29 --> 3148.2599999999998
just never eat reach where there don't

3145.96 --> 3151.26
eat too much meat it's not very healthy

3148.26 --> 3153.76
and oh yeah

3151.26 --> 3158.6800000000003
you know there are some other funny

3153.76 --> 3160.329
things about eating meat and yeah

3158.68 --> 3165.21
before this who I'm gonna get

3160.329 --> 3165.21
controversial okay yeah I ate like

3166.08 --> 3173.34
a type of thing that I learned fiafia

3170.78 --> 3175.4
it's considerably yeah it's sort of

3173.34 --> 3177.78
eating kosher but not like the

3175.4 --> 3182.46
slaughtering type and everything but it

3177.78 --> 3188.19
is like how do you cook don't cook your

3182.46 --> 3191.58
meat any meat with cheese or milk at the

3188.19 --> 3193.46
same time don't put that in one thing

3191.58 --> 3196.89
you're eating that's not good

3193.46 --> 3199.44
it's it sounds weird it's like really

3196.89 --> 3201.24
well yeah I tested it out before I

3199.44 --> 3204.15
became vegetarian tried that for like

3201.24 --> 3207.54
two years and there's a world of

3204.15 --> 3210.0
difference because it conflicts when you

3207.54 --> 3215.7599999999998
do that in your digestion it's very odd

3210.0 --> 3219.02
how that works but if you're gonna if

3215.76 --> 3223.44
you're gonna combine like beef and milk

3219.02 --> 3228.3
it's gonna conflict it's very odd how

3223.44 --> 3230.52
that works and yeah my my intestines

3228.3 --> 3233.25
didn't like that at all i got like

3230.52 --> 3237.18
bloated from it and when i stopped doing

3233.25 --> 3240.3
that permanently everything changed it

3237.18 --> 3243.81
the way my digestion responded to it

3240.3 --> 3244.849
changed like calmed down a lot didn't

3243.81 --> 3251.069
get any more

3244.849 --> 3256.9100000000003
fuming so yeah eat kosher silly isn't it

3251.069 --> 3260.16
I think it's just a very smart trick

3256.91 --> 3263.339
that the Jews have learned over the

3260.16 --> 3265.109
centuries or the millennia it's just

3263.339 --> 3266.5789999999997
basic common knowledge and they try to

3265.109 --> 3268.859
apply it the best they can

3266.579 --> 3272.94
it's like okay if you're going to eat me

3268.859 --> 3275.7
and all that then try it then do it like

3272.94 --> 3277.579
this because it works better we figured

3275.7 --> 3283.02
it out

3277.579 --> 3287.1600000000003
simple so yeah that's our winning

3283.02 --> 3289.619
approved food but yeah just much easier

3287.16 --> 3292.7
to just eat vegetarian then you'll never

3289.619 --> 3292.7000000000003
have these confliction

3296.45 --> 3301.7599999999998
right yeah and if you're gonna have a

3298.64 --> 3303.37
problems with dairy yeah that's that's

3301.76 --> 3307.88
unfortunate

3303.37 --> 3310.2799999999997
like I don't use a lot of dairy I apply

3307.88 --> 3312.29
like a little cheese with things not too

3310.28 --> 3312.71
much if I overdo the cheese it's not

3312.29 --> 3316.88
good

3312.71 --> 3318.44
I don't drink milk like that do use a

3316.88 --> 3323.2400000000002
little milk in my coffee

3318.44 --> 3326.6
so yeah moderation like very strict

3323.24 --> 3329.87
moderation and that works very well for

3326.6 --> 3331.7
me yeah but if you are highly lactose

3329.87 --> 3334.13
intolerant yeah you're gonna have more

3331.7 --> 3337.6
trouble with that although you should

3334.13 --> 3341.21
look into how that actually works and

3337.6 --> 3346.45
often many of these in tolerances are

3341.21 --> 3351.44
based on the quality of the actual dairy

3346.45 --> 3354.46
so yeah organic is always better you

3351.44 --> 3358.43
will have less likelihood of having a

3354.46 --> 3359.3
intolerance response and don't drink

3358.43 --> 3363.9199999999996
soya milk

3359.3 --> 3366.38
I don't recommend it there's other other

3363.92 --> 3369.71
types of things you can do to replace it

3366.38 --> 3375.4900000000002
but it's better to just not replace at

3369.71 --> 3375.4900000000002
all that really needs to replace it

3384.42 --> 3391.14
why Steve you don't know yeah right

3388.89 --> 3394.519
almond milk it's better

3391.14 --> 3400.739
why shouldn't you drink soy milk well

3394.519 --> 3404.16
because they're so in it and yeah soy

3400.739 --> 3411.42
you know if you get the are an organic

3404.16 --> 3412.8289999999997
variety it is not super bad but still if

3411.42 --> 3417.41
you drink a lot of it

3412.829 --> 3417.4100000000003
if you eat a lot of it you're gonna have

3418.64 --> 3426.779
estrogen mimicking type substances that

3424.559 --> 3428.9100000000003
you're gonna be consuming and that are

3426.779 --> 3432.42
gonna change your the way your hormonal

3428.91 --> 3435.239
system functions and it's not like oh

3432.42 --> 3437.46
you take it once you get one dose it

3435.239 --> 3442.079
goes away no it actually starts to

3437.46 --> 3444.93
change to change your metabolism even

3442.079 --> 3447.4500000000003
slightly if you continue to do it it's

3444.93 --> 3449.3089999999997
very freaky it actually transforms you

3447.45 --> 3452.16
from the inside out it turns you into a

3449.309 --> 3456.23
soy boy and it decreases your

3452.16 --> 3459.1499999999996
testosterone production and causes

3456.23 --> 3462.029
mental function changes as well you get

3459.15 --> 3468.14
things like soya rage and it's real

3462.029 --> 3470.7
that's really real it's not a myth

3468.14 --> 3472.529
although yeah again if you do the

3470.7 --> 3474.18
moderation you know it's nothing wrong

3472.529 --> 3477.54
with it but if you're gonna

3474.18 --> 3481.89
ooh I want my soy milk especially at

3477.54 --> 3486.65
Starbucks where they don't use a really

3481.89 --> 3490.5299999999997
good type it's not healthy

3486.65 --> 3492.42
you're gonna shrivel if you're a guy and

3490.53 --> 3495.96
you're gonna drink or eat soy a lot

3492.42 --> 3499.14
you're gonna shrivel and not just

3495.96 --> 3500.91
between your legs like your body it's

3499.14 --> 3503.73
gonna shrivel it's not good for you and

3500.91 --> 3505.22
it's gonna bring high tension and for

3503.73 --> 3508.86
women there's even more danger

3505.22 --> 3514.58
especially if you're young because yeah

3508.86 --> 3517.86
you will get extra as extra estrogen

3514.58 --> 3521.09
like too much of it and that can cause

3517.86 --> 3524.9100000000003
things like breast cancer it can cause

3521.09 --> 3528.09
again like yeah pretty severe hysteria

3524.91 --> 3532.23
and you're seeing that because guess

3528.09 --> 3536.1000000000004
what so she just worries they're also a

3532.23 --> 3540.06
boys and so a women and yeah look look

3536.1 --> 3542.36
what it does it's not good gotta keep

3540.06 --> 3542.36
away

3546.51 --> 3552.6600000000003
so I don't recommend it there's

3550.31 --> 3557.88
alternatives to soy and the industry has

3552.66 --> 3560.67
caught on just because of the whole me

3557.88 --> 3565.56
mobility the sort like the soy meme so a

3560.67 --> 3568.32
boy named industry must and has caught

3565.56 --> 3571.02
on and is trying to find alternatives to

3568.32 --> 3575.76
get away from that because it you can't

3571.02 --> 3578.07
hide that and bet you most of them that

3575.76 --> 3581.07
just went into the food market didn't

3578.07 --> 3583.2000000000003
even really realize that they weren't

3581.07 --> 3585.81
really told about these properties there

3583.2 --> 3588.68
was like from the high ups decided like

3585.81 --> 3593.43
oh we're gonna make this the standard

3588.68 --> 3595.47
because of secret social engineering and

3593.43 --> 3597.5699999999997
they didn't tell anyone of course maybe

3595.47 --> 3602.48
they just told the right class friends

3597.57 --> 3602.48
were all that [ __ ]

3627.79 --> 3633.66
really

3630.66 --> 3633.66
they

3634.18 --> 3638.4289999999996
I don't know

3636.599 --> 3642.7490000000003
why everybody always has to

3638.429 --> 3647.7490000000003
overgeneralize with with Jews it's

3642.749 --> 3647.749
annoying it's also funny by the way

3649.88 --> 3656.6600000000003
there's just it's not all dark it's not

3654.86 --> 3661.9700000000003
all evil absolutely not

3656.66 --> 3664.1299999999997
there's these two sides that are ones

3661.97 --> 3670.5499999999997
and the light ones and the light ones

3664.13 --> 3674.3
are inventive human loving freakin

3670.55 --> 3674.9900000000002
hilarious and usually extremely good at

3674.3 --> 3677.48
what they do

3674.99 --> 3680.99
and the dark side is also extremely good

3677.48 --> 3684.79
at what they do but the exact opposite

3680.99 --> 3684.79
with all the other factors and

3688.04 --> 3696.56
it's a personal cultural thing and you

3691.73 --> 3698.21
can over generalize all that yeah you

3696.56 --> 3699.609
can't just say it's all the same thing

3698.21 --> 3705.23
it's just not true

3699.609 --> 3708.56
and yeah you know Jews they are always

3705.23 --> 3713.0
up to something it doesn't always have

3708.56 --> 3713.99
to be totally evil can just be working

3713.0 --> 3718.19
on the plan

3713.99 --> 3721.609
it said the self-sustained the Prophet

3718.19 --> 3724.1
to see things coming to know things

3721.609 --> 3729.71
ahead of time doesn't make them all evil

3724.1 --> 3734.15
I just can't stand it can't stand it

3729.71 --> 3740.48
that this always has to be so freakin

3734.15 --> 3743.7400000000002
dark sad it's not there not right

3740.48 --> 3746.63
exactly you would not the Jews Zionists

3743.74 --> 3752.4199999999996
well among the Zionists are the more

3746.63 --> 3757.01
fanatical Imperial minded ones that go

3752.42 --> 3759.08
into extreme measures basically to to

3757.01 --> 3763.2200000000003
get things their way and they don't give

3759.08 --> 3766.58
a [ __ ] and that's a big problem but yeah

3763.22 --> 3768.47
good Jews the rest no there's plenty of

3766.58 --> 3771.35
Jews that that thing that's ridiculous

3768.47 --> 3773.6899999999996
that this is all stupid they they've

3771.35 --> 3775.88
read all the books they know this [ __ ]

3773.69 --> 3778.16
and they know like this is ridiculous

3775.88 --> 3782.57
what they're doing with Israel is

3778.16 --> 3783.8999999999996
ridiculous it's all not as God meant it

3782.57 --> 3787.7690000000002
to be

3783.9 --> 3791.549
and yeah they're being attacked by the

3787.769 --> 3794.8799999999997
Zionists as well so we got to protect

3791.549 --> 3798.72
them and target the right ones basically

3794.88 --> 3803.059
with our with our complaints and are

3798.72 --> 3803.0589999999997
trying to point out what's wrong

3820.61 --> 3829.76
but it is my rule of thumb a very smart

3825.29 --> 3832.48
thing to realize that yeah the Jews are

3829.76 --> 3836.9900000000002
indeed always up to something

3832.48 --> 3839.44
cuz they're just freaking smart and they

3836.99 --> 3839.4399999999996
plan ahead

3852.109 --> 3858.0989999999997
in that sense I wish I was a little bit

3854.63 --> 3862.9100000000003
more Jewish I don't even know if I am

3858.099 --> 3866.15
probably not no I'm not by the the oil

3862.91 --> 3869.269
to your standards well yeah I do come

3866.15 --> 3873.38
from a family where from kind of a

3869.269 --> 3876.709
liberal angle my grandmother the mother

3873.38 --> 3879.589
of my mother and my mother did think

3876.709 --> 3882.3799999999997
like yeah we're jews empathizers they

3879.589 --> 3888.319
like the culture they knew some of these

3882.38 --> 3897.0190000000002
people and yeah we with the family we

3888.319 --> 3899.299
read into religious things and Jewish

3897.019 --> 3901.8489999999997
philosophy and such and it was really

3899.299 --> 3904.7889999999998
good I liked it a lot I have a lot of

3901.849 --> 3912.1890000000003
respect for this stuff when for the

3904.789 --> 3912.1890000000003
smarts and the just the detail of it but

3912.19 --> 3916.82
dad that of course yeah you know dad

3915.32 --> 3919.94
doesn't really make you would you

3916.82 --> 3921.9500000000003
officially in it's it's just hard to

3919.94 --> 3924.98
tell these days I do always seem to be

3921.95 --> 3928.7599999999998
wearing black does that make me a Jew

3924.98 --> 3932.63
you can't this is not really working

3928.76 --> 3935.15
I could probably dress up as June put a

3932.63 --> 3938.81
big hat on put some of my hair like this

3935.15 --> 3945.8

3938.81 --> 3949.04
could have like a a Jew thing going if I

3945.8 --> 3950.63
wanted look I could act like you could

3949.04 --> 3952.43
probably even have the accent of one

3950.63 --> 3955.3900000000003
it's not that hard do you have to

3952.43 --> 3955.39
practice a little bit

3956.8 --> 3962.5600000000004
I already have two mustache but I don't

3960.1 --> 3966.0099999999998

still part elven and just never gonna

3966.01 --> 3968.28
work

3981.55 --> 3990.61
I just like to say thank God before the

3984.55 --> 3992.71
Jews thank god they're there because the

3990.61 --> 3994.92
world would be a lot less funny if they

3992.71 --> 3994.92
weren't

4012.2 --> 4021.22
Oh Chris Matt that's not true there's

4017.66 --> 4021.22

4027.52 --> 4036.1
Brandon cook thanks for that don't think

4032.96 --> 4036.1
my nose is too long

4049.38 --> 4053.1800000000003
I don't never Joe knows now

4056.77 --> 4064.78

4064.78 --> 4072.46
mix of races anyway you know it's a mess

4072.89 --> 4080.33
the the what do the dewclaw what is that

4100.65 --> 4103.19

4111.06 --> 4115.8
it's freaking a rusty as well I'm just

4113.85 --> 4120.39
happy to have some kind of

4115.8 --> 4121.2300000000005
transportation I haven't driven a car in

4120.39 --> 4126.9400000000005
a long time

4121.23 --> 4130.74
I used to have one

4126.94 --> 4130.74
and then I couldn't afford it anymore

4136.6 --> 4148.5
Oh am i struggling for Fe conversation

4140.95 --> 4152.38
not really now I'm doing fine

4148.5 --> 4157.86
and besides earlier we had a heavy

4152.38 --> 4157.86
conversation with my guest

4160.14 --> 4165.859
with Casey Jones we did talk about it

4165.92 --> 4172.13
could talk some more about it sure but

4169.6 --> 4175.339
it's probably only gonna really work if

4172.13 --> 4177.29
you get in on the panel and then really

4175.339 --> 4179.119
talk about it because yeah I may make

4177.29 --> 4181.04
quick comment about it and then I'll be

4179.119 --> 4183.369
distracted by some meme or something or

4181.04 --> 4185.2699999999995
people being silly

4183.369 --> 4195.619
chocolates saying calling me

4185.27 --> 4197.51
bizarro Legolas again still is not

4195.619 --> 4203.659
really correct though like I am NOT a

4197.51 --> 4205.6990000000005
wood elf not now or a high elf there's

4203.659 --> 4207.949
different type of elves you do realize

4205.699 --> 4213.199
that right there different types of

4207.949 --> 4215.719
elves get the grey elves the half-elves

4213.199 --> 4218.509999999999
you have the wood elves and you have the

4215.719 --> 4220.01
high elves lot Lorien has high elves

4218.51 --> 4221.75
that's why they are very long very

4220.01 --> 4225.59
persistently blonde and you have the

4221.75 --> 4228.38
wood elves which are also blog but not

4225.59 --> 4231.58
all of them necessarily they're a lot

4228.38 --> 4235.79
smaller and there are a lot feisty err

4231.58 --> 4240.38
and then you have the grey elves which

4235.79 --> 4244.05
are barely even mentioned they're more

4240.38 --> 4247.89
like diplomats and trader type

4244.05 --> 4256.02
and the half elves are well half human

4247.89 --> 4264.6990000000005
so I fit in the you had to go there

4256.02 --> 4268.1990000000005
didn't you Chris Matt thanks right

4264.699 --> 4271.928999999999
but I fall into the category of half-elf

4268.199 --> 4274.139999999999
with my name it's just it's a half-elven

4271.929 --> 4274.14
name

4302.01 --> 4307.59
yeah for those who don't know in the

4305.38 --> 4307.59
Dutch language

4309.9 --> 4318.089999999999
an elf the word elf means also eleven

4319.65 --> 4326.67
so yeah I'm five and a half in that

4324.19 --> 4326.669999999999
sense

4335.12 --> 4338.12
hmm

4340.85 --> 4346.490000000001
good morning Karen B there's a dedicated

4348.05 --> 4359.58
mass producing sock then that hates you

4352.71 --> 4364.82
in chat you really pissed off a lot of

4359.58 --> 4364.82
Globus yesterday with your amazing video

4384.31 --> 4387.499000000001
[Music]

4391.03 --> 4394.03
indeed

4401.199 --> 4409.03
okay yeah I'm not sure I think I may be

4406.54 --> 4409.9
rounding out the show because I went

4409.03 --> 4413.739
over an hour

4409.9 --> 4421.12
I had Nathan started to premiere yeah

4413.739 --> 4427.57
he's not doing a life show but it will

4421.12 --> 4429.55
still be premiering stuff and yeah I

4427.57 --> 4437.79
talked about a lot of things here

4429.55 --> 4437.79
memes mostly and then my plans for memes

4445.58 --> 4453.13
and yeah hope you enjoyed the show

4455.37 --> 4458.18
mm-hmm

4459.179 --> 4464.15
yeah I'll show the picture again just

4461.489 --> 4464.15
for the fun of it

4475.44 --> 4478.49
I hope you enjoyed

4483.2 --> 4487.63
Karen tell me what do you think did you

4485.24 --> 4487.63
get this

4506.06 --> 4511.660000000001
I'm only gonna and present after you

4508.46 --> 4511.66
responded to this Karen

4534.229 --> 4542.030000000001
cool yeah

4539.749 --> 4548.69
I drew it up on the under run this

4542.03 --> 4550.009999999999
morning but it's I love it I want

4548.69 --> 4553.098999999999
something like that yeah

4550.01 --> 4556.280000000001
maybe just that being that silly-looking

4553.099 --> 4559.849
sketchy is good enough because it is

4556.28 --> 4563.478999999999
just what it is or they have like a real

4559.849 --> 4565.909000000001
cartoonist make a proper more painted

4563.479 --> 4568.159000000001
like picture out of it that will be so

4565.909 --> 4572.42
cool and just have that on a t-shirt or

4568.159 --> 4576.339999999999
something or maybe you know to have a

4572.42 --> 4581.139
column some kind with memes and

4576.34 --> 4586.099
paraphernalia and t-shirts and hats

4581.139 --> 4588.32
MIFA hats and maybe sell balloons with

4586.099 --> 4590.929
the print on them you can't have gas

4588.32 --> 4592.219
pressure without a container that kind

4590.929 --> 4597.86
of thing I'd love to do that

4592.219 --> 4600.17
love to have stuff like that and I

4597.86 --> 4603.19
probably can't prevent myself from going

4600.17 --> 4603.1900000000005
there eventually

4611.269 --> 4616.9890000000005
what are you saying random cuckoo a half

4619.669 --> 4628.729
okey but I'm not really look I'm good at

4626.09 --> 4631.369000000001
like designing stuff and thinking of

4628.729 --> 4633.889
context and all that but the actual

4631.369 --> 4637.539
drawing itself I'm not really that good

4633.889 --> 4639.86
at it I have drawn like a lot in my life

4637.539 --> 4642.919
but it's always been more about

4639.86 --> 4648.978999999999
designing and sketching and just not

4642.919 --> 4650.599
really making a real nice looking

4648.979 --> 4652.789000000001
picture either that's never really been

4650.599 --> 4655.369000000001
my thing I think that just wasn't able

4652.789 --> 4657.949
to move to that point it just didn't

4655.369 --> 4659.989
work out it's really annoying and

4657.949 --> 4662.808999999999
disappointed in retrospect I wish I was

4659.989 --> 4664.638999999999
that good I really do because then I

4662.809 --> 4667.909000000001
could just do this [ __ ] and just like oh

4664.639 --> 4676.519
look awesome painting [ __ ] I just made

4667.909 --> 4680.659
it that kind of thing but get a lot of

4676.519 --> 4684.610000000001
ideas but it's just not so easy to to

4680.659 --> 4684.61
translate it into an actual product

4700.8 --> 4706.820000000001
all right and yeah Brandon cook what you

4703.32 --> 4709.7699999999995
said the half-globe know in that picture

4706.82 --> 4715.37
see it again it's again it's a very

4709.77 --> 4719.93
rough sketch okay but the picture is of

4715.37 --> 4724.62
that guy with the grin on his face

4719.93 --> 4729.66
holding a snow globe type typical flat

4724.62 --> 4731.46
earth bottle with a dome over it and the

4729.66 --> 4732.54
two lights of the Sun and Moon spinning

4731.46 --> 4736.38
over it just like that

4732.54 --> 4738.54
that flat earth guy makes you know makes

4736.38 --> 4743.55
those models so he's bringing that to

4738.54 --> 4745.74
class and smirking as the teacher gets

4743.55 --> 4749.39
really triggered and starts acting like

4745.74 --> 4752.79
a wizard and he's expecting to get an F

4749.39 --> 4757.02
but he loves it because yeah an F is

4752.79 --> 4759.41
flat so he's just going home for with

4757.02 --> 4759.410000000001
the joke

4764.67 --> 4772.95
okay okay yeah anyway I am gonna round

4771.16 --> 4774.48
out the show now and it's been

4772.95 --> 4777.57
interesting

4774.48 --> 4777.57
[Music]

4788.629 --> 4795.979
yeah if you like this video then please

4793.879 --> 4797.329
avoid it if you don't like it or your

4795.979 --> 4799.01
troll and there's plenty out there I

4797.329 --> 4800.808999999999
think then download it doesn't really

4799.01 --> 4803.629
matter about is about it will be

4800.809 --> 4806.899
registered and yeah don't forget to

4803.629 --> 4808.82
share the show every single time I say

4806.899 --> 4814.039000000001
it but it's kind of important especially

4808.82 --> 4816.53
if I'm gonna go on the meme bandwagon

4814.039 --> 4818.499
yeah sharing is very important because a

4816.53 --> 4823.629
meme can't spread if you don't share it

4818.499 --> 4827.769
so do it also spread the meme hashtag

4823.629 --> 4830.03
MIFA that's where it all starts

4827.769 --> 4837.530000000001
you know what to do you know how it

4830.03 --> 4839.09
works if somebody asks you yeah another

4837.53 --> 4841.429
meme entered my mind as I said it

4839.09 --> 4847.939
somebody asked you if you're a god you

4841.429 --> 4851.059
say yes if you know that joke then

4847.939 --> 4854.09
you're probably around my age and don't

4851.059 --> 4856.519
actually do that but yeah it's a joke

4854.09 --> 4859.219
but if somebody asks you what does me

4856.519 --> 4861.649
fast and for yeah you can always say you

4859.219 --> 4867.459
size them up and say yeah it means make

4861.649 --> 4871.789000000001
earth free again no it's always good and

4867.459 --> 4874.6089999999995
yeah if you think they may be a little

4871.789 --> 4876.32
bit deeper into information then you

4874.609 --> 4878.629000000001
could tell them the bottom line and that

4876.32 --> 4880.549999999999
is make earth flat again and that's the

4878.629 --> 4883.459
whole point of the meme it's a

4880.55 --> 4885.820000000001
multi-purpose multi-layer mean it's of

4883.459 --> 4889.929
this age like none other

4885.82 --> 4889.929
hashtag meifa

4892.43 --> 4898.71
[Music]

4894.1 --> 4898.71
superjet where where's the superjet

4900.91 --> 4912.57
oh wait the you mean the one yeah sure

4907.24 --> 4912.57
right so hashtag neva spread it

4915.659 --> 4922.53
and I'm gonna make superjet retracted

4918.6 --> 4922.889
you wish you wish you could do that all

4922.53 --> 4927.659
right

4922.889 --> 4932.2390000000005
yeah why not make earth female again see

4927.659 --> 4936.629999999999
that's the power that's the power of it

4932.239 --> 4941.03
the F the word F or the word the letter

4936.63 --> 4941.03
F it's it's amazing

4950.94 --> 4958.169999999999
yeah well you can go to bad places as

4954.93 --> 4963.51
well you can take it any way you want

4958.17 --> 4968.49
you know but yeah the original meaning

4963.51 --> 4971.04
MIFA I told you in a safe approach and

4968.49 --> 4974.19
you can have the bottom line approach

4971.04 --> 4977.21
that's just yeah that's what it's for

4974.19 --> 4977.21
that's what I made it for

4988.52 --> 4998.360000000001
so yeah right yeah subscribe to my

4996.15 --> 5002.2699999999995

4998.36 --> 5004.429
if you are still subscribe every now and

5002.27 --> 5005.9890000000005

5004.429 --> 5009.05
you know when I'm going life sometimes

5005.989 --> 5014.629999999999
they go in life earlier than the

5009.05 --> 5021.1900000000005
standard time which is 2 o'clock 2 p.m.

5014.63 --> 5027.909000000001

standard time I run my show sometimes

5044.27 --> 5049.790000000001

5046.82 --> 5051.5
you have to bail on then you'll see when

5049.79 --> 5053.12
I go on if I go on a little early

5051.5 --> 5056.449
