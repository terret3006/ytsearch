1.949 --> 9.429
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.129 --> 13.989999999999998
early-bird number 44 I'm your host

9.429 --> 18.34
Arwen and today is a pretty mild day

13.99 --> 20.019
it's still cloudy but it's been even a

18.34 --> 28.060000000000002
little warmer than yesterday so it's

20.019 --> 33.43
pretty nice weather huh so how you guys

28.06 --> 38.29
doing Casey Jones uh sir I'm out

33.43 --> 48.06
mark smiley R and M Rick's j-mac are in

38.29 --> 52.72
check here for now ho Dan Winfield yeah

48.06 --> 53.71
so yesterday's gaming session was a

52.72 --> 60.0
blast

53.71 --> 60.0
oh my god was pretty pretty awesome

63.269 --> 71.89
although man yeah I as usual one of

68.86 --> 75.01
these guys always brings organic beer

71.89 --> 76.66
just for me the the hilarious thing is I

75.01 --> 79.42
tend to be the only one actually

76.66 --> 81.07
drinking although one of the guys the

79.42 --> 85.42
other guys sometimes take some beer as

81.07 --> 88.47999999999999
well but yeah again it hit pretty damn

85.42 --> 93.04
hard so he actually brought six beers

88.48 --> 95.35000000000001
and I guess before I I tend to take them

93.04 --> 96.159
all this time like at four I was like

95.35 --> 101.14
okay

96.159 --> 105.25
this feels very familiar very familiar

101.14 --> 109.57
indeed just like two days ago so I cut

105.25 --> 113.47
it myself off at that point and yeah

109.57 --> 115.36
still I mean I was functional and we had

113.47 --> 121.36
a really good time it was hilarious a

115.36 --> 124.69
lot of funny inside joke kind of [ __ ] it

121.36 --> 127.15
was really fun a lot of acting no action

124.69 --> 132.49
actually so it was purely acting politic

127.15 --> 134.59
and my players as usual went in overkill

132.49 --> 138.94
suspicion mode like some

134.59 --> 141.22
they didn't know was doing something in

138.94 --> 143.05
secret and when they refused to reveal

141.22 --> 146.17
what they were doing they immediately

143.05 --> 148.84
imprisoned them and cursed the [ __ ] out

146.17 --> 152.55999999999997
of them and like interrogated her by the

148.84 --> 154.83
way was actually kind of a nobility

152.56 --> 160.69
person those nosing around

154.83 --> 165.28
so yeah they may have accidentally by

160.69 --> 167.68
their own D&D suspicion over killed The

165.28 --> 169.989
Situation's really going to result in

167.68 --> 175.0
some lash back

169.989 --> 178.45000000000002
although yeah they did manage to kind of

175.0 --> 180.549
apologize after the interrogation and

178.45 --> 183.86999999999998
[ __ ] although they haven't even revealed

180.549 --> 188.41
that they cursed this person with like

183.87 --> 190.03
it's it's a Geass it's like a

188.41 --> 192.04
conditional thing and there were

190.03 --> 195.489
basically like oh this person can never

192.04 --> 200.13
lie to us and this person can ever cause

195.489 --> 200.13
us harm or they all have like a sincere

200.43 --> 206.89000000000001
detrimental effect on it on the mental

203.109 --> 208.45000000000002
capacities like pretty bad and and they

206.89 --> 211.23899999999998
did it on the person who was actually

208.45 --> 216.63
kind of a good character but yeah that's

211.239 --> 216.63
fine for the king their king

217.65 --> 224.829
it's so funny the [ __ ] can happen and I

221.549 --> 230.25
even though I should I never expect the

224.829 --> 230.25
players to act this overkill at things

231.09 --> 237.06900000000002
it's just hilarious how that works out

233.62 --> 239.65
anyway the story went pretty amusing and

237.069 --> 243.88
I will be writing it down it's probably

239.65 --> 247.06
gonna end up in public on the hangout

243.88 --> 248.859
thing in like two or three months from

247.06 --> 253.2
now since I still have a lot of catching

248.859 --> 258.0
up to do it was hilarious but yeah today

253.2 --> 263.83
I'm like slightly nauseated all day

258.0 --> 266.55
really annoying I don't feel as dimmed

263.83 --> 270.31
as it were I did

266.55 --> 271.93
two days ago thank God but I do feel

270.31 --> 281.92
slightly nauseated that's really

271.93 --> 283.93
freaking annoying but I'll be all right

281.92 --> 288.45
I know it's probably gonna pass in a few

283.93 --> 288.45
hours anyway Cheers

289.98 --> 300.0
christmas is coming

291.55 --> 300.0
ah now I feel peer pressure to the

300.39 --> 307.87
Christmas stunt ish because like no

305.05 --> 310.06
matter the angle of approach doing

307.87 --> 313.33
absolutely nothing nothing with

310.06 --> 317.65
Christmas is almost like a generalized

313.33 --> 321.34
cultural no no it's like okay and then

317.65 --> 323.34999999999997
you're really like a green tree that

321.34 --> 326.22999999999996
kind of figure if you like do nothing

323.35 --> 328.66
different so I almost feel obligated I

326.23 --> 335.98
have to do something silly or something

328.66 --> 339.1
color II or extra lights or I don't know

335.98 --> 341.26
I'll try to do something slightly out of

339.1 --> 347.38
the usual for my own doing I guess for

341.26 --> 349.45
Christmas yeah oh yeah also one of the

347.38 --> 353.11
cats in this neighborhood has apparently

349.45 --> 357.15
adopted me that's really funny it's a

353.11 --> 360.54
really nice pretty cool cat totally grey

357.15 --> 364.75
and I've seen it walking around like

360.54 --> 366.49
right across up here and even getting

364.75 --> 371.41
into fights with other cat it's it's a

366.49 --> 374.41
male cat and he's real like in the young

371.41 --> 377.8
yeah right beyond the the young adults

374.41 --> 380.05
face so he is like pretty grown now and

377.8 --> 383.11
you can really see he's developing these

380.05 --> 387.73
muscles and everything and he is really

383.11 --> 390.07
nice and yeah makes me want to have a

387.73 --> 391.99
cat I don't really have a cat I can't

390.07 --> 395.169
really afford that also I don't have a

391.99 --> 397.39
proper space for it but this cat has

395.169 --> 399.82
adopted me because every single time I

397.39 --> 401.86
go outside

399.82 --> 405.76
it always just happens to run at me

401.86 --> 408.88
right that moment and it tends to walk

405.76 --> 414.25
with me up the entire staircase every

408.88 --> 417.45
single time it's really funny it's like

414.25 --> 421.66
some people have walks with their dog or

417.45 --> 429.31
with other people and I apparently now

421.66 --> 438.46000000000004
have walks with this cat and I do

429.31 --> 441.36
appreciate it yeah I do like cats and I

438.46 --> 444.46
like it especially when they like me

441.36 --> 446.5
although there is another new cat like

444.46 --> 448.39
always hanging around in this floor and

446.5 --> 451.93
these two cats always have like this

448.39 --> 454.3
called typical competitiveness look out

451.93 --> 456.40000000000003
every time this this cat wants to get

454.3 --> 457.93
like inside my house that the other cats

456.4 --> 462.57
not close by otherwise they're gonna

457.93 --> 467.28000000000003
start a fight so that's another thingy

462.57 --> 467.28
it's it's kind of funny

470.7 --> 481.67
okay see people are pouring in Fe news

476.25 --> 489.72
here for now gassy juice Jeffrey Bale

481.67 --> 493.29
Marnell welcome let's see yeah yeah

489.72 --> 495.81
that's right we do not have receptors

493.29 --> 502.89000000000004
for Elko in the body it is basically a

495.81 --> 508.65
poison a sugar based poison that has

502.89 --> 511.95
mental effects on us and it does have a

508.65 --> 518.1
function but yeah it will always have

511.95 --> 524.46
that bodily detriment unless you like

518.1 --> 527.01
are prepared supplemental wise food wise

524.46 --> 530.1600000000001
to take that hit that you will get

527.01 --> 531.9
because of it and it takes quite a some

530.16 --> 534.87
preparation you have to be sure to take

531.9 --> 537.54
enough water to be sure that when you

534.87 --> 542.19
start drinking you are fed you have

537.54 --> 545.13
plenty of yeah yeah in the say in the

542.19 --> 546.9000000000001
Netherlands you have a bottom like a

545.13 --> 549.06
bottom in your stomach basically don't

546.9 --> 557.0699999999999
drink it when you haven't eaten or when

549.06 --> 560.67
you're hungry common sense and make sure

557.07 --> 564.0
you don't when you drink alcohol don't

560.67 --> 568.53
get all this poison [ __ ] like don't get

564.0 --> 570.57
cheap chips with flavor enhancers and

568.53 --> 572.31
all that crap while you have alkyl

570.57 --> 576.99
because that's just gonna aggravate each

572.31 --> 580.92
other it's gonna make it worse and yeah

576.99 --> 583.86
I I do that I am very careful with it

580.92 --> 586.0799999999999
but despite that like even these past

583.86 --> 589.02
few days I'm just not really able to

586.08 --> 591.2700000000001
handle alcohol properly so I guess I'm

589.02 --> 593.61
just gonna stay away from it as much as

591.27 --> 595.59
possible for now until maybe spring

593.61 --> 601.13
starts up again until I feel it's

595.59 --> 601.13
changed and just stick this to smoking

602.7 --> 615.3000000000001
okay Oh God then that's TMI for a

610.69 --> 615.3000000000001
breakfast show okay

631.58 --> 634.51
thank you

636.329 --> 639.049
hmm

643.07 --> 651.529
yes oh here for now ask a question they

646.339 --> 655.1
would go yes I am organic food drink

651.529 --> 658.759
consumer only and I take it beyond that

655.1 --> 662.12
because I also avoid msg although

658.759 --> 664.61
sometimes I will allow it if you lose

662.12 --> 668.99
the presumed organic version however

664.61 --> 672.279
they supposed to have done that and but

668.99 --> 678.6800000000001
I just like things like chips and

672.279 --> 682.49
bullion like super concentrate kind of

678.68 --> 685.819
thing if those things I absolutely avoid

682.49 --> 690.8
with msg with yeast extract as they call

685.819 --> 694.459
it the organic world's very cleverly

690.8 --> 696.819
hidden yeah I avoid it from those types

694.459 --> 699.8
of products at all cost

696.819 --> 702.8
and its really nice because there are

699.8 --> 704.42
chips without it now but more because

702.8 --> 707.3599999999999
I'm not the only one complaining about

704.42 --> 710.05
people that are that know about food

707.36 --> 712.88
know this and it's been like very

710.05 --> 714.74
agitating to a lot of people that eat

712.88 --> 718.1
organic like why is this still allowed

714.74 --> 720.199
this is chemical waste and we don't even

718.1 --> 722.9300000000001
care really if it is supposed to be

720.199 --> 726.26
organic it's still that compound that's

722.93 --> 728.569
just not healthy for you even though the

726.26 --> 730.49
detriments of the organic version might

728.569 --> 734.74
be slightly less or something it's still

730.49 --> 734.74
not good for you so

738.11 --> 745.76
yeah I am organic only but I do a little

743.0 --> 754.16
step at all on top of that I'm also a

745.76 --> 759.769
vegetarian and I am a prepare food

754.16 --> 762.529
avoider in the sense that I try to make

759.769 --> 764.8100000000001
all the food that I eat as much from

762.529 --> 771.73
scratch as possible with some exceptions

764.81 --> 776.4499999999999
like bread I do buy decent good quality

771.73 --> 779.63
bread spelt based without yeast there's

776.45 --> 783.0790000000001
alternatives call it a sim it's like a

779.63 --> 784.7
sour bass thing and I like it some

783.079 --> 789.05
people don't like that type of that I do

784.7 --> 790.6400000000001
and it is healthier will be and the

789.05 --> 793.959
bread is more dense and everything and I

790.64 --> 803.39
like that like something that you want

793.959 --> 807.399
also yeah besides bread like on rare

803.39 --> 810.26
occasions I do like buy a prefab

807.399 --> 813.68
vegetarian or vegan lasagna no

810.26 --> 816.3199999999999
vegetarian lasagna cheese like a

813.68 --> 820.01
vegetarian lasagna and because you have

816.32 --> 821.3900000000001
that type it feels pretty ok it's not as

820.01 --> 824.27
good as if it I would make my own

821.39 --> 827.39
lasagna but it's still pretty decent and

824.27 --> 829.1899999999999
it's really a handy meal that I can just

827.39 --> 831.3199999999999
take somewhere put in there often and

829.19 --> 834.95
eat it and that way I don't have to

831.32 --> 837.7700000000001
worry about making elaborate dinner on a

834.95 --> 841.13
moment's notice or eating at unusual

837.77 --> 841.899
times in advance or afterward so that's

841.13 --> 846.8
handy

841.899 --> 850.37
but yeah besides that I basically make

846.8 --> 854.3
everything myself I don't buy things

850.37 --> 859.399
like cookies I very very very rarely buy

854.3 --> 863.0
things like chocolate even although I do

859.399 --> 865.94
you like it but it's just and pure

863.0 --> 867.92
chocolate is better but still you know I

865.94 --> 869.5400000000001
don't like it that much so only when I

867.92 --> 872.12
have very specific

869.54 --> 874.0999999999999
needs like an impulse like okay for some

872.12 --> 877.279
reason I eat dark chocolate right now

874.1 --> 882.889
and I'll get so and that helps but

877.279 --> 885.199
that's rare other than that yeah I make

882.889 --> 893.36
everything myself and I'm even kind of

885.199 --> 900.769
repetitive in my diet I just launched my

893.36 --> 906.41
ring from my finger and it works out

900.769 --> 909.38
I eat hamburgers with like vegetarian

906.41 --> 920.149
hamburgers basically and with like

909.38 --> 922.88
lettuce and tomato yeah and that works

920.149 --> 924.829
oh yeah and spinach burgers it's

922.88 --> 927.259
vegetarian spinach burgers I really like

924.829 --> 930.92
them in my hamburgers and yeah this

927.259 --> 936.019
works out I eat that a lot sometimes I

930.92 --> 938.269
get some potatoes it's like mayonnaise

936.019 --> 942.47
based sauce or whatever and some

938.269 --> 944.6
broccoli and that's mostly my diet

942.47 --> 949.339
sometimes I get like spaghetti and they

944.6 --> 953.4490000000001
carefully make it from scratch with

949.339 --> 956.69
actual tomatoes that I prepare and yeah

953.449 --> 958.399
all the goodies of that and that way I

956.69 --> 961.94
don't know it works it works I keep

958.399 --> 964.85
healthy it feels right gives me a lot of

961.94 --> 968.389
energy and also it doesn't give me so

964.85 --> 971.149
many cravings throughout the day it's

968.389 --> 973.61
really funny because 10 years ago when I

971.149 --> 976.01
just started eating organic I still had

973.61 --> 979.5500000000001
like sometimes these weird cravings that

976.01 --> 982.699
just wouldn't go away and I don't have

979.55 --> 986.829
that anymore now one could correlate

982.699 --> 989.5089999999999
that directly to the falling away of MSG

986.829 --> 993.9799999999999
because that is typically what MSG does

989.509 --> 999.92
it is a neurotoxin that and it

993.98 --> 1001.519
artificially makes you not really hungry

999.92 --> 1006.81
but lust

1001.519 --> 1010.41
crave for for tasty for sweet or salty

1006.81 --> 1012.75
things like it enhances that sensation

1010.41 --> 1016.829
and some people have the constantly

1012.75 --> 1019.079
because of this and I even have periods

1016.829 --> 1021.42
where I had that and I would eat myself

1019.079 --> 1024.089
sick with things like chips and such

1021.42 --> 1026.1
terrible terrible have it very unhealthy

1024.089 --> 1028.77
but I don't do that anymore and since

1026.1 --> 1033.26
I've stopped knowing that these things

1028.77 --> 1036.12
have gone away so very happy about that

1033.26 --> 1040.3799999999999
now and yeah again sometimes the only

1036.12 --> 1046.9489999999998
unusual type of craving is tends to be

1040.38 --> 1053.45
chocolate based so so yeah that's me

1046.949 --> 1053.45
rambling about food dead

1059.27 --> 1065.09
right yeah Jeff Rubio fast food

1062.84 --> 1071.1789999999999
hamburgers are disgusting

1065.09 --> 1074.57
I agree although you know some like more

1071.179 --> 1076.25
local type of places do make pretty

1074.57 --> 1078.559
decent hamburgers they're not gonna be

1076.25 --> 1081.17
organic but they're still pretty decent

1078.559 --> 1084.83
much better than like the super big fast

1081.17 --> 1087.77
food chains tend to be and what I make I

1084.83 --> 1091.22
really make it by hand I get the

1087.77 --> 1095.92
ingredients pretty fresh fresh lettuce

1091.22 --> 1102.16
fresh tomato cut them up on the spots I

1095.92 --> 1106.19
have baked onions and the spinach burger

1102.16 --> 1106.8500000000001
in I use olive oil mostly with the salt

1106.19 --> 1110.929
and pepper

1106.85 --> 1115.73
and yeah it's good it's really fresh and

1110.929 --> 1120.46
it feels healthy and yeah I use organic

1115.73 --> 1124.79
based ketchup

1120.46 --> 1127.3400000000001
it's mayonnaise and chili sauce yeah I

1124.79 --> 1132.35
like the sauces I try not to overdo it

1127.34 --> 1138.1899999999998
but yeah I felt any detriment from doing

1132.35 --> 1141.4099999999999
that like or even the organic sauces are

1138.19 --> 1144.6200000000001
much or yeah much better I don't know

1141.41 --> 1147.41
they are they are just considerable as

1144.62 --> 1149.4499999999998
food they do feed you in a in a

1147.41 --> 1153.41
nourishing way in contrast to a lot of

1149.45 --> 1156.8600000000001
non-organic sauces contains crap all of

1153.41 --> 1162.76
it tends to do that just be really salty

1156.86 --> 1165.83
all its flavor experience the flavor and

1162.76 --> 1169.52
yeah Organic sauces don't have that as

1165.83 --> 1172.22
much but yeah if you if you're not an

1169.52 --> 1174.74
MSG addict then your senses will tone

1172.22 --> 1178.3700000000001
down and you won't have a problem with

1174.74 --> 1181.309
tastes not being extreme so then it's

1178.37 --> 1184.28
very enjoyable very nice I like it I

1181.309 --> 1186.92
don't like the be too strong tasting

1184.28 --> 1191.059
stuff it nauseates me

1186.92 --> 1197.749
this to salt chips too

1191.059 --> 1199.249
sweet sweets too aromatic candy think

1197.749 --> 1202.34
they're disgusting

1199.249 --> 1215.169
no keep it normal

1202.34 --> 1215.1689999999999
I like it like that yeah fruits are nice

1231.669 --> 1234.669
hmm

1236.82 --> 1247.01
yeah here for now that's a good point I

1240.47 --> 1249.54
I used that concept for myself as well

1247.01 --> 1253.22
when I started out eating organic

1249.54 --> 1256.83
because yeah it is more expensive but

1253.22 --> 1260.33
the actual nourishment that it provides

1256.83 --> 1263.27
and the problems that that prevents

1260.33 --> 1266.76
altogether makes it actually cheaper

1263.27 --> 1270.18
gosh you don't you're not gonna stuff

1266.76 --> 1273.99
yourself with [ __ ] all the time and

1270.18 --> 1277.53
candy and crap that goes away slowly if

1273.99 --> 1280.08
you do right and you will not have so

1277.53 --> 1283.8
many medical problems over the course of

1280.08 --> 1285.84
your life from that period um so it'll

1283.8 --> 1291.1499999999999
save your cause it'll save your medical

1285.84 --> 1294.6299999999999
costs and yeah that it's a good it's a

1291.15 --> 1298.74
well worth investment so eating organic

1294.63 --> 1300.93
really is better but you need to change

1298.74 --> 1304.32
your mindset you need to be more aware

1300.93 --> 1307.14
and more responsible for your eating

1304.32 --> 1311.9099999999999
impulses and for the way you regard it

1307.14 --> 1313.6200000000001
you can't you can't really afford using

1311.91 --> 1320.16
food as some kind of psychological

1313.62 --> 1322.4399999999998
escapism anymore I guess you could under

1320.16 --> 1324.96
controlled circumstances or under

1322.44 --> 1327.0900000000001
self-imposed rules still do that at

1324.96 --> 1329.31
times but that just makes everything

1327.09 --> 1332.49
worse it makes it harder to managing

1329.31 --> 1336.27
yourself and to keep your discipline so

1332.49 --> 1339.81
it's better to just discards the habit

1336.27 --> 1342.45
of gorging on things as some kind of

1339.81 --> 1344.25
escapist thing you like to do it's

1342.45 --> 1345.42
better to just completely discard that

1344.25 --> 1349.53
forever

1345.42 --> 1352.43
and once you no longer have that you

1349.53 --> 1356.12
will never regret some dropping that

1352.43 --> 1356.1200000000001
even though yeah

1357.539 --> 1365.97
it might seem like something you really

1359.789 --> 1368.57
miss when you still do it but I'll bet

1365.97 --> 1373.34
that they'll not turn out to be the case

1368.57 --> 1373.34
eventually if you hold fast

1398.47 --> 1407.23
the food isn't naturally laughing well

1402.72 --> 1410.92
the food itself is non-natural

1407.23 --> 1415.51
endorphine but consumption and eating

1410.92 --> 1419.47
and metabolism doesn't have endorphin

1415.51 --> 1423.72
related aspects about it that's part of

1419.47 --> 1433.44
the reward system to make a creature

1423.72 --> 1433.44
keep on eating so yes but not literally

1438.27 --> 1441.27
grazie

1442.89 --> 1447.97
yeah and hey endorphines

1445.24 --> 1453.01
it is like a hormonal kind of substance

1447.97 --> 1456.3700000000001
and that substance needs to come from

1453.01 --> 1458.35
somewhere it doesn't just create itself

1456.37 --> 1465.07
out of thin air so you gotta have the

1458.35 --> 1466.75
right vitamins and fats especially fats

1465.07 --> 1470.08
are important to aura all hormonal

1466.75 --> 1473.38
systems and the right minerals all

1470.08 --> 1476.9499999999998
combined and the conditions to be able

1473.38 --> 1478.3600000000001
to produce these hormones in whatever

1476.95 --> 1481.23
glands they're going to be produced

1478.36 --> 1488.59
whether it be in the brain or in any

1481.23 --> 1491.5
other part of the body so yeah if you

1488.59 --> 1497.74
eat the right things then your hormonal

1491.5 --> 1501.58
system will stay up to capacity and if

1497.74 --> 1505.81
you don't do it then it's not gonna be

1501.58 --> 1508.4399999999998
as much up to capacity or slower it's

1505.81 --> 1511.21
more long winded building process and

1508.44 --> 1516.3400000000001
this is also by the way something that I

1511.21 --> 1518.56
have considered when taking into mind

1516.34 --> 1521.1999999999998
breath that arianism like how does that

1518.56 --> 1522.1599999999999
really work out because I've talked a

1521.2 --> 1524.89
lot about it

1522.16 --> 1532.8100000000002
with my dad for example and with my ear

1524.89 --> 1535.8100000000002
even just the general concerns like okay

1532.81 --> 1538.98
uniques but the concept is our unique

1535.81 --> 1543.1299999999999
glucose and air and water to survive

1538.98 --> 1547.0
okay so supposedly the mana will give

1543.13 --> 1549.2800000000002
the glucose but yeah how does the rest

1547.0 --> 1555.76
of your body basically get the more

1549.28 --> 1559.27
complex substances and it is said by

1555.76 --> 1561.22
breath Terri anism and these people dug

1559.27 --> 1563.8899999999999
into it read into it a lot more than I

1561.22 --> 1565.6000000000001
have my dad and my healer a lot more so

1563.89 --> 1569.14
I barely know anything I just touched

1565.6 --> 1572.77
the surface of it they say that the body

1569.14 --> 1575.21
just self creates it through the state

1572.77 --> 1579.25
through the same way mana

1575.21 --> 1587.27
comes into being because of the serenity

1579.25 --> 1588.2
as I have no answer to that like yeah

1587.27 --> 1592.6589999999999
could be true

1588.2 --> 1597.25
why makes everything so confusing

1592.659 --> 1600.5590000000002
because of the well let's just call it a

1597.25 --> 1609.47
presupposition that living organisms do

1600.559 --> 1613.6299999999999
need external things to survive or maybe

1609.47 --> 1616.52
that is a thing that has become almost

1613.63 --> 1620.48
culturally conditioned integrated into

1616.52 --> 1624.44
our species and it's not really

1620.48 --> 1627.2
necessary or another Theory angle is

1624.44 --> 1629.539
like yeah it is an adaptability concept

1627.2 --> 1632.1200000000001
that humans have because of their higher

1629.539 --> 1634.58
consciousness on the relative that we

1632.12 --> 1637.85
can actually adapt to non eating if it

1634.58 --> 1642.9189999999999
is required but that it is not our

1637.85 --> 1645.799
default central position of our genetics

1642.919 --> 1649.1000000000001
it's just like some animals could

1645.799 --> 1651.799
potentially adapt to extreme cold

1649.1 --> 1653.57
conditions we can adapt to non-food

1651.799 --> 1657.3799999999999
conditions maybe it is something like

1653.57 --> 1660.9189999999999
that but it would always be then an

1657.38 --> 1663.529
outer limit to our genetic options it

1660.919 --> 1666.95
would not be the central standard in my

1663.529 --> 1672.559
opinion I don't think humans were born

1666.95 --> 1676.3700000000001
not to eat unless that very aspect

1672.559 --> 1681.74
actually stems from a dormant ancient

1676.37 --> 1684.1689999999999
capacity like let's just speculate out

1681.74 --> 1685.85
of thin air there the concept of Adam

1684.169 --> 1690.26
and Eve they if they were in paradise

1685.85 --> 1696.11
they never they didn't need to eat to

1690.26 --> 1699.919
survive right they just needed or they

1696.11 --> 1701.9289999999999
could eat for the pleasure of it now

1699.919 --> 1705.0200000000002
that's interesting to take into mind

1701.929 --> 1706.97
when approaching this so ok they were

1705.02 --> 1708.559
banished from the Keralites and they

1706.97 --> 1713.21
started to eat too

1708.559 --> 1716.029
survive us to counter the hunger well

1713.21 --> 1723.019
maybe we still have maybe breatharianism

1716.029 --> 1726.669
is still the Paradise whole state for

1723.019 --> 1728.779
which we were for the which the original

1726.669 --> 1733.659
blueprints from which we stem were

1728.779 --> 1738.11
designed so maybe it is just a hidden

1733.659 --> 1741.8600000000001
paradise ability as part of our genetic

1738.11 --> 1746.139
blueprint our original one and that's

1741.86 --> 1749.4499999999998
why we can still do it we can basically

1746.139 --> 1751.2199999999998
recreate paradise that state return to

1749.45 --> 1755.419
paradise however you want to see that

1751.22 --> 1758.8990000000001
mentally and then live according to that

1755.419 --> 1763.8200000000002
level and basically not have to eat or

1758.899 --> 1767.6589999999999
just eat enjoy and and live of the

1763.82 --> 1770.9189999999999
energy of the positive energy of God's

1767.659 --> 1776.44
grace could make all it anyway

1770.919 --> 1779.6000000000001
yeah just something to think about

1776.44 --> 1782.8690000000001
breatharianism and the option not to eat

1779.6 --> 1785.4699999999998
and how to regard that within our

1782.869 --> 1785.47
species

1796.94 --> 1804.979
huh right yeah Jeffrey bill

1799.909 --> 1809.47
you have a good point there the THC CBD

1804.979 --> 1812.599
and DMT receptors the docking stations

1809.47 --> 1819.2
that suggest that these substances are

1812.599 --> 1822.32
an integral part a Co existing factor of

1819.2 --> 1825.799
our very design but on the other hand

1822.32 --> 1830.479
you also have to take into account for

1825.799 --> 1833.149
what purpose because were we naturally

1830.479 --> 1838.1290000000001
designed to eat that stuff

1833.149 --> 1846.109
or were these receptors basically made

1838.129 --> 1854.059
part of us to basically help modify our

1846.109 --> 1856.58
minds change us mold us into well let's

1854.059 --> 1860.809
just say to help get the option to

1856.58 --> 1865.1899999999998
suddenly reset society that kind of

1860.809 --> 1867.44
thought using the original knowledge of

1865.19 --> 1871.19
these cyber as I cut robux and what they

1867.44 --> 1873.279
were actually designed for so yeah with

1871.19 --> 1875.659
cannabis the healing factor is very

1873.279 --> 1882.07
critical so I think that one may

1875.659 --> 1885.1390000000001
definitely be original a original plant

1882.07 --> 1890.149
that was just very close to our being

1885.139 --> 1894.4399999999998
always but things like DMT I don't know

1890.149 --> 1898.6999999999998
I don't know if that was always meant to

1894.44 --> 1905.739
be part of our metabolism really I think

1898.7 --> 1905.739
that it might have just always been a

1906.909 --> 1913.429
manipulating mind controlling substance

1909.289 --> 1915.379
it's all a matter of approach look I

1913.429 --> 1919.3090000000002
have don't have a lot of positive

1915.379 --> 1924.1999999999998
experience with that substance so I am

1919.309 --> 1928.399
very I have the tendency to approach it

1924.2 --> 1930.89
from the manipulation substance

1928.399 --> 1933.26
perspective that it is like a

1930.89 --> 1935.69
fail-safe mechanism in our genetics

1933.26 --> 1940.85
maybe even as part of the original

1935.69 --> 1946.1200000000001
blueprint of the designer to moderate

1940.85 --> 1946.12
our being over the ages as it were so

1946.27 --> 1949.75
think about that

1955.26 --> 1966.82
hmm yeah good point there's natural DMT

1961.35 --> 1970.8
taking place as well right so it might

1966.82 --> 1975.75
definitely be a part of our inner

1970.8 --> 1979.51
spiritual development definitely I

1975.75 --> 1982.72
believe that but as an external

1979.51 --> 1987.1
substance because yeah we don't I don't

1982.72 --> 1993.19
believe we do make THC and CBD in our

1987.1 --> 1998.6999999999998
bodies but yeah when it comes to what is

1993.19 --> 1998.7
it again DMT what was it again

2003.21 --> 2016.96
yeah I missed it anyway that substance I

2007.75 --> 2020.2
don't think yeah I don't think that is

2016.96 --> 2026.47
substance that is just that was supposed

2020.2 --> 2029.95
to always be a part besides the little

2026.47 --> 2036.8500000000001
amounts that do happen naturally in the

2029.95 --> 2038.13
brain every time I've been confronted

2036.85 --> 2043.4199999999998
with it

2038.13 --> 2046.5600000000002
it always had just severe and very

2043.42 --> 2050.7400000000002
unnatural seeming effect on me

2046.56 --> 2054.16
miraculous at times maybe but like the

2050.74 --> 2062.5
overall sensation was just like this is

2054.16 --> 2066.3999999999996
all out of place or maybe that was just

2062.5 --> 2068.8
the personal state of being I was in at

2066.4 --> 2072.58
the times when that happened and that

2068.8 --> 2075.1000000000004
was aggravated that was shove in my face

2072.58 --> 2079.87
that I just very much felt out of place

2075.1 --> 2081.61
and that sensation was just aggravated a

2079.87 --> 2083.7999999999997
lot during during a lot of the

2081.61 --> 2086.34
experience that could be that could be I

2083.8 --> 2086.34
don't know

2086.7 --> 2099.24
yeah and I've heard that DMT is satanic

2090.419 --> 2106.14
well I can neither confirm nor deny that

2099.24 --> 2109.3799999999997
because I do think that satanic people

2106.14 --> 2109.3799999999997
abuse it

2113.259 --> 2120.89
but to declare it all out right satanic

2117.89 --> 2123.2
I don't know I I don't agree to that I

2120.89 --> 2127.609
think there are good ways to apply it as

2123.2 --> 2130.97
I said if you're extremely careful but

2127.609 --> 2133.519
and not just a little just it is a big

2130.97 --> 2135.47
deal always so you got to be extremely

2133.519 --> 2143.6899999999996
careful and prepared and mentally stable

2135.47 --> 2148.839
and focused so yeah satanic not

2143.69 --> 2148.839
necessarily dangerous yes very much so

2153.249 --> 2159.91
right so look I will not have this

2159.94 --> 2168.19
stupid overgeneralization devil

2163.4 --> 2172.279
persecution crap here okay I I may be

2168.19 --> 2176.18
Christian in my own in my own mind at

2172.279 --> 2178.009
least I follow the path but yeah all

2176.18 --> 2181.8799999999997
this devil persecution and calling

2178.009 --> 2186.47
everything satanic that's yeah that's

2181.88 --> 2189.0190000000002
wrong it's not good it's no use

2186.47 --> 2192.4399999999996
it's just cutting you off from

2189.019 --> 2196.1899999999996
everything preventing you from actually

2192.44 --> 2201.079
understanding what it is may spare you

2196.19 --> 2203.66
from some seduction that you have not

2201.079 --> 2206.059
learned to resist using your inner

2203.66 --> 2207.5589999999997
discipline and that way you can avoid

2206.059 --> 2210.17
that all the time

2207.559 --> 2211.9700000000003
at the same time yeah it's not gonna

2210.17 --> 2214.13
help you you're not gonna learn that

2211.97 --> 2216.14
discipline and you're not going to

2214.13 --> 2220.759
understand what you're basically fending

2216.14 --> 2222.6189999999997
off so you're gonna they're gonna make

2220.759 --> 2225.7
everything into your enemy when you do

2222.619 --> 2228.349
that eventually can you see everybody

2225.7 --> 2231.71
betray you because they don't agree with

2228.349 --> 2235.13
you on your view that something is the

2231.71 --> 2236.7200000000003
devil so yeah consider that it's not

2235.13 --> 2242.4300000000003
healthy it's not part of the path of

2236.72 --> 2249.0899999999997
Christ's path is to understand

2242.43 --> 2252.7
not just to attack an attempt to remove

2249.09 --> 2255.9700000000003
and a solve it down good

2252.7 --> 2264.93
don't try to surgically remove it that's

2255.97 --> 2264.93
better on average right

2274.88 --> 2281.73
so look let me tell you something in

2277.71 --> 2290.07
general about all these disciplines

2281.73 --> 2292.68
about yoga meditation Kundalini all

2290.07 --> 2295.8
these disciplines from all kinds of

2292.68 --> 2297.71
cultures that enhance spiritual energy

2295.8 --> 2302.07
that enhance all these things you can do

2297.71 --> 2305.93
it all has the same consequences and

2302.07 --> 2309.81
that is what is going to be done with

2305.93 --> 2311.1
the gained spiritual energy the gain

2309.81 --> 2315.7799999999997
spiritual strength

2311.1 --> 2317.88
how will it be wielded because yeah you

2315.78 --> 2323.48
can think oh this guy is becoming a

2317.88 --> 2326.9100000000003
shaman or yogi and that's really nice

2323.48 --> 2329.4900000000002
this becoming wiser smarter oh and then

2326.91 --> 2331.29
you might be very inclined to over

2329.49 --> 2333.6299999999997
generalize and assume that everything

2331.29 --> 2338.22
about them is just all fine and dandy

2333.63 --> 2345.7200000000003
but yeah gaining spiritual power also

2338.22 --> 2350.5499999999997
means getting closer to the opposition

2345.72 --> 2353.6099999999997
in a way that the brighter you shine the

2350.55 --> 2356.55
more painful the more a needle in the

2353.61 --> 2358.77
eye of the dark ones you become and they

2356.55 --> 2360.36
will try to meddle with you they will

2358.77 --> 2362.55
try to seduce you that's what they

2360.36 --> 2364.53
always do it's it's the consequence of

2362.55 --> 2368.4300000000003
power it is the standard effect of power

2364.53 --> 2371.34
whether it be like Authority power or

2368.43 --> 2374.66
whether it be energy power or whether it

2371.34 --> 2379.6800000000003
be brilliant inside any kind of power

2374.66 --> 2382.5299999999997
will lead being tempted by the dark

2379.68 --> 2385.46
forces into corruption it is the

2382.53 --> 2389.88
standard consequence of power it is a

2385.46 --> 2391.71
part of the design of this world is the

2389.88 --> 2395.88
power corruption effect and it applies

2391.71 --> 2397.71
to everything so even with a yogi you

2395.88 --> 2399.2400000000002
can assume that everything is good just

2397.71 --> 2401.37
gotta be findings gonna be like a

2399.24 --> 2401.9399999999996
typical yogi and it's nice and it's all

2401.37 --> 2405.69
good

2401.94 --> 2408.36
what you gotta keep in mind that day

2405.69 --> 2411.84
are in a battle themselves like if they

2408.36 --> 2414.1200000000003
really are that powerful opposing the

2411.84 --> 2416.25
other sides and trying to resolve the

2414.12 --> 2419.52
remnants of their own personal inner

2416.25 --> 2424.86
workings to make themselves even

2419.52 --> 2427.47
stronger and I think that a lot of these

2424.86 --> 2430.08
types of people tend to present

2427.47 --> 2434.7
themselves as perfect as serene and it

2430.08 --> 2437.16
has a placebo positive side effect

2434.7 --> 2439.5299999999997
because if it's a spiritual person you

2437.16 --> 2442.56
do present yourself as flawless and like

2439.53 --> 2444.9
yeah I can absolutely I know anything

2442.56 --> 2449.87
I've already passed these stages that

2444.9 --> 2454.2000000000003
people will give you a lot of energy and

2449.87 --> 2456.99
it go basically also strengthen the

2454.2 --> 2460.3199999999997
belief and the way to suppress this but

2456.99 --> 2462.45
it doesn't actually solve the problem if

2460.32 --> 2464.04
you really haven't held it so it can

2462.45 --> 2468.4199999999996
assist you but you still have to deal

2464.04 --> 2470.64
with it so these are the things that

2468.42 --> 2472.86
actually go on also with spiritual

2470.64 --> 2478.85
people that I have also I have met

2472.86 --> 2482.4900000000002
Yogi's and people like Wikipedia groups

2478.85 --> 2488.73
pretty pretty decent people it's not

2482.49 --> 2490.8599999999997
like creepy and shamans and yeah the

2488.73 --> 2495.68
more power you have the more insight you

2490.86 --> 2500.34
have the more spiritual energy the more

2495.68 --> 2506.8199999999997
counter force exists to try to derail

2500.34 --> 2510.71
you it's just how it works it's the

2506.82 --> 2510.71
consequence of power any type of power

2511.88 --> 2521.15
out here yeah

2514.38 --> 2521.15
PJ is gonna drop the ball hasn't he

2529.88 --> 2532.9190000000003
[Music]

2536.19 --> 2546.48
all right okay Kevin Evert advert asks

2540.81 --> 2546.48
Pete and zinger trolls are schizophrenic

2549.6 --> 2558.46
Zener is trolling I think I really think

2553.42 --> 2560.76
he is it might have been like an axe

2558.46 --> 2563.26
that got out of control

2560.76 --> 2565.78
serious that can happen like I thought

2563.26 --> 2569.71
okay I'm gonna do this and then he kind

2565.78 --> 2571.57
of accidentally got caught in opposition

2569.71 --> 2574.06
that he couldn't wiggle out of or it

2571.57 --> 2578.32
just didn't want to or who knows what

2574.06 --> 2581.08
happened I think he was basically

2578.32 --> 2584.17
trolling but who knows maybe he does

2581.08 --> 2586.5699999999997
have massive kind of peer pressure of

2584.17 --> 2589.9500000000003
girlfriend or whatever and he's just

2586.57 --> 2592.63
like okay I have to get out now so just

2589.95 --> 2594.48
cover my tracks and just pretend like

2592.63 --> 2605.28
I'm not a flat earther anymore who knows

2594.48 --> 2608.35
as 4pj schizophrenic I don't know it's

2605.28 --> 2614.1600000000003
maybe a bit over generalization but he

2608.35 --> 2618.43
has all kinds of neurotic problems and

2614.16 --> 2621.22
growing up problems like very silly

2618.43 --> 2623.56
childish behavior that he does not

2621.22 --> 2625.72
migrate on and that he refuses to take

2623.56 --> 2628.21
responsibility for and I could almost

2625.72 --> 2632.74
literally see him banging his head

2628.21 --> 2637.3
against the wall bloodying just not to

2632.74 --> 2640.45
let certain things sink in and I would

2637.3 --> 2643.36
probably push him that far I could like

2640.45 --> 2647.4399999999996
really like yeah you can think whatever

2643.36 --> 2650.92
you can dream whatever but you are like

2647.44 --> 2653.44
socially underdeveloped you do have

2650.92 --> 2658.1800000000003
extremely childish aspects of you that

2653.44 --> 2662.11
are inexcusable there is nothing to

2658.18 --> 2667.0
excuse that from existing nothing it is

2662.11 --> 2669.26
absolutely shameful by all measures that

2667.0 --> 2673.09
he has that type of behavior

2669.26 --> 2676.4300000000003
and he needs to really work on it and

2673.09 --> 2678.5
I'll be a [ __ ] about it I'd be a little

2676.43 --> 2680.99
whiny girl about it not be a victim

2678.5 --> 2685.49
about it and just confront himself and

2680.99 --> 2688.3999999999996
say okay this is wrong I have to stop

2685.49 --> 2690.1699999999996
doing this because it's getting me

2688.4 --> 2693.65
nowhere and everybody just freakin hates

2690.17 --> 2696.65
me over this and I can just fill that up

2693.65 --> 2699.6800000000003
with illusions not to notice not to feel

2696.65 --> 2701.96
the heard of it but that only works for

2699.68 --> 2703.85
you and it makes things worse it makes

2701.96 --> 2711.05
you more delusional more detached from

2703.85 --> 2720.0499999999997
the actual reality so bad stop it stop

2711.05 --> 2724.27
it people a chocolates sayin the greed

2720.05 --> 2724.27
isn't chat we have Karen B of course

2727.33 --> 2740.54
Cleary flat earth welcome guys so yeah I

2734.39 --> 2744.25
dude you can't just let me keep on doing

2740.54 --> 2746.81
one-hour monologues like two or three

2744.25 --> 2748.46
flat earth early birds in a row you know

2746.81 --> 2756.08
this is getting kind of annoying

2748.46 --> 2759.82
I need guests damn it get on here it's

2756.08 --> 2759.8199999999997
just 15 minutes you know

2765.58 --> 2775.96
and I know I am filling up the ham it's

2770.83 --> 2779.5
just it's so much better just talking to

2775.96 --> 2784.5
guests and not having to fill up the

2779.5 --> 2784.5
time constantly with with my talking

2788.76 --> 2796.32
anyway I am going to probably today and

2792.99 --> 2799.08
tomorrow start to figure out OBS

2796.32 --> 2801.3900000000003
property and reformat the flat earth

2799.08 --> 2804.36
early-bird show and my any other type of

2801.39 --> 2809.97
future hangouts I may do so I'm looking

2804.36 --> 2813.06
forward to that I hope you too and then

2809.97 --> 2816.14
I'd probably get guests a lot easier

2813.06 --> 2818.87
from that point on

2816.14 --> 2822.45
depending on how soon I can get that

2818.87 --> 2824.88
security set up to work properly might

2822.45 --> 2826.56
take a little longer before that I don't

2824.88 --> 2830.2200000000003
know I don't know how hard it is I think

2826.56 --> 2834.75
I don't thinks it's not that complicated

2830.22 --> 2839.8399999999997
so we'll probably get done right after

2834.75 --> 2839.84
the weekend anyway

2850.26 --> 2859.69
schedule your streams would be

2854.98 --> 2863.2
interesting to know how that works like

2859.69 --> 2865.78
I can I haven't found any kind of repeat

2863.2 --> 2867.37
function for hangouts I don't know why

2865.78 --> 2870.3100000000004
it should be very easy to do but there's

2867.37 --> 2872.29
just no options in YouTube to do that so

2870.31 --> 2875.7999999999997
I have to just reprogram the same

2872.29 --> 2878.59
hangout copy-paste all the content in

2875.8 --> 2882.3700000000003
making a new hangout which i do like a

2878.59 --> 2884.44
day ahead of time or two hours or an

2882.37 --> 2889.5099999999998
hour ahead of time depending on when i

2884.44 --> 2893.44
think of it but maybe yeah maybe OBS

2889.51 --> 2895.84
will be or maybe Adam will help me

2893.44 --> 2898.51
figure out how to do that as well

2895.84 --> 2905.9100000000003
or make things a lot easier it could

2898.51 --> 2905.9100000000003
just be standardized hey Nathan Oakley

2909.56 --> 2920.14
yeah also the mic I kind of do need

2914.72 --> 2920.14
about mic obscure thingy

2932.67 --> 2940.049
and yeah until then I'll just have to

2935.13 --> 2943.71
try not to breathe out because I don't

2940.049 --> 2945.9
notice that when I do that I think it's

2943.71 --> 2947.63
going like downwards right past the

2945.9 --> 2950.73
Micra it's actually going pretty much

2947.63 --> 2953.73
right past the mic making a lot of noise

2950.73 --> 2956.43
I don't realize that I just have moments

2953.73 --> 2959.4900000000002
that I typically breathe out as part of

2956.43 --> 2962.609
my inner tension management part of my

2959.49 --> 2964.859
the way I talk and it is really stupid I

2962.609 --> 2968.839
am annoyed by a little girl when I

2964.859 --> 2972.119
listen back so I really need like the

2968.839 --> 2975.39
proper mic setup as well it shouldn't be

2972.119 --> 2977.67
too difficult but yeah still on the edge

2975.39 --> 2982.14
of being broke at this moment hey

2977.67 --> 2988.64
chocolate saying hey thanks for popping

2982.14 --> 2995.0989999999997

3065.64 --> 3074.64
weeks and he tells that were introduced

3072.17 --> 3080.039
destroying the place and everything it's

3074.64 --> 3083.49
it's a talent it's worried where were

3080.039 --> 3088.17
you left my Owen like you know our iron

3083.49 --> 3091.3799999999997
realm had a big old show were they

3088.17 --> 3094.71
pretty much had like I don't know maybe

3091.38 --> 3097.9500000000003
I couldn't even tell you how many people

3094.71 --> 3101.039
they call it out to but they had like a

3097.95 --> 3104.609
four-hour hang up and it was crazy

3101.039 --> 3107.67
I completely missed out and I was with

3104.609 --> 3112.769
my with the gamers and then afterward I

3107.67 --> 3115.17
was like you were you would be yeah big

3112.769 --> 3117.269
time and it was like look I was

3115.17 --> 3119.839
basically almost doing like a hangout

3117.269 --> 3124.14
where I'd have to interactively

3119.839 --> 3128.46
interactively act and oversee like a

3124.14 --> 3131.7889999999998
giant societal structure and politics

3128.46 --> 3137.5190000000002
and angles to it all of that at once for

3131.789 --> 3140.96
at least four hours in a row maybe a

3137.519 --> 3143.609
10-minute break at some point this

3140.96 --> 3146.369
hangouts beside the three-hour hangout I

3143.609 --> 3151.47
did in the first part of the day okay so

3146.369 --> 3154.6800000000003
yeah it is very gratifying but it also

3151.47 --> 3157.98
takes so much focus energies so

3154.68 --> 3159.96
afterwards combination with the alcohol

3157.98 --> 3165.329
that I hadn't that didn't hit too well

3159.96 --> 3167.819
it's just completely like yeah just a

3165.329 --> 3171.2690000000002
few smokes watch Star Trek Voyager

3167.819 --> 3172.859
episodes and then just crash to bed and

3171.269 --> 3175.859
I'm said he was trying to reach out to

3172.859 --> 3180.38
you a few times but you know yeah I

3175.859 --> 3186.089
didn't even open up sky and it got back

3180.38 --> 3188.6400000000003
she's but yeah I guess I will take a

3186.089 --> 3190.619
look at that hangout if it was really

3188.64 --> 3192.9
that interesting I'll see if I can find

3190.619 --> 3196.4
some points where I can take a look at

3192.9 --> 3196.4
it too bad I missed it but yeah

3197.6 --> 3203.7
nice check it out it was it was

3201.03 --> 3207.0600000000004
literally like an online party that's

3203.7 --> 3209.85
what it felt like cool very good fives

3207.06 --> 3213.81
very good but everybody was just showing

3209.85 --> 3218.4
that love to everybody else was for my

3213.81 --> 3221.07
son it's a cool thing about flatters you

3218.4 --> 3224.01
know the only people we have problems

3221.07 --> 3226.01
with are the patrols and that's not even

3224.01 --> 3233.8700000000003
a problem sometimes that's fun

3226.01 --> 3237.5600000000004
so would that be

3233.87 --> 3253.25
hey everything has a time and a place

3237.56 --> 3264.42
yes sir Eric my machine matrix media

3253.25 --> 3270.42
well guys what do you talk about earlier

3264.42 --> 3278.34
oh I talked about a cat that has adopted

3270.42 --> 3280.38
me and and I talked about that's crazy

3278.34 --> 3285.81
I've been talking for like 45 minutes

3280.38 --> 3289.4100000000003
and I forgot what about I think food I

3285.81 --> 3291.6
think a lot about food right and ID and

3289.41 --> 3292.62
a little bit more about berthed Arianism

3291.6 --> 3295.41
where it might be coming from

3292.62 --> 3298.5899999999997
genetically so I think most of it was

3295.41 --> 3303.0299999999997
food and then a little bit about

3298.59 --> 3305.55
spirituality ayahuasca and cannabis and

3303.03 --> 3308.8500000000004
all the receptors and what it could be

3305.55 --> 3310.38
as part of our design so yeah talked a

3308.85 --> 3315.5699999999997
lot about that it was quite interesting

3310.38 --> 3317.67
what arrived in my gaze while I was

3315.57 --> 3320.04
