84.56 --> 87.52
and knead it

91.68 --> 96.56
let's check out the weather

93.84 --> 99.119
it just started raining it's been very

96.56 --> 101.84
cloudy and windy

99.119 --> 101.84
all morning

104.88 --> 110.079
this is the first time the the rain is

106.96 --> 110.079
breaking through though

112.159 --> 115.92
right

115.119 --> 119.84
so

115.92 --> 119.84
plants are getting water today

121.36 --> 125.479
it's kind of restless weather

130.0 --> 133.28
right

132.16 --> 135.76
hello

133.28 --> 139.36
return to normal first in chat clutch

135.76 --> 141.599
bear terminoid areas the curse of man

139.36 --> 143.20000000000002
all right

141.599 --> 147.11999999999998
good to see you

143.2 --> 147.11999999999998
got in there quickly that's nice

147.599 --> 156.2
right

149.28 --> 156.2
it is friday the 27th of august 2021

159.04 --> 163.2
i have no idea what kind of a show this

161.12 --> 165.92000000000002
is going to be

163.2 --> 169.28
i hope it's going to be

165.92 --> 169.28
less long towed

169.68 --> 174.48000000000002
then it was yesterday

171.92 --> 178.39999999999998
i didn't watch yesterday's show back

174.48 --> 178.39999999999998
but i did think about it a lot

180.48 --> 184.28
a rope l

189.2 --> 195.04
but yeah i think there there was in

191.44 --> 195.04
general just something in the air

195.599 --> 200.48
just this agitated thing it's it wasn't

198.0 --> 200.48
just me

200.8 --> 208.87900000000002
i tried to not let myself go too much

204.879 --> 211.28
but yeah it was blatantly obvious

208.879 --> 212.48
recipients in the chat

211.28 --> 216.0
were also

212.48 --> 216.0
just very triggered

216.239 --> 221.20000000000002
like tom parker lit literally just blew

218.72 --> 225.48
a gasket

221.2 --> 225.48
taking star wars not

226.4 --> 230.159
but she did like cross a line and i i

228.799 --> 231.76000000000002
really needed to

230.159 --> 233.84
make that clear

231.76 --> 235.51899999999998
but yeah on the flat earth debates too

233.84 --> 238.56
like there was just a

235.519 --> 240.87900000000002
more freak friction

238.56 --> 243.28
elijah had a lot of trouble just getting

240.879 --> 246.64
through like he had sort of like

243.28 --> 248.72
almost arwenian impatience

246.64 --> 251.2
i get like that too sometimes it was

248.72 --> 254.48
kind of weird hearing that

251.2 --> 257.28
he like the frequency of it he had a bit

254.48 --> 257.28
issues with that

258.16 --> 262.639
but i thought that i was able to very

260.4 --> 264.71999999999997
much keep everything under control

262.639 --> 266.0
during the flat earth debates

264.72 --> 268.32000000000005
[Music]

266.0 --> 270.56
and it was overall an interesting show

268.32 --> 272.479
and a long after show again so that was

270.56 --> 274.479
nice

272.479 --> 276.71999999999997
like at least one and a half hour

274.479 --> 276.71999999999997
uh

277.52 --> 281.12
yeah the people messing around with the

279.199 --> 283.91900000000004
subscribers yeah

281.12 --> 286.479
it's okay new man you know why

283.919 --> 288.32
because i literally

286.479 --> 290.4
forecast it

288.32 --> 292.4
like it's like the weather report to me

290.4 --> 294.84
it's like yeah

292.4 --> 297.19899999999996
yeah that's gonna come that's what

294.84 --> 298.479
happens you know

297.199 --> 301.28000000000003
when there's an air pressure

298.479 --> 303.919
differential caused by whatever it's

301.28 --> 306.479
that means there's going to be wind

303.919 --> 309.12
right it's just a forecast you know how

306.479 --> 310.639
this works so i'm reaching that moment i

309.12 --> 312.16
knew they were going to do that they did

310.639 --> 314.479
it last time

312.16 --> 318.0
they've done it every single time i got

314.479 --> 319.039
kind of enthusiastic for some rounded up

318.0 --> 320.8
number

319.039 --> 322.96
that i was going to reach even before

320.8 --> 326.16
the thousand subscribers

322.96 --> 328.08
very early on it's

326.16 --> 330.24
they just know how that works and they

328.08 --> 331.039
can't help themselves and i'm okay with

330.24 --> 333.36
that

331.039 --> 335.039
because what really matters is the

333.36 --> 337.12
quality

335.039 --> 340.639
of my output

337.12 --> 343.52
and the quality of the chat the people

340.639 --> 344.88
in chat right you're my real

343.52 --> 348.0
wealth

344.88 --> 350.0
it's not that number

348.0 --> 353.36
on my youtube page

350.0 --> 355.759
it's the participation you're my real

353.36 --> 355.759
wealth

355.919 --> 359.75899999999996
and that's how i try to treat things

360.88 --> 365.44
they are serious at yeah well just

363.759 --> 367.84000000000003
let them weep

365.44 --> 367.84
you know

371.68 --> 376.40000000000003
don't lower yourself

373.52 --> 376.4
just let them weep

377.52 --> 381.44
right

379.6 --> 383.44
i see it like that

381.44 --> 386.08
like when trolls are like really

383.44 --> 388.96
seriously squirting

386.08 --> 391.84
i don't see them like some little devil

388.96 --> 395.12
or anything i know that's like part of

391.84 --> 398.08
of the frequencies but i also know that

395.12 --> 400.8
they actually are crying inside so just

398.08 --> 404.96
let them weep

400.8 --> 404.96000000000004
did i just stumble upon a new title

405.919 --> 409.84
huh

407.6 --> 413.72
i really got this weird theme thing

409.84 --> 413.71999999999997
going in last week

420.99 --> 430.839
[Music]

423.75 --> 430.839
[Applause]

445.199 --> 450.88
hey cleary did i see owen benjamin's

449.36 --> 453.68
12 12

450.88 --> 453.68
i think so

455.52 --> 461.19899999999996
dude owen benjamin's has done like a lot

458.4 --> 463.52
of really good information streams like

461.199 --> 466.40000000000003
including in the spirit mechanics and

463.52 --> 466.4
esoterics

467.919 --> 473.12
like that guy gets it and i really

470.4 --> 475.67999999999995
appreciate what he does i feel it it

473.12 --> 477.52
complements me and i hope in some way i

475.68 --> 478.479
compliment him

477.52 --> 479.75899999999996
and that

478.479 --> 481.599
i don't know i don't know if he even

479.759 --> 483.12
knows i exist

481.599 --> 484.4
like in a bigger part of his

483.12 --> 486.479
consciousness but maybe his

484.4 --> 489.599
subconsciousness

486.479 --> 490.87899999999996
is in league with my subconsciousness i

489.599 --> 492.639
think there's like this whole

490.879 --> 495.03900000000004
subconscious

492.639 --> 496.16
alternative reality that's hidden from

495.039 --> 498.08
us

496.16 --> 501.12
that does its own work and i've been

498.08 --> 504.12
trying to figure out how that even works

501.12 --> 504.12
right

507.039 --> 511.52
and own benjamin has

509.44 --> 514.32
expressed

511.52 --> 517.919
that mechanic so i'm confident that he

514.32 --> 521.599
is aware that it exists too and he is

517.919 --> 523.12
working with it also

521.599 --> 525.519
but i don't know if he even knows

523.12 --> 528.32
consciously i exist it doesn't matter

525.519 --> 531.92
really right once you get really zoned

528.32 --> 531.9200000000001
into those mechanics

532.48 --> 536.64
it doesn't matter anymore really

534.959 --> 538.2399999999999
you can just do your own thing if you

536.64 --> 540.16
just focus on

538.24 --> 543.04
the frequency inside

540.16 --> 545.8389999999999
you will start to resonate

543.04 --> 548.7199999999999
it's that's the real synchronicity right

545.839 --> 551.12
synchronicity is not just like

548.72 --> 553.519
oh you just talk about a word or guess

551.12 --> 556.16
what somebody brings up that word

553.519 --> 559.04
right at the same second right that's

556.16 --> 560.64
really basic stuff that's just like a

559.04 --> 562.64
little bit

560.64 --> 564.399
a little spark

562.64 --> 566.08
that's basic stuff the real

564.399 --> 568.64
synchronicity

566.08 --> 571.0400000000001
happens when you really try to focus

568.64 --> 572.72
inward on your inner frequency

571.04 --> 574.8
and literally just

572.72 --> 577.839
start to ignore everything else

574.8 --> 577.8389999999999
frequency wise

578.72 --> 584.399
that's when you attune

580.64 --> 587.81
it has a word you know a tuning

584.399 --> 591.839
it like a tuning fork a tuning

587.81 --> 594.88
[Music]

591.839 --> 597.6800000000001
and then you get the real synchronicity

594.88 --> 599.68
you start to follow the same steps

597.68 --> 601.12
automatically even though you never know

599.68 --> 604.7199999999999
each other and then

601.12 --> 608.079
this is like how the real inspiring

604.72 --> 610.1600000000001
personal miracles happen in ways is that

608.079 --> 612.7199999999999
you are on a path you're on a mission

610.16 --> 614.24
and then like at three quarters you've

612.72 --> 617.12
gone through all the struggle this is

614.24 --> 619.12
even in stories like recognized

617.12 --> 621.519
storytelling tradition like that's an

619.12 --> 623.279
effect that's something that's real

621.519 --> 624.72
and it's really

623.279 --> 627.8389999999999
glorious

624.72 --> 627.839
you go on this path

627.92 --> 632.8
you attune you sharpen you overcome the

630.72 --> 635.36
obstacle personal obstacles you become

632.8 --> 638.079
greater and then at the end

635.36 --> 640.16
you suddenly find you have all kinds of

638.079 --> 642.16
brothers or sisters that are like on

640.16 --> 643.36
that same path and you

642.16 --> 645.36
agree

643.36 --> 647.6
on everything that matters even though

645.36 --> 648.72
you've never heard of them before

647.6 --> 650.64
right

648.72 --> 653.44
that stuff

650.64 --> 655.519
is part of the mechanics

653.44 --> 657.6
it's part of god's design that it works

655.519 --> 659.76
that way and i think that we're already

657.6 --> 661.839
experiencing it it's just that this is a

659.76 --> 664.399
weird internet age

661.839 --> 666.32
where you could compare it that anybody

664.399 --> 669.04
that's

666.32 --> 670.32
attempting to be very serious

669.04 --> 672.48
with god

670.32 --> 673.6800000000001
could be metaphorically considered like

672.48 --> 675.279
a priest

673.68 --> 677.519
chanting of a roof like in some

675.279 --> 680.16
religions they literally do that

677.519 --> 682.5600000000001
well the internet makes it that you can

680.16 --> 684.8
chant of a roof and literally it reaches

682.56 --> 688.68
everywhere on the world

684.8 --> 688.68
that has an open line

688.8 --> 693.04
and that's kind of unique about this age

693.68 --> 700.0
but even way back when that wasn't there

697.44 --> 701.44
it would already have like a profound

700.0 --> 704.72
frequency

701.44 --> 704.72
influencing effect

706.88 --> 711.399
and it probably still does anyway

716.16 --> 719.76
right i'm gonna adapt that title

720.48 --> 723.6
just let them weep

723.68 --> 729.279
and stay

725.6 --> 731.839
tuned i like it

729.279 --> 731.8389999999999
oh

740.16 --> 744.639
praise be to god

742.16 --> 747.959
how do i come up with that [ __ ] it's got

744.639 --> 747.9590000000001
to be god

758.079 --> 762.16
did a good video on simon then yeah i

759.76 --> 763.8389999999999
was live i i was actually there for half

762.16 --> 765.279
of it

763.839 --> 766.32
because i got up pretty early this

765.279 --> 770.6
morning

766.32 --> 770.6
so it's really starting to work

789.44 --> 792.5600000000001
right

790.48 --> 797.32
so yeah

792.56 --> 797.3199999999999
plenty of gravy to go around

805.839 --> 812.0790000000001
but remember yeah the trolls it's like a

808.8 --> 815.399
fractal but it's a fractal inward into a

812.079 --> 815.399
dark place

815.76 --> 819.68
getting louder as it gets closer to the

818.56 --> 822.0
bottom

819.68 --> 826.279
to keep your attention

822.0 --> 826.279
but it doesn't really help you

829.279 --> 834.079
just let them wheel weep

832.399 --> 836.56
and stay tuned

834.079 --> 838.8
stay tuned in

836.56 --> 839.92
keep track of what is what what is

838.8 --> 842.4799999999999
happening

839.92 --> 843.92
right just don't let them

842.48 --> 845.519
pull you in

843.92 --> 847.4399999999999
like that

845.519 --> 849.279
and it's very tough to

847.44 --> 851.2790000000001
to even

849.279 --> 853.04
know when that actually happens

851.279 --> 854.72
sometimes

853.04 --> 856.639
but if you notice that that happened

854.72 --> 858.72
then afterward

856.639 --> 861.199
figure out what is real what you really

858.72 --> 862.9590000000001
did how your emotions got

861.199 --> 865.5999999999999
pulled in

862.959 --> 865.5999999999999
deal with it

866.32 --> 869.519
and then

867.6 --> 871.76
figure out what is the better course of

869.519 --> 874.16
action and focus on that

871.76 --> 876.72
all right correct yourself

874.16 --> 879.6
stay tuned stay tuned in

876.72 --> 879.6
just let them weep

881.76 --> 885.16
hey orochimaru

885.199 --> 888.16
dusty writer

891.76 --> 896.36
no no you don't good servant

898.079 --> 904.16
but hopefully you do have the leverage

901.92 --> 904.16
to

904.72 --> 908.24
to basically

906.16 --> 910.8
help tom

908.24 --> 913.36
overcome his mistake because that is

910.8 --> 916.56
what he did and everybody knows it

913.36 --> 916.5600000000001
you should know that too

918.88 --> 925.72
i mean

920.88 --> 925.72
priestly conditioning is not an excuse

937.36 --> 942.88

939.759 --> 944.639

942.88 --> 946.24
that's my point that's the point i'm

944.639 --> 949.12

shouldn't you know i mean

1018.48 --> 1022.6

character [ __ ] are you doing that

1050.88 --> 1053.8400000000001
don't

1058.08 --> 1061.36
hey stallion8012

1062.96 --> 1067.28
just a friendly question no no it's not

1065.36 --> 1071.28
a friendly question

1067.28 --> 1074.16
it's data gathering it's inquiry

1071.28 --> 1078.84
andrew hello yeah now a rochimaru is not

1074.16 --> 1080.799
a troll or well i he's an identified

1078.84 --> 1083.9189999999999
troll

1080.799 --> 1083.9189999999999
it's not some sock

1086.64 --> 1092.6000000000001
wow am i paranoid no i just recognize

1089.44 --> 1092.6000000000001
the behavior

1094.48 --> 1099.2
i mean do you disagree

1097.039 --> 1102.16
that it is basically data gathering that

1099.2 --> 1102.16
you engaged in

1106.799 --> 1110.8799999999999
and shouldn't you already know this

1115.32 --> 1120.2
dehumanizing you i didn't do that

1140.24 --> 1145.44
a troll human

1142.64 --> 1148.64
well you have troll traits i've

1145.44 --> 1151.52
seen you act like that before

1148.64 --> 1153.679
so that's that's why

1151.52 --> 1156.32
i'm not saying you're just still human

1153.679 --> 1160.24
it's just that you are not like a

1156.32 --> 1164.76
random sock hiding troll like this guy

1160.24 --> 1164.76
because i just immediately banned them

1173.6 --> 1179.76
i don't even know who that supposedly is

1176.72 --> 1182.24
but i know that i don't allow

1179.76 --> 1184.96
like sock titles like that

1182.24 --> 1184.96
in my chat

1186.799 --> 1191.12
even more when i don't know who they are

1188.96 --> 1191.1200000000001
so

1191.76 --> 1195.919
oh wait tony moran is like a

1193.919 --> 1197.76
character in a movie or an actor or

1195.919 --> 1200.76
something right

1197.76 --> 1200.76
whatever

1211.52 --> 1217.96
oh really clutch bear

1214.4 --> 1217.96
where would you go

1240.08 --> 1243.799
what do you mean clutchberry

1250.88 --> 1254.64
like that's

1252.159 --> 1256.3200000000002
i i feel like you're making a slight

1254.64 --> 1259.039
mistake but i don't know your exact

1256.32 --> 1259.039
situation

1259.28 --> 1265.6
can do it well make them fire you again

1262.559 --> 1269.039
right i try to hand out that tip don't

1265.6 --> 1272.7199999999998
resign make them fire you over that

1269.039 --> 1272.72
illegal thing right

1273.44 --> 1278.64
don't just

1274.559 --> 1280.8799999999999
go don't be scared away

1278.64 --> 1282.159
because of their measures don't don't

1280.88 --> 1284.4
fear it

1282.159 --> 1286.96
let them fire you

1284.4 --> 1289.96
then you got an officially registered

1286.96 --> 1289.96
situation

1291.039 --> 1295.679
and when the [ __ ]

1293.44 --> 1300.44
finally ends

1295.679 --> 1300.44
then you got an anchor point

1309.76 --> 1315.4
maybe just go to alberta okay good point

1320.08 --> 1323.6789999999999
well i i

1322.4 --> 1326.96
i mean

1323.679 --> 1328.0
when i say don't just flee it's good to

1326.96 --> 1331.3600000000001
have a

1328.0 --> 1333.52
a better place in mind where you

1331.36 --> 1336.32
feel or know

1333.52 --> 1337.9189999999999
you will not be confronted with the same

1336.32 --> 1339.6789999999999
levels

1337.919 --> 1342.48
so you don't have to go through it again

1339.679 --> 1345.44
but just don't by default run away from

1342.48 --> 1347.44
where you're at what your job is

1345.44 --> 1349.44
make them fire you

1347.44 --> 1351.8400000000001
don't don't just quit

1349.44 --> 1354.4
that's what they want that's that's easy

1351.84 --> 1356.24
for them you see

1354.4 --> 1359.799
because then you have no legal grounds

1356.24 --> 1359.799
you just quit

1361.52 --> 1364.96
but it is good to

1363.12 --> 1368.2399999999998
if you know that that is going to

1364.96 --> 1369.919
eventually happen still

1368.24 --> 1373.44
find better grounds

1369.919 --> 1375.039
indeed but don't just immediately flee

1373.44 --> 1377.28
there

1375.039 --> 1379.2
first make them fire you

1377.28 --> 1382.3999999999999
you might be surprised that they'll just

1379.2 --> 1384.799
let you stay without a v and without a

1382.4 --> 1384.799
mask

1386.0 --> 1390.679
you never really know until it happens

1406.04 --> 1409.2
[Music]

1428.799 --> 1432.6399999999999
why don't should just go to australia

1440.88 --> 1447.5590000000002
yeah i wouldn't i would put that thought

1443.679 --> 1447.5590000000002
on hold for a while

1477.919 --> 1484.6000000000001
good servant can you please try to

1480.0 --> 1484.6
formulate more coherent sentences

1495.039 --> 1500.12
i i i can't make out what you're saying

1513.84 --> 1518.72
hey banjo bear

1516.24 --> 1518.72
hello

1521.039 --> 1527.4
making jam ah cool

1524.4 --> 1527.4
nice

1533.6 --> 1536.6
hmm

1551.2 --> 1557.72
you don't want to say the names of

1552.96 --> 1557.72
countries why is that good servant

1564.0 --> 1566.72
switzerland

1567.12 --> 1570.12
well

1571.919 --> 1575.5200000000002
that

1573.279 --> 1577.84
definitely would seem like a good idea

1575.52 --> 1578.6399999999999
but it's not easy

1577.84 --> 1580.799
right

1578.64 --> 1583.2
they don't take no [ __ ]

1580.799 --> 1586.6399999999999
from outsiders they're not very eager to

1583.2 --> 1589.44
just have a whole bunch of people

1586.64 --> 1592.4
becoming part of their country the

1589.44 --> 1594.0
bright death take that very serious on

1592.4 --> 1596.48
average

1594.0 --> 1598.24
they have liberals too but

1596.48 --> 1599.76
the on average like they still have a

1598.24 --> 1602.24
strong base

1599.76 --> 1603.44
it's not easy becoming a swiss swiss

1602.24 --> 1605.84
citizen

1603.44 --> 1605.8400000000001
all right

1611.12 --> 1616.3999999999999
and you really gotta learn the language

1614.32 --> 1617.279
or you'll never really be respected

1616.4 --> 1618.96
there

1617.279 --> 1621.52
they'll just keep seeing you as an

1618.96 --> 1621.52
outsider

1623.76 --> 1628.72
so yeah

1625.6 --> 1630.9599999999998
if you really want to aim for swiss

1628.72 --> 1633.3600000000001
you gotta have a really well developed

1630.96 --> 1637.72
plan and you gotta know

1633.36 --> 1637.7199999999998
the their german language

1678.08 --> 1686.0
yeah yeah but you see good servant

1681.36 --> 1687.1999999999998
that's exactly what they don't want

1686.0 --> 1690.159
see

1687.2 --> 1690.159
don't you get it

1690.24 --> 1695.2
that's what they don't want

1692.64 --> 1699.6000000000001
they don't want to have other groups

1695.2 --> 1699.6000000000001
forming their own little societies there

1702.559 --> 1708.44
that

1704.0 --> 1708.44
stick together instead of adapting

1725.2 --> 1729.039
german french italian

1727.36 --> 1732.36
yeah

1729.039 --> 1732.36
it's complicated

1751.52 --> 1754.84
all right anyway

1788.88 --> 1791.88
hmm

1794.0 --> 1797.919
okay stalin 8012 that's

1799.039 --> 1804.12

like which nathan

1837.279 --> 1842.96

1842.96 --> 1847.919
uh yeah but yeah i know like four other

1845.52 --> 1849.6
nathan's okay he is

1847.919 --> 1851.5200000000002

[Applause]

1903.039 --> 1907.84

1912.559 --> 1915.039

1918.72 --> 1922.88
okay but yeah apparently nathan is doing

1921.2 --> 1926.919
that right now so

1922.88 --> 1926.919
i'll just link it up

1956.64 --> 1961.24
worried about the [ __ ] oh come on down

1966.88 --> 1970.64
look

1967.76 --> 1972.559
clutch bear if you really

1970.64 --> 1974.7990000000002
really think

1972.559 --> 1978.559
it's gonna come to that okay

1974.799 --> 1980.72
camps really for the unvacs like

1978.559 --> 1983.12
literally and with

1980.72 --> 1985.919
full world war ii

1983.12 --> 1988.4799999999998
drama movie style rollout right if that

1985.919 --> 1989.279
is really what you're afraid of

1988.48 --> 1991.84
well

1989.279 --> 1994.96
shouldn't you rather be afraid of

1991.84 --> 1997.4399999999998
getting killed in combat instead

1994.96 --> 2000.24
right are you really just gonna let that

1997.44 --> 2000.24
all roll out

2000.32 --> 2005.6789999999999
and you think everybody is just gonna

2003.2 --> 2009.519
let it happen and be all oh i don't

2005.679 --> 2011.519
wanna go no they're gonna say [ __ ] you

2009.519 --> 2014.799
we're gonna kill you

2011.519 --> 2017.1200000000001
and put you on spikes beside the road

2014.799 --> 2019.679
you [ __ ] scumbag

2017.12 --> 2021.9189999999999
satanic bastards

2019.679 --> 2024.96
how the [ __ ] dare you

2021.919 --> 2027.039
our forefathers

2024.96 --> 2028.32
were like

2027.039 --> 2031.679
the most

2028.32 --> 2034.559
the most revered soldiers of their time

2031.679 --> 2037.1200000000001
okay you think you can [ __ ] just

2034.559 --> 2040.08
hoard us to the camps

2037.12 --> 2042.32
like that no [ __ ] way no if that

2040.08 --> 2044.96
really happens and it's not just all

2042.32 --> 2047.12
bluff and you're actually squirting now

2044.96 --> 2048.96
you should be more afraid of actually

2047.12 --> 2051.52
dying in combat because that is what

2048.96 --> 2051.52
would happen

2054.879 --> 2059.7999999999997
it happened other oh really were you

2056.8 --> 2059.8
there

2060.24 --> 2065.839
or did you see it through media clutch

2063.599 --> 2065.839
bear

2068.72 --> 2073.52
how do you know that

2070.72 --> 2075.6789999999996
if people seemingly seem to be sent to

2073.52 --> 2078.48
camps or weather how do you even know

2075.679 --> 2080.2400000000002
that's actually being filmed right then

2078.48 --> 2082.48
and how do you know it's not just

2080.24 --> 2084.24
another situation with a completely

2082.48 --> 2086.96
different setup

2084.24 --> 2088.399
and they're just saying

2086.96 --> 2090.8
it is this

2088.399 --> 2092.3199999999997
for that reason and you buy it very

2090.8 --> 2095.04
easily

2092.32 --> 2095.04
how do you know

2095.359 --> 2100.24
yeah that's right return to normal camps

2097.359 --> 2103.839
are for the v's

2100.24 --> 2103.839
and they'll beg for it

2125.44 --> 2129.76
okay well clutch bear no

2127.44 --> 2132.4
you're saying i'm not realistic no i do

2129.76 --> 2134.8
realize the pressure of that it's just

2132.4 --> 2136.48
that there's two options you can have

2134.8 --> 2139.04
two ends

2136.48 --> 2140.079
to which this can lead in one you're

2139.04 --> 2141.52
weak

2140.079 --> 2143.3590000000004
you're broken

2141.52 --> 2145.68
and you will just be

2143.359 --> 2147.5989999999997
herded to your death and

2145.68 --> 2149.52
there would seemingly be nothing you can

2147.599 --> 2151.92
do about it in the other

2149.52 --> 2152.88
you actually just say enough of this

2151.92 --> 2153.839
[ __ ]

2152.88 --> 2157.119
they're

2153.839 --> 2158.96
the ones no not me not my family they

2157.119 --> 2160.079
are the ones that are gonna [ __ ] die

2158.96 --> 2162.32
now

2160.079 --> 2162.32
right

2162.72 --> 2168.52
you gotta choose you're gonna choose in

2164.88 --> 2168.52
your spirit too

2192.4 --> 2197.6800000000003
i know it's tough man especially

2195.28 --> 2200.48
i can't literally imagine but i i can't

2197.68 --> 2202.72
imagine it must be very scary

2200.48 --> 2202.72
like

2202.8 --> 2206.6400000000003
the hunger to try and protect your

2204.56 --> 2208.7999999999997
family from all this [ __ ]

2206.64 --> 2208.7999999999997
but

2212.56 --> 2216.7999999999997
just

2213.68 --> 2219.52
holding strong in a weak position is not

2216.8 --> 2219.52
the solution

2220.0 --> 2224.28
you got to find the strong position

2257.2 --> 2259.4399999999996
oh

2258.32 --> 2262.7200000000003
okay

2259.44 --> 2262.7200000000003
in dutch sailor yeah

2264.16 --> 2271.64
work calls good luck

2267.359 --> 2271.64
don't forget to lock your bike

2291.04 --> 2296.56
all right clutch but dude i'm sorry if

2294.0 --> 2300.64
what i said if i have seemed

2296.56 --> 2300.64
hard on you man i know it's i

2305.28 --> 2312.1600000000003
it's just that it worries me sometimes

2307.92 --> 2316.16
when i see people like really spiraling

2312.16 --> 2316.16
towards such a conclusion

2316.72 --> 2323.5989999999997
because it just reeks of fear

2320.4 --> 2325.359
and i just want you to realize that

2323.599 --> 2328.48
you gotta find a strong position don't

2325.359 --> 2329.5989999999997
don't dwell

2328.48 --> 2332.079
like that

2329.599 --> 2332.079
that's all

2337.599 --> 2342.48
that's right return to normal that's

2339.119 --> 2342.48
exactly how it works

2345.119 --> 2349.599
you know what is sort of funny maybe a

2347.76 --> 2353.0400000000004
little creepy

2349.599 --> 2355.28
but yeah fear mechanics and fair spells

2353.04 --> 2358.96
yeah

2355.28 --> 2362.0
guess guess what i did in dnd

2358.96 --> 2365.04
i've refined the mechanics of fear

2362.0 --> 2368.28
spells and the layers of fear and how

2365.04 --> 2368.2799999999997
that works

2368.32 --> 2372.48
you look into the

2370.24 --> 2374.4799999999996
new spells

2372.48 --> 2376.32
section

2374.48 --> 2379.44
of my trolls and tyrants you'll find

2376.32 --> 2379.44
that there's a lot of

2379.52 --> 2383.7599999999998
well

2380.64 --> 2385.2799999999997
or no it's the rule changes actually

2383.76 --> 2388.32
it's not something you would typically

2385.28 --> 2390.32
stumble across but i i like made a very

2388.32 --> 2391.839
specific mechanic

2390.32 --> 2396.0
for it so

2391.839 --> 2397.92
to me that's just what's happening right

2396.0 --> 2400.48
there's just layers of fear and then

2397.92 --> 2403.6800000000003
more layers of fear and those that some

2400.48 --> 2405.92
will resist some will find the will

2403.68 --> 2407.839
to save against it others might be

2405.92 --> 2410.2400000000002
completely impervious through magic

2407.839 --> 2412.56
resistance

2410.24 --> 2414.319
but those that fall for it they attain

2412.56 --> 2416.0
new levels

2414.319 --> 2417.599
of the spell effect

2416.0 --> 2420.24
and then there is a limited time

2417.599 --> 2423.44
duration for the spell before it wears

2420.24 --> 2425.839
off depending on the power of it the

2423.44 --> 2428.319
level of the spell the fear spell in

2425.839 --> 2428.319
this case

2429.44 --> 2433.2000000000003
and then it has to be repeated otherwise

2431.92 --> 2435.92
you don't

2433.2 --> 2439.359
stay in that fear level and if it

2435.92 --> 2442.8
compounds high enough then you literally

2439.359 --> 2442.7999999999997
can have a heart attack and die

2442.96 --> 2445.92
yeah

2444.079 --> 2448.8
from pure panic

2445.92 --> 2452.96
to instantaneous terror right

2448.8 --> 2455.76
fear mechanics fear spells i i did some

2452.96 --> 2456.8
redesigning with that [ __ ] to basically

2455.76 --> 2461.4
make it

2456.8 --> 2461.4
more refined more well-defined

2468.8 --> 2472.319
right

2469.68 --> 2472.319
look it up

2472.4 --> 2476.04
trolls the tyres

2487.92 --> 2491.2400000000002
let's see

2496.48 --> 2500.8
where is it

2497.68 --> 2500.7999999999997
detail changes

2503.44 --> 2506.839
where is it

2512.4 --> 2518.52
oh yeah stacking states of fear

2514.88 --> 2518.52
page eight

2525.52 --> 2529.119
yeah

2526.64 --> 2533.1189999999997
i made that

2529.119 --> 2536.119
because i'm a wizard i'm a wizard

2533.119 --> 2536.119
uh

2537.28 --> 2540.8
see if i can show some of this

2546.56 --> 2549.56
okay

2552.24 --> 2556.64
well that's

2553.52 --> 2556.64
way too big

2558.319 --> 2561.52
all right so there you go

2562.319 --> 2567.2799999999997
stacking states of fear

2565.52 --> 2569.28
basically take a look at this little

2567.28 --> 2570.96
list over there

2569.28 --> 2574.1600000000003
that's it

2570.96 --> 2577.04
fear points one two three four five

2574.16 --> 2580.0789999999997
shaken frightened panicked cowering

2577.04 --> 2582.96
nightmare delirium

2580.079 --> 2586.96
and the sixth step

2582.96 --> 2586.96
which is not a state it's just death

2587.359 --> 2593.839
and then there's all the specific

2589.599 --> 2593.839
related mechanical conditions

2595.2 --> 2598.56
so yeah

2596.56 --> 2601.2
maybe you're interested maybe you don't

2598.56 --> 2601.2
give a [ __ ]

2604.48 --> 2611.4
page 8

2606.48 --> 2611.4
of rule changes at trolls and tyrants

2620.96 --> 2624.16
i'll give you the link right

2632.839 --> 2636.96
here [ __ ] your pants come before

2635.359 --> 2638.88
that well i didn't literally make

2636.96 --> 2640.48
mention of that but that's not hard to

2638.88 --> 2642.2400000000002
imagine

2640.48 --> 2644.4
that that could be part of the process

2642.24 --> 2646.9599999999996
it depends on

2644.4 --> 2650.319
if you're a creature type that poos or

2646.96 --> 2652.56
not yeah the ind it can get really weird

2650.319 --> 2655.2
it's not just that

2652.56 --> 2657.359
the fear mechanics are not just

2655.2 --> 2660.0789999999997
humanoid only

2657.359 --> 2662.0
there's more than humans that can

2660.079 --> 2665.04
experience fear like even like

2662.0 --> 2666.72
aberration type cr creatures can

2665.04 --> 2669.52
experience fear there are some that are

2666.72 --> 2673.1189999999997
completely immune to it though

2669.52 --> 2674.88
like undead are default immune

2673.119 --> 2675.84
to fear

2674.88 --> 2677.2000000000003
they don't have the

2675.84 --> 2679.76
[Music]

2677.2 --> 2682.72
the soul

2679.76 --> 2682.7200000000003
to receive it

2686.079 --> 2688.48
anyway

2688.8 --> 2693.5600000000004

it's always green tea

2795.92 --> 2803.2400000000002
unless it's really really hot and then i

2798.4 --> 2803.2400000000002
usually just did water or something

2850.72 --> 2853.72
so

2872.64 --> 2874.8799999999997
huh

2876.96 --> 2880.079
who's beckby

2898.72 --> 2902.319
understanding and forgiveness what

2906.64 --> 2910.5989999999997
it does okay

2931.68 --> 2935.5989999999997
you mad what who mad

2940.839 --> 2945.92
oh drain spot all right yeah

2946.16 --> 2950.96
i know that's a very popularly

2948.0 --> 2950.96
referenced movie

2952.8 --> 2958.88
i i don't know it didn't really do it

2956.64 --> 2960.4
for me

2958.88 --> 2962.2400000000002
too much

2960.4 --> 2965.2400000000002
it's been a long time since i even seen

2962.24 --> 2965.24
that

2970.0 --> 2974.839
but it's like extremely british right

2991.839 --> 2994.839
what

3022.079 --> 3027.6800000000003
oh scottish

3024.64 --> 3029.68
right so here here you go see like

3027.68 --> 3031.839
i'm not from england

3029.68 --> 3034.0789999999997
so in my memory

3031.839 --> 3036.64
like when it kind of fades away it can

3034.079 --> 3039.28
be like yeah i it could be irish or

3036.64 --> 3041.04
scottish or english i'll typically just

3039.28 --> 3043.6800000000003
call it english i know that's very

3041.04 --> 3043.68
insulting

3045.04 --> 3049.2
when it's wrong i'm sorry for that

3049.44 --> 3054.559
then again if i'd had watched the movie

3052.48 --> 3056.2400000000002
pretty recently then i would have had it

3054.559 --> 3060.88
fresh in my memory like yeah it is

3056.24 --> 3060.8799999999997
scottish right so please excuse my

3062.24 --> 3065.24
misnomer

3075.92 --> 3078.7200000000003

3108.8 --> 3113.599
really like how dare you

3111.359 --> 3117.96
we're not english we're like on the

3113.599 --> 3117.96
other side of that fence dammit

3146.16 --> 3148.5589999999997
about

3151.68 --> 3156.8799999999997
good servant i am really trying to

3153.839 --> 3159.7599999999998
figure out what you're saying but

3156.88 --> 3161.92
i just can't figure it out does anybody

3159.76 --> 3164.88
understand what good servant is actually

3161.92 --> 3167.839
talking about in the last 15 minutes

3164.88 --> 3167.839
i have no idea

3183.2 --> 3187.68
oh you're or are you just talking to

3186.16 --> 3191.64
amanda young

3187.68 --> 3191.64
let me figure that out

3193.74 --> 3198.5589999999997
[Music]

3196.319 --> 3198.5589999999997
no

3203.119 --> 3210.319
okay aries stop it or you're gonna get a

3205.76 --> 3210.3190000000004
timeout stop nagging return to normal

3213.52 --> 3218.88
and you're projecting

3216.48 --> 3220.319
you're literally straw manning him

3218.88 --> 3223.359
you're you're

3220.319 --> 3225.52
trying to suggest he's done something

3223.359 --> 3226.88
when he's actually

3225.52 --> 3230.0
on screen

3226.88 --> 3233.8
did the opposite you're strawmanning him

3230.0 --> 3233.8
okay stop it

3236.4 --> 3239.92
okay you're gonna get a timeout now this

3238.319 --> 3242.0
is

3239.92 --> 3244.2400000000002
i don't know what the hell is up with

3242.0 --> 3244.24
that

3244.8 --> 3250.6800000000003
but yeah

3246.8 --> 3250.6800000000003
you're just being nutty

3264.58 --> 3267.739
[Music]

3274.0 --> 3279.359
yeah it seems like maybe your name is

3276.64 --> 3281.839
getting a little to you

3279.359 --> 3284.88
being named after the god of war and it

3281.839 --> 3286.72
seems like you're creating a little war

3284.88 --> 3289.6800000000003
and being

3286.72 --> 3292.72
a curse of a man here in chat

3289.68 --> 3295.5989999999997
by doing that so

3292.72 --> 3295.5989999999997
yeah stop it

3299.92 --> 3305.2000000000003
right and this is better to why you

3302.4 --> 3309.359
should just name your account after your

3305.2 --> 3309.359
actual identity just don't be afraid

3309.52 --> 3317.7599999999998
to be identified to actually

3312.799 --> 3317.7599999999998
take responsibility for who you

3318.839 --> 3324.16
are and represent

3322.24 --> 3326.3999999999996
right

3324.16 --> 3329.92
because when you start to like get weird

3326.4 --> 3333.88
titles and [ __ ] behavior becomes erratic

3329.92 --> 3333.88
it happens every time

3338.88 --> 3342.079
hmm

3340.079 --> 3343.44
right fiji krishek well you just copy

3342.079 --> 3346.6400000000003
paste the title

3343.44 --> 3346.64
just copy paste it

3347.04 --> 3353.2
i mean that that's doable right on a

3349.44 --> 3353.2000000000003
mobile or is that really difficult

3360.64 --> 3364.8799999999997
no no return to normal but look your

3363.44 --> 3366.96
name

3364.88 --> 3369.52
is not freaky

3366.96 --> 3372.16
right just saying return to normal

3369.52 --> 3373.119
that's a good thing to say

3372.16 --> 3375.1189999999997
right

3373.119 --> 3376.88
what can be wrong about returning to

3375.119 --> 3381.52
normal

3376.88 --> 3381.52
so that's not gonna be a bad influence

3382.559 --> 3388.96
i'm not saying you can never

3384.72 --> 3392.0789999999997
you must have your name as your title no

3388.96 --> 3395.2
no no no but if you're gonna be like

3392.079 --> 3398.319
i am the ultimate

3395.2 --> 3400.96
god of evil squirt boy yeah guess what's

3398.319 --> 3403.2
gonna happen this you're gonna turn into

3400.96 --> 3405.04
that

3403.2 --> 3407.839
because you're hiding under some virtual

3405.04 --> 3410.96
power and that yeah that

3407.839 --> 3412.799
pulls you away from who you really are

3410.96 --> 3417.16
if you just have a name like return to

3412.799 --> 3417.16
normal what could be wrong with that

3428.799 --> 3433.839
did research flat earth get banned you

3431.599 --> 3433.839
mean

3435.599 --> 3441.1600000000003
like a strike or something i don't know

3437.92 --> 3441.16
did he

3445.02 --> 3448.11
[Music]

3456.88 --> 3460.76
doesn't look like it

3462.96 --> 3467.319
i mean the channel's still up

3500.4 --> 3505.319
yeah clutch bear that's all fine

3533.359 --> 3536.5589999999997
all right see you later again

3536.88 --> 3539.2000000000003
all right

3542.319 --> 3544.799
hey

3543.2 --> 3548.319
looks like

3544.799 --> 3551.28
the sun is coming through after all nice

3548.319 --> 3553.7599999999998
i guess it really was just temporary

3551.28 --> 3556.3190000000004
look at that

3553.76 --> 3559.3190000000004
how quickly it changes around it's just

3556.319 --> 3559.319
incredible

3563.2 --> 3567.3999999999996
big clouds out there though

3591.839 --> 3597.0789999999997
hey one for the unit good to see you

3657.52 --> 3660.52
stream

3666.61 --> 3669.809
[Applause]

3685.119 --> 3689.2000000000003
hey steamy traveler what's happening uh

3687.52 --> 3690.4
well nothing really special at the

3689.2 --> 3692.64
moment

3690.4 --> 3695.52
nathan had there's apparently like a

3692.64 --> 3697.5989999999997
weird chemical fire

3695.52 --> 3699.52
not too far away from him and from

3697.599 --> 3702.319
nathan oakley he filmed that he did a

3699.52 --> 3704.64
little stream about it

3702.319 --> 3708.92
i think this flat earth debates is still

3704.64 --> 3708.92
going to be on schedule so

3720.48 --> 3726.68
it's all right one footer unit is a

3722.4 --> 3726.6800000000003
measure of feed oh interesting

3734.96 --> 3739.359
that's yeah that makes sense

3737.28 --> 3742.3190000000004
because i knew the fred the saying

3739.359 --> 3744.96
cannon faller very harsh but that makes

3742.319 --> 3747.44
sense because that would mean

3744.96 --> 3748.96
food for the cannons

3747.44 --> 3750.079
so that's

3748.96 --> 3752.88
ah

3750.079 --> 3754.48
just learn something

3752.88 --> 3757.119
fodder is

3754.48 --> 3759.359
basically feed

3757.119 --> 3759.359
hmm

3764.799 --> 3769.599
oh an edge on the flat plane right well

3767.599 --> 3772.48
how a bad karma

3769.599 --> 3773.92
welcome to my chat hey concerning that

3772.48 --> 3775.76
edge right

3773.92 --> 3780.16
that you like to

3775.76 --> 3784.1600000000003
talk about how about that sphere edge

3780.16 --> 3785.92
the edge of the sphere earth

3784.16 --> 3788.48
when you look at it

3785.92 --> 3791.76
where things start to disappear behind

3788.48 --> 3794.319
its geometry how about that

3791.76 --> 3796.48
sphere edge

3794.319 --> 3798.799
that is provably

3796.48 --> 3802.559
there that has to be there it's it would

3798.799 --> 3805.68
be natural result of viewing it

3802.559 --> 3805.6800000000003
how about that edge

3808.0 --> 3812.799
right not some straw man assumption of

3811.28 --> 3814.96
where the

3812.799 --> 3816.799
flat plane of which we don't fully

3814.96 --> 3818.319
understand the orientation and the

3816.799 --> 3819.92
confines

3818.319 --> 3822.4
how that is supposed to have some kind

3819.92 --> 3825.119
of an edge somewhere

3822.4 --> 3828.2400000000002
yeah thank thanks the flatter society

3825.119 --> 3830.799
for that straw man conception

3828.24 --> 3832.5589999999997
since what is it the 80s

3830.799 --> 3835.0389999999998
you can thank them for it or the 90s

3832.559 --> 3835.039
whatever

3835.599 --> 3841.6800000000003
but how about that sphere edge

3839.44 --> 3844.48
you know a sphere when you look at it

3841.68 --> 3847.359
where the geometry of it starts to

3844.48 --> 3850.2400000000002
conceal things from view

3847.359 --> 3852.88
behind it how about that edge

3850.24 --> 3855.68
of the sphere earth that you think

3852.88 --> 3855.6800000000003
you're standing on

3864.559 --> 3870.2400000000002
has anybody tried to locate the edge of

3866.96 --> 3870.2400000000002
sure i'm sure they have

3871.839 --> 3876.72
but to even assume that there is some

3874.0 --> 3877.76
kind of an edge is

3876.72 --> 3880.0
weird

3877.76 --> 3882.2400000000002
especially if you assume you can fall

3880.0 --> 3884.72
off it right that is

3882.24 --> 3886.8799999999997
very odd fantasy

3884.72 --> 3889.52
to assume that there is going to be an

3886.88 --> 3892.88
end of the surface and after that you

3889.52 --> 3896.0
fall off that's really the edge

3892.88 --> 3898.7200000000003
you like to talk about

3896.0 --> 3901.359
from the anti-flat earth perspective

3898.72 --> 3903.52
the straw man us with

3901.359 --> 3906.5589999999997
thanks to the flatter society

3903.52 --> 3910.72
introducing that conception as as an

3906.559 --> 3910.7200000000003
actual argument supposedly

3911.2 --> 3916.0789999999997
you can thank them for it right

3913.76 --> 3919.119
nobody among naturally

3916.079 --> 3921.119
concluded flat earthers claims there is

3919.119 --> 3924.2400000000002
an edge

3921.119 --> 3926.2400000000002
right some might claim a dome

3924.24 --> 3928.16
right

3926.24 --> 3930.24
that could be considered an edge right

3928.16 --> 3932.8799999999997
where a dome touches down with a flat

3930.24 --> 3934.3999999999996
surface that's kind of an edge

3932.88 --> 3935.599
sorta

3934.4 --> 3938.64
right

3935.599 --> 3942.96
but not not that edge where you fall off

3938.64 --> 3945.52
there's literally no flat earther

3942.96 --> 3948.2400000000002
that's researched the mechanics of this

3945.52 --> 3953.359
realm there's zero flat earthers that

3948.24 --> 3953.359
believe that zero zero zero

3956.799 --> 3962.079
what is the real shape

3960.0 --> 3964.4
well we don't know

3962.079 --> 3966.4
the to suggest there is a shape you're

3964.4 --> 3969.92
almost automatically

3966.4 --> 3972.0
suggesting a spherically oriented

3969.92 --> 3974.16
geometry

3972.0 --> 3976.64
right when you say shape

3974.16 --> 3978.72
well when you learn about shapes what is

3976.64 --> 3979.5989999999997
the most predominant thing about it

3978.72 --> 3981.7599999999998
right

3979.599 --> 3983.76
well when you learn about 2d shapes well

3981.76 --> 3986.559
they're all flat right those are shapes

3983.76 --> 3988.559
too and when you learn about 3d shapes

3986.559 --> 3989.3590000000004
well every time we get to learn about

3988.559 --> 3991.119
them

3989.359 --> 3994.24
they're always

3991.119 --> 3996.079
circle centric in some way

3994.24 --> 3997.68
right unless it's like a completely

3996.079 --> 4000.0
irregular

3997.68 --> 4002.0789999999997
totally asymmetrical shape

4000.0 --> 4005.68
but that's usually not what people have

4002.079 --> 4008.319
in mind when they think of the earth

4005.68 --> 4009.9199999999996
right it could be literally roasted

4008.319 --> 4011.92
chicken shaped

4009.92 --> 4014.319
if it was that irregular

4011.92 --> 4016.319
but the problem is every time there is a

4014.319 --> 4019.44
shape and a geometry

4016.319 --> 4021.119
shape 3d shape

4019.44 --> 4024.88
geometrically there's going to be

4021.119 --> 4028.48
geometrical consequences there will be

4024.88 --> 4031.6800000000003
edges of that shape that conceal

4028.48 --> 4036.799
optically to those who view conceal

4031.68 --> 4036.799
parts behind it at a persistent rate

4037.44 --> 4043.039
depending on its exact geometric

4041.839 --> 4045.2799999999997
arc

4043.039 --> 4048.079
in that specific spot of the irregular

4045.28 --> 4050.6400000000003
geometry right

4048.079 --> 4052.079
so shape what shape no we don't know a

4050.64 --> 4055.1189999999997
shape

4052.079 --> 4059.039
we don't suggest the shape

4055.119 --> 4062.799
what we know is the surface orientation

4059.039 --> 4064.1600000000003
right we know a geometric aspect

4062.799 --> 4068.16
of this realm

4064.16 --> 4070.3999999999996
and that geometric aspect is flat

4068.16 --> 4072.96
it's not a it's not a shape flat is not

4070.4 --> 4074.96
its shape but it the earth is flat

4072.96 --> 4077.52
though

4074.96 --> 4079.92
surface orientation

4077.52 --> 4082.64
is flat

4079.92 --> 4082.64
flat plain

4085.92 --> 4089.76
yeah steamy traveler yeah roasted

4087.599 --> 4092.319
chicken shaped is not

4089.76 --> 4094.7200000000003
new i came up with that with that on the

4092.319 --> 4096.96
flat earth debates or like nathan i

4094.72 --> 4099.5199999999995
think nathan jokingly suggested it and

4096.96 --> 4101.839
then i immediately refi tried to reify

4099.52 --> 4105.719
it into reality

4101.839 --> 4105.719
as i typically do

4106.159 --> 4111.679
right but we were talking about shapes

4108.48 --> 4114.48
flat earth has a boundary

4111.679 --> 4117.04
can you be more specific i mean there is

4114.48 --> 4118.959999999999
containment there is a specific limited

4117.04 --> 4122.0
available volume

4118.96 --> 4125.199
for the gas to fill

4122.0 --> 4125.199
we know that much

4127.12 --> 4132.5599999999995
but we don't know

4128.719 --> 4134.96
what the containment is like right

4132.56 --> 4138.719
one would basically conclude that it

4134.96 --> 4141.04
would have to be some kind of a dome a

4138.719 --> 4142.96
physical container because that is how

4141.04 --> 4144.96
we can emulate

4142.96 --> 4146.4800000000005
even and figure out like the second law

4144.96 --> 4148.64
of thermodynamics here in the realm

4146.48 --> 4150.799
through that conception

4148.64 --> 4152.719
but then again yeah when you look at the

4150.799 --> 4155.2789999999995
freaking stars and you realize it's

4152.719 --> 4158.0
holographic and that we can't physically

4155.279 --> 4161.4400000000005
emulate that at this current time here

4158.0 --> 4164.08
on earth with the devices we have

4161.44 --> 4166.48
then well maybe it's not a containment

4164.08 --> 4169.12
as we can create right i've suggested

4166.48 --> 4172.5599999999995
maybe that space is non-linear

4169.12 --> 4174.4
and a loop is part of the containment

4172.56 --> 4176.159000000001
a loop within

4174.4 --> 4179.44
the space

4176.159 --> 4182.96
volume available might be

4179.44 --> 4185.04
a container wall by basically making it

4182.96 --> 4189.159
no further space for the gas to fill

4185.04 --> 4189.159
it'll just bump into itself

4189.92 --> 4195.76
from both directions right so what is

4192.88 --> 4197.92
the nature of the

4195.76 --> 4199.679
containment

4197.92 --> 4201.84
we don't know

4199.679 --> 4204.56
the most

4201.84 --> 4207.04
logical conclusion to draw based on what

4204.56 --> 4209.280000000001
we know and can emulate here it would be

4207.04 --> 4210.32
a completely physical container of some

4209.28 --> 4211.5199999999995
kind

4210.32 --> 4215.5199999999995
but yeah

4211.52 --> 4216.400000000001
that's assuming it is really all like we

4215.52 --> 4219.679
can

4216.4 --> 4219.679
fabricate ourselves

4220.239 --> 4225.28
and there's already things out there

4221.92 --> 4228.28
that we cannot refabricate ourselves at

4225.28 --> 4228.28
all

4232.88 --> 4236.08
would that not prevent a crash pressure

4234.719 --> 4239.52
graded nope

4236.08 --> 4241.92
absolutely not a pressure gradient

4239.52 --> 4244.8
can be created in any container in any

4241.92 --> 4246.719
container we make you can create a gas

4244.8 --> 4248.96
pressure gradient you know how

4246.719 --> 4250.88
temperature differential

4248.96 --> 4253.36
through the closed system

4250.88 --> 4254.400000000001
contained closed system where the gas is

4253.36 --> 4257.12
in

4254.4 --> 4259.12
you introduce a hot element on one side

4257.12 --> 4260.4
and a cold element on the other no

4259.12 --> 4263.92
matter how

4260.4 --> 4266.48
you orient it right whether you

4263.92 --> 4269.52
do it from side to side from top to

4266.48 --> 4272.08
bottom back forth it doesn't matter

4269.52 --> 4275.120000000001
there will be a gradient between the

4272.08 --> 4278.5599999999995
hottest part and the coldest part within

4275.12 --> 4281.679
the gas that's what happens

4278.56 --> 4283.6
gas forms a gradient if there is

4281.679 --> 4287.84
a temperature

4283.6 --> 4290.88
differential within the containment

4287.84 --> 4292.400000000001
and that's what i think is the setting

4290.88 --> 4295.84
that's what's happening and we can

4292.4 --> 4298.32
already prove there is hot heat hot

4295.84 --> 4300.64
heat hotness

4298.32 --> 4303.44
due to the

4300.64 --> 4304.96
receival of sun energy here on earth and

4303.44 --> 4308.08
even thermal

4304.96 --> 4308.08
from underneath us

4309.679 --> 4317.52
and that certainly is not up there

4313.52 --> 4319.52
there's no heat being received up there

4317.52 --> 4321.280000000001
except for what kind of comes dwelling

4319.52 --> 4324.4800000000005
upward

4321.28 --> 4324.48
and it all cools off

4324.56 --> 4329.76
so yeah one would have to conclude there

4327.12 --> 4331.36
is heat being introduced at ground level

4329.76 --> 4334.64
and there is

4331.36 --> 4336.32
cold or deleting a way of heat at the

4334.64 --> 4337.92
top

4336.32 --> 4341.04
and that is

4337.92 --> 4345.04
the only way i can conceive of that the

4341.04 --> 4345.04
gradient is forming here in this realm

4352.88 --> 4355.88
ah

4357.92 --> 4361.92
don't forget about the oceanic pressure

4359.92 --> 4364.08
gradient yeah yeah but that's actually

4361.92 --> 4366.56
because it's not a gas right it's a

4364.08 --> 4366.5599999999995
liquid

4369.36 --> 4372.88
that's different

4371.12 --> 4374.96
it wouldn't be a liquid by the way if

4372.88 --> 4378.0
the earth was not contained

4374.96 --> 4380.719
because then all the gas would evacuate

4378.0 --> 4382.96
and then all the water would boil and

4380.719 --> 4386.88
evaporate and then also

4382.96 --> 4386.88
[ __ ] off in outer space so

4389.28 --> 4392.719
it's definitely contained

4395.28 --> 4400.88
which direction would hot gas go in all

4398.159 --> 4400.879999999999
directions

4403.36 --> 4408.719
it goes in all directions but if there

4405.679 --> 4412.2390000000005
is an option for it to go down

4408.719 --> 4413.36
then it will prefer

4412.239 --> 4417.44
up

4413.36 --> 4417.44
or basically every direction but down

4417.52 --> 4423.679
because of the nature

4419.92 --> 4428.96
right it's still like hot gas also has

4423.679 --> 4431.52
a tendency to expand more than cold gas

4428.96 --> 4435.36
which would also basically cause it to

4431.52 --> 4437.360000000001
be less dense than coal gas

4435.36 --> 4438.839999999999
it's very complicated how it all works

4437.36 --> 4440.48
though you know this

4438.84 --> 4443.4400000000005
aerodynamics

4440.48 --> 4443.44
meteorology

4448.0 --> 4452.4
but overall hot gas would go up

4451.36 --> 4456.96
just as

4452.4 --> 4459.199
like a naturally cold gas that still gas

4456.96 --> 4460.96
would typically go down first it would

4459.199 --> 4463.759999999999
spread in all directions but it would

4460.96 --> 4463.76
prefer down

4466.159 --> 4471.92
if it has that maneuvering option if it

4469.199 --> 4474.32
can actually go there and suppress what

4471.92 --> 4476.64
other gases are there

4474.32 --> 4476.639999999999
it's

4482.239 --> 4488.639999999999
it would be impossible to locate locate

4485.92 --> 4491.36
the containment

4488.64 --> 4493.679
or an edge no no it would not be

4491.36 --> 4494.839999999999
impossible

4493.679 --> 4497.92
right you

4494.84 --> 4500.96
can't locate

4497.92 --> 4503.36
like a containment a physical barrier if

4500.96 --> 4505.76
there isn't any and it's looping yeah

4503.36 --> 4510.759999999999
then you can't figure that out but you

4505.76 --> 4510.76
can basically measure the loop length

4512.48 --> 4514.718999999999
right

4514.96 --> 4518.64
you can figure out

4517.36 --> 4520.88
how

4518.64 --> 4523.76
long a distance do you have to walk in a

4520.88 --> 4527.28
straight line literally euclidean wise

4523.76 --> 4529.76
before you end up in the exact same spot

4527.28 --> 4533.719
and then you have a length of the entire

4529.76 --> 4533.719
loop within the system

4545.04 --> 4550.32
all right and if there isn't a loop

4548.0 --> 4552.08
like there's not a loop in a certain

4550.32 --> 4554.5599999999995
type of direction because hey no

4552.08 --> 4556.719
guarantees there is a loop

4554.56 --> 4559.120000000001
the north and south

4556.719 --> 4562.4
i'd like to think so because that opens

4559.12 --> 4564.48
up this amazing possibility

4562.4 --> 4565.5199999999995
of more land and not just a little more

4564.48 --> 4569.04
land but

4565.52 --> 4569.040000000001
entire realm sections

4569.44 --> 4572.4
which i don't think can be

4571.12 --> 4575.76
[Music]

4572.4 --> 4575.759999999999
found east or west

4576.0 --> 4580.36
within the looping model

4587.36 --> 4590.799999999999
there no but

4589.199 --> 4592.839999999999
i thought there's no way to actually

4590.8 --> 4596.159000000001
detect where the looping occurs that's

4592.84 --> 4599.76
right you can't detect it but you can

4596.159 --> 4601.04
measure how wide the loop is

4599.76 --> 4604.400000000001
you can

4601.04 --> 4606.4
derive the parameters

4604.4 --> 4608.5599999999995
but yeah loops don't have actual

4606.4 --> 4610.879999999999
positions the entire thing is the loop

4608.56 --> 4615.360000000001
the entire length

4610.88 --> 4615.36
is the loop every part is the loop

4620.0 --> 4623.56
if it is looping

4633.71 --> 4636.76
[Music]

4653.44 --> 4659.0
right anyway you can think about that

4655.12 --> 4659.0
i'll be back in two minutes

4716.239 --> 4719.239
huh

4722.56 --> 4725.56
um

4756.32 --> 4759.88
and i'm back

4762.96 --> 4766.0
welcome back again

4771.6 --> 4776.08
i didn't make it up what did i make up

4774.08 --> 4777.28
what what did he say you retracted that

4776.08 --> 4780.679
message

4777.28 --> 4780.679
pj krishan

4790.08 --> 4797.5199999999995
okay bad karma so you're an a eric

4794.8 --> 4799.52
one one one one

4797.52 --> 4801.92
yeah bad karma

4799.52 --> 4804.8
well if you assume the earth is

4801.92 --> 4807.84
literally a disk

4804.8 --> 4807.84
and not looping

4809.12 --> 4815.12
and it is supposedly all euclidean as is

4812.56 --> 4817.04
then yes you would eventually hit an

4815.12 --> 4818.88
edge

4817.04 --> 4820.08
if you go in a straight line no matter

4818.88 --> 4822.639
where you are

4820.08 --> 4822.639
that's right

4824.08 --> 4831.04
but that's only if you really think the

4826.88 --> 4835.4400000000005
earth is a literal euclidean disk

4831.04 --> 4835.44
and i don't really believe that

4836.88 --> 4843.12
like even if you put the map segments

4840.48 --> 4847.48
together in that type of projection

4843.12 --> 4847.48
you'll still find it's off scale

4849.36 --> 4854.96
there is no two scale

4852.159 --> 4856.879999999999
map maced model it doesn't exist

4854.96 --> 4858.719
currently not the globe

4856.88 --> 4860.8
not the disk

4858.719 --> 4862.08
and

4860.8 --> 4866.56
yeah not

4862.08 --> 4866.5599999999995
the rectangular type map

4867.84 --> 4871.360000000001
it reveals that really no matter what

4869.84 --> 4874.4800000000005
type of projection you have there's

4871.36 --> 4876.5599999999995
always scaling issues it's weird

4874.48 --> 4879.199
right and that kind of leads me to

4876.56 --> 4881.679
believe that space may not be entirely

4879.199 --> 4881.678999999999
linear

4882.159 --> 4886.32
because how could it never beat the

4884.0 --> 4888.4
scale

4886.32 --> 4891.04
if everything is just linear that makes

4888.4 --> 4891.04
no sense

4893.84 --> 4898.32
he said looping earth is another thing i

4896.0 --> 4899.36
made up

4898.32 --> 4901.599999999999
well

4899.36 --> 4903.679
i didn't literally make it up but i do

4901.6 --> 4905.679
champion it

4903.679 --> 4908.4
as part of my

4905.679 --> 4911.36
yeah what i talk about

4908.4 --> 4912.5599999999995
no but i did get originally get the idea

4911.36 --> 4916.239
from

4912.56 --> 4919.280000000001
a square earth cosmology channel

4916.239 --> 4920.799999999999
who was known before as flat

4919.28 --> 4923.84
or yeah

4920.8 --> 4926.4800000000005
free energy with an a then he changed

4923.84 --> 4928.639
his name to square earth cosmology

4926.48 --> 4930.799999999999
he's the first one to basically make a

4928.639 --> 4933.1990000000005
really well looking

4930.8 --> 4935.28
3d model for it

4933.199 --> 4937.5199999999995
that's just astounding

4935.28 --> 4939.36
very impressive for its time

4937.52 --> 4941.52
and i thought like this

4939.36 --> 4944.159
there is something here and

4941.52 --> 4945.6
it's like he didn't even like completely

4944.159 --> 4948.879999999999
address it

4945.6 --> 4951.280000000001
that elaborately he didn't zoom in on

4948.88 --> 4953.36
the looping factor as much

4951.28 --> 4955.36
within his work he was more interested

4953.36 --> 4956.96
in trying to figure out the nature of

4955.36 --> 4958.88
light

4956.96 --> 4961.679
and all that at the time

4958.88 --> 4965.6
and other things

4961.679 --> 4968.159
i was just like uh looping you say

4965.6 --> 4969.52
oh that's gonna that's gonna be a

4968.159 --> 4971.44
swinger

4969.52 --> 4973.679
that's gonna be a zinger

4971.44 --> 4976.799999999999
i'm gonna take i'm gonna figure that out

4973.679 --> 4978.56
i'm gonna like become a theorist about

4976.8 --> 4981.12
that

4978.56 --> 4984.4800000000005
i knew back then when i saw this it's

4981.12 --> 4986.639
like yeah this is so confusing

4984.48 --> 4988.879999999999
it's gonna make so many people

4986.639 --> 4991.12
squirt walk away

4988.88 --> 4993.679
there is some there has to be something

4991.12 --> 4993.679
about this

4993.92 --> 4999.56
it's because so many people just

4995.92 --> 4999.56
rejected it

5001.28 --> 5004.719
they were still latching on to

5002.719 --> 5006.719
physicality assumption bias and all that

5004.719 --> 5009.6
right because that's the nature of human

5006.719 --> 5011.76
beings to do that

5009.6 --> 5014.719
or it is becoming the nature it has

5011.76 --> 5017.04
become the nature through the

5014.719 --> 5020.4
the patterns of the education we've all

5017.04 --> 5020.4
been subjected to for

5020.48 --> 5025.5599999999995
well five six generations more

5030.4 --> 5034.32
a sphere is like kind of a loop no it's

5033.28 --> 5037.599999999999
not

5034.32 --> 5041.44
now a sphere is actually a geometry

5037.6 --> 5044.0
very specific geometrical

5041.44 --> 5044.0
elements

5045.84 --> 5050.96
it's not a loop

5048.239 --> 5053.839999999999
you can think of it as a loop

5050.96 --> 5056.0
relative to you if you assume you're

5053.84 --> 5058.88
walking on it sure but that's called

5056.0 --> 5061.28
circumdecular geometry it's not actually

5058.88 --> 5061.28
a loop

5062.88 --> 5066.679
it's a literal geometry

5079.6 --> 5084.639
do the rest of flatter debate team

5081.36 --> 5086.4
subscribe to the looping system

5084.639 --> 5088.8
not really

5086.4 --> 5092.239
they try to avoid

5088.8 --> 5095.12
making claims and entertaining models

5092.239 --> 5097.12
they try to avoid this really

5095.12 --> 5099.679
and i don't blame them

5097.12 --> 5102.159
but hey i'm a theorist

5099.679 --> 5105.04
theory is what i do

5102.159 --> 5107.12
and so i'm not just because they don't

5105.04 --> 5108.88
like it and they're gonna shave me every

5107.12 --> 5111.28
time he's brought up it's like yeah but

5108.88 --> 5114.8
what about looping and you hear nathan

5111.28 --> 5117.36
oh no not that again and like yeah

5114.8 --> 5120.0
scored for me nathan i don't care i know

5117.36 --> 5122.159
what i'm doing

5120.0 --> 5124.8
pose that obstacle

5122.159 --> 5124.799999999999
i don't care

5125.52 --> 5130.2390000000005
it's fine

5126.719 --> 5132.96
you don't have to be with me

5130.239 --> 5135.44
when i bring it up it's all fine i know

5132.96 --> 5138.4800000000005
what i'm doing i know what i'm saying i

5135.44 --> 5140.32
thought about this very very carefully

5138.48 --> 5145.28
or while thinking about is a difficult

5140.32 --> 5146.5599999999995
word i've dreamed about this elaborately

5145.28 --> 5149.199
yeah

5146.56 --> 5151.04
elaborately

5149.199 --> 5154.0
holographic

5151.04 --> 5156.239
projection simulation in the dream and

5154.0 --> 5156.239
all

5162.08 --> 5167.6
what exactly do i mean by looping and

5164.88 --> 5168.96
what does it do it doesn't do anything

5167.6 --> 5172.0
looping

5168.96 --> 5174.719
realm looping is a

5172.0 --> 5177.84
spatial parameter right this is not

5174.719 --> 5181.12
about things in space it's about space

5177.84 --> 5184.96
itself the volume and the volume how it

5181.12 --> 5186.8
connects to other things to other volume

5184.96 --> 5188.96
that's spatial

5186.8 --> 5191.4400000000005
right when i talk about spatial it's

5188.96 --> 5193.6
volumetrics it's about the volume

5191.44 --> 5194.839999999999
nothing about what is in the volume it's

5193.6 --> 5196.719
pure

5194.84 --> 5198.56
space

5196.719 --> 5200.88
you have to separate that this is not

5198.56 --> 5202.56
about density or anything about that

5200.88 --> 5205.679
anything about what is in the volume

5202.56 --> 5208.96
it's only about the spatial

5205.679 --> 5211.84
division of what exists of the volume

5208.96 --> 5211.84
that is available

5212.8 --> 5217.52
but space is no outer space is fake

5218.719 --> 5224.12
right

5220.96 --> 5227.76
the suggestion that there is an infinite

5224.12 --> 5231.04
euclidean available volume that is the

5227.76 --> 5234.6
idea of outer space that is fake and

5231.04 --> 5234.6
physically impossible

5242.239 --> 5247.36
like there is no possible way that could

5244.48 --> 5247.36
be made to happen

5247.76 --> 5252.8
i don't well

5250.719 --> 5254.96
who am i to say but i don't even think

5252.8 --> 5257.92
that god could

5254.96 --> 5259.84
make nature that defiant to itself in

5257.92 --> 5262.159
order to make that happen it can only

5259.84 --> 5265.400000000001
happen in our imagination which is much

5262.159 --> 5265.4
more flexible

5266.56 --> 5269.679
spatial matter that no

5268.8 --> 5272.159000000001
no

5269.679 --> 5274.08
no matter there's no matter involved agm

5272.159 --> 5275.759999999999
it's only space

5274.08 --> 5278.4
a loop

5275.76 --> 5281.52
a realm loop

5278.4 --> 5284.799999999999
spatial non-linearity has nothing

5281.52 --> 5287.6
whatsoever to do with matter zero no

5284.8 --> 5291.76
matter involved only space

5287.6 --> 5293.6
only the division of the volume

5291.76 --> 5298.12
and how it interconnects with every

5293.6 --> 5298.120000000001
other volume available

5336.0 --> 5340.08
oh my god

5337.52 --> 5340.080000000001
mikey

5340.8 --> 5346.56
i already did all of that i

5343.76 --> 5348.2390000000005
i freaking did them the magnet thing on

5346.56 --> 5351.4400000000005
the body

5348.239 --> 5355.04
twice now two episodes i did that i

5351.44 --> 5360.48
entertained that lunacy right

5355.04 --> 5363.28
mark smiler is a liar a filthy scumbag

5360.48 --> 5365.839999999999
he's a liar he literally promised me

5363.28 --> 5365.84
money

5368.08 --> 5373.04
and i never believed it for a second he

5370.8 --> 5375.679
literally said that [ __ ]

5373.04 --> 5379.28
just do as i say and i'll get you 500

5375.679 --> 5382.159
euros he actually said that that scumbag

5379.28 --> 5387.04
filthy [ __ ] little grabbler piece of

5382.159 --> 5387.04
[ __ ] mark smiler scumbag

5390.48 --> 5396.0
there's only one reason you're here and

5392.48 --> 5396.959999999999
that is to try to derail and defuse what

5396.0 --> 5399.36
i do

5396.96 --> 5404.159
because it burns you because you're a

5399.36 --> 5404.159
filthy scumbag you're a demon

5404.239 --> 5410.159
and you can't handle me

5406.639 --> 5412.56
if you could you just give me that money

5410.159 --> 5414.44
if you could and then that would help me

5412.56 --> 5416.0
greatly

5414.44 --> 5418.48
unconditionally

5416.0 --> 5421.6
yeah but you don't do that no instead

5418.48 --> 5424.32
you try to manipulate me make me do all

5421.6 --> 5427.120000000001
kinds of weird [ __ ] and you were never

5424.32 --> 5428.08
gonna pay me ever

5427.12 --> 5430.159
ever

5428.08 --> 5433.36
i know you weren't because you're a

5430.159 --> 5436.0
filthy scumbag mark smiler

5433.36 --> 5438.4
a liar a demon

5436.0 --> 5442.08
a real one

5438.4 --> 5442.08
you're not in control of yourself

5442.48 --> 5447.44
if you really have that money and you

5444.96 --> 5449.84
really want to help me out you just give

5447.44 --> 5449.839999999999
it to me

5473.84 --> 5480.2390000000005
a valid way of bloofing flat surface no

5476.48 --> 5483.36
no no no no you don't need to find

5480.239 --> 5486.48
a physical edge bad karma

5483.36 --> 5488.639
to validate the surface being flat you

5486.48 --> 5491.5199999999995
can simply disprove

5488.639 --> 5493.76
it has another geometrical aspect to it

5491.52 --> 5497.040000000001
that it's anything but flat

5493.76 --> 5501.1990000000005
right it's called the black swan

5497.04 --> 5502.96
right oh you think it is not flat

5501.199 --> 5504.4
okay well what do you think it is oh you

5502.96 --> 5507.12
think it's a globe

5504.4 --> 5509.599999999999
well guess what black swan it's not a

5507.12 --> 5509.599999999999
globe

5510.719 --> 5516.96
yeah we don't need to find a freaking

5513.44 --> 5519.839999999999
edge to prove it's flat

5516.96 --> 5519.84
it is flat

5520.239 --> 5524.959999999999
black swan observations prove it's not

5524.08 --> 5528.5199999999995
a

5524.96 --> 5528.52
spherical geometry

5545.6 --> 5550.159000000001
isn't the black swan easily explained by

5547.92 --> 5551.36
refraction no it isn't

5550.159 --> 5553.599999999999
you know why

5551.36 --> 5555.44
because if you assume terrestrial

5553.6 --> 5557.679
refraction

5555.44 --> 5562.0
could explain the black swan

5557.679 --> 5563.6
then you no longer have an r value ever

5562.0 --> 5567.04
you know why

5563.6 --> 5568.08
because the r value is based

5567.04 --> 5572.88
on

5568.08 --> 5575.679
figuring out the geometry of earth

5572.88 --> 5578.8
by checking out the horizon

5575.679 --> 5580.96
now if the horizon is displaced because

5578.8 --> 5583.52
of terrestrial refraction

5580.96 --> 5586.96
then you could have never established

5583.52 --> 5587.76
the geometry of what you think is sphere

5586.96 --> 5590.0
earth

5587.76 --> 5591.92
it's a paradox

5590.0 --> 5592.96
and there's nothing you could do about

5591.92 --> 5595.04
it

5592.96 --> 5597.36
you can't reason your way out of it you

5595.04 --> 5601.28
can't work around it it's a paradox it

5597.36 --> 5604.32
shall forever be a paradox because it's

5601.28 --> 5606.96
a mathematical paradox it's a par a

5604.32 --> 5609.28
paradox because of the mechanism and you

5606.96 --> 5610.88
cannot bypass it

5609.28 --> 5613.92
if you wish

5610.88 --> 5617.84
to establish the radius of earth

5613.92 --> 5621.6
then you can only do that

5617.84 --> 5621.6
by measuring the horizon

5622.639 --> 5627.28
right that's the only thing we got

5625.12 --> 5628.88
now if you think the horizon is not in

5627.28 --> 5630.639
the right place because a terrestrial

5628.88 --> 5632.4800000000005
refraction well then you don't have an r

5630.639 --> 5634.08
value then you never establish the

5632.48 --> 5635.12
radius of earth

5634.08 --> 5638.08
because

5635.12 --> 5640.8
eyes deceive you according to that

5638.08 --> 5643.6
notion of terrestrial refraction so you

5640.8 --> 5648.08
don't have a radius anymore you never

5643.6 --> 5648.08
had it you just made it up

5649.52 --> 5652.56
you see

5651.04 --> 5655.04
so no

5652.56 --> 5657.4400000000005
terrestrial refraction doesn't undo the

5655.04 --> 5660.48
black swan

5657.44 --> 5664.159
terrestrial refraction is literally you

5660.48 --> 5666.08
shooting yourself in the foot

5664.159 --> 5667.92
it's a paradox

5666.08 --> 5670.8
once you assume it then you could have

5667.92 --> 5672.639
never established the geometry of earth

5670.8 --> 5673.679
you could have never established the r

5672.639 --> 5675.36
value

5673.679 --> 5678.88
which you require

5675.36 --> 5678.88
if the earth was a sphere

5679.04 --> 5684.32
or is it irrelevant oh

5682.159 --> 5685.5199999999995
irrelevant

5684.32 --> 5687.84
that's just

5685.52 --> 5687.84
dandy

5688.56 --> 5693.320000000001
so it's come to this again has it

5709.6 --> 5715.6
it still exists you had no terrestrial

5712.4 --> 5716.879999999999
refraction though right because actual

5715.6 --> 5719.119000000001
refraction

5716.88 --> 5721.119
actual optics based

5719.119 --> 5723.28
refraction which has been studied very

5721.119 --> 5726.159
elaborately

5723.28 --> 5729.36
it doesn't displace

5726.159 --> 5730.159
the horizon

5729.36 --> 5731.599999999999
in

5730.159 --> 5732.4
relation

5731.6 --> 5735.1990000000005
to

5732.4 --> 5738.719
the horizon

5735.199 --> 5742.879999999999
it only displaces objects

5738.719 --> 5746.159
visible in relation to the horizon

5742.88 --> 5750.0
that's what real refraction does

5746.159 --> 5752.719
it's specifically noted when you look up

5750.0 --> 5753.92
the physics of refraction in the field

5752.719 --> 5757.44
of optics

5753.92 --> 5758.96
specifically noted the horizon doesn't

5757.44 --> 5761.5199999999995
displace

5758.96 --> 5764.08
in relation to the horizon because of

5761.52 --> 5766.0
refraction that never happens it's only

5764.08 --> 5768.4
things visible in relation to the

5766.0 --> 5771.76
horizon that displays

5768.4 --> 5774.799999999999
why is this it's very simple

5771.76 --> 5776.159000000001
the horizon isn't geometric

5774.8 --> 5779.1990000000005
because it's flat

5776.159 --> 5780.96
thus how we perceive it because of that

5779.199 --> 5782.799999999999
because of the lack of a spherical

5780.96 --> 5785.28
geometry

5782.8 --> 5789.679
it becomes purely optical it's purely

5785.28 --> 5789.679
dependent on the limit of sight

5789.92 --> 5795.28
that's what makes the horizon it's

5791.52 --> 5799.119000000001
purely optical it's an apparent effect

5795.28 --> 5802.5599999999995
it's not a edge it's not a object

5799.119 --> 5805.199
getting in the way of what's behind it

5802.56 --> 5808.4800000000005
it's a purely optical effect where the

5805.199 --> 5811.119
land meets the ground it visibly merges

5808.48 --> 5813.04
only visibly doesn't actually merge

5811.119 --> 5815.199
but to sight it does

5813.04 --> 5819.239
it's an apparent effect

5815.199 --> 5819.239
not a geometric one

5848.159 --> 5853.33
oh he sent that crap to you too mikey

5850.239 --> 5856.409
did he

5853.33 --> 5856.409
[Music]

5858.8 --> 5863.04
are you just repeating that same thing

5860.8 --> 5863.04
now

5864.0 --> 5870.32
can somebody help me decipher what mikey

5866.239 --> 5870.32
is saying right now it's very confusing

5871.199 --> 5874.96
i can get this email to you and help you

5874.08 --> 5876.239
greet

5874.96 --> 5879.04
now that's

5876.239 --> 5882.4
oh my god he's already set all that

5879.04 --> 5886.8
garbage i'm not gonna listen to it i'm

5882.4 --> 5886.799999999999
not gonna listen to it creep

5888.159 --> 5893.759999999999
you literally even said in it that's

5890.56 --> 5894.719
freaking okay ultra

5893.76 --> 5898.400000000001
like

5894.719 --> 5898.4
why would you listen to that

5904.48 --> 5910.32
oh get paid he already sent it to me and

5907.52 --> 5913.119000000001
he doesn't pay people he's a filthy

5910.32 --> 5913.119
scumbag

5914.639 --> 5921.36
like i'd call him a cia agent

5918.719 --> 5922.88
or something if i knew that

5921.36 --> 5924.799999999999
if i didn't know that that's actually

5922.88 --> 5926.56
kind of silly

5924.8 --> 5929.52
maybe he was

5926.56 --> 5931.360000000001
maybe he is just a really [ __ ] up

5929.52 --> 5934.400000000001
independent operator who's gone

5931.36 --> 5936.719
completely out of his mind and is really

5934.4 --> 5938.5599999999995
no longer human he's just a demon he's

5936.719 --> 5942.159
just trying to [ __ ] around with other

5938.56 --> 5942.159000000001
people like a demon does

5942.88 --> 5947.92
i don't know this guy i just know i

5945.84 --> 5950.719
he's not gonna pay you he doesn't pay

5947.92 --> 5953.04
people he never does

5950.719 --> 5955.36
he'll send you a little

5953.04 --> 5956.88
as soon as he promises you something

5955.36 --> 5958.5599999999995
just do this

5956.88 --> 5961.52
and then i'll pay you really big he

5958.56 --> 5964.639
never does it ever

5961.52 --> 5964.639
because he's a scumbag

5965.36 --> 5967.839999999999
right

5978.8 --> 5985.1990000000005
gave me 150 bucks no he didn't

5982.239 --> 5985.199
it wasn't that much

5985.52 --> 5990.080000000001
but yeah he donated to my channel that's

5987.76 --> 5991.52
right unconditionally that's how it

5990.08 --> 5993.5199999999995
works

5991.52 --> 5996.0
if you like what i do

5993.52 --> 5999.92
then please finance me please send money

5996.0 --> 6001.36
to my paypal i do really need it

5999.92 --> 6004.36
right but it's gonna have to be

6001.36 --> 6004.36
unconditional

6011.199 --> 6016.48
he pays well okay well fine you go work

6014.08 --> 6019.6
for him then you go work for that demon

6016.48 --> 6023.199
lunatic all you like

6019.6 --> 6028.119000000001
he's not paying me and i'm not gonna do

6023.199 --> 6028.119
what he says i'd rather die

6039.92 --> 6045.52
50 cent magnet yeah that's cute isn't it

6042.719 --> 6047.6
oh he sent it to me i got the magnets i

6045.52 --> 6052.639
showed them all the time right is he

6047.6 --> 6053.6
sending me 500 bucks no no he's not

6052.639 --> 6055.84
so

6053.6 --> 6058.719
only thing he's doing right now is

6055.84 --> 6060.4800000000005
paying you to harass me do you

6058.719 --> 6064.08
understand

6060.48 --> 6066.799999999999
are you okay with that

6064.08 --> 6070.96
are you okay with that mikey

6066.8 --> 6074.84
being paid by a lunatic to harass me

6070.96 --> 6074.84
is that okay with you

6094.32 --> 6097.199
no it's not true

6101.679 --> 6106.4
dude if he can send me money through

6104.239 --> 6108.239
paypal and i banned him i don't really

6106.4 --> 6110.638999999999
care anymore

6108.239 --> 6113.119
he sent me magnet so what's preventing

6110.639 --> 6115.92
him from literally putting

6113.119 --> 6117.92
paper money in an envelope and sending

6115.92 --> 6121.4
it to me right nothing nothing is

6117.92 --> 6121.4
preventing that

6123.199 --> 6128.4
right but i'm not gonna tolerate that

6126.239 --> 6131.678999999999
mother [ __ ]

6128.4 --> 6134.96
to keep sending me one cent paypal

6131.679 --> 6138.0
donations with blabbering insane chat

6134.96 --> 6140.719
nonsense which he was doing like 10

6138.0 --> 6143.52
times in a row yeah that's why i banned

6140.719 --> 6145.52
him from my paypal yeah i'm not going to

6143.52 --> 6146.88
be spammed to death by a freaking

6145.52 --> 6148.88
lunatic

6146.88 --> 6150.56
i don't care

6148.88 --> 6154.32
about the money i'm not going to be

6150.56 --> 6159.1990000000005
subjected to a lunatic for money do you

6154.32 --> 6159.199
understand you filthy demon scumbag

6159.36 --> 6165.04
you're not gonna taint me you're not

6162.32 --> 6169.4
gonna taint me with your [ __ ] little

6165.04 --> 6169.4
demon you get it

6181.55 --> 6184.669
[Music]

6186.88 --> 6192.0
he does know my address i literally

6189.52 --> 6193.679
wrote his address down

6192.0 --> 6196.239
in skype

6193.679 --> 6199.28
in its completion

6196.239 --> 6202.4
it's just lying this guy lies about

6199.28 --> 6204.96
everything about everything he's a liar

6202.4 --> 6208.159
he's a demon don't listen to him he's a

6204.96 --> 6211.84
liar he's a demon he'll lie and

6208.159 --> 6213.599999999999
manipulate everything everything he's a

6211.84 --> 6215.76
demon

6213.6 --> 6220.639
fully possessed

6215.76 --> 6220.639
there's nothing left of him nothing

6223.119 --> 6228.239
okay james mason don't know why you had

6225.679 --> 6228.2390000000005
to do that

6230.48 --> 6234.959999999999
but maybe it's for the better i was

6231.84 --> 6234.96
getting kind of sick of him

6236.8 --> 6242.159000000001
he's not gonna stop i think it is mark i

6239.44 --> 6243.599999999999
think it's literally mark i think it's

6242.159 --> 6244.638999999999
him again

6243.6 --> 6247.4400000000005
right

6244.639 --> 6250.719
because he's a demon he can't let it go

6247.44 --> 6253.759999999999
he's an obsessed little [ __ ]

6250.719 --> 6256.08
insane completely out of his mind

6253.76 --> 6259.88
obsessed

6256.08 --> 6259.88
mentally derailed

6263.119 --> 6267.599999999999
white noise

6265.52 --> 6269.76
a lot of it so much

6267.6 --> 6272.08
that he doesn't have any maneuvering

6269.76 --> 6273.92
room left to even perceive he's just

6272.08 --> 6275.199
rolling out his [ __ ] insanity

6273.92 --> 6279.04
constantly

6275.199 --> 6279.04
obsessed lying nonstop

6279.76 --> 6284.92
yeah he is winding us all up but that's

6281.6 --> 6284.92
over now

6288.15 --> 6291.259999999999
[Music]

6293.679 --> 6296.679
here

6303.44 --> 6306.239
oh you want to get banned too bobby

6305.199 --> 6307.119
stills

6306.239 --> 6310.08
huh

6307.119 --> 6310.08
you want to get banned

6312.8 --> 6316.400000000001
i don't even know what you're doing here

6314.4 --> 6318.159
actually you should have been bad i

6316.4 --> 6320.638999999999
guess it's one of your many sock

6318.159 --> 6320.638999999999
accounts

6321.119 --> 6325.5199999999995
i don't normally let a

6324.56 --> 6330.04
little

6325.52 --> 6330.040000000001
weasel like yourself in here

6345.84 --> 6348.84
mute

6370.159 --> 6373.839999999999
all right i'm gonna run out the show

6371.679 --> 6373.84
anyway

6374.48 --> 6379.5199999999995
can't believe that this guy just keeps

6376.88 --> 6379.52
on going

6382.56 --> 6385.679
i mean

6383.84 --> 6389.1990000000005
i think the best tactic would have been

6385.679 --> 6391.6
to just completely ignore him just tote

6389.199 --> 6394.879999999999
like not as soon as somebody literally

6391.6 --> 6396.320000000001
brings it up instant ban instant ban

6394.88 --> 6398.4800000000005
but

6396.32 --> 6401.36
at the same time i really don't remember

6398.48 --> 6404.08
anybody having been that insane

6401.36 --> 6406.48
like really clinical

6404.08 --> 6407.92
like clinical and dangerous potentially

6406.48 --> 6409.678999999999
i don't know because it's there there's

6407.92 --> 6412.88

6412.88 --> 6416.88
i wouldn't want to be near that guy [ __ ]

6424.719 --> 6430.56
freaking little demon like

6427.52 --> 6432.400000000001
biting my ankles constantly

6430.56 --> 6434.159000000001
constantly trying to get in there like a

6432.4 --> 6437.119
mosquito

6434.159 --> 6437.119
it's disgusting

6439.04 --> 6442.96

so yeah by the way please donate to my

6442.96 --> 6446.4800000000005
paypal i'd rather have it through people

6445.6 --> 6447.1990000000005
that

6446.48 --> 6448.959999999999
just

and i would really appreciate some

6457.199 --> 6461.678999999999
right

6458.48 --> 6464.959999999999
but i'd rather die

6461.679 --> 6468.119
than do what this disgusting swamp demon

6464.96 --> 6470.56
piece of [ __ ] wants me to do in order to

6468.119 --> 6473.599999999999
supposedly give me something i don't

6470.56 --> 6474.639
want that i don't want it

6473.6 --> 6475.52
i want

6474.639 --> 6478.32
you

6475.52 --> 6480.8
i want your money

6478.32 --> 6482.96
people that are actually crushing i want

6480.8 --> 6485.84
the blessing

6482.96 --> 6485.84
of that money

6490.56 --> 6494.8
right i don't want a big pile of money

6492.56 --> 6497.04
and then a wound

6494.8 --> 6499.6
on my spirit on top of that

6497.04 --> 6501.679
it's unacceptable

6499.6 --> 6503.360000000001
that would literally grind me to a halt

6501.679 --> 6505.119
in what i do

6503.36 --> 6508.96
it's unacceptable

6505.119 --> 6510.5599999999995
but i do need finances i really do i'm a

6508.96 --> 6514.4800000000005
poor bastard

6510.56 --> 6517.4400000000005
although not really a poor bastard

6514.48 --> 6518.159
but i guess by dutch standards i kind of

6517.44 --> 6519.36
am

6518.159 --> 6521.36
it's

6519.36 --> 6524.239
hard to tell

6521.36 --> 6527.839999999999
i just know that

6524.239 --> 6529.919999999999
i spent most of it on food

6527.84 --> 6532.8

6532.8 --> 6535.84
