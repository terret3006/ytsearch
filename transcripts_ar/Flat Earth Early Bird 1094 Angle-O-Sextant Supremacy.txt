159.44 --> 161.92
i uh

162.08 --> 166.959
i basically

164.16 --> 169.44
tried to do some groceries before the

166.959 --> 172.56
show again because yeah that worked out

169.44 --> 172.56
so well on monday

172.64 --> 179.27999999999997
so yeah i can basically be

175.12 --> 181.68
there the entire flat earth debate show

179.28 --> 184.72
and not leave in between

181.68 --> 185.92000000000002
right but yeah

184.72 --> 187.519
it

185.92 --> 190.23899999999998
yeah took a little longer than i

187.519 --> 191.92000000000002
expected so that's why i'm so late

190.239 --> 193.59900000000002
i was hoping like oh i'm just gonna be

191.92 --> 196.72
15 minutes late but yeah that turned

193.599 --> 198.23899999999998
into 40 minutes unfortunately

196.72 --> 201.84
uh

198.239 --> 201.84
but i'm here and i'm gonna have a

202.4 --> 207.92000000000002
at least another hour and 15 minutes for

205.36 --> 207.92000000000002
the show

211.04 --> 214.72
before i move on to the flat earth

212.64 --> 218.48
debates

214.72 --> 218.48
all right so how are you all doing

218.56 --> 224.0
had a very busy day yesterday

223.04 --> 227.319
like

224.0 --> 227.319
very busy

228.72 --> 231.04
right

234.72 --> 237.28
because

237.92 --> 242.39999999999998
yeah of course flat earth debates was a

239.84 --> 244.72
good show again

242.4 --> 244.72
and

245.04 --> 249.92
then later in the evening there was bo

247.439 --> 254.159
oh no not bubba's kiwi live

249.92 --> 256.71999999999997
and i got on to that as well

254.159 --> 258.479
this time i don't always do that a lot

256.72 --> 259.519
of the times i just joined the chat but

258.479 --> 261.28
i

259.519 --> 264.0
got in it

261.28 --> 265.67999999999995
and yeah it was interesting show

264.0 --> 268.16
funny

265.68 --> 269.919
lots of food talk but that seems to be

268.16 --> 272.88000000000005
like the new thing

269.919 --> 272.88
that they always do

274.08 --> 280.8
uh yeah and afterward

276.88 --> 284.479
it kind of stuck around after kiwi left

280.8 --> 286.16
and had this very long conversation

284.479 --> 288.56
uh adam meekin

286.16 --> 291.28000000000003
me and betty

288.56 --> 294.32
uh yeah concerning christianity

291.28 --> 296.479
and yeah that lasted long

294.32 --> 300.08
and then afterward we had like a two

296.479 --> 302.96
hour skype call on top of that so

300.08 --> 305.75899999999996
it was very late i've been talking so

302.96 --> 305.75899999999996
much yesterday

306.16 --> 311.52000000000004
so yeah i can literally feel it on my

308.88 --> 313.759
voice that it's like a little raspy

311.52 --> 316.4
because i've been just talking so much

313.759 --> 320.0
yesterday

316.4 --> 320.0
cheese talk yeah yeah

320.8 --> 326.8
right so anybody saw the ball busters

324.4 --> 329.28
i mean kiwi live keep calling it ball

326.8 --> 331.68
busters it's kiwi live in weekdays

329.28 --> 333.919
on tuesday

331.68 --> 337.28000000000003
because that's where i unveiled my

333.919 --> 339.84
latest meme joke which is also the title

337.28 --> 339.84
of the show

342.16 --> 345.96000000000004
don't know if anybody noticed

353.36 --> 358.84000000000003
stormy here off and on wins right

377.52 --> 380.52
right

381.68 --> 387.6
so yeah i wonder uh

384.8 --> 388.479
i wonder like

387.6 --> 390.08000000000004
if

388.479 --> 390.88
let's say

390.08 --> 395.12
like

390.88 --> 397.36
bots are gonna pick up onto it

395.12 --> 397.36
right

397.68 --> 403.919
if they're actually gonna think it's

400.639 --> 406.84000000000003
something else because it so closely

403.919 --> 410.479
resembles it

406.84 --> 410.479
phonetically i wonder

411.599 --> 414.96
got my hair cut oh

416.8 --> 419.52000000000004
oh my god

420.56 --> 426.84
haircut with a mask on that's

423.12 --> 426.84000000000003
that's totally absurd

438.479 --> 440.71999999999997
right

448.4 --> 454.63899999999995
right so yeah if you were a flat earther

452.479 --> 456.88
and you think that this accident is the

454.639 --> 458.40000000000003
ultimate weapon to defeat the globe and

456.88 --> 461.599
prove the flat earth

458.4 --> 465.31899999999996
then you are effectively an angle of

461.599 --> 465.319
sextant supremacist

480.72 --> 483.72
okay

498.24 --> 500.639
okay

501.039 --> 504.039
right

513.919 --> 516.919
do

520.08 --> 524.5600000000001
i'm now scrolling through what

522.399 --> 526.8
went down yesterday to see

524.56 --> 529.4399999999999
oh yeah flatter school of course

526.8 --> 532.76
mitchell from australia i was there too

529.44 --> 532.7600000000001
in the chat

534.88 --> 541.36
and mitchell dealing with this

537.279 --> 541.36
unbelievable clown planer walk

545.92 --> 550.0799999999999
like i'm going to just mention him the

548.32 --> 552.0
least possible because every time i

550.08 --> 555.6800000000001
think about it just makes me feel dirty

552.0 --> 555.68
that guy is so stupid

555.92 --> 561.88
like i have less problems mentioning the

558.24 --> 561.88
name sean hawkins

562.399 --> 568.72
then this guy

564.399 --> 571.92
with his disgusting nail polish ugh

568.72 --> 571.9200000000001
absolutely idiotic

574.48 --> 577.9200000000001
all right he made you chuckle okay good

576.48 --> 580.64
for you

577.92 --> 580.64
i'm just like

580.8 --> 583.8
yuck

601.6 --> 606.399
yeah gadget inspector that seems pretty

603.839 --> 609.36
much on target that description

606.399 --> 609.36
of his activities

609.6 --> 614.0
of nail varnish right i call it nail

612.0 --> 614.88
polish it's nail varnish yeah yeah he

614.0 --> 618.76
does

614.88 --> 618.76
like in that video

634.0 --> 636.48
right

634.88 --> 639.68
i'm going to remember that i always call

636.48 --> 641.9200000000001
it nail polish but it's varnish varnish

639.68 --> 644.92
varnish varnish varnish

641.92 --> 644.92
right

648.56 --> 653.5999999999999
after all these years i still have to

650.64 --> 655.8389999999999
brush up on my english lingo

653.6 --> 655.839
ah

656.64 --> 660.36
that keeps you busy

661.44 --> 667.0400000000001
at least i'm like getting measurably

663.279 --> 667.04
better at it over the years

668.079 --> 672.8389999999999
polish is okay too really

671.519 --> 676.16
that

672.839 --> 678.9590000000001
works but like polish is effectively

676.16 --> 678.959
something different

679.6 --> 682.48
is both

681.44 --> 686.1600000000001
okay

682.48 --> 688.48
okay now i'm just really confused

686.16 --> 691.6
but fine care apparently i can call it

688.48 --> 691.6
polish sure

693.2 --> 696.9590000000001
it's more america americans call it

695.2 --> 699.12
polish okay it's

696.959 --> 700.88
not confusing at all but

699.12 --> 703.839
yeah it is

700.88 --> 703.8389999999999
fine

712.24 --> 717.519
right

713.76 --> 718.8
oh yeah excuse me i know very little

717.519 --> 719.76
about

718.8 --> 721.3599999999999
that

719.76 --> 723.76
in general

721.36 --> 725.44
because i'm not a [ __ ]

723.76 --> 727.92
and i'm not gonna be like a guy that

725.44 --> 730.48
pretends to be oh oh but

727.92 --> 732.7199999999999
men can wear that too

730.48 --> 732.72
like

735.279 --> 740.639
right

736.399 --> 740.639
but i'm not gonna get too much into that

741.519 --> 744.88
i mean i have like taken care of my

743.76 --> 747.8389999999999
nails

744.88 --> 751.76
literally like polish them but i'm not

747.839 --> 751.7600000000001
going to put like color on it

751.839 --> 754.0790000000001
nope

755.68 --> 760.88
but yeah taking care of your nails is

757.92 --> 760.88
it's not a bad thing

762.88 --> 766.56
right if you're going to prevent

765.519 --> 768.88
like

766.56 --> 770.079
what you call that nails breaking and

768.88 --> 772.32
then

770.079 --> 774.4799999999999
getting like wounds and [ __ ] that [ __ ]

772.32 --> 776.0790000000001
is really painful right yeah that's

774.48 --> 779.04
sensible thing to do take care of your

776.079 --> 780.56
nails but yeah if you're gonna put

779.04 --> 782.959
varnish on it

780.56 --> 782.959
that's

783.279 --> 789.76
just really really gay

786.88 --> 789.76
unless you're a woman

791.44 --> 794.9590000000001
arguably i don't know

798.56 --> 801.8389999999999
all right pj crew shank

808.48 --> 813.519
he waves around his hands too

811.839 --> 816.9590000000001
right i

813.519 --> 818.639
but look i couldn't watch that video

816.959 --> 822.56
like i can't i could

818.639 --> 825.6
listen to it but i have to look away

822.56 --> 829.04
i i have to look away

825.6 --> 830.0
what that gay guy gay freudian slip

829.04 --> 834.7199999999999
there

830.0 --> 834.72
what he radiates is just

836.0 --> 838.24
i

839.68 --> 843.7199999999999
he irradiates cyclists

844.079 --> 847.4399999999999
sickness or how do you call that

846.079 --> 850.3199999999999
sickishly

847.44 --> 853.519
just this sexually radiance

850.32 --> 857.12
disgusting like i don't want to

853.519 --> 858.8
get into it it just makes me sick so i

857.12 --> 861.279
like it's like oh i'll see him and then

858.8 --> 863.12
i see a move and i'm like okay after

861.279 --> 864.8
like three seconds i know enough i'm not

863.12 --> 867.6
just not gonna look at that screen

864.8 --> 869.199
anymore i mean i'll listen to see what

867.6 --> 872.0790000000001
he's gonna blabber about i'm just not

869.199 --> 872.079
gonna look at it

872.56 --> 879.3599999999999
exactly ew is his vibe exactly

877.04 --> 882.0
but he just also looks kind of sickly

879.36 --> 884.72
you know like that's not a healthy

882.0 --> 887.279
looking guy he looks like greasy and

884.72 --> 887.279
pale and

895.199 --> 899.5999999999999
maybe it's just also terrible lighting

898.16 --> 901.6
and i'm pretty sure he made that video

899.6 --> 904.0790000000001
in the evening i don't know i don't i

901.6 --> 906.32
don't want to get into it anymore it's

904.079 --> 906.3199999999999
just

906.48 --> 910.32
i find it not quite repulsive

910.88 --> 914.8
gangly

912.56 --> 914.8
what

923.6 --> 927.839
a transformer you think

928.959 --> 934.2399999999999
what yeah you think that he might be

931.04 --> 934.24
like a cross-dresser

936.639 --> 939.6
i

937.92 --> 942.079
i don't care

939.6 --> 944.8000000000001
he might i don't wanna i don't wanna

942.079 --> 944.8
think about it

947.04 --> 950.56
a rubber ducky uh

952.72 --> 955.839
let's move on okay

961.199 --> 966.12
right so look at the beautiful weather

974.639 --> 980.48
i wore enough indoors yeah yeah

977.68 --> 982.7199999999999
well because i had like my

980.48 --> 985.759
grocery shopping

982.72 --> 987.0400000000001
i basically did physical workout so i'm

985.759 --> 989.04
not yeah

987.04 --> 991.36
that's also the reason i thought like

989.04 --> 993.759
maybe i should try to figure out how to

991.36 --> 995.759
do this from now on like this

993.759 --> 999.04
get a bit moving

995.759 --> 1000.8000000000001
before i start the show instead of after

999.04 --> 1002.8
in the winter time at least so i get a

1000.8 --> 1005.12
little warmed up physically before i

1002.8 --> 1006.4799999999999
start

1005.12 --> 1008.48
right

1006.48 --> 1010.399
so i was pretty much able now in this

1008.48 --> 1012.399
show to kind of be

1010.399 --> 1015.12
energetic and awake right away instead

1012.399 --> 1017.6
of like having to spend 15 to 30 minutes

1015.12 --> 1017.6
like a bit

1017.68 --> 1020.399
just waiting

1019.199 --> 1022.4799999999999
because that

1020.399 --> 1026.799
has been typically happening at the

1022.48 --> 1030.16
start of my shows it's bit of a nuisance

1026.799 --> 1031.679
eventually it gets rolling always but

1030.16 --> 1033.76
yeah now

1031.679 --> 1036.16
if i just do a little physical exercise

1033.76 --> 1038.16
right before then i you then there's no

1036.16 --> 1040.48
waiting period

1038.16 --> 1040.48
all right

1041.76 --> 1047.199
there's no slow moment

1044.24 --> 1047.199
oh raining there

1047.439 --> 1050.96
hello cleary

1049.12 --> 1052.7199999999998
good servant

1050.96 --> 1054.08
let's see you

1052.72 --> 1056.64
mark me

1054.08 --> 1056.6399999999999
words

1056.799 --> 1062.16
why the obsession with sextants

1060.0 --> 1065.039
what do you think

1062.16 --> 1067.679
because it proves the earth is flat

1065.039 --> 1070.32
in the black swan

1067.679 --> 1072.64
argument observation proof the earth is

1070.32 --> 1074.799
not a ball

1072.64 --> 1077.039
right that's it it doesn't prove the

1074.799 --> 1079.12
earth is it just proves it's not a ball

1077.039 --> 1080.48
it doesn't lay out what the exact

1079.12 --> 1082.6399999999999
geometry is

1080.48 --> 1085.84
the sextant however

1082.64 --> 1085.8400000000001
does exactly that

1089.919 --> 1095.8400000000001
right and you're going to need a 90

1092.559 --> 1095.84
degree angle for that

1096.64 --> 1102.3600000000001
henceforth the angle of sextant

1099.36 --> 1102.36
supremacy

1118.08 --> 1122.36
no never heard of him

1123.679 --> 1128.44
is that like a pottery show or something

1144.72 --> 1148.6000000000001
effie okay

1156.64 --> 1160.0
bible reference okay

1161.84 --> 1167.76
well look guys in general i'm not the

1164.88 --> 1169.679
type that really goes out there and just

1167.76 --> 1172.08
checks out all kinds of new channels all

1169.679 --> 1172.0800000000002
the time

1172.24 --> 1175.6
because i don't have the patience i

1173.76 --> 1177.36
don't have the time and there is things

1175.6 --> 1180.32
that i'm basically studying i'm

1177.36 --> 1182.24
following it and i'm studying that

1180.32 --> 1184.1599999999999
sort of professionally

1182.24 --> 1186.72
for myself

1184.16 --> 1189.2
like how i basically keep following alex

1186.72 --> 1189.2
jones

1190.84 --> 1196.32
like i study it

1193.84 --> 1198.6399999999999
i study how it has developed how

1196.32 --> 1201.039
everybody changes

1198.64 --> 1201.039
in there

1203.2 --> 1208.4
and then try to figure out where i

1204.88 --> 1210.3200000000002
predict that they with their spirits

1208.4 --> 1213.2800000000002
will maneuver towards

1210.32 --> 1215.52
and that is like that only works if you

1213.28 --> 1217.44
like constantly follow it if you have if

1215.52 --> 1219.44
you keep track daily because then you

1217.44 --> 1221.919
get to see all the phases that people go

1219.44 --> 1224.64
through just like you guys

1221.919 --> 1225.76
follow my development by watching me

1224.64 --> 1227.6000000000001
daily

1225.76 --> 1228.64
and then you just get to see what i go

1227.6 --> 1230.3999999999999
through

1228.64 --> 1233.5200000000002
and you also get to see

1230.4 --> 1235.44
how through the cycles eventually

1233.52 --> 1239.36
like things start to change even though

1235.44 --> 1241.28
the cycle format is roughly the same

1239.36 --> 1244.3999999999999
how it manifests

1241.28 --> 1248.24
like slightly changes over time

1244.4 --> 1249.52
how more nervousness panic insecurity

1248.24 --> 1252.32
kind of

1249.52 --> 1252.32
drops off

1252.72 --> 1256.919
how i improve my lingo

1255.28 --> 1260.6
how i

1256.919 --> 1262.48
reorganize my long-term objectives in my

1260.6 --> 1264.3999999999999
associations right

1262.48 --> 1266.799
you can keep track of that by just

1264.4 --> 1269.039
watching me daily and then if you have

1266.799 --> 1271.28
the eye and the sensitivity and the

1269.039 --> 1273.44
interest

1271.28 --> 1275.6
then you can see

1273.44 --> 1278.159
how is this guy developing over time

1275.6 --> 1280.559
doing what he does and i do that with

1278.159 --> 1280.5590000000002
others

1281.12 --> 1285.12
i do it with everybody that i follow

1283.28 --> 1286.32
it's like okay if i'm gonna follow you

1285.12 --> 1288.559
every day

1286.32 --> 1291.4399999999998
that is going to end up happening

1288.559 --> 1294.0
because it's part of my human studies

1291.44 --> 1294.0
basically

1295.36 --> 1300.799
but yeah that causes the day to be

1298.0 --> 1303.44
roughly filled out with a set

1300.799 --> 1304.96
group right i don't have like the time

1303.44 --> 1306.48
to constantly like oh what's this

1304.96 --> 1308.159
channel i'm gonna check it out i'm gonna

1306.48 --> 1310.559
dig through and watch like three four

1308.159 --> 1312.159
videos i just don't have the time for

1310.559 --> 1315.039
that

1312.159 --> 1317.1200000000001
so in that sense i'm kind of dependent

1315.039 --> 1321.12
on other guys

1317.12 --> 1323.6
to do that in their own time and then

1321.12 --> 1327.6
yeah if it's kind of interesting to

1323.6 --> 1327.6
relay that and then i might check it out

1328.72 --> 1333.679
but i'm not just like oh what's what's

1331.28 --> 1337.12
new on the internet i'm just gonna

1333.679 --> 1339.919
dig around in random stuff no i i don't

1337.12 --> 1341.9189999999999
have the time and the patience

1339.919 --> 1344.919
and a lot of times not the energy for it

1341.919 --> 1344.919
either

1353.12 --> 1357.039
potter's clay fashion his channel my

1355.2 --> 1360.039

uh

1418.159 --> 1422.159
is that a rename or is that like a

1420.0 --> 1424.32
completely new channel because

1422.159 --> 1426.96
it's again a tommy

1424.32 --> 1429.9189999999999
he's like a professional boxer right he

1426.96 --> 1431.8400000000001
comes on the flat earth debate sometimes

1429.919 --> 1433.1200000000001
really rambly

1431.84 --> 1434.8799999999999
like when he starts to talk he doesn't

1433.12 --> 1438.3999999999999
know when to shut up but he's a pretty

1434.88 --> 1440.5590000000002
cool guy very spirited

1438.4 --> 1442.4
i talk about his channel because i don't

1440.559 --> 1444.1589999999999
know maybe he called himself flat

1442.4 --> 1446.159
earthbox or are you talking about

1444.159 --> 1449.279
something completely different

1446.159 --> 1449.279
he's english by the way

1454.72 --> 1458.3600000000001
slow mo moon buggy

1467.039 --> 1469.44
oh look

1468.24 --> 1471.039
you can

1469.44 --> 1474.4
since you have a wrench you can link it

1471.039 --> 1474.4
up right if you want to share

1476.159 --> 1481.279
right then people have an opportunity to

1478.24 --> 1481.279
kind of like check it out

1482.0 --> 1487.0
hey woodworking gunny bear good to see

1484.0 --> 1487.0
you

1491.84 --> 1495.4399999999998
yes

1492.88 --> 1498.159
a woodworking gunny bear i know you hang

1495.44 --> 1501.2
around like with the bear crowd

1498.159 --> 1504.0800000000002
spread the word bro

1501.2 --> 1508.0
we're making our move we are the angle

1504.08 --> 1508.0
of sextant supremacists

1509.76 --> 1515.52
i know the bears if if they understand

1512.88 --> 1519.3600000000001
the joke would appreciate the the

1515.52 --> 1519.36
sentiment spread the word

1519.679 --> 1526.3600000000001
i'm gonna drop it over at jim bob's too

1522.24 --> 1526.36
if he's gonna do a stream tonight

1542.72 --> 1547.6000000000001
hello mandy

1544.24 --> 1549.1200000000001
lifeboats effie friend finder had

1547.6 --> 1550.7199999999998
lots of details

1549.12 --> 1553.4399999999998
on view

1550.72 --> 1554.84
that should have been hidden

1553.44 --> 1556.72
really

1554.84 --> 1559.6
how

1556.72 --> 1561.3600000000001
i mean aren't you just as a participant

1559.6 --> 1563.039
able

1561.36 --> 1564.9599999999998
to determine

1563.039 --> 1569.0
what information should be publicly

1564.96 --> 1569.0
shared and what wouldn't

1577.52 --> 1581.9189999999999
i mean

1579.2 --> 1584.0
it seems a little weird like a friend

1581.919 --> 1584.88
like if you're gonna join something to

1584.0 --> 1587.76
be

1584.88 --> 1589.6000000000001
visible on a list

1587.76 --> 1592.4
you're not gonna fill in information you

1589.6 --> 1592.3999999999999
don't wanna share

1594.4 --> 1597.52
like

1595.2 --> 1599.2
in a block a story or whatever a

1597.52 --> 1600.96
description right

1599.2 --> 1603.2
but yeah at the same time you wouldn't

1600.96 --> 1606.48
expect like your email to just be

1603.2 --> 1608.0
publicly available necessarily

1606.48 --> 1610.32
or like your

1608.0 --> 1613.44
your personal identity codes

1610.32 --> 1615.039
registration stuff you write that

1613.44 --> 1615.76
password

1615.039 --> 1617.44
but

1615.76 --> 1619.919
if you're gonna fill in just like oh

1617.44 --> 1622.0800000000002
this is me this is what i do yeah duh of

1619.919 --> 1624.4
course that's gonna be available now if

1622.08 --> 1626.72
you're just ridiculous about it and fill

1624.4 --> 1628.88
it in like in the half width

1626.72 --> 1631.2
yeah that's gonna look crazy but

1628.88 --> 1633.8400000000001
that people put that there

1631.2 --> 1633.8400000000001
themselves

1635.919 --> 1641.8400000000001
so to say there is things visible that

1639.2 --> 1645.1200000000001
shouldn't be

1641.84 --> 1647.9189999999999
well that that can't be up to the

1645.12 --> 1650.1589999999999
yeah the the maintenance of the app

1647.919 --> 1653.24
that's up to the people that participate

1650.159 --> 1653.24
in that

1654.72 --> 1658.48
a security breach on the app oh

1657.52 --> 1661.279
really

1658.48 --> 1664.24
okay that's another matter then

1661.279 --> 1664.24
that is troublesome

1664.559 --> 1669.799
all details

1666.799 --> 1669.799
what

1672.0 --> 1677.919
oh so they didn't have any security

1674.32 --> 1681.24
system for that okay that is kind of bad

1677.919 --> 1681.24
that's sloppy

1683.12 --> 1685.9189999999999
i mean i don't even understand there's

1684.88 --> 1688.72
like

1685.919 --> 1688.72
cis like

1688.799 --> 1692.0
modules

1690.399 --> 1695.039
for that

1692.0 --> 1697.44
in programming so that's weird

1695.039 --> 1700.08
they didn't apply like a privacy

1697.44 --> 1701.6000000000001
information gathering module that's

1700.08 --> 1705.52
weird

1701.6 --> 1705.52
that's very unprofessional

1705.679 --> 1709.159
if that's true

1717.76 --> 1720.72
okay

1719.12 --> 1722.559
all right well that makes sense getting

1720.72 --> 1723.44
inspector because that is how that works

1722.559 --> 1724.8799999999999
right

1723.44 --> 1726.48
that's just like

1724.88 --> 1729.1200000000001
how

1726.48 --> 1733.3600000000001
banks and

1729.12 --> 1735.6
security like building security

1733.36 --> 1737.4399999999998
tests like they just

1735.6 --> 1739.36
get a professional

1737.44 --> 1741.279
the professional

1739.36 --> 1744.7199999999998
figures out the weaknesses like figures

1741.279 --> 1747.279
out like can i hack these locks

1744.72 --> 1749.6000000000001
like can i bypass with the security

1747.279 --> 1751.52
setup and then

1749.6 --> 1753.9189999999999
they report like okay this is

1751.52 --> 1755.52
insufficient that is insufficient

1753.919 --> 1758.5590000000002
this needs to be improved that needs to

1755.52 --> 1760.32
be improved right that's a logical thing

1758.559 --> 1765.08
to do

1760.32 --> 1765.08
in the physical world and also digitally

1771.919 --> 1775.96
it doesn't matter if he's a baller

1780.88 --> 1785.0390000000002
okay well hey mark mere woods that's

1784.159 --> 1788.48
yeah

1785.039 --> 1792.039
fine okay so it's insufficient oh i has

1788.48 --> 1792.039
to fix that then

1812.08 --> 1815.76
what five-hour talk

1819.2 --> 1824.96
we don't prove things phd in astronomy

1822.32 --> 1824.96
yeah yeah

1825.44 --> 1831.679
it's been fixed now okay okay well

1827.44 --> 1831.679
that's good at least it's fixed right

1832.48 --> 1838.3990000000001
yeah well good good on him

1834.88 --> 1842.48
right look when you're gonna have like

1838.399 --> 1845.36
community software software on the web

1842.48 --> 1847.919
that is like dealing

1845.36 --> 1849.039
with people and people's information

1847.919 --> 1851.279
yeah

1849.039 --> 1853.44
there's always going to be like security

1851.279 --> 1856.88
details that need to be figured out over

1853.44 --> 1856.88
time that's all natural

1857.76 --> 1863.679
right unless they had like massive

1860.96 --> 1865.44
investment and like all pre-planned like

1863.679 --> 1868.3990000000001
okay this is going to have the latest

1865.44 --> 1871.039
security etc etc that's all super

1868.399 --> 1871.039
expensive

1875.12 --> 1878.32
and

1876.64 --> 1881.76
yeah i don't know i don't think that

1878.32 --> 1883.76
david weiss is like a a pro at that sort

1881.76 --> 1884.72
of thing i think he's like trying this

1883.76 --> 1888.399
out

1884.72 --> 1892.84
right tries a lot of things out

1888.399 --> 1892.84
he just take the guy takes initiative

1893.279 --> 1898.72
like

1894.399 --> 1898.7199999999998
does new projects new things

1899.6 --> 1903.6
so yeah he's gonna be

1901.2 --> 1905.8400000000001
he's gonna have like newbie obstacles

1903.6 --> 1908.6399999999999
this is only normal when you do that

1905.84 --> 1911.279
it's nothing to be ashamed of

1908.64 --> 1912.159
although yeah you should

1911.279 --> 1914.159
like

1912.159 --> 1916.3200000000002
increase the learning curve for yourself

1914.159 --> 1917.7600000000002
otherwise eventually you will look kind

1916.32 --> 1920.399
of like a

1917.76 --> 1923.76
somebody that's always late

1920.399 --> 1923.76
in the game but anyway

1924.48 --> 1929.279
at least

1925.679 --> 1929.279
it's fixed and that's good

1930.799 --> 1935.399
rob shouts into the void

1935.44 --> 1943.519
from november 25th i i don't know

1939.44 --> 1943.519
youtube i don't i haven't seen that

1946.399 --> 1951.5189999999998
maybe tony did bring it up at the time i

1948.88 --> 1955.64
kind of like slit my mind i was the time

1951.519 --> 1955.64
when i kind of was sick so

1963.6 --> 1969.4399999999998
we don't prove things

1967.12 --> 1969.4399999999998
yep

1972.08 --> 1975.6789999999999
you feel bad from that this well seek no

1974.559 --> 1976.96
no but

1975.679 --> 1978.3200000000002
look

1976.96 --> 1980.72
the ballers

1978.32 --> 1983.2
she said they're using it to shame him

1980.72 --> 1985.679
that's what they do they do that always

1983.2 --> 1987.44
with anything i don't think david wise

1985.679 --> 1989.3600000000001
is really ashamed of it because that's

1987.44 --> 1992.24
just a

1989.36 --> 1994.7199999999998
a natural hazard

1992.24 --> 1996.32
right that that doesn't just happen to

1994.72 --> 1998.48
flat earth that happens to every the

1996.32 --> 2000.08
difference is is that

1998.48 --> 2002.3990000000001
flat earthers are going to be

2000.08 --> 2005.4399999999998
automatically

2002.399 --> 2007.5189999999998
shamed by the ballers who are like

2005.44 --> 2009.679
really eager to find those types of

2007.519 --> 2011.279
things and then make flat earthers look

2009.679 --> 2012.3990000000001
bad with them

2011.279 --> 2014.32
so

2012.399 --> 2015.76
now of course that also happens in other

2014.32 --> 2018.399
polarized

2015.76 --> 2020.64
regions polarized subjects

2018.399 --> 2023.279
political and all that

2020.64 --> 2023.279
even worse

2024.72 --> 2027.519
why

2025.679 --> 2030.88
did

2027.519 --> 2030.88
mike sidunich what are you doing

2030.96 --> 2033.8400000000001
are you pocket banning

2034.24 --> 2040.44
why are you removing youtube's messages

2036.88 --> 2040.44
i don't get it

2066.159 --> 2070.879
right yeah youtube

2067.919 --> 2072.56
they don't prove things but they expect

2070.879 --> 2074.399
people to take them seriously right

2072.56 --> 2076.32
because they've conditioned

2074.399 --> 2077.44
they've been conditioned that that's the

2076.32 --> 2079.9190000000003
way

2077.44 --> 2082.48
it's supposed to go and it's okay

2079.919 --> 2085.919
like it's okay for them

2082.48 --> 2085.919
that they don't prove things

2086.0 --> 2089.839
because that's how the conditioning

2087.919 --> 2092.56
works

2089.839 --> 2095.7599999999998
right same by the way goes for well

2092.56 --> 2098.64
political situations

2095.76 --> 2100.6400000000003
especially extreme left like yeah you

2098.64 --> 2102.48
just complain about details what your

2100.64 --> 2104.7999999999997
opponent is doing

2102.48 --> 2107.599
and then you do it yourself and much

2104.8 --> 2109.3590000000004
worse and nobody lifts a finger or says

2107.599 --> 2111.6800000000003
a word about it

2109.359 --> 2111.68
yeah

2112.8 --> 2121.28
the sickness is political

2116.48 --> 2123.119
it's hypocrisy like strong deeply rooted

2121.28 --> 2125.44
hypocrisy

2123.119 --> 2127.92
wrote it in

2125.44 --> 2130.8
like yeah we can do whatever we want

2127.92 --> 2133.839
because we are righteous they

2130.8 --> 2136.32
will be criticized about every freaking

2133.839 --> 2139.2799999999997
detail

2136.32 --> 2141.839
yeah that's that's political

2139.28 --> 2141.8390000000004
basically

2141.92 --> 2146.2400000000002
and a lot of globers especially

2143.839 --> 2148.56
anti-flat earthers are zealously

2146.24 --> 2151.52
political in their attitude

2148.56 --> 2155.0
towards flat earth so yeah

2151.52 --> 2155.0
it's to be expected

2162.88 --> 2167.92
no mistake david why is his software

2165.2 --> 2170.24
attracts you to you well yeah that

2167.92 --> 2174.64
that's like the entire point is to

2170.24 --> 2174.64
locate that's the point george sanford

2174.88 --> 2179.599
right and besides the tracking

2177.44 --> 2181.92
mike sidunich

2179.599 --> 2184.88
what the [ __ ] dude i'm taking away your

2181.92 --> 2187.04
wrench you have no control over your

2184.88 --> 2189.76
over your mobile this is really getting

2187.04 --> 2189.7599999999998
on my nerves

2190.24 --> 2193.5989999999997
where the [ __ ] is he anyway

2193.92 --> 2197.359
since spoke up for like

2196.24 --> 2199.1189999999997
forever

2197.359 --> 2201.839
okay let's scroll back all the way to

2199.119 --> 2201.839
the beginning

2202.48 --> 2205.2
where is he

2213.44 --> 2216.88
did he speak up at all

2219.599 --> 2223.079
what the hell

2230.72 --> 2234.64
okay i'm going to go into

2234.96 --> 2240.32
my settings specifically to take that

2237.359 --> 2242.72
away mike's is unacceptable

2240.32 --> 2245.52
you don't speak up you apparently you're

2242.72 --> 2246.8799999999997
not listening while you are in chat and

2245.52 --> 2248.72
chat banning

2246.88 --> 2250.4
people's messages

2248.72 --> 2254.72
right while you're not even listening

2250.4 --> 2259.0
that's absolutely utterly unacceptable

2254.72 --> 2259.0
so say goodbye to your wrench

2276.72 --> 2278.9599999999996
done

2281.52 --> 2286.24
if you can't have it if you can't

2284.4 --> 2288.48
get a grip

2286.24 --> 2291.2799999999997
on your interface yeah then

2288.48 --> 2294.56
you're not gonna get the wrench

2291.28 --> 2296.88
i don't see mike in here

2294.56 --> 2296.88
yeah

2297.28 --> 2302.8
i don't see him either but he is

2299.68 --> 2306.7999999999997
effectively banning people's messages

2302.8 --> 2306.8
that's exactly what it says so

2307.44 --> 2311.04
i don't know maybe it's freaking mobile

2309.2 --> 2314.72
some kind of weird virus or something i

2311.04 --> 2314.72
don't know it's not my problem anymore

2315.119 --> 2320.6400000000003
whose wrench is this i already i just

2318.16 --> 2325.3999999999996
said that seth willenberg

2320.64 --> 2325.4
i literally just said it

2341.92 --> 2347.2000000000003
surprised that vikings have become so

2344.64 --> 2347.2
docile

2349.76 --> 2353.92
well yeah

2351.359 --> 2356.16
well it's descendant of vikings vikings

2353.92 --> 2356.16
right

2364.88 --> 2369.359
right and i do believe it i do believe

2367.359 --> 2371.7599999999998
that's possible you know why

2369.359 --> 2374.16
because vikings

2371.76 --> 2377.28
were a culture

2374.16 --> 2379.92
a culture based on actions and death

2377.28 --> 2383.599
people dying right

2379.92 --> 2387.359
so it's like a perpetual war thing

2383.599 --> 2388.96
and that keeps you strong it's a warrior

2387.359 --> 2391.92
culture

2388.96 --> 2394.4
and that doesn't exist anymore right so

2391.92 --> 2396.88
what made them really good at it is that

2394.4 --> 2399.6800000000003
they were really programmable and could

2396.88 --> 2401.44
get really into the viking mode

2399.68 --> 2403.5989999999997
now they're all being trained to be

2401.44 --> 2406.64
[ __ ] and all embarrassed about

2403.599 --> 2407.599
themselves and as gay as possible so now

2406.64 --> 2409.359
that's

2407.599 --> 2411.6800000000003
what they're trying to do

2409.359 --> 2414.24
just as back then they were trying to be

2411.68 --> 2416.48
vikings see it makes perfect sense it

2414.24 --> 2419.359
just means that these people are very

2416.48 --> 2419.359
programmable

2419.76 --> 2423.76
that's basically it it shouldn't

2421.599 --> 2426.1600000000003
surprise you that the vikings of old

2423.76 --> 2428.4
that their ancestors now are complete

2426.16 --> 2430.16
wussies and facts

2428.4 --> 2431.44
because they're very

2430.16 --> 2433.52
trainable

2431.44 --> 2434.8
and they're now being trained to be just

2433.52 --> 2437.599
that

2434.8 --> 2440.079
if that turns around they'll be just two

2437.599 --> 2442.48
generations it'll be like vikings just

2440.079 --> 2444.0
the same again right

2442.48 --> 2448.28
but

2444.0 --> 2448.28
yeah that's not happening just yet

2455.359 --> 2458.359
uh

2474.48 --> 2478.64
really left wing these days

2476.48 --> 2479.76
well have you ever considered that the

2478.64 --> 2482.4
old

2479.76 --> 2484.5600000000004
in the old times when the vikings were

2482.4 --> 2487.44
going out

2484.56 --> 2489.52
pillaging other lands

2487.44 --> 2491.839
that they were really leftist too back

2489.52 --> 2495.839
then ever considered that

2491.839 --> 2495.839
maybe that's just the way they are right

2496.24 --> 2499.7599999999998
i mean

2497.44 --> 2501.599
leftists are always

2499.76 --> 2505.2000000000003
righteous and like oh

2501.599 --> 2506.96
they're bad they should do that but then

2505.2 --> 2510.0789999999997
when push comes to shove they'll

2506.96 --> 2512.4
literally just like assault and genocide

2510.079 --> 2513.6800000000003
people

2512.4 --> 2516.079
just like that

2513.68 --> 2518.64
like a frenzy

2516.079 --> 2521.04
that kind of still fits the viking

2518.64 --> 2523.68
profile right just because oh back then

2521.04 --> 2526.4
they were all mad and beards and basic

2523.68 --> 2529.52
common sense yeah that doesn't make you

2526.4 --> 2531.44
right wing that makes you

2529.52 --> 2532.88
from a completely different era where

2531.44 --> 2533.92
there's other

2532.88 --> 2536.48
normal

2533.92 --> 2537.44
normalcy normal levels

2536.48 --> 2540.16
right

2537.44 --> 2542.319
they were probably left wing compared to

2540.16 --> 2544.0789999999997
the rest of the people

2542.319 --> 2548.119
on the continent

2544.079 --> 2548.119
have you ever considered that

2550.079 --> 2555.8390000000004
were great for what vikings

2553.04 --> 2558.319
were great farmers really

2555.839 --> 2558.319
were they

2563.68 --> 2569.44
that seems really difficult though right

2567.04 --> 2572.24
the super cold lands like there's not

2569.44 --> 2572.2400000000002
it's not easy

2573.92 --> 2579.839
i mean they're not gonna have like giant

2575.68 --> 2579.839
stockpiles of food every year

2580.079 --> 2584.0
unless yeah well they loot some

2584.64 --> 2592.2
yes okay fine i don't know if they were

2588.64 --> 2592.2
if you say so

2601.92 --> 2607.04
not very lefty yeah but what is lefty

2604.88 --> 2609.52
right don't compare it to

2607.04 --> 2611.7599999999998
leftists now because they are full on

2609.52 --> 2613.44
possessed demons think about what it

2611.76 --> 2616.0
used to be

2613.44 --> 2617.2000000000003
and what effectively happens

2616.0 --> 2618.4
what do

2617.2 --> 2619.4399999999996
left

2618.4 --> 2622.0
wing

2619.44 --> 2625.44
groups do like think

2622.0 --> 2628.0
the last 200 years not just the last

2625.44 --> 2630.2400000000002
decade okay

2628.0 --> 2634.079
the last deck that's not leftist that's

2630.24 --> 2636.56
demonically possessed deranged people

2634.079 --> 2640.48
okay that's not a leftist

2636.56 --> 2641.7599999999998
demonically deranged people

2640.48 --> 2643.68
yeah

2641.76 --> 2647.28
don't compare them to that nothing

2643.68 --> 2650.3999999999996
compares to that except maybe

2647.28 --> 2652.96
like how nobility acted

2650.4 --> 2655.52
right before the french revolution

2652.96 --> 2658.2400000000002
right demonically possessed maniacs

2655.52 --> 2663.079
that's what that is it's not left wing

2658.24 --> 2663.0789999999997
it's not in balance with anything

2672.72 --> 2676.56
i'm just saying

2674.24 --> 2677.68
maybe the vikings in the time when there

2676.56 --> 2680.16
went

2677.68 --> 2683.72
looting other countries maybe they were

2680.16 --> 2683.72
leftist too

2700.319 --> 2704.88
right and that doesn't mean like oh they

2702.8 --> 2706.1600000000003
were

2704.88 --> 2708.079
as gay

2706.16 --> 2710.0
as they are now

2708.079 --> 2710.88
maybe they were so i don't know were

2710.0 --> 2712.72
they

2710.88 --> 2714.88
is that even known

2712.72 --> 2716.0789999999997
were they like super intolerant toward

2714.88 --> 2718.079
gay

2716.079 --> 2720.6400000000003
or they were just like fine whatever but

2718.079 --> 2722.6400000000003
you're not gonna get kids that way

2720.64 --> 2725.44
i don't know i don't know all the

2722.64 --> 2727.92
details of old viking culture

2725.44 --> 2731.119
but i wouldn't be surprised if they were

2727.92 --> 2733.599
right back then super tolerant as well

2731.119 --> 2736.4
which would be considered like blasphemy

2733.599 --> 2739.119
and all that like evil

2736.4 --> 2741.44
by other cultures of the time so maybe

2739.119 --> 2744.2400000000002
they were always leftist have you ever

2741.44 --> 2744.2400000000002
thought about that

2745.119 --> 2749.839
it's just that leftist now means

2747.839 --> 2752.839
freaking demonically possessed insane

2749.839 --> 2752.839
people

2763.68 --> 2767.2
ah hello mike's didn't well

2767.68 --> 2770.56
oh you're in the hospital

2769.28 --> 2772.4
hmm

2770.56 --> 2774.72
okay well i took your wrench away

2772.4 --> 2777.599
because yeah you would like deleted

2774.72 --> 2780.8799999999997
three messages for no reason

2777.599 --> 2780.88
so whatever is going on

2782.079 --> 2785.8
it's already resolved

2802.4 --> 2807.2000000000003
you actually think vikings were gay

2804.319 --> 2810.72
friendly no i don't think so i'm asking

2807.2 --> 2810.72
bad karma i'm asking

2811.92 --> 2818.16
you get it i'm asking

2815.359 --> 2818.16
i'm not saying

2818.24 --> 2822.64
it kill everybody in their path

2822.96 --> 2829.359
okay what does that have to do with

2825.52 --> 2831.28
whether they tolerated gay or not right

2829.359 --> 2834.0
what if they had like

2831.28 --> 2836.8
people in their tribe

2834.0 --> 2839.599
that turned out to be kind of gay

2836.8 --> 2841.599
would they then freaking kill him

2839.599 --> 2843.6800000000003
would they

2841.599 --> 2846.079
or would they be like okay he's kind of

2843.68 --> 2846.8799999999997
like [ __ ] or something and just kind

2846.079 --> 2848.6400000000003
of

2846.88 --> 2850.559
like yeah you go live your life there

2848.64 --> 2853.839
we're gonna crush

2850.559 --> 2856.559
right that's the question

2853.839 --> 2858.88
not whether they were merciful towards

2856.559 --> 2862.079
their opponents that has nothing to do

2858.88 --> 2862.079
with that at all

2871.52 --> 2878.319
they would have sacrificed really what's

2874.96 --> 2879.28
your evidence for that bad karma

2878.319 --> 2881.2799999999997
yeah

2879.28 --> 2884.2400000000002
like what the [ __ ] is that [ __ ] i've

2881.28 --> 2886.96
never even heard of like sacrif like

2884.24 --> 2889.7599999999998
involuntary sacrifice what the [ __ ] are

2886.96 --> 2889.76
you talking about

2891.52 --> 2894.96
do you really know what you're talking

2893.119 --> 2897.359
about

2894.96 --> 2898.839
or you've been

2897.359 --> 2902.16
tainted by

2898.839 --> 2904.96
modernized fantastical

2902.16 --> 2906.48
variations on the idea what vikings were

2904.96 --> 2908.7200000000003
like do you actually know what you're

2906.48 --> 2912.48
talking about that's why i'm asking i'm

2908.72 --> 2912.48
not stating i'm asking

2912.88 --> 2918.96
right i've never heard of this

2916.48 --> 2922.079
sacrificing

2918.96 --> 2925.119
somebody to the gods

2922.079 --> 2928.1600000000003
because they are an offense

2925.119 --> 2931.599
seriously i've never heard of that

2928.16 --> 2931.5989999999997
you have any reference for that

2939.52 --> 2943.04
viking wandering around with the rainbow

2941.359 --> 2945.2
no but that's ridiculous

2943.04 --> 2947.68
that's not what i was saying

2945.2 --> 2948.96
i'm not talking about demonically

2947.68 --> 2952.0
possessed

2948.96 --> 2955.28
vikings like leftists now i'm talking

2952.0 --> 2958.48
about them actually being kinda tolerant

2955.28 --> 2960.4
compared to other people of that time

2958.48 --> 2965.44
that's what i'm saying that would make

2960.4 --> 2969.48
them leftists leftist then not now

2965.44 --> 2969.48
stop mixing it up

2971.44 --> 2974.88
so yeah does anybody know how to answer

2973.44 --> 2976.88
the question

2974.88 --> 2980.1600000000003
were they tolerant

2976.88 --> 2982.1600000000003
towards like gay family members they

2980.16 --> 2983.839
didn't just outright execute them in the

2982.16 --> 2986.16
streets or something or throw them off a

2983.839 --> 2987.839
building as they do in

2986.16 --> 2989.2
some other regions of the world as you

2987.839 --> 2990.0789999999997
know right

2989.2 --> 2990.96
that's

2990.079 --> 2992.1600000000003
the

2990.96 --> 2995.2
question

2992.16 --> 2996.5589999999997
that is the question that is the

2995.2 --> 2998.8799999999997
question

2996.559 --> 3002.0
don't want to know about your fantasies

2998.88 --> 3004.48
projections of current day leftists on

3002.0 --> 3008.24
vikings of old that's not what i need

3004.48 --> 3009.839
you to do i need you to answer

3008.24 --> 3012.5589999999997
the questions

3009.839 --> 3015.52
that would reveal the detail

3012.559 --> 3018.0
of their inner culture how they dealt

3015.52 --> 3021.44
with things in order to establish

3018.0 --> 3022.559
whether they were hardcore right

3021.44 --> 3025.04
then

3022.559 --> 3029.0400000000004
or kind of leftist

3025.04 --> 3029.04
even back then that's my question

3035.04 --> 3041.079
hmm right yes woodworking going there

3037.359 --> 3041.0789999999997
yeah they had many tricks

3041.599 --> 3045.3590000000004
they had many tricks for their

3042.96 --> 3047.68
navigation they were like very

3045.359 --> 3050.7999999999997
broad in their navigation ability which

3047.68 --> 3052.839
is brilliant because like yeah

3050.8 --> 3056.4
if you just have like one

3052.839 --> 3058.64
navigator like one guy that can do it

3056.4 --> 3060.48
then yeah he gets killed and everybody's

3058.64 --> 3062.7999999999997
lost at c and they're all gonna die

3060.48 --> 3066.0
right but if seriously almost everybody

3062.8 --> 3068.7200000000003
has an x that can double as a navigation

3066.0 --> 3071.2
tool then you basically only need one or

3068.72 --> 3073.359
a few guys to survive and they can still

3071.2 --> 3076.24
find their way it's brilliant it's

3073.359 --> 3076.24
really dynamic

3076.64 --> 3081.2
right because yeah

3078.559 --> 3085.3590000000004
everybody has an x so they might as well

3081.2 --> 3085.359
double as a navigation tool brilliant

3089.2 --> 3093.5989999999997
so yeah anybody does anybody know

3093.76 --> 3100.48
to answer my intricate question about

3097.2 --> 3102.0
vikings of old and how they dealt

3100.48 --> 3104.64
with people

3102.0 --> 3107.359
that turned out to be gay in their

3104.64 --> 3109.2
tribes specifically not outsiders they

3107.359 --> 3112.0789999999997
didn't give a [ __ ]

3109.2 --> 3113.9199999999996
inside that's my question

3112.079 --> 3116.6400000000003
does anybody know

3113.92 --> 3119.119
does anybody know does anybody know

3116.64 --> 3123.319
that's the question not other blabber

3119.119 --> 3123.319
things that question

3129.359 --> 3134.7999999999997
yeah fondo dando yeah

3132.079 --> 3134.8
that's not

3135.04 --> 3139.7599999999998
yeah that's for you to find out and for

3137.04 --> 3141.7599999999998
the vikings of all to know i don't even

3139.76 --> 3145.0400000000004
know i've heard that that's the case

3141.76 --> 3146.6400000000003
that's it that's all

3145.04 --> 3150.0
i've not

3146.64 --> 3153.44
learned all the details but apparently

3150.0 --> 3155.839
vikings lu used a lot of navigation

3153.44 --> 3158.8
tools

3155.839 --> 3160.64
like in their common tools like an axe

3158.8 --> 3162.6400000000003
and every like all warriors had to have

3160.64 --> 3164.48
an x or something

3162.64 --> 3166.7999999999997
and then they just

3164.48 --> 3169.2
yeah doubled as navigation tools is

3166.8 --> 3169.2000000000003
brilliant

3172.559 --> 3176.1600000000003
i don't know

3174.16 --> 3180.1189999999997
i don't know okay right okay well i

3176.16 --> 3180.1189999999997
guess we'll never know then

3188.079 --> 3192.0
right

3188.96 --> 3194.559
but when i go by my intuition and my

3192.0 --> 3196.72
knowledge of like inner

3194.559 --> 3200.079
genetic tendencies

3196.72 --> 3202.64
if they're gonna be super tolerant now

3200.079 --> 3205.04
then they were probably super tolerant

3202.64 --> 3207.44
thousands of years ago

3205.04 --> 3210.96
is that really super unreasonable and

3207.44 --> 3210.96
tolerant towards their own right

3211.2 --> 3214.8799999999997
because yeah they were not tolerance

3212.88 --> 3216.6400000000003
towards who they were invading they

3214.88 --> 3218.6400000000003
didn't give a [ __ ] just kill them all

3216.64 --> 3221.2
like oh you can't defend yourself well

3218.64 --> 3223.92
then you're not supposed to live die

3221.2 --> 3225.9199999999996
right but that's not

3223.92 --> 3229.119
what the question is about question is

3225.92 --> 3232.559
out like how do they deal

3229.119 --> 3235.2000000000003
with people in their tribes

3232.559 --> 3237.8390000000004
in their tribes how do they deal with

3235.2 --> 3239.7599999999998
them were they tolerant to like really

3237.839 --> 3242.5589999999997
different looking people like maybe they

3239.76 --> 3242.559
had some like

3242.8 --> 3246.7200000000003
i don't know

3244.48 --> 3248.319
like a couple of mongolian types even

3246.72 --> 3250.3999999999996
among them

3248.319 --> 3251.839
maybe they were very tolerant even back

3250.4 --> 3253.92
then

3251.839 --> 3256.48
were they or were they like oh you don't

3253.92 --> 3258.079
look like us i kill him

3256.48 --> 3261.599
i don't think so

3258.079 --> 3264.6400000000003
right and it's like oh oh damn it

3261.599 --> 3266.48
one of the kids turns out to be gay

3264.64 --> 3268.72
damn it

3266.48 --> 3270.64
okay just let him take care of the

3268.72 --> 3273.5989999999997
stables

3270.64 --> 3276.319
right something like that

3273.599 --> 3278.799
like what they just drag him out like oh

3276.319 --> 3281.52
how dare you you're gay you're gonna die

3278.799 --> 3285.28
it's an atrocity no i just don't see it

3281.52 --> 3286.88
i don't see that i can't imagine it

3285.28 --> 3288.88
basically

3286.88 --> 3290.1600000000003
but i might be wrong so that's why i'm

3288.88 --> 3293.359
asking

3290.16 --> 3296.0
is there any hint about this is there

3293.359 --> 3298.48
any verbal tradition any

3296.0 --> 3301.52
viking story

3298.48 --> 3303.44
thing that literally says like

3301.52 --> 3306.559
no you must

3303.44 --> 3308.96
if one in your tribe turns out to be

3306.559 --> 3311.119
gay or something you have to kill them

3308.96 --> 3314.7200000000003
like is there

3311.119 --> 3316.6400000000003
actual written references to any of that

3314.72 --> 3320.0789999999997
any of that

3316.64 --> 3323.04
any at all

3320.079 --> 3323.04
that's my question

3329.2 --> 3333.4399999999996
because from everything i've learned

3330.96 --> 3336.64
with vikings most is just focused on

3333.44 --> 3337.44
like how do you deal with enemies

3336.64 --> 3340.8799999999997
like

3337.44 --> 3343.359
not people in your tribe not family

3340.88 --> 3345.76
i don't know

3343.359 --> 3348.0
on the top of my mind any references on

3345.76 --> 3350.079
how you should literally deal with your

3348.0 --> 3353.04
family members directly there might be

3350.079 --> 3353.04
some out there but

3357.119 --> 3360.559
hacker this horribles

3361.04 --> 3367.7599999999998
son hamlet seemed kinda gay

3365.44 --> 3367.76
sure

3372.559 --> 3377.0
i was fighting between tribes

3378.0 --> 3381.04
right

3378.88 --> 3382.96
and that then eventually the fighting

3381.04 --> 3385.04
just turned into like

3382.96 --> 3388.2
sparring contests that would might get a

3385.04 --> 3388.2
little bloody

3391.92 --> 3397.04
right so they had basically a brawler

3394.559 --> 3397.0400000000004
culture

3397.2 --> 3402.319
well that doesn't automatically tell you

3400.48 --> 3405.2
whether they would tolerate people that

3402.319 --> 3407.599
are gay or not right they're not just

3405.2 --> 3409.9199999999996
gonna kill off somebody because they're

3407.599 --> 3412.48
like physically weaker if they're very

3409.92 --> 3416.319
smart or very helpful or very good for

3412.48 --> 3416.319
morale with words right

3416.559 --> 3421.44
nobody kills the cook for example

3419.2 --> 3421.4399999999996
right

3424.48 --> 3429.52
like unless the cook is just a really

3426.96 --> 3433.559
nasty person and he like poisons people

3429.52 --> 3433.559
then you would kill the cook

3443.76 --> 3448.6400000000003
sure you are a psychics traveler you

3446.4 --> 3451.64
should cut down on the psychedelics

3448.64 --> 3451.64
probably

3464.96 --> 3469.44
right tolerant not cocked

3467.52 --> 3471.359
right but think about it tolerant not

3469.44 --> 3472.839
cocked

3471.359 --> 3475.68
that's really what

3472.839 --> 3478.64
original left wing

3475.68 --> 3480.72
is isn't it

3478.64 --> 3483.52
it's just the tolerant tolerant but

3480.72 --> 3483.52
still worthy

3483.839 --> 3487.16
and good

3501.119 --> 3507.599
it's all pictures so red is the wrong

3502.96 --> 3507.599
word okay fine depictions then

3510.96 --> 3516.88
you never heard the word gay until i

3513.119 --> 3521.079
found out who george michael was

3516.88 --> 3521.079
oh dear oh dear my dear

3531.839 --> 3534.5589999999997
not really

3541.28 --> 3544.28
what

3546.079 --> 3550.079
oh george michael ward george

3551.2 --> 3555.2799999999997
right

3552.88 --> 3557.839
just like jim bob

3555.28 --> 3559.599
he refuses to be shamed about his george

3557.839 --> 3561.68
wearing her habits

3559.599 --> 3563.52
and yeah don't blame if he really likes

3561.68 --> 3567.72
wearing those then he should absolutely

3563.52 --> 3567.72
do it against all odds

3575.04 --> 3581.2
there was no time to be gay back then

3578.4 --> 3582.2400000000002
that's not true

3581.2 --> 3584.24
i mean

3582.24 --> 3587.799
i'm pretty sure vikings did a lot of

3584.24 --> 3587.799
raping too

3588.24 --> 3592.4799999999996
and yeah if you were into

3591.2 --> 3595.4399999999996
guys

3592.48 --> 3597.76
then who like what

3595.44 --> 3599.2000000000003
your brothers are gonna stop you from

3597.76 --> 3601.3590000000004
raping guys

3599.2 --> 3603.839
right

3601.359 --> 3606.48
i know it sounds really disgusting yeah

3603.839 --> 3609.52
the vikings were really brutal

3606.48 --> 3610.4
towards their opponents

3609.52 --> 3612.799
but

3610.4 --> 3612.799
i'm just

3613.119 --> 3618.7200000000003
i think i made my point and now you can

3615.68 --> 3618.72
all think about it

3619.04 --> 3622.88
because it doesn't seem like anybody has

3621.2 --> 3624.64
an answer here

3622.88 --> 3626.48
a lot of watches took place just like

3624.64 --> 3629.2799999999997
the roman really

3626.48 --> 3632.16
did they though gadget inspector are you

3629.28 --> 3632.1600000000003
sure about that

3633.44 --> 3637.28
i don't know

3634.96 --> 3637.28
maybe

3638.24 --> 3642.68
all right but the romans were like

3642.799 --> 3646.64
like romans were genuinely right-wing in

3645.359 --> 3650.319
many ways

3646.64 --> 3650.319
and they did like gay stuff

3651.2 --> 3657.319
i don't know i'm not gonna get into that

3653.28 --> 3657.3190000000004
but they were very different

3660.88 --> 3664.4
adam turned out to be gay

3665.2 --> 3668.64
for eve

3666.96 --> 3670.64
yeah okay let's let's double down on

3668.64 --> 3673.5989999999997
that joke what about poor adam i mean

3670.64 --> 3674.96
he's the only man in the world

3673.599 --> 3678.1600000000003
and he's gay

3674.96 --> 3678.16
and adam is a woman

3681.119 --> 3685.839
it's ridiculous

3682.64 --> 3685.839
forget about it

3697.2 --> 3700.799
yeah wouldn't that be screwed up

3702.16 --> 3704.5589999999997
anyway

3705.52 --> 3709.92
the berserkers probably did some creepy

3707.68 --> 3711.9199999999996
guys well the berserkers

3709.92 --> 3714.079
did mushrooms right and when you go

3711.92 --> 3717.44
berserk

3714.079 --> 3719.3590000000004
and you during berserking also rape you

3717.44 --> 3722.319
you don't give they will probably like

3719.359 --> 3724.839
even like just rape cattle and [ __ ]

3722.319 --> 3726.88
whatever get in front of them i don't

3724.839 --> 3728.24
know right

3726.88 --> 3730.88
berserking

3728.24 --> 3733.4399999999996
is quite insane

3730.88 --> 3733.44
literally

3735.68 --> 3737.9199999999996
berserker

3737.039 --> 3741.3190000000004
were

3737.92 --> 3741.319
down syndrome

3741.599 --> 3747.92
i've never heard of actual down syndrome

3744.96 --> 3747.92
among vikings

3750.16 --> 3755.0389999999998
i don't know about that clutch

3752.319 --> 3757.839
i'm pretty sure the berserkers literally

3755.039 --> 3757.8390000000004
ate shrooms

3757.92 --> 3763.28
are you saying that they were that's

3760.079 --> 3765.8390000000004
really weird facial formulas

3763.28 --> 3768.1600000000003
that's a really weird facial

3765.839 --> 3770.64
but maybe maybe maybe there's something

3768.16 --> 3770.64
to that

3774.72 --> 3779.72
it wasn't owen yeah i remember clutch

3784.96 --> 3790.079
all right roman empire

3787.2 --> 3793.2
fell due to gayness it's kind of like

3790.079 --> 3795.92
the american right wing right

3793.2 --> 3798.5589999999997
because the roman empire was like really

3795.92 --> 3800.7200000000003
militant and corporate and like

3798.559 --> 3803.44
no screwing around and then they started

3800.72 --> 3805.9199999999996
to become super gay and more gay and

3803.44 --> 3808.64
more gay and insane

3805.92 --> 3811.839
and completely losing track of reality

3808.64 --> 3811.839
and then they got killed

3818.72 --> 3825.2
but i'll bet you they started out really

3821.2 --> 3827.5989999999997
sharp minded witty creative

3825.2 --> 3827.5989999999997
driven

3827.92 --> 3835.6800000000003
like with a lot of hunger to procreate

3832.24 --> 3835.68
make families and all that

3836.16 --> 3842.16
that's how it started and then yeah over

3839.68 --> 3845.8799999999997
time it just became more and more gay

3842.16 --> 3845.8799999999997
and mentally deranged

3854.079 --> 3857.599
right but it's so it's how it always

3855.839 --> 3858.72
starts right

3857.599 --> 3860.88
gay

3858.72 --> 3863.2799999999997
starts to become accepted

3860.88 --> 3865.6800000000003
in defiance

3863.28 --> 3867.8390000000004
it's because of arrogance every single

3865.68 --> 3869.1189999999997
time every

3867.839 --> 3870.64
single

3869.119 --> 3874.319
time

3870.64 --> 3877.52
that gayness becomes publicly accepted

3874.319 --> 3882.4
it's always out of arrogance

3877.52 --> 3882.4
in defiance of nature and the gods

3884.4 --> 3889.76
always it's like oh we think we can get

3886.64 --> 3893.1189999999997
away with it look at history every part

3889.76 --> 3895.28
it's always the same always

3893.119 --> 3896.6400000000003
always the same

3895.28 --> 3898.1600000000003
arrogance

3896.64 --> 3900.799
thinking you can get away with it

3898.16 --> 3902.3999999999996
normalization because we are the most

3900.799 --> 3904.72
powerful

3902.4 --> 3905.839
we don't need to follow god's rules

3904.72 --> 3908.64
anymore

3905.839 --> 3910.88
you want to be gay you can be gay

3908.64 --> 3915.72
yeah that's how it starts every single

3910.88 --> 3915.7200000000003
time and then it goes to [ __ ]

3922.48 --> 3925.48
um

3941.44 --> 3946.16
most of romans were educated well a lot

3943.599 --> 3950.2400000000002
of people were educated in egypt at the

3946.16 --> 3953.68
time seeking stuff egypt was like a

3950.24 --> 3957.9199999999996
was like the the capital of knowledge

3953.68 --> 3957.9199999999996
in the entire wide region back then

3958.799 --> 3966.0
like that's where you got to study

3963.039 --> 3967.2000000000003
like real

3966.0 --> 3969.76
real stuff

3967.2 --> 3969.7599999999998
lots of it

3973.44 --> 3979.839
like it was the studying capital of the

3975.92 --> 3979.839
world at the time egypt

4004.0 --> 4009.44
a thousand years of history messed up

4006.799 --> 4011.92
yeah but there's a lot of difficulties

4009.44 --> 4014.7200000000003
as to how it all transpired it might be

4011.92 --> 4016.0
that indeed there's just

4014.72 --> 4018.24
the entire

4016.0 --> 4020.559
situations of what has happened has been

4018.24 --> 4024.319
pulled apart a thousand years and then

4020.559 --> 4027.44
like vaguely fill in

4024.319 --> 4027.44
so yeah there might

4028.48 --> 4034.96
as in

4030.88 --> 4037.6800000000003
it could be that jesus actually existed

4034.96 --> 4038.7200000000003
a thousand years ago not 2 000.

4037.68 --> 4041.2799999999997
yeah

4038.72 --> 4043.52
there's a lot a lot of indications for

4041.28 --> 4043.52
this

4045.2 --> 4049.4399999999996
somewhere in that there was was it 500

4047.599 --> 4051.599
years i think it's roughly a thousand

4049.44 --> 4054.2400000000002
years but yeah that's

4051.599 --> 4057.839
like you can literally just

4054.24 --> 4060.4799999999996
undo the time gap and then literally see

4057.839 --> 4062.88
how historically historical details

4060.48 --> 4065.44
suddenly start to fit

4062.88 --> 4068.319
like symmetrically suddenly you're able

4065.44 --> 4070.079
to identify something that just happened

4068.319 --> 4071.599
in this story

4070.079 --> 4073.2000000000003
and it's not really told like what

4071.599 --> 4074.88
that's about

4073.2 --> 4077.52
and then in another story which

4074.88 --> 4079.6800000000003
supposedly is a completely different era

4077.52 --> 4082.0
they're doing something

4079.68 --> 4084.799
but there's no trace of it historically

4082.0 --> 4086.799
and then you'd like oh oh guess what the

4084.799 --> 4089.28
ones they were talking about was

4086.799 --> 4091.52
actually the other person

4089.28 --> 4093.76
in the other story supposedly a thousand

4091.52 --> 4097.04
years before that right and so

4093.76 --> 4098.96
you can re-merge

4097.04 --> 4101.359
history

4098.96 --> 4103.199
if you know what you're doing

4101.359 --> 4105.839
and there's people doing that's very

4103.199 --> 4108.239
interesting adam meekin is spending lots

4105.839 --> 4109.759
of energy on that too and very

4108.239 --> 4112.759
fascinating hearing him out about the

4109.759 --> 4112.759
details

4118.08 --> 4121.92
but it's still a work in progress

4119.839 --> 4123.2789999999995
because it's just

4121.92 --> 4125.6
big

4123.279 --> 4128.799000000001
complicated

4125.6 --> 4131.120000000001
it changes everything like really big

4128.799 --> 4131.12
time

4131.44 --> 4136.159
like the consequences of things are just

4133.679 --> 4136.159
different

4137.12 --> 4141.679
because the context

4139.12 --> 4143.2789999999995
was the thing that was most

4141.679 --> 4145.04
soothed

4143.279 --> 4146.64
smoothed out

4145.04 --> 4149.199
d ruffled

4146.64 --> 4151.679
because of the split apart it was really

4149.199 --> 4155.04
to give it all cover

4151.679 --> 4156.64
to kind of start anew right that's why

4155.04 --> 4159.6
you do that that's why you change

4156.64 --> 4163.12
history to be able to start with an

4159.6 --> 4163.120000000001
apparent clean slate

4163.92 --> 4169.1990000000005
but because of that much later when

4166.319 --> 4171.839000000001
that's not so much a direct priority

4169.199 --> 4173.839
people will notice like wait but

4171.839 --> 4176.719
these things just don't really match

4173.839 --> 4178.719
like how can this have happened exactly

4176.719 --> 4180.96
like it's described in another story

4178.719 --> 4183.12
that's like hundreds of years later

4180.96 --> 4185.6
like that doesn't make sense

4183.12 --> 4189.4
until you re-merge them and then

4185.6 --> 4189.400000000001
suddenly things fit

4196.719 --> 4201.92
whoa statue of liberty is a recreation

4199.36 --> 4204.239
of the colossus of rhodes fascinating

4201.92 --> 4208.08
idea i don't know if that's really true

4204.239 --> 4208.08
though but it's a fascinating idea

4208.96 --> 4213.04
i mean i think the colossus of rhodes

4210.8 --> 4216.4800000000005
was not a female though

4213.04 --> 4218.159
not that statue of liberty is a female

4216.48 --> 4220.32
i mean it's supposed to represent the

4218.159 --> 4223.12
female but this i think that the

4220.32 --> 4226.239
colossal rhodes was not representative

4223.12 --> 4229.04
of female attire and all that

4226.239 --> 4233.12
so i'm not entirely sure

4229.04 --> 4233.12
you're correct there slow mo moon buggy

4237.92 --> 4241.52
julius caesar and jesus christ same beat

4240.08 --> 4242.48
no

4241.52 --> 4244.400000000001
no

4242.48 --> 4247.36
absolutely not

4244.4 --> 4247.36
absolutely not

4248.159 --> 4250.32
no

4251.44 --> 4255.5199999999995
the

4252.239 --> 4257.678999999999
none of that even like no

4255.52 --> 4260.080000000001
no it's different

4257.679 --> 4263.1990000000005
there's actually a different perspe well

4260.08 --> 4264.96
maybe no but not the same person right

4263.199 --> 4268.48
but there's

4264.96 --> 4271.44
lots of suspicion that jesus was

4268.48 --> 4274.639999999999
actually like descendant

4271.44 --> 4274.639999999999
from cleopatra

4278.56 --> 4282.0
right

4280.159 --> 4284.48
that

4282.0 --> 4286.719
and yeah cleopatra

4284.48 --> 4290.239
and you know

4286.719 --> 4293.04
caesar right they even historically have

4290.239 --> 4295.28
like very significant involvement

4293.04 --> 4295.28
but

4296.56 --> 4302.719
they're not the same

4298.96 --> 4306.56
no there's no way absolutely not

4302.719 --> 4309.84
jesus was never an emperor of rome ever

4306.56 --> 4312.4800000000005
ever ever ever never

4309.84 --> 4314.96
that makes absolutely no sense now

4312.48 --> 4316.5599999999995
i've heard

4314.96 --> 4319.199
that he was

4316.56 --> 4321.679
rather like a descendant from

4319.199 --> 4324.08
well egyptian nobility and that he

4321.679 --> 4327.1990000000005
basically was given

4324.08 --> 4330.08
control over a region

4327.199 --> 4332.5599999999995
right in between

4330.08 --> 4334.719
the roman empire

4332.56 --> 4335.76
which also kind of included egypt at the

4334.719 --> 4338.8
time

4335.76 --> 4339.84
and the persian empire

4338.8 --> 4342.719
called

4339.84 --> 4342.719
oh where was it again

4353.679 --> 4359.1990000000005
julius caesar died

4355.6 --> 4359.1990000000005
yeah sure logical conclusion

4360.239 --> 4366.08
there's no way julius caesar was jesus

4363.04 --> 4370.92
christ no way ever it's never going to

4366.08 --> 4370.92
turn out to be that absolutely never

4373.04 --> 4379.84
like no matter how you rearrange history

4376.0 --> 4382.96
that's never going to be what it is ever

4379.84 --> 4384.4800000000005
does absolutely no match whatsoever

4382.96 --> 4386.32
but

4384.48 --> 4391.48
what's that region called again adam

4386.32 --> 4391.48
meekin why aren't you in my chat dammit

4398.159 --> 4404.159
we discussed this yesterday why am i

4400.08 --> 4404.159
forgetting the name freaking hell

4404.32 --> 4409.92
it's a it's a region kind of like where

4406.719 --> 4413.6
syria is right now

4409.92 --> 4415.1990000000005
and there is suspicion that

4413.6 --> 4418.400000000001
christ

4415.199 --> 4421.04
was actually king of that region

4418.4 --> 4424.239
like actually king not mesopotamia no no

4421.04 --> 4424.239
that's way before that

4430.719 --> 4434.159
free

4432.159 --> 4437.44
no not if it doesn't even sound like

4434.159 --> 4441.839999999999
that at all not mesopotamia not lebanon

4437.44 --> 4441.839999999999
no no no no

4442.4 --> 4446.239
jesus what the hell's going on with

4443.84 --> 4446.2390000000005
skype

4447.52 --> 4453.4800000000005
i don't know how to look it up like when

4449.6 --> 4453.4800000000005
you look it up you're good

4454.08 --> 4458.5599999999995
i just i have it like on the top of my

4456.4 --> 4460.879999999999
mind but i can't really

4458.56 --> 4463.92
see it i know where it is i don't know

4460.88 --> 4466.32
what it's called again it's

4463.92 --> 4471.28
adam

4466.32 --> 4471.28
how dare you not be in my chat damn it

4474.239 --> 4477.12
not as syria

4478.32 --> 4483.84
not k9 no

4480.64 --> 4483.84
not a america no

4490.32 --> 4494.48
i can't know

4491.76 --> 4498.320000000001
i can describe it perhaps maybe somebody

4494.48 --> 4499.199
is historically apt enough to know

4498.32 --> 4500.639999999999
so

4499.199 --> 4504.239
crusades

4500.64 --> 4507.12
right the crusades european crusades to

4504.239 --> 4510.799999999999
take back the holy land

4507.12 --> 4512.48
what city did they go for first

4510.8 --> 4514.64
not jerusalem

4512.48 --> 4516.159
it was another place

4514.64 --> 4518.2390000000005
the other place

4516.159 --> 4521.679
what's the name of the other place where

4518.239 --> 4523.28
the crusades went to conquer first

4521.679 --> 4525.84
officially

4523.28 --> 4525.84
that's the place

4526.08 --> 4530.239
that's actually christ's kingdom

4532.08 --> 4535.04
what's it called again
