92.4 --> 97.119
in a chat of a stream that i can't start

94.72 --> 99.67999999999999
up it's kind of ridiculous

hope people will find the chat

117.6 --> 123.439
yeah there's been a lot more clouds it

119.92 --> 127.119
was kind of a nice and fresh morning

123.439 --> 127.439
i had a very long sleep also it was a

127.119 --> 130.479
bit

127.439 --> 131.92
late last night so i'm glad that i was

130.479 --> 134.72000000000003
able to

131.92 --> 137.11999999999998
not get cooked out of my bed in the

134.72 --> 137.12
morning

139.76 --> 143.599
but yeah still very nice it's moist

142.16 --> 146.4
though it's very moist

143.599 --> 146.79999999999998
yeah you can see it lack of air clarity

146.4 --> 150.48000000000002
even

146.8 --> 150.48000000000002
close by is kind of misty

151.65 --> 158.8
[Music]

153.84 --> 158.8
all right so i

159.12 --> 164.99
got some lemon juice with honey again

163.28 --> 166.56
and water

164.99 --> 169.59900000000002
[Music]

and some of that green tea

169.599 --> 174.07999999999998
that i still have left that's it

183.04 --> 186.959
yes dank i know

184.12 --> 188.56
[Music]

186.959 --> 193.12
i don't know what to do about it right

188.56 --> 196.0
now i hope i can figure it out in the

193.12 --> 197.92000000000002
in the coming week so that i can have

196.0 --> 199.76
like the original setup but it's a

197.92 --> 202.23899999999998
little difficult

199.76 --> 203.04
and with this heat it doesn't really

202.239 --> 205.20000000000002
help me

203.04 --> 207.67999999999998
because just hard to focus on these kind

205.2 --> 211.599
of annoying little things

207.68 --> 214.72
uh anyway let's see who's in chat so far

211.599 --> 218.0
michael o'rourke was first good servant

214.72 --> 222.08
eyes wide shot dank

218.0 --> 226.4
ajm martin tolberg

222.08 --> 229.92000000000002
yeah good to see you all

226.4 --> 232.0
i hope more will find the stream

229.92 --> 234.07999999999998
because yeah i can only find it myself

232.0 --> 234.879
after i've gone live and then i go to my

234.08 --> 237.68
videos

234.879 --> 239.35999999999999
and then i can see myself live there

237.68 --> 241.12
it's the only way

239.36 --> 244.56
because indeed you don't see it anymore

241.12 --> 244.56
on my front page it's

245.2 --> 253.11999999999998
quite annoying anyway

248.799 --> 253.12
so saturday

253.76 --> 257.359
so yeah again at least one half hour

256.32 --> 259.28
show

257.359 --> 261.28
and yesterday the flash the base was

259.28 --> 262.479
back and yeah it was very nice to be

261.28 --> 264.88
back

262.479 --> 265.75899999999996
it was nice to basically sit back for a

264.88 --> 269.36
bit

265.759 --> 271.52000000000004
because it was just incredibly hot

269.36 --> 273.12
as you noticed even like during my show

271.52 --> 276.24
yesterday

273.12 --> 277.84000000000003
so it's good to not just be on camera

276.24 --> 282.56
because that's different when it's very

277.84 --> 286.0
hot and i'm kind of on camera

282.56 --> 289.52
yeah that's a little bit more difficult

286.0 --> 289.52
uh anyway

290.96 --> 293.19899999999996
uh

295.52 --> 300.56
let's see i did make some notes

302.4 --> 304.71999999999997
right

306.8 --> 314.08
yeah yeah big bear was also live again

311.039 --> 316.0
and now we're talking about yeah gammas

314.08 --> 319.59999999999997
a lot and about

316.0 --> 324.639
just that frequency

319.6 --> 327.12
the bankers and the the antifa people

324.639 --> 328.16
and how they're kind of like resonating

327.12 --> 331.36
even though they're

328.16 --> 333.52000000000004
kind of opposites really

331.36 --> 334.96000000000004
and yeah it was pretty interesting

333.52 --> 338.79999999999995
stream

334.96 --> 339.12
oh yeah and on netflix i watched karate

338.8 --> 342.96000000000004
kid

339.12 --> 346.0
it's a long time ago wax on wax off

342.96 --> 349.12
but yeah there's some weird

346.0 --> 353.84
little things in that movie but it's

349.12 --> 353.84000000000003
also interesting

355.52 --> 359.59999999999997
i think karate kid was probably yeah i

357.919 --> 360.639
think that when i was young and i

359.6 --> 362.8
watched the movie i

360.639 --> 364.08
also had issues with getting bullied

362.8 --> 366.919
although they weren't so

364.08 --> 370.0
physical with me you know was more like

366.919 --> 373.59999999999997
ostracization and

370.0 --> 375.12
psychological but yeah when i first saw

373.6 --> 376.47900000000004
that movie it definitely

375.12 --> 378.16
encouraged me and i think that my

376.479 --> 381.59999999999997
parents even meant to do that

378.16 --> 384.88000000000005
encouraged me to go into into karate at

381.6 --> 386.96000000000004
first but i didn't really like karate

384.88 --> 388.56
oh no wait i actually started out with

386.96 --> 390.79999999999995
judo

388.56 --> 392.0
i never really did karate i don't know

390.8 --> 395.36
why

392.0 --> 397.52
but then i yeah changed that

395.36 --> 398.88
because the atmosphere wasn't too great

397.52 --> 402.71999999999997
there

398.88 --> 402.71999999999997
and i changed it to taekwondo

404.16 --> 408.08000000000004
but yeah it's interesting to see that

405.84 --> 408.08
back

411.199 --> 418.0
was daniel the real bully in movie one

415.68 --> 418.0
what

419.12 --> 423.84000000000003
why are you saying that

425.759 --> 430.96000000000004
no i don't think so although he is kind

428.479 --> 434.0
of like a

430.96 --> 437.12
an a bit of an in-your-face kind of guy

434.0 --> 441.28
as a teenager

437.12 --> 441.28000000000003
so but not a bully not at all

448.08 --> 452.24
your female eyes white shirt okay good

450.319 --> 455.84000000000003
to know i

452.24 --> 459.68
i hadn't considered that

455.84 --> 462.88
right anyway after that uh

459.68 --> 465.52
i watched iron works again

462.88 --> 467.12
so yeah and we got the the morning show

465.52 --> 468.24
and i got the evening show pretty much

467.12 --> 470.96
from the start

468.24 --> 473.199
it was pretty good although they did

470.96 --> 475.84
have a guest on that was seemed to be

473.199 --> 480.08000000000004
kind of a bit of a blabberer

475.84 --> 481.84
and he i wonder if they noticed that i

480.08 --> 483.35999999999996
probably think they did also because i

481.84 --> 485.84
put it in chat and the guy was

483.36 --> 488.40000000000003
responding to me in chat too

485.84 --> 491.11999999999995
but he was basically bringing out like

488.4 --> 492.79999999999995
technobabble explanations and ether

491.12 --> 495.599
and then say oh yeah it's always

492.8 --> 495.599
accepted and

499.039 --> 502.4
even brought in that that guy brought in

502.0 --> 506.08
that

502.4 --> 508.87899999999996
like oh yeah water it doesn't turn

506.08 --> 510.87899999999996
into the gases they say and there's

508.879 --> 512.399
something with the salt and i corrected

510.879 --> 514.88
that all in chat because it was

512.399 --> 517.2
basically the standard bs

514.88 --> 518.8
we got from pete and peter or whatever

517.2 --> 521.279
their name is and

518.8 --> 522.159
from that direction and that guy seemed

521.279 --> 526.08
to be very much

522.159 --> 526.08
in it but it's just like oh god

527.68 --> 532.7199999999999
and he was actually addressing me like

529.44 --> 536.0
oh you i got all these links and

532.72 --> 538.399
all these crafts and i'm like no

536.0 --> 538.399
no

540.08 --> 544.24
but yeah other than that it was a pretty

541.839 --> 548.72
good show and yeah

544.24 --> 551.12
uh besides that i just did a bunch of

548.72 --> 551.12
games

552.24 --> 557.519
have not continued mandalorian or dc

555.44 --> 563.839
legends or anything didn't get to that

557.519 --> 563.839
it was late enough

569.839 --> 577.839
no no fire truck outside

585.2 --> 590.9590000000001
sometimes they do go past i think

588.0 --> 594.16
yesterday on the debates

590.959 --> 595.3599999999999
when i had my mic open then like a fire

594.16 --> 597.76
truck came by

595.36 --> 599.92
like in in that street so it's pretty

597.76 --> 605.8389999999999
loud

599.92 --> 605.8389999999999
but not right now

617.39 --> 620.51
[Music]

625.68 --> 630.399
right anyway uh yeah

628.8 --> 647.8389999999999

okay so i'll be there it's gonna be in

658.32 --> 662.6400000000001
roughly five and a half hours from now

670.0 --> 675.839
it looks like it's gonna be about

671.76 --> 675.8389999999999
science again

680.0 --> 687.04
yeah no no no fed of course

683.36 --> 689.279
but it's saturday so sometimes it's

687.04 --> 703.8389999999999
yeah it's usually one weekend it's well

689.279 --> 703.8389999999999
buster's life the other weekend it's not

721.519 --> 726.72
so wind still i don't know every time it

723.76 --> 729.6
gets really weird still i

726.72 --> 733.6800000000001
tend to get a little short of breath

729.6 --> 733.6800000000001
because i guess the heat then creeps up

733.92 --> 745.8389999999999
well outside it's pretty it's pretty

736.24 --> 745.839
nice and fresh actually

749.38 --> 752.419
[Music]

756.839 --> 773.58
hmm

758.8 --> 776.789
i think i'll take off my sandals

773.58 --> 776.789
[Music]

784.24 --> 788.16
hey yeah talking about sailboats i saw a

786.959 --> 791.5189999999999
uh

788.16 --> 794.0
a an old-fashioned uh sloop

791.519 --> 795.44
like a i don't know i don't remember

794.0 --> 797.839
what they're called but they're pretty

795.44 --> 802.399
big sailboats

797.839 --> 804.48
they're like at least 10 meters tall

802.399 --> 805.519
and it's like a lot a lot of it is all

804.48 --> 807.839
wood

805.519 --> 809.519
this is not steel it's almost all of it

807.839 --> 812.8800000000001
is wood

809.519 --> 814.079
i saw one coming by like not even an

812.88 --> 817.2
hour ago on the

814.079 --> 819.68
on the river right next to me it was

817.2 --> 822.0790000000001
funny to see that again

819.68 --> 824.16
because i've been on one of those boats

822.079 --> 828.65
through school trip

824.16 --> 831.73
that's a long time ago

828.65 --> 831.73
[Music]

840.839 --> 843.839
uh

846.24 --> 848.5600000000001
right

854.399 --> 858.32
oh yeah by the way good servant thank

856.16 --> 860.8
you for the link you gave me

858.32 --> 863.12
to the video of that channel what's this

860.8 --> 864.7199999999999
what's it called again

863.12 --> 871.44
i thought it was actually a pretty good

864.72 --> 875.36
channel at least i liked that video

871.44 --> 878.1600000000001
let me see rise

875.36 --> 878.16
capital letters

878.72 --> 883.1990000000001
he has a lot of subscribers like he's a

881.12 --> 885.839
he's a pretty damn christian

883.199 --> 888.079
channel it seems but it's interesting

885.839 --> 890.8800000000001
because he's also

888.079 --> 891.68
explaining in these 40 minutes from way

890.88 --> 894.72
back

891.68 --> 897.3599999999999
like how we started out and it yeah

894.72 --> 899.44
that reminds me a lot of what i've been

897.36 --> 901.1990000000001
through

899.44 --> 903.7600000000001
like it's really talking about the

901.199 --> 906.24
mistakes and yeah i like his

903.76 --> 908.24
christian approach esoteric is he

906.24 --> 910.839
esoteric i don't know he seems very

908.24 --> 914.48
scriptural

910.839 --> 918.0790000000001
but he does have a good

914.48 --> 926.72
feel for the frequencies so

918.079 --> 929.5999999999999
yeah i like that

926.72 --> 929.6
yeah check him out

930.0 --> 933.279
and he definitely also explains like the

932.56 --> 938.8
dangers

933.279 --> 940.639
of yeah of dipping into the darkness

938.8 --> 943.04
and that you can really get caught up

940.639 --> 946.72
basically describing

943.04 --> 946.7199999999999
also safonier syndrome

952.839 --> 957.859
added

954.72 --> 957.859
[Music]

966.839 --> 969.839
hey

976.639 --> 982.48
right anyway it was pretty good

980.0 --> 984.16
because he's not so attention grab he

982.48 --> 988.0790000000001
was just very subtle

984.16 --> 991.6
very honest like i can feel that

988.079 --> 994.16
he it's kind of the same

991.6 --> 996.5600000000001
experience as i have felt it like he

994.16 --> 999.92
fears god because he realized basically

996.56 --> 1002.399
what he was doing in the past

999.92 --> 1004.079
and i can see it i can feel it from yeah

1002.399 --> 1007.759
he's like confessing

1004.079 --> 1010.7199999999999
basically with the will to

1007.759 --> 1013.839
to leave it behind him yeah and it's

1010.72 --> 1013.839
really good to see that

1020.959 --> 1025.12
yeah i do think he is genuine and if

1023.839 --> 1028.24
he's not you know it

1025.12 --> 1030.0
the the thing is even with these people

1028.24 --> 1031.6
you're genuine it doesn't mean that they

1030.0 --> 1034.0
cannot somehow

1031.6 --> 1035.039
fall back into old positions it all

1034.0 --> 1038.48
depends on

1035.039 --> 1040.559
what your life is like and

1038.48 --> 1043.199
how easy it is to avoid getting in

1040.559 --> 1045.52
contact with influences

1043.199 --> 1047.679
that will push you back because that

1045.52 --> 1050.72
happens

1047.679 --> 1053.44
they'll try to pull you back like

1050.72 --> 1055.6000000000001
reason i kind of dropped my old friend

1053.44 --> 1058.64
circle

1055.6 --> 1063.12
piece by piece because they all did that

1058.64 --> 1063.1200000000001
they were all anti-christian pretty much

1064.88 --> 1069.679
and like not willing to even consider it

1067.6 --> 1071.6
you know and that is like unacceptable

1069.679 --> 1073.6000000000001
to me like everything has

1071.6 --> 1074.799
at some point had to be considered just

1073.6 --> 1077.9189999999999
to figure it out

1074.799 --> 1080.4
to figure out what is real and they just

1077.919 --> 1083.039
would not

1080.4 --> 1084.96
that made them irrational to me which

1083.039 --> 1086.48
was kind of the reason

1084.96 --> 1088.32
because they pretended to be all

1086.48 --> 1090.64
rational that i

1088.32 --> 1091.4399999999998
thought it was a good idea to be part of

1090.64 --> 1093.1200000000001
that

1091.44 --> 1095.44
and then it turned out to be quite the

1093.12 --> 1097.6789999999999
opposite they were actually not rational

1095.44 --> 1101.28
at all

1097.679 --> 1101.2800000000002
kind of like what the ballers are doing

1101.6 --> 1105.52
very much like it by the way and hey i

1104.32 --> 1110.48
by that

1105.52 --> 1112.8799999999999
in that time still had baller religion

1110.48 --> 1115.679
but yeah i was never really even that

1112.88 --> 1118.48
interested in really defending

1115.679 --> 1119.2800000000002
the ball against religion or something

1118.48 --> 1122.96
no i was

1119.28 --> 1124.48
just i just wanted to get it figured out

1122.96 --> 1126.48
and i thought back then that like the

1124.48 --> 1127.84
ball is a very complex thing and it has

1126.48 --> 1129.6
to be built

1127.84 --> 1131.1999999999998
people are still working on it because

1129.6 --> 1133.36
reality is so

1131.2 --> 1137.52
complex and all that that's what i

1133.36 --> 1139.4399999999998
thought because i didn't understand yet

1137.52 --> 1140.6399999999999
so even though i was kind of a baller i

1139.44 --> 1143.8400000000001
would not go

1140.64 --> 1148.0800000000002
into discussion you know if i i

1143.84 --> 1150.48
met a flat earther i would just be

1148.08 --> 1151.1999999999998
i would act like a psychologist not

1150.48 --> 1154.0
really

1151.2 --> 1155.44
like oh you're so stupid oh you're so

1154.0 --> 1158.16
mistaken not like that but

1155.44 --> 1159.1200000000001
really just like i really want to

1158.16 --> 1161.8400000000001
understand like

1159.12 --> 1163.28
how that works like how could they think

1161.84 --> 1166.0
that

1163.28 --> 1166.8799999999999
because i was very convinced of my side

1166.0 --> 1171.28
as most

1166.88 --> 1173.679
ballers are and and normies

1171.28 --> 1176.6399999999999
that yeah that have studied in that a

1173.679 --> 1176.64
little at least

1182.72 --> 1189.919
so yeah for me the the chances of me

1185.76 --> 1192.96
falling back are is

1189.919 --> 1196.0
yeah that seems zero

1192.96 --> 1196.0
can't guarantee it

1196.799 --> 1200.16
like hey if i could be

1200.32 --> 1205.36
seriously broken in some way and not

1203.36 --> 1207.28
don't consider that yeah that's an

1205.36 --> 1211.039
option because i'll fight it

1207.28 --> 1213.6789999999999
harder than i even did before like

1211.039 --> 1214.48
originally my strategy for it was kind

1213.679 --> 1217.039
of to like

1214.48 --> 1218.4
halfway [ __ ] through it and then try to

1217.039 --> 1220.48
escape at the end

1218.4 --> 1222.64
you know the energy of trying to break

1220.48 --> 1225.28
me is blown

1222.64 --> 1226.96
but that still leaves damage now i'm in

1225.28 --> 1228.559
a position where that's just not gonna

1226.96 --> 1232.48
happen

1228.559 --> 1235.84
like yeah and that's probably why

1232.48 --> 1235.84
there's no real

1236.24 --> 1242.88
i don't feel like

1239.28 --> 1244.799
there's people looming over me any

1242.88 --> 1246.159
and they can change me any moment i kind

1244.799 --> 1249.6
of used to feel like that

1246.159 --> 1251.44
even like four years ago i felt very

1249.6 --> 1254.24
threatened

1251.44 --> 1256.559
but now i just noticed it's all just

1254.24 --> 1262.24
really pathetic people

1256.559 --> 1265.6
that like hate me for being free

1262.24 --> 1268.159
and not complying but

1265.6 --> 1269.84
they don't have any strength to really

1268.159 --> 1272.96
change me

1269.84 --> 1275.36
they're they're you know their

1272.96 --> 1277.28
ugliness which is very apparent to me

1275.36 --> 1281.84
from this position

1277.28 --> 1284.8799999999999
just encouraged me to basically yeah

1281.84 --> 1287.12
to double down on my position

1284.88 --> 1289.1200000000001
it just ensures that i'm not gonna go

1287.12 --> 1291.36
back to that side because i would never

1289.12 --> 1305.84
want to be side by side with these

1291.36 --> 1310.559
people in any circumstances

1305.84 --> 1310.559
what john c oddity

1316.84 --> 1319.84
ugh

1320.32 --> 1325.52
yeah problems with me masking your kids

1323.76 --> 1328.32
to school yeah duh

1325.52 --> 1328.32
homeschooling

1328.559 --> 1334.8799999999999
you should have already arranged that

1332.48 --> 1337.3600000000001
you know mask masking your kids to

1334.88 --> 1340.64
school is

1337.36 --> 1340.6399999999999
is really terrible

1343.44 --> 1349.44
that's gonna leave damage if not

1346.88 --> 1353.0390000000002
physical then psychological don't

1349.44 --> 1353.039
underestimate what it's gonna do

1354.799 --> 1358.48
like unless they have a really strong

1357.2 --> 1360.64
physique

1358.48 --> 1361.84
and they're not easily panicked you know

1360.64 --> 1364.7990000000002
and yeah

1361.84 --> 1367.12
many small kids are relatively easily

1364.799 --> 1370.1589999999999
panicked so

1367.12 --> 1374.02
yeah it's masking up little kids is just

1370.159 --> 1377.15
a terrible idea

1374.02 --> 1377.15
[Music]

1380.77 --> 1386.69
[Music]

1386.84 --> 1389.84
me

1399.44 --> 1402.88
right a vacation indeed but i would

1402.32 --> 1405.2
definitely

1402.88 --> 1406.5590000000002
look there's a chance that this

1405.2 --> 1409.8400000000001
craziness

1406.559 --> 1410.96
and dysfunctionality due to the medical

1409.84 --> 1414.24
dictatorship

1410.96 --> 1417.6000000000001
nonsense that it could last

1414.24 --> 1420.72
very long you know

1417.6 --> 1423.12
a year maybe maybe it'll be

1420.72 --> 1425.039
it will finally be gone in a year but

1423.12 --> 1427.6
there's also a chance that this [ __ ] can

1425.039 --> 1431.84
just last for five years

1427.6 --> 1435.12
seriously guys she

1431.84 --> 1438.48
they have they they they might just

1435.12 --> 1440.3999999999999
do that like one way or the other that's

1438.48 --> 1441.919
not saying that literally last five

1440.4 --> 1444.3200000000002
years but it could

1441.919 --> 1445.039
like it seems absolute madness and it

1444.32 --> 1448.559
would be

1445.039 --> 1450.4
but that doesn't mean it wouldn't happen

1448.559 --> 1451.76
despite everything despite everything

1450.4 --> 1454.3200000000002
that's come out

1451.76 --> 1455.919
they could still somehow enforce it

1454.32 --> 1458.08
through the politics and media they

1455.919 --> 1460.3200000000002
could just still push it anyway

1458.08 --> 1461.6789999999999
because that's that's how they do things

1460.32 --> 1464.1589999999999
now typically

1461.679 --> 1465.76
and they do want to double down on this

1464.159 --> 1466.159
they want to make it the new normal and

1465.76 --> 1468.32
that

1466.159 --> 1471.2
seems absolutely insane it is but it

1468.32 --> 1473.36
doesn't mean it's not going to happen

1471.2 --> 1475.44
because these people are just set in

1473.36 --> 1477.76
their ways

1475.44 --> 1479.8400000000001
they have this crazy plan and they don't

1477.76 --> 1483.279
care about

1479.84 --> 1486.08
the long-term consequences

1483.279 --> 1486.64
and then yeah some of them may hope for

1486.08 --> 1488.72
deadly

1486.64 --> 1490.7990000000002
long-term consequences and that's why

1488.72 --> 1494.0
they engage in it

1490.799 --> 1494.0
very creepy people

1495.36 --> 1501.52
so yeah homeschooling

1498.48 --> 1502.24
like as a permanent solution you should

1501.52 --> 1504.48
consider it

1502.24 --> 1506.559
you know keeping your kids away from the

1504.48 --> 1508.08
school situation for a year yeah that

1506.559 --> 1510.6399999999999
might fix it

1508.08 --> 1511.12
but they also might simply arrive back

1510.64 --> 1513.44
to

1511.12 --> 1514.559
the same situation and then yeah what

1513.44 --> 1516.64
you're going to do you're going to mask

1514.559 --> 1519.9189999999999
them up anyway

1516.64 --> 1522.4
i wouldn't do that so homeschooling very

1519.919 --> 1522.4
important

1523.44 --> 1529.8400000000001
figure it out

1540.84 --> 1543.84
uh

1545.52 --> 1548.48
are you getting wisdom

1549.12 --> 1557.84
kung fee

1566.51 --> 1571.84
[Music]

1568.84 --> 1571.84
anyway

1572.48 --> 1576.0
yeah that's my advice on on that

1574.4 --> 1578.799
situation

1576.0 --> 1581.44
anything else any other questions or

1578.799 --> 1585.84
ideas or

1581.44 --> 1585.8400000000001
noteworthy things

1586.23 --> 1592.259
[Music]

1610.08 --> 1615.039
yeah i know my arguments very

1612.799 --> 1616.96
disciplined

1615.039 --> 1619.279
all the way into scientific method and

1616.96 --> 1619.279
all that

1619.6 --> 1624.84
so i'm up against the half the world of

1623.44 --> 1627.6000000000001
thinkers that are now

1624.84 --> 1629.279
defending science the wider

1627.6 --> 1631.36
interpretation of science and then

1629.279 --> 1632.96
complaining how it's being abused by a

1631.36 --> 1635.12
certain group of people that are just

1632.96 --> 1638.96
doing everything false

1635.12 --> 1639.84
yeah that's because it's all not science

1638.96 --> 1642.88
that's not

1639.84 --> 1646.24
science science is a scientific method

1642.88 --> 1649.679
it doesn't mean as much as you would

1646.24 --> 1651.679
want it to the colloquial version

1649.679 --> 1655.039
just made it very popular like ooh

1651.679 --> 1658.5590000000002
discover knowledge through empiricism

1655.039 --> 1660.399
sort of but with other branches of

1658.559 --> 1661.6
interpretation and so you can do

1660.399 --> 1664.399
anything with it what you

1661.6 --> 1667.36
what you like but that's all sort of a

1664.399 --> 1668.08
cultural revolution type situation it's

1667.36 --> 1672.399
not

1668.08 --> 1674.6399999999999
real it's an idea it's an inspiration

1672.399 --> 1675.9189999999999
in actuality it's just a method it's

1674.64 --> 1680.88
just an empirical

1675.919 --> 1685.1200000000001
method to figure out the physical

1680.88 --> 1687.919
from the yeah from the conceptual

1685.12 --> 1690.1589999999999
to figure out the cause of an effect

1687.919 --> 1693.44
because of things

1690.159 --> 1694.96
by varying and manipulating it what you

1693.44 --> 1698.0800000000002
presume that

1694.96 --> 1701.039
the cause is of the effect

1698.08 --> 1702.799
uh and that's it and yeah there's so

1701.039 --> 1703.76
many people out there that just don't

1702.799 --> 1706.0
like it

1703.76 --> 1706.8799999999999
and yeah the more i think about it the

1706.0 --> 1711.679
more i am

1706.88 --> 1713.2
categorizing these people with blabblers

1711.679 --> 1715.3600000000001
it's the people that just want to blah

1713.2 --> 1718.64
blah blah blah blah and seem

1715.36 --> 1722.6399999999999
glorious they like the cultural

1718.64 --> 1725.1200000000001
icono iconography they like that science

1722.64 --> 1728.96
has been colloquialized

1725.12 --> 1728.9599999999998
it makes them seem smarter

1730.48 --> 1734.88
see and they like that it's blablars

1734.399 --> 1738.08
like that

1734.88 --> 1740.5590000000002
blabblers like when

1738.08 --> 1742.08
they have a lot of uh what do you say

1740.559 --> 1745.84
momentum or

1742.08 --> 1748.6399999999999
people that believe in them or

1745.84 --> 1751.4399999999998
that they just captivate people with

1748.64 --> 1753.2
their range of words

1751.44 --> 1755.76
and they don't really care about the

1753.2 --> 1758.88
content or building it

1755.76 --> 1763.52
they just want to keep people

1758.88 --> 1763.5200000000002
on them and whatever they're doing

1765.36 --> 1770.799
i try not to be like that and hey i'm

1768.0 --> 1772.48
i'm kind of too boring to be a blabbler

1770.799 --> 1775.6
because i have long pauses a real

1772.48 --> 1781.84
blabbler never stops talking

1775.6 --> 1781.84
this is

1782.72 --> 1789.3600000000001
george and yeti nuke yeah he

1786.0 --> 1791.679
is a blabbler he's very ellen and

1789.36 --> 1792.4799999999998
the the freaky thing is i halfway like

1791.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
the way he

1792.48 --> 1799.3600000000001
he blabblers

1795.84 --> 1800.399
he has a he's not so bonatone in his

1799.36 --> 1803.279
voice

1800.399 --> 1804.08
and he does know a lot he is just a

1803.279 --> 1806.399
blabbler

1804.08 --> 1809.6
that's the problem he likes he wants it

1806.399 --> 1814.08
he wants the power of an authority and

1809.6 --> 1814.08
he does it for the respect

1816.96 --> 1823.8400000000001
you're not boring well okay

1823.919 --> 1826.96
thank you amanda young

1827.279 --> 1832.08
i try not to be but i just i don't

1830.64 --> 1835.679
always have

1832.08 --> 1838.559
like complicated things on my mind

1835.679 --> 1838.5590000000002
constantly you know

1839.44 --> 1843.919
to me it's just little lights it's just

1842.24 --> 1844.72
something pops in there and then it's

1843.919 --> 1847.76
like oh

1844.72 --> 1850.799
quick i put it down in a way

1847.76 --> 1852.799
i am using

1850.799 --> 1854.399
youtube funnily enough while i'm live

1852.799 --> 1858.24
streaming and doing that i'm also

1854.399 --> 1861.7199999999998
using it as a as a recording device

1858.24 --> 1865.039
you know back in the day a lot of even

1861.72 --> 1867.919
scientists or field researchers

1865.039 --> 1868.32
you know that that people would have

1867.919 --> 1870.48
tape

1868.32 --> 1872.72
recorders my mother by the way as a

1870.48 --> 1875.1200000000001
musician also had that

1872.72 --> 1876.48
tape recorders they'd have with them and

1875.12 --> 1878.6399999999999
then they could

1876.48 --> 1880.24
if they had an idea record it they would

1878.64 --> 1882.96
speak it out and record it

1880.24 --> 1884.0
you know because that helps a lot

1882.96 --> 1887.1200000000001
because if you just

1884.0 --> 1890.96
have the idea then

1887.12 --> 1892.0
yeah it it may alter or you might forget

1890.96 --> 1894.559
elements about it or

1892.0 --> 1896.64
the impression might dim down but if you

1894.559 --> 1897.44
record it you record the moment and the

1896.64 --> 1900.64
energy of

1897.44 --> 1902.48
how it feels like for you also and the

1900.64 --> 1905.3600000000001
funny thing is that doing the youtube

1902.48 --> 1907.76
streams it kind of works the same way so

1905.36 --> 1909.039
yeah i do record a lot of interesting

1907.76 --> 1912.64
ideas that literally

1909.039 --> 1914.64
pop up spontaneously

1912.64 --> 1917.44
and i've always had that type of thing

1914.64 --> 1918.7990000000002
that interesting or fresh or something

1917.44 --> 1921.279
unique

1918.799 --> 1922.24
a new idea would pop out of nowhere very

1921.279 --> 1924.559
easily

1922.24 --> 1925.519
but yeah i wouldn't record it so you can

1924.559 --> 1928.08
imagine that like

1925.519 --> 1930.3990000000001
a hundred thousand ideas just slipped me

1928.08 --> 1930.399
by

1930.799 --> 1934.0
they slipped me by i came up with them

1932.72 --> 1937.039
sometimes i would draw

1934.0 --> 1937.679
something to tell my parents or my

1937.039 --> 1939.6
brother

1937.679 --> 1942.96
and then i just forget about it and then

1939.6 --> 1942.9599999999998
the next day something new

1943.12 --> 1949.84
happen all the time

1957.519 --> 1962.08
yeah and i've been very fascinated with

1960.0 --> 1963.2
the concept of bending a space-time i

1962.08 --> 1966.72
believed that

1963.2 --> 1968.64
for a long time it was my brother

1966.72 --> 1970.159
as i said before he really tried to

1968.64 --> 1973.679
explain to me that it's

1970.159 --> 1975.8400000000001
not real but i didn't understand

1973.679 --> 1977.76
like i i was really shocked by that and

1975.84 --> 1980.0
didn't understand and after that point i

1977.76 --> 1982.1589999999999
kind of lost interest because

1980.0 --> 1984.08
i was just looking at like wow if my

1982.159 --> 1987.8400000000001
brother is correct and he might just be

1984.08 --> 1990.6399999999999
because he is very smart he sees things

1987.84 --> 1992.24
sharper like he wisened up a lot quicker

1990.64 --> 1994.88
than i did

1992.24 --> 1995.919
he's probably just as smart slightly

1994.88 --> 1998.64
different

1995.919 --> 2000.0800000000002
very good visual memory and all that

1998.64 --> 2003.76
very quick

2000.08 --> 2004.08
in seeing things that he risen up a lot

2003.76 --> 2006.64
quicker

2004.08 --> 2008.399
he matured a lot quicker and he he's got

2006.64 --> 2011.919
a family you know he

2008.399 --> 2016.4799999999998
he got it i i got lost i got lost in the

2011.919 --> 2020.48
through crazy [ __ ] in my own foolishness

2016.48 --> 2023.2
but i couldn't handle it back then

2020.48 --> 2025.2
like that's not real like einstein

2023.2 --> 2026.24
that's all conceptual and i was like

2025.2 --> 2031.039
what but

2026.24 --> 2033.919
but the world is saying it's real

2031.039 --> 2034.32
and this is just like oh this is too

2033.919 --> 2036.72
much

2034.32 --> 2039.2
i can't handle this [ __ ] like i'm gonna

2036.72 --> 2042.799
like i basically after that point

2039.2 --> 2045.3600000000001
kind of abandoned it

2042.799 --> 2046.0
in favor of spiritual research and i was

2045.36 --> 2048.24
just like no

2046.0 --> 2050.399
i'm gonna do my own occult research and

2048.24 --> 2052.0789999999997
some creepy people even shoved certain

2050.399 --> 2054.6389999999997
books under my face

2052.079 --> 2057.2000000000003
like oh this is like really heavy magic

2054.639 --> 2059.44
[ __ ] and i was like that's

2057.2 --> 2060.72
totally [ __ ] up i don't want to read

2059.44 --> 2063.919
that i'm gonna

2060.72 --> 2068.6389999999997
purely from myself from a very innocent

2063.919 --> 2068.6389999999997
vantage point i'm going to explore this

2069.76 --> 2073.3590000000004
just figure out the frequencies and the

2071.599 --> 2075.119
energies and the patterns what did they

2073.359 --> 2078.0
mean where did they come from

2075.119 --> 2079.44
what does it do to you besides an idea

2078.0 --> 2083.04
and that's how i made

2079.44 --> 2085.2000000000003
one of my first websites symbolics.now

2083.04 --> 2089.44
it's still on

2085.2 --> 2091.4399999999996
how so long ago

2089.44 --> 2093.119
and one of the more interesting studies

2091.44 --> 2093.679
that came out of it still kind of stands

2093.119 --> 2097.359
is like

2093.679 --> 2100.56
the psychological

2097.359 --> 2104.7999999999997
spiritual influences of patterns

2100.56 --> 2104.7999999999997
i studied the effect of patterns

2105.2 --> 2116.3999999999996
like what does it do in a

2108.4 --> 2119.76
yeah in a verbally descriptive way

2116.4 --> 2123.599
yeah i have stared in the black mary

2119.76 --> 2125.76
it's it's nothing it's only something if

2123.599 --> 2125.76
you

2127.04 --> 2133.2799999999997
if you make it something you know

2130.4 --> 2134.7200000000003
but i got before that before i even

2133.28 --> 2136.48
tried that

2134.72 --> 2138.56
like i wasn't looking for freaking

2136.48 --> 2140.48
demons you know i didn't need to look

2138.56 --> 2142.88
for demons at the time because they were

2140.48 --> 2146.079
kind of around me

2142.88 --> 2147.6800000000003
spirits but spirits that were not super

2146.079 --> 2149.92
nice

2147.68 --> 2151.7599999999998
but they would still kind of respect me

2149.92 --> 2154.48
up to a certain degree as far as i would

2151.76 --> 2156.2400000000002
respect myself it's complicated

2154.48 --> 2157.68
and not saying that i saw physical

2156.24 --> 2159.839
things around me but like

2157.68 --> 2161.9199999999996
spirits around me you know i still

2159.839 --> 2164.64
exactly have those same sensors i can

2161.92 --> 2166.96
feel when they're around but

2164.64 --> 2168.3199999999997
they haven't been around for a long time

2166.96 --> 2170.32
because

2168.32 --> 2172.2400000000002
as i progressed through that i just

2170.32 --> 2173.04
started to figure out like where is that

2172.24 --> 2175.2
going where

2173.04 --> 2176.16
i got other i learned about other people

2175.2 --> 2180.24
like

2176.16 --> 2182.3199999999997
which types and yeah not all those types

2180.24 --> 2184.64
of witches were actually

2182.32 --> 2186.8
good witches although some of them

2184.64 --> 2187.7599999999998
thought they were but they would tell me

2186.8 --> 2191.28
things that they did

2187.76 --> 2192.61
that just like that's not that's not

2191.28 --> 2194.4
good

2192.61 --> 2196.4
[Music]

2194.4 --> 2198.1600000000003
and so i just figured out what is

2196.4 --> 2201.119
happening what is happening to all these

2198.16 --> 2203.2799999999997
people that do this sort of thing

2201.119 --> 2204.7200000000003
and where is that going and where do

2203.28 --> 2207.119
they even say about it

2204.72 --> 2209.5989999999997
that it's going for them is it right are

2207.119 --> 2212.839
they correct or are they delusional

2209.599 --> 2214.88
and eventually i figured out like this

2212.839 --> 2217.92
is

2214.88 --> 2221.2000000000003
this is not working it's no

2217.92 --> 2224.56
use because if you're kind of like

2221.2 --> 2226.96
um if you start to wear pentagrams for

2224.56 --> 2229.04
example out in the open

2226.96 --> 2231.2
like yeah that does things but the

2229.04 --> 2232.88
problem is is the context of it all the

2231.2 --> 2234.3999999999996
context that it has now

2232.88 --> 2237.359
because of everything that's done it's

2234.4 --> 2239.599
like the meanings of the symbols and it

2237.359 --> 2242.72
their power have been corrupted

2239.599 --> 2243.44
by the culture for a long long time and

2242.72 --> 2245.5989999999997
i

2243.44 --> 2249.28
there is a part in my symbolics that

2245.599 --> 2252.96
nail site that describes that too

2249.28 --> 2252.96
in the meaning section so

2254.88 --> 2261.04
yeah and that's like

2258.079 --> 2261.04
12 years old

2261.92 --> 2274.4
that site isn't that pretty incredible

2270.72 --> 2278.24
i don't know don't know if you care

2274.4 --> 2278.2400000000002
i'll post the link of it

2279.119 --> 2282.48
in my chat anyway

2282.839 --> 2285.839
see

2294.0 --> 2300.64
it's it's pretty

2297.68 --> 2303.44
archaic compared to how i've developed

2300.64 --> 2305.2
my own ideas since then

2303.44 --> 2308.88
it was just really in the time when i

2305.2 --> 2311.9199999999996
was into how i described it patternism

2308.88 --> 2312.7200000000003
which is the idea that everything yeah

2311.92 --> 2315.04
it's basically

2312.72 --> 2315.839
sort of a mathematical belief but not as

2315.04 --> 2317.92
much

2315.839 --> 2319.599
it's not literally math is reality but i

2317.92 --> 2320.4
did have like the fundamental belief

2319.599 --> 2323.119
that

2320.4 --> 2324.48
all things are fundamentally a singular

2323.119 --> 2326.7200000000003
pattern

2324.48 --> 2329.52
it's like all things are one pattern and

2326.72 --> 2332.72
interestingly enough

2329.52 --> 2335.28
now that i consider that everything is

2332.72 --> 2338.3199999999997
basically created by god

2335.28 --> 2338.7200000000003
yeah that that kind of does correlate in

2338.32 --> 2342.32
a way

2338.72 --> 2346.56
you know also yeah pattern

2342.32 --> 2348.56
is very close to like paternity

2346.56 --> 2350.56
to me it's not literally the same stem

2348.56 --> 2352.7999999999997
of words but it's very similar so it's

2350.56 --> 2355.04
funny how that kind of works out that

2352.8 --> 2358.6400000000003
what i call the pattern

2355.04 --> 2362.72
could literally be god but god

2358.64 --> 2363.68
described in a in a pattern in a formula

2362.72 --> 2366.16
in a

2363.68 --> 2366.96
in a structure in a overarching

2366.16 --> 2369.1189999999997
structure

2366.96 --> 2370.0
sort of a mathematical derivative

2369.119 --> 2371.92
structure but

2370.0 --> 2374.32
i also declared about the pattern that

2371.92 --> 2375.76
it is technically impossible to ever get

2374.32 --> 2379.76
it

2375.76 --> 2383.28
like but it but conceptually like

2379.76 --> 2383.9100000000003
it it's very conceivable that it should

2383.28 --> 2386.5600000000004
be there

2383.91 --> 2388.8799999999997
[Music]

2386.56 --> 2389.68
and funnily enough in a way i could even

2388.88 --> 2392.079
say that

2389.68 --> 2394.3999999999996
yeah maybe the intellect can't grab it

2392.079 --> 2397.44
but the intuition

2394.4 --> 2399.359
may definitely get a feel for it it's

2397.44 --> 2401.2000000000003
funny you know like even the the

2399.359 --> 2402.56
frequencies the patterns of what we

2401.2 --> 2406.16
follow what we think is good

2402.56 --> 2407.04
logos and what we recognize at as bad as

2406.16 --> 2410.3999999999996
deviant

2407.04 --> 2413.2799999999997
from logos that's yeah that's

2410.4 --> 2414.88
part of the pattern and it is a pattern

2413.28 --> 2416.4
it's like these are the ways it

2414.88 --> 2420.56
functions

2416.4 --> 2422.64
so there's a pattern see anyway

2420.56 --> 2424.0
oh oh yeah thank you mandy young for the

2422.64 --> 2426.4
10 super chat donation

2424.0 --> 2427.28
and the two dollar super chat donation

2426.4 --> 2430.4
paypal

2427.28 --> 2430.4
okay i'll check it out

2434.319 --> 2438.0
i hope my paypal works this time was

2437.119 --> 2440.88
screwing around

2438.0 --> 2440.88
a lot yesterday

2441.599 --> 2446.319
yeah it's working oh thank you very much

2447.2 --> 2451.1189999999997
thank you so much for the for the

2449.52 --> 2454.4
continual support amanda

2451.119 --> 2454.4
i really appreciate that

2462.0 --> 2466.4
it's good yeah the way things are

2464.0 --> 2469.2
looking right now

2466.4 --> 2469.2000000000003
i think that

2473.44 --> 2478.7200000000003
like the uh the money that's probably

2477.2 --> 2482.16
yeah that's going to be taken out

2478.72 --> 2484.24
from may in my social welfare right now

2482.16 --> 2487.44
is probably evened out so i think i'm

2484.24 --> 2487.4399999999996
even in that that's good

2488.319 --> 2492.56
i think i already said that but yeah

2490.16 --> 2494.319
it's just good to know that

2492.56 --> 2496.72
thank you everyone for helping me out

2494.319 --> 2496.72
with that

2506.839 --> 2509.839
uh

2516.72 --> 2521.5989999999997
i know that if the earth was a ball and

2519.839 --> 2524.0789999999997
spinning there would be all kinds of

2521.599 --> 2527.6800000000003
asymmetrical

2524.079 --> 2527.6800000000003
forces going around

2528.24 --> 2536.4799999999996
i know like especially at the 45 degree

2533.04 --> 2539.119
angles because it would literally be

2536.48 --> 2542.72
going sidewards which would be

2539.119 --> 2545.52
like a 33 degree vector off

2542.72 --> 2546.319
push in where it's relatively still

2545.52 --> 2548.4
strong

2546.319 --> 2550.72
because supposedly the centrifugal force

2548.4 --> 2553.76
at the equator should be the strongest

2550.72 --> 2558.0789999999997
but if it's like halfway

2553.76 --> 2560.079
45 degrees after yeah in between

2558.079 --> 2561.119
then it's still going to be pretty much

2560.079 --> 2563.44
to the side

2561.119 --> 2565.52
relatively maximizing the centrifugal

2563.44 --> 2566.16
force while at the same time the gravity

2565.52 --> 2568.319
is at it

2566.16 --> 2569.359
the presupposed gravity is at a very

2568.319 --> 2572.16
different angle

2569.359 --> 2573.5989999999997
i've discussed this this was discussed

2572.16 --> 2575.359
like two years ago on the flat earth

2573.599 --> 2578.6400000000003
debates for a while

2575.359 --> 2580.56
i did a small presentation even about it

2578.64 --> 2582.56
about how that just doesn't work out

2580.56 --> 2583.2799999999997
force wise like it would always be

2582.56 --> 2586.88
noticed

2583.28 --> 2589.28
always even to such a degree that

2586.88 --> 2591.04
people might even get the sensation that

2589.28 --> 2594.3190000000004
the further north they go that they're

2591.04 --> 2594.319
suddenly going uphill

2594.64 --> 2601.2799999999997
seriously like because the the balance

2597.839 --> 2603.52
organ you know it's like our own little

2601.28 --> 2608.2400000000002
gyroscope

2603.52 --> 2611.44
it attunes itself to

2608.24 --> 2614.9599999999996
to what yeah what do you say the

2611.44 --> 2617.119
to water level i guess so it's gonna

2614.96 --> 2619.28
attune itself to however the forces are

2617.119 --> 2621.44
distributed you know

2619.28 --> 2623.599
and hey if it's slightly off well that

2621.44 --> 2626.8
means that to our intuition

2623.599 --> 2626.8
suddenly it would seem

2627.92 --> 2631.76
like you had to move forward to counter

2630.48 --> 2634.56
this slight

2631.76 --> 2636.3190000000004
side worse force and then everything

2634.56 --> 2637.44
would start to seem like climbing a

2636.319 --> 2639.839
mountain

2637.44 --> 2641.04
as you go north that could absolutely

2639.839 --> 2643.92
inevitably be

2641.04 --> 2643.92
the experience

2644.56 --> 2647.7599999999998
and it would yeah be prominent enough

2647.119 --> 2650.2400000000002
that

2647.76 --> 2651.3590000000004
it would probably have a cultural impact

2650.24 --> 2653.839
like

2651.359 --> 2654.64
it would be called going up the mountain

2653.839 --> 2657.92
if you go

2654.64 --> 2662.24
north after a certain point going down

2657.92 --> 2663.839
the mountain if you go back to the

2662.24 --> 2665.68
equator that kind of thing anyway but

2663.839 --> 2667.599
it's not happening because there it yeah

2665.68 --> 2670.64
obviously the earth is not spinning

2667.599 --> 2672.8
stars are spinning the lights

2670.64 --> 2674.72
the earth is very much stationary as

2672.8 --> 2677.92
regular gyroscopes prove

2674.72 --> 2680.0
since they don't you spin them up keep

2677.92 --> 2681.839
them spinning and they don't deviate if

2680.0 --> 2684.0
you don't change the position

2681.839 --> 2685.92
and if you change their position they

2684.0 --> 2691.839
don't deviate either

2685.92 --> 2691.839
so yeah

2696.079 --> 2704.2400000000002
no what is great gravity is a

2699.839 --> 2707.839
reification fallacy it's a catch-all

2704.24 --> 2709.7599999999998
thing that includes model thinking

2707.839 --> 2711.7599999999998
heliocentric model thinking but it's

2709.76 --> 2714.48
basically

2711.76 --> 2716.4
a oversimplified version to explain the

2714.48 --> 2718.88
relative density this equilibrium

2716.4 --> 2723.04
situation going on so relative density

2718.88 --> 2725.76
that's that was official that we didn't

2723.04 --> 2727.599
make that up from scratch that existed

2725.76 --> 2730.88
it already was there

2727.599 --> 2732.7200000000003
relative density i yeah i

2730.88 --> 2734.56
basically just refined it i think

2732.72 --> 2735.359
conceptually and it works out really

2734.56 --> 2739.04
well

2735.359 --> 2742.16
so yeah the effects of

2739.04 --> 2745.2
going down going up is then attributed

2742.16 --> 2748.24
as gravity and then you put in a lot of

2745.2 --> 2751.4399999999996
misconceptions you suggest that it's not

2748.24 --> 2754.24
an effect a phenomena that's like a

2751.44 --> 2756.88
side effect of the situation which has

2754.24 --> 2758.4799999999996
already been proven

2756.88 --> 2760.1600000000003
and yeah then you make up the whole

2758.48 --> 2763.359
story about yeah how the ball is

2760.16 --> 2766.319
supposed to stick together

2763.359 --> 2767.68
why down is to the center of a of a

2766.319 --> 2771.119
sphere

2767.68 --> 2775.839
right it's a it's a reification fallacy

2771.119 --> 2775.839
it doesn't exist

2784.96 --> 2789.839
acceleration is not gravity

2790.079 --> 2795.76
acceleration is a side effect of a force

2793.599 --> 2798.6400000000003
gravity is officially not even because

2795.76 --> 2801.2000000000003
yeah not even classified as a force

2798.64 --> 2802.0
so it's it's already lost at it it's

2801.2 --> 2804.0
already lost

2802.0 --> 2806.64
it's already a cognitive dissonance in

2804.0 --> 2809.2
what it's even supposed to do

2806.64 --> 2810.7999999999997
but regular people consider the gravity

2809.2 --> 2813.7599999999998
to be that force

2810.8 --> 2816.6400000000003
it's not officially and yeah it is a

2813.76 --> 2819.0400000000004
reification fallacy because that

2816.64 --> 2820.64
the the force supposed force is caused

2819.04 --> 2824.8
by relative density

2820.64 --> 2831.839
this equilibrium that's provable it's

2824.8 --> 2831.8390000000004
empirically scientifically repeatable

2836.56 --> 2840.4
right yeah and the relative density this

2839.52 --> 2842.559
equilibrium

2840.4 --> 2843.6800000000003
causes a force and that includes

2842.559 --> 2848.96
acceleration because

2843.68 --> 2848.96
acceleration is the result of a force

2849.68 --> 2852.48
that's just it

2852.96 --> 2857.599
acceleration is not inherent to gravity

2855.839 --> 2861.52
it doesn't have anything to do

2857.599 --> 2863.319
with it you know

2861.52 --> 2865.7599999999998
that was only in the newtonian

2863.319 --> 2868.96
conceptualization which is not

2865.76 --> 2873.8390000000004
official anymore they don't use that

2868.96 --> 2873.839
so it's a reification fallacy

2875.359 --> 2881.68
yeah but as they they can say all

2878.48 --> 2883.2
they can say gas is like bouncy balls

2881.68 --> 2886.319
okay that doesn't make it true

2883.2 --> 2887.68
they say all kinds of [ __ ] they say that

2886.319 --> 2889.839
the football

2887.68 --> 2890.96
deviates because of coriolis of the

2889.839 --> 2893.52
earth so

2890.96 --> 2895.839
it's doesn't matter what they say it's

2893.52 --> 2895.839
not

2896.16 --> 2901.839
say a lot of [ __ ]

2912.839 --> 2916.7999999999997
ugh

2914.72 --> 2918.64
yeah that's right if you drop something

2916.8 --> 2921.76
it accelerates you know what because

2918.64 --> 2922.16
if you're presuming an item that item is

2921.76 --> 2924.0
very

2922.16 --> 2925.2
likely to be solid because you don't

2924.0 --> 2928.72
hold air

2925.2 --> 2931.4399999999996
right so that's the first step so you're

2928.72 --> 2932.7999999999997
holding a solid object you're probably

2931.44 --> 2935.359
holding a solid object

2932.8 --> 2935.92
standing in air because yeah you're not

2935.359 --> 2939.44
going to be

2935.92 --> 2941.2000000000003
cast in rock to do such a thing

2939.44 --> 2943.76
and in the water yeah you could do it

2941.2 --> 2946.7999999999997
sort of similar

2943.76 --> 2949.3590000000004
so yeah the object you're holding is

2946.8 --> 2950.0
much denser than the air you're standing

2949.359 --> 2953.119
in

2950.0 --> 2953.76
so as a result this equilibrium will

2953.119 --> 2956.319
cause

2953.76 --> 2959.2000000000003
a force on the object to try and find

2956.319 --> 2961.839
its equilibrium within the container

2959.2 --> 2962.64
so it's going to go down because it is

2961.839 --> 2964.96
more dense

2962.64 --> 2966.8799999999997
than the medium it is in as soon as you

2964.96 --> 2968.96
let it go

2966.88 --> 2971.2000000000003
because it does have to need yeah

2968.96 --> 2973.04
maneuverability in order to establi to

2971.2 --> 2974.24
actually get the motion going to get the

2973.04 --> 2977.359
acceleration

2974.24 --> 2981.1189999999997
and until then it's just going to cause

2977.359 --> 2985.119
pressure in the direction it wants to

2981.119 --> 2986.8
move at which is also going to be done

2985.119 --> 2991.119
and you're going to experience

2986.8 --> 2993.76
that pressure as weight

2991.119 --> 2996.319
it's an experience it is basically

2993.76 --> 2997.44
relative density this equilibrium force

2996.319 --> 3000.4
in a state

2997.44 --> 3001.839
of non-maneuverability it causes that

3000.4 --> 3003.44
pressure you're going to get that

3001.839 --> 3006.0789999999997
pressure it's going to be down because

3003.44 --> 3009.44
the rock is still very much heavier

3006.079 --> 3011.52
or denser than the medium it is in

3009.44 --> 3013.52
so yeah that's what's going on that's

3011.52 --> 3016.4
real not gravity

3013.52 --> 3027.839
gravity is a reification fallacy doesn't

3016.4 --> 3027.839
cause anything

3028.72 --> 3036.16
no no good servant force causes motion

3033.119 --> 3037.6800000000003
causes an acceleration but yeah if there

3036.16 --> 3040.72
is no maneuverability

3037.68 --> 3043.359
for an item in order to get to

3040.72 --> 3046.8799999999997
acceleration then instead it will

3043.359 --> 3046.88
translate into pressure

3048.88 --> 3055.2000000000003
it will push and hey

3051.92 --> 3058.319
even yeah try to take a

3055.2 --> 3059.68
flimsy plastic bag put a couple of

3058.319 --> 3062.0
bricks in it

3059.68 --> 3063.44
you can just carry that around right

3062.0 --> 3065.68
it'll stay you know

3063.44 --> 3067.68
the plastic might stretch up slightly or

3065.68 --> 3070.72
whatever but it'll be fine

3067.68 --> 3073.839
now sling it around with full force

3070.72 --> 3075.839
guess what's going to happen it's going

3073.839 --> 3079.04
to rip through the back

3075.839 --> 3081.119
because suddenly the force subjected to

3079.04 --> 3084.16
it it's going to be much more than just

3081.119 --> 3085.44
the bricks being suspended in this

3084.16 --> 3089.1189999999997
equilibrium with the

3085.44 --> 3097.839
surrounding air onto the plastic

3089.119 --> 3097.839
right so that's how it works

3108.839 --> 3111.839
so

3121.68 --> 3126.48
no there is no constant 9.8 meters per

3124.559 --> 3128.96
second

3126.48 --> 3128.96
squared

3131.28 --> 3137.76
that's only in in

3134.559 --> 3140.079
perfect vacuous state that's not

3137.76 --> 3142.559
everywhere so acceleration

3140.079 --> 3145.52
is going to be different because yeah

3142.559 --> 3149.3590000000004
that acceleration does not account for

3145.52 --> 3151.839
friction resistance doesn't even have to

3149.359 --> 3153.68
be something that literally holds it no

3151.839 --> 3154.4
just the resistance of the medium it's

3153.68 --> 3157.52
going through

3154.4 --> 3162.2400000000002
is going to slow down the

3157.52 --> 3164.96
it's gonna it's gonna create

3162.24 --> 3166.0
the the higher the friction the lower

3164.96 --> 3167.839
the terminal for

3166.0 --> 3169.68
velocity is it's going to reach a

3167.839 --> 3172.48
maximum speed at some point

3169.68 --> 3173.9199999999996
because the acceleration evens out with

3172.48 --> 3176.079
the friction and then finds an

3173.92 --> 3178.16
equilibrium therein so you get a maximum

3176.079 --> 3181.3590000000004
speed

3178.16 --> 3183.2
but yeah

3181.359 --> 3184.48
technically i would say that if you'd

3183.2 --> 3187.52
fall if something

3184.48 --> 3190.48
would fall for an extreme

3187.52 --> 3191.7599999999998
long drop like extremely high up then at

3190.48 --> 3193.599
the highest point it's going to

3191.76 --> 3195.76
accelerate the fastest because there's

3193.599 --> 3197.3590000000004
less air pressure

3195.76 --> 3199.92
so it's going to drop then reach a

3197.359 --> 3202.88
maximum velocity and then

3199.92 --> 3203.28
potentially in the last part if you

3202.88 --> 3205.28
don't

3203.28 --> 3207.6800000000003
open the parachute or whatever if it's

3205.28 --> 3210.3190000000004
just a brick and you're just measuring

3207.68 --> 3211.839
its height it's actually going to slow

3210.319 --> 3214.4
down somewhat

3211.839 --> 3217.2
you know why because certainly the

3214.4 --> 3219.6800000000003
friction is going to be slightly higher

3217.2 --> 3220.319
because there's more air pressure down

3219.68 --> 3224.0789999999997
and there's

3220.319 --> 3236.88
even like a oh yeah water

3224.079 --> 3240.319
vapor in there

3236.88 --> 3243.359
yeah relative density has a

3240.319 --> 3246.4
maximum if if the medium

3243.359 --> 3249.68
of an object is literally

3246.4 --> 3252.079
zero density then it will yeah

3249.68 --> 3254.16
fall with the maximum acceleration rate

3252.079 --> 3257.2000000000003
no matter what the object is like

3254.16 --> 3265.839
no matter the density because the this

3257.2 --> 3265.839
equilibrium is always going to be maxed

3276.16 --> 3279.2
yeah and there's not a constant

3277.839 --> 3282.16
acceleration there's only

3279.2 --> 3282.72
in a constant acceleration on things

3282.16 --> 3286.0789999999997
that are

3282.72 --> 3289.1189999999997
in this equilibrium with the density of

3286.079 --> 3289.119
the median they are in

3290.64 --> 3307.839
there's not a constant acceleration

3314.319 --> 3316.5589999999997
right

3318.4 --> 3324.64
so yeah look dude if you insist

3321.52 --> 3326.72
on calling the alignment of

3324.64 --> 3327.839
relative density this equilibrium

3326.72 --> 3330.8799999999997
displacement

3327.839 --> 3333.2
if you insist on calling that gravity by

3330.88 --> 3336.559
all means call it gravity

3333.2 --> 3340.16
but it is not a force and it does not

3336.559 --> 3342.0
cause it it's only a description

3340.16 --> 3344.3999999999996
of the real thing which is relative

3342.0 --> 3345.92
density this equilibrium force

3344.4 --> 3348.7200000000003
that's what's really happening that's

3345.92 --> 3352.16
imp empirically proven

3348.72 --> 3354.72
gravity is a reification fallacy if you

3352.16 --> 3355.52
are saying it causes the acceleration or

3354.72 --> 3358.64
it causes

3355.52 --> 3363.839
the fall or whatever you understand

3358.64 --> 3363.839
reckner stefan alderson

3376.16 --> 3380.24
hey jim if you're gonna do this again

3378.319 --> 3391.839
i'm gonna ban you

3380.24 --> 3391.839
stop bringing that [ __ ] up very serious

3395.18 --> 3398.2599999999998
[Music]

3404.559 --> 3407.599
i don't care if you're talking to

3406.0 --> 3419.839
somebody else i don't want that kind of

3407.599 --> 3419.839
language in my chat

3434.48 --> 3447.839
ah right three o'clock

3439.119 --> 3447.839
twenty more minutes

3458.88 --> 3465.28
hmm yeah mark collard well

3462.0 --> 3465.839
look the globers since they can't really

3465.28 --> 3468.88
win

3465.839 --> 3470.16
a point they're just sidestepping

3468.88 --> 3472.839
everything by

3470.16 --> 3474.8799999999997
trying to negate everything

3472.839 --> 3477.599
philosophically

3474.88 --> 3478.319
explaining why it doesn't matter

3477.599 --> 3479.92
basically

3478.319 --> 3482.319
that's what it comes down to yeah that

3479.92 --> 3483.359
that's what they've been doing a lot

3482.319 --> 3484.96
and they're trying to do it with

3483.359 --> 3486.0
everything they're saying natural law

3484.96 --> 3490.079
doesn't apply

3486.0 --> 3494.559
to nature they're saying laws

3490.079 --> 3494.559
don't apply to reality

3494.64 --> 3498.48
yeah they're they're just completely

3496.4 --> 3503.839
flipping everything inside out

3498.48 --> 3503.839
what's supposed to be

3514.839 --> 3517.839
what

3535.2 --> 3539.5989999999997
i already told you rector stefan elders

3537.359 --> 3542.88
and i've said it this hangout

3539.599 --> 3547.3590000000004
like eight times or something

3542.88 --> 3549.76
relative density disequilibrium

3547.359 --> 3549.7599999999998
force

3551.599 --> 3558.7200000000003
objects density in relation to

3554.799 --> 3573.839
medium density not in equilibrium

3558.72 --> 3573.839
force there you go

3580.799 --> 3583.2
is that

3584.96 --> 3588.319
it's the cause of the effect ragnar

3587.119 --> 3590.6400000000003
stefan hodderson

3588.319 --> 3601.839
that's what it is that makes it real it

3590.64 --> 3601.839
makes it science

3641.04 --> 3644.48
man it's a wind still

3651.359 --> 3659.04
do you have a situation or is that no

3654.88 --> 3660.799
what the hell why do you need a freaking

3659.04 --> 3663.44
citation

3660.799 --> 3668.0
we've done it we've done it on the flat

3663.44 --> 3670.799
earth debates there's many many videos

3668.0 --> 3672.16
remember tony with the egg in the water

3670.799 --> 3674.16
and the salt

3672.16 --> 3675.2
and the other one with the oil and the

3674.16 --> 3678.0
water and the other

3675.2 --> 3679.52
kind of liquids and ball thingies in it

3678.0 --> 3685.44
yeah

3679.52 --> 3688.559
that's what it is

3685.44 --> 3691.119
we've proven it why do i need to

3688.559 --> 3691.599
cite anyone i can literally cite myself

3691.119 --> 3696.319
i can

3691.599 --> 3698.559
cite tony how is that supposed to

3696.319 --> 3701.52
be critical we've done it we've

3698.559 --> 3701.52
literally done it

3701.599 --> 3713.839
like on camera

3717.119 --> 3720.48
no relative density does not give

3719.119 --> 3723.92
relative vector

3720.48 --> 3727.839
no it does doesn't

3723.92 --> 3727.839
vectors are very specific

3728.319 --> 3731.44
is established no it's just the way it

3730.64 --> 3735.1189999999997
is

3731.44 --> 3735.599
you see you prove the cause of the

3735.119 --> 3739.039
effect

3735.599 --> 3742.48
why you helium balloons go that way

3739.039 --> 3745.039
why do rocks go that way

3742.48 --> 3747.119
and then you'd vary on all of that and

3745.039 --> 3749.3590000000004
then you figure out yeah all things go

3747.119 --> 3750.48
this way or that way or they stay the

3749.359 --> 3754.64
same

3750.48 --> 3757.68
yeah why doesn't matter

3754.64 --> 3761.52
it literally doesn't matter

3757.68 --> 3764.64
it's just the way it is

3761.52 --> 3764.96
now what causes the things to actually

3764.64 --> 3767.52
do

3764.96 --> 3769.44
that displacements in those directions

3767.52 --> 3771.7599999999998
that is very much definable

3769.44 --> 3774.079
and empirically provable and that's

3771.76 --> 3777.3590000000004
relative density

3774.079 --> 3780.319
it doesn't tell you why

3777.359 --> 3782.24
why why why oh you don't have an answer

3780.319 --> 3783.7599999999998
well then i'm gonna make up a [ __ ]

3782.24 --> 3786.16
story about how the earth is a ball

3783.76 --> 3788.88
being kept by the freaking force

3786.16 --> 3789.7599999999998
together yeah yeah that's your

3788.88 --> 3793.2000000000003
alternative

3789.76 --> 3796.2400000000002
really nice we don't know

3793.2 --> 3798.24
why you can't really prove why because

3796.24 --> 3800.799
you can't very manipulate it

3798.24 --> 3803.359
it's elusive it's just the way it is

3800.799 --> 3803.359
there is no

3803.599 --> 3810.079
other thing there is no field or energy

3806.799 --> 3813.28
or anything that is detectable other

3810.079 --> 3815.3590000000004
than the effect that you can

3813.28 --> 3816.48
vary and manipulate in order to

3815.359 --> 3820.72
establish

3816.48 --> 3824.0
what's going on yeah we need scientific

3820.72 --> 3826.48
proof i we have scientifically

3824.0 --> 3828.96
proved it already told you are you not

3826.48 --> 3828.96
listening

3831.28 --> 3834.4
i've done it live

3834.72 --> 3839.839
you just go back and find it

3864.839 --> 3867.839
oh

3868.88 --> 3872.7200000000003
okay that's not really helping it's

3871.839 --> 3875.2
weird

3872.72 --> 3877.359
i feel very hot but i'm not super sweaty

3875.2 --> 3879.5989999999997
as usual i don't know why that is

3877.359 --> 3881.92
i think it probably is not as hot it's

3879.599 --> 3884.96
just more moist

3881.92 --> 3888.64
let me check the temperature

3884.96 --> 3895.839
yeah it's 28 degrees so it's definitely

3888.64 --> 3895.839
not as hot as it was before

3897.119 --> 3901.52
ah it seems like it's gonna cool down

3899.839 --> 3903.599
further

3901.52 --> 3905.0389999999998
it's actually kind of nice although yeah

3903.599 --> 3909.839
it's more moist

3905.039 --> 3909.8390000000004
humidity level is 54 right now

3917.039 --> 3922.7200000000003
pseudoscience is criminal not

3920.839 --> 3926.88
necessarily

3922.72 --> 3929.68
it's just that when pseudoscience is

3926.88 --> 3929.6800000000003
enforced

3930.16 --> 3939.44
somehow that's criminal

3936.319 --> 3941.92
but yeah technically

3939.44 --> 3943.359
peer pressure and just bullshitting

3941.92 --> 3946.48
people

3943.359 --> 3946.48
that's not forcing

3948.72 --> 3953.9199999999996
you might feel very forced you might

3951.76 --> 3955.92
fall for it

3953.92 --> 3958.16
technically that's not forcing you know

3955.92 --> 3965.839
it's only when like yeah people start to

3958.16 --> 3965.839
get arrested or something

3966.48 --> 3971.599
and the problem though is that with the

3968.799 --> 3973.68
mega corporations if they conspire it's

3971.599 --> 3975.44
almost like government censorship maybe

3973.68 --> 3977.2799999999997
even worse

3975.44 --> 3979.119
and because they're private companies

3977.28 --> 3980.88
they think that they can do whatever the

3979.119 --> 3983.44
[ __ ] they want without caring about

3980.88 --> 3987.44
anybody's rights

3983.44 --> 3988.7200000000003
but is that really true

3987.44 --> 3993.839
that's something that needs to be

3988.72 --> 3993.839
figured out again

3994.559 --> 3999.039
no ragnar stephan halderson we don't

3996.88 --> 4000.7200000000003
need more than what tony did it's a

3999.039 --> 4006.3190000000004
repeatable experiment

4000.72 --> 4009.52
anyone can do it and it works

4006.319 --> 4012.4
independent variable is varied

4009.52 --> 4013.0389999999998
by ensuring through the adding of the

4012.4 --> 4016.48
salt

4013.039 --> 4021.44
that the medium the egg is in becomes

4016.48 --> 4025.039
denser as a result the egg will displace

4021.44 --> 4026.96
upward because its density

4025.039 --> 4028.48
has remained the same while the density

4026.96 --> 4034.079
is in

4028.48 --> 4037.359
is greater so it goes upward

4034.079 --> 4040.96
it's that simple that's your proof

4037.359 --> 4041.7599999999998
it's a repeatable proof you can test it

4040.96 --> 4045.2
yourself

4041.76 --> 4048.559
it's scientific deal with it

4045.2 --> 4050.48
or maybe you could try to disprove

4048.559 --> 4052.559
the hypothesis why don't you try that

4050.48 --> 4053.039
it's not like nobody has ever tried that

4052.559 --> 4055.8390000000004
before

4053.039 --> 4056.7990000000004
right some really ridiculous attempts

4055.839 --> 4060.0
and then

4056.799 --> 4062.319
ideas about oh it's relative density of

4060.0 --> 4062.72
the relative direction so why doesn't it

4062.319 --> 4066.0
go

4062.72 --> 4068.3999999999996
that way no no

4066.0 --> 4070.16
it's definitely these ways these are the

4068.4 --> 4072.2400000000002
directions

4070.16 --> 4074.0789999999997
has nothing to do with the relative it's

4072.24 --> 4077.2
not a relative direction

4074.079 --> 4080.2400000000002
a relative is the relation

4077.2 --> 4082.64
between the object and the medium that's

4080.24 --> 4084.799
the relative part that's the specific

4082.64 --> 4086.8799999999997
relative part because there is no anchor

4084.799 --> 4090.079
point there is no anchor value

4086.88 --> 4092.319
it's purely relative

4090.079 --> 4094.079
density of the object density of the

4092.319 --> 4098.159
medium nothing else matters

4094.079 --> 4100.56
nothing that's what causes the effect

4098.159 --> 4101.759
if you alter either one of them if you

4100.56 --> 4104.88
alter the density

4101.759 --> 4108.799
of either the medium or the objects

4104.88 --> 4110.88
the displacement rate the equilibrium

4108.799 --> 4112.0
this equilibrium will change because

4110.88 --> 4115.12
that's how it works

4112.0 --> 4117.759
it's repeatable science

4115.12 --> 4120.719
deal with it i don't give a [ __ ] if it's

4117.759 --> 4120.719
peer reviewed

4122.4 --> 4127.3589999999995
[ __ ] sake doesn't mean anything

4128.4 --> 4133.04
stupid institutionalized crap if you're

4131.6 --> 4135.6
gonna hold on to that you're

4133.04 --> 4137.759
literally just a priesthood per you're

4135.6 --> 4139.120000000001
you're a science priesthood follower

4137.759 --> 4147.839
that's the only thing that means

4139.12 --> 4147.839
anything to you

4152.4 --> 4156.719
you're not a flat earther as far as i'm

4154.159 --> 4156.719
concerned

4158.48 --> 4165.678999999999
i don't know if you are

4161.759 --> 4165.679
you don't seem to behave like one at all

4167.04 --> 4170.799
oh you're a flat earther now are you

4172.839 --> 4175.839
okay

4176.719 --> 4188.2390000000005
good on you it's taken its time

4180.719 --> 4191.679
better late than never

4188.239 --> 4194.959999999999
yeah good servant a pair of you a scam

4191.679 --> 4198.56
peer review was originally an idea

4194.96 --> 4199.6
to get a in a time where a lot of people

4198.56 --> 4203.1990000000005
were working on

4199.6 --> 4206.56
knowledge and figuring things out

4203.199 --> 4210.159
experimental times then peer review

4206.56 --> 4214.0
is a good idea in order to

4210.159 --> 4217.04
clear up quickly what our scam artist

4214.0 --> 4220.48
just straight away and what are serious

4217.04 --> 4222.8
projects in science syrian scientists

4220.48 --> 4225.12
that's what where it's good at but yeah

4222.8 --> 4226.4800000000005
then an institution got control of it

4225.12 --> 4229.5199999999995
and started to introduce

4226.48 --> 4230.0
pseudoscience as a new standard and then

4229.52 --> 4233.120000000001
sadly

4230.0 --> 4235.44
it's just a then the peer review system

4233.12 --> 4238.5599999999995
becomes just appointed people

4235.44 --> 4239.44
have agreed to be part of upholding that

4238.56 --> 4241.1990000000005
system

4239.44 --> 4243.04
that are just going to determine what is

4241.199 --> 4246.239
good and what is not

4243.04 --> 4247.6
not actually peer reviewing it according

4246.239 --> 4250.718999999999
to scientific standards

4247.6 --> 4251.52
but according to their story telling

4250.719 --> 4255.199
tradition

4251.52 --> 4258.64
standards does it fit

4255.199 --> 4262.0
is it viable for the story continuation

4258.64 --> 4262.0
yeah that's peer review now

4262.64 --> 4273.84
it used to be a very good idea

4275.6 --> 4281.280000000001
yeah or asking for proof of a claim

4278.0 --> 4281.28
director stefan holderson

4283.84 --> 4290.719
somebody makes a claim and you ask

4286.88 --> 4290.719
them to provide the evidence

4295.44 --> 4299.759999999999
and could you please not group us

4298.64 --> 4302.08
together

4299.76 --> 4303.360000000001
as and then start telling what we have

4302.08 --> 4307.28
to do please

4303.36 --> 4309.28
i know exactly what i have to do if you

4307.28 --> 4312.32
realize what you have to do then please

4309.28 --> 4312.32
just address that

4312.64 --> 4329.84
basically you're to yourself and not we

4315.36 --> 4329.839999999999
thank you very much

4338.719 --> 4342.08
hmm really more color

4342.36 --> 4347.44
unrepreducible

4345.36 --> 4349.679
you mean that they don't have any

4347.44 --> 4352.32
science in them

4349.679 --> 4355.04
is that that would make more sense if

4352.32 --> 4357.12
that's what you say

4355.04 --> 4360.159
right because hey if if you have no

4357.12 --> 4362.64
experiment if you have no

4360.159 --> 4363.759999999999
hypotheses in which you are varying and

4362.64 --> 4366.88
manipulating

4363.76 --> 4367.6
the presumed cause of an effect yeah

4366.88 --> 4371.84
then

4367.6 --> 4371.84
it's not really a scientific paper

4372.4 --> 4380.96
so 70 percent makes sense

4377.12 --> 4384.239
you know like science is not

4380.96 --> 4387.36
applicable to everything some things you

4384.239 --> 4390.159
can figure out you can know

4387.36 --> 4392.4
without applying science because not

4390.159 --> 4397.36
everything is variable manipulatable

4392.4 --> 4399.199
some things are just always there

4397.36 --> 4401.44
and they're cyclical and you can figure

4399.199 --> 4404.5599999999995
out the patterns and

4401.44 --> 4406.48
yeah you can measure things but that's

4404.56 --> 4409.280000000001
not science

4406.48 --> 4410.5599999999995
science is speci specifically about

4409.28 --> 4414.0
determining

4410.56 --> 4416.2390000000005
the cause of an effect a natural

4414.0 --> 4418.88
phenomena

4416.239 --> 4418.879999999999
phenomenon

4424.84 --> 4429.6
replication crisis what's that

4432.64 --> 4437.52
no you don't you don't ragnar stefan

4436.8 --> 4440.400000000001
helderson

4437.52 --> 4441.84
you literally what just i'm gonna get

4440.4 --> 4445.36
really pissed off here

4441.84 --> 4447.1990000000005
okay i can measure yeah 9.8 meters per

4445.36 --> 4450.0
second square on earth we need to

4447.199 --> 4452.639999999999
explain this on our flat earth no

4450.0 --> 4454.4
it's relative density this equilibrium

4452.64 --> 4458.64
force i already told you

4454.4 --> 4461.599999999999
it's explained it's right there

4458.64 --> 4464.320000000001
that's it there is your explanation

4461.6 --> 4467.120000000001
relative density this equilibrium force

4464.32 --> 4469.28
is the explanation is the cause of the

4467.12 --> 4474.0
acceleration

4469.28 --> 4474.0
it's explained can you please stop it

4480.84 --> 4483.84
now

4494.4 --> 4500.0
okay this is new replication crisis okay

4497.92 --> 4503.1990000000005
that's an interesting link

4500.0 --> 4503.84
they literally say that it's about 2020

4503.199 --> 4506.32
pretty much

4503.84 --> 4506.32
bizarre

4508.08 --> 4514.8
although it was coined in 2010

4511.52 --> 4517.280000000001
so it's basically a pseudoscience crisis

4514.8 --> 4520.320000000001
that's literally what it is a pseudo

4517.28 --> 4520.32
science crisis

4521.92 --> 4527.679
or baseless assertion replication

4525.12 --> 4527.679
crisis

4528.719 --> 4539.84
the great assertion

4544.64 --> 4548.64
can you please stop addressing us as a

4547.679 --> 4551.04
singular

4548.64 --> 4553.92
group regner stefan halderson i don't

4551.04 --> 4553.92
appreciate that

4560.64 --> 4565.52
i might have just coined that coined

4563.199 --> 4569.12
what

4565.52 --> 4569.120000000001
the pseudoscience crisis

4571.12 --> 4586.5599999999995
or the great assertion sure

4581.11 --> 4595.839999999999
[Music]

4586.56 --> 4595.84
and just type it out

4596.56 --> 4599.709000000001
[Music]

4606.84 --> 4609.84
um

4623.84 --> 4629.28
it's interesting the replication crisis

4625.92 --> 4631.52
i'm gonna post that one in the

4629.28 --> 4632.5599999999995
in the ball bosses chat that's genuinely

4631.52 --> 4633.84
interesting

4632.56 --> 4651.84
[Music]

4633.84 --> 4651.84
thank you for bringing that out

4656.0 --> 4659.92
all right yeah martin tolberg it all

4658.0 --> 4663.6
depends on the power

4659.92 --> 4666.64
behind the water what i can

4663.6 --> 4669.4400000000005
get up pretty incredibly high

4666.64 --> 4671.76
although at some point if you just exert

4669.44 --> 4673.759999999999
too much force on it

4671.76 --> 4676.400000000001
it'll actually just kind of start to

4673.76 --> 4676.400000000001
explode

4676.84 --> 4680.2390000000005
it'll yeah

4686.88 --> 4690.96
no george sanford i think he means out

4690.159 --> 4693.92
in the open

4690.96 --> 4695.52
as a beam now of course water can be

4693.92 --> 4699.36
very high up

4695.52 --> 4702.8
it means like once you release it as a

4699.36 --> 4706.4
as a beam of water like in a fountain

4702.8 --> 4708.88
then 10 meters usually after 10 meters

4706.4 --> 4710.639999999999
it'll probably will go down

4708.88 --> 4712.08
but i don't think that's the maximum it

4710.64 --> 4715.280000000001
all really depends on

4712.08 --> 4715.28
like the design of things

4716.239 --> 4719.36
there's all kinds of weird things you

4717.6 --> 4720.08
can do with the waters you know they

4719.36 --> 4722.719
have these

4720.08 --> 4724.32
bizarre fountains where they just fire

4722.719 --> 4727.199
off controlled

4724.32 --> 4728.239
beams that are then caught just like

4727.199 --> 4731.36
that

4728.239 --> 4733.04
and they don't lose a droplet it's

4731.36 --> 4736.08
all kinds of weird things that can be

4733.04 --> 4738.32
done with water like that

4736.08 --> 4739.76
the water squirting technology has

4738.32 --> 4743.36
become pretty advanced

4739.76 --> 4744.08
let's just say it like that i bet they

4743.36 --> 4749.839999999999
could get it

4744.08 --> 4749.84
up much higher than 10 meters

4768.56 --> 4770.96
okay

4774.0 --> 4777.84
oh really

4778.65 --> 4783.28
[Music]

4780.64 --> 4783.280000000001
i think that

4786.08 --> 4791.84
we'll see

4794.8 --> 4797.84
yeah i don't think so

4801.6 --> 4805.84
that's the troll again

4818.239 --> 4823.28
okay martin told work well some actual

4820.239 --> 4823.28
proof would be great

4825.52 --> 4833.84
oh goodbye

4844.84 --> 4847.84
hmm

4858.84 --> 4863.679
anyway you need a temporary wrench

4865.12 --> 4869.599999999999
well you know what dude you've been

4867.44 --> 4873.04
around for a long time i think i can

4869.6 --> 4876.2390000000005
trust you enough with them with a wrench

4873.04 --> 4876.239
probably some others too

4878.0 --> 4884.0
oh god roger mc

4881.36 --> 4885.44
just had to reify his reification

4884.0 --> 4887.44
fallacy of gravity

4885.44 --> 4889.199
what's wrong with it except everything

4887.44 --> 4892.4
i've explained and talked about

4889.199 --> 4903.839999999999
which you very conveniently ignored

4892.4 --> 4903.839999999999
to the full extent yeah

4928.08 --> 4932.159
yeah i'm giving eyes wet shot a wrench

4942.84 --> 4949.28
too

4945.44 --> 4949.28
yeah most of the rest already have one

4949.679 --> 4956.8
a seeking star wars yeah yeah

4953.12 --> 4958.0
you know once i just really recognize

4956.8 --> 4960.8
the names and don't have any

4958.0 --> 4961.52
bad associations with those names in any

4960.8 --> 4962.96
way

4961.52 --> 4964.4800000000005
at some point you're just going to get a

4962.96 --> 4966.96
wrench when i just spread around

4964.48 --> 4966.959999999999
wrenches

4968.159 --> 4974.32
so anyway hey

4972.6 --> 4976.0
drunkenbullet411 what have you missed

4974.32 --> 4986.799999999999
well the entire show because i kind of

4976.0 --> 4989.28
was about to round out the show

4986.8 --> 4989.28
cookies

4999.36 --> 5002.32
you were okay

5012.639 --> 5018.32
yeah i don't think so right now stephan

5014.32 --> 5018.32
hardison i don't think so

5019.92 --> 5024.4
now do you have only pretty much freshly

5022.4 --> 5026.48
been unbanned by me

5024.4 --> 5028.48
because of some previous behavior and

5026.48 --> 5030.5599999999995
it's good to see you back

5028.48 --> 5032.718999999999
but you're not getting a wrench just yet

5030.56 --> 5033.280000000001
and especially now that you're asking

5032.719 --> 5036.0
for it

5033.28 --> 5037.44
it's very unlikely you're ever going to

5036.0 --> 5043.84
get one

5037.44 --> 5043.839999999999
because that's in the rules

5050.96 --> 5054.32
wait where are the rules

5054.4 --> 5059.5199999999995
where's the rest of the text where's my

5056.88 --> 5059.52
chat rules

5068.84 --> 5074.96
what

5070.719 --> 5077.199
what okay

5074.96 --> 5079.12
okay i don't know why but my chat rules

5077.199 --> 5080.48
are certainly not in the description box

5079.12 --> 5084.96
anymore

5080.48 --> 5087.919999999999
since when does that happen

5084.96 --> 5088.4800000000005
ah i got a lot to fix up until i get my

5087.92 --> 5099.84
show

5088.48 --> 5099.839999999999
yeah back to the old ways again

5100.32 --> 5103.92
yeah hey jam sorry but with all the

5102.159 --> 5105.92
squirt talk coming out of you

5103.92 --> 5113.84
on a daily basis i'm not giving you a

5105.92 --> 5113.84
wrench for a while

5116.4 --> 5121.599999999999
no but guys you do know if you paid

5119.52 --> 5122.96
enough attention you know that i do have

5121.6 --> 5126.719
chat rules

5122.96 --> 5127.04
you don't ask for a wrench you don't go

5126.719 --> 5129.84
in

5127.04 --> 5131.76
with sock accounts to go come back

5129.84 --> 5133.360000000001
anyway after you've been banned because

5131.76 --> 5135.92
then you're probably never going to be

5133.36 --> 5135.92
unbanned

5136.239 --> 5142.959999999999
and yeah

5139.36 --> 5146.159
just if you have a wrench

5142.96 --> 5147.04
don't just start timing out people

5146.159 --> 5149.92
because

5147.04 --> 5152.48
they're saying something wrong or you or

5149.92 --> 5155.76
even if there's a slightly mean

5152.48 --> 5160.159
only do it per default if they're really

5155.76 --> 5161.92
brazenly attacking in a nasty way or if

5160.159 --> 5164.239
they're troll spamming or if they're

5161.92 --> 5168.159
saying disgusting things

5164.239 --> 5170.638999999999
that's the rules and i'll take care of

5168.159 --> 5170.638999999999
the rest

5170.88 --> 5174.719
because i prefer yeah unless you

5172.96 --> 5175.36
absolutely know it it's like a sock

5174.719 --> 5177.28
troll

5175.36 --> 5178.48
and i'll give instructions on the spot

5177.28 --> 5181.759999999999
if they're in there trying that i'll

5178.48 --> 5184.08
tell you okay this guy bam

5181.76 --> 5188.0
other than that i'd like to basically

5184.08 --> 5197.84
keep the banning under in my own hand

5188.0 --> 5197.84
take keep for responsibility for that

5202.8 --> 5206.4800000000005
you don't need one your car works fine

5208.84 --> 5211.84
