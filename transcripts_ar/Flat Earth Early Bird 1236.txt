a couple of fluffy clouds seems to be

140.959 --> 147.52
just very little wind or

143.599 --> 147.51999999999998
when there is wind it's kind of slow

147.76 --> 151.28
and it's just nice and warm

153.68 --> 159.519
a lot of people are enjoying

157.04 --> 162.0
this saturday afternoon

159.519 --> 162.0
i bet

162.56 --> 167.519

185.599 --> 192.319
what's first in chat

188.56 --> 192.319
shitty rainy morning here oh

193.2 --> 195.44
hmm

195.599 --> 201.11999999999998
well there is a lot of moist in the air

203.76 --> 209.67999999999998
well it's 21 degrees celsius

206.959 --> 212.68
53 humidity and there is some

209.68 --> 212.68
participation

216.64 --> 219.44
so i guess

219.68 --> 223.20000000000002
you got

221.12 --> 226.36
not so good weather

223.2 --> 226.35999999999999
oh well

235.84 --> 238.84
hmm

241.519 --> 247.08
right nephew sounds like typical spring

244.08 --> 247.08
weather

251.36 --> 254.479
[Music]

262.32 --> 267.36
yeah we do need to rain it's good to

264.0 --> 267.36
have rain every now and then

267.84 --> 271.03999999999996
just not all the time

276.16 --> 283.84000000000003
what's west virginia oh

279.759 --> 283.84000000000003
hey nathan oakley 1980 good to see you

295.44 --> 299.12
jeff gassett

297.55 --> 301.36
[Music]

299.12 --> 301.36
right

303.36 --> 309.039
did i already mention it it's saturday

305.44 --> 310.8
the 7th of may 2022

309.039 --> 311.759
if not

310.8 --> 314.0
then i'm

311.759 --> 316.32
just did it

314.0 --> 316.32
ah

316.479 --> 319.479
right

327.6 --> 332.12
right so overall i'm doing pretty good

338.96 --> 343.919
i fear though that maybe another filling

341.52 --> 346.24
is starting to crumble

343.919 --> 347.919
so yeah it's gonna reach a point

346.24 --> 349.759
somewhere where i really like have to go

347.919 --> 352.79999999999995
to the dentist just to kind of fix

349.759 --> 353.84000000000003
things up

352.8 --> 356.56
or

353.84 --> 359.86999999999995
see if i can ride it out without like

356.56 --> 363.009
causing some kind of an incident

359.87 --> 363.009
[Music]

363.199 --> 367.28000000000003
i mean

364.479 --> 369.28
i had a giant bucket of money then

367.28 --> 371.52
i'd probably just do that right away and

369.28 --> 374.63899999999995
get it over with then i don't have to

371.52 --> 375.68
worry about it anymore

374.639 --> 380.319
but

375.68 --> 381.17
yeah for now that's not really an option

380.319 --> 382.72
but

381.17 --> 385.03900000000004
[Music]

382.72 --> 385.03900000000004
uh

389.84 --> 394.19899999999996
great flat earth debate yesterday

396.0 --> 401.84
very long

398.96 --> 401.84
the way i like it

402.479 --> 409.36
more easter talk

405.52 --> 410.4
but really in depth and

409.36 --> 412.24
yeah

410.4 --> 414.479
it's just good to go through that all

412.24 --> 416.319
and cross reference it with the way that

414.479 --> 419.44
i've explained it

416.319 --> 421.759
and yeah it seems to match so

419.44 --> 424.4
it's good right this is the next

421.759 --> 428.24
aberration all the flat earthers are

424.4 --> 430.56
being confronted with especially through

428.24 --> 434.0
the crowd that also makes these movies

430.56 --> 434.0
like level and next level

434.84 --> 439.52
and so yeah this is the new thing to

437.52 --> 443.639
deal with this is what everybody now

439.52 --> 443.639
likes to get hung up on

458.639 --> 460.96000000000004
right

463.68 --> 469.36
uh yeah i was also watching own benjamin

467.12 --> 471.759
who's apparently done like a

469.36 --> 473.44
face-to-face live stream

471.759 --> 476.0
this morning guy

473.44 --> 477.52
that started at rockfin that started the

476.0 --> 479.919
incident

477.52 --> 481.75899999999996
try to talk it out

479.919 --> 484.24
damn

481.759 --> 484.24
i mean

488.08 --> 495.52
things i could say about that

490.8 --> 498.639
holy [ __ ] but yeah that's let's just say

495.52 --> 501.68
own benjamin kind of called it

498.639 --> 504.16
even with his response cartoon too that

501.68 --> 505.44
caused the incident like what he made

504.16 --> 508.56
afterward

505.44 --> 511.199
the representation of rockfin as ira

508.56 --> 513.84
like holy [ __ ] and he this guy doesn't

511.199 --> 513.84
even know it

513.919 --> 518.959
i think he's like a techie

516.399 --> 521.2
that's what i think i think the guy is

518.959 --> 523.5989999999999
really good with like understanding how

521.2 --> 525.12
computers work and how to fix things and

523.599 --> 527.12
it's like soup

525.12 --> 529.49
he's like a grease monkey with with

527.12 --> 531.2
computers

529.49 --> 533.04
[Music]

531.2 --> 535.36
but

533.04 --> 537.04
he doesn't really have seems to have a

535.36 --> 540.399
lot of like

537.04 --> 542.399
fractal oversight ability

540.399 --> 544.8
so he's just constantly

542.399 --> 546.959
juggling with like policies because he

544.8 --> 550.3199999999999
just doesn't understand what's going on

546.959 --> 552.64
about a lot of the comedy

550.32 --> 553.7600000000001
like the philosophy about it doesn't get

552.64 --> 556.3199999999999
it

553.76 --> 558.399
and that really stood out to me with

556.32 --> 560.48
that video

558.399 --> 563.68
i wonder if you guys think the same or

560.48 --> 566.8000000000001
you think i'm just

563.68 --> 569.92
overblowing things

566.8 --> 569.92
so i'll link you up

573.04 --> 578.48
so you can make up your own mind

576.64 --> 582.08
on your own time though

578.48 --> 583.519
it is a 52 minute interview i'm i got to

582.08 --> 585.76
like

583.519 --> 586.8
40 minutes

585.76 --> 589.4399999999999
enough

586.8 --> 591.5999999999999
to draw that conclusion i think owens

589.44 --> 594.48
also drawn his own conclusions i mean

591.6 --> 595.839
the guy is a real

594.48 --> 598.16
diplomat

595.839 --> 601.839
when he needs to be

598.16 --> 601.8389999999999
but like he knows

602.56 --> 605.8389999999999
he knows he call it

611.99 --> 619.04
[Music]

617.04 --> 622.3199999999999
anyway

619.04 --> 622.3199999999999
that was kind of interesting

629.36 --> 632.6800000000001
what else

643.68 --> 648.64
oh no i missed a flat arthur stream

649.279 --> 653.2
there were a lot of different streams

650.88 --> 656.16
but it was not super

653.2 --> 656.1600000000001
engaged with it

657.04 --> 660.519
what was that doing

660.72 --> 665.6800000000001
oh yeah i was i watched a little series

663.279 --> 666.88
that adam meekin recommended to me on

665.68 --> 669.5999999999999
netflix

666.88 --> 671.6
very short

669.6 --> 673.44
comedy

671.6 --> 676.32
and conspiracy

673.44 --> 676.32
and it was like

677.56 --> 682.959
[Music]

680.56 --> 685.1999999999999
it was kind of funny in there but also

682.959 --> 685.1999999999999
like

686.88 --> 692.079
it didn't make a lot of sense now

688.64 --> 695.12
whether it was doing that on purpose

692.079 --> 697.3599999999999
or could it comedic purposes

695.12 --> 701.36
or whether it really didn't

697.36 --> 702.48
have a bigger story to tell i'm not sure

701.36 --> 704.88
what's the

702.48 --> 707.12
the pentavarite

704.88 --> 710.24
about a supposed good

707.12 --> 713.04
mini little secret society

710.24 --> 713.04
it's but it's

715.2 --> 721.519
it's a bit squirty but it's because it's

718.16 --> 723.68
it's like a follow-up of austin powers

721.519 --> 725.6
it's the same actor he's he's a lot

723.68 --> 727.4399999999999
older now it took me some time to even

725.6 --> 728.88
recognize him

727.44 --> 730.8000000000001
he plays this

728.88 --> 734.639
canadian

730.8 --> 736.3199999999999
media guy very nice like super ultra

734.639 --> 738.88
good guy

736.32 --> 740.72
but really well executed like i mean the

738.88 --> 742.639
guy is a pretty good actor

740.72 --> 745.519
he's very convincing has a lot of spirit

742.639 --> 747.6
he pours into his character

745.519 --> 750.079
but yeah there are a lot of naughty

747.6 --> 753.279
things also but yeah it's yeah

750.079 --> 755.92
conspiracy and like ooh orgies and

753.279 --> 758.639
not super overt but it is

755.92 --> 761.1999999999999
i did think like uh yeah that's a bit

758.639 --> 761.2
squirty

762.16 --> 765.6
but

763.36 --> 765.6
yeah

765.68 --> 769.88
that's what i was also watching

773.279 --> 778.639
hey random explorer long time no see

776.079 --> 778.6389999999999
good to see you

778.959 --> 783.279
finally catching the live show again all

781.04 --> 783.279
right

784.88 --> 788.0
mike myers

791.2 --> 794.5600000000001
what are you talking about dominoid

794.88 --> 799.4399999999999
is that like the producer of

797.6 --> 801.3000000000001
what i was talking about i didn't even

799.44 --> 804.45
look it up

801.3 --> 804.4499999999999
[Music]

804.48 --> 808.5600000000001
i mean i was left with a bit of feeling

807.04 --> 811.279
like that

808.56 --> 814.399
it wasn't super impressive in ways it

811.279 --> 816.72
also the way like it ended just was like

814.399 --> 819.04
almost like it was rush rush to be

816.72 --> 820.88
discontinued or something i don't know

819.04 --> 823.12
there's something weird about the whole

820.88 --> 823.12
thing

824.079 --> 828.4799999999999
i was not overly fond of the naughty

826.72 --> 831.1990000000001
conspiracy guy

828.48 --> 831.1990000000001
at the start

832.639 --> 836.5600000000001
but i did like the main character

834.639 --> 839.199
because he was just so freaking nice and

836.56 --> 841.5189999999999
totally in over his head but he's just

839.199 --> 844.639
always just doing his best like he was a

841.519 --> 847.04
champion that was in over his head

844.639 --> 849.279
and his ultimate power was being a good

847.04 --> 849.279
guy

850.16 --> 855.3199999999999
and that was interesting but the rest

856.8 --> 860.56
that's the actor's name oh right

860.959 --> 864.0
i didn't know that

867.199 --> 872.639
trailer looked yeah but it is cringy

869.12 --> 874.0
tomorrow the whole thing is cringy

872.639 --> 877.44
and it's almost like doing that on

874.0 --> 880.079
purpose it is also like hard criticism

877.44 --> 882.32
probably from an honest perspective

880.079 --> 886.16
on how

882.32 --> 888.24
crazy conspiracy thinking people get

886.16 --> 889.36
there's like some actual dialogue about

888.24 --> 893.36
that

889.36 --> 895.44
and it's not like oh cnn being super

893.36 --> 898.399
arrogant or something like that level no

895.44 --> 902.0790000000001
it is kind of honest criticism and a bit

898.399 --> 904.32
of a warning sign and then yeah

902.079 --> 904.3199999999999
right

904.56 --> 909.1199999999999
the whole thing all together is just

906.639 --> 909.12
kind of like

910.959 --> 913.279
this is

913.839 --> 917.12
like

914.8 --> 917.92
it ended at some point and i was like

917.12 --> 920.079
wait

917.92 --> 921.4399999999999
that's it

920.079 --> 922.88
uh

921.44 --> 925.12
what

922.88 --> 926.56
i just felt flustered like what just

925.12 --> 929.36
happened

926.56 --> 932.0
watched six episodes apparently but like

929.36 --> 934.32
what just happened

932.0 --> 934.32
weird

937.279 --> 941.24
should have stuck with greensboro

942.16 --> 947.4399999999999
i thought that the austin power series

944.32 --> 951.12
was really awesome actually it's

947.44 --> 953.1990000000001
silly and stupid but it's also brilliant

951.12 --> 955.68
i really like those movies i didn't like

953.199 --> 957.92
them when they came out

955.68 --> 960.4799999999999
but afterward

957.92 --> 962.8
after kind of like the feeling of

960.48 --> 964.48
annoying especially when everybody

962.8 --> 967.12
thought it was funny that's annoying

964.48 --> 968.88
right but when that kind of stopped

967.12 --> 972.5600000000001
took an honest look i thought that's

968.88 --> 972.56
actually really funny

972.639 --> 977.6800000000001
and like creative

975.68 --> 978.959
so

977.68 --> 980.959
i i do

978.959 --> 983.8389999999999
kind of have an appreciation for his

980.959 --> 983.8389999999999
work

984.24 --> 987.6800000000001
wayne's worlds i

989.44 --> 995.519
i never really liked it too much

993.68 --> 997.68
it's just

995.519 --> 999.279
i was just

997.68 --> 1001.7589999999999
it was happening

999.279 --> 1004.24
it was a thing i just went the other

1001.759 --> 1006.9590000000001
direction as i typically do i just

1004.24 --> 1006.9590000000001
didn't really

1008.16 --> 1011.8389999999999
it just felt too sheepish to me

1019.839 --> 1024.959
but i do maybe if i like watch it back

1022.72 --> 1028.559
and they might have all these kind of

1024.959 --> 1030.959
little trinkets in there too now

1028.559 --> 1034.6399999999999
because i i just never really stuck to

1030.959 --> 1036.88
watch it and i'm just always like oh

1034.64 --> 1039.6000000000001
like these are guys i don't wanna hang

1036.88 --> 1042.64
around with i'm sorry i really wouldn't

1039.6 --> 1042.6399999999999
i don't like that

1048.0 --> 1052.88
anyway

1050.32 --> 1055.52
the pentath it was kind of funny but it

1052.88 --> 1058.0800000000002
was weird

1055.52 --> 1060.559
not as in spooky weird but like bit

1058.08 --> 1062.0
flustering like what

1060.559 --> 1064.32
what

1062.0 --> 1064.32
okay

1069.36 --> 1072.9599999999998
so i watched that also

1075.2 --> 1077.52
uh

1078.48 --> 1082.08
a clutch by the way

1080.48 --> 1084.16
pga cnet

1082.08 --> 1087.1599999999999
tomonoi 2.

1084.16 --> 1087.16
uh

1097.28 --> 1100.72
which went well it's in him away camera

1099.2 --> 1103.679
it's not really that

1100.72 --> 1103.679
but it isn't

1104.48 --> 1109.84
like that [ __ ] is only funny when ever

1107.039 --> 1111.76
when everybody's in a bus

1109.84 --> 1114.1599999999999
like either you have to be like drunk or

1111.76 --> 1117.2
something with the guys then it might

1114.16 --> 1119.52
suddenly be really funny again

1117.2 --> 1121.76
or yeah in the time when it was really

1119.52 --> 1123.9189999999999
hyped up then it becomes funny it's just

1121.76 --> 1126.559
contagious then but

1123.919 --> 1129.6000000000001
when you just look at it as a dry thing

1126.559 --> 1132.8799999999999
it's not really that funny it only works

1129.6 --> 1135.84
if you're if you have a bus

1132.88 --> 1138.48
which well i guess teenagers have that a

1135.84 --> 1138.48
lot more

1138.559 --> 1141.44
just naturally

1142.4 --> 1148.2800000000002
because of the hormones and [ __ ]

1145.28 --> 1148.28
anyway

1158.61 --> 1161.83
[Music]

1170.08 --> 1175.52
right so yeah

1172.08 --> 1175.52
what do you guys want to talk about

1175.919 --> 1178.48
other than

1177.44 --> 1182.2
yeah

1178.48 --> 1182.2

1206.159 --> 1210.72
any more feedback on

1209.12 --> 1213.84
at the next level

1210.72 --> 1213.84
anybody else watch it

1215.84 --> 1220.1999999999998
i i kind of reviewed it yesterday

1222.08 --> 1226.1589999999999
fighting an oculus what why

1226.559 --> 1230.36
what are you gonna do with that

1247.2 --> 1251.52
oh by the way also

1248.88 --> 1251.5200000000002
elise g

1251.6 --> 1254.32
gave me uh

1257.84 --> 1263.1999999999998
showed me around the house with this

1259.679 --> 1266.0
video that he's i guess built or

1263.2 --> 1268.24
redecorated but man this house is

1266.0 --> 1270.559
freaking huge

1268.24 --> 1272.159
it's american size man

1270.559 --> 1274.24
crazy like

1272.159 --> 1276.4
every single room in there is bigger

1274.24 --> 1279.799
than the place that i yeah that i'm

1276.4 --> 1279.799
living in

1290.48 --> 1293.28
video games

1293.679 --> 1298.96
okay

1296.08 --> 1301.12
aren't you afraid he's just gonna

1298.96 --> 1304.28
get stuck

1301.12 --> 1304.28
in there

1313.52 --> 1320.24
i mean just look at what game boys did

1317.36 --> 1322.799
the kids in the 90s

1320.24 --> 1325.36
might want to be a bit careful with

1322.799 --> 1327.2
with inoculus i mean i don't think

1325.36 --> 1329.4399999999998
there's even that many things you can do

1327.2 --> 1330.799
with it still

1329.44 --> 1333.8400000000001
i mean there's more with them when it

1330.799 --> 1333.84
just came out but

1342.96 --> 1347.48
i mean how old is your kid

1360.3 --> 1363.589
[Music]

1364.0 --> 1370.159
ah yeah jeff gas said yeah it is

1366.799 --> 1370.1589999999999
it's it's decent enough

1370.24 --> 1373.36
nine

1371.2 --> 1376.0
oh [ __ ]

1373.36 --> 1376.0
nice

1378.32 --> 1384.24
i mean it's up to you man but i i would

1380.799 --> 1388.12
say that's a little bit young for

1384.24 --> 1388.1200000000001
like 3d goggles

1390.08 --> 1392.48
i mean

1393.28 --> 1398.3999999999999
at that age they should be like focused

1395.84 --> 1400.559
around like

1398.4 --> 1403.2
exploring stuff going around in the

1400.559 --> 1405.84
actual world

1403.2 --> 1407.3600000000001
like as much as possible that's when

1405.84 --> 1409.9189999999999
when you grow

1407.36 --> 1412.0
in that sort of thing in that age if

1409.919 --> 1415.44
they if they get stuck just playing

1412.0 --> 1417.679
video games and not doing anything then

1415.44 --> 1419.44
that's gonna like bite them in the ass

1417.679 --> 1422.88
later in life

1419.44 --> 1422.88
just a fair warning

1423.44 --> 1431.8400000000001
and i was like major league addicted to

1427.12 --> 1431.84
video games as a kid so i i know

1432.559 --> 1436.799
uh like

1434.08 --> 1438.8799999999999
because of that [ __ ]

1436.799 --> 1441.2
because i was so stuck to video games

1438.88 --> 1444.159
already at a young age it really played

1441.2 --> 1446.799
into my fear of socializing that's not

1444.159 --> 1449.919
really helped me

1446.799 --> 1453.12
it's given me like a a big minus on my

1449.919 --> 1456.24
skill range in that department

1453.12 --> 1459.1999999999998
that i've like had to like get surreal

1456.24 --> 1462.64
to even compensate

1459.2 --> 1462.64
to compensate for so

1462.72 --> 1465.72
basically

1466.58 --> 1470.52
[Music]

1472.72 --> 1476.32
right and

1473.76 --> 1478.8799999999999
dude when i was a little kid i was often

1476.32 --> 1480.96
like kind of scared

1478.88 --> 1482.72
like it's in springtime and like all

1480.96 --> 1484.72
that energy and it would be like it's

1482.72 --> 1487.279
too much i don't want it

1484.72 --> 1490.48
but then sometimes i was always so glad

1487.279 --> 1492.72
when my parents did that afterward

1490.48 --> 1496.48
my parents would just be like pushy like

1492.72 --> 1500.24
no go outside right now just go there go

1496.48 --> 1501.919
there walk around look around

1500.24 --> 1503.679
see maybe

1501.919 --> 1505.2
you'll bump into other people in the

1503.679 --> 1506.64
same mood

1505.2 --> 1509.279
get to know them

1506.64 --> 1510.3200000000002
be careful just go on an adventure or

1509.279 --> 1511.679
something

1510.32 --> 1515.84
out there

1511.679 --> 1515.8400000000001
and that would really work for me

1517.36 --> 1522.4799999999998
like at that age

1520.24 --> 1524.0
i mean when you're like a teenager that

1522.48 --> 1526.4
becomes

1524.0 --> 1528.88
sort of risky to do that

1526.4 --> 1531.2
because then there's like sexuality

1528.88 --> 1533.1200000000001
that will get involved and all that and

1531.2 --> 1536.64
like from your impulses

1533.12 --> 1539.1999999999998
but at a really young age like 9 10

1536.64 --> 1541.1200000000001
of the 12 i'd say that's like the the

1539.2 --> 1543.279
best moments to just like

1541.12 --> 1545.12
just go out if it's good weather and all

1543.279 --> 1548.32
that

1545.12 --> 1548.32
go out and explore

1549.12 --> 1552.1589999999999
use your senses

1553.36 --> 1559.039
like your spatial orientation senses and

1556.64 --> 1563.919
just like

1559.039 --> 1563.919
get used to using your senses and like

1565.52 --> 1570.6399999999999
discover all that curiosity that you

1568.48 --> 1572.72
will have when you do that especially

1570.64 --> 1576.0800000000002
when you're a kid it's like

1572.72 --> 1580.48
dude i just walk around sometimes

1576.08 --> 1582.8799999999999
trying to find interesting looking rocks

1580.48 --> 1584.88
and sometimes i'd find like these like

1582.88 --> 1586.7990000000002
crystals it's just like in the middle

1584.88 --> 1589.1200000000001
it's just like wow that's a crystal

1586.799 --> 1591.679
that's fascinating

1589.12 --> 1593.6789999999999
and i'd collect that stuff i also like

1591.679 --> 1597.3600000000001
to like go to

1593.679 --> 1599.679
buy minerals and special rocks

1597.36 --> 1601.76
but sometimes i just like

1599.679 --> 1604.5590000000002
like to wander around and see if i could

1601.76 --> 1607.76
just find it

1604.559 --> 1610.96
it made me like use

1607.76 --> 1614.559
like identifying sensories

1610.96 --> 1614.559
and now i'm good at that

1616.88 --> 1621.7600000000002
because i did that a lot as a kid

1620.4 --> 1624.159
right

1621.76 --> 1626.32
i'm so glad that i got that objective

1624.159 --> 1629.679
like programmed into me early like you

1626.32 --> 1632.0
have to use every like oh people might

1629.679 --> 1634.3200000000002
be like oh you're wasting your time blah

1632.0 --> 1637.039
blah blah you're just a stupid this and

1634.32 --> 1638.8799999999999
that but

1637.039 --> 1640.48
if you just keep the objective in mind

1638.88 --> 1643.0390000000002
that whatever you're doing if you just

1640.48 --> 1646.48
hang around somewhere

1643.039 --> 1649.679
use that time explore your senses like

1646.48 --> 1652.48
figure out everything about yourself

1649.679 --> 1655.279
about your senses about like the things

1652.48 --> 1656.88
around you how does that work

1655.279 --> 1659.36
what does it look like why is this

1656.88 --> 1661.8400000000001
different from that just everything

1659.36 --> 1664.0
and just try to like build something

1661.84 --> 1666.6399999999999
with that by build a framework of

1664.0 --> 1668.64
internal understanding doing that

1666.64 --> 1670.3990000000001
and get used to building that framework

1668.64 --> 1673.6000000000001
and then eventually you can adapt that

1670.399 --> 1673.6
framework to everything

1675.039 --> 1678.64
this is a bit esoteric but

1689.039 --> 1693.039
right i'm not trying to be specific it's

1691.279 --> 1695.6
not like oh walk around collect rocks

1693.039 --> 1699.279
it's special or no it's about the

1695.6 --> 1701.4399999999998
actions it's about the process

1699.279 --> 1703.36
and just that feeling of adventure like

1701.44 --> 1706.159
you never know what you're gonna bump

1703.36 --> 1707.12
into necessarily but you might

1706.159 --> 1710.0800000000002
you will

1707.12 --> 1712.8799999999999
probably try to predict

1710.08 --> 1716.6399999999999
reading the feelings as they come to you

1712.88 --> 1716.64
as you engage in something new

1717.039 --> 1720.799
you can learn all kinds of things just

1719.52 --> 1723.6
doing

1720.799 --> 1725.44
random [ __ ] or seemingly to the outside

1723.6 --> 1728.9599999999998

facebook is horrible yeah no [ __ ]

1814.32 --> 1818.8799999999999
dude i knew it was gonna turn out like

1816.72 --> 1822.0
that because even in the start it

1818.88 --> 1826.3200000000002
already showed like the poisonous seeds

1822.0 --> 1826.32
very early on like what it was gonna do

1826.64 --> 1830.0
i mean

1828.559 --> 1835.12
like even

1830.0 --> 1835.12
the i.t crowd made an episode about

1835.2 --> 1840.32
what face friend is what they call it

1837.76 --> 1843.12
but it is very blatantly about facebook

1840.32 --> 1843.12
and it is like

1843.279 --> 1848.32
a nerd criticism that's real

1846.799 --> 1850.24
like that's

1848.32 --> 1852.24
what is it now a decade ago or something

1850.24 --> 1855.6
that's just ancient

1852.24 --> 1858.559
like they knew i knew

1855.6 --> 1861.36
i knew i was like even with my ex i was

1858.559 --> 1863.6789999999999
like you're not gonna go on facebook

1861.36 --> 1865.519
don't do that

1863.679 --> 1867.6000000000001
and if you decide to do that then don't

1865.519 --> 1870.159
put pictures up there

1867.6 --> 1873.1589999999999
especially you don't put my pictures up

1870.159 --> 1873.159
there

1879.84 --> 1883.279
as i knew it was going to go

1882.0 --> 1885.519
really bad

1883.279 --> 1887.76
it didn't start out great

1885.519 --> 1890.32
but it was sort of free then

1887.76 --> 1893.84
it very quickly transitioned into just

1890.32 --> 1893.84
this covert tyrannical

1895.039 --> 1899.12

1896.64 --> 1901.279

[Music]

2028.72 --> 2033.3600000000001
this thing will have to fall before it

2030.72 --> 2036.159
can be rebuilt

2033.36 --> 2036.1589999999999
what does that mean

2038.159 --> 2042.0800000000002
i mean

2039.919 --> 2045.279
it comes down to that the controllers

2042.08 --> 2047.039
just need to lose control

2045.279 --> 2049.679
but that's not gonna bring the system

2047.039 --> 2052.399
down though it's just gonna rearrange

2049.679 --> 2052.399
the control

2052.8 --> 2059.04
so that things can just work the way

2055.76 --> 2061.679
that where is optimal instead of being

2059.04 --> 2063.679
redirected by these crazy eugenics

2061.679 --> 2065.119
agenda

2063.679 --> 2068.119
people

2065.119 --> 2068.119
right

2074.639 --> 2079.839
i mean i really see it as like okay

2077.52 --> 2081.7599999999998
governments and all that it's really not

2079.839 --> 2084.7999999999997
even that bad it's just the people that

2081.76 --> 2084.8
are abusing it

2085.52 --> 2089.28
and the garbage that they create right

2087.679 --> 2092.56
well

2089.28 --> 2094.8
if they're really stopped

2092.56 --> 2097.04
then it's just a matter of okay get

2094.8 --> 2100.079
people

2097.04 --> 2100.079
that can have like a

2100.24 --> 2106.3199999999997
less ambitious type of government setup

2103.68 --> 2109.5989999999997
that's less invasive

2106.32 --> 2113.28
and then just swipe all the garbage

2109.599 --> 2114.839
in the trash can like all these nonsense

2113.28 --> 2118.48
laws

2114.839 --> 2118.48
just fix that

2118.88 --> 2123.119
it should mostly just be like just

2121.359 --> 2125.7599999999998
throw them in the trash can and there is

2123.119 --> 2128.7200000000003
a previous law that it kind of trumped

2125.76 --> 2130.7200000000003
that it works just fine so

2128.72 --> 2133.68
you don't have to like break down the

2130.72 --> 2135.52
entire system no it's not the system is

2133.68 --> 2137.2
not the problem it's the ones that are

2135.52 --> 2140.7599999999998
using it

2137.2 --> 2140.7599999999998
that are the problem

2146.24 --> 2150.3199999999997
oh government officials are corrupt well

2151.52 --> 2154.16
i don't know

2154.32 --> 2159.76
i think at this point a lot of them are

2157.359 --> 2162.4
yeah

2159.76 --> 2164.8
but a lot of them are also just caught

2162.4 --> 2167.6800000000003
in their own ignorant little world where

2164.8 --> 2170.48
they safe space themselves into like

2167.68 --> 2170.48
isolation

2170.72 --> 2174.72
and they don't really understand

2173.04 --> 2177.7599999999998
the consequences of everything they're

2174.72 --> 2177.7599999999998
doing not really

2179.68 --> 2182.72
but

2181.2 --> 2185.2799999999997
yeah there's always going to be the

2182.72 --> 2186.8799999999997
architects of the actions and they

2185.28 --> 2188.5600000000004
absolutely have to know what they're

2186.88 --> 2191.28
doing

2188.56 --> 2193.359
because they're going to aim for effects

2191.28 --> 2195.92
right but all the participants that are

2193.359 --> 2198.0
executing that are being the faces in

2195.92 --> 2201.44
the government they don't necessarily

2198.0 --> 2204.8
understand that a lot of times they just

2201.44 --> 2207.04
like okay we'll just do whatever you

2204.8 --> 2209.04
whatever the script is please just i

2207.04 --> 2214.52
don't want to know about it's way in

2209.04 --> 2214.52
over my head right that can be there too

2222.88 --> 2228.88
in every heavy corrupted system

2225.92 --> 2232.079
there's always a couple of players

2228.88 --> 2234.6400000000003
usually a relatively small club

2232.079 --> 2237.119
that have consists of people that have a

2234.64 --> 2239.04
lot of influence

2237.119 --> 2242.1600000000003
that do all that

2239.04 --> 2245.68
and the rest is just like

2242.16 --> 2249.2
people that are just working there and

2245.68 --> 2252.2
just trying to fulfill a job function

2249.2 --> 2252.2
really

2258.72 --> 2263.9199999999996
right it's like difference between flat

2261.119 --> 2266.0
or ballers and anti-flat earthers see

2263.92 --> 2268.7200000000003
the government like that right

2266.0 --> 2271.28
so yeah they're all ballers but not all

2268.72 --> 2273.04
of them are anti-flat earthers this is

2271.28 --> 2273.76
not literal this is a metaphor by the

2273.04 --> 2275.68
way

2273.76 --> 2276.96
i'm not saying i don't know

2275.68 --> 2278.8799999999997
maybe that some of them are flat

2276.96 --> 2281.04
earthers i don't know

2278.88 --> 2281.04
but

2282.16 --> 2286.7999999999997
if let's just say they were all ballers

2284.48 --> 2288.48
not all of them are anti-flat earthers

2286.8 --> 2290.6400000000003
but there are some

2288.48 --> 2292.96
and they do like

2290.64 --> 2295.44
manipulate things

2292.96 --> 2297.839
try to steer the ones that aren't like

2295.44 --> 2299.92
in full understanding of what they

2297.839 --> 2303.119
really believe in

2299.92 --> 2305.839
see the government like that

2303.119 --> 2309.6800000000003
right it's not the majority it's never

2305.839 --> 2312.16
the majority like that doesn't work

2309.68 --> 2314.7999999999997
too many people in on the innermost

2312.16 --> 2317.5989999999997
circle will cause

2314.8 --> 2320.8
division and fract like fractal split up

2317.599 --> 2322.6400000000003
is not that would naturally happen right

2320.8 --> 2324.48
that only works when it's completely

2322.64 --> 2327.2
safe and you're in full control and you

2324.48 --> 2328.8
can basically expand the empire

2327.2 --> 2329.68
well they're not in that position right

2328.8 --> 2332.2400000000002
now

2329.68 --> 2332.24
not at all

2332.88 --> 2336.2400000000002
they're actually

2334.24 --> 2339.359
quite surrounded

2336.24 --> 2341.52
and in defensive mode so there's only a

2339.359 --> 2344.48
circle that's going to keep that up

2341.52 --> 2344.48
smaller circle

2345.76 --> 2356.429
that's how i see it

2348.28 --> 2356.429
[Music]

2362.3 --> 2366.059
[Music]

2369.92 --> 2375.52
well yes jeff gas said that is an option

2372.64 --> 2377.1189999999997
to them if we just destroy everything

2375.52 --> 2379.7599999999998
else

2377.119 --> 2382.1600000000003
then they can blame us and then we are

2379.76 --> 2384.079
to blame yeah that's easy right that's

2382.16 --> 2386.7999999999997
why i say

2384.079 --> 2389.2000000000003
even when i go rage when don't just burn

2386.8 --> 2390.0
everything down

2389.2 --> 2393.2
like

2390.0 --> 2395.119
don't just go ballistic and just start

2393.2 --> 2399.1189999999997
killing people or something crazy like

2395.119 --> 2401.119
that right that's just terrible

2399.119 --> 2404.7200000000003
know your enemy no

2401.119 --> 2407.839
no that little circle get real with it

2404.72 --> 2410.0
if you want to get real then get real

2407.839 --> 2411.599
don't go halfway and just blow yourself

2410.0 --> 2413.68
up for nothing

2411.599 --> 2416.6400000000003
right

2413.68 --> 2416.64
that's ridiculous

2421.52 --> 2427.119
if you really want to stop it then the

2423.44 --> 2427.119
circle has to be broken

2431.68 --> 2436.52
that will make them actually lose grip

2438.1 --> 2442.0
[Music]

2439.839 --> 2444.64
if you're just gonna like uh destroy

2442.0 --> 2446.319
like a scratched earth policy

2444.64 --> 2448.7999999999997
for the public against the corrupt

2446.319 --> 2450.96
government doesn't work

2448.8 --> 2453.8390000000004
because technically all that stuff is

2450.96 --> 2453.839
the people's

2454.8 --> 2460.079
it's not the possession of the ones that

2456.8 --> 2460.079
are ruling and corrupt

2460.16 --> 2463.359
you should see it like rather that they

2462.16 --> 2465.2799999999997
stole it

2463.359 --> 2466.7999999999997
and you need to get it back it's not

2465.28 --> 2470.8390000000004
really theirs why the hell would you

2466.8 --> 2470.8390000000004
burn all that down that's ridiculous

2484.6 --> 2487.79

2500.96 --> 2505.68

sabotage

2508.56 --> 2513.319
and

2510.319 --> 2513.319
monstrous

2524.48 --> 2528.079
i mean

2525.68 --> 2530.56
there should be like really

2528.079 --> 2532.8
serious investigations against like who

2530.56 --> 2532.7999999999997
did

2534.839 --> 2540.7999999999997
that i just like who's gonna do that you

2537.76 --> 2542.3190000000004
know that's a bit of a problem

2540.8 --> 2544.7200000000003
because if they're corrupted then what's

2542.319 --> 2544.72
the point

2546.24 --> 2550.9199999999996
hey leg good to see you

2575.68 --> 2578.68
um

2580.06 --> 2583.179

2608.079 --> 2613.28

2610.319 --> 2617.4
engage with this bobby steals guys

this guy come on

[Music]

2647.76 --> 2649.8390000000004
you

2667.04 --> 2671.599

2669.04 --> 2675.079
yeah i agree with clutch

2671.599 --> 2675.079
get in the garden

2680.0 --> 2685.04
i mean rig back seriously like you look

2682.96 --> 2687.599
at what you just said

2685.04 --> 2689.2
right they're hitting us on every level

2687.599 --> 2692.2400000000002
financially mentally spiritually

2689.2 --> 2692.24
physically sexually

2692.8 --> 2696.7200000000003
you said that

2694.56 --> 2701.04
why would you risk

2696.72 --> 2701.04
giving your boy a vr set

2702.16 --> 2706.64
when you know that all that is happening

2710.72 --> 2714.16
that seems like a little

2716.079 --> 2721.599
yeah

2717.28 --> 2721.599
split up consciously like

2723.76 --> 2728.4
are you gonna take all those things

2725.52 --> 2729.92
serious or is it just like platitudes

2728.4 --> 2731.76
and you're squirting

2729.92 --> 2733.839
and you're not really gonna

2731.76 --> 2735.92
stand behind that

2733.839 --> 2740.96
and realize like maybe it's not good to

2735.92 --> 2740.96
get my kid a vr set but instead a garden

2741.52 --> 2745.7599999999998
i mean if he's still interested like

2743.359 --> 2747.44
when he's older then yeah

2745.76 --> 2751.0400000000004
i get it

2747.44 --> 2751.04
but at that young age it's just

2752.72 --> 2761.319
trying to lure him just outdoors and

2756.48 --> 2761.319
doing things with his eyes and his hands

2762.079 --> 2768.5600000000004
get get some dirt on him

2765.28 --> 2768.5600000000004
he'll do him a lot of good

2770.96 --> 2775.119
like even if at first he might think

2773.28 --> 2776.96
like i don't like it if he doesn't you

2775.119 --> 2778.48
have to teach him how to respect all

2776.96 --> 2780.56
that right

2778.48 --> 2782.48
and you have to respect it and then

2780.56 --> 2785.48
chill

2782.48 --> 2785.48
anyway

2822.8 --> 2828.52
oh my gosh you call me a bath that's not

2825.28 --> 2828.52

get some fresh air

2960.0 --> 2962.48
right

2960.96 --> 2965.119
yeah right back

2962.48 --> 2967.52
well a little trick that might help you

2965.119 --> 2970.319
know when i try to be sarcastic or

2967.52 --> 2972.319
quoting somebody else

2970.319 --> 2974.4
i'm not just overtly saying something

2972.319 --> 2976.8
what i like to do sometimes is just put

2974.4 --> 2978.559
the entire sentence

2976.8 --> 2979.92
or the part that is supposed to be

2978.559 --> 2981.599
sarcastic

2979.92 --> 2984.079
within

2981.599 --> 2987.04
uh

2984.079 --> 2987.04
quotation marks

2995.68 --> 2999.839
that

2996.48 --> 3003.2
for me at least like helps identify that

2999.839 --> 3003.2
it is not literal

3003.28 --> 3007.119
it's not just you're just saying it

3005.61 --> 3007.7000000000003
[Music]

3007.119 --> 3011.2000000000003
might help

3007.7 --> 3012.7999999999997
[Music]

3011.2 --> 3015.04
did i listen to bb's stream with

3012.8 --> 3016.7200000000003
christopher gardner yeah big part of it

3015.04 --> 3020.24
yes

3016.72 --> 3022.48
yeah i've seen like christopher garner

3020.24 --> 3024.319
and own benjamin like have streams

3022.48 --> 3027.839
before

3024.319 --> 3027.839
the guy is pretty heavy

3061.96 --> 3065.15
[Music]

3075.52 --> 3079.28
yeah but it's interesting because that

3077.599 --> 3080.839
christopher gardner is one of the people

3079.28 --> 3082.559
out there

3080.839 --> 3086.24
that

3082.559 --> 3086.2400000000002
does like fractal speak

3086.319 --> 3091.2
it he does like that shamanic like me

3089.76 --> 3092.88
except

3091.2 --> 3096.319
like

3092.88 --> 3097.599
he's been able to like apply

3096.319 --> 3099.119
things

3097.599 --> 3101.52
this knowledge

3099.119 --> 3104.6400000000003
to his life and his actions a lot more

3101.52 --> 3107.119
than i have on average

3104.64 --> 3108.64
so yeah he kind of puts me to shame like

3107.119 --> 3111.839
that

3108.64 --> 3111.839
well yeah what can you do you know

3111.92 --> 3117.2000000000003
not gonna be spiteful over it it's just

3114.559 --> 3117.2000000000003
like yeah

3117.44 --> 3122.16
he's better than you

3119.92 --> 3126.4
well that sucks

3122.16 --> 3128.72
but yeah maybe there's something

3126.4 --> 3129.92
that i could still like

3128.72 --> 3133.52
use to

3129.92 --> 3138.52
lift myself a bit more in that direction

3133.52 --> 3138.52
but yeah he's applied so much

3141.04 --> 3146.5589999999997
like i've mostly just studied things on

3144.24 --> 3149.52
a deeper level i haven't really applied

3146.559 --> 3151.28
myself all that much

3149.52 --> 3156.079
right

3151.28 --> 3158.0
and then yeah to behold a guy like that

3156.079 --> 3160.319
is just like yeah it makes me feel like

3158.0 --> 3163.28
yeah [ __ ]

3160.319 --> 3165.2799999999997
why didn't i actually just do all these

3163.28 --> 3168.2400000000002
things more overtly why didn't i take

3165.28 --> 3168.2400000000002
more risks and

3173.2 --> 3176.64
maybe i just don't have it in me

3178.319 --> 3181.64
i don't know

3220.64 --> 3223.64
huh

3224.48 --> 3230.2400000000002
locks dude well at least gee look

3226.8 --> 3231.8390000000004
there's so many different

3230.24 --> 3234.0
versions of that

3231.839 --> 3237.0
like what direction you want to take it

3234.0 --> 3237.0
at

3246.64 --> 3251.44
i mean if you just simply google that

3249.359 --> 3254.48
word dude you're gonna have like

3251.44 --> 3256.079
thousands of different

3254.48 --> 3259.88
styles and [ __ ]

3256.079 --> 3259.88
thousands and thousands

3264.96 --> 3269.92
right yeah clutch i get that

3267.359 --> 3271.119
with me comes the problem really when i

3269.92 --> 3272.8
feel like

3271.119 --> 3275.04
okay

3272.8 --> 3275.04
so

3275.119 --> 3278.6400000000003
where do i

3276.48 --> 3281.2
actually outshine

3278.64 --> 3284.0
him christopher gardner

3281.2 --> 3284.0
i can't tell

3284.64 --> 3292.319
maybe he has like really weird eccentric

3289.04 --> 3294.079
traits in his direct social interactions

3292.319 --> 3296.079
that

3294.079 --> 3298.2400000000002
i have mastered and he has not and he

3296.079 --> 3300.4
can't because it's like locked in

3298.24 --> 3302.64
i maybe that something like that i don't

3300.4 --> 3304.88
know i don't really know the guy i just

3302.64 --> 3306.72
know he's very intense and so that means

3304.88 --> 3308.1600000000003
he's gonna have a whole bunch of sides

3306.72 --> 3310.8799999999997
to him

3308.16 --> 3313.359
we could never just all show

3310.88 --> 3315.52
online

3313.359 --> 3319.319
and it probably adapts to the people

3315.52 --> 3319.319
that he interacts with

3322.319 --> 3326.4
right so yeah when i'm

3324.4 --> 3328.64
beholding somebody that's like really

3326.4 --> 3330.88
glorious and something

3328.64 --> 3331.839
and i can't find a single thing about

3330.88 --> 3333.599
them

3331.839 --> 3336.48
in which i could like state like oh yeah

3333.599 --> 3339.28
yeah well at least i'm better at that

3336.48 --> 3342.079
that really frustrates me it frustrates

3339.28 --> 3344.0
my ego especially a lot

3342.079 --> 3346.48
i just have to deal with that right and

3344.0 --> 3347.52
trust that well probably over time i

3346.48 --> 3351.52
will

3347.52 --> 3353.7599999999998
balance that out i will find something

3351.52 --> 3355.2
everybody keeps developing and hey if

3353.76 --> 3356.6400000000003
you're super good at something that

3355.2 --> 3359.04
doesn't mean that you don't develop

3356.64 --> 3362.72
blind spots it's like everything has a

3359.04 --> 3366.24
price all power has a price all skill

3362.72 --> 3368.48
everything is just that's how it works

3366.24 --> 3372.7599999999998
you develop one thing other things get

3368.48 --> 3372.76
neglected it's inevitable

3376.319 --> 3381.599
you could philosophically generalize not

3379.52 --> 3383.68
specific to this

3381.599 --> 3386.7200000000003
example with christopher gardner

3383.68 --> 3386.72
you could argue that

3387.2 --> 3390.72
those that always engage and just do

3389.52 --> 3393.599
everything

3390.72 --> 3393.5989999999997
they don't really

3394.88 --> 3398.48
like truly grasp

3399.119 --> 3405.839
how not engaging

3402.16 --> 3405.839
might change things

3406.96 --> 3413.28
well when somebody that doesn't always

3409.599 --> 3416.4
just engage and but always studies it

3413.28 --> 3419.2000000000003
like how they would understand things

3416.4 --> 3422.1600000000003
anyway it's kind of fake

3419.2 --> 3422.16
but yeah

3422.48 --> 3430.6
the guy is impressive

3423.8 --> 3430.6000000000004
[Music]

3431.44 --> 3437.119
yes i know rick back that's what i do

3434.559 --> 3440.3190000000004
master you're it's not a little [ __ ] no

3437.119 --> 3440.319
dude my ego is not

3441.2 --> 3447.1189999999997
there's a lot riding on there

3444.72 --> 3448.9599999999996
it's a challenge like every time my ego

3447.119 --> 3452.559
gets like

3448.96 --> 3454.079
it that means oh that means you're gonna

3452.559 --> 3456.079
get the whip

3454.079 --> 3458.7200000000003
because you gotta become better or at

3456.079 --> 3458.7200000000003
least try

3459.2 --> 3464.0
like if you could never outshine

3461.52 --> 3467.92
somebody in any way

3464.0 --> 3470.64
then at least you can remember that

3467.92 --> 3475.16
that at least you did become better than

3470.64 --> 3475.16
you were when you first faced that

3476.64 --> 3479.839
all right

3477.52 --> 3482.64
it's basically just keep growing no

3479.839 --> 3482.64
matter what you do

3484.86 --> 3490.079
[Music]

3487.68 --> 3491.44
right but yeah i don't like in the past

3490.079 --> 3493.76
if i'd bumped

3491.44 --> 3496.079
into something or somebody that was like

3493.76 --> 3498.48
really

3496.079 --> 3500.079
heavy energy but good and focused and

3498.48 --> 3501.599
did everything right and build

3500.079 --> 3503.04
everything up and everybody respected

3501.599 --> 3505.92
yeah that would

3503.04 --> 3508.799
sometimes like really crush me

3505.92 --> 3511.52
i don't let that happen anymore

3508.799 --> 3515.599
that it literally start attacking myself

3511.52 --> 3516.88
like how dare you not be good enough

3515.599 --> 3518.96
and that's

3516.88 --> 3520.88
that's not good that's never good that's

3518.96 --> 3522.0
when your ego like kind of takes control

3520.88 --> 3524.799
and just

3522.0 --> 3527.04
you don't know what to do about it

3524.799 --> 3527.04
but

3527.76 --> 3531.92
yeah i still

3529.68 --> 3534.72
get ego responses and then it's just

3531.92 --> 3538.16
like i mean like oh [ __ ] the cage is

3534.72 --> 3540.799
starting to rattle that means he's like

3538.16 --> 3543.7599999999998
okay what am i gonna do with this

3540.799 --> 3545.7599999999998
it means he isn't has energy now how can

3543.76 --> 3548.48
i use that energy

3545.76 --> 3550.6400000000003
to basically bend it around

3548.48 --> 3554.0
reroute it

3550.64 --> 3557.2
or at least virtually so

3554.0 --> 3559.68
to eventually cause

3557.2 --> 3562.319
satisfaction so that he stops rattling

3559.68 --> 3562.319
that cage

3562.559 --> 3569.3190000000004
so like internal mechanics this

3566.319 --> 3569.319
hmm

3576.48 --> 3581.64
right so i do look at it as a gift right

3578.64 --> 3581.64
back

3610.96 --> 3613.96
hmm

3634.24 --> 3637.9199999999996
being aware of your own ego is a massive

3636.4 --> 3639.119
gift

3637.92 --> 3643.7200000000003
well

3639.119 --> 3643.7200000000003
it's also extremely punishing

3645.04 --> 3651.68
like especially if it's kind of strong

3648.64 --> 3653.839
i i detected a

3651.68 --> 3655.1189999999997
linear relationship

3653.839 --> 3658.24
with

3655.119 --> 3660.559
like your intelligence versus your ego

3658.24 --> 3662.72
like the smarter the more grip you get

3660.559 --> 3664.3190000000004
over things you're the more burdening

3662.72 --> 3666.72
your ego is going to be

3664.319 --> 3669.2799999999997
because they want to take the credit or

3666.72 --> 3671.839
it wants to take the credit for your

3669.28 --> 3671.8390000000004
ability

3672.079 --> 3676.1600000000003
right it's like oh

3674.24 --> 3678.3999999999996
it's the same type of corruption as

3676.16 --> 3679.839
would happen with the accumulation of

3678.4 --> 3681.6800000000003
wealth

3679.839 --> 3683.7599999999998
somebody just gets so much money that

3681.68 --> 3685.7599999999998
they think like i own all of you and

3683.76 --> 3688.7200000000003
then they lose it right

3685.76 --> 3692.559
well that effect also applies to

3688.72 --> 3692.5589999999997
intelligence in my experience

3694.0 --> 3697.68
and when i say intelligence it's not

3695.76 --> 3700.4
like iq like

3697.68 --> 3702.3999999999996
standard quickness or

3700.4 --> 3705.2000000000003
even creativity

3702.4 --> 3707.839
it's about the ability to oversee how

3705.2 --> 3710.5589999999997
things work

3707.839 --> 3713.44
and the more you get that the more

3710.559 --> 3716.0
your ego will be like oh

3713.44 --> 3719.52
oh so i'm better than everybody else now

3716.0 --> 3719.52
because i understand all that

3720.72 --> 3725.0389999999998
so that happens it does happen that's

3722.64 --> 3726.64
why i always warn

3725.039 --> 3728.1600000000003
people

3726.64 --> 3730.64
not like oh i'm going to tell you a

3728.16 --> 3733.359
really creepy story but no i'm going to

3730.64 --> 3735.92
help you ascend beware

3733.359 --> 3735.92
beware

3736.4 --> 3740.48
it's dangerous because you are going to

3738.72 --> 3742.319
face seductions

3740.48 --> 3744.559
it's going to come

3742.319 --> 3747.2
and if you really smarten up if you

3744.559 --> 3748.7200000000003
suddenly get a grip on a wider level it

3747.2 --> 3751.4399999999996
comes

3748.72 --> 3755.72
it comes right there in your face

3751.44 --> 3755.7200000000003
you're going to have to deal with it

3759.76 --> 3767.4
and the more you climb it the

3763.2 --> 3767.3999999999996
the more it'll be in your face

3770.65 --> 3773.789
[Music]

3781.359 --> 3786.319
so i realized we all share the same

3783.28 --> 3788.559
source of consciousness

3786.319 --> 3788.5589999999997
what

3790.96 --> 3794.2400000000002
that's a

3793.039 --> 3795.44
weird state

3794.24 --> 3796.3999999999996
same source

3795.44 --> 3798.64
what

3796.4 --> 3798.64
no

3801.52 --> 3805.359
consciousness is kind of our own

3808.319 --> 3813.599
i mean we share all information and we

3811.119 --> 3817.2000000000003
share god as our designer

3813.599 --> 3817.2000000000003
and provider of information

3819.92 --> 3826.16
but yeah i always seen

3822.799 --> 3826.16
consciousness is really

3826.319 --> 3830.24
that like that is separate like that is

3828.88 --> 3833.44
the point

3830.24 --> 3834.8799999999997
is that it is separate

3833.44 --> 3837.44
if it's not

3834.88 --> 3839.359
separate then it's not consciousness

3837.44 --> 3842.2400000000002
then it's collective

3839.359 --> 3844.48
autopilot you're not aware

3842.24 --> 3847.4399999999996
you're part of the bigger thing

3844.48 --> 3848.799
of of the standardized system

3847.44 --> 3850.48
of actions

3848.799 --> 3854.4
and everybody follows it right

3850.48 --> 3856.4
consciousness is about separation

3854.4 --> 3859.039
so the state that

3856.4 --> 3861.28
consciousness is all the same source is

3859.039 --> 3861.28
like

3863.28 --> 3869.92
i think that

3866.0 --> 3869.92
the mechanics kind of disagree to that

3877.68 --> 3882.16
if god is aware of every single thing

3879.44 --> 3886.16
then it's the same to him

3882.16 --> 3886.16
how would you know that right back

3886.96 --> 3892.079
are you applying your own consciousness

3889.2 --> 3892.0789999999997
mechanics to

3892.839 --> 3899.64
god can you define the purpose

3896.16 --> 3899.64
of the design

3910.559 --> 3916.6400000000003
so separation is just an illusion from

3913.119 --> 3916.6400000000003
the state of mind

3919.039 --> 3922.039
no

3922.16 --> 3926.5589999999997
separation is a sensation

3924.799 --> 3929.359
it's a social

3926.559 --> 3929.3590000000004
sensation

3931.68 --> 3935.2
it's something your consciousness does

3933.599 --> 3937.44
and then you have

3935.2 --> 3941.4399999999996
responses to that

3937.44 --> 3942.64
if your consciousness sees your itself

3941.44 --> 3946.44
separate

3942.64 --> 3946.44
then there will be separation

3953.119 --> 3956.799
hey julio peppan good to see you

3958.079 --> 3964.039
yeah

3959.839 --> 3964.0389999999998
yep earth is flat indeed

3964.64 --> 3969.2
if you never had a feeling of what yeah

3966.88 --> 3971.52
i know rick yeah but that's that's the

3969.2 --> 3973.2
point it's a feeling

3971.52 --> 3976.2
it's a feeling that's not the

3973.2 --> 3976.2
consciousness

3978.559 --> 3983.52
the consciousness is the attention

3986.48 --> 3989.44
it's the flame

3989.76 --> 3995.5200000000004
it burns the fuel and it cannot be

3993.119 --> 3998.2400000000002
eternal like nobody can be fully

3995.52 --> 4000.24
conscious all the time i mean

3998.24 --> 4002.24
literally

4000.24 --> 4005.0389999999998
you sleep

4002.24 --> 4006.8799999999997
your consciousness doesn't function

4005.039 --> 4008.88
in the same way like there is enough

4006.88 --> 4011.839
there's dream consciousness

4008.88 --> 4011.839
it's very different

4012.64 --> 4016.64
right it's not really

4014.48 --> 4019.2
as time-bound it's more reflecting on

4016.64 --> 4021.1189999999997
just internal experiences

4019.2 --> 4024.319
so

4021.119 --> 4024.319
consciousness is

4024.88 --> 4027.6800000000003
temporary

4027.92 --> 4032.839
right that's why i like to compare it to

4030.24 --> 4035.4399999999996
the element of

4032.839 --> 4037.7599999999998
fire but fire

4035.44 --> 4041.359
yeah it brightens things up but it also

4037.76 --> 4044.079
requires fuel it requires

4041.359 --> 4046.64
things to be

4044.079 --> 4048.6400000000003
conscious about

4046.64 --> 4050.799
and that may run out right eventually if

4048.64 --> 4052.96
the consciousness if you go over the

4050.799 --> 4054.64
same exciting material over and over

4052.96 --> 4056.64
eventually it just doesn't do anything

4054.64 --> 4058.96
anymore why

4056.64 --> 4063.2799999999997
because it's burned out

4058.96 --> 4065.44
the fire that lit up the consciousness

4063.28 --> 4068.1600000000003
like the fuel of it is starting to like

4065.44 --> 4071.44
it's gone and then you just

4068.16 --> 4075.48
sink back to a lower flame

4071.44 --> 4075.48
that's how it works

4095.039 --> 4100.96
but you can leave this form literally

4098.719 --> 4103.96
this form isn't you how how would you

4100.96 --> 4103.96
know

4105.52 --> 4110.64
why are you trying to denounce your

4108.239 --> 4112.799
physical existence

4110.64 --> 4115.6
serious

4112.799 --> 4120.319
when logically the physical existence is

4115.6 --> 4122.159000000001
what provides the very paint the content

4120.319 --> 4124.64
for our framework

4122.159 --> 4126.4
of experiences including in the dream

4124.64 --> 4128.96
world why would you

4126.4 --> 4131.839
suggest denouncing

4128.96 --> 4133.92
the physical experience as not being

4131.839 --> 4136.0
real compared to some other when it's

4133.92 --> 4139.839
obvious that all our experience are all

4136.0 --> 4143.56
reflections of the physical interactions

4139.839 --> 4143.5599999999995
in the physical world

4161.52 --> 4164.88
physicality is the root

4166.64 --> 4173.1990000000005
i didn't say it was the root

4169.759 --> 4176.319
i said it was the paint

4173.199 --> 4179.199
all our dream experiences and even just

4176.319 --> 4182.400000000001
the internal imagery that arrives during

4179.199 --> 4182.4
sensation moments

4182.56 --> 4187.4400000000005
it's all based upon

4185.199 --> 4190.879999999999
things that we experience in the

4187.44 --> 4190.879999999999
physical real world

4191.44 --> 4196.719
it's all reflections of that our very

4193.759 --> 4198.96
mind's internal workings is based off

4196.719 --> 4201.96
reflections of experiences in the real

4198.96 --> 4201.96
world

4202.08 --> 4205.5199999999995
directly and indirectly

4208.8 --> 4212.159000000001
like that's the paint

4212.4 --> 4216.239
that's the paint we use

4214.56 --> 4219.719
to

4216.239 --> 4219.718999999999
have our dreams

4234.19 --> 4243.04
[Music]

4240.4 --> 4245.0
in your mind consciousness creates

4243.04 --> 4248.56
reality well that's a

4245.0 --> 4253.239
unsubstantiated claim i'm sorry

4248.56 --> 4253.2390000000005
to me that's new age science fiction

4258.96 --> 4262.159
you don't have proof of that

4262.56 --> 4264.88
you don't

4265.04 --> 4270.48
literally create reality around you no

4268.4 --> 4272.799999999999
but you can

4270.48 --> 4276.799999999999
use your consciousness

4272.8 --> 4276.8
to utilize what is around you

4277.76 --> 4280.0
right

4283.12 --> 4289.28
we can figure out the design

4286.4 --> 4289.28
of the creator

4291.36 --> 4298.32
but we don't manifest it or rearrange it

4296.719 --> 4300.64
with our consciousness

4298.32 --> 4302.08
like the design itself we just use what

4300.64 --> 4303.679
is there

4302.08 --> 4306.8
we can alter

4303.679 --> 4310.12
what is already there to be or to have

4306.8 --> 4310.12
been different

4315.28 --> 4319.5199999999995
that's like yeah that's like the the

4317.6 --> 4322.4800000000005
same train of thinking as like the

4319.52 --> 4325.280000000001
mandela effect being a literal effect

4322.48 --> 4327.12
like physical physical reality changing

4325.28 --> 4328.88
because of her consciousness

4327.12 --> 4330.719
reset or whatever

4328.88 --> 4333.04
it's the same kind of magical thinking

4330.719 --> 4333.04
really

4337.199 --> 4340.879999999999
right

4338.719 --> 4343.36
but what is most important in the face

4340.88 --> 4344.400000000001
of all that is realizing that

4343.36 --> 4346.48
yeah

4344.4 --> 4348.96
you're going to be living the majority

4346.48 --> 4351.44
of your life in a partially

4348.96 --> 4353.76
self-created

4351.44 --> 4355.919999999999
reality or virtual reality inside of

4353.76 --> 4357.679
your mind in the sense that you're

4355.92 --> 4358.88
dealing with things

4357.679 --> 4360.2390000000005
but your

4358.88 --> 4361.4400000000005
is gonna be

4360.239 --> 4364.0
filled

4361.44 --> 4364.0
up or

4368.56 --> 4371.84
how do you say that

4372.719 --> 4376.2390000000005
you're gonna fill in

4374.56 --> 4378.2390000000005
blank spots

4376.239 --> 4380.718999999999
with your own

4378.239 --> 4383.599999999999
imagination

4380.719 --> 4386.88
and that is the state that you're used

4383.6 --> 4389.679
to as being reality

4386.88 --> 4391.92
it's partially dreams and it always is

4389.679 --> 4393.92
like that there's nobody that isn't in

4391.92 --> 4396.56
that if you're completely out of that

4393.92 --> 4399.84
then people get depressed it's like we

4396.56 --> 4399.84
need the dreams

4404.4 --> 4409.5599999999995
without the dreams we can't really

4406.159 --> 4409.5599999999995
handle reality

4414.32 --> 4418.799999999999
and also we need the dreams to basically

4418.96 --> 4425.56
find purpose and all that

4422.08 --> 4425.5599999999995
and make connections

4426.56 --> 4428.88
anyway

4438.8 --> 4442.8
right so yeah you might believe that

4440.88 --> 4444.0
your consciousness literally makes

4442.8 --> 4447.679
reality

4444.0 --> 4447.679
but that would be a reification

4450.08 --> 4455.84
i can't prove i'm not dreaming right now

4452.88 --> 4455.84
yes i can

4461.52 --> 4468.159000000001
i can't to myself at least i know very

4464.64 --> 4471.4400000000005
well the difference between

4468.159 --> 4474.159
being a waking experience and sleeping

4471.44 --> 4476.32
experience with dreams even daydreaming

4474.159 --> 4479.759999999999
daydreaming has a different type of

4476.32 --> 4479.759999999999
consciousness interval

4480.88 --> 4484.96
it's different this dreamwalk it's

4483.12 --> 4487.44
different but

4484.96 --> 4489.199
it's all still linear and you're still

4487.44 --> 4491.04
gonna face maybe deal with it

4489.199 --> 4492.799999999999
differently you're gonna still face the

4491.04 --> 4497.84
typical or

4492.8 --> 4497.84
linear timeline bound nuisances

4499.12 --> 4503.76
and that's usually to me proof like ah

4501.28 --> 4503.759999999999
this is

4504.64 --> 4509.679
this is this is

4506.719 --> 4512.64
physical reality or like things taken

4509.679 --> 4514.0
from physical like real footage

4512.64 --> 4516.0
looking through somebody eyes or

4514.0 --> 4519.44
whatever based on reality because there

4516.0 --> 4519.44
is nuisance elements

4520.48 --> 4524.799999999999
which when it is pure mind

4523.28 --> 4528.159
you leave that out

4524.8 --> 4528.159000000001
because it's just distracting

4533.6 --> 4537.0
hello agm

4544.48 --> 4549.28
intent and belief have effect on reality

4550.08 --> 4554.4
yeah but why though pj cnet

4552.88 --> 4556.4800000000005
is it because

4554.4 --> 4560.0
your intent and belief do a magical

4556.48 --> 4562.5599999999995
thing or is it because it creates

4560.0 --> 4562.56
energy

4562.64 --> 4568.2390000000005
and that energy is actually the thing

4564.8 --> 4568.2390000000005
that's causing all that

4570.32 --> 4574.48
it's not actually your consciousness

4572.159 --> 4576.5599999999995
it's the energy that does it

4574.48 --> 4578.639999999999
and your consciousness is set to a

4576.56 --> 4579.4400000000005
certain setting

4578.64 --> 4581.360000000001
that

4579.44 --> 4583.12
opens that energy

4581.36 --> 4585.199
that's inspiration

4583.12 --> 4588.719
it's the energy that does it

4585.199 --> 4588.719
not the consciousness itself

4590.0 --> 4593.6
i mean it can be in exactly the same

4592.08 --> 4596.48
consciousness state with the same

4593.6 --> 4599.6
routines the same everything

4596.48 --> 4601.04
well depending on my energy levels

4599.6 --> 4602.320000000001
like if i don't have the end it just

4601.04 --> 4604.159
doesn't work

4602.32 --> 4606.239
it's certainly everything that i do

4604.159 --> 4607.679
exactly the same is embarrassing and

4606.239 --> 4609.04
it's off tone

4607.679 --> 4611.52
yeah

4609.04 --> 4613.92
but when that energy when i when it's

4611.52 --> 4617.120000000001
there then boom suddenly everything

4613.92 --> 4619.6
works and it's like really perfect

4617.12 --> 4621.679
really perfect and everybody feels it

4619.6 --> 4623.92
right it's the energy

4621.679 --> 4627.96
it's not the consciousness it's not what

4623.92 --> 4627.96
it does it's the energy

4639.04 --> 4641.36
right

4640.0 --> 4644.719
but yeah

4641.36 --> 4644.719
the consciousness is

4646.159 --> 4651.44
what

4648.0 --> 4653.92
does conjure forth the energy

4651.44 --> 4654.96
right if you don't

4653.92 --> 4656.4
do it

4654.96 --> 4658.64
if you don't focus with your

4656.4 --> 4662.28
consciousness then the energy is not

4658.64 --> 4662.280000000001
going to start flowing

4664.96 --> 4669.76
i'm just saying

4666.719 --> 4671.52
it's not a direct like oh my

4669.76 --> 4673.12
consciousness is literally

4671.52 --> 4677.120000000001
re-manifesting

4673.12 --> 4677.12
the reality no that's not real

4677.679 --> 4682.159
but you can

4680.0 --> 4684.56
change dynamics of things with your

4682.159 --> 4684.5599999999995
energy

4684.719 --> 4689.36
like people may respond differently

4687.199 --> 4692.799999999999
animals will respond differently and

4689.36 --> 4695.199
here gets when it gets a little weird

4692.8 --> 4697.52
so will objects

4695.199 --> 4697.5199999999995
yeah

4702.32 --> 4705.5199999999995
it's not the consciousness that

4704.32 --> 4706.96
literally

4705.52 --> 4710.719
uses

4706.96 --> 4710.719
the physical realm like clay

4712.32 --> 4715.28
that's not real

4716.32 --> 4721.84
that's a fantasy

4718.0 --> 4724.88
a bit of a megalomaniacal fantasy

4721.84 --> 4724.88
and it's not real

4725.44 --> 4727.678999999999
but

4727.84 --> 4734.2390000000005
with energy

4730.32 --> 4736.08
pretty damn magical things can happen

4734.239 --> 4739.839999999999
and that is all based on like

4736.08 --> 4739.84
inspiration that's where that comes from

4741.199 --> 4747.44
conjure it you lock into it with certain

4743.6 --> 4747.4400000000005
thinking and associations and then you

4747.679 --> 4752.4
and everything changes

4750.08 --> 4754.159
in a sense that things now respond

4752.4 --> 4756.0
differently to you

4754.159 --> 4758.48
that's not your consciousness that done

4756.0 --> 4762.0
that that's the energy that you

4758.48 --> 4764.4
basically summoned

4762.0 --> 4764.4
you see

4764.64 --> 4769.84
it's maybe a bit impromptu on just

4767.28 --> 4772.48
throwing it at you out of nowhere

4769.84 --> 4775.52
but that is a mechanic

4772.48 --> 4777.678999999999
that's how it really works it's palpable

4775.52 --> 4779.040000000001
i'm not the first one to even say

4777.679 --> 4781.76
anything like that

4779.04 --> 4784.64
it's kind of a standardized practical

4781.76 --> 4784.64
thinking fact

4784.719 --> 4790.96
and like that yeah i recognize people

4788.08 --> 4794.6
fractal thinking by them understanding

4790.96 --> 4794.6
this sort of thing

4810.32 --> 4813.84
true prayer and belief will give you

4811.92 --> 4815.36
powers over your own life never thought

4813.84 --> 4819.08
were real yeah but that's the whole

4815.36 --> 4819.08
issue isn't it agent

4819.36 --> 4824.88
our

4821.44 --> 4827.12
natural tendency to size up what is real

4824.88 --> 4831.36
and what isn't

4827.12 --> 4833.04
on average isn't really that accurate

4831.36 --> 4835.04
at all

4833.04 --> 4837.44
yeah so we think oh we could never do

4835.04 --> 4840.32
that yeah well maybe you're just really

4837.44 --> 4842.0
bad in realistically sizing up what can

4840.32 --> 4843.5199999999995
really be possible

4842.0 --> 4845.04
which by the way is nothing to be

4843.52 --> 4847.92
ashamed of

4845.04 --> 4849.76
like i have that a lot

4847.92 --> 4852.2390000000005
it's just like i can't imagine i can't

4849.76 --> 4855.4400000000005
do that but technically

4852.239 --> 4858.32
i know that i could

4855.44 --> 4858.32
it's almost like

4858.96 --> 4861.96
self-discouragement

4875.6 --> 4878.8
not in this world

4879.84 --> 4882.159000000001
what

4884.56 --> 4888.360000000001
what are you talking about

4898.96 --> 4907.4
what the [ __ ] are you talking about

4902.96 --> 4907.4
which g from sc

4921.44 --> 4925.28
sorry to interrupt myself you're not

4923.04 --> 4928.32
interrupting anything agm you're just

4925.28 --> 4928.32
taking part in it

4929.199 --> 4933.919999999999
and hey

4931.199 --> 4936.32
i'm very serious and if i see something

4933.92 --> 4937.04
that's kind of wrong i will just address

4936.32 --> 4940.04
it

4937.04 --> 4940.04
indiscriminately

4944.85 --> 4947.969
[Music]

4967.76 --> 4971.289000000001
[Music]

4978.56 --> 4983.76
right yeah borders boy but even what you

4981.6 --> 4985.679
said will build a relationship with god

4983.76 --> 4988.320000000001
asking for forgiveness with sin and

4985.679 --> 4988.32
repenting

4989.679 --> 4993.6
you don't necessarily even have to be

4991.92 --> 4996.88
fully aware

4993.6 --> 4998.88
of the process it's about

4996.88 --> 5002.159000000001
do those things

4998.88 --> 5004.32
whether you are knowingly interacting

5002.159 --> 5006.239
with god or

5004.32 --> 5009.759999999999
you just go through those process if you

5006.239 --> 5009.759999999999
go through those processes

5010.08 --> 5014.5599999999995
it'll work

5012.48 --> 5017.839999999999
it's like you don't necessarily even

5014.56 --> 5020.96
have to know or believe god

5017.84 --> 5022.719
as long as you just do the actions

5020.96 --> 5026.6
go through that

5022.719 --> 5026.6
the natural response

5032.719 --> 5036.56
i mean

5033.679 --> 5039.28
understanding god and and the designer

5036.56 --> 5041.6
it helps it makes it a lot more easy and

5039.28 --> 5043.28
more like yeah this is absolutely right

5041.6 --> 5045.6
you'll be more

5043.28 --> 5048.32
you'll be less hesitant less seduced

5045.6 --> 5049.76
away from those things if you're aware

5048.32 --> 5050.96
of god but

5049.76 --> 5053.04
in the end

5050.96 --> 5055.12
it's about that you go through those

5053.04 --> 5056.96
cycles

5055.12 --> 5058.639
right

5056.96 --> 5061.52
you make a mistake

5058.639 --> 5063.6
you have to realize that it is a mistake

5061.52 --> 5066.639
by listening to those feelings that i

5063.6 --> 5066.639
think come from god

5066.8 --> 5071.84
like especially if it's really egregious

5068.8 --> 5074.56
and it was really deluded

5071.84 --> 5077.04
and then respond correctly whether you

5074.56 --> 5079.04
in your mind are like oh that is god or

5077.04 --> 5080.88
whether it's just universal like the

5079.04 --> 5083.679
world or

5080.88 --> 5086.56
everybody and not

5083.679 --> 5088.96
not separating yourself like oh no i

5086.56 --> 5091.280000000001
only have to be sorry to this group of

5088.96 --> 5092.74
people and the rest i don't right if you

5091.28 --> 5094.719
do that it's just

5092.74 --> 5097.04
[Music]

5094.719 --> 5099.84
it's that goes wrong

5097.04 --> 5099.84
that's a sin

5100.4 --> 5107.44
so it's about the response those cycles

5104.159 --> 5108.719
wanting forgiveness seeking forgiveness

5107.44 --> 5112.159
and then

5108.719 --> 5115.52
being constructive by repenting you

5112.159 --> 5118.0
don't necessarily have to believe in god

5115.52 --> 5120.080000000001
for that to work it will work

5118.0 --> 5123.12
as long as you just do that whether you

5120.08 --> 5123.12
believe in god or not

5125.76 --> 5132.400000000001
but yeah believing in god does help

5129.84 --> 5134.08
it helps a lot

5132.4 --> 5138.759999999999
makes it easier

5134.08 --> 5138.76
makes it easier for you to focus on that

5139.5 --> 5146.08
[Music]

5142.159 --> 5146.08
okay platitudes agm

5146.48 --> 5149.48
sure

5165.58 --> 5169.97
[Music]

5172.719 --> 5180.08
yeah we're just going so

5175.76 --> 5180.08
i'm sorry do you have to know

5181.679 --> 5186.56
the lord god

5183.84 --> 5189.04
like actually be aware of them to

5186.56 --> 5189.04
love him

5189.44 --> 5193.199
or could you just

5191.52 --> 5195.280000000001
love

5193.199 --> 5197.839999999999
not necessarily

5195.28 --> 5197.84
knowing him

5198.48 --> 5202.759999999999
and then still do it right

5215.84 --> 5220.08
i mean if this is gonna turn out into

5217.76 --> 5222.0
another like you have to do this very

5220.08 --> 5224.239
specific little thing in this very

5222.0 --> 5225.6
specific little way or you're the bad

5224.239 --> 5226.5599999999995
guys

5225.6 --> 5231.08
then

5226.56 --> 5231.080000000001
yeah that's not gonna work out for me

5261.28 --> 5264.28
what

5267.04 --> 5271.04
the [ __ ] are you talking about dude

5272.08 --> 5274.88
i don't believe you

5273.679 --> 5275.92
and

5274.88 --> 5279.639
yeah

5275.92 --> 5279.639
sounds kind of lame

5283.679 --> 5290.36
it's a cow the guy is not in control of

5286.48 --> 5290.36
this keyboard obviously

5320.32 --> 5323.679
oh

5321.199 --> 5326.638999999999
a wrestler

5323.679 --> 5328.32
i'm a wrestler now wee

5326.639 --> 5331.679
okay

5328.32 --> 5331.679
that's really weird

5332.0 --> 5335.199
like who

5333.199 --> 5337.839999999999
and why

5335.199 --> 5337.839999999999
i don't get it

5341.04 --> 5346.88
did they clip like my ray twin clips and

5343.76 --> 5348.96
use that or something

5346.88 --> 5351.1990000000005
i mean i think i could prob with some of

5348.96 --> 5353.36
the voice clips that you could make of

5351.199 --> 5355.5199999999995
my shows you could probably get a pretty

5353.36 --> 5359.04
good villain together

5355.52 --> 5359.040000000001
just by sound bites alone

5363.36 --> 5367.339999999999
mormon irwin that'll be the day

5365.6 --> 5370.08
well maybe rick back

5367.34 --> 5372.96
[Music]

5370.08 --> 5374.719
i have actually been to like the church

5372.96 --> 5377.44
of the letter they saint which is right

5374.719 --> 5377.44
across me

5377.6 --> 5382.639
i visit yeah i visited them

5380.239 --> 5383.919999999999
like weekly every sunday

5382.639 --> 5386.08
for a year

5383.92 --> 5387.92
or more

5386.08 --> 5390.719
i don't really have a lot of relations

5387.92 --> 5394.0
now because they totally cocked to

5390.719 --> 5395.12
corona totally and that was i faced some

5394.0 --> 5398.88
of them like

5395.12 --> 5400.639
you're literally falling in satan's trap

5398.88 --> 5402.88
and they couldn't handle that

5400.639 --> 5404.96
so i was like okay they can't

5402.88 --> 5407.76
i just have to let them

5404.96 --> 5410.0
figure it out you know

5407.76 --> 5412.2390000000005
but yeah there's no point in me going

5410.0 --> 5414.0
back there when i already caught like

5412.239 --> 5415.28
one of the ministers or whatever you

5414.0 --> 5418.0
call them

5415.28 --> 5420.88
having a whole talk about freaking globe

5418.0 --> 5422.56
cosmology [ __ ] i'm like what the

5420.88 --> 5424.2390000000005
hell are you talking about in this

5422.56 --> 5426.639
church

5424.239 --> 5429.12
confronted him with flat earth and so

5426.639 --> 5432.08
they had to strike like that from me

5429.12 --> 5434.08
already and then corona cocking and i

5432.08 --> 5436.0
don't even

5434.08 --> 5437.92
know what it's going to be like if they

5436.0 --> 5440.639
support ukraine or that garbage i

5437.92 --> 5445.3
haven't seen any ukrainian flag or but

5440.639 --> 5448.0
they're cocky and i don't like it

5445.3 --> 5450.56
[Music]

5448.0 --> 5452.48
right but what i do like is that it's

5450.56 --> 5454.400000000001
kind of a community

5452.48 --> 5457.199
and that a lot of the people that do go

5454.4 --> 5459.759999999999
there all seem just like

5457.199 --> 5461.678999999999
good people

5459.76 --> 5463.84
and that's really appealing to me in a

5461.679 --> 5463.84
way

5464.96 --> 5467.36
i mean

5471.6 --> 5473.92
yeah

5472.96 --> 5475.6
there's some

5473.92 --> 5476.88
decently attractive

5475.6 --> 5478.0
young women

5476.88 --> 5479.4400000000005
there as well

5478.0 --> 5481.84
and you know

5479.44 --> 5484.48
that they're not going to be like oh

5481.84 --> 5486.4800000000005
you know why don't we have kids like no

5484.48 --> 5488.239
they're not like that ever and yeah

5486.48 --> 5490.799999999999
that's kind of hard to find these days

5488.239 --> 5491.678999999999
so you know who knows what's going to

5490.8 --> 5493.679
happen

5491.679 --> 5495.92
i don't know

5493.679 --> 5498.1
but i'm overall very sympathetic with

5495.92 --> 5501.04
mormons

5498.1 --> 5504.08
[Music]

5501.04 --> 5506.719
and yeah philosophically it's weird

5504.08 --> 5509.04
there's some weird issues

5506.719 --> 5512.32
but yeah try to find a freaking

5509.04 --> 5515.12
christianity church out there that isn't

5512.32 --> 5516.719
kind of dubious in some way

5515.12 --> 5519.679
you know

5516.719 --> 5522.96
it's really tough to find or just

5519.679 --> 5522.96
impossible i don't know

5524.239 --> 5528.879999999999
but yeah i've had a good vibe of them

5529.199 --> 5531.28
so

5530.239 --> 5534.08
yeah

5531.28 --> 5534.08
i respect them

5534.639 --> 5538.96
but yeah the whole cocking [ __ ] they

5536.639 --> 5542.88
have to stop doing that like

5538.96 --> 5542.88
they gotta get just a little bit

5544.84 --> 5552.88
more a bit more original style

5549.92 --> 5556.56
and just recognize like the the world's

5552.88 --> 5556.56
gonna go insane we shouldn't

5557.6 --> 5561.360000000001
indulge in that

5559.28 --> 5564.4
shouldn't try to stay updated with that

5561.36 --> 5567.04
nonsense it's bad

5564.4 --> 5569.5199999999995
if they'd go for that type of situ

5567.04 --> 5573.96
attitude then i will probably be

5569.52 --> 5573.96
naturally drawn there again

5580.56 --> 5585.400000000001
just not your place brother okay

5598.0 --> 5602.96
i want to talk more freely

5600.719 --> 5604.88
all right well i was able to talk very

5602.96 --> 5606.32
freely it's just you have to do it

5604.88 --> 5607.679
respectfully

5606.32 --> 5611.44
if you do that

5607.679 --> 5614.159
you can literally question everything

5611.44 --> 5617.04
as long as you're like taking it serious

5614.159 --> 5619.28
like this we're trying to figure out

5617.04 --> 5620.639
the truth here

5619.28 --> 5622.719
and not

5620.639 --> 5624.96
start like pushing on other people's

5622.719 --> 5628.0
egos in any sort of way

5624.96 --> 5628.0
like don't do that

5628.4 --> 5634.08
right so like the typical way of going

5631.28 --> 5636.4
about in chat rooms

5634.08 --> 5639.44
or in discord sir yeah that

5636.4 --> 5642.0
keep that the [ __ ] away

5639.44 --> 5642.879999999999
from the mormons okay

5642.0 --> 5645.12
don't

5642.88 --> 5647.04
you should not expect them to start

5645.12 --> 5649.12
communicating with you on that level

5647.04 --> 5651.92
just never never

5649.12 --> 5655.76
think that that that's going to happen

5651.92 --> 5657.36
they don't want to you shouldn't want to

5655.76 --> 5658.96
you're going to have to adapt to the way

5657.36 --> 5660.96
that they talk

5658.96 --> 5662.96
you don't have to overdo it but you have

5660.96 --> 5664.4800000000005
to adapt otherwise it's just not going

5662.96 --> 5666.88
to work the chemistry is just not going

5664.48 --> 5666.879999999999
to work

5667.04 --> 5672.4
but i was able to do that and unleash my

5670.84 --> 5673.28
arwenian

5672.4 --> 5674.5599999999995
gem

5673.28 --> 5677.599999999999
picking

5674.56 --> 5679.52
abilities right as i do and literally

5677.6 --> 5682.320000000001
with everything and they were fully

5679.52 --> 5682.320000000001
accepting it

5682.719 --> 5687.6
fully

5684.32 --> 5690.0
they actually thought i was like

5687.6 --> 5693.4400000000005
they like believed in me in a way even

5690.0 --> 5695.36
eventually they were like yeah that guy

5693.44 --> 5699.799999999999
like

5695.36 --> 5699.799999999999
he does understand god

5703.36 --> 5707.04
they knew that

5704.719 --> 5707.04
anyway

5707.6 --> 5712.76
it's a while ago since i've been there

5709.52 --> 5712.76
last time

5724.96 --> 5731.0
hey

5726.96 --> 5731.0
oh we got a derp alert

5754.239 --> 5758.08
by the people with language turning it

5756.32 --> 5760.96
backwards

5758.08 --> 5763.44
because they're dumb and lazy

5760.96 --> 5765.44
because they don't respect the language

5763.44 --> 5767.919999999999
they just want to get to

5765.44 --> 5770.638999999999
the next thing so they're rushing it

5767.92 --> 5772.639
yeah rushing language makes you sound

5770.639 --> 5775.28
like a complete [ __ ] [ __ ]

5772.639 --> 5778.08
especially if you then clip that

5775.28 --> 5780.96
and play it over and over and over and

5778.08 --> 5785.84
over and over again

5780.96 --> 5785.84
in your advertisement alex jones

5793.28 --> 5798.4
and hey i do make mistakes

5795.6 --> 5800.320000000001
sometimes i like really flop a word or

5798.4 --> 5802.48
or even like evoke a word that's not

5800.32 --> 5804.96
even correct and then i

5802.48 --> 5807.599999999999
don't figure it out right away

5804.96 --> 5810.4
yeah my my english is not perfect but

5807.6 --> 5812.96
i'm at least trying to uphold a certain

5810.4 --> 5814.5599999999995
depth

5812.96 --> 5819.119
of it all

5814.56 --> 5819.119000000001
trying to get real and structural

5824.639 --> 5829.92
but yeah there's a lot of words i can't

5826.88 --> 5831.52
always get them all right

5829.92 --> 5834.719
but yeah there's some people out there

5831.52 --> 5836.4800000000005
that are just sloppy as [ __ ]

5834.719 --> 5837.36
and they're like arrogant about it too

5836.48 --> 5840.08
they're like

5837.36 --> 5842.5599999999995
i can just do it the wrong way who gives

5840.08 --> 5847.08
you [ __ ] and like oh my god you're

5842.56 --> 5847.080000000001
garbage you're just garbage

5860.48 --> 5864.799999999999
right if you're gonna say something in

5862.88 --> 5866.2390000000005
an awkward weird way and you're gonna

5864.8 --> 5868.639
hold on to it

5866.239 --> 5872.4
then you better at least make that funny

5868.639 --> 5872.400000000001
or interesting in some way right

5879.6 --> 5884.56
just gonna be arrogant and lazy that

5881.679 --> 5884.56
just sucks

5885.04 --> 5890.08
and usually only people that are just

5887.6 --> 5891.76
arrogant and lazy tolerate that

5890.08 --> 5894.159
so you're gonna end up with people that

5891.76 --> 5896.719
are arrogant and lazy oh that's a great

5894.159 --> 5899.839999999999
crowd to have oh yes

5896.719 --> 5899.84
so productive

5904.88 --> 5910.119
hey good servant have you unbanned me

5907.119 --> 5910.119
yet

5913.36 --> 5916.36
huh

6230.239 --> 6233.839999999999
now oh [ __ ]

6237.44 --> 6240.638999999999
give it your best shot

6241.679 --> 6245.36
i mean

6242.639 --> 6248.2390000000005
i haven't seen anything from anybody in

6245.36 --> 6248.239
like years

6249.28 --> 6255.44
that even tintilated me in any way

6252.639 --> 6255.4400000000005
to think that

6256.239 --> 6260.36
they're a threat to me seriously

6263.6 --> 6267.4400000000005
she didn't do any yeah well

6266.32 --> 6270.4
you're just

6267.44 --> 6274.36
blind good servant

6270.4 --> 6274.36
you are just blind

6275.199 --> 6281.199
yeah she's a lovely woman i bet she is

6277.36 --> 6286.119
but she was acting like a demon

6281.199 --> 6286.119
and you didn't notice and i did

6334.239 --> 6340.239
okay yeah well hey good servant maybe

6337.92 --> 6341.76
clutch wasn't having a conversation with

6340.239 --> 6343.599999999999
you

6341.76 --> 6345.84
maybe he was having a conversation with

6343.6 --> 6345.84
me

6346.32 --> 6350.96
right i don't see

6347.84 --> 6354.159000000001
why you would be involved in tom and

6350.96 --> 6355.6
steve and here we go again trolling

6354.159 --> 6359.759999999999
because of course you don't do that i

6355.6 --> 6363.1990000000005
don't even know why you would think that

6359.76 --> 6363.1990000000005
we don't think that about you

6364.08 --> 6369.0
so obviously about me so

6373.44 --> 6379.119
you want to do your own show okay fine

6376.639 --> 6379.119
good luck

6380.56 --> 6385.84
just bring things to light that's fine

6383.44 --> 6387.04
i know they're like they're still butt

6385.84 --> 6389.679
hurt

6387.04 --> 6391.84
and they're still waiting when is arwen

6389.679 --> 6393.679
finally going to be like oh finally

6391.84 --> 6397.76
giving up the spirit and gonna be like

6393.679 --> 6399.52
i'm so sorry i mean

6397.76 --> 6402.88
yeah yeah that's

6399.52 --> 6405.1990000000005
never going to happen you see

6402.88 --> 6405.1990000000005
ever

6406.159 --> 6413.5199999999995
i will be reasonable about everything

6409.6 --> 6417.04
but that one little thing that that one

6413.52 --> 6418.159000000001
little thing strongly tied into your ego

6417.04 --> 6423.199
yeah

6418.159 --> 6423.199
never gonna do that you see never ever

6423.92 --> 6428.119
you're gonna have to let it go

6428.48 --> 6432.4
and that's the way i do things

6432.639 --> 6436.4800000000005
everything can be discussed

6434.639 --> 6440.32
but you're gonna have to let it go

6436.48 --> 6444.4
because i'm never going to like yield

6440.32 --> 6444.4
to somebody else's ego nobody's

6449.199 --> 6451.44
like

6454.4 --> 6461.04
remember amanda young

6457.679 --> 6461.04
she had that problem

6461.679 --> 6467.1990000000005
and eventually she kind of like

6464.639 --> 6469.4400000000005
yeah you have to yield and i'm like no i

6467.199 --> 6472.239
don't

6469.44 --> 6472.239
and then she left

6472.639 --> 6480.36
she was following me for like years

6476.239 --> 6480.36
and that's just the way it is

6487.44 --> 6492.239
right from somebody else's show that's

6489.84 --> 6492.2390000000005
different

6493.36 --> 6498.88
but on my show never just never very

6496.88 --> 6501.4400000000005
simple

6498.88 --> 6503.679
that's what you think

6501.44 --> 6506.08
that's what you want then you got a

6503.679 --> 6508.719
problem you better let it go or you or

6506.08 --> 6508.719
you gotta go

6511.04 --> 6514.719
what do i think of good servant show

6515.679 --> 6519.04
well steamy traveler that's a bit harsh

6517.92 --> 6520.4800000000005
to say

6519.04 --> 6522.8
but

6520.48 --> 6522.799999999999
yeah

6522.96 --> 6526.56
or wow as far as i've made it's not that

6525.76 --> 6529.92
bad

6526.56 --> 6532.159000000001
it's just that the

6529.92 --> 6533.36
it's like a speaking room it's just it's

6532.159 --> 6536.799999999999
like guys

6533.36 --> 6539.44
is or people in a it's not a workshop

6536.8 --> 6541.52
like what i do right doesn't to he

6539.44 --> 6543.759999999999
doesn't really have any

6541.52 --> 6546.56
elaborate rules he just has these like

6543.76 --> 6549.6
spiritual christian kind of roles

6546.56 --> 6551.52
but no rules for order really

6549.6 --> 6555.8
he's not good with that at all people

6551.52 --> 6555.8
like get emotionally out of control

6555.84 --> 6559.28
he doesn't really deal with that

6557.679 --> 6561.36
properly

6559.28 --> 6563.92
so

6561.36 --> 6565.04
yeah i'm not super interested in his

6563.92 --> 6567.4400000000005
shows

6565.04 --> 6569.5199999999995
but hey to be fair

6567.44 --> 6572.32
he is basically creating a little

6569.52 --> 6574.080000000001
platform and he has found a crowd now

6572.32 --> 6578.48
what's going to happen with this crowd

6574.08 --> 6578.48
though if he doesn't get stricter

6578.56 --> 6584.88
and more confrontational it's going

6581.04 --> 6588.48
become a chaos room it's gonna be

6584.88 --> 6590.32
whack jobs squirting

6588.48 --> 6592.879999999999
about things that's what you're gonna

6590.32 --> 6595.36
end up with if you don't

6592.88 --> 6596.400000000001
exert discipline

6595.36 --> 6599.04
properly

6596.4 --> 6600.638999999999
so that's what i see about this show but

6599.04 --> 6602.32
i don't think it's better than if it's

6600.639 --> 6604.0
i've heard some pretty cool

6602.32 --> 6606.88
conversations

6604.0 --> 6608.599
it's not like mind-blowing or anything

6606.88 --> 6611.76
especially when it gets like more

6608.599 --> 6613.1990000000005
conspiratorial wide world or satan

6611.76 --> 6614.08
in the world

6613.199 --> 6616.48
yeah

6614.08 --> 6619.04
it's like it's getting bit tropish a bit

6616.48 --> 6620.959999999999
like yeah this doesn't really solve

6619.04 --> 6622.8
anything it's more like aberrational

6620.96 --> 6625.04
thinking and

6622.8 --> 6626.0
i i can't do anything useful with that

6625.04 --> 6627.5199999999995
except

6626.0 --> 6629.84
insert

6627.52 --> 6632.88
insert data file

6629.84 --> 6635.119000000001
bam this is the way it actually works

6632.88 --> 6637.119
to try to instantly reprogram everything

6635.119 --> 6640.0
for anybody that can

6637.119 --> 6642.799999999999
read that that's what i would do is what

6640.0 --> 6644.639
i typically do

6642.8 --> 6646.96
but other than that yeah there's nothing

6644.639 --> 6648.719
really there for me to watch your shows

6646.96 --> 6651.28
there's no point

6648.719 --> 6653.599
i mean i'd rather much rather like sit

6651.28 --> 6655.44
through the chat

6653.599 --> 6658.159000000001
at gympops right

6655.44 --> 6660.239
now that's a place where i can really

6658.159 --> 6663.799999999999
dig in and that's a guy that really

6660.239 --> 6663.799999999999
knows what he's doing

6677.28 --> 6681.159
hey jv what

6684.65 --> 6692.12
[Music]

6692.84 --> 6701.0
dude okay steven traveler you don't like

6695.679 --> 6701.0
it fine don't don't watch it

6718.32 --> 6721.32
hmm

6725.76 --> 6728.4800000000005
time is flown

6733.92 --> 6737.84
conversations all over the place

6744.48 --> 6749.5599999999995
hey linux it's been a while

6753.199 --> 6758.48
got back into the swing of work all

6755.36 --> 6762.839999999999
right well good to hear then linux hope

6758.48 --> 6762.839999999999
the job's working out for you

6765.119 --> 6770.719
all as well yeah almost fine

6768.8 --> 6772.639
could always use some financial support

6770.719 --> 6774.639
though because i don't know how well

6772.639 --> 6778.119
that's going to work out in the next few

6774.639 --> 6778.119
months but

6778.88 --> 6783.28
other than that no i'm enjoying the

6780.8 --> 6783.28
spring

6784.08 --> 6789.04
i went through all

6785.679 --> 6792.639
tribulation crap with my jaw it went

6789.04 --> 6794.159
very serious i kind of lost my

6792.639 --> 6797.4400000000005
i literally

6794.159 --> 6799.199
like failed a fair test and ended up

6797.44 --> 6801.119
yeah getting a bill

6799.199 --> 6805.32
for absolutely nothing in this case it

6801.119 --> 6805.32
was purely my own fault

6806.239 --> 6811.678999999999
i'm going to have to learn how to never

6809.199 --> 6814.0
ever make that mistake again no matter

6811.679 --> 6814.0
what

6816.639 --> 6821.599
it's weird because in previous years

6818.48 --> 6824.5599999999995
i've had that sort of thing and i

6821.599 --> 6827.1990000000005
i did not panic

6824.56 --> 6829.92
many times did not it's like that's part

6827.199 --> 6831.598999999999
of what happens with my body

6829.92 --> 6835.1990000000005
it's the [ __ ] that i have to go through

6831.599 --> 6837.84
but it works already and i trust my body

6835.199 --> 6840.0
and if i do that like the regeneration

6837.84 --> 6841.28
works so well and i like get everything

6840.0 --> 6844.0
back

6841.28 --> 6848.639
it's not like this whole thing keeps

6844.0 --> 6850.159
aging me or anything no no it's not

6848.639 --> 6852.4800000000005
not aging me

6850.159 --> 6852.48
so

6852.88 --> 6858.639
yeah sometimes in pain and

6855.84 --> 6862.679
weird fear it's hard to keep perspective

6858.639 --> 6862.679
on it on it all properly

6878.56 --> 6883.52
look at the screen

6880.48 --> 6886.48
look at the screen yeah that was i keep

6883.52 --> 6888.719
that i hear that echoing in my head a

6886.48 --> 6888.718999999999
lot

6888.88 --> 6895.1990000000005
when he's doing like not like i really

6891.76 --> 6897.76
love it when jim bob does nasa [ __ ]

6895.199 --> 6900.08
which is odd because like oh everybody's

6897.76 --> 6902.2390000000005
done nasa stuff like jaren has done a

6900.08 --> 6906.159
lot of that stuff

6902.239 --> 6908.4
but gymbop makes it so freaking funny

6906.159 --> 6911.44
he's just like totally playing around

6908.4 --> 6914.92
with it and it's so good

6911.44 --> 6914.919999999999
i love it

6919.76 --> 6924.04
yeah and he does a great don pettit

6931.52 --> 6934.579000000001
[Music]

6962.4 --> 6967.839999999999
oh by the way it's weird man

6965.52 --> 6971.280000000001
i've been getting from youtube

6967.84 --> 6974.719
jordan peterson video recommendations

6971.28 --> 6976.5599999999995
i'm like dude what the [ __ ] why the hell

6974.719 --> 6980.199
would you i think i'd ever watch

6976.56 --> 6980.1990000000005
something like that

6993.199 --> 6998.159
i mean at this point is the real jordan

6995.36 --> 6998.159
peterson right

6998.239 --> 7004.718999999999
is there anything worth listening to

7002.56 --> 7006.159000000001
of anything he has to say right now like

7004.719 --> 7009.28
anything

7006.159 --> 7011.36
or is it all like basically outdated 50

7009.28 --> 7014.36
year old techno babble that he's riding

7011.36 --> 7014.36
on

7017.44 --> 7023.28
that's not the right protect

7019.679 --> 7023.28
just platitudes

7024.239 --> 7029.959999999999
it's

7025.04 --> 7029.96
i don't know how to describe it it just

7033.36 --> 7037.159
this garment voice

7041.8 --> 7049.14
[Music]

7050.159 --> 7053.44
what

7051.679 --> 7056.4400000000005

7053.44 --> 7056.44
sanford

7068.56 --> 7074.320000000001
our insects are gone

7070.8 --> 7074.320000000001
what what are you talking about

7078.639 --> 7081.28
are you sure they're not just gonna come

7080.48 --> 7084.28
out

7081.28 --> 7084.28
later

what views jordan peterson do i disagree

7269.599 --> 7273.04
with

everything

7281.52 --> 7284.719
and

7282.56 --> 7289.04
he is he seems like a controlled

opposition vader he is a hostile leftist

7289.04 --> 7293.599
that whether he even realizes it

7291.04 --> 7295.679
consciously or not is basically just

7293.599 --> 7297.84
trying to learn it like oh look see i

7295.679 --> 7301.84
know how it works but

7297.84 --> 7305.76
doing the wrong things anyway

7301.84 --> 7309.360000000001
he's like a fundamentalist hypocrite

he's just lying he's just lying

anti-liberal he's just lying

those eyes like straight you lie

7362.48 --> 7368.4
straight on lie with intentions to lie

vile piece of work

jim bob's funny little voice of him

7384.88 --> 7390.0
is almost too good for him really

7388.0 --> 7392.0
he's a nasty piece of work and he

7390.0 --> 7394.88
doesn't even deserve to have like a

funny caricature of him because he's a

real nasty piece of work

7411.28 --> 7417.119
can you provide me with one of his life

7419.36 --> 7424.88
in what he's doing

7422.32 --> 7427.599
is not the things that he says it's

7424.88 --> 7431.84
why he says it

7427.599 --> 7434.88
what he's supposedly out to achieve

7431.84 --> 7437.28
it's all virtue signaling all of it it's

old virtue signaling

7437.28 --> 7441.28
to the opponent

7440.0 --> 7444.719
like

7441.28 --> 7444.719
he's part of the problem

7444.88 --> 7449.679
and he's constantly blabbering about oh

7447.36 --> 7450.48
it's so problematic he is part of that

7449.679 --> 7452.639
problem

7450.48 --> 7455.5199999999995
he does that [ __ ]

7452.639 --> 7455.52
he's a liar

7456.88 --> 7462.4800000000005

7460.239 --> 7465.839999999999
does

7462.48 --> 7465.839999999999
the whole thing

7470.239 --> 7479.36
like that guy is not anti-liberal

7474.639 --> 7481.119
that's not what anti-liberals do

7479.36 --> 7482.5599999999995
he's a liberal

7481.119 --> 7486.199

[Music]

7538.639 --> 7543.36
i mean guys you realize that

7541.599 --> 7544.96
he goes out gives all these lectures

7543.36 --> 7547.679
supposedly

7544.96 --> 7548.56
people pay huge amount of money for that

7547.679 --> 7550.96
like

7548.56 --> 7553.679
a lot

7550.96 --> 7557.28
and then he had to go

7553.679 --> 7560.96
during the whole covet crisis supposedly

7557.28 --> 7565.5199999999995
allegedly yet the goal to actually

7560.96 --> 7568.2390000000005
demands his and that's his choice his

7565.52 --> 7571.040000000001
choice yeah it's not something he had to

7568.239 --> 7572.799999999999
do he demanded everybody that comes

7571.04 --> 7574.48
watch his lectures pay all that money to

7572.8 --> 7576.719
go and watch him that they all be

7574.48 --> 7579.119
vaccinated okay

7576.719 --> 7579.119
okay

7580.56 --> 7582.96
i mean

7587.679 --> 7592.4
either he's a completely deluded

7590.159 --> 7595.36
megalomaniacal

7592.4 --> 7597.04
crazy person

7595.36 --> 7598.719
that thinks he's all these things but

7597.04 --> 7599.76
he's just not

7598.719 --> 7602.079
or

7599.76 --> 7602.84
he's a monster

7602.079 --> 7604.799999999999
a

7602.84 --> 7608.56
eugenicist

7604.8 --> 7611.28
pl holding up an act like he's actually

7608.56 --> 7615.079000000001
uh against that

7611.28 --> 7615.079
just virtuous secondly

7625.52 --> 7629.119000000001
yeah

7627.44 --> 7630.4
yeah so i've heard psych bear i don't

7629.119 --> 7633.119
really

7630.4 --> 7635.44
care too much but yeah it's this

7633.119 --> 7635.44
dude

7637.36 --> 7640.32
it's a scumbag

7643.679 --> 7649.84
and you know you know it's like

7647.44 --> 7652.0
you could literally put money on that

7649.84 --> 7654.32
you know that if he's gonna be given

7652.0 --> 7656.56
some kind of power root

7654.32 --> 7658.5599999999995
he's either gonna drop out suddenly

7656.56 --> 7661.119000000001
because he loses control or he's

7658.56 --> 7662.96
literally going to just

7661.119 --> 7666.799999999999
make things worse

7662.96 --> 7669.44
or betray like be a judas suddenly

7666.8 --> 7671.52
re-legitimize

7669.44 --> 7674.879999999999
the demonic power structure that was

7671.52 --> 7677.92
faltering right did he do that he

7674.88 --> 7677.92
do that

7678.4 --> 7683.4
because yeah he can he's philosophically

7680.719 --> 7687.199
flexible he can argue whatever he wants

7683.4 --> 7689.04
steamingly for no reason cohesion

7687.199 --> 7691.5199999999995
when it's blatantly obvious he's

7689.04 --> 7692.719
literally playing a political game with

7691.52 --> 7695.280000000001
what he does

7692.719 --> 7695.28
all the time

7698.0 --> 7699.92
i

7698.719 --> 7702.639
just

7699.92 --> 7705.1990000000005
trusting that guy is

7702.639 --> 7705.1990000000005
dangerous

7711.36 --> 7717.04
any travel plans this summer not really

7715.28 --> 7720.079
i might go visit

7717.04 --> 7723.639
my friend in aimera

7720.079 --> 7723.639
that's about it

7792.639 --> 7798.2390000000005
right so yeah anything else

7795.599 --> 7800.32
i'm gonna run at the show otherwise

7798.239 --> 7801.839999999999
could go for a little longer if there's

7800.32 --> 7804.639
some

7801.84 --> 7804.639
energy in here

7805.04 --> 7809.239
check your last comment okay

7814.239 --> 7817.678999999999
a dutch black swan

7817.76 --> 7821.52
no

7818.719 --> 7821.52
no not really

7822.159 --> 7825.159
sorry

7834.4 --> 7839.679
i mean

7835.679 --> 7842.32
yeah just dude i don't really go out

7839.679 --> 7846.0
i don't really do a lot out there it's

7842.32 --> 7846.0
all costing me money and [ __ ]

7854.639 --> 7858.56
i mean if i'd still have my car i might

7856.8 --> 7860.8
be much more inclined to do something

7858.56 --> 7863.280000000001
like that but

7860.8 --> 7864.4800000000005
yeah do it all through public transport

7863.28 --> 7867.88
it's just

7864.48 --> 7867.879999999999
super annoying

7889.84 --> 7895.639
make yourself an e-bike now i have a

7892.159 --> 7895.638999999999
regular bike

7908.159 --> 7913.759999999999
and like e-bikes are

7911.679 --> 7916.8
they get stolen

7913.76 --> 7919.599
pretty easily compared to regular bikes

7916.8 --> 7921.52
as like dutch sailor that guy remember

7919.599 --> 7924.2390000000005
when he hung around here

7921.52 --> 7925.040000000001
he could testify to that multiple times

7924.239 --> 7927.598999999999
so

7925.04 --> 7929.84
no not too eager to get a really

7927.599 --> 7932.639
expensive

7929.84 --> 7935.119000000001
electric bike

7932.639 --> 7935.119
like that

7935.76 --> 7939.679
i mean

7937.28 --> 7941.759999999999
maybe somewhere

7939.679 --> 7944.56
in the not too distant future i could

7941.76 --> 7946.2390000000005
have a car available for me i don't know

7944.56 --> 7948.8
yet it all depends on how it's gonna

7946.239 --> 7950.638999999999
roll out if it's even gonna work

7948.8 --> 7952.96
not because i certainly have money but

7950.639 --> 7955.28
it's through the gti thing you see they

7952.96 --> 7958.159
have a system where you can literally

7955.28 --> 7958.159
hire a car

7959.04 --> 7962.32
for a year or more

7960.96 --> 7966.0
based on

7962.32 --> 7966.0
what you got internally

7966.639 --> 7970.96
in that gti system

7968.88 --> 7973.92
so i might just suddenly have a car

7970.96 --> 7976.32
available for a year i don't know

7973.92 --> 7978.4
it would be a first try out for me i

7976.32 --> 7980.32
think they're still like rearranging

7978.4 --> 7983.839999999999
things

7980.32 --> 7985.599
before it's like even an option again

7983.84 --> 7988.159000000001
but they're working on it they have been

7985.599 --> 7988.159000000001
for a while

7988.719 --> 7993.44
and yeah if i certainly had a car

7991.52 --> 7996.079000000001
then i'd be much more inclined to get

7993.44 --> 8001.32
around and i'll probably will i probably

7996.079 --> 8001.32
will then pick take my p900 with me

8019.84 --> 8025.04
okay lem lenox

8022.8 --> 8027.28
i guess you're really into that

8025.04 --> 8029.119
it's

8027.28 --> 8031.759999999999
i mean i'm not against it or anything

8029.119 --> 8035.239
i'm not against e-bikes it's just that

8031.76 --> 8035.2390000000005
not for me

8043.84 --> 8047.04
at least not

8045.28 --> 8049.04
at this point

8047.04 --> 8051.599
i mean maybe at some point i'm like

8049.04 --> 8053.44
gonna go around on the bike a lot and

8051.599 --> 8055.92
then i'd be like hmm

8053.44 --> 8057.678999999999
i'm putting i'm making so many miles

8055.92 --> 8060.079
with that thing now because of the job

8057.679 --> 8062.88
or whatever then i'd be like yeah maybe

8060.079 --> 8064.079
it's actually worth getting an e-bike

8062.88 --> 8067.84
but

8064.079 --> 8067.84
right now that's just not worth it

8079.199 --> 8084.159
not practical for carrying upstairs yeah

8089.599 --> 8092.0
anyway

8092.32 --> 8096.5599999999995
