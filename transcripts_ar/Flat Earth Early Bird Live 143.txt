good morning welcome to Flat Earth

40.059 --> 48.4
early-bird number 143 I'm your host

44.019 --> 49.829
Arwen and today it's not exactly the

48.4 --> 53.86
same kind of day as yesterday

49.829 --> 57.79
warm it's kind of moist so it's a bit

53.86 --> 61.629
yeah yeah and not so sunny it's kind of

57.79 --> 66.009
cloudy rain here and there but it's

61.629 --> 70.66
still kind of warm though so doesn't

66.009 --> 73.32
have a winter feeling to it at all you

70.66 --> 77.14
can get kind of sweaty in this weather

73.32 --> 81.78899999999999
if you do exercise or anything like that

77.14 --> 89.229
but yeah so how is everybody doing let's

81.789 --> 90.039
see you in chat okay 101 rock hound RV

89.229 --> 93.399
Thompson

90.039 --> 96.909
Juan Carlos and glacier Rosen tinted

93.399 --> 106.18
monocle Steve and Voynich good to see

96.909 --> 108.369
you all and Ober Mukul yeah weird I see

106.18 --> 111.04
you there but the participants list

108.369 --> 114.579
doesn't register it for some reason I

111.04 --> 116.53
don't know why I guess if I want to do

114.579 --> 119.979
it accurately I actually have to look at

116.53 --> 127.649
the chat itself to see everybody who is

119.979 --> 127.649
there see did I skip anyone

128.239 --> 145.7
I had Jessa Conda didn't register weird

137.14 --> 150.58999999999997
anyway yeah so yeah I feel really really

145.7 --> 154.67
good and strong and I think it has a lot

150.59 --> 156.469
to do with the what I thought was krill

154.67 --> 158.75
oil that I got from my stepmother

156.469 --> 161.51
although yeah looked carefully and it

158.75 --> 163.73
seems to be algae based rather so I'm

161.51 --> 167.89999999999998
not exactly sure if that is krill I

163.73 --> 171.379
thought that krill was like mini shrimp

167.9 --> 173.719
something like that maybe maybe I'm

171.379 --> 176.92999999999998
mistaken I don't know but yeah it was

173.719 --> 180.10899999999998
funny on the on the insert it said like

176.93 --> 183.109
yeah take one a day so of course I

180.109 --> 188.9
thought yes screw that and I took like

183.109 --> 195.79000000000002
three yesterday evening just to try that

188.9 --> 201.34900000000002
and yeah I feel excellent so good stuff

195.79 --> 209.87
it's good stuff so yeah what have I been

201.349 --> 214.63899999999998
doing yesterday oh yeah I remember again

209.87 --> 218.959
I basically finished watching the

214.639 --> 222.769
Voyager series and yeah like was

218.959 --> 225.97
foretold to me the end is a kind of

222.769 --> 227.87
disappointing it's like they kind of

225.97 --> 230.569
ended in a rush

227.87 --> 237.62
it feels really rushed it wasn't even as

230.569 --> 242.23899999999998
bad as I thought it was but yeah you it

237.62 --> 244.159
wouldn't be too weird too basic yeah I

242.239 --> 247.04
think they made it with the option that

244.159 --> 251.84
it might continue and then they just

247.04 --> 254.47899999999998
changed the last yeah or like redo the

251.84 --> 256.76
final episode and change it slightly so

254.479 --> 258.289
they can move on to another thing they

256.76 --> 260.45
would be doing but yeah that never

258.289 --> 262.09999999999997
happened too bad

260.45 --> 264.87
I'm gonna really miss

262.1 --> 266.449
miss watching this series it is really

264.87 --> 269.28000000000003
great

266.449 --> 272.31
it's kind of funny though that sometimes

269.28 --> 275.30999999999995
it is kind of like to goody-two-shoes

272.31 --> 277.8
even for me and that weirds me out a

275.31 --> 282.96
little that's like not of this time it's

277.8 --> 292.05
clearly but yeah was a good series and

282.96 --> 294.06
good to see it again yeah yeah a good

292.05 --> 297.03000000000003
question resin tinted monocle house

294.06 --> 301.83
Constance I have seen her around but not

297.03 --> 305.849
here seen her for I think at Martin lit

301.83 --> 309.9
cos and globe busters I I don't know I

305.849 --> 312.449
think probably due to her job it's not

309.9 --> 316.71
so convenient anymore to join at this

312.449 --> 318.81
time the specific time so I think she's

316.71 --> 320.37
just too busy yeah I kind of miss her

318.81 --> 325.349
too would be good to talk to her again

320.37 --> 326.94

325.349 --> 330.96

situation

684.31 --> 688.0999999999999
[Music]

[Applause]

723.66 --> 732.9599999999999
ah goody

729.17 --> 735.81
right so okay probably gonna hear some

732.96 --> 740.0400000000001
[ __ ] back about this bladder debate so

735.81 --> 742.9499999999999
I'll just tell you know even and slick

740.04 --> 747.27
James are complaining in the master be

742.95 --> 750.4200000000001
chat because I sniped slick James I

747.27 --> 752.67
think was yesterday or the day before I

750.42 --> 754.4699999999999
don't know I did it somewhere at some

752.67 --> 758.7299999999999
point because a fight was gonna break

754.47 --> 761.19
out it I know they're censoring me and

758.73 --> 763.53
I've clearly stated that I did it to

761.19 --> 765.12
prevent a fight from breaking out

763.53 --> 768.8399999999999
because some people were getting

765.12 --> 771.0
seriously pissed off and since there

768.84 --> 774.44
were no ballers on I didn't want an in

771.0 --> 778.23
fighting scene to happen so I intervened

774.44 --> 782.0400000000001
yeah and it was meddling but I did it

778.23 --> 784.59
for a good reason and B hangout was good

782.04 --> 788.37
after that so I think then that I did a

784.59 --> 790.86
good job but the another rule they're

788.37 --> 796.52
all complaining about it so I'm not here

790.86 --> 796.52
the end for it for a while oh well

801.49 --> 844.63
ah yeah sorry for being so silent like

839.5 --> 848.83
this it's just very distracting and do

844.63 --> 852.13
need to explain myself very carefully

848.83 --> 859.75
here but I'll try to get back to you

852.13 --> 862.89
guys yeah yeah Joe

859.75 --> 864.459
Jonathon Doherty I snipe for good reason

862.89 --> 868.6899999999999
that's right

864.459 --> 873.8499999999999
not because I didn't like what somebody

868.69 --> 876.2090000000001
had to say because yeah then yeah it's

873.85 --> 881.74
never gonna end

876.209 --> 887.3699999999999
but yeah to prevent infighting okay and

881.74 --> 890.32
a lot of people agreed with me so yeah

887.37 --> 894.029
it is what it is not doing that all the

890.32 --> 894.029
time you know that

897.759 --> 906.16
I don't know she said go him I have I

901.48 --> 908.439
don't remember kicking you so but yeah

906.16 --> 911.499
other people like for example Rand he

908.439 --> 913.889
does have the tendency to kick people

911.499 --> 916.239
just because they piss him off so I

913.889 --> 920.919
didn't want him to get there again

916.239 --> 924.639
because yeah it's not good for the show

920.919 --> 927.279
so I just did it in secret at the time

924.639 --> 929.8290000000001
and the show continued on and it was

927.279 --> 938.829
good so I don't really see the problem

929.829 --> 941.3789999999999
yeah it is what it is but yeah I rarely

938.829 --> 943.2389999999999
kick people I kick trolls and snipers

941.379 --> 945.5690000000001
that's what I usually do at the debate

943.239 --> 945.5690000000001
so

985.6 --> 990.45
[Music]

993.09 --> 996.299
[Music]

1001.47 --> 1008.34
[Music]

1003.68 --> 1009.3299999999999
seaside gajam a joint show as in dual

1008.34 --> 1012.48
live-streaming

1009.33 --> 1012.87
no no not planning to do that absolutely

1012.48 --> 1015.48
not

1012.87 --> 1018.54
well yeah I do go on his show every now

1015.48 --> 1021.3000000000001
and then when I feel like it and he's

1018.54 --> 1024.69
still kind of allowed on this one under

1021.3 --> 1026.339
some pretty strict conditions but he

1024.69 --> 1028.41
knows that and that's fine

1026.339 --> 1033.54
and I still think about him the way I

1028.41 --> 1034.47
think about him and he yeah he's still

1033.54 --> 1037.11
gonna try

1034.47 --> 1040.6200000000001
yeah he's either gonna be just a fellow

1037.11 --> 1043.3799999999999
youtuber or he's gonna be an annoying

1040.62 --> 1046.05
spamming troll so yeah you choose I

1043.38 --> 1050.1200000000001
prefer to just let him do his thing and

1046.05 --> 1055.1699999999998
I don't know I I can't really trust him

1050.12 --> 1058.9399999999998
but I kind of see how he works so I'll

1055.17 --> 1063.15
just use the best option just stay

1058.94 --> 1067.7
friendly with him and not let him yeah

1063.15 --> 1070.97
rolling or control me or anything so

1067.7 --> 1070.97
that's it

1073.16 --> 1078.2

1103.07 --> 1112.1
useless they want to drag it the public

1106.549 --> 1113.45

1440.15 --> 1443.249
[Music]

1446.61 --> 1450.2099999999998
[Music]

1451.11 --> 1465.779
I like that bill G passively

1461.279 --> 1471.36
aggressively neutral or well I pretty

1465.779 --> 1477.769
much chose the words a Bohemia nihilist

1471.36 --> 1481.769
or bohemian soul obsessed but yeah that

1477.769 --> 1506.34
but yeah your description also fits very

1481.769 --> 1513.38
much so I think slick James is shutting

1506.34 --> 1517.62
up for now so let's get back to the show

1513.38 --> 1520.8100000000002

1534.47 --> 1543.8600000000001
business I am to YouTube business and

1539.93 --> 1547.13
yeah I have a couple loyal viewers that

1543.86 --> 1549.02
do donate to me and in that sense yeah

1547.13 --> 1552.92
there is some money to may be made out

1549.02 --> 1560.33
of it but I'm practically financially

1552.92 --> 1563.78
still in a startup stage so I just do

1560.33 --> 1567.4399999999998
the show and like try to gradually build

1563.78 --> 1569.81
up to something but yeah I'm not

1567.44 --> 1572.0
planning to like milk the whole Flat

1569.81 --> 1578.1799999999998
Earth scene for money or something I'd

1572.0 --> 1581.78
rather just find a useful good way to

1578.18 --> 1585.5900000000001
apply money to maybe make a business get

1581.78 --> 1588.59

1666.83 --> 1674.6799999999998
oh he's a grinning the whole situation

1671.96 --> 1677.78
with select James I basically yeah he

1674.68 --> 1680.45
threw it out there he was the one to

1677.78 --> 1683.12
spill the beans because he yeah you

1680.45 --> 1685.46
didn't know I kind of like wanted to

1683.12 --> 1687.3799999999999
keep it a bit hush-hush not I'm not

1685.46 --> 1689.81
bragging about it's not like a proud

1687.38 --> 1693.44
thing I'm so proud that I kicked

1689.81 --> 1696.52
selection no I was just meddling and I

1693.44 --> 1700.46
thought like yeah if I stop this now

1696.52 --> 1703.46
then they'll stop bickering and nobody

1700.46 --> 1705.5
of them has to do it so everybody's kind

1703.46 --> 1708.71
of innocent yeah it is a bit like

1705.5 --> 1710.9
manipulative maybe even wizardry but it

1708.71 --> 1715.06
went all right and was peaceful after

1710.9 --> 1718.7900000000002
that and a good conversation and yeah

1715.06 --> 1721.1299999999999
that's my my argument for it and that is

1718.79 --> 1724.01
all I'm not saying yeah oh yeah I

1721.13 --> 1725.63
recommend you guys do this like all the

1724.01 --> 1728.78
time no absolutely not

1725.63 --> 1731.8100000000002
what saw an opportunity thought I could

1728.78 --> 1735.34
do something good I did it it was a bit

1731.81 --> 1739.22
sneaky but it turned out alright and

1735.34 --> 1742.31
yeah and now slick James is whining on

1739.22 --> 1744.74
about this and oh my god his rights have

1742.31 --> 1750.34
been violated a new I need to contact my

1744.74 --> 1753.59
garden and flatten earth basically

1750.34 --> 1756.26
copy-pasting my personal one-on-one

1753.59 --> 1760.6899999999998
message to him like hey why did you say

1756.26 --> 1760.69
that that was the dickish thing to do I

1761.35 --> 1768.86
guess I didn't really understand what's

1765.53 --> 1774.71
wrong with people going out and just

1768.86 --> 1777.08
trying to observe the earth and with

1774.71 --> 1782.27
different eyes like that's all they're

1777.08 --> 1786.79
really doing and when I when I watch any

1782.27 --> 1789.83
of the shows I don't take something as

1786.79 --> 1791.6
100% you know what I mean even though if

1789.83 --> 1795.53
you see Randy's footage or you see

1791.6 --> 1799.049
Travis's footage Travis he will use the

1795.53 --> 1804.239
word prove some time hmm but

1799.049 --> 1805.889
I don't take that as just throat and

1804.239 --> 1810.929
stone you know what I mean right it's

1805.889 --> 1814.11
the colloquial use of the word proof not

1810.929 --> 1818.0700000000002
the scientific word and that's something

1814.11 --> 1821.639
that the Nathan and John like they

1818.07 --> 1824.539
always take that way they demand that

1821.639 --> 1829.86
but they're still just colloquial talk

1824.539 --> 1833.9089999999999
so I get that I I kind of I kind of

1829.86 --> 1835.9189999999999
respect the way slick yeah I know how he

1833.909 --> 1838.8590000000002
always says it's the way I experience

1835.919 --> 1842.1290000000001
like I can kind of see what he's doing

1838.859 --> 1844.6789999999999
now cuz he's he's setting himself up to

1842.129 --> 1846.4189999999999
where you can't take his argument and

1844.679 --> 1850.169
you can't break it down because he

1846.419 --> 1852.419
doesn't have any right and good is what

1850.169 --> 1856.019
I've noticed he's doing he's he's only

1852.419 --> 1857.789
saying things to where you can't start

1856.019 --> 1860.429
breaking down what he's saying because

1857.789 --> 1865.499
who are we to say what he doesn't

1860.429 --> 1867.929
experience right well he is right but

1865.499 --> 1870.59
there's no point to it it's basically

1867.929 --> 1874.019
just discouraging to think about it just

1870.59 --> 1876.83
experience it don't draw any conclusions

1874.019 --> 1879.21
though don't find any structures or

1876.83 --> 1881.1589999999999
conclusions you may draw of what the

1879.21 --> 1883.47
possibilities that come out of it are

1881.159 --> 1885.23
that it's just discouragement it's

1883.47 --> 1891.119
ridiculous

1885.23 --> 1894.359
it's nihilism I don't like yeah he is a

1891.119 --> 1897.4499999999998
calming factor sometimes when he chooses

1894.359 --> 1900.059
to be so but if he's like personally

1897.45 --> 1902.3690000000001
offended then he gets kind of

1900.059 --> 1903.6589999999999
manipulative and he doesn't he's not

1902.369 --> 1907.879
peaceful at all

1903.659 --> 1912.96
so yeah it's not like he's like a rocket

1907.879 --> 1915.6899999999998
at the beach like the super solid always

1912.96 --> 1917.7
peaceful no not at all he's been

1915.69 --> 1922.3790000000001
actually kind of fight looking for

1917.7 --> 1923.3890000000001
fights even at time so yeah this is what

1922.379 --> 1925.9499999999998
it is

1923.389 --> 1927.9599999999998
yeah I'm not I'm not trying to sit here

1925.95 --> 1931.5
and bash Connor I just

1927.96 --> 1934.26
like that one day where he like he

1931.5 --> 1935.7
brought up the argument like how you

1934.26 --> 1938.34
know how you always say there is no

1935.7 --> 1941.7
distance it's on and like when you say

1938.34 --> 1945.9599999999998
then I know like what you mean like week

1941.7 --> 1948.27
it's not like something that we can show

1945.96 --> 1949.01
that it's physically here you know what

1948.27 --> 1953.91
I mean

1949.01 --> 1957.45
and I guess when he said you know I

1953.91 --> 1962.16
experienced the Sun as it renders to me

1957.45 --> 1965.64
and it's like he was trying to put his

1962.16 --> 1967.23
point on top of yours and that was that

1965.64 --> 1969.6000000000001
kind of bother me and I really like that

1967.23 --> 1972.93
because there is no distance so the Sun

1969.6 --> 1977.4299999999998
I think that sums it up pretty well yeah

1972.93 --> 1979.74
and I don't see why he did why why is

1977.43 --> 1981.8100000000002
that not okay for you you know because

1979.74 --> 1983.16
he wants to talk about his experience

1981.81 --> 1986.49
where he doesn't have to draw any

1983.16 --> 1990.93
conclusions to anything so he's

1986.49 --> 1994.56
basically doesn't like doing this what

1990.93 --> 1997.8600000000001
we do what we're doing very carefully it

1994.56 --> 1999.27
doesn't like that yeah it just seems

1997.86 --> 2002.1499999999999
like he's gotten to the point in his

1999.27 --> 2006.61
mind to where he's never really gonna be

2002.15 --> 2009.38
able to confirm anything for himself

2006.61 --> 2010.79
does that you may see it a different way

2009.38 --> 2014.8400000000001
I don't know I don't really know that

2010.79 --> 2019.6
guy it's just I could just tell when he

2014.84 --> 2022.6399999999999
when he when he when he talks to others

2019.6 --> 2026.62
he only he only sets himself up to where

2022.64 --> 2029.96
you can't take apart what he's saying

2026.62 --> 2032.35
and is strange to me because it's it's

2029.96 --> 2034.76
almost like he knows what he's doing

2032.35 --> 2038.9599999999998
like you're only gonna say something to

2034.76 --> 2043.21
where you know that no one can take your

2038.96 --> 2046.3700000000001
subjective experience and they can

2043.21 --> 2049.52
criticize it or whatever well the

2046.37 --> 2051.98
problem is I think he has a good point

2049.52 --> 2055.28
is always good to basically take a step

2051.98 --> 2058.57
back from your presumptions or your your

2055.28 --> 2060.25
goals what drives you and just

2058.57 --> 2062.26
experience the

2060.25 --> 2067.11
that's actually good thing as part of

2062.26 --> 2069.25
like the earthing yourself yeah it's a

2067.11 --> 2075.36
energetic thing you have to earth

2069.25 --> 2077.56
yourself to not become dislodged

2075.36 --> 2080.4700000000003
spiritually from your own body it's very

2077.56 --> 2083.679
yeah not conscious wise but energy wise

2080.47 --> 2086.56
it's it's a spiritual thing energetics

2083.679 --> 2089.7400000000002
but yeah it's a good thing to do that

2086.56 --> 2092.02
but he then proceeded to say no that's

2089.74 --> 2094.5099999999998
the only thing you need to do don't

2092.02 --> 2098.05
think about it basically and I just

2094.51 --> 2098.71
that's just outrageous to me it's

2098.05 --> 2104.4700000000003
ridiculous

2098.71 --> 2107.56
yeah like why is he on the debates why

2104.47 --> 2111.3399999999997
doesn't he just go to the park sit there

2107.56 --> 2113.02
all afternoon have a nice lunch enjoy

2111.34 --> 2115.3900000000003
the birds enjoy the Sun and just

2113.02 --> 2116.86
experience it and do the night do the

2115.39 --> 2119.14
same thing the next day that's what I

2116.86 --> 2121.51
would be doing if I had his philosophy

2119.14 --> 2123.7599999999998
yeah just experience it

2121.51 --> 2127.1800000000003
why bother people about how they're

2123.76 --> 2137.86
being distracted from the experience and

2127.18 --> 2143.1099999999997
just experience it but when when Travis

2137.86 --> 2146.11
says the word prove I don't agree with

2143.11 --> 2151.1200000000003
it but I know what I know or what Travis

2146.11 --> 2156.1800000000003
means I guess cuz I don't know that was

2151.12 --> 2158.8599999999997
the part that I heard anyway

2156.18 --> 2162.3399999999997
respect to sleep I don't want a bathroom

2158.86 --> 2165.88
I don't know they got so it's like James

2162.34 --> 2171.7200000000003
you mean I mean I've never really talked

2165.88 --> 2171.7200000000003
to him one-on-one so right

2172.93 --> 2179.8999999999996
well I know it's very hard to actually

2176.77 --> 2182.42
have contact with him as you communicate

2179.9 --> 2186.589
with him seems very distant always

2182.42 --> 2191.03
preoccupied with his own his own

2186.589 --> 2193.64
approach approach of thinking so yeah

2191.03 --> 2196.099
it's kind of hard to have a I don't know

2193.64 --> 2198.2
maybe I should just take him separate I

2196.099 --> 2201.079
don't know I don't know the guy - well

2198.2 --> 2206.23
in that sense I seems to be very

2201.079 --> 2212.0890000000004
reclusive in a way mentally and somehow

2206.23 --> 2214.099
but yeah earlier on why I was kind of

2212.089 --> 2218.15
worried about him earlier on is that

2214.099 --> 2220.4300000000003
before he went on the show he I thought

2218.15 --> 2223.4
he was just being very disruptive in

2220.43 --> 2225.319
chat - a trolling level I even deleted

2223.4 --> 2228.829
several of his comments that he made on

2225.319 --> 2231.04
my show a couple of times because I

2228.829 --> 2236.0890000000004
thought you had this guy is just a true

2231.04 --> 2238.43
he's just being a logically disruptive

2236.089 --> 2240.98
about things that make no sense to do

2238.43 --> 2245.66
that so I thought yeah he's a troll and

2240.98 --> 2251.54
then suddenly came on Nathan took him as

2245.66 --> 2253.25
a new wingman and yeah okay he does have

2251.54 --> 2255.02
a way of talking he does have some

2253.25 --> 2259.4
points but then he starts attacking

2255.02 --> 2261.71
people for for yeah thinking about

2259.4 --> 2264.4700000000003
things instead of just experiencing them

2261.71 --> 2267.98
and that just seems purely disruptive to

2264.47 --> 2272.3289999999997
me and I object to that officially it's

2267.98 --> 2275.75
like why yeah and almost it almost seem

2272.329 --> 2279.4300000000003
like it's not it felt like he didn't

2275.75 --> 2283.43
want anyone else to progress right

2279.43 --> 2287.1189999999997
that's kind of a feeling that I got well

2283.43 --> 2289.52
that want is that what he wants it's

2287.119 --> 2293.75
just what comes out of that out of that

2289.52 --> 2296.69
blood here or but it's his philosophy

2293.75 --> 2299.21
that's why I say bohemian so special

2296.69 --> 2301.069
it's so bohemian what he does so it's

2299.21 --> 2303.319
kind of like a bohemian nihilist just

2301.069 --> 2303.92
just experience there's like a Zen

2303.319 --> 2308.599
Buddhist

2303.92 --> 2310.309
but yeah that's not gonna result in a

2308.599 --> 2312.23
lot of creative thinking and

2310.309 --> 2315.4700000000003
conceptualizing you know that's gonna be

2312.23 --> 2318.319
very basic and just experience it and

2315.47 --> 2319.97
that's not what we're doing here with

2318.319 --> 2324.23
flat earth versus the globe and the

2319.97 --> 2325.72
debates especially not so I don't know

2324.23 --> 2329.9
we'll see where it goes

2325.72 --> 2333.8289999999997
yeah I was last night I was thinking

2329.9 --> 2337.25
about I was thinking about this I guess

2333.829 --> 2340.67
this little start that Logan Paul did

2337.25 --> 2342.579
hmm with break you know he claimed a

2340.67 --> 2347.539
flat earth there broke into his house

2342.579 --> 2352.73
what oh you didn't see that Jesus why is

2347.539 --> 2354.7690000000002
that in his movie no sound no so notice

2352.73 --> 2360.26
I still have you ever heard of have you

2354.769 --> 2363.2599999999998
ever heard of Patty may have nope so

2360.26 --> 2367.7000000000003
basically it's a it's a person that

2363.26 --> 2373.279
pretends to be a police officer okay

2367.7 --> 2376.96
and so in the in the image that they

2373.279 --> 2381.4
took or the the little film clip they

2376.96 --> 2387.319
showed a police officer like trying to

2381.4 --> 2389.15
restrain somebody and someone was able

2387.319 --> 2393.7889999999998
to match it up and apparently it looks

2389.15 --> 2397.5190000000002
like patty Mayo but basically logo Paul

2393.789 --> 2405.4100000000003
tweeted that a flat earther broke into

2397.519 --> 2407.24
his house broke a window and other

2405.41 --> 2410.0
people were able to pick it apart and

2407.24 --> 2413.5089999999996
show that it was a hoax and these were

2410.0 --> 2417.349
no landfill on earth right and I was

2413.509 --> 2422.059
just thinking last night and like what a

2417.349 --> 2425.6600000000003
shame like cuz he has to live the rest

2422.059 --> 2428.4500000000003
of his life no one how he lied to

2425.66 --> 2431.18
humanity you know I mean he's a troll

2428.45 --> 2434.1499999999996
you swear not all dignity overboard a

2431.18 --> 2435.569
long time ago so it's just a method to

2434.15 --> 2438.19
him

2435.569 --> 2441.579
right all right but I think it's kind of

2438.19 --> 2443.589
sad that he's poking fun at flatter it's

2441.579 --> 2446.98
still like in the hopes that he'll get

2443.589 --> 2448.869
in some kudos and instead his own fans

2446.98 --> 2451.15
that aren't even flat earthers are just

2448.869 --> 2460.21
picking him apart that's kind of a bad

2451.15 --> 2462.339
sign so yeah I don't know it's just

2460.21 --> 2466.69
really it's just all really strange like

2462.339 --> 2469.119
ever since you know Robbie you know gave

2466.69 --> 2470.92
him the you know rolled out the red

2469.119 --> 2475.569
carpet for him you know gave him the

2470.92 --> 2478.1800000000003
stage time at the conference and ever

2475.569 --> 2482.109
since then I've always wondered like man

2478.18 --> 2485.109
something weird is going on vine like

2482.109 --> 2488.499
mate mate Walt I don't know it's just a

2485.109 --> 2491.499
lot of people are saying that Robbie was

2488.499 --> 2494.6499999999996
deceived you know Robbie Robbie thought

2491.499 --> 2497.14
maybe not something genuine was there he

2494.65 --> 2501.759
took a gamble it's very simple he took a

2497.14 --> 2504.3689999999997
gamble he was advised against it and he

2501.759 --> 2507.039
took a gamble and yeah in that sense

2504.369 --> 2511.029
gambling when you're organizing

2507.039 --> 2513.9100000000003
something that's dangerous so but

2511.029 --> 2517.749
already do you think that this that this

2513.91 --> 2520.6299999999997
topic is something that gamble with well

2517.749 --> 2523.1499999999996
yeah we have serious opponents there are

2520.63 --> 2528.039
serious psychological warfare going on

2523.15 --> 2529.869
so everything you do will have an after

2528.039 --> 2533.38
effect so you have to be very careful

2529.869 --> 2535.599
what you risk because can turn into

2533.38 --> 2541.259
chaos if you're not careful if you take

2535.599 --> 2545.1090000000004
too big chance so yeah I don't know

2541.259 --> 2547.63
maybe he doesn't exactly feel like this

2545.109 --> 2550.749
maybe it doesn't feel it's that bad and

2547.63 --> 2552.88
that made him do it

2550.749 --> 2554.2
like he did it I would have never done

2552.88 --> 2558.029
that and there were a lot of people that

2554.2 --> 2561.009
like what is he doing that's crazy

2558.029 --> 2562.66
because everybody knows Logan Paul you

2561.009 --> 2565.779
just have to do a little bit of

2562.66 --> 2568.0589999999997
background search in what he does it's

2565.779 --> 2570.789
very blatantly obvious yeah

2568.059 --> 2575.1400000000003
you can never trust this guy he's kind

2570.789 --> 2577.9
of open about it even so yeah was just

2575.14 --> 2580.15
silly but he fully admitted it and

2577.9 --> 2582.9390000000003
retrospect the apologies he apologized

2580.15 --> 2585.7290000000003
very elaborately so I think he really

2582.939 --> 2589.449
got it he's probably not gonna make a

2585.729 --> 2594.5389999999998
mistake like that again and if he does

2589.449 --> 2594.539
he's in big trouble let me tell you I

2598.589 --> 2607.3289999999997
just I I expected more from a flower

2602.559 --> 2611.279
there you know from someone who I'm you

2607.329 --> 2615.069
know just like that the film crew that

2611.279 --> 2618.969
did behind the curve I mean it took me

2615.069 --> 2620.619
ten minutes to figure out what films

2618.969 --> 2623.259
they've done in the past mhm

2620.619 --> 2625.199
and once you realize that they did the

2623.259 --> 2627.789
film one I don't want to say it on your

2625.199 --> 2628.059
stream but you know what I'm talking

2627.789 --> 2630.3390000000004
about

2628.059 --> 2632.92
yeah but hold on the behind the curve

2630.339 --> 2635.019
film is a very different setup it was

2632.92 --> 2639.279
much earlier it was much much earlier

2635.019 --> 2641.3799999999997
and there was still the consensus of the

2639.279 --> 2645.219
philosophy any attention is good

2641.38 --> 2647.4390000000003
attention so they knew this was gonna

2645.219 --> 2649.929
happen they didn't know how but they

2647.439 --> 2651.64
knew they were gonna be just put in the

2649.929 --> 2653.739
worst light ever they talked about it

2651.64 --> 2654.969
even before the movie came out yeah

2653.739 --> 2660.789
that's probably gonna happen and it did

2654.969 --> 2663.009
happen so and it still worked so it yeah

2660.789 --> 2666.9390000000003
for that timeframe that concept worked

2663.009 --> 2670.959
out but now is a different period it's

2666.939 --> 2674.89
much more spread out now so the effects

2670.959 --> 2676.9289999999996
will be different I don't think it it

2674.89 --> 2681.8799999999997
still works really any attention is good

2676.929 --> 2685.2690000000002
attention have to be more careful I I

2681.88 --> 2687.7290000000003
just don't understand why you know I'm

2685.269 --> 2689.8799999999997
most pretty much every fighter out there

2687.729 --> 2694.739
that I've ever came across knows that

2689.88 --> 2698.469
the media lies and so I don't understand

2694.739 --> 2701.14
why they want the media I said that's

2698.469 --> 2701.71
int I don't get that well like what why

2701.14 --> 2705.31
do we want

2701.71 --> 2707.5
meaning here with when you say the media

2705.31 --> 2712.42
lies you have to put it into a certain

2707.5 --> 2714.96
context there is a main wide narrative

2712.42 --> 2718.69
and those are obviously lies to anyone

2714.96 --> 2722.14
yeah new delves into even superficial

2718.69 --> 2724.599
conspiracies and they know yeah they

2722.14 --> 2728.5299999999997
lied but that doesn't mean that everyone

2724.599 --> 2730.21
in the media is just hell-bent on that

2728.53 --> 2733.869
and nothing else

2730.21 --> 2735.9700000000003
there's just side projects and yeah

2733.869 --> 2737.77
there's some people that are that will

2735.97 --> 2739.99
do side projects that are pretty

2737.77 --> 2741.849
open-minded and don't yeah they like

2739.99 --> 2743.6189999999997
have to go along with the narrative but

2741.849 --> 2745.51
they don't really care too much about it

2743.619 --> 2749.9500000000003
and they hope that you can just get away

2745.51 --> 2752.98
as a side project but yeah if the main

2749.95 --> 2757.18
hierarchy the main direction of the

2752.98 --> 2758.619
media France is going to intervene yeah

2757.18 --> 2760.93
there isn't really little they can do

2758.619 --> 2762.82
about it it's like if they'd the

2760.93 --> 2766.06
leadership can politically screw a

2762.82 --> 2768.4300000000003
project up they seem it nests that it's

2766.06 --> 2773.83
necessary that's basically what happened

2768.43 --> 2775.5699999999997
probably so yeah it's not like all media

2773.83 --> 2777.73
can never be trusted you have to always

2775.57 --> 2779.9500000000003
put it into a context because not all

2777.73 --> 2786.609
the individuals in such an organization

2779.95 --> 2790.6099999999997
are necessarily evil it's usually the

2786.609 --> 2793.769
leadership the controllers

2790.61 --> 2793.7690000000002
[Music]

2795.779 --> 2808.269
but I I don't know it's just strange man

2801.999 --> 2812.14
sometimes I find myself just trying to

2808.269 --> 2817.1499999999996
not trying not to be like really

2812.14 --> 2819.1589999999997
conspirator about it and I'm just this

2817.15 --> 2823.9
is just strange because a lot of these

2819.159 --> 2825.549
hit pieces and a lot of these well I

2823.9 --> 2828.789
guess you call them hippies mockumentary

2825.549 --> 2832.89
or whatever they're they're all stemming

2828.789 --> 2835.9590000000003
from either a conference or from

2832.89 --> 2842.3799999999997
something that something that Robert

2835.959 --> 2844.359
Davidson is associated with and hmm I

2842.38 --> 2846.159
don't know I just don't get it you know

2844.359 --> 2850.509
and then I don't know if this is true or

2846.159 --> 2853.029
not but but someone else is heavily

2850.509 --> 2855.969
involved indeed beyond the curve whoa

2853.029 --> 2858.159
okay so as well so there's there's some

2855.969 --> 2861.489
there's a couple people saying there

2858.159 --> 2863.7690000000002
that Robert Davison is a film actor but

2861.489 --> 2866.829
I don't have any evidence of that I'm

2863.769 --> 2870.249
not choosing Robbie of a film actor I'm

2866.829 --> 2875.829
just saying it's it's very strange

2870.249 --> 2878.3489999999997
it's very strange and I don't you know I

2875.829 --> 2882.309
know there's good people out there and I

2878.349 --> 2883.869
don't want to bash anybody I just I'm

2882.309 --> 2886.7490000000003
just sitting on the sidelines and I'm

2883.869 --> 2889.929
watching all this go down you know I

2886.749 --> 2893.14
think that doesn't make any sense who's

2889.929 --> 2898.829
actually gonna fall out ackd they're

2893.14 --> 2898.8289999999997
flat earther like that that's just crazy

2904.09 --> 2910.09
and extremely difficult and you're gonna

2908.2 --> 2912.31
have to actually go through the same

2910.09 --> 2918.28
[ __ ] as a flat earther goes through the

2912.31 --> 2920.14
trolls the constant whining and so yeah

2918.28 --> 2922.9900000000002
unless there's like a direct

2920.14 --> 2925.24
conversation or true for some in some

2922.99 --> 2926.74
way that he is basically saying I am an

2925.24 --> 2929.29
actor it's only an act don't worry

2926.74 --> 2933.43
I don't see why these people would even

2929.29 --> 2937.69
consider that he'd be acting all all of

2933.43 --> 2940.99
it that's just absolutely ridiculous too

2937.69 --> 2942.91
much strain for for what for what what

2940.99 --> 2944.79
is he gonna accomplish by acting and

2942.91 --> 2948.73
being a flat earth you're doing all that

2944.79 --> 2952.48
and I could be way off base right now I

2948.73 --> 2955.33
could be just using mine you know I

2952.48 --> 2958.51
don't know I could be totally wrong

2955.33 --> 2960.0099999999998
and that that's why I don't I don't want

2958.51 --> 2962.6200000000003
to sit here and just making any claims

2960.01 --> 2965.8
I'm just all I'm doing is observing and

2962.62 --> 2969.52
I'm noticing that just a lot of these

2965.8 --> 2971.59
stories or they're stemming from that

2969.52 --> 2976.14
group and I don't get it

2971.59 --> 2980.8
I just am in the same class today are

2976.14 --> 2982.87
making an actual media effort maybe just

2980.8 --> 2985.3
like us there because yeah anyone can

2982.87 --> 2987.7599999999998
just come together as a like you at a

2985.3 --> 2989.3500000000004
cafe or whatever you know and bring your

2987.76 --> 2991.7200000000003
mobiles and film it livestream and

2989.35 --> 2996.1
that's nice but there it they're making

2991.72 --> 2997.93
like a never you event of it and there's

2996.1 --> 3000.63
not a lot of other flatterers that do

2997.93 --> 3002.22
that and this group started doing that

3000.63 --> 3005.09
and they all have their media

3002.22 --> 3012.18
connections and their talents and

3005.09 --> 3014.28
they're trying to make it work so yeah

3012.18 --> 3016.89
if you can point at somebody else doing

3014.28 --> 3019.4700000000003
similar things and not getting any

3016.89 --> 3021.8399999999997
attention I'd like to hear about it

3019.47 --> 3024.3599999999997
if you can spot anyone else doing

3021.84 --> 3029.3700000000003
something on this skill concerning flat

3024.36 --> 3031.53
earth and you know what Robert Davis and

3029.37 --> 3035.39
he's done a lot more than I have for fun

3031.53 --> 3035.3900000000003
so I mean it's not like

3035.52 --> 3041.33
it's not like I'm pointing the finger at

3037.74 --> 3044.43
anybody no no no no I'm just asking

3041.33 --> 3046.95
hypothetically I'm not saying like oh

3044.43 --> 3050.19
you can criticize look you can have some

3046.95 --> 3052.23
doubts and you're saying basically that

3050.19 --> 3054.78
you have heard a lot of these rumors and

3052.23 --> 3056.16
you're pondering upon them that's what I

3054.78 --> 3058.53
get from what you said so I'm not

3056.16 --> 3061.41
pointing fingers like are peanuts Clark

3058.53 --> 3063.9300000000003
how dare you no not at all

3061.41 --> 3067.2
I'm entertaining the concept as well

3063.93 --> 3070.77
because I had had some doubts though I

3067.2 --> 3073.29
never thought he was an actor thought

3070.77 --> 3075.27
maybe there was some dubious character

3073.29 --> 3077.67
trait that he may be trying to conceal

3075.27 --> 3080.37
or something like that but I don't know

3077.67 --> 3083.96
with that apology recently

3080.37 --> 3085.2599999999998
it felt really genuine and you you can't

3083.96 --> 3088.35
fake that

3085.26 --> 3090.6600000000003
that's impossible you can't act that so

3088.35 --> 3095.97
I don't know I think it's all right

3090.66 --> 3099.0
I think it's gonna be fine unless

3095.97 --> 3101.91
they're gonna make another blatantly

3099.0 --> 3103.56
idiotic move somehow everybody's gonna

3101.91 --> 3105.24
object you and then they're gonna do it

3103.56 --> 3109.23
anyway if that kind of thing happens

3105.24 --> 3110.9399999999996
yeah that's a different story but yeah

3109.23 --> 3116.73
first something like that has to

3110.94 --> 3118.44
actually happen we'll see it's just it's

3116.73 --> 3121.29
just me sitting on the sidelines and I'm

3118.44 --> 3124.5
just observing alright just saw all this

3121.29 --> 3128.12
stuff like with Logan Paul the

3124.5 --> 3133.28
documentary a couple of other hit pieces

3128.12 --> 3135.66
they all stem from Robbie Davison and

3133.28 --> 3139.26
maybe I am way off base

3135.66 --> 3142.71
maybe I am seeing it totally wrong you

3139.26 --> 3146.4300000000003
know hopefully his intentions are good

3142.71 --> 3148.53
that's that's all I well maybe you

3146.43 --> 3154.02
should get a little better proof than

3148.53 --> 3156.2400000000002
just his presence right around some

3154.02 --> 3158.4
actors or actions conversation some real

3156.24 --> 3160.7999999999997
leads that there's something off instead

3158.4 --> 3163.14
of just why is this guy always present

3160.8 --> 3166.6800000000003
when things go wrong you know right

3163.14 --> 3169.46
that's not a real lead that's just yeah

3166.68 --> 3173.66
that could be very much a coincidence

3169.46 --> 3177.3
so yeah yeah you're right you're right

3173.66 --> 3179.58
well thank you oh yes all right well

3177.3 --> 3181.02
thank you I think I'm gonna run out the

3179.58 --> 3185.94
show now the debates have already

3181.02 --> 3190.41
started and yeah thinking about this you

3185.94 --> 3195.39
know Robbie Davidson under a magnifying

3190.41 --> 3199.44
glass it's good no no I know if you have

3195.39 --> 3202.23
any ideas or questions I think you're

3199.44 --> 3206.37
endowed off no you're free to speak
