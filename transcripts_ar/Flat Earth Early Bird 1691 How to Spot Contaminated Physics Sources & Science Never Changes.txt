6.299 --> 37.64
foreign

7.75 --> 37.64
[Music]

53.48 --> 58.57899999999999

83.759 --> 90.119
really needed

86.52 --> 92.69999999999999
I mean seriously anyway

90.119 --> 95.52
yeah the weather today is quite glorious

92.7 --> 98.88
I got the door closed right now because

95.52 --> 101.759
they decided like right when I was gonna

98.88 --> 103.5
start the show I started mowing the lawn

101.759 --> 105.479
down there and it's making a lot of

103.5 --> 107.47
noise

105.479 --> 111.31
but uh yeah the weather

107.47 --> 111.31
[Music]

111.659 --> 116.28
it's been overall really blue sky

113.939 --> 117.479
there's like these sheep clouds forming

116.28 --> 120.299
over

117.479 --> 122.7
may have been been chemtrail or whatever

120.299 --> 126.96000000000001
in origin I don't know

122.7 --> 130.02
the shapes are a bit suspicious but

126.96 --> 131.94
yeah in between that the sky is really

130.02 --> 135.06
deep blue

131.94 --> 138.06
look at how blue that is

135.06 --> 143.0
and the Sun is pretty warm so I'd say

138.06 --> 143.0
it's probably like 25 degrees right now

143.819 --> 147.81
I needed to give the plants some extra

146.099 --> 150.06
water with this

147.81 --> 152.28
[Music]

150.06 --> 154.5
this heat

152.28 --> 156.48
right but yeah there's also plenty of

154.5 --> 159.84
wind

156.48 --> 163.14
be careful with the doors because

159.84 --> 165.5
they might just Ram themselves shut with

163.14 --> 165.5
this wind

171.12 --> 177.31900000000002
I I really hope they're going to be done

173.22 --> 177.319
soon because it's getting warm in here

178.86 --> 183.68
but I mean yeah the noise is pretty

181.019 --> 183.68
substantial

184.08 --> 191.18
there would be anybody in my chat

187.26 --> 191.17999999999998
I can ask them if they could hear it

198.48 --> 207.89999999999998
right anyhow

201.659 --> 207.89999999999998
it is Wednesday the 16th of August 2023

209.76 --> 212.17999999999998
yeah

212.28 --> 218.36
temperatures 24 degrees right okay

215.7 --> 218.35999999999999
close enough

220.26 --> 224.099
seems like it's going to be this type of

222.239 --> 227.12
weather in the coming week

224.099 --> 227.11999999999998
even hotter

227.4 --> 230.12
we'll see

233.159 --> 238.159
oh Richard G verse in chat it's you

240.2 --> 245.159
can I could you check the sound levels

243.599 --> 247.44
like

245.159 --> 250.85999999999999
can you hear all this

247.44 --> 252.78
motor sounds from the outside

250.86 --> 255.68
right now

252.78 --> 255.68
can you hear any

259.739 --> 262.69899999999996
still going outside

263.22 --> 268.74
that's real the mic doesn't really seem

265.919 --> 274.08
to register much of it hello Stone

268.74 --> 277.08
monkey and then compare that to this

274.08 --> 279.5
where it's definitely registering on the

277.08 --> 279.5
mic

282.08 --> 290.38
[Music]

291.12 --> 295.22
I can't even hear myself thinking

297.18 --> 299.66
right

311.94 --> 317.46
right so yeah yesterday's show I was

314.34 --> 320.28
really satisfied with it

317.46 --> 323.29999999999995
lots of Flat Earth

320.28 --> 323.29999999999995
no anger

323.88 --> 328.5
and it was it was like on itself like

326.58 --> 331.58
the yesterday show was a really

328.5 --> 331.58
spreadable video

331.74 --> 338.82
pretty much for any age

334.5 --> 343.34
so yeah if you ever wanted an episode

338.82 --> 343.34
can't hear from your end what

344.699 --> 349.02000000000004
it's loud outside where you're at oh so

346.8 --> 352.74
they start they are mowing the lawn over

349.02 --> 355.32
at your place as well goody

352.74 --> 358.1
huh

355.32 --> 358.09999999999997
or something

358.8 --> 363.6
right

361.259 --> 367.22
okay we'll just have to

363.6 --> 367.22
do with what we got oh

369.18 --> 375.36
ah seems they might be

371.82 --> 375.36
done awesome

376.62 --> 381.139
so made of weed whacker guys still go

378.9 --> 381.13899999999995
yeah

386.99 --> 390.139
[Music]

395.66 --> 400.259
would an audio interface

400.88 --> 404.24
what do you mean

409.139 --> 415.699
no interface you mean a microphone

412.44 --> 415.699
this isn't what

421.139 --> 426.36
anyway yeah yeah got a Gusto here with

423.78 --> 428.71999999999997
this heat definitely want to take a sip

426.36 --> 428.72
of that

442.02 --> 444.74
whoo

445.139 --> 449.479
yeah he stopped

446.94 --> 449.479
awesome

452.4 --> 459.19899999999996
and that was that was decently fast not

456.96 --> 459.19899999999996
bad

462.9 --> 467.28
right anyhow

465.539 --> 470.599
I'm doing pretty good I got in

467.28 --> 470.599
Illuminati console here

472.44 --> 475.039
and I mean

476.46 --> 481.81899999999996
a bit warm actually for that but I don't

479.759 --> 481.819
know

487.86 --> 492.199
right but yeah my uh

492.479 --> 497.81899999999996
financial situation has not been super

495.12 --> 501.36
forthcoming

497.819 --> 505.44
I mean you guys did help out

501.36 --> 507.539
but yeah I'm kind of stuck now

505.44 --> 509.52
so I'm really hoping for any kind of

507.539 --> 512.3389999999999
donations and then there is a chance

509.52 --> 514.86
that I might get some money in

512.339 --> 517.32
from the government

514.86 --> 519.44
but I mean that's probably gonna happen

517.32 --> 522.899
somewhere in two days but if they

519.44 --> 526.4590000000001
because that has like the 18th was

522.899 --> 526.459
sometimes like a drop point

526.92 --> 532.1999999999999
but other times they just don't seem to

530.1 --> 536.12
give a [ __ ] and you only get that and

532.2 --> 536.12
the 21st like everything else so

537.779 --> 544.1
I really do need some support to get

540.36 --> 544.1
through this last week basically

549.18 --> 552.1999999999999
new interface

555.839 --> 559.74
okay

557.339 --> 563.36
no I don't have that

559.74 --> 563.36
I just have a microphone

569.279 --> 572.779
right anyway yeah

573.06 --> 577.92
please support your local Irwin I really

575.82 --> 580.74
need it

577.92 --> 584.399
it's tough out here everything is really

580.74 --> 587.7
[ __ ] expensive including food

584.399 --> 590.66
which it's not like I am like constantly

587.7 --> 590.6600000000001
engorging myself

591.54 --> 595.04
but even eating

595.08 --> 599.7
like a monk or something like a poor

597.6 --> 602.519
monk or whatever that's not it it could

599.7 --> 604.44
be much worse but still like I am not

602.519 --> 606.9590000000001
eating as much

604.44 --> 609.48
as I used to

606.959 --> 611.64
but even with that it's still tough to

609.48 --> 614.04
get around

611.64 --> 616.56
with how expensive everything has gotten

614.04 --> 618.54
and I noticed that other people that are

616.56 --> 622.16
used to eating more they are really

618.54 --> 622.16
suffering a lot psychologically

622.38 --> 627.3
well a lot there's

624.66 --> 629.16
I can feel the pressure in them

627.3 --> 632.5799999999999
people that are used to eating a lot

629.16 --> 636.18
like they're really feeling it

632.58 --> 639.5400000000001
the the higher prices

636.18 --> 642.68
and I'm noticing also that people

639.54 --> 647.2199999999999
like I went to a regular supermarket

642.68 --> 649.68
to turn in empty bottles right

647.22 --> 652.62
that's really the end and to get trash

649.68 --> 654.779
bags that's right like the only reason I

652.62 --> 656.72
go to that to the main normal

654.779 --> 660.09
Supermarket anymore

656.72 --> 663.44
because they got a good bottle machine

660.09 --> 663.44
[Music]

663.5 --> 668.04
but uh

665.279 --> 670.92
yeah I always pay attention to people

668.04 --> 673.019
that are around there because that's a

670.92 --> 676.14
crowd that I usually don't get to see a

673.019 --> 678.48
lot the regular people

676.14 --> 680.6999999999999
but I always pay attention as to like

678.48 --> 683.779
what are people putting in their in

680.7 --> 683.779
their trolley in their

685.8 --> 691.3199999999999
in their basket on Wheels what do you

687.839 --> 694.019
call that in their cart right

691.32 --> 695.22
and I'm starting to notice that it's

694.019 --> 697.92
just that

695.22 --> 700.9200000000001
people are picking more carefully

697.92 --> 703.38
it just pattern wise like because

700.92 --> 705.4799999999999
there's people that typically they buy

703.38 --> 707.64
huge quantities of things and now I'm

705.48 --> 710.7
just noticing

707.64 --> 714.4399999999999
different patterns is it I am such a

710.7 --> 714.44
geek with this [ __ ] but

715.56 --> 718.76
very niche

726.0 --> 730.98
I'm always catalogic like psychological

728.88 --> 734.54
patterns and like decision making

730.98 --> 734.54
patterns at a distance

735.0 --> 739.44
because everybody makes them everybody

736.68 --> 740.8199999999999
has them all the time like that's what

739.44 --> 742.6800000000001
we run on

740.82 --> 745.2
on patterns

742.68 --> 748.079
and those patterns are often like

745.2 --> 750.1800000000001
directed by intuition

748.079 --> 752.88
or instincts

750.18 --> 755.8389999999999
so it's like a thing that's not really

752.88 --> 755.8389999999999
cognitive or

756.06 --> 760.56
or has a technical oversight that is

758.88 --> 764.66
directing

760.56 --> 767.76
systems that like pattern

764.66 --> 770.1
utilization and frequency change that

767.76 --> 772.019
just happens automatically with people

770.1 --> 773.5790000000001
and they

772.019 --> 776.639
choose

773.579 --> 779.8389999999999
the frequencies and expressions that

776.639 --> 779.839
they feel the most

780.06 --> 784.8
comfortable with basically

782.339 --> 786.9590000000001
or that and they might associate it with

784.8 --> 789.42
their own identities as well so I pay

786.959 --> 791.6389999999999
attention to this [ __ ] all the time

789.42 --> 795.079
I guess because I'm bored

791.639 --> 795.0790000000001
money issues yes

795.72 --> 799.399
I've always had money issues though

804.18 --> 806.8389999999999
right

810.12 --> 817.44
living in the Netherlands is expensive

813.12 --> 818.94
living exclusively all organic in the

817.44 --> 822.1800000000001
Netherlands

818.94 --> 824.339
is really expensive and it's actually

822.18 --> 826.26
crazy that I do it but I know that if

824.339 --> 828.5400000000001
I'd stop doing it I'd completely

826.26 --> 830.8199999999999
physically collapse

828.54 --> 833.16
even just because of the psychosomatics

830.82 --> 836.6600000000001
of it because I've been I basically

833.16 --> 836.66
vowed myself to that

837.54 --> 843.779
and every time I rolled away from it

841.38 --> 846.0
with justification of like I have to

843.779 --> 848.22
test like I have to test like how could

846.0 --> 851.18
I what will happen if I take a bite of

848.22 --> 851.1800000000001
non-organic thing

851.339 --> 857.2790000000001
and every freaking time I would regret

854.16 --> 859.3199999999999
it every time I end up feeling poison

857.279 --> 862.86
and I'm like okay

859.32 --> 867.38
let's just help my kidneys and my liver

862.86 --> 867.38
are going to be able to like get this up

871.56 --> 876.1199999999999
steamy Traveler

873.66 --> 878.579
tarot 306

876.12 --> 881.6
and the Wolf Pack I guess

878.579 --> 881.5999999999999
good to see you all

886.98 --> 891.3000000000001
right but yeah I just wanted to

889.139 --> 894.26
re-emphasize I'm very satisfied about

891.3 --> 894.26
yesterday's show

895.339 --> 901.44
I really do believe that that person

898.8 --> 905.42
that came in the chat was a new person

901.44 --> 909.1800000000001
everything that I felt from it

905.42 --> 912.019
and even how they interacted with you

909.18 --> 912.019
suspicious lot

912.3 --> 916.8599999999999
proved to me like absolutely certainly

915.12 --> 920.279
like that's

916.86 --> 922.62
really a newbie

920.279 --> 927.199
they were very careful because it's like

922.62 --> 927.199
oh this is like triggerable grounds

927.24 --> 933.139
but that's valuable because they didn't

929.82 --> 933.139
just immediately run away

933.3 --> 937.8599999999999
and I had to like get loud with slo-mo

936.24 --> 939.62
moon buggy because he just was really

937.86 --> 943.76
getting

939.62 --> 943.76
full detective mode again

944.76 --> 949.9399999999999
no profanities facts get REM yes

950.04 --> 955.3389999999999
so yesterday's show is definitely a

952.44 --> 955.339
kid-friendly show

955.44 --> 958.44
and it was

956.94 --> 960.7790000000001
focused

958.44 --> 965.94
and also

960.779 --> 969.6
pretty difficult because I I try to use

965.94 --> 972.12
simple forms to explain

969.6 --> 975.6
technically complicated things

972.12 --> 977.579
and things that definitely kids and all

975.6 --> 979.62
that will probably have never really

977.579 --> 982.62
heard of before except

979.62 --> 985.92
online people bickering about that and

982.62 --> 987.839
with that and not being super cohesive

985.92 --> 990.4799999999999
or explanatory

987.839 --> 993.72
right and rampa Singh so that's all

990.48 --> 998.519
difficult then this shows specifically

993.72 --> 1001.94
was a real good opportunity to give some

998.519 --> 1004.699
prefab building blocks to be able to

1001.94 --> 1007.2790000000001
deal with it with these things

1004.699 --> 1009.079
and with the bickering potentially that

1007.279 --> 1011.24
you might come across if you choose to

1009.079 --> 1013.88
like openly talk about these type of

1011.24 --> 1016.4590000000001
things on social media

1013.88 --> 1018.98
right so it's a full package it's a

1016.459 --> 1022.7589999999999
really good like introductory

1018.98 --> 1025.64
Advanced introductory in that sense

1022.759 --> 1027.6200000000001
and I'm very satisfied about it and I'm

1025.64 --> 1030.5200000000002
really surprised that I didn't get more

1027.62 --> 1030.52
views immediately

1032.36 --> 1036.339
but that doesn't really matter

1042.5 --> 1045.439
because it's at

1043.78 --> 1049.24
181.

1045.439 --> 1049.24
that is extremely low

1050.179 --> 1056.74
for my shows which usually get to a 200

1053.84 --> 1056.74
very quickly

1064.16 --> 1070.48
and I completed another month enough

1066.38 --> 1070.48
does that mean you just fat

1071.24 --> 1074.26
that sounds weird

1074.539 --> 1078.82
when you formulate it like that turret

1079.7 --> 1084.5
but uh yeah congratulations

1082.88 --> 1085.7
look Johnny

1084.5 --> 1088.24
[Music]

1085.7 --> 1088.24
show

1093.26 --> 1099.22
and in their subscription list

1096.44 --> 1099.22
hmm

1103.16 --> 1108.44
okay yeah Johnny I didn't know that I

1105.98 --> 1110.84
didn't pick up on that

1108.44 --> 1114.02
but

1110.84 --> 1116.299
this is yeah the jam Panda especially is

1114.02 --> 1119.6
Right rhetoric is like

1116.299 --> 1121.94
yeah and Normie could like in their

1119.6 --> 1125.299
investigation like

1121.94 --> 1127.3400000000001
it still can be not like the person look

1125.299 --> 1129.08
if somebody's like I gotta figure out

1127.34 --> 1130.6999999999998
this damn Flat Earth that's giving me a

1129.08 --> 1132.559
headache the people bickering about I

1130.7 --> 1135.26
don't know where I stand

1132.559 --> 1137.08
I'm gonna YouTube it or Google it yeah

1135.26 --> 1140.559
well guess what's gonna happen

1137.08 --> 1143.12
anti-flat Earth are disgusting scumbags

1140.559 --> 1144.86
right in front of your face right

1143.12 --> 1146.2399999999998
immediately that's the first thing

1144.86 --> 1148.539
you're gonna see

1146.24 --> 1152.419
all these asses

1148.539 --> 1154.52
and well as a newbie you're gonna click

1152.419 --> 1156.88
some of it and you're probably gonna

1154.52 --> 1161.24
click the people that look the least

1156.88 --> 1164.2990000000002
repulsive this is really that does and

1161.24 --> 1166.28
hey Rex rhetoric is not like an ugly guy

1164.299 --> 1169.299
so that makes sense

1166.28 --> 1172.3999999999999
with gem Panda however

1169.299 --> 1177.52
it's quite the opposite but Jim pen is

1172.4 --> 1177.52
not exactly like on camera all the time

1177.98 --> 1182.3600000000001
right so

1180.38 --> 1184.16
from what I got there that information

1182.36 --> 1186.5
investigative information good

1184.16 --> 1187.64
information very helpful I would

1186.5 --> 1190.039
conclude

1187.64 --> 1192.14
that could be natural that could be the

1190.039 --> 1195.08
people they kind of bump into

1192.14 --> 1197.1200000000001
and they like keep a hook on it because

1195.08 --> 1199.299
they're still investigating the whole

1197.12 --> 1199.299
thing

1199.52 --> 1204.74
I'm a little surprised then however

1202.34 --> 1206.6599999999999
that they would bump into me because of

1204.74 --> 1207.919
a random recommendation that's a bit

1206.66 --> 1211.76
weird

1207.919 --> 1214.7800000000002
like that's a weird algorithmic decision

1211.76 --> 1214.78
if that is real

1215.24 --> 1222.14
right but it could also have been in

1218.48 --> 1224.48
an anti-flat Earth infiltrant again that

1222.14 --> 1227.539
really really seriously played it off

1224.48 --> 1229.52
like a newbie and did a great job well

1227.539 --> 1230.9
in that case

1229.52 --> 1233.66
thanks

1230.9 --> 1235.8200000000002
because to me technically it doesn't

1233.66 --> 1238.88
really matter

1235.82 --> 1241.1
whether you're secretly an infiltrant

1238.88 --> 1243.0200000000002
like I'm not gonna give you a wrench if

1241.1 --> 1245.6599999999999
you're used to do cover okay that's

1243.02 --> 1246.62
never gonna happen so it doesn't work

1245.66 --> 1249.38
like that

1246.62 --> 1251.26
so there's nothing I have to lose and

1249.38 --> 1255.2
I'm given an opportunity of somebody

1251.26 --> 1258.02
that is as good as a newbie which I can

1255.2 --> 1261.26
then use and keep using he didn't like

1258.02 --> 1264.9189999999999
oh it wasn't a newbie afro he just kept

1261.26 --> 1267.799
go inact so I'm like well now I have a

1264.919 --> 1269.1200000000001
show that I did because there was a

1267.799 --> 1271.52
newbie

1269.12 --> 1273.799
whether that nobody was really a newbie

1271.52 --> 1276.3799999999999
or an anti-flat earth or infiltrate

1273.799 --> 1278.78
pretending to be a newbie really

1276.38 --> 1280.0590000000002
upholding the act really well it doesn't

1278.78 --> 1282.799
matter

1280.059 --> 1284.98
because I had a really great show out of

1282.799 --> 1284.98
it

1287.539 --> 1291.679
they were paying for blood yes

1289.52 --> 1293.9
and I know they were and I I didn't

1291.679 --> 1297.0800000000002
think they were your old fools it's just

1293.9 --> 1299.6000000000001
that hey I'm actually rolling out a

1297.08 --> 1303.9399999999998
really focused show now

1299.6 --> 1303.9399999999998
that takes priority over

1304.22 --> 1308.8600000000001
who oh who is that new person

1309.799 --> 1312.34
right

1313.159 --> 1316.94
sleep the whole day national holiday

1315.08 --> 1319.76
here oh all right Tara yeah no problem

1316.94 --> 1321.8600000000001
it was I was mostly talking Flat Earth

1319.76 --> 1324.76
the Flat Earth arguments and explaining

1321.86 --> 1328.1
them to a newbie explaining them

1324.76 --> 1330.08
simplistically but as you know

1328.1 --> 1332.9599999999998
really complicated grounds like

1330.08 --> 1335.299
including terrestrial refraction

1332.96 --> 1337.82
I I went as far as to explain the

1335.299 --> 1339.74
Armenian Paradox now that is really

1337.82 --> 1342.86
advanced

1339.74 --> 1345.6200000000001
but I was able to basically do start out

1342.86 --> 1348.08
with oh geometric claim of a globe right

1345.62 --> 1350.78
Horizon should be Earth curve and

1348.08 --> 1352.8799999999999
obstructing things then oh

1350.78 --> 1355.8799999999999
it isn't that Black Swan what is the

1352.88 --> 1358.159
Black Swan well Carl popper analogy the

1355.88 --> 1359.9
whole that whole thing completely rolled

1358.159 --> 1362.659
out the whole story

1359.9 --> 1365.299
but kept as short as I could

1362.659 --> 1367.88
and and keeping it entertainment right

1365.299 --> 1370.22
and then moved on to like oh yeah so

1367.88 --> 1373.5200000000002
then they say refraction potentially if

1370.22 --> 1375.559
they're like used to anti-flat earthers

1373.52 --> 1376.52
some people say refraction even though

1375.559 --> 1379.039
they don't know what they're talking

1376.52 --> 1382.34
about when they say that

1379.039 --> 1384.919
it's just their way of trying to De

1382.34 --> 1388.48
reconcile with the Black Swan argument

1384.919 --> 1391.94
which there is no you can't

1388.48 --> 1393.74
but they do it through the refraction

1391.94 --> 1396.679
and explain what that is that it's

1393.74 --> 1398.059
mathematical that it suggests bending of

1396.679 --> 1400.2800000000002
light in a way that's completely

1398.059 --> 1402.559
unnatural compared to actual refraction

1400.28 --> 1405.86
because actual refraction turns out to

1402.559 --> 1408.44
be insignificant deviation and it's

1405.86 --> 1411.799
mostly results in weird blurring effects

1408.44 --> 1414.44
at very far distances

1411.799 --> 1417.76
and then only at the end

1414.44 --> 1420.8600000000001
so any angular deviation is going to be

1417.76 --> 1423.4
literally insignificant

1420.86 --> 1423.3999999999999
right

1424.58 --> 1429.9189999999999
Etc so I explained the whole works how

1427.22 --> 1432.159
yeah that Earth curve went on from Earth

1429.919 --> 1434.419
curve to like the Earth not moving

1432.159 --> 1436.2800000000002
coriolis deviation I might have missed

1434.419 --> 1438.5590000000002
up a couple of names there I'm because

1436.28 --> 1441.1589999999999
guys there's a lot of names that are

1438.559 --> 1441.1589999999999
involved

1441.2 --> 1446.179
like historical names I'm not the best

1444.5 --> 1449.78
name guy

1446.179 --> 1451.3400000000001
so I might have said like this person oh

1449.78 --> 1453.799
wait no that person

1451.34 --> 1455.78
and then they have absolutely nothing to

1453.799 --> 1458.0
do with what I did Ben explained after

1455.78 --> 1460.539
that I'm sorry I'm really sorry I mess

1458.0 --> 1460.539
up the names

1461.0 --> 1465.5
like and in those moments it's like it

1463.76 --> 1467.48
would be really great if there was

1465.5 --> 1470.059
actually a

1467.48 --> 1471.799
a flat Earth panel

1470.059 --> 1473.4189999999999
Flat Earth debates panel that would

1471.799 --> 1477.3799999999999
surround me because they'll guide those

1473.419 --> 1481.9
guys know these names really well

1477.38 --> 1481.9
my memory for it is not great

1483.38 --> 1490.0390000000002
yeah and of course ended the the three

1487.76 --> 1491.48
arguments set with gas pressure without

1490.039 --> 1493.64
a container

1491.48 --> 1495.2
and then also addressing a bit like what

1493.64 --> 1497.539
is the container and what do people

1495.2 --> 1499.3400000000001
think that it is the Dome

1497.539 --> 1501.74
and then just like that it doesn't

1499.34 --> 1503.6
really matter because the only thing

1501.74 --> 1507.02
that matters is that there is gas

1503.6 --> 1510.9189999999999
pressure so whatever the containment is

1507.02 --> 1514.4189999999999
it has to be a limiting factor for the

1510.919 --> 1514.419
gas pressure to expand into

1514.52 --> 1518.72
something that would physically stop it

1517.22 --> 1521.48
somehow

1518.72 --> 1523.7
right and I didn't really go off into

1521.48 --> 1525.74
looping and all that because it's not

1523.7 --> 1529.3400000000001
directly relevant

1525.74 --> 1532.1200000000001
it's just my own Curiosities about the

1529.34 --> 1532.12
nature of the realm

1532.34 --> 1535.6399999999999
so yeah that that was that show

1534.44 --> 1537.919
yesterday

1535.64 --> 1541.0
I'm very satisfied about it I haven't

1537.919 --> 1541.0
watched it back though

1542.96 --> 1545.6200000000001
what is this

1547.279 --> 1551.98
since here on this channel

1549.38 --> 1551.98
yeah

1554.12 --> 1558.5
perfect shirt got past

1556.82 --> 1561.74
photographer

1558.5 --> 1564.559
to determine the authenticity which he

1561.74 --> 1566.9
could confirm oh yeah sure yeah was

1564.559 --> 1568.279
there fisheye lens involved

1566.9 --> 1570.2
[ __ ]

1568.279 --> 1572.36
because there always is

1570.2 --> 1574.76
which was also part of what I was

1572.36 --> 1578.62
mentioning yesterday

1574.76 --> 1578.62
without any swearing necessary

1583.039 --> 1590.32
uh right

1586.539 --> 1590.32
hey como virus

1593.9 --> 1596.5
ah

1603.38 --> 1608.2
Buddhist monks are walking by again

1609.64 --> 1615.8600000000001
so it looks really weird one of them has

1613.279 --> 1618.4
a hat on that

1615.86 --> 1618.3999999999999
that's just we

1618.799 --> 1622.24
gray long dress

1622.94 --> 1631.419
with a white

1625.82 --> 1631.4189999999999
like a lady hat very weird

1633.559 --> 1635.799
foreign

1645.64 --> 1649.779
than yesterday I suspect

1672.679 --> 1676.8200000000002
right I hope I helped slow my own buggy

1675.14 --> 1678.0800000000002
didn't get pissed off he did take the

1676.82 --> 1681.2
hint

1678.08 --> 1684.02
but I mean I do consider him as like one

1681.2 --> 1688.5800000000002
of my more valuable wrenches

1684.02 --> 1692.24
and like I just needed him to like stop

1688.58 --> 1694.9399999999998
disrupting the moment that was all I

1692.24 --> 1698.679
really hope he comes back

1694.94 --> 1698.679
yes some great input too

1709.039 --> 1711.64
foreign

1723.88 --> 1728.659
to your photo No Tara that there is no

1727.279 --> 1731.0
such thing

1728.659 --> 1734.6200000000001
and by the way he doesn't have a wrench

1731.0 --> 1734.62
so he can't really link it up

1734.72 --> 1738.98
I mean he could potentially send me an

1737.0 --> 1741.64
email but

1738.98 --> 1741.64
okay

1748.299 --> 1752.72
alrighty then technical data

1751.4 --> 1755.72
off the

1752.72 --> 1758.3600000000001
camera sure

1755.72 --> 1762.14
can do that

1758.36 --> 1763.82
right but I mean to me it is completely

1762.14 --> 1766.3400000000001
pointless

1763.82 --> 1767.779
like I'm not falling for it like I'm not

1766.34 --> 1769.4599999999998
actually gonna entertain you you're

1767.779 --> 1773.679
gonna have to like make your own little

1769.46 --> 1773.679
video showing off your own [ __ ]

1774.2 --> 1778.7
and then brag about it or something and

1776.6 --> 1782.0
hey we might respond

1778.7 --> 1784.1000000000001
we might we we might if it's really good

1782.0 --> 1785.779
and Technical we might even review you

1784.1 --> 1787.399
on fed and tell you how you're

1785.779 --> 1789.64
presupposing everything and how you're

1787.399 --> 1789.6399999999999
wrong

1790.76 --> 1797.799
but just saying you have a photograph it

1794.539 --> 1797.799
just doesn't cut it

1800.779 --> 1806.179
right

1802.58 --> 1807.62
and it technically it technically

1806.179 --> 1810.0800000000002
doesn't even matter

1807.62 --> 1812.799
there is no outer space it violates

1810.08 --> 1812.799
natural law

1813.38 --> 1819.7990000000002
there's no spot and it violates relative

1816.5 --> 1822.679
density too right just think about that

1819.799 --> 1825.22
there is no place you can hover up like

1822.679 --> 1829.039
you can hover up there it violates

1825.22 --> 1832.039
relative density yeah things don't hover

1829.039 --> 1834.14
when surrounded by really thin air and

1832.039 --> 1837.08
they're like solid and liquid things or

1834.14 --> 1839.419
whatever yeah they don't hover

1837.08 --> 1842.9189999999999
because they're more dense than their

1839.419 --> 1842.919
surrounding they're gonna go down

1847.12 --> 1852.3799999999999
space violating natural lies always fun

1849.74 --> 1854.539
I know it's really funny it's very funny

1852.38 --> 1858.2
to you Akuma virus

1854.539 --> 1862.1
I know the the biggest lies are always

1858.2 --> 1864.46
the hardest to defeat in people's minds

1862.1 --> 1867.98
like the ones that are like colossal

1864.46 --> 1870.5
those ones don't go away so easily

1867.98 --> 1873.02
yeah little lies are

1870.5 --> 1876.799
kind of easily unraveled

1873.02 --> 1879.3799999999999
but the really really big ones those are

1876.799 --> 1882.22
like people will uphold them

1879.38 --> 1882.22
to the death

1882.86 --> 1889.059
that's a well-known fact about human

1886.1 --> 1892.1589999999999
Mass psychology

1889.059 --> 1894.799
so I know it's very funny

1892.159 --> 1898.0390000000002
that space violates natural law I know

1894.799 --> 1900.26
you think that's very funny but it is

1898.039 --> 1903.94
it is absolutely true and there's

1900.26 --> 1903.94
nothing anybody could do about it

1908.799 --> 1914.6589999999999
yeah and like how does a freaking void

1913.34 --> 1917.059
expand

1914.659 --> 1919.5200000000002
somebody explained to me how void

1917.059 --> 1921.86
expands like that whole part is ironic

1919.52 --> 1923.899
by itself like

1921.86 --> 1927.4399999999998
the whole point of avoid is is that it

1923.899 --> 1932.12
pulls things in it void tends to shrink

1927.44 --> 1935.8400000000001
how the hell does a void expand this is

1932.12 --> 1938.32
just it's so bizarre who the hell came

1935.84 --> 1938.32
up with that

1939.5 --> 1945.32
like

1942.08 --> 1948.1399999999999
by the descriptions of what they say the

1945.32 --> 1949.8799999999999
universe is ever expanding void of

1948.14 --> 1953.6000000000001
vacuum

1949.88 --> 1956.0
so that means there's like a

1953.6 --> 1957.98
like the only way I could conceive of

1956.0 --> 1959.84
anything remotely like that and it's

1957.98 --> 1961.94
even what I'm going to describe is

1959.84 --> 1966.98
technically physically impossible would

1961.94 --> 1971.0
be a vacuum chamber that expands

1966.98 --> 1973.039
that's like so strong that it's like the

1971.0 --> 1974.26
yeah you could compare it to like a

1973.039 --> 1976.82
steel

1974.26 --> 1977.98
tube with two

1976.82 --> 1980.299
suction

1977.98 --> 1982.46
hydraulic suction that literally like

1980.299 --> 1985.82
pull a vacuum but I mean

1982.46 --> 1990.5
a vacuum is so incredibly powerful

1985.82 --> 1994.279
that literally cranes use vacuum suction

1990.5 --> 1996.38
to lift like perfectly like enormous

1994.279 --> 1998.32
things

1996.38 --> 2002.2
so

1998.32 --> 2004.48
how freaking strong

2002.2 --> 2007.3600000000001
is it is it technically even possible

2004.48 --> 2009.88
like how um like colossally strong would

2007.36 --> 2015.34
two arms have to be to be able to pull a

2009.88 --> 2017.44
vacuum like literally a a volume of void

2015.34 --> 2021.82
within a containment like

2017.44 --> 2024.059
that's unbelievably difficult so how the

2021.82 --> 2024.059
hell

2024.22 --> 2028.72
vacuum of space

2027.039 --> 2032.5
expand

2028.72 --> 2034.299
like the void expense

2032.5 --> 2037.779
like

2034.299 --> 2041.5
when thinking in how physics works that

2037.779 --> 2044.74
idea is so diametrically opposed to like

2041.5 --> 2049.14
natural natural workings it's bizarre

2044.74 --> 2049.14
it's bizarre to consider that

2052.119 --> 2056.7400000000002
yeah

2053.26 --> 2060.28
the void of outer space is expanding

2056.74 --> 2061.72
it's becoming bigger more volume for the

2060.28 --> 2063.94
void

2061.72 --> 2067.1789999999996
like when

2063.94 --> 2071.08
void is one of the most powerful tools

2067.179 --> 2074.98
even in Industry to lift gigantic things

2071.08 --> 2077.859
like that's how tough it is for a void

2074.98 --> 2080.56
to become bigger in in volume

2077.859 --> 2083.44
that's how tough that is

2080.56 --> 2086.859
it's so crazy

2083.44 --> 2091.7200000000003
please Define natural workings

2086.859 --> 2094.54
natural workings as in natural law

2091.72 --> 2097.06
second law of thermodynamics

2094.54 --> 2099.7
gas pressure and vacuum workings

2097.06 --> 2103.18
aerodynamics

2099.7 --> 2105.8799999999997
vacuum mechanics physics

2103.18 --> 2108.66
natural workings yeah that's that's a

2105.88 --> 2108.6600000000003
real short

2126.52 --> 2131.14
the void is there matter expense yeah

2129.4 --> 2132.82
because

2131.14 --> 2136.2999999999997
void

2132.82 --> 2137.8
always has a tendency to contract to be

2136.3 --> 2142.1400000000003
filled up yeah

2137.8 --> 2146.6800000000003
nature of horse a vacuum

2142.14 --> 2150.7599999999998
nature is extremely intolerant towards a

2146.68 --> 2154.359
vacuum it does not allow

2150.76 --> 2156.28
a volume to be void

2154.359 --> 2159.22
it doesn't allow it

2156.28 --> 2163.599
it's like almost you could say the

2159.22 --> 2167.02
number one law of the forces of nature

2163.599 --> 2170.6800000000003
like all how everything works and pushes

2167.02 --> 2172.78
and does things and keep it it things

2170.68 --> 2174.22
together right all the forces in the

2172.78 --> 2178.32
universe

2174.22 --> 2182.2799999999997
it's like the number one law no volume

2178.32 --> 2188.1400000000003
shall be without matter

2182.28 --> 2191.44
it's like the god of physical mechanics

2188.14 --> 2195.48
dictate it's just like there shall be no

2191.44 --> 2195.48
volume void of matter it's like

2196.06 --> 2203.74
when that law is violated then like

2199.18 --> 2206.0789999999997
things get really forced like just

2203.74 --> 2208.0
create a vacuum in a vacuum chamber that

2206.079 --> 2210.76
vacuum chamber is gonna be on some

2208.0 --> 2213.04
serious forces

2210.76 --> 2215.5
right all the gas on the outside

2213.04 --> 2219.4
pressing on it

2215.5 --> 2222.88
trying to fill that that void that

2219.4 --> 2224.859
violates the number one rule like there

2222.88 --> 2226.92
shall be no volume without matter and

2224.859 --> 2230.56
it's like everything's like

2226.92 --> 2233.579
they're trying to get in there

2230.56 --> 2233.5789999999997
that's it tough

2238.0 --> 2243.04
I'm anthropomorphizing matter a bit in

2240.94 --> 2248.28
this but this is like a spirit of matter

2243.04 --> 2248.2799999999997
which is ironic but I mean it is true

2254.2 --> 2259.5
yeah Ace your sources suck

2259.66 --> 2267.66
yeah there is no thermodynamic set of

2264.4 --> 2272.04
laws that have the word

2267.66 --> 2272.04
Universe in them okay

2272.44 --> 2279.04
because

2273.72 --> 2281.339
universe is a pseudoscience science body

2279.04 --> 2285.4
of science

2281.339 --> 2290.92
astrophysics phrase it has absolutely

2285.4 --> 2295.0
nothing to do with actual physics

2290.92 --> 2298.32
so you just copy that from a pseudo sign

2295.0 --> 2298.32
Source Ace

2298.9 --> 2304.6600000000003
I don't even know need to know what the

2300.94 --> 2308.52
source is I can see it by the words that

2304.66 --> 2308.52
are Incorporated within it

2308.56 --> 2312.66
hey Bill Nye The Science and I are good

2310.3 --> 2312.6600000000003
to see you

2314.32 --> 2318.6400000000003
later

2315.53 --> 2320.6400000000003
[Music]

2318.64 --> 2325.7999999999997
you sir

2320.64 --> 2325.7999999999997
you sir you don't understand

2327.48 --> 2330.78
you sir

2352.24 --> 2356.859
that's how a Glover [ __ ] sounds in real

2354.4 --> 2358.2400000000002
life yeah yeah Owen Benjamin does them

2356.859 --> 2360.339
well too

2358.24 --> 2364.24
it's overall gamma's it's not just

2360.339 --> 2367.0789999999997
locucks although most Gammas tend to be

2364.24 --> 2367.0789999999997
glow Cox

2368.44 --> 2372.48
like the real bottom of the

2372.94 --> 2377.14
bottom of the barrel

2375.7 --> 2380.2
gammas

2377.14 --> 2381.8199999999997
are all glow [ __ ] the because they are

2380.2 --> 2384.2999999999997
usually defined by cutting to everything

2381.82 --> 2387.339
and being passively aggressively

2384.3 --> 2390.6600000000003
delusional in opposition to that that's

2387.339 --> 2390.66
like the ultra gamma

2392.22 --> 2396.3999999999996
[Music]

2393.88 --> 2399.54
but you can still be very gamma and not

2396.4 --> 2399.54
be a glow [ __ ] though

2404.619 --> 2413.26
no no no no no no no your source

2409.0 --> 2415.96
is horseshit Ace SW has nothing to do

2413.26 --> 2418.8590000000004
with millions of people your source is

2415.96 --> 2423.64
not tapped from millions of people

2418.859 --> 2426.2799999999997
besides physics has nothing to do

2423.64 --> 2427.54
with democracy

2426.28 --> 2430.599
yeah

2427.54 --> 2434.2799999999997
if millions of people thought

2430.599 --> 2437.44
think and agree to exactly verbatim that

2434.28 --> 2438.579
horseshit that you just posted in my

2437.44 --> 2442.2400000000002
chat

2438.579 --> 2444.3390000000004
that's not an issue you see physics only

2442.24 --> 2447.2799999999997
deals

2444.339 --> 2450.04
with proven

2447.28 --> 2453.099
experiments

2450.04 --> 2454.839
and natural laws as they have been

2453.099 --> 2457.599
established

2454.839 --> 2462.339
based on physical reality and it doesn't

2457.599 --> 2464.8590000000004
involve astrophysics cosmology nonsense

2462.339 --> 2468.22
and by that lingo

2464.859 --> 2472.5
you know it is part of that and thus

2468.22 --> 2472.5
null and void horseshit

2473.2 --> 2479.859
your sources suck by the lingo they

2476.92 --> 2481.839
utilize you know this is not pure it's

2479.859 --> 2483.8199999999997
like tapping in a well it's like uh

2481.839 --> 2486.88
there's

2483.82 --> 2490.0
I smell it yeah there's [ __ ] in there

2486.88 --> 2492.04
somebody dropped turds in there or a

2490.0 --> 2495.52
bird died in there you can smell it it's

2492.04 --> 2498.88
like yeah I don't need to use this water

2495.52 --> 2503.079
it's polluted see there's the dead bird

2498.88 --> 2505.6800000000003
floating in there I can still see it

2503.079 --> 2505.6800000000003
yeah

2505.96 --> 2511.619
the lingo is incorrect your sources suck

2512.02 --> 2514.32
foreign

2517.26 --> 2521.8
you can like give all your questions you

2520.24 --> 2526.68
like

2521.8 --> 2526.6800000000003
but you shall know them by their lingo

2541.54 --> 2547.599
yeah that guy doesn't know a lot he's a

2544.359 --> 2549.64
he's a gamma [ __ ] with turret I wouldn't

2547.599 --> 2553.7400000000002
take anything you saying serious this is

2549.64 --> 2553.74
like one of those Discord trolls

2554.68 --> 2560.0989999999997
yeah

2557.079 --> 2560.099
it never ends

2561.72 --> 2567.359
she is just here to gamma spaz I'm just

2565.06 --> 2567.359
just

2569.859 --> 2576.24
turd stained just leave him let him spot

2573.94 --> 2576.2400000000002
her

2585.62 --> 2590.64
[Music]

2588.04 --> 2590.64
foreign

2597.839 --> 2604.14
no no no no that's not true conspiracy

2600.88 --> 2607.92
nuts entropy and thermodynamics is not

2604.14 --> 2607.92
specifically about heat

2610.3 --> 2616.7200000000003
yeah eat

2612.76 --> 2619.8390000000004
is part of entropy

2616.72 --> 2624.1189999999997
gas pressure expanding

2619.839 --> 2624.119
is also part of entropy

2626.74 --> 2633.52
it's that whole spectrum of automatic

2630.819 --> 2635.38
movement from one part of the spectrum

2633.52 --> 2638.14
to the other

2635.38 --> 2639.46
hot to cold high pressure to low

2638.14 --> 2642.819
pressure

2639.46 --> 2645.04
you see it's not the gas or the

2642.819 --> 2647.14
temperature itself that is the entropy

2645.04 --> 2650.44
it is the motion

2647.14 --> 2653.0789999999997
of those factors towards the other side

2650.44 --> 2658.02
of the spectrum

2653.079 --> 2658.02
that is the entropy it's the motion

2659.859 --> 2663.94
the transition

2661.78 --> 2665.98
within that Spectrum

2663.94 --> 2668.2000000000003
that always happens in One Direction

2665.98 --> 2670.06
high pressure to low pressure hot to

2668.2 --> 2674.339
cold

2670.06 --> 2674.339
that is entropy

2683.7 --> 2689.02
right

2685.859 --> 2692.56
or another form of that same entropy

2689.02 --> 2695.14
Spectrum application would be

2692.56 --> 2698.22
Electric

2695.14 --> 2700.18
is it negative positive

2698.22 --> 2703.1189999999997
polarization

2700.18 --> 2705.7
yeah there's always going to be a spark

2703.119 --> 2708.88
from the negative to the positive

2705.7 --> 2710.56
if the tension is high enough versus the

2708.88 --> 2713.5
proximity

2710.56 --> 2715.599
between the two poles there will always

2713.5 --> 2718.42
it will always happen

2715.599 --> 2720.7000000000003
why does it always happen because

2718.42 --> 2724.66
tension

2720.7 --> 2728.14
right one pole to the other

2724.66 --> 2730.7999999999997
if they get rich they will always

2728.14 --> 2730.7999999999997
Bang

2731.56 --> 2736.72
connect neutralize discharge now the

2734.8 --> 2738.94
discharge the electrical effect itself

2736.72 --> 2742.72
is not entropy

2738.94 --> 2746.319
but how it transpires

2742.72 --> 2748.54
from negative to positive

2746.319 --> 2752.5
there is always going to be that

2748.54 --> 2755.2
tendency to discharge if it can

2752.5 --> 2757.359
and that tendency

2755.2 --> 2759.7
is the entropy

2757.359 --> 2764.859
because it's a spectrum again from one

2759.7 --> 2767.98
side to the other it will always want to

2764.859 --> 2771.819
do that bang if it can

2767.98 --> 2775.119
right just like gas pressure always will

2771.819 --> 2777.339
want to expand towards the lower

2775.119 --> 2779.56
pressure Zone if it can if it's

2777.339 --> 2782.619
something in the way but still wants to

2779.56 --> 2785.44
get there but it stopped right and the

2782.619 --> 2788.079
same goes for electricity discharging

2785.44 --> 2789.64
well sometimes it just can't make the

2788.079 --> 2791.8590000000004
connection the tension's not high enough

2789.64 --> 2795.22
the distance too big it's not enough

2791.859 --> 2797.5
conductivity in between so it will want

2795.22 --> 2799.359
to but if something is preventing it

2797.5 --> 2802.78
from happening and when the conditions

2799.359 --> 2804.7599999999998
would be there like oh the barrier of

2802.78 --> 2806.92
the vacuum chamber suddenly disappears

2804.76 --> 2809.4
or hey the material between the two

2806.92 --> 2812.079
discharge between the two poles

2809.4 --> 2815.079
certainly becomes connectable well guess

2812.079 --> 2818.6800000000003
what the gas boom goes into that volume

2815.079 --> 2821.6800000000003
and it neutralizes right equalizes

2818.68 --> 2824.56
and a oh it connects in between bang and

2821.68 --> 2827.0989999999997
certainly the discharge happens and

2824.56 --> 2830.2
yeah it's neutralized it's discharged

2827.099 --> 2832.6800000000003
that that it always wants to do that

2830.2 --> 2836.4399999999996
from one side of the other to the other

2832.68 --> 2839.94
within a spectrum of such an effect that

2836.44 --> 2839.94
is the entropy

2840.16 --> 2845.5
yeah

2841.18 --> 2848.2799999999997
entropy always applies to spectrums

2845.5 --> 2848.28
like that

2858.44 --> 2865.3
[Music]

2861.88 --> 2869.1400000000003
so yeah there you go that's entropy

2865.3 --> 2874.1800000000003
whatever your sources are they suck

2869.14 --> 2877.319
yeah there's no word Universe in entropy

2874.18 --> 2877.319
it's not involved

2877.66 --> 2884.68
so everything that entropy entails is

2881.74 --> 2886.72
naturally provable

2884.68 --> 2890.5
or rather

2886.72 --> 2892.5989999999997
you can't disprove it like or you could

2890.5 --> 2894.4
theoretically disprove it but everything

2892.599 --> 2896.319
you're going to do is gonna prove it

2894.4 --> 2897.94
right and that's how it was established

2896.319 --> 2902.099
to be natural law

2897.94 --> 2902.099
that was later unified in entropy

2903.46 --> 2908.26
it's something that you could test

2905.38 --> 2911.079
whether it happens or doesn't happen but

2908.26 --> 2914.46
it always happens

2911.079 --> 2917.8590000000004
and yeah and you you don't need anything

2914.46 --> 2920.26
you don't need to do anything for it to

2917.859 --> 2923.2599999999998
always happen it just always happens and

2920.26 --> 2926.5
that's why it's an actual law

2923.26 --> 2929.5200000000004
right and it's all testable right with

2926.5 --> 2929.52
right in front again

2929.619 --> 2933.819
that's the difference so universes and

2932.68 --> 2937.24
all that

2933.819 --> 2940.54
and things like gravitations and orbits

2937.24 --> 2942.3999999999996
none of that has anything to do with

2940.54 --> 2945.24
natural law

2942.4 --> 2945.2400000000002
those are all

2945.66 --> 2953.64
astrophysics based science fiction words

2950.38 --> 2956.7400000000002
and if they are used

2953.64 --> 2960.46
within some somebody's description of

2956.74 --> 2963.24
entropy then their source is polluted

2960.46 --> 2963.2400000000002
it's poison

2966.76 --> 2968.76
Ed

2969.4 --> 2974.04
okay

2971.02 --> 2974.04
and it's back

2980.56 --> 2986.7
right so anyway that's

2983.74 --> 2986.7
that's how you know it

2988.119 --> 2992.44
I hope you followed all that or that

2990.4 --> 2994.2400000000002
anybody of you is actually listening and

2992.44 --> 2998.28
not just preoccupying yourself with

2994.24 --> 2998.2799999999997
bickering with other people in the chat

2998.619 --> 3001.46

3038.0 --> 3041.11
[Music]

3077.76 --> 3080.5400000000004
see

3114.5 --> 3119.599
I'm working on the title it's going to

3116.94 --> 3119.599
be complicated

3142.44 --> 3145.4
yay

3145.8 --> 3151.559
yeah this this is gonna be it I think

3149.28 --> 3154.3190000000004
how to spot contaminated physics

3151.559 --> 3156.02
information sources

3154.319 --> 3158.7599999999998
yeah

3156.02 --> 3161.66
is anybody still here in the chat did

3158.76 --> 3161.6600000000003
you all just leave

3174.44 --> 3180.599
and

3176.18 --> 3183.1189999999997
so b as a term usage for total heat

3180.599 --> 3185.78
content of a particular

3183.119 --> 3185.78
okay

3190.52 --> 3194.119
disorderliness of the system

3194.28 --> 3199.619
yeah don't know about that steamy

3196.44 --> 3201.839
traveler seems to be very liberal with

3199.619 --> 3204.359
the the approach of it I mean people

3201.839 --> 3207.0589999999997
maneuver their understanding of this

3204.359 --> 3210.24
around all the time as in

3207.059 --> 3212.52
just like with oh this is science yeah

3210.24 --> 3214.859
all that [ __ ] has just been like throw

3212.52 --> 3216.599
it's like being pearls being thrown in

3214.859 --> 3218.16
front of swines and the swines are like

3216.599 --> 3220.98
yeah I'm gonna

3218.16 --> 3222.8999999999996
make my version interpretation of it

3220.98 --> 3225.42
that's happened

3222.9 --> 3227.7000000000003
it's a gigantic mess

3225.42 --> 3230.339
that's why our there are all these

3227.7 --> 3231.54
popular ideas of what the scientific

3230.339 --> 3234.72
method is they had to go around

3231.54 --> 3238.22
everywhere that are totally totally

3234.72 --> 3238.22
provably horseshit

3240.54 --> 3248.16
this is also a big mission

3243.059 --> 3252.9
within fed to fight against that

3248.16 --> 3254.64
the watering down the The Liberation of

3252.9 --> 3258.059
science

3254.64 --> 3261.359
from it just being a rigid and very

3258.059 --> 3263.579
usable and repeatable method that always

3261.359 --> 3265.88
stands the test of time like nothing

3263.579 --> 3269.1600000000003
that has ever been scientifically proven

3265.88 --> 3271.98
has changed even though people like to

3269.16 --> 3275.0989999999997
blabber their mouths off about like how

3271.98 --> 3276.78
it does change and it's complete or [ __ ]

3275.099 --> 3279.44
I mean those people are [ __ ]

3276.78 --> 3279.44
delusional

3279.5 --> 3286.28
how things work

3282.96 --> 3286.28
doesn't change

3290.46 --> 3294.78
yeah

3292.38 --> 3297.96
I mean you can influence how something

3294.78 --> 3299.579
works like adding poison for example

3297.96 --> 3301.26
yeah and then it doesn't really work and

3299.579 --> 3303.0
starts to work differently I have to

3301.26 --> 3305.0400000000004
move around the normal chemistry doesn't

3303.0 --> 3306.42
work whatever

3305.04 --> 3310.74
but

3306.42 --> 3313.44
an effect that is caused

3310.74 --> 3315.7799999999997
through systematic experimentation

3313.44 --> 3318.42
that doesn't change once that's been

3315.78 --> 3319.6800000000003
proved to happen using the scientific

3318.42 --> 3322.859
method

3319.68 --> 3325.52
then it always stays like that it never

3322.859 --> 3325.52
changes

3327.0 --> 3333.059
yeah everything that's ever been proven

3330.0 --> 3335.72
using the scientific method since its

3333.059 --> 3335.7200000000003
Inception

3335.94 --> 3341.339
yeah

3337.76 --> 3343.1400000000003
none of those tests hypothesis tests

3341.339 --> 3346.92
that have been executed and have been

3343.14 --> 3351.24
concluded to be correct correct proven

3346.92 --> 3352.38
science none of them have ever changed

3351.24 --> 3354.72
ever

3352.38 --> 3357.6600000000003
all of them still stand now a lot of

3354.72 --> 3359.339
alternative ways of doing the same thing

3357.66 --> 3362.839
or whatever

3359.339 --> 3365.46
like for example vitamin C like

3362.839 --> 3368.04
preventing scurvy

3365.46 --> 3370.26
I mean this surely there's like other

3368.04 --> 3374.16
ways of dealing with it as well right

3370.26 --> 3376.8590000000004
but that original finding

3374.16 --> 3379.2599999999998
has never changed and it will never

3376.859 --> 3381.359
change there will always be the case

3379.26 --> 3384.8590000000004
like no matter how far in the future we

3381.359 --> 3388.2599999999998
are even in a post-apocalyptic world

3384.859 --> 3391.02
vitamin C however that is attained will

3388.26 --> 3393.3590000000004
still prevent scurvy

3391.02 --> 3395.22
from happening because when everything

3393.359 --> 3396.5989999999997
goes to [ __ ] and suddenly there's no

3395.22 --> 3398.64
more food and all the ground gets

3396.599 --> 3400.92
polluted like it's total fool bar like

3398.64 --> 3403.5
everything dies right there will be

3400.92 --> 3404.819
people with scurvy

3403.5 --> 3408.059
because

3404.819 --> 3409.8
you still need Vitamin C and we get a

3408.059 --> 3413.579
lot we have a lot more nutrient

3409.8 --> 3415.6800000000003
availability now despite like depletion

3413.579 --> 3418.559
of nutrients in the ground so food

3415.68 --> 3421.2599999999998
quality has gone down compared to

3418.559 --> 3423.96
way back

3421.26 --> 3426.119
but there's overall more availability

3423.96 --> 3428.52
anyway

3426.119 --> 3429.96
so when all that availability goes

3428.52 --> 3431.88
completely away and let's just say

3429.96 --> 3434.76
vitamin C suddenly becomes this

3431.88 --> 3436.8
impossible to gain substance and like

3434.76 --> 3437.94
you can't even find lemon trees anymore

3436.8 --> 3440.2200000000003
nothing

3437.94 --> 3442.68
well guess what people are gonna get

3440.22 --> 3445.319
scurvy because that scientifically

3442.68 --> 3448.74
proven fact

3445.319 --> 3452.18
that vitamin C prevents curfew is never

3448.74 --> 3452.18
going to change

3454.859 --> 3460.2599999999998
yeah scientifically proven facts using

3458.64 --> 3462.5989999999997
the scientific method

3460.26 --> 3464.6400000000003
over and over again always having the

3462.599 --> 3467.76
same end result

3464.64 --> 3471.2999999999997
those things never change

3467.76 --> 3473.94
there's not one example in this world

3471.3 --> 3478.1400000000003
where the scientific method has applied

3473.94 --> 3480.7200000000003
successfully repeatedly and then

3478.14 --> 3482.16
certainly a few hundred years later it

3480.72 --> 3483.98
didn't work anymore

3482.16 --> 3487.68
yeah there's

3483.98 --> 3489.48
zero examples of that you huh if there

3487.68 --> 3493.2599999999998
would be an example of that dude that

3489.48 --> 3496.68
would be like a number one conundrum

3493.26 --> 3498.48
that would be at every Wikipedia page

3496.68 --> 3500.22
concerning science I mean that would be

3498.48 --> 3502.619
like wow yeah sometimes it changes

3500.22 --> 3506.5789999999997
here's an example no there is no such

3502.619 --> 3507.96
example because once something a working

3506.579 --> 3512.3390000000004
Within

3507.96 --> 3514.619
the physical world working a mechanism

3512.339 --> 3517.859
the cause of an effect once that has

3514.619 --> 3519.6800000000003
been established and tested

3517.859 --> 3522.5989999999997
and a

3519.68 --> 3524.839
scientific theory is born from it that

3522.599 --> 3529.38
has been proven to be correct

3524.839 --> 3530.88
that never changes ever until the end of

3529.38 --> 3533.339
time

3530.88 --> 3537.059
right you could argue

3533.339 --> 3538.98
you don't create scientific theories you

3537.059 --> 3541.1400000000003
discover them because what you're

3538.98 --> 3545.54
discovering is something that has always

3541.14 --> 3545.54
worked and that shell always work

3547.799 --> 3553.44
but yeah there are some things that

3551.579 --> 3555.299
have always worked and that show always

3553.44 --> 3558.18
worked like the sky has always been blue

3555.299 --> 3561.299
and it shall always be blue

3558.18 --> 3562.98
right but you can't very manipulate

3561.299 --> 3568.02
anything about that

3562.98 --> 3571.579
so it's not science it's just a what is

3568.02 --> 3571.579
question or statement

3571.619 --> 3576.599
right

3573.54 --> 3579.24
but things that causes of effects that

3576.599 --> 3582.3590000000004
have been studied and proven

3579.24 --> 3585.0789999999997
through scientific experimentation they

3582.359 --> 3585.0789999999997
never change

3585.359 --> 3591.68
it's always been

3587.88 --> 3591.6800000000003
and shall always be

3592.799 --> 3597.359
because things that are scientifically

3595.2 --> 3599.0989999999997
proven don't change

3597.359 --> 3602.819
ever

3599.099 --> 3605.6400000000003
if something would change that is

3602.819 --> 3608.64
thought of to be science

3605.64 --> 3611.04
and then people that deal with that

3608.64 --> 3614.16
suddenly say like oh we we used to think

3611.04 --> 3616.92
it was this but now we have new

3614.16 --> 3619.74
information new insights that tell us

3616.92 --> 3623.099
that maybe it wasn't that after it was

3619.74 --> 3624.8999999999996
something else yeah

3623.099 --> 3627.48
if you hear that

3624.9 --> 3631.2000000000003
now you know

3627.48 --> 3634.44
for an absolute proven fact that you're

3631.2 --> 3638.1189999999997
dealing with pseudoscientists

3634.44 --> 3642.66
because scientifically proven things

3638.119 --> 3644.94
never ever change so if somebody's gonna

3642.66 --> 3646.5589999999997
say oh the science it's changed we

3644.94 --> 3650.16
thought it was this but it turned out to

3646.559 --> 3651.48
be this they're Liars or if they don't

3650.16 --> 3652.5
literally don't know what the hell

3651.48 --> 3653.88
they're talking about they're just

3652.5 --> 3656.16
blabbermouths

3653.88 --> 3659.299
they're misinformed idiots that are

3656.16 --> 3659.299
performing pseudoscience

3660.359 --> 3665.94
because

3661.819 --> 3667.44
scientifically proven things causes of

3665.94 --> 3670.079
effects

3667.44 --> 3672.299
don't change

3670.079 --> 3675.599
they never do

3672.299 --> 3678.0
you might find other things that might

3675.599 --> 3681.839
cause the same effect

3678.0 --> 3683.579
on top of what you've proven causes it

3681.839 --> 3686.16
you might find other things but those

3683.579 --> 3687.9
other things don't undo the originally

3686.16 --> 3690.0589999999997
proven thing

3687.9 --> 3691.2000000000003
because once something is scientifically

3690.059 --> 3696.48
proven

3691.2 --> 3697.9399999999996
it will always remain that

3696.48 --> 3701.579
you can't

3697.94 --> 3704.42
unprove something scientifically once

3701.579 --> 3704.42
it's proven

3710.18 --> 3715.799
right and if somebody's gonna blab her

3713.4 --> 3717.96
mouth about all the signs this oh dude

3715.799 --> 3719.819
science has changed well now you know

3717.96 --> 3722.819
immediately

3719.819 --> 3724.5589999999997
like without any other option

3722.819 --> 3727.38
that it could turn out to be you

3724.559 --> 3729.299
immediately know their pseudoscientists

3727.38 --> 3731.6400000000003
immediately

3729.299 --> 3734.52
hear somebody say the CH the signs

3731.64 --> 3736.5
changed they're pseudoscientists science

3734.52 --> 3740.359
never changes

3736.5 --> 3740.359
it never does ever

3741.78 --> 3744.38

supplement on the title

3779.52 --> 3786.24
is anybody gonna say anything in my chat

3783.72 --> 3790.2
are you all content with literally

3786.24 --> 3793.339
having silence for 15 minutes straight

3790.2 --> 3793.339
thanks a lot guys

3794.33 --> 3797.5299999999997
[Music]

3797.94 --> 3801.92
this is my chat no it isn't

3803.41 --> 3810.98
[Music]

3805.64 --> 3810.98
all right I'm gonna just chew this down

3823.44 --> 3825.859
oh

3848.4 --> 3853.64
that's not true

3850.22 --> 3853.64
conspiracy nuts

3853.98 --> 3859.4
yeah you can collect the energy of

3856.859 --> 3859.4
entropy

3860.339 --> 3863.46
and we do

3862.2 --> 3867.0589999999997
yeah

3863.46 --> 3872.0
when you have a wind power turbine

3867.059 --> 3872.0
you are collecting the energy of entropy

3874.559 --> 3880.559
you are collecting the energy of the gas

3877.799 --> 3883.38
pressure trying to find an equilibrium

3880.559 --> 3885.5400000000004
with its surrounding and resulting in

3883.38 --> 3888.119
movement and that movement

3885.54 --> 3890.4
is going to push at whatever is in the

3888.119 --> 3893.28
way of its moving

3890.4 --> 3896.28
including a fan that might drive a

3893.28 --> 3898.7400000000002
turbine and thus the entropy energy is

3896.28 --> 3900.42
collected

3898.74 --> 3902.3999999999996
so I don't know where you're getting

3900.42 --> 3905.54
your information from conspiracy nuts

3902.4 --> 3905.54
you're just incorrect

3910.44 --> 3915.78
yeah

3912.559 --> 3917.7000000000003
and the same goes for heat

3915.78 --> 3920.299
yeah what do you think a nuclear power

3917.7 --> 3920.299
plant is

3920.4 --> 3925.46
it collects

3922.079 --> 3927.2400000000002
the entropy energy of heat

3925.46 --> 3929.64
creates

3927.24 --> 3930.66
water vapor pressure water vapor

3929.64 --> 3933.1189999999997
pressure

3930.66 --> 3937.04
against turbine

3933.119 --> 3937.04
turbine creates electricity

3937.44 --> 3944.9
that's literally the collection of

3940.799 --> 3944.9
energy from entropy

3948.299 --> 3951.74
what's going on

3951.78 --> 3955.52
chat messages are not getting through

3955.68 --> 3960.9199999999996
that's weird

3957.96 --> 3960.92
what the hell's going on

3961.74 --> 3967.4599999999996
smart chat blocked somehow

3964.2 --> 3967.46
what the hell is going on here

3968.46 --> 3973.459
my [ __ ] chat

3970.07 --> 3973.4590000000003
[Music]

3983.46 --> 3986.839
what the hell is this

3990.599 --> 3995.599
why is my freaking chat being blocked

4000.5 --> 4004.72
okay I can still say things in there

4006.76 --> 4010.2490000000003
[Music]

4023.26 --> 4026.4190000000003

4039.579 --> 4044.599
I don't know what the hell's going on

4041.66 --> 4047.2599999999998
but it's it almost seems like the chat's

4044.599 --> 4047.26
been turned off

4062.539 --> 4067.099
what I type didn't come through what the

4065.24 --> 4071.319
[ __ ]

4067.099 --> 4071.319
the chat is completely blocked

4074.299 --> 4079.119
what the hell is going on here

4115.4 --> 4119.5599999999995
I don't understand this at all

4144.5 --> 4150.02
okay so apparently my chats now shut

4148.4 --> 4152.839
down

4150.02 --> 4154.9400000000005
it's still sitting there but I'm

4152.839 --> 4156.859
literally getting people in Skype

4154.94 --> 4160.48
telling me how they're typing all kinds

4156.859 --> 4160.4800000000005
of stuff and they don't get through

4160.759 --> 4166.88
so and I try to type something and then

4163.819 --> 4170.0
when I refreshed it disappeared so my

4166.88 --> 4172.64
chats just turn off

4170.0 --> 4175.6
like everybody's blocked in my chat now

4172.64 --> 4175.6
for some reason

4178.94 --> 4185.139999999999
Maybe restart the show

4182.42 --> 4185.14
okay

4196.63 --> 4199.869
[Music]

4203.96 --> 4206.96
foreign

4210.28 --> 4215.599999999999
okay I'm gonna restart the show

4213.62 --> 4218.42
because whatever the hell happened with

4215.6 --> 4221.92
YouTube it seemed to have like broken

4218.42 --> 4221.92
how the chat works

4225.26 --> 4231.52
really disappointed and you YouTube like

4228.08 --> 4231.5199999999995
what the [ __ ] are you doing man

4233.96 --> 4238.219
doesn't make any damn sense I really

4236.6 --> 4242.38
hope fds that I'm gonna have these

4238.219 --> 4242.38
issues I mean this is like a bad issue

4246.679 --> 4254.679
another attempt at self-sabotage from

4249.8 --> 4254.679
the YouTube crowd great

4255.86 --> 4258.88
so anyway

4259.1 --> 4264.320000000001
I guess I'll just round it out but I

4262.04 --> 4266.54
will start up a new little show in which

4264.32 --> 4269.42
I'm not gonna do an intro

4266.54 --> 4271.64
so thanks everyone for coming

4269.42 --> 4274.88
uh nobody can say anything in the chat

4271.64 --> 4277.64
anymore so keep it short thanks everyone

4274.88 --> 4279.08
for coming I hope you like this show if

4277.64 --> 4281.179
you did then please don't forget to
