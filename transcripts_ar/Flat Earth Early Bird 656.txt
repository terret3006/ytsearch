this point very much needed

79.36 --> 83.119
actually running into a

84.84 --> 89.28
deadlock

86.56 --> 89.28
and yeah

89.68 --> 93.04
i'm just gonna figure out what have i

91.759 --> 96.64
have to do about that

93.04 --> 98.64
to get around but

96.64 --> 100.0
yeah in the meantime i'll just keep the

98.64 --> 105.43900000000001

105.439 --> 112.63999999999999
yeah running out of coffee

109.04 --> 112.64
so yeah maybe the next

112.799 --> 117.68
week or so i won't be having coffee it

115.28 --> 121.28
all depends

117.68 --> 123.52000000000001
priorities you know food comes first

121.28 --> 123.52
uh

124.799 --> 130.0
right so anyway the weather

128.239 --> 131.36
the weather is actually quite nice

130.0 --> 132.239
although yeah right now it's a bit

131.36 --> 136.16000000000003
cloudy but

132.239 --> 136.16
this morning there was just a lot of sun

137.52 --> 140.72
and apparently the weather is going to

139.84 --> 144.4
get

140.72 --> 147.44
kind of warm warmish again

144.4 --> 149.84
so i've heard so kind of looking forward

147.44 --> 149.84
to that

150.48 --> 154.0
and yeah pretty beautiful

154.08 --> 160.959
no chemtrail remnants sky lip

157.68 --> 160.959
looks pretty blue up there

163.44 --> 167.12
yeah and barely any wind

167.36 --> 173.46
something i've noticed anyway

170.41 --> 173.46
[Music]

176.239 --> 183.12
right so let's use in chat so far

179.68 --> 185.84
roger was first obermoco anna koala

183.12 --> 185.84
let's see you

191.61 --> 200.959
[Music]

195.599 --> 205.04
yeah so how have you all been doing

200.959 --> 210.08
my day was very long yesterday

205.04 --> 210.07999999999998
very very very long yeah

210.799 --> 215.20000000000002
because i don't know uh the flatter

214.239 --> 217.76
debate happened

215.2 --> 220.23899999999998
after the early bird show yesterday was

217.76 --> 220.239
pretty good

220.56 --> 226.159
uh nothing extraordinarily new

223.68 --> 228.72
didn't overall say that much but

226.159 --> 230.39999999999998
everybody was very rampassy

228.72 --> 232.48
and at some point i think it was in the

230.4 --> 236.08
after show i did get kind of pissed off

232.48 --> 240.39999999999998
because basically asking can i please

236.08 --> 243.04000000000002
just finish what my trainer thought

240.4 --> 244.48000000000002
without halfway people starting to just

243.04 --> 247.28
talk over it

244.48 --> 249.35999999999999
because that seemed to happen every time

247.28 --> 250.159
so i got a bit pissed off at one point

249.36 --> 251.43900000000002
but

250.159 --> 253.439
other than that it was pretty

251.439 --> 256.829
interesting

253.439 --> 258.56
a lot about just media propaganda and

256.829 --> 261.44
[Music]

258.56 --> 263.36
yeah perspective on the whole situation

261.44 --> 267.12
from different angles

263.36 --> 269.28000000000003
so yeah not even all about flat earth

267.12 --> 270.96
but yeah that's also involved of course

269.28 --> 273.44
uh

270.96 --> 274.79999999999995
yeah um benjamin was also live pretty

273.44 --> 279.68
good

274.8 --> 279.68
he can't uh i don't know he was on about

280.479 --> 285.199
i know apparently some substance but i

283.68 --> 288.08
couldn't

285.199 --> 290.88
really make out what it was i heard like

288.08 --> 293.84
dhd or something like

290.88 --> 295.199
something it was basically putting down

293.84 --> 298.56
that

295.199 --> 300.96000000000004
people super beefed up

298.56 --> 303.52
were basically getting dependent on

300.96 --> 305.84
doctors for basically doing it for them

303.52 --> 309.44
because

305.84 --> 311.11999999999995
yeah they yeah they get addicted to the

309.44 --> 314.479
peak activity and then

311.12 --> 318.24
eventually ender endocrine

314.479 --> 319.52
exhaustion and then completely dependent

318.24 --> 322.639
on

319.52 --> 326.24
yeah outside injected drugs and it

322.639 --> 328.479
yeah he got a good point there

326.24 --> 332.40000000000003
i thought i don't know i didn't know

328.479 --> 332.4
what did the proper short was but

332.88 --> 336.88
did know that the endocrine system has

335.36 --> 340.47900000000004
everything to do with it

336.88 --> 343.36
and i get that point i even take it like

340.479 --> 344.71999999999997
myself in the sense that very careful

343.36 --> 348.47900000000004
with that

344.72 --> 351.6
i'm not trying to like

348.479 --> 353.84
stretch out everything i got and

351.6 --> 355.199
not like tapping into all the potential

353.84 --> 358.88
just yet

355.199 --> 361.91900000000004
very slow grow or careful grower

358.88 --> 365.44
of myself anyway

361.919 --> 368.24
uh yeah and also caught

365.44 --> 368.96
late night stream from rodrigo ferrari

368.24 --> 372.56
nunez

368.96 --> 376.71999999999997
and he was extensively reviewing the

372.56 --> 380.08
what is it that article how to

376.72 --> 383.759
fight a flat earther what was that

380.08 --> 383.75899999999996
exact title again i don't remember

384.319 --> 388.08000000000004
how to deal with it uh let me try to

386.4 --> 392.4
find it back

388.08 --> 392.4
title how to

392.88 --> 395.84
what's it

398.8 --> 403.44
where somebody must have posted it

401.68 --> 405.6
somewhere

403.44 --> 408.8
oh how to debate a flat earther yeah

405.6 --> 413.44
right that that's the one

408.8 --> 415.68
so yeah he read

413.44 --> 418.24
he pretty much in like more than three

415.68 --> 418.88
hours went through the whole damn thing

418.24 --> 421.52
because it's

418.88 --> 422.479
huge he had some other people's writings

421.52 --> 425.68
involved

422.479 --> 426.24
as well and just laying out how the the

425.68 --> 430.24
deep

426.24 --> 434.84000000000003
baller dream strategy works these days

430.24 --> 436.56
and i had a lot of feedback also in his

434.84 --> 439.599
chat

436.56 --> 442.479
that i gave in response because it yeah

439.599 --> 444.56
he really highlighted every detail like

442.479 --> 446.8
went over it with a fine-tooth comb as

444.56 --> 448.96
it were

446.8 --> 450.08
and yeah i'm not typically a guy that's

448.96 --> 453.35999999999996
like oh yay

450.08 --> 456.88
some nasa story talker article

453.36 --> 460.0
of 40 pages let me just go through that

456.88 --> 460.8
oh you know i'm not all that much about

460.0 --> 464.479
reading

460.8 --> 466.72
so i'm actually very glad that he did

464.479 --> 466.71999999999997
that

468.4 --> 473.75899999999996
because then i got to absorb it verbally

471.52 --> 475.19899999999996
works better for me like if it's a

473.759 --> 478.0
combination verbally

475.199 --> 478.8
and visually then it's easier for me to

478.0 --> 482.16
keep track

478.8 --> 484.96000000000004
anyway it's a very good stream so i hung

482.16 --> 485.59900000000005
in there until the very end and that was

484.96 --> 488.87899999999996
late

485.599 --> 493.599
very late i don't know somewhere near

488.879 --> 497.199
three o'clock

493.599 --> 499.919
right so hello

497.199 --> 499.91900000000004
glass shaw

501.599 --> 508.24
amanda jung good to see you right

511.199 --> 515.6800000000001
yeah right before this i was watching um

518.0 --> 522.8
forget which yeah jason of the disbury

521.599 --> 525.839
family and he's

522.8 --> 525.8389999999999
they're doing like this

526.0 --> 532.32
uh not flat earth but

529.76 --> 534.3199999999999
more against the the corona lockdown and

532.32 --> 537.44
all that masks and

534.32 --> 539.6
just the orwellian crackdown

537.44 --> 541.2790000000001
they're doing yeah some how do you call

539.6 --> 543.6
it a public excursion

541.279 --> 545.36
they're on the streets with the bullhorn

543.6 --> 550.08
talking to people and

545.36 --> 552.9590000000001
like some i was just watching that he

550.08 --> 552.9590000000001
what is that

556.88 --> 563.8389999999999
okay yeah

567.36 --> 572.64
okay yeah sleeping warrior just posted a

574.839 --> 579.44
video

576.399 --> 582.56
some judicial related situation

579.44 --> 585.0400000000001
hmm may need to watch that video

582.56 --> 586.56
carefully after this somewhere

585.04 --> 590.88
it's only eight and a half minutes long

586.56 --> 593.279
but it does look interesting

590.88 --> 594.88
because of some remark boris johnson

593.279 --> 598.48
claimed

594.88 --> 601.4399999999999
new laws on corona coronavirus

598.48 --> 602.16
have been reduced from the rule of 20 to

601.44 --> 604.72
the rule of

602.16 --> 606.8
six i don't even know what that means

604.72 --> 608.64
anyway that's his video that just popped

606.8 --> 612.16
up so

608.64 --> 619.8389999999999
that caught my attention uh

612.16 --> 619.8389999999999
hey agm by the way

627.6 --> 633.839
yeah that's not gonna happen hey julia

630.88 --> 633.8389999999999
up heaven

637.86 --> 643.429
[Music]

653.92 --> 656.64
right so

657.2 --> 661.12
yeah that's pretty much it for from

659.36 --> 661.839
activities uh you have just playing

661.12 --> 665.76
games

661.839 --> 666.32
other than that trying to take it easy

665.76 --> 668.56
i've been

666.32 --> 670.24
cutting down on my beard drinking

668.56 --> 675.8389999999999
overall

670.24 --> 675.839
it's working it's actually helping too

686.959 --> 692.959
and i'm smoking a lot less so i'm

690.72 --> 694.0790000000001
basically getting ready for like this

692.959 --> 696.0
period of

694.079 --> 699.5999999999999
maybe two weeks where i'm gonna be very

696.0 --> 703.839
tight and just focusing on food

699.6 --> 703.839
dude get out of here

716.56 --> 719.8389999999999
yeah i think we got some trolls very

719.2 --> 722.0790000000001
annoying

719.839 --> 722.0790000000001
yet

728.639 --> 734.399
all right agm it's on public gatherings

732.0 --> 734.399
all right

737.12 --> 740.9590000000001
yeah curious to see where that'll go

741.519 --> 746.079
because yeah there is a lot of this

743.92 --> 749.4399999999999
stuff going on it really seems

746.079 --> 753.519
like seems

749.44 --> 753.519
because it's not absolute

753.6 --> 759.76
but things are changing and

756.639 --> 763.12
yeah it seems like there is a big

759.76 --> 766.3199999999999
orwellian move from

763.12 --> 768.48
government and corporations downward to

766.32 --> 771.519
the general public

768.48 --> 774.5600000000001
particularly targeting the gullible

771.519 --> 777.04
particularly but

774.56 --> 779.5999999999999
that's it there's a whole lot of fakery

777.04 --> 781.5999999999999
in between it's very tough

779.6 --> 783.9200000000001
to be absolutely you can't just say it's

781.6 --> 786.5600000000001
all everything i'm seeing is all fake or

783.92 --> 800.56
it's all real

786.56 --> 804.8
and there's just trickery going on

800.56 --> 804.8
okay right

805.2 --> 809.36
so yeah i look me personally there's not

808.48 --> 812.0
a lot of

809.36 --> 814.0790000000001
stuff that i can do about this except

812.0 --> 816.8
for point it out to others but yeah

814.079 --> 818.3199999999999
if if i have to if some random guy in

816.8 --> 822.16
youtube has to point

818.32 --> 824.5600000000001
this out to you that's

822.16 --> 825.92
yeah seems kind of superfluous because

824.56 --> 828.88
nobody would ever even

825.92 --> 829.5999999999999
get to my channel at this point without

828.88 --> 833.6
having been

829.6 --> 835.839
abundantly pointed out to them

833.6 --> 837.839
that there's a lot of fakery going on in

835.839 --> 842.8000000000001
the media

837.839 --> 844.48
you're not gonna go to harwin channel

842.8 --> 846.399
or maybe i'm wrong maybe some random

844.48 --> 850.32
person will be like oh arwen

846.399 --> 852.56
okay well let's see what this

850.32 --> 853.839
is and then suddenly i pointed out to

852.56 --> 856.959
them yeah

853.839 --> 859.2790000000001
there's a lot of fakery in the media

856.959 --> 859.279
and

861.36 --> 867.6
yeah there is crisis acting

864.399 --> 870.639
it's a very high trigger word for

867.6 --> 872.9590000000001
for the corporations very high trigger

870.639 --> 873.6800000000001
there's a lot of crisis acts going on in

872.959 --> 876.2399999999999
between

873.68 --> 877.5999999999999
real situations and that's the crappy

876.24 --> 881.36
part

877.6 --> 881.76
because on one hand they want to cover

881.36 --> 884.88
up

881.76 --> 886.8
judicially sensitive situations

884.88 --> 887.92
as in people that are getting like

886.8 --> 890.4799999999999
mauled

887.92 --> 892.0
by the police or something that could

890.48 --> 895.12
then afterwards

892.0 --> 896.639
sue them and sue the whole county or

895.12 --> 899.04
whatever you know

896.639 --> 900.16
they don't like that to get attention

899.04 --> 903.519
but what they do

900.16 --> 906.7199999999999
like is people getting [ __ ] up

903.519 --> 911.519
anxious nervous

906.72 --> 914.639
or paranoid over seeing such things

911.519 --> 917.92
so what do they do i think

914.639 --> 921.519
there's leads to this they create

917.92 --> 924.959
fake situation crackdowns

921.519 --> 926.72
in between the real thing and then the

924.959 --> 928.7199999999999
real thing kind of gets shoved to the

926.72 --> 930.8000000000001
background and then the fakeries get

928.72 --> 933.44
shoved to the foreground

930.8 --> 934.079
so that people will get caught up on

933.44 --> 937.2790000000001
that

934.079 --> 939.3599999999999
get all hyped up hyped up about it use

937.279 --> 941.68
specifically those

939.36 --> 945.44
crisis acts which have been shoved

941.68 --> 948.8
forward basically made readily available

945.44 --> 950.0790000000001
for their case which in the end will

948.8 --> 952.24
probably lead you

950.079 --> 953.7589999999999
judicially to that they have no case

952.24 --> 955.04
because it actually turned out to be a

953.759 --> 958.16
crisis act

955.04 --> 962.079
see is this this is like super

958.16 --> 965.04
heavy psychological judicial warfare

962.079 --> 967.3599999999999
that's actually happening and it's

965.04 --> 970.88
basically to extinguish the last

967.36 --> 974.399
remaining resistance of people within

970.88 --> 978.959
society that are trying to stop

974.399 --> 978.959
these maniacs from taking total control

979.6 --> 985.12
like total control through

982.12 --> 985.12
demoralization

985.199 --> 989.4399999999999
because if everybody just gets a

987.68 --> 991.279
headache it just hurts they don't want

989.44 --> 993.9200000000001
to know about it anymore

991.279 --> 995.519
guess what it's all gonna just slip them

993.92 --> 997.36
by and they're just gonna

995.519 --> 999.44
try to work their way through to

997.36 --> 1002.32
whatever next step they need to get like

999.44 --> 1003.839
food or whatever they won't do anything

1002.32 --> 1008.399
about it anymore

1003.839 --> 1008.399
see total mind control through

1008.839 --> 1013.12
demoralization

1010.56 --> 1013.92
so that's a big part of what's really

1013.12 --> 1018.0
going on it's

1013.92 --> 1021.5999999999999
really tough it's and it is really tough

1018.0 --> 1023.04
you know maybe 10 20 years ago as an

1021.6 --> 1024.72
outsider

1023.04 --> 1026.3999999999999
there was nothing tough about it you

1024.72 --> 1028.48
just they be like oh

1026.4 --> 1030.64
no this is ridiculous no i'm with the

1028.48 --> 1033.76
media because

1030.64 --> 1035.6000000000001
it makes me feel safe i believe

1033.76 --> 1037.52
them and it's fine you know because i

1035.6 --> 1038.319
can do my life it's all nice well guess

1037.52 --> 1042.0
what now

1038.319 --> 1043.76
it's not entirely like that anymore for

1042.0 --> 1047.199
a lot of people

1043.76 --> 1050.72
so it's getting like yeah

1047.199 --> 1052.96
in their way in the same part

1050.72 --> 1055.52
time people that have been trying to go

1052.96 --> 1056.88
against that wake people up

1055.52 --> 1059.28
they're getting more momentum they're

1056.88 --> 1062.0
building more skill in their fight

1059.28 --> 1062.0
against it

1062.32 --> 1066.52
but they are now confronted with just

1064.88 --> 1070.4
increasingly more

1066.52 --> 1072.48
sophisticated fake information placement

1070.4 --> 1073.44
fake crisis acts in between real

1072.48 --> 1077.6
situations

1073.44 --> 1080.88
and used for propaganda

1077.6 --> 1082.799
tinkering and even for wider plants

1080.88 --> 1085.2800000000002
because i think that for example a lot

1082.799 --> 1089.2
of the things we got to see

1085.28 --> 1092.48
in china in the early kuronu

1089.2 --> 1093.52
crisis reveal i think most of what we

1092.48 --> 1097.039
got to see

1093.52 --> 1099.52
was pure crisis act it was absolutely

1097.039 --> 1100.16
fake with nobody actually even sick in

1099.52 --> 1103.84
there

1100.16 --> 1107.039
it was all extremely dramatic

1103.84 --> 1109.84
and that was used as a pretext to

1107.039 --> 1109.84
basically

1110.0 --> 1117.919
pull the nerve strengths of the public

1114.64 --> 1121.1200000000001
so it was used like that but it was

1117.919 --> 1123.76
fake it was completely fake there was

1121.12 --> 1124.3999999999999
literally nothing happening there

1123.76 --> 1127.44
because

1124.4 --> 1129.039
of the reasons suggested i'm sure a lot

1127.44 --> 1134.3200000000002
of people died

1129.039 --> 1137.679
sure but not because of what they said

1134.32 --> 1139.9189999999999
because yeah china has

1137.679 --> 1141.44
no uh yeah what do you call it

1139.919 --> 1144.96
objections

1141.44 --> 1148.72
when it comes to just killing people if

1144.96 --> 1148.72
they have a reason for it in their

1148.84 --> 1151.84
country

1152.4 --> 1156.3200000000002
but that doesn't mean that what we got

1154.16 --> 1158.24
to see was actually real was a crisis

1156.32 --> 1161.76
act and it was used

1158.24 --> 1165.6
as a pretext to

1161.76 --> 1169.76
ram through this entire world

1165.6 --> 1172.9599999999998
medical crisis scenario

1169.76 --> 1175.52
based on fakery clear

1172.96 --> 1175.52
fakery

1176.08 --> 1180.1599999999999
you know it's and it's not the first

1178.24 --> 1183.28
time this happened remember in syria

1180.16 --> 1186.24
with the supposed syrian gas attacks

1183.28 --> 1186.799
that was a complete nonsensical crisis

1186.24 --> 1188.799
act two

1186.799 --> 1190.96
and that was even like proven there was

1188.799 --> 1196.0
even video of it

1190.96 --> 1199.76
side video well it was used

1196.0 --> 1201.52
to fool the people into trying to get

1199.76 --> 1204.799
some war going

1201.52 --> 1208.72
right so yeah that happens

1204.799 --> 1212.0
literal fake things happen

1208.72 --> 1214.32
you know you got false flags

1212.0 --> 1216.0
when when she really [ __ ] starts to hit

1214.32 --> 1217.9189999999999
the fan it usually

1216.0 --> 1220.96
starts with false flags you know but

1217.919 --> 1223.3600000000001
that's not happening right now at least

1220.96 --> 1225.28
that far as i'm aware of though i'm not

1223.36 --> 1226.24
specifically focused on that sort of

1225.28 --> 1229.52
thing

1226.24 --> 1232.88
but crisis acting

1229.52 --> 1234.0
it happens all the time and once you

1232.88 --> 1237.0390000000002
start to figure that out

1234.0 --> 1241.12
then it becomes even scarier

1237.039 --> 1244.24
when you look back and realize

1241.12 --> 1247.36
how many times you've already seen

1244.24 --> 1250.159
crisis acts had a particular

1247.36 --> 1252.3999999999999
odd feeling about it but then latched on

1250.159 --> 1254.48
to another interpretation of that

1252.4 --> 1257.44
feeling and now you're seeing it like

1254.48 --> 1259.2
holy [ __ ] that was completely fake

1257.44 --> 1260.96
there was nothing there that was an

1259.2 --> 1263.3600000000001
actor

1260.96 --> 1265.2
a bad actor compared like they're

1263.36 --> 1267.1999999999998
getting better

1265.2 --> 1268.48
not all of it you know sometimes there's

1267.2 --> 1270.799
like this mask

1268.48 --> 1272.64
acting especially when there's like

1270.799 --> 1274.96
younger people or teenagers involved

1272.64 --> 1278.7990000000002
then it gets really stupid

1274.96 --> 1279.679
shitty but way back crisis acting was

1278.799 --> 1283.2
pretty bad

1279.679 --> 1284.0
a lot of the time well now they seem to

1283.2 --> 1286.48
be

1284.0 --> 1289.12
putting more effort into it slightly

1286.48 --> 1292.0
more effort

1289.12 --> 1294.559
and i'm talking about the last few years

1292.0 --> 1294.559
building up

1295.36 --> 1299.9189999999999
but yeah it's in between there and it's

1297.84 --> 1301.12
just to me that was a real shocking

1299.919 --> 1304.24
realization like

1301.12 --> 1307.52
holy [ __ ] so much

1304.24 --> 1310.64
is actually just acted like i

1307.52 --> 1312.0
personally have no proof could even find

1310.64 --> 1313.919
through the internet now that the

1312.0 --> 1317.52
internet's here because yeah 20 years

1313.919 --> 1317.5200000000002
ago it wasn't really that good

1317.679 --> 1322.0800000000002
that yeah no proof something is actually

1320.64 --> 1325.679
real

1322.08 --> 1326.32
no after math that reveals that it was

1325.679 --> 1330.64
actually

1326.32 --> 1331.4399999999998
real you get to see the victim surviving

1330.64 --> 1335.2
or whatever

1331.44 --> 1339.039
with actual wounds like

1335.2 --> 1343.039
clear distinct testimonies

1339.039 --> 1346.24
reports coronary coronary reports

1343.039 --> 1350.0
corn yep yeah so

1346.24 --> 1361.84
crisis acts i guess that's

1350.0 --> 1361.84
a subject for for today

1374.799 --> 1378.1589999999999
okay i'm glad nobody's following what

1376.88 --> 1381.44
i'm talking about

1378.159 --> 1381.44
i'm not unmuting right

1386.84 --> 1389.84
now

1396.4 --> 1402.3200000000002
right also yeah another little detail

1399.919 --> 1406.48
about crisis acting

1402.32 --> 1409.6789999999999
it's not always like ooh a cia

1406.48 --> 1414.799
agent that has a plan to fool

1409.679 --> 1417.8400000000001
the public for a nefarious cause

1414.799 --> 1421.36
sometimes it's actually people

1417.84 --> 1423.36
working along with government

1421.36 --> 1425.52
and government agent of some kind to

1423.36 --> 1429.36
kind of

1425.52 --> 1431.84
in their minds promote a necessary

1429.36 --> 1434.6399999999999
thing that needs to happen so they help

1431.84 --> 1437.4399999999998
for a political cause for example

1434.64 --> 1439.8400000000001
you know well when with the wuhan

1437.44 --> 1442.88
situation there's no way that could be

1439.84 --> 1444.08
actually said they either were doing

1442.88 --> 1446.64
that to cover up something

1444.08 --> 1447.9189999999999
terrible and then yeah volunteers as it

1446.64 --> 1451.039
were

1447.919 --> 1452.7990000000002
they're not just going to do that out of

1451.039 --> 1454.96
the sense of duty

1452.799 --> 1456.559
unless they get a huge payoff or

1454.96 --> 1458.48
something a huge

1456.559 --> 1459.9189999999999
big enough payoff or they would have to

1458.48 --> 1462.0
be completely threatened

1459.919 --> 1464.4
with their with death they didn't

1462.0 --> 1467.76
cooperate something like that

1464.4 --> 1470.799
because yeah

1467.76 --> 1471.279
no no person will be fooled into into

1470.799 --> 1473.12
doing

1471.279 --> 1475.12
going along with such a crisis act

1473.12 --> 1478.1589999999999
because it's just terrible

1475.12 --> 1481.6789999999999
like what good will it do to the country

1478.159 --> 1485.3600000000001
to fake a disease being somewhere it's

1481.679 --> 1485.3600000000001
right it's demoralizing and

1485.76 --> 1489.279
from a public point of view from a

1488.24 --> 1491.919
party-state

1489.279 --> 1493.6
controlling point of view sure but

1491.919 --> 1496.72
that's

1493.6 --> 1498.799
not supposed to be well that

1496.72 --> 1500.159
shouldn't be the mindset of the public

1498.799 --> 1502.6399999999999
at least you know

1500.159 --> 1504.0
like people in the military okay the

1502.64 --> 1507.8400000000001
political party itself

1504.0 --> 1509.6
okay maybe so yeah crisis acting

1507.84 --> 1512.84
it's very complicated how it works

1509.6 --> 1516.8799999999999
sometimes people get drawn in to help

1512.84 --> 1516.8799999999999
out and

1516.96 --> 1523.3600000000001
that might have sort of even happened to

1520.24 --> 1525.279
me at some point but i'm not sure

1523.36 --> 1527.4399999999998
because it might also have been a dark

1525.279 --> 1531.919
world experience

1527.44 --> 1534.24
can't say for sure literally

1531.919 --> 1537.2
was it if that physically happened it

1534.24 --> 1541.76
happened in a very weird time

1537.2 --> 1543.3600000000001
where i was very confused

1541.76 --> 1546.32
probably would have come across like

1543.36 --> 1549.76
that kind of like a

1546.32 --> 1551.9189999999999
sjw confusion type feel would come off

1549.76 --> 1551.919
me

1554.64 --> 1559.2
but yeah i would just from it like a

1557.12 --> 1559.84
statist point of view be like yeah of

1559.2 --> 1563.679
course

1559.84 --> 1565.52
need i'll help you i'll help you

1563.679 --> 1568.8400000000001
fool the public if that's what you think

1565.52 --> 1571.279
is necessary very naive very naive

1568.84 --> 1573.12
terrible

1571.279 --> 1575.6
but yeah he was still in relief back

1573.12 --> 1575.6
then that

1576.32 --> 1582.559
that somehow they were the good guys

1579.6 --> 1583.36
it was just all very complicated just so

1582.559 --> 1586.24
naive

1583.36 --> 1587.1999999999998
terrible i feel terrible even saying it

1586.24 --> 1590.799
but that's

1587.2 --> 1593.52
yeah that's where my my mind was at

1590.799 --> 1595.84
it's very embarrassing i'm just glad

1593.52 --> 1595.84
that i

1596.24 --> 1603.44
kind of slipped out and stayed out

1599.679 --> 1606.0800000000002
and then slipped further away from the

1603.44 --> 1613.8400000000001
last remnants of people that are kind of

1606.08 --> 1613.84
associated with that

1618.96 --> 1622.72
ah but i guess that

1622.88 --> 1629.679
none of you are really paying attention

1627.279 --> 1629.679
whatever

1630.96 --> 1636.4
merkel speech won some weeks before the

1634.159 --> 1639.0390000000002
outbreak and one market

1636.4 --> 1640.0
oh yeah yeah there was so much weird

1639.039 --> 1643.279
stuff going on but

1640.0 --> 1646.799
seriously the whole wuhan thing

1643.279 --> 1646.799
that's been planned forever

1647.64 --> 1653.679
2012. i had

1650.72 --> 1654.08
like precursors to that i was basically

1653.679 --> 1656.159
told

1654.08 --> 1658.48
to me like yeah we're gonna do that and

1656.159 --> 1662.0800000000002
i was like

1658.48 --> 1662.08
i don't want to have anything to do with

1666.84 --> 1669.84
that

1671.76 --> 1683.84
all right thanks for the feedback agm

1697.679 --> 1704.0800000000002
all right anyway

1701.44 --> 1704.64
if anyone wants to move on perhaps

1704.08 --> 1711.1999999999998
because

1704.64 --> 1714.5590000000002
yeah this subject is

1711.2 --> 1718.48
you know what can you say

1714.559 --> 1721.52
i don't look at this point protesting

1718.48 --> 1723.76
doesn't really seem that useful anymore

1721.52 --> 1725.52
spreading awareness breaking people out

1723.76 --> 1728.8799999999999
of their subservient

1725.52 --> 1733.84
trance that's a good thing i guess

1728.88 --> 1736.24
it's very tough but it is necessary

1733.84 --> 1737.1999999999998
and i admire people that do that at this

1736.24 --> 1738.3990000000001
point

1737.2 --> 1740.24
because you're going to deal with a lot

1738.399 --> 1743.279
of brainwashing and a lot of just

1740.24 --> 1743.279
idiot idiots

1743.84 --> 1748.399
yeah that think that it's all wrong live

1746.32 --> 1750.48
in a reverse world that are just

1748.399 --> 1751.84
idiots and but yeah that they're going

1750.48 --> 1752.799
to be around they're going to grow in

1751.84 --> 1755.84
numbers

1752.799 --> 1758.95
unfortunately as time passes the same

1755.84 --> 1760.24
time just protest doesn't help

1758.95 --> 1763.279
[Music]

1760.24 --> 1764.84
so for me what i'm thinking about is

1763.279 --> 1766.96
okay i'm just going to be a

1764.84 --> 1768.399
constitutionalist

1766.96 --> 1771.2
because there's a constitution

1768.399 --> 1773.76
everywhere and there is kind of a rule

1771.2 --> 1776.72
a rule of fist if it breaks the

1773.76 --> 1776.72
constitution

1777.52 --> 1784.96
like even retroactively then

1781.84 --> 1788.08
it's just not lawful you could say

1784.96 --> 1790.799
it's a mistake it was a conspiracy

1788.08 --> 1793.039
but it's not lawful so you technically

1790.799 --> 1796.08
don't need to abide now people could be

1793.039 --> 1798.8799999999999
fooled from within not

1796.08 --> 1799.6
seeing this that they will be thuggishly

1798.88 --> 1802.64
out of

1799.6 --> 1805.84
mind control will try to make you forced

1802.64 --> 1808.24
to do it anyway and that is illegal

1805.84 --> 1810.0
but yeah you could hold them account

1808.24 --> 1812.159
afterward but they'll probably be

1810.0 --> 1814.399
that be like what the [ __ ] man i didn't

1812.159 --> 1816.159
even know that

1814.399 --> 1817.84
they were just caught up in it so it's

1816.159 --> 1822.3200000000002
just this weird

1817.84 --> 1825.52
giant spell layered situation

1822.32 --> 1826.08
and you don't need to abide by these

1825.52 --> 1828.6399999999999
rules

1826.08 --> 1830.799
because they are illegal but you got to

1828.64 --> 1832.0800000000002
deal with the thugs and the mind control

1830.799 --> 1835.6
victims that think

1832.08 --> 1836.559
that it is legal that's that's the real

1835.6 --> 1839.84
challenge

1836.559 --> 1841.279
how do you do that how can you go around

1839.84 --> 1844.799
well

1841.279 --> 1847.279
the only real way you can do it is by

1844.799 --> 1849.279
snapping other people out of that trance

1847.279 --> 1852.399
especially people

1849.279 --> 1852.399
that have businesses

1853.279 --> 1856.48
you know because i think that at this

1855.52 --> 1859.6
point the whole

1856.48 --> 1860.24
fine situation right fines you'd get if

1859.6 --> 1863.039
you not

1860.24 --> 1864.96
buy by corona rules technically that's

1863.039 --> 1868.559
illegal

1864.96 --> 1868.559
they cannot enforce that

1868.799 --> 1873.279
now if they enforce that that's how are

1871.919 --> 1875.6000000000001
they gonna do that are they gonna

1873.279 --> 1876.799
like send swat teams or something or is

1875.6 --> 1880.1589999999999
it just gonna

1876.799 --> 1882.96
fall in the giant heap of

1880.159 --> 1885.0390000000002
that claims you know because if they're

1882.96 --> 1885.679
gonna just swat team people over that

1885.039 --> 1889.6
[ __ ] now

1885.679 --> 1891.679
then then they're really really breaking

1889.6 --> 1895.1999999999998
the rules

1891.679 --> 1895.2
like very seriously

1896.96 --> 1900.72
i i don't know how high that how high

1899.679 --> 1902.72
level

1900.72 --> 1905.3600000000001
that is but might be up the trees in

1902.72 --> 1908.88
this levels it's just like

1905.36 --> 1911.4399999999998
literally robbing people

1908.88 --> 1912.72
robbing them if they're if government is

1911.44 --> 1915.519
gonna do that

1912.72 --> 1917.2
well then we're on another tier i don't

1915.519 --> 1919.44
know how to deal with that

1917.2 --> 1921.039
what the proper response could be even

1919.44 --> 1923.8400000000001
to such scenarios

1921.039 --> 1926.08
but where are the people that are trying

1923.84 --> 1926.08
this

1926.24 --> 1931.679
because if you just keep things open and

1929.519 --> 1932.96
literally ignore it but going by the

1931.679 --> 1936.159
constitution

1932.96 --> 1939.1200000000001
finding a way through it then yeah

1936.159 --> 1939.7600000000002
maybe the fines could simply be ignored

1939.12 --> 1942.559
because

1939.76 --> 1943.6
they are technically illegal and then if

1942.559 --> 1947.84
it is basically

1943.6 --> 1950.7199999999998
enforced or an another type of assault

1947.84 --> 1950.72
on the business

1951.12 --> 1954.4799999999998
that's also illegal

1954.559 --> 1958.96
unless there's all these contractual

1957.44 --> 1961.44
situations where

1958.96 --> 1963.919
as a business owner you basically sign

1961.44 --> 1967.279
up on yes

1963.919 --> 1969.679
my name here my signing signature

1967.279 --> 1971.519
that i am going to go along with the

1969.679 --> 1975.039
corona rules

1971.519 --> 1976.08
basically or something you know so why

1975.039 --> 1978.24
don't we figure this

1976.08 --> 1979.84
out literally why don't people come out

1978.24 --> 1980.88
like i'm a business owner i got a

1979.84 --> 1983.039
problem because i

1980.88 --> 1984.64
signed this piece of paper that says i'm

1983.039 --> 1985.6
abiding by the coroner rules or

1984.64 --> 1988.96
something or

1985.6 --> 1990.799
medical pandemic situa you know we need

1988.96 --> 1994.32
to know this

1990.799 --> 1998.6399999999999
that is important this is critical

1994.32 --> 2002.72
how can we keep things open bypassing

1998.64 --> 2005.279
the entire illegal medical

2002.72 --> 2005.76
crackdowns crackdown situation on the

2005.279 --> 2008.48
public

2005.76 --> 2010.72
how do we bypass this how do we keep

2008.48 --> 2012.88
things running

2010.72 --> 2014.48
you know just knowing it isn't good

2012.88 --> 2016.3200000000002
enough

2014.48 --> 2018.799
you know because if everything closes

2016.32 --> 2019.12
down and you're not in some rural area

2018.799 --> 2020.72
where

2019.12 --> 2022.6399999999999
just a lot of people have their own food

2020.72 --> 2024.24
sources and yeah who says that they're

2022.64 --> 2027.039
willing to share that

2024.24 --> 2028.96
even you know do they even know what's

2027.039 --> 2030.64
going on or if they just retracted for

2028.96 --> 2031.76
like 10 years and they don't even have

2030.64 --> 2034.64
internet or something

2031.76 --> 2035.36
you don't know that so it would be kind

2034.64 --> 2037.279
of good

2035.36 --> 2039.6789999999999
if we could basically move this

2037.279 --> 2043.279
awareness line into

2039.679 --> 2047.3600000000001
owners of stores and food sources

2043.279 --> 2051.839
in less rural areas more city areas

2047.36 --> 2054.879
perhaps and then bypass

2051.839 --> 2058.32
the lockdown bypass

2054.879 --> 2059.04
the illegal fines how do we do this i

2058.32 --> 2061.28
don't know

2059.04 --> 2062.079
i'm not a judicial guy i'm just seeing

2061.28 --> 2066.159
this

2062.079 --> 2066.159
i'm i'm seeing it

2066.56 --> 2070.0789999999997
don't know what to do about it but i

2068.48 --> 2073.44
think there might be

2070.079 --> 2074.0
some room there for improvement in the

2073.44 --> 2076.839
type of

2074.0 --> 2079.119
actions we could perform other than

2076.839 --> 2081.44
protesting

2079.119 --> 2083.44
which doesn't really work anymore

2081.44 --> 2084.7200000000003
because in order for protests to

2083.44 --> 2087.04
actually work

2084.72 --> 2088.0
you would have to have the mainstream

2087.04 --> 2090.079
media on your

2088.0 --> 2091.44
side otherwise they're literally just

2090.079 --> 2093.44
going to snow it under

2091.44 --> 2095.04
they're just either going to ignore it

2093.44 --> 2096.159
they're going to take it out of context

2095.04 --> 2099.7599999999998
make it look smaller

2096.159 --> 2101.92
poo poo it and it just yeah

2099.76 --> 2104.96
people will still take notice of course

2101.92 --> 2106.96
through social media

2104.96 --> 2109.52
but it's not gonna have the effect it

2106.96 --> 2112.0
was originally intended for

2109.52 --> 2113.04
it'll only have a waking up effect not

2112.0 --> 2116.32
an actual

2113.04 --> 2120.0
political effect which what it was

2116.32 --> 2122.8
for originally see that function is gone

2120.0 --> 2123.68
it's gone it's never coming back until

2122.8 --> 2129.3590000000004
media

2123.68 --> 2129.359
is back in public control in control of

2130.04 --> 2137.52
non-politicized groups

2134.32 --> 2139.6800000000003
do you see that so

2137.52 --> 2140.72
yeah better to literally wake up

2139.68 --> 2144.0
individuals

2140.72 --> 2147.839
as many as you can and figure out how to

2144.0 --> 2150.72
get people like store owners into this

2147.839 --> 2152.64
as well and see what kind of legal

2150.72 --> 2153.9199999999996
issues they're dealing with versus the

2152.64 --> 2157.44
corona situation

2153.92 --> 2159.28
and figuring out how viable is it

2157.44 --> 2161.2000000000003
i don't know region to region country to

2159.28 --> 2163.599
country with basically

2161.2 --> 2164.64
ignoring the fines how does it work i

2163.599 --> 2167.6800000000003
don't know

2164.64 --> 2170.0789999999997
does anybody know how this can work

2167.68 --> 2172.0789999999997
because hey if it turns out that it's

2170.079 --> 2174.8
literally just a bluff

2172.079 --> 2175.2000000000003
which it should be otherwise they're

2174.8 --> 2178.6400000000003
gonna

2175.2 --> 2180.72
step over a big big boundary criminal

2178.64 --> 2183.2799999999997
boundary if if they're gonna

2180.72 --> 2184.839
physically enforce you pay that money or

2183.28 --> 2188.0
rob from you

2184.839 --> 2190.24
right so can we

2188.0 --> 2192.96
ignore the finds and literally keep

2190.24 --> 2196.0
everything open is that a possibility

2192.96 --> 2198.839
figure this out in your region

2196.0 --> 2200.0
figure this out and spread that

2198.839 --> 2203.2799999999997
knowledge

2200.0 --> 2204.32
get experts on this riley needs to look

2203.28 --> 2206.88
into this too i

2204.32 --> 2209.28
really want him to i hope he gets this

2206.88 --> 2209.28
message

2212.839 --> 2215.839
right

2216.06 --> 2218.7999999999997
[Music]

2217.28 --> 2220.88
no it doesn't start at the birth

2218.8 --> 2224.96
certificate on the birth certificate

2220.88 --> 2225.92
is not yeah your constitutional right as

2224.96 --> 2229.2
a person

2225.92 --> 2233.76
or not as a person as a

2229.2 --> 2236.64
man or woman on the land

2233.76 --> 2236.6400000000003
that is what it is

2236.8 --> 2240.32
the birth certificate does not

2238.48 --> 2243.68
automatically mean

2240.32 --> 2247.04
that you agree to

2243.68 --> 2247.04
pandemic measures

2248.24 --> 2255.2799999999997
that's not the case but

2251.44 --> 2256.96
yeah the yeah the the birth certificate

2255.28 --> 2259.28
is

2256.96 --> 2261.44
at the structural foundation of the

2259.28 --> 2271.8390000000004
judicial system that's correct it's a

2261.44 --> 2271.839
very complicated mess like that

2273.28 --> 2280.32
right oh caps is a straw man right

2277.44 --> 2283.119
well all caps does have judicial

2280.32 --> 2283.119
implications

2283.52 --> 2288.0
it's like technical language in in the

2286.4 --> 2291.04
judicial language

2288.0 --> 2294.32
it's very important to realize that if

2291.04 --> 2294.32
you're confronted with such

2296.839 --> 2299.839
texts

2308.78 --> 2313.8390000000004
[Music]

2310.839 --> 2313.839
so

2324.839 --> 2327.839
what

2335.2 --> 2343.04
right so anyway yeah

2339.52 --> 2345.92
a little point about that

2343.04 --> 2355.04
and yeah technically i would like to get

2345.92 --> 2357.2000000000003
back to flat earth again

2355.04 --> 2360.64
but i don't know maybe everyone's just

2357.2 --> 2360.64
too caught up into this now

2363.44 --> 2369.839
i'll just see what you guys are talking

2366.839 --> 2369.839
about

2372.24 --> 2378.64
corporate husbandry this is

2375.28 --> 2383.8390000000004
that's that's an interesting way to

2378.64 --> 2383.839
to put it again

2396.24 --> 2405.5989999999997
yeah i don't want to be protected

2401.2 --> 2409.2
from infection by external agencies

2405.599 --> 2409.2000000000003
it's none of their damn business

2409.359 --> 2414.319
i'll get infected with ever the whatever

2411.839 --> 2419.92
the [ __ ] i want

2414.319 --> 2419.92
by my own doing and i'll fix it again

2422.72 --> 2426.7999999999997
because i trust in my body and in my

2425.28 --> 2430.36
knowledge of metabolism

2426.8 --> 2431.599
and how it actually works

2430.36 --> 2435.119
[Music]

2431.599 --> 2436.839
i'm not afraid of no viruses i'm afraid

2435.119 --> 2439.6800000000003
of poison

2436.839 --> 2442.64
perhaps

2439.68 --> 2445.2
you know plenty of terrible things that

2442.64 --> 2448.48
can happen with poison

2445.2 --> 2451.2799999999997
but organisms

2448.48 --> 2451.599
not so afraid of it well parasites there

2451.28 --> 2453.76
are

2451.599 --> 2456.319
of course parasites but yet you can get

2453.76 --> 2456.3190000000004
rid of them

2458.56 --> 2465.359
but yeah beyond that

2462.24 --> 2467.9199999999996
not so much it's all giant

2465.359 --> 2469.5989999999997
yeah to me the body is a giant highway

2467.92 --> 2472.96
system

2469.599 --> 2476.079
like a county or a miniature country or

2472.96 --> 2479.44
i know big country and it's just a

2476.079 --> 2483.2000000000003
highway system of microorganisms

2479.44 --> 2487.119
and there's interaction all the time

2483.2 --> 2490.48
like if the idea of this

2487.119 --> 2492.4
bacterial infection you know because

2490.48 --> 2495.839
there are bacteria

2492.4 --> 2495.839
bacterial infections

2496.079 --> 2502.8
they don't like

2500.48 --> 2504.72
yes things can get infected with the

2502.8 --> 2508.48
presence of bacteria but it doesn't

2504.72 --> 2510.0789999999997
always just happen like that no

2508.48 --> 2512.56
and there's the skin that protects you

2510.079 --> 2514.0
like in an open wound yes

2512.56 --> 2515.839
and all kinds of things can get

2514.0 --> 2517.28
infectious in an open wound but that's

2515.839 --> 2520.839
because

2517.28 --> 2524.4
there's no bacteria to counter it

2520.839 --> 2526.24
right but with a virus

2524.4 --> 2527.92
i don't think that even does anything

2526.24 --> 2531.2
viruses are produced in the body and

2527.92 --> 2534.88
they're like at this mechanism

2531.2 --> 2538.7999999999997
people can have viruses in them without

2534.88 --> 2542.319
ever having been in contact with

2538.8 --> 2542.319
other people for years

2542.96 --> 2550.0
it's a mechanism it doesn't do anything

2546.96 --> 2553.04
it's not an infectious agent at all

2550.0 --> 2556.24
and bacteria aren't really

2553.04 --> 2558.72
either but they could be

2556.24 --> 2561.1189999999997
they could get in the wrong place and

2558.72 --> 2564.56
then create havoc

2561.119 --> 2565.599
you know but they're not like a species

2564.56 --> 2568.0789999999997
that is like

2565.599 --> 2569.6800000000003
trying to spread around and kill

2568.079 --> 2573.44
everything normally

2569.68 --> 2576.0
unless it has been i don't know

2573.44 --> 2579.839
weaponized and then even then it dies

2576.0 --> 2579.839
out it's an unnatural state

2584.96 --> 2588.0
yeah bacteria can be a little

2586.72 --> 2590.3999999999996
complicated

2588.0 --> 2593.839
virus isn't it i don't really see yeah i

2590.4 --> 2593.839
don't believe in that at all

2601.44 --> 2608.2400000000002
like viruses is just a no

2604.8 --> 2612.0
bacteria is like not really

2608.24 --> 2614.8799999999997
but good at occasion perhaps

2612.0 --> 2614.88
right conditions

2615.2 --> 2621.4399999999996
and then parasites yeah definitely

2618.88 --> 2623.2000000000003
parasites absolutely that is exactly

2621.44 --> 2626.56
what it is

2623.2 --> 2630.48
like malaria absolutely

2626.56 --> 2635.2799999999997
and other things other parasitical

2630.48 --> 2638.319
based diseases yes that is real

2635.28 --> 2640.1600000000003
fungi is in its own way kind of a

2638.319 --> 2643.2799999999997
parasite

2640.16 --> 2646.319
but look there's even fungi functions

2643.28 --> 2648.6400000000003
in the body to some degree it's because

2646.319 --> 2651.2799999999997
it's a giant what you got is a giant

2648.64 --> 2653.359
blend of all sorts of things

2651.28 --> 2654.5600000000004
and it's kept under control and it has

2653.359 --> 2658.4
its functions and

2654.56 --> 2658.4
i don't know what else it does it's so

2660.839 --> 2663.839
extensive

2669.2 --> 2672.24
right yeah that's that's the thing you

2671.2 --> 2675.68
know

2672.24 --> 2677.9199999999996
when some foreign unknown

2675.68 --> 2680.48
type of thing comes in there like a

2677.92 --> 2682.2400000000002
bacteria or a fungi that you've never

2680.48 --> 2683.839
seen before yeah could have a vivid

2682.24 --> 2686.9599999999996
reaction

2683.839 --> 2687.599
but the thing is i'm pretty sure the

2686.96 --> 2691.839
body

2687.599 --> 2695.92
collects samples

2691.839 --> 2699.44
because yeah it doesn't just

2695.92 --> 2703.04
oh there's a new fungi in town and i

2699.44 --> 2704.0
destroyed utterly erase every trace of

2703.04 --> 2707.2
it

2704.0 --> 2710.64
no i think that

2707.2 --> 2712.24
yeah basically the it's said that the

2710.64 --> 2714.48
memory is kept of it

2712.24 --> 2716.9599999999996
in what is it the white blood cells and

2714.48 --> 2719.92
all that in the system

2716.96 --> 2721.079
but isn't it just more likely that they

2719.92 --> 2724.079
just keep

2721.079 --> 2727.52
encapsulated

2724.079 --> 2729.6800000000003
samples around or even the thing kind of

2727.52 --> 2731.28
finds a proper function within the

2729.68 --> 2733.68
body's metabolism

2731.28 --> 2734.96
like it finds its place and then it's

2733.68 --> 2738.16
like kept

2734.96 --> 2738.16
under control there

2740.96 --> 2744.88
like that last description seems more

2744.0 --> 2747.839
likely

2744.88 --> 2747.839
to me

2750.24 --> 2755.04
and i think that maybe like certain

2752.96 --> 2758.0
types of viruses

2755.04 --> 2759.7599999999998
are actually that so they're not really

2758.0 --> 2761.76
the viruses the virus would be the side

2759.76 --> 2762.6400000000003
effect it's some other thing maybe a

2761.76 --> 2766.2400000000002
fungi

2762.64 --> 2766.24
maybe some misunderstood thing

2767.599 --> 2772.2400000000002
and it just takes its place until

2770.24 --> 2774.7999999999997
certain situations arrive and then it

2772.24 --> 2778.3999999999996
might suddenly play up

2774.8 --> 2778.4
right anyway

2778.72 --> 2781.7599999999998
enough about that

2781.92 --> 2786.839
i don't think there is any threat of a

2785.119 --> 2790.88
virus and to make

2786.839 --> 2794.24
laws for that

2790.88 --> 2797.839
is almost already redundant to me it's

2794.24 --> 2797.839
it's completely useless

2798.0 --> 2804.8
it's laws

2801.119 --> 2804.8
for fictional situations

2805.119 --> 2808.88
and if you know that then it's like

2806.96 --> 2811.52
completely useless

2808.88 --> 2812.319
and it is it is completely useless every

2811.52 --> 2815.7599999999998
measure

2812.319 --> 2817.359
thus far is completely useless now the

2815.76 --> 2820.3190000000004
single measure has been

2817.359 --> 2820.319
actually useful

2821.76 --> 2825.92
except maybe i don't know just standard

2824.4 --> 2829.28
treatments for

2825.92 --> 2831.6800000000003
like lung like what is it typical

2829.28 --> 2833.76
flu-like conditions

2831.68 --> 2836.24
and then the hydroxychloroquine and all

2833.76 --> 2838.6400000000003
these other variants

2836.24 --> 2839.68
yeah that people keep busy with trying

2838.64 --> 2842.16
to figure out

2839.68 --> 2843.2
what you could do and there's all kinds

2842.16 --> 2846.64
of things you could do

2843.2 --> 2851.2799999999997
about getting better when you're in

2846.64 --> 2855.359
such conditions where this

2851.28 --> 2857.44
virus element typically arrives

2855.359 --> 2859.2799999999997
it arrives in the body because the body

2857.44 --> 2861.92
makes it under these

2859.28 --> 2863.599
health conditions it's not the other way

2861.92 --> 2866.0
around it's not like oh that particle

2863.599 --> 2867.92
gets in the body and then you get that

2866.0 --> 2868.96
condition because that particle got in

2867.92 --> 2873.839
your body no no

2868.96 --> 2873.839
no no that's not how it works

2882.559 --> 2887.8390000000004
not with viruses anyway

2904.0 --> 2909.95
what sin causes sickness

2908.16 --> 2911.7599999999998
sure sure it will

2909.95 --> 2914.7999999999997
[Music]

2911.76 --> 2916.96
look it's very simple stress

2914.8 --> 2918.079
causes sickness it it's a pressure on

2916.96 --> 2920.4
the body

2918.079 --> 2923.599
it tends to change your metabolic and

2920.4 --> 2926.88
even hormonal systems

2923.599 --> 2928.88
stress causes sickness well sin

2926.88 --> 2931.28
you better believe that sin causes

2928.88 --> 2931.28
stress

2932.8 --> 2939.44
all right so yeah that's logical

2937.17 --> 2943.839
[Music]

2939.44 --> 2943.839
it will definitely influence it

2945.28 --> 2957.8390000000004
low ordinary bear

2976.88 --> 2980.559
yeah that's interesting missouri bear

2982.319 --> 2986.72
yeah maybe it is because all this

2984.4 --> 2990.44
cleanliness

2986.72 --> 2995.2
actually caused a lot of chemicals

2990.44 --> 2999.28
disinfectant chemicals to spread around

2995.2 --> 3002.16
and become like a secondary toxin toxin

2999.28 --> 3003.2000000000003
that people are like breathing in

3002.16 --> 3006.24
getting in through

3003.2 --> 3008.72
everything everything that's been also

3006.24 --> 3011.4399999999996
sterilized supposedly right while

3008.72 --> 3013.04
sterilization is based on the idea of an

3011.44 --> 3014.7200000000003
infections agent

3013.04 --> 3016.4
being neutralized and that solves the

3014.72 --> 3018.7999999999997
problem supposedly

3016.4 --> 3021.52
it doesn't take into account that yeah

3018.8 --> 3022.319
all that stuff everywhere is also toxic

3021.52 --> 3025.359
it's just

3022.319 --> 3028.48
not good for the body either and

3025.359 --> 3029.359
especially if you get constantly doused

3028.48 --> 3032.48
in things like

3029.359 --> 3035.359
alcohol squish squirting on your hands

3032.48 --> 3036.16
it's going to literally attack the biome

3035.359 --> 3038.96
on your body

3036.16 --> 3040.48
which you need for your health you need

3038.96 --> 3043.68
it on your skin

3040.48 --> 3046.2
and you need it in your guts and

3043.68 --> 3047.5989999999997
yeah the more you get exposed to

3046.2 --> 3050.319
disinfectants

3047.599 --> 3051.44
the worse things get and the worse the

3050.319 --> 3054.16
body response

3051.44 --> 3054.64
gets because your biome is under attack

3054.16 --> 3069.839
from that

3054.64 --> 3069.839
from poison

3080.839 --> 3083.839
so

3095.28 --> 3099.92
all right now for example you know it's

3097.92 --> 3102.0
just all these

3099.92 --> 3105.119
all these products there are meant to

3102.0 --> 3107.359
clean things and

3105.119 --> 3109.28
that you do use for shower and bathing

3107.359 --> 3111.2799999999997
and all that you know

3109.28 --> 3113.599
you don't really need that all of the

3111.28 --> 3117.0400000000004
time at all

3113.599 --> 3121.599
it's actually bad for you you know

3117.04 --> 3123.2799999999997
for me it's okay you need soap

3121.599 --> 3126.4
when you're going to deal with some

3123.28 --> 3130.7200000000003
specific fat situation that you

3126.4 --> 3133.28
want to get rid of right

3130.72 --> 3134.24
so i'm very specific at that like okay

3133.28 --> 3136.4
there's going to be fat

3134.24 --> 3139.4399999999996
i'm not going to get it away or oil or

3136.4 --> 3142.079
whatever i'm not gonna get it away

3139.44 --> 3143.68
with just water so then i'm definitely

3142.079 --> 3147.44
gonna need soap

3143.68 --> 3149.359
some kind no and like yeah

3147.44 --> 3151.28
washing your hair is very nice but at

3149.359 --> 3152.88
some point you're gonna have to use some

3151.28 --> 3156.1600000000003
kind of shampoo

3152.88 --> 3159.599
because of obvious reasons but

3156.16 --> 3161.68
bar those situations

3159.599 --> 3164.48
i try to avoid it as much as possible i

3161.68 --> 3167.52
even avoid it with dishes

3164.48 --> 3170.72
with my food plates i make sure they're

3167.52 --> 3172.8
clean enough but i i pretty much only

3170.72 --> 3176.7999999999997
use water

3172.8 --> 3180.0
unless it's like a really oily situation

3176.8 --> 3183.3590000000004
of course and then yeah well i still try

3180.0 --> 3184.4
to avoid using soap just try to avoid it

3183.359 --> 3188.4
as much as i can

3184.4 --> 3188.4
using the dishes and it works great

3189.52 --> 3192.88
yeah although yeah you know when you

3192.079 --> 3196.0
fatty pan

3192.88 --> 3197.52
then usually fat does tend to somewhat

3196.0 --> 3199.28
stay behind

3197.52 --> 3201.2
and it did yeah you still have yeah you

3199.28 --> 3203.2000000000003
can't just let it all be dirty all the

3201.2 --> 3206.24
time of course that's not gonna be

3203.2 --> 3206.7999999999997
healthy either you know fattiness also

3206.24 --> 3210.72
collects

3206.8 --> 3212.88
just junk from the air dust and

3210.72 --> 3214.24
whatever remnants are floating around so

3212.88 --> 3216.319
that's not

3214.24 --> 3217.2799999999997
something you should be collecting

3216.319 --> 3219.7599999999998
either

3217.28 --> 3221.44
so yeah find a good balance with it just

3219.76 --> 3224.7200000000003
that's why i say don't

3221.44 --> 3228.079
for you so no no no

3224.72 --> 3231.2799999999997
no but try to use it as

3228.079 --> 3234.4
with a minute as minimum as you can just

3231.28 --> 3234.4
minimize the use

3235.2 --> 3238.319
because hey a lot of fats you actually

3237.68 --> 3240.5589999999997
need

3238.319 --> 3240.5589999999997
them

3244.079 --> 3248.079
and this is a known effect for example

3247.119 --> 3251.2000000000003
people that over

3248.079 --> 3253.599
shower and over soap themselves up

3251.2 --> 3255.68
they simply get a giant body response

3253.599 --> 3259.839
that the body starts to grease up

3255.68 --> 3262.0
every single time because it's used to

3259.839 --> 3264.0
all that fat being taken away hey guess

3262.0 --> 3267.04
what your skin actually needs some

3264.0 --> 3269.04
fat right so

3267.04 --> 3271.2
your body is going to try to

3269.04 --> 3274.079
overcompensate that terrible habit

3271.2 --> 3275.839
by constantly pumping out grease to

3274.079 --> 3279.28
desperately keep the skin

3275.839 --> 3281.359
fat enough not to yeah get brittle and

3279.28 --> 3285.44
all that

3281.359 --> 3288.64
so yeah that's why i say just

3285.44 --> 3289.92
only use it when you really need it try

3288.64 --> 3293.2
to keep it

3289.92 --> 3296.88
to a minimum that's my advice

3293.2 --> 3297.5989999999997
i still stay very clean and i feel very

3296.88 --> 3300.559
healthy and

3297.599 --> 3303.839
yeah i think that my skin overall for a

3300.559 --> 3303.8390000000004
40 year old is great

3305.359 --> 3308.48
i used to have a lot more like issues

3307.68 --> 3310.96
remember

3308.48 --> 3313.2
like yeah but that's also like

3310.96 --> 3315.28
psychological backlash situations which

3313.2 --> 3317.52
i had to explain

3315.28 --> 3318.48
overall i'm not wrinkling up i'm not

3317.52 --> 3321.68
like

3318.48 --> 3323.839
visibly growing older i'm not losing

3321.68 --> 3326.96
giant amounts of hair

3323.839 --> 3329.839
although yeah it's not perfect anymore

3326.96 --> 3330.319
like it was say 20 years ago but it's

3329.839 --> 3332.319
it's

3330.319 --> 3334.319
that well good enough for me for

3332.319 --> 3336.24
somebody that's 40 you know

3334.319 --> 3337.7599999999998
a lot of guys out there kind of jealous

3336.24 --> 3341.2799999999997
so yay

3337.76 --> 3349.8390000000004
goody my ego got something

3341.28 --> 3349.8390000000004
to hold on to goody

3352.72 --> 3359.2
tiny one well perfumes are just garbage

3356.24 --> 3363.839
i don't yeah definitely avoid that at

3359.2 --> 3363.839
all cost

3366.48 --> 3370.16
or agm or stress contributes to how your

3368.799 --> 3372.88
skin looks or stress

3370.16 --> 3373.44
continuous unresolved stress does aid

3372.88 --> 3376.48
you

3373.44 --> 3381.04
this is a fact but

3376.48 --> 3385.76
for me the why i had skin issues is just

3381.04 --> 3388.24
it's like getting rid of poison

3385.76 --> 3389.6800000000003
like continual stress that they actually

3388.24 --> 3393.4399999999996
resolved

3389.68 --> 3396.16
if i would have gotten stuck into that

3393.44 --> 3398.48
like into a permanent stock situation

3396.16 --> 3400.96
then i might have eventually grown old

3398.48 --> 3403.68
all of a sudden like gollum or

3400.96 --> 3404.0
like bilbo after he dropped the ring i

3403.68 --> 3406.64
think

3404.0 --> 3408.799
after he gave it away i who knows but

3406.64 --> 3413.04
because i didn't because i did

3408.799 --> 3413.04
literally crawl out of it like really

3414.319 --> 3418.319
then you get like inflammation

3416.4 --> 3420.88
situations it's like

3418.319 --> 3423.2799999999997
it's like this battle is uncertainly

3420.88 --> 3426.319
going on inside here

3423.28 --> 3430.4
and that shows and it hurts like that

3426.319 --> 3432.54
hurts it's freaky i'm glad it's

3430.4 --> 3435.59
gone poof i'm glad of that

3432.54 --> 3435.59
[Music]

3435.599 --> 3443.119
so yeah i'm great and

3439.599 --> 3446.7200000000003
i don't shower that often and i rarely

3443.119 --> 3449.839
rarely use soap i only use soap

3446.72 --> 3451.04
once a day every day when i wash my feet

3449.839 --> 3453.839
because that is

3451.04 --> 3455.2
part of my hygiene routine washing my

3453.839 --> 3458.839
feet that's what i do

3455.2 --> 3462.24
works really great on me

3458.839 --> 3465.04
so it keeps me healthy

3462.24 --> 3466.24
minimizes just the amount of waste that

3465.04 --> 3468.4
i need to replace

3466.24 --> 3470.5589999999997
yeah the amount of fats and all that

3468.4 --> 3473.76
fats also containing minerals

3470.559 --> 3475.599
i don't need to eat more to replace

3473.76 --> 3477.2000000000003
everything that i'm losing on a daily

3475.599 --> 3481.119
basis

3477.2 --> 3481.5989999999997
and i'm doing great and i don't need to

3481.119 --> 3485.44
fear

3481.599 --> 3488.079
infection because i know that

3485.44 --> 3489.52
it's not really like that at all just

3488.079 --> 3493.04
don't get

3489.52 --> 3493.04
dirt in an open wound

3493.359 --> 3497.2
or well just junk in an open wound or

3496.4 --> 3500.1600000000003
something

3497.2 --> 3501.2
