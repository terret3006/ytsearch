yeah good to see you all and this

219.28 --> 233.739
Tuesday at the 10th of March 2020 so

228.609 --> 235.65900000000002
yesterday for me it was very late and I

233.739 --> 239.669
think I stayed up until it's like 6:00

235.659 --> 242.849
pretty crazy but yeah it's all good I

239.669 --> 248.62
still feel fine

242.849 --> 251.909
much better than two days ago and yeah I

248.62 --> 258.07
kind of had to stay up especially for

251.909 --> 261.699
for Oh Benjamin second stream yeah

258.07 --> 266.32
because he was with he pulled out a what

261.699 --> 269.65000000000003
is it a signed book from from Bill Nye

266.32 --> 272.11
science guy and he proceeded to do a

269.65 --> 274.57
book burning with that and man like

272.11 --> 277.63
every piece you read of it it was just

274.57 --> 281.74
terrible like that the whole book it was

277.63 --> 286.99
terrible it was terribly written and it

281.74 --> 289.03000000000003
was just annoying and stupid so that was

286.99 --> 291.37
kind of fun to sit with through and the

289.03 --> 294.96999999999997
other one earlier in the evening was

291.37 --> 302.53000000000003
also very good so I did catch both of

294.97 --> 309.24
those dreams see oh yeah was again hung

302.53 --> 311.919
around the 24/7 discord flatter stream

309.24 --> 314.32
several times I must have spent like

311.919 --> 316.479
over three or four hours in total

314.32 --> 318.039
they're just going they're going away

316.479 --> 322.87899999999996
again coming back

318.039 --> 328.599
going away again coming back but yeah

322.879 --> 328.59900000000005
I've been very busy yesterday online and

330.309 --> 339.09900000000005
I think I also watch a movie on Netflix

335.709 --> 339.099
was it again

343.57 --> 347.58
oh yeah oh wait I didn't finish that

353.57 --> 364.07
yeah I'll get back to that so lots of

361.89 --> 368.61
videos have been coming out basically

364.07 --> 372.42
videos and visual memes concerning the

368.61 --> 376.67
latest ridiculous baller remarks because

372.42 --> 376.67
yeah that just seems to be the thing now

377.78 --> 386.76
like all the go-go I've even talked to

381.75 --> 389.88
chocolate about it it's like it's like a

386.76 --> 393.65999999999997
gold rush but instead of harvesting gold

389.88 --> 396.96
in the ground we're harvesting golden

393.66 --> 400.08000000000004
moments and we get it from baller idiots

396.96 --> 400.97999999999996
that just spiral out of control with

400.08 --> 403.56
their doublespeak

400.98 --> 406.14000000000004
until they basically concede in plain

403.56 --> 408.78000000000003
sight and in the most ridiculous ways

406.14 --> 413.31
and that's really what's been happening

408.78 --> 417.22999999999996
a lot in the last few months and it

413.31 --> 422.27
seems to be increasing salt harvesting

417.23 --> 422.27000000000004
okay if you want to call it that

424.89 --> 429.69
hey what's that link deck

434.31 --> 439.8
oh hey its tenth man tenth man dishes

438.75 --> 452.76
huh

439.8 --> 458.09000000000003
whoa damn he's been busy huh hey

452.76 --> 458.09
interesting who is using a good type of

459.32 --> 472.14
kitchenware that's interesting

461.78 --> 475.169
now Teflon nonsense good stuff I guess

472.14 --> 477.919
I'm gonna subscribe to as well just

475.169 --> 477.919
check it out

482.1 --> 487.95000000000005
yeah so 10th man apparently started this

484.68 --> 490.41
a cooking flat earth and cooking type of

487.95 --> 493.43
channel and that's kind of fun

490.41 --> 493.43
we'll see

506.37 --> 516.65
if you could only sell baller salt for

509.49 --> 516.65
real money right

523.49 --> 529.67
why yeah I don't think it works as a

526.61 --> 531.08
currency like that it's more it's like

529.67 --> 535.25
harvesting energy

531.08 --> 540.6500000000001
it just happens and you can take that

535.25 --> 548.66
and spread it around and just have our

540.65 --> 551.09
site flourish on it rather hmm yeah Tom

548.66 --> 553.2199999999999
Parker agreed pink Himalayan salt is

551.09 --> 555.6700000000001
really good I've been using that for a

553.22 --> 555.6700000000001
long time

555.7 --> 561.94
hey Mandy you Scott west

570.38 --> 576.95
hmm you have library coin good servant

573.74 --> 582.76
that you follow red pill philosophies

576.95 --> 586.7
advice and make an account with lb err I

582.76 --> 592.04
heard they give out free library coin

586.7 --> 595.48
when you join up I may do that myself

592.04 --> 595.48
sometime somewhere

607.86 --> 610.73
hmm

628.45 --> 633.59
now I've been thinking in general I'd

631.49 --> 637.52
always do that I'm thinking in general

633.59 --> 640.3100000000001
like where's this all going considering

637.52 --> 644.59
the Flat Earth developments because it

640.31 --> 648.1999999999999
seems like it just it seems like we're

644.59 --> 650.9
well we're technically argumentatively

648.2 --> 653.69
in a winning position very much so for

650.9 --> 656.63
blatantly so at the same time it seems

653.69 --> 658.1300000000001
like the baller side and the entire

656.63 --> 665.83
machine behind it

658.13 --> 669.05
is kind of just amping up the stupidity

665.83 --> 670.97
lowering the bar so that it kind of

669.05 --> 674.3599999999999
doesn't matter anymore that's what I

670.97 --> 677.57
feel so they're they're aiming more now

674.36 --> 681.11
for the even dumber people that are much

677.57 --> 683.36
more unlikely to actually get through it

681.11 --> 686.14
get through the conditioning and figure

683.36 --> 689.09
out that the earth is indeed flat and

686.14 --> 693.35
just focus on that peer pressure peer

689.09 --> 695.9300000000001
pressure for the lower tier people yeah

693.35 --> 698.5400000000001
lowering the bar indeed but it is a

695.93 --> 702.29
strategy it is a strategy of figuring

698.54 --> 706.79
out we cannot maintain the illusion

702.29 --> 708.41
control up to that level anymore except

706.79 --> 712.76
for those that are on that level that

708.41 --> 716.8399999999999
simply choose to join us you know that

712.76 --> 719.6
that choose to keep on doing it being

716.84 --> 723.44
with the ball fordable all that despite

719.6 --> 724.91
knowing that it's flat because of you

723.44 --> 728.7800000000001
could say political reasons or whatever

724.91 --> 730.67
of ideological doesn't really matter so

728.78 --> 734.0899999999999
they then lower the bar and make

730.67 --> 735.86
everything dumber that they do on the

734.09 --> 739.34
web it's not just a couple of you know

735.86 --> 743.71
that the entire narrative and the output

739.34 --> 748.07
and all the shows all become even dumber

743.71 --> 750.74
although do they do they even get dumber

748.07 --> 752.9300000000001
or were they always that dumb and we're

750.74 --> 755.78
just now figuring out how dumb that is

752.93 --> 757.51
I'm not entirely sure because really

755.78 --> 762.5889999999999
when you look back

757.51 --> 764.75
or when I look back at older stuff that

762.589 --> 769.22
I watched in a time when I was still

764.75 --> 772.37
very much asleep and dreaming well that

769.22 --> 774.1700000000001
stuff it did sometimes give me like a

772.37 --> 776.51
weird feeling like I don't know why

774.17 --> 778.3389999999999
there are they trying to address the

776.51 --> 782.0
children or something that they kind of

778.339 --> 783.5290000000001
talk down to you so I didn't I did I saw

782.0 --> 786.35
something but I didn't really notice

783.529 --> 792.079
like what that was because I didn't know

786.35 --> 793.7
it was all [ __ ] so sometimes I

792.079 --> 796.6099999999999
wonder like are they really dumbing it

793.7 --> 799.9100000000001
down or is it just are they really just

796.61 --> 807.0500000000001
going for quantity now for quantity of

799.91 --> 809.42
the same level of output oh yeah yeah

807.05 --> 811.9699999999999
I'll remind you I have a youtube show

809.42 --> 814.0999999999999
and I'm very active on the Internet

811.97 --> 817.5790000000001
pretty much would spend all my time

814.1 --> 821.839
there and I ask for donations for my

817.579 --> 824.329
activity because I can't really get

821.839 --> 827.3900000000001
around on social welfare alone and a

824.329 --> 829.37
couple of side jobs that I do have but

827.39 --> 833.829
yeah maybe one day I'll be able to

829.37 --> 833.829
ascend out of that financially and

834.82 --> 840.95
become more self-sufficient and who

837.38 --> 843.11
knows maybe at some point yeah I won't

840.95 --> 848.24
have room for this because there would

843.11 --> 851.54
be another way out of the financial

848.24 --> 853.339
situation and then yeah yeah but I know

851.54 --> 855.98
that's why you guys always bring that

853.339 --> 858.0790000000001
it's always the same trolls and ballers

855.98 --> 859.61
and people that just don't like me that

858.079 --> 862.06
bring it up because they know they know

859.61 --> 865.88
yeah are we know who's a social welfare

862.06 --> 868.3389999999999
user let's emphasize how much of a

865.88 --> 870.35
detriment he is financially to the world

868.339 --> 873.7900000000001
to try and make him feel as guilty as

870.35 --> 877.399
possible because maybe then maybe then

873.79 --> 880.1899999999999
we can peer pressure him to step away

877.399 --> 882.589
because that's the only real way to yeah

880.19 --> 885.44
to get out of that financial situation

882.589 --> 887.6600000000001
is to basically dive into the system

885.44 --> 889.9100000000001
become entangled so you really can't get

887.66 --> 891.36
out anymore and then you can say oh I am

889.91 --> 893.3389999999999
sort of financially

891.36 --> 895.26
sufficient up until the moment that

893.339 --> 900.589
suddenly I get robbed by the government

895.26 --> 910.769
by the politicians then yeah oops

900.589 --> 914.399
you know so yeah I'm a youtuber I I get

910.769 --> 917.79
income from Google officially it's

914.399 --> 919.89
detracted from my social welfare so the

917.79 --> 922.019
be way I really get around other than

919.89 --> 926.06
social welfare which simply is not

922.019 --> 928.26
sufficient to get around it isn't

926.06 --> 931.0189999999999
probably wouldn't even be even if I

928.26 --> 937.41
completely quit on smoking cannabis and

931.019 --> 939.39
all that it probably still wouldn't yeah

937.41 --> 943.829
yeah lovely isn't it

939.39 --> 947.54
you see you see mr. trolley boy it's not

943.829 --> 953.2199999999999
excuses I just threw out the exact

947.54 --> 957.199
blatant raw truth about my situation cuz

953.22 --> 960.63
I'm not a gamma little [ __ ] like you

957.199 --> 964.92
who spends all this time twirling around

960.63 --> 966.529
things holding up this kind of image to

964.92 --> 969.029
protect who you really are

966.529 --> 973.079
what's really going around the decisions

969.029 --> 976.5889999999999
you've made yeah try to make all that

973.079 --> 978.6899999999999
that that noise that that frequency that

976.589 --> 981.0600000000001
brings you closer to what you're trying

978.69 --> 985.4590000000001
to hide from yourself to make that stop

981.06 --> 985.459
I know that's why you do that

989.01 --> 995.17
now Ian Adams I do what I want and but

992.529 --> 997.0
I'm also gonna address them because

995.17 --> 999.61
these freaks keep coming back and

997.0 --> 1000.51
banning them doesn't help I'll just do

999.61 --> 1006.269
something else

1000.51 --> 1009.66
they're always there watching so every

1006.269 --> 1014.88
time somebody does that I am gonna Ram

1009.66 --> 1018.4399999999999
the raw self exposing truth right in

1014.88 --> 1022.74
their face and they could never do that

1018.44 --> 1027.329
they could never do that and that is

1022.74 --> 1036.77
what I do it's really the only weapon I

1027.329 --> 1036.77
have against it the truth the raw truth

1040.65 --> 1050.049
so yeah that's why I do that Wow

1047.47 --> 1051.4
well if you dude if you don't even know

1050.049 --> 1052.96
the difference between a bow and a

1051.4 --> 1061.7800000000002
crossbow I don't even know what you're

1052.96 --> 1063.82
doing here man it's just dumb thank you

1061.78 --> 1066.49
for the two-pound superjet donation by

1063.82 --> 1071.01
the way Gideon sick work play ball just

1066.49 --> 1071.01
turn me loose okay

1076.12 --> 1083.6899999999998
right yeah bait 60 RMC that's the other

1079.43 --> 1085.73
part you know this this concept is

1083.69 --> 1089.1200000000001
original concept of like yeah you have

1085.73 --> 1092.33
to work for everyone so you put down

1089.12 --> 1094.4899999999998
your parts you're not a burden so it's

1092.33 --> 1098.4499999999998
to society well that's really a sensible

1094.49 --> 1102.77
angle from a base standpoint but the

1098.45 --> 1107.96
thing is grab lers have taken that

1102.77 --> 1112.01
concept and then applied it to the

1107.96 --> 1114.8
social hierarchy setup of society and

1112.01 --> 1120.41
especially the financial part of it in

1114.8 --> 1123.26
such a way that once you kind of come up

1120.41 --> 1124.88
from the bottom or I don't know figure

1123.26 --> 1128.72
out how things work then suddenly that

1124.88 --> 1130.64
all turns around and it's no longer yeah

1128.72 --> 1132.77
I make money see I don't have social

1130.64 --> 1136.25
welfare that means that I'm contributing

1132.77 --> 1139.36
to society overlooking that yeah some of

1136.25 --> 1142.58
them may have figured out this easy

1139.36 --> 1145.81
couple of tickets like oh yeah you get

1142.58 --> 1148.6999999999998
extra subsidies for that for that for

1145.81 --> 1152.72
that you just got to do a couple of

1148.7 --> 1157.5800000000002
things for that and yeah so they end up

1152.72 --> 1160.7
basically being a detriment to society

1157.58 --> 1163.84
not by taking social welfare but by

1160.7 --> 1167.27
taking money forcing them basically to

1163.84 --> 1172.1299999999999
act in a certain way that they might not

1167.27 --> 1174.56
even realize is very bad for everyone so

1172.13 --> 1178.8200000000002
you kind of take sheíll money for the

1174.56 --> 1180.1699999999998
devil effectively a lot of them do and

1178.82 --> 1181.82
they're not ashamed of it because

1180.17 --> 1184.64
everybody does it's the normal thing

1181.82 --> 1188.72
right but my god somebody on social

1184.64 --> 1190.64
welfare you know who that's you can't do

1188.72 --> 1193.55
that but you can definitely take money

1190.64 --> 1195.49
from very rich people that got rich from

1193.55 --> 1197.54
stealing it from everyone that

1195.49 --> 1200.78
manipulates you into doing something

1197.54 --> 1203.44
that's not good for everyone but you'll

1200.78 --> 1206.0
still feel good about taking that money

1203.44 --> 1208.97
which is probably more than the Social

1206.0 --> 1219.919
Welfare money isn't that ironic

1208.97 --> 1222.559
isn't that just damn ironic well term

1219.919 --> 1225.5900000000001
Cornwall where do you apply for show

1222.559 --> 1228.44
money well just I don't know get jobs

1225.59 --> 1231.019
find the right people and suddenly you

1228.44 --> 1233.299
might just get this contract opportunity

1231.019 --> 1236.389
this conditional contract and say yeah

1233.299 --> 1239.059
you can get the the big prize you get

1236.389 --> 1239.6899999999998
the big promotion and you'll be part of

1239.059 --> 1242.57
the club

1239.69 --> 1249.049
just a couple of things that are part of

1242.57 --> 1251.33
that you know and that way yeah a lot of

1249.049 --> 1253.07
people they have working lives and then

1251.33 --> 1255.6789999999999
they kind of roll into things without

1253.07 --> 1257.4189999999999
anyone ever noticing except that oh wow

1255.679 --> 1259.909
they're doing great they're having all

1257.419 --> 1262.46
this money hmm they don't really think

1259.909 --> 1268.0590000000002
about it too well but yeah that's

1262.46 --> 1268.059
happens a lot these days

1274.3 --> 1280.97
[Music]

1283.0 --> 1291.69
well Ian Adams you did that's uh that's

1289.0 --> 1291.69
not sorry

1297.2 --> 1304.06
huh oh that's very funny why don't you

1301.55 --> 1310.76
practice your buddy

1304.06 --> 1312.59
haha so funny yeah cuz NASA just just

1310.76 --> 1314.87
gives money just like that's not

1312.59 --> 1316.76
conditional at all right it wouldn't be

1314.87 --> 1318.1399999999999
tied into hey maybe you need to stop

1316.76 --> 1321.85
talking about Flat Earth Hey

1318.14 --> 1325.49
huh huh huh you [ __ ] [ __ ]

1321.85 --> 1326.9199999999998
you stupid troll [ __ ] get out of

1325.49 --> 1330.26
here

1326.92 --> 1333.38
piss off man you're that even a worthy

1330.26 --> 1337.48
troll you just another got their

1333.38 --> 1337.48
dwelling [ __ ] get out here

1355.16 --> 1361.68
yeah I don't like actually banning them

1358.58 --> 1362.51
you know that's why I don't do it

1361.68 --> 1365.69
outright

1362.51 --> 1368.67
you know I hope every time usually that

1365.69 --> 1371.01
once I address them with the raw truth

1368.67 --> 1373.41
they'll be sort of pacified and actually

1371.01 --> 1377.43
stop doing their [ __ ] break out of that

1373.41 --> 1379.41
spell out of that politicized energy way

1377.43 --> 1384.42
of conducting yourself towards somebody

1379.41 --> 1386.97
else but in a way even as they're then

1384.42 --> 1391.49
gonna joke for seed they usually end up

1386.97 --> 1394.73
still still just ignoring everything and

1391.49 --> 1394.73
keeping it up

1401.11 --> 1408.7299999999998
whoa Ian Adams that's is that a lot

1404.92 --> 1412.0900000000001
that's that's not bad that amount you

1408.73 --> 1415.8700000000001
walked away from it okay but you walked

1412.09 --> 1418.51
away from it because of what because I

1415.87 --> 1420.81
look in the past I have tried some jobs

1418.51 --> 1423.16
now those jobs were kind of shitty jobs

1420.81 --> 1425.44
because I didn't really have a proper

1423.16 --> 1429.5500000000002
education I was confused I was

1425.44 --> 1431.53
emotionally hurt and not very socially

1429.55 --> 1433.45
effective because of it so I was just

1431.53 --> 1438.36
fooling around a lot didn't really do my

1433.45 --> 1438.3600000000001
best didn't like the jobs at all and

1438.78 --> 1443.74
eventually it would be the social

1442.06 --> 1447.8799999999999
situation that would just stress me out

1443.74 --> 1450.85
because I've changing moods and other

1447.88 --> 1457.21
people would simply not understand not

1450.85 --> 1461.1399999999999
accept it so took yeah the two kind of

1457.21 --> 1463.51
ways yeah jobs kind of broke for me and

1461.14 --> 1466.3000000000002
most of them were basically temp based

1463.51 --> 1469.15
you know I never even really tried a

1466.3 --> 1472.3799999999999
real contract for like half a year I

1469.15 --> 1475.3000000000002
haven't ever gotten to that point even

1472.38 --> 1478.21
but every time it would be either I

1475.3 --> 1480.1299999999999
would it would just end because I got

1478.21 --> 1482.8600000000001
really sick of it and then got pissed

1480.13 --> 1487.18
off and then could looked in a negative

1482.86 --> 1489.34
way towards the wrong person or I would

1487.18 --> 1493.48
become I don't know really depressed

1489.34 --> 1495.31
demoralized about I don't know feeling

1493.48 --> 1496.99
like I'm stuck that kind of [ __ ] and

1495.31 --> 1499.57
then they would say yeah you're not

1496.99 --> 1502.96
being effective you're fired

1499.57 --> 1505.8999999999999
you know you're just you're just a

1502.96 --> 1507.49
bummer and you're not doing a lot that

1505.9 --> 1511.3600000000001
kind of [ __ ] so that would that's

1507.49 --> 1513.58
typically what happened in my team days

1511.36 --> 1517.12
when I really did kind of try jobs

1513.58 --> 1520.96
although not a lot because I just really

1517.12 --> 1524.8899999999999
freaking hated it I hated how dumb

1520.96 --> 1527.77
everything was just bored myself to

1524.89 --> 1532.0600000000002
death I would literally just figure out

1527.77 --> 1532.57
these neurotic perfected routines to

1532.06 --> 1536.5
make

1532.57 --> 1538.99
very dumb basic things insanely

1536.5 --> 1542.049
efficient because I was freaking bored

1538.99 --> 1544.44
to death by it all that's really what

1542.049 --> 1544.44
happened

1561.97 --> 1569.8500000000001
no I don't sell anything I've thought

1565.899 --> 1573.1589999999999
about it but yeah I wouldn't really know

1569.85 --> 1577.7199999999998
look the thing is I have this really

1573.159 --> 1579.519
neurotic thing which been pretty much

1577.72 --> 1582.519
nothing but a detriment to me at that

1579.519 --> 1585.159
and have to admit where it's like this

1582.519 --> 1593.23
artists pride when I put something out

1585.159 --> 1596.5900000000001
there like whenever put a product out

1593.23 --> 1599.379
there you know and you sell it you can't

1596.59 --> 1602.08
really change it afterward you know a

1599.379 --> 1604.36
web page you can update the way you

1602.08 --> 1606.6689999999999
explain things you can update as long as

1604.36 --> 1608.86
you keep on going a product if you put

1606.669 --> 1611.23
something on it and you sell it yeah it

1608.86 --> 1615.4289999999999
may be good enough and then afterwards

1611.23 --> 1617.59
you're like [ __ ] that was just stupid or

1615.429 --> 1620.98
it was primitive and you can't really

1617.59 --> 1628.1789999999999
change it anymore but no chats frozen

1620.98 --> 1631.75
again thanks for the notice anyway it's

1628.179 --> 1634.419
a it's a personal issue and that's why

1631.75 --> 1637.029
there is no our winni install oppose

1634.419 --> 1640.3890000000001
clothing and merchandise store yet with

1637.029 --> 1645.73
everything because if i did not have

1640.389 --> 1647.59
that stupid objective obstacle objection

1645.73 --> 1650.71
obstacle in my mind I would have

1647.59 --> 1652.48
probably already done that and the

1650.71 --> 1659.8890000000001
situation would be different very

1652.48 --> 1662.2
different but again I you have to

1659.889 --> 1665.2299999999998
realize just the entire approach of me

1662.2 --> 1668.0800000000002
in this situation I mean when I entered

1665.23 --> 1670.8990000000001
it I almost entered the flatter scene

1668.08 --> 1673.4499999999998
because I literally could not help

1670.899 --> 1676.9289999999999
myself it was almost like I have to risk

1673.45 --> 1682.6000000000001
death to do this I cannot stop it I

1676.929 --> 1684.8200000000002
cannot stop it was not stoppable like if

1682.6 --> 1687.57
I hadn't engaged the level of depression

1684.82 --> 1689.6
I would have come out of it might just

1687.57 --> 1692.119
killed me

1689.6 --> 1694.519
had to do it once it really had I had no

1692.119 --> 1697.1899999999998
choice but that doesn't mean that I had

1694.519 --> 1704.179
a real business plan or anything no I

1697.19 --> 1707.96
was terrified and it's really now after

1704.179 --> 1710.8090000000002
just years and getting around getting

1707.96 --> 1714.769
known getting or people getting somewhat

1710.809 --> 1717.559
familiar with me and what I do I've just

1714.769 --> 1723.349
slowly slowly slowly come to realize

1717.559 --> 1726.529
like wait things are just not as they

1723.349 --> 1731.119
felt they are not and I've been full of

1726.529 --> 1734.029
just illusions from my past things that

1731.119 --> 1737.059
drove me nuts and I've been trying to

1734.029 --> 1742.549
escape from that [ __ ] my entire life

1737.059 --> 1745.749
and now I feel like again I have this

1742.549 --> 1748.97
choice in front of me like yeah you can

1745.749 --> 1751.239
you can't escape that it is possible

1748.97 --> 1754.759
it's just never gonna be easy

1751.239 --> 1757.1290000000001
you got to figure out really like who is

1754.759 --> 1760.429
are when who am I here where is this

1757.129 --> 1765.109
going where is this really going really

1760.429 --> 1766.19
going not just next day or that and I

1765.109 --> 1772.82
gotta get it right again

1766.19 --> 1775.039
I gotta expand the oversight as to what

1772.82 --> 1777.289
I'm doing here what I'm gonna do beyond

1775.039 --> 1779.269
just oh nice I'm joining hangout I'm

1777.289 --> 1782.299
gonna talk about concepts I'm gonna put

1779.269 --> 1784.369
out suggestions for scientific

1782.299 --> 1786.979
experiments to figure certain things out

1784.369 --> 1789.379
like the nature of moonlight the

1786.979 --> 1792.1090000000002
orientation of the Equator all that

1789.379 --> 1797.289
stuff yeah that's kind of the staple are

1792.109 --> 1797.289
win talk now everybody knows that but

1797.409 --> 1804.3790000000001
that's not sufficient cause technically

1801.409 --> 1806.3300000000002
if I just keep on doing just that I'm

1804.379 --> 1809.4399999999998
not gonna get out of my financial

1806.33 --> 1813.039
predicament ever it's not gonna happen

1809.44 --> 1815.8990000000001
not like that I doubt it

1813.039 --> 1819.44
you know the way things grown very slow

1815.899 --> 1823.2199999999998
YouTube's pretty much dead it's just it

1819.44 --> 1826.539
it killed the progress of my channel

1823.22 --> 1829.3700000000001
even though I'm daily show everyday and

1826.539 --> 1833.169
multiple multiple hours a day activity

1829.37 --> 1836.7199999999998
on YouTube on other places and connected

1833.169 --> 1839.39
so many time I spend here and even to

1836.72 --> 1844.46
this day even though I'm having four

1839.39 --> 1852.74
year channel with daily show over over

1844.46 --> 1855.89
five seasons I still have only yet a

1852.74 --> 1861.2
little less than 17 hundred subscribers

1855.89 --> 1865.76
how incredibly bizarre is that so yeah

1861.2 --> 1867.65
just me talking here it's blatantly

1865.76 --> 1870.169
obvious it's not gonna get the

1867.65 --> 1872.15
opportunity to grow and to become purely

1870.169 --> 1876.0490000000002
self-sufficient just by that standard

1872.15 --> 1878.48
it's not gonna let me do that because if

1876.049 --> 1881.87
it would I would now have I don't know

1878.48 --> 1884.35
ten thousand subscribers it makes no

1881.87 --> 1884.35
sense to me

1886.21 --> 1891.65
naturally it doesn't make natural sense

1888.919 --> 1894.7700000000002
to me that my channel is in the state it

1891.65 --> 1897.14
is in right now that doesn't matter that

1894.77 --> 1899.35
doesn't make any sense to me I can't

1897.14 --> 1906.95
explain it other than planned

1899.35 --> 1909.02
manipulation for some reason but yeah

1906.95 --> 1911.409
there must be other ways to kind of get

1909.02 --> 1911.4089999999999
out of it

1917.65 --> 1928.42
talk about more topics you say a gem

1920.8 --> 1933.51
what what other subjects are there left

1928.42 --> 1935.71
I about pretty much damn well anything

1933.51 --> 1946.02
anything that's not freaking disgusting

1935.71 --> 1948.91
in dark now what haven't I talked about

1946.02 --> 1953.4
no I'm not gonna talk about Coronas and

1948.91 --> 1957.6100000000001
it's sick of it and not literally

1953.4 --> 1960.0590000000002
spiritually okay I'll take a look dank

1957.61 --> 1960.059
what's that

1966.97 --> 1978.419
oh wow what what Ben garrison through

1975.249 --> 1985.779
that holy [ __ ]

1978.419 --> 1994.6490000000001
damn I didn't know that that's insane

1985.779 --> 1998.22
that is insane that's that's amazing man

1994.649 --> 2001.529
Wow I got a present that that's just

1998.22 --> 2006.239
incredible because I know Ben garrison

2001.529 --> 2008.759
he's like a famous cartoonist it's been

2006.239 --> 2011.909
part of like the Alex Jones Show and

2008.759 --> 2015.1390000000001
Orwell like he's on there it's very

2011.909 --> 2020.3400000000001
famous and that he would show this

2015.139 --> 2023.6589999999999
that's because he's literally hiding the

2020.34 --> 2027.809
globe and the Black Swan in plain sight

2023.659 --> 2031.3690000000001
because yeah making you overlook the

2027.809 --> 2036.45
globe making you overlook the Black Swan

2031.369 --> 2038.4599999999998
by sticking the other backdrop context

2036.45 --> 2040.53
of the lake of death versus the Kuro

2038.46 --> 2043.73
this is just incredible

2040.53 --> 2043.73
[Music]

2046.859 --> 2049.859
Wow

2051.14 --> 2054.64
and it was amazing

2057.59 --> 2067.7200000000003
that's a great find dank thank you for

2060.77 --> 2071.09
that I'm actually gonna see if I can

2067.72 --> 2074.5899999999997
post that in Skype because it's just

2071.09 --> 2074.59
people got to see this

2077.34 --> 2087.619
[Music]

2096.68 --> 2103.98
yeah sorry AJ I'm sorry I'm not going

2099.9 --> 2119.79
into that going into the sodomy industry

2103.98 --> 2124.23
thank you like why why would I want to

2119.79 --> 2128.49
do that you know technically a person

2124.23 --> 2132.33
can do anything as crazy doesn't really

2128.49 --> 2134.49
matter not really it's just that hey I'm

2132.33 --> 2136.67
also trying to teach some really

2134.49 --> 2141.359
freaking complicated things here and

2136.67 --> 2143.25
have this moral thing that I'm trying to

2141.359 --> 2145.7799999999997
do you know it doesn't really go well

2143.25 --> 2148.829
together so

2145.78 --> 2148.829
[Music]

2161.68 --> 2169.8089999999997
why would I why would I do that

2166.48 --> 2171.4900000000002
truth man why would I do experiments

2169.809 --> 2173.2000000000003
supposedly to prove the shape of the

2171.49 --> 2175.299
earth because pretty sure you can't even

2173.2 --> 2177.9399999999996
do the scientific it's do a scientific

2175.299 --> 2180.779
experiment to do that because you can't

2177.94 --> 2184.059
really scientifically prove it however

2180.779 --> 2186.22
why would I personally want to do these

2184.059 --> 2189.009
kinds of things to prove all these

2186.22 --> 2192.819
things when the data is so blatantly and

2189.009 --> 2197.859
widespread out there you know black swan

2192.819 --> 2200.529
images go very far away in pretty much

2197.859 --> 2203.619
doing that what I must do it all myself

2200.529 --> 2210.339
I must this be the sole preponderance of

2203.619 --> 2212.619
evidence let's I don't get it besides

2210.339 --> 2214.92
yeah did you see the weather it's kind

2212.619 --> 2214.92
of shitty

2228.69 --> 2234.18
yeah I'm yeah don't give Nathan any bad

2231.569 --> 2236.069
ideas he's silly enough to maybe do it

2234.18 --> 2243.7799999999997
although no he's probably not because he

2236.069 --> 2248.16
yeah does have a family but no no I

2243.78 --> 2254.13
don't want to be a YouTube cannabis

2248.16 --> 2257.7599999999998
dealer thank you very much you know if I

2254.13 --> 2259.01
I will share what I use how I use it at

2257.76 --> 2266.2200000000003
times when they feel

2259.01 --> 2270.2990000000004
yeah it's relevant what are the usual

2266.22 --> 2272.3689999999997
topics on the show the usual topics on

2270.299 --> 2275.75
the show is starting out what I've

2272.369 --> 2278.21
watched content wise reflecting upon it

2275.75 --> 2281.43
usually flatters related usually

2278.21 --> 2284.549
international politics related usually

2281.43 --> 2288.569
around social engineering and occulted

2284.549 --> 2290.059
structures within society why how the

2288.569 --> 2293.069
mechanisms behind it

2290.059 --> 2295.38
societal design in general all these

2293.069 --> 2298.2
things that is usually what I tend to

2295.38 --> 2301.77
bring up one way or the other and also

2298.2 --> 2304.77
personal psychology like how do double

2301.77 --> 2306.779
thinkers do their thing and why what

2304.77 --> 2308.93
actually transpired in their head as

2306.779 --> 2312.21
they're doing it because I've been there

2308.93 --> 2315.529
up to a certain degree so I remember

2312.21 --> 2318.299
what it is like literally that feeling

2315.529 --> 2320.46
the sensation how your mind makes

2318.299 --> 2329.369
decision when you're in that state so I

2320.46 --> 2332.4900000000002
do that anything else yeah I am about

2329.369 --> 2334.23
healing oh that's the whole point trying

2332.49 --> 2336.8689999999997
to heal myself from all the freaking

2334.23 --> 2339.569
damage I've contracted in society the

2336.869 --> 2346.279
insane world out there certain point

2339.569 --> 2350.279
literally broke my mind and been yeah

2346.279 --> 2353.94
trying to find a sensible way out ever

2350.279 --> 2356.609
since and I've got a lot more courage

2353.94 --> 2360.359
than I used to have but still in my mind

2356.609 --> 2362.13
it's just in relation to everything that

2360.359 --> 2364.47
broke me in the first place

2362.13 --> 2366.75
does seem like yeah some point is

2364.47 --> 2370.259
probably gonna catch up to me one way or

2366.75 --> 2375.539
the other so the only thing I can really

2370.259 --> 2377.43
do is just say screw you I'm gonna try

2375.539 --> 2379.079
to build something right here right now

2377.43 --> 2381.5989999999997
with what's going on right here right

2379.079 --> 2385.71
now and I'm gonna do it to the best of

2381.599 --> 2388.309
my ability and hope it doesn't kill me

2385.71 --> 2388.309
in the end

2389.88 --> 2392.9390000000003
[Music]

2405.69 --> 2412.349
no I hate that song mad world can't

2409.079 --> 2414.539
stand it it's so depressing and what's

2412.349 --> 2416.4300000000003
the point what's the point of doing that

2414.539 --> 2419.369
walking around in the Netherlands being

2416.43 --> 2423.1499999999996
all oh I'm such a victim because

2419.369 --> 2425.46
everybody's stupid and oh and I'm so

2423.15 --> 2428.4
special because I can see it and

2425.46 --> 2431.099
everybody else it's just stupid yeah

2428.4 --> 2433.5
that guess what there's already pretty

2431.099 --> 2436.26
much professional media people doing

2433.5 --> 2438.39
that [ __ ] okay that's how bad the

2436.26 --> 2441.2400000000002
Netherlands has gotten it's like

2438.39 --> 2443.25
Savannah is central sometimes I think

2441.24 --> 2444.24
the entire Netherlands is just worse

2443.25 --> 2449.7
than New York

2444.24 --> 2453.2099999999996
barely can you imagine that but I don't

2449.7 --> 2455.49
want to do that you know why because the

2453.21 --> 2457.619
state of mind that people are in that

2455.49 --> 2460.41
have cut themselves into and just how

2457.619 --> 2465.0
people think it's normal to function and

2460.41 --> 2471.3289999999997
what they're doing it's not just crazy

2465.0 --> 2473.579
it hurts it hurts bad once I really get

2471.329 --> 2478.44
to the oversight of what's going on and

2473.579 --> 2480.9500000000003
not just force myself to sing down just

2478.44 --> 2485.549
to be able to have some kind of pleasant

2480.95 --> 2487.589
communication so no I wouldn't want to

2485.549 --> 2494.5389999999998
do that a video like that I would just

2487.589 --> 2498.049
suck now I'd much prefer to reveal

2494.539 --> 2502.4100000000003
moments where even all these mentally

2498.049 --> 2505.41
sunk down this yeah this mental

2502.41 --> 2509.029
wasteland that's still in between them

2505.41 --> 2512.3089999999997
are people that have not been broken

2509.029 --> 2514.17
that are actually doing kind of good and

2512.309 --> 2517.73
having their own spiritual development

2514.17 --> 2520.579
side much rather show the gems there and

2517.73 --> 2523.98
share that because there are people

2520.579 --> 2526.65
thriving out there actually you know

2523.98 --> 2529.68
with all the talks all the [ __ ]

2526.65 --> 2531.96
everywhere and everybody's gay and it is

2529.68 --> 2534.3289999999997
going on to a greater extent even though

2531.96 --> 2535.63
it seems more like a fad among teenagers

2534.329 --> 2538.2400000000002
and

2535.63 --> 2541.2400000000002
like people in their 20s I wonder how

2538.24 --> 2542.95
long that really will last with that or

2541.24 --> 2544.6899999999996
if they're just gonna one day figure out

2542.95 --> 2547.7799999999997
yes screw this I'm just gonna be a

2544.69 --> 2549.43
[ __ ] normal person now because the

2547.78 --> 2552.6400000000003
system is broken and I'm not gonna get

2549.43 --> 2556.54
any more trinkets from it you know but

2552.64 --> 2559.3599999999997
between that isn't just going out

2556.54 --> 2562.66
looking outside there's a lot of people

2559.36 --> 2564.28
with young children a lot of them I see

2562.66 --> 2567.0099999999998
a lot of them and it makes me kind of

2564.28 --> 2567.73
relieved because yet they're still

2567.01 --> 2569.59
children

2567.73 --> 2573.58
there's still little kids and all age

2569.59 --> 2576.31
categories from babies five-year-olds

2573.58 --> 2578.5299999999997
and eight-year-olds in their 12g

2576.31 --> 2581.2
teenagers old it's all still out there

2578.53 --> 2584.38
and they're not oh they don't all have

2581.2 --> 2586.3599999999997
blue or pink hair and that kind of

2584.38 --> 2592.56
[ __ ] that's just not going on no a

2586.36 --> 2597.3700000000003
lot of normal kids that seem happy and

2592.56 --> 2599.86
their parents seem normal and very well

2597.37 --> 2603.7
yet just being responsible guardians and

2599.86 --> 2608.4700000000003
all that at least on the superficial so

2603.7 --> 2610.87
yeah it's not as bad as they say even

2608.47 --> 2613.3199999999997
though it is that crazy [ __ ] is still

2610.87 --> 2613.3199999999997
going down

2618.42 --> 2621.469
[Music]

2627.08 --> 2635.93
yeah by the way I do in general spot a

2630.41 --> 2639.29
lot lot women especially in their 20s

2635.93 --> 2641.5
maybe even in their thirties that have

2639.29 --> 2645.5299999999997
pink or blue hair as you see it a lot

2641.5 --> 2648.95
but in all not the same person just I'd

2645.53 --> 2652.28
say that there's at least like at least

2648.95 --> 2655.91
50 women maybe hundreds

2652.28 --> 2660.9100000000003
alone in this very city that have blue

2655.91 --> 2663.35
or pink hair it's pretty atrocious but

2660.91 --> 2672.5
nothing I could do about it except look

2663.35 --> 2675.64
away yeah I'm always looking around what

2672.5 --> 2675.64
else is there to do

2696.93 --> 2701.8799999999997
hmm okay that's an interesting concept

2699.75 --> 2705.15
tiny bumble if you say that there has

2701.88 --> 2706.7400000000002
always been that many gay people and

2705.15 --> 2708.89
that they're more comfortable I don't

2706.74 --> 2711.95
know I don't know if that is true

2708.89 --> 2715.92
because I'm pretty sure that a lot of

2711.95 --> 2719.3999999999996
kids and teenagers literally get

2715.92 --> 2723.1800000000003
indoctrinated by teachers about gender

2719.4 --> 2727.58
fluidity and about escaping the standard

2723.18 --> 2732.7799999999997
general that becomes like a thing that

2727.58 --> 2735.0499999999997
if you if you don't basically step away

2732.78 --> 2738.21
from the standard role that is

2735.05 --> 2740.61
supposedly given to you by the

2738.21 --> 2743.4
patriarchy or whatever nonsense source

2740.61 --> 2745.56
they can bring up as a straw man then

2743.4 --> 2747.7200000000003
you're gonna be pointed at it's like who

2745.56 --> 2753.5099999999998
you're just a gender stereotyping

2747.72 --> 2755.64
why aren't you gay that [ __ ] I don't

2753.51 --> 2757.98
know I don't know if it's even that bad

2755.64 --> 2759.33
here you know it probably pretty bad in

2757.98 --> 2762.18
the United States I don't know if it's

2759.33 --> 2763.83
that bad over here it's just I think

2762.18 --> 2767.5699999999997
that a lot of people Dutch people are

2763.83 --> 2770.94
just more of a suck up yet in naturally

2767.57 --> 2773.2200000000003
like almost be encouraged it's like take

2770.94 --> 2776.16
away the stigma of just being a go along

2773.22 --> 2779.6699999999996
to get along suck up so that a lot more

2776.16 --> 2781.5899999999997
people literally like become gay out of

2779.67 --> 2783.87
some kind of virtual career choice

2781.59 --> 2787.2000000000003
because I think it helps their chances I

2783.87 --> 2791.8199999999997
think that happens a lot it is

2787.2 --> 2800.7799999999997
disgusting it's absolutely atrocious but

2791.82 --> 2800.78
people do that but yeah

2802.98 --> 2807.749
just glad I didn't yeah

2822.23 --> 2840.16
boof oh god mark colored that's that's

2828.68 --> 2844.43
just terrible i man it's just crazy to

2840.16 --> 2847.8799999999997
be a normal kid or well normal just not

2844.43 --> 2851.66
swept debate by this liberal euphoria

2847.88 --> 2854.78
nonsense craziness to be in the school

2851.66 --> 2859.0099999999998
like that and trying to be normal trying

2854.78 --> 2862.13
to be Christian that's like the that's

2859.01 --> 2864.5200000000004
potentially a battle on its own crazy

2862.13 --> 2864.52
[ __ ]

2870.93 --> 2883.06
right good servant yeah well people

2875.17 --> 2886.12
certainly have been telling me that it's

2883.06 --> 2889.2999999999997
just all these freaking gay businessmen

2886.12 --> 2891.7599999999998
out there just begging for the

2889.3 --> 2897.3300000000004
opportunity to help me out under

2891.76 --> 2897.3300000000004
specific conditions yeah yeah as it's

2898.35 --> 2910.99
really aggravating really Tom Parker

2907.84 --> 2912.9100000000003
yeah well not right now because I pretty

2910.99 --> 2916.6899999999996
much basically came out as being

2912.91 --> 2920.3799999999997
anti-gay for by today's standards you

2916.69 --> 2922.51
know because I say hey I am not gay

2920.38 --> 2925.87
I don't like gay it makes me disgusting

2922.51 --> 2929.2000000000003
if it literally makes me throw up the

2925.87 --> 2936.19
sexuality thing literally makes me throw

2929.2 --> 2939.52
up and then I'm like oh he's Oh blah

2936.19 --> 2942.4
blah sweaters or it's all wrong so yeah

2939.52 --> 2948.21
then but yeah back in the day when I was

2942.4 --> 2950.7400000000002
still in the Gaussian you betcha I had I

2948.21 --> 2955.96
probably had more offers than I care to

2950.74 --> 2958.56
remember they truly and yeah freakin

2955.96 --> 2964.15
walked away every single time because I

2958.56 --> 2967.5299999999997
am NOT gonna violate my body and spirit

2964.15 --> 2971.08
is such a disgusting way just a little

2967.53 --> 2977.17
bit more shackles you know not gonna do

2971.08 --> 2981.69
it I can't I can't it would just it

2977.17 --> 2986.44
would end me I knew that so I didn't

2981.69 --> 2988.78
just got away I rather like set through

2986.44 --> 2991.15
all of that being confronted with that

2988.78 --> 2996.34
just to know how freakin bad it really

2991.15 --> 3001.7000000000003
is how horrific the society has been

2996.34 --> 3001.7000000000003
engineered horrific

3014.819 --> 3021.41
Wow Wow sounds like you might be banned

3017.969 --> 3021.41
in my humble opinion

3067.16 --> 3073.0099999999998
yeah that's just brilliant man just act

3070.37 --> 3075.98
like I'm gay you know if you want to go

3073.01 --> 3077.57
for popularity I'm the only short run if

3075.98 --> 3083.47
you want to get persistent to give you a

3077.57 --> 3086.81
handout yeah we'll just just be as

3083.47 --> 3088.52
disgustingly satanic concerning

3086.81 --> 3092.0
narratives in opinion as you can

3088.52 --> 3094.25
possibly muster without instantly

3092.0 --> 3097.49
killing yourself and yeah you get all

3094.25 --> 3100.99
the attention in the world and oh they

3097.49 --> 3103.6099999999997
will all come all your your savior

3100.99 --> 3106.85
you've lowered the bar for us once again

3103.61 --> 3109.9100000000003
thank you so much we'll help you out

3106.85 --> 3111.5899999999997
just please continue to destroy society

3109.91 --> 3122.0
and we'll give you anything you need

3111.59 --> 3122.81
please yeah yeah yeah I think there's

3122.0 --> 3126.83
plenty out there

3122.81 --> 3131.35
like that they don't need another person

3126.83 --> 3134.0299999999997
acting like a total anti human demon

3131.35 --> 3135.3199999999997
even though yeah they're gonna do that

3134.03 --> 3137.8700000000003
for the money then they're gonna do that

3135.32 --> 3139.61
for the money yeah they just forget that

3137.87 --> 3149.1099999999997
once you go there there's really no way

3139.61 --> 3149.11
back so yeah good luck with that

3174.12 --> 3180.65
yeah yeah good monotone Parker it

3177.87 --> 3180.65
certainly can't

3198.32 --> 3201.5190000000002
[Music]

3205.5 --> 3212.98
yeah anyway I really need to figure out

3210.97 --> 3216.5499999999997
a way to talk more about Flat Earth I've

3212.98 --> 3218.41
been considering uh well I think

3216.55 --> 3221.8300000000004
considering this before even you know

3218.41 --> 3225.73
getting a discord panel and I wonder now

3221.83 --> 3229.12
like okay what type of discord panel

3225.73 --> 3231.76
could I tap into that during my show

3229.12 --> 3235.33
time during 2:00 p.m. apps to them time

3231.76 --> 3237.19
to three p.m. em so damn time why would

3235.33 --> 3240.58
people normally be that I could drag in

3237.19 --> 3243.34
a panel because yeah a flatter disk or

3240.58 --> 3246.79
24/7 seems to have a decent panelist

3243.34 --> 3250.2000000000003
even with some parlors they get me a lot

3246.79 --> 3254.41
of them new me even as I came on so

3250.2 --> 3256.54
might be good to literally talk very

3254.41 --> 3260.02
specifically about Flat Earth more

3256.54 --> 3263.55
because yeah you know flat the the whole

3260.02 --> 3266.59
Flat Earth issue even with all my

3263.55 --> 3268.3900000000003
conceptions the different possibility of

3266.59 --> 3269.71
the realm layout and all that even with

3268.39 --> 3271.72
all that knowledge and all the

3269.71 --> 3275.29
presupposition of routes that I can take

3271.72 --> 3279.25
all of that it still gets buried under

3275.29 --> 3282.46
so many other things societal things and

3279.25 --> 3284.62
all that news things it just gets buried

3282.46 --> 3287.5
underneath it all in this show every

3284.62 --> 3289.7799999999997
time only way to really keep me on track

3287.5 --> 3291.91
is literally by having somebody else

3289.78 --> 3295.1400000000003
asking me questions about flatter

3291.91 --> 3298.21
specifically or something like that

3295.14 --> 3307.93
because it's kind of hard to stay on the

3298.21 --> 3310.15
topic yes clouds behind the Sun that

3307.93 --> 3312.4199999999996
happened a lot especially when I was

3310.15 --> 3312.42
younger

3331.63 --> 3337.539
now of course I also have had long hair

3334.599 --> 3341.549
for a very long time since I was roughly

3337.539 --> 3347.739
twelve that didn't exactly help at first

3341.549 --> 3351.66
you know now of course I yeah well let's

3347.739 --> 3358.089
just say there are more visual signs

3351.66 --> 3361.5389999999998
that do kind of prove that I am a guy so

3358.089 --> 3364.089
people don't mistake me for going as

3361.539 --> 3367.349
much might also the mustache have some

3364.089 --> 3367.349
light something to do with it

3373.77 --> 3383.5099999999998
yeah cornrows what is that I don't know

3380.46 --> 3383.51
what that is Hana koala

3384.01 --> 3387.2090000000003
[Music]

3394.45 --> 3402.2
no stake it's in yeah that's not true

3398.319 --> 3405.799
Nathan Oakley only comes across as an

3402.2 --> 3408.4399999999996
absolute [ __ ] to absolute retards

3405.799 --> 3412.9
that come there and presume they can

3408.44 --> 3415.039
assert their society baseline

3412.9 --> 3418.2490000000003
out-of-date five year out of data

3415.039 --> 3420.44
argument [ __ ] if you don't see that

3418.249 --> 3423.1899999999996
yeah then it's just gonna sound all

3420.44 --> 3426.9790000000003
really really rude really down

3423.19 --> 3428.96
smashing well that is because everything

3426.979 --> 3431.1189999999997
that he does has a good reason and if

3428.96 --> 3432.7690000000002
you're too dumb to see that then you got

3431.119 --> 3439.9100000000003
a problem and it'll just look like he's

3432.769 --> 3442.9399999999996
angry and mean yeah I know I don't know

3439.91 --> 3446.269
if I've never seen cornrows good service

3442.94 --> 3447.739
I don't know what it is if I don't know

3446.269 --> 3453.279
what it is I don't know if I've seen it

3447.739 --> 3457.339
or not know I want to do a better job

3453.279 --> 3460.579
because I don't have despite I don't

3457.339 --> 3463.4
have to hatred in me I don't hate ball

3460.579 --> 3466.309
religion that much even I think it's

3463.4 --> 3474.92
dumb I think it's delusional I'm used to

3466.309 --> 3475.579
be there I my I'm too diplomatic in

3474.92 --> 3480.71
nature

3475.579 --> 3481.759
I would not hammer them down for their

3480.71 --> 3485.21
crazy doublespeak

3481.759 --> 3488.66
I would just laugh and then kind of move

3485.21 --> 3490.279
on and let it be try to get them back

3488.66 --> 3492.89
into some kind of back and forth

3490.279 --> 3495.859
conversation because I don't want to

3492.89 --> 3498.049
basically break off the conversation by

3495.859 --> 3500.359
immediately pointing in every piece of

3498.049 --> 3503.739
the delusion that they uphold I can do

3500.359 --> 3503.739
it it's not my thing

3508.34 --> 3518.4100000000003
Nathan can do that I just don't have to

3512.12 --> 3520.67
I don't have the will I'm too diplomatic

3518.41 --> 3522.62
even though I can get freaking pissed

3520.67 --> 3527.08
off but even that pissed off this is

3522.62 --> 3536.7999999999997
always going to be over behavior always

3527.08 --> 3536.7999999999997
over the actual social actions that's it

3543.5 --> 3552.23
to badge batch that's sorry but I don't

3550.13 --> 3558.38
know you know what is he what does a

3552.23 --> 3560.119
noble price at this point even mean just

3558.38 --> 3563.42
look at history who's getting these

3560.119 --> 3566.06
prizes can you find a single individual

3563.42 --> 3569.2400000000002
that isn't somehow entangled into some

3566.06 --> 3572.98
really dark or controversial [ __ ] or

3569.24 --> 3576.3799999999997
just blatant lies can you find anyone

3572.98 --> 3580.34
why would anyone even want an award like

3576.38 --> 3581.4500000000003
that it's almost like a Satan award like

3580.34 --> 3584.0
this person

3581.45 --> 3586.6699999999996
yeah we're awarding him for something

3584.0 --> 3589.34
that we're saying is good even though

3586.67 --> 3592.369
the practical result from it on the long

3589.34 --> 3596.15
run and they know as they do it will be

3592.369 --> 3601.58
highly detrimental I think that's pretty

3596.15 --> 3603.9500000000003
much how to do it it's basically the

3601.58 --> 3605.75
go-fuck-yourself Awards if you really

3603.95 --> 3609.1699999999996
think this is real then you deserve

3605.75 --> 3611.589
everything that's coming award don't you

3609.17 --> 3611.589
think so

3611.8 --> 3614.989
[Music]

3622.83 --> 3630.94
don't you think so if you can point at a

3628.66 --> 3632.89
single exception in history where some

3630.94 --> 3638.29
of these people did get a Nobel Prize

3632.89 --> 3639.94
and they actually deserved it well well

3638.29 --> 3642.49
that becomes kind of self contradictory

3639.94 --> 3646.15
because it is kind of a detriment so I

3642.49 --> 3649.93
think nobody got one that wouldn't

3646.15 --> 3653.29
deserve it it's like to me I just see it

3649.93 --> 3655.6
as a yeah Satan it's like the Satan

3653.29 --> 3657.34
award it's like oh you went along with

3655.6 --> 3660.22
the system you you allowed yourself to

3657.34 --> 3663.94
get [ __ ] up to become part of the

3660.22 --> 3669.06
problem that that basically is squishing

3663.94 --> 3669.06
people in society so you get this award

3673.41 --> 3683.31
so yeah why I don't know if you've got a

3681.01 --> 3687.25
prize like this would it not be

3683.31 --> 3691.93
basically wiser to just reject it if you

3687.25 --> 3696.13
were a good person or what somebody

3691.93 --> 3698.35
typically just say oh oh the resume I

3696.13 --> 3701.86
have a resume thing I can show this to

3698.35 --> 3705.5499999999997
people I will get better jobs well yeah

3701.86 --> 3708.55
that see but then you're kind of doing

3705.55 --> 3715.8900000000003
it again it's typical yeah it's just so

3708.55 --> 3718.78
Satan it's go along to get along

3715.89 --> 3723.48
taking the detriment in the hopes that

3718.78 --> 3727.5600000000004
people won't see it just to move up

3723.48 --> 3730.15
financially somehow get better

3727.56 --> 3734.37
societal reaction from the bottom up

3730.15 --> 3734.37
from the Dumbo's yeah

3742.25 --> 3748.38
yeah so stick with signatures you've

3746.039 --> 3751.4100000000003
been in my chat for two days now are you

3748.38 --> 3755.579
gonna get to any point because your

3751.41 --> 3757.859
attempts to just blatantly try to divide

3755.579 --> 3760.289
me from the people that I hang out with

3757.859 --> 3767.4
that I can know and trust up to a

3760.289 --> 3770.76
certain degree and why let me let me

3767.4 --> 3772.829
guess your suggestion is just stop going

3770.76 --> 3775.6800000000003
to the Flat Earth debates just stop it

3772.829 --> 3778.8900000000003
you know it's all bad it's going down

3775.68 --> 3783.359
Nathan is just bullyboys

3778.89 --> 3785.99
evil and yeah I just need to do

3783.359 --> 3790.319
something to replace it you know just

3785.99 --> 3792.5389999999998
yeah compete yeah we can get Arwen to

3790.319 --> 3796.23
step away from everything that is Bill

3792.539 --> 3798.079
and trusted bill to compete yeah that

3796.23 --> 3800.13
that will be brilliant because then

3798.079 --> 3802.799
first he would do it for a good reason

3800.13 --> 3804.299
and then suddenly everybody would be

3802.799 --> 3806.549
like why are you being a dick are you

3804.299 --> 3808.77
why are you acting like the new Randi or

3806.549 --> 3812.0099999999998
something and then you'll give up and

3808.77 --> 3815.069
then yeah no more no more good sparks no

3812.01 --> 3817.23
more purity moments no more brilliant

3815.069 --> 3819.48
ideas just falling in a moment being

3817.23 --> 3822.0
in-between it all so everything could

3819.48 --> 3823.92
just gradually slide down a little

3822.0 --> 3825.75
quicker into the darkness that's what

3823.92 --> 3829.17
you want don't you that's what you want

3825.75 --> 3833.789
it's not gonna happen I know how these

3829.17 --> 3838.77
things work you can't manipulate me

3833.789 --> 3843.5690000000004
like that doesn't work anymore it really

3838.77 --> 3846.599
doesn't and trust me people have tried

3843.569 --> 3847.589
over the last year's oh they've tried my

3846.599 --> 3851.6000000000004
god

3847.589 --> 3858.199
left right it's not gonna work
