so

81.36 --> 85.979
yeah guys

83.58 --> 88.38
it's been a while

85.979 --> 90.72

88.38 --> 92.64
the weather today is

90.72 --> 96.67999999999999
[Music]

92.64 --> 96.68
kind of clouded right now

97.5 --> 104.52
it was really like super clear sky this

100.68 --> 108.24000000000001
morning for a bit but yeah then

104.52 --> 110.88
that ended pretty much

108.24 --> 114.74
doesn't seem to be too much wind

110.88 --> 114.74
clouds are just kind of hanging there

116.939 --> 121.579
but it is yeah it is kind of cold

119.28 --> 121.57900000000001
outside

126.18 --> 131.11
hey Jess Palmer first in chap good to

132.42 --> 142.94
it is Friday the 10th of November 2022

138.959 --> 142.94
and yeah I'm starting late because

143.22 --> 148.2
I overslept a bit and I literally

146.16 --> 150.12
literally woke up like five minutes

148.2 --> 152.819
before I would normally start the show

150.12 --> 154.26
so yeah that's most of the reason as to

152.819 --> 156.35999999999999
why I'm late

154.26 --> 159.12
not even because I went to bed all that

156.36 --> 161.81900000000002
late it's just that this morning I had

159.12 --> 163.68
this really deep dreamy sleep I'm still

161.819 --> 167.17999999999998
kind of

163.68 --> 167.18
migrating out of that

168.48 --> 174.35999999999999
so sorry for being late it is going to

171.42 --> 177.01899999999998
be a bit of a short show today

174.36 --> 177.019
foreign

183.71 --> 188.959
[Music]

185.34 --> 188.959
what do you mean Jess farmer

189.3 --> 191.959
in the snow

194.22 --> 197.35999999999999
what are you talking about

199.68 --> 203.59900000000002
[Music]

200.94 --> 203.599
uh

208.2 --> 211.2
foreign

217.34 --> 223.27
Trails yeah I know but

220.799 --> 226.709
your chem snow

223.27 --> 226.709
[Music]

229.14 --> 232.95999999999998
they made it snow three days late I

232.26 --> 235.739
okay

232.96 --> 238.019
[Music]

235.739 --> 240.18
well look unless you can actually find

238.019 --> 242.28
some kind of weird chemicals in that

240.18 --> 245.519
snow it's kind of

242.28 --> 247.799
weird to call it chem snow because if

245.519 --> 249.56
it's just snow that were apparently

247.799 --> 251.22
assisted by

249.56 --> 254.34
geoengineering

251.22 --> 256.5
that is one thing but to call it chem

254.34 --> 258.359
snow yeah you're better you better damn

256.5 --> 259.799
well find some chemicals in that snow

258.359 --> 262.69899999999996
then

259.799 --> 262.69899999999996
if you know what I mean

266.22 --> 269.66
or whatever anyway

272.12 --> 276.36
[Music]

288.479 --> 291.32
foreign

294.33 --> 310.769
[Music]

311.88 --> 316.28
15 degrees Celsius okay

329.84 --> 336.59999999999997
wait is it Friday no it's Thursday look

333.6 --> 339.24
at me I said it was Thursday

336.6 --> 342.24
it isn't it's I mean I said it's Friday

339.24 --> 346.08
it's Thursday actually it was silly me

342.24 --> 348.32
ah anyway hello Mike sadunich good to

346.08 --> 348.32
see you

348.69 --> 355.25
[Music]

357.37 --> 363.0
[Music]

367.36 --> 374.2
[Music]

376.86 --> 383.36
yeah the title for today's show I came

379.199 --> 383.36
up with during jimbob stream yesterday

383.46 --> 389.46
I think was team upstream or was it at

386.699 --> 391.44
flat side I don't remember

389.46 --> 393.18
but it's yeah it's a saying I see it

391.44 --> 394.979
said before I think even on the early

393.18 --> 397.68
bird show it's just

394.979 --> 399.78
a funny way of

397.68 --> 401.039
yeah it's basically just a joke simple

399.78 --> 404.35999999999996
joke

401.039 --> 407.81899999999996
but yeah I did manage to expound upon it

404.36 --> 409.259
and actually compare humans to human

407.819 --> 411.53900000000004
beings

409.259 --> 413.28000000000003
because what does a human being need to

411.539 --> 417.65999999999997
do

413.28 --> 421.02
well they need to get into the dirt

417.66 --> 423.24
and set some roots

421.02 --> 426.24
and then

423.24 --> 429.319
they can basically turn into a

426.24 --> 429.319
a beanstalk

429.78 --> 434.58
that when guided with proper nutrition

432.72 --> 437.03900000000004
and vision

434.58 --> 439.02
can reach into the

437.039 --> 442.86
into the clouds

439.02 --> 443.74
right so that's the way of the human

442.86 --> 445.56
being

443.74 --> 447.479
[Music]

445.56 --> 448.82
ah

447.479 --> 452.22999999999996
hey George Sanford

448.82 --> 452.23
[Music]

453.0 --> 457.439
seven Jesus

454.23 --> 457.439
[Music]

459.65 --> 464.07
[Music]

467.05 --> 471.259
[Music]

475.919 --> 478.919
foreign

508.94 --> 513.319
no you're very busy these days

514.33 --> 528.38
[Music]

532.41 --> 537.13
[Music]

539.339 --> 544.8800000000001
right anyway let's see

541.68 --> 544.88
have I been up to

554.64 --> 559.88
I was watching Jim Bob at least that was

557.459 --> 559.88
hilarious

566.76 --> 570.3199999999999
I think that was it

570.36 --> 573.8000000000001
oh yeah uh

573.839 --> 580.7
watch the movie

576.0 --> 580.7
action movie on Netflix

583.14 --> 589.22
nothing really that's worth sharing but

586.56 --> 589.2199999999999
uh

594.779 --> 597.4399999999999
aiming

599.64 --> 604.459
right

600.98 --> 604.4590000000001
let's see

610.68 --> 615.14
oh yeah lift the veil at night

616.26 --> 621.6
Nathan Stopman I yeah I think just his

619.38 --> 624.779
streams are kind of funny

621.6 --> 629.16
because I just visit them on D live

624.779 --> 632.82
but he's he is like a bit of a

629.16 --> 635.459
he's just so weird in his way like he is

632.82 --> 637.2600000000001
like a bit of an oddball to me I mean

635.459 --> 639.06
there probably might be a whole bunch of

637.26 --> 641.7
people like that out there but he is a

639.06 --> 642.7199999999999
bit of an oddball to me but he does say

641.7 --> 646.1400000000001
like

642.72 --> 649.62
I like conspiracy theories and [ __ ] like

646.14 --> 652.56
you have any and then that just really

649.62 --> 655.32
kind of triggers me to get really

652.56 --> 657.5
out there sometimes

655.32 --> 660.9590000000001
[Music]

657.5 --> 662.519
so I thrown some pretty bizarre ideas at

660.959 --> 664.6199999999999
him

662.519 --> 667.1
because I I wouldn't normally do that

664.62 --> 669.23
but because he just kind of likes that

667.1 --> 671.519
then I do do that

669.23 --> 672.899
[Music]

671.519 --> 676.86
so

672.899 --> 680.16
it's always kind of fun with his streams

676.86 --> 682.8000000000001
although I yeah his overall attitude I

680.16 --> 685.68
do have objections to it

682.8 --> 688.14
he seems a little bit too shivery to me

685.68 --> 692.06
sometimes

688.14 --> 692.06
a little bit too nervous

692.24 --> 697.74
but uh yeah that's maybe it's just his

695.88 --> 699.42
way of going through it maybe that's his

697.74 --> 702.26
response to

699.42 --> 705.4799999999999
the winter is coming anyway

702.26 --> 707.519
those flutter Sage good to see you Thor

705.48 --> 710.36
Casey

707.519 --> 710.36
foreign

722.339 --> 727.3800000000001
because

724.56 --> 730.1999999999999
normally I'd like either have some time

727.38 --> 734.06
to kind of like wake up slowly

730.2 --> 734.0600000000001
which really does kind of take an hour

735.18 --> 740.2199999999999
or I have to like get moving I get out

737.88 --> 742.019
for groceries because then the movement

740.22 --> 743.82
like it really gets my system going

742.019 --> 746.4590000000001
makes me sweat like [ __ ] and all that

743.82 --> 748.74
but it does actually wake me up

746.459 --> 751.0189999999999
but yeah I did not have I did not have

748.74 --> 755.0
either today

751.019 --> 755.0
right hopefully by the end of the show

755.399 --> 759.66
I'll be a little bit more fluid sorry

757.68 --> 761.579
about that

759.66 --> 763.38
tomorrow

761.579 --> 765.66
is going to be an hour later starting

763.38 --> 769.2
and I'm sure I'm gonna be

765.66 --> 771.36
just fine my weekend shows are usually

769.2 --> 773.34
pretty awesome

771.36 --> 776.69
I like to think so at least

773.34 --> 776.69
[Music]

782.22 --> 786.4200000000001
maybe more of them conspiracies

786.92 --> 796.019
conspiracy theories right oh check my

791.7 --> 798.74
PayPal okay thank you letter Sage

796.019 --> 798.74
I will

814.91 --> 819.68
[Music]

817.139 --> 819.6800000000001
foreign

821.91 --> 826.0899999999999
[Music]

831.62 --> 836.779
thank you

833.579 --> 836.779
thank you for the PayPal

847.37 --> 850.559
[Music]

853.019 --> 858.48
thanks for having Sage

855.0 --> 859.73
for you your continued support

858.48 --> 862.95
uh

859.73 --> 862.95
[Music]

879.42 --> 883.199
yeah just move around there's a lot to

881.279 --> 885.72
wake you up yeah well it's it gets your

883.199 --> 887.03
blood flowing and that's really the big

885.72 --> 890.38
thing

887.03 --> 890.38
[Music]

891.06 --> 896.579
right once your blood really gets

893.519 --> 897.54
slowing then certain type of veins also

896.579 --> 901.62
start

897.54 --> 905.3
widening up Etc and that just gets as

901.62 --> 905.3
well the next level process going

907.38 --> 913.82
right instead of just like the default

910.019 --> 913.82
bloodstream when you're sleeping

917.339 --> 922.0790000000001
although a lot of regeneration processes

919.68 --> 925.579
do actually happen while I sleep

922.079 --> 925.579
anyway hey LSG

926.54 --> 934.5999999999999
[Music]

938.72 --> 944.4590000000001
thank me for my hard work is it hard

942.06 --> 948.0
work I don't know if it's hard work it's

944.459 --> 949.9799999999999
dedicated work is it hard well it's

948.0 --> 952.399
dedicated

949.98 --> 956.72
I mean is it really like

952.399 --> 956.72
hard to do what I do

957.18 --> 962.579
well if you're not in a position to be

960.72 --> 965.1600000000001
able to

962.579 --> 967.8599999999999
like you have other responsibilities

965.16 --> 972.36
other focuses you need to maintain or

967.86 --> 975.86
even if you'd have like a family yeah

972.36 --> 975.86
then it would be pretty hard

976.38 --> 982.4399999999999
for me it's not hard but it does really

979.079 --> 987.3199999999999
take my focus

982.44 --> 987.32
and I've kind of arranged it like this

988.86 --> 992.1
thank you

990.12 --> 995.279
if I have to be fully honest I'm not

992.1 --> 997.44
going to say like Oh Me Oh poor me how

995.279 --> 1001.519
if I come to this position in life no

997.44 --> 1003.5
I'm pretty sure that I kind of chose it

1001.519 --> 1005.779
now that choice might not be entirely

1003.5 --> 1008.32
Without Regrets

1005.779 --> 1008.32
but

1010.399 --> 1017.019
I am still kind of glad that I am who I

1013.519 --> 1017.019
am doing what I do

1017.18 --> 1020.3599999999999
I have a lot of room I have a lot of

1019.399 --> 1023.66
like

1020.36 --> 1024.98
room to if I suddenly out of nowhere get

1023.66 --> 1027.3799999999999
like

1024.98 --> 1030.26
triggered and I'm not talking about

1027.38 --> 1032.5400000000002
triggered by somebody calling bad names

1030.26 --> 1034.52
or something but just

1032.54 --> 1037.04
because I'm high tension and somebody

1034.52 --> 1039.559
says something that just really super

1037.04 --> 1041.72
ugly to me for some bizarre reason

1039.559 --> 1043.1
then well I still have a lot of room and

1041.72 --> 1044.78
space here

1043.1 --> 1048.4389999999999
right

1044.78 --> 1049.48
so I'm less cramped and more flexible to

1048.439 --> 1053.26
have

1049.48 --> 1056.3600000000001
uh quick and effective

1053.26 --> 1059.9
non-damaging Escape Routes

1056.36 --> 1062.1789999999999
when functioning on a high tension level

1059.9 --> 1064.7
which is yeah the high tension level is

1062.179 --> 1068.24
also the high inside level right I mean

1064.7 --> 1070.5800000000002
the more the higher the consciousness

1068.24 --> 1072.799
the more the weight the more the

1070.58 --> 1075.08
challenges well if you're going to go

1072.799 --> 1076.82
there then you either stay very short

1075.08 --> 1079.52
because otherwise you're going to

1076.82 --> 1082.059
suddenly start damaging

1079.52 --> 1085.78
your lower functioning

1082.059 --> 1085.78
responsibilities or

1088.7 --> 1093.32
yeah or you you don't have them and then

1091.64 --> 1095.1200000000001
you can't keep doing it

1093.32 --> 1096.98
and that's kind of the position where

1095.12 --> 1099.559
I'm at

1096.98 --> 1101.919
so in that sense I am kind of like a

1099.559 --> 1101.9189999999999
priest

1103.46 --> 1106.299
roughly

1106.52 --> 1113.0
in ways I detract with my Earthly

1110.48 --> 1114.919
manifestation in order to achieve a

1113.0 --> 1116.9
function

1114.919 --> 1121.94
now this is not part of an organized

1116.9 --> 1126.0800000000002
religion this is purely me this is my

1121.94 --> 1129.02
personal priesthood My Religion

1126.08 --> 1131.6599999999999
which drives me to do it so nobody's

1129.02 --> 1135.679
telling me to do it or to stop it

1131.66 --> 1138.22
that has any kind of impact on me

1135.679 --> 1138.22
right

1141.7 --> 1145.8400000000001
well that certainly got me going

1148.7 --> 1152.539
also yeah I take supplements and

1150.74 --> 1155.539
sometimes a supplements hit a little

1152.539 --> 1159.28
hard on my stomach I do take them on my

1155.539 --> 1159.28
on a bare stomach

1161.9 --> 1165.5
all right but normally what I do is I

1164.539 --> 1168.5
take them

1165.5 --> 1169.82
then I go out for groceries then yeah it

1168.5 --> 1172.22
may be a little tough because when the

1169.82 --> 1173.8999999999999
blood gets flowing and they're sitting

1172.22 --> 1176.059
in my stomach sometimes it can be a

1173.9 --> 1177.74
little challenging never like throwing

1176.059 --> 1181.22
them up or anything

1177.74 --> 1183.26
but after that it's like all settled

1181.22 --> 1187.039
no I haven't done that so I kind of like

1183.26 --> 1189.7
took it right before the shows

1187.039 --> 1192.89
oh well I'll get through it

1189.7 --> 1192.89
[Music]

1193.94 --> 1198.8200000000002
the quick song

1195.52 --> 1198.82
that's okay

1198.86 --> 1203.539
now coffee doesn't really wake me up

1201.2 --> 1205.52
like that it just makes me sick that's

1203.539 --> 1207.74
why I don't drink coffee anymore

1205.52 --> 1209.9
especially

1207.74 --> 1211.46
waking up

1209.9 --> 1214.52
but uh

1211.46 --> 1217.28
no a good song for me also wakes me up

1214.52 --> 1218.78
that's why I have my mind in a box short

1217.28 --> 1220.58
list

1218.78 --> 1223.94
four songs

1220.58 --> 1227.539
the the best songs which are extremely

1223.94 --> 1227.539
stimulating like

1227.78 --> 1232.28
like intellectually

1230.539 --> 1234.05
contextually

1232.28 --> 1236.12
and melodically

1234.05 --> 1240.02
[Music]

1236.12 --> 1242.4799999999998
so yeah that I did actually listen to it

1240.02 --> 1244.4
before the show I sometimes I do it and

1242.48 --> 1248.059
sometimes I'm already all filled up and

1244.4 --> 1250.16
I don't really need any more stimulants

1248.059 --> 1253.16
and sometimes it's like

1250.16 --> 1254.6000000000001
like aha I feel like I don't really want

1253.16 --> 1256.1000000000001
to wake up and then I just start playing

1254.6 --> 1259.78
that and then

1256.1 --> 1259.78
I'll get going very quickly

1260.059 --> 1264.02
it's great music

1261.86 --> 1266.26
heard it so many times it's good every

1264.02 --> 1266.26
time

1266.66 --> 1272.3600000000001
like all these songs I've never heard

1269.419 --> 1274.3400000000001
them a single time where I was like not

1272.36 --> 1276.9189999999999
now or something

1274.34 --> 1278.84
it might be like oh I can't handle this

1276.919 --> 1281.6000000000001
now because I'm way too overtense I need

1278.84 --> 1284.48
silence around me in like a weak moment

1281.6 --> 1287.78
but never like I'm listening to these

1284.48 --> 1290.1200000000001
songs and like oh not now no it's that's

1287.78 --> 1291.559
why I picked them I mean it's four songs

1290.12 --> 1294.8799999999999
out of like

1291.559 --> 1294.8799999999999
two or three hundred

1295.4 --> 1301.22
not all of the Mind in the boxes songs

1297.38 --> 1305.5
are Fantastical they're all decent

1301.22 --> 1305.5
but anyway I'm rambling

1311.0 --> 1314.84
the blood moon in the morning

1313.4 --> 1317.539
oh

1314.84 --> 1319.58
oh that is weird

1317.539 --> 1322.6
that is very weird to see a blood moon

1319.58 --> 1322.6
in the morning yeah

1322.7 --> 1325.8400000000001
I haven't seen it

1329.419 --> 1334.48
I did hear about it that it was there

1331.22 --> 1334.48
but yeah I mean

1335.72 --> 1341.33
to be fair I'm not particularly

1339.4 --> 1344.24
fascinated by a blood moon

1341.33 --> 1347.1789999999999
[Music]

1344.24 --> 1350.059
for me concerning the moon what matters

1347.179 --> 1352.4
much more is just like is it getting

1350.059 --> 1353.48
full again is it very close to being

1352.4 --> 1356.299
full

1353.48 --> 1359.539
and then when it's full and then oh it's

1356.299 --> 1362.179
it's it's growing less because why why

1359.539 --> 1364.4
does that matter to me because like

1362.179 --> 1365.9
there is a palpable

1364.4 --> 1368.9
energy

1365.9 --> 1371.8600000000001
alteration

1368.9 --> 1371.8600000000001
in these phases

1371.96 --> 1379.28
like when the Moon is growing Fuller

1375.44 --> 1382.52
there's always a lot of like like eager

1379.28 --> 1386.72
like go go go go go energy in the air

1382.52 --> 1388.76
not always like good effective it's just

1386.72 --> 1391.78
restlessness but like the restlessness

1388.76 --> 1391.78
in an eager way

1392.12 --> 1397.1789999999999
that would that's like maximize that a

1394.34 --> 1397.1789999999999
full moon sometimes

1397.46 --> 1403.64
but can also turn into anxiety and then

1399.98 --> 1406.039
after it goes down it's like Ugh the

1403.64 --> 1408.44
energy it just the amount of energy just

1406.039 --> 1410.419
like decreases a little and then it

1408.44 --> 1412.5800000000002
doesn't it doesn't sit like on the front

1410.419 --> 1415.039
of your nerves as much

1412.58 --> 1416.6699999999998
after the the moon has been full and

1415.039 --> 1417.919
this waiting again

1416.67 --> 1420.6200000000001
[Music]

1417.919 --> 1423.46
right now what the blood moon or

1420.62 --> 1423.4599999999998
whatever I don't

1423.98 --> 1429.919
I've never like witnessed a Blood Moon

1426.82 --> 1432.1589999999999
where I had the impression like oh

1429.919 --> 1434.6000000000001
there's something really weird

1432.159 --> 1437.72
energy-wise coming off that or something

1434.6 --> 1440.539
no no it's just like oh it's red

1437.72 --> 1444.64
okay that's kind of weird

1440.539 --> 1444.64
but no different energy

1450.38 --> 1455.24
maybe you guys have experienced

1452.419 --> 1458.0590000000002
something different like that

1455.24 --> 1459.64
but do not forget that it can also be

1458.059 --> 1464.059
the mind

1459.64 --> 1466.2800000000002
that might be projecting feelings onto

1464.059 --> 1468.9189999999999
it because of what you think the blood

1466.28 --> 1471.62
moon might symbolize or stand for right

1468.919 --> 1474.159
but that would be an insertion by your

1471.62 --> 1474.1589999999999
intellect

1476.059 --> 1481.1589999999999
and not the type of

1478.28 --> 1483.7
empathy reading of energy that I'm

1481.159 --> 1483.7
talking about

1487.4 --> 1493.179
50 oh so it's still in the night okay

1506.72 --> 1515.24
it looks it look like a tiny light the

1511.22 --> 1515.24
top of the moon what

1515.96 --> 1521.3600000000001
what are you talking about I

1518.659 --> 1524.96
your description does not

1521.36 --> 1526.9399999999998
match with what I understand to be a

1524.96 --> 1530.2
Blood Moon situation what are you

1526.94 --> 1530.2
talking about flatus h

1532.52 --> 1538.179
a little tiny light at the top of the

1535.34 --> 1538.1789999999999

Pro vax

2304.96 --> 2308.92
and they're now just like oh oh yeah it

2307.48 --> 2312.42
was all wrong oh we were just

2308.92 --> 2312.42
misinformed really

2312.52 --> 2318.099
we didn't have any secret deals for huge

2316.119 --> 2320.32
sums of cash

2318.099 --> 2323.46

2353.92 --> 2356.82
wow

2357.7 --> 2363.2799999999997
so okay well flutter say that kind of

2361.42 --> 2365.859
matters doesn't it

2363.28 --> 2368.44
I mean if they literally came into

2365.859 --> 2370.2999999999997
existence through vaccination promotion

2368.44 --> 2371.98
funds

2370.3 --> 2374.8590000000004
and now they're saying oh there's

2371.98 --> 2377.8
politicians they made us do it they made

2374.859 --> 2379.18
us take that money to promote this to

2377.8 --> 2382.0600000000004
promote this

2379.18 --> 2383.6189999999997
shot to people that literally we had no

data of

2383.619 --> 2388.599
yes

2385.9 --> 2393.2200000000003
of course your hands are clean it's not

2388.599 --> 2395.079
like you took money to promote

2393.22 --> 2397.9599999999996
something that you didn't know anything

2395.079 --> 2399.94
about which was highly suspicious by

2399.94 --> 2402.64
without anybody knowing anything about

2401.8 --> 2405.2200000000003
it

2402.64 --> 2409.54
I mean that's that's not your fault

2405.22 --> 2412.68
right for taking money to promote that

2409.54 --> 2412.68
in Media

2413.14 --> 2418.2599999999998
yeah I think

2415.119 --> 2418.26
I think it is

2418.78 --> 2424.7400000000002
think you're gonna have to

2421.06 --> 2424.74
face the consequences for that

hell are you doing you insane idiot

2470.32 --> 2473.8590000000004
worth it

2472.42 --> 2477.2200000000003
to even

2473.859 --> 2480.64
ask a question like that is

2477.22 --> 2483.52
is an atrocity is it worth it

2480.64 --> 2485.859
what did it ever do for you what was it

2483.52 --> 2488.859
ever claimed to be able to do for you

you [ __ ] idiot

2488.859 --> 2493.5989999999997
oh oh nothing nothing because the

2493.599 --> 2498.4
didn't even do anything relating to the

supposed situation

yeah

2500.02 --> 2505.2599999999998
you're [ __ ] out of your mind triple

2502.9 --> 2505.26
facts

2505.72 --> 2508.3799999999997
what have you done

2509.56 --> 2513.82
are lucky to even be alive to tell about

2511.96 --> 2520.94
it for now

2529.3 --> 2534.3
okay only lonely

2531.64 --> 2534.2999999999997
sure

2535.96 --> 2539.04
hey Rob l

2551.92 --> 2558.359
that's great was a wasn't in 2020 2021

2556.0 --> 2558.359
yeah

2558.64 --> 2562.44
well it kind of was actually

2563.44 --> 2567.64
Robel

2564.76 --> 2569.7400000000002
it was as soon as the vaccination got

2567.64 --> 2572.02
introduced the death rate started

2569.74 --> 2575.9199999999996
climbing immediately

2572.02 --> 2578.44
but yeah a lot of it is delayed I mean

2575.92 --> 2581.26
it's not like you take the shot and you

2578.44 --> 2583.7200000000003
immediately drop dead every single time

2581.26 --> 2585.76
sometimes there's like a rough average

2583.72 --> 2588.7
five-year delay

2585.76 --> 2593.28
but if you continue getting jabbed then

2588.7 --> 2596.56
that significantly decreases that margin

2593.28 --> 2598.96
so that extra time you have on average

2596.56 --> 2601.56
before you die from it

2598.96 --> 2605.4
so yeah it's not surprising that since

2601.56 --> 2607.48
some people have just been like

2605.4 --> 2609.78
permafaxers that they're just like no

2607.48 --> 2612.7
I'll take whatever the [ __ ] they say

2609.78 --> 2614.8590000000004
every every year

2612.7 --> 2617.14
doesn't matter what's in it yeah well

2614.859 --> 2619.48
guess what

2617.14 --> 2621.0989999999997
not surprising that after one two years

2619.48 --> 2622.78
suddenly

2621.099 --> 2625.7200000000003
big

2622.78 --> 2628.1800000000003
ger growing death Spike it's because of

2625.72 --> 2630.9599999999996

lonely

2791.44 --> 2797.98
[Music]

2794.26 --> 2800.44
calling GB news mainstream media well

2797.98 --> 2804.7
yeah it's kind of silly but to be fair

2800.44 --> 2808.66
though only lonely the format is very

2804.7 --> 2811.72
cookie cutter mainstream media format

2808.66 --> 2813.8799999999997
am I right it looks exactly like any

2811.72 --> 2814.9599999999996
stupid standard news

2813.88 --> 2816.339
thing

2814.96 --> 2819.16
so

2816.339 --> 2820.96
I mean I don't blame D marble for

2819.16 --> 2825.24
calling that mainstream media because it

2820.96 --> 2825.2400000000002
looks exactly like mainstream media

2825.88 --> 2835.4100000000003
right

2827.07 --> 2835.4100000000003
[Music]

2856.48 --> 2862.9
I find that such an art saying only

2860.02 --> 2865.48
lonely never judge a book by its covers

2862.9 --> 2867.94
it's like oh it's a classic it's like oh

2865.48 --> 2869.38
that's what Grandpa even said

2867.94 --> 2870.94
well

2869.38 --> 2872.1400000000003
why not

2870.94 --> 2875.619
I mean

2872.14 --> 2879.54
doesn't the cover of a book actually say

2875.619 --> 2879.54
a lot about the nature of the book

2880.06 --> 2882.7799999999997
I mean

2884.2 --> 2891.52
some books have just like oh just a very

2889.66 --> 2894.7
boring cover

2891.52 --> 2896.14
or just like oh a color print just one

2894.7 --> 2898.4199999999996
basic thing you know it's going to wear

2896.14 --> 2899.7999999999997
over time some have like really classic

2898.42 --> 2902.859
made

2899.8 --> 2905.98
uh with uh

2902.859 --> 2908.7999999999997
with fabrics and all that well yeah if I

2905.98 --> 2911.5
see a book with like carefully crafted

2908.8 --> 2914.98
fabric cover I'm gonna be like hmm

2911.5 --> 2918.4
somebody made a lot of effort

2914.98 --> 2921.3
for that book which to me will mean that

2918.4 --> 2921.3
it's probably

2921.359 --> 2929.38
perceived as above just dumb [ __ ]

2926.38 --> 2931.1800000000003
so I do actually judge a book by its

2929.38 --> 2933.88
covers

2931.18 --> 2936.04
just not exclusively but it's always a

2933.88 --> 2938.859
good first hint

2936.04 --> 2941.7
so and I get reminded every time I see

2938.859 --> 2941.7
somebody say that

2951.16 --> 2953.64
anyway

2958.59 --> 2964.44
[Music]

2961.54 --> 2964.44
come on

2964.66 --> 2969.46
now I get

2966.76 --> 2971.079
if that channel

2969.46 --> 2974.38
did that

2971.079 --> 2976.0600000000004
to look like super standard mainstream

2974.38 --> 2978.94
media format

2976.06 --> 2981.339
to be taken more serious well

2978.94 --> 2984.819
that sentence right

2981.339 --> 2987.52
has implication why

2984.819 --> 2990.04
well what type of people are actually

2987.52 --> 2990.94
going to take that serious because guess

2990.04 --> 2994.06
what

2990.94 --> 2996.04
there's now people

2994.06 --> 2999.16
that haven't watched it for like 10

2996.04 --> 3002.339
years and as soon as they see any kind

2999.16 --> 3005.54
of standard mainstream media

3002.339 --> 3009.42
presentation on a video the immediate

3005.54 --> 3012.18
immediately put it down the [ __ ]

3009.42 --> 3014.839
why because that's mainstream media

3012.18 --> 3014.839
that's poison

3016.26 --> 3020.579
so

3017.88 --> 3023.42
yeah so they're not aiming for the

3020.579 --> 3027.1800000000003
already awoken people

3023.42 --> 3029.64
you must be able to realize that

3027.18 --> 3032.52
does the already awoken people

3029.64 --> 3034.859
they don't like mainstream media format

3032.52 --> 3036.9
they're not gonna take it more serious

3034.859 --> 3040.74
because a mainstream media format

3036.9 --> 3042.839
they're going to be repulsed by it

3040.74 --> 3044.5789999999997
so what are they aiming for

3042.839 --> 3048.72
the public

3044.579 --> 3051.6600000000003
that hasn't done that that has been

3048.72 --> 3054.7799999999997
mainstream media dependent

3051.66 --> 3057.7799999999997
and that they hope is going to oh maybe

3054.78 --> 3060.119
we want a mainstream media that doesn't

3057.78 --> 3062.1600000000003
just blatantly lie to us and tell us

3060.119 --> 3064.51
that kill yourselves

3062.16 --> 3066.5989999999997
like those people yeah

3064.51 --> 3069.3
[Music]

3066.599 --> 3072.059
that's what they're aiming for then

3069.3 --> 3073.7400000000002
because who the hell in their right mind

3072.059 --> 3077.1600000000003
really

3073.74 --> 3079.9199999999996
would watch some video have it look

3077.16 --> 3085.02
exactly like mainstream media and then

3079.92 --> 3088.2000000000003
oh well that means it's real then

3085.02 --> 3092.04
I mean are there even people still alive

3088.2 --> 3094.3999999999996
like that haven't they all died

3092.04 --> 3097.44
from taking faxes

3094.4 --> 3101.599
recommended to them by these mainstream

3097.44 --> 3101.599
media format media companies

3102.48 --> 3105.14
foreign

3137.16 --> 3144.0
Nigel farage is involved in it

3141.24 --> 3147.2999999999997
so it is that one

3144.0 --> 3150.839
wow they've gone worse

3147.3 --> 3153.3
they've totally standardized because I

3150.839 --> 3157.0789999999997
watched GB news

3153.3 --> 3159.0
a while back when with with Nigel farage

3157.079 --> 3161.2200000000003
and it wasn't like that

3159.0 --> 3165.359
it was much more it looked much more

3161.22 --> 3167.339
like the old Alex Jones Show format

3165.359 --> 3168.72
and I actually I watched a few of that

3167.339 --> 3172.859
it was pretty good

3168.72 --> 3176.16
however I have actually

3172.859 --> 3179.4
read some things about it mainly that it

3176.16 --> 3182.0589999999997
is not actually an independent Network

3179.4 --> 3186.059
but it that it absolutely

3182.059 --> 3188.4
gets Government funding

3186.059 --> 3190.6800000000003
yeah

3188.4 --> 3193.14
it's not actually an independent media

3190.68 --> 3197.339
organization it's a government media

3193.14 --> 3200.2999999999997
organization or to be more precise what

3197.339 --> 3204.0
is very much looking like a controlled

3200.3 --> 3209.6400000000003
opposition media operation

3204.0 --> 3213.119
to their BBC tyrannical system

3209.64 --> 3215.5789999999997
that's what GB news seems to be becoming

3213.119 --> 3218.04
more and more

3215.579 --> 3221.7000000000003
but they are not independent they're

3218.04 --> 3224.54
actually government money funded

3221.7 --> 3224.54
did you know that

3228.48 --> 3232.44
I bet you didn't

3230.4 --> 3234.059
that's kind of why I wasn't inquiring in

3232.44 --> 3235.98
the first place I just didn't recognize

3234.059 --> 3238.3390000000004
them because they've changed the way

3235.98 --> 3238.339
they look

3238.68 --> 3242.0
in a bad way

3246.13 --> 3258.65
[Music]

3261.48 --> 3266.579
you don't think yeah they do

3264.66 --> 3269.0989999999997
they've been proven

3266.579 --> 3272.7200000000003
to take government funding

3269.099 --> 3272.7200000000003
even if in its setup

3275.22 --> 3280.5
they are

3277.68 --> 3282.8999999999996
they have government funding it it

3280.5 --> 3286.04
doesn't matter that you don't think they

3282.9 --> 3286.04
don't they do

3293.22 --> 3301.339
or damn it maybe it was another one [ __ ]

3296.52 --> 3301.339
I'm not sure now I'm not sure anymore

3301.819 --> 3305.7
I mean are there any other media groups

3304.74 --> 3307.68
out there

3305.7 --> 3309.839
because I recognized as soon as you

3307.68 --> 3313.22
mentioned Nigel farage because

3309.839 --> 3313.22
he was kind of the one

3313.46 --> 3318.98
that was on that or that I was watching

3316.5 --> 3318.98
at the time

3322.2 --> 3326.96
but is it GB news or isn't it oh you

3324.839 --> 3329.2799999999997
can't find any stuff on it

hey hello by the way classical homeopath

4337.699 --> 4341.96
good to see you

4340.219 --> 4343.28
and yes they'll look up the other

4341.96 --> 4346.6
meanings

4343.28 --> 4346.599999999999
might make you squirt

4348.72 --> 4355.1
[Music]

4356.739 --> 4362.419999999999
yeah that's correct that's exactly

4358.94 --> 4364.94
correct I don't okay abbreviations yeah

4362.42 --> 4366.679
I call them shorts It's just shortening

4364.94 --> 4369.5
it up because that's exactly what it

4366.679 --> 4373.219
does and that's why people do it

4369.5 --> 4376.239
but yeah I hate them I hate all of them

4373.219 --> 4376.2390000000005
all of them

4377.48 --> 4383.78
there's there's basically only one

4380.48 --> 4387.259999999999
abbreviation that I use and that's lull

4383.78 --> 4389.78
and that's from my old nerd days

4387.26 --> 4391.46
but that has like a double meaning to me

4389.78 --> 4395.84
because LOL

4391.46 --> 4397.78
in Dutch literally means

4395.84 --> 4401.3
fun

4397.78 --> 4403.94
yeah so I actually have a sneaky reason

4401.3 --> 4405.4400000000005
to use it because it's also not an

4403.94 --> 4408.678999999999
abbreviation

4405.44 --> 4411.799999999999
I just never use abbreviations I [ __ ]

4408.679 --> 4413.14
hate them I I really hate them

4411.8 --> 4416.42
because it makes everything

4413.14 --> 4418.04
misunderstood everything and then people

4416.42 --> 4420.38
think they understand what it is and

4418.04 --> 4422.239
then they put it in their mind the way

4420.38 --> 4424.159000000001
they understand it and then it's

4422.239 --> 4426.62
completely something different from what

4424.159 --> 4428.96
they thought and then people just [ __ ]

4426.62 --> 4432.679
up their memories using these stupid

4428.96 --> 4435.14
abbreviations never use them

4432.679 --> 4438.82
never

4435.14 --> 4438.820000000001
makes people [ __ ]

4439.1 --> 4442.1
anyway

4447.92 --> 4452.719
maybe it's just works better in Hindi or

4450.86 --> 4455.9
something I don't know

4452.719 --> 4458.38
it doesn't work well in English it

4455.9 --> 4458.379999999999
really doesn't

4463.64 --> 4466.84
hey steemit Traveler

4472.219 --> 4479.0
something like PP would be an initialism

4476.0 --> 4481.4
right well yeah well if somebody says

4479.0 --> 4484.36
capital letter P P I do understand that

4481.4 --> 4484.36
they mean PayPal

4484.94 --> 4490.159
because there's pretty much no other way

4487.82 --> 4491.9
that could be logic yeah that it would

4490.159 --> 4493.879999999999
be logically interpreted so that's like

4491.9 --> 4496.4
the only thing that where I would allow

4493.88 --> 4498.92
it well why because you're literally

4496.4 --> 4501.739
paying me money that's when I allow you

4498.92 --> 4504.02
to use that so yeah you can abbreviate

4501.739 --> 4507.159
PayPal if you want

4504.02 --> 4507.159000000001
that's about it

4513.76 --> 4520.1
LOL but I not don't even say low I mean

4517.64 --> 4522.14
I say low because I'm Dutch and because

4520.1 --> 4524.0
I'm Dutch you can say low because it

4522.14 --> 4526.280000000001
doesn't have to be an abbreviation if

4524.0 --> 4529.1
you're not Dutch then you can't use that

4526.28 --> 4531.259999999999
or you will be using an abbreviation

4529.1 --> 4533.659000000001
now people still do it and I don't

4531.26 --> 4535.6990000000005
really care too much it's just

4533.659 --> 4538.46
I mean it's pretty clear what that means

4535.699 --> 4540.86
see there's very little interpretation

4538.46 --> 4544.159
room for it

4540.86 --> 4546.32
but if it's not like a a thing that's

4544.159 --> 4549.199
already been used for 30 years right

4546.32 --> 4551.299999999999
every single person in the world then

4549.199 --> 4554.0199999999995
please don't do it

4551.3 --> 4554.02
just don't

4563.12 --> 4568.64
yeah Terry did use yeah and indeed and

4566.84 --> 4570.9800000000005
if you didn't mean profile picture it's

4568.64 --> 4573.26
[ __ ] annoying because I think hey

4570.98 --> 4576.0199999999995
you're talking about PayPal

4573.26 --> 4578.84
but he isn't

4576.02 --> 4581.780000000001
so don't do that just don't use these

4578.84 --> 4585.26
abbreviations unless it's like

4581.78 --> 4587.54
very clear what you're talking about

4585.26 --> 4592.6990000000005
like hey Arwin

4587.54 --> 4595.34
uh check your PP well I'm I'm pretty

4592.699 --> 4598.36
sure you don't mean profile picture when

4595.34 --> 4598.360000000001
you say that you see

4599.78 --> 4605.599999999999
I'm pretty sure you're gonna mean PayPal

4602.3 --> 4607.52
especially if you are a person that is

4605.6 --> 4609.14
known to actually send me PayPal

4607.52 --> 4611.96
donations

4609.14 --> 4615.58
right so

4611.96 --> 4615.58
just in context

4618.88 --> 4625.52
yeah whatever man only lonely I know

4622.699 --> 4627.799999999999
what you mean but that's what people say

4625.52 --> 4630.320000000001
that's what they say in the chat

4627.8 --> 4633.5
I'm sorry that's why I don't that's why

4630.32 --> 4635.599999999999
I just when I see check your PP I just

4633.5 --> 4638.44
say oh check your PayPal because I know

4635.6 --> 4638.4400000000005
that's what it means

4639.679 --> 4644.62
dude get the [ __ ] out of here let's go

4653.92 --> 4663.46
yes steamy traveler so yeah that would

4658.1 --> 4663.46
be great if you then just spell it out

4663.739 --> 4668.959999999999
that would be great thanks thanks a lot

4666.08 --> 4672.62
for that thanks [ __ ] a bunch steamy

4668.96 --> 4674.719
traveler and guys oh it's so funny so

4672.62 --> 4677.179
[ __ ] funny that you could also see it

4674.719 --> 4680.36
the other way oh thanks

4677.179 --> 4682.58
for emphasizing even more how [ __ ]

4680.36 --> 4686.679
much I hate

4682.58 --> 4686.679
people using that

4688.96 --> 4694.96
abbreviations yeah

4691.64 --> 4694.96
you're not helping me

4697.58 --> 4702.26
it's on the abbreviations you use in

4699.679 --> 4706.46
your speech would be BS

4702.26 --> 4709.1
well if you fill that up with a proper

4706.46 --> 4712.04
sentence then yeah I might even

4709.1 --> 4715.64
recognize BS as being [ __ ]

4712.04 --> 4716.96
because that is typically in your lingo

4715.64 --> 4718.88
right

4716.96 --> 4720.28
but if you're like hey did you check

4718.88 --> 4724.219
your

4720.28 --> 4726.92
TF then like what the [ __ ] are you

4724.219 --> 4730.4800000000005
saying right because how the hell would

4726.92 --> 4730.4800000000005
I know what the hell you're saying then

4731.3 --> 4737.4800000000005
right if you're gonna say huh

4735.14 --> 4740.84
this idiot doesn't know what he's

4737.48 --> 4742.239
talking about he's constantly talking BS

4740.84 --> 4746.06
well

4742.239 --> 4748.879999999999
yeah I mean the context already been put

4746.06 --> 4751.64
down so then it's like very hard to

4748.88 --> 4753.38
interpret it another way if it's just

4751.64 --> 4756.320000000001
like

4753.38 --> 4758.3
yeah this is TP or something then how

4756.32 --> 4759.98
the [ __ ] are you gonna recognize what

4758.3 --> 4762.6990000000005
you're talking about

4759.98 --> 4762.699
see

4763.88 --> 4770.5
tried to say [ __ ] well look territ

4767.659 --> 4770.5
as I said

4770.84 --> 4778.88
you can say BS but you gotta realize

4774.98 --> 4783.0199999999995
that you have to then fill out the

4778.88 --> 4786.14
proper preparing context you see

4783.02 --> 4788.900000000001
so that it is not hard to see that it

4786.14 --> 4790.820000000001
actually does mean that word

4788.9 --> 4793.639999999999
that's the point

4790.82 --> 4795.5599999999995
don't just put an acronym there and then

4793.64 --> 4797.3
expect everybody to understand what the

4795.56 --> 4800.120000000001
hell you're talking about you got it

4797.3 --> 4803.78
first fill it in

4800.12 --> 4807.0199999999995
Gotta Give a context to what that is

4803.78 --> 4808.5199999999995
going to mean that's how it works that's

4807.02 --> 4810.14
how you should do it

4808.52 --> 4812.4800000000005
if you do it properly

4810.14 --> 4814.34
then nobody's going to be disturbed by

4812.48 --> 4815.839999999999
your by your

4814.34 --> 4817.46
[ __ ] I keep forgetting the names

4815.84 --> 4820.219
that's why I just call it shorts because

4817.46 --> 4824.08
I keep forgetting the name

4820.219 --> 4827.38
the word freaking hell uh

4824.08 --> 4827.38
acronyms was it

4829.52 --> 4833.26
damn it let's go

4842.86 --> 4846.98
abbreviation God damn it

4845.659 --> 4849.32
that word

4846.98 --> 4851.86
so this is why I just call them short

4849.32 --> 4851.86
anyway

4854.84 --> 4860.54
right good glad to hear it there at 306

4857.42 --> 4863.9
I mean I'm not telling you never do that

4860.54 --> 4866.9
again never use them right I mean it's

4863.9 --> 4870.46
your life it's just that in my chat

4866.9 --> 4870.46
it's kind of confusing

4870.92 --> 4875.6
right I'm not saying like it's bad for

4873.199 --> 4877.639999999999
your life if you do that but you got to

4875.6 --> 4878.780000000001
realize that you gotta give proper

4877.64 --> 4882.860000000001
context

4878.78 --> 4885.08
in order to actually understand those

4882.86 --> 4886.88
properly because if you just put the

4885.08 --> 4889.76
short word the short letters there then

4886.88 --> 4891.92
it's like what the [ __ ] does it mean

4889.76 --> 4893.54
right now if you're used to using that

4891.92 --> 4895.46
because you're like going back and forth

4893.54 --> 4898.76
with somebody and having already

4895.46 --> 4900.92
mentioned it like 50 times in a day then

4898.76 --> 4902.3
I get it if you just want to use the

4900.92 --> 4905.179
short for it

4902.3 --> 4908.3
but if you just uh hi hello did you know

4905.179 --> 4910.1
this for the first time or whatever then

4908.3 --> 4911.4800000000005
you shouldn't expect that people will

4910.1 --> 4914.620000000001
just understand what the hell you're

4911.48 --> 4918.44
talking about right anyway sorry for
