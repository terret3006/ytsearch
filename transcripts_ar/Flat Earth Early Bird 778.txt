wow

170.48 --> 178.07999999999998

anyway

181.36 --> 184.959
thanks for sharing that here we go again

183.519 --> 186.959
i didn't notice that

184.959 --> 188.72
i only pay attention if the sound is

186.959 --> 190.879
symmetrical

188.72 --> 192.72
because that one goes off suddenly all

190.879 --> 194.07999999999998
of all of a sudden every now and then

192.72 --> 197.35999999999999
but i did notice that

194.08 --> 200.31900000000002
my volume was really low

197.36 --> 201.59900000000002
so yeah thanks here we go again who was

200.319 --> 204.79999999999998
first in chat

201.599 --> 204.79999999999998

so how is everybody doing i'm doing okay

232.879 --> 235.28
today

236.56 --> 241.84
i had an interesting evening yesterday

243.24 --> 248.0
[Music]

245.2 --> 248.48
yeah besides the flat earth debate which

248.0 --> 250.799
was

248.48 --> 253.2
pretty good although i wasn't present

250.799 --> 256.639
during the whole thing

253.2 --> 259.919
uh let's see what else

256.639 --> 260.56
yeah yeah uh yeah i kind of like joined

259.919 --> 263.84
in the chat

260.56 --> 263.84
uh with geranism

263.919 --> 270.0
when david knight was on and this um

267.6 --> 271.91900000000004
nick guy i thought it was called alex

270.0 --> 275.44
sting

271.919 --> 278.15999999999997
but renamed this nick and yeah it was

275.44 --> 281.199
kind of interesting sitting through that

278.16 --> 284.96000000000004
and at first i got some like

281.199 --> 287.36
who's this the real arwen in the chat

284.96 --> 288.56
but yeah once i identified myself

287.36 --> 290.88
properly

288.56 --> 292.4
i don't know they they tolerated me in

290.88 --> 297.84
there

292.4 --> 297.84
and yeah i actually had a bit of fun

302.56 --> 305.68
hey george sanford

306.4 --> 312.32
fed up off lockdown

310.0 --> 312.32
what

314.32 --> 317.84
what does that mean here we go again

322.08 --> 329.35999999999996
right so yeah didn't make any map

325.919 --> 330.71999999999997
real yes still don't know what that

329.36 --> 339.84000000000003
means even if it's

330.72 --> 339.84000000000003
one f in the off

344.639 --> 351.68
oh you mean you are fed up

347.759 --> 355.039
with the lockdown it's not fed up off

351.68 --> 355.039
that's not proper english

358.16 --> 366.319
feta from fed up off is not

361.52 --> 370.479
english right yeah that's

366.319 --> 370.47900000000004
whatever you're supposed to be english

371.919 --> 374.4
oh well

379.44 --> 383.44
right so lockdown is it is it still bad

382.24 --> 386.0
over there

383.44 --> 390.08
in england over here not so much and

386.0 --> 390.08
there's some weird situations going on

391.84 --> 395.84
i i really wonder

396.319 --> 400.56
what's gonna happen today in the

398.0 --> 400.56
netherlands

402.4 --> 406.23999999999995
all these articles are saying that it's

404.16 --> 409.44
basically yeah that

406.24 --> 412.88
the dutch government is sort of over

409.44 --> 415.12
today there's something's gonna happen

412.88 --> 416.0
but with how things have been going

415.12 --> 419.199
recently

416.0 --> 421.68
in politics and media in general

419.199 --> 422.8
i'm very pessimistic of pretty much

421.68 --> 424.479
everything

422.8 --> 426.16
you know there's so much happening but

424.479 --> 428.0
i'm really

426.16 --> 429.44
i don't want to be fooled again by this

428.0 --> 432.72
[ __ ]

429.44 --> 432.71999999999997
because it's when

433.12 --> 438.0
massive letdowns happen in general

435.599 --> 440.56
there's a lot of demoralization

438.0 --> 441.199
and when they do it that is exactly what

440.56 --> 443.599
they want

441.199 --> 445.759
out of it and that's why i've just

443.599 --> 448.24
retracted

445.759 --> 450.40000000000003
i'm trying to retract because i just i'm

448.24 --> 453.919
not going to believe anything until it's

450.4 --> 456.56
done until it's done

453.919 --> 457.599
because there's so many false hope

456.56 --> 460.88
claims and all that

457.599 --> 462.319
it's just and maybe it's not false hope

460.88 --> 464.4
but the problem is is that

462.319 --> 465.599
because of the tension you get so tied

464.4 --> 468.87899999999996
up into that

465.599 --> 468.87899999999996
and that's the bad part

469.12 --> 479.84000000000003
at least for me it's very draining

482.639 --> 495.68
yeah yeah jared sanford i know

492.879 --> 495.68
i saw that

496.56 --> 499.599
like in norway

499.919 --> 506.0
all these people had wrote yeah the

503.039 --> 507.12
corona vaccine and like huge amount of

506.0 --> 510.4
people died yet

507.12 --> 514.0
it's it's all

510.4 --> 516.56
it is what it is it's part of the

514.0 --> 516.56
program

519.599 --> 523.44
it's just gonna keep on shoving it in

522.0 --> 525.44
your face

523.44 --> 526.48
and still people are gonna do it it's

525.44 --> 535.839
like as

526.48 --> 535.839
people are just gonna do it

546.839 --> 549.839
ugh

562.56 --> 566.64
all right anyway i got kind of caught up

564.56 --> 571.8389999999999
watching some

566.64 --> 571.8389999999999
alex jones interview with steve jenning

572.16 --> 581.36
i think it was from yesterday no i'm not

576.56 --> 581.3599999999999
entirely sure about it let me recheck it

582.8 --> 587.1999999999999
if i can if i can find it back

587.839 --> 591.839
hold on

596.0 --> 602.16
no wait it's not yes it's like wait is

599.44 --> 602.1600000000001
it december

602.839 --> 605.839
10th

606.959 --> 615.5189999999999
right it is december 10. yeah so that

611.12 --> 617.6
would make it old free situation

615.519 --> 619.2
i was wondering about it because it's it

617.6 --> 621.279
seemed still very much

619.2 --> 622.24
like yeah yeah it's these things are

621.279 --> 633.8389999999999
gonna happen this

622.24 --> 633.839
is gonna happen

635.839 --> 640.8800000000001
but yeah as i said even like even as the

638.8 --> 642.16
situation with the capital and all that

640.88 --> 645.2
happened

642.16 --> 647.04
and everything after the attitudes what

645.2 --> 650.32
is being said

647.04 --> 652.399
like i don't know man it could be like

650.32 --> 655.9200000000001
this really

652.399 --> 655.92
last minute switch

656.16 --> 659.36
where it's like no wait we're gonna

658.64 --> 663.1999999999999
arrest them

659.36 --> 665.44
in the like while during coronation like

663.2 --> 667.0400000000001
to be make it extra dramatic or

665.44 --> 671.0400000000001
something

667.04 --> 671.04
you never really know with these people

672.839 --> 678.8000000000001
uh

675.76 --> 681.279
i'm just trying to retract from it as

678.8 --> 688.56
much as i can

681.279 --> 690.8
it's just all very frustrating

688.56 --> 690.8
right

692.88 --> 699.92
yes here we go again yeah we know

697.04 --> 701.76
i think everybody pretty much has

699.92 --> 703.8389999999999
figured it out that it doesn't really

701.76 --> 703.8389999999999
like

706.64 --> 710.0
nobody even questions whether it is

708.959 --> 711.92
effective

710.0 --> 713.92
the supposed corona measures and the

711.92 --> 715.36
lockdowns and the masks if it is

713.92 --> 718.959
effective anymore

715.36 --> 722.399
because we're just being told to do it

718.959 --> 724.7199999999999
and it's kind of being enforced through

722.399 --> 726.8
corporations or people within

724.72 --> 727.839
corporations that have that power to do

726.8 --> 729.92
that

727.839 --> 731.6800000000001
and the people don't yeah we don't

729.92 --> 732.639
really have a grip on the situation

731.68 --> 734.399
anymore

732.639 --> 737.04
so i think that the general public is

734.399 --> 738.959
just not even

737.04 --> 740.3199999999999
they don't even care anymore whether

738.959 --> 741.76
it's real or not

740.32 --> 743.36
because they're being forced to do it

741.76 --> 744.16
anyway and i think a whole bunch of

743.36 --> 747.519
people

744.16 --> 749.68
are realizing that so we're all just

747.519 --> 751.36
caught up in this virtual game

749.68 --> 759.8389999999999
and even though you know it's kind of

751.36 --> 759.839
fake it's still happening

764.72 --> 769.519
and everybody i think also is trying to

766.8 --> 772.959
like touch around and see like how far

769.519 --> 776.079
can you go in

772.959 --> 777.1999999999999
not cooperating with it and how does it

776.079 --> 779.12
work and when

777.2 --> 781.279
are you actually going to be targeted

779.12 --> 784.32
and yeah it's just

781.279 --> 787.12
it's like a new playboard

784.32 --> 788.32
everybody's figuring out the rules the

787.12 --> 801.839
actual rules not

788.32 --> 801.839
the apparent rules

812.839 --> 815.839
so

819.76 --> 824.639
so anything else on your mind except

822.32 --> 827.839
corona [ __ ]

824.639 --> 829.519
or is that all you do yeah you look into

827.839 --> 832.639
now is that all you can think about

829.519 --> 835.199
is that the only thing left because

832.639 --> 837.6
i don't even really think about it

835.199 --> 837.5999999999999
anymore

837.76 --> 842.639
i just try to get around not wearing a

841.279 --> 846.399
mask as much as i can

842.639 --> 846.399
and i'm being respected for that

849.12 --> 857.68
because people are not afraid of corona

854.399 --> 861.36
like really they are not very few

857.68 --> 864.3199999999999
are and it's mostly people that

861.36 --> 865.839
are just suffering from anxiety in

864.32 --> 867.9200000000001
general

865.839 --> 870.24
and then their mind makes it about

867.92 --> 872.0
corona perhaps

870.24 --> 873.36
but it's not really about corona it's

872.0 --> 877.199
about that they are

873.36 --> 880.88
in anxiety from everything and from

877.199 --> 880.88
their own life and from whatever

882.24 --> 886.9590000000001
and so because corona things are out

885.04 --> 890.399
there and in your face

886.959 --> 892.399
their anxiety makes them latch onto that

890.399 --> 894.079
as a focus because they don't have that

892.399 --> 895.44
much control they're just looking for

894.079 --> 897.68
some kind of way

895.44 --> 899.9200000000001
out of the anxiety something to distract

897.68 --> 902.2399999999999
them they'll grip them

899.92 --> 903.36
grip a lot of their attention away from

902.24 --> 905.519
it

903.36 --> 907.6
and yeah because it's being dangled in

905.519 --> 910.9590000000001
their face constantly everywhere

907.6 --> 914.72
through media through just life

910.959 --> 915.76
social life yeah that's what they latch

914.72 --> 919.44
on to it's a

915.76 --> 919.4399999999999
basic conditioning process

925.519 --> 929.36
and it is mind control by the way

932.399 --> 936.639
but it's only if you're anxious

936.959 --> 943.04
if you're not in control

940.079 --> 944.4799999999999
of yourself because if you're not then

943.04 --> 947.519
you can just

944.48 --> 949.279
gradually figure out what it is how to

947.519 --> 951.839
deal with things and

949.279 --> 954.24
it's very important that you just know

951.839 --> 956.9590000000001
how to compose yourself in general

954.24 --> 958.48
it has always been important of course

956.959 --> 962.2399999999999
just

958.48 --> 965.12
to keep social order for yourself and

962.24 --> 966.639
know who you are in relation to other

965.12 --> 971.519
people huh

966.639 --> 974.639
right but now it's even more important

971.519 --> 977.04
because so many people suffer of

974.639 --> 979.839
anxiety and then get caught up in these

977.04 --> 982.0
things and you have to be careful

979.839 --> 984.72
of not getting caught up with them in a

982.0 --> 984.72
situation

989.86 --> 992.94
[Music]

994.079 --> 1011.8389999999999
oh god aries 106 come on

1016.88 --> 1020.639
they just want their holidays

1021.04 --> 1027.9189999999999
free money and sit at home

1024.64 --> 1029.8390000000002
well i'm wondering sometimes about that

1027.919 --> 1032.4
like are there really people that want

1029.839 --> 1032.3999999999999
just that

1035.76 --> 1042.64
george sanford you really think so

1041.039 --> 1053.84
wouldn't people just get bored out of

1042.64 --> 1053.8400000000001
their minds

1054.559 --> 1059.44
maybe yeah maybe on the short run that's

1056.559 --> 1062.799
what people want

1059.44 --> 1065.52
but the problem is that they probably

1062.799 --> 1066.559
settle for really shitty jobs with no

1065.52 --> 1068.4
outlook

1066.559 --> 1070.72
and then you're just desperate for a

1068.4 --> 1071.44
good break but they don't realize that

1070.72 --> 1075.28
this if

1071.44 --> 1077.52
if you consider this as a break yeah

1075.28 --> 1079.52
you don't have that same freedom as you

1077.52 --> 1081.28
would if you would had taken a break

1079.52 --> 1082.799
during the job in the normal days

1081.28 --> 1085.36
without corona

1082.799 --> 1087.36
because of lockdown situations and it

1085.36 --> 1088.559
constantly being shoved in your face

1087.36 --> 1092.24
everywhere

1088.559 --> 1092.24
right so

1092.4 --> 1099.52
it's just

1095.6 --> 1102.6399999999999
not very insightful to think that

1099.52 --> 1105.52
oh you're just going to have a

1102.64 --> 1107.2800000000002
free money vacation because of corona

1105.52 --> 1108.0
sitting home no that's not what's going

1107.28 --> 1111.9189999999999
to happen at

1108.0 --> 1115.44
all you're going to get bored

1111.919 --> 1117.1200000000001
and you're going to feel trapped

1115.44 --> 1120.64
and then you're going to realize how

1117.12 --> 1123.84
shitty things have become

1120.64 --> 1123.8400000000001
less easy

1130.84 --> 1137.84
[Music]

1133.679 --> 1137.8400000000001
eat ice cream okay

1140.16 --> 1146.559
[Music]

1143.12 --> 1148.559
well george sanford they whoever they

1146.559 --> 1151.84
are in this case

1148.559 --> 1155.52
i don't know that sounds very depressing

1151.84 --> 1157.9189999999999
so don't know who they are but if

1155.52 --> 1159.6
they think that that is like a viable

1157.919 --> 1165.8400000000001
thing to do

1159.6 --> 1165.84
they're gonna find out

1177.84 --> 1179.9189999999999
you

1181.39 --> 1184.519
[Music]

1204.84 --> 1207.84
hmm

1216.799 --> 1222.24
all right aries 106. oh that's

1220.08 --> 1223.52
good on you in yeah in a way i'm in a

1222.24 --> 1225.6
similar position

1223.52 --> 1227.12
it's not like i'm rich here not

1225.6 --> 1229.84
financially secure

1227.12 --> 1231.36
although i am much more financially

1229.84 --> 1234.559
secure than i was say

1231.36 --> 1237.84
two years ago much more and

1234.559 --> 1242.1589999999999
for me the corona situation has not

1237.84 --> 1244.1589999999999
in fact affected my income at all

1242.159 --> 1245.44
if anything it's probably brought more

1244.159 --> 1248.96
attention just to

1245.44 --> 1262.96
my platform and to what i do and

1248.96 --> 1266.799
help me out

1262.96 --> 1266.799
learning to code oh wow

1267.44 --> 1270.4
is it still going

1272.08 --> 1278.559
yes it's still going thank god

1276.4 --> 1281.919
yeah my internet got disconnected but i

1278.559 --> 1281.9189999999999
noticed it just in time

1282.08 --> 1288.84
almost uh cut off the stream then i

1285.2 --> 1291.679
would have had to start up a new one

1288.84 --> 1305.84
ah

1291.679 --> 1305.8400000000001
but i'm still here

1317.919 --> 1320.159
what

1324.64 --> 1333.8400000000001
right anyway

1348.24 --> 1352.24
no i i guess i'm a bit of a blank right

1351.039 --> 1354.64
now

1352.24 --> 1357.039
i really am i don't know why this

1354.64 --> 1357.039
happens

1358.96 --> 1363.6000000000001
i guess because i kind of rushed through

1361.2 --> 1366.4
everything and

1363.6 --> 1367.28
like what i did yesterday because like

1366.4 --> 1370.0
even like the

1367.28 --> 1374.799
the talk with journalism it was

1370.0 --> 1376.32
interesting it was i just didn't make

1374.799 --> 1378.8799999999999
any elaborate notes because

1376.32 --> 1380.8799999999999
i don't know sometimes everything just

1378.88 --> 1381.3600000000001
comes back at me and then i can talk

1380.88 --> 1384.64
about it

1381.36 --> 1385.28
if i got a lot of energy but i'm not in

1384.64 --> 1389.8400000000001
a really

1385.28 --> 1389.84
high energy mode not really

1389.919 --> 1394.0800000000002
i still have spirit but it's just like

1392.24 --> 1398.24
yeah i had to just do a couple of step

1394.08 --> 1398.24
backs because of demoralized situation

1398.4 --> 1402.0
then i just grow silent because i don't

1401.36 --> 1404.1589999999999
want to add

1402.0 --> 1406.799
on i don't want to get desperate and get

1404.159 --> 1408.3200000000002
all squirting over that [ __ ]

1406.799 --> 1417.84
like there's already enough of that

1408.32 --> 1417.84
going out there

1422.559 --> 1431.84
restoring snow machines what

1439.76 --> 1445.84
problems getting parts hmm

1453.84 --> 1458.9599999999998
all right well i'm still waiting on my

1456.32 --> 1461.76
tobacco to come in

1458.96 --> 1461.76
i ordered it

1462.159 --> 1465.279
half this halfway december i think or

1464.799 --> 1468.6399999999999
was it

1465.279 --> 1471.6
a week before i'm not sure

1468.64 --> 1474.64
i could look it up but a while ago uh

1471.6 --> 1474.6399999999999
last time it took

1474.72 --> 1481.679
quite a while was it

1478.96 --> 1484.8400000000001
i think like two months i hope it's

1481.679 --> 1487.8400000000001
going to be a little bit quicker this

1484.84 --> 1487.84
time

1489.76 --> 1496.32
but yeah mail cert mail delivery from

1493.6 --> 1498.0
international international mail

1496.32 --> 1501.84
delivery certainly is taking

1498.0 --> 1501.84
a long time these days

1518.88 --> 1524.64
wow really george sanford donald then

1522.08 --> 1529.76
tripled in price

1524.64 --> 1532.64
that's crazy

1529.76 --> 1533.44
so they had to like find a new producer

1532.64 --> 1537.44
or something

1533.44 --> 1537.44
because that is pretty insane price

1540.84 --> 1543.84
increase

1559.2 --> 1562.96
when it comes to recreation

1569.84 --> 1573.36
wow what

1575.679 --> 1579.1200000000001
what do you mean when it comes to

1582.84 --> 1589.4099999999999
recreation

1585.54 --> 1589.4099999999999
[Music]

1596.84 --> 1601.36
uh

1598.96 --> 1601.3600000000001
okay

1602.64 --> 1608.24
but i don't really understand though

1604.32 --> 1613.36
like why why would those prices

1608.24 --> 1617.84
increase like that

1613.36 --> 1617.84
and why specifically devices for

1624.84 --> 1627.84
recreation

1634.24 --> 1637.039
that demand

1639.44 --> 1642.799
what the demand

1650.96 --> 1654.0
the demand has lowered is that what

1652.64 --> 1656.7990000000002
you're saying because the demand is

1654.0 --> 1659.919
lower the price is higher

1656.799 --> 1659.9189999999999
or the other way around

1660.72 --> 1664.159
because if you're just saying it's

1662.799 --> 1666.96
because of market

1664.159 --> 1669.8400000000001
natural market working i highly doubt

1666.96 --> 1669.8400000000001
that

1674.159 --> 1686.159
demand is high right

1682.24 --> 1688.72
wait okay let me think about that

1686.159 --> 1689.44
so in a way i guess that would make

1688.72 --> 1692.88
sense

1689.44 --> 1694.559
because people that had plenty of money

1692.88 --> 1698.24
they're also going to be affected by

1694.559 --> 1701.36
corona lockdown situations and they

1698.24 --> 1704.559
would just seek more

1701.36 --> 1706.7199999999998
vacation time equipment and all that

1704.559 --> 1708.32
so in yeah from that perspective it

1706.72 --> 1711.84
makes sense

1708.32 --> 1711.84
now i get it

1725.6 --> 1728.7199999999998
did i find out why david knight left

1727.919 --> 1739.8400000000001
infowars

1728.72 --> 1739.84
nope not really

1784.96 --> 1788.72
economists are very worried about

1787.12 --> 1795.84
inflation

1788.72 --> 1795.84
after corona goes away

1799.679 --> 1809.8400000000001
i okay

1822.0 --> 1825.84
well in a way it does kind of make sense

1824.96 --> 1829.679
because

1825.84 --> 1829.6789999999999
if there's being a lot of money printed

1829.76 --> 1834.72
but at the same time places to spend it

1833.039 --> 1837.919
at

1834.72 --> 1842.64
are significantly decreasing

1837.919 --> 1842.64
then inflation sounds like it would make

1848.84 --> 1851.84
sense

1860.64 --> 1864.0
30 of all u.s money has been printed

1863.44 --> 1879.8400000000001
last year

1864.0 --> 1879.84
i heard i heard such things yeah

1890.84 --> 1893.84
um

1900.559 --> 1903.6789999999999
it will never get paid back yeah well

1902.48 --> 1906.32
how are

1903.679 --> 1906.88
like but that's the whole thing isn't it

1906.32 --> 1910.559
so

1906.88 --> 1914.159
the giant asymmetry

1910.559 --> 1915.9189999999999
financially that's it was already

1914.159 --> 1917.519
out of control it's just getting worse

1915.919 --> 1919.2
out of control and

1917.519 --> 1922.32
i don't know i think at some point there

1919.2 --> 1925.2
should be a recognition like

1922.32 --> 1927.36
this entire setup is just asymmetrical

1925.2 --> 1927.3600000000001
and

1930.08 --> 1936.799
has to change like it

1933.6 --> 1938.9599999999998
it shouldn't be working like this

1936.799 --> 1941.84
and what yeah and people that are

1938.96 --> 1943.919
supposedly having complete ownership

1941.84 --> 1945.6789999999999
over everything because of this they

1943.919 --> 1949.44
should not have

1945.679 --> 1952.88
that that should stop

1949.44 --> 1952.88
because it doesn't make any sense

1954.88 --> 1962.0800000000002
like what did they even do

1958.88 --> 1963.679
to deserve all that what did they

1962.08 --> 1968.1589999999999
actually do to deserve

1963.679 --> 1969.1200000000001
all that all that supposed ownership

1968.159 --> 1971.0390000000002
through the

1969.12 --> 1972.2399999999998
through the currency through the debts

1971.039 --> 1976.0
and all that

1972.24 --> 1991.84
see that it doesn't make any sense

1976.0 --> 1991.84
to assume that

2017.44 --> 2022.24
pandemic castle governments are broken

2030.84 --> 2033.84
right

2044.84 --> 2047.84
so

2052.8 --> 2058.48
right indeed ares 106.

2056.72 --> 2061.839
now they shouldn't be printing you know

2058.48 --> 2061.839
it's ridiculous but

2068.48 --> 2075.839
hello by the way roman stanley good to

2070.32 --> 2075.839
see you

2079.08 --> 2082.44
[Music]

2115.2 --> 2119.1189999999997
uh i just thinking

2120.72 --> 2124.0789999999997
being presented with all these

2128.839 --> 2132.7999999999997
difficulties

2130.24 --> 2134.64
i'm trying to think back because i've

2132.8 --> 2137.52
seen quite a few

2134.64 --> 2141.1189999999997
documentaries just about financial

2137.52 --> 2145.68
system how that works and situations and

2141.119 --> 2148.56
what happens

2145.68 --> 2149.359
but really i do think that this like

2148.56 --> 2154.24
this

2149.359 --> 2154.24
debt situation that

2155.119 --> 2159.839
like i'm trying to figure out what it

2156.72 --> 2159.839
really is and like

2161.76 --> 2165.8390000000004
like does it actually mean anything

2166.24 --> 2169.2799999999997
or should it at some point just be

2168.32 --> 2172.8
nullified

2169.28 --> 2175.8390000000004
just like nope

2172.8 --> 2179.119
let's reset that this has

2175.839 --> 2182.96
gone out of control for long enough

2179.119 --> 2184.96
let's start square one

2182.96 --> 2186.32
i don't know maybe that is just too

2184.96 --> 2188.32
complicated

2186.32 --> 2191.76
maybe this [ __ ] will hit the fan in big

2188.32 --> 2191.76
ways that i don't understand

2194.64 --> 2199.2799999999997
every time i hear like of oh the great

2196.8 --> 2200.0
reset and financial reset and everything

2199.28 --> 2202.88
i'm like

2200.0 --> 2204.72
yeah on the surface that's a pretty

2202.88 --> 2207.28
logical conclusion that you would have

2204.72 --> 2210.7999999999997
to do that in this situation but

2207.28 --> 2212.5600000000004
yet of course the agenda the new world

2210.8 --> 2216.079
order plan wants to

2212.56 --> 2216.88
roll it one a whole lot of steps not

2216.079 --> 2218.7200000000003
just even one

2216.88 --> 2220.48
it's a whole lot of steps towards the

2218.72 --> 2224.3999999999996
neo-feudal system

2220.48 --> 2224.4
further into technocracy and all that

2225.04 --> 2231.68
and yeah but

2229.44 --> 2235.359
maybe just resetting the financial

2231.68 --> 2235.359
system nullifying that

2235.599 --> 2240.96
maybe that could kind of solve the

2238.88 --> 2243.839
situation and prevent everything from

2240.96 --> 2243.839
just breaking apart

2252.8 --> 2257.8390000000004
i have to surrender ownership of every

2255.52 --> 2257.839
anything

2268.839 --> 2271.839
what

2296.839 --> 2299.839
so

2302.16 --> 2306.72
right robin stanley yeah of course now

2304.72 --> 2309.04
i'm i'm now talking about the

2306.72 --> 2311.2
world situation for myself yeah i've

2309.04 --> 2313.44
been trying to

2311.2 --> 2315.52
just ensure that i don't make more debt

2313.44 --> 2316.8
and work it the other way around and

2315.52 --> 2319.359
that's my main focus

2316.8 --> 2321.119
getting away all my debt and then

2319.359 --> 2325.119
hopefully getting some serio

2321.119 --> 2327.44
yeah serious at least some

2325.119 --> 2329.839
surplus situation going and keeping it

2327.44 --> 2329.839
going

2332.8 --> 2339.3590000000004
but at the same time yeah i'm in

2336.4 --> 2341.599
i'm living inside a world where yeah

2339.359 --> 2343.52
this situation is going on and i'm going

2341.599 --> 2346.4
to be affected

2343.52 --> 2349.44
even just by empathy so i'm just trying

2346.4 --> 2349.44
to figure out okay

2350.64 --> 2355.839
maybe a giant debt reset

2401.28 --> 2404.32
are you talking about

2406.96 --> 2411.839
george sanford what

2412.8 --> 2425.8390000000004
rob h

2426.319 --> 2431.2
yeah solid plan for sustainable personal

2428.8 --> 2431.2000000000003
future

2434.64 --> 2438.0789999999997
it's very complicated though you really

2437.599 --> 2440.2400000000002
have to

2438.079 --> 2453.8390000000004
figure it out for yourself each and

2440.24 --> 2453.839
every one

2471.2 --> 2481.839
okay justin for that right

2494.8 --> 2499.3590000000004
all right now take it easy there rub h

2506.72 --> 2523.839
i'm pretty sure you don't have a castle

2536.8 --> 2541.44
okay an english saying is it

2542.96 --> 2546.0
never heard of that one

2547.2 --> 2551.839
your home is your castle yeah i know

2548.8 --> 2551.8390000000004
about that

2553.04 --> 2565.839
that i know that saying

2590.839 --> 2595.119
hmm

2592.079 --> 2598.319
well george sanford look the way you

2595.119 --> 2599.44
you put it down right now you got to

2598.319 --> 2601.52
realize that

2599.44 --> 2603.76
of course depending on where you are in

2601.52 --> 2607.2
the world

2603.76 --> 2610.4
the government represents in most cases

2607.2 --> 2610.96
the people or it should be doing that it

2610.4 --> 2613.52
legally

2610.96 --> 2614.64
is doing that and there's a constitution

2613.52 --> 2617.7599999999998
and all that so

2614.64 --> 2620.7999999999997
yeah technically you might be renting

2617.76 --> 2622.8
land from the government

2620.8 --> 2624.4
but you're basically renting it from

2622.8 --> 2626.319
other people

2624.4 --> 2629.119
so they can't just come in and take

2626.319 --> 2629.119
anything they want

2631.359 --> 2636.0789999999997
because the constitution web depending

2634.56 --> 2640.0789999999997
on where you are

2636.079 --> 2642.0
prevents that i know there are certain

2640.079 --> 2645.44
countries in which you don't have

2642.0 --> 2648.64
any kind of rights like that at all

2645.44 --> 2651.599
china right but

2648.64 --> 2652.96
most other countries they officially

2651.599 --> 2655.92
shouldn't be able to do that now they

2652.96 --> 2659.28
might criminally do that anyway

2655.92 --> 2661.359
right and then but yeah just buried

2659.28 --> 2661.76
under bureaucracy to make it not come

2661.359 --> 2665.5989999999997
out

2661.76 --> 2668.88
for as long as possible so in that sense

2665.599 --> 2672.1600000000003
nothing is a guarantee

2668.88 --> 2677.839
technically but legally

2672.16 --> 2677.839
it's a different world

2702.839 --> 2705.839
hmm

2730.839 --> 2733.839
hmm

2753.04 --> 2756.96
okay it was interesting what you're all

2755.68 --> 2758.0
saying it's kind of hard to follow

2756.96 --> 2760.64
though because you're all saying

2758.0 --> 2760.64
something different

2762.4 --> 2766.48
right i heard about that one the yeah

2765.2 --> 2770.319
the gold

2766.48 --> 2771.359
confiscation in cyprus that wasn't too

2770.319 --> 2775.839
long ago

2771.359 --> 2775.839
was it

2780.0 --> 2789.839
is that during the obama time

2783.28 --> 2789.8390000000004
i'm not too sure anymore

2802.96 --> 2806.319
oh right yeah that's right

2806.4 --> 2810.56
yes the bank like the digits they

2809.599 --> 2812.2400000000002
blocked it

2810.56 --> 2814.4
and then just took money from it yeah

2812.24 --> 2818.319
yeah that was it

2814.4 --> 2822.1600000000003
right they did not gold now the gold

2818.319 --> 2824.88
situation in the us that that's like

2822.16 --> 2831.839
what was that it was in the 20th century

2824.88 --> 2831.839
at least

2852.35 --> 2855.429
[Music]

2857.28 --> 2873.8390000000004
right right here we go again yeah i

2859.839 --> 2873.839

[Music]

2954.839 --> 2957.839
whoa

2965.2 --> 2968.319
oh i didn't even know that george

2967.119 --> 2971.6800000000003
sanford

2968.319 --> 2973.599
about canadia canada really

2971.68 --> 2976.24
taking people's pensions just like that

2973.599 --> 2976.2400000000002
that's just

2982.839 --> 2985.839
insane

3003.359 --> 3013.839
state pensions right

3017.52 --> 3020.719
[Music]

3022.0 --> 3025.28
our other country's increasing

3023.52 --> 3029.599
retirement age

3025.28 --> 3041.8390000000004
and the netherlands they are i think

3029.599 --> 3041.839
are always trying that

3091.68 --> 3097.839
right because they don't have enough

3093.68 --> 3097.839
money to pay pensions yeah yeah

3108.839 --> 3111.839
right

3128.16 --> 3132.48
all right well look it's eventually it's

3131.52 --> 3135.839
just going to be

3132.48 --> 3137.599
pushed to a point where it's good

3135.839 --> 3139.44
people are going to really have to

3137.599 --> 3143.6800000000003
decide like okay

3139.44 --> 3145.839
either we stop the covet nonsense

3143.68 --> 3147.68
all the measured all of it completely

3145.839 --> 3151.599
and try to

3147.68 --> 3154.0
build back up or like yeah

3151.599 --> 3154.96
like everybody's going to die not from

3154.0 --> 3158.0
any disease

3154.96 --> 3160.48
but from the freaking measures

3158.0 --> 3163.92
and it's good yeah at some point they're

3160.48 --> 3166.559
just gonna have to say like no

3163.92 --> 3168.8
we don't care anymore if everybody is

3166.559 --> 3171.28
supposedly going to die of this [ __ ]

3168.8 --> 3173.76
covet everybody is dying because the

3171.28 --> 3176.96
entire society is breaking down

3173.76 --> 3181.8390000000004
we don't give a [ __ ] about your disease

3176.96 --> 3181.839
like do whatever you know

3182.079 --> 3185.3590000000004
and then i bet that the freaking same

3184.48 --> 3187.119
people that is

3185.359 --> 3190.4
organizing this guy might actually go

3187.119 --> 3192.48
out and start poisoning people

3190.4 --> 3194.0
to spike back at the fair like oh no

3192.48 --> 3195.28
there's really it's really there it's

3194.0 --> 3198.319
really there it's really there

3195.28 --> 3199.2000000000003
and like they will try whatever but you

3198.319 --> 3202.5589999999997
can't

3199.2 --> 3204.96
you can't and then it's just going to be

3202.559 --> 3205.8390000000004
them revealing themselves and it's going

3204.96 --> 3209.52
to be more like

3205.839 --> 3212.96
warfare after that point

3209.52 --> 3214.88
i think or it's just going to stop

3212.96 --> 3216.96
entirely and they're not going to push

3214.88 --> 3220.1600000000003
it through

3216.96 --> 3221.92
but yeah it like the disease

3220.16 --> 3223.7599999999998
even if it was real at this point it

3221.92 --> 3226.96
doesn't matter anymore because

3223.76 --> 3230.0
everything that's happening is

3226.96 --> 3232.64
wrecking everything and it's you can't

3230.0 --> 3232.64
fix that

3234.72 --> 3239.52
you can't fix the wrecking

3242.24 --> 3246.9599999999996
the only way to to try to fix it is by

3245.359 --> 3248.96
just stopping and just

3246.96 --> 3251.92
submitting that one way or the other

3248.96 --> 3254.4
like it doesn't matter

3251.92 --> 3255.52
like whether you even believe covet is

3254.4 --> 3258.88
real

3255.52 --> 3261.68
it doesn't matter

3258.88 --> 3263.28
because the way things are handled right

3261.68 --> 3266.7599999999998
now

3263.28 --> 3271.44
absolute devastation is guaranteed

3266.76 --> 3274.0
guaranteed absolutely guaranteed

3271.44 --> 3277.44
so it just doesn't matter it doesn't

3274.0 --> 3280.72
matter whether it's [ __ ] real or not

3277.44 --> 3283.839
devastation is guaranteed if this course

3280.72 --> 3285.7599999999998
of action continues

3283.839 --> 3289.92
and with this course of actions i mean

3285.76 --> 3289.92
all the corona measures that are being

3290.839 --> 3293.839
implemented

3303.86 --> 3308.2490000000003
[Music]

3348.48 --> 3354.079
massive concessions by rumpus last fed

3351.76 --> 3354.079
show

3360.64 --> 3366.0789999999997
yeah i think i completely missed that

3363.28 --> 3367.8390000000004
not too sure though

3366.079 --> 3370.319
but yeah rompus has been amusing

3367.839 --> 3370.319
recently

3374.72 --> 3378.9599999999996
yeah i would much more rather like to go

3377.52 --> 3382.559
get into flat earth

3378.96 --> 3386.0
again than just this continual

3382.559 --> 3388.2400000000002
crap about the worst [ __ ] out there i

3386.0 --> 3388.24
just

3388.839 --> 3391.839
oh

3416.839 --> 3419.839
wow

3427.68 --> 3432.319
oh george sanford is there even a funny

3430.079 --> 3435.3590000000004
part at this point

3432.319 --> 3438.72
like what part about

3435.359 --> 3441.5589999999997
it not being actually real is funny

3438.72 --> 3443.2799999999997
while totally yeah society is literally

3441.559 --> 3447.8390000000004
disintegrating around you

3443.28 --> 3447.8390000000004
what's funny about that

3449.44 --> 3452.799
oh yeah he basically said there's no 4d

3451.839 --> 3456.0789999999997
space

3452.799 --> 3456.079
just have to imagine it

3459.359 --> 3463.2
i'm gonna have to watch that one back i

3461.839 --> 3466.64
might have been making lunch or

3463.2 --> 3466.64
something when that was happening

3467.28 --> 3475.8390000000004
not too sure

3480.72 --> 3489.839
newtonian and einsteinian gravity are

3483.119 --> 3489.839
incompatible yeah mathematically

3501.44 --> 3505.599
i think i was listening to that in the

3514.839 --> 3517.839
background

3523.92 --> 3531.359
it's funny isn't it with gravity

3527.359 --> 3534.0
what is it i've been thinking about it

3531.359 --> 3536.799
instantly like nobody really know what

3534.0 --> 3541.04
it is because it's not been

3536.799 --> 3541.04
properly defined like ever

3541.599 --> 3547.44
so maybe it's not about

3544.72 --> 3550.72
what gravity is or it's rather about

3547.44 --> 3550.7200000000003
what it represents

3550.88 --> 3555.359
which would make it absolutely

3552.64 --> 3558.64
non-physics

3555.359 --> 3561.44
i think it's just

3558.64 --> 3561.44
it's yeah

3565.52 --> 3570.319
it's an aberration for for starters like

3568.24 --> 3570.8799999999997
physics related whatever was conceived

3570.319 --> 3573.119
from it

3570.88 --> 3574.96
that's an aberration but i think that

3573.119 --> 3577.04
the whole the whole gravity idea really

3574.96 --> 3581.28
is just the machination

3577.04 --> 3584.079
it's yeah to make it into the globe

3581.28 --> 3585.2000000000003
it's like the thing they thought up to

3584.079 --> 3589.04
quickly

3585.2 --> 3591.52
fix it so it is like one of the first

3589.04 --> 3595.04
real machinations

3591.52 --> 3597.92
and there first was an

3595.04 --> 3599.92
attempt to make it masked to mass

3597.92 --> 3601.359
through newton but he didn't really want

3599.92 --> 3605.52
to associate with that

3601.359 --> 3606.96
in the end and then einstein

3605.52 --> 3608.799
played around with it and made it

3606.96 --> 3611.599
completely virtual so that you can't

3608.799 --> 3614.72
even tie it in with physical

3611.599 --> 3616.6400000000003
reality anymore but it's

3614.72 --> 3619.7599999999998
so gravity is more about what does it

3616.64 --> 3622.8799999999997
represent it represents a

3619.76 --> 3627.599
elusive machination

3622.88 --> 3628.079
that is required in order to imagine the

3627.599 --> 3630.799
earth

3628.079 --> 3630.799
being a ball

3634.559 --> 3639.2000000000003
and because it's such a key machination

3637.52 --> 3642.88
it's like the

3639.2 --> 3646.0
the stitch that holds it all together

3642.88 --> 3649.28
it as it as a seemingly uniform thing

3646.0 --> 3652.0
and that's why it had to be

3649.28 --> 3655.119
blurred out of reality so that you can't

3652.0 --> 3655.119
figure out what it is

3655.76 --> 3660.48
from within the believer perspective so

3658.079 --> 3662.6400000000003
yeah you wouldn't accidentally undo the

3660.48 --> 3663.599
stitch and then pop the entire dream

3662.64 --> 3666.16
bubble

3663.599 --> 3666.1600000000003
as it were

3666.72 --> 3685.4399999999996
so it really is like a machination

3670.88 --> 3687.359
is gravity a supposition

3685.44 --> 3689.359
well if you're gonna go by the physics

3687.359 --> 3692.799
standard it's

3689.359 --> 3692.799
it's yeah

3693.28 --> 3698.079
it well officially einstein einsteinian

3697.52 --> 3700.72
gravity

3698.079 --> 3703.28
it's just a concept so it's not even a

3700.72 --> 3707.1189999999997
supposition

3703.28 --> 3710.1600000000003
like a newtonian concept with a

3707.119 --> 3713.44
force field literally a field of

3710.16 --> 3713.92
pressing force in a direction which is

3713.44 --> 3716.7200000000003
more

3713.92 --> 3718.88
in the direction of what newton sort of

3716.72 --> 3721.9199999999996
conceived

3718.88 --> 3724.2400000000002
that would be a supposition for certain

3721.92 --> 3724.7200000000003
but officially gravity is not that it's

3724.24 --> 3727.7599999999998
not

3724.72 --> 3729.52
claimed to be that it's just blabbered

3727.76 --> 3732.559
about endlessly

3729.52 --> 3732.96
speculated in the wild and people just

3732.559 --> 3735.52
hold

3732.96 --> 3735.52
on to that

3736.079 --> 3740.48
because gravity is no longer really

3739.119 --> 3744.88
definable

3740.48 --> 3746.72
in physics terms not really

3744.88 --> 3748.7200000000003
but people still think it is and they

3746.72 --> 3755.839
play around with that but it's just

3748.72 --> 3755.839
toys it's just toys

3756.88 --> 3762.0
like nostalgic toys and people can't

3760.319 --> 3763.2799999999997
stop playing with it because they're not

3762.0 --> 3765.2
getting the real thing

3763.28 --> 3767.28
because it is no longer tied into

3765.2 --> 3769.2799999999997
physical reality officially

3767.28 --> 3770.88
it's just this virtual thing and just

3769.28 --> 3783.8390000000004
like oh you think you can figure out

3770.88 --> 3783.839
what gravity is good luck with that

3798.16 --> 3801.839
like a myth to carry the narrative in a

3800.96 --> 3804.88
way

3801.839 --> 3809.2799999999997
but it's also because of

3804.88 --> 3812.4
the necessity of an honest

3809.28 --> 3814.88
conscious clean perspective to be part

3812.4 --> 3817.839
of that to be naive and leave it

3814.88 --> 3819.599
people will be digging they will be like

3817.839 --> 3821.44
wanting to figure it out and help

3819.599 --> 3823.76
everyone or just

3821.44 --> 3824.96
see if they can master the whole thing

3823.76 --> 3828.079
enough that they can be

3824.96 --> 3830.48
on top of it and expand it further

3828.079 --> 3831.28
dig through reality figure out things

3830.48 --> 3834.96
even further

3831.28 --> 3835.44
so they will have need training and need

3834.96 --> 3838.559
to

3835.44 --> 3841.359
do something well that's where the

3838.559 --> 3842.96
gravity toys newtonian gravity comes in

3841.359 --> 3845.359
a lot

3842.96 --> 3847.76
it's typically what you start playing

3845.359 --> 3850.88
with it's also presented as such but

3847.76 --> 3852.88
it's not officially recognized anymore

3850.88 --> 3854.1600000000003
and you only really get to hear about

3852.88 --> 3856.96
that

3854.16 --> 3856.96
after a while

3857.52 --> 3860.96
and there's so many people still

3859.119 --> 3861.44
screwing around and assuming that it's

3860.96 --> 3865.039
just

3861.44 --> 3866.96
that it's very easy to just forget

3865.039 --> 3869.5200000000004
and just start playing with it again

3866.96 --> 3872.559
like the rest of the people that are

3869.52 --> 3875.359
seemingly trying to figure it out

3872.559 --> 3875.3590000000004
just like you

3877.52 --> 3880.799
so it's this toy and it doesn't tie into

3879.599 --> 3883.6800000000003
physical reality

3880.799 --> 3884.16
because it's not recognized as such as a

3883.68 --> 3886.8799999999997
re as

3884.16 --> 3888.64
the real thing no it's einstein gravity

3886.88 --> 3890.6400000000003
is the recognized thing

3888.64 --> 3892.96
and it there is no tie-in with physical

3890.64 --> 3897.68
reality but you can think that it is

3892.96 --> 3897.68
and you can try to screw with that

3898.24 --> 3902.24
describe it metaphorize it but

3900.72 --> 3904.5589999999997
eventually it's always going to be just

3902.24 --> 3906.9599999999996
a conjuration from a fictional thing

3904.559 --> 3908.0
into physical reality and you can't

3906.96 --> 3911.52
really prove that because

3908.0 --> 3915.839
you don't have any phenomena

3911.52 --> 3918.16
no actual phenomenon that cannot be

3915.839 --> 3920.24
proven scientifically to be caused by

3918.16 --> 3923.0389999999998
something else

3920.24 --> 3926.0
like for example relative density

3923.039 --> 3927.92
disequilibrium displacement

3926.0 --> 3930.64
which is suggested to be caused by

3927.92 --> 3932.4
gravity from a newtonian perspective

3930.64 --> 3933.7599999999998
it's actually relative density this

3932.4 --> 3935.6800000000003
equilibrium

3933.76 --> 3951.44
force that is causing that through

3935.68 --> 3954.48
relative density theory

3951.44 --> 3956.64
so they basically cut off the road there

3954.48 --> 3959.599
and leave it to wild speculation and

3956.64 --> 3963.1189999999997
they hope that some magical plant

3959.599 --> 3966.7200000000003
is gonna bloom forth from the

3963.119 --> 3969.599
roots to figure out what gravity is but

3966.72 --> 3972.24
all of it is a self-create self-creating

3969.599 --> 3974.48
self-perpetuating myth because

3972.24 --> 3975.839
people don't really know what gravity is

3974.48 --> 3979.599
but they all get

3975.839 --> 3982.72
the story and that story

3979.599 --> 3984.7200000000003
they get to love and appreciate

3982.72 --> 3986.5589999999997
about the heliocentric universe and

3984.72 --> 3989.5989999999997
everything

3986.559 --> 3992.3190000000004
and then their feelings will

3989.599 --> 3993.44
demand from them that they figure out

3992.319 --> 3998.48
great gravity

3993.44 --> 3998.48
is to reinforce all that imagery

3999.2 --> 4003.1189999999997
even though nobody knows what it really

4002.64 --> 4004.8799999999997
is

4003.119 --> 4006.7200000000003
and that's part of the trick so people

4004.88 --> 4011.44
get locked in

4006.72 --> 4011.4399999999996
mentally through the love of the beauty

4011.599 --> 4017.6800000000003
to find it to help it

4014.64 --> 4021.52
to help the imagery

4017.68 --> 4024.3999999999996
to reify that you have to find

4021.52 --> 4025.44
gravity figure out what it is see and

4024.4 --> 4028.559
that's the trick

4025.44 --> 4030.319
that's the big part of the trick and it

4028.559 --> 4032.88
it gets people stuck in there

4030.319 --> 4035.52
good willing people that are don't know

4032.88 --> 4038.799
their spellbound

4035.52 --> 4039.7599999999998
in trying to reify the heliocentric

4038.799 --> 4042.96
universe

4039.76 --> 4043.44
and outer space and all the imagination

4042.96 --> 4045.52
stuff

4043.44 --> 4049.28
and science fiction that has been

4045.52 --> 4052.64
conjured within it to realify that

4049.28 --> 4055.28
reify it by figuring out

4052.64 --> 4057.44
what is gravity because it has to be

4055.28 --> 4059.76
there because otherwise

4057.44 --> 4061.599
none of the imagery none of that fantasy

4059.76 --> 4062.7200000000003
would make any sense and it couldn't be

4061.599 --> 4065.2000000000003
possible

4062.72 --> 4065.2
one day

4070.4 --> 4073.52
and then yeah most people once they

4072.96 --> 4075.119
figure

4073.52 --> 4077.68
something out there they get a hint of

4075.119 --> 4080.0
it it's too painful

4077.68 --> 4081.2
and so they take a step back forget

4080.0 --> 4082.88
about it

4081.2 --> 4084.5589999999997
and then at some point they'll get

4082.88 --> 4086.6400000000003
caught up in the same process same

4084.559 --> 4088.6400000000003
staircase again

4086.64 --> 4090.5589999999997
until they realize it again and then

4088.64 --> 4092.8799999999997
they'll stop

4090.559 --> 4094.7200000000003
and they'll climb back down and i've

4092.88 --> 4098.64
been through that process

4094.72 --> 4098.639999999999
several times throughout my life

4100.56 --> 4103.6
and not specifically with gravity but

4102.799 --> 4107.12
with

4103.6 --> 4107.120000000001
the one the wider skill

4107.279 --> 4110.64
there's other angles of this kind of

4110.159 --> 4113.92
like

4110.64 --> 4116.08
these mechanisms like gravity it's not

4113.92 --> 4116.08
just

4116.839 --> 4121.6
physics

4118.56 --> 4125.359
so politics and

4121.6 --> 4125.359
history everything

4130.799 --> 4134.239
oh yeah i had a weird skype incident by

4132.88 --> 4138.0
the way

4134.239 --> 4138.0
yeah that was really odd

4143.92 --> 4149.04
like skype suddenly i don't know if it

4147.199 --> 4150.639999999999
was some kind of a memory glitch or

4149.04 --> 4153.359
something because the

4150.64 --> 4153.839
the font the whole thing was using was

4153.359 --> 4157.839
getting

4153.839 --> 4162.799
really blurred up and weird

4157.839 --> 4162.799
let's see i think i can show that

4164.48 --> 4167.2789999999995
let me find it

4169.6 --> 4178.64
where did i put it

4175.44 --> 4183.04
right here it is

4178.64 --> 4183.04
look at that that's what it looked like

4187.199 --> 4190.3189999999995
it's kind of difficult to figure out

4189.839 --> 4192.239
what

4190.319 --> 4194.080000000001
is what even though there are still

4192.239 --> 4199.44
pictures there

4194.08 --> 4199.44
that i sort of recognize but yeah

4200.719 --> 4206.56
but my skype was like that for

4204.8 --> 4208.8
for like eight hours or something and i

4206.56 --> 4211.4400000000005
had to like uninstall it

4208.8 --> 4212.56
and reboot my computer and then download

4211.44 --> 4215.599999999999
the newest version

4212.56 --> 4218.719
and then eventually after two attempts

4215.6 --> 4231.84
it yeah it changed back to normal

4218.719 --> 4231.84
that was weird

4234.719 --> 4238.159
that's klingon what

4238.4 --> 4242.0
what are you saying iron 26

4242.32 --> 4245.84
looks like

4255.44 --> 4260.639999999999
stupid pop-up sounds

4258.96 --> 4264.2390000000005
yeah quit skype again i don't want to

4260.64 --> 4264.2390000000005
hear those pop-up sounds for another

4270.84 --> 4273.84
hour

4274.08 --> 4282.32
oh the text is in klingon right

4277.92 --> 4282.32
uh i don't know what klingon looks like

4282.48 --> 4287.839999999999
i wouldn't know

4291.47 --> 4294.9890000000005
[Music]

4312.84 --> 4315.84
right

4351.84 --> 4356.32
right anyway yeah i think that was

4354.64 --> 4359.84
pretty interesting how to put that down

4356.32 --> 4359.84
the psychological process

4360.239 --> 4363.599999999999
that is involved with gravity with what

4362.32 --> 4366.239
it is what it stands for

4363.6 --> 4366.8
the history of it and what people do

4366.239 --> 4370.08
with it

4366.8 --> 4373.360000000001
you see because i think that

4370.08 --> 4373.679
with a lot of stuff and material that we

4373.36 --> 4376.799999999999
are

4373.679 --> 4378.2390000000005
being taught in school and all that it's

4376.8 --> 4381.360000000001
not even as much as

4378.239 --> 4383.199
what it says

4381.36 --> 4384.4
because we can figure out whether that's

4383.199 --> 4388.0
lies or not or

4384.4 --> 4390.5599999999995
at least attempt to and give a moral

4388.0 --> 4393.84
reflection on it and all that

4390.56 --> 4396.719
but it's about what it does to people

4393.84 --> 4397.360000000001
like what do they do with it how does it

4396.719 --> 4400.8
echo

4397.36 --> 4403.44
on and alter

4400.8 --> 4403.4400000000005
what they do

4405.6 --> 4409.04
and i think gravity really was like

4407.76 --> 4411.6
meant like this

4409.04 --> 4413.6
sandbox trap where they just leave you

4411.6 --> 4417.120000000001
stuck in there and then just

4413.6 --> 4420.08
encourage you if you're like a digger

4417.12 --> 4423.12
they encourage you yeah yeah well maybe

4420.08 --> 4426.48
you can find out what gravity is

4423.12 --> 4429.84
and then because you're so used it you

4426.48 --> 4431.599999999999
you don't even hear that

4429.84 --> 4433.84
when they say when they say something

4431.6 --> 4438.08
like that that it is like a trick

4433.84 --> 4443.12
question that is that it is a trick

4438.08 --> 4446.64
it's like if you don't know what it is

4443.12 --> 4450.08
then why would you think that you can

4446.64 --> 4453.679
find it like that it doesn't

4450.08 --> 4456.4
it's paradox it's a paradoxical thing

4453.679 --> 4458.4800000000005
to even say that and people don't

4456.4 --> 4460.4
understand

4458.48 --> 4461.919999999999
they lost track they're so used to

4460.4 --> 4463.839999999999
playing with the tools that they don't

4461.92 --> 4467.36
even realize anymore that it is

4463.84 --> 4470.88
a paradoxical thing they're engaging at

4467.36 --> 4474.159
like if you don't know what it is

4470.88 --> 4476.32
in physics then how could you

4474.159 --> 4477.5199999999995
find it and why would you assume it's

4476.32 --> 4479.28
there

4477.52 --> 4480.8
because in physics it's usually the

4479.28 --> 4482.0
other way around you have the phenomena

4480.8 --> 4485.52
and then you try to figure

4482.0 --> 4487.44
out what it is what's causing it

4485.52 --> 4489.6
so if you don't even know what it is

4487.44 --> 4491.04
then why would you assume something is

4489.6 --> 4492.719
there

4491.04 --> 4495.12
how what are you going to look for

4492.719 --> 4495.84
that's going to fit the description of

4495.12 --> 4498.32
what you think

4495.84 --> 4500.8
it's supposed to be it's it's total

4498.32 --> 4500.799999999999
madness

4504.8 --> 4511.679
it's like a conjuration

4508.84 --> 4513.4400000000005
but a control

4511.679 --> 4514.96
because somebody that can do the

4513.44 --> 4519.5199999999995
conjuration can be

4514.96 --> 4519.52
left out of what they're actually doing

4521.84 --> 4527.1990000000005
so they don't even know they are

4524.159 --> 4527.199
conjuring something

4529.36 --> 4539.839999999999
yes what a good description you become

4531.76 --> 4539.84
part of a circular maze

4542.239 --> 4547.678999999999
right later iron 26 thanks for being in

4550.84 --> 4553.84
chat

4554.09 --> 4557.1990000000005
[Music]

4560.56 --> 4565.4400000000005
right it's part of circular maze but

4563.199 --> 4567.839999999999
it's also like chasing a myth

4565.44 --> 4569.599999999999
it's just as a rough analogy or

4567.84 --> 4571.4400000000005
comparison just imagine like

4569.6 --> 4573.84
something in greek mythology and it's

4571.44 --> 4577.28
like really really popular

4573.84 --> 4580.08
and everybody always talks about this

4577.28 --> 4582.96
it's prometheus or something and then if

4580.08 --> 4585.44
it's like really important and really

4582.96 --> 4587.12
used it's like this is so important

4585.44 --> 4588.639999999999
there's gonna be people that don't

4587.12 --> 4592.08
really understand

4588.64 --> 4595.76
that about metaphors that are literally

4592.08 --> 4599.44
going to try and find it to reify

4595.76 --> 4603.12
that that imagery that esoteric

4599.44 --> 4606.239
interpretation of an esoteric thing

4603.12 --> 4608.719
see it's a mistake children also do this

4606.239 --> 4612.239
sort of thing

4608.719 --> 4614.8
but yeah that some people

4612.239 --> 4615.839999999999
just keep doing that they don't figure

4614.8 --> 4619.52
that out

4615.84 --> 4623.28
ever especially modern day

4619.52 --> 4625.4400000000005
they overlook it they stay naive

4623.28 --> 4626.639999999999
and they will just be caught up in

4625.44 --> 4630.639999999999
trying to reify

4626.64 --> 4633.1990000000005
something that shouldn't be reified

4630.64 --> 4633.76
it's a myth that they're trying to make

4633.199 --> 4636.08
real

4633.76 --> 4637.84
because they interpreted wrong they

4636.08 --> 4639.92
didn't understand what they were looking

4637.84 --> 4639.92
at

4646.0 --> 4652.08
or what they were listening to so they

4648.88 --> 4652.08
just want it to be real

4655.92 --> 4659.4400000000005
ah i can already hear some ballers don't

4658.719 --> 4661.92
know

4659.44 --> 4664.0
if necessarily in my chat or anything in

4661.92 --> 4666.2390000000005
their mind like oh yes yes

4664.0 --> 4668.8
like the flat earthers are trying to

4666.239 --> 4670.959999999999
imagine their flat earth model

4668.8 --> 4673.12
into reality i know that's what they're

4670.96 --> 4675.44
thinking right now even as they hear

4673.12 --> 4677.199
me maybe in a back recording i don't

4675.44 --> 4680.32
know if any ballers is gonna watch

4677.199 --> 4680.799999999999
life you can hear them doing that and

4680.32 --> 4683.04
that

4680.8 --> 4684.64
that they're doing that because they

4683.04 --> 4687.679
kind of instinctively know that's

4684.64 --> 4689.84
exactly what they do with the ball

4687.679 --> 4691.52
but because some flat earthers has kind

4689.84 --> 4694.56
of like

4691.52 --> 4696.719
mirrored that behavior to present an

4694.56 --> 4701.120000000001
alternative for somebody to hop onto

4696.719 --> 4702.96
with the domed disc model

4701.12 --> 4705.199
they now latch on to that and just

4702.96 --> 4706.56
project it exclusively on what flat

4705.199 --> 4709.04
earthers do

4706.56 --> 4711.6
even though the flat earthers that did

4709.04 --> 4712.08
that copied that from the ballers to try

4711.6 --> 4721.84
and get

4712.08 --> 4721.84
people out of it yeah

4742.719 --> 4749.84
no comment all right

4756.64 --> 4760.4800000000005
all right i refreshed the page and it

4758.719 --> 4763.76
seems like the

4760.48 --> 4766.32
votes don't really

4763.76 --> 4767.04
show themselves because i had a lot more

4766.32 --> 4769.12
when i

4767.04 --> 4777.84
refreshed the page i thought that was

4769.12 --> 4777.84
being live updated i guess not

4779.12 --> 4782.8
because the young radio is fascinated by

4780.719 --> 4783.28
acres right exactly so you know what i

4782.8 --> 4785.1990000000005
mean

4783.28 --> 4786.719
because people you people do start

4785.199 --> 4788.239
dreaming about what

4786.719 --> 4790.64
they're reading especially if it's

4788.239 --> 4793.678999999999
inspiring to them

4790.64 --> 4793.679
but some people

4793.92 --> 4800.32
get also caught up in actually trying to

4797.52 --> 4801.76
then really find it and i know because i

4800.32 --> 4803.759999999999
used to be one of those

4801.76 --> 4806.08
i did a lot of it in secret because i

4803.76 --> 4806.08
didn't

4806.88 --> 4810.0
yeah didn't want to snap on it but i was

4809.6 --> 4812.320000000001
a

4810.0 --> 4813.04
big magical thinker in many ways

4812.32 --> 4815.599999999999
throughout

4813.04 --> 4817.5199999999995
a lot of my very young youth i think i

4815.6 --> 4818.639
shared that that was just mostly in my

4817.52 --> 4821.679
head

4818.639 --> 4821.679
in my pre-teens

4824.639 --> 4828.32
and it took me in all kinds of

4830.84 --> 4833.84
directions

4844.4 --> 4850.239
right yeah it in ways

4848.159 --> 4852.159
what they said about me how it's

4850.239 --> 4856.239
described is like i was a

4852.159 --> 4858.48
very impressionable young kid

4856.239 --> 4859.599999999999
that's how they would describe that very

4858.48 --> 4861.5199999999995
impressionable

4859.6 --> 4863.1990000000005
because i saw something i would get

4861.52 --> 4866.2390000000005
really inspired by it

4863.199 --> 4869.44
i wouldn't go like i wouldn't go like

4866.239 --> 4870.959999999999
nutty level like overloaded by

4869.44 --> 4873.36
that happens to some people too it's

4870.96 --> 4875.04
very sad they just get over excited like

4873.36 --> 4876.239
so over excited like their body just

4875.04 --> 4878.8
goes till

4876.239 --> 4879.839999999999
right not like that but every time

4878.8 --> 4882.96
something happened

4879.84 --> 4886.2390000000005
it would i would get totally like

4882.96 --> 4886.2390000000005
immersed in it and like

4886.84 --> 4894.2390000000005
becoming assimilating it to the maximum

4891.44 --> 4895.199
efficiency or i'm not even efficiency

4894.239 --> 4896.959999999999
but just

4895.199 --> 4899.04
getting really caught up in it really

4896.96 --> 4903.84
impressionable so whatever it is

4899.04 --> 4903.84
wherever it would take me

4908.88 --> 4914.719
yeah and eventually it started taking me

4911.92 --> 4914.719
places where

4914.8 --> 4917.84
it wasn't really safe

4920.0 --> 4925.199
but i just had to learn that the hard

4921.679 --> 4927.92
way because i tried to reify

4925.199 --> 4929.678999999999
the good into reality i was basically

4927.92 --> 4931.84
denying evil

4929.679 --> 4933.1990000000005
from existence that's part of things

4931.84 --> 4935.92
that i

4933.199 --> 4936.239
got caught up caught up in as a kid like

4935.92 --> 4945.84
i

4936.239 --> 4945.839999999999
refused to accept evil that it was real

4949.76 --> 4959.84
i just thought it was all an act

4984.84 --> 4987.84
hmm

4998.84 --> 5002.2390000000005
um

5000.08 --> 5004.08
interesting robin stanley had this story

5002.239 --> 5007.599999999999
of icarus

5004.08 --> 5007.6
i might have read that

5008.8 --> 5016.08
but i probably was very occupy occupied

5013.6 --> 5018.08
by other situations

5016.08 --> 5019.12
so that they wouldn't rub off on me

5018.08 --> 5021.199
properly

5019.12 --> 5023.12
because i was too distracted during that

5021.199 --> 5024.96
time in school and all that

5023.12 --> 5028.4
i think they might have gone through

5024.96 --> 5032.159
that in school

5028.4 --> 5035.199
because we did have like greek mythology

5032.159 --> 5043.839999999999
in school in a certain school

5035.199 --> 5043.839999999999
it was really interesting though

5053.04 --> 5057.84
and that's like over 30 years ago

5068.84 --> 5071.84
wow

5088.44 --> 5092.429999999999
[Music]

5096.84 --> 5102.579
what

5098.59 --> 5102.579
[Music]

5126.239 --> 5129.759999999999
yeah i don't know anything about that

5127.84 --> 5141.84
rob h not

5129.76 --> 5141.84
particularly interested

5157.04 --> 5160.0
right so uh

5160.639 --> 5163.04
let's see

5164.32 --> 5169.84
still got a half hour to go

5180.84 --> 5183.84
um

5232.4 --> 5239.839999999999
nope i'm a blank

5236.56 --> 5239.84
i really am

5262.96 --> 5267.12
alright have a nice walk here we go

5265.6 --> 5271.280000000001
again

5267.12 --> 5271.28
need some exercise exercise is good

5271.6 --> 5275.76
in ways i miss the old days because when

5274.239 --> 5279.44
i started two o'clock

5275.76 --> 5283.6
i usually did my groceries

5279.44 --> 5286.0
before the show and then that would get

5283.6 --> 5288.2390000000005
me moving in my blood flowing a lot more

5286.0 --> 5290.719
and then i'd have less of these silent

5288.239 --> 5290.718999999999
moments

5291.199 --> 5295.599999999999
and now that i'm doing a two-hour show

5294.0 --> 5297.04
doesn't seem to work out like that

5295.6 --> 5300.2390000000005
anymore

5297.04 --> 5300.239
a bit sorry about that

5303.52 --> 5309.84
worldwide underground structures oh

5306.84 --> 5309.84
goody

5314.88 --> 5317.679
yeah see you later

5319.28 --> 5324.32
well right underground structures oh

5321.84 --> 5324.32
whatever

5325.76 --> 5329.679
we don't even completely know what's all

5328.4 --> 5337.839999999999
down there there's so many

5329.679 --> 5337.84
cave systems in

5340.56 --> 5343.6
make predictions within 10 years there

5342.639 --> 5346.88
will be hardly

5343.6 --> 5346.88
any flat earthers left

5347.12 --> 5354.48
in what sense tiny womble

5350.159 --> 5365.839999999999
in what sense can you be more specific

5354.48 --> 5365.839999999999
it's quite a claim

5370.719 --> 5373.76
like that could mean a whole range of

5372.48 --> 5376.5599999999995
things you mean that

5373.76 --> 5378.08
our free speech is going to be stifled

5376.56 --> 5381.280000000001
or they're literally going to kill

5378.08 --> 5384.8
us or you really think that we'll

5381.28 --> 5386.88
concede like naturally figure out that

5384.8 --> 5387.4400000000005
the earth turn out to be appalled after

5386.88 --> 5390.84
all

5387.44 --> 5392.239
really that's that's called magical

5390.84 --> 5394.96
thinking

5392.239 --> 5407.839999999999
that's fine you're a baller after all

5394.96 --> 5407.84
tiny wumbo

5411.76 --> 5414.96
everybody will be as confused as ballers

5414.48 --> 5417.36
but

5414.96 --> 5419.04
even if we were as confused as ballers

5417.36 --> 5421.599999999999
that doesn't mean that we will

5419.04 --> 5423.28
think the earth will be a ball and not

5421.6 --> 5426.400000000001
flat

5423.28 --> 5428.719
you see i don't think that's going to

5426.4 --> 5428.719
happen

5432.639 --> 5436.08
and i wonder also like

5436.48 --> 5440.959999999999
like where how would that happen

5441.36 --> 5444.96
like the arguments are what they are

5443.84 --> 5449.4400000000005
we've developed what

5444.96 --> 5450.88
we've developed that's not gonna change

5449.44 --> 5453.919999999999
maybe going to be a little bit more

5450.88 --> 5453.92
polished here and there

5454.32 --> 5463.84
that's it

5468.639 --> 5474.84
in the sense that by then there may be

5471.88 --> 5477.92
sub-orbital flights

5474.84 --> 5481.04
sub-orbital oh so you mean

5477.92 --> 5483.92
very high flights that's

5481.04 --> 5486.48
that's nice it's not going to prove the

5483.92 --> 5491.679
globe though

5486.48 --> 5493.12
moon landings oh sure sure there will be

5491.679 --> 5496.32
that that's going to be great man

5493.12 --> 5498.08
because everybody's telescopes

5496.32 --> 5499.5199999999995
it's going to be aimed at that freaking

5498.08 --> 5502.719
moon

5499.52 --> 5507.52
and then cross-reference with the

5502.719 --> 5509.28
aimed location of the landing supposedly

5507.52 --> 5511.040000000001
and because there's a lot of nerds now

5509.28 --> 5512.0
that know exactly where that's supposed

5511.04 --> 5513.679
to be

5512.0 --> 5516.48
and then you really think that you're

5513.679 --> 5518.4
gonna see the details of that on great

5516.48 --> 5533.839999999999
telescopes on the moon

5518.4 --> 5533.839999999999
i don't think so

5536.8 --> 5541.4400000000005
but who knows maybe maybe they're going

5538.56 --> 5546.0
to claim like a secret moon landing like

5541.44 --> 5548.32
do it in secret the secret space program

5546.0 --> 5550.159
and then showed like yeah we managed to

5548.32 --> 5552.48
do it but we had to keep it a secret

5550.159 --> 5554.48
because of

5552.48 --> 5556.959999999999
because of the new world order or

5554.48 --> 5556.959999999999
whatever

5557.04 --> 5560.719
and then show you that so that nobody

5559.6 --> 5563.84
could aim

5560.719 --> 5567.28
their live telescopes

5563.84 --> 5568.4800000000005
to actually see it when it was happening

5567.28 --> 5570.239
i don't know maybe they'll go for

5568.48 --> 5571.759999999999
something like that but yeah who's going

5570.239 --> 5574.638999999999
to believe that anymore

5571.76 --> 5575.52
these days like people know about fake

5574.639 --> 5578.8
news

5575.52 --> 5582.159000000001
they know how far people go

5578.8 --> 5583.1990000000005
so will it even serve the same level of

5582.159 --> 5586.4
function

5583.199 --> 5589.839999999999
as it originally did because where

5586.4 --> 5589.839999999999
there's no trust

5599.6 --> 5603.04
like at this point even plenty of people

5602.239 --> 5606.5599999999995
that believe

5603.04 --> 5607.28
it would be possible if they would

5606.56 --> 5611.4400000000005
actually

5607.28 --> 5613.44
pull a trickery thing off like that

5611.44 --> 5616.48
then even the people that would believe

5613.44 --> 5619.5199999999995
it actually to be possible

5616.48 --> 5621.199
are likely to still have doubts whether

5619.52 --> 5626.159000000001
it is real or not and not just

5621.199 --> 5628.0
trick because we're going there as well

5626.159 --> 5630.48
it's like yeah you can be made to

5628.0 --> 5633.44
believe that it is all possible

5630.48 --> 5635.599999999999
but you also know what kind of a world

5633.44 --> 5636.48
socially with other people we live in

5635.6 --> 5639.04
and how

5636.48 --> 5641.44
much they lie about things and how easy

5639.04 --> 5642.96
it is becoming technologically to fool

5641.44 --> 5644.879999999999
us

5642.96 --> 5647.04
at the same time it's also easier to

5644.88 --> 5647.4400000000005
inquire information and teach yourself

5647.04 --> 5649.679
on

5647.44 --> 5650.879999999999
how foolery works in order to spot it

5649.679 --> 5654.2390000000005
out

5650.88 --> 5658.719
so it's

5654.239 --> 5662.32
the times are changing

5658.719 --> 5664.159
moon landing spells are not gonna work

5662.32 --> 5673.84
the same

5664.159 --> 5673.839999999999
because it's a different age

5677.44 --> 5680.799999999999
on the other hand on mars it might be

5679.36 --> 5683.199
slightly

5680.8 --> 5685.679
easier because yeah that's further away

5683.199 --> 5689.839999999999
so maybe they're gonna try that

5685.679 --> 5693.28
instead the moon it's too close

5689.84 --> 5696.32
too many people have too good telescopes

5693.28 --> 5701.84
to see too close it's just

5696.32 --> 5701.84
they can't do that

5716.159 --> 5729.839999999999
right okay george sanford

5739.6 --> 5744.08
yes i appreciate that tiny wumble thank

5742.239 --> 5747.36
you very much

5744.08 --> 5747.36
genuinely appreciate that

5748.56 --> 5753.04
but yeah the moon landing is just it's

5751.199 --> 5754.719
it can't function the same way because

5753.04 --> 5758.56
the technology is

5754.719 --> 5762.08
makes it impossible can't be tricked

5758.56 --> 5763.84
anymore but who knows maybe they'll go

5762.08 --> 5771.84
do some mars thing or whatever

5763.84 --> 5771.84
anyway i'll be back in two minutes

5868.239 --> 5870.48
you

5871.6 --> 5874.96
or mars makes no difference now it does

5873.679 --> 5878.0
make a difference because

5874.96 --> 5880.159
mars like

5878.0 --> 5882.4
with the technology that is out there

5880.159 --> 5883.759999999999
people still are will not be able to

5882.4 --> 5888.879999999999
zoom on

5883.76 --> 5888.88
zoom in on it enough to figure out

5890.239 --> 5894.239
that there's nothing happening on the

5891.84 --> 5897.52
surface of it

5894.239 --> 5900.239
see with the moon there's just so much

5897.52 --> 5903.280000000001
more detail visible to

5900.239 --> 5906.48
the technology that's out there there's

5903.28 --> 5908.0
lenses and everything that

5906.48 --> 5911.119
people will figure out that's just

5908.0 --> 5913.92
nothing happening

5911.119 --> 5915.28
well with mars it's much smaller so it's

5913.92 --> 5918.96
it's going to be a whole different

5915.28 --> 5921.28
range you know

5918.96 --> 5923.52
you're going to have to have a seriously

5921.28 --> 5924.5599999999995
expensive telescope to even be able to

5923.52 --> 5928.639
see

5924.56 --> 5928.639
more detail about it in the first place

5936.159 --> 5942.48
yes george sanford i heard and also

5939.679 --> 5944.96
remember the crashed

5942.48 --> 5946.879999999999
landing the crash landing from israel

5944.96 --> 5953.84
with their digital representation that

5946.88 --> 5953.84
supposedly happened as well

6039.04 --> 6041.36
what

6047.679 --> 6051.92
george sanford like elon musk is gonna

6051.44 --> 6056.159
put a

6051.92 --> 6056.159
cgi bass on the moon

6057.119 --> 6060.96
well animations for that sort of thing

6059.52 --> 6063.1990000000005
are around plenty even

6060.96 --> 6065.6
with mars and all that so they got the

6063.199 --> 6068.879999999999
cgi already

6065.6 --> 6072.4800000000005
but i don't think any of that is ever

6068.88 --> 6072.4800000000005
going to be officially claimed

6075.6 --> 6093.84
it's just a big cgi fantasy

6079.28 --> 6093.84
carried on a stick

6100.719 --> 6106.8
what do you mean rubbish soon

6104.159 --> 6108.08
as the moon is mentioned we all go nuts

6106.8 --> 6121.84
what

6108.08 --> 6121.84
what are you talking about

6135.76 --> 6139.319
[Music]

6146.719 --> 6151.52
i i don't understand what you're saying

6149.04 --> 6151.5199999999995
ravage

6156.239 --> 6162.718999999999
if you were saying incompletely

6159.6 --> 6164.8
when the moon landing is mentioned we'll

6162.719 --> 6167.679
go nuts yeah i get that but

6164.8 --> 6168.320000000001
the moon no people don't go nuts of just

6167.679 --> 6170.56
hearing

6168.32 --> 6171.679
the moon don't know where you're getting

6170.56 --> 6174.320000000001
that from

6171.679 --> 6176.159
and i don't know what the moon what's so

6174.32 --> 6179.84
stupid about it

6176.159 --> 6184.638999999999
so anyway hey tara 306

6179.84 --> 6184.639
and steamy traveler late

6185.76 --> 6191.84
but well better late than never

6207.92 --> 6211.119
talk shows neil armstrong is on talk

6210.4 --> 6219.839999999999
shows

6211.119 --> 6219.839999999999
is he

6228.4 --> 6233.839999999999
but wait what

6251.679 --> 6256.4
yeah jim carrey i thought i recognized

6255.119 --> 6261.839999999999
it yeah

6256.4 --> 6261.839999999999
he said that

6284.48 --> 6288.32
that's true no joke wait so wait hold on

6287.679 --> 6290.719
did

6288.32 --> 6291.679
jim carrey literally say that entire

6290.719 --> 6294.56
thing if you're

6291.679 --> 6296.2390000000005
quoting somebody else it would be good

6294.56 --> 6298.639
to put quotes around it

6296.239 --> 6301.44
so that i know if you're just saying

6298.639 --> 6304.08
something random and like oh yeah

6301.44 --> 6305.44
something i said before somebody

6304.08 --> 6308.48
literally says yeah that's

6305.44 --> 6312.96
really not very specific

6308.48 --> 6315.04
so you mean that he said as an entirety

6312.96 --> 6316.4800000000005
you know people run out of things to say

6315.04 --> 6318.88
so they start to make

6316.48 --> 6320.48
stuff up like that new armstrong guy

6318.88 --> 6325.04
have you seen him on talk shows

6320.48 --> 6325.04
is that literally a quotation

6325.84 --> 6334.400000000001
you see that's why it's good if you're

6329.36 --> 6334.4
quoting somebody you use quotes

6337.44 --> 6345.839999999999
and i'm asking by the way is that

6339.28 --> 6345.84
specifically what he was saying

6347.199 --> 6350.638999999999
right okay

6352.0 --> 6355.52
that's a pretty good joke by the way i

6356.84 --> 6359.84
think

6379.76 --> 6383.4400000000005
right so tear it next time

6383.92 --> 6387.84
use the quotation marks please

6388.0 --> 6394.56
i would really appreciate that if you

6390.88 --> 6394.56
put in that little extra effort

6397.4 --> 6401.839999999999
specificity is a virtue

6407.199 --> 6415.839999999999
don't have to be sorry i'm just saying

6419.36 --> 6424.5599999999995
the restaurants and mood great food

6421.36 --> 6424.5599999999995
terrible atmospheres

6425.04 --> 6443.84
they did didn't have a pressurized room

6428.639 --> 6443.84
that sucks

6454.84 --> 6457.84
hmm

6468.84 --> 6471.84
so

6482.84 --> 6485.84
so

6485.92 --> 6493.119
you know what the weird thing is about

6489.36 --> 6495.839999999999
when i'm silent a lot it's that it's

6493.119 --> 6498.719
really pleasant to me but then i

6495.84 --> 6501.119000000001
realized like [ __ ] there's not a lot

6498.719 --> 6502.88
going and then i feel guilty and then it

6501.119 --> 6506.32
ruins it a little

6502.88 --> 6507.119
well in comparison the times when i do a

6506.32 --> 6509.599999999999
show and i'm

6507.119 --> 6510.799999999999
really caught up in something usually

6509.6 --> 6514.159000000001
involves some kind of

6510.8 --> 6518.08
anguish or dissatisfaction then i'm

6514.159 --> 6519.199
act as active as [ __ ] and i can't stop

6518.08 --> 6521.6
talking and i get

6519.199 --> 6522.4
really serious and even emotional and

6521.6 --> 6525.52
all that but

6522.4 --> 6526.799999999999
definitely always it keeps going but

6525.52 --> 6529.76
then

6526.8 --> 6530.639
this like this i'm like right i

6529.76 --> 6534.56
recovered some

6530.639 --> 6536.32
from some very serious agitation and

6534.56 --> 6540.400000000001
disappointment and all that

6536.32 --> 6543.5199999999995
dissolution and now i feel like

6540.4 --> 6546.159
really calm and nice and like i just

6543.52 --> 6547.84
kind of want to just sit down and calm

6546.159 --> 6550.96
down and just

6547.84 --> 6554.32
relax but then i become

6550.96 --> 6556.4
very content with just not

6554.32 --> 6558.0
really being active it's like oh i have

6556.4 --> 6561.5199999999995
still mine

6558.0 --> 6563.52
like hmm i should be actively

6561.52 --> 6567.1990000000005
entertaining

6563.52 --> 6569.84
but but it feels so nice just sitting

6567.199 --> 6569.839999999999
there

6572.239 --> 6576.239
it's weird it's a bit of a conflict but

6575.199 --> 6582.719
i guess that i i

6576.239 --> 6586.0
am doing all right

6582.719 --> 6589.04
and sometimes it's also though because

6586.0 --> 6590.88
people do kind of not blaming you

6589.04 --> 6592.159
okay so don't take this over please

6590.88 --> 6594.88
don't apologize

6592.159 --> 6596.0
when i do this thing it's just that

6594.88 --> 6598.8
people dragging

6596.0 --> 6600.8
pretty dark moods in here too with the

6598.8 --> 6603.84
subjects they forward

6600.8 --> 6606.08
they kind of do that and then

6603.84 --> 6607.92
sometimes i'm just contemplating on not

6606.08 --> 6611.5199999999995
responding because i don't

6607.92 --> 6614.2390000000005
really want to grab a hold of that

6611.52 --> 6615.119000000001
and then get on that darkness level and

6614.239 --> 6617.44
trying to

6615.119 --> 6619.28
explain and just because i don't want to

6617.44 --> 6621.119
get dragged in there again i stepped

6619.28 --> 6622.5599999999995
away from it on purpose

6621.119 --> 6624.88
but it's something that people are

6622.56 --> 6629.04
preoccupied with

6624.88 --> 6630.88
it's difficult and then often i also

6629.04 --> 6631.92
kind of turn quiet even though something

6630.88 --> 6634.2390000000005
is said that

6631.92 --> 6635.92
could definitely be responded to and

6634.239 --> 6637.759999999999
probably people that will read that chat

6635.92 --> 6639.92
is like oh yeah that subject that

6637.76 --> 6643.119000000001
subject that's and i'm like

6639.92 --> 6645.119
i don't want to talk about it

6643.119 --> 6647.36
and then i'm just slowly figuring out

6645.119 --> 6651.598999999999
like but maybe i have to

6647.36 --> 6655.598999999999
how do i do that and it takes some time

6651.599 --> 6659.599
before i can find a way to address it

6655.599 --> 6662.56
without ruining my own mood you see

6659.599 --> 6663.119000000001
and it's not your fault you bring in

6662.56 --> 6665.1990000000005
here

6663.119 --> 6666.719
what you're being confronted with out

6665.199 --> 6669.759999999999
there

6666.719 --> 6673.119
it's normal it's just like school

6669.76 --> 6677.04
right so people

6673.119 --> 6680.08
children students bring with them

6677.04 --> 6682.48
what they got what they carry what what

6680.08 --> 6684.159
they've been confronted with what they

6682.48 --> 6687.678999999999
got from out there

6684.159 --> 6689.28
and then you get that you get it

6687.679 --> 6690.639
you have to deal with that as a teacher

6689.28 --> 6692.159
it's funny because i kind of paid

6690.639 --> 6695.04
attention to teachers

6692.159 --> 6697.5199999999995
in those situations i would be like sit

6695.04 --> 6699.5199999999995
sitting quietly

6697.52 --> 6700.56
not making a hassle as people were like

6699.52 --> 6703.119000000001
squirting

6700.56 --> 6704.8
not literally just being frustrated

6703.119 --> 6707.119
being triggered

6704.8 --> 6708.88
about something on the news or whatever

6707.119 --> 6710.639
and then

6708.88 --> 6712.0
and i had my own moments when i had that

6710.639 --> 6714.96
by the way

6712.0 --> 6714.96
just seeing how

6715.119 --> 6720.5599999999995
teachers would respond and not respond

6718.719 --> 6721.76
how that worked how they tried to deal

6720.56 --> 6723.04
with it and you could see it was

6721.76 --> 6724.88
difficult

6723.04 --> 6726.48
and in a way i'm trying to do that on my

6724.88 --> 6730.2390000000005
own as well it's like because i do

6726.48 --> 6732.0
want to help people deal with the [ __ ]

6730.239 --> 6732.879999999999
that's out there but at the same time i

6732.0 --> 6736.4
don't want

6732.88 --> 6738.719
it to rub off on me so that it'll

6736.4 --> 6739.839999999999
burden me as much as it burdens others

6738.719 --> 6743.52
because i want to

6739.84 --> 6746.0
get out of it and

6743.52 --> 6746.8
for me it's become important to kind of

6746.0 --> 6751.199
step away

6746.8 --> 6752.159000000001
as i said before the cremation a care i

6751.199 --> 6755.678999999999
have to stop

6752.159 --> 6756.0
caring as much and just because a lot of

6755.679 --> 6759.52
it

6756.0 --> 6763.28
is illusory it's a losery burden also

6759.52 --> 6764.0
much of it that is put out there for us

6763.28 --> 6768.639
to take on

6764.0 --> 6768.639
and it's just people get caught up in it

6770.239 --> 6774.718999999999
and i try not to but at the same time i

6773.84 --> 6777.92
can't just

6774.719 --> 6779.599
ignore everything either because people

6777.92 --> 6782.159
are dealing with issues

6779.599 --> 6782.159000000001
in the world

6788.88 --> 6794.56
well tiny wumbo yeah sure stepping

6792.0 --> 6795.199
away is healthy every now and then and

6794.56 --> 6798.639
some people

6795.199 --> 6798.96
are like on the internet i've noticed

6798.639 --> 6800.8
that

6798.96 --> 6806.159
that are like oh i can't deal with this

6800.8 --> 6808.96
[ __ ] anymore i'm out of here

6806.159 --> 6810.799999999999
like perfection in chat yesterday like

6808.96 --> 6814.719
for some reason i just

6810.8 --> 6817.4400000000005
told him or her i don't know

6814.719 --> 6819.04
like dude like you're always yeah you're

6817.44 --> 6820.879999999999
troll waiting

6819.04 --> 6822.48
and that wasn't even like going stop

6820.88 --> 6824.0
going at our criticisms just like

6822.48 --> 6826.0
pointing it out like and

6824.0 --> 6828.08
totally triggered and thought like oh

6826.0 --> 6830.08
just ban me and all that i'm out of here

6828.08 --> 6834.48
and i'm done with this [ __ ]

6830.08 --> 6836.239
dude you really need a break i wasn't

6834.48 --> 6838.159
even criticizing you

6836.239 --> 6839.598999999999
just saying like yeah you do typically

6838.159 --> 6842.239
do that just

6839.599 --> 6842.2390000000005
pointing out

6842.8 --> 6846.719
so some people do definitely have to

6844.32 --> 6850.08
step away every now and then

6846.719 --> 6854.08
but for me it's more like

6850.08 --> 6857.599
my empathy makes me typically

6854.08 --> 6859.76
latch onto something so that i

6857.599 --> 6862.96
literally just take somebody else's

6859.76 --> 6866.400000000001
burden as if it was mine

6862.96 --> 6869.52
well that is also very disruptive

6866.4 --> 6872.5599999999995
my empathy can like

6869.52 --> 6876.96
disrupt me if i just give in to it

6872.56 --> 6879.360000000001
fully see

6876.96 --> 6880.8
take it very close to heart take things

6879.36 --> 6883.44
very close to heart

6880.8 --> 6883.4400000000005
every time

6883.84 --> 6893.679
if i don't defend against that tendency

6890.48 --> 6896.48
all right anyway hey roger

6893.679 --> 6897.4400000000005
good to see you yeah i'm doing okay i'm

6896.48 --> 6905.839999999999
pretty

6897.44 --> 6905.839999999999
yeah pretty relaxed at this moment

6906.0 --> 6909.52
hey more colored good to see you don't

6908.48 --> 6918.08
see you in chat

6909.52 --> 6921.1990000000005
that often anymore

6918.08 --> 6923.04
yeah thanks for popping by

6921.199 --> 6926.96
how about our government just that they

6923.04 --> 6926.96
did they actually did it

6927.76 --> 6931.599
i wasn't sure if it was gonna be real or

6931.119 --> 6934.4
not

6931.599 --> 6934.400000000001
so the dough

6936.56 --> 6940.639
oh jay why couldn't you have just come

6939.04 --> 6942.08
in like two hours ago

6940.639 --> 6944.88
then i would have filled up the whole

6942.08 --> 6947.84
show with that probably

6944.88 --> 6947.84
but that's interesting

6951.28 --> 6955.199
i wonder where it's going to go you know

6952.88 --> 6956.2390000000005
it could take a dramatic turn for the

6955.199 --> 6961.199
worse

6956.239 --> 6964.638999999999
like it could be that

6961.199 --> 6968.239
they didn't want to be responsible

6964.639 --> 6971.52
for implementing the tyranny

6968.239 --> 6973.199
that is going to be implemented and that

6971.52 --> 6974.8
we're all like oh finally they're out of

6973.199 --> 6975.919999999999
here because they're the ones that want

6974.8 --> 6978.159000000001
to implement it

6975.92 --> 6979.119
it could just be that the next group is

6978.159 --> 6988.719
going to

6979.119 --> 6991.839999999999
do it even worse you know

6988.719 --> 6994.4
very wary of that it's like who

6991.84 --> 6995.92
like whoever is going to be put on that

6994.4 --> 6999.839999999999
top

6995.92 --> 7002.159
it's like is it even possible even

6999.84 --> 7003.159000000001
to have an active government anymore

7002.159 --> 7006.638999999999
without it

7003.159 --> 7010.239
immediately being blackmailed

7006.639 --> 7011.04
immediately blackmailed into becoming

7010.239 --> 7014.5599999999995
part

7011.04 --> 7017.84
of the same [ __ ] over and over again

7014.56 --> 7017.84
you see

7019.52 --> 7024.159000000001
so maybe that the government just has to

7021.679 --> 7026.719
stay off for a while like that

7024.159 --> 7029.199
to avoid it maybe that's the only way

7026.719 --> 7031.119
out i don't know

7029.199 --> 7033.839999999999
but yeah interesting to hear that they

7031.119 --> 7037.199
actually did it

7033.84 --> 7038.96
right so i guess i'll get back to that

7037.199 --> 7041.759999999999
on tomorrow's show because i am going to

7038.96 --> 7041.76
round out the show

7042.32 --> 7049.119
i hope to dude roger just

7046.4 --> 7051.36
if you please if you can't be on my show

7049.119 --> 7051.839999999999
early tomorrow and let's talk about this

7051.36 --> 7053.759999999999
stuff

7051.84 --> 7056.0
you probably read into it a lot more

7053.76 --> 7059.84
than i have

7056.0 --> 7059.84
right so it would be cool

7060.159 --> 7065.44
to actually address this as a subject

7062.96 --> 7068.4
tomorrow

7065.44 --> 7069.5199999999995
and you can be in chat if you want to we

7068.4 --> 7072.08
can do it

7069.52 --> 7073.52
you we can do it over skype or anything

7072.08 --> 7076.88
if you think you got enough

7073.52 --> 7078.719
input to do that but we'll see but yeah

7076.88 --> 7079.4400000000005
definitely a subject that i will address

7078.719 --> 7081.119
i didn't

7079.44 --> 7083.598999999999
know for certain if it was actually

7081.119 --> 7085.119
going to happen with all the letdowns

7083.599 --> 7087.1990000000005
thought yeah yeah it's just another

7085.119 --> 7089.598999999999
[ __ ] thing right

7087.199 --> 7092.32
it's just more squirting but i guess it

7089.599 --> 7092.32
really happened

7093.599 --> 7099.04
interesting so i'll get back to you all

7097.44 --> 7100.5599999999995
about that tomorrow i'm probably not

7099.04 --> 7102.48
gonna address that on the flat earth

7100.56 --> 7103.92
debate unless they'll ask me about it

7102.48 --> 7105.759999999999
who knows

7103.92 --> 7108.2390000000005
they probably didn't even know they

7105.76 --> 7108.2390000000005
don't know

7108.639 --> 7112.400000000001

7110.32 --> 7115.28
okay okay i'll remember that

7112.4 --> 7117.36

7115.28 --> 7120.08
on skype because

7117.36 --> 7122.4
i have to specifically open discord and

close it off or it'll drive me nuts when
