7.3 --> 38.5
[Music]

38.66 --> 48.75
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.69 --> 50.01
early-bird number 144 today I have fer

48.75 --> 56.25
guest with me Kyle

50.01 --> 57.599999999999994
but first weather report it's yeah it's

56.25 --> 62.94
a little bit of everything it's kind of

57.6 --> 64.29
cold and cloudy right now but in between

62.94 --> 66.21
there's a little bit of Sun here and

64.29 --> 73.26
there and a little bit of rain sometimes

66.21 --> 76.77
it's mixed what yeah plenty of Sun here

73.26 --> 85.47
and there so how's everybody in chat

76.77 --> 88.46
doing i CH am steve Voynich beer and

85.47 --> 88.46
skittles young

93.09 --> 104.94
michael roark stereos eek dust grain

99.46 --> 107.22999999999999
brown globe had no more good to see you

104.94 --> 109.83
righteous force hey righteous force

107.23 --> 112.66
thank you for that comment the other day

109.83 --> 114.7
wasn't yesterday for the youtube

112.66 --> 117.67
downloader that worked excellent

114.7 --> 120.88
so thank you so much for the software

117.67 --> 123.13
tip yeah i I managed to download a whole

120.88 --> 127.69
load of videos with that especially

123.13 --> 130.63
music videos so my favorite song so

127.69 --> 132.69
thank you so much now I have that music

130.63 --> 137.01
whether the internet go down or not

132.69 --> 137.01
makes me very happy

137.25 --> 150.0
Jordan alias nothing happening right so

146.25 --> 154.36
let me get to my guest

150.0 --> 156.61
hello I am I'm here did you where we

154.36 --> 158.41000000000003
don't have son Scotland we've never got

156.61 --> 159.519
son in Scotland so the weather reports

158.41 --> 163.239
the same every day is just raining

159.519 --> 165.19
constantly right yeah it's gone sure

163.239 --> 168.85
just nice trend then I'll start asking a

165.19 --> 171.43
few questions why should you want to

168.85 --> 173.07999999999998
reflect first upon the last oh yeah

171.43 --> 174.76000000000002
thank you for reminding me

173.08 --> 176.05
I can't remember the exact points I

174.76 --> 178.239
wanted to bring up but it doesn't really

176.05 --> 180.519
matter I'm just saying that perhaps

178.239 --> 183.459
didn't argue my point that absolute best

180.519 --> 185.019
I could the last time I was on here my

183.459 --> 186.459
apologies for that hopefully trying

185.019 --> 189.67000000000002
rectify any questions that I left

186.459 --> 190.93
unanswered at this time just do keep

189.67 --> 193.35999999999999
asking me because I'll get to the back

190.93 --> 195.37
are you sure yeah yeah absolutely cuz

193.36 --> 197.26000000000002
we're gonna ask you for the independent

195.37 --> 200.43
variable yeah actually I went waiting

197.26 --> 200.42999999999998
got one Wow

201.01 --> 204.82
well I just didn't know what you were

203.38 --> 206.65
asking for but I totally get it now I

204.82 --> 208.48
was I was just slightly confused when

206.65 --> 210.549
Nathan was asking for an experiment just

208.48 --> 212.73899999999998
to give you a context on how my thought

210.549 --> 214.48000000000002
process when he was constant harping

212.739 --> 217.0
give me an example of an experiment to

214.48 --> 218.47
prove gravity yeah he was pushing so

217.0 --> 220.36
well the thing is actually I was I was

218.47 --> 221.85999999999999
trying to answer the question my initial

220.36 --> 223.27
response was well let's go back to the

221.86 --> 224.58
start with the theory and not what I

223.27 --> 226.11
meant by that was

224.58 --> 229.11
let's go back to the first observation

226.11 --> 230.82000000000002
of gravity by Isaac Newton that's what I

229.11 --> 232.19000000000003
was trying to say and it was word for

230.82 --> 234.42
we're going to give him an example

232.19 --> 237.75
literally after that but he interrupted

234.42 --> 240.48
me again and so my issue was not the

237.75 --> 242.01
actual argument itself but how do I get

240.48 --> 244.14
it across without sending like I'm

242.01 --> 246.39
talking about something else that was my

244.14 --> 248.19
issue without there won't be a problem

246.39 --> 252.48
this I I'd like to respond to that you

248.19 --> 256.73
do realize though that Newton did not

252.48 --> 260.88
claim a hypothesis for gravity really

256.73 --> 262.86
quote you don't really need a hypo I

260.88 --> 264.71999999999997
don't I don't know were this obsession

262.86 --> 266.16
with hypothesis is coming from when

264.72 --> 268.20000000000005
we're writing a hypothesis to

266.16 --> 271.20000000000005
scientifically prove something and he

268.2 --> 274.14
specifically knew that and did not claim

271.2 --> 277.92
a hypothesis for gravity because he knew

274.14 --> 279.51
he couldn't do it that's that's fine but

277.92 --> 281.43
immune isn't we we don't have authority

279.51 --> 284.7
figures in sciences there's no but you

281.43 --> 287.46
were going to refer a serious

284.7 --> 291.12
oh yeah observation why I didn't know it

287.46 --> 292.65
I mean I wasn't gonna go and quote his

291.12 --> 295.08
material I was just gonna give the first

292.65 --> 296.669
example of an object relocating and in

295.08 --> 298.32
the atmosphere based off of this density

296.669 --> 300.51
and volume and that library as to how

298.32 --> 302.49
that coincides with gravitational theory

300.51 --> 304.2
and how it proves I wasn't a vertically

302.49 --> 306.69
gonna give an experiment that he

304.2 --> 309.84
performed I was just gonna use that but

306.69 --> 314.21
what you just described roughly and I

309.84 --> 317.13
understand that is a deduction based

314.21 --> 319.169
reasoning piece of reasoning a deduction

317.13 --> 322.11
and then a conclusion but that's not

319.169 --> 323.82
actually the scientific method that's

322.11 --> 326.84000000000003
deduction based reasoning can be

323.82 --> 329.76
empirical and if you have straight-out

326.84 --> 332.01
observations to back it up with a not

329.76 --> 335.59999999999997
just theory then you can potentially

332.01 --> 340.96999999999997
claim an empirical deduction but yeah

335.6 --> 340.97
that does not amount to scientific proof

341.85 --> 346.92
do you understand Hey I disagree it

344.94 --> 349.11
doesn't matter scientific deduction is

346.92 --> 350.82
how we observation and inference as you

349.11 --> 354.45
said last time that's exactly how we

350.82 --> 355.8
work in science no science uses the

354.45 --> 359.25
scientific method

355.8 --> 361.65000000000003
yeah it's talking [Â __Â ] yeah I know it's

359.25 --> 363.41
a procedure it's just the systemic

361.65 --> 366.84
observation measurement and experiment

363.41 --> 369.27000000000004
something that's a descriptive nature of

366.84 --> 372.96
what it entails but it's actually quite

369.27 --> 374.78999999999996
precise a theory is built on the

372.96 --> 377.64
backbone of observations and experiments

374.79 --> 379.35
is the theory is a philosophical concept

377.64 --> 382.11
there's no it doesn't have a physical

379.35 --> 384.90000000000003
entity but in order for something to be

382.11 --> 386.7
a true hypothesis and scientifically

384.9 --> 389.58
provable you have to follow a very

386.7 --> 391.2
specific procedure and you can describe

389.58 --> 394.85999999999996
this procedure in a certain way

391.2 --> 397.11
classified the steps but to actually do

394.86 --> 401.40000000000003
it you have to actually follow the

397.11 --> 403.56
narrow steps and in that one of the

401.4 --> 406.95
first things that comes up with gravity

403.56 --> 408.93
always is you can't vary it and thus you

406.95 --> 411.0
can't use it as an independent variable

408.93 --> 414.12
actually you cannot prove it

411.0 --> 418.2
no you can now you can vary all kinds I

414.12 --> 421.14
wasn't gonna get gravity itself you know

418.2 --> 423.36
sorry gravity itself is the concept it

421.14 --> 426.71999999999997
within that concept you can

423.36 --> 429.75
scientifically prove concepts cause it

426.72 --> 432.36
is ethereal it is not physical and

429.75 --> 433.92
natural it is a much more like divine

432.36 --> 436.38
antics but what it what's your point

433.92 --> 439.05
about is it to do I've been trying to

436.38 --> 440.58
prove a gravitational field which is

439.05 --> 442.05
good enough really that's that's in

440.58 --> 443.46
essence what we call gravity but what

442.05 --> 445.29
we're trying to dispute here is a force

443.46 --> 446.84999999999997
that's pulling things down you're saying

445.29 --> 449.07
there's no force doing that it's just

446.85 --> 450.87
objects doing it because of their

449.07 --> 453.06
density of volume and that's what I want

450.87 --> 455.22
to kind of focus on I think we're gonna

453.06 --> 459.29
get in caught up with now with science

455.22 --> 461.85
and my method look you were open to

459.29 --> 463.83000000000004
actual responses and this is the bottom

461.85 --> 467.1
line this is also why Nathan did what he

463.83 --> 468.71999999999997
did he just did it very roughly and you

467.1 --> 470.85
obviously weren't prepared for that he

468.72 --> 472.38000000000005
was basically laying out a prediction

470.85 --> 474.90000000000003
for the future that was what he was

472.38 --> 475.63
doing I understand that for you it's

474.9 --> 478.35999999999996
just like

475.63 --> 482.05
nuisance because you work hard that's

478.36 --> 484.24
okay but the points all still stand and

482.05 --> 487.17
everything I just described still stands

484.24 --> 491.56
and you can't use a deductive based

487.17 --> 494.44
piece of reasoning as a scientific proof

491.56 --> 500.77
because it's not a scientific proof it

494.44 --> 502.18
doesn't follow the scientific method I I

500.77 --> 504.46
don't agree with you that that doesn't

502.18 --> 506.62
make any sense if that was the case no

504.46 --> 508.47999999999996
logical situation could be used in

506.62 --> 510.79
science because almost everything is

508.48 --> 511.36
function based off that's right doctor

510.79 --> 513.669
reasoning

511.36 --> 517.72
yeah but not everything has to fit in

513.669 --> 519.76
science where where's this assumption

517.72 --> 522.94
coming from like everything has to be

519.76 --> 526.78
scientifically proven why because the

522.94 --> 530.6700000000001
most reliable method we have because it

526.78 --> 534.4
is a trick because it is and did it in

530.67 --> 536.8299999999999
its definition it is about the physical

534.4 --> 539.62
world it's always in their physical or

536.83 --> 542.47
if it's just a concept and you can't

539.62 --> 545.29
manipulate it then it's not physical

542.47 --> 548.89
it's an aberration it's a side-effect of

545.29 --> 550.81
how things work you definitely use

548.89 --> 552.49
logical deductions when trying to form

550.81 --> 554.17
some form of conclusion and then the

552.49 --> 555.55
basis for a theory that I don't know

554.17 --> 558.52
where you're coming yeah but that's not

555.55 --> 561.1899999999999
science that's everything and I don't

558.52 --> 562.5
discourage deductive reasoning but it's

561.19 --> 564.4300000000001
not science

562.5 --> 565.96
I'm not saying deductive reasoning

564.43 --> 568.12
insight is science I'm saying the

565.96 --> 569.95
process the Bible the byproducts from

568.12 --> 573.84
the deductive reasoning applied to a

569.95 --> 576.76
concept in reality in science is called

573.84 --> 578.5600000000001
it is considered scientific that's how

576.76 --> 582.43
we draw theories and conclusion that's a

578.56 --> 588.5799999999999
local application of the word not the

582.43 --> 592.66
actual correct use of the terminology do

588.58 --> 597.2800000000001
you understand no then you need to look

592.66 --> 601.87
back into that because it's true it's it

597.28 --> 606.55
delves into the cultural colloquial use

601.87 --> 609.1
of science as a field it's not it's a

606.55 --> 612.7299999999999
method and everything that abides

609.1 --> 615.28
by that method is scientific and if

612.73 --> 618.25
there are some consensus or some piece

615.28 --> 621.27
of conceptual reasoning that everybody

618.25 --> 624.01
agrees upon that doesn't make it science

621.27 --> 625.87
I'm not saying is it pseudoscience it

624.01 --> 627.49
makes it conceptual and that's very

625.87 --> 630.78
interesting and sometimes it can be

627.49 --> 634.45
precision really be proven in some way

630.78 --> 636.5799999999999
physically eventually but it isn't so

634.45 --> 640.09
it's presuppositional presumptuous

636.58 --> 642.37
that's also not science that is also

640.09 --> 644.08
conceptual I can agree with the point

642.37 --> 646.27
that there is no such thing as this well

644.08 --> 648.13
you can have a scientific consensus but

646.27 --> 650.02
that itself is not scientific I agree

648.13 --> 651.34
with that statement I'm the only reason

650.02 --> 652.6899999999999
anyone would ever use a scientific

651.34 --> 655.6
consensus is just to see what the

652.69 --> 657.73
general opinion is but but that is what

655.6 --> 660.58
you're not but that's what you're

657.73 --> 663.46
resting on when you declare things like

660.58 --> 665.5
what you described science just what

663.46 --> 667.9200000000001
you've reasoning I used to think that

665.5 --> 671.53
was science as well it's incorrect

667.92 --> 676.54
it's a watered down version of what it

671.53 --> 682.18
is the method the so ultra reliable hard

676.54 --> 685.12
method it's very little thing and so

682.18 --> 688.5699999999999
everything just went on from that and

685.12 --> 690.82
became oh yeah let me ask you the real

688.57 --> 692.8000000000001
scientists that first started to use

690.82 --> 695.38
this started to turn into priests

692.8 --> 697.0899999999999
because they had so much grip over

695.38 --> 698.29
reality is so much understanding

697.09 --> 700.0
compared to everybody else that

698.29 --> 702.31
everybody else you started to lean on

700.0 --> 706.39
them as priests and so they watered down

702.31 --> 709.18
their own method and it became more like

706.39 --> 713.08
a church in that sense woven into

709.18 --> 717.31
society using schools universities and

713.08 --> 719.08
libraries as yeah I wouldn't agree it's

717.31 --> 721.3
not comparison because it churches a

719.08 --> 723.3100000000001
rigorous set of idealistic beliefs that

721.3 --> 724.87
have not they're not supposed to change

723.31 --> 727.75
all those in some religions like today's

724.87 --> 731.02
in they do change yeah exactly so in

727.75 --> 734.56
science as this the opposite principle

731.02 --> 736.24
in science it constantly evolved all

734.56 --> 739.65
religions are rigid and there's often

736.24 --> 742.0
split offs that start to do new things

739.65 --> 742.51
but there's a key point none of the

742.0 --> 744.43
religion

742.51 --> 746.26
promotive just as well as science

744.43 --> 748.87
promotes the science always promotes

746.26 --> 753.21
skeptical inquiry always promotes said

748.87 --> 757.2
Wow religions promote vigilance and

753.21 --> 759.85
strictness and forces other type of

757.2 --> 761.9200000000001
behavior so I think the issue is is that

759.85 --> 765.0400000000001
religion is such a broad term it can

761.92 --> 767.02
apply to so many things that what I'm

765.04 --> 768.16
referring to or the main kind of when

767.02 --> 769.51
you when you compare something to a

768.16 --> 771.4
religion people more often than not

769.51 --> 773.68
think of the big religions that

771.4 --> 775.93
Christianity and Islam and the thing is

773.68 --> 777.37
when you look at those the ideas are

775.93 --> 779.0799999999999
rigorous there's a set of Ten

777.37 --> 780.82
Commandments there's a set of ten rules

779.08 --> 783.25
there's a set of this than the other you

780.82 --> 787.8100000000001
cannot dispute that right well it would

783.25 --> 790.39
be bad but that doesn't glow and all the

787.81 --> 792.4899999999999
scientists and factors have this very

790.39 --> 796.54
specifically and we've played this to it

792.49 --> 798.88
in detail for years now years every day

796.54 --> 801.16
you can wean it back to our discussion

798.88 --> 804.04
about the scientific method if you have

801.16 --> 810.01
is one of the religious foundations and

804.04 --> 812.92
gravity the the physicality the yeah the

810.01 --> 816.75
concept of gravity assumed as a actual

812.92 --> 820.63
physical force those things are

816.75 --> 825.52
fundaments of the heliocentric religion

820.63 --> 827.62
sign scientism religion and it's a it's

825.52 --> 832.03
a religion that's not any open it's not

827.62 --> 835.0600000000001
open about being a religion secret Brian

832.03 --> 837.3399999999999
kept secret to those who believe it can

835.06 --> 838.8399999999999
we get back to the main point you wanted

837.34 --> 842.71
to talk about well not you want says you

838.84 --> 844.3000000000001
were talk or no pardon me I had to make

842.71 --> 846.73
up a breakfast that's how you were

844.3 --> 848.89
speaking of deductive reasoning yes I do

846.73 --> 851.53
it a lot but say I have a hypothesis

848.89 --> 853.0
mm-hm and I have an experiment you can

851.53 --> 853.78
pick any experiment you want that

853.0 --> 855.4
doesn't matter

853.78 --> 860.3199999999999
how do you draw a conclusion from that

855.4 --> 863.91
hypothesis well depends on what you're

860.32 --> 866.98
trying to prove it usually involves

863.91 --> 868.51
getting an independent variable which

866.98 --> 870.07
there must be the thing you're trying to

868.51 --> 873.5
prove and then find a way to manipulate

870.07 --> 875.63
it in in the proper setting with the

873.5 --> 877.91
no hypothesis and everything I'm not an

875.63 --> 881.15
expert to the actual oh yeah you're

877.91 --> 884.39
absolutely right what I do get what how

881.15 --> 889.16
basic it is and how rigid it is so yeah

884.39 --> 891.05
that's what you what you can do and if

889.16 --> 894.23
you think you're trying to prove remains

891.05 --> 900.14
conceptual and deductive and you can't

894.23 --> 902.69
actually find it oh it doesn't work out

900.14 --> 903.92
but hold on a second yeah I think I

902.69 --> 906.47
understand what you're trying to get at

903.92 --> 908.4799999999999
but hold on a second you're saying that

906.47 --> 909.83
because gravity is a concept but what I

908.48 --> 911.78
meant by gravity is a concept is that

909.83 --> 914.45
it's a large theory that has a large

911.78 --> 918.11
number of components I know you can

914.45 --> 919.5200000000001
examine the components using that method

918.11 --> 921.98
but you can't really examine all of them

919.52 --> 924.35
at once it just doesn't work what I

921.98 --> 925.52
meant was gravitational fields say on

924.35 --> 928.49
earth the last time we were having this

925.52 --> 931.31
discussion I should try variable and try

928.49 --> 933.41
to put yeah thing yeah let's go for it

931.31 --> 935.54
but before we go in there can I just ask

933.41 --> 938.15
you it will seem off-topic but you'll

935.54 --> 939.74
see exactly how this ties in just

938.15 --> 942.1999999999999
because of her central motion is I just

939.74 --> 943.88
want to ask you one question it's I

942.2 --> 945.5600000000001
don't know I don't know if you still

943.88 --> 948.3389999999999
remember Newton's laws of motion but I'm

945.56 --> 950.63
just gonna get you one specific law

948.339 --> 952.61
every object in a state of uniform

950.63 --> 954.65
motion will remain in that state of

952.61 --> 957.89
motion unless an external force acts on

954.65 --> 959.66
it right do you agree with that

957.89 --> 962.42
statement Philly yeah there's no

959.66 --> 966.23
friction all right yep general

962.42 --> 968.5999999999999
displacement from the I don't know if

966.23 --> 970.25
you remembered at the start of the last

968.6 --> 972.23
time I was on this string you stated

970.25 --> 973.37
that objects relocating based off of

972.23 --> 976.19
their density and volume in the

973.37 --> 978.05
atmosphere is simply a prospect of that

976.19 --> 980.33
material itself the reason it's doing it

978.05 --> 982.4599999999999
is just because it's an innate property

980.33 --> 983.75
of the material I think that's all right

982.46 --> 986.12
maybe that was close to what you said I

983.75 --> 989.27
can't totally remember you can correct

986.12 --> 991.37
me if I'm wrong why is there a force

989.27 --> 993.74
relocating objects in the atmosphere

991.37 --> 996.08
because we're observing a change in

993.74 --> 997.7
motion there must be a force no no

996.08 --> 1000.99
that's an assumption there must be a

997.7 --> 1003.2800000000001
force no it's just a relative density

1000.99 --> 1005.02
you're contradicting yourself no I'm not

1003.28 --> 1007.54
we already s you are we've already

1005.02 --> 1009.49
agreed that every object in a state of

1007.54 --> 1011.8
uniform motion remain in that state of

1009.49 --> 1014.2
motion unless an external force acts of

1011.8 --> 1016.51
it that's we're now observing something

1014.2 --> 1019.87
so the external force caused by the

1016.51 --> 1023.85
displacement of relative density the

1019.87 --> 1028.03
displacement of relative density yes

1023.85 --> 1032.589
that's not a force yeah it is provably

1028.03 --> 1036.24
so measure visa a librarian what you

1032.589 --> 1040.3899999999999
mean well when something displaces

1036.24 --> 1044.32
within the density spectrum finds its

1040.39 --> 1045.93
relative density equilibrium there will

1044.32 --> 1049.6599999999999
be displacement and this displacement

1045.93 --> 1053.8300000000002
will have caused forces to be applied

1049.66 --> 1057.0700000000002
just like accelerated motion and it is

1053.83 --> 1060.34
just like that but it is the

1057.07 --> 1063.81
displacement caused by the relative

1060.34 --> 1066.9099999999999
density inherent to the matter itself

1063.81 --> 1067.84
this sounds like you're saying is that

1066.91 --> 1069.7900000000002
sounds like what you're saying is

1067.84 --> 1071.5
there's a potential energy generated

1069.79 --> 1075.58
when you move an object outside of where

1071.5 --> 1077.53
it should be in this density right not

1075.58 --> 1079.78
big that's correct but that's not that

1077.53 --> 1080.86
doesn't prove that doesn't explain the

1079.78 --> 1083.44
origins of the force

1080.86 --> 1086.6799999999998
I just sounds it right but yeah there's

1083.44 --> 1088.54
always more origins this works it's

1086.68 --> 1091.1200000000001
scientifically provable so that's much

1088.54 --> 1092.74
more solid way to approach because you

1091.12 --> 1096.6399999999999
can actually scientifically prove it

1092.74 --> 1097.99
this way actually you can't show that

1096.64 --> 1099.7
actually this time because if you take

1097.99 --> 1101.71
that object whatever object it is you

1099.7 --> 1105.5800000000002
know a set of car keys in an environment

1101.71 --> 1107.77
filled with air will fall when you take

1105.58 --> 1110.08
that object over that atmosphere if you

1107.77 --> 1112.93
take it out of that condition and put it

1110.08 --> 1114.9399999999998
say in a vacuum it's still false

1112.93 --> 1116.47
it's not to do with the density of the

1114.94 --> 1119.2
surrounding materials although there

1116.47 --> 1121.18
really isn't it's a materials isn't it

1119.2 --> 1124.0
surrounded by defective chamber and the

1121.18 --> 1126.7
earth and everything else yeah it is it

1124.0 --> 1133.75
will still find its relative density

1126.7 --> 1136.03
level within the spectrum of things wait

1133.75 --> 1137.29
a minute what sorry I've said it's not

1136.03 --> 1139.93
surrounded by anything you're seeing a

1137.29 --> 1144.6
Destin yeah that's on him

1139.93 --> 1147.16
a vacuum is only much less dense air

1144.6 --> 1149.08
that's basically what it goes thank you

1147.16 --> 1151.27
ms anon exists it no but there's no

1149.08 --> 1153.76
perfect vacuum there never service tree

1151.27 --> 1156.28
exactly so there's always gonna be some

1153.76 --> 1158.95
air it's just very low density air it's

1156.28 --> 1162.07
still gonna displace it's just less it's

1158.95 --> 1167.05
like an object with theoretically fall

1162.07 --> 1169.78
faster when dropped in really high yeah

1167.05 --> 1171.7
upper atmosphere position because the

1169.78 --> 1173.59
air there because of the grading is much

1171.7 --> 1175.51
less than so it will have less friction

1173.59 --> 1178.1499999999999
on it it will fall faster well in a

1175.51 --> 1180.25
vacuum chamber it also falls faster it

1178.15 --> 1183.3300000000002
will still seek the object will still

1180.25 --> 1185.26
seeks it seek its relative density

1183.33 --> 1187.96
position where it will find its

1185.26 --> 1191.65
equilibrium until it has met it or is

1187.96 --> 1195.31
countered by a resisting force like from

1191.65 --> 1198.0700000000002
something solid if that was the case

1195.31 --> 1198.73
than the actual the the force applying

1198.07 --> 1200.4399999999998
to this object

1198.73 --> 1203.1100000000001
you agree there is a force right rights

1200.44 --> 1204.55
just as displacement reverses versity

1203.11 --> 1205.78
that's right we're not in this agreement

1204.55 --> 1207.19
that there is a force right that's fine

1205.78 --> 1210.1
we can put that point when there's

1207.19 --> 1212.7
motion of some kind yes we boarding

1210.1 --> 1215.32
sportings there is a force that's right

1212.7 --> 1216.7
right mostly so in other words what

1215.32 --> 1218.6799999999998
you're saying is it's not the variables

1216.7 --> 1221.38
here there is no variable for the mass

1218.68 --> 1223.1200000000001
the planet mind it will not affect how

1221.38 --> 1225.22
they stop that the mass of the planet

1223.12 --> 1228.07
will not affect how this object travels

1225.22 --> 1229.45
through these density relative density

1228.07 --> 1232.09
situations you see what I'm saying like

1229.45 --> 1234.6100000000001
I wouldn't know you tried to change the

1232.09 --> 1236.6799999999998
mass you can so it's just no but we have

1234.61 --> 1238.2099999999998
some similar reasoning we did we did

1236.68 --> 1240.3400000000001
actually take a set of pendulums up to

1238.21 --> 1243.39
the mid when we went there right well

1240.34 --> 1247.2099999999998
sorry I don't I don't consider that as

1243.39 --> 1249.43
yeah real I don't believe in the moon

1247.21 --> 1251.5900000000001
landing I don't believe you can go to

1249.43 --> 1253.5700000000002
any other place that's not that doesn't

1251.59 --> 1256.99
exist I spent so much time doing this

1253.57 --> 1259.6299999999999
last night um I'm sorry for you and just

1256.99 --> 1263.23
that falls under Helius in so the lease

1259.63 --> 1264.67
the hills believes it there's a set of

1263.23 --> 1267.94
retro fighters up there you know we can

1264.67 --> 1270.1000000000001
send a laser to them like this you can

1267.94 --> 1271.66
fire lasers at set retro flights just

1270.1 --> 1273.28
they left during the Apollo 11 mission

1271.66 --> 1273.8200000000002
is that the right you can fire your

1273.28 --> 1277.42
laser

1273.82 --> 1281.26
to the sky towards in an apparent moon

1277.42 --> 1283.1200000000001
an apparition that's nice and then yeah

1281.26 --> 1287.41
there may be something reflecting back

1283.12 --> 1289.9899999999998
but you don't know what and besides I've

1287.41 --> 1292.27
never really heard of anybody using that

1289.99 --> 1296.59
and then kind of proving that if you

1292.27 --> 1298.3899999999999
shoot like 10 degrees off blatantly not

1296.59 --> 1302.9499999999998
towards the moon that it would still

1298.39 --> 1306.5500000000002
reflect never had yeah you know never

1302.95 --> 1308.26
had straight up data to confirm that I'm

1306.55 --> 1310.87
assuming you've never worked with a

1308.26 --> 1312.79
retro of you trust me you would not get

1310.87 --> 1313.84
the same angle you wouldn't even get

1312.79 --> 1316.0
anything or flight they would just

1313.84 --> 1317.74
bounce right off right and then also

1316.0 --> 1319.48
it's not the same as the reflection for

1317.74 --> 1322.3
a retro flight right even if you could

1319.48 --> 1326.08
reflect something off of a presumed

1322.3 --> 1329.1599999999999
physical moon you know the distance

1326.08 --> 1332.35
you're going and all that atmosphere and

1329.16 --> 1337.3600000000001
yeah a moon surface is not just gonna

1332.35 --> 1340.06
straight out reflect a laser you know

1337.36 --> 1342.1299999999999
it's just like shining a laser on the

1340.06 --> 1345.8799999999999
ground is it gonna reflect all the way

1342.13 --> 1348.3100000000002
back to the moon no so yeah how are you

1345.88 --> 1351.73
gonna do that how are you gonna aim on a

1348.31 --> 1352.51
moon some kind of thing that's

1351.73 --> 1354.13
ridiculous

1352.51 --> 1355.75
it's not ridiculous it's the

1354.13 --> 1357.3400000000001
retroreflectors I told you this remember

1355.75 --> 1359.05
yeah and where is it how do you know

1357.34 --> 1361.51
where to aim it do you know how

1359.05 --> 1364.87
difficult it is to aim at like a million

1361.51 --> 1367.47
kilometers distance is something

1364.87 --> 1369.85
extremely small that's ridiculous

1367.47 --> 1371.92
no I wouldn't say it's ridiculous it

1369.85 --> 1373.2099999999998
it's actually not seemingly as difficult

1371.92 --> 1374.77
as you make it sound because people have

1373.21 --> 1377.05
done it and showing videos of them doing

1374.77 --> 1378.97
it right people proclaim don't do all

1377.05 --> 1382.3899999999999
that but look we've had people on

1378.97 --> 1386.59
YouTube claiming to do that just by

1382.39 --> 1388.3300000000002
pointing it and wise okay I remember

1386.59 --> 1390.1299999999999
somebody on the top what I think might

1388.33 --> 1391.75
even the Mythbusters who did this I'm

1390.13 --> 1393.0700000000002
prey sir and they did this as well I

1391.75 --> 1394.75
praise her loads of people have done

1393.07 --> 1397.96
this or one but they've done it on

1394.75 --> 1399.79
television yeah they've done this all

1397.96 --> 1401.5
that I didn't want that's not what I

1399.79 --> 1404.83
meant I just like everybody's literally

1401.5 --> 1406.11
done that in the media and the

1404.83 --> 1410.71
mainstream media

1406.11 --> 1412.84
all right that's great yeah I know

1410.71 --> 1415.33
they're very Pro scientism they believe

1412.84 --> 1418.2099999999998
climate change as well religiously

1415.33 --> 1420.75
oh god it's right so you disagree with

1418.21 --> 1425.53
climate change as well oh yeah

1420.75 --> 1427.3
absolutely absolutely can I just ask why

1425.53 --> 1429.85
what is it the convinced you of that

1427.3 --> 1434.29
position because man has very little

1429.85 --> 1436.1499999999999
influence on nature except by yeah man

1434.29 --> 1439.87
has influence on life because yeah we

1436.15 --> 1441.88
can screw up life with poison [Â __Â ] like

1439.87 --> 1444.3999999999999
chemical waste all that that's a big

1441.88 --> 1446.71
problem but as it when it comes down to

1444.4 --> 1449.47
basically gasses exerting them into the

1446.71 --> 1451.57
atmosphere there's barely any real

1449.47 --> 1453.16
problem except for the real toxins and

1451.57 --> 1457.27
we've worked that out in the last

1453.16 --> 1459.5700000000002
century so you were sorry and water and

1457.27 --> 1463.87
all that that's not bad

1459.57 --> 1466.6299999999999
plants crave co2 statistically proven

1463.87 --> 1468.52
that if there's industry near for

1466.63 --> 1471.66
example forests that the forests that

1468.52 --> 1474.91
have industry next to them with co2

1471.66 --> 1477.5500000000002
exits see you to production that those

1474.91 --> 1481.27
forests thrive as long as they are not

1477.55 --> 1483.9099999999999
being polluted by yeah whether the guys

1481.27 --> 1485.32
on the management of land basically as

1483.91 --> 1487.0900000000001
long as it's the ocean next - that's

1485.32 --> 1488.6799999999998
absorbing all the co2 causing it -

1487.09 --> 1490.0
certifying destroying the coral reefs

1488.68 --> 1493.66
yeah as long as that's the one that's

1490.0 --> 1497.11
that's ridiculous only happen if you're

1493.66 --> 1499.27
gonna directly pipe the co2 into the sea

1497.11 --> 1500.9199999999998
I know I was using that as one specific

1499.27 --> 1502.69
example what I meant was if you're not

1500.92 --> 1506.26
putting it if you're not pumping the gas

1502.69 --> 1508.18
straight towards the you know the plants

1506.26 --> 1510.79
they're gonna release it in the air it's

1508.18 --> 1515.3200000000002
just gonna spread out over the ground

1510.79 --> 1519.7
oh no it will acidify things water

1515.32 --> 1521.2
absorbs co2 aside from that I'm assuming

1519.7 --> 1523.3600000000001
I just go back to your example with the

1521.2 --> 1526.27
mankind doesn't have much influence over

1523.36 --> 1528.6699999999998
the total gases I've heard this argument

1526.27 --> 1531.43
before and what was presented me was

1528.67 --> 1533.2
somebody saying yo 97% of the co2 that

1531.43 --> 1535.93
sounded to the atmosphere is added by

1533.2 --> 1538.1200000000001
Nature and 3% is added by man but they

1535.93 --> 1539.41
didn't take into account was that's not

1538.12 --> 1541.09
the flux

1539.41 --> 1543.91
just that this is the total amount added

1541.09 --> 1545.8
and nature also takes co2 back out of

1543.91 --> 1548.53
the atmosphere that's right a lot of it

1545.8 --> 1550.33
well actually more than it adds usually

1548.53 --> 1551.8899999999999
the actual fact it takes out so much

1550.33 --> 1554.47
that it usually ends up taking out what

1551.89 --> 1554.92
we add so your point about because lying

1554.47 --> 1558.58
on it

1554.92 --> 1560.71
well it thrives to a point it needs it

1558.58 --> 1562.9299999999998
yes it's a requirement for life but much

1560.71 --> 1565.0900000000001
like hope plants need water if you not

1562.93 --> 1566.53
too much they don't need to be yet so

1565.09 --> 1568.5
don't mean yeah but that's never gonna

1566.53 --> 1572.59
happen

1568.5 --> 1575.17
there is so much plants out there okay

1572.59 --> 1578.59
and yeah we do we do need to keep on

1575.17 --> 1581.02
planting stuff but I think that all the

1578.59 --> 1583.36
co2 could be industrialized in the food

1581.02 --> 1587.73
industry but for example it is already

1583.36 --> 1591.04
being used certain type of growers so

1587.73 --> 1593.6200000000001
co2 is good it is a whole assumption

1591.04 --> 1596.1399999999999
that it's gonna change if the climate is

1593.62 --> 1600.76
ridiculous it's not ridiculously is

1596.14 --> 1603.0600000000002
ridiculous it's unproven it's not my

1600.76 --> 1607.81
dance every time a freaking volcano

1603.06 --> 1610.84
erupts okay it one freaking volcano just

1607.81 --> 1614.32
does a similar amounts of co2 eruption

1610.84 --> 1616.99
are as freaking humanity in a year I

1614.32 --> 1618.61
just answered that question look see the

1616.99 --> 1620.23
total amount of co2 the nature adds

1618.61 --> 1621.9399999999998
that's including volcanoes erupting

1620.23 --> 1623.8600000000001
that's including plants going crazy

1621.94 --> 1625.54
that's all balanced it's a component of

1623.86 --> 1627.76
the carbon cycle when volcanoes erupt

1625.54 --> 1629.56
the limestone tends to form form that

1627.76 --> 1631.51
the new the new minerals that were

1629.56 --> 1633.52
behind are stuck underground they they

1631.51 --> 1635.32
come back out because of the volcano and

1633.52 --> 1637.69
they do start to reabsorb co2 it gets

1635.32 --> 1639.37
taken back in there this is balanced

1637.69 --> 1641.02
this is all about what what's causing

1639.37 --> 1643.84
the problem is the fact they're pumping

1641.02 --> 1645.04
co2 into the atmosphere and not actually

1643.84 --> 1646.51
taking it back out when there's that

1645.04 --> 1648.1
with it you know you see somebody

1646.51 --> 1649.66
driving by in their Honda Civic there's

1648.1 --> 1652.03
nobody driving behind them taking the

1649.66 --> 1654.5800000000002
co2 back out but there's literally that

1652.03 --> 1657.25
happening whenever a plant dies when a

1654.58 --> 1659.1399999999999
plant dies more plants are growing those

1657.25 --> 1660.28
reabsorb the co2 that that plant give

1659.14 --> 1662.41
out when it's decomposing

1660.28 --> 1664.03
right that's that's a balance that's why

1662.41 --> 1665.5600000000002
that was the exact point I was trying to

1664.03 --> 1666.82
make with your argument people aren't

1665.56 --> 1668.11
taking into account the fact that this

1666.82 --> 1672.28
is all balanced and ninety seven percent

1668.11 --> 1673.06
figure is not a flux figure nature takes

1672.28 --> 1675.19
out more than

1673.06 --> 1678.4299999999998
then it puts it right so it's very back

1675.19 --> 1680.3700000000001
to standing on more force and [Â __Â ] oh

1678.43 --> 1683.95
yeah absolutely

1680.37 --> 1686.1999999999998
oh yeah my well we can both agree on

1683.95 --> 1689.23
that I'm sure that is a terrible idea

1686.2 --> 1690.88
because if you do that yeah then co2

1689.23 --> 1693.79
will but everything will become a

1690.88 --> 1695.5600000000002
problem but co2 because then the total

1693.79 --> 1695.92
amount of plant life can't handle it

1695.56 --> 1698.8
anymore

1695.92 --> 1703.98
it's critical that plants should be

1698.8 --> 1706.4199999999998
everywhere like especially in living

1703.98 --> 1707.17
living regions and I think that the

1706.42 --> 1710.14
Netherlands

1707.17 --> 1714.64
this city has kind of found a good

1710.14 --> 1716.44
balance between yeah yeah got you got to

1714.64 --> 1719.65
be careful of forest fires so you have

1716.44 --> 1722.68
to do a bit of them that's only big

1719.65 --> 1725.0500000000002
swaths of forest yeah yeah yeah finally

1722.68 --> 1727.15
we just have trees pretty much

1725.05 --> 1730.1499999999999
everywhere in between the buildings and

1727.15 --> 1732.88
everything that has a really that works

1730.15 --> 1733.3300000000002
out really well oh yeah trees are not

1732.88 --> 1734.74
the issue

1733.33 --> 1736.36
then funnily enough and this is a

1734.74 --> 1737.74
strange concept to entertain but the

1736.36 --> 1739.7199999999998
trees are not usually the issue when it

1737.74 --> 1741.58
comes to forest fires the issue is the

1739.72 --> 1744.88
dead shrubbery that they leave behind it

1741.58 --> 1748.36
right yeah it does really great it's

1744.88 --> 1750.88
good it's good work and it's satisfying

1748.36 --> 1751.87
oh yeah my only point was that that's

1750.88 --> 1754.0600000000002
the only time you should really be

1751.87 --> 1758.11
cutting anything down as if it's pretty

1754.06 --> 1759.55
much already dead but no maintenance but

1758.11 --> 1760.9299999999998
you your argument but the volcanoes

1759.55 --> 1762.55
figured did you find my argument

1760.93 --> 1763.75
convincing that that's balanced diet

1762.55 --> 1767.56
that doesn't mean anything

1763.75 --> 1769.62
that's not no I think to assume just

1767.56 --> 1774.34
because rocks have been found to absorb

1769.62 --> 1776.9199999999998
co2 back in that doesn't count up to the

1774.34 --> 1782.26
total amount that is actually exerted in

1776.92 --> 1783.79
the atmosphere totally disagree right

1782.26 --> 1786.16
but give me a second let me see if I can

1783.79 --> 1787.81
get you a proper source here um I wasn't

1786.16 --> 1790.0600000000002
really prepared for this no really they

1787.81 --> 1793.57
dug up like the entire region and

1790.06 --> 1796.84
measured it all no there's some and then

1793.57 --> 1799.06
just scaled it to their liking because

1796.84 --> 1800.83
you know to assume that it would all be

1799.06 --> 1803.7
absorbed again that just seems

1800.83 --> 1803.6999999999998
ridiculous to me

1805.06 --> 1812.24
[Music]

1809.68 --> 1814.1000000000001
besides most of that co2 is going to be

1812.24 --> 1815.78
hot and it's going to be injected pretty

1814.1 --> 1817.37
high up in the atmosphere so it's gonna

1815.78 --> 1821.45
spread out all over the place

1817.37 --> 1823.04
oh yeah no I I'm aware of that and that

1821.45 --> 1824.8700000000001
still causes issues even when it does

1823.04 --> 1825.92
that I mean there's a reason as to wind

1824.87 --> 1828.2299999999998
that the Earth's temperatures been

1825.92 --> 1829.79
increasing since we started pumping co2

1828.23 --> 1832.58
into the atmosphere especially since

1829.79 --> 1835.1599999999999
1980 it hasn't it's cooling down don't

1832.58 --> 1836.6
you know that no it's not yeah dealing

1835.16 --> 1839.72
down we're heading to a miniature ice

1836.6 --> 1843.1999999999998
age no or no the winters are incredibly

1839.72 --> 1845.57
cool it's snowed in freakin California

1843.2 --> 1847.49
okay again for the first time in 30

1845.57 --> 1849.53
years but I was to do with the polar

1847.49 --> 1852.35
vortex that wasn't to do it or you

1849.53 --> 1856.43
referring to something else right that

1852.35 --> 1858.32
wasn't to do if it's cold it's cold you

1856.43 --> 1860.69
know what it's also been record ly warm

1858.32 --> 1861.8
temperatures in summer the global

1860.69 --> 1863.3600000000001
temperature it's not just about what

1861.8 --> 1867.59
happens in California if it happens all

1863.36 --> 1869.9599999999998
over the place right well all I know is

1867.59 --> 1873.62
that parts of the Sahara are starting to

1869.96 --> 1877.4
green up actually that has been

1873.62 --> 1879.6799999999998
happening for some time yeah the climate

1877.4 --> 1882.5600000000002
changes it shifts but it has nothing to

1879.68 --> 1885.95
do with any type of gases we exert in

1882.56 --> 1887.12
the atmosphere it has every the 1980

1885.95 --> 1888.71
figure I was gonna give you solar

1887.12 --> 1891.53
luminosity has been decreasing since

1888.71 --> 1895.31
1988 and I can get you sources for that

1891.53 --> 1899.06
if you want receive it yeah so how is

1895.31 --> 1902.72
that gonna how's that gonna warm up the

1899.06 --> 1905.09
atmosphere because we doesn't make any

1902.72 --> 1907.03
sense don't you get it no it makes

1905.09 --> 1910.4599999999998
perfect no it doesn't make any sense

1907.03 --> 1914.09
all that data is there and it points out

1910.46 --> 1916.1000000000001
that it's cooling r1 listen to me so we

1914.09 --> 1917.54
just assume oh no it's the amount of

1916.1 --> 1919.6399999999999
solar radiation given off by the Sun

1917.54 --> 1921.29
it's not that's not the amount absorbed

1919.64 --> 1923.51
by us that's different

1921.29 --> 1925.82
what I'm saying is since 1988 was a look

1923.51 --> 1927.74
at a graph of world's temperatures solar

1925.82 --> 1929.3
luminosities been decreasing but the

1927.74 --> 1931.64
Earth's temperatures been increasing

1929.3 --> 1933.23
since then the only other thing that's

1931.64 --> 1935.48
been increasing that we can account for

1933.23 --> 1938.39
have been greenhouse gases things like

1935.48 --> 1940.25
methane co2 that's why people are saying

1938.39 --> 1943.19
that co2 is a greenhouse gas and is

1940.25 --> 1944.96
causing a rise in temperatures damson

1943.19 --> 1947.9
explain to me how it doesn't make any

1944.96 --> 1950.51
freakin gas gasses have to do with all

1947.9 --> 1953.21
this solar activity and what did you say

1950.51 --> 1954.98
so will our luminescence was less

1953.21 --> 1957.44
mineral but hold on

1954.98 --> 1960.71
luminosity whatever the light coming

1957.44 --> 1966.95
from it was less but we're absorbing

1960.71 --> 1970.6100000000001
more heat from it yeah that's yeah

1966.95 --> 1973.3
that's exactly what uh what how does

1970.61 --> 1975.5
that have anything to do with the gases

1973.3 --> 1976.97
because the gases of the reason as to

1975.5 --> 1978.41
why we're absorbing more they're called

1976.97 --> 1980.66
greenhouse gases for a reason they

1978.41 --> 1982.9
absorb heat better than the other stuff

1980.66 --> 1987.3200000000002
that's usually there that's the point no

1982.9 --> 1990.89
no the heat is absorbed when when the

1987.32 --> 1992.48
the sunlight hits solid matter well no

1990.89 --> 1994.49
because that's not that that's really

1992.48 --> 1996.65
far off reality there's no soap no no

1994.49 --> 2007.18
that's actually it's not really absorbed

1996.65 --> 2010.9
by the anti-discrimination Avast

2007.18 --> 2013.1200000000001
majority of it because air doesn't

2010.9 --> 2018.25
absorb it's transparent it doesn't

2013.12 --> 2021.3999999999999
absorb light not really you may it may

2018.25 --> 2025.05
absorb warmth coming from the earth but

2021.4 --> 2029.1100000000001
the whole co2 concept is that supposedly

2025.05 --> 2033.87
the yeah the heat absorbed by the

2029.11 --> 2036.4299999999998
sunlight of the earth would be yeah

2033.87 --> 2038.1999999999998
reflected back that's one of the

2036.43 --> 2042.52
theories that like the heat is reflected

2038.2 --> 2045.16
back or the sunlight is yeah whatever's

2042.52 --> 2048.48
reflect refracting back up is then being

2045.16 --> 2051.01
countered by this co2 look the entire

2048.48 --> 2054.19
concept all that graph all the ideas

2051.01 --> 2056.9500000000003
about is total horse manure it's total

2054.19 --> 2063.58
[Â __Â ] you should look into like the

2056.95 --> 2066.0699999999997
old global warming stuff that is the

2063.58 --> 2069.19
next version the same it's the same

2066.07 --> 2071.32
talking points the same system of

2069.19 --> 2073.87
arguments it's the same [Â __Â ] and

2071.32 --> 2075.32
they keep on changing everything every

2073.87 --> 2078.71
time some kind of hawkish

2075.32 --> 2081.2000000000003
and it never happens it's been recorded

2078.71 --> 2085.79
in history in the last 50 years this

2081.2 --> 2089.06
[Â __Â ] doesn't happen every time and to

2085.79 --> 2092.3
just bring out a new a new hockey stick

2089.06 --> 2097.31
graph nobody's bringing out in your

2092.3 --> 2099.59
hockey stick yeah they are okay yeah

2097.31 --> 2100.79
we're we've kind of gone off track from

2099.59 --> 2102.1400000000003
what I was talking about what I was

2100.79 --> 2104.14
saying was that the gases in the

2102.14 --> 2106.91
atmosphere are better absorbing light

2104.14 --> 2108.0499999999997
radiation than the original gases that

2106.91 --> 2110.3599999999997
would have been there prior to us

2108.05 --> 2111.65
pursuing the new ones there although

2110.36 --> 2113.84
it's really I say that if it's new ones

2111.65 --> 2115.4900000000002
it's just not fishing anything other way

2113.84 --> 2117.56
but it's still it's absorbing more gas

2115.49 --> 2120.8599999999997
more light sorry that's what I'm saying

2117.56 --> 2123.7999999999997
right according to that the gas would be

2120.86 --> 2126.05
absorbing more light so you say why do

2123.8 --> 2129.8
you fan then we would not receive as

2126.05 --> 2132.02
much we the earth itself the physicals

2129.8 --> 2135.4100000000003
beneath all that gas would not be

2132.02 --> 2137.18
absorbing as much heat and sunlight from

2135.41 --> 2139.22
the light because it has supposedly been

2137.18 --> 2141.3799999999997
absorbed by this year - is that what

2139.22 --> 2143.81
you're saying no what I'm saying is that

2141.38 --> 2146.2400000000002
the co2 absorbs a certain amount of

2143.81 --> 2147.83
light more than what it should that

2146.24 --> 2149.0299999999997
light still goes through it there's lots

2147.83 --> 2150.65
of light the cluster but there's lots

2149.03 --> 2152.8700000000003
get it I guess if it's being absorbed

2150.65 --> 2155.51
then it isn't being absorbed by the

2152.87 --> 2157.97
physical or one he thought again no it's

2155.51 --> 2160.82
not a perfectly value it's not a hundred

2157.97 --> 2163.31
percent absorption rate it's a saying

2160.82 --> 2165.17
that I'm saying decreased I'm not saying

2163.31 --> 2168.97
that we don't get any light pay

2165.17 --> 2172.2200000000003
attention please and be more specific

2168.97 --> 2176.0899999999997
right okay continue right so you claim

2172.22 --> 2178.3399999999997
that this year to absorb sunlight yeah

2176.09 --> 2181.88
well if it absorbs sunlight whatever

2178.34 --> 2184.33
percentage that may be then in

2181.88 --> 2188.81
accordance there must be less sunlight

2184.33 --> 2191.84
absorbed by the physicals by us and the

2188.81 --> 2195.5
earth beneath all that gas through which

2191.84 --> 2197.3
the light has to move right not

2195.5 --> 2199.28
necessarily it depends on the type of

2197.3 --> 2201.05
light that's absorbed take green plants

2199.28 --> 2203.0
as an example those plants are green

2201.05 --> 2204.4700000000003
because they absorb every wavelength of

2203.0 --> 2207.53
light except the one that's associated

2204.47 --> 2209.16
with green they reflect that light so it

2207.53 --> 2212.13
depends what light is being absorbed

2209.16 --> 2215.0989999999997
the co2 for example right so heat what

2212.13 --> 2217.289
type of light is being absorbed I didn't

2215.099 --> 2218.67
go check it's been too long since I've

2217.289 --> 2221.9300000000003
read this paper again like I didn't

2218.67 --> 2221.9300000000003
expect to get on to climate change today

2223.22 --> 2228.0
this might take me quite a while to look

2225.39 --> 2229.5589999999997
through I have there was a paper I was

2228.0 --> 2232.53
talking about earlier you were saying

2229.559 --> 2233.9700000000003
look at the first examples of papers in

2232.53 --> 2237.119
clay the first weekend examples in

2233.97 --> 2238.7099999999996
lately the early 1900's but this is the

2237.119 --> 2240.869
first proper one which started using the

2238.71 --> 2243.2400000000002
phrase climate change and it is

2240.869 --> 2244.65
available if you want I don't know if

2243.24 --> 2247.799
there's a chat here I can fit it in

2244.65 --> 2249.42
otherwise that's the paper there you can

2247.799 --> 2254.309
we do that your leisure if you want and

2249.42 --> 2256.859
that is that is the first paper that

2254.309 --> 2258.63
really draws attention this is one of

2256.859 --> 2260.8489999999997
the reasons as to why the IPCC's a thing

2258.63 --> 2267.869
I was nineteen fifty-six 1955 my

2260.849 --> 2270.839
apologies this could take hours for me

2267.869 --> 2273.329
to find out either way we'd ultimately

2270.839 --> 2275.52
depend on what the materials is above so

2273.329 --> 2278.13
if you have save something that's

2275.52 --> 2280.109
completely white this is reflecting most

2278.13 --> 2283.9700000000003
things like I know about light yeah sir

2280.109 --> 2283.97
option spectrum I know that very well

2284.63 --> 2290.7000000000003
my point is it depends on what is below

2288.029 --> 2293.48
it the exact if this is heat related

2290.7 --> 2295.319
then I take it absorbs infrared okay

2293.48 --> 2296.849
right mm-hmm

2295.319 --> 2297.869
well it will is or something for it well

2296.849 --> 2299.7000000000003
that doesn't mean that's the only thing

2297.869 --> 2304.4300000000003
that can result light in general can

2299.7 --> 2304.43
result in heat it's not just in for rent

2310.26 --> 2316.28
hello yeah well no I thought we thought

2314.19 --> 2318.54
we came down I need to find it again our

2316.28 --> 2320.0400000000004
people think that I just have a folder

2318.54 --> 2321.72
ingÃ©nue I asked filled with every

2320.04 --> 2323.43
scientific paper it would take quite a

2321.72 --> 2325.6189999999997
while for me to find out exactly which

2323.43 --> 2328.47
one we were asking for a needle in the

2325.619 --> 2330.81
haystack here Wow nice grab

2328.47 --> 2333.45
some kind of theory you better well know

2330.81 --> 2335.22
what it is it's impossible to know every

2333.45 --> 2339.95
facet of every detail to be prepared

2335.22 --> 2339.95
okay then you should be questioning

2342.17 --> 2347.46
manmade climate changes [Â __Â ] the

2345.21 --> 2351.65
worst we can do is poison the

2347.46 --> 2354.9900000000002
environment and decrease the amount of

2351.65 --> 2357.27
plants that exists I think that you have

2354.99 --> 2358.83
an unreasonably large requirement for me

2357.27 --> 2360.75
and no requirement of you your statement

2358.83 --> 2362.7
the volcanoes resort or release more co2

2360.75 --> 2364.32
the man does in a year I accepted that

2362.7 --> 2365.91
as a tree because I know it it's a

2364.32 --> 2367.9500000000003
correct statement had I asked you to

2365.91 --> 2369.81
back up that statement we have been an

2367.95 --> 2371.7
extra bleed for you to go and find a

2369.81 --> 2374.869
figure in the span of a live stream

2371.7 --> 2377.3999999999996
let's back that up would it not oh

2374.869 --> 2380.31
that's why I asked you to get the

2377.4 --> 2383.04
statistics on that but no but my point

2380.31 --> 2385.41
is is that there isn't it didn't seem

2383.04 --> 2388.5
very likely that it would absorb all of

2385.41 --> 2391.5
it that's just ridiculous

2388.5 --> 2393.54
no I explain it even yeah

2391.5 --> 2395.64
co t would be bursting out in the high

2393.54 --> 2397.8
atmosphere going all over the place so

2395.64 --> 2400.74
to assume that they would find the

2397.8 --> 2403.02
minerals in some location and they say

2400.74 --> 2407.3399999999997
oh it's all absorbed it just it's a

2403.02 --> 2409.59
ridiculous idea by itself it's no it's

2407.34 --> 2410.9700000000003
not not looking at one volcano and going

2409.59 --> 2412.38
okay here's the co2 from that let's

2410.97 --> 2413.7599999999998
track it and find where yes I'm sorry

2412.38 --> 2415.619
that's not what happens what they do is

2413.76 --> 2417.0
they look at the tapes sands doing

2415.619 --> 2420.3900000000003
deposits are the best example because

2417.0 --> 2422.04
they in order to form require co2 those

2420.39 --> 2424.08
forming takes you to out the atmosphere

2422.04 --> 2425.31
they look at the net amount of co2

2424.08 --> 2426.6
that's being taken out and then that

2425.31 --> 2427.89
amount that's being added then they go

2426.6 --> 2429.0
through the volcanoes they go right here

2427.89 --> 2432.72
isn't using the amount added roughly

2429.0 --> 2435.09
although here's here's the meticulous I

2432.72 --> 2437.43
went before since they all know exactly

2435.09 --> 2440.19
how much all of that is you don't need

2437.43 --> 2443.0099999999998
to know exactly yeah you do if you're

2440.19 --> 2444.52
actually deducing something from an

2443.01 --> 2447.3100000000004
actual object then

2444.52 --> 2448.84
you've got it you can't just wet finger

2447.31 --> 2450.52
work at all it's just weird

2448.84 --> 2452.4700000000003
nobody's the difference between knowing

2450.52 --> 2453.7
exactly the value and then wet finger

2452.47 --> 2455.47
working you don't need to know it's a

2453.7 --> 2457.18
tenth decimal place how much co2 is

2455.47 --> 2459.79
being taken out or added in but we can

2457.18 --> 2462.1
get a very reliable value usually at

2459.79 --> 2464.92
least from what yeah you mean an

2462.1 --> 2469.27
estimation and they're reliable factor

2464.92 --> 2470.92
is up for debate well if it depends on

2469.27 --> 2472.87
the methodology used to calculate the

2470.92 --> 2475.03
value which would be nice to have if you

2472.87 --> 2477.19
could give us some form of backing up

2475.03 --> 2479.6200000000003
for this the statement that volcanoes

2477.19 --> 2480.76
have more co2 to the atmosphere than the

2479.62 --> 2482.14
man doesn't yeah I agree with the

2480.76 --> 2484.42
position but if you could back it up

2482.14 --> 2486.1
with a paper or anything anything from a

2484.42 --> 2487.7200000000003
climatologist anything from a geologist

2486.1 --> 2490.12
to show the amount to show the

2487.72 --> 2492.7599999999998
methodology we would find out exactly

2490.12 --> 2494.89
what the kind of reliability of these

2492.76 --> 2496.36
figures are in fact since you're the one

2494.89 --> 2498.3399999999997
giving the values surely you should be

2496.36 --> 2500.05
most acquainted with the papers so

2498.34 --> 2503.76
placement let's see one let's see a

2500.05 --> 2503.76
methodology let's see how accurate it is

2504.78 --> 2510.1600000000003
methodology for what sorry getting

2507.76 --> 2511.57
distracted here you said that the

2510.16 --> 2513.1299999999997
volcano is the erupted

2511.57 --> 2514.3900000000003
or any volcano that erupts really

2513.13 --> 2517.42
because they're all they're all fairly

2514.39 --> 2520.0899999999997
large anyway so the amount of CO divided

2517.42 --> 2521.86
by X volcano is more than what man

2520.09 --> 2522.9100000000003
that's the atmosphere in a year now

2521.86 --> 2525.04
although I agree with that position

2522.91 --> 2527.2
you're making that statement I presume

2525.04 --> 2530.02
because you've seen that somewhere in a

2527.2 --> 2533.5
paper hopefully can you leave I'm not a

2530.02 --> 2535.66
paper reader but I yeah I'm a media

2533.5 --> 2537.52
follower and I've been looking into the

2535.66 --> 2541.0899999999997
concept of climate change you know that

2537.52 --> 2542.56
for 20 years so yeah I heard a lot of

2541.09 --> 2545.08
people out of there it's even a lot of

2542.56 --> 2549.13
presentations I don't remember all of

2545.08 --> 2551.23
them but my mind is set in this so can

2549.13 --> 2553.1800000000003
you give me a source for the statement

2551.23 --> 2554.7400000000002
that volcano has had more you co2 to the

2553.18 --> 2556.33
atmosphere in a year the man does that I

2554.74 --> 2559.4199999999996
can see the methodology and get you a

2556.33 --> 2562.38
you know some form of answer for the

2559.42 --> 2564.07
question of how reliable they are nope

2562.38 --> 2567.31
come on

2564.07 --> 2571.4500000000003
wow it's a very basic I was you're

2567.31 --> 2572.83
arguing yeah but I could say the same

2571.45 --> 2574.54
thing about the co2 thing is a very

2572.83 --> 2577.3199999999997
basic statement people agree that the

2574.54 --> 2578.85
fact that co2 absorbs more heat than

2577.32 --> 2580.23
most chemicals usually do they're found

2578.85 --> 2582.66
in the atmosphere that's why they act as

2580.23 --> 2584.52
a greenhouse gas they absorb they absorb

2582.66 --> 2587.64
lots of light I don't and the heat up

2584.52 --> 2589.41
because of it's not but you you're

2587.64 --> 2591.48
asking me to back that up but when I ask

2589.41 --> 2594.72
you to back so I'm trying to model it

2591.48 --> 2597.39
out like really if that's a statement so

2594.72 --> 2603.62
how would that overall effect everything

2597.39 --> 2606.33
just trying to figure it out right okay

2603.62 --> 2608.73
either way if you go and look at the

2606.33 --> 2611.61
actual papers the ones that you say you

2608.73 --> 2613.56
don't read yep you'll find out that the

2611.61 --> 2617.82
volcano eruptions they mean nothing they

2613.56 --> 2619.65
are balanced I'm right okay if you want

2617.82 --> 2622.4100000000003
to know how co2 impacts climate and how

2619.65 --> 2624.51
it impacts the temperatures of the globe

2622.41 --> 2626.0099999999998
and how it gets absorbed and stuff like

2624.51 --> 2627.4500000000003
that the paper that I linked you will

2626.01 --> 2629.01
cover that that's one of the first

2627.45 --> 2631.98
papers that was published on the subject

2629.01 --> 2633.51
before the IPCC was a thing before the

2631.98 --> 2635.31
government was involved in it massively

2633.51 --> 2637.0200000000004
before Margaret Thatcher made a

2635.31 --> 2639.27
presentation on it before anything like

2637.02 --> 2640.92
that happened that says as far detached

2639.27 --> 2649.05
from government involvement as you can

2640.92 --> 2652.4700000000003
get okay so right so yeah I still

2649.05 --> 2654.75
haven't had a Valentine we have this we

2652.47 --> 2662.1
have really had on you know we have

2654.75 --> 2667.26
really gone off at a tangent yeah you

2662.1 --> 2670.83
would be this this terrible oh okay yeah

2667.26 --> 2672.6000000000004
yeah climate change is really bad

2670.83 --> 2675.81
I mean hey listen I didn't think you'd

2672.6 --> 2678.12
be a you know an Apollo 11 hoaxer but

2675.81 --> 2679.2599999999998
hey we're all surprised I don't think

2678.12 --> 2683.43
you'd be that much of a conspiracy

2679.26 --> 2685.32
theorist well not particularly I just

2683.43 --> 2688.1699999999996
think the medium of outer space doesn't

2685.32 --> 2692.5800000000004
exist but that's that's quite a big

2688.17 --> 2695.96
claim to make our one I'd like to claim

2692.58 --> 2698.7
the contrary that was already claimed to

2695.96 --> 2701.67
assume all of that to be out there based

2698.7 --> 2704.3399999999997
on NASA and on a lot of science fiction

2701.67 --> 2707.55
work and an entire religion propelling

2704.34 --> 2710.88
that belief and visions and dreams about

2707.55 --> 2714.63
it well nobody actually goes up there

2710.88 --> 2716.6400000000003
and I is that yes I was assured isn't it

2714.63 --> 2718.529
I was pretty sure that a private company

2716.64 --> 2720.15
I can't remember the name off kind of

2718.529 --> 2721.799
this is one guy who was in charge of I

2720.15 --> 2723.599
still can't remember I'm Fraser and they

2721.799 --> 2726.24
sent something it's oh that's right

2723.599 --> 2729.299
SpaceX and Elon Musk yeah you believe

2726.24 --> 2732.0
you believe they actually shot a car up

2729.299 --> 2734.609
into the atmosphere I wouldn't put it

2732.0 --> 2737.25
past them but hey really nobody want you

2734.609 --> 2737.5789999999997
are you believe that yeah I don't see

2737.25 --> 2739.259
why not

2737.579 --> 2740.759
it seems perfectly reasonable I don't

2739.259 --> 2742.71
see why you can't put a lot we can fit

2740.759 --> 2743.88
satellites in low Earth orbit there's no

2742.71 --> 2745.38
reason you can't just Chuck a car even

2743.88 --> 2747.0
further there's actually an interesting

2745.38 --> 2750.119
concept because when people were trying

2747.0 --> 2753.589
to get rid of that they kind of the site

2750.119 --> 2756.599
product of nuclear I've seen the footage

2753.589 --> 2758.339
after you seen the footage oh no I

2756.599 --> 2761.2200000000003
didn't take the time to properly look at

2758.339 --> 2765.42
it but I've seen bits of it why should

2761.22 --> 2769.319
we look at it now no it's just my mind

2765.42 --> 2772.65
is blown that your yeah your suspense of

2769.319 --> 2774.029
disbelief is very strong and I can sense

2772.65 --> 2778.829
it from you and that you genuinely

2774.029 --> 2784.369
believe this and I'm a bit intimidated

2778.829 --> 2784.369
oh sorry I didn't mean to I'm not gonna

2786.349 --> 2791.9100000000003
he said they'll just go get him boys now

2790.109 --> 2796.529
I'm not gonna do that you know I just

2791.91 --> 2798.359
can't believe that it's her yet

2796.529 --> 2799.89
I'm a pretty large disbelief that you

2798.359 --> 2803.369
think that the Apollo 11 landings are

2799.89 --> 2805.14
hoaxes but hey you know I mean whatever

2803.369 --> 2807.9300000000003
we all reach to people with different

2805.14 --> 2810.029
viewpoints eventually right okay well I

2807.93 --> 2813.24
definitely recommend you to bring the

2810.029 --> 2817.14
footage or look at the footage of the

2813.24 --> 2819.6899999999996
Elon Musk car launch and hurry depends

2817.14 --> 2822.3289999999997
eventually there was left in orbit and

2819.69 --> 2824.849
study it and and maybe take a look at a

2822.329 --> 2827.309
couple of flyers or videos several

2824.849 --> 2829.559
people have made videos about this when

2827.309 --> 2831.599
it actually happened and then look at it

2829.559 --> 2835.3190000000004
and listen to their criticism I

2831.599 --> 2838.2000000000003
recommend you it to do this and just say

2835.319 --> 2840.329
load the globe or that then just just

2838.2 --> 2843.99
overlook that and just listen to their

2840.329 --> 2847.57
actual physical or related arguments

2843.99 --> 2850.99
just yeah you'll feel you'll figure out

2847.57 --> 2852.339
how ridiculous this entire thing was the

2850.99 --> 2853.7799999999997
only thing that I've ever seen the only

2852.339 --> 2855.04
videos I've ever seen on the SpaceX

2853.78 --> 2858.25
launch or anything along those lines

2855.04 --> 2859.93
have been Jaron ISM videos and see the

2858.25 --> 2862.359
interesting thing is that he covered it

2859.93 --> 2864.91
- yeah that's right well I don't know

2862.359 --> 2866.47
what offered it I don't want to I don't

2864.91 --> 2869.29
want to think you should go run into

2866.47 --> 2871.0
Jaron ism' he's a bit of a well I mean

2869.29 --> 2873.7599999999998
you saw what happened at the documentary

2871.0 --> 2875.89
that was quite that was quite sad to see

2873.76 --> 2878.1400000000003
somebody performing an experiment having

2875.89 --> 2879.64
their hypothesis proven to be contrary

2878.14 --> 2882.31
to their personal beliefs

2879.64 --> 2885.0989999999997
you mean edited out of context oh it

2882.31 --> 2887.02
wasn't and then you just cut it to make

2885.099 --> 2891.04
him feel yeah make him look ridiculous

2887.02 --> 2894.7
and and then play sad music over it yeah

2891.04 --> 2896.29
that that's very very much his fault

2894.7 --> 2898.5699999999997
because of this is he's totally

2896.29 --> 2902.079
discredited no no beyond the curve was a

2898.57 --> 2905.77
very devious movie edited by people that

2902.079 --> 2910.03
were extremely politicized against flat

2905.77 --> 2911.95
earth and as blatantly obvious come on I

2910.03 --> 2913.3590000000004
didn't see any jump guns I didn't see

2911.95 --> 2915.16
any major jump cuts like nothing like

2913.359 --> 2917.56
Richard Dawkins interviews where I can

2915.16 --> 2919.75
clearly see the 15 car no they don't

2917.56 --> 2922.0
need to they just leave everything out

2919.75 --> 2925.119
except for a few things and then make it

2922.0 --> 2926.56
make them seem look stupid that's what

2925.119 --> 2928.81
they did and have a lot of commentary

2926.56 --> 2931.99
I'm a psychologist about all they're so

2928.81 --> 2936.96
sad and clinging to the community yeah

2931.99 --> 2942.1899999999996
yeah it was a total hit piece come on

2936.96 --> 2944.89
well this is accident [Â __Â ] is what CNN

2942.19 --> 2947.589
does okay it's the same kind of angle to

2944.89 --> 2949.9
it same kind of arwen ology all they did

2947.589 --> 2951.7599999999998
was let jaren ism do his experiment and

2949.9 --> 2952.9900000000002
then document what happened unless

2951.76 --> 2955.0890000000004
there's unless there's been account

2952.99 --> 2956.95
worthy they've maliciously cut the thing

2955.089 --> 2958.48
in half somewhere and said okay actually

2956.95 --> 2960.97
the experiment did prove the office up

2958.48 --> 2962.95
we just added to such that it doesn't he

2960.97 --> 2965.74
was left to do his experiment he did his

2962.95 --> 2967.24
little torch experiment that was shown

2965.74 --> 2968.6499999999996
on the screen as with diagrams and stuff

2967.24 --> 2970.3289999999997
you you can look at me so I'm sure you

2968.65 --> 2973.089
know we were talking in that very moment

2970.329 --> 2976.78
the result didn't come out as he

2973.089 --> 2977.68
expected I'm one man well he did follow

2976.78 --> 2982.599
up expert

2977.68 --> 2985.48
he even reported on this okay you don't

2982.599 --> 2988.21
stop when something just doesn't come

2985.48 --> 2990.609
out what you expect you try something

2988.21 --> 2994.059
different you you have to isolate all

2990.609 --> 2995.41
the variables first anyway try something

2994.059 --> 2997.9
really not very hoping they're right

2995.41 --> 3003.1499999999996
something else and see if the same kind

2997.9 --> 3006.51
of thing happens like he's trying to

3003.15 --> 3009.15
figure it out so just cut it off at that

3006.51 --> 3011.1600000000003
moment when he had basically had his

3009.15 --> 3012.6600000000003
first yeah

3011.16 --> 3015.21
failure and that happens in

3012.66 --> 3017.1299999999997
experimentation as you try it out that

3015.21 --> 3019.109
happens especially if you're threading

3017.13 --> 3022.4100000000003
new ground just trying to figure out

3019.109 --> 3025.3489999999997
data okay you make mistakes and to just

3022.41 --> 3027.359
cut it off at such a point and then show

3025.349 --> 3031.26
nothing else after that it's just a

3027.359 --> 3033.99
dishonest portrayal of what goes on and

3031.26 --> 3036.3900000000003
then also play the music over it it's

3033.99 --> 3041.91
highly manipulative it's an incomplete

3036.39 --> 3046.589
picture colored by music it's a hit

3041.91 --> 3048.1189999999997
piece sorry that sounds like a rational

3046.589 --> 3049.74
argument if they did just one experiment

3048.119 --> 3051.21
although that was just one of jaren isms

3049.74 --> 3053.4599999999996
experiments the other experiment they

3051.21 --> 3054.9
did with us was with a keg gyroscope or

3053.46 --> 3056.94
gyroscope hurry you want to prance it

3054.9 --> 3060.44
yeah and it show quite clearly the earth

3056.94 --> 3062.64
is a globe when it rotates so don't know

3060.44 --> 3064.77
they showed the follow up experiments

3062.64 --> 3067.5
for him it doesn't work out on any level

3064.77 --> 3069.69
really first off you can't use a

3067.5 --> 3072.38
gyroscope to prove the rotation of the

3069.69 --> 3075.15
earth because you can't very

3072.38 --> 3077.579
manipulative rotation of the earth so

3075.15 --> 3080.9300000000003
that's that is very simple no but this

3077.579 --> 3084.9300000000003
is just a fact that's a natural fact and

3080.93 --> 3087.24
ya globus have to accept that and yeah

3084.93 --> 3088.95
we don't claim any of these yeah we

3087.24 --> 3092.16
don't claim the earth is stationary as a

3088.95 --> 3096.68
scientific fact either you know because

3092.16 --> 3099.359
we can change it's stationary Ness so

3096.68 --> 3100.7999999999997
it's just out of the scale in that sense

3099.359 --> 3103.89
but

3100.8 --> 3106.5600000000004
yeah the gyroscope thing okay I have my

3103.89 --> 3108.99
own story about that in response to it

3106.56 --> 3112.65
inst that is that it's all ridiculous

3108.99 --> 3114.66
because where was Bob when he was doing

3112.65 --> 3117.44
this measurement okay he wasn't at the

3114.66 --> 3120.6299999999997
North Pole he wasn't at the South Pole

3117.44 --> 3122.88
he was somewhere in America or something

3120.63 --> 3125.67
yes on that length and if you have a

3122.88 --> 3131.13
gyroscope of any kind and it's gonna

3125.67 --> 3134.16
rotate around on the axis perfectly

3131.13 --> 3137.04
perpendicular to the supposed axis of

3134.16 --> 3139.08
the earth then that doesn't make any

3137.04 --> 3141.09
sense rotation of the earth why's that

3139.08 --> 3143.93
doesn't make any damn sense because it

3141.09 --> 3146.7000000000003
should be rotating at a very specific

3143.93 --> 3148.98
angle because of the position on the

3146.7 --> 3152.1899999999996
earth and it didn't do that it's just

3148.98 --> 3154.26
perpendicular to the center point of the

3152.19 --> 3157.56
earth so it doesn't prove rotation at

3154.26 --> 3162.6600000000003
all it's a false assumption to begin

3157.56 --> 3165.18
with see it's geometrically inconsistent

3162.66 --> 3166.77
with how the earth is supposed to be a

3165.18 --> 3170.0099999999998
globe and spinning in a certain

3166.77 --> 3171.42
orientation doesn't work out so it's

3170.01 --> 3173.4900000000002
just a coincidence that our Eve is the

3171.42 --> 3175.89
exact angular velocity that we think

3173.49 --> 3178.43
that the earth is rotating at yeah no

3175.89 --> 3184.2599999999998
just a coincidence no we didn't do that

3178.43 --> 3186.8399999999997
dude no well it's approaching 2:00 p.m.

3184.26 --> 3188.46
and I'm I wish I could stay for two

3186.84 --> 3189.75
hours like last name but I did say to

3188.46 --> 3192.06
myself at the start that I can only stay

3189.75 --> 3194.94
for an hour my exams are on the 16th

3192.06 --> 3196.68
I've got work to do it was a pleasure

3194.94 --> 3199.17
talking to you our on I mean we don't

3196.68 --> 3200.2799999999997
got about each other yeah I guess I'll

3199.17 --> 3204.9500000000003
see you around

3200.28 --> 3204.9500000000003
all right see you around see ya

3206.51 --> 3215.63
all right alrighty dokie

3210.71 --> 3220.21
ok yeah I've been at 52 minutes some

3215.63 --> 3222.7000000000003
more time so right ok that was Kyle oh

3220.21 --> 3230.27
wow

3222.7 --> 3235.25
man no this guy's very very deeply into

3230.27 --> 3244.07
an a walk knowledge I probably never can

3235.25 --> 3246.76
get this guy out of it ever but yeah it

3244.07 --> 3246.76
was interesting

3262.67 --> 3279.88
Hey hello only Schiphol can't see a long

3265.58 --> 3283.64
time no see thanks yeah win I don't know

3279.88 --> 3286.7200000000003
I'm just really sad that this guy is

3283.64 --> 3291.47
such a Mainliner it's oh my god

3286.72 --> 3292.8999999999996
see like religiously obliged to accept

3291.47 --> 3299.2599999999998
all things

3292.9 --> 3299.26
it's like yourself just creeps me out

3301.96 --> 3309.67
this climate change in nonsense it's

3304.79 --> 3313.21
ridiculous it's just another scientism

3309.67 --> 3313.21
[Â __Â ] narrative

3318.15 --> 3326.94
no I am all for co2 need more of it and

3324.259 --> 3331.14
besides if it was supposedly causing

3326.94 --> 3333.7200000000003
warming well yeah let's go bang co2 more

3331.14 --> 3337.23
we're actually heading into a solar

3333.72 --> 3339.0589999999997
minimum I almost forgot about that but

3337.23 --> 3341.849
yeah should have brought it up back but

3339.059 --> 3346.049
we're heading to a solar minimum less

3341.849 --> 3354.0190000000002
Sun activity so yeah we need more co2 to

3346.049 --> 3354.019
absorb and to assist the plants so yeah

3355.49 --> 3364.9799999999996
just make sure it's only really co2 and

3359.099 --> 3369.259
yeah not harmless substances and not

3364.98 --> 3369.259
yeah real poisonous stuff

3377.41 --> 3385.7
hello Jose yeah the guy I don't know he

3381.89 --> 3389.81
just contacted me over Skype I think he

3385.7 --> 3393.68
probably got to me through simondon it

3389.81 --> 3398.47
was in that face but yeah I don't know I

3393.68 --> 3405.79
find him a decent conversation list but

3398.47 --> 3410.0299999999997
yeah he is kind of evasive at times yeah

3405.79 --> 3412.82
he does have yeah maybe potentially

3410.03 --> 3416.3300000000004
dormant globe or tendencies of yeah

3412.82 --> 3419.06
being a persistent red herring in

3416.33 --> 3426.1
certain with certain questions yeah

3419.06 --> 3426.1
that's very typical to hood

3433.63 --> 3437.17
made yourself

3437.27 --> 3443.74
[Music]

3439.98 --> 3445.92
yeah I'm gonna get a car some regular

3443.74 --> 3445.9199999999996
one

3485.66 --> 3492.44
there's hello Adam Eakin yeah it's just

3488.9 --> 3494.92
a regular class all organic though it's

3492.44 --> 3498.9500000000003
nice but yeah I didn't want the

3494.92 --> 3501.37
Illuminati class or one for once just a

3498.95 --> 3501.37
regular

3506.48 --> 3509.719
[Music]

3536.41 --> 3547.0589999999997
Oh God the gyro data well look I even

3542.829 --> 3550.809
forgot to bring it up it's not a regular

3547.059 --> 3555.88
Oh biome thank you by the way a Rambo

3550.809 --> 3559.71
Jambo for the $10 connait canadian

3555.88 --> 3559.71
dollar super chad donation thank you

3561.96 --> 3570.13
yeah thank you for comparing me to

3566.349 --> 3574.349
Nathan in dealing with religious globe

3570.13 --> 3574.349
heads I had try to be very tolerant but

3576.059 --> 3587.73
Nathan not so much Nathan is more like

3579.759 --> 3587.73
straight straight for the kill hmm but

3588.359 --> 3594.39
yeah the gyro data I almost forgot I

3592.119 --> 3596.049
didn't almost I forgot to mention that

3594.39 --> 3599.14
yeah there wasn't

3596.049 --> 3602.019
it was just a was it again the ring

3599.14 --> 3605.2889999999998
laser gyro it was one of these the light

3602.019 --> 3610.779
based gyroscopes that had this this

3605.289 --> 3615.3390000000004
rotation effect over time but a regular

3610.779 --> 3621.13
physical gyroscope doesn't do that so

3615.339 --> 3624.19
yeah that doesn't make any sense you

3621.13 --> 3627.46
can't have one gyroscope not do it and

3624.19 --> 3629.23
the rest do it and then claim that the

3627.46 --> 3632.109
earth is physically a spinning ball

3629.23 --> 3636.599
because then the physical gyroscopes

3632.109 --> 3636.5989999999997
should perform exactly the same

3645.18 --> 3649.8489999999997
ah cool congratulations Hosea

3654.11 --> 3657.179
[Music]

3667.47 --> 3670.47
hmm

3691.05 --> 3697.44
that was good so yeah I passed the our

3695.16 --> 3700.08
mark and I'm gonna round out the show

3697.44 --> 3702.14
and Nathan's debates already started I

3700.08 --> 3702.14
think

3710.72 --> 3718.52
yeah so thanks everyone for coming and

3713.48 --> 3722.27
yeah watching this second go with Kyle

3718.52 --> 3726.2599999999998
and yeah we brought up a lot of subjects

3722.27 --> 3727.55
from gravity to climate change and a bit

3726.26 --> 3730.55
of yeah

3727.55 --> 3733.88
fake space well all over the place it

3730.55 --> 3736.3390000000004
was quite the contrast so I hope you

3733.88 --> 3738.8900000000003
enjoyed it if you did please upload the
