2.659 --> 13.23
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

6.33 --> 16.289
early-bird number 17 very good

13.23 --> 21.2
I'm your host Arwen today I have no

16.289 --> 25.160000000000004
guests starting out but yeah there's I

21.2 --> 28.74
have some things to talk about

25.16 --> 31.85
fascinating new theory that popped into

28.74 --> 37.019
my mind after having watched one of

31.85 --> 39.42
martin Lita's latest videos flat earth

37.019 --> 43.289
British so one of my favorite channels

39.42 --> 48.53
to watch he delves into the mud flood

43.289 --> 54.03
and yeah alternative history and it is

48.53 --> 58.35
it is consistent with other sources that

54.03 --> 61.760000000000005
I have found and what I just realized is

58.35 --> 65.729
yeah Martin's been dealing with the

61.76 --> 67.79899999999999
fashions as he calls them and I think

65.729 --> 72.229
that's probably the right way to

67.799 --> 74.82000000000001
pronounce it in English these is ancient

72.229 --> 79.259
electromagnetic technology of basically

74.82 --> 82.90899999999999
pipes being tied together like a bundle

79.259 --> 91.17
of sticks it's it's been widely

82.909 --> 94.409
symbologies in say in iconography and

91.17 --> 97.17
well in ancient paintings and well he

94.409 --> 101.0
James Martin demonstrates many many

97.17 --> 104.399
pictures that have them and also the

101.0 --> 107.46
mysterious and potentially partially

104.399 --> 112.039
fake Roman Empire and everything that's

107.46 --> 116.63999999999999
been found of that also contains lots of

112.039 --> 118.679
flashes and there's been theories

116.64 --> 120.509
developing that smart Martin's been

118.679 --> 125.659
working on and I kind of concur that

120.509 --> 129.78
these devices are energy weapons

125.659 --> 132.63
potentially sound bass and there's yeah

129.78 --> 134.97
signs that they even have been used to

132.63 --> 139.38
like destroy walls

134.97 --> 140.64
with massive force and then suddenly

139.38 --> 144.69
realize something

140.64 --> 150.6
what about star forts we've found a lot

144.69 --> 153.69
of those but I've met Don remember ever

150.6 --> 158.43
having seen one that's been destroyed so

153.69 --> 161.57999999999998
if a group which could be the Romans or

158.43 --> 164.25
later have been rewritten as the Romans

161.58 --> 168.0
were actually going around and almost

164.25 --> 170.07
like European style Mongolians ravaging

168.0 --> 173.7
the place with these fascists destroying

170.07 --> 179.19
castles or maybe the star forts have

173.7 --> 183.61999999999998
been built in response to this this type

179.19 --> 187.32
of device because if you look at a star

183.62 --> 194.13
what is it it's basically pointy stars

187.32 --> 196.07999999999998
and yeah if these devices are energy

194.13 --> 199.26
weapons that can be projected over

196.08 --> 200.97
distance which a kind of requires it

199.26 --> 207.12
since you don't want to get up too close

200.97 --> 210.48
or you'll be shot by archers so if you

207.12 --> 212.85
would use a fascist to try to destroy a

210.48 --> 215.1
star fort then yeah you could fire in a

212.85 --> 217.97
distance but because of the starship

215.1 --> 223.38
because of these points this will

217.97 --> 226.64
potentially deflect and undo the

223.38 --> 228.87
strength of the power of the fascist

226.64 --> 230.67
could naturally do that because of the

228.87 --> 234.299
pointy shape and if you want to actually

230.67 --> 237.54
do some damage and head straight into

234.299 --> 239.73000000000002
the wall of directly face it you have to

237.54 --> 243.5
go up closer and approach one of these

239.73 --> 247.07999999999998
points and that's dangerous so I think

243.5 --> 250.65
that the star forts have been designed

247.08 --> 253.709
to basically counter the fasces

250.65 --> 257.15
and that's why we don't find any of them

253.709 --> 261.51
haven't been destroyed in a radical way

257.15 --> 264.479
blown up so yeah that's a new theory

261.51 --> 267.09
that just again slipped in there

264.479 --> 269.419
watching one of Martin's videos always

267.09 --> 274.789
very inspiring

269.419 --> 277.75899999999996
another little factoid also some other

274.789 --> 281.909
concepts concerning the fascists that I

277.759 --> 283.71000000000004
feel very doubtful about fully putting

281.909 --> 291.659
out there because of the potential

283.71 --> 296.75899999999996
consequences let's just put it like this

291.659 --> 299.129
I think that even with the potential

296.759 --> 302.009
rediscovery of this device by the public

299.129 --> 305.34000000000003
is probably gonna be forbidden to

302.009 --> 307.47
experiment with it well even if you

305.34 --> 309.06
could just blow up walls with sound

307.47 --> 311.25
waves or whatever

309.06 --> 315.479
yeah that's already pretty damn

311.25 --> 319.259
dangerous but oh the things that in my

315.479 --> 320.909
mind could be done with the device like

319.259 --> 323.25
that of that nature

320.909 --> 328.469
how you could potentially mechanically

323.25 --> 332.84
apply that with scary it is very

328.469 --> 332.84
dangerous potentially that device so I

333.289 --> 341.159
yeah I hope Martin if he really gets

338.28 --> 343.77
into like for example delves into secret

341.159 --> 346.02
technical specs that he'd look through

343.77 --> 348.44899999999996
them first and then figure out is this

346.02 --> 353.94
something that I need to just share in

348.449 --> 358.139
the open to anyone but yeah I think what

353.94 --> 360.569
either he's an older guy but he's wise

358.139 --> 361.289
enough to know these kind of things and

360.569 --> 366.68
he's good

361.289 --> 372.259
so he's not totally reckless he's not so

366.68 --> 372.259
yeah that's a little thought about

372.529 --> 377.37
ancient technology in the Roman Empire

375.0 --> 380.52
also I thought about the Roman Empire

377.37 --> 383.19
and seems pretty obvious that there

380.52 --> 386.639
probably wasn't really a Roman Empire

383.19 --> 392.639
although that doesn't exclude there from

386.639 --> 394.61
a very powerful group of Romans which

392.639 --> 398.88
would probably not be very liked

394.61 --> 402.12
anywhere could be have been ravaging and

398.88 --> 406.169
looting and taking control of

402.12 --> 409.47
for example city-states and maybe even

406.169 --> 412.85999999999996
already started engaged in brainwashing

409.47 --> 415.5
to some degree like kind of societal

412.86 --> 418.91900000000004
brainwashing like we've experienced in

415.5 --> 424.979
this super huge set up but in the more

418.919 --> 427.96999999999997
primitive stage more cult-like so yeah

424.979 --> 430.65
that could have happened could have been

427.97 --> 433.62
just a big influencing party they

430.65 --> 436.46999999999997
started out like Ravagers and eventually

433.62 --> 443.76
started to end up involving themselves a

436.47 --> 445.95000000000005
lot in politics just and B and you abuse

443.76 --> 450.21
these positions to basically have

445.95 --> 452.61
history rewritten afterwards when they

450.21 --> 455.37
no longer really in the old like in the

452.61 --> 457.8
old days ravaged a lot and now they

455.37 --> 463.02
would only do that for political purpose

457.8 --> 465.03000000000003
this imperial strategy very nasty nature

463.02 --> 468.09
if you think about it like the idea of

465.03 --> 471.419
just an empire absorbing more countries

468.09 --> 474.23999999999995
and just becoming like a country almost

471.419 --> 476.7
that seems very prefer even though they

474.24 --> 478.979
would of course you slaves and sacrifice

476.7 --> 481.49
and crap but that would be more

478.979 --> 486.65999999999997
preferable even than just a ban of

481.49 --> 489.69
insidious looters and evil mind

486.66 --> 492.15000000000003
controllers cult creators that they

489.69 --> 498.63
could actually potentially turn out to

492.15 --> 501.92999999999995
have been instead and well it backs up

498.63 --> 504.599
my theory that the Roman Empire even so

501.93 --> 509.76
I called it was basically the start of

504.599 --> 511.919
the human centric world religion cult

509.76 --> 513.99
and atheism and the planets and

511.919 --> 516.659
everything all of it could have been

513.99 --> 521.12
spawned by them by that group of

516.659 --> 524.75
insidious planners and strategists and

521.12 --> 528.74
Psychopaths pretty pretty damn likely so

524.75 --> 528.74
maybe that's how it works

529.79 --> 536.5999999999999
it's a lot of ponder upon does make

533.48 --> 538.73
sense if they would have access to that

536.6 --> 540.62
technology that would be Tim the fascist

538.73 --> 542.9
technology would typically be something

540.62 --> 546.55
that's just stored in the Vatican kept

542.9 --> 552.4399999999999
secret maybe even applied in times of

546.55 --> 555.4399999999999
crisis or times of just editing the

552.44 --> 558.0200000000001
world setting just trying to reprogram

555.44 --> 560.75
it wipe out certain parts and stroy

558.02 --> 562.48
certain history that kind of [ __ ] the

560.75 --> 565.13
things that we don't want

562.48 --> 568.01
yeah the fascist would be very easily

565.13 --> 572.72
used for massive destruction very

568.01 --> 574.46
quickly is especially by people that

572.72 --> 576.8000000000001
have been sitting on the technology and

574.46 --> 582.83
have had the ability to refine it into

576.8 --> 588.77
perfection for centuries so pretty scary

582.83 --> 594.47
outlook but let let it all unfold and we

588.77 --> 597.92
will see what happens you know times of

594.47 --> 599.63
creates crisis and need you know [ __ ]

597.92 --> 601.91
hits the fan but there's also people

599.63 --> 605.6899999999999
that have been sitting and breeding on

601.91 --> 607.91
things that have no reason to basically

605.69 --> 609.83
manifest that will suddenly start to

607.91 --> 613.37
develop it because there now is in need

609.83 --> 615.59
and there may be plenty of people out

613.37 --> 618.74
there potentially that have knowledge of

615.59 --> 621.71
the fascist technology that are will be

618.74 --> 624.17
a counter if such a scenario breaks out

621.71 --> 628.94
so yeah all kinds of scenarios could

624.17 --> 630.8
just happen suddenly overnight almost

628.94 --> 633.61
like an alien invasion it would probably

630.8 --> 638.18
seem to many people and may even use

633.61 --> 640.5500000000001
that as a cover like have typical

638.18 --> 644.5999999999999
suggesting spacesuits or whatever and

640.55 --> 649.16
just use fasces sort of disguise design

644.6 --> 654.53
as alien laser blasters wouldn't be that

649.16 --> 656.87
hard right yeah I can imagine it so they

654.53 --> 662.12
could definitely imagine it and perfect

656.87 --> 665.22
it anyway let's see who is in chat

662.12 --> 669.27
all right they would read first and

665.22 --> 673.2900000000001
Daniel I mean that then W and infield

669.27 --> 677.37
and then Daniel field to see you

673.29 --> 685.05
headquarters II and ajm have been having

677.37 --> 690.2
a discussion pretty long and Billy was a

685.05 --> 696.4499999999999
lo Thorson good to see you

690.2 --> 701.19
flat earth questioner yeah I hope you've

696.45 --> 706.6500000000001
been you're interested in what I've

701.19 --> 709.5600000000001
shared in the concept yeah I've already

706.65 --> 713.01
invited Martin let go for like man let's

709.56 --> 716.01
talk about this stuff you know we could

713.01 --> 720.029
to me all of this is like a giant puzzle

716.01 --> 722.22
and I just see I tend to see tend to fit

720.029 --> 726.0889999999999
pieces just like this just with the star

722.22 --> 728.37
force it makes sense its approach it

726.089 --> 731.07
from a designer perspective everything

728.37 --> 732.9590000000001
is designed for a reason these star

731.07 --> 734.94
forts are not just shaped like this

732.959 --> 738.0
because they look funky or because

734.94 --> 742.5290000000001
they're all cold no they're obviously

738.0 --> 747.529
built with the points to deflect to

742.529 --> 752.9399999999999
deflect like a wave of force big broad

747.529 --> 756.39
blast cannons cannons could potentially

752.94 --> 759.4200000000001
shoot right through them so although ya

756.39 --> 761.97
may still be difficult to be big cannon

759.42 --> 764.6999999999999
but if you're gonna unleash a wave of

761.97 --> 769.3100000000001
force then these star shapes will

764.7 --> 772.3100000000001
absolutely deflect a lot of that force

769.31 --> 772.31
so

773.83 --> 784.9000000000001
just makes sense so look at it

782.98 --> 787.24
Martin leeches channel flatters British

784.9 --> 792.25
you know what I'm gonna just put a link

787.24 --> 793.9300000000001
to the video that I watched that

792.25 --> 798.88
basically inspired this idea and you

793.93 --> 800.53
commented in it as well put it in chat

798.88 --> 803.62
here so you can take a look for yourself

800.53 --> 807.31
it's pretty long so it's a big ride two

803.62 --> 816.64
and a half hours haven't even watched

807.31 --> 821.9399999999999
through it all seems that Martin agrees

816.64 --> 823.73
with me on the star for theory awesome

821.94 --> 826.83
that's very cool

823.73 --> 826.83
[Music]

831.03 --> 841.3299999999999
so what else is going on yeah Flattr

838.0 --> 842.92
debates of course lots of pushing

841.33 --> 846.36
pushing pushing pushing on that

842.92 --> 848.5
perspective which is an absolute win

846.36 --> 852.46
it's a win for us

848.5 --> 857.28
it's the globus make themselves look

852.46 --> 859.47
like complete freaks and psychologically

857.28 --> 863.92
blind idiots

859.47 --> 866.26
and the public learns about optics just

863.92 --> 867.99
learns hey look this thing this is how

866.26 --> 870.4
it works you can test it you can do it

867.99 --> 874.9
just have to be curious enough we're

870.4 --> 879.16
actually willing to know it and then

874.9 --> 881.14
yeah you can test it it works and yeah

879.16 --> 884.86
very easy when you know there's a lot

881.14 --> 887.62
that is debatable then presupposition

884.86 --> 891.28
blah blah this is so directly provable

887.62 --> 895.21
you just can't presuppose your way

891.28 --> 897.37
around it it's like okay sure you know

895.21 --> 900.33
who globe how should it be that's nice

897.37 --> 902.5600000000001
but yeah their fraction is there so how

900.33 --> 903.57
does that fit together with the

902.56 --> 906.529
observations

903.57 --> 910.6890000000001
it doesn't Oh

906.529 --> 916.069
yeah you got a problem there big one

910.689 --> 918.169
earth-size felt so good luck with that

916.069 --> 920.689
and they have been saying it for almost

918.169 --> 923.299
a year now get to work on that fractal

920.689 --> 926.149
looming concept it's gonna be a massive

923.299 --> 928.669
calculus task to figure out the right

926.149 --> 934.279
formula to get a ball to bend into a

928.669 --> 936.829
flat plane so yeah good luck could be

934.279 --> 939.469
done but it's gonna be very obviously a

936.829 --> 941.269
giant machination of course if you

939.469 --> 944.3290000000001
release the source code for the

941.269 --> 947.329
calculation system that's yeah that's

944.329 --> 949.6389999999999
not really our problem it's what happens

947.329 --> 952.7589999999999
when you rely on Mecca nation upon

949.639 --> 957.429
machination to propel your model to

952.759 --> 962.409
propel your religious concepts it's not

957.429 --> 969.1089999999999
very tight to cover up a lot of holes oh

962.409 --> 971.689
well yeah so that's interesting in the

969.109 --> 974.989
Flat Earth debates of course lot of

971.689 --> 981.909
debates starts right after this show

974.989 --> 981.909
ends at Nathan Oakley in 1980 Channel

985.61 --> 998.54
also another reference to Jose's amazing

991.459 --> 1001.63
video yesterday oh yeah that those those

998.54 --> 1007.029
pictures really those pictures or

1001.63 --> 1010.8389999999999
something something else it's amazing

1007.029 --> 1016.23
fascinating surreal very worthwhile

1010.839 --> 1023.589
watching so take a look at Jose Jay s

1016.23 --> 1026.709
Gonzalez JS g jg comes out as dead Jose

1023.589 --> 1031.1200000000001
JG you can say this channel for some

1026.709 --> 1033.49
amazing horas y ahora zone footage

1031.12 --> 1035.35
zoomed in footage and see all these

1033.49 --> 1038.65
surreal effects Hey

1035.35 --> 1039.9099999999999
long live Tortuga alert hey what's up

1038.65 --> 1040.5400000000002
are we how you doing good morning

1039.91 --> 1044.53
everybody

1040.54 --> 1048.6399999999999
I was just talking about you a great

1044.53 --> 1051.22
video how are you doing doing good yeah

1048.64 --> 1053.14
just got a fork I check what was on the

1051.22 --> 1055.27
YouTube I said oh I win it's like let me

1053.14 --> 1058.179
click on the Hangout before even

1055.27 --> 1063.76
checking what's going on cool thanks for

1058.179 --> 1068.13
joining just rode my bike if hazy mean

1063.76 --> 1073.0
hazy like a modern what's up Travis

1068.13 --> 1074.47
morning yeah really hazy and I was

1073.0 --> 1076.63
coming through a train track I said let

1074.47 --> 1079.419
me see what can I see bro I cannot see

1076.63 --> 1081.94
maybe quarter of a mile away just with

1079.419 --> 1084.5500000000002
my eyes haziness is crazy I was gonna

1081.94 --> 1086.89
grab my bike when I get home to record a

1084.55 --> 1089.559
little bit more and it's not worth it

1086.89 --> 1091.8700000000001
the Sun is coming out the Haight looks

1089.559 --> 1099.46
to start disappearing but it's bad worth

1091.87 --> 1101.53
it yeah I I sent that footage over to a

1099.46 --> 1104.5900000000001
buddy of mine that that he and I have

1101.53 --> 1108.52
gone toe-to-toe on this flattered debate

1104.59 --> 1109.4399999999998
and his immediate response yeah that

1108.52 --> 1113.1299999999999
doesn't prove anything

1109.44 --> 1113.13
no proof of anything

1117.45 --> 1134.26
that's some of their approach but what

1120.58 --> 1136.09
proof if who is willing hello hello yeah

1134.26 --> 1138.91
what they were the footage I took proves

1136.09 --> 1141.25
is I was able to replicate soundly

1138.91 --> 1142.78
observation 100% it doesn't matter what

1141.25 --> 1144.61
the conditions are it doesn't matter the

1142.78 --> 1147.6399999999999
distance I was able to replicate it

1144.61 --> 1150.1
that's the point you know so I choose to

1147.64 --> 1153.13
the right spot I choose the right angle

1150.1 --> 1155.1699999999998
I should the video and I got the effect

1153.13 --> 1163.5
I mean what else can you ask for

1155.17 --> 1163.5
I agree you get what you see

1167.25 --> 1173.25
hey have you you guys heard the first

1169.92 --> 1176.13
part of this hanger talking about some

1173.25 --> 1177.3
stuff about Star Force did you follow I

1176.13 --> 1180.69
haven't oh really

1177.3 --> 1186.4199999999998
that came to light again they the Star

1180.69 --> 1188.67
Force subject Martin no a Martin was

1186.42 --> 1193.41
actually talking about the Roman Empire

1188.67 --> 1195.51
and dubious nature of its existence that

1193.41 --> 1198.39
I laid out some theories about that of

1195.51 --> 1202.02
my own in this hang up and to start but

1198.39 --> 1205.47
mostly about the she's the certain these

1202.02 --> 1209.01
rods that weird agents electromagnetic

1205.47 --> 1210.57
technology and Martin theorizes and I

1209.01 --> 1215.6
kind of agree that they've been used

1210.57 --> 1218.52
like energy blasting weapons

1215.6 --> 1221.01
pretentiously sound base for example and

1218.52 --> 1224.55
they were used to basically just blast

1221.01 --> 1225.84
open walls and then I thought oh really

1224.55 --> 1228.75
there's certain by the way even

1225.84 --> 1231.33
depictions of this and carrying this

1228.75 --> 1234.18
stuff and just having giant holes in the

1231.33 --> 1237.96
wall like huge just the entire wall just

1234.18 --> 1240.3
blasted away pushed pushed through so I

1237.96 --> 1243.15
think you have mega marts yeah

1240.3 --> 1247.23
star forts have probably been built in

1243.15 --> 1249.6000000000001
response to these devices because a star

1247.23 --> 1251.58
for it has points on all sides and if

1249.6 --> 1254.4299999999998
you're gonna project a giant wave of

1251.58 --> 1258.24
energy or sound it's gonna deflect

1254.43 --> 1260.3400000000001
because of the points or you'd have to

1258.24 --> 1264.06
approach it but yeah then you're gonna

1260.34 --> 1265.9199999999998
be exposed and shot at and so you can't

1264.06 --> 1269.82
use the device at a distance because

1265.92 --> 1272.97
there's no wall you're straight you're

1269.82 --> 1275.58
facing yeah it's a star fort it's very

1272.97 --> 1277.56
simple but genius design and I think

1275.58 --> 1281.58
that's why we don't find any destroyed

1277.56 --> 1283.2
star wars and I see you interest in this

1281.58 --> 1284.51
subject because you have mentioned about

1283.2 --> 1288.3
your fascination on

1284.51 --> 1294.35
sounds and and you know frequencies and

1288.3 --> 1296.55
stuff so yeah I see you hopefully yeah

1294.35 --> 1300.9599999999998
it makes perfect sense to me

1296.55 --> 1302.49
look Castle destructions lots of it

1300.96 --> 1305.97
and then the star forts in the

1302.49 --> 1308.24
Renaissance basically as a response and

1305.97 --> 1310.1100000000001
they haven't really been destroyed

1308.24 --> 1314.1
probably been a lot of fights

1310.11 --> 1318.27
surrounding them but there's no blasted

1314.1 --> 1321.27
away parts of stomach forts that I've

1318.27 --> 1323.76
seen so far seem to all be pretty much

1321.27 --> 1325.59
in one piece all right so I'm a complete

1323.76 --> 1328.59
newbie I have no idea what you're

1325.59 --> 1333.24
talking about us star what star fort a

1328.59 --> 1335.6689999999999
type of fortress with a specific design

1333.24 --> 1339.36
instead of having the usual typical

1335.669 --> 1343.74
towers and walls in between potentially

1339.36 --> 1347.85
multiple of those it is a specific point

1343.74 --> 1352.71
design which has it's like a circle with

1347.85 --> 1356.039
spikes towards the outside so there's no

1352.71 --> 1360.2
snow wall facing any outside there's

1356.039 --> 1364.26
only points facing outside on every side

1360.2 --> 1368.97
and these are actual yeah they're all

1364.26 --> 1372.6
over the place and Europe and again so

1368.97 --> 1375.02
so here's my ignorance again so we

1372.6 --> 1379.23
haven't been told about these things

1375.02 --> 1382.23
nope they're just out there so like the

1379.23 --> 1384.179
city we're in the middle of cities yeah

1382.23 --> 1386.3990000000001
but if I go back to you know middle

1384.179 --> 1389.159
school history and whatever there's no

1386.399 --> 1392.9089999999999
specific focus on these forts in terms

1389.159 --> 1396.72
of their their oddity during the time

1392.909 --> 1398.6100000000001
period or whatnot mm-hmm because I don't

1396.72 --> 1406.049
remember hearing about star forts you

1398.61 --> 1408.08
know I mean I guess what I'm asking is

1406.049 --> 1410.52
are these recent are these recent

1408.08 --> 1412.74
rediscoveries or these things no no no

1410.52 --> 1414.75
they're they're just around it's a

1412.74 --> 1419.039
subject that's not really

1414.75 --> 1421.409
okay yell to with oh there are of course

1419.039 --> 1425.01
people that reason about it and there's

1421.409 --> 1427.2890000000002
a lot of tactical applications for

1425.01 --> 1429.24
positioning and like how armies could

1427.289 --> 1431.85
invade it how it works it makes it very

1429.24 --> 1433.91
hard to conquer but the design would

1431.85 --> 1436.9099999999999
also make it fast

1433.91 --> 1439.73
prove it couldn't just be blowing up

1436.91 --> 1443.3300000000002
because yeah they probably wouldn't have

1439.73 --> 1445.16
built it them after all that because

1443.33 --> 1447.32
even if you have a really really really

1445.16 --> 1449.18
good fortress but it's not fascist proof

1447.32 --> 1451.37
yeah all these guys have to do is just

1449.18 --> 1453.04
come along and just blow it up and all

1451.37 --> 1458.54
been for nothing

1453.04 --> 1461.54
so yeah but that yeah star forts they

1458.54 --> 1464.54
exist in France especially but all over

1461.54 --> 1466.67
the place but yeah they're not

1464.54 --> 1470.93
specifically mentioned it's just like

1466.67 --> 1479.48
who's more advanced fortress don't pay

1470.93 --> 1480.95
attention to it interesting and very

1479.48 --> 1483.41
beautiful by the way

1480.95 --> 1487.07
this fortress always very beautiful to

1483.41 --> 1489.14
see in the same neighborhood of subject

1487.07 --> 1492.86
do you think about you got an opinion on

1489.14 --> 1494.93
the pyramids of Egypt Peru and all over

1492.86 --> 1497.9599999999998
the place absolutely I do

1494.93 --> 1499.01
they're very outspoken one I've done

1497.96 --> 1503.1100000000001
hangouts about it

1499.01 --> 1505.34
I think pyramids they're now considered

1503.11 --> 1507.62
embarassingly like they're supposed to

1505.34 --> 1510.62
be tombs which is absolutely ridiculous

1507.62 --> 1513.4699999999998
in every sense you think they were built

1510.62 --> 1520.7299999999998
with the help of sound frequencies and

1513.47 --> 1523.8500000000001
stuff do depends there are several

1520.73 --> 1526.19
things involved in my complete theory on

1523.85 --> 1529.8799999999999
what pyramids are and how they've been

1526.19 --> 1531.98
built think it is very ancient

1529.88 --> 1534.8000000000002
technology

1531.98 --> 1540.47
pria she's maybe even but she's maybe

1534.8 --> 1544.73
just a reinvention and it is energy

1540.47 --> 1547.6100000000001
based the other rock how it's the type

1544.73 --> 1551.48
of rock where it's placed it's like a

1547.61 --> 1556.3899999999999
giant electric device but stone based

1551.48 --> 1561.19
and it is a gatherer and enhancer

1556.39 --> 1563.71
amplifier of high frequency electrical

1561.19 --> 1566.99
electrostatic energy basically and

1563.71 --> 1569.27
there's a specific patterns even been

1566.99 --> 1572.99
how'd that work what works where the

1569.27 --> 1575.78
energy would focus and it was rich it

1572.99 --> 1577.85
has waterways most pyramids discovered

1575.78 --> 1581.09
have waterways under an under it's it's

1577.85 --> 1584.11
not tunnels its waterways and that is

1581.09 --> 1587.47
because running water actually emits

1584.11 --> 1591.32
electricity very slight amounts and that

1587.47 --> 1593.99
electricity that running water would the

1591.32 --> 1596.6599999999999
electricity would rub off in the channel

1593.99 --> 1599.48
this stone that would conduct and then

1596.66 --> 1601.3400000000001
go up to the pyramid enhance it and you

1599.48 --> 1603.38
would have a water based energy

1601.34 --> 1608.33
generator that's very powerful very

1603.38 --> 1611.42
far-reaching and I personally think that

1608.33 --> 1614.36
this energy was also you useful for life

1611.42 --> 1618.3500000000001
and Giants thrives and it would make

1614.36 --> 1620.6899999999998
them it make things very survivable for

1618.35 --> 1623.51
them allowed them to be big without

1620.69 --> 1627.23
having to constantly gorge themselves

1623.51 --> 1629.39
just to survive and not break bones and

1627.23 --> 1633.35
everything so that and they probably

1629.39 --> 1639.0800000000002
assisted in building it big huge rocks

1633.35 --> 1640.73
and these rocks were partially molded in

1639.08 --> 1645.9199999999998
the sense that they probably use these

1640.73 --> 1649.01
the sonic horn things to change the

1645.92 --> 1652.8500000000001
frequency somehow of the rocks and make

1649.01 --> 1656.059
it malleable like turn it into clay and

1652.85 --> 1658.58
then undo it and it would solidify again

1656.059 --> 1661.61
that but so need to mold it into place

1658.58 --> 1667.52
because the rocks work really cuts piece

1661.61 --> 1669.29
by piece out of you know where they out

1667.52 --> 1672.8899999999999
of the mountains and they can still find

1669.29 --> 1675.55
the the pieces back where were they

1672.89 --> 1678.2
supposed to be so yeah they were

1675.55 --> 1682.82
originally real rock it's not just made

1678.2 --> 1685.49
putty clay from from from scratch they

1682.82 --> 1690.6499999999999
were real rocks but they were molded

1685.49 --> 1695.45
changed somehow so it's very complex

1690.65 --> 1697.2800000000002
process in a complex age and yeah an

1695.45 --> 1699.79
energy device that's what a pyramid is

1697.28 --> 1703.25
all of them

1699.79 --> 1706.01
livin in Seoul so coming in conclusion I

1703.25 --> 1714.5
think the people were smarter than us on

1706.01 --> 1717.5
building this type of structures tell us

1714.5 --> 1724.69
they're all dirty very much as smart as

1717.5 --> 1724.69
us but they had the opportunity to do it

1725.68 --> 1731.8100000000002
arranged in mind control yes I seen a

1730.46 --> 1734.8700000000001
few documentaries people trying to

1731.81 --> 1737.36
replicate pyramids in smaller scale and

1734.87 --> 1739.1
it's a freaking task

1737.36 --> 1741.62
you know if they go through hell using

1739.1 --> 1743.33
different techniques with all equipment

1741.62 --> 1746.9799999999998
and tools you know just have made

1743.33 --> 1750.1999999999998
anything industry industrial any any

1746.98 --> 1751.91
power tool you know so yeah it's tricky

1750.2 --> 1754.76
they're able to replicate it but they

1751.91 --> 1758.68
stay in the scale that they really probe

1754.76 --> 1761.05
it's the big ones are made if you say

1758.68 --> 1764.26
something else you know it's a marvel

1761.05 --> 1770.06
come on guys look if there were giants

1764.26 --> 1771.77
then to them it would be doable they

1770.06 --> 1774.25
just used the hole this has a theory

1771.77 --> 1779.12
they just used pulleys come on guys Oh

1774.25 --> 1782.57
in slaves yeah yep yep that's it on

1779.12 --> 1784.82
woods right yeah they done right there

1782.57 --> 1787.01
he's really right they roll up yep yep

1784.82 --> 1790.8799999999999
that's it that's why you like the movie

1787.01 --> 1794.3
yeah on movie lived in both in Bisbee

1790.88 --> 1795.43
he see was it there's something that was

1794.3 --> 1802.48
so [ __ ]

1795.43 --> 1805.3700000000001
nothing thirsty movie I saw it on TV no

1802.48 --> 1808.3700000000001
right now I think it's much more likely

1805.37 --> 1812.9299999999998
it was giants of various sizes humans

1808.37 --> 1816.05
and animals potentially as pets of the

1812.93 --> 1819.5600000000002
Giants and the humans as a giant Society

1816.05 --> 1821.03
is a large Society they'll know how it

1819.56 --> 1823.55
was structured I don't know if there was

1821.03 --> 1826.34
slavery some sort or maybe a social

1823.55 --> 1828.98
hierarchy system more like Hindus

1826.34 --> 1832.07
there's a caste system who knows but

1828.98 --> 1833.0
they built these devices and it was part

1832.07 --> 1835.25
of their society

1833.0 --> 1839.299
the Giants lived through it they also

1835.25 --> 1843.35
were required for building it and yeah

1839.299 --> 1846.59
it probably helped like cultivation of

1843.35 --> 1849.9699999999998
plants and everything yeah they were

1846.59 --> 1853.6689999999999
like the high tech high energy society

1849.97 --> 1860.03
not consumed by electronics but just

1853.669 --> 1860.8700000000001
rough energy technology what about did

1860.03 --> 1863.78
you see

1860.87 --> 1865.789
Karen's recent episode on Sun and Moon

1863.78 --> 1869.48
family where she talked about how many

1865.789 --> 1873.02
pyramids there actually are sorry how

1869.48 --> 1876.32
many yeah she did a short little video

1873.02 --> 1878.77
on how many pyramids there might

1876.32 --> 1885.4399999999998
actually really be it was a very long

1878.77 --> 1892.61
allots freaking hell of a lot like in

1885.44 --> 1894.169
the hundreds I think right yeah yeah and

1892.61 --> 1897.08
more to be found

1894.169 --> 1903.44
you know you might even eventually end

1897.08 --> 1906.3799999999999
up who knows digging finding giant

1903.44 --> 1908.69
caverns down there with a freaking

1906.38 --> 1910.4
pyramid in it you know you may find

1908.69 --> 1913.0700000000002
these freakin pyramids literally

1910.4 --> 1914.8700000000001
everywhere if this Empire with if the

1913.07 --> 1918.32
Atlantean Empire which was highly

1914.87 --> 1920.9899999999998
advanced and world covering yeah why

1918.32 --> 1923.51
wouldn't they like go into caverns and

1920.99 --> 1925.58
then just build another pyramid so the

1923.51 --> 1929.77
Giants could survive there too and they

1925.58 --> 1932.12
could have like a subterranean fortress

1929.77 --> 1935.03
situation or whatever you know that's

1932.12 --> 1938.1499999999999
what empires do so we may find pyramids

1935.03 --> 1940.97
freaking everywhere there's a room big

1938.15 --> 1941.8090000000002
enough there's a chance you might find

1940.97 --> 1944.38
the pyramids

1941.809 --> 1947.6
I think I was just listening to

1944.38 --> 1951.169
something last night and they brought up

1947.6 --> 1952.52
the crop circles and made the suggestion

1951.169 --> 1955.5490000000002
that they were possibly made by

1952.52 --> 1959.559
resonance that was interesting you know

1955.549 --> 1962.299
so that what's that what's that term for

1959.559 --> 1966.02
resonance in the shapes that are formed

1962.299 --> 1967.039
with some frequencies yeah but it's

1966.02 --> 1970.09
that's that's

1967.039 --> 1974.029
that's the watered-down term it's sy

1970.09 --> 1976.49
cymatics cymatic yeah so his suggestion

1974.029 --> 1979.97
was that the crop circles were perhaps

1976.49 --> 1982.7
cymatic results from resonant sounds and

1979.97 --> 1984.019
I was like oh that's kind of interesting

1982.7 --> 1990.47
have you heard anything along those

1984.019 --> 1994.789
lines no but yeah that could be well

1990.47 --> 1997.34
maybe it is kind of the same technology

1994.789 --> 2002.049
as like what is melting these houses and

1997.34 --> 2006.279
cars in California but just more refined

2002.049 --> 2009.429
ly applied anything is possible and

2006.279 --> 2011.679
fluttered yeah with the resonance pretty

2009.429 --> 2015.6100000000001
much that's it the resonance technology

2011.679 --> 2019.99
is so incredibly fast in how it can be

2015.61 --> 2021.34
applied it's an entire world on its own

2019.99 --> 2024.279
what you can basically do with it

2021.34 --> 2027.039
literally and it is from the first

2024.279 --> 2030.34
moment that I got into contact with it

2027.039 --> 2034.09
through my dad mostly it just made me

2030.34 --> 2036.76
nervous because what it entails could

2034.09 --> 2040.0
basically replace pretty much everything

2036.76 --> 2042.61
everything else it's good all freakin be

2040.0 --> 2044.2
resonant space never you're gonna do

2042.61 --> 2048.8089999999997
whatever you're trying to achieve

2044.2 --> 2048.809
it's crazy this

2051.31 --> 2056.97
but yeah it's gonna slowly grow on us

2057.42 --> 2066.67
and change a lot potentially once the

2064.09 --> 2070.92
old things are let go and basically

2066.67 --> 2079.89
replace by all these resonance based

2070.92 --> 2079.89
technologies if they allow of course

2080.61 --> 2085.9
because yeah monopolies especially

2083.56 --> 2088.7799999999997
industry or monopolies don't like to be

2085.9 --> 2092.92
just discarded without any effort you

2088.78 --> 2098.8500000000004
know what I mean so that's gonna be a

2092.92 --> 2098.85
task by itself but we'll get there

2109.24 --> 2120.7599999999998
you guys sell there yeah yeah I'm just

2112.06 --> 2122.64
multitasking no we're trying to write so

2120.76 --> 2133.4100000000003
this cannot be a poop at the same time

2122.64 --> 2133.41
hey hey what's the brush Oh Jose yeah I

2135.36 --> 2147.19
meant sing and play guitar boom very big

2143.26 --> 2150.28
shout out to me THC I it was yesterday

2147.19 --> 2151.84
on the shat on orisha show and I was

2150.28 --> 2154.78
listening to the holy sh t show like a

2151.84 --> 2156.76
midnight and he hooked me up with a

2154.78 --> 2159.61
bunch of his tracks

2156.76 --> 2160.96
it was tracks and beats and stuff he

2159.61 --> 2163.119
hooked me up with a drive you know

2160.96 --> 2165.67
Google Drive we like I don't know 30

2163.119 --> 2169.3500000000004
plus track so are gonna be using him in

2165.67 --> 2172.09
my upcoming videos Thank You MIDI I see

2169.35 --> 2174.63
yeah yeah he's a good guy I met him at

2172.09 --> 2174.63
the conference

2187.57 --> 2195.05
he had the mud flood it's it's a thing

2192.83 --> 2197.24
on its own it's a parent let me just put

2195.05 --> 2200.63
it together the mud flood is basically

2197.24 --> 2204.1699999999996
an infant giant cataclysmic event

2200.63 --> 2209.15
literally a muddler that covered a lot

2204.17 --> 2213.44
of area especially cities and habited

2209.15 --> 2215.7200000000003
area and just the entire landscapes we

2213.44 --> 2217.91
don't exactly know what caused it but it

2215.72 --> 2220.73
happens during the late renaissance

2217.91 --> 2224.54
somewhere right before the

2220.73 --> 2228.8
industrialization and entire cities have

2224.54 --> 2230.75
been covered up burn yeah covered by mud

2228.8 --> 2233.8100000000004
and be been dug up and there's

2230.75 --> 2236.12
photographs of this it's amazing but the

2233.81 --> 2240.83
other photographs of this Monica shows

2236.12 --> 2247.52
them and to this day there are places in

2240.83 --> 2250.37
England that yeah there's like water

2247.52 --> 2254.12
channels and if you would dry them out

2250.37 --> 2256.0099999999998
you would see that there's like old we

2254.12 --> 2259.91
get we would call it Roman style

2256.01 --> 2263.3900000000003
architecture just right there underneath

2259.91 --> 2266.17
the city it's just right there it's like

2263.39 --> 2270.16
what the Frick is that doing there

2266.17 --> 2274.01
nobody just talks about it's like that

2270.16 --> 2277.2799999999997
but it's just things are built right on

2274.01 --> 2281.38
top of this mud flood covered ancient

2277.28 --> 2284.71
city in several locations in Europe and

2281.38 --> 2287.42
maybe other places as well there's a

2284.71 --> 2290.66
presumption also that parts of st.

2287.42 --> 2294.13
Petersburg had been completely flooded

2290.66 --> 2297.7599999999998
in and they just dug it all out again

2294.13 --> 2302.33
that it is really in very ancient city

2297.76 --> 2306.1600000000003
or just very very old and also revealing

2302.33 --> 2310.5499999999997
that in these old times there was just

2306.16 --> 2312.95
marvelous incredible design capabilities

2310.55 --> 2316.7000000000003
for these old buildings

2312.95 --> 2319.52
just fabulous I should architecture that

2316.7 --> 2321.31
we don't we don't even attempt to do

2319.52 --> 2324.46
anything anymore

2321.31 --> 2327.44
so but there's still a lot out there

2324.46 --> 2330.29
although it is being hastily replaced

2327.44 --> 2332.3
with modern crappy architecture just to

2330.29 --> 2335.47
make us forget about what is actually

2332.3 --> 2339.38
possible what is real beauty

2335.47 --> 2342.14
but yeah the mud flood it it happened

2339.38 --> 2345.079
really suddenly everything got buried

2342.14 --> 2347.6299999999997
under mud when people drowned but not

2345.079 --> 2349.19
everyone they a lot has been dug out a

2347.63 --> 2354.13
lot of rulers have used the opportunity

2349.19 --> 2359.03
to just rebuild society from scratch

2354.13 --> 2362.7400000000002
lots of societal changes because of this

2359.03 --> 2364.6400000000003
and that is probably also how the

2362.74 --> 2367.31
industrialization was triggered because

2364.64 --> 2368.96
like yeah it's like literally like mud

2367.31 --> 2373.0099999999998
over clean slate

2368.96 --> 2374.69
for many regions yeah that would

2373.01 --> 2377.38
definitely trigger like getting

2374.69 --> 2379.849
completely experimental with industry

2377.38 --> 2382.94
you know if everything's gone to hell

2379.849 --> 2385.4900000000002
like yeah the old walls gone okay why

2382.94 --> 2387.2200000000003
not try it out something like even

2385.49 --> 2389.81
people that would be really

2387.22 --> 2392.0299999999997
old-fashioned if everything was just

2389.81 --> 2395.089
God's like well okay why not you know

2392.03 --> 2397.19
everything is gone anyway people will be

2395.089 --> 2399.38
more inclined to agree to something

2397.19 --> 2403.31
radical like industrialization

2399.38 --> 2405.71
let's factory the ship and even the

2403.31 --> 2408.349
almost slave labor conditions because

2405.71 --> 2411.44
they would be have to be rebuilding

2408.349 --> 2413.63
everything just like after a giant war

2411.44 --> 2416.089
and everything is everybody is building

2413.63 --> 2418.369
so nobody gives a [ __ ] about slave

2416.089 --> 2420.14
conditions you're trying to rebuild so

2418.369 --> 2422.06
that could explain these types of

2420.14 --> 2424.73
working scenarios also that is a

2422.06 --> 2426.98
response to the mud flood did you talk

2424.73 --> 2428.51
about the kids like the whole pictures

2426.98 --> 2431.63
of child labor and all that that

2428.51 --> 2434.53
everyone neighbor yeah there was huge

2431.63 --> 2438.17
slavery abuse especially in the late

2434.53 --> 2440.42
industrialization if us in the freaking

2438.17 --> 2442.96
factories everyone was in the mines in

2440.42 --> 2446.63
the industry everyone

2442.96 --> 2451.039
it was a great migration into city-type

2446.63 --> 2453.109
life even from more rural living

2451.039 --> 2455.42
Commission's yeah look at some of the

2453.109 --> 2457.46
old pictures from like the 1800s like

2455.42 --> 2460.579
you see all these big cities and streets

2457.46 --> 2462.23
and there's like nobody like there's

2460.579 --> 2464.42
just nobody there compared to what we

2462.23 --> 2466.4
see today's all these buildings

2464.42 --> 2468.98
everywhere and there's just like four

2466.4 --> 2472.069
people walking down a Avenue or

2468.98 --> 2472.46
something it's I always thought that was

2472.069 --> 2474.349
weird

2472.46 --> 2476.15
and then all of a sudden you had this

2474.349 --> 2477.799
immigration to like New York City with

2476.15 --> 2481.4300000000003
these crowded streets and it's such a

2477.799 --> 2487.0389999999998
contrast very strange stuff I don't know

2481.43 --> 2489.44
it's a theory had a mud flood or it's

2487.039 --> 2491.829
not really a theory no I guess it is

2489.44 --> 2494.809
right now contested but there's so much

2491.829 --> 2496.9990000000003
photographic evidence of this well one

2494.809 --> 2498.619
thing that's interesting is uh I would

2496.999 --> 2500.39
suggest take a listen to that max Egan

2498.619 --> 2503.96
thing you've been looking in bed a lot

2500.39 --> 2505.94
lately but uh and I've been looking at

2503.96 --> 2508.579
it even just in China how they how we

2505.94 --> 2512.809
build stuff now to last maybe 20 years

2508.579 --> 2514.67
whereas you look back at stuff that like

2512.809 --> 2516.259
hundred years you know it's like just

2514.67 --> 2519.71
look at what we're building now it looks

2516.259 --> 2525.559
very temporary and then it just looks

2519.71 --> 2528.289
like [ __ ] quick easy it's now all look

2525.559 --> 2535.029
things are now economy driven I have to

2528.289 --> 2538.2490000000003
realize that the economy did Drive

2535.029 --> 2540.529
government in the ancient times yeah

2538.249 --> 2542.9889999999996
that is a good point I mean it's just

2540.529 --> 2545.539
the whole this for me is basically the

2542.989 --> 2547.609
decision-maker so yeah things are going

2545.539 --> 2549.98
to be made quick and cheap and crappy

2547.609 --> 2552.95
because it will yield quick profit and

2549.98 --> 2555.049
just spawn another up because it will be

2552.95 --> 2556.489
turned to [ __ ] it will just found

2555.049 --> 2561.529
another opportunity to do the same

2556.489 --> 2566.239
Oregon yeah so that's the problem by

2561.529 --> 2568.519
economy driven society yeah well I think

2566.239 --> 2569.7490000000003
it's well I think the well economy

2568.519 --> 2571.22
that's I think it's what you're talking

2569.749 --> 2573.819
about is things like planned

2571.22 --> 2573.819
obsolescence

2573.989 --> 2579.309
what's the other I just lost the word

2576.749 --> 2582.2189999999996
but yeah planned obsolesce interest you

2579.309 --> 2584.2290000000003
know what is it Oh exponential growth

2582.219 --> 2586.4790000000003
you know this idea that the economy has

2584.229 --> 2591.5989999999997
to grow grow grow like it's just you

2586.479 --> 2593.979
know this GDP lunatic idea which is

2591.599 --> 2596.819
which is actually something relatively

2593.979 --> 2600.8489999999997
new people always talk about GDP but I

2596.819 --> 2603.369
think it's a US based ideology that was

2600.849 --> 2606.46
after I mean it hasn't been around that

2603.369 --> 2609.489
long I forgot it's not a it's not in the

2606.46 --> 2612.339
law of economics like they like people

2609.489 --> 2616.69
might believe long no it's just a

2612.339 --> 2620.7889999999998
philosophy a philosophical approach the

2616.69 --> 2624.64
greed based economy economic society

2620.789 --> 2626.559
yeah I think there was like the 50s or

2624.64 --> 2628.9
60s or something yeah I mean I was after

2626.559 --> 2633.219
World War two it started in the US and I

2628.9 --> 2636.67
guess everybody's adopted it no not

2633.219 --> 2639.069
everyone but yeah it is coming naturally

2636.67 --> 2643.619
to being because of greed and because of

2639.069 --> 2647.829
the social stigma being taken off greed

2643.619 --> 2650.2290000000003
in a very hypocritical way because greed

2647.829 --> 2652.63
is now just like everything has been

2650.229 --> 2654.7889999999998
politicized like it's super okay to be

2652.63 --> 2656.4100000000003
greedy it's really kind of almost funny

2654.789 --> 2658.029
if you're on the right side but if

2656.41 --> 2661.66
you're on the wrong side then you are

2658.029 --> 2664.589
toes will say to me I win are you a mod

2661.66 --> 2667.5389999999998
person because P Mars hate mod people

2664.589 --> 2669.249
better not go in there in the wrong side

2667.539 --> 2672.279
you don't say you are a mod person

2669.249 --> 2680.3489999999997
because P Mars hate modern people like

2672.279 --> 2682.509
that like mad people yeah you know that

2680.349 --> 2685.6600000000003
a weird is only very healthy for the

2682.509 --> 2688.779
skin right there's like professional mud

2685.66 --> 2690.39
baths it's like really nice have you

2688.779 --> 2694.079
ever tried it

2690.39 --> 2698.92
yeah what is good for the skin it is

2694.079 --> 2702.46
like volcanic mud has a huge amounts of

2698.92 --> 2704.589
minerals and everything in it it's

2702.46 --> 2706.38
really dirty and smelly but it's really

2704.589 --> 2711.0
really healthy

2706.38 --> 2715.2000000000003
so yeah I love mud and used to love mud

2711.0 --> 2717.51
as a kid yeah we they are what do you

2715.2 --> 2720.1699999999996
think a lot of a lot of people talking

2717.51 --> 2724.86
about mud flood or kind of as a reset

2720.17 --> 2727.53
kind of they also there's a sentiment

2724.86 --> 2730.13
that says all this technology we have

2727.53 --> 2732.57
this Wi-Fi and some smart all this crap

2730.13 --> 2738.2400000000002
we say it's always been here actually

2732.57 --> 2744.3900000000003
it's not something that's magical

2738.24 --> 2747.99
innovation that's always been here no no

2744.39 --> 2751.2
what we're honest please new I think so

2747.99 --> 2754.74
yeah it is electronics is absolutely

2751.2 --> 2760.68
unique there were basic concepts of it

2754.74 --> 2763.56
maybe maybe early like secrecy espionage

2760.68 --> 2766.95
whatever maybe listening devices things

2763.56 --> 2768.93
like that could you could but real

2766.95 --> 2772.5299999999997
electronics the way we apply it no

2768.93 --> 2777.3199999999997
that's never been done before in an

2772.53 --> 2777.32
ancient history I believe no signs of it

2777.83 --> 2782.75
that's something I don't know I look at

2780.15 --> 2785.94
like if you really look no clock works

2782.75 --> 2789.47
incredible clock works it was a chemical

2785.94 --> 2793.53
masters they didn't need electronic

2789.47 --> 2795.0899999999997
I actually think that when you look at

2793.53 --> 2797.9700000000003
these things like the pyramids and these

2795.09 --> 2800.1000000000004
I think it was done with harmonics and

2797.97 --> 2807.1499999999996
levitation or I don't know it's just

2800.1 --> 2809.49
amazing it I think Billy just giant it's

2807.15 --> 2812.7000000000003
easier you go for the Giants

2809.49 --> 2816.3599999999997
yeah you know that's a big advantage you

2812.7 --> 2820.74
can take sleeves dragging a giant rock

2816.36 --> 2823.8
on the bunch of a bunch of trees rolling

2820.74 --> 2825.6899999999996
it up specially designed slope to get it

2823.8 --> 2827.5800000000004
there or you could just have a freaking

2825.69 --> 2832.62
giant and pick it up and just put it in

2827.58 --> 2835.5299999999997
the place you know that would kind of

2832.62 --> 2838.02
spawn situations where people will see

2835.53 --> 2839.5800000000004
okay yeah I guess it's pretty easy to

2838.02 --> 2843.31
make a pyramid let's

2839.58 --> 2845.89
300 more instead of oh my god this is

2843.31 --> 2849.48
taken like a hundred two hundred years

2845.89 --> 2852.52
yeah that's make three hundred more no

2849.48 --> 2854.98
that's yeah there's definitely something

2852.52 --> 2856.87
missing with the dummy numbers good

2854.98 --> 2858.4900000000002
honest the whole history a lot of people

2856.87 --> 2865.54
are getting on this history thing being

2858.49 --> 2868.8599999999997
uh just nonsense right now pyramids I

2865.54 --> 2872.38
believe they were not super quickly made

2868.86 --> 2874.51
like it's like a building project but

2872.38 --> 2878.08
yeah it wasn't that hard and it's not

2874.51 --> 2880.2700000000004
hard if you have giants okay then you

2878.08 --> 2883.33
can put things into place very quickly

2880.27 --> 2887.11
you can whole massive incredibly massive

2883.33 --> 2889.93
things very quickly with you go trouble

2887.11 --> 2891.19
you go with the giant tree stone thing I

2889.93 --> 2894.3599999999997
guess if you're going down the jack

2891.19 --> 2897.61
giant thing no it's it's off another age

2894.36 --> 2902.1400000000003
might have been might I'm not excluding

2897.61 --> 2906.4900000000002
it but it's not that age the Atlantean

2902.14 --> 2908.83
age is far past the one those giant

2906.49 --> 2912.1899999999996
trees I think the Atlanta age came to

2908.83 --> 2915.97
being out of that they're the Atlanteans

2912.19 --> 2918.01
were the the right before the flood they

2915.97 --> 2921.27
were the ones probably that have

2918.01 --> 2923.8
completely taken down the trees and

2921.27 --> 2926.17
industrialized the world in their way

2923.8 --> 2929.23
and built the pyramids and did all kinds

2926.17 --> 2932.38
of things but I think that they are the

2929.23 --> 2935.43
ones that are richly harvested most of

2932.38 --> 2937.7200000000003
the Ancients the super ancient world

2935.43 --> 2941.08
have you looked into that this country

2937.72 --> 2946.12
that existed again next week is a tart

2941.08 --> 2948.13
area mm-hmm yes and he's suggesting that

2946.12 --> 2951.13
a lot of these wars World War one has

2948.13 --> 2952.9500000000003
been even the Iraq Wars or have been

2951.13 --> 2957.28
actually about trying to erase this

2952.95 --> 2963.25
civilization just wipe it out that could

2957.28 --> 2966.07
definitely have been involved yes it's

2963.25 --> 2969.03
very sick sickening to think about that

2966.07 --> 2969.03
yeah

2970.63 --> 2976.85
can you tell me a little bit more about

2972.83 --> 2980.39
the tart airings what did you there are

2976.85 --> 2982.16
some there are some some maps that have

2980.39 --> 2986.33
been found like some you know that were

2982.16 --> 2988.16
pretty recent like us made based maps

2986.33 --> 2989.9
that had flipped different flags of

2988.16 --> 2993.2599999999998
different and chart areas one of all but

2989.9 --> 2993.8
it's not in our but what the country and

2993.26 --> 2996.7400000000002
the people

2993.8 --> 3001.6000000000004
where was it what was it like what type

2996.74 --> 3007.2999999999997
of culture I don't I haven't looked into

3001.6 --> 3009.36
it that much myself you know but yeah

3007.3 --> 3015.57
the name sounds very familiar aids I

3009.36 --> 3019.06
heard about it like a long time ago so

3015.57 --> 3022.06
it's just strange that there's seems to

3019.06 --> 3024.61
be some remnants of this tart area flag

3022.06 --> 3027.13
and yet it's not in uh I don't know it's

3024.61 --> 3030.1600000000003
just weird stuff that okay so why isn't

3027.13 --> 3034.2000000000003
this taught like was it a place it

3030.16 --> 3034.2
wasn't it why would it be on a map I

3037.92 --> 3041.59
mean I don't know I've always loved

3040.21 --> 3043.09
history it's like that the whole thing

3041.59 --> 3045.2200000000003
being taught Columbus discovered America

3043.09 --> 3048.88
as a child I'm thinking how do you

3045.22 --> 3050.5
discover a place with people and and

3048.88 --> 3052.32
then we learned later that the Chinese

3050.5 --> 3055.84
have been here and obviously the

3052.32 --> 3057.9100000000003
Scandinavian the Vikings and oh yeah but

3055.84 --> 3060.82
the European elite didn't know the land

3057.91 --> 3065.68
was there so King Ferdinand sent Queen

3060.82 --> 3070.21
sent Columbus Kota in Djibouti Chris

3065.68 --> 3074.2599999999998
story his whole thing it's just it's

3070.21 --> 3077.38
just Empire Empire and in the big excuse

3074.26 --> 3078.4900000000002
very convenient and easier I mean I

3077.38 --> 3081.4
don't I don't doubt that the average

3078.49 --> 3083.35
European back then had no idea I don't

3081.4 --> 3087.13
have anything outside you can't tell me

3083.35 --> 3088.93
that the ruling Kings and the priests

3087.13 --> 3092.17
and churches didn't have these met

3088.93 --> 3094.7999999999997
that's nonsense no they probably had an

3092.17 --> 3097.9
idea there was something out there right

3094.8 --> 3100.3300000000004
that Europeans probably know but the

3097.9 --> 3101.26
Europeans especially at first would go

3100.33 --> 3103.66
along with it

3101.26 --> 3107.3500000000004
cause like the Queen of Spain and

3103.66 --> 3109.7799999999997
Portugal they would actually promise the

3107.35 --> 3112.12
public like yeah we will conquer these

3109.78 --> 3115.8
lands and make them part of the Empire

3112.12 --> 3118.95
and you will get the riches also and

3115.8 --> 3121.78
yeah that makes the public very

3118.95 --> 3124.18
enthusiastic at least at first the

3121.78 --> 3129.27
promise is still fresh to basically

3124.18 --> 3133.1499999999996
engage into Empire and they did

3129.27 --> 3135.37
that's the colonization what's the

3133.15 --> 3138.01
promise yeah you'll be getting will all

3135.37 --> 3142.12
be rich everybody will be will be having

3138.01 --> 3143.7700000000004
good clothes and have nice food well

3142.12 --> 3146.35
here's a good article says the official

3143.77 --> 3148.24
history is hiding a major world power

3146.35 --> 3151.5699999999997
which existed as late as the 19th

3148.24 --> 3155.2599999999998
century and yeah yeah no I mean there

3151.57 --> 3161.29
are maps like 1818 something like party

3155.26 --> 3162.76
really right yeah I think it's it's

3161.29 --> 3164.65
looking like something happened that

3162.76 --> 3166.5400000000004
right around this birth that you know

3164.65 --> 3168.4300000000003
the Industrial Revolution will be just

3166.54 --> 3172.12
jump into all this you know steam engine

3168.43 --> 3175.6
and technology and electricity to all

3172.12 --> 3179.0099999999998
this craft right it was already there

3175.6 --> 3183.67
but it was now going to be applied by

3179.01 --> 3184.0
industrialists basically no it was a new

3183.67 --> 3188.62
age

3184.0 --> 3191.74
and the big-money people and inventors

3188.62 --> 3193.3599999999997
basically decided it for society like

3191.74 --> 3195.1
okay yeah we're gonna do this now now

3193.36 --> 3200.19
it's gonna be yeah it was out there now

3195.1 --> 3200.19
we're gonna actually apply it to society

3200.31 --> 3206.17
here is a link of anybody who's very

3203.47 --> 3208.5299999999997
interesting stuff hold on where's the

3206.17 --> 3214.02
I'll put it in hang out all right in the

3208.53 --> 3214.02
right here and I'm

3220.46 --> 3225.59
yeah yeah I will definitely check that

3223.98 --> 3227.46
out

3225.59 --> 3232.9500000000003
familiar picture there

3227.46 --> 3234.27
oh yeah that's that uh a lot of people

3232.95 --> 3236.31
use this that's supposedly the North

3234.27 --> 3240.48
Pole and what is this eat some people

3236.31 --> 3243.17
say it's he did Garden of Eden and I

3240.48 --> 3243.17
don't know

3245.54 --> 3250.95
did you see that image that I put in the

3249.06 --> 3254.7
chat a couple of days ago remember I

3250.95 --> 3256.5
told you I had the Reader's Digest world

3254.7 --> 3258.75
atlas where they had that satellite

3256.5 --> 3262.5
picture of the top down from the North

3258.75 --> 3264.27
Pole right what yeah did your did you

3262.5 --> 3272.19
ever see that I posted that in the chat

3264.27 --> 3273.72
I think I did I don't remember I think

3272.19 --> 3276.93
it's been a couple of days so I don't

3273.72 --> 3278.97
know how many comments have been made

3276.93 --> 3280.3799999999997
since then but I suppose I could I think

3278.97 --> 3282.4199999999996
I still have it on my phone so let me

3280.38 --> 3284.67
look and see how they put it again we're

in chats that's what I'm saying I don't

3284.67 --> 3288.4500000000003
remember because it's got a couple of

3286.29 --> 3291.72
days but it's not yeah I can't find it
