74.72 --> 78.64
from now on i think i'm gonna re try to

77.28 --> 80.08
rearrange it and it's going to be a

78.64 --> 80.88
hassle because that means i'm going to

80.08 --> 84.24
have to

80.88 --> 84.24
rearrange my intro

85.759 --> 93.119
my thing but

88.799 --> 97.04
things have got to change because yeah

93.119 --> 100.32

that would be much appreciated

117.2 --> 119.43900000000001
right

122.719 --> 129.84
the weather today is

125.84 --> 129.84
it's still kind of cloudy

130.08 --> 135.84
it feels colder than it did yesterday

133.84 --> 138.48
but i haven't actually even checked the

135.84 --> 140.31900000000002
temperature to compare it

138.48 --> 143.599
but it's a little less clouded or the

140.319 --> 146.72
clouds seem higher up

143.599 --> 146.72
not so close by

149.52 --> 152.48000000000002
there's no sun

152.879 --> 157.84
to be found anywhere but oh well

158.239 --> 160.48000000000002
right

167.84 --> 172.31900000000002
right so apologies for unexpectedly

171.519 --> 176.56
starting at

172.319 --> 178.159
2 p.m amsterdam time instead of 1 p.m

176.56 --> 180.56
[Music]

178.159 --> 181.599
really what started this is that i just

180.56 --> 184.72
i woke up

181.599 --> 186.23899999999998
after one so

184.72 --> 188.239
originally i was going to completely

186.239 --> 191.59900000000002
cancel the show

188.239 --> 196.0
for this saturday but

191.599 --> 196.0
i reconsidered also because

197.04 --> 204.0
adam skyped me or like

200.64 --> 204.0
chatted me up with skype

204.4 --> 209.519
so i thought okay i'll just do a little

206.64 --> 214.64
one-hour show

209.519 --> 214.64000000000001
hope still somebody is around out there

215.84 --> 219.12
to join me in chat

221.04 --> 230.0
right otherwise just do without

226.799 --> 230.0
thinking that maybe

233.519 --> 241.84
instead of yeah i originally started out

238.319 --> 241.83999999999997
kind of

243.36 --> 249.28
encouraging that the chat to

246.48 --> 250.23899999999998
really interact with it but i think that

249.28 --> 252.64000000000001
i've

250.239 --> 254.48000000000002
made myself a little over dependent on

252.64 --> 256.71999999999997
the chat

254.48 --> 260.4
i used to be able to function completely

256.72 --> 264.24
without it's just that a lot of

260.4 --> 266.4
good influence has come through the chat

264.24 --> 268.08
so i wanted to make it a bit more part

266.4 --> 271.28
of the show but it's not

268.08 --> 271.75899999999996
always rolling so i have to fake our way

271.28 --> 274.32
out

271.759 --> 274.32
through that

276.08 --> 283.84
hey adam mikken good to see you

287.44 --> 297.04
all right so made a lot of notes for

289.199 --> 301.44
yesterday at least

297.04 --> 303.199
right yeah yesterday's flat earth debate

301.44 --> 306.88
was really intense

303.199 --> 309.36
and really good i watched it back

306.88 --> 310.15999999999997
even after the live show before anything

309.36 --> 312.16
premiered

310.16 --> 313.44
and it's probably going to premiere well

312.16 --> 315.91900000000004
it is going to premiere

313.44 --> 317.6
this sunday i'm pretty sure but it was

315.919 --> 321.12
pretty good

317.6 --> 321.12
and it was there for most of it

322.4 --> 325.84
hey stone monkey 3d

326.56 --> 331.199
right but then like during the after

329.039 --> 331.759
show i kind of went out for groceries

331.199 --> 333.52000000000004
hope to

331.759 --> 336.40000000000003
get back quick while that didn't happen

333.52 --> 339.28
at all because i bumped into

336.4 --> 340.0
just some random person at the coffee

339.28 --> 342.88
shop

340.0 --> 344.32
waiting outside and the weather was kind

342.88 --> 346.96
of nice so

344.32 --> 347.59999999999997
and we kind of started a spontaneous

346.96 --> 350.23999999999995
talk

347.6 --> 352.24
pretty elaborately and that to me these

350.24 --> 355.28000000000003
days is like a rare opportunity

352.24 --> 355.919
and i regarded it as such i think the

355.28 --> 359.919
guy did

355.919 --> 364.24
too and because he was a nurse

359.919 --> 366.88
like really professional and

364.24 --> 367.28000000000003
it was to me like oh that's somebody

366.88 --> 369.68
like

367.28 --> 371.52
in there like what is it like i knew a

369.68 --> 375.919
nurse who was a roommate but

371.52 --> 375.919
yeah he moved out like over it

376.319 --> 381.68
yeah way over maybe like two years ago

379.919 --> 383.75899999999996
he was really cool

381.68 --> 385.039
i talked about him during the show even

383.759 --> 386.8
a little here there no

385.039 --> 389.44
was it a year ago i don't know time

386.8 --> 391.36
flies it's hard to separate like the

389.44 --> 394.16
situation that happens

391.36 --> 394.56
in here in the real world with this how

394.16 --> 396.88000000000005
the

394.56 --> 398.56
house and the people and then cross

396.88 --> 399.44
referencing it with what's been

398.56 --> 401.199
happening

399.44 --> 403.6
in the flatter scene and all that is

401.199 --> 407.84000000000003
like two different types of time

403.6 --> 410.72
and sometimes it mismatches for me

407.84 --> 414.31899999999996
but yes at least over a year ago but

410.72 --> 414.319
anyway i had to talk with this guy

415.52 --> 421.599
and really wanted to test him like okay

418.88 --> 423.44
especially about the vaccine like what

421.599 --> 426.71999999999997
did he know about it

423.44 --> 427.12
because he was he was probably due to

426.72 --> 430.08000000000004
his

427.12 --> 431.599
nurse training being very accepting so

430.08 --> 434.31899999999996
his entire

431.599 --> 435.759
attitude seemed to be crystallized in

434.319 --> 438.16
like

435.759 --> 440.319
accepting whatever people are gonna say

438.16 --> 442.8
and then try to pick something careful

440.319 --> 445.36
which is a very good

442.8 --> 446.40000000000003
yeah some careful good position in it

445.36 --> 449.12
right it's a

446.4 --> 449.599
good way to go about so the guy was

449.12 --> 453.12
pretty

449.599 --> 456.24
yeah he was a pretty happy guy

453.12 --> 460.0
he was i think a bit rasta kind of a fan

456.24 --> 461.84000000000003
of african things he was a

460.0 --> 464.319
white guy definitely like a dutch white

461.84 --> 467.44
guy but he was into that and he had like

464.319 --> 471.03900000000004
long hair and one of these typical or

467.44 --> 471.039
like rasta type hats

472.08 --> 474.96
what do you call that

477.28 --> 480.96
like it was cut like it's almost like he

479.68 --> 484.0
had this colored

480.96 --> 487.12
basket on his head what is that style

484.0 --> 489.52
i don't know how to call that but it was

487.12 --> 492.479
a pretty cool guy

489.52 --> 493.599
hey anyway as getting wisdom in chat

492.479 --> 495.919
here we go again

493.599 --> 496.8
good to see you all coming in sorry for

495.919 --> 500.0
the late show

496.8 --> 502.16
but yeah i think i'm gonna do that from

500.0 --> 505.28
now on

502.16 --> 506.56
give myself a little bit of room in the

505.28 --> 510.31899999999996
morning this

506.56 --> 513.52
yeah to sleep in

510.319 --> 513.52
what they call it i think

514.08 --> 520.88
i'm still working on my english

517.599 --> 526.0
it's very difficult sometimes

520.88 --> 526.0
and i notice also that depending on

526.8 --> 530.16
what you're doing can get a lot better

529.36 --> 534.5600000000001
at it

530.16 --> 537.519
at the mechanics but still

534.56 --> 541.1199999999999
my english is not just spontaneously

537.519 --> 541.12
perfect every single time

541.2 --> 544.48
so there's still growing room i gotta

543.279 --> 546.72
get better

544.48 --> 547.76
gotta get better at what i do whatever

546.72 --> 553.12
it is

547.76 --> 556.16
right the hat is called a tam

553.12 --> 556.16
right okay

558.72 --> 563.839
let's check that

567.6 --> 574.08
uh no

570.88 --> 577.8389999999999
i don't no not that type of hat

574.08 --> 577.839
that's a different style

583.12 --> 589.519
maybe it is just a rasta hat

586.24 --> 590.0
yeah i think it it was literally just a

589.519 --> 593.04
rasta

590.0 --> 595.44
hat when i

593.04 --> 596.16
googled that word that's exactly like

595.44 --> 599.7600000000001
what it was

596.16 --> 602.079
so yeah the

599.76 --> 604.8
tam hat is interesting that that's it

602.079 --> 605.1999999999999
from a different era and i've seen that

604.8 --> 608.4799999999999
as

605.2 --> 608.48
very cute type of hats

609.519 --> 616.32
yeah you spelled it correctly here we go

612.16 --> 616.3199999999999
again i looked it up it's not a tam hat

617.519 --> 624.8
right it was a rust that whatever

620.959 --> 628.3199999999999
um anyway

624.8 --> 630.079
i was able to prevent yeah unleashing

628.32 --> 633.12
flat earth on this guy even though i

630.079 --> 635.1999999999999
i almost like really wanted to but i

633.12 --> 637.92
think it would have

635.2 --> 638.9590000000001
tensed up things too much because he was

637.92 --> 644.0
a little bit tense

638.959 --> 646.279
like he expressed and radiated that

644.0 --> 648.72
he too was getting like sick of the

646.279 --> 652.079
manipulations everywhere

648.72 --> 654.72
and i could even without him

652.079 --> 656.88
telling about it in a literal sense

654.72 --> 660.32
giving specific examples we were both

656.88 --> 661.12
avoiding specific examples right but he

660.32 --> 665.519
also as

661.12 --> 668.5600000000001
i basically did my thing he reflected

665.519 --> 671.6
that he realized

668.56 --> 674.079
that he had caught up in lies and did

671.6 --> 677.0400000000001
not know

674.079 --> 678.56
couldn't control it like he was caught

677.04 --> 680.399
up in the spell and i got

678.56 --> 681.68
signs of that from him in my

680.399 --> 684.72
communication it

681.68 --> 688.2399999999999
it's very complicated like i

684.72 --> 691.0400000000001
it's it's very spiritual

688.24 --> 691.519
it's just the way people respond right

691.04 --> 694.48
but i

691.519 --> 696.32
i i went forth and explained to him

694.48 --> 698.64
completely

696.32 --> 700.9590000000001
my idea about viruses and the common

698.64 --> 701.76
cold and like how a vaccine can never

700.959 --> 704.079
work

701.76 --> 705.2
and that this vaccine is not technically

704.079 --> 707.5999999999999
a vaccine it's

705.2 --> 709.44
just a medical experiment and i laid

707.6 --> 713.519
that down really concisely

709.44 --> 717.36
perfectly i'm very proud of that and

713.519 --> 719.04
he was like whoa well he didn't express

717.36 --> 722.72
it like that he was kind of silent

719.04 --> 724.48
but i knew like he didn't have a direct

722.72 --> 725.2
rollout response for it he didn't have

724.48 --> 728.839
like oh that's

725.2 --> 732.0790000000001
conspiracy theorist response

728.839 --> 734.1600000000001
so i might have handed him

732.079 --> 736.16
something really interesting that he

734.16 --> 739.279
might start digging in

736.16 --> 740.8
that he was ready for it i hope so who

739.279 --> 742.959
knows

740.8 --> 744.639
at least i i gave him something for the

742.959 --> 747.8389999999999
back of his mind

744.639 --> 749.6800000000001
to reflect the ideas of viruses on

747.839 --> 751.2790000000001
because i i laid it out pretty well so

749.68 --> 753.5999999999999
that happened but because of that

751.279 --> 755.519
yeah i did kind of like stay outside for

753.6 --> 755.9200000000001
like an hour talking with this guy and i

755.519 --> 758.72
missed

755.92 --> 761.1999999999999
the rest of the after show but it was

758.72 --> 761.2
worth it

761.279 --> 765.76
it was really interesting to have just a

763.76 --> 767.4399999999999
face-to-face conversation with somebody

765.76 --> 770.8
again

767.44 --> 772.8000000000001
and also talking about like

770.8 --> 774.7199999999999
being too much on the internet and this

772.8 --> 778.3599999999999
guy was very he apparently

774.72 --> 780.72
has learned of many people that are

778.36 --> 783.6
problematically getting addicted to

780.72 --> 787.519
media because

783.6 --> 790.5600000000001
yeah i think they're allowed to do less

787.519 --> 792.72
outside or so they perceive people are

790.56 --> 795.76
doing less outside

792.72 --> 797.839
and then they get stuck to just watching

795.76 --> 800.8
some media out of boredom and get

797.839 --> 802.5600000000001
stuck on things or on conspiracy

800.8 --> 804.399
theories and there's a lot of really

802.56 --> 807.92
stupid and bad

804.399 --> 808.8
narratives out there that are super over

807.92 --> 811.279
simplified

808.8 --> 813.4399999999999
and just hyping it up constantly driving

811.279 --> 817.04
you nuts not really providing any

813.44 --> 820.639
any viable solutions and people

817.04 --> 822.639
kind of spiral with that i've always

820.639 --> 824.32
for a long time avoided that every time

822.639 --> 827.839
i noticed like this

824.32 --> 830.8000000000001
this just doesn't sound good at

827.839 --> 832.8000000000001
even though what is being said may be

830.8 --> 835.8389999999999
true in ways and

832.8 --> 840.7199999999999
it's got a point if it just if it's

835.839 --> 843.7600000000001
put down with just a hype vibe

840.72 --> 845.1990000000001
and trying to be very attention grabby

843.76 --> 847.199
constantly

845.199 --> 848.88
then it's no good it's not going to be

847.199 --> 851.4399999999999
good and like

848.88 --> 856.0
the attention behind it cannot be good

851.44 --> 857.839
it is kind of manipulative then

856.0 --> 859.519
it's been engineered to be more

857.839 --> 861.839
manipulative

859.519 --> 863.519
and that's just not good it's not good

861.839 --> 864.1600000000001
for anybody it's not good to sit through

863.519 --> 867.92
that it's not

864.16 --> 871.519
good to latch on to that

867.92 --> 875.12
it's like drugs

871.519 --> 878.32
instead of just slowly learning

875.12 --> 880.8
things taking your time letting

878.32 --> 885.839
things gradually sink in it's just being

880.8 --> 885.8389999999999
pushed pushed pushed pushed

886.32 --> 899.839
right well this is typical media anyway

888.88 --> 902.88
the mainstream media is the master at it

899.839 --> 904.9590000000001
right oh here we go again he actually

902.88 --> 906.24
defended vexi that's like the first

904.959 --> 910.7199999999999
thing he opened up with

906.24 --> 912.8
that's why i had to roll it all out

910.72 --> 914.72
like he didn't trust the corona vaccine

912.8 --> 917.04
but he was all like yeah i heard on the

914.72 --> 920.24
news somebody got a vaccine

917.04 --> 922.399
and it was supposedly said that

920.24 --> 923.6800000000001
she was killed but there was she got

922.399 --> 926.16
better

923.68 --> 928.4799999999999
so i don't know how or where he got that

926.16 --> 928.48
from

928.959 --> 934.3199999999999
but it seemed yeah blurry at best

937.36 --> 944.399
so i had to lay out some things

941.44 --> 944.9590000000001
all right and it's funny also because he

944.399 --> 949.04
made me

944.959 --> 952.959
kind of like come out

949.04 --> 954.56
that like he was emphasizing yeah like

952.959 --> 957.5189999999999
people leave it need a lot of help

954.56 --> 959.8389999999999
that's why i got it became a nurse

957.519 --> 960.8
and i'm good that face to face and all

959.839 --> 964.24
that

960.8 --> 967.92
he's very good at it it probably is

964.24 --> 970.8
right and he's very caring compacted

967.92 --> 974.24
person in the spirit so

970.8 --> 976.399
and i said yeah i am like

974.24 --> 978.0
in a ways the opposite i am about the

976.399 --> 980.079
internet i am about internet

978.0 --> 981.92
communication

980.079 --> 983.7589999999999
i work really well with it it's like

981.92 --> 986.0
yeah i became addicted to the computer

983.759 --> 987.36
very young that was very problematic in

986.0 --> 989.92
ways

987.36 --> 989.92
but then

990.399 --> 998.24
yeah not really being able to like

994.24 --> 1000.399
go back and do it in another way

998.24 --> 1003.279
i just decided okay i'll just try to

1000.399 --> 1006.399
master things on that computer

1003.279 --> 1009.36
maybe yeah

1006.399 --> 1010.0
do this what i'm doing right now and at

1009.36 --> 1013.519
it

1010.0 --> 1016.16
i work on psychology so in a layman

1013.519 --> 1018.399
way i am a psychologist i'm a

1016.16 --> 1021.92
psychologist towards myself

1018.399 --> 1025.039
and towards others also but yeah not

1021.92 --> 1026.559
in a traditional sense right i try to

1025.039 --> 1029.919
make people conscious of

1026.559 --> 1033.6789999999999
psychological things so that they

1029.919 --> 1036.8390000000002
can try to master

1033.679 --> 1039.439
it themselves

1036.839 --> 1042.0
right and that was basically my

1039.439 --> 1045.439
justification against his

1042.0 --> 1045.439
yeah his career defense

1046.079 --> 1051.6
like okay yeah i do do some things it's

1049.28 --> 1052.32
just a matter of whether i declare it or

1051.6 --> 1055.039
not

1052.32 --> 1056.24
because to me it's so weird in in a way

1055.039 --> 1058.96
now it's like yeah

1056.24 --> 1060.16
i'm doing this and that determines my

1058.96 --> 1064.4
value

1060.16 --> 1067.52
that process that's out there a lot

1064.4 --> 1068.72
i grew up in that and and for me it's

1067.52 --> 1072.799
always been like no i

1068.72 --> 1075.919
just do things i just do my

1072.799 --> 1080.96
if i stamp him if i

1075.919 --> 1084.48
give a boxed out type of value to

1080.96 --> 1088.4
whatever i do that's almost problematic

1084.48 --> 1093.039
because it distracts you away from

1088.4 --> 1096.64
the the fluidness of the dynamics of it

1093.039 --> 1096.64
you just declare specifically

1098.16 --> 1100.48
right

1101.28 --> 1106.6399999999999
so i tend to avoid that

1104.559 --> 1108.32
even though i might use it in the moment

1106.64 --> 1110.0
of kind of like bragging or when

1108.32 --> 1110.8799999999999
somebody when a troll comes in and

1110.0 --> 1113.6
starts saying

1110.88 --> 1115.2
what have you ever done yeah then i will

1113.6 --> 1118.799
absolutely suddenly

1115.2 --> 1119.2
pile it all up because if i need to i

1118.799 --> 1121.12
can

1119.2 --> 1125.039
think of these things i just don't

1121.12 --> 1125.039
concern myself all day with it

1125.2 --> 1127.44
right

1134.84 --> 1138.32
hello yeah

1138.96 --> 1151.8400000000001
come back with a better name seriously

1153.99 --> 1157.19
[Music]

1158.16 --> 1165.8400000000001
all right there's my first banning

1167.12 --> 1170.32
because everybody is unblocked i don't

1169.28 --> 1173.84
know if

1170.32 --> 1177.039
if people took notice of that

1173.84 --> 1180.1599999999999
mentioned it yesterday my show

1177.039 --> 1183.44
but i erased my entire

1180.16 --> 1193.2
blocked list pp

1183.44 --> 1195.039
is a gun

1193.2 --> 1199.039
i don't know what that means i'll unhide

1195.039 --> 1199.039
him again i just didn't like the name

1200.24 --> 1208.159
i felt it was a troll jab

1203.52 --> 1208.1589999999999
at me i don't know maybe it's wrong

1208.88 --> 1212.48
maybe this is just what people do now

1211.52 --> 1221.36
just

1212.48 --> 1224.48
think of crazy names

1221.36 --> 1227.52
what i do instead as

1224.48 --> 1232.159
as being on the internet a person

1227.52 --> 1237.9189999999999
i just try to be myself

1232.159 --> 1249.8400000000001
and not hide under really weird names

1237.919 --> 1249.8400000000001
i don't know that's just me

1254.08 --> 1257.4399999999998
yeah and i don't know what you mean with

1255.919 --> 1260.159
your response there either

1257.44 --> 1263.8400000000001
george sanford i have no idea this is

1260.159 --> 1263.8400000000001
not a coherent sentence

1281.919 --> 1284.3200000000002
all right

1287.84 --> 1292.24
yeah over sexualization of the world

1290.159 --> 1305.8400000000001
yeah i think that's

1292.24 --> 1305.84
i really don't like it

1309.36 --> 1317.6
okay sure jared sanford

1312.559 --> 1321.12
i get it pp bison is a small machine gun

1317.6 --> 1321.12
right whatever

1325.36 --> 1329.4399999999998
yeah bad name nice caring comment

1327.36 --> 1330.84
classic troll exactly here we go again

1329.44 --> 1333.3600000000001
that's why i did it

1330.84 --> 1334.6399999999999
but i think it was just a one-time

1333.36 --> 1336.08
message because even though i

1334.64 --> 1338.0800000000002
unblocked it again there's no other

1336.08 --> 1340.32
message so it was just somebody doing

1338.08 --> 1340.32
that

1341.28 --> 1346.32
even though they could technically just

1344.24 --> 1349.919
say hello

1346.32 --> 1361.84
in my chat because nobody's blocked

1349.919 --> 1361.8400000000001
right not even the troll

1362.48 --> 1365.679
hello bobby stills

1367.28 --> 1374.72
right so anyway that happened good

1372.84 --> 1378.799
conversation

1374.72 --> 1378.799
hot way too hot ouch

1380.0 --> 1383.919
but good conversations out there in the

1382.32 --> 1387.2
real world

1383.919 --> 1388.24
it's been a long time it's been a long

1387.2 --> 1391.1200000000001
time

1388.24 --> 1391.1200000000001
i i missed it

1391.76 --> 1398.96
like in 2019 i had

1395.039 --> 1401.76
i think at least two hands full

1398.96 --> 1403.76
or one handful at least general

1401.76 --> 1408.1589999999999
conversations

1403.76 --> 1410.24
also about conspiracy things like

1408.159 --> 1412.24
typically at the coffee shop or behind

1410.24 --> 1414.08
the coffee shop somewhere

1412.24 --> 1415.6
i don't know i bump into a lot of people

1414.08 --> 1417.76
that are ready for intelligent

1415.6 --> 1419.6
conversations

1417.76 --> 1421.44
over there for some reason it's the

1419.6 --> 1423.1999999999998
place where i bump into it

1421.44 --> 1426.159
and had many of these conversations but

1423.2 --> 1431.8400000000001
this one has been like

1426.159 --> 1431.8400000000001
one out of two in a year

1432.159 --> 1439.8200000000002
it's been very little it's drying up

1436.62 --> 1439.82
[Music]

1440.64 --> 1448.72
and so i took yeah i made the best of it

1445.2 --> 1450.0800000000002
it was almost like a real performance

1448.72 --> 1452.4
thing in the moment

1450.08 --> 1453.6789999999999
because because i hadn't because i

1452.4 --> 1456.5590000000002
rarely do it

1453.679 --> 1456.5590000000002
and that is also

1456.96 --> 1461.2
another thing about me and this show

1459.12 --> 1465.36
doing it every day and doing it two

1461.2 --> 1469.3600000000001
hours is like i feel a little stretched

1465.36 --> 1471.84
thin sometimes and it's also why then

1469.36 --> 1474.32
at some point might completely stop

1471.84 --> 1474.32
talking

1476.08 --> 1480.8799999999999
and yeah well because of this again it's

1478.72 --> 1483.1200000000001
a reason why i decided in the weekends

1480.88 --> 1484.88
i'm gonna start at 2 pm and just do a

1483.12 --> 1486.7199999999998
one hour show

1484.88 --> 1488.96
it's funny that way because i originally

1486.72 --> 1492.32
started out the opposite

1488.96 --> 1494.799
remember 2 p.m amsterdam time every day

1492.32 --> 1495.6789999999999
and then in the weekends i i do one and

1494.799 --> 1499.36
a half hour

1495.679 --> 1501.679
two hours longer now now i'm gonna turn

1499.36 --> 1505.4399999999998
it around

1501.679 --> 1509.8400000000001
two hours in the weekdays and one hour

1505.44 --> 1513.279
in the weekends one hour later

1509.84 --> 1516.1589999999999
that that's my new plan it's a very

1513.279 --> 1516.159
tiny change

1517.919 --> 1521.1200000000001
but i'm gonna try it out

1526.84 --> 1529.84
right

1536.32 --> 1543.279
right watching more south park

1540.32 --> 1543.279
into season 10

1543.679 --> 1548.159
was pretty freaky like going through

1546.159 --> 1552.64
like the

1548.159 --> 1556.0800000000002
uh like the mormon store backstory

1552.64 --> 1559.3600000000001
and the scientology and then the

1556.08 --> 1561.84
obvious blowback from that

1559.36 --> 1563.279
because with chef but it's fascinating

1561.84 --> 1567.039
to again watch that

1563.279 --> 1568.64
and see like how they basically were

1567.039 --> 1570.96
trolling him

1568.64 --> 1573.279
in that episode with the super adventure

1570.96 --> 1573.279
club

1573.76 --> 1578.08
and like they were really trolling in

1575.84 --> 1580.32
that one as a response and it

1578.08 --> 1580.32
like

1581.919 --> 1585.8400000000001
in a way pretty badass

1591.279 --> 1598.24
right side yeah south park

1594.32 --> 1601.52
is really an awesome series

1598.24 --> 1603.44
and other than that

1601.52 --> 1605.76
watching some lift the veil in the night

1603.44 --> 1605.76
again

1607.05 --> 1610.52
[Music]

1611.6 --> 1616.1589999999999
somewhere in between also watching alex

1613.679 --> 1616.159
jones

1618.72 --> 1622.48
but yeah nothing too much stood out the

1621.44 --> 1623.679
liftville was

1622.48 --> 1627.84
constantly talking about

1623.679 --> 1627.8400000000001
cryptocurrencies and all that

1638.84 --> 1641.84
right

1642.0 --> 1658.0
so and we're halfway the show until

1654.559 --> 1660.799
god yeah george sanford

1658.0 --> 1662.399
i've missed people also until i see one

1660.799 --> 1664.96
and then they open their pile and speak

1662.399 --> 1664.9599999999998
nonsense

1666.84 --> 1669.84
right

1677.44 --> 1683.6000000000001
hello krishna kumar

1680.559 --> 1686.32
george sanford

1683.6 --> 1697.84
what many claims truthers have turned

1686.32 --> 1697.84
into crypto pushers

1700.399 --> 1708.0
well what else are they gonna do

1704.72 --> 1708.0
in ways you know

1709.279 --> 1715.039
like in my own right i've been

1712.32 --> 1718.6399999999999
in one of those sort of things that have

1715.039 --> 1718.64
had kind of turned crypto

1718.799 --> 1723.12
but if also because of judicial

1721.76 --> 1728.32
situations not

1723.12 --> 1732.32
might but with it complications

1728.32 --> 1734.8799999999999
a lot of lawsuit situations or lawsuit

1732.32 --> 1736.08
like attempts with a huge pile of

1734.88 --> 1738.72
lawyers to basically

1736.08 --> 1741.1999999999998
stop them and declaring all kinds of

1738.72 --> 1741.2
nonsense

1743.36 --> 1750.6399999999999
and it so especially in the beginning

1746.88 --> 1753.8400000000001
it the company gti was not allowed

1750.64 --> 1758.0
to even have people

1753.84 --> 1758.0
talk about it on youtube that was real

1758.159 --> 1764.5590000000002
okay are you sure you want to say that

1765.679 --> 1768.72
is that the first thing you're gonna say

1767.44 --> 1771.1200000000001
after being on block

1768.72 --> 1771.1200000000001
really

1773.2 --> 1777.039
got some older trolls in here

1777.84 --> 1782.6399999999999
i'm just gonna leave it there so just

1784.08 --> 1788.8799999999999
i guess that's when you're a troll and

1787.039 --> 1789.679
you're unblocked that's the first thing

1788.88 --> 1795.8400000000001
you're gonna say

1789.679 --> 1795.8400000000001
makes sense right guys

1803.76 --> 1809.36
ah right okay okay big dream small pp i

every time if that is

1812.72 --> 1816.3990000000001
what you demand of me jab at the trolls

1815.919 --> 1819.6000000000001
but

1816.399 --> 1821.52
me being an actual show host interacting

1819.6 --> 1822.1589999999999
with chat that means that i will be

1821.52 --> 1824.24
literally

1822.159 --> 1825.279
saying that name now constantly thanks

1824.24 --> 1828.24
to you

1825.279 --> 1828.24
so thanks for that

1829.6 --> 1834.399
but i'm glad you're not a troll or at

1832.72 --> 1837.84
least you

1834.399 --> 1837.84
seem not to be

1838.72 --> 1844.3990000000001

1841.279 --> 1847.279
half full kind of guy

1844.399 --> 1848.7199999999998

1847.279 --> 1852.159
it's just half full

1848.72 --> 1856.559
half empty what

1852.159 --> 1859.7600000000002
it's both half empty and half full

1856.559 --> 1863.279
that's more the kind of a guy i am

1859.76 --> 1865.84
call me bd okay i could just call you

1863.279 --> 1865.84
big dreams

1866.559 --> 1871.9189999999999

1869.44 --> 1879.8400000000001
entire name

1871.919 --> 1879.8400000000001

so

1908.0 --> 1912.159
what's the circular spherical

1911.2 --> 1917.6000000000001
circumference

what size of letters what

1919.519 --> 1923.44
the location where they have that's a

1922.0 --> 1927.279
malformed question

1923.44 --> 1930.0800000000002
uh christian kumar

1927.279 --> 1931.12
sorry i can't help you with that it's a

1930.08 --> 1933.9189999999999
contradiction

1931.12 --> 1936.6399999999999
and then a reification of a location of

1933.919 --> 1936.64
information

1942.88 --> 1949.8400000000001
there is no underside there's only one

2018.96 --> 2024.32
the side

2020.0 --> 2026.96
necessarily the site will reveal itself

2024.32 --> 2029.12
one way or the other it has to it's

and you ain't got two screens have you

2364.72 --> 2368.9599999999996
screen capture yeah you'd have to do it

2367.28 --> 2369.6800000000003
as a screen capture on skype because you

2368.96 --> 2371.92
can't just pull

2369.68 --> 2373.2
skype now from the skype window you have

2371.92 --> 2374.96
to do it as a

2373.2 --> 2376.24
actual separate screen capture of the

2374.96 --> 2379.76
screen

2376.24 --> 2382.0789999999997
as opposed to taking the window oh my

2505.92 --> 2509.839
it also talks about impact craters about

2507.839 --> 2512.319
why craters are circles

2509.839 --> 2514.319
and not elongated it's brilliant there

2512.319 --> 2516.079
you go

2514.319 --> 2517.52

oh

2566.18 --> 2572.64
[Music]

2570.64 --> 2573.839
a picture of the moon any photograph of

2572.64 --> 2576.0789999999997
the moon shape of the crater

2573.839 --> 2577.44
they're perfect circles so here you go

2576.079 --> 2579.599
you ready

2577.44 --> 2580.8
if you if you have an impactor that

2579.599 --> 2583.2000000000003
comes in

2580.8 --> 2584.48
uh straight into a surface it makes a

2583.2 --> 2586.8799999999997
circular crater

2584.48 --> 2588.56
if you send it at an angle it will make

2586.88 --> 2591.52
an elongated crater

2588.56 --> 2593.2
okay this will happen so they're saying

2591.52 --> 2597.359
now wait a minute let's send it in

2593.2 --> 2601.2
faster turns out

2597.359 --> 2601.2
there is a magic speed

2602.8 --> 2608.96
with which you can send in an asteroid

2606.96 --> 2613.28
and on collision it will make a perfect

2608.96 --> 2613.28
circle no matter the angle it hits

2618.839 --> 2623.839
circle

2621.2 --> 2626.3999999999996
because lava in liquid state flattens

2623.839 --> 2626.4
out right

2626.47 --> 2634.24
[Music]

2631.599 --> 2649.839
because lava in liquid state flattens

out right

2655.44 --> 2657.92
all right

2660.4 --> 2666.4

chocolate's new rap flutter crap

definition at the moment

2703.119 --> 2707.599
uh it doesn't matter it's like it's

2705.28 --> 2709.28
gonna eventually reveal itself very low

2707.599 --> 2710.7200000000003
resolution here

2709.28 --> 2712.88
it probably will because it's only

2710.72 --> 2716.16
literally only just gone up

2712.88 --> 2719.359
the tune should be all right right

2716.16 --> 2722.319

2755.839 --> 2758.839
not spinning

2756.56 --> 2760.0789999999997
what is the world what and now we know

2758.839 --> 2762.0
is

2760.079 --> 2763.52
missing what is the world what is the

2762.0 --> 2764.16
world that we're living in now we know

2763.52 --> 2766.0
flowers

2764.16 --> 2767.5989999999997
winning what is the world what is the

2766.0 --> 2768.56
world that we're living it's like a

2767.599 --> 2769.92
brand new beginning

2768.56 --> 2771.68
we know that most of you are sitting

2769.92 --> 2773.599
there wishing probably just itching for

2771.68 --> 2774.96
us to go away completely dismissing

2773.599 --> 2776.56
things that we say like our minds have

2774.96 --> 2777.599
gone missing meanwhile you're really the

2776.56 --> 2779.839
only one shifting

2777.599 --> 2781.52
reality as if it was switching like it

2779.839 --> 2783.119
was some type of fantasy pitching

2781.52 --> 2784.72
next something bad but you wind up just

2783.119 --> 2785.599
whiffing nothing but air you just can't

2784.72 --> 2787.04
do no hitting

2785.599 --> 2788.96
running around saying that water

2787.04 --> 2789.599
sticking to outside the balls your logic

2788.96 --> 2791.119
is slipping

2789.599 --> 2792.96
i understand that you might think i'm

2791.119 --> 2793.599
tripping pay attention to the words that

2792.96 --> 2795.44
i'm spitting

2793.599 --> 2796.88
only thing that really needs any fixing

2795.44 --> 2798.56
your view of the world and the way that

2796.88 --> 2800.4
you're thinking no need to go always

2798.56 --> 2802.0
screaming and kicking no reason to think

2800.4 --> 2803.76
that earth might be tricking if it was

2802.0 --> 2805.599
spinning then we would see drifting if

2803.76 --> 2807.599
it was curving the ship to be sinking

2805.599 --> 2809.52
logical fallacy keep on insisting

2807.599 --> 2810.8
poppy just listen how about you try this

2809.52 --> 2812.8
and fall now because these conditions

2810.8 --> 2814.079
disappear due to angular distance makes

2812.8 --> 2815.92
a lot more sense that the curve's not

2814.079 --> 2818.0
existence why the persistence why the

2815.92 --> 2819.839
pursuit of unlimited resistance fighting

2818.0 --> 2821.52
a war like a soldier enlisted really

2819.839 --> 2824.4
seems as though you got it all twisted

2821.52 --> 2826.16
why not just be a bit more optimistic

2824.4 --> 2827.92
the fail has been lifted now you've been

2826.16 --> 2829.7599999999998
gifted given permission to take a

2827.92 --> 2830.56
position not in opposition to the world

2829.76 --> 2832.7200000000003
that we're living

2830.56 --> 2834.48
create ignition start of the engine true

2832.72 --> 2835.04
state accepted now this is your mission

2834.48 --> 2836.88
tell us

2835.04 --> 2838.48
why the damn curvature's missing maybe

2836.88 --> 2840.1600000000003
just call up a mathematician

2838.48 --> 2841.52
give him a listen have him tell you

2840.16 --> 2844.0789999999997
about his presuppositions

2841.52 --> 2844.88
talking about how it's not a vacuum and

2844.079 --> 2847.04
air pressure just

2844.88 --> 2848.559
a position make a decision tell us how

2847.04 --> 2849.92
this model came to fruition

2848.559 --> 2851.76
you have the right to enact your

2849.92 --> 2852.559
volition right up to the day of mental

2851.76 --> 2854.559
acquisition

2852.559 --> 2856.0
all i could do is provide ammunition you

2854.559 --> 2856.48
can't take the east day to [ __ ] out the

2856.0 --> 2858.559
kitchen

2856.48 --> 2860.0
judgment they go to the last demolition

2858.559 --> 2862.0
you can see this is an act of

2860.0 --> 2863.839
attrition on the condition that after

2862.0 --> 2864.48
admission do you a favor and start the

2863.839 --> 2866.0
forgiving

2864.48 --> 2867.44
then go out and share your newfound

2866.0 --> 2868.559
position with everybody who's

2867.44 --> 2870.48
potentially victim

2868.559 --> 2872.48
falling for the global prisoner system

2870.48 --> 2874.319
so many flaws the woman can list them

2872.48 --> 2875.92
shout to my beautiful parents i miss

2874.319 --> 2877.68
them taught me to think for myself i

2875.92 --> 2881.61
could kiss them now to the day that i'm

2877.68 --> 2886.79
able to whisk them away in my arms

2881.61 --> 2886.79
[Music]

2898.839 --> 2901.839
wow

2902.24 --> 2909.52
yeah that's badass although

2905.92 --> 2911.76
god it was very flashy

2909.52 --> 2913.44
yeah there's a lot of the graphics

2911.76 --> 2916.0
haven't rendered to all the

2913.44 --> 2918.16
i did that for you illuminati eyes in

2916.0 --> 2919.04
there oh when there's an illuminati eye

2918.16 --> 2921.52
in that pyramid

2919.04 --> 2922.4
that's a ball as well so when it renders

2921.52 --> 2925.68
better you'll see

2922.4 --> 2927.359
that for me did you thank you i was

2925.68 --> 2929.52
trying to think yeah i'm thinking i

2927.359 --> 2930.72
love that when i saw that graphic image

2929.52 --> 2932.88
i thought i'm having that

2930.72 --> 2936.48
illuminati eye it went in the shape of a

2932.88 --> 2936.48
croissant but it's close enough bro

2938.079 --> 2946.1600000000003
yeah but it's an impressive clip

2942.559 --> 2948.1600000000003
but like there is like a constant static

2946.16 --> 2951.04
thing going on

2948.16 --> 2952.0
and like at some point i kind of had to

2951.04 --> 2954.079
take a distance

2952.0 --> 2956.16
make sure that the amount of screen that

2954.079 --> 2958.559
was filling up in my view

2956.16 --> 2959.52
was little because it was like yeah

2958.559 --> 2963.2000000000003
getting me

2959.52 --> 2964.24
weirded out a little i nearly brought a

2963.2 --> 2968.5589999999997
seizure on

2964.24 --> 2970.72
yeah sort of if that is what it's called

2968.559 --> 2972.2400000000002
right i turned that down i had it on

2970.72 --> 2974.0
full strobe effect before

2972.24 --> 2976.4799999999996
yeah it was making me feel nauseous when

2974.0 --> 2978.559
i was editing it

2976.48 --> 2981.2
right so you might want to use that

2978.559 --> 2982.6400000000003
sparingly like in a certain situation to

2981.2 --> 2985.04
emphasize something or

2982.64 --> 2987.52
give it as an effect but if it's

2985.04 --> 2990.48
constantly there it's like

2987.52 --> 2993.7599999999998
what it's the trigger ballers it'll

2990.48 --> 2993.76
trigger their minds if actually

2994.319 --> 2998.16
it was weird because i was watching

2996.88 --> 3000.079
jiren

2998.16 --> 3002.24
oh yeah i even forgot to make that note

3000.079 --> 3002.559
but i did watch jaren who was going live

3002.24 --> 3004.5589999999997
too

3002.559 --> 3005.92
yesterday and he was also playing

3004.559 --> 3009.28
something

3005.92 --> 3010.96
and it for some reason the same effect

3009.28 --> 3013.2000000000003
something similar was used just this

3010.96 --> 3015.52
constant staticky thing throughout

3013.2 --> 3016.96
a whole video and it too was giving me a

3015.52 --> 3017.92
headache i'm just wondering like what

3016.96 --> 3020.7200000000003
what is this is

3017.92 --> 3021.359
the new thing why is everybody ah and

3020.72 --> 3023.4399999999996
now this

3021.359 --> 3024.72
clip is static too like what is this

3023.44 --> 3027.599
static

3024.72 --> 3030.0789999999997
is this the new thing it's getting

3027.599 --> 3030.079
hotness

3032.559 --> 3039.28
so it's cool today anyway

3035.839 --> 3041.7599999999998
was it a lazy lady this

3039.28 --> 3043.3590000000004
yeah morning bit well sort of for me i

3041.76 --> 3045.599
didn't even go to bed that late it's

3043.359 --> 3048.0
just that

3045.599 --> 3048.7200000000003
i know i texted you about midnight one

3048.0 --> 3051.28
o'clock

3048.72 --> 3051.7599999999998
and you were you know you weren't even

3051.28 --> 3056.0
on

3051.76 --> 3058.1600000000003
your scalp weren't even on yeah

3056.0 --> 3060.0
i don't know why that was i think that

3058.16 --> 3062.96
uh

3060.0 --> 3065.119
i reset my computer at some point and

3062.96 --> 3068.48
yeah that was it i reset my computer and

3065.119 --> 3070.88
i kind of forgot to open skype

3068.48 --> 3073.92
usually in in the evening i'm not very

3070.88 --> 3076.4
communicative anyway

3073.92 --> 3077.28
like later in the evening after 10

3076.4 --> 3082.0
o'clock

3077.28 --> 3083.52
my time

3082.0 --> 3085.2
well i was busy i only wanted you to go

3083.52 --> 3086.8
through that just just to proofread it

3085.2 --> 3089.68
for me

3086.8 --> 3091.52
sorry i wanted you just to go and watch

3089.68 --> 3094.0
that for us proof read it because

3091.52 --> 3095.359
no it was cool man i had to do a load of

3094.0 --> 3098.319
spelling mistakes this morning

3095.359 --> 3098.319
what spelling mistake

3099.04 --> 3102.319
what do you mean spelling mistakes yeah

3101.119 --> 3105.359
well i've put

3102.319 --> 3106.64
chocolate wanted all the the the actual

3105.359 --> 3110.88
lyrics along the bottom

3106.64 --> 3113.2
all right oh so his

3110.88 --> 3114.0
lyrics had a lot of spelling mistakes no

3113.2 --> 3117.68
i i

3114.0 --> 3118.72
did oh okay as it's getting late when

3117.68 --> 3123.839
you type it

3118.72 --> 3126.64
um oh andy had something to be fair

3123.839 --> 3127.52
yeah so he you never got like the

3126.64 --> 3129.5989999999997
original

3127.52 --> 3131.68
text or he just did it all by yeah i've

3129.599 --> 3135.2000000000003
got it but when you try and

3131.68 --> 3135.2
do insta you know when it's late at

3136.839 --> 3141.119
night

3138.64 --> 3141.7599999999998
so it's still a project still you're

3141.119 --> 3144.7200000000003
still

3141.76 --> 3145.2000000000003
in the polishing phase that'll clean up

3144.72 --> 3147.2799999999997
now

3145.2 --> 3148.8799999999997
that'll render up nice and should look

3147.28 --> 3152.48
better in an hour or two

3148.88 --> 3154.88
once it's up properly in um

3152.48 --> 3156.559
i think that's about virtually done

3154.88 --> 3159.2000000000003
pretty cool yes there's any constructive

3156.559 --> 3161.8390000000004
input we get we might tweak it but

3159.2 --> 3164.64
right i really liked it except that yeah

3161.839 --> 3167.2799999999997
again the constant staticky effect it

3164.64 --> 3168.16
and the flashiness it did give me a bit

3167.28 --> 3171.3590000000004
of a

3168.16 --> 3172.319
seizure effect so personally i try to

3171.359 --> 3174.0
avoid that i

3172.319 --> 3177.599
might be a whole range of people that

3174.0 --> 3180.96
are just completely unbothered by that

3177.599 --> 3183.28
but that was the only yeah what is it

3180.96 --> 3185.359
the point of worry or what do you call

3183.28 --> 3189.3590000000004
that

3185.359 --> 3190.96
the only note i wanted to put there

3189.359 --> 3192.5589999999997
and all the arrests was pretty cool and

3190.96 --> 3194.8
i've heard this song before

3192.559 --> 3196.559
it's very impressive and it's funny

3194.8 --> 3198.319
because i even heard

3196.559 --> 3200.48
just sitting in the back panel of the

3198.319 --> 3204.5589999999997
flat earth debate

3200.48 --> 3207.44
unrecorded was it you

3204.559 --> 3208.4
fooling around with that somebody else

3207.44 --> 3210.4
and then

3208.4 --> 3212.079
like the lyrics were mismatched with the

3210.4 --> 3213.6800000000003
music at some point because it was

3212.079 --> 3214.96
getting all stretched up there was all

3213.68 --> 3217.68
kinds of stuff being done but it's

3214.96 --> 3223.2
really good to hear it in a good

3217.68 --> 3225.68
final format like this pretty awesome

3223.2 --> 3225.68
this song

3226.48 --> 3231.52
cool yeah thanks for sharing man and

3266.96 --> 3271.599
on the record pretty much built this

3270.079 --> 3274.319
layout

3271.599 --> 3274.319
for my show

3274.64 --> 3278.24
i just put it together from stuff on the

3277.44 --> 3293.839
internet

no i'm not blocking anybody i'm not

3363.2 --> 3366.5589999999997
playing this game anymore

3368.079 --> 3377.8390000000004
they're just gonna have to make a point

3370.079 --> 3377.8390000000004
or be made to shut the [ __ ] up

3385.839 --> 3393.52
okay rufus and tubbins fine

3390.4 --> 3393.52
but nobody's blood
