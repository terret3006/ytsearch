7.17 --> 38.47
[Music]

39.47 --> 46.92
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

43.41 --> 48.69
early-bird number 204 I'm your host

46.92 --> 51.300000000000004
Arwen and before we start the show

48.69 --> 55.5
please don't forget to share this on any

51.3 --> 57.48
platform you deem fit and also if you

55.5 --> 58.65
haven't already please please subscribe

57.48 --> 60.239
to my channel and hit the bell

58.65 --> 61.83
notification so you know when I'm going

60.239 --> 65.6
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

61.83 --> 70.77
Amsterdam time so today the weather is

65.6 --> 75.149
kind of the same as yesterday warm but

70.77 --> 80.759
cloudy it's a lot more cloudy and I've

75.149 --> 87.84
seen chemtrails this morning so I don't

80.759 --> 92.7
know it's still nice but yeah and it's

87.84 --> 99.24000000000001
been cooking here all morning so how you

92.7 --> 104.369
guys all doing let's see see Eagle plane

99.24 --> 107.25
and Anchor AGM page Cleary James Mason

104.369 --> 111.619
Oprah Mukul good to see you guys yeah I

107.25 --> 115.44
still got a bit of a cold although it's

111.619 --> 120.09
it's like different now like it's dried

115.44 --> 123.33
up but much of much of the issue seems

120.09 --> 127.649
to have migrated down here but not

123.33 --> 130.8
painfully so but yeah I think our we

127.649 --> 134.459
probably yeah if this continues this

130.8 --> 139.08
cycle I hope I don't get like a certain

134.459 --> 143.18
phase but it's definitely going to be

139.08 --> 143.18
gone in like four days I'm sure that

143.78 --> 154.41
we'll see a bit of a headache right

151.02 --> 157.26000000000002
before this weird but it's only like

154.41 --> 159.51
glances sometimes like some like the

157.26 --> 161.54999999999998
weird feeling like something's like not

159.51 --> 165.14999999999998
in the right place almost like a muscle

161.55 --> 168.44
is getting in the way but it well maybe

165.15 --> 172.11
that is what it is maybe it is like a a

168.44 --> 174.42
muscle cramp near the skull and it just

172.11 --> 179.16000000000003
radiates through or something I don't

174.42 --> 182.35999999999999
know what that is but yeah that's just

179.16 --> 186.69
normal at that kind of thing all my life

182.36 --> 189.45000000000002
it's now really that bad even yeah so

186.69 --> 193.98
yeah today I got tumeric coffee already

189.45 --> 199.38
enjoying that I got an apple again and I

193.98 --> 203.33999999999997
got some tea and that's it hello pumpkin

199.38 --> 210.29999999999998
puffs Johnson good to see you Parish

203.34 --> 214.44
Mike am i UK yeah we yesterday like

210.3 --> 219.54000000000002
after the debates stopped we had like a

214.44 --> 221.73
huge conversation afterwards like past 6

219.54 --> 226.34
o'clock for me so that went on for like

221.73 --> 226.34
3 hours or something was intense

228.66 --> 238.60999999999999
Hey what is it why are you looking so

235.61 --> 238.61
sad

240.08 --> 243.08
Jessica

255.17 --> 263.03
you left the server Oh

258.59 --> 267.71
discord right well done finally it's

263.03 --> 272.03
never too late to leave this Court good

267.71 --> 273.85999999999996
on you yeah look it's one of the few

272.03 --> 276.28999999999996
things that I didn't have to learn the

273.86 --> 278.87
hard way because I just knew it like

276.29 --> 281.36
right away like this is trouble just

278.87 --> 283.37
like with IPS like the instant he came

281.36 --> 286.0
on it was like oh my god this is like a

283.37 --> 286.0
total

286.27 --> 298.84999999999997
Savan yay he is the definition of a

290.87 --> 301.37
Chevalier like absolutely he is so and

298.85 --> 311.90000000000003
this court's full of that [ __ ] and

301.37 --> 315.08
horrifying trolls and perverts yeah so

311.9 --> 319.37
fine it's a it's like a folklore thing

315.08 --> 323.51
that when Benjamin brought up and I

319.37 --> 326.78000000000003
really it's like yeah I used to do

323.51 --> 328.729
exactly that kind of [ __ ] like make up

326.78 --> 332.09
stereotyped characters that are just

328.729 --> 335.45
freaking hilarious based on on the real

332.09 --> 339.02
life types that's what I you like used

335.45 --> 344.33
to do between when I was six

339.02 --> 347.06
up until like in my 16 because I was

344.33 --> 352.15
just I had so much fun with doing that

347.06 --> 354.919
and always being naughty yeah I love it

352.15 --> 358.27
but I totally get this so Vanya it's

354.919 --> 358.27
really a thing of this age

361.0 --> 364.31
[Music]

365.9 --> 371.62
it's like passive aggressive ski me

373.03 --> 376.03
skinny

376.21 --> 383.69
sorry boy like not necessarily sorry boy

379.82 --> 385.19
but so boy like small guys I hope I

383.69 --> 389.57
don't classify them I got broad

385.19 --> 397.71999999999997
shoulders and I'm not that skinny anyway

389.57 --> 401.75
but yeah IPS and Eric Dubay it's just

397.72 --> 404.42
like yeah they have skill and I would

401.75 --> 407.6
definitely give it that to them like hey

404.42 --> 411.32
I know skill when I see it it's just how

407.6 --> 413.3
they apply it and what they seem to be

411.32 --> 419.0
comfortable with with dealing with

413.3 --> 421.01
people and yeah really like narrative

419.0 --> 426.65
building like making their owns private

421.01 --> 428.93
media empire type thing that's yeah and

426.65 --> 432.58
people start falling in line like online

428.93 --> 432.58
soldiers it's crazy

435.1 --> 441.139
Savan yay

437.719 --> 444.199
mmm but yeah I I never went to discord I

441.139 --> 447.829
I never went to Facebook like I even had

444.199 --> 450.949
issues like with my ex over Facebook

447.829 --> 454.459
because she had friends on Facebook but

450.949 --> 455.629
yeah I was very much like deep in Alex

454.459 --> 457.009
Jones at that time

455.629 --> 458.689
and she knew it and she kind of

457.009 --> 461.449
respected it even though she didn't like

458.689 --> 461.899
listening to the guy the information was

461.449 --> 464.479
good

461.899 --> 472.099
basically when I translated it in my

464.479 --> 474.949
fashion making audible for her and she

472.099 --> 477.319
like okay I'll just make a profile so I

474.949 --> 482.119
could leave at least watch and then

477.319 --> 486.589
maybe email them it was really sweet in

482.119 --> 488.17900000000003
retrospect and yeah because I really

486.589 --> 490.009
said like no you don't want to do that

488.179 --> 491.86899999999997
like everything you put on Facebook it's

490.009 --> 496.749
like can be held against you in some

491.869 --> 501.199
freaky way eventually it's don't do it

496.749 --> 504.529
and she didn't I think she probably does

501.199 --> 508.189
now I don't know I get the feeling that

504.529 --> 511.129
she's kind of like yeah surrendered

508.189 --> 514.279
basically when realizing how big it all

511.129 --> 516.439
became and it kind of flat earth made

514.279 --> 518.449
her realize like this is too big for me

516.439 --> 518.899
and what I really want to do with my

518.449 --> 529.699
life

518.899 --> 533.99
it's it's brutal yeah but yeah she did

529.699 --> 536.269
respect that and I still did like I

533.99 --> 540.649
don't like Facebook I I'm glad you can

536.269 --> 544.639
now sometimes at least watch like how

540.649 --> 547.339
was it post for embedded post book

544.639 --> 551.389
things so it at least is something it's

547.339 --> 553.4590000000001
just a platform really but yeah I'm not

551.389 --> 555.92
gonna make a profile for Facebook and

553.459 --> 557.319
I'm definitely not going on this court

555.92 --> 561.2299999999999
like I tried it once

557.319 --> 563.18
it felt all terrible it was you know I

561.23 --> 565.899
was in the time when I still basically

563.18 --> 565.899
trusted

566.66 --> 571.889
Antonio su barrettes who was kind of the

570.3 --> 574.9799999999999
one that tried to draw me in with

571.889 --> 576.839
everybody else and I don't know what

574.98 --> 579.87
happened but my computer was all screwed

576.839 --> 582.48
up I'm not blaming him for it but it's

579.87 --> 586.889
just it was all wrong

582.48 --> 588.899
I had to reinstall my computer after

586.889 --> 596.1
that so

588.899 --> 600.42
no not trying that again yeah anyway

596.1 --> 605.009
yeah I went off in a tangent there or

600.42 --> 607.649
whatever you I think I may be losing a

605.009 --> 611.67
little bit of my my accuracy on my

607.649 --> 614.37
gripping of words sometimes I don't know

611.67 --> 617.389
why it is maybe that is kind of because

614.37 --> 617.389
of I have a cold

621.69 --> 625.5600000000001
I don't know maybe I do get it right but

623.97 --> 627.87
just feels like sometimes my work

625.56 --> 642.8699999999999
choices seem a little bit off compared

627.87 --> 646.79
to usual tamerica feels good okay let's

642.87 --> 649.38
get back into some subject ah

646.79 --> 654.39
I was watching Owen Benjamin right

649.38 --> 658.14
before this was just being pretty pretty

654.39 --> 662.27
straightforward like he's always doing

658.14 --> 664.71
that but like even more than usual like

662.27 --> 666.54
even saying like yeah I say this all the

664.71 --> 669.48
time like almost like a joke but it's

666.54 --> 674.52
actually real and yeah

669.48 --> 676.82
heavy stuff so what else happened let me

674.52 --> 676.8199999999999
check

682.63 --> 685.259
what

689.39 --> 694.399
oh yeah slip'n worry yesterday yeah

691.55 --> 699.41
yesterday's show was awesome I was right

694.399 --> 703.49
he was really eager to he was a like all

699.41 --> 705.62
in in a flow a lot of energy but he was

703.49 --> 708.2
also distracted a lot so he was doing a

705.62 --> 710.0600000000001
lot of things at the same time it's

708.2 --> 713.69
clearly hyperactive but it was good to

710.06 --> 717.6099999999999
have him on even though he kind of tried

713.69 --> 717.61
to take over the show at some points but

718.72 --> 731.589
it's good hey chocolate its McLeod

733.29 --> 743.36
bill G and we got a global page if only

741.15 --> 743.36
one

754.45 --> 759.61
god betaf only with it's so obvious if

757.36 --> 762.1
you're really I up you're still gonna be

759.61 --> 767.74
limited in how far you can see due to

762.1 --> 773.13
lack of air clarity that's still gonna

767.74 --> 778.17
be applied so if you're above everything

773.13 --> 778.17
then at some point it'll just be cut off

778.199 --> 784.29
because yeah there's a lot of air and

781.48 --> 784.29
stuff in the way

790.56 --> 795.8699999999999
like there's the the weird consume and

794.249 --> 799.139
effect you know when you look out for a

795.87 --> 801.72
flat plane or basically anything buddy

799.139 --> 805.019
including over a flat plane or something

801.72 --> 808.0790000000001
flat and then there's also the general

805.019 --> 810.149
effect that the the wider the distance

808.079 --> 812.3889999999999
all those gases and whatever is

810.149 --> 817.339
dissolved in those gases and water

812.389 --> 821.759
anything all that is gonna also well

817.339 --> 825.389
diffuse the light blur it up eventually

821.759 --> 829.37
if enough is that refracted yeah

825.389 --> 831.8
probably but in in a not in direct

829.37 --> 835.35
deviation of the light but rather just

831.8 --> 837.3
diffusing it and that's why eventually

835.35 --> 840.499
just you can't see any further because

837.3 --> 845.49
there's just too much air in between

840.499 --> 848.8190000000001
blurring it up and in a very clear day

845.49 --> 853.11
you can see extremely far and that that

848.819 --> 856.67
blur limit as it were can be much

853.11 --> 860.75
farther than on a kind of a misty day or

856.67 --> 864.42
just where it's kind of warm and moist

860.75 --> 866.009
so yeah that's there's two factors you

864.42 --> 871.2299999999999
know what I even have a picture of it

866.009 --> 874.25
let's see if I can share that it's a

871.23 --> 874.25
very early picture

875.04 --> 879.5999999999999
still based on the uptick come on

882.9 --> 888.84
you'll diagram based on the optical

886.2 --> 894.48
slant let's see

888.84 --> 900.0300000000001
I used to present this a very different

894.48 --> 903.71
way yeah through Google Hangouts but now

900.03 --> 906.27
how do I do this wait I can drop it and

903.71 --> 909.2900000000001
Skype and then present it through that

906.27 --> 909.29
yeah I'm going to do that

912.42 --> 926.41
all right yes that's the way to do it

919.83 --> 928.36
right so there you go so let's see if

926.41 --> 932.14
you look right here you got the observer

928.36 --> 934.72
the I floating eye then you got

932.14 --> 936.87
everything near to you which takes up

934.72 --> 941.86
your entire view the view narrows down

936.87 --> 944.98
as I said it narrows down and then folds

941.86 --> 946.51
into the horizon falls into it and

944.98 --> 950.1
everything there you get the optical

946.51 --> 952.96
slant effect everything you get a linear

950.1 --> 959.2
abstraction rate after that point hold

952.96 --> 962.11
on let's see if I yeah and then at the

959.2 --> 966.4300000000001
end you get the obstruction from lack of

962.11 --> 968.6800000000001
air clarity so yeah the optical slant

966.43 --> 970.81
effect is basically not obstruction it's

968.68 --> 973.68
rather concealment it's apparent

970.81 --> 976.4799999999999
obstruction should correct that right

973.68 --> 979.2399999999999
and it's still called that area beyond

976.48 --> 981.85
that the circle of confusion but that's

979.24 --> 986.89
an early terminology it is basically the

981.85 --> 990.28
Mirage in zone let's see yeah mirages in

986.89 --> 992.53
or distortion zone it's funny like how

990.28 --> 996.88
much all these terminologies have

992.53 --> 1003.6899999999999
shifted but yeah this still it really

996.88 --> 1007.71
explains how things work so but not

1003.69 --> 1011.6
using the the true physics of optics

1007.71 --> 1014.5500000000001
terminology this is all yeah more

1011.6 --> 1016.82
intuitive like how it presents itself to

1014.55 --> 1016.8199999999999
you

1021.65 --> 1030.07
anyway yeah I hope that helps lighten a

1026.63 --> 1030.0700000000002
couple of aspects

1034.61 --> 1040.089
all right so yeah I am open for guests

1037.549 --> 1040.089
by the way

1050.81 --> 1053.94
[Music]

1057.26 --> 1066.09
gleen yay could reconsider reconsider

1062.61 --> 1067.7099999999998
that it must be the earth electrostatic

1066.09 --> 1070.1999999999998
field is that it is that what you're

1067.71 --> 1073.05
trying to do because that sounds kind of

1070.2 --> 1078.27
manipulative you know I'm not saying

1073.05 --> 1082.4099999999999
that it could not be in some way but to

1078.27 --> 1085.29
then say it must be that no I just go

1082.41 --> 1090.3600000000001
with the data and the data tells me that

1085.29 --> 1093.09
gravity as we have learned it is an

1090.36 --> 1096.2099999999998
aberration based on an apparent force

1093.09 --> 1099.84
this equilibrium or originally and then

1096.21 --> 1104.07
all kinds of stuff and nonsense ethereal

1099.84 --> 1106.9499999999998
and yeah extra realm Ian like outer

1104.07 --> 1113.46
space all that [ __ ] was all grafted on

1106.95 --> 1116.3700000000001
it so that is my view of gravity that is

1113.46 --> 1118.8
the gravity we know and yeah we have no

1116.37 --> 1121.26
source as to determine really what

1118.8 --> 1123.84
causes this apparent forcing this

1121.26 --> 1126.69
equilibrium until we are able to vary it

1123.84 --> 1130.32
and hey if this electrostatic field

1126.69 --> 1132.72
thing is really the cause of it then

1130.32 --> 1135.27
well you should find a way to actually

1132.72 --> 1138.54
isolate it and then see if it really

1135.27 --> 1142.08
does create a apparent zero-g

1138.54 --> 1147.12
environment for example just on the

1142.08 --> 1149.6899999999998
earth and and not with fields like yeah

1147.12 --> 1152.01
you could definitely have like magnets

1149.69 --> 1154.1100000000001
basically opposing one another and then

1152.01 --> 1156.33
keep something in between not that kind

1154.11 --> 1159.24
of stuff like really a zero-g

1156.33 --> 1163.1699999999998
environment where things just free float

1159.24 --> 1166.91
totally and abated by any kind of

1163.17 --> 1166.91
apparent directional force

1173.15 --> 1179.27
so yeah I am very much you could say

1176.93 --> 1182.8700000000001
scientifically interested in all this

1179.27 --> 1186.32
and I do see the options but you can't

1182.87 --> 1188.84
just say it must be this because it's

1186.32 --> 1191.23
the only thing that kind of comes close

1188.84 --> 1194.27
to what it could be

1191.23 --> 1196.34
because that's the same [ __ ] that the

1194.27 --> 1199.15
gravity believers are doing it's like

1196.34 --> 1202.6999999999998
yeah but it must be there because look

1199.15 --> 1205.19
all the signs all the phenomena all this

1202.7 --> 1207.6200000000001
things are pointing that there must be a

1205.19 --> 1210.02
forces equilibrium present at least and

1207.62 --> 1211.4899999999998
we know the cost it's mass attracted by

1210.02 --> 1218.21
mass bla bla bla bla

1211.49 --> 1221.33
right so they're going off in it must be

1218.21 --> 1227.29
because it looks like it right so don't

1221.33 --> 1230.6899999999998
do the same thing think in possibilities

1227.29 --> 1234.559
things that you actually need to confirm

1230.69 --> 1236.3
in order to make it real but still these

1234.559 --> 1239.78
possibilities are there just like I

1236.3 --> 1242.57
treat Flat Earth or the the cosmogony

1239.78 --> 1245.8899999999999
the almost flat earth whatever it could

1242.57 --> 1245.8899999999999
turn out to be exactly

1263.41 --> 1269.8000000000002
yeah that's that's a really nice

1267.33 --> 1273.34
presuppositional structure of reasoning

1269.8 --> 1278.35
there gleam you know it sounds so solid

1273.34 --> 1281.86
it's almost like math but yeah yeah you

1278.35 --> 1283.3899999999999
kind of need to have some confirmations

1281.86 --> 1288.37
here in the physical in order to

1283.39 --> 1291.2800000000002
actually be so blatant that this must be

1288.37 --> 1297.04
it because that's exactly what globe

1291.28 --> 1300.1299999999999
gravity believers do or I guess people

1297.04 --> 1301.93
like Bob it wouldn't even be like

1300.13 --> 1304.72
objecting to me saying that like that

1301.93 --> 1306.79
but he basically says no because it all

1304.72 --> 1311.82
the signs pointed it there must be

1306.79 --> 1316.45
something there that's the same thing

1311.82 --> 1322.36
it's believing it looks like it but the

1316.45 --> 1324.16
thing apparent things don't cut wood or

1322.36 --> 1327.87
whatever it just supposed to say I don't

1324.16 --> 1330.01
it doesn't cut anything it has to be

1327.87 --> 1333.6399999999999
manipulated it has to be physically

1330.01 --> 1335.47
interacted with somehow and then then

1333.64 --> 1339.3400000000001
you got solid ground then you got a

1335.47 --> 1343.27
foundation for science so that's just it

1339.34 --> 1349.1999999999998
sorry Glover's and sorry flat earthers

1343.27 --> 1354.21
you can't like

1349.2 --> 1360.24
you can't make God reveal the final

1354.21 --> 1362.16
answers by jumping ahead you can look

1360.24 --> 1364.68
ahead but you can't then just say it

1362.16 --> 1366.6000000000001
must be this it's that's stupid that's

1364.68 --> 1370.17
what teenagers do that's what I used to

1366.6 --> 1376.9199999999998
do it's always wrong there's always more

1370.17 --> 1378.8100000000002
to it you can't jump to conclusions just

1376.92 --> 1382.22
gonna make you look foolish it's gonna

1378.81 --> 1385.53
make you look human but foolish you know

1382.22 --> 1388.47
being humans consolidation price in this

1385.53 --> 1390.48
in these matters it is because there is

1388.47 --> 1392.22
people at that there aren't because you

1390.48 --> 1394.74
can be human about it or you can just

1392.22 --> 1396.72
say no that's not what I said even

1394.74 --> 1399.66
though you just said that like ten

1396.72 --> 1408.06
seconds ago you know who I'm talking

1399.66 --> 1411.78
about Brenda Arsen but yeah if you want

1408.06 --> 1415.44
to get it right then you don't jump to

1411.78 --> 1419.49
conclusions and you get very careful how

1415.44 --> 1422.91
you express your ideas what's the angle

1419.49 --> 1426.86
what's a certainty level what is that

1422.91 --> 1430.8000000000002
based on and then how may you define it

1426.86 --> 1432.6299999999999
you know these layers of how you address

1430.8 --> 1436.02
it it's really it turned out to be

1432.63 --> 1438.3000000000002
really important it's almost become a

1436.02 --> 1440.67
little judicial in that way and that

1438.3 --> 1443.8799999999999
kind of put me off at first but now I

1440.67 --> 1446.39
see the sense of it it's really

1443.88 --> 1446.39
important

1451.72 --> 1461.269
the sky I don't know I think the sky

1459.35 --> 1463.9089999999999
doesn't really have a color I don't know

1461.269 --> 1468.11
what causes the blue we see in the

1463.909 --> 1470.8990000000001
backdrop during the day but I don't

1468.11 --> 1477.26
think it is the sky itself I don't think

1470.899 --> 1480.7399999999998
sky is blue it's not like Oh for super

1477.26 --> 1483.86
fast distances if you'd had like big

1480.74 --> 1487.09
white buildings opposing one I would say

1483.86 --> 1489.559
like a mile high like insane scale and

1487.09 --> 1491.269
like hundreds of miles in between you

1489.559 --> 1494.059
look between I don't think you would see

1491.269 --> 1496.99
that building bluish you know I think

1494.059 --> 1499.01
that air is actually pretty damn literal

1496.99 --> 1503.389
transparent on average it might be a

1499.01 --> 1506.21
little bit dusted up or gassed up with

1503.389 --> 1509.4799999999998
slightly coloring stuff like you know at

1506.21 --> 1512.48
the horizon when the sun goes down fumes

1509.48 --> 1514.49
and factory smoke and all that yeah that

1512.48 --> 1518.8990000000001
may definitely color things but the

1514.49 --> 1520.279
average gas mixture when all the dust

1518.899 --> 1522.559
and everything has said although the

1520.279 --> 1524.21
real lights altering particles have

1522.559 --> 1528.86
settled I don't think it really has a

1524.21 --> 1531.799
color so I don't think the sky the

1528.86 --> 1534.62
literal air is blue it's just we see

1531.799 --> 1537.889
blue and how that is manifested I don't

1534.62 --> 1540.7099999999998
exactly understand it's not literally

1537.889 --> 1543.83
the color of the air that we see so

1540.71 --> 1548.0900000000001
that's way too elaborate an answer but

1543.83 --> 1554.4089999999999
yeah sometimes they give answers to

1548.09 --> 1554.4089999999999
question you never knew you could ask so

1555.8 --> 1564.84
water is above oh yeah sure sure it is

1560.54 --> 1567.48
you know how blue is water have you ever

1564.84 --> 1570.6299999999999
seen really really deep oceans you know

1567.48 --> 1575.79
what they look like green they look at

1570.63 --> 1580.7900000000002
green parent they're not blue although

1575.79 --> 1587.7
that is also due to the salt I guess

1580.79 --> 1592.8
really clear water it kind of does look

1587.7 --> 1594.96
blue yeah yes that's right like

1592.8 --> 1597.6599999999999
especially like tropical waters a [ __ ]

1594.96 --> 1599.73
yeah blue it does really look blue and

1597.66 --> 1604.0500000000002
then there's more salt to it apparently

1599.73 --> 1606.18
it goes looking kind of green so at

1604.05 --> 1608.1
least if there's water up there it's not

1606.18 --> 1611.1200000000001
gonna be salt water that's interesting

1608.1 --> 1611.12
to know don't you think

1615.92 --> 1624.1200000000001
also because salt water conducts

1620.58 --> 1628.01
electricity right so if there's no salt

1624.12 --> 1631.62
water up there then is that water

1628.01 --> 1636.18
isolating the electricity of the

1631.62 --> 1638.84
presupposed ohm you know there's

1636.18 --> 1642.42
consequences to everything

1638.84 --> 1646.05
mechanically every presupposition you

1642.42 --> 1648.8400000000001
deviate or you realize it changes all

1646.05 --> 1651.72
the potential possibilities of whatever

1648.84 --> 1653.4299999999998
you're going to be presupposing I deal

1651.72 --> 1655.71
with this [ __ ] every day to me it's all

1653.43 --> 1660.14
like a multi-dimensional fractal of

1655.71 --> 1662.97
options every time some data pops up it

1660.14 --> 1665.18
points at several different things in

1662.97 --> 1668.16
several different angles and then

1665.18 --> 1673.92
changes it slightly that's what I deal

1668.16 --> 1676.38
with so yeah I can definitely speculate

1673.92 --> 1684.3600000000001
on dom-based called cosmic genie oh yeah

1676.38 --> 1688.68
I can and I have but I'm not

1684.36 --> 1691.34
particularly convinced of them maybe a

1688.68 --> 1691.3400000000001
flat top

1691.429 --> 1697.3390000000002
but I think it's just too

1693.559 --> 1701.269
straightforward you know what I mean I

1697.339 --> 1704.69
think that the design was made with such

1701.269 --> 1708.769
brilliance in such way that trickery had

1704.69 --> 1711.6190000000001
to be inherently there just the proof

1708.769 --> 1713.95
that he could and to make it interesting

1711.619 --> 1719.889
enough for the ascending brilliant

1713.95 --> 1719.8890000000001
humanity and to make it a real challenge

1722.2 --> 1728.1490000000001
that but yeah that's my I guess that's

1725.599 --> 1732.9189999999999
more philosophical angle to it

1728.149 --> 1734.57
it's just that seems to me like the the

1732.919 --> 1739.429
angle or the frequency or the

1734.57 --> 1744.139
methodology of the design so I am trying

1739.429 --> 1747.8890000000001
to more uniformly figure out like how

1744.139 --> 1750.049
it's probably gonna be by comparing it

1747.889 --> 1753.9189999999999
to how other things turned out to be

1750.049 --> 1757.7
deceptive and in what way a duality type

1753.919 --> 1761.5590000000002
of like everything seems to be showing

1757.7 --> 1761.559
something that is completely opposing

1764.83 --> 1774.9789999999998
presumption natural presumption so I'm

1770.629 --> 1778.879
just continue adding beyond that in my

1774.979 --> 1780.44
personal yeah deep digging like where

1778.879 --> 1782.539
normal people don't really get to

1780.44 --> 1787.009
because they're just too much stuck into

1782.539 --> 1790.07
trying to energy yeah a feed energy

1787.009 --> 1793.46
enhance certain specific type of set a

1790.07 --> 1795.08
set idea of how the world must be and

1793.46 --> 1797.1490000000001
then defending that as hard as possible

1795.08 --> 1800.059
that's what a lot of flat earthers are

1797.149 --> 1803.9889999999998
doing but I'm just digging digging for

1800.059 --> 1806.229
data digging for presuppositional angles

1803.989 --> 1808.789
to things and the significance of it all

1806.229 --> 1812.499
compared to one another because I am

1808.789 --> 1815.96
basically assuming that nobody knows

1812.499 --> 1817.96
really that's probably the most likely

1815.96 --> 1820.969
that there's people that know so much

1817.96 --> 1823.8790000000001
but they've already gained so much from

1820.969 --> 1824.93
the knowledge during their journey that

1823.879 --> 1827.84
they're like no I

1824.93 --> 1829.9
can't handle more but I'm definitely

1827.84 --> 1832.6399999999999
gonna try to prevent others from

1829.9 --> 1834.89
figuring out to this level or they might

1832.64 --> 1837.73
compete with me I think that's really

1834.89 --> 1837.73
what's going on

1840.28 --> 1844.18
I'm sure I'm serious

1851.2 --> 1856.5
because of the more you know about the

1853.0 --> 1861.45
world the more you figure out about

1856.5 --> 1865.78
physics and hidden wonders of technology

1861.45 --> 1868.96
that come with that and it's almost like

1865.78 --> 1872.92
people have been digging now into

1868.96 --> 1876.58
physics to find the nature of the realm

1872.92 --> 1881.2
but as we've dug for that reason we've

1876.58 --> 1883.48
also attained pretty heavy knowledge so

1881.2 --> 1885.7
just imagine how far people could take

1883.48 --> 1887.47
that and that day at some point just

1885.7 --> 1889.72
can't handle it anymore or they don't

1887.47 --> 1892.5
know way through but they yeah they

1889.72 --> 1895.9
already invested so much and they've

1892.5 --> 1899.17
they've built potential empires and

1895.9 --> 1900.13
they're just they don't they're just

1899.17 --> 1903.76
gonna hide it

1900.13 --> 1906.46
like no this is they're going to get

1903.76 --> 1911.28
keep it beyond the point where they

1906.46 --> 1911.28
couldn't go further that seems natural

1916.059 --> 1926.899
yeah yeah I seem to be suddenly looking

1925.07 --> 1935.119
into the deep I don't know where that

1926.899 --> 1937.1789999999999
came from but just yeah super chat twice

1935.119 --> 1941.9889999999998
did I miss super chats

1937.179 --> 1945.5890000000002
really oh I did oh my god man I was so

1941.989 --> 1948.049
much into the zone yeah Thank You Theo

1945.589 --> 1954.609
Megawati for these super chats twice to

1948.049 --> 1962.559
others it's not obstruction atmospheric

1954.609 --> 1965.6789999999999
occlusion causes the blue occlusion hmm

1962.559 --> 1965.6789999999999
what's that

1970.68 --> 1973.8690000000001
[Applause]

1974.34 --> 1981.55
blockage or closing of blood vessel or

1978.31 --> 1986.02
hollow are what the okay now that's

1981.55 --> 1989.05
medicine meteorology process by which

1986.02 --> 1991.09
the cold front for rotating low pressure

1989.05 --> 1999.22
system catch up to the warm so that warm

1991.09 --> 2003.57
air is I didn't know what no I don't

1999.22 --> 2010.56
think occlusion is a correct word in

2003.57 --> 2014.22
this context sorry maybe an improvised

2010.56 --> 2019.1
use of the world I think doesn't really

2014.22 --> 2019.1000000000001
fit I'm gonna take a bite of this

2047.28 --> 2054.75
I'm getting some feedback from Jessie in

2050.05 --> 2059.6200000000003
Skype when I posted the the optical slam

2054.75 --> 2063.57
picture diagram and yeah she basically

2059.62 --> 2066.159
said she brought that up I'm honored and

2063.57 --> 2068.44
a lot of people just tried to discredit

2066.159 --> 2072.3900000000003
it yeah I know this picture that picture

2068.44 --> 2077.4700000000003
that I showed that I just presented is

2072.39 --> 2084.85
at least two years old no I think even

2077.47 --> 2088.45
two and a half now or no wait I think

2084.85 --> 2091.0899999999997
like one and a half to two years old so

2088.45 --> 2093.25
yeah people were always just rejecting

2091.09 --> 2098.86
it on the globe site like outright I've

2093.25 --> 2100.42
never had any kind of genuine response

2098.86 --> 2105.19
from a global but that's also because

2100.42 --> 2108.28
yeah it is descriptive it's descriptive

2105.19 --> 2111.04
of the actual view it's almost like

2108.28 --> 2115.0
describing the painting of site itself

2111.04 --> 2118.18
and then giving some direct geometrical

2115.0 --> 2121.3
references and explanations to it but it

2118.18 --> 2125.83
doesn't really use the actual optical

2121.3 --> 2127.27
sciences it doesn't use that it's not

2125.83 --> 2131.59
that that's not what it is it's

2127.27 --> 2134.74
descriptive it's not yeah

2131.59 --> 2137.53
physics related because I find it very

2134.74 --> 2140.9199999999996
freakin difficult at the optics I used

2137.53 --> 2143.2900000000004
to like I got great visual insight and

2140.92 --> 2145.63
especially descriptive descriptive

2143.29 --> 2149.32
analysis that's like one of my primary

2145.63 --> 2152.35
skills but yeah the science is behind

2149.32 --> 2154.57
freaking optics it's just so oh my god

2152.35 --> 2159.21
it's like the next level of difficult

2154.57 --> 2159.21
compared compared to everything else so

2159.71 --> 2164.45
I've always had trouble with that and

2161.569 --> 2165.859
even with these new great people that

2164.45 --> 2168.859
are very good at it and have these

2165.859 --> 2172.54
excellent presentations it's still it

2168.859 --> 2174.89
still really won't stick all that well

2172.54 --> 2176.71
only on a superficial level it's like

2174.89 --> 2179.45
the same thing with programming

2176.71 --> 2182.2400000000002
I've seen people program I seen them

2179.45 --> 2184.819
explain what they were doing up until

2182.24 --> 2187.49
the point that they really got it it's

2184.819 --> 2190.3089999999997
just that I can't really do it myself

2187.49 --> 2192.14
and it's also the same with a lot of

2190.309 --> 2194.63
languages when I hear other people

2192.14 --> 2195.91
talking I can then suddenly start to

2194.63 --> 2198.6400000000003
tune in

2195.91 --> 2202.0989999999997
basically through their expressions

2198.64 --> 2205.3089999999997
trying to figure out what type of

2202.099 --> 2207.079
conversation they're having and then and

2205.309 --> 2210.5
then an even tune in and sometimes it

2207.079 --> 2214.369
clicks but actually speaking the

2210.5 --> 2217.7
language that's just then you really

2214.369 --> 2221.42
have to really get it and be good at it

2217.7 --> 2223.5789999999997
it has to come natural so yeah I got a

2221.42 --> 2226.549
lot of things that I know to a certain

2223.579 --> 2229.04
degree that I can adapt to but to take

2226.549 --> 2232.79
it all in that's that's something else

2229.04 --> 2235.849
just another approach to things it's

2232.79 --> 2239.17
fair it basically improvised a lot and I

2235.849 --> 2239.17
gotten really good at it

2247.94 --> 2251.13
[Music]

2259.19 --> 2268.05
mm-hmm yep models and predictions

2264.8 --> 2271.05
that's so funny isn't it because they

2268.05 --> 2274.0800000000004
literally do it and the thing that I

2271.05 --> 2277.17
talked about before they think that if

2274.08 --> 2281.61
information suggests something to be

2277.17 --> 2285.1800000000003
there then it must be there even if you

2281.61 --> 2290.82
can basically prove it scientifically

2285.18 --> 2293.6699999999996
and then they give if they that it yeah

2290.82 --> 2297.48
you can you can do that even though you

2293.67 --> 2299.31
can't physically alter it if you just

2297.48 --> 2301.5
can presuppose that you can somehow do

2299.31 --> 2305.58
it then one day you may do it that that

2301.5 --> 2307.95
[ __ ] oh by the way again thank you for

2305.58 --> 2312.35
the $2 super chat donation atmospheric

2307.95 --> 2317.6
occlusion causes the blue no wait that's

2312.35 --> 2317.6
that's the same I got stuck with my

2317.93 --> 2329.0899999999997
stupid now now I lost track

2345.14 --> 2358.69
but yeah the globus have mutated science

2352.4 --> 2363.34
into allowing presuppositional concepts

2358.69 --> 2367.31
to be taken as physical real reality

2363.34 --> 2370.46
it's it's literally corruption of

2367.31 --> 2372.35
science a corruption not just

2370.46 --> 2375.89
pseudoscience because people can like

2372.35 --> 2379.91
wildly science fiction speculate no

2375.89 --> 2383.69
that's or like get into really difficult

2379.91 --> 2389.21
territory still yeah see the show

2383.69 --> 2392.27
effects but yeah it's become ethereal or

2389.21 --> 2395.65
something like you don't intention for

2392.27 --> 2400.52
example it's like that's not physical

2395.65 --> 2402.59
it's experienced it does something but

2400.52 --> 2404.5099999999998
it's not really physical you know so

2402.59 --> 2409.01
yeah that's the kind of pseudoscience

2404.51 --> 2411.44
but if it's just completely conceptual

2409.01 --> 2413.6600000000003
and there's nothing even to the change

2411.44 --> 2415.43
if you're going to be changing other

2413.66 --> 2418.5499999999997
things then it's completely a

2415.43 --> 2421.22
theoretical structure and the globus

2418.55 --> 2422.75
accept this and thus yeah everything

2421.22 --> 2424.3999999999996
will be about models and about

2422.75 --> 2426.38
predictions because that has become

2424.4 --> 2429.32
their main focus not the actual

2426.38 --> 2432.86
foundation they just skip the foundation

2429.32 --> 2436.9300000000003
every time they're building castles in

2432.86 --> 2443.92
the clouds constantly their dreamers and

2436.93 --> 2446.12
they think they're real see

2443.92 --> 2448.9900000000002
and you can get kind of sick of it

2446.12 --> 2451.25
because they're like very painfully

2448.99 --> 2455.72
delusional and they've turn everything

2451.25 --> 2459.92
around and they got they got consent

2455.72 --> 2462.98
from their slave masters who say yeah it

2459.92 --> 2465.34
is like this just keep on doing what

2462.98 --> 2465.34
you're doing

2475.99 --> 2482.0699999999997
I'll tell you next week city regions

2478.41 --> 2482.0699999999997
it's really cute

2503.72 --> 2511.22
No pater from they were not delusional

2507.05 --> 2516.4700000000003
because you don't assume things that are

2511.22 --> 2520.0989999999997
obviously not true but because you

2516.47 --> 2526.4599999999996
overlook things that compromise the

2520.099 --> 2532.51
whole so you politicize your belief your

2526.46 --> 2532.51
goal and that is a form of corruption

2533.05 --> 2536.9300000000003
you're not being honest to yourself and

2535.579 --> 2540.5890000000004
to nobody

2536.93 --> 2542.23
you're upholding this vision because of

2540.589 --> 2544.339
the mass of it because of the body

2542.23 --> 2546.8
everything in the history that is

2544.339 --> 2550.089
presented it's so ingrained in all of

2546.8 --> 2552.92
all things media society schools and

2550.089 --> 2555.859
that's what you're leaning on not on

2552.92 --> 2558.849
whether it is true or not no you've all

2555.859 --> 2563.3489999999997
devised learning techniques

2558.849 --> 2566.03
psychological tricks in order to avoid

2563.349 --> 2571.28
personal confrontation with things that

2566.03 --> 2574.28
compromise the belief that it all works

2571.28 --> 2576.71
out you have built in cognitive

2574.28 --> 2579.26
dissonance systems that activate and

2576.71 --> 2583.7
it's all accept that everybody does it

2579.26 --> 2586.7000000000003
on the globe side so you've become

2583.7 --> 2589.8489999999997
attuned to that frequency to that way of

2586.7 --> 2591.589
doing things including the subconscious

2589.849 --> 2595.78
elements of cognitive dissonance

2591.589 --> 2595.7799999999997
it's very strongly there

2603.81 --> 2611.67
yeah your overall focus is on to just

2609.98 --> 2614.46
peer pressure

2611.67 --> 2616.98
the main focus is peer pressure and the

2614.46 --> 2619.23
medium is the body of science

2616.98 --> 2622.8
information that's just a medium it's a

2619.23 --> 2626.1
storytelling medium for you to apply a

2622.8 --> 2630.8700000000003
belief and peer pressure and to cover up

2626.1 --> 2633.42
holes with technobabble that's your

2630.87 --> 2636.5099999999998
tradition that is what you do that's

2633.42 --> 2638.91
what all of you do take that body of

2636.51 --> 2642.8100000000004
information of all these stories all

2638.91 --> 2645.0899999999997
these assumptions put it together and

2642.81 --> 2647.85
you use that as a storytelling medium

2645.09 --> 2649.77
you can always pick something and then

2647.85 --> 2653.19
in the meantime you apply peer pressure

2649.77 --> 2654.84
and claim Authority with it and ridicule

2653.19 --> 2658.55
your position and that is your main

2654.84 --> 2658.55
focus all of the time

2662.89 --> 2668.98
although to be fair there is sometimes

2665.47 --> 2671.35
like a side effect almost like sort of

2668.98 --> 2673.33
you comfort you get comfortable with

2671.35 --> 2675.97
other ballers like okay we're in safe

2673.33 --> 2677.83
now we've defeated the flat earthers in

2675.97 --> 2680.29
our minds and then you go out discussing

2677.83 --> 2683.79
little details and then already little

2680.29 --> 2686.02
conflicts arrive like oh but this person

2683.79 --> 2687.31
conceptualized it slightly like this and

2686.02 --> 2689.32
maybe it could be that and the other one

2687.31 --> 2691.42
no but it's in the other way you're

2689.32 --> 2693.79
getting it wrong and then you're even

2691.42 --> 2698.13
conflicting naturally within your own

2693.79 --> 2701.11
model that is supposed to be unified

2698.13 --> 2703.63
flat-earthers don't do that they just

2701.11 --> 2706.81
have different approaches because we

2703.63 --> 2709.03
don't have a unified model which is our

2706.81 --> 2711.24
strengths even though you have learned

2709.03 --> 2715.0
that that is a weakness to you

2711.24 --> 2717.6099999999997
unification is essential to your sight

2715.0 --> 2719.98
to ours not for us it's all a journey of

2717.61 --> 2722.65
discovery but we do still as humans have

2719.98 --> 2726.07
tendency to group together and try to

2722.65 --> 2728.7400000000002
use the masses as a strength it's a

2726.07 --> 2731.02
natural tendency of all humans but we're

2728.74 --> 2735.52
basically all individuals trying to

2731.02 --> 2737.64
figure out things to to really expand

2735.52 --> 2741.54
the knowledge and not to build a

2737.64 --> 2746.31
overarching framework to seal it all off

2741.54 --> 2746.31
which is what the globe earth is

2748.26 --> 2755.2400000000002
it's a giant relate religion to seal off

2751.47 --> 2755.24
all that knowledge

2771.43 --> 2775.79
see even the way you're saying that

2774.56 --> 2782.12
Pedro from there I find it very

2775.79 --> 2784.7
fascinating he says I did just did my

2782.12 --> 2791.21
own research and found proof that the

2784.7 --> 2794.33
earth can never be flat Wow that is

2791.21 --> 2798.1
fascinating he must not have done a very

2794.33 --> 2801.29
wide research because I've

2798.1 --> 2807.41
conceptualized all kinds of ways the

2801.29 --> 2813.62
earth could be and flat was definitely

2807.41 --> 2816.3199999999997
among them in various ways so seems like

2813.62 --> 2819.5299999999997
again you've just made a political

2816.32 --> 2821.8700000000003
statement to basically create wizardry a

2819.53 --> 2824.75
delusion to yourself and to everyone out

2821.87 --> 2827.48
there you're addressing that it can

2824.75 --> 2832.1
never be flat even though that is kind

2827.48 --> 2835.7
of a weird thing to say because actual

2832.1 --> 2839.5899999999997
research proves that flat is definitely

2835.7 --> 2841.79
among the possibilities in multiple ways

2839.59 --> 2844.3
although it's not the only option

2841.79 --> 2844.3
obviously

2847.42 --> 2853.41
so thank you for proving my my little

2850.809 --> 2853.4100000000003
speech there

2876.78 --> 2888.27
come on me come on bring in some more

2881.47 --> 2888.27
body of science just more data you know

2888.93 --> 2895.47
the data and digging through the data is

2892.45 --> 2898.3599999999997
a good way to reinforce the belief that

2895.47 --> 2902.23
it's all real and to distract you again

2898.36 --> 2904.8700000000003
from moments where suddenly you realize

2902.23 --> 2907.72
that things that you've said might not

2904.87 --> 2910.99
be as good as you thought when you were

2907.72 --> 2914.02
saying it so you just bring up more body

2910.99 --> 2919.0899999999997
of science more little details mor more

2914.02 --> 2920.89
playground to distract and to reinforce

2919.09 --> 2922.9900000000002
that comforting feeling like yeah it's

2920.89 --> 2925.6
all worth it because there's just so

2922.99 --> 2928.45
much of it thank you

2925.6 --> 2934.35
Unicorn laser eyes for the super chat

2928.45 --> 2937.7999999999997
donation that's that's a really cool

2934.35 --> 2937.7999999999997
really cool name

2950.27 --> 2964.38
ma'am I really loved those apples about

2956.64 --> 2969.71
their big it's like eating a double

2964.38 --> 2969.71
sandwich except it's an apple

2987.65 --> 2997.4700000000003
Wow you know it's just amazing the type

2995.4 --> 3001.099
of names that are coming forward on the

2997.47 --> 3004.3999999999996
globe side so super curve you said watch

3001.099 --> 3015.71
a Feynman lecture you know what if what

3004.4 --> 3019.09
Fame is right let me make sure before I

3015.71 --> 3019.09
make a fool out of myself again

3024.27 --> 3030.91
right

3026.349 --> 3035.1400000000003
yep theoretical physicist quantum

3030.91 --> 3038.109
mechanics theory of quantum

3035.14 --> 3042.819
electrodynamics superfluid blaa blaa

3038.109 --> 3048.13
blaa okay yeah it was a particle issed

3042.819 --> 3050.799
this is a microsphere religious

3048.13 --> 3052.9
scientist okay or well scientist

3050.799 --> 3055.089
theoretical scientists is obviously the

3052.9 --> 3056.859
literal first thing that is basically

3055.089 --> 3058.509
mentioned about him because that's

3056.859 --> 3063.249
pretty much what he is a theoretical

3058.509 --> 3066.309
scientist which is well unless he does

3063.249 --> 3070.269
actual physical things with his theories

3066.309 --> 3075.989
is a pseudo scientist a speculator using

3070.269 --> 3079.7189999999996
math as a platform and presupposition so

3075.989 --> 3083.4990000000003
yeah that's nice

3079.719 --> 3087.309
I have a lot of doubts about quantum

3083.499 --> 3092.2189999999996
mechanics huge amount and I know John is

3087.309 --> 3098.259
like gonna be me I don't give a [ __ ]

3092.219 --> 3103.089
because I think that yeah the Assumption

3098.259 --> 3108.63
on which quantum physics rest is based

3103.089 --> 3112.3289999999997
on a misunderstanding and I'm particle

3108.63 --> 3115.239
presupposition mostly of light and

3112.329 --> 3117.6600000000003
electrons and I'm starting to dig

3115.239 --> 3122.559
through this more and more and give

3117.66 --> 3124.8689999999997
bypass it just completely bypass it it's

3122.559 --> 3127.049
not need anymore there's things are not

3124.869 --> 3129.4590000000003
all particles some light is beams

3127.049 --> 3133.269
instantaneous beams there is no speed of

3129.459 --> 3137.859
light it is instantaneous and eternally

3133.269 --> 3140.68
divisible whatever it does however it

3137.859 --> 3142.119
changes alters and then there's

3140.68 --> 3147.1299999999997
electrons and I don't think really

3142.119 --> 3152.4500000000003
they're particles either it's just

3147.13 --> 3155.96
they're just connections there arcs it's

3152.45 --> 3159.4399999999996
there like they line up and suddenly

3155.96 --> 3164.66
there's a loop that's electricity it's

3159.44 --> 3165.71
the loop it just bang and yeah I've

3164.66 --> 3167.72
talked about it

3165.71 --> 3170.0
for example lightning it's pretty much

3167.72 --> 3171.6499999999996
instantaneous but in some cases there's

3170.0 --> 3174.5
different types of lightning where it

3171.65 --> 3177.62
starts crawling like a claw and that

3174.5 --> 3179.39
actually has a speed but it's also a

3177.62 --> 3183.41
very specific process because what

3179.39 --> 3187.25
happens is that the beam remains pretty

3183.41 --> 3192.47
much instantaneous not traveling like

3187.25 --> 3194.99
you know it's intent aeneas constantly

3192.47 --> 3196.6
as it crawls and then when it goes away

3194.99 --> 3200.7799999999997
it all goes away

3196.6 --> 3206.47
it's not like a rod being fired or

3200.78 --> 3206.4700000000003
launched no so I don't have any

3206.62 --> 3213.95
empirical data that tells me that

3210.05 --> 3216.2000000000003
electricity moves at speeds and the same

3213.95 --> 3219.89
goes for a light and when you go into

3216.2 --> 3221.5099999999998
that that medium if you are gonna start

3219.89 --> 3225.25
looking it like that yeah quantum

3221.51 --> 3225.25
physics is just completely useless

3228.369 --> 3233.0190000000002
so yeah and I'm doing that now that

3232.15 --> 3235.119
doesn't mean that there aren't

3233.019 --> 3239.1899999999996
interesting phenomena like the double

3235.119 --> 3241.4500000000003
slit experiment that is still what it is

3239.19 --> 3243.789
it's just a matter of what the co type

3241.45 --> 3246.279
of conclusions are the angle to it if

3243.789 --> 3248.38
you're good like what are they literally

3246.279 --> 3251.079
doing if they are firing presupposes

3248.38 --> 3254.8900000000003
particles are they or are they literally

3251.079 --> 3259.569
just beaming light through that is

3254.89 --> 3263.8289999999997
basically shut off at a certain point in

3259.569 --> 3268.69
order to achieve a specific minimum

3263.829 --> 3270.13
registered light quanta in the case of

3268.69 --> 3273.489
light and with electrons

3270.13 --> 3274.9300000000003
maybe this I don't even know what to

3273.489 --> 3278.039
think about that what they're really

3274.93 --> 3280.96
doing when firing supposes electrons I

3278.039 --> 3282.969
don't know what that is I don't know how

3280.96 --> 3285.43
they do that I'd have to look into that

3282.969 --> 3287.259
more technically as to the supposed

3285.43 --> 3289.5989999999997
mechanism that is doing that but I'm

3287.259 --> 3293.38
pretty sure it's gonna be a man-made set

3289.599 --> 3295.509
up in a very complex way so technically

3293.38 --> 3302.4990000000003
that already kind of makes it outside of

3295.509 --> 3304.809
the science the whole thing you know but

3302.499 --> 3309.839
that's just me I know quantum eraser is

3304.809 --> 3309.8390000000004
gonna disagree with that and you know

3331.589 --> 3339.42
okay gleam I I'm not really getting what

3336.029 --> 3341.609
you're saying at the moment but it's

3339.42 --> 3345.39
it's something I pretty much started

3341.609 --> 3347.3089999999997
digging into yesterday like it's

3345.39 --> 3350.009
rekindled I liked

3347.309 --> 3351.719
I've already had hints of it you know I

3350.009 --> 3354.989
brought these types of subjects up like

3351.719 --> 3356.4
light being an instantaneous beam this

3354.989 --> 3358.229
is typically how it is just how I

3356.4 --> 3360.1800000000003
brought up the holographic Sun I just

3358.229 --> 3363.6299999999997
see it and I can't really explain it yet

3360.18 --> 3366.299
just know like no this is no that other

3363.63 --> 3371.2490000000003
thing is wrong it's probably more like

3366.299 --> 3372.599
this until it feels right and yeah I'm

3371.249 --> 3376.499
going with that and I'm now moving

3372.599 --> 3378.839
further so I'm gonna try to see how much

3376.499 --> 3381.0589999999997
of quantum physics is real and how much

3378.839 --> 3385.799
is purely theoretical physics based on

3381.059 --> 3388.17
particle assumption and I need to know

3385.799 --> 3390.119
these mechanisms that are supposedly

3388.17 --> 3392.849
used in these experiments I need to

3390.119 --> 3395.579
figure out what it is that it is really

3392.849 --> 3397.38
happening in them because it is of

3395.579 --> 3400.0190000000002
course all explained through the

3397.38 --> 3401.9390000000003
particle assumption always but that

3400.019 --> 3404.279
doesn't mean that it is that so I have

3401.939 --> 3408.509
to understand what that thing is what it

3404.279 --> 3413.69
really is they do and then figure it out

3408.509 --> 3416.88
through that see what I mean so

3413.69 --> 3416.88
[Music]

3437.33 --> 3448.14
you know what I also think about quantum

3442.32 --> 3450.78
mechanics I think what happened with it

3448.14 --> 3454.47
once the concept arrived is that it was

3450.78 --> 3458.82
literally basically used to start

3454.47 --> 3462.5989999999997
explaining psychic phenomena to start to

3458.82 --> 3468.56
try to move in on it and give it a

3462.599 --> 3473.07
ground for physical for physics to turn

3468.56 --> 3474.7799999999997
psychic elements into physics or - yeah

3473.07 --> 3476.07
border I think it might have been done a

3474.78 --> 3478.77
rich into that because I've already

3476.07 --> 3483.1400000000003
heard so many quantum theories that

3478.77 --> 3486.119
would tie in to synchronized thinking

3483.14 --> 3490.56
remote contact remote viewing all that

3486.119 --> 3493.23
quantum mechanics would be Oh yack would

3490.56 --> 3496.7
always be kind of border to it or drug

3493.23 --> 3499.589
into it I think it was designed for that

3496.7 --> 3504.83
or it was at least promoted for that

3499.589 --> 3507.27
reason to try to get that in there and

3504.83 --> 3511.3199999999997
it doesn't make sense to me at all

3507.27 --> 3513.3
doesn't feel like the angle to that it's

3511.32 --> 3515.96
a look at everything quantum mechanics

3513.3 --> 3519.69
always freaking chance based and [ __ ]

3515.96 --> 3521.9700000000003
well these psychic elements in these

3519.69 --> 3524.16
intuitions there have nothing to do with

3521.97 --> 3528.4199999999996
chance which they're actually extremely

3524.16 --> 3530.49
reliable that's bizarre thing about it

3528.42 --> 3532.9500000000003
the so it's not like this weird remote

3530.49 --> 3536.9399999999996
chance effect that quantum mechanics

3532.95 --> 3538.5299999999997
tends to deal with although it is

3536.94 --> 3541.589
suggested yeah there is something about

3538.53 --> 3543.63
knowing data and all that oh that's more

3541.589 --> 3545.43
like again an overarching

3543.63 --> 3550.08
extra-dimensional you would always say

3545.43 --> 3553.8799999999997
is the real angle to it but that's not

3550.08 --> 3556.77
really the quantum mechanics itself I

3553.88 --> 3560.3
think

3556.77 --> 3564.92
so yeah I hope you guys appreciate me

3560.3 --> 3567.3
getting into this subject I did people

3564.92 --> 3573.03
okay Pedro from they won't edit me on

3567.3 --> 3574.7400000000002
skype interesting might be good

3573.03 --> 3577.11
who knows you know Pedro from that way

3574.74 --> 3586.5299999999997
if you want to get on my show sometime

3577.11 --> 3588.3900000000003
if you dare might be good anyway yeah

3586.53 --> 3590.7900000000004
I'm gonna round out the show because

3588.39 --> 3594.54
I've been going for an hour and it's

3590.79 --> 3596.91
it's been very good I like this show I

3594.54 --> 3600.69
liked being able to get into this pretty

3596.91 --> 3605.7
complicated subject and not get stuck or

3600.69 --> 3610.17
something so yeah thanks everyone for

3605.7 --> 3613.0499999999997
coming I hope you enjoyed the show if

3610.17 --> 3614.31
you have them please up fold it and if

3613.05 --> 3616.02
you haven't already subscribed to my

3614.31 --> 3617.67
channel and hit the bell notifications

3616.02 --> 3619.65
so you know when I'm going live which is

3617.67 --> 3620.01
normally 2:00 p.m. Amsterdam time every

3619.65 --> 3622.59
day

3620.01 --> 3625.8
please also support my show through the

3622.59 --> 3628.46
Super chats as I've some people done

3625.8 --> 3631.38
today thank you again for that and

3628.46 --> 3634.02
PayPal's also very welcome it's probably

3631.38 --> 3634.6800000000003
the best the most useful source to me at

3634.02 --> 3637.53
this point

3634.68 --> 3640.56
so please do consider and of course the

3637.53 --> 3643.369
other projects and patreon and go fund

3640.56 --> 3649.94
me which I will eventually spend a

3643.369 --> 3653.8500000000004
marathon on but not feel like this I

3649.94 --> 3657.27
will be back tomorrow with Flat Earth

3653.85 --> 3659.49
early-bird number 205 also gonna join

3657.27 --> 3661.41
the debates after this I think I don't

3659.49 --> 3667.859
know how active I will be we'll see

3661.41 --> 3670.79
and yeah until the next show keep it

3667.859 --> 3670.79
flat

3672.53 --> 3703.679
