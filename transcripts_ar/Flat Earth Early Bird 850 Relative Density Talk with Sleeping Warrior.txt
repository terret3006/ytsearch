78.0 --> 81.78
right so it is

80.52 --> 85.67999999999999
quite

81.78 --> 88.08
beautiful weather out there again

85.68 --> 90.18
very similar to yesterday except with

88.08 --> 91.979
one difference there are some trills up

90.18 --> 95.4
there

91.979 --> 97.5
and yeah there's a lot of wind

95.4 --> 98.88000000000001
happening you don't really see it as

97.5 --> 100.32
much

98.88 --> 103.86
but it's still

100.32 --> 107.63999999999999
out there and it's kind of cold

103.86 --> 110.03999999999999
so yeah if you stand in a windless spot

107.64 --> 111.86
it's really warm

110.04 --> 115.38000000000001
but as soon as you get out in the open

111.86 --> 117.799
yeah that it turns out not to be that

115.38 --> 117.79899999999999
warm

118.74 --> 123.899
so inside like I'm wearing shorts right

121.86 --> 125.159
now but if I'm gonna go outside I'm

123.899 --> 128.64
gonna put on

125.159 --> 131.42000000000002
just the regular attire

128.64 --> 131.42
because it is

131.459 --> 136.08
fresh out there

133.379 --> 138.84
and a chili with that wind

136.08 --> 141.42000000000002
but yeah great Sun it really feels like

138.84 --> 143.81900000000002
a summer day

141.42 --> 146.51999999999998
or early spring day

143.819 --> 150.06
maybe that's better comparison

146.52 --> 152.76000000000002
right hello iron 26 good to see you

150.06 --> 155.599
that's spring

152.76 --> 155.599
well yeah

155.819 --> 161.879
hmm

157.92 --> 164.879
so it is April 1st

161.879 --> 164.879
2021.

165.66 --> 168.14
Thursday

168.36 --> 174.62
I do not have

170.04 --> 174.62
an April Fool's joke planned

177.3 --> 181.31900000000002
yeah I don't really feel like tomfoolery

180.12 --> 184.09900000000002
anyway

181.319 --> 184.099
right now

186.959 --> 192.18
had a bit of a busy morning that's why

189.66 --> 194.04
I'm also a little late although yeah do

192.18 --> 195.239
I really need an excuse to be a little

194.04 --> 198.48
late

195.239 --> 201.12
because it's gonna happen

198.48 --> 204.56
but yeah I had an appointment to work

201.12 --> 204.56
out some technical issues

205.68 --> 211.87900000000002
with them a lawyer and all that

208.319 --> 211.879
getting the funding for it

212.04 --> 218.78
but yeah I still managed to get back in

215.22 --> 218.78
time for the show

218.879 --> 221.54
all right

222.68 --> 227.239
uh

224.4 --> 227.239
yesterday

228.36 --> 235.34
uh

231.239 --> 235.34
Flat Earth debate was interesting

236.459 --> 240.42000000000002
and later on Brandon's as well but I

239.04 --> 242.28
don't know why I didn't make a lot of

240.42 --> 244.379
notes about it

242.28 --> 246.42
I wonder why

244.379 --> 249.17999999999998
I don't know something was really

246.42 --> 252.35999999999999
distracting me yesterday

249.18 --> 256.38
maybe it's like the springtime

252.36 --> 258.29900000000004
we discussing the Merle thing oh

256.38 --> 261.06
goody

258.299 --> 264.419
right yeah he also came back on

261.06 --> 267.479
Brandon's again yesterday

264.419 --> 269.69899999999996
although I put it on mute

267.479 --> 271.08
because I was also listening back to the

269.699 --> 273.6
Flat Earth debate

271.08 --> 277.139
from the Monday and that was a pretty

273.6 --> 278.82000000000005
good show so I was intent on hearing

277.139 --> 280.979
that show out

278.82 --> 283.21999999999997
while keeping the Brandon chat in the

280.979 --> 283.21999999999997
background

283.86 --> 288.41900000000004
but sure we can discuss the situation

286.86 --> 290.759
you know

288.419 --> 292.5
I guess

290.759 --> 295.199
that well

292.5 --> 298.199
I have a Daily Show two hours just me

295.199 --> 299.759
talking with Chad I'm things that are

298.199 --> 302.04
going to be on people's mind are gonna

299.759 --> 304.62
come to the table so I guess I'm going

302.04 --> 307.40000000000003
to be talking about other people

304.62 --> 307.4
this is

308.22 --> 314.6
that's what you want

311.16 --> 314.6
hello foulon Buchanan

316.56 --> 320.72
so yeah what do you want to discuss

318.18 --> 320.72
about it

331.68 --> 336.919
you were getting hit pretty hard with

333.72 --> 336.91900000000004
trollets yeah no [ __ ]

338.94 --> 345.12
but that whole day was pretty nutty like

342.78 --> 349.46
at Brandon's too remember with the Bob

345.12 --> 349.46
did anybody actually watch that back

351.84 --> 357.29999999999995
it was weird yesterday I kind of tried

355.02 --> 360.479
to go around and tell people like yeah I

357.3 --> 364.02000000000004
went hat on this happened and it seems

360.479 --> 365.52
like everybody got muted

364.02 --> 369.479
like

365.52 --> 373.979
not by somebody else but they just

369.479 --> 376.25899999999996
didn't really respond so I don't know

373.979 --> 379.25899999999996
man did I do something wrong

376.259 --> 382.88
did I do something wrong

379.259 --> 382.88
is it is it my fault again

383.46 --> 389.28
should I have just hold my tongue and

386.34 --> 391.67999999999995
just be the better man

389.28 --> 395.81899999999996
and let them watch all over my character

391.68 --> 399.199
and everything lie about me

395.819 --> 399.199
should I just do that

399.419 --> 404.24
yeah I got some mixed responses from

402.06 --> 404.24
that

404.759 --> 409.91900000000004
well done for calling Baba right but

407.46 --> 413.15999999999997
there's what calling out you know

409.919 --> 414.96
like this situation is totally nuts with

413.16 --> 419.28000000000003
him it's nuts

414.96 --> 421.62
because he references that I that I

419.28 --> 425.039
basically played or I didn't even play

421.62 --> 428.24
it on my show that I referenced and

425.039 --> 431.699
responded to a clip from way back

428.24 --> 434.1
ye brings that up like it's some kind of

431.699 --> 438.0
a badge of honor

434.1 --> 441.139
and he's imagining how I'm doing that

438.0 --> 444.06
specifically because I don't like his

441.139 --> 445.74
incoherent dielectric

444.06 --> 451.08
ah

445.74 --> 451.08
Theory this is completely preposterous

452.699 --> 458.22
so he brings that [ __ ] up constantly

455.16 --> 462.38000000000005
like it's a badge of honor

458.22 --> 462.38000000000005
and he strawmans me in the process

462.72 --> 469.38000000000005
like I'm pretty sure that since that

465.84 --> 471.73999999999995
time I did that hangout yeah the overall

469.38 --> 471.74
amount

471.919 --> 477.419
that the subject has been literally

474.78 --> 480.0
addressed

477.419 --> 482.34
I think he's pretty much outdone me like

480.0 --> 484.08
by a hundred times

482.34 --> 486.0
at least

484.08 --> 487.8
because I don't really talk about it

486.0 --> 489.78
that much like I don't like talking

487.8 --> 493.08
about it

489.78 --> 496.19899999999996
he seems to like talking about it a lot

493.08 --> 500.15999999999997
and now I'm the Batman for attacking

496.199 --> 503.099
another Rider oh yeah because I'm

500.16 --> 505.62
attacking a flower Flat Earth right

503.099 --> 508.5
that's what I'm doing are witness

505.62 --> 511.46
attacking another flat earther oh

508.5 --> 511.46
all right

515.64 --> 518.06
right

518.459 --> 524.5989999999999
oh oops that's the wrong button

521.219 --> 524.599
sorry about that AGM

529.32 --> 532.279
but yes

536.64 --> 541.4399999999999
and he doesn't seem to understand that

538.74 --> 545.04
I'm not a total savonia about it I just

541.44 --> 549.0
called him out and I left it to it

545.04 --> 551.16
I'm not making a fuss about it he is a

549.0 --> 553.92
lot of us

551.16 --> 556.56
while straw Manning me like I'm some

553.92 --> 559.62
Savannah obsessed character constantly

556.56 --> 562.92
trying to character assassinate him

559.62 --> 568.279
it's exactly quite the opposite

562.92 --> 568.279
like he's doing a Hillary Clinton on me

568.32 --> 573.12
it's literally accusing me of everything

570.24 --> 574.62
that he is currently engaging in towards

573.12 --> 578.42
me

574.62 --> 578.42
it's typical

578.88 --> 583.68
all right if you didn't see it iron 26

581.22 --> 587.24
then go watch it

583.68 --> 587.2399999999999
it's now two days ago

587.7 --> 594.1800000000001
talked about it yesterday on the show

591.06 --> 598.0799999999999
even linked to it

594.18 --> 601.26
right anyway the Merle situation

598.08 --> 605.339
I don't pay a lot of attention to Merle

601.26 --> 608.3389999999999
I've already like personally to his face

605.339 --> 610.86
try to be friendly confronted him with

608.339 --> 612.899
certain things that he does

610.86 --> 616.26
and how it's bad

612.899 --> 618.839
and then when somebody reminds me

616.26 --> 622.8
you're doing something bad now

618.839 --> 624.24
then he doubles down on it and gets even

622.8 --> 626.519
worse

624.24 --> 630.019
it's like an oppositionally defiant

626.519 --> 630.019
six-year-old response

630.36 --> 635.22
and that's why I said and I will keep

633.66 --> 637.98
saying that like yeah morals this is

635.22 --> 640.7
pretty cool until he gets triggered and

637.98 --> 644.1
then he turns into a freaking demon like

640.7 --> 647.279
seriously not just who has elements no

644.1 --> 649.32
he just turns into one

647.279 --> 651.66
completely out of his mind

649.32 --> 655.74
when he's like that

651.66 --> 658.74
and I guess he got triggered he was in a

655.74 --> 660.9590000000001
bad mood when on yesterday's show or was

658.74 --> 664.44
the day before I don't even remember I

660.959 --> 666.7199999999999
accidentally blocked him when he popped

664.44 --> 668.4590000000001
up in my chat

666.72 --> 670.2
while I was in the middle of a troll

668.459 --> 672.4799999999999
barrage

670.2 --> 675.12
and so he got so triggered over it that

672.48 --> 677.399
he thought it's necessary to go out and

675.12 --> 679.44
then complain about me

677.399 --> 681.6
for like half an hour on the Flat Earth

679.44 --> 684.74
debate

681.6 --> 684.74
and then beyond

693.72 --> 696.38
what

698.1 --> 704.12
that's what kind of a remark is that in

701.22 --> 704.12
Ironwood 26

705.839 --> 710.4590000000001
did he go full Merle again miss all the

709.38 --> 713.519
fun

710.459 --> 717.42
I don't know man I don't think it's fun

713.519 --> 719.339
I think it's bad it's bad for him

717.42 --> 722.579
his own Mental Health

719.339 --> 727.2600000000001
and I think it's bad for his image and I

722.579 --> 729.4799999999999
think is bad for Flat Earth but yeah

727.26 --> 732.56
you know it's not like he's the only one

729.48 --> 736.04
out there like I sometimes have my own

732.56 --> 736.04
issues you know

737.7 --> 741.72
I'm just really doing my best to grow

740.459 --> 744.779
out of it

741.72 --> 746.64
to improve to not just keep going

744.779 --> 749.279
through the same cycle but actually

746.64 --> 751.62
improving which it's with each cycle I'm

749.279 --> 755.04
kind of fanatic about that like really

751.62 --> 757.32
fanatic as in if I notice that I'm

755.04 --> 759.24
failing on the long run that I'm not

757.32 --> 762.839
succeeding with this

759.24 --> 763.74
like my ego is going to freaking punish

762.839 --> 766.2
me

763.74 --> 767.639
it does

766.2 --> 770.339
because

767.639 --> 772.26
this system the system of continual

770.339 --> 776.22
Improvement is pretty much the only

772.26 --> 778.62
thing I have to keep him under control

776.22 --> 781.0790000000001
under all the pressure and the

778.62 --> 783.9590000000001
discontent

781.079 --> 788.66
with a lot of things in the world

783.959 --> 792.899
right so if I don't if I let it slide

788.66 --> 796.38
sink back into Old railroads my ego will

792.899 --> 797.399
take notice and will punish the [ __ ] out

796.38 --> 800.959
of me

797.399 --> 806.16
like with nightmares and just horrible

800.959 --> 806.16
self feelings right so

806.7 --> 810.6800000000001
I'm gonna do this one way or the other

813.24 --> 816.26
I'm doing it

817.019 --> 823.86
Harry Potter reference though

819.6 --> 823.86
I I don't know I

827.72 --> 835.74
like I think Owen Benjamin would respond

831.72 --> 840.839
to that like I don't know any sodomy

835.74 --> 844.04
lore it's iron 26 as in yeah Harry

840.839 --> 844.0400000000001
Potter is freaking gay

845.94 --> 851.519
it's not that gay well yeah okay it's a

850.139 --> 853.74
matter of opinion

851.519 --> 856.44
I don't know it I don't know any Harry

853.74 --> 859.26
Potter Laura I think that the Magic in

856.44 --> 861.1800000000001
there is really special boy Magic

859.26 --> 863.8199999999999
there's no actual

861.18 --> 865.7399999999999
serious personal skill that is being

863.82 --> 868.2600000000001
attributed to Magic it's just freaking

865.74 --> 870.48
CGI [ __ ] Magic

868.26 --> 872.1
I I'm not very impressed with Harry

870.48 --> 873.72
Potter overall

872.1 --> 875.94
it's kind of

873.72 --> 878.88
meh

875.94 --> 882.24
I mean the original ideas utilizing it

878.88 --> 885.24
like having a an extra dimensional space

882.24 --> 887.399
for magic users and all that yeah that's

885.24 --> 890.399
interesting hey

887.399 --> 892.26
compacted space looping systems yeah

890.399 --> 894.72
yeah that's the interesting part about

892.26 --> 896.279
it and pretty much the only interesting

894.72 --> 898.26
part about it

896.279 --> 901.3389999999999
right that's where my interest kind of

898.26 --> 901.3389999999999
halts after that point

902.519 --> 906.5600000000001
better than what's wrong with genov

909.18 --> 913.579
I don't see anything wrong with ganov

925.019 --> 929.339
a Terra 306

927.24 --> 932.54
what does he even do

929.339 --> 934.3800000000001
what what does Gandalf do

932.54 --> 938.579
Gandalf

934.38 --> 941.3389999999999
pretty much is well the wizard he

938.579 --> 943.26
worries he is trying to puzzle

941.339 --> 947.1600000000001
everything together

943.26 --> 949.079
to ensure that all the pieces are in

947.16 --> 950.88
place that the right people know the

949.079 --> 953.399
right information in order for

950.88 --> 956.24
everything to survive that's what

953.399 --> 956.24
Gandalf does

960.92 --> 968.06
what does he do he dies oh hey that's

964.079 --> 968.06
Tony calling me up all right

968.22 --> 971.1800000000001
hey hello

975.3 --> 979.04
yesterday or the day before

979.98 --> 985.0790000000001
yeah the day before I went on right

982.8 --> 987.62
against him I don't know if you picked

985.079 --> 987.62
up on that

990.48 --> 993.139
all right

997.339 --> 1001.1600000000001
the politician thing when he goes around

999.72 --> 1002.4200000000001
he makes friends with everybody yeah no

1001.16 --> 1004.699
[ __ ]

1002.42 --> 1007.04
yeah I know

1004.699 --> 1009.68
I don't but hold on let me do a check

1007.04 --> 1010.759
can anybody hear Sleeping Warrior over

1009.68 --> 1014.8
Skype

1010.759 --> 1014.8000000000001
in chat please let me know

1015.199 --> 1019.3599999999999
yes I am live of course I'm live

1022.579 --> 1026.72
well

1024.26 --> 1030.079
I'll call you back when I'll call you

1026.72 --> 1032.059
back now I'm having a live show and

1030.079 --> 1034.54
that's why I'm not calling you back but

1032.059 --> 1034.54
that's fine

1034.64 --> 1043.0400000000002
no it doesn't seem like they can really

1038.059 --> 1044.72
uh it's let me see sometimes it has to

1043.04 --> 1049.24
be dude

1044.72 --> 1049.24
doable to get this right I don't get it

1052.4 --> 1057.8600000000001
lonely if you send sounds like send

1055.52 --> 1059.539
system sounds it only works if you send

1057.86 --> 1062.0
system sounds in the call but I think

1059.539 --> 1064.46
you've got to call me to do it

1062.0 --> 1066.32
are you sure I don't think that really

1064.46 --> 1068.72
matters it's just picking it up through

1066.32 --> 1071.72
my microphone so

1068.72 --> 1073.1000000000001
I think I put my volume up a little so

1071.72 --> 1075.74
when you talk I think it's coming

1073.1 --> 1077.539
through better now

1075.74 --> 1079.7
so the second thing I wanted to tell you

1077.539 --> 1081.5
did you see Quantum erasers show last

1079.7 --> 1082.94
night or the other night with um the

1081.5 --> 1087.02
biologist

1082.94 --> 1088.8200000000002
no no I missed that what happened is

1087.02 --> 1092.62
that Tuesday

1088.82 --> 1095.36
uh premiered on the 30th it's entitled

1092.62 --> 1097.34
discussion QE versus the biologist the

1095.36 --> 1099.1999999999998
scientist of 35 years

1097.34 --> 1100.82
do you recognize the voice

1099.2 --> 1104.1200000000001
um well you haven't listened to it but

1100.82 --> 1105.4399999999998
it's it's miles delighted it's that

1104.12 --> 1107.7199999999998
really

1105.44 --> 1109.1000000000001
yeah honest to God it's miles to lie

1107.72 --> 1111.559
Davis I was listening to it on double

1109.1 --> 1113.059
speed and um I didn't recognize the

1111.559 --> 1115.22
voice I was listening to the words but

1113.059 --> 1116.72
his microphone was rubbish so because I

1115.22 --> 1119.24
was listening to the words not the

1116.72 --> 1121.22
dialect or the accent I didn't I didn't

1119.24 --> 1122.9
notice it but his microphone was that

1121.22 --> 1123.98
rubbish that I had to slow it down so I

1122.9 --> 1126.14
could hear what he was saying because

1123.98 --> 1127.76
his microphone was rubbish and then I

1126.14 --> 1130.7
started listening to his infections and

1127.76 --> 1132.26
his and his language and his tones and I

1130.7 --> 1134.059
realized that that's miles to Liar Davis

1132.26 --> 1135.86
and I just thought all right so he's

1134.059 --> 1139.52
reincarnated himself

1135.86 --> 1142.2199999999998
right they're migrating

1139.52 --> 1144.679
they're dropping their skin they're

1142.22 --> 1146.72
losing their skin like reptiles and just

1144.679 --> 1149.0
creating a new Avatar

1146.72 --> 1150.919
created yeah and he's presumably been

1149.0 --> 1152.78
disgraced from his old channels and he's

1150.919 --> 1155.179
about to step back from it and reinvent

1152.78 --> 1156.44
himself as another troll

1155.179 --> 1158.96
right

1156.44 --> 1161.72
yeah he never came forth with any proof

1158.96 --> 1164.72
of that molten iron core did he

1161.72 --> 1164.72
right

1167.059 --> 1172.4189999999999
he was a curved guy right

1169.94 --> 1172.419
biologist

1173.179 --> 1177.2
s get challenged this they show back

1174.74 --> 1179.66
into their hole like a snail shoveling

1177.2 --> 1182.419
back into it

1179.66 --> 1185.299
wow that's really but that's really sick

1182.419 --> 1187.8200000000002
that they would pretend to be an actual

1185.299 --> 1189.679
biologist without being one

1187.82 --> 1192.559
that's they're trying to control the

1189.679 --> 1194.179
narrative at all costs

1192.559 --> 1196.76
yeah

1194.179 --> 1199.88
but like if they go as far as to like

1196.76 --> 1201.46
like start making doctor recommendations

1199.88 --> 1204.679
and all that

1201.46 --> 1206.9
claiming that all those identity that's

1204.679 --> 1209.299
like enough that's

1206.9 --> 1213.26
what do you call that

1209.299 --> 1214.94
that's illegal even on the internet

1213.26 --> 1216.5
it's just it's just [ __ ] in the

1214.94 --> 1218.78
narrative to make it sound make make

1216.5 --> 1221.539
make their position sound stronger or

1218.78 --> 1224.66
more credible than what it actually is

1221.539 --> 1227.96
right as long as they're just saying oh

1224.66 --> 1229.64
I'm a biologist and I think that all the

1227.96 --> 1232.22
flat earthers are wrong

1229.64 --> 1234.2
well that's just standard propaganda you

1232.22 --> 1236.66
know that's nothing to stop that but as

1234.2 --> 1238.7
long as they don't get too far in

1236.66 --> 1242.539
character and start to actually do

1238.7 --> 1244.94
illegal things with that character

1242.539 --> 1246.5
yeah wow so in the last couple of days

1244.94 --> 1248.66
I've had a bit I've tried to have an

1246.5 --> 1250.039
Engaged conversation with them hillbilly

1248.66 --> 1251.24
blue balls but it's really difficult

1250.039 --> 1252.799
because um

1251.24 --> 1254.36
he never really answers any questions

1252.799 --> 1256.28
and he always distracts with stuff

1254.36 --> 1257.8999999999999
instead rather than addressing the point

1256.28 --> 1259.46
and I'm trying to have a conversation

1257.9 --> 1261.44
with him about the Cavendish experiment

1259.46 --> 1262.7
that he's trying to

1261.44 --> 1264.8600000000001
um

1262.7 --> 1266.299
and talk to the guy he he won't have a

1264.86 --> 1269.1789999999999
back and forth he'll always have a

1266.299 --> 1271.4
fragmented [ __ ] distractive nonsense

1269.179 --> 1273.2
conversation instead rather than the one

1271.4 --> 1274.64
that I want to try and have him on now

1273.2 --> 1276.919
obviously he's trying to repeat the

1274.64 --> 1278.72
Cavendish experiment right I guess he's

1276.919 --> 1282.98
trying to validate the experiment so

1278.72 --> 1285.44
he's got to do the torsion bar twist so

1282.98 --> 1287.179
um the claim is that mass attract Mass

1285.44 --> 1288.919
and obviously we know that mass doesn't

1287.179 --> 1290.8400000000001
attract Mass because Einstein said so

1288.919 --> 1292.159
and there's no there's no observed

1290.84 --> 1293.78
phenomena that indicates that it does

1292.159 --> 1295.7600000000002
because when you realize that the

1293.78 --> 1296.8999999999999
medium's got something to do with it if

1295.76 --> 1298.76
you're going to assert that there's

1296.9 --> 1299.96
something above and beyond the medium

1298.76 --> 1301.7
then you're gonna have to demonstrate it

1299.96 --> 1303.02
right and this is what they believe that

1301.7 --> 1305.539
they can demonstrate but the problem

1303.02 --> 1307.6399999999999
we've got is obviously they're kind of

1305.539 --> 1309.3799999999999
having the Reagan eating it because on

1307.64 --> 1311.1200000000001
the one hand they want Mass attractive

1309.38 --> 1313.5800000000002
Mass but on the other hand they need

1311.12 --> 1316.1
Einstein to explain the cosmology of the

1313.58 --> 1318.32
universe because new the except Newton's

1316.1 --> 1320.059
Mass isn't sufficient so they want to

1318.32 --> 1321.559
argue with Einstein when it suits them

1320.059 --> 1323.72
but they also want to argue Newton when

1321.559 --> 1324.86
it suits them depending on the mood that

1323.72 --> 1326.9
they're into and what they need to put

1324.86 --> 1330.02
what point they want to try well they're

1326.9 --> 1332.72
trying to build a two-sided Spectrum

1330.02 --> 1334.52
like Einstein gets space and the things

1332.72 --> 1338.24
that are very big and very strong and

1334.52 --> 1339.799
very out of the way and Newton gets the

1338.24 --> 1341.78
close by

1339.799 --> 1343.6399999999999
gets the Earthly

1341.78 --> 1344.74
wait is the interesting thing except

1343.64 --> 1347.1200000000001
yeah

1344.74 --> 1349.46
it's still every time this is brought up

1347.12 --> 1353.1789999999999
I think about the orbit of mercury and

1349.46 --> 1355.76
how they have to suddenly ignore Mercury

1353.179 --> 1358.46
within the Newtonian model of the solar

1355.76 --> 1361.28
system and then just fill it in oh this

1358.46 --> 1363.26
is Einstein like like they're literally

1361.28 --> 1365.299
oh this is a mall it works like this

1363.26 --> 1367.52
it's in balance force is in Balance

1365.299 --> 1372.46
except for mercury we would just have to

1367.52 --> 1372.46
draw it on there because it can't fit

1376.419 --> 1380.7800000000002
regardless of whether Einstein's right

1378.559 --> 1382.34
or not when was the last time you went

1380.78 --> 1384.32
on YouTube and started looking into the

1382.34 --> 1385.82
Cavendish like to see what's out there

1384.32 --> 1388.7
in terms of has anybody done anything

1385.82 --> 1391.9399999999998
recently on it

1388.7 --> 1394.5800000000002
recently not so much I think that during

1391.94 --> 1397.039
our discussions with about gravity

1394.58 --> 1398.72
versus relative density I think it

1397.039 --> 1400.76
during that time there was a lot of

1398.72 --> 1403.88
interest in it and also a lot of Ballers

1400.76 --> 1406.22
bring forth supposed Cavendish claims

1403.88 --> 1407.72
and all that right yeah but you

1406.22 --> 1409.94
personally when was last time you went

1407.72 --> 1413.0
and looked into it in terms of YouTube

1409.94 --> 1415.7
you know I haven't looked into it since

1413.0 --> 1419.0
then but even then I I really never

1415.7 --> 1422.48
looked into it because I've had my own

1419.0 --> 1423.919
little Cavendish confrontation way back

1422.48 --> 1426.6200000000001
in school

1423.919 --> 1428.72
like I already got to hear from people

1426.62 --> 1430.9399999999998
that were skeptical about it said like

1428.72 --> 1434.3600000000001
yeah it's not technically scientific and

1430.94 --> 1436.039
yeah it's just a test and it's kind of

1434.36 --> 1437.78
inconclusive

1436.039 --> 1439.64
right well is the thing that's

1437.78 --> 1442.94
interesting last time I looked into it

1439.64 --> 1444.2
was about 18 months ago two years ago at

1442.94 --> 1446.0
that time there was a couple of

1444.2 --> 1447.799
experiments there was the guy saying how

1446.0 --> 1449.059
difficult it is and how he has to saw it

1447.799 --> 1450.32
in half because he got that frustrated

1449.059 --> 1452.96
with it because he couldn't get it to

1450.32 --> 1454.58
work and it was basically inconclusive

1452.96 --> 1456.799
it didn't prove something it didn't it

1454.58 --> 1458.72
failed to prove anything yet it still

1456.799 --> 1460.34
believed anyway but that was 18 months

1458.72 --> 1463.28
ago when I went to do it this morning

1460.34 --> 1465.799
there's absolutely loads of so-called

1463.28 --> 1467.6589999999999
Cavendish experiment repetitions where

1465.799 --> 1470.179
they're doing it in the Sports Hall

1467.659 --> 1471.5
they're doing it in their bedrooms two

1470.179 --> 1473.8400000000001
like literally they're doing it with

1471.5 --> 1477.039
like two socks and a rag kind of thing

1473.84 --> 1478.6589999999999
it's so it's so um

1477.039 --> 1481.039
uncontrolled

1478.659 --> 1483.8600000000001
so uh what's the word I'm looking for

1481.039 --> 1485.6
like casual and trivial that anyone can

1483.86 --> 1488.7199999999998
repeat this at any any time with

1485.6 --> 1492.5
anything it's that like simple it's a

1488.72 --> 1494.72
joke they make it look so trivial that

1492.5 --> 1497.2
that you shouldn't even be questioning

1494.72 --> 1499.34
this stuff but the reality is that

1497.2 --> 1501.799
somebody's clearly flooding the market

1499.34 --> 1503.84
with repeat uh Cavendish experiments

1501.799 --> 1506.78
because repeat Cavendish experiments are

1503.84 --> 1508.76
meant to prove Summit but like it looks

1506.78 --> 1511.1
from a ball earthers perspective that's

1508.76 --> 1513.2
new to the topic it looks like they've

1511.1 --> 1514.76
just come here learned this stuff and

1513.2 --> 1516.8600000000001
seen all the experiments and then

1514.76 --> 1518.6
accepted it and never really looked into

1516.86 --> 1520.4599999999998
the critical thought about whether or

1518.6 --> 1522.6789999999999
not it's even true they just accept it

1520.46 --> 1524.48
and it's presentable it looks credible

1522.679 --> 1526.159
because it's universities that are doing

1524.48 --> 1527.72
it it's everybody they're doing it with

1526.159 --> 1529.7600000000002
yogurt pots you know what I mean they're

1527.72 --> 1531.799
making it sound like it's so easy to do

1529.76 --> 1534.3799999999999
yet when you actually try and do it

1531.799 --> 1537.26
yourself it doesn't work and we didn't

1534.38 --> 1540.6200000000001
get it to work hillbilly blue balls not

1537.26 --> 1543.98
just that not just that Tony it's also

1540.62 --> 1546.799
incredibly difficult officially to do it

1543.98 --> 1548.48
right because you gotta isolate all the

1546.799 --> 1551.98
other influences and that's almost

1548.48 --> 1555.919
impossible static influences wind

1551.98 --> 1558.559
pressure situations as like this is not

1555.919 --> 1560.6000000000001
just you put two socks on a stick

1558.559 --> 1562.36
and then you got your Cabinetry that's

1560.6 --> 1565.1
not how this works

1562.36 --> 1567.32
it's really difficult to get all the

1565.1 --> 1569.559
variables nicely this is not just a

1567.32 --> 1573.3999999999999
quick make shift do it in your garage

1569.559 --> 1573.3999999999999
experiment or test

1575.08 --> 1579.74
to make it sound or to make it look like

1577.52 --> 1582.32
on YouTube to make it look like it's so

1579.74 --> 1583.88
easy to do and that everybody should be

1582.32 --> 1585.3799999999999
able to do it so what it creates the

1583.88 --> 1586.5800000000002
perception then is that it's only flat

1585.38 --> 1588.3200000000002
earthers that have a problem with it

1586.58 --> 1590.1789999999999
everybody on our sides able to do it in

1588.32 --> 1591.98
the bedrooms it's like and then I remind

1590.179 --> 1593.779
myself of slides one remember slice

1591.98 --> 1596.539
markings one where you did the styrene

1593.779 --> 1598.039
boards alongside his bed and then made

1596.539 --> 1600.62
it look like it was working there with

1598.039 --> 1602.72
like some styrene boards that are

1600.62 --> 1604.34
obviously not part of the test that

1602.72 --> 1606.02
video doesn't seem to exist anymore it

1604.34 --> 1608.4189999999999
seems to have removed it it's

1606.02 --> 1610.1589999999999
interesting how it all seems so trivial

1608.419 --> 1612.5
and easy to do but when you actually try

1610.159 --> 1615.6200000000001
doing it it doesn't work

1612.5 --> 1618.26
right yeah when you do it right when you

1615.62 --> 1620.36
actually put in a proper setting for it

1618.26 --> 1622.22
the results are inconclusive and that's

1620.36 --> 1625.039
what I got out of it that people that

1622.22 --> 1627.919
take it really serious if a lot of them

1625.039 --> 1630.08
do it and like they'll compare like is

1627.919 --> 1631.88
this a proper setup then the results are

1630.08 --> 1634.279
inconclusive

1631.88 --> 1638.8600000000001
like they're statistically averaged out

1634.279 --> 1638.86
which definitely means inconclusive

1639.94 --> 1644.679
this sleeping Warrior character adds

1642.38 --> 1647.96
nothing to your early bird shower yeah

1644.679 --> 1650.299
yeah he needs to be a stub being a

1647.96 --> 1653.24
complaining pants here like I'm happy to

1650.299 --> 1654.98
have a guest on for once you know I'm

1653.24 --> 1657.26
happy to get on I've tried like two

1654.98 --> 1660.26
times and not gone right well it's been

1657.26 --> 1662.48
mostly because of technical sound issues

1660.26 --> 1664.22
that just really haven't tried but this

1662.48 --> 1666.559
seems to work out if I just put my

1664.22 --> 1669.02
speaker volume pretty high up then

1666.559 --> 1671.6
you're still coming through

1669.02 --> 1673.8799999999999
it seems to be working

1671.6 --> 1676.4599999999998
but yeah so there's three things there

1673.88 --> 1677.72
so Bob's been on do the politicians

1676.46 --> 1679.46
rounds where he's trying to persuade

1677.72 --> 1682.22
everybody that there's a downwards bias

1679.46 --> 1683.9
and I hillbilly blue balls and his and

1682.22 --> 1685.7
his Cavendish experiment test there's

1683.9 --> 1687.26
there's like now YouTube's flooded with

1685.7 --> 1689.059
them and he's obviously the Protege of

1687.26 --> 1690.44
it he's the result of it so he's

1689.059 --> 1692.36
obviously seen how easy it is and he

1690.44 --> 1694.4
thought he's going to do it himself and

1692.36 --> 1697.34
the other one was uh marthalaya Davis

1694.4 --> 1699.679
was passing himself off as a 25-year

1697.34 --> 1702.9399999999998
serving biologist uh scientist that

1699.679 --> 1702.94
didn't know scientific method

1703.159 --> 1710.2990000000002
God did somebody ask him did somebody

1706.159 --> 1711.679
ask him so what exactly was your uh

1710.299 --> 1715.039
what do you call that

1711.679 --> 1717.98
like your graduation project it has a

1715.039 --> 1721.1
special name like in universities like

1717.98 --> 1723.88
this is yeah somebody should have had

1721.1 --> 1726.9189999999999
like what what was your thesis in school

1723.88 --> 1729.38
Mr 25 year biologist what did you do

1726.919 --> 1732.26
exactly could you can you describe it

1729.38 --> 1734.179
roughly yeah if he's not a biologist

1732.26 --> 1736.279
that there's no way you can think up

1734.179 --> 1737.3600000000001
something that like that yeah you never

1736.279 --> 1738.559
get a straight something around Miles

1737.36 --> 1739.76
because like no I don't think any of

1738.559 --> 1740.8999999999999
them are telling the truth I think that

1739.76 --> 1742.46
they're all coming back on Phoenix

1740.9 --> 1743.8400000000001
accounts when they get Sean to be a

1742.46 --> 1745.279
little bit a little bit stupid and

1743.84 --> 1747.02
rather than admit that they got

1745.279 --> 1750.34
something wrong they'll just reinvent

1747.02 --> 1750.34
themselves as another soccer count

1751.84 --> 1756.9189999999999
but it's pretty sad that they would

1754.159 --> 1759.0200000000002
stoop to that level of like completely

1756.919 --> 1761.779
forging

1759.02 --> 1763.039
credit like background credit and

1761.779 --> 1765.38
studies

1763.039 --> 1767.559
Bob and the boom boom talk shout out to

1765.38 --> 1767.5590000000002
iron

1769.659 --> 1773.8400000000001
as he retracted his statements about gas

1772.399 --> 1775.8799999999999
pressure go down the gold boom boom yeah

1773.84 --> 1776.72
or is he still left that out there what

1775.88 --> 1779.3600000000001
who

1776.72 --> 1780.679
Bob Bob was he retracted that yeah or is

1779.36 --> 1783.9189999999999
he still saying that gas pressure goes

1780.679 --> 1785.5
down oh no he absolutely well

1783.919 --> 1788.0590000000002
yes

1785.5 --> 1791.059
but he said it literally you know he

1788.059 --> 1793.58
said it in response to Nathan like gas

1791.059 --> 1795.62
in fact does go down go boom boom I

1793.58 --> 1797.5
don't know I I haven't heard him retract

1795.62 --> 1800.36
anything

1797.5 --> 1804.44
when does Bob freaking retract anything

1800.36 --> 1806.4799999999998
you know he rarely does especially if

1804.44 --> 1808.3990000000001
it's about something an opponent in a

1806.48 --> 1811.3990000000001
virtual to him opponent says something

1808.399 --> 1812.6
he never attracts [ __ ]

1811.399 --> 1816.1399999999999
so

1812.6 --> 1818.059
he just said that like oh no there is a

1816.14 --> 1820.46
way in which you can conceive that gas

1818.059 --> 1821.72
will go down go boom boom and he just

1820.46 --> 1823.82
yeah

1821.72 --> 1825.98
he put that out and he's still backing

1823.82 --> 1828.799
it so he's just convinced there as a

1825.98 --> 1832.279
downward bias

1828.799 --> 1834.3799999999999
an overlaying force that is the cause of

1832.279 --> 1837.38
the relative density alignment and

1834.38 --> 1840.7
relative densities just not enough

1837.38 --> 1840.7
he needs more

1840.74 --> 1844.22
so we can demonstrate that right if he

1842.6 --> 1846.1399999999999
thinks that it's insufficient and

1844.22 --> 1849.159
there's a little bit extra he could test

1846.14 --> 1849.159
it with a demonstration

1854.899 --> 1858.1999999999998
we'll make it do that and that proves

1856.82 --> 1860.84
that it's correlative and it's not

1858.2 --> 1862.279
causative so there's more to it and I I

1860.84 --> 1864.86
mean listen I've tried to do that egg

1862.279 --> 1866.899
test but with electricity I've used a

1864.86 --> 1869.0
car battery a van battery to pass a

1866.899 --> 1871.039
current through the water to try and get

1869.0 --> 1872.779
the egg to move now it does start the

1871.039 --> 1874.399
electrolysis process but if you just

1872.779 --> 1876.62
touch it and then let it go touch it and

1874.399 --> 1878.299
then let it go the egg should be the egg

1876.62 --> 1880.58
should move it should jolt but it

1878.299 --> 1882.26
doesn't move so I couldn't get it to

1880.58 --> 1883.6999999999998
work and I've tried to get them to

1882.26 --> 1885.26
repeat it to demonstrate that something

1883.7 --> 1887.48
with real world in there should not a

1885.26 --> 1889.7
Fleck of paint it's a little bit weak

1887.48 --> 1892.64
and something with real world inertia if

1889.7 --> 1894.6200000000001
you can get that to move then maybe but

1892.64 --> 1896.6000000000001
I couldn't get it to do it but it won't

1894.62 --> 1898.279
even try and it's because it's not

1896.6 --> 1899.9599999999998
because it won't I think it's because he

1898.279 --> 1900.74
knows that if he does it it'll not do

1899.96 --> 1902.8990000000001
anything

1900.74 --> 1905.24
so therefore it limits his argument to

1902.899 --> 1908.3799999999999
yeah it might affect Flex of paint but

1905.24 --> 1908.38
it doesn't affect anything else

1908.779 --> 1915.02
right well you know that the whole

1912.44 --> 1917.8400000000001
dielectric situation I've already like

1915.02 --> 1920.24
tried to explain it even on my show here

1917.84 --> 1922.6399999999999
that the idea is

1920.24 --> 1925.159
interesting but yeah you gotta get real

1922.64 --> 1928.279
with the scale of the realm we're in

1925.159 --> 1931.3990000000001
so every time you think something is the

1928.279 --> 1933.14
cause of something in the realm and you

1931.399 --> 1936.9799999999998
can create some kind of miniature

1933.14 --> 1939.6200000000001
situation to to hint at that how that

1936.98 --> 1942.02
would be well it's very simple scale it

1939.62 --> 1944.1789999999999
up then and then let's see if the

1942.02 --> 1946.039
energies that are required for that to

1944.179 --> 1950.419
be real are out there

1946.039 --> 1953.84
and yeah it's useless there is no such

1950.419 --> 1955.94
energy out there that is palpable and in

1953.84 --> 1957.26
effect constantly we would notice we

1955.94 --> 1958.64
would pick it up

1957.26 --> 1962.299
there would be all kinds of weird

1958.64 --> 1964.5200000000002
consequences I think yeah thunderstorms

1962.299 --> 1966.02
would show like things that would be

1964.52 --> 1967.76
invert in polarity because like

1966.02 --> 1970.279
thunderstorms are electrical by Nature

1967.76 --> 1972.02
there's a lot of charge be it positive

1970.279 --> 1973.7
or negative there's a lot of change in

1972.02 --> 1976.039
charge at that time and there's an

1973.7 --> 1978.14
electrical storm you would expect to see

1976.039 --> 1981.1
things that would be on the floor rising

1978.14 --> 1983.72
to the sky right something something

1981.1 --> 1986.9599999999998
gets struck by lightning and then it

1983.72 --> 1989.6000000000001
like just Falls up

1986.96 --> 1991.3990000000001
I could get sucks up as the

1989.6 --> 1993.5
thunderclouds are moving in you'd expect

1991.399 --> 1995.36
to see plastic carrier bags start

1993.5 --> 1996.679
literally Rising into the sky because

1995.36 --> 1999.1399999999999
they're being attracted towards an

1996.679 --> 2000.64
apparent Force because the polarity is

1999.14 --> 2002.0800000000002
inverted because there's a lot of charge

2000.64 --> 2004.3600000000001
potential now because there's a big

2002.08 --> 2006.46
massive Cloud full of static or full of

2004.36 --> 2008.4399999999998
charge potential and we don't see

2006.46 --> 2009.88
anything like that nothing so it's like

2008.44 --> 2011.679
making the claim that there's something

2009.88 --> 2013.1200000000001
there that you can't describe that we

2011.679 --> 2014.74
don't see evidence of what sounds

2013.12 --> 2017.7399999999998
logical and it sounds as though it

2014.74 --> 2019.299
sounds a bit like narnia-esque that

2017.74 --> 2021.46
sounds okay that right but can you

2019.299 --> 2024.7
demonstrate it no can we see it anywhere

2021.46 --> 2026.44
no can you calculate it no but I can

2024.7 --> 2028.96
draw your diagram all right okay that's

2026.44 --> 2032.26
okay then right or try to demonstrate

2028.96 --> 2034.6000000000001
some man-made device based setup and

2032.26 --> 2037.6
then just point at certain elements of

2034.6 --> 2039.279
it and not the entirety right

2037.6 --> 2041.1399999999999
I mean I think I think most people

2039.279 --> 2044.019
accept that there is

2041.14 --> 2046.419
electricity excuse me there is

2044.019 --> 2048.76
electricity in some way be it like

2046.419 --> 2051.52
charge potential or static or voltage

2048.76 --> 2054.5800000000004
there is voltage around us in some way

2051.52 --> 2056.74
but the issue is what does it do in the

2054.58 --> 2059.3199999999997
context of acceleration and up and down

2056.74 --> 2061.06
or density or whatever and the answer is

2059.32 --> 2062.7400000000002
well it doesn't seem to do anything so

2061.06 --> 2064.839
why is certain people pushing it on our

2062.74 --> 2066.52
side I don't know well I don't get why

2064.839 --> 2069.22
they would push it because it's against

2066.52 --> 2073.08
everything that's like scientific where

2069.22 --> 2073.08
do we see it we don't okay it stops

2073.119 --> 2077.9190000000003
yeah it's not good

2075.159 --> 2080.859
well I I wonder why it is too you know

2077.919 --> 2083.2
maybe it is because

2080.859 --> 2085.48
I said I wonder sometimes if it is

2083.2 --> 2089.6189999999997
considered

2085.48 --> 2092.379
as a thing that they want to do because

2089.619 --> 2095.619
then instead of saying yeah it's just

2092.379 --> 2097.18
this and that's all we know they want to

2095.619 --> 2100.3
take away

2097.18 --> 2102.16
the fantasizing room from the ballers in

2100.3 --> 2104.8
response to that that will say but look

2102.16 --> 2106.359
our model has so much more explanation

2104.8 --> 2108.5800000000004
beyond that

2106.359 --> 2112.54
and so they want to just fill it in like

2108.58 --> 2115.24
no it's not that this is our just so

2112.54 --> 2118.42
story why did you latch on to that

2115.24 --> 2119.74
and maybe it's it's it's as primitive as

2118.42 --> 2121.839
that

2119.74 --> 2125.3199999999997
they just want to hand something for

2121.839 --> 2128.14
others to latch onto in order to move to

2125.32 --> 2129.76
their side but that doesn't help the

2128.14 --> 2131.92
critical thinking process you know

2129.76 --> 2133.6600000000003
because that's what in my opinion this

2131.92 --> 2136.42
is all about the entire flatter

2133.66 --> 2138.7599999999998
situation and everything it's all about

2136.42 --> 2141.099
critical thinking and about not getting

2138.76 --> 2143.26
caught up in stories but always testing

2141.099 --> 2145.54
them and also realizing the more you

2143.26 --> 2147.94
know the more you realize

2145.54 --> 2150.04
that there's a lot you don't know and

2147.94 --> 2152.56
that you have been filled in with

2150.04 --> 2156.4
[ __ ] stories that you need to let go

2152.56 --> 2159.339
of and that's painful you know knowing a

2156.4 --> 2161.14
lot is painful because then you know how

2159.339 --> 2163.599
much bullshit's really there and you

2161.14 --> 2167.7999999999997
know why it is [ __ ]

2163.599 --> 2170.1400000000003
and then yeah what do you do

2167.8 --> 2171.7000000000003
when you've been looking into I've been

2170.14 --> 2173.14
looking into remember the Cartesian

2171.7 --> 2174.8199999999997
diver

2173.14 --> 2177.04
no

2174.82 --> 2178.54
what the cart easy divers basically

2177.04 --> 2180.88
anything that's got an air bubble inside

2178.54 --> 2182.56
of it so like if you get a bottle of pop

2180.88 --> 2184.42
and you fill it half up and then put the

2182.56 --> 2186.88
lid on you can then put the bottle of

2184.42 --> 2188.92
Pop inside another bottle and then

2186.88 --> 2191.6800000000003
squeeze the outside bottle to create

2188.92 --> 2193.3
more pressure on the inside and then the

2191.68 --> 2195.3999999999996
bottle the little bottle that you put

2193.3 --> 2197.38
inside will move up and down because you

2195.4 --> 2200.32
can press

2197.38 --> 2201.76
the little wow and you're reducing the

2200.32 --> 2204.099
amount of um

2201.76 --> 2205.599
you're keeping the volume the same but

2204.099 --> 2208.3
you can press in the gas that's inside

2205.599 --> 2209.44
it so the volume changes inside so what

2208.3 --> 2211.54
you're doing there is you're directly

2209.44 --> 2213.16
manipulating the relative density of the

2211.54 --> 2214.7799999999997
object so you're keeping the mass the

2213.16 --> 2216.7599999999998
same but you're altering the size the

2214.78 --> 2220.0
volume of the mass the gas that's inside

2216.76 --> 2222.099
it you're squashing it right I remember

2220.0 --> 2223.839
yeah so it makes these things and it's

2222.099 --> 2225.76
very counter-intuitive when you see it

2223.839 --> 2227.859
happen because somebody squeezes

2225.76 --> 2229.96
something and it and it goes down and

2227.859 --> 2232.06
then you unsqueeze it by letting go and

2229.96 --> 2233.5
it goes back up and then you look at it

2232.06 --> 2235.119
and go what's the explanation for that

2233.5 --> 2236.92
but if you understand relative density

2235.119 --> 2238.599
it's very obvious when it's pointed out

2236.92 --> 2240.099
that you change you're keeping the mass

2238.599 --> 2243.28
the same but you're making the the

2240.099 --> 2245.079
volume smaller and because of that it

2243.28 --> 2246.82
means that you're changing the relative

2245.079 --> 2249.04
density of this equilibrium and that's

2246.82 --> 2250.3590000000004
why the acceleration occurs yeah we're

2249.04 --> 2252.46
going to try and put together a video

2250.359 --> 2254.619
showing Cartesian divers in different

2252.46 --> 2256.96
kinds and show that it's obviously to do

2254.619 --> 2258.76
with the volume and the mass relative to

2256.96 --> 2260.92
the median and that's where we get the

2258.76 --> 2263.0200000000004
acceleration from but no one ever looks

2260.92 --> 2264.94
at the Cartesian diver and goes yeah

2263.02 --> 2266.44
that debunks gravity you just look at it

2264.94 --> 2268.2400000000002
and go yeah that's a cool bit of science

2266.44 --> 2269.8
that you know it's really good that we

2268.24 --> 2271.66
do these kid things but what did we

2269.8 --> 2273.76
actually show by it and obviously we

2271.66 --> 2275.2
don't show anything by it it's like they

2273.76 --> 2277.3
tell us don't look over here for the

2275.2 --> 2279.04
real Signs by the way look over here

2277.3 --> 2280.8390000000004
there's a bit of gravity and they want

2279.04 --> 2282.64
you to look at this the magic of gravity

2280.839 --> 2284.68
instead of the real world science of the

2282.64 --> 2286.5989999999997
Cartesian diver experiments which do

2284.68 --> 2288.64
show why things accelerate and it's

2286.599 --> 2290.8590000000004
because of relative density

2288.64 --> 2293.859
yeah well that's the problem isn't it

2290.859 --> 2296.74
with the wider audience that scientism

2293.859 --> 2298.44
basically directs itself towards is just

2296.74 --> 2301.839
saying look

2298.44 --> 2304.54
seeing things happening

2301.839 --> 2306.7599999999998
is science

2304.54 --> 2309.2799999999997
literally that's that's been the message

2306.76 --> 2311.8590000000004
for like 20 years in the science

2309.28 --> 2314.1400000000003
Community just seeing things happening

2311.859 --> 2317.16
is science

2314.14 --> 2320.92
right and that's all you don't have to

2317.16 --> 2323.2599999999998
like draw in anything that is like

2320.92 --> 2326.38
provable based on physics or no it's

2323.26 --> 2329.92
just doing little thingies like ooh

2326.38 --> 2332.079
making fomo look old this or that

2329.92 --> 2335.56
some movement of something and that's

2332.079 --> 2337.3
science according to well the priesthood

2335.56 --> 2339.339
out there

2337.3 --> 2341.6800000000003
so they think they're observing

2339.339 --> 2343.2999999999997
something is Saints that's why they

2341.68 --> 2344.6189999999997
think astrophysics is science because

2343.3 --> 2346.9
they're observing stuff and they're

2344.619 --> 2349.06
interpreting what they're looking at but

2346.9 --> 2351.04
if You observe the sunrise and you

2349.06 --> 2353.2599999999998
notice that the Cockrell is cockadoodle

2351.04 --> 2354.7599999999998
doing every day and you think that the

2353.26 --> 2356.38
cockadoodle do is causing Sunrise

2354.76 --> 2357.94
because every single day the cockadoodle

2356.38 --> 2360.28
do comes and then the sun comes up right

2357.94 --> 2362.26
but then that's correlative and that's

2360.28 --> 2364.3
observation based you've got to go down

2362.26 --> 2365.5600000000004
and manipulate that variable right

2364.3 --> 2367.3
you've got to go down and kill the bird

2365.56 --> 2368.74
and then the sun still comes up and then

2367.3 --> 2369.94
you realize that it wasn't the bird that

2368.74 --> 2372.4599999999996
was causing it even though it looked

2369.94 --> 2373.96
that way that's the best example that I

2372.46 --> 2378.0
can give for correlation not being

2373.96 --> 2378.0
causation and they do it all the time

2378.339 --> 2382.7799999999997
right

2379.48 --> 2384.76
yeah they don't test anymore they're

2382.78 --> 2387.099
just like oh see something happening and

2384.76 --> 2390.82
then you can predict how something will

2387.099 --> 2393.76
happen or rather if you do that it will

2390.82 --> 2396.339
happen but they don't really make you

2393.76 --> 2397.42
figure out like what is actually causing

2396.339 --> 2400.18
it

2397.42 --> 2403.1800000000003
and then empirically testing it and

2400.18 --> 2406.1189999999997
isolating it they never really go there

2403.18 --> 2408.94
anymore like they do in physics studies

2406.119 --> 2411.88
in Practical studies of that in

2408.94 --> 2413.32
universities I take it but in general

2411.88 --> 2417.339
nope

2413.32 --> 2419.2000000000003
just see something happening and then if

2417.339 --> 2421.54
you can recreate that something

2419.2 --> 2423.9399999999996
happening in other conditions then

2421.54 --> 2425.7
you've got something

2423.94 --> 2430.5
science

2425.7 --> 2430.5
shout out to Amanda Jung oh yeah yeah

2431.619 --> 2435.94
a little talking about Sciences it's

2433.96 --> 2437.5
like it's like the buzzword in it if you

2435.94 --> 2440.8
can drop the word science into a

2437.5 --> 2442.599
conversation and push it positively

2440.8 --> 2444.6400000000003
you come across as intelligent because

2442.599 --> 2446.98
science yeah there's like an allurement

2444.64 --> 2449.0789999999997
to the word science isn't it makes you

2446.98 --> 2450.88
sound until it's sophistry it's use of

2449.079 --> 2452.5600000000004
the use of sophistry to make you sound

2450.88 --> 2456.52
intelligent by dropping science into

2452.56 --> 2456.52
stuff yeah indeed

2457.96 --> 2463.119
so yeah

2459.82 --> 2465.28
thanks for uh for coming on I like that

2463.119 --> 2467.32
I take it you're gonna join the Flat

2465.28 --> 2469.42
Earth debate

2467.32 --> 2471.88
two yeah I should do I should be in a

2469.42 --> 2473.38
bit right I'm gonna go make a coffee I

2471.88 --> 2474.88
just wanted to let you know what Bob

2473.38 --> 2477.52
doing the politicians around trying to

2474.88 --> 2479.859
get his uh is is his sales path to go in

2477.52 --> 2482.44
shout out to Bob yeah no he's he's

2479.859 --> 2485.0789999999997
trying to go around his political rounds

2482.44 --> 2487.42
and making allies everywhere like he'll

2485.079 --> 2489.2200000000003
even entertain Ballers for this

2487.42 --> 2490.9
so yeah

2489.22 --> 2492.0989999999997
I don't get it no I don't know what his

2490.9 --> 2493.96
motive is because like we don't even

2492.099 --> 2495.46
need this downward bias thing that he's

2493.96 --> 2497.38
talking about they definitely need it

2495.46 --> 2498.88
but we don't need it it might be good it

2497.38 --> 2501.04
might not be it doesn't matter to us if

2498.88 --> 2502.48
it is but he definitely they definitely

2501.04 --> 2504.88
do need it it's like what are you doing

2502.48 --> 2507.28
let them argue your point for for them

2504.88 --> 2509.6800000000003
it's not you argue that their point for

2507.28 --> 2514.119
them that's silly

2509.68 --> 2517.839
no I don't think look yeah

2514.119 --> 2519.82
what can I say about it technically deep

2517.839 --> 2522.7599999999998
deep down I don't think it's even about

2519.82 --> 2526.119
this incoherent dielectric Theory it's

2522.76 --> 2528.46
just about Nathan Oakley and crew and

2526.119 --> 2531.1600000000003
the way we do things and the critical

2528.46 --> 2533.32
thinking we are actually

2531.16 --> 2537.339
helping people reinforce within

2533.32 --> 2541.48
themselves and getting old-fashioned and

2537.339 --> 2543.22
Bob really doesn't like that he really

2541.48 --> 2546.339
doesn't and that's what it's all about

2543.22 --> 2548.68
so now it happens to be the dielectric

2546.339 --> 2550.06
Theory but with the ether it's going to

2548.68 --> 2551.74
be just the same

2550.06 --> 2555.2799999999997
he's just

2551.74 --> 2557.2599999999998
he feels like we're trapping him and his

2555.28 --> 2559.2400000000002
exploits

2557.26 --> 2562.1400000000003
with being rigid about the scientific

2559.24 --> 2562.14
method and all that

2563.859 --> 2567.5789999999997
you'll be able to display it for the

2565.359 --> 2569.68
audience maybe that depends on the

2567.579 --> 2571.78
picture

2569.68 --> 2573.46
and well you know what Bob says like

2571.78 --> 2576.099
there's still something that's dictating

2573.46 --> 2578.8
up from down yeah

2576.099 --> 2580.7200000000003
okay let me send you this you can get

2578.8 --> 2583.619
this on screen chat

2580.72 --> 2583.6189999999997
paste

2589.06 --> 2593.2599999999998
what what's that

2591.64 --> 2595.359
it's a fish tank with a lot of different

2593.26 --> 2598.5400000000004
stuff in it a lot of like individual

2595.359 --> 2600.04
unique items and Bob says that there is

2598.54 --> 2602.2599999999998
so there's definitely something that's

2600.04 --> 2604.9
separating up from down

2602.26 --> 2606.7000000000003
in in that picture what's the answer to

2604.9 --> 2608.619
that question or the statement he makes

2606.7 --> 2611.8799999999997
like what is the thing that's separating

2608.619 --> 2611.88
up from down in that picture

2612.099 --> 2617.2000000000003
gravity

2615.099 --> 2619.42
then that's the density can you get it

2617.2 --> 2623.819
on screen so they can see it uh I don't

2619.42 --> 2623.819
know for sure let me try something

2625.359 --> 2631.2999999999997
I might have to add

2628.96 --> 2634.079
picture for that

2631.3 --> 2634.079
hold on

2634.18 --> 2636.8799999999997
I think this picture's worth a thousand

2635.92 --> 2638.26
words

2636.88 --> 2640.599
um and they're all

2638.26 --> 2642.76
encapsulating they're all encompassing

2640.599 --> 2644.5
it's like what if if one pitch is worth

2642.76 --> 2647.3390000000004
a thousand words this is worth the whole

2644.5 --> 2647.339
topic of gravity

2649.78 --> 2655.3
oh dear hold on

2653.079 --> 2657.099
I know you're looking to try and get get

2655.3 --> 2659.319
assorted

2657.099 --> 2661.599
um basically imagine a fish tank half

2659.319 --> 2663.4
filled with water and on the bottom of

2661.599 --> 2666.4
the fish tank there's a load of stuff

2663.4 --> 2668.02
all individual stuff like litter and on

2666.4 --> 2669.099
the top of the water floating there's a

2668.02 --> 2671.2
lot of other stuff

2669.099 --> 2673.42
and it's the separation between the two

2671.2 --> 2676.1189999999997
now Bob says that there's definitely

2673.42 --> 2678.4
something that's separating up from down

2676.119 --> 2681.46
well we're in the medium of air and this

2678.4 --> 2684.88
is in the medium of water what do we

2681.46 --> 2686.92
think the separating factor is and if we

2684.88 --> 2691.42
were to manipulate that and change it

2686.92 --> 2694.1800000000003
from water to say salty water or less

2691.42 --> 2696.7000000000003
dense water or more dense fluids like I

2694.18 --> 2698.44
don't know like I don't know what what

2696.7 --> 2700.0
other what other liquids are there

2698.44 --> 2701.7400000000002
what's the least dense liquid I don't

2700.0 --> 2703.3
know I want to look it up all right but

2701.74 --> 2704.68
we can manipulate these things and show

2703.3 --> 2706.8390000000004
that that's the thing that's causing the

2704.68 --> 2709.0
separation okay I'm showing the picture

2706.839 --> 2712.06
right now it's not framed they're very

2709.0 --> 2713.8
nice but here you go

2712.06 --> 2715.839
yeah so essentially what we're looking

2713.8 --> 2716.7400000000002
at there is

2715.839 --> 2718.72
um

2716.74 --> 2720.9399999999996
a fish tank full of water half full of

2718.72 --> 2723.0989999999997
water and we've got something that seems

2720.94 --> 2725.5
to be separating up from down in the

2723.099 --> 2728.56
context of this picture right Bob would

2725.5 --> 2730.839
say yeah the summit that goes beyond a

2728.56 --> 2732.339
little bit further than than the meat

2730.839 --> 2734.92
the medium itself the relative density

2732.339 --> 2736.599
but I think this one picture is all you

2734.92 --> 2738.4
need to know once you understand that

2736.599 --> 2740.319
the medium is influencing up from down

2738.4 --> 2741.94
and the more you've changed around with

2740.319 --> 2743.2599999999998
that Medium you cause the acceleration

2741.94 --> 2746.02
and everything that's got on magnitude

2743.26 --> 2747.28
relative to that Medium then I don't see

2746.02 --> 2749.68
how you need anything more than that one

2747.28 --> 2751.6600000000003
picture what do you think

2749.68 --> 2753.94
I think you're right

2751.66 --> 2757.8999999999996
but yeah so much can be explained

2753.94 --> 2761.7400000000002
through basic relative density you know

2757.9 --> 2765.04
that this relative density overall has

2761.74 --> 2767.9199999999996
such fast Dynamics when you utilize it

2765.04 --> 2769.839
in a setup scenario if you try to figure

2767.92 --> 2772.42
out like okay what you're gonna have

2769.839 --> 2774.339
stuff What's it gonna do

2772.42 --> 2776.5
you know there's so much you can do with

2774.339 --> 2778.66
relative density

2776.5 --> 2780.52
and when you compare the other

2778.66 --> 2784.42
Frameworks

2780.52 --> 2786.7599999999998
there's a lot less you can do with that

2784.42 --> 2788.2000000000003
it's always very limited over the

2786.76 --> 2790.42
relative density you could pretty much

2788.2 --> 2792.7
explain while literally everything just

2790.42 --> 2794.7400000000002
everything everything you see everything

2792.7 --> 2797.2599999999998
you've ever seen

2794.74 --> 2799.359
it could be sketched out exactly what is

2797.26 --> 2801.76
the density situation where is its

2799.359 --> 2804.7599999999998
equilibrium why is it why is the boat

2801.76 --> 2807.28
resting on that level why is the balloon

2804.76 --> 2809.079
floating up until that point

2807.28 --> 2811.3590000000004
etc etc

2809.079 --> 2812.8590000000004
so if you look at that picture look I

2811.359 --> 2814.42
don't know what the most dense object in

2812.859 --> 2816.4
there is but I would say it's probably

2814.42 --> 2819.339
the tin the tin of soup in the back left

2816.4 --> 2821.56
hand corner and the least dense in the

2819.339 --> 2823.599
in in the stuff that's in the water will

2821.56 --> 2824.98
probably be that square I'm not sure

2823.599 --> 2826.7200000000003
what the square is but it looks like it

2824.98 --> 2827.8
might be some kind of saturated sponge

2826.72 --> 2829.839
or whatever

2827.8 --> 2830.8590000000004
but if you were to add salt to that

2829.839 --> 2833.56
water

2830.859 --> 2835.359
nothing in there as the salt's dissolved

2833.56 --> 2837.5789999999997
in and it's just Square the salt's more

2835.359 --> 2840.16
dense there's something in that water

2837.579 --> 2841.599
that would start to move first the first

2840.16 --> 2844.18
thing that would start to move would be

2841.599 --> 2845.5
the least dense but obviously if you

2844.18 --> 2847.54
have to have a set of scales in there

2845.5 --> 2849.099
before you put the salt in they'd all

2847.54 --> 2850.7799999999997
have a relative weight wouldn't they'd

2849.099 --> 2852.2200000000003
have a relative weight in that Medium

2850.78 --> 2852.88
but then actually started adding the

2852.22 --> 2854.74
salt

2852.88 --> 2856.3
relative weight would change and

2854.74 --> 2857.7999999999997
eventually it would become a negative

2856.3 --> 2859.54
value because that's where your the

2857.8 --> 2862.78
direction comes from the changing the

2859.54 --> 2864.339
density of the medium right so not only

2862.78 --> 2866.079
does it show that relative weight is

2864.339 --> 2869.0789999999997
relative and it shows the direction

2866.079 --> 2870.7000000000003
that's caused from down it's something

2869.079 --> 2873.46
it's the only thing that we can really

2870.7 --> 2875.319
demonstrate that is scientific

2873.46 --> 2877.48
yeah right Bob doesn't think that this

2875.319 --> 2879.52
goes far enough I only thinks that the

2877.48 --> 2880.3
icing on the cake or the sprinkles on

2879.52 --> 2882.28
the top

2880.3 --> 2883.7200000000003
is the thing that causes everything to

2882.28 --> 2885.7000000000003
have the separation from up from down

2883.72 --> 2888.8799999999997
even though we see that there

2885.7 --> 2891.22
right I just wish it'd be a little bit

2888.88 --> 2895.359
more honest

2891.22 --> 2897.819
well he just wants to Dream On about the

2895.359 --> 2899.74
thing that is Out Of Reach

2897.819 --> 2901.54
you know gravity is an aberration I

2899.74 --> 2903.7
called it years ago

2901.54 --> 2905.8
in separation because it's very

2903.7 --> 2908.859
appealing you're always going to stumble

2905.8 --> 2911.3390000000004
upon it and it will never yield actual

2908.859 --> 2914.38
evidence despite all the suggestions

2911.339 --> 2918.96
that it can entails

2914.38 --> 2918.96
and yeah so you can basically get

2919.24 --> 2925.359
per go in pursuit of gravity the

2922.3 --> 2927.099
aberration the rest of your life and you

2925.359 --> 2930.0989999999997
yeah you'll figure out all kinds of

2927.099 --> 2932.92
things but you'll never prove it though

2930.099 --> 2935.8590000000004
right now relative density just solves

2932.92 --> 2937.96
that but you have to let it go you just

2935.859 --> 2940.119
have to let it go like yeah you you

2937.96 --> 2945.2200000000003
don't get an answer as to the alignment

2940.119 --> 2947.38
of the this equilibrium force and it's

2945.22 --> 2948.8799999999997
just the way it is set up and that is

2947.38 --> 2952.6600000000003
the way it works

2948.88 --> 2954.819
there is no further data

2952.66 --> 2957.7
really you just said then you don't get

2954.819 --> 2960.4
an answer to the the force the alignment

2957.7 --> 2962.6189999999997
Force you do the thing that's causing

2960.4 --> 2964.6600000000003
these things to move is the pressure as

2962.619 --> 2966.76
you're adding more mass into that water

2964.66 --> 2968.0789999999997
you're adding more pressure lowering the

2966.76 --> 2970.3590000000004
thing because you're using the salt to

2968.079 --> 2972.76
do it you're adding you're creating a

2970.359 --> 2975.46
density grade no because that's not what

2972.76 --> 2977.8590000000004
I mean though it's not like why does the

2975.46 --> 2979.78
disequilibrium force start to go into

2977.859 --> 2981.339
effect no of course that's very obvious

2979.78 --> 2984.099
that's what the relative density theory

2981.339 --> 2986.5
is about I'm talking about why these

2984.099 --> 2989.8
specific directions right the alignment

2986.5 --> 2991.599
of this equilibrium why that that's just

2989.8 --> 2993.76
not gonna have an answer

2991.599 --> 2995.8
because it's it's just like this it's

2993.76 --> 2999.0400000000004
not going to change

2995.8 --> 3001.619
and for yeah for the foreseeable future

2999.04 --> 3003.359
it's always going to be like that

3001.619 --> 3005.28
so nothing is going to change how

3003.359 --> 3007.38
relative density works

3005.28 --> 3009.7200000000003
and there's just no answer

3007.38 --> 3010.98
to the alignment why why are these

3009.72 --> 3013.68
directions

3010.98 --> 3016.14
and there's no change in it

3013.68 --> 3019.2
so honey Womble says is buoyancy a dirty

3016.14 --> 3021.2999999999997
word well yeah because the Maths for the

3019.2 --> 3023.64
buoyancy equation you can see that the

3021.3 --> 3025.8590000000004
the little G that's in there is the

3023.64 --> 3027.48
acceleration due to gravity and we know

3025.859 --> 3029.2799999999997
according to Einstein that gravity is

3027.48 --> 3031.56
not a force it doesn't act on matter it

3029.28 --> 3033.2400000000002
can't cause things to accelerate so

3031.56 --> 3034.52
buoyancy can't be

3033.24 --> 3037.0789999999997
um

3034.52 --> 3041.839
term to use because it's got G in the

3037.079 --> 3041.8390000000004
maths so yes it has to be a dirty word

3042.119 --> 3048.0
maybe I think that

3045.18 --> 3052.04
boy look the thing is buoyancy does kind

3048.0 --> 3056.76
of explain it like buoyancy is just the

3052.04 --> 3059.7
yeah the lower density going up

3056.76 --> 3062.2200000000003
effect described within a gravity

3059.7 --> 3063.96
assuming framework so it's pretty much

3062.22 --> 3066.66
the same that's why they all call it

3063.96 --> 3068.7
specific gravity relative density but it

3066.66 --> 3071.54
it's just they turn the roles around

3068.7 --> 3075.48
they start assuming there is this

3071.54 --> 3077.7599999999998
Universal Force bias Direction and then

3075.48 --> 3080.04
they fill in what's actually happening

3077.76 --> 3083.3
but that thing that's actually happening

3080.04 --> 3086.7599999999998
doesn't really need

3083.3 --> 3090.1400000000003
that bias that one directional Force to

3086.76 --> 3093.6600000000003
exist it's just that you can assume it

3090.14 --> 3096.0589999999997
within that it's it fits the framework

3093.66 --> 3097.98
but it doesn't need to be there in order

3096.059 --> 3101.9
for it to work

3097.98 --> 3101.9
you can just fill in relative density

3102.0 --> 3106.68
yeah I agree the word buoyancy is loaded

3105.3 --> 3109.2000000000003
though you can't use the word buoyancy

3106.68 --> 3111.54
you need an alternative word so all I

3109.2 --> 3113.8799999999997
say to get around the implication of

3111.54 --> 3115.2
gravity being in the maths I just say

3113.88 --> 3117.2400000000002
it's less dense

3115.2 --> 3118.859
because that's the direction less dense

3117.24 --> 3121.5
because everyone says oh it's up and

3118.859 --> 3122.64
down buoyancy density well if you remove

3121.5 --> 3124.38
up and down from it because they're

3122.64 --> 3126.5989999999997
relative directions and you remove grout

3124.38 --> 3128.94
and density buoyancy or gravity and

3126.599 --> 3130.319
buoyancy then what are you left with and

3128.94 --> 3132.54
the only thing that we're manipulating

3130.319 --> 3134.88
is the density of one compared to the

3132.54 --> 3136.68
density of others so more dense and less

3134.88 --> 3138.1400000000003
dense and that is the direction that's

3136.68 --> 3140.52
why all right

3138.14 --> 3144.0
it's difficult because buoyancy

3140.52 --> 3147.78
technically is a description

3144.0 --> 3149.64
of an action like it's buoyant it floats

3147.78 --> 3151.2000000000003
to the top right so it's a much more

3149.64 --> 3152.5989999999997
descriptive

3151.2 --> 3156.0
description

3152.599 --> 3158.4
of the effect rather than a technical

3156.0 --> 3160.8
effect as to what is exactly going on

3158.4 --> 3162.42
which less dense would be more accurate

3160.8 --> 3164.52
basically the G those who we can't use

3162.42 --> 3167.2200000000003
it well that's in the math though when

3164.52 --> 3168.9
when you're just talking about it I'm

3167.22 --> 3171.24
not saying you'd never use the word

3168.9 --> 3174.0
buoyancy again because it is a good

3171.24 --> 3175.5
descriptor you know it is a descriptor

3174.0 --> 3176.64
it's just as soon as you get very

3175.5 --> 3179.22
technical

3176.64 --> 3182.7599999999998
that's when the gravity starts to sneak

3179.22 --> 3184.2
its way in and you don't need it well

3182.76 --> 3186.0
you don't need it

3184.2 --> 3187.98
that's really starting it's like when um

3186.0 --> 3188.76
Rachel with the five zeros was talking

3187.98 --> 3190.38
about

3188.76 --> 3192.5400000000004
she was having a back and forth with

3190.38 --> 3194.1600000000003
Rusty the robot though I don't even know

3192.54 --> 3195.72
who he is but

3194.16 --> 3197.64
um they were talking about these things

3195.72 --> 3199.5
and she was using the terms of the words

3197.64 --> 3201.839
up and down and I said to her in the

3199.5 --> 3204.059
previous video like you're gonna get

3201.839 --> 3206.339
caught out using those words just use

3204.059 --> 3208.2000000000003
more dense and less dense and then the

3206.339 --> 3210.72
next video that Rusty the robot boy did

3208.2 --> 3212.2799999999997
he asked why down and I was like yeah I

3210.72 --> 3214.5589999999997
knew you were going there and it's

3212.28 --> 3216.3590000000004
because down is a noun that we call

3214.559 --> 3218.8190000000004
stuff that moves in the direction of

3216.359 --> 3220.74
Earth we call it down but if we were

3218.819 --> 3222.9
upside down hanging off a tree and we

3220.74 --> 3227.359
saw stuff flying to the sky but that

3222.9 --> 3227.359
would then be down we would call that

3228.079 --> 3233.2200000000003
it's relative to the human so it's like

3231.3 --> 3235.2000000000003
just be careful with the terms up and

3233.22 --> 3237.24
down because that is essentially they

3235.2 --> 3239.339
want it to be a noun they want it to be

3237.24 --> 3241.2
up and down they want down to be the

3239.339 --> 3242.64
direction of gravity and the minute that

3241.2 --> 3245.7599999999998
you allow them to get away with the

3242.64 --> 3247.92
signing gravity to a down then you kind

3245.76 --> 3251.3390000000004
of corn a dirty can claim victory I

3247.92 --> 3253.619
disagree I totally disagree with that no

3251.339 --> 3256.02
it won't because gravity is just

3253.619 --> 3258.96
something they insert without proof

3256.02 --> 3261.66
I think that the it is very acceptable

3258.96 --> 3264.119
to just say up and down you know left

3261.66 --> 3267.24
and right yeah they are at per

3264.119 --> 3270.119
definition always tied into the personal

3267.24 --> 3272.52
orientation right there's no other way

3270.119 --> 3275.04
because there is never any absolute in

3272.52 --> 3278.579
it up and down however well it does

3275.04 --> 3280.44
definitely seem to be very absolute and

3278.579 --> 3282.8390000000004
it doesn't really matter now you can say

3280.44 --> 3285.96
up and down in relation to the person

3282.839 --> 3288.7799999999997
but that's never the default position

3285.96 --> 3290.7
for the argument because when you start

3288.78 --> 3293.94
out using up and down people are always

3290.7 --> 3295.4399999999996
going to refer to the world when you're

3293.94 --> 3296.64
hanging upside down you're never going

3295.44 --> 3299.64
to say

3296.64 --> 3303.839
it's up there down there unless somebody

3299.64 --> 3306.66
asks you where in relation to you is it

3303.839 --> 3308.2799999999997
so when someone says why down to you or

3306.66 --> 3311.359
how do you answer that

3308.28 --> 3311.3590000000004
because it's more dense

3312.0 --> 3315.059
yeah

3313.5 --> 3317.4
I just don't like using the up and down

3315.059 --> 3319.079
because you're buying into Bob's

3317.4 --> 3322.079
argument that there's a downwards bias

3319.079 --> 3326.2400000000002
because most things in here go down

3322.079 --> 3326.2400000000002
now now they don't

3326.94 --> 3331.2000000000003
at least when you're when you go when

3329.099 --> 3333.059
you're gonna go volumetric you know

3331.2 --> 3336.54
there's a lot more gas

3333.059 --> 3338.46
out there that's going up

3336.54 --> 3340.5589999999997
a lot of it it's just that you don't

3338.46 --> 3342.9
really see it you know so it has more to

3340.559 --> 3343.8
do with conscious perception of what is

3342.9 --> 3346.02
around

3343.8 --> 3349.079
but I think that relative density no

3346.02 --> 3352.04
it's not a the majority doesn't go down

3349.079 --> 3352.04
it's pretty even

3352.079 --> 3355.8
because otherwise otherwise there would

3354.78 --> 3357.0
be

3355.8 --> 3359.3390000000004
yeah

3357.0 --> 3361.319
things would go out of whack there would

3359.339 --> 3364.02
be bizarre pressure they have Ranchos

3361.319 --> 3366.72
that would arrive so I disagree no

3364.02 --> 3368.16
everything goes up and down depending on

3366.72 --> 3369.54
the density in relation to what

3368.16 --> 3371.7599999999998
surrounds it

3369.54 --> 3374.22
yeah and that's it

3371.76 --> 3376.5
I I have no objections with up and down

3374.22 --> 3379.98
I'm not afraid

3376.5 --> 3382.38
I have my own ups and downs

3379.98 --> 3385.02
Dum how do you address it when they say

3382.38 --> 3386.339
why is it why is it not sideways what do

3385.02 --> 3389.22
you say to that

3386.339 --> 3390.96
because it isn't

3389.22 --> 3394.2
it it's just not sideways displacement

3390.96 --> 3397.559
though yeah but that's only because yeah

3394.2 --> 3399.7799999999997
it's going to be subjected to trying to

3397.559 --> 3401.94
to find that lower point if it can find

3399.78 --> 3404.3390000000004
it directly below it then it's gonna

3401.94 --> 3406.619
move sideways where there is more

3404.339 --> 3408.24
maneuvering room right so it's going to

3406.619 --> 3410.819
spread out

3408.24 --> 3412.74
because it's just spreading the beach

3410.819 --> 3415.099
when you go to the beach and it's always

3412.74 --> 3417.66
windy at the coast isn't it um because

3415.099 --> 3420.119
the transatlantic winds or whatever

3417.66 --> 3421.7999999999997
wherever you live most people will

3420.119 --> 3424.02
accept that it's more windy at the coast

3421.8 --> 3425.819
well what's the cause for that well the

3424.02 --> 3427.559
sun is heating up the water the surface

3425.819 --> 3430.8
of the water in the Atlantic or the

3427.559 --> 3433.5
Pacific Ocean and when it's when it like

3430.8 --> 3435.48
um it decomposes the hydrogen bond and

3433.5 --> 3438.839
it breaks it down into its vapor form

3435.48 --> 3441.96
it's water gaseous form in Vapor then

3438.839 --> 3443.7599999999998
the the volume of vapor per drop of

3441.96 --> 3446.099
water it's something like ten thousand

3443.76 --> 3447.6600000000003
to one compression ratio it's huge one

3446.099 --> 3450.96
drop of water gives you an awful lot of

3447.66 --> 3453.18
vapor and what when the surface of water

3450.96 --> 3456.2400000000002
is evaporating and it's creating an

3453.18 --> 3459.72
awful a lot more volume of gas

3456.24 --> 3462.4799999999996
that is gas creating pressure over the

3459.72 --> 3464.4599999999996
oceans and when that pressure is that

3462.48 --> 3465.96
high it starts to spread into the low

3464.46 --> 3467.94
pressure area which would be the coax

3465.96 --> 3469.44
line that we're on that's why we feel

3467.94 --> 3471.54
the the wind

3469.44 --> 3475.44
so the wind is the creation of the gas

3471.54 --> 3477.9
molecules at six water favor right the

3475.44 --> 3478.98
water vapor arising pushing on

3477.9 --> 3481.2000000000003
everything

3478.98 --> 3483.54
right so it's also going to push it lat

3481.2 --> 3486.839
inwards because there's not as much

3483.54 --> 3489.66
water pressure rising land inwards so

3486.839 --> 3491.46
that increased amount over the ocean is

3489.66 --> 3493.6189999999997
going to push land inward

3491.46 --> 3496.26
and that's that's what we call wind and

3493.619 --> 3498.54
that's a real world demonstration of

3496.26 --> 3500.7000000000003
lateral displacement caused by relative

3498.54 --> 3502.5589999999997
density because the density gradients is

3500.7 --> 3505.0789999999997
being created at sea level in the over

3502.559 --> 3508.079
the oceans the Pacific all that gas

3505.079 --> 3510.48
molecules is being created by the bucket

3508.079 --> 3512.1600000000003
load over the oceans and it gets pushed

3510.48 --> 3513.72
sideways and we see with wind every

3512.16 --> 3515.04
single day but people just don't realize

3513.72 --> 3517.4599999999996
it because they've not thought about it

3515.04 --> 3520.02
I don't know if that's attribute to

3517.46 --> 3521.7
attributable to relative density though

3520.02 --> 3524.04
I think that's more just pressure

3521.7 --> 3526.02
Dynamics you know all the gases are

3524.04 --> 3528.72
subjected to pressure Dynamics that's

3526.02 --> 3532.799
really the thing that causes wind that

3528.72 --> 3535.2
enables sound effects but it's all just

3532.799 --> 3537.78
pressure because air is not really

3535.2 --> 3542.7
subjected to relative density unless it

3537.78 --> 3545.099
is part of an enclosed object really now

3542.7 --> 3546.7799999999997
if you look at the the if you look at

3545.099 --> 3549.059
when I added the salt to the water I

3546.78 --> 3550.98
added the salt from the top well the

3549.059 --> 3552.599
water creation or the gas creation is on

3550.98 --> 3554.819
the surface of the water so it's like

3552.599 --> 3556.38
adding salt but from the bottom so it's

3554.819 --> 3558.599
creating the pressure from the ground up

3556.38 --> 3561.42
although it's water it's still grounded

3558.599 --> 3564.42
right ground left so it's pressure where

3561.42 --> 3566.04
it is transformed pressure arises but

3564.42 --> 3568.14
it's not going to stay there due to

3566.04 --> 3570.54
relative density it's just going to

3568.14 --> 3574.319
slightly dissolve into the mesh of the

3570.54 --> 3576.299
the gaseous hole that pressure's got to

3574.319 --> 3577.619
go somewhere right right it spreads

3576.299 --> 3579.119
laterally because there's a lot of it

3577.619 --> 3580.619
it's spreading laterally and that's why

3579.119 --> 3582.359
we have wind so it is pressure

3580.619 --> 3583.92
manipulation you're right but it is

3582.359 --> 3585.72
caused by relative density because it's

3583.92 --> 3588.48
the Sun that charges the water that

3585.72 --> 3591.0
gives it the vaporization and process

3588.48 --> 3593.28
that we perceive as pressure which we

3591.0 --> 3594.96
call wind and it's that wind that's

3593.28 --> 3597.299
going from pressure to low pressure

3594.96 --> 3599.16
pressure mediation is what that is no

3597.299 --> 3602.0
but it's going in all directions though

3599.16 --> 3604.799
I'm pretty sure that above the ocean

3602.0 --> 3606.839
the pressure is also going upward so

3604.799 --> 3608.7
it's going all directions but it is

3606.839 --> 3610.2
always going into the directions where

3608.7 --> 3613.6189999999997
there's lower pressure which would be

3610.2 --> 3615.54
above it and sideways so it's not it has

3613.619 --> 3618.2400000000002
nothing to do with relative density like

3615.54 --> 3619.619
that it's literally just air doesn't it

3618.24 --> 3621.66
just described how it's relative dense

3619.619 --> 3625.02
no it's not a relative density relative

3621.66 --> 3626.94
density is only no movement in relation

3625.02 --> 3631.079
to the axis

3626.94 --> 3632.94
just spreading pressure Dynamics higher

3631.079 --> 3634.7400000000002
from higher pressure to lower pressure

3632.94 --> 3636.96
has nothing to do with relative density

3634.74 --> 3639.66
Tony you've just said that the gas

3636.96 --> 3641.579
expands in all directions right yes

3639.66 --> 3643.74
and it's being created at all parts of

3641.579 --> 3645.9
the surface because the sun is boiling

3643.74 --> 3647.3999999999996
the water off it's creating vapor

3645.9 --> 3649.559
yeah

3647.4 --> 3651.059
so it's gonna it's gonna spread in all

3649.559 --> 3652.98
directions that includes lateral

3651.059 --> 3654.5400000000004
displacement yes of course because it's

3652.98 --> 3657.9
going to move to the lower pressure and

3654.54 --> 3661.099
hey if below it there was a giant tunnel

3657.9 --> 3664.44
ending up some way kilometers back

3661.099 --> 3666.42
somewhere with an opening then it would

3664.44 --> 3668.94
go the pressure would go into that

3666.42 --> 3671.64
direction as well because air pressure

3668.94 --> 3673.44
just goes in all Direction and that

3671.64 --> 3675.72
includes water vapor

3673.44 --> 3677.16
does not really subjected by relative

3675.72 --> 3679.5589999999997
density

3677.16 --> 3680.54
well let me send you a quick video copy

3679.559 --> 3682.559
link

3680.54 --> 3683.7
if I send you a link would you be able

3682.559 --> 3685.26
to play this video at a certain

3683.7 --> 3688.3799999999997
timestamp

3685.26 --> 3691.079
maybe I I'm I'm not making it a habit of

3688.38 --> 3695.359
playing videos on my show

3691.079 --> 3695.3590000000004
like to keep it strike free 10 seconds

3695.4 --> 3698.1800000000003
but uh

3699.54 --> 3703.44
what

3701.099 --> 3705.42
what this guy's showing is um the

3703.44 --> 3707.819
lateral displacement of gas so although

3705.42 --> 3709.799
gas goes in all directions because this

3707.819 --> 3711.839
gas is more dense in the short term it

3709.799 --> 3713.579
goes down but there's another gas below

3711.839 --> 3715.859
it that it can't displace because it's

3713.579 --> 3718.44
it's not heavy enough so it laterally

3715.859 --> 3720.7799999999997
displaces so although gas pressure does

3718.44 --> 3723.2400000000002
go available in all directions in time

3720.78 --> 3724.6800000000003
in the short term it does lateral

3723.24 --> 3726.4199999999996
laterally displace and this is

3724.68 --> 3729.839
essentially what wind is

3726.42 --> 3733.079
same same function as wind whoa okay

3729.839 --> 3735.599
that's pretty cool and creepy yeah

3733.079 --> 3737.819
so there so it's like really floating

3735.599 --> 3739.8590000000004
there

3737.819 --> 3741.18
yeah so if you go to the time I'm

3739.859 --> 3743.46
assuming that you're seeing Paul the

3741.18 --> 3745.6189999999997
dynamite sticking or whatever it is

3743.46 --> 3747.78
it's just a flares now the dynamite

3745.619 --> 3750.059
stick otherwise people would be blown

3747.78 --> 3751.7400000000002
away yeah you know what I mean there's

3750.059 --> 3754.92
children around they're not gonna stick

3751.74 --> 3756.4799999999996
dynamite in the ground yeah he's got a

3754.92 --> 3758.64
fleur that's emitting a load of gas and

3756.48 --> 3761.22
he throws it into a into a hole and it

3758.64 --> 3763.6189999999997
fills the hole but not not from the

3761.22 --> 3765.0
bottom it it goes above the bottom right

3763.619 --> 3766.6800000000003
because there's a layer of gas in there

3765.0 --> 3768.9
called carbon dioxide and the point he's

3766.68 --> 3770.52
making is that if you go in there right

3768.9 --> 3772.7400000000002
after a volcanic eruption you're gonna

3770.52 --> 3774.599
die because there's no oxygen and he's

3772.74 --> 3776.7599999999998
showing that there's carbon dioxide by

3774.599 --> 3778.799
putting a gas that's more dense than the

3776.76 --> 3781.8590000000004
air above but less dense than the carbon

3778.799 --> 3783.96
dioxide in the short term to show that

3781.859 --> 3786.299
there is a pocket of carbon dioxide gas

3783.96 --> 3787.799
there and it's and it'll kill you a

3786.299 --> 3789.299
really good demonstration of lateral

3787.799 --> 3791.16
displacement

3789.299 --> 3793.2599999999998
right you know I'm not going to show it

3791.16 --> 3794.64
when I'm gonna post the video in chat so

3793.26 --> 3796.3190000000004
people can watch it themselves it's

3794.64 --> 3798.24
pretty cool

3796.319 --> 3800.579
but it is pretty cool I'm not gonna risk

3798.24 --> 3802.2599999999998
doing this

3800.579 --> 3805.88
and if you if you want to see the time

3802.26 --> 3805.88
song it's in the first third

3807.2 --> 3814.6189999999997
this is it's less it's 131 it's one

3812.46 --> 3818.119
minute 31 seconds I don't think that

3814.619 --> 3818.119
time stamp is that necessary

3818.24 --> 3824.9399999999996
uh obviously I can see you ah yeah yeah

3821.64 --> 3829.92
it's still going okay yeah who just in

3824.94 --> 3832.28
time yeah internet issues but we're back

3829.92 --> 3832.28
right

3832.38 --> 3835.92
I'm gonna go and get a coffee and I'll

3833.64 --> 3837.9
catch on Nathan's in a bit all right hey

3835.92 --> 3840.54
thanks for popping by today what's cool

3837.9 --> 3844.46
no worries nice all right see you later

3840.54 --> 3844.46
see you on the FTD

3844.92 --> 3847.64
all right

3847.74 --> 3850.64
that was nice

3853.859 --> 3856.819
good stuff

3864.48 --> 3869.54
I don't know what foulan Buchanan was so

3867.0 --> 3869.54
upset about

3870.96 --> 3875.04
I really like to

3873.24 --> 3877.4599999999996
having Tony on

3875.04 --> 3877.46
again

3881.96 --> 3889.52
and I'm glad I got

3885.54 --> 3889.52
the sound to get through this time

3897.599 --> 3903.98
right

3899.94 --> 3903.98
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it too

3908.64 --> 3912.6189999999997
the relative density conversation

3913.26 --> 3917.48
I think I'll name this show after it

3919.36 --> 3929.21
[Music]

3943.559 --> 3946.579
that come on

3953.64 --> 3956.1189999999997
right

3956.64 --> 3961.2
heavy gases flow much like water along

3959.579 --> 3964.2000000000003
the ground

3961.2 --> 3966.74
yeah they do at first but it it does

3964.2 --> 3970.04
dissolve basically into the

3966.74 --> 3970.04
inhomogeneous mass

3974.88 --> 3978.48
but it's yeah it's a bit difficult you

3976.98 --> 3981.92
know it's really when you have a

3978.48 --> 3985.319
separated distinct different gas

3981.92 --> 3987.839
then yeah kind of like even liquids in

3985.319 --> 3991.68
the ocean the different

3987.839 --> 3995.0389999999998
like the different water layers just

3991.68 --> 3996.72
keeping separated so bizarre but that

3995.039 --> 4000.44
does seem to happen

3996.72 --> 4002.8999999999996
until it eventually does mix in

4000.44 --> 4005.059
which over times with gases especially

4002.9 --> 4006.6800000000003
it's just very proven that it does that

4005.059 --> 4009.1400000000003
it will mix up

4006.68 --> 4011.98
and then relative density doesn't really

4009.14 --> 4011.98
apply anymore

4012.5 --> 4019.839
it will apply to objects or gases

4015.68 --> 4019.839
isolated within a separate container

4019.94 --> 4023.059
but

4021.079 --> 4026.9
yeah

4023.059 --> 4031.1800000000003
is odd how do you even describe that

4026.9 --> 4031.1800000000003
because relative density doesn't really

4031.52 --> 4037.9
apply to separate gases because it will

4034.76 --> 4037.9
go into all directions

4038.599 --> 4042.98
but

4040.28 --> 4045.3190000000004
yeah and then eventually mix up

4042.98 --> 4048.68
but before they get mixed up especially

4045.319 --> 4052.359
with the heavier gases they do I guess

4048.68 --> 4052.359
stay separate for a while

4052.579 --> 4057.079
and that could be attribute to the

4054.68 --> 4061.16
relative density that like how they

4057.079 --> 4063.6400000000003
respond while being separated

4061.16 --> 4063.64
yeah

4063.7 --> 4067.48
it's something to think about

4075.859 --> 4080.44
what coming out of Gilmore what

4082.039 --> 4087.44
so go down go boom boom

4084.74 --> 4091.72
well no only if it's surrounded by other

4087.44 --> 4091.7200000000003
gases that are less dense than it

4092.72 --> 4097.299
then at first it might go down go boom

4095.059 --> 4097.299
boom

4097.4 --> 4102.5599999999995
and eventually it will spread out

4100.1 --> 4104.719
and become part of the inhomogeneous

4102.56 --> 4107.859
mass of air

4104.719 --> 4107.859
which goes in all directions

4118.699 --> 4121.239
hmm

4136.52 --> 4139.359
all right

4147.56 --> 4151.759
oh man

4149.54 --> 4156.219
I want tea

4151.759 --> 4156.219
I didn't make any because it was too hot

4178.819 --> 4181.359
right

4182.9 --> 4188.0
what's the temperature I don't know what

4185.66 --> 4190.4
is it currently

4188.0 --> 4191.6
officially

4190.4 --> 4194.33
oh

4191.6 --> 4197.38
there's still wind going down

4194.33 --> 4197.38
[Music]

4199.58 --> 4203.92
says it's 14 degrees Celsius

4209.42 --> 4214.46
which is not that warm at all

4212.78 --> 4216.86
but I guess that

4214.46 --> 4219.38
it's it's really the sun that's just

4216.86 --> 4222.339999999999
making it warm because there the wind is

4219.38 --> 4222.34
not helping

4224.48 --> 4231.82
it's it says it's currently at 26

4227.84 --> 4231.82
kilometers an hour wind

4238.159 --> 4243.0199999999995
hmm

4240.679 --> 4245.719
it is predicting that the the wind is

4243.02 --> 4247.34
going to go down a lot at least in the

4245.719 --> 4249.199
next week

4247.34 --> 4251.6
but then it also says it's going to be

4249.199 --> 4254.139999999999
rainy

4251.6 --> 4254.14
right

4274.0 --> 4281.0
what I have a link to a video showing

4276.8 --> 4284.62
bro mine bromine into vacuum

4281.0 --> 4284.62
and into non-vacue

4285.62 --> 4290.32
but it still goes up not down

4291.44 --> 4298.639999999999
well I'm not sure but is bromine gas

4295.76 --> 4300.92
what is its density in relation to the

4298.64 --> 4303.14
average error is it

4300.92 --> 4306.4
is it less dense because then it would

4303.14 --> 4306.400000000001
make sense that it would go up

4324.739 --> 4327.28
okay

4327.44 --> 4332.299999999999
all right I don't know the video you're

4330.32 --> 4336.219
talking about where it supposedly goes

4332.3 --> 4336.219
up I don't know why it would do that

4345.32 --> 4347.98
hmm

4355.82 --> 4361.94
well can you link the video Iron 26

4360.14 --> 4365.860000000001
I'd be interested to take a look at that

4361.94 --> 4365.86
think Tony will probably too

4372.44 --> 4374.799999999999
oh

4392.9 --> 4398.599999999999
well Batman Forever yeah he will call

4396.08 --> 4402.0199999999995
you a [ __ ] wit at some point if

4398.6 --> 4404.84
especially if your timing is bad right

4402.02 --> 4407.96
because when Nathan starts to dig into a

4404.84 --> 4409.58
baller cognitive dissonance that and all

4407.96 --> 4411.38
that nonsense

4409.58 --> 4414.0199999999995
like he gets

4411.38 --> 4416.900000000001
more aggressive and if you then try to

4414.02 --> 4419.42
step in yeah he's gonna you're literally

4416.9 --> 4422.36
gonna get the full blow

4419.42 --> 4424.9400000000005
it's like trying to get in between him

4422.36 --> 4427.099999999999
and prey then he will get rough at you

4424.94 --> 4429.5599999999995
and he does that with us as well with me

4427.1 --> 4431.2390000000005
and chocolate and everybody that that

4429.56 --> 4433.820000000001
might butt in

4431.239 --> 4436.599999999999
when he's really at it so you got to be

4433.82 --> 4436.599999999999
careful about that

4439.52 --> 4444.9400000000005
but yeah he doesn't just start out this

4442.699 --> 4444.94
route

4448.58 --> 4451.179
hmm

4451.4 --> 4457.9
okay let me take a look at the

4454.46 --> 4457.9
iron 26's video

4467.0 --> 4469.78
okay

4488.719 --> 4494.26
huh

4491.42 --> 4494.26
weird

4497.32 --> 4501.699
diffusion of gases What

4506.0 --> 4508.48
what

4510.08 --> 4515.12
oh okay I'll have to study that video

4513.199 --> 4517.4
with sound

4515.12 --> 4521.199
iron 26 that's

4517.4 --> 4521.199
that looks very interesting

4521.239 --> 4526.0
oh what did you link to sleeping where

4523.46 --> 4526.0
oh God

4526.58 --> 4532.0599999999995
Bob no Dell's gas attack

4529.4 --> 4532.0599999999995
uh

4535.159 --> 4539.259999999999
uh is this from yesterday

4554.9 --> 4557.5599999999995
hmm

4561.38 --> 4566.02
hello clutch where there good morning

4593.659 --> 4596.32
hmm

4621.44 --> 4626.44
hey good morning Julia Bevin good to see

4624.26 --> 4626.4400000000005

4636.98 --> 4640.0599999999995
oh man

4642.38 --> 4646.6990000000005
that's

4644.239 --> 4649.639999999999
it's definitely cooling down over here

4646.699 --> 4653.5
now that the sun is not hitting the wall

4649.64 --> 4653.5
as much it's really cooling down

4669.96 --> 4673.01
[Music]

4685.04 --> 4689.719
wow

4686.239 --> 4692.9
okay thank you Al junkie for the 2.29

4689.719 --> 4697.1
Super Chat donation in the Dutch comment

4692.9 --> 4699.219
Zumba aravind is hit f a domain minder

4697.1 --> 4699.219

4699.46 --> 4703.9
Little Dutch rhyme thank you for that

4715.52 --> 4721.96
is

4717.02 --> 4721.96
uh that's harsh Adam that's really harsh

4744.32 --> 4751.84
no and Adam did she fall for it too or

4747.86 --> 4751.839999999999
did she figure it out

4771.76 --> 4775.2390000000005
she went up

4780.88 --> 4787.04
so she figured it out I wasn't that

4783.44 --> 4789.98
wasn't the density question by the way

4787.04 --> 4791.06
oh hello or Roger MC I didn't know you

4789.98 --> 4794.5599999999995
were

4791.06 --> 4794.56
flat earther these days

4807.91 --> 4811.12
[Music]

4817.719 --> 4821.56
oh very funny

4826.699 --> 4829.659
oh man

4835.33 --> 4838.43
[Music]

4854.96 --> 4857.9800000000005
right so

4864.44 --> 4869.919999999999
spreading that joke okay Adam

4866.719 --> 4869.92
over at Skype

4889.58 --> 4892.36
wow

4892.94 --> 4895.659
that's weird

4928.219 --> 4933.52
right so guys I still got like a half an

4931.04 --> 4933.5199999999995
hour left

4934.04 --> 4937.82
so if there's anything specific you

4935.96 --> 4940.159
would like me to address

4937.82 --> 4944.62
because otherwise I'm just probably just

4940.159 --> 4944.62
gonna sit here kind of being in silence

4944.719 --> 4948.34
also because I'm hungry

4958.58 --> 4963.32
I don't watch Gary Terry nah that's

4961.58 --> 4966.699
right I missed Gary and Terry yesterday

4963.32 --> 4966.699
I did watch it back though

4967.94 --> 4972.4
I was doing my newspaper rounds in the

4969.98 --> 4972.4
middle of that

4973.159 --> 4975.759999999999
uh

4979.96 --> 4985.1
shut it down early go eat ah

5001.96 --> 5005.86
hmm

5003.64 --> 5010.320000000001
but anyway I hope everybody's doing good

5005.86 --> 5010.32
and looking forward to spring coming

5010.48 --> 5017.159
hey L junkie dress the moon map

5014.199 --> 5017.159
oh God

5017.44 --> 5021.36
which moon which moon map

5022.96 --> 5029.5
the one that that you can't actually

5025.54 --> 5032.0199999999995
zoom in on in the real world

5029.5 --> 5034.679
but they did it anyway and then made a

5032.02 --> 5034.679
map out of it

5036.64 --> 5041.58
I remember that thing coming by a long

5038.98 --> 5041.58
time ago

5043.239 --> 5046.78
I thought there was like this baller

5044.98 --> 5050.5199999999995
like in the early Flat Earth the beta

5046.78 --> 5050.5199999999995
was totally about that Moon math

5050.82 --> 5056.32
well yeah that

5052.96 --> 5059.9800000000005
problem is most things gave me that

5056.32 --> 5063.699
response oh not again

5059.98 --> 5063.699
it's all tomfoolery

5078.6 --> 5085.2390000000005
oh I did see by the way over at RT was

5082.42 --> 5089.219
that yesterday something popped into my

5085.239 --> 5091.139999999999
in the eye that apparently like Russian

5089.219 --> 5094.9
cosmonauts were

5091.14 --> 5099.04
basically open for questioning

5094.9 --> 5101.5599999999995
about space and all that so they were

5099.04 --> 5104.26
doing that

5101.56 --> 5107.26
apparently I haven't watched the video

5104.26 --> 5109.5
myself but I picked up on the title of

5107.26 --> 5109.5
that

5109.659 --> 5115.179
might be interesting what they're gonna

5111.46 --> 5118.14
say or it's just going to be the same

5115.179 --> 5118.14
typical stuff

5122.8 --> 5126.360000000001
see if I can find that back

5126.699 --> 5133.36
I should have posted it

5129.76 --> 5134.4400000000005
sometimes I just bump into things and

5133.36 --> 5138.04
then I think

5134.44 --> 5139.9
like yeah that would probably be a good

5138.04 --> 5143.38
interesting point

5139.9 --> 5145.96
and then I basically go meh

5143.38 --> 5149.52
and then I don't make a note of it I

5145.96 --> 5149.52
don't know why what the hell

5159.04 --> 5165.179
what okay that's not what what I was

5162.76 --> 5165.179
looking for

5165.82 --> 5170.92
some article about xenobots with an

5169.3 --> 5173.639
animated picture

5170.92 --> 5173.639
weird

5180.52 --> 5183.6
where is it

5197.38 --> 5200.88
I think I lost it

5227.739 --> 5231.959999999999
nope can't find it too bad

5235.12 --> 5239.04
ah let's see what you guys are saying

5245.86 --> 5251.44
is that the clay Moon reflects

5248.44 --> 5253.9
continents no iron 26

5251.44 --> 5257.86
that's not that's not that claim now

5253.9 --> 5260.92
there is supposedly a zoomed in Moon map

5257.86 --> 5263.38
and I think it came through NASA

5260.92 --> 5266.5
where they basically took the the

5263.38 --> 5267.9400000000005
typical holographic signature of the

5266.5 --> 5269.739
Moon

5267.94 --> 5274.54
and then

5269.739 --> 5277.9
basically zoomed it out or zoomed it in

5274.54 --> 5280.659
and then in reality it's just blurry

5277.9 --> 5282.82
there's nothing really there detail wise

5280.659 --> 5285.28
doesn't really matter what you do

5282.82 --> 5289.179
but they basically

5285.28 --> 5291.58
well made an artist rendition of it to

5289.179 --> 5292.84
make it into

5291.58 --> 5296.0199999999995
a map

5292.84 --> 5298.42
so they used the the picture of the Moon

5296.02 --> 5300.76
and then basically

5298.42 --> 5303.82
made a map on top of it

5300.76 --> 5306.179
and that that is what they gave out and

5303.82 --> 5310.36
supposedly on that map you can still see

5306.179 --> 5312.6990000000005
the creators and where what thing has

5310.36 --> 5314.92
been left behind or what satellite

5312.699 --> 5316.599999999999
crashed or all that [ __ ] is still

5314.92 --> 5318.1
supposed to be on there

5316.6 --> 5320.5
I think

5318.1 --> 5323.56
I don't know if it's been updated

5320.5 --> 5326.1
but that map moon map has been out there

5323.56 --> 5326.1
for a while

5346.42 --> 5350.159
hey what is that Elgin

5361.3 --> 5363.96
oh

5376.48 --> 5379.44
wait what is this

5402.04 --> 5406.9
and moon map

5404.86 --> 5409.299999999999
oh that

5406.9 --> 5411.46
I remember yeah I think it's a really

5409.3 --> 5414.6990000000005
messy project that they made I don't

5411.46 --> 5417.699
think that's real at all

5414.699 --> 5417.699
Junkie

5428.02 --> 5432.0
all right now kumu virus glad

5433.06 --> 5436.26
you're enjoying it

5438.159 --> 5442.0599999999995
I don't know why my resolution is so

5440.199 --> 5444.299999999999
crappy though oh there you go it's

5442.06 --> 5444.3
better

5452.26 --> 5456.35
[Music]

5459.82 --> 5461.82
um

5465.58 --> 5471.219
right oh but I am very seriously hungry

5469.239 --> 5473.259999999999
I think I am going to round out the show

5471.219 --> 5475.6
a little short

5473.26 --> 5477.58
a little soon

5475.6 --> 5480.58
to get some lunch because it's like

5477.58 --> 5482.86
really nagging on me

5480.58 --> 5485.28
and then I'll get on to the Flat Earth

5482.86 --> 5485.28

5507.88 --> 5511.2390000000005
but yeah it was good having sleeping

5509.86 --> 5513.28

5511.239 --> 5515.98
density again

5513.28 --> 5518.259999999999
if you like the show please don't forget

if you can help out please do so

5560.98 --> 5564.78
I'll try to be more focused

5565.0 --> 5570.28
yeah it's also the springtime is just

5567.34 --> 5572.4400000000005
majorly distracting me

5570.28 --> 5575.199
getting all kinds of dreams about women

5572.44 --> 5577.739
and stuff that's just very distracting

5575.199 --> 5580.48
it's just

5577.739 --> 5584.58
it's the spring it's the Spring's fault

5580.48 --> 5584.58
