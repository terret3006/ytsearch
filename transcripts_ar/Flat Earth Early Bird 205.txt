44.39 --> 48.44
Arwen and before we start the show

46.519 --> 50.899
please don't forget to share it on any

48.44 --> 53.059
platform you deem fit and if you haven't

50.899 --> 54.68
already subscribed to my channel and hit

53.059 --> 56.209999999999994
the bell notification so you know what

54.68 --> 60.32
I'm going live which is normally 2:00

56.21 --> 63.17
p.m. amsterdam time yeah today the

60.32 --> 64.97
weather is little bit cold at me

63.17 --> 69.17
yesterday it's there's been this

64.97 --> 73.85
incredible thunderstorm this night I was

69.17 --> 77.45
like sitting here and just a lightning

73.85 --> 81.619
there there was like a phase lasted over

77.45 --> 84.649
an hour or literally you would see some

81.619 --> 87.56
kind of lightning flash every two

84.649 --> 91.369
seconds every two seconds for an hour

87.56 --> 93.71000000000001
long it was just kept on raging it's a

91.369 --> 97.459
and even at one point lightning hit

93.71 --> 101.08999999999999
pretty close like maybe one or two miles

97.459 --> 105.05
away with the huge bang and it was

101.09 --> 112.069
interesting it was enervating it felt

105.05 --> 116.119
purging on the other hand though yep and

112.069 --> 119.41
by the way let me just show you so it

116.119 --> 123.16
now it's just cloudy it's it's fresher

119.41 --> 123.16
it's still decent

123.74 --> 131.2
but yeah it does look and feel like it

127.159 --> 131.20000000000002
could just rain at any moment

131.92 --> 137.70899999999997
exactly of course on the day I have to

134.3 --> 140.63000000000002
do my paper rounds which got completely

137.709 --> 142.34
wet yesterday as they dropped it off in

140.63 --> 145.32999999999998
front of the door right before the storm

142.34 --> 147.53
started so that was just great again I

145.33 --> 149.9
don't know I'm gonna have to look at

147.53 --> 151.52
them if they're properly dried up

149.9 --> 154.67000000000002
otherwise I'm just gonna have to skip it

151.52 --> 157.01000000000002
again because this happened like two

154.67 --> 160.60999999999999
months ago exactly this and I even send

157.01 --> 163.16
an email about it now on the other hand

160.61 --> 165.89000000000001
I'm not entirely sure if I even noticed

163.16 --> 167.989
the bell ringing because yeah downstairs

165.89 --> 172.94
they were very active and the Bell was

167.989 --> 177.13
kind of ringing all the time so I don't

172.94 --> 180.43
know what happened but yeah we'll see I

177.13 --> 187.13
got to Tamara coffee with me today again

180.43 --> 191.38
auntie no animals what yeah good enough

187.13 --> 194.84
for me I kind of went a little overboard

191.38 --> 197.35999999999999
yesterday evening I had scored some

194.84 --> 201.709
beers because it just felt like it but

197.36 --> 205.91000000000003
then I kind of yeah overdid it by also

201.709 --> 208.79
getting like regular candy like very

205.91 --> 212.72
old-fashioned stuff that doesn't really

208.79 --> 214.7
exist in organic variety and it's it's

212.72 --> 217.97
crap and like I shouldn't have done that

214.7 --> 219.54899999999998
because I was like kind of half sick the

217.97 --> 225.049
rest of the evening

219.549 --> 229.0
it's not healthy like it's okay to like

225.049 --> 229.0
sometimes get that and then just

229.15 --> 236.59
but not combining it with alcohol and I

232.209 --> 239.31900000000002
wasn't very smart of me but yeah I'm

236.59 --> 252.129
pretty much over that no I don't have a

239.319 --> 258.25
hangover or anything so yeah this

252.129 --> 261.94
morning was weird that was like a very

258.25 --> 262.84
odd situation rarely happens I was in

261.94 --> 267.419
the coffee shop

262.84 --> 272.65
yay yeah I go there and you're early and

267.419 --> 275.40999999999997
I was just sitting there like I'm not in

272.65 --> 277.63
a very talkative mood I could if like

275.41 --> 280.0
there's a real spirit going I mean in

277.63 --> 282.96999999999997
the morning it just doesn't happen this

280.0 --> 285.76
guy was sitting there and he was being

282.97 --> 290.35
very loud and he was like complaining

285.76 --> 293.38
about Christianity but in a like Pro

290.35 --> 297.47900000000004
Christ's way and they sit so corrupted

293.38 --> 305.77
and but then he like went off into just

297.479 --> 307.93
total playing style interpretation of it

305.77 --> 311.26
it was so crappy and he basically like

307.93 --> 314.02
said oh the Bible's been corrupted and

311.26 --> 315.43
like and then he would against it it

314.02 --> 318.099
didn't make it he was basically

315.43 --> 321.61
bordering psychosis it was like somebody

318.099 --> 325.93
who'd be watching the really crappy

321.61 --> 328.539
videos that would be jumbo and also

325.93 --> 331.66
exciting but the sense of it would not

328.539 --> 333.669
be so continuous would be more hypee and

331.66 --> 336.88000000000005
that guy probably has been watching that

333.669 --> 339.15999999999997
and I kind of walked away at some point

336.88 --> 341.56
because he was literally annoying people

339.16 --> 342.46000000000004
and they didn't really know how to

341.56 --> 345.82
response

342.46 --> 347.5
they had like - like oh silent or just

345.82 --> 349.51
like kind of going along I know how it

347.5 --> 351.639
is because they were kind of scared over

349.51 --> 354.15999999999997
him because they are freaking wussies

351.639 --> 357.01
but anyway I walked away then he came

354.16 --> 359.62
over to the other room where I went in

357.01 --> 362.919
and just started talking to me and

359.62 --> 367.719
that's okay because he didn't

362.919 --> 369.46
yeah yeah they don't get it like they

367.719 --> 373.18
don't understand it all anything about

369.46 --> 375.46
it and I mean like yeah but you can I

373.18 --> 379.21
really basically started just educating

375.46 --> 381.34
and like yeah it doesn't work that way

379.21 --> 385.35999999999996
you can't just force things on people

381.34 --> 387.46
like that you gotta you got to draw them

385.36 --> 389.22900000000004
out first and see what they're into you

387.46 --> 391.9
got to see who they are

389.229 --> 393.49
you can't just be looking at that thing

391.9 --> 395.94899999999996
in your mind that you think is so

393.49 --> 399.669
important and then just smash it out

395.949 --> 401.529
there like without considering who

399.669 --> 404.65
you're basically dealing with just

401.529 --> 406.509
trying to try it out until the person

404.65 --> 410.10999999999996
walks away that's not a viable strategy

406.509 --> 413.77000000000004
yeah went pretty serious with it it kind

410.11 --> 416.02000000000004
of got it but then he tried to basically

413.77 --> 418.56899999999996
go on the level with me and made all

416.02 --> 421.529
these bizarre statements about the Bible

418.569 --> 424.68
and it was pretty much blasphemous

421.529 --> 426.58
accidentally this weird

424.68 --> 428.8
conceptualizations like you know how did

426.58 --> 430.96
the Bible start so yeah there was God

428.8 --> 435.61
and then God spoke and the word

430.96 --> 439.33
basically was the manifest creation and

435.61 --> 443.83000000000004
he just said no first I was space and

439.33 --> 447.69899999999996
time and magnetism like what a [ __ ] dude

443.83 --> 452.10999999999996
are you what that's that's not biblical

447.699 --> 456.279
he that's a conceptualization reminds me

452.11 --> 460.27000000000004
of electric universe but still yeah

456.279 --> 462.759
outer space he obviously had didn't know

460.27 --> 467.43899999999996
a lot of stuff it was annoying so every

462.759 --> 469.27000000000004
basically just said do this I'm not

467.439 --> 473.71000000000004
gonna go in conversation with you you

469.27 --> 477.219
did you don't listen and he didn't even

473.71 --> 478.93
get it so I like it's just well there's

477.219 --> 481.56
these types and types of people out

478.93 --> 484.599
there and they're obviously used to

481.56 --> 485.949
comments forums talking over the

484.599 --> 487.659
internet and not so much

485.949 --> 491.379
person-to-person at all

487.659 --> 493.69
it was kind of weird I didn't even bring

491.379 --> 497.77000000000004
up flat earth or anything I could

493.69 --> 502.75
he probably would just go nuts so that

497.77 --> 506.56
happened this morning I have no ill will

502.75 --> 511.99
to the guy but he was kind of annoying

506.56 --> 514.169
and ill-mannered so hey X 320 welcome

511.99 --> 514.169
back

514.74 --> 520.75
Daniel is also in chat wanting to talk

517.9 --> 527.1

576.81 --> 583.92

580.47 --> 585.99
alter the volume of the music the the

583.92 --> 589.3499999999999
intro because that is so much louder

585.99 --> 593.46
it's like like hits my ears every time I

589.35 --> 595.95
listen to my own videos so I would like

593.46 --> 598.71
to be able to tone that down but there

595.95 --> 601.37
is no like permanent fashion you could

598.71 --> 606.77
regulate that in just using OBS

601.37 --> 606.77
unfortunately so yeah

625.51 --> 632.7

really interesting articles and natural

655.33 --> 661.6600000000001
news today yeah I caught myself

657.01 --> 665.14
commenting several articles one was

661.66 --> 667.649
about the placebo effect and how

665.14 --> 671.14
powerful it really turns out to be ad

667.649 --> 680.83
like it's a serious study focus to that

671.14 --> 682.959
and that's just remarkable see oh hey

680.83 --> 686.62
thanks for the super chair donation Theo

682.959 --> 688.93
Megawati level and plumb our level and

686.62 --> 691.99
plumb everywhere on earth it takes

688.93 --> 699.279
faith-based presuppositions to assume

691.99 --> 701.29
they are 10 gen 10 dead tangential don't

699.279 --> 706.02
you mean 10 gentle but anyway as

701.29 --> 706.02
required by a globe right

712.25 --> 718.32
Thanks so anyway one was about yeah

716.22 --> 720.1800000000001
about magic mushrooms medical benefits

718.32 --> 722.61
of that did that I didn't expect one of

720.18 --> 726.959
those articles to pop up on natural news

722.61 --> 728.49
even though it is true but it was a good

726.959 --> 733.16
art yeah lots of good articles today

728.49 --> 733.16
they're interesting stuff

739.8 --> 747.149
what else yeah I had something saved in

744.37 --> 747.149
my Lynx

755.95 --> 759.19
is this

764.2 --> 771.6700000000001
oh yeah now remember yeah it was an

769.12 --> 775.86
Infowars article actually and I usually

771.67 --> 775.86
don't get into this but this was such

776.1 --> 787.269
there was I don't know it's like open

784.209 --> 790.779
evil like this I'll just try to

787.269 --> 794.44
summarize it it's an info article that

790.779 --> 797.769
just is about a single clip where a Joe

794.44 --> 801.19
Biden and you all know who is creepy

797.769 --> 805.089
Uncle Joe it's basically addressing an

801.19 --> 812.4300000000001
audience Human Rights Campaign and he

805.089 --> 817.36
literally was kind of like it was normal

812.43 --> 819.279
but I'll just quote it and then I will

817.36 --> 823.9590000000001
speak my opinion about it okay so what

819.279 --> 826.779
he said is we've already had five just

823.959 --> 830.43
this year we've already had five black

826.779 --> 833.14
transgender woman killed in violence in

830.43 --> 835.6899999999999
2090 it's outrageous it must end it must

833.14 --> 839.1
end and the fastest way to end it is to

835.69 --> 847.6400000000001
end the Trump administration it's like

839.1 --> 850.7900000000001
dude what does that have to do with it

847.64 --> 856.54
it it sounds like a hostage situation

850.79 --> 856.54
like that it's just anyway yeah

859.149 --> 862.57
crazy stuff

874.96 --> 882.49
like how do you connect the two but yeah

878.73 --> 884.07
they're getting all more blatantly

882.49 --> 887.44
doublethink it's like they're getting

884.07 --> 890.0200000000001
impatience with reality so they're just

887.44 --> 892.57
pushing the double thing harder like

890.02 --> 895.42
they're just building a construct in

892.57 --> 898.33
order to progress and they don't give a

895.42 --> 899.709
[ __ ] about reality anymore they don't

898.33 --> 901.75
give a [ __ ] if it doesn't make sense

899.709 --> 906.43
anymore they just use the intimidation

901.75 --> 909.43
of the double thing of it and that's

906.43 --> 912.9399999999999
become their strategy now there are

909.43 --> 914.52
literally the 90-84 party it's pretty

912.94 --> 917.73
much what it comes down to

914.52 --> 917.73
[Music]

922.31 --> 931.0799999999999
so anyway yeah enough about that I

925.04 --> 934.05
thought it was quote worthy and I do

931.08 --> 938.25
find like Joe Biden is kind of a

934.05 --> 941.66
fascinating character to me for for one

938.25 --> 947.06
of the liberals it's such a weird guy

941.66 --> 950.4599999999999
and he is devious like at some point

947.06 --> 952.1999999999999
they like a long time ago he was like

950.46 --> 953.73
being called out by a journalist and

952.2 --> 956.7900000000001
then he like it literally started like

953.73 --> 958.77
whoa but I my IQ is so high and you

956.79 --> 961.29
don't know anything it's like he was

958.77 --> 964.71
basically baller raging almost like nerd

961.29 --> 968.73
raging to try to out love him it was

964.71 --> 973.46
crazy it's just such a weird guy the

968.73 --> 973.46
things he does is are so weird odd to me

977.75 --> 986.44
I wonder like how much waking conscious

983.48 --> 986.44
does he really have

989.279 --> 995.189
it almost feels like the guy really is

992.009 --> 997.519
living in like a permanent dream it's so

995.189 --> 997.519
weird

1001.75 --> 1006.5
yeah good morning

1041.589 --> 1051.1789999999999
still too busy with that yeah

1053.34 --> 1060.0

1067.2 --> 1074.25
the advertisement I can't like yeah for

1072.03 --> 1077.76
hours watching that screen intensely

1074.25 --> 1080.88
every word no no but I definitely do it

1077.76 --> 1083.85
really is like a listening show where

1080.88 --> 1085.92
you can also like get fragments and then

1083.85 --> 1090.4499999999998
it's worth to take a look you know

1085.92 --> 1093.15
that's how I treat that that thing but

1090.45 --> 1096.6000000000001
the amazing part of it all is that all

1093.15 --> 1098.76
these different channels that I get to

1096.6 --> 1102.2099999999998
see and other like people that I haven't

1098.76 --> 1108.0
seen for a long time then watch them

1102.21 --> 1110.73
again in a more recent video and I see

1108.0 --> 1114.51
all these echoes all these echoes of

1110.73 --> 1117.3
sayings and new insights that we've

1114.51 --> 1120.57
dealt with pretty early on it's like

1117.3 --> 1125.7
echoing on everybody is starting to get

1120.57 --> 1129.1799999999998
a certain grip critical thinking is like

1125.7 --> 1134.6100000000001
working its way from the bottom up in

1129.18 --> 1136.89
the roots of people that that are all

1134.61 --> 1139.11
starting to get it they're all starting

1136.89 --> 1143.3100000000002
to feel the grassroots between their

1139.11 --> 1147.4799999999998
toes as it were and of course the actual

1143.31 --> 1150.03
toes like Joe Rogan and other small head

1147.48 --> 1152.7
figures they're feeling it like nobody

1150.03 --> 1154.74
else because yeah they're very small so

1152.7 --> 1157.3400000000001
yeah anyway that's my symbolic

1154.74 --> 1157.34
comparison

1166.45 --> 1176.06
yeah but I'm starting to feel the echoes

1173.93 --> 1180.3400000000001
of the critical thoughts and analysis

1176.06 --> 1184.31
and just the careful approaches and it's

1180.34 --> 1187.82
wiping down because all of the cause you

1184.31 --> 1189.77
have to all remember just try to think

1187.82 --> 1191.81
clearly of the spectrum of all things

1189.77 --> 1194.03
not how it you interacted with but just

1191.81 --> 1197.03
what was happening try to remember it

1194.03 --> 1199.58
without untangling your feelings with it

1197.03 --> 1202.84
without comparing it not making it as an

1199.58 --> 1204.05
interactive deduction remember back

1202.84 --> 1209.86
conspiracies

1204.05 --> 1214.31
it was always hyped like very clear talk

1209.86 --> 1220.25
calm clear talk that pretty much was new

1214.31 --> 1222.86
in the in the 2000s like for example

1220.25 --> 1226.67
David David Icke was one of the first

1222.86 --> 1230.6599999999999
clear talkers really taking his time and

1226.67 --> 1233.39
calmly explaining the concept really

1230.66 --> 1235.1000000000001
clearly that was kind of new that that's

1233.39 --> 1238.8100000000002
why he became so popular at first

1235.1 --> 1241.73
because he really had a thing but now

1238.81 --> 1243.4099999999999
there's just more groups that are

1241.73 --> 1245.06
starting to figure out like yeah if you

1243.41 --> 1246.77
just don't over hype but you can try to

1245.06 --> 1248.9299999999998
come to an understanding and learn more

1246.77 --> 1250.73
that's what we are doing in the debates

1248.93 --> 1252.47
but there's many many people that

1250.73 --> 1255.74
basically are trying to do that talk

1252.47 --> 1258.3500000000001
shows people talk show people even high

1255.74 --> 1260.09
tier that just try to get interesting

1258.35 --> 1263.7099999999998
guests and get it all rolling you know

1260.09 --> 1268.6999999999998
Silvo conversation and this is all

1263.71 --> 1271.4
pretty new in the real deep thinking and

1268.7 --> 1274.64
occult and conspiracy because it used to

1271.4 --> 1278.27
be so hyped so more anchored in fear

1274.64 --> 1281.48
porn and it's more subtle now more more

1278.27 --> 1282.83
more insightful into how controlling and

1281.48 --> 1285.34
everything really works and the

1282.83 --> 1288.1999999999998
psychology of it all and the societal

1285.34 --> 1291.05
effects and influences and the spirit

1288.2 --> 1293.8300000000002
and the method and all that and it's

1291.05 --> 1298.23
starting to sink in and this is new and

1293.83 --> 1303.5
it's extremely promising because

1298.23 --> 1307.2
if that mind is gonna take hold then

1303.5 --> 1309.36
it'll take a grip on everyone on pretty

1307.2 --> 1313.8600000000001
much everyone and yeah only the people

1309.36 --> 1315.51
just that stumble in communication like

1313.86 --> 1318.06
for example the guy that what I was

1315.51 --> 1319.95
talking about will just have so much

1318.06 --> 1322.71
trouble overseeing the complete

1319.95 --> 1324.47
consequences of it but most of the

1322.71 --> 1327.0900000000001
intelligent people will probably

1324.47 --> 1330.77
eventually have it sink in and that'll

1327.09 --> 1335.25
kind of dispel this weird crazy

1330.77 --> 1337.47
programming and then even a lot of

1335.25 --> 1340.29
people that are like moving along with

1337.47 --> 1344.79
the dark ones will just step away all of

1340.29 --> 1346.56
a sudden and like really like the evil

1344.79 --> 1349.08
is dispelled I think that's gonna happen

1346.56 --> 1353.25
thanks to this thanks to the grass root

1349.08 --> 1355.1399999999999
critical thought growth it's starting to

1353.25 --> 1358.34
take a grip it's starting to get in

1355.14 --> 1358.3400000000001
between people's toes

1365.62 --> 1368.9089999999999
so this is good

1377.22 --> 1384.49
it's it's kind of important to root not

1382.06 --> 1388.09
just to remember your own development

1384.49 --> 1391.57
but also remember the raw interpretation

1388.09 --> 1393.85
of a moment it's and with certain moment

1391.57 --> 1396.34
people do have it's like oh 9/11 changed

1393.85 --> 1398.9199999999998
everything so where were you when night

1396.34 --> 1401.56
you found out about 9/11 and how would

1398.92 --> 1403.96
that people remember that because it was

1401.56 --> 1409.87
designed specifically to manipulate

1403.96 --> 1414.8500000000001
people heavily and to transform them to

1409.87 --> 1417.79
a new type of setup for the world but if

1414.85 --> 1420.1599999999999
you just remember like before that how

1417.79 --> 1422.43
would everybody riding along what was

1420.16 --> 1425.38
the atmosphere what were the typical

1422.43 --> 1428.5600000000002
levels of the information sources being

1425.38 --> 1431.2900000000002
presented what was the methods and then

1428.56 --> 1434.98
after that how things switched around

1431.29 --> 1436.45
suddenly and conspiracy people instead

1434.98 --> 1438.46
of just being like ooh that's an

1436.45 --> 1441.8500000000001
interesting oddity they also started to

1438.46 --> 1444.6000000000001
get like a look there's hostile forces

1441.85 --> 1448.1499999999999
in the government and this is more

1444.6 --> 1450.4599999999998
direct lead it was more right on the

1448.15 --> 1453.2800000000002
face like the conspiracy theory instead

1450.46 --> 1456.94
of just journalists that were taking

1453.28 --> 1458.95
risks and yeah very dangerous it was

1456.94 --> 1461.3500000000001
people now using social media to

1458.95 --> 1463.63
basically like journalists step forward

1461.35 --> 1468.1
and immediately start digging unabated

1463.63 --> 1471.5700000000002
by any controllers and that became the

1468.1 --> 1471.57
new alternative media

1473.66 --> 1481.3100000000002
and that enforced something that

1477.8 --> 1485.3899999999999
information just occurred on and changed

1481.31 --> 1488.75
the landscape the common people a lot

1485.39 --> 1492.8300000000002
people gained talking hobbies because of

1488.75 --> 1494.57
these types of speakers people that were

1492.83 --> 1497.6299999999999
just dwelling would subtly find

1494.57 --> 1500.8999999999999
something that is inspiring and and get

1497.63 --> 1503.5400000000002
a goal and then use that go in order to

1500.9 --> 1506.9
start conversations or to make a stand

1503.54 --> 1513.59
with points and before that that wasn't

1506.9 --> 1517.1000000000001
there so much I was more obscure in a

1513.59 --> 1520.97
way and now it's been more uniformly

1517.1 --> 1522.59
spread out it's yeah it's different they

1520.97 --> 1524.66
really tried to get that away but it

1522.59 --> 1528.4399999999998
made a comeback and it's yeah it's

1524.66 --> 1531.53
naturally unfolded within the framework

1528.44 --> 1535.04
of everything we're dealing with because

1531.53 --> 1540.5
it has to we need that we're under

1535.04 --> 1543.1399999999999
attack so we need that for survival for

1540.5 --> 1544.76
guidance for stability in the crazy

1543.14 --> 1546.95
world that constantly tries to

1544.76 --> 1549.83
manipulate you with everything and it's

1546.95 --> 1555.65
all about power and mind control that

1549.83 --> 1557.6899999999998
you need that foundation the truth

1555.65 --> 1559.3000000000002
becomes more important than any anything

1557.69 --> 1562.67
else

1559.3 --> 1565.8799999999999
not out of principle even but just to be

1562.67 --> 1569.8600000000001
able to keep an anchor in reality to

1565.88 --> 1569.8600000000001
withstand the mind-control attempts

1572.37 --> 1587.11
that talk about me fat hmm yeah hashtag

1580.33 --> 1590.83
NEFA yeah well it's it's basically just

1587.11 --> 1594.31
a gimmick and yeah you can use it

1590.83 --> 1599.8899999999999
however you like to address it so it can

1594.31 --> 1602.11
be a a question mark as in if you're

1599.89 --> 1603.9
that's kind of how it was intended in

1602.11 --> 1607.9299999999998
that sense it's more like a piece of art

1603.9 --> 1609.88
if you wear this it's very flashy it

1607.93 --> 1611.8600000000001
yeah especially if I'm gonna wear it

1609.88 --> 1615.16
because I wear all black and then having

1611.86 --> 1618.49
a freaking neon yellow had that like

1615.16 --> 1624.8500000000001
stands out like a like a police car

1618.49 --> 1627.01
light basically so yeah but people will

1624.85 --> 1629.62
be triggered to ask about it like what

1627.01 --> 1632.44
the [ __ ] is going on with that hat me

1629.62 --> 1635.62
five weirdoes MIFA and then you can size

1632.44 --> 1638.5900000000001
them up and say well make Europe free

1635.62 --> 1642.4499999999998
again you know they're just it look very

1638.59 --> 1644.62
stunned they're triggered person and

1642.45 --> 1647.14
yeah then you can get it what does that

1644.62 --> 1648.9099999999999
mean and then you can basically lay out

1647.14 --> 1650.98
what's going on and they might get

1648.91 --> 1653.5
triggered again and move your conspiracy

1650.98 --> 1655.38
theorist or a Nazi or or maybe they're

1653.5 --> 1660.4
like yeah you might not have a point

1655.38 --> 1662.38
all right in other cases people like

1660.4 --> 1666.4
conspiracy theories just walk start

1662.38 --> 1668.0200000000002
talking and then somebody yeah you get

1666.4 --> 1670.27
in a conversation and you figure out

1668.02 --> 1672.52
like ooh that these people know a lot

1670.27 --> 1674.59
and they might even bring Flat Earth up

1672.52 --> 1677.29
and then you ask him you know what this

1674.59 --> 1679.3899999999999
stands for its hat here yeah that crazy

1677.29 --> 1682.24
hat I always wanted to ask about that

1679.39 --> 1683.47
that hashtag meifa it stands for make

1682.24 --> 1687.7
earth flat again

1683.47 --> 1690.99
and it'll blow their minds so yeah

1687.7 --> 1690.99
multiple purposes

1691.81 --> 1699.31
and I've even figured out yeah I

1696.69 --> 1701.1100000000001
accidentally stumbled upon a piece of

1699.31 --> 1704.2
wizardry that you could even use it for

1701.11 --> 1710.5
and it's kind of terrible so definitely

1704.2 --> 1713.53
not only as a last resort now I'm not

1710.5 --> 1715.3
even gonna say it but there's just so

1713.53 --> 1718.06
many ways you can basically interpret

1715.3 --> 1719.59
those letters you can make it fit

1718.06 --> 1721.3899999999999
whatever you like there's a lot of

1719.59 --> 1725.23
things you can apply it from many

1721.39 --> 1727.69
different angles yeah I feel a burn aid

1725.23 --> 1731.6200000000001
elaborated on - I'll just leave the rest

1727.69 --> 1733.3300000000002
out for now somebody asked me on skype

1731.62 --> 1738.07
in private I'll share them and they'll

1733.33 --> 1749.9199999999998
know why probably better not to mention

1738.07 --> 1754.24
that in public anyway wizardry you know

1749.92 --> 1757.17
wizardry is just using your insight on

1754.24 --> 1760.8700000000001
the implications and effects of words

1757.17 --> 1764.38
it's a mastery the wizardry is a mastery

1760.87 --> 1766.8999999999999
but yeah wizardry has become colloquial

1764.38 --> 1769.93
eyes also by Owen Benjamin and other

1766.9 --> 1773.1100000000001
people as in spinning words around to

1769.93 --> 1779.0800000000002
basically apply confusion distraction

1773.11 --> 1783.9399999999998
and also peer pressure basically - yeah

1779.08 --> 1787.21
to conceal that that is what they say is

1783.94 --> 1789.4
wizardry but I yeah it's hard to call it

1787.21 --> 1792.3400000000001
Mesmer which is technically is it's like

1789.4 --> 1794.98
a subdivision even in the indie it's

1792.34 --> 1800.05
defined as such Mesmer to mesmerize to

1794.98 --> 1803.5
confuse to deflect the conscious the

1800.05 --> 1805.48
attention that's Mesmer mesmerizing

1803.5 --> 1807.97
that's why that word comes from Mesmer

1805.48 --> 1811.48
so but we'll it falls in wizardry but

1807.97 --> 1813.19
wizardry so much more but yeah I'm

1811.48 --> 1815.82
afraid I'm just gonna have to keep on

1813.19 --> 1818.95
clarifying that every single time it's

1815.82 --> 1821.08
it's going where it's going and yeah

1818.95 --> 1824.01
unfortunately I don't think I can

1821.08 --> 1827.1
basically make

1824.01 --> 1830.91
stop so wizardry will probably just be

1827.1 --> 1834.06
known as Mesmer when when you mention it

1830.91 --> 1836.13
in a sentence from now on unfortunately

1834.06 --> 1846.12
and I'll just have to clarify it every

1836.13 --> 1848.3700000000001
single time magic like gravity right now

1846.12 --> 1852.6
but from everything I've heard so far

1848.37 --> 1856.6799999999998
now chocolate it is pretty magical that

1852.6 --> 1861.4499999999998
gravity because gravity is an apparent

1856.68 --> 1867.1200000000001
force that is not a force but it's also

1861.45 --> 1870.75
the cause of a force so it's two things

1867.12 --> 1873.3899999999999
at the same time so it's actually

1870.75 --> 1877.2
basically comes down to it's an ethereal

1873.39 --> 1879.75
construct like a presuppositional

1877.2 --> 1881.78
parasite that's just latched on to there

1879.75 --> 1885.09
it has to be presupposed it's there and

1881.78 --> 1888.81
then it works that's what that explains

1885.09 --> 1891.3899999999999
to me and they just love it so much it's

1888.81 --> 1894.1499999999999
like an amoeba it's an ethereal amoeba

1891.39 --> 1896.3100000000002
like that's just there and it's like

1894.15 --> 1904.7900000000002
yeah it has to be there because it feels

1896.31 --> 1904.79
a great good that's gravity

1907.94 --> 1913.8500000000001
you have to presuppose it's there

1910.38 --> 1913.8500000000001
because it just it's too good

1919.65 --> 1926.7
so whatever gravity is to these ballers

1923.9 --> 1930.18
it has to be there because it's just too

1926.7 --> 1933.6000000000001
good not to be there well yeah as a

1930.18 --> 1935.64
result the explanations will be all over

1933.6 --> 1939.6599999999999
the place because it's technically not

1935.64 --> 1944.73
there so how do you define something

1939.66 --> 1947.6100000000001
that is technically not there in a sense

1944.73 --> 1953.07
that it makes it look like it is there

1947.61 --> 1956.4599999999998
well by basically yeah saying it is

1953.07 --> 1957.96
there but it's doing something else and

1956.46 --> 1960.08
that something else is the thing that

1957.96 --> 1962.52
you're going to be seeing its

1960.08 --> 1970.73
presuppositional structuring very

1962.52 --> 1973.73
persistent yellow can be and didn't star

1970.73 --> 1973.73
78

1973.92 --> 1976.979
[Music]

1980.89 --> 1985.17
room sarsen mb

1991.54 --> 2002.85
I am B I don't smoke hashish okay

1998.11 --> 2004.83
I smoke cannabis I don't mind smoking

2002.85 --> 2008.87
hashish though although it depends on

2004.83 --> 2011.8799999999999
the source because I want it to be pure

2008.87 --> 2017.1299999999999
because if it's like cheap version it's

2011.88 --> 2018.9
known that they basically use pig fat as

2017.13 --> 2022.44
part of the product and that's like

2018.9 --> 2026.72
disgusting but yeah I don't think that's

2022.44 --> 2026.72
even available in Netherlands anymore

2033.1 --> 2043.529
yeah now that that's not up for you to

2037.36 --> 2046.84
judge if that is logos or not logos okay

2043.529 --> 2051.159
you know the Rastafari thing completely

2046.84 --> 2057.8489999999997
different and besides has it really ever

2051.159 --> 2060.52
damaged anyone you know anything can be

2057.849 --> 2064.4700000000003
used to damage yourself if you want it

2060.52 --> 2067.21
to if you want to hide in it anything I

2064.47 --> 2069.73
mean even substances for that so if

2067.21 --> 2072.2400000000002
somebody's basically kind of like try to

2069.73 --> 2076.869
hide from reality by smoking himself

2072.24 --> 2078.669
into idiocy yeah that's a problem that's

2076.869 --> 2082.4190000000003
not logos but that doesn't mean that

2078.669 --> 2085.0499999999997
smoking per default is not logos that's

2082.419 --> 2085.0499999999997
ridiculous

2086.76 --> 2092.369
what however is not logos is if you are

2090.73 --> 2095.139
yeah

2092.369 --> 2095.77
addicted that at that part to that part

2095.139 --> 2099.46
I agree

2095.77 --> 2103.63
and it's careful dance and in a sense I

2099.46 --> 2106.42
am willing to admit that that yeah I've

2103.63 --> 2109.089
been smoking so much in my life that I

2106.42 --> 2111.609
definitely know I'm addicted to it like

2109.089 --> 2116.8289999999997
when I smoke but I also have long

2111.609 --> 2121.24
periods in between like I had a the five

2116.829 --> 2128.2000000000003
year stop complete stop zero contact

2121.24 --> 2130.5099999999998
zero smoking and it was fine it was

2128.2 --> 2135.5789999999997
really shitty and start but I can do

2130.51 --> 2139.329
that it's just I do things with it

2135.579 --> 2143.4100000000003
it does something to me it helps me put

2139.329 --> 2147.6090000000004
me in the zone as it were and it's not

2143.41 --> 2149.859
even that direct like to like the kick

2147.609 --> 2152.65
out of it like when you really get a

2149.859 --> 2154.39
fresh smoke no it's not that effect that

2152.65 --> 2157.27
does that it's actually everything

2154.39 --> 2162.609
afterward it yeah it just does something

2157.27 --> 2164.91
to the fluidity of of how I can see and

2162.609 --> 2164.91
think

2166.02 --> 2171.4
so I'm using it in that sense and and

2169.12 --> 2173.95
also yeah I could technically try to

2171.4 --> 2177.67
quit again but I don't know what will

2173.95 --> 2182.3799999999997
happen to my performance here on the

2177.67 --> 2184.98
show and my motivation because that also

2182.38 --> 2184.98
alters

2193.7 --> 2200.5
okay and be enough the I'm getting kind

2196.819 --> 2200.5
of sick of this don't patronize me

2201.73 --> 2210.89
okay goodbye all right you don't have to

2207.109 --> 2215.93
you don't have to be a dick okay

2210.89 --> 2216.5299999999997
I I didn't even say I can stop anytime I

2215.93 --> 2221.4199999999996
want

2216.53 --> 2226.4
I said I have I have proof of that some

2221.42 --> 2228.6800000000003
record five years and in those five

2226.4 --> 2231.71
years I wasn't lies always looking

2228.68 --> 2235.339
around if I could see or smell that no I

2231.71 --> 2237.53
really stepped away from it I can do

2235.339 --> 2240.859
that I well I could do that

2237.53 --> 2243.02
but to do it now yeah it what it did

2240.859 --> 2245.99
even back then I had the opportunity to

2243.02 --> 2249.7599999999998
basically decide that and I had the room

2245.99 --> 2252.89
to grunt it out the difficulties and

2249.76 --> 2255.7700000000004
switch into something new and that's

2252.89 --> 2260.66
always essential every time you your

2255.77 --> 2264.22
quit for serious but I'm in the middle

2260.66 --> 2267.35
of a process right now here this show

2264.22 --> 2267.35
[Music]

2278.26 --> 2285.28
all right yeah I do smoke with tobacco

2280.76 --> 2285.28
but I don't smoke tobacco separately I

2285.61 --> 2294.55
really dislike that I I can do it

2289.67 --> 2297.6800000000003
sometimes like well let's just say if I

2294.55 --> 2299.69
if I had nothing to smoke like cannabis

2297.68 --> 2301.6699999999996
there's no way or I just felt like no

2299.69 --> 2303.44
I'm not gonna do it today because I've

2301.67 --> 2307.21
overdue I've been overdoing it I need a

2303.44 --> 2311.84
break for a while to let it all sink

2307.21 --> 2316.88
then I might smoke like a Biggles

2311.84 --> 2322.34
self-made cigarette thing but I don't

2316.88 --> 2325.9
really like it but the thing is when I

2322.34 --> 2329.27
combine it to back up with cannabis

2325.9 --> 2332.03
it makes the taste a lot more better to

2329.27 --> 2335.48
me I like it better and I like the

2332.03 --> 2338.03
effect it has that's like I only really

2335.48 --> 2341.09
started smoking tobacco again what is it

2338.03 --> 2343.63
not two years ago with cannabis because

2341.09 --> 2348.59
before that I just smoked cannabis raw

2343.63 --> 2351.65
and it didn't have a very good influence

2348.59 --> 2354.59
on me it's just too much it hits too

2351.65 --> 2359.21
heavy that way and with with tobacco it

2354.59 --> 2363.55
it it's much more subtle so that's

2359.21 --> 2363.55
basically why I I still use tobacco

2366.8 --> 2373.4900000000002
but just smoking just smoking tobacco I

2370.46 --> 2376.28
don't like it because it it closes off

2373.49 --> 2378.41
my my veins and it makes my hands and

2376.28 --> 2383.15
feet cold and everything I died I don't

2378.41 --> 2385.3599999999997
like smoking just like that I just don't

2383.15 --> 2385.36
like it

2407.47 --> 2410.9199999999996
hello Jessica

2430.23 --> 2433.88
yeah sure

2440.03 --> 2465.44
[Music]

2453.64 --> 2469.339
hello hey how you doing yeah doing good

2465.44 --> 2472.309
I had a a Troyan earlier it's really

2469.339 --> 2475.509
weird it was just like oh you got to

2472.309 --> 2479.809
stop smoking cannabis so it's not logos

2475.509 --> 2481.46
and kept on like okay to just make that

2479.809 --> 2484.2200000000003
statement okay sure but you'd like to

2481.46 --> 2489.2
start it spamming it it's just annoying

2484.22 --> 2491.089
I don't understand what people just have

2489.2 --> 2493.1299999999997
nothing else to do it's just it's so sad

2491.089 --> 2495.0789999999997
it's really sad I did try to find a

2493.13 --> 2498.079
vulnerability and exploit it

2495.079 --> 2500.0890000000004
that's what trolls do and hey it's

2498.079 --> 2503.7200000000003
reasonable because I have doubts about

2500.089 --> 2505.7
like cannabis use it is something you

2503.72 --> 2512.0589999999997
need to be careful with well at least

2505.7 --> 2514.0389999999998
some people like me oh yeah that's what

2512.059 --> 2516.1090000000004
everything like even like even stuff

2514.039 --> 2519.23
that is good for you that can help you

2516.109 --> 2521.359
you still too much of anything is bad so

2519.23 --> 2523.579
of course there's there's something that

2521.359 --> 2525.8289999999997
you shouldn't have it all just like just

2523.579 --> 2527.69
keep that on your system period but like

2525.829 --> 2530.6600000000003
too much of anything even if it's a good

2527.69 --> 2534.259
thing like can now have negative effects

2530.66 --> 2536.239
on your body so all right well cannabis

2534.259 --> 2538.64
is not gonna have a negative effects on

2536.239 --> 2541.309
your body never had real negative

2538.64 --> 2544.97
effects although yeah if you like keep

2541.309 --> 2546.829
on pumping the smoke really heavily or

2544.97 --> 2548.359
like make this mega join or something

2546.829 --> 2552.289
start smoke yeah eventually at some

2548.359 --> 2554.66
point you will be full of the irregular

2552.289 --> 2557.15
sensation and then it'll start to pile

2554.66 --> 2561.109
up and then you you literally start to

2557.15 --> 2563.48
feel your mental faculties move away and

2561.109 --> 2565.279
you just can't recall and that's not

2563.48 --> 2566.839
damaged although yeah if you've never

2565.279 --> 2569.45
experienced that before it almost feels

2566.839 --> 2571.839
like oh my god I'm stupid now and you'll

2569.45 --> 2576.319
not be sure if you ever get it back

2571.839 --> 2581.3289999999997
yeah but you do you always do with

2576.319 --> 2583.3089999999997
cannabis cannabis only yes it's very

2581.329 --> 2585.29
weird especially like a first couple of

2583.309 --> 2587.03
times you try it and you overdo it you

2585.29 --> 2590.9
can panic from that [ __ ] because it

2587.03 --> 2592.0690000000004
lived oh my god I'm gonna die I can go

2590.9 --> 2594.079
yeah please

2592.069 --> 2596.66
but there's never a permanent damage

2594.079 --> 2598.4900000000002
it's never been recorded in history the

2596.66 --> 2600.8289999999997
only way permanent damage could happen

2598.49 --> 2603.2
is it basically you panic you start to

2600.829 --> 2605.599
stumble around and and then like fall

2603.2 --> 2609.109
over or something you hit your head

2605.599 --> 2612.05
that's like the only way ever damage is

2609.109 --> 2615.92
gonna be attained through overly use of

2612.05 --> 2618.53
cannabis right right and that makes it

2615.92 --> 2621.71
like it's but it's overall it's just a

2618.53 --> 2624.6800000000003
it's a relaxed or like it it did takes

2621.71 --> 2627.8
here it does a lot of very very

2624.68 --> 2629.48
beneficial things like it stops on even

2627.8 --> 2633.9500000000003
like for people a certain type of them

2629.48 --> 2636.2
oh my god I heard um so like oh well not

2633.95 --> 2639.4399999999996
one of my friends like her grandmother

2636.2 --> 2641.66
had um also had like a like dementia she

2639.44 --> 2644.569
would have certain spills and everything

2641.66 --> 2646.25
like that but she would on give her a

2644.569 --> 2648.2599999999998
cannabis note calmer down of court like

2646.25 --> 2651.799
she didn't smoke it she just yet she put

2648.26 --> 2653.78
it in like cheese mm-hmm oh there's like

2651.799 --> 2655.309
that she just it calmed her down like

2653.78 --> 2659.48
she wouldn't have those episodes for

2655.309 --> 2661.849
like a very long time so like that's

2659.48 --> 2663.47
that's you know really assists it helps

2661.849 --> 2665.3590000000004
with a lot of different penance it stops

2663.47 --> 2669.41
seizures like they're people like oh

2665.359 --> 2671.8089999999997
it's this yep it's a very beneficial

2669.41 --> 2674.69
plant it's just that the way that I

2671.809 --> 2676.549
guess people have such a negative

2674.69 --> 2677.9900000000002
connotation on it because of the way

2676.549 --> 2681.29
that it's marketed because the weight is

2677.99 --> 2684.049
portrayed in the media even like it's

2681.29 --> 2686.66
always you say we just oh my god but

2684.049 --> 2689.48
people just say you know because of the

2686.66 --> 2692.569
legal restrictions on it and it's also

2689.48 --> 2696.29
portrayed as a bad thing in media rights

2692.569 --> 2700.94
but it wakes your weekend or hang on the

2696.29 --> 2702.38
drugs basically for exploit and the dope

2700.94 --> 2705.2000000000003
but this is a thing they're still giving

2702.38 --> 2707.78
you that like the ones that

2705.2 --> 2709.46
are actually bad they'll give those to

2707.78 --> 2711.86
you without like and they'll be like oh

2709.46 --> 2715.2200000000003
whoa this is okay and inserted and it's

2711.86 --> 2717.35
like no this but like with like with

2715.22 --> 2720.1699999999996
can't like you still don't have that

2717.35 --> 2722.18
same negativity that same connotation

2720.17 --> 2723.2000000000003
because it's not being marketed the same

2722.18 --> 2726.83
way it's not being presented the same

2723.2 --> 2728.87
way okay so it's just it's stupid I mean

2726.83 --> 2732.3199999999997
let me not say stupid but it's plana

2728.87 --> 2734.99
it's very deceptive well yeah like I use

2732.32 --> 2737.36
more I'm the same stupid fern I was

2734.99 --> 2739.31
thanks to put too much some wings he's a

2737.36 --> 2743.96
different yeah that's discard withdrawal

2739.31 --> 2746.21
symptoms I think yeah like let go I

2743.96 --> 2749.18
wasn't on the server anymore but there

2746.21 --> 2750.62
was someone who I was talking to I'm not

2749.18 --> 2753.08
gonna reveal their name but I was

2750.62 --> 2756.38
talking to them and they're very very

2753.08 --> 2757.61
like like it like they were nice to me

2756.38 --> 2759.2000000000003
and everything like that so I was like

2757.61 --> 2761.51
okay I'll gets first it but they're so

2759.2 --> 2763.91
indoctrinated it's crazy it's not even

2761.51 --> 2765.4100000000003
the type of indoctrination that other

2763.91 --> 2767.45
globus have they're really really

2765.41 --> 2769.7599999999998
embedded with the math and in the quote

2767.45 --> 2773.06
unquote pseudo llevaba say pseudoscience

2769.76 --> 2775.5800000000004
of the globe this person just believes

2773.06 --> 2779.11
it and they just don't know what else to

2775.58 --> 2781.37
do and it's like it didn't even after um

2779.11 --> 2784.58
even after like what was shown yesterday

2781.37 --> 2786.65
I was like you know it's like it's like

2784.58 --> 2788.0299999999997
don't you you know and it was kind of it

2786.65 --> 2791.33
was kind of a joke but at the same time

2788.03 --> 2792.4100000000003
it wasn't a joke yet they were still it

2791.33 --> 2793.8199999999997
was like everyone just kind of sort of

2792.41 --> 2795.5
ran for the hills and I was like what is

2793.82 --> 2798.59
wrong with you guys it didn't make any

2795.5 --> 2802.12
sense and I was like and then I saw this

2798.59 --> 2806.03
person and they were just like so it's

2802.12 --> 2809.21
there's a moral but they're demoralized

2806.03 --> 2812.5400000000004
but I trying to keep on the fight but

2809.21 --> 2814.13
they said basically like yeah they're

2812.54 --> 2818.11
kind of getting sick of it because

2814.13 --> 2820.76
they're they're feeling the pressure and

2818.11 --> 2824.03
they're basically just waiting for the

2820.76 --> 2825.59
sign from above to like yeah we we can

2824.03 --> 2834.11
stop it now because we're not winning

2825.59 --> 2836.21
this one yeah this is like what it but

2834.11 --> 2838.88
they'll never officially say that

2836.21 --> 2842.45
so it's always gonna be in like as a

2838.88 --> 2845.1800000000003
joke or in between tongue and cheek but

2842.45 --> 2846.89
they're still on top of everything the

2845.18 --> 2849.6189999999997
weird program there's still a human

2846.89 --> 2851.8689999999997
being that has like pressure and

2849.619 --> 2853.88
energies to deal with and yeah they're

2851.869 --> 2857.7200000000003
getting so much pressure because they

2853.88 --> 2860.15
can't really handle the fight and they

2857.72 --> 2863.569
kind of know it and they've delved off

2860.15 --> 2865.9100000000003
into some subverting strategies to to

2863.569 --> 2867.71
accommodate for that but they're still

2865.91 --> 2870.41
not really getting anywhere it's not

2867.71 --> 2874.309
really working and that's just really

2870.41 --> 2878.27
stressful so they would love to give it

2874.309 --> 2881.349
up but they're not gonna do that as long

2878.27 --> 2885.02
as yeah as long as authority is there to

2881.349 --> 2888.829
reinforce it basically say know that it

2885.02 --> 2893.599
is a glow that stops then there's a lot

2888.829 --> 2895.19
of them that it'll give it up and that

2893.599 --> 2897.349
they may still believe it's a glow but

2895.19 --> 2901.51
they'll just retract it to a personal

2897.349 --> 2901.51
belief and just go away from it all

2902.74 --> 2910.7799999999997
that's what I think are you still there

2913.96 --> 2916.7400000000002
Jesse

2922.05 --> 2938.9700000000003
on hold okay she must be taking a phone

2931.86 --> 2941.9300000000003
call or something right so yeah it's a

2938.97 --> 2941.93
crazy world out there

2957.99 --> 2965.3199999999997
Lu I can hear something

2961.39 --> 2967.54
I'm so sorry did I like did I get cut

2965.32 --> 2972.1600000000003
out of the thing her it said you were in

2967.54 --> 2975.04
a call okay cool okay wait I thought

2972.16 --> 2977.71
that I was I should be more

2975.04 --> 2980.47
technologically on sounding this but I I

2977.71 --> 2984.4900000000002
was like oh my god am i I don't know you

2980.47 --> 2987.0699999999997
learn as she go that's how it works

2984.49 --> 2992.14
don't don't worry about it Oh obviously

2987.07 --> 2994.9300000000003
using the laptop so yeah cool but yet

2992.14 --> 2996.1
there was I saying yeah yeah it's just

2994.93 --> 2998.2
it's getting to the point where it's

2996.1 --> 2999.16
like really really at this point y'all

2998.2 --> 3002.97
are just gonna look like you're

2999.16 --> 3005.7
clinically insane at this point if you

3002.97 --> 3006.2999999999997
keep fighting this Froome but they

3005.7 --> 3009.0899999999997
already are

3006.3 --> 3011.2200000000003
they have been it's just gonna be that

3009.09 --> 3016.6800000000003
the wider public is gonna realize it

3011.22 --> 3019.62
more and more yeah like it was so funny

3016.68 --> 3021.8399999999997
cuz like this whole time Nathan was like

3019.62 --> 3024.63
so many questions about and nobody was

3021.84 --> 3030.03
talking the other was talking was um was

3024.63 --> 3033.23
which cut was done and it was so bad I

3030.03 --> 3036.9900000000002
was like oh come on

3033.23 --> 3040.71
it's a self-admitted religious globert

3036.99 --> 3042.5099999999998
so yeah he's he'd said that to me he was

3040.71 --> 3050.25
like yeah it's my belief system

3042.51 --> 3051.48
I don't like okay great yeah well you

3050.25 --> 3054.69
have one - I said I don't I don't

3051.48 --> 3057.18
believe any notice I don't believe

3054.69 --> 3060.15
anything but I'm gonna say that this is

3057.18 --> 3062.94
not a belief system me where my position

3060.15 --> 3067.23
is it's not a belief system lady now

3062.94 --> 3069.9900000000002
it's definitely not like you yeah no I

3067.23 --> 3072.14
definitely see a don threader like in

3069.99 --> 3074.16
five years just going door-to-door

3072.14 --> 3076.83
door-to-door and just like yeah would

3074.16 --> 3082.14
you like a book about the heliocentric

3076.83 --> 3084.48
system like it's really cool and

3082.14 --> 3085.75
fascinating and explains exactly how it

3084.48 --> 3091.03
all works

3085.75 --> 3092.56
we'll be legalized oh yeah yes I'm sure

3091.03 --> 3094.57
I think it will be a gift to me yeah

3092.56 --> 3097.06
it's not gonna do it anymore then there

3094.57 --> 3098.25
their religion is gone I have to do it

3097.06 --> 3108.0299999999997
the old-fashioned way

3098.25 --> 3110.53
the door the door but yeah this is so

3108.03 --> 3112.1800000000003
yeah that was funny I was cracking up

3110.53 --> 3116.9100000000003
the whole time what I did I couldn't

3112.18 --> 3120.16
stop laughing it was super funny

3116.91 --> 3124.31
yep yeah Dom Turner's one of the first

3120.16 --> 3127.3689999999997
officially helios witnesses

3124.31 --> 3127.369
[Music]

3128.8 --> 3132.9700000000003
I know it's just like they were they

3130.84 --> 3135.67
were still trying to say you know the

3132.97 --> 3136.24
same use the same things just didn't

3135.67 --> 3141.52
make any sense

3136.24 --> 3144.49
I'm just I just could yeah but you know

3141.52 --> 3147.64
it way like we were we're not like we're

3144.49 --> 3148.87
honestly you know that's just it there's

3147.64 --> 3150.5499999999997
really nothing else you can say

3148.87 --> 3154.24
and without that see that's the thing

3150.55 --> 3155.98
it's more than just okay so it's less so

3154.24 --> 3158.2
what it's like you do understand that

3155.98 --> 3160.81
this ends up messing up your entire

3158.2 --> 3164.02
rhetoric this is not just a oh well it's

3160.81 --> 3166.96
flat now it's like no everything else is

3164.02 --> 3169.12
connected to this sadly yeah but that's

3166.96 --> 3172.03
the core of their religion so it's not

3169.12 --> 3174.4
relevant if something derails it then it

3172.03 --> 3178.5400000000004
must be rejected that's how they think

3174.4 --> 3180.1800000000003
and you can't dissuade them from that so

3178.54 --> 3183.06
sad

3180.18 --> 3187.3199999999997
[Music]

3183.06 --> 3189.7
yes well but anyway the retort like I

3187.32 --> 3191.6200000000003
don't know I just I joined the show like

3189.7 --> 3196.89
were you talking about before I jumped

3191.62 --> 3199.21
on drugs

3196.89 --> 3203.17
rods makes it mostly because people

3199.21 --> 3205.7200000000003
started asking and they're asking do you

3203.17 --> 3208.39
take drugs no I grew cannabis or

3205.72 --> 3212.35
tobacco's and black basically explained

3208.39 --> 3215.5299999999997
like yeah I use it how I use it short

3212.35 --> 3220.7
background history and

3215.53 --> 3222.2900000000004
what yeah like I smoked weed like one

3220.7 --> 3225.3799999999997
time and that was it

3222.29 --> 3227.15
well I suppose we'd like one time and I

3225.38 --> 3228.9500000000003
don't think I did it right cuz my chest

3227.15 --> 3232.52
was burning for like three hours

3228.95 --> 3233.96
oh you did it right or right you

3232.52 --> 3236.39
probably was a little bit over

3233.96 --> 3240.7400000000002
enthusiastic but that's what happens

3236.39 --> 3243.02
especially the first time no I just I

3240.74 --> 3246.43
just sucked in I was kind I was anxious

3243.02 --> 3254.75
actually I was really this doesn't help

3246.43 --> 3256.46
yeah you gotta be kill and there's like

3254.75 --> 3257.72
the whole day I don't like all the other

3256.46 --> 3259.58
stuff that people are able to do with

3257.72 --> 3261.5899999999997
like this when they smoke I don't

3259.58 --> 3262.91
understand how that like how do you do

3261.59 --> 3265.79
that like people make it come out of

3262.91 --> 3267.98
their nose their make shapes and stuff

3265.79 --> 3270.71
like I don't how do you do this well

3267.98 --> 3273.2
first you Starla start off by letting

3270.71 --> 3277.16
your body get especially your lungs in

3273.2 --> 3279.29
your your yeah your cavities get used to

3277.16 --> 3280.97
the smoke exposure because that's the

3279.29 --> 3283.1
fur that's what you while you react so

3280.97 --> 3286.2799999999997
harsh the first time and gets all raw

3283.1 --> 3288.98
and painful but yeah if you subject

3286.28 --> 3293.38
yourself a couple of more times to it

3288.98 --> 3296.45
then your body won't overreact so much

3293.38 --> 3299.3
and then some people get so used to it

3296.45 --> 3302.5099999999998
that they can literally just like some

3299.3 --> 3305.3
people can use singing they can just use

3302.51 --> 3309.1090000000004
their breath and their cavities to just

3305.3 --> 3316.0
do tricks with it yeah bring it or ever

3309.109 --> 3321.95
I'm not to go into that but I did try it

3316.0 --> 3326.96
but no I'm not not good small the

3321.95 --> 3329.66
circles yeah like the only to like the

3326.96 --> 3331.46
only time I were probably like just

3329.66 --> 3332.96
smoke like maybe not even smoke just

3331.46 --> 3333.4700000000003
like the illusion of it like when I was

3332.96 --> 3336.17
little

3333.47 --> 3337.58
my grandfather my granddad had a pipe so

3336.17 --> 3340.58
when I was little I used to pretend I

3337.58 --> 3343.19
was looking out of the pipe and and like

3340.58 --> 3344.66
reading a book that's that'll be my

3343.19 --> 3346.369
whole thing like I would just I would

3344.66 --> 3348.35
just use a pipe instead of using the

3346.369 --> 3350.8700000000003
lifeboat rolled up saying

3348.35 --> 3353.06
like it's okay that can work but it's

3350.87 --> 3354.92
actually much rougher if you do it that

3353.06 --> 3357.71
way that's how my mother used to smoke

3354.92 --> 3362.0
through a pipe but what you do is you

3357.71 --> 3364.52
basically if you have a joint then the

3362.0 --> 3368.48
joint itself is also kind of a smell to

3364.52 --> 3370.21
smoke smoke filter and then yeah it

3368.48 --> 3372.41
becomes more and more basically

3370.21 --> 3375.08
contaminated by the filtered smoking

3372.41 --> 3376.94
that just reignites with you but that

3375.08 --> 3378.38
effect especially for the first part of

3376.94 --> 3379.55
a joint it filters it out if you're

3378.38 --> 3383.78
gonna smoke through a pipe you're

3379.55 --> 3385.8500000000004
basically gonna directly inhale that raw

3383.78 --> 3388.3300000000004
smoke without any filter in between it's

3385.85 --> 3391.48
pretty hardcore if you do it like that

3388.33 --> 3396.58
mmm unless you're gonna use a vaporizer

3391.48 --> 3399.62
then there's gonna be no smoke right

3396.58 --> 3402.65
doesn't make sense make sense yeah

3399.62 --> 3407.5699999999997
there's a lot of technical issues with

3402.65 --> 3411.83
the Costa smoking yep but pipes can be

3407.57 --> 3415.96
very interesting but I like pipes more

3411.83 --> 3415.96
for tobacco really though yeah

3426.45 --> 3435.2889999999998
you see my own I don't say we didn't

3431.91 --> 3440.069
turn on you yeah it's in there huh oh

3435.289 --> 3443.2400000000002
yeah uh see I'm on my phone so I can't I

3440.069 --> 3446.7
can't see the video all right

3443.24 --> 3450.0589999999997
I don't smell cannabis in it because it

3446.7 --> 3456.39
will also ruin kind of like the the wood

3450.059 --> 3458.19
it's in oh I see I really yeah I

3456.39 --> 3461.7599999999998
originally bought bought bought it as a

3458.19 --> 3468.48
prop press so idiotic idea for a

3461.76 --> 3472.529
live-action role-playing character know

3468.48 --> 3475.14
what I do okay use it like that like

3472.529 --> 3476.91
this is style of the matter Lula even if

3475.14 --> 3479.16
you're not smoking anything just holding

3476.91 --> 3482.25
one your mouth just looks really cool to

3479.16 --> 3484.44
me you know you have those characters I

3482.25 --> 3486.09
don't like that just it looks like

3484.44 --> 3489.079
