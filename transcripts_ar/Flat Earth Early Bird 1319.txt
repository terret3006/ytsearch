yeah uh there's been some Trails left

106.259 --> 112.259
and they kind of turn into this

109.2 --> 115.38
foggy like Cloud up there

112.259 --> 118.32
there's very little wind

115.38 --> 120.6
because yesterday yeah well it ended up

118.32 --> 122.52
like a really clear night even like

120.6 --> 123.53999999999999
really clear it was no moon out by the

122.52 --> 128.54
way

123.54 --> 128.54000000000002
very nice bright star sky

129.479 --> 133.02
but yeah right now it's a bit hazy up

132.06 --> 136.31900000000002
there

133.02 --> 139.58
and there is not a lot of wind

136.319 --> 139.57999999999998
still warm though

154.62 --> 160.4
hmm

157.14 --> 164.04
hello jado first in chat good to see you

160.4 --> 166.5
raised by gypsies Mike's lunich Neil

164.04 --> 169.79999999999998
deGrasse Tyson lies

166.5 --> 174.3
good to see you all it is Saturday the

169.8 --> 174.3
30th of July 2022

183.78 --> 188.58
all right it's been a long time for a

186.48 --> 191.57999999999998
change that isn't that just something

188.58 --> 191.58
anyway

197.599 --> 201.379
uh let's see

202.98 --> 205.7
correct

206.099 --> 212.79999999999998
hello PJ CNET good to see you

209.69 --> 212.8
[Music]

214.14 --> 216.73899999999998
ha

217.739 --> 222.0
that was quick wasn't it

220.92 --> 225.17999999999998
yeah

222.0 --> 228.319
like managing the windows here on my

225.18 --> 228.31900000000002
desktop in order to

229.2 --> 233.39999999999998
still me see my sound whether that's

231.78 --> 236.819
going

233.4 --> 238.26000000000002
and my camera and be able to reactivate

236.819 --> 242.04
it quickly

238.26 --> 244.57999999999998
and my chat and my live stream

242.04 --> 244.57999999999998
video

244.98 --> 247.51899999999998
ha

248.819 --> 251.48
anyway

253.92 --> 257.299
let's check the temperature

258.54 --> 262.699
like it's in the 20s for sure

263.4 --> 267.08
yeah 24 degrees Celsius

273.71 --> 276.89
[Music]

279.3 --> 284.28000000000003
oh okay according to the predictions

282.36 --> 286.74
it's gonna kind of rain

284.28 --> 290.88
Sunday Monday and then Wednesday it's

286.74 --> 293.16
going to get 29 degrees Celsius again

290.88 --> 296.28
and then it's kind of cooling off and

293.16 --> 299.639
raining again so right

296.28 --> 302.84
it's up and down cycle going

299.639 --> 302.84000000000003
seems very doable

303.539 --> 308.84
right anyway I got some green tea even

305.82 --> 308.84
though it is kind of warm

310.68 --> 314.1
and

312.419 --> 317.52
I saw them

314.1 --> 319.91900000000004
thought I want this so I got no

317.52 --> 323.78
blueberries

319.919 --> 323.78
thought it was good to do that again

328.139 --> 330.979
and they're great

331.74 --> 334.699
very big

341.94 --> 345.74
high in antioxidants yes

352.68 --> 356.759
although I'd also have vitamin C

354.78 --> 359.4
supplements so don't think I

356.759 --> 361.38
particularly need it it's just that

359.4 --> 363.479
the natural

361.38 --> 366.9
[Music]

363.479 --> 367.919
version a non-supplemented refined

366.9 --> 371.17999999999995
version

367.919 --> 371.18
is good for a change

373.62 --> 379.22
so you get more of that living energy

384.72 --> 389.28000000000003
right

386.699 --> 391.02000000000004
so yeah yesterday's show

389.28 --> 393.05999999999995
great

391.02 --> 394.85999999999996
very happy with I haven't watched it

393.06 --> 398.18
back but I probably should because I

394.86 --> 398.18
think it was a really good show

405.0 --> 410.88
also basically bumped into how

408.06 --> 413.039
parts of my symbolic site were just not

410.88 --> 416.039
properly updated

413.039 --> 419.15999999999997
like I had to come up with pretty good

416.039 --> 422.699
ideas since

419.16 --> 425.28000000000003
but yeah since the editor kind of broke

422.699 --> 427.44
I haven't really done anything with it

425.28 --> 428.099
and it's just kind of the way it used to

427.44 --> 431.28
be

428.099 --> 434.4
but even though the ideas have expanded

431.28 --> 437.46
in some fronts definitely

434.4 --> 441.12
so yeah that's a bit weird

437.46 --> 442.68
and disappointing you could say

441.12 --> 444.36
all right but I'm always here to

442.68 --> 446.52
basically explain it

444.36 --> 447.599
and that's what I did yesterday it's a

446.52 --> 449.69899999999996
good show

447.599 --> 452.71999999999997
right also Flat Earth debates were great

449.699 --> 452.72
very long show

453.12 --> 457.46
again

455.22 --> 457.46000000000004
foreign

462.199 --> 467.90000000000003
gets it

464.28 --> 467.9
got on in the after show

468.12 --> 476.94
and that went complete ape [ __ ]

473.4 --> 480.23999999999995
he just went full on Ken wheeler on us

476.94 --> 481.919
and then Paul savonia it was really a

480.24 --> 484.56
terrible display

481.919 --> 488.78
from his part

484.56 --> 488.78000000000003
I thought that Nathan was very Gallant

488.819 --> 495.84000000000003
for a very long time when he was already

491.819 --> 498.3
like full-on Wheeling it huh they

495.84 --> 499.52
Wheeling it you know I hope you know

498.3 --> 502.5
what that means

499.52 --> 506.58
during the Techno Babble Loosely

502.5 --> 509.759
connected not really connected yeah

506.58 --> 513.06
keeping on talking you you can Wheeling

509.759 --> 515.039
it right Ken Wheeling it he's Wheeling

513.06 --> 517.4399999999999
it

515.039 --> 519.24
this is

517.44 --> 522.0
dang it need to see that well you're

519.24 --> 525.24
going to probably see that uh Sunday

522.0 --> 526.98
and otherwise Monday

525.24 --> 529.16
depending on what Nathan's Gonna Do With

526.98 --> 529.16
It

531.36 --> 535.38
but that was pretty heavy and

533.279 --> 537.6
interesting

535.38 --> 540.38
and everybody was really good in form

537.6 --> 543.1800000000001
there was this time there was no

540.38 --> 546.0
competitive tension

543.18 --> 549.92
so we were all really maybe it was

546.0 --> 549.92
because of which it right because

550.14 --> 553.1
it kind of

554.519 --> 559.44
is going to be very weird don't take it

556.74 --> 563.899
too little but the Bob Empire really it

559.44 --> 563.899
does kind of bring us all together again

564.06 --> 569.6999999999999
because we know there is this group that

566.399 --> 571.44
is just like acting against us it isn't

569.7 --> 573.779
really listening isn't really adapting

571.44 --> 578.4200000000001
to our findings

573.779 --> 578.42
which are very legitimate findings

579.12 --> 584.04
and they oppose us and because of facing

582.12 --> 586.92
somebody

584.04 --> 589.74
that is from that camp

586.92 --> 593.399
and they're basically representing that

589.74 --> 595.5600000000001
camp yeah we unify

593.399 --> 598.2
so we become less

595.56 --> 600.5999999999999
like a bunch of Rowdy dogs that are just

598.2 --> 603.48
sparring all the time and like oh wait

600.6 --> 605.519
oh yeah we're actually a unit this is

603.48 --> 610.22
that effect it's interesting you know

605.519 --> 610.22
there's subconscious social mechanic

610.56 --> 615.66
and we all feel it we can we in the

613.44 --> 617.6600000000001
group we can all feel it it's just not

615.66 --> 620.16
everybody

617.66 --> 622.74
receives it the same way with their

620.16 --> 625.4399999999999
Consciousness in the group but we all

622.74 --> 628.339
have the sensibility to feel it at least

625.44 --> 628.339
it's interesting

634.26 --> 637.98
on what which it which it might yeah me

636.839 --> 641.94
neither

637.98 --> 645.5
but I mean the guy does have energy

641.94 --> 645.5
and he does have confidence

645.839 --> 649.2600000000001
but

647.1 --> 650.7
I think that his overall attitude and

649.26 --> 652.62
there's not even like

650.7 --> 655.74
it's not even a bad thing but I think

652.62 --> 657.9590000000001
his overall attitude is much more like

655.74 --> 660.3
he's just re he's really good at

657.959 --> 662.64
representing

660.3 --> 666.3
certain speaking points

662.64 --> 669.959
right he's that type and he's good at it

666.3 --> 673.079
but that also means he just becomes part

669.959 --> 675.779
of group dynamics even when those group

673.079 --> 679.4399999999999
dynamics have like bad political

675.779 --> 681.8389999999999
situations on the social front

679.44 --> 684.0
so it just gets caught up in it even

681.839 --> 686.0400000000001
though that would technically be below

684.0 --> 687.54
his intellectual standard because he is

686.04 --> 690.3199999999999
a really smart guy

687.54 --> 690.3199999999999
naturally

704.76 --> 708.6
but yeah he gets dragged Along on this

707.04 --> 711.12
stuff and

708.6 --> 713.48
well yesterday's Flat Earth debate is

711.12 --> 713.48
what happens

716.22 --> 719.4590000000001
it's married to another flat earther

718.5 --> 721.74
really

719.459 --> 725.3599999999999
okay

721.74 --> 725.36
cool I guess

751.22 --> 755.899
[Music]

752.639 --> 755.899
right so that happened

757.62 --> 762.36
also watch the video this morning watch

760.56 --> 765.0
watch a whole bunch of videos by the way

762.36 --> 766.2
that I kind of skipped on yesterday but

765.0 --> 768.62
that turned out to be kind of

766.2 --> 768.62
interesting

771.12 --> 777.66
or Mr jeswick had this

774.54 --> 780.7199999999999
Dutch former protest response to like a

777.66 --> 782.16
Dutch guy working for the BBC that was I

780.72 --> 783.3000000000001
never seen that before but that was

782.16 --> 785.519
pretty cool

783.3 --> 789.06
just Snippets and

785.519 --> 792.0600000000001
so there John Thor

789.06 --> 796.4399999999999
and an interesting video with a lot of

792.06 --> 799.92
footage from the Antarctic Ice walls

796.44 --> 802.44
with some talk over it

799.92 --> 804.779
I left a little message

802.44 --> 808.98
because it yeah Eric Dubai was in there

804.779 --> 812.3389999999999
and basically reifying the disc again

808.98 --> 815.5790000000001
I I like Eric but it's really annoying

812.339 --> 818.399
that he that he always

815.579 --> 820.4399999999999
brings that out as a speaking point

818.399 --> 823.62
find that very annoying because it's

820.44 --> 825.899
just you don't know dude it's it's very

823.62 --> 829.04
likely that that's technically incorrect

825.899 --> 829.04
what he's describing

829.62 --> 832.699
but uh anyway

834.6 --> 840.3000000000001
I guess you could say that's like his

836.399 --> 841.68
speaking point when he talks to normies

840.3 --> 844.199
uh

841.68 --> 846.9799999999999
what else yeah and some not flat earth

844.199 --> 846.9799999999999
related video

847.38 --> 853.16
about recycled glass really interesting

854.76 --> 859.4399999999999
like

856.44 --> 862.9200000000001
I am all for recycling but I didn't know

859.44 --> 865.5
that it had basically developed this far

862.92 --> 867.74
it's very interesting like dude it is

865.5 --> 869.399
like really interesting

867.74 --> 871.38
[Music]

869.399 --> 873.959
pretty cool

871.38 --> 879.12
hey terre306

873.959 --> 882.779
he's a rapper too oh okay

879.12 --> 885.36
all right anyway these these Africa I

882.779 --> 888.12
think he's probably having a good life

885.36 --> 890.22
if I'd have to size it up

888.12 --> 892.199
with my empathy I'd say that he's

890.22 --> 893.5790000000001
actually a happier person than me on

892.199 --> 895.199
average

893.579 --> 897.5999999999999
because he's just

895.199 --> 900.3599999999999
he's yeah as they would say he is

897.6 --> 902.279
crushing it even though yesterday he

900.36 --> 904.6800000000001
just completely [ __ ] up and turned

902.279 --> 906.36
into savanye right so even if you're

904.68 --> 907.68
crushing it doesn't mean that you can't

906.36 --> 910.639
fall

907.68 --> 910.6389999999999
in the moment

912.959 --> 917.8199999999999
but uh yeah no I like with it even

915.839 --> 921.1990000000001
though he made a complete ass of himself

917.82 --> 921.1990000000001
yesterday on the after show

922.56 --> 928.9399999999999
ing huh nice

925.079 --> 928.9399999999999
well then he really is crushing it

931.019 --> 935.24
I think he'd be a very inspiring dad

935.639 --> 940.86
because just because of his energy

938.639 --> 943.44
anyway

940.86 --> 944.759
the listen at slow speed to his video

943.44 --> 947.759
sometimes

944.759 --> 950.4590000000001
really is he that hyperactive I mean he

947.759 --> 953.4590000000001
is a pretty quick talker but

950.459 --> 957.3599999999999
I mean he only gets super fast when he

953.459 --> 959.7199999999999
goes into techno Babble and Wheeler mode

957.36 --> 959.72
right

960.36 --> 965.16
but he doesn't always talk fast it's

963.18 --> 967.1389999999999
just that when he gets technical about

965.16 --> 968.88
something and then he gets

967.139 --> 972.38
kind of quick

968.88 --> 972.38
but so do I

975.06 --> 978.8599999999999
hey Rick back good to see you

979.43 --> 982.62
[Music]

984.68 --> 988.04
[Music]

990.42 --> 994.699
what's your fourth language what

999.48 --> 1005.36
okay yeah I totally get that I mean if

1002.42 --> 1006.8
you're not like really great at English

1005.36 --> 1010.899
yeah it's going to be difficult to

1006.8 --> 1015.38
follow techno battle it it usually is

1010.899 --> 1019.16
I happen to be like really good at it

1015.38 --> 1024.94
so I don't have trouble it like yeah my

1019.16 --> 1024.94
English is like almost equal to my Dutch

1025.16 --> 1031.52
but that's because I I was interested in

1027.74 --> 1032.78
English and trained it a lot at a very

1031.52 --> 1035.959
young age

1032.78 --> 1038.1789999999999
so I kind of always wanted to be I

1035.959 --> 1040.939
wanted English

1038.179 --> 1043.8190000000002
and that's really what made me that good

1040.939 --> 1049.1000000000001
at it you really have to want it

1043.819 --> 1049.1
and it has to be like your original idea

1054.679 --> 1059.48
I only speak English and I don't

1057.14 --> 1063.1000000000001
know all the words right well if yeah if

1059.48 --> 1063.1
you're just living in England

1063.38 --> 1067.1000000000001
it happens to be your language that

1065.24 --> 1069.44
doesn't automatically make you a great

1067.1 --> 1075.1399999999999
speaker you have to have training

1069.44 --> 1078.559
my parents were training me also

1075.14 --> 1080.96
in my in Dutch more in Dutch but I

1078.559 --> 1082.16
basically used their Dutch training the

1080.96 --> 1085.8400000000001
method of it

1082.16 --> 1085.8400000000001
for myself with English

1086.66 --> 1090.88
because I just really wanted it

1092.9 --> 1102.71
hello Aaron

1095.11 --> 1102.7099999999998
[Music]

1106.16 --> 1110.66
it's taught English since kindergarten

1108.02 --> 1112.46
yeah dude terror you're great you're

1110.66 --> 1114.14
great at English I'd say you're better

1112.46 --> 1116.66
than the average

1114.14 --> 1119.2990000000002
supposed English speaker telephone

1116.66 --> 1122.78
operator from India

1119.299 --> 1123.679
I bet you would be a lot better audibly

1122.78 --> 1125.1789999999999
too

1123.679 --> 1128.0590000000002
so

1125.179 --> 1128.96
no you have a very decent level for your

1128.059 --> 1132.08
age

1128.96 --> 1135.08
in English writing very very decent

1132.08 --> 1137.539
could get even better

1135.08 --> 1139.8999999999999
if you're that good at it already at

1137.539 --> 1139.9
this age

1139.94 --> 1143.0800000000002
but I'd say

1144.799 --> 1148.8799999999999
in a certain way you were you're

1146.48 --> 1150.559
probably just as good as I was at your

1148.88 --> 1153.14
age

1150.559 --> 1156.7
and I was pretty good

1153.14 --> 1156.7
then again I'm not Indian

1158.6 --> 1162.8799999999999
it's hard to compare it works

1160.4 --> 1162.88
differently

1180.5 --> 1184.34
lots of European word in English

1182.72 --> 1187.52
language yeah

1184.34 --> 1191.86
it was created on

1187.52 --> 1191.86
wrench Dutch German

1194.36 --> 1197.74
yeah mostly that

1198.86 --> 1204.74
now again yeah I was I I'm saying Dutch

1201.679 --> 1205.4
but Dutch is like right in the middle of

1204.74 --> 1207.86
it

1205.4 --> 1209.9
but yeah English has French and German

1207.86 --> 1212.74
and Dutch has

1209.9 --> 1212.74
those two

1227.62 --> 1233.539
Godzilla shut up

1229.76 --> 1233.539
that's just terrible

1246.38 --> 1250.46
right knees the grass Tyson well it's

1248.9 --> 1253.46
Saxon

1250.46 --> 1253.46
Anglo-Saxon

1263.24 --> 1267.74
English the worst language to think and

1265.34 --> 1269.4189999999999
discover truth with no absolutely not

1267.74 --> 1272.44
right back

1269.419 --> 1272.44
that's not true

1273.38 --> 1277.7
it is however

1275.419 --> 1281.0
the easiest language

1277.7 --> 1284.3600000000001
to make up Fiction with that's my

1281.0 --> 1286.0
finding it is extremely Dynamic when it

1284.36 --> 1289.8999999999999
comes to

1286.0 --> 1289.9
imaginary explanation

1290.179 --> 1295.96
it it helped me to assist in

1293.12 --> 1295.9599999999998
visualization

1297.02 --> 1301.58
I fell for a whole bunch of [ __ ] in

1299.659 --> 1304.8400000000001
English language does it mean that it's

1301.58 --> 1304.84
harder to find the truth

1306.74 --> 1311.24
foreign

1308.72 --> 1314.48
it's just easier to make [ __ ] up

1311.24 --> 1317.059
with this is so you're gonna bump into

1314.48 --> 1319.28
that right

1317.059 --> 1321.2
and this is the worst language ever now

1319.28 --> 1323.48
I disagree

1321.2 --> 1326.179
I think it's great

1323.48 --> 1329.96
it's extremely dynamic

1326.179 --> 1333.8600000000001
I mean you can't have every type

1329.96 --> 1336.02
good evil strong weak intelligible

1333.86 --> 1339.52
unintelligible

1336.02 --> 1339.52
in every combination

1344.96 --> 1352.78
it provides English provides it it was

1349.46 --> 1356.419
an imperial language it was a language

1352.78 --> 1359.6589999999999
designed to be able to rule the world to

1356.419 --> 1362.419
be everywhere and always have a place

1359.659 --> 1365.419
and I think it succeeded at it that's

1362.419 --> 1367.4
why it's kind of

1365.419 --> 1370.46
well

1367.4 --> 1372.5590000000002
in my opinion the world language

1370.46 --> 1375.919
now of course there's a whole bunch of

1372.559 --> 1379.58
countries out there and that will not

1375.919 --> 1381.98
agree to that I get that

1379.58 --> 1386.26
but English is the most widely

1381.98 --> 1386.26
understood language of all time

1405.57 --> 1408.77
[Music]

1418.1 --> 1421.1
foreign

1422.299 --> 1425.299
language

1426.559 --> 1432.2
in literature and

1429.32 --> 1433.22
and movies and all that just just look

1432.2 --> 1435.74
at it

1433.22 --> 1437.539
all these different cultures all

1435.74 --> 1440.72
represented

1437.539 --> 1442.84
all having their own English Style

1440.72 --> 1445.76
and like

1442.84 --> 1449.24
manifested enough for the entire world

1445.76 --> 1453.02
to actually learn about it

1449.24 --> 1456.32
I mean yeah I know for example

1453.02 --> 1458.779
in India there's like all these

1456.32 --> 1460.279
different provinces and like people in

1458.779 --> 1461.84
the north don't even look like the

1460.279 --> 1462.679
people in the South it's that freaking

1461.84 --> 1464.72
big

1462.679 --> 1467.24
and they have probably a giant history

1464.72 --> 1470.179
right and and I bet that India they know

1467.24 --> 1472.88
all about that but the outside world

1470.179 --> 1474.14
does not even though you have a

1472.88 --> 1476.419
Bollywood

1474.14 --> 1479.2990000000002
that's kind of pro that's almost

1476.419 --> 1480.919
prominent that it is prominent kind of

1479.299 --> 1482.6589999999999
I mean everybody knows there's a

1480.919 --> 1486.44
Bollywood that's something

1482.659 --> 1489.14
but through English media like everybody

1486.44 --> 1490.8200000000002
knows like wait Australia is completely

1489.14 --> 1492.6200000000001
different from England England is

1490.82 --> 1495.1399999999999
completely different from America Canada

1492.62 --> 1497.299
is even kind of different and then you

1495.14 --> 1500.9
also have Ireland and Scotland and then

1497.299 --> 1503.299
just look at England itself the north of

1500.9 --> 1505.94
England the south of England like when

1503.299 --> 1509.4189999999999
these people speak it doesn't even sound

1505.94 --> 1512.38
like the same language right and this is

1509.419 --> 1515.179
relatively widely known even by

1512.38 --> 1517.8200000000002
non-english speakers

1515.179 --> 1521.74
that have because it is available

1517.82 --> 1521.74
knowledge much more

1528.74 --> 1532.6
I love learning Japanese you learn

1531.44 --> 1535.7
Japanese

1532.6 --> 1539.0
that's really tough

1535.7 --> 1542.48
I wish I could speak Japanese I had some

1539.0 --> 1544.88
opportunity to try and learn it but

1542.48 --> 1547.46
my mind wasn't at it

1544.88 --> 1550.9
but I liked I just liked the way

1547.46 --> 1550.9
Japanese people speak

1551.419 --> 1555.6200000000001
it's not even what they're saying it's

1553.159 --> 1558.38
just the way they speak

1555.62 --> 1560.36
and what they end up saying and how they

1558.38 --> 1563.779
say it is really interesting

1560.36 --> 1567.1589999999999
so I like their syntax

1563.779 --> 1567.159
spiritual and lingual

1570.799 --> 1576.74
and also on top of that Japan has like

1574.279 --> 1579.02
the most embarrassing scored voice that

1576.74 --> 1581.9
the world has ever seen

1579.02 --> 1584.6
stick out with that as well

1581.9 --> 1586.5500000000002
I'd say as a contrast

1584.6 --> 1589.78
uh

1586.55 --> 1589.78
[Music]

1605.6 --> 1610.6999999999998
although America is definitely giving

1608.12 --> 1614.0
Japan a run for

1610.7 --> 1617.659
worst squirt boy of all time

1614.0 --> 1620.38
with some of its citizens

1617.659 --> 1620.38
for sure

1627.09 --> 1633.26
[Music]

1630.44 --> 1635.6000000000001
yeah poor Japanese I and I totally agree

1633.26 --> 1637.4
because freaking Japanese women seem

1635.6 --> 1641.0
like awesome

1637.4 --> 1642.5590000000002
like I know like dudes you Japan squirt

1641.0 --> 1645.44
boys do you even know what you're

1642.559 --> 1649.6589999999999
throwing away you lucky bastards you had

1645.44 --> 1654.2
like this cohesive homogeneous culture

1649.659 --> 1656.6000000000001
and genetics that like your

1654.2 --> 1660.14
Grand grandparents or whatever like

1656.6 --> 1662.7199999999998
fought fanatically to the death for and

1660.14 --> 1665.0
you're literally squirting in insane

1662.72 --> 1665.8990000000001
imagination land and you don't want your

1665.0 --> 1668.659
women

1665.899 --> 1671.4189999999999
and you have great women I'm kind of

1668.659 --> 1673.3990000000001
jealous sometimes not that I look would

1671.419 --> 1675.679
like to hook up with a Japanese woman

1673.399 --> 1678.02
but like

1675.679 --> 1680.659
they seem awesome

1678.02 --> 1683.2
like I don't get what what this guy's

1680.659 --> 1683.2
problem is

1685.399 --> 1691.6999999999998
I just maybe it's because I'm Japanese I

1688.76 --> 1693.14
don't get it uh

1691.7 --> 1695.74
whatever

1693.14 --> 1695.74
anyway

1700.35 --> 1711.319
[Music]

1716.24 --> 1720.08
you think they're yeah of course yeah

1718.1 --> 1721.6999999999998
but that that's pretty straightforward

1720.08 --> 1725.24
nearly grass Dyson lies that that

1721.7 --> 1727.419
happened through anime and porn and all

1725.24 --> 1727.419
that

1728.12 --> 1733.9599999999998
uh yeah thanks PJ Zenith for reminding

1730.64 --> 1733.96
us oh the goodie

1735.919 --> 1740.779
all right but for Thailand it's like an

1738.14 --> 1744.0200000000002
industry it's like literally an

1740.779 --> 1747.14
internationally known industry gross but

1744.02 --> 1749.4189999999999
that's why it is like Japan is not like

1747.14 --> 1751.5200000000002
that foreign industry they just have

1749.419 --> 1755.679
insane squirt boys

1751.52 --> 1761.299
and freaky television shows about

1755.679 --> 1764.96
marrying a virtual animated character

1761.299 --> 1766.1589999999999
or sex robots and [ __ ] like dude what

1764.96 --> 1768.7
the [ __ ] man

1766.159 --> 1771.2600000000002
why do you do that to your own people

1768.7 --> 1774.799
why do you like oh they have interest

1771.26 --> 1776.6589999999999
yes why are you doing that

1774.799 --> 1779.299
it's like oh yeah there's a particular

1776.659 --> 1781.0390000000002
High rate of suicide interest oh that's

1779.299 --> 1786.1399999999999
me let's make a lot of programs about

1781.039 --> 1787.58
suicide no no no no you should not do

1786.14 --> 1790.279
that

1787.58 --> 1792.3799999999999
I don't get it like some of these

1790.279 --> 1794.539
corporations

1792.38 --> 1798.5800000000002
I don't understand why they do that to

1794.539 --> 1798.58
their own public and why it's allowed

1799.22 --> 1804.74
I don't get it I mean I think that Japan

1802.1 --> 1807.4599999999998
should really like tighten up and get a

1804.74 --> 1809.8990000000001
bit more old-fashioned and just let this

1807.46 --> 1811.76
liberal insanity

1809.899 --> 1814.279
Let It Go

1811.76 --> 1816.7
it's pointless they're just going insane

1814.279 --> 1820.48
they're just going

1816.7 --> 1820.48
suicidal infertile

1820.84 --> 1825.74
delusional this is not good for you

1823.1 --> 1827.779
jivan and I bet a whole bunch of them

1825.74 --> 1831.94
know it

1827.779 --> 1831.94
anyway let's see what happens

1832.58 --> 1835.1789999999999
uh

1835.76 --> 1840.1
mute button that's my what

1844.94 --> 1849.52
for a fan of Latin okay

1873.5 --> 1878.299
yeah when it comes to that kind of

1875.539 --> 1880.1589999999999
nonsense PGC net virtual pop star

1878.299 --> 1883.1
hologram

1880.159 --> 1886.48
is like Japan still has a competitor in

1883.1 --> 1886.48
South Korea like that

1888.2 --> 1891.82
because they do it also

1894.74 --> 1899.8990000000001
they're South Korea is very fanatical

1897.86 --> 1903.8799999999999
about computer games and the virtual

1899.899 --> 1903.8799999999999
things virtual events

1906.399 --> 1910.1789999999999
are down low yeah

1913.76 --> 1918.74
how often do you guys see pregnant women

1915.94 --> 1921.6200000000001
you'd be surprised Rick back I actually

1918.74 --> 1924.22
thank God literally I see a lot of

1921.62 --> 1924.2199999999998
pregnant women

1924.26 --> 1927.8799999999999
and yeah

1928.7 --> 1934.519
especially a lot of I've seen a lot of

1931.88 --> 1937.8200000000002
pregnant blonde women and I really like

1934.519 --> 1940.279
that even though there's not my babies

1937.82 --> 1942.6399999999999
but yeah no I see plenty of pregnant

1940.279 --> 1942.64
women

1943.159 --> 1946.72
so they're still out there

1949.1 --> 1955.039
also like mothers that go around with

1952.22 --> 1956.0
like three kids and all that I'm seeing

1955.039 --> 1957.679
that too

1956.0 --> 1960.74
so

1957.679 --> 1964.039
it seems like the the population here

1960.74 --> 1966.26
locally does seem to keep going it's not

1964.039 --> 1968.6589999999999
that bad

1966.26 --> 1970.82
or maybe a lot of them just got like

1968.659 --> 1972.919
wait this is going wrong we don't want

1970.82 --> 1975.799
to be all replaced by migrants let's

1972.919 --> 1979.8400000000001
make babies let's stop listening to this

1975.799 --> 1979.84
crazy overpopulation propaganda

1982.539 --> 1989.86
stillbirth uh

1984.98 --> 1989.8600000000001
yeah vaccine death birth I know

2022.019 --> 2027.94
lucky man Matthew Hall

2024.64 --> 2029.98
is yeah I'm kind of envious

2027.94 --> 2032.22
that you even have a big family like

2029.98 --> 2032.22
that

2034.659 --> 2038.74
I used to have like a decent sized

2037.12 --> 2041.08
family and then a whole bunch of them

2038.74 --> 2042.45
died and then it all just fragmented and

2041.08 --> 2045.039
we all drifted apart

2042.45 --> 2045.69
[Music]

2045.039 --> 2047.44
yeah

2045.69 --> 2051.06
[Music]

2047.44 --> 2051.06
but it wasn't really a big family

2051.399 --> 2057.6389999999997
it's like a whole bunch of

2054.879 --> 2061.06
yeah we're all like families of people

2057.639 --> 2064.179
that have two kids that's yeah that's

2061.06 --> 2068.7599999999998
except from from My Father's Side

2064.179 --> 2068.76
like my father has three brothers

2079.419 --> 2082.0789999999997
wow

2087.879 --> 2092.2799999999997
goodness and sets what

2095.919 --> 2098.6389999999997
what does that mean

2099.86 --> 2103.039
[Music]

2121.119 --> 2125.579
right yeah it is Matthew Hall

2155.859 --> 2158.5789999999997
foreign

2168.66 --> 2171.7799999999997
in here

2181.9 --> 2188.82
hey steemit Traveler

2184.0 --> 2188.82
yeah no particular subjects today

2194.92 --> 2199.9
we were talking about English in media

2198.339 --> 2202.0
and

2199.9 --> 2206.099
now we're talking about birth rates

2202.0 --> 2206.099
apparently and big families and all that

2219.76 --> 2223.8390000000004
oh yeah and we also had a part about

2221.44 --> 2227.38
yesterday's fvd

2223.839 --> 2232.2
which it gets it came on

2227.38 --> 2232.2000000000003
and kind of went out of hand a bit

2235.96 --> 2239.579
went Ken wheeler on us

2250.74 --> 2255.1189999999997
but yeah I'm doing pretty good

2257.859 --> 2261.16
just

2259.0 --> 2264.04
spend a ton of money

2261.16 --> 2266.56
on supplements but I really needed them

2264.04 --> 2268.96
and it was like with a pretty big

2266.56 --> 2271.54
discount which is very rare

2268.96 --> 2274.48
and that literally that discount saved

2271.54 --> 2277.24
me 25 Euros

2274.48 --> 2279.599
like I had to do that

2277.24 --> 2279.5989999999997
what

2280.42 --> 2286.839
now I have literally an entire season's

2284.2 --> 2288.9399999999996
worth of supplements of these

2286.839 --> 2292.72
spirulina

2288.94 --> 2292.7200000000003
an astaxentine

2293.14 --> 2299.7999999999997
very yeah supplements that have

2295.599 --> 2303.06
definitely proven their Worth to me

2299.8 --> 2303.0600000000004
done very well

2308.98 --> 2315.22
Ken wheeler how yes now it it was with

2312.76 --> 2318.28
it but look I just say

2315.22 --> 2321.2799999999997
somebody's go doing a Ken wheeler that

2318.28 --> 2325.0
means they're going to use Ken Wheeler's

2321.28 --> 2327.7000000000003
method of techno babbling

2325.0 --> 2330.06
doing a wheelie

2327.7 --> 2333.46
just quick

2330.06 --> 2335.619
seemingly cohesive but not completely

2333.46 --> 2337.0
connecting it's just an endlessly going

2335.619 --> 2339.94
spiral

2337.0 --> 2341.74
it doesn't actually lead to any definite

2339.94 --> 2344.2000000000003
conclusion it's just a lot of

2341.74 --> 2348.4599999999996
correlations basically

2344.2 --> 2348.46
and virtual presuppositions

2348.52 --> 2355.56
so that's doing it

2351.16 --> 2355.56
that's doing a wheelie I would say

2356.079 --> 2359.46
doing a wheelie

2367.839 --> 2373.44
like the suicide roller coaster [ __ ]

2370.78 --> 2373.44
what

2375.46 --> 2380.7
I don't know

2377.38 --> 2380.7000000000003
that roller coaster

2382.98 --> 2388.42
aggressively smaller Loops I

2385.839 --> 2392.44
oh that's nasty

2388.42 --> 2395.44
oh that's gonna like like squish you if

2392.44 --> 2398.56
you do that move

2395.44 --> 2400.42
yeah that's dude you should not be

2398.56 --> 2402.94
having your neck loose when that happens

2400.42 --> 2404.7400000000002
you should definitely have it stuck very

2402.94 --> 2408.42
hard to the Sea

2404.74 --> 2408.4199999999996
that sounds pretty [ __ ]

2410.2 --> 2414.48
is there actually a roller coaster like

2412.24 --> 2414.4799999999996
that

2422.74 --> 2426.24
hello Como virus

2440.29 --> 2444.469
[Music]

2448.3 --> 2453.3390000000004
blueberry

2450.819 --> 2457.54
it was designed on paper okay but they

2453.339 --> 2460.38
didn't actually build it we

2457.54 --> 2460.38
blueberry

2461.42 --> 2471.37
[Music]

2484.24 --> 2489.839
it does kind of sound interesting though

2486.64 --> 2489.839
it would be like a

2490.54 --> 2493.7799999999997
I don't know why I'm talking about a

2492.16 --> 2496.74
roller coasters now

2493.78 --> 2496.7400000000002
it would be like

2500.56 --> 2507.88
a water torrent is that the word

2503.12 --> 2511.25
[Music]

2507.88 --> 2513.099
now I'm done

2511.25 --> 2516.359
[Music]

2513.099 --> 2516.3590000000004
stupid suggestion

2521.859 --> 2524.4
no

2525.16 --> 2534.8199999999997
foreign

2526.21 --> 2534.82
[Music]

2537.04 --> 2543.579
what

2538.66 --> 2546.3999999999996
water swirl that sounds stupid

2543.579 --> 2549.819
in Dutch it sounds a lot more impressive

2546.4 --> 2552.099
like a big water

2549.819 --> 2553.9
spiral down right

2552.099 --> 2556.3590000000004
I think there's like movies of that and

2553.9 --> 2558.76
it's like going down the drain or if you

2556.359 --> 2561.88
could have like a

2558.76 --> 2565.5400000000004
a roller coaster that is like that dude

2561.88 --> 2569.319
you could even have like water

2565.54 --> 2571.42
underneath the roller coaster doing like

2569.319 --> 2573.64
sort of almost like a tornado this is

2571.42 --> 2577.66
actually a really interesting idea

2573.64 --> 2580.24
that the roller coaster like goes down

2577.66 --> 2583.96
and then starting big and then going

2580.24 --> 2586.4199999999996
down and tightening up tightening up and

2583.96 --> 2588.4
then eventually like it falling into the

2586.42 --> 2589.96
hole I mean that would be pretty

2588.4 --> 2591.94
freaking Epic

2589.96 --> 2593.619
and wouldn't necessarily have to be a

2591.94 --> 2596.079
neck breaker right it would be a neck

2593.619 --> 2598.06
breaker if you did like a if you did it

2596.079 --> 2600.3390000000004
vertical like that but if it was

2598.06 --> 2602.2
horizontal I think that would be

2600.339 --> 2605.44
freaking Epic

2602.2 --> 2608.14
especially if you do it like in a in

2605.44 --> 2610.839
like a funnel with water so that the

2608.14 --> 2612.8799999999997
roller coaster is above it

2610.839 --> 2615.04
and even going into the hole and while

2612.88 --> 2617.26
there is basically a water

2615.04 --> 2619.48
torrent

2617.26 --> 2622.5600000000004
around them I mean that would be

2619.48 --> 2622.56
freaking Epic Man

2622.66 --> 2629.74
I may have just given some yeah roller

2626.079 --> 2631.96
coaster designer a really good idea or

2629.74 --> 2634.1189999999997
maybe this is like a really good idea

2631.96 --> 2635.5
Arwin I came up with that when I was 12

2634.119 --> 2639.78
and

2635.5 --> 2639.78
in 82. oh okay

2641.859 --> 2645.54
I still think it's a good idea

2666.0 --> 2671.079
yeah that's gross

2668.92 --> 2673.42
dude I'm thinking I'm trying to think of

2671.079 --> 2676.8
cool fun things why did you have to drag

2673.42 --> 2676.8
death into it come on

2677.24 --> 2682.0
[Music]

2679.78 --> 2685.079
only cost would be pumping the water up

2682.0 --> 2685.079
no it wouldn't

2688.839 --> 2690.839
um

2697.9 --> 2701.98
it wouldn't necessarily even have to be

2700.359 --> 2704.38
that much water

2701.98 --> 2705.339
right if you just have at the top of the

2704.38 --> 2707.98
funnel

2705.339 --> 2709.24
you have like

2707.98 --> 2712.839
uh

2709.24 --> 2715.8999999999996
pipes that literally blast it

2712.839 --> 2718.18
into a circle shape doesn't yeah it's

2715.9 --> 2720.4
not like oh it's just a funnel and like

2718.18 --> 2723.339
a lot of water has to Free Fall no not

2720.4 --> 2726.579
like it has to like Spiral

2723.339 --> 2729.339
right then it's super epic then it's

2726.579 --> 2733.0
like oh my hell oh we're in a roller

2729.339 --> 2735.22
coaster and we're going down the drain

2733.0 --> 2739.5
it wouldn't have to be that much water

2735.22 --> 2739.5
even the pump I'd say

2751.9 --> 2756.1600000000003
that's right akumo virus and that's

2754.48 --> 2758.38
exactly right because because you

2756.16 --> 2761.92
wouldn't have to go like a devastating

2758.38 --> 2764.56
speed into the spiral to get that it

2761.92 --> 2767.8
doesn't need to even be that fast you

2764.56 --> 2769.7799999999997
could like because you don't have you

2767.8 --> 2771.46
need a certain speed build up to like go

2769.78 --> 2774.1600000000003
the loop right

2771.46 --> 2777.94
then you need that speed but if it's all

2774.16 --> 2780.16
horizontal you can technically Make It

2777.94 --> 2781.66
Go like a snail if you wanted to and

2780.16 --> 2784.42
then in the last moment it would be

2781.66 --> 2788.52
pulled down right

2784.42 --> 2788.52
so yeah it's much safer that way

2792.46 --> 2797.2
picturing much more water

2794.98 --> 2801.18
well Rick back there's trickery to just

2797.2 --> 2801.18
make it seem like it much more water

2801.94 --> 2804.54
right

2807.7 --> 2810.96
there's probably yeah

2811.599 --> 2816.52
I don't know it would have to be figured

2814.06 --> 2818.98
out test it like how much water is it

2816.52 --> 2820.54
gonna take before it actually looks like

2818.98 --> 2824.079
it could be like some sort of a

2820.54 --> 2826.72
waterfall like funnel situation

2824.079 --> 2828.94
you have to test that

2826.72 --> 2830.14
sounds cool yeah I know I'm really

2828.94 --> 2833.14
excited

2830.14 --> 2835.0
I want this roller coaster thing now

2833.14 --> 2838.0
in something

2835.0 --> 2840.76
but the thing is though like just the

2838.0 --> 2843.099
funnel tube drop

2840.76 --> 2845.3190000000004
that's not like a roller coaster that

2843.099 --> 2847.42
would be like one third of a roller

2845.319 --> 2849.22
coaster ride or something so if you're

2847.42 --> 2850.1800000000003
gonna have it like that well then make

2849.22 --> 2853.0589999999997
it

2850.18 --> 2855.24
try to make it like water park themed in

2853.059 --> 2855.2400000000002
general

2855.339 --> 2861.04
I mean there is like water park rides

2859.059 --> 2864.1600000000003
remember like where you go into those

2861.04 --> 2867.16
big tires

2864.16 --> 2871.92
and you just go yeah through like a

2867.16 --> 2871.92
waterfall ride and all that sort of

2872.079 --> 2876.4
well

2873.22 --> 2879.7799999999997
make it like that except a roller

2876.4 --> 2879.78
coaster is actually moving

2880.42 --> 2885.839
like a like a water park themed roller

2883.54 --> 2885.839
coaster

2889.93 --> 2893.6189999999997
[Music]

2891.46 --> 2896.559
cave theme well yeah you could have a

2893.619 --> 2899.579
cave part why not and you can do

2896.559 --> 2899.579
anything with that right

2901.48 --> 2906.339
but inside of an outside dude you could

2904.059 --> 2908.7000000000003
make it into like an entire adventure

2906.339 --> 2908.7
thing

2908.98 --> 2914.38
that's the funny thing about theme parks

2911.079 --> 2916.119
it's not that tough but yeah

2914.38 --> 2918.339
my main

2916.119 --> 2920.859
feature that I was thinking about that

2918.339 --> 2922.359
you by the way suggested at first and I

2920.859 --> 2924.64
don't know what the neck breaking was

2922.359 --> 2927.7599999999998
all about

2924.64 --> 2929.2
is a horizontal roller coaster that

2927.76 --> 2931.48
tightens up

2929.2 --> 2933.46
and then goes down

2931.48 --> 2936.339
in a straight drop

2933.46 --> 2939.579
and while doing that shape being

2936.339 --> 2941.14
surrounded by a funnel

2939.579 --> 2945.099
round

2941.14 --> 2948.04
that has water basically squirting

2945.099 --> 2950.8
with pipes so that it is going yeah

2948.04 --> 2954.22
around the the

2950.8 --> 2956.38
funnel like circular like it's going

2954.22 --> 2959.14
down the drain so you would be seeing

2956.38 --> 2962.7400000000002
water like in a waterfall going down the

2959.14 --> 2966.5989999999997
drain underneath you as you go in a

2962.74 --> 2966.5989999999997
spiral past it on the roller coaster

2971.92 --> 2976.02
magic school bus ride

2976.42 --> 2981.04
okay

2977.97 --> 2981.04
[Music]

3002.46 --> 3009.98
biggest toilet dude

3006.26 --> 3009.98
that's hilarious

3017.94 --> 3023.819
well yeah technically you could do that

3021.119 --> 3026.46
although it's probably a lot less

3023.819 --> 3028.74
appealing to go on the ride than when

3026.46 --> 3030.54
you realize you're literally going in a

3028.74 --> 3032.7599999999998
toilet bowl

3030.54 --> 3036.68
it's like it's just gigantic toilet seat

3032.76 --> 3039.6600000000003
sitting up there as you go

3036.68 --> 3042.859
into the sewers

3039.66 --> 3042.859
to find Hillary

3057.9 --> 3064.5
no but really what it's

3060.9 --> 3066.359
washing hair like a a scene in one of

3064.5 --> 3068.76
the Pirates of the Caribbean or

3066.359 --> 3071.5789999999997
something like that

3068.76 --> 3074.6400000000003
this is that idea that there's like this

3071.579 --> 3077.099
pluck in the ocean being unplugged and

3074.64 --> 3078.9
suddenly there's ah there's a

3077.099 --> 3081.48
like

3078.9 --> 3083.099
funnel that's going down the drain and

3081.48 --> 3086.46
then the ship is caught up and that's

3083.099 --> 3089.4
like really epic and exciting and scary

3086.46 --> 3090.9
that scene ever yeah from some Moon one

3089.4 --> 3092.76
of I think a Pirate of the Caribbean

3090.9 --> 3095.1600000000003
movie that's really what the idea is

3092.76 --> 3097.7400000000002
based on if you can literally make that

3095.16 --> 3101.359
experience in a roller coaster

3097.74 --> 3101.359
that would be [ __ ] Epic

3107.7 --> 3113.9399999999996
and yeah well considering where I even

3111.0 --> 3116.7
got the idea beginner Pirates of the

3113.94 --> 3118.079
Caribbean ride or the second or third I

3116.7 --> 3119.04
don't even know there probably is

3118.079 --> 3121.2000000000003
already

3119.04 --> 3124.02
Pirates of the Caribbean right just do

3121.2 --> 3126.2
it in a new version or something I don't

3124.02 --> 3126.2
know

3127.26 --> 3132.48
maybe it already exists I I don't know I

3130.5 --> 3136.88
haven't gone to

3132.48 --> 3136.88
roller coaster rides in a long time

3136.98 --> 3139.64
like

3139.859 --> 3144.66
over a decade

3142.5 --> 3147.319
and never even outside of the

3144.66 --> 3147.319
Netherlands so

3154.94 --> 3160.7000000000003

oh [ __ ] yeah you're right

3165.18 --> 3169.98
that's right I almost forgot Pirates of

3167.099 --> 3172.7400000000002
the Caribbean is actually a movie based

3169.98 --> 3174.48
on a ride I almost forgot that that's

3177.42 --> 3180.599

3179.579 --> 3183.7400000000002
just

3180.599 --> 3183.7400000000002

3223.74 --> 3227.54
a very ill thought off idea

3228.78 --> 3232.6400000000003

3378.42 --> 3384.2400000000002
hidden word horizontal spiraling above

water above a water funnel

3384.24 --> 3389.0989999999997
dropping through it there's an idea for

3386.579 --> 3391.38
a roller coaster setup now

3389.099 --> 3395.839
or at least part of it

3391.38 --> 3395.839

always just capture them send them out

form of fly is okay I'll just capture

4336.26 --> 4340.900000000001
kind of

4337.699 --> 4340.9
really in here

4369.62 --> 4373.599999999999
not much colder outside

4375.95 --> 4379.1089999999995
[Music]

4394.78 --> 4399.5599999999995
supplies well I think it's just

4397.06 --> 4403.280000000001
electromagnetic sensitivity

4399.56 --> 4405.080000000001
right the energy of the body we I think

4403.28 --> 4406.5199999999995
they have a sense for that so they can

4405.08 --> 4408.0199999999995
literally see if somebody's getting

4406.52 --> 4410.96
really pissed off

4408.02 --> 4413.42
and then they respond accordingly they

4410.96 --> 4415.64
have like a response to

4413.42 --> 4418.4
you getting angry or you getting really

4415.64 --> 4420.1990000000005
still getting ready to strike

4418.4 --> 4423.5
all these

4420.199 --> 4426.62
actions that you take bring with them a

4423.5 --> 4428.84
certain type of output energy output

4426.62 --> 4431.0599999999995
like the way you compose yourself the

4428.84 --> 4433.159000000001
way you hold yourself that's like all

4431.06 --> 4436.34
energy that's radiating off you in a

4433.159 --> 4437.12
very specific way people can pick that

4436.34 --> 4439.46
up

4437.12 --> 4441.64
but I bet that flies can pick that up

4439.46 --> 4441.64
too

4444.56 --> 4449.719
just like for example mosquitoes have

4447.38 --> 4452.78
probably have a heat vision because

4449.719 --> 4454.04
that's the way they can find where the

4452.78 --> 4456.199
blood is

4454.04 --> 4457.699
like closer to the surface that they're

4456.199 --> 4460.239
not just gonna bite in the middle of a

4457.699 --> 4460.239
piece of bone

4466.4 --> 4471.139999999999
rats are geniuses

4468.44 --> 4473.259999999999
they can be if they're not all poisoned

4471.14 --> 4473.26
up

4517.1 --> 4522.56
yeah that's weird pjc net

4520.34 --> 4525.08
really they don't live longer than three

4522.56 --> 4527.320000000001
years they they really never longer than

4525.08 --> 4527.32
that

4531.26 --> 4537.5
but that is fascinating though

4534.08 --> 4538.699
because then the intelligence is like a

4537.5 --> 4542.06
necessity

4538.699 --> 4543.98
were it to even survive if it only lives

4542.06 --> 4546.14
that long

4543.98 --> 4551.259999999999
right it would have to figure out things

4546.14 --> 4551.26
really quickly or it's not gonna survive

4551.84 --> 4554.02
foreign

4564.64 --> 4568.96
what's up with these sock accounts

4598.3 --> 4604.219
that's hilarious Jared Sanford

4601.46 --> 4606.76
let's prove humans are smart and can

4604.219 --> 4606.76
train them

4655.4 --> 4660.739
well George effort look they just

4658.46 --> 4662.9
they're quick to learn and they have a

4660.739 --> 4666.0199999999995
lot of spatial memory they would have to

4662.9 --> 4668.599999999999
to always find their way through complex

4666.02 --> 4670.52
holes and all that orientation is

4668.6 --> 4672.4400000000005
everything that's Survival

4670.52 --> 4674.6
but yeah

4672.44 --> 4677.599999999999
when you take those kinds of like sort

4674.6 --> 4680.659000000001
of miraculous abilities into account

4677.6 --> 4684.14
well there's freaking insects

4680.659 --> 4686.96
that have that too and that's like they

4684.14 --> 4691.1
don't even have a brain

4686.96 --> 4693.14
yet they have memories of vast territory

4691.1 --> 4695.2390000000005
like what

4693.14 --> 4697.280000000001
that they can find their hole in the

4695.239 --> 4699.759999999999
middle of a desert their nest that's

4697.28 --> 4699.759999999999
insane

4699.92 --> 4705.92
right and

4701.54 --> 4707.7699999999995
yeah and that's not even a mammal

4705.92 --> 4710.179
that's just an insect

4707.77 --> 4712.52
[Music]

4710.179 --> 4715.28
I don't understand how insects can have

4712.52 --> 4717.46
such memory

4715.28 --> 4717.46
foreign

4729.26 --> 4732.679
I guess it's just all about imprinting

4731.78 --> 4735.44
though

4732.679 --> 4738.1990000000005
but that's still just

4735.44 --> 4741.44
like to me that would almost imply that

4738.199 --> 4744.5599999999995
it does have some form of consciousness

4741.44 --> 4746.299999999999
this is yeah it's just really mysterious

4744.56 --> 4749.3
to me

4746.3 --> 4749.3
insects

4772.52 --> 4777.92
now but near the grass that's not rats

4775.52 --> 4781.2390000000005
though that was Mouse Topia it was with

4777.92 --> 4781.2390000000005
mice not rats

4815.06 --> 4822.580000000001
yeah but Matthew yeah I remember that I

4818.0 --> 4822.58
saw that like in 2006 really interesting

4823.82 --> 4828.62
but yeah

4826.4 --> 4831.98
when you basically cram them together

4828.62 --> 4834.739
you give them infinite food and drink

4831.98 --> 4837.138999999999
then eventually they stop procreating

4834.739 --> 4839.98
become gay

4837.139 --> 4839.9800000000005
weird

4840.86 --> 4844.42
like aberrant Behavior

4845.659 --> 4849.92
and then they all die

4847.82 --> 4852.5199999999995
they go insane and they just lose the

4849.92 --> 4852.52
will to live

4866.659 --> 4870.28
hey gauge inspector

4876.44 --> 4881.48
this is

4878.78 --> 4883.34
right yeah I got an I got an email from

4881.48 --> 4886.58
somebody about that Gadget inspector

4883.34 --> 4888.860000000001
land Tides expect questions about that I

4886.58 --> 4890.6
think it was from Rob H by the way Rob H

4888.86 --> 4892.219
thank you for the super chat or the

4890.6 --> 4893.659000000001
PayPal donation

4892.219 --> 4897.02
the other day

4893.659 --> 4900.199
but uh yeah that's absolutely ridiculous

4897.02 --> 4903.580000000001
I mean if it literally would go 30

4900.199 --> 4906.86
centimeters closer to the Earth

4903.58 --> 4908.48
every month

4906.86 --> 4911.719
uh

4908.48 --> 4915.138999999999
that's extremely noticeable

4911.719 --> 4917.3
like measurable angular size change and

4915.139 --> 4919.88
I mean like

4917.3 --> 4922.219
you can literally calculate based on the

4919.88 --> 4923.78
presupposition of the distance of the

4922.219 --> 4926.32
Moon to Earth

4923.78 --> 4929.5
like that's not gonna last very long

4926.32 --> 4929.5
I mean

4930.08 --> 4936.0199999999995
how long do we got like 50 years now

4933.739 --> 4938.54
like a thousand years and then it would

4936.02 --> 4941.2390000000005
crash or something

4938.54 --> 4943.219
but yeah considering like how long the

4941.239 --> 4946.759999999999
Earth's already supposed to have existed

4943.219 --> 4949.52
then it makes no sense

4946.76 --> 4951.9400000000005
makes it nothing about it makes any

4949.52 --> 4951.9400000000005
sense

4955.699 --> 4960.5
band for no I'm Banning you because

4957.739 --> 4962.78
you're a sock account you don't actually

4960.5 --> 4964.04
have a normal account like a normal

4962.78 --> 4966.86
person

4964.04 --> 4969.8
and you constantly insist on creating

4966.86 --> 4971.719
sock accounts to speak up

4969.8 --> 4973.04
I don't want to deal with people like

4971.719 --> 4976.1
that

4973.04 --> 4980.42
why don't you just be a person

4976.1 --> 4983.719
and behave like a normal human being

4980.42 --> 4985.6990000000005
so we can get to know you as a

4983.719 --> 4988.28
consistent human being not as some

4985.699 --> 4991.58
shapeshifter that's constantly

4988.28 --> 4994.34
hiding behind easily create internet

4991.58 --> 4996.32

5019.9 --> 5024.659
it's [ __ ] Steven traveler it's just

5022.179 --> 5024.659
not true

Yahoo news oh yes

5052.9 --> 5056.879999999999
that's the ultimate source

5081.219 --> 5089.199
yeah whatever this is a giant mock trial

5085.36 --> 5091.78
anyway like it's [ __ ] oh oh yeah AP

5089.199 --> 5094.239
news oh yes yes it's everywhere of

5091.78 --> 5097.48
course Timmy Trevor it's everywhere

5094.239 --> 5099.5199999999995
like the biggest most ridiculous mock

5097.48 --> 5102.339999999999
trial I've ever seen and I actually did

5099.52 --> 5104.8
watch it a big chunk of it

5102.34 --> 5106.06
grew left DeVille actually live streamed

5104.8 --> 5110.320000000001
it

5106.06 --> 5114.52
it was complete an utter horseshit

5110.32 --> 5117.82
I mean I've seen like rushed

5114.52 --> 5120.76
criminal Nazi trials in in Hollywood

5117.82 --> 5124.78
movies that seemed more logically

5120.76 --> 5127.719
Justified those complete mockery not it

5124.78 --> 5130.54
wasn't even a trial so oh yeah according

5127.719 --> 5132.94
to that oh yes shoes and now damages and

5130.54 --> 5136.8
then he has to file bankruptcy

5132.94 --> 5136.799999999999
it's all horseshit

5141.219 --> 5146.88
I mean I don't even think that they can

5143.679 --> 5146.88
follow through on that

5146.92 --> 5153.9
I mean he Alex Jones didn't get a trial

5150.1 --> 5153.900000000001
that wasn't a trial

5154.48 --> 5160.48
it was super unconstitutional and it was

5157.42 --> 5163.32
just a mockery of Justice unlike I've

5160.48 --> 5166.419999999999
ever seen before and that includes

5163.32 --> 5169.48
[ __ ] third world countries with

5166.42 --> 5173.56
dictators that kill people because

5169.48 --> 5176.879999999999
whatever okay this is ridiculous

5173.56 --> 5176.88
was ridiculous

[Music]

5203.159 --> 5206.46

5234.27 --> 5238.689
[Music]

5238.96 --> 5245.5
okay well okay if that can happen if it

5242.86 --> 5248.92
can just happen well then you're all

5245.5 --> 5250.719
[ __ ] America can burn it is going to

5248.92 --> 5253.4800000000005
burn if this is actually going to happen

5250.719 --> 5257.92
and that trial is just gonna

5253.48 --> 5261.218999999999
be officially rectified

5257.92 --> 5263.9800000000005
and affirmed by everything then you can

5261.219 --> 5266.38
all burn and I mean it like

5263.98 --> 5268.659
you [ __ ] you America you're gonna let

5266.38 --> 5271.6
that just happen

5268.659 --> 5274.78
like you've come to the point where that

5271.6 --> 5276.52
can happen you are so beyond [ __ ] you

5274.78 --> 5278.8
should all just [ __ ] kill yourselves

5276.52 --> 5281.860000000001
and get on with it because you're not

5278.8 --> 5284.139
gonna survive this you will not survive

5281.86 --> 5286.239
this no matter how much you grow no

5284.139 --> 5288.82
matter how much you isolate no matter

5286.239 --> 5292.599999999999
how much you're self-sufficient you let

5288.82 --> 5295.719
this [ __ ] happen you're all going to die

5292.6 --> 5297.52
this is ridiculous it's ridiculous that

5295.719 --> 5299.86
it wasn't stopped even on the inside

5297.52 --> 5301.360000000001
that nobody just stepped in it just like

5299.86 --> 5303.099999999999

5301.36 --> 5307.08
stop it

5303.1 --> 5307.08
this is ridiculous

5310.6 --> 5316.4800000000005

5313.84 --> 5317.92
like I don't understand why he's cocking

5316.48 --> 5319.9
like this

5317.92 --> 5322.84
like it's cocking to even give

5319.9 --> 5325.599999999999
recognition to any of it

5322.84 --> 5328.06
why would he file bankruptcy I would

5325.6 --> 5330.6990000000005
simply ignore it like this is all

5328.06 --> 5333.46
[ __ ] lies I can every time somebody

5330.699 --> 5334.48
would appeal to whatever fine it's like

5333.46 --> 5337.54
no

5334.48 --> 5339.339999999999
I didn't have a trial this is a piece of

paper that says something because a

5339.34 --> 5345.639
bunch of retards stay in it's [ __ ]

5342.639 --> 5348.6990000000005
it wasn't according to procedure this is

5345.639 --> 5352.08
all provably false and a mockery of

5348.699 --> 5354.58

5352.08 --> 5358.139
recognizing that he had this supposed

5354.58 --> 5363.0599999999995
fine it's ridiculous

5358.139 --> 5363.06
ridiculous I think it's embarrassing

5363.48 --> 5370.299999999999
embarrassing to give recognition to that

5366.4 --> 5373.54
it's even a thing happening by him by

5370.3 --> 5376.54
Alex Alex should simply say hey go [ __ ]

5691.42 --> 5697.719
this crazy stupid ass situation with the

Sandy Hook I think Alex Jones is in on

5697.719 --> 5702.28
it I think he's conspiring with these

5700.54 --> 5705.34
[ __ ] satanists

5702.28 --> 5707.38
I mean the guys practically [ __ ]

5705.34 --> 5711.219
when it comes to guns he's afraid of

5707.38 --> 5714.1
them he's Alex Jones is afraid of guns I

5711.219 --> 5717.52
think he's actually anti-gun

5714.1 --> 5718.96
this is Satanist and he's pretending to

5717.52 --> 5721.540000000001
be pro-gun

5718.96 --> 5724.119
but he's actually scared shitless off it

5721.54 --> 5726.28
he's scared shitless of guns and he

5724.119 --> 5728.619
actually wants everybody to not have

5726.28 --> 5730.96
guns so he could just [ __ ] do

5728.619 --> 5733.44
whatever his monstrous instincts tell

him to do

5759.219 --> 5765.159

6334.26 --> 6338.6
It All Happened very suddenly like last

6336.3 --> 6338.6

6412.159 --> 6416.36
at least the show is interesting

6419.159 --> 6424.679
and now you know my opinion right even

6421.739 --> 6426.959999999999
if the the episode gets taken down

6424.679 --> 6430.34
I don't think it is because it's

6426.96 --> 6430.34
absolutely harsh [ __ ]

6431.46 --> 6437.82
like it's not in title

6434.34 --> 6440.6990000000005
like who the hell would even come here

6437.82 --> 6443.219
in order to be offended by that

6440.699 --> 6446.759999999999
I mean if you're not offended by the

6443.219 --> 6448.199
title of my show the standard everyday

6446.76 --> 6449.6990000000005
title

6448.199 --> 6453.44
then you're probably not gonna be

6449.699 --> 6453.44
offended by what I just talked about

6457.679 --> 6464.159
right so unless you're a hostile cyber

6461.4 --> 6466.619
stalker that just wants to destroy

6505.08 --> 6507.0599999999995
show

6505.92 --> 6509.9
yeah

6507.06 --> 6509.900000000001

6513.179 --> 6516.4400000000005
thank you Omega Genesis

6518.09 --> 6521.319
[Music]

6530.159 --> 6537.9
yeah now while everybody

6534.06 --> 6540.4800000000005
from the start I was like Irwin why are

6537.9 --> 6542.94
you having Flat Earth in your title that

6540.48 --> 6545.94
way you get caught off and you won't get

6542.94 --> 6548.759999999999
promoted you won't get a bigger audience

6545.94 --> 6550.86
oh you make less money oh come on like I

6548.76 --> 6552.780000000001
had a whole years and years where

6550.86 --> 6555.36
anti-flat earthers were literally trying

6552.78 --> 6558.42
to seduce me into taking Flat Earth out

6555.36 --> 6559.92
of my title I'm not even joking that

6558.42 --> 6563.219
really happened

6559.92 --> 6566.28
yeah they didn't understand

6563.219 --> 6569.04
it's a safety net

6566.28 --> 6571.139
I call it flat Earth

6569.04 --> 6574.32
in the title

6571.139 --> 6577.7390000000005
because that way the terrible terrible

6574.32 --> 6580.199
delusional squirt boys and girls that

6577.739 --> 6583.08
are fully dependent

6580.199 --> 6585.96
um the Beast system and its lies about

6583.08 --> 6588.36
reality yeah those are the people that

6585.96 --> 6590.699
ruin other people's lives

6588.36 --> 6593.699
and they would like Sue because of oh

6590.699 --> 6595.919999999999
you hurt my feelings yeah I don't want

6593.699 --> 6598.0199999999995
those people and I don't get those

6595.92 --> 6601.139
people because those people are not

6598.02 --> 6604.139
gonna click on a show that's called Flat

6601.139 --> 6606.599
Earth early bird every freaking day for

6604.139 --> 6609.42
four years yep

6606.599 --> 6613.02
that was a tactical decision it was a

6609.42 --> 6616.5
tactical decision to do that and yeah

6613.02 --> 6620.46
the barring of a growing audience to

6616.5 --> 6624.02
that extent was worth it it was worth it

6620.46 --> 6624.02
it was worth that sacrifice

6624.54 --> 6630.36
because people that click my show they

6627.9 --> 6633.0
know what they could expect it could be

6630.36 --> 6636.86
boring it could be super interesting it

6633.0 --> 6641.58
could be extreme and I mean extreme

6636.86 --> 6644.219
really extreme to unheard of levels

6641.58 --> 6646.26
like people don't normally do that and

6644.219 --> 6649.02
when they do it they mess up and then

6646.26 --> 6651.2390000000005
they just become hysterical I am not

6649.02 --> 6653.159000000001
hysterical I don't do that I am actually

6651.239 --> 6655.5599999999995
structural when I do it and that's quite

6653.159 --> 6657.839999999999
unique right but nobody's going to be

6655.56 --> 6664.159000000001
offended by it

6657.84 --> 6664.159000000001
this is the Flat Earth early bird show

6666.54 --> 6669.32
you see

6669.38 --> 6673.28
long-term reasoning

6675.119 --> 6677.78
foreign

6677.96 --> 6681.149
[Music]

6686.4 --> 6690.54
I mean

6687.719 --> 6692.94
just look at the hashtags

6690.54 --> 6694.86
right

6692.94 --> 6697.879999999999
look at the hashtags

6694.86 --> 6697.88
when I got in there

6702.06 --> 6706.8
let me find here hashtag intolerance

6710.96 --> 6716.2390000000005
#execute Marxist revolutionaries yeah

6717.659 --> 6725.219
Satan hashtag Satan is lies hashtag car

6721.44 --> 6727.86
Christians also yeah yeah oh you're oh

6725.219 --> 6730.38
you don't oh my God how could I have

6727.86 --> 6733.259999999999
been offended by what this guy is

6730.38 --> 6737.159000000001
talking about on his Flat Earth early

6733.26 --> 6740.58
bird show I mean just look at the frick

6737.159 --> 6745.098999999999
hashtag viruses are lies

6740.58 --> 6745.099
look at the hashtag lists

6746.94 --> 6753.36
if you've read that and you should it's

6750.36 --> 6754.32
there every single show if you've read

6753.36 --> 6757.0199999999995
that

6754.32 --> 6760.86
and you weren't offended then how could

6757.02 --> 6763.7390000000005
you become offended by my activities

6760.86 --> 6766.139
on the live stream

6763.739 --> 6769.4
that's ridiculous

6766.139 --> 6769.400000000001
that's ridiculous

6771.54 --> 6777.42
this is not like a kids show

6774.96 --> 6779.88
that's meant for a wider audience it's

6777.42 --> 6783.659
all smoothing out and safe so nobody

6779.88 --> 6786.54
could be hurt no no this is the Flat

6783.659 --> 6790.799999999999
Earth early bird show

6786.54 --> 6790.8
with hashtag intolerance

6791.639 --> 6795.96
I mean

6792.96 --> 6795.96
ridiculous

6799.5 --> 6804.0
and technically right like to even have

6802.739 --> 6806.638999999999
that hashtag

6804.0 --> 6809.4
I don't even think that I am intolerant

6806.639 --> 6812.88
enough if I was truly like purely

6809.4 --> 6814.5599999999995
intolerant I would be be offensive a

6812.88 --> 6816.4800000000005
whole lot more but then probably YouTube

6814.56 --> 6819.4800000000005
would kick me off

6816.48 --> 6822.178999999999
I go after very specific groups

6819.48 --> 6824.759999999999
like that

6822.179 --> 6826.619
you try to hint

6824.76 --> 6829.280000000001
talk around

6826.619 --> 6829.28
you know

6830.88 --> 6837.38
but yeah I can have my opinions about

6834.0 --> 6837.38
events and what happened

6839.88 --> 6845.88
and if I suspect there's really evil

6842.58 --> 6849.96
play at work then I will describe that I

6845.88 --> 6849.96
will describe my suspicions

6851.699 --> 6858.419999999999
yeah also there is footage out of offset

6856.08 --> 6862.26
event that I mentioned before that this

6858.42 --> 6864.78
squirt boy got all reported over

6862.26 --> 6867.96
there's footage that just shows that

6864.78 --> 6870.84
those people are not

6867.96 --> 6873.96
not grieving victims at all like not

6870.84 --> 6876.659000000001
even close not even close

6873.96 --> 6878.42
I can read people I'm an empath I can

6876.659 --> 6881.82
read that off them and I'm not alone

6878.42 --> 6885.119
everybody saw that everybody knows like

6881.82 --> 6888.299999999999
this is just not what it is

6885.119 --> 6890.78
whatever allegedly happened right that's

6888.3 --> 6894.119000000001
why for example I'm never going to say

6890.78 --> 6895.259999999999
nobody died at

6894.119 --> 6898.619
um

6895.26 --> 6899.76
no I'm gonna say no nobody died in that

6898.619 --> 6901.139
place

6899.76 --> 6903.179
huh

6901.139 --> 6906.36
that's what I said I didn't say nobody

6903.179 --> 6909.9
oh yeah I believe kids died oh yeah yeah

6906.36 --> 6914.48
just not not there and not like that

6909.9 --> 6914.48
yeah yeah that's right

6915.36 --> 6918.98

7021.44 --> 7024.678999999999
don't understand why you said such a

7023.119 --> 7027.5
thing that's a real gamma move there

7024.679 --> 7029.86
Gadget inspector that's a gamma move

7027.5 --> 7029.86
there

7038.48 --> 7043.82
yeah but Sean Hawkins is an anti-flat

7085.94 --> 7090.5599999999995
I mean leave that to your teenage

7087.739 --> 7093.259999999999

7090.56 --> 7095.56
to be messed with like that I really

7093.26 --> 7095.56
don't

7097.639 --> 7102.52
yeah I don't like to be lied to as a

7151.76 --> 7153.76
no

7161.0 --> 7166.58
I'm sure I like a joke don't don't make

7163.82 --> 7168.619
a joke by lying to me

7166.58 --> 7172.5199999999995
I don't think that's funny especially

7168.619 --> 7175.098999999999
after there's just been a conflict okay

7172.52 --> 7178.84
it's not funny that's terrible that's

7175.099 --> 7178.84
what stupid teenagers do

7180.54 --> 7183.7789999999995
[Music]

7206.92 --> 7210.9800000000005
don't talk to me like that

7209.54 --> 7213.82
dark

7210.98 --> 7213.82
hello

7216.08 --> 7222.92
hey don't tell me how to deal with the

7219.38 --> 7226.34
people in my chat that I've known for

7222.92 --> 7227.4800000000005
well at least a year on a daily basis

7226.34 --> 7229.9400000000005
yeah

7227.48 --> 7233.119
you don't need to tell me

7229.94 --> 7235.879999999999
how to deal with my chat okay Dart yeah

7233.119 --> 7239.5
I manage this show I deal with the

7235.88 --> 7239.5
people the way I see fit

7241.04 --> 7247.54
and now you're getting a timeout

7243.38 --> 7247.54
talk to me like that again in your band

7247.58 --> 7252.639
this is not a joke show yeah

7268.4 --> 7273.138999999999
that's a great show

7271.159 --> 7276.04
I thought my roller coaster idea is

7273.139 --> 7276.04
really interesting

7276.139 --> 7281.659000000001
I mean at least it would be emulatable

7279.44 --> 7283.098999999999
right if you have like a roller coaster

7281.659 --> 7286.159
design

7283.099 --> 7289.4800000000005
program you could at least try to make

7286.159 --> 7289.48
it and see what that's like

7292.699 --> 7299.678999999999
it would be kind of a pity

7295.639 --> 7299.679
if nobody got to pick up on it

7299.719 --> 7303.92
then again the idea is probably just

7302.119 --> 7307.299999999999
gonna sit in my mind

7303.92 --> 7307.3
for a pretty long period

7307.82 --> 7310.0
foreign

7318.82 --> 7322.0599999999995
I don't know

7326.9 --> 7332.659
somebody who likes to hang around flat

7329.119 --> 7335.0
Earth's chats life Jets

7332.659 --> 7337.098999999999
I mean I thought it was kind of a troll

7335.0 --> 7339.679
but he has been kind of talking

7337.099 --> 7343.6990000000005
relatively

7339.679 --> 7347.02
okay in the last few days but now he had

7343.699 --> 7347.0199999999995
to be a dick again so

7347.96 --> 7351.86
yeah no

7349.52 --> 7355.76
if somebody makes a stupid joke and it

7351.86 --> 7359.0599999999995
pisses me off and then ruins the mood no

7355.76 --> 7362.360000000001
no it's not that mood you see

7359.06 --> 7364.46
I don't want that jokey mood oh you have

7362.36 --> 7367.219
a consensus that you would rather be

7364.46 --> 7370.159
like hahaha Let's make stupid jokes like

7367.219 --> 7371.78
teenagers yeah let's not do that yeah

7370.159 --> 7373.46
let's not

7371.78 --> 7376.36
if you want to make a joke make an

7373.46 --> 7376.36
actual funny joke

7376.639 --> 7382.84
now don't [ __ ] around with somebody when

7379.58 --> 7382.84
something shitty just happened

7386.42 --> 7392.4800000000005
make it on right now but that's you

7388.52 --> 7395.84
can't do that it doesn't work on games

7392.48 --> 7398.119
I mean you could get something sort of

7395.84 --> 7399.26
like it but not with the very specific

7398.119 --> 7401.96
setup

7399.26 --> 7404.179
you're gonna have to really use like a a

7401.96 --> 7407.9
real designer or at least a designer

7404.179 --> 7410.179
emulator for that and dude there's like

7407.9 --> 7412.879999999999
television programs on this coffee

7410.179 --> 7415.46
Channel um like people that make those

7412.88 --> 7417.8
things and how you design that and how

7415.46 --> 7420.5
you test it so I mean there is just

7417.8 --> 7422.719
programs like that

7420.5 --> 7425.36
so I'm kind of like hoping somebody's

7422.719 --> 7428.06
gonna pick up one and be like huh yeah

7425.36 --> 7431.839999999999
why not they could probably like pull

7428.06 --> 7433.88
that together in like an hour tops

7431.84 --> 7435.8
shouldn't be that difficult to build it

7433.88 --> 7439.719
in the simulation

7435.8 --> 7439.719
to people that do that professionally

7441.98 --> 7448.0599999999995
okay Roller Coaster Tycoon three

7445.28 --> 7448.0599999999995
a classic

7448.34 --> 7452.4400000000005
that's some fun with those types of

7450.26 --> 7452.4400000000005
games

7454.099 --> 7461.179
had the most fun with the really old one

7458.179 --> 7463.159
yeah Roller Coaster Tycoon one on the

7461.179 --> 7467.619
Amiga 1200 that's right I actually

7463.159 --> 7467.619
played that game on Miami at 1200.

7467.98 --> 7472.5199999999995
it was great

7471.09 --> 7475.159000000001
[Music]

7472.52 --> 7478.400000000001
and it worked really well

7475.159 --> 7482.739
and no no errors and [ __ ]

7478.4 --> 7482.739
no crashing it worked great

7488.54 --> 7492.5
the afterlink yeah no the eftling is

7491.48 --> 7494.54
pretty cool

7492.5 --> 7497.78
but it's not really a roller coaster

7494.54 --> 7498.98
park it's more it has some roller

7497.78 --> 7503.8
coasters

7498.98 --> 7503.799999999999
like two or something that's it

7505.46 --> 7510.8
but if you want a roller coaster park

7507.38 --> 7513.1990000000005
I'd I'd go to Six Flags that's like pure

7510.8 --> 7515.5
roller coaster with a couple of other

7513.199 --> 7515.5
things

7516.34 --> 7520.659000000001
I love that place it's great

7522.32 --> 7525.739
they have a few new ones oh I didn't

7523.94 --> 7528.04
even know that I haven't been there in a

7525.739 --> 7528.04
long time

7538.88 --> 7544.6990000000005
Valley B oh well

7541.52 --> 7546.92
it it was used to call rally be

7544.699 --> 7550.04
and then it turned into Six Flags and I

7546.92 --> 7552.26
guess it turned back into wallaby

7550.04 --> 7555.159
it's always changing names

7552.26 --> 7555.159000000001
I don't know why

7561.92 --> 7564.579
dude

7568.06 --> 7573.079000000001
your the French have been rubbing off

7570.92 --> 7574.639
their humor until you Gadget inspector

7573.079 --> 7576.86
this is just terrible

7574.639 --> 7578.84
I mean this is like

7576.86 --> 7580.4
what Owen Benjamin would call like

7578.84 --> 7582.5
Coddington level

7580.4 --> 7585.219
puns and humor

7582.5 --> 7585.219
terrible

7587.84 --> 7590.56
uh

7618.139 --> 7622.599
ah okay hello Emma Peel

7622.699 --> 7629.839999999999
yeah you are a little bit late the show

7626.48 --> 7633.0199999999995
has been going on for over two hours wow

7629.84 --> 7634.46
yeah it's been all over the place you

7633.02 --> 7636.5
will certainly missed something I

7634.46 --> 7638.96
definitely watch it back

7636.5 --> 7640.4
you might want to hurry up

7638.96 --> 7642.7390000000005
because

7640.4 --> 7645.199
I got a little pissed off earlier and

7642.739 --> 7646.638999999999
then somebody decided to go squirt over

7645.199 --> 7650.98
my chat

7646.639 --> 7650.9800000000005
with threats of reporting me

7651.98 --> 7656.199
so yeah who knows

7659.42 --> 7665.02
this is ridiculous though I mean it's

7661.699 --> 7665.0199999999995
not in the title it's

7665.42 --> 7671.119
I I personally didn't even bring it up

7668.719 --> 7674.92
like I wouldn't even want to bring that

7671.119 --> 7674.92
subject up I think it's annoying

7688.04 --> 7694.579
yeah let me do a hobo code report me for

7691.699 --> 7699.159
the Captain Hook event

7694.579 --> 7699.159
just gonna do that and say it like that

7701.3 --> 7706.659000000001
right just like Alex Jones

7721.28 --> 7727.28
I actually like that Captain Hook event

7723.92 --> 7730.76
that's a great way to say it

7727.28 --> 7733.639
because hey guess what Captain Hook

7730.76 --> 7735.1990000000005
Never Never Land yeah that's fantasy

7733.639 --> 7738.56
[ __ ] too

7735.199 --> 7740.299999999999
and it's kind of creepy so yeah that's a

7738.56 --> 7743.0
good way to say it it's the Captain Hook

7740.3 --> 7745.76
event I mean

7743.0 --> 7748.54
that's the perfect way to actually

7745.76 --> 7748.54
bypass

7749.179 --> 7752.1990000000005
the whole [ __ ]

7753.32 --> 7758.619
you have do you don't understand oh my

7755.36 --> 7758.619
God Emma Peel

7760.82 --> 7768.28
remember there's a there was a school

7764.96 --> 7770.179
something happened

7768.28 --> 7773.599
allegedly

7770.179 --> 7777.8
and now Alex Jones is in the courts

7773.599 --> 7781.9400000000005
because of that [ __ ]

7777.8 --> 7784.04
it's cool with the name hook remember so

7781.94 --> 7786.86
I'm gonna call it the Captain Hook event

7784.04 --> 7789.04
I think that's a pretty good way to put

7786.86 --> 7789.04
it

7794.48 --> 7799.638999999999
yes Captain Hook on a Sandy Beach that's

7798.26 --> 7802.599
right

7799.639 --> 7802.599
you get it

7805.28 --> 7809.5
it's the Captain Hook Beach event

7828.46 --> 7836.06
Gadget inspector you are like really

7831.8 --> 7838.29
oozing French terrible humor today

7836.06 --> 7841.39
uh

7838.29 --> 7841.39
[Music]

7842.48 --> 7846.199
and she didn't know he wasn't okay

7845.06 --> 7849.34
fine

7846.199 --> 7849.339999999999
I don't blame you

7896.48 --> 7899.78
yeah

7897.98 --> 7902.718999999999
that's right that's why I don't really

7899.78 --> 7904.28
make any claims I just have an opinion

7902.719 --> 7907.4
about what I think really happened

7904.28 --> 7909.679
that's all not a claim I'm not involved

7907.4 --> 7911.659
I don't give a [ __ ]

7909.679 --> 7914.96
I didn't understand why everybody's

7911.659 --> 7919.0
acting like this in relation to that

7914.96 --> 7919.0
alleged event in the first place

7933.98 --> 7939.699
yeah it's race it's [ __ ] though no

7936.98 --> 7939.699
it isn't

7940.699 --> 7947.079
yeah it's not that simple it really

7944.239 --> 7947.079
isn't that simple

7947.48 --> 7952.339999999999
that person is not a heavily traumatized

7951.079 --> 7955.579
person

7952.34 --> 7957.8
it's that simple yeah it's not about how

7955.579 --> 7960.98
he suddenly was laughing and then

7957.8 --> 7962.84
changed his mood no it's about he

7960.98 --> 7964.579
doesn't look like a traumatized person

7962.84 --> 7968.119000000001
like that at all he doesn't look like

7964.579 --> 7970.4
somebody who feels like God just took

7968.119 --> 7973.339999999999
half their life away or something he

7970.4 --> 7975.98
does not look and feel like that at all

7973.34 --> 7978.56
has nothing with is laughing or anything

7975.98 --> 7980.659
it's the whole thing is just it's not

7978.56 --> 7982.76
real

7980.659 --> 7987.098999999999
what they were trying to

7982.76 --> 7987.099
display is fake

8015.579 --> 8023.139
yeah I can ass face I can

8020.079 --> 8025.179
I can actually do that it's I don't need

8023.139 --> 8027.219
to read a mind though I can read

8025.179 --> 8030.36
somebody's feelings

8027.219 --> 8030.36
I can read

8030.46 --> 8034.06
a lot

8031.78 --> 8038.38
and you can sense what their state is

8034.06 --> 8041.619000000001
and how deep that goes I can I can sense

8038.38 --> 8042.9400000000005
that at phrase I'm the [ __ ] Oracle I

8041.619 --> 8045.699
can sense that

8042.94 --> 8048.098999999999
you want to test me on that

8045.699 --> 8051.339999999999
face to face or something because if

8048.099 --> 8053.26
you're going to actively hide it

8051.34 --> 8055.179
yeah then I'm not gonna sense your

8053.26 --> 8056.7390000000005
natural senses because you're actively

8055.179 --> 8058.9
trying to hide it but I can definitely

8056.739 --> 8061.718999999999
pick up that you would be trying to hide

8058.9 --> 8063.759999999999
it when you do so if you just want to

8061.719 --> 8065.86
trick me yeah you could probably trick

8063.76 --> 8067.780000000001
me but I'll know you'll trick me

8065.86 --> 8070.598999999999
yeah as

8067.78 --> 8075.219
to somebody a third party that's not

8070.599 --> 8077.619000000001
aware of me looking and what I can see

8075.219 --> 8080.139
I can simply pick up what's going on

8077.619 --> 8082.48
inside them I can

8080.139 --> 8086.02
I'm the Oracle I can do that I'm an

8082.48 --> 8088.619
empath I've trained skill to do that

8086.02 --> 8088.619000000001
foreign

8103.619 --> 8109.9
would I go about that it's very simple

8106.54 --> 8112.42
an event happens I read

8109.9 --> 8113.679
their body language

8112.42 --> 8116.86
then

8113.679 --> 8119.86
I see what else happens and what the

8116.86 --> 8121.96
event turned out to be really after

8119.86 --> 8124.239
other people investigate and more

8121.96 --> 8125.86
information comes out and the situation

8124.239 --> 8127.0599999999995
is presented

8125.86 --> 8130.42
right

8127.06 --> 8133.780000000001
that's how I would go about that

8130.42 --> 8136.78
sense it then I check was it true

8133.78 --> 8139.0599999999995
and then I get it yes or no

8136.78 --> 8142.239
that's how I know

8139.06 --> 8145.780000000001
yeah that's why I usually don't know the

8142.239 --> 8148.419999999999
second it happens I can have suspicions

8145.78 --> 8150.219
immediately the second it happens like

8148.42 --> 8155.4400000000005
when it's the first time ever being seen

8150.219 --> 8158.44
yeah this event is quite some time ago

8155.44 --> 8161.379999999999
a lot of things have rolled out since

8158.44 --> 8164.079
then that it can intricately tie in to

8161.38 --> 8167.88
the exact frequency as he was carrying

8164.079 --> 8170.92
inside of him when it happened yeah

8167.88 --> 8175.92
time will tell

8170.92 --> 8175.92
it does and I know how it does

8181.0 --> 8185.5
all right see you later Gadget inspector

8183.159 --> 8187.42
take it easy take it easy on the silly

8185.5 --> 8189.82
puns too I mean some people might get

8187.42 --> 8192.48
really annoyed by that

8189.82 --> 8192.48
uh

8195.04 --> 8200.559000000001
you said you can read minds too no it's

8198.219 --> 8204.178999999998
not literally the thinking I can't read

8200.559 --> 8208.358999999999
cognition I can't predict cognitive

8204.179 --> 8209.559
events and I can read feelings and very

8208.359 --> 8211.599
detailed

8209.559 --> 8214.719
that's what I read I don't literally

8211.599 --> 8217.899
read thoughts I read feelings and I

8214.719 --> 8219.518999999998
predict thoughts that's what I do

8217.899 --> 8221.679
and I can use that same thought

8219.519 --> 8224.58
prediction process

8221.679 --> 8227.26
which is based on reverse engineering

8224.58 --> 8229.84
intellect in general like how people

8227.26 --> 8232.359
think and how certain types tend to

8229.84 --> 8235.54
think and how feelings guide thinking

8232.359 --> 8237.519
all of that combined free knowledge and

8235.54 --> 8239.380000000001
then I can when I figure somebody out

8237.519 --> 8241.12
through their frequencies and then have

8239.38 --> 8243.96
that cross-reference to their behavior

8241.12 --> 8247.359
and then I can a lot of the times

8243.96 --> 8250.598999999998
especially if they're not very sharp and

8247.359 --> 8251.800000000001
focused predict what they're gonna be

8250.599 --> 8254.2
thinking

8251.8 --> 8256.42
and that's how I predict thinking it's

8254.2 --> 8259.179
not literally telepathy but it is

8256.42 --> 8262.019
effectively telepathy through oversight

8259.179 --> 8262.019
and understanding

8271.12 --> 8276.519
yeah that's not gonna work at place

8274.54 --> 8279.34
it doesn't work like that I just

8276.519 --> 8282.719000000001
explained it to you I don't literally

8279.34 --> 8282.719000000001
read thoughts

8283.77 --> 8292.79
[Music]

8302.5 --> 8307.84
yeah no let's round out the show

8305.859 --> 8310.24
yeah I'm not gonna hang around for

8307.84 --> 8312.099
another hour because now you're feeling

8310.24 --> 8316.92
like doing something

8312.099 --> 8316.92
here hey Jim West let's see you

8317.26 --> 8322.0
extremely late

8319.899 --> 8326.279999999999
I mean the show should have already been

8322.0 --> 8326.28
over like 20 minutes ago so

8334.12 --> 8339.28
I don't mean right fine you go and make

8337.179 --> 8342.3
your little testing program

8339.28 --> 8342.300000000001
go ahead

8343.899 --> 8350.019
but yeah just so you know even though

8347.439 --> 8353.139000000001
you might according to your processes

8350.019 --> 8356.139000000001
and procedures conclude that it's not

8353.139 --> 8359.619999999999
true I'm still going to absolutely

8356.139 --> 8362.139
assume it is true because I use it I

8359.62 --> 8364.54
literally use it all the time even

8362.139 --> 8367.059
though it might not be provable for any

8364.54 --> 8369.76
tests that you devise I don't really

8367.059 --> 8373.42
care because I don't have a need to

8369.76 --> 8375.7
prove my abilities to Skeptics okay I

8373.42 --> 8378.399
don't have the need to do that you

8375.7 --> 8381.519
either figure it out or you don't I know

8378.399 --> 8386.639
what I can do and I don't have a need to

8381.519 --> 8386.639000000001
prove it to anybody I just use it

8395.439 --> 8401.26
yeah I'm poisoning the well no I'm just

8398.68 --> 8403.479000000001
literally I'm doing it right now yeah

8401.26 --> 8406.42
it's not poisoning the well I know I

8403.479 --> 8408.699999999999
know who you are at face I know who you

8406.42 --> 8411.58
are you think I don't remember

8408.7 --> 8413.859
like two years of having verbal

8411.58 --> 8415.78
interaction with you on a flatter debate

8413.859 --> 8418.84
or not you think I don't remember who

8415.78 --> 8420.76
you are I know who how you work I know

8418.84 --> 8423.52
what you're here to do

8420.76 --> 8426.04
and yes you might suggest that first

8423.52 --> 8428.399000000001
that is just an open oh I'm just

8426.04 --> 8432.1
interested but I know you're actually

8428.399 --> 8434.26
secretly wanting to get some bounty to

8432.1 --> 8436.6
get me discredited about some statement

8434.26 --> 8439.66
that I've made especially if it involves

8436.6 --> 8441.460000000001
my own sense of self-worth I know that's

8439.66 --> 8444.34
what you do at phrase

8441.46 --> 8447.759999999998
yeah I'm right on the money with this

8444.34 --> 8450.64
you know why because of my effective

8447.76 --> 8453.960000000001
telepathy that's not literally reading

8450.64 --> 8456.279999999999
your mind but through understanding and

8453.96 --> 8460.899
cross-referencing experiences with you

8456.28 --> 8462.1
I'm able to reconstruct how you think on

8460.899 --> 8465.22
the long run

8462.1 --> 8467.2
how you work what you will do and I just

8465.22 --> 8469.479
laid it down

8467.2 --> 8472.6
because that is what you're gonna do and

8469.479 --> 8474.519999999999
I don't mind I'm okay with that just

8472.6 --> 8476.56
don't get in your head like you could

8474.52 --> 8478.18
ruin anything for me

8476.56 --> 8479.92
that's not poisoning the well it's

8478.18 --> 8484.0
called precaution

8479.92 --> 8486.6
and revealing that you can't you can't

8484.0 --> 8486.6
trick me

8487.5 --> 8490.629
[Music]

8491.14 --> 8495.939
no I'm not wrong and you're lying which

8494.2 --> 8498.76
is something you've been caught doing

8495.939 --> 8500.380000000001
quite a few times so if that is your

8498.76 --> 8503.2
exit strategy you're gonna flip it

8500.38 --> 8505.599999999999
around get over first world no you're

8503.2 --> 8508.240000000002
wrong yeah then you're already doing it

8505.6 --> 8510.76
even before you actually divide an

8508.24 --> 8514.119999999999
actual test you're just here to lie

8510.76 --> 8517.0
because it's very easy to disclaim

8514.12 --> 8518.800000000001
somebody being able to read you if you

8517.0 --> 8522.7
just lie about it

8518.8 --> 8524.92
I know it's very easy isn't it at face I

8522.7 --> 8527.2
know it's very easy for you to do that

8524.92 --> 8528.939
you've been caught doing that a lot of

8527.2 --> 8532.6
the times and gaslighting everybody

8528.939 --> 8535.720000000001
about it yeah because I know who you are

8532.6 --> 8538.300000000001
and how you work

8535.72 --> 8541.42
you can't Gaslight me about that [ __ ]

8538.3 --> 8546.119999999999
you hear me I know I'm right you can say

8541.42 --> 8546.12
no all you like I know what you do

8549.06 --> 8552.72
thank you

8561.399 --> 8567.279999999999
yeah but it isn't mind reading I already

8565.12 --> 8569.439
disclaimed it to you so you're open to

8567.28 --> 8571.84
something that they literally say no

8569.439 --> 8574.18
that's not what I do

8571.84 --> 8578.319
I am not reading mine I am not

8574.18 --> 8581.5
extracting thoughts through my senses

8578.319 --> 8585.0
of somebody's else somebody else's inner

8581.5 --> 8587.979
conversation that's not what I do

8585.0 --> 8590.92
I reconstruct

8587.979 --> 8594.039999999999
your thinking processes

8590.92 --> 8596.26
your entire personality in order to

8594.04 --> 8597.460000000001
start predicting what it is you are

8596.26 --> 8601.18
going to do

8597.46 --> 8603.88
that's what I do it's not mind reading

8601.18 --> 8606.04
don't try to sleep in a straw man

8603.88 --> 8608.38
it's very nice you can be open to

8606.04 --> 8613.060000000001
something that I didn't claim as a

8608.38 --> 8616.42
rebuttal as to how I'm wrong yeah no no

8613.06 --> 8619.14
that's not gonna get through this this

8616.42 --> 8619.14
is not gonna work

8621.819 --> 8627.039999999999
okay you call it mind reading oh fine

8624.819 --> 8630.1
right but I'm not gonna do this right

8627.04 --> 8631.899000000001
now so I am gonna run out the show it's

8630.1 --> 8633.58

8649.18 --> 8653.5
almost there and I really

8651.22 --> 8656.56
flat side's been a very

8653.5 --> 8660.58
creative and

8656.56 --> 8663.64
yeah very creative and videography wise

8660.58 --> 8665.819
capable flat earther and he deserves a

8663.64 --> 8665.819
computer

8666.28 --> 8670.6
and we're almost there it's like 95 more

8668.859 --> 8675.12
Euros I think

8670.6 --> 8675.12
something like that let me check again

8678.16 --> 8682.96
oh

8679.54 --> 8686.080000000002
oh there's yeah uh 85 now

8682.96 --> 8688.96
so almost there

8686.08 --> 8691.72
just just like five pounds or something

8688.96 --> 8694.119999999999
it doesn't have to be much just a little

8691.72 --> 8696.46
if you can miss it I mean if that's

8694.12 --> 8698.380000000001
coming out of your R win fun then

8696.46 --> 8701.8
freaking don't do it

8698.38 --> 8703.3
but if you got something just a little

8701.8 --> 8705.66
that you could put in there that would

8703.3 --> 8705.66
be great

8708.52 --> 8712.479000000001
plus he speaks very well and clearly

8710.26 --> 8714.880000000001
yeah well not without this yeah we're

8712.479 --> 8718.42
not without a new mic setup because this

8714.88 --> 8720.42
sound currently really sucks fiber out

8718.42 --> 8720.42
um

8721.359 --> 8727.140000000001
oh you'll donate that's that's awesome

8723.22 --> 8727.14
fiber roads thank you for that

8728.859 --> 8732.76
right

8729.939 --> 8735.04
so I'm rounding out the show

8732.76 --> 8737.58
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

8735.04 --> 8740.979000000001
like this show if you didn't

8737.58 --> 8743.62
you might have bumped into the wrong

8740.979 --> 8745.24
Saloon and you shouldn't even be here I

8743.62 --> 8747.28
mean it's called The Flat Earth early

8745.24 --> 8749.5
bird show

8747.28 --> 8752.2
what what are you expecting you were

8749.5 --> 8755.08
expecting to not hear something

8752.2 --> 8757.0
controversial that might be hurtful to

8755.08 --> 8759.34
some people that have like these

8757.0 --> 8761.439
fantasies about reality and can't face

8759.34 --> 8763.359
it yeah well it's called The Flat Earth

8761.439 --> 8765.7
early bird show so what the hell were

8763.359 --> 8769.0
you thinking

8765.7 --> 8771.04
yeah people come here because they want

8769.0 --> 8772.24
something out of the standard out of the

8771.04 --> 8773.740000000002
safe space

8772.24 --> 8775.359
because they want something fresh

8773.74 --> 8777.22
something new something extreme

8775.359 --> 8779.380000000001
something real

8777.22 --> 8782.26
or something extremely controversial

8779.38 --> 8784.899
that hey might turn out not to be real

8782.26 --> 8788.439
but at least I was honest about it

8784.899 --> 8791.56
so I don't see why anything I say should

8788.439 --> 8794.2
ever be the cause of me of me having to

8791.56 --> 8796.84
lose my channel because this is about

8794.2 --> 8799.359
free speech and about free

8796.84 --> 8801.7
freedom of expression and about

8799.359 --> 8803.319
discipline

8801.7 --> 8805.359
right

8803.319 --> 8808.14
it's not just the place to blabber on

8805.359 --> 8808.140000000001
incoherently

8808.3 --> 8812.019999999999
