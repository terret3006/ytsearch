good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.42 --> 19.39
early-bird number 54 I'm your host

11.679 --> 26.85
Arwen and yeah it's a nice second of

19.39 --> 28.3
January 2019 yeah trying to take it easy

26.85 --> 33.54
cuz

28.3 --> 37.09
yeah let's has happened I guess just

33.54 --> 41.8
with me personally it's a lot of unrest

37.09 --> 45.03
and talk to my either and yeah you did

41.8 --> 48.43
some good work so really weird

45.03 --> 55.27
circumstances like weird situations new

48.43 --> 57.7
unexpected haven't encountered before so

55.27 --> 59.32
but yeah it's weird details I might

57.7 --> 60.239000000000004
elaborate a little bit more about it

59.32 --> 65.68
later

60.239 --> 69.19
so yeah thank you a Happy New Year

65.68 --> 71.88000000000001
everyone again I keep on saying that on

69.19 --> 71.88
the street as well

72.94 --> 77.78999999999999
and man yeah

78.92 --> 85.36
I had a weird weird night I was

82.58 --> 87.73
completely

85.36 --> 90.55
just drained all of a sudden yesterday

87.73 --> 92.85000000000001
and went to bed extremely early for my

90.55 --> 92.85
doing

93.39 --> 97.549
or clock

95.51 --> 100.759
or in the

97.549 --> 103.93900000000001
in the afternoon really already what got

100.759 --> 107.179
up a bit later and was all drenched in

103.939 --> 110.14899999999999
sweat really annoying so yeah I got up

107.179 --> 111.56
with like what was it 11 o'clock or

110.149 --> 115.909
something

111.56 --> 119.6
I've asked ten in the evening and then

115.909 --> 123.259
yeah just watch Netflix and did some

119.6 --> 125.74
stuff and not a lot and then went back

123.259 --> 125.74
to bed again

128.61 --> 134.31
three and again woke up really early and

131.48 --> 136.34
same thing really annoying and they've

134.31 --> 142.48
just been so Restless all day

136.34 --> 146.31
so yeah did call my heater and

142.48 --> 149.31
a stellar job as usual with some unusual

146.31 --> 149.31
detections

150.89 --> 155.42
and yeah there is some weird stuff going

153.35 --> 158.06
on there

155.42 --> 164.6
concerning my healer as well because in

158.06 --> 168.2
his spiritual cosmology which I can't

164.6 --> 172.13
just ignore it completely but he talks

168.2 --> 175.33999999999997
about other worlds other end aliens

172.13 --> 178.22
basically but yeah this can only be

175.34 --> 180.23
confirmed apparently in a spiritual

178.22 --> 181.73
sense that's how it seems to be working

180.23 --> 184.97
I'm the ninja

181.73 --> 187.07
I couldn't help myself but start asking

184.97 --> 189.83
him cause much any questions but I

187.07 --> 191.989
couldn't help it just no not like a but

189.83 --> 194.57000000000002
flatters no but it was just like yeah

191.989 --> 197.87
but physical worlds out there that's

194.57 --> 203.75
like really tough and how big is this

197.87 --> 206.3
group and was really fascinating that

203.75 --> 208.31
apparently they were interested and here

206.3 --> 210.77
comes the kind of silly part it was

208.31 --> 213.41
because I had drenched myself in

210.77 --> 216.64000000000001
watching Star Trek apparently when I was

213.41 --> 222.07999999999998
in a weakened state which I have been

216.64 --> 225.32
and they apparently were interested in

222.08 --> 226.85000000000002
my response to that serie that I was

225.32 --> 228.68
watching one of my favorite series

226.85 --> 230.15
actually from Star Trek Star Trek

228.68 --> 232.92000000000002
Voyager

230.15 --> 234.98000000000002
has some really annoying elements to it

232.92 --> 241.22
here and there and some fascinating

234.98 --> 241.22
fascinating concepts ah just

243.34 --> 249.34
it's a very rich series in my opinion

246.069 --> 253.42
but yeah apparently getting all drenched

249.34 --> 258.25
in that drew some unusual spirits from

253.42 --> 260.97999999999996
the outer realms towards me so yeah

258.25 --> 265.02
anyway I got rid of all that they've

260.98 --> 265.02000000000004
been sent back to their own planets

266.13 --> 275.88
spiritually that is and yeah I'm pretty

270.16 --> 275.88000000000005
much clean but I am still nervous a lot

277.44 --> 282.78
I don't know I think maybe this is just

279.45 --> 285.45
that the typical is a post December

282.78 --> 288.63
depression thingy the way it manifests

285.45 --> 291.93
with me because I tend to like suddenly

288.63 --> 294.57
wander off into like really sad things

291.93 --> 298.26
and then I have to like wait no don't do

294.57 --> 300.21
that that's stupid and snap myself out

298.26 --> 302.64
of it before like the feeling really

300.21 --> 306.08
starts to take hold that kind of crap so

302.64 --> 311.09
yeah I have to discipline myself a lot

306.08 --> 311.09
but I'll get through this no problem

311.69 --> 318.0
discipline is the solution to everything

314.66 --> 320.97
it's also very fascinating in the Star

318.0 --> 325.07
Trek series how they treat that cultural

320.97 --> 325.07000000000005
discipline the Falcon

325.97 --> 332.66
yeah I just I can't help it I love it I

329.99 --> 335.72
love what they did and I love the

332.66 --> 339.29
cultural study that it rings and yeah

335.72 --> 340.76000000000005
it's just fascinating so anyway yeah

339.29 --> 344.12
I've been watching a lot of Star Trek

340.76 --> 349.84
Voyager now finally into the fourth

344.12 --> 349.84000000000003
season where the hot he enters the scene

350.66 --> 360.77000000000004
and very interesting character by the

353.84 --> 368.53999999999996
well by the way but no angry and will

360.77 --> 370.66999999999996
not I don't know any anyway I'm a

368.54 --> 375.47
sorcerer I do everything from pure

370.67 --> 378.34000000000003
intuition if I'd actually consider doing

375.47 --> 378.34000000000003
something at all

378.83 --> 385.93
anyway that's that's the India talk

383.3 --> 385.93
but

385.999 --> 392.059
yeah thanks Stephen walks let me get

388.669 --> 395.539
into chat so again yeah

392.059 --> 398.329
there was another chat because to open a

395.539 --> 401.329
panel I have to basically create a

398.329 --> 406.819
separate new hangout instead of the

401.329 --> 408.829
steady daily stream thing just to get ya

406.819 --> 410.389
a hangout panel with the option of

408.829 --> 413.809
having a back chat because without it

410.389 --> 416.059
there isn't one and yeah I prefer this

413.809 --> 418.579
format but yeah after I open that up and

416.059 --> 420.22900000000004
I open the panel then I actually have to

418.579 --> 421.699
cut it out for us there's gonna be two

420.229 --> 424.549
streams and it's really annoying

421.699 --> 427.729
it's a divided chat so I threw it out

424.549 --> 429.649
and I see now that the people in the

427.729 --> 432.429
other chat have entered this one as well

429.649 --> 432.429
so that's good

434.889 --> 446.329
so yeah insulted 667 don't threader UK

441.909 --> 451.419
Nick do white brats

446.329 --> 451.419
so faster serious students

451.88 --> 454.88
right

457.0 --> 459.21
by

464.14 --> 470.68
all right let's see Dan Winfield good to

468.22 --> 476.1
see you and the fields and don't worry

470.68 --> 480.27
okay yeah Stephen walks

476.1 --> 480.27000000000004
Adam II can they get to see you

489.36 --> 494.68
what's what answer would you shag it

493.81 --> 498.66
Klingon

494.68 --> 501.87
oh you mean B'Elanna hell yeah

498.66 --> 501.87
she's hot

503.31 --> 508.47
she's probably like the first hot

505.67 --> 510.42
Klingon this kind of funny because she's

508.47 --> 514.32
hot temperate as well but yeah damn well

510.42 --> 517.5
and I don't know I think a lot of the

514.32 --> 520.1400000000001
the crew are very cute like I like the

517.5 --> 522.06
guys as well in their own way not

520.14 --> 524.85
sexually thank you very much

522.06 --> 527.91
but yeah everyone has their own unique

524.85 --> 529.89
charm and annoying things as well and

527.91 --> 533.55
they sometimes overdo it and that is

529.89 --> 537.6899999999999
kind of like they took like a little bit

533.55 --> 539.6099999999999
back then yeah but look it's the 90s

537.69 --> 544.2600000000001
it's a miracle that it was what it was

539.61 --> 548.52
at the time so but I like the characters

544.26 --> 551.54
a lot and they just go in such depth

548.52 --> 551.54
into things

552.27 --> 557.01
they overdo character traits but they

554.43 --> 558.9899999999999
also really get into spiritual depths

557.01 --> 561.84
and religious depth and metaphysical

558.99 --> 563.52
depth and science fiction techno depth

561.84 --> 565.98
and it's very fastening I'm trying to

563.52 --> 567.54
keep track of the different type of

565.98 --> 570.15
things that they do like all these

567.54 --> 572.16
terminologies and in my head I'm almost

570.15 --> 575.22
treating it like the flat earth debates

572.16 --> 577.74
and just seeing if they are consistent

575.22 --> 579.87
with what they're doing because it is

577.74 --> 581.37
well known that in some series it's just

579.87 --> 584.82
completely all over the place very

581.37 --> 586.86
obvious or plot holes but I'm just

584.82 --> 589.11
trying to see if they get the technology

586.86 --> 591.12
narratives sort of correct and when they

589.11 --> 594.1800000000001
like pull something quickly out of the

591.12 --> 597.03
Steve is like wait that's interesting

594.18 --> 598.8599999999999
are they gonna do that again and yeah

597.03 --> 602.31
sometimes they do but there are a couple

598.86 --> 604.23
of gaps here and there that's it's just

602.31 --> 608.91
like they had to they did something in a

604.23 --> 610.65
hurry it was like it too soon but yeah

608.91 --> 613.86
they do have like a technological

610.65 --> 617.9
development during the entire student

613.86 --> 617.9
series and it's very interesting

619.36 --> 627.9590000000001
okay oh yeah at a Meakin Oroville yeah

624.579 --> 631.42
I've watched that first season it's not

627.959 --> 633.6099999999999
it's HBO I think or something else not

631.42 --> 636.61
Netflix so I can't see it there I

633.61 --> 639.1
downloaded some but the other can do

636.61 --> 645.5790000000001
that anymore but what I saw ya was cool

639.1 --> 648.82
it was really liberal but cool still and

645.579 --> 651.31
again overdone character yeah typical I

648.82 --> 654.85
don't know I it was kind of cool it was

651.31 --> 657.459
weird also but yeah I liked it so far

654.85 --> 662.2900000000001
for the first season that I saw almost

657.459 --> 665.76
of it I think but anyway yeah I love I

662.29 --> 665.76
love this kind of series

666.35 --> 675.08
yeah yeah right in another tone I was

671.36 --> 677.66
just watching Martin Lee cos the video I

675.08 --> 680.39
didn't see it live I don't know did he

677.66 --> 682.91
have blood and I think it was life no it

680.39 --> 685.79
was premiered so you uploaded it the

682.91 --> 689.7199999999999
next cataclysmic events and the

685.79 --> 690.68
Declassified mud flood documents it's

689.72 --> 693.89
terrible

690.68 --> 697.04
I mean terrifying but it's also pretty

693.89 --> 705.56
bizarre because it is like on the direct

697.04 --> 710.0899999999999
CIA government library so doesn't really

705.56 --> 713.15
help too much it's like but freaky very

710.09 --> 715.6
freaky and also makes me realize

713.15 --> 715.6
something

720.79 --> 732.5799999999999
there is more going on to the globe and

727.33 --> 737.4100000000001
outer space and the real world

732.58 --> 739.0
then meets the eye because I remember

737.41 --> 741.55
some of the first times when I was

739.0 --> 745.42
confronted with the larger truth and

741.55 --> 749.2299999999999
really got this yeah got portrayed a

745.42 --> 751.5999999999999
picture by very intelligent people that

749.23 --> 752.9200000000001
I wasn't just I wasn't ready to receive

751.6 --> 755.11
this information basically

752.92 --> 757.06
psychologically but I did get to see it

755.11 --> 761.91
and one of the things that I remember

757.06 --> 761.91
from it is that I was terrified

763.46 --> 772.11
first instinct to impression of a cage

766.35 --> 775.32
and the depending on how you interpret

772.11 --> 779.01
the the total physical nature if you

775.32 --> 782.4200000000001
truly knew it would it all recycle would

779.01 --> 786.75
it go on eternal or would it slowly be

782.42 --> 788.37
grinding down there an end to it because

786.75 --> 792.9
it would be climbing down that kind of

788.37 --> 796.89
and yeah that is one of the things that

792.9 --> 799.35
really made me lunch right back into

796.89 --> 804.39
space like seriously because I just

799.35 --> 807.8000000000001
needed the room and this is very serious

804.39 --> 810.84
and I think that a lot of ballers deal

807.8 --> 815.5799999999999
with these sensation also in the

810.84 --> 819.51
background a true fear a very primal

815.58 --> 824.64
fear like an instinct that they don't

819.51 --> 829.8199999999999
want to have real woken and to be fair

824.64 --> 832.43
it is quite punishing

829.82 --> 836.7800000000001
it is punishing to me it was punishing

832.43 --> 839.1999999999999
and I remember the sensations and even

836.78 --> 842.8399999999999
now when I just for example watch

839.2 --> 846.0200000000001
Martinez gives video and read some of

842.84 --> 850.4300000000001
that stuff it just makes me think about

846.02 --> 852.74
that again like that like time would be

850.43 --> 856.5699999999999
running out for the entire existence

852.74 --> 859.05
that kind of thing it just makes me

856.57 --> 861.24
creeped out

859.05 --> 863.37
and I remember everybody telling me

861.24 --> 865.29
whenever I would confront them it just

863.37 --> 870.05
got over it you know what can you do

865.29 --> 873.12
well it's just feeling that feelings is

870.05 --> 876.9
dreaded as long as it is as it is there

873.12 --> 879.23
and will it go away how do you get it to

876.9 --> 879.23
go away

881.99 --> 887.75
but

883.69 --> 891.1990000000001
yeah I will absolutely learn it and

887.75 --> 894.23
and I'm so much stronger I have so much

891.199 --> 897.189
more compact content within me to fall

894.23 --> 901.4300000000001
back on now then I hit all these times

897.189 --> 904.54
like roughly 20 years ago around that

901.43 --> 904.54
period that

905.35 --> 909.07
the weird thing is when you're really

907.39 --> 912.54
young when I was really young I was

909.07 --> 913.75
absolutely terrified of death of

912.54 --> 917.62
mortality

913.75 --> 922.33
it's just weird I don't know why what I

917.62 --> 924.07
was and now that I'm growing a little

922.33 --> 929.49
bit older yeah I still want to live very

924.07 --> 933.6400000000001
long but life also starts to wear on you

929.49 --> 936.46
eventually and my intelligence is

933.64 --> 939.67
telling me like yeah that's not gonna

936.46 --> 942.46
grow less so what is gonna happen

939.67 --> 944.92
eventually and how do you deal with it

942.46 --> 947.73
or where do you draw the lines and can

944.92 --> 951.4
you draw lines and certain things or

947.73 --> 956.35
will my spirits just force me to break

951.4 --> 961.93
myself in some scenario yeah very deep

956.35 --> 967.03
[ __ ] that's what I deal with but I'm

961.93 --> 969.4499999999999
much older and I'm much and now I'm my

967.03 --> 971.91
attitude where it was before like

969.45 --> 972.5400000000001
must do something to stop this it can't

971.91 --> 977.28
be true

972.54 --> 980.88
and they're like yeah I'm still nervous

977.28 --> 986.49
about it don't like it but I'm starting

980.88 --> 991.74
to understand like okay okay maybe it

986.49 --> 995.19
will end up being acceptable not now but

991.74 --> 1000.05
it might end up being so that kind yeah

995.19 --> 1004.07
it's a better approach and it still has

1000.05 --> 1006.3499999999999
to sing that and it's like a big chunk

1004.07 --> 1009.47
it takes its you might take me another

1006.35 --> 1012.2900000000001
decade or maybe two decades before it is

1009.47 --> 1015.95
completely gone because it's such a deep

1012.29 --> 1019.8499999999999
level and just need to work it through

1015.95 --> 1022.6
let it sink in slowly and grow grow as

1019.85 --> 1022.6
much as I can

1022.959 --> 1027.37
and I also feel these impulses a lot

1025.36 --> 1029.6689999999999
like you had am I really doing the right

1027.37 --> 1032.829
thing here not in the sense that

1029.669 --> 1036.3390000000002
speaking out about the truth because

1032.829 --> 1041.529
that is right I think I'm I'm correct

1036.339 --> 1044.6789999999999
and be honest I am being open but is

1041.529 --> 1046.899
that what I'm supposed to be doing and

1044.679 --> 1050.0690000000002
not that I would do the opposite

1046.899 --> 1050.069
necessarily but

1052.86 --> 1060.12
I'm more than just to amuse a couple of

1055.89 --> 1062.3400000000001
people or just like doing interesting

1060.12 --> 1063.899
tricks but with the mind and speaking

1062.34 --> 1065.97
interesting words and that's kind of

1063.899 --> 1069.289
fascinating to look at you know I don't

1065.97 --> 1076.3990000000001
want to just be that I want to really

1069.289 --> 1080.25
connect more and create some real stuff

1076.399 --> 1091.7689999999998
more I need more it's like I made stuff

1080.25 --> 1094.44
okay I made a lot more I made so many

1091.769 --> 1096.69
things but I don't want to make these

1094.44 --> 1099.3890000000001
kind of things anymore necessarily

1096.69 --> 1104.53
nothing like this it's like a separate

1099.389 --> 1107.24
project by itself but you know

1104.53 --> 1110.6
that's my own thing

1107.24 --> 1113.96
and that's that done

1110.6 --> 1116.6899999999998
but there is no other directions of

1113.96 --> 1120.6490000000001
creation are the directions of design

1116.69 --> 1124.519
but I can't but help but still long to

1120.649 --> 1127.9399999999998
apply architecture of design a building

1124.519 --> 1130.509
or maybe like design a church and Wow

1127.94 --> 1135.88
with all the knowledge that I got now

1130.509 --> 1138.74
like try out this harmonics thing like

1135.88 --> 1140.8090000000002
back engineer it and really figure out

1138.74 --> 1142.85
like yeah what can you do with the

1140.809 --> 1146.87
technology and then how would you apply

1142.85 --> 1148.73
it and yeah what's gonna happen bottle

1146.87 --> 1151.549
it out because I think it can be done

1148.73 --> 1155.019
with computer models by now if you just

1151.549 --> 1158.33
know everything that's required and just

1155.019 --> 1161.84
see if I could like build a an

1158.33 --> 1165.4289999999999
old-fashioned high building just yeah I

1161.84 --> 1165.4289999999999
want to build chips

1168.94 --> 1175.72
yeah but I'm not much of an engineer

1172.149 --> 1179.139
enough super patient and just an artist

1175.72 --> 1183.239
basically so it's gonna probably just

1179.139 --> 1183.2389999999998
mostly be concept drawings or whatever

1185.69 --> 1190.51
and then the same time yeah I do kind of

1191.46 --> 1200.3700000000001
I I had like an idea for a long time

1195.66 --> 1203.3300000000002
like yeah I kind of do want like my own

1200.37 --> 1207.27
church in a way it sounds really bizarre

1203.33 --> 1210.51
but just a like a holy place a place

1207.27 --> 1213.56
where you can pray and I guess it's more

1210.51 --> 1217.65
like a temple but yeah it would be

1213.56 --> 1221.31
definitely dedicated to the path of

1217.65 --> 1223.6200000000001
Christ for example of course and I'm

1221.31 --> 1226.74
just I've been pondering on like iam

1223.62 --> 1231.7199999999998
what how would that work

1226.74 --> 1232.77
what would you be dealing with and how

1231.72 --> 1234.9
are things

1232.77 --> 1236.97
yeah how is time gonna be spent there

1234.9 --> 1240.51
what's gonna be happening and I'm not

1236.97 --> 1245.7
very cleared up in this yet but yeah I

1240.51 --> 1251.21
feel that the right religion needs a

1245.7 --> 1254.5800000000002
righteous place to to thrive and to

1251.21 --> 1257.88
develop a place where people can do that

1254.58 --> 1261.71
and not basically be as forced in

1257.88 --> 1265.6100000000001
doctrine as much rather than just study

1261.71 --> 1268.759
study and talk and

1265.61 --> 1270.879
do things more in this direction yeah in

1268.759 --> 1277.46
another format I don't know

1270.879 --> 1279.32
ideas ideas but what if that's ever

1277.46 --> 1284.45
gonna happen it is gonna take decades

1279.32 --> 1287.059
and yeah it's not it would be a pet

1284.45 --> 1288.769
project and not like an investment based

1287.059 --> 1290.69
thing so it's not gonna be one of the

1288.769 --> 1293.989
things that I'd be doing in on first

1290.69 --> 1296.8400000000001
hand because yeah I don't have what's it

1293.989 --> 1299.69
gonna cost million millions I don't have

1296.84 --> 1304.6999999999998
that so ya can't just invest that kind

1299.69 --> 1305.72
of [ __ ] I don't know where it's probably

1304.7 --> 1309.94
never gonna happen

1305.72 --> 1309.94
but I'm not excluding it

1312.95 --> 1317.3600000000001
at this point with what is around with

1315.32 --> 1322.4199999999998
what can be done what is developing what

1317.36 --> 1325.52
might be revealed like the being timid

1322.42 --> 1329.99
it almost feels like a sim it's like

1325.52 --> 1332.51
just not using anything although I

1329.99 --> 1336.35
shouldn't take it that for technically

1332.51 --> 1340.12
it isn't it just you just have to have

1336.35 --> 1340.12
vision and discipline and

1340.98 --> 1348.45
whenever you create something design it

1344.01 --> 1350.85
in a way where things are transformed

1348.45 --> 1353.79
for the better or something a problem is

1350.85 --> 1357.0
helped without creating a new one that

1353.79 --> 1359.55
kind of thinking that kind of approach a

1357.0 --> 1361.74
holistic approach that you will whatever

1359.55 --> 1367.25
you're going to be dealing with to do

1361.74 --> 1367.25
that it's gonna work always

1367.68 --> 1372.5700000000002
unless you're halted in your tracks

1369.96 --> 1374.81
anyway I'm just talking all over the

1372.57 --> 1374.81
place

1382.809 --> 1386.47
I'm gonna have to listen back because I

1384.879 --> 1390.149
can barely remember what I was even

1386.47 --> 1390.1490000000001
talking about just now

1398.0 --> 1402.64
seems that the trolls are busy in chat

1404.17 --> 1412.96
okay apparently there is some neutral

1406.66 --> 1415.5
video I haven't seen it and I'm not

1412.96 --> 1415.5
you very much

1424.53 --> 1430.71
all right heavens Rhett Crowley I know

1427.8 --> 1433.31
he exists I know about him I know more

1430.71 --> 1433.31
than enough

1440.16 --> 1442.7900000000002
so

1447.13 --> 1452.2890000000002
she's where is everyone oh yeah I guess

1449.95 --> 1455.98
nobody's here because the show should

1452.289 --> 1458.47
normally start right now that's probably

1455.98 --> 1461.289
the reason I started really early this

1458.47 --> 1466.65
time yeah I was just amazed you and I

1461.289 --> 1468.97
have been up incredibly long like since

1466.65 --> 1470.8200000000002
seven or eight o'clock or something I'd

1468.97 --> 1475.09
be there terrible

1470.82 --> 1478.62
so it's very late for me and they don't

1475.09 --> 1478.62
want to drag

1478.9 --> 1487.3100000000002
so what

1484.25 --> 1489.5
yeah I want to do stuff

1487.31 --> 1495.21
and I want to find out more about the

1489.5 --> 1499.44
world if I can but

1495.21 --> 1502.38
a certain regard I do see that look I'm

1499.44 --> 1505.289
not gonna push learning about the wider

1502.38 --> 1506.72
world so much that I can't basically fix

1505.289 --> 1511.08
this world anymore

1506.72 --> 1514.22
so I'm not gonna go total fanatical

1511.08 --> 1517.529
hardcore wherever it might end up going

1514.22 --> 1522.51
and I'm gonna do that that's gonna go

1517.529 --> 1525.96
nuts over it I'm just gonna try to

1522.51 --> 1529.529
manage the whole system bad now it

1525.96 --> 1532.3500000000001
doesn't manage it but I would say it's

1529.529 --> 1535.11
just try to create balance try to create

1532.35 --> 1538.7099999999998
the balance between the dual cosmogonic

1535.11 --> 1540.809
approach basically and let help humanity

1538.71 --> 1547.95
work out the psychology of what's going

1540.809 --> 1552.059
on so as to get the the aggressive

1547.95 --> 1555.51
response issues out of the way learn to

1552.059 --> 1559.58
deal with what's going on with the

1555.51 --> 1559.58
psychological effects of all this

1560.52 --> 1565.49
and I hope that by sharing this that

1563.04 --> 1565.49
people

1566.88 --> 1573.24
learn to deal with it

1570.42 --> 1577.44
maybe delve into the Flat Earth just for

1573.24 --> 1579.66
curiosity's sake and pick up an element

1577.44 --> 1582.0900000000001
about it that is really interesting that

1579.66 --> 1585.14
they can use for inspiration or whatever

1582.09 --> 1588.3
you know it's a free world and

1585.14 --> 1592.039
inspiration yeah we all need it we all

1588.3 --> 1594.289
need it a lot and

1592.039 --> 1596.059
the more huh yeah the more we needed

1594.289 --> 1600.649
them were hungry we've become for it and

1596.059 --> 1603.019
the more mass produced stuff we get

1600.649 --> 1605.299
confronted with and that will start to

1603.019 --> 1607.129
drag and become boring and everybody

1605.299 --> 1609.049
gets annoyed and everybody gets

1607.129 --> 1612.289
desperate for something new that kind of

1609.049 --> 1615.759
stuff starts to evolve so yeah flat

1612.289 --> 1619.1
earth it has a lot of potential

1615.759 --> 1622.33
inspiration and creativity elements

1619.1 --> 1625.639
within it and conceptualizing and

1622.33 --> 1629.4189999999999
spiritual elements to it and historical

1625.639 --> 1631.2199999999998
and there's so much about it that even

1629.419 --> 1634.46
if you don't want to directly address

1631.22 --> 1637.009
the subject you can just take several

1634.46 --> 1638.57
aspects of it and then make a story

1637.009 --> 1642.019
surrounding that and it will be

1638.57 --> 1644.389
fascinating and it will be open to

1642.019 --> 1647.479
interpretation open yeah you can make

1644.389 --> 1649.4289999999999
things multiple angle and I've been

1647.479 --> 1652.989
trying to figure out how to do that as

1649.429 --> 1656.5990000000002
well you can make a story where it could

1652.989 --> 1661.25
where it's left open another example of

1656.599 --> 1665.03
this a perfect example would be doomed

1661.25 --> 1667.039
in a way because they sort of day that

1665.03 --> 1668.27
they still showed between the planets

1667.039 --> 1671.6
and everything and they still call it

1668.27 --> 1674.4189999999999
planets of course but it's almost like

1671.6 --> 1678.1399999999999
yeah they don't fly through space they

1674.419 --> 1680.45
jump they warp through instantly and

1678.14 --> 1683.63
face however you want to approach it and

1680.45 --> 1685.789
it is reminds me a lot about yeah that

1683.63 --> 1690.8600000000001
could be in a flat world with multiple

1685.789 --> 1693.3799999999999
realms where these the trade guilds the

1690.86 --> 1695.6589999999999
traveling guild is basically the sea the

1693.38 --> 1698.98
keepers of the secret of what's really

1695.659 --> 1703.4
going on and they have monopolized

1698.98 --> 1707.03
travel and everybody might believe that

1703.4 --> 1708.74
there it's all planets but yeah as far

1707.03 --> 1711.98
as they know they just know their world

1708.74 --> 1715.46
region and they use these spacefaring

1711.98 --> 1716.24
guilds to transport to other regions and

1715.46 --> 1719.9
that's it

1716.24 --> 1721.76
that's as much as we get to learn pretty

1719.9 --> 1724.46
much it's fascinating because that

1721.76 --> 1726.77
leaves open the interpretation and could

1724.46 --> 1729.02
be planets sure why not or it is

1726.77 --> 1734.24
actually a secret going on

1729.02 --> 1737.5
yeah that's awesome isn't it multiple

1734.24 --> 1740.99
options no yeah multi-dimensional

1737.5 --> 1747.41
storytelling nothing is better in my

1740.99 --> 1754.03
opinion it is fascinating so yeah anyway

1747.41 --> 1758.15
a lot of meta talk here feel bit better

1754.03 --> 1763.85
yeah and Nathan Oakley is still alive

1758.15 --> 1768.74
and kicking thank you very much so I

1763.85 --> 1771.23
don't know why it's taking so long for

1768.74 --> 1773.72
him to start up debates again it is kind

1771.23 --> 1777.6200000000001
of disappointing I have seen him around

1773.72 --> 1780.92
in chat and he has uploaded several

1777.62 --> 1782.54
videos so there are still stuff

1780.92 --> 1785.99
happening but yeah the live-streaming

1782.54 --> 1789.77
capacity seems to be completely gone and

1785.99 --> 1793.42
he doesn't know how to recover it on the

1789.77 --> 1793.42
short run unfortunately

1808.63 --> 1821.44
you guys got a link to that crazy new

1811.52 --> 1824.06
video perhaps review it why not you know

1821.44 --> 1827.6000000000001
I'll check it out for us we coffee if

1824.06 --> 1832.6399999999999
it's just too vile I'm just gonna not do

1827.6 --> 1834.56
that it's kind of funny then why not if

1832.64 --> 1836.89
I inspire people to do these crazy

1834.56 --> 1836.8899999999999
things

1859.68 --> 1866.9
anyway

1861.59 --> 1868.76
yeah I am open to some guests prefer to

1866.9 --> 1874.63
have a couple of flat earthers for a

1868.76 --> 1874.6299999999999
change know what they're doing

1875.36 --> 1881.61
I guess most of them have a life

1878.32 --> 1881.61
with family stuff

1899.429 --> 1901.969
okay

1914.53 --> 1920.08
yeah let's just see where all of this

1916.3 --> 1922.8
goes I'm just gonna keep myself in

1920.08 --> 1928.9399999999998
balance and

1922.8 --> 1933.0
get through this yeah this yeah this

1928.94 --> 1937.65
January just just college anyway get

1933.0 --> 1938.85
through this I have for a lot of times

1937.65 --> 1941.6100000000001
of course

1938.85 --> 1944.49
three times to be exact so shouldn't be

1941.61 --> 1946.77
a big problem this time I've been

1944.49 --> 1951.59
through an extremely traumatic events

1946.77 --> 1955.31
anytime recently so yeah I'm doing good

1951.59 --> 1955.31
compared to other years

1957.14 --> 1962.38
I think that this spring is going to be

1958.91 --> 1962.38
amazing I really do

1963.26 --> 1966.97
I am ready to like

1967.1 --> 1971.35
meet some people some more people

1972.52 --> 1977.1399999999999
and that's gonna happen absolutely no

1974.74 --> 1979.48
not so much now because most people just

1977.14 --> 1983.26
stay in door now so you do bump into a

1979.48 --> 1985.78
cup of people and funnily enough people

1983.26 --> 1988.15
I now bump into are very talkative

1985.78 --> 1990.37
so it's kind of amusing but I also

1988.15 --> 1993.22
detect that that is because they are

1990.37 --> 1996.4289999999999
probably kind of lonely they do look

1993.22 --> 1998.6200000000001
like like the types and they're like not

1996.429 --> 2002.5500000000002
with family or anything and that were

1998.62 --> 2004.9199999999998
alone and just needed to talk maybe

2002.55 --> 2006.78
maybe I'm just looking extremely

2004.92 --> 2009.2
appealing to talk to you on the street

2006.78 --> 2009.2
or something

2013.74 --> 2023.21
now sorry yeah the mic issue I know I'll

2019.529 --> 2023.21
try to keep closer to the mic

2028.46 --> 2042.499
yeah Aires 106 I did for a while

2033.999 --> 2045.98
pretty much so my 13 and then things we

2042.499 --> 2048.879
had changed pretty dramatically in that

2045.98 --> 2048.879
sense and I

2049.2 --> 2053.49
well the environment changed and there

2052.049 --> 2059.25
were different people that were a lot

2053.49 --> 2062.9399999999996
more reasonable and ice skates the yadus

2059.25 --> 2066.379
schools were basically everyone was yeah

2062.94 --> 2066.379
treating me like a black sheep

2067.49 --> 2072.8889999999997
because I still don't I'm not a hundred

2070.669 --> 2075.02
percent sure why but it might be because

2072.889 --> 2081.59
I was just too controversial or

2075.02 --> 2085.429
something I don't know yeah now nowadays

2081.59 --> 2086.96
I hope I don't come across as such and

2085.429 --> 2089.48
don't really try to be

2086.96 --> 2092.48
attention-grabbing like oh please I

2089.48 --> 2095.54
gotta be special no I don't feel like

2092.48 --> 2098.81
that okay so I'm I'm literally trying to

2095.54 --> 2100.79
hold back as much as I can because

2098.81 --> 2102.2
there's so much stuff on my mind at

2100.79 --> 2108.05
times and it's just not for the public

2102.2 --> 2110.8399999999997
but back then I was really desperate to

2108.05 --> 2113.3300000000004
get some recognition in that age and I

2110.84 --> 2115.67
got a lot for my parents I was just

2113.33 --> 2118.48
trying to develop myself so much and

2115.67 --> 2120.92
that the people in the school there they

2118.48 --> 2123.83
they were not like that at all there

2120.92 --> 2127.73
were just typical kids and some were

2123.83 --> 2130.2799999999997
really like right-wing Christians also

2127.73 --> 2132.23
and I didn't even know what that was I

2130.28 --> 2135.0800000000004
didn't understand that at all and the

2132.23 --> 2138.619
culture just my family was like really

2135.08 --> 2141.16
liberal goody two-shoes liberal nineties

2138.619 --> 2141.1600000000003
liberal

2141.609 --> 2148.17
I just didn't get any of the

2145.29 --> 2153.5099999999998
their 18th April in that case it was a

2148.17 --> 2155.88
lot younger when but yeah at least yeah

2153.51 --> 2159.36
after that period of the new school they

2155.88 --> 2161.58
really handed me stuff because I was

2159.36 --> 2163.53
always like a tractor oh please and dad

2161.58 --> 2166.35
there were teachers even with higher

2163.53 --> 2168.42
teachers doing higher classes and they

2166.35 --> 2171.39
would just like to see okay I'm just

2168.42 --> 2172.83
gonna hand you this this big pile this

2171.39 --> 2179.58
is what's coming and I was just like

2172.83 --> 2182.58
whoa okay finally something I can use to

2179.58 --> 2186.33
distract me with to actually work on

2182.58 --> 2188.97
instead of acting weird and acting out

2186.33 --> 2194.94
and yeah that was good that school was

2188.97 --> 2196.6499999999996
good it was also creepy cuz yeah stuff

2194.94 --> 2198.0
happened over there in that good school

2196.65 --> 2202.26
that were not so good

2198.0 --> 2204.03
in retrospect so but yeah that's and I

2202.26 --> 2206.7900000000004
don't want to blame the school because

2204.03 --> 2210.2900000000004
the school itself most of the teachers

2206.79 --> 2210.29
were just really good people

2210.51 --> 2217.32
but yeah I did experience some freaky

2214.92 --> 2218.94
[ __ ] over there as well but that's not

2217.32 --> 2223.2200000000003
the school's fault

2218.94 --> 2223.2200000000003
I think but directly anyway

2223.44 --> 2229.26
and what school doesn't weird [ __ ] or

2226.26 --> 2231.0890000000004
illegal [ __ ] go and go on like try to

2229.26 --> 2241.079
find me a middle school where that

2231.089 --> 2247.0099999999998
doesn't matter anywhere so but no after

2241.079 --> 2247.01
that no I started to really get

2249.26 --> 2255.3500000000004
I don't know I changed a lot during my

2252.59 --> 2259.19
earlier teens but chemically and

2255.35 --> 2262.79
personally I got out of the child

2259.19 --> 2265.34
mindset as much as I could but I also

2262.79 --> 2268.07
held on to certain elements a long time

2265.34 --> 2270.44
and I still have some remnants of this

2268.07 --> 2272.06
although it is slowly sinking away and

2270.44 --> 2275.6
getting replaced by something much

2272.06 --> 2277.2799999999997
better that I like much more I'm glad

2275.6 --> 2279.17
that that's happening that that

2277.28 --> 2283.1000000000004
transformation is happening and that I

2279.17 --> 2287.8
not still clinging on to this old ways

2283.1 --> 2291.5899999999997
of being truth but I was back then and

2287.8 --> 2293.8700000000003
yeah that just in combination with the

2291.59 --> 2297.3500000000004
intelligence that annoyed a lot of kids

2293.87 --> 2299.72
and I made me a target but under new

2297.35 --> 2301.8199999999997
school yeah there were a lot of nerds

2299.72 --> 2305.99
over there and really smart people and

2301.82 --> 2307.82
and bullying was like really really

2305.99 --> 2309.9799999999996
looked down upon and punished and taken

2307.82 --> 2312.4100000000003
very seriously that's yeah

2309.98 --> 2315.02
and the other schools no not so much and

2312.41 --> 2315.71
didn't have control over it but it

2315.02 --> 2320.839
worked

2315.71 --> 2324.52
I guess yeah he's a good school it was a

2320.839 --> 2324.52
private school so

2324.74 --> 2335.66
and yeah I didn't get bullied there I I

2333.339 --> 2338.089
got kind of respected oh yeah people

2335.66 --> 2339.74
kind of respected Mayan temple could

2338.089 --> 2342.32
actually start to understand what the

2339.74 --> 2343.5699999999997
hell I was talking about on average now

2342.32 --> 2346.78
that was new

2343.57 --> 2353.51
usually that only only happen at home so

2346.78 --> 2354.8300000000004
my brother but yeah this was the first

2353.51 --> 2357.0200000000004
time that I would want any other

2354.83 --> 2359.2999999999997
intelligent like smarter people and I

2357.02 --> 2361.25
would start to feel like a normal person

2359.3 --> 2363.76
finally instead of like this black sheep

2361.25 --> 2367.49
outside where it's in the wrong place

2363.76 --> 2372.88
like an alien or something and it was

2367.49 --> 2372.8799999999997
good and never really came back and

2373.18 --> 2379.73
although yeah I did get into weird

2377.24 --> 2381.77
situations sometimes that I wasn't

2379.73 --> 2384.95
prepared for like through the gothic

2381.77 --> 2386.75
scene and through streets stuff I was

2384.95 --> 2388.589
hanging around with a lot of people just

2386.75 --> 2392.38
walking around

2388.589 --> 2393.94
everyone and yeah sometimes dark [ __ ]

2392.38 --> 2398.67
happens and I was extremely passive

2393.94 --> 2398.67
overall and just

2398.83 --> 2404.92
and didn't really get involved so much

2402.07 --> 2408.01
just try to stay safe and just look

2404.92 --> 2410.7400000000002
what's going on what what are these what

2408.01 --> 2413.4700000000003
are people doing what's going on in the

2410.74 --> 2419.43
world this is all so crazy [ __ ]

2413.47 --> 2419.43
sometimes creepy people as well

2423.94 --> 2434.7690000000002
but then yeah eventually it's sank in

2427.42 --> 2437.17
pretty much I guess roughly after 10,000

2434.769 --> 2439.3289999999997
yeah when I really got into Alex Alex

2437.17 --> 2442.2690000000002
Jones like really fired up my

2439.329 --> 2444.309
self-defense mechanism as for that time

2442.269 --> 2449.68
I was so liberal so flexible

2444.309 --> 2452.7690000000002
I would be abusable psychologically

2449.68 --> 2460.18
without even actually realizing it's

2452.769 --> 2462.0989999999997
really painful to remember this then

2460.18 --> 2467.98
there was fear involved very much so

2462.099 --> 2470.2000000000003
that's can't compare it to anything how

2467.98 --> 2472.42
it's nothing like that it's much more

2470.2 --> 2475.48
pressuring much more personal and dark

2472.42 --> 2479.2000000000003
and [ __ ] and yeah I really learned now

2475.48 --> 2480.94
like okay just had to heal here is

2479.2 --> 2482.9199999999996
yelling voice a lot in my head and

2480.94 --> 2486.88
that's just like okay what I've been

2482.92 --> 2489.5190000000002
doing is crazy I need to not go near

2486.88 --> 2491.9500000000003
these people and be very aware just of

2489.519 --> 2494.4399999999996
their hours of the specific dark types

2491.95 --> 2495.73
and then because of the exposure I just

2494.44 --> 2497.89
recognize them

2495.73 --> 2500.829
I recognize the way they look them their

2497.89 --> 2503.529
stance their energy it's very very

2500.829 --> 2509.4300000000003
different if they stand out like a sharp

2503.529 --> 2509.43
knife edge in in a within a bunch of

2510.78 --> 2517.4500000000003
within a bunch of mist it just stands

2513.88 --> 2519.82
out to me and I need to be now I need to

2517.45 --> 2523.93
be responsible with this knowledge and

2519.82 --> 2526.09
just make sure that dark [ __ ] doesn't

2523.93 --> 2530.6699999999996
happen so I need to protect others for

2526.09 --> 2533.5
this but don't you even teach them and

2530.67 --> 2534.01
just work my way in the world as it

2533.5 --> 2537.01
really is

2534.01 --> 2542.1600000000003
with the darkness that is also there and

2537.01 --> 2542.1600000000003
just see what can be done

2542.89 --> 2552.39
it can be done to stop it to tame it to

2549.15 --> 2552.39
transform it

2553.829 --> 2560.789
just to bring peace you know and stop

2557.729 --> 2565.68
the suffering that's basically it that's

2560.789 --> 2569.94
it and yeah I got this defense mechanism

2565.68 --> 2573.2
now so yeah you're gonna bully me well

2569.94 --> 2576.7490000000003
if you want to do that then you've got a

2573.2 --> 2578.519
really mean it because if you think

2576.749 --> 2581.3089999999997
you're some kind of smart ass even if

2578.519 --> 2583.6499999999996
you are working out in the gym you've

2581.309 --> 2588.4500000000003
got to be very serious if you think that

2583.65 --> 2591.2690000000002
you can just take me down it's not an

2588.45 --> 2598.0389999999998
open challenge by the way but I am very

2591.269 --> 2598.0389999999998
well alert so selling this before

2598.54 --> 2605.56
look like somebody to [ __ ] around with

2600.49 --> 2608.83
overall so I guess people don't do that

2605.56 --> 2611.44
it's very smart of them because I'm very

2608.83 --> 2615.7
nice overall and gentle and very

2611.44 --> 2620.17
tolerant but yeah if you screw with me

2615.7 --> 2622.75
there is this crazy guy inside that's on

2620.17 --> 2625.21
a very very very very very tight leash

2622.75 --> 2629.35
and there's very specific moments that

2625.21 --> 2632.98
he is allowed and you've seen only just

2629.35 --> 2634.54
a glimpse of that through my verbal

2632.98 --> 2647.41
expressions when I'm pissed off at

2634.54 --> 2653.2799999999997
somebody that's nothing yeah

2647.41 --> 2653.2799999999997
so I did my thing I'm right

2653.97 --> 2657.4399999999996
how's everybody doing

2662.41 --> 2669.18

2683.56 --> 2689.02
is really true that is what I hope to

2686.86 --> 2692.77
accomplish and I hope you're gonna do

2689.02 --> 2694.74
something positive and creative with the

2692.77 --> 2697.27
knowledge as well and that just let it

2694.74 --> 2700.2999999999997
sit there in the back of your mind

2697.27 --> 2703.12
without being applied as it were I hope

2700.3 --> 2705.9100000000003

2703.12 --> 2714.85

2989.46 --> 2995.34
will get back to live stream but for now

2993.18 --> 2998.1
you're gonna have to settle for me and

2995.34 --> 3001.15
his uploaded videos and maybe ya

2998.1 --> 3001.15
premieres of course

3005.77 --> 3011.38
well I even though Escobar asks a silly

3008.26 --> 3013.4100000000003
question or some really general saying

3011.38 --> 3016.48
that he's a baller yeah well because a

3013.41 --> 3018.99
lot of channels are idiots it doesn't

3016.48 --> 3018.9900000000002
make any damn sense

3020.68 --> 3024.81
why would you call Nathan at all

3025.77 --> 3028.8
that's that's called wishful thinking

3028.2 --> 3033.6299999999997
really

3028.8 --> 3036.2000000000003
or just delusional paranoia however you

3033.63 --> 3036.2000000000003
want to see it

3049.859 --> 3057.2
all right yeah Eric Eric should have

3053.789 --> 3057.2000000000003
arrived insuring it right now

3062.4 --> 3066.829
hope to hear from him sometime soon

3078.6 --> 3081.74
that's hilarious was

3083.42 --> 3087.73
but

3085.51 --> 3090.73
now there's that's actually a lie

3087.73 --> 3095.68
because there is a huge amount of money

3090.73 --> 3097.3
in ballers and being a baller if you

3095.68 --> 3100.66
really want to make it into a business

3097.3 --> 3104.98
because what do you think well that [ __ ]

3100.66 --> 3108.43
is SpaceX and all that so corporations

3104.98 --> 3110.38
that are just using that concept big

3108.43 --> 3112.06
time because there is a white interest

3110.38 --> 3116.1400000000003
because it is part of the propaganda

3112.06 --> 3117.7
narrative you can build with that so

3116.14 --> 3119.109
yeah there is a lot of freaking money a

3117.7 --> 3124.96
lot of freaking interest in people

3119.109 --> 3129.2799999999997
talking about space stuff because people

3124.96 --> 3132.52
want their dream material they want

3129.28 --> 3134.7400000000002
their story they want their good nights

3132.52 --> 3138.55
story there of which they can dream and

3134.74 --> 3140.9199999999996
think it's real so yeah there is a lot

3138.55 --> 3143.4100000000003
of freaking money if Nathan was just in

3140.92 --> 3145.27
it only for the money no matter what

3143.41 --> 3149.7
yeah he would not be doing flatter

3145.27 --> 3149.7
it's absolutely preposterous seriously

3165.13 --> 3170.609
a summer house key happy New Year to you

3168.309 --> 3170.6090000000004
ma'am

3173.89 --> 3178.2999999999997
mm-hmm it's a good one it's a good court

3176.44 --> 3181.7400000000002
their rudeness is the weak man's

3178.3 --> 3181.7400000000002
imitation of strength

3181.94 --> 3184.48
yep

3186.57 --> 3191.3900000000003
or you could say barking dogs don't bite

3193.26 --> 3197.1200000000003
it's pretty much the same concept

3201.82 --> 3207.04
mm-hmm yeah you know what I should look

3204.91 --> 3208.54
back the firework video thing I haven't

3207.04 --> 3211.33
even watched it entirely

3208.54 --> 3214.87
I just after that I just put it down and

3211.33 --> 3218.59
just hung around on the roof it's wrong

3214.87 --> 3225.91
stupid firecrackers down and yeah

3218.59 --> 3228.19
smoking and a lot too much weight but I

3225.91 --> 3231.3599999999997
had a lot of fun and I loved it had a

3228.19 --> 3233.82
good time there was a nice video I think

3231.36 --> 3236.44
don't even remember everything I said

3233.82 --> 3238.36
but I'll watch it back I have to watch

3236.44 --> 3240.9700000000003
it that it was pretty damn long I did

3238.36 --> 3243.33
expect it only like 50 minutes it's

3240.97 --> 3243.33
crazy

3243.72 --> 3247.02
45 minutes

3259.13 --> 3265.539
yeah forty forty three point five

3262.4 --> 3265.539
minutes damn

3266.119 --> 3270.579
I got as far as five and a half

3273.4 --> 3281.56
watch that back what I'm glad you guys

3275.95 --> 3284.8599999999997
enjoyed it I enjoyed it myself oh I

3281.56 --> 3287.44
didn't say too crazy things oh yeah I

3284.86 --> 3289.75
did say that it was happy 2012 that the

3287.44 --> 3291.4
digital clock said it was 2002 oh that

3289.75 --> 3292.15
was really funny I don't know where that

3291.4 --> 3299.23
came from

3292.15 --> 3301.4500000000003
really I was a total mind twist cuz I

3299.23 --> 3302.5
didn't I just didn't even notice I

3301.45 --> 3307.27
didn't even register

3302.5 --> 3307.75
I just afterwards was like hmm wait

3307.27 --> 3310.42
really

3307.75 --> 3312.93
did I really say 2012 yeah okay I did

3310.42 --> 3312.9300000000003
that parent

3335.63 --> 3343.88
anyway yeah it's pretty crowded in chat

3338.15 --> 3348.14
I see well 62 watching not bad so yeah

3343.88 --> 3350.8900000000003
if anyone is interested you can get on

3348.14 --> 3350.89
my panel

3354.69 --> 3361.11
so yeah anyone in the flutters a really

3358.29 --> 3363.44
weird chat or to master be chat right

3361.11 --> 3363.44
here

3388.71 --> 3396.299
right

3390.69 --> 3396.299
now be Mars is not visible in chat so

3397.96 --> 3404.43
I already kicked him you're just seeing

3400.54 --> 3404.43
his shadow just ignore it

3427.5 --> 3437.52
yeah Aries 106 looks like a lot of

3432.27 --> 3441.3
typical Nathan trolls are in chat and

3437.52 --> 3445.369
some of my loyal fans as well so really

3441.3 --> 3445.369
appreciate you always being there

3457.27 --> 3460.27
see

3460.92 --> 3466.199
talk about

3463.07 --> 3466.199
[Applause]

3468.66 --> 3471.79
[Applause]

3476.46 --> 3479.39
I don't know

3479.44 --> 3482.28
it's really stupid

3487.97 --> 3491.41
you got some ideas

3492.17 --> 3497.2400000000002
otherwise I guess yeah if I'm not gonna

3495.2 --> 3498.71
figure out what to talk about you know

3497.24 --> 3501.83
I'll just run out to show I've been

3498.71 --> 3507.2200000000003
going over an hour now I think oh now

3501.83 --> 3507.22
wait almost an hour but let's see

3513.999 --> 3516.6589999999997
sorry

3518.39 --> 3522.2
now there's a certain layer of

3520.58 --> 3525.41
information that I would just love to

3522.2 --> 3527.99
share my findings in this and yes it

3525.41 --> 3529.58
does also involve the dark world but I

3527.99 --> 3532.79
just can't do that in public

3529.58 --> 3537.2599999999998
not because it's criminal but because I

3532.79 --> 3541.0099999999998
just want to be in somebody's presence

3537.26 --> 3544.1600000000003
and private to see their response

3541.01 --> 3547.36
basically because it is pretty heavy

3544.16 --> 3547.3599999999997
stuff pretty

3547.77 --> 3553.29
well it's not even it's not evil or

3550.19 --> 3558.93
necessarily not really it has nothing to

3553.29 --> 3563.0099999999998
do that's just technical but the impact

3558.93 --> 3565.08
that it may have also pretty heavy I'm

3563.01 --> 3570.63
not gonna talk about that I'm just gonna

3565.08 --> 3571.41
poke you guys tell you no no gonna talk

3570.63 --> 3574.8900000000003
about this

3571.41 --> 3577.6499999999996
yep that's Arlen talks about so many

3574.89 --> 3583.3399999999997
things never shuts up but some things it

3577.65 --> 3583.34
just doesn't talk about too bad

3586.68 --> 3589.7999999999997
[Applause]

3593.9 --> 3599.2400000000002
by the way I already talked so deep

3597.03 --> 3603.53
anyway today

3599.24 --> 3606.39
I'm not really used to throwing out such

3603.53 --> 3609.5690000000004
personal stuff really in public I guess

3606.39 --> 3613.2599999999998
I can do it because I am safe now I am

3609.569 --> 3615.089
really it is it's not fun or any kind of

3613.26 --> 3617.76
vulnerability anymore so that's why I'm

3615.089 --> 3622.71
doing it but it is still kind of like

3617.76 --> 3626.19
okay [ __ ] it's not my inner secret

3622.71 --> 3628.17
anymore I guess but yeah I don't

3626.19 --> 3631.02
necessarily want to throw everything

3628.17 --> 3634.26
inside me out there though I want to

3631.02 --> 3639.45
share just a lot that I want to share

3634.26 --> 3642.809
what I do sometimes really throw it out

3639.45 --> 3646.43
there but yeah we'll see what happens

3642.809 --> 3646.4300000000003
you know

3648.79 --> 3659.73
maybe it's a test just to see what you

3652.21 --> 3659.73
guys can do to me and what I need to do

3660.03 --> 3669.6400000000003
move on that's it maybe that's it

3665.999 --> 3673.269
maybe I'm just looking for a flat earth

3669.64 --> 3676.269
again because of the trolls because I've

3673.269 --> 3678.459
missed [ __ ] that are constantly

3676.269 --> 3680.5589999999997
making your life miserable for my old

3678.459 --> 3683.229
school days where that was literally

3680.559 --> 3686.44
happening to me almost every day for

3683.229 --> 3688.779
several years so maybe that's why a lot

3686.44 --> 3693.509
flatter so much because I just love all

3688.779 --> 3693.509
the shitty trolls and the insane madman

3693.93 --> 3707.2
hmm unfortunately that is a

3699.059 --> 3709.9590000000003
psychologically sound theory but yeah

3707.2 --> 3712.8999999999996
it's not the only reason I do it I do it

3709.959 --> 3714.999
mostly because I have to and I guess

3712.9 --> 3717.5190000000002
that falls in the same line because I

3714.999 --> 3722.979
did what I did I was myself because I

3717.519 --> 3726.2389999999996
had to because I could not size myself

3722.979 --> 3728.4689999999996
down in some kind of standardized kid

3726.239 --> 3732.7490000000003
because other people couldn't handle

3728.469 --> 3732.7490000000003
what I deal with in my mind nope

3736.47 --> 3742.0099999999998
and yeah that's kind of the same thing

3739.109 --> 3742.0099999999998
happening here isn't it

3748.539 --> 3752.469
I'm pushing you guys I'm pushing the

3750.849 --> 3755.199
Flat Earth doesn't push the ballers I

3752.469 --> 3757.179
push a person on their bad behavior I do

3755.199 --> 3760.2090000000003
it to every freakin one I'm always that

3757.179 --> 3766.089
annoying guy that always has to meddle

3760.209 --> 3768.569
in everyone's business the but the funny

3766.089 --> 3772.779
thing about it the way I do it is not

3768.569 --> 3775.719
like like family typically does it just

3772.779 --> 3778.089
get in the way I actually hand you off

3775.719 --> 3781.359
or the inconvenient truth that you need

3778.089 --> 3785.799
and of course I'm hated for it I expect

3781.359 --> 3788.739
that to happen you know just like a

3785.799 --> 3791.199
parent with him with little kids that

3788.739 --> 3793.089
doesn't want to do something yeah

3791.199 --> 3795.849
they're gonna hate their parents for it

3793.089 --> 3798.219
when they have to do it but yeah

3795.849 --> 3803.0190000000002
eventually that'll be better for it

3798.219 --> 3805.959
and the parent knows this so I guess my

3803.019 --> 3809.799
parental skills kicking in or whatever I

3805.959 --> 3811.0789999999997
don't know maybe I just I'm ready for a

3809.799 --> 3815.4
parent to it myself

3811.079 --> 3815.4
but for that I'd need a

3816.0 --> 3819.0
proper

3819.15 --> 3823.55
female person

3826.23 --> 3834.2400000000002
and that's gonna be

3829.56 --> 3836.52
I don't know either yeah it's gonna be

3834.24 --> 3838.47
smack like that it's either gonna be

3836.52 --> 3839.85
smack in the face there's no getting

3838.47 --> 3841.89
away from it and it's just gonna

3839.85 --> 3845.52
freaking happen oh no matter how much I

3841.89 --> 3847.5299999999997
scream to try to walk away like no I

3845.52 --> 3850.32
have to do that I can't not do it

3847.53 --> 3855.78
or it's gonna be really difficult to

3850.32 --> 3858.3900000000003
find it you never know I don't know with

3855.78 --> 3866.9700000000003
me it tends to be like really smack me

3858.39 --> 3869.94
very very in the face so no no vegan go

3866.97 --> 3876.02
I'm not gonna visit your brothels in

3869.94 --> 3876.02
Nevada thank you very much you

3884.48 --> 3890.04
yeah

3887.01 --> 3893.1600000000003
I have a certain theory about that that

3890.04 --> 3896.0
is not proper material for this show as

3893.16 --> 3896.0
a breakfast show

3902.64 --> 3907.85
anyway

3904.66 --> 3911.06
prostitutes nope let's just say that

3907.85 --> 3913.25
prostitutes are for people that are just

3911.06 --> 3917.24
not sexually skilled enough to pleasure

3913.25 --> 3920.69
themselves that's when you look at it

3917.24 --> 3923.41
like that it doesn't become dirty just

3920.69 --> 3923.41
become sad

3926.2 --> 3933.8199999999997
anyway happy new year everyone hey

3929.75 --> 3933.82
Nicholas to see you

3941.799 --> 3947.009
what

3943.859 --> 3949.17
how could I copy Nathan show I can never

3947.009 --> 3952.14
copy Nathan show I could never learn

3949.17 --> 3954.21
that intro like he does I could never

3952.14 --> 3959.0389999999998
ask the housekeeping questions as

3954.21 --> 3961.2
perfectly as he does it's like no can't

3959.039 --> 3964.349
do it there's only one flat earth

3961.2 --> 3966.6899999999996
debates from Nathan Oakley and I'm I can

3964.349 --> 3969.6600000000003
do what I can do and I'd like to see him

3966.69 --> 3972.509
try and replace that that level of

3969.66 --> 3975.3289999999997
thinking doing that because yeah he

3972.509 --> 3977.22
already pretty much says that he doesn't

3975.329 --> 3980.009
know how to do that that's just

3977.22 --> 3982.769
something that I can do so yeah Nathan

3980.009 --> 3987.38
he's good at what he does and I am

3982.769 --> 3987.3799999999997
hopefully good in what I do

3988.95 --> 3995.1899999999996
oh gods no freakin boy

3992.22 --> 3997.859
your show is not an exact copy of Nathan

3995.19 --> 4000.5190000000002
sure no it's not

3997.859 --> 4000.519
it's not

4013.39 --> 4016.23
thank sauce

4017.1 --> 4023.13
but I don't know if it's much better

4020.12 --> 4027.99
really I think that the fire debates are

4023.13 --> 4030.42
really amusing and I do miss it I like

4027.99 --> 4035.81
the the weirdest creepiest thing I

4030.42 --> 4040.23
almost miss Riley's long-winded

4035.81 --> 4043.77
oversized a slightly superfluous

4040.23 --> 4046.11
explanations only superfluous in a

4043.77 --> 4048.63
certain aspect of it I'm starting to

4046.11 --> 4051.81
miss hearing that because he does that

4048.63 --> 4053.82
so well now no matter how annoying that

4051.81 --> 4055.5299999999997
might be at times he's still very good

4053.82 --> 4058.65
at it

4055.53 --> 4064.6200000000003
yeah it's different not having that

4058.65 --> 4067.56
around it's nice that

4064.62 --> 4070.23
grantee still does come on here every

4067.56 --> 4072.93
now and then and share some of his photo

4070.23 --> 4077.4
work I really appreciated when he does

4072.93 --> 4082.8799999999997
that always cool yeah

4077.4 --> 4086.88
oh that's terribly true yeah L&B yeah

4082.88 --> 4090.78
sort of missing but the rumpus yes oh my

4086.88 --> 4093.09
god I miss that guy so bad but only for

4090.78 --> 4095.1800000000003
a maximum of 10 minutes because after

4093.09 --> 4099.569
that you can [ __ ]

4095.18 --> 4106.5
but yeah it's like the the doses those

4099.569 --> 4109.8
of rumpus he he's really like a

4106.5 --> 4113.28
jack-in-the-box doesn't he it's just

4109.8 --> 4114.66
like can't help it but like yeah I want

4113.28 --> 4117.29
to see it again then but then it's like

4114.66 --> 4117.29
oh yeah okay

4136.06 --> 4144.01
I believe that apparently P Mars is

4140.35 --> 4147.359
trolling my shed like a madman because

4144.01 --> 4149.95
people keep on responding to him I think

4147.359 --> 4151.950000000001
even though I haven't blocked but for

4149.95 --> 4155.3189999999995
some reason other people still see him

4151.95 --> 4159.04
apparently and I don't know how that is

4155.319 --> 4161.71
even possible I don't get it you know if

4159.04 --> 4163.69
you look at the video stream you can

4161.71 --> 4170.92
clearly see in that's in the chat

4163.69 --> 4174.03
sidebar you can clearly see there's no P

4170.92 --> 4174.03
Mars in there so

4184.179 --> 4194.67
no [ __ ]

4187.029 --> 4194.67
Oh damage we can go your rights okay

4197.61 --> 4200.8099999999995
sorry P Mars

4201.42 --> 4206.63
but you're trolling days on my channel

4203.4 --> 4206.629999999999
are gonna be over

4232.059 --> 4237.419
right

4234.669 --> 4237.419
okay

4249.389 --> 4255.869
blocking it's such a weird mechanism you

4252.15 --> 4260.009999999999
hide from channel and you block in the

4255.869 --> 4260.639
back panel it's it's such a mess the

4260.01 --> 4263.9400000000005
system

4260.639 --> 4266.639
I really wish they just make a proper

4263.94 --> 4268.379999999999
new format but they're not they're

4266.639 --> 4270.9890000000005
obviously not they're obviously waiting

4268.38 --> 4274.1
for internet to to manifest so they can

4270.989 --> 4274.099999999999
get the real thing

4290.53 --> 4299.969999999999
okay so by this I must conclude that P

4295.72 --> 4299.97
Mars is the sole source

4303.149 --> 4309.5
of the trolling here

4305.84 --> 4309.5
one of the [ __ ]

4311.07 --> 4319.4
okay I'm gonna immediately block you

4313.83 --> 4319.4
again let's see

4346.3 --> 4354.03

4351.43 --> 4354.030000000001

4530.12 --> 4536.66
have to have him in the freaking panel

4534.59 --> 4539.96
somewhere to be able to block him it is

4536.66 --> 4542.63
the most the dumbest form of moderation
