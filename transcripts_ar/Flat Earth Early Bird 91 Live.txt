3.589 --> 11.04
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

7.41 --> 17.310000000000002
early-bird number 91 I'm your host

11.04 --> 19.259999999999998
Arwen and today is very stormy day not

17.31 --> 21.659999999999997
sunny at all

19.26 --> 25.770000000000003
and Nathan just started a debate out of

21.66 --> 26.96
nowhere so yeah don't know what that's

25.77 --> 29.73
about

26.96 --> 33.69
well I do know it and then watch the

29.73 --> 37.559
intro and he's having a closed debate

33.69 --> 41.629
between two people and doing that I

37.559 --> 41.629
don't know why he's doing that right now

44.15 --> 53.58
but yeah is what it is

47.12 --> 58.559
so are you guys doing Steve chat for a

53.58 --> 60.78
while HM flat ball [ __ ] juice yeah I

58.559 --> 64.489
decided to start a little earlier

60.78 --> 68.63
because it was kind of sick of waiting

64.489 --> 68.63000000000001
and I was up pretty early

75.44 --> 80.72
I do yesterday

89.36 --> 96.7
talking talking

93.38 --> 96.69999999999999
[Music]

104.439 --> 113.38
yeah well what's kind of interesting is

106.45 --> 118.32900000000001
that I had some contact with family that

113.38 --> 128.349
I haven't spoken to in six years and it

118.329 --> 131.59
was kind of good yeah it seems maybe

128.349 --> 134.64999999999998
that after this entire crazy thing that

131.59 --> 137.68
happened to my family all these people

134.65 --> 142.45000000000002
died and then the whole yeah everybody

137.68 --> 144.84900000000002
just thinks we already agreed on the

142.45 --> 147.64
title of it's like the family exploded

144.849 --> 150.959
just too much [ __ ] happened and

147.64 --> 156.95899999999997
everybody just went their own way and

150.959 --> 156.959
almost like going in hiding I did it

157.09 --> 168.06900000000002
brother did it and nephew did it and

162.69 --> 171.42
maybe there's some new feeling now that

168.069 --> 174.81
we can come back together after all this

171.42 --> 174.80999999999997
try again

177.26 --> 185.209
and feels really comforting because I

181.159 --> 188.54
missed like well having a family really

185.209 --> 190.849
you know look I have a dad but that's

188.54 --> 197.64999999999998
like a dad it's not the same thing as a

190.849 --> 201.319
family more like an individual relation

197.65 --> 205.06900000000002
it will be kind of interesting to see

201.319 --> 207.61999999999998
them again and just after everything

205.069 --> 212.659
that's happened and things coming back

207.62 --> 218.03
to me it's a good opportunity to

212.659 --> 219.92
basically refigure out my old family why

218.03 --> 222.76
they are the way they are already know a

219.92 --> 222.76
lot about it and

224.04 --> 231.989
see if I can unravel some of the more

229.079 --> 236.93900000000002
bizarre things that have happened in my

231.989 --> 240.56
youth but anyway I'm kind of excited

236.939 --> 243.09
about that and they said yeah let's

240.56 --> 247.61
let's come together like in spring

243.09 --> 247.61
somewhere and looking forward to that I

250.73 --> 256.26
was funny she was asking I can't what

255.03 --> 258.329
are you doing these days

256.26 --> 261.63
my aunt's because that's the one I

258.329 --> 267.09000000000003
called and I was like yeah a YouTube

261.63 --> 270.75
channel daily show Oh about what about

267.09 --> 271.88
conspiracy theories can you be more

270.75 --> 280.979
specific

271.88 --> 284.27
all of them yeah I wasn't gonna I was

280.979 --> 284.27
gonna drop that on there

284.5 --> 288.73
maybe things have changed though but not

287.14 --> 289.81
yeah I'm not gonna start out with

288.73 --> 294.18
flitter

289.81 --> 298.79
this feels highly unlikely

294.18 --> 299.91
although yeah again my family are all

298.79 --> 304.51000000000005
[Music]

299.91 --> 308.5
pretty alert people so she's bound to

304.51 --> 310.3
have heard of it somehow someway I don't

308.5 --> 319.09
know if she's very opinionated about it

310.3 --> 322.12
but it's family a but

319.09 --> 322.11999999999995
[Music]

324.439 --> 337.139
yeah also I watched a bit of Timmy Timmy

331.229 --> 340.229
Timmy Timmy Dre and that guys having

337.139 --> 344.129
like it felt like that video felt like a

340.229 --> 349.019
total solipsistic implosion meltdown

344.129 --> 351.839
really like it just seemed so sick of it

349.019 --> 355.67900000000003
all everything of the flat earthers

351.839 --> 363.809
although yeah but also the ballers and

355.679 --> 367.229
my god he was like trashing them many of

363.809 --> 370.96900000000005
them and it's so funny because the the

367.229 --> 370.969
way he was trashing them is basically

371.809 --> 378.89000000000004
well for the reasons

375.53 --> 383.71
that aren't very good because he's doing

378.89 --> 383.71
it himself like no one else it's like

385.87 --> 391.88
yeah was some when some people that are

389.12 --> 394.58
like really in denial really close by in

391.88 --> 396.8
denial when they go on rants it's just

394.58 --> 399.26
fascinating to see how they become like

396.8 --> 402.14
a projection mirror and everything they

399.26 --> 408.83
say is so obviously applicable to

402.14 --> 411.62
themselves so obvious that even they're

408.83 --> 415.31
people that kind of support him have to

411.62 --> 419.45
stand back and like I'm not gonna say

415.31 --> 421.79
this cuz they know everyone knows

419.45 --> 424.90999999999997
everyone in the whole damn world knows

421.79 --> 427.63
except him in that moment it's

424.91 --> 427.63000000000005
fascinating

429.86 --> 433.78000000000003
and sad and ironic

441.26 --> 450.28999999999996
but more yeah you know overall you have

446.37 --> 455.7
some pretty interesting analysis that

450.29 --> 457.92
like yeah there's a subject and subject

455.7 --> 463.34999999999997
rings loose a lot of things in people

457.92 --> 466.68
and yeah there's people then I don't

463.35 --> 467.6
know making some kind of business out of

466.68 --> 470.88
it

467.6 --> 472.77000000000004
just working with that talking about it

470.88 --> 477.54
being a little corner in the internet

472.77 --> 486.09
for people to come and just I guess be

477.54 --> 487.62
amused learn to develop reflect and I

486.09 --> 490.01
don't see anything wrong with that and

487.62 --> 492.39
then at the same time there's the other

490.01 --> 498.36
baller channels out there that are

492.39 --> 501.59
obviously noticing all the all the

498.36 --> 505.35
frustrations from the globe believers

501.59 --> 509.15999999999997
that seem desperate in the face of Flat

505.35 --> 512.5500000000001
Earth desperately in denial desperately

509.16 --> 517.95
in need for somebody to tell the right

512.55 --> 521.25
story to reinforce the belief and so

517.95 --> 526.37
they've for obvious financial reasons a

521.25 --> 531.51
big market will do that

526.37 --> 533.82
and yeah very clumsily defend the globe

531.51 --> 536.33
as yeah that's the only way you can do

533.82 --> 545.58
it because it is a mess

536.33 --> 547.589
it's a big big mess so that was that was

545.58 --> 551.97
kind of funny and ironic that Tim was

547.589 --> 555.3000000000001
just right about that but pretty much

551.97 --> 558.08
every accusation he threw out there it's

555.3 --> 564.6899999999999
just a reflection of what he was doing

558.08 --> 568.94
like so telling that he then starts to

564.69 --> 572.1600000000001
see things like oh there's all this

568.94 --> 579.5400000000001
homoerotic thing is going on with these

572.16 --> 583.3389999999999
people like Tim do you even realize that

579.54 --> 586.5889999999999
that's mostly just you seeing that there

583.339 --> 591.0
you know that's a reflection of where

586.589 --> 595.23
your focus is that you know and I think

591.0 --> 597.56
most people know that it's just

595.23 --> 597.5600000000001
hilarious

601.67 --> 611.209
and I wonder I wonder if Tim knows that

607.399 --> 618.769
he is probably a raving homosexual not

611.209 --> 622.3699999999999
that I mind though no but I wonder if he

618.769 --> 627.25
knows or if he's been in denial all all

622.37 --> 627.25
of his life about it it's weird

634.23 --> 642.6
I just know

637.2 --> 644.75
I'm pretty damn sure that I am not trust

642.6 --> 652.47
me

644.75 --> 655.639
it's physically impossible but I don't

652.47 --> 659.3100000000001
see it in everything as well

655.639 --> 661.74
like I know there's a lot of gay people

659.31 --> 663.6899999999999
out there right now or a lot of people

661.74 --> 667.04
that think they're gay or they're acting

663.69 --> 672.0
gay and it is like a worldwide thing

667.04 --> 674.79
amped up as if you do that then you get

672.0 --> 678.18
more attention you get more shuff to the

674.79 --> 684.019
forefront because it is prison popular

678.18 --> 684.019
and everybody gets it now

684.62 --> 691.529
what yeah I try to just keep that out of

688.5 --> 696.86
my out of my feel the conscious because

691.529 --> 696.86
I really like it

718.24 --> 727.749
no I never do milk in my teeth it's

722.949 --> 732.689
green tea anyway but yeah milk you know

727.749 --> 736.3000000000001
the less you use of it the better and I

732.689 --> 738.279
do use milk in my coffee though but I

736.3 --> 741.7489999999999
don't drink a lot of coffee I do drink a

738.279 --> 741.749
lot of tea not a lot of coffee

751.45 --> 758.34
hey Constance stopping traffic at my

782.8 --> 787.9599999999999
Constance your new job you must be very

789.18 --> 802.78
preoccupied with that probably but no

794.26 --> 805.71
problem just do what you need to do I'll

802.78 --> 805.7099999999999
try to do this in

810.85 --> 813.85
see

828.08 --> 836.11
yeah there's so many there's so many

831.95 --> 836.11
heavy subjects out there now

839.52 --> 845.41
it's so weird because I feel like almost

843.04 --> 848.68
like the world's trying to force me to

845.41 --> 852.9399999999999
address them all but yeah I don't want

848.68 --> 859.2399999999999
to go nuts again probably not gonna

852.94 --> 861.86
happen like that but it's like all these

859.24 --> 864.29
heavy crazy

861.86 --> 867.39
[Music]

864.29 --> 869.01
strangling subjects out there man it's

867.39 --> 874.669
just cliff

869.01 --> 874.669
[Music]

876.279 --> 879.279
but

882.1 --> 890.4200000000001
where do I even start it's just that

887.81 --> 896.29
truth is Oh God yeah I'm gonna bring in

890.42 --> 903.7099999999999
a subject just sucks does like abortion

896.29 --> 912.01
this I was always convinced like yeah so

903.71 --> 913.59
right look what is going on like

912.01 --> 916.889
why are these

913.59 --> 916.889
[Music]

917.33 --> 930.3100000000001
weirdo politicians and cultish pushing

920.93 --> 932.89
it into some kind of freaky over-the-top

930.31 --> 936.5
disgusting thing like that the whole

932.89 --> 938.74
post-birth I don't even want to think

936.5 --> 943.28
about it it's so disgusting it's like

938.74 --> 945.2
what is going on why and yeah move from

943.28 --> 947.8399999999999
the other angle oh of course why because

945.2 --> 954.11
it's all one monolithic thing and it's

947.84 --> 960.0500000000001
the only thing and it's like I can't

954.11 --> 962.12
they just keep it in a moderate why does

960.05 --> 967.25
everything have to become so damn

962.12 --> 970.28
overkill why destroy everything why not

967.25 --> 972.17
just keep some kind of sensible balance

970.28 --> 975.47
it just doesn't make any sense to me

972.17 --> 976.53
it's it really does feel like the

975.47 --> 978.36
world's gone mad

976.53 --> 981.86
[Music]

978.36 --> 985.049
some kind of weird self-destruction

981.86 --> 987.809
frenzy the storm it's the storm I talked

985.049 --> 994.98
about yesterday it is a storm storm of

987.809 --> 996.17
madness and counter madness and it makes

994.98 --> 1001.629
no damn sense

996.17 --> 1001.6289999999999
needs a damn sense

1007.66 --> 1013.8199999999999
because yeah what's gonna happen again

1010.7 --> 1017.33
it's the elastic effect if you don't

1013.82 --> 1019.07
keep things sensible she keep on pushing

1017.33 --> 1020.8100000000001
it and pushing it and pushing it to the

1019.07 --> 1024.55
extreme to the intolerable

1020.81 --> 1027.62
yeah the backlash is gonna be so hard

1024.55 --> 1033.29
that it's very likely that that one

1027.62 --> 1038.4699999999998
subtle balanced thing is gonna be taken

1033.29 --> 1042.71
away entirely and brutally harshly

1038.47 --> 1045.74
punished after that whoo brilliant idea

1042.71 --> 1049.58
what a good reason to amp it up out of

1045.74 --> 1058.52
control it's literally just taking it

1049.58 --> 1061.01
away it's taking it away yeah and in the

1058.52 --> 1064.55
face of the total mad darkness yeah

1061.01 --> 1066.89
that's all such a reliever because

1064.55 --> 1069.1699999999998
that's the only part you get to see not

1066.89 --> 1073.5800000000002
the balance only the horrors and that's

1069.17 --> 1078.04
what propels counter response to just

1073.58 --> 1082.96
destroy it all just wipe it all away

1078.04 --> 1082.96
cuz they're after but yeah

1085.44 --> 1089.3600000000001
what's gonna be left after that

1091.92 --> 1099.8200000000002
but yeah I I just have to support this

1097.69 --> 1103.0900000000001
counter movement because this whole post

1099.82 --> 1113.3999999999999
birth abortion is just an abomination it

1103.09 --> 1117.3999999999999
is madness it's no damn sense and it is

1113.4 --> 1126.4
destroying the left it is destroying

1117.4 --> 1130.7800000000002
that entire heritage things tried all

1126.4 --> 1134.97
the efforts that were put into it it's

1130.78 --> 1139.51
just all being destroyed from the inside

1134.97 --> 1142.56
by these freaking maniacs these absolute

1139.51 --> 1147.06
monstrous maniacs that are beyond

1142.56 --> 1147.06
anything subhuman is just

1153.28 --> 1162.32
so yeah what's gonna happen is that just

1158.0 --> 1165.71
gonna we're just gonna yeah yeah

1162.32 --> 1168.74
everything's going and say we're gonna

1165.71 --> 1171.41
drown in it take every piece of insanity

1168.74 --> 1175.97
we can and get ourselves saturated with

1171.41 --> 1183.25
madness or or just ease ourselves away

1175.97 --> 1183.25
in in revolt and pain at the sight of it

1184.72 --> 1196.99
where's the sensibility in any of this

1188.83 --> 1204.98
why are people surrounding these madmen

1196.99 --> 1208.51
letting this happen why what the [ __ ] is

1204.98 --> 1208.51
wrong with you

1208.59 --> 1217.1689999999999
why are you letting these these people

1214.139 --> 1219.87
obviously drowning in madness and

1217.169 --> 1225.539
reversed wealth craziness why are you

1219.87 --> 1228.809
letting them destroy everything because

1225.539 --> 1232.559
it's not the other side that is doing it

1228.809 --> 1235.44
the other side is only responding to the

1232.559 --> 1238.529
freaking madness that you are doing that

1235.44 --> 1242.0900000000001
you are allowing does it make any damn

1238.529 --> 1242.09
sense what you're doing

1251.05 --> 1256.3
so yeah enough about that [ __ ]

1268.169 --> 1273.96
it's the time of unravelling we're just

1271.379 --> 1277.7389999999998
everything everything comes apart until

1273.96 --> 1282.6000000000001
nothing is left everything is just

1277.739 --> 1290.3890000000001
completely dismantled this integrated

1282.6 --> 1299.6689999999999
unraveled so it's all chaos just pure

1290.389 --> 1310.379
unadulterated limitless chaos can't say

1299.669 --> 1313.99
that I like it yeah constant chaos is

1310.379 --> 1318.79
anti equilibrium it yeah

1313.99 --> 1318.79
and what the [ __ ] is the point of this

1321.6 --> 1329.519
[Music]

1334.03 --> 1337.03
please

1342.48 --> 1345.48
yeah

1354.5 --> 1362.87
JJ this move on from the I hate that

1359.45 --> 1365.98
subject please hate it I hate all this

1362.87 --> 1365.9799999999998
dark [ __ ]

1384.28 --> 1390.58
freedom freedom is not freedom without

1388.07 --> 1390.58
balance

1390.76 --> 1400.32
doesn't work can't work there is no

1393.429 --> 1406.799
unlimited freedom does not exist it's

1400.32 --> 1406.799
fantasy and ideal a dream

1409.3 --> 1414.6
a seduction

1415.23 --> 1420.179
balance it is the only way

1433.57 --> 1439.259
right over local certainly seem so

1464.67 --> 1470.73
computing competing nonsense

1480.78 --> 1483.8899999999999
[Music]

1487.97 --> 1491.019
[Music]

1505.659 --> 1515.659
fascinating yep you people sometimes

1513.799 --> 1518.899
really say interesting things

1515.659 --> 1521.8700000000001
oh by the way I've been getting a lot of

1518.899 --> 1525.7689999999998
subscribers recently like yesterday I

1521.87 --> 1531.3799999999999
had thousand sixty seven now thousand

1525.769 --> 1533.919
seventy eight don't know it's not that I

1531.38 --> 1537.0800000000002
really keep track of it anymore but

1533.919 --> 1542.48
sometimes it's just like look again and

1537.08 --> 1546.6999999999998
it's like um okay that drew all of a

1542.48 --> 1546.7
sudden but it's nice I guess

1550.45 --> 1556.0800000000002
so yeah if if anyone wants to get on you

1553.96 --> 1556.08
know

1576.2 --> 1582.02
put the link out in the master beat yet

1578.66 --> 1584.78
and was already early burchett just want

1582.02 --> 1590.6299999999999
to talk or want to reflect or highlight

1584.78 --> 1593.47
something that I inspired with what I

1590.63 --> 1593.47
was just saying

1611.929 --> 1615.47
Andrea browning

1633.96 --> 1638.58
looks fascinating that's another

1636.33 --> 1640.9199999999998
approach aleksander like water says

1638.58 --> 1642.72
there's no way finding balance in the

1640.92 --> 1646.5900000000001
chaotic world without experiencing

1642.72 --> 1649.1100000000001
unbalance yep you can see it and that

1646.59 --> 1651.99
yeah it is kind of like stepping into

1649.11 --> 1655.02
the darkness touching it to really know

1651.99 --> 1660.66
what it is instead of hearing about it

1655.02 --> 1667.29
learning about a distance and yeah chaos

1660.66 --> 1669.39
order its yeah now we're gonna get to

1667.29 --> 1672.87
some D&D stuff okay

1669.39 --> 1676.68
in D&D there is the alignments good and

1672.87 --> 1680.6699999999998
evil and neutral in between and there is

1676.68 --> 1684.9
law and chaos and neutral in between and

1680.67 --> 1686.52
both form the total spectrum of

1684.9 --> 1693.2900000000002
alignments and it's really fascinating

1686.52 --> 1696.29
because law chaos are just different

1693.29 --> 1696.29
approaches

1696.67 --> 1701.53
that's good and evil it's it's almost

1699.61 --> 1705.1
like the same thing but it's not the

1701.53 --> 1707.49
same thing but it's very similar

1705.1 --> 1710.03
[Music]

1707.49 --> 1710.03
and

1710.71 --> 1714.2
[Music]

1716.03 --> 1722.96
it's fascinating like even how it can

1719.03 --> 1727.34
work in D&D how you can set up these

1722.96 --> 1732.41
alignments and that the alignment

1727.34 --> 1734.4499999999998
basically drives the characters what

1732.41 --> 1739.46
they're doing and why and how they see

1734.45 --> 1743.42
things and in the world there's that as

1739.46 --> 1756.49
well except yeah I'm not the game master

1743.42 --> 1756.49
of this world yeah it seems true enough

1758.83 --> 1761.869
[Music]

1763.78 --> 1770.85
it's kind of natural that yeah once you

1767.409 --> 1775.5300000000002
obtain some kind of talent or power that

1770.85 --> 1779.04
you will naturally walk in to stronger

1775.53 --> 1781.62
and stronger until something goes wrong

1779.04 --> 1784.95
basically with it strength becomes too

1781.62 --> 1788.58
much and that is chaos and only after

1784.95 --> 1793.43
that can you realize that there is such

1788.58 --> 1796.1999999999998
a thing as too much and then balance can

1793.43 --> 1800.54
start to manifest because then you know

1796.2 --> 1800.54
so yeah you made a very good point there

1811.15 --> 1819.7
I think everyone experiences this in

1816.17 --> 1819.7
their lifetime during their youth

1821.61 --> 1831.9799999999998
not everybody learns the lesson

1825.0 --> 1831.98
[Music]

1838.23 --> 1844.53
okay I'll take good for the win yeah

1841.6 --> 1848.1299999999999
chaotic good has always been great

1844.53 --> 1848.1299999999999
favorite of mine

1852.69 --> 1863.009
and libertarianism in essence is very

1857.309 --> 1868.08
much Gailey good is an arctic not very

1863.009 --> 1871.849
yeah law people must be the law not some

1868.08 --> 1871.849
order that must be followed

1875.409 --> 1888.6090000000002
yeah be good to yourself and others and

1880.989 --> 1894.499
maintain that balance to Mary yeah Mary

1888.609 --> 1897.9399999999998
cooperation yeah so evil with that well

1894.499 --> 1900.949
then obviously somebody's gonna try to

1897.94 --> 1903.3200000000002
ream Anna fest some kind of Empire Oh

1900.949 --> 1908.8690000000001
everyone again to give up their freedoms

1903.32 --> 1912.879
and then old [ __ ] starts over again so

1908.869 --> 1916.509
yeah okay I'll take good for the win

1912.879 --> 1916.509
it's a tough one

1921.679 --> 1930.98
and I'm also wondering in the past how

1924.809 --> 1930.98
many times did that manifest

1945.24 --> 1960.669
yeah anyway I'm getting getting boring

1949.419 --> 1966.72
here I'm missing the Sun from yesterday

1960.669 --> 1966.72

2023.809 --> 2029.35
try to enlist in space for us I doubt

2026.0 --> 2029.35
anyone missed

2035.91 --> 2045.3490000000002
[Music]

2051.149 --> 2058.29
but now maybe we we have a force of our

2057.49 --> 2063.5099999999998
own

2058.29 --> 2063.5099999999998
maybe it's the spirit force

2069.47 --> 2072.9399999999996
in your space force

2074.12 --> 2077.87
kind of the same thing

2081.24 --> 2092.2389999999996
a lot of space force goes out there to

2088.73 --> 2095.879
the battle into the Imaginationland

2092.239 --> 2095.879
[Music]

2097.22 --> 2116.7599999999998
Constance hello good morning good

2108.9 --> 2118.79
afternoon evening where we go I miss you

2116.76 --> 2118.7900000000004
guys

2119.089 --> 2127.79
yeah yeah you do visit my show pretty

2125.58 --> 2133.56
much every day in chat at least right

2127.79 --> 2135.24
yes I try to catch up if I if I'm not

2133.56 --> 2138.54
able to sleep at night then I have to do

2135.24 --> 2144.4799999999996
it later but I've been trying to you

2138.54 --> 2148.349
know keep up with you and the the talk

2144.48 --> 2153.109
was the daxing and it kept coming up in

2148.349 --> 2159.54
other shows I was catching up with so

2153.109 --> 2162.089
I'm just puzzled at what lengths people

2159.54 --> 2164.339
will go to to make an impression on

2162.089 --> 2169.29
someone else you know making an

2164.339 --> 2171.39
impression on someone else's life so but

2169.29 --> 2174.96
anyway you were talking about Dungeons &

2171.39 --> 2180.0499999999997
Dragons no I'm not really just just as a

2174.96 --> 2182.9700000000003
comparison does people making all these

2180.05 --> 2187.04
philosophical statements that yeah

2182.97 --> 2190.23
they're pretty much right and in a way

2187.04 --> 2192.48
mmm-hmm but yeah well we could talk

2190.23 --> 2196.609
about the whole what's out there all

2192.48 --> 2196.609
these crazy responses from political

2196.97 --> 2202.5
especially now it's like okay that one

2199.71 --> 2207.03
thing happened what what is it now nine

2202.5 --> 2212.18
shows ago so I know right and people are

2207.03 --> 2217.5
still like something and I just like

2212.18 --> 2220.3199999999997
that's like I thought it was pretty

2217.5 --> 2227.55
clear what that really was I literally

2220.32 --> 2234.1400000000003
on my show explain it but just like

2227.55 --> 2237.54
trying to communicate with people with a

2234.14 --> 2239.5989999999997
unaccustom'd way of living or way of

2237.54 --> 2241.619
looking at things that's it's like

2239.599 --> 2246.9900000000002
countercultural to them they don't get

2241.619 --> 2250.109
it it's you know if they don't have

2246.99 --> 2253.97
experience with a different dimension or

2250.109 --> 2256.8489999999997
a different way of living it's just

2253.97 --> 2261.2999999999997
jibber jabber to them they you know

2256.849 --> 2262.92
doesn't mean anything so maybe later in

2261.3 --> 2266.88
their lives they'll catch on and

2262.92 --> 2274.44
remember also that's what Arlen was

2266.88 --> 2281.03
talking but all in all you're okay

2274.44 --> 2290.21
I seem to be doing pretty good mm-hmm

2281.03 --> 2295.28
I don't know it's like being into these

2290.21 --> 2300.4700000000003
shaky parts it's just very different as

2295.28 --> 2303.53
not being there it's when you get there

2300.47 --> 2306.5899999999997
you start to remember all kinds of weird

2303.53 --> 2309.5600000000004
things relating to that state even in

2306.59 --> 2311.6600000000003
the past it all gets connected then when

2309.56 --> 2314.75
it gradually goes away again

2311.66 --> 2317.5099999999998
all those insights all those connections

2314.75 --> 2321.92
also go away and it's a big relief

2317.51 --> 2325.849
that's the weird thing about it so I'm

2321.92 --> 2332.65
not completely out of it in a literal

2325.849 --> 2338.84
sense but yeah I getting these pulses

2332.65 --> 2340.849
these messages from the world my family

2338.84 --> 2343.82
very specific in this case that are just

2340.849 --> 2346.1800000000003
like yeah there's something good coming

2343.82 --> 2346.1800000000003
and

2346.98 --> 2356.319
it seems to be restoring me or getting

2351.91 --> 2361.95
me ready to be normal again and it's

2356.319 --> 2366.19
just okay now I'm back to doing that and

2361.95 --> 2368.98
also with the realization yeah it's not

2366.19 --> 2372.609
over yet I'm probably gonna be ending up

2368.98 --> 2378.2400000000002
at the same have the position at some

2372.609 --> 2382.859
point again well it's cyclical yeah

2378.24 --> 2382.859
whether we like it or not this is life

2383.369 --> 2389.8900000000003
but you get better at it and you get

2386.349 --> 2394.96
more familiar with it and it seems to

2389.89 --> 2399.22
broaden with each pass so yeah it's like

2394.96 --> 2403.42
the intensity of it and the extremity is

2399.22 --> 2406.72
pretty much the same while in my

2403.42 --> 2410.529
experience I seem to be intellectually

2406.72 --> 2415.39
and skill-wise inside wise seem to be

2410.529 --> 2417.849
having more of a container to contain it

2415.39 --> 2419.95
now in relation to when I was young and

2417.849 --> 2423.4900000000002
there was just nothing to contain it's

2419.95 --> 2426.43
just raw chaos in a way your capacity is

2423.49 --> 2431.2889999999998
increased alright there's like this

2426.43 --> 2433.509
thing growing around it and that is

2431.289 --> 2435.9100000000003
comforting I that's a comforting idea

2433.509 --> 2437.23
because if yeah if that set sound that

2435.91 --> 2439.66
means that Wow

2437.23 --> 2441.09
does that mean that eventually it'll be

2439.66 --> 2444.45
just completely

2441.09 --> 2449.67
is that does that make sense is that

2444.45 --> 2457.2599999999998
like if they really allowed I don't know

2449.67 --> 2463.86
if I don't know but it just goes better

2457.26 --> 2467.3100000000004
at least and in reflection to past

2463.86 --> 2470.85
happenings yeah it's not the first time

2467.31 --> 2474.42
that I went completely nuts it

2470.85 --> 2479.4
completely nuts just when the feelings

2474.42 --> 2483.3
overwhelm you so much that you just yeah

2479.4 --> 2486.63
you just have to break through it and be

2483.3 --> 2491.04
irrational just that feeling to get it

2486.63 --> 2495.78
out yeah I mean it's the first time to

2491.04 --> 2498.15
us that we see you go through that right

2495.78 --> 2502.55
so it's the first time and I read in

2498.15 --> 2505.14
public I always like I've always yeah

2502.55 --> 2508.32
and that's the typical thing like when

2505.14 --> 2511.2599999999998
you go into that you like retract you

2508.32 --> 2513.3900000000003
close off from people you know and you

2511.26 --> 2515.55
go to some like little corner or

2513.39 --> 2518.46
whatever almost like a cat finding a

2515.55 --> 2521.5800000000004
place to die away from everywhere and

2518.46 --> 2525.3
there you go nuts well and then it's

2521.58 --> 2531.09
like over ins like oh hey go back to my

2525.3 --> 2535.23
life again yeah so for some people it's

2531.09 --> 2538.9500000000003
it's literally over they they take that

2535.23 --> 2541.68
last step if they're that desperate or

2538.95 --> 2544.02
for some for whatever thoughts are going

2541.68 --> 2547.1699999999996
through their mind at the time that they

2544.02 --> 2555.09
are convinced are absolutely true and

2547.17 --> 2560.88
final I mean I I've been there but hope

2555.09 --> 2563.21
and faith and and observation got me

2560.88 --> 2563.21
through

2564.41 --> 2570.6299999999997
you know when you've got something that

2567.809 --> 2572.52
you know is holding you not just that

2570.63 --> 2580.9500000000003
you're holding on to but that is

2572.52 --> 2585.27
actually holding you and showing the

2580.95 --> 2589.02
being showing that they are perfectly

2585.27 --> 2591.18
capable of taking care of you

2589.02 --> 2594.03
in spite of this storm and through the

2591.18 --> 2600.2999999999997
storm then you you know you sit there go

2594.03 --> 2605.329
okay let's do this another day comes

2600.3 --> 2612.8390000000004
another day when you just get stronger

2605.329 --> 2617.55
I'm by no means a visibly strong person

2612.839 --> 2621.66
my strength is all inside if I only had

2617.55 --> 2625.29
this vessel to rely on I am so out of

2621.66 --> 2630.5989999999997
luck this body's been through the

2625.29 --> 2634.38
wringer but what's inside me what it's

2630.599 --> 2640.6400000000003
alive is just getting stronger and more

2634.38 --> 2645.839
apparent more brilliant let's say

2640.64 --> 2648.5
shining more and it is written that one

2645.839 --> 2653.849
day that's gonna be what's really

2648.5 --> 2655.849
visible right it the reality is what's

2653.849 --> 2662.94
gonna shine through not just our

2655.849 --> 2665.88
physical manifestation right so all

2662.94 --> 2670.339
you're showing everyone is that there is

2665.88 --> 2673.92
more to life than what is apparent

2670.339 --> 2676.23
around your neighborhood or hurt in your

2673.92 --> 2678.869
in your city or whatever it's something

2676.23 --> 2684.2400000000002
different it's not a physical thing it's

2678.869 --> 2687.4500000000003
it's much greater and it's not tangible

2684.24 --> 2689.58
right it's spiritual and it is it's real

2687.45 --> 2693.48
true within the

2689.58 --> 2699.2599999999998
experience itself well that is what

2693.48 --> 2702.36
spiritually a spiritual really is yeah

2699.26 --> 2704.3700000000003
then I do indeed it's an earthly that

2702.36 --> 2707.3
out it it's like another straight

2704.37 --> 2709.5499999999997
opposition to materialism to isolate

2707.3 --> 2714.75
isolationists deduction ists

2709.55 --> 2717.42
reductionism thinking and yeah say it's

2714.75 --> 2721.77
like no it's all connected like yeah

2717.42 --> 2724.98
everything and it's Beyond and greater

2721.77 --> 2725.97
and deeper than mere existence it's one

2724.98 --> 2731.25
thing to say

2725.97 --> 2736.6499999999996
okay that tree it's a living thing does

2731.25 --> 2740.52
that have a soul I don't know I know

2736.65 --> 2742.05
that if I kill it it will die but I

2740.52 --> 2745.47
don't know what happens after that other

2742.05 --> 2748.26
than to watch it decay and return back

2745.47 --> 2752.97
to the earth and feed what's coming up

2748.26 --> 2756.3900000000003
behind it do I do that in a way yeah I

2752.97 --> 2758.04
do but that's just the physical

2756.39 --> 2761.67
manifestation part what about the

2758.04 --> 2764.88
essence that was in it what about when

2761.67 --> 2768.7200000000003
my body can't sustain itself anymore and

2764.88 --> 2770.9100000000003
stops working what happens well there's

2768.72 --> 2776.06
there's something that does happen

2770.91 --> 2781.62
because the physical manifestation stops

2776.06 --> 2785.37
being in a way that we can see it right

2781.62 --> 2788.72
you can tell that something has happened

2785.37 --> 2791.4
and we call it death but we also

2788.72 --> 2795.48
understand it's it's a stepping stone it

2791.4 --> 2801.03
- it's a change of a passageway into

2795.48 --> 2807.2400000000002
something and you know because life by

2801.03 --> 2809.94
definition is it's a relaxing the

2807.24 --> 2812.16
manifestations of that life can be

2809.94 --> 2818.6
different and I don't mean in the in the

2812.16 --> 2818.6
terms of recycling but as a continuum

2819.22 --> 2827.3799999999997
but right yeah yeah a being who is not

2823.48 --> 2831.13
under the control of time doesn't

2827.38 --> 2837.4300000000003
operate in the limitations of time like

2831.13 --> 2840.4
we do and it's a temporary thing so it's

2837.43 --> 2843.2999999999997
a construct it's an experience it's a

2840.4 --> 2864.4300000000003
it's a measure it's you know it's just

2843.3 --> 2870.76
it's temporary it's a cycle like a

2864.43 --> 2876.8999999999996
mirror some like describe it is

2870.76 --> 2880.96
elliptical or or I don't know it

2876.9 --> 2889.29
progresses it increases while other

2880.96 --> 2893.02
things get reduced I mean it's very

2889.29 --> 2896.02
susceptible to one's perceptions but

2893.02 --> 2903.7599999999998
your perceptions can change they can

2896.02 --> 2907.27
broaden you can deepen and really when

2903.76 --> 2911.5200000000004
you're trying to explain a greater

2907.27 --> 2914.98
reality that isn't visible to people who

2911.52 --> 2916.69
haven't experienced it or or simply

2914.98 --> 2920.2
aren't aware of it even though it's

2916.69 --> 2923.56
going on right around them it's it's

2920.2 --> 2929.3489999999997
like another language it's it's hard to

2923.56 --> 2931.2
translate they have they have to you

2929.349 --> 2934.53
know they have to take baby steps right

2931.2 --> 2937.06
and and to make observations and

2934.53 --> 2941.2900000000004
understand what those experiences are

2937.06 --> 2943.66
and get them into a context and a frame

2941.29 --> 2944.47
of reference and again we're back to

2943.66 --> 2948.819
science

2944.47 --> 2952.0
you can science your life you can figure

2948.819 --> 2953.98
things out Arwen right you don't

2952.0 --> 2957.73
they'll have someone completely breaking

2953.98 --> 2960.97
it down for you you have a mind and you

2957.73 --> 2963.55
can use it you can process things and

2960.97 --> 2966.7599999999998
how it is gonna completely break it down

2963.55 --> 2969.07
for you won't guarantee what happens

2966.76 --> 2971.2000000000003
you're gonna take a part of it

2969.07 --> 2973.63
make it your own and discard the rest

2971.2 --> 2978.2799999999997
nobody's ever gonna take the whole thing

2973.63 --> 2981.2200000000003
as is exact ever does nobody ever does

2978.28 --> 2985.96
that every individual has their own

2981.22 --> 2988.06
perspective on everything right and

2985.96 --> 2990.369
their moments when they are ready to

2988.06 --> 2993.67
engage in some specific field of

2990.369 --> 2998.77
information when before that it would be

2993.67 --> 3001.29
too too hot to handle or they just do

2998.77 --> 3005.22
not see it they couldn't see it before

3001.29 --> 3006.81
so everything arrives just yeah again

3005.22 --> 3008.3999999999996
and again until you're ready to either

3006.81 --> 3012.66
see it or handle it

3008.4 --> 3016.4700000000003
and then you do then before you just

3012.66 --> 3020.1499999999996
don't see it or you're scared of it and

3016.47 --> 3020.1499999999996
you run away from it either

3022.21 --> 3032.98
also the the awareness like geez I keep

3028.43 --> 3036.8599999999997
having conversations with people who

3032.98 --> 3041.81
insist that what we see on the outside

3036.86 --> 3047.53
or our nationality our social status or

3041.81 --> 3053.45
our our origins have greater meaning

3047.53 --> 3058.21
than our present state or our process of

3053.45 --> 3063.4399999999996
growth and I find it difficult to

3058.21 --> 3069.17
communicate that skin color is a is an

3063.44 --> 3072.29
experience they think for example well

3069.17 --> 3074.3
we were once in charge of the world then

3072.29 --> 3074.6
the whites came along and took it all

3074.3 --> 3077.6600000000003
away

3074.6 --> 3080.0
and now we want to get it back and we'll

3077.66 --> 3082.27
just do to them what they did to us oh

3080.0 --> 3085.22
it always works

3082.27 --> 3088.5099999999998
repeat rinse and repeat rinse and repeat

3085.22 --> 3093.4399999999996
and so I kept asking so what makes you

3088.51 --> 3097.01
any different or better than your

3093.44 --> 3100.01
so-called enemies of whites which I am

3097.01 --> 3103.7900000000004
one yeah and you and even theoretically

3100.01 --> 3107.6800000000003
asked like yeah how did your people

3103.79 --> 3111.5
actually become the rulers how many

3107.68 --> 3113.6
tribes or other colored people or even

3111.5 --> 3117.13
all their beings that you get out of the

3113.6 --> 3122.0299999999997
way to establish that it's always

3117.13 --> 3128.09
something how much history do we really

3122.03 --> 3131.1200000000003
know right or so they're there's so many

3128.09 --> 3134.6600000000003
contradictions that it's hard to nail

3131.12 --> 3137.12
down so again I keep encouraging them in

3134.66 --> 3139.43
some of them the ones who invited me to

3137.12 --> 3142.0699999999997
join the group to have the conversation

3139.43 --> 3145.37
who said you have something to

3142.07 --> 3147.26
contribute and we need it I keep racking

3145.37 --> 3150.77
my brain what is it that you're wanting

3147.26 --> 3153.4900000000002
from me and then it dawned on me what

3150.77 --> 3157.359
has been my message what has been

3153.49 --> 3161.0499999999997
my communication this was from people in

3157.359 --> 3165.66
Twitter asking me to join a group so I

3161.05 --> 3168.4
had to just overview what I had said

3165.66 --> 3171.7599999999998
over the past two years that would have

3168.4 --> 3175.51
caused these particular people to have

3171.76 --> 3179.7700000000004
an interest so I began to understand my

3175.51 --> 3185.6400000000003
message has been unity but over

3179.77 --> 3190.589
commonality not over not demanding

3185.64 --> 3196.5
uniformity uniformity is what is global

3190.589 --> 3200.44
that's globalism it requires compromise

3196.5 --> 3205.589
instead of integrity it compromises

3200.44 --> 3210.13
one's integrity it compromises one's

3205.589 --> 3213.25
individuality of course and it requires

3210.13 --> 3216.52
that you surrender your sovereignty

3213.25 --> 3219.28
rights exactly you need so they would

3216.52 --> 3223.78
demand this you basically surrender your

3219.28 --> 3226.96
purpose and the collective becomes your

3223.78 --> 3228.9700000000003
personal purpose is nothing to do with

3226.96 --> 3233.619
you as an individual what is good or

3228.97 --> 3236.859
what is bad for you and that is yeah

3233.619 --> 3241.15
that is the the greatest sacrifice date

3236.859 --> 3246.779
a minute you yourself your

3241.15 --> 3251.73
own individual being your spirit you

3246.779 --> 3256.9
know each one of us is part of a whole

3251.73 --> 3262.7400000000002
right and all nationalities all nations

3256.9 --> 3266.26
are part of a whole and there is to be

3262.74 --> 3272.0789999999997
the goal the ideal is for there to be a

3266.26 --> 3275.8590000000004
balance there should be a harmony it's

3272.079 --> 3279.46
it's a symphony it is not a single note

3275.859 --> 3284.17
or a single melody it's a harmony it's a

3279.46 --> 3289.029
symphony of humanity all right so when

3284.17 --> 3292.029
when humans interfere with environmental

3289.029 --> 3299.529
balance or equilibrium what happens

3292.029 --> 3303.63
chaos right sorry what happened what

3299.529 --> 3306.49
happens when something or someone

3303.63 --> 3310.029
interferes with the balance of humanity

3306.49 --> 3315.25
of of the symphony of the whole of all

3310.029 --> 3317.98
nationalities of humanity as a whole we

3315.25 --> 3324.27
get chaos to get somebody saying I'm the

3317.98 --> 3328.029
boss not you you're my slave right and

3324.27 --> 3330.43
it it all makes sense to me how is the

3328.029 --> 3334.029
world supposed to be balanced if only

3330.43 --> 3338.89
one nation is going to be in charge I

3334.029 --> 3341.52
don't like what the US does I don't

3338.89 --> 3345.7
think it's right for there to be an

3341.52 --> 3350.2
imperial presence in the world of one

3345.7 --> 3354.0
nation right agree to that it's sense

3350.2 --> 3357.3999999999996
we're under God therefore I'm like who

3354.0 --> 3361.079
that's a that's a misnomer if I ever

3357.4 --> 3365.92
heard one which God are you under what

3361.079 --> 3367.8900000000003
exactly are you about America what do

3365.92 --> 3373.4990000000003
you know them by their actions

3367.89 --> 3378.8089999999997
that's always the truth oh it's one of

3373.499 --> 3381.6299999999997
those principles that yeah like control

3378.809 --> 3383.6400000000003
hates that because no matter what they

3381.63 --> 3387.69
do no matter how they indoctrinate all

3383.64 --> 3390.69
that it always remains you know them by

3387.69 --> 3393.239
their actions they can say anything they

3390.69 --> 3399.39
can make any dream bring up any excuse

3393.239 --> 3401.509
but their actions it's yeah what what

3399.39 --> 3405.8689999999997
you do behind your closed doors actually

3401.509 --> 3406.38
matters and sorry for the traffic noise

3405.869 --> 3410.7000000000003
here

3406.38 --> 3416.279
um I can't hear it oh good it only

3410.7 --> 3419.9399999999996
bothers me what three first no it's not

3416.279 --> 3424.44
just the United States exactly it's not

3419.94 --> 3426.69
it's everything like there's what I'm

3424.44 --> 3432.059
hearing from China what they're doing is

3426.69 --> 3434.9
also too much well no way what I feel

3432.059 --> 3438.3190000000004
like what's happening in Europe is is

3434.9 --> 3442.529
also too much it's like everything

3438.319 --> 3443.519
they're all pushing it yeah and I don't

3442.529 --> 3448.47
get it

3443.519 --> 3451.68
I don't get it why why are you doing

3448.47 --> 3455.8799999999997
that it doesn't make any damn sense why

3451.68 --> 3459.8999999999996
are you basically guaranteeing your own

3455.88 --> 3462.6600000000003
instruction that's that's the tip-off

3459.9 --> 3466.14
right there that is the symptom that

3462.66 --> 3468.6189999999997
tells you what the sickness is can you

3466.14 --> 3468.6189999999997
get it

3471.65 --> 3479.19
why why I know that I would mention well

3476.46 --> 3481.83
why would NASA live it's it's always

3479.19 --> 3484.4700000000003
that question why would they do this you

3481.83 --> 3489.41
got to get underneath and behind it all

3484.47 --> 3492.93
to get into that what is their goal

3489.41 --> 3495.24
it's obviously not Pro humanity because

3492.93 --> 3498.45
if they were probably meant they

3495.24 --> 3501.45
wouldn't be out out and about my destroy

3498.45 --> 3504.4199999999996
humanity well maybe it is the spell to

3501.45 --> 3507.93
just keep us all calm because just look

3504.42 --> 3512.25
at it what happens when somebody breaks

3507.93 --> 3517.23
through the conflict and causes

3512.25 --> 3520.47
disruption so basically we are they view

3517.23 --> 3525.5
us as rebels they view us as anarchists

3520.47 --> 3531.98
they view us as non conformists and

3525.5 --> 3534.75
protest ants Protestants protesters and

3531.98 --> 3537.9
whistleblowers we're all we do all that

3534.75 --> 3542.76
so we are a problem and we are the

3537.9 --> 3545.64
terrorists of the day against the the

3542.76 --> 3551.2200000000003
lies we are terror to the liars

3545.64 --> 3554.31
yeah right we're a problem there's

3551.22 --> 3557.1899999999996
nothing more reporting to a lie than the

3554.31 --> 3560.91
truth exactly so how do they propose to

3557.19 --> 3565.7000000000003
control it well they're doing it well

3560.91 --> 3565.7
they're trying they're trying but

3567.71 --> 3572.43
there's something greater than them

3570.12 --> 3576.27
though that doesn't allow them to have

3572.43 --> 3579.6
complete success so maybe I'm just

3576.27 --> 3581.37
wondering something it's my thing maybe

3579.6 --> 3583.23
that's why they're doing it maybe that's

3581.37 --> 3586.79
where they're trying to drive everything

3583.23 --> 3592.83
crazy in the hopes that people will

3586.79 --> 3596.2799999999997
blame the truthers I have an even

3592.83 --> 3603.24
funnier scenario they're projecting

3596.28 --> 3606.5400000000004
their rebellion on to us well if the

3603.24 --> 3611.0699999999997
truthers are after the truth and the

3606.54 --> 3615.7799999999997
truth sets you free and love casts out

3611.07 --> 3621.3
fear and life truly living is freedom

3615.78 --> 3624.57
then hello they are the ones rebelling

3621.3 --> 3627.0600000000004
against what is real and what is true

3624.57 --> 3630.63
and what is good and they're projecting

3627.06 --> 3634.29
their rebellion upon us they're saying

3630.63 --> 3637.37
we're defying their control but they're

3634.29 --> 3642.9
actually the ones who are defying the

3637.37 --> 3646.5299999999997
creator of this paradigm so they're the

3642.9 --> 3649.4100000000003
virus they're the bug and they're

3646.53 --> 3655.46
telling us that we are because we are

3649.41 --> 3659.24
disrupting their control it's so hard to

3655.46 --> 3659.2400000000002
understand no

3660.769 --> 3668.8489999999997
so no but then again Ultimates that

3666.239 --> 3671.2200000000003
collective point of view won't yeah I

3668.849 --> 3675.15
don't get that people have surrendered

3671.22 --> 3678.479
themselves to it for temporarily from a

3675.15 --> 3682.2290000000003
personal like like all these people like

3678.479 --> 3685.589
look at what you've got you know look

3682.229 --> 3688.41
what they're and then realize that yeah

3685.589 --> 3694.529
you're throwing that all away to select

3688.41 --> 3697.769
to basically help out some collective

3694.529 --> 3700.519
will that really from a human

3697.769 --> 3704.9399999999996
perspective doesn't make any damn sense

3700.519 --> 3707.97
they probably are I'm sure some of them

3704.94 --> 3711.029
if not all of them are putting their

3707.97 --> 3714.749
faith into a fantasy if they are

3711.029 --> 3718.349
convinced that this fantasy is real or

3714.749 --> 3721.95
that their fantasies will be fulfilled

3718.349 --> 3726.8900000000003
or satisfied in other words receiving

3721.95 --> 3731.3689999999997
promises or experiencing some pleasure

3726.89 --> 3733.44
you know yeah living the dream until

3731.369 --> 3738.719
they come to a point of understanding

3733.44 --> 3741.7490000000003
that that is not real it is not true and

3738.719 --> 3746.059
it's not living and that they are

3741.749 --> 3746.0589999999997
actually walking in a path towards Jeff

3746.569 --> 3754.529
they just keep on going they they don't

3749.9 --> 3757.92
value true living truth and and love

3754.529 --> 3758.609
they don't care they think they do but

3757.92 --> 3760.65
they don't

3758.609 --> 3763.609
and then they project that onto others

3760.65 --> 3767.069
because you're not cooperating with me

3763.609 --> 3772.499
well I refuse to cooperate

3767.069 --> 3774.989
I do not consent to hating people simply

3772.499 --> 3777.4399999999996
on their appearances or on their

3774.989 --> 3779.16
willingness or unwillingness to follow

3777.44 --> 3784.7000000000003
certain rules

3779.16 --> 3787.049
I believe in individuality I believe in

3784.7 --> 3789.989
freedom of speech freedom of thought

3787.049 --> 3793.21
freedom of religion if that's what it

3789.989 --> 3800.619
takes or some people want to label that

3793.21 --> 3803.049
of a freedom of Oh Constance dropped out

3800.619 --> 3803.789
maybe battery related so bad it was

3803.049 --> 3817.5389999999998
really good

3803.789 --> 3821.369
let's see if she comes back no joking

3817.539 --> 3821.369

3850.54 --> 3854.13
inconvenient time yeah I really

3855.28 --> 3860.44
let's hope constants comebacks comes

back

3863.36 --> 3866.9500000000003

3935.7 --> 3946.25
[Music]

hungry

3979.4 --> 3991.789
exam hey welcome back that was for me

3985.099 --> 3996.299
where was I I get your batteries drop

3991.789 --> 3999.199
was a connection issue what was it my

3996.299 --> 4003.92
battery I can't see my battery power

3999.199 --> 4010.5190000000002
indicator right so when it's about to go

4003.92 --> 4014.14
I get it too late so we were talking

4010.519 --> 4022.999
about let me see

4014.14 --> 4029.8689999999997
rebels I love this uh train of thought

4022.999 --> 4034.8999999999996
so I just did you get momentum again I

4029.869 --> 4034.9
was now you're talking about

4036.04 --> 4049.18
a fantasy they they believe in a fantasy

4046.33 --> 4055.41
they've been told a lie and they believe

4049.18 --> 4058.9199999999996
it and it's hard to onion doctrine eight

4055.41 --> 4062.5299999999997
someone who has been completely snowed

4058.92 --> 4064.03
completely immersed it that's all they

4062.53 --> 4067.3
know that's their whole completely

4064.03 --> 4071.26
surrender to the delusion yes they

4067.3 --> 4076.05
become like Matt it is a form of madness

4071.26 --> 4079.05
but somehow this madness can still

4076.05 --> 4079.05
function

4079.89 --> 4087.73
we designed to accommodate for you

4084.06 --> 4090.73
within the spring the realistic it opens

4087.73 --> 4092.86
see the system has been designed to

4090.73 --> 4100.15
accommodate for this madness

4092.86 --> 4104.08
Oh for that corruption it is crazy now

4100.15 --> 4109.29
because it is all like the madness is

4104.08 --> 4109.29
applauded yeah and that is just

4109.999 --> 4126.969
it's scary it is the whole world is a

4119.869 --> 4130.639
stage now you've got okay I know people

4126.969 --> 4138.369
in my childhood I met people who lived

4130.639 --> 4146.029
under Hitler's influence at the time and

4138.369 --> 4148.219
they told of how it was that you know

4146.029 --> 4154.299000000001
supposedly Germany was a Christian

4148.219 --> 4154.299
nation and the way to get them to

4154.809 --> 4162.92
disassociate from the Creator was okay

4159.469 --> 4165.259
let's let's deal with prayer so we want

4162.92 --> 4169.9400000000005
you all to pray to God for some candy

4165.259 --> 4173.119
and so the children this is children

4169.94 --> 4175.999
they're doing this - they're praying to

4173.119 --> 4179.989
God please send us some candy please

4175.999 --> 4183.049
Jesus send us some candy and nothing

4179.989 --> 4188.178999999999
happens right and then they say okay now

4183.049 --> 4190.609
pray to Hitler for some candy and from

4188.179 --> 4193.909
the ceiling of this place that they're

4190.609 --> 4197.269
in did they drop candy now this can be

4193.909 --> 4205.46
done that happened they did it oh my god

4197.269 --> 4209.479
that is so freaking this is so real you

4205.46 --> 4212.86
see the the mindfuck that that is that

4209.479 --> 4215.539000000001
is total Petofi and indoctrination

4212.86 --> 4221.299999999999
absolutely they know what they're doing

4215.539 --> 4224.289
so creepy and he did that yes they were

4221.3 --> 4229.789
they were indoctrinating those children

4224.289 --> 4232.57
to become to put the state in you know

4229.789 --> 4237.018999999999
the state the government in the place of

4232.57 --> 4240.38
God to them now in America we are under

4237.019 --> 4241.1900000000005
God we have the appearance of being

4240.38 --> 4244.85
under God

4241.19 --> 4248.629999999999
we have the motto of being under God but

4244.85 --> 4251.9800000000005
we are not we're not under the Creator

4248.63 --> 4260.51
were under the god of this world does

4251.98 --> 4268.969999999999
that not smack of subterfuge it's it's a

4260.51 --> 4271.58
farce it's a total farce or you could

4268.97 --> 4274.400000000001
see it oh by the way Thank You Sean

4271.58 --> 4278.62
Tibet's for the super chat donation very

4274.4 --> 4283.079
much appreciated and pounds nice but

4278.62 --> 4287.73
it's also in a way like

4283.079 --> 4291.989
I think the allure of the dream like

4287.73 --> 4295.44
yeah we will rule it we will keep it

4291.989 --> 4298.739
safe it's like yeah we will be the

4295.44 --> 4301.32
henchmen of the devil basically and try

4298.739 --> 4307.339999999999
to protect you from him as much as

4301.32 --> 4309.54
possible the devil engineers really

4307.34 --> 4315.6900000000005
because it's actually the other way

4309.54 --> 4318.63
around and that's that's the yeah in the

4315.69 --> 4320.638999999999
unsolvable puzzle about it really well

4318.63 --> 4324.4490000000005
first they'll tell you who that devil is

4320.639 --> 4330.7390000000005
and what what the appearance of the

4324.449 --> 4333.57
devil is like the world is a globe right

4330.739 --> 4335.489
okay and they'll tell you who the enemy

4333.57 --> 4338.369
is and they'll tell you what that enemy

4335.489 --> 4341.699
looks like so the enemy can be anybody

4338.369 --> 4345.54
it could be a person of a certain color

4341.699 --> 4349.23
or appearance or nationality or I mean

4345.54 --> 4352.86
come on who are the terrorists really is

4349.23 --> 4359.098999999999
it a religion is the terrorist

4352.86 --> 4364.199
a person who opposes government is it is

4359.099 --> 4369.59
it a terrorist that opposes conformity

4364.199 --> 4372.928999999999
and globalism am i a terrorist

4369.59 --> 4383.6990000000005
apparently I am to the liars I'm a

4372.929 --> 4387.57
terrorist no they keep projecting that

4383.699 --> 4388.949
image onto people anti-vaxxers are

4387.57 --> 4391.86
terrible what they want

4388.949 --> 4395.969
look how how you make terrorists how the

4391.86 --> 4398.848999999999
evil ones do it yeah take a group then

4395.969 --> 4402.0
you attack them you wait them to defend

4398.849 --> 4404.6990000000005
themselves against you and then you call

4402.0 --> 4407.94
them victims and then you deny that you

4404.699 --> 4409.29
started the attack exactly he did it he

4407.94 --> 4412.65
started it

4409.29 --> 4414.66
oh you have to respond be sure of the

4412.65 --> 4420.74
[ __ ] in the Middle East basic I started

4414.66 --> 4420.74
I mean it's it's so twisted and sick and

4423.08 --> 4432.11
bias is taught it is not natural it is

4428.46 --> 4435.42
taught a baby being born into this world

4432.11 --> 4442.25
would perceive we're all connected we

4435.42 --> 4451.35
are all human we're not you know life

4442.25 --> 4458.7
life is the commonality and you don't

4451.35 --> 4461.34
set out to kill life if you love you

4458.7 --> 4463.53
don't do that if you're if you know what

4461.34 --> 4469.2
it is to truly live you don't do that

4463.53 --> 4472.05
you respect life and the inside of you

4469.2 --> 4475.8
that drives you to do it yeah right you

4472.05 --> 4479.97
may let that happen or you can just try

4475.8 --> 4483.6
to heal it that - I mean you have to

4479.97 --> 4487.35
give it right it's very tough though it

4483.6 --> 4490.89
like of course destroying is much

4487.35 --> 4498.120000000001
quicker much easier than actually trying

4490.89 --> 4502.650000000001
to heal the cause it's again but it's

4498.12 --> 4505.44
it's infinitely more rewarding it is you

4502.65 --> 4509.07
don't create like blood feuds in the

4505.44 --> 4512.549999999999
process which brings literally curses

4509.07 --> 4513.45
upon yourself and others young

4512.55 --> 4519.14
generations

4513.45 --> 4523.7
it echoes back the baby what you did

4519.14 --> 4530.6900000000005
what happens echoes back yeah it's the

4523.7 --> 4533.15
spirits of your ancestors mm-hmm and so

4530.69 --> 4536.65
yeah everything like oh you think oh

4533.15 --> 4539.36
yeah you know they'll get a no chance no

4536.65 --> 4544.07
everything every single thing every

4539.36 --> 4551.599999999999
damned and blessed thing you do echoes

4544.07 --> 4557.17
back you there is no there is no thing

4551.6 --> 4557.17
you can do outside of that mm-hmm

4557.68 --> 4562.04
so we didn't know there's nothing you

4560.03 --> 4564.62
can really do in secret outside of it

4562.04 --> 4570.68
all except me that's for sure except

4564.62 --> 4573.65
maybe in your imagination yeah beautiful

4570.68 --> 4576.26
okay because in reality because

4573.65 --> 4581.0
everything is connected it reveals

4576.26 --> 4584.6
itself by its fruit and by its effects

4581.0 --> 4589.34
and so even what you did in secret ends

4584.6 --> 4591.29
up becoming revealed so it's inevitable

4589.34 --> 4594.400000000001
and that's what I tell my children

4591.29 --> 4601.49
there's no such thing as true privacy

4594.4 --> 4604.04
because we reveal right and it can't be

4601.49 --> 4608.84
hidden it won't remain hidden for long

4604.04 --> 4611.03
and some things might be found out only

4608.84 --> 4616.85
after you were no longer breathing

4611.03 --> 4621.32
but they have an effect and once someone

4616.85 --> 4624.740000000001
discovers what was done in in secret it

4621.32 --> 4627.92
changes their view of how they perceive

4624.74 --> 4630.92
right the whole engines it change even

4627.92 --> 4633.83
after you're gone changes are happening

4630.92 --> 4637.1
in people's impression of your life of

4633.83 --> 4641.51
your essen right and this farm if their

4637.1 --> 4644.09
memory it's we can feed this back pretty

4641.51 --> 4645.400000000001
easily like total concept of the

4644.09 --> 4649.14
astronauts with the

4645.4 --> 4652.2699999999995
landing their worship and now it's like

4649.14 --> 4657.37
sinking more in and in it's like oh yeah

4652.27 --> 4660.64
that was all an illusion oh and all that

4657.37 --> 4663.67
praise is all now gone mutes basically

4660.64 --> 4667.51
or is going mute slightly and this just

4663.67 --> 4670.54
embarrassment and like sadness like I

4667.51 --> 4672.820000000001
feel pity for them like honest pity not

4670.54 --> 4676.659
like ooh you're disgusting but like oh

4672.82 --> 4678.549999999999
my god they had to carry that [ __ ] home

4676.659 --> 4682.989
and they did it for a really good

4678.55 --> 4686.29
reasons but my god that's such a massive

4682.989 --> 4690.19
burden to be worshipped for something

4686.29 --> 4694.199
you know is a lie and you do it for the

4690.19 --> 4694.199
country or something you know my god

4695.48 --> 4701.509999999999
yeah and buzz aldrin you know it's like

4698.21 --> 4704.57
the best he's a walking billboard for it

4701.51 --> 4707.6
yeah and and I think it's kind of

4704.57 --> 4711.44
beautiful as well because there's just

4707.6 --> 4714.14
like this weird honesty now radiating

4711.44 --> 4717.679999999999
off him that he can't control yeah he

4714.14 --> 4720.77
can't he's he's losing control although

4717.68 --> 4723.9800000000005
he's been Lou he's not he's not acting

4720.77 --> 4728.120000000001
out on it really but he not just it's

4723.98 --> 4730.37
just it's just like hell hell yeah

4728.12 --> 4734.78
that's that's what I see it's someone

4730.37 --> 4737.599999999999
begging for either help or to be

4734.78 --> 4741.44
released from this from the burden of it

4737.6 --> 4745.160000000001
all I'm the curse well there's only one

4741.44 --> 4751.429999999999
can they please just say what happened

4745.16 --> 4752.8099999999995
oh and then I'm finally done with it and

4751.43 --> 4755.030000000001
I could just be a normal human being

4752.81 --> 4761.030000000001
again that's probably what he must feel

4755.03 --> 4763.94
like he's in a prison built by not just

4761.03 --> 4768.889999999999
himself but a construct

4763.94 --> 4772.7
you know it's he's he's pressed upon

4768.89 --> 4777.9800000000005
he's demanded to live up to this imagery

4772.7 --> 4781.61
and this projection and he's he is

4777.98 --> 4784.25
suffering but in a sense he seems to

4781.61 --> 4786.74
enjoy some of it so that he doesn't want

4784.25 --> 4791.08
to give it all up cuz you can if he

4786.74 --> 4793.49
wants to maybe you know the Pens know

4791.08 --> 4797.8099999999995
there's some dark people on the other

4793.49 --> 4804.65
side there as well that's all it takes

4797.81 --> 4808.070000000001
one step one turn one no to the wrong

4804.65 --> 4811.339999999999
and say yes to the right and he can

4808.07 --> 4815.0
start his path back to normalcy or back

4811.34 --> 4817.27
to sanity because it is insane to live

4815.0 --> 4817.27
that way

4818.03 --> 4822.2
that is the definition of insanity it

4821.15 --> 4827.259999999999
doesn't make sense

4822.2 --> 4830.15
it is painful and he's not a free person

4827.26 --> 4838.99
he's completely imprisoned in his in

4830.15 --> 4842.45
this construct the pleasures are

4838.99 --> 4848.48
temporary satisfaction I'm pretty sure

4842.45 --> 4852.0199999999995
he's not a happy man not a happy man I'm

4848.48 --> 4855.889999999999
just to be kind of weird I'm just

4852.02 --> 4859.67
wondering like how amazing would it be

4855.89 --> 4862.160000000001
to have in secret though like but

4859.67 --> 4864.37
flat-earthers that really get it and

4862.16 --> 4867.38
just have a talk with him and like

4864.37 --> 4869.48
actually help him like yeah we get it

4867.38 --> 4874.9400000000005
you're trapped in here you know we get

4869.48 --> 4879.349999999999
it it's okay you can be yourself with us

4874.94 --> 4881.24
at least and we is a fantasy because to

4879.35 --> 4884.8
so many flatters and look probably gonna

4881.24 --> 4888.139999999999
be like oh the ultimate opportunity and

4884.8 --> 4895.04
that's a problem but I just feel for the

4888.14 --> 4898.18
guy at this points like oh my god yeah

4895.04 --> 4902.18
the reality is he swore a blood oath and

4898.18 --> 4905.6900000000005
he knows you vowed that he would forfeit

4902.18 --> 4907.87
in his life if he ever went back on him

4905.69 --> 4907.87
off

4910.92 --> 4921.07
and he will defend the lie to his dying

4915.55 --> 4924.34
breath unless he chooses to put more

4921.07 --> 4927.96
value on truth and everlasting life than

4924.34 --> 4933.7300000000005
on this temporary life that he has and

4927.96 --> 4940.15
to love truth more than his own life

4933.73 --> 4946.629999999999
experience at this time that is the crux

4940.15 --> 4948.879999999999
of it all he's made his choice he can

4946.63 --> 4956.559
choose differently it will cost him

4948.88 --> 4961.150000000001
either way but the rewards far greater

4956.559 --> 4964.570000000001
and eternal and he has to make that

4961.15 --> 4973.57
choice and at this point he think has

4964.57 --> 4976.84
made that choice yeah he's on the path

4973.57 --> 4979.389
that he is chosen so right you can get

4976.84 --> 4982.51
off of it but it'll cost I believe

4979.389 --> 4986.01
well can he not get off of it is that

4982.51 --> 4988.96
even a possibility you know it's

4986.01 --> 4991.869000000001
possible we'll just be driven from the

4988.96 --> 4995.38
inside it's not unstoppable I don't know

4991.869 --> 4997.829
it it almost feels like that like it's

4995.38 --> 4997.829
just the

4998.44 --> 5012.089999999999
well it it's he's like a living example

5008.04 --> 5014.91
of a disconnect from the Creator now

5012.09 --> 5019.02
when they go into the Masonic

5014.91 --> 5022.47
Brotherhood the Freemasons only want

5019.02 --> 5025.35
people who believe in God or a God they

5022.47 --> 5028.2
don't want a theists they need to have

5025.35 --> 5031.650000000001
that connection and we have to have that

5028.2 --> 5035.19
that level of commitment from this

5031.65 --> 5039.629999999999
person who will do anything literally

5035.19 --> 5046.799999999999
anything to achieve a goal to perform

5039.63 --> 5049.89
certain duties and to protect the the

5046.8 --> 5053.6
Society of these free mate the

5049.89 --> 5053.6
Brotherhood so

5056.41 --> 5062.29
he believes what he believes and if he

5059.17 --> 5069.88
is at the level where he has experienced

5062.29 --> 5074.5
the supernatural maybe even visibly then

5069.88 --> 5078.07
he knows that the the very words I want

5074.5 --> 5081.94
to stop this or I don't want this

5078.07 --> 5084.969999999999
anymore will have repercussions in the

5081.94 --> 5092.29
spiritual realm and the boomerang or the

5084.97 --> 5096.52
the the the effect will be made felt in

5092.29 --> 5098.17
his physical experience here and that's

5096.52 --> 5101.950000000001
what I mean he's that he would have to

5098.17 --> 5107.56
choose and understand which he does that

5101.95 --> 5111.13
he there will be an effect now as I see

5107.56 --> 5116.92
it the greater power which is the

5111.13 --> 5124.6
creator he has the final say right and

5116.92 --> 5129.43
his valiant is consideration is on the

5124.6 --> 5132.67
fruit it's on your intention it's it's a

5129.43 --> 5135.16
higher judgment than ours we don't know

5132.67 --> 5138.84
what buzz is thinking we don't know what

5135.16 --> 5146.32
he wants we don't know what he's doing

5138.84 --> 5148.93
to counteract the evil one we don't see

5146.32 --> 5151.9
any fruit I have no idea they're like

5148.93 --> 5155.29
yeah I indeed you just get to see him

5151.9 --> 5158.41
sometimes no idea what he's up it's very

5155.29 --> 5161.65
well guard where he's dwelling what

5158.41 --> 5163.51
people he's being subjected to if he's

5161.65 --> 5166.379999999999
left to peace or if they're actually

5163.51 --> 5169.150000000001
trying to drive him even more insane

5166.38 --> 5172.650000000001
that's why they call him handlers he's

5169.15 --> 5177.12
got people who keep an eye on him

5172.65 --> 5180.129999999999
take him out he's always well guarded

5177.12 --> 5184.2699999999995
got two two bodyguards something like

5180.13 --> 5187.7300000000005
that get him where he's got to go and as

5184.27 --> 5191.06
soon as the event is over he's taken

5187.73 --> 5195.5599999999995
back he doesn't go anywhere by himself

5191.06 --> 5202.34
and he literally knows what it means to

5195.56 --> 5206.080000000001
have no privacy and the president is the

5202.34 --> 5215.06
same way the president is always watched

5206.08 --> 5219.23
there's no such thing as privacy to be

5215.06 --> 5221.81
fair is there anything like real privacy

5219.23 --> 5224.45
or was that I don't think so it's just

5221.81 --> 5229.700000000001
every woman everyone an illusion make a

5224.45 --> 5235.2699999999995
comforting idea yes there's a because

5229.7 --> 5239.51
there's the illusion of privacy yeah

5235.27 --> 5242.030000000001
like I think it should be there yeah but

5239.51 --> 5245.0
I've given up the concept ten years ago

5242.03 --> 5249.05
well it's just like choosing like how

5245.0 --> 5251.239
much would you like to be observed mm

5249.05 --> 5253.400000000001
yeah with everything you try to connect

5251.239 --> 5256.61
you also become observed they also

5253.4 --> 5260.089999999999
collect data it's just a it's a

5256.61 --> 5261.95
one-on-one some with everything it's

5260.09 --> 5264.8
like oh you want the advantage of this

5261.95 --> 5268.88
thing well you're gonna be taken

5264.8 --> 5273.02
advantage of on an equal level and

5268.88 --> 5276.86
everything everything out there no

5273.02 --> 5282.7390000000005
matter what you do everything will seek

5276.86 --> 5284.599999999999
to achieve its equilibrium and as long

5282.739 --> 5287.299999999999
as there's someone stirring up that pot

5284.6 --> 5289.370000000001
and trying to make waves and then

5287.3 --> 5291.35
telling you okay now we're gonna control

5289.37 --> 5293.45
those waves so that you no longer

5291.35 --> 5297.71
experience the chaos and then they'll

5293.45 --> 5299.48
give you a temporary reprieve and you

5297.71 --> 5301.97
become grateful towards them because

5299.48 --> 5307.5199999999995
they controlled the storm right that

5301.97 --> 5311.030000000001
they themselves created excuse me right

5307.52 --> 5313.3
yes you'd be on that behind that door

5311.03 --> 5313.3
there

5314.65 --> 5326.11
but yeah yeah you're right that's always

5323.54 --> 5328.5199999999995
accelerating having you on constants

5326.11 --> 5330.4
cool thank you for being part of this

5328.52 --> 5340.400000000001
show I think I'm gonna round out it's

5330.4 --> 5343.48
after 3:00 so thanks for having me it's

5340.4 --> 5346.79
been a pleasure and I've missed you guys

5343.48 --> 5349.879999999999
yeah yeah I hope your your job is

5346.79 --> 5353.33
working out everything is that going

5349.88 --> 5357.38
four days straight and I was about dead

5353.33 --> 5359.8099999999995
on my feet but now I get two days off

5357.38 --> 5364.39
and then I'm on two days and a day off

5359.81 --> 5369.68
in two days so that's one kind of flier

5364.39 --> 5374.87
I'll be with you in a minute okay no

5369.68 --> 5380.2300000000005
he's doing some fixing in his room all

5374.87 --> 5384.23
right so yeah I hope to have you back in

5380.23 --> 5387.86
the near future or not Vincent's future

5384.23 --> 5392.23
at least it's always good to have you

5387.86 --> 5396.86
and gives me some breathing room as well

5392.23 --> 5401.169999999999
that's true because yeah you do enter

5396.86 --> 5401.17
like the same level of deep thinking and

5402.34 --> 5408.67
it's good to basically look at somebody

5406.599 --> 5411.75
else doing it and adding on to it it's

5408.67 --> 5414.34
actually something I'm more trained at

5411.75 --> 5418.57
well cuz I always used to do that like I

5414.34 --> 5423.099
had a big brother very smart and I'd be

5418.57 --> 5424.139
his assistance in that intelligence very

5423.099 --> 5427.929
good at it

5424.139 --> 5431.469
and they had done that specific type of

5427.929 --> 5434.65
process that transforming process done

5431.469 --> 5438.159
that all my life and it's much more

5434.65 --> 5443.079
difficult to be the one actually at the

5438.159 --> 5446.5
top it's more it's I can do it but it's

5443.079 --> 5454.48
not as efficient for me as when I'm not

5446.5 --> 5458.849
Oh guess that makes me a better well it

5454.48 --> 5463.36
takes all kinds as piece of things and

5458.849 --> 5466.179
again we're not all the same we all have

5463.36 --> 5469.299999999999
different strengths different functions

5466.179 --> 5471.969
and we have purpose and there's nothing

5469.3 --> 5475.539
greater than fulfilling that purpose and

5471.969 --> 5477.429
absolutely knowing that you're doing the

5475.539 --> 5481.119
right thing and in the right place and

5477.429 --> 5484.389
you're in the right time so yeah I wish

5481.119 --> 5488.469
you continued success at that and that

5484.389 --> 5493.4400000000005
may your declarations be true accurate

5488.469 --> 5497.949
like an arrow hitting the target your

5493.44 --> 5501.4
perceptions always be sharpened and you

5497.949 --> 5507.428999999999
know that a lot of warrior thank you

5501.4 --> 5516.339999999999
yeah you too thank you all right get

5507.429 --> 5519.34
this everybody and big hug with you I'm

5516.34 --> 5529.9400000000005
gonna round out the show

5537.26 --> 5541.85
interesting show we're gonna have to

5539.6 --> 5545.9490000000005
watch this one back because there was

5541.85 --> 5549.650000000001
just so much information going around

5545.949 --> 5554.48
again that yeah

5549.65 --> 5557.78
as it goes can maybe absorb like 50 to

5554.48 --> 5560.629999999999
75% of it and the rest just slips past

5557.78 --> 5563.66
me because I'm in the works of actually

5560.63 --> 5566.900000000001
producing and building this thoughts

5563.66 --> 5569.86
train so you can all see it as you're

5566.9 --> 5572.839999999999
building it so I will be watching back

5569.86 --> 5575.21
but yeah thank you everyone in chat it's

5572.84 --> 5579.89
been a quite a crowded chat some good

5575.21 --> 5586.719

troll there was some weird activity

5664.61 --> 5671.46
concerning that yesterday cuz I look

5666.99 --> 5674.79
back and yeah after the show and it had

5671.46 --> 5679.05
zero of folks not that it's all an

5674.79 --> 5681.72
important but that was artificial didn't

5679.05 --> 5684.150000000001
make any damn sense it was kept on a

5681.72 --> 5686.67
zero for some reason I don't know why I

5684.15 --> 5689.159

5701.15 --> 5706.409
