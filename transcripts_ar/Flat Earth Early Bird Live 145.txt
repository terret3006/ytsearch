7.17 --> 41.65
[Music]

37.53 --> 45.61
good morning welcome to flat earther

41.65 --> 49.75
early-bird number 145 I'm your host

45.61 --> 56.26
Arwen and today that's kind of an odd

49.75 --> 61.44
day it is not very wet it's not windy

56.26 --> 61.44
but it's cold it's a bit gray

68.01 --> 76.59
yeah yesterday was a bit messy for me in

70.86 --> 82.32
several fronts confrontation with slick

76.59 --> 84.81
James and oh yeah I messed up my

82.32 --> 87.72
newspaper round or rather I didn't

84.81 --> 89.42
really do that or I think I didn't but I

87.72 --> 93.63
basically didn't do it

89.42 --> 96.81
because yeah they were left out in the

93.63 --> 99.11999999999999
storm when they were delivered and I

96.81 --> 101.22
don't know if I didn't notice the bill

99.12 --> 105.30000000000001
the bell ringing or they just didn't do

101.22 --> 107.34
it I was left out in the storm it was

105.3 --> 111.39
just that two-thirds of everything was

107.34 --> 115.38
just completely wasted so yeah feels

111.39 --> 120.36
kind of weird not doing that what can

115.38 --> 122.72
you do I even notified the company so so

120.36 --> 128.179
let's use in chat

122.72 --> 133.07999999999998
Laurel JL Jewess good morning

128.179 --> 138.72
good question by the way Mandela effect

133.08 --> 144.03
related world peace and glass sha over

138.72 --> 149.54
moco Cleary 101 rock hound the ghost of

144.03 --> 149.54
foreign sergeant IRA killed the hope

152.849 --> 163.92
good morning to your so yeah I think I

161.579 --> 169.37900000000002
know for sure is I should definitely cut

163.92 --> 178.73899999999998
down on the smoking [ __ ] it's been very

169.379 --> 190.07899999999998
enjoyable but ya need to stop giving

178.739 --> 192.419
into the spring feeling yeah so yeah the

190.079 --> 198.9
situation was slick James yesterday it

192.419 --> 203.329
was kind of weird I did the I basically

198.9 --> 207.06
showed on my show these guys messaging

203.329 --> 209.84900000000002
and select James was really really

207.06 --> 211.81900000000002
pissed off about that like it was

209.849 --> 214.67999999999998
private

211.819 --> 217.73899999999998
even though yeah a lot of people get to

214.68 --> 220.28
see that and will tell anyone what's

217.739 --> 223.59
going on if they even care about it and

220.28 --> 227.94
I don't know if was recorded but he kind

223.59 --> 230.37
of like in between he started to really

227.94 --> 234.9
like called me a snake in the grass and

230.37 --> 238.049
I'm in the darkness and like dude he was

234.9 --> 243.87
like seriously pissed off or just trying

238.049 --> 246.019
to bluff me that guy I don't know what

243.87 --> 246.019
is

248.66 --> 254.63
yeah I didn't really respond not gonna

251.93 --> 257.63
go in fighting I'm not gonna go like oh

254.63 --> 261.05
you shall not fast I'm not gonna go

257.63 --> 264.59
wizard on him because he's trying to go

261.05 --> 267.77000000000004
all priests on me you know I am my own

264.59 --> 271.94
priest and I'm pretty sure I know what

267.77 --> 276.40999999999997
I'm doing and sometimes I like to get a

271.94 --> 281.18
little on that edge be just a little

276.41 --> 284.57000000000005
little sneaky but only for if yeah I

281.18 --> 290.24
think there's gonna be at least on the

284.57 --> 293.21
short term or good outcome come on

290.24 --> 295.78000000000003
getting sniped it's like almost you

293.21 --> 300.53
could even call it a a flat earth debate

295.78 --> 302.96
baptizing you know so I I don't see why

300.53 --> 309.22999999999996
slick change is overreacting so badly to

302.96 --> 315.59
all this you know yeah slick definitely

309.23 --> 318.79
had an experience John sharp he

315.59 --> 318.78999999999996
experienced our win

334.55 --> 337.06
at

340.03 --> 346.34
the ghost of Mark sergeant

342.759 --> 350.349
that's nice try but I don't think Tim

346.34 --> 350.349
Osman is a flat earther

358.02 --> 361.88
and yeah

364.32 --> 371.62
whoever is relevant in flat earth is up

368.46 --> 374.59
to the people in every situation you

371.62 --> 376.72
know it's it's in flux it all depends on

374.59 --> 381.58
what everyone does what they discover

376.72 --> 386.92
what they build how inspiring that is to

381.58 --> 389.65
others you know I have my moments and I

386.92 --> 393.01
have definitely moments where even

389.65 --> 396.76
though I do try I just don't have a lot

393.01 --> 398.44
of energy and just I feel useless other

396.76 --> 402.28
people still tell me yeah it's very

398.44 --> 404.14
inspiring and it's like okay okay well

402.28 --> 406.92999999999995
yeah at least I'm trying to be honest

404.14 --> 409.69
and everything and open and even when I

406.93 --> 414.61
am like being on the edge of sneaky or

409.69 --> 419.25
wrong I'll admit it now I'm wondering

414.61 --> 422.71000000000004
should I apologize to slake James but I

419.25 --> 428.53
don't know Randy never apologized to me

422.71 --> 431.97999999999996
and we're good buddies you know and I

428.53 --> 436.75
guess it despite all everything it is

431.98 --> 441.1
kind of an ego thing it's just I don't

436.75 --> 446.79
like his principles and he thinks I'm a

441.1 --> 446.79
snake in the grass goody

447.76 --> 460.55
I'll leave it up to everyone else what

455.83 --> 471.77
ranty acts like a woman why do you say

460.55 --> 481.13
that look that's just Randy has his

471.77 --> 484.7
mousse as well so I wouldn't call that a

481.13 --> 492.32
woman in general maybe like he does when

484.7 --> 494.34999999999997
he's more oversensitive or yeah maybe it

492.32 --> 497.87
is kind of like a scorned woman almost

494.35 --> 503.0
but yeah that's just sometimes you know

497.87 --> 509.29
he's usually very very laid back and an

503.0 --> 509.29
open and everything and so it's you guys

518.44 --> 528.44
it's so fine but yeah the thing from a

525.14 --> 532.52
pragmatic standpoint from a show host

528.44 --> 536.0600000000001
standpoint and yeah I do feel like I'm a

532.52 --> 540.68
sporting cast for Nathan I just feel

536.06 --> 543.14
like he is a disrupter he he breaks

540.68 --> 545.93
trains of thought to just like stop

543.14 --> 547.73
drawing all these conclusions and just

545.93 --> 549.7399999999999
experience it and it's completely

547.73 --> 552.26
pointless and that pisses me off

549.74 --> 557.1800000000001
it stops trains of thought but yeah he's

552.26 --> 561.47
not the only one so yeah you guys did

557.18 --> 565.2199999999999
you see a gem on I I didn't even think

561.47 --> 569.899
it was the HTM that's always yeah that's

565.22 --> 572.4200000000001
been how loyal follow a follower for for

569.899 --> 576.68
a long time but apparently was him

572.42 --> 581.5699999999999
totally didn't expect him to sound like

576.68 --> 583.459
that it was yeah that mixed feelings

581.57 --> 587.3900000000001
about it but it was good to see him at

583.459 --> 590.0889999999999
least doing that yeah and it wasn't

587.39 --> 593.06
getting a bit trollish because I don't

590.089 --> 598.6400000000001
know it's just the combination of how he

593.06 --> 606.77
talks and just his voice it's it

598.64 --> 608.99
inspires me in a silly way yeah Steve

606.77 --> 611.5699999999999
yeah me too I didn't even realize it was

608.99 --> 613.64
the AGM that always comes and comes to

611.57 --> 618.82
my show I hope I didn't piss him off I

613.64 --> 618.8199999999999
did kind of poke test him a bit

623.11 --> 630.04
but he certainly seems to be the

625.339 --> 630.0400000000001
character of his own it's interesting

637.089 --> 642.82
but anyway yeah ajm also absolutely has

644.05 --> 649.43
has rumpling capability breaking off

647.63 --> 653.57
conversation and starting off about

649.43 --> 655.76
completely different things we're

653.57 --> 658.13
talking about like eclipses and he

655.76 --> 663.22
started off about all but the bankers at

658.13 --> 666.85
did the jew back early okay

663.22 --> 666.85
that was amazing

666.92 --> 674.5889999999999
everything has a time in the place and I

670.39 --> 674.5889999999999
think he's still struggling a bit

683.93 --> 694.9499999999999
yeah well what's good to see was good

686.4 --> 698.66
and the baits are very interesting yeah

694.95 --> 701.1
and also what did you guys think of my

698.66 --> 708.8399999999999
interview with Kyle the second part

701.1 --> 711.3000000000001
eaten interrupted by others part when

708.84 --> 714.23
went on quite a ride didn't really

711.3 --> 714.2299999999999
expect all of that

720.72 --> 730.11
I think like that he would just go there

727.05 --> 732.87
basically yeah the threat of new regions

730.11 --> 735.3290000000001
very easily I didn't expect that to

732.87 --> 739.92
happen so I think I was caught off guard

735.329 --> 743.189
a little gave me some pause here and

739.92 --> 745.2299999999999
there and yeah I had to improvise

743.189 --> 748.769
basically in my response because it was

745.23 --> 751.379
just like whoa this is huge and now I

748.769 --> 756.18
have to look at all of it from another

751.379 --> 758.519
angle and even trying to size up who was

756.18 --> 761.2199999999999
sitting in front of me who I was having

758.519 --> 764.759
a discussion with was not so

761.22 --> 769.86
straightforward anymore to me so I

764.759 --> 772.23
thought it was very difficult but at

769.86 --> 774.36
least the the gravity part was very

772.23 --> 779.61
obvious again didn't provide that

774.36 --> 782.72
independent variable but yeah all that

779.61 --> 782.72
all the other stuff

786.84 --> 789.979
[Music]

799.71 --> 802.61
all right

805.199 --> 812.2489999999999
yeah that's a nonsensical question

807.829 --> 814.7389999999999
blinding you with science I don't know

812.249 --> 818.999
who you're referring to who is doing all

814.739 --> 821.6990000000001
the density equations but yeah the

818.999 --> 824.309
relative density equation does not have

821.699 --> 829.4699999999999
a G in it doesn't require it it's

824.309 --> 833.149
completely superfluous so that's just a

829.47 --> 833.149
false claim it's a strawman

835.6 --> 839.72
[Music]

869.1 --> 874.97
Wow okay

880.15 --> 885.5799999999999
wait right

885.759 --> 892.3290000000001
the ghost of Mark sergeant are you

887.739 --> 894.489
talking to me I over all don't insult

892.329 --> 907.329
people with mental disorders what I do

894.489 --> 908.529
analyze analyze people so and I do it to

907.329 --> 913.3599999999999
myself as well

908.529 --> 916.559
I'm just openly applying it

913.36 --> 916.559
[Music]

920.54 --> 923.7099999999999
[Music]

930.29 --> 939.069
oh [ __ ] hey alright okay

936.049 --> 939.069
it wasn't addressing me

939.589 --> 955.249
I got devil syndrome hey I was talking

944.959 --> 958.329
about me of course our win always thinks

955.249 --> 972.4100000000001
he insults people with mental disorders

958.329 --> 976.939
makes perfect sense right not I think

972.41 --> 979.069
that when I yes analyze people and

976.939 --> 981.049
declare that I think they have certain

979.069 --> 982.939
mental disorders usually a lot of people

981.049 --> 989.299
tend to agree about that point so

982.939 --> 992.889
shouldn't have to worry about it anyway

989.299 --> 992.889
it's not my conversation

996.11 --> 1003.84
all right okay that the decent question

1001.47 --> 1008.1600000000001
alejandro Sariah

1003.84 --> 1011.26
if gravity were to be true would that

1008.16 --> 1012.61
would disprove Flat Earth or come both

1011.26 --> 1016.87
things coexist

1012.61 --> 1018.4
although depends on what type of gravity

1016.87 --> 1023.5600000000001
you're trying to prove if you're just

1018.4 --> 1026.1399999999999
trying to prove a force that's like the

1023.56 --> 1028.0
first thing of it that would come into

1026.14 --> 1030.13
reach they actually prove there's

1028.0 --> 1032.88
something there that causes all these

1030.13 --> 1035.89
things instead of just an aberration

1032.88 --> 1037.92
well that wouldn't disprove the Flat

1035.89 --> 1037.92
Earth

1038.31 --> 1044.05
now on the other hand if you could

1040.78 --> 1052.48
definitively prove scientifically that

1044.05 --> 1055.96
mass the mass of matter is attracted to

1052.48 --> 1057.91
other mass especially blued the solid

1055.96 --> 1063.25
masses they are attracted to other

1057.91 --> 1066.49
masses directly if you can really prove

1063.25 --> 1069.73
that then yeah things become different

1066.49 --> 1071.83
because then you have the the founders

1069.73 --> 1074.76
you know gravity that could allow all

1071.83 --> 1080.28
these balls in outer space potentially

1074.76 --> 1084.87
deform if you just ignore the whole

1080.28 --> 1087.6299999999999
second law of thermodynamics but yeah

1084.87 --> 1090.85
but good luck with that

1087.63 --> 1093.5800000000002
good luck that because I'm willing to

1090.85 --> 1099.1
entertain in the apparent force this

1093.58 --> 1101.77
equilibrium constant but as a concept

1099.1 --> 1104.1399999999999
because it works out like Kyle

1101.77 --> 1107.05
understands but he does not understand

1104.14 --> 1109.45
however that is that just because it

1107.05 --> 1112.84
works out doesn't mean that it is an

1109.45 --> 1117.07
actual thing a physical thing it's

1112.84 --> 1119.6399999999999
virtual and it fits for some mysterious

1117.07 --> 1119.6399999999999
reason

1130.63 --> 1136.2990000000002
but yeah overall yeah and of course

1133.66 --> 1142.0900000000001
disequilibrium proof would not disprove

1136.299 --> 1145.6299999999999
Flat Earth at all and would simply prove

1142.09 --> 1149.4289999999999
a said yeah a part of the settings of

1145.63 --> 1149.429
this realm what is going on here

1156.71 --> 1166.6390000000001
right Oh alejandro

1161.45 --> 1169.1290000000001
Sariah the newtonian gravity for which

1166.639 --> 1171.86
Newton by the way did not claim a

1169.129 --> 1176.9289999999999
hypothesis by the way let me emphasize

1171.86 --> 1179.889
that yeah but look if that kind of

1176.929 --> 1189.169
gravity was real in any way it would

1179.889 --> 1192.649
things would get weird and I guess

1189.169 --> 1195.1100000000001
technically whatever is going to be

1192.649 --> 1198.9089999999999
supposedly here for whatever reason

1195.11 --> 1202.5089999999998
would then like yeah crumble or shift

1198.909 --> 1207.23
dramatically everything would be weird

1202.509 --> 1210.549
but it's just a ridiculous ridiculous

1207.23 --> 1210.549
notion to even think about that

1218.99 --> 1224.98
no no blinding you with science

1221.98 --> 1228.02
absolutely not

1224.98 --> 1230.26
that's just pure arrogance it's just not

1228.02 --> 1230.26
true

1244.06 --> 1247.21
[Music]

1265.179 --> 1269.009
all right Rambo Jambo interesting

1267.609 --> 1275.619
question

1269.009 --> 1278.83
ancient history related is there

1275.619 --> 1284.9789999999998
anything left of the ancients the

1278.83 --> 1286.899
original ancients I don't think so I

1284.979 --> 1292.3590000000002
don't think there's anything left of

1286.899 --> 1295.6589999999999
them the creatures that yeah that did

1292.359 --> 1298.809
all that except for what was left behind

1295.659 --> 1301.21
and had to integrate into the new

1298.809 --> 1305.259
setting of the world without all the

1301.21 --> 1307.919
technology being present so whatever was

1305.259 --> 1311.379
there has already integrated with

1307.919 --> 1315.279
everything over the yeah with humanity

1311.379 --> 1317.529
and everything that's left now so I

1315.279 --> 1322.2
don't think there's some separate hidden

1317.529 --> 1324.549
island or under ground cave with a

1322.2 --> 1326.71
civilization that's been locked away

1324.549 --> 1329.07
from us for a thousand years nothing

1326.71 --> 1329.07
like that

1329.789 --> 1340.029
although yeah you know at this point who

1334.559 --> 1343.83
maybe maybe there would be but now

1340.029 --> 1343.83
personally I don't think so

1362.29 --> 1369.01
yeah that's another angle to it neroon

1364.48 --> 1371.34
Thorson they are not locked away from us

1369.01 --> 1374.86
we are the ones locked away from them

1371.34 --> 1377.5
yeah I've heard that concept before even

1374.86 --> 1379.36
with the the entire dome theory that

1377.5 --> 1383.49
there would be a dome surrounding our

1379.36 --> 1386.9799999999998
realm and that outside the rest of the

1383.49 --> 1391.63
other civilisations potentially

1386.98 --> 1393.4
non-human alien would be doing their

1391.63 --> 1400.0
thing and we're like the prison yeah

1393.4 --> 1402.5800000000002
I've heard the theory but yeah that

1400.0 --> 1405.42
that's presuming a dome again it's a lot

1402.58 --> 1405.4199999999998
to presume

1413.53 --> 1423.29
but on the other hand look even with the

1418.04 --> 1430.76
rectangular looping bottle if we would

1423.29 --> 1434.75
assume that at the poll areas the the

1430.76 --> 1439.19
width of the loop would be very narrow

1434.75 --> 1442.94
compared to the equator at each of these

1439.19 --> 1446.51
regions then yeah maybe there is some

1442.94 --> 1451.0700000000002
kind of element some kind of effect of

1446.51 --> 1453.86
the realm that would cut off that would

1451.07 --> 1456.8799999999999
basically cut narrow down the loop so

1453.86 --> 1460.01
much that it would just cut off access

1456.88 --> 1462.3200000000002
there would not be it would yeah it

1460.01 --> 1467.24
would be spatially cut off like a portal

1462.32 --> 1470.78
closing maybe that happens you know

1467.24 --> 1475.18
spatial non-linearity it is quite as a

1470.78 --> 1475.18
real phenomena and the possibilities

1476.14 --> 1481.7
possibilities that I can think of her

1478.7 --> 1483.77
potentially endless so who knows what

1481.7 --> 1487.3700000000001
reality is in this regards maybe there

1483.77 --> 1489.8
is a cut-off point and then sometimes it

1487.37 --> 1493.9099999999999
may shift again and open up to the rest

1489.8 --> 1497.9199999999998
of what is beyond for a certain time or

1493.91 --> 1497.92
for a prolonged period I don't know

1502.37 --> 1506.6599999999999
I've heard about that type of

1504.05 --> 1510.07
speculations from many angles and I

1506.66 --> 1516.47
thought that well considering my looping

1510.07 --> 1519.47
concept yeah I have an explanation for

1516.47 --> 1523.72
it that fits my model basically if such

1519.47 --> 1540.68
a thing would occur so yeah who knows

1523.72 --> 1542.42
it's my model anyway yeah you're saying

1540.68 --> 1545.3
the same thing over and over again

1542.42 --> 1548.18
blinding you with science and I already

1545.3 --> 1556.43
addressed it it's [ __ ] it's a straw

1548.18 --> 1561.41
man the relative density equation the

1556.43 --> 1565.19
formula the effect the B the phenomenon

1561.41 --> 1568.97
being proven with science does not

1565.19 --> 1572.8400000000001
contain gravity in it so it's just not

1568.97 --> 1575.99
true it may be all the density equations

1572.84 --> 1580.3999999999999
that you use selectively for what you'd

1575.99 --> 1584.54
like to do contains them but the

1580.4 --> 1588.24
relative density Theory does not so yeah

1584.54 --> 1591.46
you can stop asking now it's a straw man

1588.24 --> 1591.46
[Music]

1594.54 --> 1604.18
yeah Alejandro's sorry yeah it doesn't

1599.32 --> 1607.36
make the move fall down because yeah you

1604.18 --> 1611.47
have no proof that the moon is physical

1607.36 --> 1613.9299999999998
in nature to begin with and I'd say it's

1611.47 --> 1618.55
rather holographic and just apparent

1613.93 --> 1621.91
light phenomena are not going to be

1618.55 --> 1623.4099999999999
falling down to whatever is physically

1621.91 --> 1626.3400000000001
present in the world because they're a

1623.41 --> 1626.3400000000001
parent phenomena

1642.56 --> 1646.72
all right it's time for you to go

1650.97 --> 1653.97
yeah

1658.88 --> 1664.0100000000002
no world peace no it would not

1670.61 --> 1677.1789999999999
in relative density there is no

1673.039 --> 1681.799
directional force there is displacement

1677.179 --> 1685.75
force that happens with all matter it

1681.799 --> 1689.179
displaces - it's well yeah - it's

1685.75 --> 1692.929
equilibrium point within the relative

1689.179 --> 1697.779
density layers the displacement cannon

1692.929 --> 1697.779
can be in more than one direction

1708.62 --> 1713.8899999999999
yeah I said it's a hologram the moon is

1711.35 --> 1719.809
a hologram it's not a physical object

1713.89 --> 1722.21
it's a as a fractal nature there's been

1719.809 --> 1728.029
recorded the ripple of the Sun by crow

1722.21 --> 1730.4
triple 7 years and years ago and it just

1728.029 --> 1733.309
so happens to be exactly the same size

1730.4 --> 1737.8400000000001
as the Sun angular wise doesn't make any

1733.309 --> 1742.85
damn sense and it tends to disappear for

1737.84 --> 1745.4289999999999
what was it three days just completely

1742.85 --> 1752.1689999999999
disappear with no trace that does make

1745.429 --> 1756.0800000000002
any damn sense physically yeah hologram

1752.169 --> 1761.0800000000002
hologram light based optical phenomena

1756.08 --> 1761.08
apparent not actually physically there

1780.71 --> 1790.76
yeah yeah it is apparently there I know

1786.95 --> 1794.24
nothing happening I know you see it what

1790.76 --> 1797.87
you see the seeing part that is there

1794.24 --> 1799.789
correct it's not necessarily physical

1797.87 --> 1804.799
you have no real proof that it is

1799.789 --> 1808.1589999999999
physical that is yeah for you for you to

1804.799 --> 1809.929
test that you can actually use to prove

1808.159 --> 1814.19
that it is physical besides what NASA

1809.929 --> 1819.19
hands you and there are several eats

1814.19 --> 1819.19
that it is not physical in nature at all

1819.279 --> 1825.46
and the same goes for the appearance on

1823.25 --> 1825.46
this

1839.65 --> 1848.23
yeah I don't know about me tears 777 it

1845.86 --> 1887.9099999999999
is much harder to figure out what all of

1848.23 --> 1892.72
that is and that was a 10th man

1887.91 --> 1897.48
apparently they added me but called me

1892.72 --> 1897.48
at the same time all right

1908.14 --> 1915.6200000000001
of melbourne yeah now just a little

1913.58 --> 1923.4099999999999
sniffy not a call or anything that's

1915.62 --> 1927.6699999999998
just this weather yeah

1923.41 --> 1931.43
Alejandro sorry yeah the Sun is a

1927.67 --> 1935.93
hologram as well that's right that disk

1931.43 --> 1940.55
that blinding disk thing is a hologram

1935.93 --> 1943.6100000000001
as well it's not a physical object like

1940.55 --> 1946.79
a lamp radiating all the daylight that

1943.61 --> 1950.8999999999999
hits you and actually warms you it's a

1946.79 --> 1954.44
side effect in my personal opinion an

1950.9 --> 1958.2800000000002
optical side effect of well looking

1954.44 --> 1961.18
towards all the daylight towards the

1958.28 --> 1961.18
epicenter of it

1966.27 --> 1970.27
how do I work that out it's an

1969.28 --> 1973.33
observation

1970.27 --> 1976.21
it's my personal instinctive analysis

1973.33 --> 1978.9099999999999
it's just like I did how I did how I

1976.21 --> 1985.48
observed the optical slant I see it this

1978.91 --> 1993.46
is what I see I describe it and I don't

1985.48 --> 1996.49
have all the answers what makes the

1993.46 --> 1998.53
seasons change is the output of the

1996.49 --> 2006.3
daylight which changes with the seasons

1998.53 --> 2009.42
very periodically pretty abruptly the

2006.3 --> 2011.1
type of daylight shifts in a short time

2009.42 --> 2014.64
span I think three days or something

2011.1 --> 2016.6499999999999
maybe even one day and then the type of

2014.64 --> 2018.74
sunlight changes the same goes for the

2016.65 --> 2021.69
moon the type of moonlight also changes

2018.74 --> 2025.34
moonlight is much stronger and colder

2021.69 --> 2025.3400000000001
during the winter than during the summer

2026.06 --> 2032.25
and during the summer the Sun lights the

2029.19 --> 2036.81
day light output is much stronger more

2032.25 --> 2038.52
intense than during the winter when it's

2036.81 --> 2041.3999999999999
in the winter it's pretty bright but

2038.52 --> 2043.94
it's not cold at all I mean it's not

2041.4 --> 2043.94
warm at all

2050.74 --> 2056.3999999999996
yeah moonlight is cold nothing happening

2053.8 --> 2056.4
it is

2062.52 --> 2065.12
yeah

2071.52 --> 2082.0099999999998
try using a Sun cooker with moonlight

2075.869 --> 2082.01
and you will see it is measurably cold

2086.089 --> 2091.399
and wave dismissals is not gonna work

2088.71 --> 2091.399
with me sorry

2123.31 --> 2133.54
ha and James cannon that is freaking

2129.94 --> 2137.23
hilarious you're wrong it's actually not

2133.54 --> 2140.08
true if you've noticed if you've learned

2137.23 --> 2146.23
your freakin heliocentric [ __ ] model

2140.08 --> 2148.5699999999997
you'll notice that during the summer the

2146.23 --> 2152.02
Sun is exactly the same distance as

2148.57 --> 2157.09
during the winter and during the seasons

2152.02 --> 2160.0
it is different again during the spring

2157.09 --> 2163.81
and the autumn because it is like

2160.0 --> 2165.82
cyclical it's like an oval around the

2163.81 --> 2168.0099999999998
Sun that's supposedly the heliocentric

2165.82 --> 2172.8700000000003
concept so you're dead wrong over there

2168.01 --> 2176.9500000000003
it's not true it's supposedly about how

2172.87 --> 2179.0499999999997
the earth tilt of the rotation is angled

2176.95 --> 2183.04
towards it that is what's supposed to be

2179.05 --> 2184.78
causing more warmth on one side and on

2183.04 --> 2186.73
the not on the other that those

2184.78 --> 2189.27
supposedly how that works are you're

2186.73 --> 2189.27
dead wrong

2193.53 --> 2197.3
learn your own model man

2209.45 --> 2218.43
all right let's continue the other

2211.77 --> 2222.06
conversation Alejandra Surya but if you

2218.43 --> 2223.9199999999996
say that the Sun is an optical optical

2222.06 --> 2225.75
illusion then the race should have

2223.92 --> 2229.2000000000003
nothing to do with the temperature of

2225.75 --> 2231.66
the earth no that's wrong the optical

2229.2 --> 2236.6699999999996
illusion is just a side effect of seeing

2231.66 --> 2240.21
right like lens flare like rainbows all

2236.67 --> 2242.73
these scenes seeing things optics but

2240.21 --> 2246.03
the sunlight the daylight more

2242.73 --> 2248.79
specifically yeah from yeah you know

2246.03 --> 2250.8
where you see the Sun disc from that

2248.79 --> 2255.15
direction comes that daylight was that

2250.8 --> 2258.78
daylight is provably interacting with

2255.15 --> 2261.38
material and yeah causing heat to be

2258.78 --> 2264.86
absorbs and other types of effects that

2261.38 --> 2267.51
daylight is doing that that is actually

2264.86 --> 2270.15
bringing the heat and doing all these

2267.51 --> 2273.63
effects not the Sun it's the daylight

2270.15 --> 2276.09
the Sun is just an apparition that it

2273.63 --> 2280.26
happens to be visible at the epicenter

2276.09 --> 2283.23
from which the daylight comes in

2280.26 --> 2288.17
relation to your to the observers

2283.23 --> 2288.17
position on the earth specifically yeah

2304.24 --> 2312.6899999999996
I'd be happy to do a lie detector test

2306.82 --> 2319.4100000000003
James cannon because I see no reason why

2312.69 --> 2322.3
yeah why it would be lying about this I

2319.41 --> 2326.74
would be holding back I'm figuring it

2322.3 --> 2328.9300000000003
out and I've got a lot of these ideas

2326.74 --> 2330.75
and I've been expanding upon them and

2328.93 --> 2333.16
I've been building for a long time just

2330.75 --> 2335.53
comparing everything see what people

2333.16 --> 2338.08
bring what type of questions they can

2335.53 --> 2339.7000000000003
ask how well they can even conceptualize

2338.08 --> 2341.29
what I'm talking about because that

2339.7 --> 2344.3799999999997
seems to be the most difficult part

2341.29 --> 2348.27
about it does even understanding what

2344.38 --> 2352.57
I'm describing how a different

2348.27 --> 2355.3
visualization of how things work it's

2352.57 --> 2359.8900000000003
very difficult for many many people not

2355.3 --> 2361.8700000000003
just ballers everyone the ballers of a

2359.89 --> 2363.1299999999997
particularly tough time with it because

2361.87 --> 2366.25
their mind is so set

2363.13 --> 2370.11
so filled in with knowledge of that

2366.25 --> 2370.11
model that they believe in so much

2375.34 --> 2380.13
my Quran buddy

2377.32 --> 2380.13
that's good one

2381.17 --> 2384.4
[Music]

2389.39 --> 2393.0499999999997
[Music]

2393.92 --> 2396.7000000000003
hmm

2407.319 --> 2410.829
you guys are hilarious

2415.92 --> 2425.19
all right yes Alejandra Surya the

2419.849 --> 2428.309
daylight comes from that direction where

2425.19 --> 2430.71
you see the appearance of discs that's

2428.309 --> 2435.049
where it's coming from that's how the

2430.71 --> 2438.48
beams apparently entered this world and

2435.049 --> 2440.849
I can't fully explain it out of theories

2438.48 --> 2442.829
about it but they are speculative and

2440.849 --> 2447.6600000000003
they're gonna be very difficult to prove

2442.829 --> 2450.779
I am currently presuming it's like my

2447.66 --> 2452.94
most fruitful ground to pursue right now

2450.779 --> 2456.869
I'm presuming that it has to do

2452.94 --> 2459.7200000000003
something with high tension elec

2456.869 --> 2463.619
electricity or atmospheric electricity

2459.72 --> 2465.8999999999996
up there causing some kind critical mass

2463.619 --> 2467.76
so maybe some kind of induction effect

2465.9 --> 2473.25
somehow I don't know with what is up

2467.76 --> 2476.2200000000003
there that causes light effects in a

2473.25 --> 2480.299
specific fractal line pattern that we

2476.22 --> 2482.6699999999996
know as the globe of the heavens it's

2480.299 --> 2485.46
kind of science fictiony sounding I know

2482.67 --> 2488.789
but it's the best I can think up at the

2485.46 --> 2491.539
moment and it might look if that is

2488.789 --> 2497.1600000000003
correct and it might be somehow

2491.539 --> 2501.2690000000002
miniature miniaturized emulated it could

2497.16 --> 2505.5
be you could have like a mini cam and a

2501.269 --> 2508.319
device some kind of container causing

2505.5 --> 2510.96
the same type of tensions on the right

2508.319 --> 2512.73
level and then for the mini camera at

2510.96 --> 2514.7690000000002
the bottom if it would look around it

2512.73 --> 2518.339
would literally see all the star heavens

2514.769 --> 2521.069
and maybe that is possible somehow and

2518.339 --> 2523.019
then as you look from the outside into

2521.069 --> 2525.93
it you basically don't see all those

2523.019 --> 2527.97
stars it's only when you look from the

2525.93 --> 2530.549
inside and a specific coordinate that

2527.97 --> 2533.9399999999996
you would see all that maybe that could

2530.549 --> 2535.589
be done one day it's yeah extremely

2533.94 --> 2539.339
ambitious and you have to know about

2535.589 --> 2540.779
holographics very well and I don't so

2539.339 --> 2543.0499999999997
it's kind of science fictiony at this

2540.779 --> 2546.46
point but yeah

2543.05 --> 2546.46
it is what it is

2549.98 --> 2554.15
[Music]

2552.91 --> 2557.199
all right

2554.15 --> 2557.199
[Music]

2568.43 --> 2571.1189999999997
all right

2571.17 --> 2576.53
well yeah those two points are kind of

2575.13 --> 2580.4700000000003
difficult

2576.53 --> 2583.32
Alejandro sorry yeah because gravity is

2580.47 --> 2586.5299999999997
an aberration after all and it is so

2583.32 --> 2589.3500000000004
suggestive that it exists somehow and

2586.53 --> 2591.7200000000003
that's just very tough to grasp as

2589.35 --> 2593.88
you're trying to learn the landscape and

2591.72 --> 2596.0699999999997
just constantly bump into the damn

2593.88 --> 2597.09
gravity aberration all the time so I

2596.07 --> 2602.1600000000003
totally get that

2597.09 --> 2605.21
as for the seasons right it's not that

2602.16 --> 2609.42
difficult to explain if you understand

2605.21 --> 2613.23
well the weird seasonal nature of the of

2609.42 --> 2617.58
the sunlight cycles but yeah if you

2613.23 --> 2621.66
wanna then know why why does the Sun why

2617.58 --> 2624.2999999999997
does the moon why yeah I don't know I I

2621.66 --> 2627.54
just gave a science fictiony idea as to

2624.3 --> 2630.84
why I don't know it's very tough on but

2627.54 --> 2633.63
that's what seems to be driving the

2630.84 --> 2639.03
seasonal cycles mostly that's like

2633.63 --> 2641.04
directly interlinking measurably

2639.03 --> 2645.6200000000003
interlinking temperature measurably

2641.04 --> 2649.55
weather condition change measurably yeah

2645.62 --> 2649.5499999999997
so yeah that's it

2651.22 --> 2657.3689999999997
no I haven't a best God with a drama

2655.42 --> 2660.4900000000002
about gravity all the time

2657.369 --> 2664.5
look I know exactly what gravity is and

2660.49 --> 2669.31
what it is not and there will always be

2664.5 --> 2673.329
gravity to talk about even when all the

2669.31 --> 2675.339
ballers are all no more gravity or it's

2673.329 --> 2677.9500000000003
all set I will still be able to talk

2675.339 --> 2682.7999999999997
about gravity because it is still an

2677.95 --> 2687.0099999999998
aberration there's still things that are

2682.8 --> 2689.4700000000003
tough to explain with just relative

2687.01 --> 2693.5200000000004
density because it's a closed off system

2689.47 --> 2695.5
just to prove what it does and yeah it

2693.52 --> 2698.47
doesn't give any account - yeah the

2695.5 --> 2701.43
density buoyancy alignment shift when

2698.47 --> 2704.8289999999997
other forces of when forces apply all

2701.43 --> 2709.3289999999997
all the separate effects all these

2704.829 --> 2711.55
phenomena explain that at all and if you

2709.329 --> 2713.17
presuppose gravity then that could

2711.55 --> 2715.6600000000003
technically explain part of the

2713.17 --> 2718.7200000000003
aberration that's part what it does but

2715.66 --> 2721.81
yeah I'm still curious as to why it is

2718.72 --> 2724.3489999999997
set up like this there's more to be

2721.81 --> 2724.349
discovered

2726.28 --> 2731.07
Oh Jason

2732.91 --> 2736.1499999999996
go away

2739.66 --> 2744.69
hey hello goodtimz for all good to see

2742.54 --> 2744.69
you

2746.58 --> 2753.88
Greg Clary almost not just the

2750.82 --> 2756.13
observation it is that would be easy you

2753.88 --> 2757.54
know that if you could just observe it

2756.13 --> 2760.21
then you wouldn't have to say bird

2757.54 --> 2765.82
landing but now it's rather it's a

2760.21 --> 2769.2400000000002
deduction based concept it works very

2765.82 --> 2773.05
smoothly when you're building formulas

2769.24 --> 2777.85
and direct interacting relations within

2773.05 --> 2780.21
physics but it's a deduction based

2777.85 --> 2780.21
concept

2785.71 --> 2793.339
right oh yeah by the way talking about

2788.9 --> 2796.789
writing a fantasy book I found my age of

2793.339 --> 2800.119
paradox writing back I save stored it on

2796.789 --> 2802.94
a special USB B stick so I found it back

2800.119 --> 2804.8900000000003
pretty pretty excited that I didn't lose

2802.94 --> 2808.099
it forever very happy about that

2804.89 --> 2813.3689999999997
so yeah I do have my science fiction

2808.099 --> 2813.369
story back about time-travel chaos

2816.17 --> 2819.369
[Music]

2834.07 --> 2843.3300000000004
right world peace yes speed of cars also

2839.17 --> 2846.37
a deduction based concept but with very

2843.33 --> 2850.44
direct physical consequences so it is

2846.37 --> 2850.44
more like an empirical deduction a

2850.86 --> 2856.0
gravity not so much it is purely

2853.96 --> 2858.34
conceptual deduction because you can

2856.0 --> 2861.91
have you there's no real actual

2858.34 --> 2865.54
observation of the force effect you can

2861.91 --> 2869.58
only deduce it so it's conceptual with a

2865.54 --> 2872.59
speeding car and the study philosophy is

2869.58 --> 2877.09
empirical because you can see it travel

2872.59 --> 2880.03
you can deduce its speed all that but

2877.09 --> 2883.6000000000004
also it has certain effects the speeding

2880.03 --> 2886.9900000000002
car if you put trashcan on the road it's

2883.6 --> 2891.7799999999997
gonna crash it's gonna yeah crush the

2886.99 --> 2895.2999999999997
trashcan and punch it aside impact so

2891.78 --> 2897.3100000000004
empirical data proving velocity and the

2895.3 --> 2900.1000000000004
relating effects of the velocity of that

2897.31 --> 2904.68
car so it's an empirical deduction in

2900.1 --> 2904.68
that case gravity not so much

2909.51 --> 2916.11
yeah yeah that's really nice

2918.31 --> 2925.95
but just seeing things falling doesn't

2920.74 --> 2931.54
prove that there is a unified force

2925.95 --> 2936.81
happening caused by a field of some kind

2931.54 --> 2940.72
a radiation of matter or anything or

2936.81 --> 2944.41
space-time fluctuation no it doesn't

2940.72 --> 2948.6
prove that it just noticed the

2944.41 --> 2953.44
displacement and yeah relative density

2948.6 --> 2958.06
proves what causes the displacement its

2953.44 --> 2961.57
relative density changed it there yeah

2958.06 --> 2964.87
the density and it will dis start to

2961.57 --> 2968.0800000000004
this place and find its equilibrium but

2964.87 --> 2971.13
in its relative density spectrum in the

2968.08 --> 2971.13
in all things

2978.01 --> 2983.92
yeah it doesn't know it doesn't care

2981.79 --> 2987.34
about what is up and down it only cares

2983.92 --> 2990.91
about its relative density equilibrium

2987.34 --> 2993.609
point whatever direction that point is

2990.91 --> 2997.1189999999997
going to be and by the way that point

2993.609 --> 2999.94
usually is pretty predictable preset but

2997.119 --> 3001.77
that is just yeah and analytics in

2999.94 --> 3005.9700000000003
retrospective you can say yeah it's up

3001.77 --> 3008.7599999999998
and down but yeah for the relative

3005.97 --> 3012.48
density concept that is irrelevant it

3008.76 --> 3014.73
just finds its relative density points

3012.48 --> 3016.98
and that point in relation to other

3014.73 --> 3019.29
things will always be the same so

3016.98 --> 3023.91
wherever you put it it is going to try

3019.29 --> 3026.99
to find that point that level and that's

3023.91 --> 3026.99
what makes it relative

3035.109 --> 3038.109
Hey

3045.13 --> 3054.38
the relative density force the force

3050.53 --> 3056.84
which causes displacement in mass when

3054.38 --> 3065.63
it's not at its relative density

3056.84 --> 3068.1800000000003
equilibrium point that force the force

3065.63 --> 3073.03
that is provably there and the cause of

3068.18 --> 3073.0299999999997
it can be proven by experimentation

3087.849 --> 3090.849
displacement

3093.22 --> 3099.1299999999997
it works exactly the same in a vacuum

3095.71 --> 3101.53
why do you people always keep asking the

3099.13 --> 3105.01
same damn question it's the same people

3101.53 --> 3107.26
and sometimes new people always asking

3105.01 --> 3109.2400000000002
the same damn questions and I answer it

3107.26 --> 3114.76
every time and you keep on asking the

3109.24 --> 3117.0989999999997
same [ __ ] damn questions stop it why

3114.76 --> 3118.96
don't you just listen to my answer if

3117.099 --> 3121.119
you can't get it through your head then

3118.96 --> 3123.55
just listen over it yeah you can play

3121.119 --> 3126.6400000000003
back the Flat Earth the early bird show

3123.55 --> 3129.849
where I tell you then you can just play

3126.64 --> 3133.15
it back and listen to it 20 times if

3129.849 --> 3134.44
necessary and then stop asking that same

3133.15 --> 3140.17
damn question

3134.44 --> 3143.339
it's super annoying I'm not here to

3140.17 --> 3143.339
listen to record players

3155.45 --> 3158.91
[Music]

3157.549 --> 3161.849
yeah

3158.91 --> 3164.2799999999997
if you think I am wrong is not a good

3161.849 --> 3166.26
reason to keep on asking the same damn

3164.28 --> 3168.78
question over and over again knowing

3166.26 --> 3171.63
that I will consistently give the same

3168.78 --> 3175.5890000000004
answer and if I make a mistake when I do

3171.63 --> 3178.319
I will correct it so it is the same

3175.589 --> 3180.69
answer there is no reason to keep on

3178.319 --> 3182.3089999999997
asking the same damn question over and

3180.69 --> 3184.4900000000002
over again when you know what I'm gonna

3182.309 --> 3188.52
answer

3184.49 --> 3191.7599999999998
it's trolling it's really annoying and

3188.52 --> 3200.88
it makes you look really neurotic and

3191.76 --> 3203.6090000000004
dumb yeah yeah Peter Van Leeuwen

3200.88 --> 3206.809
it's called relative density talking

3203.609 --> 3206.8089999999997
about for two years at least

3240.24 --> 3245.9799999999996
but no dysfunctional relative density

3243.55 --> 3249.55
does not have to do just with water it

3245.98 --> 3254.47
has to do with all matter anything that

3249.55 --> 3257.86
has a mass has a density a relative

3254.47 --> 3261.1899999999996
density in relation to all other masses

3257.86 --> 3266.28
and it will seek its equilibrium when it

3261.19 --> 3270.69
has maneuvering room to do so solids

3266.28 --> 3270.69
liquids and gases all of it

3304.069 --> 3315.589
well jtt gaming popular conspiracies

3312.749 --> 3321.6899999999996
that I think are naughty

3315.589 --> 3324.72
there are so many out there where yeah

3321.69 --> 3328.289
there's some intentionally goofy [ __ ]

3324.72 --> 3330.8089999999997
going out going on out there and there's

3328.289 --> 3336.029
some super over-generalized

3330.809 --> 3340.9500000000003
yell noisy stories about conspiracy out

3336.029 --> 3344.21
there and there is a vast amount of

3340.95 --> 3348.4199999999996
really detailed well-thought-out

3344.21 --> 3350.45
concepts and research out there as well

3348.42 --> 3350.4500000000003
so

3360.9 --> 3366.059
yeah two people can be talking about the

3363.48 --> 3368.999
same type of conspiracy two groups and

3366.059 --> 3370.8590000000004
one group would make it be very open and

3368.999 --> 3375.299
honest and researching about it and very

3370.859 --> 3378.15
historical everything and the other one

3375.299 --> 3383.22
would just be there to make a goofy

3378.15 --> 3386.46
story and to be the most clicked-on or

3383.22 --> 3390.93
whatever or fulfilling some kind of

3386.46 --> 3393.119
agenda mind control agenda to make the

3390.93 --> 3398.3999999999996
entire thing look stupid and jab at

3393.119 --> 3401.099
other conspiracies to to program in a

3398.4 --> 3406.89
defense mechanism into those that trust

3401.099 --> 3409.4
that line of programming so yeah it's

3406.89 --> 3414.8689999999997
not the conspiracy it is usually the one

3409.4 --> 3416.94
putting it out there that makes

3414.869 --> 3419.21
something incredibly questionable or

3416.94 --> 3419.21
naughty

3425.48 --> 3429.77
but yeah you can try to test me on this

3427.7 --> 3432.41
whatever I would think would be too out

3429.77 --> 3435.25
there I'll give a level judgment it's

3432.41 --> 3438.859
kinda the same thing as you would judge

3435.25 --> 3442.01
things happening in TV series or movies

3438.859 --> 3447.3489999999997
like how far out there is it or is it

3442.01 --> 3451.13
kind of cliche or what's going on or was

3447.349 --> 3455.78
it really well acted very heartful done

3451.13 --> 3461.6800000000003
or was it noisy and pushy or was it

3455.78 --> 3461.6800000000003
rushed yes anyway

3472.89 --> 3478.43
right yeah jtt gaming I do believe in

3476.249 --> 3480.93
crisis actors and situations like

3478.43 --> 3484.3089999999997
supposed mass shooters that get a lot of

3480.93 --> 3489.8999999999996
attention but I don't believe that all

3484.309 --> 3492.96
events are like that but heavy leads

3489.9 --> 3496.6800000000003
that for example there was a Las Vegas

3492.96 --> 3497.339
shooting thing supposedly with bullet

3496.68 --> 3499.3489999999997
sound

3497.339 --> 3501.359
yeah shooting sounds echoing from the

3499.349 --> 3503.63
walls and everything there clear

3501.359 --> 3509.279
indications that was a 0 victim

3503.63 --> 3511.4100000000003
situation for example but yeah with

3509.279 --> 3514.549
others it's a different type of setup

3511.41 --> 3519.6189999999997
and people do get hurt it's just that

3514.549 --> 3521.91
the ones doing it may be false flagging

3519.619 --> 3525.96
trying to pretend to be something else

3521.91 --> 3528.18
so yeah it's all over the place it's a

3525.96 --> 3531.15
giant puzzle and for you to figure it

3528.18 --> 3533.249
out what is real what is not and you

3531.15 --> 3535.98
can't just over generalize it all one

3533.249 --> 3539.249
way or the other because there is gonna

3535.98 --> 3541.739
be total lies and X and just a story and

3539.249 --> 3545.069
hype and there's also going to be pretty

3541.739 --> 3550.65
vile [ __ ] happening out there as well

3545.069 --> 3552.93
and that's just gonna baffle us and make

3550.65 --> 3556.14
us wonder like is that real that just so

3552.93 --> 3559.489
out of place even though it may have

3556.14 --> 3559.489
actually been real

3566.07 --> 3574.1200000000003
he keep on asking jtt gamer

3570.39 --> 3577.21
yeah Alex Jones I'm kind of pissed off

3574.12 --> 3581.62
at him right now because he was

3577.21 --> 3586.41
literally calling to invade Venezuela

3581.62 --> 3589.75
and Maduro yeah it's just so wrong so

3690.2 --> 3695.0299999999997
lot of questions but you ask good

3691.88 --> 3697.2200000000003
questions and you're obviously not

3695.03 --> 3699.53
asking these questions to specifically

3697.22 --> 3700.3399999999997
troll me so that's perfectly fine don't

3699.53 --> 3704.36

3700.34 --> 3707.51
and yeah welcome to the show I hope yeah

3704.36 --> 3711.31
my answers make some kind of sense to

3707.51 --> 3719.36
you or inspired you to look a little bit

3711.31 --> 3722.17
deeper into it but yeah thanks for for

3719.36 --> 3722.17
stopping by yet

3726.16 --> 3729.33
[Music]

3743.099 --> 3751.319
yeah and glacier are you got crows these

3747.69 --> 3753.299
are not grouses or Magpies and it's it's

3751.319 --> 3757.469
the usual family there's like ace a

3753.299 --> 3761.4
flock of them in this region and they

3757.469 --> 3764.099
yeah I've raised them probably two

3761.4 --> 3768.239
generations now so they know there is

3764.099 --> 3770.489
bread on this on this roof every now and

3768.239 --> 3772.309
then and they know I don't like seagulls

3770.489 --> 3776.91
and they're not scared of me anymore

3772.309 --> 3778.469
it's gone so far as to just even like

3776.91 --> 3780.499
have a smoke on the roof and they're not

3778.469 --> 3783.779
gonna fly away it's pretty amazing

3780.499 --> 3786.8689999999997
it just took me four years to do that

3783.779 --> 3792.869
and they yeah they have no problem with

3786.869 --> 3799.739
me now Steve Magpies are not evil

3792.869 --> 3806.009
they're just that just Magpies they're

3799.739 --> 3811.38
very snappy and fooling around in pokey

3806.009 --> 3813.359
and and they're real characters they're

3811.38 --> 3821.009
like real family characters it's

3813.359 --> 3825.14
hilarious they kill birds really well I

3821.009 --> 3828.63
know I know they do sometimes ant eggs

3825.14 --> 3831.959
they are a key ters as well if you keep

3828.63 --> 3833.969
them very well-fed then they'll just be

3831.959 --> 3836.43
frolicking around a lot and they don't

3833.969 --> 3841.199
actually hunt eggs as much it's kind of

3836.43 --> 3845.19
a reason why I do feed them so they

3841.199 --> 3850.7690000000002
don't start yeah hunting the smaller

3845.19 --> 3853.259
birds their eggs so they leave them

3850.769 --> 3857.519
alone so they can flourish under the

3853.259 --> 3859.979
underneath that all that yeah it seems

3857.519 --> 3863.609
to work I've been a lot of small birds

3859.979 --> 3867.359
out there already oh and the big the big

3863.609 --> 3871.949
the big blossom tree here right in front

3867.359 --> 3875.369

3871.949 --> 3876.75
