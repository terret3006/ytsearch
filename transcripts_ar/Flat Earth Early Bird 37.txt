1.37 --> 9.66
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

5.609 --> 14.309
early-bird number 37 and your host

9.66 --> 18.9
Arwen and it's a cold cold day here in

14.309 --> 23.67
the Netherlands yeah wouldn't know

18.9 --> 26.34
there's no or barely any ice but the

23.67 --> 30.42
wind is constantly blowing and it's like

26.34 --> 39.39
cold blades on your skin terrible cold

30.42 --> 42.239000000000004
yeah but thankful enough inside have

39.39 --> 43.35
heating so yeah but it's really cold

42.239 --> 48.39
outside

43.35 --> 62.21
so if you want to chat stop traffic of

48.39 --> 62.21
my rest i hat then winfield so

67.35 --> 75.74
can I talk about today my I don't know

85.68 --> 95.16000000000001
that's funny all the character studying

89.85 --> 99.47999999999999
that I'm doing and noticing that yeah

95.16 --> 103.74
I'm trying to perform on a daily basis

99.48 --> 110.49000000000001
and I'm doing the best I can but yeah I

103.74 --> 113.46
am noticing repeating patterns and

110.49 --> 124.32
basically getting annoyed by my own lack

113.46 --> 127.83
of flexibility or dynamic reach in how I

124.32 --> 131.97
talk I find myself monotonous very

127.83 --> 135.2
annoying but Sony because I come yeah

131.97 --> 137.64
because I now have to talk every day and

135.2 --> 140.64
makes a little difficult unless of

137.64 --> 145.35
course there's like really interesting

140.64 --> 148.04999999999998
subjects at hand right away and when

145.35 --> 149.7
flat earth concerns it pretty much seems

148.05 --> 155.39000000000001
to be the same although yeah there was

149.7 --> 155.39
of course in there yesterday but the

155.9 --> 164.16
nice necessary angular size changes of

161.01 --> 169.44
the planets and that's yeah though that

164.16 --> 172.17
only came out of nowhere to me it's very

169.44 --> 177.209
good point but yeah it's not something

172.17 --> 181.23
that I can really just do myself it's

177.209 --> 184.29
not like oh yeah let me get my telescope

181.23 --> 187.89
or whatever and no I don't have that

184.29 --> 190.41
equipment so I'd have to go get that

187.89 --> 193.5
kind of data through others and it's

190.41 --> 196.89
just gonna be waiting mostly so it is

193.5 --> 199.32
really cool but yeah not something that

196.89 --> 204.44
I can personally delve in a lot right

199.32 --> 207.32999999999998
away so something nice to look out to

204.44 --> 215.19
seeing that that information will

207.33 --> 217.68
eventually be yeah reveals to us hello

215.19 --> 219.95
clearly flat earth joseph saunders flat

217.68 --> 219.95000000000002
ball

223.28 --> 231.959
Wow okay clearly flutter says do you

229.2 --> 236.39
want to see a laser obtained 3d model of

231.959 --> 240.53
the entire country of Egypt sure why not

236.39 --> 240.52999999999997
morning axe them exposed

249.629 --> 255.26
yeah yes even what a correct

258.75 --> 265.599
that's because the Sun is not a tangible

261.639 --> 267.0
object so yeah perspective doesn't apply

265.599 --> 271.53
to it

267.0 --> 275.949
not in the physical sense not in a

271.53 --> 278.10999999999996
geometrical sense you know optical

275.949 --> 281.889
effects will apply to it though so it

278.11 --> 286.18
will be it subject to refraction and it

281.889 --> 290.949
will be subject to Reilly's criteria to

286.18 --> 292.389
diffraction slanty mirages own will be

290.949 --> 295.68
subject to that because it's still

292.389 --> 301.389
optical it's the lights being observed

295.68 --> 303.52
no matter the nature of it so yeah yeah

301.389 --> 304.87
that's my point it's up one of the

303.52 --> 309.099
points that I've been making to

304.87 --> 312.009
basically try to dispel the physical

309.099 --> 318.099
literalism about the disc Flat Earth

312.009 --> 320.409
model and there's more issues to it

318.099 --> 323.199
anyway but yeah

320.409 --> 329.219
hey if if you just let go of the

323.199 --> 333.009
presumption that they are physical then

329.219 --> 338.949
yeah it clears up a lot as to what's

333.009 --> 341.71000000000004
what you're actually seeing you know

338.949 --> 346.12
it's it's just like it's just it's just

341.71 --> 353.31
a miraculous light phenomena all of it

346.12 --> 356.86
the integral of the heavens right and

353.31 --> 361.15
technically because we can't touch them

356.86 --> 363.37
because we have no reliable proof that

361.15 --> 366.56899999999996
they are physical at anyway at our

363.37 --> 373.38
disposal then technically it does become

366.569 --> 373.38
intangible that's true

374.25 --> 382.29
oh yeah how do I know it's just like

378.66 --> 386.85
well because light is the only thing

382.29 --> 391.17
about it that we can actually deduce and

386.85 --> 395.03000000000003
measure and observe and light is the

391.17 --> 397.68
thing that we're measuring so yeah as

395.03 --> 400.44
long as that is the only thing that

397.68 --> 404.13
we're actually measuring and determining

400.44 --> 406.8
is there then that is all it is

404.13 --> 408.96
until further notice until we actually

406.8 --> 413.72
can prove some kind of physicality or

408.96 --> 419.0
whatever almost would be interesting so

413.72 --> 422.64000000000004
right no no not heat and not radiation

419.0 --> 427.76
now it's all part of the spectrum of

422.64 --> 433.97999999999996
light and the actual heat is not caused

427.76 --> 437.34
is caused by light hitting matter that

433.98 --> 443.22
is what causes the heat there's no

437.34 --> 449.09
direct heat coming from a sub there's no

443.22 --> 452.46000000000004
radiation heat it's only he is really

449.09 --> 457.38
becomes tangible as soon as that light

452.46 --> 460.77
the day light hits matter and then the

457.38 --> 465.479
heat the the light of the infrared

460.77 --> 468.95
spectrum part is absorbed by the matter

465.479 --> 472.11
and causes them to vibrate causing heat

468.95 --> 476.15999999999997
that's that's where the heat comes in

472.11 --> 478.79
the Sun itself has no heat it's light

476.16 --> 481.65000000000003
it's it's just an optical phenomenon

478.79 --> 486.21000000000004
it's the day light that actually causes

481.65 --> 489.04999999999995
the heat and causes all the effects that

486.21 --> 489.04999999999995
we know on earth

491.879 --> 497.509
all right them Expos asks what is

494.279 --> 501.589
gravity or net we asked what gravity

497.509 --> 501.589
right aberration

516.47 --> 518.86
yeah

529.94 --> 537.4100000000001
oh really yeah I what's going on

535.01 --> 541.31
I missed glow Buster's I only get this

537.41 --> 545.5699999999999
re-streamed' thing maybe they they

541.31 --> 547.54
changed where they go live again because

545.57 --> 553.13
they used to go live on that second

547.54 --> 556.48
thing I missed it kind of disappointing

553.13 --> 556.48
I kind of wanted to see it

573.39 --> 582.029
oh right damn it I my bailed

578.519 --> 585.45
notification was notified with a regular

582.029 --> 587.67
glow Buster's channel but it was with

585.45 --> 591.24
glow Buster's - that makes no sense

587.67 --> 594.2299999999999
right okay that's why I missed it maybe

591.24 --> 594.23
I'll check it out a little later

612.69 --> 615.98
so let's see

640.29 --> 652.81
guys don't look Steven wedeck is trying

645.31 --> 655.5999999999999
to troll us - don't let him you know is

652.81 --> 658.779
at least being a smart ro and he's

655.6 --> 663.57
asking the good questions the questions

658.779 --> 667.75
that the relative density theory

663.57 --> 671.1700000000001
hypothesis provable hypothesis does not

667.75 --> 673.93
touch upon and yeah that's what I keep

671.17 --> 677.079
telling Riley every time yeah it's very

673.93 --> 680.3499999999999
nice you have a functional theory that

677.079 --> 683.76
you can prove and it works but there's a

680.35 --> 689.23
lot of things that it just avoids

683.76 --> 692.38
technically to prevents it from becoming

689.23 --> 697.779
a complex hypothesis and that was a

692.38 --> 700.8389999999999
smart choice technical choice and so

697.779 --> 704.709
yeah no criticism they did it right the

700.839 --> 709.9300000000001
relative density Theory works but there

704.709 --> 713.41
are elements that simply it has no

709.93 --> 717.42
explanation or so claimed relevance -

713.41 --> 722.11
although yeah the intuition and just our

717.42 --> 725.62
mind or some of us me too

722.11 --> 726.79
tells us yeah that's there's other

725.62 --> 728.889
things to it there's other things

726.79 --> 733.779
happens there is a gradient there is an

728.889 --> 737.41
alignment and those are factors that are

733.779 --> 742.4399999999999
just noticeably out there and it doesn't

737.41 --> 745.569
address that and that is a fact

742.44 --> 748.5690000000001
non address oh yeah

745.569 --> 750.8499999999999
the theory is safe it works doesn't

748.569 --> 752.319
address that and that's still out there

750.85 --> 760.26
in our faces

752.319 --> 763.12
so yeah gravity does become very

760.26 --> 765.22
suggestive suggestive to be there

763.12 --> 768.85
because of these elements that's why I

765.22 --> 773.5
went on the weenie in gravity band

768.85 --> 776.14
before but yeah because of the non

773.5 --> 780.16
we'll factor and no outlook of being

776.14 --> 783.97
able to vary it anytime soon or ever

780.16 --> 787.0
I consider it an aberration because you

783.97 --> 790.45
can't prove it but all these phenomena

787.0 --> 793.63
are highly suggestive that if there is a

790.45 --> 796.33
force this equilibrium at play at all

793.63 --> 800.83
times and it would explain a lot of

796.33 --> 803.23
things but yeah you can prove so that's

800.83 --> 808.47
that's honestly that's technical

803.23 --> 808.47
correctness and that's where I stand

826.67 --> 835.9799999999999
yeah and hey this is not an uncommon

830.339 --> 839.9100000000001
issue why do you think that the Flat

835.98 --> 843.8100000000001
Earth Society decided to make up their

839.91 --> 846.56
own fictional story as how this very

843.81 --> 849.54
obviously a parent

846.56 --> 850.8599999999999
yeah the aberration of gravity is

849.54 --> 853.64
supposed to manifest through the

850.86 --> 857.76
constant acceleration of words in this

853.64 --> 859.649
space whatever which is obviously a

857.76 --> 863.7
science fiction explanation the earth is

859.649 --> 867.24
stationary there is no sign yet no sign

863.7 --> 869.22
of relative movement in a medium so yeah

867.24 --> 872.4300000000001
that's ridiculous there's no proof of

869.22 --> 874.35
that even though it could technically

872.43 --> 877.31
work in a simulation that doesn't prove

874.35 --> 881.58
it again that's model based reasoning

877.31 --> 883.3199999999999
but yeah they at least understand that

881.58 --> 888.9590000000001
there's something there and they try to

883.32 --> 890.94
answer it again using scientism the

888.959 --> 893.79
scientism approach so it's not proof

890.94 --> 895.98
again but it they do it because

893.79 --> 898.86
something's there and yeah to just

895.98 --> 902.73
ignore it that's not satisfactory to

898.86 --> 906.35
anyone not really only to those who are

902.73 --> 910.85
more focused on trying to make a point

906.35 --> 916.86
I'm basically from politicization and

910.85 --> 921.2
yeah that is understandable considering

916.86 --> 923.97
the circumstances but yeah its

921.2 --> 927.4200000000001
effectiveness will run out eventually

923.97 --> 932.12
because you need to move on there's more

927.42 --> 936.3
to figure out it's more than just the

932.12 --> 939.54
those few wins basically in my opinion

936.3 --> 944.399
but yeah we'll see where it goes all

939.54 --> 947.75
depends on what else we learn all right

944.399 --> 947.75
yeah I didn't link anything out

950.339 --> 961.12
I put the link out sorry about that

958.92 --> 964.4599999999999
if you forgot

961.12 --> 964.46
[Music]

988.29 --> 994.699
right so I put the link out in the Flat

990.899 --> 994.699
Earth theory bird scribe Chet

997.069 --> 1002.7489999999999
hi I already is in there are you yeah

1002.119 --> 1006.4100000000001
doing good

1002.749 --> 1010.839
how are you doing I'm doing great

1006.41 --> 1013.429
gonna meet some friends this evening who

1010.839 --> 1018.519
haven't seen like for half a year so

1013.429 --> 1023.059
it's kind of happy to see them again um

1018.519 --> 1029.029
well I I heard you talk about gravity

1023.059 --> 1031.25
for like five minutes or so I have to

1029.029 --> 1034.279
say that with the density and buoyancy

1031.25 --> 1037.789
thing or relative density thing I still

1034.279 --> 1041.839
have questions people can't answer me I

1037.789 --> 1045.019
know I addressed that yeah so so yeah

1041.839 --> 1046.8799999999999
but for example you have a closed

1045.019 --> 1051.789
container right this is filled with

1046.88 --> 1055.19
water and then of course the container

1051.789 --> 1058.73
the whole container has a higher density

1055.19 --> 1061.19
than air around it right because it is a

1058.73 --> 1063.769
complainer but inside the container

1061.19 --> 1067.0
because the containers filled with water

1063.769 --> 1070.99
the relative density is zero right

1067.0 --> 1073.519
inside the container because the water

1070.99 --> 1075.409
because it is full of water the

1073.519 --> 1077.539
container itself is full of water and

1075.409 --> 1080.72
inside the container the relative

1077.539 --> 1084.5
density would be zero wouldn't it no now

1080.72 --> 1087.26
relative density is in fact it's only a

1084.5 --> 1091.129
relative density in relation to another

1087.26 --> 1093.649
medium yeah because there isn't another

1091.129 --> 1097.01
medium in the container the relative

1093.649 --> 1099.4399999999998
density would be zero right there isn't

1097.01 --> 1101.87
any other medium so it has an

1099.44 --> 1106.8500000000001
equilibrium that's how that's referred

1101.87 --> 1113.6789999999999
to so then you have and then you poke a

1106.85 --> 1117.79
hole on top right of the container so

1113.679 --> 1125.38
relative density tells me that

1117.79 --> 1129.37
the tenser things will we'll go to the

1125.38 --> 1134.0200000000002
less dense things right no so I mean

1129.37 --> 1136.6899999999998
they will find their relative the higher

1134.02 --> 1141.76
dense things will find their relative

1136.69 --> 1147.88
higher density location or position in

1141.76 --> 1150.04
relation to the less dense so that's how

1147.88 --> 1153.13
they said they and they try to keep

1150.04 --> 1156.61
directionality out it completely but

1153.13 --> 1159.19
that's only basically a technical lawyer

1156.61 --> 1161.4699999999998
trick and it works it's kind of

1159.19 --> 1164.17
irritating to me but it works it is

1161.47 --> 1166.21
technically correct yeah because that's

1164.17 --> 1169.3200000000002
why they keep on doing that but yet

1166.21 --> 1173.02
there's obviously a very clear direction

1169.32 --> 1174.6399999999999
because of course they always say no

1173.02 --> 1177.31
there isn't a clear direction yet there

1174.64 --> 1180.91
is because otherwise the water would go

1177.31 --> 1183.31
would flow out the container if you put

1180.91 --> 1185.5
a hole if you make a hole on top of it

1183.31 --> 1187.1499999999999
the same as it would flow out the

1185.5 --> 1189.88
container if you would make a hole on

1187.15 --> 1192.5500000000002
the bottom it wouldn't matter because

1189.88 --> 1194.1100000000001
there has to be if relative density

1192.55 --> 1197.32
thing is true right there has to be a

1194.11 --> 1199.24
downward direction whatsoever right and

1197.32 --> 1202.3
there's even more at play there's also

1199.24 --> 1206.92
the pressures if you have very sensitive

1202.3 --> 1210.6599999999999
local pressure devices stuck to the

1206.92 --> 1214.6000000000001
entire inside of the aquarium yeah every

1210.66 --> 1216.73
few inches or whatever and you put that

1214.6 --> 1218.4099999999999
water in there and the pressure would be

1216.73 --> 1220.54
due sensors would be sensitive enough

1218.41 --> 1224.74
then you would have a clear read out

1220.54 --> 1227.77
where the top a sensors in the aquarium

1224.74 --> 1229.93
would have some pressure and the bottom

1227.77 --> 1233.65
ones would have a lot more and the

1229.93 --> 1236.8
entire floor of it will have a constant

1233.65 --> 1241.6000000000001
high pressure showing a clear pressure

1236.8 --> 1245.02
gradient so there is a difference this

1241.6 --> 1249.49
is all just there that that's all now

1245.02 --> 1252.01
saying good gravy here but yeah it's an

1249.49 --> 1254.8
operation that heavily suggested

1252.01 --> 1256.93
yeah I agree and what I I think I

1254.8 --> 1261.6699999999998
pointed out at the beginning when I

1256.93 --> 1265.27
still was a globe offer was for some

1261.67 --> 1267.76
reason if I mean relative density for

1265.27 --> 1270.07
first of all it isn't the force I mean

1267.76 --> 1275.11
things only move if you apply a force to

1270.07 --> 1277.53
it but for my experience and if you if

1275.11 --> 1280.9299999999998
you let something go in a vacuum chamber

1277.53 --> 1284.08
the relative density if there are like

1280.93 --> 1288.88
five air molecules the relative density

1284.08 --> 1292.48
should be so high that the object would

1288.88 --> 1295.3300000000002
almost fall down I don't know the speed

1292.48 --> 1299.68
of light yeah instantaneous replacement

1295.33 --> 1302.6499999999999
yeah yeah they have no nothing really to

1299.68 --> 1307.29
address the displacement although they

1302.65 --> 1307.2900000000002
could probably if they he wanted to I

1307.89 --> 1313.5400000000002
guess call it like an ether effect but

1311.89 --> 1316.2700000000002
yet I don't prove that either that's

1313.54 --> 1318.19
look that's the problem mostly there are

1316.27 --> 1320.56
so many things out there and so little

1318.19 --> 1323.3200000000002
you can actually technically prove

1320.56 --> 1326.74
scientifically but yeah so obviously

1323.32 --> 1330.1299999999999
there it's kind of something there

1326.74 --> 1334.78
because you can just white multiple

1330.13 --> 1337.0900000000001
angle deduction I find it I find the

1334.78 --> 1340.57
kind of ridiculous instead of like I'm

1337.09 --> 1344.1699999999998
saying yeah all right we don't know why

1340.57 --> 1348.1
things fall down or we don't know what

1344.17 --> 1349.93
causes relative density just say yeah

1348.1 --> 1352.4499999999998
it's relative that this or say yeah it's

1349.93 --> 1354.88
relative density that's it right nothing

1352.45 --> 1357.3600000000001
else and no but they're basically

1354.88 --> 1361.69
addressing the cause of displacement

1357.36 --> 1364.12
that's it they're they're replacing the

1361.69 --> 1366.3400000000001
two standard dropping the mic this is

1364.12 --> 1368.4399999999998
gravity thing yeah

1366.34 --> 1372.6699999999998
that's what it's it that's what it's

1368.44 --> 1376.27
there for after that all right with the

1372.67 --> 1380.64
functional theory that can actually be

1376.27 --> 1384.55
proven that's the whole task

1380.64 --> 1385.01
yeah and of course there's more yeah I'm

1384.55 --> 1386.45
either

1385.01 --> 1388.91
to be more there are so many things

1386.45 --> 1395.89
can't be explained by relative density

1388.91 --> 1400.16
I'm really more in the polarized or the

1395.89 --> 1405.38
electrical polarization theory although

1400.16 --> 1407.5400000000002
yeah there are some people that I got I

1405.38 --> 1410.8700000000001
got some signs that there might be

1407.54 --> 1414.83
something to it but yeah it will show

1410.87 --> 1417.6799999999998
clearly this must be it should be

1414.83 --> 1420.1399999999999
multiple in a very and even simulate

1417.68 --> 1423.0800000000002
able and I'd like to see that I'd like

1420.14 --> 1427.4
to see a real 3d simulation of such a

1423.08 --> 1429.56
setup and see if it is like or if it is

1427.4 --> 1432.41
as I originally presumed like static

1429.56 --> 1435.8
electricity unstable Co static

1432.41 --> 1439.19
electricity is and it's not clear up and

1435.8 --> 1440.8999999999999
down polarization could potentially do

1439.19 --> 1443.78
that more but if it's static electricity

1440.9 --> 1447.0800000000002
that goes into all directions so yeah

1443.78 --> 1449.6
things stick to each other but they also

1447.08 --> 1452.03
they stick to whatever is closed so it's

1449.6 --> 1454.55
very like a very local miniature gravity

1452.03 --> 1456.68
and that's not logical that's not what

1454.55 --> 1464.33
we see in this world but maybe a

1456.68 --> 1468.0800000000002
polarized field above and below here I I

1464.33 --> 1472.9399999999998
heard something similar from goat ISM

1468.08 --> 1477.6499999999999
for all and he I think he tried to

1472.94 --> 1482.3
explain it to me briefly about the

1477.65 --> 1486.17
electric field and so but I haven't seen

1482.3 --> 1491.26
any evidence of it yes maybe if this

1486.17 --> 1494.69
were investigating but yeah I don't know

1491.26 --> 1499.99
it's kind of strange too because the

1494.69 --> 1499.99
electric field would wouldn't it like

1500.05 --> 1511.0
wouldn't its influence metallic objects

1506.3 --> 1514.61
more than nonmetallic like I don't know

1511.0 --> 1518.75
like more Buddha influence I earn more

1514.61 --> 1522.4099999999999
than dropper or static electricity

1518.75 --> 1525.02
it can be isolated all that yeah so the

1522.41 --> 1527.9
remedy can't be isolated it's our D

1525.02 --> 1531.34
presumed gravity whatever is causing the

1527.9 --> 1537.1100000000001
standards directional displacement and

1531.34 --> 1540.6799999999998
gradients yeah that is very persistent

1537.11 --> 1545.9299999999998
it's not discriminatory it's very

1540.68 --> 1549.26
related directly to mass to relative

1545.93 --> 1553.75
density yeah it's not that

1549.26 --> 1557.29
definitely not static electricity yeah I

1553.75 --> 1561.8
I find it kind of strange because you

1557.29 --> 1564.95
know the gravity the Einstein's gravity

1561.8 --> 1566.87
which I believe before like the curving

1564.95 --> 1571.39
of space-time

1566.87 --> 1576.4099999999999
of course if if this would be true there

1571.39 --> 1580.88
couldn't be a flat F at all right but I

1576.41 --> 1583.8200000000002
don't really accept this as a fact it is

1580.88 --> 1586.43
a nice theory that's I mean that kinda

1583.82 --> 1589.27
adds up in itself but I don't accept

1586.43 --> 1593.24
this fact because I've never seen a

1589.27 --> 1595.22
reliable proof of it sorry what exactly

1593.24 --> 1597.83
what theory

1595.22 --> 1602.06
Einstein's gravity feel good fear of

1597.83 --> 1605.57
gravity curving Oh star trekky in

1602.06 --> 1610.73
gravity fields in the anomaly space is

1605.57 --> 1614.27
what I believed before i kinda became a

1610.73 --> 1616.58
flutter for but um now you never know

1614.27 --> 1620.18
the funny the freaking funny thing about

1616.58 --> 1622.82
it is it can work on a flat because it

1620.18 --> 1626.3600000000001
all makes it relative it makes it into

1622.82 --> 1630.62
like an artificial field and doesn't

1626.36 --> 1632.99
necessarily even say how so yeah maybe

1630.62 --> 1636.4399999999998
maybe I was right it doesn't actually

1632.99 --> 1639.83
exclude any model it's just an indicator

1636.44 --> 1644.8700000000001
like yeah it's just a localized

1639.83 --> 1648.26
phenomena a field and it decreases in

1644.87 --> 1648.4099999999999
over distance maybe in relation to the

1648.26 --> 1651.97
earth

1648.41 --> 1654.53
oh yeah that's speculative even

1651.97 --> 1656.45
look with the Einstein in gravity the

1654.53 --> 1660.22
funny thing is you could speculate okay

1656.45 --> 1663.8600000000001
the gravity is caused by the matter

1660.22 --> 1666.59
exerting that force or the matter simply

1663.86 --> 1671.4199999999998
has gathered because that force was

1666.59 --> 1674.1789999999999
there you don't know that and see ya and

1671.42 --> 1676.4
when you realize that then literally any

1674.179 --> 1679.94
type of model is possible because it's

1676.4 --> 1681.92
simply okay whatever gravity forces are

1679.94 --> 1685.309
mysteriously there for some reason

1681.92 --> 1687.5
reason created maintains that both

1685.309 --> 1688.55
typically cause things to settle in a

1687.5 --> 1692.99
specific way

1688.55 --> 1695.57
whatever matter is present it gets kind

1692.99 --> 1700.58
of complicated on their model when it

1695.57 --> 1704.54
comes to what is gravity right and what

1700.58 --> 1707.6499999999999
gives the way to the atoms and so and

1704.54 --> 1712.67
then you have to go into Expos ons and

1707.65 --> 1717.23
like stuff like this that was supposedly

1712.67 --> 1720.8600000000001
discovered in CERN in the LHC right so

1717.23 --> 1725.96
it gets kinda kind of complicated I

1720.86 --> 1729.9499999999998
think but in terms of Einstein's gravity

1725.96 --> 1735.23
I see I always thought that if he was

1729.95 --> 1737.51
right then the earth couldn't be even

1735.23 --> 1741.35
flat because it would collapse in itself

1737.51 --> 1745.16
right because if the more mass there is

1741.35 --> 1747.9499999999998
the more attraction the more it tries to

1745.16 --> 1751.5500000000002
pull everything towards itself so it

1747.95 --> 1754.1000000000001
would naturally become a sphere if he

1751.55 --> 1757.33
was right so this is the reason why

1754.1 --> 1761.2099999999998
that's only if you presuppose that

1757.33 --> 1765.4399999999998
matter is actually the center point of

1761.21 --> 1770.23
the gravity attraction of forces yeah

1765.44 --> 1774.41
and that's not set in that theory

1770.23 --> 1776.99
because it's all relative it's all a

1774.41 --> 1779.03
matter of approach as I just said you

1776.99 --> 1780.71
could say okay yeah it is caused by that

1779.03 --> 1783.1689999999999
matter that's why the fields are there

1780.71 --> 1783.98
or no those fields were there and that's

1783.169 --> 1784.7900000000002
why the matter

1783.98 --> 1787.55
gathered

1784.79 --> 1789.4099999999999
as it did and it would naturally do so

1787.55 --> 1793.87
because the fields were present at that

1789.41 --> 1797.24
position so it doesn't exclude that

1793.87 --> 1803.03
could be I don't know I've never I mean

1797.24 --> 1805.67
I've never looked into them yeah it's a

1803.03 --> 1807.41
very ethereal theory I find it kind of

1805.67 --> 1810.76
interesting because of that because it

1807.41 --> 1815.42
is so conceptual hmm so you mean like

1810.76 --> 1821.45
there is like a field on the earth like

1815.42 --> 1825.77
a thin field or so that is you could say

1821.45 --> 1829.19
it is gravity and it's the steady pull

1825.77 --> 1831.8
everything down directional like

1829.19 --> 1836.3600000000001
directional constant field where just

1831.8 --> 1839.18
there is it whatever and then yeah that

1836.36 --> 1841.55
who knows how that works if there is a

1839.18 --> 1843.65
variation in this then that may all be

1841.55 --> 1846.02
constant or there may be places where

1843.65 --> 1851.1200000000001
it's just less layers where it's even

1846.02 --> 1854.9
pretty extreme yeah goes the other way

1851.12 --> 1857.3899999999999
you know yeah it would be really

1854.9 --> 1861.2
interesting because that would also

1857.39 --> 1861.6200000000001
explain the almost 10 meter per second

1861.2 --> 1866.45
squared

1861.62 --> 1868.58
drop from you know were newly the object

1866.45 --> 1870.2
fall that it will drop at 10 meter per

1868.58 --> 1873.1699999999998
second square I mean the maximum

1870.2 --> 1875.9
velocity yeah like in a vacuum the

1873.17 --> 1878.39
maximum excellent the steady

1875.9 --> 1884.45
acceleration which is kinda the same

1878.39 --> 1888.0800000000002
everywhere if if you exclude what NASA

1884.45 --> 1891.17
wants to tell us right because for

1888.08 --> 1893.81
example data just made a gravitational

1891.17 --> 1896.93
method whatsoever which I say all right

1893.81 --> 1899.87
it's probably it's [ __ ] right but

1896.93 --> 1902.75
maybe maybe there are there are places

1899.87 --> 1905.33
where things get pulled down a little

1902.75 --> 1907.76
bit stronger than at other places I

1905.33 --> 1911.21
don't know it's all a matter of finding

1907.76 --> 1914.27
that out yeah you can't just drop stuff

1911.21 --> 1916.46
in different heights in the open air

1914.27 --> 1918.7
yeah that it will yield differences

1916.46 --> 1922.39
because of the pressure differ

1918.7 --> 1929.059
that matters a lot because that's the

1922.39 --> 1931.5200000000002
sabia the friction that prevents the and

1929.059 --> 1933.74
that also yields a maximum velocity at

1931.52 --> 1936.59
some points that's the the the weird

1933.74 --> 1940.07
thing about it because of the air

1936.59 --> 1944.87
friction the medium friction a maximum

1940.07 --> 1946.97
velocity becomes set there on the vacuum

1944.87 --> 1949.82
that apparently doesn't do that so you

1946.97 --> 1953.179
get the you get the typical maximum

1949.82 --> 1955.309
acceleration rate and again that's

1953.179 --> 1957.3200000000002
another part of the gravity aberration

1955.309 --> 1960.9189999999999
that they cleverly grafted into the

1957.32 --> 1964.1299999999999
system yeah it's really interesting

1960.919 --> 1968.1200000000001
because in order to prove it you would

1964.13 --> 1971.0
either have you would either need a

1968.12 --> 1973.61
really really big vacuum chamber where

1971.0 --> 1976.809
you can matter but you can measure the

1973.61 --> 1979.9699999999998
differences in in acceleration of

1976.809 --> 1983.24
objects falling down would be kinda

1979.97 --> 1983.98
ridiculous but it doesn't need to be

1983.24 --> 1987.679
that big

1983.98 --> 1990.83
no if it's just a really reliable vacuum

1987.679 --> 1993.14
chamber yeah doesn't need to be probably

1990.83 --> 1996.649
a few meters high but yeah you could

1993.14 --> 1999.89
just take it with you to other locations

1996.649 --> 2003.61
and just see if the so-called distance

1999.89 --> 2007.21
to the earth should matter in the exact

2003.61 --> 2009.37
same vacuum chamber and see if the

2007.21 --> 2011.409
acceleration rate changes or if it's

2009.37 --> 2014.62
exactly the same that's basically how

2011.409 --> 2018.5200000000002
you know how you find out I proposed

2014.62 --> 2021.6399999999999
this like in one of the earlier Flat

2018.52 --> 2025.299
Earth talks already yeah I don't thank

2021.64 --> 2027.669
you chambers the only real way to to

2025.299 --> 2029.35
determine if there is a variation yeah

2027.669 --> 2032.98
because otherwise as you said there is

2029.35 --> 2036.9399999999998
pressure differences everywhere so you

2032.98 --> 2041.6490000000001
can't rely on it and the other manners

2036.94 --> 2043.929
of like gravitation meters all that

2041.649 --> 2046.3799999999999
stuff I don't trust that at all I don't

2043.929 --> 2050.32
know what the freaking and all that is

2046.38 --> 2053.7200000000003
but this is a very yet

2050.32 --> 2056.8990000000003
maybe a bit sluggish babe yeah it's not

2053.72 --> 2059.419
very convenient little device to do this

2056.899 --> 2065.54
but it is reliable and it is very basic

2059.419 --> 2069.4089999999997
and that's essential I mean you could

2065.54 --> 2072.47
also take a let's say a spring or so

2069.409 --> 2074.57
right and also put it in a vacuum

2072.47 --> 2078.2599999999998
chamber and you have you need a really

2074.57 --> 2083.0
really really precise device that can

2078.26 --> 2085.639
measure differences in micrometers but

2083.0 --> 2088.369
in terms of distance because if the

2085.639 --> 2090.9190000000003
gravity gets stronger the spring will be

2088.369 --> 2094.339
pulled a little bit stronger that is how

2090.919 --> 2098.089
the gravity the gravitation meters kind

2094.339 --> 2101.089
of work so I like that but the issue is

2098.089 --> 2103.94
also look if the supposed forces

2101.089 --> 2108.619
equilibrium changes then it will also

2103.94 --> 2113.9
have an effect on the spring itself and

2108.619 --> 2117.08
not the way I did yeah if you have like

2113.9 --> 2120.6800000000003
a net if it if you have like I let all

2117.08 --> 2125.0299999999997
like one kilogram and two spring you

2120.68 --> 2127.7
have a small spring or so on you can

2125.03 --> 2130.19
then see the differences how the are for

2127.7 --> 2133.5499999999997
the string stretchers I think it would

2130.19 --> 2137.75
stretch stronger or a foot stretch it

2133.55 --> 2141.0800000000004
would be longer than when the gravity

2137.75 --> 2142.7
would be less right I mean when the

2141.08 --> 2144.38
gravity is more it would be longer when

2142.7 --> 2149.359
the gravity is less it'll be short or

2144.38 --> 2153.8900000000003
just spring maybe yeah it does sound

2149.359 --> 2155.81
reasonable I don't know how many times

2153.89 --> 2157.16
you could use such a device before the

2155.81 --> 2161.69
spring starts to falter

2157.16 --> 2164.08
I don't engines on these things no maybe

2161.69 --> 2168.14
it's not if you have a really reliable

2164.08 --> 2174.4
expensive industrial spring that could

2168.14 --> 2174.4
probably work yeah yeah you were

2174.67 --> 2178.13
interesting

2175.82 --> 2180.6800000000003
yeah look I am interesting at these

2178.13 --> 2182.69
phenomena like even the stories by these

2180.68 --> 2183.6189999999997
ballers that the gravity is supposed the

2182.69 --> 2186.4990000000003
difference

2183.619 --> 2188.6600000000003
at equator s at the poles because of the

2186.499 --> 2190.609
speed of the earth and there's all they

2188.66 --> 2194.509
love that so much because it spin up the

2190.609 --> 2196.339
earth but I don't know I'm just really

2194.509 --> 2199.789
interested is there some kind of

2196.339 --> 2202.009
difference for this equilibrium present

2199.789 --> 2203.599
and yeah if there were I'm not gonna

2202.009 --> 2206.45
assume that's going to be because of

2203.599 --> 2209.029
spin of the earth but it's just

2206.45 --> 2213.739
interesting as a phenomenon I just want

2209.029 --> 2216.109
to know where it is the layout and there

2213.739 --> 2220.849
is supposedly a map that even says that

2216.109 --> 2224.89
yeah for example there is a low gravity

2220.849 --> 2229.759
was it or higher gravity either one very

2224.89 --> 2234.109
remarkable difference and I want to know

2229.759 --> 2239.14
like is that is that real how did they

2234.109 --> 2242.479
measure that did they use this method

2239.14 --> 2247.7
and would be it's just fascinating like

2242.479 --> 2249.3799999999997
why yeah you're right it always kind of

2247.7 --> 2252.109
fascinated me because I never accepted

2249.38 --> 2255.2000000000003
the relative density explanation to

2252.109 --> 2258.8289999999997
boards why things fall but um excuse me

2255.2 --> 2261.41
five minutes I'm cooking something right

2258.829 --> 2264.7000000000003
now and I don't want it to get burned be

2261.41 --> 2264.7
right back all right

2276.54 --> 2285.24
indeed race Rafi magnetism is radio

2281.22 --> 2289.0699999999997
that's right so so one of the reasons

2285.24 --> 2292.5899999999997
why earlier a reason out that gravity

2289.07 --> 2296.51
cannot be magnetism that magnetism can

2292.59 --> 2299.7000000000003
explain that those effects that's right

2296.51 --> 2305.7200000000003
and explain the aberration can't explain

2299.7 --> 2309.2999999999997
these phenomena split in my gravity is

2305.72 --> 2315.93
real gravitational pull is not hang out

2309.3 --> 2318.26
further stocks and lot of activity in

2315.93 --> 2318.2599999999998
chat

2329.9 --> 2345.06
Shane good goodtimz for all would read

2335.45 --> 2355.97
agencies in here course most Azra are

2345.06 --> 2359.42
they the G Gonzalez raise your f e

2355.97 --> 2359.4199999999996
clearly flat earth

2364.78 --> 2368.92
uh-huh guys already added in chat it's

2368.44 --> 2373.9500000000003
cool

2368.92 --> 2373.9500000000003
Oh some nurse

2377.66 --> 2380.73
[Music]

2382.69 --> 2395.289
the headquarters TC welcome and Ares 106

2390.789 --> 2397.529
ah the plain truth hi Travis are you

2395.289 --> 2397.529
doing

2398.339 --> 2403.65
so yeah it's in your summer break

2416.78 --> 2423.32
hmmm nice quote there from Richard

2419.75 --> 2425.9
Feynman I would rather have questions

2423.32 --> 2429.0800000000004
that can't be answered then answers that

2425.9 --> 2440.03
can be questioned that's genius sell

2429.08 --> 2453.7999999999997
true thanks for that ah yes a good

2440.03 --> 2457.5400000000004
conversation still cold so annoying need

2453.8 --> 2457.54
to warm up I just want to feel warm

2471.839 --> 2483.339
anyway yeah it was a good discussion

2479.709 --> 2486.459
with in there about aberration of

2483.339 --> 2489.729
gravity and the problem surrounding it

2486.459 --> 2494.3799999999997
and the Flat Earth community and the

2489.729 --> 2497.709
debates of the density theory yeah it's

2494.38 --> 2502.65
good to talk about that again with

2497.709 --> 2502.6499999999996
somebody who's who's reasonable

2530.55 --> 2542.96
is that the dielectric theory is that

2537.8 --> 2542.96
basically the polarization concept

2548.349 --> 2552.1800000000003
I'm asking race Rafi

2570.18 --> 2583.049
no but magnetism no sorry magnetism is

2574.73 --> 2587.789
radial as I said earlier yeah a

2583.049 --> 2591.47
polarization sure it's not gonna be

2587.789 --> 2591.4700000000003
magnetic not really

2595.05 --> 2604.59
it's not gonna be a regular

2596.87 --> 2607.2799999999997
electrostatic either so yes needs

2604.59 --> 2607.28
working on

2612.74 --> 2620.81
okay magnetism is Radio die electricity

2617.96 --> 2624.58
is the opposite okay so what is the

2620.81 --> 2624.58
opposite of radio tell me

2630.59 --> 2644.6800000000003
uh-uh no you just tell me I'm not really

2641.05 --> 2644.6800000000003
into technobabble

2654.2 --> 2662.1499999999996
I dunno how electricity and magnetism

2659.21 --> 2666.859
are directly interrelated and that the

2662.15 --> 2669.44
change of electron state into magnetic

2666.859 --> 2674.99
field I understand that concept that's

2669.44 --> 2679.94
fine but die electricity is not really

2674.99 --> 2682.1299999999997
directly involved in that concept as far

2679.94 --> 2684.76
as I know or is it that but yeah then

2682.13 --> 2687.8
it's just the state of magnetism and

2684.76 --> 2691.07
yeah electricity is part of matter that

2687.8 --> 2693.71
kind of thing so that doesn't really

2691.07 --> 2698.839
give an explanation as to this

2693.71 --> 2700.55
mysterious very constant effect of force

2698.839 --> 2705.97
disequilibrium that applies to all

2700.55 --> 2705.9700000000003
matter and doesn't leave any measurable

2707.89 --> 2711.79
cause so

2720.51 --> 2727.92
the modality within the ether but yeah

2725.39 --> 2737.94
you're saying if there is involved

2727.92 --> 2746.099
serious the is that like the atmospheric

2737.94 --> 2748.589
electricity or is that or yeah because

2746.099 --> 2751.2200000000003
the ether if you mean the ether as in

2748.589 --> 2757.41
the thing that actually causes light to

2751.22 --> 2760.14
slow down to a constant speed then okay

2757.41 --> 2762.2999999999997
I don't see how that involves

2760.14 --> 2764.7599999999998
electricity at all but if you're talking

2762.3 --> 2770.94
about atmospheric electricity that's

2764.76 --> 2774.869
something else and that doesn't

2770.94 --> 2779.609
necessarily point at polarization unless

2774.869 --> 2783.1800000000003
it can be explained as to how that field

2779.609 --> 2787.44
would interact with the matter in that

2783.18 --> 2791.3999999999996
it would cause this polarization so yeah

2787.44 --> 2793.17
look I am NOT trying to be like not

2791.4 --> 2796.56
trying to break it down I'm just trying

2793.17 --> 2799.41
to be I'm trying to critically approach

2796.56 --> 2801.5099999999998
it because I think there may be

2799.41 --> 2803.79
something to it but yeah you can't just

2801.51 --> 2806.099
assume things you have to build the

2803.79 --> 2808.97
connection you have to figure out how it

2806.099 --> 2808.9700000000003
actually connects

2814.98 --> 2819.47
yeah that's that speculation

2824.9 --> 2830.67
yeah that is seriously that reminds me

2827.88 --> 2836.13
of Star Trek reasoning and it is really

2830.67 --> 2840.119
interesting it's a nice concept but yeah

2836.13 --> 2842.5190000000002
I'd like to see some proof because this

2840.119 --> 2846.4500000000003
falls into the same category as claiming

2842.519 --> 2849.9599999999996
that gravity is the cause of so many

2846.45 --> 2852.47
other things and everything because yeah

2849.96 --> 2857.339
the ether so the ether prove it prove

2852.47 --> 2859.64
that proof what it is prove what causes

2857.339 --> 2859.64
it

2866.28 --> 2869.1200000000003
all right

2870.54 --> 2875.92
right

2872.89 --> 2878.29
you race your Fe man you gotta get on my

2875.92 --> 2880.39
show or sometimes I think we would have

2878.29 --> 2884.05
some really interesting conversations

2880.39 --> 2887.2599999999998
about this and I think you'd probably do

2884.05 --> 2898.21
much better than just responding to me

2887.26 --> 2901.3
talking in chat so yet add me on skype

2898.21 --> 2904.23
man and join my early bird show sometime

2901.3 --> 2904.23
that would be really cool

2932.59 --> 2937.48
right well I don't know where's in their

2934.45 --> 2948.85
wind but yeah we've got 10 more minutes

2937.48 --> 2953.58
left for the show it's hilarious when

2948.85 --> 2953.58
weirdos make good points but yeah I know

2953.7 --> 2964.06
there is no proof that electrons Prada

2958.8 --> 2968.8900000000003
protons or singular atoms are actual

2964.06 --> 2971.23
separate entities although if you

2968.89 --> 2977.68
approach approach it through chemistry

2971.23 --> 2983.05
as a mesh based on weight it does work

2977.68 --> 2986.5899999999997
out remarkably well so again it's no

2983.05 --> 2990.4
proof but it measures out so well to not

2986.59 --> 2993.9900000000002
assume orden to not use that model

2990.4 --> 2999.58
because you can't actually prove it is

2993.99 --> 3001.5
just stupid because it works doesn't

2999.58 --> 3004.85
mean that it is absolute but it works

3001.5 --> 3007.89
again another - another tool of

3004.85 --> 3010.14
engineering that is very practical just

3007.89 --> 3013.2599999999998
like gravity yeah in the architecture

3010.14 --> 3017.31
gravity is very useful it works doesn't

3013.26 --> 3019.5800000000004
mean it is real but it works a great

3017.31 --> 3019.58
tool

3026.52 --> 3033.79
all right that's very funny

3030.46 --> 3038.349
Laurie but yeah we already delved into

3033.79 --> 3041.89
that and I accept the basic matter

3038.349 --> 3046.54
theory but yeah there's a lot of

3041.89 --> 3047.68
speculation there as well and a look as

3046.54 --> 3051.79
long as things work out

3047.68 --> 3054.69
it's practically usable but we have to

3051.79 --> 3057.73
look everywhere there are probably

3054.69 --> 3060.88
presumptions grafted-in

3057.73 --> 3065.29
about things it's very easy it's typical

3060.88 --> 3067.7200000000003
what we do we find phenomena we figure

3065.29 --> 3073.0299999999997
out oh wow look at the coherency in this

3067.72 --> 3074.7999999999997
it must be a thing but yeah it's kind of

3073.03 --> 3077.32
hard to scientifically prove it but yes

3074.8 --> 3081.27
the thing okay we're gonna just take it

3077.32 --> 3084.67
for granted and yeah that's how you

3081.27 --> 3091.03
sound we did they deal with gravity it's

3084.67 --> 3096.01
how they deal with the atom theory yeah

3091.03 --> 3100.0600000000004
it's not proven not really but yeah it

3096.01 --> 3103.05
is widely deducible that's the thing and

3100.06 --> 3105.64
yeah if you take wide deduce ability as

3103.05 --> 3108.76
scientific proof which is technically

3105.64 --> 3110.77
incorrect yeah then look things become a

3108.76 --> 3114.19
lot easier so many practical elements

3110.77 --> 3118.39
you can scientifically prove by vast

3114.19 --> 3120.4
deduction but that's not actually honest

3118.39 --> 3122.77
because you actually have to prove it

3120.4 --> 3125.2000000000003
and by the scientific method to prove

3122.77 --> 3127.47
that it is rayul and if you don't then

3125.2 --> 3130.7799999999997
you just got a lot of phenomena and that

3127.47 --> 3135.8489999999997
heavily suggests there is something and

3130.78 --> 3136.69
that's an aberration sorry that's how it

3135.849 --> 3139.78
really works

3136.69 --> 3143.8
that's real science that's actual

3139.78 --> 3147.4
science that not that's the real

3143.8 --> 3151.96
physical science that not just

3147.4 --> 3156.119
philosophical speculation theorizing in

3151.96 --> 3156.119
the cultural sense theorizing

3164.17 --> 3174.83
now Laurie if you really think that you

3167.15 --> 3177.29
can try to play us any of us but you're

3174.83 --> 3182.09
delusional you're seriously delusional

3177.29 --> 3185.99
in your power and capacity okay you're a

3182.09 --> 3189.32
weak guy and you seem damaged like even

3185.99 --> 3198.9399999999996
in the moment you showed yourself see it

3189.32 --> 3203.03
all over you so I think yeah you know

3198.94 --> 3206.93
you're just trying to pretend you're

3203.03 --> 3209.51
this mighty person here that can

3206.93 --> 3213.08
manipulate the movement or whatever it's

3209.51 --> 3215.2700000000004
ridiculous you don't do [ __ ] you just

3213.08 --> 3220.7599999999998
make it look yourself look like an idiot

3215.27 --> 3227.24
all the time really and very annoying

3220.76 --> 3230.8100000000004
it's just bad character so and all these

3227.24 --> 3232.39
calls for keeping it civil oh don't do

3230.81 --> 3236.87
this don't do that

3232.39 --> 3240.62
look that's really freaking annoying

3236.87 --> 3244.25
when you constantly constantly use

3240.62 --> 3246.08
devious tactics and never answer

3244.25 --> 3249.83
straight questions even when it's easy

3246.08 --> 3252.52
and constantly strawman and red herring

3249.83 --> 3256.52
the [ __ ] out of every single thing that

3252.52 --> 3260.15
is brought up you know you to then start

3256.52 --> 3262.34
pointing fingers at others like oh you

3260.15 --> 3267.26
need you being uncivil you're being
