3.589 --> 10.53
good morning welcome to flatters

6.96 --> 16.8
earlybird number 76 I'm your host

10.53 --> 19.83
Arwen and it's cold it's very very cold

16.8 --> 23.64
outside no new snow added to it but it's

19.83 --> 32.43
just the same snow it's just frozen

23.64 --> 39.17
solid I went to go bicycling through it

32.43 --> 41.879
it's just freezing like I had gloves on

39.17 --> 45.96
really good leather gloves kind of new

41.879 --> 49.05
and either like after I arrived it's

45.96 --> 51.480000000000004
like okay taking the gloves off now

49.05 --> 56.149
feeling my head it's frozen

51.48 --> 56.148999999999994
oof cold very very cold

57.43 --> 63.38
I don't do all that well

59.88 --> 63.38
in bad cold

63.58 --> 67.84
moderate temperature kinda guy

70.36 --> 79.18
so yeah yesterday was interesting

75.09 --> 81.69
second hangout hold on I need to fix

79.18 --> 81.69000000000001
something here

100.79 --> 103.45
see

107.71 --> 114.36
yeah I had a sudden connection

110.47 --> 114.36
interruption weird

116.53 --> 119.19
right

120.159 --> 127.539
and yeah my backup panel drops out of my

126.039 --> 132.4
own hangout because of it

127.539 --> 137.62
so but I'm back now in there so if

132.4 --> 139.89000000000001
anyone wants to join the panel you can

137.62 --> 139.89000000000001
do it

142.04 --> 145.04
distraction

145.49 --> 153.56900000000002
yeah I had a second hang out yesterday

148.11 --> 156.29000000000002
and you know was a different audience

153.569 --> 156.29
kinda

156.68 --> 162.799
and we talked a lot about Concha Pete

160.36 --> 168.86
and it was kind of weird

162.799 --> 170.69
in retrospect because I basically had

168.86 --> 174.019
this elaborate talk and I still stand

170.69 --> 176.989
behind most of what I said but it's kind

174.019 --> 179.59900000000002
of odds because after that I look back

176.989 --> 183.379
and watch the entire thing and basically

179.599 --> 186.409
ignored Tim just kind of important if

183.379 --> 192.53
you actually want to see what's going on

186.409 --> 198.47
there and I had underestimated it I

192.53 --> 202.7
think I think that my sympathy for for

198.47 --> 206.89
Pancho Pete basically colored the way I

202.7 --> 210.61999999999998
looked at it because it turned out to be

206.89 --> 211.069
more maniacal basically than I first

210.62 --> 214.73000000000002
thought

211.069 --> 218.29899999999998
like he really did went just completely

214.73 --> 221.599
apeshit out of nowhere and it wasn't as

218.299 --> 223.94
I thought it was at first but yeah it's

221.599 --> 226.31
still the same issue like the guy has

223.94 --> 227.989
problems and yeah I'm not gonna spend

226.31 --> 231.739
like another entire show talking about

227.989 --> 236.599
it but it's just weird to me like how my

231.739 --> 241.76
sympathy for the guy kind of cut me off

236.599 --> 244.569
a little from seeing the true depths of

241.76 --> 248.48
what was going on so yeah that's

244.569 --> 252.5
psychology I guess but it was pretty bad

248.48 --> 254.89999999999998
it like yeah it's not it's not something

252.5 --> 257.769
that even needed to be overemphasized

254.9 --> 257.769
it was just bad

258.019 --> 267.139
sad it happened anyway

263.35 --> 271.88
things are interesting yeah sorry I was

267.139 --> 274.22
late for a bit in this case it was my

271.88 --> 277.96999999999997
fault because I decided to call my

274.22 --> 279.08000000000004
heater and I'd been trying to call for

277.97 --> 281.41900000000004
days

279.08 --> 287.15
it was very very busy apparently and he

281.419 --> 288.94899999999996
was off to Germany so yeah busy with

287.15 --> 290.96
that stuff so that's why you contacted

288.949 --> 292.97
me because yeah since the Blood Moon and

290.96 --> 296.9
everything and I went sick and all that

292.97 --> 300.139
[ __ ] happened I felt like oh my god am I

296.9 --> 303.71
being approached by these beings that

300.139 --> 306.199
are potentially involving themselves

303.71 --> 308.12
with me are they Luciferians are the

306.199 --> 311.539
aromanians or are they something else

308.12 --> 319.25
what is that and yeah he talked to me

311.539 --> 324.65
about it and he blew my mind just you

319.25 --> 329.24
know like even he doesn't leave a flat

324.65 --> 332.21
earth but he is wise [ __ ] incredible and

329.24 --> 334.94
I can't explain it

332.21 --> 341.57
a Marvel's me every time but I try to

334.94 --> 344.03
explain about the Tarte Aryans and about

341.57 --> 346.88
what we've seen the books and what

344.03 --> 348.59
Martin Ithaca showed and just the oddity

346.88 --> 351.889
of it all and not having seen it before

348.59 --> 354.79999999999995
and that there is definitely more to be

351.889 --> 359.12
learned and then talked about the dreams

354.8 --> 361.969
that I had as a kid and mother and all

359.12 --> 366.08
that thing and what that was and he

361.969 --> 370.4
shocked me shocked me pretty harshly

366.08 --> 374.139
because he basically told me that it

370.4 --> 377.13899999999995
those dreams were

374.139 --> 377.139
altered

377.26 --> 384.61
that was not yeah it's kind of harsh to

381.85 --> 388.86
hear it but I accept this judgment in

384.61 --> 391.0
this because there was no no ego

388.86 --> 396.6
perpetuating that he just said it out

391.0 --> 399.82
straight I said yeah that was like a

396.6 --> 403.06
Luciferian dream construct using the

399.82 --> 405.01
information throughout your life to try

403.06 --> 407.41
to nudge you in a direction as Lucifer

405.01 --> 414.71999999999997
typically does so it was actually not

407.41 --> 420.19
really what it was even though a lot of

414.72 --> 422.98
the mysterious aspects that I did get to

420.19 --> 425.98
see through that vision through that

422.98 --> 427.54
dream not the thing that I not the

425.98 --> 429.64000000000004
conclusion that they were trying to

427.54 --> 432.01000000000005
force me to draw but just the things

429.64 --> 437.16999999999996
that I saw there may be a lot to it so

432.01 --> 439.84
again there is this added value to the

437.17 --> 443.65000000000003
experience despite it technically being

439.84 --> 448.719
a lie it is so bizarre so bizarre to

443.65 --> 451.209
realize this but yeah

448.719 --> 456.209
there had things have happened with the

451.209 --> 460.689
tart Aryans and they probably were

456.209 --> 464.699
absolutely a a Dreamwalker like species

460.689 --> 468.459
the magical species dream Walker's

464.699 --> 470.67900000000003
aboriginals talk about this and it's

468.459 --> 477.129
just everywhere it's just in our past

470.679 --> 479.049
and it's been gotten out of the way like

477.129 --> 482.11
the controllers don't like it it is the

479.049 --> 488.13899999999995
definition of income of out of control

482.11 --> 494.8
it is it is the Oracle of the matrix it

488.139 --> 498.699
is there to create the unbalance so

494.8 --> 500.949
obvious but yeah there is more to be

498.699 --> 504.569
figured out historically as to what this

500.949 --> 504.569
is and

507.55 --> 512.92
and the battle between light and

510.01 --> 515.3199999999999
darkness it continues on and I've had a

512.92 --> 517.66
very elaborate talk about this with my

515.32 --> 521.8000000000001
healer as well and I explained to him

517.66 --> 523.81
yes I talk online to people and they

521.8 --> 525.67
have holes in their consciousness and

523.81 --> 527.6099999999999
this is how it works and they don't

525.67 --> 530.7099999999999
notice it and I can demonstrate it well

527.61 --> 533.38
when they're actually there demonstrate

530.71 --> 536.19
to my audience how it works how I say

533.38 --> 539.17
something and they can't hear it it's

536.19 --> 539.5300000000001
physically impossible for them to hear

539.17 --> 542.14
it

539.53 --> 544.99
because of that whole effect because of

542.14 --> 548.1899999999999
this weird clamp and if you press it

544.99 --> 551.23
hard enough they experience pain in the

548.19 --> 554.22
this section over here the solar plexus

551.23 --> 557.14
and when that pressure heightens up then

554.22 --> 563.89
demonic entities basically through that

557.14 --> 566.41
hole take over ya demonic entities very

563.89 --> 568.99
aromanian entities usually and he

566.41 --> 571.41
conquered absolutely a hundred percent

568.99 --> 575.77
and we've never talked about this before

571.41 --> 580.9599999999999
so that was just hmm it's on the right

575.77 --> 584.9499999999999
track I am opening up a new ethereal law

580.96 --> 587.97
here and I think I can manage it and I

584.95 --> 591.0
can do it this responsibly it is

587.97 --> 593.74
knowledge of spiritual healing and

591.0 --> 598.3
recognizing the darkness as it manifests

593.74 --> 600.42
and how it manifests in other people

598.3 --> 600.42
and

600.86 --> 605.47
also the bizarre thing about it is that

605.5 --> 611.81
all the darkness that comes out of these

608.42 --> 613.88
people when this happens when the pain

611.81 --> 615.92
becomes too high in the end the darkness

613.88 --> 620.09
manifests in their behavior it's not

615.92 --> 622.06
really them and you can feel this and if

620.09 --> 624.11
you know these people then you know it

622.06 --> 627.1999999999999
subconsciously it's not really them

624.11 --> 631.84
they're acting out it's indeed it's not

627.2 --> 635.1800000000001
their consciousness it's something else

631.84 --> 637.7900000000001
it's so miraculous how this all works

635.18 --> 640.88
and it's just completely under the on

637.79 --> 643.8199999999999
the under the tongue it's just basic

640.88 --> 647.27
intuition dealing with things but

643.82 --> 652.1500000000001
conceptually society and the conscious

647.27 --> 652.15
law is barely taking notes

660.86 --> 666.67
am I gonna discuss free adder today well

667.48 --> 678.14
sure psychology maybe I don't know it's

671.209 --> 681.8199999999999
just that look this I have my expertise

678.14 --> 685.6
and the technical sides and actually

681.82 --> 688.82
using the technical sides to duel it out

685.6 --> 691.19
Flat Earth against globert that's never

688.82 --> 696.0500000000001
been my strongest point because it

691.19 --> 699.769
drains me too much I am more of an

696.05 --> 700.9699999999999
artist like this rough battering it's

699.769 --> 703.16
just not my thing

700.97 --> 704.6600000000001
it drains me there's other people that

703.16 --> 706.55
are extremely good at it

704.66 --> 710.209
like in there like Nathan Oakley and

706.55 --> 712.55
Anthony Reilly and yeah they do it like

710.209 --> 715.9699999999999
Anthony does it now on his own shows and

712.55 --> 718.459
it's he does it very eloquently and I

715.97 --> 722.769
can do it too up to a certain point but

718.459 --> 722.7689999999999
yeah it's just not

723.45 --> 733.0500000000001
I can do it if I have to but it's never

726.93 --> 740.3299999999999
it's not my primary thing so sure I will

733.05 --> 740.3299999999999
I will talk

743.3 --> 748.9399999999999
about Flat Earth if that's required of

745.97 --> 751.6700000000001
me if any but yeah what's there to talk

748.94 --> 753.11
about really like I wanted somebody on

751.67 --> 754.9699999999999
the panel for that kind of [ __ ]

753.11 --> 759.8000000000001
could be a globe or a flat earther you

754.97 --> 762.1700000000001
know because otherwise what want me to

759.8 --> 763.52
explain my rectangular looping model

762.17 --> 767.12
again how many times have I done this

763.52 --> 770.36
and seriously if you don't get it by now

767.12 --> 773.03
the basics of that or if you just

770.36 --> 775.1
haven't watched it then do you have a

773.03 --> 777.5899999999999
hole in your consciousness that is not

775.1 --> 780.2
allowing you to just let this concept

777.59 --> 786.19
sink in as it is how many times do I

780.2 --> 790.1
have to explain it okay choosing you

786.19 --> 792.4100000000001
it's just it's really not that

790.1 --> 795.1700000000001
complicated there's just a couple of

792.41 --> 798.65
weird nudges to it you know the looping

795.17 --> 803.5999999999999
factor the presupposition of L spatial

798.65 --> 806.51
looping confine it is similar Tory in

803.6 --> 811.1
nature you can find computer things

806.51 --> 814.34
games that do exactly this well if you

811.1 --> 816.6700000000001
can suspend your disbelief and see that

814.34 --> 819.44
game then how hard is it to

816.67 --> 824.5899999999999
conceptualize that the world may have

819.44 --> 824.59
some of these aspects to it naturally

827.03 --> 832.0699999999999
that difficult to conceptualize I'm not

829.13 --> 834.23
saying it it is it has to be but it

832.07 --> 837.7700000000001
could be and there are some things to

834.23 --> 842.2
know again this is the equator a

837.77 --> 842.1999999999999
straight line or is it a circle

846.43 --> 853.0
and if you are at the north pole at the

850.42 --> 858.3
vicinity of that region the north pole

853.0 --> 858.3
or the South Pole and you move

859.29 --> 868.24
horizontally is not the right word you

861.37 --> 872.26
were it would move latitude right from

868.24 --> 875.83
its the west west to east and these

872.26 --> 878.4
regions are you walking in a circle or

875.83 --> 882.37
are you walking in the straight line

878.4 --> 887.65
that's ground zero that's where you

882.37 --> 892.69
start in defining what this place is

887.65 --> 894.79
really what the real shape is you have

892.69 --> 897.7900000000001
to get this straight you can't start out

894.79 --> 902.05
with the presupposition like if it is a

897.79 --> 905.05
disc that is all makes sense that or

902.05 --> 908.14
whatever you just got to figure out are

905.05 --> 909.9699999999999
these physical straight lines or are

908.14 --> 912.46
there circles and when you get that

909.97 --> 918.13
answer well you're absolutely certain

912.46 --> 921.84
when there's no way around it then yeah

918.13 --> 921.84
you can draw the conclusions

922.31 --> 928.4599999999999
shouldn't be that hard you know

937.95 --> 940.5790000000001
yeah

942.23 --> 945.71
don't get all

945.81 --> 950.3
all girly on me Chris that's alright

960.22 --> 964.34
sorry I had to do it but it's okay dude

963.23 --> 966.47
I get it

964.34 --> 971.15
you know everyone can make mistakes it's

966.47 --> 974.63
just that's the thing about it sometimes

971.15 --> 976.97
if you act out it might turn out you're

974.63 --> 981.02
mistaken so that's why it's best to just

976.97 --> 983.72
never do that yes my principle you could

981.02 --> 985.25
always however come fencing into may

983.72 --> 986.9300000000001
have looked at the time can always turn

985.25 --> 988.73
out to have been mistaken and then you

986.93 --> 993.14
just look like it asks no matter what

988.73 --> 996.0500000000001
and hey I even get that kind of crap I

993.14 --> 997.97
even do stupid anger moments that in

996.05 --> 1000.67
retrospect turn out to be pretty silly

997.97 --> 1004.0
and I try not to I try to be

1000.67 --> 1010.06
legitimately angry about real things

1004.0 --> 1012.99
that really matter but it's difficult to

1010.06 --> 1012.9899999999999
tell the difference sometimes

1026.76 --> 1035.189
Oh God come on guys don't start arguing

1032.429 --> 1038.7800000000002
about being banned in another chat in

1035.189 --> 1038.78
another hangouts in my chat

1049.44 --> 1055.6200000000001
ragnar Stefan held arson actually asks a

1053.04 --> 1057.8899999999999
very interesting neutral question let's

1055.62 --> 1061.05
get into that and not into this silly

1057.89 --> 1066.18
meta talk about chats in other hangouts

1061.05 --> 1076.28
please right can the earth be created in

1066.18 --> 1076.28
a sphere yes but

1076.9 --> 1085.51
in fear in what sense that's the deal

1081.43 --> 1088.3
here look said it before it's gonna

1085.51 --> 1092.17
sound really really weird the earth can

1088.3 --> 1097.3899999999999
be flat physically geometrically flat

1092.17 --> 1099.43
and the sphere at the same time but the

1097.39 --> 1103.71
sphere aspect it's not gonna be a

1099.43 --> 1109.1100000000001
physical literal aspect it's gonna be an

1103.71 --> 1113.38
interconnection special nonlinear wise

1109.11 --> 1114.9289999999999
sphere so the way the map natura the map

1113.38 --> 1118.24
of the flat surface naturally

1114.929 --> 1121.99
interconnects could be a sphere a total

1118.24 --> 1125.11
complete sphere which would be very very

1121.99 --> 1126.16
surreal and sadistically confusing to

1125.11 --> 1132.79
our very nature

1126.16 --> 1137.14
this can be set it day one my first

1132.79 --> 1139.6599999999999
hangout this is a possibility and it's

1137.14 --> 1141.76
too confusing it's too confusing to

1139.66 --> 1146.2900000000002
think about it for too long okay

1141.76 --> 1151.809
it could turn out to be but it can't be

1146.29 --> 1155.8
a physical literal sphere that's never

1151.809 --> 1158.16
gonna turn out to be what it is I am

1155.8 --> 1158.1599999999999
sorry

1168.05 --> 1175.28
I'm having a very sick personal threat

1171.41 --> 1177.95
of again about some freaky guy in Dutch

1175.28 --> 1181.1299999999999
and he says he's coming to my doorbell

1177.95 --> 1184.309
well you do that it's really interesting

1181.13 --> 1187.0400000000002
because you know there's this spot right

1184.309 --> 1189.17
over there where I can walk on the roof

1187.04 --> 1191.6
if you're gonna ring on that doorbell I

1189.17 --> 1194.3300000000002
can go there and actually can throw snow

1191.6 --> 1196.57
bells right down on your head so you go

1194.33 --> 1202.6
ahead and ring my doorbell

1196.57 --> 1202.6
dumb ass good luck with that

1209.37 --> 1213.2099999999998
nothing scared of you I'm not even

1211.23 --> 1220.83
scared of you if you were two metres

1213.21 --> 1225.1390000000001
tall okay not scared shitless now I've

1220.83 --> 1228.9189999999999
been prepared for Mad Men to assault me

1225.139 --> 1232.82
been preparing for that for half my life

1228.919 --> 1238.6200000000001
all right already

1232.82 --> 1246.869
I'm ready due to overexposure in my soul

1238.62 --> 1250.799
so don't worry about it Pia honey oh my

1246.869 --> 1252.629
god Randy that is just too much maybe I

1250.799 --> 1254.49
could do it make some yellow snowballs

1252.629 --> 1258.509
or something but no I'm not gonna pee

1254.49 --> 1262.919
off the roof that's that's some serious

1258.509 --> 1265.44
bad karma right there I'm known as Qaeda

1262.919 --> 1268.74
good mother civilized guy if I do that

1265.44 --> 1271.669
that's gonna be over forever new new

1268.74 --> 1271.669
let's not do that

1281.34 --> 1284.9399999999998
you guys are hilarious

1288.65 --> 1290.68
Oh

1296.57 --> 1300.829
and there's some Magpies over there that

1298.999 --> 1306.049
have been seriously territorial with

1300.829 --> 1308.709
each other must be affected by the

1306.049 --> 1308.709
winter as well

1313.21 --> 1315.93
come on

1316.48 --> 1321.27
yeah then they know it when I'm looking

1318.49 --> 1321.27
there than when I

1322.61 --> 1326.06
they don't want to be the match by Jerry

1325.37 --> 1329.11
Springer Show

1326.06 --> 1329.11
so they just left

1330.44 --> 1333.46
they're coming back

1338.31 --> 1345.51
creatures are so weird

1341.5 --> 1345.51
we underestimate their consciousness

1348.039 --> 1351.239
give them a gift

1376.38 --> 1384.1490000000001
lovebirds one thing I can't stem and

1381.37 --> 1388.0
it's kind of odd to even to me

1384.149 --> 1392.5189999999998
it's seagulls that's because seagulls

1388.0 --> 1395.38
are freakin enemies with all birds and

1392.519 --> 1397.69
way to offer confident and way to

1395.38 --> 1401.5900000000001
systematic and way to psionically

1397.69 --> 1403.48
talented and they don't give other

1401.59 --> 1407.1999999999998
creatures any room that just take

1403.48 --> 1409.45
everything total looter games and I

1407.2 --> 1418.75
don't like seagulls and I don't like the

1409.45 --> 1421.169
way they squeak sorry seagulls don't

1418.75 --> 1421.169
like you

1426.95 --> 1429.95
what

1433.5 --> 1438.75
yeah well seagulls don't really need

1435.69 --> 1442.5
taking care of you know like at all of

1438.75 --> 1445.02
ever like seriously just look at

1442.5 --> 1447.87
fisheries what's the first thing you see

1445.02 --> 1449.789
on land it's a bunch of freaking

1447.87 --> 1452.34
seagulls just trying to loot everything

1449.789 --> 1455.25
it's what they always it's always the

1452.34 --> 1458.07
seagulls okay always it's never how

1455.25 --> 1460.23
their types of birds were rarely usually

1458.07 --> 1464.6
just the freakin seagulls every single

1460.23 --> 1464.6
time they don't need feeding okay

1469.95 --> 1474.99
then I don't think they're demons either

1472.5 --> 1481.77
I just think they are extremely

1474.99 --> 1485.19
efficient and under pressure any type of

1481.77 --> 1488.16
pressure they thrive while others may

1485.19 --> 1494.19
suffer and that's just unbalanced you

1488.16 --> 1497.8500000000001
know I can imagine and I don't want to I

1494.19 --> 1500.1000000000001
don't like to imagine that even if like

1497.85 --> 1502.29
almost every bird type in the world

1500.1 --> 1504.99
would go extinct that the freaking

1502.29 --> 1508.56
seagulls will survive like it's the last

1504.99 --> 1510.06
freakin surviving animal or something as

1508.56 --> 1514.11
long as there's any type of fish

1510.06 --> 1519.99
anywhere I don't know maybe I'm all for

1514.11 --> 1522.9199999999998
blowing it they're so tenacious

1519.99 --> 1525.66
like other dirt other birds you know

1522.92 --> 1529.89
they scare away pretty easily like try

1525.66 --> 1531.9
to scare away seagulls you know they're

1529.89 --> 1534.5400000000002
just one step away from actually

1531.9 --> 1536.97
attacking you back like screw you this

1534.54 --> 1539.82
is this is ours like I know you're a

1536.97 --> 1542.0
freakin human they don't do that but

1539.82 --> 1545.81
this like one step away from that

1542.0 --> 1545.81
they're almost that

1549.11 --> 1552.2489999999998
that confident

1552.72 --> 1559.14
but not just yet

1555.48 --> 1559.14
anyway birds

1562.75 --> 1565.83
yeah but I have to

1567.01 --> 1574.299
but yeah every time I want to feed the

1570.37 --> 1578.52
Magpies and other smaller birds and

1574.299 --> 1580.84
crows they're just a couple of them

1578.52 --> 1581.26
sometimes yeah when I throw stuff out

1580.84 --> 1583.3899999999999
there

1581.26 --> 1585.46
then the sequel's come and I have to

1583.39 --> 1587.95
just get rid of them or it's gonna be

1585.46 --> 1589.96
instantly gone and the yeah the birthday

1587.95 --> 1594.64
I actually want to feed won't have had a

1589.96 --> 1598.179
snippet of it so I see you see us as a

1594.64 --> 1604.63
menace like much more so than pigeons

1598.179 --> 1608.049
even because pigeons tend to just hang

1604.63 --> 1611.44
around places where there is food

1608.049 --> 1615.1
regularly dumps that's what pigeons do

1611.44 --> 1617.919
that seagulls go scurrying all over the

1615.1 --> 1619.78
place like gangs and wherever something

1617.919 --> 1623.19
pops up they just loot it instantly

1619.78 --> 1623.19
that's what they constantly do

1638.12 --> 1642.6999999999998
hey hello Chris they are

1644.27 --> 1660.94
you can you hear me yes I can can you

1649.76 --> 1665.69
hear me I do talking about birds oh yeah

1660.94 --> 1667.8500000000001
apparently yes I got about 20 minutes

1665.69 --> 1672.2
then I got a beat up on a work call but

1667.85 --> 1674.02
uh I saw you live you know second day in

1672.2 --> 1677.15
a row I'm working from home so I have

1674.02 --> 1680.45
had the opportunity to just walk on

1677.15 --> 1686.9
perfume it say hi and see what you're

1680.45 --> 1690.14
talking about here birds and their

1686.9 --> 1691.7
parent B says I had a pitch I had pigeon

1690.14 --> 1693.89
swarms around me while I was eating

1691.7 --> 1696.77
lunch and I had to hit them to get them

1693.89 --> 1699.98
off but that's like big cities of things

1696.77 --> 1703.91
that's where they swarm around and yeah

1699.98 --> 1706.76
they get really really cocky pigeons I

1703.91 --> 1707.6000000000001
guess even much more so than than

1706.76 --> 1710.6299999999999
seagulls

1707.6 --> 1714.55
but yes seagulls go everywhere they also

1710.63 --> 1717.23
robbed from the the cute little birdies

1714.55 --> 1718.97
pigeons just hang around the places

1717.23 --> 1726.85
where foods dumped and then they hit

1718.97 --> 1730.49
they mob you yeah makes you so censors

1726.85 --> 1732.86
speaking of birds this is gonna sound

1730.49 --> 1739.19
strange but do you believe in macro

1732.86 --> 1742.9699999999998
evolution no absolutely okay me neither

1739.19 --> 1746.45
I used to when I was free Flat Earth and

1742.97 --> 1748.25
I was an atheist but uh yeah I don't

1746.45 --> 1749.63
hurt you know I looked after flat earth

1748.25 --> 1753.32
I started looking into more into

1749.63 --> 1756.98
evolution and evolution versus creation

1753.32 --> 1759.3799999999999
and things like that and I just have I

1756.98 --> 1761.51
just have to say that I'm more of a

1759.38 --> 1762.91
creationist now this really sort of

1761.51 --> 1765.65
strange review just to say that because

1762.91 --> 1769.98
why my whole life I would said I wasn't

1765.65 --> 1772.0800000000002
but I have why I said it

1769.98 --> 1775.5
is it really that strange have you

1772.08 --> 1778.62
tested it because I went through that

1775.5 --> 1781.86
process I even before Flat Earth I was

1778.62 --> 1783.6499999999999
into creationism I was fascinated by the

1781.86 --> 1787.26
things that have bumped into the

1783.65 --> 1790.919
polonium rings in granite and all that

1787.26 --> 1793.11
and just yeah the misleading concept of

1790.919 --> 1797.3600000000001
fossils and how their age is supposedly

1793.11 --> 1800.7299999999998
measured it's just ridiculous and yeah

1797.36 --> 1802.6499999999999
right I figured the creationist and made

1800.73 --> 1804.45
a lot more sense and I didn't draw

1802.65 --> 1807.5700000000002
conclusions like oh yeah in the

1804.45 --> 1809.82
beginning or I at first thought yeah

1807.57 --> 1811.86
aliens of course of course

1809.82 --> 1814.83
aliens came down from another planet and

1811.86 --> 1817.86
created us of course makes all the makes

1814.83 --> 1821.25
sense at least the creation part made

1817.86 --> 1823.11
sense see so that's how that started

1821.25 --> 1828.419
and then yeah it became a little bit

1823.11 --> 1831.84
more complicated right but well I also

1828.419 --> 1835.5590000000002
came across some non Flat Earth creation

1831.84 --> 1838.1399999999999
scientists like a guy named um spike

1835.559 --> 1840.84
casares he's got a lot of videos on

1838.14 --> 1843.48
YouTube he's got a a creation website

1840.84 --> 1847.02
and he used to work I want to say he

1843.48 --> 1851.46
used to work for NASA and he said during

1847.02 --> 1853.23
his time there he converted to a

1851.46 --> 1856.71
creationist right so he basically said

1853.23 --> 1858.179
in his time and becoming scientists and

1856.71 --> 1859.8600000000001
looking at all these things he he

1858.179 --> 1861.5400000000002
converted to creationism from atheism

1859.86 --> 1863.76
but you know some of the stuff he talks

1861.54 --> 1865.98
about is things like you know the way

1863.76 --> 1869.19
they say that the planets and all the

1865.98 --> 1871.59
all the solid bodies formed in space is

1869.19 --> 1874.38
you know you had first you had nothing

1871.59 --> 1877.23
okay yeah then he had every everything

1874.38 --> 1878.22
out of potential big thing right and

1877.23 --> 1880.65
he's like where did that come from

1878.22 --> 1882.38
there's no explanation and then he and

1880.65 --> 1885.929
then after that you had sort of this

1882.38 --> 1888.0900000000001
swarm of gas gas and and mop particles

1885.929 --> 1890.7
and molecules and then from there you

1888.09 --> 1894.12
you them to decent rock bodies known as

1890.7 --> 1895.8300000000002
planets and and meteors and things and

1894.12 --> 1898.32
he says their explanation for that makes

1895.83 --> 1900.33
no sense basically if you take if you

1898.32 --> 1902.4289999999999
take pebbles and you can take grains of

1900.33 --> 1903.87
sand and smash them together they'll

1902.429 --> 1905.669
form a chunk of rock

1903.87 --> 1907.08
and if you take to those big chunks of

1905.669 --> 1911.789
rock and smash them together they

1907.08 --> 1913.6499999999999
planets no and it nobody doesn't let me

1911.789 --> 1917.46
get even deeper into that it's a good

1913.65 --> 1919.6200000000001
subject but yeah gravity will do that

1917.46 --> 1921.8400000000001
but the thing is there's more than just

1919.62 --> 1924.4799999999998
gravity and that's something that the

1921.84 --> 1927.32
heliocentric tend to overlook because

1924.48 --> 1929.88
yeah if it's gonna be a gas out there

1927.32 --> 1932.1
it's also gonna want to expand and

1929.88 --> 1937.0800000000002
dilute it's actually not gonna be drawn

1932.1 --> 1939.6589999999999
together because because it's not that

1937.08 --> 1941.9089999999999
it's not solid enough to actually get a

1939.659 --> 1944.5390000000002
gravitational pull so how could that

1941.909 --> 1948.929
ever manifest right

1944.539 --> 1952.559
it can't paradox within the design

1948.929 --> 1956.549
itself well it's it's yeah exactly it's

1952.559 --> 1959.6399999999999
a catch-22 there

1956.549 --> 1962.6689999999999
did you know if gravity was necessary to

1959.64 --> 1964.5
form planets and things well but there

1962.669 --> 1970.3200000000002
was no gravity because there was no mass

1964.5 --> 1972.48
so what came first when they need yeah

1970.32 --> 1975.799
gravity to make the planets but they

1972.48 --> 1979.47
need the planets to make the gravity

1975.799 --> 1981.24
right okay so anyways yeah that was you

1979.47 --> 1982.6490000000001
know that was sort of where I started I

1981.24 --> 1984.33
mean I start with flattered but just

1982.649 --> 1987.57
blew my mind of course like most people

1984.33 --> 1989.49
but then I got into thinking well if

1987.57 --> 1992.6399999999999
Flat Earth is real then what you know

1989.49 --> 1996.0
how how is the earth only six to ten

1992.64 --> 1997.5
thousand years old how how you know some

1996.0 --> 1999.75
of these other way how is evolution

1997.5 --> 2001.76
untrue you know what what are the other

1999.75 --> 2003.169
you know other side saying and that's

2001.76 --> 2005.559
when I started looking at the creation

2003.169 --> 2008.0590000000002
side and a guy named Steven Steven Meyer

2005.559 --> 2011.3899999999999
who works further I think is at the

2008.059 --> 2012.559
Creation Institute or something and he's

2011.39 --> 2014.929
got a lot of good stuff you know he

2012.559 --> 2018.5
talks about DNA you know being computer

2014.929 --> 2020.72
code and that it you know that type of

2018.5 --> 2022.19
sequence those four just four simple

2020.72 --> 2024.59
letters and but they're in a very

2022.19 --> 2026.96
specific and special sequence would

2024.59 --> 2031.4599999999998
never be able to be produced out of

2026.96 --> 2032.56
natural random occurrence yes that's the

2031.46 --> 2036.3500000000001
design

2032.56 --> 2038.54
it can't gradually evolve the concept

2036.35 --> 2042.32
that these things gradually involved

2038.54 --> 2044.4099999999999
from mutation that part is fundamentally

2042.32 --> 2048.5
flawed from every angle

2044.41 --> 2053.84
because mutation is deviation is leads

2048.5 --> 2056.72
to destruction right over the gap in an

2053.84 --> 2060.08
individual like a mutation may be some

2056.72 --> 2063.9089999999997
kind of freak thing that yeah give you

2060.08 --> 2068.21
something special but in the actual

2063.909 --> 2071.179
reproduction cycle no it it always

2068.21 --> 2074.75
degrades things and makes reproduction

2071.179 --> 2078.98
harder right there is a framework within

2074.75 --> 2083.629
which a species can migrate it's like

2078.98 --> 2086.149
you had the most central genotype of one

2083.629 --> 2088.61
species at the center and then there's

2086.149 --> 2091.04
all the different types that they can

2088.61 --> 2092.69
become from within that gene spectrum

2091.04 --> 2094.639
and the further they go to the outside

2092.69 --> 2096.83
ring the more extreme they become and

2094.639 --> 2099.26
the more fertility problems they come

2096.83 --> 2101.99
against and when they go too far outside

2099.26 --> 2105.05
then they just die they don't reproduce

2101.99 --> 2110.5099999999998
anymore and that seems to be the case

2105.05 --> 2112.7000000000003
with every species right yeah and and so

2110.51 --> 2114.86
Reapers reproduction for me is something

2112.7 --> 2117.23
I've I've never been able to understand

2114.86 --> 2119.8700000000003
even when I was into evolution and that

2117.23 --> 2121.58
is just just forget all this all the

2119.87 --> 2123.92
other species let's look at humans right

2121.58 --> 2126.65
so they say at some point millions of

2123.92 --> 2129.9500000000003
years ago we were the same blob of

2126.65 --> 2132.83
material right the same proto material

2129.95 --> 2136.1
or whatever in cells and then at some

2132.83 --> 2138.86
point we we spend we took a turn look

2136.1 --> 2140.42
let's just say myth in the male species

2138.86 --> 2142.25
took a turn to the left and the female

2140.42 --> 2146.11
species took a turn right and then

2142.25 --> 2148.55
somehow perfectly we formed the male

2146.11 --> 2150.9500000000003
genitalia and women formed the female

2148.55 --> 2154.63
genitalia to perfectly fit together do

2150.95 --> 2159.8599999999997
perfectly one has firm one has the a and

2154.63 --> 2163.94
to create another he quote-unquote human

2159.86 --> 2165.6800000000003
life that to me is absolutely absurd and

2163.94 --> 2167.81
impossible and it makes no sense

2165.68 --> 2170.8999999999996
random welcome to how can random

2167.81 --> 2172.52
processes create a perfectly fitted male

2170.9 --> 2177.4700000000003
genitalia with the perfectly fitted

2172.52 --> 2178.88
female genitalia to then produce life it

2177.47 --> 2181.73
just doesn't make any sense I feel

2178.88 --> 2186.34
stupid even having that well that's the

2181.73 --> 2190.72
weird thing about the grow and unfolding

2186.34 --> 2190.7200000000003
development process of life so

2193.0 --> 2198.43
yeah that that is the harder to argue

2195.64 --> 2200.95
part that yeah when can imagine

2198.43 --> 2203.9199999999996
transition stages like another

2200.95 --> 2207.33
reproduction type you know there's so

2203.92 --> 2210.58
many types these eggs and the wombs and

2207.33 --> 2213.0099999999998
and yeah one could imagine that they

2210.58 --> 2218.02
would potentially transit their alike

2213.01 --> 2220.96
but just how do you tell and where are

2218.02 --> 2223.21
the transitions because every look the

2220.96 --> 2225.01
thing about evolution is that they that

2223.21 --> 2227.56
they assume that there's always a

2225.01 --> 2230.44
transition between one phase and the

2227.56 --> 2233.0499999999997
other but they can never demonstrate

2230.44 --> 2235.33
that transition and when they try they

2233.05 --> 2238.15
always come up with some weird freaky

2235.33 --> 2240.7599999999998
mutation that died after they being born

2238.15 --> 2246.67
kind of thing you know right that's

2240.76 --> 2253.8
always what they tries like oh no it's

2246.67 --> 2253.8
just alike but not the same it's not

2253.83 --> 2259.39
right if macro evolution is real is true

2257.619 --> 2263.2000000000003
and real and somehow they can they could

2259.39 --> 2265.54
ever prove it the only way we can get to

2263.2 --> 2268.18
where we are today with with multiple

2265.54 --> 2271.5099999999998
sexes and multiple sex organs that

2268.18 --> 2274.72
coexist it would have to have been a

2271.51 --> 2276.28
directed process it's it's not possible

2274.72 --> 2278.3199999999997
for it to have been an undirected

2276.28 --> 2280.3900000000003
process you see it would have had to

2278.32 --> 2282.73
have been planned even if you said it

2280.39 --> 2285.7599999999998
took millions of years to do that the

2282.73 --> 2287.47
fact that we have DNA and the DNA tells

2285.76 --> 2288.76
us what's build and how to build and

2287.47 --> 2291.73
what we look like and how we turn out

2288.76 --> 2293.8590000000004
and to say you know you get female sex

2291.73 --> 2296.14
organ you get male sex organ oh and by

2293.859 --> 2299.74
the way they work perfectly together to

2296.14 --> 2301.5989999999997
create another human person that would

2299.74 --> 2303.3689999999997
have had to have been a direct process

2301.599 --> 2305.23
it's not made it's not random and a

2303.369 --> 2311.28
random mutation out of nothing

2305.23 --> 2315.66
that's ridiculous well how could it

2311.28 --> 2318.9
again how can it transit how is where's

2315.66 --> 2323.75
the transition from one format one

2318.9 --> 2330.11
method into the other it's not there

2323.75 --> 2334.53
it's comparing apples to paracin and

2330.11 --> 2337.05
arguing how a pair gradually turned into

2334.53 --> 2343.11
an apple basically right

2337.05 --> 2345.36
no I'm yeah I'm not saying I believe it

2343.11 --> 2348.09
I'm just saying if it were by a small

2345.36 --> 2349.83
chance true it would have had to have

2348.09 --> 2351.9300000000003
been a directive process but I don't

2349.83 --> 2354.9
think it was it's like you said the

2351.93 --> 2357.3599999999997
transitional you know I asked people

2354.9 --> 2362.2200000000003
like well the transition from a full

2357.36 --> 2365.1
fish or a full amphibious creature to a

2362.22 --> 2367.3199999999997
full land creature like what the hell

2365.1 --> 2369.2999999999997
are you talking about how on earth did

2367.32 --> 2373.23
that happen right where is the species

2369.3 --> 2375.96
that had two legs but a back fin you

2373.23 --> 2378.66
know it just doesn't exist or it had a

2375.96 --> 2380.52
half had one lung and it had one Gill

2378.66 --> 2382.35
right it just doesn't make any sense how

2380.52 --> 2385.23
would you go from full from two lungs

2382.35 --> 2387.9
and living in water to two lungs living

2385.23 --> 2389.52
on Muskies me to guilt to gills living

2387.9 --> 2391.62
water to two lungs living on weight yeah

2389.52 --> 2393.72
everything makes sense does the freaky

2391.62 --> 2395.7599999999998
thing about that is and now I'm almost

2393.72 --> 2398.5499999999997
going to the other side no not really

2395.76 --> 2401.46
is yeah there are a lot of creatures

2398.55 --> 2407.4300000000003
that are in transit position really

2401.46 --> 2410.64
there are amphibians that live like in

2407.43 --> 2412.95
water but also on land and there are

2410.64 --> 2415.98
snakes and all that but the thing again

2412.95 --> 2418.3799999999997
it's like yeah if yeah but they're

2415.98 --> 2421.07
answered things in between then that

2418.38 --> 2424.92
could work but they're not there's just

2421.07 --> 2427.77
different types of creature on almost

2424.92 --> 2430.7400000000002
everywhere but there's still no no real

2427.77 --> 2433.27
transit right LLL not

2430.74 --> 2437.02
but yeah so many things are

2433.27 --> 2439.33
that live on land and in the sea that do

2437.02 --> 2442.93
have their lungfish okay they're

2439.33 --> 2445.5099999999998
freaking lungfish itchy

2442.93 --> 2450.0099999999998
yes my argument my argument would be

2445.51 --> 2452.4100000000003
those things are there now right so so

2450.01 --> 2456.19
to me those didn't evolve from an on one

2452.41 --> 2459.0099999999998
fish they've always been one fish so so

2456.19 --> 2461.53
the DNA the DNA in that one fish for

2459.01 --> 2464.17
example since you used it the DNA says

2461.53 --> 2466.75
you get a lung and you get a gill or

2464.17 --> 2468.55
whatever the structure is it just

2466.75 --> 2471.46
otherwise it doesn't make sense to have

2468.55 --> 2475.63
started out one and ended up another all

2471.46 --> 2478.6
right yeah the DNA was pre-programmed in

2475.63 --> 2483.46
other words in my opinion yeah you can't

2478.6 --> 2487.99
just well it would almost be like

2483.46 --> 2489.94
imagine it's like this in theory this is

2487.99 --> 2496.1499999999996
gonna sound really weird but think about

2489.94 --> 2498.73
it you're like a human or whatever

2496.15 --> 2503.14
something that lives very long and you

2498.73 --> 2505.51
breathe fish okay and as an experiment

2503.14 --> 2507.2799999999997
over the generations or maybe you're

2505.51 --> 2510.4300000000003
being the list for a thousand years or

2507.28 --> 2513.4
whatever you are gonna take these fish

2510.43 --> 2517.54
every time pick them up out of the water

2513.4 --> 2519.73
and almost let them choke and then put

2517.54 --> 2521.89
them back again and sometimes some may

2519.73 --> 2523.95
choke it sounds very sadistic at first

2521.89 --> 2526.8399999999997
but what if you're doing this to

2523.95 --> 2530.2599999999998
stimulate the evolution for them to

2526.84 --> 2533.6200000000003
adapt to the air would that work what

2530.26 --> 2538.21
they at some point become more able to

2533.62 --> 2540.6099999999997
withstand low oxygen or yeah not holding

2538.21 --> 2544.48
their breath out of water better you

2540.61 --> 2548.53
know it's a weird idea but the evolution

2544.48 --> 2549.67
suggests it does work like that that

2548.53 --> 2552.8500000000004
that would happen

2549.67 --> 2554.26
well they that's evolution suggesting

2552.85 --> 2557.14
that but I don't again I don't think

2554.26 --> 2559.63
that would happen so think of think of

2557.14 --> 2562.69
this so you're a way to find out

2559.63 --> 2563.71
wait a million years so you're a seer

2562.69 --> 2564.4900000000002
[ __ ] do it

2563.71 --> 2567.01
do it over

2564.49 --> 2571.33
yeah hello family are weird here let's

2567.01 --> 2572.8300000000004
say they are at 30,000 years right well

2571.33 --> 2575.23
say you're a fish 30 million years ago

2572.83 --> 2577.39
right and you're you're swimming and

2575.23 --> 2581.23
you're fast and your your quote/unquote

2577.39 --> 2583.99
designed for the water right so you've

2581.23 --> 2585.7
got if you've got gills too for

2583.99 --> 2587.9799999999996
breathing and going through the water

2585.7 --> 2589.359
you've got fit fast fins to make you

2587.98 --> 2592.66
swerve and miss predator

2589.359 --> 2594.79
all of a sudden five million years later

2592.66 --> 2597.7
you're you're evolving right to become a

2594.79 --> 2599.109
land creature as well you're now slow

2597.7 --> 2600.91
because you've got these like legs

2599.109 --> 2604.48
protruding from your sides of your body

2600.91 --> 2606.31
and you're you can't turn his bass and

2604.48 --> 2610.06
you're sort of coming out on the land

2606.31 --> 2612.82
somehow but you somehow have evolved

2610.06 --> 2615.04
partial lungs but you know they're not

2612.82 --> 2618.6400000000003
quite they're not quite there yet it's

2615.04 --> 2620.2799999999997
where the lungs right your fear your

2618.64 --> 2622.42
bloated because you've got these like

2620.28 --> 2623.8300000000004
stubby legs sticking out that haven't

2622.42 --> 2626.58
fully formed but you're still in the

2623.83 --> 2626.58
water now right

2626.74 --> 2630.9399999999996
how would these lungs come into

2628.63 --> 2633.9100000000003
existence gradually would there be like

2630.94 --> 2636.04
an opening that is just in the body like

2633.91 --> 2638.17
a crevasse that would be exposed to air

2636.04 --> 2640.54
accidentally and then over the

2638.17 --> 2643.599
generation lung tissue would gradually

2640.54 --> 2645.2799999999997
start to form there so how the freaking

2643.599 --> 2647.38
hell good I mean you whippin an ax

2645.28 --> 2649.42
she would have to have a thousand

2647.38 --> 2651.73
transitional species going from a non

2649.42 --> 2653.7400000000002
lung creature to a lung creature from a

2651.73 --> 2656.349
guild water creature to a lung flame

2653.74 --> 2658.089
creature a thousand or more transitional

2656.349 --> 2660.1600000000003
species right because every every

2658.089 --> 2662.7999999999997
million years you're going to have more

2660.16 --> 2664.81
of a produced lung and more of a

2662.8 --> 2668.29
produced leg and less than a produced

2664.81 --> 2672.45
fin and less of a produced tail right or

2668.29 --> 2672.45
whatever it just doesn't make any sense

2673.47 --> 2678.93
well theoretically it could make sense

2676.45 --> 2681.04
but the problem is there are no

2678.93 --> 2683.08
transitions there is no proof of these

2681.04 --> 2685.5099999999998
transitions

2683.08 --> 2687.61
because every time as a transitional

2685.51 --> 2690.5200000000004
thing is suggested then when they do

2687.61 --> 2694.27
actual genetic research usually it's

2690.52 --> 2696.72
like new it's not even close they don't

2694.27 --> 2696.72
talk about that

2699.0 --> 2710.32
not sorry it's just not it's not it's

2704.56 --> 2712.72
another genetic transition yeah well I

2710.32 --> 2716.0800000000004
love the you know the argument oh well

2712.72 --> 2720.2799999999997
our DNA is 96% the same as chimps and

2716.08 --> 2722.35
it's like well okay maybe but uh you

2720.28 --> 2724.03
know if you were to use one of Stephen

2722.35 --> 2726.58
mock Steve Myers arguments if you're a

2724.03 --> 2729.28
programmer and your language your coding

2726.58 --> 2731.92
language is DNA you know do you rewrite

2729.28 --> 2734.1400000000003
the whole language and program or do you

2731.92 --> 2736.84
reuse the code well if you've ever been

2734.14 --> 2738.2799999999997
a developer which I have a little bit

2736.84 --> 2739.7200000000003
open I wouldn't call myself a developer

2738.28 --> 2743.02
but maybe you what's called a script er

2739.72 --> 2746.29
yes you reuse blocks of code all the

2743.02 --> 2747.7
time scripts you yeah you cut and paste

2746.29 --> 2749.29
things and you put them in here

2747.7 --> 2751.3599999999997
that's what functions are right

2749.29 --> 2755.23
functions are you write a block of code

2751.36 --> 2759.01
well you know you as a scripture or a

2755.23 --> 2760.48
script kitty as they call it you need to

2759.01 --> 2762.67
know what to copy

2760.48 --> 2765.01
you need to have sources of material

2762.67 --> 2767.44
that you can copy/paste and create

2765.01 --> 2769.96
things with like you would create things

2767.44 --> 2774.87
with Lego except this is code and it

2769.96 --> 2775.9900000000002
actually produces Internet content right

2774.87 --> 2781.0899999999997
exactly

2775.99 --> 2783.25
I understand how it works very good yeah

2781.09 --> 2785.56
so I mean so he was so for anyone who's

2783.25 --> 2788.86
questioning I have to go in a minute but

2785.56 --> 2792.2799999999997
uh Stephen C Meyer YouTube him another

2788.86 --> 2794.92
guy named Spike a Soros YouTube him he's

2792.28 --> 2796.21
good he's the X I think he's like X NASA

2794.92 --> 2799.63
or something like that I don't remember

2796.21 --> 2803.26
cause NASA or JPL or some one of those

2799.63 --> 2804.6400000000003
big rocket companies but uh he's a good

2803.26 --> 2806.71
they're both night no non flat-earthers

2804.64 --> 2808.15
but they're both creation creationist

2806.71 --> 2811.14
science creationist if you want to call

2808.15 --> 2813.23
it that so they're really interesting

2811.14 --> 2815.97
what else

2813.23 --> 2817.7400000000002
that's that's all I've got today so I

2815.97 --> 2818.97
wish I could stay longer I have a call

2817.74 --> 2821.1
on three minutes I gotta get ready for

2818.97 --> 2824.22
us right hey thanks for being here it

2821.1 --> 2826.35
said yeah the good subject yeah I can't

2824.22 --> 2827.97
I usually I usually go to work this

2826.35 --> 2830.1
early but I'm working home again today

2827.97 --> 2831.6
so I was able to call him for a little

2830.1 --> 2833.3399999999997
bit all right

2831.6 --> 2837.41
well thanks for being here man all right

2833.34 --> 2837.4100000000003
iron see you later later

2840.2 --> 2847.54
yeah it was interesting evolution how

2845.0 --> 2847.54
weird is that

2851.24 --> 2857.93
it's such a nice fairytale it's so

2854.03 --> 2860.7200000000003
interesting and also there's this thing

2857.93 --> 2864.71
there's this weird little thing about it

2860.72 --> 2869.98
okay there's an appeal to evolution and

2864.71 --> 2872.51
that is that look if the human could

2869.98 --> 2874.849
originally spring forth from a

2872.51 --> 2878.42
one-celled being then that means that

2874.849 --> 2883.6090000000004
our potential could be endless like what

2878.42 --> 2886.19
can we evolve into that's another dream

2883.609 --> 2888.14
a grandiose dream that can spawn from

2886.19 --> 2891.19
that and probably a lot of people use as

2888.14 --> 2893.0
an inspiration to be very listen

2891.19 --> 2896.27
megalomaniacal

2893.0 --> 2898.7
probably so that's another aspect to it

2896.27 --> 2905.03
well yeah if you're just created then

2898.7 --> 2908.6899999999996
and there is a limit then that will make

2905.03 --> 2912.1400000000003
you more down to earth about it and just

2908.69 --> 2914.96
think what am i what am I supposed to do

2912.14 --> 2917.54
according to the design according to the

2914.96 --> 2921.8
Creator the path what is the path for

2917.54 --> 2926.3
this being if that becomes more natural

2921.8 --> 2930.44
that approaches you more natural if you

2926.3 --> 2932.1800000000003
look at creation instead of evolution or

2930.44 --> 2934.31
with evolution the potentials are

2932.18 --> 2937.6699999999996
infinite but just manipulate all over

2934.31 --> 2943.839
the place and oh my god we could be gods

2937.67 --> 2949.0
blue that [ __ ] you know all comes with

2943.839 --> 2949.0
with evolution theory

2971.4 --> 2974.7490000000003
okay I'm gonna

2977.28 --> 2982.5400000000004
entertain somebody

2980.65 --> 2986.17
yeah we got a few more minutes at least

2982.54 --> 2988.66
so let's see it's gonna be annoying and

2986.17 --> 2994.51

something Haupt pastries yeah I was

3509.05 --> 3515.02
freshly made still warm and everything

3510.99 --> 3517.12
for this address but not there it was a

3515.02 --> 3519.91
telephone number that was obviously not

3517.12 --> 3522.3399999999997
mine and I'm on the only one home and

3519.91 --> 3526.1499999999996

3522.34 --> 3529.0
but that's over there and it's not the

3526.15 --> 3530.89
same street name so there's been a

3529.0 --> 3533.14
marital somebody just screwed up the

3530.89 --> 3535.5699999999997
address of granthi yeah somebody got

3560.02 --> 3566.56

3563.04 --> 3568.99
well be five minutes out of my show I

3566.56 --> 3571.42
think I would have inquired what kind of

3568.99 --> 3573.7
pastries they were and if I liked them I

3571.42 --> 3575.8
would have took them yeah well I still

3573.7 --> 3578.0499999999997
would have to pay for them so and I

3575.8 --> 3581.02
don't have that well you both wasn't

3578.05 --> 3582.61
organic anyways a penis cloaks just give

3581.02 --> 3586.12
you $2.99 yeah I noticed

3582.61 --> 3590.17
thanks for that not sure how many

3586.12 --> 3595.08
pastries that buys in Utrecht well from

3590.17 --> 3595.08
the register thing

3595.72 --> 3603.23
the publish new rice tag it was like

3599.8 --> 3606.98
probably 20 or 30 euros or something so

3603.23 --> 3610.66
in their bread it was a whole it was not

3606.98 --> 3611.96
a bread it was a package full with stuff

3610.66 --> 3614.72
whoa

3611.96 --> 3620.45
yeah so somebody just ordered it and got

3614.72 --> 3623.81
the wrong address to jinan the super

3620.45 --> 3628.0099999999998
cache stuff do um yeah yes yeah do you

3623.81 --> 3630.2
do you to take 40% of that Olli I so I

3628.01 --> 3632.98
hear Wow

3630.2 --> 3635.2999999999997
that's also be Cowan I don't seem fair

3632.98 --> 3639.23
it's their platform it's their

3635.3 --> 3641.6600000000003
prerogative and hey if they got some

3639.23 --> 3643.4900000000002
serious good competition and they do out

3641.66 --> 3645.47
there there are other systems other

3643.49 --> 3648.7099999999996
media platforms that do it very

3645.47 --> 3651.5
differently then there yeah they will

3648.71 --> 3656.2400000000002
eventually they must adapt or die

3651.5 --> 3660.5
because it becomes no longer viable so

3656.24 --> 3665.39
dare they do it how they do it and yeah

3660.5 --> 3669.41
it's not my my most preferred the method

3665.39 --> 3672.35
of but yeah I prefer the PayPal you get

3669.41 --> 3672.91
a hundred percent but yeah anything is

3672.35 --> 3676.46
welcome

3672.91 --> 3681.1299999999997

3694.91 --> 3700.7
& 8 hours a day playing games but just

3698.87 --> 3705.5
think about it it's crazy

3700.7 --> 3709.64
what a weird world now that people they

3705.5 --> 3713.849
don't pay to play games and how they pay

3709.64 --> 3717.96
to watch other people play a game

3713.849 --> 3719.67
I guess it's to learn to learn but

3717.96 --> 3722.009
you're not doing anything the whole

3719.67 --> 3726.2400000000002
point about games is learning the game

3722.009 --> 3729.9
if you play it's so weird it's so meta

3726.24 --> 3733.6189999999997
and why do people enjoy that it's I do

3729.9 --> 3736.6800000000003
enjoy like watching that stuff too

3733.619 --> 3739.0190000000002
sometimes a bit but that people would

3736.68 --> 3743.49
actually pay to just keep on watching it

3739.019 --> 3746.45
on anything yeah

3743.49 --> 3748.819

calling companies to deliver to this

3914.049 --> 3920.17
address

3914.88 --> 3924.46
Wow it's not funny who'd do that I don't

3920.17 --> 3927.7000000000003
know they're probably finding out well

3924.46 --> 3928.93
surely they have to give a number a

3927.7 --> 3931.569
phone number

3928.93 --> 3935.3689999999997
[ __ ] trace well did good call back yeah

3935.369 --> 3941.38
you know fake number whatever

3938.5 --> 3943.569
hey somebody this jealous that you'd go

3941.38 --> 3946.21

3943.569 --> 3948.549
maybe somebody who's just a total

3946.21 --> 3951.94
freaking dick and just can't stand me

3948.549 --> 3954.849
then I am what I am and so blatantly

3951.94 --> 3957.13
open about it and he wants to make my

3954.849 --> 3960.9900000000002
life miserable and he's staving for a

3957.13 --> 3970.3
confrontation which he will lose

3960.99 --> 3972.5499999999997
so good luck here hmm shame such a waste

3970.3 --> 3974.86
of energy yeah it's more than that like

3972.55 --> 3977.4100000000003
look this guy thinks that because he has

3974.86 --> 3980.8900000000003
these trickery systems around him that

3977.41 --> 3982.0299999999997
he's anonymous of something for you some

3980.89 --> 3983.98
bad news

3982.03 --> 3987.6400000000003
rather good news when you really think

3983.98 --> 3992.91
about it that is you're not anonymous ok

3987.64 --> 3997.06
I got a healer great great senses and we

3992.91 --> 3999.49
figure out who people are without ever

3997.06 --> 4002.21
having any trace of them just by the

3999.49 --> 4007.47
their essence being part of what is done

4002.21 --> 4010.41
so we will find you and we will touch

4007.47 --> 4012.66
you mmm if you've talked about your

4010.41 --> 4016.83
healer before is that some did the

4012.66 --> 4020.04
contact comes going cool no and nobody's

4016.83 --> 4021.75
business how I contact him I've known

4020.04 --> 4025.08
him for a long time longer than I've

4021.75 --> 4032.01
been on this scene and it's also

4025.08 --> 4035.0099999999998
colleague of my father okay

4032.01 --> 4038.88
he's been doing what he does for 50

4035.01 --> 4041.76
years so 50 years what does it do does

4038.88 --> 4044.42
he just talk to you lay on hands what

4041.76 --> 4049.2000000000003
kind of stuff why he doesn't need to

4044.42 --> 4051.48
right okay I can't do anything just he

4049.2 --> 4053.3999999999996
works on the other side and he does it

4051.48 --> 4055.68
perfectly and he has the full assistance

4053.4 --> 4057.9900000000002
and guidance of the angels which

4055.68 --> 4058.56
blatantly obvious when you actually deal

4057.99 --> 4062.52
with him

4058.56 --> 4066.45
he knows things instantly he is a master

4062.52 --> 4070.65
like I am kind of in my own way trying

4066.45 --> 4072.72
to become like him because he does so

4070.65 --> 4074.589
much good and he saved me so many times

4072.72 --> 4077.769
from dark influences

4074.589 --> 4082.769
he made me understand all their self I'm

4077.769 --> 4086.3489999999997
learning from him and he trusts me

4082.769 --> 4088.7189999999996
thorough guides me on the path so that's

4086.349 --> 4093.849
a somebody that you you kinda trucks

4088.719 --> 4096.4890000000005
really well yes that's good that you've

4093.849 --> 4098.849
got somebody like oh I got more people

4096.489 --> 4098.848999999999
like that

4102.31 --> 4109.18
that's good I'm fun I'm glad I think we

4107.62 --> 4112.0599999999995
could all do with somebody that we can

4109.18 --> 4117.75
ultimately trust that we can say

4112.06 --> 4117.75
anything to yeah that's a good thing I

4118.77 --> 4125.950000000001
know yeah he constantly also yeah refers

4123.279 --> 4128.650000000001
to the battle between light and darkness

4125.95 --> 4132.58
and this kind of [ __ ] is typical it's

4128.65 --> 4134.83
what's gonna happen the more you shine

4132.58 --> 4138.25
truth in those holes of consciousness

4134.83 --> 4141.16
that is random in common they're common

4138.25 --> 4144.04
people right now in the world bit more

4141.16 --> 4147.15
the demons will spring forth from those

4144.04 --> 4149.65
holes and start to wreak havoc in

4147.15 --> 4154.66
compulsively compulsively bully

4149.65 --> 4157.929999999999
compulsively attack do anything to get

4154.66 --> 4161.2
it away - stop that light from burning

4157.93 --> 4163.81
in that black hole in your soul it's not

4161.2 --> 4166.69
gonna stop I'm gonna shine all the way

4163.81 --> 4172.120000000001
through it all the way to the end until

4166.69 --> 4176.919999999999
there's no more sense to hiding until

4172.12 --> 4178.93
there's no more sense to hide you can

4176.92 --> 4180.06
try whatever you want good luck with

4178.93 --> 4183.37
that

4180.06 --> 4185.609
good onion good Anya if you have sent a

4183.37 --> 4188.5
little bit frustrated sometime so so the

4185.609 --> 4194.2300000000005
Einstein woman so I saw the thing that P

4188.5 --> 4200.41
Mars did he moans made a little video of

4194.23 --> 4203.679999999999
you singing did you see that no I don't

4200.41 --> 4206.349999999999
really follow team-wise I think you were

4203.68 --> 4208.42
getting angry over something I can't

4206.35 --> 4211.870000000001
remember what yeah I got angry out for

4208.42 --> 4216.61
several things in the last week so you

4211.87 --> 4219.4
over that now no no everything I got

4216.61 --> 4220.48
angry about was very heartfelt it's

4219.4 --> 4223.2699999999995
still there

4220.48 --> 4226.48
okay I just couldn't handle the pressure

4223.27 --> 4228.150000000001
at the time so I expressed it in full to

4226.48 --> 4231.4
show what it really is

4228.15 --> 4234.429
that's it but no everything I get angry

4231.4 --> 4237.759999999999
about to that extent that I explode like

4234.429 --> 4240.119
that yeah it persists it's there for a

4237.76 --> 4243.7300000000005
good reason

4240.119 --> 4248.489
but yeah anger is it's a mode is a

4243.73 --> 4251.829
switch it's a process of transformation

4248.489 --> 4255.718999999999
two fingers a certain direction and yeah

4251.829 --> 4260.44
it's it's a method the anger is method

4255.719 --> 4262.15
get over it and ya can't do it

4260.44 --> 4265.69
can't keep doing it doesn't work doesn't

4262.15 --> 4269.11
it's not constructive so when it's too

4265.69 --> 4272.86
much I indulge but otherwise I'm just

4269.11 --> 4278.369
gonna try to be more creative about the

4272.86 --> 4278.369
problems that bother me the burdens me

4278.45 --> 4281.889999999999
that's good for you I think he's good

4280.16 --> 4285.32
for you sometimes scaring her

4281.89 --> 4288.35
yep I sometimes do it when I'm I'm

4285.32 --> 4290.48
bowling all the Bowl - too fast just to

4288.35 --> 4293.09
get rid of their energy excess energy

4290.48 --> 4296.5
all right right there when somebody

4293.09 --> 4301.28
warns me up yeah well some people go and

4296.5 --> 4303.95
chop wood blocks very exhilarating can

4301.28 --> 4308.44
be make your like pissed off it's like

4303.95 --> 4308.44
okay you could like kill all people know

4311.59 --> 4316.13
so yeah excellent

4313.52 --> 4322.780000000001
the thought of chopping logs makes me

4316.13 --> 4326.66
tired as is yeah I used to like it

4322.78 --> 4328.49
no I did you have a look fine no it's a

4326.66 --> 4329.2699999999995
long time ago but when I was still a

4328.49 --> 4334.37
teenager

4329.27 --> 4336.77
we had a big shared home an old farm

4334.37 --> 4340.28
that was built in every bit made into a

4336.77 --> 4343.39
home it's very old it's too old now had

4340.28 --> 4346.46
a home of my grandma's in the northern

4343.39 --> 4347.660000000001
provinces of the Netherlands and we used

4346.46 --> 4349.28
to gather there with the whole family

4347.66 --> 4351.5
and that's like in the middle of a

4349.28 --> 4353.84
forest almost with you quite unique

4351.5 --> 4356.3
right next to a force and it was very

4353.84 --> 4358.25
forest heat so there was a lot of wood

4356.3 --> 4360.53
stuff and we had to take care of the

4358.25 --> 4362.06
trees and cut down some and someone gets

4360.53 --> 4365.09
sick and all that and so there would be

4362.06 --> 4367.9400000000005
wood coming out of her ass and there was

4365.09 --> 4371.4800000000005
a big fireplace and yeah sounds good

4367.94 --> 4373.91
it was awesome in retrospect and I feel

4371.48 --> 4375.679999999999
really annoyed that I was complaining

4373.91 --> 4378.8
about it all the time and just wanted to

4375.68 --> 4380.39
play video games knowing now it's like

4378.8 --> 4384.2300000000005
oh my god what did I miss

4380.39 --> 4386.54
why can't I go back now because now this

4384.23 --> 4389.23
seems so awesome but I wasn't interested

4386.54 --> 4391.61
better then yeah it's funny how you

4389.23 --> 4394.599999999999
change your mind about things as you get

4391.61 --> 4394.599999999999
older isn't it yeah

4395.329 --> 4400.82
I think I'd like to live in a failed

4398.57 --> 4403.179
with the small waters in a pond it'd be

4400.82 --> 4403.179
ideal

4408.11 --> 4412.36
yeah it would be cool but

4413.01 --> 4419.95
yeah how what type of home

4416.86 --> 4425.32
costea debt that house what it was the

4419.95 --> 4427.69
transformed farm was a mess like it's so

4425.32 --> 4429.46
much work to maintain it in the way it

4427.69 --> 4432.79
was

4429.46 --> 4434.11
that's not viable way to build houses

4432.79 --> 4437.2
really in my opinion it's an

4434.11 --> 4438.849999999999
old-fashioned way it worked but can it

4437.2 --> 4443.429999999999
can be done much better now

4438.85 --> 4443.43
was it was it a single wall building

4443.91 --> 4454.18
well it was like think of a giant very

4448.21 --> 4455.77
high roof just a huge freakin roof that

4454.18 --> 4457.66
was originally probably almost

4455.77 --> 4460.56
completely open and they just built

4457.66 --> 4463.96
floors in it in a very irregular way

4460.56 --> 4466.27
it's very improvised building and it's

4463.96 --> 4470.25
very fascinating and interesting we met

4466.27 --> 4472.900000000001
I had some real fantasy moments there

4470.25 --> 4474.94
Lichter II would go explore that

4472.9 --> 4477.73
building as a little kid and was

4474.94 --> 4480.61
terrified by some things there and there

4477.73 --> 4482.74
were also rats at times instances this

4480.61 --> 4487.21
was a crazy farm thing but it was

4482.74 --> 4490.03
fascinating when you live in a farm or

4487.21 --> 4493.36
what's the nature tends to encroach

4490.03 --> 4496.78
doesn't it yes it does very much so

4493.36 --> 4500.679999999999
especially that place so I would I like

4496.78 --> 4506.04
the concept but now I if I'd had the

4500.68 --> 4509.070000000001
choice I have a an eco house built

4506.04 --> 4512.31
and yes maybe kind of a new concept but

4509.07 --> 4514.92
I was in to this even with my

4512.31 --> 4519.240000000001
ex-girlfriend she may have actually had

4514.92 --> 4521.82
one of these things built a house very

4519.24 --> 4523.59
specifically designed house designed

4521.82 --> 4526.59
from scratch that would be completely

4523.59 --> 4532.05
self-sufficient it would have its own

4526.59 --> 4534.87
self containing sewer system yeah using

4532.05 --> 4539.33
River plants to basically filter out

4534.87 --> 4542.46
everything and that that stuff exists

4539.33 --> 4544.67
for at least a decade it's out there the

4542.46 --> 4548.66
companies that do that and I'm very

4544.67 --> 4553.26
fascinated about this super modernized

4548.66 --> 4556.65
eco technology that is what I am really

4553.26 --> 4559.97
into and what I want to get into a lot

4556.65 --> 4563.759999999999
and I would love to have like a big

4559.97 --> 4566.1900000000005
really cool building that is just built

4563.76 --> 4570.63
like that that can stand the test of

4566.19 --> 4574.23
time and and save costs and save

4570.63 --> 4575.67
pollution and everything like it would

4574.23 --> 4576.69
be perfect for me like eating completely

4575.67 --> 4578.58
organic

4576.69 --> 4581.3099999999995
yeah like everything I'm gonna be

4578.58 --> 4583.44
pissing on and pooing it will be

4581.31 --> 4585.870000000001
recycled and because I'm completely

4583.44 --> 4587.61
clean yeah nothing is gonna suffer from

4585.87 --> 4590.39
it so it's gonna last forever

4587.61 --> 4593.61
potentially that kind of thing and I

4590.39 --> 4596.76
don't know what else is possible I mean

4593.61 --> 4598.92
that like solar cell powered mmm my

4596.76 --> 4602.31
friends go free roaming chickens that

4598.92 --> 4605.37
kind of stuff loved the idea my friends

4602.31 --> 4608.490000000001
got a lot of solar panels on his his

4605.37 --> 4612.09
house he lives in the field and he's got

4608.49 --> 4614.639999999999
under the garage a small room full of

4612.09 --> 4619.2
batteries that store up the electricity

4614.64 --> 4620.67
so he can use it okay and he's got he

4619.2 --> 4622.59
sunk some I don't know how it's called

4620.67 --> 4626.16
it's a which strange technologies got

4622.59 --> 4629.92
underfloor heating yeah yeah yeah yeah

4626.16 --> 4633.37
yeah that's also part of what

4629.92 --> 4637.0
the eco-house used fascinating it's run

4633.37 --> 4642.3099999999995
from deeply sunk pipes into the land

4637.0 --> 4643.179
that he took it's amazing it is it is

4642.31 --> 4648.52
mind-blowing

4643.179 --> 4650.7390000000005
and I wanted part of it you know and you

4648.52 --> 4652.719
can extend that you know it all depends

4650.739 --> 4655.15
you can build this out as far as you

4652.719 --> 4658.78
like you can build a panic room you can

4655.15 --> 4663.849999999999
have like this huge food cellar store or

4658.78 --> 4671.62
even like a print a food production

4663.85 --> 4672.910000000001
system so much you can do to go back to

4671.62 --> 4675.16
the old ways I remember my

4672.91 --> 4677.37
great-grandmother and pickling a lot of

4675.16 --> 4677.37
thing

4678.449 --> 4686.28
freeze-drying it's also a very good

4681.19 --> 4689.889999999999
method to store food and I'd like to

4686.28 --> 4693.4
basically get back to the wizard ways

4689.89 --> 4697.51
and get your herbs and stuff and like

4693.4 --> 4701.7699999999995
make my own car kuma and make my own CBD

4697.51 --> 4703.87
oil and of all these magical herbs and

4701.77 --> 4708.280000000001
the elixirs that are just fantastic for

4703.87 --> 4711.4
anyone that uses them just a regular

4708.28 --> 4718.36
magic of nature are you allowed to grow

4711.4 --> 4721.239
cannabis in yeah unlimited amounts you

4718.36 --> 4724.42
can turn five plants per person here

4721.239 --> 4729.57
right okay you could get your own CBD

4724.42 --> 4732.4890000000005
oil one yeah well you can buy CBD oil so

4729.57 --> 4734.59
but the whole thing is about yeah if you

4732.489 --> 4736.87
breed your own plants and you look very

4734.59 --> 4739.78
carefully and you like fine-tune the

4736.87 --> 4742.179
soil bringing amazing nutrients for the

4739.78 --> 4747.009999999999
plants that are just like ultra mega

4742.179 --> 4749.56
soil as purely organic as fathomable and

4747.01 --> 4751.749
then breed plants on that and then

4749.56 --> 4755.979
extract the herbs from that and

4751.749 --> 4759.219
my god it's like pure pure nature magic

4755.979 --> 4762.269
and the concentrated stuff I'd love to

4759.219 --> 4766.449
do that I did make my own cannabis a

4762.269 --> 4768.820000000001
while back and that was really really

4766.449 --> 4771.308999999999
good quality like I get it gave it a lot

4768.82 --> 4775.018999999999
of attention like I really nourish

4771.309 --> 4779.499
cherish the plants as they croak and

4775.019 --> 4783.820000000001
yeah it yields it yields result like the

4779.499 --> 4787.599
cannabis is blessed in a way it's more

4783.82 --> 4790.69
personal it's interesting Awards one of

4787.599 --> 4795.269
the old guys I go bowling with he's got

4790.69 --> 4797.739
Parkinson's and he takes CBD instead of

4795.269 --> 4800.229
all the beta blockers that they gave him

4797.739 --> 4802.888999999999
it does an amazing job yeah it does it

4800.229 --> 4805.09
actually works

4802.889 --> 4808.2390000000005
he certainly helps him a lot

4805.09 --> 4812.400000000001
it needs the super-strong stuff but it

4808.239 --> 4816.968999999999
really does work right because the

4812.4 --> 4821.289
debita blockers the pro propanol we're

4816.969 --> 4825.479
making him really ill uh-huh so yeah in

4821.289 --> 4828.759999999999
that case nature did a lot of good

4825.479 --> 4832.09
should be available to everybody it is

4828.76 --> 4834.88
or it will be in America at least CBD

4832.09 --> 4838.329
oil through hemp has become completely

4834.88 --> 4841.53
legalized so like seriously sorry to

4838.329 --> 4845.11
bring it up but like even Alex Jones

4841.53 --> 4846.999
sells CBD oil right now yeah it happened

4845.11 --> 4849.82
finally it's about damn time you would

4846.999 --> 4853.659
say and he got it from truly extracted

4849.82 --> 4856.09
from hemp so there's no drug or illegal

4853.659 --> 4860.199
issues with it at all yeah it's there

4856.09 --> 4862.4490000000005
now it's it's arrived the hemp age it

4860.199 --> 4864.61
has arrived it's not just smoking

4862.449 --> 4866.949
cannabis anymore and that's great plan

4864.61 --> 4871.17
for making clothes as well for so many

4866.949 --> 4872.969
thing industry textile industry but even

4871.17 --> 4875.76
building industry

4872.969 --> 4878.28
building material there is so many

4875.76 --> 4882.63
things that can be done with him it's

4878.28 --> 4885.8099999999995
it's mind-boggling yeah I mean I don't

4882.63 --> 4888.6900000000005
use it myself or or smoke but I can see

4885.81 --> 4891.360000000001
the good but it did for this guy and you

4888.69 --> 4894.259999999999
have to speak Howard it did amazing talk

4891.36 --> 4898.5
indeed and and another another thing

4894.26 --> 4902.54
that's even a bonus and that his hemp

4898.5 --> 4907.92
plants are actually really good for soil

4902.54 --> 4910.53
right who would have imagined that so it

4907.92 --> 4912.78
is a win win win win win win win it's

4910.53 --> 4917.34
like there's nobody losing except the

4912.78 --> 4919.679999999999
darkness in the face of these plants so

4917.34 --> 4925.32
you know who wants to keep them illegal

4919.68 --> 4928.08
you know it yeah yeah the they very

4925.32 --> 4935.099999999999
reluctant to use it for pain relief over

4928.08 --> 4938.07
here in the UK very reluctant which is a

4935.1 --> 4940.610000000001
shame it is because they're just two

4938.07 --> 4947.009999999999
nine people and put your people at risk

4940.61 --> 4950.16
with the more chemicals really no that's

4947.01 --> 4951.719
mainly the point of it really I don't

4950.16 --> 4954.75
know you read some of the side effects

4951.719 --> 4956.969
on these tablets and you know when you

4954.75 --> 4960.33
read things like could cause suicidal

4956.969 --> 4963.719
thoughts you've got to wonder why they

4960.33 --> 4967.8
were prescribed yes yeah but that's my

4963.719 --> 4969.81
point it's like when you go too far when

4967.8 --> 4973.650000000001
you look check pharmaceuticals when you

4969.81 --> 4976.5
think you're gonna try that look at the

4973.65 --> 4978.87
prescription see what it says it does

4976.5 --> 4982.409
and then look at the side effects and

4978.87 --> 4986.78
then you switch it around

4982.409 --> 4989.549999999999
and then see if it's still worth it and

4986.78 --> 4991.38
do the same with natural herbs

4989.55 --> 4993.4800000000005
look there's there's two herbs that are

4991.38 --> 4995.13
just said this does this it's they're

4993.48 --> 4997.709999999999
not gonna offer it to you but if you go

4995.13 --> 5001.63
look for it it's there and those things

4997.71 --> 5004.76
have barely - absolutely no side effects

5001.63 --> 5008.27
and the pharmaceuticals a massive list

5004.76 --> 5011.42
of insane options that could happen due

5008.27 --> 5014.719
to this just who's gonna take that

5011.42 --> 5017.21
except for an insane person that is

5014.719 --> 5018.949
completely irresponsible can't take care

5017.21 --> 5022.4
of themselves because they don't have

5018.949 --> 5027.65
the wisdom to take care of themselves

5022.4 --> 5029.2699999999995
that's really what that is let's give an

5027.65 --> 5033.679
example our when he's just gone back

5029.27 --> 5037.040000000001
this week they prescribed serotonin boy

5033.679 --> 5040.1
which which is the one that as a third

5037.04 --> 5044.15
effective causing suicidal thoughts and

5040.1 --> 5047.389
he just didn't fancy you know who wants

5044.15 --> 5049.61
that one to living alone serotonin

5047.389 --> 5053.33
reuptake inhibitors are very dangerous

5049.61 --> 5057.7699999999995
yes they can cost cataclysmic

5053.33 --> 5060.44
instabilities they gave him that for he

5057.77 --> 5063.02
suffers a lot from anxiety he doesn't

5060.44 --> 5065.9
like to do different things he likes to

5063.02 --> 5070.46
do the same thing just going somewhere

5065.9 --> 5073.19
new I guess in a bit of a tangle yeah he

5070.46 --> 5075.469
has some resistance yeah from with it

5073.19 --> 5080.449
I'll tell let me tell you that stuff

5075.469 --> 5083.42
does not help but the only reason anyone

5080.449 --> 5086.469
should ever even possibly consider it is

5083.42 --> 5090.29
if they are so chronically depressed

5086.469 --> 5092.87
that they're just not

5090.29 --> 5094.78
and they don't feel like a normal human

5092.87 --> 5097.34
anymore and it has to be real not some

5094.78 --> 5099.38
imagining thing that's something I want

5097.34 --> 5101.87
to be special attention no like

5099.38 --> 5105.08
seriously if it's just unbearable okay

5101.87 --> 5106.73
maybe then you know you could consider

5105.08 --> 5108.29
it I said that wouldn't recommend it

5106.73 --> 5113.15
there's other ways to do it there's like

5108.29 --> 5115.91
you could take it cold again is st.

5113.15 --> 5119.21
John's worth there is antidepressant st.

5115.91 --> 5121.19
John's work it's much less risky it's

5119.21 --> 5129.71
also an option it's just one of these

5121.19 --> 5131.95
things but yeah it's cierra serotonin

5129.71 --> 5136.7300000000005
reuptake inhibitors are like a

5131.95 --> 5140.57
dramatical thing to do and should only

5136.73 --> 5142.7
be even considered as a very very last

5140.57 --> 5145.969999999999
resort because the dangers are just

5142.7 --> 5147.05
incredible so it's not something to be

5145.97 --> 5149.0
taken lightly

5147.05 --> 5151.72
literally you shouldn't take it lightly

5149.0 --> 5154.25
shouldn't take it for just nothing else

5151.72 --> 5156.97
credibly dangerous one can do to you

5154.25 --> 5156.97
it's unpredictable

5158.17 --> 5164.11
always has been there's been it becomes

5162.1 --> 5166.39
even more unpredictable when you combine

5164.11 --> 5169.99
it with other pharmaceuticals aggravates

5166.39 --> 5172.21
them and it's usually standard by the

5169.99 --> 5174.4
way more pharmaceuticals more chemical

5172.21 --> 5177.93
non natural pharmaceuticals you combine

5174.4 --> 5180.94
the more erratic it becomes the more the

5177.93 --> 5182.17
side-effects start to pop up that's what

5180.94 --> 5183.639999999999
will happen to my mother that's what

5182.17 --> 5186.52
killed her okay

5183.64 --> 5191.85
from one pharmaceutical and another and

5186.52 --> 5195.13
another and another and she just mutated

5191.85 --> 5198.13
first slowly and then rapidly they

5195.13 --> 5202.33
always we're gonna go under people

5198.13 --> 5206.32
watching oh cool yeah hello everyone

5202.33 --> 5211.24
thanks for coming yeah shout out to

5206.32 --> 5216.79
Chuck to the same and Jose doe seen you

5211.24 --> 5220.78
guys for a while you know we're having a

5216.79 --> 5223.81
good health chat yes right and the

5220.78 --> 5229.679999999999
flatlander makes a point natural

5223.81 --> 5233.530000000001
medicine can have side effects too well

5229.68 --> 5237.1900000000005
that depends of course but what is gonna

5233.53 --> 5240.509999999999
be the side effect and think about it

5237.19 --> 5244.33
like this when somebody is having

5240.51 --> 5246.55
pharmaceuticals then something natural

5244.33 --> 5249.73
could have a side effect that is off

5246.55 --> 5252.31
because the pharmaceuticals that have to

5249.73 --> 5254.889999999999
stabilize you are usually people that

5252.31 --> 5257.080000000001
don't use any pharmaceutical crap that

5254.89 --> 5259.740000000001
are clean they don't get any side

5257.08 --> 5264.7
effects from the natural medicine ever

5259.74 --> 5268.2699999999995
never seen it so unless there's some

5264.7 --> 5271.12
weird natural psychotropic stuff k can

5268.27 --> 5277.47
be dangerous and also st. John's worth

5271.12 --> 5280.8099999999995
is known to be also potentially risky

5277.47 --> 5285.0
but not catastrophically so but it can

5280.81 --> 5288.1900000000005
have an unexpected turn as

5285.0 --> 5292.21
kind of similar to SSRIs except yeah

5288.19 --> 5294.879999999999
much much less impactful leverage never

5292.21 --> 5297.76
heard of anyone that went to st. John's

5294.88 --> 5299.38
worth and because of that like started

5297.76 --> 5302.08
going on a killing spree or anything

5299.38 --> 5307.33
well with SSRIs that seems to be more

5302.08 --> 5314.08
common then than any other type of

5307.33 --> 5318.43
influence even so but yeah on average no

5314.08 --> 5321.19
natural remedies very little to no side

5318.43 --> 5324.990000000001
effects especially when you compare them

5321.19 --> 5324.99
with their pharmaceutical counterparts

5325.08 --> 5331.24
yeah and besides there's also indeed God

5329.29 --> 5335.59
heals too there's other things there's

5331.24 --> 5341.719
also just spirit healing him that's also

5335.59 --> 5344.54
a thing that can help and well that

5341.719 --> 5346.719
that just doesn't have side effects

5344.54 --> 5348.98
really unless you're doing it wrong

5346.719 --> 5351.92
you're not approaching it the right way

5348.98 --> 5354.799999999999
then yeah that's good you could screw up

5351.92 --> 5356.81
with energy works you're approaching it

5354.8 --> 5359.63
wrong if you don't really get what's

5356.81 --> 5363.530000000001
going on if you're not into enough

5359.63 --> 5365.21
things can go wrong but on average when

5363.53 --> 5367.489
you know what you're doing knows there

5365.21 --> 5370.449
is no negative side effects ever it's

5367.489 --> 5372.7699999999995
only positive side effects usually even

5370.449 --> 5374.9
unexpected positive side effects that's

5372.77 --> 5379.969
the funny thing about me

5374.9 --> 5384.08
Seymour you have got a question for you

5379.969 --> 5386.719
Alan mm-hmm what do you think about how

5384.08 --> 5389.51
the pharmaceutical industry is going and

5386.719 --> 5397.4
particularly the drug market for things

5389.51 --> 5401.860000000001
like flaca crocodile fentanyl the older

5397.4 --> 5401.86
fake really super-strong opioids that

5402.16 --> 5406.67
they seem really popular on the street

5404.51 --> 5410.42
yeah yeah really popular because they're

5406.67 --> 5413.96
being handed out like legalized the new

5410.42 --> 5415.82
party drug or yeah it's terrible and

5413.96 --> 5417.46
that stuff like that new super

5415.82 --> 5420.5599999999995
concentrated

5417.46 --> 5424.31
it's basically super concentrated heroin

5420.56 --> 5429.219
in a way weaponized heroin beyond heroin

5424.31 --> 5432.469
is already weaponized this is again

5429.219 --> 5436.88
fentanyl no but the original substance

5432.469 --> 5440.57
the plant open opium rights Aaron is

5436.88 --> 5443.900000000001
weaponized opium well that new stuff is

5440.57 --> 5447.61
weaponized heroin it's beyond its and

5443.9 --> 5450.799999999999
it's dangerous like you can get killed

5447.61 --> 5452.999
really quickly from overdosing that [ __ ]

5450.8 --> 5455.789
and that seems to be happening

5452.999 --> 5458.46
a lot a lot of people have died I'm

5455.789 --> 5460.679
overdosing with that [ __ ] just in recent

5458.46 --> 5462.84
years so I've heard so if seen in news

5460.679 --> 5464.82
articles never met anyone personal but

5462.84 --> 5470.67
nine of that but apparently that's

5464.82 --> 5472.19
happening yeah I just worry I watched a

5470.67 --> 5474.329
few of the videos mmm

5472.19 --> 5476.249
really just see what he's doing to

5474.329 --> 5481.67
people and you just think how could

5476.249 --> 5484.978999999999
somebody legitimately make this money

5481.67 --> 5487.469
amazing yeah you sacrifice a group of

5484.979 --> 5491.519
people that are stupid enough to do it

5487.469 --> 5494.94
for you and you make a huge amount of

5491.519 --> 5500.46
money from it it's very evil and it's

5494.94 --> 5502.888999999999
allowed yeah so it's like that spice

5500.46 --> 5505.079
things that all the kids smoke this

5502.889 --> 5505.9490000000005
smelly on the street smells like

5505.079 --> 5511.32
chemicals

5505.949 --> 5515.848999999999
oh you mean perfume the the fake

5511.32 --> 5517.289
cannabis oh that stuff I don't know what

5515.849 --> 5521.6990000000005
that is but it's disgusting

5517.289 --> 5526.289
this is ice hydro it's super stronger

5521.699 --> 5530.329
made in China hmm I don't know I think I

5526.289 --> 5533.88
tried that once in like on a festival

5530.329 --> 5535.889
2001 or something yeah I was then yeah

5533.88 --> 5540.749
that stuff was disgusting you know

5535.889 --> 5542.46
almost made me throw up yeah why do all

5540.749 --> 5547.11
the kids want everything super strong

5542.46 --> 5550.17
one must be super strong Garrett because

5547.11 --> 5552.78
they're so used to everything because

5550.17 --> 5555.63
yeah the more you start abusing stuff

5552.78 --> 5559.11
the more numbed down your senses become

5555.63 --> 5563.6900000000005
to their influences so you would go

5559.11 --> 5563.69
stronger until you break

5564.629 --> 5570.149
it's a lot of people yeah the older you

5567.899 --> 5575.099
get the longer you've done that [ __ ] and

5570.149 --> 5577.26
the more the you saving the more

5575.099 --> 5579.979
confidence you will be is like now I'm

5577.26 --> 5585.09
used to so much I'll just take a big

5579.979 --> 5592.349
dose of this I can can't go wrong look

5585.09 --> 5596.249
drugs very dangerous you know it's not

5592.349 --> 5598.53
just the the danger with drugs regular

5596.249 --> 5602.159
like especially mind influencing drugs

5598.53 --> 5605.249
it is not the moment the one moment it

5602.159 --> 5607.768999999999
is always the gradual process over time

5605.249 --> 5609.599
and how are are you gonna get addicted

5607.769 --> 5612.059
to it how are you gonna deal with that

5609.599 --> 5613.979
are you going to increase using it

5612.059 --> 5616.289
whether the risks it's always two

5613.979 --> 5618.719
long-term process is never just that

5616.289 --> 5620.459
taking it one at one time if that was

5618.719 --> 5623.909
the issue that drugs would not be a

5620.459 --> 5626.28
problem to humanity just use it once

5623.909 --> 5629.759999999999
it's like oh that's interesting and okay

5626.28 --> 5632.938999999999
yeah but people do get fascinated get

5629.76 --> 5634.8
obsessed even with such an experience

5632.939 --> 5636.869000000001
and they just go and want to repeat it

5634.8 --> 5640.139
over and over and over again and to be

5636.869 --> 5642.688999999999
fair that is kind of how I got into

5640.139 --> 5645.539
cannabis causing that such an impact on

5642.689 --> 5648.539000000001
me when I first started it that I was

5645.539 --> 5653.3
just like wow what is this my senses are

5648.539 --> 5656.188999999999
more I can see more I can feel more

5653.3 --> 5660.929
subtle thing I can sensory almost see

5656.189 --> 5663.09
things that I feel about people or like

5660.929 --> 5667.499
I could see like spiritual energy like

5663.09 --> 5671.579
it was such amazing experience and now

5667.499 --> 5675.389
all that is no longer literally visible

5671.579 --> 5676.829
to me but it is in the background I just

5675.389 --> 5680.129
know it's there now that's the

5676.829 --> 5682.199
difference and the drug is the

5680.129 --> 5684.04
experience is not as gratifying as a

5682.199 --> 5687.879999999999
duty as gratifying as

5684.04 --> 5689.59
used to be days I can't comment I've

5687.88 --> 5693.22
never I've never taken drugs the most

5689.59 --> 5694.96
dangerous thing I've done is cake well

5693.22 --> 5698.1900000000005
you know that sugar is actually quite a

5694.96 --> 5701.64
dangerous drug I do like a battenburg

5698.19 --> 5705.94
right well as far as drugs are concerned

5701.64 --> 5711.01
only thing I really delve into our

5705.94 --> 5714.669999999999
cannabis and alcohol and well I suppose

5711.01 --> 5715.3
I do alcohol yeah in moderation three

5714.67 --> 5718.21
halves

5715.3 --> 5720.400000000001
well me not so in moderation but I'm

5718.21 --> 5720.82
very sensitive to alcohol so that's very

5720.4 --> 5725.339999999999
easy

5720.82 --> 5729.61
I wish do you drink are we so not a lot

5725.34 --> 5732.34
not regular anyway but like when I drink

5729.61 --> 5737.41
beer I may drink like four to six beers

5732.34 --> 5739.4800000000005
or something that's a lot to me and or a

5737.41 --> 5741.4
bottle of wine and yeah that can't go

5739.48 --> 5744.099999999999
wrong like it did to a couple of days

5741.4 --> 5747.16
ago and during the Blood Moon or it can

5744.1 --> 5749.17
go absolutely right so I don't drink a

5747.16 --> 5753.04
lot of it and I don't drink it regularly

5749.17 --> 5755.92
and I especially avoid really strong

5753.04 --> 5761.13
alcoholic drinks no I probably last time

5755.92 --> 5763.6990000000005
I really drank that is in 2005 to now

5761.13 --> 5767.84
2006

5763.699 --> 5770.2699999999995
no that's not true 2008 and then I kinda

5767.84 --> 5772.04
like felt okay the side effects of

5770.27 --> 5775.31
strong alcohol just not worth it anymore

5772.04 --> 5777.05
I can literally feel myself aging every

5775.31 --> 5778.75
time I do this I'm not gonna do it

5777.05 --> 5783.26
anymore

5778.75 --> 5785.9
just basic beers and wine is good enough

5783.26 --> 5788.179
for me now yeah same here

5785.9 --> 5793.549999999999
