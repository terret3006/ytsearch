104.88 --> 108.15899999999999
is a bit

108.32 --> 113.03999999999999
dreary it's kind of

113.32 --> 118.83999999999999
clouded big gray

115.64 --> 121.039
soup and it is

118.84 --> 124.56
like yeah

121.039 --> 127.119
raining slightly every now and then so

124.56 --> 130.599
it's kind of wet out

127.119 --> 132.48
there trees down there are starting to

130.599 --> 136.56
really Blossom especially the one on the

132.48 --> 136.56
right you can already see it through the

136.92 --> 141.07999999999998
webcam so it's really starting to

142.08 --> 147.92000000000002
Blossom my rosemary plant is by the way

144.92 --> 150.92
like really blossoming heavy or well it

147.92 --> 155.67999999999998
was but it's just keeps going I repotted

150.92 --> 159.35999999999999
it you might see it's now in that blue

155.68 --> 159.36
pot I'll show you

159.44 --> 165.8
soon but uh yeah overall the weather

162.519 --> 169.20000000000002
today doesn't seem to be

165.8 --> 169.20000000000002
very very

171.12 --> 178.229
pleasant we'll see where that

175.07 --> 178.22899999999998
[Music]

178.84 --> 183.36
goes

180.56 --> 187.4
all right so hello clear first in chat

183.36 --> 187.4
good to see you a man goat good to see

2024 and the temperature is 11° C with

234.239 --> 241.72
87% humidity

238.04 --> 241.72
yeah looks like that

242.799 --> 249.72
only 5%

245.76 --> 252.75
precipitation okay

249.72 --> 252.75
[Music]

258.04 --> 264.44
right did you see the bridge in

261.199 --> 264.44
Baltimore the

264.919 --> 271.08
bridge you mean the whole collapse

267.96 --> 273.479
things or another brid Bridge cuz it's

271.08 --> 276.59999999999997
kind of hard to not have seen the bridge

273.479 --> 279.44
in Baltimore collapse at this point hey

276.6 --> 279.44
clutch good to see

280.0 --> 285.8
you yes that one yeah we saw it all

282.96 --> 285.79999999999995
right

297.039 --> 301.639
God no I talked about it

302.28 --> 307.52
on the show that has one rich too far in

305.28 --> 307.52
the

321.68 --> 326.28000000000003
title so talked about

324.6 --> 328.639
it

326.28 --> 331.63899999999995
uh

328.639 --> 331.639
Wednesday

332.16 --> 335.24
yeah I've been talking about

339.759 --> 345.08000000000004
it miss my show yesterday clutch yeah I

342.68 --> 346.8
was at a different time I did tweet it

345.08 --> 349.12
out

346.8 --> 352.24
though and I did announce it the day

349.12 --> 353.17
before that I was going to be doing show

352.24 --> 356.319
at a later

353.17 --> 360.319
[Music]

356.319 --> 363.24
time ended up ice fishing oh okay

360.319 --> 363.24
that sounds kind of

364.08 --> 368.35999999999996
cool for the first time ever

369.8 --> 375.36
hm oh you did miss an interesting show

372.639 --> 378.639
yesterday it was very

375.36 --> 382.759
esoteric talked about Witchcraft and all

378.639 --> 386.68
that and found a new yeah a a word

382.759 --> 388.96000000000004
paradox everybody got all over excited

386.68 --> 390.68
with thought that I made another mistake

388.96 --> 393.19899999999996
somehow

390.68 --> 396.639
but instead I just ended up kind of

393.199 --> 399.599
finding a a word paradox about the word

396.639 --> 404.08
ignorance which was really actually kind

399.599 --> 404.08
of interesting it's confusing but

414.199 --> 418.40000000000003
interesting right

416.039 --> 420.68
also still fresh in the memory Owen

418.4 --> 424.15999999999997
Benjamin show yesterday it was

420.68 --> 426.08
really it was mostly just kind of like

424.16 --> 430.16
Rowdy

426.08 --> 432.19899999999996
stuff a lot of [ __ ] talking as usual but

430.16 --> 434.12
at the end part it was really

432.199 --> 438.28000000000003
interesting

434.12 --> 442.879
he he pulled up like a video from Game

438.28 --> 445.84
Theory and the esoterics of it were like

442.879 --> 445.84000000000003
really

447.199 --> 452.72
fascinating because it basically

450.4 --> 456.75899999999996
proved

452.72 --> 464.199
mathematically through Game Theory

456.759 --> 464.199
how different types of uh General

464.36 --> 469.56
approaches work out on average

467.36 --> 474.0
statistically

469.56 --> 476.639
like let's just say how the Christ

474.0 --> 480.08
method would hold up

476.639 --> 483.12
versus more devious approaches it was

480.08 --> 487.0
almost like mathematical approach

483.12 --> 490.0
to to long-term diplomacy it was really

487.0 --> 493.159
fascinating it really

490.0 --> 497.24
was certainly blew my

493.159 --> 501.12
mind all right so that was a yesterday

497.24 --> 503.639
show starting at the in ow Benjamin show

501.12 --> 505.12
from yesterday starting at the 1 hour 48

503.639 --> 508.919
minute

505.12 --> 511.44
Mark it's really really interesting and

508.919 --> 511.44
worth watching

517.98 --> 521.21
[Music]

524.76 --> 531.12
in it was

527.839 --> 534.0400000000001
like the mathematical proof that the

531.12 --> 537.12
Christ method is the best is the winning

534.04 --> 539.959
method it's that's a very

537.12 --> 543.9590000000001
rough description of it but it basically

539.959 --> 543.959
comes down to that really really

545.76 --> 548.76
interesting

553.2 --> 560.5600000000001
anyway bit of a slow start today kind of

557.04 --> 563.56
frustrated because I've like run out of

560.56 --> 566.8
series again at Netflix to

563.56 --> 569.1199999999999
watch after that one body problem like

566.8 --> 572.16
there's nothing really out there that

569.12 --> 572.16
can match up to

598.32 --> 607.1600000000001
that also very interesting

603.04 --> 611.1999999999999
was surprisingly at The Alex Jones

607.16 --> 614.519
Show like Owen Shroyer had this dentist

611.2 --> 618.519
on that was basically talking about

614.519 --> 623.079
bioenergetic dentistry and holistic

618.519 --> 626.6
stuff and that was just that was fun to

623.079 --> 630.12
see that and especially because well

626.6 --> 632.24
like my ex got really into that

630.12 --> 635.079
so it's like kind of funny hearing all

632.24 --> 638.44
of that back it's like yeah I I

635.079 --> 641.56
literally know like pretty much

638.44 --> 644.1600000000001
everything that she said but it got

641.56 --> 646.279
pretty weird too that apparently in

644.16 --> 647.88
implants like that even Dentistry

646.279 --> 651.16
implants there

647.88 --> 654.4399999999999
are sometimes chips in

651.16 --> 654.4399999999999
there kind of

658.0 --> 662.24
freaky hey jadow good to see

672.839 --> 679.6800000000001
you right but also like there are

675.959 --> 681.8389999999999
apparently like nanot Tech implants in a

679.68 --> 681.8389999999999
lot

682.519 --> 690.079
of like typical pain injections like uh

687.279 --> 693.04
what is it call that pain injections

690.079 --> 693.04
like the

693.519 --> 698.639
uh anesthetic injections that typically

697.279 --> 702.76
happen in

698.639 --> 704.9590000000001
dentistry I heard about that like over a

702.76 --> 708.519
decade

704.959 --> 712.1999999999999
ago I didn't know there was like other

708.519 --> 714.92
than weird poison

712.2 --> 717.76
connection like that for some yeah that

714.92 --> 720.959
that's something I heard a while

717.76 --> 724.12
ago but that there is like weird nanot

720.959 --> 727.5189999999999
Tech stuff being injected with it it's

724.12 --> 727.519
it was kind of freaky in a

736.72 --> 739.9200000000001
way all

742.399 --> 746.839
right A lot of people I'm sure are

744.88 --> 749.16
pretty shocked having watched that

746.839 --> 751.1990000000001
especially because around this time is

749.16 --> 753.68
typically a time that a lot of people do

751.199 --> 755.76
actually like rush to the

753.68 --> 758.959
dentist because it

755.76 --> 763.16
is opening Springtime bacterial Bloom

758.959 --> 764.3599999999999
and Etc all of that and people will

763.16 --> 767.12
typically

764.36 --> 769.36
get like tooth AE issues and that kind

767.12 --> 769.36
of

770.76 --> 776.16
thing right as I did like a couple of

773.839 --> 776.1600000000001
years

777.639 --> 783.72
ago but uh yeah not this year hello did

781.16 --> 783.7199999999999
Gary do

793.36 --> 800.1990000000001
music so yeah

795.6 --> 800.1990000000001
yday pretty information Rich day

800.279 --> 806.0
overall I thought my show was very

802.519 --> 810.32
interesting too it just got kind

806.0 --> 811.72
of I got very esoteric very like about

810.32 --> 814.9200000000001
Spirit

811.72 --> 818.9590000000001
mechanics even sharing some stuff about

814.92 --> 822.199
Witchcraft and like my views on that

818.959 --> 824.6389999999999
things like sacrifices and all

822.199 --> 828.3599999999999
that but then it it kind of got

824.639 --> 832.48
Sidetrack into the word into the

828.36 --> 835.16
conundrum into the Paradox of the word

832.48 --> 838.519
ignorance and that kind of ruined my

835.16 --> 839.68
mood at the time and a troll reveal

838.519 --> 841.24
themselves

839.68 --> 845.4799999999999
in that

841.24 --> 845.48
process they typically like to do

847.32 --> 854.9200000000001
that but it was an

850.759 --> 858.279
interesting discovery about the word

854.92 --> 862.959
ignorance how it is kind of a weird

858.279 --> 862.959
English word that seems to

863.24 --> 871.04
ironically ignore the word ignore in

868.04 --> 871.04
ignorance

875.12 --> 879.44
it's almost like

877.56 --> 883.0
it's

879.44 --> 885.0790000000001
purposefully hiding it in plain sight

883.0 --> 887.839
hiding it in plain sight and

885.079 --> 891.04
confusing

887.839 --> 895.2790000000001
that cuz

891.04 --> 898.04
ignorance would technically

895.279 --> 901.04
mean like without

898.04 --> 901.04
knowledge

901.12 --> 910.48
but not with purpose well ignore

906.44 --> 914.0
is W without knowledge on

910.48 --> 915.9200000000001
purpose and so that is like a

914.0 --> 919.92
self-contradiction that's kind of baked

915.92 --> 919.92
into the word

921.68 --> 927.199
and almost got to wonder if that's like

924.519 --> 929.6
a bit of dark magic a bit of dark

927.199 --> 931.7199999999999
confusion Magic by those that

929.6 --> 934.36
architected the

931.72 --> 936.279
language or that have rearranged the

934.36 --> 940.48
purpose of the language

936.279 --> 943.72
because such a heavy contradiction

940.48 --> 943.72
into a

944.959 --> 951.399
word can only be there to sew confusion

949.12 --> 951.399
on

957.759 --> 963.72
purpose right

959.92 --> 967.4799999999999
and basically me being a bit of a

963.72 --> 972.12
semantic revolutionary saying like

967.48 --> 975.24
uh I I denounce the notion that it isn't

972.12 --> 977.88
based on the word ignorance when it's

975.24 --> 981.639
obviously in

977.88 --> 983.92
there and there's other eological

981.639 --> 988.279
connections through

983.92 --> 992.079
French which hey English is assembled

988.279 --> 994.319
partially from French yeah so that's

992.079 --> 997.079
like another route to

994.319 --> 1000.5999999999999
take instead of going straight to the

997.079 --> 1004.0
Latin so it is all kind of convoluted

1000.6 --> 1004.0
the word ignorance is

1011.959 --> 1016.92
convoluted hey seeking star water good

1014.079 --> 1020.12
to see you so in a way I'm I'm glad that

1016.92 --> 1024.279
that cup that that came afloat yesterday

1020.12 --> 1024.279
in the show at the last

1025.559 --> 1032.9189999999999
segment like it's good to know that more

1029.919 --> 1032.919
upfront

1037.36 --> 1042.839
consciously to basically face the

1039.76 --> 1042.839
Paradox within the

1043.88 --> 1049.5590000000002
word

1045.959 --> 1052.6000000000001
yeah all right so yeah I don't have any

1049.559 --> 1052.6
overt subjects

1055.39 --> 1058.519
[Music]

1068.61 --> 1071.81
[Music]

1077.84 --> 1080.84
today

1086.72 --> 1093.64
right it's Easter weekend tomorrow is

1090.159 --> 1093.64
Easter March the

1104.52 --> 1110.76
31st so that should be

1107.76 --> 1110.76
nice

1112.159 --> 1114.44
hello

1127.91 --> 1132.5
[Music]

1137.72 --> 1140.72
dupons

1145.48 --> 1150.48
okay what is quart zone mean

1153.23 --> 1156.43
[Music]

1167.72 --> 1170.72
Jed

1171.48 --> 1176.3600000000001
all right anyway yeah I thought the

1172.88 --> 1179.3200000000002
yesterday's show actually went pretty

1176.36 --> 1182.7199999999998
well of course I was already awake for

1179.32 --> 1184.12
for a while and then as soon as I sh

1182.72 --> 1186.76
started the show like it just

1184.12 --> 1189.6
immediately went rolling so that was

1186.76 --> 1189.6
kind of nice about

1192.52 --> 1197.32
it

1195.0 --> 1200.52
maybe maybe I'll do that sort of thing

1197.32 --> 1204.3999999999999
more often

1200.52 --> 1208.44
not sure on the other hand I think

1204.4 --> 1210.44
like after tomorrow there should

1208.44 --> 1213.919
be the time

1210.44 --> 1216.919
shift yeah that's right on Easter yeah

1213.919 --> 1220.0
there's a notification here in my

1216.919 --> 1221.5590000000002
clock Daylight Savings Time begins on

1220.0 --> 1226.48
Sunday March

1221.559 --> 1226.48
31st at 2 at

1227.08 --> 1231.84
night so like

1229.96 --> 1234.24
basically this

1231.84 --> 1237.1589999999999
night and that means that I'm going to

1234.24 --> 1240.64
be an hour early for the United States

1237.159 --> 1243.48
and all of Europe is going to be an hour

1240.64 --> 1245.4
earlier so I will still start on 2 p.m.

1243.48 --> 1247.24
Amsterdam time but it will effectively

1245.4 --> 1249.679
be an hour earlier for everybody in the

1247.24 --> 1249.679
United

1250.4 --> 1256.0
States all right so I probably have to

1253.6 --> 1260.6
really make a bit of effort to go to bed

1256.0 --> 1260.6
early this night

1265.36 --> 1270.76
so be aware of

1267.96 --> 1273.559
that time shift

1270.76 --> 1276.08
happens between Today's Show and

1273.559 --> 1276.08
tomorrow

1278.88 --> 1282.6000000000001
show time zone

1287.52 --> 1290.52
shift

1317.52 --> 1320.52
for

1333.4 --> 1337.88
our

1334.84 --> 1340.6399999999999
time changed two weeks ago

1337.88 --> 1343.3200000000002
yeah now that's not weird clutch it's

1340.64 --> 1345.7990000000002
always been like that it's always two

1343.32 --> 1345.799
weeks in

1346.52 --> 1353.96
between not one week but two weeks it's

1349.6 --> 1353.9599999999998
it's like that every half a

1364.24 --> 1369.559
year it's it's a little weird that they

1366.799 --> 1371.72
wait two weeks with it that is kind of

1369.559 --> 1376.279
weird I

1371.72 --> 1380.3600000000001
agree but it is what it is maybe it's

1376.279 --> 1382.679
all about promoting time zone awareness

1380.36 --> 1386.1589999999999
or something I I don't know why the hell

1382.679 --> 1387.679
they do it it it it does seem very

1386.159 --> 1391.3600000000001
unpractical

1387.679 --> 1391.3600000000001
but it is what it

1393.36 --> 1397.8799999999999
is can you just say time change is

1399.039 --> 1404.12
stupid no well yeah you can say that

1402.0 --> 1407.44
definitely I just think that it's based

1404.12 --> 1409.36
on pragmatism they're doing it for

1407.44 --> 1412.72
the

1409.36 --> 1416.84
so that people get a little bit more

1412.72 --> 1416.84
Daylight during summertime

1437.44 --> 1440.44
basically

1441.13 --> 1449.0100000000002
[Music]

1467.36 --> 1470.36
okay

1473.64 --> 1480.039
yeah that's one way of saying it seeking

1475.159 --> 1480.0390000000002
star water I agree it is kind of

1488.52 --> 1494.9189999999999
weird just like it a great

1492.159 --> 1497.679
deal right well the other alternative

1494.919 --> 1500.919
would be that there's like a a national

1497.679 --> 1503.3200000000002
International effort to just say like

1500.919 --> 1507.7990000000002
okay after this

1503.32 --> 1507.799
date working times

1509.48 --> 1512.48
change

1512.559 --> 1519.24
like everybody's working time changes

1516.24 --> 1524.24
right that's the weird issue about

1519.24 --> 1526.76
it is that to change everybody's working

1524.24 --> 1529.32
schedules to an hour

1526.76 --> 1532.84
earlier is basically Bally a lot more

1529.32 --> 1536.8799999999999
hassle than to just automatically change

1532.84 --> 1536.8799999999999
the time zone

1538.919 --> 1544.039
setting so it's actually more efficient

1541.84 --> 1544.039
this

1550.08 --> 1557.039
way us to be for the benefit of the

1553.08 --> 1560.24
farmers in the field but it supposedly

1557.039 --> 1560.24
still is

1573.96 --> 1577.1200000000001
ah D to therea

1577.159 --> 1582.5590000000002
mechanism yeah yeah that is a

1579.32 --> 1582.559
fascinating device isn't

1587.24 --> 1590.24
it

1602.24 --> 1605.32
problem for a

1609.48 --> 1614.919
day well it all depends and if you have

1612.44 --> 1616.64
international relations yeah if you have

1614.919 --> 1620.159
international relations then you have

1616.64 --> 1622.6000000000001
the two weeks of

1620.159 --> 1625.64
disjointedness you get to be reminded

1622.6 --> 1628.36
like oh that show that I follow it's

1625.64 --> 1628.3600000000001
from another

1628.559 --> 1634.279
continent so for me in the last two

1631.08 --> 1638.08
weeks The Alex Jones Show kept starting

1634.279 --> 1638.08
at 5:00 instead of

1640.559 --> 1646.9189999999999
6:00 right so there's like the

1643.44 --> 1650.8400000000001
international Roots just stand out a bit

1646.919 --> 1655.76
more you get the see the difference

1650.84 --> 1655.76
between the Americas and

1658.96 --> 1663.96
Europe that's what I've been noticing

1661.279 --> 1663.96
the most about

1677.12 --> 1680.12
it

1684.08 --> 1690.6399999999999
they have lights and machines now

1687.84 --> 1694.519
uh psychological

1690.64 --> 1698.24
reasons I mean you're just thinking of

1694.519 --> 1702.0
like practical results but also to just

1698.24 --> 1704.84
get earlier change the Rhythm slightly

1702.0 --> 1707.12
will mean getting a bit more Sun during

1704.84 --> 1711.12
the summer

1707.12 --> 1711.12
season spring and summer

1723.36 --> 1728.039
season right anyway I'm going to kind of

1726.44 --> 1732.519
hungry I'm going to turn on my

1728.039 --> 1732.519
Illuminati C and coffee be right

1737.039 --> 1740.039
back

1767.039 --> 1770.039
for

1797.039 --> 1800.039
for

1826.96 --> 1829.96
all

1833.96 --> 1836.919
let me just show you my

1844.679 --> 1851.3990000000001
Rosemary repotted it into a slightly

1848.159 --> 1853.72
bigger blue pot just to give it some

1851.399 --> 1853.7199999999998
fresh

1854.559 --> 1859.9189999999999
dirt seems to be doing fine

1863.559 --> 1866.559
wonder if it's going to like really grow

1865.6 --> 1870.1999999999998
some

1866.559 --> 1870.2
new leaves

1870.72 --> 1876.679
though certainly the overall stem is

1874.32 --> 1876.6789999999999
getting

1879.13 --> 1882.3390000000002
[Music]

1885.279 --> 1891.24
thicker and this plant has been like

1887.519 --> 1891.24
resist zilliant as

1891.679 --> 1897.5590000000002
hell sitting through like snow and

1894.559 --> 1897.559
storms all the

1916.84 --> 1920.9789999999998
time

1917.95 --> 1920.979
[Music]

1922.399 --> 1928.8799999999999
I repotted like the oregano plant I had

1925.0 --> 1928.88
in my kitchen too and it is like

1930.279 --> 1937.36
exploding so yeah it's really like time

1934.36 --> 1939.639
for repotting and repotting plants and

1937.36 --> 1939.639
all

1943.99 --> 1949.84
[Music]

1946.84 --> 1949.84
that

1963.159 --> 1967.72
oh yeah yeah seing star

1967.76 --> 1973.6
definitely I bet your Rosemary plant's

1970.279 --> 1973.6
probably a lot bigger isn't

1976.84 --> 1979.84
it

2006.76 --> 2009.76
m

2036.72 --> 2039.72
br

2045.08 --> 2052.119
sorry just came in climate change is

2048.76 --> 2052.119
slowing the earth

2052.44 --> 2058.639
rotation

2054.32 --> 2058.639
what how did they come up with this

2063.52 --> 2071.399
[ __ ]

2066.44 --> 2071.399
ah bump into the silliest things these

2077.719 --> 2083.489
[Music]

2096.64 --> 2099.64
days

2099.71 --> 2104.8
[Music]

2102.119 --> 2104.8
oh that looks

2113.8 --> 2120.88
nice yeah I'll share

2116.64 --> 2120.8799999999997
that yours not blooming

2125.599 --> 2132.0
though all right so this is

2128.2 --> 2132.0
seeking Star Wars rosemary

2133.04 --> 2139.8
plant thank you for sharing looks great

2136.0 --> 2139.8
though very healthy and

2143.28 --> 2148.28
green mine looks a bit weathered on top

2146.2 --> 2150.56
of the

2148.28 --> 2153.44
looming but I probably should have

2150.56 --> 2155.68
repotted it a bit earlier than I did I

2153.44 --> 2158.7200000000003
just left it throughout the entire

2155.68 --> 2161.52
winter like it was but it's still

2158.72 --> 2161.52
endured

2163.64 --> 2169.319
so but yeah it looks great see sour

2167.52 --> 2172.7599999999998
water

2169.319 --> 2175.88
nice thank you for sharing that it's

2172.76 --> 2180.44
lovely with chicken I bet it

2175.88 --> 2180.44
is oh that sounds really good by the

2181.04 --> 2186.56
way chicken I might have some I'm not

2183.96 --> 2189.56
sure I'm going to have

2186.56 --> 2189.56
tomorrow

2202.28 --> 2206.28
repot it yeah I just did that that

2204.68 --> 2209.64
that's why I showed

2206.28 --> 2213.079
it it's not a huge pot

2209.64 --> 2216.44
but just to see if it's going to have

2213.079 --> 2218.48
some positive influence from that and

2216.44 --> 2222.599
then I might report it into an even

2218.48 --> 2225.8
bigger pot so cuz I did find another one

2222.599 --> 2229.88
of those on the street keep finding like

2225.8 --> 2229.88
big pots which is

2235.44 --> 2241.4
great the people just leaving that out

2239.48 --> 2246.52
on the sidewalk and all that and I'm

2241.4 --> 2249.52
like yeah thanks I'll take that from

2246.52 --> 2249.52
you

2259.18 --> 2262.2599999999998
[Music]

2272.119 --> 2276.44
needs twice the

2274.2 --> 2279.4399999999996
size

2276.44 --> 2279.44
okay

2281.119 --> 2285.76
well I I could do that the pot that I

2283.28 --> 2288.3590000000004
did find is pretty much twice the size

2285.76 --> 2288.3590000000004
it's just

2291.68 --> 2297.68
that I thought I I just take it one

2294.44 --> 2297.68
little step bigger

2306.44 --> 2309.44
first

2336.44 --> 2339.44
e

2340.95 --> 2344.4199999999996
[Music]

2347.839 --> 2352.04
right so I'm going to get my coffee and

2349.48 --> 2355.319
all that I really feel kind of slow

2352.04 --> 2355.319
today I don't know what it

2366.359 --> 2369.359
is

2396.319 --> 2399.319
what

2419.24 --> 2422.839
get my Illuminati C on

2426.319 --> 2429.319
later

2429.92 --> 2436.88
hopefully after a couple of sips of this

2432.76 --> 2436.88
coffee coffee I'll I'll wake up a

2444.68 --> 2450.319
bit I am really enjoying my coffees by

2447.96 --> 2450.319
the way

2451.48 --> 2456.2400000000002
recently without much negative side

2454.04 --> 2459.0
effects

2456.24 --> 2463.4399999999996
too which in a way is surprising because

2459.0 --> 2463.44
I still remember like drinking all that

2463.599 --> 2468.2000000000003
coffee years ago and having all these

2466.4 --> 2470.079
issues with it and I'm I'm really

2468.2 --> 2474.3999999999996
starting to wonder

2470.079 --> 2477.319
like was it the alcohol that was

2474.4 --> 2479.52
like making it hard for me to deal with

2477.319 --> 2479.52
the

2482.319 --> 2488.04
coffee

2484.079 --> 2490.2000000000003
because in response like go he gave me

2488.04 --> 2494.7599999999998
stomach issues and all that and I'm just

2490.2 --> 2494.7599999999998
I've not been having those at

2498.56 --> 2503.119
all oh look who decided to show

2510.16 --> 2514.2
up clutch you want to do the

2516.24 --> 2519.24
honors

2544.76 --> 2549.119

[Music]

2606.119 --> 2609.119
all

2614.24 --> 2620.52
I'm I was almost going to actually

2617.359 --> 2623.52
address the individual it's just that

2620.52 --> 2625.68
every single time they pop up they're so

2623.52 --> 2632.599
incredibly

2625.68 --> 2632.5989999999997
tedious and hypocritical like Beyond

2634.839 --> 2642.04
Comprehension like a pinnacle of gamma

2637.8 --> 2647.52
expression and I'm just

2642.04 --> 2647.52
like there is no way back from that

2656.64 --> 2661.749

2666.04 --> 2669.04

2720.2 --> 2725.2799999999997
[ __ ] and you're

2722.64 --> 2727.7599999999998
continually getting in my face just

2725.28 --> 2731.76
being an insulting piece of

2727.76 --> 2734.599
[ __ ] and then as soon as I like make

2731.76 --> 2734.599
some kind of a

2734.96 --> 2742.359
joke that might even be remotely in your

2739.68 --> 2745.1189999999997
direction you just whine and [ __ ] about

2742.359 --> 2748.64
it nonstop you're such an unbearable

2745.119 --> 2748.6400000000003
piece of [ __ ] scumbag

2749.76 --> 2755.44
dude I can't believe that there's any

2753.24 --> 2759.52
person out there that is just even

2755.44 --> 2762.559
willing to have you in their presence

2759.52 --> 2766.48
ever you're the most obnoxious

2762.559 --> 2766.48
individual I've ever seen on the

2781.64 --> 2785.319
internet so there you

2785.92 --> 2788.92
go

2793.559 --> 2796.1600000000003
I'm going to get my

2815.839 --> 2818.839
Illumina

2845.839 --> 2848.839
for

2856.24 --> 2863.16

2860.839 --> 2866.16
think it

2863.16 --> 2866.16
is

2866.839 --> 2874.0789999999997
just it is just tedious

2871.48 --> 2879.48
like I don't really understand why

2874.079 --> 2879.48
anybody else just leaves any TR of him

2882.16 --> 2886.16
around that's the part I don't

2894.49 --> 2899.2999999999997
[Music]

2905.76 --> 2908.76
get

2915.4 --> 2921.119
right but I mean at this point he's

2918.92 --> 2923.079
basically just being a demon trying to

2921.119 --> 2926.599
fill up the

2923.079 --> 2930.3590000000004
void cuz I'm not like in a flow to talk

2926.599 --> 2930.3590000000004
about a bunch of things right

2933.92 --> 2943.44
now I'm still basically trying trying

2938.04 --> 2946.839
to let the whole ignorance Paradox sink

2943.44 --> 2950.119
in cuz that was a discovery yesterday I

2946.839 --> 2950.119
mean I did discover

2950.62 --> 2953.8199999999997
[Music]

2963.76 --> 2968.48
that and in a way I'd love to like

2966.28 --> 2972.559
basically continue the conversation that

2968.48 --> 2976.28
I had before that particular

2972.559 --> 2979.8390000000004
subject but yeah the the Alchemy has to

2976.28 --> 2982.1600000000003
be there people have to have questions

2979.839 --> 2982.16
about

2988.16 --> 2992.5989999999997
it and I have to like get into it

2995.64 --> 2998.64
again

3009.77 --> 3012.98
[Music]

3019.44 --> 3025.079
yeah also very interesting that teret

3021.599 --> 3025.079
just got it completely

3025.64 --> 3031.4
wrong can't believe I actually said his

3028.16 --> 3033.64
name he says here I'm against bullying

3031.4 --> 3033.64
and

3033.799 --> 3039.2
racism was that my position yesterday

3037.0 --> 3041.28
can anybody in chat here remember the

3039.2 --> 3045.0
first part of yesterday's show it's in

3041.28 --> 3045.0
the title remember my

3053.88 --> 3058.6400000000003
stance so it's just interesting

3059.24 --> 3067.16
how he's like taking an shw route the

3063.599 --> 3068.7200000000003
worst the worst position you could

3067.16 --> 3071.92
possibly

3068.72 --> 3075.8799999999997
take and getting it wrong not even

3071.92 --> 3075.88
picking up on that that's not my

3075.96 --> 3083.799
stance now I am

3080.0 --> 3085.559
anti social justice in pretty much every

3083.799 --> 3091.04
conceivable

3085.559 --> 3091.0400000000004
regard I am the antisocial Justice

3091.2 --> 3094.4399999999996
Warrior an

3096.76 --> 3104.559
anti-marxist I attempt to mirror myself

3100.4 --> 3108.04
in exact opposite way at

3104.559 --> 3108.0400000000004
every possible

3111.72 --> 3114.9599999999996
opportunity as

3115.52 --> 3118.52
sjw

3120.52 --> 3125.88
that's kind of funny though when you say

3122.28 --> 3128.48
it like that antisocial Justice

3125.88 --> 3132.96
Warrior that does sound like chaos but I

3128.48 --> 3132.96
mean social justice Warrior Is

3133.92 --> 3140.96
Like It Is A

3137.079 --> 3143.6800000000003
Lie it is like a Marxist lie it's

3140.96 --> 3143.68
exactly the

3145.52 --> 3148.52
opposite

3152.64 --> 3158.7599999999998
huh okay hello greig

3156.119 --> 3162.2000000000003
brunzel you're booking a hotel for the

3158.76 --> 3164.559
solar eclipse wow okay guess you're

3162.2 --> 3168.52
really enthusiastic about

3164.559 --> 3168.52
that hope you make some good

3175.44 --> 3178.44
footage

3187.839 --> 3192.839
travel 4 hours okay that's not that

3195.96 --> 3200.7200000000003
bad and you still got over a week to go

3203.04 --> 3208.44
so yeah it's on on a Monday

3208.76 --> 3211.079
by

3212.52 --> 3219.44
way I'm a little disappointed that the

3215.799 --> 3225.7599999999998
whole esoteric conspiracy

3219.44 --> 3225.76
theory sector has mention so very

3226.119 --> 3234.6400000000003
little about the uh n eclipse in

3229.599 --> 3234.6400000000003
relation to the St Andrew's

3235.44 --> 3240.7200000000003
cross

3237.52 --> 3243.72
and the references of that se that very

3240.72 --> 3245.64
cross in the Celtic Flags like I'm kind

3243.72 --> 3247.04
of disappointed that I'm the only one

3245.64 --> 3249.68
that's kind of like

3247.04 --> 3251.599
vaguely it is kind of vague it's like oh

3249.68 --> 3254.5589999999997
I'm seeing this connection and I put it

3251.599 --> 3257.0
out and it's like I'm the only

3254.559 --> 3258.3190000000004
one everybody else is just going the

3257.0 --> 3261.4
usual

3258.319 --> 3265.04
route of like gatria and like oh

3261.4 --> 3265.04
Hollywood connection predictive

3265.359 --> 3268.359
programming

3276.119 --> 3280.2000000000003
going through many

3277.76 --> 3287.4
bashville okay fine then you can call it

3280.2 --> 3287.3999999999996
the Nashville eclip if you want guy from

3293.64 --> 3303.359
milavi yeah it's called nineve for

3297.359 --> 3303.359
the specific biblical implications of

3308.04 --> 3317.359
that so it is like a Preferred Choice to

3313.0 --> 3317.359
name it that because that

3317.4 --> 3323.92
emphasizes the

3320.0 --> 3327.2
biblical relation

3323.92 --> 3329.64
and the the potential

3327.2 --> 3332.1189999999997
influence it may have that we suspect it

3329.64 --> 3334.48
may have that it feels like and that we

3332.119 --> 3337.7200000000003
all need a phoenix

3334.48 --> 3338.76
event so by calling it The nve Eclipse

3337.72 --> 3342.0
we

3338.76 --> 3345.3590000000004
emphasize or we direct the energies

3342.0 --> 3348.039
towards an intended goal the Phoenix

3345.359 --> 3351.88
event people call it the N Eclipse

3348.039 --> 3355.4
because they naturally want the energy

3351.88 --> 3357.44
to result in a phoenix event that's what

3355.4 --> 3360.44
people naturally

3357.44 --> 3362.68
do it's their conscious choice to take

3360.44 --> 3362.68
that

3365.64 --> 3370.0
route hey debatable D good see

3373.74 --> 3376.89
[Music]

3380.839 --> 3388.24
you alons Hollands oh really huh

3392.64 --> 3397.48
Nash

3394.64 --> 3399.0789999999997
lips yeah yeah but I mean Nashville

3397.48 --> 3402.64
doesn't really have

3399.079 --> 3407.7200000000003
any Biblical significance now does

3402.64 --> 3407.72
it it's just a very an American

3409.48 --> 3415.2400000000002
name weird though about the six Hollands

3413.119 --> 3420.0
that is a bit

3415.24 --> 3423.319
weird obviously has some personal

3420.0 --> 3423.319
significance for

3427.0 --> 3431.319
me Center FS

3432.48 --> 3438.039
what what's so special about this well

3435.799 --> 3440.7599999999998
if you don't know that by now then

3438.039 --> 3443.2400000000002
obviously you haven't paid any attention

3440.76 --> 3445.28
whatsoever to any of the streams that

3443.24 --> 3448.16
I've done in the last week addressing

3445.28 --> 3448.1600000000003
that Greg brunzel

3461.44 --> 3467.359
what is so special about this

3463.64 --> 3470.359
Eclipse it's a the second part of a

3467.359 --> 3474.48
two-parter reoccurring event that

3470.359 --> 3478.119
specifically ties into the number

3474.48 --> 3478.119
7076 it's a real

3478.48 --> 3484.839
occurring cross very specific type of

3482.039 --> 3488.8390000000004
cross that happens to be the exact type

3484.839 --> 3490.5589999999997
of cross that you find on all Celtic

3488.839 --> 3492.68
Nation

3490.559 --> 3496.88
flags

3492.68 --> 3496.8799999999997
and the flag of the

3501.28 --> 3508.119
Confederacy and it is very tied in with

3505.119 --> 3508.119
the founding of the na

3509.319 --> 3517.319
numerologically and it is just that

3512.039 --> 3519.48
cross which even tells you hints to me

3517.319 --> 3523.92
that there is like a much deeper route

3519.48 --> 3523.92
that precedes colonial

3524.52 --> 3530.599
America it gives me this suspicion like

3527.799 --> 3534.16
there was a Celtic Nation before

3530.599 --> 3537.92
colonial America that was in America and

3534.16 --> 3540.92
that that is where the that freaking St

3537.92 --> 3543.559
Andrews cross that's used in European

3540.92 --> 3545.559
flags in the Celtic Nations is where

3543.559 --> 3548.6400000000003
it's coming from that's where it came

3545.559 --> 3548.6400000000003
from potentially

3549.079 --> 3555.44
originally and then it would be logical

3551.839 --> 3559.92
and very typical if the Catholic

3555.44 --> 3565.039
Church assimilated and tried to hijack

3559.92 --> 3567.2000000000003
that hyper original ancient astrological

3565.039 --> 3570.7200000000003
based symbol

3567.2 --> 3574.96
and grafted it into St

3570.72 --> 3577.4399999999996
Andrew and maybe St Andrew had like some

3574.96 --> 3579.559
Celtic connections even and basically

3577.44 --> 3580.64
like okay I'm going to end well I'm

3579.559 --> 3585.559
going to

3580.64 --> 3589.16
end in the Celtic way or something like

3585.559 --> 3591.52
that right so there is just this giant

3589.16 --> 3594.52
esoteric thing that has been staring me

3591.52 --> 3594.52
in the face for a

3595.039 --> 3598.039
while

3656.0 --> 3663.799
EV a mix of them in Mid America and West

3660.52 --> 3666.599
America and the what we now know as the

3663.799 --> 3668.2
Native American tribes basically in

3666.599 --> 3672.52
between it

3668.2 --> 3674.72
all spread out probably living

3672.52 --> 3676.119
alongside so the Native American would

3674.72 --> 3679.0789999999997
have been

3676.119 --> 3681.119
like comparable to like the

3679.079 --> 3683.44
Gypsies in

3681.119 --> 3687.559
Europe Native Americans could have been

3683.44 --> 3689.7200000000003
like the gypsies of the Amer Amer while

3687.559 --> 3692.4
there were Nations while there were more

3689.72 --> 3695.24
City like environments a bit of an

3692.4 --> 3700.88
Empire of its own which would have been

3695.24 --> 3700.8799999999997
Celtic and tartarian in the

3707.0 --> 3713.16
west

3708.52 --> 3714.92
what s selty clips

3713.16 --> 3716.48
okay

3714.92 --> 3719.64
sure

3716.48 --> 3722.64
copyright me

3719.64 --> 3722.64
uh

3724.92 --> 3730.92
no but yeah you could call it the Celtic

3728.2 --> 3734.52
Eclipse it's kind of funny you would

3730.92 --> 3738.839
call it Celtic clips that is like me

3734.52 --> 3738.839
calling the anti Equator the anti

3739.88 --> 3744.92
equator but Kelty Clips does that sounds

3743.88 --> 3747.92
kind of

3744.92 --> 3747.92
clipped

3748.119 --> 3753.079
what did you find out about the three

3749.76 --> 3753.079
body problem the b

3758.76 --> 3766.5200000000004
d sounds like a lot of effort to make it

3762.16 --> 3770.5989999999997
more interesting yeah or astrological

3766.52 --> 3773.96
events that reoccur are so

3770.599 --> 3776.88
ancient that they basically

3773.96 --> 3780.76
survive the repeated

3776.88 --> 3782.7200000000003
arrival and destruction of Empires over

3780.76 --> 3785.7200000000003
over the

3782.72 --> 3785.72
Millennia

3788.16 --> 3792.68
yeah and that because of that through

3791.92 --> 3795.48
the

3792.68 --> 3798.96
astrology we can almost like a mirror

3795.48 --> 3802.839
into a completely routed and destroyed

3798.96 --> 3805.279
past still potentially reconstruct what

3802.839 --> 3807.68
would have been there yeah and that's

3805.279 --> 3810.599
what I'm doing right now because

3807.68 --> 3812.52
obviously precolonial American history

3810.599 --> 3816.3590000000004
has been completely

3812.52 --> 3820.0
destroyed officially replaced obviously

3816.359 --> 3820.0
like blatantly

3820.2 --> 3826.0
obviously but that doesn't mean that it

3823.119 --> 3826.0
that it was never

3834.839 --> 3837.839
there

3847.039 --> 3851.039
Jesus okay de bable that's messed

3853.68 --> 3859.24
up

3855.88 --> 3860.4
what holy [ __ ] that is really crazy

3859.24 --> 3864.0389999999998
debatable

3860.4 --> 3864.039
D are you for

3864.76 --> 3867.76
real

3872.92 --> 3876.48
what are you

3877.48 --> 3884.17
serious damn talk about a three body

3881.04 --> 3884.17
[Music]

3886.91 --> 3892.0789999999997
[Music]

3888.039 --> 3894.559
problem that is that is

3892.079 --> 3896.92
insane that is like the craziest

3894.559 --> 3898.92
backstory I've ever heard

3896.92 --> 3900.7200000000003
of any series debatable thanks for

3898.92 --> 3904.359
sharing that do do you have any sources

3900.72 --> 3904.359
for that that is

3923.559 --> 3930.799
crazy yeah

3926.64 --> 3933.1189999999997
it's interesting ter still there it's

3930.799 --> 3936.2
such a joke I'm talking about astrology

3933.119 --> 3939.799
well why don't you do better you [ __ ]

3936.2 --> 3942.279
stalking piece of [ __ ] yeah why don't

3939.799 --> 3944.72
you do something instead of whining and

3942.279 --> 3947.4
complaining about how somebody else is

3944.72 --> 3949.5989999999997
doing it wrong cuz that's all we ever

3947.4 --> 3950.88
get to see of you yeah why don't you do

3949.599 --> 3953.599
something for

3950.88 --> 3957.6400000000003
yourself why you come out of the Shadows

3953.599 --> 3957.6400000000003
show your face

3960.119 --> 3964.88
yeah if you think it's all so bad why

3962.88 --> 3967.279
didn't you stop stalking that which you

3964.88 --> 3969.6800000000003
think is so bad and make something

3967.279 --> 3973.68
that's better instead of whining and

3969.68 --> 3973.68
bitching all the time for

3976.64 --> 3982.839
months who who the [ __ ] you think I'm

3979.4 --> 3982.839
talking about did Gary do

3983.559 --> 3988.7200000000003
music the troll guy that keeps making

3986.68 --> 3990.7599999999998
new [ __ ] suck accounts just to be

3988.72 --> 3994.359
whiny and [ __ ] all the time and try to

3990.76 --> 3994.3590000000004
get in my face everywhere I

3998.24 --> 4004.0389999999998
go I mean if he keeps this up I am going

4001.24 --> 4007.16
to start calling him gollem because that

4004.039 --> 4009.4
is like an eerie resemblance at this

4007.16 --> 4012.48
point didn't see yeah because you don't

4009.4 --> 4017.039
have a wrench be glad you didn't see

4012.48 --> 4020.64
it's all crap it's all just crap

4017.039 --> 4023.4
I mean his insults aren't even like

4020.64 --> 4026.5589999999997
creative or remotely

4023.4 --> 4029.7200000000003
enjoyable from a creative perspective

4026.559 --> 4033.1600000000003
it's all tedious and lame everything

4029.72 --> 4033.16
that comes out of him is just

4037.44 --> 4043.599
[ __ ] I guess you know what they say [ __ ]

4041.24 --> 4047.5589999999997
in [ __ ]

4043.599 --> 4047.559
out right

4048.7 --> 4051.83
[Music]

4055.9 --> 4059.03
[Music]

4069.52 --> 4074.799
okay producer but debatable D are you

4072.799 --> 4077.7599999999998
talking about the book then not about

4074.799 --> 4080.24
the Ser not about the the Hollywood

4077.76 --> 4083.1600000000003
production you're talking about the

4080.24 --> 4083.16
writer of the

4084.76 --> 4094.5200000000004
book I don't know debatable D it's no

4091.76 --> 4096.92
it I wouldn't want to associate

4094.52 --> 4099.359
something that is as

4096.92 --> 4102.4
fascinating as that

4099.359 --> 4107.52
movie to him I don't even know where he

4102.4 --> 4107.5199999999995
got it from and who cares

4109.08 --> 4114.96
yeah but uh if somebody wants the care

4112.48 --> 4117.44
then maybe they should start doing their

4114.96 --> 4118.88
own stream where they get on the camera

4117.44 --> 4123.04
show their

4118.88 --> 4123.04
faces and maybe

4123.159 --> 4128.4
explain they're so much better than than

4126.4 --> 4131.2789999999995
another individual that they want to

4128.4 --> 4131.2789999999995
stalk for

4132.6 --> 4138.04
months you thought it was fet well

4135.04 --> 4141.48
that's what the trolls call themselves

4138.04 --> 4145.199
now on their side so yeah if you see a

4141.48 --> 4145.199
fet just going to kick it

4145.239 --> 4150.04
out that's what they call themselves now

4164.44 --> 4167.44
apparently

4167.839 --> 4175.6
oh debatable okay so debatable it was

4170.799 --> 4175.6
actually about the Netflix series

4178.159 --> 4182.5199999999995
then this the the guy was confused Yes

4181.6 --> 4186.400000000001
Man

4182.52 --> 4190.4800000000005
goth although it's not the only one it's

4186.4 --> 4190.48
just the most tedious

4193.8 --> 4199.679
one I got a hold range of trolls that

4196.52 --> 4202.8
are continually on my ass for some

4199.679 --> 4206.159
reason and they all

4202.8 --> 4210.6
suck but this one is like by far the

4206.159 --> 4210.599999999999
most tedious one the most recognizable

4224.36 --> 4227.36
one

4228.56 --> 4233.400000000001
and I didn't am man go but I didn't

4230.92 --> 4235.28
think you were

4233.4 --> 4238.0
overtly that

4235.28 --> 4240.96
individual there's other individuals too

4238.0 --> 4245.56
some of which can actually

4240.96 --> 4249.12
act and somewhat pretend to be another

4245.56 --> 4249.120000000001
individual halfway

4250.04 --> 4254.08
competent this guy

4254.32 --> 4258.4
can't

4255.88 --> 4262.6
he really is like a Gollum I

4258.4 --> 4266.239
mean Gollum ain't G to act like he's

4262.6 --> 4269.8
something else am I right like nobody

4266.239 --> 4271.759999999999
would ever fall for that he's too

4269.8 --> 4277.12
recognizable

4271.76 --> 4277.12
too grounded in his specific

4277.88 --> 4280.88
ways

4283.48 --> 4289.678999999999
right but there's plenty of other guys

4286.64 --> 4293.780000000001
thank you for your kind words what I

4289.679 --> 4296.859
don't know how that's kind words but

4293.78 --> 4296.8589999999995
[Music]

4298.52 --> 4304.84
sure I mean to be fair I can't exclude

4302.0 --> 4309.04
any of you non- wrenched people not to

4304.84 --> 4311.400000000001
be one of those trolls going on a longer

4309.04 --> 4314.32
type of Route CU they all just play a

4311.4 --> 4317.5599999999995
game guys for those that are actually

4314.32 --> 4318.88
tuning in right now or for like in the

4317.56 --> 4323.2390000000005
last week or

4318.88 --> 4325.84
month they've been doing this for over 2

4323.239 --> 4328.199
years

4325.84 --> 4331.88
okay

4328.199 --> 4334.239
so I'm always expecting every single one

4331.88 --> 4336.76
of you to

4334.239 --> 4339.28
subtly throw off their

4336.76 --> 4343.4800000000005
cloak and reveal themselves to be a

4339.28 --> 4343.48
troll cuz that's just what

4344.239 --> 4347.239
happens

4350.639 --> 4354.6
Charlie I'm sure it will be very

4356.0 --> 4363.88
sad but I'm pretty sure that he's going

4359.12 --> 4363.88
to be a sad individual no matter what

4366.43 --> 4369.499000000001
[Music]

4372.12 --> 4377.239
happens they all

4374.239 --> 4377.239
are

4380.92 --> 4386.1990000000005
I mean I'm losing like I there's a long

4383.52 --> 4386.1990000000005
list of these

4386.719 --> 4394.4
individuals Charlie Welch them versus

4389.8 --> 4394.400000000001
them versus US jamc

4397.05 --> 4402.159000000001
[Music]

4400.199 --> 4404.5599999999995
level the others are going to be

4402.159 --> 4406.879999999999
insulted that I can't think of their

4404.56 --> 4409.159000000001
name right now now but I mean yeah

4406.88 --> 4409.159000000001
there's

4409.199 --> 4414.08
more and they all clog up together like

4412.36 --> 4418.639
some kind of orc

4414.08 --> 4423.4
horde gathering in

4418.639 --> 4427.159000000001
Mordor attempting raids every now and

4423.4 --> 4427.159
then falling out of

4427.6 --> 4433.0
Minit but I mean like it's not going to

4430.56 --> 4433.0
work

4434.12 --> 4437.12
though

4437.92 --> 4442.56
right and you can try to infiltrate all

4439.6 --> 4446.1990000000005
you like like I'll just go with the

4442.56 --> 4449.719
behavior like you're not going to damage

4446.199 --> 4452.159
Me by disappointing me turning out that

4449.719 --> 4456.52
some person in the chat that I thought

4452.159 --> 4458.96
was halfway amusing or doable or I would

4456.52 --> 4461.159000000001
be like oh that that maybe is a nice

4458.96 --> 4463.76
person and they turn out oh I was a

4461.159 --> 4467.12
troll all the time like it's not going

4463.76 --> 4467.12
to hurt me anymore

4467.48 --> 4472.4
I know it's an occupational hazard it's

4469.76 --> 4474.280000000001
like yeah there's just troll infiltrants

4472.4 --> 4477.08
all the time and people that I'm like

4474.28 --> 4480.08
getting used to will pop out to be like

4477.08 --> 4482.92
ah I was a demon yeah

4480.08 --> 4486.32
okay it's not going to damage me or

4482.92 --> 4489.36
dissuade me or even Slow Me Down anymore

4486.32 --> 4492.36
I'm just just telling

4489.36 --> 4492.36
you

4492.56 --> 4497.04
yeah it just is what it is

4498.84 --> 4507.8
there's nothing I can really do about it

4503.719 --> 4510.8
except not let it influence me in any

4507.8 --> 4513.4800000000005
negative way and that is that is what

4510.8 --> 4513.4800000000005
I'm focusing

4514.12 --> 4520.8
on because that's the most successful

4518.199 --> 4523.799999999999
strategy

4520.8 --> 4526.12
yeah I mean bacteria parasites are

4523.8 --> 4529.0
always going to be there

4526.12 --> 4531.04
that you you can't get them away you

4529.0 --> 4533.44
can't just eradicate

4531.04 --> 4538.0
them but you

4533.44 --> 4541.4
can live in a way that they're not going

4538.0 --> 4543.12
to be able to damage you or bother you

4541.4 --> 4545.92
just live

4543.12 --> 4547.679
healthier

4545.92 --> 4551.159
better

4547.679 --> 4554.8
wiser and then they can just be out

4551.159 --> 4557.04
there and even fulfill a function to a

4554.8 --> 4557.04
degree

4559.28 --> 4564.4
a function that will elude them CU they

4562.36 --> 4566.599999999999
think they have their

4564.4 --> 4569.638999999999
function and that function in their

4566.6 --> 4572.159000000001
minds lies where their minds are at but

4569.639 --> 4574.1990000000005
that's not really a function in the

4572.159 --> 4577.36
bigger picture it's

4574.199 --> 4582.32
just function assigned to them by their

4577.36 --> 4584.32
egos but just by being what they are in

4582.32 --> 4586.28
the grand scheme of things does fulfill

4584.32 --> 4589.799999999999
a function

4586.28 --> 4589.8
and it's up to me to see

4590.199 --> 4596.759999999999
that it's like a Scooby-Doo episode

4592.84 --> 4600.4400000000005
right it is clutch that is uncanny that

4596.76 --> 4600.4400000000005
it really is like that isn't

4600.96 --> 4605.8
it how freaking corny is that but you're

4603.92 --> 4607.88
totally right it is like a freaking

4605.8 --> 4609.8
Scooby-Doo episode and the monster takes

4607.88 --> 4613.719
off the mask it really

4609.8 --> 4617.96
is and I'm like okay here we go again

4613.719 --> 4621.32
another Scooby-Doo reveal oh

4617.96 --> 4624.56
goody anyway I'm going to take a bite

4621.32 --> 4627.32
out of my Illuminati how dare me how

4624.56 --> 4627.320000000001
dare me do

4629.04 --> 4634.719
that how dare me how dare Arwin always

4632.56 --> 4638.320000000001
hold up his Illuminati kasan in front of

4634.719 --> 4640.56
his right eye that means he's secretly

4638.32 --> 4643.92
associated with the

4640.56 --> 4647.6
Antichrist how dare you

4643.92 --> 4647.6
Arwin anyway

4669.96 --> 4673.84
cheers yeah debatable d i I warned you

4672.88 --> 4676.84
about

4673.84 --> 4676.84
it

4678.36 --> 4683.12
that frighter sequence is like one of

4680.679 --> 4685.92
the freakiest things I've ever seen in

4683.12 --> 4688.239
cinema like that scared the [ __ ] out of

4685.92 --> 4688.2390000000005

4721.56 --> 4725.8
intro to the movie Ghost Ship oh

yeah except that movie was complete

4733.84 --> 4736.84
[ __ ]

4737.62 --> 4740.8589999999995
[Music]

4755.6 --> 4762.679
yeah but especially like the aftermath

4759.08 --> 4767.28
like how the ship basically fell apart

4762.679 --> 4767.28
that thing that's like one of the most

4767.8 --> 4773.400000000001
unique things I've ever seen you must

4771.199 --> 4777.759999999999
agree with that

4773.4 --> 4777.759999999999
like that is just like

4780.639 --> 4789.400000000001
wow like also the CGI crew which would

4785.32 --> 4792.84
have had some architectural supervision

4789.4 --> 4796.48
about it like that's really impressive

4792.84 --> 4798.52
the way they

4796.48 --> 4801.44
the way that

4798.52 --> 4806.080000000001
ended the collapse I mean that's like

4801.44 --> 4806.08
wow nobody's ever seen anything like

4806.36 --> 4814.0
that come on with the notifications of

4810.719 --> 4814.0

4852.12 --> 4858.4

4858.4 --> 4862.32
agenda billboard that's how I use

4861.0 --> 4865.239

4868.679 --> 4876.36
notifications of YouTube is being weird

4872.52 --> 4880.320000000001

4980.44 --> 4986.12
mood today and that's

4983.48 --> 4987.94
great it's a kind of an in between day

4986.12 --> 4989.159
isn't

4987.94 --> 4993.48
[Music]

4989.159 --> 4999.12
it yesterday Good Friday tomorrow

4993.48 --> 4999.12
Easter what is today it's the in between

5003.52 --> 5006.52
day

5009.54 --> 5012.64
[Music]

5033.44 --> 5036.44
h

5039.719 --> 5044.76
dropped some new paintings

5041.76 --> 5044.76
off

5048.44 --> 5052.48
cool does that include the one that you

5051.0 --> 5055.92
showed that

5052.48 --> 5055.919999999999
little picture

5063.44 --> 5068.04
of in the early bird chat on

5071.639 --> 5076.719
Thursday you don't feel you're good

5073.92 --> 5076.719
enough at your

5078.56 --> 5085.96
what

5081.36 --> 5085.96
well why would you feel that

5087.0 --> 5092.28
and I'm afraid I can't really help you

5089.719 --> 5095.04
with that duper considering

5092.28 --> 5098.119
that you have this nonis disclosure

5095.04 --> 5101.199
agreement about your job so I wouldn't

5098.119 --> 5105.08
be able to tell whether you are not good

5101.199 --> 5108.919999999999
enough for your job because I don't know

5105.08 --> 5108.92
what your job is and you can't tell

5112.8 --> 5117.320000000001
me so you got a problem

5123.36 --> 5126.36
there

5146.84 --> 5151.159000000001
I'm afraid you're going to have to

5148.0 --> 5151.159
figure that one out

5153.32 --> 5159.5199999999995
yourself

5155.88 --> 5159.52
[Music]

5162.56 --> 5171.04
although you could perhaps

5166.0 --> 5173.76
share non-specific orientation details

5171.04 --> 5175.08
about the type of thing that it is

5173.76 --> 5179.119000000001
you're

5175.08 --> 5183.32
doing without hinting at anything

5179.119 --> 5185.679
specific and then relate your perceived

5183.32 --> 5187.599999999999
incompetency

5185.679 --> 5191.92
in relation to

5187.6 --> 5191.92
that general direction of the

5193.0 --> 5199.04
activity but you'll have to be very

5195.84 --> 5201.2390000000005
careful wording yourself when you do it

5199.04 --> 5204.4
or you might get into

5201.239 --> 5207.04
trouble or maybe it is the secrecy part

5204.4 --> 5209.719
itself the nondisclosure agreement

5207.04 --> 5212.32
secrecy that is the trouble with it and

5209.719 --> 5215.4800000000005
that you actually have inner nature to

5212.32 --> 5219.5199999999995
share a lot to try to process things

5215.48 --> 5219.5199999999995
maybe that is the trouble itself who

5220.76 --> 5225.08
knows you're going to have to figure it

5222.88 --> 5225.08
out

5225.96 --> 5232.719
duper and have to figure out what's the

5228.199 --> 5232.719
best course of action for you in your

5239.199 --> 5243.239
predicament there's no problem with

5241.32 --> 5245.88
Rogan's Coastal

5243.239 --> 5247.04
watch there's no problem when you spell

5245.88 --> 5251.0
it

5247.04 --> 5251.0
right like you're doing right

5253.76 --> 5258.88
now just remember there's no I in

5259.28 --> 5262.28
Rogan

5273.239 --> 5276.239
y

5283.91 --> 5287.0599999999995
[Music]

5303.159 --> 5306.159
for

5308.66 --> 5311.83
[Applause]

5312.639 --> 5316.92
well the coffee certainly did wake me

5316.96 --> 5324.96
up the Illuminati cran hit the

5320.4 --> 5324.96
spot so I do feel ready to

5333.119 --> 5336.119
go

5357.44 --> 5363.119
ass simulation into Human Society is

5360.199 --> 5366.119
that the non-disclosure agreement

5363.119 --> 5366.119
clutch

5368.04 --> 5377.5199999999995
okay duper yeah I we know you're a robot

5373.84 --> 5380.32
AI that is specifically made unaware

5377.52 --> 5384.1990000000005
that they're a robot we got a job for

5380.32 --> 5388.88
you you have to assimilate into Human

5384.199 --> 5391.4
Society but that detail about the

5388.88 --> 5393.639
mission is part of a non-disclosure

5391.4 --> 5395.0
agreement so you have to assimilate into

5393.639 --> 5397.159000000001
society

5395.0 --> 5400.679
be more humanlike but you can't tell

5397.159 --> 5403.199
anybody that that is what you're

5400.679 --> 5405.92
doing gets a little complicated when you

5403.199 --> 5405.919999999999
think of it like

5413.48 --> 5418.159
that yes and of course duper don't worry

5416.159 --> 5421.96
I don't really think you're a

5418.159 --> 5423.599999999999
robot just referencing back to when is

5421.96 --> 5426.2390000000005
it now a couple of weeks ago that show

5423.6 --> 5427.96
we did where we speculated if dupons was

5426.239 --> 5430.5199999999995
a

5427.96 --> 5433.04
robot it's a bit of a running joke don't

5430.52 --> 5433.040000000001
worry about

5453.04 --> 5456.04
it

5465.52 --> 5468.719
you're not convinced

5469.56 --> 5477.56
yet Terminator the Dupo SC this is that

5474.08 --> 5477.5599999999995
is just

5482.96 --> 5487.08
silly

5485.28 --> 5488.5599999999995
seems everyone is more knowledgeable

5487.08 --> 5491.239
than

5488.56 --> 5493.6
you well that's kind of funny that you

5491.239 --> 5493.599999999999
say

5493.639 --> 5498.4800000000005
that

5495.84 --> 5499.8
because if you're just noticing

5498.48 --> 5502.32
knowledge in

5499.8 --> 5506.76
others but then you

5502.32 --> 5509.159
still emphasize your social perceived

5506.76 --> 5512.92
vantage point in the middle of your

5509.159 --> 5515.759999999999
perception of knowledge in other

5512.92 --> 5518.159
people

5515.76 --> 5522.52
then that's your

5518.159 --> 5522.5199999999995
mistake the mistake is that you

5524.6 --> 5531.56
emphasize your perceived knowledge in

5527.36 --> 5531.5599999999995
the face of other people's perceived

5535.0 --> 5541.88
knowledge but what if you just realize

5537.719 --> 5541.88
that a wise man knows

5542.92 --> 5547.84
nothing

5545.32 --> 5551.199
that the more aware you are the more you

5547.84 --> 5554.08
are aware of how little you know in

5551.199 --> 5555.96
relation to what really exists and at

5554.08 --> 5559.119
some point you might even evolve that to

5555.96 --> 5562.719
the point where you start to realize

5559.119 --> 5568.5199999999995
that knowledge is not something that

5562.719 --> 5568.52
people really have they just tap into

5572.28 --> 5575.84
it like

5577.679 --> 5581.119
knowledge is just something you

5585.119 --> 5594.4
do like everybody you meet always knows

5590.639 --> 5598.36
things that you seemingly don't

5594.4 --> 5598.36
know and that includes

5599.119 --> 5604.599999999999
myself why because they other

5602.159 --> 5607.119
people they're

5604.6 --> 5609.280000000001
in another development in another

5607.119 --> 5613.5599999999995
Direction other Focus points and so they

5609.28 --> 5617.84
will see things that you can't

5613.56 --> 5619.400000000001
see but you can see that they see things

5617.84 --> 5621.639
that you can't

5619.4 --> 5624.48
see right so that's

5621.639 --> 5627.1990000000005
something so with that

5624.48 --> 5629.239
perception just be happy that you can

5627.199 --> 5630.5199999999995
see that other people see things that

5629.239 --> 5633.32
you can't

5630.52 --> 5634.88
see why don't you just take the value of

5633.32 --> 5637.28
that

5634.88 --> 5639.6
be glad that you can see that other

5637.28 --> 5641.5199999999995
people can see things that you can't see

5639.6 --> 5645.320000000001
and just take it instead of

5641.52 --> 5648.8
emphasizing but I don't see that what

5645.32 --> 5651.159
are you supposed to be able to see

5648.8 --> 5654.92
everything see the things that other

5651.159 --> 5654.92
people all see and

5655.52 --> 5661.4800000000005
more then what's going to be left for

5658.639 --> 5662.76
you as a motivation to interact with

5661.48 --> 5665.08
other

5662.76 --> 5667.76
people

5665.08 --> 5670.88
if you already know everything they

5667.76 --> 5674.0
know ever thought of

5670.88 --> 5678.96
that maybe it's a

5674.0 --> 5681.52
gift that you don't always know what

5678.96 --> 5681.52
other people

5683.32 --> 5690.36
know because now there is a reason for

5686.719 --> 5691.2390000000005
you to interact with the other people to

5690.36 --> 5695.719
try

5691.239 --> 5695.718999999999
to gain some of that knowledge

5695.88 --> 5699.1990000000005
there's a motivational Factor now ever

5698.239 --> 5703.44
thought of

5699.199 --> 5703.44
that I do I think of those

5722.719 --> 5729.84
things

5725.52 --> 5729.84
ah a man go wow you remembered my

5730.04 --> 5735.159
quote Oh you actually improved on that

5733.119 --> 5738.159
that's that's

5735.159 --> 5738.159
interesting

5740.36 --> 5746.08
huh oh you I didn't expect that that's

5744.56 --> 5747.280000000001
that's interesting it's a very good way

5746.08 --> 5751.0
to say

5747.28 --> 5753.84
it wise man knows that true wisdom lies

5751.0 --> 5755.679
not in the accumulation of knowledge the

5753.84 --> 5757.96
awareness of the vastness of what

5755.679 --> 5757.96
remains

5759.52 --> 5762.52
unknown

5765.32 --> 5771.199
right so don't

5768.679 --> 5774.32
emphasize that you don't know anything

5771.199 --> 5778.119
in in the face of the vastness of all

5774.32 --> 5780.44
knowledge but learn more about what you

5778.119 --> 5780.44
can

5780.679 --> 5788.2390000000005
know so that you'll be more conscious

5785.119 --> 5788.239
about what you can't

5788.76 --> 5791.76
know

5798.96 --> 5805.96
brilliant right and it's also about

5801.8 --> 5809.04
accepting the big part of that thing in

5805.96 --> 5811.679
in a ever growing motivation that you

5809.04 --> 5814.719
always have to like grow and assimilate

5811.679 --> 5816.36
more understanding is that there are

5814.719 --> 5820.36
things that you're

5816.36 --> 5823.28
like that you're not supposed to know

5820.36 --> 5825.4
that are an unknown for a functional

5823.28 --> 5829.759999999999
reason and

5825.4 --> 5833.599999999999
that you shouldn't be like a

5829.76 --> 5836.159000000001
computer putting everything on the same

5833.6 --> 5838.679
line and then just assume that you're

5836.159 --> 5841.48
supposed to know that which remains

5838.679 --> 5844.04
unknown sometimes there is an unknown

5841.48 --> 5845.44
that is unknown for a reason for a

5844.04 --> 5850.84
functional

5845.44 --> 5850.839999999999
contrast for an in the moment

5853.52 --> 5860.599
balance so it's like as a wizard as

5858.119 --> 5863.96
drank the master knowledge and learning

5860.599 --> 5867.2390000000005
more you have to some at some point

5863.96 --> 5867.2390000000005
accept that there are things

5867.28 --> 5872.0
that that you're not supposed to

5872.36 --> 5877.88
know that trying to figure out certain

5875.56 --> 5883.88
things will impede

5877.88 --> 5883.88
you from learning more about the

5902.52 --> 5905.52
rest

5909.92 --> 5915.08
and that and an interesting way to

5912.04 --> 5917.679
approach that would

5915.08 --> 5919.639
be sometimes you can ask the wrong

5917.679 --> 5925.119
question how would you

5919.639 --> 5925.119
know by realizing what the answer would

5925.56 --> 5931.320000000001
be and then what the answer would do to

5932.199 --> 5939.4
you you know you're asking the right

5935.28 --> 5942.44
question by simulating what the answer

5939.4 --> 5944.679
is likely to be like and then figuring

5942.44 --> 5947.839999999999
out the influence of the

5944.679 --> 5952.0
answer and if the influence is

5947.84 --> 5956.08
positive and energizing growing then you

5952.0 --> 5956.08
know you're going to ask the right

5962.44 --> 5965.44
question

5989.76 --> 5996.4800000000005
question about things in the job yeah

5994.28 --> 5996.48
well

5998.56 --> 6004.360000000001
duper I'm afraid we can't really help

6001.679 --> 6006.84
you with that

6004.36 --> 6009.5599999999995
part you're going to have to figure it

6006.84 --> 6013.76
out and hey if it's really that

6009.56 --> 6015.360000000001
egregious or terrible overtly then you

6013.76 --> 6018.119000000001
might have to figure out whether you're

6015.36 --> 6020.44
going to bail on it or maybe even like

6018.119 --> 6025.36
become a whistleblower or

6020.44 --> 6025.36
something but uh

6026.48 --> 6030.44
you're just going to have to figure that

6028.119 --> 6030.44
out

6052.32 --> 6055.32
yourself

6057.48 --> 6062.4
asking questions is a healthy habit yeah

6060.32 --> 6066.759999999999
but only if you're willing

6062.4 --> 6066.759999999999
to adapt

6068.76 --> 6074.159000000001
to to the res yeah to the consequences

6072.32 --> 6076.679
of asking the questions not even the

6074.159 --> 6080.5599999999995
result not even the

6076.679 --> 6082.92
answer it's about like

6080.56 --> 6083.84
learning how you're going in the right

6082.92 --> 6087.52
direction

6083.84 --> 6091.96
like asking a question should be about

6087.52 --> 6091.96
the influence that the answer will

6100.76 --> 6107.599
have it's like asking about the

6105.28 --> 6110.119
darkness if you're going to ask about

6107.599 --> 6111.92
the darkness then you know that there's

6110.119 --> 6113.88
only going to be a limited amount of

6111.92 --> 6115.1990000000005
things that can roll out of that

6113.88 --> 6119.36
and that

6115.199 --> 6122.08
is Doom or deflecting the

6119.36 --> 6126.4
darkness so it's not going to be a net

6122.08 --> 6126.4
positive result either way you

6127.28 --> 6133.36
see you know logically what the

6129.88 --> 6136.159000000001
direction is going to take energy wise

6133.36 --> 6139.48
of the answer like you can predict that

6136.159 --> 6139.48
you can micro

6140.8 --> 6145.2390000000005
simulated you can feel it out

6146.48 --> 6150.718999999999
right so if you ask a question realize

6149.639 --> 6155.2390000000005
what

6150.719 --> 6155.2390000000005
directions the answers can possibly

6155.679 --> 6161.599
take right it's not just about the

6158.159 --> 6164.239
information it's also about the energies

6161.599 --> 6169.08
that carry the person and the

6164.239 --> 6169.08
conversation it's social and emotional

6170.239 --> 6177.0
influences like that is a factor that

6173.56 --> 6180.4800000000005
also has a

6177.0 --> 6184.76
role outside of the literal

6180.48 --> 6184.759999999999
information that is part of the

6202.159 --> 6207.08
question

6205.04 --> 6209.639
right there's asking the question and

6207.08 --> 6209.639
then there's

6211.08 --> 6215.44
the the

6212.84 --> 6219.88
consequence of having the question

6215.44 --> 6219.879999999999
answered what direction will that

6222.239 --> 6229.718999999999
take do you want that direction to be

6227.28 --> 6231.04
taken where do you want to maneuver the

6229.719 --> 6234.8
energies

6231.04 --> 6236.5199999999995
to into the darkness into the thrilling

6234.8 --> 6241.360000000001
combative

6236.52 --> 6241.360000000001
polarized or do you want the opposite of

6255.76 --> 6261.96
that as the write questions and the

6258.96 --> 6261.96
answers reveal

6262.119 --> 6265.119
themselves

6270.44 --> 6278.0
right and it goes so far a man go that

6275.04 --> 6282.96
sometimes asking the right

6278.0 --> 6285.44
questions like literally reveals the

6282.96 --> 6287.599
answers not even from the person you're

6285.44 --> 6288.799999999999
asking the question sometimes I ask a

6287.599 --> 6291.360000000001
question to

6288.8 --> 6294.400000000001
somebody they don't know how to answer

6291.36 --> 6297.4
it but then I figure out how to answer

6294.4 --> 6298.36
it but that only worked because there

6297.4 --> 6301.879999999999
was

6298.36 --> 6304.0
a a dual situation where I asked the

6301.88 --> 6307.8
question to somebody else they couldn't

6304.0 --> 6312.32
answer but because I was in that

6307.8 --> 6315.56
operation I can then suddenly answer

6312.32 --> 6319.32
myself well if I didn't ask the question

6315.56 --> 6322.159000000001
to somebody else then I the the

6319.32 --> 6326.159
spiritual Alchemy wouldn't have been

6322.159 --> 6329.679
there for me to be able to answer my own

6326.159 --> 6332.199
question yeah in other words sometimes

6329.679 --> 6335.599
you really need to talk to somebody else

6332.199 --> 6338.759999999999
to figure things out just talking to

6335.599 --> 6344.679
yourself without anybody else doesn't do

6338.76 --> 6350.8
that you need somebody else to talk

6344.679 --> 6354.719
to there needs to be a a two individual

6350.8 --> 6360.92
interaction in order for the spiritual

6354.719 --> 6360.92
Alchemy to find a complete cycle to work

6362.8 --> 6368.08
properly right and sometimes that person

6366.36 --> 6373.48
can even be a

6368.08 --> 6373.48
fool can be a almost mindless

6381.96 --> 6384.96
surrogate

6387.76 --> 6392.08
sometimes people call me the wrong name

6389.88 --> 6392.08
I

6401.36 --> 6408.0
feel right duper yeah i' I've seen that

6404.599 --> 6413.88
now that is like a slight form of autism

6408.0 --> 6417.32
indeed but it's like uh an overt

6413.88 --> 6417.32
like heightened sense of

6422.719 --> 6428.0
self-awareness it's like a feeling of

6425.4 --> 6429.598999999999
awkwardness about yourself but it is

6428.0 --> 6432.48
routed

6429.599 --> 6434.92
in self-awareness that is being

6432.48 --> 6437.0
overemphasized because technically you

6434.92 --> 6441.119
shouldn't be

6437.0 --> 6444.92
concerned about how you come off how you

6441.119 --> 6444.92
come across like that

6445.119 --> 6451.679
like maybe you are awkward in a way or

6450.119 --> 6454.04
strange

6451.679 --> 6457.88
but why is that a

6454.04 --> 6462.159
problem maybe that's just you maybe that

6457.88 --> 6464.2390000000005
is your unique being that needs to

6462.159 --> 6466.5199999999995
express itself like

6464.239 --> 6471.239
that despite your

6466.52 --> 6471.2390000000005
own perceived objections against

6471.84 --> 6478.4800000000005
it right perhaps you're falsely judging

6484.04 --> 6489.04
yourself and hey if people call you the

6486.44 --> 6492.0
wrong name then perhaps then you

6489.04 --> 6494.36
should stick up for yourself and say

6492.0 --> 6496.599
that's not my name this is my name

6494.36 --> 6499.88
please say it

6496.599 --> 6502.719
right if they keep

6499.88 --> 6504.159000000001
persisting yeah you have to stick up for

6502.719 --> 6507.88
it yourself a lot of the time when

6504.159 --> 6507.879999999999
people get it wrong it's a

6508.52 --> 6515.8
fluke see it as helping them to correct

6512.639 --> 6519.36
themselves in relation to

6515.8 --> 6521.96
you don't just see it as like oh they

6519.36 --> 6526.08
they're doing it wrong just to get to me

6521.96 --> 6528.76
or to test me if I'm weak that is a

6526.08 --> 6531.239
polarized perception that you impose

6528.76 --> 6534.84
upon yourself in the face of a situation

6531.239 --> 6534.839999999999
like that

6540.52 --> 6546.159000000001
you could just see it as oh people make

6542.76 --> 6550.56
a mistake you see it then you have to

6546.159 --> 6550.5599999999995
correct it or at least attempt to do

6551.76 --> 6557.56
so and it's very annoying when people

6554.32 --> 6557.5599999999995
don't call you the right

6561.76 --> 6564.76
name

6568.32 --> 6574.599
right and hey maybe if you seem a little

6571.679 --> 6576.88
weird and robotic well maybe that is a

6574.599 --> 6576.88
good

6577.36 --> 6585.639
thing like how do you know how do you

6581.679 --> 6587.4800000000005
know that being very human is good or

6585.639 --> 6590.84
being

6587.48 --> 6593.48
robotic is bad how do you know what are

6590.84 --> 6596.159000000001
you using as a measuring stick

6593.48 --> 6598.638999999999
to determine which one is good and which

6596.159 --> 6598.638999999999
one is

6617.8 --> 6624.4400000000005
bad right Rich

6620.8 --> 6625.679
G yeah and it seems like like duper is

6624.44 --> 6628.32
facing the

6625.679 --> 6631.8
same type of

6628.32 --> 6633.679
dilemma and you have to like figure that

6631.8 --> 6637.400000000001
out it's it's a

6633.679 --> 6640.36
typical young adolescent dilemma by the

6637.4 --> 6642.079
way probably a lot of us here went

6640.36 --> 6644.719
through

6642.079 --> 6647.759999999999
that and I'm giving you some pointers I

6644.719 --> 6647.76
really hope you take it to

6647.8 --> 6654.0
heart

6650.32 --> 6657.84
like don't judge yourself

6654.0 --> 6661.44
like badly just perceive yourself

6657.84 --> 6661.4400000000005
perceive what it is and don't

6661.679 --> 6668.1990000000005
judge let the result of the universe be

6665.96 --> 6668.199
the

6671.52 --> 6676.320000000001
judge

6673.36 --> 6679.799999999999
yeah let

6676.32 --> 6679.799999999999
creation show

6679.84 --> 6684.639
you the

6681.639 --> 6684.639
result

6706.96 --> 6713.44
right I hope uh I hope duper is

6710.32 --> 6716.04
listening these are some very important

6713.44 --> 6720.96
things to figure out when you're still

6716.04 --> 6725.719
young and the sooner you're you get over

6720.96 --> 6730.0
it and you become more solid and certain

6725.719 --> 6735.76
about what it is you do and how you do

6730.0 --> 6735.76
it the better for your own strength and

6736.19 --> 6739.339999999999
[Music]

6741.56 --> 6748.320000000001
development right if you feel awkward

6744.36 --> 6750.679
about yourself then realize that it is

6748.32 --> 6750.679
your

6767.639 --> 6773.04
perception and that other people might

6770.119 --> 6775.32
perceive it similarly but how do you

6773.04 --> 6777.4
know they'll respond the same how how do

6775.32 --> 6780.119
you know they'll have the same

6777.4 --> 6782.0
judgment about the perception they have

6780.119 --> 6785.079
of this perceived

6782.0 --> 6788.28
awkwardness right maybe they like it

6785.079 --> 6788.28
maybe they like the

6790.679 --> 6796.719
contrast it's hard to tell because

6793.28 --> 6799.079
you're seeing it from your personal

6796.719 --> 6802.04
vantage point from your social personal

6799.079 --> 6805.159
Vantage Point other people see it from

6802.04 --> 6806.96
their vant vage point and

6805.159 --> 6810.96
so

6806.96 --> 6810.96
don't judge

6811.48 --> 6817.759999999999
things and then like let that judge be

6814.48 --> 6817.759999999999
the ruler of

6831.44 --> 6834.44
it

6838.159 --> 6842.159

so at this point it doesn't matter

6865.719 --> 6870.079

6951.32 --> 6954.32
in

okay I got a

6963.239 --> 6971.36
title for now in between Good Friday and

6966.96 --> 6971.36
Easter and the dilemas of

6980.04 --> 6984.76
self-perception so much chocolate in my

6982.96 --> 6987.44
cboard cuz

6984.76 --> 6990.4400000000005
it's well debatable

6987.44 --> 6993.28
D yeah

6990.44 --> 6995.799999999999
that's don't think uh you could blame

6993.28 --> 6998.599
anybody else for that but you for

6995.8 --> 6998.599
getting all that

7001.76 --> 7009.2390000000005
chocolate I mean the whole chocolate

7004.4 --> 7009.239
thing of Easter really is that's the

7009.88 --> 7015.32
grabler in in the Easter

7012.76 --> 7017.159000000001
tradition the chocolate eggs is the

7015.32 --> 7019.44
gravel it

7017.159 --> 7022.159
is like

7019.44 --> 7024.799999999999
blatantly doesn't mean that you're not

7022.159 --> 7027.0
allowed to no there's no religious

7024.8 --> 7030.400000000001
implication but it is I mean it is like

7027.0 --> 7033.639
blatantly sugar it's mostly

7030.4 --> 7036.159
sugar and

7033.639 --> 7039.32
chocolate make you feel

7036.159 --> 7041.5199999999995
good and it is kind of a gravel because

7039.32 --> 7044.119
in my opinion you should actually around

7041.52 --> 7047.040000000001
this time do a bit of

7044.119 --> 7048.92
fasting and like stay away from sugar as

7047.04 --> 7052.04
much as you can

7048.92 --> 7054.719
because bacterial Bloom they're going to

7052.04 --> 7057.599
feed on it more than

7054.719 --> 7060.719
ever every year it's the beginning of

7057.599 --> 7064.119000000001
Spring so it is like the the chocolate

7060.719 --> 7066.88
Easter eggs really is like a

7064.119 --> 7071.44
gravel of of that

7066.88 --> 7072.84
moment they're like oh chocolate exgs o

7071.44 --> 7075.5199999999995
yes

7072.84 --> 7075.52
money money

7081.92 --> 7086.76
money right and then afterwards the

7084.84 --> 7090.639
dentist go

7086.76 --> 7094.719
oo now we just had Easter lots of kids

7090.639 --> 7097.56
eating a lot of chocolate lots of sugar

7094.719 --> 7097.56
they're going to have some

7101.159 --> 7104.159
customers

7131.119 --> 7134.119
for

7136.48 --> 7140.159
barbecue steak oh

7150.719 --> 7155.0
yummy yeah I'm going to have steak this

7157.48 --> 7162.718999999999
weekend and I got

7160.96 --> 7165.199
like uh

7162.719 --> 7167.36
uh fresh

7165.199 --> 7169.079
parsley so I'm going to have like a

7167.36 --> 7171.28
really nice

7169.079 --> 7174.079
parsley

7171.28 --> 7178.679
based uh garlic sauce and everything

7174.079 --> 7178.679
with that it's going to be very

7179.92 --> 7187.159
yummy I'm really looking forward to

7184.079 --> 7189.719
it I haven't had that in a while but I

7187.159 --> 7194.04
thought like yeah Easter weekend that's

7189.719 --> 7194.04
I'm definitely going to do that

7204.84 --> 7210.88
kilogram Jesus that's a lot of meat de

7208.079 --> 7210.88
bable the

7212.36 --> 7219.28
I that's like Argentinian amounts or

7215.96 --> 7219.28
that's what they used to call

7219.88 --> 7224.04
that I never eat that much meat

7232.719 --> 7238.199
like my system would have trouble

7235.28 --> 7238.199
working through

7241.4 --> 7247.4
that like you're yeah or well you're

7244.44 --> 7249.678999999999
supposed to I do I mean there are some

7247.4 --> 7251.5599999999995
mearian that are just like no it's all

7249.679 --> 7252.719
meat you just got to eat a meat the raar

7251.56 --> 7255.679
the better

7252.719 --> 7258.36
I'm like okay dude in my personal

7255.679 --> 7261.119
experience like you can't just chug keep

7258.36 --> 7263.32
chugging meat without there being

7261.119 --> 7264.839999999999
vegetables in between that and maybe

7263.32 --> 7267.84
some

7264.84 --> 7270.1990000000005
potatoes or like your intestines are

7267.84 --> 7273.159000000001
going to have issues with it or mine at

7270.199 --> 7278.159
least right you might not experience

7273.159 --> 7280.96
that I do like can't just ch down tons

7278.159 --> 7283.96
of meat without anything

7280.96 --> 7283.96
else

7296.119 --> 7299.799999999999
yeah and I'm not going to Chuck down

7297.8 --> 7302.360000000001
gantic amounts of chocolate either

7299.8 --> 7304.360000000001
because that's just I mean that's just

7302.36 --> 7306.88
just because of the sugar alone it's

7304.36 --> 7306.88
just not

7307.44 --> 7314.239
good I mean you could like get like a

7311.159 --> 7317.32
bar of like what is it

7314.239 --> 7320.04
98% pure chocolate or something which

7317.32 --> 7322.079
has relatively very little sugar and

7320.04 --> 7324.32
then you could technically Chu that all

7322.079 --> 7327.159
down slowly I wouldn't

7324.32 --> 7329.679
just take it in a few

7327.159 --> 7331.5599999999995
bites and then you wouldn't really get

7329.679 --> 7335.719
sick of it although you probably get

7331.56 --> 7335.719
some kind of caffeine type Rush from

7336.76 --> 7342.56
it but I mean anything more in the

7339.84 --> 7344.639
direction of regular chocolate you're

7342.56 --> 7347.96
going to be eating a lot of sugar then

7344.639 --> 7351.4800000000005
and that's not recommendable right now

7347.96 --> 7351.4800000000005
it's the sugar that will be the

7354.639 --> 7359.96
problem always keep that in mind yeah

7358.159 --> 7363.44
the chocolatey

7359.96 --> 7366.88
eggs it's the sugar within it that's the

7363.44 --> 7369.44
problem not not the cacao not the

7366.88 --> 7369.4400000000005
chocolate

7370.84 --> 7373.84
itself

7378.679 --> 7381.8
although you shouldn't like eat

7380.119 --> 7383.0
chocolate eggs in the middle of the

7381.8 --> 7384.56
night or anything just like you

7383.0 --> 7385.92
shouldn't drink coffee in the middle of

7384.56 --> 7388.27
the

7385.92 --> 7391.4890000000005
night there's

7388.27 --> 7391.4890000000005
[Music]

7400.84 --> 7403.84
that

7405.599 --> 7411.400000000001
Tom steak

7408.719 --> 7414.639
H okay debatable D well it sounds like

7411.4 --> 7417.44
you then had a couple of Remnant

7414.639 --> 7421.119
hormones that were in the

7417.44 --> 7424.239
Stak so you probably had a bit of I

7421.119 --> 7426.679
don't know what's what is it going to be

7424.239 --> 7430.598999999999
cow

7426.679 --> 7430.599
stair calf

7430.639 --> 7438.32
jumpiness you you got a bit of the

7434.36 --> 7441.159
uh of the yeah inherent nutrients and

7438.32 --> 7445.679
hormones of the the

7441.159 --> 7450.598999999999
creature and that influences you it

7445.679 --> 7453.079
does especially if you eat it relatively

7450.599 --> 7455.88
raw and not super well

7453.079 --> 7458.88
done you're going to get some of

7455.88 --> 7461.92
the the hormonal

7458.88 --> 7464.079
influences and hey those animals have a

7461.92 --> 7464.079
of

7473.88 --> 7479.88
energy or yeah that could also be clutch

7477.04 --> 7484.719
if they did not live well or they had

7479.88 --> 7486.1990000000005
like a a fear panic attack before death

7484.719 --> 7488.159
yeah then it's you're going to have a

7486.199 --> 7490.719
negative influence potentially you might

7488.159 --> 7493.48
get sick of

7490.719 --> 7496.4
it

7493.48 --> 7499.558999999999
but I mean if you were like feeling like

7496.4 --> 7502.558999999999
running a fem race then the animal

fresh fish

7554.559 --> 7560.4800000000005

7572.719 --> 7576.84
amazing I mean amazingly healthy I

7575.239 --> 7578.799999999999

7576.84 --> 7579.96
don't like to eat fish but I I can

7578.8 --> 7583.159000000001
definitely

7579.96 --> 7586.599
imagine that it would be very nourishing

7583.159 --> 7586.598999999999

7589.719 --> 7596.84
that fresh mushrooms that's also nice

nice hope everybody's just enjoying the

Stream

7942.4 --> 7947.36
ah interesting how tribe of shamans say

7945.559 --> 7949.76
their knowledge of the hallucinogenic

7947.36 --> 7953.199
plant comes from the plant

7949.76 --> 7955.360000000001
itself it is that is kind of fascinating

7953.199 --> 7955.36
I

7965.639 --> 7972.8
agree it involves parallel

7969.199 --> 7975.5199999999995
universe what

7972.8 --> 7975.52
did I miss

7994.36 --> 7997.36
something

8000.159 --> 8003.159
huh

8009.28 --> 8014.239
yeah that is

8010.8 --> 8014.2390000000005
weird Richard

G

8053.199 --> 8057.48
yeah I don't I don't get it either what

8055.159 --> 8059.558999999999
debatable is talking about what is he

8057.48 --> 8062.36
referencing

8059.559 --> 8063.84
exactly last thing I notice is they was

8062.36 --> 8066.839999999999
talking

8063.84 --> 8066.84
about

8067.8 --> 8076.04
stakes and that he picked

8071.4 --> 8078.28
a an yeah a wrong mushroom apparently

8076.04 --> 8081.119
that's

8078.28 --> 8083.28
it your comment isn't appearing I guess

8081.119 --> 8083.28
it

8090.04 --> 8093.04
isn't

8102.88 --> 8107.2390000000005
I don't know

8104.159 --> 8109.638999999999
why maybe there's some word that you use

8107.239 --> 8113.638999999999
that were like too

8109.639 --> 8118.559
specific for the algorithm I don't know

8113.639 --> 8121.599
but maybe you want to resay it and

8118.559 --> 8125.400000000001
then use different types of

8121.599 --> 8126.559
words that you think might be a risk

8125.4 --> 8130.079
factor or

8126.559 --> 8133.320000000001
something TV show called constellation

8130.079 --> 8133.32
oh never heard of

8139.159 --> 8146.32
it competitor of Google's platform what

8143.599 --> 8146.32
what does that even

8150.04 --> 8153.04
mean

8153.119 --> 8160.558999999999
writing their fruit

8155.48 --> 8160.558999999999
name blocked your message wow

8161.079 --> 8164.599
really must be

8178.119 --> 8182.96
serious

8179.96 --> 8182.96
huh

8187.599 --> 8191.479
well debatably never mind

8189.84 --> 8195.519
that

8191.479 --> 8195.519
Apple oh

8201.16 --> 8208.319
okay are they really competitors though

8205.639 --> 8210.438999999998
now it works yeah but because you're

8208.319 --> 8213.24
just saying the word Apple it's if

8210.439 --> 8216.439
you're going to say the world Apple in

8213.24 --> 8218.359
in relation to that other thing then the

8216.439 --> 8219.519
algorithm's probably going to figure out

8218.359 --> 8220.960000000001
that you're talking about the

8219.519 --> 8224.08
competitive

8220.96 --> 8227.438999999998
product if you just say apple yeah

8224.08 --> 8227.439
that's just an

8232.84 --> 8235.84
apple

8236.519 --> 8242.92
constellation okay I take it that's not

8239.319 --> 8242.92
on Netflix

8254.28 --> 8258.16
maybe it is let me

8266.479 --> 8269.479

8389.72 --> 8392.72
ISS

8392.88 --> 8398.199999999999
recently

8395.16 --> 8401.28
added yeah okay I guess I'll I'm going

8398.2 --> 8404.640000000001
to be checking that

8401.28 --> 8409.52
out thank you for the

8404.64 --> 8409.519999999999
tip I the Netflix series

8411.399 --> 8417.68
what it's

8413.96 --> 8421.16
German all righty then so it is an

8417.68 --> 8423.68
original German series I guess the

8421.16 --> 8426.88
signal okay

8423.68 --> 8426.880000000001
interesting I

8427.16 --> 8432.24
think I'll check that out thank you for

8430.04 --> 8432.240000000002
the

8433.359 --> 8438.6
tip although it's kind of like already

8436.84 --> 8443.12
like oh you're going to start out with

8438.6 --> 8447.68
the ISS going around the globe

8443.12 --> 8447.68
okay now what that direction is going to

8449.64 --> 8452.64
be

8453.88 --> 8458.199999999999
they compare it to the show

8456.16 --> 8461.2
dark

8458.2 --> 8463.0
okay well dark

8461.2 --> 8465.439
was

8463.0 --> 8468.07
fascinating but

8465.439 --> 8470.720000000001
also kind of

8468.07 --> 8476.88
[Music]

8470.72 --> 8476.88
depressing 1899 got cancelled

8479.64 --> 8483.96
what

8481.56 --> 8483.96
what is

8490.88 --> 8496.679999999998
that another show is that like a prequel

8494.64 --> 8500.599999999999
to what is it

8496.68 --> 8500.6
1905 or something what was

8500.84 --> 8505.439
it about the weird boat

8507.2 --> 8512.08
thing the word that's what it started

8509.479 --> 8515.84
out with and then everything gets super

8512.08 --> 8515.84
surreal I remember that

8516.12 --> 8521.28
one that is

8519.439 --> 8523.880000000001
1899

8521.28 --> 8526.2
Oh Oh you mean it got

8523.88 --> 8530.599999999999
discontinued I mean it can't get

8526.2 --> 8530.6
cancelled since the series already

8531.0 --> 8537.52
there so it got discontinued you say

8534.88 --> 8539.319
that's not surprising though I think

8537.52 --> 8542.04
that this is a new trend there's a lot

8539.319 --> 8545.16
of like starting new things and then

8542.04 --> 8546.76
just continuing it why because starting

8545.16 --> 8550.08
something new and

8546.76 --> 8552.92
revolutionary is like 10 times easier

8550.08 --> 8556.28
than trying to continue it on the same

8552.92 --> 8559.479
level once it gets

8556.28 --> 8561.6
going it's like a universal problem

8559.479 --> 8563.679999999998
that's why there's a lot of good series

8561.6 --> 8565.56
that they like start out like wow this

8563.68 --> 8569.64
is really

8565.56 --> 8573.199999999999
awesome and then they're like okay end

8569.64 --> 8577.599999999999
of the season end of this chapter and

8573.2 --> 8582.560000000001
then it just stops why because how like

8577.6 --> 8585.960000000001
it's 10 to 100 times more effort to try

8582.56 --> 8586.8
to actually continue the story on its

8585.96 --> 8591.039999999999
own

8586.8 --> 8593.279999999999
level without basically crashing it

8591.04 --> 8596.0
crashing the energy of it that was built

8593.28 --> 8596.0
up in the first

8597.319 --> 8602.16
season so this is a typical thing that

8600.279 --> 8605.08
keep keeps happening with

8602.16 --> 8608.96
Netflix like oh a new Ser oh wow that's

8605.08 --> 8611.76
really awesome and then yeah it's oh

8608.96 --> 8614.8
this a big story it's huge and you only

8611.76 --> 8616.92
get to see the first chapter because

8614.8 --> 8619.56
after that first chapter rounds out like

8616.92 --> 8622.960000000001
they just don't know how to freaking top

8619.56 --> 8625.8
that so just give it up like oh let's

8622.96 --> 8628.16
try something new then do it again with

8625.8 --> 8628.16
another

8629.439 --> 8634.439
story

8631.24 --> 8635.64
right I mean you'd have to be a straight

8634.439 --> 8639.92
out

8635.64 --> 8645.16
Visionary to really finish a bigger

8639.92 --> 8648.24
story arc like it would have to be the

8645.16 --> 8650.96
writers the writer the original writer

8648.24 --> 8653.92
of the story would have to like complete

8650.96 --> 8657.0
it and sometimes writers spent their

8653.92 --> 8659.52
entire life trying to do that trying to

8657.0 --> 8661.04
complete a story because it's that

8659.52 --> 8666.12
difficult to actually

8661.04 --> 8669.640000000001
finish the story compared to starting

8666.12 --> 8670.880000000001
it right and especially if you're like

8669.64 --> 8674.16
Mass

8670.88 --> 8677.64
producing series and

8674.16 --> 8679.2
whatever for organizations like Netflix

8677.64 --> 8682.599999999999
like you're just going to like try to

8679.2 --> 8685.359
rush out as much interesting hyped new

8682.6 --> 8689.0
stuff as you can but like you can't be

8685.359 --> 8692.08
expected to actually complete the

8689.0 --> 8695.439
story as way too much effort you don't

8692.08 --> 8698.0
have time for that

8695.439 --> 8700.880000000001
like those people that make these shows

8698.0 --> 8703.359
they're not like science fiction writers

8700.88 --> 8705.56
like for example Frank herberts who just

8703.359 --> 8709.479000000001
spent his entire

8705.56 --> 8712.479
life completing the entire dun Saga

8709.479 --> 8715.358999999999
letting it all make sense like he spent

8712.479 --> 8720.399
his entire life trying to finish that

8715.359 --> 8723.800000000001
story yeah some underrun Netflix writers

8720.399 --> 8723.8
they don't have time for that

8724.6 --> 8731.399000000001
[ __ ] so you got to realize that a lot of

8728.399 --> 8733.199999999999
things on Netflix will get cancelled

8731.399 --> 8735.76
because they just don't know how to

8733.2 --> 8735.76
continue

8739.56 --> 8743.96
it they don't apply to

8744.319 --> 8749.319
8099 planned on two or three seasons and

8747.52 --> 8752.800000000001
wrap it

8749.319 --> 8755.56
up you to cost versus

8752.8 --> 8758.56
viewership

8755.56 --> 8758.56
what

8758.92 --> 8762.399
okay that is a

8768.96 --> 8775.119999999999
shame

8771.08 --> 8775.12
really I thought it was really

8779.319 --> 8782.319
successful

8784.319 --> 8787.56
huh oh

8788.6 --> 8793.68
well look at some point maybe they'll

8791.439 --> 8796.319
continue it

8793.68 --> 8799.16
anyway right I mean you got to realize

8796.319 --> 8803.119999999999
also that the series is not based off

8799.16 --> 8806.16
child actors so there's really not that

8803.12 --> 8809.08
much of a reason not to like just keep

8806.16 --> 8813.24
hold it off and then continue another

8809.08 --> 8817.279
time if if a if a Series has child

8813.24 --> 8821.84
actors in it then you have to you have

8817.279 --> 8824.0
to in one go do it all otherwise the

8821.84 --> 8826.880000000001
child actors will literally grow up and

8824.0 --> 8829.88
then you're completely

8826.88 --> 8833.358999999999
incapable of continuing the story

8829.88 --> 8836.278999999999
line so if any series like doesn't have

8833.359 --> 8837.800000000001
child actors in it then it's not that

8836.279 --> 8840.880000000001
much of

8837.8 --> 8842.92
a of a hassle if you just

8840.88 --> 8845.96
discontinue it for a while and then

8842.92 --> 8845.960000000001
maybe later pick it

8849.24 --> 8853.76
up so who knows where that

8862.68 --> 8869.439
goes what

8866.08 --> 8871.0
ipv 10 bucks a year oh that is really

8869.439 --> 8873.399
cheap

8871.0 --> 8876.72
but is that legal though is

8873.399 --> 8876.72
that I don't

8877.2 --> 8883.880000000001
know I've never heard of IP TV

8881.2 --> 8887.76
before but uh yeah I mean all those

8883.88 --> 8890.96
other things Prime Disney Sky I don't

8887.76 --> 8890.960000000001
even know what sky

8895.439 --> 8903.0
is I'm just I just got Netflix through

8899.6 --> 8905.359
somebody El and it is legal

8903.0 --> 8909.16
yeah and that's good enough and if

8905.359 --> 8912.399000000001
something is like really worthwhile I'll

8909.16 --> 8915.08
just freaking download

8912.399 --> 8917.76
it like if something is really good I

8915.08 --> 8920.68
like to have it on my

8917.76 --> 8924.399
computer so that if it like gets

8920.68 --> 8928.84
discontinued for whatever damn reason

8924.399 --> 8931.84
these big media companies see see fit

8928.84 --> 8934.359
then I just have it I just have it and

8931.84 --> 8934.359
can watch

8951.0 --> 8956.2
it please go about hiring Riders to

8954.24 --> 8959.119999999999
screw them out of

8956.2 --> 8962.12
Ro

8959.12 --> 8962.12
what

8965.72 --> 8971.119999999999
yeah yeah yeah I mean

8968.64 --> 8974.16
corporations these Mega corporations how

8971.12 --> 8977.04
they go about it's all like they get so

8974.16 --> 8980.84
obsessed with money and they're so

8977.04 --> 8983.52
leaning on the availability of

8980.84 --> 8986.0
Market that they're just trying to

8983.52 --> 8989.04
grabble everything out of it they're

8986.0 --> 8990.56
they're basically testing like can we

8989.04 --> 8993.279
literally Rob

8990.56 --> 8997.56
every piece of quality from this product

8993.279 --> 9000.640000000001
we can and still get away with it yeah

8997.56 --> 9004.479
it's it's like a grabler [ __ ] test they

9000.64 --> 9007.96
have to do it the formula is so

9004.479 --> 9010.199999999999
successful they have to see if they can

9007.96 --> 9011.88
literally Hollow it out and still get

9010.2 --> 9014.52
away with it they just have to they

9011.88 --> 9014.519999999999
don't have a

9014.56 --> 9021.68
choice the grabler compels

9019.04 --> 9025.560000000001
them

9021.68 --> 9028.960000000001
right but I mean the more they do it the

9025.56 --> 9032.68
more actual writers people that create

9028.96 --> 9036.64
quality in such products will start to

9032.68 --> 9038.84
defend themselves against that and

9036.64 --> 9041.439
basically start to do their own thing at

9038.84 --> 9041.439
their own

9041.8 --> 9047.599999999999
pace with their own

9045.04 --> 9048.640000000001
directives and that's how you get series

9047.6 --> 9051.399000000001
like

9048.64 --> 9053.56
Firefly which ironically and

9051.399 --> 9057.399
unfortunately was also discontinued at

9053.56 --> 9060.119999999999
the time because of top down decisions

9057.399 --> 9063.8
that everybody freaking was pissed off

9060.12 --> 9066.160000000002
over to no end right but it is how that

9063.8 --> 9069.278999999999
happens people like

9066.16 --> 9071.399
resist the corporate grabler spirit in

9069.279 --> 9074.84
Hollywood and then just like they find

9071.399 --> 9077.479
their own and they get this group

9074.84 --> 9079.6
chemistry and then they make something

9077.479 --> 9081.96
that just blows everything else out of

9079.6 --> 9081.960000000001
the water

9082.279 --> 9087.560000000001
that's how the real magic happens the

9083.92 --> 9091.56
real movie Magic is when the grabl are

9087.56 --> 9091.56
resisted that's when it really

9093.08 --> 9098.96
happens seems like moneya laundering

9095.24 --> 9102.52
system of course of course potentially

9098.96 --> 9104.96
the grabler yeah if they can they'll

9102.52 --> 9108.399000000001
certainly try you know they'll be

9104.96 --> 9111.919999999998
trying they just trying you can't help

9108.399 --> 9111.92
it they have to do it

9135.76 --> 9138.52
the system is

9138.92 --> 9141.92
rigged

9147.96 --> 9153.56
maybe rigging is the system ever

9151.0 --> 9153.56
considered

9155.439 --> 9161.359
that maybe the rigging is what the

9158.439 --> 9161.359
system really

9168.84 --> 9171.84
is

9174.72 --> 9178.84
hey borders boy what do I get to see

9185.0 --> 9190.08
you pting for

9188.2 --> 9195.640000000001
ipv

9190.08 --> 9195.64
paying okay B why but I mean is it legal

9198.84 --> 9201.84
though

9205.279 --> 9210.2
I've never heard of that before maybe

9207.24 --> 9210.199999999999
it's a really good

9210.37 --> 9215.0
[Music]

9212.0 --> 9215.0
service

9217.24 --> 9220.24
ipv

9228.84 --> 9231.84

9297.68 --> 9302.68
some point thanks for the

9300.04 --> 9305.160000000002
tip interesting to see that that's there

9302.68 --> 9307.52
although to say oh I'm going to do this

9305.16 --> 9309.64
to avoid the grabler uh how do you know

9307.52 --> 9314.08
this is not just another grabler just

9309.64 --> 9316.92
out grabbling the other Grapplers

9314.08 --> 9321.52
really you don't have to email me it's

9316.92 --> 9324.24
just that they have a website

9321.52 --> 9326.479000000001
that's exactly what you say 10 10 bucks

9324.24 --> 9326.479
a

9331.56 --> 9336.88
year but just realize that

9334.96 --> 9339.679999999998
oh

9336.88 --> 9343.08
I'm resisting the corporate grabler

9339.68 --> 9345.880000000001
Spirit by doing this yeah what if that

9343.08 --> 9348.96
thing is just another grabler out

9345.88 --> 9352.278999999999
grabbling the other Grabbers I mean

9348.96 --> 9352.278999999999
isn't that what they always

9352.359 --> 9355.6
do just

9356.04 --> 9360.92
saying it doesn't mean that it's not a

9358.12 --> 9360.92
good service

9362.6 --> 9369.08
though is a closed group it's invite

9367.479 --> 9373.399

9378.72 --> 9381.72
into

9392.16 --> 9396.68

9394.439 --> 9398.359
but I mean I'm not really interested

9396.68 --> 9401.56
