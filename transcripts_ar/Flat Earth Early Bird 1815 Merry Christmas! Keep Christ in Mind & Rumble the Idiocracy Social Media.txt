38.04 --> 42.879
cool morning welcome to Flat Earth early

41.399 --> 46.120000000000005
bird number

42.879 --> 48.28
1815 I'm your host Arwin and before

46.12 --> 50.64
start the show please don't please don't

48.28 --> 53.44
forget to share it on any platform you

50.64 --> 55.399
deem fit and if you haven't already

53.44 --> 57.64
subscribe to my channel and hit the Bell

55.399 --> 60.32
notification so you know when I'm going

57.64 --> 62.199
live which is normally 1: p.m. Amer time

60.32 --> 64.559
in the weekdays and 2: p.m. Amsterdam

62.199 --> 66.6
time in the weekend and please also do

64.559 --> 68.56
support me through the PayPal and the

66.6 --> 71.39999999999999
patreon that'll be much appreciate it

68.56 --> 74.72
and you can always use the

71.4 --> 77.2
support right so yeah Christmas Day

74.72 --> 79.79899999999999
first Christmas Day might be one of the

77.2 --> 82.92
only shows on the entire internet that's

79.799 --> 84.36000000000001
actually doing it live probably not the

82.92 --> 87.36
only

84.36 --> 91.52
one but I'm

87.36 --> 95.03999999999999
here weather today is a lot better

91.52 --> 100.84
actually might be some sun out here and

95.04 --> 100.84
there it's less clouded a lot less

103.6 --> 108.91999999999999
windy there's actually a lot of from

106.719 --> 109.91999999999999
what I can hear a lot of like work

108.92 --> 113.64
happening

109.92 --> 116.88
on people like working on their houses

113.64 --> 118.43900000000001
and all that so seems like today it's

116.88 --> 120.88
being used by a lot of people to

118.439 --> 123.88
actually do construction work work

120.88 --> 125.22999999999999
renovation and all

123.88 --> 128.299
that at

125.23 --> 128.299
[Music]

129.52 --> 132.52
home

132.72 --> 137.4
right yeah quite an improvement on over

138.319 --> 144.07999999999998
yesterday hello Richard G first in chat

141.04 --> 146.319
Merry Christmas Happy Christmas yeah

144.08 --> 148.76000000000002
Merry

146.319 --> 151.76
Christmas good to see

148.76 --> 151.76
you

154.48 --> 159.82999999999998
of course

155.68 --> 161.92000000000002
it's Monday the 25th of December

159.83 --> 165.48000000000002
[Music]

161.92 --> 165.48
2023 Christmas

170.319 --> 173.319
day

174.12 --> 180.31900000000002
yeah uh I have no idea if Nathan's going

176.8 --> 184.15900000000002
to do a live show I'm guessing not

180.319 --> 186.159
but he might we'll see but I'm guessing

184.159 --> 188.56
not he's very likely just with the

186.159 --> 188.56
family

188.64 --> 192.48
today right so I'm starting a little

190.72 --> 195.12
late and I'll probably then be

192.48 --> 195.11999999999998
continuing

196.08 --> 199.76000000000002
further we'll see what

201.87 --> 205.03900000000002
[Music]

206.239 --> 211.4
happens right so yeah yesterday show uh

209.4 --> 215.08
the Co that hadn't actually paid

211.4 --> 218.48000000000002
attention I was quite

215.08 --> 219.76000000000002
Moody the weather kind of sucked and I

218.48 --> 222.64
was really

219.76 --> 227.07999999999998
restless

222.64 --> 227.07999999999998
and kind of felt stuck with

232.159 --> 238.04
it right so yeah in that sense like the

235.879 --> 240.319
last half hour was kind of a shame I

238.04 --> 242.48
wish I that just didn't had have

240.319 --> 244.51899999999998
happened at

242.48 --> 247.64
all

244.519 --> 249.519
but I mean you might have noticed I

247.64 --> 252.67999999999998
literally tried to round out the show

249.519 --> 252.68
and then just couldn't do

255.759 --> 263.4
it all right I got a white cat's

260.4 --> 263.4
Christmas

268.6 --> 273.779
right

270.61 --> 273.779
[Music]

275.36 --> 282.52000000000004
hey Hello

277.759 --> 282.52000000000004
Kitty so that's nice kitty coming for a

294.919 --> 300.88
visit yeah and kitty also likes the the

297.88 --> 303.32
heater right here likes to stand in

300.88 --> 303.32
front of

306.88 --> 314.32
that right but anyway today I kind of

310.36 --> 314.32
like promised myself I would be less

322.72 --> 328.47900000000004
cranky like so

325.6 --> 331.47900000000004
today it's going to be different

328.479 --> 331.479
hopefully

348.96 --> 354.919
so what kept me up late

351.6 --> 354.91900000000004
yesterday let

358.479 --> 361.479
see

373.36 --> 376.599
what have you been doing Richie

376.72 --> 387.069
[Music]

388.4 --> 391.4
G

398.16 --> 405.66
just go see in the history of my browser

403.36 --> 408.829
what I was doing

405.66 --> 408.829
[Music]

416.879 --> 421.759
then oh yeah now I remember what watch

419.599 --> 425.4
it like an older

421.759 --> 429.039
movie was it again like another older

425.4 --> 429.039
war movie that I hadn't seen

430.16 --> 436.68
before

433.16 --> 436.68
uh remember

448.319 --> 451.319
that

453.56 --> 455.84
all

459.4 --> 464.28
right yeah but I mean yesterday what

462.44 --> 467.96
really kind of triggered something with

464.28 --> 470.44
me was like the whole pearling noise

467.96 --> 472.4
steamy said like I had have I not heard

470.44 --> 474.319
of it I definitely heard of it but I

472.4 --> 477.31899999999996
always keep getting it wrong every time

474.319 --> 482.03900000000004
I hear of it cuz I just assume it's a

477.319 --> 482.03900000000004
noise when it isn't a noise it's a noise

484.199 --> 489.44
pattern which is not

486.68 --> 495.0
sound and every time I hear of it I

489.44 --> 495.0
always get it wrong first it's weird and

495.84 --> 502.0
annoying but yeah of course I've heard

498.12 --> 503.12
of it before like because that's a part

502.0 --> 506.12
of

503.12 --> 507.36
it every time you Wiki search it you

506.12 --> 510.08
always get

507.36 --> 514.519
that so

510.08 --> 514.519
uh ter 306 good to see

514.76 --> 521.959
you studying on Flat Earth arguments

519.479 --> 525.2
okay what are you

521.959 --> 525.1999999999999
studying what

530.34 --> 533.58
[Music]

538.2 --> 543.75
arguments

540.17 --> 543.75
[Music]

548.6 --> 554.72
right by way I got Illuminati C

550.92 --> 554.7199999999999
downstairs I'm going to get it right

568.12 --> 571.12
now

595.5 --> 598.649
[Music]

609.079 --> 615.8389999999999
Ling ah the gas and weight thing

613.04 --> 618.959
okay right

615.839 --> 621.519
well I'm I'll gladly assist you with

618.959 --> 624.5999999999999
that understanding Richard

621.519 --> 627.839
G so the whole point is is

624.6 --> 629.9200000000001
like if you have a trouble understanding

627.839 --> 632.9200000000001
gas and weight

629.92 --> 637.519
then focus on weight what is

632.92 --> 637.519
it what do you think weight really

637.68 --> 642.399
is what is it in your mind when it you

640.72 --> 646.0400000000001
can't put it

642.399 --> 651.2
together right because the real problem

646.04 --> 651.1999999999999
is what is weight what is it

652.279 --> 656.76
actually that's the

654.519 --> 659.519
problem right

656.76 --> 661.04
everybody knows how people are argue

659.519 --> 664.32
about

661.04 --> 668.279
gravity but do any of the people that

664.32 --> 671.0790000000001
argue gravity actually know what it

668.279 --> 674.68
is that's the

671.079 --> 674.68
problem problem is they

676.56 --> 684.0
don't gas has weight when it is

678.92 --> 684.0
contained no no it it doesn't have

685.36 --> 690.9590000000001
weight it's not the same

687.959 --> 690.959
thing

697.68 --> 705.519
right there's some relative density dise

701.959 --> 706.6389999999999
equilibrium of a gas tank the medium it

705.519 --> 709.519
is sitting

706.639 --> 711.16
in when you fill it up with gas

709.519 --> 715.839
pressurized

711.16 --> 720.88
gas but that scale readout is not

715.839 --> 724.0400000000001
proportional to any convention

720.88 --> 727.48
weight it's like separate it's a

724.04 --> 731.68
separate thing because the convention of

727.48 --> 731.6800000000001
weight doesn't apply to

734.16 --> 743.399
gases right now of course for industrial

739.8 --> 746.12
use that's they're still going to like

743.399 --> 747.88
designate kilograms or whatever to the

746.12 --> 749.72
content of a gas

747.88 --> 752.04
tank

749.72 --> 754.44
but it's another thing it's it's not the

752.04 --> 754.4399999999999
same

755.36 --> 762.12
thing right it's just like yeah scale

758.36 --> 765.24
reads weight but it isn't actually

762.12 --> 765.24
weight it's something

768.16 --> 774.6
else that you weight when you know the

771.6 --> 778.519
weight of something you can figure out

774.6 --> 780.76
like most things about material but it

778.519 --> 785.24
doesn't work like that when you have

780.76 --> 785.24
that supposed weight information about

788.6 --> 796.24
gas you can't tell what kind of gas

792.399 --> 799.76
something is by how much of it in

796.24 --> 799.76
kilograms is sitting in a

802.0 --> 805.839
tank unless you already know exactly

804.92 --> 810.76
what it

805.839 --> 810.7600000000001
is that's in there

816.8 --> 821.16
right so for example kind of silly

819.079 --> 823.279
example like you can take a gas tank

821.16 --> 827.399
that's designated for

823.279 --> 830.72
helium and then fill it up to the exact

827.399 --> 833.0
amount that if you put it on the scale

830.72 --> 835.36
you literally won't be able to tell

833.0 --> 837.759
whether there is helium in there or

835.36 --> 840.759
whether the tank is completely

837.759 --> 840.759
empty

843.04 --> 847.92
because you could just have just that

845.24 --> 848.9590000000001
amount of helium in there that it gains

847.92 --> 851.8389999999999
more

848.959 --> 853.2399999999999
density versus the air outside in the

851.839 --> 856.5600000000001
air that is

853.24 --> 860.16
expanded and you can just balance it out

856.56 --> 864.16
that the amount of helium in the tank is

860.16 --> 867.68
exactly the same density on average as

864.16 --> 870.04
if the tank would have been open to the

867.68 --> 871.56
air

870.04 --> 874.24
and then how would you know there's

871.56 --> 876.959
anything in there you

874.24 --> 878.92
wouldn't because it registers zero

876.959 --> 883.7589999999999
weight even though there's

878.92 --> 883.759
clearly gas compressed in

892.29 --> 895.51
[Music]

897.199 --> 901.4799999999999
there not a physical weight directly

899.8 --> 904.399
able to be measured

901.48 --> 909.12
yes gas by itself cannot really be

904.399 --> 912.279
measured in weight you can only

909.12 --> 917.48
measure an apparent extra

912.279 --> 917.48
weight as a as a part of an

918.48 --> 925.5600000000001
object it's basically you

921.92 --> 930.5999999999999
can add on or they even decrease the

925.56 --> 930.5999999999999
weight of an object with gas Conta

931.68 --> 936.68
but it is only like like what you

934.0 --> 940.6
register on the scale the

936.68 --> 942.7589999999999
the prance of the disequilibrium of the

940.6 --> 945.9590000000001
object with the

942.759 --> 945.9590000000001
medium the

947.04 --> 953.36
total right if you then

950.04 --> 955.8389999999999
dissect all the material of the

953.36 --> 958.36
object and you put it

955.839 --> 960.6
together you don't you shouldn't have

958.36 --> 960.6
that

965.319 --> 971.079
weight right because you're just having

968.12 --> 973.399
some weight colloquial weight right some

971.079 --> 977.519
weight anything can have some

973.399 --> 980.36
weight if it is more dense than the air

977.519 --> 982.639
medium it is in it will start to exert

980.36 --> 982.639
some

985.639 --> 989.9590000000001
pressure but that pressure reading

988.24 --> 994.0790000000001
you're you're not going to be able to

989.959 --> 996.4399999999999
like feed that back into other systems

994.079 --> 999.8
like of the convention and everything

996.44 --> 1002.6800000000001
and then determine perfectly what it is

999.8 --> 1006.5999999999999
based on that weight

1002.68 --> 1008.959
registry because it's just some weight

1006.6 --> 1011.36
colloquial not

1008.959 --> 1015.92
conventional because conventional weight

1011.36 --> 1015.92
only really works with solids and

1017.48 --> 1020.48
liquids

1024.839 --> 1031.3999999999999
right so and that's that's a confusing

1027.919 --> 1035.6000000000001
thing it's like yeah you go to

1031.4 --> 1037.88
some gas tank company

1035.6 --> 1040.12
whatever and they'll give you like oh

1037.88 --> 1042.1200000000001
this tank is full yeah this is like 20

1040.12 --> 1045.4799999999998
kilg of

1042.12 --> 1047.4389999999999
gas but I mean it's technically not

1045.48 --> 1049.96
though it's just that's what they call

1047.439 --> 1052.88
that

1049.96 --> 1052.88
it's like

1052.919 --> 1059.44
another separate

1056.52 --> 1061.679
convention like it's a non-weight based

1059.44 --> 1063.52
convention that kind of like just they

1061.679 --> 1064.919
just call it weight it's like they use

1063.52 --> 1067.96
the same

1064.919 --> 1071.0
scale and so they just call it weight

1067.96 --> 1071.0
but it isn't the

1072.44 --> 1080.4
same it's not the like the the

1076.6 --> 1080.3999999999999
official weight

1083.08 --> 1087.32
hey mystical rock hound and fossils good

1085.0 --> 1087.32
to see

1095.13 --> 1100.4
[Music]

1097.0 --> 1105.44
you pour gas from a cup on the

1100.4 --> 1105.44
scale yeah well you want read anything

1106.52 --> 1112.72
then like if you l pour gas on a scale

1110.76 --> 1116.679
if the gas is more dense in its

1112.72 --> 1120.48
concentrated form like the amount

1116.679 --> 1125.039
of registry of that would be so

1120.48 --> 1125.039
microscopic it it's like a a slight

1127.2 --> 1132.559
Tremor so yeah there will be colloquial

1130.12 --> 1134.6399999999999
maybe some if you have a super super

1132.559 --> 1137.12
sensitive skill it might like register

1134.64 --> 1140.919
like a slight Tremor

1137.12 --> 1143.7199999999998
like but I mean that's not stable

1140.919 --> 1145.3600000000001
weight and it's not going to last that

1143.72 --> 1148.559
registry is not going to be a stable

1145.36 --> 1148.559
reading that's going to

1156.039 --> 1164.52
stay so

1158.159 --> 1167.0390000000002
yeah gas may have some collo weight

1164.52 --> 1170.48
registered but it's not proportional you

1167.039 --> 1173.44
can't use it with the with the rest of

1170.48 --> 1173.44
the weight

1190.32 --> 1195.52
convention reading of

1192.52 --> 1195.52
pressure

1196.88 --> 1202.2800000000002
well argu

1198.799 --> 1204.8799999999999
yes Richard G like I think that's what

1202.28 --> 1208.96
Adam me

1204.88 --> 1211.0
says and I mean if when I if you say

1208.96 --> 1212.88
that it sort of feels like it's an

1211.0 --> 1215.6
excuse but I mean technically yeah there

1212.88 --> 1220.0
is pressure happening but that

1215.6 --> 1220.0
pressure would be in all

1221.28 --> 1229.44
directions it's the only way to explain

1224.679 --> 1231.3600000000001
why it then proceeds to like amount to

1229.44 --> 1235.0
apparent

1231.36 --> 1237.6789999999999
weight would be explained through the

1235.0 --> 1242.24
relative density system like that's the

1237.679 --> 1245.76
only go-to like the reason like

1242.24 --> 1248.559
why is because in its concentrated form

1245.76 --> 1251.52
its pressurized state it is more dense

1248.559 --> 1255.1589999999999
than the air and so it will want to go

1251.52 --> 1260.12
down with lack of the of ability to move

1255.159 --> 1260.1200000000001
in any direction as it would normally do

1261.2 --> 1267.72
so relative density dis equilibrium is

1263.96 --> 1267.72
really the only thing to point

1268.679 --> 1277.0
at why compressed gas that's not

1272.72 --> 1281.72
necessarily liquid or something why it

1277.0 --> 1281.72
would register weight on a

1283.679 --> 1290.88
scale right so this whole process is

1287.64 --> 1292.72
blade ly just very headache inducing

1290.88 --> 1293.8400000000001
just to be able to get it right and put

1292.72 --> 1297.799
it down

1293.84 --> 1300.3999999999999
properly while for Outsiders it's so

1297.799 --> 1301.52
easy to just say no I don't know what

1300.4 --> 1303.52
the hell you're talking about you're

1301.52 --> 1305.9189999999999
just wrong it just has weight you put it

1303.52 --> 1308.36
on a scale it registers weight it's

1305.919 --> 1311.1200000000001
weight gas has weight you put it on a

1308.36 --> 1313.7199999999998
scale it has weight and that's just what

1311.12 --> 1316.6399999999999
you're going to be then just looping in

1313.72 --> 1320.0
your head all the time saying that it's

1316.64 --> 1322.7990000000002
happening to some people out there

1320.0 --> 1325.039
there and they can't address anything

1322.799 --> 1326.8799999999999
that I talked about anything that I try

1325.039 --> 1329.36
to explain they never address it they

1326.88 --> 1331.88
just Resort back to the little Loop in

1329.36 --> 1334.039
their mind that's what they reference

1331.88 --> 1337.6000000000001
they don't reference anything I

1334.039 --> 1337.6
said that keeps

1339.48 --> 1345.24
happening the whole thing gets really

1341.72 --> 1345.24
people stuck in a loop in her

1345.36 --> 1351.799
head Hell seeking star water

1348.6 --> 1351.799
yeah Merry Christmas to you

1352.08 --> 1355.559

interesting cany handle the Winter

1803.919 --> 1809.24
though all right

1806.799 --> 1813.519
anyway I think I'm going to turn on my

1809.24 --> 1818.1200000000001
coffee and start eating this Illuminati

1813.519 --> 1818.1200000000001

for

1888.2 --> 1894.1200000000001
oh Mexico no indoors in Winter

1897.6 --> 1902.1589999999999
right hey Tommy Merry

1908.82 --> 1913.32
[Music]

1911.0 --> 1916.08
Christmas today's going to be C

1913.32 --> 1919.1589999999999
yesterday was a disaster technically I'm

1916.08 --> 1919.1589999999999
just GNA say it

1921.0 --> 1926.919
I wanted to actually like really get

1922.679 --> 1926.919
into it psychologically like how that

1928.36 --> 1931.36
was

1933.679 --> 1940.679
cuz it well yeah it's just really weird

1937.919 --> 1943.3990000000001
when I'm in a state of mind like that

1940.679 --> 1946.0800000000002
like everything works differently on the

1943.399 --> 1949.08
inside and it's

1946.08 --> 1949.08
like

1949.2 --> 1952.44
things look

1955.48 --> 1962.3990000000001
differently and like it changes my

1958.44 --> 1962.3990000000001
personality in a way it's very

1967.84 --> 1974.279
weird about disas Mr Rumble said that

1971.279 --> 1976.039
once ban me B yeah but Mr wo's kind of

1974.279 --> 1978.159
an

1976.039 --> 1981.919
ass

1978.159 --> 1981.919
so I expect him to do

1982.639 --> 1987.12
that n he's not always in that but he

1985.039 --> 1990.24
can be he's like he's a

1987.12 --> 1993.639
Ballard so I expect that like most

1990.24 --> 1995.799
ballards do that like B me B me when

1993.639 --> 1997.8799999999999
when that happens and it's like yeah

1995.799 --> 1999.44
like I expect that because like yeah

1997.88 --> 2002.3990000000001
you're a baller what else are you going

1999.44 --> 2002.3990000000001
to do you

2002.519 --> 2008.639
know but not with stey traveler

2005.76 --> 2010.12
absolutely not and Ides like we've had

2008.639 --> 2013.36
like sort of a

2010.12 --> 2016.399
friendship for quite a while talking

2013.36 --> 2018.8799999999999
like daily over

2016.399 --> 2021.84
Skype but I I was just starting to

2018.88 --> 2024.7990000000002
notice a pattern for a while a pattern

2021.84 --> 2024.799
that I found quite

2025.48 --> 2032.039
agitating cheeky old fell yeah well

2029.919 --> 2034.72
sometimes he just acts like he's my wife

2032.039 --> 2038.96
or something and that kind of pisses me

2034.72 --> 2038.96
off it's like

2042.519 --> 2046.0
no just

2046.72 --> 2054.32
no like if I wanted that kind of a thing

2049.96 --> 2057.2400000000002
i' like f vehemently watched every QE

2054.32 --> 2059.079
live from beginning to end because

2057.24 --> 2061.7999999999997
there's a character there that does

2059.079 --> 2061.8
exactly

2063.56 --> 2072.2
that it's called Betty yeah I don't like

2069.0 --> 2074.44
that I don't even think it's funny I

2072.2 --> 2076.879
just find it very

2074.44 --> 2080.44
annoying and when somebody acts like

2076.879 --> 2081.5989999999997
that or when they just start like doing

2080.44 --> 2086.28
that and

2081.599 --> 2089.32
expecting things right with it

2086.28 --> 2091.119
like that's like trying to take over the

2089.32 --> 2094.9190000000003
show effect it's like trying to take

2091.119 --> 2098.1600000000003
over me and how I behave and I am highly

2094.919 --> 2101.2799999999997
allergic to that

2098.16 --> 2103.48
like especially in public I mean yeah

2101.28 --> 2104.6800000000003
oneon-one a woman could probably make me

2103.48 --> 2110.119
do like

2104.68 --> 2110.1189999999997
anything but not in public definitely

2117.88 --> 2123.2000000000003
not Mr wo referring to okay fine while

2121.24 --> 2127.2799999999997
he wasn't there it is not the issue of

2123.2 --> 2131.04
the day tet yeah because I didn't kick

2127.28 --> 2131.0400000000004
Mr wble out of my chat

2135.77 --> 2138.809
[Music]

2142.119 --> 2148.44
yesterday so it's just

2145.28 --> 2150.3590000000004
that yeah I know he gifted me a T-shirt

2148.44 --> 2153.2400000000002
and he supported me and all that it's

2150.359 --> 2158.64
been great and then he started to act

2153.24 --> 2161.319
like he's my wife and that's not great

2158.64 --> 2163.56
like it's literally like trying to

2161.319 --> 2166.2799999999997
correct my

2163.56 --> 2168.48
behavior like he's my parent and I'm a

2166.28 --> 2170.599
little kid that's misbehaving and he's

2168.48 --> 2175.92
like oh yeah I'll just correct that for

2170.599 --> 2175.92
you I'm like what the [ __ ] man [ __ ]

2181.64 --> 2186.8799999999997
off and he didn't do that yesterday or

2184.76 --> 2191.28
anything but he has that tendency and

2186.88 --> 2191.28
does do that and it's not getting any

2191.56 --> 2197.96
less and so it's like yeah I don't know

2195.319 --> 2200.7599999999998
it got too close or something and now

2197.96 --> 2205.68
it's all that entangled [ __ ] from the

2200.76 --> 2205.6800000000003
inside refuses to to

2215.68 --> 2218.68
retract

2223.88 --> 2226.319
right

2228.64 --> 2236.5989999999997
and yeah I mean is that it nothing else

2233.839 --> 2239.88
hey if you all just think I'm a total

2236.599 --> 2242.0

2242.0 --> 2248.48
it just tell me

2245.599 --> 2250.88
then

2248.48 --> 2253.119
I'm I'm just trying to address it I just

2250.88 --> 2255.839
want things to be addressed I don't want

2253.119 --> 2261.4
people to just not say anything

2255.839 --> 2264.2
ever yeah just be careful with the damn

2261.4 --> 2266.8
timing if you're noticing that I'm like

2264.2 --> 2269.56
getting agitated that's not the time Oh

2266.8 --> 2271.1600000000003
that's oh Arn's getting kind of agitated

2269.56 --> 2272.64

2272.64 --> 2279.16

2348.119 --> 2353.839
okay all right anyway yeah I'm very glad

2350.64 --> 2355.5989999999997
to see many people I I actually thought

2353.839 --> 2358.599
that like nobody was going to show up

2355.599 --> 2362.0
today because of yesterday but that's

2358.599 --> 2364.6400000000003
just projection because I felt bad and

2362.0 --> 2366.28
when I feel bad about something I always

2364.64 --> 2368.1189999999997
think that everybody hates me and that

2366.28 --> 2370.76
they not going to show up because this

2368.119 --> 2372.88
time Arn went too far now we really

2370.76 --> 2376.44
don't like him anymore I actually think

2372.88 --> 2378.76
that because guess what that actually

2376.44 --> 2382.319
used to happen to

2378.76 --> 2385.5600000000004
me when I was

2382.319 --> 2389.68
younger and it's kind of hard to

2385.56 --> 2392.96
like not have that Echo back on me every

2389.68 --> 2394.8799999999997
time something like this

2392.96 --> 2398.4
happens all right anyway I'm going to

2394.88 --> 2398.4
get my coffee I'll be right back

2425.359 --> 2428.359
for

2448.68 --> 2452.319
right for a change I'm actually having

2450.839 --> 2457.839
my coffee in

2452.319 --> 2459.7599999999998
this because the drip soly br broke my

2457.839 --> 2461.24
coffee cup just like that it didn't even

2459.76 --> 2463.3190000000004
like fall or anything just like I

2461.24 --> 2465.8799999999997
grabbed it and just like

2463.319 --> 2468.2799999999997
whoop so I have to glue that on before I

2465.88 --> 2471.92
can use it

2468.28 --> 2474.6400000000003
again I think that happened like six

2471.92 --> 2474.64
years ago

2477.0 --> 2484.88
too I mean that cup is like 35 years old

2482.48 --> 2488.64
or something not even joking it's crazy

2484.88 --> 2488.6400000000003
old so yeah I'm

2489.68 --> 2494.839
quite quite careful with

2492.56 --> 2498.599
them all right but for

2494.839 --> 2498.599
now it's in this

2512.4 --> 2517.1600000000003
thing what Nathan is premiering during

2515.599 --> 2520.1600000000003
his live show

2517.16 --> 2520.16
though

2527.56 --> 2532.16
what I don't know what's going on over

2536.68 --> 2541.359
there you download a volume

2544.28 --> 2550.6800000000003
booster okay

2547.04 --> 2550.68
is my sound low or

2556.4 --> 2563.48
something are you saying that for a long

2559.16 --> 2563.48
time you felt that was

2563.96 --> 2572.079
being that that what what what what do

2568.28 --> 2574.8390000000004
you mean that was being gay to you what

2572.079 --> 2577.8390000000004
that's not a sentence who are you

2574.839 --> 2580.92
talking that he

2577.839 --> 2583.7999999999997
he maybe I don't know what the hell that

2580.92 --> 2586.4
was but with steamy traveler whatever it

2583.8 --> 2589.88
was there seemed to be like certain uh

2586.4 --> 2592.2000000000003
feelings coming through with

2589.88 --> 2595.4
him

2592.2 --> 2599.52
that like they don't mix well with me

2595.4 --> 2603.359
like it felt like he came too close in a

2599.52 --> 2605.92
way and it wasn't even like gay or

2603.359 --> 2610.0789999999997
anything I think it was more like a sort

2605.92 --> 2610.079
of a weird parent feeling or

2610.96 --> 2617.96
something I don't know but it really got

2614.839 --> 2617.96
on my nerves at

2627.359 --> 2633.92
times got sick and then it went away I

2630.52 --> 2636.96
got a massive headache yesterday

2633.92 --> 2639.2000000000003
man like during the show too I had a

2636.96 --> 2643.359
headache it was it was just not like I

2639.2 --> 2646.04
would go but it was just like this thing

2643.359 --> 2649.2
that's just sitting there it's like just

2646.04 --> 2650.88
in the way so I was having all kinds of

2649.2 --> 2660.0699999999997
issues

2650.88 --> 2660.07
[Music]

2660.48 --> 2668.0
yesterday right I guess clutch you had

2663.559 --> 2668.0
hey good to see you by the way

2668.76 --> 2674.599
but you had a like a

2671.359 --> 2674.5989999999997
migraine last

2687.079 --> 2692.48
time even Q said that he got the

2690.0 --> 2695.319
symptoms yes teret that's a very

2692.48 --> 2697.2400000000002
perceptive thing to say because it is

2695.319 --> 2700.92
happening it it's Christmas time and in

2697.24 --> 2702.9199999999996
Christmas time something weird starts to

2700.92 --> 2705.599
happen it's

2702.92 --> 2708.44
like the ancestral

2705.599 --> 2711.3590000000004
wind did you guys forget about that me

2708.44 --> 2715.16
ex the I called it the ancestral wind I

2711.359 --> 2715.16
talked about that years

2715.96 --> 2722.7200000000003
back there's like a higher tension

2718.92 --> 2726.04
energy passing through Christmas

2722.72 --> 2728.0789999999997
time and if you're like in a dark place

2726.04 --> 2730.64
things go terribly

2728.079 --> 2732.559
wrong and if you're in a light place

2730.64 --> 2736.24
then you

2732.559 --> 2738.2400000000002
like you can get through it but there

2736.24 --> 2740.839
you will notice other people breaking

2738.24 --> 2743.64
down and all that but it just typically

2740.839 --> 2746.16
happens it's like the whole thing of

2743.64 --> 2748.64
like Oh Christmas dinner somebody going

2746.16 --> 2750.7999999999997
berserk like getting like oh that's the

2748.64 --> 2753.92
final drop and they go like totally off

2750.8 --> 2755.559
or whatever on a family member like why

2753.92 --> 2757.48
everybody's always like why the [ __ ]

2755.559 --> 2761.48
does that always happened during

2757.48 --> 2763.76
Christmas well because of the energies

2761.48 --> 2766.839
that are there during Christmas and

2763.76 --> 2771.28
arguably Christmas and all the lights

2766.839 --> 2775.44
and all happy happy happy happy is there

2771.28 --> 2778.6400000000003
specifically like a spell to try to keep

2775.44 --> 2781.44
you happy in a time where you're

2778.64 --> 2783.7599999999998
basically the most vulnerable to demonic

2781.44 --> 2787.559
possession in that

2783.76 --> 2788.96
moment everybody becomes more vulnerable

2787.559 --> 2791.3190000000004
to

2788.96 --> 2795.079
possession so if there's something that

2791.319 --> 2799.04
gets to you it gets to your heart and

2795.079 --> 2803.319
like you won't recognize yourself

2799.04 --> 2805.48
even when that happens because the way

2803.319 --> 2808.079
that your like Spirit Alchemy works the

2805.48 --> 2811.119
way you're used to how you work is

2808.079 --> 2813.4
different during

2811.119 --> 2817.76
Christmas it's different because there's

2813.4 --> 2820.52
a different energy in the air high

2817.76 --> 2825.8
tension it's like a spiritual high

2820.52 --> 2825.8
tension that tends to cause lightning

2827.359 --> 2834.2
spiritually prone to conflict and thus

2830.68 --> 2836.96
all the extra the peace culture like all

2834.2 --> 2840.48
peace on Earth during Christmas and

2836.96 --> 2844.4
peace movies and happy joy and gifts and

2840.48 --> 2848.8
fun and family and warm Hearth right

2844.4 --> 2851.04
it's all there just to help you assist

2848.8 --> 2853.28
preventing getting possessed by

2851.04 --> 2856.24
demons because during Christmas it's

2853.28 --> 2859.6400000000003
like the peak risk like if Christmas

2856.24 --> 2861.9199999999996
completely didn't exist any nothing

2859.64 --> 2865.0
existed then it would be like the most

2861.92 --> 2866.52
depressed time of the world of the of

2865.0 --> 2869.28
the year in the

2866.52 --> 2871.599
world because everybody gets the

2869.28 --> 2874.3590000000004
spiritual tension stuff if there's

2871.599 --> 2876.7200000000003
nothing there to like keep you moralized

2874.359 --> 2879.52
and together

2876.72 --> 2883.2
like Wars and [ __ ] will break out or

2879.52 --> 2885.839
like fighting like there will be like

2883.2 --> 2889.04
scuffles and fights like every freaking

2885.839 --> 2890.96
Christmas then because there is no

2889.04 --> 2892.8
Christmas but there's still the tension

2890.96 --> 2894.76
effect because that just happens it's

2892.8 --> 2896.28
not because oh we're going to dress it

2894.76 --> 2898.5200000000004
up for Christmas that's not what makes

2896.28 --> 2901.76
that tension build up no it's

2898.52 --> 2904.079
astrological it is something that

2901.76 --> 2906.0400000000004
happens because of the phases because of

2904.079 --> 2909.04
the time of the year and and it does

2906.04 --> 2911.68
happen every time and indeed with with

2909.04 --> 2914.52
it the effect also comes these

2911.68 --> 2914.52
unexpected

2915.599 --> 2920.079
headaches like that you can't really

2917.96 --> 2921.92
pinpoint like oh it's because I did this

2920.079 --> 2924.4
or I ate that and it's like no it's just

2921.92 --> 2928.839
like just like out of

2924.4 --> 2931.48
nowhere well that's the tension

2928.839 --> 2934.0789999999997
transition cuz you have to adapt like

2931.48 --> 2935.599
you're tapping into it you have to adapt

2934.079 --> 2937.0
the headache is like a side effect

2935.599 --> 2939.599
effect of like

2937.0 --> 2942.68
changing tracks changing

2939.599 --> 2945.76
railroad where you're going with

2942.68 --> 2947.64
spirit and it's the track that is there

2945.76 --> 2951.0
it's going to be stumbly you're probably

2947.64 --> 2951.0
going to get a headache trying to

2951.4 --> 2956.76
adapt

2953.0 --> 2960.319
right animals yeah I'll tell you what

2956.76 --> 2964.2000000000003
DED I think animals have the same effect

2960.319 --> 2966.5589999999997
I think animals are also subjected to

2964.2 --> 2968.52
this not just

2966.559 --> 2970.6800000000003
people all right anyway I'm going to

2968.52 --> 2974.16
take a bite of my Illuminati cons before

2970.68 --> 2974.16
it's completely cold so

2985.44 --> 2992.7200000000003
cheers now I

2988.64 --> 2992.72
remember I did watch a movie on

2993.119 --> 2999.7200000000003
Netflix but it didn't really get my full

2997.52 --> 3003.64
attention I watched like a clay

2999.72 --> 3007.5989999999997
animation type movie Chicken

3003.64 --> 3007.5989999999997
Run I'd never seen that

3009.359 --> 3014.839
before it is really

3012.48 --> 3016.88
silly and there's also annoying

3014.839 --> 3020.0499999999997
propaganda in there

3016.88 --> 3023.579
basically but it's not super in your

3020.05 --> 3023.579
[Music]

3024.44 --> 3031.119
face Ian it is very

3027.799 --> 3031.119
entertaining as a

3046.4 --> 3053.1600000000003
movie like I think there was like some

3049.079 --> 3056.76
kind of attempt at vegan propaganda in

3053.16 --> 3058.0789999999997
there but I'm like

3056.76 --> 3061.96
screw

3058.079 --> 3061.96
that chickens are for

3068.28 --> 3073.0
eating it was kind of a weird way to

3070.68 --> 3073.0
look at

3075.68 --> 3078.68
it

3084.359 --> 3087.359
what

3100.24 --> 3104.9199999999996
what all right okay Tommy

3114.359 --> 3117.359
yeah

3124.64 --> 3128.48
he's really who are you talking

3144.28 --> 3147.28
about

3149.2 --> 3154.48
oh okay let me guess he's not a flat

3157.28 --> 3160.6090000000004
[Music]

3174.24 --> 3177.24
earther

3178.799 --> 3182.25

3180.76 --> 3185.789
you

3182.25 --> 3185.789
[Music]

3190.23 --> 3195.329
[Music]

3201.98 --> 3207.16
[Music]

3204.16 --> 3207.16
go

3211.52 --> 3216.92
all right so he's exploding good on him

3214.2 --> 3221.24
nice the only thing that's exploding

3216.92 --> 3223.359
over at my channel are troll

3221.24 --> 3225.9199999999996
comments and I'm not removing them

3223.359 --> 3228.359
anymore I'm done with it they want to

3225.92 --> 3230.96
freaking spam my entire Channel 4 with

3228.359 --> 3233.88
their crap and so be

3230.96 --> 3236.119

3239.119 --> 3245.04
comments nobody else really

3242.04 --> 3245.04
cares

3245.359 --> 3249.359
barely so that's what it is

3250.16 --> 3255.64
then apparently my channel is not really

3252.92 --> 3257.88
comment worthy except for trolls so

3255.64 --> 3257.8799999999997
that's

3259.359 --> 3266.24
it I mean I don't understand why

3262.76 --> 3268.8390000000004
everybody thinks that I wouldn't want a

3266.24 --> 3268.839
comment of

3269.44 --> 3275.28
theirs if they have any that isn't just

3272.72 --> 3275.2799999999997

just any kind of comment I

3365.92 --> 3371.079

3397.96 --> 3405.319

3401.64 --> 3407.839
aroused in people as they're watching it

3405.319 --> 3410.599
by the the time they stop watching it

3407.839 --> 3413.72
like they don't feel the need to like

3410.599 --> 3413.7200000000003
communicate anything

3413.88 --> 3416.88
apparently

3431.319 --> 3438.359
if you comment You' get rolled too

3434.96 --> 3441.0
what you mean rolled by the trolls

3438.359 --> 3441.0

3443.799 --> 3446.799

3505.92 --> 3510.44
because it really does stay a lot warmer

3508.2 --> 3510.4399999999996
like

man could you imagine though what it

3583.599 --> 3586.2400000000002
would be like

3589.48 --> 3594.72
ter if

3591.599 --> 3598.0
like let's just a hyper hypothetical

3594.72 --> 3600.9199999999996
which is probably never going to

3598.0 --> 3603.28
happen that's like

3600.92 --> 3604.119
official like yeah Earth is not a globe

3603.28 --> 3607.92
it's

3604.119 --> 3609.839
official like here are the actual

3607.92 --> 3612.4
measurements

3609.839 --> 3616.119
and like pointing at where there was

3612.4 --> 3618.559
fraud in the past fraud claims who's

3616.119 --> 3621.2400000000002
responsible NASA getting

3618.559 --> 3623.599
shame like by the public like public

3621.24 --> 3625.5589999999997
officials doing that like an official

3623.599 --> 3626.48
thing

3625.559 --> 3629.119
dude

3626.48 --> 3632.799
Ballers all that all that would happen

3629.119 --> 3632.799
is that Ballers would become the new

3633.119 --> 3640.28
sjws you know this is true right you

3637.4 --> 3644.0
know that they will become like

3640.28 --> 3644.0
sjws with their ball

3644.119 --> 3651.4
religion except worse sjws think that

3647.52 --> 3653.68
like all this old way of doing things he

3651.4 --> 3655.4
and she and father and mother like oh

3653.68 --> 3657.0789999999997
that's all in the past we're going to go

3655.4 --> 3659.119
with a new format so that's what they're

3657.079 --> 3663.319
trying to do they're literally trying to

3659.119 --> 3665.7200000000003
do a new way and erase the old way

3663.319 --> 3668.079
that's what sh WS do well the Ballers

3665.72 --> 3669.799
would do exactly that he be like

3668.079 --> 3671.079
everybody's gone crazy they think it's

3669.799 --> 3674.2
flat

3671.079 --> 3677.7200000000003
now and they literally like how do we

3674.2 --> 3680.5989999999997
get everybody to believe it's a ball

3677.72 --> 3683.0789999999997
again they get freaking obsessed with

3680.599 --> 3683.079
that [ __ ]

3683.44 --> 3686.44
dude

3691.44 --> 3696.359
right and that's why I think that in a

3693.96 --> 3699.119
way Globe religion should always be

3696.359 --> 3699.119
allowed

3702.44 --> 3706.16
like allowed some

3709.039 --> 3716.079
room cuz if you're like no it's not

3712.52 --> 3719.0
true and you're like forced say that

3716.079 --> 3722.6800000000003
people will like go genuinely

3719.0 --> 3726.599
insane like they will like if anything

3722.68 --> 3730.8799999999997
gets like people at like

3726.599 --> 3733.2400000000002
attacking people it will be that if if

3730.88 --> 3736.559
you like officially take their ball away

3733.24 --> 3740.72
yeah I mean the people out there they'll

3736.559 --> 3742.3190000000004
let the government like torture you take

3740.72 --> 3746.0
all your rights take all your money

3742.319 --> 3749.0
throw it to some nonsense War

3746.0 --> 3751.319
like force some medical crap on you all

3749.0 --> 3754.359
and everyone will just let it do but if

3751.319 --> 3756.119
that same government told you the Earth

3754.359 --> 3759.96
is

3756.119 --> 3761.92
flat it's not a globe yeah that's when

3759.96 --> 3764.7200000000003
that's when people would actually go

3761.92 --> 3766.319
into Revolution and start blowing up

3764.72 --> 3768.9599999999996
officials

3766.319 --> 3772.359
probably right because you can just all

3768.96 --> 3774.92
be collectively tortured to death and

3772.359 --> 3777.96
all that and poison and the most evil

3774.92 --> 3780.88
maniacal [ __ ] you could imagine could

3777.96 --> 3783.119
take place and worse and worse and worse

3780.88 --> 3786.6800000000003
and everybody was just [ __ ] look at

3783.119 --> 3789.0
it stare at it and do

3786.68 --> 3793.319
nothing as

3789.0 --> 3796.079
usual yeah but as soon as those same

3793.319 --> 3798.319
people would tell you Earth is not a

3796.079 --> 3799.8390000000004
globe yeah guess what else going to

3798.319 --> 3802.88
happen

3799.839 --> 3807.0389999999998
fullblown Green Beret

3802.88 --> 3809.559
Revolution ch people up with knives and

3807.039 --> 3811.1600000000003
sniper sniping official that's what

3809.559 --> 3814.799
would happen

3811.16 --> 3817.68
then cuz all those people are all

3814.799 --> 3819.799
content to let everybody be tortured to

3817.68 --> 3822.24
death for all they care really oh

3819.799 --> 3825.279
they'll be very uncomfortable about it

3822.24 --> 3828.5589999999997
but they all let it happen all of it

3825.279 --> 3828.559
take that [ __ ] ball

3829.48 --> 3835.359

bets will be off and they will just

3837.079 --> 3844.4100000000003
[ __ ] assassinate people in power

3839.62 --> 3844.41

3845.039 --> 3850.0
then cuz all these ball [ __ ] Tarts

3848.599 --> 3852.6800000000003
they're believing in the ball they're

3850.0 --> 3856.72
holding onto the ball so that nothing

3852.68 --> 3860.2
has to be real yeah that's why it is you

3856.72 --> 3864.359
have the ball so nothing else has to be

3860.2 --> 3867.839
real and they can ignore how everybody

3864.359 --> 3871.64
is just being tortured and and

3867.839 --> 3873.68
horrendous unlimited Horrors are

3871.64 --> 3875.4
Unleashed they can just ignore it

3873.68 --> 3877.68
because the Earth is a ball it doesn't

3875.4 --> 3880.64
really matter take that ball

3877.68 --> 3883.5589999999997
away and they all go

clubs like their bike thieves all of a

3909.88 --> 3915.4
sudden like that's how how far that will

3912.119 --> 3918.52
go if you take their ball away yeah cuz

3915.4 --> 3922.6800000000003
their ball is like their

3918.52 --> 3924.95

3945.16 --> 3948.72
three

3946.0 --> 3951.64
ways either there has to be

3948.72 --> 3954.0789999999997
psychological inoculation in order for

3951.64 --> 3957.799
the ball religion to transform into a

3954.079 --> 3960.88
dual cosmogonical Society understanding

3957.799 --> 3965.359
and have the ball religion as a stable

3960.88 --> 3970.1600000000003
system a toy a mental toy

3965.359 --> 3972.72
within the collective minds of

3970.16 --> 3976.319
civilization and the other option

3972.72 --> 3978.839
is it can't be done they refuse to stop

3976.319 --> 3980.96
trying to dominate and lie to everybody

3978.839 --> 3983.16
and then it will have to be like

3980.96 --> 3985.039
war and then it will have to be

3983.16 --> 3989.72
forbidden and then they will turn into

3985.039 --> 3989.7200000000003
terrorists and then they have to all be

3990.079 --> 3996.2000000000003
exterminated and then after that yeah

3992.559 --> 3999.44

4008.16 --> 4013.0
their religion as a reminder no you

4011.24 --> 4016.9199999999996
[ __ ] erase

it and you hope to God that everybody

4016.92 --> 4022.039
forget that it ever

existed because you don't want that idea

4022.039 --> 4028.2000000000003

religion it's not going to be

4049.279 --> 4056.76
easy right being Mar married to Globe

4053.64 --> 4059.72
earth like that being a globe Earth

4056.76 --> 4061.96
religious person is like being married

4059.72 --> 4066.3999999999996
to a

4061.96 --> 4069.88
model yeah good luck CU it will seem

4066.4 --> 4069.88
amazing until

4070.039 --> 4075.92
like they get a certain state of mind

4073.76 --> 4077.559
and and then they just start to destroy

4075.92 --> 4080.039
you and there's literally nothing you

4077.559 --> 4081.4
can do about it yeah models aren't they

4080.039 --> 4085.3190000000004
just

4081.4 --> 4085.319
lovely right

4094.16 --> 4099.759
yeah the globe religion is a very

4097.199 --> 4103.04
dangerous

4099.759 --> 4104.52
belief cuz people become very dependent

4103.04 --> 4107.719
on it it's like

4104.52 --> 4109.52
Globe religion is like the fental of the

4107.719 --> 4112.56
spiritual

4109.52 --> 4114.1990000000005
world one it's like it's amazing gives

4112.56 --> 4116.400000000001
you all this room it gives you it

4114.199 --> 4119.839
relinquishes all your responsibilities

4116.4 --> 4123.159
and gives you that visceral freedom for

4119.839 --> 4126.679
your ego quite unique in that sense what

4123.159 --> 4129.2789999999995
it does the trick of it but if you then

4126.679 --> 4132.4
become addicted to that state and you're

4129.279 --> 4135.080000000001
going to want to escape the regular

4132.4 --> 4138.199
reality towards that

4135.08 --> 4139.5599999999995
state then you become a a dangerous

4138.199 --> 4143.919999999999
religious

4139.56 --> 4146.52
fanatic with it who's literally going to

4143.92 --> 4150.64
manipulate trick

4146.52 --> 4155.92
cheat blackmail people to get their ways

4150.64 --> 4155.92
with the glob religion like that's what

4162.719 --> 4165.719
happens

4173.799 --> 4180.5199999999995
people in college studying lights would

4176.799 --> 4180.5199999999995
go berserk no they wouldn't go

4184.6 --> 4190.4800000000005
berserk now those people would live they

4187.56 --> 4192.92
would just go depressed yeah but the the

4190.48 --> 4194.919999999999
dumbass astronomers and all that people

4192.92 --> 4198.76
that actually waste their entire life

4194.92 --> 4201.52
being drenched in it they don't have

4198.76 --> 4204.1990000000005
anything they can do nothing when that

4201.52 --> 4205.719
happens nothing they will be completely

4204.199 --> 4207.36
powerless they're not the ones going to

4205.719 --> 4212.4
go

4207.36 --> 4216.719
berserk no it's the other people have

4212.4 --> 4221.04
used the idea of space and the

4216.719 --> 4225.4
medium as leverage over other people and

4221.04 --> 4229.48
as plans like they use it to get people

4225.4 --> 4231.759999999999
to to trust them or whatever right those

4229.48 --> 4234.4
are the people they are the ones that

4231.76 --> 4236.92
are going to go berserk not the the in

4234.4 --> 4239.759999999999
astronomer numpties that think they're

4236.92 --> 4241.8
all special because they do that yeah

4239.76 --> 4243.360000000001
because when they it's revealed when the

4241.8 --> 4246.320000000001
curtains lifted to them they're just

4243.36 --> 4249.239
like wow you're just a useless idiot

4246.32 --> 4250.44
yeah they're not going to go berserk

4249.239 --> 4252.639999999999
they're just going to go look for

4250.44 --> 4254.5199999999995
another

4252.64 --> 4258.76
job

4254.52 --> 4258.76
like a useful job like

4259.32 --> 4265.5599999999995
Plumbing I think all astronomers should

4262.719 --> 4269.12
like they should just

4265.56 --> 4270.159000000001
be offered a plumber job every single

4269.12 --> 4273.12
one of

4270.159 --> 4275.719
them it would be kind of fun to say like

4273.12 --> 4278.08
yeah mandatory Plumbing like oh you were

4275.719 --> 4281.0
you were an astrophysicist you were an

4278.08 --> 4285.36
astronomer okay that's cool well those

4281.0 --> 4289.8
aren't professions anymore so

4285.36 --> 4294.799999999999
yeah here you go become a

4289.8 --> 4294.8
plumber yeah let's clog those

4299.12 --> 4307.4
pipes or unclog those pipes I mean so

4305.0 --> 4310.54
yeah that's my

4307.4 --> 4310.54
[Music]

4312.56 --> 4317.0
recommendation

4314.159 --> 4319.638999999999
Professor Phil Bell maybe he's in no he

4317.0 --> 4321.36
isn't Professor Phil Bell is still doing

4319.639 --> 4323.56
exactly the same thing he's just doing

4321.36 --> 4324.92
it with sock accounts now Professor Phil

4323.56 --> 4328.92
Bell's

4324.92 --> 4333.28
everywhere he just doesn't show himself

4328.92 --> 4333.28
anymore he could be in my chat right

4342.48 --> 4345.48
now

4374.239 --> 4377.959999999999
right but I don't think that the globe's

4376.52 --> 4380.96
not going to be on top I think it's

4377.96 --> 4383.719
going to be on top for Always Forever

4380.96 --> 4386.2390000000005
and it's probably better right as long

4383.719 --> 4387.76
as there's like a like there's an

4386.239 --> 4389.959999999999
understanding like this is the official

4387.76 --> 4392.88
narra the official narrative is it's a

4389.96 --> 4395.08
globe but that it's okay if people say

4392.88 --> 4398.0
that that that's it's wrong that it's a

4395.08 --> 4401.159
lie it's a government lie and that the

4398.0 --> 4404.52
government will literally not respond to

4401.159 --> 4406.44
that if they do that then you have the

4404.52 --> 4407.719
conditions that are ideal for a dual

4406.44 --> 4410.159
cosmogonical

4407.719 --> 4412.28
Society because there will always be a

4410.159 --> 4415.799999999999
situation that can be used by glob

4412.28 --> 4418.28
Believers to repeal on consensus or

4415.8 --> 4421.04
whatever they feel safe enough but

4418.28 --> 4423.759999999999
people that see that it's obviously not

4421.04 --> 4426.92
a ball that know that they don't have to

4423.76 --> 4431.12
be afraid to speak it

4426.92 --> 4431.12
out and that's the ideal

4432.36 --> 4436.759999999999

4434.0 --> 4439.0

4505.159 --> 4511.839999999999

4508.159 --> 4511.839999999999

did

no I don't think it's funny I think it's

4580.76 --> 4585.12
all just waste of time and space

4603.52 --> 4610.120000000001
do you want a longer stream that I need

4606.679 --> 4610.12
a flare

4612.08 --> 4615.08
what

4621.719 --> 4629.4
okay how do you need a flat Earth for a

4625.679 --> 4629.4
longer stream I don't exactly get

4630.6 --> 4635.4800000000005
it it's not like it's an angle or

4639.04 --> 4644.36
anything like an angle to a flat

4642.0 --> 4647.52
Baseline because you're definitely going

4644.36 --> 4647.5199999999995
to need a flat Earth for

4664.639 --> 4669.92
that right but I mean I think that

4667.36 --> 4672.44
Google should actually

4669.92 --> 4674.96
like well I don't know should maybe

4672.44 --> 4677.96
shouldn't even say it but like they

4674.96 --> 4680.32
could potentially do a lot more against

4677.96 --> 4683.56
like spamming trolls and all that

4680.32 --> 4687.759999999999
besides just like typical

4683.56 --> 4691.280000000001
net like net algorithms for the chat to

4687.76 --> 4693.92
to catch typical behaviors and all that

4691.28 --> 4696.719
for the automated system but I'm talking

4693.92 --> 4700.56
about like yeah if somebody's just like

4696.719 --> 4703.44
creating 10 or 20 accounts and like

4700.56 --> 4706.360000000001
messing about with like that is all very

4703.44 --> 4710.28
suspicious activity

4706.36 --> 4713.719
like why don't they go figure out

4710.28 --> 4716.239
that it's like uh yeah if a person is

4713.719 --> 4718.8
literally like [ __ ] around with 10

4716.239 --> 4723.12
different accounts within the time span

4718.8 --> 4726.400000000001
of an hour that's highly

4723.12 --> 4726.4
suspicious and

4728.32 --> 4731.5199999999995
detectable you

4731.639 --> 4737.88
know they should like get a flag for

4734.92 --> 4740.32
that activity and then after a

4737.88 --> 4742.12
while I mean you wouldn't even need a

4740.32 --> 4745.4
person for that you could just have an

4742.12 --> 4747.88
algorithm analyze those patterns and

4745.4 --> 4750.239
then realize this person doesn't

4747.88 --> 4753.2390000000005
actually make YouTube account YouTube

4750.239 --> 4755.48

4753.239 --> 4759.159
YouTube accounts that he makes a

4755.48 --> 4761.839999999999

Pleasant and calm then they'll just call

6058.96 --> 6063.4800000000005
it the Calm before the

6061.199 --> 6065.199
storm cuz whatever the weather is going

6063.48 --> 6067.759999999999
to be it's going to be something you

6065.199 --> 6072.638999999999
have to panic over so that you'll give

6067.76 --> 6072.639
them all your power and money and kill

6073.24 --> 6076.41
[Music]

6079.84 --> 6082.84
yourself

6091.48 --> 6098.199
they never sees this Sease to

6094.8 --> 6098.1990000000005
capitalize okay

6107.28 --> 6111.88
what call before the St yeah but of

6109.8 --> 6113.84
course it is it's like oh it's such

6111.88 --> 6115.639
beautiful weather yeah that means it's

6113.84 --> 6118.04
just a cal before the storm because it's

6115.639 --> 6119.04
just the climate change is going to hit

6118.04 --> 6122.76
soon

6119.04 --> 6125.679
and it's just a come before the storm we

6122.76 --> 6129.04
don't give them all our money

6125.679 --> 6132.1990000000005
now then we won't be able to handle the

6129.04 --> 6132.199
storm after this

6134.08 --> 6138.4
come typ don't worry about

6139.76 --> 6143.639
it

6141.599 --> 6145.639
then the weather channels could Panic

6143.639 --> 6148.2390000000005
could be just

6145.639 --> 6150.84
yeah but I mean all they have to do is

6148.239 --> 6154.879999999999
just they just take the map then they

6150.84 --> 6154.88
just draw a picture of

6155.44 --> 6160.08
like like an

6157.56 --> 6163.92
icape it's like oh my God we're all

6160.08 --> 6165.88
freezing and they just take the map of

6163.92 --> 6168.679
America or Europe or whatever and then

6165.88 --> 6171.36
they just draw ice and snow on it and

6168.679 --> 6172.96
blizzards and it's like it's so cold

6171.36 --> 6175.36
it's so cold and then it's summer it's

6172.96 --> 6178.28
like oh my God it's all burning it's all

6175.36 --> 6181.159
bright red and we're all burning like

6178.28 --> 6185.5599999999995
yeah that's called Summer it's just

6181.159 --> 6187.5199999999995
warmer but they just draw like oh warm

6185.56 --> 6190.159000000001
means we're going to just put like

6187.52 --> 6193.2390000000005
pictures of actual fires there

6190.159 --> 6196.799999999999
everywhere like pictures of lava flows

6193.239 --> 6199.48
and and burning forests and bushes and

6196.8 --> 6201.639
smoke and we then just use that as a

6199.48 --> 6203.4
background image

6201.639 --> 6205.639
for the

6203.4 --> 6207.4
temperature indicator on their weather

6205.639 --> 6209.08
predictions we just use those pictures

6207.4 --> 6212.199
of Everything Is

6209.08 --> 6214.5199999999995
Burning to indicate that just little

6212.199 --> 6216.638999999999
Notch tell like yeah maybe it's a little

6214.52 --> 6219.360000000001
worm right everything's on fire maybe

6216.639 --> 6222.04
it's a little worm this is not

6219.36 --> 6223.719
manipulative suggestion it's not a

6222.04 --> 6226.719
manipulative

6223.719 --> 6229.56
suggestion it's just like showing you

6226.719 --> 6232.36
like buildings and forests on fire I

6229.56 --> 6234.490000000001
mean it's not s gestive or anything

6232.36 --> 6237.589999999999
right it's just a little

6234.49 --> 6237.59
[Music]

[Music]

6241.239 --> 6244.239
worm

6252.76 --> 6258.400000000001
what what does that mean ter what what

6255.8 --> 6258.400000000001
are you talking

6259.599 --> 6265.93
about

6261.34 --> 6265.93
[Music]

6266.76 --> 6274.2390000000005
are the planetary Motions like clockwork

6271.52 --> 6277.76
deterministic

6274.239 --> 6277.759999999999
uh what does that

6278.32 --> 6285.239
mean if deterministic stands for yeah

6282.159 --> 6287.04
consistent and predictable then I guess

6285.239 --> 6289.32
that is what it

6287.04 --> 6293.56
is cuz

6289.32 --> 6296.44
yeah the planetary motions are extremely

6293.56 --> 6299.400000000001
predictable all of it is

6296.44 --> 6301.119
predictable and you can there yeah if

6299.4 --> 6303.48
you understand how they move then you

6301.119 --> 6305.88
can predict ahead of time what they're

6303.48 --> 6305.879999999999
going to be

6319.48 --> 6322.48
doing

6332.119 --> 6338.759999999999
70s we would get super geometric

6336.04 --> 6341.48
snowflakes what what do you mean you

6338.76 --> 6341.4800000000005
don't get them

6349.48 --> 6354.879999999999
anymore

6351.679 --> 6356.36
we can talk this to I don't understand I

thank you very much I really appreciate

6530.159 --> 6532.5599999999995
apprciate

6533.679 --> 6537.76
that I didn't think I was Des deserving

6536.56 --> 6541.320000000001
of that

6537.76 --> 6542.88
yesterday but uh I mean yeah today is a

6541.32 --> 6546.5199999999995
nice show

6542.88 --> 6546.52
I not going to get

6547.76 --> 6552.400000000001
Rowdy yesterday just didn't really work

6553.159 --> 6560.44
out and hey I still thought

6556.44 --> 6562.879999999999
that I was just bickery and Moody and

6560.44 --> 6566.04
agitated and then I just kind of use

6562.88 --> 6569.679
that to like point

6566.04 --> 6572.36
out detail flaws and opinions about the

6569.679 --> 6576.08
whole Tron movie which was not very

6572.36 --> 6578.759999999999
appreciated at the time right

6576.08 --> 6580.92
tet you were counting the amounts of

6578.76 --> 6583.159000000001
times I brought it up so you did not

6580.92 --> 6586.52
like that for some

6583.159 --> 6588.28
reason Oh I thought that I made actually

6586.52 --> 6590.88
Fantastical

6588.28 --> 6593.92
points about the movie

6590.88 --> 6596.56
and I bet that the actual makers of the

6593.92 --> 6598.08
Dron Legacy if they would hear that they

6596.56 --> 6602.2390000000005
would be

6598.08 --> 6606.08
shocked and actually got it because what

6602.239 --> 6608.959999999999
I pointed out about it is just really

6606.08 --> 6612.159
correct and overlooked and even

6608.96 --> 6614.96
overlooked by dumbass internet

6612.159 --> 6617.04
reviewers that make YouTube videos about

6614.96 --> 6619.52
oh comparing the movies like they just

6617.04 --> 6621.44
don't get the first one they don't get

6619.52 --> 6624.52
it they don't don't get it they don't

6621.44 --> 6625.638999999999
get that first movie almost nobody gets

6624.52 --> 6627.88
that first

6625.639 --> 6632.04
movie they didn't get it when it came

6627.88 --> 6636.2390000000005
out then and they're not going to get it

6632.04 --> 6639.679
now cuz you have you have to actually be

6636.239 --> 6642.239
really smart to get it cuz it's not all

6639.679 --> 6643.8
just shoved in your face with Billboards

6642.239 --> 6646.28
like this is what it means this is what

6643.8 --> 6649.04
that means no no you have to actually

6646.28 --> 6652.04
have a brain and figure it

6649.04 --> 6652.04
out

6653.199 --> 6658.239
and if you don't have

6654.96 --> 6662.44
one then it's just going to all just

6658.239 --> 6666.079
seem silly and pointless to

6662.44 --> 6668.32
you right so the review yesterday was

6666.079 --> 6671.36
good I was very happy about that but

6668.32 --> 6675.28
then I got all cranky and

6671.36 --> 6677.239
then ended up yelling and telling stupid

6675.28 --> 6681.96
ass trolls to kill themselves which is

6677.239 --> 6681.959999999999
never good especially around Christmas

6687.159 --> 6692.679
cuz there might be people out there that

6690.44 --> 6695.4
have those issues that are thinking like

6692.679 --> 6698.28
I wish I wasn't here the freaking I hate

6695.4 --> 6699.92
Christmas I hate myself CU like

6698.28 --> 6702.159
everybody should be happy and I'm not

6699.92 --> 6704.159
happy and everybody a lot of people go

6702.159 --> 6705.04
crazy during Christmas and so you should

6704.159 --> 6706.598999999999
just

6705.04 --> 6709.599
never

6706.599 --> 6710.599
mention anything related to Suicide ever

6709.599 --> 6713.8
here

6710.599 --> 6717.079
Christmas yet I did that anyway because

6713.8 --> 6719.84
you know trolls will over my

6717.079 --> 6722.96
ass but to be fair I would have actually

6719.84 --> 6727.28
preferred to not say those things but

6722.96 --> 6731.36
instead actually do those things to

6727.28 --> 6735.0
them and then not verb have had have to

6731.36 --> 6737.5199999999995
burden everybody with ideas like that

6735.0 --> 6741.88
could have just done it to

6737.52 --> 6741.88
them and everybody could just

6746.04 --> 6755.199
yeah not had to endure that

6750.46 --> 6755.199
[Music]

6759.679 --> 6765.119
right thanks for bringing up the what

6762.52 --> 6768.84
why you thinking Adam

6765.119 --> 6771.839999999999
meon I brought it

6768.84 --> 6771.84
up

6774.679 --> 6780.84
I brought it up like on on Wednesday and

6778.0 --> 6783.4
Friday before the ball busters where

6780.84 --> 6786.32
when it became about

6783.4 --> 6789.879999999999
that but of course thank Adam me for

6786.32 --> 6792.09
bringing it up not me been only talking

6789.88 --> 6794.0
about it for years now it's it's

6792.09 --> 6796.88
[Music]

6794.0 --> 6799.32
fine I do also thank him for bringing up

6796.88 --> 6802.679
I do actually think it should probably

6799.32 --> 6805.679
be a subject that we really dive

6802.679 --> 6809.079
into

6805.679 --> 6812.88
because it's like on the level of what

6809.079 --> 6816.5599999999995
physicality assumption bias does to

6812.88 --> 6818.96
people it's difficult it's like a

6816.56 --> 6821.88
complicated obstacle that literally

6818.96 --> 6826.079
nobody can just roll in and get it right

6821.88 --> 6830.1990000000005
right away there's no way absolutely no

6826.079 --> 6831.48
way you're going to get like oh I'm just

6830.199 --> 6833.799999999999
going to roll in there and then it's

6831.48 --> 6836.48
like yeah what what about the four

6833.8 --> 6838.1990000000005
different weights which do you know

6836.48 --> 6840.48
which one is which do you know what that

6838.199 --> 6843.759999999999
is do you know what's going on and then

6840.48 --> 6846.159
they all realize like what the

6843.76 --> 6849.0
[ __ ] why is this so

6846.159 --> 6851.28
complicated yeah yeah that's the point

6849.0 --> 6855.44
that's like the point about

6851.28 --> 6859.48
it it seems like it's all simple but it

6855.44 --> 6862.0
isn't simple in reality it isn't at all

6859.48 --> 6865.678999999999
it's really complicated and weight is

6862.0 --> 6868.719
really complicated and it's not one

6865.679 --> 6871.2390000000005
thing it's all these different angles of

6868.719 --> 6873.04
approach as to what weight is and

6871.239 --> 6874.718999999999
they're all different and they're not

6873.04 --> 6877.8
even fully

6874.719 --> 6881.2390000000005
compatible and that is the complication

6877.8 --> 6884.119000000001
that literally nobody gets like even if

6881.239 --> 6888.5199999999995
you're like a professional physics

6884.119 --> 6891.88
teacher like a good one even then you're

6888.52 --> 6894.119000000001
still going to have problems with this

6891.88 --> 6896.0
even if you like are really good at what

6894.119 --> 6898.88
you do you're going to have problems

6896.0 --> 6902.679
with this because it's such a

6898.88 --> 6907.36
complicated guard Guardian

6902.679 --> 6910.04
knot of detail meaning that's all like

6907.36 --> 6913.5599999999995
it's like yeah waight this is weight

6910.04 --> 6913.56
yeah you figure it out

6918.599 --> 6921.599
yeah

6928.239 --> 6933.44
Adam join to bring it to their attention

6934.84 --> 6943.719
what right I'm glad he did I try to

6940.56 --> 6946.4800000000005
but I don't know when I bring things up

6943.719 --> 6947.88
on fed everybody just completely ignores

6946.48 --> 6951.0
me

6947.88 --> 6953.639
typically it's like one out of it out of

6951.0 --> 6956.159
10 times when I bring up something new

6953.639 --> 6959.2390000000005
somebody else actually listens to it and

6956.159 --> 6960.96
responds to it instead of just

6959.239 --> 6962.5599999999995
completely ignoring it and just

6960.96 --> 6965.639
continuing whatever they were talking

6962.56 --> 6967.719
about before that that is nine out of 10

6965.639 --> 6970.400000000001
times how everybody responds when I

6967.719 --> 6973.28
bring up something new at

6970.4 --> 6976.719
fed now that response rate is

6973.28 --> 6979.639
dramatically lower when adamin brings

6976.719 --> 6981.52
anything up cuz seven out of 10 times

6979.639 --> 6984.76
whenever Adam brings anything up

6981.52 --> 6984.76
everybody responds to

6986.28 --> 6990.759999999999
that I am not so lucky

7008.48 --> 7011.48
though

7031.52 --> 7036.2390000000005
that's why you're giving ad show yeah

7033.04 --> 7036.239
know perfectly

7038.4 --> 7042.949
fine

7039.88 --> 7042.9490000000005
[Music]

7047.8 --> 7053.360000000001
Dam it where's the m key always

7051.19 --> 7058.839999999999
[Music]

7053.36 --> 7058.839999999999
so don't know why the m is getting so so

7059.4 --> 7062.4
hard

7068.4 --> 7071.4
stuck

7081.76 --> 7086.4400000000005
right YouTube's not giving any

7084.119 --> 7088.4
complications OBS is not giving any

7086.44 --> 7090.5199999999995
complications the internet connection is

7088.4 --> 7092.96
not giving any

7090.52 --> 7094.719
complications my mood is not giving any

7092.96 --> 7096.76
complications and not even the trolls

7094.719 --> 7099.639
are giving any complications I guess

7096.76 --> 7100.719
that today is just exactly the opposite

7099.639 --> 7104.400000000001
of

7100.719 --> 7104.4
everything that was there

7105.4 --> 7110.719
yesterday the weather is not even kind

7108.48 --> 7110.718999999999
of

7112.199 --> 7118.638999999999
calm cat came over for a

7115.199 --> 7118.638999999999
visit still

7120.4 --> 7127.119
there all right so yeah peace on Earth

7124.28 --> 7127.119
Merry Christmas

7128.32 --> 7131.32
everybody

7142.44 --> 7146.96
all right and make sure if you're going

7145.0 --> 7149.56
to have like a big Christmas dinner make

7146.96 --> 7149.56
sure to

7150.92 --> 7156.8
like keep as much sugar out of that food

7155.239 --> 7159.5199999999995
as you

7156.8 --> 7161.599
can because most of the time it's really

7159.52 --> 7164.2390000000005
like the sugar

7161.599 --> 7166.679
stuff that's going to like be so

7164.239 --> 7169.4
detrimental to you the next

7166.679 --> 7172.0
day not just getting stuffed with a lot

7169.4 --> 7173.719
of food it's about getting stuffed with

7172.0 --> 7175.679
sugar in that food that's going to

7173.719 --> 7179.719
really do

7175.679 --> 7179.719
damage so keep that in

7180.639 --> 7185.4400000000005
mind right and hey traditionally with

7183.599 --> 7188.2390000000005
traditional Christmas food yeah there

7185.44 --> 7192.638999999999
are like sugary things there

7188.239 --> 7194.759999999999
too just keep your hands of it or I

7192.639 --> 7197.679
don't know like tell the wife maybe less

7194.76 --> 7199.679
sugary things I always advise to have

7197.679 --> 7203.1990000000005
less sugary things around

7199.679 --> 7204.88
Christmas cuz every time I there was a

7203.199 --> 7207.638999999999
Christmas dinner and there was something

7204.88 --> 7211.2390000000005
sweet I'd get more addicted to those

7207.639 --> 7213.52
sweet and then it would hurt me more

7211.239 --> 7215.48
afterward it's like I'm even more

7213.52 --> 7218.159000000001
sensitive to Sugar around

7215.48 --> 7222.28
Christmas and it hurts

7218.159 --> 7226.04
more so you got to be careful with

7222.28 --> 7230.84
that right stuffing yourself with a lot

7226.04 --> 7234.4
is not Ed bad for you as if you stuffed

7230.84 --> 7235.88
yourself with a lot that has sugar in it

7234.4 --> 7239.04
because then it's the sugar that's

7235.88 --> 7239.04
really going to do most the

7240.679 --> 7246.76
damage

7242.52 --> 7252.0
right you're getting fat later it's

7246.76 --> 7255.719
okay well you know I eat plenty of

7252.0 --> 7258.56
fat and you don't get fat from

7255.719 --> 7261.76
fat like why do you get fat from eating

7258.56 --> 7265.4800000000005
a pie it's not because there's fat in

7261.76 --> 7268.4400000000005
the pie it's because there's sugar in

7265.48 --> 7272.44
the pie it's the sugar that actually

7268.44 --> 7274.839999999999
makes you fat yeah take fat you take

7272.44 --> 7277.5599999999995
sugar you have a very typical

7274.84 --> 7280.28
combination and you get fat what do you

7277.56 --> 7283.52
get fat from not from the fat you get

7280.28 --> 7287.48
fat from the sugar in the fat because

7283.52 --> 7287.4800000000005
fat doesn't actually make you

7289.599 --> 7293.159000000001
fat how about

7295.239 --> 7302.5199999999995
that yeah I eat a lot of fat do you see

7299.079 --> 7302.5199999999995
me getting fat

7303.0 --> 7308.04
no Whatever Gets you fat I'm

7306.4 --> 7309.679
doing

7308.04 --> 7311.679
okay

7309.679 --> 7314.4
Well yeah if you eat plenty of chocolate

7311.679 --> 7314.4
that's going to do

7322.079 --> 7327.84
it because yeah chocolate has a lot of

7324.719 --> 7330.159
sugar in it too but all I'm saying is is

7327.84 --> 7331.76
that it's not actually the fat in the

7330.159 --> 7335.199
food that makes you

7331.76 --> 7335.1990000000005
fat it's the

7336.0 --> 7341.8
sugar that's that's the actual thing

7339.239 --> 7341.799999999999
that does the

7363.36 --> 7368.32
damage right yeah but for today I'm yeah

7366.76 --> 7369.8
I'm still going to have pretty nice

7368.32 --> 7372.88
dinner

7369.8 --> 7375.679
not I'm already through the chili I ate

7372.88 --> 7377.56
double portion yesterday cuz I thought

7375.679 --> 7381.679
like I'm not going to eat another day of

7377.56 --> 7383.2390000000005
chili it was great when it was there but

7381.679 --> 7387.76
I'm kind of done

7383.239 --> 7391.839999999999
now 3 days was enough was great though

7387.76 --> 7394.76
and every time I had a meal like my head

7391.84 --> 7396.32
exploded it was really hot chil and I

7394.76 --> 7400.400000000001
loved

7396.32 --> 7404.44
it but three days is

7400.4 --> 7406.799999999999
enough and I really also need some meat

7404.44 --> 7409.239
cuz I haven't had meat in those three

7406.8 --> 7412.18
days and I'm just starting to feel it

7409.239 --> 7414.879999999999
like yeah I kind of need it

7412.18 --> 7418.4400000000005
[Music]

7414.88 --> 7421.599
again chili sounds so good

7418.44 --> 7424.119
what okay well if you want to see chili

7421.599 --> 7427.159000000001
then just take yesterday show at the

7424.119 --> 7430.88
very beginning of the beginning start

7427.159 --> 7430.879999999999
and I show you what I made

7431.599 --> 7437.84
was that yesterday or the day

7434.28 --> 7441.639
before no wait I think it's the day

7437.84 --> 7441.639
before the show about

7457.8 --> 7460.8
food

7466.239 --> 7469.879999999999
all right so

7470.36 --> 7477.88
anyhow hope that Christ protects all of

7475.199 --> 7479.839999999999
you but even though I don't think it he

7477.88 --> 7482.4800000000005
actually directly relates to this

7479.84 --> 7485.719
specific date in any

7482.48 --> 7489.919999999999
way doesn't matter

7485.719 --> 7494.159
because he is still very useful for this

7489.92 --> 7496.639
date because of the effects

7494.159 --> 7498.879999999999
remember high tension High spiritual

7496.639 --> 7502.400000000001
tension easy

7498.88 --> 7504.76
agitation like Christ is like his

7502.4 --> 7505.66
influence his energy his wisdom is like

7504.76 --> 7506.96
very

7505.66 --> 7509.8
[Music]

7506.96 --> 7511.52
useful right keep Christ in mind that

7509.8 --> 7514.2390000000005
that would be a good thing to say keep

7511.52 --> 7517.2390000000005
Christ in mind during Christmas not

7514.239 --> 7520.678999999999
because it's his birthday but because

7517.239 --> 7523.32
what he has to offer is very helpful

7520.679 --> 7523.32
during

7528.96 --> 7532.4800000000005
Christmas wouldn't you

7534.0 --> 7539.76
agree right I mean everybody's had

7537.32 --> 7542.159
friction with family members during

7539.76 --> 7545.079000000001
Christmas so it's like Yeah The Prince

7542.159 --> 7547.96
of Peace is that's most helpful if

7545.079 --> 7550.32
anybody like really gets Christ during

7547.96 --> 7552.92
Christmas that's super

7550.32 --> 7555.799999999999
helpful

7552.92 --> 7558.1990000000005
because like agitations just around the

7555.8 --> 7560.079000000001
corner a fight could just break out just

7558.199 --> 7561.638999999999
like that out of nothing where before

7560.079 --> 7564.199
you thought you were like lifelong

7561.639 --> 7568.639
friends and suddenly like boom and now

7564.199 --> 7568.638999999999
it's like we hate each other that just

7570.599 --> 7577.400000000001
happens so keep Christ in mind I'm going

7574.28 --> 7577.4
to put that in the title

7577.599 --> 7585.46
actually

7579.86 --> 7585.46
[Music]

7600.52 --> 7607.029
[Music]

7611.84 --> 7615.92

7616.44 --> 7623.36

7619.88 --> 7627.52
show up I don't know why I'm still

7623.36 --> 7630.32
seeing ah a three okay that's

7627.52 --> 7633.0
better folks just don't register I mean

7630.32 --> 7635.4
every other live show they do and as

7633.0 --> 7638.0
they're being thumbed you see them

7635.4 --> 7639.48
rising live now I don't see it I saw

7638.0 --> 7644.719
Zero

7639.48 --> 7644.718999999999
all the way through the show a zero no

7646.48 --> 7653.839999999999
updates thanks a lot

7650.52 --> 7656.040000000001
YouTube I mean maybe YouTube just wants

7653.84 --> 7657.679
me to go to like YouTube Plus or

7656.04 --> 7660.48
whatever the [ __ ] that's supposed to be

7657.679 --> 7661.679
called they just want me to be to become

7660.48 --> 7665.5199999999995
like a

7661.679 --> 7667.04
regular higher standard paying customer

7665.52 --> 7669.52
I think that's that's the reason why

7667.04 --> 7673.28
they're [ __ ] me over so bad they just

7669.52 --> 7676.559
want me to be a higher quality

7673.28 --> 7679.36
account that

7676.559 --> 7681.1990000000005
paid they want me to be a paid account

7679.36 --> 7683.759999999999
they want me to

7681.199 --> 7686.32
pay for having my

7683.76 --> 7687.4400000000005
show that's that's what YouTube wants

7686.32 --> 7689.5199999999995
they want me

7687.44 --> 7692.678999999999
to

7689.52 --> 7694.400000000001
pay for like a YouTube Plus or whatever

7692.679 --> 7697.2390000000005
it's

7694.4 --> 7700.44
called and I think that that's why

7697.239 --> 7700.44
they're screwing me over

7708.079 --> 7713.599
right YouTube stops you getting

7710.639 --> 7713.599
memberships

7714.0 --> 7719.92
what

7716.119 --> 7719.92
how how does that even

7722.639 --> 7726.76
work hello YouTube by the

7727.4 --> 7730.4
way

7733.159 --> 7738.04
you just never get one oh okay so you

7736.119 --> 7742.239
never get

7738.04 --> 7744.96
picked it's weird man I don't understand

7742.239 --> 7747.48
YouTube is like really

7744.96 --> 7749.04
weird and they just like people that

7747.48 --> 7750.48
hang around even though everybody's

7749.04 --> 7752.36
talking with them they just get

7750.48 --> 7755.5199999999995
designated as like yeah you're an

7752.36 --> 7757.839999999999
unwelcome person even though everybody

7755.52 --> 7760.4800000000005
seems to be knowing you and talk with

7757.84 --> 7763.119000000001
you but YouTube then just decides like

7760.48 --> 7766.5199999999995
yeah you're not actually a real

7763.119 --> 7768.92
person it just does that do anybody else

7766.52 --> 7770.76
noticed like YouTube Just decides with

7768.92 --> 7772.719
certain people like you're not really

7770.76 --> 7774.0
people even though everybody accepts

7772.719 --> 7776.4
that as real

7774.0 --> 7779.0
people and then things just don't work

7776.4 --> 7784.0
for those accounts like I got this with

7779.0 --> 7785.52
lumpy gas in a vacuum I can't see lumpy

7784.0 --> 7788.92
gas in a

7785.52 --> 7791.320000000001
vacuum anywhere it's like he's blocked

7788.92 --> 7793.599
to me but he isn't blocked to me he's

7791.32 --> 7796.04
not in the block list he's not in any

7793.599 --> 7799.4800000000005
ban list I just can't see him I

7796.04 --> 7802.04
literally have to like change my account

7799.48 --> 7804.799999999999
to our Winan bear and then suddenly I

7802.04 --> 7809.079
can see him

7804.8 --> 7811.28
again now can anybody explain that to me

7809.079 --> 7814.92
why that

7811.28 --> 7817.639
is cuz lumpy gas in a vacuum and me

7814.92 --> 7820.52
certainly can't we certainly cannot do

7817.639 --> 7820.52
that we don't get

7821.559 --> 7829.04
it YouTube might be racial profiling

7825.28 --> 7832.84
now maybe man maybe I don't know what

7829.04 --> 7837.44
the [ __ ] it's it thinks it's

7832.84 --> 7841.28
doing but there is like this

7837.44 --> 7845.04
weird Rifts that are created like

7841.28 --> 7849.0
technological buggy Rifts that make no

7845.04 --> 7850.44
sense cannot be explained logically

7849.0 --> 7852.36
yet it keeps

7850.44 --> 7856.678999999999
happening like

7852.36 --> 7859.88
meddling like almost like hacker likee

7856.679 --> 7862.4400000000005
meddling from YouTube itself it just

7859.88 --> 7864.84
meddles without even telling that it's

7862.44 --> 7864.839999999999
doing

7867.159 --> 7872.638999999999
that yeah YouTube is super creepy it's

7869.92 --> 7875.4
like a super creepy ped

7872.639 --> 7876.76
guy it's like no no everything is fine

7875.4 --> 7878.92
we're just oh we have a reputable

7876.76 --> 7881.4800000000005
business and everything's fine but you

7878.92 --> 7886.52
catch them in a dark corner and suddenly

7881.48 --> 7886.5199999999995
they got grabby on you that's

7886.8 --> 7893.079000000001
YouTube YouTube the dirty

7891.079 --> 7895.28
groper yeah it's like oh it's a

7893.079 --> 7897.84
fantastic reputable person and then

7895.28 --> 7900.16
nobody looks and then starts groping

7897.84 --> 7903.33
you that's

7900.16 --> 7903.33
[Music]

7907.159 --> 7910.159
YouTube

7917.0 --> 7922.28
promoter of b Entertainment yeah but you

7920.44 --> 7927.44
can't just attribute that just to

7922.28 --> 7929.509999999999
YouTube I mean I'm sorry YouTube name a

7927.44 --> 7933.04
platform that doesn't do

7929.51 --> 7936.04
[Music]

7933.04 --> 7938.119
that they are out there but yeah that

7936.04 --> 7941.36
takes some time to think right takes

7938.119 --> 7944.558999999999
sometime that Think Like H which you

7941.36 --> 7947.4
Which social media platform doesn't do

7944.559 --> 7949.559
that H yeah you have to kind of like

7947.4 --> 7952.48
take your time to think through it all

7949.559 --> 7956.159000000001
right until you stumble upon something

7952.48 --> 7959.558999999999
yeah none that matter

7956.159 --> 7962.759999999999
exactly they're all shitty entertainment

7959.559 --> 7966.52
dude like have you seen

7962.76 --> 7970.04
Rumble and I've said this before Rumble

7966.52 --> 7970.040000000001
is worse

7970.159 --> 7979.0
the [ __ ] that's drifting on there is

7975.119 --> 7984.5199999999995
like I'd say it's very rough estimation

7979.0 --> 7987.84
but it is like 20 to 40% IQ points lower

7984.52 --> 7990.4800000000005
on average than what I bump into on

7987.84 --> 7992.119000000001
YouTube including the [ __ ] things on

7990.48 --> 7995.0
YouTube

7992.119 --> 7996.88
yeah the [ __ ] that's like being

7995.0 --> 8001.84
presented and shoved in your face on

7996.88 --> 8006.079
Rumble is so mind blowingly

8001.84 --> 8011.28
dumb you can't help but think that it's

8006.079 --> 8015.28
a [ __ ] magnet they just want the dumb

8011.28 --> 8017.4
people like the dumb people that just

8015.28 --> 8019.92
have to be dumb they have to say their

8017.4 --> 8024.199
dumb things it's like oh Rumble doesn't

8019.92 --> 8026.84
censor you if you want to be a [ __ ]

8024.199 --> 8028.759999999999
[ __ ] Rumble won't censor you if you

8026.84 --> 8031.76
want to say the plat udes and the

8028.76 --> 8034.4800000000005
outdated shitty arguments that don't

8031.76 --> 8036.2390000000005
really work anymore you want to be free

8034.48 --> 8039.32
you can do it on Rumble you'll look like

8036.239 --> 8041.159
a complete [ __ ] but I mean that's

8039.32 --> 8044.119
exactly the

8041.159 --> 8046.96
audience so you'll be very much welcome

8044.119 --> 8050.679
you just have to be a complete inep

8046.96 --> 8053.36
[ __ ] and probably a closeted [ __ ] or

8050.679 --> 8055.599
just an overt [ __ ] and you'll do great

8053.36 --> 8055.598999999999
on

8055.8 --> 8062.2390000000005
Rumble yeah right-wing dementia

8058.76 --> 8065.88
programming well said slow-mo it is it

8062.239 --> 8067.919999999999
[ __ ] is this not freedom of speech is

8065.88 --> 8073.32
[ __ ]

8067.92 --> 8075.4800000000005
garbage rightwing [ __ ] garbage tropes

8073.32 --> 8078.558999999999
shitty shitty ass

8075.48 --> 8083.079
tropes that don't even belong with a

8078.559 --> 8085.320000000001
person of of your configuration yeah the

8083.079 --> 8088.84
people that use these tropes on their

8085.32 --> 8091.599
channels they're so [ __ ] [ __ ] and

8088.84 --> 8094.599
gay and just

8091.599 --> 8096.84
delusional those tropes don't even fit

8094.599 --> 8096.84
with

8098.48 --> 8104.759999999999
them it's

8101.48 --> 8107.04
unbelievable I think Rumble is worse

8104.76 --> 8107.04
than

8108.32 --> 8114.0
YouTube and I

8110.48 --> 8117.36
mean maybe I should like Comm like

8114.0 --> 8118.44
contact like the YouTube team that's

8117.36 --> 8121.119
like

8118.44 --> 8123.799999999999
and just ask him like how did you manage

8121.119 --> 8127.0
not to become as [ __ ] as Rumble I

8123.8 --> 8130.04
want to know how you did that because if

8127.0 --> 8132.719
I ever like have my own

8130.04 --> 8135.8
private website or whatever on which I

8132.719 --> 8138.84
have videos kind of like Matt Quantum of

8135.8 --> 8139.96
conscious has free.io well if I have

8138.84 --> 8143.360000000001
like my own

8139.96 --> 8147.159
free.io I want YouTube

8143.36 --> 8150.558999999999
algorithm because otherwise my thing

8147.159 --> 8153.679
might turn as [ __ ] as

8150.559 --> 8157.4800000000005
Rumble and I never wanted become as dumb

8153.679 --> 8160.4800000000005
as Rumble yeah never go full

8157.48 --> 8160.48
Rumble

8163.639 --> 8172.119
never you know what I mean and yes that

8167.36 --> 8172.119
should be a saying never go full

8176.719 --> 8181.8
Rumble

8179.44 --> 8184.48
yeah I know what you mean right you get

8181.8 --> 8186.52
[ __ ] just looking at the thumbnails

8184.48 --> 8191.36
just look at

8186.52 --> 8194.359
it the rumble front page like you take a

8191.36 --> 8196.92
snapshot of that then you go watch the

8194.359 --> 8200.319
movie Idiocracy and you keep the

8196.92 --> 8202.479
snapshot of the rumble front page on the

8200.319 --> 8204.88
other screen right next to the movie

8202.479 --> 8207.08
playing and you keep watching back and

8204.88 --> 8208.639
forth you know what you'll start to

8207.08 --> 8211.359
notice

8208.639 --> 8213.518999999998
you can't tell the

8211.359 --> 8217.04
difference and you think that's meant as

8213.519 --> 8221.960000000001
a joke right no no that's not meant as a

8217.04 --> 8223.599
joke you genuinely won't be able to tell

8221.96 --> 8226.919999999998
the

8223.599 --> 8229.76
difference between the front page of

8226.92 --> 8233.2
Rumble and the [ __ ] that you're seeing

8229.76 --> 8236.599
in Idiocracy the movie you will not be

8233.2 --> 8239.599
able to tell the difference I guarantee

8236.599 --> 8239.599
it

8243.28 --> 8249.639000000001
yeah and I mean how dare you it's the

8247.0 --> 8253.08
last Bion of Hope and free speech for

8249.639 --> 8256.639
absolute [ __ ] retards that have no

8253.08 --> 8259.559
future yeah I agree and I do appreciate

8256.639 --> 8261.679
Rumble for being an available platform

8259.559 --> 8264.479
and who knows maybe one day I will

8261.679 --> 8268.479
stream on Rumble although I'll doubt

8264.479 --> 8272.16
I'll be very popular there because

8268.479 --> 8276.039999999999
I don't know absolutely idiocracy

8272.16 --> 8279.8
abysmal retards just tend to not like me

8276.04 --> 8284.319000000001
so I don't think I do very well on

8279.8 --> 8287.039999999999
Rumble but I do appreciate that despite

8284.319 --> 8290.479
them being full-blown

8287.04 --> 8293.599
retards like the content that they have

8290.479 --> 8296.559
typically I do appreciate that they

8293.599 --> 8299.960000000001
are like that their mission is to

8296.559 --> 8303.16
literally give everybody room to speak

8299.96 --> 8306.119999999999
that is admirable even though it leads

8303.16 --> 8308.88
to the realization that the vast

8306.12 --> 8311.880000000001
majority of people in the world are

8308.88 --> 8311.88
irredeemably

8312.399 --> 8318.24
[ __ ] right but I mean hey it's just

8315.08 --> 8320.519
the revelation of the truth you know if

8318.24 --> 8322.519
that's what happens when you have actual

8320.519 --> 8324.960000000001
Free Speech oh yeah actual Free Speech

8322.519 --> 8327.12
yeah now you get to see how [ __ ] dumb

8324.96 --> 8329.518999999998
the world really is that's what that

8327.12 --> 8329.519
means

8331.639 --> 8338.399
and I do appreciate Rumble for having

8334.84 --> 8342.04
free speech like that is just maybe you

8338.399 --> 8345.24
could like try to format your platform

8342.04 --> 8347.479000000001
not to just draw in the worst garbage

8345.24 --> 8350.479
people you could

8347.479 --> 8350.479
imagine

8351.599 --> 8357.12
yeah but I don't know what am I talking

8354.8 --> 8359.639
about right maybe they are like no [ __ ]

8357.12 --> 8362.399000000001
you Darwin no we are going to get the

8359.639 --> 8365.399
garbage people you know why because

8362.399 --> 8367.96
there's 100 times more garbage people

8365.399 --> 8371.679
than non garbage people and we want the

8367.96 --> 8374.358999999999
100 times we don't care how absolutely

8371.679 --> 8377.16
[ __ ] that makes it look we want the

8374.359 --> 8381.12
[ __ ] because this world is idiocracy

8377.16 --> 8383.719
and we want the viewing numbers we want

8381.12 --> 8387.240000000002
the Dominate and that means that we

8383.719 --> 8389.56
become the number one [ __ ] channel on

8387.24 --> 8391.92
the the internet cuz if you're the

8389.56 --> 8395.08
number one [ __ ] channel on the

8391.92 --> 8398.16
internet that means you have the most

8395.08 --> 8402.399
viewers in the world because the

8398.16 --> 8404.8
majority of people are irredeemably

8402.399 --> 8407.439
[ __ ] or at least the ones that have

8404.8 --> 8410.438999999998
the need to speak

8407.439 --> 8410.439
out

8411.2 --> 8415.880000000001
right because for some reason people

8413.6 --> 8417.960000000001
that are like irredeemably [ __ ] are

8415.88 --> 8421.8
always the ones that

8417.96 --> 8426.0
feel this need or they they imagine that

8421.8 --> 8426.0
the world needs to hear them speak

8426.52 --> 8430.76
somehow they always think that they

8428.68 --> 8433.52
always think the really dumb people

8430.76 --> 8436.72
think that other people need to hear

8433.52 --> 8439.0
what they have to say don't they happens

8436.72 --> 8439.0
every

8443.399 --> 8450.119999999999
time yeah projection much no I I don't

8446.319 --> 8450.119999999999
think you need to hear me talk at

8450.8 --> 8456.679999999998
all I want to talk I want to share this

8454.6 --> 8457.92
I don't think any everybody needs to

8456.68 --> 8461.880000000001
hear

8457.92 --> 8464.56
this I just want to talk I just want to

8461.88 --> 8466.119999999999
be able to say exactly what I

8464.56 --> 8470.64
think

8466.12 --> 8472.560000000001
and if that means that 99% of people

8470.64 --> 8473.76
that are ever going to see it are going

8472.56 --> 8477.359
to

8473.76 --> 8481.08
be well that just means oh look I

8477.359 --> 8484.399000000001
managed to avoid being popular with the

8481.08 --> 8487.359
majority of [ __ ] people in the world

8484.399 --> 8487.358999999999
I guess I did a good

8495.0 --> 8501.0
job so yeah in this case gratilla not so

8498.08 --> 8503.88
much projection this case it's quite

8501.0 --> 8506.319
quite not so much yeah yesterday when I

8503.88 --> 8508.759999999998
get agitated when I get like really

8506.319 --> 8510.479
angry and rag win and all that yeah

8508.76 --> 8513.16
there's there going to be projection

8510.479 --> 8513.16
there

8513.72 --> 8519.08
definitely that usually happens but I'm

8516.0 --> 8522.0
not agitating right now and there's no

8519.08 --> 8525.8
projection in it yeah I don't have a

8522.0 --> 8530.56
need for everybody to hear

8525.8 --> 8533.199999999999
me yeah if nobody shows up fine I don't

8530.56 --> 8536.24
like to be alone that's separate it's

8533.2 --> 8539.800000000001
not like oh I need everybody to hear me

8536.24 --> 8545.84
no no no I just don't like to be

8539.8 --> 8548.438999999998
alone yeah cuz I know that if I wanted

8545.84 --> 8553.2
everybody to hear me guess what guess

8548.439 --> 8554.64
what that just means too bad cuz they

8553.2 --> 8558.08
are not going

8554.64 --> 8559.599999999999
to cuz you're not dumb enough so they're

8558.08 --> 8563.399
not going to get it and then they don't

8559.6 --> 8566.56
want to get it and so yeah too bad

8563.399 --> 8570.92
Arwin if I wanted everybody to just

8566.56 --> 8572.88
listen and hear me out I'd be extremely

8570.92 --> 8577.2
disappointed in

8572.88 --> 8580.199999999999
life so yeah no projection

8577.2 --> 8582.800000000001
there no it's definitely [ __ ] people

8580.2 --> 8584.6
that really think that the world needs

8582.8 --> 8587.599999999999
to hear

8584.6 --> 8589.960000000001
them when they're just spouting endless

8587.6 --> 8593.24
platitudes and things that are like yeah

8589.96 --> 8595.278999999999
we knew that 5 years ago [ __ ]

8593.24 --> 8597.319
[ __ ] yeah what's the point you think

8595.279 --> 8599.12
you're smart you think you're smart for

8597.319 --> 8601.0
repeating [ __ ] that's like heavily

8599.12 --> 8603.12
outdated and you're bringing it like

8601.0 --> 8605.76
it's this revolutionary new thing you

8603.12 --> 8609.08
discovered that everybody we know knew

8605.76 --> 8609.08
five years ago

8609.319 --> 8616.519999999999
yeah yeah that's not projection much cuz

8613.399 --> 8619.64
I actually do bring new things to the

8616.52 --> 8622.84
table I bring them to the table when the

8619.64 --> 8626.64
tip of the Spear of the correlating

8622.84 --> 8629.6
field hasn't even taken notice of it

8626.64 --> 8631.439
yeah so not projection in that sense I

8629.6 --> 8633.720000000001
bring subjects to the

8631.439 --> 8637.720000000001
table that are

8633.72 --> 8640.8
new that were new 5 years ago that were

8637.72 --> 8643.358999999999
new 10 years ago that were new 20 years

8640.8 --> 8645.759999999998
ago that were always new they have

8643.359 --> 8649.56
always been new it is new I brought a

8645.76 --> 8652.56
new thing to the table Yeah gas not

8649.56 --> 8654.319
having weight that's a new subject

8652.56 --> 8657.278999999999
that's not a subject that's been

8654.319 --> 8660.039999999999
endlessly treated out there no no it's a

8657.279 --> 8663.04
subject that's been endlessly

8660.04 --> 8664.720000000001
avoided and I brought it to the

8663.04 --> 8667.52
table

8664.72 --> 8672.479
yeah not endless

8667.52 --> 8672.479000000001
regurgitation and definitely not me

8672.84 --> 8678.359
projecting about dumb

8675.16 --> 8678.359
people right

8685.96 --> 8688.96
Gilla

that projection definitely doesn't fit

8739.479 --> 8744.16
in what I just explained that I am

8741.76 --> 8749.08
definitely not projecting when I said

8744.16 --> 8752.72
that despite Godzilla's timely comment

8749.08 --> 8752.72
there would you not

8755.359 --> 8759.399000000001
agree yeah I don't care about whether

8757.68 --> 8761.76

at when they check out Rumble just just

8844.399 --> 8848.88

that like why the [ __ ] does Rumble allow

8895.64 --> 8898.64
that

8899.479 --> 8905.399
unbelievable and it's like there every

8901.96 --> 8910.16

8928.0 --> 8935.8
provably worse than the front page of

8930.8 --> 8935.8
YouTube it just looks so

8938.319 --> 8942.319
terrible although it has been

8943.64 --> 8949.439
worse like try to look at it like in the

8946.479 --> 8952.8
evening then it's really

8949.439 --> 8954.399

have boobs there and it upsets me that

8981.84 --> 8988.04
that's the

8983.68 --> 8989.24
case I remember a time when supposed

8988.04 --> 8993.319000000001
right-wing

8989.24 --> 8996.72
people would like Sue other people over

8993.319 --> 9001.08
doing that kind of thing but now those

8996.72 --> 9002.479
right-wing people Pride Rumble being

9001.08 --> 9006.0
their home

9002.479 --> 9009.519999999999
tur when it has freaking boobs on a

9006.0 --> 9014.279
sports program in your face on the front

9009.52 --> 9018.439
page every single time you open it

9014.279 --> 9018.439

anything

9047.399 --> 9055.039999999999
and it's got Russell Brand which is like

9051.479 --> 9057.56
the worst Russell Brand is so [ __ ]

9055.04 --> 9062.359
[ __ ] like I'd

9057.56 --> 9065.278999999999
genuinely rather listen to Martin lekin

9062.359 --> 9070.0
nonstop because Martin Le is gonna make

9065.279 --> 9073.24
more sense than [ __ ] Russell

9070.0 --> 9076.04
Brand that guy is provably psychotic he

9073.24 --> 9078.84
says things that just don't make any

9076.04 --> 9082.319000000001
[ __ ] sense they never do and nobody

9078.84 --> 9082.319
ever calls him on

9083.08 --> 9090.64
it hey staple over at

9086.6 --> 9090.640000000001
Rumble always on the front

9090.88 --> 9097.519999999999
page yeah anyway I'll stop whining about

9094.0 --> 9097.52
Rumble but I'm a

9104.76 --> 9111.56
God oh by the way did I miss show

9107.88 --> 9111.56

[Music]

9156.6 --> 9160.640000000001
oo yeah that does actually

9165.24 --> 9170.64
fit

9167.64 --> 9172.84
yeah I put it in the title woohoo expand

9170.64 --> 9172.84
the

9178.8 --> 9184.96
title there's a few flat earthers that

9181.84 --> 9187.2
jumped on the Andrew tight vanwagon when

9184.96 --> 9190.599999999999
he talked about Flat Earth

9187.2 --> 9195.16
yeah I don't know

9190.6 --> 9197.04
why because the guy obviously doesn't

9195.16 --> 9200.8
care

9197.04 --> 9205.6
like those are people the Tates that

9200.8 --> 9208.84
literally don't care about [ __ ]

9205.6 --> 9211.6
anything anything they'll say anything

9208.84 --> 9214.52
to get your attention and then they'll

9211.6 --> 9218.359
just move on because they don't care

9214.52 --> 9220.319000000001
about anything they only get care they

9218.359 --> 9222.399000000001
get your attention they get your

9220.319 --> 9225.16
investment they don't care about

9222.399 --> 9227.599999999999
anything else in this [ __ ]

9225.16 --> 9228.56
world

9227.6 --> 9231.800000000001
that's

9228.56 --> 9234.6
it they're like walking advertisement

9231.8 --> 9238.0
Billboards and I can't believe people

9234.6 --> 9238.0
aren't just seeing

9243.0 --> 9249.2
it I mean it's freaking boring

9246.319 --> 9252.319
man have you ever s sat through one of

9249.2 --> 9256.319000000001
those sessions where they talk on camera

9252.319 --> 9259.8
like nothing is said you can like make

9256.319 --> 9261.8
transcript of an entire show and

9259.8 --> 9265.519999999999
conclude that

9261.8 --> 9270.56
absolutely nothing substantial has been

9265.52 --> 9272.800000000001
said that entire show not one damn thing

9270.56 --> 9272.8
of

9283.68 --> 9289.92
substance I mean

9287.16 --> 9294.16
he's so terrible he could literally be

9289.92 --> 9297.04
president of the United States in

9294.16 --> 9300.119999999999
Idiocracy I mean he kind of would

9297.04 --> 9303.800000000001
wouldn't he like Andrew Tate kind of is

9300.12 --> 9304.6
like the president of the United States

9303.8 --> 9307.679999999998
of

9304.6 --> 9310.76
Idiocracy he would be that he would

9307.68 --> 9313.08
actually function in a world of [ __ ]

9310.76 --> 9316.359
idiots they would think that he would

9313.08 --> 9317.56
make a good president wouldn't they you

9316.359 --> 9322.399000000001
know they

9317.56 --> 9325.24
would just take Andrew Tate put him in

9322.399 --> 9328.399
Idiocracy you know he would probably

9325.24 --> 9328.399
make a good president

9328.479 --> 9333.92
there if there's even such a thing he

9331.6 --> 9337.800000000001
would make

9333.92 --> 9340.439
more whatever the point is he belongs in

9337.8 --> 9344.039999999999
there he's an idiot

9340.439 --> 9346.479000000001
magnet he gathers re

9344.04 --> 9348.080000000002
retards another [ __ ] horse they all

9346.479 --> 9350.72
seem to do

9348.08 --> 9353.2
that it's the it's a new thing there's a

9350.72 --> 9355.24
lot of retards to scoop up these days on

9353.2 --> 9358.279
social media land a lot of retards that

9355.24 --> 9360.92
don't know what to do they don't have a

9358.279 --> 9363.04
future they can't really work on their

9360.92 --> 9365.88
future anymore so they're just finding

9363.04 --> 9368.0
things to follow and then dream how

9365.88 --> 9371.519999999999
following that will get them out of

9368.0 --> 9371.52
their hole and it never

9374.92 --> 9380.439
will and if you're following me because

9378.56 --> 9383.119999999999
you think that I'm going to get you out

9380.439 --> 9385.84
of a hole that you're in in your life

9383.12 --> 9388.160000000002
better think again cuz I actually don't

9385.84 --> 9388.16
do

9388.88 --> 9395.64
that now I could help you point out that

9393.24 --> 9397.56
you're in a hole and it could even get

9395.64 --> 9399.439
you some tips on how to get out of the

9397.56 --> 9403.0
hole but it's going to be you that's

9399.439 --> 9403.0
going to get out of that hole and not

9404.88 --> 9412.438999999998
me yeah I don't have a a quick Rich

9409.12 --> 9412.439
scheme for

9418.2 --> 9422.880000000001
you and I can promise you that if you

9420.84 --> 9425.6
keep following and supporting me that in

9422.88 --> 9429.64
10 years you'll all have a Bugatti I

9425.6 --> 9429.640000000001
definitely can promise you won't have

9434.8 --> 9437.8
that

9465.2 --> 9469.359
right so added know slow-mo it just

9467.52 --> 9471.479000000001
seems like a lot of supposed flat

9469.359 --> 9473.76
earthers like are they really flat

9471.479 --> 9477.0
earthers or are they just

9473.76 --> 9479.880000000001
people that use Flat Earth as part of

9477.0 --> 9481.6
their resume like oh yeah we we were

9479.88 --> 9484.72
with the Flat Earth but are they

9481.6 --> 9485.960000000001
behaving such or they just rolling into

9484.72 --> 9489.84
all the

9485.96 --> 9492.56
crap that Flat Earth was actually trying

9489.84 --> 9492.56
to point

9492.8 --> 9497.72
out how it's all [ __ ]

9498.96 --> 9504.08
yeah and not just oh space stuff oh that

9502.68 --> 9505.880000000001
well that doesn't mean it's a flatter oh

9504.08 --> 9508.76
well you got to destroy everything space

9505.88 --> 9511.599999999999
stuff it's all fake just never ever talk

9508.76 --> 9514.68
about that but everything else is fine

9511.6 --> 9517.720000000001
no no definitely not everything else is

9514.68 --> 9517.720000000001
fine in the

9520.0 --> 9526.08
contrary yeah the problem isn't that

9523.68 --> 9531.2
people believe in Space the problem is

9526.08 --> 9534.2
is that all people think it's okay to be

9531.2 --> 9537.880000000001
stupid that's the

9534.2 --> 9542.560000000001
universal human cultural

9537.88 --> 9542.56
problem it's been there all my

9543.6 --> 9550.720000000001
life it's not that people believe in the

9546.439 --> 9553.359
bow it's that people believe it's okay

9550.72 --> 9553.358999999999
to be

9554.64 --> 9557.64
stupid

9559.479 --> 9565.399
and that they tolerate

9562.0 --> 9570.399
stupidity from their

9565.399 --> 9570.399
peers that's the problem the problem is

9572.08 --> 9576.2
cultural and look what it's led

9584.64 --> 9587.64
to

9595.12 --> 9599.52
hey mystical Ro on fossils Flat Earth is

9597.12 --> 9602.2
doing good yeah I know it is doing good

9599.52 --> 9605.52
I mean flat earthers are not doing good

9602.2 --> 9606.84
but Flat Earth is doing good the era of

9605.52 --> 9611.6
the ball is

9606.84 --> 9611.6
over it's no longer the Hot

9611.84 --> 9617.960000000001
Topic yeah it's now just a belief yeah

9615.68 --> 9621.479000000001
the globe is now just a

9617.96 --> 9626.64
belief it's sinking

9621.479 --> 9626.64
in the shift has happened it can't

9626.92 --> 9633.479
unshift the only way to get it back to

9629.96 --> 9634.919999999998
unshift is by massive amount of death

9633.479 --> 9637.64
and

9634.92 --> 9639.72
torture until everything is forgotten

9637.64 --> 9643.0
until people

9639.72 --> 9647.039999999999
literally erase their own

9643.0 --> 9650.04
minds because nothing about real reality

9647.04 --> 9652.880000000001
is feasible anymore to

9650.04 --> 9657.080000000002
remember that's the like only full

9652.88 --> 9659.64
torturous reset will bring back the

9657.08 --> 9662.64
globe and it's not going to

9659.64 --> 9662.64
