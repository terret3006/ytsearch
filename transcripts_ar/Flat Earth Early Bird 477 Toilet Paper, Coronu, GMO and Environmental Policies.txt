pretty good actually

175.87 --> 180.57
prepared to yesterday which was better

177.67 --> 180.57
than day before

181.77 --> 190.39000000000001
no more reoccurrence no more yeah

186.55 --> 192.49
no more Payton thank God and it really

190.39 --> 198.13
does seem like it's it's kind of over

192.49 --> 202.78
what what that was everything gradually

198.13 --> 207.63
sinking in and yeah yesterday man again

202.78 --> 212.05
a lot of media activity out there and

207.63 --> 214.75
yeah it's like now yeah as we pretty

212.05 --> 219.37
much all probably expected the corona

214.75 --> 222.88
fear hype is getting worse and it was

219.37 --> 225.489
kind of weird because yesterday was it

222.88 --> 228.07
again oh yeah I was basically returning

225.489 --> 229.87
some beer bottles you know to a

228.07 --> 232.06
supermarket that has a machine that

229.87 --> 233.44
handles them pretty well it's for

232.06 --> 236.11
recycling

233.44 --> 239.25
yeah I usually don't go there except for

236.11 --> 242.65
basically that and toilet paper and

239.25 --> 245.739
garbage bags because the add the rest of

242.65 --> 248.86
the store is not organic or barely but

245.739 --> 251.59
yeah when I got there returned it I did

248.86 --> 254.31
notice like hmmm that's a toilet paper

251.59 --> 257.919
going it was all gone all of it

254.31 --> 261.669
after that I went on to the grocery

257.919 --> 264.94
store I actually buy my food all organic

261.669 --> 269.85999999999996
store and the toilet paper was all gone

264.94 --> 275.229
it's like what and so yeah even the

269.86 --> 276.0
Netherlands is being struck by this I

275.229 --> 278.25
don't know

276.0 --> 280.8
market fears

278.25 --> 283.35
this hype get your stuff quickly before

280.8 --> 285.27000000000004
it's all gone causing everybody to get

283.35 --> 288.41
it so that it's all gone basically self

285.27 --> 291.24
self fulfilling prophecy creation and

288.41 --> 298.11
well yeah it was kind of funny because I

291.24 --> 299.55
kind of I felt it coming last weekend it

298.11 --> 300.71000000000004
was already being hyped and I was like

299.55 --> 304.17
oh come on really

300.71 --> 306.33
okay okay well I needed to buy toilet

304.17 --> 310.53000000000003
paper anyway so I I'd uh i bought a

306.33 --> 312.59999999999997
double batch like the largest size that

310.53 --> 313.46999999999997
i could find because it was a what's all

312.6 --> 318.87
still there

313.47 --> 320.70000000000005
for sale back then so funny that i went

318.87 --> 323.96
to the store just when is it yesterday

320.7 --> 325.77
or two days ago and it was all gone so

323.96 --> 330.23999999999995
was there in time

325.77 --> 332.58
I got my toilet paper for plenty and it

330.24 --> 336.35
seems like my roommates I did push them

332.58 --> 341.31
like yeah don't wait with this like stop

336.35 --> 344.1
like please just get it because if you

341.31 --> 346.74
said no no wait until after yeah yep

344.1 --> 348.99
just get it now I didn't even want to

346.74 --> 350.97
hype them up like it'll be gone oh you

348.99 --> 353.64
just get it out and so they did

350.97 --> 356.22
eventually scramble and then I heard

353.64 --> 358.83
overheard them downstairs like we gotta

356.22 --> 363.03000000000003
do I found this is what's the last one

358.83 --> 365.37
and they shared yeah so they did figure

363.03 --> 368.4
out eventually that I was all gone and

365.37 --> 371.01
he still managed to get some but it was

368.4 --> 372.92999999999995
not even half of everything that I got

371.01 --> 380.01
so I'm keeping one here and then just

372.93 --> 382.46
see what happens so but yeah that was

380.01 --> 382.46
kind of weird

385.53 --> 395.13
TP ordered yeah it's kind of made me

391.47 --> 398.76000000000005
think - you know like where's the toilet

395.13 --> 401.58
paper actually produced I I don't know

398.76 --> 406.05
for sure like toilet paper should not be

401.58 --> 407.82
too hard to even make it's basically you

406.05 --> 411.36
have recycled paper and now if you did

407.82 --> 414.59999999999997
all the extra softy soft layer special

411.36 --> 419.55
fibre nonsense yeah okay you it's gonna

414.6 --> 421.91900000000004
be more resource product but yeah if you

419.55 --> 426.27000000000004
just need toilet paper then I think that

421.919 --> 429.96
pretty much any country that has paper

426.27 --> 432.65999999999997
available recycled research paper

429.96 --> 435.21
recyclates available to them could be

432.66 --> 438.69
spit or newspaper which is already

435.21 --> 442.34999999999997
usually is partially recycled at least

438.69 --> 447.96
here in the Netherlands I think how hard

442.35 --> 450.21000000000004
would it be to just I don't know build a

447.96 --> 453.33
toilet paper factory it wouldn't even

450.21 --> 454.979
necessarily need to be running all the

453.33 --> 457.74
time doesn't need to be in operation but

454.979 --> 460.5
it was just a system that so that toilet

457.74 --> 464.31
paper could quickly be made without too

460.5 --> 466.41
much costs like emergency local

464.31 --> 470.729
production and that made me think yeah

466.41 --> 473.22
like that could be interesting but yeah

470.729 --> 475.2
I'm over I'm thinking all of this

473.22 --> 477.33000000000004
already wait to series anyway because it

475.2 --> 479.37
is just a ridiculous hype it is really

477.33 --> 482.19
because of the hype that it's so loud I

479.37 --> 487.02
think unless they're gonna do something

482.19 --> 489.15
crazy and literally cut off cut off all

487.02 --> 491.90999999999997
the these supplies and not restock them

489.15 --> 493.65
now that would that would absolutely

491.91 --> 496.71000000000004
cause unrest but yeah

493.65 --> 499.73999999999995
stores effectively closing down because

496.71 --> 505.10999999999996
there's no more products coming in does

499.74 --> 508.02
that by itself so I don't know yet

505.11 --> 511.56
what's going on I should ask really like

508.02 --> 513.0889999999999
hey what are your managers telling you

511.56 --> 515.409
is it gonna be restocked

513.089 --> 517.5390000000001
or is there a long-term problem I have

515.409 --> 519.399
even really asked yet probably I

517.539 --> 522.9399999999999
probably will today when I go to the

519.399 --> 528.99
store just just to get a little more

522.94 --> 528.99
informed from star owners perspectives

529.589 --> 542.5290000000001
no Missouri bear no no nobody in Europe

533.74 --> 544.089
you SSB debts except the French and it's

542.529 --> 548.949
kind of funny though because we that's

544.089 --> 555.149
our kind of effective it's just yeah

548.949 --> 555.149
I personally don't prefer that at all

557.009 --> 565.689
and I'm not like a is it

562.99 --> 568.42
I'm not a toilet paper what wastes user

565.689 --> 572.079
in the sense that I like use fast

568.42 --> 573.79
quantities of that I've seen people I

572.079 --> 577.269
don't know what that bus I didn't know

573.79 --> 579.279
if it is a cultural thing but I've seen

577.269 --> 582.399
like people from the Mediterranean area

579.279 --> 584.41
Spain Greece I don't know about Italy

582.399 --> 587.74
but they could be typically like that to

584.41 --> 589.7199999999999
that just use fast insane amounts of

587.74 --> 593.5600000000001
toilet paper every go it's just a

589.72 --> 596.2900000000001
complete waste they would basically take

593.56 --> 601.18
a single roll and go through it in two

596.29 --> 604.449
days that's gonna cost a lot of toilet

601.18 --> 607.779
labor but I don't do that so yeah I can

604.449 --> 613.12
do plenty of time and and be very

607.779 --> 616.569
hygienic and all that so but I don't

613.12 --> 618.49
know in France I guess some people still

616.569 --> 622.54
use toilet paper over it's not like ooh

618.49 --> 625.589
toilet paper is forbidden but they have

622.54 --> 625.5889999999999
been at there

628.61 --> 638.74
they do have him anyway hmm yeah how did

636.86 --> 641.33
it come to this how did it come to

638.74 --> 645.23
flatters earlybird number four hundred

641.33 --> 647.269
seventy seventy seventy seven let's talk

645.23 --> 649.49
about toilet paper yeah I think I'm

647.269 --> 653.45
actually gonna freakin call the hang out

649.49 --> 655.13
that just because it's so damn silly yet

653.45 --> 658.1690000000001
true

655.13 --> 658.169
[Music]

660.62 --> 663.71
[Music]

673.98 --> 685.51
there you give right George sent for

683.05 --> 688.63
mind control is strong well just look at

685.51 --> 692.01
what is basically causing this what is

688.63 --> 696.07
causing these run outs and all this

692.01 --> 699.84
tension it is basically the the

696.07 --> 705.9100000000001
monolithic way society has been formed

699.84 --> 708.24
mass trade international trade and huge

705.91 --> 710.5899999999999
production companies that

708.24 --> 714.37
internationally send out their products

710.59 --> 718.36
right and that is really what what is

714.37 --> 720.28
the cause of this because yeah if then

718.36 --> 723.61
the borders closed down suddenly you're

720.28 --> 726.67
not gonna have these huge production

723.61 --> 729.07
companies producing for you anymore as

726.67 --> 731.7099999999999
is some kind of country somewhere so

729.07 --> 734.44
what do you do then yeah then you are

731.71 --> 736.3000000000001
either out and you get all panicky or

734.44 --> 739.6
you start to somehow produce it yourself

736.3 --> 741.88
or get it from somewhere else and that's

739.6 --> 748.02
yeah it's one of the long-term problems

741.88 --> 751.66
with globalism one could argue that even

748.02 --> 753.5799999999999
basic products daily Pro usable product

751.66 --> 756.1
the daily use products who could

753.58 --> 759.46
suddenly just run out and hey if you

756.1 --> 761.02
know a bit about history yeah and

759.46 --> 762.6700000000001
whatever how much you trust that it's

761.02 --> 766.65
another matter but it just look in the

762.67 --> 769.99
history of the Soviet Union that [ __ ]

766.65 --> 772.48
listen went down there constantly that

769.99 --> 774.82
happened a lot like you couldn't get

772.48 --> 781.02
freaking basic products because it was

774.82 --> 785.2900000000001
just out and it wasn't gonna be helped

781.02 --> 787.39
because of political party decisions yet

785.29 --> 790.5999999999999
they had plenty supplies of everything

787.39 --> 793.78
they didn't give a [ __ ] really she

790.6 --> 797.44
couldn't talk about it so it's it is

793.78 --> 800.5
kind of a typical communist side effect

797.44 --> 802.84
and it is also there potentially with

800.5 --> 803.93
globalism although it's not exactly like

802.84 --> 807.69
that

803.93 --> 810.2099999999999
and yeah it's I think it's even what it

807.69 --> 814.22
even was referenced in the book 90-84 as

810.21 --> 817.6800000000001
well was like a dress like grazier ation

814.22 --> 822.3000000000001
rations and all that because that is

817.68 --> 827.01
typical typically that happens with a

822.3 --> 830.0899999999999
giant centralized system with mass

827.01 --> 833.85
producers international that are all

830.09 --> 837.0500000000001
basically dependent on this on mass

833.85 --> 840.71
trade international trade to be an

837.05 --> 843.66
option because as soon as that's gone

840.71 --> 847.2
it's just yeah nothing's available

843.66 --> 848.9399999999999
anymore so it is really a wider long

847.2 --> 852.62
term problem that is now being

848.94 --> 852.62
highlighted through this scenario

860.62 --> 863.789
[Music]

865.79 --> 868.39
what

870.36 --> 874.14
Nathan what

874.55 --> 877.7199999999999
[Music]

884.68 --> 887.55
all right

891.01 --> 898.6899999999999
and one thing I've also noticed I think

896.829 --> 901.9899999999999
connection problems all this morning I

898.69 --> 910.5100000000001
hope it's not gonna break down on me

901.99 --> 914.41
again right but yeah you know there's no

910.51 --> 918.699
way to get around in media world now on

914.41 --> 923.11
YouTube without every single place you

918.699 --> 928.329
go every single frickin place every one

923.11 --> 931.149
of them there's always one word or some

928.329 --> 934.0
thought or something whatever about the

931.149 --> 936.31
freakin coronavirus it's really annoying

934.0 --> 939.339
that you can't get away from people

936.31 --> 940.959
talking about it anymore probably if I

939.339 --> 943.36
decide like you screw that I'm going

940.959 --> 945.13
away from YouTube yeah well guess what

943.36 --> 948.4590000000001
out there guess what people are talking

945.13 --> 951.6
about every freaking where it's you

948.459 --> 951.5999999999999
can't get away from it

953.17 --> 960.639
and even about also how ridiculous it is

958.11 --> 963.639
because I do think a lot of people that

960.639 --> 965.74
I just just by the way they compose

963.639 --> 970.23
themselves and have a cold they're like

965.74 --> 974.23
yeah duh of course it's nonsense

970.23 --> 976.69
we're not that stupid you know they

974.23 --> 979.63
might not want to think about 911 they

976.69 --> 983.0500000000001
definitely probably not want to think

979.63 --> 986.13
about flat earth but even they know that

983.05 --> 989.38
this is just [ __ ] a lot of them

986.13 --> 991.93
because I haven't seen anybody really

989.38 --> 993.99
get panicky over it except just a couple

991.93 --> 997.569
of people that would typically take

993.99 --> 1001.589
whatever subject to get all riled up

997.569 --> 1004.01
about and I mean out there not on the

1001.589 --> 1004.0100000000001
Internet

1006.139 --> 1012.989
and yeah lift fellas is is so bad now I

1011.309 --> 1016.289
really have to say it Nathan

1012.989 --> 1019.6790000000001

1016.289 --> 1023.8489999999999
of interesting views interesting guests

good taste in music and art I think to a

1023.849 --> 1030.75
certain level but my god dude you're

1026.85 --> 1033.4699999999998
like now yeah I don't have to realize

1030.75 --> 1038.879
but you are a fair porn peddler now

1033.47 --> 1049.939
talking literally about the corona

1038.879 --> 1049.9389999999999
apocalypse just what have you become an

1052.85 --> 1057.9599999999998
yeah not you Nathan Oakley don't worry

1055.62 --> 1060.629
now you've been very persistently

1057.96 --> 1063.75
against it even more than myself and I

1060.629 --> 1065.9399999999998
can actually respect that now I'm

1063.75 --> 1072.679
talking about Nathan Stockman from lift

1065.94 --> 1075.5700000000002
the veil a kind of an American city guy

1072.679 --> 1079.259
bit of a leftist who's kind of also

1075.57 --> 1081.84
media savvy and gets around keeps a

1079.259 --> 1084.35
close eye on politics upon cultural

1081.84 --> 1087.899
developments international situated that

1084.35 --> 1090.269
he's uh he's kind of okay but man he's

1087.899 --> 1092.369
just spiraling out of control in this

1090.269 --> 1095.07
corona apocalypse and he's like with

1092.369 --> 1102.4089999999999
these big eyes like oh I'm so gonna die

1095.07 --> 1106.6789999999999
like dude what happened to you man like

1102.409 --> 1110.0700000000002
serious is it that bad or maybe he's

1106.679 --> 1112.5
just freaking nervous out of his mind

1110.07 --> 1114.539
because of just the city location he

1112.5 --> 1116.7
lives that and the people going nuts

1114.539 --> 1119.279
around him because yeah people going

1116.7 --> 1121.799
nuts around you that would kind of a

1119.279 --> 1124.169
nerve me as well and at that I'm kind of

1121.799 --> 1127.619
lucky that as I shared right before this

1124.169 --> 1129.96
that out here people are talking about

1127.619 --> 1132.48
it but it's barely anyone that's really

1129.96 --> 1135.24

1132.48 --> 1138.1
annoyed like

I hope the sound got through all right

1292.12 --> 1297.61
not sure huh

1294.91 --> 1300.03
I had to lighten it up a little to get

1297.61 --> 1300.03
it through

1321.04 --> 1333.6399999999999
Oh HM I'm pretty sure that was a Chinese

1327.19 --> 1335.23
American alright great to hear yeah

1333.64 --> 1337.18
Missouri berry I'm pretty sure you

1335.23 --> 1339.25
probably saw it on over at Bowen

1337.18 --> 1341.44
Benjamin's it's just I thought it was a

1339.25 --> 1343.99
good typical video you know I'd almost

1341.44 --> 1346.8700000000001
be inclined to play the other one but

1343.99 --> 1349.78
the corona virus that guy with the

1346.87 --> 1351.4899999999998
corona stick I love that one but that's

1349.78 --> 1353.44
really that guy's personal creative

1351.49 --> 1356.56
video and Owen Benjamin already shared

1353.44 --> 1363.31
it and its pretty long even but it was

1356.56 --> 1367.6
hilarious yeah and Owen Benjamin was

1363.31 --> 1372.78
great yesterday what two streams again I

1367.6 --> 1376.99
think oh yeah

1372.78 --> 1378.58
but was it the second one I had a lot of

1376.99 --> 1382.06
trouble with the connection that was so

1378.58 --> 1384.8799999999999
annoying but he didn't restream it and

1382.06 --> 1387.12
then it was a slightly less interrupted

1384.88 --> 1387.1200000000001
so

1391.32 --> 1395.009
what else did I watch

1404.89 --> 1411.4
what

1407.26 --> 1416.11
oh [ __ ] what is that

1411.4 --> 1418.75
Oh God Down syndrome president from

1416.11 --> 1420.78
month and bear damn I haven't seen that

1418.75 --> 1423.91
one yet

1420.78 --> 1425.8899999999999
man I gotta watch that one but I'm gonna

1423.91 --> 1431.5
have to wait until the show is over that

1425.89 --> 1432.9
looks just freakin hilarious that looks

1431.5 --> 1437.01
amazing

1432.9 --> 1437.01
can't wait to dig into that

1451.789 --> 1458.899
let's see what else oh yeah a flatter

1455.309 --> 1458.899
discord I was on there little

1467.27 --> 1472.22
I don't know why sometimes I have so

1470.54 --> 1475.04
much trouble remembering what I've been

1472.22 --> 1477.95
doing even though I'm pretty sure that I

1475.04 --> 1481.57
did things like all the time it's just

1477.95 --> 1481.57
like what was I doing

1488.2 --> 1498.2
think of it well I think that just

1495.05 --> 1500.1789999999999
watching Owen Benjamin twice in an

1498.2 --> 1505.49
evening probably spit it costs a lot of

1500.179 --> 1508.22
time making dinner and all that watching

1505.49 --> 1511.49
a bit of Alex Jones Show here and there

1508.22 --> 1515.78
not too long though oh yeah also in

1511.49 --> 1518.99
recent times I kind of you know when the

1515.78 --> 1522.3799999999999
Flat Earth debates ends sometimes like

1518.99 --> 1524.9
the after-show ends sometimes it's it

1522.38 --> 1529.73
like at five o'clock five Amsterdam time

1524.9 --> 1531.92
right and yeah in the recent week or so

1529.73 --> 1534.32
sometimes now tuned into the David

1531.92 --> 1537.53
Knight show I kind of forget forget

1534.32 --> 1539.09
about that because it happens before the

1537.53 --> 1543.44
Alex Jones Show and it's a completely

1539.09 --> 1546.23
different feel and yeah thought it's

1543.44 --> 1549.29
actually kind of good it is still yeah

1546.23 --> 1551.99
Alex Jones based narrative in a in a

1549.29 --> 1554.1789999999999
larger wave but the guy has his own

1551.99 --> 1557.6
style and he's been going at it for a

1554.179 --> 1560.9
long time like I even remember when Alex

1557.6 --> 1564.9199999999998
started up the the three show Thrones

1560.9 --> 1569.74
model for going from beyond just himself

1564.92 --> 1573.2
having four hours show non-stop into

1569.74 --> 1575.1200000000001
having that David Knight show the Alex

1573.2 --> 1579.2
Jones Show and then the war room within

1575.12 --> 1583.76
Troy and yeah so they've been going for

1579.2 --> 1587.3600000000001
like years now and so yeah I don't know

1583.76 --> 1589.16
it's it's it's a taste thing but

1587.36 --> 1593.8999999999999
recently I've watched him and it just

1589.16 --> 1596.99
noticed like yeah how I always seemed to

1593.9 --> 1598.8200000000002
be improving and well Who am I to say

1596.99 --> 1600.65
you know but it's just like yeah I

1598.82 --> 1602.3
haven't watched him at the time and then

1600.65 --> 1604.5500000000002
comparing it to what I remember it

1602.3 --> 1610.7
looked kind of good actually really calm

1604.55 --> 1612.74
and reserved and not panicking over even

1610.7 --> 1614.21
the things that he was sharing as it

1612.74 --> 1628.88
were it's just I don't know I kind of

1614.21 --> 1633.46
liked it Tom Hanks what I like to enjoy

1628.88 --> 1636.5300000000002
doing CNN he is ran by Time Warner okay

1633.46 --> 1642.92
all right sure

1636.53 --> 1644.75
oh I I bet he does one you know while he

1642.92 --> 1648.17
I think he always wanted to become like

1644.75 --> 1651.32
the new media the new right-wing media

1648.17 --> 1661.3100000000002
but based on his view on how he wants to

1651.32 --> 1662.8999999999999
see things his own time warner books i

1661.31 --> 1665.59
don't know what that means exactly but

1662.9 --> 1665.5900000000001
okay

1679.97 --> 1695.69
on the payroll okay all right oh yeah

1683.72 --> 1697.789
you tell me what that means that's not

1695.69 --> 1701.3300000000002
true mother Salemi definitely touched

1697.789 --> 1706.759
upon that absolutely he just doesn't

1701.33 --> 1710.149
like to because it's kind of obvious

1706.759 --> 1712.159
that he's in with that crowd like one

1710.149 --> 1716.09
way or the other whether he literally is

1712.159 --> 1719.24
a part of that I don't know but he is

1716.09 --> 1723.9499999999998
like with them I think he's doing

1719.24 --> 1725.69
business with them some way so every

1723.95 --> 1727.8500000000001
time that kind of thing is brought up he

1725.69 --> 1730.309
always tries to spin around it as much

1727.85 --> 1732.23
as possible while still kind of being

1730.309 --> 1736.49
upfront like that it just doesn't want

1732.23 --> 1741.95
to talk about it but he has so he is

1736.49 --> 1747.7
just not no more news constantly juju

1741.95 --> 1750.799
juju juju design you did not that so

1747.7 --> 1757.1290000000001
here here you go again all of you are

1750.799 --> 1760.059
you doing it again it's really a gem

1757.129 --> 1763.059
you're gonna go caps on me with this

1760.059 --> 1763.059
really

1775.61 --> 1784.49
that it's I'm just so annoyed by people

1780.58 --> 1788.72
that know me come here every day and

1784.49 --> 1793.64
they still let themselves fall into that

1788.72 --> 1796.25
mega black-and-white polarized view it's

1793.64 --> 1799.0700000000002
kind of dumb at this point I've been

1796.25 --> 1804.83
trying to educate you all and warn you

1799.07 --> 1809.72
about that thing that happens you need

1804.83 --> 1812.32
to look a little further people it's

1809.72 --> 1812.32
getting annoying

1825.12 --> 1832.7399999999998
[Music]

1827.85 --> 1834.8
it's and that's it all right so that's

1832.74 --> 1838.14
it that is it

1834.8 --> 1841.56
alex is just another page he'll don't

1838.14 --> 1844.68
ever listen to him ever because he is

1841.56 --> 1847.74
just a page he'll or let's not get into

1844.68 --> 1850.71
what that actually means how that works

1847.74 --> 1853.83
in the grand scheme of things no let's

1850.71 --> 1856.14
just say that and then never talk about

1853.83 --> 1860.22
him again and let's cut off that entire

1856.14 --> 1861.5700000000002
part for media consciousness that has an

1860.22 --> 1864.15
influence on the world out there let's

1861.57 --> 1866.99
cut it out completely surgically remove

1864.15 --> 1873.96
it because he is a paid chill right

1866.99 --> 1878.1
right Sivan yay right black why I can't

1873.96 --> 1882.83
do it I can't just not choose between

1878.1 --> 1882.83
black and white oh oh

1885.62 --> 1889.6
[Music]

1892.84 --> 1914.1999999999998
oh misery Revell

1912.34 --> 1917.4599999999998
yeah well that one I can appreciate it

1914.2 --> 1918.6100000000001
because yeah when it comes to Alex as a

1917.46 --> 1921.039
person

1918.61 --> 1927.549
oh yeah there's plenty wrong with him

1921.039 --> 1931.289
and yeah that's that's kind of obvious

1927.549 --> 1935.49
the guy's issues and he talks about it

1931.289 --> 1935.49
even pretty openly

1944.509 --> 1950.489
yeah I think it's hilarious I think that

1947.519 --> 1953.309
our one Benjamin making fun of him for

1950.489 --> 1957.739
the things that he doesn't is I think

1953.309 --> 1964.859
it's it's great and I love that [ __ ]

1957.739 --> 1966.809
okay hm piss off you did it again a gem

1964.859 --> 1970.109
you couldn't help yourself could you

1966.809 --> 1973.32
you couldn't help yourself it's time to

1970.109 --> 1975.529
[ __ ] off again don't come back for a

1973.32 --> 1980.57
while because you did it again

1975.529 --> 1980.57
you can't help yourself no discipline

1993.29 --> 1996.349
[Music]

1997.35 --> 2004.1
yeah I know good servant I know you get

1999.96 --> 2008.539
it because you have some actual

2004.1 --> 2011.6899999999998
discipline and yeah Alex like really

2008.539 --> 2014.919
repulses me sometimes because he is such

2011.69 --> 2018.799
a double downer on on his agency and

2014.919 --> 2021.0490000000002
unfair prone tactics and he it's weird

2018.799 --> 2024.08
because as time has progressed I've been

2021.049 --> 2026.929
watching him for like 15 years and at

2024.08 --> 2030.019
first I didn't even notice the fear part

2026.929 --> 2033.019
I thought like no the fear point is the

2030.019 --> 2036.169
only sensible response in a time when

2033.019 --> 2039.98
the entire world and media was just

2036.169 --> 2041.72
literally so everything is alright

2039.98 --> 2043.429
nothing's like I don't know it's nothing

2041.72 --> 2046.69
as bad no but it's all according to plan

2043.429 --> 2049.94
when everything was going very wrong and

2046.69 --> 2051.829
then that made sense it he was like we

2049.94 --> 2053.7200000000003
have to sound the alarm right now

2051.829 --> 2054.849
because everybody's been put into a

2053.72 --> 2057.47
trance

2054.849 --> 2060.53
where suddenly the Satanists will be

2057.47 --> 2066.2599999999998
able to take out and yeah that was kind

2060.53 --> 2072.3790000000004
of right he was it was right but things

2066.26 --> 2078.5890000000004
have changed a lot since then a lot the

2072.379 --> 2082.2799999999997
alternative media mindset the type of

2078.589 --> 2085.31
individual is a thing now and there's a

2082.28 --> 2087.6490000000003
lot of development and just media is no

2085.31 --> 2093.139
longer centralized like it was it just

2087.649 --> 2096.31
isn't and the centralized control is

2093.139 --> 2098.81
trying to get some control back by

2096.31 --> 2101.089
basically bribing and trying to control

2098.81 --> 2103.4
alternative media individuals that get

2101.089 --> 2105.47
successful that's their new kind of

2103.4 --> 2111.38
tactic to kind of keep that under

2105.47 --> 2114.589
control but in general it seems like the

2111.38 --> 2117.77
greatest danger of just the whole world

2114.589 --> 2120.74
going to sleep and then something

2117.77 --> 2124.28
horrific happening like that that seems

2120.74 --> 2126.5299999999997
to kind of be over we kind of broke that

2124.28 --> 2129.5600000000004
all of us together and Alex was a big

2126.53 --> 2131.0600000000004
part of that too but he's not letting go

2129.56 --> 2134.12
of the sword he's not

2131.06 --> 2136.67
go of his weapon that he used it's like

2134.12 --> 2140.21
no his works too good I gotta keep using

2136.67 --> 2141.89
it so he's not still continuing fear

2140.21 --> 2147.64
porn tactics and therefore he is

2141.89 --> 2147.64
basically creating his own agency now

2147.88 --> 2153.4900000000002
his own kind of yeah well marketing

2151.85 --> 2156.5299999999997
schemes I can't say it any other way

2153.49 --> 2158.5699999999997
doesn't all have to be purely benevolent

2156.53 --> 2160.3700000000003
to kill people that kind of Juji annex

2158.57 --> 2164.27
nonsense but it is kind of marketing

2160.37 --> 2166.91
scheme aimed in a way like this fear up

2164.27 --> 2168.35
then give like the product that could

2166.91 --> 2171.7599999999998
typically help for that you know that

2168.35 --> 2174.68
could if it was real whatever all that

2171.76 --> 2177.86
because yeah say about what you like

2174.68 --> 2179.96
products still work they do they do work

2177.86 --> 2181.82
they may be now a little bit more

2179.96 --> 2184.52
expensive than what else is out there

2181.82 --> 2186.1400000000003
supposedly they still work and back then

2184.52 --> 2188.06
they also worked and they were really

2186.14 --> 2191.15
cheap back then it it's just that the

2188.06 --> 2192.07
market itself has changed so see just

2191.15 --> 2195.65
keeping it real

2192.07 --> 2198.02
stop the freakin polarizing the

2195.65 --> 2200.7200000000003
black-and-white see see what I just

2198.02 --> 2203.99
explained all the extra insights as to

2200.72 --> 2206.6299999999997
what's going on when you do go beyond Oh

2203.99 --> 2210.56
Alex to pay chill that's surgically

2206.63 --> 2212.9900000000002
remove him and everything is about ever

2210.56 --> 2217.07
and history all of that from our minds

2212.99 --> 2219.1299999999997
and just ignore it from now on see what

2217.07 --> 2222.38
you can actually figure out and

2219.13 --> 2225.59
understand and learn when you don't do

2222.38 --> 2227.4500000000003
that see why it pisses me so much off

2225.59 --> 2230.08
when people do that now do you

2227.45 --> 2230.08
understand now

2239.8 --> 2246.54
what really led that's ridiculous

2255.91 --> 2267.75
yeah but don't check it on call people

2259.81 --> 2267.75
liars it's not good

2281.25 --> 2287.42
so moving on to another person to attack

2290.33 --> 2298.2
why do you always have to focus on

2293.49 --> 2300.89
somebody to attack I don't get this and

2298.2 --> 2307.0499999999997
Riley has this problem too you know

2300.89 --> 2309.96
you yeah I don't want to like go into

2307.05 --> 2312.63
friendly-fire scenarios here but yeah

2309.96 --> 2315.57
Riley is sometimes kind of a little bit

2312.63 --> 2320.7000000000003
a bit of a bully but he's very careful

2315.57 --> 2321.7200000000003
and he always only just points out the

2320.7 --> 2324.0899999999997
technicals

2321.72 --> 2328.109
really and then just makes a joke out of

2324.09 --> 2330.42
it but he's always basically yeah making

2328.109 --> 2334.08
videos about other people about ballers

2330.42 --> 2337.71
and the crazy things that they say so

2334.08 --> 2340.7999999999997
yeah is it really bullying no not really

2337.71 --> 2343.77
although yeah it does kind of get a bit

2340.8 --> 2346.05
on the edge because I don't know it's

2343.77 --> 2349.38
just his lawyer mine kind of demands

2346.05 --> 2352.5600000000004
that of him I think like yes that issue

2349.38 --> 2354.06
with me too you know that sometimes he

2352.56 --> 2356.849
just thinks haha this is funny

2354.06 --> 2359.19
I'm gonna make little little practical

2356.849 --> 2360.4500000000003
joke with Arwen and then it turns out

2359.19 --> 2366.7200000000003
that I actually don't think it's that

2360.45 --> 2374.04
funny at all so that's just who that

2366.72 --> 2376.859
yeah that's just Riley exactly no need

2374.04 --> 2380.64
to report it's ridiculous and just

2376.859 --> 2383.19
nobody should do that anyhow you know

2380.64 --> 2388.6189999999997
unless it's just blatantly obvious that

2383.19 --> 2391.23
a person is just a pure slanderer just

2388.619 --> 2394.56
slandering only spreading really

2391.23 --> 2396.839
disgusting negativity or calling for

2394.56 --> 2400.58
violence or that kind of [ __ ] yeah

2396.839 --> 2400.58
that's what the reporting is for

2402.1 --> 2412.96
oh yeah one could go as far as like yeah

2409.42 --> 2417.52
daxing and all that bad daxing open with

2412.96 --> 2419.32
video and all that kind of thing but

2417.52 --> 2421.36
yeah just people making videos on

2419.32 --> 2424.3300000000004
YouTube this is ridiculous why would you

2421.36 --> 2427.0
do that they're literally just

2424.33 --> 2428.89
addressing a subject something a person

2427.0 --> 2433.03
has said you know that so many people do

2428.89 --> 2436.48
that like maybe a quarter of every

2433.03 --> 2440.7900000000004
YouTube video on YouTube is like

2436.48 --> 2445.98
response videos to somebody else and

2440.79 --> 2445.98
yeah I'll betcha it's not all positive

2454.14 --> 2459.97
right I decided to concertino yeah I

2457.36 --> 2463.21
totally get you because I kind of M like

2459.97 --> 2467.1699999999996
that as well the thing is though I

2463.21 --> 2467.98
simply cannot stock up like that not

2467.17 --> 2474.52
exactly

2467.98 --> 2478.87
I can stock up for pretty long but I I I

2474.52 --> 2481.93
just don't think that it's gonna get to

2478.87 --> 2484.33
a the store is a hundred percent empty

2481.93 --> 2487.89
scenario I don't think that is gonna

2484.33 --> 2490.99
happen like they couldn't like so many

2487.89 --> 2494.71
vegetables in stores everywhere in the

2490.99 --> 2497.4399999999996
world are already local because it's

2494.71 --> 2499.12
just fresher it's better so that produce

2497.44 --> 2500.92
and all that it's still gonna be there

2499.12 --> 2502.45
it's never gonna be a hundred percent

2500.92 --> 2507.48
empty that makes no sense

2502.45 --> 2510.37
yeah products made in other countries

2507.48 --> 2512.23
those may be cut off potentially I don't

2510.37 --> 2516.31
know even though if they're that's a

2512.23 --> 2519.13
long-term thing or not but yeah basic

2516.31 --> 2524.16
foods and fresh vegetables I can't see

2519.13 --> 2524.1600000000003
that just completely going away

2524.55 --> 2530.2200000000003
GMO fresh vegetables for you oh hey

2527.08 --> 2530.22
that's yeah

2533.47 --> 2543.0699999999997
they're not over here you know the the

2539.83 --> 2546.7599999999998
GMO issue in the United States is yeah

2543.07 --> 2550.96
it is such a bad scenario that I don't

2546.76 --> 2554.05
understand why why there's literally no

2550.96 --> 2556.27
gangs of people just going through these

2554.05 --> 2558.9700000000003
farmers and telling them dude you're not

2556.27 --> 2561.52
gonna [ __ ] plant GMO here you're not

2558.97 --> 2563.47
gonna do it are we gonna get you I don't

2561.52 --> 2565.9
understand why that's not happening

2563.47 --> 2569.1099999999997
although one could argue it's probably

2565.9 --> 2573.07
the other way around is probably farmers

2569.11 --> 2575.32
getting blackmailed by thugs hired by

2573.07 --> 2577.0
GMO people tell you no you are gonna do

2575.32 --> 2578.7400000000002
that or we're gonna get you maybe that

2577.0 --> 2583.03
is what's good I don't know man I don't

2578.74 --> 2588.3999999999996
know I don't know but I don't understand

2583.03 --> 2590.23
why it's just continuing you know people

2588.4 --> 2592.9300000000003
complain about government this

2590.23 --> 2595.93
government that about even even

2592.93 --> 2600.69
complaining fluoride in the water seems

2595.93 --> 2604.12
kind of trivial in relation to yeah

2600.69 --> 2608.53
literally the producers of food itself

2604.12 --> 2612.4
all producing very dangerous poisonous

2608.53 --> 2614.02
crap instead I cannot believe that it's

2612.4 --> 2614.7400000000002
just happening like that I cannot

2614.02 --> 2619.92
believe it

2614.74 --> 2625.9599999999996
I cannot believe that that's just

2619.92 --> 2629.08
happening there and I'm exhilarated that

2625.96 --> 2633.43
it's that is gone here i I went on the

2629.08 --> 2637.81
protest marches against GMO because just

2633.43 --> 2642.25
know like I don't know man I don't want

2637.81 --> 2646.21
to say something stupid here but I'm

2642.25 --> 2652.78
willing to go very far to make sure that

2646.21 --> 2657.4
it's just dead that it stops GMO has to

2652.78 --> 2658.1800000000003
stop no more GMO has to stop everywhere

2657.4 --> 2661.92
forever

2658.18 --> 2666.93
nobody it should be forbidden worldwide

2661.92 --> 2666.9300000000003
nobody should be allowed to do that ever

2668.15 --> 2675.3
[Music]

2670.94 --> 2677.9700000000003
ever it's as simple as that you know for

2675.3 --> 2681.9900000000002
no reason no reason medical what it

2677.97 --> 2688.08
doesn't matter no GMO ever under any

2681.99 --> 2691.31
circumstances and hey if you wanna just

2688.08 --> 2694.5299999999997
regular crossbreed stuff natural

2691.31 --> 2696.99
crossbreeding and all that yeah go for

2694.53 --> 2699.09
it it's incredible things that are

2696.99 --> 2701.04
possible with just that technique and

2699.09 --> 2702.9900000000002
it's been used for a very long time in a

2701.04 --> 2704.49
all these things are still there you

2702.99 --> 2708.12
know for hundreds of years they didn't

2704.49 --> 2713.9399999999996
die out because that is okay you can do

2708.12 --> 2717.15
that GMO gene guns damaging rearranging

2713.94 --> 2722.76
of the natural blueprint no it should be

2717.15 --> 2723.69
forbidden completely forever it's as

2722.76 --> 2727.11
simple as that

2723.69 --> 2729.66
I'm very glad that it is forbidden in

2727.11 --> 2734.28
the in Europe and I'm still disappointed

2729.66 --> 2736.68
that they still even allow it to be

2734.28 --> 2739.0800000000004
partially there under certain blah blah

2736.68 --> 2740.7
blah blah average statistical nonsense

2739.08 --> 2747.66
no it should be a hundred percent

2740.7 --> 2749.79
forbidden forever and yeah I could go a

2747.66 --> 2753.93
little farther and just say like yeah

2749.79 --> 2758.52
GMO people people that actually want

2753.93 --> 2761.6
that into the world that yeah it should

2758.52 --> 2761.6
not end well for them

2767.72 --> 2773.089
whatever deluded vision they had

2770.03 --> 2776.15
whatever stupid little movie told them

2773.089 --> 2777.5789999999997
the GMO would be the only way to survive

2776.15 --> 2781.599
the apocalypse of

2777.579 --> 2786.23
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah well [ __ ] them

2781.599 --> 2788.9300000000003
[ __ ] them the GMO is the apocalypse it

2786.23 --> 2794.14
is the food apocalypse and it always was

2788.93 --> 2797.5099999999998
and the more you do the worse it gets

2794.14 --> 2800.6189999999997
GMO should be absolutely a hundred

2797.51 --> 2821.15
percent forbidden forever

2800.619 --> 2830.4500000000003
let's get this done right in my personal

2821.15 --> 2836.2000000000003
opinion shipping GMO food is very much

2830.45 --> 2841.3689999999997
very much on the same level as shipping

2836.2 --> 2844.7
diseased blankets yeah that's what that

2841.369 --> 2846.589
is oh you you want to help them with

2844.7 --> 2848.569
food you oh you want to help them with

2846.589 --> 2851.5099999999998
blankets well guess what's gonna happen

2848.569 --> 2851.869
when they use it yeah yeah that's what

2851.51 --> 2857.42
it is

2851.869 --> 2861.59
it's bio warfare it always was should be

2857.42 --> 2864.939
forbidden completely forever

2861.59 --> 2864.9390000000003
[Music]

2866.26 --> 2878.1600000000003
ah it's good good to let that out

2881.46 --> 2884.61
[Music]

2895.71 --> 2901.95
oh really and Ursus they are all

2897.93 --> 2905.79
genetically modified really are they are

2901.95 --> 2908.1
they so tell me tell me how that works

2905.79 --> 2911.07
like all the plants out there are no

2908.1 --> 2913.95
longer their natural original sac type

2911.07 --> 2914.78
really that's that for real are you

2913.95 --> 2917.49
serious

2914.78 --> 2920.5800000000004
seems a little bit over generalized but

2917.49 --> 2924.93
yeah they they probably have little

2920.58 --> 2927.72
designs for mutant plants of almost

2924.93 --> 2931.41
everything they probably do want to

2927.72 --> 2934.1299999999997
literally in their insane minds replace

2931.41 --> 2937.14
God's design by their own freak

2934.13 --> 2939.81
self-destruction designs and literally

2937.14 --> 2943.64
just yeah cause the extermination of all

2939.81 --> 2946.68
life secretly the back of their minds

2943.64 --> 2950.46
I'll bet there's a lot of very insane

2946.68 --> 2956.7
new Genesis among these people very very

2950.46 --> 2958.77
bad but to say that it is already too

2956.7 --> 2960.33
late that is nonsense that is nonsense

2958.77 --> 2962.34
anyway because the only way it is

2960.33 --> 2966.45
actually going to replace everything is

2962.34 --> 2968.7000000000003
if all life would first be destroyed and

2966.45 --> 2970.98
then it would be offered as the

2968.7 --> 2973.08
replacement that's not gonna happen

2970.98 --> 2977.46
because even as long as there's just

2973.08 --> 2980.4
normal plants out there even with corn

2977.46 --> 2982.86
for example there was some PMO caught in

2980.4 --> 2985.71
there you know the problem is not like

2982.86 --> 2987.57
oh my god it is GMO infested is ruined

2985.71 --> 2990.51
forever no that was never the problem

2987.57 --> 2992.5800000000004
and I'll explain little after this now

2990.51 --> 2994.7400000000002
the problem was is that the freakin GMO

2992.58 --> 2999.81
companies would then come in and say

2994.74 --> 3002.5099999999998
they stole our freakin GMO paetynn blah

2999.81 --> 3005.99
blah blah sue them that was the problem

3002.51 --> 3009.2900000000004
because GMO doesn't in fact it doesn't

3005.99 --> 3011.75
really in fact has been proven now over

3009.29 --> 3014.18
decades right right actual studies

3011.75 --> 3017.51
actual studies I paid attention so what

3014.18 --> 3019.8799999999997
happens again here comes my adaptation

3017.51 --> 3023.1800000000003
and mutation concept that seems to be

3019.88 --> 3027.71
absolutely true so far as if it's

3023.18 --> 3028.94
mutated like GMO yeah it may cross

3027.71 --> 3031.58
pollen

3028.94 --> 3035.4500000000003
guess what just a few generations it's

3031.58 --> 3037.7599999999998
all it's gone the mutation is dead it's

3035.45 --> 3041.7799999999997
gone it's erased it's replaced by the

3037.76 --> 3043.88
viable design that's what happens that's

3041.78 --> 3046.73
what happens as long as there is a

3043.88 --> 3054.85
living original specimen of something

3046.73 --> 3057.38
out there do you see all right

3054.85 --> 3060.41
Santa I don't have a lot of good things

3057.38 --> 3062.33
to say about Monsanto especially their

3060.41 --> 3064.7
executives I think they should all

3062.33 --> 3067.5499999999997
probably end up in the Guantanamo Bay

3064.7 --> 3070.0099999999998
situation because they very much deserve

3067.55 --> 3071.6000000000004
that if they haven't already I don't

3070.01 --> 3073.4900000000002
know man I don't know what the hell they

3071.6 --> 3077.77
are I don't know why they are allowed to

3073.49 --> 3082.4199999999996
be a public company in the way they are

3077.77 --> 3085.67
to be openly evil for the world to just

3082.42 --> 3087.53
yeah Wario four and all that [ __ ] and or

3085.67 --> 3090.23
gush over the financial possibilities

3087.53 --> 3092.6000000000004
whatever I don't know why it is there I

3090.23 --> 3094.22
don't know it doesn't make real sense to

3092.6 --> 3096.67
me I don't get it why it hasn't been

3094.22 --> 3100.1899999999996
shut down and everybody arrested yet

3096.67 --> 3104.4500000000003
except for uh maybe we could use this

3100.19 --> 3111.01
acha apocalyptic weapon just by a

3104.45 --> 3115.64
warfare like public funded bio warfare

3111.01 --> 3118.69
maybe that is why Monsanto existed it's

3115.64 --> 3118.69
pretty freakin disgusting

3125.49 --> 3128.79
[Music]

3151.55 --> 3157.9300000000003
it

3153.92 --> 3157.9300000000003
okay Michael be sure

3173.53 --> 3184.6600000000003
yeah I said check out what if already

3181.66 --> 3187.5099999999998
almost everyone knows somebody with

3184.66 --> 3190.3599999999997
Corona it's just that you don't really

3187.51 --> 3194.6800000000003
notice it because it's not much of a

3190.36 --> 3196.9
cold it's not really that impressive you

3194.68 --> 3198.94
know the I don't know if anybody has

3196.9 --> 3203.05
paid attention to it keep on harping on

3198.94 --> 3205.09
this subtly as I can but yeah it's

3203.05 --> 3208.9300000000003
supposed to be extremely infectious but

3205.09 --> 3211.6600000000003
really not dangerous compared to just

3208.93 --> 3215.1699999999996
regular flu that is everywhere every

3211.66 --> 3220.7799999999997
time so it's just like yeah how would

3215.17 --> 3221.98
you know why would it matter it's

3220.78 --> 3228.28
ridiculous

3221.98 --> 3231.13
Oh ridiculous it always was they gave

3228.28 --> 3233.5
you the data that you should put

3231.13 --> 3235.33
together and then conclude this is all

3233.5 --> 3237.37
ridiculous and if you can't do it

3235.33 --> 3240.64
because you're spellbound by the haha oh

3237.37 --> 3243.3599999999997
the end of the world you you can ruin it

3240.64 --> 3247.9
yeah then you're an idiot

3243.36 --> 3250.1400000000003
yeah because you should just be putting

3247.9 --> 3253.96
the pieces together and then realize

3250.14 --> 3255.7
conclude through critical thinking that

3253.96 --> 3259.51
it is nothing

3255.7 --> 3261.6699999999996
it's literally flu season a thing maybe

3259.51 --> 3264.25
somebody did something somewhere but

3261.67 --> 3267.36
here are the statistics it's [ __ ]

3264.25 --> 3270.22
it's literally nothing to worry about

3267.36 --> 3273.4900000000002
worry about the regular flu it's much

3270.22 --> 3276.1
more dangerous ok and it's everywhere

3273.49 --> 3278.58
anyway so yeah what's the point there's

3276.1 --> 3278.58
no point

3294.68 --> 3301.41
right well Mykleby yeah I know the

3298.98 --> 3303.48
Netherlands is a very much in

3301.41 --> 3306.39
internationalist country that is just

3303.48 --> 3310.5
very small very dependent on the

3306.39 --> 3312.12
international trade so yeah as long as

3310.5 --> 3314.37
there's problems with international

3312.12 --> 3317.67
trade yeah we're going to have problems

3314.37 --> 3322.7999999999997
one way or the other so yeah we're

3317.67 --> 3325.11
noticing that it's very annoying because

3322.8 --> 3331.34
what you get when you get overly

3325.11 --> 3333.9900000000002
dependent on cheap as imports yeah

3331.34 --> 3336.1200000000003
because they're pathetic because the

3333.99 --> 3339.87
Dutch are pathetic they can't help it

3336.12 --> 3343.23
it's like this costs less here are a

3339.87 --> 3345.39
giant list of consequences here are

3343.23 --> 3347.55
small lists of consequences I'll take

3345.39 --> 3350.58
the smaller one because it is cheaper

3347.55 --> 3353.1000000000004
and then that justifies absolutely

3350.58 --> 3355.02
everything because you can literally

3353.1 --> 3357.12
tell anybody in the Nantz why I got this

3355.02 --> 3358.95
it's cheaper and it's like almost

3357.12 --> 3363.69
automatically like people are like ooh

3358.95 --> 3366.5699999999997
nice like we have this terrible terrible

3363.69 --> 3368.82
I don't know you could call grassroots

3366.57 --> 3370.71
grab ler culture I guess you know Dutch

3368.82 --> 3373.02
pride themselves in being the inventors

3370.71 --> 3376.38
of banking and all that that's just

3373.02 --> 3377.31
cheaper so you must do that no matter

3376.38 --> 3379.86
the cost

3377.31 --> 3384.45
that kind of insane mentality you know a

3379.86 --> 3387.51
lot of that is kind of move run and

3384.45 --> 3389.97
change into liberal culture oh goodie

3387.51 --> 3393.9900000000002
what a fantastical replacement that is

3389.97 --> 3398.1499999999996
into well it's pretty much the same [ __ ]

3393.99 --> 3401.31
but exactly from the other side so yeah

3398.15 --> 3404.04
the Netherlands is just yeah on the

3401.31 --> 3407.91
other hands yeah what can you do we're a

3404.04 --> 3410.19
small country it has always been a trade

3407.91 --> 3411.99
based country so it's always gonna have

3410.19 --> 3413.88
this type of issue one way or the other

3411.99 --> 3421.2799999999997
it would just be good if we would be

3413.88 --> 3426.27
less in the dependent on outside imports

3421.28 --> 3428.25
just to also just not overextend over

3426.27 --> 3432.57
expand over invest

3428.25 --> 3435.06
just not be a metropolitan as much not

3432.57 --> 3437.869
exclusively because it's gonna break

3435.06 --> 3440.7599999999998
there's always what's the danger and

3437.869 --> 3443.79
yeah the people making these giant

3440.76 --> 3446.01
amounts of money here politicians and on

3443.79 --> 3447.81
mega corporations yeah they they don't

3446.01 --> 3450.75
give a [ __ ]

3447.81 --> 3456.2999999999997
not really they only give a [ __ ] as long

3450.75 --> 3458.849
as it still can hurt their wallet but

3456.3 --> 3461.6090000000004
they are just international traders and

3458.849 --> 3465.9900000000002
they if something goes bang they just

3461.609 --> 3470.0099999999998
move on so they don't really care about

3465.99 --> 3472.5899999999997
the dangers on the long run being an

3470.01 --> 3474.51
international country like that they're

3472.59 --> 3476.6400000000003
just going with the cheap trade and

3474.51 --> 3478.8
they're so look the numbers we got the

3476.64 --> 3480.93
cheapest we got the cheapest plan see

3478.8 --> 3483.75
see you just don't talk about what's

3480.93 --> 3491.6699999999996
gonna happen in 20 years hey yeah that's

3483.75 --> 3494.0
the Netherlands yeah but yeah don't

3491.67 --> 3497.25
worry they're now replacing it with

3494.0 --> 3502.13
climate change hysteria which is exactly

3497.25 --> 3502.13
the opposite and even less useful we

3502.67 --> 3509.2200000000003
it's like oh no we have to we have to

3506.46 --> 3511.26
get rid of all gas here no more gas just

3509.22 --> 3515.43
let's replace it with extremely

3511.26 --> 3517.9500000000003
inefficient nature destroying things

3515.43 --> 3521.0699999999997
they'll make everything terrible and not

3517.95 --> 3523.8799999999997
fix the problem that seems to be like

3521.07 --> 3527.55
the leftist strategy now and it is

3523.88 --> 3530.099
getting quite aggravating to look at I

3527.55 --> 3535.02
think that a lot of people agree on that

3530.099 --> 3537.2400000000002
is that we're really sick of like the

3535.02 --> 3540.66
climate change left us here like really

3537.24 --> 3543.2599999999998
sick of it because they're trying to

3540.66 --> 3548.8799999999997
make us live almost literally sacrifice

3543.26 --> 3550.71
ourselves just to go with the the saving

3548.88 --> 3552.75
the planet like they're almost literally

3550.71 --> 3557.82
trying to make us kill ourselves almost

3552.75 --> 3559.5
literally it's so bad and people are

3557.82 --> 3561.3
catching up on it it's just like no

3559.5 --> 3564.0
you've got to stop it now

3561.3 --> 3571.5600000000004
take the reins away from these people

3564.0 --> 3574.91
take it away take them away it's over

3571.56 --> 3579.45
that [ __ ] should be over quick Lee

3574.91 --> 3581.6099999999997
but just get back gas always was a good

3579.45 --> 3582.45
thing natural gas is great there's a lot

3581.61 --> 3585.3
being offered

3582.45 --> 3588.5099999999998
oh no no Russia and has all that yeah

3585.3 --> 3591.3900000000003
yeah yeah yeah get the gas just stop

3588.51 --> 3594.75
whining stop being a politicized little

3591.39 --> 3598.0699999999997
[ __ ] and move on and just get a

3594.75 --> 3604.41
practical solution here instead of the

3598.07 --> 3609.11
idiotic biomass generators it's just so

3604.41 --> 3612.12
so terrible and the freakin windmills

3609.11 --> 3615.09
you know that is terrible all of that is

3612.12 --> 3618.93
just it sucks it sucks

3615.09 --> 3621.63
it's a horrible waste of nature horrible

3618.93 --> 3623.85
and it doesn't help anything it doesn't

3621.63 --> 3626.79
help your freakin co2 problem it's just

3623.85 --> 3629.43
making it worse and it isn't even a

3626.79 --> 3631.74
problem but if you'd assume it's a

3629.43 --> 3636.21
problem it actually make it worse yeah

3631.74 --> 3641.7299999999996
so get rid of these freakin lunatics get

3636.21 --> 3648.45
rid of these industrial cultists get

3641.73 --> 3652.55
them out get them out let's just get

3648.45 --> 3654.96
freakin sensible let's just go with

3652.55 --> 3656.4900000000002
efficiency industry things that are

3654.96 --> 3658.55
there there have been very long-term

3656.49 --> 3666.99
there that have improved a great deal

3658.55 --> 3669.0
just use gasoline use gas works great it

3666.99 --> 3671.6699999999996
works great thinks they're so efficient

3669.0 --> 3674.94
now you just

3671.67 --> 3677.07
oh no it's such a problem well just make

3674.94 --> 3680.4
sure you design the things to make them

3677.07 --> 3682.26
efficient and then problem solved it's

3680.4 --> 3684.6
gonna cost very very little

3682.26 --> 3688.2900000000004
oh no the oil industry doesn't actually

3684.6 --> 3690.69
like that well yeah see that's the funny

3688.29 --> 3694.48
thing when you have all these giant

3690.69 --> 3696.73
corporation industry empires they

3694.48 --> 3700.0
don't want things to be cheap for anyone

3696.73 --> 3702.21
they don't want that so if you're gonna

3700.0 --> 3705.7
be purely dependent on these mega

3702.21 --> 3709.18
concerns conglomerates you're always

3705.7 --> 3711.43
gonna be screwed so you just have to

3709.18 --> 3715.24
take the matters into your own hands and

3711.43 --> 3717.97
stop the nonsense stop being stared by

3715.24 --> 3723.49
mega corporations and just make sensible

3717.97 --> 3726.1299999999997
decisions like just get back to coal if

3723.49 --> 3733.18
that is that is the possibility get back

3726.13 --> 3736.8
to fuel get back to gas and let's build

3733.18 --> 3736.7999999999997
some sensible stuff with that

3739.93 --> 3744.819
and I know they love the whole [ __ ]

3742.63 --> 3746.98
about the gas in in Friesland and all

3744.819 --> 3748.799
that and all the yeah the damage is

3746.98 --> 3751.39
causing to certain villages and all that

3748.799 --> 3755.069
yeah that is kind of annoying isn't it

3751.39 --> 3762.46
I totally get that on the other hand

3755.069 --> 3766.2599999999998
well how ya like is is it running out

3762.46 --> 3769.059
anyway or is this like because yeah

3766.26 --> 3773.289
independence you know it's levels of

3769.059 --> 3776.65
Independence for a country not a

3773.289 --> 3781.4500000000003
freaking village for a country is really

3776.65 --> 3782.17
important so maybe yeah maybe these

3781.45 --> 3784.1189999999997
people

3782.17 --> 3786.46
the entire village should just yeah it's

3784.119 --> 3788.26
9 oh they wanted to grow older and they

3786.46 --> 3791.079
don't want anything to change ever I

3788.26 --> 3792.25
know all all all people want don't want

3791.079 --> 3796.599
that that's very simple

3792.25 --> 3799.529
maybe just get like okay let's get this

3796.599 --> 3803.319
over with go full-on

3799.529 --> 3806.5
get it all out like me yeah turn it into

3803.319 --> 3807.97
industrial area for a gas extraction and

3806.5 --> 3809.95
like get the villages out of the way

3807.97 --> 3812.22
just build them somewhere else build

3809.95 --> 3816.25
something somewhere else replace it

3812.22 --> 3818.4399999999996
because it's not about oh that might be

3816.25 --> 3822.46
a little more expensive now it is about

3818.44 --> 3826.48
we need to that gas to be here in the

3822.46 --> 3827.559
Netherlands itself that is my view on

3826.48 --> 3831.789
and it's probably going to be very

3827.559 --> 3837.369
unpopular now but yeah self-sufficiency

3831.789 --> 3841.5690000000004
is worth a lot it is doesn't mean that

3837.369 --> 3843.13
we should not import any gas foreign

3841.569 --> 3846.94
countries now of course that it's very

3843.13 --> 3851.73
important that we can be self-sufficient

3846.94 --> 3851.73
here that's just my point

3853.46 --> 3859.89
and yeah very sorry people in villages

3858.42 --> 3861.809
that want to live there and just

3859.89 --> 3862.529
everything to be as it is I know it's

3861.809 --> 3870.509
very sucky

3862.529 --> 3871.89
but maybe you should yeah maybe you

3870.509 --> 3877.109
should all figure out another way to

3871.89 --> 3879.359
approach this I know I wouldn't mind if

3877.109 --> 3883.259
it were just completely nationalized you

3879.359 --> 3885.44
know like deep privatized why doesn't

3883.259 --> 3888.45
the Netherlands just D privatize again

3885.44 --> 3891.69
privatization has been really all that

3888.45 --> 3894.299
great you know privatized companies are

3891.69 --> 3896.75
very much subject to political influence

3894.299 --> 3899.909
and it's terrible

3896.75 --> 3899.909
[Music]

3905.619 --> 3908.619
anyway

3919.589 --> 3925.499
mmm-hmm brown coal mine coal plants are

3923.759 --> 3929.39
you are they bad I don't know could be

3925.499 --> 3932.339
all I know is that all these types of

3929.39 --> 3934.799
power plants energy ways of generating

3932.339 --> 3939.18
energy using specific resource they can

3934.799 --> 3941.67
all now be heavily modernized to not

3939.18 --> 3944.759
have pollution and to be much more

3941.67 --> 3947.699
efficient it don't underestimate how

3944.759 --> 3950.039
much industrial development actually

3947.699 --> 3952.439
improves things and makes them more

3950.039 --> 3957.449
efficient and cleaner if it is just

3952.439 --> 3959.8489999999997
needed and we should use that don't drop

3957.449 --> 3961.619
it because of past transgressions okay

3959.849 --> 3964.259
yeah remember the early

3961.619 --> 3966.619
industrialization age with all the

3964.259 --> 3970.049
factories and all the the coal plants

3966.619 --> 3973.4390000000003
yeah that was horrific because they

3970.049 --> 3975.479
didn't scrub anything and then gases and

3973.439 --> 3977.8799999999997
smoke would go out with fluoride and it

3975.479 --> 3980.489
would poison [ __ ] literally like dead

3977.88 --> 3982.6800000000003
pools with dead fish because of that

3980.489 --> 3987.329
yeah because it's poisonous well guess

3982.68 --> 3989.16
what that was 200 years ago probably a

3987.329 --> 3992.369
little less under 50 years I don't know

3989.16 --> 3995.819
somewhere over there in the past it's

3992.369 --> 3998.2490000000003
changed a lot since then even in the

3995.819 --> 4002.929
20th century you know it wasn't perfect

3998.249 --> 4007.1789999999996
but it's it's getting better don't drop

4002.929 --> 4010.719
it don't stop it it's getting better and

4007.179 --> 4014.6600000000003
we've even learned things like hey oil

4010.719 --> 4017.449
replenishes okay so that problem is out

4014.66 --> 4021.319
of the way you know things running out I

4017.449 --> 4023.63
don't know the same for coal I don't

4021.319 --> 4025.759
know because yeah well there is probably

4023.63 --> 4028.1600000000003
just a lot of coal around but yeah I

4025.759 --> 4032.439
don't see it replenishing itself there's

4028.16 --> 4035.359
still a lot of it around but yeah fuel

4032.439 --> 4039.949
even abiotic oil it seems to replenish

4035.359 --> 4043.839
so why the hell would you drop that type

4039.949 --> 4047.109
of technology it's absolute madness

4043.839 --> 4050.449
absolute madness

4047.109 --> 4051.709
yeah and these electric cars also here

4050.449 --> 4053.42
you know that are property and it's

4051.709 --> 4057.74
getting blatantly obvious that

4053.42 --> 4062.48
it's just [ __ ] it's energy-consuming

4057.74 --> 4067.5789999999997
crap and it's just for the rich snobby

4062.48 --> 4069.829
shitty green people that gloat over that

4067.579 --> 4072.29
[ __ ] all day long while they actually

4069.829 --> 4075.7400000000002
cause brownouts in their area because of

4072.29 --> 4079.97
that [ __ ] yeah so electric cars are a

4075.74 --> 4082.97
disaster at least again they might grow

4079.97 --> 4085.1899999999996
more efficient that's that's a

4082.97 --> 4085.8489999999997
possibility but what is out there now it

4085.19 --> 4089.4500000000003
sucks

4085.849 --> 4095.5
literally sucks the electricity it sucks

4089.45 --> 4099.739
a lot it's incredibly wasteful

4095.5 --> 4102.91
incredibly wasteful do you get it

4099.739 --> 4110.0
leftists do you get it greenies it's

4102.91 --> 4111.5289999999995
incredibly wasteful okay so don't you

4110.0 --> 4113.839
freaking call yourself an

4111.529 --> 4119.14
environmentalist if you have an electric

4113.839 --> 4119.14
car like that it's incredibly wasteful

4122.469 --> 4128.81
well join up though sure you know what

4125.83 --> 4130.2789999999995
sure it'll work great in Norway well why

4128.81 --> 4132.56
would it work right in Norway well

4130.279 --> 4135.620000000001
probably because Norway just has a lot

4132.56 --> 4138.17
of electricity production so they just

4135.62 --> 4140.5599999999995
can take it it's still gonna just pump

4138.17 --> 4145.2390000000005
out Utes amount of energy you know

4140.56 --> 4149.4800000000005
because electric cars are a huge waste

4145.239 --> 4152.839
they cost so much electricity to produce

4149.48 --> 4157.089
that it's a waste it's much worse than

4152.839 --> 4157.089
using fuel much worse

4160.589 --> 4168.039
I'd rather go for what is it hydrogen

4164.17 --> 4170.109
based fuels or at least diesel you know

4168.039 --> 4174.159
Diesel's even better than than just

4170.109 --> 4176.1990000000005
gasoline but hydrogen based could even

4174.159 --> 4179.228999999999
be better than that on the other hand

4176.199 --> 4181.478999999999
like yeah what is it actually not too

4179.229 --> 4184.689
sure but yeah even back in the day like

4181.479 --> 4186.609
10 years ago I I caught on to hydrogen

4184.689 --> 4192.159000000001
based engines even knew a guy that

4186.609 --> 4195.4890000000005
designed things concerning that and he's

4192.159 --> 4198.159
yeah he's kind of become a industrialist

4195.489 --> 4199.509999999999
though so that's producing these things

4198.159 --> 4201.28
I don't know what's going on with him

4199.51 --> 4203.499
might have turned into a complete

4201.28 --> 4205.018999999999
traveler now I don't know it kind of

4203.499 --> 4207.13
happens when you get like this heavy

4205.019 --> 4210.849
industrial patents you develop him

4207.13 --> 4214.09
yourself you tend to get locked into

4210.849 --> 4217.2390000000005
that system of information control and

4214.09 --> 4219.039
all that but yeah back then even then it

4217.239 --> 4221.32
seemed like a very sensible thing and

4219.039 --> 4224.8
then there was of course the hydrogen

4221.32 --> 4227.978999999999
bus buses in the Netherlands and that

4224.8 --> 4230.579000000001
project kind of failed because it was so

4227.979 --> 4233.26
positively dangerous and all that and

4230.579 --> 4236.17
that didn't seem to work all that great

4233.26 --> 4238.51
well that's because they used freaking

4236.17 --> 4240.189
storage tanks there's no sense to me

4238.51 --> 4242.559
there that could be dangerous storage

4240.189 --> 4246.039000000001
tanks with hydrogen why why would you do

4242.559 --> 4252.249
that it's ridiculous no just produce it

4246.039 --> 4256.869
on the spot electrolyze water turning it

4252.249 --> 4259.179
into hydrogen on the spots directly in

4256.869 --> 4260.978999999999
front of the engine so they're literally

4259.179 --> 4262.179
there's no danger there's no danger

4260.979 --> 4264.459
there because you got a big tank of

4262.179 --> 4267.729
water the water's not dangerous

4264.459 --> 4269.559
no no it's only the hydrogen that could

4267.729 --> 4271.84
be potentially explosive well what if it

4269.559 --> 4274.09
was just literally generated as it is

4271.84 --> 4281.189
going into the engine how much hydrogen

4274.09 --> 4281.189
would exist at the same time not a lot

4281.429 --> 4289.89
right that was 10 years ago

4286.51 --> 4292.54
now everything electric cars do Tesla

4289.89 --> 4296.05
electric cars whoa what about the

4292.54 --> 4298.39
freakin hydrogen engines with a system

4296.05 --> 4301.0
where there would not be any storage

4298.39 --> 4302.59
containers for hydrogen needed it would

4301.0 --> 4305.77
literally all be water and you would

4302.59 --> 4309.88
make hydrogen of it on the spot very

4305.77 --> 4314.17
efficiently why is that not a universal

4309.88 --> 4318.34
thing now may I remind you that using

4314.17 --> 4323.68
that process is literally not gonna

4318.34 --> 4328.57
produce any co2 anything not a single

4323.68 --> 4329.02
speck of it so it's like do you see what

4328.57 --> 4334.349999999999
I mean

4329.02 --> 4339.040000000001
all of it co2 all of it it is Oh a giant

4334.35 --> 4342.7300000000005
scam it is a giant energy consuming

4339.04 --> 4345.1
panic based scam all these

4342.73 --> 4346.929999999999
environmentalists that say that co2 is a

4345.1 --> 4349.3
problem the China climate changes its

4346.93 --> 4354.39
problem or they all offer solutions that

4349.3 --> 4354.39
cost more energy that create more waste

4354.87 --> 4361.93
all of it does that have you noticed

4358.9 --> 4364.36
this have you noticed this

4361.93 --> 4368.02
that everything they do is an

4364.36 --> 4370.65
environmental disaster per default their

4368.02 --> 4374.5
solutions is cut down an entire forest

4370.65 --> 4376.2699999999995
their solution their solution is cut off

4374.5 --> 4378.67
certain type of resources all of a

4376.27 --> 4381.700000000001
sudden so chaos will ensue so people

4378.67 --> 4386.01
will start to waste and damage things to

4381.7 --> 4391.96
try to fix it that is what they do

4386.01 --> 4396.09
it's a giant disaster environmentalists

4391.96 --> 4402.0
that arc on the climate change scam are

4396.09 --> 4409.42
anti environmentalists and I hate them a

4402.0 --> 4414.239
lot they are sinners they are two-faced

4409.42 --> 4420.06
double speaking liars they are satanic

4414.239 --> 4426.29
robbers of energy and wealth scammers /

4420.06 --> 4432.240000000001
default with no escape they are evil and

4426.29 --> 4435.84
they will be stopped because if you

4432.24 --> 4454.7699999999995
don't it's all gonna be a giant trash

4435.84 --> 4456.81
heap and no more civilization hey thanks

4454.77 --> 4461.540000000001
Michael B for the $10 ship which other

4456.81 --> 4461.54
nation you have a good weekend as well

4476.46 --> 4479.67
[Music]

4484.48 --> 4489.58
no really new English be really you

4487.449 --> 4494.11
think there's free energy do you think

4489.58 --> 4496.6
sup or do you think there's just easily

4494.11 --> 4499.12
accessible and efficient energy because

4496.6 --> 4502.33
I think that there is that things can be

4499.12 --> 4504.429
extremely efficient absurdly efficient

4502.33 --> 4506.5599999999995
that it would the energy cost could be

4504.429 --> 4510.6990000000005
insignificant I don't think there's

4506.56 --> 4512.77
unlimited energy though so don't don't

4510.699 --> 4516.25
go with that fantasy because again

4512.77 --> 4519.780000000001
unlimited does not exist in the physical

4516.25 --> 4524.86
reality you got to get that three right

4519.78 --> 4527.23
but yeah easy accessible energy yeah

4524.86 --> 4529.449
sure there's energy in the air we could

4527.23 --> 4534.928999999999
probably use that but to assume that

4529.449 --> 4534.928999999999
that is infinite is a mistake cannot be

4536.73 --> 4541.959999999999
but I'm sure there's plenty of it

4539.52 --> 4543.55
but if you start to assume that it is

4541.96 --> 4546.82
infinite you're gonna build a new

4543.55 --> 4550.570000000001
problem because then you're gonna tap

4546.82 --> 4552.489
into it until something something breaks

4550.57 --> 4555.759999999999
and we don't even know what that is

4552.489 --> 4558.669999999999
because we probably don't fully

4555.76 --> 4562.66
understand the nature of this energy

4558.67 --> 4567.54
that is easily available in the air so

4562.66 --> 4567.54
yeah be careful what you wish for

4573.37 --> 4578.049
[Music]

4580.36 --> 4591.299999999999
no sir check oh no that's no I don't see

4587.92 --> 4591.3
the circle right there

4596.15 --> 4603.009999999999
garbage is just garbage and yeah you

4599.9 --> 4606.679
could probably burn some of it up and

4603.01 --> 4608.6900000000005
maybe even harness some of the energy

4606.679 --> 4611.63
that comes from the burning but after

4608.69 --> 4613.94
that's done they're still going to be

4611.63 --> 4617.5
junk left that cannot be used for any

4613.94 --> 4620.719
type of energy and it can be reused

4617.5 --> 4625.219
unless well products are specifically

4620.719 --> 4630.19
designed to not leave remnant waste that

4625.219 --> 4630.19
lasts forever yeah

4641.929 --> 4646.1
yeah that's very nice England you

4644.0 --> 4648.17
English me that's really great but

4646.1 --> 4651.1990000000005
there's still no unlimited energy

4648.17 --> 4654.159
because unlimited Ness does not exist in

4651.199 --> 4654.159
physical reality

4674.96 --> 4683.34
[Music]

4680.36 --> 4687.57
maybe search echo I don't know I don't

4683.34 --> 4692.579
know I hope so I hope you're right I am

4687.57 --> 4694.98
kind of in the hopes that indeed the

4692.579 --> 4698.999
entire material content of this realm

4694.98 --> 4701.098999999999
can and does recycle itself that for all

4698.999 --> 4704.579
the things that we harvest from the

4701.099 --> 4707.67
earth and mine and disintegrate because

4704.579 --> 4710.549999999999
things do disintegrate that for

4707.67 --> 4713.7300000000005
everything that goes missing it will

4710.55 --> 4716.789
somehow be replenished on the other side

4713.73 --> 4720.48
or at the bottoms up either I hope so

4716.789 --> 4722.55
I really like the idea of that but I

4720.48 --> 4726.539
don't know if it is it could literally

4722.55 --> 4728.969
all very very very slowly be running out

4726.539 --> 4732.268999999999
and that at some point there will be no

4728.969 --> 4738.26
more there will be nothing there will be

4732.269 --> 4738.26
nothing left I don't know I don't know

4741.8 --> 4747.92
I really hope there is a

4745.21 --> 4750.11
self-replenishing mechanism I really

4747.92 --> 4752.51
hope so because yeah the more we figure

4750.11 --> 4755.15
out how precious certain resources are

4752.51 --> 4756.83
the more they're going to be dug out or

4755.15 --> 4759.17
what where's that resource going to be

4756.83 --> 4761.15
you know think then after a hundred

4759.17 --> 4762.74
years all these resources will all be

4761.15 --> 4765.71
depleted and what you're going to do

4762.74 --> 4769.69
then nothing just nothing is it just

4765.71 --> 4772.82
gonna not be there anymore so I hope

4769.69 --> 4776.45
like for example things like pure iodine

4772.82 --> 4779.09
that they are replenished because you

4776.45 --> 4781.28
can't create that people don't know how

4779.09 --> 4787.58
to themselves create it as far as I know

4781.28 --> 4789.679999999999
I don't know maybe it could be somehow

4787.58 --> 4791.21
transmuted or something but yeah I

4789.68 --> 4793.7300000000005
didn't know if you know that might even

4791.21 --> 4796.9
cost a lot of excess of energy even to

4793.73 --> 4796.9
do that so I don't know

4812.21 --> 4819.62
ha love wisdom harmony that's funny

4815.78 --> 4821.75
well water as co2 in it as well

4819.62 --> 4824.39
especially with all the breathing

4821.75 --> 4827.48
creatures that breathe in it or breathe

4824.39 --> 4829.9400000000005
out in it it dissolves co2 also

4827.48 --> 4833.509999999999
dissolves in water you know you know

4829.94 --> 4836.87
like when you have a can with fizz in it

4833.51 --> 4839.12
that's co2 that's dissolved in it that

4836.87 --> 4842.57
naturally happens not a lot of it not a

4839.12 --> 4845.89
lot will stay but some of it does so

4842.57 --> 4845.889999999999
there is co2 in the water

4863.31 --> 4869.97
yeah but love wisdom harmony that is

4865.8 --> 4874.38
only yeah under the pressure there is

4869.97 --> 4875.91
just more co2 dissolved but yeah you

4874.38 --> 4877.9800000000005
might have noticed that you know in the

4875.91 --> 4880.889999999999
ocean especially deep there's quite a

4877.98 --> 4884.73
lot of pressure so one could argue that

4880.89 --> 4889.5
there's then more gas average amounts of

4884.73 --> 4892.53
dissolved in it as well because there is

4889.5 --> 4894.51
creatures there there is co2 co2 being

4892.53 --> 4897.12
produced it's going to be released there

4894.51 --> 4898.47
and some of it is going to dissolve and

4897.12 --> 4902.7
because the pressures high it's gonna

4898.47 --> 4904.79
stay dissolved probably you know as the

4902.7 --> 4910.11
processes are kind of difficult to

4904.79 --> 4913.05
oversee but yeah water ocean water it

4910.11 --> 4916.099999999999
does contain co2 if it didn't there

4913.05 --> 4916.1
would be no plant life

4916.94 --> 4922.32
except for those that feed exclusively

4919.38 --> 4926.06
of methane and all that because that's a

4922.32 --> 4926.0599999999995
no-no different type of life form

4955.51 --> 4963.09
uh stone monkey 3d no I'm pretty sure

4959.98 --> 4963.089999999999
that is complete hogwash

4964.559 --> 4971.349
CS who does not do that

4967.769 --> 4973.719
you know how much co2 you need to

4971.349 --> 4978.96
actually dissolve in water to make it

4973.719 --> 4978.96
acidic that's crazy

4980.219 --> 4986.889
you'd need that ring to pass through

4983.32 --> 4991.71
almost pure co2 that's really not that

4986.889 --> 4991.71
doesn't happen in reality man come on

5004.099 --> 5009.4400000000005
all right Oh have you ever considered

5006.73 --> 5013.79
that maybe the thing that surrouding

5009.44 --> 5015.638999999999
buildings is something other than co2

5013.79 --> 5019.09
dissolved in the rain

5015.639 --> 5019.09
could it be that

5020.35 --> 5024.899
[Music]

5044.659 --> 5047.32
hmm

5047.469 --> 5053.199
yeah yeah I'm pretty sure that any

5050.85 --> 5056.370000000001
eroding that's gonna happen on buildings

5053.199 --> 5060.07
is gonna be something other than co2

5056.37 --> 5062.14
dissolving in rainwater so monkey 3 is

5060.07 --> 5064.63
kind of ridiculous I'm serious

5062.14 --> 5069.820000000001
can't be seriously thinking that it's

5064.63 --> 5072.719
actually co2 causing that serious did

5069.82 --> 5072.719
come on

5090.21 --> 5097.86
yeah I know carbonic acid so do you know

5094.35 --> 5104.120000000001
how that is made do you know I'm pretty

5097.86 --> 5104.12
sure that carbonic acid is not made by

5104.6 --> 5111.030000000001
say just taking air with double the

5108.63 --> 5112.59
average concentration of co2 and pumping

5111.03 --> 5115.71
that through the water I'm pretty sure

5112.59 --> 5120.12
that's not the way that carbonic acid is

5115.71 --> 5124.95
made so can you please drop the

5120.12 --> 5130.07
ridiculous train of thought come on it's

5124.95 --> 5130.07
not co2 can't be serious

5146.29 --> 5154.94
all right you're an up dog that's much

5148.49 --> 5158.5
more likely to be cosmyk yeah and yeah

5154.94 --> 5162.589999999999
the issue is that look especially

5158.5 --> 5166.04
chemical industries often they do have

5162.59 --> 5169.31
like certain types of acidic gases that

5166.04 --> 5171.8
come out of it and they don't always

5169.31 --> 5173.240000000001
know how to get it out how to fill out

5171.8 --> 5174.92
the scrub it how to get it out so

5173.24 --> 5180.139999999999
sometimes to just throw it out there and

5174.92 --> 5184.61
if that's gonna go float like yeah

5180.14 --> 5186.530000000001
that's then gonna probably get absorbed

5184.61 --> 5188.0599999999995
by rain and that may cause some kind of

5186.53 --> 5195.44
acidic rain that's typically how that

5188.06 --> 5198.410000000001
will work it's not co2 though co2 is not

5195.44 --> 5200.389999999999
a problem it never was a problem the

5198.41 --> 5203.2
other way can be a problem if you if you

5200.39 --> 5206.780000000001
are exposed to it in in insane

5203.2 --> 5208.58
extremities breathe like pure co2 yeah

5206.78 --> 5213.009999999999
you're gonna choke that doesn't happen

5208.58 --> 5213.01
in reality it just does it never

5223.789 --> 5231.469
yeah awake sauce doesn't know what the

5225.8 --> 5236.38
[ __ ] he's talking about Rufus st. to her

5231.469 --> 5244.4
Hubbins he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] liar

5236.38 --> 5246.2300000000005
deluded Luciferian okay and yeah he can

5244.4 --> 5248.629999999999
draw all this fantasy Coakley

5246.23 --> 5251.9
yeah yep you know what take little our

5248.63 --> 5255.469
win here in the past and just imagine

5251.9 --> 5258.44
whatever you like men go ahead yeah

5255.469 --> 5260.75
bring your demons out let's just see how

5258.44 --> 5262.4
disgusting a thing you can imagine I

5260.75 --> 5265.369
knew he would do Connor he was gonna go

5262.4 --> 5267.619
I don't even care you know before you

5265.369 --> 5270.289
mention him I kind of forgot he existed

5267.619 --> 5273.199
because it's just that not important to

5270.289 --> 5275.268999999999
me but I wouldn't be surprised if he

5273.199 --> 5278.69
thought about all kinds of disgusting

5275.269 --> 5282.469
[ __ ] because I bet that's what he likes

5278.69 --> 5285.71
to think about because he is a demon he

5282.469 --> 5292.519
is a Luciferian he is on the other side

5285.71 --> 5298.46
he can't help it he succumbed and he's

5292.519 --> 5302.4800000000005
creepy a [ __ ] man that guy come on it's

5298.46 --> 5304.429
total savonia maybe even worse than the

5302.48 --> 5308.509999999999
narak Dube you know every Bay is

5304.429 --> 5314.269
actually a halfway a human this guy no

5308.51 --> 5316.76
it's a creepy ass creepy ass guy huh so

5314.269 --> 5318.9800000000005
I can fantasize about me all he likes I

5316.76 --> 5321.05
knew he was gonna do that soon as I

5318.98 --> 5324.678999999999
remembered that he existed they don't

5321.05 --> 5328.719
really care because I know what I've

5324.679 --> 5334.28
been through and I'm not telling it

5328.719 --> 5336.849
because nobody should you know you got

5334.28 --> 5336.849
your own imagination

5341.449 --> 5348.119
and I don't wanna I don't wanna remember

5345.389 --> 5349.679
serious why why do you think all of this

5348.119 --> 5350.219
happened the way did because I couldn't

5349.679 --> 5352.9400000000005
handle it

5350.219 --> 5356.25
no runner remember it I'm gonna leave it

5352.94 --> 5357.629999999999
there until I figure out what I could

5356.25 --> 5361.86
potentially do with it

5357.63 --> 5364.099
and I don't think I know anything you

5361.86 --> 5367.639
know my plan right now is to just

5364.099 --> 5372.03
continue my life and try to build it up

5367.639 --> 5375.559
with all these weird choices that I made

5372.03 --> 5379.409
in my life and just move on and know

5375.559 --> 5384.360000000001
that I will never be fooled again by my

5379.409 --> 5385.94
by my Nettie that there is no evil that

5384.36 --> 5388.5
is the lesson I'm taking out of it

5385.94 --> 5390.0
because that is the lesson I apparently

5388.5 --> 5392.329
had to learn back then and couldn't

5390.0 --> 5392.329
handle

5435.14 --> 5440.37
some monkey 3d are you gonna continue

5437.67 --> 5445.5
this are you literally gonna continue a

5440.37 --> 5447.18
pro or an anti co2 kind of thing because

5445.5 --> 5450.27
if you're gonna do that if you're

5447.18 --> 5453.18
actually sort of subtly coming out as

5450.27 --> 5459.14
being a co2 alarm is I'm gonna ban you

5453.18 --> 5459.14
forever because I will not tolerate that

5461.78 --> 5469.05
because I already told you that acid

5465.81 --> 5473.1
that doesn't form from just regular or

5469.05 --> 5476.400000000001
even double normal amount of co2 being

5473.1 --> 5480.09
exposed to water or whatever it doesn't

5476.4 --> 5483.299999999999
it doesn't happen so are you going to

5480.09 --> 5487.74
continue spouting carbonic acid really

5483.3 --> 5490.08
are you are you going to keep on

5487.74 --> 5492.54
spouting that saying like that happens

5490.08 --> 5498.6
with rain that that can happen with ring

5492.54 --> 5501.69
are you gonna lie about that in here are

5498.6 --> 5503.820000000001
you are you gonna keep saying that it is

5501.69 --> 5507.419999999999
co2 that did that are you gonna lie

5503.82 --> 5510.33
about that here yeah I know I know

5507.42 --> 5513.51
with sufficient amounts of co2 you could

5510.33 --> 5515.97
probably make carbon acid right but is

5513.51 --> 5519.150000000001
that really what you think that that

5515.97 --> 5522.570000000001
happened that amount of co2 in rain

5519.15 --> 5526.71
being the carbonic acid then damaging

5522.57 --> 5531.259999999999
the bill is that what you think do you

5526.71 --> 5531.26
really think that is possible to happen

5558.059 --> 5560.929
well

5574.98 --> 5578.24
[Music]

5581.36 --> 5588.249
[Music]

5599.23 --> 5605.099999999999
I'd like a reply now perhaps a

5601.57 --> 5607.9
concession that your fantasy about

5605.1 --> 5610.63
carbonic acid causing the deterioration

5607.9 --> 5613.8099999999995
of those buildings may be a complete

5610.63 --> 5614.95
hogwash fantasy that is not possible a

5613.81 --> 5617.29
reality like that

5614.95 --> 5619.599999999999
because there you were to require too

5617.29 --> 5622.24
much co2 it can never form like that

5619.6 --> 5629.110000000001
naturally or am I gonna get a concession

5622.24 --> 5632.429999999999
for that now sound wonky 3d oh really is

5629.11 --> 5636.009999999999
e-journal though so you think that that

5632.43 --> 5640.41
carbonic acid can just naturally arrive

5636.01 --> 5644.62
like that with the regular amount of

5640.41 --> 5651.0599999999995
okay that's it man I'm done with you get

5644.62 --> 5651.0599999999995
out of here get out here

5652.18 --> 5655.279
[Music]

5657.9 --> 5661.36
[Music]

5678.229 --> 5684.229
Oh join up so you mean basically over

5683.539 --> 5688.219
the years

5684.229 --> 5692.05
erosion like what happens in nature

5688.219 --> 5697.94
remember natural erosion so is that

5692.05 --> 5700.969
carbonic acid or is that just natural

5697.94 --> 5704.15
erosion from rain over the time you know

5700.969 --> 5709.789
because I'm getting kind of sick of this

5704.15 --> 5713.42
suggestion like co2 is this acid is this

5709.789 --> 5715.67
poison I'm so sick of people forwarding

5713.42 --> 5718.1900000000005
that it makes me want to strangle them

5715.67 --> 5722.2390000000005
like you think co2 is a problem well

5718.19 --> 5724.219
choking it then choking it it's not it's

5722.239 --> 5728.57
a natural building block it's everywhere

5724.219 --> 5732.4
always has been life and co2 cannot be

5728.57 --> 5737.799999999999
taken apart there is no life without co2

5732.4 --> 5742.009999999999
drop it stop obsessing over that [ __ ] I

5737.8 --> 5745.9400000000005
mean it I mean it you gotta stop you

5742.01 --> 5747.349
gotta stop over the freakin co2 hype

5745.94 --> 5750.289
bull [ __ ]

5747.349 --> 5753.099
it's not a problem it's not a toxin it's

5750.289 --> 5756.38
not an acid it's none of those things

5753.099 --> 5760.099
it's everywhere and there would be no

5756.38 --> 5768.38
life without it stop hyping the [ __ ]

5760.099 --> 5770.809
now I'm still talking to stone monkey 3d

5768.38 --> 5774.11
I just like I can't take it when people

5770.809 --> 5777.289
bring up another co2 thing it's just

5774.11 --> 5781.089999999999
this but it does this you know it's

5777.289 --> 5784.539
still bad it's still bad no it's not

5781.09 --> 5784.539
stop it

5795.08 --> 5798.22
[Music]

5856.9 --> 5863.19
that's right

5859.23 --> 5867.299999999999
I don't know if I like do I need to get

5863.19 --> 5874.259999999999
any clearer on my stance on this do I

5867.3 --> 5876.06
need to make it any more clear is there

5874.26 --> 5879.469
something that is left to the

5876.06 --> 5879.469
interpretation here

5915.199 --> 5918.62
that's right Neal English we I bet they

5918.14 --> 5925.85
will

5918.62 --> 5929.42
awesome although I you know you could

5925.85 --> 5932.96
just instead of that I don't know just

5929.42 --> 5937.54
have like a fireplace you know fire

5932.96 --> 5941.12
makes plenty of co2 and it creates heat

5937.54 --> 5944.5
so if you can kind of control that then

5941.12 --> 5950.0599999999995
you can I don't know maybe heat up a

5944.5 --> 5953.39
room and yeah add co2 at the same time

5950.06 --> 5958.660000000001
and then yeah I know that could work

5953.39 --> 5961.34
maybe if you dose it pretty carefully

5958.66 --> 5963.61
don't want to choke in in the smoke of

5961.34 --> 5963.610000000001
course

5993.59 --> 5999.659000000001
anyway I think I'm gonna run out to show

5995.849 --> 6005.51
I gotta get it kind of want to get some

5999.659 --> 6009.92

6049.09 --> 6053.929
do with our winneth on for it haven't

6051.71 --> 6057.44
gotten to it but I will I will it I will
