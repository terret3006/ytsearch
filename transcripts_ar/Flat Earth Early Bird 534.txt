appreciated so today the weather is very

79.0 --> 88.49
warm and kind of moist and yeah it's a

86.899 --> 92.149
different type of clouds look at that

88.49 --> 96.11
interesting it's still really warm

92.149 --> 100.52
outside and yeah because of the moist

96.11 --> 103.119
and all so I'm kind of like little

100.52 --> 103.119
breath

106.42 --> 110.7
the birds are hanging around a lot

114.14 --> 123.92
oh right I saw something interesting

118.19 --> 129.82999999999998
yesterday a be not just some B it was a

123.92 --> 132.26
B there was like this long huge never

129.83 --> 134.24
seen such big creature like an insect

132.26 --> 138.62
like I thought it was a big beetle first

134.24 --> 143.05
but no it was a very big B so I think it

138.62 --> 146.84
was an African type B it had like the

143.05 --> 149.60000000000002
plaited forehead that kind of what it

146.84 --> 153.29
looked like so I think it might have

149.6 --> 156.10999999999999
been like an African bee it's very cool

153.29 --> 158.239
to see it and that thing yeah it wasn't

156.11 --> 163.13000000000002
aggressive at all it was kind of gently

158.239 --> 166.76
flying around in between B and a bumble

163.13 --> 169.88
bee but if I had a stable path and yeah

166.76 --> 173.23
I even bumped into into the balcony

169.88 --> 176.209
which would may made sounds like Bing

173.23 --> 181.42999999999998
because it's metal resonates like a harp

176.209 --> 184.43
almost and yeah so you don't want that

181.43 --> 186.92000000000002
creature to fly straight in your head at

184.43 --> 192.14000000000001
full speed because that's gonna hurt a

186.92 --> 196.1
lot but I saw that yeah very cool just

192.14 --> 198.64999999999998
standing here looking outside all these

196.1 --> 202.489
kinds of things come flying by very

198.65 --> 204.65
interesting anyway I have two Mara

202.489 --> 206.03
coffee with me today hoof I don't know

204.65 --> 210.489
if that was such a good idea what its

206.03 --> 217.33
heat but I got it anyway and green tea

210.489 --> 223.01

Sunday edition point each I went to bed

266.51 --> 279.77
really early again yesterday yeah was it

275.08 --> 282.38
one o'clock again but in contrast the

279.77 --> 286.84999999999997
last time I don't know this time didn't

282.38 --> 293.71
sleep super super well I don't know what

286.85 --> 295.91
it was yeah I remember doubt what I

293.71 --> 297.68
guess because of the moist and

295.91 --> 301.1
everything throughout the morning I did

297.68 --> 307.46
it was just overheating a lot sweating a

301.1 --> 310.13
lot it was kind of annoying yeah on a

307.46 --> 317.09
hot moist day like this it's very common

310.13 --> 320.39
that I'll just not be in top form it

317.09 --> 321.78999999999996
might pick up a little you know it's

358.23 --> 362.43
up

358.97 --> 364.17
Nathan's show that I thought was gonna

362.43 --> 367.59000000000003
come after but he hasn't played it yet I

364.17 --> 369.66
think because he played d1 episode again

367.59 --> 371.28
it's the third time now what it was a

369.66 --> 373.53000000000003
really good show and I listened

371.28 --> 376.85999999999996
throughout it again it was just a great

373.53 --> 381.2
show I was a part of it too and I

376.86 --> 384.6
thought that my my performance was good

381.2 --> 388.52
so but yeah I think that Nathan's still

384.6 --> 388.52000000000004
gonna play it somewhere this afternoon

391.7 --> 397.97999999999996

410.7 --> 418.19
that's a very funny sleeping warrior

415.14 --> 420.81
thank you for the two-pound super chat

418.19 --> 425.19
the super jet is for Randy but yeah

420.81 --> 427.08
that's not gonna work if you want to

425.19 --> 432.75
give it to Randy then you're gonna have

427.08 --> 434.64
to give it to him on his show because by

432.75 --> 436.74
the time I get anything out of it yeah

434.64 --> 439.89
what you want me to super chitchat him

436.74 --> 443.85
for ten cents that something like that

439.89 --> 447.3
no no no I'm that's definitely not gonna

443.85 --> 455.27000000000004
do that very funny eh the meets Kang and

447.3 --> 464.46000000000004
Guns of Navarone that I Ohio gather

455.27 --> 466.34999999999997
Asian Hornet no but no killer no it was

464.46 --> 472.85999999999996
a very gentle creature I think it was

466.35 --> 475.38
the the thought long-lost a certain type

472.86 --> 477.75
of African bee I even mentioned it on

475.38 --> 481.59
this show that I had bumped into the

477.75 --> 484.8
article and that's like a year ago like

481.59 --> 487.95
hey this creature thought was died out

484.8 --> 489.39
has appeared again so I think it might

487.95 --> 495.18
have been that well maybe they're like

489.39 --> 497.58
going all around the world but it was a

495.18 --> 499.85
gentle creature and it was this in it

497.58 --> 504.45
you know a normal B is like this big

499.85 --> 507.93
typical honeybee and maybe you have like

504.45 --> 511.14
the the earth bees the ones that that

507.93 --> 513.84
are so so low they're like this big this

511.14 --> 517.8
one was like this it was so huge five

513.84 --> 521.58
centimeters at least from tail to head

517.8 --> 525.2099999999999
and just very thick so I thought it was

521.58 --> 531.72
like a big beetle at first but it did

525.21 --> 534.7800000000001
have the orange and black so then I

531.72 --> 536.7900000000001
thought oh this is a very big wasp but

534.78 --> 538.6999999999999
it didn't behave like a wasp and it

536.79 --> 543.2199999999999
didn't have such a tight

538.7 --> 545.7090000000001
compartmentalized exoskeleton like

543.22 --> 551.769
so it was definitely be it was much more

545.709 --> 555.01
a whole much more a typical interest

551.769 --> 560.17
yeah bodily structure of being from what

555.01 --> 562.0
I could see and you know what I would

560.17 --> 579.88
never stand still this one was just more

562.0 --> 581.5
like did you get a picture no I know I

579.88 --> 585.279
was kind of stunned by what I saw the

581.5 --> 587.29
first place and yeah it flew away like

585.279 --> 589.48
after a minute by the time I would have

587.29 --> 594.04
caught my camera it would have been gone

589.48 --> 597.19
anyway you know if I want to pick up

594.04 --> 600.43
that kind of thing I'd have to have like

597.19 --> 602.9200000000001
a you know an outside cam that's just

600.43 --> 604.8599999999999
recording 24/7 and I might pick up all

602.92 --> 613.17
kinds of interesting things

604.86 --> 613.17
owls and bats little birdies big insects

617.17 --> 622.26
even with the zoom on a peanut what

625.119 --> 631.359
I don't think zoom is gonna help a lot

627.249 --> 633.659
with that at a meeting it was very close

631.359 --> 633.659
by

640.4 --> 643.8199999999999
hey Brendon

650.68 --> 653.309
tell

654.25 --> 661.27
okay Essie I guess Essie was pointing at

658.63 --> 665.04
some kind of another detail that wasn't

661.27 --> 668.71
accounted for in the moon landing

665.04 --> 670.6899999999999
situation I'm I'm not so much about the

668.71 --> 672.46
details about that whole thing you know

670.69 --> 674.83
it's always interesting to kind of look

672.46 --> 678.4300000000001
into it if it's if I happen to bump into

674.83 --> 682.45
it but I'm not really obsessed about the

678.43 --> 684.31
whole moon landing situation and exactly

682.45 --> 689.1
in every detail and how was wrong

684.31 --> 691.75
because yeah I've kind of seen enough

689.1 --> 694.09
you know it's kind of like 9/11 you

691.75 --> 698.56
could go on endlessly about the details

694.09 --> 700.8000000000001
and different type of angles and but yes

698.56 --> 702.6099999999999
you know at some point you just got to

700.8 --> 707.62
kind of let it go

702.61 --> 715.15
or it'll distract you from seeing other

707.62 --> 719.8
things mm-hmm world's biggest be African

715.15 --> 723.9399999999999
bees are small three-inch be a joke oh

719.8 --> 728.3199999999999
maybe new speed okay interesting guns

723.94 --> 732.4200000000001
whenever on well its biggest be you know

728.32 --> 732.4200000000001
what I'll check it out who knows maybe

734.49 --> 740.539
maybe it's exactly alike

737.44 --> 740.5390000000001
[Applause]

746.42 --> 749.42
right

753.47 --> 765.1
yeah with a very big head almost like a

758.66 --> 765.1
beetle this class I think it was that

767.17 --> 772.0699999999999
but it had it like the picture that I'm

770.15 --> 774.0799999999999
seeing right now just from looking at

772.07 --> 777.59
the youtube search results on world's

774.08 --> 780.2900000000001
biggest V the one that I'm seeing is a

777.59 --> 784.0400000000001
lot darker this one did have a lot of

780.29 --> 794.41
yellow in his back the picture here does

784.04 --> 794.41
not on the other

796.97 --> 807.9200000000001
I don't know maybe could it have been a

804.14 --> 810.16
giant Hornet maybe it didn't seem like

807.92 --> 810.16
one

820.4 --> 826.01
all right the first video by the way

822.81 --> 829.26
shows a guy that has one in it in a tube

826.01 --> 834.51
or looking at the size of that yeah

829.26 --> 838.53
that's exactly how big it was what I saw

834.51 --> 843.11
so I really think it was that one and it

838.53 --> 844.3199999999999
did have like the claw very standing out

843.11 --> 849.92
manacles

844.32 --> 849.9200000000001
it is hmm

880.0 --> 885.879
okay you're all [ __ ] I don't know what

882.639 --> 891.04
that means exactly what you did but if

885.879 --> 893.62
you find some kind of good way to and to

891.04 --> 897.209
get the really good videos together and

893.62 --> 897.2090000000001
out in the open that's interesting

907.77 --> 910.89
[Music]

912.05 --> 915.3499999999999
okay where

930.77 --> 933.52
right

934.08 --> 944.6700000000001
well the Asian giant Hornet seen

937.86 --> 948.9300000000001
pictures of it that yeah that absolutely

944.67 --> 953.03
looks like a wasp you know and this

948.93 --> 958.26
creature didn't he didn't have the the

953.03 --> 961.23
typical yeah claw like where its bending

958.26 --> 964.98
its ass backward distinguish it

961.23 --> 967.86
that's how wasps will typically hang

964.98 --> 969.99
around also or just they have this

967.86 --> 972.87
reflex a lot where they do this with

969.99 --> 979.58
their sting this one was just hanging

972.87 --> 979.58
pretty straight so much more like a bee

981.02 --> 990.02
bees yeah I definitely don't think it

987.09 --> 990.02
was an Asian Hornet

1003.29 --> 1006.0699999999999
mm-hm

1008.2 --> 1014.13
jørn Utzon West are closely related

1010.27 --> 1014.13
above sure

1026.119 --> 1029.2189999999998
[Music]

1032.619 --> 1035.6689999999999
[Music]

1037.67 --> 1047.68
yeah anyone out there if you're afraid

1041.57 --> 1050.0
of bugs you know then befriend the birds

1047.68 --> 1053.8400000000001
now if you're gonna befriend the birds

1050.0 --> 1057.02
you're gonna be careful yeah and if you

1053.84 --> 1059.0
like have fruits or berries then they're

1057.02 --> 1060.34
probably gonna take their toll or that

1059.0 --> 1063.26
as well

1060.34 --> 1065.8999999999999
but having a lot of birds around and

1063.26 --> 1069.32
like giving them like a little safe

1065.9 --> 1076.3100000000002
space kind of garden or whatever they

1069.32 --> 1078.71
take care of bugs a lot so that would be

1076.31 --> 1081.9099999999999
my advice don't don't be afraid of bugs

1078.71 --> 1081.91
just befriend birds

1101.88 --> 1108.3600000000001
spaceforce movie a comedy cheese

1123.039 --> 1130.69
right Guns of Navarone R&P well that's

1126.2 --> 1134.059
kind of mine yeah well you know there's

1130.69 --> 1136.249
like everything has had is part of a

1134.059 --> 1137.99
food chain and you can use that to your

1136.249 --> 1142.58
advantage now

1137.99 --> 1143.96
I kind of like birds although yeah I

1142.58 --> 1146.269
also kind of like bats but especially

1143.96 --> 1149.509
because they go after mosquitoes but I

1146.269 --> 1152.72
also like cats so because of that I

1149.509 --> 1160.7
always have to be like get in between

1152.72 --> 1167.3600000000001
cats and birds like protect the birds

1160.7 --> 1172.97
from the cat but other than that yeah I

1167.36 --> 1175.119
don't know where when there's a lot of

1172.97 --> 1179.8600000000001
birds around there's really things like

1175.119 --> 1179.86
wasp plagues or that kind of thing

1183.159 --> 1186.159
Bellamy

1191.38 --> 1201.22
now I'm definitely done with him in my

1197.779 --> 1201.22
chat thank you very much

1203.83 --> 1210.74
you know he even tried to yeah he tried

1208.7 --> 1212.809
to get a gravel out of it again

1210.74 --> 1214.46
he does it with every fricking thing he

1212.809 --> 1217.25
does all right

1214.46 --> 1219.74
telling me oh that that wasn't real me

1217.25 --> 1222.44
in chat it wasn't a real way that was

1219.74 --> 1225.74
like that but because you were like this

1222.44 --> 1227.75
I'm not gonna come back trying to make

1225.74 --> 1232.07
me kind of feel guilty and stupid again

1227.75 --> 1234.679
like like it matters like it matters if

1232.07 --> 1238.309
it was literally him or a sock playing

1234.679 --> 1241.0900000000001
him it's people that like him it's yeah

1238.309 --> 1241.09
he's not helping

1250.85 --> 1254.01
[Music]

1275.71 --> 1285.32
all right also by the way interesting

1280.1 --> 1287.9599999999998
detail if that was really his sock

1285.32 --> 1292.28
supposedly that acted like that on the

1287.96 --> 1294.56
show yesterday and I bent right well

1292.28 --> 1297.41
then if it wasn't him that means that

1294.56 --> 1303.52
he's still not banned unless somebody

1297.41 --> 1303.52
else took over his real account right so

1304.09 --> 1307.09
yeah

1309.63 --> 1316.92
just saying that like this guy what I

1313.38 --> 1320.73
said yesterday even to Tony about the

1316.92 --> 1324.3000000000002
whole situation that was so on target so

1320.73 --> 1328.73
much that yeah he's just moved on to me

1324.3 --> 1332.61
now to try I said oh no that wasn't me

1328.73 --> 1334.95
so he's constantly sowing confusion and

1332.61 --> 1336.6899999999998
trying to put people up against one

1334.95 --> 1346.3400000000001
another in some way now is a complete

1336.69 --> 1346.3400000000001
and utter grab blur exactly what they do

1359.86 --> 1363.7299999999998
right thank you get it

1366.15 --> 1369.239
[Music]

1387.57 --> 1399.98
um I won't ever hurt him Walter Russell

1391.74 --> 1413.4
yeah sure and he said he doesn t know

1399.98 --> 1415.17
your name is was it Neal all right you

1413.4 --> 1420.5700000000002
know technically you could just use the

1415.17 --> 1424.71
same email and make another account with

1420.57 --> 1426.81
it in Google called Neal Cosentino with

1424.71 --> 1430.55
your own picture if you like to or

1426.81 --> 1430.55
another picture or the same picture

1436.97 --> 1452.21
just the tip you could do that shouldn't

1441.799 --> 1453.71
be too difficult to do that anyway yeah

1452.21 --> 1456.679
what do you guys have been up to

1453.71 --> 1465.47
yesterday I as I said I went to bed very

1456.679 --> 1467.3790000000001
early get to watch some awesome Owen

1465.47 --> 1473.96
Benjamin again like the guys always

1467.379 --> 1477.9189999999999
bringing out crushing stuff and I didn't

1473.96 --> 1480.979
even see the entirety of it but I did

1477.919 --> 1484.429
get to finish seeing it through [ __ ]

1480.979 --> 1489.669
shoot and he played this amazing video

1484.429 --> 1492.8590000000002
that really with CGI put down

1489.669 --> 1496.009
yeah the dichotomy between the virus

1492.859 --> 1502.269
theory and the the alternative to the

1496.009 --> 1506.269
field was it field theory or vironment

1502.269 --> 1508.639
theory anyway and basically described

1506.269 --> 1510.83
with visuals in detail the differences

1508.639 --> 1514.07
and all that made wide compare it was

1510.83 --> 1517.22
fantastic video I wish I knew exactly

1514.07 --> 1522.08
which video that was so I could

1517.22 --> 1525.46
literally link it up I've only seen it

1522.08 --> 1525.46
through Owen Benjamin's video

1551.47 --> 1559.539
yep I'm just gonna link up until the

1554.35 --> 1561.99
moment where the video starts writes 15

1559.539 --> 1561.99
minute

1570.9 --> 1583.02
yeah 50 minute and 21 seconds

1574.33 --> 1588.82
or yeah that D two hours 15 minutes and

1583.02 --> 1593.02
21 seconds mark he starts that video

1588.82 --> 1601.77
with some funny commentary by the way so

1593.02 --> 1601.77
and that's from episode 8 27

1602.07 --> 1607.1689999999999
it's a caps title but I'm putting no way

1605.14 --> 1610.3600000000001
it's not a cap side here this is a title

1607.169 --> 1614.3500000000001
over at [ __ ] shoot and then you'll know

1610.36 --> 1616.9599999999998
exactly which video I mean it would be

1614.35 --> 1618.58
nice if somebody couldn't recognize that

1616.96 --> 1622.39
video if they saw it somewhere before

1618.58 --> 1625.53
and point me to the original that would

1622.39 --> 1625.5300000000002
be really great

1650.8 --> 1658.6299999999999
hmm yeah you too yeah well look no

1655.81 --> 1663.25
gravity situation is not over yet you

1658.63 --> 1666.8200000000002
know how long is that stuffing going now

1663.25 --> 1669.25
I I didn't call gravity and aberration

1666.82 --> 1673.6299999999999
for nothing cuz it's not something

1669.25 --> 1677.62
you're gonna get rid of so easy it's if

1673.63 --> 1680.41
you want to move past at all then you

1677.62 --> 1686.9399999999998
will face the aberration and its tricks

1680.41 --> 1689.53
and the toughness of it you will face it

1686.94 --> 1690.55
like doesn't matter if you're a flat

1689.53 --> 1693.61
earther or a baller

1690.55 --> 1696.52
you're gonna face what it is and how to

1693.61 --> 1698.7099999999998
suggest that if it is and and then

1696.52 --> 1702.28
you're either going to reject the entire

1698.71 --> 1705.28
notion of scientific validity rejecting

1702.28 --> 1707.68
a scientific method and then just say no

1705.28 --> 1709.69
you don't need proof it's there because

1707.68 --> 1711.3100000000002
everything points at it being there

1709.69 --> 1714.1000000000001
exactly like the model even though I

1711.31 --> 1718.32
can't physically prove it then you're

1714.1 --> 1718.32
embracing the aberration as reality and

1718.44 --> 1725.3500000000001
yeah that happens among flat-earthers

1720.76 --> 1727.99
too in their own way it has been like

1725.35 --> 1730.4399999999998
for a long time for a very very long

1727.99 --> 1730.44
time

1731.67 --> 1739.41
and yeah when you start to figure out

1735.16 --> 1741.91
the relative density system then

1739.41 --> 1744.1000000000001
eventually when you really get a good

1741.91 --> 1748.42
grasp with it it's kind of important to

1744.1 --> 1751.57
then look at the conceptualization of

1748.42 --> 1754.66
gravity the originates from the roots of

1751.57 --> 1760.03
it little G and actually recognize it

1754.66 --> 1764.64
for what it is it's a it's a frame it's

1760.03 --> 1764.6399999999999
a formula to even out

1767.08 --> 1774.6589999999999
yeah even out the forces in a sense yet

1771.429 --> 1777.3400000000001
to even it out even yeah but it is a

1774.659 --> 1780.94
conceptual evening out it is basically

1777.34 --> 1784.149
to set the setting in the calculations

1780.94 --> 1785.769
and all that but no physical proof for

1784.149 --> 1790.32
it because just because you can

1785.769 --> 1790.32
calculate it doesn't mean ying is there

1792.029 --> 1796.6
that's really what it comes down to it's

1795.039 --> 1798.639
a problem with aberrations it's just so

1796.6 --> 1804.1589999999999
suggestive like but yeah but why the

1798.639 --> 1807.399
alignment wide why up and down right

1804.159 --> 1810.5700000000002
yeah and there is no answer for it and

1807.399 --> 1814.2689999999998
and I thought that Nathan and the panel

1810.57 --> 1815.799
went into that at my absence in an

1814.269 --> 1817.779
interesting way basically explaining

1815.799 --> 1820.389
it's part of natural law that's the way

1817.779 --> 1824.32
it is divided it's kind of my response I

1820.389 --> 1826.4189999999999
haven't even researched further into

1824.32 --> 1830.4089999999999
that it's just that my intuition says

1826.419 --> 1834.3090000000002
like no this is the way it is and to

1830.409 --> 1838.0490000000002
start to assume that you can find a

1834.309 --> 1842.08
reason as to why it's divided that way

1838.049 --> 1845.23
then yeah you unless you can actually

1842.08 --> 1846.999
prove it physically then you start to

1845.23 --> 1850.989
wander off into presupposition or

1846.999 --> 1855.549
fantasy ground it's part of the

1850.989 --> 1860.1390000000001
aberration so it's basically the why why

1855.549 --> 1862.149
why why why until you can answer it

1860.139 --> 1864.7589999999998
anymore why and just have to say no this

1862.149 --> 1871.2689999999998
is just the way it is until further

1864.759 --> 1873.8990000000001
notice and this is why I really think it

1871.269 --> 1876.94
comes down to that it's that mechanism

1873.899 --> 1879.399
where the where little kids first become

1876.94 --> 1884.0800000000002
really curious and want to answer why

1879.399 --> 1889.6589999999999
why why every on everything that impulse

1884.08 --> 1893.019
and then we have this notion slit in

1889.659 --> 1895.749
culturally that there should be an

1893.019 --> 1898.929
answer to absolutely everything that

1895.749 --> 1899.71
there is no limit to the whys that can

1898.929 --> 1903.43
be

1899.71 --> 1908.08
and that is kind of delusional it's

1903.43 --> 1910.96
arrogant and it gets filled up with

1908.08 --> 1912.97
illusions that become assumed as being

1910.96 --> 1916.69
real even though they're out of your

1912.97 --> 1919.42
grasp and most of its presupposition

1916.69 --> 1923.25
lead theoretical so you're basically

1919.42 --> 1926.17
taking the illusion as truth when you

1923.25 --> 1930.34
think it's so you think it's necessary

1926.17 --> 1932.74
to know everything to have an answer to

1930.34 --> 1937.12
absolutely everything even though you

1932.74 --> 1941.95
can test it any more at some point yeah

1937.12 --> 1944.56
that's what happens so you're going to

1941.95 --> 1947.07
be very careful with that and now yeah

1944.56 --> 1950.3799999999999
don't lay claim of reality on

1947.07 --> 1954.51
presuppositional concepts it's unhealthy

1950.38 --> 1954.5100000000002
to do that

1975.53 --> 1979.78
Yeah right YouTube

1983.84 --> 1989.8999999999999
yeah and it is kind of silly in my

1986.24 --> 1993.92
opinion too because yeah if it's

1989.9 --> 1995.45
literally this ball lamp hanging 3000

1993.92 --> 1998.8400000000001
miles over yeah it would absolutely

1995.45 --> 2001.1200000000001
shine on to everything on the earth like

1998.84 --> 2006.52
what would it make out of go out of

2001.12 --> 2010.1499999999999
sight at any point if it is literally as

2006.52 --> 2012.94
is you know literally 3000 miles over

2010.15 --> 2014.3500000000001
that literal disc that doesn't make any

2012.94 --> 2020.17
sense to me either and that's why I

2014.35 --> 2023.83
think it's not like that at all I've

2020.17 --> 2026.53
stepped away from the notion that the

2023.83 --> 2030.54
Sun must be a literal lamp

2026.53 --> 2034.09
object from which the sunlight emanates

2030.54 --> 2036.25
spatially within the realm I think it is

2034.09 --> 2039.4599999999998
more a light manifestation that comes

2036.25 --> 2041.83
with the natural electricity of this

2039.46 --> 2042.39
realm it's just it manifests as part of

2041.83 --> 2048.64
the design

2042.39 --> 2056.35
it just emanates yeah in a angular

2048.64 --> 2058.21
orientation so there is a virtual point

2056.35 --> 2060.61
from which the light comes every time

2058.21 --> 2062.5
and when you change your position so

2060.61 --> 2067.27
does the virtual point from which the

2062.5 --> 2072.34
light comes in relation but it's always

2067.27 --> 2076.12
a virtual point that's basically the

2072.34 --> 2082.3900000000003
foundation of my model for the heavenly

2076.12 --> 2085.45
bodies now hey I've left I've put out

2082.39 --> 2089.19
there very carefully that yeah this is a

2085.45 --> 2092.89
concept a model that can be disproven

2089.19 --> 2096.1
right that's essential like if you can't

2092.89 --> 2098.8599999999997
disprove it then it's not really viable

2096.1 --> 2102.8199999999997
well you can and that is by proving a

2098.86 --> 2105.9700000000003
proximity to any of the heavenly bodies

2102.82 --> 2111.54
an actual approach angular size change

2105.97 --> 2115.81
due to proximity right the moon the sun

2111.54 --> 2117.07
proof that you can literally get closer

2115.81 --> 2121.21
to it

2117.07 --> 2123.9100000000003
that without changing the the camera

2121.21 --> 2129.75
zoom angle you approach it and you

2123.91 --> 2134.3999999999996
literally just see it like like that

2129.75 --> 2137.26
okay that's at least a sign of proximity

2134.4 --> 2139.42
something that you could deduce some

2137.26 --> 2142.9900000000002
kind of proximity from it for a starter

2139.42 --> 2145.75
you know I haven't even seen that so why

2142.99 --> 2147.33
would I ever go with some kind of

2145.75 --> 2150.22
presuppositional

2147.33 --> 2151.9
that there is any proximity to any of it

2150.22 --> 2155.62
when ever haven't even seen a single

2151.9 --> 2158.31
sign of approachability to any of the

2155.62 --> 2158.31
heavenly bodies

2163.65 --> 2177.4900000000002
what's that Missouri bear oh really

2169.12 --> 2181.12
you got oh wow you found it thank you so

2177.49 --> 2184.5299999999997
much thank you so much Missouri bear

2181.12 --> 2186.94
that's fantastic yeah that's the video I

2184.53 --> 2191.5
really appreciate that that you need

2186.94 --> 2197.71
that thank you so much I am gonna watch

2191.5 --> 2202.84
that video back it's one to spread yeah

2197.71 --> 2206.58
I'll also post it around in in the early

2202.84 --> 2206.58
bird chat so really good for you

2209.81 --> 2218.23
also put it in the cove it jet if it

2215.27 --> 2218.23
rises in there also

2224.96 --> 2228.9
yeah

2226.95 --> 2231.7999999999997
can always count on bears to crush

2228.9 --> 2231.8
that's right

2245.3 --> 2248.889
[Music]

2251.29 --> 2258.169
[Music]

2269.93 --> 2282.02
platon youtuber what what what do you

2275.24 --> 2284.9199999999996
mean so you mean to say that if you

2282.02 --> 2287.48
install the tracking app on your phone

2284.92 --> 2297.5
then you become targeted by the police

2287.48 --> 2300.79
and drag your house that is yeah that

2297.5 --> 2300.79
makes no sense actually

2321.78 --> 2327.6600000000003
what and there's this you want to know

2324.48 --> 2330.0
that that's not too difficult because

2327.66 --> 2332.0699999999997
when they're riding horses they're

2330.0 --> 2334.23
sitting very high okay

2332.07 --> 2338.13
you got to realize that that in a in a

2334.23 --> 2339.69
car your viewer height is actually not

2338.13 --> 2341.9700000000003
that high compared to just walking

2339.69 --> 2344.13
people but on a horse you become

2341.97 --> 2346.79
extremely tall effectively so you can

2344.13 --> 2350.2200000000003
see everywhere this also has a natural

2346.79 --> 2355.91
Authority domination kind of feel effect

2350.22 --> 2360.2999999999997
to it so it is effective for is it

2355.91 --> 2364.7
preventative crowd control theatrics

2360.3 --> 2368.13
Falls yeah it's very old method very old

2364.7 --> 2371.1899999999996
horses because the horses do that

2368.13 --> 2373.55
sitting on horses if you know what

2371.19 --> 2373.55
you're doing

2384.74 --> 2393.12
yeah remember for example Napoleon was

2389.58 --> 2395.97
almost always sitting on a horse in the

2393.12 --> 2397.65
presence of troops and all that why

2395.97 --> 2400.2799999999997
would that be well because he was a very

2397.65 --> 2405.83
tiny guy and he needed the extra height

2400.28 --> 2405.8300000000004
so he would usually sit on a horse

2427.5 --> 2430.19
what

2431.41 --> 2434.67
what are you talking about

2444.49 --> 2453.04
come on Missouri bear you know that that

2448.21 --> 2454.9
is tiny by big bear standards but but no

2453.04 --> 2462.4
he was actually much smaller than that I

2454.9 --> 2465.3
think I think he was like 5 foot I don't

2462.4 --> 2465.3
know where you're getting that from

2471.6 --> 2480.5499999999997
yeah yeah I get it it's like this it's a

2477.01 --> 2481.86
running joke from Big Bear look I'm five

2480.55 --> 2487.1800000000003
foot seven

2481.86 --> 2492.27
so I'm tiny by big bear standards

2487.18 --> 2492.27
I'm not big enough to be trusted right

2494.67 --> 2501.16
but I'm pretty sure that Napoleon was

2497.32 --> 2502.6000000000004
really tiny 20 Rogen's is five foot

2501.16 --> 2505.47
seven good to know thanks for that I

2502.6 --> 2505.47
didn't know that yet

2524.97 --> 2528.4199999999996
that's a lot

2544.53 --> 2555.7200000000003
okay Allenby I'd like to hear from you

2548.1 --> 2558.69
how how many Rogen's are you tall yeah I

2555.72 --> 2560.8799999999997
know you're not gonna show us how you

2558.69 --> 2564.92
really look but at least you could give

2560.88 --> 2564.92
us your height in arobin's

2578.11 --> 2589.4700000000003
whoa serious concept Navarone your that

2581.35 --> 2589.47
large down that's pretty big

2593.34 --> 2596.9700000000003
hey Amanda young

2613.5 --> 2617.45
how do you know that mark colored

2624.089 --> 2626.839
rank

2642.97 --> 2651.31
I know I've always considered myself to

2647.29 --> 2653.849
be like an ultimate midsize I'm like

2651.31 --> 2653.849
midsize

2676.15 --> 2679.9500000000003
Oh five-foot-six

2682.8 --> 2690.0
all right five foot one but it doesn't

2688.71 --> 2694.62
really matter you know it's all about

2690.0 --> 2697.41
the character you know so this is how it

2694.62 --> 2700.23
kind of works there's like consequences

2697.41 --> 2704.16
of your height socially and you're gonna

2700.23 --> 2707.52
adapt one way or the other it always

2704.16 --> 2709.44
happens well and there's a division like

2707.52 --> 2712.23
with males and females too as like

2709.44 --> 2715.53
different strategies and when you're a

2712.23 --> 2720.81
small guy you're going to be more

2715.53 --> 2722.46
likable more sociable or exactly the

2720.81 --> 2725.0099999999998
opposite this

2722.46 --> 2727.95
I know I've always noticed that just

2725.01 --> 2729.7200000000003
small people especially guys just always

2727.95 --> 2733.0499999999997
have a lot of energy and they they can

2729.72 --> 2735.5899999999997
either use it for good or just to get in

2733.05 --> 2735.59
everybody's way

2740.33 --> 2750.2599999999998
but I don't know maybe that is different

2744.8 --> 2753.3700000000003
for of Asian descent because they don't

2750.26 --> 2753.3700000000003
do that so much

2762.46 --> 2765.569
short man syndrome

2771.89 --> 2777.819
all right

2773.99 --> 2779.839
and it's so it's really kind of

2777.819 --> 2781.339
confrontational for somebody when they

2779.839 --> 2783.5
realize they're really short and then

2781.339 --> 2788.72
they really only have two choices you

2783.5 --> 2790.579
know did there's no other way and if you

2788.72 --> 2793.8999999999996
don't accept that then it's great

2790.579 --> 2796.28
likelihood you end up in the one way

2793.9 --> 2799.069
being very complainy and

2796.28 --> 2806.4500000000003
attention-grabbing and restless and [ __ ]

2799.069 --> 2810.67
and dissatisfied that kind of [ __ ] but

2806.45 --> 2815.4199999999996
if you can just accept it then yeah

2810.67 --> 2818.63
small guys that are Jed they yeah they

2815.42 --> 2821.48
become mighty as own Benjamin says it

2818.63 --> 2827.119
you know the smallest of guys can be

2821.48 --> 2828.92
mighty but it's a big challenge to get

2827.119 --> 2835.4
there

2828.92 --> 2843.67
I hate [ __ ] Wow now come on their own

2835.4 --> 2843.67
a plane it's a little bit too far maybe

2845.29 --> 2852.16
but yeah the the complainy types yeah

2848.9 --> 2852.1600000000003
very annoying

2862.36 --> 2865.59
all righty then

2889.48 --> 2892.2
hmm

2926.25 --> 2929.309
[Music]

2935.42 --> 2940.55
it must be the spring heat

2959.39 --> 2962.9
Snowden what

2974.4 --> 2982.2090000000003
shorter men survived longer in combat

2977.969 --> 2986.579
well if that's a big if though if they

2982.209 --> 2993.5989999999997
can prevent from getting cataclysmically

2986.579 --> 2993.599
struck that's pretty much it yes

2998.809 --> 3003.6690000000003
because the smaller you are technically

3001.209 --> 3006.1189999999997
the more fragile you become if you can't

3003.669 --> 3006.1189999999997
evade

3014.69 --> 3019.119
[Music]

3028.26 --> 3036.0600000000004
chod that's not true Dale I Ohio of

3030.99 --> 3041.0699999999997
course they care no not literally but

3036.06 --> 3048.71
yeah if you're small there's less what

3041.07 --> 3052.26
is it there's less angular size for you

3048.71 --> 3054.15
angular size space for you to hit so

3052.26 --> 3066.1800000000003
being small has an advantage when it

3054.15 --> 3069.27
comes to bullets it's just a fact one

3066.18 --> 3073.29
could say that when the bullet that the

3069.27 --> 3076.23
gun was introduced not the cat well even

3073.29 --> 3079.2799999999997
with the cannon also you know already

3076.23 --> 3081.06
with the first projectiles when they

3079.28 --> 3085.19
were introduced

3081.06 --> 3087.99
that's when being extremely large

3085.19 --> 3091.7000000000003
started to become a disadvantage all of

3087.99 --> 3095.85
a sudden because yeah even with bows and

3091.7 --> 3097.56
ballistas and all that if you were large

3095.85 --> 3100.02
you would still have a much better

3097.56 --> 3103.0499999999997
chance if you got struck - I don't know

3100.02 --> 3106.55
pull it out survive for a while

3103.05 --> 3108.51
well with a bullet the impact is just

3106.55 --> 3112.8900000000003
usually always got to be catastrophic

3108.51 --> 3115.619
and being large makes you more of a

3112.89 --> 3120.18
target so that really changed everything

3115.619 --> 3122.4900000000002
around when before the larger you were

3120.18 --> 3125.46
the more imposing the more intimidating

3122.49 --> 3130.2299999999996
and the more power you had behind weapon

3125.46 --> 3132.54
strikes making you much more effective

3130.23 --> 3136.35
instantly against another foe of smaller

3132.54 --> 3139.31
size so yeah the bullet completely

3136.35 --> 3139.31
changed the game at it

3146.86 --> 3149.86
what

3157.56 --> 3161.7799999999997
you mean like tunneling Gideon's second

3163.28 --> 3181.3500000000004
oh my sorry bear that sounds like

3176.67 --> 3188.04
Einstein you're talking about now he did

3181.35 --> 3193.08
that right away your wife's cousin about

3188.04 --> 3196.47
his wives it's not likely

3193.08 --> 3200.58
Einstein did that married to your wife's

3196.47 --> 3203.66
cousin that would be odd since he is

3200.58 --> 3205.98
extremely dead for a long time I

3203.66 --> 3210.14
remember correctly his brain was even

3205.98 --> 3210.14
donated to some university in a jar

3210.38 --> 3214.949
[Music]

3240.8 --> 3243.8590000000004
[Music]

3250.27 --> 3253.08
right

3253.28 --> 3256.8500000000004
yeah Guns of Navarone well it's all

3255.17 --> 3262.69
about the quickness and are they sharp

3256.85 --> 3262.69
of mind it's very important you know the

3262.75 --> 3268.88
quickness helps a lot

3265.55 --> 3271.79
it also helps a lot if they're good at

3268.88 --> 3274.58
it I don't know to be an assistant to

3271.79 --> 3276.92
somebody you know that'll be like active

3274.58 --> 3279.74
in engaging in diplomacy or whatever

3276.92 --> 3285.11
some action and they can be quick to

3279.74 --> 3290.6
pick up [ __ ] going down if they're clear

3285.11 --> 3292.85
minded I don't know this is kind of what

3290.6 --> 3296.71
my role has been a lot that's the kind

3292.85 --> 3303.02
of the role I took on when I was younger

3296.71 --> 3305.0
cuz I don't know why but I've been

3303.02 --> 3310.12
around people that are taller than me

3305.0 --> 3314.03
most of my childhood like an teens I

3310.12 --> 3316.8399999999997
don't know why what a lot of people were

3314.03 --> 3316.84
taller than me

3336.76 --> 3344.01
most people go for the big guy first all

3341.95 --> 3344.0099999999998
right

3354.4 --> 3363.1600000000003
yeah and if a big guy in a group is

3357.43 --> 3369.31
aware of it and it's like trained they

3363.16 --> 3371.64
should know that should be aware if

3369.31 --> 3375.67
there's going to be some kind of

3371.64 --> 3380.2799999999997
contraction that they might be targeted

3375.67 --> 3380.28
as an example anyway

3406.309 --> 3409.029
hmm

3420.65 --> 3428.839
hmm okay getting sick anyway you're

3426.17 --> 3430.73
influenced by Big Bear perspective I

3428.839 --> 3434.8289999999997
think it's a lot of big talk nothing

3430.73 --> 3434.829
more of what what do you mean

3445.88 --> 3452.739
no more colored I haven't watched the

3448.069 --> 3452.739
fights I don't watch fights

3475.36 --> 3480.61
they're getting sick I don't know if you

3478.07 --> 3483.71
were talking to Missouri bear or to me

3480.61 --> 3490.09
but I can say I'm definitely influenced

3483.71 --> 3490.09
by Big Bear talk and not really bluster

3493.539 --> 3503.0190000000002
although yeah it's like this it's in a

3499.119 --> 3505.539
way things are being exaggerated to be

3503.019 --> 3509.0789999999997
lifted out and exposed in a way and it's

3505.539 --> 3510.759
like people's shame are maybe against

3509.079 --> 3513.819
their will just being put on the table

3510.759 --> 3516.729
for them to look at and get a little

3513.819 --> 3519.869
extra harsh on it to remind them yeah

3516.729 --> 3519.8689999999997
you have to deal with that

3527.89 --> 3534.519
yeah look at all the fruits no that's

3529.989 --> 3536.579
right all creation berry yeah I own

3534.519 --> 3538.839
Benjamin has put some really good

3536.579 --> 3541.029
suggestions and information out there

3538.839 --> 3544.95
and has spread along things you know eat

3541.029 --> 3548.289
come on he's even on to Flat Earth guys

3544.95 --> 3550.39
don't forget about that you know you're

3548.289 --> 3553.65
not maybe you're taking it for granted

3550.39 --> 3557.89
or something but that was a huge step

3553.65 --> 3559.9300000000003
okay and he didn't back down word that

3557.89 --> 3567.21
kind of nonsense okay no he is with it

3559.93 --> 3573.7889999999998
he gets it so that's one thing and

3567.21 --> 3577.809
beside that I don't know he's just he's

3573.789 --> 3581.98
like be the bard like he says it's like

3577.809 --> 3584.3190000000004
a spiritual function he's a comedian he

3581.98 --> 3593.14
brings people together and try to

3584.319 --> 3597.279
emphasize the good things like part of

3593.14 --> 3601.8089999999997
the yeah in classical Greek terms about

3597.279 --> 3607.63
a part of the of the farmers and of the

3601.809 --> 3614.1090000000004
the fruits of nature and living right

3607.63 --> 3616.739
and sensible and peaceful and added

3614.109 --> 3620.799
definitely of Christ because that is

3616.739 --> 3622.079
from another tradition kind of the same

3620.799 --> 3627.22
thing

3622.079 --> 3630.7490000000003
see it's solve it's about the frequency

3627.22 --> 3635.6499999999996
and I think own Benjamin does great and

3630.749 --> 3636.8489999999997
he's he's like risque and for real not

3635.65 --> 3640.1800000000003
just like Oh

3636.849 --> 3646.779
pretentious risk you know who he takes

3640.18 --> 3648.19
risks persistently and proudly and I

3646.779 --> 3652.869
don't know where he gets all his energy

3648.19 --> 3656.0190000000002
man is just it that can't simply just be

3652.869 --> 3658.04
all logos but that has to be some

3656.019 --> 3662.97
special

3658.04 --> 3668.07
source days that's just him can't

3662.97 --> 3670.0499999999997
explain it and yeah I love it I love

3668.07 --> 3671.4300000000003
being around there and love commenting I

3670.05 --> 3674.369
can't comment right now because I don't

3671.43 --> 3677.31
have a membership you need to comment

3674.369 --> 3677.9100000000003
but don't mind just listening it's just

3677.31 --> 3681.93
great

3677.91 --> 3683.91
and so many things that I would want to

3681.93 --> 3697.44
say I see other people just saying it

3683.91 --> 3700.47
quickly after anyway what militarily

3697.44 --> 3702.54
what does that mean getting sick are you

3700.47 --> 3704.31
saying are you asking is his father in

3702.54 --> 3708.42
the military I don't think so I don't

3704.31 --> 3709.74
know by the way maybe he is there's only

3708.42 --> 3713.4900000000002
a few things that I know about his

3709.74 --> 3721.3489999999997
father that's he is into magician

3713.49 --> 3725.3999999999996
trickery and that he's very very gay at

3721.349 --> 3727.9500000000003
least that's what Big Bear says and yeah

3725.4 --> 3732.329
not happy about it and and that he's

3727.95 --> 3734.46
like yeah just done just terrible social

3732.329 --> 3738.21
things towards his mother and all that

3734.46 --> 3739.19
and did it's his I'm not gonna that's

3738.21 --> 3741.69
not my business

3739.19 --> 3744.119
that's all I pretty much heard about it

3741.69 --> 3746.369
I don't know if he was in the military

3744.119 --> 3752.599
might have said it some point I might

3746.369 --> 3752.599
have not picked up on it does it matter

3755.76 --> 3762.5400000000004
I went to Castle yeah that's right he

3758.07 --> 3766.76
brought that up the castles oh god yeah

3762.54 --> 3769.41
I wasn't - gift still in in two castles

3766.76 --> 3772.2000000000003
was I wanted to build castle with my

3769.41 --> 3778.5299999999997
with my axe this is as she wanted it to

3772.2 --> 3782.7
but it's kind of nonsense but yeah

3778.53 --> 3785.0890000000004
castles are are awesome if you know what

3782.7 --> 3785.089
you're doing

3786.079 --> 3789.92
and if you have the space

3800.4 --> 3806.009
yeah well you know what if you'd have

3803.579 --> 3808.71
sufficient budget and I'm talking about

3806.009 --> 3811.47
probably billions you could make such

3808.71 --> 3815.339
amazing things you could make like a

3811.47 --> 3817.049
giant castle potential palace complex

3815.339 --> 3819.72
you don't have to make it all luxurious

3817.049 --> 3824.15
if you don't want to make it too much

3819.72 --> 3830.009
like that with just entire integrated

3824.15 --> 3833.4900000000002
fisheries recycling plant and algae and

3830.009 --> 3838.759
all kinds of just a giant integrated

3833.49 --> 3838.7589999999996
system that could just produce

3845.849 --> 3852.329
yeah and then basically use the castle

3848.489 --> 3856.0190000000002
as the looker as the thing to suspend it

3852.329 --> 3859.92
always you can have like yeah

3856.019 --> 3863.43
hey if you're gonna have like a big high

3859.92 --> 3868.9990000000003
room you know that's like potentially

3863.43 --> 3874.3489999999997
three four levels high then why not have

3868.999 --> 3887.8489999999997
like yeah plants just up the wall and

3874.349 --> 3891.9
even yeah the options are unlimited but

3887.849 --> 3893.88
it costs huge amounts of money and once

3891.9 --> 3895.89
you ever attain that amount of money or

3893.88 --> 3897.719
gain access to that then it's very

3895.89 --> 3899.7889999999998
unlikely you'll still have the

3897.719 --> 3902.94
inspiration you can muster together to

3899.789 --> 3906.6600000000003
get a project that's actually worth the

3902.94 --> 3909.2290000000003
original idea you'll never manage it

3906.66 --> 3913.019
it'll always become something more

3909.229 --> 3917.0389999999998
fixated on money or efficiency or sale

3913.019 --> 3919.16
ability because that's what happens when

3917.039 --> 3921.42
you have access to huge amounts of money

3919.16 --> 3924.3289999999997
then the money is the only thing that

3921.42 --> 3932.16
eventually matters and real creativity

3924.329 --> 3935.2490000000003
just if it diffuses grass is always

3932.16 --> 3940.68
greener on the other side and that

3935.249 --> 3944.6899999999996
includes financially no huge pile of

3940.68 --> 3947.279
money may look very green if you have it

3944.69 --> 3950.969
it's not that green anymore you're just

3947.279 --> 3954.809
concerned with not losing it in some way

3950.969 --> 3957.15
not miss investing right funny how that

3954.809 --> 3959.9
works out right the grass being greener

3957.15 --> 3959.9
on the other side

3963.66 --> 3966.699

3976.099 --> 3980.579
mmm

3977.719 --> 3982.679
yeah Missouri bear yeah being a castle

3980.579 --> 3987.829
Lord is definitely a fantastical

3982.679 --> 3987.829
opportunity I know exactly what you mean

4003.3 --> 4007.23
the grass is always greener above the

4005.61 --> 4009.59
septic tank that's hilarious more

4007.23 --> 4009.59
colored

4029.01 --> 4035.7700000000004
[Music]

4030.6 --> 4039.0699999999997
hmm castles castles castles yeah

4035.77 --> 4041.34
castles and integrated multi-level

4039.07 --> 4044.56
orchards

4041.34 --> 4049.53
greeneries yeah how about just a

4044.56 --> 4052.68
freaking like gothic castle cathedral

4049.53 --> 4057.19
cathedral greenery it's just a giant

4052.68 --> 4061.14
integrated church building castle with

4057.19 --> 4065.88
orchards everywhere it's just like yeah

4061.14 --> 4069.0099999999998
technically it could be done but again

4065.88 --> 4072.1600000000003
how could you ever get the money and

4069.01 --> 4075.48
everything together without having lost

4072.16 --> 4075.48
the inspiration for it

4082.68 --> 4090.5099999999998
right well getting sick it would be to

4088.17 --> 4093.26
call it it's like the design of the

4090.51 --> 4095.9700000000003
church kind of thing like a gothic

4093.26 --> 4100.92
Church design and gothic remembers with

4095.97 --> 4107.63
a lot of windows a lot of glass and then

4100.92 --> 4110.82
use that design concept to build a giant

4107.63 --> 4114.81
archery three-dimensional archery out of

4110.82 --> 4120.63
it plants on the inside and the outside

4114.81 --> 4125.280000000001
and yeah with compartmentalized glass

4120.63 --> 4128.93
part see so many possibilities with I

4125.28 --> 4128.929999999999
kind of thinking it would look amazing

4132.43 --> 4135.619000000001
[Music]

4137.79 --> 4142.889
[Music]

4140.109 --> 4142.889
hmm

4143.2 --> 4148.849999999999
and it doesn't literally have to be a

4145.58 --> 4153.68
church it could just be using the same

4148.85 --> 4156.109
design concepts as a as a design yeah a

4153.68 --> 4162.859
design foundation for a thing it would

4156.109 --> 4167.05
be very beautiful doesn't literally have

4162.859 --> 4167.05
to be functional as a church

4174.609 --> 4183.7300000000005
although yeah who knows hey you can

4180.52 --> 4185.9490000000005
account for that if you want that to be

4183.73 --> 4190.619
part of of the building what it should

4185.949 --> 4190.619
be able to to do

4207.75 --> 4214.44
charge of our witness my god all right

4210.9 --> 4218.58
well you know I thought about a setup

4214.44 --> 4220.5599999999995
that maybe is less logos driven but it's

4218.58 --> 4224.239
not like dark or anything but I was

4220.56 --> 4224.2390000000005
thinking of like all men have like a

4225.23 --> 4231.629999999999
something in the direction of it like a

4228.78 --> 4236.61
castle with just a turn it into a giant

4231.63 --> 4242.28
orchard and like nature paradise with

4236.61 --> 4246.9
Gardens and really like breed bugs I get

4242.28 --> 4249.33
ya make sure that their bees can really

4246.9 --> 4252.629999999999
thrive there maybe even get into honey

4249.33 --> 4255.75
and just fish pools and natural filter

4252.63 --> 4257.91
it's just like yeah so many awesome

4255.75 --> 4259.98
things you could do with that and then

4257.91 --> 4262.5599999999995
on top of that or rather in the bottom

4259.98 --> 4265.679999999999
of that in the church the Church in the

4262.56 --> 4268.77
castle like thing I know I have a big

4265.68 --> 4270.719
basement not a dungeon but you can think

4268.77 --> 4275.070000000001
of it as a dungeon that you could use

4270.719 --> 4281.54
this like a party ground to really

4275.07 --> 4284.489
organize parties and like yeah how

4281.54 --> 4287.1
seriously back then I was thinking man

4284.489 --> 4289.709999999999
gothic parties in dungeons of actual

4287.1 --> 4292.7390000000005
castles with like organic food

4289.71 --> 4294.4800000000005
everywhere and yeah I wasn't thinking

4292.739 --> 4297.2699999999995
about creepy things I was just thinking

4294.48 --> 4301.86
about like awesome ultimate stylish

4297.27 --> 4304.89
parties really and yeah if it's in the

4301.86 --> 4309.9
ground they like literally in the ground

4304.89 --> 4314.04
of the castle then any sound yeah

4309.9 --> 4317.69
it wants really bother too many people

4314.04 --> 4320.43
far away either like it could be built

4317.69 --> 4322.589999999999
so that it'll absorb as much sound as

4320.43 --> 4324.66
can so you can really have bigger

4322.59 --> 4334.379
parties there and nobody else will be

4324.66 --> 4340.6089999999995
bothered by it but anyway

4334.379 --> 4340.6089999999995
yeah that was my idea like ten years ago

4341.599 --> 4346.039
no idea how to get there of course

4349.469 --> 4354.39
yeah and who knows man you could have

4351.48 --> 4355.739
like Raquin once you got a big place

4354.39 --> 4357.2390000000005
like that and you can use for all these

4355.739 --> 4359.699
kinds of things then yeah you could use

4357.239 --> 4362.099999999999
it as recording studios if you wanted to

4359.699 --> 4368.129999999999
you know give people the opportunity to

4362.1 --> 4372.71
make their own records and [ __ ] and so

4368.13 --> 4377.76
much you can do just giving the

4372.71 --> 4380.61
availability well yeah bring a lot of

4377.76 --> 4382.68
people out of the out of the shed out of

4380.61 --> 4384.75
their basement and just suddenly like oh

4382.68 --> 4388.5
wow I always wanted to do this but it

4384.75 --> 4391.44
just couldn't find the right moment the

4388.5 --> 4393.75
right place the right circle and yeah

4391.44 --> 4397.19
you give it you offer it and then

4393.75 --> 4397.19
suddenly they come out of the works

4404.469 --> 4410.2300000000005
and it's in a way it's funny because

4408.12 --> 4411.64
unexpectedly that's kind of what has

4410.23 --> 4413.86
happened with the whole YouTube

4411.64 --> 4415.18
situation and even with what I'm doing

4413.86 --> 4419.91
right here and the flat earth debates

4415.18 --> 4422.71
and everything we're giving this

4419.91 --> 4428.68
opportunity for people to learn along

4422.71 --> 4431.41
and climb out of the the artificially

4428.68 --> 4436.650000000001
created pit of ignorance of the official

4431.41 --> 4439.989
narrative and kind of helped to secure

4436.65 --> 4442.0
bridges on the higher level so they they

4439.989 --> 4447.009999999999
don't slip back so easily know all the

4442.0 --> 4448.63
tricks how to stay up but yeah ten years

4447.01 --> 4453.1900000000005
ago I never thought it would be like

4448.63 --> 4456.81
this so it just goes to show that I

4453.19 --> 4456.8099999999995
can't see everything coming

4479.4 --> 4489.24
it's okay getting sick yeah well there's

4486.15 --> 4491.429999999999
a lot of psychotropic stuff out there

4489.24 --> 4495.23
you know that have been used by witches

4491.43 --> 4501.150000000001
in pas and yeah you got to realize that

4495.23 --> 4504.419999999999
especially in the older days priests

4501.15 --> 4509.04
were often experimenting with

4504.42 --> 4516.45
psychotropics to try to find God to

4509.04 --> 4519.6
figure it out it's yeah there were

4516.45 --> 4521.82
priests engaging in that they were

4519.6 --> 4524.85
basically tripping and then trying to

4521.82 --> 4526.86
relay messages of God in their own way

4524.85 --> 4533.030000000001
you could yeah

4526.86 --> 4536.79
probably inspired in a way by the Bible

4533.03 --> 4539.21
but yeah doing it with the psychotropics

4536.79 --> 4539.21
knowledge

4552.23 --> 4555.879999999999
I don't know getting sick maybe

4560.349 --> 4577.81
I have no idea what you're talking about

4563.77 --> 4581.88
really why you bring this up but I I

4577.81 --> 4584.88
thought a tree is sacred

4581.88 --> 4584.88
okay

4589.75 --> 4595.83
you mean from the the pagan approach

4593.17 --> 4595.83
right

4597.22 --> 4604.109
[Music]

4619.059 --> 4626.610000000001
right yeah well I don't mind it's

4623.77 --> 4626.610000000001
nothing wrong with that

4635.81 --> 4638.9890000000005

4650.76 --> 4657.860000000001

4689.869 --> 4699.799999999999
you just having me on because I feel

4696.44 --> 4701.48
relatively laid-back as well it's so

4699.8 --> 4705.6990000000005
warm and I almost feel like just taking

4701.48 --> 4705.699
off my shirt man it's really one

4727.019 --> 4741.4490000000005
good to hear from you well thanks for

4730.23 --> 4757.079
letting me down there you go on a hike

4741.449 --> 4759.799999999999
interesting random explorer yeah thanks

4757.079 --> 4764.4
for Asian bear I'm alright

4759.8 --> 4771.329000000001
it's just a a chilled Sunday show and

4764.4 --> 4773.82
hey yesterday I was talking about god of

4771.329 --> 4779.159
Jesus Christ and creation like a lot so

4773.82 --> 4785.789
I don't know why that tends to flare up

4779.159 --> 4790.848999999999
on Saturday typically all right mark

4785.789 --> 4790.849
colored help you you're gonna be alright

4802.42 --> 4805.35
mm-hmm

4807.67 --> 4815.64
okay creation bear why's that that

4811.99 --> 4815.639999999999
doesn't sound very pleasant

4818.689 --> 4826.610000000001
hoping it's not the 5g well a you can

4823.159 --> 4829.999
laugh about it you know but yeah what

4826.61 --> 4831.978999999999
has been have towers being erected are

4829.999 --> 4836.09
there new transmitters you hadn't seen

4831.979 --> 4838.579000000001
before you know you should I do you

4836.09 --> 4841.999
should keep track of these types of

4838.579 --> 4845.119
things like I've noticed there is one

4841.999 --> 4847.789
sort of a transmitter like thing what it

4845.119 --> 4849.978999999999
seems to me more like a police check a

4847.789 --> 4851.659
relay thing I don't know what it is it's

4849.979 --> 4854.959
even a microphone I don't know what

4851.659 --> 4858.199
they're doing and it's way like a mile

4854.959 --> 4859.969
or two in that direction ground level so

4858.199 --> 4864.469
it's not like a tower that's high up or

4859.969 --> 4869.059
anything but yeah if there was any of

4864.469 --> 4872.439
the any transmitter tower inside I would

4869.059 --> 4872.439
definitely pick up on it

4886.13 --> 4895.37
all right you got yeah you told me the

4888.26 --> 4900.38
other day that you have Wi-Fi yeah go

4895.37 --> 4905.42
for the wires man get a laptop or a PC

4900.38 --> 4910.34
and just wire it you know you only have

4905.42 --> 4914.39
to buy the wire once and technically

4910.34 --> 4917.39
you'll never have to use or keep Wi-Fi

4914.39 --> 4922.160000000001
on on for any reason whatsoever after

4917.39 --> 4923.990000000001
that point unless you insists having

4922.16 --> 4926.26
Internet activities over your mobile

4923.99 --> 4926.26
phone

4943.09 --> 4945.78
hmm

4963.53 --> 4970.4
just thinking about it you know this

4965.869 --> 4974.21
whole wireless stuff that's been pushed

4970.4 --> 4976.94
through with the more modern mobiles and

4974.21 --> 4981.59
tablets and all that it's like oh it's

4976.94 --> 4987.469
oh so thin it's all Wireless so easy but

4981.59 --> 4992.389
yeah what if people or people like me

4987.469 --> 4994.729
are just saying no we want a wire option

4992.389 --> 4999.01
it's great if they for people who really

4994.729 --> 5002.38
want to bathe in like a thousand Wi-Fi

4999.01 --> 5005.070000000001
uploading streams all day long just like

5002.38 --> 5009.849
microwaves are delicious yeah go ahead

5005.07 --> 5012.07
but I I wouldn't want to be forced into

5009.849 --> 5014.8
that situation I don't want to be forced

5012.07 --> 5018.999
to use that convenience you know what I

5014.8 --> 5023.889
mean so why don't they just standardize

5018.999 --> 5026.499
an internet plug you know just one

5023.889 --> 5029.07
little corner just like click take it

5026.499 --> 5033.099
out whatever where you can just

5029.07 --> 5038.889
literally plug in a typical internet

5033.099 --> 5042.28
cable you know it doesn't yeah it might

5038.889 --> 5044.86
even not fit because it's too too wide

5042.28 --> 5048.61
well they can figure out a way to make

5044.86 --> 5051.13
it fit without yeah the thing the

5048.61 --> 5053.409
phone-- becoming clunky to bet you they

5051.13 --> 5055.539
figure out a system for that just half

5053.409 --> 5057.969
the freakin option like any of the

5055.539 --> 5060.159
tablets any mobile phone it's like oh

5057.969 --> 5070.329
you could have everything like just have

5060.159 --> 5073.329
the option click have the option just

5070.329 --> 5076.21
have the option so much trouble can be

5073.329 --> 5078.759999999999
bypassed with this nonsense lawsuits can

5076.21 --> 5083.249
be avoided in the future if you have

5078.76 --> 5083.249
this think about it

5091.55 --> 5094.629
[Music]

5098.5 --> 5112.27
[Music]

5105.179 --> 5114.849
you know people industrialists bankers

5112.27 --> 5121.4490000000005
if they don't want to listen to I don't

5114.849 --> 5123.46
know just basic reason medical reason

5121.449 --> 5124.869
medical reasons they don't want listen

5123.46 --> 5126.46
to that then maybe they'll listen to

5124.869 --> 5128.489
yeah you might want to do this or you're

5126.46 --> 5131.44
gonna get yeah

5128.489 --> 5134.259999999999
or you're gonna get a lot of lawsuits

5131.44 --> 5137.32
over time eventually you know so maybe

5134.26 --> 5140.17
that'll actually drive them to do some

5137.32 --> 5145.54
sensible action in this regard because

5140.17 --> 5148.21
I've been kind of well not super hanging

5145.54 --> 5149.98
on the bail by yeah not alarming a lot

5148.21 --> 5151.869
about it but I've been saying it at the

5149.98 --> 5153.449
beginning even without ones like why

5151.869 --> 5157.389
don't they just have an Internet blog

5153.449 --> 5159.909
it's this stupid the default Wi-Fi with

5157.389 --> 5166.7390000000005
no other options this is [ __ ] I hate

5159.909 --> 5170.65
this [ __ ] like that caused me to abandon

5166.739 --> 5174.098999999999
Apple products entirely just completely

5170.65 --> 5176.579
say no I'm never going with this again

5174.099 --> 5180.579
because they're not giving me an option

5176.579 --> 5185.679
they're forcing me to use [ __ ] that I

5180.579 --> 5189.119
don't want to use if I would buy

5185.679 --> 5192.04
something of that so I never did never

5189.119 --> 5193.48
and I stuck to PC even though I kind of

5192.04 --> 5195.909
hated him because Bill Gates you

5193.48 --> 5196.48
remember Bill Gates and never really

5195.909 --> 5199.329
liked the guy

5196.48 --> 5201.82
but yeah Windows Windows was like the

5199.329 --> 5206.44
thing it worked it kept on working and

5201.82 --> 5207.929
had all the games I was a gamer so yeah

5206.44 --> 5210.4
I stuck to it

5207.929 --> 5214.0
although original would have loved that

5210.4 --> 5217.329
yeah the Amiga branch the Commodore

5214.0 --> 5222.699
company that went bust in the 90s I wish

5217.329 --> 5223.78
they had actually well not broken down

5222.699 --> 5225.46
like they did

5223.78 --> 5228.28
and crashed with the failed project

5225.46 --> 5233.4890000000005
terrible terrible project game console

5228.28 --> 5239.59
project and moved on to an actual I

5233.489 --> 5242.11
don't know type of halfway console PC

5239.59 --> 5245.849
platform and I wish they had really

5242.11 --> 5248.949
competed that would have been awesome

5245.849 --> 5251.469
but they never got to it they just went

5248.949 --> 5253.589999999999
bust and it was gone all that potential

5251.469 --> 5256.02
was all gone just like that

5253.59 --> 5262.469
Amiga and Commodore had managed

5256.02 --> 5265.4490000000005
wireframe and even polygon 3d before

5262.469 --> 5267.21
before the mainstream had even caught on

5265.449 --> 5271.32
that that was an option

5267.21 --> 5274.86
okay people were screwing with like

5271.32 --> 5278.139
demos as they were called incredible 3d

5274.86 --> 5283.179
generated demos on Commodore 64's and

5278.139 --> 5286.0
Amiga 1200 when that was still being

5283.179 --> 5290.829
applied experimentally in freaking

5286.0 --> 5293.469
sci-fi movies okay that's how good the

5290.829 --> 5296.049999999999
Commodore system was how incredibly

5293.469 --> 5300.75
flexible it could perform way beyond

5296.05 --> 5300.75
what it was originally sized up to do

5301.139 --> 5304.96
said no you can only have eight sprites

5303.67 --> 5306.909
you don't even know what that means it's

5304.96 --> 5310.3
official type of thing has to do with

5306.909 --> 5312.94
memory it it can only have H phrase oh

5310.3 --> 5317.2300000000005
wait no 60 oh wait

5312.94 --> 5320.348999999999
somebody managed to get 256 how did they

5317.23 --> 5322.239
do that they rerouted the entire system

5320.349 --> 5324.789
inside just through programming in order

5322.239 --> 5326.879999999999
to make that possible making it slightly

5324.789 --> 5329.86
slower but it was technically possible

5326.88 --> 5332.2300000000005
when the designers of this thing didn't

5329.86 --> 5334.239
even think it was possible that [ __ ]

5332.23 --> 5336.159
that's the Commodore that was the

5334.239 --> 5338.799999999999
amazing experience of that computer

5336.159 --> 5341.949
system and the pinnacle of it which was

5338.8 --> 5345.67
the Amiga 1200 what a great computer

5341.949 --> 5347.739
that was but yeah I wasn't meant to be

5345.67 --> 5352.65
and yeah we're now in an age where just

5347.739 --> 5355.989
games have gone so far beyond like the

5352.65 --> 5357.789
yeah there's so many options now it all

5355.989 --> 5359.919999999999
of that doesn't really

5357.789 --> 5363.099
as much anymore but just the

5359.92 --> 5364.9800000000005
foundational nature of what that

5363.099 --> 5371.650000000001
computer system was and what it could do

5364.98 --> 5377.289
at so many long-term potentials and yet

5371.65 --> 5381.94
it's yeah it's just been outgrown but I

5377.289 --> 5385.329
still have fond memories of it great

5381.94 --> 5387.848999999999
music great digital music on the Amiga

5385.329 --> 5390.03
1200 incredible sound effects on that

5387.849 --> 5390.03
one

5421.03 --> 5426.0
wow that sucks mark all that it sounds

5423.52 --> 5426.0
terrible

5444.0 --> 5451.1
all right yeah good servant I think that

5446.43 --> 5453.96
my idea for just kind of for second and

5451.1 --> 5460.200000000001
it's always with electronics and all

5453.96 --> 5462.75
that it's so important that it is that

5460.2 --> 5465.99
within the technology you have options

5462.75 --> 5468.9
in how you can do it the floods there

5465.99 --> 5471.57
should be like a law for this in a way

5468.9 --> 5473.3099999999995
although it let's not give any

5471.57 --> 5476.37
politicians an idea because they're just

5473.31 --> 5480.450000000001
gonna screw it up but it's like almost

5476.37 --> 5482.4
like a natural lot when technology all

5480.45 --> 5485.19
technology just should have different

5482.4 --> 5489.2699999999995
routes to with computers and all that to

5485.19 --> 5493.41
achieve the same goal and there should

5489.27 --> 5496.740000000001
be options you know should always be

5493.41 --> 5500.88
options and I think that this one with

5496.74 --> 5504.179999999999
the enforcing a wireless transfer in

5500.88 --> 5508.26
snot giving a plug option a wire option

5504.18 --> 5511.9800000000005
I think that that is really bad I think

5508.26 --> 5520.58
the option should be there always as a

5511.98 --> 5520.58
default and I hope it's gonna be heard

5521.06 --> 5527.04
should not be don't abandon wires you

5525.75 --> 5530.04
know it's really cool if you like

5527.04 --> 5536.4
wireless and all that's really nice but

5530.04 --> 5538.53
don't force your willingness to ignore

5536.4 --> 5539.96
any medical consequences about it

5538.53 --> 5542.28
anything

5539.96 --> 5545.04
don't force that on other people that

5542.28 --> 5550.92
are willing to take the responsibility

5545.04 --> 5553.68
to handle that that yeah one avoided

5550.92 --> 5558.02
don't force it on other people just

5553.68 --> 5562.02
because you don't believe in it okay

5558.02 --> 5565.400000000001
it's an important message anyway I think

5562.02 --> 5565.400000000001
I'm gonna run out to show guys

5566.31 --> 5572.01
it's a bit all over the place as usual

5572.25 --> 5579.82
I'm just gonna think sit outside in the

5575.86 --> 5583.57
shadow and just let the wind breeze on

5579.82 --> 5588.63
me because I'm cooking here it's very

5583.57 --> 5590.429999999999
warm despite the Sun not getting inside

5588.63 --> 5593.5
poof

5590.43 --> 5595.900000000001
