fed live what they do or me what I

339.16 --> 343.0
do you can make a fair

347.8 --> 353.759
comparison yeah okay well I'm clarifying

350.479 --> 356.8
it right now for you duper that's right

353.759 --> 358.47900000000004
now so you don't need to reference it

356.8 --> 361.04
any

358.479 --> 368.779
further

361.04 --> 368.779
[Music]

387.039 --> 391.4
all right

388.4 --> 391.4
anyhow

391.96 --> 396.88
uh yesterday yeah Owen Benjamin did a

393.88 --> 399.88
bonus stream that was interesting

396.88 --> 401.52
although it was kind of like during pey

399.88 --> 404.4
live treatment he didn't really do it

401.52 --> 406.0
ball busters he just did a treatment

404.4 --> 410.479
which was

406.0 --> 413.56
fun I watched like half of

410.479 --> 416.039
it and then Owen Benjamin started bonus

413.56 --> 417.879
stream out of nowhere and yeah that was

416.039 --> 420.84
just a lot of fun and it will be there

417.879 --> 423.36
today again so

420.84 --> 426.039
that's very unusual that Owen does

423.36 --> 430.12
streams in the weekends

426.039 --> 430.12
too I'm looking forward to

434.36 --> 441.16
that two very different shows

437.919 --> 441.15999999999997
yeah of

444.3 --> 447.36
[Music]

448.319 --> 451.319
course

456.73 --> 459.79
[Music]

460.84 --> 464.67999999999995
say some words and learn nothing yeah

462.72 --> 469.319
well duper that's because technically

464.68 --> 472.599
he's not like it FID is

469.319 --> 474.91900000000004
Advanced like most of them don't really

472.599 --> 479.639
have the patience to explain

474.919 --> 483.44
it to the more simple levels oh

479.639 --> 486.0
something I very specifically try to add

483.44 --> 488.039
as much to Fed when I'm in there as

486.0 --> 490.479
possible and then everybody's like yeah

488.039 --> 493.08
we get it already Arwin like yeah yeah

490.479 --> 496.87899999999996
but does the rest of them get

493.08 --> 500.12
it you know I don't say it anymore but I

496.879 --> 503.28000000000003
mean it seems kind of obvious like yeah

500.12 --> 506.039
you might also want like we just gave

503.28 --> 508.599
the brilliant concise explanation how

506.039 --> 511.87899999999996
about a very simple version so like the

508.599 --> 515.0
people that aren't really deeply

511.879 --> 517.279
ingrained into our thinking also get a

515.0 --> 519.479
hint of what the [ __ ] we're talking

517.279 --> 522.399
about

519.479 --> 524.6
right it's one of the things I I I like

522.399 --> 527.04
to add because I think that's that's

524.6 --> 527.0400000000001
good to

527.58 --> 531.4190000000001
[Music]

533.0 --> 536.44
do so we'll

538.2 --> 543.5600000000001
see

540.11 --> 547.24
[Music]

543.56 --> 547.2399999999999
answer question

554.16 --> 560.959
what you mean answer and A and Q would

558.56 --> 564.279
be more beneficial

560.959 --> 567.4399999999999
what what you mean for FD you think that

564.279 --> 572.03
he's that Nathan's going to do this what

567.44 --> 576.6590000000001
I do with a life chat are you

572.03 --> 576.659
[Music]

577.36 --> 582.88
joking you got to be joking

579.959 --> 586.64
duper yeah what what you got here with

582.88 --> 589.24
my show that's relatively

586.64 --> 591.24
unique I mean there's other flat

589.24 --> 593.5600000000001
earthers that also interact with their

591.24 --> 598.2
chat in their live streams kind of like

593.56 --> 601.1199999999999
my setup but I mean they're usually not

598.2 --> 601.12
very technical

604.76 --> 609.56
[Music]

606.32 --> 614.6400000000001
I don't think he's going to do it

609.56 --> 617.5189999999999
uh no duh cuz that's not how Fed

614.64 --> 619.88
works it's how the Flat Earth early bird

617.519 --> 619.88
show

625.6 --> 631.24
Works hello Neil no swearing I haven't

629.519 --> 635.2
sworn anything

631.24 --> 635.2
yet and if I do I

649.2 --> 655.36
do right so did any of you actually

652.16 --> 659.639
check you're behind oh

655.36 --> 663.44
okay did any of you actually check the

659.639 --> 664.76
Flat Water video he posted another one a

663.44 --> 668.6
very short

664.76 --> 670.72
version maybe even better I mean it's a

668.6 --> 674.0790000000001
fascinating map he has some good

670.72 --> 677.24
commentary in it in this video

674.079 --> 680.0
it's almost 10

677.24 --> 682.8
minutes definitely check it

680.0 --> 685.839
out it's just very interesting because

682.8 --> 688.0
it's just shows like this is like the

685.839 --> 690.36
French act this is like the French

688.0 --> 693.56
Academy of Science

690.36 --> 695.8000000000001
during the exploration age fascinating

693.56 --> 698.279
it makes me forget sometimes like the

695.8 --> 700.3199999999999
way things really were happening right I

698.279 --> 703.88
always say like oh the Dutch preceded

700.32 --> 707.48
the English yeah but the French also

703.88 --> 711.16
like the French probably did most of the

707.48 --> 711.16
exploring of all of

711.639 --> 715.6
Europe and this is like one of those

713.959 --> 717.959
maps that reveal

715.6 --> 722.32
it like they got a

717.959 --> 724.5999999999999
pretty complete realm in it relatively

722.32 --> 726.9590000000001
complete like it's very amazing that

724.6 --> 729.9200000000001
they got it like in

726.959 --> 732.3599999999999
760 is before the United States is even

729.92 --> 732.36
officially

736.72 --> 743.1600000000001
formed never heard of him dude Flat

739.959 --> 743.16
Water was there since

744.279 --> 749.36
2015 like I was like Mark serent and

747.399 --> 752.839
then suddenly Flatwater popped out of

749.36 --> 752.839
nowhere it was really freaky

760.399 --> 763.399
too

769.24 --> 777.279
okay cuz he had certain symbols in his

773.839 --> 777.2790000000001
videos was really

777.839 --> 780.839
freaky

796.6 --> 800.8000000000001
was probes right around the time

798.76 --> 803.8
everybody completely Got

800.8 --> 803.8
Hijacked

807.24 --> 812.32
what it you 2015 you

816.639 --> 825.6800000000001
think what do you mean what exactly who

820.6 --> 829.6800000000001
Got Hijacked oh 760 all right

825.68 --> 829.68
uh well not at the

833.279 --> 838.959
time no I don't think so I think look

836.6 --> 842.16
the Ballers are always saying oh we had

838.959 --> 845.079
for thousands of years [ __ ] [ __ ]

842.16 --> 848.279
sorry I don't care swearing

845.079 --> 853.2399999999999
whatever oh no I don't get an ad that

848.279 --> 856.959
literally I get like 2% off wow yeah uh

853.24 --> 858.72
2% of 2 cent you you figure it

856.959 --> 861.88
out

858.72 --> 865.9200000000001
uh but

861.88 --> 869.12
uh they always say like oh it was no no

865.92 --> 871.16
no it it simply was the way it was back

869.12 --> 874.44
then and it's been like that for I think

871.16 --> 877.8
like the real mind control education

874.44 --> 879.839
grabbling with the globe ideas I think

877.8 --> 882.7589999999999
that really kind of

879.839 --> 885.1600000000001
started to get pushed through education

882.759 --> 887.0790000000001
well when education became bigger like

885.16 --> 889.68
in

887.079 --> 893.3599999999999
the in the 19th

889.68 --> 895.8389999999999
century late 18th something yeah 19th

893.36 --> 898.36
century

895.839 --> 900.32
really that's when the idea started to

898.36 --> 902.759
se deep in the schools and there was

900.32 --> 905.8000000000001
still huge resistance everybody was just

902.759 --> 907.72
like biblical and and they didn't want

905.8 --> 911.3199999999999
any of

907.72 --> 914.0400000000001
it and then like futurism ideas and

911.32 --> 916.0400000000001
science fiction became introduced and

914.04 --> 917.959
it's still people held on pretty much

916.04 --> 920.959
until the

917.959 --> 921.8
960s and that's when suddenly they made

920.959 --> 924.4399999999999
their

921.8 --> 926.959
move and then now everybody's like

924.44 --> 929.6
claiming like oh what it was Mr thousand

926.959 --> 931.959
of years [ __ ]

929.6 --> 931.9590000000001
no

937.959 --> 942.0
way had a good Navy to to that's what

940.759 --> 943.839
the Roman

942.0 --> 947.12
what

943.839 --> 950.519
uh I don't know about that Neil I mean

947.12 --> 954.079
the Roman Empire there's like a

950.519 --> 956.5600000000001
huge Chasm there okay there's a thousand

954.079 --> 957.5999999999999
years that don't exist that have been

956.56 --> 960.5999999999999
put in

957.6 --> 960.6
there

961.56 --> 968.4799999999999
so you got to see like Christ was much

964.839 --> 972.399
closer to us and basically Medieval

968.48 --> 972.399
Times have been completely made

972.6 --> 977.9590000000001
up what it it's not a thousand years in

976.079 --> 980.959
between like we're here is this a

977.959 --> 982.5189999999999
thousand years ago and here is Christ

980.959 --> 985.68
yeah it's

982.519 --> 987.92
actually very close all of it all of it

985.68 --> 989.16
happened very close I think that like

987.92 --> 992.68
you could say

989.16 --> 995.4399999999999
the Crusades happened right after

992.68 --> 999.3599999999999
Christ like this is how the timeline how

995.44 --> 1001.9590000000001
you should like it's all

999.36 --> 1005.6800000000001
compacted so the Roman

1001.959 --> 1010.04
Empire transitioned into the

1005.68 --> 1013.12
theocracy very very quickly yeah they

1010.04 --> 1016.4399999999999
give us the idea like oh the Jesus came

1013.12 --> 1019.079
and then thousand years of

1016.44 --> 1021.8000000000001
Catholicism no

1019.079 --> 1025.4389999999999
the Rome Roman Empire kind of

1021.8 --> 1028.12
transformed what it was almost

1025.439 --> 1030.0790000000002
overnight it probably happened like in

1028.12 --> 1033.1599999999999
in just a decade or something that they

1030.079 --> 1035.799
just completely changed everything that

1033.16 --> 1038.1200000000001
they were what they did what they

1035.799 --> 1041.76
focused on and changed their entire

1038.12 --> 1044.4799999999998
model from Imperial

1041.76 --> 1046.439
military and that all became secondary

1044.48 --> 1049.84
and then they just focused purely on

1046.439 --> 1052.52
Banking and religious mind

1049.84 --> 1055.24
control and happened very quickly and

1052.52 --> 1057.44
they just made up a thousand years to to

1055.24 --> 1059.28
basically convince every yeah we've been

1057.44 --> 1061.559
here for a thousand years we're the

1059.28 --> 1064.12
ultimate ruler we can never be defeated

1061.559 --> 1065.72
and they literally made it up they made

1064.12 --> 1068.12
it up that they were even there that

1065.72 --> 1070.48
long it's a a full scale mind control

1068.12 --> 1072.799
program that took place with

1070.48 --> 1075.84
them they didn't

1072.799 --> 1078.08
lose they just transformed and then

1075.84 --> 1080.6
created a story of an ancient Roman

1078.08 --> 1085.039
Empire oh bet they used to be yeah

1080.6 --> 1085.039
[ __ ] you're still that you just

1086.76 --> 1093.679
transformed and made up a thousand years

1089.12 --> 1093.6789999999999
of history in between that's what you

1095.36 --> 1102.559
did was the Romans lack of a good

1099.44 --> 1104.919
Navy well they just they didn't have any

1102.559 --> 1107.32
in they were they were just wanted

1104.919 --> 1111.919
Europe and North

1107.32 --> 1114.28
Africa is they just wanted that region

1111.919 --> 1116.96
and they had good

1114.28 --> 1120.44
enough they had good enough Navy it's

1116.96 --> 1123.52
just not their biggest interest it was

1120.44 --> 1123.52
not their

1129.799 --> 1137.6399999999999
focus like also because it wasn't known

1133.88 --> 1139.96
about the limes right so yeah oh well we

1137.64 --> 1142.1200000000001
can build huge ships and send our armies

1139.96 --> 1144.24
and then half your [ __ ] armies die

1142.12 --> 1147.3999999999999
when you arrive how long is that power

1144.24 --> 1151.76
going to last right there's no point in

1147.4 --> 1154.88
even having a huge navy for an Empire if

1151.76 --> 1156.919
like everyone all your soldiers

1154.88 --> 1159.5200000000002
continually die every time you take a

1156.919 --> 1164.5200000000002
long trip there's no there not durable

1159.52 --> 1164.52
na that's why they didn't have a naval

1167.24 --> 1174.64
Empire right Naval Empires started when

1172.12 --> 1178.28
limes were

1174.64 --> 1178.2800000000002
discovered to prevent

1180.039 --> 1186.08
scurvy before that it was always super

1183.48 --> 1187.48
risky and it was really for the crazy

1186.08 --> 1190.1589999999999
Adventurer

1187.48 --> 1192.3600000000001
types that would go on ships like okay

1190.159 --> 1193.88
I'm going to take the risk it's a good

1192.36 --> 1195.039
chance I'm going to die and like oh my

1193.88 --> 1197.5590000000002
crew is probably going to but I'm going

1195.039 --> 1199.0
to risk it I'm going to find something

1197.559 --> 1202.6399999999999
and when I find find something I'm going

1199.0 --> 1205.159
to bring it back right until they

1202.64 --> 1207.44
finally discovered like good limes and

1205.159 --> 1209.48
everything and then now suddenly it's

1207.44 --> 1211.76
like yeah yeah now we can just go

1209.48 --> 1216.52
everywhere without dying all the time

1211.76 --> 1216.52
and now Imperial opportunity is

1217.76 --> 1220.76
born

1221.44 --> 1227.0800000000002
anyway so of course the Romans didn't

1224.08 --> 1230.1589999999999
have a big Naval Empire would not have

1227.08 --> 1230.1589999999999
been durable

1234.039 --> 1238.24
right like even with Celestial

1236.44 --> 1241.28
navigation that they might have had

1238.24 --> 1244.52
already in fall like the Romans might

1241.28 --> 1247.3999999999999
have already had Celestial

1244.52 --> 1250.6
navigation they could have explored the

1247.4 --> 1253.6000000000001
Sease but it just wasn't worth it

1250.6 --> 1253.6
everybody would keep

1254.159 --> 1258.2
dying even if they could find their way

1256.559 --> 1263.32
right think about it like that that's

1258.2 --> 1263.32
the logic that's how things happen

1269.039 --> 1274.6
really all wars are fake what what does

1271.919 --> 1274.6000000000001
that even mean

1275.84 --> 1282.32
duper

1278.32 --> 1282.32
no Wars definitely

1285.76 --> 1294.6
happen men love guiling no any animal

1290.08 --> 1297.8799999999999
any group animal riled up loves killing

1294.6 --> 1297.8799999999999
sing star it's not human

1298.08 --> 1308.0
alone ever seen Apes go to war

1303.08 --> 1312.36
vicious like brutal okay it's not just

1308.0 --> 1314.919
man all group animals can have War it's

1312.36 --> 1317.039
it's an instinct and it's been

1314.919 --> 1319.0
manipulated and

1317.039 --> 1320.6
abused

1319.0 --> 1323.64
by

1320.6 --> 1325.6789999999999
rulers of course it's like there's no

1323.64 --> 1330.44
war without there being some kind of

1325.679 --> 1332.52
advantage or profit for the ruler like

1330.44 --> 1334.6000000000001
that won't happen or they'll perish

1332.52 --> 1337.84
right somebody attacks them and they

1334.6 --> 1337.84
can't handle it yeah and then they

1338.559 --> 1346.24
perish but uh Wars definitely do

1343.24 --> 1346.24
happen

1346.32 --> 1351.279
Super mar AR yeah just because people

1349.36 --> 1354.039
make treaties doesn't mean that they

1351.279 --> 1356.52
that War's not real yeah you can have a

1354.039 --> 1359.12
treaty with somebody you're at war with

1356.52 --> 1361.24
you just both choose not to do that

1359.12 --> 1363.799
specific

1361.24 --> 1366.159
thing right while you're trying to take

1363.799 --> 1366.1589999999999
one

1367.64 --> 1373.24
another because you have mutual interest

1370.84 --> 1376.0
the ruler specifically not to do

1373.24 --> 1379.96
anything with that and that's how a

1376.0 --> 1379.96
treaty is born despite world wars

1381.44 --> 1386.279
because none of the involved ruling

1383.679 --> 1387.1200000000001
parties has interest in doing anything

1386.279 --> 1390.36
with

1387.12 --> 1392.559
that or interest in exploiting it for

1390.36 --> 1392.559
the

1397.84 --> 1404.36
war like they don't want the hassle for

1401.4 --> 1405.48
some reason now why that reason is we

1404.36 --> 1408.24
don't

1405.48 --> 1410.24
know but just because they have that CRA

1408.24 --> 1412.799
treaty Al together doesn't mean that

1410.24 --> 1412.799
there's no

1419.039 --> 1426.52
war do what does that have to do with

1422.159 --> 1426.5200000000002
anything duper me being

1428.559 --> 1434.48
there I'm trying to explain to you about

1431.44 --> 1436.88
treaties and War how that works it's

1434.48 --> 1439.88
very

1436.88 --> 1439.88
possible

1448.96 --> 1453.919
right another example maybe of entirely

1452.4 --> 1457.1200000000001
different raes

1453.919 --> 1460.3600000000001
non-european would be like hey there's

1457.12 --> 1462.0
these kingdoms uh yeah we want to [ __ ]

1460.36 --> 1464.6399999999999
the other Kingdom

1462.0 --> 1467.08
Up For Whatever some long-standing

1464.64 --> 1469.0
rivalry of whatever and they but they

1467.08 --> 1471.6
have this treaty you see it's like yeah

1469.0 --> 1474.44
it would really demoralize if we just

1471.6 --> 1476.08
killed all their priests right but their

1474.44 --> 1479.3200000000002
priests are of the same

1476.08 --> 1481.8799999999999
religion so we're just both while we're

1479.32 --> 1484.9189999999999
at War going to decide yeah we're not

1481.88 --> 1487.5590000000002
going to kill each other's priests and

1484.919 --> 1490.1200000000001
that's like now almost like standard War

1487.559 --> 1492.799
rules right you don't Church you're not

1490.12 --> 1495.36
supposed to attack a church right that

1492.799 --> 1497.9189999999999
that came from that that's a called a

1495.36 --> 1500.36
treaty a treaty within the war you you

1497.919 --> 1502.76
make this you make decisions not to do

1500.36 --> 1502.76
certain

1526.679 --> 1529.679
things

1556.679 --> 1559.679
for

1561.88 --> 1565.3990000000001
right ra G yeah

1577.559 --> 1586.52
probably where no duper stop having such

1580.76 --> 1586.52
a solop cystic nonsense spiral here stop

1586.6 --> 1589.6
it

1590.679 --> 1595.64
Wars are real people get killed there's

1593.399 --> 1599.36
video material of that [ __ ] these days

1595.64 --> 1602.159
it happens people do it they slaughter

1599.36 --> 1605.039
one another to

1602.159 --> 1607.3600000000001
dominate that's what they do duper get

1605.039 --> 1607.36
over

1616.6 --> 1619.6
it

1628.52 --> 1634.2
I'm the only person that ever used the

1630.6 --> 1635.279
word solipsistic why I'm not the only

1634.2 --> 1638.279
one I

1635.279 --> 1643.679
just it for me it's a very easy word to

1638.279 --> 1643.679
go to because it is a prevalent

1644.48 --> 1650.799
mindset out there it's logic that it's

1648.24 --> 1653.3990000000001
there too because of the overwhelming

1650.799 --> 1656.6399999999999
nature of the preponderance of

1653.399 --> 1659.1589999999999
information and the overemphasis on the

1656.64 --> 1660.8400000000001
wrong things and manipulation yeah that

1659.159 --> 1663.2
drives people to

1660.84 --> 1665.4399999999998
solipsism CU you're like oh they're all

1663.2 --> 1668.039
lying about everything well then maybe

1665.44 --> 1670.2
everything is a lie maybe everything

1668.039 --> 1672.72
every single idea I've ever had was a

1670.2 --> 1675.0800000000002
lie and I'm just a brain in a jar right

1672.72 --> 1676.519
that's what have solipsistic reversal is

1675.08 --> 1678.36
what I call

1676.519 --> 1681.2
that

1678.36 --> 1683.279
and it will happen more and more more

1681.2 --> 1686.1200000000001
overwhelmed you

1683.279 --> 1688.48
get the more the tendency comes around

1686.12 --> 1691.76
to say like oh well then everything is

1688.48 --> 1693.08
fake like even I'm fake like this is not

1691.76 --> 1697.039
even

1693.08 --> 1699.6789999999999
real yeah Escape escape the pressure

1697.039 --> 1701.48
because you can't use you can't use that

1699.679 --> 1704.3990000000001
responsibility you don't know what to do

1701.48 --> 1709.44
with those insights it overwhelms you

1704.399 --> 1709.4399999999998
escape deny it all deny anything is real

1717.64 --> 1722.0
solipsism hello dank by the way good to

1719.84 --> 1722.0
see

1736.399 --> 1741.4799999999998
you

1738.08 --> 1741.48
hey steamy traveler good to see

1748.64 --> 1754.519
you I'm going to turn on my coffee be

1752.24 --> 1754.519
right

1766.32 --> 1769.32
back

1792.51 --> 1795.65
[Music]

1796.32 --> 1799.32
for

1820.36 --> 1823.36
what

1823.96 --> 1829.24
what

1826.24 --> 1829.24
okay

1852.36 --> 1857.4799999999998
oh questioning stuff is solop system no

1855.36 --> 1861.24
it's not questioning stuff it's just

1857.48 --> 1863.08
stating like maybe it's does anit exist

1861.24 --> 1865.72
maybe nothing

1863.08 --> 1870.0
happened yeah that's not questioning

1865.72 --> 1872.679
things that's just oh what if nothing is

1870.0 --> 1875.0
real let's say postulation and

1872.679 --> 1878.88
consideration of

1875.0 --> 1882.159
denial that's not questioning stuff it

1878.88 --> 1885.3200000000002
is solop sism do but you

1882.159 --> 1888.8400000000001
did you don't have to stop talking about

1885.32 --> 1891.72
it just realize that that is what that

1888.84 --> 1895.1999999999998
is now if you have questions about like

1891.72 --> 1897.84
oh did the wars really happen for the

1895.2 --> 1900.48
reasons that were noted in the history

1897.84 --> 1902.72
books as to why they happened yeah

1900.48 --> 1905.3990000000001
that's a really good question the answer

1902.72 --> 1909.48
is absolutely not of course that's all

1905.399 --> 1911.08
hor [ __ ] it's all lies the reasons why

1909.48 --> 1913.559
it's because a bunch of [ __ ] Bankers

1911.08 --> 1916.36
wanted to make a lot of [ __ ] money

1913.559 --> 1917.72
and they grabble the rulers the scheme

1916.36 --> 1919.84
and plan

1917.72 --> 1923.32
that would do it get a lot of people

1919.84 --> 1926.4399999999998
killed secure the power of the

1923.32 --> 1929.639
rulers politically and get the bankers

1926.44 --> 1931.3200000000002
very very rich that's why Wars happen

1929.639 --> 1934.08
that's why they always happen that's why

1931.32 --> 1936.639
they' have always happened and then the

1934.08 --> 1939.76
history writers bring make up a good

1936.639 --> 1942.36
story that dumb enough people will buy

1939.76 --> 1945.039
and still feel comfortable with

1942.36 --> 1948.639
repeating that's how it

1945.039 --> 1952.279
works yeah but Wars do

1948.639 --> 1957.4399999999998
happen it's not just a madeup

1952.279 --> 1960.039
story that nobody dies in reality they

1957.44 --> 1964.039
do they go at each other and kill each

1960.039 --> 1964.039
other and blow each other up y they

1965.44 --> 1971.0
do it's just the reasons why is always a

1968.36 --> 1971.0
bunch of hor

1972.159 --> 1980.159
[ __ ] but that's not how that works duper

1976.519 --> 1980.159
printing money doesn't mean

1986.399 --> 1992.7199999999998
anything you don't understand anything

1988.96 --> 1996.799
about money it's it yeah because you can

1992.72 --> 1999.519
print it out of thin air it doesn't mean

1996.799 --> 2002.84
anything the only thing that's real is

1999.519 --> 2005.84
control over others then if you have

2002.84 --> 2009.0
literal money conjuration Powers then

2005.84 --> 2010.76
your real power is going to be the power

2009.0 --> 2013.84
you have over others and what you can

2010.76 --> 2018.279
make them do you can make them sacrifice

2013.84 --> 2018.279
their own life for you with your

2021.12 --> 2026.4399999999998
Illusions and stupid deals where you

2024.039 --> 2028.36
didn't see you thought you could get oh

2026.44 --> 2029.679
I could get I could be a soldier I could

2028.36 --> 2032.32
be a

2029.679 --> 2033.76
badass right I get make money I get

2032.32 --> 2036.4399999999998
secure and then you go to war and then

2033.76 --> 2039.44
you die and they know when they go to

2036.44 --> 2039.44
war you didn't

2042.84 --> 2047.9599999999998
know yeah they plan

2045.2 --> 2049.8
wars so you don't get to hear about that

2047.96 --> 2052.639
[ __ ] you only get to hear when you have

2049.8 --> 2052.639
to train for

2061.76 --> 2067.5200000000004
one numbers yeah of course Ste I mean

2065.2 --> 2069.4399999999996
there's like but I mean that's not

2067.52 --> 2071.56
really War anymore if it's just like oh

2069.44 --> 2074.44
we're just going to secretly murder a

2071.56 --> 2077.7599999999998
bunch of people out there and not tell

2074.44 --> 2081.359
anybody that's not really War a war is

2077.76 --> 2081.3590000000004
like an open declared

2085.879 --> 2088.879
thing

2092.359 --> 2098.879
right otherwise it's just you're just

2094.639 --> 2098.879
pirating or raiding a bunch of people

2106.839 --> 2112.56
because yeah I mean

2109.0 --> 2116.4
War dude General violence and and

2112.56 --> 2119.119
criminal raiding and pirating

2116.4 --> 2123.359
dude there's way more of that than there

2119.119 --> 2126.4
are Wars way more violent [ __ ]

2123.359 --> 2128.839
everywhere all the time well maybe not

2126.4 --> 2131.1600000000003
as much now anymore although it's still

2128.839 --> 2134.2
there but I mean in the past in the far

2131.16 --> 2138.0
past it was just all the

2134.2 --> 2141.56
time all the time like that that's why

2138.0 --> 2143.72
you had cities that's why people would

2141.56 --> 2146.4
gather together in relatively cramped

2143.72 --> 2148.4399999999996
living conditions because You' have a

2146.4 --> 2151.079
giant wall surrounding you so that you

2148.44 --> 2151.839
don't have to worry every [ __ ] day

2151.079 --> 2154.599
whether you were going to get

2151.839 --> 2157.04
slaughtered by a bunch of Raiders yeah

2154.599 --> 2159.04
because that was there then we don't

2157.04 --> 2162.319
really realize that anymore like most of

2159.04 --> 2164.839
that is all gone it's all so neutered

2162.319 --> 2167.48
and peaceful now comparative even with

2164.839 --> 2170.64
all the hassle and all the crazy people

2167.48 --> 2174.44
and junkies and

2170.64 --> 2176.68
religious fanatical ass wipes attacking

2174.44 --> 2180.0
one another all that right we have that

2176.68 --> 2182.68
but I mean compare it to like 500 years

2180.0 --> 2185.64
ago like there was like

2182.68 --> 2187.48
continual violent assault and rape and

2185.64 --> 2189.359
murder everywhere

2187.48 --> 2192.2
and the government couldn't even control

2189.359 --> 2194.56
it like even though they were king of a

2192.2 --> 2198.16
Nation they didn't have a grip on it it

2194.56 --> 2198.16
was like country is too

2199.56 --> 2206.04
big so everything has definitely

2206.8 --> 2212.119
improved and now it's like why the hell

2209.56 --> 2213.52
do we want to live in a city oh for the

2212.119 --> 2215.28
convenience yeah well you're getting

2213.52 --> 2217.48
like plundered and everything's too

2215.28 --> 2219.6800000000003
expensive and too Crump

2217.48 --> 2221.68
is not what it used to be because you

2219.68 --> 2223.2
don't really have protection anymore in

2221.68 --> 2226.96
a city now do

2223.2 --> 2229.7999999999997
you well 500 years ago yeah cities

2226.96 --> 2233.4
protected you there was a big

2229.8 --> 2234.8
wall so when the regular armies came by

2233.4 --> 2237.839
or Raider

2234.8 --> 2241.28
groups you're in the city you're good it

2237.839 --> 2244.7999999999997
was worth the price it was very strong

2241.28 --> 2246.44
security compared to outside of the city

2244.8 --> 2248.52
when it's like oh they can buy you just

2246.44 --> 2250.359
die

2248.52 --> 2253.44
it's just like oh just get enough kids

2250.359 --> 2257.2
and then hopefully enough Will Survive

2253.44 --> 2261.04
and much more insecure comparatively

2257.2 --> 2263.2
right City walls big important now it

2261.04 --> 2265.52
doesn't mean anything anymore there's no

2263.2 --> 2267.96
more Raiders roaming around killing and

2265.52 --> 2267.96
looting

2269.04 --> 2273.68
everybody now they do that through the

2271.52 --> 2278.24
tax

2273.68 --> 2282.3999999999996
system and through political

2278.24 --> 2285.9599999999996
nining they just chose another

2282.4 --> 2285.96
format to get

2289.599 --> 2296.2400000000002
theirs H hey Here We Go

2292.72 --> 2296.24
Again Steven

2305.52 --> 2308.52
Jaris

2311.72 --> 2317.7599999999998
Bitcoin based ETFs drove the prices

2318.92 --> 2323.7200000000003
down I don't know did

2327.76 --> 2335.3590000000004
they I have no idea

2330.72 --> 2337.5989999999997
stei maybe the Bitcoin thing just rattle

2335.359 --> 2340.0789999999997
too many grapper pages and they were

2337.599 --> 2342.4
like even though it's basically their

2340.079 --> 2345.079
invention that they were like no we

2342.4 --> 2348.4
don't want that so it's just like oh

2345.079 --> 2350.5600000000004
like oh no the regular money is better

2348.4 --> 2353.4
it's better it's cheaper I don't know

2350.56 --> 2357.319
man I don't know why that stuff

2353.4 --> 2359.44
happens ask Max Kaiser or

2357.319 --> 2362.359
something you'll probably know a lot

2359.44 --> 2362.359
more about it than I

2365.44 --> 2368.44
do

2379.24 --> 2386.56
right but I mean look the whole

2382.52 --> 2388.52
thing just think of it 500 years ago

2386.56 --> 2391.24
cities

2388.52 --> 2393.7599999999998
Raiders like criminals that were in

2391.24 --> 2396.0789999999997
gangs and that had material like you

2393.76 --> 2397.0
raid a couple of soldiers you have your

2396.079 --> 2400.52
weapon

2397.0 --> 2403.16
R and then it's just like sub fuge hide

2400.52 --> 2405.079
and raid hide and very annoying very

2403.16 --> 2406.72
hard to get rid of when you have

2405.079 --> 2408.8
relatively low

2406.72 --> 2411.52
intelligence as in intelligence

2408.8 --> 2413.76
gathering systems in that era right it's

2411.52 --> 2416.359
just people and you see something you

2413.76 --> 2419.8390000000004
hear something that's

2416.359 --> 2422.04
it much harder and much easier for

2419.839 --> 2426.44
criminals to hide and all

2422.04 --> 2428.92
that much more costly to go after them

2426.44 --> 2430.52
more it would cost more soldiers to like

2428.92 --> 2432.16
actually go after so it wouldn't be

2430.52 --> 2433.88
worth it because then you get one and

2432.16 --> 2435.56
another one Rises up and then you have

2433.88 --> 2439.6800000000003
to start all over

2435.56 --> 2442.2799999999997
again right so they just built walls big

2439.68 --> 2445.319
walls and then made deals out of it it's

2442.28 --> 2447.92
like oh you can be in the wall you have

2445.319 --> 2449.7599999999998
greater security and that would be worth

2447.92 --> 2451.839
it it's like oh wow I'm going to build

2449.76 --> 2454.8390000000004
my Bank inside the wall definitely oh

2451.839 --> 2458.88
I'm going to build my

2454.839 --> 2462.319
wellworking develop in crafting company

2458.88 --> 2464.319
inside the walls and it be worth it it

2462.319 --> 2466.68
would be better quality I can I can make

2464.319 --> 2468.92
that and that's like how the whole city

2466.68 --> 2471.44
system formed and

2468.92 --> 2475.0
now there's no more Raiders out there

2471.44 --> 2478.76
but now the new dangerous Mass

2475.0 --> 2480.88
immigration which is not like direct

2478.76 --> 2485.0
Wars or anything but

2480.88 --> 2487.0
it's it'll just invoke a similar

2485.0 --> 2490.599
scenario to ways

2487.0 --> 2493.72
but now it's like yeah can you legally

2490.599 --> 2496.28
keep them out right Raiders outside the

2493.72 --> 2498.16
city walls 500 years ago yeah those were

2496.28 --> 2499.4
criminals those were officially criminal

2498.16 --> 2503.72
you could definitely keep them out of

2499.4 --> 2506.839
walls now like yeah but the the big

2503.72 --> 2509.8799999999997
Overlord un organization said that we

2506.839 --> 2512.24
are we can do this and then it's like

2509.88 --> 2514.96
nobody dares to keep them out of the

2512.24 --> 2517.1189999999997
Cities then they don't know how to keep

2514.96 --> 2520.359
the the Raiders out of the walls because

2517.119 --> 2522.56
now they have like I got legal contract

2520.359 --> 2524.88
sorry not Indian accent is not

2522.56 --> 2528.44
appropriate whatever the accent's going

2524.88 --> 2530.2400000000002
to be right oh we got the

2528.44 --> 2532.0
contract yeah how the hell are you going

2530.24 --> 2537.04
to keep that outside of the walls yeah

2532.0 --> 2538.8
you can't so we got to now completely

2537.04 --> 2541.24
reconfigure the

2538.8 --> 2544.6800000000003
setup how do we get this [ __ ] under

2541.24 --> 2549.24
control well first off stop the mass

2544.68 --> 2551.72
migration and like more effort to Route

2549.24 --> 2554.9199999999996
out the bad the bad

2551.72 --> 2557.24
apples and quick don't let them linger

2554.92 --> 2560.2400000000002
for 20 years hoping to discour they'll

2557.24 --> 2564.1189999999997
never go away they don't go away you

2560.24 --> 2568.2799999999997
have to send them back or away whatever

2564.119 --> 2568.28
back away get the [ __ ] out of

2575.16 --> 2578.16
here

2580.599 --> 2585.4
what what the hell are you talking about

2582.76 --> 2585.4
hero

2587.839 --> 2595.64
again sudden this report report what

2590.839 --> 2598.52
does that mean showed poral what poral

2595.64 --> 2602.359
what why did that blew your

2598.52 --> 2602.359
mind what are you talking

2605.079 --> 2608.079
about

2626.48 --> 2630.72
yeah seeking star yeah that video I did

2628.52 --> 2632.8
also watch that while

2630.72 --> 2635.0789999999997
back right I'm going to get my coffee

2632.8 --> 2638.079
I'll be right

2635.079 --> 2638.079
back

2730.04 --> 2736.88
damn it muted thanks thanks for saying

2734.319 --> 2741.16
that I was thinking

2736.88 --> 2744.559
back about the Romans transition into

2741.16 --> 2747.0
the the Catholic church and how that

2744.559 --> 2747.96
would have happened very quickly because

2747.0 --> 2751.52
like the

2747.96 --> 2754.88
Romans are technically kind of

2751.52 --> 2758.599
theatrical as in like they

2754.88 --> 2761.52
use their equipment and the style and

2758.599 --> 2765.3590000000004
the the hawk on the stick and everything

2761.52 --> 2768.4
like like it's theatrical it has a

2765.359 --> 2771.04
psychological influence so they use the

2768.4 --> 2773.7200000000003
psychological influence on top of combat

2771.04 --> 2777.079
techniques Etc that was like how they

2773.72 --> 2780.3999999999996
did it it was their thing but the

2777.079 --> 2783.48
theatrical part is not in the way they

2780.4 --> 2786.52
act it's in the way they look you

2783.48 --> 2788.88
recognize that I hope so I'm asking the

2786.52 --> 2793.079
chat I hope you recognize that about the

2788.88 --> 2796.319
Romans right even when you look at like

2793.079 --> 2799.52
movies or whatever about it they have a

2796.319 --> 2800.92
theatrical look to them they the the way

2799.52 --> 2804.64
they look

2800.92 --> 2807.88
is is there to influence and impress

2804.64 --> 2814.1189999999997
you just by the

2807.88 --> 2814.119
look I hope you guys recognize that do

2814.319 --> 2824.2
you if you do say yes in the

2819.44 --> 2824.2000000000003
chat if you don't then say

2827.88 --> 2832.839
no right thanks Richie

2833.92 --> 2837.88
G shut up Tommy

2837.92 --> 2842.52
smartass maybe there's a delay or

2840.0 --> 2845.28
something I don't know what it

2842.52 --> 2847.839
is I think like the YouTube videos like

2845.28 --> 2850.2400000000002
delayed for some reason a

2847.839 --> 2853.7999999999997
bit you didn't think you noticed that

2850.24 --> 2857.68
before well notice it now and I mean a

2853.8 --> 2859.599
lot of ancient armies typically did that

2857.68 --> 2863.359
like you could say Native American

2859.599 --> 2867.44
warriors did it too like they used the

2863.359 --> 2871.2
feathers right and like even Vikings

2867.44 --> 2875.2000000000003
they would use like animal skins like to

2871.2 --> 2876.5989999999997
be like I'm a bear right the it's the

2875.2 --> 2877.5589999999997
influence

2876.599 --> 2879.599
the

2877.559 --> 2881.92
influencing of those you're fighting

2879.599 --> 2884.92
with it's not just what techniques are

2881.92 --> 2887.599
you using as a soldier right it's also

2884.92 --> 2890.359
how do you look how what is your

2887.599 --> 2893.28
composure what is how are you going to

2890.359 --> 2896.0
impress the opponent like centurions

2893.28 --> 2899.96
right and the Romans had a very

2896.0 --> 2902.96
specific style in that they did it a

2899.96 --> 2905.2
certain ways like uniformity like mass

2902.96 --> 2907.92
in numbers which is kind of like

2905.2 --> 2910.64
communist took that over the Chinese

2907.92 --> 2912.88
have learned from that uniformity

2910.64 --> 2915.4
massive numbers looking the same but

2912.88 --> 2916.44
also just like helmet and the feathers

2915.4 --> 2920.28
and

2916.44 --> 2923.079
like bulky muscly looking armors it's

2920.28 --> 2925.3190000000004
all style all

2923.079 --> 2927.48
theatrical and they were probably strong

2925.319 --> 2929.92
to but they just overemphasized it more

2927.48 --> 2931.2
and more all these things to influence

2929.92 --> 2933.119
to

2931.2 --> 2937.359
impress

2933.119 --> 2941.48
well and then one

2937.359 --> 2943.44
day like the emperor is talking with the

2941.48 --> 2947.839
Senate and it's

2943.44 --> 2950.92
like I've we have to like we're not

2947.839 --> 2954.119
going to survive this we have to

2950.92 --> 2957.16
transform and we have to make up this

2954.119 --> 2959.599
entire transition process for the new

2957.16 --> 2962.24
format because if we just do it they'll

2959.599 --> 2964.3590000000004
not accept it and will'll all die so we

2962.24 --> 2966.839
have to like do a major mind control

2964.359 --> 2968.24
program make couple thousand years and

2966.839 --> 2972.2799999999997
like literally

2968.24 --> 2974.68
transform the Roman empire into the into

2972.28 --> 2978.7200000000003
this new religious order and we're going

2974.68 --> 2980.7599999999998
to totally own them we'll so overwhelm

2978.72 --> 2982.359
them they'll never know what hit them

2980.76 --> 2984.76
they'll think they're into the future

2982.359 --> 2986.72
and they will be the future is

2984.76 --> 2989.2400000000002
Catholicism and this is how we do it and

2986.72 --> 2992.3999999999996
then it's like oh so bring in the main

2989.24 --> 2995.52
soldiers now besides like psychological

2992.4 --> 2998.119
combat tactics you're going to learn

2995.52 --> 3000.319
certain stories and these stories are

2998.119 --> 3002.88
going to be really

3000.319 --> 3004.64
important and you're going to help

3002.88 --> 3006.599
spread these stories and tell these

3004.64 --> 3009.839
stories to others and you're going to

3006.599 --> 3012.44
like change the way you dress so instead

3009.839 --> 3014.92
of this armor stuff you're going to like

3012.44 --> 3016.92
look like a like a priest we're going to

3014.92 --> 3020.2000000000003
have this Mighty

3016.92 --> 3021.92
hat thing for some of you right and

3020.2 --> 3025.96
we're going to have like this hierarchy

3021.92 --> 3028.799
and and they just like just basically

3025.96 --> 3030.7200000000003
from one year to the other wearing all

3028.799 --> 3033.28
armor doing all the soldiers just like

3030.72 --> 3035.72
oh and now that suddenly turned into a

3033.28 --> 3038.52
priesthood and they still had soldiers

3035.72 --> 3041.7599999999998
and all that right I mean Vatican has

3038.52 --> 3046.04
its own Army so they always had that the

3041.76 --> 3048.7990000000004
Army aspect it just wasn't the main

3046.04 --> 3051.119
thing like the what's the Roman Empire

3048.799 --> 3054.28
what do you think of a Roman soldier in

3051.119 --> 3056.119
armor a centurion that's what everybody

3054.28 --> 3059.559
thinks of when they think of ROM because

3056.119 --> 3061.7200000000003
that was their icon it was the thing

3059.559 --> 3064.2000000000003
about them that was their like

3061.72 --> 3067.319
identity most

3064.2 --> 3070.2
recognizable besides like aqueducts

3067.319 --> 3075.119
and all that and how Emperors

3070.2 --> 3075.1189999999997
looked right the Senate

3075.559 --> 3081.76
people and then they just changed that

3078.92 --> 3084.16
they just changed the entire

3081.76 --> 3086.28
plan and they did it quickly and like

3084.16 --> 3089.16
training them and then suddenly like

3086.28 --> 3091.76
yeah no more armors we now just you're

3089.16 --> 3094.1189999999997
now the high priest instead of our top

3091.76 --> 3096.44
soldiers you're now our high priest and

3094.119 --> 3099.319
you have to like use your soldiery

3096.44 --> 3102.2000000000003
tricks still but without

3099.319 --> 3104.2799999999997
fighting to mind control all these

3102.2 --> 3106.359
people they would have all had more

3104.28 --> 3109.079
training on like how do you tell the

3106.359 --> 3111.119
stories how do you how do we do the a

3109.079 --> 3112.799
training training training but not

3111.119 --> 3115.48
military

3112.799 --> 3117.359
training communication training mind

3115.48 --> 3120.2
control

3117.359 --> 3122.359
training learning about the people about

3120.2 --> 3124.799
their superstitions how can you play in

3122.359 --> 3127.5989999999997
like learn everything about everybody

3124.799 --> 3129.799
and that would have been a massive

3127.599 --> 3133.92
undertaking that was like all behind

3129.799 --> 3136.839
closed doors right in their romanic

3133.92 --> 3138.92
churches that were all giant thick

3136.839 --> 3140.839
closed walls without Windows where they

3138.92 --> 3143.0
did things in secret what would they

3140.839 --> 3146.599
have been doing could it be concocting

3143.0 --> 3149.64
an entire new history transforming from

3146.599 --> 3152.6400000000003
soldiery to Pure spiritual mind

3149.64 --> 3155.319
control and like creating the stories

3152.64 --> 3157.96
and and just

3155.319 --> 3159.88
reshaping the culture around them like

3157.96 --> 3162.319
that

3159.88 --> 3164.119
yeah romanic that's probably what they

3162.319 --> 3167.7599999999998
were doing in these romanic churches

3164.119 --> 3169.96
where like regular citizens weren't even

3167.76 --> 3173.0
allowed in it was priests only because

3169.96 --> 3175.079
they were concocting how to recreate the

3173.0 --> 3177.24
entire world that's what they were doing

3175.079 --> 3177.2400000000002
there

3179.119 --> 3185.92
yeah finding God yeah sure you were I'm

3182.799 --> 3188.2
sure some of you were but the majority

3185.92 --> 3190.319
was mostly there to figure out how do we

3188.2 --> 3194.5589999999997
freaking transform this entire world and

3190.319 --> 3194.5589999999997
become the ultimate unseen ruler of

3203.48 --> 3211.44
it fascists performed on

3206.92 --> 3211.44
mass yeah sure here we go again I

3212.319 --> 3220.5589999999997
mean a lot of later Empires took a lot

3217.52 --> 3223.4
of hints from the Romans why because the

3220.559 --> 3227.6400000000003
Romans were impressive and they

3223.4 --> 3230.599
worked and so an Empire wants to

3227.64 --> 3233.0
dominate they want to they want to be

3230.599 --> 3235.7200000000003
felt like they're the new

3233.0 --> 3237.4
Romans because that's so impressive

3235.72 --> 3240.0789999999997
and they have been so massively

3237.4 --> 3242.92
successful to the degree where they

3240.079 --> 3245.6800000000003
literally changed everything we even

3242.92 --> 3249.6800000000003
know they completely rewrote history

3245.68 --> 3253.2
it's still in place their entire massive

3249.68 --> 3257.319
mination of a thousand years is still in

3253.2 --> 3261.0
place and official right now yeah that's

3257.319 --> 3264.119
how [ __ ] impressive the Romans

3261.0 --> 3268.2
were so yeah no wonder new empires want

3264.119 --> 3268.2000000000003
to be look like the

3268.4 --> 3273.559
Romans they were so unbelievably

3271.119 --> 3276.119
powerful they're still controlling us

3273.559 --> 3278.599
right now and most and like

3276.119 --> 3281.319
99.999% of the people don't even know

3278.599 --> 3285.2000000000003
that yeah that's how [ __ ]

3281.319 --> 3287.2799999999997
unbelievably powerful the Romans were so

3285.2 --> 3290.48
long ago and

3287.28 --> 3291.6800000000003
still they're just not visible anymore

3290.48 --> 3294.44
like

3291.68 --> 3295.5989999999997
that they've hidden within the

3294.44 --> 3296.799
misinformation

3295.599 --> 3299.88
that

3296.799 --> 3302.72
they gave us and now we don't have

3299.88 --> 3305.559
anything else yeah that's where their

3302.72 --> 3308.2799999999997
power is now the their power the Romans

3305.559 --> 3311.4
power is in all the things that we

3308.28 --> 3314.44
learned that are wrong but that we have

3311.4 --> 3317.76
to accept as real that's their power

3314.44 --> 3317.76
that's the Roman power

3320.0 --> 3327.0
now the government lie that's the Roman

3324.44 --> 3327.0
power

3337.64 --> 3340.44
yes Neil

3346.92 --> 3349.92
really

3350.319 --> 3356.52
anyway it occupies my mind at

3353.76 --> 3358.44
times and must be hilarious like actual

3356.52 --> 3359.799
Catholic priests out there it's like

3358.44 --> 3363.7200000000003
what the

3359.799 --> 3366.319
hell but they they

3363.72 --> 3368.52
probably probably all of them by now

3366.319 --> 3372.96
they do know like

3368.52 --> 3375.28
yeah it sounds too crazy to be true but

3372.96 --> 3375.28
it's

3378.52 --> 3383.4
true right because hey in this world if

3381.0 --> 3386.92
it sounds too crazy to be true it's

3383.4 --> 3386.92
probably true

3399.48 --> 3405.119
and that way the controllers can stay

3401.92 --> 3408.319
ahead of the curve of

3405.119 --> 3411.359
acceptable digestible

3408.319 --> 3414.119
belief they just keep doing things that

3411.359 --> 3415.88
are too crazy to be true and then get

3414.119 --> 3421.839
away with it because because of

3415.88 --> 3421.839
that cuz people just can't handle

3421.92 --> 3425.839
it so they do that

3429.599 --> 3436.6800000000003
now overt to covert yeah that's a good

3432.4 --> 3436.6800000000003
one I'm going to use that in my title

3443.799 --> 3446.799
actually

3450.11 --> 3453.289
[Applause]

3471.69 --> 3474.889
[Music]

3475.92 --> 3478.559
oh

3494.44 --> 3500.839
almost yeah okay this [ __ ] fit how the

3497.48 --> 3503.72
Roman Empire transformed rewrote history

3500.839 --> 3506.2799999999997
and Rule our mind

3503.72 --> 3508.72
today

3506.28 --> 3508.7200000000003
that should

3513.16 --> 3516.3999999999996
work did

3517.24 --> 3521.4799999999996
I yeah it's in there

3532.16 --> 3537.16
good yeah I'm sorry that this video

3535.24 --> 3539.0
with an awesome title like that is not

3537.16 --> 3543.0789999999997
actually a full

3539.0 --> 3544.68
on historical presentation with like oh

3543.079 --> 3547.319
look at this book and look at that book

3544.68 --> 3550.5989999999997
yeah no it's not like that this

3547.319 --> 3550.599
is an

3550.839 --> 3558.2799999999997
idea that I really think is legitimate

3555.28 --> 3558.28
it's just

3559.039 --> 3565.6800000000003
forming it's been on my mind for like a

3562.799 --> 3570.16
long time and

3565.68 --> 3572.44
it's very hard to even try to coherently

3570.16 --> 3574.2
formulate any of it it's hard to tell

3572.44 --> 3579.68
the story of

3574.2 --> 3584.0
it even without like the like historical

3579.68 --> 3590.799
or facts or official registered things

3584.0 --> 3593.64
like it's all very tough to to see

3590.799 --> 3596.64
this that this

3593.64 --> 3596.64
happened

3598.16 --> 3604.319
but it must have it must have happened

3602.039 --> 3606.6800000000003
and it must have happened like that like

3604.319 --> 3609.88
I tried to describe something close to

3606.68 --> 3612.2799999999997
that I can see it it's like there's no

3609.88 --> 3612.28
other

3616.72 --> 3623.7599999999998
way right a thousand years apart I mean

3621.0 --> 3625.559
people it breaks everybody's head

3623.76 --> 3628.7200000000003
because we're so so used to like

3625.559 --> 3629.96
trusting on the linear reliability of

3628.72 --> 3633.319
his

3629.96 --> 3635.96
historical recorded things Etc we

3633.319 --> 3638.119
already know by now it's been caught on

3635.96 --> 3639.64
by on average like yeah carbon dating is

3638.119 --> 3644.2400000000002
not super

3639.64 --> 3648.68
reliable fossil dating is absolute

3644.24 --> 3648.68
nonsense like that's literal nonsense

3649.319 --> 3655.16
unprovable but to just like accept like

3652.72 --> 3656.9599999999996
yeah a thousand years were made up

3655.16 --> 3658.96
they were literally conjured out of

3656.96 --> 3662.2
nothing and then everything must have

3658.96 --> 3665.48
been placed within it from the past

3662.2 --> 3667.7599999999998
place within it and from very recent

3665.48 --> 3670.68
place within it and then spread out to

3667.76 --> 3673.079
create a very complicated bigger history

3670.68 --> 3676.16
story I

3673.079 --> 3679.2000000000003
mean the undertaking for the project to

3676.16 --> 3681.48
put that together must have been like

3679.2 --> 3686.2
one of the

3681.48 --> 3687.2
biggest writing projects of mankind to

3686.2 --> 3690.359
just

3687.2 --> 3695.0
create that entire

3690.359 --> 3695.0
history rearranges it's just

3699.52 --> 3705.92
mindblowing how am I with

3702.96 --> 3707.079
food well I had dinner yesterday and I'm

3705.92 --> 3709.079
good for

3707.079 --> 3712.4
tomorrow or for

3709.079 --> 3716.799
today and I get got some scraps from

3712.4 --> 3719.0
paypals that I can get food Monday so

3716.799 --> 3721.52
I'm all right but I mean for me it's

3719.0 --> 3724.96
usually just like two days ahead of time

3721.52 --> 3727.52
and and just be very very very thankful

3724.96 --> 3731.0
for what you get like I'm so happy that

3727.52 --> 3732.7599999999998
I like got fresh bread and eggs and and

3731.0 --> 3735.76
I can just have great lunch after this

3732.76 --> 3735.76
I'm so happy about

3742.0 --> 3748.079
it an impressive performance is it

3745.559 --> 3753.3590000000004
Ryan I get the feeling you're just kind

3748.079 --> 3753.3590000000004
of always trying to be a sarcastic [ __ ]

3754.52 --> 3758.319
everywhere I notied your

3763.799 --> 3768.44
comments people will be over a

3768.88 --> 3775.6800000000003
no who says people will oh you really

3772.039 --> 3778.039
think someday that true what are you

3775.68 --> 3778.0389999999998
talking

3778.16 --> 3783.5989999999997
about were you being serious sorry then

3781.079 --> 3785.6800000000003
I didn't mean to call you [ __ ] but I

3783.599 --> 3789.48
mean I get the feeling a lot that you're

3785.68 --> 3791.9199999999996
just like falsely complimenting me yeah

3789.48 --> 3793.799
I mean my story here is not super

3791.92 --> 3795.52
impressive it's just something that

3793.799 --> 3798.279
needs to be thought

3795.52 --> 3800.72
about because it's

3798.279 --> 3802.48
true but it's not going to be like oh

3800.72 --> 3804.0
people are going to watch this and oh

3802.48 --> 3805.68
I'm going to share like this is not

3804.0 --> 3808.88
going to be the most freaking shared

3805.68 --> 3810.24
show in the world okay it doesn't work

3808.88 --> 3813.279
like

3810.24 --> 3816.5589999999997
that and it's often that when you get

3813.279 --> 3818.88
really really impactful big implicative

3816.559 --> 3822.119
things early

3818.88 --> 3826.319
out then nobody does anything with it

3822.119 --> 3829.76
yeah you know how long how many years

3826.319 --> 3832.5589999999997
years it took before I even got like a

3829.76 --> 3834.92
response whenever I would state that the

3832.559 --> 3837.279
son was a hologram

3834.92 --> 3839.6800000000003
you know how many years it took before

3837.279 --> 3843.599
people even started to respond to me

3839.68 --> 3846.279
saying that yeah

3843.599 --> 3848.92
why because it's so

3846.279 --> 3852.48
overwhelming and it's so

3848.92 --> 3855.0
different and there is no overwhelming

3852.48 --> 3857.48
presentation evidence to back it up

3855.0 --> 3860.039
somehow like a documentary it's not

3857.48 --> 3862.16
there it's just logic it's just an

3860.039 --> 3864.279
Insight an explanation and it's

3862.16 --> 3866.72
mindboggling and it's real it's what

3864.279 --> 3869.88
comes out of me and people don't then

3866.72 --> 3871.799
just throw themselves at me at all

3869.88 --> 3873.839
everybody's just like what the [ __ ] are

3871.799 --> 3876.72
you talking that sounds

3873.839 --> 3879.839
crazy that's how people respond I know

3876.72 --> 3883.9599999999996
that and it doesn't mean I'm wrong no it

3879.839 --> 3886.64
means I'm [ __ ] right because if I was

3883.96 --> 3888.2400000000002
just playing into popular ideas that are

3886.64 --> 3891.359
going around then everybody would jump

3888.24 --> 3893.839
on me for just saying generic

3891.359 --> 3896.44
horeshit that makes them feel like oh

3893.839 --> 3898.68
they informed they knew that too the

3896.44 --> 3902.2000000000003
generic horeshit everybody keeps talking

3898.68 --> 3902.2
about right now all the

3902.44 --> 3908.52
time yeah that's how you get everybody

3905.559 --> 3912.6400000000003
to pile on I don't care I want to bring

3908.52 --> 3916.64
you things that are literally not out

3912.64 --> 3919.0
there but they will be because I'm

3916.64 --> 3922.359
putting them out there and they're going

3919.0 --> 3924.359
to be out there beside myself the idea

3922.359 --> 3927.16
is going to spill forth It's it's going

3924.359 --> 3929.359
to be constructed real historical

3927.16 --> 3930.279
researchers and competent people are

3929.359 --> 3936.72
going

3930.279 --> 3936.72
to catch on and start to build

3938.599 --> 3944.2400000000002
it I know they will they

3941.88 --> 3945.96
do there's so there by the way there are

3944.24 --> 3947.5589999999997
people out there that have made big

3945.96 --> 3950.48
projects trying

3947.559 --> 3952.3590000000004
to show you and prove about the Thousand

3950.48 --> 3955.88
Years that were conjured that's already

3952.359 --> 3958.88
out there but I mean mean there's

3955.88 --> 3960.76
more and those individuals have probably

3958.88 --> 3963.2000000000003
also been kind of like ignored as like

3960.76 --> 3963.2000000000003
Niche

3964.52 --> 3969.48
researches so even though they might

3966.88 --> 3973.7200000000003
have been successful they would still be

3969.48 --> 3975.88
ignored right just like yeah I'm saying

3973.72 --> 3977.52
yeah son's nonlocal hologram this is

3975.88 --> 3979.52
what we know of it this is they got the

3977.52 --> 3981.599
angles it's never anywhere exactly

3979.52 --> 3985.52
there's light manifest all these

3981.599 --> 3987.52
descriptions it's like yeah yeah yeah

3985.52 --> 3991.64
does that mean that people are going to

3987.52 --> 3994.16
repeat that and accept that

3991.64 --> 3995.96
no just because it's right doesn't mean

3994.16 --> 3999.1189999999997
that everybody's just going to like

3995.96 --> 4001.119
accept it in the contrary it's usually

3999.119 --> 4003.2400000000002
the other way around the more accurate

4001.119 --> 4005.079
and real you are the tougher it's going

4003.24 --> 4007.52
to be the more people are going to

4005.079 --> 4007.52
reject

4007.92 --> 4014.44
it that's my experience but if it's

4011.799 --> 4018.0389999999998
really true then no matter how much they

4014.44 --> 4020.2400000000002
rejected at the offset it's going to go

4018.039 --> 4021.96
through it's going to take some time and

4020.24 --> 4023.839
then it's going to sink in and then it's

4021.96 --> 4026.0
just going to reappear and all the

4023.839 --> 4028.799
people are suddenly going to say like

4026.0 --> 4031.44
wow I just came up with this I never

4028.799 --> 4033.4
watched Arwin or anything who is that no

4031.44 --> 4036.839
I just came up with this five years

4033.4 --> 4041.079
later I completely I did that I never

4036.839 --> 4042.72
saw anybody right yeah and then suddenly

4041.079 --> 4045.039
like oh yeah yeah of course of course

4042.72 --> 4047.16
celesti is are holographic duh what else

4045.039 --> 4049.0
are they going to be right I mean we

4047.16 --> 4050.68
don't have Arwin to thank for that 10

4049.0 --> 4053.079
years ago coming up with that and we all

4050.68 --> 4055.1189999999997
called them

4053.079 --> 4059.319
crazy

4055.119 --> 4061.6400000000003
right but of course that's true duh like

4059.319 --> 4063.839
what else it is right is not an object

4061.64 --> 4067.5589999999997
in any position so yeah that's what it

4063.839 --> 4069.48
is so yeah of course I mean has nothing

4067.559 --> 4071.2000000000003
to do with Arwin I mean he only came up

4069.48 --> 4074.2
with it 10 years ago when nobody

4071.2 --> 4075.5989999999997
everybody thought he was crazy right he

4074.2 --> 4077.2
didn't make money out of it he didn't

4075.599 --> 4080.3590000000004
have a book deal he's not rich he's

4077.2 --> 4083.24
still begging for money so nobody cares

4080.359 --> 4085.279
thanks Arwin for the idea we never knew

4083.24 --> 4088.5989999999997
you literally going to deny you ever

4085.279 --> 4090.319
exist but we're take your damn idea oh

4088.599 --> 4091.96
yeah and then claim the honors for

4090.319 --> 4095.0389999999998
ourselves and then think that

4091.96 --> 4098.199
collectively we're all Superior too for

4095.039 --> 4099.08
it all of it yes I know you will because

4098.199 --> 4102.799
you're

4099.08 --> 4102.799
humans and that's what you

4102.839 --> 4105.839
do

4115.799 --> 4118.799
yeah

4125.759 --> 4129.08
H oh

4129.199 --> 4134.5199999999995
Cleary I'm still

4132.799 --> 4136.64
here

4134.52 --> 4139.52
did I scare you all away or did Neil

4136.64 --> 4139.52
scare you all

4155.12 --> 4158.12
away

4162.719 --> 4165.719
yeah

4189.319 --> 4195.4800000000005
oh Paul Cook probably has an interesting

4191.839 --> 4199.36
stream going on right now but

4195.48 --> 4199.36
Yep this is the early bir show

4208.84 --> 4214.96
so right but one thing that I always

4212.36 --> 4217.199
thought is that what really drove

4214.96 --> 4220.28
original Roman Empire and then later

4217.199 --> 4222.639999999999
even the Catholic church was

4220.28 --> 4225.199
just blind

4222.64 --> 4228.8
ambition

4225.199 --> 4231.04
in a way like Satan like an insatiable

4228.8 --> 4234.2390000000005
Spirit of

4231.04 --> 4236.76
more that would like the Romans would

4234.239 --> 4238.799999999999
like Drive each like they would never

4236.76 --> 4240.8
settle it's like no we have to keep

4238.8 --> 4242.6
developing we have to become better we

4240.8 --> 4245.320000000001
have to be better at what we're already

4242.6 --> 4247.679
doing have to reinvent ourselves

4245.32 --> 4249.599999999999
continually always pushing pushing

4247.679 --> 4250.719
pushing more and more and that's

4249.6 --> 4254.320000000001
probably

4250.719 --> 4255.96
that collecting that over like I

4254.32 --> 4258.12
Century or couple of century I don't

4255.96 --> 4262.199
know how long the Romans were really in

4258.12 --> 4263.88
that in that military format like that

4262.199 --> 4265.919999999999
they might have gone through several

4263.88 --> 4268.52
transition who knows where they really

4265.92 --> 4273.08
came from you really buy the Romulus

4268.52 --> 4278.8
Remis story do you right yeah we don't

4273.08 --> 4282.84
know how it all started we just don't

4278.8 --> 4285.2390000000005
H but we do know that they were always

4282.84 --> 4287.1990000000005
trying to stay top of the games top of

4285.239 --> 4290.48
the Mind Control top of

4287.199 --> 4292.12
knowledge engineering things fascinated

4290.48 --> 4293.44
with engineering I mean the freaking

4292.12 --> 4296.28
Romans

4293.44 --> 4298.638999999999
guys and now it's not maybe 2,000 years

4296.28 --> 4300.639
ago but like at least a thousand and

4298.639 --> 4306.2390000000005
more years ago had

4300.639 --> 4307.400000000001
like steam powered doors and crap like

4306.239 --> 4311.839999999999
that

4307.4 --> 4311.839999999999
okay serious like

4312.56 --> 4315.719
bro

4314.679 --> 4320.88
they took

4315.719 --> 4323.6
it very far but logically they kept it

4320.88 --> 4327.12
like a wizard secret it's like no these

4323.6 --> 4330.639
are our secet like we know stee power

4327.12 --> 4334.5599999999995
yeah it's a Deadly Secret you're too

4330.639 --> 4338.04
curious about that you

4334.56 --> 4341.4400000000005
die that's how they dealt with that

4338.04 --> 4344.84
right that's a Deadly Secret like you

4341.44 --> 4347.919999999999
found out that oh it's not the gods that

4344.84 --> 4350.2390000000005
open the door it's a steam device you

4347.92 --> 4353.0
you understand that you're [ __ ] dead

4350.239 --> 4356.638999999999
or you get to work for them and probably

4353.0 --> 4358.719
also that however it works it was all

4356.639 --> 4361.88
these engineering things were very

4358.719 --> 4364.76
secretive that's why they were like very

4361.88 --> 4365.96
close to like the priest classes that

4364.76 --> 4367.8
did

4365.96 --> 4371.719
things

4367.8 --> 4374.360000000001
right but they had all that ambition

4371.719 --> 4376.4800000000005
like almost psychopath AIC ambition and

4374.36 --> 4379.08
there would have been plenty of

4376.48 --> 4381.839999999999
psychopaths among the Romans

4379.08 --> 4383.8
too would have been very convenient for

4381.84 --> 4387.08
the war apparatus because yeah

4383.8 --> 4390.639
psychopath can make a very effective

4387.08 --> 4393.719
Soldier when properly controlled and

4390.639 --> 4396.4800000000005
instructed so just that's the type of

4393.719 --> 4400.08
people and then that type of people and

4396.48 --> 4401.28
how they have done things that has then

4400.08 --> 4405.36
suddenly

4401.28 --> 4407.679
transformed like Central organized R

4405.36 --> 4409.5599999999995
transformation radical like a

4407.679 --> 4411.4800000000005
transformation not keeping transforming

4409.56 --> 4413.719
within how do we do War better how do we

4411.48 --> 4417.678999999999
do our thing better no no no just

4413.719 --> 4420.04
suddenly like what completely like we're

4417.679 --> 4421.96
taking all that idea all that ambition

4420.04 --> 4423.6
and just starting from scratch and we're

4421.96 --> 4426.96
going to do it completely different now

4423.6 --> 4429.52
we're a religious Empire and we do

4426.96 --> 4431.56
Banking and all that and they just

4429.52 --> 4437.4800000000005
completely reinvented

4431.56 --> 4437.4800000000005
themselves like super ambitious

4437.6 --> 4443.4400000000005
satanists

4440.12 --> 4446.08
yeah those types of people that were

4443.44 --> 4450.879999999999
back then in the Roman Empire and then

4446.08 --> 4450.88
the Catholic Church those are now

4451.96 --> 4457.4
Bankers the bankers are now the

4455.28 --> 4459.599999999999
satanists it's the people that are

4457.4 --> 4462.199
always like

4459.6 --> 4464.639
relentlessly developing and seeking more

4462.199 --> 4466.199
control and like they nothing to stop

4464.639 --> 4470.88
them there's no

4466.199 --> 4475.44
human part of them that just says

4470.88 --> 4479.0
enough enough stop it just be

4475.44 --> 4481.199
this they they stopped listening to that

4479.0 --> 4483.199
and that's why they have all that power

4481.199 --> 4485.719
that's why they had all that

4483.199 --> 4487.48
power during the Roman era and that's

4485.719 --> 4489.6
why they had all that power during the

4487.48 --> 4491.839999999999
Catholic era the

4489.6 --> 4494.400000000001
theocracy and that's why they have that

4491.84 --> 4497.88
power now in the age of of

4494.4 --> 4500.879999999999
Illusions within the

4497.88 --> 4500.88
banker

4512.0 --> 4515.36
industry everything can now be

4513.84 --> 4517.96
attributed to climate change yeah that's

4515.36 --> 4521.639
their little trick

4517.96 --> 4524.4
right I mean it's just a reformatting of

4521.639 --> 4527.8
the original Catholic religious

4524.4 --> 4529.719
model and now it's instead of like it's

4527.8 --> 4533.360000000001
like oh yeah we don't believe in Christ

4529.719 --> 4536.679
anymore oh it's all arcanic ideas oh

4533.36 --> 4537.96
space we're going to the Moon oh yes

4536.679 --> 4540.96
there's no

4537.96 --> 4543.04
God and then it's like oh okay well but

4540.96 --> 4545.8
since we established that's all real

4543.04 --> 4547.5199999999995
where we went to the moon there's no God

4545.8 --> 4550.320000000001
it's all just a bunch of religious mumbo

4547.52 --> 4555.080000000001
jumbo Christianity bad get it out of the

4550.32 --> 4559.28
West and uh what was I going to say oh

4555.08 --> 4563.5599999999995
yeah so since we're that's all behind us

4559.28 --> 4565.8
yeah now oh we now we can get to the the

4563.56 --> 4567.400000000001
Doom yeah because Christ is not there to

4565.8 --> 4569.6
save you anymore that's all nonsense now

4567.4 --> 4573.12
now it's all doom oh it's all going to

4569.6 --> 4576.719
die oh our presence is making Mother

4573.12 --> 4578.639
Earth angry we breathe too much it's not

4576.719 --> 4580.8
like we were specifically originally

4578.639 --> 4583.2390000000005
designed to do that and be a complex

4580.8 --> 4586.6
ecosystem which we learned through e

4583.239 --> 4586.599999999999
ology even in the 20th

4588.28 --> 4594.44
century ecology [ __ ] that yeah yeah it's

4591.48 --> 4598.959999999999
climate change you're so dangerous we're

4594.44 --> 4602.159
so dangerous oh the breathing oh no

4598.96 --> 4604.159
oh we're so screwed it's not like

4602.159 --> 4606.12
there's an ecological system that's just

4604.159 --> 4609.5599999999995
been designed like that and functioning

4606.12 --> 4613.36
for how many thousand years no climate

4609.56 --> 4616.0
change oh no the gases the gases oh no

4613.36 --> 4619.5599999999995
they fear the gas chamber the entire

4616.0 --> 4622.76
realm is one Giant gas chamber oh my God

4619.56 --> 4625.88
we have to get all the gases out of the

4622.76 --> 4628.04
gas chamber we're so

4625.88 --> 4632.12
dangerous

4628.04 --> 4635.08
no all hor [ __ ] it's just more [ __ ]

4632.12 --> 4639.04
[ __ ] because they took the old story

4635.08 --> 4641.4
away Christ away God a designer the Flat

4639.04 --> 4643.32
Earth took it all the way gave us a

4641.4 --> 4646.32
bunch of nonsense made everybody more

4643.32 --> 4650.799999999999
dumb now everybody's more dumb now they

4646.32 --> 4658.0
don't have anything to to protect them

4650.8 --> 4659.4400000000005
from just hey you bad mother earth good

4658.0 --> 4662.52
you must

4659.44 --> 4666.08
die yeah and they don't have anything to

4662.52 --> 4668.280000000001
protect them from such blatant satanic

4666.08 --> 4671.6
mind control orders to kill themselves

4668.28 --> 4675.28
anymore now

4671.6 --> 4678.76
yes welcome to to the 21st

4675.28 --> 4680.96
century so now when they just say oh

4678.76 --> 4684.360000000001
yeah we got to we got to cut down this

4680.96 --> 4686.96
Forest here why because of climate

4684.36 --> 4690.36
change tree is bad it's ruining nature

4686.96 --> 4692.96
we have to cut it down what that's crazy

4690.36 --> 4695.92
stop it we thought you loved nature

4692.96 --> 4699.08
that's why we did it no no no no no no

4695.92 --> 4701.12
trees are bad we have to cut them down

4699.08 --> 4702.719
so then everybody's like what the [ __ ]

4701.12 --> 4704.92
and then they just do it and they're

4702.719 --> 4704.92
like

4705.239 --> 4710.599999999999
okay what the [ __ ] just

4707.88 --> 4713.0
happened oh oh oh by the way there's new

4710.6 --> 4715.88
plans oh yeah yeah there was this Forest

4713.0 --> 4720.32
here and it actually kind of got in the

4715.88 --> 4720.32
way of the new building plans they had

4723.639 --> 4729.08
there you didn't see that coming you

4727.0 --> 4731.08
didn't see that coming oh we had to cut

4729.08 --> 4734.32
down the trees the trees for climate

4731.08 --> 4737.48
change it it wasn't like a a blatant in

4734.32 --> 4740.0
yourf face front nonsense stories just

4737.48 --> 4743.718999999999
to get their way so they get make their

4740.0 --> 4746.6
little business deal destroying more

4743.719 --> 4750.36
Forest ground to have their private

4746.6 --> 4753.04
little business deal for a new building

4750.36 --> 4757.92
there what you you didn't think they

4753.04 --> 4759.28
would do that they wouldn't do that no

4757.92 --> 4762.4800000000005
but they're for they're

4759.28 --> 4764.5199999999995
environmentalists they care so much they

4762.48 --> 4767.638999999999
care so much that they're willing to

4764.52 --> 4769.92
kill everybody just for nature no no no

4767.639 --> 4772.400000000001
no no it's not for nature they're just

4769.92 --> 4774.96
willing to kill everybody they just

4772.4 --> 4778.36

4815.28 --> 4823.639
we could like lessen the damage have

4818.719 --> 4827.28
more morale be less wasteful less cha IC

4823.639 --> 4828.76
is to like no we just kill them all

4827.28 --> 4831.5599999999995
that's the climate change the climate

4828.76 --> 4836.0
change in their [ __ ] heads from being

4831.56 --> 4839.120000000001
a basic sens somewhat sensible human

4836.0 --> 4840.44
being with some issues to fullblown

4839.12 --> 4842.5599999999995
demonic

4840.44 --> 4847.5599999999995
psychopath that's

4842.56 --> 4847.56
just obsessed with Exterminating all of

4847.76 --> 4853.0
humanity climate change yes definitely a

4851.199 --> 4855.44
climate change going on in the their

4853.0 --> 4855.44
[ __ ]

4856.88 --> 4864.12
heads yeah we want all power we kill

4861.36 --> 4867.04
everything for all power that's the

4864.12 --> 4867.04
climate change that's

4874.76 --> 4877.76
happened

4879.159 --> 4883.44
yeah and they certainly don't give a

4881.679 --> 4886.76
[ __ ] about killing millions of

4883.44 --> 4890.5199999999995
ukrainians for a war that is calculated

4886.76 --> 4893.1990000000005
impossible to win so it's not even about

4890.52 --> 4897.1990000000005
oh we had to do it no it was just a

4893.199 --> 4901.239
convenient opportunity to get a lot of

4897.199 --> 4904.36
people killed cuz that's what they want

4901.239 --> 4908.159
yeah they don't care how it happens they

4904.36 --> 4911.639
just want a lot of people killed they're

4908.159 --> 4914.599999999999
obsessed they're obsessed with planning

4911.639 --> 4916.96
the the annihilation of people because

4914.6 --> 4919.679
every time it happens it's so [ __ ]

4916.96 --> 4922.12
convenient for them you know CU When

4919.679 --> 4924.719
people die money starts rolling and

4922.12 --> 4926.0
that's exactly what why they do they do

4924.719 --> 4928.92
it for

4926.0 --> 4930.76
themselves it's like oh yeah quickly we

4928.92 --> 4932.56
need another genocide because then we

4930.76 --> 4935.12
can make some

4932.56 --> 4937.679
money that that's where they're

4935.12 --> 4941.88
at quickly a genocide we need to make

4937.679 --> 4944.56
some money huh yeah oh climate change

4941.88 --> 4944.56
climate change

4945.0 --> 4949.04
oh yeah we just need to cut down this

4946.88 --> 4951.32
forest for climate

4949.04 --> 4954.56
change yeah we don't care that you tried

4951.32 --> 4959.08
to protect that from industrialist from

4954.56 --> 4960.88
the oil companies for for 100 years we

4959.08 --> 4963.639
don't care it's for climate change so we

4960.88 --> 4966.04
cut it down oh and next year yeah we got

4963.639 --> 4970.52
this new building we just built there

4966.04 --> 4972.84
and like y oh what you didn't know that

4970.52 --> 4975.679
company that always wanted to build that

4972.84 --> 4977.6
there now was part of the climate change

4975.679 --> 4980.679
again yeah they they buil they got their

4977.6 --> 4983.04
garbon credit so they now get to have

4980.679 --> 4985.6
the land because they paid their carbon

4983.04 --> 4987.4
credit yeah we know you try to protect

4985.6 --> 4990.120000000001
that forest from being cut down for a

4987.4 --> 4993.159
hundred years but they paid their carbon

4990.12 --> 4998.12
credits so they just get to cut it down

4993.159 --> 5003.199
[ __ ] you and die people [ __ ] you and

4998.12 --> 5005.12
die that's the message climate change

5003.199 --> 5009.839999999999
yeah climate

5005.12 --> 5012.28
change we get the genocide everybody now

5009.84 --> 5015.52
we're allowed to we're allowed to kill

5012.28 --> 5015.5199999999995
everybody now climate

5031.48 --> 5034.48
change

5042.0 --> 5047.88
yeah so I can get a little ticked off at

5045.199 --> 5047.879999999999
the world at

5061.36 --> 5064.36
times

5091.199 --> 5096.919999999999
all right here we go again see you later

5093.6 --> 5096.92
you disagree with

5105.55 --> 5108.72
[Music]

5112.719 --> 5118.04
what to be remind ice cream's favorite

5115.52 --> 5118.040000000001
food what

5121.28 --> 5124.28
the

5143.239 --> 5148.638999999999
oh he disagrees with you yeah well no

5145.199 --> 5148.638999999999
doubt what the hell did you

5151.28 --> 5156.8
say you don't think CO2 this should

5154.04 --> 5159.76
probably have no [ __ ] okay what did the

5156.8 --> 5163.28
kumu virus say that was

5159.76 --> 5163.280000000001
disagreeable didn't see

5168.08 --> 5173.639
any that's why he's out Rising

5178.4 --> 5183.92
what they suck at

5181.199 --> 5185.5199999999995
killing

5183.92 --> 5188.88
yeah but that's because the deal is

5185.52 --> 5192.400000000001
mostly like the whole point is like they

5188.88 --> 5192.400000000001
have to get people to kill

5195.08 --> 5201.679
themselves right that's the only

5198.4 --> 5203.679
way that they can prevent from

5201.679 --> 5206.119
instantane instantaneously

5203.679 --> 5208.28
disintegrating

5206.119 --> 5210.159
themselves and it's still going to

5208.28 --> 5214.199
happen in the end they're still going to

5210.159 --> 5214.199
be completely disintegrated

5214.28 --> 5222.119
there's no other way like you can't do

5219.36 --> 5224.44
this it's like either they kill

5222.119 --> 5229.04
everybody or everybody kills them

5224.44 --> 5229.04
there's no other way after all

5241.119 --> 5244.119
this

5247.0 --> 5250.36
the vampires suck

5252.04 --> 5259.84
at yeah but that's because vampires

5255.08 --> 5263.679
don't they don't necessarily want to

5259.84 --> 5263.679
kill they just want to

5266.88 --> 5272.88
feed right a vampire according to

5269.96 --> 5275.6
vampire General law only kills when

5272.88 --> 5277.8
somebody's a direct threat to them like

5275.6 --> 5280.1990000000005
they know and they want to stop them

5277.8 --> 5282.1990000000005
otherwise it's just like oh it's just

5280.199 --> 5284.678999999999
nice little drink here and then just

5282.199 --> 5287.678999999999
leave him and maybe come back

5284.679 --> 5287.679
later

5301.04 --> 5304.04
right

5308.48 --> 5312.759999999999
climate emergency yeah that's what the I

5310.88 --> 5315.76
think that we need climate change I

5312.76 --> 5319.84
think that we need to change the climate

5315.76 --> 5323.360000000001
as in the social climate as in the

5319.84 --> 5326.92
people that have become

5323.36 --> 5331.08
completely corporate

5326.92 --> 5333.08
soulless Psychopathic control freaks

5331.08 --> 5336.5199999999995
things that need the change I think that

5333.08 --> 5336.5199999999995
we need that climate

5349.32 --> 5357.92
change yeah don't care BR Johnson

5400.36 --> 5407.199
threat

5401.76 --> 5409.04
yeah Psychopathic climate change agenda

5407.199 --> 5414.119
based

5409.04 --> 5414.119
oligarchs conspiring together WF

5414.56 --> 5418.080000000001

5433.84 --> 5439.84
distractions it's right there right now

5439.84 --> 5445.159000000001
tell stories about a

5441.96 --> 5448.76
boogeyman when there's a real life

5445.159 --> 5452.599999999999
organized boogy man killing us

5448.76 --> 5454.92
all yeah it's time to [ __ ] fight

5452.6 --> 5454.92
no

5456.6 --> 5462.0
distractions yeah and indeed King

5458.84 --> 5464.1990000000005
Charles is arguably the new vampire lord

5462.0 --> 5466.52
I mean you can't get more literal than

5464.199 --> 5466.5199999999995
that

5469.56 --> 5476.400000000001
guys he is the 21st century C Dracula he

5473.96 --> 5476.4
really

5479.08 --> 5485.8
is Guess How Count Dracula

5482.4 --> 5488.5599999999995
is killing us all yeah through [ __ ]

5485.8 --> 5491.6
climate change propaganda

5488.56 --> 5494.96
nonsense that's how he's doing

5491.6 --> 5494.96
it and

5495.52 --> 5501.4800000000005
hey who even cares at that point that

5499.119 --> 5503.96
he's supposedly a

5501.48 --> 5506.599999999999
descendant or flat the Impaler or

5503.96 --> 5509.679
something right who even cares about

5506.6 --> 5511.2390000000005
that in the face of what is just doing

5509.679 --> 5514.28
what is he just doing I think that's a

5511.239 --> 5516.759999999999
lot worse and that oh maybe his grand

5514.28 --> 5519.48
grand grand grand

5516.76 --> 5523.639
grandfather brutally tortured a bunch of

5519.48 --> 5525.239
invadors to keep them out yeah I don't

5523.639 --> 5528.159000000001
really I don't think that's even that

5525.239 --> 5531.199
bad I think flat the Impaler was

5528.159 --> 5534.839999999999
probably a pretty cool dude n not really

5531.199 --> 5538.638999999999
he was probably deranged but I

5534.84 --> 5540.679
mean thanks to that dude we have more

5538.639 --> 5543.28
white people in

5540.679 --> 5546.4800000000005
Europe guaranteed that that's because of

5543.28 --> 5549.119
that dude because of Vlad impor he was

5546.48 --> 5552.119
deranged

5549.119 --> 5554.199
psycho but he [ __ ] got the Invaders

5552.119 --> 5557.32
out he kept them out and that's

5554.199 --> 5558.36
why Eastern Europe is not all brown and

5557.32 --> 5562.04
all that

5558.36 --> 5566.04
sh really that's exactly why that is

5562.04 --> 5568.239
because of that guy so you know that's

5566.04 --> 5570.28
not the worst side of King Charles I I

5568.239 --> 5572.199
think it's like yeah why don't you

5570.28 --> 5573.599999999999

5580.639 --> 5586.32
grandfather's grave yeah who kept it all

5583.92 --> 5589.679

5832.8 --> 5838.84
it

5835.52 --> 5843.1990000000005
right much rather stick to interesting

5838.84 --> 5843.1990000000005
subjects like what I was talking about

5848.32 --> 5850.799999999999
the great

5851.199 --> 5858.0
transformation from Roman Empire to

5854.52 --> 5861.76
Catholic Church rewriting history to

5858.0 --> 5866.4
Helio Centrist mind control enforcement

5861.76 --> 5867.96
derailing of God to a complete death

5866.4 --> 5870.879999999999
death

5867.96 --> 5873.52
cult all the all the world's problems

5870.88 --> 5877.08
are humans

5873.52 --> 5878.88
existing and that's where they're at now

5877.08 --> 5881.88
and

5878.88 --> 5881.88
from

5882.8 --> 5887.8
soldiers two priests two

5893.719 --> 5897.679
Bankers not sold on bloodline stuff no

5896.52 --> 5900.719
no

5897.679 --> 5901.76
no now the bloodline stuff is kind of n

5900.719 --> 5905.56
that's like

5901.76 --> 5907.4800000000005
that's the old nobility myth and it does

5905.56 --> 5911.360000000001
work to a

5907.48 --> 5911.36
degree until it stops

5911.679 --> 5916.96
working it's an old mechanism that's

5914.48 --> 5919.239
just kind of been there for a long time

5916.96 --> 5922.199
it's because of it's being because it

5919.239 --> 5925.08
was accepted because the idea of it was

5922.199 --> 5930.119
acceptable to people that they would

5925.08 --> 5933.119
allow themselves to be ruled by such

5930.119 --> 5933.119
groups

5936.92 --> 5942.719
so if I get 500 I'm going to go back and

5939.4 --> 5945.28
let them treat me like [ __ ] uh well not

5942.719 --> 5947.88
Neil Neil can go [ __ ] himself he can go

5945.28 --> 5950.719
just mumbling and complaining for

5947.88 --> 5953.92
another few months I don't give a

5950.719 --> 5955.88
[ __ ] he can't get his his own act

5953.92 --> 5957.679
together and get a grip on his own damn

5955.88 --> 5959.96
mouth then that's his [ __ ] problem I

5957.679 --> 5959.96
don't

5960.04 --> 5965.199
care

5962.84 --> 5967.8
I'm just saying hey you want me back 500

5965.199 --> 5971.28
bucks if I get 500 bucks I'm going to

5967.8 --> 5973.52
come back and then I don't I won't care

5971.28 --> 5976.08
as much if somebody's going to be angry

5973.52 --> 5979.2390000000005
with me I mean some of them are going to

5976.08 --> 5982.599
be angry with me I don't care it's too

5979.239 --> 5984.839999999999
bad I'm expecting that like right in the

5982.599 --> 5987.08
beginning oh they were all so very nice

5984.84 --> 5989.76
oh what is just this and and and

5987.08 --> 5991.159
eventually they're going to be like [ __ ]

5989.76 --> 5995.08
you Arwin then if you're not going to

5991.159 --> 5998.839999999999
come back I expect that yeah when I

5995.08 --> 6000.4
started this $500 euro thing I wasn't

5998.84 --> 6001.28
expecting that was going to succeed it's

6000.4 --> 6004.28
a

6001.28 --> 6009.5199999999995
challenge I don't expect it's going to

6004.28 --> 6009.5199999999995
work because I don't think it it's

6017.639 --> 6024.04
real I'm sure I'm fed up H very funny

6021.8 --> 6028.1990000000005
yeah but no I don't let Neil treat me

6024.04 --> 6031.04
like that ever not even when I was

6028.199 --> 6033.44
there I'll just keep talking [ __ ] about

6031.04 --> 6035.32
him until he shuts the [ __ ] up because

6033.44 --> 6039.32
that's the only thing you need to

6035.32 --> 6043.4
do Neil shut the [ __ ]

6039.32 --> 6046.4
up no exceptions don't don't talk like

6043.4 --> 6049.119
that don't push like that ever ever in

6046.4 --> 6049.119
my direction

6049.92 --> 6052.92
ever

6057.159 --> 6064.638999999999
I don't need to do anything

6061.599 --> 6068.360000000001
ever I don't need to hear that coming

6064.639 --> 6073.2390000000005
out of your mouth for any reason ever

6068.36 --> 6074.5199999999995
you hear me Neil ever never ever I don't

6073.239 --> 6077.598999999999
need to do

6074.52 --> 6079.84
anything coming out of your mouth

6077.599 --> 6082.88
ever not one

6079.84 --> 6086.159000000001
time so don't do

6082.88 --> 6090.52
that I'm just going to kick you

6086.159 --> 6095.638999999999
out [ __ ] all over you cut you off that's

6090.52 --> 6095.639
what I will do when you try that [ __ ] so

6108.36 --> 6112.839999999999
don't right

6116.28 --> 6119.8
right but my point is is

6120.84 --> 6124.56
that it's going to be what it's going to

6122.84 --> 6126.679
be I'm going to do my show I'm going to

6124.56 --> 6131.2390000000005
be really doing it well and I'm going to

6126.679 --> 6136.639
have all my energy just for me doing

6131.239 --> 6141.28
that yeah no more 4 to8 hours spending

6136.639 --> 6145.159000000001
it on fed and guys and it was great I

6141.28 --> 6147.5199999999995
mean it was kind of fun but yeah I'm in

6145.159 --> 6149.92
debt because of that [ __ ] because I gave

6147.52 --> 6154.679
it my all expected that there would be

6149.92 --> 6154.679
some something coming my way it

6156.04 --> 6159.5199999999995
didn't yeah it

6160.32 --> 6164.759999999999
didn't I seem to be regarded as just a

6163.199 --> 6168.919999999999
tiny little

6164.76 --> 6171.320000000001
minor add-on really I mean in words you

6168.92 --> 6172.88
can all you're very eloquent right fed

6171.32 --> 6176.08
members can be very eloquent in

6172.88 --> 6178.8
describing how what a great influence

6176.08 --> 6181.08
I'm I'm having on fed how important it's

6178.8 --> 6185.2390000000005
all very complimentary yeah but in

6181.08 --> 6188.92
reality no no it

6185.239 --> 6188.919999999999
isn't I don't think

6189.679 --> 6195.639
so you're all been very good at like

6192.88 --> 6198.1990000000005
keeping me relatively emotionally stable

6195.639 --> 6201.119
and hanging around and all but yeah I'm

6198.199 --> 6205.5199999999995
not getting anything out of it so going

6201.119 --> 6209.639
to now spend all that energy every day

6205.52 --> 6211.719
on this instead and growing my platform

6209.639 --> 6214.119
and my

6211.719 --> 6216.84
audience and actually

6214.119 --> 6218.239
growing growing more yeah I'm getting

6216.84 --> 6219.92
more

6218.239 --> 6223.5199999999995
viewers

6219.92 --> 6229.2390000000005
now and not just in in the rage win

6223.52 --> 6229.2390000000005
video my viewership has almost

6229.679 --> 6232.679
doubled

6247.04 --> 6255.5199999999995
what oh hey yeah thanks Brian Johnson

6252.44 --> 6255.5199999999995
for that gift I

6256.92 --> 6263.28
guess it's sometimes very hard for me to

6259.679 --> 6263.28
figure out whether you are troll or

6265.08 --> 6272.44
not but I appreciate

6268.88 --> 6276.1990000000005
that you also found me through F yeah I

6272.44 --> 6278.5599999999995
know yeah well now people can just find

6276.199 --> 6281.119
me through other things hey I go over

6278.56 --> 6285.04
the place I advertise myself wherever I

6281.119 --> 6287.199
go in a chat I talk the way I talk I get

6285.04 --> 6292.56
really informative I get

6287.199 --> 6292.5599999999995
like hyper effective communication

6293.84 --> 6299.32
like now I'm doing a show right I'm like

6296.679 --> 6303.08
reflecting back on you I'm I'm carrying

6299.32 --> 6305.5599999999995
the line here but that's not even how I

6303.08 --> 6309.08
function optimally where I function

6305.56 --> 6311.04
optimally is when somebody else is is

6309.08 --> 6312.76
doing that and when somebody else is

6311.04 --> 6314.0
thrwing the line having the show having

6312.76 --> 6317.04
a

6314.0 --> 6320.08
conversation and I don't have to do that

6317.04 --> 6321.8
it's like they choose the subject I

6320.08 --> 6325.639
don't have to choose the subject they

6321.8 --> 6329.96
choose it when that happens then I can

6325.639 --> 6333.1990000000005
like get just like 10 times higher

6329.96 --> 6335.679
processing rate in relation to it it's a

6333.199 --> 6337.919999999999
thing it it happens it's a a weird

6335.679 --> 6340.599
unique talent that I

6337.92 --> 6345.0
have where if I do something myself yeah

6340.599 --> 6346.8
I can do it decently well if I'm like

6345.0 --> 6350.8
being secondary

6346.8 --> 6353.679
or not the one Towing the line then

6350.8 --> 6356.8
whatever they bring up I can like roll

6353.679 --> 6359.639
out giant amounts of very well put

6356.8 --> 6361.400000000001
together text and information and it

6359.639 --> 6364.08
just happens it just comes out of me

6361.4 --> 6367.28
like a fountain just explodes it does

6364.08 --> 6369.96
not happen like that when I'm the one on

6367.28 --> 6372.28
my show Towing the line unless I like

6369.96 --> 6375.28
get really inspired but it doesn't just

6372.28 --> 6378.5599999999995
happen continually like when I'm in

6375.28 --> 6381.759999999999
other people's chats and

6378.56 --> 6384.400000000001
inspired like my output the quality of

6381.76 --> 6387.320000000001
my output is like four to 10 times as

6384.4 --> 6391.32
good even as when I'm on my own

6387.32 --> 6395.32
show it's like I'm able to formulate my

6391.32 --> 6397.239
ideas even better than when I'm doing my

6395.32 --> 6401.239
show

6397.239 --> 6403.5599999999995
live and that is just my presence There

6401.239 --> 6405.199
is almost a form of advertisement

6403.56 --> 6407.679
because people read that and they're

6405.199 --> 6411.638999999999
like wow you said that really

6407.679 --> 6414.2390000000005
well they do and some people get really

6411.639 --> 6416.719
jealous and then say that I'm an agent

6414.239 --> 6419.5599999999995
the GU like CIA or something like why

6416.719 --> 6421.52
because I'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ] because

6419.56 --> 6424.400000000001
I can say things that are actually well

6421.52 --> 6424.400000000001
formulated and

6428.48 --> 6437.5199999999995
interesting yeah joking but

6432.199 --> 6442.32
uh yeah I can advertise people know I'm

6437.52 --> 6442.320000000001
here famous and infamous

6446.28 --> 6452.119
and hey I was a part of fed of the

6448.679 --> 6455.28
greatest developments that was all

6452.119 --> 6457.28
there my voice is in

6455.28 --> 6459.759999999999
there I don't think they're going to

6457.28 --> 6461.5199999999995
like edit me out for whatever reason

6459.76 --> 6465.320000000001
there's people still in there that have

6461.52 --> 6467.76
been on fed for like half a decade

6465.32 --> 6471.84
so doesn't really

6467.76 --> 6474.599
matter I don't think I need need fed for

6471.84 --> 6478.1990000000005
advertising my own

6474.599 --> 6480.92
channel but it would be kind of cool if

6478.199 --> 6483.96
I could eventually return there

6480.92 --> 6486.8
and continue to be part of it but it

6483.96 --> 6486.8
will require

6497.44 --> 6505.5199999999995
500 didn't BR I don't know

6501.199 --> 6508.04
does Bri make anti videos she make any

6505.52 --> 6508.040000000001
videos at

6508.239 --> 6514.159
all she have stupid [ __ ] aopl videos

6512.4 --> 6516.759999999999
on their main

6514.159 --> 6518.96
page every person that does that is a

6516.76 --> 6521.320000000001
piece of [ __ ]

6518.96 --> 6525.8
yeah yes she does

6521.32 --> 6525.799999999999
have anti-in videos good

6526.32 --> 6532.5199999999995
point looks like from the looks of it

6529.119 --> 6535.0
she's kind of an a W

6532.52 --> 6539.88
hunt yeah not very

6535.0 --> 6539.88
promising way too many ballards in your

6547.88 --> 6553.92
list so yeah

6550.56 --> 6553.92
this it's

6554.0 --> 6560.76
cute yeah Brian Johnson that's right

6558.639 --> 6563.56
Brian Johnson I Don't Care I don't care

6560.76 --> 6566.4800000000005
what the [ __ ] he is or she I don't

6563.56 --> 6568.8

6566.48 --> 6571.5599999999995
about me and I'll give oh

6568.8 --> 6574.1990000000005
membership just another stupid fan

6571.56 --> 6574.1990000000005
probably a

6582.04 --> 6587.92
[ __ ] there's now like sort of liking

6585.88 --> 6592.119
me because I'm not part of Nathan or

6587.92 --> 6592.119
whatever and I don't give a [ __ ]

6593.599 --> 6601.2390000000005
yeah I'm not going to accept

6597.28 --> 6603.44
trash in my chat because I'm separating

6601.239 --> 6603.44
with

6604.119 --> 6608.92
fed yeah my standards are not changing

6606.76 --> 6608.92
at

6611.32 --> 6617.119
all so if you actually want to be part

6613.88 --> 6620.96
of my chat on the long

6617.119 --> 6623.239
run just don't be a stupid troll

6620.96 --> 6627.4
and if all possible like delete your

6623.239 --> 6632.159
stupid anti-ar videos nobody gives a

6627.4 --> 6632.159
[ __ ] it's just gross and

6634.239 --> 6638.4
stupid right it's going to make it kind

6636.239 --> 6640.28
of hard for me to justify having any

6638.4 --> 6641.96
kind of positive communication with you

6640.28 --> 6645.199
when you have that kind of crap on your

6641.96 --> 6645.199
channel right

6645.96 --> 6652.04
duper you got a little of that of fed

6649.599 --> 6652.04
there

6653.4 --> 6659.5599999999995
coer hey kevler big numers in yeah it's

6657.119 --> 6661.719
mostly just [ __ ] trolls

6659.56 --> 6663.76
though they're just hoping that I'm

6661.719 --> 6666.36
going to go crazy and kill myself or

6663.76 --> 6668.320000000001
something probably or betray myself them

6666.36 --> 6672.28
in super humiliated so they can send

6668.32 --> 6674.0
their demonic parasites back over to me

6672.28 --> 6676.159
that's what they hope they're just Hing

6674.0 --> 6677.96
for some vacancy so they can have their

6676.159 --> 6682.079
freaking

6677.96 --> 6685.159
demons in me again because they suck

6682.079 --> 6689.32
those people that extra viewer group

6685.159 --> 6693.28
that's demons that's demon possessed

6689.32 --> 6695.759999999999
people that are just like zombies like I

6693.28 --> 6697.92
need pain I need pain that's what

6695.76 --> 6700.2390000000005
they're looking for and hey I when I go

6697.92 --> 6702.32
Rin that's what they feel they feel the

6700.239 --> 6705.0
pain inside of me and they're addicted

6702.32 --> 6707.239
they're addicted to my pain so they just

6705.0 --> 6709.639
expect they're anticipating me to have

6707.239 --> 6711.32
more of that because of what happened

6709.639 --> 6713.96
recently because it was

6711.32 --> 6717.679
painful very painful that didn't happen

6713.96 --> 6721.28
again so they're all like like vampires

6717.679 --> 6723.32
hoping to suck up the blood yeah well go

6721.28 --> 6726.599
[ __ ] yourself and [ __ ] kill yourself

6723.32 --> 6726.599
yeah [ __ ] I don't need your

6736.119 --> 6741.88
viewership so uh but that that's what

6739.36 --> 6741.88
that is

6742.199 --> 6747.598999999999
and another part will be just people

6744.48 --> 6750.879999999999
that were genuinely getting sick of fed

6747.599 --> 6753.0
the attitude the energy that goes around

6750.88 --> 6755.8
there it can be very negative and then

6753.0 --> 6758.4
it they don't stop

6755.8 --> 6761.88
it they don't stop the

6758.4 --> 6761.879999999999
negativity and that's

6765.52 --> 6771.719
terrible and they might be like oh yeah

6768.56 --> 6773.360000000001
cool so now it's just full Arwin and

6771.719 --> 6775.52
there might be people that are like yeah

6773.36 --> 6778.799999999999
that are really happy that I'm breaking

6775.52 --> 6781.119000000001
up like that cuz they really did just

6778.8 --> 6783.400000000001
enjoy my

6781.119 --> 6786.92
show and me

6783.4 --> 6789.679
not always referencing Nathan with

6786.92 --> 6791.88
everything and all that because they

6789.679 --> 6794.36
might just not like him because of how

6791.88 --> 6794.36
he does his

6798.76 --> 6801.76
shows

6803.239 --> 6807.199
hope you take off two Realms I

6809.599 --> 6814.04
what

6811.199 --> 6815.638999999999
no no it's just I'm going to just do

6814.04 --> 6817.88
myself I'm going to be strong and I'm

6815.639 --> 6820.639
going to be very effective I'm

6817.88 --> 6822.52
GNA I'm going to basically aim to be

6820.639 --> 6826.079
just as awesome as Owen Benjamin it's

6822.52 --> 6829.56
not it's a a standard I'll never achieve

6826.079 --> 6832.88
I expect not like that anyway I mean he

6829.56 --> 6836.0
is he the way he does it that's his way

6832.88 --> 6839.119
and there are flaws about it that I find

6836.0 --> 6843.28
absolutely unacceptable if it were to be

6839.119 --> 6846.199
me it's acceptable for him because every

6843.28 --> 6847.599
person has to have weaker sides and then

6846.199 --> 6851.159
that creates

6847.599 --> 6854.599
character in the whole of it it's not my

6851.159 --> 6858.679
weakness though so I will be a different

6854.599 --> 6861.52
person but I want to be just as

6858.679 --> 6863.1990000000005
strong

6861.52 --> 6865.599
not an Owen fan yeah don't have to be an

6863.199 --> 6868.759999999999
Owen fan hey not

6865.599 --> 6871.2390000000005
everybody can handle

6868.76 --> 6875.56
that

6871.239 --> 6875.5599999999995
right because that's usually the

6886.28 --> 6890.4
reason right hey Owen's not perfect

6888.8 --> 6895.679
either I mean

6890.4 --> 6898.119
his flat earthing is meh he's it's like

6895.679 --> 6900.28
gradually slowly getting better and he

6898.119 --> 6902.719
is very consistent at it though he's

6900.28 --> 6905.04
like yeah screw the globers they're not

6902.719 --> 6905.04
they're

6906.679 --> 6911.56
idiots

6908.48 --> 6914.718999999999
but I mean the level of advancement in

6911.56 --> 6917.2390000000005
his understanding about it you still got

6914.719 --> 6917.2390000000005
a way to

6917.28 --> 6922.28
go and it's not going to get that way if

6920.199 --> 6925.079
he keeps hanging around David Weiss and

6922.28 --> 6925.079
wits it all the

6938.0 --> 6941.119
[Music]

6946.0 --> 6955.079
time Owen hangs with Ved yeah yeah yes

6949.8 --> 6958.84
he does and he played that video that QE

6955.079 --> 6962.28
gave like this massive like five episode

6958.84 --> 6965.52
treatment he played that video and then

6962.28 --> 6968.04
said that wit it brilliant yeah that

6965.52 --> 6970.599
happened and then right after that he

6968.04 --> 6972.28
played like a full uninterrupted clip of

6970.599 --> 6975.84
Nathan Oakley talking about second law

6972.28 --> 6975.84
of Thermodynamics and our space is

6978.52 --> 6985.0
fake but he does say that wit it is

6981.88 --> 6988.679
brilliant and he's an ether [ __ ] like

6985.0 --> 6992.96
that he's literally guzzling all the Ken

6988.679 --> 6994.92
wheeler hor [ __ ] from wit it he's he's

6992.96 --> 6996.719
spelled he's spelled by it and he

6994.92 --> 6999.28
doesn't see it he doesn't see it's

6996.719 --> 6999.28
absolute

7000.84 --> 7005.88
crap and that's why I'm saying like oh

7003.8 --> 7008.56
Owen you're so brilliant at physics no

7005.88 --> 7011.4800000000005
you're [ __ ] not I don't give a [ __ ]

7008.56 --> 7014.679
how much you're going to try to Bluff it

7011.48 --> 7014.678999999999
you're not good at

7015.48 --> 7021.799999999999
it and if what's rolling out of you is

7018.52 --> 7024.119000000001
your wife's standard and not just your

7021.8 --> 7026.28
own then your wife's not good at it

7024.119 --> 7030.119
either like I don't care what the [ __ ]

7026.28 --> 7030.119
you say or Claim about

7037.88 --> 7042.1990000000005
it right

7040.32 --> 7044.0
he's just

7042.199 --> 7048.5599999999995
doing

7044.0 --> 7052.0
very outdated trains of thought about it

7048.56 --> 7053.719
but he's also in between that also

7052.0 --> 7056.159
catching on to some Advanced more

7053.719 --> 7058.28
advanced arguments it's just still

7056.159 --> 7060.879999999999
behind I mean there's no reason to be

7058.28 --> 7063.599
that behind on your reasoning other than

7060.88 --> 7066.599
you don't actually really care that

7063.599 --> 7068.400000000001
much and you're just updating based on

7066.599 --> 7070.32
whatever is shoved in your face by the

7068.4 --> 7072.36
people closest to you

7070.32 --> 7075.0
which in this case is freaking David

7072.36 --> 7078.159
Wise and wit it that are in his telegram

7075.0 --> 7080.36
chat always trying to like oh oh I'm

7078.159 --> 7084.5199999999995
here I'm so special I'm I'm the flat

7080.36 --> 7084.5199999999995
earther oh

7086.32 --> 7089.88
yeah so

7090.36 --> 7095.96
yeah I mean if I like I can't get in

7093.44 --> 7099.04
telegram that's the stupid thing about

7095.96 --> 7101.28
it it literally there's a weird block

7099.04 --> 7104.8
like am

7101.28 --> 7107.88
incapable of of activating Telegram in

7104.8 --> 7107.88
any way it's

7113.599 --> 7117.8
weird because if I would then I would

7116.52 --> 7119.719
have

7117.8 --> 7124.0
joined Owen

7119.719 --> 7127.28
Benjamin's stuff like years ago years

7124.0 --> 7129.32
ago but I can't because I can't get in

7127.28 --> 7132.159
telegram it's completely permanently

7129.32 --> 7134.5199999999995
locked off for me it just oh you want to

7132.159 --> 7136.04
get in oh we just send the tele just

7134.52 --> 7138.119000000001
we'll send a code to the telephone

7136.04 --> 7140.76
number that you fill in right there I

7138.119 --> 7142.598999999999
fill in the telephone number code sent

7140.76 --> 7148.76
it never arrives

7142.599 --> 7148.76
ever so literally 100% impossible to get

7148.84 --> 7154.96
in it's just cut

7151.96 --> 7154.96
off

7156.639 --> 7162.639
so you distance himself from this Arena

7163.8 --> 7170.96
no no he will not and that's not a smart

7167.8 --> 7174.639
move you don't you don't get to judge

7170.96 --> 7174.639
anything about Owen

7180.679 --> 7185.28
Kevlar yeah if you're going to say not

7183.079 --> 7189.679
an no and fan that's cool yet you don't

7185.28 --> 7192.079
get to say then what he should be doing

7189.679 --> 7194.4800000000005
because you obviously don't have a good

7192.079 --> 7196.5199999999995
feel for it you don't even appreciate

7194.48 --> 7198.638999999999
him so you don't get to tell anything

7196.52 --> 7200.719
about what he's going to or should be

7198.639 --> 7204.04
doing Kevlar

7200.719 --> 7206.639
yeah why not because it just makes you

7204.04 --> 7206.639
an arrogant

7213.88 --> 7218.76
[ __ ] you don't know what he should do

7216.599 --> 7221.0
or not you don't even like what he does

7218.76 --> 7224.599
so there's no point for you to say

7221.0 --> 7224.599
anything about what he should do or

7226.28 --> 7232.04
not the arena is filled with circular

7228.92 --> 7237.28
convention oh oh cool tell

7232.04 --> 7240.119
me an arena that isn't any any Arena

7237.28 --> 7240.119
that isn't

7241.119 --> 7248.119
cflar any anything out there whatever it

7246.67 --> 7251.119
[Music]

7248.119 --> 7251.119
is

7256.88 --> 7262.88
reality oh yes of

7259.599 --> 7266.639
course CU that's a

7262.88 --> 7270.1990000000005
subject not just a

7266.639 --> 7272.96
word right because we talk about reality

7270.199 --> 7276.719
we talk about no those

7272.96 --> 7281.04
are clarifications it's not a subject

7276.719 --> 7281.04
yeah reality truth not a subject

7286.4 --> 7289.638999999999
something like Comet

7298.239 --> 7305.759999999999
what natural law reality

7302.52 --> 7308.320000000001
right well that is a part of it like

7305.76 --> 7310.4400000000005
that's physics natural law that's

7308.32 --> 7312.28
physics yeah have to understand it to

7310.44 --> 7315.598999999999
really get it and then once you really

7312.28 --> 7321.0
get it then all the misunderstandings

7315.599 --> 7322.4800000000005
and make shift solutions to ideas about

7321.0 --> 7325.52
space

7322.48 --> 7328.678999999999
and balls and all that

7325.52 --> 7329.84
yeah if you just know natural law then

7328.679 --> 7332.4400000000005
you can

7329.84 --> 7334.88
automatically say with good backing like

7332.44 --> 7337.159
no no to that no to that no to that no

7334.88 --> 7337.159000000001
to

7337.199 --> 7340.96
that yeah

7341.32 --> 7344.88
but that's all within the

7347.36 --> 7350.5599999999995
arena the

7352.04 --> 7359.92
context like natural law doesn't mean

7355.719 --> 7363.36
anything unless it has a function to

7359.92 --> 7365.32
disprove things that make it impossible

7363.36 --> 7367.799999999999
that natural law makes

7365.32 --> 7369.799999999999
impossible now we have the context yeah

7367.8 --> 7372.119000000001
that's Flat Earth

7369.8 --> 7374.76
in the context of Flat Earth natural law

7372.119 --> 7377.0
becomes very prominent and important

7374.76 --> 7380.92
because it proves how certain things

7377.0 --> 7382.239
cannot be that's within the context of

7380.92 --> 7385.1990000000005
Flat

7382.239 --> 7388.04
Earth if you scrap the Flat Earth out of

7385.199 --> 7390.5599999999995
it it doesn't mean anything to anybody

7388.04 --> 7393.199
it's just like oh yeah that's something

7390.56 --> 7397.2390000000005
whatever some Physics thing it's not

7393.199 --> 7399.36
going to do anything people won't then

7397.239 --> 7401.0
really figure it out what it is what it

7399.36 --> 7403.199
means and the implications are yeah you

7401.0 --> 7407.639
got to need a context for

7403.199 --> 7407.638999999999
that and that context is Flat

7423.119 --> 7426.119
Earth

7427.88 --> 7430.88
yeah

7441.639 --> 7448.679
should I'm not shut up akumu I'm not

7444.4 --> 7451.159
even attacking you like we don't care

7448.679 --> 7453.76
enough you don't need to feel threatened

7451.159 --> 7455.598999999999
I'm just making a general statement

7453.76 --> 7458.96
that's still responding to cflar

7455.599 --> 7461.4400000000005
statement that Owen Benjamin best stay

7458.96 --> 7465.96
out of the Arena which is asinine like

7461.44 --> 7465.96
no why the [ __ ] should he should

7468.679 --> 7478.159
he he's big out

7472.599 --> 7482.119000000001
there he is like spreading Flat Earth he

7478.159 --> 7484.36
is he's normalizing it to a degree like

7482.119 --> 7486.88
that's what a really big social media

7484.36 --> 7489.239
figure does they normalize what they

7486.88 --> 7493.119
talk about by him talking about it it

7489.239 --> 7496.718999999999
people will not be as freaked out

7493.119 --> 7499.48
or or as triggered because it's just

7496.719 --> 7502.199
become more normal that is very helpful

7499.48 --> 7506.5199999999995
to all of us right it doesn't have to

7502.199 --> 7506.5199999999995
have everything right just to achieve

7507.04 --> 7513.04
that so no is

7510.04 --> 7513.04
literally

7517.679 --> 7520.679
no

7521.199 --> 7526.32
he should not remove himself from this

7523.76 --> 7528.360000000001
arena there is literally no reason no

7526.32 --> 7531.84
good reason for him to do

7528.36 --> 7534.159
that yeah and him not being good enough

7531.84 --> 7537.559
by our standards is not a good enough

7534.159 --> 7541.679
reason either yeah you don't get better

7537.559 --> 7541.679
by completely leaving something

7541.8 --> 7547.320000000001
Forever by staying out of it way you

7543.92 --> 7547.32
don't get better at that

7547.679 --> 7551.76
then

7549.28 --> 7554.559
yeah and not being perfect is the worst

7551.76 --> 7558.4400000000005
excuse ever not to do something because

7554.559 --> 7558.4400000000005
you can't get perfect if you never do

7577.599 --> 7580.599
it

7595.119 --> 7598.48
right so hey I appreciate it that Owen

7597.159 --> 7601.5199999999995
brings up Flat

7598.48 --> 7605.119
Earth because why it's a good

7601.52 --> 7608.639
opportunity for me to roll out my

7605.119 --> 7611.679
pristine gathered knowledge about it in

7608.639 --> 7614.719
in the chat when he does and then Owen

7611.679 --> 7616.2390000000005
might like roll it out okay and then he

7614.719 --> 7618.199
stumbles here and he gets something

7616.239 --> 7621.36
wrong and then just moves on hassle

7618.199 --> 7624.079
whatever and then uh roll something out

7621.36 --> 7627.639
right well while he's doing that I can

7624.079 --> 7631.558999999999
like give like the perfect Wikipedia

7627.639 --> 7633.76
cutout text to perfectly explain exactly

7631.559 --> 7635.719
what he was talking about the right way

7633.76 --> 7638.76
right there right then for everybody to

7635.719 --> 7640.159
get like it's an opportunity him talking

7638.76 --> 7642.2390000000005
about is

7640.159 --> 7644.598999999999
great because that gives me the

7642.239 --> 7647.44
opportunity to roll out the pristine

7644.599 --> 7651.0
knowledge about it and share that with

7647.44 --> 7654.36
everybody there and then like people

7651.0 --> 7656.679
like codington who in like all the chats

7654.36 --> 7658.36
might pick up on it he's a curious

7656.679 --> 7660.92
fellow he does actually look at what

7658.36 --> 7663.44
people say pick up on it and like hey

7660.92 --> 7666.679
this is actually like the best

7663.44 --> 7669.638999999999
explanation and then P copy it pass it

7666.679 --> 7671.159
on I don't even have to know about it

7669.639 --> 7673.2390000000005
information that I've said could

7671.159 --> 7676.638999999999
literally be passed on without them even

7673.239 --> 7678.919999999999
telling me and they just take that and

7676.639 --> 7681.639
talk about it and I don't even

7678.92 --> 7683.4
know like yeah it's that Arwin guy in

7681.639 --> 7686.92
the chat always he says interesting

7683.4 --> 7688.638999999999
things yeah I know and you can copy that

7686.92 --> 7690.679
and you can learn from it you can take

7688.639 --> 7692.559
that would be cool if I got a bit of

7690.679 --> 7694.2390000000005
credit every now and then says like oh I

7692.559 --> 7696.0
got another interesting thing from Arwin

7694.239 --> 7700.199
in the chat that would be cool if I'd

7696.0 --> 7703.88
heard that if Owen said that I don't

7700.199 --> 7706.159
think he will though but that's cool I

7703.88 --> 7706.159000000001
don't

7709.52 --> 7713.679
care

7711.04 --> 7717.239
right when it comes to Flat Earth I just

7713.679 --> 7720.1990000000005
really want people to get as much of it

7717.239 --> 7723.239
right as they can and it's never going

7720.199 --> 7727.879999999999
to be 100% we don't

7723.239 --> 7730.119
know 100% it's very seducing for a lot

7727.88 --> 7733.32
of people that that get into it to try

7730.119 --> 7735.28
to Fain the 100% And claim things that

7733.32 --> 7737.558999999999
they literally don't know and can't know

7735.28 --> 7740.44
yet and then still make claim on that

7737.559 --> 7740.4400000000005
and then hold on to

7745.199 --> 7750.4
it right it's like if I were to claim

7747.96 --> 7753.8
like yeah my I know exactly how this

7750.4 --> 7755.4
looping realm works right it's exactly

7753.8 --> 7757.639
like this and that and there's these

7755.4 --> 7759.719
Lands Beyond and I know because I saw it

7757.639 --> 7762.28
on a map once and not going to show that

7759.719 --> 7764.44
map every time because it's permanent

7762.28 --> 7767.159
this is exactly how the realm is with

7764.44 --> 7769.919999999999
the loop I know it because of absolutely

7767.159 --> 7771.5199999999995
no reason other than that I decided that

7769.92 --> 7775.52
I knew it and that's how I'm going to

7771.52 --> 7777.88
present it now yeah no I don't that's

7775.52 --> 7780.96
why I always keep it open like there's a

7777.88 --> 7782.92
certain border of where we know things

7780.96 --> 7785.8
and what we literally don't know beyond

7782.92 --> 7789.159
but what we could still figure out what

7785.8 --> 7791.639
could be and that's where I go it's like

7789.159 --> 7793.4
well this could be outside of there but

7791.639 --> 7796.639
also this could be outside of there or

7793.4 --> 7798.879999999999
nothing is outside of there or like it's

7796.639 --> 7801.96
entirely like that's why I've had all

7798.88 --> 7805.719
these different ideas on my

7801.96 --> 7808.639
show to consider and none of them have

7805.719 --> 7811.84
an actual claim as like this is it this

7808.639 --> 7813.52
is it for sure all of them just have

7811.84 --> 7816.079
like conditions

7813.52 --> 7818.4400000000005
falsifiability conditions like this is

7816.079 --> 7821.44
how you can find out whether this

7818.44 --> 7824.598999999999
scenario about what it is like out there

7821.44 --> 7824.598999999999
is true or

7825.48 --> 7831.839999999999
false right like what's the orientation

7829.44 --> 7834.5199999999995
of the Equator what is it really is it a

7831.84 --> 7838.0
straight line is it a curve is it a

7834.52 --> 7841.360000000001
circle that knowledge is absolutely

7838.0 --> 7843.88
Monument monumentally

7841.36 --> 7847.28
critical to gain a better understanding

7843.88 --> 7849.4400000000005
of like the range of options of what the

7847.28 --> 7853.96
realm is

7849.44 --> 7855.638999999999
monumentally important to know that and

7853.96 --> 7857.159
totally

7855.639 --> 7859.679
unaddressed

7857.159 --> 7861.5199999999995
totally yeah I still remember just a

7859.679 --> 7863.8
bunch of superficial bickering between

7861.52 --> 7866.159000000001
flat earthers and globers and they're

7863.8 --> 7868.679
like oh distance of the flight path and

7866.159 --> 7870.839999999999
like oh the globe is like it's a circle

7868.679 --> 7875.119
around the globe and the disc are like

7870.84 --> 7880.079
no it's a circle over a disc but none of

7875.119 --> 7883.32
neither of them have actually got real

7880.079 --> 7886.4
tangible measured evidence about what

7883.32 --> 7889.96
the equator orientation really

7886.4 --> 7894.48
is neither of them from the start nobody

7889.96 --> 7894.4800000000005
does I've never found any evidence about

7894.84 --> 7901.76
it is the equator a straight line it

7899.76 --> 7905.639
like oh straight line over the curve

7901.76 --> 7909.04
whatever the point is straight ahead is

7905.639 --> 7912.0
it a straight ahead line or is it a

7909.04 --> 7912.96
slightly curve does it curve over the

7912.0 --> 7916.4
Flat

7912.96 --> 7918.559
Earth what is it where's the measurement

7916.4 --> 7922.239
where's the the actual measured proof

7918.559 --> 7922.2390000000005
right nobody has this

7924.8 --> 7933.639
information and that information is

7928.84 --> 7933.639
necessary to proceed

7933.679 --> 7940.92
further as to how the realm is what it's

7937.76 --> 7940.92
really like other than

7941.599 --> 7946.88
flat but Ballers don't address it really

7944.679 --> 7950.1990000000005
other than just all presuppositional

7946.88 --> 7952.119
claims and flat earthers discour they do

7950.199 --> 7954.32
the same thing they just presuppose yeah

7952.119 --> 7956.32
of course it's a circle oh really what's

7954.32 --> 7958.48
the measured evidence oh the map yeah

7956.32 --> 7960.759999999999
that's a projection just like with the

7958.48 --> 7963.919999999999
ball it's also a projection yeah it

7960.76 --> 7966.719
doesn't prove it's a circle or it's a

7963.92 --> 7969.1990000000005
straight line where is the

7966.719 --> 7971.92
measurement where is isn't

7969.199 --> 7974.839999999999
any so we don't

7971.92 --> 7976.559
know we don't know we don't know whether

7974.84 --> 7979.4800000000005
the equator is a straight line or a

7976.559 --> 7981.84
circle we just get to see the map

7979.48 --> 7983.32
projections and the map projections

7981.84 --> 7986.159000000001
don't

7983.32 --> 7988.239
reveal whether it's a straight line or a

7986.159 --> 7990.719
circle they just

7988.239 --> 7993.48
don't because that's how projections

7990.719 --> 7997.4800000000005
work they don't reveal that it's just a

7993.48 --> 7999.36
projection so we don't have measured

7997.48 --> 8002.558999999999
evidence

7999.36 --> 8006.759999999999
and I really would love to get my hands

8002.559 --> 8009.4800000000005
on some measured evidence for that for

8006.76 --> 8009.4800000000005
the equator

8010.48 --> 8016.48
orientation feeding deer shoveling snow

8013.559 --> 8016.4800000000005
nice seing star

8019.88 --> 8024.8
Water contact Owen and make an interview

8022.84 --> 8026.96
with him I don't know how to freaking

8024.8 --> 8031.079000000001
interview

8026.96 --> 8031.079
him I

8032.92 --> 8039.2390000000005
duper like I'm not going to just i' need

8036.719 --> 8042.36
to interview more people I would need to

8039.239 --> 8045.598999999999
have other people on my show to like

8042.36 --> 8047.96
figure out how to even compose

8045.599 --> 8051.079
myself I can't just like

8047.96 --> 8053.84
do massive amounts of shows on my own

8051.079 --> 8056.199
and then suddenly get on with like a

8053.84 --> 8059.04
famous

8056.199 --> 8061.239
person like I don't like they wouldn't

8059.04 --> 8063.8
know how to compose themselves because

8061.239 --> 8066.119
they couldn't they don't have examples

8063.8 --> 8069.159000000001
of me one on-one with somebody else

8066.119 --> 8072.32
talking they don't know how I would be

8069.159 --> 8075.199
they need to see more of that before

8072.32 --> 8077.48
they know what I am and how I would be

8075.199 --> 8081.719
they need more examples so I would need

8077.48 --> 8085.4
more people on my show talking on Skype

8081.719 --> 8086.679
with me live to achieve that I'd need

8085.4 --> 8091.32
more

8086.679 --> 8093.2390000000005
guests and then I could logically send a

8091.32 --> 8095.679
request like hey we want to get

8093.239 --> 8097.799999999999
on and then they could check my channel

8095.679 --> 8099.639
and see like oh oh yeah yeah this is

8097.8 --> 8102.639
what he's talking about this is the

8099.639 --> 8106.2390000000005
subject and this is how he

8102.639 --> 8111.28
is when he talks with somebody else and

8106.239 --> 8111.28
then they can figure out an angle of

8116.8 --> 8119.8
approach

8120.119 --> 8125.119
right so hey you want to come on with me

8122.119 --> 8126.5199999999995
on my show talk about Flat Earth or

8125.119 --> 8130.88
something

8126.52 --> 8133.76
else that's good I accept contact me on

8130.88 --> 8135.92
Skype oh by the way talking about Skype

8133.76 --> 8139.360000000001
I also like

8135.92 --> 8139.36
reopened oh what's

8139.52 --> 8146.2390000000005
this

8142.28 --> 8148.0
oh yeah I reopened the early bird chat

8146.239 --> 8150.32
the Flat Earth early bird chat in in

8148.0 --> 8152.8
Skype which has been there for years I

8150.32 --> 8156.558999999999
just never really used it I threw a

8152.8 --> 8159.28
whole bunch of people in there too so

8156.559 --> 8161.52
that's outside of my shows a chat that

8159.28 --> 8165.199
you can commonly chat amongst one

8161.52 --> 8168.400000000001
another with if you want to be part of a

8165.199 --> 8171.839999999999
chat group specifically surrounding the

8168.4 --> 8174.04
early bird show outside of the live

8171.84 --> 8176.719
chats where you can communicate with

8174.04 --> 8178.36
other participants of my live chat

8176.719 --> 8181.559
typically

8178.36 --> 8181.558999999999
then add me on

8182.28 --> 8186.84
Skype that I get to know you I'm not

8184.599 --> 8189.52
just going to add some randoms there I

8186.84 --> 8191.559
would have to actually know you a bit

8189.52 --> 8194.92
then we can talk on Skype and then I can

8191.559 --> 8198.439
add you to that Skype group if you

8194.92 --> 8200.519
want right but for now I'm going to take

8198.439 --> 8202.04
a two-minute break and then I'll be

8200.519 --> 8206.679
right back and I'm probably going to run

8202.04 --> 8209.679
out the show so be right

8206.679 --> 8209.679
back

8236.599 --> 8239.599
for

8328.399 --> 8331.08
okay and I'm

8333.319 --> 8338.399
back you didn't know that what what did

8336.24 --> 8338.399
you

8344.88 --> 8348.24
know hello

8352.84 --> 8358.359
hello my Skype chat yeah add

8356.439 --> 8360.439
me

8358.359 --> 8362.559000000001
add me and I can get you

8360.439 --> 8364.960000000001
in there's already a whole bunch of

8362.559 --> 8364.96
people

8365.92 --> 8372.319
there got Adam mein in

8369.04 --> 8377.359
there chocolate Saiyan

8372.319 --> 8381.279999999999
clutch desan from a while ago chocolate

8377.359 --> 8383.719000000001
s Constance also while yeah is G is in

8381.28 --> 8383.719000000001
there

8384.76 --> 8392.72
Elijah Mitchell from Australia original

8388.439 --> 8395.439
drose Robin Stanley Samson now here we

8392.72 --> 8398.72
go again steamy traveler stez

8395.439 --> 8400.28
morrettes and Darth and some others that

8398.72 --> 8401.479
you probably don't know so yeah there's

8400.28 --> 8403.640000000001
a whole bunch of people in there it's

8401.479 --> 8405.96
not Super Active it's mostly here we go

8403.64 --> 8408.119999999999
again just blabbering and blabbering but

8405.96 --> 8411.119999999999
that's what she

8408.12 --> 8411.12
does

8416.359 --> 8419.359
h

8444.04 --> 8449.319000000001
I don't know

8446.319 --> 8449.319
why

8453.04 --> 8460.2
[ __ ] was his name again guy fiber outs I

8457.359 --> 8462.399000000001
don't know why he left the Skype group

8460.2 --> 8465.479000000001
though kind of disappointed I hoped he

8462.399 --> 8468.88
would hang around there maybe just hates

8465.479 --> 8468.88
the notifications I don't

8469.0 --> 8473.92
know I rarely see him in here anymore

8471.8 --> 8476.399
anyway I don't know maybe he just

8473.92 --> 8479.24
doesn't like me anymore maybe a too much

8476.399 --> 8479.24
rage win

8479.68 --> 8484.439
he'd still I see him hanging around fed

8482.08 --> 8484.439
all the

8504.56 --> 8511.0
timeing was sitting how we know where we

8508.0 --> 8511.0
are

8514.04 --> 8518.04
what it's

8518.64 --> 8524.319
yeah I agree it's crap I don't like it I

8523.2 --> 8527.640000000001
didn't like

8524.319 --> 8529.76
it but I mean it's it's literally no

8527.64 --> 8534.358999999999
there's literally no point for Nathan to

8529.76 --> 8536.16
even have Merl to communicate

8534.359 --> 8539.16
with

8536.16 --> 8539.16
serious

8558.28 --> 8565.960000000001
no shut up akum virus why would he be

8560.76 --> 8567.880000000001
yeah Nathan's not all well most his

8565.96 --> 8570.16
stuff he says is at

8567.88 --> 8574.199999999999
[ __ ] Akuma

8570.16 --> 8577.2
virus [ __ ] you for

8574.2 --> 8577.2
that

8577.359 --> 8582.28
seriously yeah Richard G gave one

8580.16 --> 8585.72
example that is actually like yeah that

8582.28 --> 8590.640000000001
kind of was me not good

8585.72 --> 8594.72
yeah he can do that because it's so

8590.64 --> 8598.76
rare yeah not most stuff he says that's

8594.72 --> 8601.519999999999
you being an allergic and repented

8598.76 --> 8604.92
Ballard yeah that's your unrepented

8601.52 --> 8604.92
Ballard that says

8605.24 --> 8612.319
that yeah a joke that's funny yeah

8608.68 --> 8614.279
unrepentant balart joke I know it's not

8642.12 --> 8647.92
joke smiley face who else here thinks

8645.68 --> 8650.0
that that's actually funny or a

8647.92 --> 8651.8
joke it's not even whether you think

8650.0 --> 8655.399
it's funny whether you actually think

8651.8 --> 8659.0
that it could be considered as a joke

8655.399 --> 8659.0
anybody in here

with most stuff he says smiley face do

8697.16 --> 8703.399
you think that that's a

8699.84 --> 8706.68
joke you think that that's like could be

8703.399 --> 8706.68
classified as a

8709.12 --> 8715.880000000001
joke I'm asking

8712.52 --> 8718.880000000001
you your honest

8715.88 --> 8718.88
opinion

8723.2 --> 8729.279
maybe AK believe yeah I'm sure but

8725.8 --> 8732.119999999999
that's not I'm not asking you as to like

8729.279 --> 8734.76
the Dynamics of akumu delusions I'm

8732.12 --> 8737.960000000001
asking you if that was actually a joke

8734.76 --> 8741.16
if if you read that and you say yeah

8737.96 --> 8741.16
that that was meant as a

8744.399 --> 8750.039999999999
joke like if somebody says that would

8747.439 --> 8753.720000000001
you regard that as being oh he he tried

8750.04 --> 8753.720000000001
to make a joke you think

8754.439 --> 8762.439
that that's right yeah I know Richard it

8758.439 --> 8764.960000000001
doesn't come off as a joke yeah yeah

8762.439 --> 8764.960000000001
because it

8773.04 --> 8779.84
isn't he just said oh I'm just being

8775.8 --> 8781.479
funny after you had the reflex ballart

8779.84 --> 8784.399
reflexes

8781.479 --> 8786.76
right oh it just made a joke no no it

8784.399 --> 8788.399
wasn't a joke it was a ball tart reflex

8786.76 --> 8791.84
you couldn't help yourself that's what

8788.399 --> 8793.72
that was and that's fine I just don't

8791.84 --> 8795.439
like that you didn't try to make an

8793.72 --> 8798.72
excuse like it's a joke when it's

8795.439 --> 8802.0
obviously not a

8798.72 --> 8803.479
joke it's not told as a joke it's not

8802.0 --> 8808.24
really

8803.479 --> 8811.358999999999
funny it's a a ballart reflex

8808.24 --> 8815.039999999999
an over exaggerated approach opinion

8811.359 --> 8816.84
push little thingy and then when you

8815.04 --> 8820.560000000001
realize oh [ __ ] I just had a ballart

8816.84 --> 8822.76
refle oh it was a joke oh yes sure sure

8820.56 --> 8825.399
it was Aon it's a

8822.76 --> 8827.52
joke the joke is that you actually think

8825.399 --> 8831.439
that we're going to buy

8827.52 --> 8831.439
that yeah that's the real

8835.72 --> 8842.519999999999
joke

8838.52 --> 8845.880000000001
but it's okay hey people have Bard

8842.52 --> 8847.880000000001
reflexes yeah I mean it's it is like a

8845.88 --> 8850.0
mental disorder you can't expect

8847.88 --> 8850.96
somebody to just never do that when they

8850.0 --> 8853.56
have

8850.96 --> 8856.319
it right it's just like people that have

8853.56 --> 8858.479
weird ticks like they have to switch the

8856.319 --> 8860.92
light on and off like five times every

8858.479 --> 8863.24
time they leave a room or something it's

8860.92 --> 8865.72
like yeah you can't then be surprised if

8863.24 --> 8868.92
they do that it's like yeah that's why

8865.72 --> 8871.8
it's a tick and so our Ballard reflex

8868.92 --> 8874.8
they can't help it they'll have to do it

8871.8 --> 8876.64
it's not even a a real conscious in the

8874.8 --> 8877.64
moment thing it's just it's something

8876.64 --> 8880.96
they got to

8877.64 --> 8883.24
do and I know how to recognize

8880.96 --> 8886.599999999999
it that's why I'm making a little bit of

8883.24 --> 8886.6
an item out of it right

8888.479 --> 8894.039999999999
now yeah yeah keep keep spinning it

8891.16 --> 8895.64
around kumu sure you're going to get

8894.04 --> 8898.640000000001
somewhere with

8895.64 --> 8898.64
that

8902.85 --> 8905.929
[Music]

8912.12 --> 8918.399000000001
maybe it was my flat Earth reflex Oh you

8915.2 --> 8920.640000000001
mean the instantaneous perfect analysis

8918.399 --> 8923.479
with references and Foundation that

8920.64 --> 8927.0
holds the test of time yeah if you want

8923.479 --> 8929.438999999998
to call that my flat Earth reflexes then

8927.0 --> 8929.439
yes

8943.72 --> 8949.56
definitely yeah this end yeah I'm sure

8946.52 --> 8949.560000000001
it's not true in your

8952.12 --> 8955.12
head

8955.52 --> 8958.52
yeah

8962.2 --> 8965.84
all right I think I'm going to round out

8963.56 --> 8970.08
the show it's getting kind of

8965.84 --> 8970.08
late gone for two and a half

8985.52 --> 8988.52
hours

8998.08 --> 9003.68
okay

8999.479 --> 9007.319
clammy right anyhow I hope you all had

9003.68 --> 9010.319
an interesting time today on my show I

9007.319 --> 9012.519999999999
think I was pretty fluid at least didn't

9010.319 --> 9015.439
have a lot of trouble like rolling into

9012.52 --> 9019.24
it cuz I was already kind of

9015.439 --> 9022.12
late certainly help it's great to have

9019.24 --> 9024.52
new coffee again I'm so happy that I got

9022.12 --> 9027.76
got I got coffee man I got coffee for a

9024.52 --> 9029.880000000001
while I feel so lucky that I can can

9027.76 --> 9033.04
drink that now

9029.88 --> 9035.679999999998
again thanks to the support that I've

9033.04 --> 9037.800000000001
been getting just for food and such

9035.68 --> 9040.880000000001
right and I got some fresh bread I mean

9037.8 --> 9044.88
the fresh organic

9040.88 --> 9047.88
spelt sour dough bread oh with like a

9044.88 --> 9051.8
baked egg on it and some May oh my God

9047.88 --> 9054.679999999998
it's it's like I'm poor but I get to eat

9051.8 --> 9054.679999999998
that which is

9055.12 --> 9061.6
like it's so weird man I feel like I'm a

9058.359 --> 9065.76
freaking poor hobo on one end but at the

9061.6 --> 9068.84
same time I also for a hobo eat like a

9065.76 --> 9072.6
king it's really bizarre how that works

9068.84 --> 9075.56
out but I'm just holding on to the the

9072.6 --> 9078.16
good side of that and just like yeah I I

9075.56 --> 9080.359
feel so lucky I'm so thankful to God

9078.16 --> 9083.399
that I can eat

9080.359 --> 9087.2
this that everything around me is

9083.399 --> 9089.439
arranged for me to be able to have this

9087.2 --> 9091.04
even though it would in general be

9089.439 --> 9094.16
regarded as like yeah that's poverty

9091.04 --> 9097.52
it's nothing but I still get to eat that

9094.16 --> 9099.92
great great food that is of a good

9097.52 --> 9102.92
quality and that I can still manage

9099.92 --> 9106.12
despite the poverty I mean it's I'm not

9102.92 --> 9109.479
going to get fat from it but I'm just so

9106.12 --> 9112.640000000001
happy happy that I still have

9109.479 --> 9114.24
that and I'm going to be like thankful

9112.64 --> 9117.319
for it

9114.24 --> 9118.68
actively not just as a virtual signal

9117.319 --> 9121.88
which is ridiculous why the hell would

9118.68 --> 9121.880000000001
you virtual signal to

9123.04 --> 9128.04
God he

9125.04 --> 9128.04
knows

9130.319 --> 9135.278999999999
anyway

9132.04 --> 9137.640000000001
right I'm going to round out the

9135.279 --> 9139.92
show most of the show was about the

9137.64 --> 9142.16
Roman Empire

9139.92 --> 9145.319
transformation how it roughly would have

9142.16 --> 9149.16
happened insights ideas about

9145.319 --> 9150.56
it and I really hope that people will

9149.16 --> 9153.68
think about it

9150.56 --> 9156.399
more like yeah no there's a thousand

9153.68 --> 9159.92
years missing and that like the

9156.399 --> 9162.479
implications are like all

9159.92 --> 9165.56
encompassing and it needs to be

9162.479 --> 9167.278999999999
processed we need to process what's real

9165.56 --> 9170.76
we need to process process how it really

9167.279 --> 9170.76
happen based on the

9172.399 --> 9177.399
evidence

9174.24 --> 9180.24
so it might take some more time but I

9177.399 --> 9183.319
think that eventually it will be figured

9180.24 --> 9187.0
out it might not even be that historical

9183.319 --> 9188.399
but it will it will fit things because

9187.0 --> 9191.64
if things are

9188.399 --> 9194.72
true then the information that reflects

9191.64 --> 9196.599999999999
that truth will fit and that's how you

9194.72 --> 9199.16
really know that's how you know even

9196.6 --> 9201.6
when you don't have literal historical

9199.16 --> 9203.84
pieces of super old paper that say it

9201.6 --> 9207.359
right or

9203.84 --> 9209.0
parchment it's real because it happened

9207.359 --> 9212.24
and then it

9209.0 --> 9214.08
fits even if you don't really have more

9212.24 --> 9217.68
direct evidence for

9214.08 --> 9220.72
it and that is important to realize that

9217.68 --> 9224.12
that that's logically the case and so I

9220.72 --> 9228.16
will always keep attempting to to do

9224.12 --> 9228.160000000002
that anyhow

9229.08 --> 9232.96
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

9231.04 --> 9235.319000000001
