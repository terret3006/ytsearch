good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

64.799 --> 69.64

much appreciated and it can always use

90.759 --> 99.799
the support so yeah any support would be

94.72 --> 103.2
great could actually kind of use some by

99.799 --> 105.68
now it's been a

103.2 --> 111.119
while

105.68 --> 114.56
right weather today sucks it

111.119 --> 117.32
it's totally clouded and it's

114.56 --> 118.84
raining dreary type of rain not hard

117.32 --> 121.36
rain

118.84 --> 125.399
but

121.36 --> 125.399
weather is not not

130.56 --> 136.44
great

133.28 --> 137.56
this at least the plants are getting

136.44 --> 140.239
some

137.56 --> 145.36
water cuz it's been kind of dry for a

140.239 --> 145.36
while so I guess they're they need

147.2 --> 151.76
it but uh yeah

155.239 --> 159.64000000000001
I'm just going to stay inside most of

157.4 --> 159.64000000000001
the

161.879 --> 169.72
day

164.4 --> 169.72
right so yeah starting a little late got

170.239 --> 174.59900000000002
distracted just reading some Rudolph

174.76 --> 182.879
Steiner and noticing very oddly how I

179.56 --> 187.36
have actually managed to

182.879 --> 189.959
read quite clearly and without

187.36 --> 193.4
distraction that was kind of odd not

189.959 --> 196.239
used to be able to do

193.4 --> 198.59900000000002
that so I think I'm going to like

196.239 --> 202.4
continue reading this

198.599 --> 205.56
book been sitting there for a while

202.4 --> 205.56
but is

207.72 --> 211.68
it slightly less than a

212.55 --> 218.36
[Music]

215.12 --> 221.4
third but it's been very fascinating

218.36 --> 221.4
these last few

223.36 --> 230.76000000000002
pages right

225.4 --> 230.76000000000002
anyhow it is Monday the 11th of March

236.12 --> 241.68
[Music]

238.68 --> 241.68
2024

244.4 --> 252.92000000000002
temperature is 8Â° C and 90% humidity

249.92 --> 252.92
70%

258.04 --> 262.68
precipitation right so it's just rainy

261.12 --> 265.68
day rainy

262.68 --> 265.68
Monday

268.6 --> 271.6
lovely

287.44 --> 290.12
actually be kind of

293.72 --> 298.56
hungry

295.75 --> 301.56
[Music]

298.56 --> 301.56
right

328.24 --> 332.52
right so there's some things I could

330.72 --> 338.44000000000005
talk

332.52 --> 338.44
about yes the issg shared a video

339.319 --> 347.36
link about some weird math

343.919 --> 351.24
guy but uh yeah it

347.36 --> 354.039
was I immed yeah I remember being that

351.24 --> 357.40000000000003
being brought up like a while

354.039 --> 359.52
ago and there's like issues with it like

357.4 --> 362.479
that are became very apparent to me very

359.52 --> 364.919
very quickly hello clutch first in chat

362.479 --> 364.919
good to see

365.12 --> 368.479
you how you

378.759 --> 382.36
doing where's that

384.8 --> 391.40000000000003
video Yeah Terrence

388.4 --> 391.4
Howard

392.56 --> 397.8
but I think that like the claims that he

395.16 --> 400.24
made were very weird in that video I

397.8 --> 403.479
don't know if anybody else watched

400.24 --> 406.72
it I did like repost it in the Flat

403.479 --> 409.24
Earth early word chat in

406.72 --> 412.84000000000003
Skype hey

409.24 --> 412.84000000000003
Mojo good to see

418.4 --> 421.4
you

425.12 --> 427.72
how you doing

430.8 --> 436.68
man I'm really hungry you know what I'm

434.479 --> 438.68
just going to I don't know if today's

436.68 --> 441.199
show is going to be a long show or not

438.68 --> 443.24
it might turn out like a long show

441.199 --> 445.199
eventually but I'm really hungry I'm

443.24 --> 447.40000000000003
going to put my Illuminati C on the oven

445.199 --> 447.40000000000003
right

448.319 --> 451.319
now

452.759 --> 457.56
targeted

455.479 --> 461.15999999999997
indivisible

457.56 --> 463.72
hey weren't you the guy that ask and

461.16 --> 466.72
receive was referencing

463.72 --> 468.24
yesterday said that you were banned but

466.72 --> 472.879
you

468.24 --> 475.08
weren't huh yeah welcome anyway I'll be

472.879 --> 475.08000000000004
right

478.319 --> 481.319
back

532.7 --> 535.909
[Music]

568.12 --> 573.5600000000001
uh you're hanging in

570.519 --> 575.9590000000001
there oh what's going on moo I gave you

573.56 --> 577.959
a wrench by the way since you're like a

575.959 --> 582.8
very long-term supporter

577.959 --> 585.0
and it's just that I well trust

582.8 --> 588.1999999999999
you don't really have to do anything

585.0 --> 588.2
with it don't

590.44 --> 597.2
worry

592.399 --> 602.04
okay I am the dragon Robert Duncan

597.2 --> 602.0400000000001
Asen Dragon comet what are you talking

603.839 --> 609.6800000000001
about anyway I guess welcome to the

607.079 --> 609.68
early word

617.72 --> 624.44
chat

620.6 --> 624.44
H what was I talking

625.32 --> 633.399
about yeah the video yesterday like one

628.32 --> 637.279
of his B and like that video is like

633.399 --> 637.279
really overplayed and hyped

637.88 --> 645.12
up and the whole point of it was like

642.279 --> 648.12
criticism to the banking system and how

645.12 --> 649.839
they calculate things and in that sense

648.12 --> 651.519
there is a point to

649.839 --> 656.72
it

651.519 --> 659.04
but in the main logical sense and I I

656.72 --> 661.48
talked to this uh I talked about this

659.04 --> 664.48
say with

661.48 --> 664.48
LSG

665.68 --> 670.079
is

667.959 --> 673.959
okay all

670.079 --> 673.959
right take it easy

674.72 --> 680.24
there is that there's like a pretty

677.76 --> 684.0
severe category

680.24 --> 687.16
error I think it's a category error

684.0 --> 692.72
because in that video they're basically

687.16 --> 696.639
claiming one time one isn't one it's

692.72 --> 699.0400000000001
two which is kind of preposterous and

696.639 --> 702.0
supposedly there's philosophical backing

699.04 --> 704.48
to it and all that but I mean it is

702.0 --> 706.32
literally

704.48 --> 709.0790000000001
nonsense

706.32 --> 710.6800000000001
because they were

709.079 --> 714.12
equating

710.68 --> 717.6389999999999
numbers in multiplications with

714.12 --> 720.04
objects but yeah that's just completely

717.639 --> 721.48
illogical because like yeah you could

720.04 --> 725.7199999999999
split up an

721.48 --> 729.2
object or like a dollar in

725.72 --> 732.5600000000001
cents but then if you multiply that that

729.2 --> 736.279
number of the dollar one cent of a

732.56 --> 740.5999999999999
dollar and it becomes less but this is

736.279 --> 740.6
just a gigantic category error

741.12 --> 747.279
because an object isn't a number you

745.16 --> 750.519
can't multiply

747.279 --> 753.0
something with an object object that's

750.519 --> 756.88
not how multiplication

753.0 --> 760.56
works like at all so it was basically a

756.88 --> 764.12
very rudimentary category error that

760.56 --> 764.1199999999999
perpetuated that entire

765.48 --> 773.6800000000001
idea right you can multiply an

770.399 --> 776.279
object by a number you can multiply a

773.68 --> 780.04
number by a number but you can't

776.279 --> 784.16
multiply an object by an object

780.04 --> 786.56
it's like what's a rock times a glass of

784.16 --> 788.88
water well all depends on if you're

786.56 --> 790.88
going to regard the glass of water as a

788.88 --> 795.959
collection of

790.88 --> 799.88
droplets uh no it's just

795.959 --> 802.4799999999999
error this is not a logical inquiry and

799.88 --> 805.76
that was basically that summarizes the

802.48 --> 808.279
issue with the entire video and there is

805.76 --> 811.04
no solution to that category you can't

808.279 --> 814.92
just say what well if you multiply one

811.04 --> 817.5999999999999
object by another object it's just two

814.92 --> 821.04
no it's just a category ER and it makes

817.6 --> 823.1990000000001
no damn sense to even argue that at all

821.04 --> 825.4399999999999
and hey maybe the banking system does

823.199 --> 826.959
actually apply that category error in

825.44 --> 829.5600000000001
their own grabble

826.959 --> 833.6389999999999
trickery so as a

829.56 --> 836.92
criticism on how banking does things

833.639 --> 840.04
sure but there is no mathematical logic

836.92 --> 841.759
behind it at all

840.04 --> 845.36
like

841.759 --> 848.839
none so that addresses that

845.36 --> 848.839
video anybody

850.36 --> 855.6
carot do I still need donations yeah yes

854.0 --> 859.88
I

855.6 --> 863.5600000000001
do there always welcome

859.88 --> 866.12
right preferably

863.56 --> 869.3599999999999
PayPal use the link in the description

866.12 --> 870.759
box any support would be great

869.36 --> 874.639
I'm using

870.759 --> 874.639
it exclusively for

877.639 --> 881.399
food so

885.959 --> 888.959
sure

889.68 --> 894.279
uh just let me know if you'll do it and

892.399 --> 898.12
I'll check my PayPal and

894.279 --> 899.8
everything right but other than that I

898.12 --> 902.0
just like to have have conversation with

899.8 --> 902.0
the

907.079 --> 910.3199999999999
chat all

915.44 --> 920.759
right so that addresses that video I

918.04 --> 923.4399999999999
didn't check out clear's video yet

920.759 --> 923.44
didn't get to

925.0 --> 930.199
it the insane Arctic balloon Expedition

928.0 --> 933.12
video looked very interesting I just

930.199 --> 933.12
didn't get to watch

937.6 --> 944.0400000000001
it but

940.36 --> 945.6800000000001
yeah the Terrence Howard video is very

944.04 --> 948.4399999999999
easily

945.68 --> 950.8
addressed by the basic statement you can

948.44 --> 952.8000000000001
multiply a number with a number you can

950.8 --> 955.5999999999999
multiply an object with a number but you

952.8 --> 959.4799999999999
cannot multiply an object with an

955.6 --> 961.9200000000001
object that's it the entire premise is

959.48 --> 966.44
just completely

961.92 --> 968.56
done H that's really all you need to say

966.44 --> 971.72
and then there's no more point in

968.56 --> 971.7199999999999
continuing that

972.16 --> 977.399
video it's kind of embarrassing that a

974.6 --> 981.0790000000001
lot of people aren't seeing

977.399 --> 984.48
that but it could be that the video is

981.079 --> 987.519
feeding off people's inability to

984.48 --> 990.519
realize that math is not

987.519 --> 990.519
reality

990.92 --> 997.8
like even if you multiply an

993.72 --> 1001.12
object you then categorize the

997.8 --> 1005.12
object basically you have to create an

1001.12 --> 1008.04
extract of the physical and turn it into

1005.12 --> 1008.04
math for

1008.44 --> 1017.1600000000001
multiplication because objects

1012.44 --> 1019.5600000000001
aren't like isn't math information by

1017.16 --> 1022.0
default see

1019.56 --> 1023.8389999999999
it just isn't an object

1022.0 --> 1026.48
is an

1023.839 --> 1029.559
object it's

1026.48 --> 1031.839
material how you regard it is all up to

1029.559 --> 1034.439
you right do you regard it as oh it's a

1031.839 --> 1037.799
part of a hole or it's a

1034.439 --> 1039.4
whole collection of little things it's

1037.799 --> 1041.6399999999999
like oh well the object you could

1039.4 --> 1043.799
technically consider that a lot of

1041.64 --> 1045.5590000000002
different molecules so is the number

1043.799 --> 1049.24
then the amount of

1045.559 --> 1051.36
molecules or is the number just how you

1049.24 --> 1054.039
regard the object do you regard the

1051.36 --> 1058.1599999999999
object as one thing then you're going to

1054.039 --> 1061.4
use one in the multiplication so that's

1058.16 --> 1061.4
basically that

1066.24 --> 1070.44
issue so there I addressed

1074.6 --> 1080.3999999999999
it

1077.08 --> 1080.3999999999999
uh that was

1090.68 --> 1093.829
[Music]

1107.32 --> 1110.32
quick

1119.36 --> 1126.8799999999999
so targeted indivisible are you going

1122.64 --> 1129.5590000000002
to actually do something it's

1126.88 --> 1133.44
been six minutes since your seven

1129.559 --> 1133.44
minutes since your last comment

1137.32 --> 1142.08
there

1138.88 --> 1142.0800000000002
please don't forget to share the

1143.2 --> 1148.3600000000001
show this might be a typical dreary

1146.44 --> 1153.679
Monday but I

1148.36 --> 1156.4799999999998
am going to try to make it cool to

1153.679 --> 1158.64
entertain you I'm very clear-minded also

1156.48 --> 1163.6
I had

1158.64 --> 1163.6000000000001
like really really intense

1163.96 --> 1169.32
dreams actually I woke up this morning

1167.0 --> 1171.48
with that

1169.32 --> 1175.32
like heartbroken

1171.48 --> 1175.32
because I basically

1179.919 --> 1182.919
got

1183.679 --> 1192.0800000000002
yeah it got very close to my

1187.84 --> 1194.36
heart research Dragon Comet okay well

1192.08 --> 1196.4399999999998
I'll research the dragon Comet how much

1194.36 --> 1201.12
money do you

1196.44 --> 1201.1200000000001
need uh anything you can

1203.12 --> 1208.1589999999999
spare Dragon

1206.159 --> 1213.0
Comet

1208.159 --> 1213.0
okay Comet Dragon

1217.0 --> 1223.28
what okay I'm getting what looks like a

1220.12 --> 1223.28
bunch of Pokemon

1227.159 --> 1230.159
pictures

1232.76 --> 1238.48
so do you have any specific type of

1235.919 --> 1240.24
source you want me to look into this

1238.48 --> 1244.039
Dragon Comet you're talking about

1240.24 --> 1246.32
because Google searches are like yeah

wasted especially by newcomers that

1517.96 --> 1523.72
just act very

1521.08 --> 1525.72
arrogant yeah I'm willing to entertain

1523.72 --> 1528.64
OD things even things I've never heard

1525.72 --> 1531.2
before but it better actually about

1528.64 --> 1533.64
something I want just be set on some

1531.2 --> 1535.88
random Rabbit Trail that doesn't lead

1533.64 --> 1538.6000000000001
anywhere if you try to do that I will

1535.88 --> 1538.6000000000001
kick you the [Â __Â ]

1556.679 --> 1559.679
out

1563.0 --> 1572.039
right anyway I had two very intense

1568.159 --> 1572.0390000000002
dreams that were very

1576.88 --> 1581.7990000000002
interesting especially the second one

1579.12 --> 1581.799
was very

1584.2 --> 1590.0800000000002
intense a very expanded first one was

1587.96 --> 1593.3990000000001
kind of weird it was

1590.08 --> 1593.399
a yeah it

1593.799 --> 1599.9189999999999
was it's a dream that is very likely to

1597.159 --> 1601.72
be related with me uh kind of drinking a

1599.919 --> 1603.5590000000002
little bit too much mint tea right

1601.72 --> 1606.799
before going to

1603.559 --> 1608.799
bed when I woke up from that one I did

1606.799 --> 1611.12
have to like go to the

1608.799 --> 1613.96
toilet but it was like one of those

1611.12 --> 1616.6
types of Dreams which is really

1613.96 --> 1619.6000000000001
weird it was

1616.6 --> 1619.6
a

1619.88 --> 1625.3200000000002
a dream that was

1622.24 --> 1627.039
basically this

1625.32 --> 1632.0
apartment

1627.039 --> 1634.399
but altered I it's always amazes me when

1632.0 --> 1636.64
there's like an environment that has

1634.399 --> 1640.12
very a lot of similarities to a place I

1636.64 --> 1643.3200000000002
know but then there's alterations to it

1640.12 --> 1646.7199999999998
so it was basically like this place but

1643.32 --> 1650.2
the stairs were like way longer and

1646.72 --> 1654.279
different and I don't know like even

1650.2 --> 1658.6000000000001
where that came from also my dad was in

1654.279 --> 1661.6
the house but it was my dad

1658.6 --> 1663.48
younger and what was really weird which

1661.6 --> 1667.0
is definitely not the case

1663.48 --> 1670.799
anymore is that he was like he seemed to

1667.0 --> 1670.799
be like sort of a drunk or

1671.559 --> 1677.279
something because I was just

1674.64 --> 1678.0800000000002
like sneaking downstairs I don't even

1677.279 --> 1681.44
know

1678.08 --> 1681.4399999999998
why in the

1682.72 --> 1687.799
dark and then he came out of another

1688.44 --> 1693.48
room but he didn't turn on the light and

1690.88 --> 1696.44
that kind of creeped me

1693.48 --> 1699.3600000000001
out and came almost walking into me and

1696.44 --> 1701.96
I pushed him away with my feet he was

1699.36 --> 1702.9599999999998
like oh oh yeah I was just trying to get

1701.96 --> 1706.0
a

1702.96 --> 1708.32
beer very

1706.0 --> 1710.84
strange relatively short dream very

1708.32 --> 1714.1589999999999
strange I woke up like immediately after

1710.84 --> 1716.6
that and like oh I need to go to the

1714.159 --> 1718.88
bathroom it's just very strange these

1716.6 --> 1724.519
kinds of dreams and I'm not used to like

1718.88 --> 1724.519
dreams this elaborate like this Vivid

1725.44 --> 1731.44
anymore right but after that I had

1728.559 --> 1733.96
another dream which was way more

1731.44 --> 1736.48
elaborate was

1733.96 --> 1740.0
outside I thought at first that it might

1736.48 --> 1741.76
have been like the the the Dreamscape

1740.0 --> 1746.44
again of my old

1741.76 --> 1750.8799999999999
town but I couldn't really connect it

1746.44 --> 1750.88
up and what it basically was

1752.36 --> 1759.1589999999999
is I had discovered

1755.2 --> 1764.159
this place like a fair that happened it

1759.159 --> 1764.159
seemed like it was like newly built in a

1765.44 --> 1770.799
street and

1768.679 --> 1774.48
it was like themed in a certain way kind

1770.799 --> 1778.2
of odd though was had

1774.48 --> 1781.1200000000001
like in many way Jester

1778.2 --> 1784.0800000000002
theme very

1781.12 --> 1787.279
strange like I never have those types of

1784.08 --> 1791.48
dreams so it was like a fair with a lot

1787.279 --> 1793.96
of gesture themes very very odd but like

1791.48 --> 1796.0
what was so intense about it it was

1793.96 --> 1798.24
basically my

1796.0 --> 1802.679
ex coming to

1798.24 --> 1807.919
visit in like pretty awesome car and all

1802.679 --> 1807.919
that and it just was

1811.48 --> 1821.519
like yeah it sort of pulled me back

1817.799 --> 1824.9189999999999
into my memories of being in love with

1821.519 --> 1826.24
her very intense and when I woke up from

1824.919 --> 1831.0
that I

1826.24 --> 1834.519
felt really really nostalgic

1831.0 --> 1836.679
and because like all yeah that ex

1834.519 --> 1838.799
situation I mean 10 years ago I was

1836.679 --> 1840.64
completely heartbroken yeah it's that

1838.799 --> 1843.6
long

1840.64 --> 1845.44
ago but also it was like a dark

1843.6 --> 1849.0
bitterness to it

1845.44 --> 1851.0800000000002
all circumstantial and in this dream

1849.0 --> 1854.24
that dark bitterness wasn't there so it

1851.08 --> 1856.76
was almost like a a simu laam

1854.24 --> 1860.36
remnant of the deep love that I

1856.76 --> 1862.679
originally felt for her that was being

1860.36 --> 1866.4799999999998
personified in

1862.679 --> 1868.679
her but she wasn't in a relationship

1866.48 --> 1868.679
with

1869.44 --> 1873.519
me and like it didn't seem like that was

1872.399 --> 1876.799
going to happen

1873.519 --> 1881.48
either but just being like close to her

1876.799 --> 1884.279
in that state with her being the way

1881.48 --> 1886.159
that I really fell in love with her for

1884.279 --> 1889.159
and that's just

1886.159 --> 1889.159
like

1891.76 --> 1895.32
it just made me feel and especially when

1893.6 --> 1897.12
I woke up like I don't know if I'm ever

1895.32 --> 1899.12
going to experience anything like that

1897.12 --> 1902.0
again

1899.12 --> 1904.399
it's it defies description what that

1902.0 --> 1904.399
feels

1904.48 --> 1912.48
like and it made me think

1907.2 --> 1915.32
like how the hell did this even

1912.48 --> 1919.3990000000001
end it made me just

1915.32 --> 1922.76
rethink like that last year like I had

1919.399 --> 1925.559
ideas because I was like really I wanted

1922.76 --> 1928.639
to I wanted like I wanted

1925.559 --> 1931.72
kids time to move on yeah good luck with

1928.639 --> 1935.76
that artificial Angy time to move on

1931.72 --> 1939.159
yeah hey I am moving on I have moved on

1935.76 --> 1942.24
it's just that some things in life you

1939.159 --> 1944.72
can't really move on from really and

1942.24 --> 1944.72
besides

1945.88 --> 1953.1200000000001
it's it's it's all kind of mysterious it

1948.919 --> 1956.5590000000002
it wasn't even like really her as I said

1953.12 --> 1960.08
it's like a simulacrum of her of her how

1956.559 --> 1962.6789999999999
she was back then in ways and it missed

1960.08 --> 1966.8799999999999
certain traits of her so it wasn't

1962.679 --> 1969.519
actually her it wasn't like a a clean

1966.88 --> 1973.0800000000002
copy it was a

1969.519 --> 1974.799
personification of the dream of her that

1973.08 --> 1976.039
I fell in love with basically that's

1974.799 --> 1978.24
what it felt

1976.039 --> 1980.48
like

1978.24 --> 1980.48
the

1981.08 --> 1984.08
ideal

1988.2 --> 1992.76
right

1989.919 --> 1996.7990000000002
but I don't

1992.76 --> 2000.039
know I'm not it might even

1996.799 --> 2002.399
be somebody else that just has a lot of

2000.039 --> 2004.6
resemblance to her maybe it's it was

2002.399 --> 2007.2399999999998
actually because there were no like

2004.6 --> 2009.36
clear markers about her behavior here

2007.24 --> 2012.039
that are like oh yeah that's exactly

2009.36 --> 2014.1589999999999
what my ex did it just there was a lot

2012.039 --> 2017.8799999999999
of

2014.159 --> 2021.2
resemblance in like the general Spirit

2017.88 --> 2022.6390000000001
of it of her and even their looks were

2021.2 --> 2027.2
kind of

2022.639 --> 2029.1589999999999
similar it did to me it seemed like her

2027.2 --> 2031.799
but it could technically be somebody

2029.159 --> 2035.8400000000001
else and hey sometimes we meet people

2031.799 --> 2039.72
out there that are like uncannily remind

2035.84 --> 2043.12
us about people we knew it's like you

2039.72 --> 2045.1200000000001
look exactly like that person and you

2043.12 --> 2047.1589999999999
feel like that person and you talk like

2045.12 --> 2050.2
that person but you're not that person

2047.159 --> 2054.639
so this might be a woman that I actually

2050.2 --> 2058.2799999999997
might meet in the future and if so oh my

2054.639 --> 2058.28
God oh my

2065.879 --> 2068.879
God

2070.879 --> 2076.0789999999997
so you see the face yeah but the faces

2073.639 --> 2079.359
in those types of dreams are not super

2076.079 --> 2083.32
crystal clear though but it had just

2079.359 --> 2085.3199999999997
like her overall body shape was

2083.32 --> 2089.76
similar her

2085.32 --> 2092.32
interests were kind of similar but odd

2089.76 --> 2093.76
she had just the same kind of oddness

2092.32 --> 2096.639
like

2093.76 --> 2100.1600000000003
the like an oddness that's really hard

2096.639 --> 2102.76
like can't describe what that is I I

2100.16 --> 2103.7999999999997
don't know how I don't know how to

2102.76 --> 2108.5200000000004
describe

2103.8 --> 2111.1600000000003
that so it is kind of M mystical to me

2108.52 --> 2113.64
anyway hello Ben Johnston good to see

2111.16 --> 2114.96
you was she around for the early word

2113.64 --> 2119.72
shows

2114.96 --> 2123.76
no now that relationship was before Flat

2119.72 --> 2123.7599999999998
Earth I still remember

2125.04 --> 2132.64
that sharing like

2127.44 --> 2136.64
we I bumped into like a

2132.64 --> 2140.52
uh a flat earth related video back

2136.64 --> 2142.44
then told her about it it reminded me of

2140.52 --> 2144.96
Visions from

2142.44 --> 2147.96
before and I was saying like I really

2144.96 --> 2151.64
want to get into that she did

2147.96 --> 2152.839
not but I did like sort of try like had

2151.64 --> 2155.7999999999997
a friend

2152.839 --> 2158.2799999999997
Circle but some of these friends in this

2155.8 --> 2161.599
friend Circle were like like genuine

2158.28 --> 2164.76
Globe tards like really serious

2161.599 --> 2167.1600000000003
ballards and when I brought it up it

2164.76 --> 2169.92
created a

2167.16 --> 2172.359
friction it made me kind of unpopular

2169.92 --> 2176.96
with her friends yeah and this is before

2172.359 --> 2176.96
the Flat Earth Awakening even like

2178.119 --> 2181.119
2013

2182.839 --> 2188.72
2012 so but I mean this is like a long

2185.599 --> 2188.7200000000003
time ago

2190.079 --> 2196.8390000000004
and I don't know if it's been like a

2193.76 --> 2200.4
direct influence on Breaking the breakup

2196.839 --> 2202.52
or anything but it it wasn't helping it

2200.4 --> 2207.28
cuz back then I felt like I really want

2202.52 --> 2207.28
to get into this and she was like

2208.96 --> 2215.68
no she did not so I couldn't really

2212.52 --> 2218.72
share it with her my interest too much

2215.68 --> 2221.0789999999997
and that did create a bit of a rift on a

2218.72 --> 2224.04
spiritual level on a spiritual contact

2221.079 --> 2226.8
level which before that we were like

2224.04 --> 2230.04
continually like a spiritual team we

2226.8 --> 2232.96
thought about the same things we had

2230.04 --> 2234.92
very similar opinions and we were like

2232.96 --> 2237.76
like two best friends that were in a

2234.92 --> 2237.76
relationship

2238.119 --> 2244.28
continually and Flat Earth kind of broke

2241.24 --> 2248.5989999999997
that apart a bit it it chipped chipped

2244.28 --> 2248.599
it apart a little and

2249.2 --> 2255.0789999999997
and also after that other

2252.8 --> 2259.079
realizations like that we

2255.079 --> 2261.52
weren't it it kind of chipped away at

2259.079 --> 2265.0
the in love's spille maybe it it's

2261.52 --> 2268.48
complicated it's long ago I don't know

2265.0 --> 2271.72
but yeah my dream made me really it

2268.48 --> 2274.92
brought it all back like it it happened

2271.72 --> 2277.2799999999997
yesterday all of it which is weird

2274.92 --> 2279.76
because it's like 10 years ago more than

2277.28 --> 2279.76
10 years

2280.56 --> 2283.56
ago

2283.8 --> 2289.04
hello and John Bernards good to see

2293.44 --> 2300.2000000000003
you and thank you for pushing the like

2298.48 --> 2302.0
button

2300.2 --> 2307.359
okay

2302.0 --> 2309.52
sure I'm not ignoring you Buon Bernards

2307.359 --> 2312.68
I have no beef with you I know you've

2309.52 --> 2314.88
been like around for very long time on

2312.68 --> 2314.8799999999997
my

2322.64 --> 2327.24
channel right yeah an artificial Ang no

2325.4 --> 2329.52
she didn't dump me for a flat Earth

2327.24 --> 2329.52
that's

2330.28 --> 2335.52
right

2332.359 --> 2337.2799999999997
but the Flat Earth back

2335.52 --> 2341.119
then

2337.28 --> 2343.3590000000004
wasn't helping but you see when that

2341.119 --> 2346.44
happened I was already like kind of

2343.359 --> 2349.64
drifting off like realizing I have to

2346.44 --> 2352.319
like do something other than

2349.64 --> 2354.68
just be the man at home that does the

2352.319 --> 2357.8
cooking and the cleaning

2354.68 --> 2360.04
Etc and I was kind of like searching

2357.8 --> 2363.3590000000004
around searching around like what do I

2360.04 --> 2365.88
tackle what do I do and then Flat Earth

2363.359 --> 2369.04
did like a video kind of popped by and

2365.88 --> 2369.04
it was like well what is

2371.28 --> 2376.4
this or it wasn't even Flat Earth

2374.119 --> 2379.319
actually it was it started with

2376.4 --> 2382.52
expanding Earth it it started with

2379.319 --> 2386.319
this the nature of the earth and Hollow

2382.52 --> 2389.599
Earth that's where that started and then

2386.319 --> 2392.079
through that I kind of got

2389.599 --> 2393.92
remembering Vision related stuff that

2392.079 --> 2397.28
was related to Flat Earth and then I

2393.92 --> 2399.6800000000003
talked about it and that

2397.28 --> 2401.96
that wasn't

2399.68 --> 2404.64
helping oh yeah and of course I almost

2401.96 --> 2405.52
forgot during that time I had also that

2404.64 --> 2408.44
other

2405.52 --> 2411.16
friend that I was talking with about

2408.44 --> 2413.64
Flat Earth who later basically said we

2411.16 --> 2418.48
can't talk about that anymore because he

2413.64 --> 2423.5989999999997
had a little kid and I was there when he

2418.48 --> 2423.599
got threatened by this old Freemason

2423.92 --> 2429.96
guy he had that book of Eric B which is

2427.44 --> 2431.88
super surreal still I still don't I

2429.96 --> 2435.52
still can't explain

2431.88 --> 2438.1600000000003
that I had that book in my hands even

2435.52 --> 2440.96
though I don't think Eric dub had even

2438.16 --> 2442.839
published it yet it's so surreal like a

2440.96 --> 2447.8
lot of things back then were quite

2442.839 --> 2447.7999999999997
surreal but it was actually physically

2449.2 --> 2454.96
happening

2451.72 --> 2456.839
right I sometimes forget that there's

2454.96 --> 2459.64
like things that has happen

2456.839 --> 2463.52
happened before like

2459.64 --> 2467.319
2013 before I got here in

2463.52 --> 2470.079
2014 that were just really really

2467.319 --> 2474.2799999999997
bizarre that seemed to not make any

2470.079 --> 2476.88
logical sense in the timeline and even

2474.28 --> 2480.3590000000004
having discussions about that with the

2476.88 --> 2482.599
guy he said yeah there's this Publishing

2480.359 --> 2485.24
Company who can literally publish

2482.599 --> 2486.55
something before it's

2485.24 --> 2487.839
written

2486.55 --> 2489.3590000000004
[Music]

2487.839 --> 2493.319
what

2489.359 --> 2494.48
what and he was using that he found out

2493.319 --> 2498.16
about

2494.48 --> 2501.04
it through some weird Shady connection

2498.16 --> 2507.359
and he was using that so he had a

2501.04 --> 2507.359
book published and printed before it was

2511.2 --> 2517.9199999999996
written get a job in the trades works

2514.8 --> 2520.6400000000003
every okay that's interesting would work

2517.92 --> 2520.64
in gny Bear

2521.839 --> 2526.4
maybe yes Li part I'm I've hav't been

2524.72 --> 2528.7999999999997
informed about

2526.4 --> 2531.56
it it's

2528.8 --> 2535.119
ridiculous I mean according to that

2531.56 --> 2540.359
video and I did watch it and to be

2535.119 --> 2544.319
fair it was kind of funny it was kind of

2540.359 --> 2545.7599999999998
witty but I highly dis thought it was

2544.319 --> 2549.24
highly distasteful because it was

2545.76 --> 2551.92
basically that Hitler meme

2549.24 --> 2555.7599999999998
video and I don't like to be compared to

2551.92 --> 2559.7200000000003
Hitler that's that's just way too far

2555.76 --> 2559.7200000000003
and like completely out of

2560.88 --> 2569.88
place but uh apparently that's going on

2563.92 --> 2572.6800000000003
now so I am Hitler now why why

2569.88 --> 2574.88
because I don't want [Â __Â ] trolls in

2572.68 --> 2577.359
my chat and that makes me Hitler because

2574.88 --> 2579.599
apparently Banning trolls from your chat

2577.359 --> 2582.7599999999998
is a crime against

2579.599 --> 2586.96
humanity according to

2582.76 --> 2586.96
them it's it's

2594.0 --> 2600.0
insane trades are where is

2597.0 --> 2600.0
at

2603.119 --> 2609.079
what cruelty to trolls yeah

2610.76 --> 2617.7200000000003
well I'm

2613.96 --> 2620.359
sorry do they deserve anything else

2617.72 --> 2620.359
other than

2622.48 --> 2630.359
cruelty they're nagging time wasting

2626.44 --> 2632.119
bastards who only like parasites try to

2630.359 --> 2635.0789999999997
get in the way and don't give anything

2632.119 --> 2638.079
in return I'm sorry they deserve nothing

2635.079 --> 2638.079
but cruelty

2639.04 --> 2642.52
yeah nothing

2644.55 --> 2650.28
[Music]

2646.8 --> 2653.48
but Hitler had dreams too I'm sure he

2650.28 --> 2653.48
did would work in gy

2654.0 --> 2657.2
Bear all

2658.599 --> 2663.119
right oh let me Clutch thanks for the

2661.4 --> 2665.0
input I'm I'm going to ra your comment

2663.119 --> 2668.0
right

2665.0 --> 2668.0
now

2675.079 --> 2682.319
have some connections to a

2679.16 --> 2684.1189999999997
different realm

2682.319 --> 2687.48
yes

2684.119 --> 2690.2400000000002
and it's interesting too because now

2687.48 --> 2693.119
that I completely quit the Cannabis I'm

2690.24 --> 2695.0
getting these really really vivid dreams

2693.119 --> 2697.04
and like those dreams like have an

2695.0 --> 2700.24
emotional impact on

2697.04 --> 2701.7599999999998
me it's not like the and I described my

2700.24 --> 2703.359
dreams before because even when I was

2701.76 --> 2706.0400000000004
smoking cannabis I would still have

2703.359 --> 2708.7599999999998
dreams but they were like half dreams so

2706.04 --> 2712.079
it's like it's kind of vague I'm doing

2708.76 --> 2715.6800000000003
things I'm like the what I described I'm

2712.079 --> 2717.88
like in this giant Warehouse full of

2715.68 --> 2720.839
virtual things and I'm like flicking

2717.88 --> 2722.7200000000003
through it all remember that that's

2720.839 --> 2724.599
still a dream but it's a very different

2722.72 --> 2726.9199999999996
type of dream dreams that I had

2724.599 --> 2729.599
yesterday were like full suspension

2726.92 --> 2731.2400000000002
dreams where it's also like I'm more

2729.599 --> 2734.2000000000003
emotionally connected and everything

2731.24 --> 2734.2
it's deeper

2739.64 --> 2748.64
meaning babyon BR great parody Neals

2744.839 --> 2751.87
newr okay like part I'm sure they

2748.64 --> 2751.87
[Music]

2753.96 --> 2760.079
are right

2757.76 --> 2762.8390000000004
but I mean look the video from yesterday

2760.079 --> 2767.6400000000003
that thing they played I'd say haaha

2762.839 --> 2769.92
that's really funny if it isn't just

2767.64 --> 2773.24
like like what the [Â __Â ] are you

2769.92 --> 2776.119
comparing me to Hitler for that's that

2773.24 --> 2777.4399999999996
like that really is too far like I've

2776.119 --> 2781.1600000000003
never done

2777.44 --> 2782.92
anything other than get really rage wiy

2781.16 --> 2785.2799999999997
and yeah I did tell people to kill

2782.92 --> 2787.64
themselves well oh my God what a [Â __Â ]

2785.28 --> 2792.3190000000004
crime against

2787.64 --> 2796.68
Humanity I told really annoying troll

2792.319 --> 2798.2
people something that is like a bad

2796.68 --> 2800.96
thing to

2798.2 --> 2803.64
say oh my God now I'm

2800.96 --> 2805.96
Hitler sorry but that just that makes no

2803.64 --> 2805.96
damn

2806.76 --> 2810.28
sense it's too

2810.52 --> 2816.24
far

2812.8 --> 2819.28
like that basically ruins it it ruins

2816.24 --> 2821.52
the funny of it I don't deserve to be

2819.28 --> 2824.2400000000002
compared to that at

2821.52 --> 2826.319
all like at

2824.24 --> 2829.3999999999996
all but whatever they're going to do

2826.319 --> 2829.4
what they're going to do anyway

2832.44 --> 2838.88
and to be fair I think it's way more

2836.28 --> 2841.44
disturbing that flatso just does that on

2838.88 --> 2843.839
his live streams I

2841.44 --> 2844.7200000000003
mean I thought his channel was about

2843.839 --> 2847.72
Flat

2844.72 --> 2847.72
Earth

2848.16 --> 2854.0789999999997
it seems more to be about trolls and

2851.359 --> 2857.0789999999997
just people on the

2854.079 --> 2860.0
internet and ridiculing people on the

2857.079 --> 2860.0
internet I

2860.119 --> 2864.44
mean there's not going to be a lot of

2862.559 --> 2865.96
actual people that are interested or

2864.44 --> 2869.16
curious about Flat Earth that are going

2865.96 --> 2872.52
to like watch flat SIDS and be like wow

2869.16 --> 2875.7599999999998
I really learned something here today at

2872.52 --> 2877.839
all so he's just Gathering trolls I mean

2875.76 --> 2881.3590000000004
is a troll herder I've said it before

2877.839 --> 2883.599
and he's just doing it he is being a

2881.359 --> 2885.96
troll herder and it's not my problem

2883.599 --> 2885.96
really

2886.44 --> 2892.64
and like I don't know why why he would

2889.319 --> 2892.64
do that to

2893.79 --> 2899.52
[Music]

2896.48 --> 2903.359
himself people called you ad when you

2899.52 --> 2903.359
had a little must oh you had that that's

2904.64 --> 2908.7999999999997
hilarious

2906.68 --> 2911.5589999999997
I mean if you have that type of mustache

2908.8 --> 2914.48
then yeah I mean they're going to call

2911.559 --> 2917.0
you that that's not

2914.48 --> 2920.04
weird I never had that kind of mustache

2917.0 --> 2922.88
my mustache has always been this this

2920.04 --> 2925.96
like this so and it's not like Hitler's

2922.88 --> 2928.4500000000003
mustache at all so it's kind of

2925.96 --> 2931.489
ridiculous to compare that

2928.45 --> 2931.489
[Music]

2934.599 --> 2937.599
anyway

2944.079 --> 2949.44
dreams happening for real same people

2946.52 --> 2951.92
same s yes would work well those are

2949.44 --> 2954.799
like premonition dreams premonition

2951.92 --> 2958.7200000000003
dreams are usually kind of short they

2954.799 --> 2962.319
last like 30 seconds to a

2958.72 --> 2964.9599999999996
minute and they're very like uncanny

2962.319 --> 2966.599
specific like you're trying to figure

2964.96 --> 2969.96
out like what is this where is this but

2966.599 --> 2973.599
you don't really have the time even

2969.96 --> 2975.64
to you don't often you get very real

2973.599 --> 2978.3590000000004
roaded in what happens and you don't get

2975.64 --> 2978.359
to like look

2978.68 --> 2983.5989999999997
around and that's how I recognize hey

2981.4 --> 2985.0
this is actually a potential for look

2983.599 --> 2990.0
into the

2985.0 --> 2990.0
future instead of a dream

2992.2 --> 2997.52
simulation

2994.52 --> 2997.52
anyway

3001.119 --> 3004.44
oh that's interesting something bad

3003.0 --> 3007.16
happens in the dream

3004.44 --> 3009.7200000000003
and you try to change it that's that's

3007.16 --> 3012.92
fascinating when work go

3009.72 --> 3015.0789999999997
anywhere anyway I'm hungry I'm going to

3012.92 --> 3019.319
take a bite out of my Illuminati Kasam

3015.079 --> 3019.319
before it gets cold so

3024.44 --> 3027.44
cheers

3029.64 --> 3032.71
[Music]

3040.38 --> 3043.4390000000003
[Music]

3063.84 --> 3067.05
[Music]

3069.63 --> 3072.789
[Music]

3074.81 --> 3078.0499999999997
[Music]

3084.359 --> 3087.359
for

3091.72 --> 3100.839
yeah today is going to be probably

3095.079 --> 3105.44
very dream themed I mean I'm still

3100.839 --> 3105.44
processing what happened last like this

3106.839 --> 3111.52
night it because this is not the first

3110.079 --> 3114.3590000000004
time it's

3111.52 --> 3117.359
like I fell in

3114.359 --> 3117.359
love

3120.28 --> 3123.0400000000004
fell in love

3123.799 --> 3129.839
again falling in love for me is an

3127.64 --> 3132.04
extremely

3129.839 --> 3136.0
extraordinarily rare

3132.04 --> 3137.88
event it really is and from everything

3136.0 --> 3141.4
that I've seen all the people that I've

3137.88 --> 3145.0
run into it seems like it is becoming

3141.4 --> 3145.88
more and more rare it was even rare 10

3145.0 --> 3148.96
years

3145.88 --> 3150.7200000000003
ago and that's why I've kind of like

3148.96 --> 3153.04
thought like yeah this is not going to

3150.72 --> 3153.04
happen

3154.0 --> 3162.079
anymore like that window of opportunity

3157.64 --> 3164.52
felt logically like it was

3162.079 --> 3166.8390000000004
closing and I've kind of regarded like

3164.52 --> 3171.0
my ex as being like the last person I

3166.839 --> 3174.96
really fell in love with in a big

3171.0 --> 3175.92
way I can still love people and I can

3174.96 --> 3178.559
like

3175.92 --> 3181.88
trust them and like I could technically

3178.559 --> 3184.1600000000003
like marry a woman even have kids but

3181.88 --> 3188.1600000000003
it's not going to be like that

3184.16 --> 3188.16
anymore like with the in love

3188.599 --> 3194.96
Factor the window is closing or it felt

3192.28 --> 3197.2400000000002
like it was closing and hey God can like

3194.96 --> 3199.92
really surprise you and you're like it's

3197.24 --> 3203.7599999999998
closing it's closing wait what it's

3199.92 --> 3205.76
opening it's who knows maybe I am

3203.76 --> 3209.3590000000004
transforming in ways

3205.76 --> 3209.3590000000004
and it will

3210.24 --> 3215.5589999999997
return but it's felt like it had been

3212.72 --> 3219.4399999999996
closing for a

3215.559 --> 3223.2400000000002
while and in a way it's kind of better

3219.44 --> 3225.88
because being in love has caused me the

3223.24 --> 3228.7599999999998
most excruciating

3225.88 --> 3231.1600000000003
heartaches imaginable in my life it hurt

3228.76 --> 3233.7200000000003
worse than anything else including like

3231.16 --> 3233.72
fear of

3234.16 --> 3237.16
death

3237.799 --> 3245.68
like the pain that came out of it has

3240.799 --> 3245.68
like palpably created hallucinations for

3248.799 --> 3252.04
me and

3252.079 --> 3257.4
depression and I was a little worried

3254.079 --> 3259.4
this morning that oh [Â __Â ] I hope I'm not

3257.4 --> 3264.079
going to go depressed over this because

3259.4 --> 3266.2400000000002
it it was like this strong sense of

3264.079 --> 3268.319
nostalgia

3266.24 --> 3271.0
but I'm talking about it and I do feel

3268.319 --> 3276.04
better I do already kind of feel

3271.0 --> 3278.28
better and guys I feel so

3276.04 --> 3280.88
healthy I don't know what the hell is

3278.28 --> 3283.599
going on with me I don't know if it's

3280.88 --> 3287.52
just quitting cannabis or something but

3283.599 --> 3287.52
I feel so

3291.48 --> 3297.76
healthy I read a couple of pages of

3294.64 --> 3301.68
Rudolph Steiner and I had like no

3297.76 --> 3304.28
problem focusing and like even

3301.68 --> 3307.5989999999997
remembering half a page before what I

3304.28 --> 3311.48
read I've never been this concentrated

3307.599 --> 3313.799
reading ever ever in my entire life have

3311.48 --> 3317.319
I been able to read something this

3313.799 --> 3320.2
complicated and completely

3317.319 --> 3322.319
Focus so there's something going on

3320.2 --> 3327.0
there's some kind of transformation and

3322.319 --> 3327.0
is really really working out

3329.24 --> 3332.839
it's almost like I'm leveling

3354.0 --> 3357.0
up

3380.4 --> 3385.52
that's very interesting Woodwork and gy

3382.28 --> 3389.2000000000003
bear what you say there

3385.52 --> 3391.68
you play a huge part in whether or not

3389.2 --> 3395.7599999999998
you are able to love someone as much or

3391.68 --> 3397.44
more than you previously have it's a

3395.76 --> 3400.44
very

3397.44 --> 3400.44
interesting

3400.68 --> 3406.48
statement that Rings true in an esoteric

3404.92 --> 3409.44
way

3406.48 --> 3412.68
and in a way with the previous

3409.44 --> 3412.68
relationship how that

3412.799 --> 3418.28
went I personally kind of closed it

3421.4 --> 3426.839
off because with her I was like in a

3424.319 --> 3428.68
sort of Pinnacle I was in a pinnacle it

3426.839 --> 3433.5589999999997
was

3428.68 --> 3433.5589999999997
like in ways the best I had ever

3433.68 --> 3439.96
imagined but then when I wanted to

3438.0 --> 3443.4
continue it

3439.96 --> 3446.0
crumbled it it went to a dead end and

3443.4 --> 3449.48
that was so monumental disappointing to

3446.0 --> 3452.799
me in a very deep way that I was

3449.48 --> 3452.799
like it's

3454.119 --> 3460.119
over like not the relationship like it's

3457.559 --> 3463.599
over for

3460.119 --> 3467.48
me like I can't do something like this

3463.599 --> 3470.2000000000003
anymore but I mean 10 years have

3467.48 --> 3472.64
passed I've really not aged all that

3470.2 --> 3473.799
much in these 10 years I mean seriously

3472.64 --> 3476.4
I have

3473.799 --> 3479.28
not

3476.4 --> 3481.2400000000002
and I feel

3479.28 --> 3484.559
stronger

3481.24 --> 3484.5589999999997
wiser more

3484.76 --> 3489.559
Resolute it's not just knowing to do the

3488.0 --> 3491.48
right thing and sticking to it and not

3489.559 --> 3494.079
be seduced anymore but it's actually

3491.48 --> 3496.359
getting better at doing the right thing

3494.079 --> 3499.44
I'm I've gotten a lot

3496.359 --> 3501.88
better at actually were walking that

3499.44 --> 3501.88
narrow

3502.319 --> 3508.0
path it's not just symbolic any or not

3505.24 --> 3512.4799999999996
just like oh I should do that no I have

3508.0 --> 3515.839
I am doing it I am becoming

3512.48 --> 3518.799
better despite all the trolls and all

3515.839 --> 3518.799
that [Â __Â ] and

3522.96 --> 3526.64
everything so again

3527.359 --> 3533.72
maybe maybe it is opening again I do

3530.76 --> 3536.7200000000003
kind of feel like

3533.72 --> 3536.72
wow

3541.52 --> 3544.599
maybe I can do it

3550.359 --> 3555.0389999999998
again that's interesting if you're not

3553.319 --> 3556.7599999999998
ready you're going to ensure that it

3555.039 --> 3560.079
won't happen

3556.76 --> 3560.079
yeah but

3561.559 --> 3566.3190000000004
really and there's been women out there

3563.96 --> 3569.4
and girls that that seemed to find me

3566.319 --> 3572.16
attractive at a distance and I would be

3569.4 --> 3574.599
like it's not working it's not working

3572.16 --> 3574.5989999999997
on my

3575.52 --> 3580.119
side I don't

3577.92 --> 3583.2000000000003
have the

3580.119 --> 3584.96
ground to plant that seed in it's frozen

3583.2 --> 3587.839
the ground is frozen you can't put a

3584.96 --> 3587.839
seed in frozen

3588.21 --> 3591.36
[Music]

3593.64 --> 3596.64
ground

3606.69 --> 3616.429
[Music]

3623.559 --> 3626.559

3645.24 --> 3651.52
all right hope everybody's enjoying

3647.4 --> 3651.52
Today's Show it's all about

3653.359 --> 3657.72
dreams it's it feels like it's good to

3655.599 --> 3660.6800000000003
talk about especially with this kind of

3657.72 --> 3662.8799999999997
dreary weather not just be a downer

3660.68 --> 3662.8799999999997
about

3663.72 --> 3669.1189999999997
it to warm up the ground first that's

3675.72 --> 3682.9599999999996
right I could still I mean I haven't

3679.92 --> 3686.319
really harped on about it I can still

3682.96 --> 3687.16
use some support

3686.319 --> 3691.96
have

3687.16 --> 3693.96
roughly two weeks to go through and even

3691.96 --> 3695.599
though I'm not smoking cannabis anymore

3693.96 --> 3698.599
I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be able

3695.599 --> 3703.319
to make the entire two weeks with what I

3698.599 --> 3703.319
got so any support would be very

3713.44 --> 3716.44
welcome

3743.359 --> 3747.8199999999997
okay

3744.67 --> 3747.82
[Music]

3773.319 --> 3776.359

3844.799 --> 3848.64

ends

3893.16 --> 3896.16

3928.66 --> 3931.87
[Music]

3938.16 --> 3941.35
[Music]

3943.54 --> 3946.75
[Music]

3953.079 --> 3956.079
yeah

3967.4 --> 3974.0
right so yeah that's first hour to show

3971.76 --> 3976.76
mostly about

3974.0 --> 3978.279
dreams I kind of like laid it all down

3976.76 --> 3981.96
as much as

3978.279 --> 3981.96
I I could I

3983.0 --> 3986.0
think

4001.63 --> 4004.7090000000003
[Music]

4012.4 --> 4019.64
could also attempted to talk about rut

4014.92 --> 4019.64
Steiner but I mean it's very tough

4025.96 --> 4030.079
material hello Godzilla yeah it's

4028.64 --> 4034.92
already already I'm not going to make

4030.079 --> 4034.92
the show about that I already addressed

4041.75 --> 4045.92
[Music]

4042.92 --> 4045.92
it

4050.64 --> 4056.0389999999998
I'm part of a Hitler meme now that's

4053.079 --> 4059.119
cool it was kind of funny it's better

4056.039 --> 4061.039
than some other Hitler meme videos that

4059.119 --> 4063.7200000000003
I've seen out

4061.039 --> 4065.2000000000003
there but I mean I don't like still

4063.72 --> 4067.5989999999997
think

4065.2 --> 4070.5589999999997
it's very

4067.599 --> 4072.92
rude that they'd compare me to that it's

4070.559 --> 4075.92
very

4072.92 --> 4075.92
inappropriate

4102.839 --> 4105.839
for

4125.84 --> 4128.9890000000005
[Music]

4131.56 --> 4135.799
like laughing Spanish guy

4137.48 --> 4142.2789999999995
well that would be kind of

4139.239 --> 4144.5599999999995
lame like keep

4142.279 --> 4148.759
uh I mean they could go ahead all they

4144.56 --> 4148.759
like it's just whatever

4149.839 --> 4156.239
man I got several channels now dedicated

4153.319 --> 4159.279
to trolling making Troll videos about me

4156.239 --> 4161.959999999999
I mean I don't even understand why at

4159.279 --> 4165.120000000001
this point I have my suspicions but it's

4161.96 --> 4167.279
just kind of surreal

4165.12 --> 4171.48
I mean just I'm a

4167.279 --> 4174.4800000000005
guy with a like a very small channel

4171.48 --> 4174.48
here

4176.4 --> 4180.4
okay it makes no damn

4180.56 --> 4189.120000000001
sense unless I'm

4183.56 --> 4189.120000000001
this Savage spiritual threat to these

4189.52 --> 4195.719
people but I mean that's

4192.719 --> 4195.719
crazy

4201.159 --> 4206.4
a tiny little Channel on

4203.92 --> 4208.4800000000005
YouTube most people don't even know

4206.4 --> 4213.5199999999995
about

4208.48 --> 4216.199
me but with all these guys going after

4213.52 --> 4218.6
me like don't they realize they're

4216.199 --> 4222.599999999999
actually basically sending

4218.6 --> 4225.320000000001
some pretty cool guys my way because of

4222.6 --> 4227.88
that it's it's already been

4225.32 --> 4229.48
happening there have been people new

4227.88 --> 4232.679
people that I never heard of that have

4229.48 --> 4236.12
been contacting me like hey there's this

4232.679 --> 4236.12
crazy [Â __Â ] going on out

4239.32 --> 4246.96
there so I mean in that sense I'm almost

4244.76 --> 4250.52
kind of happy because there's just some

4246.96 --> 4252.64
really cool guys that are gathering and

4250.52 --> 4255.64
I'm becoming friends with

4252.64 --> 4255.64
them

4258.0 --> 4262.96
I see me as a l cow well whatever

4275.44 --> 4280.159
man wonder you claimed unicorns were

4280.56 --> 4285.56
real right well whatever

4291.92 --> 4296.679
hey sometimes I get a little goofy about

4294.199 --> 4299.32
things and like very open-minded how

4296.679 --> 4301.8
dare I I mean am I the only one that's

4299.32 --> 4301.799999999999
doing

4303.199 --> 4310.759999999999
that there's way larger channels that

4306.08 --> 4313.0
talk a lot more nonsensically than I

4310.76 --> 4316.159000000001
do sometimes I like to get very

4313.0 --> 4316.159
open-minded about

4319.52 --> 4326.4800000000005
things yeah those other channels that do

4322.84 --> 4328.56
that and do a lot do it a lot goofier

4326.48 --> 4331.0
even like they don't receive giant

4328.56 --> 4331.0
amounts of

4331.92 --> 4339.56
trolling so it's

4334.92 --> 4339.56
just it still doesn't make any sense

4341.96 --> 4346.719
Gilla yeah and hey I don't have to be

4345.199 --> 4349.0

4346.719 --> 4352.08
consistent you're just dropping hints

4409.94 --> 4413.219999999999
[Music]

4426.08 --> 4433.92

4428.679 --> 4436.679
oracle this is one's easy yeah well

4437.96 --> 4442.56
not why don't you call me out on my

4440.28 --> 4445.08
predictions that I had wrong gzilla

4442.56 --> 4447.1990000000005
tell me about the predictions that I

4445.08 --> 4449.6
roll out as our winning predictions that

4447.199 --> 4452.599999999999
I got

4449.6 --> 4452.6
wrong

4462.28 --> 4465.28
well

4475.36 --> 4478.159
I'm sure you'll be able to mention one

4477.08 --> 4480.84
or

4478.159 --> 4482.679
two but I mean those are relatively

4480.84 --> 4484.639
minor things and I corrected them as

4482.679 --> 4488.12
soon as I figured it

4484.639 --> 4488.12
out I'm not

4488.36 --> 4493.5199999999995
perfect but I mean there's a whole bunch

4490.92 --> 4495.679
of things that I predicted that I got

4493.52 --> 4499.52
right that I definitely got right

4495.679 --> 4502.0
technological Wise geopolitical Wise I

4499.52 --> 4502.0

how [Â __Â ] dare you talk to me like

5200.719 --> 5207.639
man like

5203.719 --> 5210.2390000000005
really I called myself an oracle which

5207.639 --> 5213.96
is like a function that you could do and

5210.239 --> 5217.28
that and that basically means that oh my

5213.96 --> 5220.719
God that deserves like several dedicated

5217.28 --> 5220.719
trolling channels

5228.199 --> 5231.199
really

5241.119 --> 5244.119
yeah

5261.58 --> 5264.7699999999995

5271.119 --> 5274.119

LSG good to see you

5301.04 --> 5304.04
man

5329.159 --> 5335.4
oh what a scam I'm such a scammer

5332.679 --> 5337.96
I'm healing people at a distance I'm

5335.4 --> 5339.96
such a [Â __Â ] scammer I don't even ask

5337.96 --> 5343.88
money for it I just do it I mean that's

5339.96 --> 5347.719
a scam right that's what per definition

5343.88 --> 5350.36
is a scam you just do something for free

5347.719 --> 5350.36
now I'm a

5354.639 --> 5359.679
scammer you people are [Â __Â ] out of

5357.4 --> 5359.679
your

5360.92 --> 5363.92
minds

5368.719 --> 5373.2390000000005
you think people should be verified on

5370.48 --> 5377.08
the internet to stop trolling I think

5373.239 --> 5380.32
that doing anything to achieve anything

5377.08 --> 5380.32
is only going to make things

5381.04 --> 5389.119
worse although an internet ID in ways

5385.679 --> 5391.04
you know in a world that was better

5389.119 --> 5393.5199999999995
seems reasonable the problem is the

5391.04 --> 5396.159
world isn't better

5393.52 --> 5398.76
and anything we give them any kind of

5396.159 --> 5399.839999999999
control they will only politically abuse

5398.76 --> 5402.92
and you know

5399.84 --> 5404.84
it so anything we give them will only be

5402.92 --> 5406.639
used to crack down on political

5404.84 --> 5410.0
opponents and that's all they'll do with

5406.639 --> 5411.679
it they want stop trolling they won't

5410.0 --> 5414.44
stop the trolling at

5411.679 --> 5418.96
all so anything we give him for any

5414.44 --> 5418.96
reason whatsoever can only lead to worse

5420.84 --> 5423.84
things

5426.33 --> 5432.22

5843.0 --> 5846.92
I mean if this kind of behavior wasn't

5845.08 --> 5850.88
so

5846.92 --> 5853.4800000000005
rampant over the ages then like why

5850.88 --> 5856.679
would any person come up with like oh we

5853.48 --> 5860.0
need to cut down the

5856.679 --> 5862.84
population cuz like technically they

5860.0 --> 5864.679
even know that there is potentially

5862.84 --> 5867.04
unlimited resource there's always more

5864.679 --> 5869.599
there's always more resources so it's

5867.04 --> 5872.4
not about that it's

5869.599 --> 5875.32
about the average content of the

5872.4 --> 5875.32
characters of the

5875.96 --> 5884.2390000000005
people and the loss of purpose because

5879.84 --> 5887.28
of luxury and Technology leads to more

5884.239 --> 5890.08
increasingly demonic behavior in people

5887.28 --> 5892.36
that just have nothing useful to do with

5890.08 --> 5892.36
their

5896.76 --> 5901.84
lives nobody wants to cut population

5899.92 --> 5905.4
yeah they do

5901.84 --> 5910.400000000001
oh yeah yeah and besides those taxes

5905.4 --> 5910.4
you're talking about they don't need

5910.639 --> 5913.84
taxes at

5914.639 --> 5920.96
all

5916.36 --> 5923.799999999999
yeah taxes are merely a system just to

5920.96 --> 5927.76
suppress the

5923.8 --> 5929.4400000000005
people they don't need the taxes at all

5927.76 --> 5932.159000000001
whatever they need they just print out

5929.44 --> 5937.96
of thin air that's been going

5932.159 --> 5937.96
for a long time they don't need

5938.56 --> 5946.4800000000005
anything they just want you to pay taxes

5942.719 --> 5949.4
so because that makes you busy with that

5946.48 --> 5952.48
and it's suppresses people yeah you pay

5949.4 --> 5954.719
taxes to be suppressed not for

5952.48 --> 5957.0
maintenance on

5954.719 --> 5960.36
anything how would government pay for

5957.0 --> 5963.04
things they print it they just make it

5960.36 --> 5963.04
out of nothing

5963.48 --> 5969.4
they've been doing that for

5966.599 --> 5972.04
ages and they will keep doing it and yes

5969.4 --> 5974.08
it will make everything worse but the

5972.04 --> 5978.32
fact remains is that they just don't

5974.08 --> 5982.199
need any taxes really that's a

5978.32 --> 5982.199
ruse a cover

5983.88 --> 5989.96
story to still make people believe like

5987.159 --> 5992.199
it's a system of which they are a part

5989.96 --> 5994.639
of which they are a

5992.199 --> 5999.638999999999
necessity to to

5994.639 --> 6002.36
not to basically dim down the

5999.639 --> 6005.0
fear of the realization that they've

6002.36 --> 6008.759999999999
become completely

6005.0 --> 6011.199
Superfluous to the ruling class who

6008.76 --> 6013.4800000000005
technically doesn't need them anymore I

6011.199 --> 6016.719
mean on the longest of run if like the

6013.48 --> 6019.638999999999
entire ruling class if they just kill

6016.719 --> 6021.96
everybody else then eventually like yeah

6019.639 --> 6024.679
there wouldn't be any more services

6021.96 --> 6027.4800000000005
production would go down etc etc on the

6024.679 --> 6031.08
longest wrong run it

6027.48 --> 6035.199
would basically finish everything

6031.08 --> 6038.32
off but that's on the longest

6035.199 --> 6041.36
run and it doesn't seem truly attainable

6038.32 --> 6041.36
so they're just like

6041.76 --> 6048.4400000000005
no the only thing that they're just

6045.52 --> 6051.56
making you still believe like they're in

6048.44 --> 6054.799999999999
need of you to keep things up

6051.56 --> 6056.719
but they don't actually believe that and

6054.8 --> 6058.719
they're definitely not counting on it

6056.719 --> 6060.44
they're not like oh my God are they

6058.719 --> 6062.639
actually going to pay the taxes this

6060.44 --> 6065.799999999999
year or we really need that or this

6062.639 --> 6069.1990000000005
thing we can't do it

6065.8 --> 6069.1990000000005
no no they

6079.84 --> 6082.84
don't

6108.96 --> 6114.56
yeah I mean once a upon a

6112.04 --> 6117.32
time when there was like still a gold

6114.56 --> 6119.2390000000005
standard and all that yeah then taxes

6117.32 --> 6121.759999999999
were actually

6119.239 --> 6125.48
necessary but since

6121.76 --> 6131.320000000001
the uh the Fiat

6125.48 --> 6131.32
system that's no longer the case it just

6133.199 --> 6139.5599999999995
isn't they can basically just Rob the

6137.199 --> 6141.44
value of everything that's out there by

6139.56 --> 6142.8
just printing it and like nobody can

6141.44 --> 6145.598999999999
stop

6142.8 --> 6148.679
them yeah so they can just create out of

6145.599 --> 6151.96
nothing whatever they need and by doing

6148.679 --> 6154.1990000000005
that in the direct sense Rob the value

6151.96 --> 6156.88
of everything else that's out there so

6154.199 --> 6160.919999999999
they don't need you to pay

6156.88 --> 6160.92
taxes to do anything they

6169.76 --> 6172.76
don't

6199.679 --> 6202.679
for

6229.679 --> 6232.679
Co

6239.36 --> 6243.92
let's put that in there title it's a

6241.719 --> 6243.92
good

6244.32 --> 6247.88
title all right

6254.96 --> 6259.0
anyway I mean it's a good it's an

6257.239 --> 6261.5599999999995
important realization it's been like

6259.0 --> 6263.88
that for a while like I believe like

6261.56 --> 6267.0
yeah but they need the taxes

6263.88 --> 6270.1990000000005
right and like yeah in a in a normal

6267.0 --> 6274.4
balanced system where government is in

6270.199 --> 6274.4
ways accountable and not completely

6274.48 --> 6279.119
Rogue and has their own money sour as

6277.08 --> 6281.159
their own direct connections to banks

6279.119 --> 6285.4
that are unaccountable to the

6281.159 --> 6288.5599999999995
people then yes there would be this

6285.4 --> 6290.04
cycle of taxes and if people refuse to

6288.56 --> 6291.84
pay it then the government would

6290.04 --> 6294.84
basically

6291.84 --> 6298.8
collapse but it it it's not working like

6294.84 --> 6298.8
that now it's not like that

6300.56 --> 6307.88
anymore like technically government has

6304.44 --> 6311.119
become completely

6307.88 --> 6315.4800000000005
independent they have their own money

6311.119 --> 6318.239
sources they have their people in all

6315.48 --> 6320.5599999999995
the places they need including judges

6318.239 --> 6323.28
and everything and so they are

6320.56 --> 6327.4400000000005
effectively independent from the

6323.28 --> 6333.159
people which is the worst position ever

6327.44 --> 6333.159
it is total dictatorship position covert

6335.55 --> 6338.649
[Music]

6349.48 --> 6352.48
dictatorship

6366.8 --> 6374.400000000001
I know fire want right woodwor gy

6371.08 --> 6378.5599999999995
bear well that well in that

6374.4 --> 6380.48
sense you're just like that's now you

6378.56 --> 6381.4400000000005
know exactly where it's going and it's

6380.48 --> 6386.239
it's

6381.44 --> 6389.239
like it's a a jar of money that's like

6386.239 --> 6392.839999999999
their direct budget so that that is like

6389.239 --> 6394.799999999999
the original way taxes work you actually

6392.84 --> 6396.76
know where it's

6394.8 --> 6399.28
going in my

6396.76 --> 6402.2390000000005
country that's it doesn't even work like

6399.28 --> 6406.119
that anymore it it seems to sort of

6402.239 --> 6408.799999999999
be working like that but then a lot of

6406.119 --> 6411.36
the times like the money is just taken

6408.8 --> 6416.320000000001
out used for some something

6411.36 --> 6419.44
else and outside money is inserted in

6416.32 --> 6419.44
and it's like it's a

6433.36 --> 6439.32
mess you basically get a scenario where

6437.4 --> 6442.638999999999
outside

6439.32 --> 6446.96
unaccountable Banks

6442.639 --> 6451.08
hijack the funding of a country and its

6446.96 --> 6451.08
services like they they hijack

6451.159 --> 6458.199
it they they buy it up in a way and then

6456.04 --> 6462.44
the people don't have control

6458.199 --> 6466.678999999999
anymore over what they actually want to

6462.44 --> 6472.32
have but what is supposed to be

6466.679 --> 6472.32
there that's happening across the entire

6499.239 --> 6509.218999999999
West

6500.91 --> 6509.219
[Music]

6511.48 --> 6514.0
right

6522.48 --> 6527.08
anyway how can the government pay for

6524.84 --> 6527.08
these

6529.199 --> 6532.199
things

6532.84 --> 6539.360000000001
they just do it they

6535.48 --> 6542.119
just get the money they print it they

6539.36 --> 6546.759999999999
get outside investors

6542.119 --> 6548.679
they allow Banks or Mega corporations to

6546.76 --> 6551.599
just

6548.679 --> 6556.0
get preferential treatment and they pay

6551.599 --> 6556.0
for that it's it's all just gets really

6559.119 --> 6562.119
convoluted

6563.159 --> 6566.638999999999
would we get that money

6589.119 --> 6592.119
no

6633.239 --> 6636.4
well at least the rating has

6649.04 --> 6652.04
stopped

6655.92 --> 6663.8
print W value go

6657.719 --> 6663.8
down P yes Thea D but

6664.4 --> 6671.0
also they can basically hold back the

6667.56 --> 6673.2390000000005
inflation and stuff by just putting

6671.0 --> 6675.88
giant barriers in between financially

6673.239 --> 6678.799999999999
it's like similar to

6675.88 --> 6682.88
how silver especially silver price but

6678.8 --> 6686.4400000000005
gold also little has been like kept down

6682.88 --> 6690.28
artificially that's

6686.44 --> 6690.28
even 15 years

6690.44 --> 6695.799999999999
ago by creating like an artificial

6696.36 --> 6703.5599999999995
market

6698.88 --> 6707.92
and effectively trading more coupons for

6703.56 --> 6708.96
supposed silver than even existed and

6707.92 --> 6711.4800000000005
that

6708.96 --> 6714.88
then

6711.48 --> 6718.48
kept the price down artificially well

6714.88 --> 6721.88
they can do that with multiple different

6718.48 --> 6725.119
things including the very

6721.88 --> 6727.719
value of the money and basically hold

6725.119 --> 6729.799999999999
back inflation by just like not letting

6727.719 --> 6732.639
the inflation go

6729.8 --> 6735.04
through right got to realize that some

6732.639 --> 6738.2390000000005
of these Mega banks that are involving

6735.04 --> 6741.88
themselves with that they have so much

6738.239 --> 6741.879999999999
money they have so much

6742.8 --> 6748.56
yeah wealth gathered through user and

6745.36 --> 6751.719
all that so much that they could do that

6748.56 --> 6756.079000000001
[Â __Â ] for like a hundred

6751.719 --> 6756.079
years like we can barely

6760.719 --> 6766.56
imagine like they have thousands of

6768.239 --> 6774.799999999999
trillions yeah

6770.36 --> 6776.719
so much like they could just

6774.8 --> 6780.159000000001
completely

6776.719 --> 6783.84
shape the like the values and hold back

6780.159 --> 6783.839999999999
inflation for as long as they

6796.96 --> 6802.0
want oh thanks woodworking gy bear

6799.48 --> 6802.0
thanks a

6807.04 --> 6814.199
lot well thank Phil good

6811.199 --> 6814.199
morning

6828.76 --> 6831.76
welcome

6832.119 --> 6834.759999999999
just those you

6835.8 --> 6843.400000000001
needed well yes of but I mean anybody

6839.639 --> 6845.56
would need it the point is is that

6843.4 --> 6847.638999999999
welfare systems do work when there is

6845.56 --> 6850.52
like control over

6847.639 --> 6852.639
borders like that should be very

6850.52 --> 6855.280000000001
distinct you

6852.639 --> 6858.679
see welfare system can be pretty

6855.28 --> 6860.599
balanced as long as it's very

6858.679 --> 6861.92
strictly

6860.599 --> 6864.679
for

6861.92 --> 6866.4
Citizens and you don't get continual

6864.679 --> 6869.4
influx of

6866.4 --> 6872.759999999999
Outsiders that will very likely get on

6869.4 --> 6875.759999999999
it because then you get like a massive

6872.76 --> 6879.4400000000005
drain so like

6875.76 --> 6882.96
typical current day open border

6879.44 --> 6886.638999999999
craziness with giant migrant influxes

6882.96 --> 6888.32
like and a welfare socialist system like

6886.639 --> 6890.159000000001
that that's like a terrible

6888.32 --> 6894.28
self-destructive combination it's

6890.159 --> 6898.159
forming big problems all over the

6894.28 --> 6900.199
West right but I mean other countries

6898.159 --> 6903.759999999999
like

6900.199 --> 6907.5599999999995
uh that are much more closed bordered

6903.76 --> 6909.079000000001
like Switzerland is very strict on

6907.56 --> 6913.92
its

6909.079 --> 6915.799999999999
uh citizenship entry like they do have

6913.92 --> 6918.4
welfare support

6915.8 --> 6921.599
systems and like they have no problems

6918.4 --> 6921.598999999999
with it

6922.32 --> 6930.159
all you need is just good moneymaking

6927.719 --> 6933.36
citizens and then you can have a couple

6930.159 --> 6935.48
that aren't super successful and it's no

6933.36 --> 6938.839999999999
problem it really

6935.48 --> 6942.119
isn't but if you have continual influx

6938.84 --> 6944.2390000000005
of like giant amounts of people that

6942.119 --> 6947.0
then immediately go on welfare that's

6944.239 --> 6948.598999999999
how you completely break the system and

6947.0 --> 6950.76
that's been happening

6948.599 --> 6953.04
here

6950.76 --> 6957.76
for a while now it's really it has a

6953.04 --> 6961.239
terrible influence so like

6957.76 --> 6961.2390000000005
yeah and that's

6964.96 --> 6971.159
it I'm sorry there's no different from

6967.44 --> 6973.719
homegrown Burns no they are they

6971.159 --> 6973.719
definitely

6978.52 --> 6981.52
different

6998.56 --> 7002.04
okay wood working anywhere

7008.48 --> 7011.48
cool

7128.32 --> 7131.32
e

7192.239 --> 7199.5199999999995
all right so could we now move on to

7195.679 --> 7199.52
another subject this is getting

7218.159 --> 7222.119
tedious

7220.84 --> 7228.32
yes Ben

7222.119 --> 7228.32
Johnston and so are social psychological

7234.8 --> 7242.679
problems do I have in mind I'm not

7239.4 --> 7245.0
sure but like this constant talk like oh

7242.679 --> 7248.28
man we really need to kick out all these

7245.0 --> 7251.119
people on welfare hey thanks man thanks

7248.28 --> 7251.119
thanks a lot

it's official they'll accept it until

8386.0 --> 8391.12
the official says different and then

8388.479 --> 8393.039999999999
suddenly oh we can't trust the official

8391.12 --> 8395.479000000001

8393.04 --> 8397.68
believe lies and that's just what it is
