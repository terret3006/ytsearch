32.729 --> 37.509
[Music]

65.92 --> 71.119
good morning welcome to Flat Earth early

69.479 --> 74.4
bird number

71.119 --> 76.2
1728 I'm your host Arwin and before we

74.4 --> 79.08000000000001
start the show please don't forget to

76.2 --> 81.60000000000001

also do support me through the PayPal

93.88 --> 97.96
and the patreon that will much

95.759 --> 100.759
appreciate and yeah I can always use it

97.96 --> 100.759
so please keep

102.079 --> 107.27999999999999
coming

104.439 --> 108.96
right weather

107.28 --> 113.24
today

108.96 --> 116.88
yeah it was kind of Sunny up to 5

113.24 --> 118.56
minutes ago and then this came

116.88 --> 123.15899999999999
over

118.56 --> 123.159
still it there sun in the distance

123.56 --> 131.959
there but uh yeah it's been a decent day

127.159 --> 131.959
bit cool I I just put my sweater on I'm

132.239 --> 137.08
not going to have my neck muscles get

137.16 --> 141.519
cold and

140.31 --> 144.72
[Music]

141.519 --> 148.44
this it's like stiff muscle type weather

144.72 --> 151.319
if you if you're not careful

148.44 --> 153.72
anyway hello Richard G first in chat

151.319 --> 158.04
Supreme knowing good to see

153.72 --> 163.2
you good to see you in so quick it is

158.04 --> 163.2
Saturday the 23rd of September

165.239 --> 171.28
2023 uh let's check the

169.31 --> 175.68
[Music]

171.28 --> 175.68
temperature 17°

178.76 --> 181.76
right

183.56 --> 187.72
okay according to this tomorrow it will

185.44 --> 190.28
get a bit warmer and sunnier so looking

187.72 --> 190.28
forward to

191.239 --> 199.92000000000002
that right anyway how are you guys

195.36 --> 203.0
doing I'm doing decently well n I'm

199.92 --> 204.55999999999997
doing great actually I'm actually really

203.0 --> 207.56
inspired at this

204.56 --> 207.56
moment

208.68 --> 211.68
cuz

213.12 --> 217.92000000000002
yeah remember that super bll the dash

216.2 --> 220.56
thing the

217.92 --> 223.79899999999998
show well like there's this one guy

220.56 --> 226.28
that's been kind of a baller well seem

223.799 --> 228.28
seemed mostly like a troll I had to

226.28 --> 230.48
delete a lot of his comments it's very

228.28 --> 232.439
annoying but I think he's actually

230.48 --> 235.51899999999998
seriously offering

232.439 --> 239.879
to help make this

235.519 --> 243.28
thing and he's in Germany so that is

239.879 --> 245.56
fairly close at least and I mean yeah I

243.28 --> 248.48
got a really big boost of inspiration

245.56 --> 250.4
for that and been looking through my

248.48 --> 253.07899999999998
stuff and realized

250.4 --> 255.079
that the way that I put it down in there

253.079 --> 257.959
even though it had gone through many

255.079 --> 260.479
Evolutions to basically yeah get it

257.959 --> 264.4
ordered as to what is going to be in

260.479 --> 267.0
there it's still not super well

264.4 --> 268.59999999999997
organized and and the funny thing is I

267.0 --> 273.56
actually

268.6 --> 278.24
blame just that I wasn't that good at it

273.56 --> 278.24
I mean I was very enthusiastic about

278.32 --> 283.36
organizing but I wasn't that great at it

281.4 --> 286.84
focusing on that sort of thing I've

283.36 --> 289.96000000000004
become a lot better in 20 years more

286.84 --> 294.479
than 20 years 25 pretty much cuz that I

289.96 --> 294.479
made this during my teens all of

294.96 --> 300.96
this and then after that yeah

298.56 --> 302.96
just

300.96 --> 305.23999999999995
I got really frustrated because nobody

302.96 --> 308.56
would actually take it serious like

305.24 --> 311.919
nobody had time nobody was eager to

308.56 --> 314.32
actually help me make this

311.919 --> 317.28
thing well to be fair back then

314.32 --> 321.44
programming was a lot TR a lot

317.28 --> 321.44
tougher right than it is

322.8 --> 329.68
now and that kind of made me just like

325.52 --> 332.4
break it off but even today I yeah I got

329.68 --> 336.039
this enthusiastic boost about it and I

332.4 --> 338.19899999999996
just came up with new ideas for it like

336.039 --> 340.12
whoa things that I had never even

338.199 --> 342.91900000000004
thought of that are really simple

340.12 --> 345.6
actually but like that's very doable to

342.919 --> 350.08
put it all in there and then I realized

345.6 --> 355.16
like oh my God like I thought

350.08 --> 357.88
256 different things would suffice but I

355.16 --> 359.91900000000004
mean from just that Glimpse that I got

357.88 --> 363.56
to see I mean is this thing could like

359.919 --> 365.84
really go out of control

363.56 --> 370.599
fast which would make it like an

365.84 --> 374.919
infinitely potential puzzle like really

370.599 --> 376.71999999999997
crazy and like it would just be a game

374.919 --> 379.71999999999997
just to try to

376.72 --> 383.59900000000005
construct complicated mazes like that

379.72 --> 387.16
would be a game because of like

383.599 --> 391.24
unbelievable complexity that can be

387.16 --> 394.8
achieved with it and yeah dude I I am

391.24 --> 399.40000000000003
like really buzzing here with this

394.8 --> 399.40000000000003
[ __ ] hello kumu virus good to see

402.199 --> 407.68
you and I mean I could really do it I'm

405.479 --> 410.8
like I'm almost to the point of

407.68 --> 412.44
enthusiasm that I'm that I might even

410.8 --> 416.44
like try to learn

412.44 --> 416.44
programming I've never had that

418.4 --> 421.4
before

423.8 --> 428.319
but what I'm going to try is to

425.56 --> 431.28000000000003
basically write it down in in an

428.319 --> 434.599
instruction language much better than it

431.28 --> 437.79999999999995
it used to be and really like get all

434.599 --> 439.759
the layers sorted the layers of activity

437.8 --> 442.08
the check routine what it's going to

439.759 --> 444.319
check for how information is going to be

442.08 --> 446.31899999999996
organized in well different branches

444.319 --> 449.40000000000003
right the original W Dash used it just

446.319 --> 451.12
one check routine was very efficient and

449.4 --> 454.12
that was needed because well it needed

451.12 --> 456.199
to work on a commod 64 and if it became

454.12 --> 457.919
too complicated it would never work so

456.199 --> 460.52000000000004
my original Super bow the dash would

457.919 --> 463.56
never have worked on a comer

460.52 --> 466.28
64 unless it was like a naturally beefed

463.56 --> 469.599
up it might have run on an Amega 1200 or

466.28 --> 473.0
something but still it would have

469.599 --> 475.52
probably had complications still but now

473.0 --> 479.879
in this Modern Age where like insane

475.52 --> 482.039
calculation engines are just like dude

479.879 --> 485.12
the overall check routine which could be

482.039 --> 487.8
like vastly like fractally complicated

485.12 --> 491.039
instead of just oh this that this that

487.8 --> 492.28000000000003
this that an entire field checking it

491.039 --> 495.599
that's how it

492.28 --> 499.23999999999995
works it's going to be like oh check o

495.599 --> 502.159
implications then sub check going to go

499.24 --> 504.159
is other sub check other sub check and

502.159 --> 506.479
that could be like with 20 different

504.159 --> 510.08
things and they could connect up and

506.479 --> 513.76
dude like that's a lot of different

510.08 --> 517.519
checks but I mean with this computer age

513.76 --> 520.64
like even a mobile phone could just like

517.519 --> 525.36
have like 20 checks in literally

520.64 --> 529.959
like a microsc n not l a very very short

525.36 --> 535.16
time so like the air era is really there

529.959 --> 538.68
now for a complicated check system right

535.16 --> 540.36
and the funny things is that the game

538.68 --> 544.12
like

540.36 --> 546.44
it's so non Graphics oriented that the

544.12 --> 550.5600000000001
graphics would literally later have to

546.44 --> 553.839
be grafted on as a secondary like a

550.56 --> 555.959
responsing secondary layer Because the

553.839 --> 558.9200000000001
actual routines like they can't be

555.959 --> 562.399
bothered with Graphics it's not

558.92 --> 562.399
relevant so

562.68 --> 567.68
yeah so that you could have a very

565.44 --> 570.12
primitive graphic system for just the

567.68 --> 573.399
development like very passive no

570.12 --> 575.76
animation nothing but with recognizable

573.399 --> 580.6
traits so that it would probably

575.76 --> 582.12
resemble a lot the original commer 64 B

580.6 --> 586.9590000000001
the dash

582.12 --> 590.68
style because that's just like cool and

586.959 --> 593.7199999999999
very easy to do now very very

590.68 --> 595.7199999999999
easy right so that we do wouldn't have

593.72 --> 598.12
to really bother with the graphics for

595.72 --> 601.88
the actual development because Graphics

598.12 --> 603.279
development can be quite a hassle yeah

601.88 --> 605.4399999999999
and there's people out there really good

603.279 --> 607.8
at it too so it's like a thing that we

605.44 --> 610.36
could literally after the system is

607.8 --> 611.4799999999999
programmed like higher and Outsider to

610.36 --> 614.5600000000001
just make the

611.48 --> 617.2
graphics and like if it totally [ __ ]

614.56 --> 618.4399999999999
up it's like oh no problem just discard

617.2 --> 621.6
the

618.44 --> 623.8800000000001
graphics get another Graphics guy like

621.6 --> 625.399
dude I've got this freaking plan out in

623.88 --> 628.24
my head it just

625.399 --> 630.16
manifested it it all only needed this

628.24 --> 632.04
Spark

630.16 --> 635.24
so I really hope the guy's not [ __ ]

632.04 --> 638.079
trolling me but even if he is

635.24 --> 639.639
like well [ __ ] it If he's not going to

638.079 --> 641.5999999999999
if it's not going to work out I'll just

639.639 --> 643.48
have to learn to program it myself I

641.6 --> 646.88
just have to be organized enough about

643.48 --> 650.279
it and hey I got a computer now I didn't

646.88 --> 653.8389999999999
have a an actual like PC like computer

650.279 --> 657.56
with Photoshop and all that back then

653.839 --> 661.8000000000001
did it all on paper guys all of

657.56 --> 663.68
it but I much better organized now

661.8 --> 668.0
and

663.68 --> 668.0
yeah this could be extremely

670.68 --> 675.6389999999999
cool anyway hello issg good to see

687.959 --> 690.959
you

691.36 --> 699.0
yeah I mean akumu virus the game is

694.24 --> 699.0
literally a big calculator that's how it

699.04 --> 704.639
works you just have a you have the level

703.04 --> 707.519
and then

704.639 --> 709.44
every every step which you could think

707.519 --> 711.079
of as a second it all depends on how

709.44 --> 714.0400000000001
much time you're going to give it

711.079 --> 717.4799999999999
because it was even very funny in the

714.04 --> 719.0
old buer Dash in Comer 64 like if a lot

717.48 --> 721.6
of complicated things were happen

719.0 --> 724.079
happening that would literally slow down

721.6 --> 727.0790000000001
the game things would got slower it's

724.079 --> 729.8389999999999
like oh my God SpaceTime is bending too

727.079 --> 732.12
many things are happening and then it's

729.839 --> 735.0400000000001
like who it's almost like a slow-mo

732.12 --> 737.9590000000001
effect it was so funny it's like oh [ __ ]

735.04 --> 739.8389999999999
things are happening so it slowed down

737.959 --> 743.0
because things got more

739.839 --> 745.6800000000001
complicated well

743.0 --> 747.959
unless it was literally nothing

745.68 --> 750.4399999999999
happening and then you would like just

747.959 --> 753.199
be like a turbo racer you would go so

750.44 --> 756.24
fast that like it was too fast to

753.199 --> 758.7199999999999
visually keep track even but then there

756.24 --> 759.9590000000001
was a system also even in the basic

758.72 --> 763.32
construction kit where you could

759.959 --> 765.279
basically slow it all down and then

763.32 --> 767.9590000000001
depending on the level you just like

765.279 --> 770.48
slow it down or not slow it down if a

767.959 --> 773.2399999999999
lot of complicated things can

770.48 --> 776.0
happen it's all designer

773.24 --> 780.12
based but

776.0 --> 782.72
uh yeah that issue should not be there

780.12 --> 785.68
now with this game like unless some

782.72 --> 790.76
weirdo decides like I'm going to make a

785.68 --> 795.519
complicated level that is like absurdly

790.76 --> 798.92
large like 2,000 by 2,000 squares or

795.519 --> 802.44
they like insanely yeah duh then it's

798.92 --> 804.4799999999999
eventually it's going to just slow down

802.44 --> 808.0
again

804.48 --> 811.5600000000001
right if you want to just get bizarre

808.0 --> 813.76
like intely large about it yeah then it

811.56 --> 816.8389999999999
will eventually start to slow down again

813.76 --> 816.8389999999999
and but

822.68 --> 830.04
anyway hard to do with 16 bit games yeah

826.68 --> 830.04
yeah well with 16 bit

832.04 --> 836.079
games it just went

836.199 --> 841.92
smoother but still it could still slow

838.839 --> 846.0790000000001
down but not as much as it would with

841.92 --> 846.079
like with like the eight

849.0 --> 852.199
bits but I mean we're not dealing with

851.48 --> 855.8000000000001
that

852.199 --> 859.24
anymore we're dealing with just insane

855.8 --> 860.959
quickness and it's like 10,000 times

859.24 --> 865.279
quicker now

860.959 --> 867.3599999999999
like while the actual activity of in the

865.279 --> 869.6
game check routine is not going to be

867.36 --> 872.5600000000001
that more complicated

869.6 --> 876.32
not that much it's not like fractally

872.56 --> 878.3199999999999
insane complicated like excessive it's

876.32 --> 880.759
just like oh there's just multiple

878.32 --> 883.72
routines and there's more factors to

880.759 --> 884.88
check but that could all be smoothed out

883.72 --> 887.759
very

884.88 --> 890.48
easily because well it's going to be a

887.759 --> 892.72
very programmer oriented system where

890.48 --> 896.519
first the programmer literally puts

892.72 --> 898.8000000000001
everything into place then when it's

896.519 --> 900.519
decided to work you literally take out

898.8 --> 903.079
all the access

900.519 --> 905.0
data and then that's going to be the

903.079 --> 906.079
program and that's going to be very

905.0 --> 909.519
smooth and

906.079 --> 911.92
quick but from only that

909.519 --> 914.279
raw program that's going to actually be

911.92 --> 916.8
used you wouldn't really be able to like

914.279 --> 919.279
easily reprogram that right that's how

916.8 --> 921.8
it's going to work yeah I really [ __ ]

919.279 --> 923.48
thought about it in so much detail I

921.8 --> 925.68
mean I have talked about it with

923.48 --> 929.9200000000001
programmers I talked about it with my

925.68 --> 932.2399999999999
brother too he was a programmer

929.92 --> 935.8
technically still

932.24 --> 939.29
is don't know if it's very updated

935.8 --> 942.3599999999999
though probably not

939.29 --> 942.36
[Music]

943.36 --> 950.279
anyway it can def yeah no but akumu

946.079 --> 950.279
virus that's a freaking 3D engine

951.04 --> 956.68
[ __ ] like that's not even

953.959 --> 959.8389999999999
involved yeah the game is not going to

956.68 --> 962.399
be 3D engine how about that maybe the

959.839 --> 964.399
graphics will right that all dep like

962.399 --> 967.92
the graphics could be like freaking

964.399 --> 971.04
amazing dude you could like get movie

967.92 --> 973.4799999999999
style Graphics in there even I thought

971.04 --> 977.319
of that like what if like the explosion

973.48 --> 979.279
which is normally just nine dots of in

977.319 --> 981.759
the original like you could literally

979.279 --> 984.4399999999999
make like a fireball explosion out of

981.759 --> 986.279
that and even if that would multiple

984.44 --> 989.399
happen it would just Al it would look

986.279 --> 991.519
really pretty badass

989.399 --> 994.399
like dude there's so many cool graphics

991.519 --> 996.72
you can insert and you could eventually

994.399 --> 998.88
even like just have the raw game and

996.72 --> 1005.0400000000001
then like have different versions of

998.88 --> 1005.04
Graphics even like bro possibilities are

1006.12 --> 1011.399
insane but it's insane because it's not

1009.68 --> 1015.7199999999999
going to be like

1011.399 --> 1018.04
really like Real Time 3D rendered

1015.72 --> 1019.839
[ __ ] yeah because that that's what

1018.04 --> 1023.12
really sucks the energy out of your

1019.839 --> 1027.439
computer a lot of the time it's going to

1023.12 --> 1030.959
be very late 9s

1027.439 --> 1030.959
pre-rendered 3D

1036.439 --> 1042.0790000000002
Graphics cuz that's just much easier to

1040.079 --> 1046.039
do

1042.079 --> 1048.9189999999999
mostly we'll figure it out it's it yeah

1046.039 --> 1050.72
like that's something that yeah I mean

1048.919 --> 1052.7990000000002
I'm not that concerned with the graphics

1050.72 --> 1055.919
part I just know that it's going to be

1052.799 --> 1058.4
it could be made to look in incredible

1055.919 --> 1061.919
this like despite all the

1058.4 --> 1064.88
complexity of the actual

1061.919 --> 1067.1200000000001
game like you could have a total chaos

1064.88 --> 1068.919
Fest like where so many things are

1067.12 --> 1072.6
happening that you just have to press

1068.919 --> 1074.44
space per tradition to pause it and just

1072.6 --> 1077.3999999999999
see like what the [ __ ] is going on on

1074.44 --> 1080.4
the screen like what what the

1077.4 --> 1080.4
hell

1081.4 --> 1086.44
right I mean I am so digging this right

1087.12 --> 1093.9189999999999
now and I also think like because of

1090.0 --> 1093.919
just the technology having caught up

1094.08 --> 1098.6
like like this could really

1101.76 --> 1107.1589999999999
work all right so I'm going to basically

1104.96 --> 1107.159
try

1107.32 --> 1112.1589999999999
to

1109.039 --> 1115.679
perfect the script basically all the

1112.159 --> 1119.6000000000001
units and just like really get

1115.679 --> 1124.2
a basically an instruction bar for every

1119.6 --> 1124.1999999999998
block as to what happens when the check

1124.6 --> 1129.24
comes and then literally write it out

1131.039 --> 1135.6
descriptively and that's like going to

1133.36 --> 1138.36
have like I going to have to have preset

1135.6 --> 1140.799
like every item and then like every

1138.36 --> 1143.039
exception and then how do I over

1140.799 --> 1145.32
simplify these lists so that there's

1143.039 --> 1147.12
just a check marker that needs to be

1145.32 --> 1147.96
checked and you just check the block for

1147.12 --> 1150.039
check

1147.96 --> 1152.799
markers and then based on the check

1150.039 --> 1154.96
markers that they standard

1152.799 --> 1158.48
have

1154.96 --> 1161.44
always the check routine from an item or

1158.48 --> 1163.84
from the general check will respond to

1161.44 --> 1165.799
that so this can

1163.84 --> 1168.039
work

1165.799 --> 1168.9189999999999
anyway are we discussing Flat Earth

1168.039 --> 1170.84
today

1168.919 --> 1174.039
I don't know are we discussing Flat

1170.84 --> 1176.3999999999999
Earth today your your comment was really

1174.039 --> 1180.36
like not great

1176.4 --> 1180.3600000000001
Yoda you suck being

1189.6 --> 1194.48
Yoda Flat Earth not right now well I

1192.559 --> 1196.32
might talk about it but I I am also

1194.48 --> 1200.24
talking about bulad Dash because I'm

1196.32 --> 1200.24
kind of temporarily obsessed by it

1200.48 --> 1205.24
I have having a creative burst which has

1202.919 --> 1209.1200000000001
not happened in a in a

1205.24 --> 1214.4
while very unexpectedly

1209.12 --> 1218.039
too ta bad is it is yeah see a aumu

1214.4 --> 1221.96
virus is a better Yoda than you a kumu

1218.039 --> 1221.96
virus okay look at

1222.91 --> 1230.159
[Music]

1227.159 --> 1230.159
you

1242.52 --> 1248.52
you watched Rachel fight to FL oh W

1245.52 --> 1248.52
congratulations

1248.76 --> 1252.12
o I did

1255.55 --> 1260.12
[Music]

1257.12 --> 1260.12
not

1269.81 --> 1272.99
[Music]

1276.69 --> 1279.969
[Music]

1285.4 --> 1290.039
yeah Sam you said it

1292.59 --> 1295.74
[Music]

1311.12 --> 1317.039
crap careful with that hey slow moon

1314.76 --> 1320.039
buggy good to see

1317.039 --> 1320.039
you

1330.24 --> 1335.679
no that's not correct he would said

1332.64 --> 1338.679
speech everything it

1335.679 --> 1342.679
is can't just always flip it around the

1338.679 --> 1346.279
same then it just becomes like a robot

1342.679 --> 1349.96
Yoda there's a like a pattern to

1346.279 --> 1349.96
it but thank you for

1351.88 --> 1355.64
right hi

1353.88 --> 1361.64
I'm

1355.64 --> 1361.64
K righty dokie then isn't that a little

1363.72 --> 1367.76
early or are you up very

1371.95 --> 1375.19
[Music]

1376.96 --> 1379.96
late

1382.64 --> 1388.72
P two hours oh wow you got one of those

1386.64 --> 1392.24
weird

1388.72 --> 1397.48
ah you got a day night Rhythm uh chaos

1392.24 --> 1400.52
rotation right I used to have a lot of

1397.48 --> 1403.08
those and then I like suddenly like like

1400.52 --> 1406.8799999999999
get really tired go to bed at like

1403.08 --> 1410.4399999999998
8 and then wake up at 4:00 at

1406.88 --> 1413.159
night and then have basically

1410.44 --> 1415.24
like live like that for like four days

1413.159 --> 1418.24
in a row and then it would kind of shift

1415.24 --> 1418.24
again

1422.4 --> 1430.24
weird no I'm not attacking comments I

1425.6 --> 1435.52
just read your comments on my

1430.24 --> 1435.52
videos being very lame and not into

1436.88 --> 1439.88
character

1442.559 --> 1447.72
yeah and hey I can definitely talk about

1444.799 --> 1451.039
Flat Earth but I

1447.72 --> 1454.44
mean I don't like repeating myself over

1451.039 --> 1455.84
and over again and I already do that

1454.44 --> 1458.76
enough as it

1455.84 --> 1460.6399999999999
is right but I have an everyday show I'm

1458.76 --> 1464.279
not just going to freaking talk about

1460.64 --> 1468.3600000000001
Flat Earth every [ __ ] single time

1464.279 --> 1470.48
okay I mean I do will definitely

1468.36 --> 1472.76
talk about it but you can't expect me to

1470.48 --> 1475.6
always just be freaking inspired about

1472.76 --> 1479.44
Flat Earth

1475.6 --> 1479.4399999999998
okay it's not how that

1484.05 --> 1489.76
[Music]

1485.64 --> 1489.76
works new here

1492.64 --> 1495.919
nah hey

1496.76 --> 1502.52
caol

1499.36 --> 1504.279
fpv Angel wants to measure the distance

1502.52 --> 1507.799
to

1504.279 --> 1510.0
rainbows what to find a Taurus field

1507.799 --> 1514.2
what the

1510.0 --> 1518.0
hell whoa dude what the hell is he even

1514.2 --> 1520.88
taking that sounds really trippy

1518.0 --> 1524.6
man bro I'm going to

1520.88 --> 1529.679
like measure the distance to a rainbow

1524.6 --> 1529.6789999999999
man yeah that's one arnian unit

1530.36 --> 1535.0
and

1531.2 --> 1541.3600000000001
then when I measure that distance I'm G

1535.0 --> 1544.32
to find a taus field man holy

1541.36 --> 1548.52
[ __ ] I mean slow-mo Moon buug you're

1544.32 --> 1548.52
joking right it's not literally

1548.96 --> 1551.96
that

1553.08 --> 1559.6789999999999
bro that's some hippie dippy Flat Earth

1556.159 --> 1559.679
[ __ ] right there man

1569.26 --> 1579.079
[Music]

1580.039 --> 1584.559
no but look if somebody wants to try to

1582.64 --> 1587.919
actually create a rainbow well then you

1584.559 --> 1589.2
have to kind of actually try to create

1587.919 --> 1592.6000000000001
it as

1589.2 --> 1596.1200000000001
in the entire effect

1592.6 --> 1597.52
exactly as it yeah with all Prismatic

1596.12 --> 1601.8799999999999
effect

1597.52 --> 1604.799
with the apparent distance situation but

1601.88 --> 1608.679
without using the sunlight you're and

1604.799 --> 1611.52
like the outside like indoors artificial

1608.679 --> 1614.52
lighting somehow get it the effect going

1611.52 --> 1616.6399999999999
and be exactly like rainbow you're not

1614.52 --> 1618.52
going to be able to do it though you

1616.64 --> 1621.039
might create some kind kind of Prismatic

1618.52 --> 1623.799
rainbow effect but it's going to be

1621.039 --> 1623.799
pretty

1625.24 --> 1631.08
local right in reality when you try to

1628.399 --> 1634.12
chase your Rainbow you can't you can't

1631.08 --> 1637.1999999999998
reach it that's the difference because

1634.12 --> 1639.08
it's non-local it's a non-local hologram

1637.2 --> 1641.6000000000001
just like the celestials it's derived

1639.08 --> 1642.6399999999999
from sunlight a non-local hologram as

1641.6 --> 1645.4399999999998
part of the

1642.64 --> 1647.7990000000002
celestials reflected upon water droplets

1645.44 --> 1650.279
but the apparent effect of it is there

1647.799 --> 1652.679
by non-local

1650.279 --> 1655.159
holographic because the light is derived

1652.679 --> 1658.6000000000001
from the Sun and if you try to emulate

1655.159 --> 1659.64
that using local based light systems

1658.6 --> 1663.7199999999998
like

1659.64 --> 1663.72
lamps could use very bright

1664.679 --> 1669.76
ones and then yeah try to recreate it

1667.919 --> 1671.76
you'll create some Prismatic color

1669.76 --> 1673.399
effects but it's going to be very

1671.76 --> 1676.96
different

1673.399 --> 1679.8999999999999
looking i' I have seen that it's not the

1676.96 --> 1685.069
same look doesn't look the

1679.9 --> 1685.0690000000002
[Music]

1688.919 --> 1695.279
same so there you go there's some

1692.2 --> 1695.279
[Music]

1705.48 --> 1711.48
input full spectrum grow

1708.72 --> 1713.96
light yeah those are those can be pretty

1711.48 --> 1716.3600000000001
bright right ca

1713.96 --> 1720.279
Castle but I

1716.36 --> 1723.08
mean if you've seen

1720.279 --> 1724.919
that like very bright light and then you

1723.08 --> 1726.6789999999999
like have water mist or something yeah

1724.919 --> 1729.44
as a grower you'll probably get a lot of

1726.679 --> 1731.039
opportunities to see something like that

1729.44 --> 1733.64
especially if you have high powered

1731.039 --> 1736.6
lamps and all that

1733.64 --> 1739.679
well it doesn't look like a rainbow

1736.6 --> 1742.36
outside now does it it doesn't it

1739.679 --> 1742.3600000000001
doesn't look like

1746.159 --> 1754.159
that glasses are gay viruses are F dude

1750.96 --> 1756.679
yeah but glasses being gay is it's not

1754.159 --> 1759.159
literal dude that's a

1756.679 --> 1762.64
joke but

1759.159 --> 1766.7990000000002
viruses are fake that's definitely

1762.64 --> 1769.44
true kpets never applied they don't

1766.799 --> 1771.399
actually test it it's all derivative

1769.44 --> 1774.3600000000001
based

1771.399 --> 1777.2399999999998
statistic

1774.36 --> 1780.559
management with the presupposition model

1777.24 --> 1784.039
of of a particle that is can spread

1780.559 --> 1785.76
around and do things what never actually

1784.039 --> 1788.44
been

1785.76 --> 1791.76
proven that it even exists or that it

1788.44 --> 1794.96
can do anything it's all derived based

1791.76 --> 1794.96
knowledge hey

1795.0 --> 1800.039
clutch good to see you I had to unban

1798.12 --> 1802.279
you somebody banned you I don't know how

1800.039 --> 1802.279
that

1821.48 --> 1825.64
happened you're not fake

1826.24 --> 1831.35
akumu now akumo is actually real I have

1829.44 --> 1834.54
seen him

1831.35 --> 1834.54
[Music]

1834.799 --> 1838.6
moving photos and

1844.279 --> 1851.679
[ __ ] and of course he has a real voice

1847.72 --> 1851.679
so akumo virus is a real

1853.2 --> 1859.48
person I mean he can act a bit unreal

1856.679 --> 1863.44
especially when the globe gets involved

1859.48 --> 1863.44
but he is flesh and

1867.639 --> 1871.8799999999999
blood or he has that at

1875.42 --> 1878.559
[Music]

1882.84 --> 1888.12
least as I put in my context oh akum

1886.279 --> 1891.679
fireus but I didn't you know that

1888.12 --> 1891.6789999999999
contacts are actually more

1894.72 --> 1899.679
gay but I mean it all depends

1900.6 --> 1905.76
like like glasses being gay is really

1904.0 --> 1908.159
like a thing for the

1905.76 --> 1912.399
Youth

1908.159 --> 1915.3200000000002
right when you're little you should like

1912.399 --> 1918.36
challenge yourself like

1915.32 --> 1921.559
no like train your

1918.36 --> 1924.24
eyes don't just easily rely on glasses

1921.559 --> 1924.24
if you have some

1929.919 --> 1935.679
issues and then if you're lucky you

1933.36 --> 1936.9599999999998
might not need glasses as much when

1935.679 --> 1939.44
you're

1936.96 --> 1941.519
older cuz if you just immediately like

1939.44 --> 1945.519
all surrender like

1941.519 --> 1947.639
oh my eyes are not very good compared to

1945.519 --> 1949.519
others and then just oh put classes on

1947.639 --> 1951.76
like oh I'm almost as good as everybody

1949.519 --> 1954.76
else now and you just well then you

1951.76 --> 1957.24
never really train your

1954.76 --> 1961.279
eyes and then as you get older well

1957.24 --> 1961.279
you're going to have very untrained

1962.6 --> 1967.7199999999998
eyes like I have periods where I have a

1964.84 --> 1971.1999999999998
lot of focusing issues seriously and

1967.72 --> 1975.6000000000001
then I have to make effort and

1971.2 --> 1977.6000000000001
well because I just do that and just

1975.6 --> 1980.32
accept that I have some Focus issues

1977.6 --> 1983.559
with my ey sometimes and it's like a bit

1980.32 --> 1986.9189999999999
of fatigue thing usually I'm kind of

1983.559 --> 1989.039
generally tired when it's like that well

1986.919 --> 1990.7990000000002
because I just like not oh I got I'm

1989.039 --> 1992.2
going to wear glasses today or something

1990.799 --> 1994.9189999999999
I don't even have them I've never even

1992.2 --> 1997.32
went to an eye doctor

1994.919 --> 2001.159
seriously right cuz I know it's just a

1997.32 --> 2004.399
bad Focus day and then you got to make

2001.159 --> 2006.519
yeah it gets back to normal again and

2004.399 --> 2008.76
then I have great Focus days and then

2006.519 --> 2010.039
sometimes it's like holy [ __ ] it's so

2008.76 --> 2013.36
clear it's

2010.039 --> 2016.32
surreal it's like this I have God Vision

2013.36 --> 2016.32
the detail it's

2018.799 --> 2024.1589999999999
crazy everything comes with ups and

2021.2 --> 2027.799
downs it's just how it

2024.159 --> 2030.3600000000001
works mentioned hallucinations he

2027.799 --> 2033.96
probably did wow he actually made an

2030.36 --> 2033.9599999999998
effort to sound like Yoda and his

2035.96 --> 2041.6000000000001
son

2038.84 --> 2043.72
but yeah yeah

2041.6 --> 2047.48
hallucinations that that has happened to

2043.72 --> 2051.0
me and very specific conditions yeah I I

2047.48 --> 2053.679
don't hallucinate

2051.0 --> 2056.52
regularly I mean I get into the Dark

2053.679 --> 2059.639
World stuff or I used to have like

2056.52 --> 2061.119
regular Dark World episodes but that's

2059.639 --> 2064.3990000000003
not like I'm

2061.119 --> 2068.28
sly like oh I'm suddenly seeing things

2064.399 --> 2071.24
during my waking time that don't exist

2068.28 --> 2073.8790000000004
or that I went crazy it's like oh but is

2071.24 --> 2077.2799999999997
there is coming like in front of other

2073.879 --> 2078.919
people no but I did the the worst that

2077.28 --> 2081.639
get out of it is just like whoo there's

2078.919 --> 2084.6389999999997
something weird there's a time in

2081.639 --> 2086.9190000000003
between something in my memory is there

2084.639 --> 2089.639
in between and I can't really place it

2086.919 --> 2093.6389999999997
it's like a dream I had but a dream that

2089.639 --> 2096.04
didn't say it was a dream it was hyper

2093.639 --> 2098.0
realistic and it had people in it and

2096.04 --> 2100.359
Communications and and very interesting

2098.0 --> 2102.44
Communications like almost like they're

2100.359 --> 2104.64
sharing their secrets with me or

2102.44 --> 2108.119
something really

2104.64 --> 2110.0789999999997
bizarre I've had like did I freaking

2108.119 --> 2112.079
read their mind using the Dark World or

2110.079 --> 2115.079
something

2112.079 --> 2115.079
maybe

2117.64 --> 2121.8799999999997
because was that what that

2123.32 --> 2131.2000000000003
was because in there it's like people

2127.32 --> 2131.2000000000003
would just say openly tell me

2133.04 --> 2138.24
everything well in the physical real

2135.359 --> 2139.88
world they wouldn't talk with

2138.24 --> 2142.0
me

2139.88 --> 2146.04
like

2142.0 --> 2149.839
what it was all surreal like but I like

2146.04 --> 2153.079
I didn't really know what was going on

2149.839 --> 2154.4
so whatever that was I didn't really

2153.079 --> 2157.44
understand what was

2154.4 --> 2161.119
happening so I wasn't like affect L

2157.44 --> 2162.56
exploiting like reading people's mind in

2161.119 --> 2165.0
my dreams or

2162.56 --> 2167.48
something I just got interesting

2165.0 --> 2169.52
information out of it I didn't really

2167.48 --> 2171.0
understand it I even confused it with

2169.52 --> 2173.44
people who told them like hey you told

2171.0 --> 2176.0
me all this to be like what the [ __ ] are

2173.44 --> 2176.0
you talking

2176.2 --> 2185.96
about what but I literally remember

2182.4 --> 2188.7200000000003
that that did happen especially around

2185.96 --> 2188.7200000000003
well my

2190.28 --> 2194.28
and I was dwelling in weird I was trying

2192.24 --> 2198.319
to seek it out back then dude I was

2194.28 --> 2201.599
liter like I was just like being

2198.319 --> 2203.24
a I felt like I was being a a plan art

2201.599 --> 2205.3590000000004
traveler and I was literally just

2203.24 --> 2207.8799999999997
actively walking the other side and I

2205.359 --> 2212.319
tried to get there and all that

2207.88 --> 2215.359
and but I did actually get there you see

2212.319 --> 2218.68
other people wouldn't see that but I did

2215.359 --> 2218.68
actually experience it

2222.01 --> 2225.2290000000003
[Music]

2225.72 --> 2230.9599999999996
but it's not really happening anymore

2227.68 --> 2233.48
now like I've become a lot more stable

2230.96 --> 2238.2400000000002
because I was

2233.48 --> 2240.359
unstable also now did the instability B

2238.24 --> 2242.72
you could say instability allows that

2240.359 --> 2246.04
sort of thing to manifest and the thing

2242.72 --> 2252.04
is is those things manifesting are

2246.04 --> 2252.04
probably like potentially very dangerous

2254.119 --> 2259.04
psychologically and it is yeah I mean

2257.72 --> 2262.0
generally it is known that

2259.04 --> 2266.24
hallucinations are like a sign of

2262.0 --> 2268.68
damage of strain that basically is doing

2266.24 --> 2272.52
damage and then hallucination happens as

2268.68 --> 2274.1189999999997
a side effect right now it didn't feel

2272.52 --> 2279.079
like it was just a continual

2274.119 --> 2281.76
hallucination damaging me but I was more

2279.079 --> 2284.92
sensitive while in the Dark World while

2281.76 --> 2286.6400000000003
in that state not that I could like have

2284.92 --> 2289.599
physical damage but I could have

2286.64 --> 2289.5989999999997
psychological

2294.0 --> 2298.8
damage hallucinations are memory

2299.28 --> 2302.28
driven

2305.52 --> 2308.52
uh

2310.4 --> 2317.119
usually but what hallucinations usually

2313.16 --> 2321.8799999999997
are is like the imagination

2317.119 --> 2324.6400000000003
system isn't compartmentalizing itself

2321.88 --> 2326.6800000000003
properly so what could typically happen

2324.64 --> 2329.04
as a Hallucination is what happens as a

2326.68 --> 2330.72
Hallucination is like it's there to

2329.04 --> 2333.44
escape from the situation which is

2330.72 --> 2336.0789999999997
painful in a way

2333.44 --> 2338.88
psychologically so then it starts up but

2336.079 --> 2342.48
if you're really also at the same time

2338.88 --> 2344.88
very focused like because of fear for

2342.48 --> 2346.64
example of what could happen what could

2344.88 --> 2349.52
go wrong and you're really focused on

2346.64 --> 2352.16
staying paying attention well then

2349.52 --> 2354.68
you're both accidentally trying to

2352.16 --> 2357.7599999999998
escape into a dream state and paying

2354.68 --> 2359.96
hyper attention well guess what if it

2357.76 --> 2362.6800000000003
then still triggers you could it could

2359.96 --> 2364.48
accidentally overlap because you're not

2362.68 --> 2366.96
switching

2364.48 --> 2368.64
properly and that is literally what can

2366.96 --> 2370.44
create such a hallucination I've

2368.64 --> 2374.04
experienced

2370.44 --> 2378.7200000000003
that when it was actually

2374.04 --> 2381.44
hallucination actual like waking and not

2378.72 --> 2385.1189999999997
a dark World Vision

2381.44 --> 2385.119
thing in it

2386.56 --> 2393.119
yeah I had it a couple of times like

2390.04 --> 2398.4
after my ex broke up with me I still

2393.119 --> 2398.4
live there I was in a really bad spot

2399.16 --> 2405.0
right and then that would

2401.88 --> 2407.0
happen cuz there wasn't one side

2405.0 --> 2411.96
desperately trying to uphold the dream

2407.0 --> 2411.96
to like try to get her to tap back into

2414.4 --> 2419.44
it and then sometimes that went

2420.4 --> 2424.96
wrong cuz it was like a constant tug of

2423.04 --> 2427.24
war like in the other dimension like

2424.96 --> 2428.7200000000003
that very strenuous

2427.24 --> 2430.359
it's like I'm trying to uphold a dream

2428.72 --> 2433.2
that's being actively attacked by the

2430.359 --> 2436.68
one that's supposed to be part of

2433.2 --> 2439.2799999999997
it and like she really resented me for

2436.68 --> 2442.0789999999997
it eventually because I really couldn't

2439.28 --> 2442.079
I wouldn't let

2446.319 --> 2452.119
go took me years to really Let It

2454.4 --> 2461.48
Go like even a year after she after she

2458.079 --> 2464.76
had thrown me out basically I still had

2461.48 --> 2467.44
like this weird fake hope that she might

2464.76 --> 2473.1600000000003
regret it and then show back up right

2467.44 --> 2473.16
terrible [ __ ] so yeah let it go is very

2473.839 --> 2481.0
difficult and when it's super

2477.16 --> 2481.0
strenuous then you might

2485.24 --> 2488.24
hallucinate

2491.16 --> 2496.3999999999996
how does one that has altered thoughts

2494.2 --> 2500.2
of or Vision measure

2496.4 --> 2502.76
Reality by how things feel and by just

2500.2 --> 2507.0
the fine workings of your sensory it's

2502.76 --> 2509.1600000000003
just it's a ratio system it's just

2507.0 --> 2511.16
what's the overall setup and then

2509.16 --> 2514.04
compare it what was the overall setup

2511.16 --> 2516.64
that I remember experiencing last and

2514.04 --> 2518.839
then you basically tap into how how does

2516.64 --> 2521.68
my memory actually work in this day

2518.839 --> 2524.16
because guess what it works

2521.68 --> 2526.52
differently totally

2524.16 --> 2527.96
different in there in the dark world

2526.52 --> 2530.4
it's really weird it's like you're

2527.96 --> 2530.4
another

2531.56 --> 2537.0
person it's like time is different when

2535.119 --> 2540.76
you're in the Dark World you remember

2537.0 --> 2540.76
back to other Dark World

2542.0 --> 2549.4
things you can't connect it linearly to

2545.8 --> 2552.6800000000003
to the time experience in the waking

2549.4 --> 2557.0
world you can't connect it there is no

2552.68 --> 2557.0
connection it's a separate reality it's

2568.48 --> 2573.28
parallel so like when I'm in the dark

2571.319 --> 2576.4
world I'm thinking back

2573.28 --> 2579.8390000000004
hey what do I remember last well where

2576.4 --> 2582.4
your memory takes you tells you

2579.839 --> 2585.0789999999997
everything cuz if my memory doesn't

2582.4 --> 2587.559
typically comport with the general

2585.079 --> 2590.319
function which there is a feedback

2587.559 --> 2593.48
there's like a marker for that in my

2590.319 --> 2594.5589999999997
program for what is my general state of

2593.48 --> 2597.319
doing

2594.559 --> 2600.119
things completely untime bound but just

2597.319 --> 2601.7599999999998
by linear experience like where is it is

2600.119 --> 2605.079
almost like

2601.76 --> 2607.3590000000004
a like a meter or what is

2605.079 --> 2610.1600000000003
it

2607.359 --> 2613.0
almost like a pressure meter gauge thing

2610.16 --> 2614.72
bar barometer or something and then it's

2613.0 --> 2619.04
just like oh looking back in the memory

2614.72 --> 2622.0
and then does that compart with last

2619.04 --> 2623.96
measurement no it points at completely

2622.0 --> 2626.839
different things that are mystifying me

2623.96 --> 2629.88
in relation to that so I must be in the

2626.839 --> 2629.88
dark world again

2633.28 --> 2637.88
then and the last parts of the

2635.68 --> 2639.5589999999997
experience I became a lot more efficient

2637.88 --> 2641.6400000000003
at it because in the beginning I

2639.559 --> 2644.4
literally didn't even know how to check

2641.64 --> 2646.0099999999998
I didn't even realize it was not normal

2644.4 --> 2649.089
physical

2646.01 --> 2649.0890000000004
[Music]

2649.72 --> 2652.72
reality

2657.48 --> 2663.559
anyway s don't do that caprico don't

2660.88 --> 2663.559
bring that up

2663.599 --> 2671.4
please that's really bad

2666.92 --> 2673.8
bad stuff I don't want 12y olds to learn

2671.4 --> 2673.8
about

2688.28 --> 2692.8390000000004
that what okay the

2694.96 --> 2697.96
[ __ ]

2707.96 --> 2713.98
[Music]

2724.88 --> 2727.88
oh

2730.77 --> 2733.82
[Music]

2740.599 --> 2745.2000000000003
right but I mean yeah if you're going

2742.559 --> 2747.2000000000003
Dimension hopping or tripping your balls

2745.2 --> 2749.5989999999997
off with some drugs or whatever you're

2747.2 --> 2749.5989999999997
into

2749.8 --> 2754.88
that the best test to orient yourself is

2753.2 --> 2757.8799999999997
what do I last

2754.88 --> 2757.88
remember

2758.96 --> 2761.92
what's the last thing I

2767.42 --> 2770.5190000000002
[Music]

2775.2 --> 2782.1189999999997
remember visit the Dark World often do

2778.04 --> 2782.119
no no I'm not going back there

2782.24 --> 2788.2
dude there's show titles even saying I'm

2786.359 --> 2791.839
not going back to the Dark World from

2788.2 --> 2791.839
years ago so

2792.359 --> 2799.68
no and besides I don't need

2796.64 --> 2802.64
to there's nothing I could accomplish

2799.68 --> 2803.96
there

2802.64 --> 2806.5589999999997
[Music]

2803.96 --> 2809.4
further or rather by having my

2806.559 --> 2812.6400000000003
Consciousness being there

2809.4 --> 2814.8
actively I'm going to just leave it do

2812.64 --> 2817.7999999999997
what it

2814.8 --> 2817.8
does

2820.04 --> 2823.92
what hello gzilla what are you talking

2828.04 --> 2836.4
about obscure hallucinations the guy who

2831.599 --> 2840.44
wrote Hellraiser well yeah well

2836.4 --> 2843.64
hey I mean Hellraiser 2o you

2840.44 --> 2843.64
know that

2844.48 --> 2847.72
was in

2848.4 --> 2854.2400000000002
interesting I'm I'm very sure that they

2925.559 --> 2931.079
much younger I also kind of used it that

2928.2 --> 2933.359
way yeah and that was in secret it's

2931.079 --> 2937.28
like the response to being bullied

2933.359 --> 2940.04
almost when I was

2937.28 --> 2940.92
kid that I could get so worked up over

2940.04 --> 2944.04
that

2940.92 --> 2947.4
so stressed out demoralized that I would

2944.04 --> 2950.52
literally start to well get those dreams

2947.4 --> 2952.92
and then I could be like a complete like

2950.52 --> 2956.64
a wolverine just like ripping things

2952.92 --> 2956.64
apart and [ __ ] with my

2968.319 --> 2972.72
that that was just like in my

3237.24 --> 3243.52
I agree to that dusk I mean this sounds

3240.559 --> 3246.28
weird but cannabis literally changed my

brain like I it made me capable of

3246.28 --> 3252.3590000000004
talking properly and elaborately

3250.0 --> 3257.079
literally it started

would rant on about ideas sometimes but

3259.24 --> 3262.4399999999996
always like end up getting frustrated

3261.16 --> 3264.8799999999997
and getting

3262.44 --> 3267.28
chaotic and then when I smoke cannabis

3264.88 --> 3271.04
for the first time first few times I

3267.28 --> 3274.799
found that I could suddenly talk very

3271.04 --> 3277.319
calmly in order and not go out of

3274.799 --> 3280.24
control with my

3277.319 --> 3284.4

3280.24 --> 3284.3999999999996

4248.52 --> 4253.1990000000005
the point that I have to throw

4250.76 --> 4255.159000000001
up that's what happens with the VR

4253.199 --> 4257.719
headset

4255.159 --> 4259.92
or at least the the time that last time

4257.719 --> 4259.92
I

4261.44 --> 4266.879999999999
tried I don't even want to think back to

4264.04 --> 4266.88
that right

4269.64 --> 4274.679
now but

4272.0 --> 4277.32
uh no I thankfully I never have that

4274.679 --> 4277.32
issue with my

4282.56 --> 4287.6990000000005
monitors

4283.93 --> 4287.6990000000005
[Music]

4289.84 --> 4298.4400000000005
yeah hey akum how about not not

4294.56 --> 4302.159000000001
like reminding us about that right

4298.44 --> 4305.48
now thank you I'm trying to like not

4302.159 --> 4305.48
remember that [ __ ]

4312.56 --> 4315.56
okay

4324.76 --> 4332.76
so yeah I've gotten very sick from 3D

4328.12 --> 4334.3099999999995
[ __ ] A Plenty even from like just 3D

4332.76 --> 4335.96
games on the

4334.31 --> 4338.92
[Music]

4335.96 --> 4340.88
screen and I really started notice that

4338.92 --> 4344.32
it was getting really bad for the first

4340.88 --> 4347.28
time with the uh with

4344.32 --> 4350.199
halflife especially halflife 2 that one

4347.28 --> 4352.5599999999995
really like broke it for me it was it's

4350.199 --> 4353.759999999999
so beautiful realistic looking but it

4352.56 --> 4357.320000000001
was like too

4353.76 --> 4359.719
much and it's like super tense and it

4357.32 --> 4361.88
[ __ ] me up and then it literally make

4359.719 --> 4365.159
me throw

4361.88 --> 4369.159000000001
up and after that I I like set like

4365.159 --> 4371.12
swore off like 3D games I'm like I'm not

4369.159 --> 4373.0
doing this [ __ ] anymore it's like oh so

4371.12 --> 4375.639
realistic and now makes literally makes

4373.0 --> 4380.44
me throw up I'm not doing that

4375.639 --> 4380.4400000000005
anymore so I literally don't do that

4391.88 --> 4396.2390000000005
anymore what the [ __ ] T that's

4402.36 --> 4408.12
weird

4404.719 --> 4408.12
right I I think I know what you

4408.159 --> 4415.5599999999995
mean yeah well Tusk basically when I

4412.48 --> 4418.159
don't feel great when I say that I feel

4415.56 --> 4420.92
wonky well that that effect that you're

4418.159 --> 4424.36
describing proximal vertical that is

4420.92 --> 4425.159
kind of what is starting to happen then

4424.36 --> 4428.32
with

4425.159 --> 4430.599999999999
me but I'm not super sensitive to it it

4428.32 --> 4433.36
only happens when I'm kind of

4430.6 --> 4435.4400000000005
wonky it's like I get under tension and

4433.36 --> 4438.4
and then when I get under tension then

4435.44 --> 4438.4
that [ __ ] can

4442.96 --> 4448.36
happen and then sometimes like I have to

4445.56 --> 4451.120000000001
step away get a bre breather that's

4448.36 --> 4453.04
usually when I do that spontaneously

4451.12 --> 4454.639
because of what's happening in the chat

4453.04 --> 4455.48
that's usually because I'm getting what

4454.639 --> 4458.0
you're

4455.48 --> 4462.4
describing

4458.0 --> 4463.88
although I can prevent the actual visual

4462.4 --> 4466.638999999999
effect of the

4463.88 --> 4468.92
vertigo that part I can literally stop

4466.639 --> 4468.92
that

4470.08 --> 4474.84
actively it only happens like that if I

4472.88 --> 4478.12
like wake up and it's

4474.84 --> 4479.96
happening cuz then I didn't focus on

4478.12 --> 4482.4
preventing that from happening as it

4479.96 --> 4482.4
started

4484.92 --> 4492.28
up high blood pressure can trigger it

4488.4 --> 4496.04
no I don't have high blood

4492.28 --> 4498.84
pressure have exceptionally low blood

4496.04 --> 4502.44
pressure sometimes otherwise I wouldn't

4498.84 --> 4502.4400000000005
survive eating so much

4505.44 --> 4508.62
[Music]

4516.0 --> 4522.199
salt you're not afraid of heights only

4518.84 --> 4527.08
width okay Ste

4522.199 --> 4527.08
Trev get it checked

4530.76 --> 4535.2390000000005
no there are some yeah you know what the

4533.159 --> 4538.5599999999995
best treatment

4535.239 --> 4538.5599999999995
is not

4538.88 --> 4544.84
drinking not overstressing

4542.159 --> 4546.679
yourself like not being demoralized and

4544.84 --> 4548.679
overstressing yourself that way because

4546.679 --> 4551.04
that typically makes you

4548.679 --> 4554.159
wonky and making sure you don't go to

4551.04 --> 4555.92
bed too late by keeping yourself up

4554.159 --> 4557.799999999999
because you're so enthusiastic about

4555.92 --> 4562.2390000000005
something that can definitely wait till

4557.8 --> 4565.0
the next day yeah those factors if I get

4562.239 --> 4567.599999999999
that all under control then I don't get

4565.0 --> 4570.12
wonky well I got the alcohol under

4567.6 --> 4572.52
control I'm definitely not using alcohol

4570.12 --> 4574.8
anymore so the amount of wonkiness has

4572.52 --> 4577.6
like decreased by

4574.8 --> 4580.639
90% since

4577.6 --> 4583.679
then I still sometimes go to bed a bit

4580.639 --> 4586.32
late and then I have little w

4583.679 --> 4588.36
risk but I mean because I don't drink on

4586.32 --> 4591.719
top of that like it barely even

4588.36 --> 4593.799999999999
manifests so you could say stopping

4591.719 --> 4598.92
drinking

4593.8 --> 4598.92
beers fixed most of my wonkiness

4604.08 --> 4610.28
problem yeah and yes I did actually go

4606.92 --> 4614.2390000000005
to bed pretty damn late this

4610.28 --> 4616.759999999999
night so I am having

4614.239 --> 4620.12
a bit of wonkiness but not enough to

4616.76 --> 4620.12
like send me really

4620.199 --> 4625.28
spiraling right but yeah when I say

4622.4 --> 4627.08
wonky it's usually that that effect what

4625.28 --> 4631.36
you're describing except it's not

4627.08 --> 4631.36
Advanced I I got it mostly under

4632.0 --> 4637.12
control get a pounding in my ears before

4634.88 --> 4641.0
it starts

4637.12 --> 4641.0
spinning well that's the blood

4642.0 --> 4645.0
shift

4648.8 --> 4653.28
yeah but that

4654.639 --> 4659.56
yeah but that is kind of like a panic

4657.56 --> 4662.88
effect what you're describing

4659.56 --> 4664.120000000001
then I don't have that thank God I don't

4662.88 --> 4668.400000000001
have

4664.12 --> 4671.0
that now with me the way it announces is

4668.4 --> 4674.0
very much like right here right in

4671.0 --> 4676.239
between here I get like a

4674.0 --> 4678.0
a sort of disturbance in the force type

4676.239 --> 4680.44
feel I don't know how else to describe

4678.0 --> 4683.199
it it's just like a it's like a sign

4680.44 --> 4685.839999999999
like a vibration of some kind that I

4683.199 --> 4690.48
really feel in my

4685.84 --> 4690.4800000000005
head that's like oh

4692.76 --> 4698.52
oh I have to be careful that's how it

4696.44 --> 4701.28
announces it I don't I don't get any

4698.52 --> 4701.280000000001
other type

4701.639 --> 4705.400000000001
symptoms it doesn't have like a

4703.679 --> 4710.159
pre-announcement it's just immediately

4705.4 --> 4712.159
like like I'm wonky like oh you can't

4710.159 --> 4714.5199999999995
just keep pushing it that's basically

4712.159 --> 4714.5199999999995
what that

4718.65 --> 4725.32
[Music]

4720.56 --> 4725.320000000001
means anxiety tightness in the

4726.639 --> 4733.52
throat right but I mean it is yeah

4729.76 --> 4737.88
anxiety is very specific right but it is

4733.52 --> 4737.88
a similar reaction it's like

4737.96 --> 4745.56
a a switch that happens but in this case

4743.199 --> 4748.159
involuntarily so it's like your body

4745.56 --> 4751.679
chooses to react and you don't get a say

4748.159 --> 4751.679
over it right it's not

4757.679 --> 4761.84
good that basically means you don't have

4760.28 --> 4766.12
it under control

4761.84 --> 4766.12
in if it happens like

4766.4 --> 4772.08
that I have it under control I just am a

4769.44 --> 4774.199
little weakened sometimes and then I

4772.08 --> 4776.76
call that wonky and then it's like oh I

4774.199 --> 4780.159
just can't push myself as

4776.76 --> 4784.04
far that includes emotionally I can't

4780.159 --> 4785.759999999999
get as excited as I might want to become

4784.04 --> 4788.159
because getting excited basically

4785.76 --> 4790.1990000000005
creates more energy and then that

4788.159 --> 4791.839999999999
pressurizes the wonkiness and then it

4790.199 --> 4794.839999999999
can get

4791.84 --> 4794.84
sick

4804.719 --> 4811.6
right tightness in your throat well well

4808.96 --> 4815.44
that's like that's not even anxiety

4811.6 --> 4817.6
that's like a social effect which can

4815.44 --> 4819.239
lead to anxiety but it's like when

4817.6 --> 4822.320000000001
you're like

4819.239 --> 4824.759999999999
suddenly like really publicly humiliated

4822.32 --> 4824.759999999999
or something

4827.239 --> 4832.599999999999
like that you're you're socially burnt

4830.76 --> 4834.719
like you're you got to a position where

4832.6 --> 4838.679
you're going to be burnt socially not

4834.719 --> 4842.199
literally right and then yeah oh [ __ ]

4838.679 --> 4845.1990000000005
right it's like oh I [ __ ] up

4842.199 --> 4848.48
but I don't necessarily associate it

4845.199 --> 4848.48
with actual

4848.6 --> 4854.159000000001
anxiety although

4851.719 --> 4857.2390000000005
yeah

4854.159 --> 4862.44
it's also because it's so long

4857.239 --> 4865.5599999999995
ago like I hate anxiety like like

4862.44 --> 4867.12
maniacally for myself like experiencing

4865.56 --> 4870.4800000000005
it I don't like when other people

4867.12 --> 4873.08
experience it because it does actually

4870.48 --> 4875.44
resonate but I don't

4873.08 --> 4878.719
like get aggressive against it or

4875.44 --> 4878.719
anything I know it only makes it

4879.08 --> 4883.679
worse

4881.639 --> 4887.12
but

4883.679 --> 4890.2390000000005
I banished anxiety from myself I took

4887.12 --> 4890.239
risks to banish

4894.8 --> 4901.2390000000005
it it's like I just I don't allow myself

4899.32 --> 4906.199
to have an anxious

4901.239 --> 4908.08
reaction I only get anxious reactions

4906.199 --> 4911.5199999999995
post-traumatic like when there's when

4908.08 --> 4914.96
it's safe then it might come out like as

4911.52 --> 4918.040000000001
a response as like that was kept inside

4914.96 --> 4921.4800000000005
and then like ah [ __ ] what the [ __ ] did

4918.04 --> 4924.56
just happen right but like when it's

4921.48 --> 4927.239
actually there I never [ __ ] lose my

4924.56 --> 4928.76
cool I don't do that I don't allow like

4927.239 --> 4931.199
especially when it's actually a

4928.76 --> 4934.320000000001
dangerous situation like I'm not going

4931.199 --> 4934.32
to be panicking

4936.76 --> 4941.92
ever like unless I'm like somewhere and

4939.84 --> 4944.28
suddenly [ __ ] would blow up out of

4941.92 --> 4946.52
nowhere and Ed yeah then I'll freaking

4944.28 --> 4950.36
panic because it's just a total shock

4946.52 --> 4954.320000000001
right I might Panic what the [ __ ] but I

4950.36 --> 4956.599999999999
will like like suppress that adrenaline

4954.32 --> 4960.12
to like whoa what the [ __ ] is happened

4956.6 --> 4962.92
okay plan go now who am I going to pull

4960.12 --> 4964.92
with me plan go flee immediately and I

4962.92 --> 4966.88
will get to order very quickly and I

4964.92 --> 4969.56
will get militant very quickly I will

4966.88 --> 4973.36
then help Shake other people out of it

4969.56 --> 4976.280000000001
quickly right but only in total

4973.36 --> 4980.36
unexpected heavy shock like a massive

4976.28 --> 4982.679
situ massive explosion like will I even

4980.36 --> 4986.199
have any kind of

4982.679 --> 4988.639
preliminary anxiety reaction like

4986.199 --> 4991.638999999999
that I

4988.639 --> 4991.639
panic

4993.48 --> 4998.839999999999
right the only places where I might

4996.56 --> 5001.1990000000005
still have a bit of anxiety and it's

4998.84 --> 5005.08
like the worst place to have it is

5001.199 --> 5008.28
like with some women like women that I

5005.08 --> 5010.84
find absurdly attractive which happens

5008.28 --> 5012.96
unfortunately more than I like

5010.84 --> 5015.96
sometimes but that I like have

5012.96 --> 5017.719
absolutely no idea what to do with them

5015.96 --> 5020.159
and then I'm just like I'm super

5017.719 --> 5022.44
attracted but that's also like like

5020.159 --> 5025.96
that's [ __ ]

5022.44 --> 5030.0
dangerous like if I allow myself to fall

5025.96 --> 5033.2390000000005
in love with that I am going to [ __ ]

5030.0 --> 5037.32
die that does like yeah there's some

5033.239 --> 5040.759999999999
anxious or anxiousness there

5037.32 --> 5042.96
sometimes I don't like that but I mean

5040.76 --> 5042.96
it

5044.6 --> 5051.159000000001
does like it's like super attractive

5048.04 --> 5052.92
girls like that you got to be so I me

5051.159 --> 5056.199
personally have to be so careful with

5052.92 --> 5058.76
that to like I really know who they are

5056.199 --> 5060.96
before I allow myself to fall in love

5058.76 --> 5064.400000000001
with

5060.96 --> 5066.44
that because could like very easily turn

5064.4 --> 5068.4
out to be completely different of what I

5066.44 --> 5071.36
would have

5068.4 --> 5073.159
expected it's very important very

5071.36 --> 5074.799999999999
attractive girls to really know what

5073.159 --> 5077.199
they're on what they're like on the

5074.8 --> 5079.52
inside

5077.199 --> 5083.36
before I dare

5079.52 --> 5083.360000000001
to tango with

5086.83 --> 5094.36
[Music]

5088.4 --> 5094.36
that anyway h i maneuvered it to dating

5094.92 --> 5098.1990000000005
isn't that much better than

5100.76 --> 5105.0
drugs plenty of kicks with

5113.679 --> 5118.4
that all right anyway thanks for sharing

5116.119 --> 5118.4
all

5120.52 --> 5125.4400000000005
that the information it's very

5123.36 --> 5127.599999999999
interesting to talk about it so I do

5125.44 --> 5130.32
appreciate you sharing

5127.6 --> 5133.2390000000005
that like what are symptoms like what is

5130.32 --> 5133.239
that really how do you

5133.52 --> 5139.6
respond it's good to to know that to

5136.88 --> 5143.2390000000005
know these things about

5139.6 --> 5145.360000000001
yourself and to be reminded about it put

5143.239 --> 5148.32
that preferably in a way that it you

5145.36 --> 5149.839999999999
don't literally have it triggered right

5148.32 --> 5151.679
because if you could talk about it

5149.84 --> 5154.1990000000005
without it being triggered well then you

5151.679 --> 5159.4400000000005
can like Master it even

5154.199 --> 5159.44
further it's all about how do you

5159.96 --> 5166.92
like create grow the majority of having

5164.4 --> 5169.879999999999
it over under control versus having to

5166.92 --> 5172.56
brace to keep it under control

5169.88 --> 5174.92
right first you usually start with

5172.56 --> 5176.92
mostly bracing to keep it under control

5174.92 --> 5179.92
and maybe here and there talking about

5176.92 --> 5183.8
it without triggering it but you got to

5179.92 --> 5186.719
widen that amount more capable of

5183.8 --> 5188.679
talking about it versus times where you

5186.719 --> 5191.4800000000005
have to brace to keep it under control

5188.679 --> 5193.719
and that's always the task so that you

5191.48 --> 5195.599999999999
eventually Master it so well that you

5193.719 --> 5198.08
never have to brace to keep it under

5195.6 --> 5198.08
control

5198.119 --> 5201.759999999999
again and that is

5202.44 --> 5207.96
achievable with these kinds of things

5205.719 --> 5212.88
but it requires some

5207.96 --> 5216.04
dedication and especially like uh

5212.88 --> 5218.76
decision like you it has to be a mission

5216.04 --> 5221.96
for you personal mission you have to

5218.76 --> 5227.08
really take it serious and then you

5221.96 --> 5227.08
can anyway never been on a date

5230.04 --> 5234.92
really never went to a movie or for a

5233.56 --> 5237.639
meal or anything like

5234.92 --> 5240.639
[Music]

5237.639 --> 5240.639

5241.119 --> 5248.28

5245.88 --> 5251.119
that with my

5248.28 --> 5253.159
girlfriends or at least at first and

5251.119 --> 5257.679
then kind of when I got into like the

5253.159 --> 5262.08
gothic scene I it kind of turned into

5257.679 --> 5262.08
just seeing what you bump into

5265.44 --> 5270.119
and but I really appreciated the actual

5268.6 --> 5272.6
dating I like

5270.119 --> 5275.08
dating like I I like the part where

5272.6 --> 5278.4400000000005
you're like yeah you're being seen

5275.08 --> 5281.48
together in public I like

5278.44 --> 5283.32
that when I'm with a a woman I'm usually

5281.48 --> 5286.599999999999
kind of proud to be with

5283.32 --> 5289.08
her or I wouldn't really pick somebody

5286.6 --> 5292.88
like that I don't pick women like oh I

5289.08 --> 5294.0

5292.88 --> 5296.6
to

5294.0 --> 5300.119
be publicly seen with

5296.6 --> 5304.04
them and I had one exception with that

5300.119 --> 5304.04
but even her with like the

5305.4 --> 5308.5599999999995
yeah not too pretty face but the rest

5307.28 --> 5311.04

5308.56 --> 5313.159000000001
fine even her I wasn't technically

5311.04 --> 5315.88
ashamed to be seen with her publicly

5313.159 --> 5318.08
it's just that like I wasn't really

5315.88 --> 5320.84
going to be in love with

5318.08 --> 5323.88
her and she was probably going to be

5320.84 --> 5326.6

that there's a

6105.08 --> 6110.36
reason you don't just go saying oh don't

blend the Fabrics unless there is a

evidence

6111.8 --> 6117.84
reason why they wouldn't want to do

6115.48 --> 6121.638999999999
it why it's

6117.84 --> 6123.8
bad they just don't just randomly decide

6121.639 --> 6126.119
oh you're you're not allowed to do this

6123.8 --> 6129.159000000001
because of God they don't just randomly

6126.119 --> 6129.159
say that

6130.199 --> 6135.919999999999
okay when these kinds of supposed laws

6133.56 --> 6139.8
or statements are made that's always

6135.92 --> 6141.84
because well that's they figured out

6139.8 --> 6144.04
about it like there something bad going

6141.84 --> 6148.8
on there's some negative result that's

6144.04 --> 6153.08
it's basically a very very early form of

6148.8 --> 6155.28
science very early not method but it is

6153.08 --> 6159.28
a method it's just

6155.28 --> 6162.88
like H there's something going on

6159.28 --> 6165.719
here bad things are happening could it

6162.88 --> 6168.08
be this could it be that and they just

6165.719 --> 6170.04
test it like oh and then when they

6168.08 --> 6172.04
figure it out like hey it was when

6170.04 --> 6175.04
everybody stopped was ordered to stop

6172.04 --> 6177.88
eating this for a while then suddenly

6175.04 --> 6180.76
like the amount of sickness went down

6177.88 --> 6183.88
dramatically well they conclude well I

6180.76 --> 6187.88
guess God doesn't want us to eat that

6183.88 --> 6189.92
then trial and error it's sort of a

6187.88 --> 6191.88
cause and effect relationship it's just

6189.92 --> 6194.84
that well that just means that God

6191.88 --> 6197.4400000000005
doesn't want us to do that that's how I

6194.84 --> 6199.08
interpret these things so there would

6197.44 --> 6201.239
have always been a reason they don't

6199.08 --> 6204.679
just randomly say like

6201.239 --> 6206.678999999999
oh you shall not use these types of

6204.679 --> 6209.679
plants out of

6206.679 --> 6212.0
nowhere because God forbids it no no no

6209.679 --> 6216.2390000000005
that's got to have a reason why that

6212.0 --> 6219.199
wasn't allowed then what was it doing

6216.239 --> 6221.4
what was it doing to people that that

6219.199 --> 6224.719
would be the conclusions that it's like

6221.4 --> 6227.92
punished by God when you take that right

6224.719 --> 6232.679
very primitive early form of scientific

6227.92 --> 6232.679
method with God in it

6236.96 --> 6240.44
yeah God doesn't want us to have sex out

6238.48 --> 6243.879999999999
of wedlock yeah right why why would that

6240.44 --> 6248.159
be could it be because when people would

6243.88 --> 6250.679
just do that lots of like spousal

6248.159 --> 6253.5599999999995
homicides would happen

6250.679 --> 6256.119
yeah and that's why God doesn't want us

6253.56 --> 6259.599
to have sex out of

6256.119 --> 6262.598999999999
wedlock because it would just ruin

6259.599 --> 6262.599
things

6267.679 --> 6270.84
yeah it's purely

6270.96 --> 6273.96
logical

6274.88 --> 6279.04
right it's causing effect like oh well

6277.719 --> 6281.44
you're going to do it well guess what's

6279.04 --> 6282.8
going to happen bad things are probably

6281.44 --> 6284.28
going to happen you're going to have to

6282.8 --> 6287.08
have like all this whole thing that

6284.28 --> 6289.5599999999995
you're now have to account for and try

6287.08 --> 6292.679
to keep

6289.56 --> 6297.4800000000005
stable try to hold off God's

6292.679 --> 6297.4800000000005
punishment that's how that is

6310.32 --> 6314.119
yeah

6311.92 --> 6316.679
right anyway this has been a very

6314.119 --> 6316.679
Dynamic

6319.48 --> 6322.48
show

6325.76 --> 6329.719
what the hell didn't we talk about in

6327.56 --> 6329.719
this

6333.08 --> 6337.5599999999995
show god let's try to summarize

6339.23 --> 6342.33
[Music]

6346.6 --> 6352.4800000000005
[Music]

6349.48 --> 6352.48
this

6373.74 --> 6376.83
[Music]

6384.76 --> 6391.1990000000005
okay let's see if this Super Bowl the

6387.92 --> 6396.719
dash huc huc

6391.199 --> 6396.719
hallucinogens seafood and God's laws and

6399.32 --> 6402.92
why did I miss

6409.4 --> 6412.4
anything

6414.719 --> 6419.159
did anybody mention

6416.84 --> 6422.639
raie

6419.159 --> 6425.48
yeah yeah steamy traveler we've heard of

6422.639 --> 6427.76
that it's kind of known that she's doing

6425.48 --> 6429.799999999999
that whatever it people don't really get

6427.76 --> 6432.679
like it was talked about yesterday in

6429.8 --> 6432.679
the after after

6433.88 --> 6439.32
show she will be back yeah well maybe

6436.639 --> 6442.32
nobody really cares

6439.32 --> 6442.32
now

6446.88 --> 6454.679
maybe we don't really care about her

6450.56 --> 6454.679
incoherent positions too

6459.36 --> 6465.96
much I mean she's like a

6462.199 --> 6468.199
bird she's not coming off the fence

6465.96 --> 6469.84
she'll just fly off she's not coming off

6468.199 --> 6471.919999999999
the fence she is a bird she's going to

6469.84 --> 6473.4800000000005
sit on that fence she is's not coming

6471.92 --> 6477.4800000000005
come down from the

6473.48 --> 6477.48
fence that's how I kind of see

6489.199 --> 6494.638999999999
it right anyway I'm going to take a two

6491.28 --> 6494.639
in break I'll be right

6499.239 --> 6502.239
back

6559.119 --> 6562.119
for

6589.119 --> 6592.119
e

6597.92 --> 6600.36
and I'm

6602.45 --> 6605.6089999999995
[Music]

6616.55 --> 6622.04
[Music]

6619.04 --> 6622.04
back

6636.78 --> 6643.219999999999
[Music]

6649.04 --> 6652.04
what

6652.599 --> 6659.599
Mikey what are you talking about love

6656.079 --> 6659.599
fruit who's this

6668.0 --> 6675.96
Mikey written most sh most Harvest is

6672.159 --> 6675.96
nearly outlow to Rivers yeah

6678.96 --> 6684.119
yeah yeah that's well I overlooked

6685.04 --> 6692.079
that diver de na vet but yeah the shell

6689.159 --> 6695.5199999999995
fish fish was near the the outflow of

6692.079 --> 6698.88
the river sewage and not just sewage

6695.52 --> 6701.4400000000005
also mining

6698.88 --> 6706.8
yeah mining

6701.44 --> 6710.678999999999
waste so any place that had like a gold

6706.8 --> 6712.1990000000005
mine well in those days they would

6710.679 --> 6715.96
sometimes use

6712.199 --> 6718.919999999999
mercury to get the gold ore

6715.96 --> 6721.199
out and yeah what you think they had

6718.92 --> 6723.1990000000005
environmental regulations no they

6721.199 --> 6726.199
literally just dump that [ __ ] in the

6723.199 --> 6727.919999999999
water after they're done with it and

6726.199 --> 6732.04
they got the gold

6727.92 --> 6733.76
out or well there would be just

6732.04 --> 6738.0
plenty

6733.76 --> 6739.4800000000005
pollution and yeah well Mercury is

6738.0 --> 6741.76
that's going to like flow out in the

6739.48 --> 6744.598999999999
river it's going to be in the sewage

6741.76 --> 6746.8
it's going to be on the food and those

6744.599 --> 6749.0
shellfish are going to eat that and then

6746.8 --> 6752.84
have that in

6749.0 --> 6754.88
them doesn't come out it's

6752.84 --> 6756.400000000001
bioaccumulative right so I think that

6754.88 --> 6760.4400000000005
that was

6756.4 --> 6765.48
also part of it not just

6760.44 --> 6767.5199999999995
sewage but also like actual toxin like

6765.48 --> 6771.598999999999
Mercury

6767.52 --> 6773.4800000000005
mining pollution right because yeah they

6771.599 --> 6775.8
needed

6773.48 --> 6780.44
water in the mining

6775.8 --> 6780.4400000000005
process often to clean things out

6785.639 --> 6790.1990000000005
whatever Mercury is still used for gold

6787.84 --> 6793.28
EXT yes but now they have strict

6790.199 --> 6795.678999999999
environmental policies with using it low

6793.28 --> 6798.719
fruit they don't just dump it in the

6795.679 --> 6801.76
water they just put it in your vaccines

6798.719 --> 6801.76
now yeah

6807.679 --> 6813.4800000000005
yeah I

6810.199 --> 6817.759999999999
mean it's just like the crazy story with

6813.48 --> 6819.44
those certain types of uh what is it

6817.76 --> 6822.1990000000005
energy saving

6819.44 --> 6824.638999999999
lamps remember those smart lamps or so

6822.199 --> 6828.239
what the hell are they called they had

6824.639 --> 6831.079
mercury in it if you dropped that if you

6828.239 --> 6833.36
broke that lamp on the ground

6831.079 --> 6835.759999999999
and you literally like have to call like

6833.36 --> 6838.4
Environmental Protection [ __ ] I'm not

6835.76 --> 6840.1990000000005
even joking like that's official because

6838.4 --> 6845.199
it's so

6840.199 --> 6849.119
toxic but if it's just put in a

6845.199 --> 6850.678999999999
syringe for medical reasons that's

6849.119 --> 6853.32
perfectly fine you could just have that

6850.679 --> 6857.28
injected into you then it's then they

6853.32 --> 6859.759999999999
it's okay if you drop a lamp that has

6857.28 --> 6861.159
similar substance in it on the ground

6859.76 --> 6864.719
you have

6861.159 --> 6867.719
like people in Suits come to try and

6864.719 --> 6870.119
like try to clean it up I'm not even

6867.719 --> 6871.92
joking that's real that used to be I

6870.119 --> 6874.04
don't think they do it

6871.92 --> 6876.92
anymore those types of lamps that

6874.04 --> 6881.4
they've moved on to like the lead lights

6876.92 --> 6881.4
and all that which are also very

6888.679 --> 6891.679
efficient

6895.199 --> 6898.799999999999
the

6896.28 --> 6901.5199999999995
[ __ ] yeah that's definitely a troll and

6898.8 --> 6901.52
he stole my

6904.239 --> 6907.5599999999995
icon what the

6914.639 --> 6921.599
[ __ ] no wait this is

6917.28 --> 6921.599
subscription today joined

6923.719 --> 6929.84
okay but uh

6927.159 --> 6931.799999999999
whatever is this a closed Group Well if

6929.84 --> 6935.8
it's a closed group then I wouldn't be

6931.8 --> 6939.320000000001
able to read what you're talking

6935.8 --> 6942.360000000001
about if it was a Clos group why why why

6939.32 --> 6942.36
would I have a public

6946.76 --> 6952.079000000001
chat illegal gold miners don't care

6955.92 --> 6961.76
yeah I thought Flat Earth is were

6958.239 --> 6964.598999999999
welcome yeah we are we're also highly

6961.76 --> 6966.8
suspicious because we get zered by

6964.599 --> 6970.4800000000005
people

6966.8 --> 6974.119000000001
that that are just there to try to bully

6970.48 --> 6975.959999999999
us because we believe in Flat Earth so

6974.119 --> 6977.88
we're kind of used to that especially

6975.96 --> 6980.639
with newcomers that have accounts that

6977.88 --> 6983.639
are literally made today that's you

6980.639 --> 6983.639

fine we're just very

7004.4 --> 7009.28
suspicious people have literally said oh

7009.28 --> 7014.48
people people and they were just trying

7012.199 --> 7018.4
to play friendly and

7014.48 --> 7021.598999999999

7237.56 --> 7243.159000000001
cool we would love yeah never I'm

7241.0 --> 7246.88
eclectic I don't join

7243.159 --> 7251.119
anything I'll get to know

7246.88 --> 7251.119
you I'll share my wisdom

7252.48 --> 7258.718999999999
but I don't join

7254.639 --> 7262.96
anything that people have tried a

7258.719 --> 7265.44
lot this it's just that I just

7262.96 --> 7268.159
fundamentally disagree with the

7265.44 --> 7269.5199999999995
doctrines like entirely and I don't

7268.159 --> 7272.839999999999
think that it's

7269.52 --> 7276.159000000001
actually truthful I think that the Bible

7272.84 --> 7278.639
was manipulated

7276.159 --> 7280.96
irreversibly at a very early stage and

7278.639 --> 7284.1990000000005
then what we get is the

7280.96 --> 7287.2390000000005
Catholic Bible

7284.199 --> 7289.5199999999995
worldwide it's not the real one it's

7287.239 --> 7289.5199999999995
been

7291.28 --> 7297.5199999999995
Rewritten I don't even think it takes

7293.679 --> 7297.52
place in Palestine at

7308.04 --> 7311.5199999999995
all

7309.56 --> 7315.1990000000005
don't want to interrupt the show just

7311.52 --> 7315.1990000000005
yeah what but dude why

7321.4 --> 7325.638999999999
not everything remember everything is an

7324.36 --> 7328.32
archetype

7325.639 --> 7331.079
arons well not everything is but you

7328.32 --> 7333.719
could definitely rearrange information

7331.079 --> 7336.719
in that sense is very helpful and it

7333.719 --> 7339.04
will lead to frequency

7336.719 --> 7341.4800000000005
thinking and that's something that I

7339.04 --> 7341.48
definitely

7342.28 --> 7345.28
do

7345.4 --> 7352.36
archangels yeah that's so cute I I use

7350.52 --> 7355.96
what I

7352.36 --> 7359.679
use I'm very focused on Archangel

7355.96 --> 7362.32
Michael very is hyper prominent you

7359.679 --> 7363.84
might have noticed like in a lot of

7362.32 --> 7366.5599999999995
different religions including

7363.84 --> 7369.88
non-Christian

7366.56 --> 7373.04
ones hyper focused on that that

7369.88 --> 7375.4800000000005
literally use him in my healing in my

7373.04 --> 7375.48
healing

7381.04 --> 7389.48
techniques but yeah my lore is at the

7385.04 --> 7389.48
rout is really mostly rudol Steiner

7397.88 --> 7402.679
based

7400.8 --> 7407.84
and I'm still in the middle of

7402.679 --> 7410.4
exploring like or trying to put together

7407.84 --> 7412.360000000001
like an ancient detective of a detective

7410.4 --> 7414.598999999999
of ancient times try to put together

7412.36 --> 7417.4
like what Christ what that really was

7414.599 --> 7418.56
what really happened my conclusion thus

7417.4 --> 7421.5199999999995
far is

7418.56 --> 7424.119000000001
that Jesus Christ was potentially two

7421.52 --> 7427.0
people that were like a

7424.119 --> 7429.839999999999
team a

7427.0 --> 7432.52
nobleman redheaded Noble

7429.84 --> 7434.679
woman and a

7432.52 --> 7437.040000000001
Healer they probably they could have

7434.679 --> 7439.4400000000005
been brothers or they're very looking

7437.04 --> 7442.48
alike they might have been later

7439.44 --> 7444.239
referenced as one person but the noble

7442.48 --> 7447.919999999999
one would be the the one that did all

7444.239 --> 7453.32
the talks and the Healer guy did the

7447.92 --> 7456.04
Miracles and the noble speaker Jesus was

7453.32 --> 7459.799999999999
brilliant absolutely bril and likely a

7456.04 --> 7462.84
descendant of Cleopatra from that family

7459.8 --> 7465.599
line uh most of the events likely took

7462.84 --> 7469.32
place in southern

7465.599 --> 7471.639
France and then very likely the nobleman

7469.32 --> 7474.48
after the crucifixion of the

7471.639 --> 7476.400000000001
Healer if any of that literally happened

7474.48 --> 7478.36
but it probably only could have happened

7476.4 --> 7481.28
in France because they had

7478.36 --> 7486.159
wood to do that sort of

7481.28 --> 7489.8
thing well in that time even

7486.159 --> 7491.92
Palestine they don't just like have wood

7489.8 --> 7494.52
a

7491.92 --> 7497.32
plenty they would never just do that

7494.52 --> 7499.0
like it's it's ridiculous the entire

7497.32 --> 7500.799999999999
scenario when you think about the

7499.0 --> 7504.159
logistics and all

7500.8 --> 7506.159000000001
that so southern France and then after

7504.159 --> 7509.879999999999
the

7506.159 --> 7513.839999999999
crucifixtion or maybe even before that

7509.88 --> 7517.28
happened the nobleman Jesus went to

7513.84 --> 7520.360000000001
India and then probably met up with

7517.28 --> 7521.44
Buddha or his High priests or however

7520.36 --> 7524.759999999999
that

7521.44 --> 7528.839999999999
was and there was even a temple

7524.76 --> 7530.52
built there in India for that Jesus

7528.84 --> 7532.84
right and that's what I think is really

7530.52 --> 7536.639
happened also I think that it all

7532.84 --> 7541.679
happened much earlier like uh what is it

7536.639 --> 7541.679
1100 years ago something like that not

7545.239 --> 7550.839999999999
2,000 and there's whole been a whole

7547.639 --> 7552.96
bunch of his historical engineering a

7550.84 --> 7555.76
thousand years have been artificially

7552.96 --> 7559.88
inserted in our

7555.76 --> 7562.52
history pulling that actual time event

7559.88 --> 7565.52
apart and then filling

7562.52 --> 7567.0
it rearranged with those things that

7565.52 --> 7570.119000000001
pretty much happen around the same

7567.0 --> 7572.84
moment filling it spreading it around so

7570.119 --> 7575.28
there's like this virtual thousand years

7572.84 --> 7577.04
in which history is also put in but it's

7575.28 --> 7578.679
like very Loosely connected doesn't

7577.04 --> 7581.079
really make too much sense when you all

7578.679 --> 7582.719
start to cross reference it but it will

7581.079 --> 7584.799999999999
make a lot more sense when you realize

7582.719 --> 7588.199
that is actually all roughly at the same

7584.8 --> 7591.639
time that Jesus Christ was pretty much

7588.199 --> 7595.558999999999
peing in popularity in medieval times

7591.639 --> 7595.559
because that's when he

7595.96 --> 7601.88
came and not a thousand year way before

7599.679 --> 7603.4800000000005
medieval no that's literally he came

7601.88 --> 7606.4400000000005
during medieval

7603.48 --> 7609.638999999999
times and that's why he was like highly

7606.44 --> 7612.4
revered and why like all his art his

7609.639 --> 7614.599
artifacts like yeah because he literally

7612.4 --> 7616.598999999999
was right there he had just done those

7614.599 --> 7618.84
Miracles and everybody was like oh

7616.599 --> 7622.04
there's a great God

7618.84 --> 7623.400000000001
man oh we need to get his blood we need

7622.04 --> 7625.88
to get his bones we need to get his

7623.4 --> 7627.799999999999
artifacts and his Spear and and the cup

7625.88 --> 7630.76
and they were all obsessed because it

7627.8 --> 7630.76
had just

7631.48 --> 7636.5199999999995
happened what you think that a thousand

7634.4 --> 7638.759999999999
years before that oh he just did that

7636.52 --> 7641.84
and all those things happened and they

7638.76 --> 7647.96
just solemly oh let's just get back to

7641.84 --> 7647.96
life let's just deal with the no dude

7650.679 --> 7656.8
nonsense if Jesus had actually come and

7654.36 --> 7659.88
done his things and his miracles in that

7656.8 --> 7662.8
time there would have been a massive

7659.88 --> 7665.1990000000005
explosion of culture and references and

7662.8 --> 7669.599
just like that would have literally

7665.199 --> 7671.678999999999
transformed everything out there

7669.599 --> 7674.1990000000005
and it

7671.679 --> 7675.719
didn't all that popularity all came

7674.199 --> 7678.558999999999
during Medieval

7675.719 --> 7682.04
Times why the hell would they suddenly

7678.559 --> 7685.88
become so obsessed and popular with the

7682.04 --> 7688.96
A Thousand Years Later makes no sense

7685.88 --> 7690.4400000000005
why would people even like believe in

7688.96 --> 7695.079
that

7690.44 --> 7695.079
[ __ ] if it was like a thousand years

7695.92 --> 7703.8
before no it's it's fresh Miracles fresh

7699.96 --> 7707.119
events the meeting like my grandpa met

7703.8 --> 7709.92
Jesus Christ he didn't talk like yeah

7707.119 --> 7711.799999999999
that's something that really creates a

7709.92 --> 7714.76
popularity and

7711.8 --> 7717.119000000001
influence when it just

7714.76 --> 7720.52
happened that's how I see

7717.119 --> 7724.4
it very different from how the Bible is

7720.52 --> 7727.639
described although I do actually trust

7724.4 --> 7729.96
to a degree trust that the words are

7727.639 --> 7732.119
actually his even though the events are

7729.96 --> 7734.52
completely rearranged the story is

7732.119 --> 7737.5199999999995
Rewritten but I think that Jesus words

7734.52 --> 7737.52
are the original

7750.88 --> 7756.04
words hey that one guy by the way good

7753.76 --> 7756.04
to see

7757.32 --> 7760.32
you

7760.76 --> 7766.320000000001
seat I don't exactly know the seat I am

7764.719 --> 7769.4
literally

7766.32 --> 7772.28
describing the substance of how I see it

7769.4 --> 7775.239
I don't have like specific references

7772.28 --> 7777.48
and I've barely personally read any of

7775.239 --> 7777.48
these

7777.92 --> 7784.119
things I'm not concerned with absorbing

7781.079 --> 7787.199
all that material I'm concerned with

7784.119 --> 7787.199
understanding what it

7787.32 --> 7793.719
is and what which Monumental things are

7792.44 --> 7798.04
taken for

7793.719 --> 7798.04
granted that are completely

7799.92 --> 7803.88
faked I think the Catholic church is

7802.159 --> 7807.079
full of

7803.88 --> 7810.079
that they really made it their business

7807.079 --> 7813.44
to rewrite history in a massive

7810.079 --> 7815.44
way and they used the Jesuits to do that

7813.44 --> 7820.239
and to guarantee it by literally sending

7815.44 --> 7820.239
them out everywhere and making them

7820.44 --> 7826.598999999999
Force other religious leaders to

7823.36 --> 7828.92
alter their history or their beliefs to

7826.599 --> 7832.1990000000005
make it to make it universally

7828.92 --> 7835.159
compatible with the new history system

7832.199 --> 7836.28
that the Catholic Church organized for

7835.159 --> 7840.759999999999
the

7836.28 --> 7843.199
world they did that as they also created

7840.76 --> 7844.119000000001
the design for the globe cosmology that

7843.199 --> 7847.919999999999
would

7844.119 --> 7849.0
become the societal belief the societal

7847.92 --> 7853.4
Rel

7849.0 --> 7856.599
religion to do to actually finally be

7853.4 --> 7858.92
able to do away with Jesus

7856.599 --> 7861.76
Christ which would have been so

7858.92 --> 7862.52
convoluted already over the ages over

7861.76 --> 7865.76
the

7862.52 --> 7870.0
centuries by ridiculous interpretations

7865.76 --> 7873.2390000000005
and the glor the literal ification of of

7870.0 --> 7877.159
godhood in Jesus Christ and all that

7873.239 --> 7878.678999999999
crazy self-contradicting illogical stuff

7877.159 --> 7881.92
that's

7878.679 --> 7884.719
came from priests Catholics started

7881.92 --> 7887.1990000000005
doing that and every [ __ ] religion in

7884.719 --> 7889.04
the world adapted to them oh we're

7887.199 --> 7890.719
protesting you oh we're Protestants

7889.04 --> 7892.96
we're protesting you we're going to do

7890.719 --> 7896.559
it differently except you're doing to do

7892.96 --> 7900.36
it exactly the same

7896.559 --> 7902.92
exactly the same except for a few

7900.36 --> 7906.92
political differences on how to live

7902.92 --> 7910.559
your life yes yes it's exactly the same

7906.92 --> 7913.32
exact copy of the complete corruption

7910.559 --> 7916.4800000000005
and rewriting of history and the

7913.32 --> 7920.4
original teachings of Christ

7916.48 --> 7922.919999999999
yeah there is no real Christianity it's

7920.4 --> 7925.119
all based on the corrupted version all

7922.92 --> 7925.119
of

7925.36 --> 7931.5199999999995
it all forms of Christianity out there

7928.719 --> 7935.079
are all corrupted because they're all

7931.52 --> 7938.320000000001
freaking based on the same same story

7935.079 --> 7939.639
system every single time and that story

7938.32 --> 7941.799999999999
is

7939.639 --> 7943.8
constructed it's like it's been written

7941.8 --> 7946.320000000001
by Shakespeare or

7943.8 --> 7949.76
something it's

7946.32 --> 7952.96
not it's not the original it's not the

7949.76 --> 7954.1990000000005
thing that the actual Jesus Christ wrote

7952.96 --> 7957.199
down and

7954.199 --> 7960.0
organized for the new religion it's not

7957.199 --> 7964.079
that that's not this Bible the Bible we

7960.0 --> 7968.079
know isn't that yeah and and Paul in

7964.079 --> 7970.48
there Saul become Paul oh he really

7968.079 --> 7972.96
really knew how to do it oh he changed

7970.48 --> 7976.44
it oh because oh he saw it in the vision

7972.96 --> 7979.88
Jesus came after he had literally been

7976.44 --> 7983.598999999999
sent out by Rome to literally

7979.88 --> 7986.84
assassinate the original

7983.599 --> 7991.0
Christians oh yeah but he WR oh he saw

7986.84 --> 7994.88
Jesus after he murdered his religion his

7991.0 --> 7998.04
priests like to erase them but then he

7994.88 --> 8000.679
saw Jesus oh now I'm going to replace it

7998.04 --> 8003.639
and all there's a certain few things I

8000.679 --> 8006.639
know better I know better than Jesus Oh

8003.639 --> 8010.4400000000005
and Jesus is literally God now but I saw

8006.639 --> 8012.599
him in a vision and I know better oh yes

8010.44 --> 8015.719
yes yes and that's the entire [ __ ]

8012.599 --> 8017.079
religion now yeah that's that's

8015.719 --> 8020.559
Christianity

8017.079 --> 8026.96
now it's a cluster screw that people

8020.559 --> 8029.96
still are not capable of dealing with at

8026.96 --> 8029.96
all

8030.599 --> 8035.1990000000005
a lot of people just see it when they

8033.0 --> 8037.239
really figure this out they're just like

8035.199 --> 8038.719
[ __ ] it oh I'm just going to be atheist

8037.239 --> 8040.44
I'm just going to have a private God

8038.719 --> 8042.159
belief and I'm not going to listen to

8040.44 --> 8045.919999999999
anything

8042.159 --> 8045.92
anymore and I don't blame

8052.8 --> 8058.3
him real early sci-fi yeah Catholics

8056.8 --> 8061.0
it's theocracy

8058.3 --> 8063.88
[Music]

8061.0 --> 8067.0
the rewriting of

8063.88 --> 8068.92
History they were masters of rewriting

8067.0 --> 8073.119
of

8068.92 --> 8076.679
History they they normalized that form

8073.119 --> 8081.36
of government mind

8076.679 --> 8085.1990000000005
control they mastered rewriting

8081.36 --> 8087.5199999999995
history for mind control like might

8085.199 --> 8089.0
sound familiar there's a very specific

8087.52 --> 8093.96
model type

8089.0 --> 8095.96
of state state craft that does that

8093.96 --> 8098.559
called

8095.96 --> 8103.04
communism oh I guess where that came

8098.559 --> 8106.84
from oh oh oh yes yes the same thing

8103.04 --> 8109.88
right that's why Catholic Church first

8106.84 --> 8111.719
gave us a fake Christianity rewriting to

8109.88 --> 8113.400000000001
ridicule him and to make himself

8111.719 --> 8115.119
contradicting so that all the Christians

8113.4 --> 8117.48
would believe in self-contradicting

8115.119 --> 8119.239
nonsense delivering them to Satan in

8117.48 --> 8123.598999999999
their

8119.239 --> 8126.5199999999995
foolishness then they created the globe

8123.599 --> 8129.84
cosmology so that God could be denied

8126.52 --> 8131.360000000001
entirely and people further disoriented

8129.84 --> 8136.1990000000005
about

8131.36 --> 8136.199
reality and then they created

8137.28 --> 8141.079
communism to

8139.44 --> 8144.839999999999
rewrite

8141.079 --> 8147.558999999999
history like on a more official

8144.84 --> 8150.52
capacity and then finally we're topping

8147.559 --> 8154.4800000000005
it up with transhumanism where literally

8150.52 --> 8156.639
like the very Spirit of a being is

8154.48 --> 8159.5199999999995
systematically being

8156.639 --> 8163.76
denied and people are just treated like

8159.52 --> 8167.4800000000005
robots which are slaves that's literally

8163.76 --> 8171.0
origin of the word so it's all just just

8167.48 --> 8173.04
human robot machines and oh yeah that's

8171.0 --> 8174.84
transhumanism yeah that's the final

8173.04 --> 8177.559
Branch that's where

8174.84 --> 8181.559
literally the very spirit and soul is

8177.559 --> 8186.400000000001
just just completely denied and avoided

8181.559 --> 8190.360000000001
and derailed and why all normal normal

8186.4 --> 8192.8
human Godly activity and with Godly I

8190.36 --> 8194.479
mean just things that God rewards things

8192.8 --> 8197.119999999999
that are naturally rewarding where they

8194.479 --> 8201.0
are all denied and turned inside out and

8197.12 --> 8203.0
that is the real final Horsemen of the

8201.0 --> 8205.28
Apocalypse right so those are the Four

8203.0 --> 8206.319
Horsemen of the Apocalypse in my view in

8205.28 --> 8209.880000000001
my

8206.319 --> 8213.039999999999
system first the Antichrist to replace

8209.88 --> 8216.479
Christ it replaces religion then the

8213.04 --> 8217.76
globe model that reverses the entire

8216.479 --> 8221.639
universe

8217.76 --> 8224.16
further moving away from God and

8221.639 --> 8227.88
creation and then the third one

8224.16 --> 8230.2
communism to to normalize rewriting

8227.88 --> 8233.039999999999
history rewriting

8230.2 --> 8235.2
reality for a nation to become

8233.04 --> 8239.599
completely Godless and Machin likee and

8235.2 --> 8239.599
then finally transhumanism

8239.8 --> 8245.8
to to like

8242.399 --> 8248.599
permanently disconnect humans from Godly

8245.8 --> 8251.319
Consciousness and turn them

8248.599 --> 8254.12
into Flesh and Blood

8251.319 --> 8258.76
machines without a soul or

8254.12 --> 8258.76
Spirit just robotically

8259.479 --> 8263.438999999998
control and that's how I see

8266.599 --> 8269.599
that

8279.84 --> 8286.399
lambus to established all of the ritual

8282.76 --> 8286.399
that the Catholics later adopted

8286.679 --> 8289.679
right

8296.519 --> 8299.519
interesting

8300.04 --> 8305.76
right but I hope

8301.319 --> 8309.639
that you're now properly informed ritual

8305.76 --> 8309.639000000001
magic what how I see

8318.28 --> 8325.12
it also yeah besides that specific

8322.519 --> 8329.12
historical ex uh

8325.12 --> 8330.76
explanation how I see it I also

8329.12 --> 8334.12
approach

8330.76 --> 8336.800000000001
God and all that in a much more esoteric

8334.12 --> 8341.479000000001
way where I literally focus on the

8336.8 --> 8343.518999999998
frequency so I I say God is truth and

8341.479 --> 8346.399
Satan is

8343.519 --> 8347.880000000001
lies that the essence that surround

8346.399 --> 8350.76
those

8347.88 --> 8354.24
actions and those focuses with our

8350.76 --> 8356.12
Consciousness is literally like

8354.24 --> 8359.8
directly

8356.12 --> 8361.439
connected it's like you can summon God

8359.8 --> 8364.599
his Spirit not

8361.439 --> 8366.800000000001
physically through the truth and all

8364.599 --> 8368.92
those rules of that frequency applies

8366.8 --> 8373.0
through the truth and all those from

8368.92 --> 8376.92
Satan and lies respond in kind it's like

8373.0 --> 8380.0
every time people communicate there is

8376.92 --> 8382.399
things esoterically happening between

8380.0 --> 8385.359
God and the

8382.399 --> 8390.84
devil through the Alchemy of Truth and

8385.359 --> 8390.84
lies and how they work it's another

8394.439 --> 8398.880000000001
expression there's certain powers that

8396.72 --> 8401.64
are available when you are

8398.88 --> 8404.08
fanatically truthful in your

8401.64 --> 8405.68
Consciousness and there's

8404.08 --> 8408.039999999999
certain

8405.68 --> 8411.24
consequences that are very palpably

8408.04 --> 8413.76
going to happen to you in your life when

8411.24 --> 8419.359
you

8413.76 --> 8419.359
accept being a liar for yourself

8427.16 --> 8434.0
like a liar will never that like decide

8431.8 --> 8437.16
their Li will never be truly connected

8434.0 --> 8442.08
to God they will have a percentage of

8437.16 --> 8444.2
their conscious spent to try to cover up

8442.08 --> 8446.319
their lies to try to deceive and

8444.2 --> 8448.319000000001
dissuade other peoples from figuring

8446.319 --> 8450.88
them out

8448.319 --> 8450.88
it's all

8454.439 --> 8460.960000000001
satan right ritual magic yeah so that's

8457.399 --> 8462.68
I'm very esoteric in that sense I'm

8460.96 --> 8464.438999999998
esoteric

8462.68 --> 8466.56
oriented

8464.439 --> 8469.439
eclectic

8466.56 --> 8472.279999999999
Christian or I'd like to say rather

8469.439 --> 8474.24
follower of the path of Christ cuz I'm

8472.28 --> 8477.880000000001
not technically a Christian because

8474.24 --> 8481.68
Christian great Mark is literally the

8477.88 --> 8483.8
Catholic self-contradicting nonsense

8481.68 --> 8485.6
system where you have to believe in

8483.8 --> 8488.84
certain things or you're

8485.6 --> 8491.319
suddenly you're barred out of the club

8488.84 --> 8493.880000000001
of a conjured

8491.319 --> 8498.519999999999
afterlife that by the way Jesus Christ

8493.88 --> 8502.119999999999
never even said that it work that

8498.52 --> 8503.640000000001
way and also very conveniently the

8502.12 --> 8506.0
Catholic Church left out the book of

8503.64 --> 8508.72
Thomas in which Jesus Christ mentioned

8506.0 --> 8512.52
reincarnation yeah that that definitely

8508.72 --> 8515.72
doesn't fit the uh the Catholic system

8512.52 --> 8519.319000000001
that is the foundation for Christianity

8515.72 --> 8519.319
thinking right yeah

8522.88 --> 8527.56
yeah

8524.479 --> 8532.199999999999
so that's how I approach it I am

8527.56 --> 8536.399
merciless about the logic logic

8532.2 --> 8538.359
is is what tells you if it's not logical

8536.399 --> 8541.399
if it's a par

8538.359 --> 8541.399000000001
then it's sat

8541.72 --> 8548.08
satanic it's real or it's not real if

8545.04 --> 8549.880000000001
it's not real it's of Satan it's a

8548.08 --> 8554.0
distraction it's an illusion it's not

8549.88 --> 8557.64
real it's a lie if it's true then it is

8554.0 --> 8557.64
of god and it is

8563.16 --> 8569.16
eternal how does anyone know what Jesus

8566.04 --> 8569.160000000002
did or did not say

8569.68 --> 8575.6
by literally listening to the

8572.319 --> 8578.119999999999
words and understand the fractal

8575.6 --> 8580.56
implications it's like the words are so

8578.12 --> 8582.960000000001
good that even when appli to this

8580.56 --> 8584.92
fictional reconstructed story they are

8582.96 --> 8586.8
still

8584.92 --> 8590.6
magnificent that's how you know the

8586.8 --> 8594.16
words were transplanted into this

8590.6 --> 8596.08
story and like even with the fake Story

8594.16 --> 8597.6
the words are

8596.08 --> 8600.12
magnificent

8597.6 --> 8601.76
make you understand things that are even

8600.12 --> 8605.279
separated from the

8601.76 --> 8607.880000000001
story you see and that's how you know

8605.279 --> 8612.800000000001
you know it through the power that are

8607.88 --> 8612.8
right there in the words that's how you

8613.52 --> 8621.52
know cu the power of Christ is literally

8617.279 --> 8621.52
there in the words to for you to

8622.0 --> 8626.92
realize CU on the surface you might say

8624.56 --> 8629.64
oh this and that and and then you might

8626.92 --> 8631.0
think think yeah but who what if I look

8629.64 --> 8634.16
at at a bigger

8631.0 --> 8637.8
perspective or strategic perspective you

8634.16 --> 8640.92
give it a look from every angle and then

8637.8 --> 8644.199999999999
you see then when you looked at it from

8640.92 --> 8646.76
every angle including a hostile one

8644.2 --> 8648.319000000001
potentially an unbeliever or somebody

8646.76 --> 8650.479
that would hate him look at it from

8648.319 --> 8655.08
every angle and then you'll see you'll

8650.479 --> 8658.72
see that it accounts for anything any

8655.08 --> 8661.12
perspective it is UN

8658.72 --> 8665.16
IAL his words

8661.12 --> 8667.399000000001
are high fractal implication every time

8665.16 --> 8669.84
it's like you can transplant that

8667.399 --> 8673.64
character and what he says and put it on

8669.84 --> 8673.64
another story and it'll still

8673.68 --> 8680.720000000001
work

8676.2 --> 8680.720000000001
because his teachings are

8685.96 --> 8688.96
Universal

8689.2 --> 8696.16
but if God is all powerful how can he be

8692.0 --> 8698.56
confounded by Satan he can't but God

8696.16 --> 8700.279
created the game and it's up to people

8698.56 --> 8703.76
yeah it's the people that actually have

8700.279 --> 8706.04
the power and the people can give God

8703.76 --> 8709.52
the power or they can give Satan the

8706.04 --> 8713.68
power within the realm Satan cannot

8709.52 --> 8715.880000000001
overcome God but he can convince people

8713.68 --> 8718.880000000001
to hide God from

8715.88 --> 8718.88
themselves

8727.29 --> 8730.609
[Music]

8731.08 --> 8736.76
Jesus said to love your enemies I don't

8733.08 --> 8739.6
know anyone that follows that well I do

8736.76 --> 8739.6
I I do my

8743.12 --> 8748.92
best what if what if you just saw that

8746.279 --> 8752.960000000001
differently in instead of love how about

8748.92 --> 8757.12
care for your enemies how about seeing

8752.96 --> 8758.039999999999
them as they are mistakenly seeing me as

8757.12 --> 8760.84
their

8758.04 --> 8762.279
enemy and I will try to help them

8760.84 --> 8764.92
correct that

8762.279 --> 8766.399000000001
mistake so that they realize that they

8764.92 --> 8769.68
actually are my

8766.399 --> 8772.72
friends that's how I see

8769.68 --> 8774.479000000001
that that's how I see love your enemies

8772.72 --> 8778.8
you don't just love your enemies

8774.479 --> 8778.8
unconditionally and then just

8779.08 --> 8786.12
become subjugated by that no no no you

8782.64 --> 8787.92
just see them as not as somebody that's

8786.12 --> 8790.319000000001
making a mistake as somebody that

8787.92 --> 8793.399
actually wants to be your

8790.319 --> 8796.68
friend like f good reason not out of

8793.399 --> 8797.76
domination or out of fear no because

8796.68 --> 8800.880000000001
they

8797.76 --> 8803.6
actually can be made to realize that

8800.88 --> 8803.599999999999
they're not your

8805.8 --> 8808.8
enemy

8811.0 --> 8816.56
Satan and eternal punishment seem like a

8813.04 --> 8816.560000000001
scare tactic to me yeah it

8820.16 --> 8825.64
is I'm pretty damn sure that it's mostly

8823.12 --> 8828.560000000001
Satan that haunts Us in this world in

8825.64 --> 8833.08
our Waking Life That's where Satan hunts

8828.56 --> 8835.479
us haunts us and that will definitely

8833.08 --> 8837.479
have implications for the afterlife by

8835.479 --> 8841.438999999998
the way

8837.479 --> 8844.119999999999
but this this crazy notion that there's

8841.439 --> 8846.08
like Oh either you end up in heaven or

8844.12 --> 8848.399000000001
you end up in hell and the only way you

8846.08 --> 8849.92
end up in heaven is if you chant this

8848.399 --> 8853.319
[ __ ] nonsense and then whatever

8849.92 --> 8857.359
you've done is Forgiven

8853.319 --> 8860.56
yeah I mean I cannot think of a more

8857.359 --> 8861.399000000001
egregious spiritual based Ponzi scheme

8860.56 --> 8864.039999999999
than

8861.399 --> 8868.68
that it's just a

8864.04 --> 8868.68
scheme it's really pathetic

8871.399 --> 8876.479
but yeah Satan definitely tests us

8873.88 --> 8879.278999999999
haunts us potentially if we fail those

8876.479 --> 8881.599999999999
tests within our Waking

8879.279 --> 8884.12
Life

8881.6 --> 8886.12
esoterically and in the Dark World

8884.12 --> 8888.68
potentially literally when we're

8886.12 --> 8891.6
actually seduced then in our dreams the

8888.68 --> 8895.64
Devil May literally personify themselves

8891.6 --> 8898.24
I have personally literally experienced

8895.64 --> 8900.64
that

8898.24 --> 8903.878999999999
not pleasant by the

8900.64 --> 8903.878999999999
[Music]

8905.64 --> 8910.64
way right don't believe you end up in

8908.16 --> 8914.84
hell yeah and I I

8910.64 --> 8917.399
despise that notion if you don't believe

8914.84 --> 8920.359
yeah you know who else uses those

8917.399 --> 8920.358999999999
tactics

8921.16 --> 8927.439
Hollywood oh dream you just have to

8923.72 --> 8930.278999999999
dream oh just believe yeah [ __ ] you you

8927.439 --> 8933.279
how about let's not use fairy tale

8930.279 --> 8934.6
tactics and how about we just figure out

8933.279 --> 8937.399000000001
what has to

8934.6 --> 8938.6
be yeah it's a literally a more

8937.399 --> 8941.92
scientific

8938.6 --> 8943.56
approach we figure out what has to be

8941.92 --> 8947.479
through

8943.56 --> 8950.72
logic and empirical

8947.479 --> 8954.16
tests and

8950.72 --> 8956.64
just data cross referencing data

8954.16 --> 8958.92
measurement information and all of it

8956.64 --> 8961.56
and put it all together and and also

8958.92 --> 8966.960000000001
mapping the mind how our mind

8961.56 --> 8970.278999999999
response how we are tested by lies and

8966.96 --> 8971.24
truth and how that influences everything

8970.279 --> 8974.720000000001
around

8971.24 --> 8976.119999999999
you and how that influences everything

8974.72 --> 8980.08
on the other

8976.12 --> 8982.640000000001
side on your spiritual experience and

8980.08 --> 8985.52
potentially your dreams and just all of

8982.64 --> 8990.24
it is one big

8985.52 --> 8996.319000000001
map and it's all God Creations all of it

8990.24 --> 8996.319
the dream realm waking realm all of

9006.52 --> 9012.720000000001
it to love others is to be your higher

9009.08 --> 9015.439
self yeah well to love others is to love

9012.72 --> 9018.438999999998
yourself to help others is to help

9015.439 --> 9018.439
yourself

9019.04 --> 9027.080000000002
but at the same time yeah if you're

9023.359 --> 9029.720000000001
helping others and then shortening on

9027.08 --> 9031.359
yourself well that's not good because

9029.72 --> 9035.039999999999
even though you might feel really good

9031.359 --> 9037.08
now you're shorten and so if you

9035.04 --> 9039.92
basically don't help yourself in favor

9037.08 --> 9043.84
of helping somebody else well then you

9039.92 --> 9047.72
will be less capable of helping other

9043.84 --> 9051.08
people because you didn't help yourself

9047.72 --> 9053.199999999999
H right and that's why you should always

9051.08 --> 9056.08
take care of yourself

9053.2 --> 9058.479000000001
first before you task yourself to take

9056.08 --> 9058.479
care of

9061.16 --> 9066.279
another cuz if you have a drive to help

9064.0 --> 9068.399
another well isn't that something that's

9066.279 --> 9069.960000000001
actually that should be prioritized

9068.399 --> 9072.199999999999
shouldn't people that want to help

9069.96 --> 9075.358999999999
others be

9072.2 --> 9078.800000000001
prioritized over just randomly

9075.359 --> 9081.24
anybody because the people that help

9078.8 --> 9083.72
others they need to be helped first

9081.24 --> 9086.24
because well they help

9083.72 --> 9088.76
others if you don't help them first well

9086.24 --> 9091.96
they might stop helping others and then

9088.76 --> 9094.439
you basically by not prioritizing them

9091.96 --> 9096.119999999999
decreased the amount of people getting

9094.439 --> 9102.04
helped

9096.12 --> 9102.04
out yeah that's literally rudimentary

9104.12 --> 9109.319000000001
logic that's why I say there is a

9106.8 --> 9109.319
difference

9110.68 --> 9117.720000000001
between productively

9113.56 --> 9120.96
selfish and irrationally

9117.72 --> 9124.479
selfish productively selfish

9120.96 --> 9126.8
is when you're making sure that you're

9124.479 --> 9129.92
being helped before you help others and

9126.8 --> 9129.92
then you proceed helping

9133.68 --> 9140.08
others right in instead of h no I just

9138.24 --> 9142.039999999999
want my gratification I just want to

9140.08 --> 9145.479
feel better than everybody in this

9142.04 --> 9147.76
moment so I'm going to be super selfish

9145.479 --> 9149.278999999999
is how people see that and it's not

9147.76 --> 9151.64
constructive because yeah you had your

9149.279 --> 9156.359
moment now feeling better and all that

9151.64 --> 9160.278999999999
but after that now you lost spiritual

9156.359 --> 9163.880000000001
Credit Now people won't like

9160.279 --> 9166.279
you and the moment of being all great

9163.88 --> 9169.399
and on top of things and being the man

9166.279 --> 9172.439
because you did that is going to fade

9169.399 --> 9175.24
it's not a durable

9172.439 --> 9178.68
thing and that's why there's a big

9175.24 --> 9183.8
difference between like effectively

9178.68 --> 9183.800000000001
constructively selfish and foolishly

9189.94 --> 9195.16
[Music]

9192.76 --> 9197.279
selfish that's very funny steamie

9195.16 --> 9199.64
Traveler I'm definitely not going to

9197.279 --> 9202.92
stop Banning trolls

9199.64 --> 9206.319
thanks cuz if I didn't the the chat will

9202.92 --> 9208.56
get all messed up all Spam filled with

9206.319 --> 9211.56
nonsense and you'd all be super

9208.56 --> 9213.92
distracted by it so I definitely got to

9211.56 --> 9213.92
ban the

9221.319 --> 9226.439
trolls how can I know that I have me

9223.84 --> 9229.2
trick with Satan to think like this

9226.439 --> 9231.800000000001
because I'm following logic and as long

9229.2 --> 9234.16
as I follow logic you can't be tricked

9231.8 --> 9236.88
by Satan Satan can only trick you when

9234.16 --> 9239.76
you abandon logic and

9236.88 --> 9242.319
truth because of another short-term

9239.76 --> 9244.399
priorities like oh I want to have it

9242.319 --> 9246.6
fixed right now so I'm going to go with

9244.399 --> 9246.599999999999
the

9246.68 --> 9253.6
shortcut thereby bypass logic make a

9250.08 --> 9257.0
little Leo logic and that's when you

9253.6 --> 9258.92
basically gave into Satan

9257.0 --> 9262.08
and the only way to prevent that is to

9258.92 --> 9263.960000000001
like never ever do that always let

9262.08 --> 9268.24
reality be

9263.96 --> 9270.08
tiresome and slow to catch on as long as

9268.24 --> 9271.64
you keep it straight in your head you're

9270.08 --> 9274.8
you're good it's not going to be

9271.64 --> 9277.96
pleasant it's not nice to be

9274.8 --> 9279.759999999998
right it sucks to be right and notice

9277.96 --> 9283.0
how everybody's going to ignore it and

9279.76 --> 9285.800000000001
be none the wiser for

9283.0 --> 9287.26
it but that's not an excuse to give it

9285.8 --> 9290.729
up

9287.26 --> 9290.729
[Music]

9292.2 --> 9297.800000000001
though but that's what it no no Tusk

9298.88 --> 9305.16
no who wants to think I'm too clever no

9301.88 --> 9308.16
you don't [ __ ] know what Satan

9305.16 --> 9308.16
is

9308.68 --> 9313.0
yeah as long as you follow logic and you

9311.399 --> 9318.0
don't lie to

9313.0 --> 9318.0
yourself Satan can't get you

9318.439 --> 9325.64
you he can only get you when you let

9322.08 --> 9325.64
slip when you get

9328.7 --> 9331.879
[Music]

9340.16 --> 9346.92
sloppy What If a troll was really Jesus

9344.0 --> 9349.52
testing what you believe oh good on him

9346.92 --> 9351.24
he can test all he like I'm I'm doing

9349.52 --> 9353.2
what I'm doing and even if this's

9351.24 --> 9356.0
literally Jesus on the other side I'm

9353.2 --> 9359.240000000002
going to do exactly what I'm going to do

9356.0 --> 9361.16
and if Jesus would be insulted somehow

9359.24 --> 9364.92
well then he's not very worthy as a

9361.16 --> 9364.92
Jesus and it's not the Jesus at

9374.92 --> 9377.92
all

9382.88 --> 9389.16
yeah besides I don't believe in a

9385.56 --> 9392.039999999999
literal physical Reincarnation of

9389.16 --> 9394.52
Jesus I don't believe in that at all I

9392.04 --> 9398.68
believe that he's on the other side

9394.52 --> 9402.16
permanently he is there with us

9398.68 --> 9406.12
permanently it's called the Holy Spirit

9402.16 --> 9409.76
or the the spirit of Christ the Christ

9406.12 --> 9414.399000000001
the Christ spirit it's what what is

9409.76 --> 9417.92
addressed as in Rudolph siner techniques

9414.399 --> 9421.479
the Christ Spirit he is not physical

9417.92 --> 9421.479
anymore he doesn't need to

9426.88 --> 9431.96
be sounds like something sat I don't

9429.64 --> 9435.039999999999
give a [ __ ] what you think Satan would

9431.96 --> 9438.16
say you don't understand Satan you don't

9435.04 --> 9440.92
understand God per my tradition and if

9438.16 --> 9443.24
you bypass that tradition and you use

9440.92 --> 9445.08
other parameters besides

9443.24 --> 9449.279
logic and

9445.08 --> 9452.039999999999
truth then I don't give a [ __ ] about

9449.279 --> 9454.04
however you see it cuz I don't see it

9452.04 --> 9456.92
like that and I don't care for any

9454.04 --> 9459.640000000001
Priestly thoughts or interpretations

9456.92 --> 9459.64
other than my

9464.12 --> 9470.880000000001
own I will listen listen to

9467.279 --> 9474.640000000001
it I will compare

9470.88 --> 9477.72
it that I don't actually care I don't

9474.64 --> 9479.519999999999
care how you see it I care how I see it

9477.72 --> 9482.119999999999
and it would be great if other people

9479.52 --> 9482.12
could see it

9487.64 --> 9492.96
too anybody who doesn't think like me

9490.359 --> 9495.279
doesn't know God well that all depends

9492.96 --> 9496.679999999998
on their definition of God and how they

9495.279 --> 9498.560000000001
see God

9496.68 --> 9503.12
God

9498.56 --> 9505.72
yeah Tusk are you trying to set me

9503.12 --> 9508.12
up are you trying to make me say

9505.72 --> 9512.319
something that I don't really want to

9508.12 --> 9516.04
say because I don't think that's

9512.319 --> 9519.399
relevant yeah you're expecting me see oh

9516.04 --> 9521.800000000001
my way is the only way Arwin is the only

9519.399 --> 9523.399
truth yeah what what you think that you

9521.8 --> 9524.399
[ __ ] [ __ ] what the [ __ ] are you

9523.399 --> 9527.72
doing

9524.399 --> 9527.72
here yeah

9528.04 --> 9532.880000000001
do I say that do I ever say

9534.64 --> 9537.64
that

9540.56 --> 9545.319
guys know trying to get to you your

9545.64 --> 9551.96
Bel it's a method I just explained it to

9549.319 --> 9557.0
you it's literally

9551.96 --> 9560.438999999998
that literally I do not personify God

9557.0 --> 9563.0
and I don't even personify Satan I see

9560.439 --> 9565.56
them as

9563.0 --> 9568.24
frequencies frequencies within the whole

9565.56 --> 9570.56
patterns that are there for us to follow

9568.24 --> 9574.52
or

9570.56 --> 9577.439
reject and God must

9574.52 --> 9581.0
exist or things can't

9577.439 --> 9583.24
work the very fabric of existence

9581.0 --> 9586.399
physical and

9583.24 --> 9590.68
informational can only exist in the way

9586.399 --> 9594.278999999999
they do if God was there to design

9590.68 --> 9594.279
manifest and maintain

9603.04 --> 9609.160000000002
it I'm being a dick right now I'm sorry

9605.76 --> 9609.16
I'm not being a r dick at

9614.56 --> 9617.56
all

9622.88 --> 9628.24
T well maybe maybe that's just because

9626.399 --> 9632.119999999999
the way that you ask

9628.24 --> 9634.279
it is insinuating and I'm very

9632.12 --> 9638.399000000001
suspicious of

9634.279 --> 9638.399000000001
that ever thought of that

9644.52 --> 9648.16
tusk

9646.52 --> 9650.880000000001
[Music]

9648.16 --> 9653.88
oh I don't the stupid oh so I didn't

9650.88 --> 9657.319
completely to detail answer your

9653.88 --> 9660.0
questions did I did I not in detail

9657.319 --> 9660.0
answer your

9668.8 --> 9676.479
question yeah and I'm sorry but have you

9672.279 --> 9679.04
ever ever asked anybody the question so

9676.479 --> 9681.84
anybody who doesn't think like you

9679.04 --> 9684.800000000001
doesn't know God have you ever asked

9681.84 --> 9688.479
that question to any person in the world

9684.8 --> 9690.8
and they weren't either fanatically go

9688.479 --> 9692.24
yes of course because it's my religion

9690.8 --> 9694.8
or they were

9692.24 --> 9697.8
insulted because I can't think how that

9694.8 --> 9702.0
would not be insulting unless you're a

9697.8 --> 9702.0
religious fanatic that believes in

9704.439 --> 9707.439
lies

9710.439 --> 9717.64
so yeah I'd like to hear that Tusk did I

9713.12 --> 9720.960000000001
not answer your question in utter

9717.64 --> 9724.16
detail Mr now complaining pants about oh

9720.96 --> 9727.039999999999
I I said you're a [ __ ] I was mean to

9724.16 --> 9730.2
you well maybe you should be careful on

9727.04 --> 9730.2
how to phrase these

9734.359 --> 9741.52
things cuz I suspected you were trying

9737.64 --> 9743.88
to be insulting I guess I was wrong but

9741.52 --> 9747.08
yeah the way you phrase

9743.88 --> 9747.08
that you

9759.24 --> 9765.439
know right and besides your insinuations

9762.96 --> 9768.358999999999
on how Satan is doing this and that and

9765.439 --> 9771.2
tricking and Al you're literally in that

9768.359 --> 9774.84
moment assigning a lot of power to Satan

9771.2 --> 9777.08
by saying that is a bad trait yeah

9774.84 --> 9778.359
that's also part of why I'm responding

9777.08 --> 9782.64
with

9778.359 --> 9782.640000000001
agitation because you ask the wrong

9783.319 --> 9788.64
questions and it's not oh you should not

9786.279 --> 9790.439
have done that no it's just that the way

9788.64 --> 9796.08
you

9790.439 --> 9799.6
acted was in my opinion not optimal

9796.08 --> 9801.8
it reveals problems dynamic problems

9799.6 --> 9803.2
about how you think and how you think

9801.8 --> 9806.278999999999
about

9803.2 --> 9810.68
Christianity and that made me a little

9806.279 --> 9814.12
bit more hostile and suspicious of you

9810.68 --> 9817.04
if you can't handle that yeah well get

9814.12 --> 9817.04
the hell out of here

9824.04 --> 9829.52
then so so yeah steamy traveler I'd

9826.76 --> 9830.399
really appreciate if if you didn't just

9829.52 --> 9833.720000000001
do

9830.399 --> 9835.96
that didn't try to get involved like

9833.72 --> 9838.64
your literal

9835.96 --> 9841.438999999998
family when I'm going back and forth

9838.64 --> 9844.319
with somebody I'd really appreciate if

9841.439 --> 9844.319
you wouldn't do

9854.2 --> 9858.560000000001
that

9856.319 --> 9861.8
okay can I can I get anybody else in

9858.56 --> 9866.56
here anybody doc Dr Bass

9861.8 --> 9868.56
award low fruit or Nathan mystical

9866.56 --> 9871.88
rockhound classical

9868.56 --> 9876.8
homeopath that one guy or even ritual

9871.88 --> 9879.199999999999
magic here could anybody tell me exactly

9876.8 --> 9883.08
like where I was being a prick that

9879.2 --> 9883.08
steamy traveler needed to say that

9884.16 --> 9887.16
twice

9888.92 --> 9896.439
where was I a

9891.399 --> 9898.278999999999
prick to say yeah when I said I think

9896.439 --> 9900.68
you're kind of a [ __ ] if that's even

9898.279 --> 9904.439
literally what I said when he in the

9900.68 --> 9907.64
middle of his interrogation says things

9904.439 --> 9910.720000000001
like sounds like something Satan would

9907.64 --> 9913.64
say yes but that's what Satan wants you

9910.72 --> 9917.76
to think he wants you to think that

9913.64 --> 9921.64
you're too clever for him like what kind

9917.76 --> 9925.2
of an inquiry is that how should I not

9921.64 --> 9928.399
be insulted to hear

9925.2 --> 9930.84
that you have Ser no steamy traveler you

9928.399 --> 9932.64

9932.64 --> 9939.72
mirror man I just Justified [ __ ] what

[ __ ] you think you are I mean I like you

pretending like you're my dad that knows

9956.279 --> 9962.08

10082.8 --> 10088.599999999999
things being formulated and then

10134.479 --> 10140.199999999999
to people's face in the chat that

10137.56 --> 10142.479
is I'd be a little bit more careful

10140.2 --> 10144.240000000002
careful in actual person because yeah

10142.479 --> 10147.0
people don't respond well to that but I

10144.24 --> 10150.0
[ __ ] well do that here I do that I

10150.0 --> 10152.92
feely about

10153.319 --> 10159.68
anything I dress things immediately no

10157.279 --> 10162.239

[Music]

10176.16 --> 10181.64
it

10179.04 --> 10183.04
yeah maybe you're just sick of me

10181.64 --> 10184.56
steaming traveler have you ever

10183.04 --> 10187.0
considered that you're just kind of sick

10184.56 --> 10189.039999999999
of of Me Maybe you don't want to follow

10187.0 --> 10192.0
me every day anymore maybe you just need

10189.04 --> 10194.52
to move on cuz this strain you can't

10192.0 --> 10196.74
handle it very well this is not your

10194.52 --> 10199.04
Arena you don't like Flat Earth debates

10196.74 --> 10201.68
[Music]

10199.04 --> 10205.560000000001
either well maybe then just find

10201.68 --> 10208.04
somebody that never ever gets into an

10205.56 --> 10210.16
argument with a nice Hearth in the

10208.04 --> 10214.84
background and nice soft voice and

10210.16 --> 10218.88
always nice yeah maybe go find that then

10214.84 --> 10222.68
because over here bickering happens

10218.88 --> 10225.72
feelings will get hurt at times and

10222.68 --> 10230.800000000001
people will be

10225.72 --> 10230.8
corrected and issues will be

10243.64 --> 10246.64
addressed

10263.0 --> 10266.96
sounds like my feelings hurt well I

10264.76 --> 10271.92
think that you're meddling in a way that

10266.96 --> 10271.919999999998
you don't have permission for me to do

10273.56 --> 10276.56
that

10283.319 --> 10287.039999999999
I mean I was ready to actually take your

10285.04 --> 10291.160000000002
wrench away from that but if I do that

10287.04 --> 10294.04
you'd probably go away and never come

10291.16 --> 10297.6
back but I really don't want you to do

10294.04 --> 10299.6
that again yeah I mean give me some

10297.6 --> 10301.76
comment if like if you have such a thing

10299.6 --> 10303.279
then just say it in don't [ __ ] do

10301.76 --> 10307.0
that in front of

10303.279 --> 10307.0
everybody when you're

10314.16 --> 10317.16
wrong

10324.439 --> 10332.880000000001
okay I'll do what I want you're not my

10327.8 --> 10335.278999999999
dad okay well in that case I will take

10332.88 --> 10337.278999999999
your wrench then

10335.279 --> 10340.359
and the next time you say something like

10337.279 --> 10345.0
that I will literally time you out

10340.359 --> 10348.239
then okay you can do what you want and

10345.0 --> 10348.239
that's going to be the price

10363.439 --> 10366.439
then

10373.359 --> 10380.12
right if Tusk still wants to further

10376.92 --> 10382.239
inquire that's fine he can ask further I

10380.12 --> 10384.04
I highlighted the issues that I had if

10382.239 --> 10388.039999999999
he doesn't well then he doesn't now he's

10384.04 --> 10388.04
can be all insulted he like

10393.04 --> 10397.279
whatever I can't answered most of his

10399.279 --> 10403.880000000001
questions yeah and I'm sorry if you're

10401.68 --> 10407.479000000001
going to ask something yeah I'm not

10403.88 --> 10409.96
always just going to be oh thank you and

10407.479 --> 10412.84
yeah sometimes I get cranky about it

10409.96 --> 10415.039999999999
sometimes I go a little far with it and

10412.84 --> 10417.6
then I usually recognize it and I

10415.04 --> 10419.319000000001
definitely don't have zero

10417.6 --> 10422.720000000001
self-awareness

10419.319 --> 10424.68
ever if I'm going a bit too far I notice

10422.72 --> 10427.72
it right just like when I went off

10424.68 --> 10433.439
against the morgal I absolutely notice

10427.72 --> 10435.039999999999
that yeah because I never ever have zero

10433.439 --> 10438.04
self-awareness

10435.04 --> 10438.04
yeah

10440.72 --> 10447.119999999999
ever I don't even have zero

10443.08 --> 10447.12
self-awareness when I [ __ ] sleep

10448.94 --> 10452.019
[Music]

10452.2 --> 10458.76
okay I can absolutely

10455.0 --> 10463.68
feel what I'm doing and and what that

10458.76 --> 10466.16
sounds like absolutely am I aware of

10463.68 --> 10469.16
what it does what comes out of

10466.16 --> 10469.16
me

10470.24 --> 10473.309
[Music]

10476.81 --> 10480.029999999999

10509.68 --> 10514.92
you

10511.6 --> 10518.720000000001
expect and I mean I do pretty much do

10514.92 --> 10518.72
three-hour shows standard now in the

10540.56 --> 10545.399
weekend like the concept of ler shows

10542.92 --> 10547.76
are wicked yeah me too no I've been but

10545.399 --> 10550.16
I mean I can do longer shows it

10547.76 --> 10552.399
definitely helps because well the first

10550.16 --> 10555.88
half hour usually I'm kind of

10552.399 --> 10557.76
slow have to get

10555.88 --> 10560.438999999998
going

10557.76 --> 10562.64
so and then it's all just depends on

10560.439 --> 10567.6
what's going to happen and

10562.64 --> 10570.0
how active I become on how long it can

10567.6 --> 10571.800000000001
last I mean I've been doing a three-hour

10570.0 --> 10574.96
show I haven't even eaten anything like

10571.8 --> 10579.8
an Illuminati C

10574.96 --> 10579.8
nothing just a Gusto energy drink that's

10581.61 --> 10584.78
[Music]

10602.6 --> 10611.76
all short t says today was a busy yeah

10606.84 --> 10613.12
it was very busy and I got into a clash

10611.76 --> 10616.439
at the

10613.12 --> 10620.479000000001
end and uh yeah

10616.439 --> 10623.0
whatever I mean I'm very agitated about

10620.479 --> 10625.72
that especially because I'm pretty damn

10623.0 --> 10629.399
sure this is not my

10625.72 --> 10632.319
fault I interpreted these things in a

10629.399 --> 10635.76
way that are Justified to interpret it

10632.319 --> 10640.0
that way and I addressed it the four and

10635.76 --> 10640.0
yet complaining complainy

10652.6 --> 10658.56
complaining

10655.479 --> 10661.319
right and I'm being a

10658.56 --> 10663.72
dick cuz I think it's insulting when

10661.319 --> 10666.76
somebody tells me oh that's what the

10663.72 --> 10670.039999999999
devil want you to believe like oh how

10666.76 --> 10673.04
should I interpret that as not being

10670.04 --> 10676.04
insulting like that's literally Satan

10673.04 --> 10676.04
gaslighting

10677.56 --> 10685.479
[ __ ] I don't buy

10681.16 --> 10687.76
that I'm not going to mystify anything

10685.479 --> 10687.76
like

10688.0 --> 10695.92
that I'm esoteric with it and very

10692.92 --> 10695.92
specific

10706.319 --> 10710.319
try to fight the flatter with ra the bit

10708.84 --> 10714.399
you couldn't understand the single what

10710.319 --> 10714.399
she was saying oh okay except

10714.439 --> 10718.08
tapy I stopped

10722.92 --> 10728.52
trying

10725.88 --> 10733.56
but weekends do seem to get like that in

10728.52 --> 10733.560000000001
your observation do they

10748.6 --> 10752.640000000001
H

10750.359 --> 10755.12
right I haven't even talked about

10752.64 --> 10761.56
anything that I was doing yesterday how

10755.12 --> 10766.279
weird is that oh Benjamin being epic

10761.56 --> 10766.278999999999
hilarious he's got some really good new

10768.239 --> 10773.96
Concepts

10770.56 --> 10773.96
and uh what

10782.84 --> 10785.84
else

10786.55 --> 10789.609999999999
[Music]

10793.84 --> 10798.399
it got a little awkward what is

10799.319 --> 10804.72
that oh yeah yeah on Flat Earth a bit

10805.399 --> 10812.599999999999
Yeah I'd be nervous as hell

10809.319 --> 10815.76
though I like might not even show up if

10812.6 --> 10815.76
he does that

10819.68 --> 10827.2
but I mean that would be at least very

10823.479 --> 10827.199999999999
interesting if he do

10830.6 --> 10835.960000000001
that so yeah Nathan was very interested

10833.76 --> 10837.399
in that like he asked me like hey Irwin

10835.96 --> 10839.759999999998
you're into that why don't you contact

10837.399 --> 10842.439
him I don't even know how to do

10839.76 --> 10844.479
that I mean I could just send an email

10842.439 --> 10847.239
but the guy gets like

10844.479 --> 10849.84
so much contact like how the hell would

10847.239 --> 10853.68
I should I expect that he'd even pick up

10849.84 --> 10857.04
on that at this point like I don't know

10853.68 --> 10859.960000000001
how to contact him like unless I like

10857.04 --> 10863.36
write him a letter or something that

10859.96 --> 10864.519999999999
could take a while before that even got

10863.36 --> 10867.399000000001
[Music]

10864.52 --> 10871.0
there from what I have seen Owen is more

10867.399 --> 10873.08
than a decent yeah no he's he's okay

10871.0 --> 10874.68
he's a bit discy though and he's on with

10873.08 --> 10880.239
the ether and all

10874.68 --> 10883.800000000001
that but uh yeah he's okay I don't think

10880.239 --> 10887.479
he's great at it I've talked about that

10883.8 --> 10891.08
that he gets messy he's not as good in

10887.479 --> 10894.239
physics as he thinks he is I'm sorry

10891.08 --> 10895.88
it's just that is it I'm sure he knows

10894.239 --> 10899.08
the numbers and he's very good at

10895.88 --> 10902.0
studying it and stuff but like I have a

10899.08 --> 10905.96
very complete oversight over these

10902.0 --> 10908.16
things micromechanic all that he doesn't

10905.96 --> 10910.88
seem to have that he has a couple of

10908.16 --> 10910.88
interesting

10912.359 --> 10918.710000000001
explanations and little factoids about

10915.359 --> 10921.74
observations and all that that are like

10918.71 --> 10921.74
[Music]

10922.72 --> 10927.88
legit but he's never been super

10925.04 --> 10927.880000000001
systematic with

10929.64 --> 10935.96
it and like he's done dealt with the

10932.64 --> 10938.64
scientific method and all that and then

10935.96 --> 10940.72
like almost get it good and then another

10938.64 --> 10943.399
time kind of mess it up again and get

10940.72 --> 10945.72
more colloquial science right so it's

10943.399 --> 10947.319
like all over the place man it's always

10945.72 --> 10949.84
been like that with

10947.319 --> 10952.359
him sometimes I wonder if he just do it

10949.84 --> 10955.2
just to like

10952.359 --> 10958.800000000001
create more cloud or something just

10955.2 --> 10958.800000000001
stuff happening because of it I don't

10962.359 --> 10966.439
know sometimes times I think that he

10964.6 --> 10968.319
might be watching The Flat Earth debates

10966.439 --> 10971.68
and then other times I think that he's

10968.319 --> 10971.68
absolutely never seen

10983.72 --> 10988.8
it there's a good chance he knows us

10986.439 --> 10991.16
guys

10988.8 --> 10992.479
maybe he certainly connected up with

10991.16 --> 10995.479
David

10992.479 --> 10995.479
Weiss

10995.88 --> 10999.92
but I think that he like sort of

10997.8 --> 11002.56
indirectly mentioned Flat Earth debates

10999.92 --> 11005.239
a while ago but he he mention how he

11002.56 --> 11007.08
really didn't like what he was hearing

11005.239 --> 11008.47
he just thinks that the energy and the

11007.08 --> 11009.96
attitudes is all

11008.47 --> 11013.479
[Music]

11009.96 --> 11016.519999999999
terrible and I really do Wonder like

11013.479 --> 11018.599999999999
does I I just don't know but I I got

11016.52 --> 11021.720000000001
this terrible suspicion that Owen

11018.6 --> 11024.880000000001
Benjamin like actually just in a natural

11021.72 --> 11028.679999999998
way despises me

11024.88 --> 11031.56
in a way that he can't really directly

11028.68 --> 11034.239
justify but that he just really doesn't

11031.56 --> 11037.92
like me and that he's avoiding me

11034.239 --> 11041.199999999999
because he doesn't just want to talk

11037.92 --> 11043.56
[ __ ] and I'm sure he could man he could

11041.2 --> 11046.76
talk all kinds of [ __ ] about me and it

11043.56 --> 11050.119999999999
would all be pretty

11046.76 --> 11054.239
legit I'm not an ideal person I'm not

11050.12 --> 11056.160000000002
like a a role model in that sense

11054.239 --> 11060.56
I got some certain missions but I'm

11056.16 --> 11060.56
definitely not role model material

11063.12 --> 11069.160000000002
okay well not from ow Benjamin's

11066.319 --> 11069.16
perspective

11071.76 --> 11078.319
like I he might respect Nathan because

11076.0 --> 11081.439
well he has a family he is providing for

11078.319 --> 11084.439
family and all that

11081.439 --> 11087.399
right I don't think I don't think he

11084.439 --> 11089.720000000001
just yeah I don't have kids I don't have

11087.399 --> 11095.519999999999
I'm social welfare

11089.72 --> 11098.679999999998
situation I smoke cannabis for a long

11095.52 --> 11101.239
time I have anger issue I just I think

11098.68 --> 11103.479000000001
that ow Benjamin just really thinks I'm

11101.239 --> 11105.72
a complete [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] and I

11103.479 --> 11107.56
just need to shut the [ __ ] up get a job

11105.72 --> 11109.399
and like never appear on the internet

11107.56 --> 11113.039999999999
again I I think that he might actually

11109.399 --> 11117.72
think that I don't know though because

11113.04 --> 11120.04
he's said my name one time and angrily

11117.72 --> 11122.76
and that's like the only [ __ ] time he

11120.04 --> 11125.720000000001
ever even said my

11122.76 --> 11127.76
name even though I've hung around chats

11125.72 --> 11130.16
and all that and I mention him on a

11127.76 --> 11132.279
daily basis I just think he really

11130.16 --> 11134.68
[ __ ] hates me and he's probably

11132.279 --> 11138.279
afraid that if he'd say that I just go

11134.68 --> 11141.16
out of control like freaking Jim Bob or

11138.279 --> 11143.0
something and hey I might if he just

11141.16 --> 11145.76
literally said all these things that I

11143.0 --> 11149.04
think he thinks about me I would

11145.76 --> 11151.84
probably like be really [ __ ] hurt and

11149.04 --> 11154.640000000001
it would probably never be

11151.84 --> 11157.56
fixed I would be like yeah now I'm

11154.64 --> 11159.519999999999
publicly humiliating by my hero that's

11157.56 --> 11163.08
never going to be fixed ever

11159.52 --> 11165.479000000001
again yeah he might actually be sizing

11163.08 --> 11165.479
that up

11167.92 --> 11173.72
correctly so I'm not super eager to like

11171.0 --> 11176.399
get in contact because I mean I think he

11173.72 --> 11179.0
just [ __ ] burned me down totally

11176.399 --> 11181.439
burned me down like

11179.0 --> 11184.239
deadly because he just can't [ __ ]

11181.439 --> 11187.64
stand me I really think Owen Benjamin

11184.239 --> 11191.439
can't absolutely can't stand

11187.64 --> 11191.439
me I'm not sure

11195.2 --> 11205.84
though angry no he was angry towards me

11198.72 --> 11210.438999999998
in his chat ter it his chat on D life

11205.84 --> 11213.479
years ago when he was still live on D

11210.439 --> 11215.800000000001
life why do I worship why why do you

11213.479 --> 11218.039999999999
keep asking stupid and annoying

11215.8 --> 11222.119999999999
questions stey

11218.04 --> 11222.12
traveler why do you keep doing

11229.12 --> 11235.92
that

11231.319 --> 11239.319
yeah I don't work ship Owen I I look up

11235.92 --> 11241.960000000001
to him I think he is pretty amazing and

11239.319 --> 11244.319
he's really right on about a whole bunch

11241.96 --> 11249.278999999999
of things and I'm looking up to him and

11244.319 --> 11251.519999999999
I try to be more like that I've adapted

11249.279 --> 11254.76
to him in many ways and it's been an

11251.52 --> 11254.76
adaptation for the

11259.8 --> 11266.679999999998
better yeah and I don't know if he

11263.279 --> 11270.68
actually hates me he's never literally

11266.68 --> 11274.479000000001
said that I think that he's avoiding me

11270.68 --> 11274.479000000001
potentially because he hates

11274.72 --> 11282.519999999999
me I mean it's perfectly fine getting

11279.359 --> 11284.68
attracted to squir his Stone before he

11282.52 --> 11287.439
went all ape [ __ ] on him even though

11284.68 --> 11290.12
he's like like sort of blatantly [ __ ]

11287.439 --> 11293.12
in ways I couldn't stand seconds of

11290.12 --> 11295.640000000001
watching his videos yeah or pull from

11293.12 --> 11298.359
pockets of the future like oh he loves

11295.64 --> 11303.039999999999
that though oh even though they are like

11298.359 --> 11305.640000000001
blatantly brutally flawed and very very

11303.04 --> 11307.800000000001
wrong in plain sight oh he love to

11305.64 --> 11309.399
follow that but yeah good old Arin no no

11307.8 --> 11311.599999999999
no because I have just a wrong

11309.399 --> 11314.16
combination of things or something I

11311.6 --> 11316.56
don't know man I don't know I don't know

11314.16 --> 11318.64
what the [ __ ] he thinks of Me Maybe he

11316.56 --> 11321.399
does doesn't know what the [ __ ] to think

11318.64 --> 11323.278999999999
of me maybe sometimes he just really

11321.399 --> 11325.439
hates me in the moment and other times s

11323.279 --> 11327.560000000001
he's just kind of cool with me and he

11325.439 --> 11330.64
doesn't know what to do with it I don't

11327.56 --> 11332.76
know I don't know somebody [ __ ] ask

11330.64 --> 11334.319
him I don't know what the [ __ ] Owen

11332.76 --> 11336.08
Benjamin thinks of

11334.319 --> 11340.84
me I'm

11336.08 --> 11340.84
not I'm not having a lot of hopes about

11342.399 --> 11347.56
it it doesn't

11344.56 --> 11349.96
matter I like him I like his humor is

11347.56 --> 11354.039999999999
very unique it's something very unique

11349.96 --> 11355.919999999998
that I very uniquely need

11354.04 --> 11360.080000000002
and I think he's doing a lot of good in

11355.92 --> 11362.84
this world and is very uniquely doing

11360.08 --> 11366.359
that and I'm learning a lot from him I'm

11362.84 --> 11369.8
getting a lot of good New Leads of

11366.359 --> 11369.800000000001
information through

11376.88 --> 11384.92
him and I'm just basically repealing to

11381.92 --> 11387.08
yeah I'm just just going to assume that

11384.92 --> 11389.279
ow Benjamin thinks I'm a [ __ ] piece

11387.08 --> 11392.92
of

11389.279 --> 11395.84
[ __ ] that I'm actually trash that I'm

11392.92 --> 11398.56
like a bike Thief but white and that I'm

11395.84 --> 11402.0
ashamed to my rais and etc etc I don't

11398.56 --> 11403.92
know it could be because well if I just

11402.0 --> 11407.439
think no of course he's going to love me

11403.92 --> 11410.399
I love him I think he's awesome yeah and

11407.439 --> 11413.08
then it turns out he isn't I'd be

11410.399 --> 11415.039999999999
absolutely destroyed and so that's why

11413.08 --> 11417.52
assuming that Owen Benjamin just thinks

11415.04 --> 11419.92
I'm a complete piece of trash I'm just

11417.52 --> 11422.68
going to assume that until he says the

11419.92 --> 11422.68
opposite to

11433.76 --> 11439.76
that what happened to his bararia it's

11436.72 --> 11441.64
still growing strong terret bararia is

11439.76 --> 11444.0
still very much

11441.64 --> 11449.278999999999
running there there's now like a yearly

11444.0 --> 11449.279
meeting that they have and it's amazing

11467.279 --> 11471.68
apparently H that's a good one classic

11471.76 --> 11476.04
homeopath

11473.84 --> 11476.04
yeah

11477.319 --> 11483.359
sure right I don't think Owen Benjamin

11479.92 --> 11487.960000000001
is a complete [ __ ] [ __ ] though at

11483.359 --> 11487.960000000001
all I just don't think he likes

11488.96 --> 11494.278999999999
me maybe he doesn't think about yeah

11491.88 --> 11496.358999999999
probably well Owen doesn't spend a lot

11494.279 --> 11500.560000000001
of time thinking about people that he

11496.359 --> 11502.319
doesn't like so yeah in that sense yeah

11500.56 --> 11505.56
it's logic that he doesn't think about

11502.319 --> 11507.319
me at all all because he probably

11505.56 --> 11509.08
despises me and then he's not going to

11507.319 --> 11511.64
think about me because that would be a

11509.08 --> 11511.64
waste of his

11519.0 --> 11523.76
energy oh when is fond of J oh

11524.359 --> 11529.6
yes so what tells you about Oden that

11527.56 --> 11531.88
he's a freaking bimbo and he likes

11529.6 --> 11534.56
[ __ ] retards that's what it tells me

11531.88 --> 11536.72
about him and thus far it seems to like

11534.56 --> 11537.76
be coming out that that's actually a

11536.72 --> 11540.358999999999
good

11537.76 --> 11542.16
assessment yeah Owen Benjamin likes

11540.359 --> 11545.239
[ __ ]

11542.16 --> 11548.16
retards that eventually then turn on him

11545.239 --> 11550.16
and turn into complete gamma spazzes

11548.16 --> 11552.6
that seems to be a pattern that's

11550.16 --> 11554.119999999999
happening around Owen Benjamin he has

11552.6 --> 11555.2
issues with it he knows that he has

11554.12 --> 11558.880000000001
issues with

11555.2 --> 11560.68
that so yeah I'm not surprised at all if

11558.88 --> 11563.839999999998
he really likes Jared well that's

11560.68 --> 11566.2
because he likes [ __ ] ret ards he

11563.84 --> 11568.0
just can't help himself like a oh look

11566.2 --> 11569.92
at that cute little [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm

11568.0 --> 11573.84
going to like him he needs my

11569.92 --> 11573.84
protection I think that's just

11576.2 --> 11582.08
Owen maybe it's the money no it's

11579.16 --> 11582.08
definitely not the

11591.56 --> 11596.84
money

11594.12 --> 11599.880000000001
you like the spirit of David yeah no I'm

11596.84 --> 11602.04
fine with David Wise I kind of

11599.88 --> 11604.519999999999
considered him as a friend but I mean he

11602.04 --> 11607.399000000001
has been acting a bit dickish here and

11604.52 --> 11609.239
there it's not good I don't like that

11607.399 --> 11611.439
it's just going like that between him

11609.239 --> 11611.439
and

11612.2 --> 11618.92
Nathan but I mean David White does get

11616.2 --> 11621.560000000001
super sloppy and messy though he does

11618.92 --> 11624.56
[ __ ] up debates and

11621.56 --> 11624.56
[ __ ]

11627.8 --> 11631.119999999999

11818.399 --> 11824.68
okay is a good pnis yeah

11821.359 --> 11824.68
yeah he's

11827.08 --> 11831.439
cool but most of all what I really like

11829.84 --> 11833.6
about Owen Benjamin is that he's so

11831.439 --> 11836.199
freaking fluid

11833.6 --> 11839.640000000001
in the sense that he's he doesn't have

11836.199 --> 11841.399000000001
pauses I have pauses where I'm just like

11839.64 --> 11844.599999999999
really need a moment of silence to try

11841.399 --> 11849.198999999999
to recalibrate myself he doesn't need it

11844.6 --> 11849.199
he just keeps going find it very

11851.64 --> 11857.8
impressive and he's just really good at

11854.279 --> 11860.04
like prefacing a story too like he's a

11857.8 --> 11862.96
better more entertaining Storyteller

11860.04 --> 11866.92
than I am I'm I'm mostly here to be

11862.96 --> 11871.519999999999
explicable to make things understandable

11866.92 --> 11874.68
but just he knows to be just so

11871.52 --> 11877.199
entertaining I'm a bit jealous of it I'm

11874.68 --> 11879.880000000001
working on it but I mean I'm never be as

11877.199 --> 11883.399000000001
good as he is I

11879.88 --> 11883.399
think probably

11891.12 --> 11894.12
not

11901.88 --> 11905.8
right anyway I think I'm going to round

11903.8 --> 11910.0
out the show it's been over 3 hours and

11905.8 --> 11910.0
15 minutes and I'm getting kind of

11914.56 --> 11921.119999999999
hungry the best story Terrors are

11918.439 --> 11922.84
explicable

11921.12 --> 11925.12
yeah

11922.84 --> 11928.279
but you also have to have something to

11925.12 --> 11931.960000000001
tell and Owen always has something to

11928.279 --> 11934.479000000001
talk about I sometimes just don't have

11931.96 --> 11936.96
anything to talk about and it's a

11934.479 --> 11939.599999999999
reoccurring thing I've never seen Owen

11936.96 --> 11939.599999999999
be in that

11951.04 --> 11955.84
position

11953.8 --> 11957.92
trolling the globe no I think it's a

11955.84 --> 11960.359
terrible idea I think just getting

11957.92 --> 11963.52
caught up in some dichotomy Zep tappy is

11960.359 --> 11963.52
a complete waste of

11965.239 --> 11973.64
time but anyway I'm going to run out the

11968.92 --> 11976.439
show it's a rucky rucky

11973.64 --> 11978.479
