coming

88.68 --> 93.32000000000001
right so whether today is

95.06 --> 100.92
and there it goes my camera is so

98.159 --> 104.10000000000001
glitchy today like froze up like four

100.92 --> 110.7
times before I even started the show

104.1 --> 114.02
right anyway it's kind of cloudy outside

110.7 --> 114.02
less windy

115.619 --> 119.579
still a couple of blue spots in between

117.659 --> 120.71900000000001
there but yeah overall it's kind of

119.579 --> 125.41999999999999
clouded

120.719 --> 125.41999999999999
it's not raining or anything though

140.34 --> 143.0
all right

145.64 --> 149.35999999999999
and there he goes again

155.04 --> 161.9
my gamble standby now

158.28 --> 161.9
keeps happening constantly

165.36 --> 171.59900000000002
hello Jess Palmer first in chat

168.599 --> 174.11999999999998
Elise G good to see you

171.599 --> 180.06
Terry 306

174.12 --> 180.06
it is Wednesday the 27th of April 2022

182.54 --> 187.099
yeah yesterday's show was pretty cool

187.64 --> 192.35999999999999
I regret not having watched it back I

190.5 --> 194.459
did want to watch it back but it was

192.36 --> 197.0
plenty of interesting other things to

194.459 --> 197.0
distract me

197.459 --> 203.099
uh hello Matthew Hall

199.98 --> 206.159
yeah despite there being no life letters

203.099 --> 209.76
debate yesterday surprisingly

206.159 --> 211.85999999999999
Nathan had some family issue to tend to

209.76 --> 214.519
apparently hope there's going to be a

211.86 --> 214.519
live show today

215.7 --> 219.2
of letter Sage

225.78 --> 228.44
right

229.68 --> 235.519
so

232.2 --> 235.51899999999998
yeah all kinds of things

236.64 --> 241.2
I checked out some yeah part of the

238.799 --> 243.239
stream of own Benjamin apparently he got

241.2 --> 246.35999999999999
kicked off rockfin

243.239 --> 248.519
in a really embarrassing way like it

246.36 --> 250.799
happened to him again

248.519 --> 253.159
somebody got all scared

250.799 --> 257.659
over his content

253.159 --> 257.659
it's it's really pathetic

260.519 --> 264.96
and it's it's kind of weird because I

262.68 --> 267.979
had this weird feeling about rockfin at

264.96 --> 267.979
a distance for a while

269.46 --> 275.34
so I guess this is like one of the first

272.16 --> 278.94
signs like yeah it's not

275.34 --> 281.58
it's not what everybody's hoping it is

278.94 --> 285.5
I'm just sticking to YouTube and like I

281.58 --> 285.5
said yesterday I'm not banned

288.0 --> 294.18
it's not like a

290.34 --> 296.84
I'm super tidy and PC or anything if you

294.18 --> 296.84000000000003
know what I mean

302.34 --> 308.11999999999995
which is by the way still kind of a

304.38 --> 308.12
puzzle to me like why

310.979 --> 317.15999999999997
like is it because of the yeah the the

315.06 --> 318.06
things that I also occupy myself with

317.16 --> 321.18
the

318.06 --> 323.46
the smarter things like is that does

321.18 --> 327.0
that make it worth it

323.46 --> 329.18
to the guys that are tending to my

327.0 --> 329.18
channel

329.639 --> 334.919
moderating it

332.58 --> 338.4
are they like okay well at least he

334.919 --> 341.0
talks about like really state of the art

338.4 --> 341.0
things

341.4 --> 348.35999999999996
is that it or is it because yeah

345.78 --> 350.63899999999995
I've kind of just been ignored like are

348.36 --> 353.40000000000003
they just ignoring me which is very odd

350.639 --> 357.68
by the way if that's the case

353.4 --> 357.67999999999995
so I don't really know why

357.72 --> 361.5
my channel doesn't get as many strikes

359.88 --> 363.36
as others

361.5 --> 365.58
right and we've reasoned it out even

363.36 --> 369.24
like with Nathan Oakley who's been

365.58 --> 371.9
very on to that but the spell of the

369.24 --> 371.90000000000003
current thing

371.94 --> 377.46
the thing is though that I do talk about

375.06 --> 379.8
the current thing all the time and I'm

377.46 --> 384.18
very expressive about it

379.8 --> 386.66
I just kind of like managed to

384.18 --> 390.24
not get caught up

386.66 --> 392.41900000000004
in the wind gusts that like sweep that

390.24 --> 392.419
away

392.699 --> 398.58000000000004
and then you get a strike or something

394.28 --> 400.44
it just I managed to avoid that but I do

398.58 --> 403.02
talk about everything and I'm very

400.44 --> 407.639
non-pc

403.02 --> 412.44
very outspoken about it and like

407.639 --> 415.74
like arguably go a little too far

412.44 --> 418.21999999999997
right I wouldn't necessarily disagree

415.74 --> 418.22
with that

419.699 --> 422.36
anyway

423.12 --> 429.3
yeah um Benjamin does not have that

425.88 --> 431.94
luxury this is

429.3 --> 434.22
but then again like he is like actively

431.94 --> 435.66
pushing it it's part of his gig it's

434.22 --> 438.36
part of what he does

435.66 --> 439.91900000000004
and he yeah he does get a lot of props

438.36 --> 443.84000000000003
he does get a lot of

439.919 --> 443.84
people that really appreciate it

443.94 --> 449.58
even when he like directly shames or

447.419 --> 451.46
whatever targets their group ridicules

449.58 --> 453.78
their group

451.46 --> 455.4
they like it

453.78 --> 457.85999999999996
which is good

455.4 --> 460.919
he shouldn't be targeted over that it's

457.86 --> 462.90000000000003
funny because to me by now

460.919 --> 464.46
also since own Benjamin is kind of

462.9 --> 467.4
crawling around um

464.46 --> 469.25899999999996
social media to me he is like it's the

467.4 --> 470.94
Owen Benjamin test

469.259 --> 474.12
right

470.94 --> 476.28
like you have an alternative platform

474.12 --> 478.08
you get the Owen Benjamin test he's

476.28 --> 479.94
gonna try to come on to you if

478.08 --> 482.34
somebody's gonna be all triggered and

479.94 --> 487.28
like oh it's too scary it's dangerous

482.34 --> 487.28
then you fail the Owen Benjamin test

487.44 --> 493.44
and that means that you're yeah

491.039 --> 497.21999999999997
it's only a matter of time before you

493.44 --> 500.759
are the next level of the Beast system

497.22 --> 504.68
so that's how I look at it

500.759 --> 504.68
anyway hello to monoi too

505.979 --> 510.539
I also heard by the way through lift de

508.259 --> 512.399
Ville which is sometimes catches streams

510.539 --> 514.5
at night

512.399 --> 517.62
Nathan Stoltman

514.5 --> 519.0
apparently Google also lost like a huge

517.62 --> 523.82
amount of money

519.0 --> 523.82
I had no idea I don't even know why

526.62 --> 532.519
but yeah that happened apparently a

529.44 --> 532.519
logical conclusion

532.98 --> 536.7
some would argue that this channel

534.839 --> 539.22
doesn't get enough people watching to

536.7 --> 541.5600000000001
worry about yes I already mentioned that

539.22 --> 544.22
as a possibility

541.56 --> 544.2199999999999
but

549.72 --> 555.779
it doesn't technically match

553.26 --> 558.06
other people

555.779 --> 562.22
that do get strikes

558.06 --> 562.2199999999999
right that have small channels

562.32 --> 566.339
because other there's like smaller

564.3 --> 570.0799999999999
Channels with even less subscribers that

566.339 --> 570.08
still do get strikes and [ __ ]

570.18 --> 575.8389999999999
so

572.54 --> 575.8389999999999
I don't know

576.12 --> 582.44
I don't know how

578.16 --> 582.4399999999999
much you should hang on to that notion

586.44 --> 591.5400000000001
I don't think people are scared about no

588.3 --> 593.9399999999999
but not literally scared it is kind of

591.54 --> 596.2199999999999
butt hurt and but it's not scared of

593.94 --> 598.5600000000001
Owen it's scared of other people

596.22 --> 601.82
complaining about Owen that's what

598.56 --> 601.8199999999999
they're scared of you see

602.459 --> 609.66
like the platform owners are scared of

605.459 --> 613.9799999999999
the butthole hurt breaks from Hollywood

609.66 --> 617.0
PC gang did the woke gang that's what

613.98 --> 617.0
they're really afraid of

617.82 --> 624.2600000000001
not Owen himself but I doubt that that

620.76 --> 624.26
would be really silly

629.64 --> 635.04
that's right Derek 306 that's that's my

632.82 --> 637.2600000000001
estimation as well the algorithm

635.04 --> 640.26
wouldn't care

637.26 --> 642.6
how yeah how many views or

640.26 --> 645.3
subscribers you got

642.6 --> 648.44
they would just give you that treatment

645.3 --> 648.4399999999999
but for some reason

648.66 --> 653.8199999999999
have I been given like a protection

650.94 --> 655.3800000000001
status and if so why

653.82 --> 658.62
why

655.38 --> 660.42
like I'm a flat earther I have flat

658.62 --> 662.339
earth in every title

660.42 --> 666.18
it doesn't

662.339 --> 669.3000000000001
really make sense to me

666.18 --> 671.76
but then again yeah if it just keeps

669.3 --> 675.42
going and I can keep doing what I do the

671.76 --> 677.579
way that I do it then yeah I don't have

675.42 --> 679.3199999999999
a problem technically I only really have

677.579 --> 682.68
a problem when I don't have enough

679.32 --> 685.38
finances to get around

682.68 --> 688.62
right and for that having more

685.38 --> 691.74
subscribers is kind of handy so it's not

688.62 --> 693.839
like I'm in the ultimate win position

691.74 --> 696.6
no

693.839 --> 700.1400000000001
it would be kind of cool if I had like

696.6 --> 701.22
10 times the amount of viewers and

700.14 --> 703.62
supporters

701.22 --> 705.4200000000001
that would be extremely helpful and I

703.62 --> 706.399
would be doing pretty much the same

705.42 --> 709.079
thing

706.399 --> 711.54
well I would probably be less

709.079 --> 714.0
complaining about why are you silent for

711.54 --> 717.36
four minutes right right that's probably

714.0 --> 719.16
then not gonna happen anymore

717.36 --> 722.899
so

719.16 --> 722.899
yeah I don't know

726.3 --> 732.779
but for some of you that like like the

728.94 --> 735.4200000000001
puzzle out things puzzle things

732.779 --> 736.98
I'd like to get to think about like why

735.42 --> 740.04
me here

736.98 --> 744.0
why do I get away with like everything

740.04 --> 746.399
and like very unapologetically

744.0 --> 748.2
I'm like super Unapologetic you've known

746.399 --> 750.48
you've noticed this people like have

748.2 --> 752.22
being halfway like oh complaining pants

750.48 --> 754.139
about some detail and I'm like yeah [ __ ]

752.22 --> 757.5
you I'm just doing that

754.139 --> 759.12
here are some more boom nothing happens

757.5 --> 761.519
after that

759.12 --> 763.88
they squirt that's what happens and

761.519 --> 763.88
that's it

768.66 --> 774.54
to could it be perhaps because of some

771.66 --> 777.48
hashtags I've wondered could it be

774.54 --> 779.399
because I put in hashtag Trump as a

777.48 --> 781.38
shield in the list

779.399 --> 783.66
which has the story of its own right

781.38 --> 786.8389999999999
because it doesn't mean I hate Trump I

783.66 --> 788.459
don't hate Trump I just think that he

786.839 --> 792.12
typically

788.459 --> 795.18
operates and has talents for

792.12 --> 796.86
what chills do

795.18 --> 801.26
right but

796.86 --> 801.26
see so what's going on here

801.48 --> 809.1800000000001
what kind of marks do they put on me to

805.019 --> 809.18
categorize me I really wonder

819.86 --> 825.42
is that really territory that's an

822.959 --> 828.42
interesting way to say that

825.42 --> 831.24
Flat Earth channels get humans aside and

828.42 --> 834.0
cannot create algorithms to stop them

831.24 --> 836.279
they're too clever and quick huh

834.0 --> 838.62
well probably on average is probably

836.279 --> 840.8389999999999
true

838.62 --> 843.18
right we flat earthers deal with

840.839 --> 844.32
psychological warfare more than any

843.18 --> 846.18
other group

844.32 --> 849.839
probably

846.18 --> 851.8199999999999
bar may be like more politically active

849.839 --> 854.4200000000001
groups but yeah they seek it out

851.82 --> 854.4200000000001
constantly

855.6 --> 858.32
uh

858.54 --> 862.459
but I don't know

862.98 --> 867.0600000000001
about the algorithms like

865.26 --> 870.0
aren't the algorithms pretty

867.06 --> 872.76
sophisticated and then if so like how

870.0 --> 875.42
are the people assigned to us like how

872.76 --> 875.42
does that work

875.699 --> 880.5
are they just

877.68 --> 883.56
trying to act like that algorithm and

880.5 --> 886.32
Mark words or something

883.56 --> 888.5999999999999
or Divine meaning

886.32 --> 890.88
like I don't know

888.6 --> 892.32
I'd like to talk to one of those

890.88 --> 895.079
analysts

892.32 --> 896.88
right if there is somebody checking my

895.079 --> 898.5
channel

896.88 --> 901.079
yeah it's not going to work if you're

898.5 --> 903.24
just a troll piece of [ __ ] I'm not gonna

901.079 --> 906.06
believe you but if you're like yeah I

903.24 --> 908.339
was actually assigned by YouTube team or

906.06 --> 910.079
I don't know some company to

908.339 --> 912.72
to keep track of what your activities

910.079 --> 915.3599999999999
and Report I'd like to kind of know

912.72 --> 917.76
about it I'd I'd be open for a

915.36 --> 920.279
conversation with you about it

917.76 --> 922.399
starting in chat but maybe on Skype too

920.279 --> 925.4399999999999
right and you're gonna have to actually

922.399 --> 929.1
put down some proof too

925.44 --> 931.3800000000001
that you're not just making it up

929.1 --> 933.48
and there's many bore trolls out there

931.38 --> 936.92
that'll latch on to anything but yeah

933.48 --> 936.9200000000001
I'm gonna see through that

937.5 --> 945.079
they fear ragewind well but fearing

942.06 --> 945.079
rage win

949.74 --> 953.759
like flutter sit yeah

952.44 --> 956.1
okay

953.759 --> 958.139
sure sure they fear rage win they should

956.1 --> 960.5400000000001
fear rage win

958.139 --> 962.4590000000001
yeah it's a force in nature that I'm

960.54 --> 965.579
expressing right there

962.459 --> 966.7199999999999
like that's that's beyond just me as a

965.579 --> 970.1389999999999
person

966.72 --> 971.399
when I act like that right

970.139 --> 975.42
but

971.399 --> 978.42
I don't see how that relates to me

975.42 --> 981.06
not getting mad like wouldn't them

978.42 --> 983.8389999999999
fearing that be like a sufficient reason

981.06 --> 987.2399999999999
to actually kind of like no this is

983.839 --> 989.5790000000001
encouraging violence or something right

987.24 --> 992.04
and of course I'm gonna have like a

989.579 --> 994.38
Judicial response to that and say like

992.04 --> 997.62
no but I'm not really

994.38 --> 1001.04
like encouraging targeting of specific

997.62 --> 1005.18
individuals Etc even though

1001.04 --> 1007.5999999999999
I'm like really on the border of that on

1005.18 --> 1007.5999999999999
purpose

1007.699 --> 1010.4799999999999
so

1012.5 --> 1017.0
I mean if it's that complicated then

1014.54 --> 1018.98
it's almost like there would be literal

1017.0 --> 1022.959
lawyers

1018.98 --> 1022.9590000000001
assigned to check my channel

1023.6 --> 1026.72
well if so I'd like to kind of know

1025.64 --> 1030.5200000000002
about it

1026.72 --> 1030.52
and I'd like some

1030.679 --> 1034.4
like I like to hear about their findings

1032.959 --> 1037.22
and like

1034.4 --> 1039.799
risk points that they see like I like to

1037.22 --> 1041.78
see how they would see me and how they

1039.799 --> 1044.059
judge me

1041.78 --> 1047.059
because I am actually up for improvement

1044.059 --> 1051.44
even if it is from like a technically

1047.059 --> 1054.08
hostile Source right it's how I use

1051.44 --> 1057.559
trolls yes that's right trolls oh you

1054.08 --> 1058.84
think you're so smart no I use you

1057.559 --> 1062.36
yeah

1058.84 --> 1064.9399999999998
using you like a slave that's not in

1062.36 --> 1068.9599999999998
control of themselves thank you

1064.94 --> 1072.46
for giving me your soul to do with as I

1068.96 --> 1072.46
see fit troll

1075.12 --> 1078.6299999999999
[Music]

1083.77 --> 1089.78
[Music]

1086.66 --> 1093.14
they always have an eye on you

1089.78 --> 1095.8999999999999
little sure they have

1093.14 --> 1097.039
I don't know how that's gonna achieve

1095.9 --> 1099.0800000000002
anything though

1097.039 --> 1101.84
I've already like

1099.08 --> 1106.8799999999999
even declared

1101.84 --> 1110.36
years ago like I have surrendered to the

1106.88 --> 1112.5800000000002
notion that I have no actual privacy

1110.36 --> 1115.34
that I'm always being watched like even

1112.58 --> 1119.12
when there's no cameras

1115.34 --> 1121.48
like that might be right it might I

1119.12 --> 1123.799
might be like under internet like

1121.48 --> 1126.32
inter-dimensional watch

1123.799 --> 1128.4189999999999
because of some of the crazy [ __ ] that I

1126.32 --> 1129.86
experienced in the past

1128.419 --> 1133.46
so

1129.86 --> 1135.6789999999999
I'm okay with that well not like it's

1133.46 --> 1137.72
not like I like it

1135.679 --> 1140.26
or that I think that everybody should

1137.72 --> 1140.26
have that

1140.539 --> 1145.66
but I

1143.179 --> 1145.66
can

1146.78 --> 1151.039
it's like being a public figure even

1149.36 --> 1153.86
though I'm

1151.039 --> 1156.86
almost anonymous because not that many

1153.86 --> 1159.02
people seem to know me or would not

1156.86 --> 1161.24
openly admit it

1159.02 --> 1164.24
but probably they really don't know me

1161.24 --> 1167.72
out here nobody really knows me except

1164.24 --> 1170.0
for the guy in Black that just

1167.72 --> 1172.039
goes around on his bike

1170.0 --> 1173.96
that's it that's probably all they know

1172.039 --> 1176.12
about me

1173.96 --> 1181.059
I don't get people walking up to me like

1176.12 --> 1181.059
hey I know you from that Flat Earth show

1182.539 --> 1189.679
that yeah that only happened like once

1186.919 --> 1192.919
and the wife of a follower

1189.679 --> 1194.9
I'll kill the hope came up to me at my

1192.919 --> 1196.94
supermarket and it's like hey I know you

1194.9 --> 1199.46
whoa

1196.94 --> 1202.0
happened once just once

1199.46 --> 1202.0
so

1202.94 --> 1207.5
my cell phone is surely watching no I

1206.179 --> 1209.8400000000001
doubt it

1207.5 --> 1212.6
my cell phone doesn't even have internet

1209.84 --> 1215.26
capabilities I mean sure it's listening

1212.6 --> 1215.26
sure

1215.96 --> 1220.52
right

1218.24 --> 1223.28
but I'm always me

1220.52 --> 1227.24
the way that I'm over here

1223.28 --> 1229.7
I am always like that when I'm on my own

1227.24 --> 1231.98
I act the same

1229.7 --> 1233.9
I like yeah it sounds a bit weird maybe

1231.98 --> 1236.539
to some people but I do kind of like

1233.9 --> 1239.659
talk to the air

1236.539 --> 1241.58
and I am like this

1239.659 --> 1245.2600000000002
right when I don't have somebody to talk

1241.58 --> 1245.26
to I just talk to The Ether

1247.159 --> 1250.179
hey what's that

1256.88 --> 1259.24
oh

1265.46 --> 1268.96
that's in this G

1293.6 --> 1296.5
ah

1307.39 --> 1310.5990000000002
[Music]

1316.419 --> 1321.2800000000002
[ __ ] sake

1318.559 --> 1321.28
dude

1330.71 --> 1341.179
[Music]

1339.26 --> 1345.8799999999999
uh yeah sorry for getting distracted

1341.179 --> 1345.88
there my Skype uh or was I

1347.179 --> 1350.179
Young

1351.08 --> 1355.539
someone's always listening God writes

1365.69 --> 1369.529
[Music]

1369.679 --> 1373.9
right so another thing that also

1371.659 --> 1373.9
happened

1374.179 --> 1379.3400000000001
was yeah yesterday somebody in my chat

1377.48 --> 1382.159
notified me that

1379.34 --> 1384.62
can wheeler went on with like David

1382.159 --> 1385.8200000000002
Weiss and Bob nodell and Jaron or

1384.62 --> 1388.3999999999999
something

1385.82 --> 1389.72
I was like oh my God all right of course

1388.4 --> 1392.179
they did

1389.72 --> 1394.4
I did actually watch part of that but I

1392.179 --> 1397.7
got through half an hour and then I I

1394.4 --> 1400.52
was just like I can't do this anymore I

1397.7 --> 1403.1200000000001
I can't listen to it more like that she

1400.52 --> 1403.12
can't do it

1403.94 --> 1407.799
it was just embarrassing

1412.4 --> 1417.38
so yeah the guys in Skype had a field

1415.34 --> 1419.6
day over that

1417.38 --> 1421.8200000000002
I'll bet if there is going to be a live

1419.6 --> 1424.299
uh Flat Earth debates today it will be

1421.82 --> 1424.299
addressed

1446.72 --> 1451.1000000000001
I read the community guidelines from

1449.48 --> 1453.2
YouTube

1451.1 --> 1455.98
no not really

1453.2 --> 1455.98
partially

1456.08 --> 1462.86
I I go I don't really read them anymore

1459.679 --> 1466.7
I I simply go by

1462.86 --> 1470.299
a basic logic framework and that is that

1466.7 --> 1473.419
yeah if something is really intense and

1470.299 --> 1476.0
happening right now

1473.419 --> 1477.5590000000002
and there are definitely some keywords

1476.0 --> 1479.6
yeah you can grab a lot of attention

1477.559 --> 1481.6399999999999
that's how you get a strike that's how

1479.6 --> 1485.48
you get into trouble

1481.64 --> 1489.7990000000002
so I literally just don't address [ __ ]

1485.48 --> 1490.76
like even if everybody else has to talk

1489.799 --> 1494.02
about it

1490.76 --> 1494.02
I just don't do it

1494.48 --> 1502.279
and sometimes I do address it

1498.32 --> 1505.6589999999999
for me if I want to talk about it

1502.279 --> 1508.1
and I don't get into the standard

1505.659 --> 1510.7990000000002
dialogue that people then typically

1508.1 --> 1514.58
would enroll over all that and connect

1510.799 --> 1516.98
it to the great conspiracy of Satan or

1514.58 --> 1518.46
whatever it is

1516.98 --> 1519.679
hmm

1518.46 --> 1522.5
[Music]

1519.679 --> 1524.72
a nothing Burger on fed today what are

1522.5 --> 1528.34
you talking about

1524.72 --> 1528.34
Tony Whitcomb hello by the way

1533.779 --> 1537.74
I wasn't getting there an anti-war

1535.88 --> 1540.4
activist

1537.74 --> 1540.4
I don't know

1540.62 --> 1543.6999999999998
if you say so

1546.98 --> 1553.779
I just know that

1550.1 --> 1553.779
he's a technobabler

1556.159 --> 1559.7600000000002
I mean he's not the worst attack no

1558.44 --> 1564.5800000000002
babblers

1559.76 --> 1564.58
but he is a technobabler

1565.4 --> 1570.44
he's more proficient and seeming like he

1568.52 --> 1572.9
is in control and very smart about

1570.44 --> 1576.0800000000002
things

1572.9 --> 1578.3600000000001
then he actually has a full grip on

1576.08 --> 1580.34
everything like I can sense that I'm

1578.36 --> 1582.9799999999998
sorry everybody can go squirt over that

1580.34 --> 1586.82
oh you think you're so smarter yeah yeah

1582.98 --> 1589.88
I can literally sense that that's

1586.82 --> 1591.3799999999999
I've kind of studied that guy now for

1589.88 --> 1593.2990000000002
years

1591.38 --> 1595.279
just a couple of glances see how he

1593.299 --> 1597.02
develops see what he does see how he

1595.279 --> 1600.08
does it

1597.02 --> 1602.12
how he tricks himself out of situations

1600.08 --> 1604.6999999999998
using technobabble he's very

1602.12 --> 1606.26
sophisticated at it right he's really

1604.7 --> 1609.38
good at that

1606.26 --> 1612.44
doesn't mean he actually understands and

1609.38 --> 1613.7600000000002
he reifies things

1612.44 --> 1616.279
like

1613.76 --> 1618.3799999999999
on a glance like in the moment just

1616.279 --> 1620.179
quickly reify things

1618.38 --> 1622.279
and then move on and you might even

1620.179 --> 1623.8400000000001
point at it and be like hey but you're

1622.279 --> 1624.98
reifying and then he will suddenly

1623.84 --> 1627.86
address it

1624.98 --> 1630.679
and try to kind of almost lawyer speak

1627.86 --> 1633.08
techno Babble his way through again he's

1630.679 --> 1637.1200000000001
very good at that right

1633.08 --> 1637.12
but if you all put it all together

1638.779 --> 1645.26
yeah he's just he's chasing aberrations

1643.399 --> 1647.299
there's a lot of things just like oh

1645.26 --> 1650.24
this connects that connects and then

1647.299 --> 1652.48
that means something oh really no not

1650.24 --> 1652.48
really

1655.039 --> 1659.48
anyway

1656.84 --> 1662.059
apparently it was a whole thing that he

1659.48 --> 1664.82
kind of started to address Flat Earth

1662.059 --> 1666.9189999999999
more directly with the guys and

1664.82 --> 1669.62
I didn't get through the first half hour

1666.919 --> 1671.659
so I don't know maybe the rest was

1669.62 --> 1673.58
halfway decent

1671.659 --> 1675.8200000000002
if any of you could have sit through all

1673.58 --> 1675.82
that

1679.46 --> 1682.3400000000001
ah I mean working hard to pay the

1681.32 --> 1684.9189999999999
Gateway

1682.34 --> 1685.82
cool send a bit of paper I appreciate

1684.919 --> 1688.22
that

1685.82 --> 1690.9189999999999
and I'm glad that you're doing well

1688.22 --> 1691.7
enough to afford that at least she I'm

1690.919 --> 1696.1000000000001
glad

1691.7 --> 1696.1000000000001
thank you I will check my PayPal

1703.76 --> 1709.72
whoa

1706.039 --> 1709.72
dude a bit

1709.82 --> 1712.6
holy

1713.72 --> 1718.0
wait who is that is that you

1720.26 --> 1723.62
I don't want to say the name out a lot

1721.94 --> 1725.419
but I got a pretty big PayPal there

1723.62 --> 1729.399
thank you very much

1725.419 --> 1729.3990000000001
if that was you that's pretty amazing

1730.1 --> 1735.4399999999998
the otherwise did great nonetheless yeah

1731.96 --> 1738.2
Terry 306 no look overall I really like

1735.44 --> 1740.72
David Weiss

1738.2 --> 1744.0800000000002
right I like the joke a bit about his

1740.72 --> 1744.919
dewy nature and all that it's just so I

1744.08 --> 1748.0
can

1744.919 --> 1748.0
manage it

1751.039 --> 1756.08
like there's only like a couple of

1753.74 --> 1758.72
issues I have with him and overall I

1756.08 --> 1761.6589999999999
think he's great and he he's doing a lot

1758.72 --> 1763.94
of connecting right he's reaching out in

1761.659 --> 1766.22
effective ways like he's even gotten on

1763.94 --> 1768.0800000000002
Alex Jones and all that

1766.22 --> 1770.419
I mean can't say the man doesn't make

1768.08 --> 1772.96
any effort he definitely does and I

1770.419 --> 1772.96
respect that

1773.24 --> 1778.159
but when it comes to like mechanical

1775.58 --> 1781.9399999999998
expertise well he would even admit I'm

1778.159 --> 1784.659
not the best guy out there

1781.94 --> 1784.659
so

1789.26 --> 1791.74
right

1802.039 --> 1807.5
no what

1804.799 --> 1809.299
and wouldn't confess he gave him hours

1807.5 --> 1810.799
of evidence

1809.299 --> 1814.1589999999999
laughing

1810.799 --> 1816.1399999999999
and now yeah that makes sense is that

1814.159 --> 1819.22
what happened Terry 306 did you actually

1816.14 --> 1819.22
watch the whole video

1829.279 --> 1836.25
okay

1831.33 --> 1836.25
[Music]

1851.24 --> 1854.559
of course okay

1884.899 --> 1887.0189999999998
thank you

1912.22 --> 1917.919
it really reminds me of the turtle from

1915.08 --> 1917.9189999999999
The NeverEnding Story

1956.24 --> 1960.76
hold on I'm dressing something here

2011.86 --> 2016.1399999999999
sorry I'm getting some trouble here

2017.5 --> 2022.44
pasting and Skype can be such a pain in

2020.08 --> 2022.4399999999998
the ass

2029.76 --> 2032.93
[Music]

2043.96 --> 2048.399
oh God

2045.94 --> 2050.98
Neil is refusing to read my message

2048.399 --> 2053.6189999999997
apparently I insulted him somehow

2050.98 --> 2056.7400000000002
because of some troll

2053.619 --> 2059.56
that was referencing my show when it was

2056.74 --> 2061.899
[ __ ] talking a while ago

2059.56 --> 2064.72
and like said he was kind of stupid or

2061.899 --> 2066.2799999999997
something but he is sometimes you know

2064.72 --> 2068.5
it's just

2066.28 --> 2072.0600000000004
trying to explain to him look I still

2068.5 --> 2072.06
really appreciate you don't

2072.52 --> 2079.079
don't be demoralized by that

2075.46 --> 2079.079
yeah anyway

2080.26 --> 2082.5
foreign

2085.98 --> 2092.32
ER guy is just in it for his Fanboys and

2090.22 --> 2095.379
squirt money well yeah that seems like

2092.32 --> 2097.7200000000003
it he has a lot of fans

2095.379 --> 2099.7599999999998
it's almost like a cult they don't

2097.72 --> 2101.74
actually understand what the [ __ ] he's

2099.76 --> 2104.38
talking about they just really like the

2101.74 --> 2106.839
Techno Babble and they like his the act

2104.38 --> 2108.88
of his confidence like he really knows

2106.839 --> 2111.7599999999998
it oh and it's like holding things back

2108.88 --> 2114.7000000000003
like he likes that

2111.76 --> 2118.48
it's all a bluff

2114.7 --> 2121.14
yes he's trying to figure things out

2118.48 --> 2121.14
but

2121.72 --> 2129.06
it's just a lot of it's just reification

2124.48 --> 2129.06
it's just jumping to conclusions

2130.0 --> 2134.76
because of similarities and all that

2132.46 --> 2137.7400000000002
pattern similarities this is just

2134.76 --> 2142.0200000000004
magical thinking

2137.74 --> 2142.02
and in physics that's not a good thing

2145.839 --> 2150.46
okay flip flap

2147.88 --> 2153.06
Aaron Armstrong behave

2150.46 --> 2153.06
uh

2163.78 --> 2168.76
yeah Tara 306 right that's roughly

2166.78 --> 2171.3590000000004
what's going on hey slo-mo moon buggy

2168.76 --> 2171.3590000000004
good to see you

2175.3 --> 2181.96
all right so here's the thing I don't

2178.54 --> 2184.92
mind Ken wheeler being popular

2181.96 --> 2188.02
what I do mind is everybody

2184.92 --> 2189.64
thinking suddenly because of him they

2188.02 --> 2190.9
know what they're talking about trying

2189.64 --> 2192.7
to Echo

2190.9 --> 2195.46
structures that he's been talking about

2192.7 --> 2197.02
and thinking like they suddenly know it

2195.46 --> 2199.54
right

2197.02 --> 2202.66
because those people actually get in the

2199.54 --> 2205.48
way of raw developments

2202.66 --> 2207.16
like what I try to do constantly like

2205.48 --> 2210.28
what I was talking about yesterday like

2207.16 --> 2213.339
just out of nowhere opening up this Gap

2210.28 --> 2215.079
like yeah everybody assumes this but

2213.339 --> 2218.2
what if it isn't

2215.079 --> 2219.88
right now if you already know everything

2218.2 --> 2222.7599999999998
you're going to be like oh you're just

2219.88 --> 2225.82
wasting your time right that's what's

2222.76 --> 2227.619
gonna be conjured out of that

2225.82 --> 2231.4
out of that sort of behavior out of

2227.619 --> 2233.5
techno babblers like that people

2231.4 --> 2236.38
in their minds can go back to sleep

2233.5 --> 2239.579
somebody knows it all it's it's the

2236.38 --> 2243.54
whole societal intellectual dependency

2239.579 --> 2243.54
formula all over again

2249.88 --> 2255.82
you don't have to go I'm just I gave you

2252.579 --> 2258.76
a preemptive warning Aaron Armstrong I

2255.82 --> 2261.599
know how you get sometimes

2258.76 --> 2261.599
that's all

2269.859 --> 2274.0
there's no glamoring coming out and

2272.079 --> 2277.8390000000004
saying you're a flat earther

2274.0 --> 2279.339
well there isn't some instances right I

2277.839 --> 2281.859
mean

2279.339 --> 2284.32
when everybody knows like this situation

2281.859 --> 2286.839
is out of control you might be surprised

2284.32 --> 2288.82
that they'd be more willing to actually

2286.839 --> 2291.2799999999997
listen to a flat earther

2288.82 --> 2292.42
right when everything goes into complete

2291.28 --> 2296.44
chaos

2292.42 --> 2299.32
they will try to seek order desperately

2296.44 --> 2302.44
and they will like

2299.32 --> 2305.26
some of those automated programmed

2302.44 --> 2307.96
defenses to to shame us and put it at

2305.26 --> 2310.0600000000004
the distance will be diminished

2307.96 --> 2311.02
so they'd be like oh okay now we'll

2310.06 --> 2313.7799999999997
listen

2311.02 --> 2316.72
because now it's really chaos

2313.78 --> 2319.119
like the formula of pretense oh it's

2316.72 --> 2321.52
under control doesn't work anymore

2319.119 --> 2323.92
that's when people in general are more

2321.52 --> 2326.079
inclined to actually listen to somebody

2323.92 --> 2328.3
that thinks outside of the box is what

2326.079 --> 2330.52
it used to be called

2328.3 --> 2333.0600000000004
so I'm a synonymous with a flat earther

2330.52 --> 2333.06
now but

2340.48 --> 2344.579
never bargained for popularity

2352.18 --> 2358.18
right well when it comes to popularity

2354.76 --> 2361.599
you know I like popularity in a way I

2358.18 --> 2363.7
like being popular why because people

2361.599 --> 2365.7400000000002
will listen to you it's an opportunity

2363.7 --> 2368.7599999999998
to actually try to hand them something

2365.74 --> 2371.3799999999997
that will help improve them right

2368.76 --> 2374.98
unfortunately though for most people

2371.38 --> 2379.2400000000002
being popular just means

2374.98 --> 2380.7400000000002
you become enablers for some kind of bad

2379.24 --> 2383.2599999999998
behavior

2380.74 --> 2385.5989999999997
for them

2383.26 --> 2387.88
then they even give you money for it or

2385.599 --> 2391.06
enabling them for giving them a

2387.88 --> 2393.1600000000003
comforting feeling that they can like do

2391.06 --> 2395.68
some micro sin

2393.16 --> 2400.3199999999997
some stupid things I'm not looking into

2395.68 --> 2400.3199999999997
it some believing you're all-powerful

2400.359 --> 2407.14
and if you enable that as some Guru on

2403.66 --> 2410.3799999999997
the Internet or something then people

2407.14 --> 2413.2599999999998
will like support you for that they will

2410.38 --> 2417.599
actually almost worship you for that or

2413.26 --> 2417.599
at helping them enable their sin

2418.54 --> 2423.7
that's the the big

2420.88 --> 2426.76
downside it's the corruption side of

2423.7 --> 2429.7799999999997
popularity that you become enablers of

2426.76 --> 2429.78
other people's sins

2429.819 --> 2434.68
that can happen

2432.16 --> 2436.96
right especially if you want to hold on

2434.68 --> 2439.5989999999997
to those moments where you are naturally

2436.96 --> 2441.46
popular because of the momentum

2439.599 --> 2443.7400000000002
whatever's going on

2441.46 --> 2446.2
if you didn't want to hang on to that oh

2443.74 --> 2450.2799999999997
everybody like me yeah then you will

2446.2 --> 2452.4399999999996
very likely become a sin enabler

2450.28 --> 2456.0400000000004
and maintain your popularity like that

2452.44 --> 2459.4
that's how it usually happens

2456.04 --> 2461.68
that's how people get into that position

2459.4 --> 2464.56
they were tempted

2461.68 --> 2468.5989999999997
by the fame

2464.56 --> 2470.98
that want to maintain it not only works

2468.599 --> 2473.079
like if you want it constantly then

2470.98 --> 2476.02
you're gonna have to like Spellbound

2473.079 --> 2479.76
people spell bind people through their

2476.02 --> 2479.7599999999998
sins and become their sin enabler

2501.099 --> 2506.339
Empire State asteroid early what

2512.26 --> 2518.3190000000004
are you hinting at people falling for a

2515.859 --> 2519.52
shitty Guru like sad Guru

2518.319 --> 2523.66
yeah

2519.52 --> 2526.3
well it's the same mechanism right

2523.66 --> 2527.7999999999997
all of that all of it is always sin

2526.3 --> 2530.7000000000003
enablers

2527.8 --> 2530.7000000000003
you have a sin

2532.54 --> 2535.92
you're going to be enabled

2543.4 --> 2550.02
right I mean it it now things get

2546.64 --> 2553.839
complicated okay let's go into like more

2550.02 --> 2556.38
difficult gray area zone

2553.839 --> 2560.5
with free speech out there for example

2556.38 --> 2562.9
let's say like you are

2560.5 --> 2564.579
white supremacist right and they are

2562.9 --> 2567.4
there they're people that actually

2564.579 --> 2570.94
started bleeding that that's really

2567.4 --> 2573.819
stupid in my opinion right but yeah they

2570.94 --> 2577.599
want to just be able to talk like that

2573.819 --> 2580.599
in my opinion it's sort of [ __ ] talking

2577.599 --> 2582.52
and they want to normalize that

2580.599 --> 2586.42
right and then they have that has a

2582.52 --> 2588.52
polarizing effect splits people up

2586.42 --> 2590.6800000000003
well

2588.52 --> 2594.94
they just want

2590.68 --> 2598.2999999999997
that sin and it is a sin to be enabled

2594.94 --> 2600.339
they just want to [ __ ] talk their thing

2598.3 --> 2601.9
even though it's disruptive and it is a

2600.339 --> 2604.42
sin right it

2601.9 --> 2606.339
this is not about whether they that

2604.42 --> 2609.16
should exist or not it's just like

2606.339 --> 2611.98
everybody has weird issues

2609.16 --> 2615.7
with things and some people are like

2611.98 --> 2617.56
really into oh like oh white people

2615.7 --> 2621.4199999999996
right and the same goes by the way for

2617.56 --> 2623.2
some black people and dude like black

2621.42 --> 2627.28
supremacists

2623.2 --> 2629.319
are like enabled like all hell like holy

2627.28 --> 2632.26
[ __ ] dude they literally get like money

2629.319 --> 2634.72
thrown at them sometimes that's how much

2632.26 --> 2636.099
people want to enable them to do that to

2634.72 --> 2638.7
do that sin

2636.099 --> 2638.7000000000003
you see

2640.359 --> 2646.9
but it's all sin enabling

2644.38 --> 2650.319
I mean you don't have to do that if you

2646.9 --> 2652.599
have like genuine theories about white

2650.319 --> 2655.359
supremacy

2652.599 --> 2658.06
then actually prove it

2655.359 --> 2660.22
and be honest yeah because that's where

2658.06 --> 2663.46
the problem goes it always turns into

2660.22 --> 2666.04
like oh yeah we we think we're superior

2663.46 --> 2669.819
but we can't actually face the parts in

2666.04 --> 2671.8
which we're not Superior ah compared to

2669.819 --> 2674.7
others other

2671.8 --> 2674.7000000000003
races

2676.66 --> 2681.5789999999997
and that's the issue and that's when it

2679.3 --> 2684.76
becomes a sin it's like oh we're better

2681.579 --> 2687.2200000000003
we're covering up our weakness we're

2684.76 --> 2689.079
pretending like we don't have them

2687.22 --> 2692.6189999999997
that's the sin

2689.079 --> 2695.1600000000003
if you're going to claim superiority

2692.619 --> 2695.1600000000003
see

2696.579 --> 2700.1800000000003
a Nathan Oakley 1980 good to see you

2698.92 --> 2702.48
hope there's going to be a live show

2700.18 --> 2702.48
today

2706.06 --> 2709.96
hey Dan Winfield also by the way good to

2708.339 --> 2711.87
see you

2709.96 --> 2715.449
it's fun having you around again

2711.87 --> 2715.449
[Music]

2720.76 --> 2728.46
[Music]

2724.72 --> 2728.4599999999996
hello tree Bob

2740.35 --> 2743.5099999999998
[Music]

2745.96 --> 2753.7
right so look let's just move this to a

2750.819 --> 2755.859
more personal ground right away from

2753.7 --> 2757.359
that silly example of white supremacy

2755.859 --> 2759.96
and black Supremacy

2757.359 --> 2762.22
let's go to Flat Earth yeah because

2759.96 --> 2764.8
there's sins

2762.22 --> 2767.5
that flat earthers can

2764.8 --> 2770.1400000000003
actually engage with

2767.5 --> 2773.02
doing that and that is

2770.14 --> 2775.5989999999997
disrupting people's lives like people

2773.02 --> 2776.98
that aren't actually that don't want to

2775.599 --> 2779.92
know about it

2776.98 --> 2783.099
especially if they're young

2779.92 --> 2785.6800000000003
and then you push it on them

2783.099 --> 2787.3
that's the sin you're disrupting their

2785.68 --> 2789.16
lives when you do that you want to do

2787.3 --> 2791.619
you want to force it

2789.16 --> 2794.16
you want to force your way of thinking

2791.619 --> 2794.1600000000003
onto another

2794.5 --> 2797.26
right

2795.7 --> 2799.4199999999996
that's a sin

2797.26 --> 2801.4
if that's what you're fighting for for

2799.42 --> 2803.619
like the right to Flat smack

2801.4 --> 2806.02
unconditionally to just walk into places

2803.619 --> 2809.02
and start talking about Flat Earth

2806.02 --> 2812.859
that's a sin you're looking for somebody

2809.02 --> 2815.14
that will enable that sin you see

2812.859 --> 2816.7599999999998
now if you don't do that but you do it

2815.14 --> 2819.8799999999997
differently you do it

2816.76 --> 2822.1600000000003
like an open book like hey

2819.88 --> 2824.6400000000003
I'm about flatter if you want to know

2822.16 --> 2827.2599999999998
about it I can tell you

2824.64 --> 2830.14
but be careful you might hear things

2827.26 --> 2831.2200000000003
that'll shock you or that you will not

2830.14 --> 2833.5
like

2831.22 --> 2835.48
but I will be honest

2833.5 --> 2836.98
you just tell me when to stop and I'll

2835.48 --> 2839.02
stop

2836.98 --> 2841.0
right now then

2839.02 --> 2843.7599999999998
it isn't a sin

2841.0 --> 2847.14
right people can do that they can do

2843.76 --> 2847.1400000000003
that pretty much everywhere

2848.14 --> 2853.54
right people don't complain about those

2851.14 --> 2856.359
types of people doing that no people

2853.54 --> 2860.8
complain about oh I'm gonna go in here

2856.359 --> 2862.9
uh it's a flat you stupid idiots

2860.8 --> 2865.2400000000002
you've been lied to all your life

2862.9 --> 2867.839
they're all Psychopaths to drink your

2865.24 --> 2870.7
blood and uh

2867.839 --> 2874.2999999999997
that said yeah that's

2870.7 --> 2876.3999999999996
that's what people complain about

2874.3 --> 2879.6400000000003
it's what used to be kind of designated

2876.4 --> 2882.579
as the kooky conspiracy theorist

2879.64 --> 2885.4
right but it's really disruptive when

2882.579 --> 2888.1600000000003
it's displayed in popular culture and

2885.4 --> 2890.14
movies and all that it's always kind of

2888.16 --> 2893.14
innocent right it's like oh the

2890.14 --> 2894.94
blabbering weirdo in in a situation and

2893.14 --> 2897.5789999999997
they're kind of off a lot of the times

2894.94 --> 2899.859
but sometimes they might be have just

2897.579 --> 2902.2000000000003
that piece of information that might

2899.859 --> 2903.64
help but they're always often a kind of

2902.2 --> 2905.5
harmless right

2903.64 --> 2908.2799999999997
well in reality

2905.5 --> 2908.28
is different

2909.339 --> 2915.359
usually people that are kooky tend to be

2912.46 --> 2915.359
very pushy

2918.4 --> 2924.04
but there are plenty of people around

2921.22 --> 2926.4399999999996
you wouldn't really notice that do know

2924.04 --> 2928.18
about Flat Earth in detail and they just

2926.44 --> 2931.54
know how to keep it to themselves

2928.18 --> 2933.7799999999997
completely until you ask if you dare ask

2931.54 --> 2933.7799999999997
them

2934.48 --> 2939.52
sounds like Nathan Thompson yeah he's a

2936.46 --> 2941.619
great example and he that he sins he

2939.52 --> 2945.7599999999998
pushes his [ __ ] on people

2941.619 --> 2948.9
right now of course if you're dealing

2945.76 --> 2951.88
with confirmed

2948.9 --> 2953.559
anti-flat earthers right

2951.88 --> 2958.359
then they have absolutely no problem

2953.559 --> 2960.6600000000003
with it suddenly it gets a journalistic

2958.359 --> 2964.0589999999997
how do you call that yeah a journalist

2960.66 --> 2966.46
style confrontation effect right because

2964.059 --> 2968.6800000000003
they are sinners like they're Liars

2966.46 --> 2971.68
they're really lying

2968.68 --> 2974.5589999999997
they avoid answering questions that

2971.68 --> 2977.6189999999997
undermine their entire Heritage of

2974.559 --> 2979.7200000000003
thinking yeah then I'm like oh yeah get

2977.619 --> 2981.04
in their face right that's those are

2979.72 --> 2983.319
some of the moments with Nathan Thompson

2981.04 --> 2985.359
and I'm like yeah bro this is exactly

2983.319 --> 2988.54
where it's useful

2985.359 --> 2990.819
but Jen just stick to the anti-flater

2988.54 --> 2993.2799999999997
there's in doing it like that general

2990.819 --> 2997.48
public don't do it like that

2993.28 --> 2999.8190000000004
be very subtle warn them like you might

2997.48 --> 3003.02
learn things

2999.819 --> 3006.119
that'll that could if you're not careful

3003.02 --> 3008.22
like like

3006.119 --> 3010.1400000000003
make things go wrong in your life like

3008.22 --> 3012.48
people if you just start talking about

3010.14 --> 3014.94
this people might actually like

3012.48 --> 3018.0
disconnect from you

3014.94 --> 3021.26
like even like potentially your wife or

3018.0 --> 3021.26
something right be careful

3024.42 --> 3028.619
but with anti-flatter there's a whole

3026.52 --> 3031.02
different story right that's when like

3028.619 --> 3033.599
the more Ambush journalism suddenly

3031.02 --> 3036.059
becomes more balanced it's not a sin

3033.599 --> 3038.94
because you're doing it with people that

3036.059 --> 3041.099
are obviously sinning they're just lying

3038.94 --> 3044.52
and making up [ __ ]

3041.099 --> 3048.059
and getting money for it in popularity

3044.52 --> 3049.92
they are sin enablers

3048.059 --> 3054.559
all right see

3049.92 --> 3054.559
the the spirit mechanics behind it all

3054.839 --> 3058.859
and if you look at it like this then

3057.18 --> 3063.02
suddenly

3058.859 --> 3063.02
everything becomes a lot more natural

3063.24 --> 3069.9599999999996
you will be able to identify why you or

3067.02 --> 3071.579
others might be or might not be offended

3069.96 --> 3074.16
by something

3071.579 --> 3076.26
right it's the sin the sin is the thing

3074.16 --> 3079.2
that triggers that you have to

3076.26 --> 3081.2400000000002
understand how it is a sin and it's

3079.2 --> 3083.52
probably a micro sin right it's it's not

3081.24 --> 3086.7799999999997
like oh you kill somebody or something

3083.52 --> 3086.78
no but it is

3087.3 --> 3092.1600000000003
like sin enabling

3089.819 --> 3096.44
is a thing

3092.16 --> 3096.44
it's like a market of the spirit

3101.66 --> 3108.54
moves a closet no Jason Brown no no no

3104.819 --> 3111.42
no no he is anti-flatter

3108.54 --> 3114.24
although he won't you say he does like

3111.42 --> 3116.7000000000003
letter but he is fundamentalist

3114.24 --> 3121.2799999999997
anti-flat earther

3116.7 --> 3121.2799999999997
it's just kind of laid back about it

3122.04 --> 3127.22
it is not closet heavy

3124.74 --> 3127.22
see

3146.16 --> 3151.0789999999997
let's see I think I skipped a lot was

3148.98 --> 3152.76
that what said

3151.079 --> 3155.2200000000003
and

3152.76 --> 3158.6400000000003
rambling on Non-Stop for like an hour

3155.22 --> 3161.839
[Music]

3158.64 --> 3161.839
which is a good thing

3162.0 --> 3167.359
I gotta read back

3163.74 --> 3167.359
if you've seen Dave Murphy's return

3169.74 --> 3175.4399999999996
yeah Tony with him I was gonna watch the

3172.98 --> 3178.8
Dave Murphy video I did notice it but

3175.44 --> 3180.9
then it just I got too many things to

3178.8 --> 3183.3590000000004
watch it it didn't get to it

3180.9 --> 3185.88
you say it's good okay it might take a

3183.359 --> 3190.46
look afterward

3185.88 --> 3190.46
can we lose your closet Flair no

3191.579 --> 3194.599
no he's not

3212.94 --> 3218.359
yes he is what are you you're talking

3216.059 --> 3218.3590000000004
about

3220.68 --> 3224.04
no

3222.359 --> 3225.96
no I don't think that's what would

3224.04 --> 3228.0589999999997
happen

3225.96 --> 3230.7
like if he's gonna be

3228.059 --> 3233.099
actually about Flat Earth this is what's

3230.7 --> 3234.8999999999996
gonna happen he's gonna get a whole

3233.099 --> 3236.52
bunch of people after him it's gonna

3234.9 --> 3239.28
scare him and then he's gonna stop

3236.52 --> 3242.04
talking about Flat Earth again

3239.28 --> 3243.48
and go back to the old formula

3242.04 --> 3246.48
because he's a wizard he's a

3243.48 --> 3249.96
technobabler he's a sin enabler he needs

3246.48 --> 3251.7
to uphold that frequency or he'll lose

3249.96 --> 3255.44
his flock

3251.7 --> 3255.4399999999996
it's not going to become a flatter

3268.559 --> 3272.52
I mean he's not going to become an

3270.54 --> 3274.859
anti-flat earther if that's what you're

3272.52 --> 3278.28
wondering that's not what I said

3274.859 --> 3280.2599999999998
right he's not gonna start like opposing

3278.28 --> 3282.299
every argument and start entertaining

3280.26 --> 3285.1800000000003
[ __ ] just to not be a flat earther

3282.299 --> 3288.5
he's not going to certainly be a flat

3285.18 --> 3288.5
earther he's just gonna

3291.619 --> 3296.2400000000002
try to stake just not talk about it

3301.98 --> 3308.46
yeah the other Android look it just

3305.4 --> 3311.1600000000003
is it's a trolls and if they're just if

3308.46 --> 3314.28
you're gonna insert any form of at home

3311.16 --> 3317.16
that is just obvious

3314.28 --> 3319.98
even in the name you're gone just have a

3317.16 --> 3322.6189999999997
proper name be a person

3319.98 --> 3326.04
like have a lasting identity

3322.619 --> 3328.5
representation somehow

3326.04 --> 3330.66
something cohesive and you and you can

3328.5 --> 3334.799
have that

3330.66 --> 3337.44
people that think that like a name

3334.799 --> 3340.2599999999998
of a YouTube account is like the clothes

3337.44 --> 3342.54
you put on for the day like a

3340.26 --> 3346.26
fashionable woman

3342.54 --> 3348.72
I'm sorry get the [ __ ] out

3346.26 --> 3351.1400000000003
be a consistent person or just get the

3348.72 --> 3351.14
[ __ ] out

3371.04 --> 3376.619
he literally said okay okay hmm that's

3374.16 --> 3378.839
interesting rig back

3376.619 --> 3380.579
all right well maybe then he is a

3378.839 --> 3383.64
closeted flat earther

3380.579 --> 3385.8590000000004
if he's actually been saying that but

3383.64 --> 3388.319
what I said he's not gonna get out of

3385.859 --> 3390.0589999999997
that closet

3388.319 --> 3392.16
right he might stick his arm out

3390.059 --> 3395.3390000000004
sometimes

3392.16 --> 3397.0789999999997
do some hand bro handshaking or

3395.339 --> 3400.2799999999997
something with flat Earth but he's not

3397.079 --> 3400.28
gonna come out of the closet

3415.35 --> 3418.44
[Music]

3420.54 --> 3423.5589999999997
all right yeah sorry

3423.78 --> 3428.76
I think I might have been like too

3426.119 --> 3430.38
dismissive at first glance of what you

3428.76 --> 3432.119
said I think I understand now much

3430.38 --> 3434.4
better what you mean when you say closet

3432.119 --> 3436.6800000000003
is flatter it's just not he doesn't

3434.4 --> 3439.92
really what like

3436.68 --> 3444.0
it hasn't actually engaged at Flat Earth

3439.92 --> 3446.52
reasoning you see there's just like some

3444.0 --> 3448.92
things that is just looking at like uh

3446.52 --> 3452.16
he doesn't want to get into it

3448.92 --> 3455.66
right he doesn't want to unravel the

3452.16 --> 3455.66
spells for his audience

3466.4 --> 3472.1600000000003
dielectric plane of inertia oh my God

3477.78 --> 3480.299
I don't know what the hell he's talking

3479.46 --> 3483.18
about

3480.299 --> 3484.859
what the hell what dielectric plane

3483.18 --> 3489.2599999999998
inertia

3484.859 --> 3489.2599999999998
there's a plane of inertia like what

3496.74 --> 3502.74
I mean it seems like he is a bit of a

3500.04 --> 3505.14
bob earther or maybe Bob Arthur is more

3502.74 --> 3507.8999999999996
of a Ken wheeler

3505.14 --> 3510.24
follower like that the dielectric

3507.9 --> 3512.94
nonsense is just relative density

3510.24 --> 3515.339
density it's just that just relative

3512.94 --> 3518.7000000000003
density like that's all there is and oh

3515.339 --> 3521.16
we want to know why yeah that's cute

3518.7 --> 3523.3799999999997
you can't

3521.16 --> 3525.8999999999996
it's not those things it's nothing

3523.38 --> 3529.339
electric because everything electric or

3525.9 --> 3529.339
magnetic is measurable

3529.68 --> 3536.299
has like distinct decrease in power over

3533.88 --> 3536.299
distance

3538.44 --> 3542.52
and

3540.78 --> 3545.1600000000003
yeah

3542.52 --> 3547.559
whatever relative density does

3545.16 --> 3551.3999999999996
it does not have those things those

3547.559 --> 3554.1600000000003
things are not measurably there to cause

3551.4 --> 3556.44
or not cause the relative density

3554.16 --> 3559.98
displacement

3556.44 --> 3562.98
it's just not that done over

3559.98 --> 3564.0
yet they've spent years and years both

3562.98 --> 3565.64
of them

3564.0 --> 3568.38
just

3565.64 --> 3570.1189999999997
rolling it out over and over again like

3568.38 --> 3574.2200000000003
that makes it real

3570.119 --> 3574.2200000000003
it isn't it's not that

3574.319 --> 3581.4
it's over there is

3576.9 --> 3582.1800000000003
no dielectric gravity [ __ ] it isn't

3581.4 --> 3585.44
there

3582.18 --> 3585.44
it's not how it works

3587.28 --> 3593.94
this just density and we don't know why

3590.48 --> 3597.9
in my personal view not that it's really

3593.94 --> 3601.98
relevant to physics it's God God just

3597.9 --> 3604.5
said click and henceforth

3601.98 --> 3605.94
the dents will go down and the less

3604.5 --> 3610.44
dense will go up

3605.94 --> 3613.2000000000003
and that's it like decree this is the

3610.44 --> 3616.38
law now of physics of how this happens

3613.2 --> 3620.0989999999997
in this Physical Realm and that's it

3616.38 --> 3624.319
right and until there is some

3620.099 --> 3624.319
variability of some kind

3624.48 --> 3629.64
like if there is a region up there for

3627.48 --> 3631.7400000000002
example where relative density would be

3629.64 --> 3633.72
neutralized which is kind of a science

3631.74 --> 3636.4199999999996
fiction concept

3633.72 --> 3637.68
I even addressed that like yesterday I

3636.42 --> 3639.599
think

3637.68 --> 3644.2799999999997
they're like meat you're slung or was it

3639.599 --> 3646.8590000000004
two days ago meteors flowing in there

3644.28 --> 3649.02
and yeah they don't

3646.859 --> 3650.94
they're not displaced by relative

3649.02 --> 3654.18
density this equilibrium

3650.94 --> 3657.96
well if that is there then you can start

3654.18 --> 3661.3799999999997
to like okay if it's not Universal

3657.96 --> 3664.02
then how is it working the way it is

3661.38 --> 3667.92
well since

3664.02 --> 3669.42
a relative density neutral zone is just

3667.92 --> 3672.1800000000003
science fiction that I literally

3669.42 --> 3675.0
conjured up as a concept

3672.18 --> 3677.46
there's nothing to go by

3675.0 --> 3680.16
until you actually would find such a

3677.46 --> 3681.9
thing and before that time you shouldn't

3680.16 --> 3683.52
even consider

3681.9 --> 3686.059
such as a

3683.52 --> 3686.059
hold on

3723.359 --> 3727.22
this was 100 flat

3730.319 --> 3735.24
okay Rick back I'm gonna take your word

3733.38 --> 3737.52
on that

3735.24 --> 3742.0389999999998
I I mean I only watched like half an

3737.52 --> 3742.0389999999998
hour and then I just too annoyed

3745.619 --> 3750.02
but I guess I'll try to remember that

3770.039 --> 3774.599
why is down down in

3772.619 --> 3776.1600000000003
is up up

3774.599 --> 3779.9
yeah

3776.16 --> 3779.8999999999996
like why do we have eyes

3782.7 --> 3788.3999999999996
yeah why why yeah you don't get to know

3787.14 --> 3791.4
why

3788.4 --> 3795.299
try to figure it out yeah

3791.4 --> 3798.059
you don't have the right to know why to

3795.299 --> 3801.96
every freaking question

3798.059 --> 3805.079
people are gonna run out of answers

3801.96 --> 3808.68
you're gonna have to deal with that fact

3805.079 --> 3810.539
that we don't know everything

3808.68 --> 3812.8799999999997
and if you think you know everything

3810.539 --> 3815.94
you'll find out very quickly that

3812.88 --> 3819.079
there's a lot more to know

3815.94 --> 3819.079
that always happens

3819.78 --> 3823.559
right

3821.16 --> 3826.14
you're going by the assumption that you

3823.559 --> 3829.7400000000002
can know everything that you can

3826.14 --> 3831.42
complete the knowledge you're fooling

3829.74 --> 3834.0589999999997
yourself

3831.42 --> 3837.1800000000003
always more

3834.059 --> 3840.119
the only way to affirm to yourself that

3837.18 --> 3845.7799999999997
you could know or do know everything is

3840.119 --> 3845.78
By ignoring those things you don't know

3850.859 --> 3853.7599999999998
ah

3862.02 --> 3866.299
it was literally finishing people's ah

3868.68 --> 3872.1189999999997
like to have him on board

3872.28 --> 3875.0
all right

3875.64 --> 3883.319
well look the if if the the tattoo Jabba

3880.079 --> 3886.099
the Hutt wizard if he wants to become a

3883.319 --> 3886.099
flat earther now

3886.26 --> 3891.2400000000002
but it's probably gonna be just like

3888.119 --> 3894.359
Boba Jason or something I mean Bob would

3891.24 --> 3897.0
freaking love that I you know he does he

3894.359 --> 3899.5389999999998
almost worships the guy

3897.0 --> 3899.539
so

3900.78 --> 3904.26
I don't see how things could get any

3903.0 --> 3908.0
worse

3904.26 --> 3912.6800000000003
except well there would be more of a

3908.0 --> 3912.68
reification [ __ ] going down right

3914.46 --> 3920.099
I mean you we all know he is going to

3917.7 --> 3921.66
keep going with dielectric acceleration

3920.099 --> 3925.619
is gravity

3921.66 --> 3928.2599999999998
and The Ether of course at least I don't

3925.619 --> 3931.339
know does he actually think that the

3928.26 --> 3931.3390000000004
light ether is a thing

3932.52 --> 3936.96
I don't know maybe Ken Wheeler's gone

3935.22 --> 3939.839
through a lot of like internal

3936.96 --> 3941.94
development and he actually moved on I

3939.839 --> 3944.18
don't know for sure I haven't followed

3941.94 --> 3944.18
him

3945.559 --> 3952.579
just sometimes get to see what he does

3948.539 --> 3952.579
every now and then that's it

3957.119 --> 3960.5
yes yes what

3967.799 --> 3975.319
check out his holographic magnets what

3971.4 --> 3975.319
what are you talking about tominoid

3983.52 --> 3988.079
what

3986.099 --> 3990.319
what does magnetism have to do with

3988.079 --> 3990.319
light

4014.92 --> 4018.64
Pharaoh cells okay

4019.72 --> 4024.64
yeah I've never heard of that so that's

4022.099 --> 4024.6400000000003
new to me

4028.28 --> 4032.1800000000003
like it doesn't make S like why would

4030.319 --> 4034.2799999999997
you call it a holographic magnet can

4032.18 --> 4036.74
somebody explain that to me

4034.28 --> 4039.559
like what the hell does magnetism have

4036.74 --> 4041.5389999999998
to do with holographics

4039.559 --> 4044.2400000000002
image of light

4041.539 --> 4046.8190000000004
magnet what

4044.24 --> 4050.0
how does that connect

4046.819 --> 4051.92
what is he creating a magnet effect with

4050.0 --> 4053.78
lights he's just shining light in a

4051.92 --> 4056.98
certain way and then something becomes

4053.78 --> 4056.98
magnetic like what the [ __ ]

4061.72 --> 4067.24
light gets bent into toroidal form

4067.94 --> 4070.78
okay

4085.4 --> 4092.7200000000003
so what is the point of that

4089.539 --> 4097.18
sounds like another weird little Gadget

4092.72 --> 4097.179999999999
to be a Wizardry about so

4103.819 --> 4109.219
right it just sounds so typically like

4106.219 --> 4111.5
him dude dude the guy has been into like

4109.219 --> 4115.1
look at my device doing something

4111.5 --> 4117.799
sciency he's always been doing that for

4115.1 --> 4119.6
years years and years every time he

4117.799 --> 4121.159
always says oh look at this new device

4119.6 --> 4123.4400000000005
that I made

4121.159 --> 4126.4
and none of it really proves anything

4123.44 --> 4129.98
it's just like oh look at me being all

4126.4 --> 4132.199
high techie oh this reveals so many

4129.98 --> 4134.0
Mysteries yeah that really don't have a

4132.199 --> 4137.5
point

4134.0 --> 4137.5
doesn't actually prove anything

4140.0 --> 4143.98
yeah man-made devices that's right

4147.98 --> 4152.62
go ahead

4149.779 --> 4152.620000000001
oh guard

4157.58 --> 4159.58
um

4179.96 --> 4187.1
right okay it all sounds like just

4183.679 --> 4188.96
gadgetry to me really I still don't

4187.1 --> 4192.4400000000005
understand what even the point of that

4188.96 --> 4195.279
device is other than looking like ooh

4192.44 --> 4195.2789999999995
signs

4215.12 --> 4217.78
what

4228.14 --> 4233.900000000001
okay am I saying something wrong here or

4230.96 --> 4235.76
I know like there might be some cross

4233.9 --> 4237.62
communication here I don't know who

4235.76 --> 4238.46
you're addressing there's a kumu virus

4237.62 --> 4241.94
being

4238.46 --> 4243.32
an anti-flat earth or delusional idiot I

4241.94 --> 4247.599999999999
don't know if you're talking to him or

4243.32 --> 4247.599999999999
if you're talking to me Tony wake him

4250.699 --> 4256.04
we were still kind of discussing Ken

4253.04 --> 4258.64
wheeler devices so this is getting

4256.04 --> 4258.64
confusing

4268.64 --> 4275.719
no I'm not gonna ban him

4272.0 --> 4278.179
like I'll time him out at best but

4275.719 --> 4281.8
I'd prefer if you guys just kept focused

4278.179 --> 4281.8
on the discussion

4282.98 --> 4287.919999999999
yes Godzilla we know he's an idiot

4290.9 --> 4294.339999999999
oh okay let's go

4300.679 --> 4304.84
right okay that makes sense then

4305.6 --> 4310.34
to Circular reasoning fund you [ __ ]

4308.0 --> 4313.34
yeah but that's what he does

4310.34 --> 4316.3
I mean he does it like every time you

4313.34 --> 4316.3
should know that by now

4335.739 --> 4341.839999999999
doesn't point to the North Pole it

4338.48 --> 4344.62
points to the north direction of a

4341.84 --> 4344.62
magnetic field

4344.9 --> 4349.54
okay

4347.0 --> 4349.54
yeah

4362.14 --> 4370.4800000000005
dude the whole magnetic situation

4365.6 --> 4370.4800000000005
on the Flat Earth is so confusing

4371.96 --> 4377.659
it's kind of why I stay away from that

4374.9 --> 4379.28
okay it is really confusing like oh how

4377.659 --> 4381.5599999999995
is it all possible

4379.28 --> 4383.42
oh look it has to be a disc it's the

4381.56 --> 4386.54
only way it works out like a magnetic

4383.42 --> 4389.36
field blah blah blah yeah no except I've

4386.54 --> 4391.1
reason not very early let's say six

4389.36 --> 4392.839999999999
years ago

4391.1 --> 4395.179
it's even like the flatter talks days

4392.84 --> 4397.28
that like yeah but what

4395.179 --> 4400.82
the polls

4397.28 --> 4404.36
aren't actually just points

4400.82 --> 4408.679
but like an entire direction if it's

4404.36 --> 4411.32
like Old North poled magnets in a row

4408.679 --> 4415.36
would it wouldn't it always just kind of

4411.32 --> 4415.36
point to the average North then

4416.9 --> 4422.5599999999995
why would you assume that it can only be

4420.199 --> 4422.5599999999995
a point

4428.179 --> 4430.659
right

4432.26 --> 4436.900000000001
I mean what would happen if you had like

4434.659 --> 4436.9
a

4436.94 --> 4441.5
a piece of wood and you would stick

4439.52 --> 4442.46
magnets to it and you would all have

4441.5 --> 4446.02
them

4442.46 --> 4446.02
set in the same direction

4446.36 --> 4451.099999999999
on each side

4448.94 --> 4453.379999999999
in opposition well if you're going to

4451.1 --> 4456.26
have like a compass and you hold that in

4453.38 --> 4458.3
between those rows doesn't matter where

4456.26 --> 4459.5
I'm like right in between where you're

4458.3 --> 4461.2390000000005
going to point it's always going to keep

4459.5 --> 4464.26
pointing to the same direction because

4461.239 --> 4464.259999999999
that's where the average

4464.8 --> 4469.6990000000005
magnetism of the north Direction kind

4468.08 --> 4473.0199999999995
will be coming from

4469.699 --> 4473.0199999999995
in my suspicion

4479.42 --> 4484.4
right

4481.94 --> 4486.0199999999995
so yeah a whole magnetic situation is

4484.4 --> 4488.839999999999
still very fuzzy I'm much more

4486.02 --> 4491.540000000001
interested in just the euclidean nature

4488.84 --> 4494.0
of it all like the actual scans how does

4491.54 --> 4496.46
it all actually fit

4494.0 --> 4499.82
in the euclidean sets

4496.46 --> 4501.92
I don't think it's a disc

4499.82 --> 4504.44
ussing doesn't fit

4501.92 --> 4506.2390000000005
done deal like after that point it

4504.44 --> 4508.82
doesn't matter anymore like oh it has to

4506.239 --> 4511.218999999999
be a point because magnetically it works

4508.82 --> 4515.5
out yeah but it's not euclidean so it

4511.219 --> 4515.5
isn't actually that can't be

4519.56 --> 4525.6990000000005
all right Tara 306 thanks for popping by

4522.98 --> 4525.699
have a good lunch

4525.73 --> 4528.199

remember Mark Smiler that Nazi man sent

4585.14 --> 4588.52
me a whole bunch of magnets

4589.46 --> 4593.62
I love it

4590.78 --> 4593.62
good stuff

4598.76 --> 4602.92
get this magnetic wand going

4604.96 --> 4609.159
yeah these things are so strong

4619.76 --> 4622.820000000001
yeah

4621.199 --> 4625.599999999999
oh

4622.82 --> 4625.599999999999
so

4628.58 --> 4634.34
we

4631.17 --> 4634.34

4635.42 --> 4637.4800000000005
um

4638.62 --> 4641.699
[Music]

4664.34 --> 4671.4400000000005
yeah why am I offended

4667.4 --> 4676.04
get your own name okay

4671.44 --> 4678.4
get your own name you can't have mine

4676.04 --> 4678.4
here

4679.94 --> 4683.739
yeah funny isn't it we

4683.78 --> 4688.719
It's Magic it's magical

4692.0 --> 4695.159
[Music]

4706.54 --> 4712.0
get it even sillier

4709.46 --> 4712.0
see

4712.58 --> 4716.44
ah damn it come on

4720.8 --> 4724.719
let's see if I can do it like that come

4722.54 --> 4724.719
on

4727.34 --> 4730.58
oh yeah

4728.78 --> 4734.84
okay that's not exactly what I was

4730.58 --> 4734.84
aiming for but yay

4737.96 --> 4743.36
come on

4740.48 --> 4748.12
ah doesn't want to do it

4743.36 --> 4748.12
maybe that does it work does it worked

4752.6 --> 4756.1
this could go horribly wrong

4762.5 --> 4766.179
I'm a magician

4769.82 --> 4776.98
yeah just for the record like these are

4772.94 --> 4776.98
all flat little magnets see

4778.34 --> 4781.0
so funny

4781.76 --> 4786.9400000000005
new toy yeah new toy I got like two

4784.34 --> 4786.9400000000005
years ago

4788.36 --> 4793.099999999999
from a crazy person that sent it to me

4791.239 --> 4795.62
because he was convinced that I had

4793.1 --> 4797.120000000001
chips in my brain

4795.62 --> 4799.64
serious

4797.12 --> 4801.38
the guy was complete nut case he sent me

4799.64 --> 4803.780000000001
the magnets because he thought he was

4801.38 --> 4805.1
going to prove to me that I had chips

4803.78 --> 4807.82
inside of me

4805.1 --> 4807.820000000001
it's

4808.219 --> 4813.34
it's not happening just kidding

4836.48 --> 4843.86
yeah but it is fun it's like this is my

4841.699 --> 4845.62
ghost detector

4843.86 --> 4847.88
[Music]

4845.62 --> 4850.659
you know when there's a ghost when it

4847.88 --> 4850.659000000001
suddenly goes oh

4854.84 --> 4857.5
yes

4861.08 --> 4866.719
silly

4862.94 --> 4868.58
oh man these magnets are like brittle

4866.719 --> 4872.7390000000005
this is like parts that where it's

4868.58 --> 4872.739
really getting chipped away huh

4893.62 --> 4901.239
redactyl Airways ha

4897.8 --> 4901.2390000000005
now that's a funny name

4913.82 --> 4920.5599999999995
do you want a 420 science show what

4921.739 --> 4926.419999999999
really

4923.719 --> 4929.6
you want some Stoner show talking about

4926.42 --> 4932.26
science at kumu virus why am I not

4929.6 --> 4932.26
surprised

4945.679 --> 4949.58
right

4947.0 --> 4951.86
you know it does

4949.58 --> 4953.78
this thing like reminds me of like a

4951.86 --> 4955.82
building what is it like the Taipei

4953.78 --> 4958.58
Tower or something or which one was it

4955.82 --> 4960.98
there's this see the shape

4958.58 --> 4964.159
it reminds me of one of these super tall

4960.98 --> 4966.08
buildings I think it's like in Dubai or

4964.159 --> 4967.94
something

4966.08 --> 4970.36
does anybody know which building I'm

4967.94 --> 4970.36
talking about

4985.06 --> 4988.820000000001
Khalifa what

4987.199 --> 4990.4
is that

4988.82 --> 5003.29
name of a building

4990.4 --> 5003.29
[Music]

5005.44 --> 5008.099999999999
oh

5022.659 --> 5027.239
huh

5024.04 --> 5027.239
that's hilarious

5027.34 --> 5031.32
let me get all because yeah

5033.219 --> 5037.139
doesn't really want to sit straight

5034.719 --> 5037.139
though

5038.86 --> 5043.32
pouring

5040.78 --> 5043.32
oink

5047.63 --> 5050.81
[Music]

5052.02 --> 5055.9800000000005
ooh spiritual Sanctus

5056.5 --> 5059.5
magnetos

5061.38 --> 5065.76
man I got into a goofy mood

5073.91 --> 5078.639
[Music]

5075.76 --> 5081.54
uh yeah right it was the building cool

5078.639 --> 5081.54
let me look that up

5082.78 --> 5086.699
I was right about the Dubai thing

5092.95 --> 5097.78
[Music]

5094.78 --> 5100.179
yeah that's the one

5097.78 --> 5103.48
that's the one Jesus Christ that

5100.179 --> 5108.4800000000005
building is so insanely large

5103.48 --> 5108.48
it's like why it's it's like too big

5110.92 --> 5116.52
but yeah it reminds me a lot about that

5113.62 --> 5116.5199999999995
shape of it

5127.62 --> 5133.38
goofy mood is not allowed how dare you

5130.719 --> 5133.38
yep

5142.42 --> 5148.36
the power of magnetism compels you the

5145.96 --> 5150.46
power of magnetism compels you oh look

5148.36 --> 5153.179
at that

5150.46 --> 5153.179
what the hell

5162.8 --> 5166.26
[Music]

5170.25 --> 5173.369
[Music]

5176.679 --> 5182.34
no thanks aries106 not gonna do that

5187.42 --> 5193.86
still think it's pretty amazing that

5189.4 --> 5193.86
this is something you can do with it

5196.3 --> 5200.379
[Music]

5209.74 --> 5214.26
[Music]

5212.92 --> 5226.319
foreign

5214.26 --> 5226.319
[Music]

5229.96 --> 5235.32
put it back now

5232.239 --> 5235.32
should we have a show

5236.62 --> 5242.219
not just twirling with a helicopter

5239.679 --> 5242.219
magnets

5251.679 --> 5256.2390000000005
okay it work

5253.239 --> 5256.239
no

5256.659 --> 5261.159
no

5258.04 --> 5263.08
I thought maybe I could like click

5261.159 --> 5266.199
stretch it out into

5263.08 --> 5267.34
like this but it's too stuck

5266.199 --> 5269.94
yeah

5267.34 --> 5269.9400000000005
oh

5271.42 --> 5274.96
why did they have to put it into a metal

5273.58 --> 5276.04
box

5274.96 --> 5279.42
just

5276.04 --> 5279.42
why wasn't it just plastic

5279.6 --> 5283.139
hey psych bear

5287.78 --> 5290.88
[Music]

5295.9 --> 5301.48
set up free magnet test outside of jab

5299.08 --> 5303.58
locations

5301.48 --> 5306.159
I'm quite certain

5303.58 --> 5308.34
their police would come to tell me to go

5306.159 --> 5308.339999999999
away

5308.56 --> 5315.639
if I do that

5310.659 --> 5319.179
besides I don't want to be near

5315.639 --> 5321.219
like jab locations like

5319.179 --> 5323.86
right just as much as I wouldn't

5321.219 --> 5325.659
typically like hanging around a

5323.86 --> 5328.54
slaughterhouse

5325.659 --> 5330.58
in the area where they literally killed

5328.54 --> 5334.5
the animals like I don't like hanging

5330.58 --> 5334.5
around those types of places right

5334.96 --> 5340.4800000000005
so I don't really like hanging around

5337.239 --> 5342.82
jab locations like yeah I don't

5340.48 --> 5344.98
want to be in the presence of places

5342.82 --> 5346.299999999999
where people literally get themselves

5344.98 --> 5349.62
killed

5346.3 --> 5349.62
through their own stupidity

5355.78 --> 5359.44
besides I don't even know if there is

5358.12 --> 5362.0199999999995
any

5359.44 --> 5364.379999999999
of all that stuff here in the vaccines

5362.02 --> 5364.38
here

5364.84 --> 5371.08
I mean there is [ __ ] in it but like the

5368.62 --> 5373.599999999999
magnet thing

5371.08 --> 5375.94
I don't I've never heard of like a Dutch

5373.6 --> 5378.820000000001
person said like what the [ __ ] I'm

5375.94 --> 5380.919999999999
magnetic now because of the Jab

5378.82 --> 5383.199
seen some of that in the United States

5380.92 --> 5384.639
and other places

5383.199 --> 5388.659
but

5384.639 --> 5391.179
yeah I'm because I don't think that the

5388.659 --> 5393.28
Jabs are all the same you see I think

5391.179 --> 5395.7390000000005
that

5393.28 --> 5396.94
it's like potentially completely

5395.739 --> 5399.159
different

5396.94 --> 5402.699
with all the batches right there's even

5399.159 --> 5404.739
been like reports how like

5402.699 --> 5406.62
there were three designations like

5404.739 --> 5409.0
placebo

5406.62 --> 5411.46
experimental and lethal

5409.0 --> 5414.58
and how they were like

5411.46 --> 5416.86
designated to certain areas so that if

5414.58 --> 5418.96
people got the jab in certain areas they

5416.86 --> 5421.42
would die and others they might get

5418.96 --> 5423.28
issues and in other places nobody would

5421.42 --> 5424.6
get anything

5423.28 --> 5427.08
right

5424.6 --> 5429.400000000001
so that's already apparently the case

5427.08 --> 5431.58
allegedly I think there's something to

5429.4 --> 5431.58
that

5431.92 --> 5436.719
well if that's the case then how do you

5434.739 --> 5438.638999999999
know that there's just three

5436.719 --> 5440.9800000000005
designations maybe it's just three

5438.639 --> 5445.12
categories in a giant spectrum of like

5440.98 --> 5447.82
oh where let's try everything like

5445.12 --> 5451.5
everything that all the medical people

5447.82 --> 5453.759999999999
and science fiction people and micro

5451.5 --> 5455.32
nanotechnology people

5453.76 --> 5457.96
everything

5455.32 --> 5461.5599999999995
that everybody has ever thought up were

5457.96 --> 5465.96
off right in like the last 100 years

5461.56 --> 5468.6990000000005
Let's test all of it all of it

5465.96 --> 5471.28
everything conceived

5468.699 --> 5474.879999999999
and let's spread it around right so

5471.28 --> 5479.139
there's like a billion people

5474.88 --> 5481.54
with a hundred thousand different tests

5479.139 --> 5483.219
all these substances and all these

5481.54 --> 5486.04
things that has never been tried before

5483.219 --> 5488.26
just Ram it in there see what happens

5486.04 --> 5491.26
right

5488.26 --> 5494.38
because we don't know what is even in

5491.26 --> 5496.96
there like even now

5494.38 --> 5500.28
even now there's no like this is

5496.96 --> 5500.28
literally what is in there

5501.159 --> 5505.239
well why would that be could it be

5502.9 --> 5507.82
because they're not all Universal

5505.239 --> 5510.28
they're all completely different like

5507.82 --> 5513.759999999999
from one company it's just not just oh

5510.28 --> 5515.44
the the vaccine from this company

5513.76 --> 5518.1990000000005
has this and this and this and it no

5515.44 --> 5521.86
they could literally have thousands of

5518.199 --> 5524.259999999999
different matches that are nothing alike

5521.86 --> 5527.44
that they've put out

5524.26 --> 5531.76
during the whole supposed presupposed

5527.44 --> 5534.099999999999
pandemic situation right

5531.76 --> 5536.320000000001
well that would be a good reason why you

5534.1 --> 5538.719
don't actually tell people what's in

5536.32 --> 5540.759999999999
there because it's all different you

5538.719 --> 5542.92
can't

5540.76 --> 5545.9800000000005
with One Singular

5542.92 --> 5548.8
paper then say exactly what is in there

5545.98 --> 5551.44
right you can at best

5548.8 --> 5553.6
give the list of what could potentially

5551.44 --> 5557.86
go wrong right all the

5553.6 --> 5559.84
side effects list now there's those

5557.86 --> 5562.48
but that's all based on could happen

5559.84 --> 5566.08
it's not like this is in here

5562.48 --> 5568.419999999999
why because I think that a lot of these

5566.08 --> 5570.639
vaccines

5568.42 --> 5572.679
even from singular companies there might

5570.639 --> 5574.12
be differences per company too but I

5572.679 --> 5576.159
think that every of those Mega

5574.12 --> 5577.96
corporations that's that unroll does

5576.159 --> 5580.599999999999
have vaccines

5577.96 --> 5582.88
those vaccines are not the same thing

5580.6 --> 5585.34
they're like all kinds of different

5582.88 --> 5587.139
vaccines

5585.34 --> 5589.6
they're not actually very they're

5587.139 --> 5591.76
basically experiments they're all

5589.6 --> 5594.820000000001
different experiments the content's not

5591.76 --> 5597.820000000001
going to be the same per batch from even

5594.82 --> 5599.5599999999995
from singular companies right that would

5597.82 --> 5602.0199999999995
be a good reason not to give you the

5599.56 --> 5604.0
ingredients wouldn't it huh

5602.02 --> 5605.620000000001
because you couldn't because like which

5604.0 --> 5607.54
one are you gonna have

5605.62 --> 5609.82
and if you read a grid it's like yeah oh

5607.54 --> 5612.54
this is super lethal would you then take

5609.82 --> 5612.54
it no

5615.159 --> 5620.339999999999
right it's just an experiment

5620.44 --> 5623.5199999999995
and it is

5624.96 --> 5630.82
seemingly so far voluntary based but

5628.6 --> 5633.76
it's just like it's walking a fine fine

5630.82 --> 5635.86
line right and with all that blustering

5633.76 --> 5637.719
talk like oh Force vaccinate yeah that's

5635.86 --> 5640.179
immediately

5637.719 --> 5641.44
when you invoke like a hardcore

5640.179 --> 5643.54
punishment

5641.44 --> 5646.12
immediately

5643.54 --> 5649.48
like that is so incredibly illegal like

5646.12 --> 5651.82
you can manipulate you can peer pressure

5649.48 --> 5654.82
you you can even take away [ __ ] from

5651.82 --> 5656.86
people if they don't take the facts it's

5654.82 --> 5660.099999999999
brutal it's evil

5656.86 --> 5662.5599999999995
it's counterproductive to society but

5660.1 --> 5666.820000000001
you could legally do that the second you

5662.56 --> 5668.5
say you will take it now don't care what

5666.82 --> 5671.44
you do

5668.5 --> 5673.9
like you're not allowed to flee you must

5671.44 --> 5677.138999999999
take it that's immediately where

5673.9 --> 5679.12
everybody involved in the execution of

5677.139 --> 5682.0
that and the confirmation of that in

5679.12 --> 5684.9
supposed lawful fashion they all get the

5682.0 --> 5684.9
death penalty

5685.179 --> 5687.78
you understand

5690.159 --> 5695.379999999999
that's what happens the second you force

5693.04 --> 5697.78
that's why early on made statements like

5695.38 --> 5700.54
oh oh you you're gonna come to my door

5697.78 --> 5703.3
you are literally going to try to Corner

5700.54 --> 5705.88
me and then force that in me okay well

5703.3 --> 5708.84
if you actually try that then I will

5705.88 --> 5708.84
kill you

5709.0 --> 5713.26
right not wound you in self-defense I

5711.94 --> 5718.659
will literally

5713.26 --> 5721.42
kill you and ensure that you're dead

5718.659 --> 5723.94
yeah that's what will happen if that

5721.42 --> 5726.28
actually starts to unroll here

5723.94 --> 5730.259999999999
actually gonna force it right they can

5726.28 --> 5732.639
bully me they can make it very

5730.26 --> 5735.34
seductible for me to take it or whatever

5732.639 --> 5736.84
they can try second they force it

5735.34 --> 5738.639
they're dead

5736.84 --> 5740.1
the second

5738.639 --> 5745.1990000000005
they're dead

5740.1 --> 5745.1990000000005
immediately signed death warrant

5747.46 --> 5753.04
so keep that in mind as everything goes

5750.219 --> 5755.08
on out there like oh they're going to

5753.04 --> 5757.239
force vaccine people that say oh they're

5755.08 --> 5758.0199999999995
gonna Force fix it they're gonna [ __ ]

5757.239 --> 5760.48
you

5758.02 --> 5764.320000000001
[ __ ] you and shut your [ __ ] mouth

5760.48 --> 5765.759999999999
shut your [ __ ] mouth with your stupid

5764.32 --> 5767.5
hype [ __ ]

5765.76 --> 5769.3
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

5767.5 --> 5771.28
talking about it's all a bluff operation

5769.3 --> 5772.96
by pilingual oh they're forcing it

5771.28 --> 5775.0599999999995
they're forcing it what you're doing is

5772.96 --> 5777.219
you're making the people you're making

5775.06 --> 5779.7390000000005
it harder for them

5777.219 --> 5782.219
to actually see through it because they

5779.739 --> 5785.678999999999
can't force it that's why they made

5782.219 --> 5787.6
incredible effort to set it up the way

5785.679 --> 5789.82
it's working right now because they

5787.6 --> 5792.820000000001
can't force it this the second they

5789.82 --> 5794.739
literally do that they all sign their

5792.82 --> 5797.5599999999995
own death warrant

5794.739 --> 5799.54
irrevocable

5797.56 --> 5804.219
you see

5799.54 --> 5806.56
only Bluff you so don't start spouting

5804.219 --> 5808.54
like a [ __ ] oh they're forcing it to

5806.56 --> 5812.56
force again no they're not they're just

5808.54 --> 5814.42
making it really hard to refuse

5812.56 --> 5816.76
that's what they're trying and it's all

5814.42 --> 5819.54
they can do is the second they force it

5816.76 --> 5819.54
they're dead

5827.06 --> 5830.27
[Music]

5854.5 --> 5858.04
meet you on a dark night

5856.84 --> 5861.52
fine

5858.04 --> 5863.44
I'll do it in a dark night

5861.52 --> 5865.06
I don't care when they're gonna come I

5863.44 --> 5868.78
don't care if they're doing it in the

5865.06 --> 5872.320000000001
middle of the night when I'm sleeping

5868.78 --> 5875.619
if that's what's gonna going to go down

5872.32 --> 5877.9
then I will kill the ones that are doing

5875.619 --> 5880.96
that to me

5877.9 --> 5884.08
not just like oh shoot first ask

5880.96 --> 5887.5
questions later not that I have a gun

5884.08 --> 5890.219
that any of you know of anyway

5887.5 --> 5890.219
but

5890.26 --> 5893.92
I will inquire first it's like is this

5892.42 --> 5897.1
what you're here to do because I will

5893.92 --> 5899.26
not take it go away now if you try to

5897.1 --> 5903.119000000001
physically force it on me I will defend

5899.26 --> 5903.119000000001
myself with lethal Force

5903.82 --> 5909.04
I will

5905.38 --> 5913.96
and if I die in the process then so be

5909.04 --> 5917.38
it I will defend with lethal Force

5913.96 --> 5920.7390000000005
if I have to die then I'll die

5917.38 --> 5924.34
on record having defended my life

5920.739 --> 5926.138999999999
against a lethal attack

5924.34 --> 5928.719
so be it

5926.139 --> 5931.3

I don't have to be super gross about it

6219.42 --> 6225.719
or excessive yeah you know why because

6223.08 --> 6229.139
I'm not actually insecure

6225.719 --> 6232.679
I don't have to armor myself with

6229.139 --> 6236.219
violence overtly because I'm too afraid

6232.679 --> 6237.78
to actually be less

6236.219 --> 6242.1
and more

6237.78 --> 6246.54
simple and honest to a person no I see

6242.1 --> 6249.84
it violence is an emergency Clause it's

6246.54 --> 6255.139
an option I have inside of me

6249.84 --> 6255.139
and I well pretty much never use it

6255.3 --> 6262.6990000000005
but I know it's there I had it tested

that's not my style I'm psychological

6391.26 --> 6396.96
[Music]

6394.32 --> 6398.699
but yeah I don't really connect up to a

6396.96 --> 6400.92
lot of people

6398.699 --> 6404.299999999999
because

6400.92 --> 6404.3
they're not really

6405.119 --> 6411.78
yeah I can't really do anything with him

6409.199 --> 6415.699
other than superficial stuff that will

6411.78 --> 6415.699
not make me feel good afterward

6420.719 --> 6426.84
it's not the right time for it and it

6423.84 --> 6430.5
will probably happen again

6426.84 --> 6432.719
it's not like I've never ever went out

6430.5 --> 6434.58
and socialized I mean I did meet my

6432.719 --> 6437.76
ex-girlfriend that way

6434.58 --> 6442.08
I do actually do that it just requires

6437.76 --> 6444.0
some things to be in a certain way

6442.08 --> 6447.3
mostly Financial

6444.0 --> 6449.46
and having like I need the time I I have

6447.3 --> 6451.320000000001
this now I have a job now it's called

6449.46 --> 6452.82
Flat Earth early bird show and the

6451.32 --> 6457.159
flatters debate

6452.82 --> 6457.159
and like Shaman Duty

6457.199 --> 6462.54
thinking dream walking all day long

6459.54 --> 6462.54
Non-Stop

6462.9 --> 6466.58
I live it I dream it

6467.1 --> 6472.56
and yeah it gets a little lonely

6469.08 --> 6475.139
sometimes they don't have the room for

6472.56 --> 6477.659000000001
other stuff for other people like that I

6475.139 --> 6479.52
just don't have the room

6477.659 --> 6482.638999999999
and the people that I do actually

6479.52 --> 6485.219
communicate to in person like my

6482.639 --> 6488.88
roommate it's very cute

6485.219 --> 6491.159
they know exactly why that is because I

6488.88 --> 6493.38
show them like pretty much my full

6491.159 --> 6495.36
hyperactive energy

6493.38 --> 6497.639
and then they know

6495.36 --> 6499.5599999999995
and they understand why I don't really

6497.639 --> 6503.1
have an elaborate social life because

6499.56 --> 6505.9800000000005
most people just don't they can't do

6503.1 --> 6508.92
anything with that they get scared they

6505.98 --> 6511.94
get intimidated

6508.92 --> 6511.9400000000005
they get annoyed

6516.719 --> 6521.94
because I just like

6519.06 --> 6524.400000000001
once I really personally connect I

6521.94 --> 6525.48
really just I don't lift the veil I rip

6524.4 --> 6528.239
it away

6525.48 --> 6529.32
like I deny it exists that's what

6528.239 --> 6531.9
happens

6529.32 --> 6533.46
when you really get to know me I rip the

6531.9 --> 6536.219
veil away

6533.46 --> 6540.08
entirely

6536.219 --> 6540.08
different it is different

6541.8 --> 6546.5
right but hey if I got more room then

6547.56 --> 6552.96
I will like try to explore more see

6551.219 --> 6556.38
what's out there see if I can meet

6552.96 --> 6558.9
people especially people that are like

6556.38 --> 6560.400000000001
that would sympathize more with what I'm

6558.9 --> 6562.679
doing

6560.4 --> 6564.78
and get that

6562.679 --> 6566.639
and respect that

6564.78 --> 6568.199
on an intuitive level that would be

6566.639 --> 6572.099
great

6568.199 --> 6575.879999999999
yesterday like there's like cute women

6572.099 --> 6577.7390000000005
out there still that give me an eye

6575.88 --> 6580.38
and I give them an eye right back right

6577.739 --> 6583.44
that's still out there it's not like oh

6580.38 --> 6585.2390000000005
I'm so ugly I'm searching inside nobody

6583.44 --> 6589.0199999999995
wants yeah I'm pretty sure there's women

6585.239 --> 6590.339999999999
out there that find me very interesting

6589.02 --> 6594.119000000001
right

6590.34 --> 6597.2390000000005
I'm just not really

6594.119 --> 6599.098999999999
like I I don't want to risk

6597.239 --> 6602.36
it sounds really weird I don't want to

6599.099 --> 6602.360000000001
risk falling in love again

6605.219 --> 6609.199
I'm too focused on this [ __ ]

6613.38 --> 6615.86
right

6625.86 --> 6631.799999999999
because usually when I do I fall hard

6629.34 --> 6634.8
and then everything changes my interest

6631.8 --> 6634.8
changes

6638.159 --> 6643.199
right things that you kind of hold on to

6641.159 --> 6645.659
with some effort

6643.199 --> 6647.5199999999995
suddenly become really tiresome and then

6645.659 --> 6649.5
you just drop it and then everything

6647.52 --> 6650.88
changes that's what happens when I fall

6649.5 --> 6655.099
in love

6650.88 --> 6655.099
might be the same for some of you guys

6667.32 --> 6673.82
okay Terror 306 good to hear that the

6669.96 --> 6673.82
protests still going on

6675.06 --> 6684.320000000001
don't be let a [ __ ] get in the way of

6678.42 --> 6684.32
Effie respect thank you Rufus and humans

6685.08 --> 6687.679
right

6687.96 --> 6693.599
like unless

6689.76 --> 6695.280000000001
like but they wouldn't have to right

6693.599 --> 6698.159000000001
I mean

6695.28 --> 6701.4
can you imagine a woman that is actually

6698.159 --> 6703.92
attracted and attractive and

6701.4 --> 6706.259999999999
is interested in intellectual

6703.92 --> 6708.179
development and psychology and it

6706.26 --> 6712.08
actually wants a baby

6708.179 --> 6714.119
right that wants a family now that's

6712.08 --> 6716.94
if that's gonna happen nobody's gonna

6714.119 --> 6720.299999999999
stop me right you like if I get an

6716.94 --> 6722.94
opportunity like that you can't stop me

6720.3 --> 6724.8
but if it's just like another attractive

6722.94 --> 6728.839999999999
girl that just happens to think I'm kind

6724.8 --> 6728.84
of cute I'm not gonna like

6729.3 --> 6735.84
because I feel I have to go for that

6732.78 --> 6738.119
I mean yeah I'm not like closing all

6735.84 --> 6741.860000000001
doors I'm just not like

6738.119 --> 6741.86
going after it

6742.56 --> 6749.6990000000005
I mean if I like see that lady again

6746.58 --> 6752.28
and she gives me another look like that

6749.699 --> 6755.04
then I know like wait maybe they're

6752.28 --> 6756.9
actually attracted and it's not just in

6755.04 --> 6759.719
the moment or whatever

6756.9 --> 6763.44
you know who knows what's gonna happen

6759.719 --> 6765.179
it the communication with like

6763.44 --> 6767.699
pairing up

6765.179 --> 6769.619
it's always been very Elusive and

6767.699 --> 6771.9
ethereal

6769.619 --> 6775.199
when it happens it happens

6771.9 --> 6778.08
like when I met my ex I totally did not

6775.199 --> 6781.08
expect that all to unroll like that

6778.08 --> 6783.0599999999995
I just totally didn't expect it

6781.08 --> 6785.099
but it did

6783.06 --> 6787.9800000000005
and it went fully automated like I've

6785.099 --> 6790.5
been doing that all the time

6787.98 --> 6793.218999999999
that's how you know like okay this is

6790.5 --> 6793.219

7020.599 --> 7025.179
yeah

7022.699 --> 7025.178999999999
right

7032.54 --> 7037.159
now after this distance it becomes a

7035.06 --> 7040.159000000001
little like blurred or not blurred it's

7037.159 --> 7043.04
just like it just kind of

7040.159 --> 7045.619
starts to get wobbly

7043.04 --> 7048.46
but yeah I got pretty good eyes very

7045.619 --> 7048.46
happy about that

7050.84 --> 7056.0
how many fingers yeah it's a full hand

7054.57 --> 7058.04
[Music]

7056.0 --> 7060.199
yeah if you're gonna catch it then I'll

7058.04 --> 7062.8
be able to read it even after a bigger

7060.199 --> 7062.799999999999
distance so

7069.38 --> 7074.96
I mean you could you could test me if

7072.139 --> 7079.34
you want right write something that's

7074.96 --> 7081.139
not just a super basic sentence

7079.34 --> 7084.219
and I'll read it

7081.139 --> 7084.219
from this distance

7094.099 --> 7099.139
I caps it because you were in bed to

7097.94 --> 7101.619
read

7099.139 --> 7101.619
right

7110.48 --> 7118.839999999999
she's can be quite Smiley what smelly

7116.3 --> 7118.84
foreign

7133.639 --> 7139.58
what

7135.44 --> 7142.159
a get a bass tone

7139.58 --> 7148.179
what I can't figure out that first word

7142.159 --> 7148.179
the base tone denoted a bad age

7148.28 --> 7153.199
what

7150.139 --> 7158.54
okay you fast that's great for a second

7153.199 --> 7160.94
I read that as Chinese can be smelly

7158.54 --> 7163.46
right

7160.94 --> 7166.94
that's pretty impressive

7163.46 --> 7169.54
it's a palindrome okay

7166.94 --> 7169.54
so yeah

7173.48 --> 7176.678999999999
all right that's about

7179.9 --> 7185.119
two two and a half meters away roughly

7183.44 --> 7188.0
to the screen

7185.119 --> 7191.42
and think that

7188.0 --> 7194.619
let's just say that the typical size of

7191.42 --> 7194.619
the letters are

7194.9 --> 7198.04
two millimeters

7198.739 --> 7202.419999999999
yeah not bad

7210.92 --> 7216.32
a refraction bro

7214.219 --> 7219.02
yeah it doesn't matter if you don't see

7216.32 --> 7221.0599999999995
it where it really is geometrically in

7219.02 --> 7223.34
relation to Glow Earth it only matters

7221.06 --> 7225.320000000001
that you can make out what it is you're

7223.34 --> 7229.360000000001
seeing

7225.32 --> 7229.36
doesn't have to be in the correct place

7229.46 --> 7235.159
terrestrial refraction

7232.639 --> 7238.119
now turn backwards and cover one yeah

7235.159 --> 7238.119
very funny

7246.74 --> 7252.459
[Music]

7279.739 --> 7287.48
right yeah PGC net I get it

7284.239 --> 7289.638999999999
well for me the trick is also not

7287.48 --> 7290.78
reading all the time

7289.639 --> 7292.82
right

7290.78 --> 7294.5599999999995
there's certain types of muscles you're

7292.82 --> 7297.38
training

7294.56 --> 7300.619000000001
or you're using when you're reading

7297.38 --> 7303.4400000000005
to focus and all that don't overdo it

7300.619 --> 7305.0
but don't completely avoid it all

7303.44 --> 7309.82
together either because then your eyes

7305.0 --> 7309.82
become weak right so it's it's like

7309.86 --> 7314.9
have a proper balanced training for your

7312.8 --> 7318.9400000000005
eye muscles

7314.9 --> 7318.94
don't overdo it don't underdo it

7320.599 --> 7327.8
[ __ ] I'm 40 I have about four more years

7322.88 --> 7330.8
well in I'm not going for the 45.

7327.8 --> 7335.619000000001
like I'm not going to wear glasses or

7330.8 --> 7335.619000000001
lenses I still don't I'm 42.

7339.02 --> 7345.38
right I'll just be like oh I have to

7342.619 --> 7347.659
take a little bit more effort to read if

7345.38 --> 7350.26
it's really important maybe

7347.659 --> 7350.259999999999
right

7351.26 --> 7358.3
that just means like yeah read make sure

7354.98 --> 7358.299999999999
what you read is worth it

7367.76 --> 7372.92
right and also like a good training

7370.88 --> 7375.9800000000005
would be typically if you're going to be

7372.92 --> 7378.1990000000005
reading especially a book make sure you

7375.98 --> 7380.78
take breaks every now and then you don't

7378.199 --> 7382.58
just stare into the book for two hours

7380.78 --> 7386.84
dead straight

7382.58 --> 7387.739
she's like oh yeah look up look let your

7386.84 --> 7393.58
eyes

7387.739 --> 7393.58
like zoom out and basically like um

7396.56 --> 7400.9400000000005
let the muscles rest look at the outside

7398.9 --> 7403.46
look at other things than letters try

7400.94 --> 7404.78
not to decipher letters right

7403.46 --> 7407.54
so you just

7404.78 --> 7410.239
take a break reading and then

7407.54 --> 7412.46
once you feel like Ah that's what that

7410.239 --> 7416.598999999999
was nice then you go back and you do it

7412.46 --> 7419.179
again right that will probably also help

7416.599 --> 7421.9400000000005
like this this entire thing like oh

7419.179 --> 7424.82
everybody loses their eyesight oh really

7421.94 --> 7427.4
did that happen

7424.82 --> 7431.42
with the average population a hundred

7427.4 --> 7432.679
years ago 200 years ago 300 years ago I

7431.42 --> 7434.179
don't think so

7432.679 --> 7436.579
why

7434.179 --> 7438.8
well because they weren't like

7436.579 --> 7441.94
spending all their time all day long

7438.8 --> 7446.92
staring at boring papers or screens

7441.94 --> 7446.919999999999
especially stupid mobile screens right

7448.159 --> 7453.799999999999
it's all nerd complex that's why so many

7451.46 --> 7456.7390000000005
people have glasses now especially when

7453.8 --> 7460.04
they get older is because they're all in

7456.739 --> 7461.48
the same role as nerds like nerds had a

7460.04 --> 7462.8
lot of a lot of them had glass because

7461.48 --> 7466.178999999999
they would always be reading always

7462.8 --> 7466.179
behind the computer always

7469.34 --> 7471.9400000000005
okay

7482.119 --> 7488.239
you need sharp ears yeah of course

7485.179 --> 7491.4800000000005
I've got very sharp ears too I'm very

7488.239 --> 7493.459999999999
careful with them like early on

7491.48 --> 7496.4
when I was younger it's like oh go to

7493.46 --> 7498.92
party yeah disco or whatever

7496.4 --> 7501.259999999999
and I'd be like I hate this this music

7498.92 --> 7505.9400000000005
is too loud I'm going to go away now

7501.26 --> 7508.599
because I don't want my my brain damaged

7505.94 --> 7508.598999999999
from this

7510.139 --> 7516.38
right I'd avoid parties where the

7513.38 --> 7519.26
music's too loud and like really be

7516.38 --> 7522.1990000000005
persistent it's like I did that before I

7519.26 --> 7525.079000000001
started to avoid non-organic food right

7522.199 --> 7527.54
I was already careful with my ears at

7525.079 --> 7529.159
parties like yeah is this too loud that

7527.54 --> 7531.98
I don't want to be here

7529.159 --> 7534.219
that simple like I will not be there

7531.98 --> 7534.218999999999
then

7534.98 --> 7539.718999999999
right or earplugs but sometimes it's so

7538.04 --> 7541.82
loud it doesn't even matter it's like

7539.719 --> 7544.219
just gonna

7541.82 --> 7546.44
the resonance just gonna go straight

7544.219 --> 7548.719
through you and just crunch you right

7546.44 --> 7550.879999999999
too loud is bad

7548.719 --> 7553.28
I've always been very careful with that

7550.88 --> 7557.179
at a very young age already it was worn

7553.28 --> 7559.46
very early on by my parents about that

7557.179 --> 7563.54
right and my dad has like an hearing

7559.46 --> 7567.079
issue because he wasn't careful about it

7563.54 --> 7569.54
you like played in a band and all that

7567.079 --> 7572.299999999999
and was like playing right next to a

7569.54 --> 7574.82
speaker and then it literally just like

7572.3 --> 7578.719
destroyed

7574.82 --> 7582.32
high frequency receiving ability of one

7578.719 --> 7584.3
of his ears and it never came back

7582.32 --> 7588.44
he's had that the majority of his life

7584.3 --> 7591.26
right so yeah you learn don't expose

7588.44 --> 7596.0
your ears to too loud the noise

7591.26 --> 7598.6990000000005
don't over exhaust your eyes

7596.0 --> 7601.4
treat them well

7598.699 --> 7605.299999999999
and if you're like oh but I need to be

7601.4 --> 7608.239
able to read six hours straight

7605.3 --> 7611.42
yeah okay well in that case you're

7608.239 --> 7615.259999999999
literally dedicating to sacrificing your

7611.42 --> 7618.4
eyes then if that is what you want

7615.26 --> 7618.400000000001
so what you gonna get

7621.86 --> 7627.38
right more glasses yeah and then people

7624.38 --> 7629.84
put on glasses so it seems less tiresome

7627.38 --> 7632.42
but they're still abusing their eyes

7629.84 --> 7634.579
they're overusing it and then they need

7632.42 --> 7635.92
the glasses for that even and it all

7634.579 --> 7639.92
just

7635.92 --> 7644.179
it's like a person that over trains

7639.92 --> 7647.0
their muscle and then gets like issues

7644.179 --> 7649.4
right there's too much muscle their

7647.0 --> 7651.619
their bones can't handle it right they

7649.4 --> 7654.638999999999
didn't prepare properly like rast out

7651.619 --> 7654.639
would know everything about

7655.52 --> 7660.820000000001
you can do that [ __ ] with your eyes too

7657.98 --> 7663.379999999999
you can just overdo it

7660.82 --> 7665.0
unbalanced and you need glasses and then

7663.38 --> 7668.139
you keep going and then you basically

7665.0 --> 7668.139
[ __ ] up your eyes

7670.76 --> 7679.06
stop wearing earphones very good habit I

7674.599 --> 7679.06
stopped doing that a long time ago like

7679.099 --> 7684.02
15 years

7681.139 --> 7685.88
don't I don't wear headphones anymore in

7684.02 --> 7689.0
public

7685.88 --> 7690.619
let's go somewhere music no I always

7689.0 --> 7693.139
have

7690.619 --> 7696.079
I want to hear what's out there I want

7693.139 --> 7698.619
to hear the nature I want to hear

7696.079 --> 7698.619
everything

7699.38 --> 7701.9800000000005
foreign

7706.96 --> 7716.4800000000005
and we use in-ear monitors what in-ear

7712.219 --> 7719.9800000000005
monitors okay that sounds complicated

7716.48 --> 7719.98
if it works that's awesome

7720.199 --> 7725.619
how many hours a day do you use a

7722.36 --> 7725.619
computer screen a lot

7727.159 --> 7732.94
I'd say 10 10 hours 12 hours

7734.06 --> 7739.820000000001
right but I do get tired from it and

7737.599 --> 7741.38
then I take a break

7739.82 --> 7743.98
right

7741.38 --> 7747.579
I don't do it 10 hours straight

7743.98 --> 7747.579
I do it a lot

7748.88 --> 7756.400000000001
right but just like you would go to the

7752.3 --> 7756.400000000001
bathroom when your bladder is full

7756.44 --> 7765.759999999999
I take a break from staring at a screen

7761.719 --> 7765.76
when my eyes get tired from it

7768.679 --> 7770.86
foreign

7774.94 --> 7779.619
that sounds awesome very useful

7784.34 --> 7788.139
what kind of a band do you play in

7797.96 --> 7800.139
foreign

7859.94 --> 7863.598999999999
I think I'm gonna run out to show though

7862.04 --> 7865.9
because my eyes are getting kind of

7863.599 --> 7865.900000000001
tired

7869.06 --> 7872.38
and I'm getting hungry

7872.54 --> 7877.5199999999995
I got really disappointed Nathan isn't

7874.88 --> 7879.26
doing a live show again like come on

7877.52 --> 7881.780000000001
Nathan

7879.26 --> 7884.02
I mean you have a weekend for crying out

7881.78 --> 7884.0199999999995
loud

7884.42 --> 7888.38
you actually have to do the the weekday

7886.88 --> 7890.42
show

7888.38 --> 7892.9400000000005
if you keep skipping it there's not

7890.42 --> 7894.679
gonna be a show anymore you can do all

7892.94 --> 7897.98
the premieres you like but it's just

7894.679 --> 7900.1990000000005
gonna be one show then eventually you

7897.98 --> 7902.379999999999
gotta keep doing it

7900.199 --> 7902.379999999999
foreign

7920.139 --> 7925.46
way more than should be on average by

7922.82 --> 7927.679
chance okay rig back well maybe I do

7925.46 --> 7930.7390000000005
attract a bit of musicians I mean I

7927.679 --> 7934.46
literally come from a musician's family

7930.739 --> 7936.919999999999
my both my parents my parents were music

7934.46 --> 7939.7390000000005
teachers

7936.92 --> 7941.9
both of them

7939.739 --> 7945.98
so

7941.9 --> 7947.78
I'm very much used to people that would

7945.98 --> 7950.0599999999995
play in a band

7947.78 --> 7952.82
we had those types of people over the

7950.06 --> 7957.099
floor all the time and sometimes they

7952.82 --> 7957.099
would actually do jamming live there

7957.86 --> 7966.159
like funk music and a bit of rock and

7960.699 --> 7966.159
sometimes submitted more Jazzy stuff and

7966.8 --> 7969.579000000001
foreign

7973.659 --> 7981.619
like read a hyper awareness

7978.38 --> 7984.86
about sensory about hearing

7981.619 --> 7986.839999999999
good music quality using your senses

7984.86 --> 7989.96
properly your eyes properly protecting

7986.84 --> 7993.860000000001
like I am basically have full discipline

7989.96 --> 7997.219
of as if I would be um

7993.86 --> 7999.0199999999995
like a musical player but I don't I

7997.219 --> 8001.4800000000005
don't actually do that I'm more of an

7999.02 --> 8003.96
orator I turn into an orator not a

8001.48 --> 8003.959999999999
musician

8017.32 --> 8021.94
yeah man

8019.659 --> 8025.0599999999995
dude my parents played in a band

8021.94 --> 8027.94
together a funk band

8025.06 --> 8029.9800000000005
it was meh

8027.94 --> 8033.219
but they did have a lot of fun doing it

8029.98 --> 8033.218999999999
though apparently

8034.54 --> 8039.119
it's just that they didn't really have

8036.28 --> 8039.119
any good singer

8042.639 --> 8046.81
foreign

8043.67 --> 8046.81
[Music]

8052.139 --> 8056.28
classically trained pianist

8057.52 --> 8062.02
hmm

8059.98 --> 8064.119
yeah yeah my dad was all about the

8062.02 --> 8066.159000000001
guitar he can play some or he could play

8064.119 --> 8068.44
some guitar he doesn't do it anymore so

8066.159 --> 8071.32
he has problems with his fingers

8068.44 --> 8074.32
and my mother was

8071.32 --> 8077.88
quite capable with the piano

8074.32 --> 8081.82
she would compose her music on the piano

8077.88 --> 8083.1990000000005
I listened to at her processing composer

8081.82 --> 8086.92
it was fascinating one of the most

8083.199 --> 8089.739
fascinating things I've ever witnessed

8086.92 --> 8093.04
somebody being in the middle of

8089.739 --> 8096.4
composing classical music it's very

8093.04 --> 8098.619
fascinating to listen to very unique

8096.4 --> 8100.48
not a lot of people get to hear that

8098.619 --> 8104.139
process

8100.48 --> 8107.28
most people keep it very private but

8104.139 --> 8107.28
yeah I was the kid so

8110.44 --> 8114.82
then if you want to hear an example of

8112.42 --> 8116.4400000000005
that music my mother made then it's on

8114.82 --> 8118.659
my channel it's my called my mother's

8116.44 --> 8120.759999999999
music it's one of the first uploads I

8118.659 --> 8122.739
did

8120.76 --> 8124.84
it's a

8122.739 --> 8128.5
yeah

8124.84 --> 8132.4800000000005
I even played some of those songs on the

8128.5 --> 8132.48
flute with my parents

8139.84 --> 8147.06
right anyway I am rounding out the show

8143.26 --> 8147.06
but yeah it's been pretty cool

8148.84 --> 8154.079
it's always imagine it was me rocking

8151.119 --> 8154.079
the early bird guitar

8155.32 --> 8161.98
well I might be able to do that if I did

8160.06 --> 8164.9800000000005
some training I mean if it's just that

8161.98 --> 8166.598999999999
one thing I could probably try to learn

8164.98 --> 8169.0599999999995
to do that

8166.599 --> 8170.619000000001
but no it was Chris Berry it's all Chris

8169.06 --> 8173.26
Berry

8170.619 --> 8175.659
I gave him like metaphorical

8173.26 --> 8176.5
instructions of what I wanted it to be

8175.659 --> 8179.5599999999995
like

8176.5 --> 8183.82
he did a version it was getting close I

8179.56 --> 8187.2390000000005
told him like more classical

8183.82 --> 8189.5199999999995
less of a Melody Focus but like more

8187.239 --> 8191.5599999999995
like birds and he did it and just in the

8189.52 --> 8193.899000000001
second go was perfect

8191.56 --> 8195.76
it was exactly right and that's what we

8193.899 --> 8199.358999999999
got right now so it's all All About

8195.76 --> 8202.359
Chris Berry thank you bro for doing that

8199.359 --> 8205.42
I'm very happy with my intro but I did

8202.359 --> 8208.54
not play the guitar in that

8205.42 --> 8211.679
I did however assemble the video

8208.54 --> 8211.679
that part I did do

8212.319 --> 8216.0
what kind of music was it classical

8216.519 --> 8219.12
I mean

8219.46 --> 8227.16
my mother was a lot into jazz and funk

8223.479 --> 8227.16
but she did also

8227.5 --> 8232.26
like her own composition would be more

8229.899 --> 8232.26
classical

8233.74 --> 8238.26
anyway

8235.3 --> 8238.259999999998
see if I can

8246.88 --> 8250.438999999998
yeah it's not my video

8254.2 --> 8261.219000000001
I do have a link to it and I'll send it

8256.479 --> 8263.619999999999
to you so you can listen so yeah

8261.219 --> 8266.74
not Chuck Berry

8263.62 --> 8270.0
I don't think there's a relation

8266.74 --> 8270.0
I don't know who that is

8270.88 --> 8277.559
but Chris berries a flat earther and

8273.16 --> 8277.559
he's been around for quite a while too

8287.08 --> 8291.179
check it out when the stream ends all

8288.76 --> 8291.179
right cool

8291.819 --> 8296.979
right but I am rounding out so

8294.58 --> 8298.179
thanks everyone for coming I hope you

8296.979 --> 8301.66
like this show

8298.179 --> 8304.0
it was kind of all over the place yeah

8301.66 --> 8306.399
pretty much really over the place in all

8304.0 --> 8309.34
kinds of ways all kinds of directions

8306.399 --> 8312.039999999999
but still very fluid I hope you thought

8309.34 --> 8314.139000000001
