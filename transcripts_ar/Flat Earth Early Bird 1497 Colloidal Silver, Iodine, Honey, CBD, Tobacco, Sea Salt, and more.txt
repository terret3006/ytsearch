kinda

95.159 --> 101.04
it's a bit windy clouds up there rushing

98.64 --> 104.42
but also blue spots and there's been

101.04 --> 104.42
some nice sunlight

106.619 --> 113.13
I think it's less cold than yesterday

110.899 --> 115.68
check the temperature

113.13 --> 119.0
[Music]

115.68 --> 119.0
right no rain or anything

119.88 --> 124.259
just a little bit of rain yesterday

122.22 --> 125.82
night

124.259 --> 127.56
very short

125.82 --> 131.459
right

127.56 --> 134.459
anyway it is Monday the 30th of January

131.459 --> 134.459
2023

139.92 --> 144.319
temperature is 9 degrees Celsius right

145.319 --> 149.189
um

145.97 --> 149.189
[Music]

149.52 --> 155.0
and yeah it seems like it's going to be

151.5 --> 155.0
kind of like that all week

155.04 --> 161.04
foreign so yeah

158.879 --> 164.22
the cold spell

161.04 --> 167.099
maybe over at least for a while might

164.22 --> 169.8
come back in February

167.099 --> 172.26
but for now it seems like it's pretty

169.8 --> 173.81900000000002
mild weather

172.26 --> 176.12
from now on

173.819 --> 176.11999999999998
right

176.28 --> 179.9
away yeah I'm a little late

180.35 --> 183.41
[Music]

184.68 --> 192.06
that was just very comfortable in my bed

187.76 --> 196.67999999999998
even after my alarm clock went off

192.06 --> 197.81900000000002
and so yeah it got up a little late

196.68 --> 202.98000000000002
yeah

197.819 --> 207.83999999999997
15 past 12. quarter past 12.

202.98 --> 211.64
and it all just took a little longer

207.84 --> 211.64000000000001
right but I'm here now

212.4 --> 216.3
and yeah I don't have a subject really

214.319 --> 218.76
I'm still just kind of digesting

216.3 --> 221.09900000000002
yesterday's show which I really thought

218.76 --> 224.28
was awesome I watched it back and it was

221.099 --> 228.23899999999998
better than I thought it was actually

224.28 --> 230.879
thought I was being kind of annoying and

228.239 --> 234.0
disruptive a little jumping in too much

230.879 --> 236.39999999999998
but when I watched it back yeah I did it

234.0 --> 239.099
a couple of times but it wasn't it

236.4 --> 242.09900000000002
didn't even stand out to me at all

239.099 --> 245.33999999999997
so yeah that turned out great

242.099 --> 246.72
and it would be pretty cool to share the

245.34 --> 249.48
show

246.72 --> 252.62
with others I mean it was like a zero

249.48 --> 252.61999999999998
percent rage win show

254.28 --> 257.34
yeah

255.299 --> 260.94
great very shareable

257.34 --> 264.35999999999996
only downside is that he wasn't there on

260.94 --> 267.18
camera but I couldn't get OBS to work

264.36 --> 269.16
like it refused to show

267.18 --> 271.32
this guide with the video it just

269.16 --> 274.82000000000005
refused to just showed a black screen I

271.32 --> 274.82
don't know why very weird

277.44 --> 280.56
right

278.759 --> 283.139
but maybe if I want to do this more

280.56 --> 285.66
often I have to use something Elder

283.139 --> 287.82
than Skype

285.66 --> 289.259
like maybe stream yard or something I

287.82 --> 290.58
don't know if there's any costs that

289.259 --> 292.91900000000004
come with that

290.58 --> 295.8
but I've seen other people use stream

292.919 --> 298.5
yard a lot and it has a very good like

295.8 --> 301.5
window distribution system

298.5 --> 303.02
where you can arrange how the cameras

301.5 --> 304.44
are very easily

303.02 --> 308.58
[Music]

304.44 --> 310.68
so that it could put us both like in or

308.58 --> 311.82
if there's even more gas into like a

310.68 --> 314.94
block

311.82 --> 317.419
arranged in a certain way very easily

314.94 --> 317.419
so

318.18 --> 323.34000000000003
but that's for next time

321.54 --> 326.3
right

323.34 --> 326.29999999999995
where is everybody

327.72 --> 331.639
is everybody sleeping out late today

335.67 --> 339.35
[Music]

346.919 --> 350.71999999999997
it says eight watching

353.759 --> 356.12
right

358.259 --> 361.16
all right

361.38 --> 364.38
anyway

366.96 --> 373.82
yesterday uh only real streams out there

370.56 --> 373.82
were flat zoids

375.18 --> 381.06
and yeah that was that was kind of fun

378.9 --> 384.06
uh Quantum of conscious also had another

381.06 --> 387.8
free voice Sunday

384.06 --> 387.8
screen which was good

390.0 --> 394.16
very interesting what he's doing these

392.039 --> 394.15999999999997
days

396.0 --> 400.44
I mean like

397.919 --> 402.65999999999997
his ideas are very similar to mine it's

400.44 --> 404.639
just that he's focused on a very

402.66 --> 405.85
specific aspect of the whole thing

404.639 --> 407.16
continually

405.85 --> 411.36
[Music]

407.16 --> 413.819
but his ideas of like a

411.36 --> 416.639
constant dichotomy that is being created

413.819 --> 418.68
to polarize and keep us stuck that is

416.639 --> 420.5
very sensible that's a very sensible

418.68 --> 425.18
thing that he's been

420.5 --> 425.18
refining in his story telling

426.84 --> 432.0
and I resonate a lot with that I talk

429.419 --> 433.56
about that in my own way

432.0 --> 435.419
right

433.56 --> 436.919
so yeah check out Quantum of conscious

435.419 --> 440.78
if you haven't watched that

436.919 --> 440.78
hey flutter Sage first in chat

443.039 --> 448.31899999999996
you're so bummed out you missed it oh

446.52 --> 451.25899999999996
well

448.319 --> 453.78000000000003
look I was I wasn't really interacting

451.259 --> 455.759
with chat a lot so it was really just an

453.78 --> 456.96
interview with the chat on the side I

455.759 --> 459.599
mean

456.96 --> 461.63899999999995
and stats did actually interact with the

459.599 --> 464.96
chat a bit but it was just

461.639 --> 468.12
like like why are they so rowdy

464.96 --> 470.039
because everybody was kind of rowdy

468.12 --> 473.699
right

470.039 --> 473.699
so yeah

479.099 --> 482.18
hello price of Adam

482.599 --> 488.3
right but yeah just watch it it was

485.699 --> 488.3
interesting

490.44 --> 492.68
foreign

493.74 --> 496.869
[Music]

503.46 --> 507.96
right well anyway other than that I've

506.099 --> 510.12
mostly like been playing baller skate

507.96 --> 513.18
again

510.12 --> 516.08
I'm like finishing the Saga

513.18 --> 516.0799999999999
very soon

518.459 --> 523.26
such a long long ass game because it's

521.339 --> 526.32
really just one game I'll just get one

523.26 --> 529.76
well skate two I don't know about it's

526.32 --> 529.7600000000001
it is one story

529.92 --> 534.06
and it

531.42 --> 536.9399999999999
music changes

534.06 --> 538.7399999999999
like becomes for more mysterious and

536.94 --> 540.8000000000001
subtle and

538.74 --> 544.8
wondering

540.8 --> 548.279
towards more more action more

544.8 --> 551.88
like Terror and then like really in the

548.279 --> 555.24
last game it's all very bombastic

551.88 --> 557.16
so even the music like changes with the

555.24 --> 560.519
with the scene yeah with the atmosphere

557.16 --> 563.16
with the way the game is and it's it is

560.519 --> 566.12
a remarkable

563.16 --> 566.12
piece of art

567.66 --> 572.459
and that's why I I keep playing it every

570.42 --> 574.68
night periodically I mean I've played

572.459 --> 575.9399999999999
this entire game through so many times

574.68 --> 578.8389999999999
it's

575.94 --> 578.839
I've lost count

578.94 --> 584.4590000000001
must be like

581.279 --> 586.4399999999999
a hundred times at least maybe more

584.459 --> 590.5189999999999
probably more

586.44 --> 592.3800000000001
I know like almost every thing like by

590.519 --> 593.58
heart they just know like where are all

592.38 --> 596.519
the quests

593.58 --> 598.38
and if I don't know a detail then there

596.519 --> 601.5600000000001
is a like a very easy

598.38 --> 604.2
website to look it up

601.56 --> 606.54
but I just played through it so many

604.2 --> 607.5600000000001
times I just almost know every detail of

606.54 --> 609.7199999999999
it

607.56 --> 612.18
know where every item is know what the

609.72 --> 614.4590000000001
quests are

612.18 --> 617.5799999999999
Etc but it's still

614.459 --> 619.0799999999999
still fun to play anyway

617.58 --> 620.5600000000001
I know

619.08 --> 622.8000000000001
classical homeopath

620.56 --> 625.9799999999999
[Music]

622.8 --> 629.6999999999999
you can use streamware for free ah right

625.98 --> 632.4200000000001
yeah then I will definitely try that

629.7 --> 632.4200000000001
definitely

635.64 --> 640.76
and try if I see if I can use that the

638.339 --> 640.7600000000001
next time

641.42 --> 646.0999999999999
Boulder skating it's with just a

648.0 --> 652.98
probably never play that

650.7 --> 654.839
well visually it's not super interesting

652.98 --> 656.339
to look at really

654.839 --> 658.62
I mean

656.339 --> 662.4590000000001
it's

658.62 --> 664.14
it's like uh it does it's uh what do you

662.459 --> 666.4899999999999
call that it's not perspective view

664.14 --> 669.42
technically

666.49 --> 674.0
[Music]

669.42 --> 674.0
you just have small figures but

674.76 --> 680.64
the the music is amazing there's a lot

678.54 --> 683.8199999999999
of sound effects so like if you walk

680.64 --> 686.8199999999999
around the board which it kind of is

683.82 --> 689.5790000000001
then where you're at

686.82 --> 692.0400000000001
like changes the background sounds a lot

689.579 --> 693.42
it's like they spend so much time on

692.04 --> 696.66
sounds

693.42 --> 699.959
music and background sounds that are

696.66 --> 701.6999999999999
very local and and the voices like a lot

699.959 --> 704.8199999999999
of voices

701.7 --> 707.76
like spoken dialogue up on on top of

704.82 --> 711.12
text if it's like if it's important

707.76 --> 713.519
especially part of the the main story

711.12 --> 716.1
it's a lot of spoken and like very

713.519 --> 718.32
eloquent like they put a lot of effort

716.1 --> 720.4200000000001
in it there's like one voice actor has

718.32 --> 723.3000000000001
multiple types of voices you can kind of

720.42 --> 725.279
hear it's him but still it's done he's

723.3 --> 725.8399999999999
just putting in so much effort and all

725.279 --> 728.879
of them are

725.84 --> 728.879
[Music]

732.72 --> 737.22
so I think it's a brilliant game

735.12 --> 741.3
especially just

737.22 --> 744.839
audio wise brilliant

741.3 --> 748.019
one of the biggest efforts that I've

744.839 --> 750.6800000000001
ever come across in video games like

748.019 --> 750.68
sound wise

755.66 --> 760.76
right and it works I mean there's newer

759.66 --> 764.76
games

760.76 --> 766.68
that have like or even 3D and even more

764.76 --> 769.56
expensive dialogue

766.68 --> 774.0
but those games are like

769.56 --> 778.079
not super replayable

774.0 --> 781.56
you see I mean Dragon Age for example

778.079 --> 782.8199999999999
from the late 90s I think or early 2000s

781.56 --> 784.5
somewhere

782.82 --> 785.3000000000001
I don't remember exactly when it came

784.5 --> 789.3
out

785.3 --> 792.9799999999999
no it was late it was later uh like 2003

789.3 --> 794.7199999999999
or something but it had

792.98 --> 800.04
really

794.72 --> 802.74
Dynamic dialogue and like 3D

800.04 --> 804.54
conversations

802.74 --> 806.339
there's other games that's done that

804.54 --> 808.38
have done it even better with more

806.339 --> 810.6600000000001
better characters but it has like some

808.38 --> 813.42
decent character character development

810.66 --> 815.639
in there that game I like played like

813.42 --> 817.019
three times four times and then I'm like

815.639 --> 819.6800000000001
yeah

817.019 --> 819.68
I mean

820.38 --> 824.639
I get it now

822.839 --> 826.5600000000001
and a lot of it was kind of like

824.639 --> 829.8
uncomfortable in a way

826.56 --> 832.0189999999999
well with Baldur's Gate the darkness is

829.8 --> 834.3599999999999
technically much thicker in the story

832.019 --> 837.019
it's much darker

834.36 --> 837.019
but

838.26 --> 843.12
it doesn't make me as uncomfortable as

841.139 --> 845.7
like things in Dragon Age where you

843.12 --> 847.62
basically get imagery of horror [ __ ]

845.7 --> 850.9200000000001
like really stuffed in your face I mean

847.62 --> 854.339
when you see horror [ __ ] in Baldur's

850.92 --> 856.26
Gate it's different because it's like a

854.339 --> 858.0
creature that just looks like oh what

856.26 --> 860.579
the [ __ ] is that so I'm kind of a demon

858.0 --> 862.98
with like multiple arms and tentacles

860.579 --> 867.5999999999999
and it's creepy but you don't get it

862.98 --> 870.0600000000001
like ah in your face right so it's

867.6 --> 871.98
you do have that in Dragon Age where

870.06 --> 873.899
like they're really [ __ ] up gross

871.98 --> 875.88
monsters are like in your face like

873.899 --> 878.76
taking up the full screen at some point

875.88 --> 880.86
it's just gross

878.76 --> 882.48
make me kind of uncomfortable at times

880.86 --> 883.86
well with bothers gate you don't have

882.48 --> 886.6800000000001
that

883.86 --> 888.899
so yeah things are scary but you're

886.68 --> 892.0999999999999
mostly just focused on like how to make

888.899 --> 892.1
your character survive

893.279 --> 898.399
and the music

895.56 --> 898.399
too anyway

899.22 --> 906.6
so yeah visually not super Advanced but

903.0 --> 908.699
that's like good it's good that it's not

906.6 --> 910.74
super Advanced I like it and it's super

908.699 --> 913.579
fluid I mean that game can run on like

910.74 --> 913.5790000000001
any computer now

918.44 --> 925.74
right you can have fantastic sound

922.019 --> 928.199
quality and it'll barely take up any

925.74 --> 931.5
computer space right it's with games

928.199 --> 934.5
it's always the graphics

931.5 --> 937.139
that make it luggish and oh your

934.5 --> 939.0
computer is not fast enough

937.139 --> 940.74
you need a newer version yeah that's

939.0 --> 943.32
because of the graphics not of because

940.74 --> 946.5600000000001
of the music never because of the music

943.32 --> 950.6600000000001
so polish gate can run on like really

946.56 --> 950.66
old PCS and still work

953.04 --> 958.86
anyway

955.86 --> 958.86
ah

958.98 --> 964.5600000000001
have I played Dragon Age Inquisition

962.339 --> 967.44
uh

964.56 --> 969.54
I played the second dragon age for a bit

967.44 --> 972.4200000000001
but I just I didn't have any more

969.54 --> 974.279
interest I didn't like the second one

972.42 --> 977.279
way too linear

974.279 --> 979.139
and then I just kind of like

977.279 --> 981.8389999999999
stop

979.139 --> 985.8
I wasn't interested anymore

981.839 --> 988.639
and in general I don't play 3D games I

985.8 --> 988.639
just don't do it anymore

989.1 --> 994.8000000000001
right before that time I would even play

991.86 --> 997.6800000000001
like Half-Life and Half-Life 2 or with

994.8 --> 1000.5
Half-Life 2 like a first person I got so

997.68 --> 1002.779
sick so physically ill that I realized

1000.5 --> 1005.36
like I can't handle 3D

1002.779 --> 1007.459
and the more realistic it is the more

1005.36 --> 1009.92
sick I get because of it

1007.459 --> 1011.899
because of the moving around while I'm

1009.92 --> 1015.16
actually sitting still and it's really

1011.899 --> 1015.16
messing with my senses

1016.82 --> 1022.82
so I just don't like first perspective

1019.339 --> 1026.439
3D games at all anymore I avoid them

1022.82 --> 1026.439
really avoid them

1030.199 --> 1035.26
like even watching for example Minecraft

1036.02 --> 1041.48
Minecraft I mean

1038.24 --> 1045.4
which is first person based like that is

1041.48 --> 1045.4
not super comfortable for me to look at

1046.4 --> 1051.3200000000002
now when it's a third person like you're

1048.799 --> 1053.9
looking top down on a figure

1051.32 --> 1057.32
then it's slightly that helps that helps

1053.9 --> 1060.5800000000002
make it less nauseating for me

1057.32 --> 1060.58
but still

1063.02 --> 1068.24
I just don't I don't do it anymore I

1066.26 --> 1071.14
don't watch other people play those

1068.24 --> 1071.14
video games either

1071.6 --> 1075.1999999999998
yeah

1073.16 --> 1077.3600000000001
because that also makes me sick I mean

1075.2 --> 1079.64
I've even in the past like

1077.36 --> 1083.7199999999998
somebody's playing it like a 3D video

1079.64 --> 1085.3400000000001
game somewhere and then I'm watching and

1083.72 --> 1087.44
then I'm noticing okay I have to stop

1085.34 --> 1090.9399999999998
watching like

1087.44 --> 1090.94
because I just get nauseated

1093.799 --> 1098.059
like

1095.6 --> 1101.1789999999999
one of the few type games where I don't

1098.059 --> 1103.72
have that are racing based 3D games

1101.179 --> 1103.72
because

1104.84 --> 1108.559
because yeah

1106.82 --> 1112.059
because in a way it's much more

1108.559 --> 1112.059
predictable what you're going to see

1113.299 --> 1119.179
and you don't have like in Walking human

1116.6 --> 1121.58
based 3D that you suddenly turn around

1119.179 --> 1124.16
and [ __ ] suddenly and like everything

1121.58 --> 1126.32
changes continually you don't have that

1124.16 --> 1130.22
as much you're just going you're turning

1126.32 --> 1132.62
slightly mostly right so that watching

1130.22 --> 1133.46
racing 3D games that doesn't make me

1132.62 --> 1136.0
sick

1133.46 --> 1136.0
anyway

1136.52 --> 1142.78
it's just how it works with me hello

1138.98 --> 1142.78
Luna loves you good to see you

1149.12 --> 1151.6599999999999
right

1154.24 --> 1159.74
but at mostly games that have top down

1157.52 --> 1162.26
views

1159.74 --> 1165.02
that don't automatically move with you

1162.26 --> 1168.08
where you basically have to scroll

1165.02 --> 1169.82
around the map like an eye in the sky

1168.08 --> 1172.6399999999999
those types of games

1169.82 --> 1175.11
those work fine for me and Baldur's Gate

1172.64 --> 1177.8600000000001
is is interfaced like that

1175.11 --> 1182.4399999999998
[Music]

1177.86 --> 1182.4399999999998
so civilization 5 which I play a lot

1182.86 --> 1187.9099999999999
[Music]

1186.32 --> 1191.109
right

1187.91 --> 1191.1090000000002
[Music]

1194.059 --> 1200.299
Boulder Sky dude price of Adam you think

1196.7 --> 1205.4
that oh Ballers gate yeah no [ __ ] dude

1200.299 --> 1209.36
you know who Bao is in the game is the

1205.4 --> 1212.74
Lord of murder so yeah I mean it's not

1209.36 --> 1212.74
super covert

1215.36 --> 1217.9599999999998
but

1219.98 --> 1229.7
right is it bow though yeah it is bao

1224.66 --> 1232.22
but Baldur's Gate is not because of bao

1229.7 --> 1236.98
it's because of balder who is just a

1232.22 --> 1236.98
figure who originally founded that City

1238.16 --> 1243.3200000000002
and there is like

1240.4 --> 1246.88
boldier it is basically a reference to

1243.32 --> 1246.8799999999999
uh Nordic names

1248.84 --> 1253.4599999999998
I think

1250.4 --> 1254.9
not necessary bow but I mean Baldur's

1253.46 --> 1257.8400000000001
Gate is

1254.9 --> 1260.0
well Ballers get is just a city right so

1257.84 --> 1262.8799999999999
it's not literally just about that City

1260.0 --> 1264.559
I mean in the game like especially the

1262.88 --> 1267.16
first game yeah it is very much about

1264.559 --> 1267.16
that City

1267.74 --> 1272.539
in the second game you don't even the

1270.5 --> 1274.82
city is Out Of Reach you basically fled

1272.539 --> 1276.98
it because of story development that

1274.82 --> 1279.08
happened in well that they don't they

1276.98 --> 1283.7
didn't tell you originally but then

1279.08 --> 1285.1999999999998
Baldur's Gate 1.5 came out Dragon spear

1283.7 --> 1289.1000000000001
right

1285.2 --> 1291.44
and that in there they basically show

1289.1 --> 1293.059
you as part of the story like why you

1291.44 --> 1296.8600000000001
had to flee it

1293.059 --> 1296.86
because you were set up

1296.96 --> 1300.98
at the end of it

1298.76 --> 1304.0
right but

1300.98 --> 1304.0
yeah it is about

1306.86 --> 1312.02
yeah about your story it is

1310.159 --> 1314.3600000000001
the of the main character that you are

1312.02 --> 1316.76
you can shape him however you want but

1314.36 --> 1319.4599999999998
the storyline happens the same every

1316.76 --> 1323.24
time you start in Candle keep

1319.46 --> 1326.3600000000001
faster with your Foster Father Brian

1323.24 --> 1328.88
and then one day he's trying to like

1326.36 --> 1331.34
sneak you out or something

1328.88 --> 1333.0200000000002
but you're like unaware and then he gets

1331.34 --> 1335.24
murdered by

1333.02 --> 1336.9189999999999
yeah the main opponent of the game

1335.24 --> 1339.02
several

1336.919 --> 1340.76
you don't know his name at first I'm

1339.02 --> 1343.94
spoiling a bit if you've never played it

1340.76 --> 1346.52
then don't listen to me but

1343.94 --> 1348.38
it always develops from there and yeah

1346.52 --> 1350.6589999999999
you get involved in big things and in

1348.38 --> 1353.179
the end it's like it's basically a sort

1350.659 --> 1357.74
of world war situation

1353.179 --> 1359.539
where your fellow half Brothers

1357.74 --> 1361.88
out there because you have a lot

1359.539 --> 1365.6589999999999
apparently you figure out later

1361.88 --> 1368.419
that you are like the son of of ball

1365.659 --> 1371.5390000000002
with many others that and like there's

1368.419 --> 1374.179
horrible like human sacrifice [ __ ] and

1371.539 --> 1376.52
like really dark stuff that you were

1374.179 --> 1378.38
basically pulled out of because you were

1376.52 --> 1382.28
supposed to be sacrificed as a child

1378.38 --> 1385.46
it's a really dark story okay to to

1382.28 --> 1388.1
resurrect the Lord of murder again

1385.46 --> 1390.74
but that didn't happen it was disturbed

1388.1 --> 1393.08
by your Foster father

1390.74 --> 1394.7
and you were rescued and you didn't know

1393.08 --> 1396.6789999999999
that at the start

1394.7 --> 1398.96
and their story rolls out you not

1396.679 --> 1401.8400000000001
knowing so there's a real like story

1398.96 --> 1404.179
development element that's very well

1401.84 --> 1406.8799999999999
taken care of and subtle

1404.179 --> 1409.1000000000001
about it as well it's a good interesting

1406.88 --> 1411.44
story to read

1409.1 --> 1414.98
because it is like polish gate is just

1411.44 --> 1416.48
like a book except it's a video game

1414.98 --> 1418.28
it's a

1416.48 --> 1420.44
a book

1418.28 --> 1424.039
audiobook

1420.44 --> 1426.559
and with like some action in it's like

1424.039 --> 1429.26
an action video game that is also just a

1426.559 --> 1432.26
book and audiobook

1429.26 --> 1432.26
anyway

1432.679 --> 1437.539
your suggesting more okay what

1437.6 --> 1442.4189999999999
all right

1439.58 --> 1442.4189999999999
fine whatever

1446.6 --> 1452.0
but it's yeah the story is pretty damn

1448.82 --> 1453.559
dark but the setup is roughly and it

1452.0 --> 1456.86
becomes more and more clear it is

1453.559 --> 1459.58
basically the Highlander plot there can

1456.86 --> 1459.58
be only one

1460.88 --> 1468.44
but instead of the great price becoming

1463.64 --> 1470.2990000000002
a mortal dyable human being

1468.44 --> 1472.4
because you're not Immortal in that game

1470.299 --> 1476.78
you don't necessarily have to have your

1472.4 --> 1479.539
head chopped up to succeed like that

1476.78 --> 1484.0
but yeah the end price is that you can

1479.539 --> 1484.0
basically Ascend the Throne of ball

1484.28 --> 1488.6
or like dissoluted

1488.9 --> 1494.8400000000001
that is the prize in the end of the game

1490.9 --> 1499.159
like the the last the last game which is

1494.84 --> 1499.1589999999999
literally called Throne a ball anyway

1504.02 --> 1509.299
but really the thing that makes me

1506.36 --> 1511.78
coming back to this game is the music it

1509.299 --> 1511.78
really is

1514.82 --> 1521.36
and I I've also never really found

1517.94 --> 1524.72
another game that has been so successful

1521.36 --> 1527.36
with music implementation as the baller

1524.72 --> 1530.6000000000001
skate series I've never met a single

1527.36 --> 1532.279
game that could even get close to that

1530.6 --> 1535.039
quality level

1532.279 --> 1537.32
and that especially includes Baldur's

1535.039 --> 1539.36
Gate 3 which is an Abomination compared

1537.32 --> 1543.08
to the originals

1539.36 --> 1544.34
has nothing to do with the original

1543.08 --> 1546.02
I mean

1544.34 --> 1549.4599999999998
you might as just as well called

1546.02 --> 1552.2
Baldur's Gate 3 Neverwinter Knights 3

1549.46 --> 1555.64
because it's much more like never winter

1552.2 --> 1555.64
nights than Ballers gay

1557.299 --> 1566.9
the same type of interface

1560.919 --> 1570.1000000000001
3D up close conversations oh buddy buddy

1566.9 --> 1570.1000000000001
it's just no

1578.659 --> 1581.2
anyway

1585.7 --> 1591.14
right so yeah don't have to talk about

1588.74 --> 1592.94
video games all day I'm just talking

1591.14 --> 1595.539
about it right now

1592.94 --> 1595.539
uh

1596.299 --> 1600.9189999999999
how are you guys doing

1598.82 --> 1603.039
what's happening out there is there

1600.919 --> 1603.039
anything

1603.2 --> 1606.94
you would like to bring to my attention

1622.47 --> 1625.749
[Music]

1627.159 --> 1631.5800000000002
oh Benjamin by the way is kind of sick I

1630.44 --> 1633.26
think

1631.58 --> 1636.279
because he didn't even do like a

1633.26 --> 1636.279
Saturday stream or anything

1637.58 --> 1640.779
hope you'll be all right

1652.7 --> 1661.24
okay fighter Sage yeah yeah coding

1657.02 --> 1661.24
yeah that's all very chemical and stuff

1663.5 --> 1669.88
it's not healthy

1665.419 --> 1669.88
good don't dip your fingers in that [ __ ]

1672.62 --> 1677.7199999999998
or wash it off really good I don't know

1675.02 --> 1680.44
I've never personally done it

1677.72 --> 1680.44
coding

1684.38 --> 1690.0200000000002
I mean if I wanted something coated

1688.22 --> 1692.419
like when I was still actively

1690.02 --> 1695.539
goldsmithing I would just go to somebody

1692.419 --> 1698.48
else like hey you're really good at this

1695.539 --> 1702.08
right could you do this

1698.48 --> 1704.8600000000001
because they would have the setup

1702.08 --> 1704.86
I didn't

1706.46 --> 1710.6000000000001
I've always been much more often just

1708.38 --> 1713.44
like take the piece of metal and make

1710.6 --> 1713.4399999999998
something out of it

1715.94 --> 1720.039
coding has never been in my interest

1722.96 --> 1726.46
colloidal silver maker cool

1727.79 --> 1733.24
[Music]

1730.58 --> 1733.24
hmm

1758.539 --> 1762.94
you'll learn how to use it when they

1760.64 --> 1762.94
what

1766.64 --> 1768.8200000000002
foreign

1771.88 --> 1777.94
use colloidal silver a lot I have used

1775.64 --> 1777.94
it

1779.24 --> 1783.32
uh I don't think I even have any right

1782.48 --> 1787.34
now

1783.32 --> 1789.3799999999999
not sure yeah I do actually but

1787.34 --> 1791.059
I just never get to the point where I'm

1789.38 --> 1792.7990000000002
like oh [ __ ] I'm really gonna get sick

1791.059 --> 1794.48
sometimes I gotta like a bit of a rough

1792.799 --> 1796.84
throat and then I'm like oh I got to be

1794.48 --> 1796.84
careful

1798.039 --> 1804.62
but it never turns into actually like

1801.74 --> 1807.559
full-blown coughing and [ __ ]

1804.62 --> 1809.4799999999998
it hasn't for ages it's just like

1807.559 --> 1813.44
periods where I'm like almost getting

1809.48 --> 1814.64
sick and then it just stops again

1813.44 --> 1817.8690000000001
that keeps happening

1814.64 --> 1817.8690000000001
[Music]

1818.96 --> 1822.919
so apparently my system can't just

1820.76 --> 1825.02
handle whatever's going on without

1822.919 --> 1827.24
actually

1825.02 --> 1829.7
me getting sick from it

1827.24 --> 1831.86
so how I see it is that basically I

1829.7 --> 1834.26
might effectively be getting sick it's

1831.86 --> 1837.82
just that my body

1834.26 --> 1841.46
can very easily process the typical

1837.82 --> 1845.62
toxins and issues that come with that so

1841.46 --> 1845.6200000000001
easily that I I don't even really notice

1847.279 --> 1854.299
I just noticed slight discomfort for a

1850.039 --> 1856.22
bit and then it's just back to normal

1854.299 --> 1859.6
I'm very happy about that by the way I

1856.22 --> 1859.6000000000001
don't like getting sick at all

1869.539 --> 1876.1
I mean since 2019 I don't remember even

1872.6 --> 1876.1
having been really sick

1876.22 --> 1880.34
at all

1878.779 --> 1882.799
like

1880.34 --> 1886.24
what I mean I would get sick because of

1882.799 --> 1889.34
like just feeling really bad or alcohol

1886.24 --> 1891.5
related issues right with the absent

1889.34 --> 1892.76
[ __ ] that I flush down the toilet

1891.5 --> 1896.779
eventually

1892.76 --> 1899.0
but other than like net not like regular

1896.779 --> 1901.159
sickness

1899.0 --> 1904.34
like the flu

1901.159 --> 1906.3200000000002
or cold that is persistent I had just

1904.34 --> 1909.74
haven't had one of those

1906.32 --> 1909.74
since 2019.

1916.1 --> 1918.52
anyway

1940.52 --> 1943.24
oh nice

1944.6 --> 1949.039
wow that's great rise of Adam

1947.179 --> 1951.2
awesome

1949.039 --> 1953.72
yeah I mean if you especially like with

1951.2 --> 1955.94
nasty infections it's great and you can

1953.72 --> 1959.059
use it topical too I mean

1955.94 --> 1962.799
if you get like a dirty wound yeah just

1959.059 --> 1962.799
throw some colloidal silver in there

1963.08 --> 1968.32
I think that works better than any other

1965.24 --> 1968.32
disinfectant actually

1972.52 --> 1977.72
a lumpy gas in a vacuum good to see you

1975.32 --> 1979.76
good job on sober

1977.72 --> 1981.08
that that's kind of funny by the way

1979.76 --> 1984.94
that you mentioned that because I did

1981.08 --> 1984.9399999999998
actually have one beer again yesterday

1985.159 --> 1988.0590000000002
with my pizza

1989.539 --> 1992.08
but

1993.86 --> 1997.82
yeah I still don't know what to think

1996.26 --> 1999.74
about it I mean

1997.82 --> 2002.9189999999999
I talked about with like one of the

1999.74 --> 2005.26
girls in the supermarket too like yeah I

2002.919 --> 2009.1000000000001
just drink like I'm setting it roughly

2005.26 --> 2012.64
to One Beer a week now in my mind might

2009.1 --> 2015.039
not even be that less than that even

2012.64 --> 2018.179
but yeah compared to like

2015.039 --> 2018.179
uh what was it

2018.64 --> 2025.2990000000002
three beers a day

2021.039 --> 2028.179
every day that's quite a bit better if I

2025.299 --> 2030.84
if I say so myself

2028.179 --> 2030.8400000000001
and

2032.019 --> 2034.5
yeah

2034.539 --> 2039.1
I mean the beer yesterday

2036.76 --> 2040.6589999999999
it was it was just like a little bit

2039.1 --> 2043.4189999999999
enjoyable and

2040.659 --> 2045.1000000000001
and it was funny again because this is

2043.419 --> 2048.04
really standing out to me like after

2045.1 --> 2049.5989999999997
that beer I was kind of glad I was done

2048.04 --> 2051.879
with the beer

2049.599 --> 2053.5
it's like yeah I have enough that one

2051.879 --> 2055.24
beer I don't want anymore it's really

2053.5 --> 2057.76
weird it's so different because since

2055.24 --> 2059.859
when I was drinking continually

2057.76 --> 2062.0800000000004
or like three beers a day

2059.859 --> 2064.419
for that first beer I definitely wanted

2062.08 --> 2067.2999999999997
more

2064.419 --> 2070.179
so it's like it's just changed

2067.3 --> 2071.8
how this works

2070.179 --> 2074.28
it's funny

2071.8 --> 2074.28
all right

2080.56 --> 2085.359
I'm yeah and I probably could say that I

2083.679 --> 2087.159
feel it a bit

2085.359 --> 2090.2799999999997
a little bit

2087.159 --> 2093.54
I mean I feel it despite going to bed

2090.28 --> 2093.5400000000004
not late or anything

2095.44 --> 2101.7400000000002
so again like just like last time I

2098.8 --> 2104.28
tried like yeah you do definitely notice

2101.74 --> 2104.2799999999997
the next day

2111.88 --> 2117.3
all right then best friend yeah sure you

2114.28 --> 2117.3
could use iodine

2119.98 --> 2124.9
you could use both

2121.96 --> 2127.079
but just colloidal silver works great as

2124.9 --> 2127.079
well

2130.66 --> 2136.5989999999997
and just like if your wound is really

2133.3 --> 2139.119
bad it's like really rough wound then

2136.599 --> 2143.94
iodine might be kind of painful

2139.119 --> 2143.94
colorless silver is not painful at all

2145.839 --> 2151.359
so I'd say actually that colloidal

2147.94 --> 2156.0
silver is better than iodine

2151.359 --> 2156.0
like when it comes to like wound care

2165.099 --> 2171.0
but I do also take iodine by the way but

2167.859 --> 2171.0
I I ingested

2171.66 --> 2178.18
The Alex Jones store

2174.88 --> 2181.32
and survival Shield X2 is really good

2178.18 --> 2181.3199999999997
stuff though so

2183.52 --> 2188.579
in taking that

2185.14 --> 2188.5789999999997
few times recently

2188.74 --> 2191.8199999999997
it's expensive

2192.099 --> 2197.579
it's not that expensive and you take

2194.38 --> 2197.579
forever with it

2198.22 --> 2204.64
I mean one of those bottles

2201.16 --> 2207.16
I can do like more than a year with it

2204.64 --> 2210.2799999999997
just one little bottle so

2207.16 --> 2210.2799999999997
[Music]

2210.46 --> 2215.68
and you don't even really necessarily

2212.44 --> 2218.28
have to take it like every day

2215.68 --> 2218.2799999999997
foreign

2218.619 --> 2223.48
for me that's been like one of the most

2220.72 --> 2225.339
worthwhile supplements

2223.48 --> 2228.099
to invest in

2225.339 --> 2230.44
thus far

2228.099 --> 2234.48
because you just do so long with it you

2230.44 --> 2234.48
don't have to continually take it

2237.82 --> 2244.9
[Music]

2239.859 --> 2248.23
at a gallon or like a fine what

2244.9 --> 2251.42
what are you talking about a gallon

2248.23 --> 2251.42
[Music]

2252.9 --> 2260.52
one ounce bottle for 130 Jesus that is

2257.5 --> 2260.52
extremely expensive

2276.339 --> 2282.42
why why

2278.5 --> 2282.42
where did you see that I mean

2282.48 --> 2289.38
this particular type of item I get from

2285.64 --> 2289.3799999999997
the infowar store and it's like

2290.32 --> 2294.839
at Max like 40 or something

2295.42 --> 2301.54
it's not that insanely expensive let me

2298.06 --> 2303.64
look it up actually I don't know

2301.54 --> 2305.68
and yeah I buy it when it's like a 50

2303.64 --> 2308.74
discount and [ __ ] and then yeah it's

2305.68 --> 2313.859
even less I mean a hundred

2308.74 --> 2313.859
Thirty no way no way

2314.26 --> 2323.599
foreign

2316.31 --> 2323.599
[Music]

2334.839 --> 2339.42
let's see

2337.119 --> 2339.42
okay

2345.24 --> 2349.859
they don't seem to be having it right

2347.619 --> 2349.859
now

2351.28 --> 2353.88
foreign

2380.68 --> 2383.5789999999997
what is it

2387.96 --> 2395.2200000000003
ah there it is yeah exactly it's forty

2391.42 --> 2395.2200000000003
dollars that's the full price

2395.8 --> 2400.119
so I don't know why you would pay a

2398.32 --> 2404.2200000000003
hundred and

2400.119 --> 2404.2200000000003
Thirty for that that's kind of crazy

2406.619 --> 2412.2400000000002
oh colloidal silver

2409.359 --> 2415.2
what that's even more crazy that stuff

2412.24 --> 2415.2
is really cheap

2415.69 --> 2420.54
[Music]

2416.92 --> 2424.2400000000002
I mean it could get like a liter bottle

2420.54 --> 2426.94
for what is it 20 euros

2424.24 --> 2431.04
so I don't know what kind of stuff

2426.94 --> 2431.04
you're talking about but that's insane

2445.119 --> 2449.94
maybe you need to call your mom

2447.22 --> 2449.9399999999996
Maybe

2455.079 --> 2459.6600000000003
and on eight dollars so that's really

2457.359 --> 2459.66
cheap

2465.46 --> 2470.32
right but yeah this is deep Earth

2467.619 --> 2473.38
crystal though

2470.32 --> 2476.52
or at least that's what Alex says

2473.38 --> 2476.52
so it's really pure

2477.4 --> 2481.54
but yeah maybe it's even cheaper out

2480.099 --> 2483.4
there maybe they figured out a way to

2481.54 --> 2484.72
make it really cheaply or something I

2483.4 --> 2487.42
don't know man

2484.72 --> 2488.4399999999996
I mean chemistry has come a very long

2487.42 --> 2490.599
way

2488.44 --> 2492.099
very very there's been a lot of

2490.599 --> 2496.44
development that

2492.099 --> 2496.44
are not super overt in your face

2498.46 --> 2502.38
but they are there anyway

2512.83 --> 2517.29
[Music]

2515.94 --> 2520.34
all right

2517.29 --> 2520.34
[Music]

2520.839 --> 2523.38
foreign

2531.24 --> 2535.1189999999997
sounds kind of like a rip-off if you ask

2533.68 --> 2538.359
me

2535.119 --> 2540.7000000000003
I mean that's gotta be one hell of a

2538.359 --> 2544.18
colloidal silver like what did they have

2540.7 --> 2547.06
like a hundred Buddhist monks

2544.18 --> 2548.68
pray to it or something I mean that

2547.06 --> 2551.14
might actually really work by the way

2548.68 --> 2553.359
but like why the hell would it be that

2551.14 --> 2555.5789999999997
expensive that's just weird

2553.359 --> 2560.0989999999997
that seems like a rip-off if there

2555.579 --> 2560.099
wasn't something really special about it

2566.2 --> 2572.2
oh providone Island's right yeah but

2569.5 --> 2574.359
that's just regular

2572.2 --> 2577.06
why'd I

2574.359 --> 2579.7
that's what they use for like uh the

2577.06 --> 2583.619
stuff you put on Band-Aids and [ __ ]

2579.7 --> 2583.6189999999997
I don't I don't use that

2585.28 --> 2590.44
by the way you can literally take this

2587.619 --> 2592.06
iodine and put it on a Band-Aid and it

2590.44 --> 2595.2400000000002
works fantastic

2592.06 --> 2598.98
you can apply that stuff topical as well

2595.24 --> 2598.9799999999996
but you can also consume it

2626.74 --> 2628.9799999999996
foreign

2637.38 --> 2641.04
and Bob okay

2657.099 --> 2659.6400000000003
foreign

2661.68 --> 2673.0099999999998
[Music]

2696.099 --> 2699.099
anyway

2699.64 --> 2705.2999999999997
yeah colloidal silver iodine works

2702.819 --> 2705.3
really well

2708.52 --> 2713.7
to care

2710.319 --> 2713.7
or for ingestion

2716.579 --> 2722.02
and yeah colloidal silver is

2719.5 --> 2726.66
is good enough that you can even just

2722.02 --> 2726.66
use it as a spray and breathe it in

2728.14 --> 2733.319
because it is actually really perfectly

2730.54 --> 2733.319
safe for that

2733.359 --> 2736.02
here

2740.98 --> 2746.44
honey is good yeah so I heard if it's

2743.38 --> 2750.48
actual pure honey and not like

2746.44 --> 2750.48
just sugary honey

2753.88 --> 2759.579
yeah raw honey yeah it can also be used

2756.7 --> 2762.54
used to heal wounds works really

2759.579 --> 2762.54
surprisingly well

2765.339 --> 2770.619
although if you do that in the middle of

2768.16 --> 2772.42
summer it can be a little problematic

2770.619 --> 2775.38
because you'll probably get all kinds of

2772.42 --> 2775.38
bugs after you

2775.72 --> 2778.3799999999997
uh

2795.04 --> 2798.52
but yeah in the past I've actually used

2797.2 --> 2802.74
honey

2798.52 --> 2802.74
to make wounds heal quicker

2802.839 --> 2809.7599999999998
well it was done to me like as a kid

2805.96 --> 2809.76
one time worked great great

2810.88 --> 2816.46
but like even with colloidal silver I've

2813.88 --> 2819.119
noticed that it literally makes wounds

2816.46 --> 2819.119
heal faster

2821.579 --> 2828.3590000000004
like twice as fast it speeds up the

2824.319 --> 2828.359
healing process like twice

2829.96 --> 2832.859
twice as fast

2834.02 --> 2837.5389999999998
[Music]

2851.319 --> 2856.54
foreign

2854.319 --> 2859.359
but yeah all of all those three things

2856.54 --> 2860.2
are basically pretty good combo and they

2859.359 --> 2861.819
are

2860.2 --> 2863.3799999999997
they don't get in each other's way

2861.819 --> 2865.839
chemically either

2863.38 --> 2868.3
so technically yeah you could use a

2865.839 --> 2870.46
combination of Honey colloidal silver

2868.3 --> 2872.38
and iodine

2870.46 --> 2873.7
and use that as some kind of a wound

2872.38 --> 2876.579
paste

2873.7 --> 2878.4399999999996
and you could even consume it

2876.579 --> 2881.619
right

2878.44 --> 2884.28
that would probably be an amazing

2881.619 --> 2884.28
self

2887.38 --> 2890.2200000000003
an ointment

2890.44 --> 2894.94
yeah itself is not a word in English

2893.02 --> 2896.68
that's the Dutch version sorry it's an

2894.94 --> 2899.2000000000003
ointment you could make an amazing

2896.68 --> 2902.2799999999997
ointment out of it just honey colloidal

2899.2 --> 2902.2799999999997
silver and iodine

2909.52 --> 2914.2599999999998
right have it like in a tube you could

2912.339 --> 2916.7799999999997
just make it put it in a tube and then

2914.26 --> 2919.1800000000003
just like squeeze it out

2916.78 --> 2920.619
rub it on a wound or put it on a

2919.18 --> 2923.7
Band-Aid

2920.619 --> 2923.7000000000003
or eat it

2927.6 --> 2933.42
[Music]

2929.819 --> 2933.42
mushrooms okay

2943.78 --> 2950.4
by the way I think that colloidal silver

2945.88 --> 2950.4
and honey would combine really well

2952.0 --> 2956.56
because while honey is an organic

2954.88 --> 2957.76
substance basically

2956.56 --> 2960.819
right

2957.76 --> 2962.98
and colloidal silver like honey can

2960.819 --> 2965.319
technically rot did you know that it can

2962.98 --> 2968.76
rot

2965.319 --> 2968.7599999999998
it was kind of weird like that

2968.8 --> 2973.599
but if you put colloidal still if you

2971.2 --> 2976.0
mix it up with colloidal silver I bet

2973.599 --> 2977.6800000000003
that that rotting is gonna be almost

2976.0 --> 2981.579
impossible

2977.68 --> 2985.359
because rotting is literally bacteria

2981.579 --> 2987.099
doing stuff and colloidal silver is yeah

2985.359 --> 2990.7599999999998
it's not gonna do that it's gonna

2987.099 --> 2993.969
prevent that from happening I bet

2990.76 --> 2993.969
[Music]

2999.9 --> 3006.7200000000003
it's my thoughts on CBD great

3003.599 --> 3008.28
I actually want to try that

3006.72 --> 3010.2599999999998
and the problem is it's kind of

3008.28 --> 3013.079
expensive but

3010.26 --> 3015.2400000000002
I want to try to see if I can stop

3013.079 --> 3018.1800000000003
smoking and still get

3015.24 --> 3020.4199999999996
yeah and still have the positive

3018.18 --> 3023.7
regeneration effects that come from

3020.42 --> 3026.2400000000002
Cannabis through CBD I want to try that

3023.7 --> 3026.24
at some point

3032.22 --> 3037.68
I mean the smoking works fine for me I

3035.46 --> 3040.44
guess especially with the carbon filters

3037.68 --> 3044.04
that I use but

3040.44 --> 3045.66
I mean it's not going to be forever at

3044.04 --> 3049.64
some point I'm just gonna be it's gonna

3045.66 --> 3049.64
be too detrimental to keep smoking

3050.339 --> 3055.68
ah

3053.23 --> 3060.2
[Music]

3055.68 --> 3060.2
but yeah I'm all for CBD absolutely

3064.079 --> 3070.7400000000002
I like like what I just mentioned right

3067.26 --> 3073.1400000000003
the like the colloidal silver iodine

3070.74 --> 3076.4399999999996
honey ointment

3073.14 --> 3079.3799999999997
well I figured out like like a golden

3076.44 --> 3081.3
pill like a pill that would be a

3079.38 --> 3083.7000000000003
combination of

3081.3 --> 3085.38
fish oil

3083.7 --> 3088.52
iodine

3085.38 --> 3088.52
and turmeric

3089.7 --> 3094.3799999999997
huh

3091.319 --> 3096.0589999999997
because those three also have like

3094.38 --> 3098.7000000000003
interactions

3096.059 --> 3101.8190000000004
and it would like those are like things

3098.7 --> 3104.0
you that are work well together all of

3101.819 --> 3104.0
it

3104.76 --> 3109.3190000000004
I like to think I don't know why I just

3107.16 --> 3110.52
like to think of like combination things

3109.319 --> 3112.859
like that

3110.52 --> 3115.2599999999998
I think it will work really well I mean

3112.859 --> 3117.7799999999997
at some point man at some point I might

3115.26 --> 3120.42
just like start a supplement line based

3117.78 --> 3123.6600000000003
on my ideas or something I kind of wish

3120.42 --> 3125.78
to do that but like I'm not even close

3123.66 --> 3129.24
to actually

3125.78 --> 3131.76
having the environment and setup

3129.24 --> 3133.9199999999996
necessarily to to Really achieve

3131.76 --> 3136.2000000000003
something with that

3133.92 --> 3137.94
because if I just go into retail it

3136.2 --> 3138.7799999999997
would be just like oh rebranding and

3137.94 --> 3140.76
just

3138.78 --> 3143.8190000000004
I wouldn't actually make a product

3140.76 --> 3147.38
making a product is much more like from

3143.819 --> 3147.38
scratch is much more complicated

3149.88 --> 3151.94
um

3157.14 --> 3161.819
okay

3159.42 --> 3163.92
bees flatter just trying to explain two

3161.819 --> 3166.319
flies Glory

3163.92 --> 3169.559
only truth is better than [ __ ] lies

3166.319 --> 3172.88
that's hilarious love being gas and that

3169.559 --> 3172.88
is really funny thank you for that

3177.3 --> 3185.42
oh really what is it okay that that will

3181.5 --> 3185.42
be great thanks that's cool

3198.72 --> 3203.819
correctly it lasts for yes

3201.42 --> 3205.6800000000003
I was just mentioning that it can

3203.819 --> 3209.94
technically rot

3205.68 --> 3213.2999999999997
but if I bet that if you put colloidal

3209.94 --> 3216.839
silver in there in the honey

3213.3 --> 3219.0
that is probably not gonna rot

3216.839 --> 3221.72
it would be interesting to actually have

3219.0 --> 3221.72
that tested

3229.02 --> 3235.98
right it might even be so great that

3232.74 --> 3237.7799999999997
it's like a thing to to change that like

3235.98 --> 3239.94
it might be a standard supplement even

3237.78 --> 3242.1600000000003
you'd call it silver honey or something

3239.94 --> 3243.7200000000003
because it's like now it's honey you can

3242.16 --> 3246.0
have it as pure as it wants and it

3243.72 --> 3247.98
doesn't rot and it has even more medical

3246.0 --> 3249.78
properties

3247.98 --> 3251.339
even though that would not be an

3249.78 --> 3252.8390000000004
official Claim about it of course

3251.339 --> 3254.5789999999997
because then

3252.839 --> 3257.839
you get the whole pharmaceutical

3254.579 --> 3257.8390000000004
industry on your back

3258.119 --> 3262.5
but people would know that just by using

3261.72 --> 3265.9399999999996
it

3262.5 --> 3270.48
you can like spread rumors word to mouth

3265.94 --> 3272.88
no make no official Claim about it

3270.48 --> 3274.859
but yeah silver honey like maybe that

3272.88 --> 3276.119
could be a thing

3274.859 --> 3278.46
like

3276.119 --> 3280.319
medicinal quality honey that you could

3278.46 --> 3284.599
use for wounds but

3280.319 --> 3284.599
with colloidal silver in it

3285.18 --> 3289.2
to make it even better and it's like

3287.099 --> 3291.839
it's not like that's gonna be expensive

3289.2 --> 3294.96
to even manufacture not at all

3291.839 --> 3296.7599999999998
to to add that bit

3294.96 --> 3300.859
is going to be much more Troublesome

3296.76 --> 3300.8590000000004
just to get good quality honey right

3322.02 --> 3326.7

3324.839 --> 3328.14
I don't know if it's gonna work out

3326.7 --> 3330.859

I yeah I'm not gonna go with that kind

3362.4 --> 3367.04
of lingo help and safety risks now

3370.4 --> 3375.619
vaping I don't I don't like vaping at

it's I can't sense what I'm ingesting

like I can't feel it

3382.8 --> 3386.1800000000003

3386.18 --> 3391.16

3397.079 --> 3403.619
and besides all those hazards and

3400.619 --> 3406.2000000000003
chemicals yeah well those carbon filters

3403.619 --> 3409.7000000000003
really go a long way

3406.2 --> 3413.5989999999997
to get those out without the good stuff

3409.7 --> 3413.5989999999997
also going out

3418.92 --> 3423.42
I really think that like carbon filters

3420.9 --> 3424.6800000000003
like that are the savior of regular

3423.42 --> 3426.359
smoking

3424.68 --> 3428.819
they really are

3426.359 --> 3431.46
in a way you should

3428.819 --> 3435.68
it should be considered from whatever

3431.46 --> 3435.68
perspective to standardize it

3441.18 --> 3448.16

3444.96 --> 3448.16
it will cost

3500.04 --> 3503.96
think it's a bit overblown though

3550.94 --> 3558.319
no but I don't smoke separately either

3553.92 --> 3558.319

3563.04 --> 3567.24
not a cigarette smoker or I don't roll

3569.64 --> 3574.98
smoking cannabis entirely yeah I smoked

3571.98 --> 3579.799
my cigarettes then

3574.98 --> 3579.799
but I don't typically do that

3581.099 --> 3584.839
I'm not that big a fan of smoking in

3584.839 --> 3590.099
like for myself it's not it's not really

3588.0 --> 3593.4
satisfying or anything usually it just

3590.099 --> 3595.079
makes my lint really cold just stifles

3593.4 --> 3596.339
my blood flow and I find that quite

3595.079 --> 3599.3390000000004

3626.46 --> 3631.319
tobacco is just a waste it doesn't have

3628.74 --> 3633.66
to be though I mean it is the tobacco we

3631.319 --> 3635.4
get from the stores

3633.66 --> 3637.98
right

3635.4 --> 3641.64
and those have all been processed in

3637.98 --> 3645.42
some way and stuff has been added

3641.64 --> 3649.2599999999998
if you buy the the leaves directly of a

3645.42 --> 3651.839
tobacco farm like I did like uh was it

3649.26 --> 3654.599
two years ago a couple of times

3651.839 --> 3657.24
that's a whole different game that's a

3654.599 --> 3659.54
different type of tobacco it's very

3657.24 --> 3659.54
different

3664.079 --> 3670.26
and it is actually enjoyable to just

3666.9 --> 3672.9
smoke a cigarette of that type of raw

3670.26 --> 3675.48
tobacco that's like unprocessed you have

3672.9 --> 3678.54
to cut it up yourself it it's almost

3675.48 --> 3682.559
like a you could just make cigars out of

3678.54 --> 3684.72
that because it's just really nice

3682.559 --> 3686.7000000000003
it's a very different game from regular

3684.72 --> 3688.68
cigarettes or even like

3686.7 --> 3691.319
tobacco pouches

3688.68 --> 3693.359
that are standardized

3691.319 --> 3696.18
it's an American Spirit one of the yeah

3693.359 --> 3699.48
that's that's actually I have American

3696.18 --> 3702.5989999999997
Spirit yeah they don't

3699.48 --> 3705.54
it's all just Brown Gray's packages now

3702.599 --> 3708.1800000000003
but yeah I I use American Spirit it is

3705.54 --> 3710.88
like the one that I can still handle

3708.18 --> 3712.5
like that's the only tobacco that I use

3710.88 --> 3715.1600000000003
from stores

3712.5 --> 3718.619
because all the others are really

3715.16 --> 3721.14
[ __ ] disgusting like really

3718.619 --> 3724.02
disgusting

3721.14 --> 3726.24
it really grosses me out the more

3724.02 --> 3728.78
typical tobacco that people smoke it

3726.24 --> 3728.7799999999997
really does

3734.22 --> 3739.02
it is less bad American Spirit is less

3736.799 --> 3741.14
bad than the other typical Brands out

3739.02 --> 3741.14
there

3743.76 --> 3748.46
it's the least process I think

3749.16 --> 3754.0789999999997
but yeah I mean if you just get the lead

3751.799 --> 3755.7599999999998
directly from the form that is

3754.079 --> 3756.8390000000004
unprocessed right that's the big

3755.76 --> 3760.7000000000003
difference

3756.839 --> 3760.7
that's just not process at all

[Music]

3780.299 --> 3783.02
foreign

3817.5 --> 3823.339
that's sounds like a bunch of hogwash

3820.98 --> 3823.339
really

3826.619 --> 3832.98
I think that there's been a lot of

3829.26 --> 3835.5
Overkill rumors about tobacco

3832.98 --> 3837.839
like they've absolutely demonized it

3835.5 --> 3839.7
like culturally mainstream if the

3837.839 --> 3842.04
mainstream is going to demonize

3839.7 --> 3844.02
something then you know there's

3842.04 --> 3846.359
something good about it

3844.02 --> 3849.619
okay

3846.359 --> 3849.619
that's how I see it

3856.859 --> 3861.299
and I think that there is actually

3858.66 --> 3864.8999999999996
something good about tobacco the problem

3861.299 --> 3868.04
is is that some people just get really

3864.9 --> 3868.04
addicted to it

3869.4 --> 3875.64
that's the problem with it

3872.579 --> 3879.38
but I think that using it actually has a

3875.64 --> 3879.3799999999997
beneficial influence like

3881.04 --> 3888.119
smokers are often calmer

3884.04 --> 3889.5589999999997
and it is knowing you people know that

3888.119 --> 3892.38
about it

3889.559 --> 3894.599
that it has like a focusing effect like

3892.38 --> 3896.88
it helps people focus like that's

3894.599 --> 3899.339
especially the first time or if you're

3896.88 --> 3903.359
not overwhelmed physically by it

3899.339 --> 3906.24
it is palpably helpful for focusing

3903.359 --> 3907.319
makes you concentrate more easily

3906.24 --> 3910.0789999999997
right

3907.319 --> 3912.18
but if you're really addicted then you

3910.079 --> 3915.119
can't concentrate without it that's the

3912.18 --> 3917.0989999999997
problem but on average it has a more

3915.119 --> 3920.04
focusing influence so you can

3917.099 --> 3923.099
statistically then size that up

3920.04 --> 3925.14
say that I think things are probably ran

3923.099 --> 3929.119
a little more smoothly

3925.14 --> 3929.1189999999997
when smoking was just kind of normal

3932.94 --> 3935.48
huh

3948.359 --> 3955.7599999999998
we are agents like that's [ __ ] Aries

3951.059 --> 3955.76
106. you know it don't do that to me

3955.799 --> 3963.319
yeah that nerve agent is not a common

3959.4 --> 3963.319
consumption good okay

3963.9 --> 3969.859
tobacco was

3966.0 --> 3969.859
a lot of people were smoking back then

3970.799 --> 3975.72
and yes in the far past it was

3973.319 --> 3978.48
ridiculous when doctors would recommend

3975.72 --> 3981.2
you get a smoke yeah that is absolutely

3978.48 --> 3981.2
absurd

3985.26 --> 3988.92
but I mean that is like 20th century

3987.72 --> 3992.4599999999996
[ __ ]

3988.92 --> 3995.96
because tobacco smoking was done

3992.46 --> 3995.96
for centuries

3998.28 --> 4000.88
okay

4012.98 --> 4017.02
so I'll get more medicinal reason yeah

4028.63 --> 4031.76
[Music]

4049.579 --> 4052.1800000000003
what

4060.14 --> 4067.64
okay so that stuff

4063.46 --> 4070.059
kills bacteria yeah why why why would

4067.64 --> 4070.0589999999997
you do that

4083.66 --> 4088.3999999999996
you do realize that those kinds of

4086.119 --> 4090.38
things basically hang around pretty much

4088.4 --> 4093.02
everywhere

4090.38 --> 4096.679
bacteria are floating in the air all the

4093.02 --> 4099.859
time all the time we're immersed in a

4096.679 --> 4101.96
giant invisible soup of bacteria at all

4099.859 --> 4103.819
times you get it

4101.96 --> 4106.9890000000005
it's everywhere all the time

4103.819 --> 4106.9890000000005
[Music]

4107.179 --> 4112.1
right

4108.799 --> 4114.759
you don't get anything unless your body

4112.1 --> 4114.759
weakens

4116.179 --> 4121.16
the body weakening is the reason for

4119.719 --> 4124.699
disease

4121.16 --> 4127.099999999999
not those bacteria

4124.699 --> 4130.04
it's circumstantial those bacteria are

4127.1 --> 4132.679
actually called to tasks

4130.04 --> 4136.239
when your body weakens like they have a

4132.679 --> 4136.2390000000005
function they're like laborers

4138.44 --> 4143.3589999999995
the whole idea like that of infection is

4141.859 --> 4145.04
just

4143.359 --> 4148.660000000001
getting a disease because of an

4145.04 --> 4148.66
infection it to me nonsense

4149.299 --> 4154.2789999999995
right

4151.04 --> 4156.56
only infections that are actually really

4154.279 --> 4158.719
dangerous are ones that happen

4156.56 --> 4161.120000000001
unnaturally like if you get a wound and

4158.719 --> 4164.06
it gets infected yeah that is actually

4161.12 --> 4167.9
problem that's where you should not have

4164.06 --> 4170.660000000001
external bacteria just popping in there

4167.9 --> 4172.099999999999
because it's an open wound that's very

4170.66 --> 4175.94
different

4172.1 --> 4177.92
from just general breathing and all that

4175.94 --> 4180.259
dude

4177.92 --> 4182.299
you're supposed to have that you're

4180.259 --> 4185.14
supposed to have that around

4182.299 --> 4185.14
that's normal

4205.04 --> 4208.4
they promote lots more water and much

4207.08 --> 4210.739
less salt

4208.4 --> 4214.36
yeah that

4210.739 --> 4214.36
I like salt a lot

4215.42 --> 4220.3
I eat a lot of salt

4217.52 --> 4220.3
it's good

4221.0 --> 4225.8
right as long as it's not refined table

4223.64 --> 4227.360000000001
salt crap

4225.8 --> 4229.58
because that stuff is extremely

4227.36 --> 4231.5
unhealthy but if you just take the

4229.58 --> 4235.34
normal type of salt

4231.5 --> 4239.08
with all the minerals it's great

4235.34 --> 4239.08
it's really good for you actually

4243.92 --> 4248.62
your body needs salt and minerals

4248.78 --> 4251.78
foreign

4269.5 --> 4273.679
yeah no [ __ ]

4271.76 --> 4277.34
I mean they've tried all kinds of things

4273.679 --> 4281.86
on all kinds of things but yeah

4277.34 --> 4281.860000000001
just experimenting with new things

4288.739 --> 4291.339999999999
foreign

4300.199 --> 4304.4
that all depends on what they even mean

4302.42 --> 4307.88
with radiation

4304.4 --> 4310.699
and intensity I mean yeah high in

4307.88 --> 4312.1990000000005
focused amounts of like radiation like

4310.699 --> 4314.54
that

4312.199 --> 4316.58
that is actually it's going to destroy

4314.54 --> 4318.199
yourselves or something but yeah a

4316.58 --> 4322.659
little bit I mean there's a little bit

4318.199 --> 4322.659
of radiation coming in with the sunlight

4323.96 --> 4328.96
because radiation is really like an

4326.12 --> 4328.96
extension of light

4335.0 --> 4337.719
mostly

4340.699 --> 4344.78
although yeah there's other forms of

4342.38 --> 4348.5
like radioactive radiation local what

4344.78 --> 4350.84
they call alpha beta radiation

4348.5 --> 4351.86
gamma radiation is really much more like

4350.84 --> 4353.900000000001
light

4351.86 --> 4357.219
but the alpha nibetas are different

4353.9 --> 4359.78
that's like a molecular thing that's

4357.219 --> 4362.84
allegedly happening

4359.78 --> 4364.88
now how detrimental that is dude I don't

4362.84 --> 4367.1
know man I really don't know I'm not

4364.88 --> 4369.8
saying it's good for you

4367.1 --> 4372.679
but I'm saying that

4369.8 --> 4375.92
it's widely misunderstood and I do not

4372.679 --> 4379.64
really trust like uh what do you call a

4375.92 --> 4382.6
nuclear physics in that sense

4379.64 --> 4385.280000000001
like the lore about supposed

4382.6 --> 4387.88
radioactivity I don't really trust it

4385.28 --> 4387.88
all that much

4396.32 --> 4402.0199999999995
yeah I'm not gonna go with oh radiation

4398.9 --> 4404.599999999999
is good now I just don't think it's as

4402.02 --> 4408.400000000001
harmful as they say it is

4404.6 --> 4408.400000000001
in certain circumstances

4415.87 --> 4419.0689999999995
[Music]

4425.9 --> 4430.5199999999995
think pink Himalayan sea salt is the

4428.12 --> 4432.32
best from what I've heard well flutter

4430.52 --> 4433.76
Sage yeah well it used to be kind of

4432.32 --> 4436.28
good but

4433.76 --> 4439.219
because it had amazing minerals in it

4436.28 --> 4441.62
but apparently they no longer do that

4439.219 --> 4442.34
they extract most of the minerals out

4441.62 --> 4444.86
now

4442.34 --> 4448.219
probably to sell it separately as

4444.86 --> 4452.12
supplements to make even more money

4448.219 --> 4454.659
so yeah the or like raw

4452.12 --> 4457.82
Himalayan sea salt

4454.659 --> 4461.299999999999
unprocessed that is amazing stuff

4457.82 --> 4463.639999999999
fortunately we don't really get the raw

4461.3 --> 4466.78
stuff in the stores anymore this China

4463.64 --> 4466.780000000001
doesn't sell that

4468.38 --> 4473.900000000001
they take a lot of it out now

4471.8 --> 4477.7390000000005
so I've actually switched away from

4473.9 --> 4480.04
Himalayan say so the words uh it's the

4477.739 --> 4480.04
other one

4482.42 --> 4489.679
yeah Celtic seesaw

4486.32 --> 4492.92
it's it's the one from Normandy I think

4489.679 --> 4495.92
that's where they get that stuff but

4492.92 --> 4498.1990000000005
it's another one and that is still has

4495.92 --> 4501.1990000000005
all those minerals in it it's just a bit

4498.199 --> 4503.719
weird because it's like slightly wet

4501.199 --> 4504.799999999999
just won't stop being wet it's really

4503.719 --> 4506.3
weird

4504.8 --> 4509.4400000000005
but good

4506.3 --> 4509.4400000000005
so I switched

4519.98 --> 4524.32
right so yeah Pinko Himalayan sea salt

4522.5 --> 4528.739
was probably

4524.32 --> 4531.98
really good roughly up to

4528.739 --> 4536.0
like 2010 or somewhere there

4531.98 --> 4537.739
and then it was like a a lure in right

4536.0 --> 4539.3
it was like an advertisement like oh

4537.739 --> 4541.879999999999
look this stuff we give you the best

4539.3 --> 4543.860000000001
salt in the world

4541.88 --> 4547.58
but

4543.86 --> 4550.599999999999
now it isn't that quality anymore

4547.58 --> 4550.6
that's what I heard

4552.08 --> 4555.86
through my healer by the way

4554.239 --> 4559.659
take his

4555.86 --> 4559.659
recommendations very serious

4573.86 --> 4576.46
foreign

4590.3 --> 4595.4800000000005
how far is the sea from Heavenly what

4595.82 --> 4598.719
very far

4606.02 --> 4611.4800000000005
I mean the Himalayas are literally

4608.0 --> 4613.52
surrounded by countries

4611.48 --> 4615.08
I think the shortest distance from the

4613.52 --> 4618.679
himalayans

4615.08 --> 4620.86
to the ocean are is like Bangladesh or

4618.679 --> 4620.86
something

4626.32 --> 4632.0199999999995
but that's still a pretty damn big swath

4629.3 --> 4632.02
of land so

4633.38 --> 4636.43
[Music]

4644.78 --> 4647.0199999999995
foreign

4647.14 --> 4652.56
of gold in the Congo no it sounds like

4651.02 --> 4655.629000000001
[ __ ]

4652.56 --> 4655.629000000001
[Music]

4666.56 --> 4673.179
if there is no C where does this sea

4669.679 --> 4673.179
salt come from

4673.94 --> 4679.659
yeah

4675.86 --> 4679.659
that's a good question isn't it

4680.92 --> 4684.4
okay sorry

4684.46 --> 4689.36
I'm not super familiar with all the

4687.679 --> 4691.46
names of the countries over there

4689.36 --> 4695.259999999999
surrounding India and all that there

4691.46 --> 4695.26
it's so excuse me

4701.84 --> 4707.32
I don't I've never even heard of Bhutan

4705.08 --> 4709.88
to be fair

4707.32 --> 4711.5
that doesn't ring a bell to me so I must

4709.88 --> 4714.38
have completely overlooked that whatever

4711.5 --> 4719.3
anyway when I was like browsing through

4714.38 --> 4721.400000000001
maps and topography and all that uh

4719.3 --> 4723.76
I didn't just look it up I went all by

4721.4 --> 4723.759999999999
memory

4726.14 --> 4732.679
yeah but anyway the whole C where did it

4728.9 --> 4732.679
come from yeah well

4732.92 --> 4738.86
it's there there might have been a

4735.38 --> 4741.56
massive Salt Lake perhaps

4738.86 --> 4743.12
all those things might be remnants of

4741.56 --> 4746.780000000001
the flood

4743.12 --> 4750.32
right giant sea water everywhere

4746.78 --> 4752.0599999999995
Landing in relatively high places like a

4750.32 --> 4756.159
lake and then

4752.06 --> 4756.159000000001
they dry up and leave the salt

4757.1 --> 4764.14
that's a conceivable way I can figure

4759.92 --> 4764.14
out and how that salt ended up there

4766.83 --> 4769.88
[Music]

4780.5 --> 4785.14
oh

4782.54 --> 4785.14
right

4829.159 --> 4831.82
right

4834.739 --> 4840.98
I mean Aries 106 if you have an

4836.84 --> 4842.6
alternative as to why those salt layers

4840.98 --> 4844.159
ended up there

4842.6 --> 4847.719
would like to know if you have an

4844.159 --> 4847.719
alternative to yeah the flood

4848.0 --> 4850.42
right

4852.92 --> 4855.9400000000005
hey Nature Boy

4855.98 --> 4858.879999999999
good to see you

4892.34 --> 4898.659000000001
nothing then Aries 106. you're just

4895.88 --> 4898.659000000001
gonna leave it there

4903.09 --> 4906.149
[Music]

4908.42 --> 4913.42
the sea salt in the name of marketing

4915.679 --> 4921.02
no I'm pretty sure that

4918.5 --> 4923.14
they actually think it is originally sea

4921.02 --> 4923.14
salt

4932.96 --> 4937.36
so let's see so is it

4940.58 --> 4946.699
yeah but it's not really like rock salt

4944.12 --> 4948.5
like salt that's just in between Rock

4946.699 --> 4951.919999999999
it's literally

4948.5 --> 4954.8
a lot of salt it's it's very pure

4951.92 --> 4957.88
actually over there turret so I wouldn't

4954.8 --> 4957.88
call it rock salt

4957.92 --> 4962.42
it's

4959.3 --> 4965.6
like really pure salt

4962.42 --> 4968.42
like enough to make it look pink and

4965.6 --> 4971.659000000001
transparent by itself naturally

4968.42 --> 4975.58
with some mineral like more Rocky stuff

4971.659 --> 4975.58
like in between that also but

4975.86 --> 4984.04
even from like the digging sites there

4979.699 --> 4984.04
it just looks really pure

4991.58 --> 4996.1
so is it wrong is that rock salt really

4996.62 --> 5003.219
I mean there is like rock Rocky places

5000.52 --> 5005.580000000001
where literally the salt is inside of

5003.219 --> 5005.58
the rock

5006.159 --> 5011.86
so it's like salty rocks but I don't

5008.5 --> 5013.54
think that the Himalaya salt situation

5011.86 --> 5016.0
is like that

5013.54 --> 5018.88
they don't extract it from The Rock it's

5016.0 --> 5020.32
literally they're up for scooping

5018.88 --> 5023.219
they just

5020.32 --> 5023.219
dig it out

5045.1 --> 5050.820000000001
sodium chloride the head tight rock salt

5048.219 --> 5050.82
hmm

5064.02 --> 5070.3
tectonics explains really

5069.1 --> 5071.679
what

5070.3 --> 5075.4800000000005
what how

5071.679 --> 5075.4800000000005
does it explain that

5075.64 --> 5080.08
if you're gonna go by tectonics right

5077.739 --> 5082.78
plates pushing it and oh look the one

5080.08 --> 5085.739
goes like this or they go like this well

5082.78 --> 5089.38
then there would be

5085.739 --> 5091.718999999999
diagonal faces of salt

5089.38 --> 5093.34
yes

5091.719 --> 5097.14
it isn't

5093.34 --> 5100.1990000000005
guess guess what those Himalayan salt

5097.14 --> 5103.900000000001
mines look like huh

5100.199 --> 5108.339999999999
flat they're flat they dig it out flat

5103.9 --> 5110.92
the salt is laid on a flat surface

5108.34 --> 5114.34
so not tectonics

5110.92 --> 5117.64
it's not being pushed up

5114.34 --> 5120.04
because that makes no sense no no the

5117.64 --> 5122.9400000000005
salt deposited

5120.04 --> 5122.94
flat

5123.1 --> 5128.9800000000005
it didn't form

5125.76 --> 5131.320000000001
billions of years ago and then was

5128.98 --> 5133.718999999999
pushed up to turn into a mountain

5131.32 --> 5137.739
because then there would be diagonal

5133.719 --> 5139.2390000000005
salt lines salt surfaces there that's

5137.739 --> 5141.4
not what it is

5139.239 --> 5146.0199999999995
they're not scooping it off the side of

5141.4 --> 5150.299999999999
diagonal faces No it's uh like deposited

5146.02 --> 5150.3
and dried up on a flat plane

5154.3 --> 5157.84
Himalayan Waters used to be underway

5156.34 --> 5161.639
yeah yeah yeah it's called The Great

5157.84 --> 5161.639
Flood indeed

5161.92 --> 5166.179
yeah but the Himalayan Mountains the

5164.38 --> 5169.36
real mountain peaks and all that they're

5166.179 --> 5173.56
not covered by salt they're not salty

5169.36 --> 5175.599999999999
ah Ares 106. did you know that

5173.56 --> 5178.06
it's not like your client the Mount

5175.6 --> 5180.639
Everest is not just a giant salty

5178.06 --> 5182.9800000000005
Mountain it's not what it is no the salt

5180.639 --> 5185.04
was deposited

5182.98 --> 5187.839999999999
in between

5185.04 --> 5191.639
the mountain peaks

5187.84 --> 5191.639
in the valleys

5191.679 --> 5198.1
on top of the dirt

5194.56 --> 5200.8
right so when the flood happened water

5198.1 --> 5203.679
stayed in there the heaviest [ __ ] went

5200.8 --> 5205.659000000001
down the dirt and then the salt

5203.679 --> 5208.36
and the salt water was left it

5205.659 --> 5210.879999999999
evaporated and then left a salt layer on

5208.36 --> 5213.04
top of that flat dirt

5210.88 --> 5216.6990000000005
yeah

5213.04 --> 5219.5199999999995
it wasn't there before the mountains

5216.699 --> 5221.919999999999
formed it's ridiculous dude that's

5219.52 --> 5222.9400000000005
illogical it's an illogical train of

5221.92 --> 5225.9400000000005
thinking

5222.94 --> 5228.159
it's obviously deposited after the

5225.94 --> 5229.0
mountains had already attained their

5228.159 --> 5231.839999999999
shape

5229.0 --> 5231.84
obviously

5243.699 --> 5246.419999999999
whoa

5252.76 --> 5256.26
wow that's trippy man

5258.1 --> 5262.4400000000005
that is really trippy that picture

5262.78 --> 5269.219
I literally just made a building inside

5264.88 --> 5269.219
of it that's bizarre man

5281.62 --> 5285.76
hello by the way welcome back says

5283.3 --> 5288.78
Moretz

5289.239 --> 5291.48

5295.3 --> 5297.54
man

5311.26 --> 5314.92
I mean seriously what am I going to call

5313.0 --> 5317.46
this show we're talking about so many

5314.92 --> 5317.46
different things

5317.86 --> 5320.86
substances

5326.52 --> 5332.820000000001
started with

5328.44 --> 5332.82
colloid those silver

5334.84 --> 5337.84
iodine

5338.44 --> 5343.259999999999
honey

5340.659 --> 5343.259999999999
salt

5343.3 --> 5346.320000000001
did I miss anything

5348.46 --> 5352.97
tobacco

5350.62 --> 5357.749
oh wait no uh CBD

5352.97 --> 5357.749000000001
[Music]

5360.34 --> 5362.9400000000005
foreign

5363.66 --> 5371.479
[Music]

5374.51 --> 5377.76
[Music]

5390.58 --> 5393.3
okay

5401.739 --> 5407.138999999999
did I miss anything

5404.38 --> 5409.92
tobacco insults now I'm making a whole

5407.139 --> 5409.92
list out of it

5412.3 --> 5416.4400000000005
call it Himalaya yeah but it isn't rock

5414.1 --> 5421.1990000000005
salt turret it isn't you're just wrong

5416.44 --> 5421.199
it is sea salt it's not rock salt

5430.12 --> 5433.12
foreign

5434.88 --> 5440.32
ER earlier in chat explained exactly the

5438.58 --> 5442.179
difference

5440.32 --> 5444.34
it's a different rock salt is a

5442.179 --> 5448.26
different type of salt that's not

5444.34 --> 5448.26
what Himalayan salt is

5448.6 --> 5453.159000000001
classified sea salt because it's not

5451.239 --> 5456.339999999999
rock salt that's a different type of

5453.159 --> 5456.339999999999
salt situation

5456.52 --> 5461.679
so I'm not going to call it Himalayan

5458.56 --> 5464.56
rock salt it isn't it's sea salt even

5461.679 --> 5467.4400000000005
though might be disputed like how it got

5464.56 --> 5470.04
there it's not the type of salt to call

5467.44 --> 5470.04
it rock salt

5472.6 --> 5477.34
of the earth that's a good one too but

5475.239 --> 5482.099999999999
I'm calling it colloidal silver iodine

5477.34 --> 5482.1
honey CBD tobacco sea salt and more

5483.639 --> 5491.34
I think that kind of sums it up doesn't

5486.04 --> 5491.34
it in the order of appearance too

5503.199 --> 5508.5599999999995
how come salt in the ocean wasn't

5505.96 --> 5508.56
mentioned

5513.04 --> 5519.58
Checkmate why is that Checkmate I mean

5516.659 --> 5523.48
I'm pretty sure they

5519.58 --> 5527.62
didn't mention about fleas

5523.48 --> 5529.959999999999
or something right or ticks

5527.62 --> 5531.46
does that mean that that's a Checkmate

5529.96 --> 5533.7390000000005
because there is something out there

5531.46 --> 5536.76
that wasn't mentioned in the Bible

5533.739 --> 5536.759999999999
I mean hello

5537.76 --> 5546.360000000001
isn't I mean oceans have always been

5541.239 --> 5546.36
salty as far as We Know

5546.76 --> 5550.900000000001
as far as any kind of historical

5549.1 --> 5552.04
reference

5550.9 --> 5555.58
right

5552.04 --> 5559.179
so why would you mention it's like oh

5555.58 --> 5562.659
yeah the sun comes up every day like oh

5559.179 --> 5564.82
really really wow wow thanks for telling

5562.659 --> 5567.46
me I kind of figured that out myself by

5564.82 --> 5569.259999999999
just existing

5567.46 --> 5572.08
being top side

5569.26 --> 5573.639
right not living in a cave my entire

5572.08 --> 5575.32
life then yeah you can figure that out

5573.639 --> 5577.42
why would you mention that in the book

5575.32 --> 5582.12
that oh oh yeah guys this the salt is

5577.42 --> 5582.12
actually the sea is salt like duh

5582.159 --> 5586.259999999999
I don't know why would they have to

5583.719 --> 5586.26
mention that

5596.139 --> 5600.6990000000005
I think they knew where the salt came

5597.88 --> 5602.5
well obviously I mean if there was water

5600.699 --> 5605.739
and then Earth with all the minerals

5602.5 --> 5608.86
it's very likely that the minerals then

5605.739 --> 5612.099999999999
started to dissolve in the ocean

5608.86 --> 5614.86
or well in the waters

5612.1 --> 5617.4400000000005
right in the waters of creation

5614.86 --> 5620.98
to then turn it into the ocean like the

5617.44 --> 5623.86
mineral rich and salty

5620.98 --> 5626.919999999999
stuff that it has become that's probably

5623.86 --> 5629.0199999999995
because of yeah the Earth

5626.92 --> 5630.159
the Earth at it and all the minerals in

5629.02 --> 5632.860000000001
it

5630.159 --> 5634.96
but I mean why would they have to say

5632.86 --> 5637.239
that in the Bible like oh yeah and and

5634.96 --> 5640.36
the oceans are soft and the rivers are

5637.239 --> 5643.299999999999
sweet like okay

5640.36 --> 5645.4
and who knows man maybe there's like uh

5643.3 --> 5647.1990000000005
Bible outtakes right the books that

5645.4 --> 5651.339999999999
weren't added in the

5647.199 --> 5653.86
nician Council Originals that were

5651.34 --> 5655.900000000001
actually making mention of that right so

5653.86 --> 5658.739
you're just saying oh it's not in there

5655.9 --> 5658.739
how do you know

5659.32 --> 5663.179
how do you know that for sure even

5667.56 --> 5674.860000000001
I would have to mention it in Genesis

5671.26 --> 5678.280000000001
I mean in Genesis they mentioned all the

5674.86 --> 5680.38
animals yeah they didn't mean name all

5678.28 --> 5681.94
the animals in Genesis does that mean oh

5680.38 --> 5684.34
Checkmate you didn't name all the

5681.94 --> 5686.0199999999995
animals yeah because

5684.34 --> 5688.06
I don't know they didn't feel like

5686.02 --> 5692.1990000000005
adding

5688.06 --> 5693.9400000000005
like 20 pages of just naming all the

5692.199 --> 5696.879999999999
animals that weren't even discovered and

5693.94 --> 5698.44
named yet back then

5696.88 --> 5704.04
I mean Genesis you got to realize

5698.44 --> 5704.04
Genesis was not written by Adam okay

5704.199 --> 5709.5
it wasn't written by people that were

5706.54 --> 5709.5
literally there

5715.84 --> 5722.04
anyway I'm gonna round out the cell the
