[Music]

24.7 --> 37.079
[Music]

50.59 --> 52.650000000000006
you

93.17 --> 103.01
I was muted right good morning welcome

102.2 --> 106.88
to Flat Earth

103.01 --> 109.67
early-bird number 136 I'm your host

106.88 --> 111.89
Arwen as I just showed you before the

109.67 --> 116.54
day is kind of grey it's not cold though

111.89 --> 118.63
and it's not rainy and I've been having

116.54 --> 124.81
a lot of internet connection problems

118.63 --> 124.81
and also I forgot to unmute my mic so

129.25 --> 136.33
but yeah the connection has been

131.98 --> 136.32999999999998
disrupting and I think it's probably a

136.48 --> 143.98899999999998
it's either like a weird accidental

140.38 --> 146.06
electric feedback situation with the

143.989 --> 149.239
type of electric tension that is on the

146.06 --> 153.019
electric grid through which my internet

149.239 --> 156.41
connection is routed landline through

153.019 --> 159.17000000000002
the electricity net and yeah it does

156.41 --> 164.87
work usually until it kind of gets

159.17 --> 166.51899999999998
disrupted a lot yeah I know you guys can

164.87 --> 170.299
hear me very funny

166.519 --> 179.45000000000002
I can hear me if you can't hear me then

170.299 --> 182.03
unmute the page but yeah today just I

179.45 --> 186.36999999999998
got disrupted in half an hour five times

182.03 --> 186.37
in a row so they're very aggravating

189.52 --> 195.24
[Music]

191.45 --> 200.1
and then there's the Google Hangouts

195.24 --> 201.33
issues which keep on for no apparent

200.1 --> 207.48
reason at all

201.33 --> 211.68
suddenly disrupt the the sound input I

207.48 --> 214.10999999999999
get from the other panelists so the the

211.68 --> 216.9
sound just falls away just becomes

214.11 --> 220.01000000000002
silent and then suddenly can be turned

216.9 --> 223.41
on again or certain channels remain

220.01 --> 225.57
unmuted by this effect while others are

223.41 --> 229.32
so you get this asymmetrical

225.57 --> 232.07999999999998
conversations it's very aggravating and

229.32 --> 237.76999999999998
in that sense Google Hangouts has become

232.08 --> 237.77
completely useless to me completely

238.16 --> 242.69
how do lo really

246.9 --> 249.8
- loud

259.139 --> 263.0
and scratchy feedback

268.069 --> 280.40000000000003
okay I don't know why okay Nathan stop

277.02 --> 280.4
it it's not funny

288.45 --> 295.44
it's really very annoying yours I don't

293.41 --> 300.61
do that kind of [ __ ] on your panel okay

295.44 --> 302.91
so don't do that in my chat please yeah

300.61 --> 302.91
good

306.83 --> 316.12
uh okay let's see what I've been doing

313.55 --> 316.12
yesterday

322.15 --> 329.169
oh yeah I went over to Jose's again I

324.729 --> 332.889
think but yeah Google started to fail on

329.169 --> 334.9
me again so I tried to get on his panel

332.889 --> 339.43
through Skype and he did accept my call

334.9 --> 342.07
but yeah he said he couldn't continue

339.43 --> 344.56
the sound on both the panel and the

342.07 --> 351.59999999999997
Skype call so yeah it was completely

344.56 --> 354.43
useless as a result now I feel kind of

351.6 --> 358.389
unsatisfied it's really annoying because

354.43 --> 364.75
I feel like I've been being disrupted

358.389 --> 370.63
out of the debates and I really don't

364.75 --> 373.479
know what to do about it and if this

370.63 --> 375.96
gets worse then eventually I'll have no

373.479 --> 378.28
choice but to just drop off the scene

375.96 --> 382.10999999999996
because everything is getting disrupted

378.28 --> 382.10999999999996
and I can't participate anymore

385.24 --> 389.37
so yeah

389.52 --> 403.00899999999996
Skype is still functioning though anyone

398.129 --> 403.009
who wants to call in that will be great

403.129 --> 411.90000000000003
yeah Randy it's yeah it's great great

408.96 --> 417.93
advice man yourself up but yeah I can

411.9 --> 421.73999999999995
man myself up all I like but yeah if I

417.93 --> 424.289
can't normally debate other people

421.74 --> 426.389
because I can barely follow what's going

424.289 --> 430.77
on because the sound is being disrupted

426.389 --> 431.43
constantly how there's nothing I can do

430.77 --> 434.06899999999996
anymore

431.43 --> 439.02
I can't participate in conversations

434.069 --> 441.12
okay you can man up all I like I'm just

439.02 --> 446.37
getting screwed I don't know what to do

441.12 --> 449.669
about this and my options are already

446.37 --> 453.389
kind of limited even trying the Hangout

449.669 --> 457.889
system through Internet Explorer and I

453.389 --> 460.219
don't want to go and try out Chrome at

457.889 --> 460.219
all

461.47 --> 467.89000000000004
I don't know Daniel why the sound is

463.78 --> 470.04999999999995
being disrupted it just is I sit in the

467.89 --> 473.74
panel and then suddenly the sound just

470.05 --> 477.34000000000003
turns off like somebody's interrupting

473.74 --> 480.07
the connection and it's just silent out

477.34 --> 482.89
there no activity no sound and then

480.07 --> 484.36
suddenly somebody may start in the

482.89 --> 489.82
middle of the conversation become

484.36 --> 493.26
audible again and it's totally totally

489.82 --> 493.26
unpredictable how that works

506.91 --> 509.81
what kind of

510.419 --> 515.99
why are you saying something like that

512.519 --> 515.99
that's just ridiculous

541.49 --> 546.2
caryn be our I would that make a

544.08 --> 546.2
difference

546.43 --> 550.2399999999999
[Music]

553.94 --> 558.24
yeah look memory it's not gonna be a

556.35 --> 563.58
problem I have a huge amount of memory

558.24 --> 569.899
on my computer but I don't want to use

563.58 --> 569.899
Chrome because it's it's an evil Google

570.17 --> 578.5799999999999
system it's I don't like it I don't want

576.42 --> 581.3389999999999
I've been avoiding Chrome

578.58 --> 583.61
since it came out and I don't want to go

581.339 --> 583.61
there

601.73 --> 604.4490000000001
all right

610.95 --> 614.239
[Music]

614.7 --> 618.7700000000001
now Daniel not any other browser can

617.73 --> 624.2
work

618.77 --> 628.0699999999999
you can't even try it out on Firefox

624.2 --> 628.07
just doesn't accept it

641.66 --> 646.039
[Music]

649.12 --> 656.38
[Music]

652.08 --> 659.35
all right well okay maybe I guess I will

656.38 --> 661.33
try out Chrome then after all these

659.35 --> 663.01
years of avoiding it like the plague

661.33 --> 673.6
what's next they're gonna force me to

663.01 --> 677.8199999999999
join facebook as well I I just I don't

673.6 --> 677.82
like to be railroaded like this

694.41 --> 697.559
[Music]

715.4 --> 723.61
I should have taken that wrench away

719.6 --> 723.61
from you months ago

749.43 --> 761.2299999999999
yeah anyway I will try this freakin

755.019 --> 763.689
Chrome [ __ ] just look I even didn't

761.23 --> 766.48
really like using Internet Explorer at

763.689 --> 768.3389999999999
all avoided at all costs but it was the

766.48 --> 771.4300000000001
only thing that was standard installed

768.339 --> 773.769
on this computer that could even carry

771.43 --> 778.41
Google Hangouts so that's literally the

773.769 --> 781.36
only thing I ever used it for but I

778.41 --> 786.91
guess I'm gonna be forced to use Chrome

781.36 --> 790.1800000000001
goody more freakin corporatists computer

786.91 --> 792.73
world social media railroading oh this

790.18 --> 795.1289999999999
doesn't work anymore you have to use the

792.73 --> 797.879
one monolithic thing out there that

795.129 --> 803.309
everyone using is tapped into everything

797.879 --> 803.309
leeching all data from you great

804.12 --> 814.42
like not looking forward I don't like

810.639 --> 817.5
being railroaded into singular software

814.42 --> 820.389
where is the time of all the options

817.5 --> 823.569
remember of when there were browsers all

820.389 --> 825.759
over the place and they weren't all

823.569 --> 827.8789999999999
owned by a single freaking company in

825.759 --> 827.879
the world

832.93 --> 840.92
yeah Linux yeah I never got never get

837.86 --> 846.98
used to that always been thinking like

840.92 --> 849.62
yeah should try it out but I don't know

846.98 --> 851.269
I I still stick even to Windows 7

849.62 --> 858.079
because I just don't want to move beyond

851.269 --> 861.829
that I think this this type of yeah this

858.079 --> 865.25
type of computer system that software

861.829 --> 870.68
setup is just ideal for what I want

865.25 --> 874.639
I don't want more new [ __ ] don't want to

870.68 --> 878.18
be manipulated through the interface

874.639 --> 880.63
into a certain type of acting I don't

878.18 --> 880.63
like that

893.64 --> 896.959
now Randy is

900.34 --> 905.44
it's just bad timing okay there's the

903.16 --> 907.4499999999999
thing about comedy and that's timing so

905.44 --> 910.9000000000001
yeah you may be thinking this is all

907.45 --> 913.51
very hilarious at my expense but I'm not

910.9 --> 915.91
amused at being cut off and having

913.51 --> 924.27
internet [ __ ] shitty problems all the

915.91 --> 928.29
time so yeah it's just not funny

924.27 --> 928.29
I'm not in the mood for it

935.35 --> 938.539
[Music]

940.57 --> 943.32
right

983.04 --> 985.88
huh

997.34 --> 1002.19
okay well I'm installing it great

1009.81 --> 1016.899
maybe I'm just being old and rusty and

1013.24 --> 1019.39
stubborn I just don't like being forced

1016.899 --> 1023.459
to start using some other type of

1019.39 --> 1023.459
software I I never liked it

1030.12 --> 1037.819
please stop perpetuating the joke

1033.72 --> 1041.929
grantee please

1037.819 --> 1041.9289999999999

okay okay Randy I guess it I'm in a bad

1091.84 --> 1096.6299999999999
mood I think just misunderstanding it

1097.169 --> 1102.929
okay all right

1108.26 --> 1111.26
mmm

1114.72 --> 1121.55

1118.13 --> 1121.5500000000002
interface works

1131.01 --> 1143.049
anyway I'll not do that during the show

1134.64 --> 1151.1200000000001
it's just too annoying so anyway thanks

1179.11 --> 1182.31
[Music]

1182.62 --> 1188.84
yep

1184.65 --> 1188.8400000000001
I can't even see what he said

1199.53 --> 1215.61
okay well see you later Steve anyway

1207.09 --> 1222.24

1215.61 --> 1225.35
what the [ __ ] what's rude I didn't see

1222.24 --> 1225.35
what they wrote

1230.37 --> 1233.87
now for [ __ ] sake

1236.91 --> 1243.96
right the troll okay he was rude okay

1242.01 --> 1245.58
I'll take your word for it but I didn't

1243.96 --> 1258.24
actually get a chance to see what they

1245.58 --> 1262.9199999999998
wrote that's a mess yeah if if anyone

1258.24 --> 1266.34
wants to join my panel or in this case

1262.92 --> 1269.21
just joined through Skype it looks

1266.34 --> 1269.2099999999998
something like this

1269.24 --> 1276.03
so yeah cutter I finally got the

1272.34 --> 1278.4299999999998
dimensions right on the screen so yeah I

1276.03 --> 1281.6
can just have Skype calls there hey I'll

1278.43 --> 1284.73
even be up to this debate ballers

1281.6 --> 1286.9699999999998
totally ready pretty much ready for

1284.73 --> 1286.97
anything

1290.029 --> 1297.679
because the oddness panel vacuum is just

1293.659 --> 1297.679
it's kind of wearing me down

1309.01 --> 1316.09
all right

1311.65 --> 1319.63
yeah and also I'm trying to cut down a

1316.09 --> 1326.83
little on just the troll baiting cuz

1319.63 --> 1330.4
it's not doing me any favors and ya can

1326.83 --> 1332.71
be kind of funny at times but in times

1330.4 --> 1333.8500000000001
when I don't feel all that strong and

1332.71 --> 1335.95
everything it just becomes really

1333.85 --> 1338.8
disruptive and I think it's rubbing off

1335.95 --> 1342.28
on you guys it's just not good for the

1338.8 --> 1348.6399999999999
atmosphere so I'm just trying to calm

1342.28 --> 1351.22
the [ __ ] down and just let the freakin

1348.64 --> 1353.6200000000001
trolls do their shitty thing as long as

1351.22 --> 1355.89
they don't get disgusting then it's all

1353.62 --> 1355.8899999999999
fine

1361.93 --> 1373.69
huh wow that's pretty cool thing to say

1367.0 --> 1376.98
actually Daniel to admit that was nice

1373.69 --> 1383.98
MacLeod what are you what are you on

1376.98 --> 1387.15
your derping [ __ ] anyway yeah to admit

1383.98 --> 1389.5
that you have heavy social anxiety I

1387.15 --> 1392.0800000000002
would reckon something like that

1389.5 --> 1395.74
especially with the hyperactive nough

1392.08 --> 1399.6699999999998
said you seem to debate yeah that

1395.74 --> 1402.61
doesn't surprise me at all so but it's

1399.67 --> 1406.54
pretty good of you to just be able to

1402.61 --> 1410.8
admit that so respect and yeah hopefully

1406.54 --> 1415.48
you will at one day yeah join my panel

1410.8 --> 1420.94
and have a debate voice the voice set up

1415.48 --> 1423.91
through the chat always don't know if do

1420.94 --> 1426.22
you ever even debate face to face about

1423.91 --> 1429.5700000000002
these kind of things or is it just

1426.22 --> 1432.28
through the internet through chat

1429.57 --> 1435.1799999999998
because you're you're pretty fast typer

1432.28 --> 1435.18
from what I've seen

1441.97 --> 1449.769
no thanks P Mars yeah I'm pretty happy

1444.37 --> 1453.0
with my new mic as well it's it's a lot

1449.769 --> 1453.0
bigger and heavier though

1465.44 --> 1468.01
yeah

1477.42 --> 1486.24
all right good to know Daniel although I

1481.65 --> 1492.42
think the niceness of the community on

1486.24 --> 1495.44
this Court is debatable I'm being very

1492.42 --> 1495.44
euphemistic there

1495.83 --> 1500.78
[Music]

1513.27 --> 1522.29
hmm right well hey if Pete Mars wants to

1517.62 --> 1522.29
talk to me over Skype sure why not

1528.9 --> 1532.91
you know is even on skype

1546.59 --> 1554.8799999999999
really really a smoke out is a it's a

1550.289 --> 1559.86
trap a trap for what getting called on

1554.88 --> 1562.279
the Skype how is that trap what's it

1559.86 --> 1562.279
gonna do

1572.25 --> 1579.21
look if P Mars even tries to present

1575.01 --> 1582.27
something through Skype I actually have

1579.21 --> 1584.909
to click on agree for that to be able to

1582.27 --> 1588.5
happen so I don't think there's anything

1584.909 --> 1588.5
he can do really over Skype

1603.45 --> 1609.75
all right Jessa Conda yeah that's funny

1606.12 --> 1614.36
isn't it how that works yeah when you go

1609.75 --> 1614.36
down there you do see the opposite side

1614.39 --> 1617.66
that's right

1621.389 --> 1633.639
still flat though no no ute I don't use

1631.119 --> 1636.399
Internet Explorer and use it for

1633.639 --> 1640.779
absolutely nothing I only used it for

1636.399 --> 1642.399
Google Hangouts because it was on my

1640.779 --> 1644.23
computer anyway in that way I didn't

1642.399 --> 1648.7589999999998
have to install some other type of

1644.23 --> 1654.3990000000001
browser that I trust even less but yeah

1648.759 --> 1657.249
I'm forced to use Chrome now I'm not

1654.399 --> 1663.07
using it right now but I will be trying

1657.249 --> 1668.759
to recalibrate everything using Google

1663.07 --> 1668.759
Chrome for the Google Hangouts goody

1681.3 --> 1690.3799999999999
yeah all right oh that's funny

1686.82 --> 1692.76
you you say that Daniel but I am careful

1690.38 --> 1696.75
psychoanalyzing and I'm pretty damn sure

1692.76 --> 1702.27
that you are also driven by ego doesn't

1696.75 --> 1704.25
have to be nefarious though but I've

1702.27 --> 1707.49
always found you do yeah

1704.25 --> 1709.62
your behavior very predictable and ego

1707.49 --> 1714.1200000000001
is definitely involved and it's funny

1709.62 --> 1717.2399999999998
that you would even bring it up and deny

1714.12 --> 1725.6999999999998
it that's very typical that a very

1717.24 --> 1728.16
typical ego behavior but don't worry

1725.7 --> 1732.45
about it and I'm gonna hold it against

1728.16 --> 1734.99
you and hey I have I have an ego as well

1732.45 --> 1742.1100000000001
I don't really try to hide it

1734.99 --> 1745.909
[Music]

1742.11 --> 1745.9089999999999
just trying to deal with it

1768.59 --> 1773.4599999999998
what the [ __ ]

1770.11 --> 1773.4599999999998
[Music]

1776.52 --> 1779.72
now come on

1803.32 --> 1816.54
yeah Daniel I do have a basis for saying

1806.38 --> 1820.5900000000001
that and as in primary motivation yeah

1816.54 --> 1824.05
look you don't have to be conscience

1820.59 --> 1828.49
that it is a primary motivation because

1824.05 --> 1835.2
it tends to hide itself but the form it

1828.49 --> 1838.0
manifests as is protecting you from

1835.2 --> 1842.73
realization that what you believe in is

1838.0 --> 1848.29
a dream and the ego is part of this

1842.73 --> 1853.03
religious system to keep your conscious

1848.29 --> 1856.36
from moving outside of the boundaries of

1853.03 --> 1859.33
that dream and it goes through the

1856.36 --> 1864.3999999999999
subconscious through your more impulsive

1859.33 --> 1867.04
side of your identity to do that and you

1864.4 --> 1874.3300000000002
absolutely show all the symptoms of it

1867.04 --> 1876.36
like many ballers so yeah here's what it

1874.33 --> 1876.36
is

1888.75 --> 1894.059
yeah

1891.18 --> 1895.16
paycheck I doubt Daniels being paid for

1894.059 --> 1898.23
this [ __ ]

1895.16 --> 1902.5800000000002
although yeah it all matters

1898.23 --> 1905.67
it depends what he's doing with it

1902.58 --> 1907.71
maybe the payments payment is in the

1905.67 --> 1914.25
lore of it which is still kind of

1907.71 --> 1921.1100000000001
popular but as for me what drives me to

1914.25 --> 1929.46
do all this yeah I could say it is also

1921.11 --> 1935.75
yeah lane in ego somewhat but it's more

1929.46 --> 1940.8600000000001
like I I don't know I like talking about

1935.75 --> 1944.22
and discussing complicated science

1940.86 --> 1945.9289999999999
subject science really cultural science

1944.22 --> 1948.179
related subjects including the

1945.929 --> 1952.5
presuppositional systems and all that I

1948.179 --> 1955.2
like dealing with that because yeah I

1952.5 --> 1957.84
find it inspiring and I always learn new

1955.2 --> 1961.25
things I have this knack to figure out

1957.84 --> 1965.4599999999998
new things in the middle of everything

1961.25 --> 1968.7
like find new gems in the middle of it

1965.46 --> 1973.28
digging for gems in the information as I

1968.7 --> 1978.15
go I have a special talent for that but

1973.28 --> 1982.85
yeah I do have pride like one of my ego

1978.15 --> 1982.8500000000001
weaknesses is still pride

1983.84 --> 1997.79
and it's complicated to deal with that

1987.1 --> 2000.6
but so yeah I'm not denying that I do

1997.79 --> 2000.6
have an ego

2008.91 --> 2017.46
but I try not to let my ego get in the

2012.15 --> 2021.42
way of learning things of letting things

2017.46 --> 2023.67
sink in of moving on and that is what

2021.42 --> 2027.03
the ego tends to do for a lot of people

2023.67 --> 2030.75
a lot of the time to keep people stuck

2027.03 --> 2033.3
in place it's kind of bound their their

2030.75 --> 2038.64
egos are bound to keep them stuck in

2033.3 --> 2039.78
their place in their mental place and I

2038.64 --> 2043.7700000000002
don't do that

2039.78 --> 2047.94
definitely although I do let my train of

2043.77 --> 2051.96
thought get destroyed by distractions

2047.94 --> 2057.179
that my ego allows in basically so yeah

2051.96 --> 2060.179
that happens it's more in my own

2057.179 --> 2064.7400000000002
disadvantage in general but I don't let

2060.179 --> 2067.58
my ego obstruct my intellectual

2064.74 --> 2067.58
progression

2070.52 --> 2076.07
I was trying to avoid that it's only

2073.19 --> 2080.33
when I feel really shitty that my ego

2076.07 --> 2084.77
gets in the way by persecuting me for no

2080.33 --> 2088.52
good reason so yeah then it obstructed

2084.77 --> 2090.32
obstructs my intellect just constantly I

2088.52 --> 2092.119
don't even need interactions with other

2090.32 --> 2096.07
peoples for that to be happening and

2092.119 --> 2102.3500000000004
that's really agitating when it happens

2096.07 --> 2109.04
yeah so yeah ego goodie it's a part of

2102.35 --> 2113.15
all of us and most people have to deal

2109.04 --> 2118.7599999999998
with lifetimes in order to just be able

2113.15 --> 2126.7000000000003
to manage it deal with it and prevent it

2118.76 --> 2126.7000000000003
from disrupting things in any way

2129.65 --> 2138.48
yeah hello peanuts Clark I'm doing okay

2134.51 --> 2140.3300000000004
that's a lot of new people chat here see

2138.48 --> 2146.12
Rosen tinted monocle

2140.33 --> 2150.84
Juan Carlos a GM of course is McLeod ute

2146.12 --> 2154.62
then you of course [ __ ] to use and

2150.84 --> 2160.26
mercury seven i unblocked a couple of

2154.62 --> 2163.08
people by the way overall not yeah

2160.26 --> 2166.53
there's still vast amounts of just

2163.08 --> 2168.33
disgusting trolls everywhere but yeah

2166.53 --> 2172.23
those are moans mostly just soccer

2168.33 --> 2179.39
controls but regular people I unlocked a

2172.23 --> 2179.39
lot of them dress is mostly the same

2180.17 --> 2184.52
Karen B of course you

2200.0 --> 2208.69
no nothing happening that doesn't make

2202.76 --> 2208.69
you a troll trolling makes you a troll

2222.75 --> 2232.65
all right well Daniel I think that's a

2227.64 --> 2235.3199999999997
matter of perspective I think that you

2232.65 --> 2240.42
overplay how calm and direct you really

2235.32 --> 2245.63
are yeah you do seem to be technically

2240.42 --> 2249.96
very careful with what you say but yeah

2245.63 --> 2251.88
you definitely do get steered by your

2249.96 --> 2254.13
ego the direction you take in your

2251.88 --> 2255.92
arguments what you overemphasize you

2254.13 --> 2261.59
seem to have a lot of trouble

2255.92 --> 2265.109
sizing up how appropriate it even is to

2261.59 --> 2268.98
to put any detail in the scope in an

2265.109 --> 2272.24
argument it's like I don't know if you

2268.98 --> 2275.849
people may consider it kind of an artist

2272.24 --> 2279.06
typical thing to do I used to have that

2275.849 --> 2280.71
as well just not being able to scale the

2279.06 --> 2285.9
information properly during a

2280.71 --> 2288.63
conversation but yeah that's also the

2285.9 --> 2292.589
ego then that makes that decision for

2288.63 --> 2296.9700000000003
you so yeah definitely definitely

2292.589 --> 2299.88
you do have ego that is driving you do

2296.97 --> 2307.74
during those conversations and you

2299.88 --> 2311.33
overestimate yourself a lot I'm talking

2307.74 --> 2311.33
to Daniel by the way for anyone

2315.32 --> 2323.3300000000004
I didn't delete Oaks comments I just

2321.11 --> 2326.8700000000003
took away his ranch for trolling and

2323.33 --> 2331.0299999999997
then timed it out because he was making

2326.87 --> 2331.0299999999997
jokes that I didn't think we're funny

2331.51 --> 2334.78
that's all

2354.14 --> 2367.29
yeah I agree hon Carlos there people are

2362.25 --> 2370.76
so loud and noisy these days children

2367.29 --> 2377.6
just yell for no damn reason really hard

2370.76 --> 2381.1200000000003
like I I don't like all that noise eNOS

2377.6 --> 2384.06
but it's become normal normalized and

2381.12 --> 2391.16
people just shoot off into that kind of

2384.06 --> 2395.2799999999997
mode and I hate it because if I can

2391.16 --> 2398.91
dragged into that type of loudness then

2395.28 --> 2401.01
I go berserk very quickly then I become

2398.91 --> 2404.16
like I'm sick of this I will make my

2401.01 --> 2407.2200000000003
freakin point and I will yell so aloud

2404.16 --> 2409.83
as to make you deaf in order to make you

2407.22 --> 2412.9199999999996
shut up so I can just say my say and be

2409.83 --> 2414.95
done with it that's how I respond to

2412.92 --> 2421.82
that

2414.95 --> 2421.8199999999997
[Music]

2422.1 --> 2432.86
so I don't like ya loud loud and noisy

2427.26 --> 2443.3300000000004
and act accusatory let me say that

2432.86 --> 2448.86
accusation Oh huh well Daniel bring back

2443.33 --> 2452.46
manners the flattered debates that's

2448.86 --> 2456.0
gonna be kind of tough with ya the

2452.46 --> 2458.09
hardcore baller zealots and the trained

2456.0 --> 2460.5
flat-earthers

2458.09 --> 2462.6600000000003
panelists from the Flat Earth debates to

2460.5 --> 2466.04
keep that completely civilized that's

2462.66 --> 2466.04
gonna be very very tough

2471.08 --> 2479.0499999999997
what are you talking about in Loch York

2475.82 --> 2482.6000000000004
I have nobody blocked Jose is not

2479.05 --> 2482.9900000000002
blocked I even checked he wasn't even

2482.6 --> 2487.16
locked

2482.99 --> 2491.75
I've never blocked him not blocked him

2487.16 --> 2494.1499999999996
in my chat even never hid him he is not

2491.75 --> 2496.72
blocked I timed him out once when he was

2494.15 --> 2496.7200000000003
being an ass

2498.04 --> 2506.5299999999997
you're not blocked yeah

2512.9 --> 2515.9390000000003
[Music]

2548.91 --> 2554.19
well that's that's a very funny

2551.539 --> 2558.809
incorrectly asked question nothing

2554.19 --> 2563.16
happening yeah I think Nathan's

2558.809 --> 2566.67
character on YouTube is an act but I

2563.16 --> 2570.8999999999996
don't think that he is a character he is

2566.67 --> 2573.71
himself so they are assuming that Nathan

2570.9 --> 2578.1600000000003
is a character is just wrong

2573.71 --> 2584.5190000000002
he's doing exactly what he does and he

2578.16 --> 2589.529
does apply a certain speech art he has

2584.519 --> 2592.2589999999996
speaking skills explaining skills very

2589.529 --> 2594.75
very well-developed once he has a talent

2592.259 --> 2596.18
for it and he's applying them and that's

2594.75 --> 2599.97
not an act

2596.18 --> 2604.2889999999998
that's called socializing that's called

2599.97 --> 2608.819
being able to actually perfect ringing

2604.289 --> 2612.9900000000002
across a certain message that's not an

2608.819 --> 2616.47
act because he's full into it he's

2612.99 --> 2619.589
putting his reputation on the line every

2616.47 --> 2623.16
time because he believes in it and he's

2619.589 --> 2626.16
thought it out very carefully most of

2623.16 --> 2627.21
the time but yeah if he finds out that

2626.16 --> 2632.16
something was off

2627.21 --> 2634.7
then he'll correct it very quickly he's

2632.16 --> 2634.7
not an act

2638.16 --> 2646.259
now if you just happen to not like it

2642.289 --> 2649.23
not like the feel of what he does that's

2646.259 --> 2651.72
your problem that's your personal

2649.23 --> 2654.7400000000002
dislike of it I really like it I think

2651.72 --> 2659.25
it's really cool what he does

2654.74 --> 2662.6299999999997
I'm very impressed and I laugh a lot

2659.25 --> 2662.63
during the debates

2686.98 --> 2690.179
[Music]

2690.22 --> 2710.5989999999997
it seems to be a problem for you because

2692.98 --> 2717.44
you are assuming it's an that no fish

2710.599 --> 2722.3900000000003
guy you are not all youth youtubers real

2717.44 --> 2728.059
people nor real thoughts only people

2722.39 --> 2736.279
that actually go on panels and show

2728.059 --> 2738.65
their face are reliable enough to be

2736.279 --> 2742.46
yeah to be able to size them up as real

2738.65 --> 2744.44
people that are not doing acts because a

2742.46 --> 2750.279
lot of people on the internet and in

2744.44 --> 2755.66
chats are pure acts they're just using

2750.279 --> 2758.269
the anonymity platform to put put a

2755.66 --> 2761.93
certain type of stereotype character

2758.269 --> 2764.019
down to vent off a lot of frustration or

2761.93 --> 2767.239
to let the ego thrive

2764.019 --> 2770.569
that is an act that's a complete

2767.239 --> 2773.029
fabrication and if you'd see the person

2770.569 --> 2775.67
that was doing it you would just be

2773.029 --> 2781.549
freaked out because it's like it doesn't

2775.67 --> 2785.329
match at all that's an act people that

2781.549 --> 2789.319
go on YouTube make videos with their own

2785.329 --> 2792.71
face in it talking about things that's

2789.319 --> 2796.339
rarely an act and if it is it'll be very

2792.71 --> 2799.009
telling because yeah people that act

2796.339 --> 2801.589
that follow a program by their own

2799.009 --> 2804.079
design usually they can't improvise

2801.589 --> 2806.089
they can never improvise that they have

2804.079 --> 2809.0190000000002
a lot of trouble doing it so they won't

2806.089 --> 2812.989
like live panels and that kind of setup

2809.019 --> 2813.9799999999996
or they'll end up having huge response

2812.989 --> 2816.95
trickery box

2813.98 --> 2820.609
is to just give default responses as

2816.95 --> 2824.21
part of their act but yeah as soon as

2820.609 --> 2826.58
you then really force them to improvise

2824.21 --> 2830.42
anyway and to really think about what

2826.58 --> 2833.72
they do that's when they break apart and

2830.42 --> 2836.09
that's well a lot of people on the

2833.72 --> 2840.7599999999998
bowler side they function like this it's

2836.09 --> 2843.8900000000003
all an act but usually they lose track

2840.76 --> 2848.32
that it is an act and they think it is

2843.89 --> 2853.58
real and they make it real to them and

2848.32 --> 2857.81
they act like that outside of YouTube as

2853.58 --> 2862.33
well I'll bet you they'll act like that

2857.81 --> 2862.33
towards their social circles

2864.58 --> 2868.72
it's not natural behavior

2873.499 --> 2879.749
right flatlander lots of people on

2876.269 --> 2884.2189999999996
YouTube are acting but those are script

2879.749 --> 2887.93
followers that's acting well you're not

2884.219 --> 2887.93
just being your natural self

2901.57 --> 2905.8
right and there's lots of people just

2903.82 --> 2909.7000000000003
trying to get money just trying to get

2905.8 --> 2914.2000000000003
that niche of weirdo YouTube Watchers

2909.7 --> 2916.3599999999997
that just love Mass watching a certain

2914.2 --> 2920.5
type of thing like people playing video

2916.36 --> 2924.82
games for whatever crazy reason seems to

2920.5 --> 2928.99
be absurdly popular and getting some

2924.82 --> 2931.9900000000002
people a lot of money because there's

2928.99 --> 2935.2299999999996
apparently just entire swathes of people

2931.99 --> 2941.14
out there that obsessively love to watch

2935.23 --> 2944.64
that [ __ ] for some weird aberrant

2941.14 --> 2944.64
cultural reason

2950.97 --> 2956.68
no flatlander I didn't see Jarrod's

2953.59 --> 2959.44
video yesterday it's been a lot of

2956.68 --> 2964.18
different videos so that I can't keep

2959.44 --> 2966.91
track of them all man I just can also

2964.18 --> 2969.91
it's I don't just watch Flat Earth

2966.91 --> 2973.48
related channels you know like that's a

2969.91 --> 2976.3599999999997
full-time job but I also follow all

2973.48 --> 2980.26
their news Alex Jones related news look

2976.36 --> 2984.01
at the RT a lot even have to look at the

2980.26 --> 2985.84
Dutch news sometimes so I follow a lot

2984.01 --> 2989.1600000000003
of different things and I just can't

2985.84 --> 2992.02
follow all the youtubers I can't do it

2989.16 --> 2997.95
I'm only one man I need to be three

2992.02 --> 2997.95
people in order to keep track of it all

3002.27 --> 3012.9
but yeah I do like I do like jaren's

3005.73 --> 3017.43
work overall alright flatland I'll check

3012.9 --> 3019.83
it out yep Geoffrey Bill and then

3017.43 --> 3025.3199999999997
there's the yellow fest situation my god

3019.83 --> 3027.33
I just try to keep up a little at what's

3025.32 --> 3029.6090000000004
going on but yeah people could

3027.33 --> 3032.2799999999997
technically make a full time job out of

3029.609 --> 3037.64
that just be a yellow fest journalist

3032.28 --> 3037.6400000000003
and they'll be busy all day unite

3041.01 --> 3044.349
[Music]

3048.69 --> 3056.039
mm-hmm right Steve yeah Steve says I

3052.799 --> 3058.849
like watching video game play but yeah

3056.039 --> 3062.3390000000004
well you're not the only one

3058.849 --> 3064.4700000000003
there's tons of people millions and

3062.339 --> 3067.95
millions of people that apparently like

3064.47 --> 3069.5099999999998
that especially in the young age

3067.95 --> 3075.5099999999998
category but they're all over the place

3069.51 --> 3077.4
I think I think also yeah where is it

3075.51 --> 3079.94
coming from I think that a lot of people

3077.4 --> 3084.569
have been playing video games

3079.94 --> 3088.65
fanatically and then after a while got

3084.569 --> 3090.089
sick of it but still want to feel a

3088.65 --> 3093.0
little bit of the glory

3090.089 --> 3096.66
so after basically having run out of

3093.0 --> 3098.579
energy to play themselves they just like

3096.66 --> 3101.0099999999998
to watch other people play the game and

3098.579 --> 3104.4500000000003
ride along with the experience so maybe

3101.01 --> 3112.9500000000003
it is kind of almost like an ex gamer

3104.45 --> 3117.5989999999997
kind of response and to be fair ten

3112.95 --> 3122.22
years ago I too liked to watch people

3117.599 --> 3124.4700000000003
play games that was very funny I lost I

3122.22 --> 3129.0
lost my appetite for it quite quickly

3124.47 --> 3132.45
after like two years but in 2008 there

3129.0 --> 3136.289
was already some of yeah a couple of

3132.45 --> 3138.5989999999997
channels that did did this play games

3136.289 --> 3140.67
and review it and then I would be

3138.599 --> 3142.92
watching it or even have a friend over

3140.67 --> 3146.4
and then we have a couple of beers and

3142.92 --> 3150.059
just watch watch that [ __ ] and watch

3146.4 --> 3152.2200000000003
some funny videos and stuff and yeah

3150.059 --> 3156.029
back then I already predicted like oh

3152.22 --> 3159.72
[ __ ] this is hilarious this could become

3156.029 --> 3163.26
something and it did it did big-time

3159.72 --> 3165.4199999999996
it's the huge amount of gamer channels

3163.26 --> 3167.5490000000004
now that that make a lot of money

3165.42 --> 3170.549
because it's what I have been popular as

3167.549 --> 3175.67
hell huge amount of people watching that

3170.549 --> 3180.02
[ __ ] hilarious and bid worrying though

3175.67 --> 3180.02
but yeah that happens

3182.6 --> 3197.97
hmm yeah you kind of agree PC games did

3189.57 --> 3200.57
kind of break down but I'd say almost

3197.97 --> 3200.5699999999997
everything

3201.18 --> 3212.73
after 2010 or something I kind of lost

3206.19 --> 3213.3
interest in almost all game types it's

3212.73 --> 3216.75
weird

3213.3 --> 3221.67
I do still pay some or play some on the

3216.75 --> 3224.79
side but I get very impatient with them

3221.67 --> 3227.09
often it's it's just not the same

3224.79 --> 3227.09
anymore

3229.31 --> 3236.66
yeah a video game nerd you actually know

3232.71 --> 3242.58
that that's hilarious

3236.66 --> 3244.3799999999997
yeah I I've been a fan you Steve you

3242.58 --> 3248.36
might even know this [ __ ] I've been a

3244.38 --> 3251.85
fan of the nostalgia critic like a movie

3248.36 --> 3255.78
reviewer nostalgic old movie reviewer

3251.85 --> 3258.33
he's been added for 15 years and he even

3255.78 --> 3262.4700000000003
was in movies they made together with

3258.33 --> 3265.0099999999998
the video game nerd does that say

3262.47 --> 3269.64
anything to you or did I just no doubt

3265.01 --> 3270.84
about really stupid stuff you know him

3269.64 --> 3273.0
okay cool

3270.84 --> 3277.6800000000003
yeah I've been following that [ __ ]

3273.0 --> 3281.61
forever I was a particular fan on the on

3277.68 --> 3284.7
the nostalgia critic side and a whole

3281.61 --> 3288.9300000000003
group of people yeah that he was working

3284.7 --> 3291.83
with and one guy fayliss I particularly

3288.93 --> 3296.46
liked him is one of the most sarcastic

3291.83 --> 3300.12
ridiculous cartoon reviewers ever and I

3296.46 --> 3303.63
just love that [ __ ] it is so so out

3300.12 --> 3306.45
there so geeky I don't know be watching

3303.63 --> 3308.51
him for 15 years it just stays freakin

3306.45 --> 3308.5099999999998
hilarious

3308.97 --> 3319.06
it's weird anyway it's all in there it's

3312.73 --> 3322.2
tough but yeah movie reviewing and game

3319.06 --> 3326.2799999999997
reviewing was a big thing back then a

3322.2 --> 3326.2799999999997
lot of people trying it out

3330.48 --> 3334.05
[Music]

3353.84 --> 3361.69
okay it was that somebody's prank

3357.87 --> 3365.5899999999997
calling me stop it

3361.69 --> 3365.59
[Music]

3366.05 --> 3370.3
yeah

3368.21 --> 3373.48
[Music]

3370.3 --> 3373.48
all right

3378.73 --> 3385.38
hmm the Dreamcast my god it's a long

3382.93 --> 3385.3799999999997
time ago

3412.16 --> 3424.45
[Music]

3420.37 --> 3429.49
I don't know Jeffrey bill I think we do

3424.45 --> 3435.2799999999997
have say in what we put in our bodies up

3429.49 --> 3437.7099999999996
to a certain extent but yeah if you're

3435.28 --> 3439.9300000000003
gonna assume that you don't or that it's

3437.71 --> 3443.08
too difficult yeah then you're screwed

3439.93 --> 3448.66
and you're gonna die probably pretty

3443.08 --> 3455.49
painfully so that's why I chose not to

3448.66 --> 3455.49
do that and put it all in into it

3462.329 --> 3476.9100000000003
all right vaccinations [ __ ] and

3466.619 --> 3479.71
cheap-ass snack food it's just terrible

3476.91 --> 3483.7599999999998
drinks with all kinds of chemical [ __ ]

3479.71 --> 3487.66
in them and just the regular food that

3483.76 --> 3494.2200000000003
is considered to be normal okay that

3487.66 --> 3500.47
stuff is toxic waste it's all junk I

3494.22 --> 3504.22
stay the hell away from it and yeah

3500.47 --> 3505.8689999999997
things like like alcohol even in the

3504.22 --> 3508.75
organic version it's not gonna be

3505.869 --> 3510.549
healthy for you for obvious reasons but

3508.75 --> 3514.47
if you compare that to regular

3510.549 --> 3518.95
non-organic type alcohol drinks my god

3514.47 --> 3521.319
it's a big difference and yeah when

3518.95 --> 3525.45
you're kind of young you might not

3521.319 --> 3529.96
notice that difference but it builds up

3525.45 --> 3532.66
everything you do builds up to later and

3529.96 --> 3535.63
you're gonna all have to recover all of

3532.66 --> 3539.17
the damage you do at some point and if

3535.63 --> 3544.2400000000002
you don't it's gonna build up until you

3539.17 --> 3548.319
completely damaged from it and I had to

3544.24 --> 3552.91
pay physically for the times that I

3548.319 --> 3555.91
didn't eat healthy that had a very bad

3552.91 --> 3558.549
side effect on me and I stopped doing

3555.91 --> 3560.3999999999996
that and eating really healthy and even

3558.549 --> 3563.44
better and even better

3560.4 --> 3572.26
step-by-step getting even stricter and

3563.44 --> 3575.339
now a vegetarian I don't I don't become

3572.26 --> 3575.3390000000004
sick anymore

3575.67 --> 3584.609
like the real type of cold that people

3581.109 --> 3587.469
refer to or just that doesn't happen

3584.609 --> 3589.569
yeah the only shitty thing that I

3587.469 --> 3593.069
sometimes have is just bad moods or

3589.569 --> 3597.279
being feeling shitty or sad or

3593.069 --> 3599.65
incompetence that kind of thing but

3597.279 --> 3604.719
other than that my health is just really

3599.65 --> 3606.94
great yeah when's the last time I've had

3604.719 --> 3610.299
serious facial problem face problems

3606.94 --> 3613.18
remember well that's that was mostly

3610.299 --> 3615.489
just psychosomatic even so I was even

3613.18 --> 3619.589
eating healthy then but yeah when you're

3615.489 --> 3622.239
in great psychological distress

3619.589 --> 3626.7
yeah that's at least with me it has a

3622.239 --> 3626.7
lot of backlash um that kind of thing

3627.299 --> 3632.2889999999998
just pure psychological stress can be

3630.549 --> 3635.64
damaging as well but that's more

3632.289 --> 3638.1400000000003
damaging on the short run and it's

3635.64 --> 3640.92
comparatively easy to recover from

3638.14 --> 3644.91
because if that stress goes away you

3640.92 --> 3648.309
instantly recover well compare that to

3644.91 --> 3652.959
getting toxic [ __ ] in from really

3648.309 --> 3656.469
unhealthy food that you don't really

3652.959 --> 3660.279
recover so quickly from it because

3656.469 --> 3663.369
there's like toxins being leached into

3660.279 --> 3666.539
your body that have their influence and

3663.369 --> 3670.6600000000003
don't just go away again so easily and

3666.539 --> 3673.4990000000003
that sticks and it builds up with more

3670.66 --> 3673.499
of that kind of stuff

3674.97 --> 3678.859
okay I see now

3684.69 --> 3694.53
yeah junk does buildup it does so kinds

3691.71 --> 3698.43
chemicals that build up just from

3694.53 --> 3703.77
regular food it influences your hormonal

3698.43 --> 3709.71
system that influences your mood goes

3703.77 --> 3712.89
all over the place and eventually yeah

3709.71 --> 3714.9
you'll pay the price because when your

3712.89 --> 3719.069
metabolism and your hormonal system are

3714.9 --> 3721.71
just prolonged out of whack that's when

3719.069 --> 3723.839
real damage can arrive when suddenly

3721.71 --> 3729.48
your recovery system may just falter

3723.839 --> 3734.52
then things will stop regenerating and

3729.48 --> 3737.069
there will be toxic overload because

3734.52 --> 3740.609
every time your body is out of whack and

3737.069 --> 3742.41
is dealing with even minor poisons then

3740.609 --> 3744.5099999999998
suddenly it might just not be able to

3742.41 --> 3746.069
deal with them that's the most weird

3744.51 --> 3748.849
thing that's the most incredible thing

3746.069 --> 3753.029
about it if you eat incredibly healthy

3748.849 --> 3756.119
prolonged persistently then yeah you may

3753.029 --> 3758.94
suddenly get poison or anything and the

3756.119 --> 3762.44
response will be pretty vivid but you

3758.94 --> 3766.309
also recover from it very quickly

3762.44 --> 3768.869
because everything is so well founded

3766.309 --> 3772.01
everything is filled and working

3768.869 --> 3775.4300000000003
properly and all the mechanisms all work

3772.01 --> 3779.01
well if you're constantly and you have

3775.43 --> 3781.89
toxic backdrop and hormonal deregulation

3779.01 --> 3786.8390000000004
going on then those recovery systems

3781.89 --> 3790.71
don't work and the weird thing is yeah

3786.839 --> 3793.319
you may have less backlash on the first

3790.71 --> 3797.43
hand from getting in crap because you're

3793.319 --> 3799.98
kind of used to getting in crap but yeah

3797.43 --> 3803.279
your body is gonna have much worse

3799.98 --> 3806.67
long-term response to it because it can

3803.279 --> 3810.75
properly regenerate itself and that

3806.67 --> 3813.23
that's how your body works in general

3810.75 --> 3816.57
it's kind of an overgeneralization but

3813.23 --> 3818.78
it really works well if you keep this in

3816.57 --> 3818.78
mind

3822.859 --> 3829.65
yeah well glyphosate glyphosate is one

3827.099 --> 3832.77
of the primary examples of these types

3829.65 --> 3837.7200000000003
of poisons it's one of the worst and it

3832.77 --> 3841.98
builds up it you you can eat it whatever

3837.72 --> 3844.4399999999996
in any way well I didn't recommend it

3841.98 --> 3849.109
not even a molecule stay away from that

3844.44 --> 3851.88
crap but if you do it's not just gonna

3849.109 --> 3853.609
go through the metabolic system and go

3851.88 --> 3857.369
away again no it's actually going to be

3853.609 --> 3858.7799999999997
absorbed in your fats and gonna settle

3857.369 --> 3860.19
in your body and it's going to be hard

3858.78 --> 3863.94
to get rid of and it's gonna have its

3860.19 --> 3865.859
influence and that builds up it keeps on

3863.94 --> 3868.76
building it's terrible it's a terrible

3865.859 --> 3868.7599999999998
poison

3874.22 --> 3878.81
so thank God this is purely organic

3884.03 --> 3897.82
no pesticide in this right

3902.76 --> 3915.71
a GM this is not a good place to be

3910.2 --> 3919.74
growing plants because it gets way too

3915.71 --> 3922.2200000000003
windy and at times it's just all being

3919.74 --> 3922.22
blown away

3928.89 --> 3937.2999999999997
but in the kitchen downstairs here I do

3932.59 --> 3943.9
have a couple of like herb plants basil

3937.3 --> 3946.51
oregano that I yeah try to raise I keep

3943.9 --> 3950.1600000000003
them alive it's kind of a hobby and I

3946.51 --> 3952.96
use it for my cooking as well so yeah

3950.16 --> 3956.92
behind the window out I'll out of the

3952.96 --> 3961.57
wind yeah sure I am keeping a couple of

3956.92 --> 3963.88
plants but like really real plants or

3961.57 --> 3966.52
even like cannabis or anything yeah it

3963.88 --> 3968.77
just doesn't work because it's it's

3966.52 --> 3972.45
it'll all get blown away all the time

3968.77 --> 3972.45
like including the dirt

3977.28 --> 3980.0600000000004
hmm

3980.72 --> 3985.22
yeah and with cannabis it's not very

3983.18 --> 3994.609
useful because I don't have any place to

3985.22 --> 3997.25
dry it and as I could find somebody out

3994.609 --> 3999.68
there with a house that would be willing

3997.25 --> 4007.02
to keep it in their shadow or anything

3999.68 --> 4012.79
to dry it that's not gonna be we're here

4007.02 --> 4015.43
yeah Jeffrey Bale Island is not all too

4012.79 --> 4020.14
windy but I happen to be on the top

4015.43 --> 4021.93
floor of a flat apartment building right

4020.14 --> 4025.54
in the corner

4021.93 --> 4029.109
we're like the maximum wind passes

4025.54 --> 4031.329
through there like there's its point a

4029.109 --> 4035.68
turbulence point where just the wind is

4031.329 --> 4041.38
the strongest so yeah I get extra extra

4035.68 --> 4043.74
hard wind because of the position on the

4041.38 --> 4043.7400000000002
building

4053.709 --> 4059.14
are we in generator yeah that would be

4056.569 --> 4059.14
funny

4063.47 --> 4068.3489999999997
but yeah this building has electricity

4065.78 --> 4068.349
so

4079.69 --> 4085.46
now if I want to get into that kind of

4082.7 --> 4091.24
experimentation with electrical devices

4085.46 --> 4094.42
and I'd have to really have my own house

4091.24 --> 4097.73
or at least have my own apartment

4094.42 --> 4102.53
building something where I don't have to

4097.73 --> 4105.94
share and then I can see if I can figure

4102.53 --> 4105.94
out so I'm doing something like that

4125.44 --> 4129.138999999999
anyway I think I'm gonna be around oh

4127.719 --> 4134.509
