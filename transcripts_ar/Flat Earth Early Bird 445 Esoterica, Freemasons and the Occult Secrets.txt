100.369 --> 112.13

104.42 --> 114.64
though but yeah some major wind gusts in

112.13 --> 114.64
there

122.159 --> 129.989
right but although not as constant as

124.979 --> 131.64
yesterday no but still yeah I really

129.989 --> 135.66
don't like this type of weather that

131.64 --> 140.25
much that like constant winds and just

135.66 --> 148.4
makes me Restless hmm so I got green tea

140.25 --> 154.769
with me today that's it usual yeah

148.4 --> 157.58
Monday morning let's see it was in chat

154.769 --> 165.36
first before it becomes too big

157.58 --> 169.31
okay so Christian Kumar was first silver

165.36 --> 169.31
umbrella chocolate Swan

169.4 --> 179.75
hm

170.73 --> 187.819
Stacy be / moko seeking star water

179.75 --> 187.819
Martin Ellen clearly more colored

191.28 --> 207.599
Jhansi oddity in adams Crockett yeah

204.76 --> 207.599
good to see you all

218.269 --> 226.95000000000002
right so yeah this morning not a good

225.239 --> 230.79
sleep please

226.95 --> 237.29899999999998
but yeah yesterday evening was kind of

230.79 --> 243.35999999999999
weird did anybody pick up any like globe

237.299 --> 245.87900000000002
busters I didn't see anything halfway

243.36 --> 248.609
midnight Amsterdam time I was trying to

245.879 --> 250.17
like click around on the different globe

248.609 --> 255.359
buses channels there was nothing really

250.17 --> 260.519
except for the 24 hour stream mark

255.359 --> 264.0
colored yellow Klein is a gem it's been

260.519 --> 266.1
him all along so I thought screw this

264.0 --> 267.389
I'm just gonna unblock him because it's

266.1 --> 270.41900000000004
just gonna confuse everyone

267.389 --> 273.12
and yeah he's still on probation he

270.419 --> 275.43
always was but he's been he had a

273.12 --> 282.419
character kind of behaving so that's

275.43 --> 284.58
fine right so yeah I was quite satisfied

282.419 --> 290.539
by my hangout yesterday my only regret

284.58 --> 295.349
is that it was only an hour long but

290.539 --> 299.25
that was pretty good also I I I picked

295.349 --> 301.889
up on something odd in chat that I kind

299.25 --> 306.02
of overlooked before Martin Ellen did

301.889 --> 309.389
you claim you're a 33rd degree Mason

306.02 --> 312.68
because I literally saw you say that I

309.389 --> 312.68
think it was a sock

331.62 --> 341.06
right I'd like to hear something more

335.01 --> 344.37
about that because most don't even

341.06 --> 348.33
wander around that much and wouldn't

344.37 --> 351.5
typically admit it I'd like to hear some

348.33 --> 351.5
more about it

357.35 --> 362.02000000000004
what you're saying that you were joking

359.24 --> 362.02
Martin Ellen

391.01 --> 397.61
hmm

393.53 --> 400.30999999999995
okay more colored well I understand the

397.61 --> 402.8
terminology plastic when people call it

400.31 --> 407.9
that like in the gothic scene even that

402.8 --> 410.54
was kind of a thing and it basically

407.9 --> 415.35999999999996
means people that are pretty much all

410.54 --> 418.07
it's like a plastic model you know

415.36 --> 422.69
they're relatively easy to make but

418.07 --> 426.74
they're hollow inside and yeah it's all

422.69 --> 430.76
gonna be just focusing on the looks and

426.74 --> 434.54
on how people how you want people to

430.76 --> 439.19
interpret you all that very it's super

434.54 --> 442.91
exoteric ly focused and it definitely

439.19 --> 446.6
falls into the direction of is it again

442.91 --> 449.93
of narcissism or well rather narcissists

446.6 --> 452.90000000000003
are typically very plasticky very

449.93 --> 454.7
exoteric because they want the but their

452.9 --> 457.21999999999997
motivation is purely routed in the

454.7 --> 463.34
social aspect of it what they can get

457.22 --> 467.47900000000004
with it but yeah that's what I think

463.34 --> 469.84999999999997
that's my interact it up right but I've

467.479 --> 471.979
kind of heard about the terminology

469.85 --> 474.74
explained that's what I thought that

471.979 --> 477.56
when people say somebody's plastic that

474.74 --> 482.74
that's kind of referring to that the

477.56 --> 482.74
very superficial on the outside

484.68 --> 496.35
not very open with usually a lot of Acts

492.9 --> 499.62
you know yeah

496.35 --> 502.74
cleverly defensive acts as to not reveal

499.62 --> 504.06
what somebody's motivation or feelings

502.74 --> 508.08
may be that kind of thing

504.06 --> 509.639
that can typically come with that that's

508.08 --> 512.18
what happens when you inquire when you

509.639 --> 515.339
try to enquire with plastic people

512.18 --> 520.2189999999999
anyway yeah it's not really my type of

515.339 --> 520.219
terminology but I do get it

532.09 --> 543.5500000000001
it called you a plastic scouser yeah

540.54 --> 548.3199999999999
well yeah I'm you seem to be having a

543.55 --> 552.4
lot of issues getting caught up in

548.32 --> 568.12
exoteric issues a lot so yeah there's

552.4 --> 570.99
something to that well yeah some people

568.12 --> 575.65
just use plastic to cause things fake

570.99 --> 578.83
that's true that's more in reference to

575.65 --> 581.47
general industrial situations where a

578.83 --> 584.32
copy of something may look exactly alike

581.47 --> 586.45
but when you start to feel it or use it

584.32 --> 589.029
then it turns out that it's kind of

586.45 --> 590.9200000000001
plastic it just looks the same it's not

589.029 --> 595.029
as strong it's not as functional all

590.92 --> 597.28
that so that's another approach of

595.029 --> 599.95
course plastic is an industry so yeah

597.28 --> 603.39
that's for most of the terminology in

599.95 --> 603.3900000000001
concerning plastic come from

604.68 --> 609.4
no I why would you assume that I've read

608.56 --> 612.79
anything

609.4 --> 614.65
I've read the Lord of the Rings seeking

612.79 --> 618.4699999999999
star water

614.65 --> 618.47
[Music]

620.749 --> 630.899
I've heard of him I can respond to that

624.089 --> 642.5690000000001
by saying no the combined name does not

630.899 --> 644.519
ring any bell how do you deal with

642.569 --> 646.679
someone blatantly trying to ruin your

644.519 --> 650.279
reputation especially when they're a

646.679 --> 652.35
good actor well that's tough well the

650.279 --> 657.989
way you can do it is by basically

652.35 --> 661.019
breaking their act by analyzing very

657.989 --> 665.4490000000001
carefully what they're doing and then

661.019 --> 667.949
filling in the things that they left out

665.449 --> 668.9989999999999
but you got to be right you got to

667.949 --> 670.6189999999999
really figure it out if you're just

668.999 --> 673.86
gonna make up [ __ ] then it's just gonna

670.619 --> 675.839
be slander more exoteric crap no but if

673.86 --> 680.639
you get the esoterics of what they're

675.839 --> 686.6700000000001
doing right then you got them and it's

680.639 --> 688.98
unspoken like anyway so yeah I can't

686.67 --> 693.0889999999999
really give any direct advice on how to

688.98 --> 698.059
yourself do it add it because it is kind

693.089 --> 698.0590000000001
of ethereal but I can do that

699.16 --> 702.54
pretty sure I can

706.809 --> 718.3689999999999
what Martin Alan really you're gonna

709.639 --> 720.41
call a GM a bad actor dude says the guy

718.369 --> 722.769
he openly saying he's a 33rd degree

720.41 --> 722.769
Mason

727.19 --> 731.75
and haven't really responded to any of

729.74 --> 736.339
that whether it was even a joke or not

731.75 --> 739.759
you haven't given any hint so I don't

736.339 --> 741.47
know you know I know a GM I know how

739.759 --> 743.42
goofy that guy is I know how little

741.47 --> 745.279
control he has over himself I know how

743.42 --> 748.7299999999999
much he gets caught up in [ __ ]

745.279 --> 753.459
and makes himself look like an idiot but

748.73 --> 756.85
I don't know you very well Martin Ellen

753.459 --> 759.17
but what I do know is that you said

756.85 --> 762.1990000000001
without like back paddling or anything

759.17 --> 763.8499999999999
that you were 33 the great Mason and I

762.199 --> 767.0889999999999
would like to kind of know more about

763.85 --> 770.029
that it almost makes me want to say like

767.089 --> 776.019
hey dude contact me on skype and let's

770.029 --> 781.43
talk about it when how what was it like

776.019 --> 784.069
are you still in there do they do your

781.43 --> 785.899
Mason buddies know you're on YouTube

784.069 --> 789.5
have they kind of warned you about it

785.899 --> 791.509
like don't do that or you'll be this is

789.5 --> 796.0
the consequent that they're [ __ ] I want

791.509 --> 798.8290000000001
to know because yeah I am NOT amazing

796.0 --> 802.43
I've had contact with Mason's pretty

798.829 --> 804.7399999999999
early on I through the occult road you

802.43 --> 806.199
could say through my ex incredible

804.74 --> 812.089
experiences my extra-dimensional

806.199 --> 816.17
experiences it seems like I have looked

812.089 --> 817.5690000000001
among them as it were it's it's the only

816.17 --> 823.2199999999999
way I can explain it but I've never

817.569 --> 825.11
officially like been invited to become a

823.22 --> 828.1890000000001
freemason that's the way it's it's

825.11 --> 831.649
supposed to go know at one point almost

828.189 --> 836.02
but I was kind of rejected because I was

831.649 --> 840.31
too too naive

836.02 --> 843.49
to surrender to a dream that everything

840.31 --> 848.56
is yeah that society must be good kind

843.49 --> 850.63
of thing that from a primitive

848.56 --> 852.91
standpoint because I kind of still

850.63 --> 855.22
believe that but I now give that a

852.91 --> 860.279
backdrop as to why and that is creation

855.22 --> 863.23
and the frequencies of creation and that

860.279 --> 866.35
society is basically good but it is also

863.23 --> 868.39
easily polluted these people are very

866.35 --> 877.029
easily deluded and there is a lot of

868.39 --> 879.76
delusion being thrown out there and the

877.029 --> 884.37
pollution seems to be a lot more visible

879.76 --> 888.49
than the most pure heart scars of nature

884.37 --> 893.95
that are hidden within all humans that

888.49 --> 896.529
potential and people do it to themselves

893.95 --> 899.37
they let they let society convince them

896.529 --> 899.37
to do that to themselves

909.9 --> 914.79
so now join the Masons but left very

913.17 --> 918.9499999999999
quickly because he said he didn't feel

914.79 --> 918.9499999999999
the risks of God with them hmm

921.02 --> 926.029
well yeah I can imagine

929.02 --> 934.9499999999999
well I think that through it in a

936.24 --> 941.64
visionary Kumar you know that icon is

938.589 --> 941.6400000000001
forbidden right

947.61 --> 950.15
it's

971.21 --> 980.62
yeah it's freaking is him

975.52 --> 980.62
no it's bastard

981.98 --> 986.11
what's that Adam

991.33 --> 997.62
Chadd swans okay who's that

1007.91 --> 1010.4499999999999
right

1020.68 --> 1037.149
right yeah just sent me to a a channel I

1024.939 --> 1041.439
don't know anyway back to my experiences

1037.149 --> 1044.26
my experiences is that the freemasons

1041.439 --> 1046.99
I can absolutely not even pinpoint in

1044.26 --> 1052.529
what age this was because I did talk a

1046.99 --> 1057.279
lot with a lot of people like in a way I

1052.529 --> 1060.7
wasn't very social towards like general

1057.279 --> 1066.49
people are concerning sports or even

1060.7 --> 1068.6490000000001
going out you know with my own people of

1066.49 --> 1071.169
my own age category you know that but

1068.649 --> 1072.85
what I did do is kind of through my

1071.169 --> 1076.8400000000001
parents or rittany because they had a

1072.85 --> 1078.24
lot of interesting people musicians also

1076.84 --> 1080.59
just more intellectual people

1078.24 --> 1082.21
philosopher types like natural

1080.59 --> 1085.3899999999999
philosophers I know like an official

1082.21 --> 1090.429
philosopher guy he's kind of naughty but

1085.39 --> 1092.8600000000001
he's very very built it's like very

1090.429 --> 1095.98
serious about the craft that he deals

1092.86 --> 1100.4799999999998
with his that is all its life it's like

1095.98 --> 1102.7
60 years or something but yeah through

1100.48 --> 1107.669
my parents and all that I did eventually

1102.7 --> 1111.96
I think bump into Freemasons or rather

1107.669 --> 1115.779
well they they they kind of said that

1111.96 --> 1118.3600000000001
they just they kind of saw the Bible

1115.779 --> 1120.58
from another angle and they considered

1118.36 --> 1122.77
themselves as Luciferians was very

1120.58 --> 1124.62
shocking and now it was like giant shock

1122.77 --> 1127.75
wave every time you mentioned that name

1124.62 --> 1131.6789999999999
but they seemed when I inquired they

1127.75 --> 1138.0
literally said they did not see Lucifer

1131.679 --> 1140.71
as nefarious rather bearing a very hard

1138.0 --> 1146.309
responsibility because they saw him as

1140.71 --> 1146.309
the like the keeper his realm and

1147.39 --> 1156.0
it's another philosophical approach and

1150.67 --> 1159.04
while those people didn't glance about

1156.0 --> 1162.09
that that that would imply dark things

1159.04 --> 1166.0
but they did have like a more

1162.09 --> 1168.9599999999998
neutralized perspective on morality in

1166.0 --> 1172.81
the sense that they would recognize that

1168.96 --> 1175.81
doing good would give good back and that

1172.81 --> 1180.52
doing evil would give evil back and then

1175.81 --> 1183.25
they would make decisions with that so

1180.52 --> 1185.62
there were kind of neutral not really

1183.25 --> 1188.71
evil you but I don't know you know

1185.62 --> 1190.09
that's specific individual I can't even

1188.71 --> 1192.25
name them I can't even name who they are

1190.09 --> 1194.11
literally I can't I don't know I don't

1192.25 --> 1196.3
even know the faces anyway I just know I

1194.11 --> 1198.1299999999999
have had that conversation stuck really

1196.3 --> 1199.6299999999999
with me because I had it very young and

1198.13 --> 1201.25
I didn't really understand what I was

1199.63 --> 1204.19
dealing with but I was already tapping

1201.25 --> 1209.65
into these instincts and I've now

1204.19 --> 1210.4
managed to are you say like dress up

1209.65 --> 1213.0700000000002
like a horse

1210.4 --> 1214.9
put reins on them and kind of now have

1213.07 --> 1217.8999999999999
them a little bit more under control

1214.9 --> 1221.2900000000002
I still already had that available but

1217.9 --> 1223.3000000000002
it was just being very young it just

1221.29 --> 1226.44
sorry it started to happen and I would

1223.3 --> 1229.45
just certainly level up in my attitude

1226.44 --> 1232.1200000000001
from being a young kind of lost guy into

1229.45 --> 1235.03
more adult intellectual and do an

1232.12 --> 1236.8899999999999
enquire and figure out and feel very

1235.03 --> 1239.53
finely because I did for you

1236.89 --> 1242.26
instinctively like this is there's

1239.53 --> 1245.86
something going on here that I need to

1242.26 --> 1248.2
understand it's very complex really and

1245.86 --> 1251.6799999999998
not what it seems at first and it'll

1248.2 --> 1259.27
take maybe half a lifetime that's what I

1251.68 --> 1261.67
got from that yeah so that's my my

1259.27 --> 1265.87
experience that they simply thought that

1261.67 --> 1274.45
Lucifer was kind of the appointed king

1265.87 --> 1276.4599999999998
of the creator of God but in a way it

1274.45 --> 1278.92
was also kind of contestable whether

1276.46 --> 1283.78
that God the creator himself would be

1278.92 --> 1287.44
good so yeah these people had this

1283.78 --> 1289.6
complex top-down philosophy over it all

1287.44 --> 1292.29
with different angles to the Bible and

1289.6 --> 1296.7099999999998
to the set up of creation and all that

1292.29 --> 1300.9099999999999
but apparently that system allowed them

1296.71 --> 1306.67
a lot of maneuvering room in their minds

1300.91 --> 1309.0400000000002
and hearts as to interpret what they

1306.67 --> 1312.01
would personally feel about it and what

1309.04 --> 1315.1299999999999
they would want to pursue and I guess

1312.01 --> 1319.18
it's that freedom really based on that

1315.13 --> 1322.3000000000002
on a stable kind of system approach that

1319.18 --> 1326.73
was so appealing to them was really all

1322.3 --> 1328.81
about the freedom and yeah and

1326.73 --> 1330.82
confidence of knowledge and the

1328.81 --> 1334.24
reliability of their sources and all

1330.82 --> 1338.77
that and anyway yeah it's very vague

1334.24 --> 1341.59
story you know but yeah that's my

1338.77 --> 1344.44
experiences with yeah I haven't really

1341.59 --> 1348.55
had any type of inquiries like that

1344.44 --> 1350.8300000000002
after I would now have allergic

1348.55 --> 1352.6299999999999
responses because I would understand the

1350.83 --> 1355.72
wider consequent and I would see the

1352.63 --> 1357.5500000000002
hidden darkness is a lot better I would

1355.72 --> 1360.79
poke at them I would instinctively do

1357.55 --> 1362.9199999999998
that I didn't do that back then because

1360.79 --> 1369.54
I didn't understand and I didn't have

1362.92 --> 1374.0500000000002
the light weaponized as it were yet I

1369.54 --> 1377.19
wouldn't let it dictate me as much as I

1374.05 --> 1377.19
let it do now

1379.21 --> 1385.18
because I had to see more and if you

1382.21 --> 1387.22
just shine bright then yeah if you're

1385.18 --> 1389.5
it's like this if you have a bright lamp

1387.22 --> 1391.72
you know you can see things pretty well

1389.5 --> 1396.97
but if it's too bright yeah then you

1391.72 --> 1398.32
can't see anything so yeah and then

1396.97 --> 1399.79
unless you want to start exploring

1398.32 --> 1401.98
without being able to see anything

1399.79 --> 1404.53
that's not very useful now if you

1401.98 --> 1406.15
already explored it then it wouldn't

1404.53 --> 1408.04
really matter as much as it's a blind

1406.15 --> 1410.92
because then you could basically go back

1408.04 --> 1416.2
on how you've already entered yourself

1410.92 --> 1417.91
before that from memory see yeah I do

1416.2 --> 1423.5800000000002
this kind of analogy stuff all the time

1417.91 --> 1426.7900000000002
I know what it works my life approach

1423.58 --> 1430.6799999999998
anyway yeah Mason's eye

1426.79 --> 1434.68
it's just spar example I think my

1430.68 --> 1435.1000000000001
grandfather from my mother side kind of

1434.68 --> 1436.8700000000001
was

1435.1 --> 1438.85
well he wasn't admitted Mason I don't

1436.87 --> 1441.04
know how far you even gotten degree wise

1438.85 --> 1447.6899999999998
I'm pretty certain he didn't go to the

1441.04 --> 1447.69
33rd degree but it seemed like he was

1447.86 --> 1455.05
[Music]

1450.12 --> 1460.6899999999998
also kind of like that or like me like

1455.05 --> 1465.28
very like liking the frequencies of God

1460.69 --> 1468.3600000000001
like and good like but still yeah

1465.28 --> 1470.98
because of the issues and the exoteric

1468.36 --> 1473.53
issues with the church he didn't like

1470.98 --> 1475.84
that in a direct sense I'm pretty

1473.53 --> 1478.27
certain of it and that's probably how he

1475.84 --> 1480.28
was also kind of rolling into the

1478.27 --> 1484.93
Luciferian concept a bit but more

1480.28 --> 1487.33
carefully I think I haven't like he's

1484.93 --> 1489.28
left some writings and there was it did

1487.33 --> 1491.6799999999998
absolutely did enough had not have any

1489.28 --> 1494.1299999999999
obsession with Lucifer or anything it

1491.68 --> 1496.48
was much more concerned with personal

1494.13 --> 1498.94
conflicted that's what I got from his

1496.48 --> 1499.47
focus was fascinated with personal

1498.94 --> 1502.02
conflict

1499.47 --> 1512.1100000000001
[Music]

1502.02 --> 1519.3
and his own personal conflicts anyway so

1512.11 --> 1521.83
yeah in kind of a was it bottoms up

1519.3 --> 1525.49
position I I'm pretty willing to

1521.83 --> 1528.6999999999998
basically see if I can get Freemasons

1525.49 --> 1532.29
here and and talk about things you know

1528.7 --> 1532.29
as carefully as they wanted

1548.04 --> 1562.37
so yeah it's kind of an open invitation

1550.2 --> 1565.41
I guess - well - free masons but yeah

1562.37 --> 1568.6499999999999
not necessarily seeking out like super

1565.41 --> 1572.0700000000002
connected ones but just people out there

1568.65 --> 1574.77
that are free miss and then yeah the

1572.07 --> 1577.95
several degrees not necessarily the

1574.77 --> 1580.47
literal exoteric system degrees but as

1577.95 --> 1582.0900000000001
in how deep how far they've come how

1580.47 --> 1585.39
many people have they gotten to know

1582.09 --> 1590.28
what do they think it is what do they

1585.39 --> 1594.0600000000002
think are the secrets and what about the

1590.28 --> 1596.3999999999999
consequences what about the rules you

1594.06 --> 1599.55
know I'm very curious about that like

1596.4 --> 1601.8300000000002
how serious is that how much do they

1599.55 --> 1603.99
believe there are real consequences -

1601.83 --> 1607.1799999999998
like for example breaking these rules I

1603.99 --> 1610.43
just want to know these things

1607.18 --> 1610.43
[Music]

1613.84 --> 1618.61
Craig Meister are you freemason

1629.71 --> 1634.68
yes I know it's a fraternal organization

1632.47 --> 1634.68
I know

1644.91 --> 1650.67
yes I know it is basically a little Club

1647.61 --> 1653.1299999999999
and you can go and play there but that's

1650.67 --> 1658.29
not the only thing that goes on Craig my

1653.13 --> 1661.2
sir we all know there's a Usenet new

1658.29 --> 1666.02
huge networking power networking also

1661.2 --> 1670.17
going on and there are some secrets that

1666.02 --> 1672.68
some people they're obviously have and

1670.17 --> 1672.68
are keeping

1679.55 --> 1683.77
huh okay

1684.74 --> 1690.49
all right well that seems extremely

1686.87 --> 1690.4899999999998
oversimplified but that's all right

1694.0 --> 1705.58
what secrets what do you think secrets

1700.99 --> 1709.5
of masonry secrets of secrets of

1705.58 --> 1709.5
architecture and metallurgy

1714.12 --> 1721.7399999999998
or are you guys alright you know I don't

1718.59 --> 1725.01
necessarily know if these types of

1721.74 --> 1727.29
knowledge azar available in a direct

1725.01 --> 1729.75
sense to freemason or certain types of

1727.29 --> 1732.78
lodges or whatever in the direct you

1729.75 --> 1734.61
know it could be slightly different what

1732.78 --> 1736.44
could be going on also is that the

1734.61 --> 1739.59
Vatican just has that [ __ ] I'm pretty

1736.44 --> 1743.31
sure they do they have it all pretty

1739.59 --> 1746.1899999999998
damn certain at this point not that we

1743.31 --> 1747.8999999999999
absolutely then depend on them in any

1746.19 --> 1751.47
way you know even if it was all just

1747.9 --> 1754.5300000000002
blown up we could literally reinvent all

1751.47 --> 1756.24
of it in ten years pretty damn sure it

1754.53 --> 1758.46
wouldn't need any secret freaking

1756.24 --> 1760.68
laboratories for that yeah because it is

1758.46 --> 1763.5
all stuff that people have invented that

1760.68 --> 1767.3100000000002
they kept secret that's the Vatican so

1763.5 --> 1769.65
but it could be that Vatican sometimes

1767.31 --> 1771.6599999999999
just a point certain Freemasons and says

1769.65 --> 1774.0
like okay you're gonna do this you're

1771.66 --> 1775.5
gonna do that here is the technologies

1774.0 --> 1779.43
you're gonna use and you're gonna shut

1775.5 --> 1782.67
up about it that could be the way it is

1779.43 --> 1785.88
done and that the secrets are in no at

1782.67 --> 1788.6100000000001
no point directly available to masons

1785.88 --> 1796.17
even high-ranked I don't know that's why

1788.61 --> 1801.5
I'm trying to figure this out well we're

1796.17 --> 1801.5
not talking about like what is it

1805.009 --> 1811.32
yeah we're not talking about Boy Scouts

1808.08 --> 1813.4189999999999
Club Freemasonry Craig Meister we're not

1811.32 --> 1817.559
talking about this the exoteric society

1813.419 --> 1822.71
the open invite play hang out place and

1817.559 --> 1822.71
the Hobby we're not talking about that

1836.49 --> 1842.789
no good Sheriff intent

1839.46 --> 1842.789
[Music]

1845.84 --> 1853.7189999999998
[Music]

1855.029 --> 1858.029
what

1860.06 --> 1869.69
a really flatters but didn't you catch

1862.87 --> 1873.8
didn't you catch all of that like what

1869.69 --> 1875.75
are you exactly listening to I see a lot

1873.8 --> 1880.52
of things in what Craig Meister saying

1875.75 --> 1884.57
here because he seems to be trying to

1880.52 --> 1887.06
just play yeah hang up the Billboard for

1884.57 --> 1890.12
Freemasonry say it's all right it's all

1887.06 --> 1893.84
so simple it's just easy and he's

1890.12 --> 1896.4499999999998
advertising blatantly obvious but I can

1893.84 --> 1898.01
feel that he does know there's stuff

1896.45 --> 1899.78
going on but he doesn't I don't think

1898.01 --> 1901.58
he's a typical guy that really wants to

1899.78 --> 1903.71
get into that himself

1901.58 --> 1907.22
now that's a lot of people that I bet

1903.71 --> 1909.05
just go to Freemasons just because they

1907.22 --> 1910.8500000000001
want a guy's Club they want to hang

1909.05 --> 1915.98
around with and they don't want any

1910.85 --> 1918.4699999999998
stupid girls in to distract them that

1915.98 --> 1920.9
kind of thing I bet there's a lot of

1918.47 --> 1923.59
those people there too you know just

1920.9 --> 1923.5900000000001
boys clubs

1932.899 --> 1937.6999999999998
okay Tyler Mack right

1954.97 --> 1960.72
hmm okay you're all [ __ ] that sounds

1958.45 --> 1960.72
interesting

1964.41 --> 1976.7
oh really Adam ikan oh [ __ ]

1968.929 --> 1976.7
alright that's that sounds thrilling

1981.05 --> 1987.6399999999999
all right so yeah Craig Meister thanks

1983.81 --> 1987.6399999999999
for the advertising you can stop it now

1991.84 --> 1997.899
and please take note that I am not being

1995.499 --> 2002.549
negative about Freemason I'm just trying

1997.899 --> 2004.2289999999998
to put down an honest picture what I

2002.549 --> 2008.719
think it is what I've learned from it

2004.229 --> 2011.6390000000001
and also what type of individuals are

2008.719 --> 2015.1190000000001
among them because I've experienced it

2011.639 --> 2016.9499999999998
and I will learn more as I go yeah it is

2015.119 --> 2020.509
advertisement Craig Meister everything

2016.95 --> 2023.96
you said is pretty much advertisement

2020.509 --> 2023.96
but that's all right

2045.24 --> 2056.609
really you don't know I I already

2051.149 --> 2064.19
explained it to you you were clearly

2056.609 --> 2068.04
just showing how innocent and safe and

2064.19 --> 2070.679
basic it is everything you said so far

2068.04 --> 2072.95
every single thing every single thing

2070.679 --> 2072.9500000000003
about it

2078.26 --> 2085.01
what not not telling you you are

2080.679 --> 2088.76
encouraging people to join but you are

2085.01 --> 2094.76
basically laying down how it's all so

2088.76 --> 2100.3
easy you're disclaiming any kind of yeah

2094.76 --> 2102.5600000000004
secrets secrets within the depths

2100.3 --> 2105.13
basically that within the control

2102.56 --> 2105.13
hierarchy

2107.99 --> 2113.2299999999996
[Music]

2109.72 --> 2123.8799999999997
okay okay and a Meakin I'll take a look

2113.23 --> 2126.75
at that right Craig Meister well you're

2123.88 --> 2130.75
gonna stop it now or I'm gonna ban you

2126.75 --> 2134.319
so stop putting up this act because it

2130.75 --> 2136.72
is absolutely identifiably an act that

2134.319 --> 2141.46
you're putting up and you will stop it

2136.72 --> 2145.3489999999997
right now and if that means you have

2141.46 --> 2145.349
nothing further to say then so be it

2165.3 --> 2169.46
yeah and that's how you get banned

2184.96 --> 2191.479
yeah I don't know this Craig Meister guy

2189.319 --> 2194.049
I think he's a baller and you know

2191.479 --> 2199.239
there's some ballers out there that hate

2194.049 --> 2204.65
flat-earthers so personally so much that

2199.239 --> 2207.469
they will just oppose anything a flat

2204.65 --> 2209.39
earther says no matter what they don't

2207.469 --> 2213.38
care what we're talking about they will

2209.39 --> 2217.3089999999997
oppose it because they want us dead the

2213.38 --> 2219.259
deep inside secretly and that's like a

2217.309 --> 2220.9990000000003
passive-aggressive expression so they're

2219.259 --> 2223.249
not gonna actually do that I think they

2220.999 --> 2226.999
couldn't even but that's really what's

2223.249 --> 2229.3089999999997
in there and this feels like it so Craig

2226.999 --> 2234.109
Meister is probably global and he was

2229.309 --> 2235.46
just trying to diffuse whatever I was

2234.109 --> 2242.269
doing even though it didn't have

2235.46 --> 2244.579
anything to do with the globe so well

2242.269 --> 2247.9399999999996
not everyone tiny Womble but some of

2244.579 --> 2250.15
them out there definitely do you know

2247.94 --> 2250.15
this

2260.66 --> 2266.77
huh okay Cleary that's fascinating

2276.25 --> 2282.07
Wow now that is projection pointless

2278.92 --> 2286.0
zoom but that because that is exactly

2282.07 --> 2290.05
how we feel about the ballers like where

2286.0 --> 2292.15
would flat earthers be what would the

2290.05 --> 2295.21
point be of pointing out the blatantly

2292.15 --> 2297.34
obvious nature of this world if there

2295.21 --> 2300.03
weren't some ridiculous religious

2297.34 --> 2304.7200000000003
fanatics constantly double speaking and

2300.03 --> 2309.52
bluffing and red herring like to it to

2304.72 --> 2312.58
an epic devious degree well no we

2309.52 --> 2315.16
definitely want that because it's so

2312.58 --> 2321.24
crazy what's happening it's just too

2315.16 --> 2321.24
amusing not to use it

2328.93 --> 2336.0699999999997
yeah and look every time you know every

2333.46 --> 2339.07
time I say something that is of course

2336.07 --> 2341.86
not meant as an exoteric Li right

2339.07 --> 2347.05
because when they say they want this

2341.86 --> 2349.54
dead and then I proceed to explain what

2347.05 --> 2351.6400000000003
that actually is harder Dex presses then

2349.54 --> 2354.2799999999997
it should be becoming very obvious to

2351.64 --> 2356.62
those that are actually listening trying

2354.28 --> 2359.8
to understand what I'm saying that I'm

2356.62 --> 2363.19
not talking about literally like a

2359.8 --> 2366.4900000000002
murderous act but yeah that's the the

2363.19 --> 2368.62
ballers are so dumb and superficial so

2366.49 --> 2370.9799999999996
many of them that they'll just hear that

2368.62 --> 2374.95
word and be so triggered they're gonna

2370.98 --> 2379.45
spin off like CNN news they're the micro

2374.95 --> 2381.58
CNN CNN inin news anchor in the chat

2379.45 --> 2384.1899999999996
they're going to be that guy and just

2381.58 --> 2388.5099999999998
spin forth garbage based on that trigger

2384.19 --> 2390.4
word they do that or they could have

2388.51 --> 2394.75
actually listened to what I was saying

2390.4 --> 2399.7000000000003
and understand that it was basically in

2394.75 --> 2403.87
essence it was a motivation a drive it

2399.7 --> 2407.7999999999997
is not exoteric it is not literal and I

2403.87 --> 2410.1
explained that so just wanted to clarify

2407.8 --> 2413.32
that for a second because I see people

2410.1 --> 2415.95
spiraling in chat and it's just it's

2413.32 --> 2415.9500000000003
always the same [ __ ]

2442.0 --> 2451.81
right anyway yeah yeah I will look into

2448.27 --> 2464.7
that link and make sure don't lose track

2451.81 --> 2464.7
of that about 2018 that's a while ago

2475.93 --> 2481.0
alright that bookmark this one I rarely

2478.42 --> 2487.39
bookmark things anymore these days but I

2481.0 --> 2492.9
bookmarked the video yeah so let's get

2487.39 --> 2492.9
back to to a conversation here

2542.57 --> 2549.79
man yeah there's some deep [ __ ] well

2547.4 --> 2552.7400000000002
there's some deep stuff basically

2549.79 --> 2558.65
floating up in my mind but I don't feel

2552.74 --> 2563.2999999999997
I should share that it's too it's too

2558.65 --> 2571.4900000000002
much I'll share it with somebody on my

2563.3 --> 2575.57
level in a in an offline phone call or

2571.49 --> 2578.6
whatever if I get to that it's something

2575.57 --> 2579.88
I remembered about Luciferians like why

2578.6 --> 2583.0099999999998
they do what they do

2579.88 --> 2584.51
again frew yeah a certain type of

2583.01 --> 2588.07
oversight and a philosophical approach

2584.51 --> 2595.03
and it is quite fascinating how it works

2588.07 --> 2595.03
I'll get into that later maybe

2615.46 --> 2621.309
you don't understand the entire point

2618.359 --> 2623.589
how many times do we have to explain it

2621.309 --> 2627.94
or do you just keep on forgetting it the

2623.589 --> 2630.779
explanation because I can barely imagine

2627.94 --> 2633.9700000000003
at this point that you've never heard

2630.779 --> 2637.39
the explanations as to why they will do

2633.97 --> 2641.859
this because it is blatantly obvious why

2637.39 --> 2643.74
they do this now it's not about

2641.859 --> 2649.47
stupidity

2643.74 --> 2649.47
it's about consequences

2649.92 --> 2653.91
certain knowledge is

2668.58 --> 2677.34
you don't understand well let me try to

2672.42 --> 2680.52
re-explain it like why would the entire

2677.34 --> 2682.65
scientific community community in a

2680.52 --> 2685.59
conspiracy to trick everybody the earth

2682.65 --> 2687.2400000000002
is round well for starters because all

2685.59 --> 2692.34
of those people that are in that

2687.24 --> 2696.72
scientific community have wide-range are

2692.34 --> 2698.8500000000004
widely invested into the concept that

2696.72 --> 2704.3399999999997
the earth is a globe whether it be based

2698.85 --> 2707.85
on huge money investments example well

2704.34 --> 2711.06
lately office or personal belief

2707.85 --> 2716.81
conviction because they love the globe

2711.06 --> 2720.5099999999998
and they want to be the part that

2716.81 --> 2724.4
forwards the deepening of their

2720.51 --> 2728.76
knowledge and their security about all

2724.4 --> 2732.42
the data that they yeah they gather

2728.76 --> 2738.26
based on presuppositions that that is

2732.42 --> 2744.38
what propels scientists to do that right

2738.26 --> 2744.38
money personal religious investment

2756.319 --> 2759.319
sealing

2759.51 --> 2764.4900000000002
yeah this it's all gyroscope based and

2762.21 --> 2767.369
all the gyroscopes all proof that the

2764.49 --> 2771.5699999999997
earth is freakin flat and not geometric

2767.369 --> 2774.119
is spherical because yeah unique thing

2771.57 --> 2779.04
about gyroscopes is that they stay

2774.119 --> 2782.9100000000003
oriented and if whatever they are in

2779.04 --> 2785.7599999999998
moves then the gyroscopes art within

2782.91 --> 2788.67
will stay in the exact same orientation

2785.76 --> 2791.1600000000003
no matter what I'm talking about

2788.67 --> 2793.4700000000003
physical gyroscopes so and that is how

2791.16 --> 2795.5699999999997
it's all such a reliable tool for

2793.47 --> 2798.99
orientation that's why they use them in

2795.57 --> 2803.5800000000004
in in boats big boats big rigs that's

2798.99 --> 2809.2799999999997
why they use them in airplanes and they

2803.58 --> 2813.5699999999997
don't spin around 360 degrees when you

2809.28 --> 2818.9300000000003
fly the supposed circumference of the

2813.57 --> 2818.9300000000003
earth so yeah earth is freakin flat and

2820.91 --> 2826.29
yeah that makes it very simple that's

2824.7 --> 2828.18
where the Global's come in because for

2826.29 --> 2831.21
them it's fairly complicated so then

2828.18 --> 2834.6299999999997
they have to invent a machination to

2831.21 --> 2838.41
basically account for the gravity center

2834.63 --> 2844.31
and all that blah that will cause the

2838.41 --> 2846.72
gyroscopes to stay are based oriented

2844.31 --> 2849.2999999999997
that's what they started claiming then

2846.72 --> 2852.5299999999997
and they ascribed it first to the

2849.3 --> 2856.8900000000003
pendulous fins which were blatantly not

2852.53 --> 2859.6400000000003
for that because pendulous vanes were

2856.89 --> 2862.29
basically for quick orientation

2859.64 --> 2864.93
alteration and pressure a side effects

2862.29 --> 2868.71
that gives you have just like nudge to

2864.93 --> 2871.71
the gyroscope in one shift causing a

2868.71 --> 2873.27
yeah a temporary disorientation that's

2871.71 --> 2876.7200000000003
where the pendulous feints were designed

2873.27 --> 2878.16
for to prevent it from shifting out of

2876.72 --> 2881.1899999999996
whack in certain turns

2878.16 --> 2885.27
that's the only reason pendulous vanes

2881.19 --> 2888.2400000000002
exists with gyroscopes as part of that

2885.27 --> 2891.48
technology because it didn't definitely

2888.24 --> 2897.6899999999996
was not designed to

2891.48 --> 2900.81
keep the gyroscope centered on the

2897.69 --> 2903.48
Earth's center because if the earth was

2900.81 --> 2905.4
a globe yeah it would definitely start

2903.48 --> 2907.8
shifting as you move over the earth

2905.4 --> 2909.63
because it stays in its geometrical same

2907.8 --> 2913.8900000000003
orientation because that's what physical

2909.63 --> 2917.9100000000003
gyroscopes do but it doesn't do that so

2913.89 --> 2924.5899999999997
we don't need any device to correct for

2917.91 --> 2924.5899999999997
that we never did nobody ever did

2930.72 --> 2933.3489999999997
yeah

2936.62 --> 2941.6099999999997
no that's the dumbest thing I've ever

2938.85 --> 2946.5
heard and it's a lie flypaper for

2941.61 --> 2948.1200000000003
weirdos gyroscope proving the curve

2946.5 --> 2950.94
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

2948.12 --> 2954.1189999999997
it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard

2950.94 --> 2954.119
[Music]

2960.32 --> 2963.409
[Music]

2990.85 --> 2994.0299999999997
[Music]

3003.94 --> 3010.79
the Ringling clean ring laser gyros you

3008.39 --> 3016.91
are you going there again are you see

3010.79 --> 3022.73
what the a ring laser gyro all these

3016.91 --> 3025.6299999999997
things that it doesn't any kind of

3022.73 --> 3030.43
apparent rotation any kind of drift is

3025.63 --> 3035.42
not going to be perpendicular to the

3030.43 --> 3039.3199999999997
presupposed rotation axis of the earth

3035.42 --> 3041.78
which any type of geometrical deviation

3039.32 --> 3045.23
caused by any type of gyroscope would

3041.78 --> 3051.17
have to have that drift was never that

3045.23 --> 3055.7
it was always always perfectly

3051.17 --> 3059.81
perpendicular to down right that is how

3055.7 --> 3062.3599999999997
it turns not this you know say North

3059.81 --> 3064.5099999999998
America right so if there is any kind of

3062.36 --> 3071.9500000000003
drift that means it would turn like this

3064.51 --> 3071.9500000000003
okay or this it's not happening

3072.28 --> 3077.63
it's this is the drift

3075.29 --> 3079.82
that's the drift it's perpendicular now

3077.63 --> 3083.54
unless you're on the south or north pole

3079.82 --> 3089.75
supposedly that makes no freakin sense

3083.54 --> 3092.3
on the globe so it's just clearly

3089.75 --> 3095.23
stupidity that people keep on forwarding

3092.3 --> 3095.23
this nonsense

3117.7 --> 3128.47
blahblahblog lien so yeah this is all

3125.63 --> 3128.4700000000003
garbage

3132.68 --> 3140.24
ether is a concept it exists only for

3136.97 --> 3144.5
one reason that is because people can't

3140.24 --> 3147.95
get beyond the conception of

3144.5 --> 3152.9
wave-particle duality that's it that's

3147.95 --> 3157.43
the only reason you conjured up the

3152.9 --> 3163.67
ether the only reason exists in that

3157.43 --> 3165.799
format and all the techno babble garbage

3163.67 --> 3170.079
that Empress has preceded from it in a

3165.799 --> 3170.079
mathematical extrapolation Jack efest

3174.549 --> 3182.42
the vacuum any man-made vacuum right or

3179.98 --> 3184.849
region where there is naturally less

3182.42 --> 3188.51
pressure is going to be filled with less

3184.849 --> 3195.799
air what is the problem with that

3188.51 --> 3199.4
oh really detected by lights it's been

3195.799 --> 3202.91
detected or was it extrapolated was it

3199.4 --> 3205.01
mathematically deduced gleam are you

3202.91 --> 3207.529
having some honesty problems here or are

3205.01 --> 3210.2200000000003
you are you starting to show some baller

3207.529 --> 3214.91
symptoms concerning your Lightwave

3210.22 --> 3217.25
aberration gleam I've heard you ramble

3214.91 --> 3220.339
on and on and on over at rant ease and

3217.25 --> 3223.01
it's embarrassing buddy you're a

3220.339 --> 3224.15
fantasies you're a technobabble

3223.01 --> 3228.619
fantasies

3224.15 --> 3232.01
concerning the ether and it's it's it's

3228.619 --> 3235.9900000000002
getting kind of little you're not

3232.01 --> 3235.9900000000002
careful with what you stayed at all

3237.739 --> 3244.319
seem to be having a lot of trouble

3241.939 --> 3251.1589999999997
snapping through two presuppositions

3244.319 --> 3253.409
that are really there I don't give a

3251.159 --> 3259.4590000000003
[ __ ] what brilliant scientists in the

3253.409 --> 3264.659
past have said it's a misconception

3259.459 --> 3267.4489999999996
there is no ether medium in order for a

3264.659 --> 3270.9590000000003
light to exist it's nonsense it's the

3267.449 --> 3274.919
only thing it just is being conjured up

3270.959 --> 3276.8089999999997
for that only that's the reason it

3274.919 --> 3279.209
exists in the first place it's a

3276.809 --> 3282.539
conceptual medium in order for you to

3279.209 --> 3285.8089999999997
account for light being a wave it's

3282.539 --> 3295.829
really sad and unnecessary just have to

3285.809 --> 3298.639
look a little further there is a lot of

3295.829 --> 3302.279
energy in the air but that's not a

3298.639 --> 3304.2290000000003
medium for light to transverse in that's

3302.279 --> 3307.309
just energy in the air and it's

3304.229 --> 3311.5789999999997
definitely going through material and

3307.309 --> 3313.559
hay material or very sparse material is

3311.579 --> 3317.489
the medium for a light to perpetuate

3313.559 --> 3320.3390000000004
itself in the funny thing is contrast to

3317.489 --> 3323.7490000000003
actual waves subjected to physical

3320.339 --> 3329.159
matter itself like sound for example

3323.749 --> 3331.4089999999997
light actually stays pretty much intact

3329.159 --> 3335.279
when it goes through less material in

3331.409 --> 3341.4790000000003
contrast so yeah it's not a freaking

3335.279 --> 3341.479
wave get over it

3344.23 --> 3350.31
[Music]

3346.97 --> 3353.04
now I'm talking about energy just

3350.31 --> 3354.99
electrical energy the ether and G that

3353.04 --> 3357.09
is in the air naturally as part of the

3354.99 --> 3358.1
design of this realm that's the ether

3357.09 --> 3361.59
that I talked about

3358.1 --> 3366.0499999999997
that's the ether that Tesla talked about

3361.59 --> 3366.05
that is the ether that is the real one

3373.26 --> 3382.0
and it's very tangible do betcha and

3379.569 --> 3383.89
it's not been conjured up by mathematics

3382.0 --> 3389.14
it's been actually been empirically

3383.89 --> 3395.41
measured oh I know if I'd already be

3389.14 --> 3398.2599999999998
real yeah yeah glean congratulations

3395.41 --> 3399.73
you're a baller now yeah you may think

3398.26 --> 3404.38
the earth is flat but you're a baller

3399.73 --> 3407.559
now fit in every just look at all the

3404.38 --> 3409.359
details ivory approach every cornerstone

3407.559 --> 3411.539
of your argument it's all ball our

3409.359 --> 3413.799
tactics all of it

3411.539 --> 3416.6800000000003
because you can't let go if your

3413.799 --> 3418.98
aberration just like gravity hey I did

3416.68 --> 3422.68
the same thing with gravity remember oh

3418.98 --> 3429.15
you were never a flat earther Wow okay

3422.68 --> 3432.239
well that's there you go there you go I

3429.15 --> 3432.239
[Music]

3432.24 --> 3438.779
do not know why I ever gave you a wrench

3435.369 --> 3438.779
but that's fine

3450.38 --> 3458.3
oh really agree that I truly do not know

3454.0 --> 3461.66
really so I truly do not know that the

3458.3 --> 3462.9700000000003
ether that people are talking about now

3461.66 --> 3466.67
in the Flat Earth scene has been

3462.97 --> 3469.4199999999996
conjured up specifically to account for

3466.67 --> 3473.2400000000002
light being presumed to be a wave I

3469.42 --> 3475.85
don't know let me say that I don't well

3473.24 --> 3480.5299999999997
I do know I do know that is exactly how

3475.85 --> 3482.48
it is that is what it is you can say all

3480.53 --> 3485.15
you but you don't know but we love to

3482.48 --> 3488.9
speculate please please talk about

3485.15 --> 3492.23
either ether the fantastical medium that

3488.9 --> 3494.63
we can't really see what light we think

3492.23 --> 3498.5
it's a wave so it must be there and

3494.63 --> 3503.38
mathematic we could do all know it's

3498.5 --> 3507.05
presupposed you have no physical

3503.38 --> 3509.96
physical scientific empiric evidence for

3507.05 --> 3514.9700000000003
ether you only have mathematical

3509.96 --> 3517.37
deduction based in direct evidence just

3514.97 --> 3519.8599999999997
like with gravity it's a little bit

3517.37 --> 3521.63
tougher than gravity but the gravity is

3519.86 --> 3524.81
pretty tough aberration right it's

3521.63 --> 3529.1600000000003
pretty tough machination so is the ether

3524.81 --> 3531.47
and it hasn't even it hadn't even it

3529.16 --> 3533.66
didn't even need to be constructed it

3531.47 --> 3536.48
just it's an aberration that naturally

3533.66 --> 3540.2599999999998
formed it's been festering on for 80

3536.48 --> 3542.87
years and more it still Fester's on

3540.26 --> 3547.9100000000003
right now in people people in my chat

3542.87 --> 3552.0499999999997
right now can't get it they can't see

3547.91 --> 3554.87
what they've done what has slipped in

3552.05 --> 3558.4100000000003
the foundation of what they're doing

3554.87 --> 3559.7599999999998
because they just love to move beyond

3558.41 --> 3561.35
that presuppositional point and just

3559.76 --> 3564.0200000000004
start fantasizing just like what the

3561.35 --> 3566.7799999999997
ball is do just like what the ballers do

3564.02 --> 3568.7599999999998
just move on those presuppositions and

3566.78 --> 3571.3100000000004
just work with that giant playground

3568.76 --> 3573.6200000000003
they want it so bad give me my

3571.31 --> 3578.68
playground just stop talking about the

3573.62 --> 3578.68
presuppositions hmm

3583.119 --> 3590.539
yeah sure it has been measured except it

3586.819 --> 3592.46
hasn't it has been reduced clean you

3590.539 --> 3594.619
have not measured the ether you know

3592.46 --> 3600.92
you're a liar you're a straight faced

3594.619 --> 3601.4
liar show me that show me the scientific

3600.92 --> 3604.39
proof

3601.4 --> 3613.0
show me the scientific experiment that

3604.39 --> 3614.569
proved the ether clean dough currently

3613.0 --> 3618.529
prove it to me

3614.569 --> 3624.049
give me your scientific experiment to

3618.529 --> 3627.289
prove the ether clean make sure you get

3624.049 --> 3629.089
the the hypothesis right make sure you

3627.289 --> 3631.849
get your independent variable and your

3629.089 --> 3637.67
dependent variable right to prove the

3631.849 --> 3640.279
ether clean or wait oh it's gonna be a

3637.67 --> 3643.94
little difficult now isn't it because oh

3640.279 --> 3646.509
oh oh it's all deduction based all wait

3643.94 --> 3648.65
it's mathematical extrapolations it's

3646.509 --> 3651.14
presuppositional conclusions or that's

3648.65 --> 3654.619
gonna be tough because she can't really

3651.14 --> 3656.769
very manipulate the independent variable

3654.619 --> 3661.7200000000003
in order to prove the ether no can you

3656.769 --> 3661.72
stuff can do it

3665.78 --> 3676.6600000000003
no you sure yeah you go ahead and find

3672.14 --> 3681.14
your 9033 experiment gleam you go ahead

3676.66 --> 3684.02
go ahead do it hey if you've got that

3681.14 --> 3687.44
experiment and it's actually viable then

3684.02 --> 3690.35
that probably means that that cue is

3687.44 --> 3693.53
gonna delete his channel pretty much but

3690.35 --> 3696.04
I doubt it I doubt that it's a viable

3693.53 --> 3700.46
hypothesis gleam I think that you are a

3696.04 --> 3706.0099999999998
spin doctor Pretender clown and a Fanta

3700.46 --> 3711.4700000000003
cyst and even self-admitted globe or how

3706.01 --> 3714.86
[ __ ] how dumb at this point well

3711.47 --> 3717.98
what kind of what kind of a resume for a

3714.86 --> 3720.44
true insight is that you're a proud

3717.98 --> 3724.01
globe or that you admit something as

3720.44 --> 3727.25
ridiculous as global 'if you think

3724.01 --> 3730.01
that's a viable ground for

3727.25 --> 3732.62
conceptualizing a conceptual medium

3730.01 --> 3735.7000000000003
called the ether clean I think that's a

3732.62 --> 3735.7
good foundation for that

3740.61 --> 3748.2200000000003
I don't abide by the theory of

3743.19 --> 3748.2200000000003
relativity at all currently nothing

3748.31 --> 3753.75
Einstein's pretty much all garbage to me

3751.05 --> 3757.26
so mathematical extrapolation garbage

3753.75 --> 3760.7
and the more I think about it so is a

3757.26 --> 3765.8700000000003
lot of conclusion conjecture concerning

3760.7 --> 3768.35
quantum mechanics and a lot out there in

3765.87 --> 3768.35
general

3777.73 --> 3782.41
oh you're another glow oh so you're just

3780.37 --> 3784.39
a liar then clean

3782.41 --> 3789.58
you're just a double speaking lying

3784.39 --> 3792.5499999999997
deceiver that is now banned because you

3789.58 --> 3793.21
think it's funny to basically tell me

3792.55 --> 3796.77
first

3793.21 --> 3801.85
that you're not a flat earther and and

3796.77 --> 3803.77
then basically make me say all these

3801.85 --> 3805.36
things presuming that you were talking

3803.77 --> 3808.98
the truth and then just flip it around

3805.36 --> 3812.26
well you're not welcome here anymore so

3808.98 --> 3815.64
I don't need your ether congestion

3812.26 --> 3815.6400000000003
garbage in here anyway

3838.27 --> 3842.989
no it's not

3839.84 --> 3842.989
[Music]

3849.45 --> 3855.4199999999996
now if you're undecided about the globe

3852.0 --> 3857.64
that's just as dumb look if you're just

3855.42 --> 3860.13
an outsider you know and you're trying

3857.64 --> 3862.65
to figure things out being on the side

3860.13 --> 3865.44
is okay but if you're gonna pretend like

3862.65 --> 3868.319
you're some knowledge expert concerning

3865.44 --> 3875.13
his subject and you're undecided that's

3868.319 --> 3878.549
just hipster [ __ ] attitude it's just

3875.13 --> 3883.4900000000002
[ __ ] what you're undecided but

3878.549 --> 3883.49
you're an expert at all this [ __ ]

3885.75 --> 3888.88
[Music]

3893.34 --> 3899.359
[Music]

3896.4 --> 3899.359
yeah

3924.01 --> 3930.26
well a heart of God yet I love expert

3928.339 --> 3932.839
yeah yeah yeah you can definitely call

3930.26 --> 3935.9900000000002
me that I call myself an expert yeah I

3932.839 --> 3939.8289999999997
am an expert I'm a layman expert the

3935.99 --> 3942.7299999999996
lifelong dedication pretty much societal

3939.829 --> 3946.579
financial self sacrifice in order to

3942.73 --> 3949.06
perfect my expertise religiously to

3946.579 --> 3952.9700000000003
dedicated to make it all worth it right

3949.06 --> 3955.849
yeah I am an expert and what does my

3952.97 --> 3958.609
opinion qualify me more than his well

3955.849 --> 3961.01
that I actually give the backdrop

3958.609 --> 3963.02
instead of injecting more fantasy

3961.01 --> 3965.42
garbage based on presupposition I

3963.02 --> 3967.099
actually show the foundation where all

3965.42 --> 3969.099
the misconceptions lay I put out all the

3967.099 --> 3972.26
data everything that's involved yeah

3969.099 --> 3975.79
that makes my opinion more qualified

3972.26 --> 3975.7900000000004
than his yeah

3989.68 --> 4000.2999999999997
well maybe you just don't have eyes to

3993.05 --> 4000.3
see article stupid name anyway

4002.61 --> 4010.81
definitely not a heart of gold or like a

4005.62 --> 4013.99
hardest [ __ ] because yeah you don't see

4010.81 --> 4015.88
what I come because probably you see

4013.99 --> 4021.1
very little because you're a dumbass

4015.88 --> 4023.26
I can wield this stuff you think I got a

4021.1 --> 4025.99
script with anything I'm saying no no I

4023.26 --> 4028.1800000000003
know this I am an expert and I trust

4025.99 --> 4030.43
myself I have confidence I have skill I

4028.18 --> 4033.0899999999997
still have my looks I have my youth I

4030.43 --> 4039.0099999999998
have my health I have a lot of things

4033.09 --> 4044.02
yeah what do you got what do you got

4039.01 --> 4049.1200000000003
buddy some shitty job a check nobody

4044.02 --> 4051.48
that really cares what do you got a sock

4049.12 --> 4051.48
account

4055.269 --> 4059.93
my biggest achievement in this community

4058.279 --> 4062.119
well let's just say the Internet

4059.93 --> 4066.259
community the YouTube community in which

4062.119 --> 4070.279
I'm not a huge part just a 1.65 CK

4066.259 --> 4074.72
subscriber right yet every freaking

4070.279 --> 4076.549
channel I go ever when I say something a

4074.72 --> 4078.2889999999998
chat there's a big chance I'm gonna be

4076.549 --> 4081.38
named if there is any live interaction

4078.289 --> 4083.2400000000002
because everybody knows me I figured it

4081.38 --> 4085.9990000000003
out every freaking buddy knows me for

4083.24 --> 4089.74
some reason they all know me that's what

4085.999 --> 4093.0789999999997
I've accomplished and and terminologies

4089.74 --> 4098.509
have you heard the terminology is that a

4093.079 --> 4101.06
lot of people are using right now where

4098.509 --> 4103.58
do you think they came from let's trace

4101.06 --> 4106.150000000001
it back very carefully because I have

4103.58 --> 4109.73
introduced quite a lot of terminologies

4106.15 --> 4112.4
into the knowledge base that we deal

4109.73 --> 4114.23
with on a daily basis but you don't have

4112.4 --> 4124.909
any eyes to see

4114.23 --> 4129.489
now do you I see it do you got anything

4124.909 --> 4129.489
else buddy before a ban you

4146.579 --> 4153.119
oh really you think begging for money

4149.579 --> 4159.5
and YouTube is not it's not an atom home

4153.119 --> 4164.94
way to live really so you think I should

4159.5 --> 4166.559
instead two completely different things

4164.94 --> 4169.25
rearrange everything that I am

4166.559 --> 4172.92
everything that my entire endeavor

4169.25 --> 4175.739
everything just give it all up to get

4172.92 --> 4177.929
some freaking standard job where

4175.739 --> 4180.15
everybody surrounding me is either gonna

4177.929 --> 4185.4
expect me to be a [ __ ] so they don't

4180.15 --> 4187.138999999999
have to feel like a dumbass or where

4185.4 --> 4189.629999999999
they literally are doing I could try to

4187.139 --> 4191.7300000000005
force the make me talk like differently

4189.63 --> 4193.4400000000005
you know that [ __ ] just take a little

4191.73 --> 4195.808999999999
bit extra money so they can take it all

4193.44 --> 4200.759999999999
away again through taxes and [ __ ] and

4195.809 --> 4203.969
then shove more rules on my ass right or

4200.76 --> 4207.3
or maybe I could just do something I'm

4203.969 --> 4212.4800000000005
really good at that I'm growing in

4207.3 --> 4215.309
visibly measurably yeah it's not just

4212.48 --> 4217.949
subscribers you know my subscriber base

4215.309 --> 4219.96
is a very poor indicator to my growth

4217.949 --> 4222.36
let's just be clear about that I have

4219.96 --> 4224.7300000000005
one of the worst slow growing subscriber

4222.36 --> 4227.308999999999
bases that I've ever come across it

4224.73 --> 4229.199
doesn't make any sense but yeah I've

4227.309 --> 4232.92
never really cared too much about

4229.199 --> 4235.379999999999
growing popularity I always found it to

4232.92 --> 4239.639
be more scary than something I'd longed

4235.38 --> 4244.71
for I just want to be heard by by good

4239.639 --> 4248.6990000000005
people that's all then I lost track of

4244.71 --> 4250.32
my sentence yeah this doing this doing

4248.699 --> 4254.78
something that I'm good at something

4250.32 --> 4254.78
that I'm developing something that I can

4254.84 --> 4261.03
do that I feel actually has a real

4257.849 --> 4266.179
influence that matters that'll actually

4261.03 --> 4270.0
change the minds of the world literally

4266.179 --> 4272.01
I'd rather do that and beg for money and

4270.0 --> 4274.079
get it from people that actually see the

4272.01 --> 4277.8
value in that and that can miss it

4274.079 --> 4279.08
and grow like that then doing some

4277.8 --> 4281.820000000001
really shitty

4279.08 --> 4284.01
depressing job that's gonna make me sick

4281.82 --> 4286.11
gonna make me force me to

4284.01 --> 4289.74
psychologically abandon every good thing

4286.11 --> 4292.589999999999
that I've ever built just to get a

4289.74 --> 4295.74
little bit more money and see I made

4292.59 --> 4298.32
this in society I got a check hey I'm

4295.74 --> 4302.01
not as stupid social welfare person

4298.32 --> 4308.7
anymore I'm miserable though you know

4302.01 --> 4310.79
that's gonna help no no I prefer asking

4308.7 --> 4315.87
people for money on the internet and

4310.79 --> 4318.96
doing this and by the way you're talking

4315.87 --> 4324.78
about that guys gals please do support

4318.96 --> 4327.87
me I do kind of need it either yeah I've

4324.78 --> 4330.719999999999
gone a long way on the donations from

4327.87 --> 4336.63
recently but I've kind of literally run

4330.72 --> 4338.7300000000005
out now so it would be very nice if yeah

4336.63 --> 4341.37
if you could spare some if you can't

4338.73 --> 4344.37
I'll try to figure it out but yeah I

4341.37 --> 4347.25
definitely do back for money and it's

4344.37 --> 4349.71
kind of odd in a way it feels a lot to

4347.25 --> 4353.91
me everyday because I technically see

4349.71 --> 4358.2
like bums the same people on the street

4353.91 --> 4363.21
begging for money and they get they get

4358.2 --> 4367.679999999999
barely anything they do get something

4363.21 --> 4372.0
sometimes you know but I don't know it

4367.68 --> 4374.1
is this the same or am I actually more a

4372.0 --> 4375.66
like a street performer because say if a

4374.1 --> 4376.8
street perform is really good now the

4375.66 --> 4378.51
weather has to be good that's the

4376.8 --> 4380.16
problem with street performing you know

4378.51 --> 4382.860000000001
though if the weather shitty then the

4380.16 --> 4385.5
street performers gonna have problems or

4382.86 --> 4388.44
I'm on inside so I don't have that

4385.5 --> 4390.72
problem and I am performing I am doing

4388.44 --> 4394.589999999999
something consistently on a daily basis

4390.72 --> 4400.22
people can expect me to be here at this

4394.59 --> 4403.650000000001
specific time every day and that is

4400.22 --> 4408.71
worth something as well that is that

4403.65 --> 4411.99
makes me a commodity in the world

4408.71 --> 4416.31
so yeah I think that I definitely do

4411.99 --> 4418.62
deserve donations I'm not ashamed of it

4416.31 --> 4420.650000000001
anymore I thought it was a bit scary at

4418.62 --> 4420.65
first

4426.669 --> 4435.82
yeah it's time for you [ __ ] to get
