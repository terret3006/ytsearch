whatever

753.48 --> 757.44
I mean it's been ages since they done

755.639 --> 761.32
even done that but I mean I guess they

757.44 --> 764.1990000000001
can find new videos to where I talked

761.32 --> 766.8000000000001
about some medical experiment related

764.199 --> 768.3599999999999
subject and then yeah they they want to

766.8 --> 774.0
take all of that

768.36 --> 777.76

1010.16 --> 1017.0
I'm sure a lot of people do that and I

1012.68 --> 1017.0

1026.52 --> 1030.9189999999999

internet will be back to normal again

1175.0 --> 1180.919

1178.799 --> 1183.2

forward to that is the first time I'm

1243.799 --> 1246.76
actually having him

over but uh yeah that should be

1256.96 --> 1263.72
interesting episode 9 1934 hell of a lot

1260.48 --> 1263.72
of episodes yeah I

1275.84 --> 1281.24

1281.24 --> 1286.88
lot had a lot of subjects I went through

1297.679 --> 1303.0
and I still talk about them of course

1299.919 --> 1307.279
but I mean yeah whenever it comes

1303.0 --> 1307.279
up no I'm not going to have a

1308.2 --> 1313.76
disc why why would I want that app

1311.4 --> 1316.159
debatable D I don't even have a

1313.76 --> 1319.44
smartphone and like I'm not going to pay

1316.159 --> 1319.44
for that

1320.159 --> 1325.0
yeah I didn't invite him to like oh I

1322.96 --> 1327.6000000000001
want to buy into everything I just

1325.0 --> 1330.08
wanted to have a

1327.6 --> 1333.559
talk yeah thanks thanks for all the

1330.08 --> 1333.559
recommendations I don't need

1347.159 --> 1350.3200000000002
any how many many years have I been

1349.4 --> 1352.279
doing

1350.32 --> 1355.279
this

1352.279 --> 1355.279
eight

1356.36 --> 1362.8799999999999
roughly for my chat

1359.88 --> 1362.88
oh

1364.76 --> 1371.679
uh maybe maybe I'll ask when when it

1369.6 --> 1375.4399999999998
happens may maybe he will have some kind

1371.679 --> 1375.44
of disc I don't know

1387.48 --> 1390.559
sure he's going to bring it

1394.679 --> 1400.8400000000001
up no and he's not going to just plug

1398.72 --> 1403.279
his app all the time that's not what

1400.84 --> 1403.279
we're going to

1405.799 --> 1410.8799999999999
do it years long time yeah yeah I

1420.919 --> 1428.2
know and hopefully everything keeps

1424.279 --> 1433.64
going the way it does I might even get

1428.2 --> 1433.64
to the 3,000 subscriber Mark

1434.039 --> 1439.0
wow which is taking me forever

1447.159 --> 1450.48
a lot of people have come and

1451.679 --> 1457.1200000000001
gone so I don't care we're going to have

1454.72 --> 1460.48
a talk about Flat

1457.12 --> 1464.36
Earth not just go I didn't invite him

1460.48 --> 1466.3990000000001
over to just plug his

1464.36 --> 1469.52
app

1466.399 --> 1472.039
okay so you might want to stop poisoning

1469.52 --> 1472.039
the well

1483.76 --> 1491.919
here biggest moment in those eight years

1487.919 --> 1491.919
Jesus uh

1507.36 --> 1513.0
I I can't really think of one

1510.76 --> 1517.32
moment there's been plenty of good

1513.0 --> 1517.32
moments and there's been plenty of bad

1521.48 --> 1526.96
moments all socks are going to be gone

1524.559 --> 1529.72
I'm sure they are AIS there's a lot of

1526.96 --> 1533.159
them

1529.72 --> 1533.159
and they do that periodically

1549.679 --> 1555.48
anyway right

1552.48 --> 1558.3600000000001
thankfully cuz that should clear up my

1555.48 --> 1563.3990000000001
band list which is like filled with

1558.36 --> 1563.399
hundreds and hundreds of socer accounts

1605.159 --> 1611.3600000000001
doesn't look like they've become like

1607.919 --> 1611.3600000000001
what the hell

1638.32 --> 1642.039
how did that happen

1658.36 --> 1661.9189999999999
sorry I'm just looking through the band

1660.039 --> 1664.32
list and there's some people in there I

1661.919 --> 1668.64
don't know how they got

1664.32 --> 1668.6399999999999
there that's weird

1707.96 --> 1712.3600000000001
I I don't care about having a 100

1709.84 --> 1716.4399999999998
viewers Asis I really

1712.36 --> 1719.8799999999999
don't yeah and it's it's mostly it's all

1716.44 --> 1721.3600000000001
trolls so I'm not going to clear out my

1719.88 --> 1722.7600000000002
I'm not going to do that I'm not going

1721.36 --> 1729.039
to

1722.76 --> 1729.039
reset yeah just not going to do it

1747.64 --> 1754.519
okay I don't know why you bring up 82

1750.559 --> 1754.519
debatable D that's that's just

1757.84 --> 1762.12
rude I mean that that was just a very

1760.559 --> 1765.279
rough moment for

1762.12 --> 1768.7199999999998
me and

1765.279 --> 1770.799
uh yeah it's a notorious episode

1768.72 --> 1773.76
long

1770.799 --> 1775.9189999999999
ago and I'd appreciate if you didn't

1773.76 --> 1778.48
just bring it up because

1775.919 --> 1781.1200000000001
that's it's what a troll would do

1778.48 --> 1785.519
debatable so if you want to hang around

1781.12 --> 1785.5189999999998
my chat don't do that

1803.48 --> 1808.159
okay Caris cut ban that's weird

1813.96 --> 1821.3990000000001
hello oh just random don't [Â __Â ] you

1818.0 --> 1823.88
debatable D [Â __Â ] you now you're just

1821.399 --> 1826.279
lying you know you're

1823.88 --> 1830.5590000000002
lying I don't know what kind of mood

1826.279 --> 1833.64
you're in today you're lying stop it do

1830.559 --> 1833.6399999999999
that again I'll kick you

1846.399 --> 1853.76
out plan for the channel in the future

1850.12 --> 1853.76
uh vague plans I

1854.159 --> 1859.3990000000001
mean there's a good chance I'll stop the

1856.799 --> 1861.48
early bird show at some Point depending

1859.399 --> 1863.6
on

1861.48 --> 1865.039
circumstances I kind of wanted to reach

1863.6 --> 1868.519
the

1865.039 --> 1870.84
2,000 but uh yeah the night owl shows I

1868.519 --> 1874.3990000000001
might I'm probably going to then carry

1870.84 --> 1876.48
on with those more they seem to be much

1874.399 --> 1878.799
more

1876.48 --> 1881.6
successful although I won't be doing

1878.799 --> 1881.6
that like every

1885.48 --> 1890.159
day but I don't know maybe I'll carry on

1888.159 --> 1892.0800000000002
with the early bird show it all

1890.159 --> 1894.6000000000001
depends

1892.08 --> 1898.639
like if I can

1894.6 --> 1900.24
get in a financially better position and

1898.639 --> 1902.9599999999998
things are

1900.24 --> 1906.519
improving but I mean I've had a very

1902.96 --> 1907.559
rough couple of years concerning that

1906.519 --> 1913.72
and

1907.559 --> 1913.72
uh yeah we'll we'll just figure it out

1919.559 --> 1926.0
now everyone's going to what not very

1922.48 --> 1926.0
bright excuse

1926.48 --> 1932.2
me yeah

1928.279 --> 1934.44
whatever yeah I yell I yell and I'm very

1932.2 --> 1936.279
angry and it and if you're a troll and

1934.44 --> 1939.8400000000001
you want to watch that go [Â __Â ] watch

1936.279 --> 1941.72
it I don't give a [Â __Â ] it's there it's

1939.84 --> 1944.12
happened years

1941.72 --> 1946.559
ago uh and it's not going to happen

1944.12 --> 1948.6789999999999
again it's pretty much when I broke open

1946.559 --> 1952.399
my rage win for the first

1948.679 --> 1956.76
time and it's behind me

1952.399 --> 1959.08
now so I don't know why you're talking

1956.76 --> 1960.679
to me like that but that makes me want

1959.08 --> 1964.24
to kick you

1960.679 --> 1967.279
out so better change that around or I'm

1964.24 --> 1967.279
going to start Banning

1968.279 --> 1973.519
people yeah you want to have a civil

1971.159 --> 1974.7990000000002
conversation that's fine you can be here

1973.519 --> 1976.44
in this chat and have a civil

1974.799 --> 1978.559
conversation you want to be a troll

1976.44 --> 1982.6390000000001
bastard I'll kick you the [Â __Â ]

1978.559 --> 1984.9189999999999
out yeah it's up to you I'm going to get

1982.639 --> 1987.1589999999999
my Illuminati C and coffee and I'll be

1984.919 --> 1987.159
right

2006.76 --> 2009.76
back

2036.72 --> 2040.76
e for

2092.639 --> 2099.119
no debatable D I don't want watch shitty

2096.119 --> 2099.119
channels

2101.68 --> 2107.68
yeah so hey did you watch some [Â __Â ]

2105.16 --> 2110.359
troll video on some shitty Channel I've

2107.68 --> 2113.7999999999997
never heard of the answer is

2110.359 --> 2113.7999999999997
no don't

2120.72 --> 2124.839
ask do I kind of wing it yeah I mostly

2123.44 --> 2127.88
wing it I mean there's plenty of

2124.839 --> 2129.4
subjects that I talk about

2127.88 --> 2133.079
but

2129.4 --> 2135.599
uh yeah I just like have to get to it I

2133.079 --> 2138.28
mean there's no regular scheduled

2135.599 --> 2140.839
subjects sometimes there is in certain

2138.28 --> 2143.8
periods when there's like interesting

2140.839 --> 2145.96
activity happening or something yeah

2143.8 --> 2149.2000000000003
something I bump into that makes

2145.96 --> 2154.4
me break open a

2149.2 --> 2156.0789999999997
subject or some new research but like uh

2154.4 --> 2160.52
earlier this month there was a whole

2156.079 --> 2165.04
bunch of stuff concerning the eclipses

2160.52 --> 2165.04
and all that and just ideas I had about

2169.04 --> 2175.96
that well

2171.2 --> 2180.7599999999998
aiz as far as I'm concerned she is a

2175.96 --> 2180.76
troll it's it's crap

2188.2 --> 2191.359
don't do that party

2193.2 --> 2199.359
fish this is

2195.52 --> 2202.359
not your channel to troll yeah go to

2199.359 --> 2205.52
[Â __Â ] flat SIDS and troll the [Â __Â ] out

2202.359 --> 2207.96
of it with your shitty remarks just go

2205.52 --> 2211.04
there then this is not the show for

2207.96 --> 2213.92
that yeah I'm really running out of

2211.04 --> 2213.92
patience with you

2216.52 --> 2221.28
guys does it stay fresh to me or do I

2219.92 --> 2223.6800000000003
get bored

2221.28 --> 2226.7200000000003
sometimes

2223.68 --> 2229.48
uh well usually I figure out something

2226.72 --> 2233.0
interesting to talk

2229.48 --> 2236.56
about but I mean yeah I mean sometimes

2233.0 --> 2238.72
yeah I do get a bit bored but whatever

2236.56 --> 2241.319
can't always be perfect if you do a show

2238.72 --> 2244.359
every single day you

2241.319 --> 2247.92
know but I mean there's been plenty of

2244.359 --> 2247.92
interesting shows

2251.56 --> 2258.359
and there's whole waves of exper of uh

2255.88 --> 2261.4
inspiration sometimes like get really

2258.359 --> 2263.92
inspired within Spirit

2261.4 --> 2266.48
mechanics like discovering the technique

2263.92 --> 2266.48
was very

2268.8 --> 2274.7200000000003
inspiring right like talking about

2271.8 --> 2279.44
Rudolph Steiner is always

2274.72 --> 2279.4399999999996
interesting to me at least

2285.76 --> 2293.92
uh when yeah when uh Flat Earth gets

2289.96 --> 2293.92
some mainstream attention that can be

2296.24 --> 2301.2
interesting but sometimes it's just like

2298.8 --> 2305.2000000000003
a newcomer comes

2301.2 --> 2307.96
in and asks questions like from a bit of

2305.2 --> 2310.7599999999998
a baller perspective but because they're

2307.96 --> 2313.68
just the Normie they don't really know

2310.76 --> 2316.92
and those can be really interesting

2313.68 --> 2318.7999999999997
shows I just give a a fresh explanation

2316.92 --> 2321.28
to a

2318.8 --> 2323.319
newcomer because there's plenty of

2321.28 --> 2325.92
things to talk

2323.319 --> 2328.599
about concerning Flat Earth and the

2325.92 --> 2332.28
mechanics of it and how the ball Earth

2328.599 --> 2332.28
doesn't really work

2340.64 --> 2345.04
right and there's plenty of things to

2342.44 --> 2348.64
criticize out there as

2345.04 --> 2351.599
well like flat earthers that are like

2348.64 --> 2353.2799999999997
onto other subjects

2351.599 --> 2356.28
and

2353.28 --> 2361.3190000000004
that could be considered to

2356.28 --> 2361.3190000000004
discredit Flat Earth all that

2367.88 --> 2372.0
okay Lucas home that's cool yeah

2380.28 --> 2384.8390000000004
welcome Flat Earth doesn't affect your

2382.64 --> 2387.839
day-to-day

2384.839 --> 2387.839
life

2390.839 --> 2397.359
okay if you really talk about it all the

2393.56 --> 2400.359
time then then it will but yeah I get it

2397.359 --> 2400.359
for

2414.13 --> 2417.329
[Music]

2439.88 --> 2445.52
right so everybody that found their way

2442.68 --> 2446.9199999999996
here don't forget to rogans it up thumb

2445.52 --> 2449.96
up the

2446.92 --> 2452.839
show and share

2449.96 --> 2456.0
it and if you have any

2452.839 --> 2459.4
questions that specifically

2456.0 --> 2462.079
relate to to the Earth to Flat Earth the

2459.4 --> 2463.7200000000003
globe arguments or there's some I don't

2462.079 --> 2466.88
know there's always some kind of rocket

2463.72 --> 2471.359
launch or whatever happening

2466.88 --> 2471.359
somewhere you can ask about

2478.48 --> 2485.88
that okay hello hi

2481.68 --> 2485.8799999999997
keaster guy for20

2491.28 --> 2494.0400000000004
eight years into this what's the most

2492.88 --> 2495.88
important thing you could say to a

2494.04 --> 2498.88
newcomer like

2495.88 --> 2498.88
myself

2499.0 --> 2507.0
uh well the Earth is flat it's measured

2504.16 --> 2510.7999999999997
flat Celestial

2507.0 --> 2514.56
navigation was originally done using

2510.8 --> 2518.52
flat baselines of of a of a flat plane

2514.56 --> 2518.52
with an angle to the Stars

2518.88 --> 2525.56
uh second law of

2522.599 --> 2530.6400000000003
Thermodynamics dictates because it's a

2525.56 --> 2532.839
natural law that gas pressure requires

2530.64 --> 2535.56
containment and with containment that

2532.839 --> 2538.0789999999997
means physical

2535.56 --> 2541.119
containment and thus outer space cannot

2538.079 --> 2541.119
be real as they

2545.16 --> 2550.359
claim gravity is

2547.76 --> 2551.92
pseudo science it's still perpetuated a

2550.359 --> 2555.88
lot even within

2551.92 --> 2557.6800000000003
physics people and that is really absurd

2555.88 --> 2560.359
when you think about it because there is

2557.68 --> 2562.8799999999997
no scientific evidence for it

2560.359 --> 2566.68
whatsoever and even the

2562.88 --> 2568.92
researchers over this Century are still

2566.68 --> 2571.5589999999997
trying to figure it

2568.92 --> 2577.76
out because it just has to be because

2571.559 --> 2577.76
the heliocentric Universe can't be

2577.92 --> 2582.0
properly

2579.96 --> 2584.8
constructed without

2582.0 --> 2588.359
it that's where things like dark matter

2584.8 --> 2591.48
Dark Energy came from to even out the

2588.359 --> 2591.48
math that's completely

2592.16 --> 2600.3999999999996
broken no gravity is not a

2595.76 --> 2600.4
law absolutely not

2609.88 --> 2614.079
like it's nothing literally

2616.079 --> 2622.88
nothing there is no law there's Newton's

2620.64 --> 2627.52
law but that's only within his

2622.88 --> 2627.52
presupposed model that's been officially

2628.8 --> 2635.599
discarded and it hasn't really been

2631.68 --> 2638.1189999999997
replaced in Einstein gravity sud sud

2635.599 --> 2640.1600000000003
ronian Force Space based Gra gravity was

2638.119 --> 2642.04
kind of suggested to replace it but I

2640.16 --> 2644.359
mean it's mathematical concept that

2642.04 --> 2648.92
doesn't take place in physical

2644.359 --> 2651.119
reality and doesn't have any physical

2648.92 --> 2654.079
evidence for it either it's just a

2651.119 --> 2656.76
thought experiment based system and it

2654.079 --> 2656.76
doesn't prove

2658.04 --> 2668.68
anything right so in the mean time there

2662.88 --> 2672.079
is density Theory or relative density

2668.68 --> 2676.2
and that explains the vertical passive

2672.079 --> 2679.2400000000002
displacement of objects and

2676.2 --> 2682.359
substances based on their

2679.24 --> 2685.7999999999997
density in relation to the density of

2682.359 --> 2687.5989999999997
the medium they are in and that works

2685.8 --> 2689.8390000000004
that is scientifically valid to the

2687.599 --> 2691.6800000000003
point where it can be considered a

2689.839 --> 2695.48
natural law because it

2691.68 --> 2699.3999999999996
is always functional there's no

2695.48 --> 2702.72
exception to it and yeah gravity is

2699.4 --> 2702.7200000000003
Superfluous as an

2702.839 --> 2708.52
idea yeah I know Newton's law of

2705.559 --> 2712.88
universal gravitation it's officially

2708.52 --> 2715.68
debunked that's debunked a century

2712.88 --> 2719.6400000000003
ago

2715.68 --> 2719.64
like they teach that at

2719.76 --> 2725.6800000000003
University I mean I know we still get

2722.2 --> 2728.96
Newtonian mechanics in middle school and

2725.68 --> 2728.96
all that

2729.88 --> 2735.6400000000003
but that's just part of a thought

2733.0 --> 2737.319
experiment based considerations that are

2735.64 --> 2740.48
just in the

2737.319 --> 2743.68
curriculum officially it isn't actually

2740.48 --> 2743.68
true it's not

2744.599 --> 2750.48
science yeah just because it's Newton's

2747.559 --> 2755.0400000000004
law doesn't mean that it is natural law

2750.48 --> 2755.04
or legitimate physics

2762.31 --> 2768.16
[Music]

2765.44 --> 2771.2400000000002
then who debunked it well officially

2768.16 --> 2771.24
Einstein debunked

2776.559 --> 2784.0
it but I mean at the time a century ago

2780.44 --> 2787.839
there was widely figured out that mass

2784.0 --> 2790.28
doesn't attract mass and mass itself

2787.839 --> 2793.359
is a derived concept

2790.28 --> 2797.8390000000004
that that isn't even like legitimate

2793.359 --> 2801.88
it's it's a derivative it's derived from

2797.839 --> 2804.359
density and mass on its own isn't even a

2801.88 --> 2806.88
legitimate thing that could cause a

2804.359 --> 2806.88
natural

2809.0 --> 2813.24
phenomenon so there is no Mass

2811.68 --> 2817.04
attracting

2813.24 --> 2820.359
mass and Newtonian mechanics is is

2817.04 --> 2822.599
debunked in that sense and also the

2820.359 --> 2826.48
entire system Newtonian mechanics

2822.599 --> 2830.2400000000002
completely excludes natural gas

2826.48 --> 2831.88
behavior basically ignores gas behavior

2830.24 --> 2835.24
outside of

2831.88 --> 2838.0
friction friction that gas poses when an

2835.24 --> 2840.3999999999996
object moves through it is

2838.0 --> 2842.599
uncalculated and that's it that's the

2840.4 --> 2847.6800000000003
only thing

2842.599 --> 2847.6800000000003
that's even relates to gas

2848.8 --> 2851.4
hello Craig

2852.64 --> 2859.16
brunzel oh you got it

2854.88 --> 2859.1600000000003
right local holographic angular

2861.52 --> 2865.68
manifestation ever heard the standing on

2863.8 --> 2867.88
the shoulder of giants yes I've heard of

2865.68 --> 2867.8799999999997
that

2869.72 --> 2877.04
saying didn't get taught that un I

2873.48 --> 2878.079
don't [Â __Â ] debatable d

2877.04 --> 2879.7599999999998
don't know what the hell kind of

2878.079 --> 2884.28
University you went

2879.76 --> 2888.44
to but uh they teach physics they don't

2884.28 --> 2888.44
teach you Newtonian mechanics

2909.8 --> 2913.44
are you talking about did Gary do

2915.72 --> 2921.7599999999998
music you need Mass to define density no

2919.0 --> 2924.76
you don't you need density to Define

2921.76 --> 2924.76
mass

2938.079 --> 2944.599
yeah mass is a derived concept that's

2941.48 --> 2947.359
right it's a derived concept it's on its

2944.599 --> 2949.559
own it isn't anything it's not actually

2947.359 --> 2949.5589999999997
a

2960.4 --> 2968.119
thing oh yeah I'm sure you did the bable

2963.24 --> 2971.5589999999997
D I'm sure you still used it

2968.119 --> 2975.4
I mean you can use Newtonian mechanics

2971.559 --> 2979.599
to a certain degree without too much

2975.4 --> 2982.04
issue but it's not proper physics it's

2979.599 --> 2983.839
not properly recognized as

2982.04 --> 2986.24
physics yeah if you're going to make

2983.839 --> 2990.0
some paper with a scientific claim and

2986.24 --> 2993.72
you use Newtonian gravity within it uh

2990.0 --> 2993.72
you're going to have problems

3002.72 --> 3010.2
what is density then density is a

3006.4 --> 3010.2000000000003
property of matter

3027.0 --> 3033.92
Mass intrinsic property of M yeah but it

3029.119 --> 3036.92
isn't Greg Brunel it isn't that it's not

3033.92 --> 3036.92
intrinsic

3039.2 --> 3043.04
cuz like it can

3043.2 --> 3048.839
change right the state of matter will

3047.44 --> 3052.319
effectively

3048.839 --> 3054.839
change that so it's not an intrinsic

3052.319 --> 3054.839
property of

3055.2 --> 3062.1189999999997
matter Mass

3057.24 --> 3065.2799999999997
is a calculated derived

3062.119 --> 3066.48
property yeah I you can keep saying it

3065.28 --> 3069.6400000000003
keep saying

3066.48 --> 3072.0
it it's not going to make it a separated

3069.64 --> 3072.0
thing

3076.44 --> 3084.0
yeah that you can't just measure the

3079.64 --> 3088.1189999999997
mass of anything you can only derive it

3084.0 --> 3089.64
after you attain the density

3088.119 --> 3091.92
that's a

3089.64 --> 3095.52
fact

3091.92 --> 3100.96
yeah there's no force of

3095.52 --> 3104.16
gravity to which mass is being

3100.96 --> 3106.88
subjected I know the new no to mechanics

3104.16 --> 3106.8799999999997
I know how they

3107.76 --> 3112.559
work it's it's not physics

3119.68 --> 3124.44
yeah yeah programming that's very cute

3121.559 --> 3127.88
debatable D are you going to keep doing

3124.44 --> 3131.04
this yeah you already started out being

3127.88 --> 3133.799
quite an [Â __Â ] in my

3131.04 --> 3138.7599999999998
chat you want to get kicked out

3133.799 --> 3138.7599999999998
today cuz you're pushing it

3145.44 --> 3148.539
[Music]

3149.799 --> 3153.799
did I do physics at school yeah I

3159.4 --> 3164.7200000000003
did sorry yeah sorry Lucas Holmes I'm

3162.28 --> 3167.6800000000003
just trying to address the bald tards in

3164.72 --> 3170.7599999999998
my chat because they're spouting their

3167.68 --> 3172.839
propaganda hor [Â __Â ] based on their

3170.76 --> 3177.6800000000003
tenacious ball

3172.839 --> 3182.0789999999997
belief and uh yeah I'm addressing that I

3177.68 --> 3184.799
mean if you wanted to have me explain it

3182.079 --> 3187.1600000000003
then yeah I could do that I am trying to

3184.799 --> 3192.0
do that but I mean these ballards just

3187.16 --> 3192.0
keep blabbering through it in my

3192.28 --> 3199.52
chat yeah yeah may maybe hey maybe I'll

3197.04 --> 3205.359
just give you a 30 minute timeout

3199.52 --> 3205.359
debatable D to just shut your Yap

3213.46 --> 3216.71
[Music]

3220.68 --> 3224.72
don't listen to him I'm

3224.839 --> 3231.799
not doesn't matter like the debunk is

3228.72 --> 3234.799
the debunk it's just been attributed to

3231.799 --> 3234.799
Einstein

3237.24 --> 3243.1189999999997
yeah Einstein was a a

3239.72 --> 3246.5989999999997
clown and he stole a lot of ideas but I

3243.119 --> 3249.319
mean he stole it from people that were

3246.599 --> 3252.079
working on it he's just been attributed

3249.319 --> 3254.92
in history as being the one to

3252.079 --> 3258.4
officially replace Newtonian

3254.92 --> 3261.359
mechanics with his form of gravity with

3258.4 --> 3263.88
which is based on Space SpaceTime

3261.359 --> 3267.0789999999997
bending and it's just a mathematical

3263.88 --> 3271.28
concept there is basically nothing to it

3267.079 --> 3275.599
other than the officially recognized

3271.28 --> 3278.1600000000003
density Theory also known as specific

3275.599 --> 3283.76
gravity it's kind of put in the corner

3278.16 --> 3283.7599999999998
but that is scientifically legitimate

3303.04 --> 3308.319
Adams have mass no you're mixing it all

3305.72 --> 3311.8799999999997
up in a giant mess Greg

3308.319 --> 3313.7599999999998
runzel yeah atomic mass is something

3311.88 --> 3318.6400000000003
completely

3313.76 --> 3318.6400000000003
different yeah it's a ratio based

3319.2 --> 3327.24
system that's different from Newtonian

3322.96 --> 3327.2400000000002
mechanics based Mass

3328.4 --> 3330.7200000000003
it's

3335.079 --> 3339.079
different yeah Greg is anatomist what's

3338.079 --> 3341.7200000000003
Mass

3339.079 --> 3346.0
exactly well it's what you derive from

3341.72 --> 3346.0
density yeah yeah that's that's cute I

3352.319 --> 3357.2
know yeah it I think it's balard Banning

3355.96 --> 3360.079
time

3357.2 --> 3362.359
that's cool don't worry I'll kick you

3360.079 --> 3362.3590000000004
all

3365.559 --> 3371.079
out don't worry about it Lucas don't

3368.48 --> 3373.559
worry don't worry there's just a lot of

3371.079 --> 3374.52
triggered funy [Â __Â ] in the chat

3373.559 --> 3377.559
right

3374.52 --> 3378.48
now and every time this comes up they

3377.559 --> 3383.3590000000004
all

3378.48 --> 3383.359
get I have to I have to show you my

3383.76 --> 3388.2000000000003
conditioning and I just have to deal

3385.72 --> 3390.64
with it don't worry about it this is

3388.2 --> 3393.24
it's not about you you could just keep

3390.64 --> 3393.24
asking your

3394.079 --> 3399.079
questions but actually do ask questions

3396.88 --> 3402.44
don't just tell me I'm you're confused

3399.079 --> 3402.44
about it ask the

3410.75 --> 3418.24
[Music]

3413.64 --> 3418.24
questions try to be specific

3420.76 --> 3426.5200000000004
does the Flat Earth have

3423.52 --> 3426.52
edges

3431.92 --> 3439.2400000000002
nope no it's a contained realm the big

3436.039 --> 3443.0
reveal about it is no no you're not Greg

3439.24 --> 3444.52
Brun so you're try trying to be a

3443.0 --> 3447.599
Ballard

3444.52 --> 3451.559
whatever yeah maybe you're

3447.599 --> 3453.52
not debatable D certainly is just

3451.559 --> 3456.1600000000003
whatever just say whatever you need to

3453.52 --> 3459.16
say and just

3456.16 --> 3462.359
whatever right yeah but Flat Earth does

3459.16 --> 3465.8799999999997
not have edges that say false

3462.359 --> 3468.839
dichotomy based model that's been placed

3465.88 --> 3473.28
there by a flatter society as a

3468.839 --> 3474.96
misinformation piece to basically slip

3473.28 --> 3477.76
through

3474.96 --> 3481.839
and that it's supposed to be a flat

3477.76 --> 3481.8390000000004
Earth disc in outer space which is

3482.559 --> 3487.799
ridiculous that is not really well

3484.799 --> 3487.799
that's too bad

3489.76 --> 3495.7200000000003
then okay party fish 30 minutes get the

3494.44 --> 3498.039
[Â __Â ]

3495.72 --> 3501.48
out but you wanker one more time and

3498.039 --> 3501.48
you're just bad

3512.28 --> 3518.52
right but yeah there is no outer

3515.039 --> 3522.8390000000004
space second law of Thermodynamics

3518.52 --> 3525.0
entropy makes the conception the idea of

3522.839 --> 3528.319
outer space

3525.0 --> 3530.64
impossible because we experience gas

3528.319 --> 3534.839
pressure here on

3530.64 --> 3539.2799999999997
Earth and well gas pressure can't

3534.839 --> 3542.44
form if there is a open system towards a

3539.28 --> 3545.48
giant amount of available volume that

3542.44 --> 3549.16
is claimed to be a

3545.48 --> 3551.52
vacuum the gas will

3549.16 --> 3554.52
explosively move in all directions in

3551.52 --> 3557.48
order to fill the available space and

3554.52 --> 3559.96
then potentially form a gradient within

3557.48 --> 3564.48
the available space after it has settled

3559.96 --> 3564.48
with in the containment

3567.839 --> 3574.0789999999997
no no Frank nobody in their right mind

3571.64 --> 3576.2799999999997
that's it like a full-blown [Â __Â ]

3574.079 --> 3579.6400000000003
believes that the Flat Earth has

3576.28 --> 3583.559
edges don't don't shove that in here

3579.64 --> 3586.0789999999997
nobody does there's no flat earther in

3583.559 --> 3588.1600000000003
their right mind that isn't like a

3586.079 --> 3591.119
controlled opposition [Â __Â ] or just a

3588.16 --> 3593.839
deluded fool that believes that their

3591.119 --> 3596.76
Flat Earth has edges

3593.839 --> 3601.0
nobody don't say that

3596.76 --> 3601.0
don't don't roll your misinformation in

3602.44 --> 3605.44
here

3605.599 --> 3612.6800000000003
yeah the Flat Earth is a contained

3608.96 --> 3616.319
system there is a container of which the

3612.68 --> 3618.319
four dimensions we do not know we don't

3616.319 --> 3620.839
know it with

3618.319 --> 3624.359
certainty

3620.839 --> 3626.48
okay but there's people that think it's

3624.359 --> 3630.24
a dome it's a

3626.48 --> 3633.039
like a a demiere that surrounds us and

3630.24 --> 3636.5989999999997
the Earth is a flat disc in the middle

3633.039 --> 3640.2000000000003
of that Dome it's one idea of it but we

3636.599 --> 3643.119
can't truly be certain there's no

3640.2 --> 3643.96
conclusive evidence either way of even

3643.119 --> 3647.119
the

3643.96 --> 3650.039
orientation of the equator line which in

3647.119 --> 3653.44
a flat Earth disc model with that round

3650.039 --> 3655.44
Dome would have to be a circle there's

3653.44 --> 3658.28
no conclusive evidence that it is

3655.44 --> 3659.559
literally a circle like that it's one of

3658.28 --> 3663.6800000000003
my pet

3659.559 --> 3665.4
peeves that I've harped on about for S

3663.68 --> 3668.799
years or

3665.4 --> 3672.1600000000003
so and I believe that there is a little

3668.799 --> 3674.839
bit more strange situation going on I

3672.16 --> 3677.1189999999997
think that the available space of the

3674.839 --> 3680.64
realm is looping but I mean yeah that's

3677.119 --> 3682.6400000000003
a bit confusing to a newcomer so the

3680.64 --> 3684.319
point is is that we don't know the full

3682.64 --> 3686.5989999999997
dimensions of the

3684.319 --> 3688.44
containment but

3686.599 --> 3692.6800000000003
it cannot

3688.44 --> 3695.839
be millions or billions of miles or

3692.68 --> 3699.0389999999998
quadr or endless amounts as suggested in

3695.839 --> 3701.119
the outer space cosmology of

3699.039 --> 3704.48
heliocentrism because the gradient could

3701.119 --> 3707.6800000000003
never be able to pan out the way it

3704.48 --> 3710.839
does it wouldn't be the gas pressure

3707.68 --> 3713.44
that we are breathing every day it

3710.839 --> 3716.599
couldn't form in a container that was

3713.44 --> 3720.44
that big so there had has to be a

3716.599 --> 3724.76
limited available volume within the

3720.44 --> 3724.76
containment of the realm in which we

3725.319 --> 3730.799
reside

3727.64 --> 3733.7599999999998
and yeah that's

3730.799 --> 3737.279
it right so there is no

3733.76 --> 3740.48
Edge cuz an edge would only become

3737.279 --> 3743.2
relevant if you conceive of the Earth

3740.48 --> 3746.48
being a flat disc or

3743.2 --> 3749.68
something that is surrounded by outer

3746.48 --> 3752.799
space but no flat earther that actually

3749.68 --> 3755.8799999999997
has done an inkling of research claims

3752.799 --> 3756.96
that it's only the Flat Earth Society

3755.88 --> 3759.76
controlled

3756.96 --> 3761.64
opposition group that makes these kind

3759.76 --> 3763.8390000000004
of

3761.64 --> 3766.4
claims all the flat earthers that have

3763.839 --> 3767.72
done actual research especially like

3766.4 --> 3770.7200000000003
since

3767.72 --> 3774.0
2015

3770.72 --> 3776.4399999999996
YouTube uh Flat Earth movement like none

3774.0 --> 3778.92
of them actually claimed that it's

3776.44 --> 3781.799
always been a

3778.92 --> 3783.88
ridiculing opposition claim that's been

3781.799 --> 3786.0389999999998
put forward by ball Believers like oh

3783.88 --> 3789.2000000000003
you believe where's the edge where's the

3786.039 --> 3791.7200000000003
edge yeah there isn't any Edge we're in

3789.2 --> 3795.3999999999996
a containment there's no outer space

3791.72 --> 3795.3999999999996
that surrounds us so there's no

3795.44 --> 3799.4
Edge right either there is a barrier at

3798.559 --> 3803.119
some

3799.4 --> 3805.279
point that surround us or there's even

3803.119 --> 3809.2400000000002
something stranger going on and there is

3805.279 --> 3812.48
simply we're like in a looping

3809.24 --> 3816.1189999999997
Continuum the available space may be

3812.48 --> 3819.319
interconnected with itself which could

3816.119 --> 3820.76
be compared to I don't know if you've

3819.319 --> 3825.279
seen the

3820.76 --> 3829.8390000000004
movie The Matrix the second one Matrix

3825.279 --> 3833.359
Reloaded in which Neo gets stuck in the

3829.839 --> 3836.0
train man station outside of the regular

3833.359 --> 3839.16
matrix it's like a separate little mini

3836.0 --> 3840.96
realm a connecting realm within the

3839.16 --> 3844.5989999999997
Matrix

3840.96 --> 3845.92
simulation and then he tries to run out

3844.599 --> 3848.76
of the train

3845.92 --> 3851.559
station but then as he runs in a

3848.76 --> 3855.0
straight line he ends up exactly where

3851.559 --> 3857.3590000000004
he started that's a loop that's a

3855.0 --> 3859.44
available space there's no more space

3857.359 --> 3861.799
than this with like what I'm showing

3859.44 --> 3864.76
within my hands and it Loops it

3861.799 --> 3868.92
literally connects with itself a looping

3864.76 --> 3873.039
system oh I have a belief

3868.92 --> 3874.52
suspicion that the realm may be within

3873.039 --> 3877.76
such a looping

3874.52 --> 3879.52
system and in a looping system there is

3877.76 --> 3883.2400000000002
no

3879.52 --> 3888.079
barrier because the available volume is

3883.24 --> 3890.0389999999998
limited by the available volume which

3888.079 --> 3892.48
does not need to be within the

3890.039 --> 3895.3190000000004
dimensions of the loop contained

3892.48 --> 3898.599
physically because there's nowhere to go

3895.319 --> 3901.88
there's no where to go but onto

3898.599 --> 3904.119
itself and so there will be pressure

3901.88 --> 3906.599
within a looping system despite there

3904.119 --> 3909.279
not being a

3906.599 --> 3913.119
barrier where the

3909.279 --> 3918.119
loop is although there should then still

3913.119 --> 3918.119
be a barrier somewhere at the

3918.29 --> 3923.2
[Music]

3921.44 --> 3927.16
top

3923.2 --> 3931.64
right it's all about the available

3927.16 --> 3934.0389999999998
volume yes I know Frank I know he does

3931.64 --> 3934.0389999999998
that's

3935.599 --> 3942.92
fine no I didn't have any argument on

3939.2 --> 3942.9199999999996
fed I wasn't even on

3943.079 --> 3948.88
fed getting so mad it's going to quit

3946.839 --> 3950.52
yeah I heard I watched a little bit

3948.88 --> 3953.52
about it blue pill Evolution made a

3950.52 --> 3957.64
little video R runzel I

3953.52 --> 3957.64
know but uh

3959.559 --> 3963.6400000000003
whatever I mean they get into

3964.52 --> 3970.88
arguments why would we need a

3967.52 --> 3974.279
barrier uh because the gas is going to

3970.88 --> 3977.559
try to expand in all directions

3974.279 --> 3982.44
and there has to be a barrier or simply

3977.559 --> 3982.44
no more volume available that

3983.079 --> 3988.7200000000003
exists right and that could also be the

3986.16 --> 3991.8799999999997
case which makes I mean it all makes it

3988.72 --> 3991.8799999999997
more complicated to

3991.96 --> 3996.92
explain to a newcomer but yeah there

3994.96 --> 4000.16
could be simply

3996.92 --> 4003.96
imagine there is a

4000.16 --> 4007.16
box think of it is a simulation a box in

4003.96 --> 4009.079
which matter can exist it includes gas

4007.16 --> 4012.96
pressure objects

4009.079 --> 4016.2400000000002
whatever and outside of the box there is

4012.96 --> 4019.559
no space like nonone space

4016.24 --> 4021.839
so there's no available space well the

4019.559 --> 4025.119
gas might try to

4021.839 --> 4027.96
move there but it can't go there because

4025.119 --> 4031.079
there's no available space so non-space

4027.96 --> 4035.2
would effectively be like a barrier

4031.079 --> 4035.2000000000003
because nothing can go into

4035.76 --> 4041.8390000000004
it no more volume available so even

4039.96 --> 4045.039
though it wouldn't have to then be a

4041.839 --> 4048.0389999999998
physical structure to push back on the

4045.039 --> 4050.44
gas that would try to expand in all

4048.039 --> 4053.079
directions there would be no more

4050.44 --> 4056.2000000000003
available space so it's going to

4053.079 --> 4058.6800000000003
function then effectively as a barrier

4056.2 --> 4062.52
even though it's literally

4058.68 --> 4065.9199999999996
nothing not even empty space just

4062.52 --> 4068.92
nothing no volume in which matter can

4065.92 --> 4068.92
exist

4074.48 --> 4079.279
[Music]

4077.44 --> 4083.319
difficult to get your head

4079.279 --> 4085.279
around I'm sure it is is the moon inside

4083.319 --> 4087.079
the container as

4085.279 --> 4089.52
well

4087.079 --> 4091.8390000000004
well I don't think that the Moon is a

4089.52 --> 4094.839
physical

4091.839 --> 4094.839
object

4094.88 --> 4102.319
cuz there's no real tangible evidence

4098.52 --> 4102.319
other than suggestive

4102.64 --> 4109.839
visual yeah visual suggestion so

4106.319 --> 4113.759
but The Apparition of it what we get to

4109.839 --> 4117.359
see does appear to be within the

4113.759 --> 4120.12
available volume but I mean there's no

4117.359 --> 4121.88
approach of the Moon you can't actually

4120.12 --> 4125.5199999999995
get there the same goes for the Sun and

4121.88 --> 4129.319
all the celestial lights they are just

4125.52 --> 4133.359
lights and they aren't physically

4129.319 --> 4136.839000000001
anywhere provably there's specific

4133.359 --> 4139.96
angles that you will see those lights at

4136.839 --> 4141.64
depending on your location but there's

4139.96 --> 4145.359
no evidence that you can actually

4141.64 --> 4146.759
approach them there's no signs that

4145.359 --> 4149.2390000000005
perspective

4146.759 --> 4151.56
applies which means that if you approach

4149.239 --> 4153.919999999999
it the angular size of it gets bigger

4151.56 --> 4156.4400000000005
there is no evidence of this

4153.92 --> 4159.12
whatsoever there no recorded evidence

4156.44 --> 4161.08
that there's a angular size increase of

4159.12 --> 4163.759
the Moon because you're approaching it

4161.08 --> 4167.08
there's no Visual Evidence of

4163.759 --> 4169.839
that such evidence basically only exists

4167.08 --> 4172.44
within CGI rendered

4169.839 --> 4174.64
movies which of course the heliocentric

4172.44 --> 4177.839
model is heavily

4174.64 --> 4181.839
reinforced with computer generated

4177.839 --> 4184.6
Graphics so yeah the moon technically is

4181.839 --> 4186.48
just a light even though it seems like

4184.6 --> 4187.400000000001
it's some kind of physical object with

4186.48 --> 4191.0
the

4187.4 --> 4193.679
suggestive creater shadows and all that

4191.0 --> 4196.12
there's no evidence that it is an actual

4193.679 --> 4197.36
palpable physical object and the same

4196.12 --> 4200.84
goes for the

4197.36 --> 4205.96
sun there is however light

4200.84 --> 4208.88
manifesting at an angle and so it is my

4205.96 --> 4210.159
conviction although yeah I I can't prove

4208.88 --> 4212.84
it within

4210.159 --> 4215.199
physics that the celestial lights

4212.84 --> 4219.76
including the sun and the moon are

4215.199 --> 4224.08
non-local holographic angular

4219.76 --> 4225.96
manifestations that are perceived within

4224.08 --> 4229.679
the realm

4225.96 --> 4229.679
within the available volume of this

4230.88 --> 4235.96
realm right so I hope that clarifies it

4233.52 --> 4235.96
a little

4238.84 --> 4243.96
bit hope this journey

4241.239 --> 4246.678999999999
left happier

4243.96 --> 4249.88
place a bit I

4246.679 --> 4252.92
mean yeah Lucas Holmes I have to deal

4249.88 --> 4256.0
with Ballers all the time which is not

4252.92 --> 4258.159
exactly making me a lot happier because

4256.0 --> 4261.04
no matter how many times I explain all

4258.159 --> 4266.36
this they just never want to listen and

4261.04 --> 4266.36
they just try to blabber their

4266.76 --> 4271.320000000001
conditioned

4268.64 --> 4274.4400000000005
rhetoric through everything every time I

4271.32 --> 4274.44
try to explain these

4276.76 --> 4285.56
things oh you're going to oh

4280.92 --> 4290.159
you you're leaving that's too bad

4285.56 --> 4290.159000000001
I mean I can still answer more

4291.52 --> 4296.84
questions gas isn't expending in all

4294.0 --> 4300.8
directions the top M aest yeah it is yes

4296.84 --> 4300.8
it is Clary it definitely

4314.239 --> 4319.799999999999
is yeah the gas is still moving in all

4316.88 --> 4324.32
directions at Mount Everest it's

4319.8 --> 4326.4400000000005
just redistributing itself differently

4324.32 --> 4329.84
because of the temperature

4326.44 --> 4331.799999999999
influences that are very different there

4329.84 --> 4335.719
yeah there is a

4331.8 --> 4337.4800000000005
gradiation within the gases of this

4335.719 --> 4341.0
realm

4337.48 --> 4343.36
because there just is because very

4341.0 --> 4345.8
likely because of temperature influences

4343.36 --> 4349.719
which can be proven to have

4345.8 --> 4352.719
a gradia effect within a container yeah

4349.719 --> 4355.08
take a container filled with air you

4352.719 --> 4358.199
have a heat influence on one side and a

4355.08 --> 4361.719
cold influence on the other side uh at

4358.199 --> 4364.44
the cold side the pressure will decrease

4361.719 --> 4367.4800000000005
and on the hot side it will increase and

4364.44 --> 4371.08
it will stay that way now all the gases

4367.48 --> 4374.199
within that contained system are still

4371.08 --> 4377.5199999999995
moving in all directions it's it's still

4374.199 --> 4381.799999999999
moving but it

4377.52 --> 4383.4800000000005
will change its pressure Dynamics to

4381.8 --> 4385.6
form that gradient because of the

4383.48 --> 4388.0
temperature

4385.6 --> 4390.360000000001
influence the gases there are still

4388.0 --> 4392.36
freely moving in all directions it's

4390.36 --> 4395.88
just because of the temperature

4392.36 --> 4398.759999999999
influence behave slightly differently

4395.88 --> 4402.28
and become less pressurized near the

4398.76 --> 4404.12
cold Which is higher up like surrounding

4402.28 --> 4406.679
the Mount

4404.12 --> 4409.719
Everest compared to at ground level

4406.679 --> 4409.719
where the pressure is much

4410.08 --> 4418.08
higher yeah but uh all of that still

4415.28 --> 4420.5599999999995
requires containment because you can't

4418.08 --> 4423.5199999999995
have a gas pressure gradient forming in

4420.56 --> 4426.360000000001
any sort of way if there isn't a set

4423.52 --> 4430.080000000001
available volume for all the gas to move

4426.36 --> 4432.5199999999995
in equalize and then form the gradient

4430.08 --> 4436.12
because of pressure yeah because of

4432.52 --> 4441.080000000001
temperature influences can't form

4436.12 --> 4441.08
without a set amount of available

4442.719 --> 4448.08
volume anyway I'm going to take a bite

4444.76 --> 4448.08
out of this

4479.12 --> 4485.76
and no barrier I don't know what the

4481.6 --> 4485.76
hell you're talking about is this

4495.52 --> 4501.280000000001
yeah and Frank uh whatever is considered

4498.6 --> 4505.4800000000005
it is in vacuum that's all

4501.28 --> 4505.48
cute gradiation can only

4510.92 --> 4517.84
form that's ridiculous aiz that's

4513.48 --> 4517.839999999999
literally less than one person

4531.08 --> 4537.84
you might want to quit your nonsensical

4534.4 --> 4537.839999999999
output here before I

4537.88 --> 4543.12
just put you in the

4540.679 --> 4546.84
background yeah I'm not here to

4543.12 --> 4548.76
entertain this ridiculous

4546.84 --> 4553.8
attitude yeah everything that I've

4548.76 --> 4557.360000000001
explain is solid it's all effective

4553.8 --> 4557.360000000001
based on physics it's

4559.48 --> 4565.799999999999
real so vacuum can exist next to a

4563.4 --> 4567.4
pressure as long as it's inside a

4565.8 --> 4570.400000000001
container yeah depending on the

4567.4 --> 4572.879999999999
circumstances if you want to consider

4570.4 --> 4575.36
that lower pressure to be a vacuum yeah

4572.88 --> 4577.6
lower pressure can exist next to higher

4575.36 --> 4580.599999999999
pressure within a container that's

4577.6 --> 4580.6
correct

4586.78 --> 4589.92
[Music]

4587.96 --> 4591.639
there is a vacuum up there well if you

4589.92 --> 4596.4800000000005
want to think of it as a vacuum that's

4591.639 --> 4596.4800000000005
fine but that vacuum is not a vast outer

4596.84 --> 4604.04
space because a gradient is not going to

4599.92 --> 4604.04
redistribute itself like

4604.96 --> 4609.04
that in that amount of

4609.4 --> 4613.4
volume right

4636.36 --> 4643.0
and practically by the

4638.12 --> 4645.639
way you can't have a vacuum without a

4643.0 --> 4648.32
container

4645.639 --> 4648.32
can't have that

4650.88 --> 4656.4400000000005
either i' like to see you make a

4654.04 --> 4659.719
vacuum without a

4656.44 --> 4663.919999999999
container CU I don't think it will work

4659.719 --> 4663.92
making a vacuum is actually quite

4672.8 --> 4678.08
difficult edge of space is a container

4675.48 --> 4678.08
no it is

4679.239 --> 4684.32
not what the hell does the edge of space

4682.0 --> 4684.32
even

4689.8 --> 4698.88
mean available volume for gas to move

4694.04 --> 4698.88
into cannot be a container

4719.0 --> 4726.4
yeah elg it looks like a z needs

4723.04 --> 4728.56
to needs to tone it down or it'll kick

4726.4 --> 4728.5599999999995
you

4730.719 --> 4736.6
out space is not infinite yeah it's

4734.28 --> 4737.88
nonex existed there is no outer space

4736.6 --> 4742.88
there is

4737.88 --> 4744.8
no insanely vast volume

4742.88 --> 4747.92
available if there

4744.8 --> 4751.6
were then the gas we were breathing here

4747.92 --> 4754.0
on Earth would rapidly explode within

4751.6 --> 4757.2390000000005
like a millisecond it would explode away

4754.0 --> 4759.92
and we'd all immediately choke to

4757.239 --> 4761.199
death and the liquids in our bodies and

4759.92 --> 4764.4800000000005
on Earth and everything would

4761.199 --> 4766.759999999999
immediately start to evaporate turn into

4764.48 --> 4770.28
gas and that would also explode away in

4766.76 --> 4774.4400000000005
all directions and we would be

4770.28 --> 4774.44
left with no life

4774.96 --> 4779.199
whatsoever instantaneous

4777.28 --> 4782.599999999999
depressurization that's what would

4779.199 --> 4784.678999999999
happen but it isn't happening so there

4782.6 --> 4788.8
definitely is not that amount of

4784.679 --> 4788.8
available volume available

4804.88 --> 4811.88
okay goodbye AIS get the [Â __Â ] out

4808.88 --> 4811.88
[Â __Â ]

4832.199 --> 4837.32
but then if we make the container bigger

4834.92 --> 4839.8
it can't work anymore

4837.32 --> 4841.96
correct CU there has to be a very

4839.8 --> 4846.679
specific type of

4841.96 --> 4846.679
proportion yeah a

4847.28 --> 4851.96
gradient can only work in a specific way

4850.4 --> 4855.239
if there's a certain amount of available

4851.96 --> 4856.639
volume the gradiation can only work in a

4855.239 --> 4859.718999999999
certain

4856.639 --> 4864.4800000000005
way you can't

4859.719 --> 4866.96
have a tiny tiny tiny microscopic amount

4864.48 --> 4870.159
of volume in which there can be very

4866.96 --> 4872.56
high pressure which this is what we're

4870.159 --> 4875.5599999999995
breathing and then

4872.56 --> 4875.56
have

4875.6 --> 4880.92
99.999999% more volume have extremely

4878.8 --> 4883.2390000000005
low pressure right next to that it

4880.92 --> 4885.6
doesn't work that's not how

4883.239 --> 4888.5599999999995
gradiation gas pressure distribution

4885.6 --> 4891.96
resulting in gradiation works it will

4888.56 --> 4895.2390000000005
not redistribute itself in that form

4891.96 --> 4895.2390000000005
it's impossible

4914.679 --> 4922.56
so if you're all done with your

4918.44 --> 4924.44
pitiful attempts to try to ENT trap me

4922.56 --> 4926.400000000001
like you got some kind of gotcha and I

4924.44 --> 4929.12
don't know what I'm talking

4926.4 --> 4930.679
about we it would be nice to move on

4929.12 --> 4932.12
because I definitely know what I'm

4930.679 --> 4935.32
talking about I've been talking about

4932.12 --> 4935.32
this for eight [Â __Â ]

4936.34 --> 4939.409000000001
[Music]

4942.28 --> 4946.5199999999995
years outer space is fake

4948.12 --> 4954.96
oh Frank you want to get kicked out too

4952.12 --> 4957.36
H going to be a wise ass going to be

4954.96 --> 4957.36
smart

4964.32 --> 4972.12
mouth is this the last time you speak up

4966.88 --> 4972.12
in my chat Frank you want to go

4996.32 --> 5003.239
you'd rather not get kicked

4998.4 --> 5006.44
out okay well then get a

5003.239 --> 5006.44
grip okay

5013.0 --> 5017.96
it's what I always say no it's not what

5015.0 --> 5017.96
I always

5018.199 --> 5024.199
say that's what I say when I talk about

5021.48 --> 5026.0
my own specific

5024.199 --> 5028.759999999999
conceptions

5026.0 --> 5030.92
like non-local holographic angular

5028.76 --> 5035.280000000001
manifestations yeah there is no Citation

5030.92 --> 5038.76
for that I'm the one that named it

5035.28 --> 5041.5599999999995
I will be the citation in that and

5038.76 --> 5045.159000000001
neither for the conception of non-space

5041.56 --> 5049.0
there is no Citation for that nobody

5045.159 --> 5049.0
ever brought that up I named it

5049.639 --> 5056.96
such right and arguably with the looping

5055.08 --> 5059.6
systems as well although there are some

5056.96 --> 5061.12
other people that have laid down their

5059.6 --> 5063.84
own ideas about

5061.12 --> 5065.76
it I haven't come across anybody that's

5063.84 --> 5069.28
done it

5065.76 --> 5071.76
in detail enough for me to use them as

5069.28 --> 5071.759999999999
some kind of

5072.04 --> 5076.159
reference yeah but when I'm talking

5074.199 --> 5079.48
about plain

5076.159 --> 5081.32
physics like gas pressure distribution

5079.48 --> 5085.678999999999
within an available

5081.32 --> 5085.679
volume yeah that's I did not make that

5093.32 --> 5098.759999999999
up about a gradient needing a specific

5102.239 --> 5107.04
volume well a gradient is always going

5104.639 --> 5109.159000000001
to be in relation to the available

5107.04 --> 5110.36
volume I mean the gases are still going

5109.159 --> 5113.44
to be

5110.36 --> 5115.639
moving within the gradient in between

5113.44 --> 5119.159
the lower pressure zones and the higher

5115.639 --> 5119.159000000001
pressure zones they move

5121.679 --> 5128.159
freely yeah and there is a certain way

5125.48 --> 5131.159
that gradients of gas

5128.159 --> 5131.159
pressure

5132.76 --> 5139.719
manifest even when we try to recreate it

5136.36 --> 5144.799999999999
and it's not going to result in any form

5139.719 --> 5147.88
in a super thick gas pressure

5144.8 --> 5150.6
layer that's right next to a gigantic

5147.88 --> 5154.6
amount of super low

5150.6 --> 5156.159000000001
pressure there is nothing that is never

5154.6 --> 5159.04
been achieved

5156.159 --> 5160.119
physically to to demonstrate that it can

5159.04 --> 5162.96
do

5160.119 --> 5164.799999999999
that so it's going to

5162.96 --> 5166.8
be

5164.8 --> 5170.28
relatively

5166.8 --> 5174.0
linear maybe slightly

5170.28 --> 5178.119
curved ratio of gas pressure based on

5174.0 --> 5178.119
the entire volume available

5189.96 --> 5193.36
yeah debatable D I don't

5197.639 --> 5203.400000000001
care can it come can my descriptions

5201.32 --> 5206.5599999999995
cause some confusion I'm sure they can

5203.4 --> 5208.839999999999
and I'm right here to to explain why I

5206.56 --> 5211.0
use those words and I've done that many

5208.84 --> 5213.2390000000005
times and you were right there when I

5211.0 --> 5217.159
was doing it debatable

5213.239 --> 5217.159
d for

5258.32 --> 5264.599999999999
flatb birth realm has an unspecified

5260.84 --> 5267.32
volume no it's unknown not

5264.6 --> 5270.76
unspecified lar it's a very strange

5267.32 --> 5270.759999999999
thing to say

5274.28 --> 5282.239
I'm not getting angry to people because

5278.56 --> 5287.56
of an understanding issue debatable D

5282.239 --> 5287.5599999999995
yeah don't straw man me with your hor

5287.88 --> 5294.04
[Â __Â ] yeah I did not

5290.119 --> 5297.159
ban these people in my chat because they

5294.04 --> 5299.48
didn't understand I banned them because

5297.159 --> 5303.48
of their shitty attitude and their ad

5299.48 --> 5303.48
homs yeah

5304.28 --> 5311.759999999999
or because they're misquoting me lying

5307.719 --> 5314.2390000000005
about me that sort of thing don't become

5311.76 --> 5314.2390000000005
part of

5323.56 --> 5328.320000000001
that I didn't get angry to anybody for

5326.92 --> 5330.84
not

5328.32 --> 5332.759999999999
understanding that Lucas Holmes did not

5330.84 --> 5336.04
get angry at him at all and he had some

5332.76 --> 5336.04
trouble understanding

5364.88 --> 5370.96
yeah don't you worry about that Frank

5367.639 --> 5374.56
why don't you let me worry about how I

5370.96 --> 5374.56
conduct my show

5452.96 --> 5458.119
you think you're carrying the show well

5455.28 --> 5458.119
I'm carrying the

5461.8 --> 5468.56
show the wrenches don't carry the

5466.0 --> 5470.719
show I mean it's been great having them

5468.56 --> 5474.4800000000005
here I don't know what illg and clear

5470.719 --> 5474.4800000000005
are doing right now

5508.28 --> 5513.04
my volume would have to be consistent in

5510.92 --> 5515.84
it what does that mean LSG I don't

5513.04 --> 5515.84
understand what your

5539.04 --> 5545.84
say right

5541.52 --> 5545.84
anyway it's been good so far

5546.32 --> 5550.44
take a two minute break be right

5572.84 --> 5575.84
back

5602.76 --> 5605.76
e

5632.719 --> 5636.76
e for

5702.52 --> 5705.52
um

5730.36 --> 5738.04
what what do you mean increased volume

5732.44 --> 5738.04
don't you mean just increased pressure

5739.4 --> 5745.04
density Like A system that is

5742.28 --> 5748.239
heated

5745.04 --> 5750.56
can Will basically have more pressure

5748.239 --> 5753.0
right I mean that's the whole issue of

5750.56 --> 5754.4800000000005
the gradient at ground level there is

5753.0 --> 5756.719
more pressure because there is a lot

5754.48 --> 5756.718999999999
more

5757.199 --> 5761.678999999999
heat arguably I mean there is more heat

5760.48 --> 5764.799999999999
and

5761.679 --> 5767.6
heat subjected to a

5764.8 --> 5771.679
medium and cold on the other side will

5767.6 --> 5774.84
cause a higher pressure at the hot side

5771.679 --> 5776.76
versus the cold side so I don't know

5774.84 --> 5779.28
exactly what you mean about increased

5776.76 --> 5781.159000000001
volume I mean there is only a set amount

5779.28 --> 5785.5599999999995
of volume available you can't create

5781.159 --> 5785.5599999999995
more volume within a volume that's

5785.8 --> 5788.92
that doesn't make logical

5803.07 --> 5806.29
[Music]

5812.52 --> 5815.52
sense

5842.52 --> 5846.4800000000005
for for

5881.81 --> 5884.9890000000005
[Music]

5888.48 --> 5892.759999999999
okay oh things certainly have slowed

5893.76 --> 5898.92
down too bad I thought that we were

5896.52 --> 5898.92
doing

5900.48 --> 5905.44
great wish Lucas Holmes didn't just

5902.88 --> 5905.4400000000005
leave

5908.119 --> 5912.679
I mean I'd love to answer more

5913.199 --> 5919.119
questions that he might have I'm sure he

5916.119 --> 5919.119
does

5941.4 --> 5944.4
that

5986.04 --> 5990.88
okay yeah LSG I think I understand what

5988.52 --> 5994.080000000001
you're meaning you're talking about like

5990.88 --> 5996.92
a a pressure mitigator

5994.08 --> 5999.719
to prevent

5996.92 --> 6004.1990000000005
like it from basically

5999.719 --> 6006.679
pressing in a way that causes structural

6004.199 --> 6009.678999999999
damage right but that's pressure

6006.679 --> 6009.679
redistribution

6010.639 --> 6017.119
though that's within engineering I mean

6014.159 --> 6021.96
we're talking we were talking about the

6017.119 --> 6025.04
gas pressure system right here on

6021.96 --> 6029.28
Earth which as far as I know is not

6025.04 --> 6029.28
being like mechanically

6030.88 --> 6037.2390000000005
assisted the gradient is forming

6034.719 --> 6040.199
passively because of temperature

6037.239 --> 6043.4
influences within

6040.199 --> 6046.44
one volumetric

6043.4 --> 6049.719
unit and not different compartments that

6046.44 --> 6049.719
are separated

6054.04 --> 6059.96
but yeah there

6056.679 --> 6063.2390000000005
are Technologies like pressure

6059.96 --> 6066.76
redistribution Technologies to to do

6063.239 --> 6066.759999999999
that sort of thing

6112.239 --> 6116.199
look for

6169.56 --> 6174.4400000000005
okay well I guess that's the end of this

6171.44 --> 6174.44
segment

6177.36 --> 6182.4
too bad I thought it was something nice

6179.92 --> 6184.84
going I mean I'd love to explain more

6182.4 --> 6188.04
about the Flat Earth

6184.84 --> 6190.32
Dynamics the realm

6188.04 --> 6193.679
Dynamics see where I'm coming from yeah

6190.32 --> 6193.679
yeah yeah I know you

6195.0 --> 6200.199
do it's just such silly

6200.239 --> 6206.4
convictions I don't know like Cleary is

6203.4 --> 6206.4
kind of weird like

6209.639 --> 6214.719
that reminds me of spur schemo who

6212.48 --> 6216.678999999999
always used to argue like oh no there is

6214.719 --> 6219.8
basically an outer

6216.679 --> 6221.04
space you can have a a gas pressure

6219.8 --> 6224.679
without a

6221.04 --> 6227.76
container kind of thing is weird like

6224.679 --> 6231.719
yeah there's a gradient

6227.76 --> 6235.04
so so there can be infinite volume and I

6231.719 --> 6235.04
don't think so

6238.84 --> 6244.360000000001
I mean this should even be demonstrable

6241.44 --> 6248.5199999999995
not that I've personally done that but I

6244.36 --> 6251.839999999999
can conceive of a setup that would

6248.52 --> 6255.76
help basically

6251.84 --> 6258.8
explain how gradiation would work it

6255.76 --> 6261.679
would be the gradiation is directly

6258.8 --> 6264.679
based on the available

6261.679 --> 6268.4
volume right first the

6264.679 --> 6270.92
gas is released within the available

6268.4 --> 6272.96
volume it immediately explosively

6270.92 --> 6275.679
expands in all directions in order to

6272.96 --> 6278.679
even out with the available volume and

6275.679 --> 6280.4400000000005
then secondary effects can set in like a

6278.679 --> 6284.2390000000005
temperature influence like the gas is

6280.44 --> 6289.239
now there can be heated can be

6284.239 --> 6292.718999999999
cooled and then a gradiation

6289.239 --> 6297.959999999999
forms it's a secondary effect after the

6292.719 --> 6297.96
gas pressure has redistributed itself

6301.56 --> 6306.360000000001
evenly

6303.719 --> 6309.36
right but you could technically like

6306.36 --> 6311.28
have a volume a set

6309.36 --> 6313.32
volume in which there is this

6311.28 --> 6316.159
temperature influence cold on one side

6313.32 --> 6317.32
heat on the other a certain type of

6316.159 --> 6321.199
gradient

6317.32 --> 6325.4
pressure gradient will form within it

6321.199 --> 6326.638999999999
and then technically you could say let's

6325.4 --> 6331.96
stretch it

6326.639 --> 6334.92
up let's just like open up double the

6331.96 --> 6337.199
volume double the amount of total gas

6334.92 --> 6339.36
that is inserted in it so that you don't

6337.199 --> 6342.799999999999
like lower the pressure because the

6339.36 --> 6345.5199999999995
volume is doubled like double the volume

6342.8 --> 6347.0
double the amount of gas and then let's

6345.52 --> 6350.280000000001
see how the gradient

6347.0 --> 6353.199
forms within that still having the cold

6350.28 --> 6354.32
influence on one side hot on the other

6353.199 --> 6358.0
and then just

6354.32 --> 6360.159
keep keep enlarging the volume and the

6358.0 --> 6364.0
amount of gas and you'll start to notice

6360.159 --> 6366.839999999999
that the pattern it's going to be quite

6364.0 --> 6369.88
distinct right in a very small volume

6366.84 --> 6372.1990000000005
yeah the the gradiation might be

6369.88 --> 6374.2390000000005
relatively extreme like a very small

6372.199 --> 6376.96
volume there would be like more pressure

6374.239 --> 6379.919999999999
on one side than the other but if you

6376.96 --> 6386.04
stretch it up then eventually the

6379.92 --> 6386.04
gradiation will like match the total

6393.0 --> 6396.76
volume no party

6398.639 --> 6405.1990000000005
fish you're just being annoying that's

6402.44 --> 6405.199
why I timed you

6405.56 --> 6412.4400000000005
out so just stop doing

6409.52 --> 6413.639
that and hey if you want to talk you can

6412.44 --> 6417.32
talk

6413.639 --> 6422.56
if you're just here to be obtuse and

6417.32 --> 6422.5599999999995
annoying then I don't want you here

6464.44 --> 6468.799999999999
no it's not a reasonable question it

6466.4 --> 6472.48
wasn't you were literally getting in the

6468.8 --> 6474.8
way of an a newcomer that was genuinely

6472.48 --> 6477.839999999999
trying to understand things and you were

6474.8 --> 6480.679
just ramming your [Â __Â ] through that's

6477.84 --> 6483.159000000001
what you were doing and now he's gone

6480.679 --> 6483.159
thanks a

6483.44 --> 6490.598999999999
lot in the next time somebody new comes

6486.52 --> 6493.280000000001
in and just starts asking like genuine

6490.599 --> 6495.92
questions I'm probably just going to

6493.28 --> 6497.759999999999
kick all of you out all you ball Tarts

6495.92 --> 6499.599
I'm going to kick you all out because

6497.76 --> 6502.56
you will get in the

6499.599 --> 6504.76
way you will scare the newcomers away

6502.56 --> 6508.639
it's what you do you can't help

6504.76 --> 6508.639
it and I don't want

6509.0 --> 6517.04
it want the newcomer to be able to feel

6512.76 --> 6519.1990000000005
at ease and comfortable to ask their

6517.04 --> 6523.239
questions that they're not super

6519.199 --> 6526.598999999999
confident about right all you're

6523.239 --> 6531.48
bickering and forcing yourself in the

6526.599 --> 6531.4800000000005
chat like that gets in the way of their

6531.719 --> 6535.76
comfort for

6563.32 --> 6566.04
so there you

6566.92 --> 6574.36
go never me you don't have to mention a

6571.48 --> 6576.159
ball I know where where that question

6574.36 --> 6580.32
comes

6576.159 --> 6581.4
from don't don't pretend to me like you

6580.32 --> 6585.84
don't

6581.4 --> 6589.839999999999
know okay don't even try that [Â __Â ] with

6585.84 --> 6592.28
me I know how this works I know how that

6589.84 --> 6595.56
reasoning works I know the people that

6592.28 --> 6598.239
bring them up and why they bring it up

6595.56 --> 6600.76
so don't pretend like you oh I'm all

6598.239 --> 6605.32
innocent I I didn't mean anything you

6600.76 --> 6605.320000000001
[Â __Â ] off yeah that's why I timed you

6621.639 --> 6625.679
out for

6682.32 --> 6685.719
you is are used for

6688.0 --> 6691.32
density I don't

6708.159 --> 6715.4
know yeah generally mass divided by

6711.84 --> 6718.0
volume that's so they they say Gramps

6715.4 --> 6718.0
which is kind of

6722.239 --> 6727.04
weird gr per cubic

6734.8 --> 6739.320000000001
cm no answer I just answered

6740.76 --> 6746.96
you are you are you here to get me party

6744.0 --> 6746.96
fish you want to get

6749.639 --> 6757.400000000001
me got some retribution on your

6753.76 --> 6758.320000000001
heart how dare I time you out for being

6757.4 --> 6762.119
in the

6758.32 --> 6762.119
way scaring away

6767.4 --> 6772.04
newcomer I just told you

6782.92 --> 6787.96
yeah I mean I already addressed that by

6785.56 --> 6793.320000000001
the way

6787.96 --> 6793.32
earlier it's like yeah when you

6793.8 --> 6798.43
notify like when when you write it down

6797.32 --> 6800.32
yeah it's going to

6798.43 --> 6804.1990000000005
[Music]

6800.32 --> 6807.84
go Mass over volume

6804.199 --> 6807.839999999999
that's when you write it

6810.48 --> 6816.678999999999
down shouldn't be scary hey why don't

6813.76 --> 6820.2390000000005
you just stop with the [Â __Â ] attitude

6816.679 --> 6820.2390000000005
dude just stop

6822.199 --> 6826.879999999999
it it's not scary

6839.96 --> 6844.56
yeah I know how it's notified I know how

6843.679 --> 6848.1990000000005
it is

6844.56 --> 6851.320000000001
noted yeah that doesn't

6848.199 --> 6855.598999999999
prove that those things

6851.32 --> 6855.599
exist physically

6857.079 --> 6863.92
separately yeah it's just how it's

6860.84 --> 6868.4400000000005
noted notific

6863.92 --> 6868.4400000000005
doesn't mean that it exists

6872.04 --> 6877.119
separately Mass was worked out from

6874.92 --> 6880.4400000000005
density that

6877.119 --> 6880.44
yeah that's

6882.96 --> 6889.679
right that's why you oh really and and

6886.28 --> 6889.679
why did you ask

6890.079 --> 6895.599
that why what's the point why did you

6893.04 --> 6898.719
ask that party fish why is it so

6895.599 --> 6901.52
important to you that you're coming back

6898.719 --> 6906.4
now having all this attitude why why did

6901.52 --> 6906.400000000001
you ask that huh you tell

6910.239 --> 6917.159
me okay that's what you

6914.159 --> 6917.159
think

6917.56 --> 6924.119000000001
yeah yeah cuz density

6921.32 --> 6926.84
exists physically exists you can

6924.119 --> 6930.5599999999995
literally without having any math

6926.84 --> 6934.1990000000005
involved compare the density of one

6930.56 --> 6934.1990000000005
thing with another

6936.719 --> 6939.719
thing

6940.159 --> 6945.96
yeah you can't do that with mass you

6943.679 --> 6952.0
have to

6945.96 --> 6952.0
calculate in order to get that value

6953.199 --> 6961.879999999999
which makes it not

6956.4 --> 6961.879999999999
physical makes it derived that was my

6963.159 --> 6970.159
point oh see you okay bye bye thanks for

6967.639 --> 6970.159000000001
wasting my

6976.04 --> 6982.5199999999995
time yeah I already answered this I

6978.88 --> 6982.52
answered this before

7001.079 --> 7004.079
oh

7036.639 --> 7040.56
yeah thanks for hanging there with me El

7038.52 --> 7042.88
good to have you in the

7040.56 --> 7046.280000000001
chat wonder where every else is gone

7042.88 --> 7046.28
where did the clear go all of a

7056.159 --> 7062.199
sudden right if anybody else is

7058.56 --> 7065.88
interested in asking a

7062.199 --> 7065.879999999999
question maybe they want

7067.639 --> 7074.119
to just tell me about something

7070.36 --> 7074.119
interesting out there

7080.92 --> 7085.76
cats are playing with the groundhogs

7082.76 --> 7085.76
okay

7113.679 --> 7116.679
m

7139.44 --> 7141.879999999999
what is

7161.04 --> 7165.079
this for

7203.32 --> 7206.32
h

7244.35 --> 7247.4490000000005
[Music]

7260.239 --> 7263.718999999999
back and forth with David Weiss

7264.96 --> 7268.96
here want to add him on

7269.56 --> 7276.04
Skype for the coming Friday they should

7272.719 --> 7276.04
have him on

7304.15 --> 7307.33
[Music]

7307.84 --> 7313.88
interesting how so many people find

7310.079 --> 7315.96
their way here the same exact questions

7313.88 --> 7318.52
and don't even really know what they

7315.96 --> 7318.52
want to

7318.639 --> 7321.639
ask

7323.159 --> 7329.239
yeah but I mean a lot of people that are

7326.4 --> 7334.5199999999995
like even looking for answers about Flat

7329.239 --> 7334.5199999999995
Earth they've all like gone through

7334.8 --> 7340.679
these these discussions about it that

7338.079 --> 7344.44
are like based in false

7340.679 --> 7347.32
dichotomy and and so like the guy

7344.44 --> 7349.28
earlier asked like oh is the moon within

7347.32 --> 7350.799999999999
the container right that's a very

7349.28 --> 7354.44
typical

7350.8 --> 7356.360000000001
question right that obviously assumes

7354.44 --> 7357.879999999999
the Moon is a physical object that has

7356.36 --> 7361.5199999999995
an actual

7357.88 --> 7364.119
location which is kind of reinforced by

7361.52 --> 7367.76
the physicality assumption

7364.119 --> 7371.4
bias part of the heliocentric system in

7367.76 --> 7374.1990000000005
which all the planets are and the moons

7371.4 --> 7377.0
are all physical objects at a set

7374.199 --> 7377.0
astronomical

7379.239 --> 7382.4
distance so people come with that kind

7381.48 --> 7384.759999999999
of

7382.4 --> 7388.839999999999
question and

7384.76 --> 7390.56
typical dis Dome flat ears will always

7388.84 --> 7393.32
say like oh no

7390.56 --> 7396.159000000001
it's either they will be more correct

7393.32 --> 7397.759999999999
say it's just the light in the sky or

7396.159 --> 7400.079
they will say like no it's definitely

7397.76 --> 7404.360000000001
like in within the

7400.079 --> 7405.159
Dome because that's how the angles would

7404.36 --> 7408.44
add

7405.159 --> 7411.5199999999995
up to draw a conclusion that it is like

7408.44 --> 7414.678999999999
roughly 3,000 miles

7411.52 --> 7418.280000000001
high like spinning over the

7414.679 --> 7418.28
disc that's what they

7418.96 --> 7423.2390000000005
think based on that

7421.079 --> 7426.36
presupposition this is just a very

7423.239 --> 7429.759999999999
typical question that newcomers will

7426.36 --> 7431.239
bring forth and every time though I

7429.76 --> 7433.320000000001
always have to tell them like yeah

7431.239 --> 7436.5199999999995
there's so many things that are out

7433.32 --> 7439.04
there just taken for granted

7436.52 --> 7442.719
assumed when there is no real evidence

7439.04 --> 7446.4
for it and that kind of tends to confuse

7442.719 --> 7450.36
people it just they thought that they

7446.4 --> 7452.48
could figure it out relay their

7450.36 --> 7455.4
understanding like away from the

7452.48 --> 7457.959999999999
heliocentric conceptions of vastly

7455.4 --> 7459.36
distant bodies towards the discourse

7457.96 --> 7462.4800000000005
model where it's just

7459.36 --> 7466.199
closer but then when I tell them and

7462.48 --> 7469.959999999999
explain like yeah but you don't really

7466.199 --> 7474.719
know like we don't really know we're not

7469.96 --> 7477.079
sure it's doesn't like we don't have as

7474.719 --> 7481.32
much

7477.079 --> 7483.96
tangible reliable information facts

7481.32 --> 7487.96
about how these things exactly are like

7483.96 --> 7490.639
what they actually are as people find

7487.96 --> 7493.199
comfortable because it's very

7490.639 --> 7496.079
uncomfortable realizing that you don't

7493.199 --> 7496.079
really know these

7497.0 --> 7502.76
details and my explanations like about

7500.239 --> 7506.28
the non-local holographic angular

7502.76 --> 7509.1990000000005
manifestations is just an attempt to

7506.28 --> 7509.199
just be more

7510.719 --> 7516.0
honest and step away from physicality

7513.44 --> 7516.0
assumption

7516.04 --> 7522.599
bias but yeah it does leave a big

7519.079 --> 7525.32
mystery a big designer mystery

7522.599 --> 7529.8
that may make some people uncomfortable

7525.32 --> 7532.239
just realizing like what so like nobody

7529.8 --> 7534.8
really understands

7532.239 --> 7536.598999999999
then yeah and that's like a shocking

7534.8 --> 7538.84
realization because a lot of people like

7536.599 --> 7542.52
they need that

7538.84 --> 7544.559
comfort that feeling that there's people

7542.52 --> 7546.679
out there that know like they don't have

7544.559 --> 7550.360000000001
to know but there's people that get it

7546.679 --> 7552.8
right it's like a like Daddy Daddy the

7550.36 --> 7554.48
priest like oh they understand how this

7552.8 --> 7557.1990000000005
all

7554.48 --> 7560.199
works right it's a sort of a level of

7557.199 --> 7562.119
comfort that people just need very

7560.199 --> 7564.32
comparable to when you're a very little

7562.119 --> 7566.96
kid you're going to assume that your

7564.32 --> 7568.599
parents understand everything that's

7566.96 --> 7570.32
just going to be the

7568.599 --> 7573.76
Assumption like that's what you're going

7570.32 --> 7576.119
to naturally Trust on it's only later

7573.76 --> 7578.679
usually during the teens that you find

7576.119 --> 7581.92
out like oh wait no they don't really

7578.679 --> 7584.679
understand things either

7581.92 --> 7586.4
and then if you keep going and going

7584.679 --> 7589.84
wanting to find out more then you

7586.4 --> 7592.159
realize like holy [Â __Â ] there's a whole

7589.84 --> 7594.159000000001
bunch of things that people like that

7592.159 --> 7596.679
nobody really

7594.159 --> 7599.679
understands they just don't and there's

7596.679 --> 7603.28
like people dedicating their entire

7599.679 --> 7606.4
lives to to

7603.28 --> 7609.159
ideas that where there is no certain

7606.4 --> 7612.558999999999
knowledge about it really it's just an

7609.159 --> 7616.159
idea and then you realize like holy [Â __Â ]

7612.559 --> 7619.719
people don't know as much as they think

7616.159 --> 7625.879999999999
they do univer like Humanity as a whole

7619.719 --> 7625.88
doesn't know as much as it thinks it

7629.32 --> 7635.639
does and that's

7632.48 --> 7639.239
uncomfortable in a way that's like

7635.639 --> 7642.4800000000005
getting to that point is like

7639.239 --> 7645.638999999999
intellectually growing up

7642.48 --> 7647.32
and it's tough it's tough in your mind

7645.639 --> 7650.159000000001
to realize

7647.32 --> 7651.4
like the knowledge isn't just out there

7650.159 --> 7654.96
for you to

7651.4 --> 7658.92
find you can only

7654.96 --> 7661.96
approximate insight about things based

7658.92 --> 7664.559
on how you manage to assemble the

7661.96 --> 7664.559
available

7667.199 --> 7672.32
data and there is no knowledge basically

7670.559 --> 7674.96
there is no

7672.32 --> 7677.599
certainty there's only the available

7674.96 --> 7680.199
data and how you think of

7677.599 --> 7682.88
it it's very

7680.199 --> 7685.799999999999
strenuous very uncomfortable for a whole

7682.88 --> 7690.079
bunch of people then they realize like

7685.8 --> 7694.04
oh so it's basically just a opinion game

7690.079 --> 7697.719
and then you realize that group

7694.04 --> 7701.639
dynamics with all its

7697.719 --> 7704.0
volatility is basically ruling is ruling

7701.639 --> 7704.0
over

7704.96 --> 7710.32
everything and yeah if you're a little

7707.52 --> 7713.360000000001
bit spiritual like me then you realize

7710.32 --> 7716.28
like yeah that's Satan that's the ruler

7713.36 --> 7718.839999999999
of this world it's the it's a collective

7716.28 --> 7720.88
Spirit

7718.84 --> 7725.4800000000005
of not

7720.88 --> 7728.36
knowing but wanting to impose your

7725.48 --> 7731.28
view and it's a collective effect people

7728.36 --> 7736.679
side with something and then they carry

7731.28 --> 7740.159
it out they become in service of that

7736.679 --> 7744.639
opinion that doesn't have evidence but

7740.159 --> 7748.799999999999
it has a consensus perhaps it has a body

7744.639 --> 7751.719
of work or people to fall back on to

7748.8 --> 7754.079000000001
give weight to your argument even though

7751.719 --> 7756.599
you don't have absolute

7754.079 --> 7760.0
proof it's like how a lot of religions

7756.599 --> 7762.639
work and that's very uncomfortable it's

7760.0 --> 7767.52
it's just finding out

7762.639 --> 7771.4800000000005
that how the world works and that it is

7767.52 --> 7776.040000000001
ruled by a collective

7771.48 --> 7779.32
spirit that just imposes their

7776.04 --> 7783.44
opinion people took the opinion and then

7779.32 --> 7785.48
imposed that on others and it's like

7783.44 --> 7787.759999999999
politics there's no

7785.48 --> 7790.598999999999
evidence and it's really frustrating

7787.76 --> 7792.320000000001
when you realize like you're going up

7790.599 --> 7795.4400000000005
against a group that's just trying to

7792.32 --> 7797.639
suppress your unique View and ideas

7795.44 --> 7801.32
because they have a different

7797.639 --> 7804.8
view without evidence without having

7801.32 --> 7804.799999999999
logically put it

7808.679 --> 7814.88
together it's

7811.88 --> 7819.1990000000005
tough but I try to do it yeah hello

7814.88 --> 7819.1990000000005
hello Lor good morning to you

7826.639 --> 7831.52
right so yeah I hope everybody

7828.92 --> 7832.32
appreciates the stream I do feel good I

7831.52 --> 7834.84
do

7832.32 --> 7839.119
feel I think I'm doing

7834.84 --> 7839.119000000001
fine yeah the chats died down a

7842.079 --> 7849.48
bit people might have jumped to another

7846.079 --> 7851.639
stream FL Earth debate is going I don't

7849.48 --> 7856.32
know what kind of video they're review

7851.639 --> 7856.32
doing some anti flat earther I

7868.32 --> 7873.239
think but I'm still here

7883.21 --> 7889.04
[Applause]

7886.04 --> 7889.04
h

7914.05 --> 7917.329000000001
[Applause]

7944.92 --> 7950.079
right so yeah don't forget to Rogan it

7946.88 --> 7952.32
up and hope you're all enjoying the

7950.079 --> 7955.558999999999
stream thus far

7952.32 --> 7960.599
still just gone a little over two hours

7955.559 --> 7960.599
and ready to do another hour at

7961.44 --> 7967.719
least

7963.04 --> 7967.719
so thunderstorm just rolling

7968.4 --> 7972.4
oh cool

7973.559 --> 7979.559
yeah there's no thunderstorm here is it

7976.239 --> 7979.558999999999
getting a bit more cloudy

8000.119 --> 8004.079
though for

8060.679 --> 8064.8
all right so yeah thanks issg for for

8063.28 --> 8066.759999999999
being there with me I really do

8064.8 --> 8070.599
appreciate it it would be like another

8066.76 --> 8072.1990000000005
20 minutes it's just very typical I'm

8070.599 --> 8075.559
going to have to get over that

8072.199 --> 8078.759999999999
personally that it it does keep

8075.559 --> 8081.400000000001
happening just like subject rolls out

8078.76 --> 8085.159000000001
I'm going and then at some point people

8081.4 --> 8087.48
just like they just drop off I mean

8085.159 --> 8089.719
maybe you could blame me saying like oh

8087.48 --> 8092.5199999999995
but you're telling them that you might

8089.719 --> 8097.0
ban them if they keep the attitude it's

8092.52 --> 8100.0
like maybe maybe that's the

8097.0 --> 8103.079
reason but I

8100.0 --> 8104.76
mean it does seem kind of unreasonable

8103.079 --> 8105.92
what they're doing and it's especially

8104.76 --> 8108.320000000001
just the

8105.92 --> 8111.559
timing right I'm in the middle of trying

8108.32 --> 8114.36
to explain something and they just like

8111.559 --> 8118.84
oh quickly type it out type it out just

8114.36 --> 8122.36
get in the way like that scares away the

8118.84 --> 8125.92
newcomer yeah your snow Bing it it's

8122.36 --> 8128.558999999999
very annoying so it's not necessarily

8125.92 --> 8132.96
even about the question or the the

8128.559 --> 8132.96
objections it's about how you're doing

8133.159 --> 8142.32
it right and then afterward yeah I can

8137.48 --> 8144.04
address it I I just did just did address

8142.32 --> 8146.88
party fishous

8144.04 --> 8148.5199999999995
objection who thinks he's got something

8146.88 --> 8149.4800000000005
by telling me like oh how do they

8148.52 --> 8152.320000000001
measure

8149.48 --> 8155.5199999999995
density oh it's Mass over

8152.32 --> 8158.119
volume it's like yeah I I never denied

8155.52 --> 8159.92
that that is how it's

8158.119 --> 8162.558999999999
noted

8159.92 --> 8163.639
technically yeah but that doesn't mean

8162.559 --> 8169.2390000000005
that

8163.639 --> 8169.2390000000005
mass is a thing

8172.88 --> 8178.36
physically cuz you can't have

8176.32 --> 8182.92
mass without

8178.36 --> 8182.92
volume like they're tied in

8183.44 --> 8189.598999999999
right you can mathematically derive it

8187.119 --> 8193.679
but that doesn't make it

8189.599 --> 8196.639000000001
a a separated thing within physics

8193.679 --> 8200.83
doesn't work like that right even though

8196.639 --> 8203.679
that is what is required if you wish to

8200.83 --> 8207.399
[Music]

8203.679 --> 8209.399
Define nutonian mechanics within

8207.399 --> 8213.399
physics because it

8209.399 --> 8215.599
is based on Mass being a thing Mass

8213.399 --> 8217.24
attracting Mass not mass over volume

8215.599 --> 8220.399
attracting Mass over volume no Mass

8217.24 --> 8222.96
attracting mass and that simply is like

8220.399 --> 8225.8
an irrational concept because there is

8222.96 --> 8230.839999999998
no Mass without the

8225.8 --> 8230.84
volume there's no volumeless

8232.359 --> 8239.92
Mass right and I thought that bringing

8235.28 --> 8239.92
it up at the time is very distracting

8241.04 --> 8249.240000000002
right when I say Newtonian mechanics is

8245.399 --> 8251.399
debunked uh I'm not I'm not I didn't say

8249.24 --> 8254.08
that so I could have like a half hour

8251.399 --> 8256.358999999999
bickering back and forth with ball

8254.08 --> 8259.399
Believers that tell me they learn it at

8256.359 --> 8261.08
University which I think is a lie like

8259.399 --> 8263.358999999999
they don't do that they don't teach that

8261.08 --> 8265.96
at a university yeah some computer

8263.359 --> 8269.84
program might use

8265.96 --> 8272.039999999999
it right practically because it's a

8269.84 --> 8274.92
basic mechanic

8272.04 --> 8279.080000000002
system and you can use that doesn't mean

8274.92 --> 8279.08
that it's real within physics

8279.359 --> 8285.559000000001
though and I don't want to scare away

8282.24 --> 8287.8
the newcom I just wanted to give simple

8285.559 --> 8289.8
answers if you then have a half hour

8287.8 --> 8292.0
bickering with a baller about it yeah

8289.8 --> 8293.92
they get scared off they get a headache

8292.0 --> 8296.719
they're like I don't want to do this I

8293.92 --> 8300.519
get I'm out of here yeah that's exactly

8296.719 --> 8300.518999999998
what I tried to prevent

8301.84 --> 8308.519
it's a weird question to ask what a

8303.96 --> 8308.518999999998
density unit is I

8309.88 --> 8316.119999999999
know but it's not so strange when you

8312.719 --> 8319.199999999999
realize why they asked it they asked it

8316.12 --> 8321.800000000001
because they wanted to make that claim

8319.2 --> 8325.719000000001
that mass is a

8321.8 --> 8329.0
thing a thing within physics to try to

8325.719 --> 8331.24
legitimate Newtonian mechanics that's

8329.0 --> 8334.0
exclusively

8331.24 --> 8337.76
the reason why they ask that it's the

8334.0 --> 8340.439
only reason people ever ask that you see

8337.76 --> 8343.08
it's always because they want

8340.439 --> 8345.76
to make that claim that Newtonian

8343.08 --> 8348.479
mechanics isn't debunked within

8345.76 --> 8351.28
physics it's always that it's the only

8348.479 --> 8353.679
reason I've ever heard anybody ask the

8351.28 --> 8358.639000000001
question every single time it's always

8353.679 --> 8362.399
because of that it's always being asked

8358.639 --> 8364.039999999999
after the statement is made that mass is

8362.399 --> 8366.279999999999
not a thing within

8364.04 --> 8371.399000000001
physics that's when that question

8366.28 --> 8373.479000000001
arrives every single time no exception

8371.399 --> 8377.479
in the eight years that I've done it

8373.479 --> 8377.479
it's always like that every

8379.28 --> 8384.24
time you

8381.2 --> 8386.2
see it's like you just know when people

8384.24 --> 8389.72
ask certain question in certain moments

8386.2 --> 8392.640000000001
you will know exactly why after you

8389.72 --> 8394.88
experienced it hundreds of times you

8392.64 --> 8396.439
just know exactly why they asked it and

8394.88 --> 8399.08
why

8396.439 --> 8401.12
then it's CU they were not willing to

8399.08 --> 8403.039999999999
accept that Newtonian mechanics is

8401.12 --> 8405.399000000001
officially

8403.04 --> 8407.439
debunked and just because the mechanics

8405.399 --> 8410.64
are still used here in there doesn't

8407.439 --> 8412.52
mean that it's getting scientific

8410.64 --> 8415.76
legitimacy and they just don't want to

8412.52 --> 8417.76
know they don't want to recognize that

8415.76 --> 8421.2
because that just point gives more

8417.76 --> 8424.76
pointers it points out like oh but

8421.2 --> 8427.479000000001
uhoh uhoh the heliocentric model in the

8424.76 --> 8431.84
universe it's still being held together

8427.479 --> 8435.0
by Newtonian mechanics oops oops Yeah

8431.84 --> 8436.359
but it's debunked yeah oh wait you what

8435.0 --> 8440.76
you

8436.359 --> 8444.04
can't redo it without Newtonian

8440.76 --> 8448.800000000001
mechanics oo that's a tough one isn't it

8444.04 --> 8450.92
oo yeah yeah I know I know you can't

8448.8 --> 8452.84
make any progress right without that

8450.92 --> 8455.479
Newtonian mechanics that's officially

8452.84 --> 8458.399
debunked it's tough It's very tough and

8455.479 --> 8460.08
I know that's why you get a headache

8458.399 --> 8461.8
every time somebody reminds you like

8460.08 --> 8463.64
yeah it's it's debunk it's officially

8461.8 --> 8467.279999999999
the buunk is not recognized that as

8463.64 --> 8469.279999999999
legitimate physics anymore right mass is

8467.28 --> 8472.720000000001
not a thing and it doesn't attract other

8469.28 --> 8475.04
mass and because it's not a thing yeah

8472.72 --> 8477.16
something that isn't a thing separately

8475.04 --> 8480.080000000002
yeah density is a thing but mass is not

8477.16 --> 8483.119999999999
a thing and so that mass that isn't a

8480.08 --> 8485.92
thing at the DED concept cannot attract

8483.12 --> 8488.439
another derived concept doesn't work

8485.92 --> 8489.64
it's not legitimate physics and it's

8488.439 --> 8492.359
very

8489.64 --> 8495.64
painful very painful to then realize

8492.359 --> 8499.04
like oh wait that means that the entire

8495.64 --> 8502.16
heliocentric model of the universe is

8499.04 --> 8504.960000000001
held together by debunked

8502.16 --> 8507.52
mechanics it's very tough it's very

8504.96 --> 8510.24
strenuous on on B

8507.52 --> 8512.08
Believers that's why they try to force

8510.24 --> 8515.119999999999
themselves into the conversation they

8512.08 --> 8518.28
say like no it is real it is real what's

8515.12 --> 8519.359
density smash over volume which means

8518.28 --> 8523.12
it's

8519.359 --> 8526.800000000001
real no it isn't makes it a derived

8523.12 --> 8530.08
concept and a derived concept does not

8526.8 --> 8530.08
trct another derived

8530.12 --> 8539.04
concept that's not a naturally occurring

8534.84 --> 8539.04
phenomenon and thereby not

8539.52 --> 8543.479000000001
physics for

8565.82 --> 8568.84
[Music]

8575.64 --> 8578.0
let's

8580.0 --> 8585.72
just just say what it is just Newtonian

8583.2 --> 8585.720000000001
mechanics

8586.96 --> 8592.279999999999
debunked Ballers always rush in to ruin

8596.279 --> 8601.76
things so they displac KN with

8599.319 --> 8604.8
assumption to a Comm it consensus and

8601.76 --> 8604.800000000001
call it knowing

8606.16 --> 8610.479
yeah that's right

8633.2 --> 8637.08
thanks for sticking with me by the way

8635.04 --> 8638.080000000002
LSG for last half hour I really do

8637.08 --> 8642.64
appreciate

8638.08 --> 8642.64
it wish some other people will also

8642.76 --> 8649.479
join but uh is good to have you back as

8647.08 --> 8652.92
a as a reflection board I really

8649.479 --> 8652.92
appreciate it

8668.359 --> 8671.359
is

8715.359 --> 8720.880000000001
took the week off of work really need it

8717.72 --> 8725.358999999999
oh okay cool

8720.88 --> 8729.96
you the W vacation I I'm

8725.359 --> 8729.960000000001
here I'd love to have the company

8730.76 --> 8736.92
online and hey if you want I could even

8733.359 --> 8739.640000000001
like have you call in as a

8736.92 --> 8742.319
guest through Skype I mean today is a

8739.64 --> 8744.68
little late perhaps but there's any

8742.319 --> 8747.039999999999
other day except Friday although it

8744.68 --> 8747.04
could be

8747.16 --> 8752.76
too I'd love to just have you as a as

8750.399 --> 8755.119999999999
speaking guest maybe sometime if you

8752.76 --> 8755.12
feel like

8757.439 --> 8762.08
itg and we could have conversation like

8779.24 --> 8783.279
this for

8837.2 --> 8841.76
H okay this is interesting

8843.52 --> 8848.880000000001
some substance just an article that just

8846.52 --> 8848.880000000001
bumped

8849.24 --> 8855.399
into some substance from easter

8852.6 --> 8858.76
island

8855.399 --> 8862.68
called Rapa

8858.76 --> 8862.68
myy it's

8863.16 --> 8867.88
apparently very good for you

8874.76 --> 8879.04
wait you can actually just buy that

8876.64 --> 8879.039999999999
stuff

8881.33 --> 8884.659
[Music]

8894.0 --> 8898.0
now huh

8905.04 --> 8912.800000000001
keep an eye out for that that looks

8909.2 --> 8917.560000000001
interesting it's also for hair growth

8912.8 --> 8922.679999999998
oh oh no I could I could reverse my bald

8917.56 --> 8926.439
win oh no I'm so balding oh no oh yeah

8922.68 --> 8926.439
no not really

8934.76 --> 8940.04
what okay Gary F what the [Â __Â ] are you

8938.08 --> 8942.24
talking about I have jumped the shark

8940.04 --> 8942.240000000002
what

8943.08 --> 8947.56
shark what's your problem

8962.319 --> 8969.199999999999
are you going to make an argument for

8964.2 --> 8969.2
that statement or you just a troll

8983.319 --> 8988.84
nowal size yeah elg don't worry about it

8986.6 --> 8992.439
I mean if I'd have you on I mean you

8988.84 --> 8995.04
don't have to like talk all the time or

8992.439 --> 8996.960000000001
anything I'll probably do most of the

8995.04 --> 8999.68
talking I mean just look at my interview

8996.96 --> 8999.679999999998
with blue pill

8999.96 --> 9003.88
Evolution like afterward I realized that

9002.96 --> 9007.278999999999
I

9003.88 --> 9009.479
was he had a lot of

9007.279 --> 9012.439
response

9009.479 --> 9015.199999999999
impulses we're going to need a bigger

9012.439 --> 9018.2
boat now you're going to need a bigger

9015.2 --> 9018.2
boat

9021.96 --> 9028.358999999999
oh oh look who it is oh wait nobody can

9025.439 --> 9032.68
see that cuz it's a troll and they're

9028.359 --> 9032.68
banned before anybody can ever see it

9044.96 --> 9050.399
a so Gary Fe you're going to have a

9047.399 --> 9050.399
point

9050.479 --> 9056.76
I jumped a shark apparently according to

9054.399 --> 9056.76
a

9057.04 --> 9061.92
guy who's been here on YouTube less than

9060.2 --> 9063.800000000001
a month and he's not going to tell me

9061.92 --> 9066.319
why

9063.8 --> 9068.438999999998
apparently but I guess I jumped a shark

9066.319 --> 9071.08
I went too far this time I don't know

9068.439 --> 9071.08
with what

9074.2 --> 9080.76
though or maybe it's Newtonian mechanics

9076.96 --> 9083.199999999999
debunk maybe it's just like oh oh no oh

9080.76 --> 9086.24
no my new tonian mechanics based heart

9083.2 --> 9087.880000000001
is is failing you can't do this you

9086.24 --> 9092.399
can't say that's

9087.88 --> 9092.399
debunked really I can't why

9095.359 --> 9100.319
not I'm pretty sure that I can

9136.2 --> 9139.2
wow

9163.88 --> 9169.24
yeah when you when you Google it you

9166.479 --> 9172.119999999999
certainly get a whole bunch of ball

9169.24 --> 9175.119999999999
tarded [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ]

9172.12 --> 9175.12
business

9177.96 --> 9182.839999999998
absolutely but I know why I know why

9181.04 --> 9186.080000000002
they why they're doing this like this

9182.84 --> 9188.92
wasn't there in 2015 huh it's all these

9186.08 --> 9188.92
responses from

9189.0 --> 9195.399
201922 why would that be why why would

9192.88 --> 9198.278999999999
that suddenly be there oh could it be

9195.399 --> 9200.96
because they realized oh [Â __Â ] the entire

9198.279 --> 9203.92
heliocentric conception of

9200.96 --> 9206.438999999998
outer stuck together using neonian

9203.92 --> 9208.0
mechanics so we can't allow people to

9206.439 --> 9210.64
think that it's debunk so we're just

9208.0 --> 9212.8
going to claim like oh no no it works

9210.64 --> 9216.039999999999
it's just some slight alteration it

9212.8 --> 9218.399
really works yeah no it doesn't it was

9216.04 --> 9221.319000000001
debunked last

9218.399 --> 9223.84
century yeah very prominent

9221.319 --> 9226.119999999999
physics people back

9223.84 --> 9228.72
then made those

9226.12 --> 9231.6
statements back then like yeah it is

9228.72 --> 9233.76
debunk it's no scientific legitimacy to

9231.6 --> 9235.92
it I know people don't really know what

9233.76 --> 9238.24
science is anymore they think that

9235.92 --> 9240.84
science can just be decided

9238.24 --> 9242.88
upon right you just make an assumption

9240.84 --> 9245.319
you do a bunch of testing and then if

9242.88 --> 9247.16
you think that the testing proves the

9245.319 --> 9248.84
Assumption you just assume it and then

9247.16 --> 9250.24
it's science yeah no it isn't it's a

9248.84 --> 9254.04
very specific method you have to have

9250.24 --> 9256.039999999999
the naturally occurring phenomenon not

9254.04 --> 9258.279
derived from a man-made device and then

9256.04 --> 9262.240000000002
you have to very

9258.279 --> 9265.68
manipulate the C C of an

9262.24 --> 9267.279
effect of that involves that naturally

9265.68 --> 9270.720000000001
occurring phenomenon in order to

9267.279 --> 9275.92
establish whether it is the cause of the

9270.72 --> 9278.319
effect and that way you can establish

9275.92 --> 9280.399
science can establish the scientific

9278.319 --> 9284.56
cause of the

9280.399 --> 9287.479
effect yeah and I mean that's archaic

9284.56 --> 9289.92
now because oh yeah we got engineering

9287.479 --> 9291.88
and technology and like yeah you don't

9289.92 --> 9293.52
use naturally occurring phenomenon that

9291.88 --> 9295.96
yeah that's why it's called engineering

9293.52 --> 9295.960000000001
and not

9302.279 --> 9306.960000000001
science but uh it's all become so

9313.0 --> 9319.8
convoluted but yeah newtoni mechanics is

9315.88 --> 9322.16
debunked it's definitely debunked

9319.8 --> 9325.759999999998
yeah mass does not attract Mass there's

9322.16 --> 9328.96
no scientific evidence for that nor

9325.76 --> 9332.279
could you because mass is not a thing

9328.96 --> 9335.199999999999
it's a derived concept it can't do

9332.279 --> 9338.720000000001
anything yeah you can calculate

9335.2 --> 9341.479000000001
something with mass but you can't

9338.72 --> 9343.88
physically do something with mass

9341.479 --> 9346.358999999999
because Mass on its own doesn't

9343.88 --> 9350.358999999999
exist only

9346.359 --> 9350.359
density exists

9354.24 --> 9358.76
what are there any naturally occurring

9356.16 --> 9358.76
forms of

9358.92 --> 9361.92
measurement

9362.16 --> 9365.56
what what do you

9378.2 --> 9382.960000000001
mean I'm sure there's naturally

9380.56 --> 9387.359
occurring forms of measurement but it's

9382.96 --> 9389.919999999998
not relevant like science doesn't deal

9387.359 --> 9392.2
with metrics or

9389.92 --> 9393.76
measurement it deals with something

9392.2 --> 9395.560000000001
happening a naturally occurring

9393.76 --> 9397.04
phenomenon that's the part that has to

9395.56 --> 9399.479
be naturally

9397.04 --> 9402.560000000001
occurring that what you do with

9399.479 --> 9407.599999999999
measurement is a side

9402.56 --> 9407.6
note to the scientific experiment

9410.04 --> 9417.800000000001
right you can use man-made

9412.68 --> 9419.76
devices to assist you in testing the

9417.8 --> 9422.039999999999
naturally occurring phenomenon to be the

9419.76 --> 9426.800000000001
cause of the effect as long as the

9422.04 --> 9429.279
naturally occurring phenomenon is not

9426.8 --> 9431.92
created exclusively because of a

9429.279 --> 9433.720000000001
man-made device because then it's not

9431.92 --> 9436.84
naturally occurring

9433.72 --> 9440.76
anymore yeah but you can use technology

9436.84 --> 9443.319
and devices and all that within the

9440.76 --> 9445.0
experiment as long as the phenomenon

9443.319 --> 9447.68
that you're trying to very manipulate to

9445.0 --> 9451.359
establish the cause of the effect is

9447.68 --> 9455.04
natural and not exclusively happening in

9451.359 --> 9455.04
a man-made device

9471.68 --> 9477.0
right so for example something silly

9474.84 --> 9480.56
like gyroscope

9477.0 --> 9483.56
drift is a man-made device and the

9480.56 --> 9487.278999999999
gyroscope is not supposed to drift so

9483.56 --> 9490.0
that would arguably mean it's it's

9487.279 --> 9493.2
malfunctioning or a standard deviation

9490.0 --> 9495.52
with a ring laser gyroscope or whatever

9493.2 --> 9499.04
well that's not a naturally occurring

9495.52 --> 9500.16
phenomenon that's a man-made device that

9499.04 --> 9502.52
does

9500.16 --> 9506.2
something why does it do

9502.52 --> 9508.640000000001
that because a man made the device and

9506.2 --> 9513.08
the device does it because the man made

9508.64 --> 9513.08
it not because it happens

9513.76 --> 9519.359
naturally right you're not going to find

9515.92 --> 9519.359
gyroscope drift in

9522.0 --> 9526.64
nature hey Richard G

9537.6 --> 9541.800000000001
is it correct to say we cannot prove or

9540.359 --> 9543.479000000001
this a contain

9541.8 --> 9546.358999999999
system

9543.479 --> 9549.76
no no that is not

9546.359 --> 9552.319
correct no it's a natural

9549.76 --> 9553.16
antecedent can't have gas pressure

9552.319 --> 9556.278999999999
without

9553.16 --> 9560.16
containment we have gas pressure so

9556.279 --> 9560.16
there has to be containment

9561.359 --> 9566.2
you can prove Earth is a contain

9564.399 --> 9568.96
contained

9566.2 --> 9571.279
system by pointing at the natural

9568.96 --> 9574.16
antecedent for there to be gas pressure

9571.279 --> 9576.800000000001
which is a contained system we have gas

9574.16 --> 9579.399
pressure therefore there is a contained

9576.8 --> 9581.72
system you don't have to measure

9579.399 --> 9584.278999999999
anything just have to establish that

9581.72 --> 9587.479
there is gas pressure therefore there

9584.279 --> 9589.52
could only ever be a contained system

9587.479 --> 9592.358999999999
because you can't have gas pressure

9589.52 --> 9592.359
without

9592.479 --> 9599.399
containment so it's just a natural

9595.8 --> 9602.319
antecedent consequence relationship that

9599.399 --> 9605.8
proves that the earth is

9602.319 --> 9608.6
contained hope that answers your

9605.8 --> 9609.679999999998
question are you messed up no it does

9608.6 --> 9613.76
prove

9609.68 --> 9617.84
it that's proving it yeah it's like

9613.76 --> 9622.68
second law of Thermodynamics natural law

9617.84 --> 9625.16
proves it is contained cuz we have gas

9622.68 --> 9629.16
pressure that's proving

9625.16 --> 9629.16
it pointing at the natural

9634.6 --> 9638.960000000001
law you were thinking it would be a

9637.0 --> 9640.84
fallacy to claim earth is contained

9638.96 --> 9643.839999999998
because of that yeah well that's

9640.84 --> 9643.84
incorrect

9651.439 --> 9657.0
I mean appealing to natural law is

9654.0 --> 9657.0
definitely

9669.24 --> 9673.92
proof right that's why it's natural law

9671.84 --> 9676.84
because everything there's no exception

9673.92 --> 9680.08
and everything proves that the natural

9676.84 --> 9682.64
law is always applicable well if it's

9680.08 --> 9685.08
always applicable

9682.64 --> 9689.24
then if there's gas pressure there has

9685.08 --> 9689.24
to be containment this just what it

9700.359 --> 9705.76
is all right anyway good to see you

9713.2 --> 9719.880000000001
have to take on faith there yeah we yeah

9717.0 --> 9724.64
we can we can demonstrate we are in a

9719.88 --> 9724.64
container we have gas pressure Rich

9726.0 --> 9732.72
G yeah it's natural law antecedent

9729.96 --> 9732.72
consequent

9733.2 --> 9737.84
relationship the demonstration is that

9735.88 --> 9740.759999999998
we have gas

9737.84 --> 9743.439
pressure and it's not immediately

9740.76 --> 9743.439
exploding

9744.72 --> 9752.679999999998
away that is a

9748.279 --> 9752.68
demonstration that proves there is a

9754.479 --> 9760.399
container ready to a I don't know what

9756.96 --> 9760.399
the hell you're talking about Richard

9766.08 --> 9771.52
G I'm sorry did I say that you have have

9769.319 --> 9771.519999999999
to

9776.2 --> 9783.76
apologize I don't know why you're being

9778.16 --> 9786.64
so so feely about this I didn't say

9783.76 --> 9789.319
anything I'm just

9786.64 --> 9792.479
addressing your question here that that

9789.319 --> 9792.479
is all

9813.72 --> 9819.72
just saying that okay fine I don't know

9816.16 --> 9819.72
why though but

9825.92 --> 9831.04
sure more for duper yeah

9844.16 --> 9850.359
yeah

9846.08 --> 9854.359
hey Gary

9850.359 --> 9858.04
Gary how about you take

9854.359 --> 9862.0
30 I see you again

9858.04 --> 9862.0
meddling I'm going to kick you

9866.68 --> 9872.64
out saying to duper I will not cause

9869.52 --> 9872.640000000001
drama with him okay

9874.319 --> 9880.278999999999
cool well and I instructed him never to

9878.08 --> 9881.56
snitch or anything like don't get

9880.279 --> 9885.76
involved with

9881.56 --> 9889.0
that and definitely don't go among

9885.76 --> 9890.92
trolls to try to defend me I am

9889.0 --> 9893.12
instructed him about that and we'll see

9890.92 --> 9893.12
what

9894.24 --> 9899.72
happens if he just follows instruction

9897.439 --> 9902.279
then nothing should everything should

9899.72 --> 9902.278999999999
just settle

9904.76 --> 9909.04
down caught another one

9917.96 --> 9921.96
what for

9963.399 --> 9966.24
right and I don't know what duper is

9964.8 --> 9970.119999999999
going to do I

9966.24 --> 9972.76
mean I don't even yeah I don't really

9970.12 --> 9975.160000000002
understand him anymore

9972.76 --> 9977.72
recently

9975.16 --> 9979.52
so I don't know what what what is up

9977.72 --> 9981.76
with him whether he

9979.52 --> 9983.439
will recognize that maybe he went too

9981.76 --> 9987.04
far or

9983.439 --> 9990.04
anything oh why didn't you stay in come

9987.04 --> 9990.04
on

10027.72 --> 10031.96
come on Richard I could really use the

10029.279 --> 10031.960000000001
company right

10035.68 --> 10041.880000000001
now hey thank Phil good to see you for

10102.2 --> 10110.279
H wow can't believe fed is still live

10106.24 --> 10110.279
they do like a two hour show today I

10125.04 --> 10130.84
guess right anyway hope everybody's

10128.16 --> 10133.479
enjoying the show it's a bit calmed down

10130.84 --> 10136.399
now and think that I did some good

10133.479 --> 10136.399
explanations

10137.2 --> 10142.12
and I am not getting angry because

10139.92 --> 10143.960000000001
nobody's saying anything well mostly

10142.12 --> 10146.2
because El G has been hanging around I

10143.96 --> 10150.16
really do appreciate his presence here

10146.2 --> 10153.76
and and yeah it's been a good person

10150.16 --> 10157.359
to have a conversation

10153.76 --> 10160.0
with and that say some

10157.359 --> 10162.6
genuine things I mean Newtonian

10160.0 --> 10167.12
mechanics being debunked is very serious

10162.6 --> 10167.12
and seems like when you Google

10168.2 --> 10173.04
it seems like I was banned for yeah

10171.239 --> 10175.72
something happened there ffi I don't

10173.04 --> 10178.52
know how don't know who that that did

10175.72 --> 10178.519999999999
that was

10181.8 --> 10185.72
weird but yeah I was checking the list

10184.319 --> 10188.96
and you were in there I don't know who

10185.72 --> 10188.96
did that

10191.96 --> 10199.399
but uh yeah welcome

10196.72 --> 10201.358999999999
back right next time you could just

10199.399 --> 10204.479
contact me on Skype or something and

10201.359 --> 10209.0
just tell me like hey I'm banned and

10204.479 --> 10209.0
then I'll unban you it's up to

10215.0 --> 10220.6
you I mean

10218.92 --> 10221.8
I still have the conversation right

10220.6 --> 10224.76
there it's up to you whether you're

10221.8 --> 10224.759999999998
going to do anything with

10231.52 --> 10238.0
it but yeah some something somebody

10235.16 --> 10243.0
banned you like during the

10238.0 --> 10243.0
uh during the night owl show

10265.49 --> 10268.6
[Music]

10270.359 --> 10275.04
right anyway again hope everybody's

10272.2 --> 10278.04
enjoying the show don't forget to share

10275.04 --> 10278.04
it
