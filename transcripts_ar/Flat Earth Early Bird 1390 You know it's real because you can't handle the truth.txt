oh yeah drop the sizable donation on me

129.479 --> 136.02
yesterday evening

131.84 --> 138.20000000000002
during while it was chat skanking at QE

136.02 --> 138.20000000000002
live

138.239 --> 143.94
so thank you very much brother

142.08 --> 146.78
I had a nice call with him but it was

143.94 --> 146.78
very late though

147.06 --> 151.08
right

148.319 --> 154.01999999999998
so yeah I'm starting pretty much an hour

151.08 --> 156.48000000000002
late sorry about that

154.02 --> 158.64000000000001
but like my schedule just completely

156.48 --> 161.34
went astray

158.64 --> 164.39999999999998
this morning

161.34 --> 165.42000000000002
and yeah I mean just I don't know what

164.4 --> 168.12
it is

165.42 --> 170.819
my roommate just basically just started

168.12 --> 172.739
went into the shower just when I

170.819 --> 174.89999999999998
basically wanted to get ready to go go

172.739 --> 177.78
out for groceries

174.9 --> 179.87900000000002
and he took like

177.78 --> 183.08
more than half an hour and it just

179.879 --> 183.07999999999998
completely wrecked everything

183.3 --> 187.76000000000002
so yeah I'm gonna blame him

189.599 --> 194.39999999999998
anyway I'm here now and can still do an

192.3 --> 195.48000000000002
hour

194.4 --> 198.0
right

195.48 --> 200.94
and in in a way I can't kind of use a

198.0 --> 202.739
break because I mean it's been really

200.94 --> 205.5
intense

202.739 --> 209.70000000000002
being yeah having the Flat Earth debate

205.5 --> 212.4
back and it being so technical again

209.7 --> 214.98
I mean yesterday's after show and even

212.4 --> 218.78
the live show was very similar to like

214.98 --> 218.78
the super long after show we had Monday

218.879 --> 225.07999999999998
and it's great to do that

221.28 --> 225.08
but it also is a bit draining

230.9 --> 236.48000000000002
right anyway hello Tara 306 first in

234.18 --> 236.48000000000002
chat

237.12 --> 243.239
I'll show you whether today

240.9 --> 246.56
it's actually started out really nice

243.239 --> 249.36
and sunny but then it turned into this

246.56 --> 251.48
partially because the trails and I don't

249.36 --> 251.48000000000002
know

254.58 --> 257.0
right

262.759 --> 269.46000000000004
but let's win though so I'm noticing

267.18 --> 271.919
maybe that's the reason guys because

269.46 --> 275.23999999999995
there's not as much wind all the stuff

271.919 --> 275.24
up there isn't blowing away

279.9 --> 282.62
all right

286.27 --> 291.32
[Music]

287.4 --> 291.32
ah camera freeze

304.8 --> 307.34000000000003
ah

316.86 --> 319.58000000000004
right

321.66 --> 325.34000000000003
so how are you doing turret

331.38 --> 335.21999999999997
yeah yesterday's show was really

333.12 --> 338.88
interesting especially because it

335.22 --> 341.58000000000004
started out kind of slow on my side

338.88 --> 344.34
did it though

341.58 --> 345.65999999999997
it didn't feel like it but not really I

344.34 --> 347.75899999999996
guess

345.66 --> 350.28000000000003
like yesterday the start of the show to

347.759 --> 353.16
me felt like the day before

350.28 --> 355.44
when I really did start slow

353.16 --> 359.36
but it wasn't really

355.44 --> 359.36
but then like in the second half

359.58 --> 364.08
like even that sensation just dropped

361.86 --> 366.3
and it was it was quite a blast

364.08 --> 367.62
and everybody in the chat was also just

366.3 --> 369.90000000000003
really

367.62 --> 372.32
saying interesting inspiring things to

369.9 --> 372.32
me so

372.66 --> 378.3
a PGC net

374.759 --> 379.57
going to eat snacks okay you you go and

378.3 --> 382.91
do that

379.57 --> 382.90999999999997
[Music]

384.36 --> 391.059
bon appetit

386.91 --> 391.059
[Music]

391.319 --> 394.699
hello Kuma virus

403.919 --> 409.139
um

406.139 --> 409.139
laughs

411.479 --> 416.34
yeah yesterday was overall very

414.479 --> 419.52
energetic day

416.34 --> 422.34
not just me everybody

419.52 --> 425.639
shows were very interesting QE live was

422.34 --> 427.56
even kind of interesting although they

425.639 --> 429.479
talk a lot about sport they did get on

427.56 --> 431.52
my nerve eventually

429.479 --> 433.62
because it just doesn't interest me as

431.52 --> 436.19899999999996
much

433.62 --> 439.319
I mean I prefer their food talk I mean

436.199 --> 441.539
that way you actually get to see or hear

439.319 --> 444.199
about interesting things so

441.539 --> 444.199
uh

444.599 --> 448.919
but yeah during QE live also Jim Bob

446.94 --> 453.02
went live at the same time so I kind of

448.919 --> 453.02
like was following both shows

454.199 --> 459.5
Jim Bob was having like a pretty

456.36 --> 459.5
rigorous debate

460.08 --> 467.71999999999997
with this time themed uh libertarianism

464.58 --> 472.21999999999997
which is a very complicated subject

467.72 --> 472.22
philosophically that's how they treat it

473.88 --> 478.02
that they had this regular panelists

475.8 --> 480.06
there that comes on regularly

478.02 --> 483.12
look at his name

480.06 --> 486.84
but he was like really into it

483.12 --> 489.78000000000003
he was like almost almost rampussy about

486.84 --> 493.08
it so that was interesting to see to

489.78 --> 494.63899999999995
have like a pretty serious debate

493.08 --> 497.099
on a good level

494.639 --> 498.90000000000003
that's not about Flat Earth

497.099 --> 501.599
so

498.9 --> 503.21999999999997
that was cool check it out made by Jim

501.599 --> 507.139
Bob

503.22 --> 507.139
always an interesting shows

507.259 --> 513.86
especially if you're into philosophy

511.319 --> 513.86
foreign

515.74 --> 522.26
[Music]

518.64 --> 522.26
I think that was pretty much it

530.94 --> 534.6800000000001
Martin Luther live show

535.38 --> 538.1
huh

545.22 --> 552.32
he classified style Indian Hindu temples

548.6 --> 555.12
he's a bit sloppy sometimes

552.32 --> 556.9200000000001
I mean Martin's not exactly like a

555.12 --> 560.04
historian type

556.92 --> 562.26
so that happens more often

560.04 --> 565.62
but uh

562.26 --> 568.14
yeah Martin's doing like weird streams

565.62 --> 569.519
or yeah like flatter day streams but

568.14 --> 571.92
just

569.519 --> 574.1
more often also in the middle of the

571.92 --> 574.0999999999999
week

575.8 --> 581.24
[Music]

578.58 --> 581.24
let's see

581.36 --> 588.5
what's that even from yesterday

584.76 --> 588.5
wasn't that from two days ago

591.18 --> 598.3199999999999
the show called King of the Dome

595.22 --> 599.76
the black Sparta because I did actually

598.32 --> 602.1
sit

599.76 --> 604.38
yeah was in the chat during that show

602.1 --> 606.5600000000001
but that's two days ago that's not

604.38 --> 606.56
yesterday

609.24 --> 612.2
so Monday

619.61 --> 623.429
[Music]

625.2 --> 628.2
foreign

628.38 --> 633.899
is from the UK well he's he's Welsh

631.9 --> 636.48
[Music]

633.899 --> 641.7
so he's

636.48 --> 641.7
Southwest English basically

648.779 --> 653.1
I don't know if you know the difference

650.1 --> 656.16
but uh Terry

653.1 --> 658.14
I mean that is kind of like a they have

656.16 --> 661.98
their own language which is really weird

658.14 --> 665.24
by the way yeah the people in Wales

661.98 --> 667.62
and it's like completely irreconizable

665.24 --> 671.519
compared to English have you ever heard

667.62 --> 673.92
it if like the weirdest street names do

671.519 --> 677.779
almost two days ago yeah yeah okay right

673.92 --> 677.779
yeah I was watching that stream too

678.24 --> 682.27
I didn't watch it all though just

680.94 --> 685.34
a chunk of it

682.27 --> 685.34
[Music]

692.76 --> 695.76
right

702.12 --> 705.12
foreign

708.079 --> 713.8199999999999
clutch yeah I know

711.54 --> 715.38
I mean I'm not always in the mood for

713.82 --> 717.9590000000001
like

715.38 --> 721.079
the really nitty-gritty detail

717.959 --> 723.899
philosophy debating which he does do

721.079 --> 726.8389999999999
and I I'm not always interested in that

723.899 --> 729.32
but a lot of the times it is just very

726.839 --> 729.32
interesting

731.88 --> 741.0
and it's also funny like how when Jim

735.66 --> 743.04
Bob like challenges people that's taken

741.0 --> 745.2
like that's pretty serious to those

743.04 --> 750.019
people and it's very rare that people

745.2 --> 750.019
just ignore Jim Bob when he does that

751.56 --> 757.26
so that's kind of funny

753.68 --> 758.64
so he yeah he seeks out people out there

757.26 --> 760.86
and then just

758.64 --> 763.3199999999999
either makes fun of them or

760.86 --> 765.42
or usually that

763.32 --> 767.8900000000001
but for good reason

765.42 --> 771.049
and it works it keeps working

767.89 --> 771.049
[Music]

778.2 --> 781.5790000000001
get the [ __ ] out here

782.519 --> 788.66
are you serious

785.42 --> 791.5999999999999
seriously no

788.66 --> 794.9399999999999
clueless and sad

791.6 --> 798.0600000000001
oh really based on water

794.94 --> 802.82
Dr Fubar I think you're you you just

798.06 --> 802.8199999999999
squirted your Envy all over yourself

803.04 --> 808.579
it's true dude what the [ __ ] are you

805.079 --> 808.579
talking about you weirdo

809.94 --> 815.7
gym world is one of the sharpest most

812.639 --> 819.139
informed guys I've ever met

815.7 --> 819.139
in video calls

825.0 --> 829.399
two

825.959 --> 829.399
what do you mean Sue

832.65 --> 838.079
[Music]

834.24 --> 842.1
how how are you gonna sue him

838.079 --> 846.1999999999999
all he does is just highlight the things

842.1 --> 846.2
that people say on their own channel

846.839 --> 850.86
what are you gonna do

848.459 --> 852.5999999999999
isn't that just like honest reviewing

850.86 --> 855.2
there's nothing you could legally do

852.6 --> 855.2
about that

856.2 --> 858.26
yeah

859.019 --> 869.66
she oh not easy to see

862.76 --> 869.66
okay oh explain it to us oh wise one

870.42 --> 877.3199999999999
explain it to us then

873.72 --> 879.5400000000001
how Jim Bob is so clueless and sad

877.32 --> 882.2600000000001
explain it then

879.54 --> 882.26
numpty

883.5 --> 888.42
gonna make the statement

885.779 --> 890.76
and then you're expected to back it I

888.42 --> 892.9799999999999
mean the alternative is that I just

890.76 --> 894.48
immediately kick you out because you're

892.98 --> 897.0600000000001
a [ __ ]

894.48 --> 898.74
because only [ __ ] would say things

897.06 --> 901.6199999999999
like that

898.74 --> 903.6
or you could actually try to make an

901.62 --> 907.079
argument out of it

903.6 --> 909.4200000000001
and who knows maybe I'd not immediately

907.079 --> 912.42
kick you after that for being a complete

909.42 --> 914.9399999999999
[ __ ] numpty how about that I'm giving

912.42 --> 917.18
you a chance to actually back what you

914.94 --> 917.1800000000001
said

917.279 --> 923.899
basis is worldview on the supernatural

921.0 --> 923.899
in what context

925.56 --> 928.699
in one context

931.92 --> 935.9399999999999
like what does that mean the word

934.38 --> 939.12
Supernatural

935.94 --> 941.7600000000001
like touches upon three totally

939.12 --> 944.279
different and very much conflicting

941.76 --> 946.92
field so just you're using the word

944.279 --> 950.399
Supernatural in a statement like that is

946.92 --> 953.7199999999999
not clarifying at all

950.399 --> 953.72
so get to the point now

955.62 --> 960.839
unless you don't even have the

958.079 --> 964.4399999999999
background knowledge to distinguish

960.839 --> 967.139
between those three different ways and

964.44 --> 969.1800000000001
realize how vague your statement is

967.139 --> 972.12
maybe you just don't have the faculties

969.18 --> 975.9799999999999
for that Dr Fubar how about that

972.12 --> 975.98
so I'm giving you another chance

977.88 --> 984.54
not detect detected by science

981.779 --> 986.88
yeah but that's wrong that's wrong

984.54 --> 989.279
probably not a lie because it is

986.88 --> 991.4399999999999
confusing right

989.279 --> 995.1
because science

991.44 --> 998.639
deals in the natural world

995.1 --> 1002.779
yeah yeah but the thing is is that

998.639 --> 1007.0
information however can be manipulated

1002.779 --> 1007.0
and the information is Supernatural

1007.399 --> 1012.86
yeah but the knowing which path

1010.579 --> 1015.079
is literally

1012.86 --> 1017.3000000000001
knowledge it's information it's a

1015.079 --> 1021.3389999999999
conscious being in the know and it has

1017.3 --> 1024.74
resulted in a palpable visible effect

1021.339 --> 1026.959
somehow and that's part of a scientific

1024.74 --> 1030.38
experiment calling the called The

1026.959 --> 1034.819
Knowing which path experiment so the

1030.38 --> 1036.199
Supernatural is a actually a part of

1034.819 --> 1039.799
science

1036.199 --> 1042.799
so information is not true yes it is

1039.799 --> 1045.799
information is classified as

1042.799 --> 1048.199
Supernatural within the scientific

1045.799 --> 1050.54
context

1048.199 --> 1054.28
I'm not making any of this up this is

1050.54 --> 1056.32
all 100 correct and based on

1054.28 --> 1059.84
rigorous

1056.32 --> 1061.82
detailed refinement

1059.84 --> 1065.059
how these things work and my experience

1061.82 --> 1067.7
of being like six years

1065.059 --> 1070.94
on the scene and with flat Earth debates

1067.7 --> 1073.179
and with QE sitting through all his

1070.94 --> 1073.179
stuff

1073.88 --> 1077.2600000000002
I know what I'm talking about

1077.66 --> 1081.88
and

1079.16 --> 1084.3200000000002
well if I get some help

1081.88 --> 1086.24
people that really know a lot of of

1084.32 --> 1089.0
these physics books out there and what

1086.24 --> 1091.34
to look for they'd probably be able to

1089.0 --> 1092.84
find citations for me

1091.34 --> 1096.1
I don't

1092.84 --> 1096.1
but I know I'm right

1096.799 --> 1099.679
yeah

1097.82 --> 1102.2
information

1099.679 --> 1105.2
but in physics it's considered

1102.2 --> 1105.2
Supernatural

1106.46 --> 1112.52
it's not tangible but it is definitely

1110.72 --> 1115.94
there

1112.52 --> 1117.86
to the degree that it can actually have

1115.94 --> 1120.52
a direct

1117.86 --> 1120.52
effect

1120.74 --> 1126.44
whether it is like the whether it is

1123.5 --> 1128.539
there or not the knowing the

1126.44 --> 1132.74
Supernatural and it has a direct effect

1128.539 --> 1132.74
on physical manifestations

1133.76 --> 1138.76
so the supernatural not physical

1136.58 --> 1142.84
Supernatural

1138.76 --> 1142.84
is part of science

1143.059 --> 1148.039
but in this context only in this very

1145.7 --> 1150.38
specific way but there is there is an

1148.039 --> 1153.32
officially recognized and revered

1150.38 --> 1156.0200000000002
experiment in quantum mechanics called

1153.32 --> 1159.86
The Knowing witch path which literally

1156.02 --> 1162.5
varies and manipulates the supernatural

1159.86 --> 1165.32
knowing

1162.5 --> 1167.6
in order to establish the effect so

1165.32 --> 1170.48
there's nothing you can do about it you

1167.6 --> 1173.9599999999998
can twist and protest it they know that

1170.48 --> 1175.82
makes no sense my intuition says it

1173.96 --> 1178.78
shouldn't be like that yeah well too

1175.82 --> 1183.02
[ __ ] bad for you because it is

1178.78 --> 1184.28
officially get over it

1183.02 --> 1186.44
foreign

1184.28 --> 1188.84
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

1186.44 --> 1189.98
talking about you numpty [ __ ] no

1188.84 --> 1192.4399999999998
wonder

1189.98 --> 1194.66
you don't like Jim Bob because you're a

1192.44 --> 1196.94
numpty [ __ ] and now you're getting

1194.66 --> 1197.96
the [ __ ] out of my chat you goddamn

1196.94 --> 1201.679
[ __ ]

1197.96 --> 1204.2
I just wasted quality explanation on a

1201.679 --> 1206.98
[ __ ] little [ __ ] like you get the

1204.2 --> 1206.98
[ __ ] out

1211.6 --> 1214.6599999999999
thank you

1215.559 --> 1221.48
parapsychologist or said I wouldn't go

1217.94 --> 1223.76
there PJ CNET I mean seriously don't get

1221.48 --> 1226.64
ideas in your head just because there is

1223.76 --> 1228.679
a supernatural based scientific

1226.64 --> 1231.2
experiment doesn't mean that suddenly

1228.679 --> 1233.66
you could drag everything into science

1231.2 --> 1236.8400000000001
you can't

1233.66 --> 1239.74
but this far we have come

1236.84 --> 1242.1789999999999
right scientifically recognized

1239.74 --> 1245.299
Supernatural things

1242.179 --> 1247.4
it's fascinating look I didn't even know

1245.299 --> 1250.76
this was a thing

1247.4 --> 1253.76
up until like two years ago

1250.76 --> 1256.46
because I thought like Dr Fubar the

1253.76 --> 1259.52
numpty [ __ ] that I just kicked out of

1256.46 --> 1262.4
my chat I thought like that too but it

1259.52 --> 1263.72
didn't start acting like a [ __ ] like

1262.4 --> 1266.96
he just did

1263.72 --> 1270.08
I was just like what but that makes no

1266.96 --> 1273.38
sense to me I don't know why

1270.08 --> 1278.059
but yeah I've thought about it

1273.38 --> 1280.2800000000002
a lot as in regularly as in every time

1278.059 --> 1283.3999999999999
the words knowing which path are

1280.28 --> 1286.22
mentioned in any conversation Ever every

1283.4 --> 1289.1200000000001
single time that happened it made me

1286.22 --> 1292.28
think about this

1289.12 --> 1294.7399999999998
and over the years I've yeah come to the

1292.28 --> 1296.1789999999999
conclusion I guess I was wrong

1294.74 --> 1300.38
originally

1296.179 --> 1302.419
the Supernatural is scientific through

1300.38 --> 1304.159
the knowing witch path experiment it's

1302.419 --> 1306.5590000000002
very confusing

1304.159 --> 1309.14
but it's freaking true and there's

1306.559 --> 1311.86
nothing anybody can do about it except

1309.14 --> 1311.8600000000001
ignore it

1312.02 --> 1317.3799999999999
yeah you know it's real because you

1314.419 --> 1317.38
can't handle the truth

1317.9 --> 1322.76
right and this is not about even

1320.299 --> 1324.559
existing by the way PGC net it's not

1322.76 --> 1326.72
about whether the supernatural exists

1324.559 --> 1329.12
it's about whether it's scientific or

1326.72 --> 1331.039
not whether it can be officially

1329.12 --> 1333.26
recognized through the scientific method

1331.039 --> 1334.58
that's what it's about

1333.26 --> 1337.52
thank you

1334.58 --> 1339.74
right and that's much more complicated

1337.52 --> 1342.3799999999999
than the colloquial scientific method

1339.74 --> 1344.6
which is just all analyze draw

1342.38 --> 1347.8400000000001
conclusion see if it works out right

1344.6 --> 1349.4599999999998
it's way more rigorous and strict than

1347.84 --> 1352.6999999999998
that

1349.46 --> 1354.799
but despite all the the hardships the

1352.7 --> 1358.3400000000001
toughness the strictness of the

1354.799 --> 1361.9
scientific method it still worked the

1358.34 --> 1363.86
supernatural he is officially proven

1361.9 --> 1367.22
scientifically

1363.86 --> 1369.26
and that doesn't mean the supernatural

1367.22 --> 1371.059
all the ghosts are now scientific no

1369.26 --> 1374.539
that's not what that means at all it

1371.059 --> 1379.1
means that information which is

1374.539 --> 1382.7
classified as a supernatural substance

1379.1 --> 1384.559
right it's like yep light

1382.7 --> 1387.74
yeah

1384.559 --> 1391.58
gas you have electricity you have

1387.74 --> 1393.5
uh solids and liquids and you have

1391.58 --> 1396.02
information

1393.5 --> 1398.96
it's really in that type of category

1396.02 --> 1401.72
like it's its own entire thing it's all

1398.96 --> 1403.159
enveloping but it is very separate

1401.72 --> 1406.76
and

1403.159 --> 1409.7
well with the lack of any other ability

1406.76 --> 1414.52
to basically give it a name

1409.7 --> 1414.52
it's yeah I call it a substance

1415.46 --> 1419.8400000000001
information is a substance and it's a

1417.98 --> 1423.32
supernatural substance it's only

1419.84 --> 1426.6399999999999
recognizable by the consciousness

1423.32 --> 1426.6399999999999
and God arguably

1431.72 --> 1435.919
anyway

1432.77 --> 1438.7
[Music]

1435.919 --> 1438.7
ah

1438.74 --> 1442.64
I really thought this guy was actually

1440.96 --> 1445.58
going to be able to hang around I mean

1442.64 --> 1447.44
he was in my chat yesterday

1445.58 --> 1450.3799999999999
and I thought already this is an empty

1447.44 --> 1452.9
dip [ __ ] but then we just had pretty

1450.38 --> 1454.5800000000002
cool conversations and stuck around and

1452.9 --> 1457.88
now today

1454.58 --> 1459.6789999999999
first thing he does [ __ ] over jimbob

1457.88 --> 1463.0390000000002
like seriously

1459.679 --> 1464.539
literally his work first word was

1463.039 --> 1467.0
seriously

1464.539 --> 1468.86
what the [ __ ] man what the hell's wrong

1467.0 --> 1471.52
with this

1468.86 --> 1471.52
people

1479.0 --> 1484.039
no it's not as in opposed to

1481.1 --> 1487.78
Supernatural Thor Casey

1484.039 --> 1487.78
yeah that's a false dichotomy

1488.659 --> 1494.8400000000001
natural means is that it has to be able

1491.659 --> 1497.48
to occur in nature

1494.84 --> 1501.26
and not as a result

1497.48 --> 1503.299
of a man building something

1501.26 --> 1505.94
and it's purely about the phenomenon

1503.299 --> 1507.98
right the phenomenon itself

1505.94 --> 1510.3200000000002
I mean once the phenomenon has been

1507.98 --> 1513.2
found in nature yeah you can definitely

1510.32 --> 1515.12
you use man-made devices

1513.2 --> 1518.0
to do the experiment

1515.12 --> 1519.32
as long as the phenomenon you're doing

1518.0 --> 1522.32
it with

1519.32 --> 1525.02
is establishable in nature

1522.32 --> 1526.82
and not only through the tinkering of a

1525.02 --> 1529.4
man-made device

1526.82 --> 1532.52
see

1529.4 --> 1537.22
but it's not natural it's not opposed to

1532.52 --> 1537.22
Supernatural that's that's incorrect

1537.26 --> 1546.709
that's a myth

1539.1 --> 1546.7089999999998
[Music]

1549.02 --> 1554.02
wrong to say information is above nature

1559.82 --> 1566.02
but it's different from Supernatural as

1563.179 --> 1566.02
in but what

1567.22 --> 1573.5
now Supernatural is look

1570.74 --> 1576.52
this is all naming all of this is about

1573.5 --> 1578.659
naming the words we use it's complicated

1576.52 --> 1583.22
and it's there's not a lot of

1578.659 --> 1586.72
maneuvering room because of the rigidity

1583.22 --> 1586.72
there's nothing you can do about it

1587.72 --> 1593.9
natural is everything that is tangible

1591.74 --> 1596.24
right uh

1593.9 --> 1599.72
QE has like this

1596.24 --> 1602.659
list of things that he says I don't even

1599.72 --> 1605.6000000000001
know them all by heart

1602.659 --> 1609.44
all these elements that how you know it

1605.6 --> 1612.62
is like physical and natural

1609.44 --> 1617.74
but yeah Supernatural

1612.62 --> 1617.7399999999998
doesn't have any physical traits you see

1620.059 --> 1626.539
but it does occur in nature

1623.96 --> 1628.82
I mean

1626.539 --> 1632.539
it doesn't require

1628.82 --> 1634.8799999999999
foreign setup

1632.539 --> 1637.1589999999999
a prepared mind even to do it I think

1634.88 --> 1639.7
you could probably have some weird yeah

1637.159 --> 1639.7
I don't know

1640.0 --> 1646.58
[Music]

1642.98 --> 1649.7
this is how I classify it Supernatural

1646.58 --> 1653.1789999999999
information field knowing

1649.7 --> 1655.82
it can be very manipulated so and it is

1653.179 --> 1658.52
officially recognized right even if they

1655.82 --> 1663.74
just don't recognize the knowing which

1658.52 --> 1665.179
path as Supernatural and non-physical

1663.74 --> 1667.64
well

1665.179 --> 1669.679
it doesn't matter if it is not

1667.64 --> 1672.8600000000001
officially recognized like that because

1669.679 --> 1675.5
that is what it is that is in the actual

1672.86 --> 1678.6399999999999
experiment and the experiment is

1675.5 --> 1678.64
officially recognized

1685.64 --> 1689.0200000000002
so yeah what are you gonna do

1698.29 --> 1702.03
[Music]

1699.74 --> 1707.29
thank you

1702.03 --> 1707.29
[Music]

1709.52 --> 1713.4189999999999
and once that can start collecting

1711.44 --> 1716.26
distribute information are working in

1713.419 --> 1716.26
the Supernatural

1717.279 --> 1722.36
yeah but you could say that but that's

1720.26 --> 1725.6589999999999
basically when you use Supernatural like

1722.36 --> 1729.4399999999998
that that's a physics-based expression

1725.659 --> 1732.2
that's going to be very confusing to the

1729.44 --> 1735.3200000000002
colloquial mindset of people which are

1732.2 --> 1738.14
of course not going to see Supernatural

1735.32 --> 1740.799
being as the physics straight if you

1738.14 --> 1740.7990000000002
know what I mean

1743.48 --> 1746.08
oh

1751.94 --> 1755.38
hello Godzilla by the way

1769.22 --> 1775.159
the Supernatural is what can be

1771.86 --> 1778.12
explained by science

1775.159 --> 1778.1200000000001
okay

1780.5 --> 1783.279
no

1783.74 --> 1788.179
no

1784.539 --> 1791.419
that's fundamentally wrong

1788.179 --> 1794.299
that's the call you're using the word

1791.419 --> 1795.74
science there again in a colloquial

1794.299 --> 1799.6399999999999
sense

1795.74 --> 1802.039
there is plenty that science cannot

1799.64 --> 1804.7990000000002
prove that doesn't mean that it

1802.039 --> 1807.32
automatically becomes Supernatural

1804.799 --> 1809.6589999999999
that's a really ridiculous thing and it

1807.32 --> 1811.52
might have been what's happening in the

1809.659 --> 1813.919
colloquial science Community that's

1811.52 --> 1816.26
probably what they're thinking it's all

1813.919 --> 1818.659
Fantastical crap

1816.26 --> 1821.72
nonsense

1818.659 --> 1824.179
science doesn't prove everything it just

1821.72 --> 1827.96
proves the cause of a naturally

1824.179 --> 1831.039
occurring phenomenon-based effect

1827.96 --> 1831.039
that's what it does

1834.08 --> 1840.799
and just because something is happening

1837.74 --> 1843.86
that you can't figure out what causes it

1840.799 --> 1847.039
like for example the celestial what

1843.86 --> 1850.34
causes the celestials we don't know does

1847.039 --> 1851.779
that mean it is Supernatural or does it

1850.34 --> 1855.559
simply mean

1851.779 --> 1856.94
yeah we can't figure it out

1855.559 --> 1859.6399999999999
yet

1856.94 --> 1863.1200000000001
right I mean that's what that means that

1859.64 --> 1865.64
doesn't mean oh oh my God we can't we

1863.12 --> 1867.32
can't get a scientific method we can't

1865.64 --> 1870.74
use the scientific method to figure this

1867.32 --> 1871.82
out oh that means it's supernatural uh I

1870.74 --> 1874.58
don't know maybe there's some like

1871.82 --> 1876.4399999999998
spiritists in the old days and

1874.58 --> 1877.1589999999999
Alchemists that would think like that I

1876.44 --> 1879.8600000000001
don't

1877.159 --> 1881.6000000000001
it just means oh yeah you just you're

1879.86 --> 1883.76
not figuring out the cause of the effect

1881.6 --> 1885.6789999999999
that's all that doesn't make it

1883.76 --> 1889.039
Supernatural

1885.679 --> 1891.38
because Supernatural

1889.039 --> 1893.24
again are you talking spooky ghost

1891.38 --> 1894.679
Supernatural you just don't get it

1893.24 --> 1898.0
Supernatural

1894.679 --> 1898.0
or are you talking

1898.36 --> 1902.539
non-physical

1900.14 --> 1904.3400000000001
as in entirely which also by the way

1902.539 --> 1906.74
excludes light

1904.34 --> 1910.279
and since well

1906.74 --> 1913.279
light does fall under physical

1910.279 --> 1916.34
it's kind of hard to say oh well the

1913.279 --> 1918.919
celestial lights are Supernatural

1916.34 --> 1919.8799999999999
because we can't figure out what they

1918.919 --> 1922.46
are

1919.88 --> 1926.0800000000002
but they're light though so they are

1922.46 --> 1926.08
physical in that sense

1927.679 --> 1932.96
all right anyway being a bit nitpicky

1930.679 --> 1936.76
now about it

1932.96 --> 1936.76
this is still confusing

1938.12 --> 1942.1589999999999
people are confused about it out there

1946.7 --> 1953.0800000000002
right and just like

1949.64 --> 1953.0800000000002
television and

1953.179 --> 1959.539
popular figures in media try to play

1957.02 --> 1962.299
into this misunderstanding based mindset

1959.539 --> 1965.5
into the colloquial thinking that leads

1962.299 --> 1968.48
to absolutely nothing

1965.5 --> 1970.96
it will absolutely not make you the

1968.48 --> 1970.96
wiser

1973.279 --> 1977.38
hello by the way if letter Sage good to

1975.2 --> 1977.38
see you

1983.6 --> 1986.559
foreign

1986.56 --> 1989.79
[Music]

1996.73 --> 1999.94
[Music]

2001.6 --> 2006.9599999999998
well at least today I'm just diving

2004.059 --> 2006.96
straight into it

2007.059 --> 2012.46
it's a short show but there's no longer

2009.7 --> 2015.779
waiting and all that

2012.46 --> 2015.779
got right into it

2018.1 --> 2022.1789999999999
and science proof a great piece of wood

2020.98 --> 2024.519
now

2022.179 --> 2027.519
it can

2024.519 --> 2030.24
that those are not naturally occurring

2027.519 --> 2030.24
phenomenon

2032.919 --> 2038.46
those are convention-based attributions

2035.559 --> 2038.46
and metrics

2042.539 --> 2049.74
right those fall under what is

2046.72 --> 2054.899
and science doesn't prove what is

2049.74 --> 2054.899
science proves the cause of an effect

2064.78 --> 2070.48
what kind of question is that yeah the

2068.679 --> 2075.3
Omega wordy asked whether what is

2070.48 --> 2075.3
question and science cannot prove that

2097.119 --> 2103.02
yeah it does doesn't it

2099.7 --> 2103.02
I don't know what it is

2104.32 --> 2109.6600000000003
but I mean there must be a whole bunch

2106.96 --> 2113.02
of people out there and then when they

2109.66 --> 2115.42
hear me say my thing the way I do and

2113.02 --> 2119.32
give really solid

2115.42 --> 2120.599
refined explanations to back it all in

2119.32 --> 2124.839
like this

2120.599 --> 2127.7200000000003
monolith of cohesion and consistency

2124.839 --> 2130.7799999999997
can be very frustrating then when you

2127.72 --> 2133.7799999999997
face that and then realize holy [ __ ]

2130.78 --> 2136.78
I've learned it wrong all this time

2133.78 --> 2139.5600000000004
why was that even possible why are we

2136.78 --> 2139.5600000000004
learning it wrong

2139.96 --> 2145.5
like or even like why are we even

2142.66 --> 2145.5
learning this

2149.14 --> 2151.74
you know

2158.8 --> 2163.02
right but anyway when you're talking

2160.72 --> 2163.02
about

2163.06 --> 2166.96
science

2164.44 --> 2170.02
and the supernatural

2166.96 --> 2175.18
it's extremely important to be extremely

2170.02 --> 2177.099
specific about the context

2175.18 --> 2180.3999999999996
when you're talking about science are we

2177.099 --> 2182.44
talking about physics actual science the

2180.4 --> 2185.28
scientific method

2182.44 --> 2189.04
which has a very specific

2185.28 --> 2190.119
definitions of things with reasoned

2189.04 --> 2193.48
backing

2190.119 --> 2197.26
or are you talking colloquial

2193.48 --> 2200.079
right colloquial science and then you

2197.26 --> 2201.94
have the supernatural there

2200.079 --> 2204.3590000000004
which has a completely different meaning

2201.94 --> 2208.839
it's just all the things that are very

2204.359 --> 2212.38
mysterious and people get curious about

2208.839 --> 2214.42
it weird unexplained things that's what

2212.38 --> 2218.6800000000003
they call Supernatural it has nothing to

2214.42 --> 2221.079
do with the physics-based terminology of

2218.68 --> 2224.14
Supernatural

2221.079 --> 2225.4
yeah just like colloquial science is

2224.14 --> 2228.2799999999997
just

2225.4 --> 2230.98
knowledge it's just learning stuff and

2228.28 --> 2232.7200000000003
then calling it science

2230.98 --> 2236.38
is where that is

2232.72 --> 2239.98
just learning stuff yay we're popular

2236.38 --> 2242.32
and cool and so smart learning stuff

2239.98 --> 2245.68
they call it science it isn't science

2242.32 --> 2247.3590000000004
but that's what they've called it

2245.68 --> 2249.94
thereby

2247.359 --> 2252.52
snowing under and undermining the actual

2249.94 --> 2256.06
origin the scientific method and it's

2252.52 --> 2258.96
very strict and specific

2256.06 --> 2258.96
influence

2269.02 --> 2274.44
oh

2271.839 --> 2274.44
all right

2299.619 --> 2303.099
no

2300.88 --> 2304.9
the Omega warranty are you just looking

2303.099 --> 2308.099
to get banned or something why are you

2304.9 --> 2308.099
asking me stupid questions

2329.2 --> 2332.2
foreign

2334.06 --> 2338.5
joke

2335.76 --> 2341.579
right but I'm in the middle of like

2338.5 --> 2341.579
really serious

2341.98 --> 2344.98
defining

2345.78 --> 2352.599
defining terms and

2348.76 --> 2356.32
explaining complicated details that are

2352.599 --> 2358.9
very impactful on the world and then to

2356.32 --> 2362.44
just make a weird statement like that

2358.9 --> 2364.9
seems to undermine the seriousness of

2362.44 --> 2367.18
the subject

2364.9 --> 2369.42
you can call that a joke

2367.18 --> 2373.0789999999997
I call that

2369.42 --> 2373.079
ill-timed disruption

2375.54 --> 2379.92
God damn it somebody's drilling

2380.04 --> 2384.7799999999997
that's not slightly annoying at all

2387.94 --> 2393.119
oh goody I can see that the mic is

2390.4 --> 2393.119
picking it up

2398.11 --> 2409.6800000000003

foreign

2415.33 --> 2422.699

2427.72 --> 2430.359
anyway

2428.95 --> 2434.16
[Music]

2430.359 --> 2434.16
that's good to go through that for a bit

2435.22 --> 2440.3199999999997
but yeah what a situation it is right I

2438.88 --> 2443.56
mean we've talked about it through the

2440.32 --> 2445.839
letter of debate for so long

2443.56 --> 2449.56
science scientific method Natural

2445.839 --> 2451.7799999999997
Sciences versus colloquial science also

2449.56 --> 2454.119
known as pseudoscience although yeah

2451.78 --> 2457.1800000000003
pseudoscience is really a designation

2454.119 --> 2461.1600000000003
meant for colloquial science that is

2457.18 --> 2461.16
declared to be scientific

2461.68 --> 2464.859
it's like an experiment that isn't

2463.54 --> 2466.839
actually

2464.859 --> 2469.839
following the scientific method yet

2466.839 --> 2473.46
claimed to be signed so yeah

2469.839 --> 2473.46
it's all confusing

2474.4 --> 2481.359
I don't know why anybody in the

2477.7 --> 2484.66
scientific Community ever ever green

2481.359 --> 2487.119
lighted the idea of colloquial science

2484.66 --> 2488.3799999999997
and popularizing it I mean it's a

2487.119 --> 2493.6800000000003
disaster

2488.38 --> 2493.6800000000003
it's been an intellectual disaster

2494.5 --> 2499.66
people that have originally greenlighted

2496.78 --> 2501.6400000000003
that okay okay that must be really sorry

2499.66 --> 2505.359
now

2501.64 --> 2509.339
how everything turned completely to [ __ ]

2505.359 --> 2509.339
partially thanks to those decisions

2520.48 --> 2524.619
right they should have stayed very

2523.359 --> 2529.02
strict

2524.619 --> 2529.02
on the language and information

2529.96 --> 2533.079
used to be really good at that in

2532.06 --> 2537.18
England

2533.079 --> 2537.1800000000003
especially pre-20th century

2539.079 --> 2546.1600000000003
you know because they knew

2541.66 --> 2548.7
proper use of language is survival and

2546.16 --> 2548.7
cohesion

2553.599 --> 2557.82
okay I'm just gonna kick you out

2571.48 --> 2577.09
thank you

2579.04 --> 2586.2599999999998

you can go to [ __ ] not

2587.44 --> 2591.819
go and act like a bunch of drunk [ __ ]

2589.839 --> 2594.54
somewhere else thank you very much this

2591.819 --> 2594.54
is a workshop

foreign

2604.61 --> 2607.809
[Music]

2624.94 --> 2628.56
that was the original idea

2629.08 --> 2635.38
[Music]

2631.48 --> 2638.38
right the chat is not just a place where

2635.38 --> 2640.54
you can just blabber

2638.38 --> 2643.1800000000003
it's not just for sharing your opinion

2640.54 --> 2647.02
this is like a think tank

2643.18 --> 2649.2999999999997
Workshop I mean it's not

2647.02 --> 2652.96
secret and we're all locked in we're all

2649.3 --> 2655.96
bound by uh by contracted to like figure

2652.96 --> 2660.18
out something like a real Think Tank

2655.96 --> 2660.18
but we're close to that

2662.68 --> 2669.339
I call it a workshop that's by the way

2665.44 --> 2672.94
typically what happens at workshops

2669.339 --> 2674.74
uh I don't mean like yeah

2672.94 --> 2676.06
I don't even know if in other countries

2674.74 --> 2677.7999999999997
they call that workshops in the

2676.06 --> 2680.92
Netherlands they call that workshops

2677.8 --> 2683.1400000000003
it's like a course or something where

2680.92 --> 2685.96
you really get together with a group of

2683.14 --> 2688.06
Specialists and you figure out something

2685.96 --> 2689.92
and you get up to date

2688.06 --> 2693.599
I call that a workshop

2689.92 --> 2696.099
I really like the way they utilize that

2693.599 --> 2699.3590000000004
so that's why I've called it like that

2696.099 --> 2699.3590000000004
too it's like a workshop

2705.4 --> 2709.78
of course you have a visual weight yeah

2707.8 --> 2712.54
but that's all Supernatural influence

2709.78 --> 2714.46
Orinoco

2712.54 --> 2719.579
right it doesn't have actual weight

2714.46 --> 2723.3
because weight is a density metric

2719.579 --> 2723.3
caller does not have that

2723.839 --> 2728.619
brainstorming right yeah well

2725.56 --> 2731.2
brainstorming too but it's not just that

2728.619 --> 2734.099
right Workshop it does definitely

2731.2 --> 2737.74
include brainstorming but it also

2734.099 --> 2740.52
includes just creativity

2737.74 --> 2740.52
maintenance

2742.02 --> 2748.72
and just spreading good lore among one

2746.5 --> 2751.42
another making sure that everything is

2748.72 --> 2754.4199999999996
connected and tested right oh something

2751.42 --> 2757.119
new we got to figure out this new thing

2754.42 --> 2759.46
to see if it's safe viable should we

2757.119 --> 2761.38
adapt should we discard right

2759.46 --> 2763.7400000000002
those are all things you do in a

2761.38 --> 2763.7400000000002
workshop

2768.02 --> 2771.199
[Music]

2772.42 --> 2775.38
oh you don't

2776.56 --> 2780.22
your what was in response to their

2778.48 --> 2784.38
stupid questions about the weight of

2780.22 --> 2784.3799999999997
colors yeah so annoying

2790.599 --> 2795.76
oh wow

2792.4 --> 2797.8
gee that's amazing

2795.76 --> 2800.5600000000004
did you see that

2797.8 --> 2803.92
that's amazing man I mean

2800.56 --> 2806.56
I've never looked at up the word

2803.92 --> 2810.359
what you just rolled out there describes

2806.56 --> 2810.359
exactly what I thought

2812.26 --> 2818.2200000000003
that's amazing

2815.14 --> 2818.22
that's amazing

2820.72 --> 2823.6189999999997
huh

2825.52 --> 2829.2
I mean I keep doing this

2830.319 --> 2836.44
I just recognize words

2833.5 --> 2838.9
and it's like yeah it's just that word I

2836.44 --> 2841.3
don't get like oh I get an unfolded in

2838.9 --> 2843.4
my mind like oh this and that that's

2841.3 --> 2845.98
just that word I just yeah I know that

2843.4 --> 2847.78
that word is exactly the right word for

2845.98 --> 2849.64
this thing that I'm talking about right

2847.78 --> 2852.3390000000004
now

2849.64 --> 2854.7999999999997
and then I realize

2852.339 --> 2857.74
I don't actually know with certainty

2854.8 --> 2860.8590000000004
what this means like in my mind it

2857.74 --> 2863.4399999999996
doesn't have any backfolders so then I

2860.859 --> 2866.68
look up the word afterward and then I'm

2863.44 --> 2868.44
like what the [ __ ] that's exactly what I

2866.68 --> 2871.2999999999997
wanted it to mean

2868.44 --> 2874.5
how did I know that when I didn't

2871.3 --> 2874.5
consciously know that

2874.68 --> 2881.3799999999997
that's something that happens to me

2878.099 --> 2884.319
quite frequently in the last few years

2881.38 --> 2887.38
it's really bizarre

2884.319 --> 2890.02
that I just like I know it's this word

2887.38 --> 2891.28
and I use it and then afterward it's

2890.02 --> 2893.14
like wait

2891.28 --> 2895.3590000000004
I don't actually know what that words

2893.14 --> 2897.52
mean with certainty let me look it up

2895.359 --> 2901.839
and then oh [ __ ] it means exactly

2897.52 --> 2905.56
whatever every time I I have not looked

2901.839 --> 2908.68
up a word that I've used in retrospect

2905.56 --> 2912.96
and then came to like oh [ __ ] I was

2908.68 --> 2912.96
totally off I mean never

2914.859 --> 2920.7999999999997
if I was off then I would know it even

2918.28 --> 2922.8390000000004
as I looked it up I was never like

2920.8 --> 2925.0
surprised as like oh [ __ ] that doesn't

2922.839 --> 2927.339
mean what I that doesn't mean what I

2925.0 --> 2929.56
thought at all that doesn't happen I

2927.339 --> 2932.46
can't feel it coming like I think this

2929.56 --> 2932.46
is completely wrong

2932.5 --> 2938.2
and then usually it is

2935.2 --> 2941.859
and then I figure out like how was it

2938.2 --> 2944.2
twisted in my mind to to be slightly off

2941.859 --> 2947.0789999999997
like what alternative word was I

2944.2 --> 2949.7799999999997
actually trying to think about right

2947.079 --> 2951.9
but I get it more right than wrong these

2949.78 --> 2951.9
days

2954.04 --> 2959.38
it's really fascinating

2956.8 --> 2961.1800000000003
I mean it is actually fascinating to me

2959.38 --> 2965.6800000000003
because of well

2961.18 --> 2970.2999999999997
the lack of tangible to me consciousness

2965.68 --> 2974.859
it's like how do I know this that's mad

2970.3 --> 2977.619
that feels magical like I know this how

2974.859 --> 2980.56
do I know this what I do not consciously

2977.619 --> 2982.02
have a grasp on it how how is that even

2980.56 --> 2987.2999999999997
possible

2982.02 --> 2987.3
why does that work it's magical

2988.599 --> 2994.1800000000003
it's really

2991.24 --> 2996.4599999999996
it makes me feel very young

2994.18 --> 2999.46
because I had that a lot when I was very

2996.46 --> 3002.2200000000003
young I knew entire things and would

2999.46 --> 3004.5
just roll out things then I literally

3002.22 --> 3006.24
never heard before or never had a

3004.5 --> 3008.7
conversation about

3006.24 --> 3011.3999999999996
like not even like hearing it on TV or

3008.7 --> 3013.74
overhearing conversation like how and

3011.4 --> 3016.8
then afterward I'm like no I always knew

3013.74 --> 3019.56
this wait where did I pick this up

3016.8 --> 3020.7000000000003
I did not pick this up where how do I

3019.56 --> 3023.2799999999997
know this

3020.7 --> 3026.64
that sort of stuff happened to me like

3023.28 --> 3028.5600000000004
especially my pre-teens continually and

3026.64 --> 3031.859
I got a little obsessed with it and then

3028.56 --> 3033.54
because of that it got locked off and it

3031.859 --> 3035.4
got depressed I didn't have the impulse

3033.54 --> 3037.98
anymore and I thought for a while that I

3035.4 --> 3039.359
lost it forever and then it just started

3037.98 --> 3041.94
to come back again

3039.359 --> 3044.7
it's like if I really over focus on it

3041.94 --> 3047.3
then it's like pushed off it's close it

3044.7 --> 3047.2999999999997
closes off

3048.9 --> 3055.4
but it does go open again it's weird

3053.16 --> 3055.3999999999996
foreign

3059.04 --> 3064.8
would you use the Oxford

3062.16 --> 3066.5989999999997
English dictionary review it's okay to

3064.8 --> 3071.2400000000002
trust by your standard oh that all

3066.599 --> 3071.2400000000002
depends in this case it was perfect

3071.64 --> 3077.52
but yeah there's a lot of lingual

3074.099 --> 3080.579
corruption creeping in but most of that

3077.52 --> 3083.099
corruption is really the new invention

3080.579 --> 3085.5
of words it's like new language they're

3083.099 --> 3088.619
trying to invent and being all trans and

3085.5 --> 3090.9
blah all that garbage right but the

3088.619 --> 3093.839
thing is is that people that just hold

3090.9 --> 3095.7000000000003
on to the old language to the well the

3093.839 --> 3097.38
reliable

3095.7 --> 3100.2
language

3097.38 --> 3102.599
they don't even know those words exist

3100.2 --> 3104.2799999999997
and they don't give a [ __ ] it's their

3102.599 --> 3106.92
freaking safe space language that's

3104.28 --> 3108.6600000000003
being added and nobody gives a [ __ ] but

3106.92 --> 3111.66
the people that use that

3108.66 --> 3113.94
so it's not really as a change in the

3111.66 --> 3116.7799999999997
language even right so when you're just

3113.94 --> 3116.78
looking up things

3117.18 --> 3124.5589999999997
like a workshop then well that's still

3121.02 --> 3127.38
of the old class so that's makes perfect

3124.559 --> 3130.1400000000003
sense right and that's how I see it new

3127.38 --> 3132.7200000000003
corruption is usually the introduction

3130.14 --> 3135.359
of new [ __ ] that nobody cares about so

3132.72 --> 3138.48
it's not going to be in the way the real

3135.359 --> 3141.2599999999998
problem comes is when they literally try

3138.48 --> 3145.38
to change

3141.26 --> 3147.2400000000002
very normal used words and [ __ ] like the

3145.38 --> 3148.859
the times when he attempted to say oh

3147.24 --> 3152.5789999999997
you

3148.859 --> 3155.22
saying father and mother is outdated you

3152.579 --> 3159.6600000000003
can't say that anymore right that's

3155.22 --> 3163.319
that's if a dictionary

3159.66 --> 3166.14
would start to get weird and off results

3163.319 --> 3168.66
because of that now that serious

3166.14 --> 3172.2799999999997
corruption because that's in in the

3168.66 --> 3172.2799999999997
normal level right

3173.28 --> 3176.4
that's a problem

3175.02 --> 3179.42
but look

3176.4 --> 3182.64
there is still so

3179.42 --> 3185.339
much language out there

3182.64 --> 3187.2599999999998
it would take them a thousand year to

3185.339 --> 3190.38
try to catch up and corrupt it all it's

3187.26 --> 3194.4
just not doable it doesn't work

3190.38 --> 3196.2000000000003
English language was a weapon it was a

3194.4 --> 3198.7200000000003
weapon of culture

3196.2 --> 3200.3999999999996
that was made over

3198.72 --> 3204.48
countless

3200.4 --> 3206.579
generations with great dedication and

3204.48 --> 3208.559
care

3206.579 --> 3211.26
and I'd like to think that there was

3208.559 --> 3213.48
like a Divine Mission behind it even

3211.26 --> 3217.38
not just conquering

3213.48 --> 3219.78
but also about ordering cohesion and

3217.38 --> 3222.839
and adapting there was a vision behind

3219.78 --> 3225.2400000000002
English the creation of it

3222.839 --> 3227.16
and I don't think they can corrupt it

3225.24 --> 3229.74
they just won't be able to catch up

3227.16 --> 3232.22
there's too much of it

3229.74 --> 3232.22
anyway

3241.68 --> 3246.4199999999996
since 1937 oh yeah MC Banner thank you

3244.8 --> 3248.76
for sharing that that's funny because

3246.42 --> 3250.6800000000003
that's also around the time when Rudolph

3248.76 --> 3253.7400000000002
Steiner starts to

3250.68 --> 3256.98
do that and I think that it might be a

3253.74 --> 3259.4399999999996
very rule of steineresque use of word

3256.98 --> 3262.26
he talks about workshops

3259.44 --> 3264.059
my healer talks about workshops my dad

3262.26 --> 3266.6600000000003
talks about workshops and it's always

3264.059 --> 3269.1600000000003
kind of related to that direction

3266.66 --> 3271.0789999999997
Rudolph Steiner

3269.16 --> 3274.14
things

3271.079 --> 3276.6600000000003
so yeah maybe that's where it came from

3274.14 --> 3279.74
funny that it would be officially

3276.66 --> 3279.74
altered like that

3280.319 --> 3284.0589999999997
but I think it's a pretty good word

3288.3 --> 3293.6400000000003
what PJ cruising

3291.119 --> 3296.7200000000003
level now means no that's only with

3293.64 --> 3296.72
anti-flatter there's

3303.059 --> 3305.6600000000003
what

3305.7 --> 3308.7
foreign

3309.35 --> 3313.5699999999997
[Music]

3317.4 --> 3320.4
right

3320.7 --> 3325.0789999999997
but the thing is is p if people just

3322.859 --> 3327.0589999999997
don't care as long as like the normal

3325.079 --> 3329.4
understanding and meaning of the

3327.059 --> 3332.0400000000004
generally used language doesn't

3329.4 --> 3334.14
get altered or mutilated

3332.04 --> 3336.9
people don't even care that there's all

3334.14 --> 3340.02
kinds of new garbage words being

3336.9 --> 3341.819
put in there because a bunch of retards

3340.02 --> 3345.68
are using that

3341.819 --> 3345.68
right doesn't matter

3351.359 --> 3359.9
right yeah no that's that's fine

3355.94 --> 3359.9
[Music]

3370.92 --> 3377.04
right yeah that's no problem see but I'm

3373.5 --> 3380.28
just literally giving my just letting my

3377.04 --> 3382.2599999999998
mind claws latch onto it and figure it

3380.28 --> 3384.7200000000003
out like every piece of information

3382.26 --> 3386.3390000000004
whether it's true or not is a puzzle to

3384.72 --> 3389.16
me

3386.339 --> 3391.14
is what I do

3389.16 --> 3392.94
right and then afterwards you can figure

3391.14 --> 3394.5589999999997
out whether it was true or not and then

3392.94 --> 3398.3
if it wasn't true well you could just

3394.559 --> 3398.3
throw it all in the garbage no problem

3401.579 --> 3405.5
so the Mind exercise

3406.859 --> 3409.64
to me anyway

3419.819 --> 3423.98
all right I'm gonna sleep with one eye

3421.8 --> 3423.98
open

3430.579 --> 3434.48
pyramid

3432.619 --> 3438.0
param

3434.48 --> 3440.46
parambulator what the hell

3438.0 --> 3443.42
what the hell kind of word is that

3440.46 --> 3443.42
never heard of that

3445.02 --> 3450.0
wait they turned Omnibus into bus that's

3448.68 --> 3453.859
lame

3450.0 --> 3453.859
Omnibus is a pretty cool word

3465.599 --> 3471.8
well PJ seen it I don't to be fair I

3468.18 --> 3471.7999999999997
don't really know what a pram is either

3489.3 --> 3492.42
yeah these are all very alien words to

3491.76 --> 3495.5400000000004
me

3492.42 --> 3499.079
gotta realize that a lot of my knowledge

3495.54 --> 3500.4
has also come through the Dutch language

3499.079 --> 3503.94
which

3500.4 --> 3506.1600000000003
some cases is remarkably parallel to

3503.94 --> 3508.2000000000003
English but in other cases is like

3506.16 --> 3509.64
completely different

3508.2 --> 3511.859
and that that makes it kind of

3509.64 --> 3514.4
disconnect

3511.859 --> 3514.4
all right

3520.92 --> 3526.819
it's a stolen word stolen what he means

3524.28 --> 3526.8190000000004
stolen

3526.92 --> 3533.059
I don't think anybody claimed ownership

3529.799 --> 3533.059
for Latin anymore

3552.119 --> 3557.059
open the Latin Wormhole again yeah yeah

3560.04 --> 3563.54
you don't have to be sorry

3569.579 --> 3574.5
all right well Orinoco bumble

3572.339 --> 3577.859
the word pram

3574.5 --> 3580.28
has a very different meaning here in

3577.859 --> 3580.2799999999997
Dutch

3581.94 --> 3589.16
so that's a word that it would never be

3585.119 --> 3589.1600000000003
able to basically connect up with

3590.28 --> 3593.059
foreign

3598.91 --> 3602.08
[Music]

3602.18 --> 3609.299
I know I've literally

3605.579 --> 3611.8390000000004
forged words with it myself I know Omni

3609.299 --> 3611.839
means all

3617.16 --> 3622.74
right like when I was designing uh

3620.339 --> 3625.0789999999997
spells for my DND book

3622.74 --> 3627.0
there were a whole bunch of spells that

3625.079 --> 3629.52
were supposed to be like the ultimate

3627.0 --> 3632.16
Pinnacle of that power

3629.52 --> 3633.299
and then I would call them Omni

3632.16 --> 3635.8799999999997
it's like

3633.299 --> 3638.28
omniport

3635.88 --> 3640.38
it's teleport except you can literally

3638.28 --> 3643.1400000000003
go everywhere

3640.38 --> 3645.359
that is possible

3643.14 --> 3647.819
through the dimensions it within the

3645.359 --> 3649.92
dimensions any distance

3647.819 --> 3651.96
right omnipore is like the ultimate

3649.92 --> 3653.7000000000003
teleportation of God so I call it

3651.96 --> 3656.76
omniport

3653.7 --> 3659.339
I know it I know that word I mean

3656.76 --> 3661.98
some of these words that are from Latin

3659.339 --> 3667.5
are just really interesting they have

3661.98 --> 3671.2400000000002
like this charge to them so I use that

3667.5 --> 3671.24
like even 10 years ago

3689.579 --> 3691.579
um

3694.28 --> 3702.2000000000003
perambulator someone who roams

3699.359 --> 3702.2
okay

3710.96 --> 3714.599
weird

3712.799 --> 3717.559
anyway I'm gonna round out the show

3714.599 --> 3717.559
sorry guys

3717.66 --> 3720.3799999999997
wait what

3721.44 --> 3725.4
hmm

3723.24 --> 3727.799
okay yeah there should be a life letter

3725.4 --> 3730.76
of debates although Nathan's PC is

3727.799 --> 3730.7599999999998
updating apparently

3731.78 --> 3735.6800000000003
so he might be a little late

3753.73 --> 3759.199
[Music]

3759.599 --> 3763.619
okay

3760.74 --> 3767.64
I think I'll go on a little longer I

3763.619 --> 3770.339
started an hour late anyway so why not

3767.64 --> 3772.799
I'll just keep going until Nathan posts

3770.339 --> 3774.18

3772.799 --> 3776.359
apparently starting a little late as

3774.18 --> 3776.359
well

3776.4 --> 3779.839
I'll just keep going for a bit

3784.12 --> 3788.64
