6.28 --> 29.229000000000003
[Music]

32.32 --> 34.38
you

41.77 --> 48.650000000000006
good morning welcome to flatter the

45.68 --> 50.06
earlybird number 421 I'm your host

48.65 --> 51.65
Arwen and before we start the show

50.06 --> 55.489000000000004
please don't forget to share it

51.65 --> 57.8
Oh on any platform you deem fit and my

55.489 --> 59.18
volume is little oh I see and if you

57.8 --> 60.86
haven't already subscribed to my channel

59.18 --> 62.36
and hit the bell notification so you

60.86 --> 63.47
know when I'm going live which is

62.36 --> 66.83
normally 2:00 p.m.

63.47 --> 69.08
Amsterdam time every day please also do

66.83 --> 71.75
support me through the paypal patreon my

69.08 --> 75.619
GoFundMe and the super chats it's kind

71.75 --> 81.08
of urgent now it would be much

75.619 --> 84.2
appreciated and get back to that anyway

81.08 --> 87.61
the weather today is it's kind of great

84.2 --> 87.61
it's not rainy though

92.58 --> 94.67
and

95.01 --> 103.44
yeah I have a comforter over there don't

99.45 --> 117.38
know what it is do you see that I don't

103.44 --> 117.38
know anyway today I have joke what that

117.8 --> 123.81
Wow

119.22 --> 127.68
what the hell was that why was it all

123.81 --> 132.8
blacked out that was a weird anyway yeah

127.68 --> 132.8
I got green tea with me today that's it

138.29 --> 145.23
yeah so let's see wasn't Jeff yeah that

144.0 --> 150.54
was weird wasn't it Nathan

145.23 --> 153.83999999999997
anyway mark marshall was first a GM

150.54 --> 159.76999999999998
Giulio Pavan I'm and a human good

153.84 --> 160.92000000000002
servant over moco Anthony Dickinson a GM

159.77 --> 164.64000000000001
Cleary

160.92 --> 166.94
it's an Oakland 90 80 yeah good to see

164.64 --> 166.94
you all

167.86 --> 177.64000000000001
so yeah yesterday I was up all night

173.02 --> 179.62
just all night it's just insane

177.64 --> 185.29
I think I've stayed up until 6:00 it's

179.62 --> 188.83
just I guess that my worries kept me

185.29 --> 191.62
awake and also Oh Benjamin because yeah

188.83 --> 194.71
two streams yesterday first one was

191.62 --> 198.19
plenty of amusing the second one which

194.71 --> 201.70000000000002
was really freaking laces but I was

198.19 --> 206.07999999999998
still glad to catch it because he had so

201.7 --> 211.08999999999997
much energy and he just put down some

206.08 --> 214.18
really fascinating concepts concerning

211.09 --> 219.13
how what they tell about evolution to us

214.18 --> 222.34
is pretty much metaphorically for for

219.13 --> 225.69
our for the stages of our procreation

222.34 --> 229.63
and I thought it was a fair fascinating

225.69 --> 233.35
correlative concept and yeah may

229.63 --> 240.60999999999999
definitely be something to it and yeah

233.35 --> 243.60999999999999
so that was very good also yeah I wanted

240.61 --> 247.239
to do a never have to show but Nathan's

243.61 --> 250.019
after-show just lasted forever I think

247.239 --> 253.65
it lasted literally four hours was crazy

250.019 --> 259.12
so yeah I would have strained it but

253.65 --> 261.69
yeah Nathan already did do bad maybe

259.12 --> 261.69
next time

270.79 --> 276.84000000000003
yeah yeah Nathan isn't that symbolic

280.02 --> 287.81
Yeah right so you have for starters I

284.57 --> 292.23
don't think I'm gonna do a show tomorrow

287.81 --> 297.8
and not to share about after that as

292.23 --> 297.8
well because yeah

302.84 --> 310.94
it's pretty much run to a dead end now

305.87 --> 312.91
financially as I predicted and probably

310.94 --> 318.169
not gonna be able to smoke for a while

312.91 --> 320.36
and ya don't really feel like sharing

318.169 --> 327.08
that phase with you guys if you know

320.36 --> 330.26
what I mean so yeah that's that's what

327.08 --> 332.24
it's gonna be so I hope you appreciate

330.26 --> 334.34
this show I'm gonna do a long show today

332.24 --> 341.74
because of course it's Saturday but

334.34 --> 345.85999999999996
might be the last for a while because

341.74 --> 346.63
it's predicted it's just not gonna work

345.86 --> 350.95
out

346.63 --> 357.979
yeah despite that despite everything so

350.95 --> 361.39
but why not because I'm broke

357.979 --> 361.39
very very broke

364.72 --> 375.43
it's not Saturday wait isn't it oh [Â __Â ]

369.61 --> 375.94
you're right oh yeah I know why it's so

375.43 --> 379.3
weird

375.94 --> 381.21999999999997
yep it's because once very specific

379.3 --> 381.94
video maker have been following for like

381.22 --> 385.87
20 years

381.94 --> 388.09
wait too long he always pumps out videos

385.87 --> 390.1
on Friday and for some reason he posted

388.09 --> 393.15999999999997
it yesterday was very odd so I guess

390.1 --> 397.21000000000004
that's why I think it's this is Saturday

393.16 --> 399.13000000000005
instead of Friday so yeah i guess i'll

397.21 --> 403.15
do another hangout tomorrow maybe i

399.13 --> 411.96999999999997
don't know for sure i'm not gonna be in

403.15 --> 420.17999999999995
a good mood so it is but yeah today is

411.97 --> 425.23
friday he's just weird but yeah sunday i

420.18 --> 427.57
had roughly a game planned with the

425.23 --> 433.51
gamers again finally after almost a

427.57 --> 435.4
month and it's gonna be in the afternoon

433.51 --> 440.86
and i'm just not gonna have a lot of

435.4 --> 445.34999999999997
time for a hangout as well and well

440.86 --> 445.35
we'll see about tomorrow we'll see

452.209 --> 465.92900000000003
but yeah interesting developments the

462.809 --> 467.759
diffraction the horizon being caused an

465.929 --> 471.659
effect being caused by the diffraction

467.759 --> 473.639
and then it's kind of funny because yeah

471.659 --> 475.139
I pretty much concluded that before but

473.639 --> 477.329
I didn't really understand what that

475.139 --> 482.519
fraction was in the face of all the

477.329 --> 486.769
optical effects back then but I think I

482.519 --> 490.169
get it now what that is

486.769 --> 493.439
could this yeah I could probably even

490.169 --> 496.37899999999996
describe it in autographic view because

493.439 --> 501.53900000000004
of the yeah the vertical aspects of it

496.379 --> 504.209
so what the horizon would basically be

501.539 --> 510.36
like and yeah I'm go to the hand

504.209 --> 515.189
describe it it's gonna be a surface some

510.36 --> 518.339
kind of surface right somebody's gonna

515.189 --> 521.9689999999999
watch over that and depending on the

518.339 --> 526.2790000000001
distance eventually the view will be so

521.969 --> 530.879
parallel that the the close proximity

526.279 --> 536.22
will cause the light to yeah as soon as

530.879 --> 539.5690000000001
it hits that critical angle going very

536.22 --> 542.49
close past it it subtly dips down and

539.569 --> 546.12
that's diffraction it suddenly dips down

542.49 --> 549.48
but as it dips down it also reflects it

546.12 --> 553.589
and that's from that critical point on

549.48 --> 559.889
everything reflect and so you see a

553.589 --> 561.9300000000001
reflection you see a sudden stop off for

559.889 --> 564.66
example that water line and then

561.93 --> 567.3
suddenly you just see the sky being

564.66 --> 569.79
reflected of it and that's directly

567.3 --> 572.699
caused by the critical angle causing

569.79 --> 574.529
that fraction certain been down in close

572.699 --> 578.0799999999999
proximity and after that it's just

574.529 --> 587.41
reflection see see that's what it is

578.08 --> 590.11
it's amazing I get it now it's the

587.41 --> 593.26
sudden dip and after that everything

590.11 --> 595.899
just reflects and with how it reflects

593.26 --> 598.0889999999999
the pen of course on the nature of the

595.899 --> 601.149
surfaces they're present with which what

598.089 --> 603.1600000000001
with water can be and regular there's

601.149 --> 606.279
irregular surfaces because it is not

603.16 --> 608.62
perfectly straight so the after the

606.279 --> 611.05
diffraction horizon point the

608.62 --> 617.589
reflections are gonna still be based on

611.05 --> 620.62
the averaging reflecting on the angles

617.589 --> 623.1700000000001
of the surface that it's gonna reflect

620.62 --> 625.12
from because it's still gonna have

623.17 --> 628.029
influence and that's gonna basically

625.12 --> 630.94
cause everything that is apparently

628.029 --> 635.47
reflected beyond that horizon points to

630.94 --> 637.72
be kind of a mash-up unless everything

635.47 --> 639.3100000000001
behind her rice boat is absolutely

637.72 --> 641.0500000000001
perfectly straight and then it will

639.31 --> 647.29
become a much more straightforward

641.05 --> 651.51
mirror reflection to see it just it

647.29 --> 651.51
works out works out perfectly

654.12 --> 659.5
the funny thing is you don't technically

656.86 --> 661.36
even have to drag perspective in it the

659.5 --> 664.389
perspective is only gonna have some

661.36 --> 669.5790000000001
influence because things might just

664.389 --> 671.819
become too small so that after the

669.579 --> 677.2589999999999
horizon point they will just be

671.819 --> 680.019
completely concealed behind ya behind or

677.259 --> 684.24
below the reflection because everything

680.019 --> 687.2090000000001
is going to be going over its head and

684.24 --> 690.97
yeah the farther away it is the less

687.209 --> 694.949
angular size it has to take up in order

690.97 --> 700.089
for that reflection to bypass it

694.949 --> 701.889
remember optical slant the horizon

700.089 --> 706.23
pointer at the diffraction and then

701.889 --> 708.55
certainly that's literally the visual

706.23 --> 715.72
because that the light goes that way

708.55 --> 718.5999999999999
causing well things at the increasing

715.72 --> 724.8100000000001
rate in their size to become concealed

718.6 --> 726.4590000000001
within the reflection over distance let

724.81 --> 728.9399999999999
me see if I can track that picture in

726.459 --> 728.9399999999999
there again

729.81 --> 736.4799999999999
destruction tickle slant obstruction for

733.06 --> 738.52
ground I need to adapt the words because

736.48 --> 742.48
technically it works slightly different

738.52 --> 747.75
now but the picture still valid let me

742.48 --> 747.75
see how do I present this

757.27 --> 763.18
a bit of an issue let's see

760.18 --> 763.18
it's

772.34 --> 776.44
yeah I can do it like this ooh

778.07 --> 784.1500000000001
doesn't look good like that what maybe

781.46 --> 784.1500000000001
this is better

796.94 --> 802.7800000000001
oh geez oh my god

806.81 --> 815.05
Wow holy ass can be a real pain in the

812.6 --> 815.0500000000001
ass sometimes

822.69 --> 825.4100000000001
what

829.78 --> 839.5
okay it's messy but it's gonna have to

832.72 --> 842.11
do alright so this this little picture

839.5 --> 846.22
here still counts it's just the wordings

842.11 --> 849.88
are no longer completely correct and I

846.22 --> 852.28
could adapt it to true yeah not so much

849.88 --> 854.77
be descriptive anymore which I you

852.28 --> 856.66
that's what I based it on just if the

854.77 --> 860.68
optic yeah what I see in that

856.66 --> 864.85
descriptive part and then transit into a

860.68 --> 867.5799999999999
more light pathway based explanation

864.85 --> 868.87
that that is that I do actually

867.58 --> 871.0300000000001
understand that I'm not trying to

868.87 --> 873.27
improvise based on preliminary data that

871.03 --> 876.16
I'm getting which is what I used to do

873.27 --> 879.73
two years ago and the debates still was

876.16 --> 882.6999999999999
figuring it out but I think I can now

879.73 --> 886.14
finally fill that in properly with

882.7 --> 886.1400000000001
confidence so

893.95 --> 897.85
I don't know what I'm gonna be doing

895.69 --> 900.4590000000001
good servant I'll figure it out

897.85 --> 905.529
maybe I am gonna look for a job or

900.459 --> 911.7689999999999
whatever let's see if if it's still yeah

905.529 --> 915.88
if it if there may be some use to it to

911.769 --> 919.86
be fair I'm probably just gonna try

915.88 --> 919.86
couple things but

920.7 --> 926.19
yeah I'm gonna try to suppress my yeah

923.79 --> 928.4699999999999
negative expectations as you'll see what

926.19 --> 930.3800000000001
happens but yeah in reflection to

928.47 --> 933.09
everything that's happened in my past I

930.38 --> 937.07
you know it's an act of desperation and

933.09 --> 942.21
we'll see where it goes because yeah

937.07 --> 946.33
that's this is not working anymore it's

942.21 --> 949.44
also taking just my joy away in doing it

946.33 --> 949.44
[Music]

952.609 --> 955.759
you know

956.78 --> 959.88
[Music]

970.55 --> 977.12
[Music]

973.61 --> 980.78
I don't know if the consciousness got

977.12 --> 984.68
another boost Elijah Freeman I think

980.78 --> 988.22
it's a matter of letting things sink in

984.68 --> 991.13
and then certainly yeah letting things

988.22 --> 995.6
clear up and then hey if you have the

991.13 --> 998.78
general capacity you will start to see

995.6 --> 1000.64
connections where you before didn't see

998.78 --> 1004.3299999999999
it because everything was still very

1000.64 --> 1006.12
fresh and you still get the bigger and

1004.33 --> 1009.01
precious impressions from the

1006.12 --> 1012.49
preliminaries of the data the things

1009.01 --> 1014.62
that stand out the most and you the

1012.49 --> 1017.26
subtle connections are much tougher to

1014.62 --> 1021.61
see immediately sometimes it takes a

1017.26 --> 1024.1
long time to size everything all the

1021.61 --> 1025.8700000000001
preliminaries up properly and then

1024.1 --> 1028.12
figure out what the balance is and then

1025.87 --> 1031.9589999999998
when you get a good feel for that then

1028.12 --> 1036.339
certainly other connections may become

1031.959 --> 1038.3500000000001
more apparent or will stand out in in

1036.339 --> 1040.27
comparison to other potential

1038.35 --> 1043.839
connections as being real

1040.27 --> 1045.6399999999999
because yeah when you first get things a

1043.839 --> 1051.37
lot of new things especially if it's a

1045.64 --> 1053.65
new region of data then yeah you can see

1051.37 --> 1055.4499999999998
all kinds of correlations doesn't

1053.65 --> 1059.65
necessarily mean you're going to see

1055.45 --> 1063.72
which one are actually viable that's the

1059.65 --> 1063.72
thing that takes time so

1067.47 --> 1072.789
[Music]

1076.83 --> 1082.6399999999999
so really I am now Nathan Oakley Karen

1079.86 --> 1082.6399999999999
Cox do you think

1083.2 --> 1086.4
[Music]

1095.14 --> 1098.279
[Music]

1099.07 --> 1107.26
right hey it's up to you Karen Cox

1102.61 --> 1111.1
and others and yeah it seems to be like

1107.26 --> 1116.11
my audience is split halfway so yeah

1111.1 --> 1119.35
that's what's gonna happen no funding no

1116.11 --> 1122.4499999999998
Daily Show that's it

1119.35 --> 1122.4499999999998
[Music]

1128.12 --> 1131.29
[Music]

1134.81 --> 1140.1499999999999
all right yeah and if I am actually

1136.97 --> 1143.33
gonna in some way getting an a sort of

1140.15 --> 1148.72
job a daytime job yeah that's gonna be

1143.33 --> 1148.72
no more debates either yeah so

1151.29 --> 1158.1
I guess everybody has their own

1155.64 --> 1161.88
priorities as to what is most important

1158.1 --> 1166.32
to them and it's if hey if a group of

1161.88 --> 1168.45
people they're following me me doing

1166.32 --> 1171.21
this for like four years now and then

1168.45 --> 1174.24
the early virtue over a year hey if you

1171.21 --> 1175.8
guys think that yeah our win should get

1174.24 --> 1178.38
a job well that's fine

1175.8 --> 1181.2
okay priorities if you think that's so

1178.38 --> 1184.5200000000002
important then I'm gonna do that but

1181.2 --> 1184.52
that means this is over

1193.19 --> 1200.3700000000001
really you think so Karen Cox you do

1196.89 --> 1204.69
realize that I have a lot of insights

1200.37 --> 1206.9699999999998
and feedback from my complex theories

1204.69 --> 1208.5900000000001
that most people usually when they

1206.97 --> 1211.05
arrive don't even understand what the

1208.59 --> 1213.06
hell I'm talking about that I get a lot

1211.05 --> 1217.01
of development on the Flat Earth debates

1213.06 --> 1223.1399999999999
despite John being a dick constantly

1217.01 --> 1225.93
especially to me and Nathan but yet it's

1223.14 --> 1227.46
because it's nice and show and it's

1225.93 --> 1229.3500000000001
times when he just doesn't like to be

1227.46 --> 1232.05
interrupted I think I get it better now

1229.35 --> 1235.8
but that's just what it is but still get

1232.05 --> 1240.47
a lot of data there but yeah I'm not if

1235.8 --> 1240.47
I'm having a job and can't do that okay

1244.58 --> 1251.4199999999998
[Music]

1259.61 --> 1262.81
hello Karen be

1294.22 --> 1297.499
[Music]

1301.81 --> 1310.549
[Music]

1313.52 --> 1321.65
yeah no really bilgey work from home and

1317.6 --> 1321.6499999999999
well how

1335.41 --> 1338.13
weird

1339.42 --> 1346.22
I tell you maybe oh yeah that's so down

1342.36 --> 1350.61
my alley at this so talented at that

1346.22 --> 1353.8500000000001
right now if I would be able to do IT

1350.61 --> 1357.6599999999999
professionally you think that that

1353.85 --> 1365.4599999999998
wouldn't have showed on just the quality

1357.66 --> 1367.6100000000001
of my show or rather the decorations of

1365.46 --> 1367.6100000000001
it

1368.35 --> 1371.58
[Music]

1378.55 --> 1381.75
[Music]

1391.99 --> 1401.64
our Karen Cox the setup for Nathan works

1395.98 --> 1401.64
because his wife has a full time job

1401.7 --> 1407.6200000000001
relatively good-paying one and so

1405.31 --> 1412.24
anything he makes it actually goes on

1407.62 --> 1415.12
top of that and that's why it works well

1412.24 --> 1419.02
if you don't have a partner that has a

1415.12 --> 1422.26
full time job to put all this on top of

1419.02 --> 1424.15
yeah it's literally just as I said what

1422.26 --> 1427.23
I get from Google it's just taken out of

1424.15 --> 1427.23
my social welfare

1450.44 --> 1454.8400000000001
really can I now peanuts Clark

1458.33 --> 1465.1699999999998
well sure hey if everybody feels that

1460.82 --> 1467.36
way you know yeah I gave I get a gave a

1465.17 --> 1471.47
lot of concepts to the Flat Earth scene

1467.36 --> 1475.1599999999999
but hey if that's good enough for you

1471.47 --> 1480.6200000000001
and that means that it is time for our

1475.16 --> 1483.95
wing to go hey it's not my choice okay

1480.62 --> 1487.75
it's not the choice that I'd wanted but

1483.95 --> 1487.75
hey if everybody is all fine with that

1496.94 --> 1500.329
[Music]

1505.55 --> 1515.1789999999999
a really good servant so tell me tell me

1508.97 --> 1516.2
the choice tell me the choice just keep

1515.179 --> 1520.49
on doing this

1516.2 --> 1525.0800000000002
spending yeah almost a full day's work

1520.49 --> 1530.71
online actively doing stuff contributing

1525.08 --> 1534.47
to shows working out things and

1530.71 --> 1540.429
literally worrying about money every

1534.47 --> 1545.21
single day and yeah

1540.429 --> 1548.45
seeing that grow worse or just throwing

1545.21 --> 1550.88
it all in the garbage can build down all

1548.45 --> 1552.8300000000002
my faculties because it takes up a lot

1550.88 --> 1556.7
of focus and energy to maintain all that

1552.83 --> 1559.03
I know it is it's happened before like I

1556.7 --> 1563.75
had an after-school crash as well

1559.03 --> 1566.9289999999999
because when I graduated after that yeah

1563.75 --> 1569.87
I had was very trained and then like in

1566.929 --> 1572.63
two years I was as dumb as a freakin

1569.87 --> 1576.3799999999999
rock because I completely stepped away

1572.63 --> 1580.3090000000002
from it yeah yeah that's what happens

1576.38 --> 1583.5800000000002
that's what happens now I can get back

1580.309 --> 1589.82
if I don't take too long if I feel like

1583.58 --> 1591.71
it or I could say yes screw that I never

1589.82 --> 1595.34
want to be faced with these [Â __Â ]

1591.71 --> 1597.8600000000001
trolls again ever and I'll just be like

1595.34 --> 1601.49
oh my god I'm so glad I was able to step

1597.86 --> 1604.0
away from that [Â __Â ] that didn't make me

1601.49 --> 1604.0
any money

1608.07 --> 1612.989
yeah but what's the chances of me coming

1610.2 --> 1615.3590000000002
back after that you know what if I do

1612.989 --> 1622.71
actually find a full-time job that kind

1615.359 --> 1624.869
of fits me why would I come back if I

1622.71 --> 1627.71
could just focus on that on getting more

1624.869 --> 1630.359
maybe building some kind of social life

1627.71 --> 1632.309
why my head wouldn't be filled up with

1630.359 --> 1636.84
constant globe or [Â __Â ]

1632.309 --> 1639.45
and then maybe I would get a wife at

1636.84 --> 1646.32
some point you think I'd be coming back

1639.45 --> 1650.729
here oh really a stream after work why

1646.32 --> 1653.599
would I do that you know how much energy

1650.729 --> 1657.72
all of this takes up how much you focus

1653.599 --> 1665.279
what good would I be after a full day's

1657.72 --> 1668.46
work I don't see it now this is a job it

1665.279 --> 1671.039
is it is a job it is pretty much a

1668.46 --> 1673.47
full-time job it's just a full-time job

1671.039 --> 1675.95
I'm not getting paid for that's the

1673.47 --> 1675.95
difference

1680.869 --> 1690.9789999999998
yeah I think you're right Karen B I

1687.389 --> 1694.889
think I'm absolutely sick of that person

1690.979 --> 1698.099
she has done nothing but discourage me

1694.889 --> 1703.7099999999998
and every conceivable angle so piss off

1698.099 --> 1704.9089999999999
Karen Cox go somewhere else and care if

1703.71 --> 1709.6390000000001
you're a real person

1704.909 --> 1709.6390000000001
I don't need your input you suck

1712.1 --> 1715.1699999999998
[Music]

1719.48 --> 1736.13
I don't care who it is I just know the

1725.389 --> 1742.269
person sucks yeah right thanks for

1736.13 --> 1742.269
reminding me of that person great

1774.29 --> 1779.0
all right yeah bill G yeah hey look

1777.32 --> 1782.98
there's all kinds of things people can

1779.0 --> 1788.57
do you know when they have some room

1782.98 --> 1792.47
when they have a garden when they have a

1788.57 --> 1794.1499999999999
partner with their own income when they

1792.47 --> 1796.58
have this when they have that yeah I

1794.15 --> 1799.1000000000001
know it's lovely also all the

1796.58 --> 1801.02
possibilities in the world well can you

1799.1 --> 1805.82
find one of those possibilities that can

1801.02 --> 1810.17
fit with a guy or yeah living with other

1805.82 --> 1812.24
people having a little square box room

1810.17 --> 1814.52
available to them can you find any of

1812.24 --> 1816.73
those types of jobs that I could do

1814.52 --> 1819.47
because I can think of one of them I

1816.73 --> 1822.35
can't think of one of them that would

1819.47 --> 1824.8
basically force me to square away a

1822.35 --> 1830.32
quarter off the entire room making it

1824.8 --> 1830.32
unlivable so yeah

1836.1 --> 1840.75
yeah I know unicorn Slayer that's what

1839.76 --> 1846.41
I'm afraid of

1840.75 --> 1848.91
I'm afraid that if I can't keep this up

1846.41 --> 1851.46
because it's financially unviable

1848.91 --> 1853.92
because apparently people yeah whether

1851.46 --> 1855.93
they like me or not just can't support

1853.92 --> 1859.6200000000001
me because that's the feeling I got you

1855.93 --> 1864.51
know I spent an entire episode literally

1859.62 --> 1867.9299999999998
begging like being really serious and I

1864.51 --> 1870.54
got there was nothing and it's not like

1867.93 --> 1872.13
I me mad about it it's just that I'm

1870.54 --> 1876.99
kind of shocked because I really

1872.13 --> 1881.1000000000001
expected it something then again yeah I

1876.99 --> 1884.16
did get a big amount yeah from you to

1881.1 --> 1886.62
DANC on Saturday well maybe that was it

1884.16 --> 1888.9
maybe maybe that is everything you guys

1886.62 --> 1891.6599999999999
have gotten for a while maybe that is it

1888.9 --> 1893.3100000000002
well that's kind of disappointing that

1891.66 --> 1898.28
apparently there's not even that many

1893.31 --> 1898.28
finances to go around first place oh

1900.41 --> 1905.67
that's yeah I got a have foundation I

1904.32 --> 1907.74
gotta have funding I gotta have a

1905.67 --> 1911.13
foundation in order to keep this going

1907.74 --> 1913.47
and not constantly whine about money

1911.13 --> 1916.5900000000001
half of the time how about that you

1913.47 --> 1920.0
think I like that no it's a nightmare to

1916.59 --> 1920.0
me and I just wanted to stop

1924.56 --> 1930.8899999999999
[Music]

1926.36 --> 1930.8899999999999

1951.12 --> 1956.4299999999998
decorator yeah you know what hey if I'm

1954.9 --> 1959.94
gonna look around I'm gonna look around

1956.43 --> 1963.42
for whatever is what I could actually

1959.94 --> 1966.75
get without people whining about me not

1963.42 --> 1973.2
having enough papers you know so who

1966.75 --> 1975.21

biggest supporter maybe next to Rhys but

2216.95 --> 2220.0989999999997
yeah I don't know what races up to these

2218.69 --> 2222.2000000000003
days I haven't heard from him in a long

2220.099 --> 2224.2690000000002
time and you know he's kind of a baller

2222.2 --> 2228.519
now it's weird but yeah

2224.269 --> 2232.1499999999996
dank has I would still remember like

2228.519 --> 2238.8799999999997
danker it dropped some huge amount of

2232.15 --> 2241.4500000000003
super chats in February last year still

2238.88 --> 2241.4500000000003
remember that

2248.46 --> 2256.98
yeah thanks dank yeah my birthday is in

2252.63 --> 2266.05
three weeks from now six of February

2256.98 --> 2270.85
it's on a Thursday what

2266.05 --> 2272.23
yeah Karen B I didn't know it kind of

2270.85 --> 2274.69
slipped past me

2272.23 --> 2279.22
yeah the Reese guy I know only cheapo

2274.69 --> 2285.1
can see he was a great country like he

2279.22 --> 2288.5499999999997
really helped me and I could really use

2285.1 --> 2291.04
that help right now but yeah he I don't

2288.55 --> 2294.76
know he's just so fed up with Nathan and

2291.04 --> 2298.54
with the negativity with the attitude in

2294.76 --> 2300.9100000000003
the Flat Earth debates and he I find he

2298.54 --> 2304.05
finds it unacceptable that I am part of

2300.91 --> 2308.2
that apparently and I'm shocked

2304.05 --> 2310.96
I've tried to explain to him like yeah I

2308.2 --> 2312.9399999999996
am not happy about it either but I'm

2310.96 --> 2318.61
just trying to find my way through and

2312.94 --> 2322.9900000000002
even try to help correct attitudes a

2318.61 --> 2325.96
little somewhat sort of just I'm general

2322.99 --> 2330.7
support but now Reese finds it

2325.96 --> 2333.43
intolerable Reese and Merle sound

2330.7 --> 2335.47
identical my god that you couldn't be

2333.43 --> 2340.69
more wrong dang it that's just a

2335.47 --> 2343.23
terrible the reason have an unstable

2340.69 --> 2343.23
voice

2348.32 --> 2358.179
anyway right

2355.03 --> 2358.179
[Music]

2360.65 --> 2370.789
o-over Marco I think so but I just get

2365.99 --> 2372.9799999999996
the feeling that in certain ways his

2370.789 --> 2378.38
skin is not thick enough to handle all

2372.98 --> 2381.41
of this and yeah there are so few people

2378.38 --> 2385.2200000000003
out there that can actually have another

2381.41 --> 2386.799
really aren't just kind of forced into a

2385.22 --> 2390.97
weird position in some way

2386.799 --> 2390.97
psychologically by all of this

2397.91 --> 2403.0699999999997
Oh Michels missed okay who said I

2401.75 --> 2406.91
invited you

2403.07 --> 2408.79
yes this is now I don't think I'm

2406.91 --> 2411.8599999999997

2472.12 --> 2475.96
[Music]

2480.11 --> 2488.01
[Music]

2491.109 --> 2501.43
yeah anyway y'all come to your house oh

2500.739 --> 2503.7690000000002

2506.859 --> 2513.279
party well I hope it's gonna be good

2508.69 --> 2517.539
weather then probably not this it tends

2513.279 --> 2521.16
to snow on my birthday like even if

2517.539 --> 2524.469
doesn't snow like the entire year long

2521.16 --> 2527.95
perhaps like in the last 10 years oh

2524.469 --> 2529.359
that almost every birthday it snowed for

2527.95 --> 2536.14
some reason not a lot of snow

2529.359 --> 2539.7
necessarily but it did so weird even if

2536.14 --> 2539.7
just for a day or something too

2544.91 --> 2548.89
oh damn bill geez that sucks

2558.1 --> 2562.0299999999997
yeah that crows and you're not gonna be

2560.26 --> 2565.84
able to meet that crow I haven't seen

2562.03 --> 2569.2900000000004
that grow in in over a month or three

2565.84 --> 2576.0
weeks at least I think he's gone or dead

2569.29 --> 2576.0
I don't know yeah too bad

2589.539 --> 2595.2290000000003
8 p.m. Eastern u.s. are you serious

Larry

2612.22 --> 2620.31
I don't know if he died peanuts Clark I

2618.369 --> 2623.98
just haven't seen him for three weeks

2620.31 --> 2626.25
even though I do still recognize the two

2623.98 --> 2630.66
other crows that usually accompanied it

2626.25 --> 2630.66
so it's gone I don't know where it is

2635.55 --> 2658.0890000000004
now a matrix media now I haven't found

2647.95 --> 2659.41
any dead crows peanuts Clark none it's

2658.089 --> 2664.39
just not here anymore

2659.41 --> 2667.23
I don't know maybe a cat a got him or

2664.39 --> 2667.23
something you know

2693.369 --> 2696.369
yeah

2711.47 --> 2716.6189999999997
Hannah Boban or what

2724.13 --> 2731.06
all right anyway yeah thanks again dank

2728.06 --> 2731.06
it's

2735.45 --> 2741.21
yeah people underestimate how much it

2738.0 --> 2744.21
really matters when people do actually

2741.21 --> 2748.26
help me when I need it and even though

2744.21 --> 2752.4
it's technically a little bit I'm

2748.26 --> 2756.21
slightly less pissed off now and I'm

2752.4 --> 2759.15
very thankful to DANC for yeah kind of

2756.21 --> 2763.079
being there for me just hope others will

2759.15 --> 2769.4
be find a way to to chip in as well

2763.079 --> 2769.4
because I need some to get going like

2771.44 --> 2778.2000000000003
and I guess since there is something

2775.559 --> 2786.75
rolling don't completely have to give up

2778.2 --> 2787.3999999999996
now right hey and if you can't keep me

2786.75 --> 2790.74
going

2787.4 --> 2793.2000000000003
there's also promise of happy ever after

2790.74 --> 2795.2099999999996
show so you know that's worth it there's

2793.2 --> 2798.3489999999997
going to be expansion on this show I I

2795.21 --> 2801.089
wanted to try it yesterday

2798.349 --> 2804.059
but yeah didn't work out because Nathan

2801.089 --> 2806.91
just took the whole thing but yeah

2804.059 --> 2810.7690000000002
that's gonna happen I'm gonna now I have

2806.91 --> 2814.5789999999997
it all set up in OBS I can record the

2810.769 --> 2817.109
happy-ever-after show and then I will

2814.579 --> 2819.5
livestream it playing the video kind of

2817.109 --> 2822.269
like what rentee does and I can do that

2819.5 --> 2825.599
yeah but it is kind of conditional

2822.269 --> 2828.4799999999996
though because guess what I'll be have

2825.599 --> 2830.549
to be present there pretty much the

2828.48 --> 2833.339
whole video that I'm gonna play so

2830.549 --> 2838.279
depending on how long it is I could just

2833.339 --> 2838.279
walk away at points maybe but

2840.109 --> 2845.42
it's not gonna work out if I'm certainly

2842.73 --> 2848.069
gonna be doing a job pretty sure of it

2845.42 --> 2849.869
because I have to be there as the show

2848.069 --> 2852.63
is getting recorded and around it out

2849.869 --> 2854.73
and then I have to process it and then

2852.63 --> 2858.7200000000003
be there to play yeah

2854.73 --> 2862.8
takes a lot more time yet this that this

2858.72 --> 2867.5589999999997
is a full-time job people it is it is a

2862.8 --> 2867.559
full-time job and a need to get by

2871.91 --> 2875.8199999999997
[Music]

2876.269 --> 2882.9289999999996
yeah and yesterday the yesterday's show

2878.729 --> 2887.3089999999997
was fantastic by the way I really want

2882.929 --> 2890.6890000000003
to thank Randy and Tony for yeah for

2887.309 --> 2893.429
just inserting all that energy into it

2890.689 --> 2895.0789999999997
Tony just kept on going man that guy

2893.429 --> 2899.339
just woke up with so much energy

2895.079 --> 2903.239
yesterday it's insane like even during

2899.339 --> 2905.489
the ever the ever after show Randy or

2903.239 --> 2907.709
during the after show I mean there

2905.489 --> 2910.909
wasn't ever after show Randy just went

2907.709 --> 2915.029
live with Tony I didn't see it though

2910.909 --> 2916.9790000000003
but that kept on going for a while but

2915.029 --> 2919.249
yeah they were on yesterday and it was

2916.979 --> 2919.249
good

2927.24 --> 2934.5789999999997
a leash I don't know who that is

2931.2 --> 2934.5789999999997
and there's days

2944.24 --> 2950.3799999999997
a Chris Barry Bailey

2966.26 --> 2976.46
but tiny bumble that you it's all filled

2971.9 --> 2978.89
up and besides after Nathan's show there

2976.46 --> 2981.52
is the after-show and I'm usually still

2978.89 --> 2981.52
a part of that

3005.59 --> 3011.01
I have no idea who that is Anders days

3008.17 --> 3011.01
never heard of the name

3011.22 --> 3014.35
[Music]

3034.9 --> 3043.369
aquascaping what is that an echo Ella do

3041.33 --> 3045.98
you mean underwater shots of people

3043.369 --> 3049.73
swimming in in tropical oceans and

3045.98 --> 3053.47
everything because yeah those videos can

3049.73 --> 3053.47
be very appealing I would get it

3054.07 --> 3061.4900000000002
although I think maybe for the Dutch

3059.17 --> 3063.32
during winter times and all that and

3061.49 --> 3066.14
fall when it's rainy

3063.32 --> 3069.56
watching people in the water may not be

3066.14 --> 3078.5899999999997
as appealing as it could be to most

3069.56 --> 3082.16
other regions in the world currently I

3078.59 --> 3085.51
are for a moment ready that you said I

3082.16 --> 3090.83
watch paint dry but no paint pouring

3085.51 --> 3102.32
like where the paint drying videos on

3090.83 --> 3106.869
YouTube they gotta be there right yeah

3102.32 --> 3106.869
Karen B action painting I get it

3109.39 --> 3121.3399999999997
yes tell in 8012 I don't really get I

3112.99 --> 3124.3399999999997
don't really care about that is this

3121.34 --> 3125.38
discovered a new planet of course they

3124.34 --> 3128.81
have

3125.38 --> 3131.9300000000003
why isn't Jupiter is supposedly now

3128.81 --> 3134.06
having all these moons and it's just so

3131.93 --> 3136.6299999999997
over the place it's so all over the

3134.06 --> 3136.63
place now

3146.21 --> 3155.0
don't bring that stuff to my chat what

3150.27 --> 3155.0
solace miss don't

3161.1 --> 3165.18
don't get disgusting on me

3172.71 --> 3181.81
acrylic is fun okay paint no painting

3179.1 --> 3183.5499999999997
you know I have a couple of paper

3181.81 --> 3187.27
paintings it's not really worth

3183.55 --> 3193.3
mentioning and I had a painting phase -

3187.27 --> 3198.28
I kind of did it as a an art artists

3193.3 --> 3200.44
preparation for me going into the art

3198.28 --> 3202.5400000000004
schools in the direction of computers

3200.44 --> 3204.34
but yeah I got rejected twice and after

3202.54 --> 3214.69
that I just figured out like oh really

3204.34 --> 3219.06
well go screw you then yes I think that

3214.69 --> 3221.11
was probably one of the worst

3219.06 --> 3224.2599999999998
disappointments in my life because I

3221.11 --> 3226.9900000000002
really aimed at it I really wanted to

3224.26 --> 3231.19
become a computer game designer and

3226.99 --> 3236.2599999999998
conceptualize erm all that can I have

3231.19 --> 3240.31
the the visual acuity the spatial senses

3236.26 --> 3244.3900000000003
and they just rejected me because they

3240.31 --> 3249.22
were not I didn't fit fit their little

3244.39 --> 3251.44
program just didn't like me they just

3249.22 --> 3256.8399999999997
wanted people that would do exactly what

3251.44 --> 3258.82
they wanted them to do I think that's

3256.84 --> 3261.58
what I felt from it I didn't feel very

3258.82 --> 3274.21
welcome

3261.58 --> 3275.65
every time I went there yeah thank you

3274.21 --> 3277.36
by the way Amanda young for the ten

3275.65 --> 3283.51
dollars which a donation always

3277.36 --> 3285.67
appreciate your contributions hey Arwen

3283.51 --> 3288.7000000000003
please come keep your head up and keep

3285.67 --> 3292.4500000000003
up the good work with your show you're a

3288.7 --> 3296.3399999999997
good person good people don't quit God

3292.45 --> 3296.3399999999997
is with all the way

3300.579 --> 3310.119
yeah well I'm certainly feel like I'm

3303.819 --> 3312.67
being tested here it's interesting even

3310.119 --> 3315.339
though it wasn't yesterday with the day

3312.67 --> 3323.109
before he chats Rosen thank you for

3315.339 --> 3327.3089999999997
telling me no it's not it just moved but

3323.109 --> 3335.799
that's okay no but there is a delay in a

3327.309 --> 3339.099
chat though but yeah it was weird

3335.799 --> 3342.099
because a lot of people tell me and Owen

3339.099 --> 3346.9
Benjamin even said it because apparently

3342.099 --> 3348.4590000000003
he has some financial flexibility issues

3346.9 --> 3350.079
or something that's just I'm gonna

3348.459 --> 3351.8799999999997
designate isn't that that not in my

3350.079 --> 3354.449
position either by a long shot

3351.88 --> 3357.359
okay so I'm not comparing myself to him

3354.449 --> 3360.88
don't worry about it

3357.359 --> 3363.339
but even said like yeah financial issues

3360.88 --> 3366.1890000000003
to really worry and sacrifice to that

3363.339 --> 3368.2889999999998
it's usually turns out to be nonsense

3366.189 --> 3371.589
because if you just try to do the right

3368.289 --> 3373.3900000000003
thing then it'll always work out that's

3371.589 --> 3376.089
what he said that's kind of what I've

3373.39 --> 3378.0389999999998
experienced during my life but yeah I'm

3376.089 --> 3385.499
constantly being tested with it

3378.039 --> 3388.3900000000003
and also I am getting kind of sick

3385.499 --> 3391.859
feeling like I'm constantly being tested

3388.39 --> 3391.859
on that I'm kind of sick of it

3393.779 --> 3402.519
it's like getting on my deepest of

3396.97 --> 3406.5989999999997
nerves very slow building but it's

3402.519 --> 3408.91
building very slow I'm getting just sick

3406.599 --> 3415.4100000000003
of constantly feeling like I'm being

3408.91 --> 3415.41
tested on my survival financially Oh

3418.21 --> 3423.46
Thank You Julia Pavan for the $5 super

3421.18 --> 3425.5589999999997

3473.839 --> 3487.549
Thank You Man yeah that's about 33 that

3482.809 --> 3489.1090000000004
could work unfortunately but you don't

3487.549 --> 3492.89
worry about it it's just I'm pretty

3489.109 --> 3495.17
certain it's only gonna come in either

3492.89 --> 3498.89
if I'm really lucky tomorrow but

3495.17 --> 3502.759
probably Monday so I'm still gonna have

to find a way to survive the weekend but

3502.759 --> 3514.64
yes it will help thank you so much

3507.009 --> 3517.609
coz after the weekend it's like 20 21 20

3557.279 --> 3567.749
weekend though but I'll see if I can

3563.789 --> 3572.5490000000004

don't think I can and yeah that thank

3621.719 --> 3624.869
you again for the $5 super chat the

3623.309 --> 3630.079
nation's you live happened but the issue

3624.869 --> 3633.239
is with debit cards it's gonna cost and

3630.079 --> 3635.7290000000003
yeah what's gonna even have to be happen

3633.239 --> 3638.669
is me just thinking off finally I can

3635.729 --> 3642.6299999999997
fix it and then it's gonna slide all the

3638.669 --> 3645.589
way into the red so it's not a chronic

3642.63 --> 3648.509
solution really it's more like a

3645.589 --> 3649.98
desperate situation solution then maybe

3648.509 --> 3653.059
I could do that
