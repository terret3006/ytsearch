38.089 --> 46.44
good morning welcome to flatter the

42.0 --> 48.03
earlybird number 236 I'm your host

46.44 --> 49.68
Arwen and before we start the show

48.03 --> 55.409
please don't forget to share it on any

49.68 --> 56.76
platform you deem fit also if you

55.409 --> 58.559
haven't already subscribed to my channel

56.76 --> 59.909
and hit the bell notification so you

58.559 --> 61.049
know when I'm going live which is

59.909 --> 64.08
normally 2:00 p.m.

61.049 --> 66.75
Amsterdam time every day and please also

64.08 --> 70.92
support my show through the super chats

66.75 --> 73.14
paypal patreon and my GoFundMe and I

70.92 --> 78.119
already received before the show even

73.14 --> 83.759
started super chat the 299 Australian

78.119 --> 88.2
dollars from Trish bliss that decided to

83.759 --> 93.69
join my show because she hates John more

88.2 --> 97.289
than me so hey whatever's whatever it

93.69 --> 104.0
takes you know for you but yeah welcome

97.289 --> 104.0
I hope you enjoyed the weather today is

105.17 --> 113.219
yeah it was really nice and sunny but

109.799 --> 119.57900000000001
it's with cloudy right now the now it's

113.219 --> 122.24
still pretty warm and moist and lovely

119.579 --> 122.24
sunny day

122.86 --> 129.72899999999998
and the wind isn't it's nice it's not

125.55 --> 137.2
super cold it's not super hot it's just

129.729 --> 143.64000000000001
a nice mellow wind so you guys all doing

137.2 --> 152.17
I got Tamara coffee and an apple and tea

143.64 --> 160.86999999999998
and good old lemonade what a day

152.17 --> 162.95999999999998
yesterday Wow yeah yeah before I get

160.87 --> 168.19
over that let's see it was in chat

162.96 --> 171.36
because see Robin Mitchell was first in

168.19 --> 178.47
and then Hagrid well seems to be up for

171.36 --> 182.61
an active Cleary and then Trisha please

178.47 --> 190.93
drunk involved for one one son monkey 3d

182.61 --> 195.10000000000002
edge am is search a KO alley be to see

190.93 --> 198.43
you you didn't last Musk

195.1 --> 200.459
Brandon cook yeah I've got to see you

198.43 --> 200.459
guys

202.67 --> 207.30999999999997
yeah yesterday was a was a blast I

208.03 --> 214.19
didn't exactly went easy on the alcohol

210.83 --> 217.85000000000002
on myself but at least I didn't like

214.19 --> 219.92
cross drink and yeah I had a bottle of

217.85 --> 224.72
wine but I didn't didn't touch it like

219.92 --> 229.39999999999998
the beers were plenty and yeah I had a

224.72 --> 231.29
good time it was well it it was a bit

229.4 --> 234.05
tough because everybody was kind of

231.29 --> 236.42
anxious to get into battle but I was

234.05 --> 240.47
already telling and they knew like yeah

236.42 --> 243.41
this is basically a big stage piece

240.47 --> 246.53
that's what the stunt stuff is gonna

243.41 --> 249.32
happen and it did and I got pretty much

246.53 --> 252.07
2/3 of the entire thing so before any

249.32 --> 254.56
serious action breaks out and that's

252.07 --> 259.28
basically about to happen the next time

254.56 --> 265.15
like in the middle of a conference big

259.28 --> 265.15
Druitt leader of the Alpha bar gin I

266.47 --> 273.20000000000005
still have to figure out exactly the

268.91 --> 276.16900000000004
right reason as to why it has to have a

273.2 --> 278.45
really good reason and not just some

276.169 --> 280.34
superficial reason especially because

278.45 --> 286.669
they're in the middle of a war but it'll

280.34 --> 288.38
have something to do with yeah the elves

286.669 --> 290.57
are not doing all that great they are

288.38 --> 293.75
holding their ground but the orcs just

290.57 --> 295.84999999999997
keep coming there's so many of them in

293.75 --> 299.03
the Far West and it yeah they're all

295.85 --> 305.66
just migrating to become part of that

299.03 --> 308.51
war basically and so since the dwarves

305.66 --> 310.52000000000004
are getting kind of in the way by

308.51 --> 313.4
helping out the orcs just doing business

310.52 --> 315.79999999999995
with them the elves are pretty much

313.4 --> 319.789
other's Cold War status now with the

315.8 --> 322.40000000000003
dwarves again and since the settlement

319.789 --> 325.4
where the adventures are are basically a

322.4 --> 329.03
cooperation between humans from overseas

325.4 --> 329.87
and the dwarves yeah this is getting

329.03 --> 332.75
complicated

329.87 --> 335.06
so what he'll probably try to do is

332.75 --> 335.93
basically appeal to directly to the king

335.06 --> 339.5
to try and

335.93 --> 343.93
get an alliance but that's not the Kings

339.5 --> 343.93
plan well not at first anyway

344.889 --> 352.699
and then stuff will happen and yeah it's

350.33 --> 358.13
gonna mess everything up and basically

352.699 --> 362.63
allow the the quest to find gold off the

358.13 --> 366.38
great the mythical ancient gold mine to

362.63 --> 370.15
the west and for that yeah the whole

366.38 --> 372.259
issue the war has to be resolved and

370.15 --> 375.59
everybody has to have a good reason to

372.259 --> 377.63
get in there and what'll basically

375.59 --> 379.46
happen is that when yeah I'm spoiling

377.63 --> 381.86
this now but I know that my players are

379.46 --> 384.10999999999996
not watching my show because they're not

381.86 --> 386.3
they're kind of allergic to Flat Earth

384.11 --> 394.31
so that's my safe thing about it that

386.3 --> 398.449
basically do spoiler alerts yeah but

394.31 --> 401.449
yeah one of the adventures has a like a

398.449 --> 405.409
curse on him because of his own father

401.449 --> 409.97
that was a orc and he is a half elf half

405.409 --> 414.159
org and basically the Arch Druid of the

409.97 --> 417.199
elves the leader of them basically yeah

414.159 --> 421.4
punish them severely their village and

417.199 --> 426.83000000000004
that caused the orc to basically bind

421.4 --> 429.19899999999996
his soul demonically to a sword and yeah

426.83 --> 432.409
that source basically / it's only

429.199 --> 434.93
purpose is to attain to the destruction

432.409 --> 436.58
of the arch to it and the adventures

434.93 --> 440.63
have it in their possession they figured

436.58 --> 445.669
out what it is but for some reason this

440.63 --> 447.5
is still kept kind of secret in the

445.669 --> 449.389
sense that they had not everybody's

447.5 --> 451.07
figuring it out otherwise the arch truth

449.389 --> 453.07
would never come there for any reason

451.07 --> 456.289
it's too dangerous

453.07 --> 460.58
well you might overlook it because of

456.289 --> 461.57
the opportunity but as soon as he's

460.58 --> 463.699
going to show up

461.57 --> 466.159
yeah the swords gonna take over the

463.699 --> 467.90000000000003
wheel of that player doesn't

466.159 --> 469.49
particularly like the arch to it

467.9 --> 472.669
personally anyway

469.49 --> 475.039
and then sadly a titanic battle will

472.669 --> 478.13
burst out as the yes the spirit of his

475.039 --> 481.669
father will literally overtake him and

478.13 --> 483.68
he will literally transform into his

481.669 --> 486.08
yeah that for original physical

483.68 --> 491.599
manifestation literally turn into a

486.08 --> 493.00899999999996
giant orc and yeah that's gonna be

491.599 --> 494.539
interesting because that's gonna

493.009 --> 496.099
completely change around how

494.539 --> 497.539
everything's gonna work the elves will

496.099 --> 499.49
after that point have to basically

497.539 --> 504.259
retreat so yeah

499.49 --> 509.659
secure Ilana door the the lot Lorien of

504.259 --> 511.28000000000003
this realm and yeah the orcs are just

509.659 --> 514.25
gonna have free reign that'll eventually

511.28 --> 516.8299999999999
lead them to just start taking over the

514.25 --> 519.95
village for which the elves were pretty

516.83 --> 524.1800000000001
much in the way that the natural line of

519.95 --> 527.51
defense and that'll give the king since

524.18 --> 530.4799999999999
he now just gratified that village as a

527.51 --> 533.48
city of the kingdom and if it's going to

530.48 --> 536.24
be attacked then basically he could

533.48 --> 540.26
declare war on the orcs and really use

536.24 --> 542.42
that as a yes a colonization attempt to

540.26 --> 544.22
storm into the lands and try to reach

542.42 --> 547.01
gold earth which is pretty much in the

544.22 --> 549.649
middle of app presumed to be in the

547.01 --> 553.87
middle of orc territory so that is

549.649 --> 558.05
what's going on with my D&D campaign I

553.87 --> 562.49
wonder if you guys can follow what I'm

558.05 --> 568.91
trying to explain but it's pretty

562.49 --> 569.91
awesome to me yes flatout warrior I have

568.91 --> 571.23
been

569.91 --> 574.5899999999999
[Music]

571.23 --> 574.59
plenty of times

585.629 --> 591.009
but anyway yeah look what I basically

588.639 --> 592.869
described is like the framework the

591.009 --> 596.35
designers framework for what's gonna

592.869 --> 598.72
happen in that world and yeah there is

596.35 --> 601.089
my I probably should have just showed

598.72 --> 604.839
the map as I was explaining it that will

601.089 --> 605.23
clarify it a bit more maybe I can do

604.839 --> 608.1600000000001
that

605.23 --> 608.16
hold on

611.53 --> 617.73
but the cool thing is that as the

614.11 --> 619.96
adventures are basically the

617.73 --> 622.39
experiencers they are like the

619.96 --> 624.82
characters of a movie also it is they

622.39 --> 627.34
are the conductors through which the

624.82 --> 630.82
story of it all comes in

627.34 --> 632.77
they are the experiences and all of what

630.82 --> 636.49
they are doing and the story how it

632.77 --> 639.43
unfolds it's I'm gonna write it all down

636.49 --> 641.62
and I still know I have all the designs

639.43 --> 643.9599999999999
so I could absolutely elaborate it it

641.62 --> 647.59
could be eventually like a freaking

643.96 --> 653.89
fantasy movie series at it pretty

647.59 --> 656.11
interesting I think I don't know I'd

653.89 --> 659.92
love to try it out just like a short

656.11 --> 662.2
series go short maybe it'll be extremely

659.92 --> 665.7299999999999
long I don't know it all depends on how

662.2 --> 668.86
appealing it would be in its final form

665.73 --> 673.0500000000001
but before I get there before I even get

668.86 --> 673.0500000000001
to attempting that it's gonna take years

675.99 --> 683.79
anyway let me get back to that map

684.31 --> 695.069
campaign script [ __ ]

699.63 --> 702.65
that's the one

710.61 --> 724.1
ah wait how am I gonna present this let

721.23 --> 724.1
me see

733.14 --> 738.48
right and never tried that before wait

736.529 --> 743.07
I'll just do it the old-fashioned way

738.48 --> 744.72
ins and dump it in Skype then open it up

743.07 --> 747.6600000000001
there and then I can present that

744.72 --> 749.61
because yeah before I used to just use

747.66 --> 752.2199999999999
Google Hangouts and then present the

749.61 --> 752.85
viewer but since I don't use that

752.22 --> 755.72
anymore

752.85 --> 766.35
I don't have that function unfortunately

755.72 --> 772.19
so let's get that picture in there okay

766.35 --> 772.19
oh [ __ ] it's 20 megabytes

790.53 --> 802.0799999999999
oh come on Wow what damn it I thought

800.31 --> 805.05
I'd just dropped that picture there but

802.08 --> 809.69
I have to open it separately it refuses

805.05 --> 814.02
to actually show it that just sucks

809.69 --> 815.7
never mind the freaking map alright so

814.02 --> 821.6899999999999
let's get back to the show before it's

815.7 --> 821.69
just all waters down to nothing hmm

824.36 --> 831.39
before I went to the game I had a great

828.06 --> 833.4
talk with chocolate like in the back

831.39 --> 835.65
panel after the show had already ended

833.4 --> 838.26
because I went to get for some groceries

835.65 --> 839.6999999999999
and then when I got back yeah everybody

838.26 --> 845.7
was pretty much gone but chocolate was

839.7 --> 848.25
still in there and we talked about

845.7 --> 852.09
quantum mechanics for like at least half

848.25 --> 856.65
an hour and the funny thing was he

852.09 --> 859.32
explained a lot to me about how he

856.65 --> 861.4499999999999
learned things and that really sparked

859.32 --> 864.0600000000001
some memories because that what he

861.45 --> 867.2700000000001
explained is exactly what I had learned

864.06 --> 870.18
at as well but then I brought forth the

867.27 --> 872.16
question pieces that I have been

870.18 --> 877.17
typically with that and it's just like

872.16 --> 880.0799999999999
but what is it really they're doing like

877.17 --> 885.99
it's like sometimes I wonder if quantum

880.08 --> 891.75
mechanics shouldn't just be shouldn't

885.99 --> 896.52
just be called photo mechanics because

891.75 --> 899.73
it's mostly all based on contraptions

896.52 --> 902.73
and effects interactions of servation

899.73 --> 906.08
or like information interaction with

902.73 --> 909.24
lights that's really like electricity I

906.08 --> 915.99
haven't seen much of that really they're

909.24 --> 919.47
they presume that in the is it quantum

915.99 --> 922.33
processors know that

919.47 --> 925.0600000000001
that could be considered but it's more

922.33 --> 927.4300000000001
that's more like electro-mechanics like

925.06 --> 930.3699999999999
special electro-mechanics you could say

927.43 --> 933.54
and just the rest seems to be like photo

930.37 --> 936.46
mechanics and that's combined with

933.54 --> 939.0699999999999
presupposition arguments of particles

936.46 --> 942.1600000000001
moving speeds to become quantum

939.07 --> 945.6700000000001
mechanics and that's what I think that

942.16 --> 949.0
they've done and chocolates not outright

945.67 --> 951.4
agreeing with me but he does understand

949.0 --> 952.99
my suspicions and when I pointed out he

951.4 --> 956.74
does say like yeah that is kind of

952.99 --> 960.04
puzzling because I feel like it's an

956.74 --> 964.9
aberration I feel that like quantum

960.04 --> 966.6999999999999
mechanics has become a new layer a new

964.9 --> 968.97
gatekeeping layer for the rest of the

966.7 --> 968.97
information

973.72 --> 985.27
[Music]

987.96 --> 995.6800000000001
but yeah I'm not I'm not there yet

990.46 --> 998.46
although I had to bring forth it's like

995.68 --> 1001.3199999999999
yeah they'd arrive through their

998.46 --> 1003.27
mechanical systems through their optical

1001.32 --> 1008.94
mechanical systems with mirrors and all

1003.27 --> 1011.4
that stuff they derive these effects but

1008.94 --> 1014.58
then I keep on wondering where is the

1011.4 --> 1016.4399999999999
scientific method really there where is

1014.58 --> 1019.07
something actually being scientifically

1016.44 --> 1021.1400000000001
proven because the mechanics are there I

1019.07 --> 1024.0
get it

1021.14 --> 1026.309
you know it's trial and error basically

1024.0 --> 1029.99
yeah you figure out it works like this

1026.309 --> 1035.1499999999999
but where is the scientific method there

1029.99 --> 1035.15
to actually prove it

1040.14 --> 1046.92
and I also had it yeah before for that I

1044.22 --> 1051.99
also had a bit was it a guy that's

1046.92 --> 1056.16
always pestering John about a lot of

1051.99 --> 1060.9
things young I think or anyway yeah I

1056.16 --> 1063.51
asked him to like get on my get up early

1060.9 --> 1067.26
and yeah get on my panel let's talk

1063.51 --> 1073.049
about it over Skype but I don't see him

1067.26 --> 1075.419
marry yet what that would be interesting

1073.049 --> 1077.309
to do with some time because I do want

1075.419 --> 1080.88
to talk about quantum mechanics more

1077.309 --> 1083.85
about just get the material out in the

1080.88 --> 1086.22
open and just wade through it and just

1083.85 --> 1089.2199999999998
see what is going on there really what

1086.22 --> 1093.44
is it they're doing how are they

1089.22 --> 1093.44
arriving to the conclusions

1100.23 --> 1103.1
anyway

1109.68 --> 1119.55
oh cool well sir sir Chico surgical okay

1115.71 --> 1126.2
yep well if they come and arrest me for

1119.55 --> 1131.25
basically touching upon a piece of data

1126.2 --> 1135.27
yeah see a script that's not supposed to

1131.25 --> 1139.23
be questioned well that would give a lot

1135.27 --> 1144.53
of weight to my situation don't you

1139.23 --> 1150.84
think and besides I'm just a YouTube guy

1144.53 --> 1153.33
and how many can even get to the level

1150.84 --> 1156.51
where they can see how complicated

1153.33 --> 1161.3999999999999
quantum mechanics is because if it is a

1156.51 --> 1166.26
trick if it is like an aberration cover

1161.4 --> 1169.8300000000002
placed over a certain lure to deflect

1166.26 --> 1172.26
those that basically don't have the the

1169.83 --> 1178.29
mind to really understand that matter to

1172.26 --> 1181.29
keep them out then yeah who is actually

1178.29 --> 1183.48
gonna help me expose that for who's

1181.29 --> 1186.11
actually even capable of doing that this

1183.48 --> 1188.88
is complicated stuff it's on a new level

1186.11 --> 1192.02
it's not for the dumb quantum mechanics

1188.88 --> 1192.0200000000002
is not simple

1199.48 --> 1206.49
what

1201.51 --> 1212.7
hello Robyn Mitchell thanks for not

1206.49 --> 1215.82
spamming quantum is suspect yes Hannah

1212.7 --> 1218.01
bear indeed I find it suspicious but

1215.82 --> 1219.3
there is a lot of very interesting

1218.01 --> 1223.73
things about it

1219.3 --> 1228.4199999999998
and they may be dealing with real

1223.73 --> 1230.85
phenomena as it were but from what I get

1228.42 --> 1232.5
to see from the way they even test and

1230.85 --> 1234.8999999999999
demonstrated it is all derived from

1232.5 --> 1239.73
man-made devices pretty pretty

1234.9 --> 1244.23
persistently also that and look I don't

1239.73 --> 1247.5
even give a [ __ ] about that really but

1244.23 --> 1250.17
according to the fundamentalist approach

1247.5 --> 1254.28
of the scientific method according to

1250.17 --> 1258.3000000000002
John that shouldn't yeah that shouldn't

1254.28 --> 1261.86
work you know you can use mechanisms and

1258.3 --> 1266.37
man-made devices to measure certain data

1261.86 --> 1271.4099999999999
but the phenomena that the actual

1266.37 --> 1274.77
visible change should not be manifesting

1271.41 --> 1277.8000000000002
in a man-made device itself see and

1274.77 --> 1282.6
that's exactly what I think is kind of

1277.8 --> 1285.51
happening with these proof setups for

1282.6 --> 1287.6599999999999
the quantum mechanical effects see the

1285.51 --> 1287.66
issue

1301.45 --> 1304.409
it yeah

1304.91 --> 1308.38
so what do you do with that

1321.25 --> 1329.26
but yeah anyway I'd love to mmm

1325.62 --> 1333.2199999999998
Skype room there there's no Skype room

1329.26 --> 1335.83
Robyn Mitchell but I can call people on

1333.22 --> 1339.8500000000001
skype or they can attempt to call me I

1335.83 --> 1342.549
hopefully I'd see that but if you want

1339.85 --> 1345.61
to be on my panel during the show you

1342.549 --> 1347.86
first have to add me on skype and my

1345.61 --> 1350.2299999999998
skype address is pretty much the first

1347.86 --> 1357.07
thing you get to see in the description

1350.23 --> 1360.96
box below in YouTube so if you want to

1357.07 --> 1360.96
talk to me that you gotta add me

1377.58 --> 1381.6789999999999
and fundamentally deaths

1389.05 --> 1396.37
and then that's yeah that's not really

1392.29 --> 1401.85
proper language in fundamentalists maybe

1396.37 --> 1401.85
anti fundamentalist but

1407.22 --> 1414.18
30,000 particle colliders across the

1410.05 --> 1414.18
earth really okay

1422.149 --> 1427.2189999999998
all right well yeah that would be

1425.509 --> 1430.999
typical you know with CERN

1427.219 --> 1434.289
Oh God by the way there was this

1430.999 --> 1441.199
ridiculous weird sci-fi article today I

1434.289 --> 1445.549
still have it open it's so bizarre part

1441.199 --> 1448.5790000000002
mature part light new discovery hybrid

1445.549 --> 1452.889
particle opens doors to exciting new

1448.579 --> 1457.399
technology it's basically lights and

1452.889 --> 1465.1989999999998
they supposedly have tamed the light to

1457.399 --> 1472.879
behave like a part of it it's it's

1465.199 --> 1478.5990000000002
almost new age level sci-fi I'll present

1472.879 --> 1478.599
it it's so bizarre let's see

1487.76 --> 1490.36
yep

1493.4 --> 1496.15
right

1502.72 --> 1508.81
Goodin hackable quantum convene they

1505.69 --> 1511.3300000000002
just totally collude clear the

1508.81 --> 1515.32
colloquial eyes the [ __ ] out of the word

1511.33 --> 1521.9199999999998
quantum and it's expected to happen it's

1515.32 --> 1529.99
like the next futurist hype word now

1521.92 --> 1532.39
everything suddenly quantum it really

1529.99 --> 1535.8700000000001
just feels like a science fiction cover

1532.39 --> 1538.3300000000002
story for technology which they

1535.87 --> 1539.9799999999998
obviously don't really want to share how

1538.33 --> 1542.35
what's really going on because other

1539.98 --> 1545.98
people could then build it as well and

1542.35 --> 1547.81
compete with them so it only makes sense

1545.98 --> 1549.94
that they would make up new science

1547.81 --> 1552.61
fiction [ __ ] stories as for what to

1549.94 --> 1558.13
tell their technology is doing to cover

1552.61 --> 1562.3799999999999
for what's actually happening combined

1558.13 --> 1562.38
light and matter with our God

1566.13 --> 1572.8600000000001
okay they're called polariton apparently

1571.53 --> 1579.46
yep

1572.86 --> 1582.4599999999998
oh god I got a quote this known in

1579.46 --> 1584.53
scientific terminology as Polara tones

1582.46 --> 1590.6100000000001
these hybrid particles have been

1584.53 --> 1590.61
described as sort of magic dust

1594.21 --> 1601.03
they have qualities of both atomic and

1597.94 --> 1611.8600000000001
light particles which allowed them to

1601.03 --> 1619.32
move quickly through space just like

1611.86 --> 1619.32
really seems slightly presuppositional

1626.04 --> 1635.6599999999999
it's just all right so that's happening

1632.7 --> 1635.66
apparently

1641.779 --> 1643.779
ah

1658.409 --> 1670.8600000000001
behave like a photon a light particle

1663.98 --> 1673.47
and matter so what if you just take away

1670.86 --> 1676.2299999999998
the presupposition that that particle

1673.47 --> 1678.8990000000001
has a that that is what photons is and

1676.23 --> 1681.509
then try to reconfigure what they're

1678.899 --> 1691.9399999999998
trying to do sounds very much like

1681.509 --> 1695.58
they're just maybe like miniaturize a

1691.94 --> 1697.8300000000002
crystal which can capture lights

1695.58 --> 1701.33
something like I don't know they they

1697.83 --> 1703.4399999999998
didn't even get into any physical

1701.33 --> 1705.72
representation it was basically just a

1703.44 --> 1707.669
story all of it like oh this is what

1705.72 --> 1710.7
it's supposed to be doing not actually

1707.669 --> 1713.759
mentioning okay this is the this is

1710.7 --> 1716.789
what's happening that is what it's doing

1713.759 --> 1720.529
no it's just it I don't know it's just

1716.789 --> 1720.529
all science fiction to me at this point

1733.71 --> 1740.25
yeah by the way hello chocolate

1735.72 --> 1746.91
chocolate saying yeah I did get to see a

1740.25 --> 1748.62
lot of your your yeah you being a guest

1746.91 --> 1753.6000000000001
on iron row media yes they're always

1748.62 --> 1759.36
really awesome having you there and good

1753.6 --> 1763.79
story and good backstory getting all

1759.36 --> 1763.79
into 911 and all that back again

1781.029 --> 1787.679
yeah it was cool it was a joy to listen

1784.839 --> 1787.6789999999999
to the whole thing

1790.92 --> 1793.949
[Music]

1802.69 --> 1808.779
yeah and also just realizing that

1805.69 --> 1811.929
chocolates pretty pretty much been in

1808.779 --> 1817.33
chat and talking on the flat earth

1811.929 --> 1820.69
debates and then appearing on that show

1817.33 --> 1823.83
he's been added all day so the guys got

1820.69 --> 1823.8300000000002
some stamina

1824.05 --> 1827.1499999999999
[Music]

1837.16 --> 1841.8600000000001
yeah the whole certain thing

1868.63 --> 1880.659
okay yeah I'm just gonna eat this Apple

1873.799 --> 1880.6589999999999
here I'm growing a bit silent here

1889.28 --> 1892.329
[Music]

1895.94 --> 1899.13
[Music]

1900.96 --> 1905.82
hey if you guys want to get on here and

1903.03 --> 1908.66
just have a panel talk with each other

1905.82 --> 1914.01
you know I'm up for it is Saturday so

1908.66 --> 1920.25
yeah I've no reason to cut cut the show

1914.01 --> 1924.33
at 3:00 p.m. so damn time so if you guys

1920.25 --> 1930.14
want to get on here and and I have a

1924.33 --> 1930.1399999999999
talk I'll call you up on skype

1943.64 --> 1946.48
hmm

1946.7 --> 1952.43
Robin Mitchell I have no idea what

1948.53 --> 1956.81
you're talking about where did you send

1952.43 --> 1959.23
it did you send it to my to my email or

1956.81 --> 1959.23
something

1969.57 --> 1972.59
I don't see it

1976.7 --> 1991.88
i I I don't see are you sure you typed

1980.72 --> 1997.55
in the right name it's our our win7 with

1991.88 --> 2000.8700000000001
a why not IJ so because I didn't don't

1997.55 --> 2000.87
see you having added me

2044.6 --> 2047.4399999999998
hmm

2071.2 --> 2073.77
ha

2075.109 --> 2084.0389999999998
that's nice and fresh outside hey I see

2078.739 --> 2084.039
you now all right

2087.15 --> 2090.61
[Music]

2101.92 --> 2104.9590000000003
[Music]

2112.98 --> 2121.71
so Robin you wanna call or hmm what's

2119.5 --> 2121.71
this

2138.97 --> 2141.97
okay

2161.57 --> 2166.1800000000003
right okay that's an interesting picture

2181.96 --> 2187.2200000000003
okay interesting some biblical angle to

2185.72 --> 2195.91
to this stuff

2187.22 --> 2195.91
yeah I wouldn't be surprised

2205.41 --> 2214.8799999999997
so yeah you wanna call and talk about

2208.8 --> 2218.54
this Robin

2214.88 --> 2218.54
because I'll call you

2227.25 --> 2232.67
you

2229.41 --> 2232.67
piss off [ __ ]

2239.33 --> 2244.639
[Music]

2282.23 --> 2292.78
hmm hey Constance long time no see are

2290.329 --> 2292.78
you doing

2305.83 --> 2316.92
[Music]

2311.51 --> 2321.38
hello how's it going on Adam good

2316.92 --> 2323.76
well no I'm get you in screen AE

2321.38 --> 2328.02
pleasure to talk to you by the way it's

2323.76 --> 2330.75
been an honor thank you for awhile you

2328.02 --> 2332.04
seem to come at this from the same sort

2330.75 --> 2333.24
of an angle that I've been listening to

2332.04 --> 2338.609
you especially when you were talking

2333.24 --> 2341.1899999999996
about the Sun what we think it is it's

2338.609 --> 2343.65
really an individual experience was

2341.19 --> 2347.579
having with it no one's having the same

2343.65 --> 2349.4100000000003
view on the Sun yeah totally I totally

2347.579 --> 2351.869
agree it's interesting you you see it

2349.41 --> 2355.47
like that as well every time I see it

2351.869 --> 2357.839
it's it's really just like a almost like

2355.47 --> 2360.6189999999997
a lens flare that's just perpetually

2357.839 --> 2364.0499999999997
there we know that light is invisible

2360.619 --> 2367.079
what we're seeing is what a light has

2364.05 --> 2370.9500000000003
hit it's a mirror ball and it's not even

2367.079 --> 2374.01
in our space it's just you know you look

2370.95 --> 2377.8799999999997
at glass and it you see a reflection of

2374.01 --> 2380.19
something white that's we're seeing the

2377.88 --> 2383.46
Sun and the moon in the sky but that's

2380.19 --> 2387.329
an important thanks huh what a move well

2383.46 --> 2389.2200000000003
you think it's a reflection yeah because

2387.329 --> 2398.849
look at the moon that's why it's like

2389.22 --> 2401.0989999999997
see-through yeah but okay but but I I

2398.849 --> 2403.38
get that absolutely I look I think that

2401.099 --> 2406.53
all of the heavenly bodies are purely

2403.38 --> 2408.3
light based but if you say okay it's a

2406.53 --> 2410.9100000000003
reflection like on a piece of glass

2408.3 --> 2413.4900000000002
that's suggesting that that makes it

2410.91 --> 2416.069
kind of local so what is that reflecting

2413.49 --> 2421.0789999999997
on because I don't think I think it may

2416.069 --> 2423.75
be basically like it just naturally

2421.079 --> 2428.4
manifests there like a natural hologram

2423.75 --> 2429.27
thing yeah in a way the ball that it's

2428.4 --> 2435.52
in the circle

2429.27 --> 2439.09
the light is images into the space yes

2435.52 --> 2441.28
from outside notice season yeah no and

2439.09 --> 2444.61
it's important he said I really wanted

2441.28 --> 2447.7900000000004
to call you is because platter is so

2444.61 --> 2449.32
close they just stopped that flutter

2447.79 --> 2452.23
they stopped at the shape and the shape

2449.32 --> 2454.15
is just but one near aspect of what

2452.23 --> 2457.09
component has changed in the cause and

2454.15 --> 2460.2400000000002
the great cosmos but it's why you know

2457.09 --> 2462.58
it's pseudoscience why did he do it and

2460.24 --> 2465.0099999999998
then you find out he's messed up with

2462.58 --> 2468.04
the calendar too that's why I put that

2465.01 --> 2469.2700000000004
little piece of a little post-it they're

2468.04 --> 2473.14
both breaking it down

2469.27 --> 2476.41
it's Oh mankind being lost in space and

2473.14 --> 2478.45
time you see Flat Earth is just lost in

2476.41 --> 2480.04
time right now it's figured out the

2478.45 --> 2482.3199999999997
space you know I'm gonna argue about the

2480.04 --> 2486.2799999999997
map and all that jazz but they get it

2482.32 --> 2488.29
it's flat it's unmoving mm-hmm they got

2486.28 --> 2493.42
the space you don't have the time

2488.29 --> 2496.9
component and why you see I was asked by

2493.42 --> 2500.619
that jesuit order to change the calendar

2496.9 --> 2506.05
he said hmm I have used the cosmos first

2500.619 --> 2509.8
then you'll have your calendar solar

2506.05 --> 2513.52
days attached to moon day Sunday you

2509.8 --> 2515.59
know all that jab right you see the

2513.52 --> 2518.98
connection and it and its handiwork in

2515.59 --> 2521.4700000000003
them and the reason Vatican this is

2518.98 --> 2523.09
crime scene this isn't science and all

2521.47 --> 2526.0299999999997
the scientific look at something that

2523.09 --> 2528.07
isn't science he's a client you need to

2526.03 --> 2531.07
look at with the tech device what is the

2528.07 --> 2533.8590000000004
motive is it can't screen 53 million

2531.07 --> 2535.6000000000004
dollars a the Copernicus because he

2533.859 --> 2540.48
didn't make that he wanted to go to his

2535.6 --> 2540.48
death without saying what

2542.559 --> 2548.15
vatican is the key why would they be

2545.779 --> 2550.549
motivated to change because when they

2548.15 --> 2552.349
look at this is what I suspect some

2550.549 --> 2553.69
research information control isn't it

2552.349 --> 2557.3900000000003
always

2553.69 --> 2560.239
but what would they try to stop the

2557.39 --> 2565.029
number one enemy is the word of God to

2560.239 --> 2570.4990000000003
the Catholic organization revelation 12

2565.029 --> 2572.42
is a astronomical component and the time

2570.499 --> 2575.8089999999997
as there's an 8-count

2572.42 --> 2577.9990000000003
there's astronomical signs in them so

2575.809 --> 2580.849
Copernicus was trying to get mad

2577.999 --> 2583.029
distant on the Stars that he would

2580.849 --> 2585.259
disconnect and I managed to travel

2583.029 --> 2587.749
following the Stars now they can't read

2585.259 --> 2590.17
me back they don't know what Virgo looks

2587.749 --> 2593.2389999999996
like in Revelation 12 piece about

2590.17 --> 2595.759
astronomical science plus calendar count

2593.239 --> 2598.489
so at a counter if you don't have the

2595.759 --> 2598.97
right calendar that day junk makes no

2598.489 --> 2602.69
sense

2598.97 --> 2606.6499999999996
this is 1260 days and it's three and a

2602.69 --> 2609.17
half years you do the math that's 368

2606.65 --> 2612.049
years that's your clue that we have to

2609.17 --> 2615.109
move to the before know what pre-flood

2612.049 --> 2618.049
calendar you see the email calendar was

2615.109 --> 2619.779
prophetic or his grandson Noah he was

2618.049 --> 2625.609
telling know what the flood is coming

2619.779 --> 2628.009
okay right so you're saying that there's

2625.609 --> 2632.39
an older calendar basically three and a

2628.009 --> 2636.739
half years long Rob what we know has to

2632.39 --> 2639.259
be years roughly sort of you see there's

2636.739 --> 2641.569
two biblical pounders 1 a 3 flood and

2639.259 --> 2643.609
one is post flood Jesus says when you're

2641.569 --> 2646.819
in tribulation time you know has in the

2643.609 --> 2649.369
ease of Noah tell me those calendar

2646.819 --> 2653.48
that's 360 which is easily tappable

2649.369 --> 2656.63
there's the KJV and some flood water

2653.48 --> 2658.39
it's easy to deduce he's using a 360 a

2656.63 --> 2661.84
talent

2658.39 --> 2665.2
the reason it's okie is we have my

2661.84 --> 2669.52
calendar the day count is easy to figure

2665.2 --> 2670.24
out and the timing of exactly when Jesus

2669.52 --> 2672.82
is coming

2670.24 --> 2674.7999999999997
you know about having a right calendar

2672.82 --> 2676.27
and the great ability to read

2674.8 --> 2680.29
astronomical signs

2676.27 --> 2684.54
that's the Wiseman did and they only had

2680.29 --> 2688.96
all tested to find Jesus using the Stars

2684.54 --> 2690.07
our hagun honey when you have the start

2688.96 --> 2693.13
the ability to read the stars so

2690.07 --> 2700.53
Revelation 12 says I look at the heavens

2693.13 --> 2703.27
and there's a woman in the sky ergo

2700.53 --> 2708.01
anyone who's connected the Stars knows

2703.27 --> 2712.5099999999998
that's exactly any tells you that well

2708.01 --> 2715.8300000000004
you know all stars overhead Sun holding

2712.51 --> 2721.71
her and meet the feet this is an

2715.83 --> 2726.43
astronomical event the second one I

2721.71 --> 2728.2
didn't find the person just stayed stuff

2726.43 --> 2728.77
like a lot butter it just stuck on a

2728.2 --> 2731.74
shape

2728.77 --> 2734.98
you didn't go past his assuming more

2731.74 --> 2737.95
sizes there's two what he found was the

2734.98 --> 2740.92
priests on it's the sign of comfort was

2737.95 --> 2743.5299999999997
called the neck sign he finds is when

2740.92 --> 2747.81
the dragon it cast up that's me that a

2743.53 --> 2751.57
cap happens what did the draggled sign

2747.81 --> 2753.4
Draco's the drake graduation and if you

2751.57 --> 2757.42
will find that the Draco's constellation

2753.4 --> 2760.21
has a drake in it shower once you find

2757.42 --> 2762.67
the sign of hurt and the kickoff point

2760.21 --> 2766.09
from the Drake in the shower you can

2762.67 --> 2766.89
easily figure out exactly when Jesus is

2766.09 --> 2770.29
coming

2766.89 --> 2773.5899999999997
that's the whole purpose tourniquets was

2770.29 --> 2779.44
entangled with Vatican just stop us from

2773.59 --> 2781.4500000000003
figuring out exact time it's okay now

2779.44 --> 2785.86
like Christians will tell you oh no man

2781.45 --> 2790.0
knows the day or the hour only not I my

2785.86 --> 2793.54
father no that's the joke he is the

2790.0 --> 2794.77
father and there is no day and there is

2793.54 --> 2798.04
no power

2794.77 --> 2800.95
he's coming like a thief in the night

2798.04 --> 2803.83
there's no a and there is no hour

2800.95 --> 2806.41
because on that night he won't take it

2803.83 --> 2809.17
out that's why he pulled Peter when he

2806.41 --> 2813.1499999999996
went away and came not to find them

2809.17 --> 2818.25
sleeping goodnight but one hour okay see

2813.15 --> 2818.25
this is the whole reason we can deduce

2822.15 --> 2829.2400000000002
alright so well if you if you're

2826.42 --> 2833.6800000000003
claiming weekend you can when is that

2829.24 --> 2836.9199999999996
and then according to you April 4th 2021

2833.68 --> 2840.19
at 6 p.m. Jerusalem time because all of

2836.92 --> 2846.46
those New Jerusalem and 6 o'clock is the

2840.19 --> 2849.01
start of a new day in oh ok so do you

2846.46 --> 2853.33
think that the coming back of Jesus is

2849.01 --> 2858.4500000000003
then also purely a celestial event or is

2853.33 --> 2866.56
it actually a personified manifestation

2858.45 --> 2868.5699999999997
you will see celestial event but is it a

2866.56 --> 2874.81
celestial event of orissa the actual

2868.57 --> 2876.0
physical visiting what do you think okay

2874.81 --> 2878.5299999999997
interesting

2876.0 --> 2879.81
this person there's the whole first

2878.53 --> 2885.1000000000004
resurrection

2879.81 --> 2886.66
ok so your time with the light no circle

2885.1 --> 2889.66
because Jesus is the light of the world

2886.66 --> 2892.21
when he died on the cross he didn't die

2889.66 --> 2893.3799999999997
because the lights there existed right

2892.21 --> 2896.35
so that was the proof that you didn't

2893.38 --> 2901.23
kill God this is like the world so where

2896.35 --> 2903.18
is that light that light is reflecting

2901.23 --> 2905.549
it's shooting it's like and that's

2903.18 --> 2910.89
hitting the Sun wherever that Sun thing

2905.549 --> 2913.559
is it is at the North Pole the light of

2910.89 --> 2916.64
the world dreaming you think that sorry

2913.559 --> 2919.799
this one you had rora borealis there

2916.64 --> 2921.5989999999997
that's why you had that light phenomenon

2919.799 --> 2923.7599999999998
there okay

2921.599 --> 2925.619
that's what how earthers have discovered

2923.76 --> 2928.23
they knew there was another it was

2925.619 --> 2930.119
another son but right they don't

2928.23 --> 2932.819
understand it's invisible to us because

2930.119 --> 2936.27
we do not see God we don't have eyes

2932.819 --> 2942.5299999999997
anymore that's why we won't see light

2936.27 --> 2942.53
until it hits something I can't present

2942.829 --> 2950.78
the corrupted blood Satan sees in us and

2947.13 --> 2954.359
so he told Noah dude you're the last man

2950.78 --> 2956.0400000000004
have all flesh is corrupted what he was

2954.359 --> 2959.3289999999997
telling Noah there you know what new

2956.04 --> 2961.77
it's good his wife was machining blood

2959.329 --> 2962.4300000000003
she was a Canaanite that's what he's

2961.77 --> 2964.619
telling Noah

2962.43 --> 2967.29
she no longer strive because I'm like

2964.619 --> 2971.6400000000003
you know what happened to a candle right

2967.29 --> 2975.299
it destroys he couldn't strive with man

2971.64 --> 2978.5
anymore huh that had disappeared to save

2975.299 --> 2981.359
us and that's why he gave us a pod he

2978.5 --> 2986.0
was corrupted and that's the whole

2981.359 --> 2990.17
sacrifice both her its parabolic its

2986.0 --> 3000.71
spiritual its network is also Mitchell

2990.17 --> 3003.53
giving this body also matter needs to

3000.71 --> 3009.109
wake up because time is short and you

3003.53 --> 3012.2000000000003
have to get ready thing already

3009.109 --> 3013.97
yeah but for what exactly because there

3012.2 --> 3016.8799999999997
are some people in Flat Earth that are

3013.97 --> 3018.6189999999997
just never going to be that they are

3016.88 --> 3021.38
never going to step away from atheism

3018.619 --> 3023.4500000000003
and they'll take they'll discard the

3021.38 --> 3025.4900000000002
globe but they'll latch on to the other

3023.45 --> 3028.22
things you know everybody picks and

3025.49 --> 3029.99
choose their own pitfalls it's the it's

3028.22 --> 3032.3289999999997
the corruption it's the human nature you

3029.99 --> 3033.9199999999996
have to your ego has to latch onto

3032.329 --> 3037.279
something

3033.92 --> 3039.799
just happens I mean everyone has a

3037.279 --> 3044.15
belief right but the thing is all police

3039.799 --> 3045.859
must be founded on something at home if

3044.15 --> 3050.15
you're a believer or not you've probably

3045.859 --> 3053.029
on reason and common sense right the

3050.15 --> 3055.819
frequency just the recognition of the

3053.029 --> 3059.779
energies what they do what actions do

3055.819 --> 3062.779
what atmosphere spirit all that does as

3059.779 --> 3065.119
a just like chemistry but in the

3062.779 --> 3068.299
spiritual and that's what I do and just

3065.119 --> 3072.049
try to be as good and pure and honest as

3068.299 --> 3074.989
I can and use that to basically open up

3072.049 --> 3076.43
doors that others would naturally refuse

3074.989 --> 3079.489
because they're more concerned with

3076.43 --> 3082.69
keeping everything under control this is

3079.489 --> 3086.63
true but those laws that keep being

3082.69 --> 3089.89
ready for April 1st now you know the

3086.63 --> 3094.1600000000003
mystery I'm gonna spring name so first

3089.89 --> 3097.4
Fool's Day the story is about the

3094.16 --> 3101.509
virgins and his eyes virgins versus the

3097.4 --> 3103.579
foolish virgins now come he says he's

3101.509 --> 3108.109
gonna be three days in the heart of the

3103.579 --> 3110.69
earth before he writes right and he's

3108.109 --> 3116.499
just three days of darkness that we will

3110.69 --> 3119.93
be in that one star like goes in earth

3116.499 --> 3130.549
the three days of darkness oh yeah I've

3119.93 --> 3135.44
seen that in my visions that's Jesus dry

3130.549 --> 3137.269
days right spies yeah Bennett like the

3135.44 --> 3139.19
media is gonna go apeshit in that moment

3137.269 --> 3140.8689999999997
and everybody's gonna be all pointing

3139.19 --> 3143.15
fingers and like oh there's somebody

3140.869 --> 3144.7690000000002
secretly hiding the Sun and [ __ ] that's

3143.15 --> 3148.2490000000003
gonna be all over the media when that

3144.769 --> 3152.979
happens it's crazy it's worse than that

3148.249 --> 3152.979
because the devil must be like Jesus

3155.57 --> 3162.86
Jerusalem before Jesus I tell he will

3158.78 --> 3168.1400000000003
set up his own darkness he will put us

3162.86 --> 3176.75
in the world if do not fall for the

3168.14 --> 3178.97
first night he's gonna know I'm I don't

3176.75 --> 3183.17
care what happens I'm only going by the

3178.97 --> 3185.54
frequency of the actions so whatever so

3183.17 --> 3188.3
like as soon as there is some kind of

3185.54 --> 3191.18
figure that's basically gonna decide

3188.3 --> 3194.4700000000003
over life and death then you know it's

3191.18 --> 3196.94
wrong that's that's when you know

3194.47 --> 3199.16
yeah because Jesus would never do

3196.94 --> 3199.61
anything that frequency would never do

3199.16 --> 3202.8799999999997
that

3199.61 --> 3206.09
it wouldn't basically say no it would

3202.88 --> 3209.57
say halt and then the person might tend

3206.09 --> 3212.6200000000003
to then destroy themselves that is the

3209.57 --> 3216.77
that is the energy of Jesus and not a

3212.62 --> 3235.49
judge jury executioner type figure so

3216.77 --> 3238.73
that is how we recognize that's how you

3235.49 --> 3241.3399999999997
think that Jesus is gonna do that he's

3238.73 --> 3244.13
gonna sit on a throne and start

3241.34 --> 3247.8700000000003
prosecuting leading prosecutions you

3244.13 --> 3247.87
think that Jesus will do that

3285.8 --> 3346.1000000000004
oh great feast must have your oil it's

3329.0 --> 3357.8
not a metaphor it is far more like be in

3346.1 --> 3377.48
the night this is when the lighters will

3357.8 --> 3379.9700000000003
come it's not ok all right well yeah

3377.48 --> 3381.89
yeah I have to be frank here and that is

3379.97 --> 3386.87
that you are kind of like overwhelming

3381.89 --> 3387.2599999999998
me with all of this are you sure there

3386.87 --> 3389.0899999999997
is

3387.26 --> 3391.94
look I've hurt so many things that this

3389.09 --> 3395.9300000000003
is the first time anything specific like

3391.94 --> 3397.76
this I just I don't know I I don't get

3395.93 --> 3400.2799999999997
this wet it would like what is this

3397.76 --> 3401.9
wedding supposed to be like why would I

3400.28 --> 3405.4100000000003
even want to go there what is so

3401.9 --> 3406.9900000000002
important about that it defines the

3405.41 --> 3410.02
relationship

3406.99 --> 3415.0
have asthma and when he wanted he wants

3410.02 --> 3417.369
the Nazis ahead and because he comes

3415.0 --> 3420.7
from my body he wants let's look at our

3417.369 --> 3424.2400000000002
why that's fine I get that I get

3420.7 --> 3430.99
marriage okay but I don't like this

3424.24 --> 3486.49
specific event that involves himself why

3430.99 --> 3496.75
is this important what is its Mystery

3486.49 --> 3500.6189999999997
Babylon yeah I know that I am 23

3496.75 --> 3503.68
nineteen point money and God's wrath

3500.619 --> 3508.3
start then his Congress people and it's

3503.68 --> 3512.109
seven months at work April 4th and it's

3508.3 --> 3515.26
all linked to the Stars you can see it

3512.109 --> 3517.45
watch the video it takes an astronomy

3515.26 --> 3522.0400000000004
program and show you this the Star

3517.45 --> 3525.1099999999997
Alliance okay it's do the G that's what

3522.04 --> 3529.0099999999998
the product this is hiding from

3525.11 --> 3532.04
I'm all in a pack that's what I want

3529.01 --> 3532.67
ladder can move on from looking for the

3532.04 --> 3540.94
truth

3532.67 --> 3544.25
not the shape that's white now's okay

3540.94 --> 3546.8
but just realize that this is quite even

3544.25 --> 3550.16
for a Christian perspective this is

3546.8 --> 3551.9900000000002
quite a fantastical claim on what is

3550.16 --> 3554.75
specifically gonna happen in the Bible's

3551.99 --> 3557.93
in in the area where there if it has

3554.75 --> 3559.61
been disputed so incredibly widely so I

3557.93 --> 3561.5
find it very interesting that you have

3559.61 --> 3563.2400000000002
seemed to be having such a solid

3561.5 --> 3568.55
conclusion in all this and I will be

3563.24 --> 3571.4599999999996
looking out and but on the other hand

3568.55 --> 3574.4
like I look yeah Jesus may come I'll let

3571.46 --> 3576.77
that let that let the wicked be judged

3574.4 --> 3579.59
I totally go with that and then I'm

3576.77 --> 3581.78
gonna be trembling because I hope like

3579.59 --> 3585.1400000000003
oh [ __ ] I've been through some dark

3581.78 --> 3587.3900000000003
stuff I hope I don't get any like

3585.14 --> 3588.71
serious punishment for what I've been

3587.39 --> 3591.2799999999997
through that I don't even remember

3588.71 --> 3593.7200000000003
anymore because Jesus will know it all

3591.28 --> 3596.84
even that we just concealed from my own

3593.72 --> 3599.9599999999996
conscience and I'm just let me why would

3596.84 --> 3603.2000000000003
I go anywhere but my own home during

3599.96 --> 3605.41
this period I'll be prepared for three

3603.2 --> 3610.2999999999997
day darkness and have some food

3605.41 --> 3645.22
potentially stored don't need you can't

3610.3 --> 3651.29
why not or what so I know how crazy

3645.22 --> 3652.77
saying is and world the last thing I

3651.29 --> 3657.06
ever wanted

3652.77 --> 3660.119
I'll tell you this for now believe it

3657.06 --> 3664.71
it's just a crazy guy because there are

3660.119 --> 3667.38
warning signs that you will look I have

3664.71 --> 3669.69
seen some [ __ ] they'll turn you white

3667.38 --> 3672.84
now but for real like I've seen dark

3669.69 --> 3675.39
world stuff that just literally reflects

3672.84 --> 3678.03
aspects of what you're saying and has in

3675.39 --> 3679.89
the past that I can't really put into a

3678.03 --> 3682.2000000000003
wider framework because to me it's

3679.89 --> 3684.8689999999997
basically clips out of a movie I went

3682.2 --> 3687.18
through that basically plays out in the

3684.869 --> 3690.869
future which is very burdening to this

3687.18 --> 3691.35
very soul so but yeah three days of

3690.869 --> 3695.07
darkness

3691.35 --> 3697.5
yeah they quite literally have a memory

3695.07 --> 3702.05
of that that basically came to me since

3697.5 --> 3706.38
2011 when when I experienced that part

3702.05 --> 3710.4900000000002
specifically but the it could be that

3706.38 --> 3713.61
indeed this fasting thing will be a

3710.49 --> 3717.0299999999997
thing but I think that if it's really

3713.61 --> 3720.2000000000003
important we'll know it's like it's go

3717.03 --> 3724.3500000000004
just going to be told to us in our heads

3720.2 --> 3727.71
it'll be announced don't you think so

3724.35 --> 3781.67
that it'll be just told to you from the

3727.71 --> 3781.67
inside or to read that is pardon

3781.85 --> 3789.65
he when I found my calendar Enoch

3785.21 --> 3794.45
everything started thanks then the

3789.65 --> 3797.12
reason is timing

3794.45 --> 3802.0299999999997
all the characters into place you can

3797.12 --> 3805.5499999999997
see who's what one only that that is

3802.03 --> 3812.57
dependent people believing that Jesus is

3805.55 --> 3817.48
the father he is leave it in that line

3812.57 --> 3817.48
no man knows the earlier will not stop

3822.97 --> 3831.89
that's why the Jews really God he was

3829.34 --> 3834.56
clear the Son of God is God they knew

3831.89 --> 3837.62
that that's what they were proof you

3834.56 --> 3842.72
can't claim to be God flash so there's

3837.62 --> 3846.47
no argument Jews back then he's got an

3842.72 --> 3854.5699999999997
at mine is the last blocker you pass

3846.47 --> 3857.12
that line revelations possible okay well

3854.57 --> 3862.13
I presume that by the way my volume is

3857.12 --> 3867.5
extremely eyes for some reason yeah I

3862.13 --> 3871.25
think that if there was like a physical

3867.5 --> 3876.32
manifestation of God presence in the

3871.25 --> 3878.24
form of Jesus or yeah his return I think

3876.32 --> 3881.0
it would be just obvious by the

3878.24 --> 3884.0899999999997
frequency and like if he is the creator

3881.0 --> 3890.81
the designer that will our very creation

3884.09 --> 3894.6200000000003
will simply resonate with him as a as a

3890.81 --> 3897.5
pet with its owner or as a program with

3894.62 --> 3901.25
its programmer so I think they'll and I

3897.5 --> 3904.1
am a pure that's one of my tasks to stay

3901.25 --> 3908.03
pure to stay honest to do it right to

3904.1 --> 3911.21
take the risk of being pure in the face

3908.03 --> 3913.28
of a world that constantly pushes you to

3911.21 --> 3915.29
corrupt and to not do that to do exactly

3913.28 --> 3917.69
and by that skill

3915.29 --> 3920.15
that I have I hope to recognize the

3917.69 --> 3924.92
truth when it really is a life in that

3920.15 --> 3927.86
situation and recognize a new Pretender

3924.92 --> 3931.4900000000002
devil from the actual frequency of of

3927.86 --> 3937.01
the the creator that's why the creator

3931.49 --> 3939.8599999999997
wrote this entire game in stars we can't

3937.01 --> 3942.9500000000003
touch them that's what it my phone set

3939.86 --> 3946.21
yeah okay so basically you're saying

3942.95 --> 3949.3399999999997
it's like a secondary translation is

3946.21 --> 3952.13
imprinted within time itself through the

3949.34 --> 3954.8900000000003
stars it's like an extra could go with

3952.13 --> 3957.11
that I could definitely don't close it

3954.89 --> 3959.0499999999997
no but no but I already feel that is

3957.11 --> 3962.15
true I don't know the complete

3959.05 --> 3964.3100000000004
implications of it yet but I do feel it

3962.15 --> 3967.64
that that that's already there there's

3964.31 --> 3970.22
already stuff that I've seen that

3967.64 --> 3970.7599999999998
reflects that oh by the way I need to

3970.22 --> 3976.22
thank

3970.76 --> 3977.9900000000002
Trish Blythe again for another a $2.99

3976.22 --> 3980.0299999999997
Australian dollar super chat donation

3977.99 --> 3983.0899999999997
bless you our win no bless you - thank

3980.03 --> 3985.55
you so much let's see if you brother my

3983.09 --> 3986.9900000000002
only percent I'm gonna take off here I

3985.55 --> 3989.59
just wanted you to take a look at that

3986.99 --> 3991.4599999999996
messaging because you guys are such a

3989.59 --> 3993.77
fulcrum for this movement

3991.46 --> 3995.69
it was amazing if you could just take a

3993.77 --> 4000.04
look at it and you know verify one way

3995.69 --> 4004.66
or the other well do that it feels risky

4000.04 --> 4007.45
like there's something very interesting

4004.66 --> 4009.7
and I wonder yeah look we've been

4007.45 --> 4011.0499999999997
confronted with so many oh my god the

4009.7 --> 4013.18
end of the world here the end of the

4011.05 --> 4016.1200000000003
world there that we're getting kinda

4013.18 --> 4018.8199999999997
know but you gotta understand the world

4016.12 --> 4020.83
that is here now and how that makes us

4018.82 --> 4022.96
reflect upon these types of things and

4020.83 --> 4025.09
you're already dug in and solidified it

4022.96 --> 4026.41
very obviously it feels very much like

4025.09 --> 4030.04
your mind is said about it

4026.41 --> 4032.35
you have conviction but that's also kind

4030.04 --> 4035.74
of scary to me because it is something

4032.35 --> 4038.5299999999997
that's just like out of place solid in a

4035.74 --> 4042.0899999999997
way if that's really true what you're

4038.53 --> 4045.3100000000004
saying and I just wonder like okay how

4042.09 --> 4049.2400000000002
how do I really confirm if that's real

4045.31 --> 4051.61
except by exposing myself to more

4049.24 --> 4054.64
our explanations as to why that is real

4051.61 --> 4059.17
like how do I really know but I'll look

4054.64 --> 4061.66
carefully into it a bit thank you

4059.17 --> 4064.27
yes I'll let you go now and take care

4061.66 --> 4068.47
and keep up the good work Andy yeah

4064.27 --> 4070.06
Christ be with you and yeah

4068.47 --> 4074.77
hope to hear from you again there was a

4070.06 --> 4076.39
very very interesting conversation a bit

4074.77 --> 4079.03
out of left field to me but very

4076.39 --> 4083.3799999999997
interesting unless I'll probably be

4079.03 --> 4085.3300000000004
listening back just to see like while

4083.38 --> 4090.79
you put a date there at least that's

4085.33 --> 4093.4
interesting and I probably won't be

4090.79 --> 4095.41
forgetting this I think that I will

4093.4 --> 4098.38
would probably up until that very day be

4095.41 --> 4100.389999999999
wondering like oh yeah okay that date is

4098.38 --> 4108.79
approaching now you made it quite an

4100.39 --> 4111.490000000001
impact on me so god bless oh all right

4108.79 --> 4118.7699999999995
you too thank you very much

4111.49 --> 4122.759
you too Cheers Wow

4118.77 --> 4122.759
well that was fascinating

4124.779 --> 4130.27
got a bit swept away there it's like I

4127.469 --> 4132.4890000000005
felt almost like I should be halting

4130.27 --> 4135.43
certain aspects about it because it just

4132.489 --> 4138.37
piled on further and further it made it

4135.43 --> 4142.900000000001
kind of hard for me but there may be

4138.37 --> 4144.489
something to it at least it's not

4142.9 --> 4147.6089999999995
literally claiming an end of the world

4144.489 --> 4150.009
situation is basically claiming a return

4147.609 --> 4153.25
of the physical manifestation of the

4150.009 --> 4155.259
creator and that is fascinating and I

4153.25 --> 4157.87
wonder if there is some signs of this

4155.259 --> 4160.989
will we recognize will we see that when

4157.87 --> 4164.44
we look at it at the manifestation will

4160.989 --> 4168.009
we intuitively recognize our Creator if

4164.44 --> 4171.73
we are indeed attune to that and not to

4168.009 --> 4174.699
our ego that wants to be the Creator

4171.73 --> 4180.669999999999
will you be jealous as you behold the

4174.699 --> 4185.5
Creator or will you be in awe and in the

4180.67 --> 4189.67
peace I wonder so we have fascinating

4185.5 --> 4195.55
stuff fascinating conversation and bit

4189.67 --> 4202.17
blown away by it to be fair but anyway

4195.55 --> 4202.17
yeah that was that was Robin Mitchell

4204.579 --> 4210.78
and yeah I hope he comes back at some

4207.01 --> 4217.42
point that would be really interesting

4210.78 --> 4221.79
so apparently one was it 2021 April 1st

4217.42 --> 4221.79
right or was it August 1st

4222.54 --> 4227.469
anyway I'll look back you know it's all

4225.48 --> 4231.598999999999
recorded on the show I'll have to look

4227.469 --> 4231.599
back and see it's interesting

4240.199 --> 4248.15
I'm still getting quite cloudy out there

4242.63 --> 4250.4490000000005
but I don't mind nice and fresh for a

4248.15 --> 4250.449
change

4258.4 --> 4263.44
okay Trish Blythe go back and read the

4261.25 --> 4266.88
comments when you get a chance some good

4263.44 --> 4266.879999999999
information here okay

4267.03 --> 4277.2699999999995
let's see her evolution lie

4274.65 --> 4279.629999999999
hey Jimmy Bennett by the way I couldn't

4277.27 --> 4279.63
see you

4282.92 --> 4287.889
right

4285.159 --> 4290.53
uh yeah you know what in the face of it

4287.889 --> 4292.42
all of what he just told me I just

4290.53 --> 4297.969
noticed that yeah I am a god-fearing

4292.42 --> 4300.84
person but just I mean he's like oh [ __ ]

4297.969 --> 4304.679
oh really Jesus is actually coming back

4300.84 --> 4307.75
okay I kind of didn't think he would I

4304.679 --> 4310.09
thought that his spirit would come back

4307.75 --> 4312.07
through everyone like everyone would

4310.09 --> 4314.59
awaken to the truth in that kind of

4312.07 --> 4317.7699999999995
sense but maybe that is also happening

4314.59 --> 4320.469
and maybe Jesus is literally physically

4317.77 --> 4325.42
returning now apparently fascinating

4320.469 --> 4328.57
stuff no idea the weirdest thing is that

4325.42 --> 4331.15
all God's like oh no I actually have

4328.57 --> 4333.25
dark world fish in memories that kind of

4331.15 --> 4335.23
correlate with that and have been for a

4333.25 --> 4338.86
long time that makes it even more freaky

4335.23 --> 4344.349999999999
to me and I just hope that I did enough

4338.86 --> 4346.96
that I'm good enough that I in my way

4344.35 --> 4350.7390000000005
have made reparations and corrections to

4346.96 --> 4354.63
myself for the the attitude and the

4350.739 --> 4354.629999999999
arrogance I had in the past

4361.87 --> 4369.46
and I wonder sometimes like will if I

4364.78 --> 4376.12
face God will I be punished for for

4369.46 --> 4379.24
laziness because I in a way that has

4376.12 --> 4380.71
been like a like a sin to me at least

4379.24 --> 4383.38
that's how its kind of started out I

4380.71 --> 4387.4800000000005
rebelled like no working [ __ ]

4383.38 --> 4391.45
stupid people lose their minds

4387.48 --> 4395.23
come corrupted through [ __ ] and it just

4391.45 --> 4397.2699999999995
I couldn't I couldn't do it and then I

4395.23 --> 4402.219999999999
just started like okay [ __ ] I have to

4397.27 --> 4404.830000000001
somehow fill up that void and just work

4402.22 --> 4408.1
on anything and then not focus on money

4404.83 --> 4410.68
and that's basically how I then if all

4408.1 --> 4412.410000000001
of that but not extensively I'm not that

4410.68 --> 4415.360000000001
guy that's like working eight hours

4412.41 --> 4419.71
physically hard every day to compensate

4415.36 --> 4423.339999999999
that so am I will I be judged to be lazy

4419.71 --> 4424.9
in the face of God how bad will the

4423.34 --> 4431.95
punishment be will it mean I'll

4424.9 --> 4437.469999999999
basically have to work in heaven for the

4431.95 --> 4440.71
rest or I'll be or will I be put into

4437.47 --> 4443.2300000000005
hell for that and then just anxiously

4440.71 --> 4449.17
wanting to do work and never being able

4443.23 --> 4452.169999999999
to something like that I don't know all

4449.17 --> 4455.32
I know is that I really am trying to do

4452.17 --> 4457.84
my best and I do feel like I have fallen

4455.32 --> 4459.61
and that that is also part of the human

4457.84 --> 4462.99
experience in a way especially in our

4459.61 --> 4466.57
youth the temptation is so great to fall

4462.99 --> 4468.94
it's like almost impossible not to it's

4466.57 --> 4472.08
all about will you climb back out of it

4468.94 --> 4474.669999999999
or will you lose yourself forever there

4472.08 --> 4477.7
so I just hope that I did good enough

4474.67 --> 4483.16
and I also hope that I can fulfill

4477.7 --> 4489.13
basically my my life contract I would

4483.16 --> 4491.83
call it just not and they also have

4489.13 --> 4493.42
children real that be part of that

4491.83 --> 4498.929
process of that of

4493.42 --> 4503.46
for real and try to like pass on this

4498.929 --> 4505.84
this giant tool of the mind and an

4503.46 --> 4507.81
methodology of thinking and spiritual

4505.84 --> 4511.900000000001
sensing and all of that somehow and

4507.81 --> 4516.9400000000005
passing it on that's what I really hope

4511.9 --> 4519.849999999999
that I can still fulfill in the time

4516.94 --> 4524.678999999999
that is left here and I don't know if

4519.85 --> 4528.280000000001
they're yeah if that supposed 2021 date

4524.679 --> 4531.34
also means that pretty much it's the end

4528.28 --> 4535.0
of the earth that the normal time

4531.34 --> 4539.13
experience is over then and that the

4535.0 --> 4539.13
judgement just happens until the end or

4541.14 --> 4546.13
or maybe it's just a moment where

4544.12 --> 4548.41
something wonderous happens and

4546.13 --> 4552.55
everything basically just continues like

4548.41 --> 4558.67
normal after that I don't know but yeah

4552.55 --> 4562.03
I think that two years is probably not

4558.67 --> 4565.36
enough time for me to actually conceive

4562.03 --> 4570.91
a child so I just have I have no idea if

4565.36 --> 4577.36
if I can if that is still meant to be

4570.91 --> 4579.489
for me I who knows you know what I'm not

4577.36 --> 4582.489
even gonna see it as like an end date if

4579.489 --> 4585.19
like whether this is gonna happen or not

4582.489 --> 4587.5599999999995
I might be now focused on like oh that's

4585.19 --> 4594.699
might potentially be a special date like

4587.56 --> 4597.910000000001
originally I thought with 2012 or or

4594.699 --> 4601.949
it'll just pass and then I will stick to

4597.91 --> 4606.58
the long term plan which I have to

4601.949 --> 4610.0599999999995
believe is possible in order to continue

4606.58 --> 4612.82
building up that you can't just do it

4610.06 --> 4614.77
all of a sudden only because you finally

4612.82 --> 4617.04
feel it safe I have to work on the long

4614.77 --> 4617.040000000001
term

4645.05 --> 4650.24
all right

4647.61 --> 4650.24
but

4652.1 --> 4660.530000000001
I don't hate God at least I'm pretty

4654.83 --> 4665.0
sure of that and I I kind of did earlier

4660.53 --> 4667.219999999999
but in retrospect it really was just a

4665.0 --> 4669.23
straw man because I basically just hated

4667.22 --> 4672.9800000000005
myself and then I blamed the Creator

4669.23 --> 4675.44
like yeah why would you create me if I

4672.98 --> 4677.299999999999
end up just freakin hating everything

4675.44 --> 4680.8099999999995
that doesn't make any sense so I'm gonna

4677.3 --> 4684.08
blame God for making me screw it up

4680.81 --> 4685.820000000001
that's I guess very typical but then now

4684.08 --> 4688.61
we're talking about pretty screwed up

4685.82 --> 4690.38
part from my youth but I doubt

4688.61 --> 4692.63
definitely stepped away from that

4690.38 --> 4696.38
because it's just the deflection it's

4692.63 --> 4700.01
really just a straw man blame argument

4696.38 --> 4704.4400000000005
and I always felt eventually like yeah

4700.01 --> 4704.4400000000005
blaming God's just completely [ __ ]

4708.159 --> 4716.71
because yeah I'm doing it and if I make

4713.62 --> 4718.239
mistakes then yeah even though I might

4716.71 --> 4719.139
not have the tools to have made the

4718.239 --> 4722.799999999999
right decision

4719.139 --> 4726.61
it's still my mistake to make you can

4722.8 --> 4732.37
blame entirety of creations for your own

4726.61 --> 4734.259999999999
incompetence now the best thing you can

4732.37 --> 4737.949
do in the face of your own incompetence

4734.26 --> 4741.25
is simply take the hurt and learn from

4737.949 --> 4743.379999999999
it or survive through it and then

4741.25 --> 4749.35
afterwards learn from it and how to

4743.38 --> 4752.889
prevent that but yeah I have no no hate

4749.35 --> 4755.35
in my heart for God and I try not to

4752.889 --> 4761.4400000000005
have hate in my heart for anything or

4755.35 --> 4764.71
anyone I sometimes have contempt like as

4761.44 --> 4767.169999999999
a principle like I principally detest

4764.71 --> 4770.44
this type of behavior that type a ver

4767.17 --> 4775.469
and then I will respond to that properly

4770.44 --> 4780.12
but I rarely really have hate for people

4775.469 --> 4783.67
unless they in some way reflect like

4780.12 --> 4786.849999999999
such terrible behavior that it kind of

4783.67 --> 4789.61
brings me back to a time where I myself

4786.85 --> 4791.71
had very terrible behavior and then it

4789.61 --> 4794.62
becomes personal because their terrible

4791.71 --> 4796.9
behavior reminds me of my old terrible

4794.62 --> 4800.71
behavior and that's a moment when actual

4796.9 --> 4802.388999999999
hate might arrive and then I try to let

4800.71 --> 4804.01
go that as soon as possible because if

4802.389 --> 4808.17
you latch on then you become as

4804.01 --> 4815.05
miserable as those types of people so

4808.17 --> 4817.6
yeah I definitely avoid latching on to

4815.05 --> 4821.29
dark things as much as possible and

4817.6 --> 4823.4800000000005
sometimes weird ideas slip into my mind

4821.29 --> 4827.949
as I think about it just like sometimes

4823.48 --> 4830.08
I catch myself imagining what Satanists

4827.949 --> 4832.839999999999
would do or like how far would they go

4830.08 --> 4835.449
with their dark [ __ ] and why and then I

4832.84 --> 4837.969
catch myself just visualizing things

4835.449 --> 4841.12
that is like oh my god just visualizing

4837.969 --> 4841.63
this is just horrific for the soul and

4841.12 --> 4845.74
then I

4841.63 --> 4848.89
have to literally start in my mind slap

4845.74 --> 4852.34
my attention away from seeing that [ __ ]

4848.89 --> 4855.64
or or demons are gonna implant ideas I

4852.34 --> 4858.22
can feel it happen that something like

4855.64 --> 4861.58
that happened two days ago and was

4858.22 --> 4864.97
inspired by some type of music very

4861.58 --> 4866.74
gothic II classical music and then my

4864.97 --> 4868.39
mind just started wandering into that

4866.74 --> 4871.69
[ __ ] and before you know it I was

4868.39 --> 4873.610000000001
suddenly zoomed in on some region of

4871.69 --> 4875.169999999999
frequency that I shouldn't have and I

4873.61 --> 4878.29
almost got caught in there I'd to

4875.17 --> 4881.9800000000005
literally slap it away from my attention

4878.29 --> 4884.56
and then pray to Christ did a really an

4881.98 --> 4888.3099999999995
official pray spoken out and the funny

4884.56 --> 4891.31
thing was it worked instantly I said it

4888.31 --> 4894.400000000001
I meant it and just as I said that the

4891.31 --> 4898.6
words like broke like a light just

4894.4 --> 4900.099999999999
erased the images in the dark on which

4898.6 --> 4903.1900000000005
my mind was trained in it that

4900.1 --> 4904.780000000001
evaporated like a cloud very quickly in

4903.19 --> 4907.69
a matter of two seconds

4904.78 --> 4909.969999999999
praise the Christ told him to help me

4907.69 --> 4914.679999999999
stay on the straight path and for the

4909.97 --> 4917.740000000001
Archangel Michael to guide me and strike

4914.68 --> 4920.71
down the the seductions and the

4917.74 --> 4923.67
depressions and it worked it's it's

4920.71 --> 4926.05
become like a spell very quick

4923.67 --> 4928.51
disenchant the darkness spell and it

4926.05 --> 4930.28
works extremely well now I can do this I

4928.51 --> 4932.56
don't even need my healer for this

4930.28 --> 4934.66
anymore like in the real dark moments I

4932.56 --> 4938.410000000001
can do this it works it's solid I love

4934.66 --> 4942.67
it I love that I can do this now but if

4938.41 --> 4945.22
I get more piled on stress situation I

4942.67 --> 4950.2
got more weaken then I may still need

4945.22 --> 4951.9400000000005
him because for so far I can only dispel

4950.2 --> 4953.7699999999995
the darkness if I just have enough

4951.94 --> 4956.41
strength and I catch myself basically

4953.77 --> 4959.740000000001
getting seduced looking into dark places

4956.41 --> 4963.16
and then it works really well to use

4959.74 --> 4966.94
that and get get out of here get out of

4963.16 --> 4968.07
the darkness quickly and just be safe

4966.94 --> 4975.929999999999
again

4968.07 --> 4979.29
be with Christ again so it is

4975.93 --> 4981.84
fascinating on how it all works and how

4979.29 --> 4985.95
the mind can literally be a gateway to

4981.84 --> 4991.62
energies it really matters where you let

4985.95 --> 4995.429999999999
your mind dwell and I in the past I've

4991.62 --> 5000.07
let my mind dwell in the most in the

4995.43 --> 5003.200000000001
craziest of stuff it's like and that

5000.07 --> 5005.36
well that certainly did reflect itself

5003.2 --> 5010.13
on my dark world experience which was

5005.36 --> 5013.16
like literally unbearably horrific at

5010.13 --> 5019.07
times so I guess I have myself to blame

5013.16 --> 5020.84
for that I have myself from back then to

5019.07 --> 5023.98
blame for that because I did let my

5020.84 --> 5031.7300000000005
imagination wander in to things that

5023.98 --> 5033.799999999999
just shouldn't be thought off ever but I

5031.73 --> 5036.08
didn't do that anymore so I know from

5033.8 --> 5038.570000000001
the latter part of my experience that it

5036.08 --> 5042.5599999999995
was really tranquil for my dark world

5038.57 --> 5045.049999999999
experience and even quite boring but I

5042.56 --> 5047.21
was already also very conscious that

5045.05 --> 5049.25
that was actually a good sign that had

5047.21 --> 5052.7
meant that I got the darkness under

5049.25 --> 5057.44
control in this period so it's funny how

5052.7 --> 5060.08
I got this weird feedback from a past

5057.44 --> 5063.349999999999
experience that still reaches into the

5060.08 --> 5066.11
future and parallels all of this all of

5063.35 --> 5071.72
this normal time-based reality

5066.11 --> 5074.089999999999
experience for me so I'm doing good and

5071.72 --> 5076.42
gonna stay doing good and I just hope

5074.09 --> 5076.42
that

5078.73 --> 5084.468999999999
I'll just work my way through in

5081.17 --> 5088.06
sensible way and keep on wielding the

5084.469 --> 5088.06
right frequencies as I go

5108.41 --> 5111.04
what

5118.67 --> 5125.54
God's name why I just say it Jesus

5121.67 --> 5128.3
Christ and I know that there's better

5125.54 --> 5131.389
ways to address him it's all that it's

5128.3 --> 5134.869000000001
not to me literally it's not about the

5131.389 --> 5141.400000000001
word it's about the meaning it has to me

5134.869 --> 5144.32
as to where the closest part of the

5141.4 --> 5146.659
understanding of it how it is tied in

5144.32 --> 5151.159
and Jesus Christ was always that to be

5146.659 --> 5153.17
is the most energy-rich word that has

5151.159 --> 5155.839999999999
the most controversy surrounding it and

5153.17 --> 5161.6
I take it I've taken it and I've used I

5155.84 --> 5164.81
use that and in Dutch it's almost

5161.6 --> 5169.1
exactly the same in English it's Jesus

5164.81 --> 5173.6
Christ in Dutch it's Jesus Christus it's

5169.1 --> 5176.08
very very similar so that works for me

5173.6 --> 5180.01
really well and that is how I will

5176.08 --> 5180.01
understand the creator

5187.71 --> 5197.43
yeah now the thing is it's all of it all

5191.97 --> 5207.6
of it it's the Sun as the creator it's

5197.43 --> 5212.46
the flesh walk the earth is the the part

5207.6 --> 5212.820000000001
of the celestial cycles it it's all of

5212.46 --> 5217.16
it

5212.82 --> 5220.139999999999
all the interpretations of Christ and

5217.16 --> 5224.15
all the layers within the Bible from all

5220.14 --> 5231.570000000001
the perspective it's all of it all of it

5224.15 --> 5233.339999999999
at the same time so anyone who's going

5231.57 --> 5235.83
to be like oh but look I found this

5233.34 --> 5238.2
specific type of structure or pattern

5235.83 --> 5242.13
throughout the Bible that proves that

5238.2 --> 5245.49
not uses a man but it was actually the

5242.13 --> 5246.12
celestial phenomena well that's just

5245.49 --> 5247.32
stupid

5246.12 --> 5249.44
because what you're doing is you're

5247.32 --> 5252.75
taking you're literally cherry-picking

5249.44 --> 5254.91
one thing of the vastness of the

5252.75 --> 5256.8
complexities of what the Bible really is

5254.91 --> 5262.74
that multi-dimensional book it's

5256.8 --> 5265.59
incredibly brilliant and then saying oh

5262.74 --> 5268.17
this says that everything else can't be

5265.59 --> 5270.4400000000005
true then you're just stupid you didn't

5268.17 --> 5270.4400000000005
get it

5273.909 --> 5278.32
it's like taking a knitted sweater

5275.73 --> 5281.23
pulling out one thread and just saying

5278.32 --> 5284.11
look without this thread there is no

5281.23 --> 5285.428999999999
sweater and then you just unravel the

5284.11 --> 5290.28
whole thing and then you don't have a

5285.429 --> 5294.04
sweater because I'm pretty sure that all

5290.28 --> 5301.33
of the angles to the Bible all of it it

5294.04 --> 5303.429
all works out it's a multi angle book so

5301.33 --> 5307.929
every time somebody says no it's not

5303.429 --> 5310.12
this it's a misunderstanding that's it's

5307.929 --> 5312.34
always gonna have received the same

5310.12 --> 5315.219
response to me it's like yeah that's

5312.34 --> 5316.96
really interesting but that doesn't mean

5315.219 --> 5320.159
that all the other interpretations are

5316.96 --> 5324.03
wrong it means that that's also there

5320.159 --> 5324.03
yet another part

5355.6 --> 5360.31
oh really Oh Paula Hirst if you're not

5358.72 --> 5362.68
trying to offend me right

5360.31 --> 5366.400000000001
I need professional help I need a doctor

5362.68 --> 5370.450000000001
for what what are these symptoms

5366.4 --> 5373.03
Oh concerned Paula horse tease

5370.45 --> 5380.25
what are you concerns why do I need a

5373.03 --> 5385.2699999999995
doctor so much or is it just that you

5380.25 --> 5386.98
you just want to be banned is that it is

5385.27 --> 5388.81
that it Paula hearts teeth you just want

5386.98 --> 5392.879999999999
to be banned so you thought yeah let's

5388.81 --> 5392.88
let's be a dick

5402.26 --> 5404.89
well

5413.6 --> 5420.27
whoa-oh-oh demons you say oh did you

5417.6 --> 5423.51
hear words did you hear words I wasn't

5420.27 --> 5428.610000000001
using Paula horse teeth did you what

5423.51 --> 5430.110000000001
where did I use the word demons I think

5428.61 --> 5432.87
you might be hearing words I think you

5430.11 --> 5435.21
might be needing to visit a doctor for

5432.87 --> 5438.78
that because I'm pretty sure I didn't

5435.21 --> 5441.57
use the word demons in the entirety of

5438.78 --> 5445.38
the explanation including my dark world

5441.57 --> 5447.239
visions so maybe you should seek some

5445.38 --> 5450.1990000000005
help for that some professional help

5447.239 --> 5450.199
Paula Hart's teeth

5471.14 --> 5476.29
oh you presumed it did yeah

5482.34 --> 5490.71
all right oh you might have jumped to

5486.83 --> 5492.51
some conclusions there then my didn't

5490.71 --> 5496.56
you hmm

5492.51 --> 5498.179
maybe next time you know think about

5496.56 --> 5518.070000000001
what you're saying before you're gonna

5498.179 --> 5521.76
say it oh no no no I'm pretty sure I did

5518.07 --> 5525.299999999999
not I did mention a descriptor like

5521.76 --> 5528.54
demonic when I'm talking about really

5525.3 --> 5530.639
dark [ __ ] without actually then we're

5528.54 --> 5534.48
being required to describe what that is

5530.639 --> 5536.76
because I prefer not to I did use the

5534.48 --> 5539.848999999999
word demonic that's true but I never

5536.76 --> 5541.860000000001
talked about any demons look if there's

5539.849 --> 5543.6900000000005
gonna be and I did have some really

5541.86 --> 5546.679
weird [ __ ] in my experiences but if

5543.69 --> 5550.199
anything they're not really demons and

5546.679 --> 5552.75
from what I have seen that did kind of

5550.199 --> 5556.11
suggest that they might have been demons

5552.75 --> 5562.98
I wasn't really impressed by any of that

5556.11 --> 5565.199
at all so but there were some see me

5562.98 --> 5570.989
what seemed to me like entities that

5565.199 --> 5572.909
definitely did try to like go after me

5570.989 --> 5575.098999999999
make my life miserable make my

5572.909 --> 5577.44
experience miserable I did experience

5575.099 --> 5579.150000000001
some of that but I call them entities

5577.44 --> 5581.15
because I don't know what they were I

5579.15 --> 5583.5599999999995
don't know if they are literally

5581.15 --> 5585.48
reflections of my subconscious that are

5583.56 --> 5587.969
being personified in the experience

5585.48 --> 5590.5199999999995
doing that to me some aspect of myself

5587.969 --> 5594.15
doing that or if it is was literally an

5590.52 --> 5596.790000000001
extra dimensional entity outside of my

5594.15 --> 5600.0599999999995
own consciousness trying to interfere

5596.79 --> 5603.06
with me because sometimes it did kind of

5600.06 --> 5606.06
feel like I just wasn't alone in the

5603.06 --> 5610.9490000000005
room basically in the room of the Spirit

5606.06 --> 5612.81
it could few other presences so yeah

5610.949 --> 5615.08
dark world experiences it was pretty

5612.81 --> 5615.080000000001
weird

5622.039 --> 5627.4
hmmm I think it's a proficient pirate

5624.949 --> 5631.19
for the $2 super chair donation keep on

5627.4 --> 5637.759999999999
going your own path man here's some love

5631.19 --> 5640.25
thank you ma'am much appreciated but

5637.76 --> 5641.139
here you go again Paul our sister saying

5640.25 --> 5646.01
again

5641.139 --> 5649.369
demonic entities it's again a context

5646.01 --> 5652.67
that you put together that I didn't use

5649.369 --> 5655.46
I use the words demonic as in a

5652.67 --> 5659.5
description of like really nasty [ __ ]

5655.46 --> 5662.78
and I describe entities and then

5659.5 --> 5665.42
proceeded to explain what those entities

5662.78 --> 5667.88
could be interpreted as and you

5665.42 --> 5670.429
instantly put it together as demonic

5667.88 --> 5674.929
entities which is a context that I did

5670.429 --> 5678.11
not use specifically very typical very

5674.929 --> 5680.71
typical while the hearts teeth I got to

5678.11 --> 5680.71
do better than that

5706.329 --> 5709.0199999999995
right

5724.64 --> 5729.7300000000005
super dust what

5729.769 --> 5732.88
I don't get it

5738.78 --> 5746.16
oh yeah micro microchemistry nanotech

5744.59 --> 5748.95
basically what you're describing

5746.16 --> 5752.5199999999995
constant super dust is nanotech it's

5748.95 --> 5756.24
like control over mechanics on a

5752.52 --> 5761.01
molecular level by basically having like

5756.24 --> 5765.8
yeah encryption based on logical

5761.01 --> 5769.14
chemical processes and using that

5765.8 --> 5771.900000000001
natural stepping process as part of a

5769.14 --> 5774.2300000000005
mechanism on a micro scale it's very

5771.9 --> 5774.23
fascinating

5783.379 --> 5787.449
and Morgellons right

5788.499 --> 5795.88
now Morgellons is is like something else

5792.599 --> 5801.309
that's not a regular nanotech Morgellons

5795.88 --> 5803.289
is more like a it's a transformation

5801.309 --> 5806.53
bacteria it's a very basic thing that I

5803.289 --> 5808.63
think what it did is it used certain K

5806.53 --> 5813.13
in William plants oh yeah I would burrow

5808.63 --> 5816.099
in and then use certain chemicals to

5813.13 --> 5817.96
basically grow like hair and they would

5816.099 --> 5820.59
transform those specific types of

5817.96 --> 5826.36
chemicals locally and then create

5820.59 --> 5831.82
plastic out of it that was weird but

5826.36 --> 5834.94
that's not really regular nanotech it

5831.82 --> 5839.11
was like very mechanical experimental in

5834.94 --> 5841.749
the beginning yeah I think it's time for

5839.11 --> 5845.098999999999
you to go I'm sick of you you're a very

5841.749 --> 5848.349
annoying troll with a very annoying name

5845.099 --> 5851.579
saying very stupid and misleading things

5848.349 --> 5851.579
you're out of here

5870.81 --> 5874.349
[Music]

5892.01 --> 5896.8
yeah I'm starting to see a pattern here

5904.469 --> 5914.03
No maybe I was too hasty just these

5909.96 --> 5914.03
types of so what are you smoke you like

5915.53 --> 5919.94
you know what that sounds like right

5934.13 --> 5944.34
all right

5936.929 --> 5946.37
ah right yeah well I think I'm gonna run

5944.34 --> 5953.4890000000005
out to show it was really interesting

5946.37 --> 5963.179
especially with once again a guy coming

5953.489 --> 5966.69
on yeah Robin Mitchell I was interesting

5963.179 --> 5970.409
story I I wonder how much of that will

5966.69 --> 5973.71
eventually stick and is it real or is it

5970.409 --> 5978.21
yet another type of hype it could be you

5973.71 --> 5980.67
know it's I'm it just I won't go blindly

5978.21 --> 5983.31
with anything anymore because of just

5980.67 --> 5987.21
the sheer amount of things but I will

5983.31 --> 5990.929
try to keep this one in mind cuz it like

5987.21 --> 5995.7300000000005
the ground argumentation does seem kind

5990.929 --> 6001.52
of valid which is unusual because

5995.73 --> 6003.62
usually it kind of tends not to so yeah

6001.52 --> 6005.6900000000005
we'll see where that goes but anyway I

6003.62 --> 6008.54
am gonna round out the show so thanks

6005.69 --> 6012.739

6036.29 --> 6042.5
hours so be sure to tune in to Nathan

6039.679 --> 6045.92

6051.46 --> 6061.219
237 hashtag meifa of course don't forget

6056.239 --> 6063.9
about that and until the next video keep
