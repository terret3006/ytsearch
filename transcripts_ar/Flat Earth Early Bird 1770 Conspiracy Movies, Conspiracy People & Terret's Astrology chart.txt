396.08 --> 399.44
else was

401.84 --> 405.599

them

423.84 --> 427.63899999999995
yeah I I know I remember yeah I ended up

426.479 --> 431.479
watching

427.639 --> 433.36
snatch on Netflix it appeared on there

431.479 --> 436.639
so that's

433.36 --> 438.96000000000004
yeah thought it was interesting time to

436.639 --> 438.96000000000004
watch

439.16 --> 447.759
that also yesterday like with the clutch

443.08 --> 451.31899999999996

457.759 --> 464.879
he he hadn't

460.44 --> 468.479
seen soil and green and they live and

464.879 --> 472.68
like we were all completely shocked like

468.479 --> 474.0
what how the hell did you manage to not

472.68 --> 477.8
see

474.0 --> 477.8
those after all that

478.319 --> 481.319
time

483.039 --> 489.0
oh what a film I love snatch me yeah I

486.84 --> 491.71999999999997
bet you do I mean it was noted as like

489.0 --> 495.96
one of the most popular

491.72 --> 497.879
movies had a special Mark with it on

495.96 --> 499.08
Netflix it's like oh this is like the

497.879 --> 501.84000000000003
most

499.08 --> 504.75899999999996
upvoted so yeah it's a very Beloved

501.84 --> 508.31899999999996
movie apparently and it's kind of funny

504.759 --> 511.24
because it even was like way back like

508.319 --> 511.24
uh

511.84 --> 518.36
10 20 years ago that like I remember it

515.599 --> 518.36
from 20 years

518.68 --> 523.959
ago so it's a very popular

528.44 --> 532.9590000000001
movie are you fired five roads how can

531.72 --> 537.1600000000001
you be

532.959 --> 537.16
fired you financier

538.2 --> 541.2
me

542.68 --> 548.92
[Music]

544.0 --> 548.92
oh you just you just discovered Jordan

549.44 --> 555.32
maxel yeah he is kind of

552.76 --> 558.2
interesting he's one of the first people

555.32 --> 562.36
I've ever heard out there who suggested

558.2 --> 566.32
like a non-physical nature really about

562.36 --> 569.36
the moon I think it was or and or the

566.32 --> 572.36
Sun but then he went on by like real

569.36 --> 574.6800000000001
fying it in the plasma and yeah but he

572.36 --> 576.839
was the first one to kind of like sort

574.68 --> 580.04
of go in that direction was Jordan

576.839 --> 581.6400000000001
Maxwell right no wait what's the I'm now

580.04 --> 584.64
mixing it

581.64 --> 584.64
up

585.46 --> 588.519
[Music]

590.36 --> 597.839
wait no yeah we different

595.48 --> 599.76
Maxwell that guy now that's the

597.839 --> 604.32
conspiracy guy

599.76 --> 604.3199999999999
I remember him from Alex Jones and all

605.12 --> 610.839
that Seena is like a competitor of Alex

607.959 --> 610.8389999999999
Jones for a long

611.12 --> 617.8
time he had some weird ass

614.6 --> 620.0790000000001
ideas I had like this code thing going

617.8 --> 620.079
for

620.959 --> 627.56
himself he was like really into aliens

624.519 --> 632.2
and all that [ __ ] though

627.56 --> 632.1999999999999
so don't think he was a flat earther

634.079 --> 637.88
either but he is

642.639 --> 645.639
interesting

646.639 --> 651.48
yeah is Ry Piper in they live

658.04 --> 663.76
yes

660.959 --> 667.4399999999999
bro put on the

663.76 --> 671.519
glasses just put on the damn

667.44 --> 671.519
glasses of course you remember that

680.29 --> 683.5
[Music]

687.959 --> 690.959
movie

710.58 --> 713.619
[Music]

717.56 --> 723.56
all right and and the thing about they

719.399 --> 728.519
live is also is that it's filmed so

723.56 --> 729.7199999999999
well because it's so quick paste in a

728.519 --> 732.399
way it's

729.72 --> 734.1600000000001
like at first it like gives you a bit of

732.399 --> 737.399
time to just like think that everything

734.16 --> 738.519
is normal and then it like really like

737.399 --> 742.72
just

738.519 --> 746.5600000000001
slowly conspiracy sneaks in there and

742.72 --> 749.36
then it really gets a pace which is like

746.56 --> 750.4799999999999
in a way very unnatural I guess but I

749.36 --> 755.24
mean it

750.48 --> 757.04
is Rody Rody Piper so that makes it a

755.24 --> 759.6800000000001
little bit more believable that he just

757.04 --> 760.76
like Springs into action so quickly with

759.68 --> 763.88
it

760.76 --> 766.519
all right that's really the unbelievable

763.88 --> 768.56
Factor but I mean it's forgiven because

766.519 --> 771.48
he's such a cool guy you'd believe he

768.56 --> 773.4799999999999
would do that in the

771.48 --> 777.5600000000001
movie

773.48 --> 780.72
but like because think about that idea

777.56 --> 782.76
if they do that idea now like on Netflix

780.72 --> 784.839
they'd make a [ __ ] series out of it

782.76 --> 786.76
and like stretch it out to all hell

784.839 --> 790.6800000000001
before the real action happens or

786.76 --> 795.959
whatever you know that right but this

790.68 --> 799.04
movie is like it's pretty small and it

795.959 --> 800.959
like it's just such an excellent Pace

799.04 --> 803.959
like at the end of it you're like almost

800.959 --> 807.3199999999999
like yeah I can watch another one of

803.959 --> 811.7199999999999
these right that's because it's just

807.32 --> 811.72
shot so great such a great

814.0 --> 819.24
Pace I mean at the end of it I always

817.0 --> 822.56
feel like damn I wish there was like a a

819.24 --> 822.5600000000001
followup of this or

823.6 --> 827.36
something yeah something you don't

825.56 --> 830.5189999999999
really have with soil and green I mean

827.36 --> 832.9590000000001
that movie is

830.519 --> 836.12
brilliant and yeah it's called boring

832.959 --> 839.3199999999999
but I mean I think it's chilling instead

836.12 --> 841.68
because it's not boring because it just

839.32 --> 845.12
takes a long time and they're not into

841.68 --> 848.079
it it's just all so

845.12 --> 850.44
Dreadful right and that

848.079 --> 852.959
and it's like the

850.44 --> 855.2790000000001
boring really it's like the only

852.959 --> 858.959
freaking place in an old movie where it

855.279 --> 860.8389999999999
actually fits because it's all Dreadful

858.959 --> 862.0
it's supposed to be like that it makes

860.839 --> 864.6800000000001
it more

862.0 --> 866.959
real but it's not a pleased movie or

864.68 --> 870.68
anything at the end of it you're like oh

866.959 --> 870.68
I'm so relieved I finally finished

870.759 --> 879.839
that impressive but you know it is kind

874.8 --> 879.8389999999999
of tedious in a way it's just also

881.12 --> 887.32
Dreadful but they live is just a great

884.079 --> 887.3199999999999
movie a lot of fun to

889.68 --> 894.6389999999999
watch you

891.839 --> 896.1990000000001
think Maxwell figured out the globe

894.639 --> 900.36
light towards the

896.199 --> 904.04
end well we'll never really find out

900.36 --> 904.04
out I don't think

908.8 --> 914.16
so I mean I think Jordan M I might be

912.199 --> 916.3199999999999
getting this completely incorrect now

914.16 --> 918.16
because it's such a long time ago for me

916.32 --> 920.48
since I last watch anything Maxwell

918.16 --> 922.639
related but I think he was like one of

920.48 --> 925.04
those guys that was like a secret space

922.639 --> 927.279
program guy that believed that all these

925.04 --> 929.519
secret things were done and that that's

927.279 --> 932.92
the reason why the moon landings looked

929.519 --> 936.759
so fake and all that so I don't think he

932.92 --> 936.759
was a flat earther

937.079 --> 942.92
actually he wasn't gradually going to

940.279 --> 942.92
get to that

957.6 --> 960.6
point

970.399 --> 974.279
marit law right yeah

977.0 --> 982.079
yeah he did have like a lot of legal

979.88 --> 983.959
insights and all that but I mean you got

982.079 --> 987.519
to realize

983.959 --> 990.5189999999999
that some of it is a bit

987.519 --> 990.519
outdated

990.88 --> 997.16
like it's been developed better by now

994.959 --> 999.4799999999999
but I mean because a lot of people had a

997.16 --> 1002.7199999999999
lot of eyes on

999.48 --> 1005.0790000000001
him he was like really early with that

1002.72 --> 1008.12
what is now generally regarded I think

1005.079 --> 1011.5999999999999
or I regard it as such as Freeman stuff

1008.12 --> 1014.9590000000001
because Freeman was a guy that's like

1011.6 --> 1019.0790000000001
almost totally focused on like

1014.959 --> 1022.4399999999999
that n yeah uh law of the land and RMA

1019.079 --> 1023.919
law and all that and how that worked and

1022.44 --> 1028.24
how to be off

1023.919 --> 1031.16
grid and he survived Jordan Maxwell

1028.24 --> 1033.079
so so he kind of like carried that torch

1031.16 --> 1037.24
and that was

1033.079 --> 1037.24
like uh 15 years

1039.919 --> 1044.24
ago yeah roughly around that

1047.4 --> 1053.3600000000001
time

1050.36 --> 1056.1999999999998
but yeah if he hadn't shown up I maybe

1053.36 --> 1058.76
we'd call call it Jordan

1056.2 --> 1061.88
Maxwell you're going Jordan Maxwell on

1058.76 --> 1063.559
us or something I don't know I just call

1061.88 --> 1065.679
it the

1063.559 --> 1068.6789999999999
Freeman

1065.679 --> 1068.679
talk

1072.12 --> 1077.3999999999999
anyway interview with Santos when the

1075.48 --> 1080.4
hell did that

1077.4 --> 1080.4
happen

1081.0 --> 1083.32
wait

1090.28 --> 1093.48
what hold

1094.25 --> 1102.47
[Music]

1107.32 --> 1110.32
on

1114.76 --> 1120.72
bro wait

1117.72 --> 1120.72
what

1123.72 --> 1126.72
2022

1128.039 --> 1135.28
what I completely missed out on that I

1132.159 --> 1138.48
thought I thought he died

1135.28 --> 1140.6399999999999
like 10 years ago or something what what

1138.48 --> 1140.64
the

1143.6 --> 1147.6789999999999
hell I'm really confused

1152.44 --> 1155.44
now

1157.4 --> 1161.0
huh that's so

1167.24 --> 1170.24
weird

1175.96 --> 1180.08
he endorsed Santos oh

1197.24 --> 1200.24
goody

1204.76 --> 1207.76
okay

1213.64 --> 1217.5200000000002
weird hey clutch by the

1221.4 --> 1226.2
way wow I'm I'm a bit like

1227.159 --> 1230.159
surprised

1232.39 --> 1236.14
[Music]

1237.36 --> 1242.9599999999998
like who the hell was I thinking of

1239.96 --> 1245.679
then that's so weird how is that in my

1242.96 --> 1245.679
memory like

1253.69 --> 1260.1200000000001
[Music]

1257.12 --> 1260.12
that

1262.2 --> 1269.24
who's the other conspiracy guy I'm

1264.679 --> 1269.24
thinking of that died way back

1273.44 --> 1279.919
then apparently that wasn't Jordan

1275.76 --> 1283.919
Maxwell was another guy I'm

1279.919 --> 1288.2
really appalled by my own terrible lack

1283.919 --> 1289.8400000000001
of names lore if with all this stuff

1288.2 --> 1293.919
wish I was better

1289.84 --> 1296.1589999999999
at Cooper Bill

1293.919 --> 1298.3300000000002
Cooper was that the guy that I was

1296.159 --> 1300.6000000000001
thinking of that could be that could

1298.33 --> 1303.08
[Music]

1300.6 --> 1305.6789999999999
be yeah I think that's the guy that I

1303.08 --> 1305.6789999999999
was thinking

1306.159 --> 1313.44
of 2001 right yeah I mixed him up with

1310.32 --> 1313.4399999999998
Cooper you're right Bill

1317.039 --> 1320.039
Cooper

1320.679 --> 1327.5590000000002
yeah yeah I mixed him up sorry Jordan

1323.52 --> 1327.559
Maxwell well he's he's dead anyway

1334.679 --> 1341.72
but I wonder I might have actually met

1338.279 --> 1345.12
him face to face one time I'm not

1341.72 --> 1345.1200000000001
sure Jordan

1346.96 --> 1349.96
Maxwell

1357.64 --> 1360.24
RV

1360.88 --> 1365.3600000000001
truth he called Jordan a

1369.0 --> 1373.559
shill okay terod

1376.96 --> 1379.96
what

1383.36 --> 1387.0
you're not like talking

1390.4 --> 1396.44
about the terrible thing right that

1394.12 --> 1400.0
you're putting those spaces in there

1396.44 --> 1402.96
teret leaving out the words which are

1400.0 --> 1406.84
banned on this channel by the way

1402.96 --> 1406.8400000000001
but that's pretty messed

1406.88 --> 1409.88
up

1410.32 --> 1414.279
Michael Taran yeah yeah I know him

1424.12 --> 1427.29
[Music]

1430.72 --> 1435.679
yeah oh r a

1436.24 --> 1439.88
[ __ ] in a way

1445.4 --> 1452.88
I mean it's just like is what do you

1448.36 --> 1455.3999999999999
call that that sort of behavior is a bit

1452.88 --> 1458.0
conspirator can just get super rude

1455.4 --> 1460.3600000000001
about people and accuse them of all

1458.0 --> 1462.24
kinds of things when there's no real

1460.36 --> 1464.4799999999998
evidence for that so it's just a bit

1462.24 --> 1467.2
like a conspiratard I mean that's

1464.48 --> 1471.72
RV in a way we do kind of love him for

1467.2 --> 1471.72
it I guess or some people do not me not

1485.32 --> 1493.279
really but I mean

1488.679 --> 1495.5590000000002
I I never really trusted Jordan Maxwell

1493.279 --> 1499.52
there's something weird about him like

1495.559 --> 1502.12
that I'm catching on my feed of

1499.52 --> 1504.72
spiritual meta that there's just he's

1502.12 --> 1507.08
been involved in weird shady [ __ ]

1504.72 --> 1509.3990000000001
guarantee it he just had it all over him

1507.08 --> 1509.399
all the

1512.72 --> 1516.48
time so I

1517.76 --> 1523.919
felt like he knew things and was telling

1521.399 --> 1526.6789999999999
us something else

1523.919 --> 1528.8400000000001
instead that's what I felt about

1526.679 --> 1531.1200000000001
him

1528.84 --> 1534.399
he would in his knowledge bump into

1531.12 --> 1536.32
things and then like realize that he

1534.399 --> 1538.399
couldn't talk about it and then would

1536.32 --> 1541.559
just

1538.399 --> 1545.9189999999999
start telling another

1541.559 --> 1545.9189999999999
story a gatekeeper kind of

1549.279 --> 1553.44
yeah and but that made him really

1551.919 --> 1554.96
interesting though because because of

1553.44 --> 1557.279
that everybody was like oh what is he

1554.96 --> 1562.8400000000001
holding back what is he holding back oh

1557.279 --> 1565.679
right oh conspiracy conspiracy so yeah I

1562.84 --> 1568.08
mean he's like a conspiracy guy from the

1565.679 --> 1568.0800000000002
20th

1569.799 --> 1574.32
century they're all a little bit like

1575.76 --> 1581.399
that right they the older conspiracy

1579.08 --> 1584.08
people need to have some kind of like

1581.399 --> 1587.76
compelling theatrics to them to keep

1584.08 --> 1590.0
them going because well there most of

1587.76 --> 1593.0
that era there wasn't even an internet

1590.0 --> 1595.679
or anything right so that's just how

1593.0 --> 1597.6
they were because of that it would go to

1595.679 --> 1599.679
conventions and then just be really

1597.6 --> 1602.04
interested and everybody would go to the

1599.679 --> 1605.14
conventions to see them and all that

1602.04 --> 1605.1399999999999
[Music]

1605.48 --> 1612.32
right Ike is so bad why oh is this

1609.72 --> 1615.679
another oh let [ __ ] on everybody out

1612.32 --> 1619.8799999999999
there day is it everybody's terrible

1615.679 --> 1622.72
again the [ __ ] why is what the hell did

1619.88 --> 1622.72
Ike ever do to

1626.44 --> 1630.88
you why is Ike the Batman

1634.36 --> 1641.52
now I'm seriously what the [ __ ] did

1637.44 --> 1644.8400000000001
David Ike ever do wrong ever to

1641.52 --> 1647.8799999999999
anybody seriously why the [ __ ] does

1644.84 --> 1651.1999999999998
everybody always talk [ __ ] about David

1647.88 --> 1651.2
or so many people I don't get

1651.64 --> 1657.1200000000001
it

1653.84 --> 1660.24
like you could call him boring perhaps

1657.12 --> 1663.559
or like yeah we get it already I get

1660.24 --> 1667.08
that right but I mean he is like

1663.559 --> 1669.76
addressing a much wider

1667.08 --> 1672.76
public he's not super

1669.76 --> 1672.76
Niche

1675.24 --> 1680.559
really he's like kind of kind of there

1677.96 --> 1682.88
to lift up the the veil for the common

1680.559 --> 1684.96
folk in a way that's what he does that's

1682.88 --> 1688.7600000000002
how he talks that's why he has these

1684.96 --> 1692.48
insanely large audiences of like

1688.76 --> 1696.2
thousands of people that watch him live

1692.48 --> 1697.3990000000001
yeah gatekeeper oh such a gatekeeper no

1696.2 --> 1700.0800000000002
he's not a

1697.399 --> 1702.559
gatekeeper I met him in person and I

1700.08 --> 1705.519
told him the Earth was

1702.559 --> 1709.1589999999999
flat and he

1705.519 --> 1712.0
agreed he was just not

1709.159 --> 1712.0
it was not his

1714.919 --> 1720.44
thing yeah not Ballard

1723.48 --> 1729.919
gatekeeper yeah it doesn't work you

1726.159 --> 1732.519
don't get the [ __ ] wide audiences if

1729.919 --> 1736.3990000000001
you say the Earth is flat your [ __ ]

1732.519 --> 1739.29
don't you get it terret for [ __ ] sake

1736.399 --> 1741.399
man

1739.29 --> 1743.799
[Music]

1741.399 --> 1747.1999999999998
there's more to the damn world than the

1743.799 --> 1747.2
earth being flat

1749.46 --> 1752.529
[Music]

1752.84 --> 1757.6399999999999
okay I

1754.64 --> 1757.64
mean

1759.679 --> 1765.1200000000001
seriously he's not a flat earther like

1762.799 --> 1767.48
everybody has to just [ __ ] everything up

1765.12 --> 1769.1999999999998
just so you could be a flat earther what

1767.48 --> 1771.0
the [ __ ] is wrong with you don't you get

1769.2 --> 1775.919
how this world works

1771.0 --> 1778.399
man it it doesn't work like that

1775.919 --> 1781.3990000000001
yeah it's everywhere the ball is

1778.399 --> 1783.799
everywhere it's in everybody's head if

1781.399 --> 1787.4399999999998
you just go flat earther yeah you go

1783.799 --> 1790.32
broke you dumb [ __ ] you don't get the

1787.44 --> 1793.559
huge audiences you don't get the

1790.32 --> 1797.4399999999998
international attention

1793.559 --> 1800.559
then not because gatekeeper it's because

1797.44 --> 1802.64
everyone is programmed like that it's

1800.559 --> 1804.6399999999999
not his freaking fault yeah it's not

1802.64 --> 1808.76
David Ike's fault that everybody's a

1804.64 --> 1808.76
[ __ ] Ballard out there

1813.02 --> 1816.16
[Music]

1818.24 --> 1823.24
okay he's a very cool guy and he is not

1822.399 --> 1826.84
a

1823.24 --> 1832.1200000000001
Ballard it's just not his thing he's not

1826.84 --> 1832.12
doing that you can't afford to do

1836.6 --> 1843.559
that like if from the vantage point that

1839.72 --> 1845.96
he is there's a very very good chance

1843.559 --> 1848.0
that if he just blatantly came out like

1845.96 --> 1850.559
oh yeah you know what the Earth is flat

1848.0 --> 1853.6
and all that there's a good chance that

1850.559 --> 1856.6
they would actually like kidnap him and

1853.6 --> 1859.8799999999999
put him in a padded room under drugs

1856.6 --> 1863.0
something like that because of his

1859.88 --> 1866.0800000000002
Fame when you do it when you're famous

1863.0 --> 1869.36
it has severe

1866.08 --> 1871.6789999999999
consequences they [ __ ] you up when you

1869.36 --> 1873.4399999999998
do that or at least they used to they

1871.679 --> 1877.2
might not even do it anymore the point

1873.44 --> 1880.3990000000001
is is that there's no point in risking

1877.2 --> 1881.3600000000001
that you're going to lose a giant chunk

1880.399 --> 1883.9599999999998
of your

1881.36 --> 1889.1589999999999
audience at

1883.96 --> 1889.159
best he's not a [ __ ] idiot

1893.05 --> 1896.1499999999999
[Music]

1897.12 --> 1903.9599999999998
Jordan Maxwell might be open but he

1899.12 --> 1903.9599999999998
wasn't like hey guys the Earth is flat

1905.24 --> 1911.44
yeah none of them

1908.039 --> 1913.519
are that's why you know them that's why

1911.44 --> 1916.6390000000001
you've heard of them that's why people

1913.519 --> 1919.159
know about them because they didn't do

1916.639 --> 1919.1589999999999
that

1922.66 --> 1930.99
[Music]

1931.6 --> 1937.84
yeah the world doesn't work like that

1935.36 --> 1941.0
the world of humans doesn't work like

1937.84 --> 1942.4399999999998
that you can't afford to do that if you

1941.0 --> 1945.36
if you do it while you have a huge

1942.44 --> 1949.44
audience that's a high

1945.36 --> 1951.36
risk unless you're like the Communist

1949.44 --> 1952.679
Overlord and then you can say whatever

1951.36 --> 1955.36
the [ __ ] you want because you're going

1952.679 --> 1958.72
to say it with pity towards everybody

1955.36 --> 1961.6789999999999
anyway because you despise everybody

1958.72 --> 1963.44
right like Obama not time for flutter

1961.679 --> 1965.2
Society like yeah he can just [ __ ]

1963.44 --> 1966.279
joke around with it because he is a

1965.2 --> 1968.76
communist

1966.279 --> 1973.2
Overlord that doesn't care whether you

1968.76 --> 1973.2
all live or die anyway

1974.2 --> 1979.039
right big

1976.039 --> 1979.039
difference

1984.639 --> 1988.12
but David Ike is a good

1995.24 --> 2004.32
guy don't don't [ __ ] with him don't do

1999.799 --> 2007.36
this [ __ ] just stop being a [ __ ] to

2004.32 --> 2010.96
every person that doesn't necessarily

2007.36 --> 2014.039
talk about Flat Earth I mean seriously

2010.96 --> 2016.799
guys the world is bigger than the damn

2014.039 --> 2016.799
Flat Earth

2019.519 --> 2026.36
okay you just need good people world's

2023.6 --> 2029.399
like being attacked like psychologically

2026.36 --> 2031.4799999999998
from all sides we just need good people

2029.399 --> 2034.32
I mean [ __ ] the Flat Earth in the face

2031.48 --> 2036.72
of all that I'm not going to let it go

2034.32 --> 2038.639
I'm not going to sell out or whatever

2036.72 --> 2042.919
but but I mean it's really not that

2038.639 --> 2046.519
important in the larger scale of things

2042.919 --> 2051.839
okay and definitely not important enough

2046.519 --> 2051.839
to say oh bring him down like what the

2058.699 --> 2064.48
[Music]

2061.159 --> 2067.48
[ __ ] not everybody is aware and awake or

2064.48 --> 2070.32
ready to deal with that at all like a

2067.48 --> 2073.839
lot of David ik's audience I'll bet you

2070.32 --> 2076.3590000000004
a lot of David ik's audience do actually

2073.839 --> 2079.96
entertain that the Earth is flat I'll

2076.359 --> 2085.24
guarantee you that right and that's the

2079.96 --> 2087.679
funny thing so do Alex Jones followers

2085.24 --> 2090.24
yeah who are kind of annoyed with Alex

2087.679 --> 2093.159
Jones that he's such a [ __ ] balart

2090.24 --> 2095.2799999999997
but at least they've got like Greg ree

2093.159 --> 2099.32
who makes

2095.28 --> 2101.3590000000004
fantastic really seriously NASA

2099.32 --> 2105.44
criticizing Globe Earth model

2101.359 --> 2109.64
criticizing videos now yeah who is like

2105.44 --> 2113.7200000000003
a a champion one at the round table of

2109.64 --> 2116.4
the Alex Jones sector yeah he's a pretty

2113.72 --> 2119.16
fullon flat earther he's not like a flat

2116.4 --> 2122.44
[ __ ] who makes flat [ __ ] videos but I

2119.16 --> 2122.44
mean he makes the

2124.72 --> 2132.56
videos like space is a lot

2128.52 --> 2134.88
yeah that's like a champion over at Alex

2132.56 --> 2137.359
Jones you can't then say he's a ball

2134.88 --> 2140.96
gatekeeper that's all he does no no Alex

2137.359 --> 2144.2799999999997
Jones is genuinely a Ballard he's one of

2140.96 --> 2147.8
those guys when you say it he's

2144.28 --> 2149.52
like it's just like he gets weird

2147.8 --> 2152.5600000000004
because he can't handle it it's

2149.52 --> 2157.16
something psychological about

2152.56 --> 2160.68
him it's not all the the the contract

2157.16 --> 2163.2
says we can't do that no that's not how

2160.68 --> 2167.64
that is he's genuinely a

2163.2 --> 2170.319
Ballard he gets like confronted with it

2167.64 --> 2172.359
I think even by his own crew like

2170.319 --> 2175.24
they're really figuring out that Alex

2172.359 --> 2178.16
Jones is actually a Ballard that's

2175.24 --> 2180.7599999999998
starting to remind them of like Flat

2178.16 --> 2182.7999999999997
Earth debates in the early bird

2180.76 --> 2186.4
show

2182.8 --> 2188.7200000000003
maybe if they watch that which would be

2186.4 --> 2188.7200000000003
weird

2189.319 --> 2195.72
but who knows I do talk about

2192.0 --> 2197.359
like psychedelic things and like the

2195.72 --> 2200.0
Dark World Experience I'm pretty sure

2197.359 --> 2202.92
that if Alex

2200.0 --> 2206.119
Jones like it should remind it's very

2202.92 --> 2206.119
similar to what Alex

2206.359 --> 2211.64
does even with the passionate Rants and

2209.079 --> 2214.4
all that so I don't

2211.64 --> 2217.04
know it just that's just because I have

2214.4 --> 2220.6800000000003
that in me and I recognize that about Al

2217.04 --> 2223.72
Al when I first bumped into Alex Jones I

2220.68 --> 2227.96
felt something like finally somebody

2223.72 --> 2230.68
that's actually doing it doing that with

2227.96 --> 2230.68
themselves

2230.8 --> 2236.2000000000003
like and

2232.72 --> 2236.2
then I did

2237.44 --> 2244.359
it cuz now I sort of had an example of

2241.2 --> 2246.359
like not fully I didn't go full Alex

2244.359 --> 2249.119
Jones I didn't like because I've never

2246.359 --> 2252.24
really I've been I was already withdrawn

2249.119 --> 2254.8
from society pretty much in that

2252.24 --> 2257.839
sense so I didn't like get out there and

2254.8 --> 2257.8390000000004
get in everybody's

2263.64 --> 2268.72
face but I'm here right now partially

2267.16 --> 2271.52
thanks to Alex

2268.72 --> 2274.72
Jones like waking me up like he was the

2271.52 --> 2277.88
one that really he was the whip that

2274.72 --> 2280.64
snapped me out of it

2277.88 --> 2280.6400000000003
at a later

2280.88 --> 2287.8
age when I was already kind of

2284.839 --> 2291.4
like I knew things were bad it's just

2287.8 --> 2294.119
that I couldn't handle it to the point

2291.4 --> 2297.56
where I could like see it have an

2294.119 --> 2300.119
oversight and let it settle I and Alex

2297.56 --> 2302.52
helped me with that in a way by really

2300.119 --> 2304.599
just like ramming through the terrible

2302.52 --> 2307.96
like the nightmares just piling it on

2304.599 --> 2309.1600000000003
like how terrible you could see it has

2307.96 --> 2312.68
and in a way that's like

2309.16 --> 2318.04
overcompensation but it has hardened me

2312.68 --> 2318.04
in a way to accept like

2318.079 --> 2325.5600000000004
yeah the details of reality can be

2321.56 --> 2325.56
unbelievably nightmarish and

2325.64 --> 2330.7599999999998
evil thanks to mankind what they

2331.079 --> 2338.28
do when before Alex Jones I was just

2334.52 --> 2340.64
completely incapable of of accepting

2338.28 --> 2343.76
anything like

2340.64 --> 2348.0
that I couldn't accept

2343.76 --> 2351.76
that really evil people could be in

2348.0 --> 2354.52
government that people would allow

2351.76 --> 2356.0400000000004
that that there wasn't a fail safe

2354.52 --> 2358.0
mechanism that as soon as that was

2356.04 --> 2360.119
spotted that they'd immediately be

2358.0 --> 2362.44
pulled out like

2360.119 --> 2365.2400000000002
automatically I just didn't get that I

2362.44 --> 2365.2400000000002
couldn't accept

2365.44 --> 2368.44
that

2370.119 --> 2377.52
all right so anyway they all have their

2373.52 --> 2380.52
function Alex Jones David Ike and for

2377.52 --> 2380.52
some people Jordan

2385.16 --> 2392.48
Maxwell I was never a really big

2388.64 --> 2392.48
fan at Jordan Max

2393.839 --> 2399.96
solo I felt that he had really

2397.24 --> 2403.2
interesting

2399.96 --> 2406.28
insights but his overall story I felt

2403.2 --> 2406.2799999999997
that it was like it

2408.04 --> 2415.07
was flustered and

2411.83 --> 2415.0699999999997
[Music]

2417.72 --> 2422.3999999999996
inconsistent perhaps he had undergone a

2420.2 --> 2425.359
dark World Vision and he just never

2422.4 --> 2428.359
really figured it

2425.359 --> 2428.359
out

2432.76 --> 2438.8390000000004
because he apparently had seen some

2435.92 --> 2441.319
things which I would directly associate

2438.839 --> 2443.2
with the dark world but it it never like

2441.319 --> 2445.4
he never gave any signal that he

2443.2 --> 2449.56
actually got that about

2445.4 --> 2451.839
it he was very Skitty Jordan Maxwell

2449.56 --> 2457.72
against like a loen agent and that that

2451.839 --> 2459.44
type of thing scared of it remember that

2457.72 --> 2461.8799999999997
maybe that kind of changed in the later

2459.44 --> 2461.88
years

2466.16 --> 2469.72
though I have no

2474.76 --> 2479.8
idea but yeah and to be fair I mean I'm

2477.599 --> 2483.0
technically scared of it too because

2479.8 --> 2485.2400000000002
well I have undergone it and it is

2483.0 --> 2488.24
freaking

2485.24 --> 2488.24
scary

2488.72 --> 2492.7999999999997
or it was for

2490.27 --> 2496.0
[Music]

2492.8 --> 2499.15
me hey Bill night sence good to see

2548.25 --> 2553.68
[Music]

2550.359 --> 2553.68
I had to make that joke of

2554.92 --> 2561.2400000000002
course right

2557.04 --> 2561.24
anyway please don't diss on

2561.44 --> 2567.48
Ike I appreciate that I actually would

2565.04 --> 2570.96
think it would be extremely cool if I'd

2567.48 --> 2572.8
ever have that opportunity to like do a

2570.96 --> 2574.92
show with him or something but I don't

2572.8 --> 2576.599
know maybe like the I don't know if

2574.92 --> 2580.599
that's even if he would ever do

2576.599 --> 2583.7200000000003
something like that a random like me or

2580.599 --> 2585.8
flat earther random like me if he dare

2583.72 --> 2587.64
that he might dare

2585.8 --> 2590.52
it I don't

2587.64 --> 2592.16
know I just really like want to tell him

2590.52 --> 2593.359
like Hey do you remember like the

2592.16 --> 2596.96
conference

2593.359 --> 2599.2799999999997
in in utra because it was in utra at the

2596.96 --> 2603.52
time right next to

2599.28 --> 2603.52
it in the

2603.92 --> 2608.079
west right outside of the Ring

2609.319 --> 2616.96
in 2010 or 11 I just want to ask him if

2613.359 --> 2620.52
he remembers that he met me then and

2616.96 --> 2620.52
that I told him about the Flat

2621.359 --> 2625.839
Earth I just want to know if he

2631.28 --> 2636.96
remembers I been a

2633.92 --> 2639.52
hero Jordan Maxwell taught him back in

2636.96 --> 2642.079
the day I don't know if they know each

2639.52 --> 2644.96
other I mean Jordan Maxwell is American

2642.079 --> 2644.96
David IES is

2649.2 --> 2653.5989999999997
British I don't know if they ever even

2653.76 --> 2658.2000000000003
met so I don't know what you're talking

2655.92 --> 2658.2000000000003
about

2665.0 --> 2668.0
tered

2668.559 --> 2674.3590000000004
Jordan got him first oh okay H

2683.72 --> 2689.68
interesting well maybe maybe

2686.52 --> 2694.52
actually Jordan Maxwell maybe he did

2689.68 --> 2697.96
give him some tips David Ike because as

2694.52 --> 2699.8
I said Jordan is like a a 20th century

2697.96 --> 2702.599
conspiracy

2699.8 --> 2705.4
guy they're like in ways they are

2702.599 --> 2708.8
attention magicians they that's just

2705.4 --> 2711.7200000000003
like what that is what it became and he

2708.8 --> 2713.6800000000003
he probably taught David some gave him

2711.72 --> 2715.7599999999998
some tips and like hey you want a big

2713.68 --> 2718.5589999999997
freaking audience you want a conspiracy

2715.76 --> 2720.599
audience this is this is like how I do

2718.559 --> 2723.0
it and this is how you should do it and

2720.599 --> 2726.2000000000003
he probably did take those tips and it

2723.0 --> 2729.16
did help cuz as I said like Jordan

2726.2 --> 2730.24
Maxwell in a way he was like a wizard

2729.16 --> 2734.8799999999997
kind of

2730.24 --> 2737.52
type like he he knew about attention and

2734.88 --> 2741.92
and how that

2737.52 --> 2747.359
works is he was not dumb like he was a

2741.92 --> 2750.599
very like very sharp in a way guy on

2747.359 --> 2753.7999999999997
Behavior I know that about Jordan

2750.599 --> 2754.88
Maxwell you're the only wizard we need

2753.8 --> 2757.88
am

2754.88 --> 2757.88
I

2767.319 --> 2773.88
no they one lonely wizard just

2771.16 --> 2776.04
sucks Wizards need other Wizards to

2773.88 --> 2780.359
learn

2776.04 --> 2780.359
from to reflect to

2781.16 --> 2788.5589999999997
compare to to keep going the development

2785.64 --> 2792.2
right if a wizard is just alone and

2788.559 --> 2792.2000000000003
isolated how are you going to

2794.119 --> 2799.44
develop I mean you got to be obsessed

2796.64 --> 2801.68
about things to even develop because

2799.44 --> 2802.559
development really works in relation to

2801.68 --> 2805.7599999999998
other

2802.559 --> 2805.76
people with

2807.48 --> 2812.28
Wizardry people generally only

2810.76 --> 2816.28

[Music]

3157.119 --> 3162.319
great

3159.72 --> 3166.359
right I think they're technically

3162.319 --> 3167.799
vegetarian so they're not gay vegan and

3166.359 --> 3170.48
all

3167.799 --> 3173.44
that but still like a lot of people

3170.48 --> 3177.16
would be able to eat

3173.44 --> 3181.839
that it's like a uni sex

3177.16 --> 3181.839

[Music]

3190.46 --> 3193.539
[Music]

3198.68 --> 3204.16
whatever oh okay yeah tet yeah I know

3201.559 --> 3207.1600000000003
the multiples are three

3204.16 --> 3207.16
369

3213.44 --> 3217.0
it's Lord

3215.48 --> 3219.2
sh

3217.0 --> 3221.52
okay

3219.2 --> 3225.839
huh interesting

3221.52 --> 3228.839
terret I didn't know that there was like

3225.839 --> 3231.04
Trinity lore related to Shiva that's

3228.839 --> 3231.04
that's

3234.16 --> 3237.16
interesting

3240.96 --> 3244.92
right because there I do know the the

3243.359 --> 3248.119
Trinity right but I didn't know there

3244.92 --> 3252.559
were numbers tied into

3248.119 --> 3255.6400000000003
that so what are the numbers tied into

3252.559 --> 3259.28
Vishnu for

3255.64 --> 3259.2799999999997
example what was the other

3260.0 --> 3263.0
one

3264.079 --> 3270.319
Brahma

3266.24 --> 3273.0
wasn't it Brahma Shiva Vishnu wasn't

3270.319 --> 3273.0
that the Hindu

3281.18 --> 3284.29
[Music]

3286.48 --> 3292.16
Trinity

3289.16 --> 3294.0789999999997
oh oh okay so even the celestials are

3292.16 --> 3297.0789999999997
tied in with that

3294.079 --> 3297.079
okay

3301.82 --> 3308.7200000000003
[Music]

3303.64 --> 3308.72
H nine is the Trinity of trinities

3324.0 --> 3327.0
yes

3331.68 --> 3336.52
although the real Trinity is

3337.92 --> 3344.039
27 cuz that's 3 * 3 * 3 you

3350.38 --> 3353.55
[Music]

3354.0 --> 3357.0
see

3367.63 --> 3370.82
[Music]

3383.92 --> 3386.92
h

3393.48 --> 3401.76
seven the number of life oh God here we

3397.839 --> 3404.68
go here we go the conspiracy numbers

3401.76 --> 3408.2400000000002
it's the numbers no it's fine if you

3404.68 --> 3408.24
want to do that for a bit that's

3408.319 --> 3413.72
fine but it is a bit silly though or it

3411.4 --> 3413.7200000000003
can

3413.88 --> 3416.88
be

3417.319 --> 3421.68
or you can take it really freaking

3419.319 --> 3424.16
serious and make like a heavy charge

3421.68 --> 3426.0
spell in which numbers like really

3424.16 --> 3429.319
represent like a

3426.0 --> 3433.52
certain frequency of the universe and

3429.319 --> 3436.119
then yeah that's not to be joked

3433.52 --> 3437.839
about but if you're just going to yap on

3436.119 --> 3442.039
like oh this number is dead and that

3437.839 --> 3442.0389999999998
number yeah then it gets kind of silly

3443.799 --> 3446.799
typically

3453.92 --> 3460.48
o 147 really that's

3457.079 --> 3463.92
Rama that is so fascinating because I am

3460.48 --> 3463.92
so fascinated by

3466.319 --> 3471.079
14710 like that's

3468.48 --> 3474.039
magical to

3471.079 --> 3475.76
me like I that's a pattern that kept

3474.039 --> 3478.44
reoccurring

3475.76 --> 3482.2400000000002
in my Dungeons and Dragons creation

3478.44 --> 3485.44
trolls and tyrants in like how I how you

3482.24 --> 3487.9599999999996
divide like you had to spread out

3485.44 --> 3490.319
certain type of bonuses you would get or

3487.96 --> 3493.52
abilities you would attain at a certain

3490.319 --> 3497.2799999999997
pace of gaining levels and

3493.52 --> 3502.72
14710 13 17

3497.28 --> 3506.119
Etc or uh yeah 13

3502.72 --> 3509.319
16 19

3506.119 --> 3513.119
2225 yeah that that is a pattern that

3509.319 --> 3516.68
was like very useful fascinating that's

3513.119 --> 3516.6800000000003
Brahma according to

3524.119 --> 3532.6800000000003
you it is the Orion Hunter with bow and

3527.72 --> 3532.68
I have my bow having in my room

3532.839 --> 3539.359
bro see I mean my subconscious knows

3536.839 --> 3542.2799999999997
what's up you

3539.359 --> 3544.92
know I knew I was supposed to hang a bow

3542.28 --> 3551.1600000000003
in there because one

3544.92 --> 3553.76
day a young man from India would tell me

3551.16 --> 3556.7599999999998
that I'm an

3553.76 --> 3556.76
an

3556.799 --> 3564.2
anent

3559.039 --> 3567.92
NRA my anent mashra is AR six which

3564.2 --> 3571.5989999999997
Falls in Gemini it is the Orion Hunter

3567.92 --> 3573.48
with bow and you are known for having

3571.599 --> 3578.52
that in your

3573.48 --> 3578.52
room and that's why I hang it up in my

3585.64 --> 3590.5989999999997
room and yeah the way I just roll that

3588.68 --> 3592.8799999999997
out that sounds really kind of silly and

3590.599 --> 3592.88
that's

3593.64 --> 3596.64
fine

3598.96 --> 3604.319
but it is kind of funny though like cool

3602.359 --> 3606.44
I'm I'm that's interesting you come to

3604.319 --> 3608.319
that conclusion I just have a bow I just

3606.44 --> 3611.839
happen to have a bow and just decided

3608.319 --> 3614.92
like yeah that's going to be my backdrop

3611.839 --> 3618.68
and hey I'm an elf you know Arwin is an

3614.92 --> 3622.2400000000002
elven name based on Tolen Elven

3618.68 --> 3624.7599999999998
language chosen so by my own

3622.24 --> 3626.3999999999996
mother with my permission by the way she

3624.76 --> 3629.28
asked me do you want to have that as a

3626.4 --> 3631.92
middle name and I did as I was

3629.28 --> 3634.52
fascinated with

3631.92 --> 3635.799
talking and that's kind of the reason I

3634.52 --> 3639.2
had a

3635.799 --> 3641.96
bow CU like a bow is the weapon of

3639.2 --> 3644.16
choice for an elf besides certain types

3641.96 --> 3644.16
of

3653.52 --> 3658.0
blades and Bs are just pretty

3663.64 --> 3670.0389999999998
