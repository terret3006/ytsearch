freaking uh this guy named lion almost

247.76 --> 253.28

249.519 --> 253.519
a youtube channel that would help with

the

253.519 --> 260.0
trump um you know losing the election

286.639 --> 292.8
what's that does it get through

290.0 --> 293.84
yeah yeah then one person responded with

292.8 --> 299.04
like a thumbs up

293.84 --> 300.96
and x um if it was a channel i said yes

299.04 --> 303.68
that people could find it right if they

300.96 --> 303.68
if they um

304.4 --> 307.75899999999996
yeah they just type my name will they be

306.32 --> 309.28
able to find your channel

307.759 --> 310.8
yeah it brings up my channel if you do a

309.28 --> 311.35999999999996
search for me it does actually bring me

310.8 --> 312.88
up with

311.36 --> 314.639
a list of whatever i've published most

312.88 --> 316.4
recently that's the first thing at the

314.639 --> 318.639
top so i do actually have

316.4 --> 320.0
some level of publicity if people search

318.639 --> 322.8
for me by name

320.0 --> 322.8
you will find me

323.039 --> 328.32
they could eventually get on here yeah

326.16 --> 331.52000000000004
they'll find that way

328.32 --> 335.199
okay good yeah so that's my little

331.52 --> 339.52
that's my little uh contribution

335.199 --> 341.039
thank you neil

339.52 --> 343.75899999999996
on today's live show i'm going to be

341.039 --> 345.84
promoting three channels

343.759 --> 348.72
first one's going to be authentic intent

345.84 --> 352.479
do you guys watch josh

348.72 --> 354.47900000000004
who's that well there you go you see

352.479 --> 356.08
so i'll stick a link straight away in

354.479 --> 357.199
the uh

356.08 --> 359.52
live stream so there's at least

357.199 --> 360.40000000000003
something something there when they

359.52 --> 362.88
arrive

360.4 --> 362.88
immediately

363.919 --> 368.15999999999997
i never wanted to say it but i think

365.84 --> 372.08
flat earth needs some kind of a

368.16 --> 373.199
self-promotion uh organization to it

372.08 --> 375.35999999999996
but like i'm doing because they're not

373.199 --> 375.36
gonna

376.0 --> 379.12
yeah that's what nathan is doing right

377.36 --> 380.639
now

379.12 --> 382.639
right but i mean a little bit more

380.639 --> 384.8
organization to it so that other people

382.639 --> 387.919
are doing it as well

384.8 --> 390.16
right that's what i'm trying to achieve

387.919 --> 391.039
yeah yeah it sounds like you're saying

390.16 --> 392.40000000000003
the obvious but

391.039 --> 394.8
yeah that's exactly what i'm trying to

392.4 --> 396.23999999999995
do encourage that type of behavior that

394.8 --> 398.16
mentality

396.24 --> 399.52
so yeah that's exactly what i'm doing

398.16 --> 400.96000000000004
and yeah i'm not going to beat around

399.52 --> 401.75899999999996
the bush i'm doing it so hopefully it

400.96 --> 404.63899999999995
has a positive

401.759 --> 406.16
effect on me you know i'm not obviously

404.639 --> 407.919
it's not the only motivation i want to

406.16 --> 409.12
see these other people grow as well but

407.919 --> 409.919
you know i'm hoping it'll be paid

409.12 --> 412.0
forward and

409.919 --> 414.0
then it'll then it won't directly affect

412.0 --> 415.84
me but hopefully as a brush on effect or

414.0 --> 416.96
however you describe it it'll affect me

415.84 --> 418.08
and the trolls in the comments have

416.96 --> 419.28
immediately picked up on this they're

418.08 --> 420.639
like you're only doing this because you

419.28 --> 423.75899999999996
want to grow your channel i'm like

420.639 --> 426.08
yeah i do and how does that work

423.759 --> 426.96000000000004
well it works when i get shouted out

426.08 --> 428.8
well that means

426.96 --> 430.63899999999995
i can shout out people with lesser

428.8 --> 431.68
channels that haven't got as many

430.639 --> 433.199
subscribers

431.68 --> 434.56
and therefore there's a wider audience

433.199 --> 435.039
that i've got that i can push towards

434.56 --> 436.88
them

435.039 --> 439.199
if i can't encourage just others to do

436.88 --> 440.71999999999997
that for me and hopefully by me doing it

439.199 --> 441.91900000000004
i lead by example and people will

440.72 --> 443.12
actually do it

441.919 --> 445.19899999999996
um anyway i'm just gonna play a little

443.12 --> 446.96
bit

445.199 --> 448.16
and that's a simple plan he's playing

446.96 --> 448.71999999999997
music i bet not i don't know he's

448.16 --> 450.96000000000004
playing

448.72 --> 453.52000000000004
flat earth man uh let's see if i can get

450.96 --> 455.919
to a bit where he's actually talking

453.52 --> 457.84
ask zone so you can get a breath of

455.919 --> 459.84
fresh air in this area

457.84 --> 463.75899999999996
i've just deemed it a sovereign area you

459.84 --> 465.039
know i put the you know holy water

463.759 --> 466.47900000000004
yeah if you want to take your mask off

465.039 --> 469.039
in this area you know you can do it

466.479 --> 473.12
we're outside

469.039 --> 474.96
it's not a loss you get the general gist

473.12 --> 476.479
his ace you got to check him out anyway

474.96 --> 478.71999999999997
i'll put a link to him in the

476.479 --> 480.0
uh in the live stream chat so hopefully

478.72 --> 481.52000000000004
when we actually start live people will

480.0 --> 482.16
see and i'll remind them to go and see

481.52 --> 484.56
that

482.16 --> 486.16
um but yeah that's authentic intent so

484.56 --> 487.52
be here or be severe check him out

486.16 --> 489.199
subscribe today

487.52 --> 491.44
uh have you guys heard of bible

489.199 --> 495.28000000000003
literally

491.44 --> 498.56
yes paula is ace well it is indeed ace

495.28 --> 501.75899999999996
so uh let's just see what shall i

498.56 --> 504.4
grab her most recent live stream maybe

501.759 --> 506.16
stick a share link to that i'm actually

504.4 --> 507.919
labeling these in the live chat

506.16 --> 509.68
i'm sure i can explain that they're

507.919 --> 510.87899999999996
three different links to the people who

509.68 --> 513.76
come along that are

510.879 --> 515.2
members already in this members chat

513.76 --> 520.959
right so there's paula

515.2 --> 522.719
she's also a ball buster

520.959 --> 525.3599999999999
that's her channel check her out be here

522.719 --> 528.0
or be sphere paula is ace

525.36 --> 529.519
she obviously has a bible centric

528.0 --> 531.519
channel if you want to call it that

529.519 --> 534.24
but she's also a flat earther and

531.519 --> 536.0
extremely educated on the subject and

534.24 --> 538.24
she's a historian there's no other way

536.0 --> 539.2
to describe her and she's very good at

538.24 --> 541.839
it so

539.2 --> 543.12
check her out um i'm not a christian i

541.839 --> 544.0
wouldn't call myself a christian but i

543.12 --> 546.88
still watch her channel

544.0 --> 548.0
it's full of informative stuff so

546.88 --> 549.68
definitely check her out

548.0 --> 550.88
it doesn't doesn't necessarily have to

549.68 --> 552.399
be the case that you're a christian to

550.88 --> 553.519
go and watch paul's channel far from it

552.399 --> 555.44
in fact

553.519 --> 557.68
but yeah so it's just useful interesting

555.44 --> 559.6
information from paula on the bible

557.68 --> 561.8389999999999
literalist channel so that's

559.6 --> 563.12
paula's channel link is going to be in

561.839 --> 565.12
the live stream again for when people

563.12 --> 566.8
come along when we're live although this

565.12 --> 568.24
is this is advertised so we might get a

566.8 --> 569.12
few members before we start if they know

568.24 --> 571.6
what time

569.12 --> 575.36
last but by no means least today's

571.6 --> 577.279
promotion will be for flat side fe

575.36 --> 579.2
who is of course the panel owner and his

577.279 --> 581.12
ace so he deserves also to have more

579.2 --> 584.399
than 500 odd subscribers

581.12 --> 587.519
so he's currently in about with craig

584.399 --> 588.64
fight the flat earth hello

587.519 --> 591.839
was that on the video is that you

588.64 --> 591.8389999999999
actually saying that

592.0 --> 598.16
yeah this is flat side effie

595.44 --> 599.0400000000001
and his channel and his most recent

598.16 --> 600.88
video

599.04 --> 602.16
what is a closed system so i've put a

600.88 --> 604.0
link to that as well

602.16 --> 605.36
so he details i had a bit of an issue

604.0 --> 608.24
with the sky and what he said flat sword

605.36 --> 608.24
did you read my comment

608.32 --> 613.0400000000001
yeah i didn't want to really take him up

610.079 --> 615.4399999999999
on the isothermic system

613.04 --> 616.64
isolated systems yet because he couldn't

615.44 --> 618.72
get closed systems

616.64 --> 619.8389999999999
if you're not going to be closest to my

618.72 --> 622.399
you can understand the

619.839 --> 624.5600000000001
isolated system yeah i mean my comment

622.399 --> 626.32
wasn't directed at craig it was directed

624.56 --> 627.8389999999999
at the guy in the video really you know

626.32 --> 628.9590000000001
he's saying an isolated system is

627.839 --> 632.32
represented by a

628.959 --> 634.64
thermos no it isn't

632.32 --> 636.24
yeah yeah they just use it as in

634.64 --> 638.56
theoretical you can call it

636.24 --> 639.6800000000001
yeah a way of explaining his isolated

638.56 --> 642.7199999999999
system yeah he's

639.68 --> 643.68
saying look he isn't in an ideal

642.72 --> 645.36
circumstance

643.68 --> 646.959
he doesn't disclaim any of this but i

645.36 --> 649.92
get what you're saying he could say

646.959 --> 650.88
in an ideal circumstance on paper a

649.92 --> 653.1999999999999
thermos would be

650.88 --> 654.079
considered as an isolated system it's

653.2 --> 655.76
like

654.079 --> 657.12
no thermos exists that you can put a hot

655.76 --> 658.56
drink in and come back 10 years later

657.12 --> 660.0
and it's still hot

658.56 --> 661.5999999999999
it's not an isolated system it's

660.0 --> 664.8
preposterous but in a

661.6 --> 667.0400000000001
and on a blackboard yeah fine whatever

664.8 --> 668.7199999999999
anyway why are we even discussing this

667.04 --> 671.1999999999999
so this is flashlight's channel this is

668.72 --> 675.12
flashlight fp

671.2 --> 677.6800000000001
forget to subscribe

675.12 --> 679.68
so nathan what you're doing is there was

677.68 --> 680.88
a famous commercial i think it was in

679.68 --> 684.0
the 80s

680.88 --> 684.48
i think it was a hair product and they

684.0 --> 686.88
had like

684.48 --> 689.279
in one screen the person and they the

686.88 --> 691.76
main thing is and they told two friends

689.279 --> 693.36
and they told two friends and so on and

691.76 --> 695.12
so on and so on

693.36 --> 696.8000000000001
and then pretty soon the whole screen is

695.12 --> 700.399
filled up with little

696.8 --> 701.519
pictures of that person you familiar

700.399 --> 704.64
with that commercial

701.519 --> 705.04
i'm not but i get the concept yeah it

704.64 --> 706.8
was

705.04 --> 708.399
it was a very famous commercial so what

706.8 --> 709.3599999999999
you're doing is you know you got to tell

708.399 --> 711.12
people and

709.36 --> 713.12
they'll tell people and that's how

711.12 --> 714.72
growth will happen

713.12 --> 716.24
because you're not getting any help from

714.72 --> 719.44
freaking um

716.24 --> 721.2
youtube that's for sure sure but flat

719.44 --> 722.9590000000001
sword can get help from me

721.2 --> 725.279
and that's exactly really easy and then

722.959 --> 728.3199999999999
he'll tell two friends and so on and so

725.279 --> 728.32
on and so on

728.839 --> 732.399
exactly

730.24 --> 734.16
but rather than twerking for subs and

732.399 --> 736.0
asking people to chat me out which was

734.16 --> 738.48
totally unsuccessful nobody even

736.0 --> 739.279
one guy tried your shout out to you my

738.48 --> 741.279
friend

739.279 --> 742.959
he did something um but that was about

741.279 --> 743.68
it and yeah as much as i'm very very

742.959 --> 745.8389999999999
grateful

743.68 --> 747.1999999999999
and as a direct consequence this is why

745.839 --> 748.9590000000001
so trade your

747.2 --> 750.399
chatted me out did a little stream

748.959 --> 753.04
talked about the show

750.399 --> 754.0
and i shouted him out and put a link to

753.04 --> 755.76
his video

754.0 --> 756.959
so it's sort of oh this is symbiotic

755.76 --> 757.6
isn't it so it's like why does it have

756.959 --> 759.4399999999999
to be

757.6 --> 760.48
that way around you know why does it

759.44 --> 761.7600000000001
have to be that i have to go and

760.48 --> 762.639
approach them and say can you shout me

761.76 --> 764.56
out

762.639 --> 765.839
why not i just shout people out and

764.56 --> 767.1999999999999
hopefully you know one day they'll

765.839 --> 769.12
return the favor or someone will

767.2 --> 770.24
see it as a good idea it's content at

769.12 --> 772.72
the end of the day if you're looking

770.24 --> 774.24
as a youtuber to make content it's uh

772.72 --> 775.839
it's content i can trim out

774.24 --> 777.2
put it out as an individual advert for

775.839 --> 778.72
those people and i'm sure they'd be

777.2 --> 780.639
extremely grateful for that

778.72 --> 783.44
but for me it's an extra video right so

780.639 --> 783.44
it's win-win

783.6 --> 787.839
yeah i mean if you're not

788.56 --> 792.4799999999999
yeah many people in the comments were

791.2 --> 793.36
like yeah math parliament worked me up

792.48 --> 794.639
too

793.36 --> 795.6
they're like yeah good because there's

794.639 --> 797.04
gonna be people out there i've never

795.6 --> 798.0
heard of him a few people went and were

797.04 --> 799.68
like there's not a lot of flat earth

798.0 --> 801.76
content on there and i'm like

799.68 --> 803.12
matt matthew's all flat earth but yes he

801.76 --> 805.36
does talk about other subjects

803.12 --> 807.36
and like most recently he's re-released

805.36 --> 808.72
some of his flat earth content

807.36 --> 811.12
and i'm sure he'll carry on talking

808.72 --> 813.519
about the subject so you know

811.12 --> 815.36
his current affairs generally speaking

813.519 --> 818.48
but he's og flat earth

815.36 --> 818.48
so it's worth recommending

819.44 --> 822.72
i think you start to have a problem when

821.199 --> 824.639
everybody starts when they start

822.72 --> 827.44
accusing people of being chills i think

824.639 --> 830.0790000000001
that's the only problem

827.44 --> 832.32
spoken like a true shill very suspicious

830.079 --> 832.3199999999999
of you

833.12 --> 838.32
you know because he can go on he could

834.639 --> 840.8
go on a little uh rant uh

838.32 --> 843.6
boy there we're not here to promote

840.8 --> 846.88
people's failings

843.6 --> 849.839
but he's a great flat earther

846.88 --> 852.56
everyone's got their issues right people

849.839 --> 857.839
all day with anybody

852.56 --> 857.8389999999999
that's not the purpose here

861.279 --> 863.76
so yeah those are the people i'm going

862.399 --> 865.04
to shout out on the live show so try and

863.76 --> 866.88
think of some nice things to say about

865.04 --> 869.5999999999999
them

866.88 --> 872.399
authentic intent bible literalist and

869.6 --> 872.399
flat sword fe

872.88 --> 876.88
well now when you start calling people

874.639 --> 880.48
shills you're divining their intent

876.88 --> 885.8389999999999
right um yeah you die

880.48 --> 885.839
yeah it appeals to motivation policy

888.0 --> 893.519
irrelevant of the argument totally

891.12 --> 896.9590000000001
irrelevant

893.519 --> 898.24
yeah the argument stands no matter what

896.959 --> 900.399
their motivation is

898.24 --> 902.639
okay let's say i prove rumpus is paid by

900.399 --> 903.6
mi6 to come here and infiltrate flat

902.639 --> 906.72
earth and

903.6 --> 910.0790000000001
create disinformation and chaos

906.72 --> 910.0790000000001
does that win me my argument

910.839 --> 915.1990000000001
no

913.68 --> 916.88
no that's what i mean it can't the

915.199 --> 918.0
argument is still going to stand it's

916.88 --> 920.88
got likes

918.0 --> 921.76
yeah we have a black swan we have guests

920.88 --> 923.36
patriotic

921.76 --> 925.519
we have housekeeping questions that

923.36 --> 926.88
cannot be answered and have not been

925.519 --> 930.0
answered

926.88 --> 931.92
yeah and so it shall remain you know

930.0 --> 933.12
we're not living on a sphere therefore

931.92 --> 934.399
anybody who comes here that wants to

933.12 --> 935.519
oppose that is going to find it

934.399 --> 940.56
difficult

935.519 --> 944.079
and that's what gets shown good morning

940.56 --> 947.5999999999999
good morning as for exposing people's

944.079 --> 948.88
lawyers motivation i don't care

947.6 --> 950.32
i don't care what motivates people to

948.88 --> 952.72
believe they're on a spinning sphere

950.32 --> 953.759
flying through a sky vacuum i don't care

952.72 --> 957.279
you want to believe it because you're

953.759 --> 957.279
paid to believe it okay

958.079 --> 961.279
i heard somebody in the comments it

959.519 --> 964.9590000000001
really is good morning for you

961.279 --> 965.4399999999999
what is it 5 45 10. yeah i wake up at

964.959 --> 969.3599999999999
five

965.44 --> 972.0790000000001
yeah i wake up five every day

969.36 --> 972.0790000000001
my day going

973.12 --> 977.6
now that's dedication to the nathan

975.279 --> 980.079
oakley 1980 channel

977.6 --> 980.88
no that's dedication to living in

980.079 --> 983.8389999999999
california

980.88 --> 983.8389999999999
and having a farm

984.48 --> 988.5600000000001
are you still tuned in though yeah well

986.88 --> 990.079
i'm glad i'm here because if it was a

988.56 --> 996.4799999999999
different time zone i may not be able to

990.079 --> 998.4799999999999
get in every day

996.48 --> 1000.639
yeah i was just outside on my porch the

998.48 --> 1006.16
moon looks awesome so i was

1000.639 --> 1006.16
taking some uh p900 pics and videos

1007.92 --> 1012.16
speaking of the move they were talking

1009.519 --> 1013.6
about it on 24 7 discord early this

1012.16 --> 1016.399
morning

1013.6 --> 1018.639
how it's uh terra firma and it has

1016.399 --> 1019.519
craters and some guy was on the channel

1018.639 --> 1022.399
saying

1019.519 --> 1025.28
that his grandmother told him in the 50s

1022.399 --> 1027.199
they shot up rockets and hit the moon

1025.28 --> 1029.439
and that's why these craters and the

1027.199 --> 1030.72
milky way was caused by another rocket

1029.439 --> 1032.4
breaking the dome

1030.72 --> 1034.799
i finally jumped in i'm like hold on

1032.4 --> 1036.16
hold on a second you just have no proof

1034.799 --> 1039.839
that this is

1036.16 --> 1039.8390000000002
even tangible

1044.079 --> 1050.3999999999999
sorry rockets saw it on the telly and

1047.52 --> 1053.44
read it on the newspaper

1050.4 --> 1056.5590000000002
hey brian

1053.44 --> 1056.559
anything hey everyone

1059.52 --> 1062.8799999999999
when i look at it it looks like i could

1061.12 --> 1066.2399999999998
see through it

1062.88 --> 1067.44
but still the fact remains is we've not

1066.24 --> 1069.84
been there we've not

1067.44 --> 1071.919
handled it to see we don't know if it's

1069.84 --> 1072.799
anything we can touch as far as we see

1071.919 --> 1074.96
from here

1072.799 --> 1076.72
it's still a light in the sky that's

1074.96 --> 1078.08
gotta be real they got petrified wood

1076.72 --> 1079.6000000000001
from it

1078.08 --> 1081.4399999999998
that's part of a math pylon skit

1079.6 --> 1083.52
actually so he's talking about

1081.44 --> 1085.1200000000001
people who got the idea that they've

1083.52 --> 1087.28
visited the moon

1085.12 --> 1089.28
and if you think about the timing a lot

1087.28 --> 1090.799
of people didn't have a television

1089.28 --> 1091.43
so the majority of them heard it on the

1090.799 --> 1092.6399999999999
radio

1091.43 --> 1094.88
[Laughter]

1092.64 --> 1096.3200000000002
and the way he puts it into the skit

1094.88 --> 1097.919
like just this

1096.32 --> 1099.6789999999999
just disbelief that people are

1097.919 --> 1102.4
describing how people have landed on the

1099.679 --> 1105.44
moon because they heard it on the radio

1102.4 --> 1105.44
it's just funny

1106.32 --> 1109.84
that's imagination

1111.679 --> 1115.679
nixon said that the american people

1116.0 --> 1120.32
the american people wouldn't believe on

1118.799 --> 1122.24
the news

1120.32 --> 1125.6
again uh john i interrupted you both

1122.24 --> 1128.88
times i'm really sorry hey super mario

1125.6 --> 1128.8799999999999
hey uh

1128.96 --> 1132.32
nixon said that the american people

1130.799 --> 1135.36
wouldn't believe it unless they heard it

1132.32 --> 1135.36
on the 8 o'clock news

1135.76 --> 1138.8799999999999
yeah and it don't matter which format

1137.36 --> 1140.4799999999998
eight o'clock news on the tv eight

1138.88 --> 1140.96
o'clock news on the radio who cares

1140.48 --> 1142.559
right

1140.96 --> 1151.8400000000001
as long as they hear it on the news or

1142.559 --> 1151.84
read it in the paper they'll believe it

1162.96 --> 1166.16
i guess you guys have been paying

1164.64 --> 1168.4
attention to the uh the

1166.16 --> 1170.0
the local pandemic nonsense or have you

1168.4 --> 1172.48
guys switched off from it

1170.0 --> 1173.679
absolutely i've switched off from it so

1172.48 --> 1175.679
what i've been doing

1173.679 --> 1177.6000000000001
for me personally it's like obviously

1175.679 --> 1178.4
flat earth's like my baby my topic but

1177.6 --> 1180.3999999999999
obviously

1178.4 --> 1181.679
this pandemic thing's a big thing for me

1180.4 --> 1183.44
because i

1181.679 --> 1185.2800000000002
our human rights are being violated and

1183.44 --> 1186.64
i don't agree with it so i've obviously

1185.28 --> 1188.559
been fighting the battles in terms of

1186.64 --> 1190.0
human rights and police and protesting

1188.559 --> 1191.36
and all that stuff because

1190.0 --> 1193.6
i believe that we've all got the freedom

1191.36 --> 1195.6
to express our opinions and assemble

1193.6 --> 1196.48
freely without government interference

1195.6 --> 1197.9189999999999
and the government are clearly

1196.48 --> 1198.4
interfering with it and i don't agree

1197.919 --> 1199.679
with it

1198.4 --> 1201.2
so i've been focusing on that at the

1199.679 --> 1202.64
moment recently because it's such an

1201.2 --> 1204.64
important topic for me that

1202.64 --> 1206.0
we can all agree that we can all

1204.64 --> 1208.24
disagree with each other and express

1206.0 --> 1209.44
our opinions without fear of curtailment

1208.24 --> 1212.64
from the state

1209.44 --> 1214.0
but by being out the topic for a while

1212.64 --> 1215.8400000000001
i've been speaking to different people

1214.0 --> 1217.52
about different perspectives relative to

1215.84 --> 1219.1999999999998
coronavirus and all that

1217.52 --> 1220.559
and what i've noticed is that everybody

1219.2 --> 1221.8400000000001
that i've been speaking to

1220.559 --> 1223.84
not only knows that they're not on a

1221.84 --> 1225.6789999999999
live on a spinning ball most of them

1223.84 --> 1227.76
have even heard of nathan oakley

1225.679 --> 1229.76
so even though not being in the topic

1227.76 --> 1232.32
has kind of um broadened my

1229.76 --> 1233.6
horizons as it were it's actually made

1232.32 --> 1235.12
me realize that there's a

1233.6 --> 1236.9599999999998
there's a shitload of people out there

1235.12 --> 1238.559
that know they're not on a spinning ball

1236.96 --> 1240.32
but we're not tapped into that market in

1238.559 --> 1240.6399999999999
any way because of the way it is it's

1240.32 --> 1242.96
just

1240.64 --> 1244.64
segregation and whatever divide whatever

1242.96 --> 1246.4
but loads of people realize that we're

1244.64 --> 1248.0
not on a ball that are in the topic of

1246.4 --> 1250.24
coronavirus that are prepared to

1248.0 --> 1251.679
speak up fight about it and do all the

1250.24 --> 1253.76
protesting stuff

1251.679 --> 1254.72
but they know we're not on a ball but

1253.76 --> 1256.72
they won't come on

1254.72 --> 1257.76
like the topic like and openly talk

1256.72 --> 1258.88
about it because it's obviously

1257.76 --> 1261.039
societally it's not

1258.88 --> 1262.0
not considered to be a cool thing but

1261.039 --> 1263.84
every most people

1262.0 --> 1265.039
i speak to know nathan and they know

1263.84 --> 1266.6399999999999
that went on a ball

1265.039 --> 1268.72
and i just think that it's really cool

1266.64 --> 1270.88
that everybody knows this because

1268.72 --> 1272.4
not only are we not alone we've got way

1270.88 --> 1274.3200000000002
more people that support us

1272.4 --> 1275.6000000000001
indirectly than what you'd ever imagine

1274.32 --> 1276.1589999999999
it's not a little niche area on the

1275.6 --> 1277.76
internet

1276.159 --> 1280.4
everyone knows most people know we're

1277.76 --> 1280.4
not on a ball

1281.28 --> 1286.799
cool very cool yeah that's always yeah

1284.48 --> 1288.24
like athletic nathan earlier every day

1286.799 --> 1289.44
i'm seeing more and more south african

1288.24 --> 1291.2
flat earthers everywhere

1289.44 --> 1292.64
and a lot of them have heard it from

1291.2 --> 1294.799
nathan oakley

1292.64 --> 1296.5590000000002
so you're definitely getting your word

1294.799 --> 1298.799
out there

1296.559 --> 1300.1589999999999
yeah i'd agree it is working and i i'd

1298.799 --> 1301.84
say that the fact that they keep away

1300.159 --> 1303.2
indicates the societal pressure on

1301.84 --> 1306.24
people not to conform

1303.2 --> 1307.919
uh not to um talk about it but the fact

1306.24 --> 1310.08
that i realize that people

1307.919 --> 1311.039
realize that it's not a ball but are

1310.08 --> 1313.28
silent

1311.039 --> 1314.48
then that tells me that there's way more

1313.28 --> 1315.9189999999999
people out there

1314.48 --> 1317.44
it's just incredible how we're

1315.919 --> 1319.1200000000001
pigeonholed into a little corner of the

1317.44 --> 1320.4
internet that's the way we describe it a

1319.12 --> 1321.36
little corner of the internet that no

1320.4 --> 1323.44
one cares about

1321.36 --> 1325.12
no no no no everyone i talk to that's

1323.44 --> 1326.159
got an issue on covid that will speak

1325.12 --> 1327.6789999999999
out about kobit

1326.159 --> 1329.2
knows that we're not on a ball doesn't

1327.679 --> 1330.159
necessarily mean that they do know what

1329.2 --> 1331.3600000000001
we do live on

1330.159 --> 1332.96
but it doesn't mean that they know what

1331.36 --> 1333.52
we don't live on which is the only thing

1332.96 --> 1335.28
that we

1333.52 --> 1336.24
really need to get across the message we

1335.28 --> 1338.48
need to get across because it's

1336.24 --> 1340.64
absolutely true

1338.48 --> 1341.52
very cool thanks for coming on and

to say i was like there's something i

1449.919 --> 1459.8400000000001
should say at this point

1460.4 --> 1466.24
well being realized sorry

1463.919 --> 1467.679
go ahead brian's pictures just come up

1466.24 --> 1469.52
and i've always seen it because he looks

1467.679 --> 1471.3600000000001
like tyson fury in the picture

1469.52 --> 1473.279
but i just know she's got a black swan

1471.36 --> 1474.559
t-shirt on aren't you

1473.279 --> 1477.36
yeah that's why i've shown the whole

1474.559 --> 1477.36
picture yeah

1478.88 --> 1487.1200000000001
god i'm slow yeah that's the point of it

1483.52 --> 1490.799
the black spawn teacher

1487.12 --> 1490.799
he actually looks like tyson fury

1490.88 --> 1493.7600000000002
well when he first came up thinking i'm

1492.4 --> 1494.5590000000002
looking at it and you know your brain

1493.76 --> 1497.36
just

1494.559 --> 1499.44
classifies her fast tyson fury and then

1497.36 --> 1503.279
realizes

1499.44 --> 1504.88
it's brian in his garden yeah i i i'm a

1503.279 --> 1507.279
good nine inches shorter than titan

1504.88 --> 1508.7990000000002
fiori

1507.279 --> 1510.159
yeah i still i don't think i'd argue

1508.799 --> 1511.0
with you brian looking at that picture

1510.159 --> 1512.88
still right

1511.0 --> 1516.4
[Laughter]

1512.88 --> 1517.8400000000001
you does that mean that brian's a

1516.4 --> 1520.48
whipper snapper doesn't mean the tyson

1517.84 --> 1520.48
fury is huge

1525.039 --> 1528.96
here's what pisses me off about these

1526.64 --> 1531.3600000000001
masks i just went into dunkin donuts and

1528.96 --> 1534.88
i practically had to shout

1531.36 --> 1538.559
small coffee cream two sugars

1534.88 --> 1541.679
what large coffee two coffees

1538.559 --> 1544.3999999999999
one freaky coffee cream two sugars it's

1541.679 --> 1546.0
an absolute outrageous

1544.4 --> 1547.76
absolute outrage what is the world

1546.0 --> 1549.52
coming to

1547.76 --> 1550.31
i'm just glad he was on me waiting to do

1549.52 --> 1555.039
that

1550.31 --> 1557.039
[Laughter]

1555.039 --> 1558.1589999999999
we should have a riot just for that i

1557.039 --> 1560.559
mean having to

1558.159 --> 1561.44
speak louder i mean just what's the

1560.559 --> 1564.48
world come to

1561.44 --> 1564.48
it's just disgraceful

1564.799 --> 1568.48
no nathan is not speaking louder you

1566.72 --> 1569.76
gotta shout they got a big freaking

1568.48 --> 1572.0
plexiglass

1569.76 --> 1573.12
in front of you she's got a mask on i

1572.0 --> 1576.559
can't hear her

1573.12 --> 1578.0
i gotta wear a mask she can't hear me

1576.559 --> 1579.76
i'm with you man i'm organizing the

1578.0 --> 1581.2
committee to get this uh all done and

1579.76 --> 1585.84
dusted and we're gonna be on the streets

1581.2 --> 1585.8400000000001
about this neil

1586.799 --> 1590.32
we'll just start walking around with uh

1588.88 --> 1592.7990000000002
with those uh

1590.32 --> 1593.9189999999999
siren horns everywhere be much easier to

1592.799 --> 1595.76
talk

1593.919 --> 1598.0
we should have listened to brian way

1595.76 --> 1600.0
back when he said burn the mask i

1598.0 --> 1603.52
remember that brian

1600.0 --> 1603.52
yeah that's the only way around us

1603.84 --> 1607.6
what this law that's now well and truly

1606.88 --> 1609.44
established

1607.6 --> 1610.7199999999998
for seven or eight months now you think

1609.44 --> 1612.88
that burning a mask will do something

1610.72 --> 1614.88
about

1612.88 --> 1618.0
well if everyone borrowed them then they

1614.88 --> 1618.0
no one will happen to put them on

1618.4 --> 1621.6000000000001
i would just don't know what idealistic

1620.08 --> 1622.72
fellow you are just don't buy any new

1621.6 --> 1625.76
ones then

1622.72 --> 1626.08
i i walked into uh play golf two weeks

1625.76 --> 1629.44
ago

1626.08 --> 1631.1999999999998
i think was two weeks ago and uh

1629.44 --> 1632.64
i'm over there paying for my green fee

1631.2 --> 1634.159
and the guy says

1632.64 --> 1637.039
oh you need a mask and i go i don't

1634.159 --> 1639.919
consent and

1637.039 --> 1640.96
he grabs a mask from behind the counter

1639.919 --> 1643.2
and hands it to me

1640.96 --> 1646.32
so i just grab it i go thanks i paid and

1643.2 --> 1646.32
walked out and never put it

1646.88 --> 1651.8400000000001
exactly i i have to stand outside as a

1650.399 --> 1653.6789999999999
chemist i keep going to

1651.84 --> 1654.8799999999999
there's a couple of good girls walking

1653.679 --> 1655.44
there so that's part of the reason i go

1654.88 --> 1659.44
in there

1655.44 --> 1661.3600000000001
but uh i uh go there and uh

1659.44 --> 1662.799
everyone might go in there or what they

1661.36 --> 1664.559
they think oh you don't have a mask and

1662.799 --> 1665.039
i go no no you have to stand outside the

1664.559 --> 1667.279
door

1665.039 --> 1668.24
okay oh so i stand outside the door like

1667.279 --> 1670.88
i don't mind

1668.24 --> 1672.3990000000001
i if i if someone asked me have you got

1670.88 --> 1673.679
a mask to say no don't wear them

1672.399 --> 1675.4399999999998
did i say if you want me to leave or

1673.679 --> 1680.0
leave no worries

1675.44 --> 1680.0
don't cause anybody i'm not wearing any

1680.84 --> 1683.84
masks

1694.0 --> 1698.399
who doesn't i have to wear a mask

1697.039 --> 1700.96
otherwise i'm going to die

1698.399 --> 1700.9599999999998
spray fumes

1704.72 --> 1711.84
with your carbon filter

1710.0 --> 1713.44
least he's got dangerous fumes that

1711.84 --> 1715.36
actually exist though that will actually

1713.44 --> 1716.799
compromise his health

1715.36 --> 1718.9599999999998
right you're getting dangerously close

1716.799 --> 1720.6399999999999
to getting me a community guideline

1718.96 --> 1724.24
strike now so

1720.64 --> 1727.279
oh are we yeah yeah

1724.24 --> 1729.279
not quite but dangerously close hang on

1727.279 --> 1730.88
nathan let me get a mask for your show

1729.279 --> 1732.64
thanks thanks thank you though i'm

1730.88 --> 1734.159
getting up i'm getting a full out

1732.64 --> 1736.3200000000002
guerrilla warfare

1734.159 --> 1739.8400000000001
going into stores you do that that's

1736.32 --> 1739.84
excellent yeah

1740.399 --> 1743.6789999999999
again we'll apply the censorship

1741.919 --> 1744.24
guidelines and stop talking about it

1743.679 --> 1745.52
otherwise

1744.24 --> 1747.279
we don't we don't we don't want to

1745.52 --> 1748.8799999999999
violate those and get nathan into [ __ ]

1747.279 --> 1749.44
so let's just pretend that everything's

1748.88 --> 1751.6000000000001
okay and

1749.44 --> 1753.8400000000001
we're all happy with our masks come by

1751.6 --> 1755.12
you are

1753.84 --> 1757.039
i'm not wearing a mask i don't know what

1755.12 --> 1760.9599999999998
you're talking about but yes let's all

1757.039 --> 1766.48
come by our hands around the continent

1760.96 --> 1768.96
and all that

1766.48 --> 1770.3990000000001
well to change topic all right guys do

1768.96 --> 1772.0
you know there's people out there that

1770.399 --> 1774.32
believe we live on a spinning

1772.0 --> 1776.559
space pair yeah majority of the rest of

1774.32 --> 1776.559
the world

1777.52 --> 1780.48
i have heard that i didn't believe it

1779.12 --> 1781.6
was actually true until i come across

1780.48 --> 1783.2
them in this topic and now they're

1781.6 --> 1784.6399999999999
everywhere

1783.2 --> 1786.24
but no they're not getting censored by

1784.64 --> 1787.76
the censorship it's ridiculous

1786.24 --> 1789.52
i thought they stopped all the facts the

1787.76 --> 1791.84
false facts being passed around like

1789.52 --> 1793.36
like what they believe yeah they put

1791.84 --> 1795.039
them in the education system

1793.36 --> 1797.52
and all the movies and all the

1795.039 --> 1800.799
propaganda they can get their hands on

1797.52 --> 1800.799
they do they do

1802.159 --> 1806.3990000000001
yeah you're right you're a coriolis

1805.2 --> 1808.96
thing with rumpus

1806.399 --> 1809.6789999999999
the what was it the greatest um toe tag

1808.96 --> 1811.279
ever

1809.679 --> 1813.919
it was brilliant last night i was

1811.279 --> 1816.96
listening to it as a sleep

1813.919 --> 1819.2
brilliant i did

1816.96 --> 1820.88
chuckle quite a bit towards it i was

1819.2 --> 1824.24
proper giggling

1820.88 --> 1824.24
you [ __ ] obviously

1825.6 --> 1828.8799999999999
i didn't used to use that that's because

1826.96 --> 1830.24
of anthony he was like he started using

1828.88 --> 1832.64
it i'm like is that offensive

1830.24 --> 1834.08
he was certainly offensive in the 80s

1832.64 --> 1835.44
yeah and then

1834.08 --> 1837.6789999999999
you look it up and it's just a

1835.44 --> 1840.96
derogatory insult right so it's like

1837.679 --> 1841.76
an insult yes and it also means

1840.96 --> 1843.679
incompetent

1841.76 --> 1845.279
now given that rumpus claims to be some

1843.679 --> 1847.1200000000001
kind of oracle with physics and he

1845.279 --> 1848.72
doesn't understand how pendulums work

1847.12 --> 1850.399
to be fair i felt sorry for him because

1848.72 --> 1851.6000000000001
he said that he rotates right

1850.399 --> 1852.8799999999999
you were saying backwards and forth

1851.6 --> 1853.84
backwards and forth and he said that

1852.88 --> 1856.0800000000002
they rotate

1853.84 --> 1858.08
in like an ellipse what he meant to say

1856.08 --> 1859.6789999999999
was the oscillate as they do the back

1858.08 --> 1861.36
and forth that's what he really meant to

1859.679 --> 1862.3990000000001
say but he didn't say it nathan just

1861.36 --> 1864.9599999999998
batted him because of it

1862.399 --> 1864.9599999999998
it was so

1869.12 --> 1872.08
i know what he meant to say but he just

1870.559 --> 1873.519
didn't have that word at that moment and

1872.08 --> 1874.0
nathan batted him because of it and it

1873.519 --> 1876.88
was just

1874.0 --> 1878.0
brilliant why why do these people that

1876.88 --> 1882.48
claim to know physics so

1878.0 --> 1882.48
well actually show they know nothing

1883.519 --> 1887.919
because they would rather say they would

1885.919 --> 1889.679
rather confuse the topic by

1887.919 --> 1891.2
arguing about a nonsense point and

1889.679 --> 1893.3600000000001
accept that there's a contradiction in

1891.2 --> 1895.6000000000001
terms like you see it with like um

1893.36 --> 1897.4399999999998
like i mean did you watch uh flat side

1895.6 --> 1898.9599999999998
against fight the flat earth recently

1897.44 --> 1900.559
he got fight the flat earth to admit

1898.96 --> 1902.96
that he thinks that we live in a con

1900.559 --> 1903.6
in a closed system because he thinks

1902.96 --> 1905.2
because he knows

1903.6 --> 1907.1999999999998
in an open system there would be no gas

1905.2 --> 1908.64
pressure right so he's got to argue that

1907.2 --> 1911.1200000000001
a closed system

1908.64 --> 1911.679
is what we actually live in but that

1911.12 --> 1914.9599999999998
system

1911.679 --> 1916.799
allows small amounts of matter to escape

1914.96 --> 1918.48
well that's a direct contradiction but

1916.799 --> 1919.84
he needs small amounts of matter to

1918.48 --> 1920.72
escape because he needs rockets to be

1919.84 --> 1922.6399999999999
able to leave

1920.72 --> 1924.24
and he needs the you know tons of helium

1922.64 --> 1925.2
and hydrogen that are lost to space

1924.24 --> 1927.84
every day

1925.2 --> 1929.919
he needs those things to exist right so

1927.84 --> 1930.8799999999999
he has to argue that a closed system is

1929.919 --> 1932.64
actually open

1930.88 --> 1934.0800000000002
in complete contradiction to the

1932.64 --> 1949.8400000000001
definitions of what closed and open

1934.08 --> 1949.84
systems actually are

1951.43 --> 1971.21

got something wrong with his thumb or

2218.96 --> 2223.68
he's inhaled a load of toxic nonsense

2221.599 --> 2225.44
but nevertheless

2223.68 --> 2227.839
he's currently in a back and forth with

uh fight the flat earth in regards to

2288.48 --> 2292.16
flat sword

2290.0 --> 2296.32
i got something out on flat side spider

2292.16 --> 2296.3199999999997
bites do not keep him away from the show

2297.119 --> 2302.88
well in joke flat sword was afflicted by

2300.24 --> 2302.8799999999997
a spider bite

2304.0 --> 2309.28
and swelled to the size of a a melon

2307.44 --> 2310.4
it was it wasn't a pleasant sight when i

2309.28 --> 2311.2000000000003
saw the photo it's not something

2310.4 --> 2313.599
currency

2311.2 --> 2315.7599999999998
should we get on with housekeeping i was

2313.599 --> 2317.92
gonna say since that bite his content on

2315.76 --> 2318.55
the web has gotten better

2317.92 --> 2322.35
boom boom

2318.55 --> 2322.3500000000004
[Laughter]

2323.92 --> 2328.56
i just um quickly give paula a shout out

2327.119 --> 2331.28
bible literalist i

2328.56 --> 2331.92
really enjoy a channel it's a something

2331.28 --> 2335.0400000000004
to refer

2331.92 --> 2338.32
you don't see a lot of good quality just

2335.04 --> 2340.4
and you see lots of alternative views of

2338.32 --> 2344.079
biblical stuff but it's good to

2340.4 --> 2346.48
have that solid reference point that

2344.079 --> 2347.3590000000004
i i find quite refreshing to go back and

2346.48 --> 2350.48
listen to a lot of

2347.359 --> 2352.7999999999997
stuff but on a sunday um

2350.48 --> 2354.4
john i mean so yeah big shout out to

2352.8 --> 2355.92
paula i do do like her stuff and as

2354.4 --> 2358.1600000000003
nathan said to me

2355.92 --> 2360.079
excellently researched it's it's all

2358.16 --> 2362.48
secondary

2360.079 --> 2364.079
it's one of those things i sit and watch

2362.48 --> 2366.32
with the family

2364.079 --> 2367.599
in the in the confidence that i don't

2366.32 --> 2369.76
need to ever

2367.599 --> 2372.1600000000003
interject with what paul is saying and

2369.76 --> 2373.44
say well actually that might not be true

2372.16 --> 2376.0789999999997
because there's nothing that she covers

2373.44 --> 2377.599
that isn't impeccably researched

2376.079 --> 2379.3590000000004
so literally on a sunday probably same

2377.599 --> 2381.04
as you adam i don't often chat in the

2379.359 --> 2382.16
comments i just leave it running while

2381.04 --> 2383.2
normally we're cooking dinner and stuff

2382.16 --> 2386.0
but the whole family sit around and

2383.2 --> 2386.0
watch paula's show

2387.28 --> 2390.5600000000004
i'm i'm generally quite in chat if i'm

2389.119 --> 2393.599
listening

2390.56 --> 2395.359
anyway yeah yeah if you i mean i would

2393.599 --> 2396.4
say i don't really concentrate if i'm

2395.359 --> 2398.4
typing so

2396.4 --> 2401.599
when i'm listening i mean you have to

2398.4 --> 2403.92
really engage with what you're saying so

2401.599 --> 2406.88
right i like to get in her chat too

2403.92 --> 2408.319
sometimes if i pick up that she's life

2406.88 --> 2410.88
because i don't know she's very

2408.319 --> 2415.04
inspiring and insightful she like

2410.88 --> 2417.28
she knows so much it's creepy almost

2415.04 --> 2418.8
but it's good i just can't believe she's

2417.28 --> 2420.4
got such a little

2418.8 --> 2422.4
little subscribers i thought she'd have

2420.4 --> 2423.6800000000003
a lot more by now

2422.4 --> 2425.04
she should and that's exactly why i'm

2423.68 --> 2425.68
doing this same goes for authentic

2425.04 --> 2428.16
intent

2425.68 --> 2429.359
so authentic intent i do participate in

2428.16 --> 2430.64
his live stream because he's

2429.359 --> 2432.4
a bit like irwin in the respect that

2430.64 --> 2433.7599999999998
he's very interactive but he's out in

2432.4 --> 2436.2400000000002
the field interactive

2433.76 --> 2437.44
as in face to face with people although

2436.24 --> 2439.04
he doesn't necessarily put their faces

2437.44 --> 2440.079
on camera he just sets up his camera

2439.04 --> 2441.599
starts his live stream

2440.079 --> 2443.92
chats to the chat and then as people

2441.599 --> 2446.6400000000003
float on by he'll just talk to them

2443.92 --> 2448.56
about whatever you know often flat earth

2446.64 --> 2450.64
often current events but he'll you know

2448.56 --> 2452.319
he's very approachable guy

2450.64 --> 2453.68
so yeah i mean all of these characters

2452.319 --> 2455.7599999999998
you couldn't get any more different

2453.68 --> 2458.0
between authentic intent and flat side

2455.76 --> 2459.5200000000004
you know the polar ends of the spectrum

2458.0 --> 2461.359
in terms of what they do

2459.52 --> 2462.56
um but yeah on the same exact subjects

2461.359 --> 2463.359
right they're both covering the same

2462.56 --> 2465.2
stuff

2463.359 --> 2466.64
um but yeah you couldn't recommend three

2465.2 --> 2469.7599999999998
more different people

2466.64 --> 2472.8799999999997
in terms of flat side josh and paula you

2469.76 --> 2472.88
know you couldn't get any more different

2473.92 --> 2480.0
anyway let's do some more subscribe

2477.0 --> 2482.88
great again

2480.0 --> 2484.319
subscribe today subscribe today indeed

2482.88 --> 2485.76
and let them know i sent you nathan

2484.319 --> 2487.2799999999997
oakley 1980 sent us

2485.76 --> 2488.96
let's do some housekeeping eight minutes

2487.28 --> 2491.119
into the live show any evidence of

2488.96 --> 2495.839
physical geometric sphere edge

2491.119 --> 2495.839
horizon formerly known as earth curve

2496.319 --> 2500.24
horizon is an optical phenomena there's

2498.16 --> 2502.0
no geometric edge you couldn't ascertain

2500.24 --> 2503.839
or believe that there ever was one

2502.0 --> 2505.119
unless you could demonstrate it and at

2503.839 --> 2507.92
no point would you ever know that there

2505.119 --> 2508.7200000000003
was one because it's always optical

2507.92 --> 2511.76
sorry

2508.72 --> 2513.4399999999996
so are they stating that uh this angular

2511.76 --> 2515.6800000000003
resolution limit would be this actual

2513.44 --> 2517.119
curve

2515.68 --> 2519.52
the angular resolution limit thing is

2517.119 --> 2521.6800000000003
quite i like the although it was mined

2519.52 --> 2523.28
it just came up naturally with the hair

2521.68 --> 2524.56
i can't remember what we were talking to

2523.28 --> 2525.76
at the time but it's like why doesn't

2524.56 --> 2529.52
her hair disappear

2525.76 --> 2531.8390000000004
at eight inches per mile per mile

2529.52 --> 2532.56
per mile square that was shaky nike

2531.839 --> 2534.88
right

2532.56 --> 2537.7599999999998
so it's like okay so you say stomach

2534.88 --> 2542.4
will disappear at eight inches

2537.76 --> 2544.4
at a mile well okay if that's the case

2542.4 --> 2546.48
a hair will only disappear at eight

2544.4 --> 2548.4
miles a mile rather

2546.48 --> 2551.119
an eight inch hair get it right in the

2548.4 --> 2553.2000000000003
end well if that's the case

2551.119 --> 2554.8
why would it disappear sooner and

2553.2 --> 2556.7999999999997
according to their maths it wouldn't

2554.8 --> 2558.5600000000004
disappear sooner it would disappear

2556.8 --> 2560.88
behind earth curve

2558.56 --> 2561.92
when it got too small to see but in the

2560.88 --> 2565.44
case of a hair

2561.92 --> 2568.16
you're not only limited by the deck

2565.44 --> 2569.92
it's narrow as well so it's angular

2568.16 --> 2573.92
resolution limits affected far

2569.92 --> 2575.44
sooner than a brick that's quite wide

2573.92 --> 2577.359
that's only going to be limited by the

2575.44 --> 2578.4
angle against the deck being the most

2577.359 --> 2580.24
limited angle

2578.4 --> 2582.2400000000002
causing the diffraction limit to arrive

2580.24 --> 2585.5989999999997
sooner well hair

2582.24 --> 2588.16
it could disappear at six feet

2585.599 --> 2589.52
in a mile not accounted for an earth

2588.16 --> 2590.7999999999997
curve maths that hair is only going to

2589.52 --> 2592.48
be disappearing

2590.8 --> 2594.48
when it gets to the horizon they reifies

2592.48 --> 2596.0
a physical sphere edge obstruction

2594.48 --> 2597.68
then they'll calculate mathematically

2596.0 --> 2599.92
with it being an eight inch hair

2597.68 --> 2601.44
at a million miles doesn't matter how

2599.92 --> 2602.88
far or near you are to the eight inch

2601.44 --> 2603.52
hair it's always eight inches in there

2602.88 --> 2607.839
maths

2603.52 --> 2611.599
doesn't have any angular size

2607.839 --> 2614.319
shout out to mario knows it's flat

2611.599 --> 2615.3590000000004
it says shout out to wakey wakey he's

2614.319 --> 2618.48
moving

2615.359 --> 2619.839
over to library tv

2618.48 --> 2621.76
yeah i did see his update he's had a

2619.839 --> 2623.599
couple of uh community guidelines

2621.76 --> 2625.6800000000003
strikes for videos on his

2623.599 --> 2627.28
coverage of current affairs current

2625.68 --> 2629.68
affairs is being

2627.28 --> 2631.119
used as code now it seems anyway current

2629.68 --> 2631.7599999999998
affairs yeah he's covering current

2631.119 --> 2635.52
affairs and

2631.76 --> 2638.8
that's not loud so yeah

2635.52 --> 2638.8
shout out to wakey wakey

2641.44 --> 2645.28
any evidence of axial rotation of the

2643.2 --> 2648.48
earth-based variety

2645.28 --> 2650.1600000000003
no but the accident there was

2648.48 --> 2652.96
planes will get faster when they fly

2650.16 --> 2655.2799999999997
west and they will get slower in in

2652.96 --> 2656.88
time when they fly east but we don't see

2655.28 --> 2658.2400000000002
that yet we're expected to believe that

2656.88 --> 2659.76
a focus pendulum

2658.24 --> 2661.68
proves that the earth turns underneath

2659.76 --> 2662.88
it whilst it's spinning it's complete

2661.68 --> 2665.7599999999998
nonsense

2662.88 --> 2667.76
sorry actually me and solo were in a

2665.76 --> 2670.5600000000004
debate and for like 11 almost 11 last

2667.76 --> 2672.5600000000004
night with standing on this exact topic

2670.56 --> 2674.319
he was trying to say his hypothesis is

2672.56 --> 2677.839
scientific with esther

2674.319 --> 2677.839
it was the most hilarious thing

2680.079 --> 2683.28
people have no idea what science is can

2682.0 --> 2684.319
you can you turn your line up a little

2683.28 --> 2686.079
bit anthony i

2684.319 --> 2687.359
can't take individual control of you in

2686.079 --> 2689.44
the hangout but if you continue

2687.359 --> 2691.52
turn your output line up up a bit that'd

2689.44 --> 2694.079
be very handy

2691.52 --> 2694.079
wouldn't uh

2694.72 --> 2701.2799999999997
with an axial rotation involve uh the

2697.92 --> 2702.079
15 degree deviation yeah 15 degrees

2701.28 --> 2704.7200000000003
drift

2702.079 --> 2706.5600000000004
that's things moving apart at 15 degrees

2704.72 --> 2708.24
an hour as earth rotates underneath

2706.56 --> 2710.319
so that would involve earth rotating

2708.24 --> 2712.4799999999996
underneath

2710.319 --> 2713.68
would that mean you need more than one

2712.48 --> 2716.839
reference frame

2713.68 --> 2718.0789999999997
yeah two one rotating underneath the

2716.839 --> 2720.4
other

2718.079 --> 2721.52
so cause and effect why don't we see uh

2720.4 --> 2725.2000000000003
15 degree

2721.52 --> 2725.2
uh drift

2725.52 --> 2729.119
because you and your reference frames

2726.96 --> 2730.88
have been ruined there are no

2729.119 --> 2732.56
separate reference frames there is no

2730.88 --> 2734.0
earth turning underneath we don't

2732.56 --> 2735.7599999999998
observe coriolis deflection

2734.0 --> 2737.119
nothing flies away from us at a thousand

2735.76 --> 2740.0
miles an hour on the equator that would

2737.119 --> 2743.119
be 15 degrees

2740.0 --> 2745.2
so one word so when we're talking to a

2743.119 --> 2746.7200000000003
baller and we say okay if you say earth

2745.2 --> 2749.52
is spinning at the different

2746.72 --> 2750.16
rates at the different latitudes then

2749.52 --> 2752.48
anything

2750.16 --> 2753.359
unattached to the earth will seem to

2752.48 --> 2756.0
deviate

2753.359 --> 2757.04
and drift so let's throw this ball up in

2756.0 --> 2759.359
the air

2757.04 --> 2760.88
and see how much it drifts away from us

2759.359 --> 2762.319
because we're turning underneath it and

2760.88 --> 2763.359
it comes right back down in the palm of

2762.319 --> 2765.92
your hands

2763.359 --> 2768.24
so so much for your earth spinning right

2765.92 --> 2768.2400000000002
right

2768.96 --> 2772.4
have you ever seen those videos of those

2770.64 --> 2774.0789999999997
guys firing bullets up in the desert

2772.4 --> 2775.44
they fire a couple of bullets with some

2774.079 --> 2777.3590000000004
kind of assault rifle

2775.44 --> 2778.8
they get it as like as straight up as

2777.359 --> 2780.319
they can get it and they go ping ping

2778.8 --> 2781.04
ping fire three bullets up and then

2780.319 --> 2782.48
about

2781.04 --> 2784.64
two minutes later you can hear them come

2782.48 --> 2786.2400000000002
back down and land in the time that the

2784.64 --> 2787.92
earth should have moved it like in that

2786.24 --> 2788.64
distance if it was really traveling the

2787.92 --> 2790.319
way that they

2788.64 --> 2792.319
or if the earth was really turning the

2790.319 --> 2793.68
way they say then bullets would never

2792.319 --> 2795.119
come back anywhere near them because the

2793.68 --> 2797.2
earth would have rotated in the

2795.119 --> 2798.8
over the distance that they require in

2797.2 --> 2800.319
that time such a

2798.8 --> 2801.92
distance and you'd never get the bullets

2800.319 --> 2802.96
back but they pretty much fall pretty

2801.92 --> 2805.359
much back to where they

2802.96 --> 2807.119
get they were fired from yeah i think

2805.359 --> 2808.319
the one bullet was like 20 meters from

2807.119 --> 2810.1600000000003
him or something

2808.319 --> 2811.44
and that's because that wasn't the

2810.16 --> 2813.44
window

2811.44 --> 2814.64
i saw that be ready to laughter there

2813.44 --> 2816.16
are a couple of characters

2814.64 --> 2819.2799999999997
running hiding under the car and the

2816.16 --> 2820.7999999999997
table and everything

2819.28 --> 2822.7200000000003
yeah at that point normally in the

2820.8 --> 2824.319
discussion we have a globe earth tell us

2822.72 --> 2826.3999999999996
the justification for why the bullet

2824.319 --> 2827.68
doesn't drift when they claim earth

2826.4 --> 2829.04
turns underneath

2827.68 --> 2830.7999999999997
now at the moment they don't seem to

2829.04 --> 2832.8
like us pointing out that their claim of

2830.8 --> 2834.8
coriolis drift they'd much prefer it's

2832.8 --> 2837.92
just left called that coriolis rift

2834.8 --> 2839.8390000000004
or 15 degrees now deviation us

2837.92 --> 2841.119
calling it what it really is the claim

2839.839 --> 2843.7599999999998
that earth turns

2841.119 --> 2844.88
underneath stuff attached and then

2843.76 --> 2847.2000000000003
detached

2844.88 --> 2848.079
from the spinning reference frame that

2847.2 --> 2850.96
would be

2848.079 --> 2852.7200000000003
to observe coriolis deflection now they

2850.96 --> 2854.96
don't like us detailing it in that way

2852.72 --> 2856.839
what earth turning underneath things not

2854.96 --> 2858.48
attached apparently that's a sloppy

2856.839 --> 2859.92
description

2858.48 --> 2861.44
other than it being precisely what's

2859.92 --> 2862.319
required for coriolis effect to actually

2861.44 --> 2864.0
happen

2862.319 --> 2865.2799999999997
they don't like it because it's overtly

2864.0 --> 2873.52
stating that we should be turning

2865.28 --> 2877.76
underneath stuff and we're not

2873.52 --> 2880.72
well what they also will do is say

2877.76 --> 2883.0400000000004
like a come virus they'll say

2880.72 --> 2886.0789999999997
conservation of momentum

2883.04 --> 2887.04
the problem is that it's possible that

2886.079 --> 2888.8
exclamation

2887.04 --> 2890.079
could work if the earth was moving

2888.8 --> 2892.48
linear linearly

2890.079 --> 2894.0
in a straight line well it's not

2892.48 --> 2897.92
according to their model

2894.0 --> 2901.04
it's moving angularly in a circular path

2897.92 --> 2903.76
and if you and i don't

2901.04 --> 2905.2
you know claim to understand all the

2903.76 --> 2907.3590000000004
physics behind it

2905.2 --> 2909.2
if you have just a basic understanding

2907.359 --> 2910.88
of those momentums

2909.2 --> 2913.5989999999997
if you're on a moving platform and you

2910.88 --> 2915.92
throw throw a ball straight up the ball

2913.599 --> 2918.079
will tend to come back down into your

2915.92 --> 2920.4
hand where it left however

2918.079 --> 2921.599
if you do that same thing on a spinning

2920.4 --> 2923.6800000000003
platform

2921.599 --> 2924.6400000000003
it won't come back down into your hand

2923.68 --> 2926.48
you can do this

2924.64 --> 2928.48
a couple of ways if you're on a if

2926.48 --> 2929.92
you're on a merry-go-round

2928.48 --> 2931.839
and you're sitting on the edge with your

2929.92 --> 2933.839
feet dangling off the side

2931.839 --> 2936.0789999999997
you can throw a ball either straight out

2933.839 --> 2936.64
and it won't continue to to spin around

2936.079 --> 2938.88
with you

2936.64 --> 2941.04
or you can throw a ball straight up and

2938.88 --> 2944.559
it also won't continue to spin with you

2941.04 --> 2946.88
so a whole argument of of conservation

2944.559 --> 2949.119
of momentum on a spinning ball

2946.88 --> 2950.96
based on just basic physics is out the

2949.119 --> 2953.359
window immediately

2950.96 --> 2954.7200000000003
and that explanation would be a

2953.359 --> 2957.52
justification for having

2954.72 --> 2959.359
no 15 degrees an hour drift if it's

2957.52 --> 2961.839
conserving momentum as they claim

2959.359 --> 2963.04
then it's not coriolis because coriolis

2961.839 --> 2965.44
is only ever observed

2963.04 --> 2967.2
by you on a spinning platform and it's

2965.44 --> 2969.839
an observation of stuff that's not

2967.2 --> 2971.7599999999998
spinning with you so your observation of

2969.839 --> 2973.2
its in your example with a ball thrown

2971.76 --> 2974.48
off a merry-go-round

2973.2 --> 2976.0789999999997
it would be your observation of it

2974.48 --> 2977.52
seeming to curve away from you as you

2976.079 --> 2979.8390000000004
spin away from it

2977.52 --> 2981.839
but for that effect to happen coriolis

2979.839 --> 2982.5589999999997
deflection what they claim proves earth

2981.839 --> 2986.0789999999997
spinning

2982.559 --> 2988.559
15 degrees of drift as earth turns

2986.079 --> 2989.119
underneath stuff not attached like your

2988.559 --> 2991.6800000000003
ball

2989.119 --> 2993.28
isn't attached to the merry-go-round

2991.68 --> 2994.5589999999997
well to have choreos you've got to be

2993.28 --> 2997.0400000000004
observing stuff

2994.559 --> 2998.0
seem to drift so as soon as you detail

2997.04 --> 3000.88
what's happening with the

2998.0 --> 3002.559
ball conserving momentum nothing to do

3000.88 --> 3004.0
with coriolis deflection

3002.559 --> 3006.6400000000003
because that's you observing it seem to

3004.0 --> 3008.079
drift so i don't care from now on when

3006.64 --> 3009.5989999999997
they start justifying how it doesn't

3008.079 --> 3010.6400000000003
drift and why it doesn't drift because

3009.599 --> 3012.079
they need it to drift

3010.64 --> 3014.64
they need earth to turn underneath it

3012.079 --> 3014.6400000000003
and it doesn't

3015.2 --> 3018.8799999999997
hold on a second if i'm on one of them

3017.2 --> 3019.68
moving like in the airport one of them

3018.88 --> 3022.1600000000003
moving

3019.68 --> 3023.7599999999998
sidewalks and i throw a ball straight up

3022.16 --> 3024.3999999999996
in the air it's gonna come back down in

3023.76 --> 3027.5200000000004
my hand

3024.4 --> 3029.6800000000003
i don't think so no but they claim earth

3027.52 --> 3030.96
wouldn't have the same effect so they

3029.68 --> 3031.44
claim that you throw a ball up in the

3030.96 --> 3032.96
air

3031.44 --> 3034.7200000000003
and because it's left a non-inertial

3032.96 --> 3035.599
spinning reference frame you'd see it

3034.72 --> 3037.5989999999997
drift

3035.599 --> 3039.28
like a football in neil degrasse tyson's

3037.599 --> 3040.0
example that was claimed to drift

3039.28 --> 3041.8390000000004
because it's claimed

3040.0 --> 3044.079
earth was turning underneath it so they

3041.839 --> 3045.839
claim earth turns underneath footballs

3044.079 --> 3047.8390000000004
we also get told here in the debate that

3045.839 --> 3049.2
snipers have to concern themselves

3047.839 --> 3050.72
because earth's turning underneath their

3049.2 --> 3053.7599999999998
bullets

3050.72 --> 3054.0
well that is backed by facalt's claim

3053.76 --> 3056.1600000000003
that

3054.0 --> 3058.16
earth is turning underneath the pendulum

3056.16 --> 3061.04
pendulum swings back and forth

3058.16 --> 3061.7599999999998
back and forth back and forth and it's

3061.04 --> 3064.0
claimed to

3061.76 --> 3065.92
seem to drift and knock dominoes over

3064.0 --> 3066.96
because it's claimed earth turns

3065.92 --> 3068.8
underneath

3066.96 --> 3071.52
so they very much on the globe side

3068.8 --> 3073.76
claim earth turns underneath stuff not

3071.52 --> 3075.2
attached at 15 degrees an hour

3073.76 --> 3076.88
but that means earth's turning

3075.2 --> 3079.1189999999997
underneath stuff not attached

3076.88 --> 3080.559
at 15 degrees an hour and that would

3079.119 --> 3082.319
shorten flight times

3080.559 --> 3083.92
that mean a ball would fly away from you

3082.319 --> 3085.04
a thousand miles an hour on the equator

3083.92 --> 3086.559
it would mean that a drone that's

3085.04 --> 3088.5589999999997
hovering would appear to drift away from

3086.559 --> 3091.6800000000003
you a thousand miles an hour

3088.559 --> 3091.6800000000003
and that doesn't happen

3092.0 --> 3096.64
when they say conservation momentum

3095.04 --> 3098.319
they could never have experienced

3096.64 --> 3100.48
coriolis in the first place

3098.319 --> 3102.48
precisely quick shout out to guns of

3100.48 --> 3102.88
navarone rmp who's joined as a penguin

3102.48 --> 3105.2
and then

3102.88 --> 3106.2400000000002
immediately upgraded to a hyena so thank

3105.2 --> 3108.72
you very much indeed for joining us

3106.24 --> 3110.64
channel member

3108.72 --> 3112.0789999999997
well then i think we got to stop pushing

3110.64 --> 3115.359
it that it's it's a it's an

3112.079 --> 3116.0
optical effect yeah it is an optical

3115.359 --> 3119.7599999999998
effect

3116.0 --> 3119.76
that's literally what it's defined as

3119.839 --> 3125.68
as an illusion according to their own

3122.839 --> 3128.64
narrative well it's an optical illusion

3125.68 --> 3129.7599999999998
it doesn't really care yeah the optical

3128.64 --> 3130.72
illusion is that if you're on a

3129.76 --> 3132.559
roundabout and

3130.72 --> 3134.24
the roundabout has got say some trees

3132.559 --> 3136.48
hanging over the top of it

3134.24 --> 3137.68
you know kids playground tree growing

3136.48 --> 3139.68
over the top of a roundabout seems

3137.68 --> 3141.44
reasonable right you come back after the

3139.68 --> 3142.16
lock down and all the trees have

3141.44 --> 3143.28
overgrown

3142.16 --> 3146.0789999999997
and they're hanging over the top of the

3143.28 --> 3147.8390000000004
roundabout now you get on the roundabout

3146.079 --> 3150.1600000000003
on the other side where it's not covered

3147.839 --> 3152.7999999999997
by trees and you start spinning

3150.16 --> 3154.96
and what you see is oh no the tree is

3152.8 --> 3156.6400000000003
coming towards me

3154.96 --> 3158.16
now trees don't get up out of the ground

3156.64 --> 3159.52
and come towards you do they but it

3158.16 --> 3160.7999999999997
looks like it when you're spinning

3159.52 --> 3163.28
towards it

3160.8 --> 3164.96
it looks like the tree's coming towards

3163.28 --> 3166.88
you that's coriolis effect

3164.96 --> 3169.839
it looking like a tree's coming towards

3166.88 --> 3171.359
you really you're spinning towards it

3169.839 --> 3174.7999999999997
and that's what's claimed to happen on

3171.359 --> 3177.2799999999997
earth so stuff that's not attached would

3174.8 --> 3178.2400000000002
seem to drift away or seem to drift

3177.28 --> 3180.8
towards you

3178.24 --> 3183.4399999999996
as you spin towards it rotating

3180.8 --> 3184.4
underneath it that's what coriolis is

3183.44 --> 3186.4
now as soon as we get into the

3184.4 --> 3188.0
nitty-gritty of us declaring what

3186.4 --> 3189.92
they're supposed to be claiming

3188.0 --> 3191.52
that's earth turning underneath at 15

3189.92 --> 3194.8
degrees an hour they go no no

3191.52 --> 3196.319
no no no no that's a sloppy description

3194.8 --> 3197.92
it's not a sloppy description it's just

3196.319 --> 3201.119
coriolis effect and it's claimed to

3197.92 --> 3201.119
happen on earth it just doesn't

3202.88 --> 3207.2000000000003
call the conservation of angular

3205.76 --> 3209.8390000000004
momentum

3207.2 --> 3210.72
uh wouldn't work even if it was linear

3209.839 --> 3213.92
momentum

3210.72 --> 3217.1189999999997
because gas will not attach itself

3213.92 --> 3218.2400000000002
to a moving object correct but it

3217.119 --> 3220.48
wouldn't give you drift

3218.24 --> 3221.4399999999996
what's an interesting concept not saying

3220.48 --> 3222.72
this is true but

3221.44 --> 3224.079
you know when you're describing someone

3222.72 --> 3225.5989999999997
that looks like it's coming towards you

3224.079 --> 3227.52
then moving away from you coming towards

3225.599 --> 3229.2000000000003
you and moving away from you

3227.52 --> 3231.7599999999998
imagine you know like when they talk

3229.2 --> 3233.839
about mercury and venus in retrograde

3231.76 --> 3236.079
they have apparent retrograde motion

3233.839 --> 3238.0789999999997
well if you were on a rotating something

3236.079 --> 3240.079
or orbiting something or whatever you

3238.079 --> 3241.8390000000004
would see all the planets appear to do

3240.079 --> 3243.76
retrograde motion but you don't see all

3241.839 --> 3244.64
the planets do it the only you only see

3243.76 --> 3246.079
those two

3244.64 --> 3248.48
but you could interpret apparent

3246.079 --> 3249.2000000000003
retrograde motion as coriolis force or

3248.48 --> 3250.8
effect

3249.2 --> 3252.319
not saying it is but that would be the

3250.8 --> 3253.92
phenomena that you would have to see but

3252.319 --> 3255.359
relative to other things in the in the

3253.92 --> 3256.0
environment that we live in but we don't

3255.359 --> 3257.7599999999998
see it

3256.0 --> 3259.44
not exactly what you're describing is

3257.76 --> 3260.7200000000003
two different orbital motions described

3259.44 --> 3262.4
in their model that would give you a

3260.72 --> 3262.9599999999996
waltzer-like effect right with two

3262.4 --> 3265.6800000000003
different

3262.96 --> 3266.4
rotational motions happening at once and

3265.68 --> 3269.04
that would

3266.4 --> 3270.8
manifest in this retrograde motion that

3269.04 --> 3272.079
you only see over a course of days you

3270.8 --> 3273.92
appreciate it's not like you're watching

3272.079 --> 3275.6800000000003
this thing world round in the sky

3273.92 --> 3278.16
but ultimately speaking you achieve

3275.68 --> 3278.96
coriolis effect with their claim and the

3278.16 --> 3280.799
sun

3278.96 --> 3282.7200000000003
so earth's turning under the sun causes

3280.799 --> 3284.64
the sun to appear to move when it's in

3282.72 --> 3286.3999999999996
reality us turning around

3284.64 --> 3288.24
on an axis well that's coriolis

3286.4 --> 3290.7200000000003
deviation the sun

3288.24 --> 3292.0789999999997
is exhibiting according to them a 15

3290.72 --> 3294.9599999999996
degrees an hour drift

3292.079 --> 3296.1600000000003
as we turn underneath the sun that's

3294.96 --> 3297.92
what they're claiming

3296.16 --> 3299.68
well that's coriolis deflection that's

3297.92 --> 3300.559
us on a separate non-inertial spinning

3299.68 --> 3302.799
reference frame

3300.559 --> 3304.079
turning underneath stuff like balls and

3302.799 --> 3307.119
bullets

3304.079 --> 3309.119
and pendulums and gyroscopes

3307.119 --> 3310.7200000000003
yeah they're claimed to have earth

3309.119 --> 3313.2000000000003
turning underneath them to cause them to

3310.72 --> 3314.72
twist in their cages if they're gyros

3313.2 --> 3316.319
or knock dominoes over if they're

3314.72 --> 3317.5989999999997
pendulums obviously they're not going to

3316.319 --> 3318.72
whiz off they're attached to the

3317.599 --> 3320.48
building

3318.72 --> 3322.3999999999996
but the fact they claim earth turns

3320.48 --> 3324.16
underneath is what's giving you their 15

3322.4 --> 3326.2400000000002
degrees an hour drift

3324.16 --> 3327.92
that's what it is earth turning

3326.24 --> 3329.839
underneath now does earth turn

3327.92 --> 3331.44
underneath when you jump up and down

3329.839 --> 3333.04
or launch your drone and get it to hover

3331.44 --> 3334.7200000000003
or throw a ball in the air

3333.04 --> 3336.319
does your flight time get reduced when

3334.72 --> 3339.5989999999997
you travel west

3336.319 --> 3341.04
no it doesn't helicopters don't take off

3339.599 --> 3342.6400000000003
and land in a different country because

3341.04 --> 3343.839
earth turned underneath them at 15

3342.64 --> 3346.5589999999997
degrees an hour

3343.839 --> 3347.2
as is precisely their claim quick shout

3346.559 --> 3348.7200000000003
out to

3347.2 --> 3350.48
guns have never owned again this joy it

3348.72 --> 3351.9199999999996
says finally joined procrastination

3350.48 --> 3353.28
cured thank you very much for the super

3351.92 --> 3356.16
chat

3353.28 --> 3356.88
really really appreciate it yeah nathan

3356.16 --> 3358.799
i think uh

3356.88 --> 3360.2400000000002
they argue for earth turning and then

3358.799 --> 3361.7599999999998
they have to argue against their

3360.24 --> 3362.0789999999997
attorney because there's no evidence for

3361.76 --> 3364.1600000000003
it

3362.079 --> 3367.2000000000003
exactly yep we they claim it turns

3364.16 --> 3367.2
underneath it

3369.359 --> 3373.92
it's not that they argue they try to

3371.92 --> 3375.119
mitigate against it and it's

3373.92 --> 3377.839
it's then when you get into the

3375.119 --> 3379.599
ridiculousness of the mitigation that

3377.839 --> 3381.04
they do fall apart it's like you see

3379.599 --> 3383.3590000000004
where the rumpus doubles

3381.04 --> 3384.799
you take that bullet shooting into the

3383.359 --> 3388.24
air straight up

3384.799 --> 3388.72
okay so we don't observe rotation so

3388.24 --> 3390.799
what they're

3388.72 --> 3393.2
trying to pretend is that that bullet's

3390.799 --> 3394.88
flight path mathematically is it goes up

3393.2 --> 3397.4399999999996
it's losing its speed

3394.88 --> 3398.079
till it gets to the top the highest bit

3397.44 --> 3400.799
it gets where

3398.079 --> 3402.6400000000003
it's doing zero and then it falls down

3400.799 --> 3404.079
now that makes sense to us it does

3402.64 --> 3407.1189999999997
because that's what happened but

3404.079 --> 3408.88
in their world it does exactly that

3407.119 --> 3410.319
whilst also at the same time

3408.88 --> 3413.28
simultaneously

3410.319 --> 3413.92
moving a thousand miles an hour all the

3413.28 --> 3415.8390000000004
time

3413.92 --> 3417.6800000000003
to keep in lockstep with the earth

3415.839 --> 3420.4
that's rotating underneath

3417.68 --> 3421.52
so you see all this loss of momentum yet

3420.4 --> 3424.0
none

3421.52 --> 3425.7599999999998
in the in the in in the lateral to

3424.0 --> 3427.839
ensure lockstep that's

3425.76 --> 3429.119
what they have to profess ah no they

3427.839 --> 3430.96
don't stop stops up

3429.119 --> 3432.7200000000003
no they don't okay no they have to

3430.96 --> 3434.4
profess the earth turns underneath the

3432.72 --> 3436.0789999999997
bullet to give them coriolis deflection

3434.4 --> 3436.64
from the ground an optical observed

3436.079 --> 3438.4
effect

3436.64 --> 3440.0
of the bullet seeming to drift away when

3438.4 --> 3442.079
it's just going up and down

3440.0 --> 3443.28
because you're turning underneath it so

3442.079 --> 3444.7200000000003
while you're saying well they've got a

3443.28 --> 3447.52
claim it moves in lockstep

3444.72 --> 3449.1189999999997
no they don't lockstep movement of earth

3447.52 --> 3450.4
and atmosphere in violation of the first

3449.119 --> 3452.319
law of thermodynamics

3450.4 --> 3454.0
would give you no discernible difference

3452.319 --> 3455.359
between a stationary plane with a bullet

3454.0 --> 3458.4
going up and down

3455.359 --> 3460.24
and a turning rotating platform with the

3458.4 --> 3462.1600000000003
atmospheric lockstep

3460.24 --> 3463.9199999999996
moving the bullet along with the earth

3462.16 --> 3465.92
then there's no drift

3463.92 --> 3467.76
there's no 15 degrees in our deviation

3465.92 --> 3468.4
the two are supposed to deviate from

3467.76 --> 3472.0
each other

3468.4 --> 3474.559
not move together 15 degrees now drift

3472.0 --> 3475.44
not 15 degrees an hour of lock step

3474.559 --> 3478.7200000000003
movement because

3475.44 --> 3480.2400000000002
then there's no 15 degrees of anything

3478.72 --> 3482.0789999999997
yeah it's like the trampoline you know

3480.24 --> 3484.0
the infamous toe in the trampoline and

3482.079 --> 3485.76
the guy's bouncing up and down on it

3484.0 --> 3487.04
well he's doing that in a straight line

3485.76 --> 3489.5200000000004
so that basically the

3487.04 --> 3491.119
is not it's you can argue that it's not

3489.52 --> 3492.24
accelerating because it's maintaining a

3491.119 --> 3493.92
constant speed

3492.24 --> 3496.319
and it's following a straight path so

3493.92 --> 3498.079
it's like a geodesic path it's straight

3496.319 --> 3499.68
stick that same trampoline guy on the

3498.079 --> 3501.2000000000003
roundabout and then put the track to

3499.68 --> 3502.48
follow like obviously the guy's gonna

3501.2 --> 3504.16
bounce off the trampoline and

3502.48 --> 3505.76
he's gonna end up in the dirt because

3504.16 --> 3507.2799999999997
the trampoline has moved away from the

3505.76 --> 3508.7200000000003
path that it was previously on

3507.28 --> 3510.799
and that would be following a curved

3508.72 --> 3512.319
path which is what we're told we're on

3510.799 --> 3514.079
so when the trampoline is being pulled

3512.319 --> 3516.88
by the tractor in a straight line

3514.079 --> 3518.6400000000003
that's really a false um a false

3516.88 --> 3520.2400000000002
equivalence because there is no curve

3518.64 --> 3522.319
there there's no acceleration

3520.24 --> 3524.0
to demonstrate the claim that they need

3522.319 --> 3525.52
they should be putting that tractor on a

3524.0 --> 3527.68
trampoline on a roundabout

3525.52 --> 3529.359
but then demonstrating that the guy can

3527.68 --> 3530.16
can quite happily bounce up and down on

3529.359 --> 3532.88
it and stay

3530.16 --> 3532.8799999999997
in that position

3533.68 --> 3537.52
stop stop do the same thing i just did

3535.599 --> 3541.52
with adam no

3537.52 --> 3544.559
their claim is that this dude drifts

3541.52 --> 3547.92
coriolis would be us observing the guy

3544.559 --> 3550.4
looking like he bounces out

3547.92 --> 3551.92
and moves in a curved path so if this

3550.4 --> 3555.04
was a demonstration of drift

3551.92 --> 3557.119
it would be the guy drifting apart from

3555.04 --> 3559.52
the moving platform

3557.119 --> 3561.359
not staying with it this isn't a

3559.52 --> 3562.96
demonstration that is in any way

3561.359 --> 3564.72
conforming with a claim

3562.96 --> 3566.48
that we would observe things drifting

3564.72 --> 3568.48
away at 15 degrees an hour

3566.48 --> 3570.2400000000002
because we're turning underneath them

3568.48 --> 3574.079
now this is an example of something

3570.24 --> 3577.1189999999997
not moving underneath no deflection

3574.079 --> 3579.52
no 15 degrees now no drift

3577.119 --> 3580.799
so simon dan and craig who's got on this

3579.52 --> 3582.96
bandwagon

3580.799 --> 3585.28
your claim is earth turns underneath at

3582.96 --> 3586.96
15 degrees an hour to cause deflection

3585.28 --> 3589.8390000000004
from the ground as you observe things

3586.96 --> 3593.839
not attached that's coriolis effect

3589.839 --> 3596.64
this nonsense that shows no drift

3593.839 --> 3600.0789999999997
is pissing in the face of your claim we

3596.64 --> 3600.799
have 15 degrees an hour of it that's

3600.079 --> 3602.2400000000002
what i'm saying

3600.799 --> 3604.72
put this tractor going round around

3602.24 --> 3606.3999999999996
about and then see if the guy will stay

3604.72 --> 3608.16
not drifting and he's going to end up in

3606.4 --> 3608.7200000000003
the in the curve he's going to end up

3608.16 --> 3610.0789999999997
falling off

3608.72 --> 3611.68
isn't he because the thing's rotated

3610.079 --> 3612.559
underneath him whilst he's not moved and

3611.68 --> 3615.52
that would be a

3612.559 --> 3617.0400000000004
correct um example for their model but

3615.52 --> 3618.72
that's not what happens real world

3617.04 --> 3620.0
real world he bounces up and down and

3618.72 --> 3620.72
stays where in other words we're not

3620.0 --> 3623.119
moving

3620.72 --> 3625.52
yeah okay so this example is going on

3623.119 --> 3626.0
and simon dan is trying to debunk the

3625.52 --> 3628.319
drift

3626.0 --> 3629.68
because he says it your reference frames

3628.319 --> 3632.48
have been ruined

3629.68 --> 3634.319
yes yes yes well who has claims about

3632.48 --> 3638.559
reference frames

3634.319 --> 3639.2799999999997
not us yeah an example is to show a

3638.559 --> 3641.2000000000003
trampoline

3639.28 --> 3643.2000000000003
being pulled and say the guy doesn't

3641.2 --> 3644.64
curve his way out of it while you watch

3643.2 --> 3646.64
him on the trampoline

3644.64 --> 3647.68
so from your vantage point on the

3646.64 --> 3650.16
trampoline

3647.68 --> 3652.319
platform that's moving with the tractor

3650.16 --> 3653.2799999999997
it would look like the guy curves out

3652.319 --> 3655.04
the back of it

3653.28 --> 3657.0400000000004
as he's towed along that would be him

3655.04 --> 3658.48
drifting apart from the reference frame

3657.04 --> 3660.799
you're still attached to

3658.48 --> 3661.76
so you'd have to be on the tractor sat

3660.799 --> 3664.0
on its roof

3661.76 --> 3665.76
watching him bounce out of the

3664.0 --> 3668.0
trampoline's reference frame

3665.76 --> 3669.8390000000004
looking like he's curving away from you

3668.0 --> 3671.44
in reality he's just gone up and down

3669.839 --> 3674.16
and the tractors moved away

3671.44 --> 3675.359
underneath him that would be analogous

3674.16 --> 3678.16
to the drift

3675.359 --> 3680.16
that we don't see on earth you don't

3678.16 --> 3682.3999999999996
jump up and down and the guy who still

3680.16 --> 3684.3999999999996
stood on the ground what you seem to

3682.4 --> 3685.92
curve away from him because he's

3684.4 --> 3687.92
rotating underneath

3685.92 --> 3689.599
that's what they need to show but what

3687.92 --> 3690.48
they're showing is an example without

3689.599 --> 3692.0
drift

3690.48 --> 3693.76
it's like uh hello you're supposed to

3692.0 --> 3695.44
have 15 degrees an hour of it

3693.76 --> 3697.5200000000004
all these examples that show single

3695.44 --> 3699.599
reference frames are showing us that

3697.52 --> 3701.68
what the guy jumps up and down whilst

3699.599 --> 3703.2000000000003
towed and it's absolutely no different

3701.68 --> 3704.3999999999996
to him jumping up and down when he's not

3703.2 --> 3706.16
towed

3704.4 --> 3707.599
so you wouldn't be able to discern any

3706.16 --> 3709.44
difference whatsoever between

3707.599 --> 3710.7200000000003
an earth that's moving with ma with its

3709.44 --> 3713.04
atmosphere moving with it

3710.72 --> 3714.5589999999997
and a guy just jumping up and down

3713.04 --> 3717.68
there's no difference then

3714.559 --> 3720.4
so it proves precisely nothing and

3717.68 --> 3721.68
you're supposed to claim 15 degrees an

3720.4 --> 3723.92
hour deviation

3721.68 --> 3725.44
that'll be earth turning under stuff not

3723.92 --> 3727.119
attached

3725.44 --> 3728.799
yeah not an example that's got

3727.119 --> 3730.6400000000003
absolutely no difference between a guy

3728.799 --> 3732.799
just bouncing without moving at all

3730.64 --> 3734.8799999999997
and a guy bouncing but not deviating at

3732.799 --> 3735.7599999999998
15 degrees an hour as they keep getting

3734.88 --> 3738.1600000000003
behind

3735.76 --> 3739.5200000000004
they're thick craig is the most recent

3738.16 --> 3744.0
to stick his stamp on this

3739.52 --> 3744.0
thick as you can get

3746.88 --> 3751.44
what you said trampoline video hold on

3749.599 --> 3753.3590000000004
chris oh sorry chris

3751.44 --> 3754.48
for me the stupidest thing about the

3753.359 --> 3757.68
trampoline video

3754.48 --> 3760.799
is that it actually looks like somebody

3757.68 --> 3764.16
actually made it with cgi to prove

3760.799 --> 3765.68
the conservation of momentum and

3764.16 --> 3767.44
it looks like that's what happened it

3765.68 --> 3769.7599999999998
doesn't look like it's a proper video

3767.44 --> 3770.48
and it looks like it was made by a

3769.76 --> 3773.599
bowler

3770.48 --> 3775.28
to show the conservation of momentum you

3773.599 --> 3775.92
know which completely debunks their

3775.28 --> 3779.2000000000003
claim

3775.92 --> 3780.319
of adrift it looks like that to me it

3779.2 --> 3783.839
looks like it's cgi

3780.319 --> 3783.839
not that it matters

3789.119 --> 3793.599
go ahead chris it's not it's not fake

3791.68 --> 3795.68
yeah so let's be clear right let's not

3793.599 --> 3796.96
say things that are that are sort of

3795.68 --> 3800.64
basic and unders

3796.96 --> 3802.2400000000002
understood so it is real and if you

3800.64 --> 3804.0
if you move at a constant rate like

3802.24 --> 3805.5989999999997
someone said earlier in a straight line

3804.0 --> 3807.52
and you throw something up it will come

3805.599 --> 3807.92
back down where it where it took off

3807.52 --> 3810.72
that's

3807.92 --> 3811.119
that's fine where it doesn't make sense

3810.72 --> 3812.24
is

3811.119 --> 3814.319
a is two things when there's

3812.24 --> 3816.319
acceleration and when there's

3814.319 --> 3818.24
angular momentum so if there's angular

3816.319 --> 3819.92
momentum say on a roundabout the whole

3818.24 --> 3821.2799999999997
reason that people use roundabouts in

3819.92 --> 3823.039
these youtube videos

3821.28 --> 3825.119
is because of the angular momentum and

3823.039 --> 3826.7990000000004
that that ball is not going to maintain

3825.119 --> 3827.6800000000003
the angular momentum it will maintain

3826.799 --> 3830.16
the momentum

3827.68 --> 3831.359
where it left in a straight line but you

3830.16 --> 3833.7599999999998
spin around the ball

3831.359 --> 3835.119
in a different momentum than the ball

3833.76 --> 3838.559
which was just in your hand

3835.119 --> 3838.88
so the epiphany i had was when they say

3838.559 --> 3841.599
that

3838.88 --> 3843.2000000000003
coriolis is maintaining um conservation

3841.599 --> 3845.52
of momentum

3843.2 --> 3847.2799999999997
the whole it's the exact opposite it's

3845.52 --> 3849.44
not maintaining the angular moment

3847.28 --> 3851.2000000000003
momentum that it had if it did maintain

3849.44 --> 3852.64
angular momentum you couldn't use the

3851.2 --> 3854.0789999999997
roundabout as an example because you

3852.64 --> 3855.68
there would be no coriolis effect

3854.079 --> 3858.88
exactly

3855.68 --> 3860.5589999999997
exactly that's why you did if the

3858.88 --> 3861.92
tractor was towing that trampoline

3860.559 --> 3864.079
around a roundabout and then

3861.92 --> 3865.52
conservation of momentum worked you

3864.079 --> 3867.28
would be able to bounce that guy up and

3865.52 --> 3868.48
down up and down whilst going around on

3867.28 --> 3870.2400000000002
a curved trajectory

3868.48 --> 3871.68
and he would maintain uh going around

3870.24 --> 3873.0389999999998
the curve with the trampoline

3871.68 --> 3874.0
and obviously we know that that's not

3873.039 --> 3875.44
going to happen he's going to end up in

3874.0 --> 3876.799
the dirt he's going to fall off it isn't

3875.44 --> 3877.76
he because it's curving underneath him

3876.799 --> 3879.599
whilst he does it

3877.76 --> 3880.96
so really the only way they could prove

3879.599 --> 3881.76
their point would be to get it on a

3880.96 --> 3884.7200000000003
roundabout

3881.76 --> 3885.5200000000004
show the guy conserving angular momentum

3884.72 --> 3888.16
no

3885.52 --> 3889.7599999999998
that's not their point so you're saying

3888.16 --> 3891.68
to show their point

3889.76 --> 3893.76
that we don't have 15 degrees an hour

3891.68 --> 3896.64
drift they'd need a guy bouncing

3893.76 --> 3899.119
on a roundabout and not drifting well

3896.64 --> 3900.8799999999997
that wouldn't prove earth spins

3899.119 --> 3902.4
so no they don't need to show that you

3900.88 --> 3903.44
looked at me before i got to my

3902.4 --> 3904.96
crescendo

3903.44 --> 3906.7200000000003
they would need to have the guy being

3904.96 --> 3907.2
told around the round about bouncing up

3906.72 --> 3909.4399999999996
and down

3907.2 --> 3910.24
and not ending up in the dirt no we all

3909.44 --> 3913.359
know that he wouldn't

3910.24 --> 3915.359
no you're just not listening to me no

3913.359 --> 3916.64
for if they show a guy on a roundabout

3915.359 --> 3917.92
jumping up and down on a trampoline

3916.64 --> 3919.359
that's in one of the sections

3917.92 --> 3920.7200000000003
so one section on the roundabout's got

3919.359 --> 3922.0789999999997
trampoline the other eight sections

3920.72 --> 3924.799
haven't for the sake of argument

3922.079 --> 3926.6400000000003
he bounces up and down and moves along

3924.799 --> 3927.68
with the rotating platform moving

3926.64 --> 3931.2799999999997
rotating with him

3927.68 --> 3933.359
underneath well then he's not drifting

3931.28 --> 3935.119
that's not what they need to demonstrate

3933.359 --> 3936.319
they need to show the guy bounce up and

3935.119 --> 3938.0
down on the roundabout

3936.319 --> 3939.839
and then from another person on the

3938.0 --> 3940.559
roundabout's perspective he'll end up in

3939.839 --> 3941.92
the dirt

3940.559 --> 3943.2000000000003
and from the person who's still on the

3941.92 --> 3945.119
roundabouts perspective he looked like

3943.2 --> 3947.0389999999998
he curved away from them

3945.119 --> 3948.4
even though he just went up and down

3947.039 --> 3949.28
because that's what they claim earth

3948.4 --> 3952.4
does

3949.28 --> 3953.92
it just doesn't do that

3952.4 --> 3956.1600000000003
okay i stand corrected you are correct

3953.92 --> 3958.319
you're better yours was better than mine

3956.16 --> 3959.52
i i still won't lie that i should go

3958.319 --> 3962.319
down straight

3959.52 --> 3965.44
if i'm going straight in a flatbed truck

3962.319 --> 3967.44
and i'm doing let's say 30 miles an hour

3965.44 --> 3969.28
and i'm laying on my back and i throw a

3967.44 --> 3970.88
baseball straight up in the air it's not

3969.28 --> 3972.1600000000003
coming back down to me

3970.88 --> 3974.88
yeah and that's what they claim earth

3972.16 --> 3977.2
does that's precisely what coriolis is

3974.88 --> 3979.28
you seeing the ball from the flatbed

3977.2 --> 3980.319
look like it curves away from you into

3979.28 --> 3982.3190000000004
the distance

3980.319 --> 3984.5589999999997
in reality you've just thrown it up it's

3982.319 --> 3987.119
gone up and then dropped down

3984.559 --> 3988.88
but from your vantage point it's curved

3987.119 --> 3991.359
away from you into the distance

3988.88 --> 3993.2000000000003
as you drove away from it they claim

3991.359 --> 3996.24
that's what happens on earth

3993.2 --> 3998.72
a ball gets kicked on a football field

3996.24 --> 4000.319
and makes the field goal because earth

3998.72 --> 4001.4399999999996
turned underneath it to cause an

4000.319 --> 4003.68
apparent deflection

4001.44 --> 4005.44
that's what they claim so you need to

4003.68 --> 4006.3999999999996
see the things actually drifting away

4005.44 --> 4009.44
from you

4006.4 --> 4010.88
not justify why they move together and

4009.44 --> 4014.4
that's precisely what they're doing the

4010.88 --> 4016.88
idiots don't understand coriolis

4014.4 --> 4018.0
chris how could you prove outside of

4016.88 --> 4020.0
that video

4018.0 --> 4021.359
where of the trampoline feather jumping

4020.0 --> 4022.319
up and down on the trampoline with the

4021.359 --> 4024.319
tractor pulling it

4022.319 --> 4025.92
how could you prove it say to that what

4024.319 --> 4029.2799999999997
other proof have you got that

4025.92 --> 4030.88
if you're on a moving uh vehicle and you

4029.28 --> 4031.44
throw something up the air or jump up

4030.88 --> 4032.319
there

4031.44 --> 4033.92
that's not going to go out from

4032.319 --> 4035.2
underneath it or you're not going to go

4033.92 --> 4036.0
from underneath the ball you drop in

4035.2 --> 4038.8799999999997
here

4036.0 --> 4039.839
i just don't see that happening even if

4038.88 --> 4042.96
they didn't

4039.839 --> 4044.88
they said yes we've pointed out

4042.96 --> 4046.319
this with brian sleeping warrior and

4044.88 --> 4048.6400000000003
adam all on the same show

4046.319 --> 4050.319
so let's say they achieved that brian

4048.64 --> 4052.16
they managed to show

4050.319 --> 4053.52
on a moving train they're doing it's on

4052.16 --> 4056.8799999999997
screen with this trampoline

4053.52 --> 4057.839
look he's not drifting reference frame's

4056.88 --> 4059.6800000000003
ruined

4057.839 --> 4061.68
he's not moving away from the moving

4059.68 --> 4062.24
reference frame underneath at 15 degrees

4061.68 --> 4066.0
an hour

4062.24 --> 4068.0789999999997
what a win for flat earth

4066.0 --> 4069.599
oh you know i can't demonstrate a lack

4068.079 --> 4072.4
of drift speaking about

4069.599 --> 4073.839
the claim that it is a real thing i

4072.4 --> 4075.359
haven't seen enough evidence that there

4073.839 --> 4079.599
is real that that would happen

4075.359 --> 4081.5989999999997
linearly yeah but it wouldn't be drift

4079.599 --> 4083.119
oh yeah i'm not talking about their

4081.599 --> 4083.52
claim i'm just talking about what chris

4083.119 --> 4085.52
said

4083.52 --> 4087.44
concerning that i am i'm in the same

4085.52 --> 4089.44
camp as neil i don't believe that

4087.44 --> 4091.52
if you're moving uh sitting on the top

4089.44 --> 4092.559
of a cow that's moving and i draw a ball

4091.52 --> 4093.839
up in the air it's gonna come straight

4092.559 --> 4095.599
back down to where it was

4093.839 --> 4097.5199999999995
it wouldn't and i'm saying that that's

4095.599 --> 4099.279
the effect they need earth to have

4097.52 --> 4100.88
they need you to throw a ball up in the

4099.279 --> 4102.2390000000005
air on earth

4100.88 --> 4103.6
and have it whizz away from you a

4102.239 --> 4105.12
thousand miles an hour on the equator

4103.6 --> 4106.319
like it would on your flatbed

4105.12 --> 4108.159
you throw the ball in the air and

4106.319 --> 4110.080000000001
because you move away from it

4108.159 --> 4112.08
it looks like it flies away from you in

4110.08 --> 4113.679
a curved path well that's what a ball

4112.08 --> 4116.159
should do on earth

4113.679 --> 4117.6
you launch a ball into the air and what

4116.159 --> 4119.04
do you know whatever rate you're

4117.6 --> 4120.96
supposed to be turning underneath it it

4119.04 --> 4122.96
whizzes away from you at that speed

4120.96 --> 4125.679
that's what's supposed to happen on a

4122.96 --> 4126.2390000000005
turning earth 15 degrees an hour of

4125.679 --> 4128.88
drift

4126.239 --> 4130.48
that's things drifting away from you and

4128.88 --> 4132.400000000001
it never happens

4130.48 --> 4134.159
so we get into the argument about well

4132.4 --> 4134.799
if they could just show a guy on a

4134.159 --> 4137.2789999999995
roundabout

4134.799 --> 4138.4
not drifting they'd prove their point

4137.279 --> 4140.799000000001
that we don't have

4138.4 --> 4142.08
15 degrees an hour as they claim proves

4140.799 --> 4143.44
earth spins

4142.08 --> 4146.08
do you see where i'm going every time

4143.44 --> 4147.3589999999995
they try and prove people don't drift on

4146.08 --> 4149.679
trampolines

4147.359 --> 4150.4800000000005
well you're claiming earth does have 15

4149.679 --> 4152.64
degrees of it

4150.48 --> 4154.3189999999995
so what are you proving that there isn't

4152.64 --> 4156.159000000001
a proof of earth spin

4154.319 --> 4157.52
shout out to godzilla he's been sat with

4156.159 --> 4159.679
his super trapper ages

4157.52 --> 4162.080000000001
sure the earth spins as sure as biden

4159.679 --> 4164.4800000000005
won the election legitimately

4162.08 --> 4164.48
okay

4167.359 --> 4175.120000000001
so come on man nathan i can't

4170.48 --> 4175.12
find you finished adam

4176.64 --> 4180.319
again i think my point may be missed a

4179.6 --> 4181.92
little bit

4180.319 --> 4183.279
the point i was making is they'll do

4181.92 --> 4184.4
that then they'll go into the

4183.279 --> 4188.159000000001
bullshittery of

4184.4 --> 4188.799
of what has to be happening and so that

4188.159 --> 4192.239
you don't

4188.799 --> 4193.2789999999995
actually see coriolis and that to me is

4192.239 --> 4195.678999999999
the point where

4193.279 --> 4198.2390000000005
you just undermine them that there is

4195.679 --> 4200.4
none as soon as they go into that

4198.239 --> 4201.44
the point of going into the complex uh

4200.4 --> 4204.0
non

4201.44 --> 4204.879999999999
uh what rumpus phrase was or whatever

4204.0 --> 4206.64
he's

4204.88 --> 4209.12
as soon as they go into that they're

4206.64 --> 4212.2390000000005
building a a world where there is

4209.12 --> 4215.36
no observable coriolis and therefore

4212.239 --> 4217.5199999999995
it disproves the point straight away for

4215.36 --> 4219.759999999999
me as soon as they go into that

4217.52 --> 4221.84
they're trying to say that in reality we

4219.76 --> 4224.96
have no coriolis because look this

4221.84 --> 4228.0
occurs so there is none yeah exactly

4224.96 --> 4230.4
yeah look at this man not drifting so

4228.0 --> 4232.159
here's my example that shows we don't

4230.4 --> 4234.719
have drift reference frames ruined

4232.159 --> 4235.92
it's like okay great so you're showing

4234.719 --> 4237.44
us that we don't have two reference

4235.92 --> 4239.92
frames on earth turning underneath then

4237.44 --> 4241.199
oh that's so sloppy no that's what's

4239.92 --> 4243.4400000000005
supposed to happen and doesn't

4241.199 --> 4246.4
on a turning earth that isn't turning

4243.44 --> 4246.4
earth is stationary

4246.48 --> 4250.879999999999
also adam i just heard that the other uh

4249.12 --> 4253.36
just yesterday i listened to that

4250.88 --> 4254.400000000001
uh when lumpus said it was sloppy and

4253.36 --> 4256.88
i'm thinking

4254.4 --> 4259.36
so it's sloppy to describe the earth

4256.88 --> 4261.679
spinning underneath that pendulum

4259.36 --> 4262.5599999999995
when that's the claim so your claim is

4261.679 --> 4264.159
sloppy

4262.56 --> 4265.679
yeah sloppy until he goes on to ranty

4264.159 --> 4267.36
flat earth's channel and then claims the

4265.679 --> 4269.04
earth is turning underneath the sun

4267.36 --> 4270.639999999999
thousand miles that way and as soon as

4269.04 --> 4271.36
you're doing that you're arguing in

4270.64 --> 4273.04
there

4271.36 --> 4274.4
[ __ ] excuse for why you don't see

4273.04 --> 4275.04
earth turn where you know the earth's

4274.4 --> 4276.639999999999
turning

4275.04 --> 4278.08
exactly and you just gotta bring them

4276.64 --> 4280.320000000001
back to the fact that

4278.08 --> 4281.679
no then you demonstrate there are no

4280.32 --> 4284.799999999999
reference frames end off

4281.679 --> 4287.28
you can't well that's what then did

4284.8 --> 4290.0
so thanks dan for demonstrating lack of

4287.28 --> 4290.0
reference frames

4292.159 --> 4295.199
so what does that mean relative to the

4294.0 --> 4296.64
earth drift

4295.199 --> 4298.0
it means earth's turning underneath

4296.64 --> 4299.4400000000005
relative to the spinning reference

4298.0 --> 4301.44
that's turning underneath

4299.44 --> 4303.599999999999
they just use this vernacular to confuse

4301.44 --> 4305.04
people neil

4303.6 --> 4307.1990000000005
you just don't want to say spinning

4305.04 --> 4308.48
underneath yeah relative motion well

4307.199 --> 4310.08
relative to what

4308.48 --> 4312.159
well to the earth turning underneath in

4310.08 --> 4312.8
their claim but they won't ever voice

4312.159 --> 4314.4
that

4312.8 --> 4316.320000000001
because it's overtly obvious that

4314.4 --> 4317.759999999999
doesn't happen earth isn't turning

4316.32 --> 4318.96
underneath anything

4317.76 --> 4321.360000000001
now the fact that they can assert it

4318.96 --> 4324.2390000000005
with a football a sniper's bullet

4321.36 --> 4325.199
a gyroscope a pendulum absolutely

4324.239 --> 4327.599999999999
cements

4325.199 --> 4328.719
their claim the earth turns underneath

4327.6 --> 4331.280000000001
stuff not attached

4328.719 --> 4332.719
at 15 degrees an hour until we point it

4331.28 --> 4333.199
out and say that would shorten flight

4332.719 --> 4335.199
time

4333.199 --> 4336.5599999999995
or your drone was away a thousand miles

4335.199 --> 4337.678999999999
an hour and then they tell us it's a

4336.56 --> 4340.400000000001
sloppy description

4337.679 --> 4342.0
because it doesn't happen well some

4340.4 --> 4345.04
people do sacrilege and say

4342.0 --> 4348.239
that um neil degrasse tyson got it wrong

4345.04 --> 4350.08
some people do actually say that

4348.239 --> 4351.839999999999
they did get it wrong we say that neil

4350.08 --> 4353.92
okay

4351.84 --> 4356.0
can we try it now can we see if any

4353.92 --> 4357.84
glober will tell us if the earth is

4356.0 --> 4359.679
supposed to be spinning underneath

4357.84 --> 4361.679
pendulums and hot air balloons and

4359.679 --> 4363.76
bullets and all that stuff

4361.679 --> 4364.88
i think well if you look at that knight

4363.76 --> 4367.360000000001
right

4364.88 --> 4368.0
last night showed nathan put on i don't

4367.36 --> 4370.239
think

4368.0 --> 4373.04
the rumpus didn't know how a pendulum

4370.239 --> 4374.959999999999
works i think he realized

4373.04 --> 4376.48
[ __ ] i don't i can't i know where

4374.96 --> 4378.4
nathan's going to take me

4376.48 --> 4380.08
so i can't answer it this way i can't

4378.4 --> 4382.799999999999
answer it he was he knew

4380.08 --> 4384.8
he was done all ends up so it was better

4382.8 --> 4385.52
to pretend you don't know how a pendulum

4384.8 --> 4387.6
works

4385.52 --> 4389.120000000001
than to be led down that path and get

4387.6 --> 4392.4800000000005
your ass banked or

4389.12 --> 4395.84
a firm teabagging as i think he received

4392.48 --> 4397.44
yeah we've got them too exactly at the

4395.84 --> 4398.0
expense of his own humility he'd rather

4397.44 --> 4399.839999999999
say well i don't

4398.0 --> 4401.6
really know maybe it's an elliptical

4399.84 --> 4402.88
orbit well if a pendulum has an

4401.6 --> 4405.1990000000005
elliptical orbit

4402.88 --> 4406.32
like with their example dragging a man

4405.199 --> 4408.639999999999
not drifting

4406.32 --> 4409.759999999999
then sorry pendulums just have a

4408.64 --> 4411.4400000000005
circular motion then

4409.76 --> 4412.88
so nothing to see here they just

4411.44 --> 4414.159
naturally go around in a circle it's not

4412.88 --> 4415.4400000000005
proving anything then that's just what

4414.159 --> 4418.0
pendulums do

4415.44 --> 4419.5199999999995
no it's claimed earth turning underneath

4418.0 --> 4421.36
he wouldn't do that as soon as that came

4419.52 --> 4422.88
out his mouth later he realized that the

4421.36 --> 4424.239
consequence of that

4422.88 --> 4425.52
being that although the earth's not

4424.239 --> 4426.4
spinning then it's just a wobbly

4425.52 --> 4429.280000000001
pendulum

4426.4 --> 4430.639999999999
yeah he didn't know which way to go

4429.28 --> 4432.96
because they can't because

4430.64 --> 4434.0
their whole premise contradicts itself

4432.96 --> 4436.08
and he knows it

4434.0 --> 4437.28
then he started stuttering yeah and he

4436.08 --> 4438.8
knows it that's the thing that was the

4437.28 --> 4440.8
most telling for me

4438.8 --> 4441.92
that he knew he had to figure out a way

4440.8 --> 4445.4400000000005
around the problem

4441.92 --> 4445.4400000000005
so he's aware of the problem

4445.6 --> 4449.04
but let's not forget let's not forget

4447.76 --> 4451.1990000000005
the biggest uh

4449.04 --> 4452.88
tell here the minute they argue

4451.199 --> 4455.12
conservation and momentum

4452.88 --> 4457.76
they're basically saying okay we admit

4455.12 --> 4459.199
the sun is moving at 15 degrees

4457.76 --> 4460.719
yeah it's not us turning underneath

4459.199 --> 4462.239
there's no deflection there's no drift

4460.719 --> 4463.199
there's no coriolis effect earth isn't

4462.239 --> 4467.28
turning underneath

4463.199 --> 4467.28
for you to say it would be sloppy

4467.92 --> 4472.08
and they're also trying to take you off

4469.52 --> 4472.64
the the actual subject of the coriolis

4472.08 --> 4474.96
because

4472.64 --> 4476.96
the conservation of momentum is has

4474.96 --> 4479.12
nothing to do with the coriolis

4476.96 --> 4481.36
coriolis is the observation from the

4479.12 --> 4483.199
non-inertial reference frame

4481.36 --> 4484.5599999999995
conservation momentum that would be the

4483.199 --> 4486.879999999999
projectile ball

4484.56 --> 4487.84
balloon whatever the hell they're just

4486.88 --> 4490.88
trying to

4487.84 --> 4492.96
distract you from the actual topic

4490.88 --> 4494.08
so you need reference frames we need to

4492.96 --> 4495.52
observe it from the ground

4494.08 --> 4496.88
you need to observe it from the turning

4495.52 --> 4498.400000000001
reference frame if you're describing it

4496.88 --> 4500.8
with a roundabout it's your observation

4498.4 --> 4503.12
of the tree oh no it's coming towards me

4500.8 --> 4504.88
that's the description of coriolis so

4503.12 --> 4506.64
the path of the tree

4504.88 --> 4508.4800000000005
and the tree's conservation of its

4506.64 --> 4510.719
angular or linear momentum

4508.48 --> 4512.4
uh that's kind of relevant to the fact

4510.719 --> 4514.2390000000005
that you're turning towards it

4512.4 --> 4516.4
to make it look like the trees coming

4514.239 --> 4518.5599999999995
towards you or if it was a

4516.4 --> 4521.04
ball being thrown it would be the effect

4518.56 --> 4522.719
of you moving towards the ball to make

4521.04 --> 4524.96
its curved path appear

4522.719 --> 4527.199
from your vantage point well that's

4524.96 --> 4529.36
nothing to do with the actual path

4527.199 --> 4531.04
because it's a not actual deflection

4529.36 --> 4533.92
caused by

4531.04 --> 4534.64
you turning underneath and as chocolate

4533.92 --> 4536.32
says

4534.64 --> 4538.08
once you point out that we're not

4536.32 --> 4539.92
turning underneath anything nothing's

4538.08 --> 4541.36
drifting at 15 degrees an hour

4539.92 --> 4543.6
they want to take it into the frame of

4541.36 --> 4545.839999999999
reference of the ball or the bullet

4543.6 --> 4546.64
or the helicopter and tell you all about

4545.84 --> 4548.4800000000005
how that

4546.64 --> 4550.64
is conserving momentum when the

4548.48 --> 4552.08
observation of coriolis is you observing

4550.64 --> 4553.84
it seem to drift as you turn

4552.08 --> 4555.5199999999995
underneath it but because we don't see

4553.84 --> 4558.4800000000005
it they need to talk about the bullet

4555.52 --> 4559.679
and its actual path when coriolis is not

4558.48 --> 4562.32
actual deflection

4559.679 --> 4563.4400000000005
that you see from the ground as you turn

4562.32 --> 4565.36
underneath something

4563.44 --> 4567.678999999999
so you can't justify them turning

4565.36 --> 4569.12
together and still have coriolis effect

4567.679 --> 4571.679
because you're not turning underneath it

4569.12 --> 4572.8
anymore as you require on a globe earth

4571.679 --> 4575.679
that's spinning because that's your

4572.8 --> 4577.52
claim proof it spins

4575.679 --> 4578.88
that's why i like the white most because

4577.52 --> 4580.56
they can't claim

4578.88 --> 4583.52
conservation momentum because the land

4580.56 --> 4583.52
post ain't moving

4583.84 --> 4589.4400000000005
i i'd like to just give some clarity on

4586.8 --> 4592.88
what the actual conservation of momentum

4589.44 --> 4593.759999999999
is the conservation for both angular and

4592.88 --> 4595.6
linear

4593.76 --> 4597.1990000000005
if you are on the children's roundabout

4595.6 --> 4598.64
and you're holding on to the barrels of

4597.199 --> 4599.5199999999995
that roundabout when it's been spun

4598.64 --> 4601.6
around

4599.52 --> 4603.1990000000005
when you leave gold at but when you're

4601.6 --> 4605.6
out at the edge of it you leave go

4603.199 --> 4606.48
you will be trolled away at an angle

4605.6 --> 4608.8
from that

4606.48 --> 4610.48
spinning reference frame but you're

4608.8 --> 4613.679
conserving the momentum

4610.48 --> 4615.28
of the movement of the uh

4613.679 --> 4616.96
of the roundabout you'll be thrown away

4615.28 --> 4618.5599999999995
at an angle away from that

4616.96 --> 4620.159
we all know this when we did this when

4618.56 --> 4621.92
we were younger in playgrounds

4620.159 --> 4623.28
when we held on to the barrels on the

4621.92 --> 4625.6
roundabout thing

4623.28 --> 4627.5199999999995
uh uh and some of their spawners and

4625.6 --> 4627.92
then they let go and you got thrown away

4627.52 --> 4629.76
at an

4627.92 --> 4631.36
angle away from it yeah and then your

4629.76 --> 4632.96
momentum is like in

4631.36 --> 4635.04
in when you start when you see in a

4632.96 --> 4636.719
movie where someone's on top of a car

4635.04 --> 4638.4
and the car is driving fast and then it

4636.719 --> 4639.36
puts on the brakes and the person on the

4638.4 --> 4642.239
top of the car

4639.36 --> 4643.759999999999
flies off the car and goes forward

4642.239 --> 4646.0
that's linear momentum

4643.76 --> 4648.159000000001
that's the conservation of momentum not

4646.0 --> 4650.159
what the borders have been saying it is

4648.159 --> 4651.839999999999
that's the real conservation of momentum

4650.159 --> 4654.799999999999
both for angular and linear

4651.84 --> 4655.52
you're concerned conserving the momentum

4654.8 --> 4658.08
of

4655.52 --> 4660.0
what you were of the of what you were on

4658.08 --> 4662.32
or what of the direction you were moving

4660.0 --> 4664.56
but it's only for a fraction of a second

4662.32 --> 4667.36
for a very short period of time

4664.56 --> 4669.1990000000005
it's also not drift but yeah if you want

4667.36 --> 4671.44
to say that as you are thrown for the

4669.199 --> 4672.799999999999
fraction of a second that you leave

4671.44 --> 4674.239
your goodness could retain some of the

4672.8 --> 4674.96
angular momentum of the roundabout yeah

4674.239 --> 4676.5599999999995
i'll agree with you

4674.96 --> 4678.0
but does that mean that the guy who's

4676.56 --> 4680.96
watching you after you've

4678.0 --> 4681.44
left will still see you flying around

4680.96 --> 4684.8
off

4681.44 --> 4686.879999999999
the roundabout next to you no

4684.8 --> 4688.64
no don't forget that moving frame would

4686.88 --> 4692.2390000000005
have to stop for you to be able to

4688.64 --> 4695.1990000000005
conserve the energy

4692.239 --> 4697.919999999999
uh no not necessarily or you no or you

4695.199 --> 4697.919999999999
would have to leave

4698.239 --> 4701.839999999999
yeah you don't believe let me clarify

4701.92 --> 4705.52
um some claims because again i just want

4704.32 --> 4707.92
to make sure everyone's

4705.52 --> 4708.88
accurate so there's still a question as

4707.92 --> 4710.56
to if

4708.88 --> 4711.76
you know if you did this on the platform

4710.56 --> 4713.1990000000005
and it's moving straight line you throw

4711.76 --> 4715.1990000000005
the ball up it comes down

4713.199 --> 4716.239
it does and there's a and the reason i

4715.199 --> 4719.28
knew that's because i had seen

4716.239 --> 4721.199
i had seen examples i posted one live

4719.28 --> 4722.5599999999995
chat i know some of you all are on this

4721.199 --> 4725.199
on the hangout

4722.56 --> 4727.04
but if you go if you youtube cinematics

4725.199 --> 4728.879999999999
demo carton ball

4727.04 --> 4730.32
i will show you that there's a plat

4728.88 --> 4732.32
there's a straight platform

4730.32 --> 4733.5199999999995
there's a device on it and it and it as

4732.32 --> 4735.12
he pushes the pla

4733.52 --> 4737.4400000000005
the device in a straight line on the

4735.12 --> 4739.12
platform at a few miles per hour it

4737.44 --> 4740.48
shoots a ball up about three feet

4739.12 --> 4742.8
and the ball comes back down and lands

4740.48 --> 4746.0
in the in the same way

4742.8 --> 4747.28
of course yeah

4746.0 --> 4749.44
higher ones i've seen them like eight

4747.28 --> 4751.12
nine feet it's it's still work

4749.44 --> 4752.48
still works but the nation's point it

4751.12 --> 4755.5199999999995
debunks their claim anyway

4752.48 --> 4757.12
exactly it's lack of drift back of 15

4755.52 --> 4757.84
degrees now deviation as we turn

4757.12 --> 4759.36
underneath

4757.84 --> 4761.28
it's just going up and coming down again

4759.36 --> 4762.88
in the same spot and if they say oh well

4761.28 --> 4764.88
earth traveled with the atmosphere

4762.88 --> 4766.88
well then that's still not drifting so

4764.88 --> 4767.6
it's not got a deflection at 15 degrees

4766.88 --> 4769.6
an hour

4767.6 --> 4770.8
well that's the thing that's needed to

4769.6 --> 4774.84
prove we're spinning

4770.8 --> 4777.04
if it drifts at the same speed it's not

4774.84 --> 4778.719
drifting

4777.04 --> 4780.239
i agree with that i'm just saying on

4778.719 --> 4782.56
that straight ahead

4780.239 --> 4784.08
sidewalk moving yeah if i'm flipping the

4782.56 --> 4786.400000000001
ball up three or four feet

4784.08 --> 4788.4
it's gonna come right back down once i

4786.4 --> 4789.12
launched that freaking thing 20 30 feet

4788.4 --> 4792.08
in the air

4789.12 --> 4795.12
it is not coming back down into my hand

4792.08 --> 4797.679
not first turning underneath it it's not

4795.12 --> 4798.48
right if you maintain if the if the

4797.679 --> 4800.4
momentum

4798.48 --> 4802.32
is the same there's no acceleration or

4800.4 --> 4803.5199999999995
deceleration it absolutely will and i

4802.32 --> 4806.0
just want to make sure your

4803.52 --> 4807.1990000000005
your understanding of that for example

4806.0 --> 4808.719
if you're in a car

4807.199 --> 4810.239
you have a ball in your and you're in a

4808.719 --> 4811.92
passenger seat and the person's going

4810.239 --> 4813.44
exactly 50 miles per hour

4811.92 --> 4814.96
if you throw the ball up in a perfectly

4813.44 --> 4816.32
straight line which would probably be

4814.96 --> 4817.84
impossible but if you could

4816.32 --> 4819.92
it would come right back down into your

4817.84 --> 4823.4400000000005
hand right no matter how how how

4819.92 --> 4825.92
you doing if you're inside

4823.44 --> 4827.12
inside the car yeah with the with the

4825.92 --> 4830.96
air moving along with you

4827.12 --> 4834.08
yes of course nobody's arguing

4830.96 --> 4835.28
no no no they are neil no dan and craig

4834.08 --> 4836.719
fight the fly earth are currently

4835.28 --> 4838.8
arguing that they're saying

4836.719 --> 4840.2390000000005
look this guy is analogous to you

4838.8 --> 4842.639
throwing a ball up and down in a car

4840.239 --> 4845.5199999999995
that's closed moving at 50 miles an hour

4842.639 --> 4846.639
there's no deflection there is no 15

4845.52 --> 4848.4800000000005
degrees an hour drift

4846.639 --> 4851.52
the ball doesn't fly to the back of the

4848.48 --> 4853.199
car uh yeah but you need earth to do

4851.52 --> 4854.96
that you need earth to demonstrate that

4853.199 --> 4857.12
it turns underneath stuff not attached

4854.96 --> 4858.88
at 15 degrees an hour that's drift

4857.12 --> 4860.159
so none of this i'll show you how it

4858.88 --> 4863.36
doesn't drift

4860.159 --> 4865.759999999999
oh well that doesn't prove it does

4863.36 --> 4867.92
nathan it's a false analogy anyway if

4865.76 --> 4869.52
their claim is that that's analogous to

4867.92 --> 4871.12
like chucking a ball up and down in the

4869.52 --> 4871.84
back of a car traveling at 50 miles an

4871.12 --> 4873.76
hour

4871.84 --> 4875.84
that car has got to be on a curve at 50

4873.76 --> 4877.4400000000005
mile an hour for it to be an equivalence

4875.84 --> 4879.12
but if they've got it in a straight line

4877.44 --> 4880.239
that's not an equivalence that's a false

4879.12 --> 4881.44
equivalence

4880.239 --> 4882.959999999999
but it's a false equivalence for

4881.44 --> 4884.0
something they're not claiming because

4882.96 --> 4885.6
they're claiming

4884.0 --> 4887.84
regardless of if they say the ball comes

4885.6 --> 4889.04
back to your hand ball hits the side

4887.84 --> 4891.04
window because you're going around in a

4889.04 --> 4893.84
circle or ball hits the back window

4891.04 --> 4895.44
well they need it to deflect so in your

4893.84 --> 4897.679
example it would need them to be

4895.44 --> 4898.48
doing the same example but with a flat

4897.679 --> 4900.32
bed truck

4898.48 --> 4902.0
going round and round a roundabout

4900.32 --> 4902.799999999999
throwing a ball up in the air whilst on

4902.0 --> 4904.159
the roundabout

4902.8 --> 4906.0
and seeing it curve away from the

4904.159 --> 4906.32
flatbed truck because that would be the

4906.0 --> 4908.88
ball

4906.32 --> 4910.48
deviating from the motion that you

4908.88 --> 4911.1990000000005
observe on the back of the flat bed

4910.48 --> 4914.0
truck

4911.199 --> 4915.678999999999
i.e coriolis deflection not actual drift

4914.0 --> 4917.52
from your vantage point as you turn

4915.679 --> 4918.88
underneath the ball you've just thrown

4917.52 --> 4920.639
them showing the ball coming back to

4918.88 --> 4923.6
your hand on the flatbed truck

4920.639 --> 4924.0
is it not drifting away from you as they

4923.6 --> 4926.400000000001
claim

4924.0 --> 4928.48
earth has that's coriolis deflection

4926.4 --> 4931.04
stuff drifting away at 15 degrees an

4928.48 --> 4932.5599999999995
hour something that never happens

4931.04 --> 4934.48
not to mention they are with their

4932.56 --> 4937.1990000000005
explanations actually trying to say

4934.48 --> 4938.799999999999
earth is a closed system yeah you'd need

4937.199 --> 4940.0
earth to be like the car

4938.8 --> 4941.52
moving along with the atmosphere

4940.0 --> 4943.199
traveling along with it well that would

4941.52 --> 4944.4800000000005
violate the first law of thermodynamics

4943.199 --> 4947.199
on a spinning sphere

4944.48 --> 4948.5599999999995
because the increase of speed of the air

4947.199 --> 4949.599999999999
would have to be in effect as you went

4948.56 --> 4951.360000000001
up in altitude

4949.6 --> 4953.679
its circumference its journey would

4951.36 --> 4955.04
increase therefore the velocity would

4953.679 --> 4956.159
have to increase as you go up in

4955.04 --> 4958.96
altitude

4956.159 --> 4961.12
absolutely absurd same would apply for

4958.96 --> 4963.04
anything that's lifting off the ground

4961.12 --> 4964.4
so it takes off and to keep the momentum

4963.04 --> 4966.719
of the ground beneath it

4964.4 --> 4968.638999999999
which is a smaller circumference it

4966.719 --> 4970.2390000000005
would have to increase its velocity to

4968.639 --> 4973.36
match the ground beneath

4970.239 --> 4975.12
it would also not give you drift at 15

4973.36 --> 4977.92
degrees now that's them drifting apart

4975.12 --> 4977.92
from one another

4980.96 --> 4992.08
a little bit evidence a little pressure

4987.36 --> 4992.08
let's have a look oh

4992.239 --> 4995.919999999999
where's my master pointer there we go

4997.92 --> 5001.36
no sound but can you tell us what he's

4999.6 --> 5003.679
doing yeah i'll keep that off

5001.36 --> 5005.28
what's he telling us he's basically he's

5003.679 --> 5007.1990000000005
got he's going to fire this projectile

5005.28 --> 5009.199
up in the air he's just demonstrated it

5007.199 --> 5012.839999999999
with nothing now he's going to set it

5009.199 --> 5015.759999999999
rolling and fire the projectile out and

5012.84 --> 5018.56
you'll

5015.76 --> 5019.12
oh so he's firing it out and catching it

5018.56 --> 5021.6
yeah

5019.12 --> 5023.36
now he's got he's got a little cup on it

5021.6 --> 5026.0
obviously to give a bit of leeway but

5023.36 --> 5026.0
if you watch

5026.48 --> 5029.28
so he's

5031.92 --> 5036.56
can you show my screen yeah sure but

5034.8 --> 5038.400000000001
just while you're doing that

5036.56 --> 5040.400000000001
what that is is a demonstration that the

5038.4 --> 5044.48
two move together

5040.4 --> 5047.839999999999
synchronized not drifting apart

5044.48 --> 5048.5599999999995
but moving together like the trampoline

5047.84 --> 5051.76
guy

5048.56 --> 5054.080000000001
isn't drifting not demonstrating that

5051.76 --> 5056.719
they move apart 15 degrees an hour

5054.08 --> 5058.32
showing they move together completely

5056.719 --> 5060.4800000000005
annihilating the idea that we have a

5058.32 --> 5063.04
coriolis effect

5060.48 --> 5064.159
right you're up huntley do you see the

5063.04 --> 5067.44
apple thing

5064.159 --> 5069.199
yeah okay so let me so do you now see

5067.44 --> 5072.32
the coriolis effect window

5069.199 --> 5073.919999999999
yeah this is like an

5072.32 --> 5075.5199999999995
it's worth there's no we don't need the

5073.92 --> 5076.56
sound obviously but it's worth showing

5075.52 --> 5078.96
this because

5076.56 --> 5080.4800000000005
this illustrates the two points when the

5078.96 --> 5082.2390000000005
roundabout's not turning

5080.48 --> 5084.0
you can see that all four observers on

5082.239 --> 5085.5199999999995
the roundabout are able to freely throw

5084.0 --> 5087.12
the ball to and from each other without

5085.52 --> 5088.639
seeing any apparent drift

5087.12 --> 5089.92
and that's that's what you'd expect

5088.639 --> 5091.1990000000005
because it's not turning they're just

5089.92 --> 5092.08
able to throw it to each other no

5091.199 --> 5094.239
problem

5092.08 --> 5095.12
however when the when thing starts

5094.239 --> 5097.04
turning

5095.12 --> 5098.4
they see on the roundabout they see

5097.04 --> 5100.719
apparent drift

5098.4 --> 5102.638999999999
but the real observer on the outside the

5100.719 --> 5104.2390000000005
non-inertial frame of reference

5102.639 --> 5106.719
sees that the ball is still traveling

5104.239 --> 5108.638999999999
straight so the the apparent deflection

5106.719 --> 5110.88
is from the observer on the rotating

5108.639 --> 5112.2390000000005
platform which is not what we see in

5110.88 --> 5113.92
real world we don't see

5112.239 --> 5116.0
any observations real world where there

5113.92 --> 5117.679
is apparent drift because if we did we

5116.0 --> 5119.44
would see planes apparently drifting

5117.679 --> 5120.0
with times when they're flying east and

5119.44 --> 5123.28
west

5120.0 --> 5124.719
and we don't see that now when they try

5123.28 --> 5126.8
and argue against it

5124.719 --> 5128.88
they've got to try and argue against the

5126.8 --> 5131.04
apparent drift that that were not seen

5128.88 --> 5132.639
well that basically argues our case for

5131.04 --> 5134.159
us but they think it's arguing their

5132.639 --> 5135.6
case for them and it's not

5134.159 --> 5137.28
so they're arguing against their own

5135.6 --> 5139.04
model but don't realize it

5137.28 --> 5143.36
yeah well that's come to a fruition now

5139.04 --> 5143.36
thanks to simon dan and craig's helping

5144.0 --> 5148.32
yeah i've seen that one that's my

5145.76 --> 5148.320000000001
favorite one

5148.56 --> 5151.6
it's the only one that gives you that

5150.239 --> 5152.32
that it shows you the apparent

5151.6 --> 5154.400000000001
deflection

5152.32 --> 5156.4
and the the lack of apparent deflection

5154.4 --> 5158.719
from the non-inertial frame of reference

5156.4 --> 5161.199
then that's what you've got to visualize

5158.719 --> 5162.32
um with regards to planes or bullets or

5161.199 --> 5164.159
helicopters

5162.32 --> 5167.44
from the rotating frame of reference you

5164.159 --> 5167.44
may be in the universal

5167.84 --> 5172.08
i mean the inertial frame yeah from the

5170.639 --> 5174.0
rotating frame of reference or the

5172.08 --> 5176.159
inertial frame of reference we must

5174.0 --> 5176.159
see

5177.44 --> 5180.48
the reflections let me just clarify it

5179.92 --> 5183.52
apologies

5180.48 --> 5183.5199999999995
which is the non-inertial

5186.239 --> 5190.239
i just need to clarify it so it's clear

5188.88 --> 5192.56
non-inertial

5190.239 --> 5194.638999999999
is the reference frame you're on the

5192.56 --> 5197.4400000000005
reason it's described as non-inertial

5194.639 --> 5199.1990000000005
is because you're not moving you're

5197.44 --> 5201.839999999999
attached to the thing that is

5199.199 --> 5202.5599999999995
so as far as you're concerned you aren't

5201.84 --> 5204.8
moving

5202.56 --> 5206.2390000000005
non-inertial because the effect you're

5204.8 --> 5209.360000000001
going to be describing

5206.239 --> 5210.0
the not actual drift is going to be

5209.36 --> 5212.239
taking place

5210.0 --> 5214.08
in the inertial reference frame so it's

5212.239 --> 5215.678999999999
an item traveling in a straight line in

5214.08 --> 5218.159
a different frame of reference

5215.679 --> 5219.84
that's inertial from your vantage point

5218.159 --> 5223.599999999999
so you're going to see it

5219.84 --> 5225.84
seem to drift well that's from your

5223.6 --> 5227.679
non-inertial reference frame so you're

5225.84 --> 5229.4400000000005
going to witness something happening

5227.679 --> 5231.1990000000005
that would be the drift the thing coming

5229.44 --> 5232.159
towards you the oh no the tree's coming

5231.199 --> 5233.919999999999
to get me

5232.159 --> 5235.679
well that is taking place in the

5233.92 --> 5237.679
inertial reference frame the tree is

5235.679 --> 5239.4400000000005
moving towards you

5237.679 --> 5241.84
in the inertial reference frame in

5239.44 --> 5242.799999999999
reality it's not moving at all it's a

5241.84 --> 5245.52
tree

5242.8 --> 5246.719
but you see it seem to come towards you

5245.52 --> 5248.400000000001
and that's because your frame of

5246.719 --> 5251.6
reference describing this not

5248.4 --> 5252.879999999999
actual drift is non-inertial describing

5251.6 --> 5255.6
some inertia

5252.88 --> 5256.88
not actual inertia apparent inertia of a

5255.6 --> 5259.1990000000005
tree coming towards you

5256.88 --> 5263.1990000000005
as you spin towards it on your

5259.199 --> 5263.199
non-inertial spinning reference frame

5263.84 --> 5268.159000000001
so basically the conservation of

5266.96 --> 5269.6
momentum point

5268.159 --> 5271.04
doesn't work if we're on a curved

5269.6 --> 5272.159000000001
trajectory because we're supposed to be

5271.04 --> 5274.08
on a curve

5272.159 --> 5275.92
it doesn't work so their argument is

5274.08 --> 5277.199
flawed anyway their argument for

5275.92 --> 5279.28
something that shouldn't happen in their

5277.199 --> 5280.719
rhetoric is also flawed that's correct

5279.28 --> 5282.4
also i'm going to do another quick

5280.719 --> 5283.92
couple of shout outs because

5282.4 --> 5285.36
flat sword fe has actually covered this

5283.92 --> 5286.56
with his own demonstration as good as

5285.36 --> 5288.0
the national geographic one that might

5286.56 --> 5290.400000000001
get me a copyright strike was

5288.0 --> 5291.44
he has also done it so go and check out

5290.4 --> 5293.36
um

5291.44 --> 5294.96
flat swords channel and find his

5293.36 --> 5297.28
demonstration where he has a

5294.96 --> 5298.2390000000005
a camera phone attached to a fan and you

5297.28 --> 5299.679
can see what happens from the

5298.239 --> 5301.12
non-inertial spinning reference frame

5299.679 --> 5303.28
versus the inertial reference frame

5301.12 --> 5304.88
so go and check him out subscribe today

5303.28 --> 5305.36
he's in a bit of a tete at the moment

5304.88 --> 5307.28
with

5305.36 --> 5308.4
craig fight flat earth so you can check

5307.28 --> 5310.32
that out on facts

5308.4 --> 5312.48
flat side fe's channel if you can get my

5310.32 --> 5313.599999999999
tongue around it subscribe today

5312.48 --> 5314.879999999999
please let him know that i sent you

5313.6 --> 5316.08
leave him a little comment if you do go

5314.88 --> 5317.6
and subscribe that she says nathan

5316.08 --> 5320.0
oakley 1980 sent you

5317.6 --> 5321.6
also the reason i can so concisely

5320.0 --> 5322.0
describe non-inertial and inertial

5321.6 --> 5323.92
reference

5322.0 --> 5325.92
frames is because of paula who explained

5323.92 --> 5326.4
it to me so i can now detail it back to

5325.92 --> 5329.4400000000005
you

5326.4 --> 5330.799999999999
so that's purely down to her explanation

5329.44 --> 5332.4
because i didn't get it it's like why is

5330.8 --> 5333.679
it non-inertial if i'm spinning

5332.4 --> 5335.36
doesn't make any sense and then she

5333.679 --> 5337.52
broke it down for me now i can break it

5335.36 --> 5339.599999999999
down for you because i'm a subscriber

5337.52 --> 5340.639

other end of the

5356.159 --> 5361.28
extreme a very proactive youtuber josh

who's over at authentic intent channel

5361.28 --> 5364.96
so subscribe today

5362.56 --> 5366.96
to a thought authentic intent who as i

5364.96 --> 5368.88
say is a very very proactive

5366.96 --> 5370.96
uh youtuber goes out and about

5368.88 --> 5373.04
encourages conversation with his very

5370.96 --> 5374.639
very friendly and approachable demeanor

5373.04 --> 5376.159
so he's a really nice youtuber to watch

5374.639 --> 5379.28
and relax too

5376.159 --> 5380.96
does the controversy he's deceptive

5379.28 --> 5382.8
might be amiable might be approachable

5380.96 --> 5384.08
but he does definitely catch people out

5382.8 --> 5385.360000000001
and give him a bit of a shock when he

5384.08 --> 5385.92
talks to him so that's the third link

5385.36 --> 5389.04

5391.04 --> 5396.8
authentic intent bible literalist

5394.239 --> 5398.638999999999
and flat sword fe who are all

5396.8 --> 5400.0
exceptionally good youtubers and you

5398.639 --> 5403.04
need to just let them know that i sent

5400.0 --> 5403.04
you to subscribe

5403.52 --> 5410.080000000001
so yeah i just like to say go on here

5407.28 --> 5410.719
i was just gonna say so you're saying

5410.08 --> 5412.88
the

5410.719 --> 5414.32
the roundabout is spinning but you're on

5412.88 --> 5416.8
it you're not moving

5414.32 --> 5418.239
correct personally yeah the the effect

5416.8 --> 5421.12
you're gonna describe

5418.239 --> 5422.239
is a not actual effect but to have a not

5421.12 --> 5424.239
actual effect

5422.239 --> 5426.5599999999995
you've got to be on a platform that's

5424.239 --> 5427.12
moving but you're not moving in relation

5426.56 --> 5428.719
to

5427.12 --> 5430.4
so therefore you're non-inertial

5428.719 --> 5434.56
describing a not actual effect

5430.4 --> 5436.4
it's very confusing

5434.56 --> 5439.04
i have a problem with the video that

5436.4 --> 5442.239
adam showed with the linear momentum

5439.04 --> 5444.48
that ball was sent up in half a loop

5442.239 --> 5445.839999999999
it makes half a loop it doesn't go

5444.48 --> 5447.44
straight up in the air

5445.84 --> 5449.679
and conserve the momentum come straight

5447.44 --> 5452.08
back down it's sent up

5449.679 --> 5453.28
in time to land back in the thing it

5452.08 --> 5454.88
doesn't look like it's

5453.28 --> 5456.5599999999995
like the whole thing is correct it looks

5454.88 --> 5458.400000000001
like it's a little bit of a porous

5456.56 --> 5460.400000000001
no no i disagree if if what you're

5458.4 --> 5462.32
saying was correct

5460.4 --> 5464.0
it could only go up directly straight

5462.32 --> 5465.599999999999
like 90 degrees

5464.0 --> 5467.28
and it's not it's definitely not doing

5465.6 --> 5469.6
that is it

5467.28 --> 5470.4
no it seems to be sent forward it seems

5469.6 --> 5472.320000000001
to be sent

5470.4 --> 5473.839999999999
up forward so it does land in the thing

5472.32 --> 5475.12
but that's the point it's conserving the

5473.84 --> 5478.2390000000005
momentum of the

5475.12 --> 5479.599999999999
pushing forward yeah but it's

5478.239 --> 5481.678999999999
proving the thing they're trying to

5479.6 --> 5482.719
prove but the thing is the ball is not

5481.679 --> 5485.12
sent straight up

5482.719 --> 5486.2390000000005
it's been sent as the thing before the

5485.12 --> 5488.639
thing even gets moving

5486.239 --> 5489.759999999999
it's been sent in a loop all right sorry

5488.639 --> 5492.159000000001
it's been sent up

5489.76 --> 5493.6
forward so it does come back down at

5492.159 --> 5495.44
least somewhere near where

5493.6 --> 5497.679
if not in at least somewhere near where

5495.44 --> 5501.5199999999995
the thing is going to be yeah

5497.679 --> 5502.2390000000005
it looks like a departure moving first

5501.52 --> 5504.320000000001
i'll share

5502.239 --> 5505.44
i'll show you yeah before you do just

5504.32 --> 5508.5599999999995
before you do i just wanna

5505.44 --> 5512.32
i completely agree with you brian but

5508.56 --> 5512.719
if this succeeds as a demonstration of

5512.32 --> 5514.96
the

5512.719 --> 5517.52
conservation of momentum regardless if

5514.96 --> 5520.96
you want to argue that it's not angular

5517.52 --> 5522.56
it's not drifting their example is the

5520.96 --> 5524.159
earth is demonstrated to be spinning

5522.56 --> 5525.92
because we have 15 degrees now

5524.159 --> 5527.36
deviation as earth turns underneath

5525.92 --> 5529.28
stuff not attached

5527.36 --> 5530.799999999999
so this example wonderful yeah great

5529.28 --> 5532.159
demonstration of the retention of

5530.8 --> 5534.56
angular velocity

5532.159 --> 5536.48
okay but earth's supposed to have

5534.56 --> 5537.1990000000005
deviation at 15 degrees now as we turn

5536.48 --> 5539.28
underneath

5537.199 --> 5540.32
so it's proving what now nothing for the

5539.28 --> 5541.36
globe

5540.32 --> 5542.719
with that i'm going to say if you are

5541.36 --> 5544.48
watching this on either nathan oakley

5542.719 --> 5546.0

[Music]

5613.6 --> 5616.719
quick shout out to james richard who

5615.44 --> 5619.759999999999
says off topic

5616.719 --> 5622.96
but true satan's globe creation is over

5619.76 --> 5625.04
this will and is separating the tear

5622.96 --> 5626.719
tears from the wheat the goat from the

5625.04 --> 5627.76
sheep thank you very much indeed for

5626.719 --> 5631.52
smashing the super chat

5627.76 --> 5635.6
james richard

5631.52 --> 5638.0
i don't know just sound choppy

5635.6 --> 5639.4400000000005
choppy i think he was thinking he was

5638.0 --> 5640.96
thinking a super chat while i was

5639.44 --> 5642.32
talking so i stopped talking

5640.96 --> 5645.84
i had your line clothes while i was

5642.32 --> 5645.84
doing that

5647.04 --> 5650.88
i got a couple of questions from chris

5648.639 --> 5654.32
first go ahead chris

5650.88 --> 5655.12
oh yeah i was um another show ended up

5654.32 --> 5658.719
trying to get to

5655.12 --> 5661.76
the gas pressure bit so in

5658.719 --> 5665.44
um in lieu of my hot air balloon

5661.76 --> 5667.12
call i'm gonna call a vacuum company

5665.44 --> 5668.5599999999995
i've already been emailing with them so

5667.12 --> 5670.4
i'm gonna call here in a little bit and

5668.56 --> 5672.8
record it as well

5670.4 --> 5674.4
so i was going to see if there's any

5672.8 --> 5678.639
questions you all can come up

5674.4 --> 5680.5599999999995
with that i should ask um in that call

5678.639 --> 5683.36
yeah how can you have gas pressure

5680.56 --> 5683.360000000001
without a container

5683.44 --> 5686.879999999999
i'll get an estimate if they can create

5685.84 --> 5689.119000000001
a vacuum

5686.88 --> 5690.159000000001
without a container equally good

5689.119 --> 5691.839999999999
chocolate's question

5690.159 --> 5694.4
how can you have a valley again without

5691.84 --> 5697.4400000000005
a container

5694.4 --> 5699.04
okay the same question but for the

5697.44 --> 5700.239
vacuum rather than for the gas pressure

5699.04 --> 5704.08
basically

5700.239 --> 5707.04
right so in the email i taught i just

5704.08 --> 5708.8
asked him i sent them the clip of people

5707.04 --> 5709.84
putting you know building these homemade

5708.8 --> 5712.08
vacuums and putting

5709.84 --> 5712.88
you know little bitty i don't know what

5712.08 --> 5714.96
to call it

5712.88 --> 5716.56
fire fire-powered rockets in and you

5714.96 --> 5718.88
know turning them on and saying oh look

5716.56 --> 5720.8
they work inside of a vacuum

5718.88 --> 5722.96
and so i sent him that and said hey what

5720.8 --> 5724.2390000000005
do you think of this you know and i was

5722.96 --> 5726.56
gonna see if you had any time for other

5724.239 --> 5728.08
questions blah blah blah and

5726.56 --> 5729.92
the guy who's the president of this

5728.08 --> 5730.88
vacuum company they create they create

5729.92 --> 5732.32
vacuums

5730.88 --> 5733.6
and they work on vacuum so like they're

5732.32 --> 5734.32
just you know they just know a lot about

5733.6 --> 5737.52
it

5734.32 --> 5739.28
um he said well first of all the vacuum

5737.52 --> 5741.76
the gas is filling the vacuum almost

5739.28 --> 5745.28
instantly it's like so that's

5741.76 --> 5747.280000000001
you know that's a that's a problem um

5745.28 --> 5748.96
and then he's like the pr the pressure

5747.28 --> 5750.159
inside is he's like i'm surprised that

5748.96 --> 5750.96
that thing didn't blow up from the

5750.159 --> 5753.44
pressure

5750.96 --> 5754.4
from the pressure he says that that they

5753.44 --> 5756.799999999999
created inside

5754.4 --> 5758.638999999999
the supposed vacuum that was no longer a

5756.8 --> 5759.360000000001
vacuum once it filled with the gas from

5758.639 --> 5762.719
the rocket

5759.36 --> 5764.4
so this guy's already spot on to there

5762.719 --> 5766.56
to the deception of them trying to

5764.4 --> 5768.638999999999
i've got a question you could ask him

5766.56 --> 5771.119000000001
because if you go and look at

5768.639 --> 5771.84
rob durham's channel he he did this

5771.119 --> 5774.96
years ago

5771.84 --> 5775.6
uh setting off a firework and attached

5774.96 --> 5777.92
it to a little

5775.6 --> 5779.6
toy so it'd go along the thing and we

5777.92 --> 5781.36
discussed it back then and

5779.6 --> 5783.04
that was the initial critique you may

5781.36 --> 5784.32
have well evacuated the chamber but the

5783.04 --> 5787.6
second

5784.32 --> 5791.5199999999995
that um rocket fires the gas

5787.6 --> 5793.1990000000005
as it's got suddenly stop the vacuum and

5791.52 --> 5794.320000000001
the longer it burns the more and more

5793.199 --> 5796.0
atmosphere you're creating for the

5794.32 --> 5799.119
rocket to push against

5796.0 --> 5800.4
so my question to them would be what

5799.119 --> 5802.799999999999
would the

5800.4 --> 5804.239
size of a chamber need to be and what

5802.8 --> 5806.56
would the evacuation

5804.239 --> 5808.32
rate of that chamber need to be for you

5806.56 --> 5810.719
able to fire a rocket

5808.32 --> 5813.28
in a chamber for you to demonstrate the

5810.719 --> 5815.28
effect of it firing in space which is an

5813.28 --> 5816.639
infinite vacuum

5815.28 --> 5818.96
well you'd have to have the same rate as

5816.639 --> 5820.719
the gas was produced whatever the rate

5818.96 --> 5822.8
the gas was being produced out in

5820.719 --> 5825.04
liters per second you'd have to have the

5822.8 --> 5827.52
evacuation rate identical or higher

5825.04 --> 5828.4
it wouldn't matter if it was higher but

5827.52 --> 5831.280000000001
the

5828.4 --> 5832.96
point being it shows that no uh none of

5831.28 --> 5835.44
these experiments or tests

5832.96 --> 5837.119
that the demonstrations that would go on

5835.44 --> 5840.159
uh have any validity

5837.119 --> 5841.759999999999
because unless you've got that

5840.159 --> 5843.5199999999995
where you're matching the rate of

5841.76 --> 5844.88
production so that there is nothing to

5843.52 --> 5846.719
push against but

5844.88 --> 5848.08
in all these the little chambers the the

5846.719 --> 5849.52
gas is coming out at

5848.08 --> 5850.8
thousands of miles an hour it's hitting

5849.52 --> 5852.56
that chamber coming back and giving

5850.8 --> 5855.84
something for the other

5852.56 --> 5858.2390000000005
uh ejection policy to push against

5855.84 --> 5860.2390000000005
which is not what should be happening in

5858.239 --> 5861.119
any simulation that that particle should

5860.239 --> 5863.919999999999
come out

5861.119 --> 5864.719
and carry on forever shouldn't it um

5863.92 --> 5866.2390000000005
that now we're going

5864.719 --> 5867.44
at the end of the explanation which i

5866.239 --> 5869.119
completely agree with and i saw rob

5867.44 --> 5869.759999999999
dolan's example with his vacuum over the

5869.119 --> 5871.5199999999995
back of the

5869.76 --> 5873.360000000001
jet basically showing that if you've

5871.52 --> 5874.080000000001
sucked away the pressure that's created

5873.36 --> 5876.5599999999995
by the

5874.08 --> 5877.679
the rocket then it's not going anywhere

5876.56 --> 5879.280000000001
then you just literally shoved the

5877.679 --> 5882.159
vacuum at the back of the jet

5879.28 --> 5882.5599999999995
and bye bye was the movement no movement

5882.159 --> 5883.759999999999
well

5882.56 --> 5885.92
that's all well and good other than the

5883.76 --> 5886.719
fact that we couldn't have a sky vacuum

5885.92 --> 5888.8
to begin with

5886.719 --> 5890.56
so we're arguing about a fake place so

5888.8 --> 5891.360000000001
without the container there could be no

5890.56 --> 5893.119000000001
pressure

5891.36 --> 5894.96
and the sky is claimed to be a vacuum

5893.119 --> 5895.759999999999
well arguing about what a vacuum might

5894.96 --> 5897.6
or might not do

5895.76 --> 5899.1990000000005
doesn't in any way justify the fact that

5897.6 --> 5900.56
people think the sky is a vacuum

5899.199 --> 5903.04
but we wouldn't have any gas to breathe

5900.56 --> 5903.04
if it was

5903.36 --> 5907.36
can i uh so now they're done with

5905.28 --> 5908.719
they're saying it's already done

5907.36 --> 5911.199
just like chris get to the end of his

5908.719 --> 5914.4800000000005
point okay press

5911.199 --> 5915.759999999999
yeah so oh sorry so adam or whoever's

5914.48 --> 5918.159
was saying so rob had

5915.76 --> 5918.88
rob did do that where he put a vacuum

5918.159 --> 5921.92
next to

5918.88 --> 5925.36
some some exhaust and

5921.92 --> 5927.36
yeah i'll i'll find you the

5925.36 --> 5928.719
clips like if you give me a second it's

5927.36 --> 5930.5599999999995
like a bottle rocket on a

5928.719 --> 5932.32
on a toy car it's not in a vacuum

5930.56 --> 5932.8
chamber it's just showing that if you

5932.32 --> 5937.599999999999
remove

5932.8 --> 5939.119000000001
the uh the what you call it propellant

5937.6 --> 5940.639
is that the right term once it's coming

5939.119 --> 5942.719
out the back of the rocket

5940.639 --> 5945.1990000000005
once you remove that it's got nothing to

5942.719 --> 5947.44
push up on so if you suck it away

5945.199 --> 5949.36
as an infinite vacuum would do then

5947.44 --> 5951.28
you've got nothing for it to push upon

5949.36 --> 5953.44
exactly as you described and the guy

5951.28 --> 5955.84
from the vacuum company described

5953.44 --> 5957.36
but my point is that why would you argue

5955.84 --> 5958.4800000000005
about whether or not a rocket would work

5957.36 --> 5962.32
in space

5958.48 --> 5962.32
when the sky is not a vacuum

5962.639 --> 5966.400000000001
all right it's babies that would relate

5964.56 --> 5967.679
back to the first question of can you

5966.4 --> 5971.5199999999995
have a vacuum

5967.679 --> 5971.52
without a container

5976.8 --> 5980.400000000001
no no i was just joking i was saying

5978.4 --> 5983.5199999999995
well yeah i mean i absolutely agree but

5980.4 --> 5986.32
baby steps right for a lot of people who

5983.52 --> 5988.0
want to see that or know that it's a lot

5986.32 --> 5988.719
of people don't want to go straight to

5988.0 --> 5990.32
the

5988.719 --> 5991.84
common sense answer of what you just

5990.32 --> 5993.36
said they want to say oh well i want to

5991.84 --> 5995.1990000000005
see it you know i want to see this

5993.36 --> 5997.36
that this rocket not working due to

5995.199 --> 5998.799999999999
being in a vacuum kind of thing

5997.36 --> 6001.04
yeah because they want to have hold on

5998.8 --> 6003.4400000000005
to the idea that space may or

6001.04 --> 6004.96
may not have vacuums it may or may not

6003.44 --> 6006.879999999999
have rockets capable of working in it

6004.96 --> 6008.159
but the overarching idea of space still

6006.88 --> 6009.84
being real is still

6008.159 --> 6011.759999999999
cemented in the idea of both debatable

6009.84 --> 6013.04
when you win your argument the rockets

6011.76 --> 6014.639
wouldn't work in space

6013.04 --> 6016.239
so we've still got space then oh well

6014.639 --> 6018.56
they don't work in space but we've still

6016.239 --> 6020.5599999999995
got space

6018.56 --> 6023.280000000001
they don't want to hear spaces fake in

6020.56 --> 6025.6
other words

6023.28 --> 6027.199
ask him uh at what altitude entropy

6025.6 --> 6030.320000000001
stops working

6027.199 --> 6031.04
no now it doesn't talk about entropy

6030.32 --> 6033.92
doesn't stop

6031.04 --> 6036.08
working at a certain altitude entity

6033.92 --> 6039.28
stops working

6036.08 --> 6040.5599999999995
hey then i'll stop aging yeah well no

6039.28 --> 6044.08
that was my point though

6040.56 --> 6044.080000000001
the question would just mess him up

6046.8 --> 6051.4400000000005
he stops working and starts working in

6048.84 --> 6052.719
reverse and gas starts coming back down

6051.44 --> 6055.5199999999995
mostly down

6052.719 --> 6056.639
fall down go boom boom go splash splash

6055.52 --> 6059.1990000000005
i mean

6056.639 --> 6061.36
what the hell man might as well ask him

6059.199 --> 6064.5599999999995
there

6061.36 --> 6067.28
so back to adam's uh video

6064.56 --> 6068.320000000001
he showed that before he pushed the

6067.28 --> 6070.639
mechanism

6068.32 --> 6072.48
on the rail the ball went straight up

6070.639 --> 6075.84
and down then when he

6072.48 --> 6076.5599999999995
pushed it at a certain speed the ball

6075.84 --> 6080.08
went up

6076.56 --> 6083.6
and met the thing at a future point

6080.08 --> 6088.08
and caught it that reminded me of me

6083.6 --> 6090.719
as a kid running and throwing a baseball

6088.08 --> 6091.84
and catching it while i'm running but i

6090.719 --> 6094.0
also realize

6091.84 --> 6095.360000000001
that if i don't throw it just right it's

6094.0 --> 6096.0
either going to be too far in front of

6095.36 --> 6097.599999999999
me

6096.0 --> 6099.199
or it's going to be behind me and i got

6097.6 --> 6100.96
to reach back to catch it while i'm

6099.199 --> 6103.04
still running forward

6100.96 --> 6105.28
so this is a very simple thing here you

6103.04 --> 6107.92
got the momentum of the person running

6105.28 --> 6109.44
throwing the ball at a synchronized

6107.92 --> 6111.1990000000005
speed to the run

6109.44 --> 6112.638999999999
it's going to come up and down precisely

6111.199 --> 6114.5599999999995
where your hand is because

6112.639 --> 6116.639
you feel that motion and what you got to

6114.56 --> 6117.92
do with it but if you throw a little too

6116.639 --> 6121.84
much or low two less

6117.92 --> 6121.84
it's it's going to go off

6121.92 --> 6128.96
exactly what drift drift you mean

6125.92 --> 6131.1990000000005
yeah from the intended path

6128.96 --> 6135.36
yeah yeah that's what they need earth to

6131.199 --> 6137.04
do it just doesn't do it

6135.36 --> 6138.799999999999
that was part of what i was saying

6137.04 --> 6141.5199999999995
concerning that video is that

6138.8 --> 6142.88
it was very timed and he also put a

6141.52 --> 6145.1990000000005
funnel on

6142.88 --> 6146.639
when he put the thing moving whereas he

6145.199 --> 6147.36
when he first showed the ball going up

6146.639 --> 6149.28
in the air

6147.36 --> 6151.04
he didn't have the funnel and the ball

6149.28 --> 6153.28
went more up straighter

6151.04 --> 6154.32
more straight in the air if he didn't

6153.28 --> 6155.5199999999995
have that right time

6154.32 --> 6158.5599999999995
there's no way that ball is going to

6155.52 --> 6158.56
come back down into that

6159.119 --> 6162.5599999999995
maybe maybe not but either way it's not

6161.04 --> 6165.679
drift

6162.56 --> 6167.360000000001
so yeah yeah we could argue all day we

6165.679 --> 6169.04
could argue all day

6167.36 --> 6170.4
this proving that we have conservation

6169.04 --> 6172.48
of angular momentum

6170.4 --> 6173.759999999999
but then we've got an example if they

6172.48 --> 6175.04
prove their point

6173.76 --> 6176.56
where there's no difference between a

6175.04 --> 6178.56
stationary earth and a turning earth

6176.56 --> 6180.639
there's no discernible proof of either

6178.56 --> 6182.080000000001
well what's that proving well nothing

6180.639 --> 6183.84
because their claim isn't that

6182.08 --> 6185.199
things move with earth as it turns

6183.84 --> 6187.28
because they assume it turns

6185.199 --> 6188.48
with no discernible effect versus a

6187.28 --> 6189.759999999999
stationary earth

6188.48 --> 6191.36
they're supposed to have it drifting

6189.76 --> 6192.639
apart 15 degrees now i'm going to say

6191.36 --> 6194.639
this the whole time

6192.639 --> 6196.400000000001
until i'm blue in the face there's

6194.639 --> 6199.679
supposed to be turning underneath

6196.4 --> 6199.679
that's correct that's correct

6201.52 --> 6204.88
we're talking about linear momentum

6203.36 --> 6207.199
that's an example of

6204.88 --> 6209.4400000000005
supposed to be linear momentum whether

6207.199 --> 6210.638999999999
it claims angular momentum

6209.44 --> 6212.48
that's what he's telling you is the

6210.639 --> 6213.92
problem man i'm not talking about this

6212.48 --> 6215.36
momentum

6213.92 --> 6216.8
we're supposed to be talking about an

6215.36 --> 6217.839999999999
observation from a non-inertial

6216.8 --> 6218.96
reference frame that's called the

6217.84 --> 6221.76
coriolis effect

6218.96 --> 6223.52
exactly exactly we're not talking about

6221.76 --> 6224.2390000000005
conservation momentum as much as they

6223.52 --> 6225.679
want to

6224.239 --> 6227.678999999999
make the argument about whether or not

6225.679 --> 6229.28
it's conservation momentum that's not

6227.679 --> 6230.88
their argument their argument is earth

6229.28 --> 6232.239
turns underneath stuff not attached at

6230.88 --> 6234.32
15 degrees an hour

6232.239 --> 6236.799999999999
no it conserves momentum that's not

6234.32 --> 6236.799999999999
their claim

6237.52 --> 6241.119000000001
yeah but i think what brian's saying is

6239.119 --> 6243.5199999999995
they got that wrong too

6241.119 --> 6245.119
they can't even get that right yeah they

6243.52 --> 6246.8
can't even get their false claim of

6245.119 --> 6248.32
conservation correct yes i see what

6246.8 --> 6250.88
brian's saying now yeah thanks

6248.32 --> 6251.679
neil you guys you guys remember my story

6250.88 --> 6253.679
of my

6251.679 --> 6255.76
four-wheel drive truck and we were at

6253.679 --> 6256.96
camp in the mountains and the kids said

6255.76 --> 6258.719
hey let's go for a ride

6256.96 --> 6260.0
and i took them for a ride and there's i

6258.719 --> 6262.08
don't know five kids in the back

6260.0 --> 6263.6
or something and i'm watching them in

6262.08 --> 6264.88
the rearview mirror and they're hanging

6263.6 --> 6267.360000000001
on and i go over this

6264.88 --> 6268.88
bump uh it was like a speed bump kind of

6267.36 --> 6272.5599999999995
a bump not too big

6268.88 --> 6274.56
and they lifted off the bed of the truck

6272.56 --> 6276.4800000000005
they couldn't hang on to the rails they

6274.56 --> 6278.400000000001
were freely in the air

6276.48 --> 6280.159
and i'm moving from underneath them and

6278.4 --> 6282.08
they all landed in different spots of

6280.159 --> 6285.36
that truck

6282.08 --> 6287.44
right so conservation of momentum is one

6285.36 --> 6290.239
thing you will leave the object with it

6287.44 --> 6291.28
okay but the object underneath the earth

6290.239 --> 6294.0
or the truck

6291.28 --> 6295.28
is still having work applied to it to

6294.0 --> 6297.44
continue

6295.28 --> 6299.36
it moving at that speed now when you

6297.44 --> 6300.48
leave you've got that but you will lose

6299.36 --> 6302.719
it

6300.48 --> 6304.959999999999
okay so the atm that you you bumping

6302.719 --> 6306.96
into other air molecules will slow you

6304.96 --> 6310.08
down you may leave at the same speed

6306.96 --> 6310.08
that's why luanne

6310.4 --> 6313.839999999999
on the thing to catch it because there

6311.92 --> 6315.36
will be

6313.84 --> 6316.96
adam don't forget that the object

6315.36 --> 6319.04
underneath you with the earth is not

6316.96 --> 6321.6
following a straight path underneath you

6319.04 --> 6323.679
it's curving that that that's that's

6321.6 --> 6326.0
that's a separate point one one

6323.679 --> 6327.92
the point making that the ballers imply

6326.0 --> 6330.32
that you carry this forever

6327.92 --> 6331.28
no matter what you encounter that but

6330.32 --> 6333.679
that that

6331.28 --> 6335.599999999999
momentum is maintained it's not

6333.679 --> 6337.84
maintained you just leave with it

6335.6 --> 6340.639
it will then depreciate it doesn't you

6337.84 --> 6345.84
don't carry on at that speed forever

6340.639 --> 6345.84
yes correct i agree with that

6346.48 --> 6348.959999999999
indeed

6350.32 --> 6358.96
wrong hey i was just gonna say

6354.239 --> 6358.959999999999
globbers where you

6369.6 --> 6373.360000000001
hang on before this gets going i want to

6371.6 --> 6374.96
say ed you're welcome to sit in the back

6373.36 --> 6376.799999999999
of my truck any time and i'll prove it

6374.96 --> 6379.28
to you

6376.8 --> 6381.76
so no drift now in the back right no

6379.28 --> 6384.719
drift then

6381.76 --> 6387.84
hey ed does he uh does the earth rotate

6384.719 --> 6387.84
underneath a pendulum

6388.56 --> 6392.96
i don't care can you ask it in the form

6390.719 --> 6401.84
of a rat

6392.96 --> 6401.84
please don't care oh

6402.4 --> 6406.879999999999
oh shut the [ __ ] up with your gay ass

6404.4 --> 6406.879999999999
tactics

6407.04 --> 6410.8
no needs easy easy

6411.28 --> 6419.04
yeah you're mad wow

6414.8 --> 6421.4400000000005
so how how may we help you uh

6419.04 --> 6422.8
yeah so what's the definition of so yeah

6421.44 --> 6424.799999999999
stop talking please what's the

6422.8 --> 6427.84
definition of coriolis again

6424.8 --> 6429.28
nathan can you read it for

6427.84 --> 6430.8
sorry we just asked you about whether or

6429.28 --> 6432.0
not earth turns underneath the pendulum

6430.8 --> 6433.1990000000005
and you said you didn't care

6432.0 --> 6435.679
but you think we should honor your

6433.199 --> 6435.678999999999
questions

6435.92 --> 6439.36
well we don't care about yourself we

6437.92 --> 6440.08
don't care we don't know what's the

6439.36 --> 6442.0
definition

6440.08 --> 6443.199
we don't care you don't have any

6442.0 --> 6444.08
choreography definitions turning

6443.199 --> 6446.239
underneath anything

6444.08 --> 6447.92
you know nobody cares no you don't you

6446.239 --> 6450.48
decide what's the definition

6447.92 --> 6452.639
not the one you're using ed that's don't

6450.48 --> 6456.4
know that's it

6452.639 --> 6456.400000000001
are we we don't know everything be quiet

6481.119 --> 6485.839999999999
mike sasha

6487.6 --> 6490.96
anyone yeah it's on screen for my

6489.52 --> 6494.159000000001
audience with the game

6490.96 --> 6496.4800000000005
showing it how about yeah

6494.159 --> 6499.839999999999
i mean i'm not uh can't watch it of

6496.48 --> 6499.839999999999
course it's the after show so

6501.679 --> 6505.4400000000005
that you don't know what this ed what's

6503.92 --> 6506.96
your point

6505.44 --> 6508.719
you wouldn't answer a question about

6506.96 --> 6509.44
your globe earth claim with fukults

6508.719 --> 6510.639
pendulum

6509.44 --> 6512.4
but yet you want to challenge me on a

6510.639 --> 6514.639
definition i've got up on screen to read

6512.4 --> 6516.4
it to you why are you illiterate yeah

6514.639 --> 6518.639
you've been talking about it for over an

6516.4 --> 6520.08
hour so what's the definition then

6518.639 --> 6521.76
sorry it's your claim maybe you should

6520.08 --> 6522.96
tell us given you claim it for your

6521.76 --> 6524.56
globe earth that spins

6522.96 --> 6526.4800000000005
it's not my claim i don't make this

6524.56 --> 6528.159000000001
claim why would i define coriolis so i'm

6526.48 --> 6529.28
not claiming it you stupid idiot you're

6528.159 --> 6532.48
talking about it

6529.28 --> 6534.8
sorry you claim it on your side are you

6532.48 --> 6534.799999999999
deaf

6535.76 --> 6538.96
i'm not claiming your strum and

6537.36 --> 6541.28
arguments oh so i

6538.96 --> 6543.44
claim coriolis deviation as earth turns

6541.28 --> 6545.44
underneath at 15 degrees an hour do i

6543.44 --> 6547.919999999999
i need to define it because i'm claiming

6545.44 --> 6547.919999999999
it am i

6548.159 --> 6552.08
so that's the definition sorry am i

6551.119 --> 6554.5599999999995
claiming

6552.08 --> 6555.119
coriolis deviation in any way shape or

6554.56 --> 6557.76
form

6555.119 --> 6558.48
to need to define it or is this your

6557.76 --> 6561.679
claim

6558.48 --> 6564.239
that you refused when we asked you about

6561.679 --> 6565.76
the cult so this isn't my claim i've

6564.239 --> 6567.598999999999
suddenly got to justify

6565.76 --> 6570.56
it's your claim that when asked about

6567.599 --> 6572.88
you said you didn't care

6570.56 --> 6573.84
is your claim major no i don't oh it's

6572.88 --> 6576.88
my claim

6573.84 --> 6576.88
sorry who said that

6577.44 --> 6583.44
who says it's my claim virus

6580.56 --> 6583.84
do you want to show me an example where

6583.44 --> 6588.879999999999
i

6583.84 --> 6588.88
claim coriolis effect for something go

6589.28 --> 6592.639
you are giving us a straw man version of

6591.36 --> 6593.28
coriolis which makes it your

6592.639 --> 6596.639
choreography

6593.28 --> 6599.679
are you deaf tell me where i claim this

6596.639 --> 6599.679
you stupid idiot

6600.239 --> 6605.199
every time you talk about coriolis where

6602.48 --> 6608.159
do i claim coriolis deflection in

6605.199 --> 6608.159
anything ever

6608.56 --> 6616.2390000000005
on the globe i don't claim the earth's

6611.679 --> 6618.2390000000005
globe you do you stupid idiot

6616.239 --> 6619.839999999999
yeah you're playing i don't think uh are

6618.239 --> 6624.32
you thick

6619.84 --> 6627.28
are you dense when i claim a globe virus

6624.32 --> 6627.28
i don't

6627.599 --> 6633.119000000001
i say when you claim the globe sorry who

6629.679 --> 6633.119
claims the globe me or you

6633.44 --> 6638.32
i do you do so me defining coriolis

6637.84 --> 6641.84
something

6638.32 --> 6644.0
you claim and doesn't happen on earth

6641.84 --> 6645.679
would require me to justify the

6644.0 --> 6647.36
definition of something i don't claim

6645.679 --> 6650.96
and you do

6647.36 --> 6653.119
no this is your claim globe [ __ ]

6650.96 --> 6654.159
i'm not strawmanning anything with my

6653.119 --> 6656.96
description of how

6654.159 --> 6660.48
coriolis works on a globe i don't claim

6656.96 --> 6660.4800000000005
we're on a globe you do

6661.119 --> 6665.199
just draw me my straw man claim of

6664.08 --> 6668.96
coriolis

6665.199 --> 6668.96
where do i claim that [ __ ]

6670.08 --> 6675.36
the last hour oh so i claim we have

6673.199 --> 6676.5599999999995
deflection at 15 degrees now as earth

6675.36 --> 6681.44
turns underneath

6676.56 --> 6684.4800000000005
i claim that do i you complete [ __ ]

6681.44 --> 6687.598999999999
you guys are stressed out

6684.48 --> 6689.759999999999
he doesn't understand he just explains

6687.599 --> 6691.679
to them yeah he doesn't understand

6689.76 --> 6694.88
coriolis effect is real

6691.679 --> 6698.2390000000005
it just doesn't happen on earth but you

6694.88 --> 6699.1990000000005
claim it does and you're telling me to

6698.239 --> 6702.48
justify

6699.199 --> 6704.08
how your claim doesn't work by defining

6702.48 --> 6706.48
the thing you claim

6704.08 --> 6707.76
on a globe earth that spins that'll be

6706.48 --> 6710.32
coriolis effect

6707.76 --> 6712.400000000001
i've got to justify it have i i'm not

6710.32 --> 6714.88
claiming it you retards

6712.4 --> 6714.879999999999
you are

6715.599 --> 6723.52
justify your strom and it's not my claim

6720.08 --> 6726.08
how thick are you

6723.52 --> 6728.2390000000005
uh hello let's just get it clear for

6726.08 --> 6731.5199999999995
these two complete idiots

6728.239 --> 6734.839999999999
i do not claim coriolis effect

6731.52 --> 6736.320000000001
ever for anything under any

6734.84 --> 6739.92
circumstances

6736.32 --> 6743.04
i don't need coriolis deflection

6739.92 --> 6744.96
but the globe does you claim

6743.04 --> 6747.199
earth turns underneath stuff not

6744.96 --> 6750.4800000000005
attached to 15 degrees an hour

6747.199 --> 6753.919999999999
to give you and your globe

6750.48 --> 6757.04
acclaimed proof it spins that'll be you

6753.92 --> 6757.76
utilizing coriolis effect to make your

6757.04 --> 6760.159
claim

6757.76 --> 6761.04
the earth turns underneath at 15 degrees

6760.159 --> 6763.598999999999
an hour

6761.04 --> 6764.32
if earth turned underneath at 15 degrees

6763.599 --> 6768.08
an hour

6764.32 --> 6771.679
things would deflect they don't

6768.08 --> 6773.5199999999995
that's your claim being debunked

6771.679 --> 6774.719
i don't need to now justify what

6773.52 --> 6777.76
coriolis is

6774.719 --> 6780.0
it's your claim i'm destroying

6777.76 --> 6781.280000000001
now maybe you'd like to tell us how

6780.0 --> 6783.44
coriolis works

6781.28 --> 6785.5199999999995
and how it proves earth spinning rather

6783.44 --> 6787.678999999999
than demanding i justify

6785.52 --> 6789.76
the definition for something i don't

6787.679 --> 6792.96
claim on your model

6789.76 --> 6794.159000000001
i debunk it

6792.96 --> 6796.639
there's still something you made up

6794.159 --> 6798.719
regardless i made up coriolis effect

6796.639 --> 6800.2390000000005
no you throw a ball off a roundabout it

6798.719 --> 6801.92
seems to curve away from you that's a

6800.239 --> 6802.638999999999
very real effect that you claim happens

6801.92 --> 6807.04
on earth

6802.639 --> 6809.84
it just doesn't

6807.04 --> 6811.199
hey this is your coriolis oh it's my

6809.84 --> 6813.599
coriolis are you so

6811.199 --> 6814.719
stupid as you still really feel like

6813.599 --> 6816.8
simon dan

6814.719 --> 6818.0
that you've got to lay your claim at my

6816.8 --> 6821.4400000000005
door it's

6818.0 --> 6824.159
not my coriolis claim idiot

6821.44 --> 6825.36
it's the globe's claim things turn

6824.159 --> 6828.799999999999
underneath

6825.36 --> 6832.48
stuff not attached at 15 degrees an hour

6828.8 --> 6834.08
your climb idiot

6832.48 --> 6836.159
well can you at least get our claim

6834.08 --> 6839.119
right what is your claim

6836.159 --> 6840.48
maybe you can define coriolis like i was

6839.119 --> 6843.119
challenged to

6840.48 --> 6844.08
given it's your claim yeah seem

6843.119 --> 6846.08
unreasonable

6844.08 --> 6848.96
you're telling me i've got your claim

6846.08 --> 6851.44
wrong yet maybe you could clarify

6848.96 --> 6853.28
your claim of a globe earth turning

6851.44 --> 6855.759999999999
underneath at 15 degrees an hour

6853.28 --> 6857.679
for stuff to deflect that's move apart

6855.76 --> 6859.4400000000005
maybe you could define it as it's your

6857.679 --> 6861.679
claim

6859.44 --> 6862.879999999999
no nathan you've been talking about it

6861.679 --> 6865.04
for like an hour

6862.88 --> 6866.96
yeah debunking it earth isn't turning

6865.04 --> 6867.36
underneath anything at 15 degrees an

6866.96 --> 6869.28
hour

6867.36 --> 6871.119
we asked you about your claim of a

6869.28 --> 6871.92
caught pendulum and you said you weren't

6871.119 --> 6873.28
interested

6871.92 --> 6875.679
but you're very interested in me

6873.28 --> 6878.5599999999995
defining your claim

6875.679 --> 6880.0
can't stop muting discord i'm not muting

6878.56 --> 6882.2390000000005
anything you stupid dick

6880.0 --> 6884.32
i'm telling you that you're asking me to

6882.239 --> 6887.199
define something you claim

6884.32 --> 6888.239
it fails your claim of coriolis on a

6887.199 --> 6891.119
turning earth

6888.239 --> 6892.159
your claim fails i debunk it by pointing

6891.119 --> 6896.5599999999995
out the earth

6892.159 --> 6900.719
isn't turning underneath anything as per

6896.56 --> 6900.719
your claim of coriolis

6901.84 --> 6907.119000000001
demonstrate you know what you're talking

6903.679 --> 6909.1990000000005
about sunscreen for my audience

6907.119 --> 6910.5599999999995
yeah it's your claim i need to know what

6909.199 --> 6912.159
i'm talking about with your claim of

6910.56 --> 6914.719
coriolis do i

6912.159 --> 6915.44
we're not watching your show do you

6914.719 --> 6917.599
understand

6915.44 --> 6918.719
the part of it you thick [ __ ] read it

6917.599 --> 6921.28
for us

6918.719 --> 6922.719
suck my balls go to wikipedia read it

6921.28 --> 6924.4
yourself

6922.719 --> 6927.76
it's been doing this for over half a

6924.4 --> 6927.759999999999
year on a daily basis

6929.119 --> 6932.239
i don't need to know how this claim

6931.119 --> 6936.0
works ed

6932.239 --> 6938.0
it's your claim so if you want to labor

6936.0 --> 6941.76
how i've got it wrong

6938.0 --> 6944.0
your claim that you're making feel free

6941.76 --> 6944.8
but don't demand that i now justify the

6944.0 --> 6947.44
definition of

6944.8 --> 6948.2390000000005
your claim you say i'm debunking

6947.44 --> 6949.759999999999
incorrectly

6948.239 --> 6951.598999999999
because i'm certainly not claiming it

6949.76 --> 6953.92
mate you are

6951.599 --> 6955.28
what you're talking about you know how

6953.92 --> 6958.2390000000005
stupid you all sound by

6955.28 --> 6960.96
asking us to define your claim for you

6958.239 --> 6960.959999999999
why does you just

6970.159 --> 6975.28
it's not my claim i don't need to claim

6972.32 --> 6977.84
it or justify how it works

6975.28 --> 6978.88
when i'm not claiming it works on a

6977.84 --> 6981.4400000000005
turning earth

6978.88 --> 6982.56
you are why are you so scared to read

6981.44 --> 6983.919999999999
the definition

6982.56 --> 6986.2390000000005
why are you not scared of anything you

6983.92 --> 6988.32
stupid idiot come on

6986.239 --> 6990.638999999999
sorry i'll keep pointing out that it's

6988.32 --> 6992.719
your claim you need to be defining it

6990.639 --> 6994.719
you need to be justifying it you need to

6992.719 --> 6996.32
be giving us an example of it happening

6994.719 --> 6998.32
and you're challenging me to do it like

6996.32 --> 7000.32
it's my claim and it isn't

6998.32 --> 7002.0
the definition of coriolis come on suck

7000.32 --> 7004.0
my nuts come here and suck

7002.0 --> 7005.44
on them because i say so like you're

7004.0 --> 7007.04
telling me to read something

7005.44 --> 7008.799999999999
that's your claim that you should be

7007.04 --> 7012.0
making you should be divining

7008.8 --> 7013.4400000000005
and you should be showing happening bro

7012.0 --> 7017.84
are you gonna demonstrate you know what

7013.44 --> 7017.839999999999
your tactic is so dead

7028.239 --> 7031.119
one is observed

7038.48 --> 7042.5599999999995
yeah i was literally just then and you

7040.32 --> 7043.759999999999
carried on talking fundy muting me

7042.56 --> 7045.1990000000005
so i'm not going to now because you

7043.76 --> 7047.599
can't help yourself you just want to

7045.199 --> 7047.598999999999
interrupt

7047.74 --> 7051.599
[Music]

7049.119 --> 7051.598999999999
right

7052.88 --> 7061.679
you have a disability

7058.4 --> 7063.839999999999
yeah an abject [ __ ]

7061.679 --> 7067.04
it's in discord there's about four

7063.84 --> 7070.639
definitions in wristbands horribly

7067.04 --> 7073.04
it's a scary [ __ ] all of them

7070.639 --> 7073.04
could you

7099.76 --> 7107.1990000000005
topics qe

7103.119 --> 7107.5199999999995
your sister you have no idea what you're

7107.199 --> 7109.119
doing

7107.52 --> 7112.159000000001
you've not once acknowledged what i've

7109.119 --> 7113.759999999999
said your claim you should be declining

7112.159 --> 7115.199
you're still ignoring me ed it's your

7113.76 --> 7117.119000000001
claim that you should be defining for

7115.199 --> 7118.08
your claim earth spins underneath at 15

7117.119 --> 7121.04
degrees an hour

7118.08 --> 7123.679
no you're talking about it for like an

7121.04 --> 7123.679
hour come on

7123.92 --> 7127.84
debunking your claim it's debunking

7126.239 --> 7130.4
you're just ignoring me

7127.84 --> 7132.400000000001
debunk yeah just funny muting me right

7130.4 --> 7133.679
bundy mooting me bundy mute constantly

7132.4 --> 7136.879999999999
right ed

7133.679 --> 7139.04
no what i'm doing ed is uh uh-huh so

7136.88 --> 7140.32
continual funding muting what a coward

7139.04 --> 7141.84
it's because you've lost ed it's because

7140.32 --> 7143.92
you can't address my question

7141.84 --> 7145.92
yeah i'm deep there he goes again i'm

7143.92 --> 7147.679
not getting a chance am i ed you just

7145.92 --> 7149.84
funny muted me the whole time

7147.679 --> 7150.8
so ed what i'm doing isn't claiming

7149.84 --> 7153.04
coriolis

7150.8 --> 7154.08
that would be you that's claiming

7153.04 --> 7156.159
coriolis yes

7154.08 --> 7158.159
i'm deep there he goes again fundy mute

7156.159 --> 7160.96
coward let's try again

7158.159 --> 7162.4
so i'll try once more i'm not claiming

7160.96 --> 7164.08
there he goes again he can't contain

7162.4 --> 7164.96
himself because he knows he's lost what

7164.08 --> 7171.84
a coward

7164.96 --> 7171.84
fundy muting me constantly right

7174.239 --> 7176.879999999999
so i've explained and you've not

7175.52 --> 7177.599
addressed it i'll try once more if you

7176.88 --> 7180.2390000000005
interrupt again

7177.599 --> 7182.400000000001
you're gone immediately i'm not claiming

7180.239 --> 7183.36
coriolis

7182.4 --> 7185.598999999999
you're interrupting me with your

7183.36 --> 7187.28
laughter now

7185.599 --> 7188.96
take him out yeah i'm going to kick him

7187.28 --> 7191.199
out demonic cackling

7188.96 --> 7192.639
dad just let him speak and he won't he's

7191.199 --> 7194.239
funny

7192.639 --> 7195.679
now he can't help it he's gotta funding

7194.239 --> 7197.759999999999
mute me because he knows that

7195.679 --> 7199.84
my addressing him with this when he's

7197.76 --> 7201.599
funded muted every word of it to now

7199.84 --> 7203.28
will be devastating should he listen to

7201.599 --> 7206.96
it so ed

7203.28 --> 7208.159
i'm not claiming coriolis it's a globe

7206.96 --> 7210.4800000000005
claim

7208.159 --> 7212.719
you're claiming earth turns underneath

7210.48 --> 7214.718999999999
to give 15 degrees an hour deflection

7212.719 --> 7215.92
as you observe things not attached

7214.719 --> 7217.84
drifting away from you

7215.92 --> 7219.599
on a turning earth that's coriolis

7217.84 --> 7222.56
effect detailed

7219.599 --> 7223.92
for you as requested right now now

7222.56 --> 7227.599
that's not my claim

7223.92 --> 7229.599
i debunk it by pointing out nothing

7227.599 --> 7231.84
is being observed to drift away at 15

7229.599 --> 7232.639
degrees an hour as we turn underneath as

7231.84 --> 7235.84
is the claim

7232.639 --> 7239.1990000000005
on a globe that spins made by you and

7235.84 --> 7241.4400000000005
your fundy belief so please can you stop

7239.199 --> 7242.879999999999
asking me to justify something i don't

7241.44 --> 7246.5599999999995
claim when i've now

7242.88 --> 7255.119
done it to debunk your claim

7246.56 --> 7259.84
that doesn't happen on earth okay

7255.119 --> 7259.839999999999
what you got now you may speak

7260.96 --> 7264.56
why is he unmuted somebody mute him

7267.119 --> 7271.839999999999
did you put yourself on server mute so

7268.88 --> 7271.84
you didn't have to listen to it

7272.92 --> 7277.679
[Music]

7275.36 --> 7279.44
i didn't meet you so someone muted him

7277.679 --> 7280.56
and when they did you presumably put

7279.44 --> 7282.48
your fingers in the ear so you didn't

7280.56 --> 7283.1990000000005
have to listen right why did someone

7282.48 --> 7286.718999999999
mute him

7283.199 --> 7287.919999999999
no i was deafened and muted i didn't do

7286.719 --> 7291.119
anything

7287.92 --> 7291.119
okay do you want to listen again

7292.48 --> 7296.48
of course that's why i'm here but okay

7294.88 --> 7299.4400000000005
excellent

7296.48 --> 7299.919999999999
please don't mute him in discord so ed

7299.44 --> 7302.96
i'm

7299.92 --> 7305.599
not claiming coriolis effect

7302.96 --> 7306.2390000000005
that would be 15 degrees an hour turn of

7305.599 --> 7308.56
the earth

7306.239 --> 7311.119
underneath things not attached that's a

7308.56 --> 7315.04
globe earth claim

7311.119 --> 7318.08
and i'm debunking it by pointing out

7315.04 --> 7319.36
earth isn't turning under things that

7318.08 --> 7321.44
aren't attached

7319.36 --> 7323.5199999999995
to demonstrate 15 degrees an hour of

7321.44 --> 7326.32
drift so can you please stop

7323.52 --> 7327.4400000000005
asking me to define something i'm not

7326.32 --> 7331.119
claiming

7327.44 --> 7331.119
you are thank you

7332.08 --> 7336.96
no you claim a lot of things about

7334.88 --> 7337.92
coriolis so what's the definition of

7336.96 --> 7341.28
choreography okay

7337.92 --> 7342.08
what do i claim what do i claim what do

7341.28 --> 7346.48
i claim

7342.08 --> 7348.239
please new docs for like one and a half

7346.48 --> 7350.48
hour about yeah i know he said

7348.239 --> 7352.959999999999
he said you said you also said i claimed

7350.48 --> 7352.959999999999
a lot of stuff

7365.04 --> 7368.88
well i've been asking you the definition

7367.04 --> 7371.5199999999995
of coriolis for like what have i

7368.88 --> 7373.52
claimed ed not what you've asked me are

7371.52 --> 7374.400000000001
you stupid i'm not asking you what you

7373.52 --> 7377.119000000001
asked me

7374.4 --> 7378.799999999999
you said i claim a lot about it name one

7377.119 --> 7381.36
thing i've claimed

7378.8 --> 7382.08
my question i know yeah you're dodging i

7381.36 --> 7384.96
know that yeah

7382.08 --> 7386.88
so what's the definition of sorry ed

7384.96 --> 7388.719
i've already defined it for him

7386.88 --> 7390.400000000001
sorry guys can you stop interrupting he

7388.719 --> 7392.719
stopped interrupting please

7390.4 --> 7394.0
yeah i just did ed i explained that i'd

7392.719 --> 7397.76
not only defined it for

7394.0 --> 7397.76
you that you acknowledged it

7398.32 --> 7401.759999999999
no i didn't yeah i've done it three

7400.639 --> 7404.08
times ed

7401.76 --> 7405.1990000000005
ed you stuck record even after it's been

7404.08 --> 7406.88
defined

7405.199 --> 7408.879999999999
now you're talking through me and disc

7406.88 --> 7412.32
and g plus is interrupting you

7408.88 --> 7414.0
ground noise of course yeah yeah okay ed

7412.32 --> 7415.199
you'd not acknowledge what i said you've

7414.0 --> 7415.76
just gone back to the question i've

7415.199 --> 7418.239
already

7415.76 --> 7418.96
answered by defining it it's on screen i

7418.239 --> 7421.759999999999
defined it

7418.96 --> 7422.96
no but you didn't define anything oh so

7421.76 --> 7424.2390000000005
you're just going to keep asking me to

7422.96 --> 7425.92
define it after i've done it

7424.239 --> 7428.32
ignoring my question yeah now you can

7425.92 --> 7428.32
get out

7428.4 --> 7432.799999999999
yeah so basically ignore all assertions

7431.92 --> 7434.8
from me

7432.8 --> 7436.079000000001
oh yes sir i'm not claiming anything he

7434.8 --> 7438.56
says you've claimed a lot

7436.079 --> 7440.0
what have i claimed define coriolis

7438.56 --> 7442.88
that's how it goes with ed because he's

7440.0 --> 7442.88
a complete wanker

7443.84 --> 7449.360000000001
and then that's right we'll find it so

7447.679 --> 7451.04
you would think that after you defined

7449.36 --> 7454.0
it he understood the definition

7451.04 --> 7455.599
and then wanted to go into what you

7454.0 --> 7457.92
claimed about it but he can't even

7455.599 --> 7458.639
say one claim that you mentioned about

7457.92 --> 7462.2390000000005
coriolis

7458.639 --> 7464.0
yeah because i don't it's another geo

7462.239 --> 7467.678999999999
video that anthony showed

7464.0 --> 7470.8
earlier that shows coriolis

7467.679 --> 7472.4800000000005
the coriolis effect is it saying that's

7470.8 --> 7474.88
incorrect as well

7472.48 --> 7479.839999999999
coriolis is a real thing demonstratable

7474.88 --> 7479.84
but of earth it does not exist

7481.199 --> 7484.239
that has joined the ranks of the

7482.88 --> 7488.8
geometric horizon

7484.239 --> 7488.799999999999
in being considered as a straw man

7490.8 --> 7494.719
due to the earth spinning that's the

7492.719 --> 7496.4800000000005
coriolis effect that doesn't take place

7494.719 --> 7497.84
there is coriolis effect whenever

7496.48 --> 7501.28
something is moving

7497.84 --> 7501.28
in relation to something else

7502.159 --> 7506.079
yeah armin's right coriolis effect is

7504.079 --> 7507.679
real you can observe it as the oh no the

7506.079 --> 7508.88
trees coming towards me because i'm

7507.679 --> 7510.96
spinning on a roundabout

7508.88 --> 7512.639
that's coriolis effect it's real they

7510.96 --> 7514.719
claim that happens on earth

7512.639 --> 7515.76
that would be oh look at that plane it's

7514.719 --> 7517.199
curving

7515.76 --> 7518.8
oh it's not really curving it's me

7517.199 --> 7520.719
turning underneath it

7518.8 --> 7522.400000000001
now that doesn't happen they claim it

7520.719 --> 7523.679
happens coriolis is real it just doesn't

7522.4 --> 7526.239
happen on spinning earth

7523.679 --> 7527.84
what's that you say ed define coriolis

7526.239 --> 7528.638999999999
what the thing you claim happens and we

7527.84 --> 7531.679
debunk

7528.639 --> 7533.4400000000005
no no need mate oh okay i'll define it

7531.679 --> 7535.119
then i'll read it out off the screen

7533.44 --> 7536.879999999999
what's that you say define it when i ask

7535.119 --> 7538.079
you why you're asking me to define it

7536.88 --> 7542.159000000001
when it's your claim

7538.079 --> 7542.159
yeah great tactics lads great tactics

7542.32 --> 7546.32
you know why he's calling it a straw man

7544.639 --> 7549.04
because it doesn't happen

7546.32 --> 7549.84
yeah saying earth turns underneath is a

7549.04 --> 7552.96
straw man

7549.84 --> 7556.719
yeah we know it doesn't turn yeah

7552.96 --> 7558.88
no problem keep debunking that no no

7556.719 --> 7563.76
problem keep keep coming and doing that

7558.88 --> 7567.04
thank you

7563.76 --> 7568.4800000000005
go ahead yeah nathan wasn't ed the guy

7567.04 --> 7570.48
talking about the sun

7568.48 --> 7571.598999999999
shining underneath the clouds a while

7570.48 --> 7574.959999999999
back ago

7571.599 --> 7576.0
yes he did and he's still coming back

7574.96 --> 7578.32
because he can't figure it

7576.0 --> 7579.679
out that's right he didn't realize he's

7578.32 --> 7581.599
making a coriolis claim

7579.679 --> 7582.8
that was him actually making a claim

7581.599 --> 7584.2390000000005
what do you know within

7582.8 --> 7586.96
a couple of minutes of me being

7584.239 --> 7588.959999999999
challenged on my claims about coriolis

7586.96 --> 7590.2390000000005
just out of the blue we can name one

7588.96 --> 7592.0
that ed's made

7590.239 --> 7594.159
he claimed earth turned underneath the

7592.0 --> 7596.0
sun that would be coriolis deflection as

7594.159 --> 7596.48
earth turns underneath of 15 degrees an

7596.0 --> 7597.84
hour

7596.48 --> 7600.0
well what do you know i should be

7597.84 --> 7604.96
defining that really shouldn't i

7600.0 --> 7608.56
given that he's claimed it

7604.96 --> 7609.36
both ed and voice are both claiming not

7608.56 --> 7611.119000000001
just that

7609.36 --> 7612.719
they're not just claiming that nathan is

7611.119 --> 7614.159
claiming coriolis

7612.719 --> 7615.92
they're claiming that also he's

7614.159 --> 7618.4
incorrect about coriolis

7615.92 --> 7619.52
even though nathan's actual explanation

7618.4 --> 7623.119
of coriolis

7619.52 --> 7626.079000000001
matches national geographic

7623.119 --> 7627.679
so they're basically saying both nathan

7626.079 --> 7630.639
and national geographic

7627.679 --> 7632.2390000000005
are incorrect and also nathan as claim

7630.639 --> 7635.76
and corey waters effect

7632.239 --> 7637.44
for a stationary flutter

7635.76 --> 7639.92
and they're debunking uh smoking the

7637.44 --> 7643.44
grass tyson

7639.92 --> 7644.639
so they've all fallen they've all fallen

7643.44 --> 7647.28
into the same stupid

7644.639 --> 7648.32
trap as dan and fight the flat earth

7647.28 --> 7650.0
which is to think that

7648.32 --> 7651.92
somehow i'm making a claim about

7650.0 --> 7654.32
coriolis effect when i detail it

7651.92 --> 7655.92
oh well then he must be claiming it he's

7654.32 --> 7657.92
claiming earth turns underneath well

7655.92 --> 7659.28
that's just absurd i'm gonna debunk that

7657.92 --> 7660.719
nathan claims earth should turn

7659.28 --> 7662.719
underneath

7660.719 --> 7664.32
oh right you want to debunk that i claim

7662.719 --> 7665.92
that yeah i don't claim that

7664.32 --> 7668.48
you claim that you complete bunch of

7665.92 --> 7668.4800000000005
morons

7672.239 --> 7676.239
and if you're not subscribed subscribe

7673.679 --> 7681.28
now to nathan oakley

7676.239 --> 7684.48
become a nathan yeah ballers down to a

7681.28 --> 7686.639
pathetic level ballers coming in here

7684.48 --> 7689.119
and calling your own claim straw man

7686.639 --> 7691.119
when all we're doing is defining what

7689.119 --> 7694.48
your claim is

7691.119 --> 7694.48
you know how ridiculous that is

7696.8 --> 7700.2390000000005
we even demonstrate to them their own

7698.4 --> 7703.04
claims and they still don't get it

7700.239 --> 7704.879999999999
yeah have you noticed as well that they

7703.04 --> 7706.48
the main protagonists on their side

7704.88 --> 7708.96
refuse to engage in like

7706.48 --> 7709.919999999999
comments other than to insult or

7708.96 --> 7711.199
ridicule

7709.92 --> 7712.719
because they know that if they try

7711.199 --> 7714.239
staying on topic because they're forced

7712.719 --> 7715.52
to stay on topic they know that they're

7714.239 --> 7717.04
going to get cornered and they can't

7715.52 --> 7718.8
answer certain questions

7717.04 --> 7721.04
so they don't engage so what they're

7718.8 --> 7722.4800000000005
doing is they're sending cannon fodder

7721.04 --> 7724.239
instead to take one for the team

7722.48 --> 7726.4
and that's what's happening right now

7724.239 --> 7728.079
exactly that's what that is the

7726.4 --> 7730.48
sacrificial lamb

7728.079 --> 7732.639
who either has been sent in or comes in

7730.48 --> 7736.32
on his own volition to die at the

7732.639 --> 7739.1990000000005
the altar of his globe

7736.32 --> 7744.239
in a terrible pathetic way it's more

7739.199 --> 7745.919999999999
like the sacrificial lane

7744.239 --> 7747.36
like me and always realizing that we're

7745.92 --> 7748.639
wrong on summit right and we say

7747.36 --> 7750.239
chocolate go in there for us and get

7748.639 --> 7751.92
battered for us so that we don't have to

7750.239 --> 7753.28
indigo chocolate see you later me and i

7751.92 --> 7759.84
went like

7753.28 --> 7759.84
sorry chocolate

7761.36 --> 7766.0
he thinks he's like a saint of the globe

7765.119 --> 7768.4
or something

7766.0 --> 7769.36
because against all odds even against

7768.4 --> 7771.92
the very

7769.36 --> 7772.48
deceiving foundations of logic itself

7771.92 --> 7775.84
he's

7772.48 --> 7781.28
going forward so any globalism

7775.84 --> 7787.84
or got head back he's a numpty

7781.28 --> 7787.84
maybe akumakumari

7792.32 --> 7795.44
i'm hoping xanax would bring his

7793.679 --> 7798.159
so-called scientific hypothesis for

7795.44 --> 7798.159
coriolis

7798.84 --> 7804.0
sanic

7801.84 --> 7805.360000000001
at least anna can give a better try at

7804.0 --> 7808.719
an argument than

7805.36 --> 7813.04
just clown head it's mostly that he just

7808.719 --> 7813.04
has to [ __ ] defend xanax but damn it

7821.04 --> 7824.719
yeah can you explain the thing you've

7822.639 --> 7826.8
explained over ten thousand times in the

7824.719 --> 7829.04
last i've been listening to you for hour

7826.8 --> 7834.400000000001
what did i say name one thing i said

7829.04 --> 7834.4
i don't know you were clown man

7834.56 --> 7838.88
it's great comedy keep going bullish

7840.079 --> 7847.28
where's jakey i don't know

7845.04 --> 7848.639
maybe this time he sank so far into the

7847.28 --> 7852.639
swamp he couldn't

7848.639 --> 7852.639
get out of it again in discord

7854.48 --> 7857.5199999999995
maybe he's become so slow in his talking

7857.119 --> 7859.598999999999
that

7857.52 --> 7861.52
he's no longer like on our frequency

7859.599 --> 7862.0
it's like trying to talk to ants now

7861.52 --> 7865.1990000000005
maybe

7862.0 --> 7868.159
with jackie he's on the server

7865.199 --> 7870.799999999999
he's going do you want to know how

7868.159 --> 7870.799999999999
chucky proved

7870.88 --> 7876.719
oh brother we don't want to hear chicky

7874.079 --> 7879.36
let's ask him if the focal pendulum does

7876.719 --> 7882.84
figure eights

7879.36 --> 7885.839999999999
does earth turn underneath the pendulum

7882.84 --> 7885.84
charkie

7891.52 --> 7900.88
does earth turn under the pendulum

7898.32 --> 7901.759999999999
god i just want to just want to point

7900.88 --> 7904.96
out this is

7901.76 --> 7908.2390000000005
this is claimed to be the the

7904.96 --> 7910.079
the proof earth spins and we're asking

7908.239 --> 7912.879999999999
the globe is on the panel

7910.079 --> 7914.0
do you accept this claimed proof the

7912.88 --> 7916.719
earth is spinning

7914.0 --> 7917.599
in the form of earth turning under a

7916.719 --> 7922.159
pendulum

7917.599 --> 7922.159000000001
and nobody's prepared to say yes

7923.84 --> 7929.04
best tactic is for them not to engage

7925.76 --> 7929.04
because they got to lose an argument

7932.96 --> 7936.8
dire times when no one's prepared to say

7934.88 --> 7939.4400000000005
yes when a flat earther asks

7936.8 --> 7941.28
does the cult prove earth spins because

7939.44 --> 7944.0
earth's turning underneath the 15

7941.28 --> 7946.8
degrees an hour what about the gyro

7944.0 --> 7949.04
ballers does earth turn underneath the

7946.8 --> 7950.56
gyroscope at 15 degrees an hour i get a

7949.04 --> 7952.719
lot of comments about this

7950.56 --> 7954.8
surely one of you will put your stamp on

7952.719 --> 7959.119
it and claim bob proved it

7954.8 --> 7960.96
right lads nah i think that the globers

7959.119 --> 7961.759999999999
just need to really get together and

7960.96 --> 7969.84
think about

7961.76 --> 7969.84
a way how to get our trust back

7970.639 --> 7973.679
they won't answer the other ones would

7972.0 --> 7976.079
be

7973.679 --> 7978.2390000000005
what was it that bob proved was drifting

7976.079 --> 7980.32
away from wash

7978.239 --> 7982.32
because they keep on saying bob proved

7980.32 --> 7984.719
to 15 over an hour drift

7982.32 --> 7986.719
so what was drifting away from what then

7984.719 --> 7988.96
15 degrees

7986.719 --> 7991.04
exactly i like to add on to the end of

7988.96 --> 7994.32
their comment oh of earth turning

7991.04 --> 7994.8
underneath the gyroscope so earth's

7994.32 --> 7997.119
turning

7994.8 --> 7999.84
underneath then now you and your

7997.119 --> 8002.32
reference frames have been ruined

7999.84 --> 8004.079
there is no drift check out this man on

8002.32 --> 8007.199
a trampoline not drifting

8004.079 --> 8009.759999999999
that's what earth does no drift

8007.199 --> 8010.879999999999
no 15 degrees an hour maybe that's a

8009.76 --> 8014.56
claim i'm making

8010.88 --> 8014.56
maybe i should define coriolis

8017.199 --> 8020.799999999999
ah comparison you know what the folk

8019.44 --> 8023.598999999999
called pendulum

8020.8 --> 8026.8
does you're being called out he said he

8023.599 --> 8026.8
hates it when he gets called out

8029.36 --> 8033.598999999999
when he gets called out back empire hey

8031.36 --> 8035.839999999999
lord please i'm sorry go ahead

8033.599 --> 8036.96
every time you say my name is funny

8035.84 --> 8039.28
what's up man folk

8036.96 --> 8042.079
pendulum does it what what happens does

8039.28 --> 8042.079
it do figure eight

8042.48 --> 8046.159
nice i don't know i don't know what it

8043.84 --> 8047.76
does it just swings back and forth

8046.159 --> 8050.159
but if it just swings back and forth

8047.76 --> 8054.0
then you know what it does

8050.159 --> 8057.759999999999
i'm not not a big person on pendulums

8054.0 --> 8060.239
guys asking a kumu virus on what is real

8057.76 --> 8061.1990000000005
in what model is like asking a mental

8060.239 --> 8063.839999999999
patient

8061.199 --> 8066.719
but he just answered it like he what

8063.84 --> 8068.4800000000005
does a pendulum do yeah but he's gone

8066.719 --> 8070.2390000000005
he figures out he's not supposed to say

8068.48 --> 8073.5199999999995
that according to the model

8070.239 --> 8073.5199999999995
let him figure that out later

8076.32 --> 8082.719
come on virus

8079.599 --> 8086.2390000000005
is the uh is the earth rotating

8082.719 --> 8086.2390000000005
underneath the pendulum

8087.36 --> 8091.839999999999
yeah well then yeah then flight times

8090.239 --> 8093.28
would be reduced when you traveled west

8091.84 --> 8095.4400000000005
and balls would fly out of your hand at

8093.28 --> 8097.44
1000 miles an hour on the equator

8095.44 --> 8099.119
you'd launch a balloon and they would

8097.44 --> 8100.159
land in a different country

8099.119 --> 8101.598999999999
because earth would be turning

8100.159 --> 8103.199
underneath those things now wouldn't it

8101.599 --> 8104.8
virus if the pendulum was right and

8103.199 --> 8105.5199999999995
earth was turning underneath it at 15

8104.8 --> 8107.679
degrees an hour

8105.52 --> 8109.84
that would mean we have drift and we

8107.679 --> 8109.84
don't

8110.159 --> 8113.679
why don't you explain the coriolis on

8111.92 --> 8115.599
the equator again

8113.679 --> 8116.719
i don't claim coriolis on the equator

8115.599 --> 8118.96
virus you do

8116.719 --> 8120.56
you you want me to claim your claim for

8118.96 --> 8123.76
you sorry virus

8120.56 --> 8124.719
sorry virus you want me to detail your

8123.76 --> 8126.719
claim

8124.719 --> 8127.76
of coriolis on the equator because i

8126.719 --> 8129.199
don't claim that mate

8127.76 --> 8130.4800000000005
i know you said it earlier he didn't

8129.199 --> 8131.04
seem to respond when i said it then

8130.48 --> 8133.919999999999
either

8131.04 --> 8136.239
it's not my claim it's yours so perhaps

8133.92 --> 8138.079
you could detail about it

8136.239 --> 8139.678999999999
yeah your claim about koryos on the

8138.079 --> 8140.639
equator maybe you could detail it if

8139.679 --> 8144.4
it's your claim

8140.639 --> 8146.079
which it is no no it's really not

8144.4 --> 8148.0
because i explained on the other show

8146.079 --> 8148.639
what my claim was about coriolis on the

8148.0 --> 8151.679
equator

8148.639 --> 8154.639
oh so you do claim coriolis so you

8151.679 --> 8156.96
do claim corey honestly define it right

8154.639 --> 8156.96
now

8158.4 --> 8161.5199999999995
what are you i'm not listening are you

8160.239 --> 8164.799999999999
deaf it does not

8161.52 --> 8164.8
you deaf wait you've just

8167.599 --> 8173.52
shut up you've just told me that you

8170.88 --> 8173.52
have a claim

8174.079 --> 8179.679
totally intolerable virus

8178.4 --> 8181.5199999999995
you're gonna just [ __ ] with your mic

8179.679 --> 8184.4800000000005
while i talk to you

8181.52 --> 8186.0
you've just told us you have a claim you

8184.48 --> 8187.598999999999
want me to detail

8186.0 --> 8189.599
that you made about coriolis on the

8187.599 --> 8190.56
equator so let's get it absolutely

8189.599 --> 8194.16
straight

8190.56 --> 8197.2
you do make a claim about coriolis then

8194.16 --> 8198.639
i don't you do you've just made that

8197.2 --> 8200.399000000001
explicitly clear

8198.639 --> 8202.16
so given that ed thought it was

8200.399 --> 8204.719
reasonable because he thought i made

8202.16 --> 8207.92
claims about coriolis effect i don't

8204.719 --> 8211.119999999999
you do shut up

8207.92 --> 8213.12
shut up you [ __ ] wanker what is your

8211.12 --> 8215.92
malfunction

8213.12 --> 8217.359
shut the [ __ ] up you stupid ignorant

8215.92 --> 8219.359
dick

8217.359 --> 8220.960000000001
so you've just made it clear you do

8219.359 --> 8222.800000000001
claim coriolis then

8220.96 --> 8225.598999999998
and you want me to parrot back your

8222.8 --> 8229.759999999998
claim that you make about coriolis

8225.599 --> 8232.399
so i don't you do i want you to define

8229.76 --> 8234.0
it like i was demanded to do by ed

8232.399 --> 8237.119999999999
given that we've firmly established you

8234.0 --> 8237.12
do [ __ ] claim it

8239.679 --> 8245.519
can i speak now you can define it

8242.88 --> 8248.96
like i was demanded to do define

8245.519 --> 8250.960000000001
coriolis right now

8248.96 --> 8253.438999999998
you know you made a claim about you

8250.96 --> 8258.559
claim coriolis on the equator

8253.439 --> 8259.84
we've just clarified that now define it

8258.559 --> 8262.0
how did you clarify something that i

8259.84 --> 8264.319
didn't say you claimed

8262.0 --> 8265.12
you have a claim of coriolis on the

8264.319 --> 8267.92
equator

8265.12 --> 8268.719000000001
you demanded i parrot it back correctly

8267.92 --> 8271.679
ergo

8268.719 --> 8273.518999999998
you absolutely have a claim that

8271.679 --> 8276.24
involves coriolis

8273.519 --> 8279.04
i'm demanding you define it given it's

8276.24 --> 8279.039999999999
your claim

8279.2 --> 8282.479000000001
i haven't i've made one claim about

8281.679 --> 8286.0
coriolis

8282.479 --> 8288.399
now define it you dumb [ __ ]

8286.0 --> 8290.0
we don't have it on the equator you well

8288.399 --> 8292.24
then you don't have any drift so no

8290.0 --> 8293.84
proof of earth turn you stupid idiot you

8292.24 --> 8296.559
don't have it on the equator

8293.84 --> 8297.359
so no drift no 15 degrees an hour

8296.559 --> 8300.399
deviation

8297.359 --> 8304.960000000001
so your claim of coriolis is to debunk

8300.399 --> 8306.96
we have it on earth

8304.96 --> 8309.119999999999
you've just debunked coriolis on earth

8306.96 --> 8312.0
virus you've just said we don't have it

8309.12 --> 8312.0
on the equator

8312.16 --> 8315.519
yeah it's pretty bad virus i don't know

8313.92 --> 8318.639
why you would even say that

8315.519 --> 8319.28
are you thick virus you make a claim

8318.639 --> 8321.119999999999
about

8319.28 --> 8323.359
not having this effect that's supposed

8321.12 --> 8325.519
to prove earth turns on the equator

8323.359 --> 8329.04
so you are quite literally debunking

8325.519 --> 8330.719000000001
earth-based coriolis then

8329.04 --> 8332.479000000001
not really i mean you just said it

8330.719 --> 8333.438999999998
doesn't happen on the equator you dumb

8332.479 --> 8335.84
[ __ ]

8333.439 --> 8336.479000000001
so it doesn't happen then oh what'd i

8335.84 --> 8337.76
say

8336.479 --> 8341.039999999999
yeah he said it doesn't happen on the

8337.76 --> 8341.04
equator you dumb [ __ ]

8341.679 --> 8344.719000000001
you think i don't know what i just said

8343.439 --> 8345.679
you said it doesn't happen on the

8344.719 --> 8348.399
equator

8345.679 --> 8350.0
so no coriolis drift at 15 degrees an

8348.399 --> 8354.639
hour according to you

8350.0 --> 8354.639
you're debunking earth turn virus

8354.719 --> 8358.319
are you are you really are you

8356.719 --> 8360.88
stuttering like a [ __ ]

8358.319 --> 8363.599
yeah you are you've just told me no

8360.88 --> 8367.358999999999
coriolis on the equator

8363.599 --> 8368.08
exactly so no drift then no proof earth

8367.359 --> 8370.559000000001
spins

8368.08 --> 8371.359
no 15 degrees in our deviation according

8370.559 --> 8376.319
to you

8371.359 --> 8378.800000000001
you've just debunked earth spinning

8376.319 --> 8380.08
yeah i think you got selective hearing

8378.8 --> 8384.08
are you deaf

8380.08 --> 8389.039999999999
you've just debunked a spinning virus

8384.08 --> 8389.039999999999
i think you're deal maybe you are

8400.319 --> 8404.24
that's what you have the global telling

8402.479 --> 8404.88
me i don't understand coriolis which i

8404.24 --> 8407.199999999999
don't claim

8404.88 --> 8408.88
has just done you've told me well i do

8407.2 --> 8410.399000000001
claim corios i've got a very specific

8408.88 --> 8412.8
claim about it on the equator

8410.399 --> 8414.72
it doesn't happen so you've debunked

8412.8 --> 8415.279999999999
earth turn well done virus you complete

8414.72 --> 8417.599999999999
idiot

8415.28 --> 8419.52
your debunking globe earth turn by way

8417.6 --> 8420.800000000001
of coriolis drift by saying there isn't

8419.52 --> 8423.2
any on the equator

8420.8 --> 8424.399
well done welcome to stationary earth

8423.2 --> 8426.240000000002
you complete [ __ ]

8424.399 --> 8428.16
you're debunking the globe earth claim

8426.24 --> 8430.16
that it spins with coriolis drift

8428.16 --> 8433.76
because according to you there isn't any

8430.16 --> 8433.76
at the equator right virus

8434.16 --> 8436.96
damn skippy

8437.68 --> 8441.04
welcome to flat earth brother welcome to

8439.6 --> 8442.720000000001
everything you're really just showing us

8441.04 --> 8443.6
you don't understand the globe claim of

8442.72 --> 8445.84
coriolis

8443.6 --> 8447.04
do you want to define it for us maybe

8445.84 --> 8449.28
you could define us

8447.04 --> 8450.960000000001
given it's your claim you make about the

8449.28 --> 8451.84
equator and what happens with regard to

8450.96 --> 8453.599999999999
coriolis

8451.84 --> 8455.92
maybe you could define it for us and

8453.6 --> 8457.52
explain how this claim of earth turning

8455.92 --> 8458.64
underneath to give us drift at 15

8457.52 --> 8461.6
degrees an hour

8458.64 --> 8463.199999999999
doesn't happen according to you maybe

8461.6 --> 8465.68
you could clarify that you complete

8463.2 --> 8467.04
idiot

8465.68 --> 8468.960000000001
no it just doesn't happen i'm not going

8467.04 --> 8469.76
to explain oh so no coriolis it just

8468.96 --> 8471.199999999999
doesn't happen

8469.76 --> 8473.04
we just don't see earth turning

8471.2 --> 8474.800000000001
underneath it just doesn't happen

8473.04 --> 8478.160000000002
so again for the second time you're

8474.8 --> 8478.16
debunking earth turn then

8478.8 --> 8481.679999999998
well i'm debunking the fact that you

8480.479 --> 8482.88
think you know you talking about

8481.68 --> 8486.0
coriolis

8482.88 --> 8488.72
i don't you do it's your claim for the

8486.0 --> 8490.479
fifth time you stupid idiot it doesn't

8488.72 --> 8493.679999999998
matter what i think about curios you're

8490.479 --> 8495.358999999999
claiming it doesn't happen

8493.68 --> 8497.04
i mean because you're debunking a straw

8495.359 --> 8498.56
man you're not debunking oh your straw

8497.04 --> 8500.880000000001
man that you say it doesn't happen

8498.56 --> 8503.359
doesn't need debunking you stupid idiot

8500.88 --> 8505.519999999999
you've told us it doesn't happen so what

8503.359 --> 8508.24
do i need to debunk now virus

8505.52 --> 8510.08
you've told us it doesn't happen mate so

8508.24 --> 8512.56
you've debunked it by yourself

8510.08 --> 8514.88
no need for any straw man on my part i

8512.56 --> 8517.92
don't make any claims about coriolis

8514.88 --> 8520.479
you do you claim it doesn't happen

8517.92 --> 8522.960000000001
so no debunking needed you've done it

8520.479 --> 8522.96
for us

8523.52 --> 8527.52
yeah did you not hear us welcome you to

8525.84 --> 8528.479
flat stationary earth that's not our

8527.52 --> 8531.76
emergency

8528.479 --> 8534.96
there's no drift at the equator so yeah

8531.76 --> 8535.76
we agree with that maybe you'd like to

8534.96 --> 8537.599999999999
know

8535.76 --> 8539.28
virus maybe you'd like to give us a

8537.6 --> 8540.640000000001
demonstration now of a man on a

8539.28 --> 8543.28
trampoline

8540.64 --> 8545.199999999999
not drifting as a really wonderful

8543.28 --> 8546.800000000001
example of how you don't have coriolis

8545.2 --> 8547.68
maybe show us someone not drifting on a

8546.8 --> 8549.199999999999
trampoline

8547.68 --> 8550.800000000001
and tell us all about how the reference

8549.2 --> 8553.76
frames are ruined and we don't have

8550.8 --> 8553.759999999998
coriolis drift

8554.399 --> 8558.24
yeah your reference range has been

8555.76 --> 8561.439
ruined so no drift there no coriolis

8558.24 --> 8563.039999999999
effect earth is not turning

8561.439 --> 8564.08
we still got our court we still got our

8563.04 --> 8566.960000000001
choreographers and we still got our

8564.08 --> 8568.96
reference frames yours has been going

8566.96 --> 8570.0
but you're a thicko you're telling me

8568.96 --> 8571.599999999999
about how you don't have

8570.0 --> 8573.04
two reference frames no drift on the

8571.6 --> 8574.56
equator but still want to claim that

8573.04 --> 8577.12
you've got two reference frames

8574.56 --> 8578.88
so what's drifting apart then virus

8577.12 --> 8582.319000000001
what's drifting away at 15 degrees an

8578.88 --> 8583.679999999998
hour if you do have two reference frames

8582.319 --> 8585.119999999999
yeah i don't understand what you're

8583.68 --> 8586.64
talking about what you say yeah so you

8585.12 --> 8588.08
don't understand koryos while you're

8586.64 --> 8588.64
asking me to define it when i don't

8588.08 --> 8589.92
claim it

8588.64 --> 8591.92
you're claiming it and haven't got the

8589.92 --> 8593.6
vagus clue what it even is

8591.92 --> 8595.2
so i'll ask again given you don't know

8593.6 --> 8599.439
what this is what's

8595.2 --> 8602.319000000001
drifting at 15 degrees an hour virus

8599.439 --> 8602.960000000001
two references it's your claim you

8602.319 --> 8605.359
stupid

8602.96 --> 8606.399
[ __ ] how many times have you funded he's

8605.359 --> 8610.0
gonna ask me

8606.399 --> 8612.64
to give you your claim no mate

8610.0 --> 8613.52
you claim earth turns underneath the 15

8612.64 --> 8616.16
degrees an hour

8613.52 --> 8618.16
and stuff drifts apart i'm asking you to

8616.16 --> 8620.319
tell me exactly what drifts

8618.16 --> 8621.6
at 15 degrees an hour and you're asking

8620.319 --> 8625.439
me to do it for you

8621.6 --> 8627.12
it's not my claim how many times oh no

8625.439 --> 8628.960000000001
you don't know yeah we know you don't

8627.12 --> 8629.439
know none of you thickos on the globe

8628.96 --> 8631.519999999999
side

8629.439 --> 8632.960000000001
even understand what coriolis is but

8631.52 --> 8634.0
you're more than happy to ask me to

8632.96 --> 8637.358999999999
define it

8634.0 --> 8639.439
when you claim it we don't understand

8637.359 --> 8641.52
your version of coriolis not my version

8639.439 --> 8643.76
i'm not claiming it how many times

8641.52 --> 8644.560000000001
do you complete idiots need me to tell

8643.76 --> 8648.0
you

8644.56 --> 8648.0
it's your claim

8648.16 --> 8652.0
you probably have to tell us as many

8650.319 --> 8652.88
times as we have to tell you that that's

8652.0 --> 8655.84
not our claim

8652.88 --> 8655.839999999998
what is your claim

8657.439 --> 8662.800000000001
what is it dumb [ __ ] so

8660.8 --> 8664.479
i've got your claim wrong so we're

8662.8 --> 8665.438999999998
finally in agreement it's your [ __ ]

8664.479 --> 8670.64
claim then

8665.439 --> 8670.64
maybe you'd like to clarify your claim

8672.479 --> 8677.358999999999
no maybe you'd like to chuckle while i

8674.88 --> 8680.479
rape you

8677.359 --> 8682.880000000001
what yeah i'm absolutely annihilating

8680.479 --> 8684.319
you stupid [ __ ] you don't even know what

8682.88 --> 8686.72
coriolis is

8684.319 --> 8688.479
yet you're simultaneously telling us it

8686.72 --> 8690.88
doesn't happen on the equator

8688.479 --> 8692.319
but you have got two reference frames i

8690.88 --> 8693.839999999998
ask you what's drifting

8692.319 --> 8697.199999999999
and you haven't got a [ __ ] clue what

8693.84 --> 8698.64
i'm even talking about

8697.2 --> 8700.240000000002
if you asking me what's drifting you

8698.64 --> 8701.439
didn't give me an object or anything i

8700.24 --> 8703.439
don't

8701.439 --> 8705.28
yeah with earth turning underneath at 15

8703.439 --> 8706.399
degrees now what's drifting away from us

8705.28 --> 8707.52
there you go you've got the reference

8706.399 --> 8710.0
frames and the object

8707.52 --> 8713.439
anything not attached what's drifting at

8710.0 --> 8713.439
15 degrees now virus

8714.399 --> 8718.08
i i don't understand what you're saying

8716.319 --> 8718.56
when you say yeah it's your [ __ ]

8718.08 --> 8721.039999999999
claim

8718.56 --> 8722.8
we know you don't know what i'm saying

8721.04 --> 8724.800000000001
you think i've got it wrong

8722.8 --> 8726.319
when in reality you don't know what

8724.8 --> 8727.92
you're even claiming

8726.319 --> 8730.08
so because you don't know what you're

8727.92 --> 8732.479
claiming you think you need to make it

8730.08 --> 8735.6
into a claim i'm making

8732.479 --> 8738.8
no you don't understand

8735.6 --> 8742.16
your own claim you don't even appreciate

8738.8 --> 8742.16
it's a claim you're making

8743.28 --> 8747.76
you laugh it up you dumb [ __ ] you're

8745.84 --> 8748.64
asking me to define it and justify and

8747.76 --> 8750.479
explain it

8748.64 --> 8752.72
and it's your claim that you don't

8750.479 --> 8755.519999999999
understand i ask you what's drifting and

8752.72 --> 8755.519999999999
you haven't got a clue

8755.6 --> 8758.960000000001
yeah i don't understand i know you don't

8757.52 --> 8760.479000000001
understand you're thick

8758.96 --> 8762.24
yet you're here to tell us all about how

8760.479 --> 8763.599999999999
you understand pendulums and drift

8762.24 --> 8765.76
and tell us we've got two reference

8763.6 --> 8766.16
frames you have no idea what you're

8765.76 --> 8769.2
talking

8766.16 --> 8771.68
about do you yeah

8769.2 --> 8773.12
i know so what's drifting okay we've got

8771.68 --> 8773.92
two reference frames okay you know what

8773.12 --> 8776.160000000002
you're talking about yeah

8773.92 --> 8777.28
yeah yeah you know so what's drifting

8776.16 --> 8777.84
yeah i don't know what you're talking

8777.28 --> 8780.08
about

8777.84 --> 8782.0
yeah you said stop drifting i'm using

8780.08 --> 8783.2
your words you said we still have two

8782.0 --> 8786.479
reference frames

8783.2 --> 8787.2
your words so we've got two reference

8786.479 --> 8788.8
frames

8787.2 --> 8792.240000000002
so what's in one of them and what's in

8788.8 --> 8794.8
the other it's your [ __ ] claim

8792.24 --> 8796.319
i've never said that you said we've got

8794.8 --> 8799.358999999999
two reference frames though

8796.319 --> 8802.479
you're lying bastard sorry

8799.359 --> 8804.479000000001
you said it only five minutes ago we do

8802.479 --> 8808.319
have two reference frames though

8804.479 --> 8811.358999999999
that was your words i didn't say that

8808.319 --> 8813.439
you [ __ ] lying bastard

8811.359 --> 8815.359
he acknowledged my question when you

8813.439 --> 8816.56
first came in right and i asked you is

8815.359 --> 8818.800000000001
the earth rotating

8816.56 --> 8821.039999999999
underneath the pendulum what was your

8818.8 --> 8824.319
answer

8821.04 --> 8827.439
yep virus

8824.319 --> 8830.96
yep it was yeah yeah yep right

8827.439 --> 8830.960000000001
that would be two reference trains right

8833.2 --> 8837.439
he doesn't [ __ ] know he doesn't know

8835.76 --> 8838.08
when he's saying he's got two reference

8837.439 --> 8840.24
frames

8838.08 --> 8842.72
he even said we've still got two

8840.24 --> 8844.96
reference frames that's a verbatim quote

8842.72 --> 8846.72
from him that he's just lied about the

8844.96 --> 8848.319
reality is he doesn't know when he's

8846.72 --> 8849.119999999999
claiming separate reference frames and

8848.319 --> 8850.479
when he isn't

8849.12 --> 8853.2
they don't know their own claim of

8850.479 --> 8853.199999999999
coriolis

8855.2 --> 8860.08
so what's in one reference frame and

8857.439 --> 8861.6
what's in the other

8860.08 --> 8863.439
i never claimed i never said anything

8861.6 --> 8864.960000000001
about you dumb [ __ ]

8863.439 --> 8866.56
tell me all about how you know and then

8864.96 --> 8867.919999999998
when i ask you a specific detail about

8866.56 --> 8871.439
what you've claimed

8867.92 --> 8873.92
you don't even know what you've claimed

8871.439 --> 8875.6
yes i do what's in the first reference

8873.92 --> 8879.2
phrase

8875.6 --> 8879.2
what's in the first

8880.319 --> 8885.359
what's in the first reference frame and

8882.399 --> 8885.358999999999
what's in the second

8886.64 --> 8890.56
i don't know which one i can you don't

8887.84 --> 8894.479
know you dumb [ __ ] i know you don't know

8890.56 --> 8894.479
you continually lie and say you do

8895.28 --> 8900.16
what you've told us you do understand

8898.08 --> 8903.359
james are caught

8900.16 --> 8904.8
he's just he's just dishonest why

8903.359 --> 8905.439
carrying on with him you're lying

8904.8 --> 8906.96
bastard

8905.439 --> 8908.64
you have no [ __ ] clue what you're

8906.96 --> 8909.919999999998
claiming you don't know what coriolis is

8908.64 --> 8911.358999999999
you don't know what the reference frames

8909.92 --> 8912.479
are you don't know what would be in the

8911.359 --> 8914.16
reference frames

8912.479 --> 8916.0
you know how to [ __ ] talk through me

8914.16 --> 8917.52
though don't you yeah

8916.0 --> 8919.2
you know how to talk through me while i

8917.52 --> 8922.399000000001
tell you about how stupid you are

8919.2 --> 8923.84
you know how to talk when i'm talking

8922.399 --> 8927.279999999999
yeah i asked you what's in a different

8923.84 --> 8927.28
reference frame you all got a clue

8928.24 --> 8932.64
he thinks that drift and the coriolis

8930.72 --> 8933.76
effect are two different things

8932.64 --> 8935.199999999999
that's their claim that's what they're

8933.76 --> 8936.479
trying to argue for they're trying to

8935.2 --> 8937.2
argue they're drifting the coriolis

8936.479 --> 8938.8
effects i don't know

8937.2 --> 8940.399000000001
i don't know where you came up with that

8938.8 --> 8941.759999999998
bs

8940.399 --> 8944.08
that's exactly what you're going on with

8941.76 --> 8946.08
me what i think

8944.08 --> 8947.359
he's getting right no he's right brian

8946.08 --> 8948.8
no that's fair enough we don't know what

8947.359 --> 8950.08
you think maybe you could define

8948.8 --> 8952.0
coriolis for us

8950.08 --> 8953.52
so we know what you think it is we are

8952.0 --> 8955.359
already no one oh we

8953.52 --> 8957.6
already know dewey but you don't you

8955.359 --> 8958.720000000001
dumb [ __ ] you haven't got the vagus clue

8957.6 --> 8962.0
what you're talking about

8958.72 --> 8965.279999999999
videos of me it's explaining coriolis

8962.0 --> 8965.28
to define it right now

8967.76 --> 8971.04
it should be real simple right you said

8969.6 --> 8973.6
that apparently

8971.04 --> 8975.2
the way we define coriolis was wrong so

8973.6 --> 8977.92
we're asking you

8975.2 --> 8979.68
to give us your definition of coriolis

8977.92 --> 8984.72
simple

8979.68 --> 8987.359
i i just did what while he was talking

8984.72 --> 8988.479
downstream no i started doing it and

8987.359 --> 8991.04
somebody started talking

8988.479 --> 8991.039999999999
i mean that's

8995.359 --> 8998.720000000001
conservation of angular momentum over a

8997.12 --> 8999.84
spinning body which causes things to

8998.72 --> 9001.119999999999
appear to drift even though they're

8999.84 --> 9002.880000000001
going straight

9001.12 --> 9004.640000000001
for a conservation of mental illness

9002.88 --> 9005.759999999998
conserving the momentum that's not

9004.64 --> 9007.199999999999
drifting

9005.76 --> 9010.880000000001
you don't understand what coriolis

9007.2 --> 9010.880000000001
effect that is not coriolis effect

9011.359 --> 9015.52
yeah okay they're explaining to me why

9013.68 --> 9016.319
would something deviate to the east if

9015.52 --> 9017.68
everything is

9016.319 --> 9019.439
earth turn underneath and everything

9017.68 --> 9021.359
would go west right

9019.439 --> 9022.64
yeah according to the claim that we spin

9021.359 --> 9024.0
but that doesn't happen no that's not

9022.64 --> 9025.92
according to me

9024.0 --> 9028.56
oh sorry so i claim earth spins and

9025.92 --> 9030.16
things deflect off to the west do i

9028.56 --> 9032.16
no you dumb [ __ ] that's your [ __ ]

9030.16 --> 9034.16
claim not mine how many times have i got

9032.16 --> 9037.84
to tell these globe-leaving retards

9034.16 --> 9039.119999999999
i don't claim coriolis you do

9037.84 --> 9041.12
we're telling you it's not trying to

9039.12 --> 9042.640000000001
know what coriolis is you're trying to

9041.12 --> 9045.68
understand what coriolis is

9042.64 --> 9048.88
i already know

9045.68 --> 9050.880000000001
see exactly yeah you don't know what

9048.88 --> 9053.438999999998
you're claiming even though it's a proof

9050.88 --> 9056.479
you think has earth spinning underneath

9053.439 --> 9056.479000000001
stuff not attached

9057.12 --> 9061.2
no this no no yeah you just said it's

9059.68 --> 9063.439
conservation and momentum which it isn't

9061.2 --> 9065.12
you dumb [ __ ]

9063.439 --> 9067.359
how do you know that because it's on

9065.12 --> 9068.319000000001
screen the definition for my audience

9067.359 --> 9070.16
right now

9068.319 --> 9072.0
i'm looking at a gif that's showing

9070.16 --> 9074.72
something not conserving momentum

9072.0 --> 9078.16
as it shows apparent deflection it's not

9074.72 --> 9078.16
got it in the description

9080.64 --> 9084.56
isn't that saying why you always now

9082.64 --> 9087.039999999999
maybe you'd like to cite your

9084.56 --> 9087.76
[ __ ] definition given that mine is on

9087.04 --> 9089.76
screen

9087.76 --> 9092.16
and in no way describes conservation

9089.76 --> 9092.72
momentum now give us your citation

9092.16 --> 9094.72
[ __ ]

9092.72 --> 9097.438999999998
and scroll down son give us your

9094.72 --> 9097.438999999998
citation

9098.16 --> 9101.28
i already posted it like three or four

9100.24 --> 9117.84
times in the chat

9101.28 --> 9117.84
hold on let me go find it again

9120.64 --> 9125.439
there's actually one it's actually the

9122.399 --> 9130.72
same citation that tv posted

9125.439 --> 9132.56
just read it out

9130.72 --> 9134.479
the coriolis effect sometime known as

9132.56 --> 9136.16
the coriolis force refers to an apparent

9134.479 --> 9137.92
deflection of objects such as airplanes

9136.16 --> 9139.2
winds missiles and ocean currents moving

9137.92 --> 9140.0
in a straight path relative to the

9139.2 --> 9141.359
earth's surface

9140.0 --> 9143.12
its strength is proportional to the

9141.359 --> 9145.2
speed of the earth's rotation at

9143.12 --> 9148.319000000001
different latitudes

9145.2 --> 9150.560000000001
now so that's earth rotating underneath

9148.319 --> 9152.399
so you've just defined earth rotating

9150.56 --> 9155.92
underneath and in no way describing the

9152.399 --> 9155.92
conservation of angular momentum

9156.319 --> 9161.199999999999
did you just are you a stuttering [ __ ]

9159.439 --> 9162.720000000001
you did not in any way describe

9161.2 --> 9164.399000000001
conservation momentum

9162.72 --> 9166.319
you described apparent deflection as

9164.399 --> 9167.519999999999
earth turns underneath and according to

9166.319 --> 9168.8
that citation

9167.52 --> 9172.720000000001
correct me if i'm wrong it's turning

9168.8 --> 9174.8
underneath airplanes right

9172.72 --> 9176.24
yeah so it's turning underneath

9174.8 --> 9177.759999999998
aeroplanes that would shorten flight

9176.24 --> 9178.96
times when traveling west

9177.76 --> 9181.04
if earth was turning underneath

9178.96 --> 9183.039999999999
airplanes virus that doesn't happen

9181.04 --> 9184.960000000001
but according to your citation

9183.04 --> 9186.080000000002
definitely not describing conservation

9184.96 --> 9188.399
of momentum

9186.08 --> 9190.98
it's saying earth turns underneath

9188.399 --> 9192.319
aeroplanes mate

9190.98 --> 9194.319
[Music]

9192.319 --> 9196.08
you just started from laughs for me yeah

9194.319 --> 9197.279999999999
your citation has got earth turning

9196.08 --> 9198.8
under planes

9197.28 --> 9200.24
then a flight from charlotte north

9198.8 --> 9201.84
carolina to l.a it would take an hour

9200.24 --> 9202.96
and a half and not four hours

9201.84 --> 9206.72
because earth would be turning

9202.96 --> 9209.759999999998
underneath according to your citation

9206.72 --> 9212.56
oh my god yeah oh my god blasphemy

9209.76 --> 9214.960000000001
no earth is claimed to turn underneath

9212.56 --> 9217.84
aeroplanes in your citation

9214.96 --> 9219.519999999999
that would shorten flight times it

9217.84 --> 9221.439
doesn't even say that in my citation

9219.52 --> 9224.24
you're adding this it does

9221.439 --> 9225.04
you're adding stuff to it no it's [ __ ]

9224.24 --> 9228.16
off

9225.04 --> 9231.439
what does it say say it

9228.16 --> 9231.439
again you're lying bastard

9231.68 --> 9234.880000000001
the coriolis effects also known as

9233.6 --> 9236.16
coriolis force refers to apparent

9234.88 --> 9237.358999999999
deflation of objects moving in a

9236.16 --> 9237.84
straight path relative to earth's

9237.359 --> 9239.28
surface

9237.84 --> 9241.68
the objects they named was airplane

9239.28 --> 9242.640000000001
winds missile airplanes you lying piece

9241.68 --> 9245.04
of [ __ ]

9242.64 --> 9246.319
so that would be earth turning under

9245.04 --> 9248.880000000001
aeroplanes

9246.319 --> 9251.359
exactly as you've just read out twice

9248.88 --> 9254.8
and then lied about

9251.359 --> 9256.08
so you gotta ask so you lied you piece

9254.8 --> 9259.279999999999
of [ __ ]

9256.08 --> 9262.0
yes your citation has earth

9259.28 --> 9263.68
turning under airplanes that would

9262.0 --> 9267.28
reduce flight times

9263.68 --> 9269.28
do you understand it says

9267.28 --> 9271.6
nothing about earth turning underneath

9269.28 --> 9274.960000000001
apparent deflection

9271.6 --> 9276.24
you're retards yeah you're thick as [ __ ]

9274.96 --> 9279.0
what else is going on where does it say

9276.24 --> 9281.92
earthquake underneath apparent

9279.0 --> 9284.88
deflection

9281.92 --> 9285.28
that does not say earth turn underneath

9284.88 --> 9290.24
oh

9285.28 --> 9294.0
sorry underneath all right hold on

9290.24 --> 9296.399
let's listen to this the coriolis effect

9294.0 --> 9299.04
from dotco used to be physics about the

9296.399 --> 9302.399
coriolis effect is an apparent effect

9299.04 --> 9303.84
an illusion produced by the rotating

9302.399 --> 9306.08
frame of reference

9303.84 --> 9307.2
this type of effect is also known as a

9306.08 --> 9310.08
fictitious force

9307.2 --> 9310.880000000001
or an inertial force the coriolis effect

9310.08 --> 9313.2
occurs when an

9310.88 --> 9315.039999999999
object moving along a straight path is

9313.2 --> 9316.08
viewed from a non-fixed frame of

9315.04 --> 9318.240000000002
reference

9316.08 --> 9319.28
typically this moving frame of reference

9318.24 --> 9322.24
is the earth

9319.28 --> 9322.720000000001
which rotates at a fixed speed when you

9322.24 --> 9324.399
view an

9322.72 --> 9326.0
object in the air that is following a

9324.399 --> 9328.64
straight path the object will

9326.0 --> 9329.12
appear to lose its course because of the

9328.64 --> 9332.08
earth

9329.12 --> 9333.04
rotation the object is not actually off

9332.08 --> 9335.039999999999
its course

9333.04 --> 9336.560000000001
it only appears to be doing so because

9335.04 --> 9339.84
the earth is turning

9336.56 --> 9341.92
beneath it so coriolis effect has earth

9339.84 --> 9344.72
turning underneath

9341.92 --> 9346.319
that's it yeah your your claim of

9344.72 --> 9347.679999999998
coriolis has earth turning underneath

9346.319 --> 9349.039999999999
now you didn't just read this

9347.68 --> 9350.64
you just didn't read this whole thing

9349.04 --> 9352.160000000002
i'm looking at it as your reading i

9350.64 --> 9354.479
didn't need to read the whole thing

9352.16 --> 9356.24
you're [ __ ] up

9354.479 --> 9358.319
watch your blood pressure yeah yeah

9356.24 --> 9360.479
because we're dealing with wankers

9358.319 --> 9362.0
that we define how your effect doesn't

9360.479 --> 9362.479
happen and you tell us we've defined it

9362.0 --> 9365.04
wrong

9362.479 --> 9366.319
it's your claim and when you read it out

9365.04 --> 9367.84
from your citation

9366.319 --> 9369.84
you've very specifically got earth

9367.84 --> 9371.6
turning underneath airplanes

9369.84 --> 9373.76
and if earth turns under airplanes it

9371.6 --> 9377.439
shortens their flight times

9373.76 --> 9379.28
yep okay so this is where hold on can i

9377.439 --> 9380.960000000001
this is where on his thing where he left

9379.28 --> 9382.720000000001
this is the same exact one

9380.96 --> 9384.16
main cause of the courier's effect is

9382.72 --> 9385.679999999998
earth's rotation as earth spins in a

9384.16 --> 9387.52
counterclockwise direction on this axis

9385.68 --> 9389.84
anything flying or flowing over a long

9387.52 --> 9392.24
distance above its surface is deflected

9389.84 --> 9393.04
yes so earth turns underneath airplanes

9392.24 --> 9394.72
then

9393.04 --> 9396.960000000001
so anything traveling a long distance

9394.72 --> 9399.358999999999
will have earth turning underneath it

9396.96 --> 9400.8
that would shorten flight times how many

9399.359 --> 9401.439
times you've got to explain that your

9400.8 --> 9403.358999999999
claim

9401.439 --> 9405.2
has got earth turning underneath

9403.359 --> 9406.880000000001
aeroplanes you're just going to ignore

9405.2 --> 9409.2
it

9406.88 --> 9410.0
decreasing and the coriolis effect

9409.2 --> 9412.240000000002
increases

9410.0 --> 9413.68
you just said it he just said it nathan

9412.24 --> 9415.28
the earth is moving east under the

9413.68 --> 9416.56
object he just said it he didn't even

9415.28 --> 9419.2
realize it

9416.56 --> 9420.24
he just caught us confirmed the earth

9419.2 --> 9422.08
would be spinning

9420.24 --> 9423.84
he's reading the same citation from

9422.08 --> 9426.72
kosher i got like two years ago yeah

9423.84 --> 9426.72
this is the investigation

9430.96 --> 9434.399
yes that's correct you're reading a

9432.8 --> 9437.279999999999
citation that claims

9434.399 --> 9438.319
earth turns underneath planes at 15

9437.28 --> 9440.399000000001
degrees an hour

9438.319 --> 9442.56
and that would shorten their flight

9440.399 --> 9444.56
times

9442.56 --> 9445.6
that's the problem with reading without

9444.56 --> 9449.439
comprehension

9445.6 --> 9451.12
yeah a pilot flying along the equator

9449.439 --> 9452.880000000001
itself would be able to continue flying

9451.12 --> 9453.68
along the equator without any apparent

9452.88 --> 9456.0
deflection

9453.68 --> 9457.359
i wonder why that is this is the same

9456.0 --> 9459.359
because

9457.359 --> 9461.359
the question will show us this is the

9459.359 --> 9463.12
exact same

9461.359 --> 9464.800000000001
[ __ ] you don't know the difference

9463.12 --> 9465.68
between a reference and a citation it's

9464.8 --> 9469.358999999999
the same one

9465.68 --> 9469.359
the [ __ ] that's the earth throat

9469.439 --> 9475.76
this is the same one rotate

9472.56 --> 9476.399
underneath planes yeah virus you denied

9475.76 --> 9478.64
this

9476.399 --> 9480.479
and now you've read your own citation

9478.64 --> 9482.24
you've had one read to you by cueing

9480.479 --> 9484.0
with what i'm saying yes you're not

9482.24 --> 9487.52
listening virus

9484.0 --> 9488.72
virus virus virus can you calm down calm

9487.52 --> 9492.16
your blood pressure

9488.72 --> 9494.96
ask again you've denied

9492.16 --> 9495.359
no not hold on you shut up and listen

9494.96 --> 9498.399
shut

9495.359 --> 9500.800000000001
up yeah chuckle it up fun boy

9498.399 --> 9503.039999999999
you told me to calm down i need you to

9500.8 --> 9505.84
shut up and you're still not

9503.04 --> 9508.160000000002
so papyrus you denied you're still

9505.84 --> 9510.479
muttering through me you complete wanker

9508.16 --> 9511.439
you denied the earth turns underneath

9510.479 --> 9513.279999999999
planes

9511.439 --> 9515.12
and now you've read out a citation

9513.28 --> 9516.560000000001
that's specifically detailed i've never

9515.12 --> 9520.880000000001
denied it and now you're still

9516.56 --> 9523.6
interested what a wanker

9520.88 --> 9524.96
i'll try again virus yeah yeah yeah yeah

9523.6 --> 9526.960000000001
you're just gonna keep out humming me

9524.96 --> 9529.759999999998
you are absolutely a wanker

9526.96 --> 9531.199999999999
you've denied that planes have earth

9529.76 --> 9533.6
turning underneath them

9531.2 --> 9536.640000000001
and then read out a citation that claims

9533.6 --> 9538.640000000001
exactly that

9536.64 --> 9540.0
do you not remember why are you asking

9538.64 --> 9542.08
me something

9540.0 --> 9543.04
you've denied the earth turns under

9542.08 --> 9544.64
planes

9543.04 --> 9546.560000000001
now if earth turns under planes that

9544.64 --> 9547.599999999999
have shortened flight times that's why

9546.56 --> 9549.439
it doesn't happen

9547.6 --> 9550.960000000001
you've specifically read out a citation

9549.439 --> 9553.92
that says it should

9550.96 --> 9554.479
after denying it now you deny denying it

9553.92 --> 9556.08
and you're still

9554.479 --> 9558.0
talking through me before i finish any

9556.08 --> 9560.319
sentences every time

9558.0 --> 9561.92
that's four attempts i'll try for a

9560.319 --> 9562.72
fifth attempt with him mumbling away

9561.92 --> 9565.12
through me

9562.72 --> 9566.399
wanker don't mumble through me shut your

9565.12 --> 9568.800000000001
mouth

9566.399 --> 9570.8
you've specifically denied that you

9568.8 --> 9571.438999999998
would ever claim earth turns underneath

9570.8 --> 9574.72
anything

9571.439 --> 9576.84
you denied it multiple times then whilst

9574.72 --> 9578.0
muttering through me like a complete

9576.84 --> 9581.6
prick

9578.0 --> 9584.64
seventh attempt you denied

9581.6 --> 9585.92
the earth turns underneath planes you

9584.64 --> 9588.319
said i've never claimed

9585.92 --> 9589.439
earth turns underneath planes then read

9588.319 --> 9592.96
out a citation

9589.439 --> 9595.76
that said earth turns a wanker eight

9592.96 --> 9596.96
attempts virus eight attempts do you

9595.76 --> 9598.08
think you're being reasonable you

9596.96 --> 9599.199999999999
complete prick

9598.08 --> 9601.12
are you being reasonable are you

9599.2 --> 9603.6
complete prick is this reasonable

9601.12 --> 9605.76
behavior to interrupt me eight times

9603.6 --> 9607.12
nine times i've gotta ask you the same

9605.76 --> 9607.359
question with you interrupting every

9607.12 --> 9610.240000000002
time

9607.359 --> 9611.68
10 times 11 times just keep [ __ ] shut

9610.24 --> 9615.199999999999
up

9611.68 --> 9615.76
just shut the [ __ ] up man wait from the

9615.2 --> 9617.52
finish

9615.76 --> 9619.279
then state your point he could be

9617.52 --> 9621.84
explaining it right now he still won't

9619.279 --> 9621.84
shut up will you

9624.64 --> 9629.278999999999
right yeah the moment i open my mouth he

9628.0 --> 9632.88
starts talking

9629.279 --> 9634.640000000001
you are a total bastard did it before

9632.88 --> 9636.24
you said something

9634.64 --> 9637.84
i was leaving the pause so i could ask

9636.24 --> 9639.359
the question now we're into debating how

9637.84 --> 9642.319
long a pause you've left

9639.359 --> 9643.359
shut your mouth forget dumb global head

9642.319 --> 9648.72
[ __ ]

9643.359 --> 9651.12
shut up what acting like a baby

9648.72 --> 9653.039999999999
come on man this will be my ninth

9651.12 --> 9656.0
attempt with you muttering through me

9653.04 --> 9656.0
non-stop will it

9657.6 --> 9664.960000000001
thank you you specifically denied

9661.439 --> 9667.359
earth turning underneath planes

9664.96 --> 9669.599999999999
then went and got a citation that

9667.359 --> 9673.439
specifically detailed

9669.6 --> 9676.800000000001
earth turning underneath planes

9673.439 --> 9679.04
now my question to you is a why have you

9676.8 --> 9679.92
lied about denying that you would ever

9679.04 --> 9682.240000000002
claim this

9679.92 --> 9683.84
only to then read out a citation that

9682.24 --> 9686.96
claims exactly that

9683.84 --> 9689.12
further to that virus if earth turns

9686.96 --> 9690.16
under planes exactly as claimed in your

9689.12 --> 9692.399000000001
citation

9690.16 --> 9694.16
then the flight time should be reduced

9692.399 --> 9696.72
and i'd like to address

9694.16 --> 9698.319
why you're claiming in citation earth

9696.72 --> 9704.479
turns under planes

9698.319 --> 9705.76
when that would shorten flight times

9704.479 --> 9708.08
can i speak now are you just giving a

9705.76 --> 9708.08
pause

9709.68 --> 9714.64
all right so if you remember in an

9712.72 --> 9715.84
earlier conversation we had

9714.64 --> 9718.08
somebody said something about why don't

9715.84 --> 9721.439
we see planes deviate i said

9718.08 --> 9723.2
specifically planes experience coriolis

9721.439 --> 9725.279
but they have other things to worry

9723.2 --> 9727.04
about like other winds and stuff

9725.279 --> 9730.479000000001
they have to make micro adjustments for

9727.04 --> 9730.479000000001
other things than coriolis

9730.84 --> 9735.84
uh

9733.12 --> 9737.279
okay i understand so can you explain

9735.84 --> 9739.52
this to me please virus hopefully

9737.279 --> 9742.560000000001
without interrupting me nine times

9739.52 --> 9743.68
is coriolis an effect that's observed on

9742.56 --> 9746.16
a plane

9743.68 --> 9749.52
or is it observed from the ground as you

9746.16 --> 9749.52
rotate underneath something

9751.12 --> 9754.960000000001
it will be in the non-inertial

9754.0 --> 9758.56
refrigerant

9754.96 --> 9760.16
which one's that the ground

9758.56 --> 9761.92
so when you say that the plane has got

9760.16 --> 9763.439
all sorts of things to worry about

9761.92 --> 9764.960000000001
that would be absolutely nothing to do

9763.439 --> 9766.319
with observing it from the ground as you

9764.96 --> 9769.199999999999
turn underneath it then

9766.319 --> 9769.84
so you don't understand coriolis yeah

9769.2 --> 9772.960000000001
yes

9769.84 --> 9774.56
it does it's a major part of it so

9772.96 --> 9776.479
observing something seemed to drift from

9774.56 --> 9777.278999999999
the ground needs accounting for in the

9776.479 --> 9778.96
plane does it

9777.279 --> 9782.0
no you don't understand koryos you're

9778.96 --> 9783.119999999999
incorrect the actual path that the plane

9782.0 --> 9785.6
has to worry about

9783.12 --> 9786.319000000001
is its actual path and coriolis is

9785.6 --> 9788.08
detailing

9786.319 --> 9789.439
what you observe it seem to do from the

9788.08 --> 9791.2
ground so no

9789.439 --> 9793.2
the plane hasn't got all sorts to worry

9791.2 --> 9795.52
about when it comes to coriolis effect

9793.2 --> 9796.319000000001
in fact it has absolutely stopped it

9795.52 --> 9800.84
shut

9796.319 --> 9803.278999999999
up thanks for agreeing shut up you dumb

9800.84 --> 9806.479
[ __ ]

9803.279 --> 9809.68
no you are wrong virus

9806.479 --> 9811.278999999999
the plane has absolutely nothing is that

9809.68 --> 9814.0
virus interrupting me

9811.279 --> 9814.0
of course it is

9814.56 --> 9817.92
can you stop muttering through me while

9816.16 --> 9820.24
i annihilate your point that the plane's

9817.92 --> 9822.8
got a lot to worry about with coriolis

9820.24 --> 9823.76
no virus the plane has an actual

9822.8 --> 9825.599999999999
trajectory

9823.76 --> 9827.76
and that's nothing to do with coriolis

9825.6 --> 9830.479000000001
which is observed from the ground

9827.76 --> 9832.960000000001
as you turn underneath something so know

9830.479 --> 9832.96
the plane

9836.77 --> 9842.84
[Laughter]

9838.8 --> 9845.84
you're a wanker sat coughing while i'm

9842.84 --> 9845.84
talking

9849.359 --> 9854.24
you understand what just happened man

9852.56 --> 9855.84
you understand you just said the

9854.24 --> 9856.64
non-inertial reference frame is the

9855.84 --> 9858.319
ground

9856.64 --> 9859.84
that's where the coriolis would be

9858.319 --> 9862.88
experienced

9859.84 --> 9864.56
right we'll be swinging will be seen yes

9862.88 --> 9865.278999999999
so the plane's got nothing to account

9864.56 --> 9867.68
for then

9865.279 --> 9869.439
it's only seen from the ground the plane

9867.68 --> 9871.52
does not have to account for it

9869.439 --> 9873.279
as you stated it's got a lot to worry

9871.52 --> 9876.560000000001
about well it hasn't got to worry about

9873.279 --> 9876.560000000001
coriolis you're dumb [ __ ]

9877.68 --> 9882.479000000001
what'd you say you dumb [ __ ] you don't

9880.08 --> 9886.399
need to account for it in the plane

9882.479 --> 9889.358999999999
which is what you declared incorrectly

9886.399 --> 9890.8
no i just i just said you don't have to

9889.359 --> 9891.439
because you have other things to worry

9890.8 --> 9893.599999999999
about

9891.439 --> 9895.279
not coriolis though the plane is

9893.6 --> 9896.0
irrelevant of the effect observed from

9895.279 --> 9898.640000000001
the ground

9896.0 --> 9901.2
some of you seem to be dancing past you

9898.64 --> 9903.439
need to be turning underneath planes

9901.2 --> 9905.12
to have coriolis effect and if you're

9903.439 --> 9908.08
turning underneath a plane it shortens

9905.12 --> 9908.08
its flight time

9908.64 --> 9912.0
i don't think you get it i just told you

9910.56 --> 9913.6
they don't need to account for because

9912.0 --> 9917.2
there's other factors that play

9913.6 --> 9918.56
that are what that are more than what

9917.2 --> 9920.640000000001
we're playing every time we're talking

9918.56 --> 9921.92
about korea does not have short flight

9920.64 --> 9923.199999999999
times

9921.92 --> 9925.04
yeah it would if you turn if earth's

9923.2 --> 9927.359
turning underneath the plane as is

9925.04 --> 9928.0
described in your citation then it would

9927.359 --> 9932.56
shorten flight

9928.0 --> 9932.56
times because that's turning underneath

9933.439 --> 9938.0
okay so so nathan you think that

9936.399 --> 9938.96
coriolis is just earth turning

9938.0 --> 9941.359
underneath things

9938.96 --> 9942.64
no you do that's your claim why is it

9941.359 --> 9944.720000000001
that every time we get to this stage

9942.64 --> 9947.84
it's asserted like i'm claiming

9944.72 --> 9949.278999999999
earth turns underneath [ __ ] no that's

9947.84 --> 9951.6
not what i'm saying

9949.279 --> 9952.399000000001
it's very specifically what you're

9951.6 --> 9956.800000000001
claiming

9952.399 --> 9958.8
and it would shorten flight times

9956.8 --> 9960.24
no that is not my claim yeah it is

9958.8 --> 9962.08
that's the globe claim and you're a

9960.24 --> 9965.279
globe are therefore your claim

9962.08 --> 9966.0
yes you read out your citation for your

9965.279 --> 9968.479000000001
claim

9966.0 --> 9969.52
with earth turning under planes yes it

9968.479 --> 9972.24
is your claim

9969.52 --> 9974.24
you read it out you dumb [ __ ] my queen

9972.24 --> 9974.56
oh why did you read it out then you dumb

9974.24 --> 9976.64
[ __ ]

9974.56 --> 9980.319
it was natural it's not your claim why

9976.64 --> 9980.319
did you read it out then you dumb [ __ ]

9980.479 --> 9983.84
i'm not i did not read it the way you

9982.16 --> 9985.68
just said it you read it how it was on

9983.84 --> 9987.12
the page with earth turning underneath

9985.68 --> 9987.6
planes and that would shorten flight

9987.12 --> 9989.359
times

9987.6 --> 9991.04
now you're saying it's not your claim

9989.359 --> 9993.279
even though you read it out you're just

9991.04 --> 9995.12
a liar

9993.279 --> 9996.800000000001
is he funding you know every time i talk

9995.12 --> 10000.720000000001
paige dies in discord

9996.8 --> 10003.92
guys guys in discord

10000.72 --> 10006.64
not virus is he talking through every

10003.92 --> 10006.64
word i say

10008.16 --> 10011.6
so he's not he's not listening to

10009.68 --> 10013.84
anything i say then

10011.6 --> 10013.84
nope

10015.12 --> 10018.0
what gives virus

10020.64 --> 10025.199999999999
why did you read out a claim earth turns

10023.439 --> 10026.479000000001
underneath planes to later now say that

10025.2 --> 10027.6
you're not claiming it when you've just

10026.479 --> 10030.88
read it out

10027.6 --> 10033.12
you're a liar i am i am

10030.88 --> 10035.199999999999
not can you get what i'm saying you're a

10033.12 --> 10037.439
stuttering [ __ ] liar

10035.2 --> 10038.399000000001
you just read out your claim not mine

10037.439 --> 10040.24
yours i

10038.399 --> 10041.84
had earth turning underneath airplanes

10040.24 --> 10046.319
that would shorten flight times

10041.84 --> 10048.0
it is your claim you read it out

10046.319 --> 10050.16
yeah nowhere on that page does it say

10048.0 --> 10051.439
short and flight times

10050.16 --> 10053.039999999999
yeah it does say earth turning

10051.439 --> 10054.880000000001
underneath though doesn't it and that

10053.04 --> 10058.800000000001
would shorten flight times

10054.88 --> 10060.72
if earth turned underneath flights

10058.8 --> 10062.24
why don't you go there why are you

10060.72 --> 10064.479
asking me to do something

10062.24 --> 10066.319
you simply aren't acknowledging that

10064.479 --> 10068.56
your claim you read out

10066.319 --> 10070.319
has earth turning underneath planes and

10068.56 --> 10072.96
that would shorten flight times

10070.319 --> 10074.72
that's your claim are we are we passing

10072.96 --> 10076.479
it it means my claim now

10074.72 --> 10078.24
i take it with past it being my claim

10076.479 --> 10078.64
now you you appreciate this is your

10078.24 --> 10080.16
claim

10078.64 --> 10083.84
given you read it out and you think

10080.16 --> 10083.84
earth turns under

10092.8 --> 10096.16
nathan he's saying because it doesn't

10095.12 --> 10098.880000000001
say that

10096.16 --> 10100.8
because it doesn't say it's short time

10098.88 --> 10103.039999999999
then it's not true

10100.8 --> 10104.399
you're implying it you're assuming it's

10103.04 --> 10108.0
not applying it natural

10104.399 --> 10109.039999999999
consequences from it oh my god that's

10108.0 --> 10112.319
what would happen if earth turned

10109.04 --> 10112.319000000001
underneath the plane virus

10113.52 --> 10117.84
the problem is it doesn't this guy's

10116.96 --> 10120.399
reading without

10117.84 --> 10120.399
behavior

10121.04 --> 10127.439
he's a [ __ ] i don't know what he read

10124.72 --> 10131.278999999999
this is what the model has to have them

10127.439 --> 10131.279
do they have to double speak like this

10134.96 --> 10139.839999999998
he laughed right

10147.6 --> 10150.720000000001
let me ask you a question this will be

10149.2 --> 10154.16
one of the last ones

10150.72 --> 10157.199999999999
so you admit that the earth rotates

10154.16 --> 10159.92
underneath planes correct

10157.2 --> 10160.720000000001
oh yeah that's fine okay so if a plane

10159.92 --> 10162.56
takes off

10160.72 --> 10163.84
on a runway from charlotte north

10162.56 --> 10166.08
carolina the

10163.84 --> 10167.279
the runway is facing west towards its

10166.08 --> 10170.399
targets

10167.279 --> 10173.439
lax so as soon as you get

10170.399 --> 10176.16
wheels up the earth is turning

10173.439 --> 10177.92
into the plane's face while it's in the

10176.16 --> 10180.0
air

10177.92 --> 10181.84
so that would shorten its flight time

10180.0 --> 10184.96
because the earth is turning about

10181.84 --> 10187.76
900 miles an hour from west to east

10184.96 --> 10188.08
while the plane is flying east to west

10187.76 --> 10191.12
so

10188.08 --> 10192.96
you have to add the plane's air speed

10191.12 --> 10196.960000000001
and the ground speed so let's say the

10192.96 --> 10196.96
plane's flying at 500 miles an hour

10197.279 --> 10202.16
what's what's so funny about that

10200.8 --> 10203.84
you're trying to get me to say that

10202.16 --> 10206.24
planes fly backwards no

10203.84 --> 10207.92
no i'm no i'm not i'm saying i'm trying

10206.24 --> 10209.84
to get you to understand that the

10207.92 --> 10212.24
article doesn't have to say this

10209.84 --> 10214.16
it's logically it logically follows from

10212.24 --> 10214.96
it if the earth is turning underneath

10214.16 --> 10218.0
that plane

10214.96 --> 10220.479
from charlotte north carolina

10218.0 --> 10221.52
from west to east and the plane's flying

10220.479 --> 10223.76
east to west

10221.52 --> 10224.960000000001
at 500 miles an hour then it would

10223.76 --> 10227.68
shorten the flight time

10224.96 --> 10230.708999999999
right nope nope

10227.68 --> 10230.709
[Music]

10230.8 --> 10234.56
maybe on a flat earth it probably would

10234.88 --> 10237.278999999999
alright you just said hold on let me

10236.16 --> 10239.2
just clarify what he just said he just

10237.279 --> 10241.12
said maybe on a flat earth it would

10239.2 --> 10243.279
you guys are so obsessed with making

10241.12 --> 10246.720000000001
this coriolis thing our claim

10243.279 --> 10248.84
it isn't our claim what may be on a flat

10246.72 --> 10251.119999999999
earth without earth turning underneath

10248.84 --> 10253.359
virus

10251.12 --> 10255.359
as their question again maybe on a flat

10253.359 --> 10257.12
earth we'd have earth turning underneath

10255.359 --> 10261.2
second reference frame

10257.12 --> 10264.160000000002
no mate it's your claim you read it out

10261.2 --> 10265.359
i know what i read y'all are implying

10264.16 --> 10267.119999999999
other stuff

10265.359 --> 10269.04
which is cool i don't have a problem

10267.12 --> 10272.240000000002
with it okay but y'all can't put that

10269.04 --> 10272.720000000001
explain it to you you don't have a

10272.24 --> 10274.56
problem

10272.72 --> 10276.479
with your claim the earth turns

10274.56 --> 10278.399
underneath planes we're saying we have a

10276.479 --> 10280.479
problem with that of course he's going

10278.399 --> 10281.92
to talk through every [ __ ] word

10280.479 --> 10283.358999999999
yeah we have a problem with that virus

10281.92 --> 10284.399
because if earth turns underneath planes

10283.359 --> 10285.279
if you're short of flight times and

10284.399 --> 10286.72
you're saying well it doesn't

10285.279 --> 10288.479000000001
specifically say that

10286.72 --> 10290.24
no it says earth turns underneath them

10288.479 --> 10292.0
and that would shorten flight times

10290.24 --> 10293.92
the fact that you can't comprehend that

10292.0 --> 10295.2
is a testament to your stupidity

10293.92 --> 10297.6
not because it's not logically

10295.2 --> 10299.279
consistent absolutely if earth was

10297.6 --> 10303.12
turning under aeroplanes

10299.279 --> 10303.12
it would shorten their flight times

10304.16 --> 10308.72
it didn't even say that you applied that

10305.92 --> 10310.88
as well i applied it to your claim of

10308.72 --> 10312.16
coriolis when it described having earth

10310.88 --> 10313.119999999999
turn underneath the plane to cause

10312.16 --> 10314.88
apparent deflection

10313.12 --> 10316.240000000002
from the ground as you observe it no

10314.88 --> 10317.92
that's earth turning underneath the

10316.24 --> 10318.64
plane in your description and your

10317.92 --> 10321.04
definition

10318.64 --> 10322.399
that you claim on a turning earth with a

10321.04 --> 10324.160000000002
second reference frame

10322.399 --> 10325.76
maybe on a flat earth we'd have two

10324.16 --> 10327.2
reference frames claimed

10325.76 --> 10328.800000000001
maybe you could debunk them if we

10327.2 --> 10329.84
claimed them on a flat earth maybe you

10328.8 --> 10331.199999999999
could tell us that you and your

10329.84 --> 10333.12
reference frames are ruined

10331.2 --> 10334.640000000001
on a flat earth that we don't claim

10333.12 --> 10338.720000000001
you're complete idiot

10334.64 --> 10341.92
what we don't claim coriolis

10338.72 --> 10341.92
you do it's coming

10343.68 --> 10348.319
my version how many times i don't have a

10347.439 --> 10352.08
version

10348.319 --> 10352.96
to punt i don't claim this so maybe my

10352.08 --> 10355.92
version of what

10352.96 --> 10357.119999999999
coriolis what version i don't have

10355.92 --> 10358.72
reference frames

10357.12 --> 10360.880000000001
and a claim earth turns underneath

10358.72 --> 10364.24
planes shortening flight times

10360.88 --> 10364.24
that's your claim dumbo

10364.72 --> 10367.92
yeah we know your reference range has

10366.16 --> 10369.439
been ruined of course you don't work

10367.92 --> 10371.12
sorry what reference training is this

10369.439 --> 10373.92
your version of coriolis

10371.12 --> 10374.560000000001
okay okay so it's my reference frames

10373.92 --> 10376.08
given that

10374.56 --> 10377.68
in this conversation he'll no doubt

10376.08 --> 10378.319
interrupt me five times during me saying

10377.68 --> 10379.84
this

10378.319 --> 10381.6
in this conversation you made a very

10379.84 --> 10383.2
specific point that you have a claim

10381.6 --> 10386.24
about what happens on a globe birth

10383.2 --> 10386.240000000002
at the equator with correct

10386.399 --> 10391.519999999999
who's causing that feedback who's got

10390.319 --> 10394.0
their mind wide open

10391.52 --> 10394.0
discord

10395.76 --> 10400.0
you make that claim why do you feel it's

10398.96 --> 10402.56
necessary

10400.0 --> 10404.24
to tell me that my coriolis effect and

10402.56 --> 10407.278999999999
my reference frames are ruined

10404.24 --> 10407.279
when i don't have any

10407.359 --> 10413.04
they're your versions of them not ours

10409.359 --> 10413.04
my version that i claim what with

10413.52 --> 10418.319000000001
that the globe claims that they claim

10415.68 --> 10420.0
sorry i claim that the globe claims do i

10418.319 --> 10422.319
that's a claim i'm making because i'm a

10420.0 --> 10425.12
globe head making globe claims am i

10422.319 --> 10426.08
no you're a flat so it's your claim then

10425.12 --> 10428.240000000002
not mine

10426.08 --> 10429.92
so it's my claim about your claim no

10428.24 --> 10433.359
that's just your claim

10429.92 --> 10436.72
oh no no sorry my claim about your claim

10433.359 --> 10439.68
is just your claim nope

10436.72 --> 10441.278999999999
no oh so i do make a claim about second

10439.68 --> 10443.439
reference frame earth turning underneath

10441.279 --> 10446.0
i may claim about that do i

10443.439 --> 10446.720000000001
you make a straw man claim about what we

10446.0 --> 10448.72
say

10446.72 --> 10451.519999999999
so that'll be your claim then so i

10448.72 --> 10453.358999999999
describe what you claim

10451.52 --> 10455.2
no you don't well if you did you do a

10453.359 --> 10458.24
very poor job of it

10455.2 --> 10459.12
oh of course because you telling me in a

10458.24 --> 10461.439
citation

10459.12 --> 10462.720000000001
the earth turns under planes and us

10461.439 --> 10463.6
pointing out that that would shorten

10462.72 --> 10465.92
flight times

10463.6 --> 10467.2
is met with you saying no that's not

10465.92 --> 10471.439
logically consistent

10467.2 --> 10471.439
because basically you are thick as [ __ ]

10471.84 --> 10474.64
because that's not what coriolis is

10473.6 --> 10476.640000000001
about because if that's what

10474.64 --> 10477.92
choreographed in the sun the stars and

10476.64 --> 10479.68
the moon would be

10477.92 --> 10481.68
moving because of coriolis and they yeah

10479.68 --> 10482.479000000001
that's what you're claiming you dumb

10481.68 --> 10484.64
[ __ ]

10482.479 --> 10486.96
that is precisely what the globe claims

10484.64 --> 10489.84
you idiot

10486.96 --> 10491.599999999999
you my god you thick as [ __ ] oh well if

10489.84 --> 10492.08
we had coriolis then the sun would be

10491.6 --> 10493.92
moving

10492.08 --> 10495.92
because earth's turning underneath it

10493.92 --> 10498.72
what precisely like the heliocentric

10495.92 --> 10498.72
model claims

10500.08 --> 10504.56
oh you don't claim that you don't claim

10502.64 --> 10506.64
the sun moves because earth's turning

10504.56 --> 10509.6
underneath it you dumb [ __ ]

10506.64 --> 10511.68
yes you do you dumb globe head [ __ ]

10509.6 --> 10513.84
yes that is exactly what you claim

10511.68 --> 10514.800000000001
you stupid [ __ ] you don't even know

10513.84 --> 10518.319
your own claim

10514.8 --> 10518.319
you think i claim it

10518.8 --> 10521.92
why is the sun moving

10522.24 --> 10526.08
earth rotation oh so you appreciate that

10524.8 --> 10529.519999999999
that's a claim of earth turning

10526.08 --> 10529.52
underneath and you dumb [ __ ]

10530.8 --> 10534.8
what no so why does the sun move well

10533.359 --> 10537.6
because of earth rotation

10534.8 --> 10540.24
so that's earth rotating underneath no

10537.6 --> 10540.24
let's feel bad

10540.96 --> 10546.96
right right so earth isn't turning under

10544.64 --> 10546.96
the sun

10547.76 --> 10552.08
the sun the celestial bodies do not move

10550.479 --> 10554.56
because of coriolis

10552.08 --> 10556.64
welcome to flat earth yeah welcome to

10554.56 --> 10558.56
flat earth and on rotating earth yeah

10556.64 --> 10560.479
that's right we agree virus

10558.56 --> 10562.0
the sun's movement has absolutely

10560.479 --> 10562.56
nothing to do with the claim that earth

10562.0 --> 10565.68
turns

10562.56 --> 10568.0
we agree what there's another

10565.68 --> 10568.880000000001
yeah that's right what i can't believe i

10568.0 --> 10571.6
just said that

10568.88 --> 10572.16
yeah yeah we have the exact same thing

10571.6 --> 10575.68
from

10572.16 --> 10577.119999999999
ed telling us that no coriolis effects

10575.68 --> 10578.399
got nothing to do with the sun

10577.12 --> 10580.479000000001
yeah because you don't know what

10578.399 --> 10582.0
coriolis effect is or you'd appreciate

10580.479 --> 10584.479
that on a globe earth

10582.0 --> 10586.72
you claim that's the exact cause of the

10584.479 --> 10588.319
movement of the sun earth turning

10586.72 --> 10591.039999999999
underneath you dumb [ __ ]

10588.319 --> 10591.439
that's your claim again not my claim not

10591.04 --> 10594.080000000002
my

10591.439 --> 10595.6
misunderstanding of my your claim not my

10594.08 --> 10600.24
claim of your claim

10595.6 --> 10602.960000000001
just your claim you're now debunking

10600.24 --> 10604.88
so like ed you're now saying earth

10602.96 --> 10605.599999999999
doesn't turn under the sun to cause it

10604.88 --> 10608.72
to move

10605.6 --> 10608.720000000001
welcome to flat earth

10609.359 --> 10613.52
hey welcome to the universe babe yeah

10611.84 --> 10615.76
welcome to flat earth you've just told

10613.52 --> 10619.12
us coriolis and sun movement

10615.76 --> 10621.12
aren't related so not earth turning

10619.12 --> 10623.25
under the sun then welcome to flat earth

10621.12 --> 10624.800000000001
you dumb [ __ ]

10623.25 --> 10627.12
[Laughter]

10624.8 --> 10628.8
see your misunderstanding oh it's my

10627.12 --> 10630.800000000001
misunderstanding of your dumb [ __ ]

10628.8 --> 10632.64
non-understanding of coriolis where you

10630.8 --> 10635.599999999999
tell us earth turning under the sun

10632.64 --> 10637.278999999999
isn't related to coriolis you dumb [ __ ]

10635.6 --> 10639.2
yeah i don't understand this don't are

10637.279 --> 10641.76
you dumb [ __ ]

10639.2 --> 10643.279
yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't understand

10641.76 --> 10644.64
it i don't understand how it's logically

10643.279 --> 10646.319000000001
consistent the earth turning on the

10644.64 --> 10648.56
planes would shorten flight times

10646.319 --> 10650.64
and i think that coriolis effect has

10648.56 --> 10654.08
nothing to do with earth turn in the sun

10650.64 --> 10656.16
yeah we agree earth turning has nothing

10654.08 --> 10658.16
to do with the sun's movement that

10656.16 --> 10659.119999999999
coriolis deviation we're supposed to see

10658.16 --> 10662.96
in the sun

10659.12 --> 10665.84
isn't real according to you right

10662.96 --> 10668.08
no oh you just told us coriolis and sun

10665.84 --> 10670.64
movement aren't related

10668.08 --> 10672.8
yeah i'm right oh so earth turning under

10670.64 --> 10674.479
the sun isn't causing it to move then

10672.8 --> 10676.56
so welcome to flat earth you've just

10674.479 --> 10678.8
debunked the claim that earth turn

10676.56 --> 10682.24
causes the sun movement you dumb [ __ ]

10678.8 --> 10682.24
that's a coriolis claim

10682.84 --> 10689.279
no no yeah

10685.6 --> 10690.720000000001
you dumb [ __ ] that is a coriolis

10689.279 --> 10693.68
claim you dumb [ __ ]

10690.72 --> 10694.88
that's one yeah just gonna talk over me

10693.68 --> 10697.52
okay

10694.88 --> 10698.0
well is it now your weak ass attempt to

10697.52 --> 10700.399000000001
claim i'm

10698.0 --> 10701.84
[ __ ] muting you no you dumb

10700.399 --> 10703.599999999999
[ __ ]

10701.84 --> 10705.279
coriolis is claimed to be the cause of

10703.6 --> 10706.08
the sun movement in the heliocentric

10705.279 --> 10707.92
model

10706.08 --> 10709.279
earth rotation is earth rotation yeah

10707.92 --> 10711.359
that's claimed to be the cause of the

10709.279 --> 10712.960000000001
sun moving it's called coriolis effect

10711.359 --> 10715.12
something you've just denied you dumb

10712.96 --> 10716.8
[ __ ]

10715.12 --> 10718.800000000001
that's not the reason why the the

10716.8 --> 10722.56
celestial body is moving oh why is the

10718.8 --> 10722.56
reason the celestial bodies move then

10723.359 --> 10726.399000000001
rotation just explain to me earth

10725.6 --> 10728.399000000001
rotation

10726.399 --> 10729.76
so earth moving underneath them then you

10728.399 --> 10731.519999999999
dumb [ __ ]

10729.76 --> 10733.12
so you're claiming earth turns

10731.52 --> 10734.720000000001
underneath the sun now something you've

10733.12 --> 10736.880000000001
just said isn't coriolis

10734.72 --> 10739.438999999998
when that is precisely what coriolis

10736.88 --> 10742.08
effect is

10739.439 --> 10744.960000000001
are you sure about that yeah i know what

10742.08 --> 10744.96
coriolis is

10745.84 --> 10752.0
you sure about yes you dumb [ __ ]

10749.2 --> 10753.439
i'm absolutely 100 certain that the

10752.0 --> 10755.92
globe claims

10753.439 --> 10756.960000000001
coriolis is the cause of the sun's

10755.92 --> 10759.76
movement

10756.96 --> 10761.278999999999
it isn't because we aren't spinning it

10759.76 --> 10762.800000000001
isn't because flight times would be

10761.279 --> 10764.880000000001
reduced if we had a second

10762.8 --> 10767.199999999999
non-inertial spinning reference frame

10764.88 --> 10770.0
turning underneath stuff attached

10767.2 --> 10771.76
and then detached because you threw it

10770.0 --> 10773.6
like a ball on the equator

10771.76 --> 10775.279
that would fly away a thousand miles an

10773.6 --> 10780.399000000001
hour if we were turning

10775.279 --> 10780.399000000001
underneath as is claimed with the sun

10786.24 --> 10789.92
well then there's no earth turn proof at

10788.0 --> 10793.2
15 degrees now you're dumb [ __ ]

10789.92 --> 10796.64
you've debunked earth turn then

10793.2 --> 10798.640000000001
no i didn't yes you did please

10796.64 --> 10800.8
whoever's interrupting us continually

10798.64 --> 10802.08
asking to talk please stop

10800.8 --> 10805.039999999999
clearly we're in the middle of a bloody

10802.08 --> 10807.279
conversation isn't it obvious

10805.04 --> 10808.880000000001
no virus you're debunking earth term by

10807.279 --> 10810.560000000001
saying there's no coriolis effect

10808.88 --> 10812.96
you're supposed to have 15 degrees an

10810.56 --> 10812.96
hour of it

10813.359 --> 10818.24
that'll be equator oh really so earth

10816.479 --> 10821.519999999999
stops turning underneath stuff at the

10818.24 --> 10823.039999999999
equator does it you dumb [ __ ]

10821.52 --> 10824.960000000001
well maybe if you had a further

10823.04 --> 10827.04
understanding of coriolis i do i

10824.96 --> 10828.64
understand it implicitly you are a dumb

10827.04 --> 10831.439
[ __ ] who hasn't got the vagus clue what

10828.64 --> 10835.119999999999
you're babbling about

10831.439 --> 10836.880000000001
okay no not okay you're enraging

10835.12 --> 10839.439
you're a thick [ __ ] who's come here to

10836.88 --> 10840.88
tell me i don't understand coriolis

10839.439 --> 10842.960000000001
and get me to define it like i'm

10840.88 --> 10846.88
claiming it when you claim

10842.96 --> 10849.519999999999
with citation earth turns under planes

10846.88 --> 10851.039999999999
absolutely ludicrous because we'd have

10849.52 --> 10853.68
shortened flight times

10851.04 --> 10855.52
you then deny that the sun's movement

10853.68 --> 10858.08
has anything to do with coriolis

10855.52 --> 10859.76
when it's very specifically coriolis you

10858.08 --> 10862.72
just don't understand this stuff

10859.76 --> 10862.72
even in your own model

10863.279 --> 10868.640000000001
so when would things deviate east in

10866.319 --> 10871.278999999999
your claim of earth turning underneath

10868.64 --> 10873.278999999999
you tell me you dumb [ __ ] it's your

10871.279 --> 10876.0
claim

10873.279 --> 10878.08
you know coriolis you said i don't so

10876.0 --> 10880.08
yeah i do know coriolis throw a ball off

10878.08 --> 10881.92
around about what [ __ ] seem to deviate

10880.08 --> 10883.6
because you turn underneath it there you

10881.92 --> 10886.64
go coriolis described

10883.6 --> 10889.12
that's supposed to happen on earth

10886.64 --> 10889.76
when do things deviate east it's your

10889.12 --> 10891.92
claim

10889.76 --> 10892.800000000001
on an earth that's spinning with an east

10891.92 --> 10896.88
direction

10892.8 --> 10899.039999999999
of drift or motion but just your clown

10896.88 --> 10901.039999999999
answer the question uh what my claim

10899.04 --> 10901.92
about coriolis needs justifying by your

10901.04 --> 10903.68
questioning of it

10901.92 --> 10905.279
it's not my claim dumb [ __ ] how many

10903.68 --> 10906.24
times are you all this is questioned

10905.279 --> 10909.12
right now

10906.24 --> 10911.119999999999
yeah i'm not claiming it you dumb [ __ ] i

10909.12 --> 10912.800000000001
didn't say you was claiming so why do i

10911.12 --> 10914.319000000001
need to define it and justify it then

10912.8 --> 10916.64
when you're claiming it and it doesn't

10914.319 --> 10916.64
happen

10916.8 --> 10920.64
your knowledge of coriolis is being

10918.319 --> 10923.439
questioned i don't claim it

10920.64 --> 10924.8
you do that is how you do it so you need

10923.439 --> 10927.359
to have good knowledge of it because

10924.8 --> 10930.56
you're claiming it

10927.359 --> 10933.84
you say you know coriolis i do

10930.56 --> 10936.479
throw a ball off a roundabout watch it

10933.84 --> 10936.960000000001
appear to take a curved path because you

10936.479 --> 10940.88
turn

10936.96 --> 10943.039999999999
underneath it that is coriolis effect

10940.88 --> 10944.0
and is what's supposed to happen on

10943.04 --> 10947.04
earth

10944.0 --> 10949.92
throw a ball and it should drift a

10947.04 --> 10952.240000000002
thousand miles an hour at the equator

10949.92 --> 10954.960000000001
like in my roundabout example

10952.24 --> 10957.039999999999
now if that occurred with a plane the

10954.96 --> 10958.56
flight time would be reduced because

10957.04 --> 10964.080000000002
earth would be turning

10958.56 --> 10964.08
under the plane what did they be at east

10977.439 --> 10981.12
are we yeah yeah we i know i've had to

10979.76 --> 10983.359
endure that [ __ ]

10981.12 --> 10984.319000000001
from the google panel for almost an hour

10983.359 --> 10986.56
now

10984.319 --> 10988.88
why don't you listen to your coriolis

10986.56 --> 10992.96
effect you think applies to earth

10988.88 --> 10992.96
that's not coriolis effect okay

11001.359 --> 11005.04
interrupt you asking you when things

11004.0 --> 11007.439
deviate

11005.04 --> 11009.279
east on a globe earth that spins

11007.439 --> 11010.479000000001
something you're not claiming and he is

11009.279 --> 11012.16
and doesn't understand

11010.479 --> 11015.76
he's going to interrupt you continually

11012.16 --> 11018.319
asking you to give his claim

11015.76 --> 11019.68
don't get my claim show that you

11018.319 --> 11022.24
understand coriolis

11019.68 --> 11023.76
we do i've just explained it with a

11022.24 --> 11025.359
roundabout and a ball being thrown off

11023.76 --> 11027.52
it i'll do it again

11025.359 --> 11029.2
spin on a roundabout throw a ball watch

11027.52 --> 11030.880000000001
it seem to curve away from you

11029.2 --> 11032.800000000001
as you spin underneath it that is

11030.88 --> 11034.0
coriolis and is claimed to be an

11032.8 --> 11036.479
occurrence on a spinning

11034.0 --> 11037.92
earth that would be you throw a ball it

11036.479 --> 11039.599999999999
leaves the spinning earth

11037.92 --> 11041.439
and flies away from you at whatever

11039.6 --> 11042.720000000001
latitude speed is allocated to your

11041.439 --> 11045.92
[ __ ] model

11042.72 --> 11045.92
that does not happen

11046.279 --> 11050.800000000001
hmm that's right your claim that doesn't

11049.439 --> 11053.279
happen being debunked

11050.8 --> 11054.72
maybe ask me to justify coriolis again

11053.279 --> 11056.720000000001
like i'm claiming it rather than

11054.72 --> 11058.16
debunking it

11056.72 --> 11061.519999999999
nope i didn't i didn't ask you two in

11058.16 --> 11064.56
the first place you've asked me non-stop

11061.52 --> 11066.960000000001
nothing is deviating east idiot

11064.56 --> 11069.92
the earth is not spitting idiot there is

11066.96 --> 11072.319
no deviation east idiot

11069.92 --> 11073.52
so that's not what the globe claims i'm

11072.319 --> 11075.199999999999
asking you about if you understand

11073.52 --> 11077.52
coriolis

11075.2 --> 11078.560000000001
globe claims coriolis stupid [ __ ]

11077.52 --> 11082.960000000001
completely different

11078.56 --> 11082.96
glow claims [ __ ] it's different

11085.68 --> 11089.52
all he just keeps doing is asking us to

11087.359 --> 11093.12
justify his claim things drifting

11089.52 --> 11094.560000000001
no i'm not no i'm not

11093.12 --> 11096.720000000001
what i'm asking is if you understand

11094.56 --> 11098.0
coriolis if you understand choreography

11096.72 --> 11100.8
you can answer this question

11098.0 --> 11102.88
i've explained it four times in the last

11100.8 --> 11105.199999999999
five minutes

11102.88 --> 11106.8
you haven't described anything about

11105.2 --> 11108.240000000002
emotion going east

11106.8 --> 11110.56
sorry east has nothing to do with

11108.24 --> 11113.76
coriolis deflection and everything to do

11110.56 --> 11113.76
with your globe earth claim

11114.96 --> 11118.56
you stuttering [ __ ] yeah that's right

11117.2 --> 11120.800000000001
east has everything to do

11118.56 --> 11122.8
with your claim that the spinning earth

11120.8 --> 11125.84
has coriolis coriolis is

11122.8 --> 11129.119999999999
everything goes west on the globe

11125.84 --> 11129.12
that you're climbing

11129.359 --> 11133.12
no oh my god i claim

11137.76 --> 11143.92
so no deviation then no 15 degrees now

11140.399 --> 11143.92
drift as earth turns underneath then

11144.84 --> 11148.399
virus

11146.24 --> 11150.08
mutter that we're dumb while we point

11148.399 --> 11152.24
out that nothing's drifting

11150.08 --> 11153.68
there is no earth-based coriolis the

11152.24 --> 11156.0
assignment of this west

11153.68 --> 11157.6
direction is applicable only to your

11156.0 --> 11160.64
globe earth claim

11157.6 --> 11162.56
we're not claiming that you are

11160.64 --> 11164.96
what you're claiming is that the globe

11162.56 --> 11167.039999999999
claims it i'm claiming that the globe

11164.96 --> 11168.479
you dumb [ __ ] how many times

11167.04 --> 11170.560000000001
have i got to tell you no

11168.479 --> 11172.24
no i'm not claiming that the globe i

11170.56 --> 11175.439
don't claim that you do

11172.24 --> 11179.119999999999
i'm not claiming a globe you are

11175.439 --> 11179.12
you dumb [ __ ]

11179.279 --> 11183.12
no i don't care yourself twice a kumu

11182.56 --> 11186.479
virus

11183.12 --> 11186.479000000001
you don't read it

11195.84 --> 11200.399
if you take a ball just take a ball a

11198.8 --> 11202.08
big ball and take a golf ball and hold

11200.399 --> 11205.439
it towards it and just turn that

11202.08 --> 11205.439
big ball what is happening

11205.84 --> 11209.92
i can barely hear you i have to turn it

11207.52 --> 11211.84
up say it again

11209.92 --> 11213.76
take two balls take a larger ball and a

11211.84 --> 11216.319
small ball hold the small ball

11213.76 --> 11219.52
off of the larger ball and just turn the

11216.319 --> 11219.519999999999
large ball what is happening

11220.56 --> 11225.039999999999
nothing one spinning the other or not

11222.399 --> 11226.88
what are you talking about

11225.04 --> 11229.52
so the larger ball would be your earth

11226.88 --> 11231.759999999998
that smaller ball would be your son

11229.52 --> 11233.68
that's coriolis if you are on your

11231.76 --> 11235.04
larger board

11233.68 --> 11236.24
he's not gonna listen he's not gonna

11235.04 --> 11236.960000000001
listen he's gonna interrupt you every

11236.24 --> 11238.479
word

11236.96 --> 11239.839999999998
you're into the middle of an explanation

11238.479 --> 11240.88
he's gonna start talking he's still

11239.84 --> 11245.84
doing it right now

11240.88 --> 11245.839999999998
total [ __ ] shut yeah

11251.12 --> 11255.04
he hasn't [ __ ] finished he's

11252.479 --> 11257.199999999999
explaining your stupid misapprehensions

11255.04 --> 11258.720000000001
about your own [ __ ] claim and you're

11257.2 --> 11261.04
interrupting him at every opportunity

11258.72 --> 11265.358999999999
you're doing it now you dumb [ __ ]

11261.04 --> 11267.04
shut up what else shut up

11265.359 --> 11269.279
i'm letting him know what i understood

11267.04 --> 11270.080000000002
so far don't give a [ __ ] just shut the

11269.279 --> 11272.960000000001
[ __ ] up

11270.08 --> 11273.76
we don't give a [ __ ] what you think shut

11272.96 --> 11277.679999999998
the [ __ ]

11273.76 --> 11278.399
up and with that i'm going to say a huge

11277.68 --> 11280.24
massive

11278.399 --> 11281.92
enormous thank you to both discord and
