transitioning to retirement um and I had

919.48 --> 923.1990000000001
you know I had a great time being on the

920.88 --> 925.36
show I would rather be where I'm at now

923.199 --> 928.04
but I still miss you know chatting with

925.36 --> 931.0790000000001
the guys you know no I get it and yeah

928.04 --> 935.36
I'm missing you guys too like on fed it

931.079 --> 937.519
is getting kind of silent but I mean the

935.36 --> 939.399
it's for a reason man I mean like the

937.519 --> 942.92
entire Western world is like getting

939.399 --> 945.519
screwed really bad now really bad and

942.92 --> 948.04
like I'm suffering like on this spot I'm

945.519 --> 950.759
literally now currently engaging in like

948.04 --> 952.8389999999999
hey uh could I get like 30 bucks so I

950.759 --> 958.0
can get my bike

952.839 --> 959.48
back what yeah okay I'm in that spot so

958.0 --> 962.079
it's like

959.48 --> 964.6
I'm not begging you I'm just saying like

962.079 --> 966.68
I'm in this position and like everybody

964.6 --> 970.24
seems to be like having some kind of

966.68 --> 973.6389999999999
situation out there right right

970.24 --> 977.16
now it's yeah well um it's

973.639 --> 978.759
tough I I you know I I'll take that into

977.16 --> 984.199
consideration you know I got your back

978.759 --> 985.8000000000001
on that so but um yeah so yeah it's it's

984.199 --> 989.4799999999999
it's tough out here for

985.8 --> 991.92
everybody yeah man but uh but my main

989.48 --> 994.6
mission is like to really keep my

991.92 --> 997.639
morality up it's like everything else is

994.6 --> 1000.759
[ __ ] but I can at least try to

997.639 --> 1005.199
maintain good morality in in in it all

1000.759 --> 1007.6800000000001
and thereby lose the least through

1005.199 --> 1011.56
stress eating me up because that's what

1007.68 --> 1013.88
happens in this kind of thing yeah also

1011.56 --> 1015.92
pres it's really like you have to focus

1013.88 --> 1017.48
you have to focus not to like go

1015.92 --> 1020.04
freaking

1017.48 --> 1022.759
insane know that's what I saying you got

1020.04 --> 1025.959
to preserve that sanity with with

1022.759 --> 1027.52
keeping a a tight dip grip on morality

1025.959 --> 1030.24
and just think you got to look at things

1027.52 --> 1032.839
like in the way of when I get in those

1030.24 --> 1036.959
times I look at things like I start

1032.839 --> 1041.48
looking at some somebody else's

1036.959 --> 1042.679
situation like that's worse off for me

1041.48 --> 1045.6
you know what I

1042.679 --> 1047.76
mean and and kind of like reflect on

1045.6 --> 1051.24
that and be like I may be dealing with

1047.76 --> 1053.8799999999999
this right now for a season but this

1051.24 --> 1055.919
dude or this lady right here God I'm

1053.88 --> 1058.7990000000002
glad I'm not in that situation that's

1055.919 --> 1060.6000000000001
another way to kind of look at it you

1058.799 --> 1062.12
know what I mean to kind of no that's

1060.6 --> 1063.6
exactly the way to look at it because

1062.12 --> 1065.2399999999998
even if you manage to fix it for

1063.6 --> 1067.9599999999998
yourself there's a lot of people out

1065.24 --> 1070.96
there that were aren't going to be able

1067.96 --> 1073.32
to and there's going to be a general

1070.96 --> 1076.24
Radiance of demoralization because of

1073.32 --> 1079.52
that so it's like it's this is a tough

1076.24 --> 1083.039
time and I'm basically by doing this and

1079.52 --> 1085.96
by having pre- studied being poor

1083.039 --> 1087.96
because that's real I have done that I

1085.96 --> 1089.64
have lived like super modest and try to

1087.96 --> 1092.0
figure out like how do you actually live

1089.64 --> 1095.5200000000002
like this and I've done that for years

1092.0 --> 1097.4
now and I've become I've learn a lot and

1095.52 --> 1100.0
now it's really like yeah it's all about

1097.4 --> 1102.3600000000001
keeping up morality at all costs and

1100.0 --> 1104.32
that means like if I'm going to go like

1102.36 --> 1106.28
really angry and I know it ahead of time

1104.32 --> 1109.32
because I'm super frustrated of money

1106.28 --> 1112.48
then I'm not going to do a show because

1109.32 --> 1114.32
that would spread the anger in a time

1112.48 --> 1116.159
when everybody's turning into a powder

1114.32 --> 1119.72
cake everybody's powder getting dry

1116.159 --> 1122.7600000000002
right now right so right right and just

1119.72 --> 1125.28
have to strategically do everything to

1122.76 --> 1127.6
keep morale up because that's my real

1125.28 --> 1130.48
function even though it seems kind of

1127.6 --> 1132.9189999999999
weird and unofficial it's like I have to

1130.48 --> 1134.1200000000001
show everybody that you can still hold

1132.919 --> 1136.72
on to good

1134.12 --> 1138.52
morality even when it gets this bad and

1136.72 --> 1141.52
I'm starting to think back about story

1138.52 --> 1143.76
from my grandmother too like she went

1141.52 --> 1146.12
through like hunger Winters

1143.76 --> 1148.679
here in times where people had to eat

1146.12 --> 1151.6789999999999
bark from the trees just to survive and

1148.679 --> 1154.4
that's that kind of story right well she

1151.679 --> 1158.52
got through that

1154.4 --> 1161.039
without super moral loss there you go

1158.52 --> 1163.6399999999999
didn't lose herself exactly

1161.039 --> 1166.0
yep right and a lot of people did and

1163.64 --> 1168.88
they would end up getting killed back

1166.0 --> 1171.0
then y right so

1168.88 --> 1172.88
like this is also the time when people

1171.0 --> 1175.76
are going to be more than usual

1172.88 --> 1177.72
newcomers tempted to enter criminality

1175.76 --> 1180.2
to try to compensate for the financial

1177.72 --> 1182.76
loss so there's like all these

1180.2 --> 1185.52
Temptations and moral losses everywhere

1182.76 --> 1187.559
this danger because of the financial

1185.52 --> 1191.4
Calamity that's really

1187.559 --> 1193.559
bad yep that's a fact like before there

1191.4 --> 1196.3200000000002
were issues where like oh the news oh

1193.559 --> 1198.28
this is so dangerous oh the financial

1196.32 --> 1200.28
and now it's like oh yeah it's actually

1198.28 --> 1202.1589999999999
four times as worse and we and we're

1200.28 --> 1205.44
just going to pretend like it's nothing

1202.159 --> 1209.24
now like what the [ __ ] Y and there more

1205.44 --> 1213.6000000000001
to come like holy [ __ ] and keep in mind

1209.24 --> 1219.039
what you said when when and if you do a

1213.6 --> 1223.039
show and you try to come across to your

1219.039 --> 1226.12
audience to maintain that

1223.039 --> 1229.28
morality but then you don't live by

1226.12 --> 1232.3999999999999
those same codes yeah then it doesn't

1229.28 --> 1233.799
work they they not only even if they

1232.4 --> 1235.96
don't see your

1233.799 --> 1238.559
action just through the just through the

1235.96 --> 1241.24
mere hypocrisy they're gonna read that

1238.559 --> 1243.76
and sense that from you yeah you will be

1241.24 --> 1246.84
you will be exposed and revealed just

1243.76 --> 1249.8799999999999
like many well that there's that and

1246.84 --> 1251.3999999999999
those that follow will unfortunately

1249.88 --> 1253.96
copy the

1251.4 --> 1257.1200000000001
hypocrisy there you go there you go and

1253.96 --> 1259.0
that's that's not helping anybody right

1257.12 --> 1261.0
right

1259.0 --> 1264.039
cuz you got these The Stance and the

1261.0 --> 1265.919
actions to copy from and the story and

1264.039 --> 1267.84
if you're just going to be a hypocrite

1265.919 --> 1269.72
in these kinds of times people are just

1267.84 --> 1273.08
going to be like oh well that's what we

1269.72 --> 1275.039
do then we don't know what else to do

1273.08 --> 1276.6399999999999
and then they copy it and then they copy

1275.039 --> 1278.279
the hypocrisy about it and then it

1276.64 --> 1282.5200000000002
doesn't help

1278.279 --> 1286.12
anybody especially when such nefarious

1282.52 --> 1290.6399999999999
beeds are

1286.12 --> 1294.0
noticed h they rever look up

1290.64 --> 1297.64
to that's like a child you can't tell a

1294.0 --> 1300.64
child do as I say not as I do yeah

1297.64 --> 1302.5200000000002
exactly especially now that's

1300.64 --> 1306.64
hypocrisy you can't be putting the

1302.52 --> 1308.8799999999999
needle in your arm and telling the child

1306.64 --> 1311.72
you better not be doing this that the

1308.88 --> 1315.5590000000002
other yeah that's disastrous teaching if

1311.72 --> 1318.6000000000001
you do that you can now you can say baby

1315.559 --> 1323.08
please don't be as bad as me be better

1318.6 --> 1325.32
than me I got a problem I'm sick I want

1323.08 --> 1327.8799999999999
you could be better than

1325.32 --> 1331.039
me yeah but that's

1327.88 --> 1334.8400000000001
still you know you're

1331.039 --> 1336.559
humbly but still if you do it if you say

1334.84 --> 1339.76
it's a problem is one thing but if you

1336.559 --> 1342.96
then still do it it still has a negative

1339.76 --> 1346.12
influence it still has an H hypocrisy

1342.96 --> 1347.799
example you're doing then yeah it yeah

1346.12 --> 1350.6399999999999
yeah it leaves the pothole in the long

1347.799 --> 1353.36
way right because you're just showing

1350.64 --> 1356.679
how to make excuses for your problem to

1353.36 --> 1359.52
your kid so they learn how to do

1356.679 --> 1362.2
that yep yep for whatever problem they

1359.52 --> 1364.279
come across

1362.2 --> 1367.0800000000002
exactly yeah right that's why

1364.279 --> 1370.6
confrontation facing your problems

1367.08 --> 1373.279
admitting your error and making it right

1370.6 --> 1375.08
not necessarily like oh we have to we

1373.279 --> 1376.76
have to caress everybody I have to have

1375.08 --> 1380.24
all the feelings but just like the

1376.76 --> 1382.36
honesty of it and like trying to get

1380.24 --> 1383.4
something constructive out of it that's

1382.36 --> 1385.6
really

1383.4 --> 1388.2
important but you know what this is

1385.6 --> 1389.8799999999999
every time you know you know you know

1388.2 --> 1391.919
what this is and you know I'm like you

1389.88 --> 1394.7600000000002
I'm not I'm not a religious person but I

1391.919 --> 1396.279
do understand the knowledge of the text

1394.76 --> 1398.12
scripture and there's you know whether

1396.279 --> 1400.24
you want to talk the story whether you

1398.12 --> 1401.4399999999998
want to talk about the story of job or

1400.24 --> 1403.919
whether you want to talk about that

1401.44 --> 1406.0
scripture that says the first shall be

1403.919 --> 1409.64
the last and the last shall be the first

1406.0 --> 1412.2
or the meek shall inherit the kingdom

1409.64 --> 1414.64
that means when the going gets tough in

1412.2 --> 1417.44
life not that which you think the most

1414.64 --> 1420.159
high puts upon you but that which the

1417.44 --> 1422.679
wicked puts upon you and in your faith

1420.159 --> 1425.679
and your endurance and your your your

1422.679 --> 1428.0800000000002
your your perseverance to maintain the

1425.679 --> 1432.72
code of

1428.08 --> 1435.8799999999999
righteousness you shall be the first but

1432.72 --> 1439.279
soon as you sell out so that temporary

1435.88 --> 1442.88
that temporary seemingly

1439.279 --> 1445.48
longeviti um wealth and gain by doing

1442.88 --> 1447.3200000000002
nefarious wickedness when you be the

1445.48 --> 1449.24
last oh you won't even understand what

1447.32 --> 1451.96
the last is compared to that man living

1449.24 --> 1455.6
under the bridge eating maggot and um

1451.96 --> 1457.3600000000001
dog Feast you'll be under that La you

1455.6 --> 1459.36
dig what I'm saying

1457.36 --> 1460.76
so that's what that that's what that

1459.36 --> 1463.32
whole that's what that whole scriptures

1460.76 --> 1465.72
mean right gonna get tough in this world

1463.32 --> 1467.9189999999999
and but it's brilliant you know because

1465.72 --> 1470.32
sorry to intervene but it's brilliant

1467.919 --> 1472.48
because that's like the religious way of

1470.32 --> 1475.0
looking at it but when you look at it in

1472.48 --> 1477.159
a very pragmatic way it works exactly

1475.0 --> 1480.64
the same because same way because

1477.159 --> 1482.8400000000001
morality is all about stability that you

1480.64 --> 1485.44
need the stability is your shielding as

1482.84 --> 1488.399
soon as the stability waivers you become

1485.44 --> 1490.64
vulnerable and demons literally slip in

1488.399 --> 1493.039
through other people through seductions

1490.64 --> 1495.8400000000001
that lie around you and that weakens you

1493.039 --> 1498.279
further ruins you further so it is like

1495.84 --> 1500.6789999999999
this battle

1498.279 --> 1504.52
yeah a personal battle really IM

1500.679 --> 1507.039
morality and you can like Define it

1504.52 --> 1510.039
through like biblical text and explain

1507.039 --> 1513.24
it and that works but you can also

1510.039 --> 1516.2
explain it just through

1513.24 --> 1518.64
pragmatic like semi

1516.2 --> 1521.2
spiritist explanations and it's like

1518.64 --> 1523.679
yeah it's exactly the same and it's all

1521.2 --> 1526.039
about the mechanism of what's happening

1523.679 --> 1528.919
and what that does to you and as you're

1526.039 --> 1530.48
saying here's a pragmatic Corel

1528.919 --> 1534.72
aspect

1530.48 --> 1536.64
karma karma Universal karma karma is

1534.72 --> 1539.84
what it is oh karma karma is how it

1536.64 --> 1543.3990000000001
works you know you you get what you

1539.84 --> 1546.24
reciprocate you're GNA get what you re

1543.399 --> 1549.6789999999999
what you what you put out you are going

1546.24 --> 1552.799
to get well what you put out you attract

1549.679 --> 1556.72
so it's like it's a resonance concept

1552.799 --> 1558.32
it's resonance y you reap what you sow

1556.72 --> 1560.44
sort of

1558.32 --> 1563.2
but that stuff is like really

1560.44 --> 1565.799
metaphysical because of like how it

1563.2 --> 1568.799
works it's like you you do something in

1565.799 --> 1572.48
a certain spot and then it might

1568.799 --> 1575.799
literally like go under and reemerge

1572.48 --> 1577.919
somewhere else to meet you again right

1575.799 --> 1580.44
but that's really a mystical process

1577.919 --> 1583.1200000000001
it's not so mechanical it's really

1580.44 --> 1584.799
metaphysical that part right right right

1583.12 --> 1587.1589999999999
right right so it's more than pregant

1584.799 --> 1591.2
right because actual Karma has more to

1587.159 --> 1593.24
do with like the load of your soul the

1591.2 --> 1595.72
weight which you could tie in like with

1593.24 --> 1597.6
the the scales in the Egypt version like

1595.72 --> 1600.6000000000001
weighing your heart and all that right

1597.6 --> 1603.24
it's it's all about what did you take

1600.6 --> 1606.12
upon yourself as a burden that's how I

1603.24 --> 1610.039
see it or like they say the sins of the

1606.12 --> 1613.6399999999999
sins of the Father the you know the sins

1610.039 --> 1616.72
of the father shall be punished upon the

1613.64 --> 1618.279
children the four the F the the

1616.72 --> 1620.2
successive generation

1618.279 --> 1623.64
like you may live your life and be like

1620.2 --> 1626.559
I'm living loc family blessings family

1623.64 --> 1630.3990000000001
curses there you go there's this this

1626.559 --> 1633.36
play that happens like intergenerational

1630.399 --> 1637.4799999999998
where you get like life missions through

1633.36 --> 1640.1589999999999
your family's issues the problems that

1637.48 --> 1643.039
that the the family's troubles and and

1640.159 --> 1645.5200000000002
that yeah you in that sense you

1643.039 --> 1648.399
inherent I wouldn't even say the fathers

1645.52 --> 1649.96
it's just the family that's

1648.399 --> 1652.84
right that's your roots it's a problem

1649.96 --> 1654.919
that comes with your roots yeah just

1652.84 --> 1656.8799999999999
like the person that inherits the wealth

1654.919 --> 1659.5590000000002
and be like long money they call that

1656.88 --> 1660.88
long money you can have long misery you

1659.559 --> 1663.9189999999999
be like why the hell am I in this

1660.88 --> 1666.1200000000001
situation well your great great great

1663.919 --> 1667.44
grandfather used to behead people you

1666.12 --> 1670.1999999999998
know what I'm saying I mean you never

1667.44 --> 1673.44
know right there's a couple of uh people

1670.2 --> 1675.88
on the other side waiting in a row to to

1673.44 --> 1678.96
to rectify certain things from the past

1675.88 --> 1682.279
yeah exactly well brother I got to go

1678.96 --> 1683.96
I'm about to check in all right as I say

1682.279 --> 1686.08
on the plantation but this is a much

1683.96 --> 1688.3600000000001
better Plantation than where I came from

1686.08 --> 1690.72

important like I'm not complaining about

1692.72 --> 1696.679
people not being there if they actually

1694.399 --> 1698.5189999999998
got good jobs because right right

1696.679 --> 1701.72
because my main concern is that all the

1698.519 --> 1704.76
flat earthers that have brains left that

1701.72 --> 1706.559
they all survive through this and if you

1704.76 --> 1709.559
can't be there because you you got to

1706.559 --> 1711.9189999999999
work and you make the money then all the

1709.559 --> 1714.08
blessings in the world like as long as

1711.919 --> 1717.0800000000002
you can stay afloat right and then

1714.08 --> 1721.6
eventually you might help others too

1717.08 --> 1723.1589999999999

paying your gay Away by supporting me

2174.0 --> 2179.839

2176.44 --> 2181.96
see gift gift it doesn't say anything

like

2181.96 --> 2187.0
that what's this for there's just a

2184.92 --> 2190.16
what's this for it does doesn't

2187.0 --> 2191.96
influence anything so when you do

2190.16 --> 2194.56

expertise on on like how what is gay is

2351.28 --> 2356.5600000000004
also suspicious of being gay right if

2353.839 --> 2360.56
you're too good at it too good at

2356.56 --> 2363.68
knowing what is gay enough oh oh but

2360.56 --> 2363.68
Owen hadn't thought of that

2364.64 --> 2371.44

[Music]

2394.92 --> 2401.599
anyway I SK skate yeah but ice skates

2398.64 --> 2401.5989999999997
are not

2408.4 --> 2412.8
gay cuz those blades don't

2425.359 --> 2428.359
roll

2432.4 --> 2440.839
I got this really weird idea now it's

2436.319 --> 2444.8
crazy no I'm going to undo that idea

2440.839 --> 2444.7999999999997
that was just what the [ __ ] is that

2445.52 --> 2452.4
nonsense I was thinking like what if you

2447.88 --> 2455.0
have actual like roller ice

2452.4 --> 2456.9900000000002
skates I mean like what the [ __ ] why

2455.0 --> 2458.599
does that come forth in my

2456.99 --> 2461.04
[Music]

2458.599 --> 2464.599
it's almost like you're on a on Pizza

2461.04 --> 2464.599
slicers instead of rubber

2465.76 --> 2470.3590000000004
Wheels sort

2468.04 --> 2473.48
of I wonder what the hell that would

2470.359 --> 2477.2
even do would that

2473.48 --> 2480.319
work or would it like make it completely

2477.2 --> 2483.839
not work it will probably make the

2480.319 --> 2483.839
entire experience even more

2484.48 --> 2492.319
slippery if the blade

2487.359 --> 2492.319
that cuts the ice itself is capable of

2496.88 --> 2503.079
rolling I don't know why I come up with

2499.28 --> 2503.079
these weird things

2505.599 --> 2511.2400000000002
anyway maybe it's my dormant Jew

2509.0 --> 2513.76
instinct or

2511.24 --> 2516.8799999999997
[Music]

2513.76 --> 2520.0
something yes ice skates are can be

2516.88 --> 2523.1600000000003
definitely they are blades they're like

2520.0 --> 2523.16
knives I

2525.88 --> 2533.2400000000002
know cutting firewood and working on

2528.76 --> 2536.92
your tractor cancels it out

2533.24 --> 2536.9199999999996
okay it's fair

2537.28 --> 2545.1600000000003
enough Loop no not looping ice

2541.359 --> 2547.119
skates it's just instead of a steady

2545.16 --> 2550.0789999999997
blade

2547.119 --> 2552.599
like wheel shaped blades that can

2550.079 --> 2552.599
literally

2553.359 --> 2558.24
roll you might have like a lot of them

2555.88 --> 2558.2400000000002
that are

2560.68 --> 2565.2799999999997
small it all depends on like what would

2568.04 --> 2572.72
work like would that do anything or

2570.8 --> 2575.1600000000003
would it just make the whole thing break

2572.72 --> 2578.16
quicker I don't

2575.16 --> 2578.16
know

2581.38 --> 2588.969
[Music]

2594.839 --> 2602.319
right I figure that technically the

2598.44 --> 2604.16
chances like I have no idea why I'm

2602.319 --> 2606.92
taking this as serious but it's just

2604.16 --> 2609.48
like it it probably would not be good I

2606.92 --> 2613.559
mean what's good about ice skates is

2609.48 --> 2616.96
that it's just a blade and a blade is

2613.559 --> 2618.559
well not a lot of moving parts and

2616.96 --> 2621.4
you're going to be bumping into things

2618.559 --> 2622.76
and if it's going to be small sharp

2621.4 --> 2625.7200000000003
wheels or

2622.76 --> 2629.88
whatever

2625.72 --> 2632.52
uh those skates will probably break

2629.88 --> 2634.76
quicker ah okay thanks Insanity Insanity

it is always

3005.16 --> 3008.16
implied

3012.92 --> 3019.6800000000003
uh what you're saying that

3016.4 --> 3022.76
the that this the internet stalling is

3019.68 --> 3024.5989999999997
because of my roller blading jokes W

3022.76 --> 3027.8390000000004
working kind you're in a funny mood

3024.599 --> 3027.839
today that's

3028.04 --> 3034.52
hilarious have I ever seen 10th man no

3031.96 --> 3034.52
only his

3040.16 --> 3045.44
hands right in his supposed cooking

3043.119 --> 3047.52
videos where he basically just shows off

3045.44 --> 3050.079
his wife's

3047.52 --> 3052.319
cooking and then claims it to have done

3050.079 --> 3052.319
it

3054.44 --> 3059.359
himself

3057.16 --> 3062.7599999999998
only his hands yeah he never goes on

3059.359 --> 3062.7599999999998
camera I've never seen him on

3064.76 --> 3073.6400000000003
camera or actually use his hands

3069.04 --> 3076.359
for processes that would be regarded as

3073.64 --> 3078.64
cooking it's just implied that he does

3076.359 --> 3078.64
all

3079.68 --> 3084.48
that where's Neil been lately no I don't

3082.92 --> 3087.48
yeah we we just talked about that

3084.48 --> 3089.119
Godzilla me and D Rose he's been gone

3087.48 --> 3091.76
for a while he's still out there but

3089.119 --> 3094.96
he's not showing

3091.76 --> 3098.28
up and a lot of other people as

3094.96 --> 3101.76
well 10th man is not showing up because

3098.28 --> 3104.799
well like his wife turned out to have

3101.76 --> 3108.3590000000004
breast cancer and all that

3104.799 --> 3111.4
shock reveal so he's preoccupied with

3108.359 --> 3115.119
that I really hope he makes good

3111.4 --> 3116.6800000000003
decision and not typical decisions with

3115.119 --> 3118.92
that

3116.68 --> 3122.0
I'm sure they do they're old and wise

3118.92 --> 3126.64
and self-sufficient

3122.0 --> 3128.599
so and uh yeah Neil's kind of gone I'm

3126.64 --> 3130.72
poor [ __ ] but I'm I'm going to be able

3128.599 --> 3130.7200000000003
to

3138.839 --> 3143.68
get okay this the second time OBS

3141.839 --> 3146.96
disconnected on

3143.68 --> 3149.2
me all right so talking about all the

3146.96 --> 3151.76
guys from fed like chocolate Saint's got

3149.2 --> 3155.0
a new job and that job really

3151.76 --> 3157.5200000000004
doesn't yeah it's very it's new it's

3155.0 --> 3159.28
something different and even though

3157.52 --> 3163.68
Works he is

3159.28 --> 3163.6800000000003
like mostly like too

3166.92 --> 3172.839
busy so he might just he may be on but

3170.28 --> 3174.3590000000004
sparingly and well dr's got a new job

3172.839 --> 3177.2
and it doesn't work out with the time

3174.359 --> 3180.52
schedule as he just said and and that

3177.2 --> 3186.24
seems to be happening a lot

3180.52 --> 3188.96
like Brian and Adam seem to be like the

3186.24 --> 3192.0789999999997
exceptions but Adam is also very he's

3188.96 --> 3195.68
always been busy this Pharmacy and all

3192.079 --> 3199.079
that and Ryan just gets on like half the

3195.68 --> 3202.64
time and a quarter of those half that

3199.079 --> 3202.6400000000003
times he's like in a cranky

3204.16 --> 3212.96
mood or like a obsessive mood not

3208.44 --> 3218.2400000000002
cranky uh so yeah I don't know

3212.96 --> 3218.2400000000002
it's it's winter the winter is

3234.16 --> 3237.52
coming

3235.68 --> 3241.0789999999997
should flat earthers care that

3237.52 --> 3242.88
mainstream science doesn't seem to care

3241.079 --> 3244.6400000000003
what flat earthers

3242.88 --> 3249.839
think

3244.64 --> 3252.839
uh it's all hilarious to us

3249.839 --> 3252.839
flatland

3253.4 --> 3259.319
because of course they shouldn't care

3256.559 --> 3262.52
what flat earthers think but they

3259.319 --> 3266.2
will because the Earth is flat they're

3262.52 --> 3270.92
liars and US pointing at the truth will

3266.2 --> 3270.9199999999996
mess them up mess up their easy

3271.48 --> 3276.64
programming and so ironically they will

3274.359 --> 3279.72
always end up whining about flat

3276.64 --> 3280.64
earthers which actually greatly enforces

3279.72 --> 3283.1189999999997
our

3280.64 --> 3284.7599999999998
position because they keep reminding

3283.119 --> 3288.0
people about

3284.76 --> 3289.44
it like in in a in a bit for help almost

3288.0 --> 3292.48
like could you please help us against

3289.44 --> 3295.68
these flat earthers but all that happens

3292.48 --> 3297.2400000000002
is that people that are oblivious to it

3295.68 --> 3299.2799999999997
that are still falling for the trick

3297.24 --> 3301.4799999999996
will only be like why are you bringing

3299.28 --> 3303.4
up flat

3301.48 --> 3306.72
earthers what the

3303.4 --> 3307.76
[ __ ] and they will then maybe be seduced

3306.72 --> 3310.9199999999996
to take a

3307.76 --> 3312.96
peak or follow a lead of a flat earther

3310.92 --> 3315.119
popping up and saying something and like

3312.96 --> 3319.4
leaving a link like here let's check

3315.119 --> 3319.4
this out yeah that's what happens

3320.16 --> 3327.0789999999997
because the supposed ballers in NASA

3323.72 --> 3329.0389999999998
because they bring it up if they

3327.079 --> 3331.6400000000003
wouldn't bring it up then Flat Earth are

3329.039 --> 3334.8390000000004
saying Earth is flat oh link might his

3331.64 --> 3338.0389999999998
website that would just be seen as spam

3334.839 --> 3341.599
but because the freaking NASA people and

3338.039 --> 3345.2000000000003
and Ballers themselves ball talkers they

3341.599 --> 3348.599
bring it up that

3345.2 --> 3353.2
like that only just sends people to Flat

3348.599 --> 3353.2000000000003
Earth effectively it it's what

3354.0 --> 3360.119
happens

3356.799 --> 3363.079
or sense what it does it kind of like

3360.119 --> 3364.7200000000003
forces everybody that's there to make a

3363.079 --> 3366.599
choice to like are you going to be an

3364.72 --> 3368.52
anti flat earther or are you going to be

3366.599 --> 3371.88
a flat

3368.52 --> 3374.0
earther like that are you going to side

3371.88 --> 3375.88
with complete nonsense and just

3374.0 --> 3377.559
Fabrications that haven't been proven

3375.88 --> 3380.359
but that will be

3377.559 --> 3383.92
accepted or are you going to actually

3380.359 --> 3386.92
just get get

3383.92 --> 3386.92
real

3413.88 --> 3416.88
for

3421.68 --> 3427.5589999999997
right so I find it very hilarious when

3423.799 --> 3431.359
there's like ball story

3427.559 --> 3433.52
Wizards that get that can't help but

3431.359 --> 3436.319
bring up Flat Earth they have to mention

3433.52 --> 3437.96
it some like that is like really funny

3436.319 --> 3440.68
to

3437.96 --> 3443.76
me cuz that's like truth

3440.68 --> 3446.8799999999997
magic it's like they are trying to hold

3443.76 --> 3448.44
off the truth in favor of a very

3446.88 --> 3451.44
specific

3448.44 --> 3454.92
man-made view of

3451.44 --> 3458.079
things and then they can't help but

3454.92 --> 3459.039
bring up the thing that actually undoes

3458.079 --> 3463.7200000000003
it

3459.039 --> 3463.7200000000003
all that's like

3465.48 --> 3472.2
amazing that's like secret surface stuff

3468.52 --> 3474.359
except it's God through information

3472.2 --> 3476.799
through the truth just doing that like

3474.359 --> 3478.64
getting two people and then they bring

3476.799 --> 3482.0
it

3478.64 --> 3482.0
forth that's

3485.55 --> 3493.369
[Music]

3495.839 --> 3502.319
amazing right you bring forth what is on

3498.88 --> 3506.7200000000003
your heart whether you understand the

3502.319 --> 3506.72
implications of it or not

3514.48 --> 3519.72
if you're frustrated about Flat

3517.44 --> 3521.44
Earth well then obviously if you're

3519.72 --> 3522.9199999999996
going to express it then you don't

3521.44 --> 3525.28
understand why you're so frustrated

3522.92 --> 3528.6800000000003
about Flat

3525.28 --> 3530.92
Earth you're not being honest about it

3528.68 --> 3534.44
because if you really think about it and

3530.92 --> 3537.52
feel carefully You' realize like yeah I

3534.44 --> 3539.44
I despise it because it ruins what I'm

3537.52 --> 3544.079
doing it

3539.44 --> 3544.079
ruins the idea of the globe

3544.799 --> 3549.52
cosmology and that's really why they're

3547.64 --> 3552.72
on your mind they're ruining your

3549.52 --> 3555.28
Wizardry they're ruining your magic the

3552.72 --> 3560.2
condoned

3555.28 --> 3563.2000000000003
consens internationally agreed upon

3560.2 --> 3563.2
magic

3563.64 --> 3566.64
h

3579.68 --> 3583.3799999999997
[Music]

3597.039 --> 3599.92
consensus

3601.07 --> 3605.53
[Music]

3606.0 --> 3612.039
truth this self-contradicting really

3609.079 --> 3615.559
consensus truth there is no real there's

3612.039 --> 3618.7990000000004
a consensus or there is the truth

3615.559 --> 3621.039
they're not they're as compatible as oil

3618.799 --> 3621.0389999999998
and

3621.52 --> 3628.2
water you might have some kind of ulion

3624.599 --> 3628.2000000000003
temporarily but it's not going to

3628.4 --> 3631.61
[Music]

3653.52 --> 3656.52
last

3662.28 --> 3665.48
what what are you guys talking

3665.72 --> 3671.68
about

3667.52 --> 3671.68
tilt tilt

3683.44 --> 3686.44
what

3690.4 --> 3697.079
yeah see what you did there teret now a

3692.48 --> 3697.079
kumu virus feels all reinforced

3697.5 --> 3702.6
[Music]

3711.72 --> 3715.64
again the Earth is flat white as your

3714.039 --> 3720.6400000000003
bike need need round

3715.64 --> 3723.839
tires uh all righty

3720.64 --> 3725.97
then it's because flat tires don't roll

3723.839 --> 3729.18
very

3725.97 --> 3729.18
[Music]

3731.31 --> 3736.68
[Music]

3734.24 --> 3739.799
well and it's kind of funny because

3736.68 --> 3743.0
originally tires didn't have air in them

3739.799 --> 3746.64
did you know they were just strips of

3743.0 --> 3749.799
rubber and before that just wooden cart

3746.64 --> 3750.839
wheels but they would always go buff

3749.799 --> 3754.0389999999998
they would

3750.839 --> 3757.44
damage why they put the air in the

3754.039 --> 3761.2000000000003
wheels is because it would

3757.44 --> 3764.48
like absorb the shock and then cause it

3761.2 --> 3767.4399999999996
to damage less over time it would wear

3764.48 --> 3767.44
out

3773.039 --> 3781.3190000000004
slower so the air in Wheels is all about

3777.72 --> 3785.359
preventing damage to the

3781.319 --> 3788.279
material shock shock absorption for the

3785.359 --> 3790.88
rubber isn't that

3788.279 --> 3792.76
amazing because it didn't start out with

3790.88 --> 3794.359
with it right originally it was just a

3792.76 --> 3796.6400000000003
wooden

3794.359 --> 3797.48
cartwheel and they yeah they would last

3796.64 --> 3799.7599999999998
a

3797.48 --> 3803.279
bit but not forever they would

3799.76 --> 3806.96
eventually just shatter

3803.279 --> 3809.599
always well then with the rubber that

3806.96 --> 3813.52
shattering would take a lot

3809.599 --> 3815.76
longer but then when some brilliant guy

3813.52 --> 3816.839
somehow figured out that hey maybe you

3815.76 --> 3821.5200000000004
could

3816.839 --> 3824.359
like use an air cushion for the

3821.52 --> 3828.88
wheel and that just changed everything

3824.359 --> 3828.88
it was genius person who figured that

3830.64 --> 3837.72
out air in Wheels was a magnific genius

3838.2 --> 3843.2
unbelievable and how the hell do you

3840.279 --> 3845.16
come up with that like that part

3843.2 --> 3848.8799999999997
especially how the hell do you come up

3845.16 --> 3848.8799999999997
with that that's just like

3849.359 --> 3853.5989999999997
what that's pretty damn

3855.36 --> 3860.05
[Music]

3863.2 --> 3869.359
creative

3865.16 --> 3872.2
refracted retracted tires

3869.359 --> 3873.7599999999998
what that your bike travel beyond the

3872.2 --> 3876.5989999999997
rise okay this is getting weird now

3873.76 --> 3876.599
Woodwork and G

3893.16 --> 3896.16
bear

3903.279 --> 3906.119
Sun's

3906.2 --> 3911.7599999999998
path yeah but the weird thing is look

3908.599 --> 3913.96
Tera your everything you're all

3911.76 --> 3916.44
expressing which is what makes it

3913.96 --> 3920.68
resonate with the globe model so

3916.44 --> 3923.839
much is that you're all actualizing it

3920.68 --> 3926.279
when all the celestials and how they

3923.839 --> 3929.16
move they only move with angular speeds

3926.279 --> 3932.16
and it's like how the sun moves across

3929.16 --> 3934.0
the sky is like an arc with a perfectly

3932.16 --> 3939.0389999999998
consistent angular

3934.0 --> 3943.72
speed but that Arc literally differs

3939.039 --> 3947.3590000000004
from day to day and it's not like during

3943.72 --> 3950.799
the path it changes

3947.359 --> 3953.839
no when it goes out it's gone and it's

3950.799 --> 3958.799
night and it reemerges it's a different

3953.839 --> 3961.92
path but that new specific unique path

3958.799 --> 3964.319
of that day is at a perfectly angular

3961.92 --> 3968.119
consistent speed even though it might

3964.319 --> 3971.279
have changed microns of

3968.119 --> 3972.6400000000003
difference compared to the previous day

3971.279 --> 3976.44
and

3972.64 --> 3979.0389999999998
that no physicality assumption

3976.44 --> 3982.92
bias-based models is going to freaking

3979.039 --> 3982.92
fix that those surreal

3983.0 --> 3986.0
facts

3986.119 --> 3991.6800000000003
I mean the celestials are like a

3987.92 --> 3994.16
magician trick it's unbelievable what's

3991.68 --> 3996.2
happening so there's this spectacle

3994.16 --> 3998.7599999999998
visual spectacle that

3996.2 --> 4001.5589999999997
appears light and cast shadows and

3998.76 --> 4004.039
everything but the Shadows that's weird

4001.559 --> 4005.48
man because in one place gives certain

4004.039 --> 4007.8390000000004
shadows in another place it gives

4005.48 --> 4009.279
different shadows to that Observer I

4007.839 --> 4013.119
mean what the

4009.279 --> 4014.68
hell but then like it's perfectly

4013.119 --> 4018.359
angular

4014.68 --> 4020.319
consistent the speed it moves across

4018.359 --> 4022.64
across your view you can't even say

4020.319 --> 4025.72
across the sky because you can't prove

4022.64 --> 4030.799
any location it's just in your view the

4025.72 --> 4036.8799999999997
angle consistent then it disappears from

4030.799 --> 4039.52
view it like goes under right and then

4036.88 --> 4042.2400000000002
well you could sort of calculate in your

4039.52 --> 4044.48
mind like how the circle around your

4042.24 --> 4047.7599999999998
view underneath your feet would

4044.48 --> 4049.48
continue and then reemerge but then as

4047.76 --> 4053.2000000000003
it

4049.48 --> 4056.599
reemerges it's not the same

4053.2 --> 4059.9199999999996
path it's like a brand new Sun a

4056.599 --> 4061.839
uniquely new

4059.92 --> 4064.2000000000003
effect

4061.839 --> 4070.0389999999998
reemerges in the

4064.2 --> 4072.9199999999996
morning it's a unique new Sun

4070.039 --> 4075.2400000000002
effect

4072.92 --> 4078.0
yeah

4075.24 --> 4082.3999999999996
that's how amazing it really

4078.0 --> 4082.4
is you can't model this

4082.559 --> 4089.279
thing not you can't model it into

4085.72 --> 4089.279
something physical you just

4090.079 --> 4093.599
can't it's too

4097.319 --> 4102.679
surreal if the Earth was ecliptical path

4100.319 --> 4106.159000000001
shouldn't the sun's speed change

4102.679 --> 4108.6
over would yeah would dude there's all

4106.159 --> 4109.5199999999995
kinds of issues with speeds and orbits

4108.6 --> 4111.96
and

4109.52 --> 4114.2390000000005
inconsistence like little

4111.96 --> 4118.6
things but for

4114.239 --> 4121.678999999999
example let's just say if an ecliptical

4118.6 --> 4125.939
path then angular sizes should be

4121.679 --> 4129.129
changing in accordance and they

4125.939 --> 4129.129
[Music]

4132.799 --> 4135.799
don't

4143.96 --> 4148.839
yeah thanks for the moderating clutch

4146.96 --> 4152.44
but the

4148.839 --> 4157.239
yeah the angular size of the the

4152.44 --> 4159.759
sun doesn't really change it the it

4157.239 --> 4162.3589999999995
there's some things about it that change

4159.759 --> 4166.799
during the different

4162.359 --> 4168.08
seasons but those sort of changes don't

4166.799 --> 4172.12
really

4168.08 --> 4175.839
match any geometric

4172.12 --> 4177.96
model right about assumptions of objects

4175.839 --> 4179.679
being in specific positions in relation

4177.96 --> 4182.679
to ball earth

4179.679 --> 4182.679
like

4184.199 --> 4191.5199999999995
no right like especially the Moon Man

4187.759 --> 4191.52
the moon like

4192.719 --> 4197.44
oh

4194.96 --> 4199.88
of all things the Moon being relatively

4197.44 --> 4202.879999999999
close supposedly in the heliocentric

4199.88 --> 4205.11
model like its angular size should be

4202.88 --> 4206.400000000001
continually

4205.11 --> 4208.96
[Music]

4206.4 --> 4213.639999999999
changing like much more dramatically

4208.96 --> 4213.64
than all the other celestials yet it

4222.64 --> 4227.839
doesn't

4223.89 --> 4227.839
[Music]

4230.92 --> 4237.4
right do you know any physical

4234.44 --> 4238.4
objects out there to which perspective

4237.4 --> 4240.92
doesn't

4238.4 --> 4242.96
apply I mean it's a physical object but

4240.92 --> 4247.64
it's always the

4242.96 --> 4252.44
same angular size like

4247.64 --> 4255.88
yes that's logical is

4252.44 --> 4258.44
it the moon size does change what the

4255.88 --> 4258.4400000000005
[ __ ] are you

4258.64 --> 4261.64
saying

4262.159 --> 4267.879999999999
what you actually think the oh app

4265.32 --> 4270.96
parent size okay fair enough good that

4267.88 --> 4273.4400000000005
you corrected that yeah but it doesn't

4270.96 --> 4273.44
really

4275.679 --> 4281.28
though there's seasonal changes there's

4278.6 --> 4285.88
not positional

4281.28 --> 4289.44
changes there's not like hey it's more

4285.88 --> 4292.04
over there so it's B it's smaller now

4289.44 --> 4294.36
right when the moon is over it should be

4292.04 --> 4296.88
at bigger because it's right in front of

4294.36 --> 4298.799999999999
you when it's all at the Horizon

4296.88 --> 4302.52
supposedly if you think of the Horizon

4298.8 --> 4304.76
as being a curve well then it should be

4302.52 --> 4307.2390000000005
literally at a greater distance from you

4304.76 --> 4310.6
as an observer and it should be

4307.239 --> 4310.599999999999
smaller but it

4312.56 --> 4315.56
isn't

4325.239 --> 4329.5199999999995
temperatur I don't even get me started

4327.84 --> 4334.4400000000005
about seasons and temperatures

4329.52 --> 4334.4400000000005
woodworking guny bear it's such a

4337.32 --> 4342.48
mess when the explanation of the Season

4340.56 --> 4345.400000000001
isn't linked to the

4342.48 --> 4349.678999999999
distance yeah it

4345.4 --> 4349.679
is yes it is Red

4352.44 --> 4357.4
Socks I I know this might be a

4354.84 --> 4362.400000000001
disappointing shock to you

4357.4 --> 4362.4
concerning the globe lore but it

4363.199 --> 4370.0
is no not this yeah distance not tilt

4368.0 --> 4373.679
tilt is only one

4370.0 --> 4377.04
aspect yeah the Earth moves supposedly

4373.679 --> 4379.4400000000005
in a heliocentric model in an elliptical

4377.04 --> 4382.76
orbit around the Sun and that elliptical

4379.44 --> 4387.4
orbit is of direct consequence for the

4382.76 --> 4390.400000000001
seasons alongside the supposed

4387.4 --> 4390.4
tilt

4395.199 --> 4398.879999999999
yeah you're getting it

4399.96 --> 4405.36
wrong

4402.36 --> 4405.36
right

4417.09 --> 4423.400000000001
[Music]

4420.0 --> 4425.92
to by far the overwhelming aspect so so

4423.4 --> 4429.08
the distance to the sun doesn't matter

4425.92 --> 4432.36
then Red Socks it's only the angle of

4429.08 --> 4435.36
the earth that really matters

4432.36 --> 4435.36
then

4435.84 --> 4440.400000000001
that's

4437.239 --> 4442.12
insane how can distance to a heat Source

4440.4 --> 4446.08
not

4442.12 --> 4449.4
matter how can the distance to a heat

4446.08 --> 4453.239
Source not matter for the

4449.4 --> 4453.239
temperature that's

4454.41 --> 4458.199
[Music]

4462.28 --> 4465.28
insane

4469.159 --> 4471.36
damn

4474.19 --> 4477.839999999999
[Music]

4492.28 --> 4495.28
it

4502.48 --> 4510.159
two that's ridiculous no it isn't it's

4506.12 --> 4513.12
an elliptical Orit it's not 2%

4510.159 --> 4517.0
difference the [ __ ] is wrong with

4513.12 --> 4517.0
you hey seeking star

4522.199 --> 4530.239
water it's not a circular orbit with 2%

4526.84 --> 4534.96
deviation making it just microscopically

4530.239 --> 4534.959999999999
elliptical yeah that's not the claim at

4535.12 --> 4543.96
all might want to reconsider rewriting

4538.719 --> 4543.96
The Helio Centric model there go Red

4552.199 --> 4560.199
Sox

4555.0 --> 4560.199
what's the claimed closest and furthest

4561.08 --> 4566.28
distance it was around like 93 million

4566.96 --> 4570.36
miles I don't

4571.679 --> 4578.2390000000005
care it's an elliptical path it's

4574.92 --> 4581.719
claimed to be an elliptical path not a

4578.239 --> 4584.199
circle where that's just microscopically

4581.719 --> 4588.0
elliptical which is what you're

4584.199 --> 4588.0
describing it's not what it

4612.08 --> 4615.08
says

4630.199 --> 4636.15
this guy makes me want to throw

4633.199 --> 4639.389999999999

[Music]

4640.44 --> 4645.32
ballart I'm not going to entertain it

4642.6 --> 4647.84
any f you don't have to look anything up

4645.32 --> 4650.5599999999995
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] the Earth is flat

4647.84 --> 4655.12
heliocentric model is

bunk I don't care how you how [ __ ]

4655.12 --> 4660.199
math retards out there manage to put

something together it doesn't work it

4660.199 --> 4662.599999999999
never

4664.32 --> 4669.96
did yeah yeah

4667.08 --> 4672.28
yeah please go spout your science

4669.96 --> 4673.9800000000005
science fiction factoid somewhere else

4672.28 --> 4677.15
thanks

you Red

[Music]

4698.04 --> 4703.6
Sox so now you don't want to discuss it

4701.04 --> 4706.76
discuss what your horeshit made up

4703.6 --> 4709.280000000001
[ __ ] numbers Red Sox your horeshit

4706.76 --> 4709.280000000001
made up

4709.32 --> 4715.84
numbers based on things that have never

been proven your calculated astronomical

your astronomical

4731.92 --> 4736.719
horeshit

4733.76 --> 4739.96
like to stick to the really is and

4736.719 --> 4743.0
really know and figuring it out instead

4739.96 --> 4745.08
of wasting our time on stupid

4743.0 --> 4747.639
calculation

4745.08 --> 4751.5199999999995
nonsense about presuppositions that have

4747.639 --> 4755.0
never been proved and will never be

4751.52 --> 4757.320000000001
proved yeah Earth is flat can't have gas

4755.0 --> 4759.679
pressure without a

4757.32 --> 4761.84
container Earth is

4759.679 --> 4764.84
stationary it's not

moving

4768.159 --> 4774.719
Celestial lights are intangible we only

4770.88 --> 4774.719
have angular

4781.92 --> 4787.72

cool and I'm pretty damn sure that in 10

4848.32 --> 4855.4
years it's going to be different cuz

4851.48 --> 4859.32
you're [ __ ] math soup will give you

4855.4 --> 4861.28
other nonsense fictional parameters to

4859.32 --> 4863.32
make your calculation with so you will

4861.28 --> 4866.5199999999995
have a different [ __ ] number rolling

4863.32 --> 4869.679
out of that fictional hor [ __ ] Red

4866.52 --> 4873.080000000001

fictional or [ __ ] have fun with that it

4873.08 --> 4880.5199999999995
doesn't mean anything it doesn't prove

4875.28 --> 4880.5199999999995

cob should stop watching all the no but

4918.8 --> 4924.28
they

4919.44 --> 4924.28
don't they don't do that hey tin foil

4929.719 --> 4935.56
cat right tin yeah I mean come on hatte

4935.6 --> 4942.679
Source they can't think about heat

4938.88 --> 4944.92
Source can't do it I have to get into

4942.679 --> 4947.92
Second Law thermodynamics again and all

4944.92 --> 4950.96
that I can't think about that I mean

4947.92 --> 4954.32
they have trouble enough with just light

4950.96 --> 4958.96
and like angular information already you

4954.32 --> 4958.96
can't like actually get physics into

4959.159 --> 4965.159
this cuz then they have to like bring up

4962.159 --> 4968.239
like nonsense stories about like how

4965.159 --> 4971.0
radio signals like turn into a laser in

4968.239 --> 4974.0
a vacuum and that kind of hor

4971.0 --> 4976.32
[ __ ] yeah

4974.0 --> 4979.96
and that oh you can only see the stars

4976.32 --> 4981.639
at ground level because oh there's like

4979.96 --> 4984.639
this

4981.639 --> 4986.84
spectral amplification of the atmosphere

4984.639 --> 4988.36
from The Starlight you can't see it

4986.84 --> 4992.28
they're still there you just can't see

4988.36 --> 4994.96
it like yeah the madeup horeshit stories

4992.28 --> 4995.88
for heliocentrism to try and explain

4994.96 --> 4998.96
these

4995.88 --> 5004.4800000000005
bizarre phenomena that we actually get

5031.48 --> 5040.4
wow that Red Sox don't you know that

5037.32 --> 5045.28
dark matter only

5040.4 --> 5048.44
exists because of Newtonian gravity not

5045.28 --> 5052.719
working out in the

5048.44 --> 5052.719
math you don't even know

5054.08 --> 5057.96
that where the hell have you

5061.36 --> 5064.36
been

5068.36 --> 5076.759999999999
no it's not guesswork it's not

5073.239 --> 5081.239
guesswork you see there's no guesswork

5076.76 --> 5085.360000000001
involved it's patch work not guesswork

5081.239 --> 5086.678999999999
patch work yeah the gravity they used

5085.36 --> 5089.639
didn't work

5086.679 --> 5095.1990000000005
out mathematically they couldn't get it

5089.639 --> 5096.4400000000005
to work so they had to have a patch work

5095.199 --> 5099.799999999999
yeah a

5096.44 --> 5103.08
Band-Aid to make it stop bleeding to

5099.8 --> 5106.1990000000005
death that Patchwork was called dark

intervention of mathematics to sort of

5109.639 --> 5116.36
balance the equation that's literally

5112.36 --> 5119.759999999999
what dark matter is not guesswork it's a

5116.36 --> 5122.339999999999
mathematical surgical

intervention of Reality by the way

just make up some [ __ ] to try to balance

glasses

5184.639 --> 5191.4800000000005
typical uh you're not supposed to wear

5188.36 --> 5194.88
red socks when you're a man but I mean

5191.48 --> 5198.0
you're into astrophysics and nonsense so

5194.88 --> 5202.28
this is probably all

5198.0 --> 5202.28
wasted wasted tips on

5206.8 --> 5212.4400000000005
you must be a Yankee s yeah probably

steamy traveler welcome by the way good

5212.44 --> 5219.96

5222.44 --> 5229.5599999999995
right oh so bad

5226.04 --> 5232.88
oh hey you're talking about freaking

5232.88 --> 5237.679
that [ __ ] yeah that's

nice hangout and not just make it all

5267.159 --> 5274.08
about some [ __ ] astrophysics wanking

5269.719 --> 5278.08
gamma in my chat where has gay Red Socks

5274.08 --> 5278.08
and then no it doesn't so

5281.4 --> 5287.799999999999
pretty that I don't understand it just

5285.28 --> 5289.96
explaining the horeshit based on

5287.8 --> 5291.84
presuppositions that require a flat

5289.96 --> 5295.2390000000005
plain measurement

5291.84 --> 5297.88
yeah yeah Earth is flat yeah we don't

5295.239 --> 5300.879999999999
need to understand your heliocentric

5297.88 --> 5303.36
horseshit model because the Earth is

5300.88 --> 5306.1990000000005
flat and your hel Centric horseshit

5303.36 --> 5307.799999999999
model doesn't exist is mathematical

5306.199 --> 5312.879999999999
science

5307.8 --> 5314.6
fiction yeah nobody needs to know it it

5312.88 --> 5317.2390000000005
doesn't help

anything doesn't make you smarter or

[Music]

5340.08 --> 5345.719
yeah I mean if you knew how the the

5343.239 --> 5348.28
celestials had

5345.719 --> 5350.52
influences and like when comets can

5348.28 --> 5353.88
appear in that kind of thing the actual

5350.52 --> 5356.400000000001
astrology part of it that's useful

5353.88 --> 5359.52
information because that has actual

5356.4 --> 5363.32
influence on what happens here in the

5359.52 --> 5366.84

5363.32 --> 5368.84
presupposed distances and geometric

5366.84 --> 5371.28
things that are supposedly happening

5368.84 --> 5373.679
that's all made up horeshit and it

5371.28 --> 5377.0
doesn't benefit

5373.679 --> 5380.0
anything it's just a stupid geometric

5377.0 --> 5381.159
game in your head you're playing it's

5380.0 --> 5383.199
just a

theory it's not a

hypothesis it's a horeshit made up

5442.76 --> 5447.719
idea created by a Jesuit priest in the

5458.76 --> 5464.6
the lore like the freaking Big Bang like

5461.719 --> 5467.2390000000005
so it's a theory no it's not a theory

5464.6 --> 5470.0
hypothesis no it isn't a hypothesis it's

5467.239 --> 5473.879999999999
just a madeup piece of [ __ ] horeshit

entropy entropy yeah you can't have

5489.28 --> 5496.199
something from nothing and that's

final that's final can't have something

5496.199 --> 5500.48
from

5498.04 --> 5504.239
nothing yeah

5500.48 --> 5505.759999999999
and entropy increases over time so you

5504.239 --> 5510.28
can't

5505.76 --> 5513.159000000001
have increasing complex specific

5510.28 --> 5516.8
functions start to to pop

5513.159 --> 5521.44
up because of random things just

5516.8 --> 5526.159000000001
occurring that doesn't work either

5521.44 --> 5529.44
yeah starts with the design and then

5526.159 --> 5532.48
entropy dilutes and breaks down the

5529.44 --> 5532.48
design and that's

5538.119 --> 5543.679

not heard any of the arguments or when

5663.159 --> 5668.0
he did he didn't pay any attention so

nothing sunk

5668.0 --> 5675.52
in he didn't catch on to reality at all

5789.84 --> 5795.360000000001
sphere-shaped air that thing that

5791.96 --> 5797.96
doesn't exist and never happens CU air

5795.36 --> 5800.32
takes the shape of its container it

5797.96 --> 5802.92
doesn't take the shape of a sphere

5800.32 --> 5806.36
ever

5802.92 --> 5810.28
without the container being sphere

5806.36 --> 5813.28
shaped in order to cause it to become

5810.28 --> 5813.28
spherical

5813.36 --> 5819.32
around us yeah oh around presupposed

5816.639 --> 5823.159000000001
sphere earth that is in the sphere and

5819.32 --> 5823.159
the Horizon is not geometric it's

5823.679 --> 5831.4800000000005
flat yeah air is not sphere

5826.719 --> 5835.52
shaped it takes the shape of the

5831.48 --> 5838.04
container yeah the available

5835.52 --> 5840.88
volume that's what it takes the shape of

5838.04 --> 5843.48
not a sphere there's no demonstration of

5840.88 --> 5846.679
air taking up the shape of a sphere

5843.48 --> 5850.4
under any circumstances other than the

5846.679 --> 5850.4
container it is in being

5860.719 --> 5865.76
spherical it takes the shape of a

5863.0 --> 5867.76
pressure graded in our no it doesn't the

5865.76 --> 5870.679
pressure gradient is another influence

5867.76 --> 5873.96
dummy yeah secondary gradiation

5870.679 --> 5877.92
secondary it is temperature based yeah

5873.96 --> 5881.4800000000005
there's heat ground level there's cold

5877.92 --> 5883.96
up there when you have a closed system

5881.48 --> 5886.5199999999995
with air and there's a heat influence on

5883.96 --> 5890.44
one side and cold influence on the other

5886.52 --> 5893.400000000001
side it naturally forms a gradient

5890.44 --> 5896.0
within the closed system and this is

5893.4 --> 5896.0
physically

5900.119 --> 5903.119
demonstrated

5908.28 --> 5913.84
yeah besides you can't have a gas

5911.4 --> 5916.598999999999
pressure gradient without gas pressure

5913.84 --> 5918.2390000000005
and you can't have gas pressure without

5916.599 --> 5920.119000000001
container

5918.239 --> 5925.32
walls a

5920.119 --> 5927.96
container to make it press it needs the

5925.32 --> 5930.119
walls of the container to press upon to

5927.96 --> 5933.119
establish the

5930.119 --> 5933.119
pressure

5933.159 --> 5937.839999999999
to

5934.32 --> 5941.32
press otherwise it's just going to keep

5937.84 --> 5943.679
thinning up spreading out until there's

5941.32 --> 5946.159
nothing left to press it's all spread

5943.679 --> 5949.84
out so much it's gone all the air is

5946.159 --> 5953.679
gone yeah well the Earth has supposedly

5949.84 --> 5957.56
outer space right there with no barrier

5953.679 --> 5959.8
to separate the

5957.56 --> 5964.719
atmosphere from outer

5959.8 --> 5966.320000000001

atmosphere

5966.32 --> 5972.0
not exploding instantaneously in all

5969.599 --> 5974.4800000000005
