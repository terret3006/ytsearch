93.72 --> 99.84
well it looks really nice now but I mean

96.74 --> 102.56
an hour earlier it was raining really

99.84 --> 102.56
hard here

104.36 --> 107.72
so yeah

108.299 --> 111.68
there's been a lot of rain

112.68 --> 118.5
is rain pretty hard too but also just

115.619 --> 121.22
spots of really nice blue

118.5 --> 121.22
calm

121.619 --> 125.54
it's still warm

125.88 --> 131.819
right and yeah I mean the weather has

128.64 --> 134.22
really greened up the grass like I can

131.819 --> 136.92
very much notice it now

134.22 --> 138.78
just that it really has become a lot

136.92 --> 142.16
greener

138.78 --> 142.16
in the last two days

143.34 --> 147.98
right so the plants are definitely

145.08 --> 147.98000000000002
enjoying this weather

148.2 --> 155.819
nice and warm sunny and raining

153.18 --> 158.52
they love it

155.819 --> 160.819
The Parsley is doing great

158.52 --> 160.81900000000002
foreign

161.66 --> 166.68
a lot

163.68 --> 168.9
since it's like you I have to pour like

166.68 --> 171.239
three times the amount of water in that

168.9 --> 175.09900000000002
thing compared to all the other plants

171.239 --> 175.09900000000002
it sucks it up so much

176.879 --> 180.319
all right but it's doing great

192.18 --> 200.04000000000002
right so it is Thursday the 13th of July

197.04 --> 200.04
2023

202.099 --> 208.73899999999998
nobody in just yet

206.099 --> 212.06
I did start on time

208.739 --> 212.06
exactly on time

212.4 --> 218.22
right anyway

215.22 --> 221.22
I'm doing great I'm fully stocked I got

218.22 --> 221.22
rookola

221.819 --> 224.599
gusto

225.08 --> 231.959
and an Illuminati Castle

229.519 --> 233.81900000000002
although I've been feeling very weird

231.959 --> 237.26
and I don't know what it is going

233.819 --> 237.26
through another cycle or something

237.299 --> 241.14000000000001
so I'm not super hungry which is kind of

239.4 --> 243.08
weird because I did not really eat all

241.14 --> 247.51899999999998
that much yesterday

243.08 --> 247.519
but I mean I didn't like eating nothing

248.94 --> 254.04
it might be like the abrupt weather

251.04 --> 256.079
change like from really sunny to like a

254.04 --> 258.239
lot of rain all of a sudden

256.079 --> 259.62
moist levels probably are changing

258.239 --> 261.84
around

259.62 --> 264.419
I don't know

261.84 --> 267.35999999999996
anyway hello borders boy first to chat

264.419 --> 270.35999999999996
it's you

267.36 --> 270.36
uh

270.6 --> 276.24
[ __ ] the temperature and it's probably

274.199 --> 279.06
20 or something

276.24 --> 283.04
maybe less maybe 17

279.06 --> 283.04
ah it's 21 right

284.04 --> 288.96000000000004
and yeah with lots of rain seems like

286.56 --> 292.4
it's gonna be like that

288.96 --> 292.4
over the weekend as well

295.259 --> 302.90000000000003
yeah

296.34 --> 302.9
but still hang around 24 26 22

303.06 --> 306.02
so yeah

307.02 --> 311.59999999999997
I'll go to that

309.0 --> 316.199
hello Richard G good to see you

311.6 --> 318.68
plinio three four five hello

316.199 --> 318.68
welcome

320.58 --> 323.65999999999997
I think I know you

326.16 --> 329.96000000000004
should you actually have a channel

331.8 --> 335.6
see you're into cards a lot

340.86 --> 345.539
huh

342.539 --> 345.539
right

348.12 --> 353.58
oh there's a big cloud coming again you

351.6 --> 355.259
can just yeah rain coming out of it

353.58 --> 357.12
already

355.259 --> 359.699
so it is kind of that type of weather

357.12 --> 361.8
like kind of nice fluffy clouds and then

359.699 --> 364.16
like really big clouds come flying over

361.8 --> 364.16
and

364.199 --> 367.34000000000003
it starts raining

369.84 --> 374.00899999999996
see

370.79 --> 374.009
[Music]

374.039 --> 378.12
like

376.08 --> 381.8
now the fluffy clouds in the back and

378.12 --> 381.8
then this comes flying over

383.819 --> 387.96000000000004
all right long following

386.28 --> 390.85999999999996
okay

387.96 --> 390.85999999999996
since when

391.38 --> 396.24
I mean what is long

393.36 --> 399.139
since 2016.

396.24 --> 399.139
now that's long

400.259 --> 404.039
but I guess if you've been following me

402.18 --> 407.6
for like three years that's probably

404.039 --> 407.59999999999997
already pretty long to you

408.24 --> 411.979
two years right right

413.94 --> 418.819
well then at least you got to see the

416.039 --> 418.81899999999996
better part of me

421.44 --> 426.66
because in the last few years especially

424.8 --> 428.759
this last year I feel a lot more

426.66 --> 432.53900000000004
comfortable

428.759 --> 434.22
and I have a lot better control over my

432.539 --> 436.199
emotional outbursts when they happen

434.22 --> 438.0
because they still happen because it's

436.199 --> 440.699
part of me

438.0 --> 442.86
part of how I deal with my energies

440.699 --> 444.0
sometimes I need to do that or otherwise

442.86 --> 446.759
it

444.0 --> 449.28
it goes Inward and then I become really

446.759 --> 451.88
sick from it

449.28 --> 451.88
right

453.84 --> 456.96
but you've definitely seen the better

455.58 --> 460.28
part

456.96 --> 460.28
low Walking Man

469.02 --> 471.68
hmm

480.24 --> 484.5
I don't know you guys but I guess that

482.94 --> 488.479
you guys have been angry I don't know

484.5 --> 488.479
you all feel welcome now coming out

490.62 --> 495.18
anyway yesterday was the

493.02 --> 497.52
yeah no flat Earth debates which is

495.18 --> 499.62
really disappointing in a way but I mean

497.52 --> 500.87899999999996
Nathan is like putting his computer back

499.62 --> 503.34000000000003
together so

500.879 --> 505.86
I don't know maybe today

503.34 --> 508.979
there will be a show I don't know but

505.86 --> 511.08000000000004
I'll keep you updated

508.979 --> 513.8389999999999
during a live show

511.08 --> 516.38
if I hear anything hey slow mo buggy

513.839 --> 516.3800000000001
good to see you

519.12 --> 523.68
right

521.52 --> 525.12
it was kind of fun yesterday over at

523.68 --> 528.2399999999999
flatzoid

525.12 --> 530.519
popped up for business and it's like a

528.24 --> 534.36
whole chore to just say hello to people

530.519 --> 536.339
but I mean it's great I like that it's

534.36 --> 538.5600000000001
like walking into a pub

536.339 --> 542.36
you have to spend like at least five

538.56 --> 542.3599999999999
minutes just to say hello to everybody

542.94 --> 547.8800000000001
when they'll know you that's I don't

545.339 --> 547.8800000000001
know it's fun

551.279 --> 555.42
also that freaking Charlie Welch I

553.68 --> 558.5999999999999
blocked him again

555.42 --> 563.2199999999999
I had unblocked everybody just because I

558.6 --> 565.9200000000001
unblocked right and deleted everybody

563.22 --> 570.38
and blocked him too but I mean he that

565.92 --> 570.38
guy freaking stalks me everywhere

570.779 --> 578.82
he started yapping [ __ ] in freaking

575.459 --> 581.04
Dr shivas chat

578.82 --> 583.399
like what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you

581.04 --> 583.399
dick

583.44 --> 589.86
he really is a stalker guys you just

586.98 --> 593.519
Wherever I Go

589.86 --> 596.94
in live stream chats he always follows

593.519 --> 599.279
me around like all the weights every

596.94 --> 602.1
[ __ ] time I go somewhere

599.279 --> 604.8
he gets in there starts whining about me

602.1 --> 608.3000000000001
and starts talking to me like

604.8 --> 608.3
[ __ ] off

612.6 --> 617.58
yeah really

615.54 --> 619.68
I mean I mean that's been happening for

617.58 --> 621.48
for like a couple of years now and I

619.68 --> 624.92
hadn't blocked most of the time super

621.48 --> 624.9200000000001
fat I don't give a [ __ ]

625.68 --> 630.38
he's really really annoying

630.6 --> 634.8000000000001
and and dumb and lame he's just

633.18 --> 637.88
everything that sucks and it doesn't

634.8 --> 637.88
want to get away from me

638.36 --> 642.98
it's very [ __ ] annoying

646.68 --> 651.8389999999999
like and he's not really a fan either

648.959 --> 654.18
because he is he's always trying to rile

651.839 --> 657.48
people up against me

654.18 --> 661.8199999999999
it was lit he was seriously whining

657.48 --> 661.82
about the gay glasses show

661.86 --> 667.0790000000001
like like he didn't realize it wasn't

664.68 --> 669.7199999999999
just a joke I mean seriously you you

667.079 --> 672.9799999999999
think that that was all

669.72 --> 672.98
super literal

678.0 --> 683.0
I mean did anybody here

680.7 --> 687.36
Richard G you were there right

683.0 --> 689.519
did you guys really think that

687.36 --> 692.5790000000001
that I genuinely thought that if you

689.519 --> 696.32
wear glasses that per default makes you

692.579 --> 696.3199999999999
gay that that's literal

704.82 --> 710.279
that was only a bit of fun that's right

706.74 --> 712.38
yeah because I mean even you Moxie are

710.279 --> 714.06
not that [ __ ] [ __ ] like Charlie

712.38 --> 717.36
Welch

714.06 --> 718.6199999999999
who must be genuinely [ __ ] in a bad

717.36 --> 725.0
way

718.62 --> 725.0
not in the innocent and young Spirit way

726.12 --> 731.6
it's not naivety it's just genuine

728.94 --> 731.6
stupidity

734.3 --> 740.04
damage definitely why no slow I know he

737.76 --> 741.72
is damaged someone I can feel it often

740.04 --> 744.66
he is damaged

741.72 --> 748.62
but he needs to get the [ __ ] away from

744.66 --> 751.74
me or like seriously start fixing

748.62 --> 753.779
himself because if he's get if he gets

751.74 --> 757.019
all this [ __ ] demon [ __ ] in him under

753.779 --> 759.42
control and he starts to approach me

757.019 --> 761.64
like an actual person that might be able

759.42 --> 764.6999999999999
to help him because I I'm sure that I am

761.64 --> 767.16
but not while he acts like this

764.7 --> 769.5600000000001
well then I would actually let him back

767.16 --> 772.4399999999999
in my streams and all that [ __ ]

769.56 --> 775.3199999999999
and basically work on it

772.44 --> 778.86
like I have with so many people

775.32 --> 783.74
like I have with Akuma virus

778.86 --> 783.74
like to a degree I have with you moxie

784.8 --> 789.7199999999999
right

786.54 --> 792.0
but that takes some slapping around

789.72 --> 794.1600000000001
before you get it and before you start

792.0 --> 797.22
to fall in line that you realize like no

794.16 --> 800.04
no it's not attacked you really have to

797.22 --> 802.26
it's not a tag team game you really have

800.04 --> 806.12
to adapt

802.26 --> 806.12
or you're not getting in my show

806.639 --> 810.6
and I I don't know if Charlie Wells can

808.98 --> 813.839
actually do that

810.6 --> 815.22
I know that he he would require a lot of

813.839 --> 818.5790000000001
patience because

815.22 --> 821.94
I have very little patience for him and

818.579 --> 825.12
he's tried to act nice before and then

821.94 --> 827.399
went on complete gamma spazz bits after

825.12 --> 830.339
that so

827.399 --> 832.2
it's gonna take a lot

830.339 --> 834.36
and besides I haven't blocked now anyway

832.2 --> 837.62
so

834.36 --> 837.62
hey Dan good to see you

838.26 --> 844.279
right

840.42 --> 844.279
so that uh

844.32 --> 851.779
Owen Benjamin expanded more

848.22 --> 851.779
on his conception

852.48 --> 858.899
about the sex trafficking

856.38 --> 861.0
movie thing

858.899 --> 862.82
I forgot the name

861.0 --> 865.44
but uh

862.82 --> 867.5400000000001
it is weird man

865.44 --> 870.24
and I think that he makes a good point

867.54 --> 871.56
it does seem like it is kind of like a a

870.24 --> 874.38
right

871.56 --> 876.6199999999999
controlled right-wing operation type

874.38 --> 876.62
thing

877.5 --> 880.86
I don't know anyway I didn't like watch

879.36 --> 883.98
the movie

880.86 --> 886.86
I'm not I didn't plan to I I know what

883.98 --> 889.38
it's about and I know like a roughly

886.86 --> 891.3000000000001
yeah I've seen a trailer and that's it I

889.38 --> 893.6
don't need to know more I don't want to

891.3 --> 893.5999999999999
know more

893.76 --> 899.04
because I'm not a morbidly curious

897.0 --> 900.72
sadist

899.04 --> 905.519
like

900.72 --> 907.139
like morbid morbidly curious sadist in

905.519 --> 909.6
denial I think that pretty much

907.139 --> 912.26
summarizes the right wing these days

909.6 --> 912.26
doesn't it

912.5 --> 917.959
morbidly curious

915.0 --> 917.959
in denial

927.36 --> 934.5
it's cold right yeah yeah

930.899 --> 937.74
that is what it is called yes

934.5 --> 941.339
but I mean it is very overhyped I even

937.74 --> 943.139
like when it was still not yet out I

941.339 --> 944.4590000000001
even like spread a trailer about it

943.139 --> 945.9590000000001
because I thought like yeah there's

944.459 --> 949.459
probably a whole bunch of people that

945.959 --> 949.459
are going to be really into this

953.04 --> 958.4399999999999
but uh yeah myself no I don't really

956.82 --> 961.139
care all that much

958.44 --> 962.94
I mean I do care about the actual sex

961.139 --> 966.899
trafficking but I mean

962.94 --> 969.0600000000001
the movie it just seems weird

966.899 --> 971.779
like posturing

969.06 --> 971.779
in a way

974.22 --> 977.4200000000001
to offend your face

980.04 --> 985.079
all right anyway shout out to skeptic

982.98 --> 987.5600000000001
we're still recovering from his leg

985.079 --> 987.56
injury

987.779 --> 991.5
he sent me a PayPal with the message

989.579 --> 994.56
that he's aboard in his wheelchair and

991.5 --> 998.699
checking the early bird show

994.56 --> 1001.42
so yeah I hope for speedy recovery

998.699 --> 1001.42
skeptic

1002.839 --> 1011.0
get a little work floor accident like

1006.019 --> 1012.86
hurt his leg pretty heavily but no I

1011.0 --> 1017.44
don't think he had any very lasting

1012.86 --> 1017.44
damage or something so hey that's this

1024.599 --> 1027.6789999999999
[Music]

1034.4 --> 1039.2800000000002
what's going on

1036.14 --> 1039.2800000000002
are we still alive

1043.64 --> 1050.48
wow my YouTube had a hard stall I had to

1047.959 --> 1055.52
reset the internet but

1050.48 --> 1058.039
did skeptic find any gold uh well

1055.52 --> 1060.22
I don't think he yeah he said 11 cents

1058.039 --> 1060.22
worth

1065.48 --> 1070.4
I think skeptic's mostly doing it for

1067.58 --> 1073.6399999999999
the fun of it and maybe get lucky with

1070.4 --> 1076.299
the big score one time or something

1073.64 --> 1076.2990000000002
hmm

1102.679 --> 1106.24
okay walking man I

1110.059 --> 1115.059
what that's a very inappropriate thing

1112.64 --> 1115.0590000000002
to say

1120.86 --> 1123.86

1132.919 --> 1136.1200000000001
thanks for sharing

1149.08 --> 1156.1599999999999
did he get a metal detect he does seem

1152.299 --> 1156.16
to use a metal detector I think

1159.02 --> 1163.7
you want one

1161.84 --> 1166.12
yeah metal detector could be pretty cool

1163.7 --> 1166.1200000000001
I have

1189.14 --> 1193.8200000000002
right so yeah I don't really have a

1191.66 --> 1196.78
subject that they're ready to talk about

1193.82 --> 1196.78
kind of like yesterday

1202.52 --> 1206.3799999999999
a metal slugs cockatiel

1218.72 --> 1224.299
I mean it's mostly just spending the

1221.299 --> 1226.22
time in nature at a river

1224.299 --> 1227.4189999999999
so yeah it's great

1226.22 --> 1229.52
[Music]

1227.419 --> 1232.179
it's it's like a picnic with some

1229.52 --> 1232.179
fooling around

1235.34 --> 1240.62
I mean I'd love to do it one time like

1237.5 --> 1244.58
get a a baguette

1240.62 --> 1247.84
with like salami and all that with me

1244.58 --> 1247.84
that's a great lunch

1247.94 --> 1253.0
and then do that stuff that I mean that

1250.46 --> 1253.0
sounds great

1257.539 --> 1264.679
like that or basically

1261.34 --> 1268.4189999999999
chopping in the wall to find gems that

1264.679 --> 1268.419
that would be equally awesome to me

1274.82 --> 1279.6789999999999
let's have the lights

1277.179 --> 1282.0800000000002
detectable and so yeah it's not

1279.679 --> 1283.88
satellites but what they do is they have

1282.08 --> 1286.1
a technique now

1283.88 --> 1288.7990000000002
I even noticed that in my vision that

1286.1 --> 1291.86
they had a way to just

1288.799 --> 1293.12
through resonance find material it's

1291.86 --> 1294.62
like they

1293.12 --> 1297.3799999999999
it's

1294.62 --> 1300.3799999999999
very roughly described like they

1297.38 --> 1303.0800000000002
basically send a signal

1300.38 --> 1305.9
of a very specific frequency that's like

1303.08 --> 1308.12
human resonance exactly attuned to a

1305.9 --> 1310.6000000000001
very specific type of material

1308.12 --> 1313.82
and then they can like

1310.6 --> 1316.3999999999999
extrapolate where it is

1313.82 --> 1318.86
for as far as it could reach and that

1316.4 --> 1321.5
stuff apparently even can go

1318.86 --> 1324.58
subterranean

1321.5 --> 1324.58
so it's like

1325.7 --> 1329.299
way more advanced than p waves and S

1328.34 --> 1331.8799999999999
waves

1329.299 --> 1334.58
that type of thing

1331.88 --> 1338.38
you could just like detect material

1334.58 --> 1338.3799999999999
based on the Resonance of it

1340.1 --> 1349.8799999999999
I I experienced that in the dark world

1344.679 --> 1352.22
is part of a a more serious like a

1349.88 --> 1354.74
it was like I was in this weird

1352.22 --> 1359.059
holographic

1354.74 --> 1361.88
did you know library or Laboratory

1359.059 --> 1366.039
with like multiple screens and weird

1361.88 --> 1366.0390000000002
keyboards that were all highlighted

1369.98 --> 1378.34
and it was dealing with information

1373.48 --> 1378.34
including like scanning information so

1378.62 --> 1385.4599999999998
yeah oh by the way the the display when

1382.88 --> 1388.2800000000002
giving readout as to materials in

1385.46 --> 1390.82
locations in the earth you know what the

1388.28 --> 1393.28
display displayed it like

1390.82 --> 1395.0
a like

1393.28 --> 1397.94
CGI

1395.0 --> 1402.559
platform of the Earth

1397.94 --> 1404.1200000000001
a big square that was like as 3D shown

1402.559 --> 1406.58
like this right

1404.12 --> 1410.0
from diagonally above

1406.58 --> 1414.039
but yeah flat so even in my Dark World

1410.0 --> 1414.039
simulation it was all flat

1416.24 --> 1419.44
and squares

1425.12 --> 1431.4189999999999
is Earth Square now well I wouldn't know

1428.36 --> 1434.6789999999999
this was before I realized the Earth was

1431.419 --> 1437.24
flat for real like before I

1434.679 --> 1439.8200000000002
decompartmentalize that from my Global

1437.24 --> 1441.799
Earth's belief

1439.82 --> 1443.48
I got to see all these things when

1441.799 --> 1445.4
you're a globe believer you get to see

1443.48 --> 1447.5
all kinds of indications that the Earth

1445.4 --> 1449.24
is flat you just don't pick up on them

1447.5 --> 1451.72
you just don't realize that that is what

1449.24 --> 1451.72
you're seeing

1452.9 --> 1457.22
all right

1455.299 --> 1459.559
although there were moments where it was

1457.22 --> 1462.159
much more overt and like

1459.559 --> 1466.28
showed me an actual

1462.159 --> 1468.3200000000002
telegraphed depiction of a

1466.28 --> 1470.539
Square Earth

1468.32 --> 1473.24
with like a

1470.539 --> 1476.08
star Demi sphere

1473.24 --> 1476.08
over it

1476.78 --> 1479.5
foreign

1483.559 --> 1491.2
I think that that was like shown to me

1486.58 --> 1491.1999999999998
pre-holographic realization of the Stars

1492.52 --> 1495.75
[Music]

1499.4 --> 1504.3400000000001
oh god oh we got some squirt Boys in

1502.159 --> 1504.3400000000001
here

1504.559 --> 1511.6399999999999
give me your perspective

1507.7 --> 1512.539
yes yes except the entire surface of

1511.64 --> 1515.179
Earth

1512.539 --> 1517.039
everything of it

1515.179 --> 1520.1000000000001
was displayed

1517.039 --> 1525.5
in a single Square

1520.1 --> 1528.1399999999999
yeah it had heights yeah the map could

1525.5 --> 1531.039
rotate

1528.14 --> 1534.14
to even horizontal to have height only

1531.039 --> 1535.1
and it would be like a flat line with

1534.14 --> 1537.6200000000001
like

1535.1 --> 1540.1399999999999
lights coloring the materials being

1537.62 --> 1543.58
highlighted underneath it yeah yeah so

1540.14 --> 1543.5800000000002
it was like a 3D model

1547.279 --> 1553.279
it's a flat surface in what seemed to be

1550.4 --> 1557.5
a square box

1553.279 --> 1562.539
that's how it looked in that

1557.5 --> 1562.539
Dark World Vision simulation thing

1566.84 --> 1571.039
I I don't even think that that

1568.64 --> 1572.72
information was actually from inside my

1571.039 --> 1575.779
own brain

1572.72 --> 1577.88
I think that was external

1575.779 --> 1580.64
because it had to do with involvement

1577.88 --> 1584.48
with other groups

1580.64 --> 1587.3200000000002
like I got busy on the other side guys I

1584.48 --> 1587.32
got busy

1596.24 --> 1599.02
thank you

1602.059 --> 1607.34
eager to see what simulation thing you

1604.94 --> 1612.679
reference referencing

1607.34 --> 1614.84
what yeah sorry dude you can't

1612.679 --> 1618.38
you're not gonna because that was

1614.84 --> 1622.8799999999999
literally not in the physical world

1618.38 --> 1624.6200000000001
it was a Holodeck simulation in my Dark

1622.88 --> 1627.5800000000002
World Vision

1624.62 --> 1630.32
it's an outer body experience like thing

1627.58 --> 1632.8999999999999
not in the Physical Realm so you don't

1630.32 --> 1634.9399999999998
float above you but you go through to

1632.9 --> 1636.38
another place where technically there's

1634.94 --> 1641.24
only dark

1636.38 --> 1644.1200000000001
and the energy that you unleash

1641.24 --> 1646.88
and you can make holodex with that and

1644.12 --> 1650.799
there's other entities too that can also

1646.88 --> 1650.7990000000002
use your energy to do things

1665.779 --> 1668.38
her in a while

1669.44 --> 1675.3400000000001
a little more recent times she's mostly

1671.6 --> 1675.34
been echoing ether stuff

1680.36 --> 1683.74
maybe she got bored

1686.659 --> 1690.46
you need shrooms no

1693.679 --> 1697.72
you don't just get to see it

1702.74 --> 1707.6
I mean you could attempt to start seeing

1706.4 --> 1711.74
it

1707.6 --> 1714.62
but you'd literally be risking your life

1711.74 --> 1719.74
just to get a glimpse like that

1714.62 --> 1719.7399999999998
like I literally risked my life

1720.62 --> 1727.1
and my soul

1723.26 --> 1729.919
to to do those things

1727.1 --> 1732.6789999999999
yeah don't recommend I'm here to be able

1729.919 --> 1734.2990000000002
to tell you some of that experience so

1732.679 --> 1739.3600000000001
you don't have to

1734.299 --> 1739.36
because I really don't recommend it yeah

1739.88 --> 1746.6200000000001
the majority of that experience was

1743.059 --> 1746.62
literally hellish

horrendous details and facts

1759.44 --> 1765.7

1762.679 --> 1765.7
they thought it was

the hell's going on here did you well go

you stupid drug addict idiot

you really want to know go to a Satanist

1811.52 --> 1816.039
sell your [ __ ] soul and tell them you

1813.32 --> 1816.039
want to meet God

good luck with that let's see what's

1821.299 --> 1824.559
left of you after that

1829.88 --> 1836.0800000000002
you don't want to know

1832.1 --> 1836.08
just listen to what I got to say

1837.26 --> 1842.98
it's like the least I can get out of it

1844.159 --> 1849.0390000000002

no the conversation is not about Flat

1875.6 --> 1881.899
Earth other than that I saw it's flat

1879.26 --> 1883.94
that literally everything that I've ever

1881.899 --> 1887.299
experienced included in the Dark World

1883.94 --> 1892.1200000000001
Visions and talking with the Architects

1887.299 --> 1892.12
and talking with the higher Mages

1893.059 --> 1896.299
their spirits

1894.74 --> 1899.1200000000001
because I don't think those were

1896.299 --> 1902.0
actually living anymore

1899.12 --> 1904.1
that all of it is flat all of it they

1902.0 --> 1905.899
know it's flat

1904.1 --> 1908.36
and

1905.899 --> 1910.6999999999998
the globe belief is like for our

1908.36 --> 1912.74
protection

1910.7 --> 1915.2
the globe belief

1912.74 --> 1916.64
is for those who can't handle the truth

1915.2 --> 1920.5
because

1916.64 --> 1920.5
if you can't believe in a globe then

1921.98 --> 1927.679
you can believe in anything you can also

1924.44 --> 1929.8400000000001
very much be capable of disbelieving the

1927.679 --> 1932.44
real dark things that also happen in

1969.2 --> 1974.779
the exact nature the details of the

nature of the substance that I

1974.779 --> 1979.52
originally got fed without knowing what

1978.08 --> 1982.76
it was

1979.52 --> 1984.9189999999999
that induced that I wouldn't [ __ ]

1982.76 --> 1988.64
tell you

1984.919 --> 1991.1000000000001

you want to see something amazing try

1991.1 --> 1995.24
Russian Roulette you get a real kick out

avoid fluoride fluoridated toothpaste

through your dreams enter the Dark World

2041.019 --> 2046.299
all by yourself without

2043.899 --> 2048.52
having freaking demons [ __ ] with you

2046.299 --> 2050.44
while you do it

2048.52 --> 2053.2599999999998
although if you're just gonna [ __ ]

2050.44 --> 2056.04
around and sin and not realize sin and

2053.26 --> 2058.48
like don't realize the order of

2056.04 --> 2060.82
existence because you don't believe in

2058.48 --> 2063.22
God yeah the demons will [ __ ] come to

2060.82 --> 2065.5
you yeah

2063.22 --> 2068.379
they smell weakness

2065.5 --> 2070.119
at infinite distance because there is no

2068.379 --> 2072.46
distance in the Dark World

2070.119 --> 2074.56
so good luck with that

2072.46 --> 2076.96
you know oh I got the point yeah but

2074.56 --> 2078.22
you're an atheist so yeah good luck for

2076.96 --> 2081.48
that dude

2078.22 --> 2081.48
they will come for you

2082.0 --> 2085.2
I promise you that

2088.139 --> 2092.58
dark world is not a safe place

2105.52 --> 2109.48
you need to play yeah no no don't do

2107.92 --> 2112.78
that Aries

2109.48 --> 2116.4
[ __ ] is wrong with you stop

2112.78 --> 2116.4
stop making this worse

2120.339 --> 2125.88
harass you all the time you deal with

2122.56 --> 2125.88
them fine wow

2128.02 --> 2134.52
so you think you're doing a good job

2132.339 --> 2138.46
because you're doing fine

2134.52 --> 2141.46
despite demons harassing you

2138.46 --> 2141.46
okay

2143.8 --> 2150.6600000000003
well if you were actually doing just

2146.2 --> 2150.66
fine then the demons wouldn't harass you

2155.38 --> 2159.54
yeah demons only go for weakness

2160.119 --> 2165.96
attack you they think they can get

2162.22 --> 2165.9599999999996
somewhere because you're weak

2175.06 --> 2178.7999999999997
you can't harass demons

2185.32 --> 2188.52
doesn't work like that

2191.32 --> 2195.119
how do you get spiritually strong

2196.119 --> 2203.52
go through a lot of torture in life

2200.079 --> 2203.52
without breaking

2207.7 --> 2214.4199999999996
that's pretty much it

2209.98 --> 2217.06
but yeah I mean

2214.42 --> 2219.4
looking at your behavior I can see that

2217.06 --> 2222.18
you definitely did not go through it

2219.4 --> 2222.1800000000003
unscathed

2226.9 --> 2232.54
yeah because if you go through torture

2228.7 --> 2236.5
and you break and you buckle

2232.54 --> 2240.4
and you flip around to the other side

2236.5 --> 2243.22
because it's too much yeah

2240.4 --> 2247.2400000000002
that's

2243.22 --> 2248.68
that's how demons get a grip on you

2247.24 --> 2251.7999999999997
and

2248.68 --> 2253.18
even if you did that by accident or yeah

2251.8 --> 2255.1600000000003
you were too weak and there's nothing

2253.18 --> 2256.72
you could do about it or whatever from

2255.16 --> 2259.66
the outside

2256.72 --> 2262.66
it's still going to leave a mark on you

2259.66 --> 2265.48
think of Frodo's wound

2262.66 --> 2267.5789999999997
from the morgo blade that it can

2265.48 --> 2271.8
potentially stay with you the rest of

2267.579 --> 2271.8
your life as it has with me

2285.24 --> 2291.2799999999997
but I mean yeah demons they can't really

2288.94 --> 2293.7400000000002
harass me they try all the time

2291.28 --> 2295.2400000000002
but it doesn't work because I'm way too

2293.74 --> 2298.0
conscious of it

2295.24 --> 2301.2999999999997
and I got techniques

2298.0 --> 2304.02
and I got just

2301.3 --> 2307.48
I'm I'm too equipped

2304.02 --> 2309.4
they they really can't get me they can

2307.48 --> 2312.839
get me to a certainly they can shock me

2309.4 --> 2312.839
that's about it

2314.619 --> 2317.98
and it's not gonna come through any

2316.18 --> 2320.74
person by the way

2317.98 --> 2322.839
so don't flatter yourself thinking that

2320.74 --> 2325.9799999999996
you're the one that does that

2322.839 --> 2325.98
whoever's out there

2335.98 --> 2341.52
never seen it you don't see demons

2348.96 --> 2356.68
you might see hallucinations or whatever

2353.02 --> 2359.74
or dreams that are indirect

2356.68 --> 2362.74
results of demon interactions but just

2359.74 --> 2364.859
don't see demons

2362.74 --> 2364.859
thank you

2367.119 --> 2370.2000000000003
they're not physical

2372.46 --> 2377.92
like extra dimensional

2375.339 --> 2380.7
and they are entangled with us like they

2377.92 --> 2380.7000000000003
are destined

2381.579 --> 2387.76
to deal with us and we have to deal with

2385.42 --> 2390.48
them it's part of the reason for

2387.76 --> 2390.48
existence

2395.32 --> 2400.599
like the Garden of Eden is like

2397.3 --> 2402.76
continual it's always happening always

2400.599 --> 2405.119
it's like a Timeless thing that always

2402.76 --> 2405.119
happens

2408.94 --> 2411.94
foreign

2423.54 --> 2429.099
yeah if you're strong

2426.52 --> 2430.54
then they'll go for those around you

2429.099 --> 2431.619
that are weak

2430.54 --> 2434.14
like

2431.619 --> 2438.06
if you hang with a strong person you're

2434.14 --> 2438.06
gonna get the attacks

2438.22 --> 2443.3199999999997
yeah

2439.68 --> 2446.5
to see if you're worthy

2443.32 --> 2448.78
to associate with the strong person or

2446.5 --> 2451.5
if you're weak and easily peer pressured

2448.78 --> 2451.5
and intimidated

2465.579 --> 2471.7000000000003
that's hilarious walking man but I mean

2467.98 --> 2474.96
it's not that kind I'm not talking about

2471.7 --> 2474.96
physical creatures

2486.16 --> 2492.66
and you can bet your ass that demons

2488.38 --> 2492.6600000000003
very much bother people from Wales

2500.2 --> 2506.14
what do humans do

2503.7 --> 2509.2799999999997
demoralize you

2506.14 --> 2509.2799999999997
what they always do

2509.38 --> 2514.42
take away your energy take away your

2511.3 --> 2518.079
spunk take away your Peak spirit

2514.42 --> 2521.76
Take Your Enthusiasm or flip it around

2518.079 --> 2521.76
into dark enthusiasm

2523.48 --> 2528.339
just archetypes now they're an influence

2525.76 --> 2532.38
they're an influence they are actual

2528.339 --> 2532.38
entities non-human entities

2532.78 --> 2539.3390000000004
and they influence

2535.24 --> 2539.339
they carry a frequency

2540.76 --> 2546.1600000000003
by associating

2543.88 --> 2547.839
that frequency leeches on you and that's

2546.16 --> 2550.96
exactly what they want they would just

2547.839 --> 2555.66
want they just want to be friends

2550.96 --> 2555.66
really really [ __ ] up

2555.7 --> 2559.2599999999998
Super Evil friends

2564.21 --> 2567.329
[Music]

2569.02 --> 2573.4
not really though they're just one of

2571.72 --> 2574.4599999999996
mine control you because they don't

2573.4 --> 2575.98
really know friendship

2574.46 --> 2577.7200000000003
[Music]

2575.98 --> 2579.04
but that's what they will make it seem

2577.72 --> 2583.2599999999998
like

2579.04 --> 2583.2599999999998
the the real you in

2587.44 --> 2590.28
no

2591.64 --> 2596.22
no sorry Casey just know

2603.42 --> 2610.38
Spirits don't mate

2606.0 --> 2610.38
procreation is an Earthly concept

2611.91 --> 2616.7799999999997
[Music]

2614.619 --> 2619.3
yeah life

2616.78 --> 2621.2200000000003
procreation that's all material

2619.3 --> 2625.079
originated

2621.22 --> 2625.0789999999997
doesn't happen in the spirit Realm

2625.119 --> 2631.3
now eternity does not procreate

2628.839 --> 2635.7
it's illogical

2631.3 --> 2635.7000000000003
it's only the temporary that does

2656.74 --> 2662.819
you're a very unpleasant person Nemo I

2659.619 --> 2662.819
think we're just going to ban you

2663.52 --> 2665.64
thank you

2667.14 --> 2671.2799999999997
let's see what you say next

2701.69 --> 2706.649
[Music]

2708.52 --> 2714.64
yeah yeah dude why don't you get the

2712.06 --> 2717.24
[ __ ] out of here you [ __ ] atheist

2714.64 --> 2717.24
[ __ ]

2719.14 --> 2724.48
go play more video games that's probably

2721.359 --> 2727.359
what you do most of your life

2724.48 --> 2729.4
so much that you think that the game

2727.359 --> 2732.42
world is more real

2729.4 --> 2732.42
in reality

2734.79 --> 2738.16
[Music]

2736.3 --> 2741.04
yeah I [ __ ] know the difference

2738.16 --> 2743.7999999999997
between game world and reality

2741.04 --> 2747.3
and I've seen [ __ ] hell

2743.8 --> 2747.3
in reality

2749.319 --> 2756.839
as in not a conceptual world that I

2753.579 --> 2760.3590000000004
would have as a sub experience

2756.839 --> 2762.22
but as a first-hand experience as a

2760.359 --> 2765.119
spirit

2762.22 --> 2765.1189999999997
not fun

2765.28 --> 2770.1400000000003
I mean hell is a lot more entertaining

2767.619 --> 2772.7400000000002
in a computer than it is in the real

2770.14 --> 2772.74
when when

2772.78 --> 2776.619
you don't have a safe zoomed out

2774.88 --> 2780.06
perspective to it

2776.619 --> 2780.06
and you can just turn it off

2789.64 --> 2793.5
use a Minecraft I don't care

2798.339 --> 2805.2
useless

2801.22 --> 2805.2
useless conversation list

2806.64 --> 2812.02
yeah I'm not saying you don't you can't

2809.2 --> 2815.46
like Minecraft what I'm saying is he's a

2812.02 --> 2815.46
useless conversation list

2818.26 --> 2823.0600000000004
that somebody that never progressed

2820.48 --> 2827.02
Beyond like oh gaming with your buddies

2823.06 --> 2830.0789999999997
at 12 and talking [ __ ] obviously

2827.02 --> 2831.7
that's a person that never evolved

2830.079 --> 2835.48
beyond that

2831.7 --> 2838.06
so not my chat

2835.48 --> 2841.5
go back to playing Minecraft and talking

2838.06 --> 2841.5
[ __ ] on your own channel

2854.319 --> 2858.819
is a job now that's your experience here

2856.9 --> 2862.02
on America

2858.819 --> 2862.02
jmec level

2863.68 --> 2868.44
are you deleting your messages now huh

2865.96 --> 2868.44
goody

2871.06 --> 2875.099
anyway

2871.79 --> 2875.099
[Music]

2875.88 --> 2881.1600000000003
got cold I think I'm gonna have to put

2878.5 --> 2881.16
it in the oven

2883.3 --> 2887.1600000000003
I don't want to eat it cold

2890.38 --> 2893.38
ah

2895.66 --> 2898.87
[Music]

2947.04 --> 2951.339
right

2948.9 --> 2953.02
let's see if I can get this chat under

2951.339 --> 2955.859
control I got the feeling I have to ban

2953.02 --> 2955.859
a whole bunch of people

2956.079 --> 2960.78
but maybe it's not going to be that bad

2961.599 --> 2963.7200000000003
thank you

2984.3 --> 2990.1600000000003
Emma Thorne

2986.5 --> 2991.72
Vibes yeah now that was a straight on

2990.16 --> 2996.0
like

2991.72 --> 2996.0
freaky sjw person

2996.4 --> 3001.14
or the Reversed of that because I think

2999.099 --> 3003.48
there's a new thing coming

3001.14 --> 3005.5789999999997
I think there's gonna be like an sjw

3003.48 --> 3006.9
conservative

3005.579 --> 3009.3590000000004
type

3006.9 --> 3012.42
Bubble Up that's gonna be just as

3009.359 --> 3014.7
terrible as sjw

3012.42 --> 3017.76
except like

3014.7 --> 3021.1189999999997
a little less [ __ ] and much more

3017.76 --> 3025.7400000000002
like gross

3021.119 --> 3027.48
gross and arrogant and like exaggerated

3025.74 --> 3031.22
I think that's coming

3027.48 --> 3031.22
and she kind of looked like that

3035.16 --> 3039.319
what do I do for a living this show

3039.72 --> 3045.98
oh okay

3042.3 --> 3045.98
yeah you get the [ __ ] out

3057.24 --> 3064.319
yeah what I don't do for a living is

3059.52 --> 3067.92
play [ __ ] lame [ __ ] games

3064.319 --> 3070.74
that are really mind lovingly boring and

3067.92 --> 3072.599
repetitive and pointless because you

3070.74 --> 3075.0589999999997
don't learn anything

3072.599 --> 3077.599
other than how much the game sucks and

3075.059 --> 3081.1800000000003
then play it online while yapping about

3077.599 --> 3084.9
absolute horror [ __ ] contemporary

3081.18 --> 3088.9199999999996
political [ __ ] even to like the

3084.9 --> 3091.559
worst degree possible as in intellectual

3088.92 --> 3093.92
contribution yeah no I don't do that for

3091.559 --> 3093.92
a living

3094.319 --> 3097.819
there's a lot of people doing that for a

3096.54 --> 3101.16
living

3097.819 --> 3104.46
literally disintegrating the average

3101.16 --> 3107.46
World intellect as they do it

3104.46 --> 3110.18
and they'll throw money at them too you

3107.46 --> 3113.52
can get really well paid if you

3110.18 --> 3116.7599999999998
systematically turn everybody into a

3113.52 --> 3120.44
complete [ __ ] degenerate [ __ ] yeah

3116.76 --> 3120.44
you get paid a lot for that

3130.4 --> 3134.579
no I like to talk about things that

3133.14 --> 3137.5789999999997
actually matter

3134.579 --> 3141.6600000000003
that are actually interesting

3137.579 --> 3145.28
they're not what everybody else yaps on

3141.66 --> 3145.2799999999997
because of the newest thing

3147.0 --> 3149.72
oh

3161.94 --> 3168.119
oh yeah no but author Casey

3165.18 --> 3172.02
when you really push atheists

3168.119 --> 3173.94
they always end up saying that yes God

3172.02 --> 3176.42
does exist he just didn't create

3173.94 --> 3176.42
everything

3180.78 --> 3188.6400000000003
right in in the atheist expanded logic

3186.059 --> 3190.92
with heliocentrism included it's

3188.64 --> 3193.2599999999998
basically aliens that created us and

3190.92 --> 3197.339
then the aliens that created the aliens

3193.26 --> 3201.7200000000003
so in that they just see humans as being

3197.339 --> 3204.839
a chain in the link of God

3201.72 --> 3207.24
it's like every generation

3204.839 --> 3210.72
of being

3207.24 --> 3214.5589999999997
is like the God for the Next Generation

3210.72 --> 3218.18
like that's how they kind of see it

3214.559 --> 3218.1800000000003
ancient alien Theory

3240.78 --> 3246.13
is all the way down

3243.2 --> 3247.3799999999997
okay more colored

what's the talk I don't know where to

3271.74 --> 3276.4199999999996
just a whole bunch of new people

3273.18 --> 3280.02
generally in my chat and yeah already

3276.42 --> 3284.119
feel itching to kick them all out

3280.02 --> 3284.119
because I'm kind of xenophobic like that

3285.18 --> 3289.3799999999997
I don't like new people getting in my

3287.579 --> 3292.02
chat and suddenly feeling all super

3289.38 --> 3294.1400000000003
comfortable like making space for

3292.02 --> 3297.23
themselves like no no

[Music]

3300.78 --> 3305.78
you don't get to make room for yourself

3305.88 --> 3312.059
like that in my chat

3309.18 --> 3313.74
this is not like the typical chat of any

3312.059 --> 3317.28
other live stream where everybody just

3313.74 --> 3319.5589999999997
blabbers on on the side of whatever is

3317.28 --> 3322.02
happening in the live show now this is a

3319.559 --> 3324.42
very interactive chat it's very

3322.02 --> 3328.559
intricately tied in

3324.42 --> 3330.78
with the actual live show activity

3328.559 --> 3332.6400000000003
I read the chat a lot I respond to the

3330.78 --> 3335.52
chat I talk to the chat so I'm not

3332.64 --> 3338.96
having people just settle in like

3335.52 --> 3338.96
there's their new home or something

3339.0 --> 3343.859
new peoples would gross my channel yeah

3341.22 --> 3346.2
I don't give a [ __ ]

3343.859 --> 3348.7799999999997
I don't give a [ __ ] I don't need to grow

3346.2 --> 3355.339
my channel I I like to have

3348.78 --> 3355.3390000000004
cool interesting wise intelligent people

3357.72 --> 3363.68
and people that are eager to learn for

3360.66 --> 3363.68
the right reasons

3371.4 --> 3376.98
and I'm very very picky

3374.52 --> 3378.66
when it comes to girlfriends and when it

3376.98 --> 3381.599
comes to friends and people in general

3378.66 --> 3384.24
that I like to hang around so

3381.599 --> 3386.76
yeah this is never going to be some big

3384.24 --> 3388.9199999999996
booming chat with thousands of people

3386.76 --> 3390.7200000000003
that are just blabbering all over it's

3388.92 --> 3393.66
never going to be that because then I

3390.72 --> 3397.2599999999998
wouldn't really have a show

3393.66 --> 3400.7599999999998
I'd have to have a completely separate

3397.26 --> 3400.76
think the ride on

3409.98 --> 3413.22
um

3411.35 --> 3415.859
[Music]

3413.22 --> 3418.2599999999998
all the aliens that made the aliens made

3415.859 --> 3420.42
the aliens and then the aliens that made

3418.26 --> 3422.7200000000003
the aliens that made the aliens made the

3420.42 --> 3422.7200000000003
aliens

3424.74 --> 3427.64
so yeah

3431.46 --> 3436.26
but they do the same stupid thing with

3433.5 --> 3439.44
God too it's like but who made God

3436.26 --> 3441.3
yeah it all gives a [ __ ]

3439.44 --> 3442.92
what's making

3441.3 --> 3446.059
if it's

3442.92 --> 3449.52
if God literally created

3446.059 --> 3451.6800000000003
physicality itself

3449.52 --> 3455.52
then why would you assume that something

3451.68 --> 3459.8999999999996
would be making God

3455.52 --> 3464.819
perhaps the conception of making

3459.9 --> 3467.46
did not even exist before God made it so

3464.819 --> 3470.7
ever considered that

3467.46 --> 3473.46
that things as making

3470.7 --> 3478.98
coming into existence

3473.46 --> 3481.559
didn't really exist before creation

3478.98 --> 3483.66
then why would you ever try to argue

3481.559 --> 3485.52
what created God then yeah nothing

3483.66 --> 3487.02
because there was no such thing as

3485.52 --> 3490.339
creation

3487.02 --> 3490.339
everything just was

3490.68 --> 3493.8799999999997
or rather was not

3498.059 --> 3504.1800000000003
like you could say that before creation

3500.88 --> 3506.819
to even Define God as a being

3504.18 --> 3510.44
is like

3506.819 --> 3513.96
a physically assumption bias

3510.44 --> 3515.4
it's because we can't imagine

3513.96 --> 3518.96
something

3515.4 --> 3518.96
that's just always there

3522.059 --> 3524.599
anyway

[Music]

3532.38 --> 3538.559
it's crazy yeah yeah guys just the guy

3536.579 --> 3541.6800000000003
is just a prop

3538.559 --> 3544.6800000000003
Ancient Aliens the guy is literally like

3541.68 --> 3548.5789999999997
a living prop he's just there to

3544.68 --> 3550.44
like whoo aliens ooh the hair guy I mean

3548.579 --> 3553.559
he did absolutely

3550.44 --> 3556.5
there's almost nobody in this world

3553.559 --> 3558.599
that doesn't think of that guy and his

3556.5 --> 3559.98
crazy hair when they hear the word

3558.599 --> 3563.46
aliens

3559.98 --> 3566.46
so he did kind of do his job

3563.46 --> 3569.04
I mean everybody now Associates that guy

3566.46 --> 3573.7200000000003
in his stupid hair with aliens

3569.04 --> 3578.24
so I'd say pretty successful whenever

3573.72 --> 3578.24
he literally became the face of aliens

3578.76 --> 3583.079
just by having stupid hair and being on

3581.28 --> 3585.619
television I mean that's pretty

3583.079 --> 3585.619
impressive

3588.78 --> 3594.78
it's not very impressive in a good way

3591.18 --> 3597.319
but it is effective

3594.78 --> 3599.88
everybody knows you

3597.319 --> 3602.22
although I bet that nobody really knows

3599.88 --> 3603.9
his name but everybody knows like the

3602.22 --> 3605.16
guy what he looks like everybody knows

3603.9 --> 3608.04
what you mean

3605.16 --> 3610.2799999999997
anyway I'm gonna get my song be right

3608.04 --> 3610.2799999999997
back

3617.64 --> 3620.42
you know

3648.14 --> 3655.44
but yeah the aliens the Ancient Aliens

3651.599 --> 3659.2200000000003
guy I don't know why he always insists

3655.44 --> 3663.0
why did he choose to have Centauri hair

3659.22 --> 3666.839
from Babylon 5 very weird because it was

3663.0 --> 3669.0
a freaking Century hairdo let's just be

3666.839 --> 3671.64
very clear about that

3669.0 --> 3674.28
if you know Babylon 5 then you know the

3671.64 --> 3677.1189999999997
ancient alien guys is a Centauri

3674.28 --> 3677.119
basically

3678.9 --> 3683.819
so he probably he didn't even invent

3681.24 --> 3686.5789999999997
that type of hairdo it Babylon 5 was

3683.819 --> 3690.2
there before Ancient Aliens

3686.579 --> 3691.88
so he saw Babylon five and thought like

3690.2 --> 3694.0789999999997
yeah

3691.88 --> 3696.839
that's the stuff

3694.079 --> 3698.54
that's gonna be my hairdo when I do my

3696.839 --> 3701.4
ancient alien show

3698.54 --> 3703.38
I bet it was I bet that's exactly what

3701.4 --> 3709.94
happened

3703.38 --> 3709.94
[Music]

3740.72 --> 3747.24
all right anyway I'm gonna dig in

3744.119 --> 3750.5
I'm really hungry at this point so ah

3747.24 --> 3750.5
it's hot freaking hot

3751.5 --> 3755.059
okay so I have to wait for a bit

3758.94 --> 3762.179
[Music]

3780.299 --> 3785.94
language

3782.819 --> 3787.5589999999997
same resemble right well

3785.94 --> 3790.38
I mean

3787.559 --> 3795.059
the way people use language in the way

3790.38 --> 3796.44
they think evolves the spirit evolves

3795.059 --> 3799.7400000000002
and so

3796.44 --> 3804.299
the things that are often lost

3799.74 --> 3807.319
in ancient language is things that we no

3804.299 --> 3807.319
longer do

3809.88 --> 3816.42
because technically there were a lot of

3813.2 --> 3819.18
superstitions although not the majority

3816.42 --> 3821.2200000000003
is actually a few superstitions that

3819.18 --> 3823.859
were very tenacious for a very long time

3821.22 --> 3825.0589999999997
that people just kind of do culturally

3823.859 --> 3827.5789999999997
because

3825.059 --> 3830.8190000000004
they don't really know what what causes

3827.579 --> 3833.819
that or whatever you know

3830.819 --> 3836.52
and so they build superstitions in

3833.819 --> 3839.819
between actually figuring it out

3836.52 --> 3842.52
and the way people think

3839.819 --> 3846.319
determines how they're gonna use their

3842.52 --> 3849.18
language you can even see this with with

3846.319 --> 3852.359
language regions

3849.18 --> 3856.6189999999997
and like the same language in different

3852.359 --> 3858.7799999999997
regions like England America

3856.619 --> 3861.1800000000003
like very different

3858.78 --> 3865.079
and like the way they think is different

3861.18 --> 3866.3999999999996
the way their thoughts work is different

3865.079 --> 3869.1600000000003
and

3866.4 --> 3871.14
the way the Ancients were thinking as

3869.16 --> 3873.8999999999996
they were designing and using their

3871.14 --> 3877.2599999999998
language would have been different with

3873.9 --> 3880.799
like the frequency is kind of alien

3877.26 --> 3883.619
and because we are so alienated to that

3880.799 --> 3887.4
that's what makes it hard for us to see

3883.619 --> 3890.04
through it to see other meanings that

3887.4 --> 3892.64
are not really in our face and relevant

3890.04 --> 3892.64
to us now

3898.68 --> 3904.68
it's because the way people think

3901.26 --> 3907.2000000000003
actually changes

3904.68 --> 3909.839
the way language is used

3907.2 --> 3913.799
when just look at English people have

3909.839 --> 3915.42
like weird little sayings that are not

3913.799 --> 3919.5
normal English

3915.42 --> 3921.2400000000002
but it's like a compacted coded way of

3919.5 --> 3924.54
putting things together like a daily

3921.24 --> 3926.8799999999997
life typical experience or a set of

3924.54 --> 3928.98
experiences that are summarized with

3926.88 --> 3933.42
just a couple of words

3928.98 --> 3935.76
well if you're not English you have no

3933.42 --> 3938.819
[ __ ] idea what they're saying when

3935.76 --> 3942.5400000000004
they're saying such things yeah

3938.819 --> 3945.119
same problem goes for way in the past

3942.54 --> 3947.7599999999998
because I'll bet your ass that people

3945.119 --> 3950.579
did the same thing

3947.76 --> 3953.7000000000003
they would have like a Subway of using

3950.579 --> 3956.579
like a sub format using their language

3953.7 --> 3959.52
to describe typical daily things

3956.579 --> 3962.2400000000002
that we just don't understand it when we

3959.52 --> 3962.24
read that now

3964.98 --> 3970.14
I mean it's only logical

3967.5 --> 3972.599
if there's language

3970.14 --> 3976.2599999999998
utilizations

3972.599 --> 3979.319
the ways we use language within existing

3976.26 --> 3982.2000000000003
flourishing language that people cannot

3979.319 --> 3984.119
figure out right now

3982.2 --> 3985.5589999999997
then how the hell are we supposed to

3984.119 --> 3989.7000000000003
figure out

3985.559 --> 3991.98
the intricacies of a dead language

3989.7 --> 3995.0389999999998
from thousands of years ago where we

3991.98 --> 3997.799
don't get the full manuscript of it all

3995.039 --> 4001.1600000000003
we don't have a complete library of it

3997.799 --> 4003.98
yeah dude it's really difficult

4001.16 --> 4006.2
because people make things complicated

4003.98 --> 4009.14
it's like coding it's like a local

4006.2 --> 4012.14
coding you have to encrypt

4009.14 --> 4014.96
your words so that only those directly

4012.14 --> 4017.0589999999997
surrounding you understand you so you

4014.96 --> 4019.76
share that on an intellectual level

4017.059 --> 4022.28
thereby creating a front

4019.76 --> 4024.8590000000004
of local protection against the outside

4022.28 --> 4028.2400000000002
world I think it's a natural mechanism

4024.859 --> 4028.24
that people do that

4030.319 --> 4036.44
I mean

4033.02 --> 4038.299
in certain regions people even do that

4036.44 --> 4040.7000000000003
per Village

4038.299 --> 4042.92
like the people in the village have

4040.7 --> 4045.5589999999997
their own way of saying certain things

4042.92 --> 4048.38
that over at the next freaking Village

4045.559 --> 4051.38
they don't know what it means but they

4048.38 --> 4054.44
do know that's from that Village

4051.38 --> 4056.539
okay it can go to the Village level it's

4054.44 --> 4058.28
not even like oh this country that

4056.539 --> 4062.9
country know it

4058.28 --> 4066.92
this is a mechanism that people do

4062.9 --> 4070.64
it's like local encryption

4066.92 --> 4073.339
local language encryption so only those

4070.64 --> 4074.72
directly surrounding you get it and you

4073.339 --> 4076.099
share that Bond

4074.72 --> 4078.5
that

4076.099 --> 4080.599
that keeps you unified and protected

4078.5 --> 4083.66
against influences from the outside

4080.599 --> 4085.7000000000003
world a little fortunately yeah if

4083.66 --> 4089.18
everybody still has a TV and at home

4085.7 --> 4093.0789999999997
then that still comes all through right

4089.18 --> 4096.44
so it's not super effective

4093.079 --> 4099.9800000000005
but yeah I mean this is electronic age

4096.44 --> 4103.419999999999
it probably worked fantastically for

4099.98 --> 4103.419999999999
thousands and thousands of years

4105.799 --> 4110.719
right

4399.219 --> 4405.4
heliocentrism atheism science

4402.56 --> 4405.400000000001
the fake sign

4405.8 --> 4410.900000000001
they're all lying

4409.52 --> 4415.76
why

4410.9 --> 4419.0
because they pretend very overtly

4415.76 --> 4421.76
pretend like they have all the facts

4419.0 --> 4423.8
and they're all super logical but they

4421.76 --> 4428.4800000000005
don't

4423.8 --> 4431.0
they lie about that they lie

4428.48 --> 4432.799999999999
about that they have the facts and that

4431.0 --> 4435.62
they know how it works

4432.8 --> 4437.860000000001
they can't even get logical fallacies

4435.62 --> 4437.86
straight

4439.1 --> 4444.679
they're just bluffing and lying that

4442.34 --> 4447.32
they have the facts and know it all

4444.679 --> 4449.42
and people fall for it and that's the

4447.32 --> 4452.659
problem

4449.42 --> 4455.719
that is the main problem why it exists

4452.659 --> 4459.62
if people wouldn't fall like a bunch of

4455.719 --> 4462.199
dumbasses or somebody having a bunch of

4459.62 --> 4463.28
gay ass glasses on and maybe a white lab

4462.199 --> 4464.839999999999
coat

4463.28 --> 4467.599999999999
or something

4464.84 --> 4470.3
from being relatively well spoken

4467.6 --> 4472.280000000001
they'll buy anything

4470.3 --> 4473.360000000001
they'll take everything they say for

4472.28 --> 4475.159
granted

4473.36 --> 4476.9
unless they have direct personal

4475.159 --> 4478.5199999999995
experience that contradicts what they're

4476.9 --> 4481.46
saying

4478.52 --> 4483.92
and that's the reason why all of this

4481.46 --> 4486.56
[ __ ] exists that's why the heliocentrism

4483.92 --> 4489.32
exists it's very alluring when you find

4486.56 --> 4491.719
out hey if I just pretend

4489.32 --> 4493.159
to know all of this and then that I'm

4491.719 --> 4495.38
really smart and that I'm really smart

4493.159 --> 4498.379999999999
because of this and then I can say that

4495.38 --> 4501.679
and people will say yes that's a great

4498.38 --> 4503.719
career move now I can just pretend to be

4501.679 --> 4507.14
smart all my life

4503.719 --> 4509.179
and people will agree with me and they

4507.14 --> 4512.3
will give me money because I they think

4509.179 --> 4515.54
I'm so smart that's a good deal

4512.3 --> 4517.1
even though the person is actually not

4515.54 --> 4519.38
smart at all

4517.1 --> 4520.46
maybe a dreamer may be pretty good at

4519.38 --> 4522.56
talking

4520.46 --> 4524.4800000000005
kind of an idiot

4522.56 --> 4527.4800000000005
and that yeah

4524.48 --> 4530.659
but everybody thinks they're super smart

4527.48 --> 4533.0599999999995
because it's agreed upon if you talk

4530.659 --> 4535.219
about those things and you know a lot

4533.06 --> 4536.42
about those things then you are super

4535.219 --> 4538.699
smart

4536.42 --> 4541.159
even though it's all [ __ ] it's all

4538.699 --> 4544.099999999999
bunch of garbage made up it's like very

4541.159 --> 4547.159
poorly crafted logic

4544.1 --> 4549.26
very poorly crafted

4547.159 --> 4551.92
but it's the peer pressure that makes it

4549.26 --> 4554.84

4551.92 --> 4555.7390000000005
heliocentrism and supposed atheist

4554.84 --> 4562.54
science

4555.739 --> 4562.54
it's all a lie it's egregious lie

4563.3 --> 4568.88
it's all pretense it's all Bluff it's

4566.48 --> 4572.32
all posturing

4568.88 --> 4572.32
it's all wrong

4573.98 --> 4580.759999999999

[ __ ] easily influenced and [ __ ]

4580.76 --> 4586.34
and then it went there of influence when

4583.699 --> 4589.04
they buy a bullshitter

4586.34 --> 4590.78
then if somebody tells them no that's a

4589.04 --> 4593.42
bullshitter then they'll even freaking

4590.78 --> 4596.5
start defending the [ __ ] that's

4593.42 --> 4600.14
actually trying to fool them yeah that's

exploit them with a reversed World idea

4608.96 --> 4614.26
it's almost impossible not to do it

because people are so [ __ ]

4614.26 --> 4620.0
degeneratively [ __ ] it's almost

impossible to avoid doing it they'll

4694.58 --> 4699.58
it's blade it's a blatant satanic Coupe

4700.04 --> 4706.76
there was an original Bible

4703.82 --> 4709.42
that was directly written by Jesus

4706.76 --> 4709.42
apostles

4711.64 --> 4716.4400000000005
then

4713.36 --> 4720.679
the church Powers came together

4716.44 --> 4725.0599999999995
destroyed Jesus's actual old work

4720.679 --> 4728.3
and then Council of nicaea made a new

Christ's texts

it's literally the devil's book it's

5178.78 --> 5182.08
can you imagine

5180.82 --> 5183.46
that

5182.08 --> 5188.28
God

5183.46 --> 5188.28
would return manifest return

5188.739 --> 5194.32
right and who guess what is not looking

5191.139 --> 5196.78
like Jesus oh yeah surprise surprise

5194.32 --> 5198.88
yeah and then he finds all these [ __ ]

5196.78 --> 5200.44
Christians everywhere telling them the

5198.88 --> 5203.8
stupid riddle

5200.44 --> 5206.799999999999
telling them that Jesus is God yeah you

5203.8 --> 5208.96
know what God coming back to Earth if

5206.8 --> 5211.3
that even will happen if that can happen

5208.96 --> 5214.179
I don't know I'm not sure

5211.3 --> 5217.9800000000005
you know what happened he'd [ __ ] burn

5214.179 --> 5217.9800000000005
the lot of you yeah

5221.38 --> 5227.7390000000005
because you're irredeemable

5224.08 --> 5231.58
your irredeemably idiotic you have

5227.739 --> 5234.78
signed with the Devil with pure illogic

5231.58 --> 5238.42
yeah going with chance

5234.78 --> 5240.4
derived from a book when the chance

5238.42 --> 5243.179
the chance that you do that you think

5240.4 --> 5243.179
are so critical

5243.719 --> 5251.08
overtly contradict the very foundational

5248.02 --> 5252.219
rules of your own [ __ ] book

5251.08 --> 5255.54
yeah

5252.219 --> 5255.54
you're idiots

5257.72 --> 5260.869000000001
[Music]

5276.34 --> 5279.479
[Music]

5283.56 --> 5289.2390000000005
stop the [ __ ] chanting why don't you

5287.32 --> 5291.759999999999
just listen to Christ

5289.239 --> 5295.599999999999
why don't you actually study him his

5291.76 --> 5298.679
words the exact things he did

5295.6 --> 5298.679
the details

5300.46 --> 5304.6
and stop making him into a stupid

5302.38 --> 5307.84
cartoon figure

5304.6 --> 5311.88
that's also God and all that [ __ ] I

5307.84 --> 5311.88
mean it's so pointless

5317.139 --> 5319.7390000000005
thank you

5326.4 --> 5331.54
bad comments of I don't give a [ __ ] what

5329.02 --> 5333.46
Neil says Neil is a religious [ __ ]

5331.54 --> 5335.88
Zealot and he's been whining about me

5333.46 --> 5335.88
forever

5336.219 --> 5341.08
I'm sorry Neil I can't help you if

5338.86 --> 5343.839999999999
you're that [ __ ] locked up mentally

5341.08 --> 5346.239
then I can't help you same goes for 10th

5343.84 --> 5349.84
man at least he shuts the [ __ ] up about

5346.239 --> 5350.86
it he knows he actually follows Christ's

5349.84 --> 5354.04
teaching

5350.86 --> 5355.839999999999
and doesn't persecute me like a

5354.04 --> 5358.48
disgusting little demon on the loose

5355.84 --> 5359.92
like most Christians that get traded

5358.48 --> 5361.178999999999
like that

5359.92 --> 5365.92
yeah

5361.179 --> 5369.219
is actually wise enough to hold back

5365.92 --> 5372.84
Neil Neil's just a ball he doesn't

5369.219 --> 5372.84
control himself so

5375.46 --> 5380.8
and he's all right I mean he's okay

5378.46 --> 5383.56
but he needs to get a [ __ ] grip on

5380.8 --> 5385.6
his stupid religion

5383.56 --> 5387.6990000000005
because it's wrong you're chanting

5385.6 --> 5388.780000000001
nonsense it needs to stop

5387.699 --> 5391.78
yeah

5388.78 --> 5393.94
you can't on one hand be all oh but we

5391.78 --> 5396.4
have the details of the Flat Earth and

5393.94 --> 5398.86
it's not a global series of logic here

5396.4 --> 5402.04
and there and then start chanting

5398.86 --> 5404.98
[ __ ] self-contradicting retardation

5402.04 --> 5407.28
and then expect that to be compatible it

5404.98 --> 5407.28
isn't

5408.94 --> 5411.94
foreign

5425.04 --> 5430.06
stitching is written in the Bible it's

5428.5 --> 5433.739
still there

5430.06 --> 5433.7390000000005
it's highlighted in red

5435.46 --> 5440.139
the words

5437.08 --> 5443.38
Christ has in the Bible I'm pretty

5440.139 --> 5445.4800000000005
convinced they are his words

5443.38 --> 5447.04
it's just everything else that happens

5445.48 --> 5450.04
in the book is being completely

5447.04 --> 5450.04
rearranged

5450.94 --> 5457.96
things help took out of it taken out of

5454.659 --> 5461.199
it and Rewritten to abide to the

5457.96 --> 5464.34
astrological situation right

5461.199 --> 5464.339999999999
it's a rewrite

5465.04 --> 5474.3
it's like a Rewritten theatrical play

5468.06 --> 5474.3
based on an original real life person

5474.34 --> 5481.62
Christ is real his words are real

5477.76 --> 5481.62
the Bible is [ __ ]

5481.9 --> 5486.46
but still an interesting book though

5484.3 --> 5488.62
it's it's still very

5486.46 --> 5489.82
enlightening you can still learn a lot

5488.62 --> 5492.34
from it

5489.82 --> 5494.799999999999
but if you then proceed to go all for

5492.34 --> 5496.84
full hair minuetic on it

5494.8 --> 5499.0
and follow what all these priests over

5496.84 --> 5503.5
the ages have said on how to interpret

5499.0 --> 5503.5
it you're completely [ __ ]

5508.739 --> 5511.739
thank you

5517.57 --> 5520.889999999999
[Music]

5533.92 --> 5542.02
yeah no George Sanford Jesus is a man

5539.02 --> 5545.080000000001
and also the sun has something to do

5542.02 --> 5547.540000000001
with it for sure

5545.08 --> 5550.9
but his words are his words those are

5547.54 --> 5556.6
the words of a man the man called Jesus

5550.9 --> 5559.96
a man that absolutely physically existed

5556.6 --> 5561.88
and that did say those words

5559.96 --> 5565.3
yeah

5561.88 --> 5567.52
now all this sun worship and even him

5565.3 --> 5569.4400000000005
saying that he is God

5567.52 --> 5572.639
that's the [ __ ]

5569.44 --> 5572.638999999999
that's the horseshit

5579.46 --> 5585.659
yeah that's right Mark caller they

5581.26 --> 5585.659000000001
completely raped him his religion

5586.6 --> 5591.219
kill them

5588.159 --> 5593.32
then they killed his teachings

5591.219 --> 5598.6
they stole them

5593.32 --> 5602.58
rewrote them into an idolat an idolatry

5598.6 --> 5602.58
book of crazy chance

5603.46 --> 5606.6
and occultism

5611.12 --> 5616.739
[Music]

5613.02 --> 5616.7390000000005
the words are the words

5618.58 --> 5626.159
and there is historical indication that

5621.34 --> 5626.159000000001
he definitely existed from many fronts

5627.28 --> 5633.0599999999995
foreign

5629.08 --> 5633.0599999999995
but I mean it is a giant mess

5636.639 --> 5640.32
because of the rewriting

5640.78 --> 5646.3
and I'm pretty sure evidence has been

5643.199 --> 5648.839999999999
falsely created to try and support this

5646.3 --> 5648.84
rewrite

5688.659 --> 5693.638999999999
yeah I know Mark collard

5691.78 --> 5696.58
that they didn't like that Jesus

5693.639 --> 5698.9800000000005
actually talked about reincarnation

5696.58 --> 5701.0199999999995
like in the book of Thomas they really

5698.98 --> 5704.138999999999
did not like that because it

5701.02 --> 5706.84
contradicted the church cosmology that

5704.139 --> 5709.6
they wanted to force upon everybody

5706.84 --> 5712.360000000001
in order to get that peer pressure power

5709.6 --> 5716.320000000001
over people by being able to threaten

5712.36 --> 5720.759999999999
them with hell which they created

5716.32 --> 5724.0199999999995
yeah the conception of afterlife hell

5720.76 --> 5724.02
is not that old

5724.9 --> 5732.5199999999995
it was roughly created by the Catholic

5728.739 --> 5735.299999999999
Church they invented it

5732.52 --> 5735.3
get it

5764.62 --> 5771.239
all right so welcome to animation that's

5767.679 --> 5771.2390000000005
the Christ from Jerusalem

5774.699 --> 5782.219
right

5776.62 --> 5782.219
because it's probably not from Jerusalem

5784.75 --> 5787.81
[Music]

5794.88 --> 5800.76
[Music]

5796.96 --> 5800.76
where that yeah I know

5809.98 --> 5812.099999999999
um

5848.26 --> 5854.6990000000005
that's interesting Adam I don't know

5850.78 --> 5854.699
I don't know that in this moment

5859.36 --> 5861.96
A Thousand Years

5862.0 --> 5868.32
hilarious

5863.8 --> 5868.320000000001
Kevin that's freaking hilarious

5883.46 --> 5888.47
[Applause]

5885.42 --> 5888.47
[Music]

5914.92 --> 5920.1990000000005
a lot of girls elected yeah but I mean

5917.92 --> 5922.4800000000005
seriously Miracles is a freaking

5920.199 --> 5924.339999999999
political thing in the church it's

5922.48 --> 5926.199
ridiculous

5924.34 --> 5929.08
yeah

5926.199 --> 5931.0599999999995
because it's only a miracle if it's

5929.08 --> 5934.48
directly created by God because magic

5931.06 --> 5937.719
happens all the time yeah lay on hands

5934.48 --> 5941.32
what I can do like you could say oh it's

5937.719 --> 5943.78
a miracle why because we are we have

5941.32 --> 5946.179
decided being the church that it is

5943.78 --> 5949.12
originating from God so it is a miracle

5946.179 --> 5951.219
that's literally what that is guys

5949.12 --> 5953.5599999999995
yeah

5951.219 --> 5956.5
it's ridiculous it's like a political

5953.56 --> 5958.84
statement saying it's a miracle

5956.5 --> 5961.36
it doesn't have anything to do with the

5958.84 --> 5964.679
actual thing

5961.36 --> 5964.679
it's so stupid

5966.159 --> 5971.0199999999995
yeah people do magical healing all the

5970.06 --> 5974.320000000001
time

5971.02 --> 5977.7390000000005
lay on hands Spirit healing

5974.32 --> 5981.04
all kinds of things and it works it very

5977.739 --> 5983.4
much works not all the time but it does

5981.04 --> 5983.4
work

5984.82 --> 5989.92
and yeah

5986.739 --> 5993.638999999999
I mean are those all noted as Miracles

5989.92 --> 5996.46
no it's only noted as a miracle when

5993.639 --> 5998.82
it's politically decided that it's a

5996.46 --> 5998.82
miracle

5999.46 --> 6004.359
foreign

6001.03 --> 6004.3589999999995
[Music]

6042.84 --> 6047.400000000001
yeah the post Bible miracles

6045.9 --> 6049.08
that's what Flyers say just talking

6047.4 --> 6053.179
about that's what I mentioned too and

6049.08 --> 6053.179
it's all just politics after that point

6053.4 --> 6059.36
it's like that the church like said like

6056.76 --> 6062.280000000001
we are taking over from Christ so now

6059.36 --> 6063.839999999999
they had to like keep performing

6062.28 --> 6066.719
miracles

6063.84 --> 6068.76
because of that claim that they are

6066.719 --> 6071.76
taking over for Christ you see that they

6068.76 --> 6075.179
are the Christ wicker thicker what is it

6071.76 --> 6077.88
that's why they needed to have Miracles

6075.179 --> 6080.42
performed because of that claim is all

6077.88 --> 6080.42
political

6080.46 --> 6084.02
and complete nonsense

6095.699 --> 6102.678999999999
yeah that's right Christ fought the

6098.219 --> 6102.679
church then the church killed Christ

6102.9 --> 6110.28
rewrote his book and then said we then

6106.26 --> 6112.9800000000005
literally declared we are taking over

6110.28 --> 6116.42
for Christ yeah

6112.98 --> 6116.419999999999
like we are

6116.699 --> 6123.299999999999
taking over his role when he

6120.26 --> 6126.4800000000005
the church was his enemy

6123.3 --> 6131.219
so they literally like I said

6126.48 --> 6134.459999999999
skin him and then put his skin on

6131.219 --> 6136.86
that's what the church did

6134.46 --> 6139.28
it's really sick when you think about it

6136.86 --> 6139.28
carefully

6148.98 --> 6151.459999999999
people

6188.28 --> 6192.54
yeah and then I mean it's all just

6191.159 --> 6195.239
creepy

6192.54 --> 6197.04
they would all do it to themselves it's

6195.239 --> 6200.04
it's like

6197.04 --> 6202.32
I mean teenagers might cut themselves

6200.04 --> 6203.88
they get attention right

6202.32 --> 6207.36
well

6203.88 --> 6209.52
Catholic priests will literally Pierce

6207.36 --> 6212.94
their own hands and be like oh it's a

6209.52 --> 6215.34
miracle yeah that's what they do it's

6212.94 --> 6217.678999999999
just like teenagers cutting themselves

6215.34 --> 6221.400000000001
because they want attention it's really

6217.679 --> 6225.679
not that far off each other okay

6221.4 --> 6225.679
can you feel how ridiculous it is now

6250.08 --> 6253.0199999999995
yeah it is

6251.09 --> 6255.3
[Music]

6253.02 --> 6258.0
the only difference though is that the

6255.3 --> 6259.38
church actually Praises them and

6258.0 --> 6262.8
condones it

6259.38 --> 6264.42
oh a kid that cuts themselves

6262.8 --> 6267.84
like their parents are not going to be

6264.42 --> 6270.6
oh you're so brave they're not going to

6267.84 --> 6272.54
be like oh yeah my cut kids himself

6270.6 --> 6275.76
that's

6272.54 --> 6277.01
it's a really important no it's going

6275.76 --> 6279.719
through such a struggle

6277.01 --> 6283.1990000000005
[Music]

6279.719 --> 6285.84
no no parents don't cut down that and

6283.199 --> 6289.44
they try not to brag about it the church

6285.84 --> 6291.719
however they put these priests that did

6289.44 --> 6293.219
them to themselves on a pedestal say

6291.719 --> 6296.1
they are Saint now

6293.219 --> 6297.179
Christ message them like they reward

6296.1 --> 6298.619000000001
them

6297.179 --> 6302.2390000000005
for their

6298.619 --> 6302.239
sick Behavior

6305.82 --> 6310.139
or maybe maybe it isn't even like maybe

6308.28 --> 6312.659
it's like a political decision for like

6310.139 --> 6315.4800000000005
we need a miracle now to distract the

6312.659 --> 6318.719
people uh who's willing to take holes in

6315.48 --> 6321.119
their hands who's willing to bleed for a

6318.719 --> 6324.06
political maneuver it could be like that

6321.119 --> 6327.5599999999995
too it could be even

6324.06 --> 6327.56
that is not even like

6328.44 --> 6332.94
people desperate to be part of a miracle

6330.96 --> 6335.699
and fake it it could literally just be

6332.94 --> 6337.32
political politically decided like oh we

6335.699 --> 6338.82
need a miracle now to distract the

6337.32 --> 6340.159
people are they going to burn down the

6338.82 --> 6343.699
church

6340.159 --> 6343.699
it could be that

6350.52 --> 6354.1990000000005
obviously no

6368.46 --> 6373.4
I don't believe in the Trinity like that

6370.739 --> 6373.4
at all

6375.06 --> 6380.34
I think it's an interesting symbol

6378.179 --> 6384.619
it's an interesting concept but it's

6380.34 --> 6384.619000000001
like more esoteric than it's literal

6385.92 --> 6392.76
but no I I do not ascribe to the Trinity

6389.159 --> 6394.86
I don't think Jesus is God

6392.76 --> 6397.4400000000005
I think he was very close to God I think

6394.86 --> 6399.839999999999
he was God he was a messenger

6397.44 --> 6402.0
he was a prophet

6399.84 --> 6404.58
a very important one

6402.0 --> 6406.5
maybe the most important one but he was

6404.58 --> 6409.0199999999995
not God

6406.5 --> 6411.44
and I don't think he changed the law

6409.02 --> 6411.4400000000005
either

6411.48 --> 6416.54
I don't think he intended to change the

6414.36 --> 6416.54
law

6418.739 --> 6425.699
he intended to change the ways of people

6423.36 --> 6428.219
find a way through

6425.699 --> 6431.159
get the better format

6428.219 --> 6433.619
like from direct inspiration of God's

6431.159 --> 6435.54
enlightenment

6433.619 --> 6437.96
but he was not there to change

6435.54 --> 6437.96
everything

6444.54 --> 6447.48
he

6445.679 --> 6449.4
like

6447.48 --> 6452.4
halted

6449.4 --> 6454.5
like ritual habits

6452.4 --> 6456.739
within the Jewish religion he did do

6454.5 --> 6456.739
that

6467.82 --> 6473.179
he said he was God no I don't think he

6471.0 --> 6473.179
did

6473.639 --> 6479.400000000001
I said he said something esoteric as in

6476.159 --> 6481.799999999999
I am with God and God is with me and

6479.4 --> 6484.799999999999
like we I mean him need that sort of

6481.8 --> 6488.1
thing but that's like spiritual talk

6484.8 --> 6491.639
it's not literal

6488.1 --> 6493.320000000001
like Jesus did a lot of metaphorical

6491.639 --> 6495.6
talking

6493.32 --> 6501.0199999999995
it's like magic talking

6495.6 --> 6501.02
when it's all esoteric it's not literal

6503.46 --> 6506.2390000000005
those things

6506.82 --> 6511.139
I mean that's not a literal sentence

6508.92 --> 6513.719
like that

6511.139 --> 6515.639
you can't take that literal it has to be

6513.719 --> 6519.26
taken symbolic because that is what it

6515.639 --> 6519.26
is it can't be literal

6520.219 --> 6524.699
yeah

6521.94 --> 6525.659
and he did not declare himself God if

6524.699 --> 6528.0
anything

6525.659 --> 6530.839999999999
he talked about God and now being with

6528.0 --> 6534.06
God and I'm pretty damn sure that

6530.84 --> 6536.76
as a result of that

6534.06 --> 6539.6990000000005
basically his opponents

6536.76 --> 6541.619000000001
start blabbing on like he claimed he was

6539.699 --> 6545.28
God

6541.619 --> 6549.259999999999
so I think that the whole

6545.28 --> 6552.3
uh idolatry was basically pinned on him

6549.26 --> 6556.04
it was pinned on him he wanted people to

6552.3 --> 6556.04
be close to God to be with God

6558.9 --> 6564.48
and so he kind of normalized it saying

6561.719 --> 6567.719
like I'm with God I am God like but not

6564.48 --> 6570.419999999999
because he is the god no it's because he

6567.719 --> 6572.699
thought everybody could be with God

6570.42 --> 6575.1
that's what he was trying to example I

6572.699 --> 6577.259999999999
was just trying to show

6575.1 --> 6579.2390000000005
and then people didn't like that and so

6577.26 --> 6582.1990000000005
they accused him of saying that he's

6579.239 --> 6582.199
literally God

6586.26 --> 6591.4800000000005
and then that was used against him

6588.96 --> 6593.84
within law because you're not allowed to

6591.48 --> 6593.839999999999
do that

6594.239 --> 6600.48
like within Roman law and within Jewish

6598.26 --> 6603.5
law there was no law that would allow it

6600.48 --> 6603.5
to say that you are God

6610.679 --> 6614.84
oh hey guntherone good to see you

6618.86 --> 6623.58
God the spirit

6621.9 --> 6626.5199999999995
yeah

6623.58 --> 6627.16
I mean God was definitely with Jesus for

6626.52 --> 6630.25
sure

6627.16 --> 6630.25
[Music]

6655.139 --> 6657.56
oh

6680.94 --> 6687.138999999999
don't take yeah I'm not a young Earth

6682.98 --> 6687.138999999999
creationist absolutely not

6695.98 --> 6706.228999999999
[Music]

6723.8 --> 6728.58
right anyway I hope you guys have been

6726.719 --> 6731.34
enjoying the show

6728.58 --> 6734.179
trying to figure out what kind of title

6731.34 --> 6734.179
am I gonna give this

6767.88 --> 6772.8
oh wow really

6769.8 --> 6772.8
level

6777.26 --> 6784.1
wow that I did not know that that's

6779.88 --> 6784.1
pretty amazing Jamie huh

6787.15 --> 6790.2
[Music]

6790.8 --> 6795.4800000000005
well it it seems only logical that they

6793.32 --> 6798.84
invented writing that way

6795.48 --> 6801.299999999999
they had some kind of a sound board

6798.84 --> 6803.82
and then they would like speak into it

6801.3 --> 6806.28
and then every time they spoke

6803.82 --> 6808.139
sand would gather around and like show

6806.28 --> 6810.84
the symbol so then they have they had

6808.139 --> 6813.119
the letters yeah so their writing would

6810.84 --> 6816.5
have been made semantically

6813.119 --> 6816.5
that's really fascinating

6827.04 --> 6829.639
what

6832.98 --> 6837.08
what are you talking about Adam you can

6843.6 --> 6849.38
Hebrew Hebrew was made up really in 18th

6847.08 --> 6849.38
century

6850.02 --> 6855.1990000000005
whoa

6852.48 --> 6855.199
what the [ __ ]

6874.8 --> 6877.46
huh

6885.44 --> 6891.379999999999
how do you know it was made up in the

6887.76 --> 6891.38
18th century who made it up

6910.86 --> 6916.5
no there's no fvd today Stevie Traveler

6914.76 --> 6920.42
I don't think so at least Nathan's

6916.5 --> 6920.42
computer still not fixed

6929.4 --> 6936.36
okay yeah he's still on it I mean

6933.98 --> 6939.0
it's unlikely there's gonna be a live

6936.36 --> 6942.86
show today maybe tomorrow maybe later

6939.0 --> 6942.86
today but probably not

6958.56 --> 6961.56
constructed

6962.639 --> 6967.92
okay so they made it's a reconstructed

6966.0 --> 6970.92
language then

6967.92 --> 6970.92
hmm

7008.56 --> 7013.06
do I take Genesis literally

7017.659 --> 7023.259999999999
well there's so little of it Maximus

7020.6 --> 7023.26
Latias

7023.719 --> 7028.46
I mean Genesis is a very little piece of

7027.02 --> 7030.8
text

7028.46 --> 7033.699
I mean

7030.8 --> 7033.6990000000005
I don't know

7036.619 --> 7042.5599999999995
I have

7038.5 --> 7044.3
there is definitely a an attempt

7042.56 --> 7047.06
to read it

7044.3 --> 7048.92
uh literal

7047.06 --> 7052.04
I'm trying to look at it from both

7048.92 --> 7056.4400000000005
perspectives but it's like I don't know

7052.04 --> 7056.44
I don't know what that is exactly

7060.139 --> 7065.96
I have a lot of ideas about it

7062.96 --> 7069.159
but I mean it's more like from internal

7065.96 --> 7073.42
inspiration than it's really like

7069.159 --> 7073.42
historical or something I mean yeah

7077.2 --> 7080.29
[Music]

7081.8 --> 7087.320000000001
but I think that Genesis probably

7084.86 --> 7090.04
will turn out to be more literal than

7087.32 --> 7090.04
metaphorical

7101.9 --> 7108.32
did I mix it up damn it Genesis is the

7106.52 --> 7111.02
creation of the world

7108.32 --> 7114.259999999999
right yeah I think that that part is

7111.02 --> 7117.02
actually quite literally described

7114.26 --> 7119.96
it's not symbolic I was thinking of like

7117.02 --> 7121.88
Adam and Eve but that's not Genesis

7119.96 --> 7123.5
stupid of me

7121.88 --> 7126.02
uh

7123.5 --> 7128.659
yeah I think that in that

7126.02 --> 7131.0
the creation of the realm was probably

7128.659 --> 7134.739
quite literal but I mean there can be

7131.0 --> 7134.739
different versions of this story

7135.679 --> 7139.58
we know a certain version of it in the

7138.56 --> 7142.400000000001
Bible

7139.58 --> 7144.82
but there are different versions of this

7142.4 --> 7144.82
concept

7194.659 --> 7196.96
foreign

7226.01 --> 7229.169
[Music]

7239.659 --> 7247.179
I mean I have severe doubts about Noah

7243.139 --> 7247.179
story being absolutely literal

7247.699 --> 7250.9
because yeah

7251.48 --> 7256.54
it just doesn't make any sense

7253.52 --> 7256.540000000001
many ways

7257.48 --> 7261.879999999999
Adam and Eve a little bit more likely

7262.58 --> 7268.0599999999995
but still like could definitely be

7265.699 --> 7271.4
symbolic aspects about it

7268.06 --> 7272.2390000000005
but then the actual creation of their of

7271.4 --> 7275.36
Earth

7272.239 --> 7280.48
I think that that is

7275.36 --> 7280.48
probably very very literal

7280.639 --> 7284.719
I mean

7281.96 --> 7287.78
there's no purpose

7284.719 --> 7290.36
in seeing it as symbolic other than

7287.78 --> 7293.659
denial

7290.36 --> 7297.32
right you got to look at that factor too

7293.659 --> 7300.259999999999
like look at something little look at it

7297.32 --> 7304.219
as if it were symbolic what does that do

7300.26 --> 7307.280000000001
to you as the perceiver

7304.219 --> 7310.219
well if you could take something as

7307.28 --> 7313.159
symbolic but it would just water things

7310.219 --> 7315.44
down make it more vague well then it's

7313.159 --> 7318.86
obviously not meant as symbolic because

7315.44 --> 7320.96
it literally diffuses

7318.86 --> 7323.9
your Insight

7320.96 --> 7327.26
in your care so it obviously wouldn't

7323.9 --> 7329.36
have been meant symbolic then see

7327.26 --> 7331.659000000001
you got to consider that kind of thing

7329.36 --> 7331.659
too

7335.06 --> 7339.160000000001
right

7336.07 --> 7339.16
[Music]

7347.65 --> 7353.719

7350.06 --> 7355.820000000001

7353.719 --> 7359.92
disciples

7355.82 --> 7359.92
but not church

7360.08 --> 7364.34
right the church is where three men

7362.719 --> 7369.02
would be

7364.34 --> 7371.360000000001
or three men meet that is the church

7369.02 --> 7374.8
so he wouldn't call it he didn't he

7371.36 --> 7374.799999999999
wouldn't say make my church

7375.44 --> 7379.339999999999
we would say disciples like get

7377.96 --> 7382.219
followers and then the followers

7379.34 --> 7384.38
together would form an effective Church

7382.219 --> 7386.42
but he wouldn't like oh go build my

7384.38 --> 7388.84
church because he was obviously against

7386.42 --> 7388.84
that

I think I'm Gonna Leave the title blank

7443.78 --> 7451.46
today I mean it's probably just gonna be

7448.52 --> 7455.42
getting under people's skin if I start

7451.46 --> 7458.38
saying something about Christianity

7455.42 --> 7458.38
like

7459.86 --> 7464.239
if you say like the Bible is satanic or

7462.44 --> 7468.339999999999
something that's probably gonna just

7464.239 --> 7468.339999999999

7732.139 --> 7738.52
read it it might take a while before

he's going to be able to do a show again

7805.34 --> 7810.32
this is not about the interpretation of

original teaching

7814.099 --> 7818.119000000001
it was destroyed

7816.619 --> 7822.619
then

7818.119 --> 7826.28
was remade into the Bible like

7822.619 --> 7829.04
it's not even about how Catholics read

7826.28 --> 7832.84
the Bible it's about that the Bible is

7829.04 --> 7832.84
not the original real product

7842.06 --> 7847.719
it was an engineered into something else

7848.54 --> 7855.56
something that that Christ would never

7851.239 --> 7857.9
ever agree to to have that done

7855.56 --> 7861.1990000000005
with his work

7907.159 --> 7914.119
destruction but it is fundamentally

7909.5 --> 7918.02
about lies Satan is lies God is truth

7914.119 --> 7920.9
and that is a fact

7918.02 --> 7924.7390000000005
so what makes a real Satan is is that

7920.9 --> 7926.839999999999
what makes real Satanism is the ray is

7924.739 --> 7932.08
basically except normalizing and

7926.84 --> 7932.08
accepting obvious deranged Behavior

7932.239 --> 7940.239
like ignoring God's law ignoring how God

7936.86 --> 7945.219
designed it in favor of your own

7940.239 --> 7945.218999999999
contemporary will and lust

7945.32 --> 7950.9
that's Satanism it is like allowing

7948.44 --> 7953.2699999999995
yourself to be lied to

7950.9 --> 7955.098999999999
for your own personal pleasure

7953.27 --> 7958.159000000001
[Music]

7955.099 --> 7961.34
that's truly satanism

7958.159 --> 7964.94
and lie is at the very core Foundation

7961.34 --> 7966.4400000000005
of it all that's why Satan is lies

7964.94 --> 7969.079
literally

7966.44 --> 7971.919999999999
where there's lies there's Satan there's

7969.079 --> 7971.92
no way around it

7974.51 --> 7982.76
[Music]

7977.679 --> 7985.6990000000005
everything lies do with you Satan does

7982.76 --> 7988.6990000000005
weaken you twist you

7985.699 --> 7991.879999999999
drag you down

7988.699 --> 7994.82
but eventually always be defeated Every

7991.88 --> 7997.179
Lie is always exposed even if it takes

7994.82 --> 7997.179
forever

7999.139 --> 8006.579
God will always defeat Satan in the end

8003.579 --> 8006.579
inevitable

8014.739 --> 8019.598999999999
no Satanist will say that I don't give a

8017.92 --> 8022.2390000000005
[ __ ]

8019.599 --> 8024.34
I don't care about people and their

8022.239 --> 8026.86
personal little stupid religion that

8024.34 --> 8029.5
they would call satanism

8026.86 --> 8032.38
yeah I don't give a [ __ ]

8029.5 --> 8034.96
especially about this stupid atheist

8032.38 --> 8037.179
pessimism which is just uh it's just

8034.96 --> 8040.56
hipster hipsterism

8037.179 --> 8040.56
it's all horseshit

8040.659 --> 8046.0599999999995
I'm talking about esoteric Satanism and

8043.599 --> 8048.76
yeah an esoteric Satanist would never

8046.06 --> 8051.46
call himself an esoteric Satanist

8048.76 --> 8054.34
because it would be way too honest and

8051.46 --> 8057.099
the whole point of Satan and Satanism is

8054.34 --> 8060.099
that it's all lies so of course a

8057.099 --> 8062.5
Satanist is never gonna tell you exactly

8060.099 --> 8065.32
what he is and what he does

8062.5 --> 8067.8
because that would be the truth that's

8065.32 --> 8067.799999999999
the point

8104.079 --> 8108.719
frequency it's an influence

8106.48 --> 8112.48
it's a

8108.719 --> 8116.56
alchemical component of

8112.48 --> 8120.78
the essence of existence

8116.56 --> 8120.780000000001
is there it's a component

8121.3 --> 8123.84
yeah

8124.179 --> 8130.7390000000005

I've never heard of that

8287.38 --> 8289.38
um

8292.42 --> 8295.26
foreign

8299.82 --> 8305.26
no no Kevin no no the Bible does not

8303.34 --> 8309.16
disagree with that you know who

8305.26 --> 8312.82
disagrees with that priests priests that

8309.16 --> 8316.359
tell you you have to believe the riddle

8312.82 --> 8320.08
or you're damned to hell yeah yeah that

8316.359 --> 8325.359
doesn't you can't find that in any Bible

8320.08 --> 8329.92
because it's priests that say that yeah

8325.359 --> 8333.719000000001
not the Bible Kevin K not the Bible it's

8329.92 --> 8333.719000000001
priests that say that

8344.2 --> 8347.349
[Music]

8348.96 --> 8354.518999999998
have I read the Bible multiple times no

8352.24 --> 8356.26
Stevie traveler I haven't even fully

8354.519 --> 8359.859
read it once

8356.26 --> 8362.679
but you see I don't need to do that I

8359.859 --> 8364.479000000001
read people yeah I don't read books I

8362.679 --> 8368.559
read people

8364.479 --> 8372.76
and if people have read the Bible plenty

8368.559 --> 8374.679
then I can read what that did to them

8372.76 --> 8378.04
how they read it

8374.679 --> 8380.5
and I know things from the Bible through

8378.04 --> 8383.380000000001
other people and I know which people I

8380.5 --> 8386.439
can rely to what degree about what

8383.38 --> 8389.019999999999
within the Bible

8386.439 --> 8392.1
I don't read the Bible I don't read

8389.02 --> 8392.1
books I read people

8395.74 --> 8400.84
and not only read them I also freaking

8398.26 --> 8403.6
assimilate and copy

8400.84 --> 8405.64
tricks and behavior and even magical

8403.6 --> 8409.380000000001
powers if necessary

8405.64 --> 8409.38
and we're not even joking about that

8409.6 --> 8413.1
I don't get that from a book

8413.859 --> 8418.08
although reading Rudolph Steiner does

8416.14 --> 8420.34
actually have like a palpable

8418.08 --> 8421.6
physiological influence on it and that

8420.34 --> 8424.72
is kind of weird

8421.6 --> 8426.34
like much more than the Bible by the way

8424.72 --> 8428.56
because the Bible did that a little bit

8426.34 --> 8431.14
when I was really in a bad spot the

8428.56 --> 8433.359
Bible did really feel like magical and

8431.14 --> 8435.64
like getting me out of it

8433.359 --> 8438.52
but Rudolph Steiner book is like that

8435.64 --> 8440.619999999999
but even more strong in a different way

8438.52 --> 8443.52
though

8440.62 --> 8443.52
foreign

8448.92 --> 8455.26
Protestant leaders

8451.72 --> 8456.699999999999
oh Protestant leaders oh they think

8455.26 --> 8459.28
you're better because you're a

8456.7 --> 8463.560000000001
Protestant you know the Protestants are

8459.28 --> 8463.560000000001
just as terrible as the Catholics right

8463.96 --> 8471.24
they do the same thing mostly

8468.1 --> 8471.24
it was like a

8471.42 --> 8477.64
protestantism to Catholicism is like a

8474.54 --> 8481.18
left-wing or right wing thing

8477.64 --> 8485.519999999999
they're pretty much the same

8481.18 --> 8485.52
they just have minor differences

8487.6 --> 8495.1
I mean they follow the same book

8491.46 --> 8496.839999999998
Protestants literally have the same

8495.1 --> 8499.54
Bible

8496.84 --> 8502.26
that the Catholics made okay it's

8499.54 --> 8502.26
ridiculous

8503.38 --> 8507.699999999999
the only difference is that they just

8505.42 --> 8510.22
interpret things about it differently

8507.7 --> 8511.12
the priests say different things about

8510.22 --> 8514.119999999999
it

8511.12 --> 8517.5
that's it it's the same [ __ ] up book

8514.12 --> 8517.5
the same broken book

8536.439 --> 8540.58
yeah I'm not saying that the Bible is

8538.479 --> 8542.5
completely [ __ ] I might even get it

8540.58 --> 8544.3
gone a bit overboard here sorry about

8542.5 --> 8546.16
that

8544.3 --> 8549.16
it's just

8546.16 --> 8552.1
the Bible is not even that freaking evil

8549.16 --> 8554.28
or anything it's just that it's not the

8552.1 --> 8554.28
original

8556.78 --> 8562.300000000001
it's like talking about the Bible it's

8559.0 --> 8565.0
like yeah well the kid didn't come out

8562.3 --> 8567.519999999999
that bad despite being raped right

8565.0 --> 8569.859
that's kind of like how I see that it's

8567.52 --> 8572.04
like yeah it's still pretty cool but I

8569.859 --> 8572.04
mean

8572.26 --> 8577.72
it it still happened you know

8575.8 --> 8579.938999999998
that's kind of how I feel about the

8577.72 --> 8582.76
Bible it's like yeah it is pretty uh

8579.939 --> 8586.66
astounding and Jesus is in there but I

8582.76 --> 8591.22
mean it is not right

8586.66 --> 8595.0
it has been messed with provably

8591.22 --> 8596.56
it is not the original works

8595.0 --> 8599.38
and so

8596.56 --> 8601.6
that makes it like Satan book to me but

8599.38 --> 8604.619999999999
I mean you can still read it and get

8601.6 --> 8604.62
good things out of it

8605.8 --> 8610.42
it's really when you look at the Bible

8608.5 --> 8613.18
and you look at what priests say about

8610.42 --> 8615.1
it what priests say about it is more

8613.18 --> 8619.08
worrisome and more dangerous than

8615.1 --> 8619.08
actually what's written in the book

8619.3 --> 8622.42
Catholics have seven more books about

8621.34 --> 8623.74
Jesus

8622.42 --> 8626.399
really

8623.74 --> 8626.399
damn

8627.46 --> 8630.72
I forgot about that

8652.78 --> 8658.979000000001

8655.3 --> 8658.979

8794.319 --> 8799.979
oh come on flatter Sage that's a bit too

8796.66 --> 8799.979
far don't call it that

8800.319 --> 8804.539999999999
that's just defending his church

8804.58 --> 8809.74
right maybe he wasn't ready to deal with

8807.46 --> 8812.14
it emotionally what you just told him

8809.74 --> 8814.479
what I just told him maybe it was just a

8812.14 --> 8817.66
bit too far and it's just like trying to

8814.479 --> 8821.199999999999
scramble to just save his community

8817.66 --> 8824.02
so take it easy I mean

8821.2 --> 8825.52
I haven't seen Kevin k

8824.02 --> 8829.68
that much

8825.52 --> 8829.68
around anyway even though he is a member

8835.24 --> 8841.78
Christ isn't the founder are you serious

8839.14 --> 8844.858999999999
Kevin gay

8841.78 --> 8844.859
are you serious

8845.02 --> 8849.1
how the hell is he supposed to be the

8846.76 --> 8852.24
founder

8849.1 --> 8852.24

[Music]

8892.6 --> 8898.74
anyway yeah thanks Adam for being in the

8895.0 --> 8898.74
chat and giving all this

8898.78 --> 8903.220000000001
great data as you do I really appreciate

8901.72 --> 8905.64
you being in the chat here for today's

8903.22 --> 8905.64
show

8937.3 --> 8942.519999999999
yeah

8938.64 --> 8945.58
it's that's the theocracy days and in

8942.52 --> 8948.399000000001
the theocracy was all about power

8945.58 --> 8952.6
and they would send assassins yeah

8948.399 --> 8954.039999999999
sending assassins is not very Christian

8952.6 --> 8955.6
right

8954.04 --> 8958.479000000001
so

8955.6 --> 8961.18
yeah

8958.479 --> 8963.819
I mean obviously during the theocracy

8961.18 --> 8966.78
age the Catholic church was as satanic

8963.819 --> 8966.779999999999
as you can get

8967.42 --> 8970.42
torture

8970.66 --> 8973.66
slavery

8974.979 --> 8978.779999999999
all like all of it

8981.1 --> 8987.640000000001
right suppression of speech all just

8984.34 --> 8987.64
everything so

8988.12 --> 8992.2
like this shave women's hair because the

8990.22 --> 8993.819
woman's hair was like a symbol of her

8992.2 --> 8996.34
femininity

8993.819 --> 9000.979
feminine

8996.34 --> 9000.979
of her female nature that's why

9008.52 --> 9011.84
is it femininity

9043.92 --> 9046.04
okay

9049.22 --> 9053.819
all right but I think I'm gonna round

9051.42 --> 9056.04
out the show

9053.819 --> 9059.64
it's been a very interesting route could

9056.04 --> 9063.5
probably go on for hours but

9059.64 --> 9063.5
yeah I'm getting a little tired

9067.859 --> 9073.7
it's good to talk about this subject

9070.319 --> 9073.699999999999
again though for a show

9077.939 --> 9085.460000000001
it will be a reoccurring theme I mean

9080.28 --> 9085.460000000001
this is a long long going process

9085.8 --> 9089.819
and

9087.84 --> 9092.22
I'm here to sit it through I'm really

9089.819 --> 9094.439
glad to have somebody like Adam on my

9092.22 --> 9096.06
side with this because it is

9094.439 --> 9099.6
quite

9096.06 --> 9102.6
the bumpy road

9099.6 --> 9104.28
it's a very very bumpy road to walk this

9102.6 --> 9106.62
so

9104.28 --> 9109.5
it's great to have somebody that's just

9106.62 --> 9113.6
really well informed about it

9109.5 --> 9113.6
saves you a lot of toe ache

9118.74 --> 9124.699999999999
wait you became Catholic

9121.74 --> 9124.699999999999
what

9124.74 --> 9127.939
the [ __ ] Kevin

9129.06 --> 9132.5
why would you do that

9135.6 --> 9140.960000000001
I mean if you're born into it is one

9138.06 --> 9140.96
thing okay but

9144.899 --> 9149.88
I don't know a lot of people that

9146.64 --> 9152.039999999999
actually choose to become Catholic when

9149.88 --> 9153.42
they're not born in it

9152.04 --> 9156.140000000001
that's

9153.42 --> 9156.14
odd

9158.28 --> 9163.62
thus 10th man ever watch my show you got

9160.92 --> 9166.04
to be joking right steamy Traveler

9163.62 --> 9168.960000000001
you really think he'd do that

9166.04 --> 9172.979000000001
especially at this hour

9168.96 --> 9174.599999999999
no no I think he's probably not really

9172.979 --> 9178.438999999998
into like

9174.6 --> 9182.399000000001
high conflict about his private beliefs

9178.439 --> 9184.62
on the very very earliest of mornings

9182.399 --> 9187.399
I highly doubt it that he's gonna listen

9184.62 --> 9187.399000000001
to my show

9195.3 --> 9199.858999999999
unless it's to like counter whatever

9197.939 --> 9202.02
I've said maybe he's gonna watch this

9199.859 --> 9203.7
show because it's like oh he's talking

9202.02 --> 9204.960000000001
about the church again we have to check

9203.7 --> 9208.2
up on him

9204.96 --> 9209.819
to like protect ourselves against the

9208.2 --> 9213.300000000001
blasphemy

9209.819 --> 9216.06
literally these guys do that

9213.3 --> 9218.099999999999
it's a it's it's a thing they do

9216.06 --> 9220.14
they don't watch anything until they

9218.1 --> 9222.18
think that their special thing is

9220.14 --> 9224.399
attacked or they're attacked and then

9222.18 --> 9226.979000000001
they're gonna watch it all just to

9224.399 --> 9229.16
be able to crack it down or review it or

9226.979 --> 9229.16
something

9230.399 --> 9234.24
although I don't think they're gonna

9232.26 --> 9237.899
they're not like gonna literally review

9234.24 --> 9240.899
me that would just be like weird to do

9237.899 --> 9240.899
like

9245.76 --> 9250.319
but yeah every time I talk about the

9247.979 --> 9253.08
Bible or Christ or something then

9250.319 --> 9255.479
usually Neil comes diving in to check

9253.08 --> 9258.24
out if I didn't go too far this time

9255.479 --> 9259.979
yeah they do that they actually do that

9258.24 --> 9262.619999999999
really

9259.979 --> 9265.56
and because I know they do that I do my

9262.62 --> 9268.740000000002
best to see that if I'm gonna do it then

9265.56 --> 9272.539999999999
I will try to go too far not too far for

9268.74 --> 9272.539999999999
me but too far for them

9281.819 --> 9287.399
right so you can listen to me and hear

9284.58 --> 9289.56
me talk about and [ __ ] on church and how

9287.399 --> 9291.84
the Bible is all raped and all that you

9289.56 --> 9295.74
can hear all of that one thing you'll

9291.84 --> 9298.92
never ever hear me say though is that

9295.74 --> 9302.819
Christ doesn't exist

9298.92 --> 9304.979
like juices is fake and his teacher like

9302.819 --> 9307.92
it's nothing it's just the sun yeah

9304.979 --> 9310.38
that's something you'll never hear of me

9307.92 --> 9312.18
like even in the face of people telling

9310.38 --> 9314.22
me like yeah there's no actual evidence

9312.18 --> 9315.84
that there was a real person and it'll

9314.22 --> 9318.06
be like yeah

9315.84 --> 9320.7
I don't care

9318.06 --> 9323.399
I'm following the words

9320.7 --> 9325.740000000002
following his words

9323.399 --> 9327.66
follow that frequency I adapt to that

9325.74 --> 9330.24
frequency that's the frequency that I

9327.66 --> 9331.92
want to be I don't care if it was never

9330.24 --> 9334.14
a real person

9331.92 --> 9336.84
maybe it wasn't a real person but it was

9334.14 --> 9338.58
a real idea a real spirit that caught

9336.84 --> 9341.819
onto people

9338.58 --> 9345.66
well that Spirit then Echoes on and I'm

9341.819 --> 9348.119999999999
here to catch that spirit

9345.66 --> 9350.6
and it's funny because yeah the spirit

9348.12 --> 9350.6
of Christ

9350.76 --> 9356.64
is it yeah like even in the free

9354.18 --> 9360.24
Steiner cosmology okay

9356.64 --> 9363.42
there is the Christ spirit

9360.24 --> 9366.119999999999
and they are pretty much like Bible

9363.42 --> 9367.92
deniers in that sense

9366.12 --> 9371.28
like

9367.92 --> 9375.18
he doesn't yeah what I'm saying none of

9371.28 --> 9377.58
that would make the make Rudolph Steiner

9375.18 --> 9380.28
be like hey are you sure you want to say

9377.58 --> 9382.08
that no no he probably agrees with

9380.28 --> 9384.300000000001
everything I say

9382.08 --> 9387.72
I'm not even joking

9384.3 --> 9391.14
but Christ's Spirit yeah

9387.72 --> 9394.438999999998
that's a thing that's real that's a

9391.14 --> 9397.199999999999
thing even in that cosmology so whatever

9394.439 --> 9400.14
it is whatever Christ is

9397.2 --> 9402.12
whether he was really a human incarnated

9400.14 --> 9404.519999999999
being and now as some kind of spirit

9402.12 --> 9407.1
that's always there

9404.52 --> 9410.28
or whether it was only a spirit and just

9407.1 --> 9411.300000000001
an idea of a person I don't mind either

9410.28 --> 9415.5
way

9411.3 --> 9418.438999999998
it's a thing it's really important it's

9415.5 --> 9419.88
in the spirit realm palpably there and

9418.439 --> 9422.04
influential

9419.88 --> 9424.74
Christ is real

9422.04 --> 9427.979000000001
it doesn't matter whether he really was

9424.74 --> 9429.539999999999
a person or never was a person it

9427.979 --> 9434.0
doesn't matter to me

9429.54 --> 9434.0
it's real it's there it's good

9439.38 --> 9444.24
ah okay boys yeah I'm glad you're you

9442.14 --> 9446.64
guys are appreciating the longer shows I

9444.24 --> 9449.359
can do it now these days I I'm not super

9446.64 --> 9449.358999999999
tired out

9450.42 --> 9456.6
because it is it's kind of tiresome to

9453.479 --> 9459.0
do longer than two-hour shows

9456.6 --> 9460.74
but I mean I have a lot of energy

9459.0 --> 9464.46
recently

9460.74 --> 9466.439
a lot of Hope GTI is doing well great

9464.46 --> 9468.72
it's not really changed that much but I

9466.439 --> 9470.76
mean like I'm kind of astounded like

9468.72 --> 9474.479
sometimes it's like really a money dump

9470.76 --> 9477.18
that just like whoa okay that's that's

9474.479 --> 9478.56
an amount suddenly

9477.18 --> 9481.5
and so

9478.56 --> 9485.039999999999
I'm still growing that it seems to be

9481.5 --> 9487.02
going just fine although I'm still in

9485.04 --> 9490.140000000001
the hopes that I might some at some

9487.02 --> 9492.859
point just get some usdt from somebody

9490.14 --> 9492.858999999999
out there

9494.16 --> 9501.24
because I'm not willing or capable to to

9498.479 --> 9503.119999999999
like spend my own literal money that I

9501.24 --> 9506.52
need for food

9503.12 --> 9510.42
to get that stuff I just can't afford it

9506.52 --> 9512.34
really I should but I mean like

9510.42 --> 9514.38
I'd have to spend that money and then

9512.34 --> 9516.960000000001
wait for two freaking years before I get

9514.38 --> 9518.399
anything out in out of it and I probably

9516.96 --> 9521.099999999999
wouldn't even get anything out of it

9518.399 --> 9523.319
because then I would just reinvest it

9521.1 --> 9525.12
for more

9523.319 --> 9529.279999999999
and uh

9525.12 --> 9529.28
I can't miss that extra money

9529.56 --> 9533.46
so I'm just yeah

9531.54 --> 9536.6
I'm just waiting

9533.46 --> 9536.599999999999
until things get better

9539.88 --> 9544.74
it was real yeah sure maybe

9542.939 --> 9546.78
but if the shroud of turian was real

9544.74 --> 9549.6
then that would mean that Jesus Christ

9546.78 --> 9551.7
did actually live

9549.6 --> 9553.68
around what is it

9551.7 --> 9556.979000000001
1070

9553.68 --> 9559.14
because that's the material

9556.979 --> 9561.858999999999
of the Shroud of Turin that's what it

9559.14 --> 9561.858999999999
was dated at

9564.0 --> 9570.5
and well I think that that is probably

9566.7 --> 9570.5
pretty damn accurate since

9572.22 --> 9578.039999999999
yeah since Rome added

9576.42 --> 9581.460000000001
the one

9578.04 --> 9585.0
or the added they added a thousand in it

9581.46 --> 9588.0
they split apart history well if Jesus

9585.0 --> 9589.92
was actually present in in the medieval

9588.0 --> 9593.12
times late medieval times that would

9589.92 --> 9593.12
make perfect sense to me

9594.3 --> 9599.279999999999
it would also fit better it's like

9597.0 --> 9602.04
historically like with what was going on

9599.28 --> 9605.04
in France and everything it would make a

9602.04 --> 9607.979000000001
lot more sense if all of that

9605.04 --> 9610.7
would make more sense if Christ was much

9607.979 --> 9610.699999999999
more recent

9610.74 --> 9615.359
not if that happened a thousand years

9612.96 --> 9617.519999999999
ago because then so much would have

9615.359 --> 9619.5
happened since then it would like not

9617.52 --> 9622.979000000001
really stick as much but it if it was

9619.5 --> 9625.14
much more recent it makes more sense

9622.979 --> 9628.039999999999
makes more sense why everybody was so

9625.14 --> 9628.039999999999
passionate about it

9628.08 --> 9632.84
the Miracles were basically freshly

9630.479 --> 9632.84
happened

9634.319 --> 9636.92
right

9648.72 --> 9651.72
whatever

9654.78 --> 9660.84
it's a mirror itself Okay Kevin well

9658.5 --> 9662.58
that's cute I just know that it's very

9660.84 --> 9666.26
interesting that the shrouded Turin

9662.58 --> 9666.26
actually dates to like

9667.04 --> 9671.300000000001
1070.

9668.819 --> 9671.3
80

9674.52 --> 9678.560000000001
isn't that just interesting

9679.2 --> 9684.319000000001
you might want to take it from that

9681.84 --> 9684.319
point on

9686.85 --> 9694.2
[Music]

9692.16 --> 9695.34
ah

9694.2 --> 9698.939
right

9695.34 --> 9702.54
because I mean if it is what it is

9698.939 --> 9706.939
then you're gonna have to revisit how

9702.54 --> 9706.939
history has ordered things

9707.52 --> 9712.62
yeah yeah that's I got it right the

9709.62 --> 9712.62
1070.

9713.399 --> 9717.18
yeah cool

9715.02 --> 9719.1
but the Shroud of Turin actually dates

9717.18 --> 9721.62
to that

9719.1 --> 9723.84
so which is kind of funny because that

9721.62 --> 9726.18
would make it actually more likely that

9723.84 --> 9728.7
it was real because there was this whole

9726.18 --> 9732.300000000001
thing about old shredditures [ __ ] it

9728.7 --> 9734.04
can't be because it's 1 000 years too

9732.3 --> 9735.779999999999
young and it does make any sense with

9734.04 --> 9738.78
the timeline and

9735.78 --> 9741.960000000001
it's like yeah yeah oh okay it could all

9738.78 --> 9746.34
be fake I guess they probably made it up

9741.96 --> 9748.679999999998
but then again it's like oh wait but

9746.34 --> 9751.319
what if Christ just wasn't

9748.68 --> 9753.899
in that time what if it was

9751.319 --> 9757.08
a thousand years later

9753.899 --> 9758.699999999999
like really then like maybe that is

9757.08 --> 9760.74
actually what happened and that would

9758.7 --> 9762.720000000001
like suddenly

9760.74 --> 9765.119999999999
bring a new light and all these things

9762.72 --> 9768.96
that have happened

9765.12 --> 9773.399000000001
I mean it changes a lot guys like that's

9768.96 --> 9776.279999999999
a massive World shattering change if if

9773.399 --> 9778.14
Christ actually came by and did his

9776.28 --> 9780.5
thing

9778.14 --> 9782.96
a thousand years later

9780.5 --> 9786.479
huge influence

9782.96 --> 9788.58
huge difference the rollout of things

9786.479 --> 9791.66
would have been different and it seems

9788.58 --> 9791.66
like it is

9796.979 --> 9803.22
right just think about it if Jesus

9799.74 --> 9806.939
Christ was actually born in zero A.D

9803.22 --> 9810.3
right something like that

9806.939 --> 9813.02
than Medieval Times

9810.3 --> 9816.858999999999
it would never be super Christian

9813.02 --> 9820.859
inspired this is a thousand years later

9816.859 --> 9820.859
a thousand

9820.92 --> 9826.38
there's no [ __ ] way that Europe's

9823.08 --> 9827.16
gonna be all Christian and all that no

9826.38 --> 9831.0
way

9827.16 --> 9834.96
look at us now and consider that Jesus

9831.0 --> 9838.5
was a thousand years ago how it's being

9834.96 --> 9841.979
dealt with now is much more logical

9838.5 --> 9844.92
then how Medieval Europe was about

9841.979 --> 9847.438999999998
Christ and a supposed thousand years

9844.92 --> 9850.2
later after Christ

9847.439 --> 9851.7
how we are dealing with it now is much

9850.2 --> 9854.04
more logical

9851.7 --> 9855.6
to have a thousand years in between the

9854.04 --> 9857.819000000001
figure

9855.6 --> 9862.08
wouldn't you say

9857.819 --> 9863.939
water down confuse people against much

9862.08 --> 9865.38
more pronounced much more tolerated

9863.939 --> 9869.880000000001
against it

9865.38 --> 9872.22
in medieval times no no

9869.88 --> 9875.46
it would be highly fanatical about it

9872.22 --> 9877.619999999999
yeah you don't have a highly fanatical

9875.46 --> 9881.3
religious people

9877.62 --> 9885.960000000001
if the person that spurred that religion

9881.3 --> 9888.56
died a thousand years ago that's not

9885.96 --> 9888.56
logical

9888.899 --> 9895.16
I bet you never even thought of that

9891.78 --> 9895.16
anybody who's listening

9900.96 --> 9909.119999999999
do you put the ability to do the longer

9904.859 --> 9912.0
shows down to no alcohol and Gusto well

9909.12 --> 9915.660000000002
no alcohol probably does help yeah

9912.0 --> 9916.68
borders boy Elko was a drain on me and I

9915.66 --> 9919.14
mean I've

9916.68 --> 9920.819
been very open about it since January I

9919.14 --> 9924.96
stopped and

9920.819 --> 9928.68
I felt a lot better pretty quickly too

9924.96 --> 9931.74
but yes it has definitely contributed to

9928.68 --> 9935.34
my ability to do longer shows

9931.74 --> 9937.979
and to be more stable and more fun

9935.34 --> 9940.56
having more fun even doing the show like

9937.979 --> 9943.858999999999
yes they had a lot of fun

9940.56 --> 9945.72
right yeah the alcohol seven seven set

9943.859 --> 9948.5
certainly has something to do with it

9945.72 --> 9952.38
Gusto energy drink

9948.5 --> 9954.3
meh a bit you see I have a good strategy

9952.38 --> 9956.759999999998
drink I haven't drunken it because

9954.3 --> 9959.16
I just don't feel like it right now but

9956.76 --> 9961.800000000001
I mean in the days like yesterday or the

9959.16 --> 9965.58
day before when it's like very hot like

9961.8 --> 9966.84
really hot then it's like whoa what a

9965.58 --> 9969.24
difference

9966.84 --> 9971.04
but it's really for the hot days that it

9969.24 --> 9973.319
really makes a difference

9971.04 --> 9976.140000000001
so I wouldn't really attribute it to the

9973.319 --> 9979.76
Gusto drink but the no alcohol yes

9976.14 --> 9982.199999999999
definitely has been a positive influence

9979.76 --> 9985.399
yeah I didn't need it

9982.2 --> 9985.399000000001
I just didn't need it

9986.64 --> 9991.858999999999
just like I had it here but it's like

9988.62 --> 9994.68
yeah no don't feel like getting it no

9991.859 --> 9997.74
why why would I I mean

9994.68 --> 10001.04
I just saved myself like

9997.74 --> 10002.18
two Euros not drinking it so I'm like

10001.04 --> 10003.859
yeah

10002.18 --> 10006.319
I mean I'm not gonna drink it just

10003.859 --> 10008.24
because I I got it from the fridge I'm

10006.319 --> 10009.74
gonna drink it when I feel like drinking

10008.24 --> 10013.3
it and if I don't feel like drinking it

10009.74 --> 10013.3
well I just save myself some money

10015.319 --> 10020.319
do I get most of my exercise riding bike

10025.16 --> 10028.119999999999
yeah I do

10028.819 --> 10032.66
and it's like an old it's a very old

10031.399 --> 10035.66
bike it's

10032.66 --> 10038.78
it's kind of I have to put like twice in

10035.66 --> 10041.3
the effort as as a new bike to get it

10038.78 --> 10043.220000000001
going so yeah it's it's kind of tiresome

10041.3 --> 10044.539999999999
riding that thing but I mean I just use

10043.22 --> 10046.16
it as a sport

10044.54 --> 10049.160000000002
it's like oh it's tiresome I should get

10046.16 --> 10051.76
it fixed or I could just use the extra

10049.16 --> 10051.76
training

10052.16 --> 10058.28
and not spend money on getting it fixed

10056.56 --> 10059.779999999999
win-win

10058.28 --> 10062.12
sort of

10059.78 --> 10064.16
I mean eventually it's going to get two

10062.12 --> 10068.26
tiresome

10064.16 --> 10068.26
or it's gonna break or something so

10069.56 --> 10074.779999999999
I would like to see my bike really my

10072.68 --> 10076.220000000001
bike is [ __ ] though

10074.78 --> 10079.880000000001
two bikes

10076.22 --> 10083.66
cool well mine is [ __ ] it's ugly it's

10079.88 --> 10086.0
broken it doesn't even have a lamp on it

10083.66 --> 10088.76
all right has a lamp but no wiring to it

10086.0 --> 10090.8
like the thing it looks like trash it

10088.76 --> 10093.5
has rust on it

10090.8 --> 10097.46
the paint is chipping it's like terrible

10093.5 --> 10100.1
but I like it that way because no person

10097.46 --> 10101.179999999998
in the world will ever try to steal this

10100.1 --> 10103.76
bike

10101.18 --> 10106.64
there's no way they'll do that and

10103.76 --> 10108.92
that's exactly what I want

10106.64 --> 10110.119999999999
I'd want it to look [ __ ] because then I

10108.92 --> 10113.319
don't have to worry that somebody's

10110.12 --> 10113.319000000001
gonna steal it at some point

10116.72 --> 10118.84
um

10119.899 --> 10123.619999999999
if I had to walk how long does it take

10122.0 --> 10126.38
long

10123.62 --> 10127.240000000002
like that's annoyingly that like that's

10126.38 --> 10129.38
like

10127.24 --> 10131.06
at least

10129.38 --> 10132.74
half an hour

10131.06 --> 10135.439
walking

10132.74 --> 10137.96
back half an hour and

10135.439 --> 10139.28
and fourth half an hour like no no

10137.96 --> 10141.438999999998
thanks

10139.28 --> 10142.819000000001
walking is very tedious

10141.439 --> 10145.1
to the store

10142.819 --> 10148.1
especially having to carry all that

10145.1 --> 10150.380000000001
stuff on the way back

10148.1 --> 10153.08
so

10150.38 --> 10155.438999999998
no I definitely prefer to use the

10153.08 --> 10155.439
bicycle

10159.02 --> 10164.08
30 minutes

10161.6 --> 10164.08
yeah

10165.74 --> 10170.119999999999
maybe less

10167.359 --> 10171.979000000001
if I'm like really energetic if I have a

10170.12 --> 10175.52
Gusto drink while I'm walking then I

10171.979 --> 10178.039999999999
might like get it in 20 or 25 minutes

10175.52 --> 10180.26
but yeah

10178.04 --> 10182.0
if not it's probably gonna take half an

10180.26 --> 10184.64
hour I don't I don't want to walk there

10182.0 --> 10187.28
I mean the only reason I ever even done

10184.64 --> 10190.939
that is because

10187.28 --> 10192.62
when it was like really snowed in and

10190.939 --> 10194.84
there was ice everywhere and it's just

10192.62 --> 10197.18
like I'm not gonna risk going on my

10194.84 --> 10199.1
bicycle and like basically hurting

10197.18 --> 10200.479000000001
myself falling over all the time so I'm

10199.1 --> 10202.640000000001
just gonna walk

10200.479 --> 10205.84
and those are really the only times I

10202.64 --> 10205.84
walk to the grocery store

10207.26 --> 10210.26
and that's happened

10208.819 --> 10213.439
like

10210.26 --> 10215.66
I think like four or five times since I

10213.439 --> 10219.220000000001
moved in here

10215.66 --> 10219.22
so not that many times

10220.64 --> 10223.119999999999
anyway

10223.46 --> 10229.039999999999
yeah rounding out the show now

10225.979 --> 10231.199999999999
almost hitting the three hours

10229.04 --> 10233.660000000002
but I am I'm really gonna run out now

10241.52 --> 10246.92
