days without and it's actually been

133.84 --> 137.599
quite

134.56 --> 140.48
good without it although yeah it did

137.599 --> 143.92
feel like a bit slow but yeah my jaw

140.48 --> 147.2
has healed up great i think

143.92 --> 149.11999999999998
and i'm gonna test that out by taking

147.2 --> 157.83999999999997
some tumeric coffee again let's see what

149.12 --> 157.84
that it'll do

161.04 --> 167.04

163.84 --> 167.04
grapefruit juice with me

168.959 --> 176.879

right just so weird how it works in

176.879 --> 182.64
youtube

178.48 --> 186.64
i did actually change it

182.64 --> 188.72
in the like the editor setting

186.64 --> 190.07999999999998
but then it just shows the yesterday's

188.72 --> 191.84
title anyway

190.08 --> 194.48000000000002
it did that yesterday as well it's kind

191.84 --> 194.48
of annoying

194.879 --> 201.92
all right

199.44 --> 203.68
so let's see who's in chat okay traffic

201.92 --> 205.83999999999997
camera rest ahead

203.68 --> 207.59900000000002

224.84 --> 227.84
what

230.48 --> 235.319
no no i don't know where you're getting

232.48 --> 237.319
this yesterday's show 22 hours ago was

235.319 --> 241.67999999999998
661 the day before

237.319 --> 246.319
660 and it's now 662.

241.68 --> 255.84
so now

246.319 --> 255.83999999999997
it's here

258.479 --> 262.0
and youtube crashed again

262.24 --> 269.84000000000003
or yeah firefox

265.44 --> 269.84
right so uh

271.44 --> 274.96
i've been doing all kinds of things

275.199 --> 279.91900000000004
oh damn it i completely forgot to make

277.28 --> 284.32
notes stupid

279.919 --> 286.4
just to quickly scrape that together

284.32 --> 288.639
i don't think there was a owen benjamin

286.4 --> 296.23999999999995
live yesterday

288.639 --> 299.04
or i forgot about it

296.24 --> 299.68
oh yeah there was a rodrigo ferrari

299.04 --> 302.96000000000004
nunez

299.68 --> 304.8
hangout again another spacecrack i was

302.96 --> 307.52
kind of late though i did remember that

304.8 --> 308.88
and i even went on to his onto the

307.52 --> 312.08
discord

308.88 --> 312.8
talk to with him for a few like after

312.08 --> 317.12
two hours

312.8 --> 317.12
of his show it lasted three hours

320.639 --> 324.08
i'm just talking about masks actually

322.72 --> 328.72
and i was really tired

324.08 --> 328.71999999999997
by that time i just wanted to try it out

337.039 --> 356.8
what else is going on

352.72 --> 356.8
yeah that's about it yeah this morning

357.039 --> 360.479
i got up kind of late

361.28 --> 366.55999999999995
and then i basically went out for

362.96 --> 368.96
groceries including getting the coffee

366.56 --> 370.0
and then when i got back i barely had

368.96 --> 371.59999999999997
half an hour to

370.0 --> 373.52
get ready for everything so that's why

371.6 --> 374.639
i'm late five minutes surprised it's

373.52 --> 381.84
only five minutes

374.639 --> 381.84000000000003
really hey agm

394.4 --> 400.08
all right man it was odd yesterday i was

397.919 --> 404.71999999999997
watching

400.08 --> 409.35999999999996
uh alex jones and all that

404.72 --> 413.199
and also yeah his show and

409.36 --> 415.68
some of owen schroeder show

413.199 --> 417.12
the war room and it was like all in the

415.68 --> 420.479
theme of basically

417.12 --> 424.08
yeah some core black lives matters

420.479 --> 427.039
being just pure witches like

424.08 --> 429.039
yeah the problem is with the word even

427.039 --> 429.84
but like satanic which is like really

429.039 --> 433.68
bad and

429.84 --> 437.919
just some horrifying [ __ ] going on

433.68 --> 440.319
and yeah way back like 20 years ago

437.919 --> 442.31899999999996
i think i also met a couple of these

440.319 --> 445.599
people

442.319 --> 447.44
and like i was like in my wicca face

445.599 --> 450.319
sort of so i

447.44 --> 452.96
i had kind of a blind eye to to part of

450.319 --> 452.96000000000004
the darkness

453.36 --> 456.56
i was still like trying to figure out

455.28 --> 459.75899999999996
morality in a way

456.56 --> 461.199
yeah so it was but i did meet some of

459.759 --> 463.68
these people and they

461.199 --> 466.56
would kind of like profess that they are

463.68 --> 470.08
like really dark witches and [ __ ] and

466.56 --> 472.4
i just i didn't know what to think of it

470.08 --> 474.15999999999997
i thought it was insane

472.4 --> 475.919
but i didn't really understand the

474.16 --> 476.72
implications i would just basically

475.919 --> 479.12
respond like

476.72 --> 481.199
okay well you know what's gonna happen

479.12 --> 483.199
in the end

481.199 --> 486.56
i don't know because that's something

483.199 --> 488.879
that i would typically say

486.56 --> 490.319
if people thought it was a great idea to

488.879 --> 494.40000000000003
like basically

490.319 --> 494.40000000000003
double down on absolute evil

495.52 --> 499.19899999999996
and that way i could have could kind of

497.759 --> 501.759
keep my

499.199 --> 504.8
feelings at a distance from that so that

501.759 --> 508.16
i didn't get so triggered

504.8 --> 510.96000000000004
back then that was kind of required

508.16 --> 510.96000000000004
to get around

512.24 --> 521.76
yeah but yeah it was all in the theme

515.68 --> 523.68
yesterday and yeah that was

521.76 --> 525.04
in a way it was kind of on target but

523.68 --> 528.2399999999999
i'm also thinking about

525.04 --> 531.8389999999999
the wider like the aftermath

528.24 --> 535.2
implications of such things

531.839 --> 539.2790000000001
in this time

535.2 --> 539.279
so yeah just puzzled about it but

540.32 --> 545.519
technically i did agree they were also

542.32 --> 548.5600000000001
getting like very angry about it

545.519 --> 552.72
and i've uttered similar sympathies

548.56 --> 557.5189999999999
just burn him to the stake

552.72 --> 562.72
sounds really brutal right well yeah

557.519 --> 566.16
but in the face face of such evil

562.72 --> 568.24
such like mind-blowing mind-altering

566.16 --> 572.959
level of evil

568.24 --> 575.6800000000001
sometimes yeah it's almost like you just

572.959 --> 578.959
i don't even want to say that you know

575.68 --> 583.12
it's just like a deterrent

578.959 --> 587.5999999999999
like that frequency just has to know

583.12 --> 591.519
that it yeah it's not welcome here

587.6 --> 594.8000000000001
it's not safe for that

591.519 --> 596.64
in this world it has to know

594.8 --> 599.12
if it doesn't get to know that then

596.64 --> 600.48
eventually others will also start doing

599.12 --> 604.24
that

600.48 --> 607.839
because it for them it can be

604.24 --> 610.88
normalized can be part of the new normal

607.839 --> 613.6
unless it is severely deterred

610.88 --> 615.2
and yeah severe deterrence usually

613.6 --> 619.12
requires

615.2 --> 622.0
brutality so anyway

619.12 --> 622.0
enough about that

626.8 --> 630.079
these types of things are not the types

628.48 --> 630.88
of things i just want to talk about all

630.079 --> 634.64
day long

630.88 --> 634.64
because it's just so dark

635.68 --> 650.4799999999999
but it is happening out there

647.36 --> 650.48
a tiny wimble

654.959 --> 658.8389999999999
yeah it was an interesting situation

656.8 --> 660.079
yesterday with you tiny wumbo and the

658.839 --> 664.0790000000001
whole

660.079 --> 664.079
atmosphere in the moon situation

664.88 --> 671.2
like at one point i was kind of annoyed

668.0 --> 672.8
like you're being nitpicky but afterward

671.2 --> 676.0790000000001
i kind of realized

672.8 --> 679.76
and you made that clear that

676.079 --> 683.279
yeah apparently in that article

679.76 --> 683.519
it's it's basically kind of like a bluff

683.279 --> 686.0
or

683.519 --> 686.72
an over exaggeration it's not even

686.0 --> 688.72
really some

686.72 --> 690.48
supposed to be something real it's just

688.72 --> 693.2
a suggestion

690.48 --> 694.9590000000001
that the data they present doesn't

693.2 --> 696.6400000000001
reflect even

694.959 --> 700.0
that's really that kind of weirded me

696.64 --> 702.959
out i feel like even though i know

700.0 --> 704.56
nasa is always trying to trick everyone

702.959 --> 706.2399999999999
i kind of fell for that trick

704.56 --> 708.079
it was just not a type of trick that i

706.24 --> 711.6800000000001
was expecting

708.079 --> 711.68
but i should be expecting that

714.839 --> 734.48
anyway how's chat still working

731.2 --> 736.639
i was okay about it well you it it

734.48 --> 745.839
really the tone started to piss me off

736.639 --> 745.839
you were using

746.639 --> 748.9590000000001
what

750.48 --> 754.72
found a skateboard painted by math power

753.2 --> 759.839
land it was sold out

754.72 --> 759.839
okay didn't know he did he did that

783.76 --> 787.8389999999999
right anyway uh

794.16 --> 799.4399999999999
yeah anything specific i yeah i got

797.2 --> 801.2
through the list pretty quick

799.44 --> 803.6
because i don't really remember most

801.2 --> 805.519
that i was doing

803.6 --> 807.0400000000001
i could take my time to try and remember

805.519 --> 810.399
it because yeah i

807.04 --> 815.8389999999999
i don't just sit still and do nothing

810.399 --> 815.839
usually watch stuff

822.88 --> 826.16
but yeah you know a lot of what i watch

825.36 --> 829.279
is just

826.16 --> 832.48
snippet little videos or like

829.279 --> 836.24
silly review videos that

832.48 --> 836.24
yeah nobody really cares about that

838.56 --> 846.16
let me just look

842.639 --> 846.16
all right nope

849.6 --> 854.88
anything all right i think there might

853.519 --> 856.639
have been a kiwi alive

854.88 --> 859.279
but i also missed that if it was

856.639 --> 859.279
actually live

860.959 --> 871.8389999999999
i'm still just hanging back

872.8 --> 875.92
because i don't know i don't need a bit

874.56 --> 879.76
of a break i'm just

875.92 --> 885.8389999999999
not active a lot

879.76 --> 885.8389999999999
i feel like mentally exhausted

890.079 --> 899.8389999999999
physically i'm doing okay now

908.32 --> 913.839
a penguin chopping a globe with a

910.839 --> 913.839
chainsaw

919.199 --> 927.8389999999999
okay that's special

938.839 --> 941.839
um

942.639 --> 944.9590000000001
right

945.92 --> 952.4799999999999
yeah amanda young well

949.68 --> 956.16
the thing is watching new [ __ ] you know

952.48 --> 959.279
like in 2015 16 even 17

956.16 --> 961.36
i would be scouring for what for new

959.279 --> 961.759
videos because there was just so much

961.36 --> 965.12
new

961.759 --> 968.0790000000001
information out there for me to

965.12 --> 968.639
that i wanted to learn that i wanted to

968.079 --> 972.7199999999999
touch

968.639 --> 976.32
upon just to see it

972.72 --> 978.5600000000001
now nowadays there yeah there's not a

976.32 --> 980.88
lot of new things

978.56 --> 982.88
things that i can bump into that i'll be

980.88 --> 984.16
like oh okay that's something i haven't

982.88 --> 987.04
heard of

984.16 --> 987.8389999999999
it's extremely rare nowadays and if it

987.04 --> 990.56
is

987.839 --> 991.12
actually something new it's usually very

990.56 --> 992.959
niche

991.12 --> 995.04
a niche detail that has been like

992.959 --> 996.399
overlooked in an earlier project or

995.04 --> 1000.48
something

996.399 --> 1000.48
and yeah it's just not the same

1002.16 --> 1006.7199999999999
and hey i've been doing my show for two

1005.279 --> 1009.199
years

1006.72 --> 1011.839
almost every day especially last year

1009.199 --> 1011.8389999999999
just every day

1012.16 --> 1016.8
and i yeah i think i do like need a a

1015.199 --> 1019.04
vacation break where i

1016.8 --> 1020.4799999999999
i kind of like completely step away from

1019.04 --> 1022.48
the computer and media

1020.48 --> 1024.079
but have to yeah i have to have

1022.48 --> 1027.1200000000001
something i would be

1024.079 --> 1027.12
doing instead

1027.679 --> 1031.8390000000002
otherwise i just slip back to my

1029.28 --> 1035.28
computer again

1031.839 --> 1037.9189999999999
but yeah a good long break from media

1035.28 --> 1040.24
from literally information input from

1037.919 --> 1042.7990000000002
the outside

1040.24 --> 1044.64
like i i do i'm starting to feel a

1042.799 --> 1046.8799999999999
longing for it like i do really need a

1044.64 --> 1049.2800000000002
break

1046.88 --> 1051.2800000000002
but yeah i don't know when that's gonna

1049.28 --> 1053.2
happen

1051.28 --> 1057.36
so i'm just taking it a little bit more

1053.2 --> 1057.3600000000001
easy than i have in like the last month

1063.2 --> 1070.48
yeah and indeed amanda young like the

1066.48 --> 1070.48
things on youtube now overall

1070.64 --> 1077.2800000000002
like a lot of flat earth things

1073.84 --> 1079.6789999999999
five years ago were like really pure

1077.28 --> 1082.16
and spontaneously conceived and just

1079.679 --> 1084.64
born from pure curiosity

1082.16 --> 1086.799
now what's going around it's everything

1084.64 --> 1090.4
is there's all these

1086.799 --> 1092.24
narratives and agendas happening

1090.4 --> 1094.0800000000002
not necessarily even to do with flat

1092.24 --> 1097.44
earth and they all

1094.08 --> 1099.36
just put their roots into our territory

1097.44 --> 1101.6000000000001
and now everybody's also talking about

1099.36 --> 1101.6
that

1107.52 --> 1111.84
so yeah the flat earth is not really the

1110.4 --> 1114.4
flat earth anymore because

1111.84 --> 1116.24
yeah not like five years we're not just

1114.4 --> 1118.799
constantly talking about flat earth

1116.24 --> 1118.799
non-stop

1120.4 --> 1126.88
like i'm for example surprised that

1123.84 --> 1129.4399999999998
shows like glow busters

1126.88 --> 1129.919
and what jiren does you know that used

1129.44 --> 1134.3200000000002
to be

1129.919 --> 1137.8400000000001
100 flat earth every single time

1134.32 --> 1137.84
and now it's just no

1140.24 --> 1144.72
every time i i check in to just see what

1142.88 --> 1145.6000000000001
they're talking it's usually not flat

1144.72 --> 1147.6000000000001
earth

1145.6 --> 1149.1999999999998
and now i'm kind of guilty of that as

1147.6 --> 1151.52
well but i do

1149.2 --> 1155.2
really try to discuss flat earth and

1151.52 --> 1159.76
even like engage globe believers

1155.2 --> 1159.76
in chat so at least try

1160.799 --> 1164.559
but yeah the issue with the flat earth

1162.96 --> 1167.28
is of course

1164.559 --> 1167.84
information saturation so much has just

1167.28 --> 1168.8799999999999
been done

1167.84 --> 1171.12
has been put out there there's

1168.88 --> 1174.0800000000002
misinformation but people

1171.12 --> 1174.8799999999999
will figure it out or be misled it's out

1174.08 --> 1177.6789999999999
there

1174.88 --> 1178.0
eventually those who want to know how it

1177.679 --> 1179.919
really

1178.0 --> 1181.919
works we'll figure it out with what's

1179.919 --> 1186.0
there

1181.919 --> 1188.4
and yeah

1186.0 --> 1190.0
the globers just don't have anything not

1188.4 --> 1193.1200000000001
really

1190.0 --> 1194.799
they got a lot of broken arguments and

1193.12 --> 1197.1999999999998
beliefs and hopes for

1194.799 --> 1199.36
what might be that's basically what's

1197.2 --> 1200.64
left it's what it always was

1199.36 --> 1202.7199999999998
you know the whole thing is a

1200.64 --> 1208.48
presuppositional religion

1202.72 --> 1208.48
a a colossal what if structure

1211.36 --> 1215.36
but yeah a giant mine experiment and

1214.159 --> 1220.4
yeah there's just

1215.36 --> 1222.24
there's structures to explain things but

1220.4 --> 1224.24
yeah there's just not a lot of real

1222.24 --> 1225.84
arguments no real proof for it in the

1224.24 --> 1234.799
physical world

1225.84 --> 1236.799
with with physical empirical data

1234.799 --> 1238.48
now tom parker they're not strict of the

1236.799 --> 1240.72
mask here at all

1238.48 --> 1243.2
it's it's been generally recognized i

1240.72 --> 1245.039
think that is just not useful

1243.2 --> 1246.64
and even though some people are still

1245.039 --> 1248.4
sticking to it

1246.64 --> 1250.88
they're sticking to it probably more

1248.4 --> 1253.679
because of some social responsibility

1250.88 --> 1254.72
feelings that have been dropped onto

1253.679 --> 1257.039
them

1254.72 --> 1258.559
that they can latch on and they did

1257.039 --> 1260.8799999999999
probably because they're societally

1258.559 --> 1263.28
frustrated

1260.88 --> 1264.4
and they're still doing it but nobody

1263.28 --> 1267.9189999999999
really has to

1264.4 --> 1270.799
although i think that some type of line

1267.919 --> 1271.6000000000001
some lines of work are they are trying

1270.799 --> 1274.6399999999999
to force it

1271.6 --> 1277.039
upon certain professions

1274.64 --> 1279.3600000000001
which is absurd it's it's really

1277.039 --> 1281.44
embarrassing

1279.36 --> 1283.6
yeah it's humiliating it's not

1281.44 --> 1286.24
embarrassing it's humiliating

1283.6 --> 1287.6
and it should all stop all of it should

1286.24 --> 1290.799
really stop but

1287.6 --> 1292.3999999999999
yeah there's there's no people being

1290.799 --> 1294.32
shoved on the ground and

1292.4 --> 1296.0
mistreated by police because they're not

1294.32 --> 1296.799
wearing a mask or that sort of thing i

1296.0 --> 1301.76
haven't seen

1296.799 --> 1304.96
any of that here like maybe

1301.76 --> 1307.039
in like in hague or rotterdam

1304.96 --> 1308.0
i have heard that there are some even

1307.039 --> 1311.2
quarantine

1308.0 --> 1312.72
places there but that's

1311.2 --> 1315.1200000000001
yeah i've never seen it because i

1312.72 --> 1316.159
haven't been there i haven't seen a lot

1315.12 --> 1318.3999999999999
of footage that

1316.159 --> 1320.88
just made me think whoa this is like in

1318.4 --> 1323.1200000000001
victoria australia or something

1320.88 --> 1323.1200000000001
no

1325.039 --> 1328.48
but supposedly there is some [ __ ] going

1328.08 --> 1330.1589999999999
down

1328.48 --> 1331.6
with quarantines and all that in the

1330.159 --> 1335.6000000000001
netherlands

1331.6 --> 1337.9189999999999
but not that i've been confronted with

1335.6 --> 1339.84
you have to still wear masks if in

1337.919 --> 1341.679
public transport which is completely

1339.84 --> 1343.6789999999999
idiotic

1341.679 --> 1345.52
especially because apparently yeah the

1343.679 --> 1347.919
bus drivers and all they don't have to

1345.52 --> 1350.799
wear a mask which is good by the way

1347.919 --> 1352.48
because any reason to not wear a mask is

1350.799 --> 1354.4
always a good reason doesn't matter what

1352.48 --> 1356.4
it is

1354.4 --> 1358.5590000000002
you know and that stupid peer pressure

1356.4 --> 1360.3200000000002
feeling but we have to wear a mask why

1358.559 --> 1362.96
doesn't he have to wear a mask

1360.32 --> 1364.48
that's actually the bad response that's

1362.96 --> 1366.4
just stupid

1364.48 --> 1368.32
like you shouldn't be wearing a mask and

1366.4 --> 1368.96
the person not wearing a mask in front

1368.32 --> 1371.36
of the bus

1368.96 --> 1372.88
should not be enforcing wearing a mask

1371.36 --> 1376.1589999999999
he should just

1372.88 --> 1377.2800000000002
rebel against it just not enforce it at

1376.159 --> 1380.5590000000002
all

1377.28 --> 1380.559
that's what they should be doing

1380.96 --> 1386.159
because yeah at some point you know

1384.32 --> 1388.0
like the whole company is just gonna

1386.159 --> 1390.3200000000002
collapse in on itself

1388.0 --> 1392.799
the amount of people that used public

1390.32 --> 1395.84
transport has been decreasing

1392.799 --> 1399.52
dramatically dramatically

1395.84 --> 1401.84
okay so yeah they're supposedly a

1399.52 --> 1405.12
privatized company

1401.84 --> 1406.72
working for the state well

1405.12 --> 1408.4799999999998
if they're just going to collapse in on

1406.72 --> 1409.28
itself because of this stupid corona

1408.48 --> 1413.1200000000001
measure that

1409.28 --> 1417.84
literally nobody wants then yeah

1413.12 --> 1417.84
that's going to be their problem

1422.799 --> 1430.4
finds that's bizarre

1427.36 --> 1432.7199999999998
i haven't heard of finds before but you

1430.4 --> 1435.919
know the thing is with fines

1432.72 --> 1438.559
you can that's all fine and dandy

1435.919 --> 1440.72
but like i would just wouldn't even show

1438.559 --> 1443.2
my identity i wouldn't say who i was

1440.72 --> 1444.799
it's like oh really you're gonna find me

1443.2 --> 1447.1200000000001
that's really nice

1444.799 --> 1448.24
yeah you gave me that piece of paper and

1447.12 --> 1450.6399999999999
now i'm gonna go

1448.24 --> 1453.279
bye and then i'm gonna throw it in the

1450.64 --> 1453.279
trash can

1453.6 --> 1459.84
and they're not gonna know who i am and

1455.2 --> 1459.8400000000001
they're not yeah screw that

1462.799 --> 1469.12
you know especially like

1465.919 --> 1469.1200000000001
if they're not even police

1469.679 --> 1473.8400000000001
they can't even ask for my id

1480.64 --> 1486.64
right but anyway i don't wear a mask i

1482.559 --> 1489.44
don't have a mask i don't care i'm not

1486.64 --> 1491.8400000000001
i'm just not gonna go anywhere through

1489.44 --> 1494.88
public transport i got a bike

1491.84 --> 1495.6
it's good enough it's a very shitty

1494.88 --> 1497.6000000000001
looking

1495.6 --> 1500.48
rattly bike so i don't think anyone is

1497.6 --> 1504.0
gonna steal it

1500.48 --> 1507.52
i got a lock on it and yeah i'll just

1504.0 --> 1509.76
i'm just doing fine with that

1507.52 --> 1511.279
and if i really need to get out of here

1509.76 --> 1514.4
i could always basically

1511.279 --> 1515.44
hire a car it's not super cheap but i

1514.4 --> 1517.1200000000001
could

1515.44 --> 1519.6000000000001
because i do still have my driver's

1517.12 --> 1519.6
license

1526.96 --> 1534.799
ah oh it's good to have some coffee back

1532.88 --> 1537.7600000000002
i can really feel it here in the front

1534.799 --> 1537.76
of my face a lot

1540.84 --> 1545.039
hmm

1542.72 --> 1547.3600000000001
it does kind of help me focus a little

1545.039 --> 1547.36
better

1547.76 --> 1552.24
uh this is like the first one by the way

1550.72 --> 1553.039
it's not like i had a coffee in the

1552.24 --> 1556.08
morning

1553.039 --> 1558.559
so this is my first coffee

1556.08 --> 1558.559
it's good

1560.0 --> 1565.52
let hope it stays good

1563.12 --> 1565.52
anyway

1568.32 --> 1572.799
all right i think that oh oh yeah yeah i

1571.6 --> 1574.32
know i remember i had a good

1572.799 --> 1576.96
conversation with

1574.32 --> 1578.24
the same girl again on the balcony

1576.96 --> 1581.1200000000001
friend

1578.24 --> 1581.919
that i kind of talked elaborately about

1581.12 --> 1586.08
academics

1581.919 --> 1588.5590000000002
last time she's a real cutie

1586.08 --> 1589.1999999999998
i think she kind of likes me but i think

1588.559 --> 1590.72
she also

1589.2 --> 1592.32
might think that she's actually a

1590.72 --> 1597.279
lesbian or something

1592.32 --> 1599.6789999999999
bisexual i don't know saw some things

1597.279 --> 1601.84
not too extreme but just details that i

1599.679 --> 1601.8400000000001
thought

1602.159 --> 1606.0800000000002
it would make sense though she going

1604.88 --> 1610.88
around with

1606.08 --> 1610.8799999999999
yeah her who is a professed lesbian so

1611.279 --> 1614.48
yeah a good female might be tougher to

1613.52 --> 1616.6399999999999
find or

1614.48 --> 1618.799
or it's just not really what it is you

1616.64 --> 1624.4
know sometimes i think this whole

1618.799 --> 1624.4
oh i'm lesbian it's more like a

1625.44 --> 1629.279
like a group designation sometimes i

1628.88 --> 1631.2
think

1629.279 --> 1633.12
it's like okay that means that other

1631.2 --> 1634.96
people that do that you can hang around

1633.12 --> 1635.4399999999998
with and you could potentially fool

1634.96 --> 1639.1200000000001
around

1635.44 --> 1642.3990000000001
with it if you feel like it

1639.12 --> 1645.6
but i don't think they're yeah they it's

1642.399 --> 1645.6
not the same as like

1650.24 --> 1655.84
oh yeah what do you even call that like

1652.48 --> 1655.84
original lesbians

1656.08 --> 1659.6
i don't know lesbians that i've

1660.559 --> 1663.84
heard about by the way through my mother

1662.72 --> 1666.32
and everything

1663.84 --> 1667.6789999999999
in the music scene from way back that

1666.32 --> 1670.559
just

1667.679 --> 1670.5590000000002
like really

1670.88 --> 1676.3200000000002
didn't feel anything about men like they

1674.159 --> 1679.5200000000002
had no

1676.32 --> 1682.72
emotional feelings towards them

1679.52 --> 1683.52
that's different like those are i don't

1682.72 --> 1687.1200000000001
know those are

1683.52 --> 1690.24
i guess real lesbians i have

1687.12 --> 1692.7199999999998
i don't know man i'm not even a woman i

1690.24 --> 1694.32
i'm basically grasping at straws here as

1692.72 --> 1696.799
to

1694.32 --> 1698.96
how to define it it's just that it seems

1696.799 --> 1701.52
so normalized

1698.96 --> 1702.159
that i think that a lot of girls are

1701.52 --> 1704.24
just

1702.159 --> 1705.679
getting in between there and they're not

1704.24 --> 1709.84
actually

1705.679 --> 1711.2
really lesbian it's just the thing now

1709.84 --> 1714.799
and they get it

1711.2 --> 1718.96
and they don't have any objections

1714.799 --> 1718.96
through i don't know religious things or

1722.84 --> 1726.399
whatever

1724.24 --> 1728.799
although you never see yeah lesbian

1726.399 --> 1731.84
groups hang around with muslim girls

1728.799 --> 1733.679
that's something i've noticed well in

1731.84 --> 1736.8799999999999
the past i kind of have seen it

1733.679 --> 1739.1200000000001
although yeah that's probably different

1736.88 --> 1740.159
because i have seen like muslim girls

1739.12 --> 1744.0
hang around with

1740.159 --> 1746.5590000000002
more social justice warrior types

1744.0 --> 1747.52
or leftist types so she just is a big

1746.559 --> 1750.32
word you know

1747.52 --> 1753.84
they're not necessarily completely in

1750.32 --> 1753.84
the nutty way

1754.159 --> 1760.0800000000002
but yeah man

1757.44 --> 1762.559
just the world out there the people it

1760.08 --> 1766.0
confuses the [ __ ] out of me sometimes

1762.559 --> 1770.0
anyway hey julia of heaven sent you

1766.0 --> 1781.84
coffee money thank you for the 2

1770.0 --> 1781.84
super chat donation

1784.399 --> 1789.12
whoa damn that's a lot of coffee money

1787.36 --> 1792.84
julie of heaven

1789.12 --> 1795.279
thank you for the paypal donation

1792.84 --> 1799.36
oh

1795.279 --> 1801.84
this is very very welcome very welcome

1799.36 --> 1801.84
indeed

1802.08 --> 1809.84
yeah saving my hide

1811.6 --> 1814.48
thank you very much

1818.64 --> 1822.7990000000002
they just like saying it yeah yeah stop

1821.52 --> 1826.1589999999999
traffic arrest had also

1822.799 --> 1828.48
that and also i think

1826.159 --> 1829.2
it's just a standardized tactic now to

1828.48 --> 1832.3990000000001
say

1829.2 --> 1835.76
now i'm a lesbian like if a guy is

1832.399 --> 1837.9189999999999
interested in them and they don't want

1835.76 --> 1841.279
them to basically chase after them

1837.919 --> 1841.279
they just say i'm a lesbian

1844.64 --> 1847.76
that's happened before

1849.039 --> 1854.24
and sometimes they are and sometimes

1854.48 --> 1858.72
it's just that i make them nervous or

1862.84 --> 1866.559
something

1864.159 --> 1869.2
like i've had that where i would just be

1866.559 --> 1870.8799999999999
like standing there and be like hey

1869.2 --> 1872.559
just my stance would be like yeah i

1870.88 --> 1874.0
think you're kind of cute

1872.559 --> 1875.6
and i'm not going to be all super

1874.0 --> 1876.399
dominant right and then it would be like

1875.6 --> 1878.6399999999999
uh yeah yeah

1876.399 --> 1880.6399999999999
i'm a lesbian by the way or they would

1878.64 --> 1882.0800000000002
start talking about their girlfriends

1880.64 --> 1893.8400000000001
all of a sudden and be like

1882.08 --> 1893.84
okay i guess i'll step away again

1899.44 --> 1905.279
yeah i i think that back in the day

1902.559 --> 1906.799
it would be more normal that that whim

1905.279 --> 1907.919
girls would just say that they had a

1906.799 --> 1911.12
boyfriend

1907.919 --> 1911.1200000000001
even even if they didn't

1913.279 --> 1916.88
cool i'm a lesbian too no

1917.6 --> 1925.1999999999998
the thing is

1921.76 --> 1928.559
i could say that the funny thing is i

1925.2 --> 1932.159
actually in a way used to say that

1928.559 --> 1934.48
it's complicated but you're not gonna

1932.159 --> 1936.159
start out with that now because if

1934.48 --> 1938.32
you're gonna start out with that then it

1936.159 --> 1941.0390000000002
you got this

1938.32 --> 1943.84
this leftist type of connection and i

1941.039 --> 1943.84
don't want that

1944.24 --> 1952.24
i want to be a man and a woman but

1949.279 --> 1954.399
yeah i also just want i want a more

1952.24 --> 1956.08
complex relationship anyway and

1954.399 --> 1958.9599999999998
for that you need kind of recognition

1956.08 --> 1962.48
that people don't

1958.96 --> 1965.8400000000001
really a hundred percent fit

1962.48 --> 1966.799
like their act their social act towards

1965.84 --> 1969.36
others

1966.799 --> 1969.9189999999999
all that you know i need a girl that

1969.36 --> 1972.9599999999998
that can

1969.919 --> 1977.1200000000001
really do that step away from that and

1972.96 --> 1980.32
take it very serious

1977.12 --> 1982.1589999999999
it's hard to find these days

1980.32 --> 1984.48
plenty of girls that are just willing to

1982.159 --> 1986.88
fool around

1984.48 --> 1988.32
or not a lot that will actually get

1986.88 --> 1991.8400000000001
serious

1988.32 --> 1991.84
that's over here

1995.6 --> 1999.039
and then again maybe there are the girls

1997.519 --> 2001.519
out there too that

1999.039 --> 2002.84
would get serious but then they are they

2001.519 --> 2007.039
just get too

2002.84 --> 2009.519
nervous and in a way i have that too

2007.039 --> 2011.36
like for me stepping to a girl is a

2009.519 --> 2013.6
really big deal if i like them it's

2011.36 --> 2018.8799999999999
really big deal

2013.6 --> 2021.4399999999998
and that's problematic

2018.88 --> 2025.2
and it's very rare for me to like find a

2021.44 --> 2027.679
proper moment where that would actually

2025.2 --> 2029.039
supposed to be where that's supposed to

2027.679 --> 2031.76
happen

2029.039 --> 2033.6
when it really fits i have plenty of

2031.76 --> 2036.799
times where i tried something

2033.6 --> 2038.48
and it just was complete

2036.799 --> 2040.1589999999999
it turned out that i'm basically not

2038.48 --> 2042.3990000000001
informed enough

2040.159 --> 2046.96
about the person or i didn't understand

2042.399 --> 2049.52
them good enough from a distance

2046.96 --> 2050.56
size them up incorrectly thought they

2049.52 --> 2054.0
had traits

2050.56 --> 2054.0
which they turned out they didn't

2063.839 --> 2066.159
all right

2067.04 --> 2073.839
so i don't know for me man i think it's

2070.48 --> 2074.96
i'm gonna probably always be forced to

2073.839 --> 2077.52
just resort to

2074.96 --> 2080.2400000000002
group dynamics because in group dynamics

2077.52 --> 2083.599
if you're in a group

2080.24 --> 2086.1589999999997
then it's just so much easier to just

2083.599 --> 2088.0
first of all get used to the presence of

2086.159 --> 2090.8
a person that you might find

2088.0 --> 2091.599
attractive you know it's not just oh you

2090.8 --> 2093.119
have to have

2091.599 --> 2094.48
you have to take this one single

2093.119 --> 2095.44
opportunity that you're going to bump

2094.48 --> 2098.72
into them

2095.44 --> 2100.8
in this time of the day

2098.72 --> 2102.0
no you're just sitting there and you can

2100.8 --> 2105.3590000000004
size it up see them

2102.0 --> 2107.2
talk get used to it and then

2105.359 --> 2117.839
potentially decide what you're going to

2107.2 --> 2117.839
do that works much better for me

2120.079 --> 2126.2400000000002
or or at some point i could get just

2123.119 --> 2129.28
really manic and

2126.24 --> 2130.56
yeah go in mask mode that's part of the

2129.28 --> 2132.8
reason why

2130.56 --> 2133.7599999999998
that movie does appeal to that just that

2132.8 --> 2136.4
mania

2133.76 --> 2138.079
that's i've experienced that level of

2136.4 --> 2142.2400000000002
mania too where it would

2138.079 --> 2146.5600000000004
just be like that and it's not even

2142.24 --> 2148.7999999999997
drug fueled well maybe a bit of cannabis

2146.56 --> 2150.7999999999997
but not like really something that would

2148.8 --> 2154.7200000000003
induce that state other than just

2150.8 --> 2154.7200000000003
my own freaking hormones and all that

2157.04 --> 2164.72
and uh yeah when i mean like that

2160.8 --> 2167.04
then it's just very easy actually

2164.72 --> 2168.64
like you bump into a girl and it's just

2167.04 --> 2172.4
you don't even

2168.64 --> 2176.4
you just go immediately

2172.4 --> 2179.52
but if i'm not in a manic state then i

2176.4 --> 2181.28
never really do it like that because i

2179.52 --> 2183.52
yeah there is all kinds of things in

2181.28 --> 2188.079
between then that and i can't just

2183.52 --> 2189.92
go there anymore it's odd how that works

2188.079 --> 2192.2400000000002
i think to wait for a certain state of

2189.92 --> 2192.2400000000002
mind

2197.28 --> 2215.8390000000004
it's no guarantee either that you're

2198.96 --> 2215.839
going to end up with somebody either

2220.88 --> 2224.8
yeah i guess it's not coming out of

2224.4 --> 2230.48
there

2224.8 --> 2230.48
anytime soon talking about that

2236.56 --> 2240.56
right well obermuco i don't think

2238.8 --> 2242.2400000000002
anything is going to go back to normal

2240.56 --> 2244.64
after vaccination i think it's just

2242.24 --> 2246.3199999999997
gonna get worse

2244.64 --> 2248.4
i think the only way things are gonna go

2246.32 --> 2252.079
back to normal is if people

2248.4 --> 2253.92
just say okay fine

2252.079 --> 2256.48
we're not gonna be slaves so we're gonna

2253.92 --> 2259.359
have to be outlaws then

2256.48 --> 2260.72
and then we're gonna get together with

2259.359 --> 2263.7599999999998
people that are actually

2260.72 --> 2267.68
responsible minded that are willing to

2263.76 --> 2271.3590000000004
potentially risk their lives

2267.68 --> 2274.3999999999996
and risk end up basically

2271.359 --> 2277.92
ending up dishonored publicly

2274.4 --> 2281.52
shamed if it fails and just

2277.92 --> 2282.4
take it down take it down target the

2281.52 --> 2285.359
organization

2282.4 --> 2287.2000000000003
specifically that have propelled this

2285.359 --> 2289.2
the world health organizations and all

2287.2 --> 2291.9199999999996
branches in there

2289.2 --> 2294.24
and just get the whole entire

2291.92 --> 2295.76
infrastructure that caused this thing to

2294.24 --> 2299.4399999999996
arrive

2295.76 --> 2301.2000000000003
take it all out like for real

2299.44 --> 2303.44
like a coup but not against the

2301.2 --> 2304.56
government but against that specific

2303.44 --> 2307.359
branch

2304.56 --> 2308.16
against that organization that part and

2307.359 --> 2311.7599999999998
arrest all

2308.16 --> 2312.24
like the health minister oh my god that

2311.76 --> 2315.92
guy

2312.24 --> 2319.2799999999997
is has to be arrested for basically

2315.92 --> 2319.28
conspiring with all this

2319.52 --> 2328.56
just allowing damage

2323.359 --> 2328.56
societal social economic damage

2329.04 --> 2332.64
and that should happen everywhere it's

2330.64 --> 2335.68
going to be tougher in some

2332.64 --> 2335.68
countries as others

2337.2 --> 2342.72
but i think that's the only thing that's

2339.04 --> 2342.72
going to make it turn back to normal

2347.44 --> 2351.359
because all the yeah all the big

2349.28 --> 2353.44
organizations all the infrastructure and

2351.359 --> 2356.56
all that is all subjected to this

2353.44 --> 2357.76
and that's never gonna go away until the

2356.56 --> 2362.32
thing that is making

2357.76 --> 2368.2400000000002
all that do this until that is taken out

2362.32 --> 2371.6800000000003
and with taken out i mean arrested

2368.24 --> 2374.3999999999996
not by a slow trial pro just go in

2371.68 --> 2374.3999999999996
arrest them

2376.32 --> 2379.599
just take them out of their function

2378.0 --> 2382.72
arrest them

2379.599 --> 2384.0
lay down like yeah it's illegal to

2382.72 --> 2387.68
follow that policy

2384.0 --> 2391.2
at the time being it has to be disbanded

2387.68 --> 2392.16
immediately everywhere everybody has to

2391.2 --> 2397.04
throw their mask

2392.16 --> 2400.3199999999997
in the trash right now

2397.04 --> 2402.96
and then yeah then after that

2400.32 --> 2404.6400000000003
then the slow freaking process comes and

2402.96 --> 2406.7200000000003
it'll probably take another freaking

2404.64 --> 2408.8799999999997
20 years before it's all worked out

2406.72 --> 2410.48
exactly who and what it was responsible

2408.88 --> 2412.079
for what and what the penalty is going

2410.48 --> 2415.119
to be

2412.079 --> 2417.599
and it's guaranteed to have some life

2415.119 --> 2419.52
sentences in there

2417.599 --> 2425.52
depending on the country maybe even the

2419.52 --> 2427.7599999999998
death penalty

2425.52 --> 2430.48
it's not gonna be here though because

2427.76 --> 2433.8390000000004
they don't have that anymore here

2430.48 --> 2436.4
and that is probably the only thing

2433.839 --> 2439.359
that's gonna make it go away

2436.4 --> 2440.56
because taking a vaccine is not going to

2439.359 --> 2443.839
stop it

2440.56 --> 2446.72
anything they say is going to stop it

2443.839 --> 2447.52
will not stop it they're not going to

2446.72 --> 2450.9599999999996
stop

2447.52 --> 2452.64
because it's them doing it and the only

2450.96 --> 2456.0
thing they're basically doing is

2452.64 --> 2456.8799999999997
trying to make everybody dance through

2456.0 --> 2459.119
hoops

2456.88 --> 2461.52
on the short run with false promises and

2459.119 --> 2461.52
panic

2462.079 --> 2465.28
but they're not going to stop until they

2464.96 --> 2468.88
are

2465.28 --> 2468.88
made to stop

2469.359 --> 2473.359
everybody really has to understand this

2471.839 --> 2476.4
this is not a

2473.359 --> 2478.16
situation you can just write it out

2476.4 --> 2479.44
unless you're like really heavily

2478.16 --> 2481.2799999999997
homesteaded and

2479.44 --> 2483.68
pretty isolated and you got everything

2481.28 --> 2483.6800000000003
you need

2485.76 --> 2489.0400000000004
but even then you're still going to be

2487.76 --> 2492.1600000000003
confronted with it

2489.04 --> 2492.16
everywhere you go

2492.64 --> 2498.48
until it's taken out that's just the way

2496.24 --> 2502.64
it is

2498.48 --> 2504.56
that's that's the thing they've done

2502.64 --> 2506.0
they put it there and they're basically

2504.56 --> 2509.599
counting on it's too

2506.0 --> 2511.2
tough too tiresome and with everybody

2509.599 --> 2513.52
going along with it that makes it even

2511.2 --> 2514.96
more strenuous and tiresome to do

2513.52 --> 2515.7599999999998
something about it that's what they're

2514.96 --> 2517.76
counting on

2515.76 --> 2519.5200000000004
they're just open criminals counting on

2517.76 --> 2523.28
that nobody's gonna

2519.52 --> 2525.839
find the stamina and the collective

2523.28 --> 2527.2000000000003
will to stop it that's what they're

2525.839 --> 2530.0
counting on

2527.2 --> 2530.0
do you understand

2534.079 --> 2540.2400000000002
like the time to just learn about

2537.119 --> 2544.319
things and then stay passive or

2540.24 --> 2545.839
not get involved like don't participate

2544.319 --> 2550.079
in their tricks and their

2545.839 --> 2552.56
in their in their word games

2550.079 --> 2554.96
judicially smart about yeah that's that

2552.56 --> 2556.88
that's really good you know we've been

2554.96 --> 2558.319
working on that trying to clarify how

2556.88 --> 2560.48
that works in people

2558.319 --> 2561.52
with people what you could do we've been

2560.48 --> 2564.16
doing that for

2561.52 --> 2566.4
half a year and before that too with

2564.16 --> 2570.0
other things

2566.4 --> 2572.64
unfortunately it's not enough anymore

2570.0 --> 2573.44
because things are only going to get

2572.64 --> 2575.7599999999998
worse

2573.44 --> 2577.68
and eventually you won't have enough

2575.76 --> 2580.7200000000003
maneuvering room

2577.68 --> 2581.839
to reach them anymore

2580.72 --> 2584.0789999999997
because you're going to be too

2581.839 --> 2585.7599999999998
preoccupied too cut off too many

2584.079 --> 2587.52
checkpoints you can't get through

2585.76 --> 2593.3590000000004
anymore

2587.52 --> 2596.8
so yeah if there's not a worldwide

2593.359 --> 2597.68
anti-medical tyranny revolution about to

2596.8 --> 2602.1600000000003
happen

2597.68 --> 2602.16
pretty quickly as in

2602.48 --> 2607.839
at least at least before the end of the

2605.119 --> 2607.839
year then

2608.16 --> 2612.72
i'd say we're pretty much all doomed and

2610.8 --> 2615.2000000000003
it's really gonna end

2612.72 --> 2615.839
the world in the western world will turn

2615.2 --> 2619.04
into

2615.839 --> 2621.52
a police state militarized

2619.04 --> 2622.16
medical tyranny and there will be

2621.52 --> 2624.24
nothing

2622.16 --> 2626.0789999999997
we will ever be able to do to get out of

2624.24 --> 2629.9199999999996
it again ever

2626.079 --> 2629.92
it's all gonna die they will win

2630.8 --> 2634.4
if we don't physically remove the

2633.599 --> 2639.119
medical

2634.4 --> 2642.4
tyranny instigators then they win

2639.119 --> 2648.079
and then the west is completely lost

2642.4 --> 2650.8
completely irreversibly lost

2648.079 --> 2652.6400000000003
just saying no just knowing and not

2650.8 --> 2653.52
participating is not going to do it

2652.64 --> 2656.0
anymore

2653.52 --> 2656.88
they're just going to move the bar

2656.0 --> 2658.24
isolate you

2656.88 --> 2660.319
further they're just going to create

2658.24 --> 2663.839
checkpoints everywhere and you will

2660.319 --> 2665.119
not be able to get through

2663.839 --> 2667.2799999999997
you might be able to get through if

2665.119 --> 2669.04
you've got a freaking vaccine pass or

2667.28 --> 2670.6400000000003
whatever

2669.04 --> 2672.64
and then yeah you might be able to get

2670.64 --> 2674.48
through until you can't

2672.64 --> 2676.0789999999997
anymore and they cut that off too and

2674.48 --> 2679.44
you still got the freaking vaccine

2676.079 --> 2683.6800000000003
and you're gonna die in a few years so

2679.44 --> 2686.96
yeah there is nothing

2683.68 --> 2689.52
ever you can do to go along

2686.96 --> 2690.8
and get along and get through it to the

2689.52 --> 2693.92
end there is

2690.8 --> 2697.599
zero ways to do this

2693.92 --> 2699.119
the only way we can stop the medical

2697.599 --> 2702.4
tyranny

2699.119 --> 2705.28
is by going after the medical

2702.4 --> 2706.319
tyranny instigators that are

2705.28 --> 2710.079
specifically

2706.319 --> 2714.0
running this massive government

2710.079 --> 2717.44
and corporation driven ponzi scheme

2714.0 --> 2717.44
suspension of disbelief

2717.839 --> 2723.04
about something that doesn't exist and

2719.599 --> 2725.28
then offering solutions that don't help

2723.04 --> 2726.079
and they'll effectively distract people

2725.28 --> 2728.5600000000004
enough to

2726.079 --> 2729.599
just get them to just form their own

2728.56 --> 2731.92
pens

2729.599 --> 2734.0
then they yeah they build a fence around

2731.92 --> 2736.8
it metaphorically

2734.0 --> 2737.76
put the guards there and then it's over

2736.8 --> 2740.88
it's over

2737.76 --> 2743.44
after that you won't be able to

2740.88 --> 2744.839
allow you won't even be allowed to leave

2743.44 --> 2748.4
your freaking

2744.839 --> 2752.0
city soylent green

2748.4 --> 2754.2400000000002
level [ __ ] that is what it will turn to

2752.0 --> 2755.2
and it's not going to take 50 years now

2754.24 --> 2758.7999999999997
that that will take

2755.2 --> 2762.24
five years five years

2758.8 --> 2762.2400000000002
before that point is reached

2767.04 --> 2772.88
it's i don't know man maybe maybe it'll

2770.16 --> 2774.16
happen in a singular year maybe once

2772.88 --> 2777.119
they really discover

2774.16 --> 2778.319
yeah nobody is going to do anything

2777.119 --> 2782.2400000000002
about it even like

2778.319 --> 2784.96
if the people that are instigating it

2782.24 --> 2785.2799999999997
will literally publicly tell the people

2784.96 --> 2789.76
like

2785.28 --> 2793.6800000000003
if you don't stop me right now

2789.76 --> 2795.3590000000004
i'm going to do this and if people don't

2793.68 --> 2799.2
stop them

2795.359 --> 2799.2
they're going to do it and then it's

2800.839 --> 2803.839
over

2807.76 --> 2817.8390000000004
anybody getting this anybody listening

2811.599 --> 2817.839
it's kind of urgent

2828.839 --> 2831.839
so

2839.28 --> 2845.8390000000004
there's no dolphins here that's

2840.88 --> 2845.839
ridiculous it's just magpies

2856.839 --> 2859.839
see

2862.38 --> 2865.4990000000003
[Music]

2870.839 --> 2875.7599999999998
hmm

2873.52 --> 2875.7599999999998
now

2879.28 --> 2882.6400000000003
their lives are uncovered

2885.04 --> 2888.319
all the fraud has already been uncovered

2887.44 --> 2891.52
they just

2888.319 --> 2895.839
need to be taken out of their

2891.52 --> 2898.559
place like yeah you are going to stop

2895.839 --> 2901.7599999999998
doing this now we are going to arrest

2898.559 --> 2905.44
you now

2901.76 --> 2909.0400000000004
and yeah that's really nice you have

2905.44 --> 2912.64
for 10 like 10 million

2909.04 --> 2912.96
dollars worth of lawyers to try and keep

2912.64 --> 2915.68
you

2912.96 --> 2919.119
out yeah we're just going to escort you

2915.68 --> 2919.1189999999997
to a secret place then

2920.8 --> 2924.96
because you're going to stop it now you

2922.559 --> 2927.2000000000003
are not going to continue the function

2924.96 --> 2928.079
of what you're doing you're not gonna

2927.2 --> 2930.7999999999997
have access

2928.079 --> 2931.76
to phones and internet to communicate

2930.8 --> 2934.2400000000002
with others

2931.76 --> 2935.76
to continue the plan anymore it's going

2934.24 --> 2939.5989999999997
to end

2935.76 --> 2942.6400000000003
that's that's how you do it

2939.599 --> 2945.76
doesn't matter how much freaking money

2942.64 --> 2948.8799999999997
and connections they have just

2945.76 --> 2950.1600000000003
have to be escorted out of their

2948.88 --> 2953.2000000000003
function

2950.16 --> 2954.0789999999997
and if necessary to a secret place like

2953.2 --> 2957.2799999999997
who gives a

2954.079 --> 2959.44
fleeting [ __ ] if that's illegal or

2957.28 --> 2960.3190000000004
if the entire [ __ ] media everywhere

2959.44 --> 2963.92
stood yeah

2960.319 --> 2966.48
oh no the nuts taken over yeah get those

2963.92 --> 2967.28
[ __ ] media pieces of [ __ ] out of

2966.48 --> 2971.599
there as well just

2967.28 --> 2974.96
drag them out of the studios life live

2971.599 --> 2976.0
get people in there i don't care how

2974.96 --> 2976.559
they're going to look that if they're

2976.0 --> 2979.92
going to wear

2976.559 --> 2980.4
uniforms or masks or whatever the [ __ ]

2979.92 --> 2982.88
and just

2980.4 --> 2985.04
drag these people by their coats out

2982.88 --> 2985.76
during the live transmission just drag

2985.04 --> 2989.04
them out

2985.76 --> 2989.0400000000004
like it's done here

2991.2 --> 2998.319
this operation is ending right now

2995.839 --> 3000.7999999999997
you're not going to continue doing this

2998.319 --> 3000.8
anymore

3004.88 --> 3013.839
because yeah everyone is

3008.16 --> 3013.839
sick of it

3061.599 --> 3069.839
all right hello chris math

3070.079 --> 3076.96
right and i don't know man

3073.28 --> 3078.88
by now there should be plenty of people

3076.96 --> 3081.28
that would be volunteering to do this

3078.88 --> 3085.52
people that have already

3081.28 --> 3085.52
basically lost their jobs and [ __ ]

3087.52 --> 3091.68
that had their dreams yeah that they

3090.4 --> 3093.92
thought they could all do

3091.68 --> 3095.44
probably plenty that have had their

3093.92 --> 3098.0
dreams destroyed

3095.44 --> 3100.16
now if only those people would not be

3098.0 --> 3102.48
stupid enough to just give up on their

3100.16 --> 3103.04
own lives and commit suicide but just

3102.48 --> 3106.079
realize

3103.04 --> 3108.079
like yeah this is actually an

3106.079 --> 3109.52
opportunity because i'm not bound by

3108.079 --> 3112.079
some dream anymore

3109.52 --> 3113.52
i got freedom to do whatever is

3112.079 --> 3117.599
necessary and it won't be

3113.52 --> 3121.7599999999998
much of a loss then if it goes wrong

3117.599 --> 3121.76
if all these people just get together

3122.24 --> 3129.1189999999997
realize what's going on

3125.28 --> 3129.119
and then make a move

3129.28 --> 3135.6800000000003
the people's front like the real

3132.4 --> 3138.48
people's front not some stupid marxist

3135.68 --> 3140.16
disgusting satanist revolution piece of

3138.48 --> 3143.359
[ __ ] financed by a bunch of

3140.16 --> 3148.0
fascist [ __ ] bankers but just real

3143.359 --> 3150.48
people disenfranchised people local

3148.0 --> 3151.28
that are going to buy bind together like

3150.48 --> 3154.559
a militia

3151.28 --> 3157.76
and just a militia

3154.559 --> 3159.44
as roughly as an idea like here we don't

3157.76 --> 3164.1600000000003
have weapons really

3159.44 --> 3168.8
and just stop it stop it from continuing

3164.16 --> 3173.1189999999997
go to the source and arrest those people

3168.8 --> 3175.3590000000004
take them to a secret place if necessary

3173.119 --> 3176.48
for not saying that you should disappear

3175.359 --> 3180.4
them

3176.48 --> 3183.04
but just yeah so it can't just be

3180.4 --> 3183.92
folded quickly and yeah take their

3183.04 --> 3187.52
secret place

3183.92 --> 3191.839
then yeah

3187.52 --> 3194.16
it's out of the way and then

3191.839 --> 3195.2799999999997
later after the situation has been

3194.16 --> 3200.319
resolved

3195.28 --> 3202.1600000000003
the person can yeah be revealed again

3200.319 --> 3203.7599999999998
and that's it yeah this sounds kind of

3202.16 --> 3205.5989999999997
like

3203.76 --> 3207.8390000000004
like kidnapping and all that but it's

3205.599 --> 3211.44
not it's a

3207.839 --> 3214.24
but it's arresting in a way

3211.44 --> 3217.119
that prevents them from illegally

3214.24 --> 3219.04
applying their mercenary system to just

3217.119 --> 3222.319
grab them back quickly

3219.04 --> 3226.4
which they do have

3222.319 --> 3229.44
don't underestimate how much

3226.4 --> 3232.48
governmental level functions mega

3229.44 --> 3235.44
corporations even have available to them

3232.48 --> 3236.079
they're a giant worldwide guild the

3235.44 --> 3240.96
biggest

3236.079 --> 3244.0
guild of power and

3240.96 --> 3245.359
possibilities what they can do is the

3244.0 --> 3247.28
world has ever seen

3245.359 --> 3249.52
so they got all the lawyers they got

3247.28 --> 3251.3590000000004
their own freaking military force if

3249.52 --> 3253.52
need be they got mercenaries they got

3251.359 --> 3257.5989999999997
police

3253.52 --> 3260.0
people they got all kinds of things they

3257.599 --> 3260.0
can do

3261.52 --> 3267.28
that's why just arresting some of these

3265.2 --> 3268.0
people in high functions as if they were

3267.28 --> 3272.6400000000003
a common

3268.0 --> 3272.64
criminal unconnected it's not gonna work

3272.96 --> 3279.92
because they will just unleash

3276.48 --> 3283.599
their lawyers onto it and the corrupted

3279.92 --> 3287.2000000000003
police and then it's yeah over quickly

3283.599 --> 3288.319
i think i don't know i'm spitballing at

3287.2 --> 3290.799
this point i'm just

3288.319 --> 3292.96
really eager to get it done i want these

3290.799 --> 3296.079
people out of the way

3292.96 --> 3297.68
so sick of this i've been sick of this

3296.079 --> 3299.28
for 20 years

3297.68 --> 3300.799
never really knew what i could do about

3299.28 --> 3303.52
it because people

3300.799 --> 3305.28
wouldn't even listen to the most basic

3303.52 --> 3308.799
things back then

3305.28 --> 3311.92
no and all the [ __ ] was actually

3308.799 --> 3314.24
getting finalized during the obama years

3311.92 --> 3315.119
much of the [ __ ] that's going down now

3314.24 --> 3319.359
was basically

3315.119 --> 3321.28
finalized during that eight year period

3319.359 --> 3324.0789999999997
that's when they really put the final

3321.28 --> 3326.6400000000003
pieces into place

3324.079 --> 3327.76
because everybody just let it happen

3326.64 --> 3335.839
everybody

3327.76 --> 3335.8390000000004
just let it happen

3343.599 --> 3350.079
all right oh it's already three o'clock

3347.52 --> 3351.04
right so anyway yeah the whole corona

3350.079 --> 3354.4
lockdown

3351.04 --> 3356.799
[ __ ] it has to be stopped

3354.4 --> 3358.799
but but the only way that i could figure

3356.799 --> 3360.4
out to stop it is by taking out the

3358.799 --> 3364.4
entire apparatus

3360.4 --> 3364.4
that has been organizing this

3364.799 --> 3369.2
and that would be well partially the un

3367.92 --> 3371.2000000000003
it would be the world health

3369.2 --> 3374.319
organization it would be

3371.2 --> 3374.72
the people in the governments that are

3374.319 --> 3376.48
part

3374.72 --> 3378.16
that are literally being part of the

3376.48 --> 3381.44
agenda it would be

3378.16 --> 3383.92
even the corporations like i think that

3381.44 --> 3385.68
all corporations that are getting

3383.92 --> 3388.079
involved with this [ __ ] and the

3385.68 --> 3392.64
programming they should all get

3388.079 --> 3395.52
massive fines massive fines

3392.64 --> 3396.96
because they're doing it for [ __ ]
