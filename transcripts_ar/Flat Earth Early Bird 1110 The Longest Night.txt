right

132.959 --> 137.04
but yeah i got the time mixed up a

134.959 --> 140.56
little because in my head when i woke up

137.04 --> 140.56
today i thought it was saturday

140.84 --> 145.52
weird and then

143.44 --> 148.4
when i was doing groceries i realized

145.52 --> 151.519
wait it's friday because saturday the

148.4 --> 152.48000000000002
stores are closed hold on

uh

152.48 --> 157.84
yeah

153.76 --> 157.84
so today is going to be a short show day

158.8 --> 164.4
hello bill nye the science denier first

161.04 --> 164.4
in chat mike sidoonich

165.04 --> 168.79999999999998
right

166.319 --> 168.79999999999998
got about

169.12 --> 171.84
40 minutes

172.64 --> 176.23899999999998
so i'm gonna make the best of that

179.599 --> 185.159
well for starters

181.36 --> 185.15900000000002
good news everyone

189.36 --> 193.92000000000002
here's a link

190.959 --> 196.31900000000002
hello wesley sure

193.92 --> 197.44
yeah nathan oakley's daughter clover is

196.319 --> 199.11999999999998
doing

197.44 --> 201.519
perfectly fine

199.12 --> 204.72
as you can see in this video

201.519 --> 206.08
nathan posted a message

204.72 --> 208.72
with clover

206.08 --> 211.68
and yeah she's doing fine still

208.72 --> 215.68
probably a little shaken from the whole

211.68 --> 215.68
experience but she seems fine

217.36 --> 221.519
so yeah that was a great relief of

219.68 --> 223.44
course

221.519 --> 226.959
don't know if nathan's gonna do a live

223.44 --> 229.12
show i think he probably is

226.959 --> 232.08
and yeah if he isn't then i'm gonna do a

229.12 --> 235.59900000000002
longer show than 40 minutes but i uh not

232.08 --> 235.59900000000002
expecting him not to do a show

236.159 --> 241.239
uh

237.439 --> 241.239
hello matthew hall

242.56 --> 245.599
right

243.519 --> 247.84
so yeah yesterday it's a pretty good

245.599 --> 247.84
show

247.92 --> 252.72
didn't watch it back though yet

250.72 --> 256.72
i might

252.72 --> 258.959
still do that that's a very long show

256.72 --> 258.959
uh

259.759 --> 265.6
but yeah gadget inspector

263.04 --> 266.639
he kind of went over the top

265.6 --> 269.44
it

266.639 --> 270.96000000000004
and it's comparable to the agm effect no

269.44 --> 273.44
offense agm

270.96 --> 275.35999999999996
seems like you're not having issues like

273.44 --> 277.6
that anymore

275.36 --> 280.32
but yeah gadget inspector is and

277.6 --> 281.36
yesterday in the letter debate chat and

280.32 --> 283.52
all that

281.36 --> 286.47900000000004
he just went completely

283.52 --> 288.479
gamma spazz out on me like really damn

286.479 --> 290.4
as fast out

288.479 --> 293.28
where he was like constantly trying to

290.4 --> 293.28
slander me and

296.32 --> 301.28
like i didn't like start stabbing him

298.56 --> 301.28000000000003
back of course

301.52 --> 305.59999999999997
but yeah i did call him out for what he

303.36 --> 307.91900000000004
was doing and just telling him like yeah

305.6 --> 308.88
this is not working this is

307.919 --> 311.12
he he

308.88 --> 314.32
tried to strawman me

311.12 --> 316.32
that i banned him because he

314.32 --> 318.08
mentioned

316.32 --> 319.84
the sun position

318.08 --> 322.0
on the ae map

319.84 --> 324.15999999999997
it's like no no it's not and he kept

322.0 --> 326.479
repeating it so he was like stuck in a

324.16 --> 329.6
big gamma cycle not good not good for

326.479 --> 332.0
him right it's not i don't care

329.6 --> 334.8
it's just a straw man

332.0 --> 337.039
but yeah i hope he will do

334.8 --> 339.039
okay i think he's just really stressed

337.039 --> 340.96
out or something christmas time stressed

339.039 --> 344.15999999999997
out i think

340.96 --> 345.84
but yeah he's not gonna come back to my

344.16 --> 348.24
chat for a while

345.84 --> 351.67999999999995
but yeah

348.24 --> 354.56
i hope he snaps out of it

351.68 --> 356.639
and then if he proves that to me outside

354.56 --> 359.759
of the show then i will let him back

356.639 --> 359.759
like with agm

360.8 --> 367.28000000000003
who's by the way been through that

362.96 --> 369.75899999999996
several times although i have to say agm

367.28 --> 372.23999999999995
never really gamma s passed out on me

369.759 --> 372.24
like that

374.639 --> 378.319
agm would just go berserk

378.4 --> 381.84
and paranoia and all that and yeah

380.479 --> 384.15999999999997
that's different

381.84 --> 385.84
that's like really more obviously a

384.16 --> 388.47900000000004
personal problem

385.84 --> 390.63899999999995
right and agm knows that about himself

388.479 --> 391.52
and he's like really worked on it i

390.639 --> 394.0
think

391.52 --> 396.56
to get a grip on that and it's really

394.0 --> 398.88
admirable agm that you've done that

396.56 --> 402.88
and that you've been doing

398.88 --> 402.88
pretty good compared to earlier

403.039 --> 407.199
yeah the earlier period

404.96 --> 409.12
that that you came in like

407.199 --> 411.36
which is now two years i think maybe

409.12 --> 411.36
more

412.0 --> 415.599
but yeah

413.12 --> 417.84000000000003
gadget inspector i don't know

415.599 --> 420.4
if he's gonna stay like a gamma or if

417.84 --> 422.63899999999995
he's also yeah gonna snap out you never

420.4 --> 424.56
really know

422.639 --> 425.84000000000003
but for now he's not coming back to my

424.56 --> 428.08
chat

425.84 --> 430.88
and i just hope he

428.08 --> 433.19899999999996
snaps out of it anyway

430.88 --> 434.84
it is what it is

433.199 --> 437.68
oh a whole bunch of

434.84 --> 439.919
people look clutch merry christmas to

437.68 --> 443.039
you too

439.919 --> 443.039
balls is back

444.4 --> 450.63899999999995
right also remember that that character

448.08 --> 453.039
in the chat yesterday that i said hey

450.639 --> 453.84000000000003
are you the magnet guy

453.039 --> 454.96
yeah

453.84 --> 458.96
guess what

454.96 --> 462.15999999999997
it was him it was him he sent me this

458.96 --> 465.44
giant message through the email

462.16 --> 466.24
later that day it was him

465.44 --> 468.879
it's

466.24 --> 470.879
i can literally just tell by how he's

468.879 --> 472.72
talking what he's doing that it's him

470.879 --> 475.36
even if he doesn't identify himself he

472.72 --> 478.44000000000005
just can't help himself

475.36 --> 478.44
it's hilarious

478.639 --> 480.879
uh

482.8 --> 488.879
yeah mark's my lair it was him

485.68 --> 492.28000000000003
i i forgot his name but at the time but

488.879 --> 492.28000000000003
it was him

496.72 --> 499.52000000000004
what the hell

502.0 --> 506.639
okay balls so you're claiming that

504.319 --> 509.199
because you got a

506.639 --> 509.199
booster

509.52 --> 514.4789999999999
now you have a great 5g network

514.56 --> 522.56
you even realize how insane that sounds

518.56 --> 522.56
from multiple angles

522.64 --> 528.24
he's joking okay

525.44 --> 528.24
i hope so

532.24 --> 535.64
hello jose

537.6 --> 541.44
the boom force that's not really

539.36 --> 543.519
christmas that's more like a new year's

541.44 --> 547.36
eve force i think

543.519 --> 549.839
you know when actual fireworks go boom

547.36 --> 549.839
anyway

555.279 --> 559.24
hello seeking star wars

566.64 --> 569.92
right also yeah

571.04 --> 574.56
man

572.959 --> 576.959
i took

574.56 --> 579.5999999999999
another coffee this morning

576.959 --> 581.279
as a test

579.6 --> 583.36
and i'm like

581.279 --> 586.959
even now like i'm doing pretty good but

583.36 --> 589.279
i feel it like i totally called it

586.959 --> 592.0799999999999
i do it sometimes

589.279 --> 593.519
you know i have to keep testing even if

592.08 --> 595.36
it might the result might be

593.519 --> 598.0
inconvenient

595.36 --> 601.04
but yeah i feel

598.0 --> 602.399
okay but again the pressure from down

601.04 --> 605.519
there

602.399 --> 607.839
slightly now not too much to handle it

605.519 --> 609.76
is the coffee i now absolutely know for

607.839 --> 613.519
sure so yeah

609.76 --> 613.519
no more coffee in the morning for me

614.959 --> 619.8389999999999
i think it's overall better not to do

616.72 --> 619.839
that i don't need it

622.399 --> 627.68
and it's kind of weird as i was drinking

624.959 --> 631.04
it didn't even seem all that enjoyable

627.68 --> 635.279
it's i don't know what it is

631.04 --> 636.64
so yeah did another coffee test

635.279 --> 638.32
and

636.64 --> 641.279
yeah

638.32 --> 643.6800000000001
now i know for sure like every time i

641.279 --> 645.92
take a coffee now in the morning

643.68 --> 649.519
in the coming period it's completely on

645.92 --> 649.519
me i know now what it does

651.12 --> 655.519
i love coffee but caffeine isn't great

653.2 --> 658.0
for me personally right

655.519 --> 659.36
i don't know if it's the caffeine

658.0 --> 662.24
probably

659.36 --> 665.12
and a bit of sugar

662.24 --> 668.5600000000001
and you know it's worked great for me

665.12 --> 670.8
for years and almost a decade

668.56 --> 672.3199999999999
but

670.8 --> 675.1999999999999
right now it

672.32 --> 677.519
it i'm not responding well to it maybe

675.2 --> 682.0790000000001
it's just the times and the amount of

677.519 --> 682.079
stress that's kind of going around

685.12 --> 688.12
right

689.839 --> 697.2
alcohol

691.92 --> 697.1999999999999
is a babylon drug of control okay

698.959 --> 706.1999999999999
depends on how you're using it but a

702.079 --> 706.1999999999999
little fuzzy brush monk

718.56 --> 723.3599999999999
respond worse to caffeine in coffee than

721.92 --> 725.92
tea

723.36 --> 727.519
right well coffee is kind of known to

725.92 --> 729.68
have several

727.519 --> 730.399
kind of unique effects

729.68 --> 733.5999999999999
where

730.399 --> 736.56
it apparently makes your liver

733.6 --> 739.6800000000001
eject into your system

736.56 --> 742.16
like stored vitamins

739.68 --> 744.4799999999999
but that also means that

742.16 --> 746.959
it kind of then deprives it from your

744.48 --> 746.9590000000001
system

749.6 --> 754.0790000000001
so yeah it's kind of a mix

751.839 --> 754.0790000000001
yeah

754.32 --> 758.6800000000001
it's a kickstarter effect

759.36 --> 764.8000000000001
but like a whole bunch of things just

761.519 --> 764.8
happens to your system

767.519 --> 773.36
and right now i'm just not handling it

770.56 --> 775.76
well

773.36 --> 775.76
anyway

780.48 --> 786.519
double latte every day

783.519 --> 786.519
huh

786.8 --> 791.88
hello elise g

788.399 --> 791.88
good to see you

821.199 --> 826.3199999999999
right

822.8 --> 829.279
yeah nathan yesterday played the jose

826.32 --> 831.6
episode of the fed again

829.279 --> 833.519
and damn that show is

831.6 --> 835.6
great

833.519 --> 836.48
it's like the third time i've watched it

835.6 --> 841.16
now

836.48 --> 841.16
and it's like a really interesting

842.56 --> 848.56
very easy to assimilate episode with

846.48 --> 850.88
different things happening jose getting

848.56 --> 852.8
on there and getting stuck in the

850.88 --> 854.72
dichotomy between

852.8 --> 857.4399999999999
black swan

854.72 --> 860.399
and terrestrial refraction

857.44 --> 861.2790000000001
and then me later kind of talking about

860.399 --> 863.44
the

861.279 --> 866.16
architecture of

863.44 --> 868.5600000000001
yeah space narrative things

866.16 --> 870.639
and how space station would be designed

868.56 --> 873.1199999999999
more like a tanker

870.639 --> 875.04
in comparison to a plane everybody first

873.12 --> 876.48
kind of especially brian like rejecting

875.04 --> 878.639
it no no no

876.48 --> 881.279
and then eventually

878.639 --> 883.199
me just being kind of like yeah it is no

881.279 --> 884.399
i am right and i'm not claiming it's

883.199 --> 886.88
real

884.399 --> 888.0
and then eventually people getting it

886.88 --> 889.76
and

888.0 --> 892.639
yeah

889.76 --> 894.8
i get compliments from the ballers too

892.639 --> 897.839
because they know what's right like what

894.8 --> 900.24
i'm saying is right that's real that's

897.839 --> 901.839
real for them

900.24 --> 905.04
that's

901.839 --> 907.12
the official canon

905.04 --> 909.36
right and now the

907.12 --> 912.24
actor

909.36 --> 918.0790000000001
the actors out there the nasa what they

912.24 --> 921.04
do doesn't always comport to that logic

918.079 --> 923.04
right if they get sloppy and whether

921.04 --> 925.5999999999999
they do that on purpose or whether they

923.04 --> 928.639
are just not

925.6 --> 928.639
interested enough

929.04 --> 934.639
the remains to be seen

931.839 --> 935.839
but i i basically have a good overview

934.639 --> 937.6
on how

935.839 --> 941.839
you're supposed to do that so yeah i

937.6 --> 941.839
really like that show with jose on it

942.48 --> 944.72
and

945.92 --> 952.8389999999999
with that discussion

948.399 --> 952.839
this is just a really good show

957.6 --> 963.0400000000001
also yeah i really like it or i find it

963.199 --> 966.88
very convenient

965.199 --> 969.519
when i do something like that and

966.88 --> 972.32
everybody's like automatically oh no no

969.519 --> 975.2
are we no you're wrong

972.32 --> 980.0790000000001
and then it like no no i'm right

975.2 --> 983.839
[Laughter]

980.079 --> 983.8389999999999
i love it when it happens

986.639 --> 990.48
right so yeah nathan as far as i'm

988.639 --> 992.9590000000001
concerned it's like the episode of the

990.48 --> 996.0
year and you can replay it another 100

992.959 --> 999.04
times over the next 10 years

996.0 --> 999.92
because it was a great show

999.04 --> 1002.079
uh

999.92 --> 1005.36
right so let's see what do you guys talk

1002.079 --> 1005.3599999999999
what are you guys talking about

1009.6 --> 1013.839
hey robin stanley

1012.32 --> 1015.1990000000001
whoa

1013.839 --> 1018.8800000000001
oh man

1015.199 --> 1018.88
i've been hurt from you in ages

1018.959 --> 1022.7589999999999
how are you doing girl

1029.36 --> 1033.6789999999999
i hope you're well

1032.079 --> 1037.48
you were kind of in a bit of a

1033.679 --> 1037.48
complicated situation

1038.16 --> 1041.679
last time i've heard from you

1045.28 --> 1050.799
how did it all work out

1047.679 --> 1050.799
if you want to talk about it

1051.2 --> 1055.1200000000001
good okay that's great

1054.0 --> 1057.36
snow

1055.12 --> 1059.6789999999999
up there skiing

1057.36 --> 1059.6789999999999
cool

1060.0 --> 1065.84
yeah it's all rain over here now

1063.6 --> 1067.52
which is like weird because i think

1065.84 --> 1069.6
everybody

1067.52 --> 1071.9189999999999
was expecting like it's probably gonna

1069.6 --> 1074.3999999999999
snow on christmas or something because

1071.919 --> 1076.88
yesterday it was nothing like this and

1074.4 --> 1078.72
it was like really cold

1076.88 --> 1081.8400000000001
with ice

1078.72 --> 1081.84
hanging around

1081.919 --> 1086.5590000000002
pretty much all day but yeah that that

1084.0 --> 1087.84
completely turned around

1086.559 --> 1089.6
it's probably going to be a bit of a

1087.84 --> 1092.32
dreary christmas

1089.6 --> 1095.32
or maybe it'll just turn around again

1092.32 --> 1095.32
180

1095.52 --> 1101.0
by the time same time tomorrow i don't

1098.0 --> 1101.0
know

1110.48 --> 1114.559
oh

1111.36 --> 1115.9189999999999
i saw something really

1114.559 --> 1119.28
annoying

1115.919 --> 1119.2800000000002
right before i started the show

1119.36 --> 1122.8799999999999
didn't realize that's even going on with

1121.2 --> 1124.799
just people

1122.88 --> 1126.48
a family walking

1124.799 --> 1128.16
by

1126.48 --> 1129.76
out there

1128.16 --> 1132.4
like

1129.76 --> 1134.64
a dad a mom and two kids

1132.4 --> 1138.16
they were all wearing masks including

1134.64 --> 1140.72
the little kids like walking

1138.16 --> 1142.72
on the sidewalk i don't get it i don't

1140.72 --> 1144.16
get it

1142.72 --> 1145.44
why

1144.16 --> 1146.4
why are you doing that to your little

1145.44 --> 1149.799
kids

1146.4 --> 1149.799
what's the point

1151.36 --> 1155.6
ugh

1153.039 --> 1156.48
so yeah that i guess happens out there

1155.6 --> 1159.1999999999998
too

1156.48 --> 1161.1200000000001
it's not like everybody

1159.2 --> 1163.44
but there's just some

1161.12 --> 1166.1599999999999
families i guess out there that are just

1163.44 --> 1168.64
so immersed in this medical tyranny

1166.16 --> 1168.64
nonsense

1169.2 --> 1173.3600000000001
that they just wear masks for no reason

1173.84 --> 1179.1999999999998
including little kids and that's bad

1177.28 --> 1183.0
it's bad that they don't even realize

1179.2 --> 1183.0
how bad that is

1194.4 --> 1198.1200000000001
what's going on here

1212.96 --> 1219.08
oh

1213.919 --> 1219.0800000000002
oh we're talking v's oh how gross

1228.96 --> 1232.559
are you having like a back and forth

1230.48 --> 1234.08
with clutch like i don't even see his

1232.559 --> 1237.9189999999999
comments

1234.08 --> 1237.9189999999999
i'll get it what's going on here

1243.2 --> 1249.799
your position worked out well it did

1245.6 --> 1249.799
awesome robin stanley

1250.48 --> 1255.039
because

1252.48 --> 1256.64
like the whole museum project and all

1255.039 --> 1259.84
that was quite

1256.64 --> 1259.8400000000001
getting quite messy

1259.919 --> 1263.8400000000001
so i'm really glad that worked out

1269.679 --> 1273.8400000000001
can you make an intro song and video for

1272.4 --> 1277.76
my show wow

1273.84 --> 1279.28
well that flat fellow i feel honored

1277.76 --> 1282.64
but

1279.28 --> 1284.799
i am kind of like really happy with my

1282.64 --> 1286.64
intro

1284.799 --> 1288.96
and if i'd say

1286.64 --> 1291.44
yeah okay give it a go then i'd feel

1288.96 --> 1293.8400000000001
really guilty

1291.44 --> 1296.3200000000002
to not use it

1293.84 --> 1299.12
and i'm like kind of attached to my

1296.32 --> 1299.12
current intro

1299.919 --> 1304.4
unless you're like just want to do it

1302.159 --> 1306.5590000000002
anyway and don't mind if i wouldn't use

1304.4 --> 1306.5590000000002
it

1313.679 --> 1316.0800000000002
sorry

1317.52 --> 1323.28
i could play it sometimes well i don't

1320.159 --> 1323.2800000000002
know man it's

1325.52 --> 1328.9189999999999
i don't know

1332.0 --> 1336.08
being a dick to everybody by the time

1333.6 --> 1336.08
too much

1336.88 --> 1339.5200000000002
said to right dude was he talking to

1338.48 --> 1342.52
robin

1339.52 --> 1342.52
okay

1346.96 --> 1352.08
all right that flat fella i'm honored

1348.96 --> 1352.08
thank you very much man

1354.48 --> 1361.0
i'm kind of curious

1357.2 --> 1361.0
what you had in mind

1376.0 --> 1379.6
right

1377.2 --> 1380.88
by the way i did

1379.6 --> 1384.08
kind of like

1380.88 --> 1385.919
i was i don't know if you're

1384.08 --> 1386.799
you were thinking in that direction at

1385.919 --> 1389.3600000000001
all

1386.799 --> 1391.76
but i was kind of like

1389.36 --> 1395.52
thinking about getting a

1391.76 --> 1395.52
a night owl intro song

1400.32 --> 1405.6789999999999
which i by the way do not really have an

1402.96 --> 1405.679
idea for

1405.84 --> 1411.28
but yeah it makes no sense to make to

1408.24 --> 1412.799
use the early bird intro for the night

1411.28 --> 1416.48
owl show

1412.799 --> 1419.6
so maybe that can spark an idea among

1416.48 --> 1421.84
those that would like to get creative

1419.6 --> 1424.0
but

1421.84 --> 1428.039
yeah whatever you like

1424.0 --> 1428.039
i'm all good for now

1430.0 --> 1433.0
what

1450.4 --> 1458.679
oh god all right i see now yeah

1454.559 --> 1458.6789999999999
that balls is kind of gross

1460.24 --> 1463.1200000000001
now you're talking

1465.36 --> 1470.08
hey that flat fellow yeah thanks for

1467.279 --> 1472.88
your 99 cent super chatter nation

1470.08 --> 1474.96
bb's intro is epic

1472.88 --> 1477.7600000000002
did you see his take on the polo express

1474.96 --> 1481.039
oh yeah yeah i did

1477.76 --> 1484.48
i even discussed it a bit yesterday

1481.039 --> 1487.12
yeah that movie is messed up

1484.48 --> 1489.679
like really freaking creepy at certain

1487.12 --> 1492.8799999999999
points like

1489.679 --> 1494.799
serious almost like dark world type

1492.88 --> 1497.41
nightmare things

1494.799 --> 1498.559
really scary

1497.41 --> 1500.64
[Music]

1498.559 --> 1503.279
definitely not something you should show

1500.64 --> 1503.279
to a kid

1507.679 --> 1509.919
uh

1511.36 --> 1516.3999999999999
where do people even watch owen nowadays

1514.159 --> 1521.44
over at bitchute

1516.4 --> 1521.44
kenny blue bear cana bear

1523.919 --> 1528.5590000000002
i'll link you up

1525.76 --> 1531.6
to owen benjamin's

1528.559 --> 1531.6
[ __ ] you page

1534.559 --> 1539.279
or telegram right well yeah yeah that's

1537.44 --> 1541.52
more if you want to get

1539.279 --> 1543.84
to the live stuff and in live chat and

1541.52 --> 1543.84
all that

1546.0 --> 1550.279
and bipolar express

1568.159 --> 1572.159
offering prayer is not helpful

1570.4 --> 1575.919
really

1572.159 --> 1575.919
how the hell do you know that balls

1582.64 --> 1586.88
how do you know offering prayer is not

1584.559 --> 1590.1589999999999
helpful good intention

1586.88 --> 1593.0390000000002
is helpful it it works

1590.159 --> 1593.0390000000002
it really does

1593.84 --> 1599.12
there's been like studies to that stuff

1596.159 --> 1602.0
it it actually does work

1599.12 --> 1604.32
just as much as

1602.0 --> 1605.919
like with random

1604.32 --> 1610.0
yes or no

1605.919 --> 1612.64
like a bit outcome random generator

1610.0 --> 1615.36
the intention of the person their focus

1612.64 --> 1616.72
also helps yeah in this i feel in the

1615.36 --> 1618.9599999999998
similar way

1616.72 --> 1621.919
prayer helps as well because of the

1618.96 --> 1621.919
conscious attention

1623.919 --> 1627.4
it does work

1627.52 --> 1629.9189999999999
right

1628.32 --> 1631.76
i mean you can't

1629.919 --> 1634.5590000000002
change everything with it you can't

1631.76 --> 1636.96
actually change what's going on with it

1634.559 --> 1638.6399999999999
but you can

1636.96 --> 1641.679
kind of steer

1638.64 --> 1644.3990000000001
the outcome it it might

1641.679 --> 1646.24
yeah where it might end up

1644.399 --> 1648.7199999999998
depending on what's really going on

1646.24 --> 1650.799
which you do not have to fully be in the

1648.72 --> 1655.32
know of

1650.799 --> 1655.32
that part you leave to god

1659.2 --> 1664.48
oh there's no yeah well there's no god

1661.12 --> 1664.4799999999998
to you then balls

1667.039 --> 1670.32
hey yeah

1668.799 --> 1672.559
you don't have a god

1670.32 --> 1674.0
then you don't pray to god and then yeah

1672.559 --> 1675.2
it won't work

1674.0 --> 1679.0
yeah

1675.2 --> 1679.0
no surprise there

1689.45 --> 1695.52
[Music]

1692.24 --> 1696.799
he prayed hard for [ __ ] and just ended

1695.52 --> 1699.36
up one

1696.799 --> 1699.36
yeah that's

1699.84 --> 1706.279
that's definitely best internet comment

1702.64 --> 1706.279
of the year award

1716.64 --> 1719.76
balls is nuts

1734.72 --> 1739.84
that heaven is down

1737.039 --> 1739.84
what

1743.679 --> 1747.919
what

1745.6 --> 1751.7199999999998
i have no idea what you're talking about

1747.919 --> 1751.72
casey no man

1774.64 --> 1778.96
wow no balls no that's not how it works

1777.44 --> 1782.159
at all you see

1778.96 --> 1784.159
matthew using the laughing emoji

1782.159 --> 1786.7990000000002
you don't just get a timeout for that

1784.159 --> 1789.679
you only get a timeout for that

1786.799 --> 1792.799
if you use it in response

1789.679 --> 1796.0800000000002
to having been utterly defeated in an

1792.799 --> 1800.0
argument and then you're like

1796.08 --> 1800.0
you don't know what you're talking about

1801.36 --> 1804.24
that

1802.72 --> 1807.039
is the type of

1804.24 --> 1808.64
three smileys that i would typically ban

1807.039 --> 1811.36
somebody for

1808.64 --> 1814.88
or rather give them a timeout

1811.36 --> 1816.4799999999998
but he was just actually laughing over a

1814.88 --> 1819.3600000000001
joke

1816.48 --> 1821.2
that yeah i agree is funny

1819.36 --> 1822.8799999999999
so why would he get a timeout for that

1821.2 --> 1826.559
he is not

1822.88 --> 1826.5590000000002
putting on a hahaha

1826.88 --> 1831.8400000000001
smiley protection mask

1829.6 --> 1832.8799999999999
because of his personal defeat in an

1831.84 --> 1834.9599999999998
argument

1832.88 --> 1837.3600000000001
you don't get a timeout unless that's

1834.96 --> 1840.799
the case

1837.36 --> 1840.799
just to clarify that

1845.919 --> 1848.919
uh

1854.399 --> 1858.7199999999998
no balls

1856.799 --> 1860.8799999999999
no

1858.72 --> 1862.799
it makes no sense to say you're gonna

1860.88 --> 1865.1200000000001
pray

1862.799 --> 1867.9189999999999
you don't believe in a god

1865.12 --> 1870.8799999999999
like you're you're like an open atheist

1867.919 --> 1872.64
to say i'm going to pray

1870.88 --> 1874.64
is

1872.64 --> 1876.3200000000002
basically a lie because you don't do

1874.64 --> 1877.2
that you don't because that wouldn't

1876.32 --> 1879.36
work

1877.2 --> 1882.559
what what are you going to pray to

1879.36 --> 1883.9189999999999
what to nothing to the void

1882.559 --> 1886.32
why would you think that would do

1883.919 --> 1886.3200000000002
anything

1890.72 --> 1898.6000000000001
balls

1893.519 --> 1898.6
or did you forget you're an atheist

1910.96 --> 1916.559
how do you blame god for what man does

1913.919 --> 1920.919
or what's the point in even saying that

1916.559 --> 1920.9189999999999
if you don't believe there is a god

1921.279 --> 1925.6
it's like oh no no no when it comes to

1923.84 --> 1926.8799999999999
my personal beliefs i don't believe he's

1925.6 --> 1928.08
real

1926.88 --> 1930.96
but

1928.08 --> 1933.76
i will assume he's real

1930.96 --> 1935.32
when i talk about people that believe

1933.76 --> 1936.96
him that's

1935.32 --> 1940.519
[Music]

1936.96 --> 1940.519
not very cohesive

1952.399 --> 1956.4799999999998
you pray to the sun like the dress

1957.12 --> 1963.84
yeah that's weird i don't know why like

1960.08 --> 1965.1999999999998
why would you do that praying to the son

1963.84 --> 1967.6789999999999
like as what

1965.2 --> 1970.0
like are you gonna then focus on jesus

1967.679 --> 1971.6000000000001
christ and how you think it is literally

1970.0 --> 1974.24
the sun and

1971.6 --> 1977.84
like i don't even understand how that

1974.24 --> 1977.84
prayer to the son would work

1977.919 --> 1982.88
as far as i know prayer is a purely

1980.0 --> 1984.32
internal process

1982.88 --> 1987.679
that's the point

1984.32 --> 1991.039
not to you don't pray staring

1987.679 --> 1994.3990000000001
at something in the 3d world

1991.039 --> 1997.279
you look inside

1994.399 --> 2000.4799999999998
your focus on what your

1997.279 --> 2000.48
yeah what you want

2002.24 --> 2006.799
to be

2003.36 --> 2008.8799999999999
energized or supported or restored or

2006.799 --> 2011.8799999999999
whatever

2008.88 --> 2011.88
internally

2033.84 --> 2038.799
ancient smith syndromed npcs

2043.12 --> 2048.64
it's like post-traumatic agent

2045.44 --> 2048.64
possession syndrome

2048.96 --> 2051.2
like

2051.44 --> 2055.919
npcs that get possessed in the matrix

2054.24 --> 2058.0
right by agents

2055.919 --> 2059.919
and then if the agent like leaves them

2058.0 --> 2062.32
again they're all traumatized and

2059.919 --> 2064.48
scrambled up

2062.32 --> 2067.8
that's an interesting concept that was

2064.48 --> 2067.8
never addressed

2096.8 --> 2101.0
what are you talking about

2104.32 --> 2107.32
uh

2119.839 --> 2125.839
thanks no

2121.76 --> 2130.28

2125.839 --> 2130.2799999999997
or should i just call you mark smiler

2136.56 --> 2142.0789999999997
like you're always trying to just switch

2139.76 --> 2144.96
[ __ ] around

2142.079 --> 2148.0
you're such a reversed world wizard man

2144.96 --> 2150.56
i'm not falling for your [ __ ] anymore

2148.0 --> 2152.24
because everything you've ever done was

2150.56 --> 2155.44
just try to

2152.24 --> 2158.56
lure people into your secrecy

2155.44 --> 2161.44
personal space and then just

2158.56 --> 2163.839
blabber weird [ __ ] towards them to kind

2161.44 --> 2166.48
of make them think reversed will switch

2163.839 --> 2169.119
around things it's weird you're weird

2166.48 --> 2169.119
and creepy

2170.839 --> 2176.0789999999997
