[Music]

50.8 --> 54.879
good

52.16 --> 56.959999999999994
morning welcome to flat earth early bird

54.879 --> 59.199
number 743

56.96 --> 61.039
i'm your host irwin and before we start

59.199 --> 62.8
the show please don't forget to share it

61.039 --> 64.879
on any platform you deem fit

62.8 --> 66.96
and if you haven't already subscribe to

64.879 --> 69.2
my channel and hit the bell notification

66.96 --> 70.479
so you know when i'm going live which is

69.2 --> 73.43900000000001
normally 1pm

70.479 --> 75.439
amsterdam time every day yeah very late

73.439 --> 77.75899999999999
today i'll explain later

75.439 --> 79.439
uh please also do support me through

77.759 --> 81.43900000000001
paypal patreon the super chat and the

79.439 --> 84.96
membership system join button

81.439 --> 88.63999999999999
that'll be much appreciated all right

84.96 --> 92.55999999999999
so i had put my alarm clock on

88.64 --> 93.68
12 o'clock today and i thought okay okay

92.56 --> 96.799
i just need

93.68 --> 100.64
two more minutes and then i woke up

96.799 --> 104.07900000000001
one and a half hour later

100.64 --> 106.799
that yeah i have an excuse

104.079 --> 107.759
sort of it was a very late night last

106.799 --> 110.159
night like past

107.759 --> 112.479
five there's so much stuff keeping me

110.159 --> 112.479
busy

112.84 --> 119.2
chats streams

116.079 --> 120.399
that yeah at some point if i just don't

119.2 --> 122.64
get enough sleep

120.399 --> 124.479
because i basically stay up too late and

122.64 --> 125.2
then even though i want to get up at 12

124.479 --> 126.64
or something

125.2 --> 128.31900000000002
my body's just gonna say yeah that's

126.64 --> 131.599
very freaking cute

128.319 --> 133.11999999999998
but yeah you slept too late

131.599 --> 135.04
you went to bed too late so you're

133.12 --> 137.04
literally now going to catch that up

135.04 --> 139.35999999999999
and we don't care about your schedule

137.04 --> 141.28
that seriously it's not even a joke that

139.36 --> 145.76000000000002
[ __ ] just happens

141.28 --> 145.76
and it's happened to much more extreme

146.0 --> 152.959
to bigger extremes in the past so like

149.12 --> 153.92000000000002
went just stayed up until eight and then

152.959 --> 157.28
thought like i get

153.92 --> 159.44
up at 12 o'clock no no

157.28 --> 159.44
no

160.4 --> 163.59900000000002
you just get up at four o'clock just

163.04 --> 167.84
happens

163.599 --> 171.44
so i'm gonna try to

167.84 --> 173.28
make sure that i don't go to bed that

171.44 --> 174.56
late anymore it's really annoying for me

173.28 --> 177.68
too

174.56 --> 180.159
and that now nathan has missed his show

177.68 --> 182.84
because yeah nathan says to me that he

180.159 --> 186.0
really watches the first

182.84 --> 189.599
hour so i'm sorry

186.0 --> 189.599
for depriving you of that nathan

193.92 --> 200.79999999999998
all right so huh tara

197.599 --> 203.599
was first like he was waiting before i

200.8 --> 207.84
even said good morning

203.599 --> 211.11999999999998
and krusty cindy

207.84 --> 213.12
lou all right got a lot of notes

211.12 --> 215.68
because there was a lot happening

213.12 --> 215.68
yesterday

216.879 --> 221.76
and i even realized something new guys

219.76 --> 226.959
it's pretty intense

221.76 --> 230.0
i realized something very interesting

226.959 --> 232.159
like i figured out another part of the

230.0 --> 234.72
magician's trick of the globers

232.159 --> 236.879
through nasa that i never realized

234.72 --> 239.84
before i never realized this

236.879 --> 241.28
i realized that during the chat at over

239.84 --> 244.48
at nathan's i said it

241.28 --> 244.48
nathan said yeah

245.2 --> 255.76
because i'm probably right at that

249.2 --> 258.079
right oh

255.76 --> 259.12
what it comes down to is that in a vomit

258.079 --> 261.6
comet setup

259.12 --> 263.68
it basically relates to relative density

261.6 --> 265.52000000000004
and my show yesterday i watched my show

263.68 --> 268.72
back yesterday the entire thing

265.52 --> 269.44
it was damn good i'm really satisfied

268.72 --> 273.28000000000003
about it

269.44 --> 274.71999999999997
i like my attitude i liked what i said

273.28 --> 277.67999999999995
how i explained it

274.72 --> 279.36
i'm very happy with yesterday's show so

277.68 --> 280.16
if you haven't watched it go and watch

279.36 --> 283.28000000000003
it

280.16 --> 285.6
it was good right they explained

283.28 --> 287.52
relative density to no end and even drew

285.6 --> 290.639
in the vomit comet

287.52 --> 293.75899999999996
diving plane situation and how

290.639 --> 297.36
uh yeah solids and liquids

293.759 --> 299.759
would basically fall

297.36 --> 300.96000000000004
with the entire medium and the plane

299.759 --> 302.72
itself

300.96 --> 306.08
so that it would seem during that whole

302.72 --> 307.759
period like there is no

306.08 --> 309.59999999999997
like there is no relative density like

307.759 --> 312.16
it's neutralized

309.6 --> 314.0
but here's the thing i figured it out i

312.16 --> 317.6
just came to it

314.0 --> 320.96
if in that setup there would be

317.6 --> 322.56
a let's just say a helium balloon

320.96 --> 324.96
present somewhere

322.56 --> 326.16
maybe it's probably wisest to put them

324.96 --> 330.23999999999995
on

326.16 --> 333.759
on a rope if you go in there right

330.24 --> 337.44
well guess what that balloon

333.759 --> 340.8
is not going to be floaty neutral

337.44 --> 342.0
huh ever thought about that no no no

340.8 --> 342.56
what the balloon is going to do it's

342.0 --> 345.28
going to

342.56 --> 347.44
shoot back with extreme speed and

345.28 --> 351.11999999999995
violence to the back

347.44 --> 353.199
while the rock and a bit of water just

351.12 --> 355.44
floats and bubblies

353.199 --> 358.24
hangs there right yeah that helium

355.44 --> 358.24
balloon is going to

358.72 --> 364.8
probably burst open right at the back

361.759 --> 367.52000000000004
because of the violence it's going to

364.8 --> 368.8
move towards the back of the plane have

367.52 --> 371.75899999999996
you ever thought about that

368.8 --> 373.36
yes it would stone monkey 3d yes it

371.759 --> 375.52000000000004
would you know why

373.36 --> 378.0
you know why because it's not at this

375.52 --> 381.44
equilib it's not at equilibrium

378.0 --> 384.8
with the air in the plane yeah

381.44 --> 386.479
it's not it never will be it's never

384.8 --> 388.72
going to be in any fashion

386.479 --> 391.44
and the whole thing is going down now

388.72 --> 396.16
the balloon would naturally

391.44 --> 398.639
go up right where the actual up

396.16 --> 400.40000000000003
not what appears to be up in the plane

398.639 --> 402.319
and when you dive there it appears to be

400.4 --> 404.23999999999995
no more up and down it's all neutral

402.319 --> 405.28000000000003
supposedly right well there is still up

404.24 --> 408.24
it's going down

405.28 --> 409.11999999999995
it's diving down and so the balloon will

408.24 --> 410.88
go up

409.12 --> 413.44
but because it's already going down it

410.88 --> 417.68
will want to go up even faster

413.44 --> 419.12
yeah yeah stone monkey 3d yeah it will

417.68 --> 420.88
why don't you try it out why don't you

419.12 --> 424.4
bring a helium balloon

420.88 --> 428.96
in the vomit comet if they allow that

424.4 --> 432.63899999999995
then you can see it yeah yeah yeah

428.96 --> 437.84
yeah ah

432.639 --> 437.84000000000003
magician's trick broken

440.97 --> 444.17900000000003
[Music]

449.28 --> 456.79999999999995
ah hello brent m by the way

453.12 --> 458.96
cameron gilmore and a koala and stone

456.8 --> 461.54
monkey 3d

458.96 --> 464.729
no it wouldn't come on guys

461.54 --> 464.72900000000004
[Music]

467.52 --> 472.4
sure because it's just falling you know

470.879 --> 474.8
because that's what a vomit comet is

472.4 --> 476.96
it's false everything's falling

474.8 --> 479.599
yeah a healing balloon is just going to

476.96 --> 484.15999999999997
stay neutral too

479.599 --> 484.15999999999997
sure try it out sometime

485.28 --> 489.52
i'd love to test it i'm just happy that

487.599 --> 493.52
i predicted it before this

489.52 --> 497.12
would actually be tested because now

493.52 --> 499.039
it will be the proof that i actually do

497.12 --> 500.8
know what the [ __ ] i'm talking about

499.039 --> 502.08
even though i haven't actually seen a

500.8 --> 504.8
demonstration yet

502.08 --> 506.0
i just figured it out through logic

504.8 --> 509.44
through the logic that

506.0 --> 512.159
i have built through my mechanical

509.44 --> 514.959
conception of how reality works

512.159 --> 516.7189999999999
and i'm really [ __ ] good at it and if

514.959 --> 519.5989999999999
you can't handle that

516.719 --> 520.88
then just go squirt in a corner because

519.599 --> 524.159
i'm calling it

520.88 --> 525.6
this is real it happens it will happen

524.159 --> 528.0
and at some point it's going to be

525.6 --> 529.839
tested somebody is going to take a

528.0 --> 532.08
helium balloon in there

529.839 --> 534.399
and then they are going to see as it

532.08 --> 537.2
shoots off to the back while

534.399 --> 538.56
a rock and a glass of water are just

537.2 --> 540.88
gonna float mid-air

538.56 --> 541.5999999999999
yeah they're gonna see that maybe film

540.88 --> 545.68
it

541.6 --> 545.6800000000001
and then you'll have the demonstration

546.8 --> 554.24
yeah bubbles stone monkey

550.399 --> 558.399
bubbles are not helium balloons

554.24 --> 560.399
bubbles are air of the medium

558.399 --> 561.68
yeah they are not going to shoot to the

560.399 --> 563.92
back

561.68 --> 566.16
no it's actually the soap that is

563.92 --> 570.0799999999999
slightly denser

566.16 --> 572.8
the soap bubble the slight denser bubble

570.08 --> 574.0
right than the air that's going to flow

572.8 --> 577.04
down just like when you

574.0 --> 578.88
blow a soap bubble it's gonna go some

577.04 --> 581.1999999999999
direction and then eventually

578.88 --> 583.36
go down and pop yeah yeah that's because

581.2 --> 586.6400000000001
it's not filled with helium

583.36 --> 590.399
stone monkey 3d oh really

586.64 --> 593.1999999999999
oh really so bubbles

590.399 --> 594.16
filled with helium right right stone

593.2 --> 597.2
monkey

594.16 --> 598.399
sure sure they're bubbles and they're

597.2 --> 601.76
not a soap

598.399 --> 605.44
of course air bubbles in water

601.76 --> 609.92
oh that's very very cute

605.44 --> 612.9590000000001
it's still going to be the same density

609.92 --> 614.56
as the medium of air that is in the

612.959 --> 617.76
plane

614.56 --> 619.76
so it has no relevance whatsoever to

617.76 --> 623.12
anything i said

619.76 --> 626.079
but please keep on squirming

623.12 --> 627.839
out the truth figure it out try to

626.079 --> 628.56
figure it out how it can still be a

627.839 --> 633.839
globe

628.56 --> 633.8389999999999
by all means do that

641.44 --> 644.72
yeah i know you don't have to tell me

644.079 --> 646.3199999999999
that

644.72 --> 648.64
don't have to tell anybody that

646.32 --> 652.5600000000001
everybody in chat knows that

648.64 --> 655.6
yeah but guess what

652.56 --> 657.1999999999999
in the vomit comet the air that surround

655.6 --> 660.8000000000001
is gonna surround everybody

657.2 --> 664.0
it's air right so it's all very

660.8 --> 666.16
cute that of water in there and the

664.0 --> 667.76
air bubble in the water and it's all

666.16 --> 671.279
very very nice

667.76 --> 673.519
if you put a helium balloon in there

671.279 --> 674.72
doesn't matter where that thing's going

673.519 --> 677.76
to shoot to the back

674.72 --> 680.8000000000001
really quickly yeah up

677.76 --> 684.48
up because technically to the back is

680.8 --> 686.959
up so as all these objects water

684.48 --> 688.72
freeze apparent seemingly free floating

686.959 --> 692.0
water is seemingly

688.72 --> 695.12
free-floating rock yeah it's all very

692.0 --> 696.56
cute a helium balloon is going to shoot

695.12 --> 699.92
to the back

696.56 --> 702.079
yes it will yes it will

699.92 --> 702.959
and i'm timing you out now because you

702.079 --> 704.43
are starting to

702.959 --> 707.7199999999999
piss me off

704.43 --> 707.7199999999999
[Music]

707.76 --> 712.0
stop spamming my chat with your denial

710.48 --> 715.6800000000001
if you can't handle it then just

712.0 --> 718.639
get get get away from me

715.68 --> 719.519
yeah you don't know what the [ __ ] you're

718.639 --> 723.279
talking about

719.519 --> 724.639
i do yeah nobody's ever demonstrated

723.279 --> 726.8
this or even referenced

724.639 --> 728.0790000000001
anything about this yeah so it's just a

726.8 --> 731.04
helium balloon again

728.079 --> 731.92
the helium balloon disproving gravity

731.04 --> 734.56
forever

731.92 --> 735.5999999999999
there is no freaking globe earth stone

734.56 --> 740.079
monkey 3d

735.6 --> 742.88
get the [ __ ] over it you're not smart

740.079 --> 744.399
you're a dumbass and you're addicted to

742.88 --> 747.6
your freaking globe

744.399 --> 750.8
yeah so contain your addiction

747.6 --> 752.0
and stop spamming in my chat like like

750.8 --> 753.92
what i said is wrong

752.0 --> 755.279
you don't have the proof for that you

753.92 --> 755.8389999999999
don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking

755.279 --> 758.16
about

755.839 --> 759.7600000000001
so get the [ __ ] out if you keep on

758.16 --> 763.04
spamming your [ __ ]

759.76 --> 763.04
okay sound monkey 3d

766.079 --> 770.4799999999999
what kind of a question is that earth

767.839 --> 770.48
passenger

771.36 --> 775.44
it's a device it's been done you can

774.16 --> 777.8389999999999
literally pay

775.44 --> 778.8000000000001
them money and they'll put you in that

777.839 --> 781.839
plane

778.8 --> 782.56
to experience it yourself yeah and at

781.839 --> 785.6800000000001
some point

782.56 --> 787.5999999999999
somebody's gonna pay them to do that and

785.68 --> 789.279
then demand to take a helium balloon

787.6 --> 791.36
with them

789.279 --> 792.56
and they might accept it or they might

791.36 --> 794.48
not

792.56 --> 796.4799999999999
right i don't know i don't know what

794.48 --> 798.8000000000001
their policy is for helium balloons in

796.48 --> 800.9590000000001
that process i don't know

798.8 --> 802.0
but i'm pretty damn sure that if you got

800.959 --> 804.3199999999999
one in there

802.0 --> 807.6
it's gonna shoot to the back as soon as

804.32 --> 809.9200000000001
you get the supposed neutral

807.6 --> 812.24
there the density neutral situation

809.92 --> 815.279
happening

812.24 --> 818.0790000000001
right that's gonna happen

815.279 --> 818.079
i predict it

820.8 --> 824.3199999999999
it is gonna happen i guarantee it it has

823.6 --> 826.639
to

824.32 --> 827.519
because relative density it works the

826.639 --> 830.72
way it works

827.519 --> 834.72
always has always will

830.72 --> 834.72
and that's just the natural result

835.04 --> 841.68
right so yeah scoring for me globers

838.24 --> 842.24
get the [ __ ] out stop spamming deal with

841.68 --> 844.399
it

842.24 --> 846.0790000000001
yeah i discovered it figured it out

844.399 --> 848.8
that's gonna happen

846.079 --> 849.279
now [ __ ] deal with it your globe is

848.8 --> 853.199
dead

849.279 --> 855.8389999999999
you have nothing nothing nothing

853.199 --> 856.88
your model is not even complete it's

855.839 --> 859.6800000000001
riddled with holes

856.88 --> 861.36
even within the conceptual world your

859.68 --> 864.16
globe model doesn't work

861.36 --> 866.32
alright you got nothing you got nothing

864.16 --> 868.3199999999999
but a bunch of fantasy stories

866.32 --> 871.279
and people telling you you have to trust

868.32 --> 874.5600000000001

1277.12 --> 1284.4799999999998
not even because he's so evil

1280.64 --> 1288.159
it's just so unbelievably sad

1284.48 --> 1291.44
that he would actually just abandon

disappointed because for the first time

1331.28 --> 1335.6
yesterday

1332.88 --> 1337.2800000000002
samson basically shared some things and

1335.6 --> 1339.4399999999998
he linked me up and it's like okay okay

1337.28 --> 1343.52
i'm gonna look at this

1343.52 --> 1349.76
oh my god is that's it that's not

1346.96 --> 1351.3600000000001

this tony guy is like

1360.159 --> 1365.679
such a [ __ ] it's unbelievable

1363.2 --> 1366.32
like every freaking globe or i've ever

1365.679 --> 1368.64
met

1366.32 --> 1369.84
is a bigger threat than this guy he is

1368.64 --> 1373.1200000000001
just a pathetic

1369.84 --> 1376.72
sack of [ __ ] i can't believe

1373.12 --> 1381.6789999999999
he even has anybody following him at all

1376.72 --> 1381.679
it's really sad yeah

1383.28 --> 1388.559
yeah that's really cute stone monkey 3d

1386.24 --> 1390.08
i know a helium balloon can definitely

1388.559 --> 1394.08
fall in a vacuum

1390.08 --> 1398.559
i know i know yeah a vomit comet

1394.08 --> 1402.559
is not a vacuum-filled plane though

1398.559 --> 1406.32
yeah yeah cause

1402.559 --> 1409.52
planes can be made into vacuum chambers

1406.32 --> 1413.28
it's not in a vacuum oh sure it's not

1409.52 --> 1417.52
sure yeah yeah okay guys

1413.28 --> 1420.1589999999999
we got it stone monkey 3d has the proof

1417.52 --> 1420.799
that helium balloons go down go boom

1420.159 --> 1423.7600000000002
boom

1420.799 --> 1424.96
oh my god the earth is not flat after

1423.76 --> 1427.6
all because

1424.96 --> 1429.1200000000001
he thinks that a helium balloon goes

1427.6 --> 1432.7199999999998
down

1429.12 --> 1436.3999999999999
oh of course it's not a

1432.72 --> 1439.1200000000001
setup at all it's what just breaks

1436.4 --> 1440.4
every consistency of matter that we've

1439.12 --> 1443.279
figured out so far

1440.4 --> 1445.76
like everywhere all the time in any

1443.279 --> 1448.48
scenario that's all stone monkey 3d

1445.76 --> 1449.279
he's he's got it yeah relative density's

1448.48 --> 1451.44
debunked

1449.279 --> 1453.12
because he found a video where helium

1451.44 --> 1456.96
balloons go down go

1453.12 --> 1460.6399999999999
boom boom and it's not in a vacuum oh

1456.96 --> 1463.919
sure sure you did

1460.64 --> 1465.3600000000001
of course you did stone monkey yeah

1463.919 --> 1467.44
you know what why don't you go to the

1465.36 --> 1469.9189999999999
flat earth debate discord

1467.44 --> 1472.3200000000002
and then post your precious helium

1469.919 --> 1475.039
balloon go down go boom boom video

1472.32 --> 1476.799
in the discord chat there why don't you

1475.039 --> 1478.72
yeah

1476.799 --> 1480.799
why don't you go and do that and just

1478.72 --> 1487.679
shut up about this nonsense bro

1480.799 --> 1491.84
this is really embarrassing right

1487.679 --> 1495.1200000000001
so anyway the gravy reset

1491.84 --> 1498.32
it's coming and

1495.12 --> 1501.9599999999998
yeah those that

1498.32 --> 1504.96
obsess with slavery to the

1501.96 --> 1507.52
hierarchical evil new world order

1504.96 --> 1509.8400000000001
yeah they will be reset and they will

1507.52 --> 1512.08
probably lose a lot including parts of

1509.84 --> 1514.48
their soul and their sovereignty

1512.08 --> 1517.039
but those that don't they're going to go

1514.48 --> 1519.2
into the gravy reset

1517.039 --> 1522.24
and they're actually going to bloom up

1519.2 --> 1524.4
in full sovereignty more than ever

1522.24 --> 1526.08
and that's the gravy reset so as the

1524.4 --> 1528.72
great reset happens

1526.08 --> 1529.279
people that engage become part of the

1528.72 --> 1532.4
deeper

1529.279 --> 1535.52
slave mechanism

1532.4 --> 1538.4
the people independent will also

1535.52 --> 1539.6
go through their own reset they will

1538.4 --> 1542.799
reset

1539.6 --> 1544.48
their new logos driven engagement with

1542.799 --> 1547.52
the world and god

1544.48 --> 1550.159
and they will go through the gravy reset

1547.52 --> 1551.36
they will be showered by energy and

1550.159 --> 1554.72
spirit

1551.36 --> 1557.84
and prosperity

1554.72 --> 1560.88
through their works their gravy reset

1557.84 --> 1561.52
right i didn't want to mention that so

1560.88 --> 1563.6000000000001
after that

1561.52 --> 1565.679
i i caught a little bit of rodrigo

1563.6 --> 1569.12
ferrari nunes

1565.679 --> 1571.1200000000001
uh he was doing a stream and i yeah i

1569.12 --> 1574.2399999999998
usually hang around there

1571.12 --> 1576.1589999999999
you know and chat just talk and address

1574.24 --> 1576.799
the subject because i like his streams

1576.159 --> 1579.0390000000002
and

1576.799 --> 1581.279
i've been used to basically commenting

1579.039 --> 1582.96
in there it's been pretty good

1581.279 --> 1585.039
i don't know why but certainly i'm

1582.96 --> 1587.279
blocked there i got in there

1585.039 --> 1589.6
my sentences did not get through so

1587.279 --> 1592.559
somebody pre-blocked me

1589.6 --> 1593.279
now you all know who's driven that to

1592.559 --> 1597.52
happen

1593.279 --> 1599.279
right right and i got indeed

1597.52 --> 1601.039
and then i continued some chatting there

1599.279 --> 1604.159
and the people there at least

1601.039 --> 1606.799
were able to see me but and there's like

1604.159 --> 1609.279
this bot system where youtube will relay

1606.799 --> 1610.8799999999999
its messages into d live and d life will

1609.279 --> 1614.0
relay its messages

1610.88 --> 1616.7990000000002
into the youtube and for some reason my

1614.0 --> 1619.2
messages would not be relayed so i guess

1616.799 --> 1620.96
i'm no longer welcome over at rodrigo

1619.2 --> 1625.039
ferrari nunes

1620.96 --> 1628.4
because bob's got his dick up his ass

1625.039 --> 1632.48
right and he's just a [ __ ] slave

1628.4 --> 1633.2
to him now or maybe he just thought it's

1632.48 --> 1635.679
better to

1633.2 --> 1637.279
morally completely agree with everything

1635.679 --> 1639.6000000000001
bob says because it makes so much

1637.279 --> 1641.6
freaking sense and i'm evil now

1639.6 --> 1643.52
so let's just block me let's just not

1641.6 --> 1645.4399999999998
mention my name in your chat again even

1643.52 --> 1646.8799999999999
though i'm probably the most active

1645.44 --> 1648.88
person there ever

1646.88 --> 1650.0
you've ever met and you've addressed me

1648.88 --> 1652.0800000000002
many times before

1650.0 --> 1654.559
but now if you say my name if it's

1652.08 --> 1655.1999999999998
visible yeah you know oh god that

1654.559 --> 1657.36
freaking

1655.2 --> 1659.76
bob the cave troll's gonna get triggered

1657.36 --> 1661.6789999999999
again so i totally get it i forgive you

1659.76 --> 1664.24
rodrigo ferrari nunes

1661.679 --> 1664.88
i used to like your streams being part

1664.24 --> 1666.96
of it

1664.88 --> 1668.0800000000002
but i know you're afraid of me now

1666.96 --> 1670.3990000000001
because i might

1668.08 --> 1671.4399999999998
trigger the cave troll to start bashing

1670.399 --> 1673.1999999999998
in

1671.44 --> 1675.44
your works again and make your life

1673.2 --> 1678.96
miserable i know i'm sorry man

1675.44 --> 1679.6000000000001
i'm really sorry sorry you had to go

1678.96 --> 1681.279
through that

1679.6 --> 1682.6399999999999
and i know you're not strong enough to

1681.279 --> 1684.399
really stand on your own

1682.64 --> 1685.919
yeah you can't deal with the cave troll

1684.399 --> 1689.039
i understand

1685.919 --> 1693.679
yeah right and then

1689.039 --> 1695.6
as a the top the crown

1693.679 --> 1697.44
achievement of the day this was really

1695.6 --> 1699.4399999999998
fun it was really late too

1697.44 --> 1700.96
this is part of the reason i got up so

1699.44 --> 1705.6000000000001
late

1700.96 --> 1709.52
kent hovind went live kent hovind the

1705.6 --> 1710.48
the creationist the intelligent design

1709.52 --> 1715.279
guy

1710.48 --> 1716.559
right christian and glober oh yeah is he

1715.279 --> 1718.72
a freaking global it's

1716.559 --> 1719.6
really weird it's really weird and he

1718.72 --> 1723.3600000000001
had like this

1719.6 --> 1725.6789999999999
total globe party

1723.36 --> 1728.0
like a little boy and he was just like

1725.679 --> 1730.0800000000002
speculating the [ __ ] out of how things

1728.0 --> 1730.96
work and talking about the molten iron

1730.08 --> 1733.9189999999999
core and how it

1730.96 --> 1735.44
influenced magnetism he went so far with

1733.919 --> 1738.0800000000002
that globe nonsense [ __ ]

1735.44 --> 1739.44
so far that i just could not stand by

1738.08 --> 1743.039
anymore and not just

1739.44 --> 1746.559
say like uh hey kent

1743.039 --> 1747.84
did you know that molten iron is past a

1746.559 --> 1750.84
curie point

1747.84 --> 1754.32
which means it's no longer viable or

1750.84 --> 1757.12
susceptible to magnetism it cannot carry

1754.32 --> 1758.799
magnetism okay it cannot cause it if

1757.12 --> 1760.08
it's past the curing point which is

1758.799 --> 1762.0
after it's molten

1760.08 --> 1764.1589999999999
so yeah what you're talking about is

1762.0 --> 1766.799
complete nonsense

1764.159 --> 1768.96
the magnetism in the world is not caused

1766.799 --> 1771.44
by this molten iron core as you say

1768.96 --> 1772.559
it does and he just went on from there

1771.44 --> 1776.0800000000002
on and

1772.559 --> 1776.08
aggravated the whole thing

1777.84 --> 1784.08
it was really silly

1781.2 --> 1786.159
but it was fun i shared it with uh with

1784.08 --> 1788.6399999999999
a couple of guys at the skype chat and

1786.159 --> 1792.7990000000002
then adam meekin joined in too

1788.64 --> 1792.7990000000002
because oh god like literally

1793.6 --> 1800.24
oh kent hovind boy

1796.72 --> 1800.88
is that guy balls deep in it you know he

1800.24 --> 1804.32
is

1800.88 --> 1806.48
he's so deep into that ball he even

1804.32 --> 1809.52
brought up the coriolis effect

1806.48 --> 1810.72
like the ball version of the coriolis

1809.52 --> 1813.9189999999999
effect it was so

1810.72 --> 1816.24
silly with photos and all like yeah

1813.919 --> 1818.0
the coriolis effect on the earth it

1816.24 --> 1822.32
proved the earth is spinning

1818.0 --> 1824.559
oh god oh

1822.32 --> 1825.84
that guy obviously did not watch the

1824.559 --> 1828.6399999999999
flat earth debate

1825.84 --> 1829.76
this is yeah was quite funny wasn't it

1828.64 --> 1832.88
at a making

1829.76 --> 1835.6
correcting kent it was funny

1832.88 --> 1837.1200000000001
and we did it for like 15 minutes and

1835.6 --> 1839.279
then he ended the stream

1837.12 --> 1841.76
it was like okay let's look at the chat

1839.279 --> 1841.76
he said

1841.84 --> 1846.72
oh i see there's some people in here

1843.44 --> 1846.72
well i'm gonna round it out

1848.84 --> 1855.84
click

1850.48 --> 1855.84
oh god that was amazing

1856.62 --> 1864.799
[Music]

1859.279 --> 1867.44
hey dark steve 84.

1864.799 --> 1869.9189999999999
all right so i had a very busy day

1867.44 --> 1873.679
yesterday

1869.919 --> 1877.039
and for today i had a yeah

1873.679 --> 1877.76
the little concept ready to go i already

1877.039 --> 1880.799
explained it

1877.76 --> 1880.799
relative density

1880.88 --> 1886.88
in the vomit comet where liquids

1884.64 --> 1888.3200000000002
like water and a rock or some other

1886.88 --> 1891.2
object will

1888.32 --> 1892.24
fall with the accelerating downward

1891.2 --> 1895.1200000000001
plane

1892.24 --> 1897.279
in order to cause an uh and what appears

1895.12 --> 1898.7199999999998
to be a neutralization of the relative

1897.279 --> 1900.96
density displacement

1898.72 --> 1903.2
this is false however because if in that

1900.96 --> 1906.3990000000001
same scenario you would

1903.2 --> 1906.96
have a balloon filled with helium in the

1906.399 --> 1910.0
same

1906.96 --> 1912.48
space within the vomit comet room

1910.0 --> 1914.159
that balloon would not just regularly

1912.48 --> 1916.24
float around because effectively the

1914.159 --> 1917.7600000000002
relative density isn't neutralized it's

1916.24 --> 1920.96
just that the entire

1917.76 --> 1923.519
medium in which these fr

1920.96 --> 1924.559
flee yeah these objects are falling is

1923.519 --> 1927.2
falling with it

1924.559 --> 1928.32
causing an effective what apparent

1927.2 --> 1929.8400000000001
neutralization

1928.32 --> 1931.039
and guess what a helium balloon is not

1929.84 --> 1932.32
just going to float there you know it's

1931.039 --> 1935.36
going to shoot

1932.32 --> 1938.399
violently to the back

1935.36 --> 1940.4799999999998
probably burst open from the impact

1938.399 --> 1941.76
that's what's gonna happen i predict

1940.48 --> 1944.24
this

1941.76 --> 1945.919
i pretty much can guarantee you this is

1944.24 --> 1948.159
fact

1945.919 --> 1949.1200000000001
i have not demonstrated it i just know

1948.159 --> 1951.8400000000001
this is gonna happen

1949.12 --> 1952.8799999999999
it makes perfect sense and i'd love for

1951.84 --> 1956.72
somebody

1952.88 --> 1958.72
to actually try that out at some point

1956.72 --> 1961.919
it's kind of expensive though the vomit

1958.72 --> 1962.48
comment and i don't know if they allow

1961.919 --> 1964.3990000000001
people

1962.48 --> 1966.64
to bring a helium balloon with them

1964.399 --> 1967.12
could be that they specifically forbid

1966.64 --> 1971.679
it

1967.12 --> 1974.7199999999998
for mysterious reasons perhaps

1971.679 --> 1977.2
i don't know maybe they do allow it

1974.72 --> 1978.0
maybe just nobody ever tried i don't

1977.2 --> 1979.76
know

1978.0 --> 1981.36
but i'm pretty sure that whatever is

1979.76 --> 1982.8799999999999
going to be falling in there

1981.36 --> 1984.32
the helium balloon is going to do

1982.88 --> 1986.3200000000002
exactly the opposite it's going to try

1984.32 --> 1989.36
to find its equilibrium

1986.32 --> 1992.48
within the medium even as it is falling

1989.36 --> 1993.039
which means that yeah it's it's not

1992.48 --> 1995.519
going to go

1993.039 --> 1996.96
down in an accelerated fashion as more

1995.519 --> 1997.519
dense objects will know it's going to

1996.96 --> 2000.88
actually

1997.519 --> 2002.48
shoot in the other direction in a medium

2000.88 --> 2002.7990000000002
that's already falling so it's going to

2002.48 --> 2004.64
go

2002.799 --> 2006.799
double speed the other direction

2004.64 --> 2009.679
potentially burst open as it hits the

2006.799 --> 2009.679
back of the plane

2012.32 --> 2016.96
uh dude

2015.519 --> 2020.559
what the [ __ ] is your problem your

2016.96 --> 2020.559
[ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of here

2023.2 --> 2033.8400000000001
what the hell is this

2033.919 --> 2041.1200000000001
what the that's

2037.76 --> 2043.279
insane i banned him

2041.12 --> 2046.7199999999998
but the freaking message was still up

2043.279 --> 2051.679
that makes no freaking sense

2046.72 --> 2054.32
that is really weird anyway yeah

2051.679 --> 2056.56
yeah i think it's tony he is a pathetic

2054.32 --> 2057.44
sack of [ __ ] and needs to go [ __ ] off

2056.56 --> 2061.2799999999997
himself and

2057.44 --> 2063.599
piss off you lame ass [ __ ]

2061.28 --> 2066.96
you don't even know the terminologies

2063.599 --> 2070.8
you're using your pathetic sack of [ __ ]

2066.96 --> 2074.0
you uneducated troll demon goblin

2070.8 --> 2076.96
[ __ ] actually

2074.0 --> 2077.679
calling you a goblin demon at this point

2076.96 --> 2081.44
is not

2077.679 --> 2083.839
even is not even accurate because that

2081.44 --> 2087.599
means that you have some kind of energy

2083.839 --> 2091.44
now you are just a pathetic sad

2087.599 --> 2094.159
lame ass sack of [ __ ]

2091.44 --> 2094.639
you're not even demon you are just a

2094.159 --> 2098.2400000000002
[ __ ]

2094.639 --> 2101.6800000000003
lazy ass dumbass [ __ ]

2098.24 --> 2105.9199999999996
no spirit no spunk

2101.68 --> 2110.72
no no sensibility nothing interesting

2105.92 --> 2113.92
there only a freaking [ __ ] dumbass

2110.72 --> 2116.16
adiq less loser is

2113.92 --> 2117.76
ever going to follow you because they

2116.16 --> 2118.16
have nothing better to do in their life

2117.76 --> 2121.92
because

2118.16 --> 2125.68
your shows are lame

2121.92 --> 2129.2000000000003
really [ __ ] lame so

2125.68 --> 2131.04
yeah go [ __ ] yourself get the [ __ ] out

2129.2 --> 2132.56
i'm gonna delete every [ __ ] sock of

2131.04 --> 2137.92
you because you are a [ __ ]

2132.56 --> 2137.92
[ __ ] a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2138.4 --> 2147.829
nobody needs you

2144.61 --> 2147.829
[Music]

2153.55 --> 2158.5600000000004
[Music]

2156.839 --> 2161.839
ugh

2158.56 --> 2162.64
i know i know it's passenger but i i'd

2161.839 --> 2165.92
like to just

2162.64 --> 2168.16
rub it in first a little like really rub

2165.92 --> 2170.88
it in

2168.16 --> 2172.0789999999997
like sandpaper on his heart till it

2170.88 --> 2175.119
starts bleeding

2172.079 --> 2178.48
just rub it in you know because he

2175.119 --> 2182.88
is so [ __ ] lame

2178.48 --> 2186.48
it's like like i wouldn't do this to

2182.88 --> 2187.119
tim osman his channel i just leave him

2186.48 --> 2190.079
alone

2187.119 --> 2192.6400000000003
and he's and he's pretty he gets pretty

2190.079 --> 2195.599
disgusting and all that

2192.64 --> 2198.56
yeah well i respect him more than this

embarrassment right and that doesn't

2330.16 --> 2333.1189999999997
happen

2330.56 --> 2334.4
very often that doesn't even happen with

2333.119 --> 2337.92
a glober

2334.4 --> 2342.1600000000003
they usually just make me laugh right

2337.92 --> 2346.079
this guy is just so embarrassing

2342.16 --> 2346.0789999999997
it literally makes me cringe

2347.2 --> 2350.3999999999996
that rarely happens

2353.2 --> 2357.1189999999997
and i'm a bit embarrassed towards myself

2355.119 --> 2358.6400000000003
that i originally thought that there was

2357.119 --> 2361.92
any level of threat

2358.64 --> 2363.68
in there at all at all now that i've

2361.92 --> 2368.079
actually heard him and saw him

2363.68 --> 2370.16
it's just wow that is the dumbest

2368.079 --> 2374.4
[ __ ] thing i've ever come across on

2383.52 --> 2388.32
who's going to watch that

2385.28 --> 2388.7200000000003
like at the end of that you're literally

2388.32 --> 2392.079
have

2388.72 --> 2396.0
you would have like 40 points iq dropped

2392.079 --> 2396.0
after that it's inevitable

2396.48 --> 2399.92
god who's gonna listen to that guy for

2398.56 --> 2402.7999999999997

i've never had a video of mine

2880.88 --> 2885.2000000000003
taken down except the one time that i

2883.599 --> 2888.8
actually

2885.2 --> 2891.7599999999998
played a video that was

2888.8 --> 2892.079
really high tier disputed at the time

2891.76 --> 2895.3590000000004
like

2892.079 --> 2898.4
the christ church one right i

2895.359 --> 2900.4
addressed it because i addressed it it

2898.4 --> 2901.359
was two videos that were taken down

2900.4 --> 2904.079
because of it

2901.359 --> 2904.72
i've never had a single strike i've

2904.079 --> 2908.559
never had

2904.72 --> 2911.7599999999998
any other video taken down ever

2908.559 --> 2914.6400000000003
and i've gotten rough right yeah my 82

2911.76 --> 2916.0
episode 82 where i went completely ape

2914.64 --> 2918.5589999999997
[ __ ]

2916.0 --> 2919.839
basically started describing slicing

2918.559 --> 2922.4
open people

2919.839 --> 2924.24
and all that [ __ ] because i thought like

2922.4 --> 2925.839
yeah the pedophiles like the pedophiles

2924.24 --> 2927.04
are taking over at some point it's

2925.839 --> 2929.2
everybody's gonna go

2927.04 --> 2931.04
[ __ ] berserk and then i described

2929.2 --> 2932.16
what that would be like the experience

2931.04 --> 2935.119
in full

2932.16 --> 2937.44
full rate yeah i did that it's still

2935.119 --> 2937.44
there

2937.52 --> 2944.16
it's not even demonetized i've had

2941.119 --> 2946.559
zero strikes yeah

2944.16 --> 2948.96
so it's all very cute that people can

2946.559 --> 2950.1600000000003
think that they flag me because oh my

2948.96 --> 2952.559
god he swore

2950.16 --> 2956.8799999999997
he swore guess what that's [ __ ]

2952.559 --> 2960.2400000000002
allowed on youtube

2956.88 --> 2963.92
and my shows are all marked 12 plus

2960.24 --> 2967.1189999999997
so i can do whatever the [ __ ] i want

2963.92 --> 2969.359
right except for well [ __ ] that

2967.119 --> 2970.96
is at all only that would i never would

2969.359 --> 2973.44
do that [ __ ] i'm never gonna do that

2970.96 --> 2975.599
because i have no interest whatsoever in

2973.44 --> 2977.52
providing more squirt material for a

2975.599 --> 2981.599
bunch of [ __ ] out there

2977.52 --> 2984.64

2984.64 --> 2990.0789999999997

2986.48 --> 2992.64
but i'm not gonna help them out right

2990.079 --> 2993.3590000000004
because i am not gay and i don't give a

2992.64 --> 2996.8799999999997
[ __ ] about

2993.359 --> 2999.44
any of that right not interested

2996.88 --> 3001.2000000000003

2999.44 --> 3003.76
whatever i do

3001.2 --> 3005.68
is perfectly in line with that so i'm

that's the time when i really need your

3215.2 --> 3219.04
help on average to deal with people and

3217.52 --> 3223.119
their misbehaviors

3219.04 --> 3225.04
not so much so leave that to me

3223.119 --> 3226.48
especially with people that are sort of

3225.04 --> 3228.4
high profile

3226.48 --> 3237.839
don't ever time them out don't ever ban

3228.4 --> 3237.839
them leave that to me

3242.4 --> 3246.1600000000003
good surfer not doing terribly well

3244.4 --> 3247.599
about showing christian love to everyone

3246.16 --> 3248.0789999999997
i don't know what the hell he's doing

3247.599 --> 3251.52
man

3248.079 --> 3254.88
he's stumbling into the pit and

3251.52 --> 3257.04
like like

3254.88 --> 3258.559
this kind of seems kind of useless like

3257.04 --> 3260.4
okay you're gonna spread the

3258.559 --> 3263.3590000000004
love of christ oh really so you're

3260.4 --> 3265.92
literally going into the pit of hell

3263.359 --> 3268.16
to spread the love of christ well that's

3265.92 --> 3270.4
a complete waste of time

3268.16 --> 3271.7599999999998
and why is he even doing it just

3270.4 --> 3273.839
delusional

3271.76 --> 3275.6800000000003
like nobody's gonna really accept it

3273.839 --> 3276.48
they're just gonna try to fool him into

3275.68 --> 3278.8799999999997
believing

3276.48 --> 3280.16
[ __ ] that he wants to believe while they

3278.88 --> 3282.88
drag him further

3280.16 --> 3284.72
into hell that's really what's gonna

3282.88 --> 3286.48
happen i tried to warn him about it and

3284.72 --> 3288.8799999999997
he didn't listen now he got obsessed

3286.48 --> 3291.04
with his little christ complex

3288.88 --> 3292.559
like oh he has this dude this special

3291.04 --> 3296.4
mission for god

3292.559 --> 3300.2400000000002
blah blah if you have nothing to hide

3296.4 --> 3300.2400000000002
you have nothing to worry about

3301.359 --> 3307.839
[ __ ] [ __ ]

3308.96 --> 3314.7200000000003
so yeah dude he's going places where i'm

3313.119 --> 3316.079
not gonna follow him and i'm not gonna

3314.72 --> 3320.0
pull him out

3316.079 --> 3322.1600000000003
dude i warned him he chose poorly

3320.0 --> 3335.839
now i could go [ __ ] himself it's as

3322.16 --> 3335.839
simple as that

3338.66 --> 3343.1189999999997
[Music]

3340.799 --> 3344.64
yeah there's definitely no point asking

3343.119 --> 3348.0
stone monkey 3d

3344.64 --> 3350.4
definitely besides if you

3348.0 --> 3351.04
actually ask for a wrench i'm gonna ban

3350.4 --> 3354.88
you

3351.04 --> 3357.44
it's in the rules it's right there

3354.88 --> 3363.839
it's right there in the rules never ask

3357.44 --> 3363.839
for a wrench

3364.079 --> 3367.28
unless it's like hey i need to post this

3366.88 --> 3369.359
link

3367.28 --> 3371.28
i can't post it without a wrench can i

3369.359 --> 3373.359
temporarily get a wrench

3371.28 --> 3375.28
i might actually give you temporarily a

3373.359 --> 3376.48
wrench if i sort of trust you're not

3375.28 --> 3378.88
gonna screw up my chat

3376.48 --> 3380.2400000000002
instantly with it and then i'm probably

3378.88 --> 3382.7200000000003
gonna take the wrench away i've done

3380.24 --> 3385.359
this a couple of times before

3382.72 --> 3387.2
right but i'm not gonna just give you a

3385.359 --> 3391.839
wrench especially after all that

3387.2 --> 3391.839
nonsense you put in my chat

3397.48 --> 3400.659
[Music]

3407.68 --> 3411.68
i don't know earth passenger if he did

3409.44 --> 3411.68
that

3411.839 --> 3415.44
he certainly said that he did and the

3414.4 --> 3417.44
fact that he had

3415.44 --> 3420.4
actually recorded our private

3417.44 --> 3423.92
conversations without telling me

3420.4 --> 3427.6800000000003
is downright criminal that's beyond

3423.92 --> 3429.359
moral yeah rejectable actions it's just

3427.68 --> 3433.1189999999997
downright criminal

3429.359 --> 3434.48
it really is it really is criminal that

3433.119 --> 3437.28
he did that

3434.48 --> 3439.28
he's unforgivable like i don't care what

3437.28 --> 3442.6400000000003
his motivations are

3439.28 --> 3445.2000000000003
it's just that he just recorded it and

3442.64 --> 3446.24
didn't even tell me when i thought we

3445.2 --> 3449.1189999999997
were friends

3446.24 --> 3450.24
no he was basically an infiltrator

3449.119 --> 3452.319
spying on me

3450.24 --> 3455.359
whatever justifies that it's just

3452.319 --> 3458.16
criminal and he betrayed our friendship

3455.359 --> 3460.16
it's never gonna be all right ever can

3458.16 --> 3460.96
[ __ ] drop debt for all i care at this

3460.16 --> 3463.44
point

3460.96 --> 3464.48
because he's a scumbag good servant is a

3463.44 --> 3467.68
treacherous

3464.48 --> 3470.48
scumbag that makes you

3467.68 --> 3471.2799999999997
believe you're friends with him and then

3470.48 --> 3474.88
secretly

3471.28 --> 3479.2000000000003
record you without telling you to then

3474.88 --> 3482.7200000000003
just try to persecute you with that

3479.2 --> 3485.839
only vicious psychopathic

3482.72 --> 3489.04
scumbags do that which is what he is

3485.839 --> 3490.24
and he can go [ __ ] himself you can go to

3489.04 --> 3492.5589999999997
the pits of hell

3490.24 --> 3493.7599999999998
and freaking never come out again for a

3492.559 --> 3502.94
lie cared buddy

3493.76 --> 3505.9990000000003
you're a scumbag

3502.94 --> 3505.9990000000003
[Music]

3509.52 --> 3517.119
and i feel really embarrassed forever

3512.64 --> 3519.68
ever having trusted him

3517.119 --> 3520.7200000000003
but yeah what drove me was the idea like

3519.68 --> 3523.68
wow

3520.72 --> 3525.1189999999997
this guy really wants to do good guess

3523.68 --> 3527.359
who showed me right

3525.119 --> 3529.52
guess who showed me yeah really wants to

3527.359 --> 3531.839
do good just break all moral

3529.52 --> 3534.24
decency to do it yeah yeah that's not

3531.839 --> 3537.7599999999998
how doing good works

3534.24 --> 3538.5589999999997
right lying viciously it's not how you

3537.76 --> 3540.96
do good

3538.559 --> 3542.0
just goes to show that me and my naivety

3540.96 --> 3544.4
about people just

3542.0 --> 3546.24
saying that they're wanting to do good

3544.4 --> 3548.559
and they're scumbags and they have

3546.24 --> 3550.319
like morally deranged actions which he

3548.559 --> 3550.88
showed already and i tried to correct

3550.319 --> 3554.64
him

3550.88 --> 3558.88
well guess what he was just lying

3554.64 --> 3562.319
all the time he's just a vicious

3558.88 --> 3564.4
liar and a scumbag

3562.319 --> 3566.72
i never want to associate with him ever

3564.4 --> 3566.7200000000003
again

3569.2 --> 3574.5589999999997
right yeah roger no i am embarrassed

3572.4 --> 3575.52
and i should be embarrassed because i

3574.559 --> 3578.559
let

3575.52 --> 3579.359
my guard down because i thought somebody

3578.559 --> 3581.28
could be better

3579.359 --> 3582.4
i'm never gonna do that again if

3581.28 --> 3585.92
somebody's not just

3582.4 --> 3587.52
outright 100 trustworthy through spirit

3585.92 --> 3589.839
through every action they do

3587.52 --> 3591.7599999999998
i'm not gonna share their my my inner

3589.839 --> 3594.799
personal workings with them anymore

3591.76 --> 3596.96
ever i'm just i'm done with

3594.799 --> 3599.2
trying to trust new people i'm done with

3596.96 --> 3603.68
it only the truly worthy

3599.2 --> 3605.839
can see my inner conflicts and feelings

3603.68 --> 3607.2
and the rest i will just only show them

3605.839 --> 3609.44
my strength

3607.2 --> 3610.319
because that yeah that can't do anything

3609.44 --> 3613.52
for them

3610.319 --> 3618.72
they secretly are trying to sabotage me

3613.52 --> 3618.72
like some infiltrator scumbag right

3620.319 --> 3627.04
which is what good servant is he's

3623.44 --> 3627.599
yeah an infiltrator scumbag who secretly

3627.04 --> 3630.16
records

3627.599 --> 3631.28
conversations without telling you to try

3630.16 --> 3633.839
and

3631.28 --> 3635.0400000000004
yeah try and take you down that's what

3633.839 --> 3638.24
absolute

3635.04 --> 3641.7599999999998
garbage scumbags do there's

3638.24 --> 3645.2799999999997
no excuse for it what so

3641.76 --> 3645.5200000000004
ever yeah i haven't really even hinted

3645.28 --> 3648.7200000000003
at

3645.52 --> 3651.2
any kind of criminal danger

3648.72 --> 3652.5589999999997
that i've been concealing or anything

3651.2 --> 3655.04
nothing i've

3652.559 --> 3656.1600000000003
the real thing that i shared with him is

3655.04 --> 3659.2799999999997
the fears

3656.16 --> 3661.04
of my own delusion because yeah i had

3659.28 --> 3663.28
dark world visions i've even talked

3661.04 --> 3667.04
about this now

3663.28 --> 3667.76
more recently that yeah in my dark world

3667.04 --> 3669.92
visions

3667.76 --> 3672.559
things were shown to me that aren't real

3669.92 --> 3674.2400000000002
but they were very convincing to me

3672.559 --> 3676.6400000000003
and have witnessed like really

3674.24 --> 3680.0789999999997
disgusting torturous things

3676.64 --> 3682.24
that were so so hurtful

3680.079 --> 3685.28
to experience and it was kind of

3682.24 --> 3687.68
suggested like i was the cause of that

3685.28 --> 3689.3590000000004
and i could never properly let that go

3687.68 --> 3692.0
and that haunted me

3689.359 --> 3692.72
it really haunted me i shared some of

3692.0 --> 3696.319
that

3692.72 --> 3699.5989999999997
with good servant and now

3696.319 --> 3700.88
now he's betrayed me so what are you

3699.599 --> 3703.839
gonna do

3700.88 --> 3705.28
what you can't prove that anything i

3703.839 --> 3708.319
said to you is real

3705.28 --> 3710.0
and i even said it to you like yeah

3708.319 --> 3712.079
it could i don't think it's real

3710.0 --> 3714.0
everybody tells me it's not real i have

3712.079 --> 3716.559
no physical proof that any of that

3714.0 --> 3717.359
what i've seen is real it's probably the

3716.559 --> 3719.92
demons

3717.359 --> 3722.24
trying to torture me because i'm such a

3719.92 --> 3723.599
big problem for them

3722.24 --> 3726.0
right right so i already already

3723.599 --> 3728.2400000000002
confessed everything like that

3726.0 --> 3730.16
it's just not something that i would

3728.24 --> 3732.4799999999996
just start talking about in the open

3730.16 --> 3735.1189999999997
because it's very close it's very creepy

3732.48 --> 3736.0
you don't do that you don't do that you

3735.119 --> 3738.799
don't talk about

3736.0 --> 3739.599
such personal things out in the open you

3738.799 --> 3741.44
leave that for

3739.599 --> 3743.3590000000004
people you trust people you think you're

3741.44 --> 3746.0
your friends that can handle it

3743.359 --> 3747.68

3747.68 --> 3750.8799999999997
that very personal [ __ ] about me in

3750.16 --> 3754.0
secret

3750.88 --> 3756.88
like a [ __ ] criminal scumbag and he's

3754.0 --> 3757.44
handed it over to some [ __ ] squirt boy

3756.88 --> 3760.48
wannabe

3757.44 --> 3761.76
inquisitor apparently or he hasn't maybe

3760.48 --> 3764.079
still considering it

3761.76 --> 3764.7990000000004
just that he is considerate makes you a

3764.079 --> 3767.76
[ __ ]

3764.799 --> 3769.119
psychopath good servant it makes you an

3767.76 --> 3773.76
irredeemable

that can i have not

3848.799 --> 3854.319
done anything wrong i am the probably

3852.0 --> 3856.079
the most open and honest person on the

3854.319 --> 3856.88
freaking internet you've ever come

3856.079 --> 3859.92
across

3856.88 --> 3860.88
there is nothing you can do to take me

3859.92 --> 3862.96
down

3860.88 --> 3864.7200000000003
if there would have been i would have

3862.96 --> 3868.16
already been taken down

3864.72 --> 3869.359
i'm still here i'm still here you can't

3868.16 --> 3871.839
[ __ ] stop me

3871.839 --> 3877.7599999999998
yourself

3872.96 --> 3881.039
yeah yeah you think you can take me down

3877.76 --> 3895.8390000000004
come at me bro come at me just gonna

3881.039 --> 3895.8390000000004
squirt yourself

3906.839 --> 3909.839
hmm

3911.76 --> 3917.8390000000004
did you much the movie us

3914.799 --> 3920.64
no i did not i did by the way finish uh

3917.839 --> 3921.44
watching excalibur i did finish watching

3920.64 --> 3924.319
that

3921.44 --> 3925.76
i almost forgot to make a note of that

3924.319 --> 3928.799
but yeah

3925.76 --> 3931.44
really freaking impressive movie

3928.799 --> 3934.079
it's not perfect though but it's really

3931.44 --> 3934.079
impressive

3935.2 --> 3939.9199999999996
definitely one of the best movies i've

3937.44 --> 3939.92
ever seen

3940.0 --> 3947.68
and very beautiful very beautiful movie

3943.2 --> 3947.68
very convincing very raw i loved it

3948.319 --> 3952.319
hey samson good to see you in chat

3952.559 --> 3959.52
how are you doing we chat in

3956.24 --> 3960.319
over skype sometime but yeah samson's

3959.52 --> 3962.4
just

3960.319 --> 3964.5589999999997
a bit under pressure of the all this

3962.4 --> 3967.039
craziness going down

3964.559 --> 3967.039
i think

3972.079 --> 3977.8390000000004
yeah mark collard i know i know right

3975.52 --> 3980.319
i know that's why i said it it's

3977.839 --> 3980.319
criminal

3981.2 --> 3985.4399999999996
yeah it's criminal to record somebody

3983.839 --> 3987.2
and not tell them

3985.44 --> 3988.48
potentially i don't know it depends on

3987.2 --> 3991.7599999999998
the country maybe

3988.48 --> 3993.599
but it's like

3991.76 --> 3995.3590000000004
it is still criminal whether it's

3993.599 --> 3998.1600000000003
against the law or not it's still a

3995.359 --> 4002.24
criminal thing to do

3998.16 --> 4004.72
unless like you have high suspicion

4002.24 --> 4006.0
like this person is actually a criminal

4004.72 --> 4008.16
and i'm trying to pry

4006.0 --> 4010.079
confession about his crime out of him

4008.16 --> 4012.24
right there is potentially an excuse for

4010.079 --> 4015.599
that if you really have a good lead

4012.24 --> 4017.7599999999998
good servant did not he just abused my

4015.599 --> 4020.96
trust

4017.76 --> 4022.3190000000004
to a very disgusting level that's it

4020.96 --> 4024.88
because i would have probably if he

4022.319 --> 4026.72
would have wanted me to go deeper like

4024.88 --> 4027.2000000000003
if he said i am worried about this and

4026.72 --> 4029.5989999999997
that

4027.2 --> 4031.1189999999997
he have actually said that sometime i

4029.599 --> 4033.76
would have just explained it i

4031.119 --> 4036.7200000000003
have explained i've explained my visions

4033.76 --> 4040.7990000000004
i have explained the delusions even

4036.72 --> 4040.799
that plagued me before

4041.52 --> 4045.2
so don't call me aswin but i will check

4044.0 --> 4049.839
my paypal

4045.2 --> 4049.839
don't do that tiny womble it's not funny

4050.559 --> 4053.92
right anyway i've almost forgot i shared

4052.799 --> 4056.96

4116.839 --> 4119.839

yes

4124.239 --> 4129.12

thank you very much huh

4169.52 --> 4176.799000000001
yes pilton pop the gravy reset

4173.12 --> 4180.239
well the supposed great reset happens

4176.799 --> 4181.359
the people that are like not a part of

4180.239 --> 4184.4
the new world order

4181.359 --> 4184.719
they if they realize it and choose to do

4184.4 --> 4189.759
so

4184.719 --> 4193.52
they can be part of the gravy reset

4189.759 --> 4193.52
which is a strengthened

4194.64 --> 4202.0
the independent from the darkness

4198.32 --> 4205.12
yeah just a decent it's the gravy reset

4202.0 --> 4209.199
it's you figure it out what it is it's

4205.12 --> 4211.679
it's it's a mystical word for the future

4209.199 --> 4213.199
for the independent people who are

4211.679 --> 4216.88
actually rediscovering

4213.199 --> 4220.159
logos from scratch

4216.88 --> 4220.159000000001
yeah the gravy reset

4223.76 --> 4231.84
yeah michael jones isn't he pretty cool

4226.32 --> 4231.84
isn't it

4233.99 --> 4237.188999999999
[Music]

4240.0 --> 4243.6
right roger i've yeah i've heard of that

4242.88 --> 4246.96
it's

4243.6 --> 4249.280000000001
you know the thing is though

4246.96 --> 4250.2390000000005
i'm not entirely sure of this yet the

4249.28 --> 4252.88
shop owner

4250.239 --> 4255.12
would have to double check this himself

4252.88 --> 4258.32
but this supposed fine

4255.12 --> 4261.199
i think that a shop owner can simply

4258.32 --> 4261.199
reject that

4262.4 --> 4266.08
because it's unconstitutional it's like

4264.64 --> 4268.159000000001
oh that's a really

4266.08 --> 4269.36
interesting policy that you're trying to

4268.159 --> 4273.08
put on me but i don't

4269.36 --> 4274.48
actually have to pay that because it's

4273.08 --> 4279.04
unconstitutional

4274.48 --> 4282.639999999999
you cannot legally make me do that

4279.04 --> 4282.64
because it's not part of law

4283.76 --> 4288.08
it might be pretended like it is but the

4287.12 --> 4290.8
entire thing

4288.08 --> 4292.159
is unconstitutional and cannot really be

4290.8 --> 4295.679
done

4292.159 --> 4298.5599999999995
not legally so i believe

4295.679 --> 4300.0
and it's very good if yeah actual shop

4298.56 --> 4301.84
owners that would be willing to try

4300.0 --> 4303.28
it out if they double check it with

4301.84 --> 4307.12
their lawyers very careful

4303.28 --> 4308.48
carefully that you can just say no

4307.12 --> 4310.5599999999995
it's very nice that you're sending me

4308.48 --> 4314.0
this file we're just not gonna pay it

4310.56 --> 4316.56
just put it on indefinitely like oh 460

4314.0 --> 4317.76
euros make it a million make it a

4316.56 --> 4320.4800000000005
[ __ ] million

4317.76 --> 4321.12
just not gonna pay it and then at some

4320.48 --> 4323.759999999999
point

4321.12 --> 4326.8
and this whole shit's gonna go down then

4323.76 --> 4331.04
yeah that bill's just gonna be scrapped

4326.8 --> 4335.52
that's what i suspect could be possible

4331.04 --> 4337.5199999999995
but again it would need to be checked

4335.52 --> 4338.8
so i'm not just saying oh store owners

4337.52 --> 4340.64
you do this no no

4338.8 --> 4342.320000000001
definitely check it out with your

4340.64 --> 4344.88
lawyers okay

4342.32 --> 4347.04
but i suspect that it's possible that

4344.88 --> 4350.2390000000005
you could just ignore the fines

4347.04 --> 4352.0
because it's not legal actually but

4350.239 --> 4353.919999999999
again double check that with your

4352.0 --> 4356.96
lawyers before you try something out

4353.92 --> 4358.56
like that

4356.96 --> 4360.64
you know the whole thing is a giant

4358.56 --> 4362.88
bluff so i wouldn't be surprised if it

4360.64 --> 4364.8
actually worked like that and you could

4362.88 --> 4366.159000000001
just say yeah sure that's really nice

4364.8 --> 4368.320000000001
yeah yeah bills oh

4366.159 --> 4370.32
oh all the fines oh you're criminal

4368.32 --> 4371.36
you're fine for the corona it's really

4370.32 --> 4374.239
nice just

4371.36 --> 4376.4
shove it in the corner and ignore it and

4374.239 --> 4378.0
then they might send a reminder a little

4376.4 --> 4379.599999999999
higher fight yeah it's really nice

4378.0 --> 4382.64
you're just not gonna pay it

4379.6 --> 4385.84
just not gonna pay it now again

4382.64 --> 4387.280000000001
double check with your lawyers if that

4385.84 --> 4390.96
is actually

4387.28 --> 4394.4
a legal route you could take with it

4390.96 --> 4395.36
don't just engage it check it out

4394.4 --> 4398.32
thoroughly

4395.36 --> 4400.719
how that works legally with your lawyers

4398.32 --> 4400.719
all right

4405.6 --> 4409.120000000001
right because it would be pretty

4406.8 --> 4410.96
hilarious if just suddenly all store

4409.12 --> 4412.0
owners would just start ignoring it and

4410.96 --> 4415.36
then they all get

4412.0 --> 4418.56
fined and oh look there's like a hundred

4415.36 --> 4420.5599999999995
million in fines around the country

4418.56 --> 4421.679
a hundred because it's a small country

4420.56 --> 4423.4400000000005
here right

4421.679 --> 4425.36
and everybody's getting these fines and

4423.44 --> 4428.96
like nobody's paying it so like

4425.36 --> 4431.36
oh yeah the state owes we need

4428.96 --> 4432.2390000000005
to reinforce people paying that money

4431.36 --> 4435.199
what are they gonna do

4432.239 --> 4437.12
send cops around and literally try to

4435.199 --> 4441.199
shake down stores

4437.12 --> 4443.679
to pay the fine is that gonna happen

4441.199 --> 4444.799999999999
that's gonna set a grim tone if they do

4443.679 --> 4448.64
that

4444.8 --> 4452.719
then it's just like oh oh wow

4448.64 --> 4455.92
the government are literally thugs now

4452.719 --> 4458.2390000000005
they're gonna just shake you down who

4455.92 --> 4458.2390000000005
knows

4458.4 --> 4462.32
but anyway double check with your

4460.8 --> 4464.88
lawyers if you're going to

4462.32 --> 4465.44
basically take on the fines and ignore

4464.88 --> 4468.64
them

4465.44 --> 4470.799999999999
don't just do it because the sake of it

4468.64 --> 4472.2390000000005
double check with your lawyers how this

4470.8 --> 4475.04
works

4472.239 --> 4476.08
i might be wrong see it's just a

4475.04 --> 4478.64
suspicion

4476.08 --> 4480.5599999999995
anyway i'm gonna round out the show so

4478.64 --> 4482.159000000001
thanks everyone for coming

4480.56 --> 4483.76
i hope you like this show i thought it

4482.159 --> 4484.159
was pretty good even though it was a

4483.76 --> 4487.04
little

4484.159 --> 4488.48
short because i started up so late

4487.04 --> 4490.64
because i overslept

4488.48 --> 4492.48
because it was a late night very very

4490.64 --> 4493.92
late night and at some point my body is

4492.48 --> 4495.919999999999
just gonna say yes screw it

4493.92 --> 4497.4400000000005
we need to sleep so i'm just like oh oh

4495.92 --> 4498.719
you had to get up then well that's too
