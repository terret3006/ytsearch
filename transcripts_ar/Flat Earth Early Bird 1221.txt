time there's also a lot of wind

121.36 --> 124.64
so

122.079 --> 128.16
yeah when it's really windy sometimes

124.64 --> 130.399
the trails just dissipate completely

128.16 --> 132.319
even if they're sprayed in the morning

130.399 --> 135.92
but yeah there's some fluffy clouds up

132.319 --> 138.23899999999998

299.199 --> 303.84000000000003
made by jim bob had a great stream that

301.36 --> 303.84000000000003
was fun

307.759 --> 311.56
no brenda though

314.479 --> 319.28
but like yeah his crowd is already a bit

317.12 --> 324.199
divided some of them are like really

319.28 --> 324.19899999999996
sick of brenda which i totally get

328.16 --> 335.56
hey jeff gassett

330.88 --> 335.56
wow so many people in already

349.039 --> 355.36
yeah i was watching owen benjamin

352.32 --> 357.199
episode 1378

355.36 --> 359.6
a lot about mind control and how it

357.199 --> 362.24
works

359.6 --> 362.24
great stuff

363.68 --> 367.56
very fractal thinking

390.8 --> 396.88
i love when brenda comes on my co-worker

393.199 --> 396.88
sees how crazy they both are

397.199 --> 401.28000000000003
for believing

398.8 --> 404.08
or believing the globe

401.28 --> 407.52
are your co-workers are still globers

404.08 --> 409.75899999999996
yeah then brenda is not going to be like

407.52 --> 412.71999999999997
oh yeah you're with her

409.759 --> 415.72
or him or whatever

412.72 --> 415.72
yeah

427.039 --> 429.919
ah

428.16 --> 431.759
yeah they are brendam

429.919 --> 435.79999999999995
did you watch it

431.759 --> 435.8
it was hilarious right

442.16 --> 446.639
yeah man and i

443.919 --> 447.68
i really want to call into jim bob

446.639 --> 449.199
one time

447.68 --> 451.28000000000003
it's just that

449.199 --> 454.0
usually when he starts his streams is

451.28 --> 454.0
like when i'm

455.36 --> 459.91900000000004
it's like gonna when i run out of juice

457.68 --> 463.039
when it comes to like live performance

459.919 --> 467.19899999999996
i'm still very chatty

463.039 --> 467.199
but also just goofballing around and

467.44 --> 470.4
so yeah

470.56 --> 476.24
it's the hazard of yeah of

473.28 --> 478.31899999999996
good streamers in america

476.24 --> 482.08
they usually all get going right when

478.319 --> 482.08000000000004
i'm kind of starting to wind down

482.639 --> 485.12
oh well

486.96 --> 492.4
i'll wait for a special moment when i'm

489.199 --> 494.319
just highly energetic and focused and

492.4 --> 496.31899999999996
then get on the stream and see what

494.319 --> 498.24
happens

496.319 --> 502.599
i'm pretty much already there in chat

498.24 --> 502.599
every day and he knows it

508.72 --> 513.44
ah good yeah you saw it both

510.96 --> 513.4399999999999
brandon

514.08 --> 520.08
yeah the second time was like even

516.159 --> 522.479
crazier than the first time really

520.08 --> 523.76
i think that the first go brenda was

522.479 --> 527.36
just

523.76 --> 529.519
not prepared for somebody to actually

527.36 --> 532.399
basically

529.519 --> 534.72
allow her to go that nutty

532.399 --> 537.04
and then still

534.72 --> 539.6800000000001
get a conversation i think she's not

537.04 --> 539.68
used to that

540.88 --> 545.2
and then the second time she was kind of

542.959 --> 548.3199999999999
counting on it so she could show

545.2 --> 550.8000000000001
everybody like how true truly how nuts

548.32 --> 550.8000000000001
she is

556.16 --> 560.76
hey flatter sage good to see you

573.279 --> 577.36
right but yeah for me

575.2 --> 579.0400000000001
i i really like that he's dealing with

577.36 --> 580.64
brenda

579.04 --> 582.88
because yeah i've been dealing with

580.64 --> 586.56
brenda quite a few

582.88 --> 587.4399999999999
right in the last in the past years

586.56 --> 590.56
i mean

587.44 --> 592.8800000000001
not so much anymore now but back then

590.56 --> 594.88
they were constantly trying to approach

592.88 --> 596.88
me brenda was always trying to get in my

594.88 --> 597.6
chat

596.88 --> 599.92
but

597.6 --> 603.12
yeah every time i let her in now she

599.92 --> 604.8
just she's just so militant marxist and

603.12 --> 607.2
all that

604.8 --> 609.279
it's just i can't bear it like there's

607.2 --> 610.6400000000001
no proper conversation coming out of

609.279 --> 615.0
that she's just

610.64 --> 615.0
trying to psychologically attack

621.519 --> 625.5600000000001
what the hell where's boy

633.12 --> 635.68
accepted

636.88 --> 641.4399999999999
borders boy i don't know what you've

638.64 --> 643.8389999999999
been watching but

641.44 --> 646.48
take it easy

643.839 --> 648.399
you gotta realize there's like

646.48 --> 652.24
through the meat industry there's a lot

648.399 --> 654.32
of extra stuff leftovers

652.24 --> 656.9590000000001
carcass leftovers

654.32 --> 658.48
i mean i'm all for just trying to use

656.959 --> 660.3199999999999
anything

658.48 --> 661.9200000000001
right because what do you what else are

660.32 --> 664.32
you going to do with it

661.92 --> 666.88
so i don't think that they specifically

664.32 --> 668.0
like kill animals just to make fabric

666.88 --> 669.519
softeners

668.0 --> 671.04
right

669.519 --> 672.72
but yeah maybe

671.04 --> 675.68
some of those

672.72 --> 678.0
things out there have some

675.68 --> 680.16
animal component to them

678.0 --> 682.64
doesn't necessarily have to be a giant

680.16 --> 683.92
nightmare

682.64 --> 686.56
so i don't know what you've been

683.92 --> 686.56
watching but

687.36 --> 690.64
i wouldn't be too worried

694.56 --> 698.56
truly demonic no it's not

696.959 --> 700.64
no it's not

698.56 --> 703.3599999999999
dude

700.64 --> 704.399
animal fat is being used for all kinds

703.36 --> 706.0
of things

704.399 --> 709.36
it used to be

706.0 --> 711.76
standard use for soap

709.36 --> 713.76
okay lychee

711.76 --> 716.24
it's not

713.76 --> 718.0
monstrous like unless you're like if

716.24 --> 719.44
like

718.0 --> 721.68
a vegan

719.44 --> 724.48
that things like animals are holy and we

721.68 --> 727.4799999999999
should never ever hurt any

724.48 --> 727.48
right

730.8 --> 734.7199999999999
i'm sorry i don't see it borders boy

735.76 --> 741.92
they don't just like oh we need animal

739.2 --> 745.839
fat kill those animals and let's render

741.92 --> 745.8389999999999
them down that's not how that works

750.079 --> 754.3199999999999
yes fat coats fabric softener yeah it

752.0 --> 755.519
makes it feel really soft yeah

754.32 --> 758.24
that's right

755.519 --> 760.8
they don't specifically kill animals to

758.24 --> 761.839
get to get it right

760.8 --> 763.8389999999999
it's

761.839 --> 767.12
leftovers

763.839 --> 767.12
i don't see a problem

768.72 --> 774.72
i mean that they use fat is like one of

771.2 --> 776.24
the least of the problems of like

774.72 --> 779.76
what do you call like

776.24 --> 781.519
washing yeah cloth washing industrial

779.76 --> 783.519
stuff

781.519 --> 787.8
usually certain other chemical

783.519 --> 787.8
components are much more problematic

791.6 --> 797.9590000000001
right we're wearing leather shoes not

793.76 --> 797.959
wasting any parts that's right

823.76 --> 829.8
using fabric okay fine i don't use

826.399 --> 829.8
fabric softener

832.56 --> 839.2399999999999
but i mean i don't see that ooh it's so

834.72 --> 839.24
evil i don't see that sorry

854.04 --> 857.1999999999999
[Music]

861.95 --> 865.139
[Music]

866.959 --> 871.6389999999999
hey he's singing star wars good to see

868.639 --> 871.639
you

872.72 --> 876.88
yeah oh and brent m

874.48 --> 876.88
indeed

877.36 --> 882.0790000000001
right yeah jim bob well brenda did go

880.079 --> 884.3199999999999
for like sort of name calling in like

882.079 --> 887.519
that first show eventually she got all

884.32 --> 890.1600000000001
like super slanderous towards jesus

887.519 --> 891.36
saying horrible things about him

890.16 --> 893.92
right

891.36 --> 895.6800000000001
but yeah jimbo seems like completely

893.92 --> 900.56
unfazed

895.68 --> 900.56
which is really amazing to behold

904.639 --> 909.6800000000001
that's not entirely true he is fazed by

907.04 --> 912.079
it but he doesn't really do anything

909.68 --> 913.92
like with the emotional responses that

912.079 --> 917.959
he does

913.92 --> 917.959
visibly display

940.0 --> 943.68
you don't eat animals either okay

942.079 --> 945.279
borders boy i didn't know that about you

943.68 --> 948.8
that's weird

945.279 --> 948.8
i didn't expect that really

952.88 --> 956.8
fine but yeah i get it if you're like oh

956.0 --> 959.04
i'm

956.8 --> 960.639
full vegan

959.04 --> 962.639
if you're gonna go full vegan or

960.639 --> 965.6800000000001
something then

962.639 --> 967.6
or i guess vegetarian

965.68 --> 970.3199999999999
maybe you do eat eggs

967.6 --> 972.9590000000001
and dairy and all that i don't know

970.32 --> 975.6
but yeah i get it like if you make that

972.959 --> 978.279
effort then just taking notice that yeah

975.6 --> 980.9590000000001
a lot of animal products are actually

978.279 --> 983.12
industrially used and all kinds of

980.959 --> 985.04
consumer products that's right

983.12 --> 986.16
and that might gross you out i totally

985.04 --> 989.5999999999999
get it

986.16 --> 989.6
from that perspective right

991.04 --> 997.92
but yeah it's inevitable

993.36 --> 1000.0
i mean you can technically avoid it

997.92 --> 1002.959
but it's always gonna be out there you

1000.0 --> 1002.959
gotta realize that

1004.32 --> 1007.6700000000001
me personally i'm much more worried

1006.24 --> 1009.04
about just chemicals

1007.67 --> 1011.5999999999999
[Music]

1009.04 --> 1014.639
like

1011.6 --> 1016.88
oil based perfumes and all that sort of

1014.639 --> 1016.88
[ __ ]

1017.12 --> 1023.12
i mean that is like has a measurable

1020.24 --> 1026.559
detriment to my health even if it's just

1023.12 --> 1028.799
somebody using it in my vicinity

1026.559 --> 1028.799
right

1032.079 --> 1036.24
i'm not so much worried about animal

1034.16 --> 1039.8390000000002
products

1036.24 --> 1039.839
grosses you out all right

1043.679 --> 1048.96
all right well if you want to avoid

1047.199 --> 1052.0
bad things

1048.96 --> 1055.6000000000001
then minimalism is usually the answer

1052.0 --> 1055.6
just keep everything simple

1055.679 --> 1060.88
right you don't need all the high-tech

1057.679 --> 1060.88
fancy [ __ ] really

1062.0 --> 1067.2
and that's the the fancy stuff

1065.12 --> 1069.9189999999999
oh we're so modern we're so advanced

1067.2 --> 1071.3600000000001
that's usually where they typically hide

1069.919 --> 1073.44
those kind of things there's that's

1071.36 --> 1075.039
where they hide the poisons

1073.44 --> 1076.48
that's where they

1075.039 --> 1077.6
insert

1076.48 --> 1080.08
like

1077.6 --> 1083.6789999999999
recycled stuff and all that animal

1080.08 --> 1085.52
products so yeah that's how it works

1083.679 --> 1086.799
live minimalist right all right all

1085.52 --> 1089.12
right

1086.799 --> 1089.12
okay

1091.2 --> 1095.4
luxuries make you weak yeah

1096.6 --> 1100.48
[Music]

1098.799 --> 1105.039
it's like if they don't physically make

1100.48 --> 1105.039
you weak they make you mentally weak

1105.76 --> 1110.559
it just aggravates your comfort zone

1108.88 --> 1111.6000000000001
makes it bigger

1110.559 --> 1114.24
and more

1111.6 --> 1114.24
tenacious

1115.44 --> 1120.24
and yeah

1117.679 --> 1122.4
luxuries usually are like oh that makes

1120.24 --> 1124.799
something really so much easier you

1122.4 --> 1127.52
don't need to do anything for it anymore

1124.799 --> 1128.799
well not doing anything anymore for

1127.52 --> 1131.28
anything

1128.799 --> 1132.48
usually causes you to basically slow

1131.28 --> 1134.559
down

1132.48 --> 1136.4
start kind of getting dumb because you

1134.559 --> 1138.799
can you don't have to do anything

1136.4 --> 1138.799
anymore

1140.24 --> 1143.919
no you were never blocked troll

1147.52 --> 1151.24
derp alert indeed

1162.64 --> 1167.5200000000002
mainly because i don't have money

1165.2 --> 1167.52
okay

1170.48 --> 1174.24
well

1171.52 --> 1177.72
luxuries also make you weak even if you

1174.24 --> 1177.72
do have money

1197.039 --> 1203.039
oh by the way check this out

1199.52 --> 1206.559
yeah just a little side video

1203.039 --> 1209.679
neil dug up on youtube

1206.559 --> 1209.6789999999999
this is really cute

1211.28 --> 1215.8799999999999
it's a short video just check it out

1220.01 --> 1223.16
[Music]

1224.88 --> 1229.2
to be honest i like not having money it

1227.2 --> 1231.3600000000001
makes me see things for what they really

1229.2 --> 1231.3600000000001
are

1231.52 --> 1237.679
yeah borders boy yeah me too there is an

1234.64 --> 1237.679
advantage to it

1241.2 --> 1246.799
one of your minions no no no i

1244.32 --> 1249.84
i timed you out and now rick beck is

1246.799 --> 1249.84
timing you out

1252.48 --> 1258.24
for some reason

1255.12 --> 1260.8799999999999
you can't watch it without leaving here

1258.24 --> 1262.64
okay well it's only like

1260.88 --> 1264.72
half a minute or something

1262.64 --> 1270.1200000000001
just click it and then just

1264.72 --> 1270.1200000000001
back page it after that right back

1279.039 --> 1284.64
if you had money you don't think you

1280.48 --> 1284.64
would be particularly nice person yeah

1286.48 --> 1293.6
well i had a bit of money in the past

1289.679 --> 1296.0
basically from my mother's inheritance

1293.6 --> 1298.0
uh yeah

1296.0 --> 1301.0
i didn't really like what it did to me

1298.0 --> 1301.0
either

1304.64 --> 1309.679
and like in retrospect i really feel

1307.28 --> 1312.24
that like

1309.679 --> 1313.8400000000001
i wish i hadn't been like so corrupted

1312.24 --> 1316.32
by the moment

1313.84 --> 1318.799
and then i used it basically to escape

1316.32 --> 1321.52
everything and yeah the misery of my

1318.799 --> 1324.08
mother being dead which was made a huge

1321.52 --> 1327.28
impact with me

1324.08 --> 1330.24
a very visceral level

1327.28 --> 1333.84
also because of the way it all went

1330.24 --> 1333.84
what all preceded it

1334.4 --> 1341.1200000000001
but yeah retrospect man i could have

1336.32 --> 1341.12
just used that money so much more wisely

1342.32 --> 1346.52
but yeah i was just too distracted

1346.799 --> 1350.799
i never really got like

1349.52 --> 1352.1589999999999
dark with it

1350.799 --> 1354.4
but i

1352.159 --> 1354.4
yeah

1357.2 --> 1364.32
like i was dwelling among like

1360.48 --> 1365.52
just like power hungry fantasizing more

1364.32 --> 1368.0
and that's

1365.52 --> 1372.039
like yeah it's just no good it's not

1368.0 --> 1372.039
very healthy for you either

1374.88 --> 1378.48
holy crap that was awesome yeah i told

1376.64 --> 1381.039
you it was worth it

1378.48 --> 1381.039
cool right

1383.039 --> 1389.12
but just the look in that deer's

1385.679 --> 1392.0800000000002
face like those eyes like

1389.12 --> 1394.8799999999999
it looks like so like yay

1392.08 --> 1394.8799999999999
so happy

1397.59 --> 1402.9099999999999
[Music]

1399.2 --> 1405.979
it was like all excited

1402.91 --> 1405.979
[Music]

1421.08 --> 1424.1499999999999
[Music]

1438.159 --> 1441.6000000000001
right but anyway look

1443.679 --> 1447.76
if you had money and

1445.84 --> 1450.24
you might have not been all that great

1447.76 --> 1452.0
with it like me in the past

1450.24 --> 1453.679
well

1452.0 --> 1456.4
there's still a way

1453.679 --> 1458.3200000000002
to kind of set it right

1456.4 --> 1460.48
almost to like prove to yourself that

1458.32 --> 1464.0
you can't handle it right

1460.48 --> 1464.0
it's just like the first test

1464.32 --> 1469.6
you could compare it to

1466.48 --> 1471.919
like the jump test in the matrix

1469.6 --> 1473.52
right when neo supposed to like jump

1471.919 --> 1474.88
across

1473.52 --> 1478.0
irise

1474.88 --> 1479.6000000000001
flat apartment buildings

1478.0 --> 1482.24
and everybody's like

1479.6 --> 1484.3999999999999
yeah of course he's gonna drop

1482.24 --> 1486.24
well that's kind of like what i

1484.4 --> 1488.5590000000002
experienced like in full anticipation

1486.24 --> 1490.0
like but he might make it yet but nobody

1488.559 --> 1491.279
makes it

1490.0 --> 1494.0
right

1491.279 --> 1496.559
well if you learn from it from how that

1494.0 --> 1498.64
happened what you faced when you were in

1496.559 --> 1500.799
that situation and you get honest about

1498.64 --> 1503.5200000000002
it you don't get hungry

1500.799 --> 1507.12
or the sensation back

1503.52 --> 1509.279
then you can anticipate and a potential

1507.12 --> 1510.8799999999999
future rise

1509.279 --> 1513.12
in wealth

1510.88 --> 1516.96
and then anticipate those effects so

1513.12 --> 1516.9599999999998
that you don't get carried away

1517.279 --> 1520.4
and do the same

1518.559 --> 1523.2
dumb [ __ ]

1520.4 --> 1523.2
whatever it was

1523.279 --> 1527.84
right so i'm pretty certain that at this

1525.6 --> 1530.8799999999999
point

1527.84 --> 1533.039
i've learned how to live with

1530.88 --> 1537.0390000000002
sort of poverty it's not even real

1533.039 --> 1539.84
poverty to be honest right to me i feel

1537.039 --> 1543.84
poor because everybody else around me

1539.84 --> 1547.1999999999998
always like seems to have money to spend

1543.84 --> 1549.1999999999998
on stuff on going places and just having

1547.2 --> 1551.6000000000001
parties or whatever

1549.2 --> 1554.0800000000002
i don't

1551.6 --> 1556.559
so in that sense for i learned from that

1554.08 --> 1559.6789999999999
and i learned from the time in the past

1556.559 --> 1561.6
when i did have like what is it 160 000

1559.679 --> 1564.5590000000002
euros or something

1561.6 --> 1567.279
i definitely learned from that now

1564.559 --> 1569.44
and even back then i wasn't all that bad

1567.279 --> 1573.2
with it i was very careful not to just

1569.44 --> 1573.2
spend it on dumb [ __ ]

1573.76 --> 1579.6
i used it to get a lot of research

1576.799 --> 1581.6
like in my mind done as to like what

1579.6 --> 1584.1589999999999
even is out there

1581.6 --> 1586.08
what can you face because normally when

1584.159 --> 1587.0390000000002
i was poor and now

1586.08 --> 1589.6
still

1587.039 --> 1592.0
i literally just close my eyes to all of

1589.6 --> 1594.0
it because i don't want to

1592.0 --> 1595.76
be reminded about things that are just

1594.0 --> 1597.84
way out of my reach

1595.76 --> 1600.1589999999999
don't want to start planning how to use

1597.84 --> 1602.48
things that i can never attain in the

1600.159 --> 1602.48
moment

1603.039 --> 1606.8799999999999
and then having that monthly so money

1605.36 --> 1609.84
suddenly did

1606.88 --> 1612.64
enable me to actually look what is out

1609.84 --> 1614.24
there at that level

1612.64 --> 1618.159
for a bit

1614.24 --> 1618.159
and then i got intimidated i just

1618.64 --> 1622.24
realized there's always somebody that's

1620.559 --> 1625.279
richer

1622.24 --> 1627.52
and they like to poke you

1625.279 --> 1627.52
uh

1628.29 --> 1631.4099999999999
[Music]

1636.559 --> 1641.2
what am i trying to hide well we're

1638.159 --> 1644.48
trying to hide you and your incessant

1641.2 --> 1647.039
whining bob noddell's gyroscope

1644.48 --> 1648.64
that's why

1647.039 --> 1651.36
are you trying to hide me because you're

1648.64 --> 1651.3600000000001
annoying

1653.36 --> 1658.6399999999999
you're you're not here to have a

1654.72 --> 1658.64
conversation you're just whining

1663.6 --> 1666.8799999999999
you could still change that

1667.52 --> 1672.859
if it is in you

1669.74 --> 1672.859
[Music]

1673.919 --> 1678.64
yeah it's good again learning from that

1675.36 --> 1680.0
experience well it's my holy duty

1678.64 --> 1682.0
to myself

1680.0 --> 1685.12
right the principles whatever is going

1682.0 --> 1687.679
to happen no matter what it is

1685.12 --> 1690.799
whether it is wanted or unwanted

1687.679 --> 1691.8400000000001
whatever i experience i have to learn

1690.799 --> 1694.96
from it

1691.84 --> 1694.9599999999998
like if i don't

1695.12 --> 1700.08
it feels like i would literally die on

1697.52 --> 1700.08
the spot

1701.36 --> 1706.24
there's a couple of times in my teens

1703.36 --> 1709.6
where i was like really like giving up

1706.24 --> 1711.84
on everything like depression

1709.6 --> 1711.84
that's

1712.64 --> 1716.0800000000002
like

1713.6 --> 1718.1589999999999
that kind of left the scars in the other

1716.08 --> 1721.4399999999998
dimension even

1718.159 --> 1721.44
it was that bad for me

1721.6 --> 1727.6
so like i just i force myself after that

1726.32 --> 1731.6789999999999
point like

1727.6 --> 1734.9599999999998
you can never be allowed

1731.679 --> 1737.2
to not learn from things ever again

1734.96 --> 1739.6000000000001
like no matter what it is no matter how

1737.2 --> 1741.279
crazy it gets no matter how torturous

1739.6 --> 1744.32
you will

1741.279 --> 1745.919
learn from it

1744.32 --> 1748.96
and when you get out of it you might

1745.919 --> 1751.3600000000001
have lost something but you will have

1748.96 --> 1754.24
gained something also

1751.36 --> 1754.24
and you must

1755.52 --> 1758.8799999999999
that's

1756.64 --> 1762.3600000000001
yeah it's kind of become my

1758.88 --> 1762.3600000000001
life's motto

1766.64 --> 1771.1200000000001
what am i whining about

1769.039 --> 1773.2
you're whining about getting timed out

1771.12 --> 1775.76
and that people are scared for you of

1773.2 --> 1779.039
you when you've not said anything that's

1775.76 --> 1780.48
scary in any sense you've not said

1779.039 --> 1783.76
anything

1780.48 --> 1787.1200000000001
that wasn't at least four years outdated

1783.76 --> 1789.76
bob nodell's gyroscope

1787.12 --> 1793.08
you said nothing that is the slightest

1789.76 --> 1793.08
bit intimidating

1809.44 --> 1811.919
so yeah

1812.159 --> 1814.88
you get a point

1815.52 --> 1820.6399999999999
and then yeah then we can talk

1818.559 --> 1823.44
but you gotta start by actually having a

1820.64 --> 1825.679
point and not just being here to wine

1823.44 --> 1825.679
okay

1832.72 --> 1837.48
javascripts and sections are scary

1838.88 --> 1843.5200000000002
well if you think the earth is a global

1840.96 --> 1843.52
kind of r

1844.559 --> 1847.9189999999999
of course

1845.6 --> 1850.8799999999999
any global has sufficient [ __ ]

1847.919 --> 1852.7990000000002
technobabble garbage to convince

1850.88 --> 1854.0800000000002
themselves and gaslight others in the

1852.799 --> 1855.36
process

1854.08 --> 1857.4399999999998
so they hope

1855.36 --> 1859.4399999999998
that they're not scared of it because

1857.44 --> 1861.8400000000001
everything works in the globe which it

1859.44 --> 1861.8400000000001
doesn't

1862.96 --> 1869.039
but yeah gyroscopes the sextants are not

1865.2 --> 1869.039
scary to flat earthers at all

1873.6 --> 1876.6399999999999
i don't know where you're going

1875.36 --> 1879.84
oh hey

1876.64 --> 1881.919
hey why don't you just stop whining

1879.84 --> 1884.48
you're whining about that now

1881.919 --> 1886.72
get a point

1884.48 --> 1888.96
get a point you get it

1886.72 --> 1891.919
a point

1888.96 --> 1894.0
bring something other than oh i'm not

1891.919 --> 1896.48
doing this i'm not doing that why are

1894.0 --> 1899.2
you doing this waiting like

1896.48 --> 1899.2
half a point

1904.559 --> 1911.6399999999999
right and hurry it up because if you

1907.2 --> 1911.64
keep this up i will ban you

1922.0 --> 1927.76
yeah earth's flat

1924.159 --> 1930.88
it's very flat geometric orientation

1927.76 --> 1933.84
the earth's surface is flat

1930.88 --> 1936.7990000000002
it's a flat plane

1933.84 --> 1939.12
i know flat is not a shape

1936.799 --> 1941.12
and oh there is mountains and all that

1939.12 --> 1943.6789999999999
yeah that's why it's the geometric

1941.12 --> 1945.84
orientation of the surface it's flat

1943.679 --> 1947.279
earth is flat

1945.84 --> 1949.76
right

1947.279 --> 1952.48
all these tools exploration tools

1949.76 --> 1954.48
sextants

1952.48 --> 1955.44
like that they only work because it's

1954.48 --> 1958.64
flat

1955.44 --> 1958.64
the globe model

1958.72 --> 1965.6000000000001
is based off a flat plane

1962.559 --> 1968.32
and then warped into a globe

1965.6 --> 1968.32
all of it is

1973.36 --> 1980.4799999999998
gyroscopes mechanical ones are rigid

1977.6 --> 1982.6399999999999
you spin them up you don't move around

1980.48 --> 1984.88
or even if you would move around they

1982.64 --> 1988.5590000000002
stay perfectly rigid in their spin

1984.88 --> 1991.279
orientation as they started up

1988.559 --> 1992.8799999999999
because earth is stationary

1991.279 --> 1994.32
and it's not a sphere

1992.88 --> 1996.64
you move around with a mechanical

1994.32 --> 1998.48
gyroscope it's going to stay in exactly

1996.64 --> 1999.519
the same orientation

1998.48 --> 2002.3990000000001
why

1999.519 --> 2005.6
because the orientation

2002.399 --> 2008.6399999999999
of the earth's surface is a uniform

2005.6 --> 2010.799
right a uniform flat plane

2008.64 --> 2013.519
orientation of this rigid device called

2010.799 --> 2016.08
a gyroscope mechanical one is going to

2013.519 --> 2019.84
stay exactly the same

2016.08 --> 2019.84
because the earth's surface is flat

2034.08 --> 2037.12
what are you talking about

2038.96 --> 2043.24
hey clutch good to see you

2055.0 --> 2058.96
[Music]

2056.48 --> 2061.28
oh god so

2058.96 --> 2063.119
it's not [ __ ] everything i said is

2061.28 --> 2063.9190000000003
true

2063.119 --> 2065.44
like

2063.919 --> 2067.679
absolutely

2065.44 --> 2070.159
provably true

2067.679 --> 2072.399
and no nathan did not tell me that yeah

2070.159 --> 2074.48
the whole geometric orientation of the

2072.399 --> 2076.3199999999997
earth's surface

2074.48 --> 2079.44
that's mine

2076.32 --> 2081.599
i'm the one that put that down on the

2079.44 --> 2083.919
flat earth debate me

2081.599 --> 2087.3590000000004
yeah i'm the one that started saying

2083.919 --> 2089.919
that in 2017 i remember

2087.359 --> 2092.24
because it became an issue when baller

2089.919 --> 2094.1589999999997
said but it's not flirt and some flat

2092.24 --> 2096.1589999999997
earthers

2094.159 --> 2098.2400000000002
were saying that too and complaining

2096.159 --> 2101.04
about it but it's not blood because

2098.24 --> 2103.4399999999996
there's mountains so it's like yeah okay

2101.04 --> 2106.16
let me rephrase flat earth then the

2103.44 --> 2107.2000000000003
geometric orientation of the earth's

2106.16 --> 2110.64
surface

2107.2 --> 2112.72
is flat it's a perfect flat plane

2110.64 --> 2115.5989999999997
yeah that's me

2112.72 --> 2116.64
saying that not nathan telling me i

2115.599 --> 2118.88
don't

2116.64 --> 2120.72
do as i'm told i

2118.88 --> 2123.2000000000003
literally

2120.72 --> 2125.4399999999996
figure out things and then i put them

2123.2 --> 2125.4399999999996
down

2127.599 --> 2133.28
nobody tells me what to say

2131.04 --> 2136.24
i might take

2133.28 --> 2138.5600000000004
something somebody else said

2136.24 --> 2143.8799999999997
and make it my own

2138.56 --> 2143.88
but on average i even try to avoid that

2144.8 --> 2151.7200000000003
i would typically like to rephrase it in

2147.599 --> 2151.7200000000003
a more arwenian way

2167.119 --> 2174.079
where did the 15 degrees come

2170.839 --> 2175.839
from light spitting

2174.079 --> 2177.6800000000003
where did it come i did not come from

2175.839 --> 2179.52
earth spinning

2177.68 --> 2182.0
my hat ma

2179.52 --> 2182.0
kote

2184.24 --> 2189.7599999999998
yeah because it was only the rig laser

2186.48 --> 2190.64
gyroscope that did this weird odd 15

2189.76 --> 2194.079
degree

2190.64 --> 2194.0789999999997
rotation yeah

2194.64 --> 2198.72
not the other ones

2196.24 --> 2202.72
i said this yesterday

2198.72 --> 2202.72
yeah you understand i'm not here

2203.2 --> 2209.1189999999997
to keep telling you like these basic

2206.079 --> 2211.76
facts like you're some dementia patient

2209.119 --> 2214.32
i'm not here to just keep saying the

2211.76 --> 2217.2000000000003
same things over and over again every

2214.32 --> 2219.599
single day the rest of my life because

2217.2 --> 2222.3199999999997
you keep forgetting

2219.599 --> 2222.32
you understand

2223.28 --> 2229.44
i'm not here to say the same thing

2226.56 --> 2232.0
in response to a stupid outdated

2229.44 --> 2233.44
question or statement over and over and

2232.0 --> 2235.76
over again

2233.44 --> 2237.839
yeah you're going to have to figure out

2235.76 --> 2240.0
how to remember

2237.839 --> 2243.839
the answer

2240.0 --> 2246.96
yeah write it down somewhere

2243.839 --> 2246.96
pin it on your wall

2247.04 --> 2252.64
i'm not here to answer the same dumb

2248.96 --> 2252.64
questions over and over again every

2254.839 --> 2258.56
day experiment

2261.76 --> 2267.28
the black swan observation bob nodell

2265.04 --> 2269.04
black swan observation

2267.28 --> 2272.4
see too far

2269.04 --> 2272.4
for the earth to be a globe

2272.64 --> 2278.8799999999997
put your camera

2275.119 --> 2280.56
like two inches above sea level on the

2278.88 --> 2285.359
beach

2280.56 --> 2288.48
and then you see things very far away

2285.359 --> 2290.96
there's no way in hell

2288.48 --> 2293.76
that that could be possible on the globe

2290.96 --> 2295.839
no way in hell

2293.76 --> 2298.88
because on the globe

2295.839 --> 2300.64
the ocean right in front of you would

2298.88 --> 2302.0
block it

2300.64 --> 2304.96
and it isn't

2302.0 --> 2309.119
you can see miles and miles away at like

2304.96 --> 2309.119
two inches observation height okay

2309.44 --> 2314.8
that cannot ever happen on the globe

2313.359 --> 2317.119
ever

2314.8 --> 2319.76
like that's absolutely

2317.119 --> 2323.92
impossible

2319.76 --> 2327.119
can we see your photos why do we need my

2323.92 --> 2329.2000000000003
what the [ __ ] is this my photos what i

2327.119 --> 2331.6800000000003
have to do every [ __ ] little thing

2329.2 --> 2331.68
myself

2332.4 --> 2337.359
like oh i can't use anything anybody

2334.96 --> 2340.48
ever did i have to be a completely

2337.359 --> 2343.44
isolated from the entire world world

2340.48 --> 2346.079
special boy and i have to get every

2343.44 --> 2348.8
[ __ ] little piece of evidence all

2346.079 --> 2350.4
myself only ever

2348.8 --> 2352.8
it's ridiculous

2350.4 --> 2354.88
there's hundreds of people out there

2352.8 --> 2356.96
doing this kind of photography it's like

2354.88 --> 2359.119
their life it's their thing

2356.96 --> 2361.92
it's not my thing

2359.119 --> 2364.8
my thing is talking about it

2361.92 --> 2366.88
explaining things complex esoteric

2364.8 --> 2369.44
things spirit mechanics that's my

2366.88 --> 2371.52
specialty my specialty is not taking a

2369.44 --> 2373.839
camera and then doing all those

2371.52 --> 2376.24
observations because otherwise it

2373.839 --> 2379.4
doesn't count like what the [ __ ] wrong

2376.24 --> 2379.3999999999996
with you

2382.16 --> 2388.48
yeah we see too far yeah we do yeah if

2386.079 --> 2389.8390000000004
the earth were a globe you couldn't see

2388.48 --> 2393.119
that

2389.839 --> 2396.96
because the curvature would be

2393.119 --> 2400.2400000000002
physically blocking it from your site at

2396.96 --> 2402.7200000000003
that incredibly low observation height

2400.24 --> 2405.52
and it isn't

2402.72 --> 2408.56
thus the earth is in the globe black

2405.52 --> 2410.48
swan argument

2408.56 --> 2413.92
we've only been talking about it for

2410.48 --> 2413.92
like four years now

2414.319 --> 2419.7599999999998
on like a daily basis it's a

2417.119 --> 2424.28
standard housekeeping question

2419.76 --> 2424.28
any proof of earth curvature

2433.48 --> 2442.319
[Music]

2440.24 --> 2445.359
so you're done now

2442.319 --> 2445.359
you're done squirting

2446.4 --> 2450.7200000000003
good

2448.079 --> 2453.8390000000004
earth is flat

2450.72 --> 2453.839
it is it's not a ball

2454.96 --> 2460.57
the entire ball model is based off a

2457.92 --> 2463.7090000000003
flat plane

2460.57 --> 2463.7090000000003
[Music]

2471.92 --> 2476.64
pretty bad refraction no that's a

2474.0 --> 2476.64
paradox

2476.72 --> 2483.04
yeah bad refraction

2479.599 --> 2486.079
by the way there are thousands of photos

2483.04 --> 2488.24
showing you can see too far yeah

2486.079 --> 2490.5600000000004
thousands by now

2488.24 --> 2493.4399999999996
it's people doing that on a daily basis

2490.56 --> 2496.4
for several years now there's more

2493.44 --> 2498.0
observations like that than we can track

2496.4 --> 2500.0
down

2498.0 --> 2502.56
all right

2500.0 --> 2505.68
and it's not pretty bad refraction yeah

2502.56 --> 2507.04
refraction actual optics based

2505.68 --> 2510.8799999999997
refraction

2507.04 --> 2512.64
does not displace the horizon

2510.88 --> 2515.92
an apparent

2512.64 --> 2519.68
phenomenon within observation yeah where

2515.92 --> 2524.56
the sky appears to meet the ground or c

2519.68 --> 2527.5989999999997
that apparent effect cannot be displaced

2524.56 --> 2529.92
by refraction the actual refraction in

2527.599 --> 2531.2000000000003
optics that's provable and empirical

2529.92 --> 2533.2000000000003
yeah

2531.2 --> 2535.96
terrestrial refraction

2533.2 --> 2538.64
is a conjured machination that

2535.96 --> 2540.4
presupposes the radius value and

2538.64 --> 2542.96
incorporates that

2540.4 --> 2544.2400000000002
within a suggestion that light bends

2542.96 --> 2545.839
around it

2544.24 --> 2547.359
spherically

2545.839 --> 2550.16
which it doesn't

2547.359 --> 2553.7599999999998
light doesn't bend

2550.16 --> 2556.56
in circular fashion through a a medium

2553.76 --> 2558.7200000000003
that is consist that's persistent that's

2556.56 --> 2561.92
like singular pressure singular amount

2558.72 --> 2563.1189999999997
of refraction index yeah it does not

2561.92 --> 2566.079
bend

2563.119 --> 2568.56
through a cohesive medium

2566.079 --> 2570.4
that's not how refraction works

2568.56 --> 2572.319
that's a suggestion

2570.4 --> 2574.0
a machination called terrestrial

2572.319 --> 2576.16
refraction

2574.0 --> 2578.16
it is pure [ __ ]

2576.16 --> 2581.1189999999997
there is no proof for it whatsoever it

2578.16 --> 2584.839
presupposes the radius value of earth

2581.119 --> 2584.839
within the formula

2586.95 --> 2590.08
[Music]

2598.319 --> 2601.56
[ __ ] off

2604.01 --> 2607.8790000000004
[Music]

2611.17 --> 2614.309
[Music]

2618.16 --> 2623.04
don't go over the horizon they disappear

2620.8 --> 2626.319
into the horizon

2623.04 --> 2630.72
and if your observation medium

2626.319 --> 2631.0099999999998
your eye if you will or camera or

2630.72 --> 2632.24
yeah

2631.01 --> 2634.4
[Music]

2632.24 --> 2639.1189999999997
has a bigger resolution

2634.4 --> 2642.0
you can literally see the ship again

2639.119 --> 2644.48
do you understand that cannot happen if

2642.0 --> 2646.88
it is actually disappearing because of a

2644.48 --> 2650.0
physical obstruction

2646.88 --> 2653.2000000000003
yeah if there's a physical obstruction

2650.0 --> 2655.52
doesn't matter how high a resolution you

2653.2 --> 2657.4399999999996
observe it with

2655.52 --> 2659.599
or how much you zoom in you're not going

2657.44 --> 2661.68
to see it because it's physically

2659.599 --> 2663.04
obstructed

2661.68 --> 2666.7999999999997
yeah

2663.04 --> 2668.079
now boats moving into the horizon

2666.8 --> 2670.8
are not

2668.079 --> 2674.96
physically obstructed

2670.8 --> 2676.2400000000002
because if your resolution is higher

2674.96 --> 2679.44
because you have a really high

2676.24 --> 2682.8799999999997
resolution camera and you zoom in you

2679.44 --> 2684.7200000000003
see it again if it was physically

2682.88 --> 2688.56
obstructed

2684.72 --> 2690.72
you would not be able to see it again

2688.56 --> 2692.0789999999997
because it's physically obstructed all

2690.72 --> 2694.64
you'd get to see

2692.079 --> 2699.3590000000004
is a more detailed

2694.64 --> 2700.64
look on the physical obstruction

2699.359 --> 2704.24
yes

2700.64 --> 2706.64
am i getting through to you now

2704.24 --> 2708.64
did i do that experiment myself yes it's

2706.64 --> 2711.68
very easy

2708.64 --> 2713.44
like a camera with a zoom function you

2711.68 --> 2715.5989999999997
go to the beach

2713.44 --> 2717.28
where ships are

2715.599 --> 2718.8
you wait until you can't see them

2717.28 --> 2721.6800000000003
anymore

2718.8 --> 2724.2400000000002
then you pick up your camera you look at

2721.68 --> 2727.359
it you zoom in until you find it because

2724.24 --> 2730.16
you will find it because it didn't

2727.359 --> 2733.119
disappear behind

2730.16 --> 2736.0
the geometric horizon

2733.119 --> 2738.96
it simply disappeared into

2736.0 --> 2741.68
the apparent horizon

2738.96 --> 2743.52
because of the resolution limit of your

2741.68 --> 2746.64
eyes

2743.52 --> 2750.64
take a bigger observation

2746.64 --> 2754.4
system higher resolution and you'll see

2750.64 --> 2759.0789999999997
it again because it didn't disappear

2754.4 --> 2759.079
behind a geometric obstruction

2783.76 --> 2791.28
okay get the [ __ ] out i'm done with you

2788.319 --> 2794.419
it's just an anti-flat earther dick

2791.28 --> 2794.4190000000003
[Music]

2796.319 --> 2800.04
done with that [ __ ]

2806.0 --> 2811.119
all right this is not a mental award for

2808.48 --> 2813.359
baller retards you understand if you're

2811.119 --> 2817.2000000000003
too stupid to get this

to some dementia the demented idiot that

2828.64 --> 2834.56
keeps just asking stupid questions

2832.24 --> 2837.839
yeah because there are such things as

2834.56 --> 2840.24
stupid questions yeah the stupid

2837.839 --> 2842.7999999999997
questions being the questions that keep

2840.24 --> 2845.359
being asked over and over again even

2842.8 --> 2847.52
though they've been answered thousands

2845.359 --> 2850.16

2847.52 --> 2854.079
yeah that's a stupid question i'm not

2850.16 --> 2857.3999999999996
here to entertain your dementia okay

[Music]

2896.0 --> 2898.72
hey jesse

2897.44 --> 2901.7200000000003
uh

2898.72 --> 2901.72
no

2902.48 --> 2907.92
there has not been like a deconstruction

2904.72 --> 2907.9199999999996
of awake souls model

2908.4 --> 2912.28
i mean it has been addressed

2915.44 --> 2918.8
but there's too many like wild claims

2917.68 --> 2923.16
and

2918.8 --> 2923.1600000000003
fuzziness about it

2928.559 --> 2933.3590000000004
but if you ask me questions about it

2933.44 --> 2936.64
i can tell you things

2937.359 --> 2941.7599999999998
i mean i think that some of awake souls

2939.68 --> 2943.359
ideas are actually kind of halfway

2941.76 --> 2945.8390000000004
decent

2943.359 --> 2948.72
i think that he has actually whether he

2945.839 --> 2951.68
fully realize it or

2948.72 --> 2954.319
explains it the way that i would

2951.68 --> 2957.359
and he seems to have an understanding of

2954.319 --> 2959.359
the the pure non-local holographic

2957.359 --> 2962.88
nature of the celestial lights including

2959.359 --> 2965.7599999999998
the sun he seems to have attempted to

2962.88 --> 2969.079
3d model that out i saw that that was

2965.76 --> 2969.079
pretty impressive

2970.079 --> 2976.6400000000003
as for his map layout

2973.44 --> 2976.64
weird warped

2977.839 --> 2980.24
i mean

2980.72 --> 2985.16
he seems to be onto looping

2987.76 --> 2991.2000000000003
which is like interesting

2991.92 --> 2996.64
but i don't know why he has to have his

2994.319 --> 2998.72
weird map the way he does it seems like

2996.64 --> 3001.52
he made that map just so that he could

2998.72 --> 3003.5989999999997
present it as is this his special boy

3001.52 --> 3006.079
map right

3003.599 --> 3007.92
like that's his map

3006.079 --> 3009.3590000000004
nobody can say anything about it because

3007.92 --> 3011.359
it's his

3009.359 --> 3012.96
that seems like it's more driven

3011.359 --> 3015.7599999999998
by that like

3012.96 --> 3017.599
taking up his turf and protecting his

3015.76 --> 3020.1600000000003
honor with his design

3017.599 --> 3022.3500000000004
rather than actually trying to really

3020.16 --> 3024.0789999999997
figure out what the hell is going on

3022.35 --> 3026.88
[Music]

3024.079 --> 3028.8
but yeah some of his ideas are

3026.88 --> 3030.7200000000003
halfway decent

3028.8 --> 3032.559
it's just that everything in between is

3030.72 --> 3035.1189999999997
just garbage

3032.559 --> 3038.1600000000003
and savonia complex

3035.119 --> 3038.1600000000003

[Music]

3052.8 --> 3058.079
more like asteroids map what does that

3055.839 --> 3058.0789999999997
mean

3062.16 --> 3069.839
the claim is that particular map has the

3065.28 --> 3069.8390000000004
least amount of distortion of land

3072.24 --> 3075.24
no

3083.28 --> 3086.88
like i don't think so

3088.4 --> 3092.64
besides uh

3090.24 --> 3096.0789999999997
i did i think he's pretty much ignored a

3092.64 --> 3097.359
lot of the ocean bottom in that

3096.079 --> 3100.559
right

3097.359 --> 3102.0789999999997
to truly figure out the euclidean nature

3100.559 --> 3104.48
of it all

3102.079 --> 3108.2400000000002
it might simply be

3104.48 --> 3110.4
impossible to actually perfectly

3108.24 --> 3114.3999999999996
give you a two scale map where

3110.4 --> 3115.92
everything is as is it might be 100

3114.4 --> 3120.559
impossible

3115.92 --> 3122.559
right it may simply be unmappable

3120.559 --> 3124.8
like you can map it but there will

3122.559 --> 3127.52
always be distortions no matter what you

3124.8 --> 3129.6800000000003
do and it's impossible to avoid

3127.52 --> 3132.72
that might be the case

3129.68 --> 3135.2799999999997
right spatial non-linearity

3132.72 --> 3139.0
it's what i suspected

3135.28 --> 3139.0
seven years ago

3151.76 --> 3155.3590000000004
asteroid portal what

3159.839 --> 3163.07
no it doesn't make any sense that's

3161.52 --> 3166.209

[Music]

3195.48 --> 3200.319
[Music]

3197.839 --> 3204.04
i think that information is like you can

3200.319 --> 3204.04
look that up in

3208.64 --> 3212.7999999999997
like their special physics and chemistry

3210.48 --> 3216.319
books what do you call them again

3212.8 --> 3216.319
they'll also have the periodic table

3220.16 --> 3225.5589999999997
i i wish i never sold that book because

3222.319 --> 3225.5589999999997
they're great

3230.95 --> 3234.1299999999997
[Music]

3240.64 --> 3245.52
although yeah i did also i do have some

3243.359 --> 3245.52
like

3247.52 --> 3253.2
books about different types of gems and

3250.079 --> 3254.6400000000003
they too have like refraction index

3253.2 --> 3256.64
indicators

3254.64 --> 3258.72
like every type of material has a

3256.64 --> 3261.04
refraction index

3258.72 --> 3262.7999999999997
it's even how you can identify certain

3261.04 --> 3264.8
type of gems

3262.8 --> 3268.119
and distinguish them from

3264.8 --> 3268.119
like falsifications

3271.2 --> 3276.16
i should write a book oh oh yes of

3273.76 --> 3276.1600000000003
course

3276.4 --> 3279.839
just write a book

3310.35 --> 3313.5989999999997
[Music]

3311.68 --> 3314.96
it does work

3313.599 --> 3318.44
north and

3314.96 --> 3318.44
south too

3323.839 --> 3329.2799999999997
right well i think that

3327.04 --> 3332.24
we don't fully understand even like what

3329.28 --> 3335.119
the north and south is really like

3332.24 --> 3337.839
right

3335.119 --> 3337.839
i don't know

3339.28 --> 3346.079
is the north really small

3342.72 --> 3348.48
that it would fit in between

3346.079 --> 3350.6400000000003
everything like in between the equator

3348.48 --> 3354.0
and all that

3350.64 --> 3356.0
is it much smaller is it really

3354.0 --> 3358.48
or is that just like the

3356.0 --> 3361.119
the kind of the the hazard of

3358.48 --> 3363.599
presupposing it's disk oriented it's

3361.119 --> 3366.6400000000003
like a literal euclidean disc

3363.599 --> 3366.6400000000003
because i don't think it is

3367.92 --> 3371.359
i don't know if the

3371.76 --> 3378.3190000000004
the south pole region if it is even big

3374.48 --> 3378.319
enough to completely surround

3378.48 --> 3384.2400000000002
everything within the realm

3381.599 --> 3386.0
so for me the the go-to assumption has

3384.24 --> 3388.64
always been like no it's just

3386.0 --> 3391.44
rectangular it's probably the same maybe

3388.64 --> 3393.5989999999997
uneven rectangular maybe

3391.44 --> 3395.92
the south is slightly wider than the

3393.599 --> 3396.92
north

3395.92 --> 3402.079
but not

3396.92 --> 3402.079
360. it's not like that at all

3402.24 --> 3409.5989999999997
it's definitely not that big antarctica

3405.119 --> 3409.599
is definitely like not as big

3409.68 --> 3413.2
as like

3410.88 --> 3417.4
two times africa or something it's

3413.2 --> 3417.3999999999996
definitely not that big

3427.26 --> 3432.099
[Music]

3438.64 --> 3443.64
hmm

3439.76 --> 3443.6400000000003
okay jesse interesting

3466.24 --> 3470.64
yeah

3468.0 --> 3475.319
now the speed of light is is basically

3470.64 --> 3475.319
based on an astronomical fiction

3475.52 --> 3479.839
because

3477.04 --> 3483.2
i think that the insane speeds of light

3479.839 --> 3484.88
were specifically created

3483.2 --> 3487.04
to

3484.88 --> 3489.76
accommodate for

3487.04 --> 3492.72
the astronomical

3489.76 --> 3494.559
sizes within the heliocentric model

3492.72 --> 3497.1189999999997
to basically be able to bridge that

3494.559 --> 3497.119
distance

3497.2 --> 3502.319
right because

3499.28 --> 3505.3590000000004
in the short scale like on earth it's

3502.319 --> 3508.799
like it's not big enough to even be able

3505.359 --> 3508.799
to prove how fast it is

3509.28 --> 3513.599
and i think that was on purpose they

3510.88 --> 3515.6800000000003
always made it like an astronomical

3513.599 --> 3516.4
speed

3515.68 --> 3518.48
to

3516.4 --> 3520.2400000000002
basically start puzzling with that

3518.48 --> 3522.48
within the presupposition of the

3520.24 --> 3523.7599999999998
heliocentric model and its astronomical

3522.48 --> 3527.839
distances

3523.76 --> 3527.8390000000004
that's where they conjured it up for

3528.079 --> 3531.28
right

3528.88 --> 3533.6800000000003
i don't think it was ever even attempted

3531.28 --> 3536.799
to be proven here on earth

3533.68 --> 3539.1189999999997
like the only way they even suggest to

3536.799 --> 3541.7599999999998
prove the speed of light is to

3539.119 --> 3544.4
freaking measure supposed light speed

3541.76 --> 3548.079
with some celestial body it's always the

3544.4 --> 3549.839
same [ __ ] always the same [ __ ]

3548.079 --> 3552.8390000000004

3665.52 --> 3671.2

3668.559 --> 3673.28
i made a long time ago it's it's just a

3671.2 --> 3677.839
stupid pencil sketch right there's no

3673.28 --> 3677.8390000000004
color drawings with me just the sketch

3680.079 --> 3685.76
but let it show let me show it to you

3682.96 --> 3687.92
to show you how at the time at least

3685.76 --> 3690.76
i envisioned

3687.92 --> 3693.119
what the holographic sunlight

3690.76 --> 3695.8390000000004
manifestation is like

3693.119 --> 3697.359
compared to how people think it is in

3695.839 --> 3700.88
their minds typically because of

3697.359 --> 3700.88
physicality assumption bias

3701.44 --> 3704.44
what

3720.319 --> 3722.88
there you go

3723.68 --> 3728.8799999999997
on the right side of the page

3726.559 --> 3730.88
that's how people probably

3728.88 --> 3734.079
let earthers think

3730.88 --> 3737.28
in their minds what the sun is like

3734.079 --> 3737.28
because you have to be

3738.48 --> 3743.92
on the left is how i think the light

3742.48 --> 3746.72
manifests

3743.92 --> 3748.16
without an actual origin point like a

3746.72 --> 3750.16
lamp

3748.16 --> 3751.5989999999997
the celestial lights including the sun

3750.16 --> 3754.0
are like

3751.599 --> 3758.079
it's light manifest it arrives it

3754.0 --> 3758.079
doesn't actually come from anything

3758.24 --> 3762.56
and the weird cone shape

3760.48 --> 3763.92
that thins down

3762.56 --> 3768.48
[Music]

3763.92 --> 3771.2000000000003
is basically how you see the sun within

3768.48 --> 3771.2
that space

3773.76 --> 3779.76
literally you go towards it and then it

3776.16 --> 3779.7599999999998
might disappear altogether

3780.4 --> 3785.599
or it'll bend away

3783.119 --> 3785.599
at least

3787.92 --> 3792.799
yeah so every time i say that oh it's

3790.319 --> 3794.319
just light manifest and then everybody

3792.799 --> 3797.359
starts squirting like oh that's

3794.319 --> 3800.24
ridiculous preposterous

3797.359 --> 3802.96
demonstrate that here on earth then oh

3800.24 --> 3805.9199999999996
thank you how you can't even do that

3802.96 --> 3809.28
yeah i know i know

3805.92 --> 3811.76
it's celestial it's mystical god

3809.28 --> 3814.559

3811.76 --> 3816.48

3824.88 --> 3829.599
that's the only option left to me to to

3827.68 --> 3832.16
figure out what it is

3829.599 --> 3836.839
and this is a representation of it

3832.16 --> 3836.839
that i drew out like three years ago

3841.28 --> 3844.28
uh

3857.52 --> 3859.839

3860.079 --> 3863.96

seems like

4012.0 --> 4016.96
dr dyna already

4014.96 --> 4019.96
got an answer to this question i guess i

4016.96 --> 4019.96
know

4022.0 --> 4026.559
are they lying

4023.68 --> 4030.1189999999997
yeah no [ __ ] dr dino you really think

4026.559 --> 4030.119
they're not lying

4065.84 --> 4068.889
[Music]

4075.839 --> 4077.92
you

4106.319 --> 4111.6
and check nasa's claim for yourself

4109.279 --> 4114.159000000001
well jesse

4111.6 --> 4115.04
that's technically true

4114.159 --> 4117.199
but

4115.04 --> 4119.199
beside that

4117.199 --> 4121.199
beside like the claims that they have

4119.199 --> 4123.44
made about the composition of the

4121.199 --> 4127.5199999999995
universe etc

4123.44 --> 4130.48
they also literally get caught lying

4127.52 --> 4132.400000000001
and deceiving people

4130.48 --> 4134.4
like oh look we're on the space station

4132.4 --> 4136.639999999999
oh damn it i got caught in my wires

4134.4 --> 4139.839
again or oh i tried to grab something it

4136.64 --> 4143.4400000000005
wasn't actually there yeah that's lying

4139.839 --> 4143.44
they do it provably

4143.52 --> 4148.719
and continually this is not like oh the

4146.239 --> 4150.959999999999
a rare occasion occurred where something

4148.719 --> 4152.159
went wrong no this is freaking happening

4150.96 --> 4156.2390000000005
like on a

4152.159 --> 4158.639999999999
weekly basis they [ __ ] up constantly

4156.239 --> 4161.599999999999
revealing that they're literally

4158.64 --> 4165.12
deceiving you

4161.6 --> 4167.279
right and that that's separate

4165.12 --> 4169.679
from the supposed claims of the

4167.279 --> 4172.080000000001
composition of our of the universe and

4169.679 --> 4175.92
all that right that's separate they're

4172.08 --> 4178.159
already like provably caught lying

4175.92 --> 4180.4
constantly

4178.159 --> 4180.4
right

4180.88 --> 4186.0
why would you listen to any organization

4183.6 --> 4189.359
that just constantly

4186.0 --> 4192.239
provably lies to you why would you even

4189.359 --> 4192.2390000000005
reference those

4194.56 --> 4199.679
it's not about whether they're convinced

4196.8 --> 4202.400000000001
about what they're saying

4199.679 --> 4205.76
they aren't they're lying their shills

4202.4 --> 4209.799999999999
they put on nasa voice and nasa face and

4205.76 --> 4209.8
tell [ __ ] stories

4217.12 --> 4221.36
you don't know who to believe

4219.28 --> 4224.8
it's not about who to believe

4221.36 --> 4227.28
you just need to use your faculties

4224.8 --> 4230.400000000001
yeah it's not about who to believe it's

4227.28 --> 4232.4
about does it make sense

4230.4 --> 4236.239
you get it

4232.4 --> 4238.879999999999
you can't just leave every cognitive

4236.239 --> 4241.919999999999
function to another person unless you're

4238.88 --> 4246.0
like a clinically provable [ __ ] and

4241.92 --> 4247.84
you literally cannot think for yourself

4246.0 --> 4250.719
and you're lucky enough to even be able

4247.84 --> 4252.719
to communicate understandably

4250.719 --> 4254.159
then i'd get it like yeah oh you can't

4252.719 --> 4257.04
do it i have to

4254.159 --> 4259.12
ask somebody right

4257.04 --> 4261.84
if you're not that

4259.12 --> 4263.36
degenerated not blaming anybody that is

4261.84 --> 4265.76
right you can help it if you're born

4263.36 --> 4265.759999999999
like that

4266.159 --> 4270.5599999999995
but

4266.96 --> 4275.28
if you're not then there's no excuse you

4270.56 --> 4276.8
need to figure it out logically if you

4275.28 --> 4279.44
don't

4276.8 --> 4282.0
you're never gonna understand anything

4279.44 --> 4284.32
you're just gonna jump from one guru to

4282.0 --> 4286.719
another as nathan oakley would say it

4284.32 --> 4290.239
from one guru to another

4286.719 --> 4291.44
you have to figure it out not listen to

4290.239 --> 4294.799999999999
somebody

4291.44 --> 4297.04
telling you how things are you have to

4294.8 --> 4300.96
figure it out

4297.04 --> 4302.08
right so listen to people that tell you

4300.96 --> 4304.4800000000005
how they

4302.08 --> 4306.32
figured it out

4304.48 --> 4308.919999999999
what trainer thinking what proof they

4306.32 --> 4310.48
used and then you have to

4308.92 --> 4312.32
understand

4310.48 --> 4315.12
what that is

4312.32 --> 4317.599999999999
what they're actually saying why they're

4315.12 --> 4320.4
saying it how does that work what did

4317.6 --> 4322.56
they do you have to actually

4320.4 --> 4324.799999999999
think about it

4322.56 --> 4327.04
and not just like oh he said it very

4324.8 --> 4328.88
convincingly i'm going to believe

4327.04 --> 4332.239
everything he says now no you have to

4328.88 --> 4335.52
actually let it in your head separate

4332.239 --> 4337.919999999999
and then figure it out

4335.52 --> 4342.4800000000005
you have to do that

4337.92 --> 4346.12
if you can't you're a clinical [ __ ]

4342.48 --> 4346.12
and you got a problem

4353.48 --> 4359.099999999999
[Music]

4363.03 --> 4370.33
[Music]

4374.64 --> 4379.12
yeah i mean nobody's expecting

4380.239 --> 4384.28
what's his freaking name again

4385.36 --> 4388.48
from family guy

4391.36 --> 4394.4
the

4392.48 --> 4397.199
the big [ __ ] guy

4394.4 --> 4399.92
nobody's expecting him to get this [ __ ]

4397.199 --> 4401.44
right because you know he is clinically

4399.92 --> 4402.96
[ __ ]

4401.44 --> 4404.239
so nobody's going to blame him yeah of

4402.96 --> 4406.4800000000005
course he's going to be annoying and

4404.239 --> 4409.919999999999
he's even going to troll but you know he

4406.48 --> 4413.599999999999
wouldn't get it yeah peter that's right

4409.92 --> 4416.56
peter griffin right

4413.6 --> 4418.96
you know he's not gonna get it he might

4416.56 --> 4423.64
still be able to troll you about it but

4418.96 --> 4423.64
you know he wouldn't get it

4429.36 --> 4435.36
which is by the way odd because

4432.4 --> 4437.199
he has random mind rotations

4435.36 --> 4438.96
so maybe at some point he would just

4437.199 --> 4441.12
suddenly get it and then he wouldn't get

4438.96 --> 4442.64
the other side that's typically how that

4441.12 --> 4444.5599999999995
plays out right

4442.64 --> 4448.2390000000005
peter griffin is a guy that just doesn't

4444.56 --> 4450.8
have any control over his own faculties

4448.239 --> 4453.12
like his ego has full control over his

4450.8 --> 4454.400000000001
faculties and his ego likes to [ __ ] with

4453.12 --> 4456.4
him

4454.4 --> 4457.839999999999
so that suddenly sometimes he

4456.4 --> 4459.679
understands things and then he just

4457.84 --> 4461.1990000000005
doesn't understand things he has no

4459.679 --> 4462.159
control over it

4461.199 --> 4464.639999999999
right

4462.159 --> 4467.92
it's like hyperactivism

4464.64 --> 4470.08
except with really bad ego on top that

4467.92 --> 4473.04
has full control that's kind of what

4470.08 --> 4473.04
peter griffin is

4473.199 --> 4478.719
he's effectively possessed

4476.0 --> 4480.88
and it's really funny right

4478.719 --> 4482.56
it's funny it's kind of creepy and it's

4480.88 --> 4485.28
funny

4482.56 --> 4486.8
and we know people that actually weirdly

4485.28 --> 4488.88
act like that

4486.8 --> 4491.1990000000005
they just don't have control over their

4488.88 --> 4493.1990000000005
faculties sometimes they're just stupid

4491.199 --> 4496.32
and they won't get it and then another

4493.199 --> 4498.639999999999
time they certainly do get it

4496.32 --> 4500.88
and they don't know why

4498.64 --> 4502.96
why their brain refused to work in that

4500.88 --> 4506.159000000001
moment and then another time it does

4502.96 --> 4506.159
work they don't understand

4506.56 --> 4512.81
and they have no impulse control usually

4509.67 --> 4512.81
[Music]

4524.719 --> 4529.84
they lost tons of subs what are you

4526.88 --> 4529.84
talking about clutch

4530.0 --> 4533.28
it's the program

4533.52 --> 4536.52
what

4551.28 --> 4555.199
facts are facts because of experiments

4553.76 --> 4557.92
right

4555.199 --> 4561.04
no facts are logic

4557.92 --> 4561.04
facts are logical

4563.92 --> 4570.08
and empirical on top of that but it

4567.28 --> 4572.159
starts with logic

4570.08 --> 4576.199
and the empiricism is the cherry on top

4572.159 --> 4576.199
that confirms it

4581.679 --> 4585.6
netflix what

4584.08 --> 4588.4
oh right yeah i've heard that yeah

4585.6 --> 4588.400000000001
netflix is

4589.04 --> 4595.6
is like grinding down slowly to a halt

4593.52 --> 4598.159000000001
because all the new [ __ ] that's coming

4595.6 --> 4600.56
out is just getting worse and worse

4598.159 --> 4602.799999999999
and people aren't interested i mean

4600.56 --> 4605.4400000000005
i'm not really interested i use netflix

4602.8 --> 4607.04
but most of the time i just watch old

4605.44 --> 4609.44
movies

4607.04 --> 4612.0
i'm like yeah

4609.44 --> 4613.36
everything up to pretty much 2010 is

4612.0 --> 4615.6
like yeah

4613.36 --> 4615.599999999999
cool

4616.4 --> 4620.4
and then

4617.84 --> 4622.56
like all the newer [ __ ] it just makes me

4620.4 --> 4626.0
want to throw up i just immediately

4622.56 --> 4628.4800000000005
picture like these insane sjws making

4626.0 --> 4630.159
that [ __ ] and i'm like god i

4628.48 --> 4633.199
can't watch this

4630.159 --> 4634.639999999999
it's all garbage

4633.199 --> 4637.839999999999
it's like

4634.64 --> 4639.92
the sjw [ __ ] and the disgusting

4637.84 --> 4642.88
seductions aren't getting too

4639.92 --> 4646.32
off-putting and distracting to enjoy the

4642.88 --> 4646.32
rest of the entire show

4649.679 --> 4654.4
and that's not even shows that are

4651.36 --> 4658.0
particularly focused on doing that right

4654.4 --> 4661.759999999999
it's even in just general products

4658.0 --> 4665.84
general productions terrible

4661.76 --> 4668.88
and the shows that avoid it entirely are

4665.84 --> 4670.0
like immediately like this is the best

4668.88 --> 4672.88
it's like

4670.0 --> 4676.96
all you have to do is erase

4672.88 --> 4678.4800000000005
every little chiseling trace every

4676.96 --> 4679.88
little chase

4678.48 --> 4681.599999999999
of even the

4679.88 --> 4685.84
conception

4681.6 --> 4688.2390000000005
of woke erase it erase it from every

4685.84 --> 4689.679
detail in the script everything

4688.239 --> 4693.44
everything

4689.679 --> 4695.92
i guarantee you your show will be a hit

4693.44 --> 4696.96
and will get like 10 times the expected

4695.92 --> 4700.0
score

4696.96 --> 4702.159
just because you completely erased all

4700.0 --> 4706.08
the work [ __ ]

4702.159 --> 4708.719
if you do that you will be a success

4706.08 --> 4710.48
i guarantee it to you if you are winnie

4708.719 --> 4714.2390000000005
and guarantee

4710.48 --> 4716.639999999999
erase every trace of woke in your

4714.239 --> 4718.839999999999
in your movie or series

4716.64 --> 4722.88
every single

4718.84 --> 4725.52
trace like make work of it to like

4722.88 --> 4728.159000000001
actively counteract it

4725.52 --> 4730.159000000001
and you will have a successful siri

4728.159 --> 4733.5199999999995
pretty much no matter what it is even if

4730.159 --> 4733.5199999999995
it's not even that inspired

4733.76 --> 4738.64
because people are so

4736.4 --> 4741.36
sick of it

4738.64 --> 4743.4400000000005
it's beyond

4741.36 --> 4745.92
beyond intolerance

4743.44 --> 4749.04
people are giving up on netflix

4745.92 --> 4751.92
specifically to boycott the woke [ __ ]

4749.04 --> 4752.96
specifically

4751.92 --> 4755.12
so

4752.96 --> 4756.2390000000005
don't do that anymore

4755.12 --> 4762.96
stop it

4756.239 --> 4766.919999999999
stop it or die netflix stop it or die

4762.96 --> 4766.92
that's the choice she got

4773.98 --> 4778.639999999999
[Music]

4776.48 --> 4781.04
right and there's i love some of these

4778.64 --> 4784.400000000001
stuff like

4781.04 --> 4788.0
therma romane novae

4784.4 --> 4789.44
was like that's a really new series

4788.0 --> 4790.88
very short one

4789.44 --> 4792.639999999999
really new

4790.88 --> 4796.08
and it is

4792.64 --> 4799.280000000001
zero woke zero about it i mean

4796.08 --> 4801.679
it's so natural it's almost surreal

4799.28 --> 4805.44
to me it's like from an it's like it's

4801.679 --> 4807.6
made in another era

4805.44 --> 4809.5199999999995
everything about it is awesome and like

4807.6 --> 4814.0
even the way it's like yeah people are

4809.52 --> 4817.040000000001
nude and it's not sexual

4814.0 --> 4819.84
like dude can you imagine that

4817.04 --> 4819.84
in this age

4819.92 --> 4824.719
i love it i love that series it is a

4822.32 --> 4827.5199999999995
netflix series right

4824.719 --> 4830.2390000000005
so make everything

4827.52 --> 4832.159000000001
like that not literally like that but

4830.239 --> 4833.5199999999995
go towards that direction with

4832.159 --> 4836.0
everything

4833.52 --> 4839.6
and you will

4836.0 --> 4841.92
return you will become successful again

4839.6 --> 4845.679
just avoid every

4841.92 --> 4848.08
single detailed trace of vocalism

4845.679 --> 4850.0
and you will be successful again

4848.08 --> 4851.5199999999995
just have to give up

4850.0 --> 4853.76
and the people that are obsessed with

4851.52 --> 4855.76
that in your ranks just

4853.76 --> 4857.360000000001
just tell them to commit suicide just go

4855.76 --> 4859.4400000000005
[ __ ] kill yourself

4857.36 --> 4860.48
everybody hates you you destroyed

4859.44 --> 4862.799999999999
netflix

4860.48 --> 4866.199
now [ __ ] off

4862.8 --> 4866.1990000000005
there you go

4876.39 --> 4879.469
[Music]

4881.679 --> 4886.32
an up tum turn in subs when the

4884.56 --> 4887.280000000001
strangest thing yeah

4886.32 --> 4889.679
maybe

4887.28 --> 4893.599999999999
logical conclusion but what if stranger

4889.679 --> 4893.6
things suddenly becomes more woke

4893.84 --> 4898.719
right i mean the cast is kind of into

4897.28 --> 4900.96
that [ __ ]

4898.719 --> 4905.04
unfortunately

4900.96 --> 4908.159
they're all a bunch of spoiled whiny

4905.04 --> 4910.88
californian [ __ ]

4908.159 --> 4912.638999999999
like all the actors in that

4910.88 --> 4915.96
or most of them

4912.639 --> 4915.96
like this

4916.159 --> 4920.159
it's not been that terrible

4919.12 --> 4922.8
right

4920.159 --> 4924.5599999999995
the the the yeah the series especially

4922.8 --> 4927.12
yeah it started out great it's getting

4924.56 --> 4928.6
less and less but it was great

4927.12 --> 4931.5199999999995
they can still

4928.6 --> 4934.56
completely ruin it you realize that they

4931.52 --> 4937.280000000001
can actually choose to completely [ __ ]

4934.56 --> 4938.0
it up and make it all work they can't do

4937.28 --> 4938.8
it

4938.0 --> 4940.96
right

4938.8 --> 4943.52
don't think that they wouldn't

4940.96 --> 4945.12
they'll [ __ ] it up they'll be like oh

4943.52 --> 4948.88
look at here's your favorite series is

4945.12 --> 4950.8

4948.88 --> 4954.639
it to death

4950.8 --> 4957.04
for our insane demonic ideology

4954.639 --> 4958.88
yeah that's what they do they literally

4957.04 --> 4962.08
take something that's beloved and then

4958.88 --> 4964.400000000001
they murder it right in front of you

4962.08 --> 4965.28
they murder everything about it that you

4964.4 --> 4967.04
like

4965.28 --> 4969.28
it's what they like to do they're

4967.04 --> 4972.94
demon-possessed freaks

4969.28 --> 4976.07
they all need to kill themselves

4972.94 --> 4976.07
[Music]

4980.08 --> 4983.6
so yeah

4981.36 --> 4984.639
maybe the news the new season will be

4983.6 --> 4987.280000000001

4998.32 --> 5003.12
the new season really bad
