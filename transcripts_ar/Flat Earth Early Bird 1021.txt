92.159 --> 95.92
and sunny

93.84 --> 98.72
but yeah that kind of surprised me

95.92 --> 101.04
because not even half an hour ago

98.72 --> 103.6
it was

101.04 --> 107.28
cloud-covered

103.6 --> 108.55999999999999
and gray and cold and it was like oh god

107.28 --> 111.04
restless

108.56 --> 112.399
shady but then suddenly

111.04 --> 115.2
well that changed

112.399 --> 117.68
a big blue

115.2 --> 120.07900000000001
spot appeared

117.68 --> 124.159
and yeah with the sun the sun when it

120.079 --> 124.15899999999999
gets through it is pretty delightful

124.399 --> 129.56
it's like this

125.84 --> 129.56
nice warm blanket

130.8 --> 136.56
but yeah the wind is rushing

134.16 --> 142.35999999999999
almost constantly and

136.56 --> 142.36
the clouds up there are moving very fast

143.44 --> 146.72
like

144.239 --> 147.76
very fast

146.72 --> 149.44
so

147.76 --> 150.56
yeah i don't know how long that's gonna

149.44 --> 152.48
last

150.56 --> 154.72
might be another cloud bank moving in

152.48 --> 157.84
front of the sun again

154.72 --> 157.84
we'll see

157.92 --> 163.2
but yeah it's kind of a restless

160.4 --> 163.20000000000002

but anyway he's not bothering me i

384.24 --> 389.08

yeah cleary

437.52 --> 442.31899999999996

yes

453.68 --> 457.599
you are all right cool

459.12 --> 463.039
i just watch it through

460.88 --> 464.96
well sometimes he has a youtube channel

463.039 --> 467.12
and then i can follow that

464.96 --> 470.35999999999996
but most of the times i just go to his

467.12 --> 470.36
bit shoot

478.479 --> 484.08
i yelled at you yesterday

481.36 --> 484.08000000000004
how is that

485.52 --> 489.75899999999996
i was pissed off at you yesterday though

489.84 --> 497.52
for your utter lack of control

494.479 --> 499.199
during your show

497.52 --> 502.4
like you did not

499.199 --> 502.40000000000003
you had no control

504.24 --> 509.199
and i was unprotected there and after it

507.199 --> 512.0
was made apparent that

509.199 --> 513.76
people are timing me out for absolutely

512.0 --> 516.08
no reason

513.76 --> 517.76
other than me just disagreeing without

516.08 --> 521.039
being offensive

517.76 --> 523.8389999999999
in the slightest despite getting at home

521.039 --> 526.88
even before

523.839 --> 528.399
i was even agitated

526.88 --> 530.24
and you didn't give me a wrench to

528.399 --> 534.48
protect me

530.24 --> 535.44
even though you know i am definitely

534.48 --> 537.9200000000001
like

535.44 --> 540.6400000000001
i don't see any reason why not you know

537.92 --> 543.4399999999999
i never abuse my wrench

540.64 --> 545.279
like i would never do that in your chat

543.44 --> 546.839
i would just operate under the same

545.279 --> 548.8
typical

546.839 --> 551.6800000000001
system

548.8 --> 554.8
right if some yeah if some gamma comes

551.68 --> 556.64
in and just yeah i mean stupid yeah then

554.8 --> 557.5999999999999
i'm gonna ban them right

556.64 --> 560.0
but

557.6 --> 560.0
come on

560.56 --> 564.56
that's logical i don't go beyond that if

562.64 --> 567.92
somebody has a different opinion i don't

564.56 --> 570.0799999999999
go after them i used to like three years

567.92 --> 571.68
ago

570.08 --> 574.64
but i've completely

571.68 --> 574.64
stopped doing that

575.04 --> 580.56
i guess only sometimes when i'm in a

577.68 --> 580.56
really bad mood

581.44 --> 585.44
but i only do it over at nathan's

583.36 --> 588.08
because nathan indulges himself to do

585.44 --> 588.08
that as well

589.2 --> 593.76
if he tells me i have to stop doing that

591.12 --> 593.76
and i will

593.839 --> 596.08
all right

595.279 --> 598.32
hey

596.08 --> 601.72
nathan oakley good to see you

598.32 --> 601.72
dutch sailor

611.519 --> 615.519
right

612.959 --> 618.2399999999999
okay well there you go good servant

615.519 --> 620.5600000000001
that means i will never visit your chat

618.24 --> 620.5600000000001
again

622.8 --> 630.1999999999999
because you discriminate

625.68 --> 630.1999999999999
based on philosophical grounds

632.079 --> 636.399
i think that that is actually a sin

637.519 --> 642.16
right

638.56 --> 644.079
and it gives me an impulse to get

642.16 --> 646.959
really rough

644.079 --> 649.76
really rough

646.959 --> 651.4399999999999
like let's see what happens when i turn

649.76 --> 652.959
inside out

651.44 --> 654.399
exactly

652.959 --> 656.2399999999999
the pattern

654.399 --> 660.64
that you

656.24 --> 663.04
are a part of by your own consent

660.64 --> 664.8
and then i'll show how ugly that really

663.04 --> 666.56
is and how

664.8 --> 668.56
fiendish it is

666.56 --> 670.959
and you don't even know it kind of like

668.56 --> 673.1199999999999
the ball religion in a way

670.959 --> 676.399
it's very similar

673.12 --> 677.839
and i despise people that latch onto

676.399 --> 680.8
that

677.839 --> 684.48
that abandon

680.8 --> 688.279
critical thinking and judgment over

684.48 --> 688.279
routine chance

689.12 --> 693.92
now i realize by jesus's teachings that

692.16 --> 696.56
people make their mistakes and then they

693.92 --> 699.5999999999999
have to figure out that it is a mistake

696.56 --> 701.5189999999999
it's a growing process sometimes

699.6 --> 703.839
you don't have everything available to

701.519 --> 705.519
even see it and then when you see it to

703.839 --> 707.7600000000001
overcome it it takes time it takes

705.519 --> 711.279
wisdom it takes

707.76 --> 713.36
also a dedication to keep growing

711.279 --> 716.32
to realize that that is the priority

713.36 --> 718.5600000000001
over whatever contemporary belief you

716.32 --> 720.8000000000001
may have really

718.56 --> 720.8
right

723.36 --> 726.639
so yeah if you

727.68 --> 732.3199999999999
are going to do

728.839 --> 734.8000000000001
that then well i'm not gonna i'm not

732.32 --> 738.0790000000001
gonna roll over you because

734.8 --> 739.76
i think it's an honest mistake

738.079 --> 741.519
but i'm not gonna visit your chat

739.76 --> 743.92
anymore because

741.519 --> 747.76
i'm not welcome there you already said

743.92 --> 749.5999999999999
it i am not part of your

747.76 --> 751.8389999999999
chant conviction

749.6 --> 753.6
you've separated me effectively

751.839 --> 755.36
discriminating against me because i

753.6 --> 756.639
don't deserve a range based on those

755.36 --> 759.839
grounds

756.639 --> 759.839
not based on trust

761.68 --> 764.8
right

762.959 --> 766.4799999999999
which is what the wrenches are really

764.8 --> 770.0
for

766.48 --> 773.12
here is a symbol of trust

770.0 --> 774.72
and responsibility

773.12 --> 776.48
right it's not like

774.72 --> 778.88
oh you

776.48 --> 780.5600000000001
you have this philosophical disagreement

778.88 --> 783.4399999999999
with me and therefore i will never give

780.56 --> 784.4799999999999
you a wrench now i've actually oh like

783.44 --> 786.48
even

784.48 --> 788.639
george sanford i'd given him a wrench

786.48 --> 790.48
but then he kind of like didn't want it

788.639 --> 791.6
didn't use it right so i took it away

790.48 --> 792.5600000000001
again

791.6 --> 795.36
but

792.56 --> 798.399
just because he is of a conviction that

795.36 --> 800.72
i find very agitating at times

798.399 --> 802.079
i'm not going to discriminate against

800.72 --> 804.32
him

802.079 --> 805.519
and just put him outside of a virtual

804.32 --> 807.7600000000001
box

805.519 --> 808.8
and treat him differently

807.76 --> 811.2
see

808.8 --> 814.24
that's discrimination

811.2 --> 817.44
and i know those things tend to sneak in

814.24 --> 817.44
in a very subtle way

823.12 --> 827.199
now of course if somebody has a certain

825.36 --> 828.399
conviction

827.199 --> 830.88
you will

828.399 --> 834.56
have to treat them differently in your

830.88 --> 837.8389999999999
social interactions but you don't just

834.56 --> 839.1199999999999
put them outside of a box

837.839 --> 841.44
right

839.12 --> 843.519
it has to be the interaction that you

841.44 --> 845.0400000000001
adapt to

843.519 --> 848.16
you don't just

845.04 --> 850.7199999999999
put them in some pen you don't just line

848.16 --> 852.639
up okay this is inside the box everybody

850.72 --> 854.5600000000001
that does this is inside the box

852.639 --> 856.5600000000001
everybody that doesn't is outside the

854.56 --> 860.399
box

856.56 --> 862.16
based on a philosophical argument

860.399 --> 863.04
i do it on

862.16 --> 865.12
under

863.04 --> 867.12
the guise of behavior

865.12 --> 869.04
and that is universal because everybody

867.12 --> 871.36
deals with behavior everybody deals with

869.04 --> 874.24
their inner struggles trying to overcome

871.36 --> 876.88
bad behavior

874.24 --> 879.279
no matter where ever you stand pretty

876.88 --> 880.56
much philosophically

879.279 --> 883.04
i find that

880.56 --> 885.8389999999999
to be much more honest way of doing

883.04 --> 885.8389999999999
things

889.29 --> 892.419
[Music]

894.88 --> 900.959
no no good servant it's no use you

897.519 --> 900.9590000000001
already declare it yourself

901.04 --> 905.92
do i need to read it do i need to read

903.279 --> 905.92
it out loud

909.519 --> 914.9590000000001
it's a channel for saved christians and

912.88 --> 917.92
you denied his death and then you

914.959 --> 917.92
demanded a wrench

924.72 --> 929.6
yeah i demanded the wrench for my

926.32 --> 932.0790000000001
protection because i was being muzzled

929.6 --> 935.1990000000001
by people that philosophically disagreed

932.079 --> 938.2399999999999
with me even though i was not

935.199 --> 940.56
verbally offending or even directly

938.24 --> 942.0
targeting individuals i wasn't doing

940.56 --> 944.56
that at all

942.0 --> 945.6
only thing i did let's just

944.56 --> 948.88
say

945.6 --> 951.759
oh dear not this again

948.88 --> 952.72
and i just tuned out

951.759 --> 954.9590000000001
i just

952.72 --> 956.72
shared my dissatisfaction like i don't

954.959 --> 958.16
like the chanting like i'm not even

956.72 --> 960.399
gonna stop you

958.16 --> 962.3199999999999
because that's completely useless but i

960.399 --> 963.68
will always be honest about what i feel

962.32 --> 966.5600000000001
about it

963.68 --> 968.959
kind of like george sanford

966.56 --> 970.959
whenever freaking jesus is brought up

968.959 --> 972.0
right very annoying

970.959 --> 975.199
but

972.0 --> 975.199
that's where he stands

975.44 --> 978.8000000000001
and

976.24 --> 981.6
i think he's trying to improve himself

978.8 --> 984.3199999999999
in not constantly spamming that [ __ ] and

981.6 --> 985.759
be extremely inconvenient well so am i

984.32 --> 989.0400000000001
but that doesn't mean that i'm just

985.759 --> 991.279
going to completely not bring it up

989.04 --> 993.4399999999999
because it is a long-standing issue that

991.279 --> 994.8389999999999
i have

993.44 --> 997.36
i'm very

994.839 --> 1000.24
concerned for you

997.36 --> 1003.12
and for others that

1000.24 --> 1006.12
that yeah categorize themselves like

1003.12 --> 1006.12
this

1015.68 --> 1020.3199999999999
yeah that's right i did demand a wrench

1017.6 --> 1022.0790000000001
and i gave you an ultimatum

1020.32 --> 1024.0
and now i'm following through on that

1022.079 --> 1026.8799999999999
ultimatum i'm not going to follow your

1024.0 --> 1026.88
streams anymore

1036.959 --> 1041.28
right you're not the only one by the way

1039.039 --> 1043.36
there's other streams out there

1041.28 --> 1045.439
that just

1043.36 --> 1049.12
they don't respect

1045.439 --> 1049.1200000000001
freedom of expression

1049.44 --> 1053.679
they don't accept criticism and then i

1052.08 --> 1057.6
stop going there

1053.679 --> 1061.5590000000002
because i don't feel welcome anymore

1057.6 --> 1061.559
and i don't want to be there

1074.4 --> 1078.64
i know it's not good servant who tied me

1076.559 --> 1081.28
out dutch sailor like

1078.64 --> 1082.88
no he would never do that

1081.28 --> 1085.039
and let well if he do that he'd

1082.88 --> 1087.5200000000002
immediately say it i think he has

1085.039 --> 1089.76
actually done that in the past

1087.52 --> 1091.76
for similar reasons

1089.76 --> 1093.84
but then it wasn't as cleared up in my

1091.76 --> 1095.12
mind yet what was wrong about the

1093.84 --> 1098.3999999999999
situation

1095.12 --> 1100.559
now i have a model for this

1098.4 --> 1103.52
like i already know exactly how this is

1100.559 --> 1106.6399999999999
wrong and it is very

1103.52 --> 1109.6
shocking because it is like a world tear

1106.64 --> 1112.0800000000002
the inside out again just like with the

1109.6 --> 1112.08
ballers

1119.76 --> 1124.0
and i will bring it back up as a subject

1122.32 --> 1126.3999999999999
i didn't necessarily want to do that

1124.0 --> 1126.4
today

1129.28 --> 1133.039
but i will i will eventually lay it all

1131.679 --> 1134.4
out

1133.039 --> 1137.4
like i could

1134.4 --> 1137.4
technically

1139.36 --> 1146.039
at some point even right

1141.679 --> 1146.039
draw a schematic of it

1154.799 --> 1158.559
anyway

1155.84 --> 1158.559
let's move on

1161.6 --> 1164.7199999999998
perhaps it's best if everyone says in

1163.919 --> 1167.1200000000001
there

1164.72 --> 1167.1200000000001
right

1168.64 --> 1175.48
oh if echoes is all they wanna hear then

1171.12 --> 1175.4799999999998
yes then they should

1181.28 --> 1183.6
right

1191.6 --> 1195.7199999999998
hello aries curse a man

1225.679 --> 1228.679
right

1256.559 --> 1261.08
hello mom ticks patch

1272.0 --> 1275.0
hmm

1278.159 --> 1281.8400000000001
right so let's see

1282.0 --> 1285.88
what's going on yesterday

1294.0 --> 1300.24
i met you from australia

1297.039 --> 1302.32
was live that was cool

1300.24 --> 1305.32
i missed out on jim bob and watch it

1302.32 --> 1305.32
afterwards

1306.48 --> 1312.0
after show of course

1309.2 --> 1312.0
what's that about

1316.64 --> 1320.3200000000002
completely forgotten

1318.799 --> 1321.84
anyway

1320.32 --> 1323.76
uh

1321.84 --> 1326.3999999999999
yeah brandon's

1323.76 --> 1330.4
brandon's was hilarious

1326.4 --> 1333.2800000000002
like rompus was all over that said some

1330.4 --> 1336.24
really funny things

1333.28 --> 1338.0
like he was convinced that

1336.24 --> 1340.799
what was it again let me

1338.0 --> 1344.12
i posted the quote somewhere

1340.799 --> 1344.12
was it

1349.12 --> 1354.3999999999999
yeah measuring space time is a physical

1351.919 --> 1354.4
process

1354.88 --> 1359.1200000000001
that was like what romper said yesterday

1357.2 --> 1361.8400000000001
over at brandon's and it was really

1359.12 --> 1361.84
funny

1364.4 --> 1368.799
like he's going

1366.08 --> 1373.72
into a hyper drive

1368.799 --> 1373.72
concerning sci-fi these days

1374.159 --> 1376.4
uh

1383.44 --> 1388.96
what's my other i don't have another

1385.36 --> 1391.6
youtube account except for arwinian bear

1388.96 --> 1394.24
montix patch

1391.6 --> 1394.24
you know that

1399.2 --> 1405.28
if it doesn't contain

1401.039 --> 1407.52
beginning to end live streams unedited

1405.28 --> 1409.36
it's not my channel

1407.52 --> 1411.9189999999999
my channels

1409.36 --> 1415.52
pretty much only have

1411.919 --> 1417.3600000000001
my streams unedited i have not edited a

1415.52 --> 1419.9189999999999
single stream

1417.36 --> 1423.36
i have like one

1419.919 --> 1426.0
com self made composed video which is

1423.36 --> 1427.6
very embarrassing during

1426.0 --> 1430.24
four years ago

1427.6 --> 1432.1589999999999
flat cats god so embarrassing but yeah i

1430.24 --> 1434.159
tried

1432.159 --> 1435.8400000000001
it was lame i had no idea what i was

1434.159 --> 1437.8400000000001
doing

1435.84 --> 1440.48
it was kind of funny i guess but it was

1437.84 --> 1443.84
also really stupid and embarrassing

1440.48 --> 1446.24
and that other than that it's just

1443.84 --> 1448.48
live recordings

1446.24 --> 1450.4
nobody talking over it

1448.48 --> 1453.44
no music

1450.4 --> 1454.3200000000002
except for intro and outro

1453.44 --> 1459.8400000000001
that's

1454.32 --> 1459.84
my channel that's how you know it is me

1461.6 --> 1465.84
right and if anybody else out there is

1463.84 --> 1468.72
going to make their own arwyn channel

1465.84 --> 1471.039
and then only have certain episodes on

1468.72 --> 1474.64
there who knows maybe they want to

1471.039 --> 1476.24
emphasize my more radical moments

1474.64 --> 1478.96
that's fine because as long as they

1476.24 --> 1478.96
don't edit it

1479.039 --> 1482.0
just

1480.159 --> 1483.8400000000001
put it there as is

1482.0 --> 1486.48
then that's still just an honest

1483.84 --> 1488.72
reflection

1486.48 --> 1488.72
right

1492.08 --> 1497.279
i don't even know why i addressed that

1493.919 --> 1499.8400000000001
obvious troll in there

1497.279 --> 1502.64
i just i'm so bored

1499.84 --> 1504.8799999999999
the input is so lame the attempt so

1502.64 --> 1506.7990000000002
futile i i don't even want to just

1504.88 --> 1510.4
delete it anymore i just

1506.799 --> 1513.2
want to make it known that

1510.4 --> 1515.6000000000001
it's not working it's so not working i'm

1513.2 --> 1518.0800000000002
not even willing to treat you like a

1515.6 --> 1520.0
troll at this point

1518.08 --> 1523.039
you understand

1520.0 --> 1526.64
it's getting so pathetic

1523.039 --> 1526.64
like i don't have to squish

1526.799 --> 1530.6399999999999
every bug that comes walking past i

1528.96 --> 1531.52
don't just

1530.64 --> 1533.76
let it

1531.52 --> 1533.76
go

1534.96 --> 1538.88
let them dwell in the dirt

1539.84 --> 1543.24
hello backs

1548.24 --> 1553.039
what

1550.159 --> 1553.0390000000002
daniel field

1553.12 --> 1556.9599999999998
you don't even know who rumpus is you

1555.12 --> 1558.7199999999998
gotta be kidding right that that has to

1556.96 --> 1563.159
be sarcastic

1558.72 --> 1563.159
i know you've been around for a while

1572.72 --> 1576.64
but if that was an attack on his

1574.4 --> 1579.1200000000001
character i get it yeah he is a no one

1576.64 --> 1581.5200000000002
technically he's a delusional anti-flat

1579.12 --> 1585.4399999999998
earther

1581.52 --> 1587.6
machination wizard

1585.44 --> 1590.559
but

1587.6 --> 1594.6399999999999
i don't know i guess in this play in a

1590.559 --> 1594.6399999999999
way he is like my favorite villain

1595.12 --> 1598.9189999999999
i can't help it

1608.24 --> 1614.4
the rumpus is a legend

1611.039 --> 1616.799
well he is dude he has a

1614.4 --> 1619.52
a social interaction

1616.799 --> 1623.0
named after him now that is like a

1619.52 --> 1623.0
covert accomplishment

1628.32 --> 1630.559
right

1635.4 --> 1638.459
[Music]

1638.88 --> 1642.24
like

1639.76 --> 1644.32
i think he's probably proud of that he's

1642.24 --> 1646.96
probably proud that we call it

1644.32 --> 1646.96
rhombusing

1648.96 --> 1654.039
because that's yeah rumpus is rumpus

1654.399 --> 1660.279
he is trying to mind control everyone

1656.96 --> 1660.279
all the time

1668.799 --> 1675.6
always changes to a [ __ ] show yeah yeah

1672.08 --> 1678.0
well rompus is very easily like

1675.6 --> 1678.0
pulls

1678.399 --> 1683.799
out of contour yeah you say not out of

1680.159 --> 1683.7990000000002
contortion uh

1684.799 --> 1691.799
pulled into the angry zone

1687.12 --> 1691.799
these days he like his

1696.159 --> 1699.679
i think he's like tiring out from it a

1698.24 --> 1702.32
little

1699.679 --> 1706.24
because he has less patience it's less

1702.32 --> 1706.24
focus he can't maintain it as long

1706.64 --> 1710.5590000000002
then again maybe he still just has

1708.399 --> 1714.4799999999998
exactly the same level as when he

1710.559 --> 1716.48
started out and it's just that

1714.48 --> 1718.64
the resistance he's getting now and

1716.48 --> 1720.3990000000001
people figuring it out is on a much

1718.64 --> 1723.2
higher level and so it's become more

1720.399 --> 1725.039
strainful to uphold the doing the same

1723.2 --> 1727.76
thing as he's always done

1725.039 --> 1727.76
which he has

1730.48 --> 1734.76
all right

1731.44 --> 1734.76
hello mark

1738.559 --> 1742.48
what are you folks talking about we're

1741.039 --> 1745.84
talking about

1742.48 --> 1745.84
figures on the internet

1747.44 --> 1752.159
relating to the flat earth and anti-flat

1750.0 --> 1754.559
earth scene

1752.159 --> 1756.88
that's what we're talking about

1754.559 --> 1756.8799999999999
vex

1763.2 --> 1768.32
got the inspector he's running out of

1764.84 --> 1768.32
ideas well

1768.72 --> 1773.039
he's already applied all the ideas he

1771.36 --> 1775.4399999999998
was very early with a lot of the

1773.039 --> 1777.84
applications machinations

1775.44 --> 1781.279
to conjure them forth to kind of stay

1777.84 --> 1783.279
ahead of the curve the learning curve

1781.279 --> 1785.52
and that worked really well for him he

1783.279 --> 1787.76
was a bit like a wizard in the beginning

1785.52 --> 1789.2
he really was and i was like

1787.76 --> 1790.399
like

1789.2 --> 1792.559
wow

1790.399 --> 1794.399
he actually understands that but he

1792.559 --> 1796.799
doesn't understand it at the same time

1794.399 --> 1799.84
like he has a foresight that at the same

1796.799 --> 1802.6399999999999
time he's blinded

1799.84 --> 1804.72
to himself in the process and he

1802.64 --> 1808.039
fascinated me a lot

1804.72 --> 1808.039
years ago

1809.279 --> 1812.08
that's amazing

1815.2 --> 1818.0
but yeah he's

1818.64 --> 1822.3200000000002
he's kind of running out

1820.64 --> 1824.159
running out of maneuvering room but he's

1822.32 --> 1826.799
still just he is

1824.159 --> 1828.7990000000002
he has been perfecting

1826.799 --> 1831.36
the art of double speak

1828.799 --> 1832.6399999999999
and of subtle double speak

1831.36 --> 1836.039
and

1832.64 --> 1836.039
so yeah

1839.36 --> 1843.12
he still can't do and he doesn't seem to

1841.52 --> 1844.799
be able to do anything to stop the

1843.12 --> 1847.6789999999999
stuttering though when you really hold

1844.799 --> 1849.44
his toes to the fire that still happens

1847.679 --> 1851.6000000000001
but that's probably because at that

1849.44 --> 1852.559
point like they really go on tilt and

1851.6 --> 1855.6789999999999
they just

1852.559 --> 1855.6789999999999
they lose control

1859.44 --> 1865.8400000000001
stay ahead of the curve pun intended

1862.64 --> 1865.8400000000001
yeah sure

1866.08 --> 1870.1589999999999
but i did emphasize learning curve

1872.399 --> 1876.1589999999999
and that's not a pun that's

1874.159 --> 1879.8400000000001
literally what was

1876.159 --> 1879.8400000000001
happening at the time

1881.12 --> 1886.6399999999999
i mean he freaking figured out

1883.2 --> 1886.64
terrestrial refraction

1887.44 --> 1890.24
very early

1890.72 --> 1893.919
like he

1891.84 --> 1897.6789999999999
started to he wasn't the one to

1893.919 --> 1899.039
effectively introduce all that

1897.679 --> 1903.48
i understand

1899.039 --> 1903.48
he just maneuvered it in there

1910.159 --> 1914.72
he does get very triggered over nothing

1912.159 --> 1917.1200000000001
or lately yeah but that's that's logical

1914.72 --> 1919.519
because that's exit strategy

1917.12 --> 1920.8799999999999
you know when you get triggered

1919.519 --> 1922.159
that means

1920.88 --> 1924.3990000000001
he just

1922.159 --> 1926.159
he doesn't know how to maintain his act

1924.399 --> 1929.039
anymore how he can

1926.159 --> 1931.1200000000001
save face in the face of whatever is put

1929.039 --> 1934.72
on the table in front of him so then he

1931.12 --> 1937.1999999999998
just gets all ruckusy

1934.72 --> 1940.0
and noisy until everybody's all

1937.2 --> 1943.76
distracted and he can try again

1940.0 --> 1943.76
or until somebody kicks him out

1945.84 --> 1950.08
maybe he's waking up no

1948.399 --> 1951.6789999999999
no i don't think rumpus is ever gonna

1950.08 --> 1955.279
wake up

1951.679 --> 1958.0800000000002
i think he's very locked in

1955.279 --> 1958.08
in what he's doing

1959.44 --> 1965.0800000000002
hello moonshadow

1961.279 --> 1965.08
tasmanian truther

1982.24 --> 1986.48
mechanized wizard no no

1984.48 --> 1987.76
it's not mechanized it's machination

1986.48 --> 1991.3600000000001
wizards

1987.76 --> 1994.24
they're not robot they well

1991.36 --> 1998.1589999999999
their mythology

1994.24 --> 1998.159
their methods are mechanized

2000.559 --> 2006.24
but what really makes them wizards is

2003.2 --> 2007.1200000000001
that they build machinations knowingly

2006.24 --> 2010.559
yeah

2007.12 --> 2010.559
knowing false architecture

2011.2 --> 2014.96
that's the real wizardry

2015.279 --> 2020.48
that's where they basically also venture

2018.0 --> 2025.039
out of the innocence

2020.48 --> 2028.08
and into the just forging lies territory

2025.039 --> 2028.08
it's very risky

2028.88 --> 2032.2
for the spirit

2033.84 --> 2038.72
especially if the if you start to

2035.84 --> 2041.72
believe in your own machination

2038.72 --> 2041.72
anyway

2050.079 --> 2053.079
uh

2063.04 --> 2066.44
was it again

2080.079 --> 2083.079
okay

2096.399 --> 2099.92
right anyway

2097.92 --> 2101.359
i don't really want to

2099.92 --> 2103.92
spend

2101.359 --> 2106.64
half a hangout talking about rumpus a

2103.92 --> 2110.32
bit of a waste of time

2106.64 --> 2110.3199999999997
what else is going on out there

2111.119 --> 2117.079
australia is seeing some serious action

2113.599 --> 2117.079
in many ways

2118.64 --> 2122.64
there's some political stuff going on

2120.64 --> 2125.64
too weird

2122.64 --> 2125.64
creepy

2136.72 --> 2140.56
i think

2138.24 --> 2142.7999999999997
if i didn't yeah

2140.56 --> 2144.64
might be misinterpreting it slightly but

2142.8 --> 2147.3590000000004
i think like that

2144.64 --> 2147.359
china kind of

2148.72 --> 2153.52
threatened them

2150.48 --> 2156.2400000000002
or rather warned them about becoming

2153.52 --> 2159.599
like a nuclear war target

2156.24 --> 2162.4799999999996
like on top of everything else

2159.599 --> 2163.76
top of both

2162.48 --> 2166.88
riots

2163.76 --> 2166.88
serious riots

2170.079 --> 2177.52
i really go hard at it so yeah

2174.079 --> 2177.52
that's been standing out to me

2183.599 --> 2187.0
hello m

2194.16 --> 2198.839
is anybody else picked up on that

2239.04 --> 2242.04
uh

2252.4 --> 2257.2400000000002
i'll see kosak never heard of that

2263.44 --> 2267.599
all right yeah by the way

2265.68 --> 2269.5989999999997
in general

2267.599 --> 2271.6800000000003
dude

2269.599 --> 2274.079
there's so many people out there doing

2271.68 --> 2276.16
streams and doing a thing

2274.079 --> 2278.32
and a lot of it is actually not bad at

2276.16 --> 2278.3199999999997
all

2278.8 --> 2284.599
it's just that these guys are starting

2280.72 --> 2284.5989999999997
to become a little overfilled

2285.68 --> 2289.5989999999997
like i can't watch all that

2290.56 --> 2293.7599999999998
like i'm even having trouble sometimes

2292.88 --> 2295.04
like

2293.76 --> 2297.2000000000003
keeping

2295.04 --> 2299.839
or catching up with owen benjamin's

2297.2 --> 2299.839
dreams

2302.16 --> 2304.48
come on

2310.8 --> 2316.48
the funeral director's video

2313.28 --> 2316.48
yeah yeah i did see that

2322.079 --> 2326.5600000000004
it's scary yeah well i'm not

2324.56 --> 2327.839
i'm not gonna be scared anymore about

2326.56 --> 2330.0
anything

2327.839 --> 2335.0
it comes from anywhere

2330.0 --> 2335.0
i'm just not gonna be part of it

2341.839 --> 2345.52
like

2343.04 --> 2348.56
the fears just gotta end

2345.52 --> 2348.56
from all sides

2349.28 --> 2357.2000000000003
and not by censorship but just by people

2352.72 --> 2357.2
realizing this is counterproductive

2360.48 --> 2364.56
if you fear it it could get to you

2366.16 --> 2372.3999999999996
so this idea of oh there's this

2369.28 --> 2374.079
v and laboratory in it

2372.4 --> 2377.92
ah

2374.079 --> 2380.32
god and alex jones was like really

2377.92 --> 2385.44
pushing that again like seriously oh

2380.32 --> 2385.44
this is the most alarming thing ever

2385.839 --> 2388.0789999999997
oh

2391.44 --> 2395.2000000000003
all reinforcement it's all reafforded

2394.0 --> 2397.76
like i

2395.2 --> 2399.9199999999996
he has to know he's doing that

2397.76 --> 2401.8390000000004
like alex has to realize that that is

2399.92 --> 2406.079
what he's doing at this point

2401.839 --> 2409.68
and that might be part of a an agenda

2406.079 --> 2409.6800000000003
like a counter agenda

2409.76 --> 2414.2400000000002
right some kind of a legal route

2414.319 --> 2422.48
a reinforcement of an opinion within how

2418.319 --> 2422.48
it's going to be stopped whatever but

2423.04 --> 2428.96
like i stand my ground in my approach

2426.16 --> 2432.319
and say like no it's it's 100

2428.96 --> 2432.319
psychological warfare

2432.56 --> 2439.52
c and v are hundred percent that like

2435.839 --> 2441.92
the v is basically biological warfare

2439.52 --> 2444.319
but the c

2441.92 --> 2447.28
100 psychological

2444.319 --> 2450.319
like there is nothing nothing nothing

2447.28 --> 2451.52
absolutely nothing

2450.319 --> 2455.119
like

2451.52 --> 2455.119
the model is wrong

2455.92 --> 2458.079
like

2456.72 --> 2461.52
not even

2458.079 --> 2464.079
the statistical conclu no the entire

2461.52 --> 2467.04
model is wrong

2464.079 --> 2468.8
it's a virtual thing

2467.04 --> 2472.8
it doesn't exist like that that's not

2468.8 --> 2472.8
how it works it never did

2477.92 --> 2482.7200000000003
i'm not afraid of fees like at all

2482.96 --> 2488.48
i'm much more afraid of

2486.16 --> 2490.7999999999997
energy weakness

2488.48 --> 2492.0
of

2490.8 --> 2495.28
well

2492.0 --> 2498.0
fear related thoughts that would weaken

2495.28 --> 2501.0400000000004
you in a moment right

2498.0 --> 2502.56
that's how diseases really can get to

2501.04 --> 2504.8
you

2502.56 --> 2507.2
like especially under toxic conditions

2504.8 --> 2510.7200000000003
it's demoralization and i've even called

2507.2 --> 2512.96
that like over a year ago

2510.72 --> 2515.1189999999997
the main weapon is demoralization that's

2512.96 --> 2516.4
what a psychological warfare operation

2515.119 --> 2519.6800000000003
is

2516.4 --> 2519.6800000000003
you planned ideas

2520.16 --> 2525.68
whatever background works to back them

2522.88 --> 2526.88
up some kind of body of science to back

2525.68 --> 2528.24
it up

2526.88 --> 2529.2000000000003
somehow

2528.24 --> 2532.0
and then

2529.2 --> 2533.52
if people feel it's too much for them to

2532.0 --> 2536.72
contain it all

2533.52 --> 2540.319
they will just trust the specialists and

2536.72 --> 2542.24
now they are enchanted by that spell

2540.319 --> 2543.72
and then they

2542.24 --> 2546.64
well they have to face the

2543.72 --> 2548.319
demoralization from believing the things

2546.64 --> 2550.56
associated

2548.319 --> 2553.44
right they have to choose every time

2550.56 --> 2553.44
do i believe this

2555.04 --> 2558.96
and every time you do

2556.72 --> 2560.8799999999997
you get punished by it

2558.96 --> 2562.48
with fear

2560.88 --> 2565.44
it's going to change your behavior

2562.48 --> 2568.4
you're going to be end up in a more

2565.44 --> 2569.92
demoralized state

2568.4 --> 2572.56
less sociable

2569.92 --> 2572.56
etc

2572.88 --> 2577.76
more desperate perhaps even for some

2575.68 --> 2579.359
so it's a psychological warfare

2577.76 --> 2584.079
operation that is

2579.359 --> 2586.0789999999997
purely sowing demoralization to weaken

2584.079 --> 2587.119
the person's condition

2586.079 --> 2590.079
which

2587.119 --> 2594.8
will typically result especially if the

2590.079 --> 2594.8
strain is very high in sickness

2596.88 --> 2602.44
because of the burden from the mind on

2599.28 --> 2602.44
the body

2606.4 --> 2609.8
so yeah

2615.66 --> 2619.56
[Music]

2622.88 --> 2627.6800000000003
instead of spell call it hex no

2626.24 --> 2630.0789999999997
no i will not

2627.68 --> 2633.9199999999996
because it is a spell you know why

2630.079 --> 2636.2400000000002
because it is about the words it's word

2633.92 --> 2637.92
magic spell casting

2636.24 --> 2640.4799999999996
a hex

2637.92 --> 2640.48
it's different

2641.28 --> 2645.0
that's something else

2653.04 --> 2656.56
right

2654.24 --> 2658.56
maybe maybe it is not

2656.56 --> 2661.2799999999997
different maybe it is just a different

2658.56 --> 2663.52
field of approach

2661.28 --> 2668.3190000000004
but i kind of in my mind tend to divide

2663.52 --> 2668.319
them up say hex falls more under a curse

2668.4 --> 2672.96
a curse doesn't really give you anything

2670.64 --> 2675.359
it only weakens you until you serve yeah

2672.96 --> 2677.599
you figure it out you dispel it

2675.359 --> 2679.2799999999997
but a spell

2677.599 --> 2681.04
is like

2679.28 --> 2683.599
a delusion

2681.04 --> 2685.2799999999997
you can buy into

2683.599 --> 2689.56
and still

2685.28 --> 2689.5600000000004
get something out of it though

2693.44 --> 2697.76
i i don't know

2695.92 --> 2700.76
maybe there isn't really much of a

2697.76 --> 2700.76
difference

2710.64 --> 2717.56
i was thought of hexes more to be

2713.68 --> 2717.56
non-verbal magic

2720.079 --> 2726.7200000000003
but maybe i'm wrong

2722.4 --> 2726.7200000000003
i'm not exactly a kabala expert

2727.119 --> 2732.28
although i'm very well aware of its

2729.28 --> 2732.28
existence

2746.56 --> 2750.0789999999997
right

2747.68 --> 2752.3999999999996
yes well pj crosstank it's really funny

2750.079 --> 2754.0
the well spelled out

2752.4 --> 2757.839
because

2754.0 --> 2761.28
by not being anxious or worrying

2757.839 --> 2763.52
about things that are like very unlikely

2761.28 --> 2765.52
to be true

2763.52 --> 2768.56
you can actually

2765.52 --> 2770.96
give an example for others that are kind

2768.56 --> 2772.56
of desperately seeking for a way out of

2770.96 --> 2776.48
the nightmare

2772.56 --> 2777.599
you can they can see it and feel it off

2776.48 --> 2780.079
you

2777.599 --> 2782.88
that gives them a moment of

2780.079 --> 2785.119
opportunity to feel the difference

2782.88 --> 2786.96
and if they

2785.119 --> 2789.6800000000003
have been looking for that they might

2786.96 --> 2791.599
use it to actually

2789.68 --> 2792.48
step out of it

2791.599 --> 2796.2400000000002
right

2792.48 --> 2797.359
usually it's you want a safe haven

2796.24 --> 2799.52
where you

2797.359 --> 2801.2799999999997
where it's easier to let go of the

2799.52 --> 2802.72
thoughts because there's other thoughts

2801.28 --> 2805.3590000000004
going about

2802.72 --> 2808.48
that you can use to replace it if you

2805.359 --> 2810.0
need a safe haven from that spell

2808.48 --> 2812.8
from that

2810.0 --> 2814.64
fear-inducing spell

2812.8 --> 2816.5600000000004
so by being

2814.64 --> 2818.7999999999997
fearless

2816.56 --> 2822.16
seeing through the spell and just not

2818.8 --> 2822.1600000000003
being demoralized and

2823.28 --> 2829.52
like energy wise physically showing an

2826.16 --> 2830.48
example of how to

2829.52 --> 2832.4
live

2830.48 --> 2835.04
having it purged

2832.4 --> 2836.4
you give those that have not been able

2835.04 --> 2839.92
to step out

2836.4 --> 2842.2400000000002
a glimpse of what it's like to not

2839.92 --> 2844.48
be caught up in the spell and to give

2842.24 --> 2846.0789999999997
them the opportunity to realize

2844.48 --> 2847.52
that they could

2846.079 --> 2849.119
on it they don't even have to

2847.52 --> 2850.88
consciously be able to reach it but they

2849.119 --> 2852.6400000000003
could on an intuitive level on a

2850.88 --> 2856.1600000000003
visceral level

2852.64 --> 2859.839
almost primal can feel it like

2856.16 --> 2859.839
i could get out of it

2860.64 --> 2864.72
right

2862.079 --> 2866.96
and in that way it it follows into the

2864.72 --> 2869.52
methodology

2866.96 --> 2871.599
of the yeah of

2869.52 --> 2874.8
of jesus

2871.599 --> 2876.6400000000003
right being the example lifting them out

2874.8 --> 2879.04
giving them the opportunity to choose

2876.64 --> 2880.96
the right thing

2879.04 --> 2882.5589999999997
show them fearlessness

2880.96 --> 2884.319
but not

2882.559 --> 2885.44
hostility not

2884.319 --> 2887.7599999999998
is it

2885.44 --> 2889.92
animosity

2887.76 --> 2892.0
i do not show them animosity for their

2889.92 --> 2894.0
weakness

2892.0 --> 2896.0
pity them

2894.0 --> 2898.64
but do not mock them

2896.0 --> 2901.68
and then you can just show like you can

2898.64 --> 2904.4
be this that's what jesus was trying to

2901.68 --> 2908.64
do it's a method it's his method

2904.4 --> 2912.0
this glorious glorious jesus method

2908.64 --> 2912.0
the purest of pure

2912.24 --> 2919.1189999999997
his actions what he was doing what he

2915.119 --> 2921.119
stood for the methods the path

2919.119 --> 2924.0
the the challenge and burden you would

2921.119 --> 2926.88
have to face and overcome

2924.0 --> 2930.64
and not just be oh poor me i'm so

2926.88 --> 2930.6400000000003
burdened by all this no no

2931.839 --> 2935.52
basically take a burden

2934.559 --> 2938.0
and then

2935.52 --> 2941.48
overcome the burden muscle it muscle it

2938.0 --> 2941.48
through the test

2943.04 --> 2946.88
that's right jesus was the best of us

2945.599 --> 2949.119
indeed

2946.88 --> 2950.8
i love that i've that i've conjured that

2949.119 --> 2953.119
saying

2950.8 --> 2954.96
i love it i'm very happy that i did i

2953.119 --> 2957.28
don't even i'm not even proud of it it's

2954.96 --> 2960.559
just such a good saying

2957.28 --> 2960.559
jesus was the best of us

2966.72 --> 2970.7999999999997
what a time

2968.0 --> 2972.96
to do that so long ago to suddenly

2970.8 --> 2977.04
reveal that

2972.96 --> 2978.8
and it still echoes on it's amazing

2977.04 --> 2981.2
what a miracle

2978.8 --> 2984.0
his existence his method his teachings

2981.2 --> 2987.5589999999997
what a miracle it is that god has given

2984.0 --> 2987.559
us through creation

3011.76 --> 3016.0
right yes aries cursed men i know

3023.52 --> 3030.16
i i guess i have a uh lingual

3027.76 --> 3032.88
predisposition against the word

3030.16 --> 3034.72
because the word hex

3032.88 --> 3039.119
in dutch

3034.72 --> 3040.3999999999996
literally tran translates to which

3039.119 --> 3043.44
and i don't

3040.4 --> 3043.44
like that i don't

3046.72 --> 3053.5989999999997
right it goes the

3050.0 --> 3057.8
the root of all which is in witchcraft

3053.599 --> 3057.8
is it's all just evil

3071.04 --> 3076.44
it's all just choices it's choices and

3073.44 --> 3076.44
consequences

3094.24 --> 3099.7599999999998
jesus gave us a way out to start fresh

3097.76 --> 3102.079
yeah through his methods

3099.76 --> 3104.4
through his teachings

3102.079 --> 3104.4
through

3105.119 --> 3108.4
you

3106.0 --> 3110.72
listening to what he says

3108.4 --> 3111.839
and also listening to his lessons about

3110.72 --> 3114.64
hey

3111.839 --> 3117.359
don't listen to others

3114.64 --> 3120.96
especially what they say about me

3117.359 --> 3123.04
or what they do that contradicts me

3120.96 --> 3125.119
but they do not know what they do they

3123.04 --> 3128.24
think they're doing the right thing just

3125.119 --> 3129.04
don't get caught up in their delusion

3128.24 --> 3130.3999999999996
like

3129.04 --> 3132.88
everyone

3130.4 --> 3136.079
no exception

3132.88 --> 3138.319
if you stand high on that

3136.079 --> 3140.1600000000003
that peak this that i'm now just doing

3138.319 --> 3143.04
my own thing if you stand high not not

3140.16 --> 3145.2
paraphrasing anymore if you stand high

3143.04 --> 3148.5589999999997
on the peak very bright very far then

3145.2 --> 3148.5589999999997
everybody can see you and

3149.28 --> 3155.119
they will feel like

3151.04 --> 3155.119
he stands above me i don't like that

3156.48 --> 3160.8
even though they might have helped you

3158.559 --> 3160.8
there

3162.8 --> 3168.079
but it's just that

3164.4 --> 3171.2000000000003
nobody likes to be likes to feel

3168.079 --> 3174.7200000000003
outdone by somebody else

3171.2 --> 3176.96
makes you feel inferior and that the ego

3174.72 --> 3180.72
does not like that and will use that as

3176.96 --> 3182.8
an excuse to seduce you into bad

3180.72 --> 3184.72
behavior

3182.8 --> 3187.92
and then you become

3184.72 --> 3189.52
the automated shadow opposition

3187.92 --> 3191.119
to

3189.52 --> 3194.72
that person

3191.119 --> 3197.599
that is that is standing that high

3194.72 --> 3200.9599999999996
right the higher you ascend the more

3197.599 --> 3203.04
everybody will oppose you

3200.96 --> 3205.52
suddenly they will say oh now he's gone

3203.04 --> 3205.52
too far

3206.96 --> 3214.88
right this far and no further

3211.68 --> 3217.1189999999997
or what if you really had good reasons

3214.88 --> 3219.04
and explanations

3217.119 --> 3220.559
as to why you shouldn't

3219.04 --> 3222.88
have

3220.559 --> 3225.92
that far and no further

3222.88 --> 3228.6400000000003
maybe the entire approach was

3225.92 --> 3230.8
slightly incorrect making you to come to

3228.64 --> 3232.8799999999997
that conclusion this far and no further

3230.8 --> 3237.0
maybe that was a trap

3232.88 --> 3237.0
to prevent further ascension

3248.18 --> 3251.3399999999997
[Music]

3252.24 --> 3255.7599999999998
no

3253.04 --> 3258.72
no good servant

3255.76 --> 3258.7200000000003
no sacrifice

3261.28 --> 3267.2000000000003
i do not condone

3263.28 --> 3267.2000000000003
worshipping of human sacrifice

3268.64 --> 3275.04
and i find the prospect of diety

3272.319 --> 3278.04
incarnation sacrifice absolutely

3275.04 --> 3278.04
preposterous

3282.319 --> 3286.72
right

3283.359 --> 3288.24
but we can definitely prove

3286.72 --> 3290.8799999999997
the other things

3288.24 --> 3293.839
teachings and words to be effective

3290.88 --> 3296.079
still to this day

3293.839 --> 3299.839
we have evidence for that

3296.079 --> 3301.6800000000003
very blatant evidence for that

3299.839 --> 3303.92
yeah that other part

3301.68 --> 3303.9199999999996
no

3304.0 --> 3307.92
not at all

3305.68 --> 3311.0789999999997
it conflicts with everything everything

3307.92 --> 3311.079
he taught

3333.52 --> 3337.52
freemasons and witches take similar

3336.079 --> 3341.4
oaths

3337.52 --> 3341.4
advance a degree

3348.64 --> 3351.359
that's funny

3352.48 --> 3356.16
well yeah well what oath are you gonna

3354.72 --> 3358.0
take

3356.16 --> 3361.799
what contract are you gonna bind

3358.0 --> 3361.799
yourself to you know

3385.76 --> 3388.6400000000003
yeah

3386.72 --> 3390.799
well i don't need

3388.64 --> 3394.24
i don't need faith

3390.799 --> 3396.4
i don't need faith to justify

3394.24 --> 3399.68
the necessity of believing in human

3396.4 --> 3399.6800000000003
sacrifice good servant

3401.92 --> 3406.2400000000002
i think that's a straw man i think

3403.839 --> 3409.7599999999998
that's projecting

3406.24 --> 3411.4399999999996
that's other people projecting that

3409.76 --> 3414.3190000000004
misusing

3411.44 --> 3416.88
the concept even of faith

3414.319 --> 3419.04
to emphasize that when it is a

3416.88 --> 3422.96
contradiction

3419.04 --> 3422.96
like god does not make you

3424.079 --> 3428.96
embrace contradictions no truth god is

3427.44 --> 3431.04
truth

3428.96 --> 3434.0
so if something

3431.04 --> 3437.2799999999997
is then suggested and demanded of you to

3434.0 --> 3440.079
believe it when it contradicts

3437.28 --> 3443.76
things that are very important

3440.079 --> 3443.76
then that cannot be god

3444.559 --> 3448.48
can't be true it's a contradiction right

3447.2 --> 3451.04
it's just like a second law of

3448.48 --> 3453.2
thermodynamics violation like yeah that

3451.04 --> 3456.0
contradicts the physical reality it

3453.2 --> 3459.1189999999997
doesn't work like that

3456.0 --> 3460.88
there's a law from god

3459.119 --> 3463.92
then

3460.88 --> 3467.04
that's not just like a king on a throne

3463.92 --> 3469.28
making a temporary man's law

3467.04 --> 3471.359
that is then law and then oh the king is

3469.28 --> 3473.44
toppled and another king and he undoes

3471.359 --> 3475.04
the law right or god's laws don't work

3473.44 --> 3476.799
like that

3475.04 --> 3478.72
god's laws

3476.799 --> 3481.04
are like natural law

3478.72 --> 3485.0
part of the design except

3481.04 --> 3485.0
it concerns the spirit

3488.079 --> 3492.1600000000003
so if you then start to convince

3490.4 --> 3495.04
yourself that you have to believe in

3492.16 --> 3496.8799999999997
something that contradicts

3495.04 --> 3499.2
god's law

3496.88 --> 3499.2000000000003
then

3500.16 --> 3506.72
i don't know what i have to tell you

3503.599 --> 3506.7200000000003
to make you see this

3514.72 --> 3518.3999999999996
i have faith in god's design i have

3517.28 --> 3521.92
faith

3518.4 --> 3523.52
in divine cohesion i have faith

3521.92 --> 3525.839
in

3523.52 --> 3529.119
the this the ability to distinguish

3525.839 --> 3529.119
truth from lies

3529.68 --> 3532.799
that is my faith

3532.96 --> 3537.839
i have faith in the methods because

3535.04 --> 3540.4
those are what i named are methods

3537.839 --> 3542.88
it's not a riddle

3540.4 --> 3545.359
these are spirit tools ways of doing

3542.88 --> 3548.1600000000003
things that's where my faith is i have

3545.359 --> 3550.88
faith in the tools that i use

3548.16 --> 3553.2799999999997
that i think i pretty much got from

3550.88 --> 3553.28
jesus

3555.119 --> 3559.359
right

3557.28 --> 3563.119
these tools are gonna last

3559.359 --> 3566.24
a riddle that contradicts god's law

3563.119 --> 3566.2400000000002
is not gonna last

3566.319 --> 3572.68
because

3567.44 --> 3572.68
it can't it's contradiction to god's law

3610.559 --> 3614.3590000000004
faith is confidence

3623.28 --> 3626.48
i

3624.4 --> 3628.079
first had i can't really say that's an

3626.48 --> 3630.4
incorrect statement there one for the

3628.079 --> 3630.4
unit

3636.319 --> 3642.319
but yeah you can fake confidence you can

3638.88 --> 3644.88
dilute yourself

3642.319 --> 3646.799
becomes bluster right somewhat there is

3644.88 --> 3648.7200000000003
such a thing as overconfidence right

3646.799 --> 3650.72
what is overconfidence

3648.72 --> 3651.9199999999996
it's when you have confidence is in

3650.72 --> 3653.7599999999998
things

3651.92 --> 3656.799
that you don't understand

3653.76 --> 3659.44
and then you act erratically

3656.799 --> 3662.079
because of it you go places where you're

3659.44 --> 3665.319
not actually prepared for it because you

3662.079 --> 3665.319
were overconfident

3672.0 --> 3676.16
because you believed in things

3676.64 --> 3680.0789999999997
without

3677.839 --> 3682.319
backing it up

3680.079 --> 3685.8390000000004
with earthly grip with

3682.319 --> 3685.839
grip through your mind

3686.48 --> 3690.88
understanding knowing

3688.559 --> 3694.48
you didn't have the knowledge the grip

3690.88 --> 3695.92
required to actually back up that level

3694.48 --> 3699.04
of confidence and that's why it's

3695.92 --> 3701.92
overconfident it makes you buckle

3699.04 --> 3701.92
it's not effective

3710.48 --> 3713.839
tasmanian truth i don't care

3715.039 --> 3719.3590000000004
i want you

3716.96 --> 3723.839
to stop

3719.359 --> 3728.96
human sacrifice worship in my chat it's

3723.839 --> 3728.96
it's really starting to piss me off

3731.76 --> 3737.3590000000004
i mean holy [ __ ] man if if christians

3734.96 --> 3740.0
were like this

3737.359 --> 3743.2799999999997
it meant evil times

3740.0 --> 3745.2
right when islam was blooming

3743.28 --> 3749.28
holy [ __ ]

3745.2 --> 3751.359
must that have been freaking annoying

3749.28 --> 3752.6400000000003
to to to the

3751.359 --> 3755.92
like the

3752.64 --> 3760.16
the fresh islam priests like the ones

3755.92 --> 3760.16
that are really doing their best and

3760.559 --> 3764.4
well

3761.44 --> 3768.48
figuring out reality holy [ __ ] must have

3764.4 --> 3771.92
been annoying like oh look at these

3768.48 --> 3773.52
crazy people that literally believe in a

3771.92 --> 3777.359
god

3773.52 --> 3780.4
that like is a human sacrifice

3777.359 --> 3780.4
that's insane

3780.559 --> 3785.6800000000003
right if that is what you believe

3783.119 --> 3788.0
if that is the thing that you will start

3785.68 --> 3790.0
chanting yelling when you are become

3788.0 --> 3791.76
afraid when you're threatened is that

3790.0 --> 3793.44
what you're gonna start you you don't

3791.76 --> 3796.079
person you know

3793.44 --> 3799.2000000000003
that's disgusting

3796.079 --> 3800.6400000000003
why don't you instead in your moment

3799.2 --> 3803.4399999999996
of testing

3800.64 --> 3805.5989999999997
recite his words

3803.44 --> 3807.119
his words

3805.599 --> 3808.48
his knowledge

3807.119 --> 3810.319
his power

3808.48 --> 3813.599
of jesus

3810.319 --> 3816.64
instead of chanting i died he was

3813.599 --> 3818.88
he was violently murdered

3816.64 --> 3822.2799999999997
for my safety

3818.88 --> 3822.28
it's preposterous

3835.839 --> 3841.2799999999997
or he just survived and he's still alive

3838.64 --> 3841.2799999999997
good servant

3841.68 --> 3846.96
he is alive yeah yeah

3844.88 --> 3849.44
i'm i'm okay with that i think he

3846.96 --> 3852.48
survived it

3849.44 --> 3855.68
right he never said he is gonna die

3852.48 --> 3858.4
i never he never said and i quote

3855.68 --> 3859.1189999999997
you can find me you can find it

3858.4 --> 3860.4
me

3859.119 --> 3862.7200000000003
not

3860.4 --> 3865.2000000000003
this thing i'm gonna say you might find

3862.72 --> 3868.24
it who knows why don't you try it out

3865.2 --> 3870.8799999999997
i am going to die

3868.24 --> 3873.9199999999996
where did he say that literally that

3870.88 --> 3874.88
literally that where did he say it

3873.92 --> 3876.88
oh

3874.88 --> 3878.6400000000003
he didn't oh

3876.88 --> 3880.559
parable speaking

3878.64 --> 3882.48
more teachings

3880.559 --> 3885.119
distracting away from it why would that

3882.48 --> 3887.599
be why wouldn't he just straight out

3885.119 --> 3890.1600000000003
speak the truth right isn't truth like

3887.599 --> 3891.6800000000003
the most powerful thing

3890.16 --> 3892.48
no

3891.68 --> 3896.16
yeah

3892.48 --> 3899.039
i think he did speak the truth by not

3896.16 --> 3901.92
saying i'm gonna die

3899.039 --> 3901.92
i'm gonna be killed

3906.559 --> 3913.079
so yeah

3909.119 --> 3913.079
i'll be right back in two minutes

3997.839 --> 4000.839
so

4019.28 --> 4022.4
you have confidence in jesus's

4021.119 --> 4024.4
resurrection

4022.4 --> 4025.52
but not the bloods hey

4024.4 --> 4028.0
but that's

4025.52 --> 4029.92
that's already so much better for the

4028.0 --> 4030.96
unit one for the unit

4029.92 --> 4032.88
because

4030.96 --> 4034.799
here's the thing

4032.88 --> 4038.4
i cannot

4034.799 --> 4042.4
absolutely exclude that he died

4038.4 --> 4042.4
i cannot exclude it i'm just saying

4043.039 --> 4046.48
he never said he would

4047.44 --> 4051.92
and

4048.799 --> 4055.0389999999998
i believe he had the power

4051.92 --> 4057.119
to basically on a divine level

4055.039 --> 4060.079
fake his own death

4057.119 --> 4060.079
and it's not a shame

4061.039 --> 4066.88
it was a miracle that he if he survived

4064.0 --> 4068.559
it and i think he could have it was a

4066.88 --> 4071.119
miracle

4068.559 --> 4073.3590000000004
right and then you get like oh but yeah

4071.119 --> 4075.6800000000003
what is it then oh he survived it that's

4073.359 --> 4077.92
a miracle or he died and resurrected

4075.68 --> 4080.0789999999997
that's a miracle and then yeah

4077.92 --> 4083.039
hey if it for some reason is more

4080.079 --> 4083.039
convenient

4083.2 --> 4088.0
to like make him into a martyr and then

4085.68 --> 4089.7599999999998
that ingrained that in your mind control

4088.0 --> 4092.079
religion

4089.76 --> 4094.3190000000004
yeah then who cares it's just a detail

4092.079 --> 4097.279
oh yeah maybe it survived it but yeah

4094.319 --> 4100.4
but everybody in the world

4097.279 --> 4102.799000000001
for thousands of years are gonna chant

4100.4 --> 4104.4
he died for your sins he died for your

4102.799 --> 4106.239
sins yeah yeah

4104.4 --> 4108.239
i'm sure jesus thought that was just

4106.239 --> 4109.919999999999
lovely

4108.239 --> 4114.5199999999995
and i'm being sarcastic now and i

4109.92 --> 4114.52
shouldn't not in relation to jesus

4126.51 --> 4129.569
[Music]

4131.12 --> 4134.159
jesus trickster

4136.88 --> 4140.719
maybe

4137.92 --> 4140.719
a survivor

4141.359 --> 4146.04
a magnificent healer

4146.88 --> 4152.0
and hey what

4148.64 --> 4152.0
how what would you have done

4155.279 --> 4161.2390000000005
if you could

4156.88 --> 4161.2390000000005
somehow survive through it

4162.159 --> 4165.44
then

4163.359 --> 4167.4400000000005
yeah you wouldn't lie

4165.44 --> 4170.5599999999995
about it right you're not going to say

4167.44 --> 4172.639999999999
no no i'm going to die

4170.56 --> 4175.04
and then not actually die

4172.64 --> 4177.359
right you wouldn't do that if you were

4175.04 --> 4179.44
basically trying to be the perfect

4177.359 --> 4181.04
frequency of truth in god

4179.44 --> 4182.4
but you couldn't it would break

4181.04 --> 4184.56
everything

4182.4 --> 4186.839
that would be the failing of the test

4184.56 --> 4188.799
the real

4186.839 --> 4191.759
test so

4188.799 --> 4191.759
trickster well

4193.199 --> 4196.919999999999
in a sense yes

4206.48 --> 4210.48
but yeah what are you gonna do when

4208.0 --> 4212.88
everybody's getting all

4210.48 --> 4214.4
emotionally obsessed and out of their

4212.88 --> 4217.28
minds

4214.4 --> 4219.759999999999
what if some yeah

4217.28 --> 4222.0
if the freaking roman empire came after

4219.76 --> 4222.0
you

4222.96 --> 4228.32
what you're just gonna die or if you

4225.44 --> 4231.839999999999
figured out a way on how to kind of like

4228.32 --> 4231.84
round out the show

4232.159 --> 4234.799999999999
like

4233.36 --> 4236.799999999999
what he did

4234.8 --> 4238.320000000001
his teachings his public teachings his

4236.8 --> 4240.400000000001
declarations

4238.32 --> 4241.5199999999995
everything he did if you had to round

4240.4 --> 4244.96
that out

4241.52 --> 4247.52
well what better than to basically fake

4244.96 --> 4249.28
your own death because that absolutely

4247.52 --> 4251.4400000000005
would guarantee that the roman empire

4249.28 --> 4252.88
would stop

4251.44 --> 4256.599999999999
they would stop

4252.88 --> 4256.6
coming after you

4276.32 --> 4281.84
no you have a good servant there you go

4278.64 --> 4287.0
you if you're so willing to die

4281.84 --> 4287.0
well maybe that's your issue then right

4294.08 --> 4301.76
i mean any mind controller

4297.92 --> 4304.0
would love that right what is a more

4301.76 --> 4306.96
efficient mind control than to make

4304.0 --> 4311.199
everybody recite chance that will make

4306.96 --> 4313.44
them become more willing to die

4311.199 --> 4315.04
for a cause to become completely

4313.44 --> 4319.04
selfless well

4315.04 --> 4319.04
mission successful i'd say

4319.44 --> 4324.879999999999
right

4321.52 --> 4326.64
what is the ultimate mind control

4324.88 --> 4328.2390000000005
being able to send people to their

4326.64 --> 4329.679
deaths

4328.239 --> 4332.5599999999995
voluntarily

4329.679 --> 4335.6
remember conan the barbarian

4332.56 --> 4335.6
the original one

4336.719 --> 4340.2390000000005
come to me come to me

4340.719 --> 4346.2390000000005
that's power

4342.4 --> 4346.239
yeah mind control power

4348.719 --> 4353.6
you feel the pain of others well so do i

4350.96 --> 4353.6
good servant

4354.64 --> 4358.719
not all the time but

4356.4 --> 4362.44
definitely periodically i am very

4358.719 --> 4362.44
sensitive to that

4370.8 --> 4374.88
the roman empire wasn't who was

4375.59 --> 4378.619000000001
[Music]

4382.719 --> 4386.08
right potatoes potatoes

4390.32 --> 4394.92
what is it potatoes potatoes

4399.04 --> 4405.199
right the thing was is that him

4402.88 --> 4406.64
allegedly dying would

4405.199 --> 4410.639999999999
stop

4406.64 --> 4411.4400000000005
the frenzy situation right because

4410.64 --> 4413.52
it

4411.44 --> 4416.159
would have been very reasonable to

4413.52 --> 4417.52
assume that if he had just continued and

4416.159 --> 4419.28
not

4417.52 --> 4421.1990000000005
like

4419.28 --> 4422.8
i've already said this so many times if

4421.199 --> 4427.28
he would have just continued and

4422.8 --> 4430.56
resisted arrest and all that then

4427.28 --> 4432.639999999999
it would be war it would be civil war

4430.56 --> 4433.92
and it would have been very likely it

4432.64 --> 4435.52
would

4433.92 --> 4438.08
his entire works would have been

4435.52 --> 4438.080000000001
destroyed

4438.32 --> 4444.799999999999
right and his works his teachings

4442.88 --> 4447.4400000000005
he probably thought they were more

4444.8 --> 4447.4400000000005
important

4449.28 --> 4452.92
than to win

4480.56 --> 4483.56
oh

4488.239 --> 4492.799999999999
jesus resurrected lazarus

4490.48 --> 4494.48
before his own resurrection

4492.8 --> 4496.56
hmm

4494.48 --> 4499.5599999999995
i'd love to read that part that's

4496.56 --> 4499.56
interesting

4516.8 --> 4521.4400000000005
if christ didn't claim to be god

4519.36 --> 4524.159
why would he pharisees even accuse him

4521.44 --> 4526.5599999999995
of blasphemy because it was convenient

4524.159 --> 4526.5599999999995
to them

4531.28 --> 4534.28
right

4546.96 --> 4549.96
uh

4566.0 --> 4570.96
john chapter two okay i'll look into it

4569.6 --> 4573.6
i'll see

4570.96 --> 4574.56
what that is

4573.6 --> 4576.320000000001
maybe

4574.56 --> 4578.56
he taught

4576.32 --> 4581.84
him well i can't say that i'll have to

4578.56 --> 4581.84
read it

4589.199 --> 4595.4
we saw there

4590.64 --> 4595.400000000001
through their bsf scammer pack

4596.0 --> 4602.56
he healed the blind no but i think that

4600.0 --> 4605.44
that i think that he was a genuine

4602.56 --> 4607.280000000001
healer right that it's not like

4605.44 --> 4608.4
look here's the thing

4607.28 --> 4613.199
just because

4608.4 --> 4616.48
i think he might have not literally died

4613.199 --> 4619.5199999999995
have survived miraculously through the

4616.48 --> 4622.0
process of crucifixion and all that

4619.52 --> 4624.96
miraculously absolutely not denying the

4622.0 --> 4624.96
miracle of that

4625.36 --> 4629.199
and just because then you could say yeah

4627.52 --> 4631.1990000000005
maybe he was a bit of a trickster well

4629.199 --> 4634.0
that doesn't make everything a giant

4631.199 --> 4635.759999999999
magician's trick that he did

4634.0 --> 4640.159
right

4635.76 --> 4642.64
he did have blessed powers

4640.159 --> 4644.08
because of understanding because of the

4642.64 --> 4648.04
purity

4644.08 --> 4648.04
because of his knowledge

4660.64 --> 4665.6
ah thank you godzilla for the five

4663.04 --> 4666.8
canadian dollar super chat donation

4665.6 --> 4670.400000000001
well

4666.8 --> 4672.320000000001
have to get ready for work thanks

4670.4 --> 4676.36
for all you do irwin yeah you're welcome

4672.32 --> 4676.36
thank you for the super chat donation

4710.88 --> 4714.56
that's right matthew mitchell

4714.88 --> 4719.52
was so true he saw through all the bs

4717.76 --> 4721.12
imagine being in the presence of someone

4719.52 --> 4722.96
like that yes because there's certainly

4721.12 --> 4725.36
nothing you can hide

4722.96 --> 4726.8
like everything you try to hide from

4725.36 --> 4729.04
yourself

4726.8 --> 4730.400000000001
he then sees and by

4729.04 --> 4733.04
seeing that

4730.4 --> 4736.0
there's like a spiritual connection

4733.04 --> 4739.199
that forces your consciousness in the

4736.0 --> 4741.44
moment to kind of reflect upon it

4739.199 --> 4743.919999999999
and feel the weight of it again

4741.44 --> 4746.32
right and this leads some people that do

4743.92 --> 4750.0
not want to be awakened to take a

4746.32 --> 4753.28
hostile attitude and that is again

4750.0 --> 4755.6
the process of ascension like what he

4753.28 --> 4755.599999999999
said

4756.0 --> 4760.159
see too much

4757.36 --> 4762.719
you see people's flaws and they don't

4760.159 --> 4766.799999999999
want you to see it so they then start to

4762.719 --> 4766.8
conceal it more and attack you

4768.159 --> 4772.159
because they don't want to see their

4769.84 --> 4774.32
sins

4772.159 --> 4779.48
and they're gonna downplay you all of a

4774.32 --> 4779.48
sudden because oh now he's gone too far

4798.4 --> 4801.4
hmm

4814.4 --> 4819.04
yeah

4815.76 --> 4821.84
i'm glad you guys i there's still plenty

4819.04 --> 4824.8
of you here that can kind of understand

4821.84 --> 4827.92
what i'm trying to do

4824.8 --> 4830.159000000001
i feel i'm making myself very popular

4827.92 --> 4831.04
then again

4830.159 --> 4834.5599999999995
that's

4831.04 --> 4834.56
yeah i shouldn't be expecting to

4835.84 --> 4840.88
like actual truth is never really

4838.32 --> 4840.88
popular

4840.91 --> 4844.96
[Music]

4842.08 --> 4844.96
it's important

4845.6 --> 4850.639
but

4847.52 --> 4853.84
it's rare that people when confronted

4850.639 --> 4856.400000000001
will actually just be like oh yes

4853.84 --> 4856.400000000001
that's it

4857.44 --> 4861.5199999999995
unless it has

4859.36 --> 4864.0
traps built into it that are very

4861.52 --> 4866.080000000001
convenient for you to latch onto to

4864.0 --> 4867.28
relieve you of the burden of the true

4866.08 --> 4870.28
insight

4867.28 --> 4870.28
right

4880.4 --> 4886.48
because people

4883.12 --> 4889.04
they want a purpose for things so even

4886.48 --> 4890.799999999999
if they don't know anything about it

4889.04 --> 4892.639
in their minds if there's something

4890.8 --> 4895.04
really burdensome they're being

4892.639 --> 4896.159000000001
confronted with they have to assign a

4895.04 --> 4897.679
logical

4896.159 --> 4900.08
reason for it

4897.679 --> 4900.08
to them

4900.32 --> 4906.639
otherwise it's just painfully staring

4902.4 --> 4906.638999999999
them in the face without any context

4907.36 --> 4911.599999999999
so they have to fill it in for

4908.8 --> 4914.88
themselves based on how far their

4911.6 --> 4918.4800000000005
insight has reached up until that point

4914.88 --> 4918.4800000000005
that's how they reflect upon it

4924.96 --> 4927.96
hmm

4938.159 --> 4941.159
oh

4956.159 --> 4961.28
okay good servant well it's not cps's

4958.88 --> 4961.28
claim

4967.04 --> 4969.6
prophecy

4968.239 --> 4972.839999999999
yeah

4969.6 --> 4972.84
we know

5042.08 --> 5046.199
yeah that's a good point clutch

5057.92 --> 5060.8
right

5059.04 --> 5063.12
let me give you a little like a little

5060.8 --> 5064.639
mind puzzle on that

5063.12 --> 5066.4
he said

5064.639 --> 5068.84
we got to come together to see the full

5066.4 --> 5072.48
picture guess

5068.84 --> 5075.4400000000005
what a hermit right they isolate

5072.48 --> 5077.36
themselves they want to be alone

5075.44 --> 5080.638999999999
but would the hermet

5077.36 --> 5080.639
still feel like that

5081.44 --> 5088.36
if there was nobody out there to isolate

5084.8 --> 5088.360000000001
themselves from

5099.84 --> 5103.1990000000005
right

5101.04 --> 5105.44
it's usually because of the burdens of

5103.199 --> 5106.4
others

5105.44 --> 5109.199
that

5106.4 --> 5111.5199999999995
way that touch them that they seek

5109.199 --> 5113.12
isolation because they

5111.52 --> 5115.1990000000005
it dilutes

5113.12 --> 5118.239
their concentration their purity their

5115.199 --> 5121.919999999999
focus it distracts them away

5118.239 --> 5121.919999999999
from themselves and what they're doing

5122.4 --> 5125.679
so it's because of the reflections of

5124.719 --> 5129.12
others

5125.679 --> 5129.12
that they isolate themselves

5129.76 --> 5132.76
right

5140.159 --> 5144.239
right isn't that like the whole

5142.239 --> 5146.718999999999
mechanism for it it's like oh you go

5144.239 --> 5149.36
somewhere you're in a city and it's like

5146.719 --> 5152.0
oh my god everybody is just completely

5149.36 --> 5157.12
gutter minded and trash here

5152.0 --> 5157.12
that makes you want to go to the outback

5157.28 --> 5162.08
in a cabin in the woods and like oh

5159.6 --> 5163.84
thank god not

5162.08 --> 5166.88
in that

5163.84 --> 5168.56
right well if those trashy gutter-minded

5166.88 --> 5172.2390000000005
people wouldn't be there you wouldn't

5168.56 --> 5175.2390000000005
have that response to isolate yourself

5172.239 --> 5175.239
right

5188.4 --> 5191.4
so

5202.239 --> 5205.239
hmm

5229.6 --> 5233.04
they double believe this

5233.6 --> 5239.280000000001
now it just becomes a

5236.719 --> 5241.12
a string of chance dominoid that's

5239.28 --> 5242.5599999999995
really what it becomes it's like oh i

5241.12 --> 5244.719
believe this and that and that and

5242.56 --> 5246.56
there's already within the internal

5244.719 --> 5248.88
workings of one single belief

5246.56 --> 5251.1990000000005
contradictions so what does it matter

5248.88 --> 5253.28
that that belief is then

5251.199 --> 5254.879999999999
accompanied by another belief that also

5253.28 --> 5256.5599999999995
has contradictions and they all

5254.88 --> 5258.400000000001
contradict each other because it doesn't

5256.56 --> 5261.84
matter anymore once you latch on to one

5258.4 --> 5264.239
belief that has contradictions in it

5261.84 --> 5268.08
in the actions

5264.239 --> 5270.4
of it then yeah you can pile on whatever

5268.08 --> 5272.239
belief you like on next to it because

5270.4 --> 5274.0
you're already contradicting something

5272.239 --> 5277.28
so why would it have to make any

5274.0 --> 5280.84
cohesive sense altogether you know

5277.28 --> 5280.84
so yeah baller

5282.32 --> 5286.159
human sacrifice worshiping christian why

5284.96 --> 5290.6
not

5286.159 --> 5290.599999999999
can all fit together no problem

5306.84 --> 5310.8
hmm

5308.4 --> 5313.799999999999
interesting adam akin thanks for popping

5310.8 --> 5313.8
by

5344.239 --> 5348.199
hey seeking star wars

5377.199 --> 5379.839999999999
what

5381.44 --> 5384.5599999999995
i don't understand

5386.88 --> 5392.159000000001
infinity means

5390.239 --> 5393.599999999999
that all of the scenarios have happened

5392.159 --> 5396.599999999999
what

5393.6 --> 5396.6
what

5410.32 --> 5413.44
i am nice

5412.0 --> 5414.88
i just don't understand what she's

5413.44 --> 5417.12
saying it just

5414.88 --> 5417.12
what

5417.36 --> 5421.839999999999
that's not the way i use the word

5419.12 --> 5421.84
infinity but

5422.48 --> 5426.638999999999
it's all happened

5424.32 --> 5426.639
what

5432.4 --> 5437.36
i'm sure that everything he said

5434.159 --> 5439.759999999999
happened absolutely right

5437.36 --> 5441.92
that's why i like to re-emphasize that

5439.76 --> 5444.0
yeah he never said he died

5441.92 --> 5445.28
because i do actually believe that what

5444.0 --> 5448.28
jesus says

5445.28 --> 5448.28
happened

5459.36 --> 5462.679
oh okay

5497.679 --> 5501.1990000000005
okay

5498.719 --> 5505.8
well look seeking star wars if you're if

5501.199 --> 5505.799999999999
you're trying to communicate oh

5507.199 --> 5509.678999999999
hold on

5510.92 --> 5514.189
[Applause]

5514.32 --> 5520.639
if you're trying to communicate that

5518.08 --> 5521.92
what jesus did

5520.639 --> 5523.1990000000005
has

5521.92 --> 5524.0
like

5523.199 --> 5525.839999999999
like

5524.0 --> 5529.52
perfected

5525.84 --> 5532.32
existential fractal implications

5529.52 --> 5533.280000000001
that still echo onto this day i'd say oh

5532.32 --> 5534.639
yes

5533.28 --> 5536.639
if that is what you were trying to

5534.639 --> 5540.12
communicate effectively then i totally

5536.639 --> 5540.12
agree with you

5560.4 --> 5565.759999999999
ah cps yeah but that's hilarious because

5563.04 --> 5565.76
it's not true

5566.32 --> 5569.28
it's never gonna work

5571.6 --> 5577.52
right you can have infinite amounts of

5574.56 --> 5579.4400000000005
recombination

5577.52 --> 5582.639
monkeys are never going to type the

5579.44 --> 5582.638999999999
works of shakespeare

5583.36 --> 5588.4
like they're now never even going to do

5585.36 --> 5590.32
it even if you had a literal copy of the

5588.4 --> 5592.159
book

5590.32 --> 5594.639
then they will never

5592.159 --> 5596.879999999999
even copy it

5594.639 --> 5599.52
because that's not what they do

5596.88 --> 5601.28
unless they're not actually monkeys but

5599.52 --> 5603.84
mind controlled

5601.28 --> 5603.84
by people

5603.92 --> 5608.4800000000005
of life i don't know it's just never

5606.4 --> 5610.239
going to happen right doesn't matter how

5608.48 --> 5612.159
many

5610.239 --> 5614.5599999999995
recombinations

5612.159 --> 5616.719
you could imagine

5614.56 --> 5618.96
there to be it's never going to happen

5616.719 --> 5621.96
no matter what

5618.96 --> 5621.96
so

5645.52 --> 5651.040000000001
he came to fulfill the law could you put

5647.84 --> 5653.92
that into a a bigger context carol apple

5651.04 --> 5653.92
that would be great

5654.719 --> 5659.84
like what law what law did he name

5660.719 --> 5663.92
can he be more specific

5665.679 --> 5670.4
or was he not specific

5668.159 --> 5672.4
you know because

5670.4 --> 5674.4
there's already

5672.4 --> 5678.08
distinct signs that

5674.4 --> 5679.839999999999
jesus's father was not

5678.08 --> 5682.88
their father

5679.84 --> 5687.28
right so could it be that perhaps he was

5682.88 --> 5689.04
coming to fulfill the law of his father

5687.28 --> 5692.4
and not the other one have you ever

5689.04 --> 5695.04
considered that kara hubble

5692.4 --> 5696.719
right unless he names the laws and

5695.04 --> 5699.28
describes them

5696.719 --> 5701.84
and they are directly lifted from the

5699.28 --> 5701.84
old testament

5705.04 --> 5710.48
have you ever considered that kahuapu

5708.48 --> 5712.239
i still appreciate the input you know

5710.48 --> 5715.839999999999
but

5712.239 --> 5715.839999999999
this is what i do

5735.84 --> 5738.159000000001
hmm

5739.76 --> 5745.679
okay thanks adam interesting i'll check

5743.36 --> 5745.679
it out

5752.159 --> 5757.199
could you actually post that i'll post

5754.4 --> 5759.839999999999
that link

5757.199 --> 5759.839999999999
and skype

5763.199 --> 5767.44
i have a tendency to not keep my

5765.6 --> 5770.84
browser open

5767.44 --> 5770.839999999999
for too long

5778.48 --> 5781.718999999999
go ahead

5811.52 --> 5814.2390000000005
hmm

5811.87 --> 5816.239
[Music]

5814.239 --> 5818.159
right wow so this is what i meant

5816.239 --> 5821.199
earlier see now the weather's just

5818.159 --> 5823.199
completely turned around again

5821.199 --> 5825.599999999999
it's like one minute it's nice and sunny

5823.199 --> 5827.839999999999
then suddenly gray and clouded just like

5825.6 --> 5827.84
that

5830.239 --> 5836.599999999999
there's no

5831.679 --> 5836.6
no blue to be seen anywhere now

5862.96 --> 5865.96
hahaha

5868.239 --> 5871.759999999999
yeah

5869.199 --> 5873.5199999999995
clutch yeah that's

5871.76 --> 5876.0
it gets a little confusing like that

5873.52 --> 5876.0
doesn't it

5881.44 --> 5886.4
all right so i'm looking forward to that

5883.119 --> 5890.92
comment in chat go

5886.4 --> 5890.92
i'd love to see your input on that

5905.119 --> 5908.119
hmm

5981.36 --> 5985.759999999999
right guys i think i'm gonna run out a

5983.52 --> 5989.56
little early

5985.76 --> 5989.56
it's been very interesting

5998.159 --> 6001.839999999999
i think i'm kind of drained a little

6007.04 --> 6010.639
i'm very curious as to

6011.04 --> 6015.04
what kyo apple is gonna come up with

6015.52 --> 6022.639
because you know the thing is

6017.92 --> 6023.84
i still have even doubts about my own

6022.639 --> 6026.88
belief

6023.84 --> 6029.119000000001
my foresight about all of this

6026.88 --> 6029.119
like

6029.76 --> 6032.88
and i'm always hoping that somebody's

6031.6 --> 6035.92
gonna like

6032.88 --> 6038.08
lay something in front of me that will

6035.92 --> 6040.4
make it very clear

6038.08 --> 6042.239
that i have to be mistaken about this

6040.4 --> 6044.719
whole approach

6042.239 --> 6046.879999999999
okay that i really have to it's just

6044.719 --> 6049.679
that it's never happened before every

6046.88 --> 6051.36
time it's almost like i'm hoping

6049.679 --> 6053.1990000000005
hoping for that

6051.36 --> 6055.92
every time somebody puts something in

6053.199 --> 6059.44
front of me it it's always

6055.92 --> 6059.4400000000005
the same old stuff again

6061.76 --> 6067.6
the chanting machinations so

6065.28 --> 6067.599999999999
maybe

6070.08 --> 6076.76
maybe it'll will be different this time

6073.44 --> 6076.759999999999
who knows

6082.08 --> 6087.36
anyway i got definitely got some

6084.08 --> 6087.36
material to think about

6087.76 --> 6091.6
adam can link me up with a whole bunch

6089.679 --> 6096.119
of stuff

6091.6 --> 6096.119000000001

6162.719 --> 6167.04
bunch of people out there the wrong way

6165.04 --> 6168.8
isn't that ironic that's i'm doing this

6167.04 --> 6170.48
right at the time when i'm actually kind

6168.8 --> 6173.28
of desperate

6170.48 --> 6174.959999999999
to get some more funds and it seems to

6173.28 --> 6177.84
be

6174.96 --> 6177.84
not very

6179.199 --> 6184.719
accommodating at the time

6182.08 --> 6186.96
but yeah i'm gonna do this

6184.719 --> 6189.6
i hope i'm not gonna

6186.96 --> 6190.8
go completely dead broke

6189.6 --> 6193.6
because of it

6190.8 --> 6195.28
but if i will then so be it

6193.6 --> 6197.92
so be it

6195.28 --> 6199.92
i'll just be destitute that's just

6197.92 --> 6203.52
freaking great

6199.92 --> 6205.36
i'll be very very pissed off

6203.52 --> 6207.92
if that happens

6205.36 --> 6207.92
we'll see

6208.239 --> 6213.4
right so i will be back tomorrow with
