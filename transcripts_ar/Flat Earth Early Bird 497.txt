303.2 --> 309.46999999999997
do also is wait until the life part of

307.67 --> 313.64000000000004
the Flat Earth debates are over and then

309.47 --> 320.15000000000003
livestream it you could take a lot of

313.64 --> 322.34
our audience you know especially if you

320.15 --> 325.66999999999996
if you share that you're doing a

322.34 --> 328.41999999999996
premiere of me in the chat over at

325.67 --> 330.76
Nathan's at the end of the live show

328.42 --> 334.97
just sayin it's just a suggestion

330.76 --> 338.56
premiers tend to get a lot more views

334.97 --> 338.56
than just uploads just sayin

347.3 --> 365.43
I'll leave it up to you guys okay why

361.02 --> 374.219
you guys think about it and I'll

365.43 --> 376.58
continue this show so what was going on

374.219 --> 376.58
yesterday

383.559 --> 390.27900000000005
yeah I need to compose myself for a bit

386.529 --> 393.399
because after the recording went off I

390.279 --> 396.36899999999997
went a little heavy with good servant

393.399 --> 398.799
and and Tom Parker in the sense that I

396.369 --> 401.439
shared some personal issues that I'm

398.799 --> 404.82899999999995
dealing with and that's now distracting

401.439 --> 408.54900000000004
me cuz I have to I get my mind back like

404.829 --> 419.709
what was I doing yesterday I i wit twit

408.549 --> 420.87899999999996
hello I'm good to see you um let's see I

419.709 --> 426.009
think there was an old Benjamin

420.879 --> 428.379
yesterday right yeah I'm getting like my

426.009 --> 431.469
D live notifications are being extremely

428.379 --> 436.329
late it's almost the same kind of

431.469 --> 438.699
nuisance I'm getting from YouTube like

436.329 --> 440.529
suddenly the notifications very late

438.699 --> 441.639
just start piling up in the corner it's

440.529 --> 444.849
like blahblah blahblahblah

441.639 --> 446.349
it's like what that was all hours ago

444.849 --> 454.029
what's the point

446.349 --> 457.989
I wonder which program actually steers

454.029 --> 460.719
that mechanism like what is what is

457.989 --> 464.349
technically causing this weird pop-up

460.719 --> 470.709
delay of this information system why is

464.349 --> 474.429
it doing that yeah I'm just wondering

470.709 --> 477.819
anyway on Benjamin was good I saw a

474.429 --> 480.75899999999996
piano time as it were very late for a

477.819 --> 482.499
most part but I did like cut out halfway

480.759 --> 486.039
because I remember oh wait I have to get

482.499 --> 489.53900000000004
up early because I I gotta be on good

486.039 --> 496.679
servant than Tom Parker show so I went

489.539 --> 500.649
to bed before like half past three and

496.679 --> 503.63899999999995
yeah that good pretty good night I do

500.649 --> 503.639
think I have

504.26 --> 510.32
yeah it's like my body is again in

508.13 --> 512.0
another face I seem to have certain

510.32 --> 513.919
specific type of issues that are

512.0 --> 521.6
arriving and other issues that have gone

513.919 --> 527.21
away it's odd so yeah everything's still

521.6 --> 530.83
good okay let's get back I'm getting a

527.21 --> 534.1
bit jumbled here right watch on Benjamin

530.83 --> 540.61
watched a movie which movie was that

534.1 --> 540.61
which movie what did I watch

554.85 --> 562.23
wait did I watching Netflix they don't

558.4 --> 562.23
watch a movie on Netflix I could have

566.31 --> 574.6899999999999
doesn't Netflix even have a list as to

568.93 --> 578.1999999999999
what you've watched I don't think so

574.69 --> 581.7
what why if do I have such trouble

578.2 --> 581.7
remembering this is weird

601.97 --> 605.139
[Music]

607.86 --> 610.519
hi

614.37 --> 617.18
latest

631.87 --> 636.649
that's so weird you know there's all

634.399 --> 645.68
these in Netflix all these options but

636.649 --> 648.379
there's no direct clickable thing as to

645.68 --> 653.12
the watched list what have you watch

648.379 --> 656.9590000000001
it's no list just isn't there if you

653.12 --> 658.43
don't like add movies or whatever to

656.959 --> 663.3389999999999
your favorite list as you're watching

658.43 --> 663.3389999999999
them you probably just forget about them

665.66 --> 668.75
[Music]

678.5 --> 687.32
it is in your account settings account

683.46 --> 687.32
settings account

691.78 --> 706.54
recent defy streaming activity but

696.73 --> 713.6700000000001
manage download didn't know I don't see

706.54 --> 713.67
it a viewing activity hold on

715.92 --> 718.579
well

721.2 --> 724.7090000000001
okay I'm pretty certain now that I

723.54 --> 726.75
didn't watch a movie on Netflix

724.709 --> 728.04
yesterday this is interesting oh thank

726.75 --> 731.1
you for the tip I didn't know that

728.04 --> 734.579
that's handy there is actually a way to

731.1 --> 737.76
find it thanks for that then I probably

734.579 --> 740.9899999999999
watched a movie I don't know why is not

737.76 --> 740.99
in the list though what

790.48 --> 795.24
sorry for this long silence

802.269 --> 808.36
I'm just gonna I really want to know

804.459 --> 811.3789999999999
what I watched now I find it very

808.36 --> 811.379
annoying that I don't remember

836.709 --> 839.709
hmm

852.84 --> 857.97
oh damn it of course of course I'd

856.5 --> 860.82
completely look past it

857.97 --> 863.73
completely silly of me yeah I did

860.82 --> 865.74
actually watch a movie yeah wow it only

863.73 --> 866.94
took me like 10 minutes to figure that

865.74 --> 871.49
out of five minutes

866.94 --> 880.8000000000001
Jesus yeah I watched Joker

871.49 --> 886.26
so that happened was a well it was as

880.8 --> 891.63
freaky as I expected and yeah well

886.26 --> 894.8
extremely dark and realized a couple of

891.63 --> 894.8
creepy things about it

908.53 --> 913.5799999999999
okay well anyways sorry for being so

911.24 --> 916.16
chit so distracted that there's not even

913.58 --> 919.76
much I'm gonna say about the movie it's

916.16 --> 922.3399999999999
just that there I already had seen like

919.76 --> 924.88
reviews of it without any content or

922.34 --> 928.73
like political reflections upon it so

924.88 --> 936.83
that yeah in that sense it was kind of

928.73 --> 940.6
like what I expected but yeah it's one

936.83 --> 940.6
of those things that I just wonder like

941.5 --> 952.16
hmm also how it ended it was kind of

949.4 --> 954.56
like yeah that was kind of the entry to

952.16 --> 959.42
a Batman story so is this gonna lead to

954.56 --> 965.7399999999999
a new type of does it properly connect

959.42 --> 965.74
to like Batman Begins does it do that

966.22 --> 971.3000000000001
maybe I'd have to watch Batman Begins

968.96 --> 974.33
again and then compare what it looked

971.3 --> 976.0999999999999
like how they look back to the history

974.33 --> 978.86
of it because I remember that there was

976.1 --> 980.99
that part and then see if it ties in

978.86 --> 984.5
somehow if that works out or if this is

980.99 --> 992.63
just more like a new starts for a new

984.5 --> 997.7
that again you thought Joker Sock'em are

992.63 --> 1001.5
colored well yeah in ways it did it was

997.7 --> 1001.5
just mostly about trauma

1004.67 --> 1009.3
just lots and lots of trauma and like

1007.44 --> 1011.7900000000001
impossible to deal with situations

1009.3 --> 1017.0699999999999
everything was about impossible to deal

1011.79 --> 1020.39
with situations so it was just it was

1017.07 --> 1023.97
choking and then showing like yeah boom

1020.39 --> 1028.92
the the backlash it was it was kind of

1023.97 --> 1031.79
basic like that the setup but yeah it

1028.92 --> 1036.3500000000001
wasn't a very pleasant roofie it was

1031.79 --> 1036.35
like interesting though

1039.41 --> 1045.3200000000002
but yeah it's like this guy's like

1042.32 --> 1045.32
ridiculous

1049.44 --> 1057.39
it is a tragedy technically in this and

1053.63 --> 1059.3400000000001
yeah it's like yeah there's like what

1057.39 --> 1061.8600000000001
it's like what do you expect yeah it's

1059.34 --> 1064.5
like the [ __ ] like what is gonna happen

1061.86 --> 1066.9299999999998
what are the social justice warriors

1064.5 --> 1069.53
gonna save this guy there doesn't seem

1066.93 --> 1078.5900000000001
to be any in this movie or just one

1069.53 --> 1078.59
maybe so yeah that's it was odd

1078.92 --> 1085.7
everybody was being a dick in the entire

1081.51 --> 1089.79
freakin movie except for a few like

1085.7 --> 1091.95
apparently the [ __ ] guy and that black

1089.79 --> 1097.67
lady that's the only one I can remember

1091.95 --> 1097.67
that that were like kind of nice

1103.519 --> 1109.47
and and with the black lady I don't mean

1106.98 --> 1113.159
like the girlfriend cuz that was just

1109.47 --> 1115.759
what the hell you know ya didn't like

1113.159 --> 1120.019
that at all it was all about just

1115.759 --> 1122.46
Depression culture and and like being in

1120.019 --> 1126.929
impossible victim positions and it's

1122.46 --> 1131.6390000000001
right I get why you won't like it

1126.929 --> 1135.74
it isn't a pleasant movie oh I did

against these crimes against humanity

1412.05 --> 1419.84
what do you mean Jorge Sanford you mean

1415.89 --> 1419.8400000000001
the the lockdown

1427.59 --> 1432.3999999999999
then there's a lot of craziness going

1429.73 --> 1435.18
out out going on out there right now

1432.4 --> 1435.18
that's true

1454.78 --> 1460.22
yeah jar 10 when are we all gonna stand

1457.94 --> 1463.94
up and stop their nasty game well I

1460.22 --> 1469.51
don't know I don't think it's gonna take

1463.94 --> 1474.2
too long you know with all this these

1469.51 --> 1476.87
the lock downs and I know it's look out

1474.2 --> 1481.31
here it's not that bad you know

1476.87 --> 1483.4099999999999
it really is it but I do hear that in

1481.31 --> 1489.62
other countries like the police is

1483.41 --> 1492.0500000000002
getting really crazy with it so I've

1489.62 --> 1494.09
heard because the I haven't personally

1492.05 --> 1497.21
seen it although there's probably some

1494.09 --> 1499.72
videos of it there's on the news in the

1497.21 --> 1503.1200000000001
Netherlands videos about I'm pretty sure

1499.72 --> 1508.52
but again I don't really follow too much

1503.12 --> 1510.11
Dutch news because it's just once you

1508.52 --> 1513.83
get caught up and that you just don't

1510.11 --> 1521.6899999999998
have any more energy Freddie I like to

1513.83 --> 1524.53
look around a little bit more what is

1521.69 --> 1524.53
that mark call it

1536.9 --> 1539.5600000000002
all right

1554.01 --> 1559.4
very hard to have optimistic opinions

1556.68 --> 1566.04
regarding corona in the globe earth

1559.4 --> 1568.5600000000002
circles I can't imagine but maybe that

1566.04 --> 1575.6399999999999
is also because they in a way are just

1568.56 --> 1577.6499999999999
pissed off at the world you know they're

1575.64 --> 1579.99
probably like why is everybody allowing

1577.65 --> 1582.0900000000001
all these flat earther synthesis they

1579.99 --> 1583.5
don't say that maybe they will be like

1582.09 --> 1588.0
ooh a free speech of course very

1583.5 --> 1589.77
important but some of them at least at

1588.0 --> 1593.93
the same time they're like why is this

1589.77 --> 1593.93
continuing the real believers you know

1594.53 --> 1601.02
and the more you get stuck in a corner

1598.53 --> 1605.19
the more aggressive your mindset will

1601.02 --> 1606.87
become you want it all to change so yeah

1605.19 --> 1608.8500000000001
there probably will be a lot of people

1606.87 --> 1612.3899999999999
that are kind of stressed out in their

1608.85 --> 1615.7199999999998
life believe too much nonsense are too

1612.39 --> 1618.5400000000002
gravelled up they don't have any room to

1615.72 --> 1622.44
change anything or everything falls

1618.54 --> 1624.54
apart and then yeah they get really

1622.44 --> 1631.17
pissed off at the world and they're like

1624.54 --> 1634.92
oh yeah stupid stupid humanity like go

1631.17 --> 1637.77
get em corona old people whatever that

1634.92 --> 1642.71
kind of nonsense it's really just their

1637.77 --> 1645.69
life is so messed up that it's like a

1642.71 --> 1647.88
it's like trolling the world pretty much

1645.69 --> 1652.28
they're like so stressed out that they

1647.88 --> 1652.2800000000002
just go ballistic

1654.11 --> 1657.9199999999998
that's what I think it's like

1672.61 --> 1676.649
they need to believe that no I

1678.55 --> 1681.6599999999999
no idea

1684.84 --> 1689.299
we have frightened oligarchs keeping

1687.36 --> 1691.9699999999998
everyone six feet away from each other

1689.299 --> 1694.679
stop stay where you are

1691.97 --> 1697.8600000000001
well you know what I personally don't

1694.679 --> 1699.8400000000001
have a lot of trouble with ya some

1697.86 --> 1702.1789999999999
personal distance I actually prefer that

1699.84 --> 1706.58
I don't really like standing close to

1702.179 --> 1711.39
people that I don't know unless there is

1706.58 --> 1713.25
there like interesting good people but

1711.39 --> 1716.0700000000002
that doesn't happen a lot

1713.25 --> 1718.14
so the been that's more personal so I'm

1716.07 --> 1721.47
personally not I don't have an objection

1718.14 --> 1725.279
to that even too much it's just that

1721.47 --> 1727.77
people being afraid constantly and not

1725.279 --> 1729.69
wanting to get to know new people and

1727.77 --> 1731.85
all that that comes out of it that's the

1729.69 --> 1735.409
part that I don't like and I especially

1731.85 --> 1738.12
don't really like just the supposed

1735.409 --> 1740.49
enforcement like oh if it was the stores

1738.12 --> 1743.3899999999999
got to do this and do that specifically

1740.49 --> 1746.789
and otherwise they'll get in trouble

1743.39 --> 1749.789
it's like yeah I don't like the

1746.789 --> 1752.1299999999999
enforcement but I have no problem at all

1749.789 --> 1755.57
with people just having a little

1752.13 --> 1755.5700000000002
respectful distance you know

1763.86 --> 1770.61
right Marco let's see like even Owen

1767.46 --> 1772.5
Benjamin says it to Big Bear it's like

1770.61 --> 1775.4599999999998
yeah I have no problem with social

1772.5 --> 1778.559
distance like keep the [ __ ] away from me

1775.46 --> 1782.8500000000001
in a way yeah I have no problem with

1778.559 --> 1788.7
that but if it is done specifically

1782.85 --> 1790.4699999999998
because you're afraid you know that is

1788.7 --> 1798.24
something else that is kind of annoying

1790.47 --> 1800.73
that doesn't help a lot but I don't know

1798.24 --> 1804.049
like if somebody were to be like really

1800.73 --> 1807.1200000000001
having a real cult then yeah

1804.049 --> 1810.99
keep your distance don't just stumble

1807.12 --> 1814.7689999999998
around and just go hang on to somebody

1810.99 --> 1821.63
or something you know that that is just

1814.769 --> 1821.63
unpleasant but in general yeah

1825.95 --> 1828.6100000000001
like

1828.889 --> 1834.99
although I have noticed that I've even

1831.919 --> 1837.3600000000001
it's just the way people pay attention

1834.99 --> 1840.539
now is different it's odd like I was in

1837.36 --> 1842.58
the staircase one time I went to go down

1840.539 --> 1847.61
and then three guys were moving stuff

1842.58 --> 1851.999
and I kind of wanted to go past but I

1847.61 --> 1854.61
felt like I would get too close it's odd

1851.999 --> 1856.759
and it's not that I'm afraid it's just

1854.61 --> 1858.7489999999998
that they might take offense because

1856.759 --> 1860.369
they were the types

1858.749 --> 1864.619
they were very yeah they were like in

1860.369 --> 1864.619
the 20s or something looking the very

1864.83 --> 1873.149
whatever they had they had the cocked

1868.11 --> 1876.059
look liberal but that's like most Dutch

1873.149 --> 1877.4399999999998
people in that age guy or he nowadays so

1876.059 --> 1879.6589999999999
I didn't want to offend them and just

1877.44 --> 1882.419
wait it like until they got inside their

1879.659 --> 1884.909
door and then but it was odd to notice

1882.419 --> 1887.69
like wait I I'm actually not comfortable

1884.909 --> 1890.279
going past because I might offend them

1887.69 --> 1892.5900000000001
and I don't want to you know in the

1890.279 --> 1896.869
building that I live I have something to

1892.59 --> 1899.399
I want to be the like the fallback guy I

1896.869 --> 1908.129
want to protect this place I don't want

1899.399 --> 1910.1999999999998
to offend anyone if I don't have to hey

1908.129 --> 1913.1999999999998
Jody of heaven yes can I post a link

1910.2 --> 1917.539
here to show on TV that had a skid on

1913.2 --> 1917.539
flat earth sure sure why not

1923.66 --> 1927.3200000000002
according to yourself three years ago

1925.73 --> 1931.03
the rest of well is just catching up huh

1927.32 --> 1934.6399999999999
well I kind of quarantined myself when

1931.03 --> 1936.23
like after the Amsterdam show Hamsterdam

1934.64 --> 1938.3600000000001
sure after the accident conference

1936.23 --> 1941.419
because remember I got pretty damn sick

1938.36 --> 1943.85
after that and I felt it coming a new

1941.419 --> 1946.4
world was gonna come that's why I also

1943.85 --> 1949.2099999999998
decided not to go on any long term tour

1946.4 --> 1952.929
because I knew I'm gonna get very sick

1949.21 --> 1952.929
and I did

1963.69 --> 1968.3300000000002
how do I look like Orlando Bloom that's

1965.79 --> 1968.33
ridiculous

1971.97 --> 1978.48
Orlando Bloom has a much is a different

1975.75 --> 1981.54
type of build head so I don't see the

1978.48 --> 1985.74
resemblance really or are you referring

1981.54 --> 1987.78
to my voice because I can get a little

1985.74 --> 1989.88
bland sometimes and I think Arlanda

1987.78 --> 1994.05
bloom is kind of infamous for that or

1989.88 --> 1998.3400000000001
like infamous in a hilarious way how he

1994.05 --> 1999.69
can stay so monotonous and yet still

1998.34 --> 2008.0
sound kind of intellectual and

1999.69 --> 2013.7
interesting is that it land of bloom has

2008.0 --> 2017.96
a Katy Perry what you look like him oh

2013.7 --> 2025.55
thanks thanks well maybe you should I

2017.96 --> 2026.24
don't know compare it you know what this

2025.55 --> 2039.05
is ridiculous

2026.24 --> 2043.6
oh wait I think I mixed him up with

2039.05 --> 2043.6
another guy who's this

2049.29 --> 2062.06
oh wait he played Legolas today huh

2053.399 --> 2062.06
I I thought who's the other guy

2066.7 --> 2070.77
it was the guy I thought off manner

2078.65 --> 2087.13
is that it it's a great second Darwin

2082.73 --> 2095.2400000000002
yeah yeah okay do I look a bit like him

2087.13 --> 2100.57
the lil I guess although he has beard

2095.24 --> 2100.5699999999997
capability so it seems I don't know

2112.4 --> 2115.119
maybe

2117.66 --> 2120.98
do we look like him

2126.8 --> 2129.79
hmm

2132.74 --> 2141.9199999999996
I don't know a little I guess that's

2138.32 --> 2143.869
weird I never even realized that but

2141.92 --> 2144.44
then again I haven't really looked at

2143.869 --> 2147.28
him

2144.44 --> 2150.17
usually the way that I see him is as

2147.28 --> 2152.7200000000003
Legolas with blond hair and then I look

2150.17 --> 2156.1
at it and say like okay well I

2152.72 --> 2156.1
definitely don't look like that

2163.259 --> 2170.43
well I could be his twin now come on

2167.43 --> 2170.43
ridiculous

2173.12 --> 2181.2599999999998
[Music]

2181.739 --> 2190.599
no Shawn

2183.519 --> 2202.029
Thornhill no who was T the other guy

2190.599 --> 2212.589
he's like also called bloom there's the

2202.029 --> 2214.66
other guy now hmm I think I completely

2212.589 --> 2224.68
got the name wrong by the way but I

2214.66 --> 2227.319
don't know I'm gonna figure this one out

2224.68 --> 2232.3289999999997
and I'm kind of pissed off at not

2227.319 --> 2237.39
knowing Oh God

2232.329 --> 2237.3900000000003
yeah now I understand yep all right

2241.01 --> 2250.19
I am terrible at names terrible I know I

2248.72 --> 2255.2799999999997
thought I thought you meant Jeff

2250.19 --> 2259.13
Goldblum I don't know why I thought that

2255.28 --> 2261.349
why I think Orlando Bloom is that it's

2259.13 --> 2265.7000000000003
not even close well it has a bloom in it

2261.349 --> 2268.9100000000003
I guess the sound it's ridiculous

2265.7 --> 2280.3999999999996
okay yeah but I I definitely don't look

2268.91 --> 2283.25
like that guy at least I am terrible at

2280.4 --> 2286.3
names but I don't forget faces and they

2283.25 --> 2286.3
don't forget voices

2296.82 --> 2314.98
[Music]

2298.85 --> 2317.15
I need a sword I but I have a sword I

2314.98 --> 2327.83
have everything I need

2317.15 --> 2330.89
I even have chainmail the and to be fair

2327.83 --> 2333.59
I even have elven ears props but I'm

2330.89 --> 2336.95
just not gonna go there anymore it's

2333.59 --> 2339.77
ridiculous but yes I I was into

2336.95 --> 2341.5899999999997
live-action role-playing for a while it

2339.77 --> 2347.95
was ridiculous

2341.59 --> 2347.9500000000003
but I kind of liked the dress-up part I

2349.12 --> 2354.35
had all kinds of things for it it was a

2352.34 --> 2356.9900000000002
pretty big show it's just that the group

2354.35 --> 2360.38
that I went to to go LARPing

2356.99 --> 2362.0
they didn't give a [ __ ] about me so I

2360.38 --> 2364.31
was there like yeah I am an elephant

2362.0 --> 2366.86
Prince look at my freaking jewelry most

2364.31 --> 2369.08
of which I made myself in my style like

2366.86 --> 2370.88
this and it's not a freaking plastic

2369.08 --> 2373.1
prop now that's freaking real silver

2370.88 --> 2375.38
that's right [ __ ] like that so I was

2373.1 --> 2378.79
like yeah I'm I'm an elven Prince I got

2375.38 --> 2381.26
stuff I got a giant treasure chest with

2378.79 --> 2384.83
gold and diamonds and [ __ ]

2381.26 --> 2387.17
and they just didn't give a [ __ ] about

2384.83 --> 2389.69
me as a character and it's they

2387.17 --> 2392.63
literally at some point just let me get

2389.69 --> 2400.06
robbed and then killed me and I was like

2392.63 --> 2400.06
okay this group sucks I'm out of here

2402.49 --> 2409.52
so they didn't give [ __ ] they were too

2407.09 --> 2411.71
caught up in their own stuff around long

2409.52 --> 2415.15
term stories that I'd played for 20

2411.71 --> 2415.15
years and such it's crazy

2418.1 --> 2429.22
I didn't even become why didn't I become

2424.25 --> 2434.77
a theatrical actor well stage fright I

2429.22 --> 2438.5899999999997
guess and I'm not liberal I'm very

2434.77 --> 2442.73
allergic to that [ __ ] and I'm kind of

2438.59 --> 2444.73
allergic to people acting extra gay and

2442.73 --> 2449.2400000000002
that kind of [ __ ] and that happens a lot

2444.73 --> 2453.05
it's like you're I don't want to live a

2449.24 --> 2461.2999999999997
life where I'm constantly like it's not

2453.05 --> 2463.57
good why are you talking about you're an

2461.3 --> 2463.57
uptown

2480.569 --> 2486.839
right well more colored look that you

2483.39 --> 2489.0589999999997
know me me not liking gay things it's

2486.839 --> 2491.759
not because I want exterminate people

2489.059 --> 2495.949
works against God even now it's just

2491.759 --> 2502.499
that every time I see that it annoys me

2495.949 --> 2508.349
it's in my system I tried to get that

2502.499 --> 2510.839
out it didn't go away it's like even as

2508.349 --> 2513.449
I was kind of like submerged into being

2510.839 --> 2515.249
a young liberal [ __ ] and all that if

2513.449 --> 2517.919
people would start to get really gay

2515.249 --> 2520.529
next to me I would either almost throw

2517.919 --> 2522.859
up or I just suddenly get really pissed

2520.529 --> 2522.859
off

2522.949 --> 2533.7290000000003
it's just it can't work it doesn't work

2526.709 --> 2535.109
I can't handle that I I have no problem

2533.729 --> 2537.6299999999997
you know if whatever they want to do

2535.109 --> 2540.569
it's just like as long as I'm kind of

2537.63 --> 2546.589
present please just dim it a little you

2540.569 --> 2546.589
know that's all

2554.44 --> 2561.3
though it does it isn't nice what do you

2557.56 --> 2561.2999999999997
think it's like for me turnip tower

2571.61 --> 2576.86
what do you think it's like for me when

2573.62 --> 2579.68
I live in a country where through

2576.86 --> 2581.84
corporations and media every end

2579.68 --> 2584.66
especially advertisements and all that

2581.84 --> 2594.2000000000003
it's just everybody is being coerced

2584.66 --> 2597.7999999999997
into acting gay why do you think it's

2594.2 --> 2604.3999999999996
like for me to sleep through all that

2597.8 --> 2608.15
and to just know that as soon as you act

2604.4 --> 2610.64
out with aggression in some way they're

2608.15 --> 2613.52
literally just gonna arrest you or that

2610.64 --> 2620.3599999999997
kind of [ __ ] what do you think that's

2613.52 --> 2626.77
like for a guy like me it's not very

2620.36 --> 2626.77
pleasant so I try not to think about it

2631.56 --> 2643.35
you know what yeah I'm not gonna yeah

2638.99 --> 2646.35
hurt myself over over this issue like I

2643.35 --> 2648.54
that happens because it's like if it's a

2646.35 --> 2651.02
physiological response it's it's not a

2648.54 --> 2656.489
choice that I make

2651.02 --> 2656.489
[Music]

2662.19 --> 2666.77
well Jorn up they'll do you think it's

2664.319 --> 2672.359
okay to express angers again

2666.77 --> 2674.73
heterosexuals what are you saying that

2672.359 --> 2676.859
you can never be angry against the gay

2674.73 --> 2680.51
person if you're not gay Jorn up though

2676.859 --> 2680.5099999999998
is that what you're saying

2708.96 --> 2715.92
okay well then why are you asking so you

2713.46 --> 2718.23
think it is okay well it's not even

2715.92 --> 2720.359
asking it's kind of stating so you think

2718.23 --> 2723.2
it is okay to express anger towards case

2720.359 --> 2730.17
what the that kind of implies something

2723.2 --> 2733.77
it implies sarcasm or I just you know

2730.17 --> 2736.53
what I mean because why would does it

2733.77 --> 2740.25
does it matter does it matter what their

2736.53 --> 2744.65
sexual nature is or whatever I don't

2740.25 --> 2747.89
think so matters what they behave like

2744.65 --> 2747.89
what they do

2751.97 --> 2756.64
right that's what it's all about

2766.2 --> 2771.45
if they bump into me by a key why would

2768.75 --> 2774.39
I get angry if a gay person would bump

2771.45 --> 2779.37
into me by accident what kind of

2774.39 --> 2782.79
ridiculous Monica that's ridiculous yarn

2779.37 --> 2785.0699999999997
that's really weird to say that why

2782.79 --> 2789.15
would I get angry if a gay person would

2785.07 --> 2791.36
accidentally bump into me why that makes

2789.15 --> 2791.36
no sense

2792.09 --> 2796.55
why would I get angry for anybody

2794.04 --> 2799.29
accidentally bumping into me you know I

2796.55 --> 2801.0600000000004
might get annoyed because I didn't want

2799.29 --> 2802.62
to get bumped into it doesn't mean I'm

2801.06 --> 2804.47
gonna get angry at him why would I do

2802.62 --> 2806.96
that

2804.47 --> 2809.5699999999997
again what does it matter if they're gay

2806.96 --> 2812.46
it's not about that you don't get it

2809.57 --> 2816.9900000000002
it's about being socially in the

2812.46 --> 2819.03
presence for example gay people that are

2816.99 --> 2822.75
like really really freaking gay and

2819.03 --> 2825.9300000000003
they're like oh and so game no that kind

2822.75 --> 2829.23
of thing when I'm just sitting there cuz

2825.93 --> 2831.0899999999997
I I can't do anything with that and I

2829.23 --> 2832.92
don't like it and if it then gets worse

2831.09 --> 2835.9500000000003
and worse it get agitated

2832.92 --> 2837.81
that's it's not like Oh bump into

2835.95 --> 2840.45
accident no but if I would be in the

2837.81 --> 2843.09
presence of such a situation eventually

2840.45 --> 2844.7999999999997
if it if it doesn't change if

2843.09 --> 2846.63
everybody's all just gushing over

2844.8 --> 2850.53
wanting it to be more and more

2846.63 --> 2855.27
I'll just go away I'm not gonna get

2850.53 --> 2860.94
angry makes no sense it's just it feels

2855.27 --> 2863.57
like this is not for me that's all so I

2860.94 --> 2872.2200000000003
don't know yeah what you're trying to

2863.57 --> 2874.1400000000003
pull here but no makes me angry a gay

2872.22 --> 2877.5
couple show affections to it makes me

2874.14 --> 2881.67
angry no that doesn't why we'll know it

2877.5 --> 2883.95
might I think maybe like or something

2881.67 --> 2887.46
you know that's true

2883.95 --> 2891.0
I may have like I don't like seeing that

2887.46 --> 2894.78
now what gets me angry though is for

2891.0 --> 2897.51
example when I whatever if I would be

2894.78 --> 2899.9100000000003
watching television and like in every

2897.51 --> 2903.15
freaking advertisement it's always

2899.91 --> 2905.22
the same [ __ ] shelf in your face yeah if

2903.15 --> 2908.1600000000003
constantly wherever I go I would

2905.22 --> 2911.4599999999996
constantly just get this icon of you

2908.16 --> 2913.68
know gay kissing men or whatever if I

2911.46 --> 2917.7
had to be if I would be forced to

2913.68 --> 2918.72
constantly look upon that yes that would

2917.7 --> 2924.27
piss me off

2918.72 --> 2926.8799999999997
that's right but just men in the world

2924.27 --> 2928.2
wanting to kiss sometime you know I

2926.88 --> 2930.0
don't like it

2928.2 --> 2932.819
that doesn't mean that I'm gonna good

2930.0 --> 2935.01
how dare you walk up to them and as you

2932.819 --> 2941.16
just stop at the Lord says she shouldn't

2935.01 --> 2946.789
do that no can can we get real here for

2941.16 --> 2946.7889999999998
a moment you're not down please please

2954.75 --> 2961.31
okay well thank you for telling me that

2957.599 --> 2965.94
that is okay appreciate it

2961.31 --> 2971.04
that doesn't really matter to me though

2965.94 --> 2976.7000000000003
I you thought I was talking what are you

2971.04 --> 2980.16
talking about about real life well dude

2976.7 --> 2981.96
look the issue is if you're like

2980.16 --> 2983.8799999999997
watching TV or whatever and you

2981.96 --> 2986.13
constantly get gay stuff shoved in your

2983.88 --> 2987.3900000000003
face yeah that's gonna piss you off but

2986.13 --> 2990.84
you could do something about it you can

2987.39 --> 2992.0099999999998
turn it off do something else well in

2990.84 --> 2995.82
the real world that doesn't really

2992.01 --> 2998.3100000000004
happen that much you know unless you've

2995.82 --> 2999.9300000000003
go to a gay bar something yeah oh I'm

2998.31 --> 3002.06
gonna get pissed off because I went to a

2999.93 --> 3003.73
gay bar and solidus kissing men and you

3002.06 --> 3010.43
yeah no [ __ ]

3003.73 --> 3013.55
that's why I don't go there see it's I'm

3010.43 --> 3016.66
not look I don't see it that much and

3013.55 --> 3021.1600000000003
I'm kind of happy about it too you know

3016.66 --> 3021.16
but yeah I don't go looking for it

3030.27 --> 3041.13
he's implying that I discriminate well I

3034.02 --> 3042.93
do distinguish between things and people

3041.13 --> 3045.23
and how they conduct themselves and what

3042.93 --> 3048.0899999999997
energies they let go through them

3045.23 --> 3050.73
decisions they make yes definitely

3048.09 --> 3056.4500000000003
discriminate it doesn't mean that I'm

3050.73 --> 3063.93
gonna disrespect a person just because

3056.45 --> 3066.0899999999997
they're in a certain way but I

3063.93 --> 3068.6299999999997
definitely will distinguish I will

3066.09 --> 3073.4700000000003
definitely say like yeah that is that

3068.63 --> 3077.79
absolutely and it's gonna alter the way

3073.47 --> 3079.9399999999996
I make decisions concerning it I do

3077.79 --> 3083.85
that's right

3079.94 --> 3085.77
but I try to just be responsible and

3083.85 --> 3091.7999999999997
also realize that people are in a

3085.77 --> 3095.34
certain way not because of some kind of

3091.8 --> 3097.619
evil intent know if people are all lost

3095.34 --> 3100.44
and twisted it's usually because they're

3097.619 --> 3104.4500000000003
just mistaken or their dwelling it's not

3100.44 --> 3108.15
I don't see it as their fault unless

3104.45 --> 3110.7799999999997
they just go so incredibly for that they

3108.15 --> 3113.82
are evil manipulative maniacs and

3110.78 --> 3116.6400000000003
unrelenting and all that but yeah that's

3113.82 --> 3118.4100000000003
a matter that that'll show itself soon

3116.64 --> 3121.98
enough and then everybody does respond

3118.41 --> 3126.7799999999997
to it you know but I don't know people

3121.98 --> 3131.7
gay people they I've met gay people that

3126.78 --> 3133.98
were very nice like very careful with

3131.7 --> 3137.46
other people and I've met gay people

3133.98 --> 3140.52
that are like oh draw out drama queens

3137.46 --> 3143.82
and [ __ ] there are all kinds and I don't

3140.52 --> 3148.08

3143.82 --> 3151.55
like get really gay sexual and frolic II

3148.08 --> 3157.43

3151.55 --> 3162.4700000000003
yeah I don't like that you know but

3157.43 --> 3164.8399999999997
I don't know it's like to me it's it's

3162.47 --> 3167.2099999999996
almost like hey if you're gay I have no

3164.84 --> 3170.6600000000003
problem with that just don't put it

3167.21 --> 3179.78
extra gay on top you know like that that

3170.66 --> 3180.97
is it pretty much I don't mind and in a

3179.78 --> 3185.53
funny way

3180.97 --> 3192.47
well my landlord is like he's gay yeah

3185.53 --> 3195.02
but is behavior the way he conducts

3192.47 --> 3196.6699999999996
himself it doesn't really show like he

3195.02 --> 3199.82
is like super gay

3196.67 --> 3201.92
no he he kind of behaves himself more in

3199.82 --> 3204.53
a gentlemanly way or he tries you know

3201.92 --> 3208.2200000000003
is what he actually does makes him more

3204.53 --> 3211.0400000000004
makes him a big damage but yeah you know

3208.22 --> 3214.0699999999997
he has issues to deal with himself but

3211.04 --> 3216.13
the way he conducts himself socially

3214.07 --> 3220.09
doesn't make me want to throw up

3216.13 --> 3223.1600000000003
