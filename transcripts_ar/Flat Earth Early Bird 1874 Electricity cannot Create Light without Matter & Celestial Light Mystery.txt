220.64 --> 223.64
try

228.36 --> 234.20000000000002
anyhow yeah it seems to be like a Rowdy

231.28 --> 237.159
day like even Quantum of conscious like

234.2 --> 241.28
had just uploaded this

237.159 --> 245.519
video he was getting

241.28 --> 248.599
all haunted and all that well haunted he

245.519 --> 252.28
was just really annoyed by like Society

248.599 --> 252.28
breaking down around him pretty

252.64 --> 257.31899999999996
much busy right now just listening oh

weird like he got really sick but uh

281.52 --> 285.35999999999996
eventually he recovered but I had to

283.199 --> 287.72
like carry him over to his own bed and

285.36 --> 293.36
everything because he couldn't even

287.72 --> 296.36
walk so yeah trying new medication

293.36 --> 299.759
always a good reason to never ever try

296.36 --> 302.199
any medication ever oh we got this new

299.759 --> 306.36
thing oh it might work for this

302.199 --> 306.36

England eating watermelons all over the

513.919 --> 518.5989999999999

white people but if you'd ask it like oh

518.599 --> 522.0390000000001

1229.52 --> 1233.32
interesting about it like every time you

1231.159 --> 1235.4

1233.32 --> 1237.24
to just figure out like what is it that

you're looking at are you looking at

1237.24 --> 1244.44

3D print that they

1244.44 --> 1250.0
rendered like in the 70s or

1247.64 --> 1251.48
something or are you looking at like

1250.0 --> 1254.28
newer

1251.48 --> 1257.84
Graphics of the Moon surface or are you

1254.28 --> 1260.72
looking at actual filmed area or like a

1257.84 --> 1262.3999999999999
mini Minature cuz they do that too like

1260.72 --> 1263.4
that's kind of interesting about yes I

1262.4 --> 1266.4
got your

1263.4 --> 1266.4
email

1269.08 --> 1273.0
thanks oh wow it's

1273.88 --> 1276.88
just

1278.44 --> 1284.0800000000002
okay wow literally you just like click

1281.559 --> 1286.6789999999999
the link and you can just play the movie

1284.08 --> 1286.6789999999999
what what the

1287.039 --> 1290.039
hell

1292.52 --> 1297.279
you want dra no I already had that on

1294.64 --> 1297.279
DVD

1305.44 --> 1310.919
thanks isn't technology cool that all

1308.48 --> 1314.3600000000001
depends on whether it's legal I mean I

1310.919 --> 1314.3600000000001
don't know if they

1314.679 --> 1319.4
act they might get you on something with

1317.2 --> 1322.0800000000002
it cuz I mean I don't think that's

1319.4 --> 1325.3200000000002
actually legal to just do that but I

1322.08 --> 1325.32
mean yes it is kind of

1325.36 --> 1329.84
cool they all want to lure you on the

1327.679 --> 1331.3200000000002
cloud so that if you then say something

1329.84 --> 1332.6399999999999
wrong they can just [ __ ] with you and

1331.32 --> 1336.9189999999999
there's nothing you can do and all your

1332.64 --> 1338.96
data is lost so good luck with the great

1336.919 --> 1340.96
advantages of technology that

1338.96 --> 1342.8400000000001
specifically are great in a very

1340.96 --> 1346.8400000000001
specific corner where you become

1342.84 --> 1349.9599999999998
completely dependent on them yes enjoy

1346.84 --> 1349.9599999999998
the technology

1356.159 --> 1361.96
legal I own the

1358.96 --> 1361.96
movie

1364.039 --> 1369.24
okay I don't know if they really care

1367.08 --> 1372.76
about if you've bought

1369.24 --> 1373.84
something but I'm not sure whatever I'll

1372.76 --> 1379.96
leave it to

1373.84 --> 1379.9599999999998
you it's your Google Drive

1389.72 --> 1395.51
they have bigger frish to fry until they

1392.37 --> 1395.51
[Music]

1397.0 --> 1401.4
don't right they might just send you a

1399.4 --> 1402.76
bill all of a sudden you never really

1401.4 --> 1407.0
know for

1402.76 --> 1409.52
sure these uh super big tech companies

1407.0 --> 1413.159
are becoming quite unreliable and

1409.52 --> 1415.799
unstable and thuggish so you literally

1413.159 --> 1415.7990000000002
never really

1416.24 --> 1422.88
know anyway hello duper sorry not saying

1420.44 --> 1422.88
hello to

1436.88 --> 1439.88
you

1442.81 --> 1446.26
[Applause]

1448.32 --> 1452.039
guess what you stumbled upon while

1449.96 --> 1454.3600000000001
learning

1452.039 --> 1457.52
programming something else that didn't

1454.36 --> 1459.559
relate to programming and distracted you

1457.52 --> 1463.12
again let me

1459.559 --> 1463.12
guess right am I

1466.799 --> 1473.32
right

1469.12 --> 1476.2399999999998
what why you bringing him up Rin Barry I

1473.32 --> 1476.24
don't appreciate

1477.48 --> 1480.48
that

1480.6 --> 1485.9599999999998
yeah I have no idea about any of that

1483.44 --> 1488.96
it's none of my business I never really

1485.96 --> 1488.96
cared in the first

1492.24 --> 1496.76
place as I was quite honest about at the

1495.679 --> 1499.1200000000001
time

1496.76 --> 1501.52
so

1499.12 --> 1502.8799999999999
yeah and he's not going to come in CU he

1501.52 --> 1506.1589999999999
is

1502.88 --> 1509.88
just out there being a total gamma and

1506.159 --> 1512.88
being continually whining so I don't

1509.88 --> 1512.88
want him in here any

1521.559 --> 1526.6789999999999
anymore you have to find it at the Flat

1524.84 --> 1528.6399999999999
Earth debates chat he seems to now

1526.679 --> 1530.76
really love hang around there and has

1528.64 --> 1533.919
like special protection from Paula since

1530.76 --> 1536.8799999999999
he's now just like sucking up to

1533.919 --> 1539.0800000000002
her

1536.88 --> 1541.8400000000001
blatantly I'm sure he's now all of a

1539.08 --> 1546.72
suddenly completely reborn Christian or

1541.84 --> 1546.72
something even though he clearly

1551.559 --> 1556.6789999999999
wasn't what's wrong what do you mean

1554.72 --> 1558.27
what's

1556.679 --> 1561.39
wrong

1558.27 --> 1561.3899999999999
[Music]

1562.48 --> 1566.279
I put the word Global in programming

1564.84 --> 1570.48
yeah no [ __ ]

1566.279 --> 1570.48
derer I mean why wouldn't

1586.6 --> 1589.6
they

1590.24 --> 1595.159
but I mean it sounds like duper is just

1592.08 --> 1597.72
having a a basic Flat Earth realization

1595.159 --> 1600.64
I mean yeah you start to notice those

1597.72 --> 1604.08
things and it's stup I mean there's no

1600.64 --> 1607.96
place where it's not just a heads up

1604.08 --> 1610.6399999999999
like it that is literally Everything You

1607.96 --> 1615.919
Touch

1610.64 --> 1618.0800000000002
everything so yeah welcome to Flat Earth

1615.919 --> 1621.2
you will start to see like how literally

1618.08 --> 1623.399
there is just Pro programming and lies

1621.2 --> 1626.279
in absolutely everything and you'll

1623.399 --> 1629.9189999999999
never unsee it

1626.279 --> 1631.64
again so I I recommend to just not worry

1629.919 --> 1633.8400000000001
about it I mean there's literally

1631.64 --> 1636.5590000000002
nothing you could do there's no point in

1633.84 --> 1639.12
complaining about it to

1636.559 --> 1641.36
anybody right unless you have like a

1639.12 --> 1643.6399999999999
baller that's going to debate with you

1641.36 --> 1643.6399999999999
or

1646.52 --> 1650.399
something

1648.08 --> 1652.6789999999999
and then you could say like

1650.399 --> 1654.84
oh

1652.679 --> 1656.799
atmosphere there doesn't take the shape

1654.84 --> 1659.1589999999999
of the sphere that kind of thing but I

1656.799 --> 1661.9189999999999
mean in general don't wor you just

1659.159 --> 1665.2
shouldn't burden yourself with worrying

1661.919 --> 1668.64
about the programming that's in every in

1665.2 --> 1668.64
all language

1671.76 --> 1676.519
so Global means available everywhere

1674.6 --> 1679.519
well that's what they made it

1676.519 --> 1679.519
mean

1682.32 --> 1688.799
and it does have to do with the shape of

1684.2 --> 1691.919
the Earth or rather the the counter

1688.799 --> 1693.6399999999999
psychology yeah if you just put the word

1691.919 --> 1696.0800000000002
globe and Global and everything and it's

1693.64 --> 1700.24
all all free and connected it's all good

1696.08 --> 1700.24
things see see what that

1702.0 --> 1706.159
does programming through

1706.44 --> 1712.64
Association it's very much

1710.159 --> 1714.3600000000001
programming and it absolutely does have

1712.64 --> 1716.72
to do with the shape of the earth it's

1714.36 --> 1719.32
just that the people that use it don't

1716.72 --> 1719.32
realize

1722.559 --> 1728.76
that it is a bad thing in programming

1725.399 --> 1728.76
never use Global that's

1736.399 --> 1739.399
hilarious

1747.32 --> 1753.1589999999999
right that's that's a that's really

1750.12 --> 1758.4399999999998
funny I mean that sounds like a

1753.159 --> 1758.44
typical typical ironic twist in

1758.919 --> 1767.0
reality it is what newbie programmers do

1763.799 --> 1769.24
ha no I get it though I get that like

1767.0 --> 1770.96
yeah if you like open-ended have

1769.24 --> 1773.0
something available it's basically like

1770.96 --> 1775.64
a leaking thing

1773.0 --> 1778.399
and hacking issues

1775.64 --> 1781.8400000000001
ETC and you want like information

1778.399 --> 1784.279
transfers to be encoded basically so

1781.84 --> 1786.32
that's specific sent and specific

1784.279 --> 1789.919
received and any Outsider can't just

1786.32 --> 1792.36
scoop it up and go Rogue with it so I

1789.919 --> 1792.3600000000001
understand the

1796.32 --> 1799.32
concept

1804.2 --> 1808.24
because you just gave me some basic

1805.84 --> 1810.08
pointers and I I understand the

1808.24 --> 1812.159
implications because I can naturally

1810.08 --> 1815.799
figure it out on the spot because that's

1812.159 --> 1815.7990000000002
how I figure things out and it

1823.159 --> 1829.24
works hello by the way

1826.24 --> 1829.24
mtrc

1845.62 --> 1852.039
[Music]

1847.96 --> 1852.039
right not a security

1856.24 --> 1859.24
thing

1861.76 --> 1870.08
okay well within the program then I

1865.0 --> 1870.08
guess a leak like how would you regard

1872.639 --> 1883.1589999999999
it 65% okay that's

1877.0 --> 1886.36
funny yeah dude like I never

1883.159 --> 1890.0800000000002
really went beyond really figuring out

1886.36 --> 1893.08
prog like computer programming like

1890.08 --> 1893.08
after

1893.799 --> 1899.72
2004 2004 I already concluded like I

1896.96 --> 1902.519
don't want to get in it's like it's just

1899.72 --> 1904.84
this runaway development and I'm sick of

1902.519 --> 1905.72
it I'm sick of trying to keep figuring

1904.84 --> 1908.08
things

1905.72 --> 1911.279
out about

1908.08 --> 1913.32
it so I I who knows what has been

1911.279 --> 1915.159
developed and all like I've just

1913.32 --> 1916.8799999999999
naturally expected like okay they're

1915.159 --> 1917.8400000000001
going to just modularize everything

1916.88 --> 1921.0800000000002
because

1917.84 --> 1923.72
that's logical and in a way like even

1921.08 --> 1927.48
chat GPT and all these systems they are

1923.72 --> 1929.88
like modules they are modularizing

1927.48 --> 1932.6390000000001
everything so in a way my prediction has

1929.88 --> 1932.6390000000001
to come true

1934.88 --> 1942.48
but should coin a new term

1939.48 --> 1942.48
plol

1944.159 --> 1949.0800000000002
no it's called planar

1953.679 --> 1959.24
and that has already different types of

1956.0 --> 1962.24
name yeah there's cultural

1959.24 --> 1962.24
associations

1962.44 --> 1970.48
right but I mean it is literally called

1965.72 --> 1970.48
planar with an R

1976.039 --> 1979.039
ironically

1981.919 --> 1984.279
no

1995.639 --> 2002.519
duper yeah lame don't listen to him

1999.48 --> 2002.519
Friday shut the hell

2005.96 --> 2008.96
up

2010.32 --> 2014.12
sock account anyway get the [ __ ]

2015.679 --> 2019.6390000000001
out stop talking to

2028.559 --> 2034.6789999999999
duper so yeah duper it isn't there is a

2031.84 --> 2037.1589999999999
word for it it's called

2034.679 --> 2040.3990000000001
playar don't listen to idiots it's

2037.159 --> 2043.519
trying to program you with nonsense stop

2040.399 --> 2043.5189999999998
being so goddamn

2045.75 --> 2048.89
[Music]

2065.879 --> 2068.879
gullible

2086.72 --> 2091.4399999999996
could be 75 above

2095.879 --> 2098.879
okay

2103.56 --> 2108.2
right but I mean what would it even end

2105.64 --> 2110.96
up doing then buckbuster wouldn't it

2108.2 --> 2112.3199999999997
just like take some standard mini

2110.96 --> 2115.96
Adventure or

2112.32 --> 2118.56
something and then just replace the the

2115.96 --> 2118.56
words

2119.119 --> 2124.96
and with whatever duper is going to

2121.64 --> 2127.48
insert like as the cultural

2124.96 --> 2129.92
blueprint but I mean you just be playing

2127.48 --> 2132.359
an old video game with like different

2129.92 --> 2136.88
words in it or something I mean it

2132.359 --> 2136.88
wouldn't be like really

2141.48 --> 2144.839
spectacular I don't

2144.96 --> 2151.48
know but I mean yeah

2147.4 --> 2151.48
duper maybe he could try

2154.359 --> 2160.4
it I don't know

2157.64 --> 2160.4
I mean it's his

2164.69 --> 2167.8
[Music]

2171.47 --> 2174.93
[Music]

2185.72 --> 2188.72
project

2209.96 --> 2212.96
H

2214.76 --> 2221.3590000000004
okay Stitch things together that sounds

2217.88 --> 2221.359
like the complicated part

2245.599 --> 2248.599
though

2260.14 --> 2263.17
[Music]

2273.2 --> 2276.9199999999996
no more need for programmers it will all

2275.04 --> 2281.2799999999997
be about the designer well well that

2276.92 --> 2283.64
would be very interesting for me

2281.28 --> 2287.52
personally if that if that kind of thing

2283.64 --> 2287.52
arrives then then maybe I

2288.28 --> 2293.52
would maybe I would try it

2291.04 --> 2295.44
out what I mean by that time there will

2293.52 --> 2299.079
be like courses everywhere and like how

2295.44 --> 2301.52
to use J GPT so it's like or whatever

2299.079 --> 2303.6400000000003
it's going to be called and then

2301.52 --> 2306.16
eventually I might be like okay well

2303.64 --> 2307.96
yeah I got this super elaborate game

2306.16 --> 2310.96
idea

2307.96 --> 2310.96
yeah

2311.119 --> 2315.7200000000003
uh maybe I could be able to use

2330.18 --> 2333.3199999999997
[Music]

2335.52 --> 2338.52
that

2354.92 --> 2358.96
C you will be retired before your job is

2362.8 --> 2368.44
obsolete well I don't think it'll ever

2365.079 --> 2368.44
be completely obsolete

2376.48 --> 2381.2
like there's always going to be more

2378.24 --> 2383.64
issues like things will break down

2381.2 --> 2388.2799999999997
things won't

2383.64 --> 2388.2799999999997
be I don't think they'll ever get to the

2388.839 --> 2393.48
100% like they might keep pushing it but

2391.44 --> 2395.2000000000003
eventually it's like those few percents

2393.48 --> 2398.359
will become like more and

2395.2 --> 2401.359
more a essential and

2398.359 --> 2401.359
necessary

2403.04 --> 2407.68
so like it I don't think it really

2414.0 --> 2418.52
works why hire somebody that's with 40

2417.04 --> 2420.599
years of experience when you can hire

2418.52 --> 2422.8
somebody out of school well because

2420.599 --> 2425.3590000000004
somebody with 40 years experience is

2422.8 --> 2427.76
going to be very thorough about

2425.359 --> 2432.04
it

2427.76 --> 2432.0400000000004
and has more honor in the game that's

2433.0 --> 2442.359
why they have a reputation to so to

2439.319 --> 2444.079
protect I hope yeah well hey if you're

2442.359 --> 2446.48
going to assume like oh nobody cares

2444.079 --> 2448.8390000000004
about anything anymore then I mean Get

2446.48 --> 2451.4
Ready for War then

2448.839 --> 2453.96
because if you really they're coming for

2451.4 --> 2455.319
everything like everyone all people will

2453.96 --> 2458.319
be

2455.319 --> 2458.319
exterminated

2459.96 --> 2464.119
yeah that's the alternative

2464.8 --> 2469.88
route yeah that like I mean if you

2467.319 --> 2472.359
really think you're become obsolete well

2469.88 --> 2474.2000000000003
in that case then there's only one

2472.359 --> 2477.7999999999997
reason to that and that's to get you out

2474.2 --> 2477.7999999999997
of the way as in not living

2479.16 --> 2485.24
anymore that's why things are made

2481.88 --> 2488.2400000000002
obsolete it's to get rid of

2485.24 --> 2492.8799999999997
them

2488.24 --> 2492.8799999999997
so just don't go with that at

2493.0 --> 2498.68
all realize that it doesn't

2500.52 --> 2509.52
work and like you have to be in that

2504.319 --> 2513.0
sphere of knowing in that feel of

2509.52 --> 2515.52
knowing have to just realize the reality

2513.0 --> 2520.359
about what it is to be a human being and

2515.52 --> 2520.359
have actual knowledge versus a bunch of

2521.16 --> 2526.52
computers yeah and hey oh you could get

2524.04 --> 2531.119
hire the kid in school yeah oh like

2526.52 --> 2534.599
cheap Outsourcing of Labor H that's

2531.119 --> 2537.56
never been done before yeah it's been

2534.599 --> 2540.52
done forever and it always has

2537.56 --> 2543.52
consequences yeah and it's a very

2540.52 --> 2546.72
typical Universal type of track record

2543.52 --> 2549.88
as in yeah you want a cheap

2546.72 --> 2549.8799999999997
it's going to be

2550.16 --> 2556.48
[ __ ]

2552.92 --> 2559.319
yeah that's a universal rule that goes

2556.48 --> 2559.319
back to

2559.559 --> 2566.7200000000003
Antiquity so don't think about this oh

2562.88 --> 2566.7200000000003
they're going to I'm going to be

2569.319 --> 2574.52
outdated you only get outdated when you

2571.72 --> 2574.52
choose to become

2575.16 --> 2578.16
outdated

2586.119 --> 2592.839
yeah it's just like this crazy idea that

2588.88 --> 2598.4
like oh oh my God psychologist are in

2592.839 --> 2601.48
danger because there's so much good AI

2598.4 --> 2604.559
communication then oh before you know it

2601.48 --> 2607.359
you'll have ai

2604.559 --> 2609.2000000000003
psychologist and and they will like know

2607.359 --> 2611.359
everything and they will never make a

2609.2 --> 2614.48
mistake you're really going to believe

2611.359 --> 2619.52
that right you believe that people are

2614.48 --> 2624.52
going to like get healthier get

2619.52 --> 2626.839
better mentally by chatting with a

2624.52 --> 2629.359
[Music]

2626.839 --> 2632.52
robot you think that's going to actually

2629.359 --> 2637.2799999999997
work like this entire idea of like

2632.52 --> 2639.96
robots replacing everything is [ __ ]

2637.28 --> 2641.1600000000003
it's like claiming that Aron has the

2639.96 --> 2644.44
power of

2641.16 --> 2647.0
Christ it it really is it the

2644.44 --> 2649.16
metaphorically symbolically that is what

2647.0 --> 2651.44
that is it's

2649.16 --> 2655.68
ridiculous it's nothing like that it's

2651.44 --> 2658.559
just a hollow skin It All Soul Spirit

2655.68 --> 2661.8799999999997
quality it all goes away you just have

2658.559 --> 2661.88
to realize that about

2665.0 --> 2668.0
it

2694.96 --> 2697.96
what

2705.88 --> 2711.44
year

2707.4 --> 2715.28
2035 things [ __ ] things up

2711.44 --> 2717.28
what no what it'll do is it'll just make

2715.28 --> 2720.1600000000003
what's really going to happen eventually

2717.28 --> 2722.8
is that finances will become completely

2720.16 --> 2726.3999999999996
outdated they will be so desperate to

2722.8 --> 2729.8390000000004
just gain control of everybody so

2726.4 --> 2732.28
devious and devilishly that they will

2729.839 --> 2734.319
literally make themselves completely

2732.28 --> 2736.2400000000002
outdated and Superfluous that's what's

2734.319 --> 2739.64
really going to happen yeah this is my

2736.24 --> 2741.9199999999996
arnian bizarre prediction it's like what

2739.64 --> 2745.839
but that's exactly the opposite of

2741.92 --> 2745.839
everything we're anticipating

2746.44 --> 2749.44
yeah

2749.559 --> 2754.3190000000004
yeah the further the banks go in trying

2752.319 --> 2756.2799999999997
to mind control and mess everything up

2754.319 --> 2758.72
and get everybody killed the more more

2756.28 --> 2760.96
money will become completely outdated

2758.72 --> 2764.2
eventually like people will start to

2760.96 --> 2769.119
recognize that good spirit and loyalty

2764.2 --> 2772.3999999999996
and just good values labor all

2769.119 --> 2775.48
that that that is like the only thing

2772.4 --> 2777.839
that actually matters because money is

2775.48 --> 2781.079
of the devil and they will literally

2777.839 --> 2784.5589999999997
just promise you things not even give it

2781.079 --> 2788.1600000000003
rip you off steal it back from

2784.559 --> 2790.0400000000004
you like all they do is that it's all

2788.16 --> 2793.319
about the loot it's all looting the

2790.04 --> 2796.319
banking is just looting the

2793.319 --> 2798.96
people that's what is effectively

2796.319 --> 2802.96
happening they consolidate and then they

2798.96 --> 2802.96
ruin things it's a

2805.839 --> 2809.68
strategy and it's very

2810.599 --> 2815.3590000000004
evil and they're doing it it's already

2814.0 --> 2817.64
happening it's been happening and it's

2815.359 --> 2820.119
getting worse and it's going to get way

2817.64 --> 2822.5589999999997
worse but what it's going to lead to is

2820.119 --> 2825.359
not people giving up their souls like

2822.559 --> 2828.0400000000004
people are going to literally give up

2825.359 --> 2831.5989999999997
the backs

2828.04 --> 2834.88
like because I'm already at that point

2831.599 --> 2837.8
I'm like burn it all

2834.88 --> 2841.1600000000003
down and I mean like oh but all their

2837.8 --> 2844.7200000000003
wealth oh we need no like burn it all

2841.16 --> 2846.72
down like [ __ ] all of

2844.72 --> 2849.64
that

2846.72 --> 2853.04
just nullify it like nothing there is

2849.64 --> 2856.2799999999997
nothing they have nothing we don't need

2853.04 --> 2859.119
anything from them like get the [ __ ] out

2856.28 --> 2862.28
there's nothing for you here no money

2859.119 --> 2862.28
nothing get

2862.72 --> 2868.3999999999996
out no more

2864.96 --> 2868.4
exploitation only

2871.68 --> 2877.96
labor yeah no more individuals

2874.72 --> 2881.1189999999997
determining how things work with their

2877.96 --> 2881.119
money at

2888.2 --> 2892.839
all because this can't continue like

2890.88 --> 2894.44
this kind of setup and black rock

2892.839 --> 2895.96
consolidating everything eating

2894.44 --> 2897.599
everything up and then making it

2895.96 --> 2902.96
horrendous and

2897.599 --> 2906.48
evil and bad disfunctional Bad Evil

2902.96 --> 2910.48
terrible they're already like swallow up

2906.48 --> 2914.359
everything but like that can't

2910.48 --> 2914.359
last they can't

2919.92 --> 2926.28
win because it just makes everything

2922.92 --> 2928.839
dysfunctional and then it will

2926.28 --> 2931.2000000000003
collapse yeah them making the things

2928.839 --> 2933.359
dysfunctional they do it out of

2931.2 --> 2936.4399999999996
cheapness and because they're

2933.359 --> 2938.4
megalomaniacal about it and because of

2936.44 --> 2941.319
the pressure on the people strategy

2938.4 --> 2943.1600000000003
hoping that more will break like burst

2941.319 --> 2945.359
open and then they can just suck up

2943.16 --> 2948.5989999999997
everything out of it

2945.359 --> 2951.04
right literally squeeze people to death

2948.599 --> 2955.3590000000004
just to like suck them

2951.04 --> 2957.96
dry but eventually

2955.359 --> 2961.0
like it will become just blatantly

2957.96 --> 2963.48
apparent that they are like just

2961.0 --> 2964.28
dysfunctional and they are like breaking

2963.48 --> 2967.16
the

2964.28 --> 2970.0400000000004
law with everything and then it will

2967.16 --> 2973.44
have to dissipate like Black Rock will

2970.04 --> 2973.44
have to be

2975.119 --> 2981.2000000000003
disintegrated and

2977.359 --> 2984.52
forbidden yeah entirely I mean it will

2981.2 --> 2986.4399999999996
effectively be the complete making

2984.52 --> 2991.04
illegal of

2986.44 --> 2991.04
Usery which is what is causing Black

2994.52 --> 2999.0
Rock

2996.16 --> 3002.359
like it has to be made illegal like no

2999.0 --> 3002.359
more like at

3014.0 --> 3019.599
all and I mean probably even gambling on

3018.119 --> 3022.6400000000003
top of

3019.599 --> 3027.48
that cuz it should be it should be made

3022.64 --> 3031.0
illegal to like be able to just lose

3027.48 --> 3034.72
assets to foreign powers like that like

3031.0 --> 3034.72
it should be absolutely

3035.319 --> 3043.72
illegal no more meddling no more Foreign

3039.079 --> 3047.2400000000002
Affairs no more non governmental

3043.72 --> 3047.24
organizations that kind of

3049.92 --> 3058.2000000000003
thing and black rock o owns the

3054.44 --> 3060.76
politicians yeah well Revolution that's

3058.2 --> 3060.7599999999998
only one

3064.799 --> 3070.4
way hello Richie G good to see you slowo

3068.2 --> 3070.3999999999996
moon

3084.359 --> 3087.359
buggy

3092.64 --> 3099.4
[Music]

3121.52 --> 3127.16
all right but I mean like these

3123.559 --> 3129.92
politicians doing all this black rock

3127.16 --> 3131.92
things doing all that I mean they are

3129.92 --> 3133.64
criminals they and they're are doing

3131.92 --> 3135.28
criminal things they are getting caught

3133.64 --> 3137.04
doing criminal things all over the place

3135.28 --> 3139.3590000000004
it's all a matter of like making the

3137.04 --> 3142.48
move replacing

3139.359 --> 3145.799
it and then making the laws that

3142.48 --> 3148.28
literally make it illegal

3145.799 --> 3150.599
and that hold the banks the task like

3148.28 --> 3153.44
yeah those supposed things that you're

3150.599 --> 3153.44
doing that's

3167.72 --> 3172.68
illegal and would have to be written

3170.44 --> 3172.68
very

3174.24 --> 3177.24
carefully

3182.0 --> 3187.04
objective loss you're yeah you're

3184.04 --> 3189.64
talking about the United States now

3187.04 --> 3191.5589999999997
right Gavin B I mean the United States

3189.64 --> 3195.0
is like a

3191.559 --> 3197.52
whole whole another level of that I mean

3195.0 --> 3199.599
I don't I literally don't know I mean I

3197.52 --> 3202.24
I get the feeling like it just they're

3199.599 --> 3203.96
just pushing it to just blow it up

3202.24 --> 3206.0
they're just pushing everything around

3203.96 --> 3208.96
until they basically

3206.0 --> 3212.359
get a massive missile strike or

3208.96 --> 3212.359
something and it like blows

3214.2 --> 3219.48
up I mean it doesn't look like anybody

3217.359 --> 3222.44
in the United States is going to do

3219.48 --> 3226.119
anything about the government at all

3222.44 --> 3229.2000000000003
except just yell try to void vote get

3226.119 --> 3232.88
get their vote stolen get continually

3229.2 --> 3236.24
stolen harassed fake trials all the time

3232.88 --> 3238.7200000000003
I mean nobody's going to actually stop

3236.24 --> 3241.9599999999996
it nobody's going to actually pull that

3238.72 --> 3245.5589999999997
Revolution that is quite

3241.96 --> 3247.559
overdue so it's probably going to keep

3245.559 --> 3252.119
running until it blows

3247.559 --> 3254.4
up until an outsider probably Russia and

3252.119 --> 3257.319
Coalition is going to literally like

3254.4 --> 3260.28
okay we're going to now blow

3257.319 --> 3262.2
up the core of this problem the thing

3260.28 --> 3264.079
that is making everything so terrible

3262.2 --> 3265.14
around the

3264.079 --> 3268.3
world

3265.14 --> 3268.2999999999997
[Music]

3270.52 --> 3274.72
is politicians not corrupt yeah it

3276.44 --> 3281.52
is but I mean they're not even really

3279.319 --> 3281.52
the

3283.04 --> 3289.68
government like there is like provable

3286.64 --> 3292.8799999999997
criminal activity happening like it's

3289.68 --> 3292.8799999999997
already been proven

3293.599 --> 3299.6800000000003
like I'm just just baffled they aren't

3296.88 --> 3301.96
literally in jail yet for it cuz they

3299.68 --> 3306.0
should

3301.96 --> 3308.559
be they should just be like yeah now

3306.0 --> 3310.839
arrest them put the cops on them and in

3308.559 --> 3315.7200000000003
the police car and then they go to jail

3310.839 --> 3315.72
like yeah they got everything they

3324.0 --> 3327.0
need

3339.48 --> 3343.599
One World corporate cost go

3354.0 --> 3357.0
government

3362.559 --> 3365.96
want to move to Missouri

3367.599 --> 3374.6800000000003
yeah it looked really cool in Benjamin's

3371.4 --> 3378.1600000000003
videos about it with

3374.68 --> 3378.16

3441.2 --> 3446.799
many people here right

3443.799 --> 3446.799
now

3447.68 --> 3453.24
must be

3448.76 --> 3455.039
because I'm so favored by YouTube they

3453.24 --> 3457.8799999999997
love me so

3455.039 --> 3461.6400000000003
much that I'm getting the cloud from

3457.88 --> 3465.2000000000003
YouTube because I am secretly of the

3461.64 --> 3465.2
devil didn't you

3465.28 --> 3470.2400000000002
know that's why I'm getting so many

3468.44 --> 3474.2000000000003
views and

3470.24 --> 3475.64
watches cuz I'm favored by YouTube you

3474.2 --> 3479.52
really believe that

3475.64 --> 3481.92
that some people actually do and can't

3479.52 --> 3485.88
believe it that they

3481.92 --> 3485.88
would slide so

3490.76 --> 3496.44
deep when I'm pretty sure that the

3493.4 --> 3500.2400000000002
people here have all found me through

3496.44 --> 3502.839
other places like I don't typically get

3500.24 --> 3503.72
recommended except maybe for what was

3502.839 --> 3506.72
his

3503.72 --> 3506.72
name

3511.76 --> 3516.2000000000003
uh

3513.52 --> 3518.44
Fredo Fredo apparently searched Flat

3516.2 --> 3522.48
Earth and found me he did never really

3518.44 --> 3522.48
elaborate on that after that

3526.2 --> 3532.96
point maybe he's his attention span is

3529.76 --> 3534.599
are too short so he just left again cuz

3532.96 --> 3538.44
we're not like oh Flat Earth and he's

3534.599 --> 3541.079
not not seeing all moving images off FL

3538.44 --> 3543.359
ason it's moving it's moving otherwise

3541.079 --> 3545.319
oh it gets so boring my attention span

3543.359 --> 3548.359
can't handle it unless there constant

3545.319 --> 3553.52
Hassle and noise

3548.359 --> 3556.64
and yeah I'm sorry then this is not your

3553.52 --> 3559.96
show I'm sorry and I not like this

3556.64 --> 3561.52
insane hyperactive clown that's just

3559.96 --> 3564.76
never ending

3561.52 --> 3566.72
yelling and always like agitating agit

3564.76 --> 3571.2000000000003
dating AG because I know that's what

3566.72 --> 3571.2
you're all so used to out

3572.44 --> 3578.4
there I'm actually here to give you an

3575.559 --> 3578.4
exception to

3593.64 --> 3596.64
that

3618.119 --> 3623.559
guardian angels are demonic well he

3619.96 --> 3625.28
didn't say that that overtly he didn't

3623.559 --> 3628.1600000000003
well as far as I know

3625.28 --> 3630.92
I don't know exactly what he said

3628.16 --> 3630.92
slow-mo moon

3633.24 --> 3638.839
buggy he just said that what I did was

3636.44 --> 3641.559
demonic

3638.839 --> 3644.7599999999998
and even though I invoke the name of

3641.559 --> 3648.76
Jesus Christ literally it's like pretty

3644.76 --> 3652.3190000000004
weird to still think that then like

3648.76 --> 3654.3590000000004
shouldn't that just are you not

3652.319 --> 3656.68
impressed by the power of those words

3654.359 --> 3659.64
and and the influence they had shouldn't

3656.68 --> 3662.0789999999997
you literally like upon hearing that

3659.64 --> 3663.4
just recognize immediately like yeah

3662.079 --> 3665.8390000000004
that can

3663.4 --> 3668.839
be but

3665.839 --> 3670.319
apparently Neil has some really weird

3668.839 --> 3673.44
things I

3670.319 --> 3676.2
mean if he really thinks that then he

3673.44 --> 3678.119
must probably think that I am the

3676.2 --> 3681.5989999999997
Antichrist or

3678.119 --> 3685.28
something cuz how else would you explain

3681.599 --> 3688.92
that that type of thinking like my God

3685.28 --> 3688.92
me little old

3689.24 --> 3692.24
me

3692.319 --> 3700.599
what

3694.359 --> 3700.5989999999997
Q the quantum eraser sample

3713.44 --> 3716.44
what

3727.079 --> 3732.079
I mean in reality I really think it's

3728.76 --> 3734.8390000000004
just jealousy I mean I just healed

3732.079 --> 3739.48
somebody and they just couldn't have it

3734.839 --> 3743.16
it's like how dare you heal somebody

3739.48 --> 3747.079
using the words of Jesus Christ how dare

3743.16 --> 3749.799
you actually be effective at it must be

3747.079 --> 3753.3590000000004
demonic what because it's not supposed

3749.799 --> 3755.88
to work is that what you

3753.359 --> 3759.44
expect when you heal somebody it's not

3755.88 --> 3759.44
supposed to work

3772.44 --> 3778.88
really or is it because I don't call it

3775.52 --> 3781.48
praying cuz it it doesn't seem like that

3778.88 --> 3781.48
is what it

3784.279 --> 3790.64
is it's slightly different maybe that's

3788.119 --> 3795.4
it I don't

3790.64 --> 3795.4
know I'm just really puzzled over all

3803.279 --> 3806.279
that

3827.4 --> 3833.0
oh Nathan had a

3829.559 --> 3835.7200000000003
new video why on live

3833.0 --> 3837.96
shows well undoubtedly it's this

3835.72 --> 3840.839
computer but yeah Nathan's still not

3837.96 --> 3844.319
live still doing premieres which have

3840.839 --> 3847.44
been decently fun like one of the

3844.319 --> 3849.68
premieres everyone just terets there and

3847.44 --> 3851.88
po there and everybody just

3849.68 --> 3855.5989999999997
[Music]

3851.88 --> 3857.6800000000003
whining and other times it's great I

3855.599 --> 3860.119
just hang there and Nathan like chews on

3857.68 --> 3860.1189999999997
somebody

3861.16 --> 3867.7599999999998
else and it's

3863.2 --> 3871.52
fun so yeah I am not back with Nathan

3867.76 --> 3873.6400000000003
Oakley and I'm not like oh I will never

3871.52 --> 3877.799
speak with him again I mean I'm sorry

3873.64 --> 3880.5989999999997
I'm just not on the G+ panel how dare

3877.799 --> 3885.0
me oh that means I can never be in the

3880.599 --> 3885.0
chat again like what is everybody's

3890.4 --> 3896.76
problem I mean they're just desperate it

3894.279 --> 3899.72
everybody just desperate to see us hate

3896.76 --> 3901.48
each other like they just want us to be

3899.72 --> 3903.799
these Petty demons that'll burn

3901.48 --> 3905.16
ourselves up where this pointless

3903.799 --> 3908.079
rivalry or

3905.16 --> 3910.359
something is that what it is because

3908.079 --> 3911.1600000000003
that's what anti flat earther [ __ ]

3910.359 --> 3914.88
would

3911.16 --> 3914.8799999999997
do I just don't get

3915.96 --> 3921.559
it now somebody say something before I

3918.76 --> 3921.559

but all these dumbass meteors fly Ling

3954.48 --> 3959.839
by Earth I'm so sick of those dumbass

3956.839 --> 3959.839
stories it's so

3960.2 --> 3967.41
lame and so incredibly made

3965.359 --> 3970.92
up and

3967.41 --> 3970.92
[Music]

3982.0 --> 3987.92
boring yeah it's very smart C

3989.279 --> 3997.119
be we've thought the short wars were

3991.839 --> 4000.799
pretty gay yeah there you are

3997.119 --> 4000.799
absolutely what what's

4013.0 --> 4016.0
that

4017.76 --> 4024.8390000000004
what a bunch of nonsense and weird all

4021.48 --> 4027.319
size of a peacock oh that I'm sure has

4024.839 --> 4029.44
absolutely nothing to do with Owen

4027.319 --> 4033.0389999999998
Benjamin suddenly getting a

4029.44 --> 4036.039
peacock I bet it has absolutely nothing

4033.039 --> 4036.039
to do with that right

4036.2 --> 4042.48
slow-mo that is

4038.68 --> 4042.48
weird it is

4042.92 --> 4045.92
weird

4052.279 --> 4057.96
sounds like the boys at Nasa are a

4054.4 --> 4060.96
little obsessed with the big

4057.96 --> 4060.96
bear

4061.31 --> 4064.429
[Music]

4072.92 --> 4075.92
weird

4085.48 --> 4092.4
old show is the greatest show

4088.279 --> 4095.0
ever it is very

4092.4 --> 4097.88
impressive and a lot of really

4095.0 --> 4100.4
disgusting people like to like [ __ ] it

4097.88 --> 4104.04
[ __ ] all over it and sit in the chat and

4100.4 --> 4107.12
just be completely deranged freaks just

4104.04 --> 4111.5199999999995
to make everything look

4107.12 --> 4114.08
ugly so yeah there's like really nasty

4111.52 --> 4114.080000000001
dirt

4121.88 --> 4127.719
Gathering but I mean yeah Owen was is a

4124.92 --> 4130.56
it is great he makes good points he has

4127.719 --> 4130.56
hilarious

4131.96 --> 4138.96
things what

4135.56 --> 4138.96
episodes what what does that

4162.719 --> 4165.719
mean

4167.159 --> 4172.639999999999
bigger than Star Wars SL no but it

4174.159 --> 4178.48
is it is bigger than Star

4181.64 --> 4186.400000000001
Wars like Owen gets a lot of

4191.52 --> 4196.6
attention but I mean it's OB obvious

4194.08 --> 4199.48
that numbers are being suppressed and

4196.6 --> 4201.64
there's like algorithm screwing around

4199.48 --> 4205.36
all over the place has been from the

4201.64 --> 4208.360000000001
start since he started going to the

4205.36 --> 4210.199
conspiracy theorist route when he

4208.36 --> 4213.639999999999
started getting kicked

4210.199 --> 4217.32
off to me it is way bigger than Star

4213.64 --> 4217.320000000001
Wars yeah fair

4222.64 --> 4225.64
enough

4226.239 --> 4230.239
it was another era though

4236.239 --> 4243.678999999999
so it was also Star Wars very new new

4241.28 --> 4245.92
and extreme and you got to realize like

4243.679 --> 4248.76
Star Wars like one

4245.92 --> 4251.6
movie everybody was hyped for that for

4248.76 --> 4253.64
like a year or something that om

4251.6 --> 4257.1990000000005
Benjamin is just doing streams every

4253.64 --> 4261.56
every day like you can't really compare

4257.199 --> 4261.5599999999995
it it's a whole different

4264.44 --> 4268.919999999999
game but what he does makes impact

4267.36 --> 4272.44
that's just

4268.92 --> 4272.4400000000005
undeniable it is

4282.56 --> 4286.56
undeniable

4284.28 --> 4289.5599999999995
sign his death word okay that's a bit

4286.56 --> 4291.88
dramatic there Woodwork and gunny bear

4289.56 --> 4296.400000000001
because I've done all those things

4291.88 --> 4296.400000000001
myself and arguably even

4303.0 --> 4306.36
more but

4312.56 --> 4317.6
yeah

4314.36 --> 4317.599999999999
algorithm yeah

4318.36 --> 4323.639
yeah I think I really do think that my

4321.56 --> 4327.52
algorithm is also being suppressed but I

4323.639 --> 4329.96
mean on the other hand I'm kind of okay

4327.52 --> 4331.96
with it weirdly enough because it's like

4329.96 --> 4333.52
I don't think that many people could

4331.96 --> 4336.4800000000005
really handle

4333.52 --> 4339.679
me I think I just caused so much

4336.48 --> 4339.678999999999
friction and [ __ ]

4342.48 --> 4345.48
everywhere

4347.84 --> 4354.28
I'm not really that good with big

4350.719 --> 4356.56
crowds at all much better with like

4354.28 --> 4356.5599999999995
little

4357.48 --> 4364.759999999999
groups but I mean my ideas are just my

4360.639 --> 4364.76
ideas and they have no

4364.88 --> 4370.2390000000005
limits they have no range

4367.56 --> 4371.92
limit it's just that it makes me a

4370.239 --> 4374.5199999999995
little bit uncomfortable being

4371.92 --> 4376.04
surrounded by Gina amounts of people

4374.52 --> 4378.719
especially if they're all having their

4376.04 --> 4378.719
attention on

4378.84 --> 4388.32
me but yeah financially it would

4383.52 --> 4391.159000000001
be a big relief if I had it cuz then I

4388.32 --> 4395.5199999999995
wouldn't have to like hustle so much and

4391.159 --> 4395.5199999999995
like beg for it so

4396.63 --> 4399.779
[Music]

4402.08 --> 4407.5599999999995
much right I mean trolls don't bother

4405.239 --> 4410.28
people that have bigger YouTube channels

4407.56 --> 4412.92
about oh get a job they don't do

4410.28 --> 4416.96
that they never do that because bigger

4412.92 --> 4416.96
channels like they have an income from

4417.159 --> 4423.599999999999
it yeah well it's not given to me they

4420.679 --> 4423.6
ain't giving that to

4427.92 --> 4436.719
me although I am still here and running

4432.12 --> 4436.719
arguably at a very small scale

4437.32 --> 4442.5599999999995
though my subscribers have been kind of

4440.0 --> 4442.56
growing

4445.12 --> 4449.44
though like decently

4458.92 --> 4465.28
steady right I'm already at 80 or TW

4467.28 --> 4474.5599999999995
2854 right now it's never been that

4471.639 --> 4479.1990000000005
high so it is kind of like a growth

4474.56 --> 4479.1990000000005
spurt in a way and I'm very happy about

4481.84 --> 4486.679
that so yeah the way it looks I might

4484.96 --> 4489.12
actually make the

4486.679 --> 4495.28
3,000 this year

4489.12 --> 4495.28
woohoo maybe even this summer who knows

4522.199 --> 4525.199
h

4529.74 --> 4534.139999999999
[Music]

4552.199 --> 4555.199
for

4564.19 --> 4567.57
[Music]

4572.639 --> 4578.4800000000005
what happened to the bear guy what bear

4575.36 --> 4578.48
guy are you talking about

4582.12 --> 4585.12
duper

4599.8 --> 4605.52
oh gentle bear guy because there's also

4602.199 --> 4605.5199999999995
Woodwork and gunny bear

4612.08 --> 4615.08
so

4622.2 --> 4625.33
[Music]

4635.04 --> 4642.0
right I really got back into hamburgers

4637.28 --> 4643.96
by the way for food recently it's weird

4642.0 --> 4646.4
cuz I had a whole period where I just

4643.96 --> 4648.12
didn't want that but now it's like

4646.4 --> 4651.719
really appealing

4648.12 --> 4654.28
recently and financially it works out

4651.719 --> 4654.28
good as

4659.88 --> 4666.6
well and I I can make one hell of a

4663.639 --> 4669.52
hamburger I mean the bread's not exactly

4666.6 --> 4672.679
a hamburger bun

4669.52 --> 4674.0
but late winter calls for hamburgers

4672.679 --> 4677.56
does it

4674.0 --> 4682.6
it do you have a grill to make your own

4677.56 --> 4682.6
no no I do it in just

4683.719 --> 4688.0
a what do you call that a frying

4694.8 --> 4699.679
pan with like recycled hamburger grease

4698.639 --> 4701.92
that's

4699.679 --> 4704.92
like last

4701.92 --> 4704.92
forever

4707.679 --> 4712.32
I mean it literally lasts

4710.199 --> 4718.4
forever and it's

4712.32 --> 4718.4
great like that Fat's like very

4724.56 --> 4729.52
nourishing for me in late winter I get

4727.44 --> 4731.919999999999
beef gravy okay that's interesting I

4729.52 --> 4734.92
guess I'm having that too for a

4731.92 --> 4734.92
bit

4745.08 --> 4750.48
and have to also be careful because like

4748.4 --> 4752.638999999999
around this period is like tooth AE

4750.48 --> 4756.839999999999
period

4752.639 --> 4756.84
also like May

4756.92 --> 4764.4400000000005
April so

4760.28 --> 4768.08
and uh what do you call it March

4764.44 --> 4771.12
potentially so just got to be careful

4768.08 --> 4773.5599999999995
overall and I'm like dropping the coffee

4771.12 --> 4776.0
that seems to be like a bad influence

4773.56 --> 4776.0
all of a

4786.92 --> 4793.4
sudden oh well that does sound kind of

4790.48 --> 4796.799999999999
nice Woodwork and gy Bear

4793.4 --> 4801.32
egg okay I don't take egg on

4796.8 --> 4801.320000000001
it worest sauce

4807.88 --> 4812.400000000001
okay yeah now but what I use

4813.36 --> 4819.48
is it's really just the beef on bread

4817.159 --> 4823.07
with baked

4819.48 --> 4824.879999999999
onions Chili Pepper sliced

4823.07 --> 4827.5599999999995
[Music]

4824.88 --> 4830.92
uh

4827.56 --> 4833.080000000001
lettuce like half a tomato

4830.92 --> 4836.08
sliced is

4833.08 --> 4837.92
anything yeah and a bunch of sauce so

4836.08 --> 4839.28
like a little bit of chili sauce a

4837.92 --> 4840.96
little bit of ketchup and a little bit

4839.28 --> 4845.759999999999
of

4840.96 --> 4848.04
mayonnaise it's like a whole thing of

4845.76 --> 4851.4400000000005
everything and it's great it does get

4848.04 --> 4851.44
messy though but it's

4851.719 --> 4856.36
great

4854.09 --> 4859.6
[Music]

4856.36 --> 4861.759999999999
and funnily enough it's one of the few

4859.6 --> 4865.320000000001
types of dinners where I actually get

4861.76 --> 4869.1990000000005
like fresh lettuce and ve

4865.32 --> 4869.199
like vegetables like

4869.48 --> 4877.32
that because outside of making

4872.6 --> 4880.08
hamburgers I rarely use those types of

4877.32 --> 4881.639
ingredients so I get more fresh lettuce

4880.08 --> 4883.8
and

4881.639 --> 4885.96
tomato

4883.8 --> 4888.320000000001
than like with any other type of dinner

4885.96 --> 4888.32
that I

4889.88 --> 4895.32
have so yes technically what it comes

4893.08 --> 4898.639
down to is that when I make hamburgers

4895.32 --> 4898.639
it's like health food for

4899.639 --> 4905.8
me eggs hold it together yeah maybe but

4902.76 --> 4908.6
I eat eggs separate though I don't want

4905.8 --> 4910.88
it along so I don't like the combination

4908.6 --> 4910.88
of

4911.639 --> 4914.639
that

4941.56 --> 4944.56
h

4948.32 --> 4954.199
tasty the

4950.88 --> 4954.1990000000005
Patty okay

4971.56 --> 4974.56
maybe

4982.93 --> 4986.229
[Music]

5001.28 --> 5005.96
but I mean I know like you I've seen

5004.08 --> 5008.96
like egg being mixed in with like

5005.96 --> 5008.96
meatloaf and all

5009.56 --> 5016.4400000000005
that so it can be combined it's just I

5013.84 --> 5016.4400000000005
don't do

5019.42 --> 5022.609
[Music]

5025.44 --> 5031.48
that and I'm like very I just I don't

5029.84 --> 5034.4800000000005
like to waste

5031.48 --> 5034.48
anything

5036.84 --> 5042.28
cuz I make dinner for one person and

5039.32 --> 5045.0
then I'm not going to use one

5042.28 --> 5050.719
egg going to not be able to use that all

5045.0 --> 5053.76
up for that one hamburger right so I

5050.719 --> 5056.28
mean maybe if you have a family to feed

5053.76 --> 5059.4800000000005
then that works that that works out with

5056.28 --> 5061.36
the quantities and all that but not the

5059.48 --> 5064.36
way that I

5061.36 --> 5064.36
live

5066.12 --> 5071.199
yeah it does sound like a family thing

5068.36 --> 5071.199
would work in gny

5642.119 --> 5646.159
from what I

5643.719 --> 5647.639
heard when it was still being talked

5646.159 --> 5649.839999999999
about in my

5647.639 --> 5653.639
chat way

5649.84 --> 5657.2390000000005

5728.159 --> 5733.159
nonsense things or Globe things maybe I

5730.88 --> 5737.0
should just like

5733.159 --> 5741.199
start doing that sort of thing

5737.0 --> 5744.84
again why Neil the grass proved corol

5741.199 --> 5744.839999999999
during football game yeah

5750.4 --> 5753.4
right

5769.679 --> 5772.76
a touch okay fair enough Woodwork in

5771.6 --> 5776.84
guny

5772.76 --> 5783.320000000001
Bear maybe maybe it I could think of

5776.84 --> 5783.32
saying it like in Fran or something

5783.639 --> 5792.04
maybe it is a Dutch word it's just very

5787.36 --> 5792.04
localish so it's not like a typical

5795.159 --> 5799.32
word like I could try to like pronounce

5797.92 --> 5802.28
it

5799.32 --> 5805.5599999999995
like

5802.28 --> 5809.5199999999995
abke something like that I don't

5805.56 --> 5812.76
know it's a weird name I do think I've

5809.52 --> 5815.159000000001
heard it before

5812.76 --> 5815.159000000001
but

5815.679 --> 5823.28
uh yeah look I am not really all about

5819.4 --> 5825.5199999999995
the fish anyway like I don't eat fish I

5823.28 --> 5827.96
eat take fish oil I don't eat fish I

5825.52 --> 5827.96

it the A and the E are connected yeah

5838.84 --> 5843.1990000000005
I'm sure they

5840.199 --> 5843.199
are

5846.4 --> 5851.32
that's I was already assuming that it's

5848.92 --> 5854.119
usually like that when the a there's an

5851.32 --> 5854.119
A and then an

5858.159 --> 5865.879999999999
e pancake bow with gem what oh

5870.199 --> 5873.199
okay

5878.0 --> 5880.239
hold on

5900.119 --> 5906.679
on why are so many bald Defenders on

5903.32 --> 5909.759999999999
YouTube bald or trans because space is

5906.679 --> 5909.76
fake and gay

5930.119 --> 5933.119
doons

5957.0 --> 5962.88
that Mak sense yeah it does it

5959.4 --> 5965.879999999999
absolutely does

5962.88 --> 5965.88
there there is it's

5980.32 --> 5986.199
conjoined yeah I mean it it's it's so

5983.32 --> 5988.599
true that to the point sounds weird that

5986.199 --> 5990.04
if NASA and all the space stuff would

5988.599 --> 5993.04
have been like

5990.04 --> 5993.04
more

5993.119 --> 5998.799999999999
homophobic I could guess like if they

5995.48 --> 6001.919999999999
wouldn't have like become all like that

5998.8 --> 6001.92
I might have stayed a

6002.04 --> 6007.119
baller not that I would be like an anti

6004.599 --> 6009.119000000001
flat earther than like the rest of the

6007.119 --> 6011.88
guys but I would have like maybe

6009.119 --> 6014.159
potentially like not done it because

6011.88 --> 6014.159000000001
it's

6015.96 --> 6021.56
like because I'm just trying to find

6018.44 --> 6025.04
some kind of save ground from that crap

6021.56 --> 6027.119000000001
or I was but it was blatantly obvious to

6025.04 --> 6030.48
me like even through visions and all

6027.119 --> 6033.28
that that it was gay and that they would

6030.48 --> 6035.119
eventually just like make it all super

6033.28 --> 6040.239
super

6035.119 --> 6040.239
gay and I can't be part of that I just

6040.639 --> 6045.599
can't I can't be associated with that at

6049.92 --> 6057.52
all sausage part yeah that's not this

6052.76 --> 6057.52
that's not the right words for that

6062.88 --> 6070.84
duper that just means it's all

6066.04 --> 6070.84
male that's has nothing to do with

6073.96 --> 6079.04
that yeah they aren't they are not all

6076.639 --> 6082.28
male it's not all sist party that's

6079.04 --> 6084.599
filled with women

6082.28 --> 6087.04
yeah that's the issue that's where it

6084.599 --> 6088.639
starts and then the gays and the trans

6087.04 --> 6093.239
and everything

6088.639 --> 6093.2390000000005
else and they're [ __ ] all of

6101.36 --> 6106.32
it talking about which have you seen

6103.92 --> 6109.04
that I don't I know I'm kind of nervous

6106.32 --> 6111.759999999999
to even bring it up but I seen some

6109.04 --> 6115.199
crazy ass [ __ ]

6111.76 --> 6120.04
in Ukraine where they're actually

6115.199 --> 6123.759999999999
sending Down syndrome guys to the front

6120.04 --> 6123.76
lines what the

6123.92 --> 6132.56
[ __ ] I would say if it it was funny if

6127.36 --> 6132.5599999999995
it wasn't so horrifying and like

6132.639 --> 6137.159000000001
evil but like on camera and everything

6136.0 --> 6140.639
what the

6137.159 --> 6144.839999999999
hell I was just it was so sickened by

6140.639 --> 6144.84
that I I didn't really want to click it

6146.96 --> 6152.199
but must be getting down yeah no

6156.92 --> 6163.599
anything dud before you know it they'll

6159.44 --> 6168.199
just send mothers in with their babies

6163.599 --> 6168.1990000000005
breastfeeding like they'll send anything

6169.76 --> 6172.76
in

6187.36 --> 6190.44
but yeah that was pretty

6199.679 --> 6202.679
disturbing

6210.4 --> 6214.839999999999
all right I'm going to get my Illuminati

6211.8 --> 6214.84
kill on I'll be right

6229.679 --> 6232.679
back

6289.56 --> 6294.1990000000005
ah

6291.599 --> 6296.28
paraplegic lesbian woman of color to go

6294.199 --> 6299.159
to

6296.28 --> 6302.04
space they might have already done that

6299.159 --> 6302.04
I'm not sure I

6319.48 --> 6322.48
mean

6324.04 --> 6328.48
full inclusivity no but there's no such

6327.36 --> 6331.96
thing

6328.48 --> 6334.44
though it's never enough like it's never

6331.96 --> 6337.88
enough until the only people that are

6334.44 --> 6341.919999999999
left are exactly like that next step's

6337.88 --> 6341.92
just like okay now everybody must

6343.56 --> 6350.119000000001
like everybody must uh have every limb

6347.48 --> 6352.0
amputated like that's the only Next Step

6350.119 --> 6354.08
then it's like there's never enough

6352.0 --> 6357.04
there's no achievement there's only

6354.08 --> 6357.04
worse and worse and

6360.119 --> 6363.119
worse

6365.199 --> 6369.879999999999
yeah cuz

6367.28 --> 6373.0
inclusivity the only

6369.88 --> 6376.32
inclusivity is

6373.0 --> 6378.199
death yeah because there are so many

6376.32 --> 6380.48
there's more dead people in the world

6378.199 --> 6382.28
than there are living people yeah more

6380.48 --> 6386.4
more people have died than are currently

6382.28 --> 6389.48
living so to be inclusive everybody else

6386.4 --> 6389.48
must then die

6394.52 --> 6404.080000000001
too see there's no limit it's it there's

6398.719 --> 6404.08
only one end goal and that's everybody

6404.8 --> 6410.92
dies it's what it is what it's always

6407.48 --> 6412.4
has been it just took them a very very

6410.92 --> 6416.4
long time to get

6412.4 --> 6416.4
there and now they're rushing

6428.4 --> 6431.4
it

6478.27 --> 6486.029
[Music]

6486.32 --> 6491.719
terrible right and it's not terrible

6488.639 --> 6493.4400000000005
that they're there and they like it's

6491.719 --> 6496.8
terrible that

6493.44 --> 6499.239
they like being pushed to literally

6496.8 --> 6501.0
attack other people's

6499.239 --> 6504.04
rights

6501.0 --> 6507.28
right because rights for freaks is

6504.04 --> 6510.76
literally taking away rights of regular

6507.28 --> 6510.759999999999
people that's what it

6514.08 --> 6519.76
is that they're not giving them rights

6516.8 --> 6522.52
they're just taking it away that is the

6519.76 --> 6522.52
excuse for

6525.599 --> 6531.32
it it's really sick and evil though I

6530.0 --> 6534.159
mean

6531.32 --> 6536.92
if you could try to explain this to one

6534.159 --> 6539.32
of those people what they would know

6536.92 --> 6542.159
like that's what it is to have a

6539.32 --> 6542.159
contract with the

6543.84 --> 6550.0
devil yeah you're goated into like

6548.159 --> 6552.96
feeling like you're a winner and you're

6550.0 --> 6555.119
all standing up for yourself but the way

6552.96 --> 6557.159
you're doing it is literally attacking

6555.119 --> 6560.199
everybody

6557.159 --> 6562.638999999999
else and then either they accept that

6560.199 --> 6566.04
and they're like yeah I'm evil hog kill

6562.639 --> 6568.679
everybody I don't care I'm going to lie

6566.04 --> 6570.719
to achieve that or they're just not

6568.679 --> 6574.2390000000005
going to be able to handle it and like

6570.719 --> 6577.2390000000005
no no I can't be evil I'm not the bad

6574.239 --> 6580.839999999999
one you're the bad

6577.239 --> 6583.28
one while they just hide under it under

6580.84 --> 6585.1990000000005
the convenience of it under the

6583.28 --> 6589.199
attention of

6585.199 --> 6592.119
it as they contribute to destroying

6589.199 --> 6592.119
everything

6597.93 --> 6601.629
[Music]

6612.07 --> 6617.639
[Music]

6614.199 --> 6617.638999999999
I just stay away from those

6619.04 --> 6622.04
people

6630.97 --> 6634.109
[Music]

6646.159 --> 6649.04
[ __ ]

6646.92 --> 6652.04
[Music]

6649.04 --> 6652.04
sake

6668.76 --> 6673.4400000000005
kid who who cheat and the playing by

6674.36 --> 6677.36
themselves

6678.96 --> 6681.96
yeah

6692.199 --> 6698.32
but I mean literally like as soon as the

6695.119 --> 6699.719
apparatus that is just like weaponizing

6698.32 --> 6702.88
everything that

6699.719 --> 6704.56
is not wholesome and original and

6702.88 --> 6706.76
Christian you could say like that's a

6704.56 --> 6708.96
very basic way to now say it it's a

6706.76 --> 6711.599
little bit more complicated of course in

6708.96 --> 6714.2390000000005
reality but all those people are being

6711.599 --> 6716.119000000001
artificially stimulated like

6714.239 --> 6719.638999999999
overcompensated that's a good way to

6716.119 --> 6719.639
describe it they're being

6723.36 --> 6728.92
overcompensated and as soon as that

6726.44 --> 6731.719
stops because those people that are

6728.92 --> 6734.2390000000005
doing it are going to be stopped for

6731.719 --> 6734.2390000000005
criminal

6737.0 --> 6743.199
conspiracy then those people

6740.4 --> 6746.799999999999
those people will literally like kind of

6743.199 --> 6751.4
slip to the background and try to look

6746.8 --> 6754.639
more normal because now oh now Big Daddy

6751.4 --> 6758.239
money no longer protecting

6754.639 --> 6761.76
them yeah now they're just [ __ ] now

6758.239 --> 6761.759999999999
they've ended up on the wrong

6764.679 --> 6768.52
side that's where that will

6768.84 --> 6771.84
go

6774.599 --> 6779.360000000001
because they chose poorly yeah you

6777.84 --> 6783.52
chose

6779.36 --> 6783.5199999999995
evil derangement

6784.52 --> 6792.119000000001
selfishness and so at some point your

6788.159 --> 6795.199
protection for that runs out and then

6792.119 --> 6797.5599999999995
it's bye-bye time either you keep going

6795.199 --> 6800.4
until you get killed which was not going

6797.56 --> 6803.639
to take too long or you stop and you try

6800.4 --> 6808.04
to return back to normal but you will

6803.639 --> 6811.52
have no sympathy whatsoever from

6808.04 --> 6813.88
everybody you will be the [ __ ] Nazis

6811.52 --> 6815.079000000001
you will be regarded as the Nazis that

6813.88 --> 6820.1990000000005
were just

6815.079 --> 6820.199
defeated because in an indirect way you

6820.56 --> 6825.159000000001
are if you abused a lot of power I mean

6823.44 --> 6826.96
people will hold it to that it's not

6825.159 --> 6830.92
just like oh that person just happens to

6826.96 --> 6835.32
be trans or very gay and colorfully and

6830.92 --> 6838.1990000000005
flaming or whatever like if you

6835.32 --> 6843.04
never pushed anybody around politically

6838.199 --> 6845.239
or whatever then literally nobody will

6843.04 --> 6847.84
care it's just that nobody's going to

6845.239 --> 6849.32
protect you either anymore not really

6847.84 --> 6852.400000000001
unless you're just like a really good

6849.32 --> 6853.4
friend to people and don't push anything

6852.4 --> 6856.879999999999
on

6853.4 --> 6858.759999999999
them right so that's how it should be it

6856.88 --> 6862.4400000000005
should basically come down to character

6858.76 --> 6862.4400000000005
and if you've played along with this

6862.92 --> 6868.56
system abusing power that they just give

6866.36 --> 6869.48
you then you're going to pay the price

6868.56 --> 6872.52
for

6869.48 --> 6874.879999999999
it and I'm not threatening anybody like

6872.52 --> 6878.4400000000005
I don't even care about that because I

6874.88 --> 6881.84
stood clear from those people as it has

6878.44 --> 6885.5199999999995
been happening for 20 years I stood

6881.84 --> 6885.52
clear of them I was like I'm not

6886.199 --> 6891.96
even going to get in your way it's just

6888.88 --> 6895.599
like yeah there's no

6891.96 --> 6895.599
point like what's the

6896.719 --> 6902.88
point just let iron take him yeah you

6900.079 --> 6905.44
took the ticket it's quite literally a

6902.88 --> 6906.96
ticket of the devil I mean what you

6905.44 --> 6908.199
think you're going to see a literal

6906.96 --> 6911.199
devil and he's going to give you a

6908.199 --> 6914.32
literal ticket no no no it's the setup

6911.199 --> 6914.32
of the

6915.92 --> 6919.36
engagement and what you get out of it

6918.0 --> 6921.199
you get something out of it but there's

6919.36 --> 6924.5199999999995
always a

6921.199 --> 6926.44
price and they don't want you to know

6924.52 --> 6928.84
about that price and they want you to

6926.44 --> 6931.239
forget all about it and use as much as

6928.84 --> 6934.56
you can because it's in their interest

6931.239 --> 6935.5199999999995
because you are their soldiers you're

6934.56 --> 6938.8
their

6935.52 --> 6941.56
psychological societal cultural soldiers

6938.8 --> 6942.76
to attack their enemy which is the

6941.56 --> 6945.159000000001
nation the

6942.76 --> 6948.280000000001
people and they protect you with money

6945.159 --> 6951.638999999999
and then as soon as that ends yeah

6948.28 --> 6955.759999999999
you're now the ex naazi soldier of a

6951.639 --> 6958.04
defeated Nazi Germany

6955.76 --> 6962.4800000000005
yeah you're not going to have a good

6958.04 --> 6965.239
time and nobody will have sympathy for

6962.48 --> 6967.839999999999
you and a lot of you are going to end up

6965.239 --> 6972.239
killing yourself because you're just

6967.84 --> 6976.04
like completely you have nowhere left to

6972.239 --> 6976.04
go not even in your

6978.52 --> 6981.52
mind

6984.4 --> 6989.4
so I'm just like I'm just sitting it out

6986.8 --> 6992.639
it's like yep that's happening they're

6989.4 --> 6994.759999999999
doing that like okay well I I won't

6992.639 --> 6997.599
really have a life then too

6994.76 --> 7001.2390000000005
elaborately cuz I can't deal with that I

6997.599 --> 7003.04
I can't say yes to any of that I will

7001.239 --> 7006.44
never go along with any of that and I

7003.04 --> 7011.199
haven't I've never gone along with

7006.44 --> 7013.5599999999995
that like way back I was uncertain about

7011.199 --> 7018.119
what was even going on

7013.56 --> 7020.719
yet and I had confusions yeah but then

7018.119 --> 7025.04
as soon as I knew as as soon as I

7020.719 --> 7026.76
figured out some things about who I am

7025.04 --> 7029.679
what I

7026.76 --> 7033.599
am what my energy is what I'm supposed

7029.679 --> 7037.719
to be doing like I knew like yeah I can

7033.599 --> 7037.719
I just can't become part of this

7037.84 --> 7043.2390000000005
society which I read started feeling

7040.599 --> 7046.679
like when I was

7043.239 --> 7048.919999999999
15 was like yeah like no matter what I

7046.679 --> 7051.96
do it's like everybody just is like I

7048.92 --> 7054.84
can never do it right either like sort

7051.96 --> 7056.88
of like loose and hippie-ish and kind of

7054.84 --> 7059.2390000000005
gayish you could say like because of

7056.88 --> 7062.159000000001
just like just being loose not

7059.239 --> 7064.799999999999
homosexual and then people would nag me

7062.159 --> 7068.36
or it could try to be like absolutely

7064.8 --> 7071.4800000000005
the opposite and be more stoic and then

7068.36 --> 7074.32
people would me so people would [ __ ]

7071.48 --> 7076.678999999999
nag me no matter what I

7074.32 --> 7080.28
tried and I just didn't feel like I

7076.679 --> 7080.28
could find my place in this

7080.719 --> 7086.52
society and then later I saw how big it

7084.48 --> 7089.239
was that it's like an organized effort

7086.52 --> 7091.2390000000005
to undermine culture and undermine like

7089.239 --> 7095.159
white

7091.239 --> 7099.919999999999
males and I'm not even all that white

7095.159 --> 7101.839999999999
I'm not a a pure genetic white male

7099.92 --> 7105.599
and yeah that's just

7101.84 --> 7110.88
fine I don't mind nothing I can do about

7105.599 --> 7113.079
it anyway mostly white though but uh

7110.88 --> 7114.88
yeah there was just like I don't know

7113.079 --> 7118.5199999999995
what are you going to do with this

7114.88 --> 7122.1990000000005
nothing oppose it and learn a way to

7118.52 --> 7126.2390000000005
survive in complete opposition to

7122.199 --> 7128.96
that and be as careful as you can about

7126.239 --> 7130.638999999999
it but also keep being honest because

7128.96 --> 7133.76
you're hon honesty is like the weapon

7130.639 --> 7138.159000000001
that's the that's the hot

7133.76 --> 7141.320000000001
flame that keeps the Devils

7138.159 --> 7144.04
away it has to be real it has to be

7141.32 --> 7147.28
painfully

7144.04 --> 7150.32
truthful cuz that frightens the Devils

7147.28 --> 7152.599
the truth frightens the Devils they hide

7150.32 --> 7152.599
from

7153.4 --> 7158.32
it makes them turn away if they can't

7156.239 --> 7159.919999999999
stop it like if you do that to their

7158.32 --> 7162.5599999999995
face yeah they're attack

7159.92 --> 7165.119
probably but online they can't so they

7162.56 --> 7165.119000000001
just move

7168.44 --> 7172.36
away or they try to troll you but that

7170.96 --> 7174.92
doesn't really work that's a different

7172.36 --> 7178.759999999999
class of people

7174.92 --> 7181.88
even you're pretty white okay noran

7178.76 --> 7184.92
Dutch German yeah that does sound kind

7181.88 --> 7184.92
of white

7188.239 --> 7191.239
indeed

7193.8 --> 7199.0
right so for me it's just I could never

7196.119 --> 7201.04
really be a part of this world I just

7199.0 --> 7205.239
saw too much I knew what was going on I

7201.04 --> 7205.239
knew like people are literally being set

7207.36 --> 7210.759999999999
up to be

7218.159 --> 7223.96
destroyed

7220.44 --> 7227.4
and like I can't make it in this

7223.96 --> 7227.4
Society that's a

7227.719 --> 7234.04
fact I'm trying I'm trying all the time

7230.48 --> 7236.5199999999995
I got a YouTube channel well yeah I mean

7234.04 --> 7239.76
try to find anybody else that puts this

7236.52 --> 7241.119000000001
much effort into like doing this show

7239.76 --> 7244.400000000001
all the

7241.119 --> 7246.5199999999995
time that doesn't have

7244.4 --> 7248.4
like way more

7246.52 --> 7250.280000000001
subscribers even if they're like

7248.4 --> 7253.759999999999
complete trash and they look really

7250.28 --> 7255.4
freaking ugly and they're deranged like

7253.76 --> 7259.4400000000005
it doesn't

7255.4 --> 7261.5599999999995
matter so I I've been designated to not

7259.44 --> 7264.0
be able to make it in society to like no

7261.56 --> 7265.4800000000005
matter what I try I will end up in the

7264.0 --> 7269.239
loser

7265.48 --> 7273.5599999999995
hole and so I don't try

7269.239 --> 7276.5599999999995
then cuz really really it will happen

7273.56 --> 7279.18
like that I don't have a chance

7276.56 --> 7282.31
here I really don't

7279.18 --> 7282.31
[Music]

7283.04 --> 7287.119
so that's why I'm here that's why I'm

7285.199 --> 7290.48
doing this because this is the best

7287.119 --> 7293.0
chance I got because this is where it's

7290.48 --> 7293.0
up to

7294.48 --> 7298.4
individuals instead of a

7298.719 --> 7303.0
system that you're always going to be

7300.719 --> 7307.76
attached to it's up to the individuals

7303.0 --> 7307.76
whether I'm making it on an individual

7308.04 --> 7311.04
basis

7319.8 --> 7324.8
all right anyway cheers I'm going to eat

7337.96 --> 7340.96
this

7367.96 --> 7370.96
on

7385.88 --> 7388.96
in the summer you go

7389.76 --> 7394.4400000000005
Brown well if you have French in you

7392.04 --> 7394.44
that's not

7397.88 --> 7400.88
surprising

7413.78 --> 7421.83
[Music]

7427.88 --> 7430.88
for

7434.639 --> 7439.28
sometimes it takes longer to settle into

7436.559 --> 7442.159000000001
a place yeah it

7439.28 --> 7445.559
does for me it's taken

7442.159 --> 7445.558999999999
like 10

7445.639 --> 7449.639
years 20 years maybe

7457.8 --> 7460.8
even

7487.76 --> 7490.76
for

7514.48 --> 7521.48
what what are you talking about what

7517.84 --> 7524.559
vibration Shake Us in different

7521.48 --> 7525.959999999999
sees many people are so fat they never

7524.559 --> 7530.8
make

7525.96 --> 7530.8
it pass the top one

7537.52 --> 7543.320000000001
what I have no idea about that but I do

7540.92 --> 7546.4800000000005
know there's a lot of people out

7543.32 --> 7549.199
there and they simply choose not to be

7546.48 --> 7551.239
smart they choose to be a Slave because

7549.199 --> 7552.799999999999
if you're a slavish if you're white and

7551.239 --> 7556.919999999999
you're slavish it's

7552.8 --> 7556.92
like they will kind of leave you

7558.54 --> 7562.559
[Music]

7559.8 --> 7566.639
alone but if you present yourself as

7562.559 --> 7566.639
proud and all that like you're

7574.599 --> 7580.079
screwed and yeah that's how a lot of

7576.84 --> 7583.04
people cope out there

7580.079 --> 7584.4
they let other people bully them and

7583.04 --> 7587.559
they're always

7584.4 --> 7591.04
slavish and that's how they then

7587.559 --> 7591.04
survive in their

7592.52 --> 7596.320000000001
life I'm not doing

7596.52 --> 7602.320000000001
that like if I had to choose that I'd

7599.88 --> 7606.559
literally kill myself like that is what

7602.32 --> 7609.799999999999
would happen then cuz I'm way the

7606.559 --> 7610.88
sensitive to be able to tolerate that

7609.8 --> 7613.320000000001
kind of

7610.88 --> 7616.1990000000005
[ __ ] I've had that kind of bullying

7613.32 --> 7616.199
since I'm a little

7618.48 --> 7625.44
kid and I physically am incapable of

7622.48 --> 7625.44
handling that kind of

7629.159 --> 7636.0
crap so for me it's literally better to

7632.0 --> 7636.0
risk just violence

7636.96 --> 7642.36
then cuz I'll

7639.119 --> 7646.079
I have a better chance at surviving

7642.36 --> 7648.04
violence than cocking to bullying like I

7646.079 --> 7652.558999999999
just can't do

7648.04 --> 7652.559
it it's too

7653.2 --> 7656.41
[Music]

7667.52 --> 7673.1990000000005
dangerous yeah I get I get with seves

7671.0 --> 7676.04
how you separate the grains I I get that

7673.199 --> 7676.04
Woodwork and guty

7678.0 --> 7686.239
bear I just don't really see like fat

7681.239 --> 7686.239
people what I don't get the analogy

7697.44 --> 7700.44
exactly

7727.4 --> 7730.4
for

7783.79 --> 7786.89
[Music]

7787.32 --> 7790.32
for

7815.079 --> 7818.759999999999
you thought it was a good analogy no

7816.639 --> 7821.76
it's it's fine I just don't really

7818.76 --> 7821.76
understand

7826.36 --> 7831.0
specifically how it applies to what we

7828.44 --> 7831.0
were talking

7847.239 --> 7850.239
about

7864.119 --> 7868.28
right but anyway I was eating too and

7865.76 --> 7868.280000000001
all that

7877.159 --> 7880.159
so

7906.239 --> 7910.079
right but I mean yeah that's is what it

7908.76 --> 7914.360000000001
is

7910.079 --> 7918.4
and it's how I've lived it's kind of

7914.36 --> 7922.079
weird basically just trying to

7918.4 --> 7922.079
adapt but without

7923.559 --> 7928.84
integrating so for me it's like like how

7926.44 --> 7931.96
do you actually survive on minimum

7928.84 --> 7934.639
social welfare like that's the challenge

7931.96 --> 7937.079
that's been the challenge and didn't

7934.639 --> 7940.8
work out super

7937.079 --> 7940.799999999999
great at

7943.159 --> 7949.719
first but having this

7946.559 --> 7954.079000000001
show and having some support through it

7949.719 --> 7954.079
like it all together it does just

7965.88 --> 7973.52
work but I mean I'm still Outsider I'm

7970.04 --> 7977.84
still I'm not really trying to integrate

7973.52 --> 7977.84
with society and like oh try to get that

7993.36 --> 7999.96
job all right F being comfortable status

7996.44 --> 7999.96
go right okay that makes sense

8011.04 --> 8017.599
R yeah oblivious numpties you could

8015.199 --> 8021.199
yeah okay would working now it makes

8017.599 --> 8022.52
sense thanks for elucidating that that

8021.199 --> 8026.159
it does make

8022.52 --> 8026.159000000001
it yeah

8026.96 --> 8029.96
logical

8033.78 --> 8038.4
[Music]

8035.159 --> 8040.759999999999
oh look who's immediately straw maning

8038.4 --> 8043.119
me and getting

8040.76 --> 8047.8
banned

8043.119 --> 8052.96
yeah did I say government is

8047.8 --> 8056.88
evil why did I say that I

8052.96 --> 8059.88
didn't I don't think anybody here said

8056.88 --> 8059.88
that

8068.48 --> 8073.36
now you have to burn your drawing board

8070.52 --> 8073.360000000001
what what are you talking

8077.679 --> 8082.76
about you're doing great don't worry

8080.52 --> 8082.76
about

8083.66 --> 8089.88
[Music]

8086.88 --> 8089.88
it

8094.4 --> 8099.119
wait are modifications off again damn

8116.8 --> 8119.8
it

8126.559 --> 8135.52
yeah government so evil no nobody said

8132.04 --> 8138.84
that status quo have the program they're

8135.52 --> 8143.280000000001
running people that are in there

8138.84 --> 8143.28
governing in the government they're

8143.92 --> 8148.719
evil those people are literally

8146.559 --> 8152.4800000000005
conspiring against the people of the

8148.719 --> 8156.4
nation that they govern they are evil

8152.48 --> 8156.4
it's not the government those

8158.159 --> 8161.598999999999
people and their

8164.559 --> 8169.159000000001
policies which is currently the status

8176.719 --> 8179.719
quo

8198.519 --> 8203.800000000001
right but I mean I'm sure it's all super

8201.719 --> 8205.96
logical in your minds like oh well if

8203.8 --> 8207.479
the government is evil then why do you

8205.96 --> 8211.399
take their money well because you don't

8207.479 --> 8213.88
want to die of starvation or cold

8211.399 --> 8217.199999999999
because you don't have a house to live

8213.88 --> 8221.8
in yeah that's

8217.2 --> 8221.800000000001
why why do you think

8226.2 --> 8231.880000000001
idiot because it's my right as a Dutch

8230.16 --> 8234.679
citizen it's in the Constitution

8231.88 --> 8234.679
literally

8236.599 --> 8239.599
so

8241.359 --> 8247.319
where running government has very little

8244.679 --> 8247.319
to do with

8248.28 --> 8253.800000000001
that right so I don't know we could have

8250.84 --> 8255.960000000001
a conversation here I could just get

8253.8 --> 8258.399
angry and pissed off that it's so

8255.96 --> 8258.399
[ __ ]

8258.439 --> 8265.359
slow that I'm not really getting handed

8261.479 --> 8269.599
any actually interesting subject flat

8265.359 --> 8269.599
earth related or anything related or

8272.84 --> 8275.319
and that's

8275.439 --> 8282.16
it I mean it's nice having all these

8277.88 --> 8282.16
people in chat but I mean this is not

8296.519 --> 8299.519
good

8310.12 --> 8313.2
still good ads

8321.479 --> 8326.519
though right I don't know maybe I'm just

8324.439 --> 8329.519
not feeling all that

8326.519 --> 8329.519
great

8332.08 --> 8337.559
have a bit of a whiny tooth ache like

8335.519 --> 8339.76
feeling it's not nothing serious though

8337.559 --> 8343.24
it's

8339.76 --> 8344.800000000001
just annoying and I know it will go away

8343.24 --> 8348.199999999999
because it's not the first time I've had

8344.8 --> 8350.88
that I've that for decades so it's a

8348.2 --> 8350.880000000001
periodic

8351.439 --> 8356.359
thing oh yeah that's a good one Richard

8353.84 --> 8358.359
G yeah the video link yeah of course I

8356.359 --> 8361.2
checked it out I

8358.359 --> 8365.319
responded to your comment and

8361.2 --> 8365.319000000001
everything yeah that was really

8366.679 --> 8371.0
interesting like real

8384.16 --> 8391.68
microbiology

8386.439 --> 8391.68
oh found another video okay

8407.56 --> 8412.039999999999
cool outside of natural V

8416.359 --> 8419.359
sure

8421.6 --> 8427.319
all right Woodwork and gy be talk to you

8425.0 --> 8429.0
later thanks for being in the chat it

8427.319 --> 8432.399
was

8429.0 --> 8434.0
fun and your si analogy was good don't

8432.399 --> 8437.22
worry about

8434.0 --> 8442.879
it don't have to burn the drawing

8437.22 --> 8442.878999999999
[Music]

8446.319 --> 8449.319
board

8476.24 --> 8479.24
e

8498.72 --> 8502.24
right but yeah Richard G it is very

8500.6 --> 8505.24
interesting though that

8502.24 --> 8510.16
there's they're literally out there and

8505.24 --> 8512.16
they keep on rolling out this biology

8510.16 --> 8513.84
these biology videos I think they're

8512.16 --> 8516.64
even like getting a little bit more

8513.84 --> 8522.0
breathing room I think they all got like

8516.64 --> 8523.88
savagely assaulted around the whole Co

8522.0 --> 8527.439
pandemic

8523.88 --> 8529.199999999999
right but I mean they're they are active

8527.439 --> 8531.56
out there and they're making videos and

8529.2 --> 8536.16
they're getting to know each other

8531.56 --> 8539.96
and I'm bumping into other people

8536.16 --> 8543.24
too like mostly on bitu

8539.96 --> 8546.919999999998
though but it's fascinating to just

8543.24 --> 8546.92
learn like this detail

8551.24 --> 8557.72
stuff detail stuff about like what's

8554.359 --> 8561.319
actually going on in cells that's

8557.72 --> 8563.72
pretty like that it's just

8561.319 --> 8569.16
completely

8563.72 --> 8569.16
different the somd morphing is crazy

8573.8 --> 8580.84
maybe maybe Soma TDS are like cellular

8578.08 --> 8580.84
eels or

8583.479 --> 8589.16
something micro eels on a cellular

8592.76 --> 8599.08
level he says no fungicide kill it kills

8596.279 --> 8599.08
it

8620.88 --> 8624.88
yeah yeah it was pretty

8626.08 --> 8629.08
amazing

8634.74 --> 8637.979
[Music]

8659.24 --> 8666.68
no but that video is very interesting so

8661.399 --> 8669.92
yeah anybody that's still watching this

8666.68 --> 8672.399
after two and a half hours

8669.92 --> 8675.399
probably check out the comment section

8672.399 --> 8675.399
from yesterday's

8676.8 --> 8685.199999999999
video and yeah you have to then like

8681.16 --> 8687.279
actually click on newest comment CU

8685.2 --> 8688.640000000001
otherwise it won't show it that's just

8687.279 --> 8691.960000000001
weird like

8688.64 --> 8695.399
that right but my show yesterday CNN

8691.96 --> 8695.399
proves fossil fraud

8695.479 --> 8701.24
Etc so comments it says two comments it

8698.52 --> 8704.92
say newest first and then you get

8701.24 --> 8706.76
Richard G his comment in the B bitshoot

8704.92 --> 8709.439
link that's the one you want to check

8706.76 --> 8712.0
out very interesting video hey you could

an access to that link

8719.479 --> 8721.92
hey what's

8725.0 --> 8728.0
that

8732.359 --> 8737.319
oh all right

right yeah that's

8737.319 --> 8743.0
cool short

8740.279 --> 8746.880000000001
video it's all very

8743.0 --> 8750.8
fascinating and completely non Rel

8746.88 --> 8754.438999999998
relating to what they tell you it all is

8750.8 --> 8754.438999999998
out there in the

8754.92 --> 8761.439
mainstream it's such a different world

8757.479 --> 8763.88
it's just crazy that so much that's just

8761.439 --> 8766.319
being rolled out to everybody is just

8763.88 --> 8769.0
lies it's

8766.319 --> 8771.84
crazy anyway going to take a two-minute

8769.0 --> 8771.84
break I'll be right

8775.8 --> 8778.8
back

8896.24 --> 8901.72
it's like watching simatics yes it kind

8899.04 --> 8901.720000000001
of is isn't

8925.6 --> 8928.6
it

8931.319 --> 8934.519999999999

8955.52 --> 8958.52

amazing

9015.439 --> 9018.439
look

9045.439 --> 9048.439
for

9052.88 --> 9056.278999999999
yes duper I'm sure it

9061.72 --> 9067.519999999999
does right guys I I think I'm going to

9065.08 --> 9069.68
round out unless there's like a

9067.52 --> 9072.08
particular conversation that needs to

9069.68 --> 9075.359
roll out right now or something I don't

9072.08 --> 9077.08
know otherwise I'm going to round

9075.359 --> 9079.880000000001
out

9077.08 --> 9082.24
and hope that I'll be a little bit more

9079.88 --> 9085.319
inspired tomorrow I mean maybe I need to

9082.24 --> 9088.8
make notes again I don't know what it is

9085.319 --> 9088.8
it could just be the phase of the

9093.92 --> 9100.359
year like I have made some interesting

9097.56 --> 9100.359
shows right

9105.359 --> 9108.359
recently

9111.12 --> 9117.08
like the stuck between a

9113.92 --> 9120.8
wave assumption and IMM medium need was

9117.08 --> 9124.24
like a fantastic show super energetic

9120.8 --> 9127.24
flu fluid but now today

9124.24 --> 9130.399
it's and yesterday too it was

9127.24 --> 9133.16
like I don't know I'm just don't have

9130.399 --> 9136.92
the right energy I'm not sure what it

9133.16 --> 9139.359
is just no I don't get super inspired

9136.92 --> 9139.359
for some

9153.6 --> 9161.76
reason finally got home from work and

9156.64 --> 9161.76
it's ending yeah well my shows

9162.12 --> 9168.0
usually like well it's 2 hours 30

9166.0 --> 9170.56
minutes minutes I could go on a little

9168.0 --> 9172.72
longer if now you're here and you have

9170.56 --> 9177.08
stuff to share and all

9172.72 --> 9177.08
that sure I could go on a little

9177.88 --> 9182.0
more but it's just been going

9182.319 --> 9185.56
slow good

9186.56 --> 9195.08
show you think oh okay well as long as

9192.88 --> 9196.88
people that participate are enjoying

9195.08 --> 9200.88
themselves then it's

9196.88 --> 9204.358999999999
good maybe I just don't feel super great

9200.88 --> 9206.64
on the inside so I can't really feel it

9204.359 --> 9207.84
but I mean I am very happy that you guys

9206.64 --> 9210.76
like

9207.84 --> 9214.04
the come around in the chat like it's

9210.76 --> 9216.359
much better like this with like cool

9214.04 --> 9218.84
decent people coming in here and just

9216.359 --> 9221.0
having a bit of a chat then when it's

9218.84 --> 9223.960000000001
almost nobody or it's just a bunch of

9221.0 --> 9226.96
trolls

9223.96 --> 9229.24
so any idea on what light actually is oh

9226.96 --> 9229.24
my

9231.0 --> 9239.359
God I got ideas but I

9234.84 --> 9239.359
mean nothing super

9240.479 --> 9246.278999999999
conclusive but I think it's

9242.8 --> 9251.039999999999
instantaneous I think it technically

9246.279 --> 9251.04
doesn't have a minimum

9252.96 --> 9258.399
amount I don't think it is

9256.12 --> 9261.720000000001
electromagnetic because I don't think

9258.399 --> 9265.358999999999
electromagnetic actually is a thing

9261.72 --> 9265.358999999999
really that relates to light at

9266.72 --> 9271.8
all I think they just assume that it is

9282.8 --> 9287.84
that and there

9285.08 --> 9291.319
is energy in

9287.84 --> 9293.960000000001
there although yeah Define energy H

9291.319 --> 9295.0
that's problematic but I mean it is

9293.96 --> 9300.358999999999
there

9295.0 --> 9300.359
there's you can charge something with

9300.6 --> 9306.319
light you can have an influence on it

9303.52 --> 9309.319000000001
photoelectric plate to be of course is a

9306.319 --> 9311.96
classic example of that

9309.319 --> 9316.039999999999
but there's

9311.96 --> 9318.599999999999
more interactions that lies has provably

9316.04 --> 9318.6
in nature

9321.439 --> 9327.76
too but I mean yeah for me the what is

9324.84 --> 9331.2
light is just not a super

9327.76 --> 9331.2
straightforward answer

9335.319 --> 9340.76
anymore it's mostly just like let me

9338.439 --> 9343.0
summarize the the things that I know

9340.76 --> 9343.0
about

9344.16 --> 9349.96
it and

9347.279 --> 9352.439
really when also light is basically one

9349.96 --> 9355.8
of the most convoluted

9352.439 --> 9355.800000000001
subjects that has

9356.04 --> 9363.04
been

9358.359 --> 9365.399000000001
programmed like within its like design

9363.04 --> 9369.399000000001
like designed not by God but by people

9365.399 --> 9371.358999999999
describing it just programmed with

9369.399 --> 9373.92
misunderstandings it's almost like they

9371.359 --> 9373.92
did it on

9374.92 --> 9377.92
purpose

9379.76 --> 9383.439
to just have a lot of misunderstandings

9381.92 --> 9385.76
about light and what it is and what it

9383.439 --> 9385.76
actually

9386.76 --> 9395.6
does right and there's still Mysteries

9392.08 --> 9401.08
like like even in that

9395.6 --> 9401.08
video Richard G posted originally like

9401.68 --> 9406.359
show that literally showed like this

9404.279 --> 9409.560000000001
special microscope where you have to use

9406.359 --> 9413.04
like very very influenced

9409.56 --> 9414.278999999999
light to literally be able to see living

9413.04 --> 9417.84
cell

9414.279 --> 9421.04
activity it's a very unique type of

9417.84 --> 9423.68
microscopy fascinating very fasc because

9421.04 --> 9426.92
it's all demonstrated in that video so

9423.68 --> 9429.2
yeah check that out from two days ago in

9426.92 --> 9433.439
the comment

9429.2 --> 9436.279
section Richard G posted that and but

9433.439 --> 9438.6
what they all do with it with the I mean

9436.279 --> 9441.560000000001
there's so many things that you can do

9438.6 --> 9443.319
with this light and influence it and

9441.56 --> 9445.88
like

9443.319 --> 9448.68
just let it pass through a magnetic

9445.88 --> 9451.519999999999
field and then special filter this and

9448.68 --> 9454.800000000001
then then that and like holy [ __ ] man is

9451.52 --> 9456.960000000001
this light being like influenced the

9454.8 --> 9460.479
hell out of

9456.96 --> 9464.16
it but does any of it actually have

9460.479 --> 9466.84
anything to do with the wavelength of

9464.16 --> 9472.119999999999
it I really think think that the entire

9466.84 --> 9476.0
wavelength of light frequency

9472.12 --> 9479.240000000002
even that it's just they just don't know

9476.0 --> 9479.24
how else to describe

9480.479 --> 9486.679999999998
it and so they're just taking this

9483.68 --> 9489.08
conception just to be able to describe a

9486.68 --> 9491.279
complicated spectrum of

9489.08 --> 9493.8
influences that you can have on light

9491.279 --> 9498.479000000001
that will change its

9493.8 --> 9498.479
properties like a vast array of

9499.24 --> 9506.359
influences

9502.0 --> 9510.319
but they don't technically know what

9506.359 --> 9512.0
that influence really does well they

9510.319 --> 9513.92
know like oh there's something being

9512.0 --> 9516.279
done to the light but they don't know

9513.92 --> 9518.76
why that then the light does these

9516.279 --> 9521.08
things they have a model for it and it's

9518.76 --> 9524.279
all based on electromagnetic frequency

9521.08 --> 9529.0
blah blah blah

9524.279 --> 9529.0
but it isn't light doesn't have a

9529.92 --> 9537.08
speed there is no speed to vary

9533.319 --> 9537.08
manipulate in order to change the

9538.8 --> 9543.64
frequency so whatever is happening to it

9541.68 --> 9547.08
it has no relation to

9543.64 --> 9548.278999999999
speed which is what frequency is and so

9547.08 --> 9552.359
you're like

9548.279 --> 9555.800000000001
stuck in this Paradox of speed

9552.359 --> 9557.84
assumptions so like the entire design

9555.8 --> 9560.479
explanation designed within engineering

9557.84 --> 9560.479
of

9561.0 --> 9566.72
light like real roads people into

9564.399 --> 9570.039999999999
believing that it must be a wave and

9566.72 --> 9572.92
thus ether aberration nonsense is boring

9570.04 --> 9572.92
to accompany

9577.24 --> 9582.119999999999
that but it isn't though like there is

9580.24 --> 9583.279
no e there's no need for it there's no

9582.12 --> 9587.08
speed of

9583.279 --> 9589.12
light but yeah it it's just described as

9587.08 --> 9591.52
a frequency and the change of the

9589.12 --> 9593.92
frequency and it kind of works out

9591.52 --> 9597.04
mathematically and so that's just the

9593.92 --> 9599.88
way they describe it but technically

9597.04 --> 9599.880000000001
it's it's

9602.68 --> 9609.399
wrong and I I wonder if there have been

9605.8 --> 9612.399
people in history that did note this and

9609.399 --> 9613.92
then try to change the lingo about it

9612.399 --> 9616.278999999999
have there been attempts of people that

9613.92 --> 9618.359
were like I'm sick of people always say

9616.279 --> 9620.08
speed has a light and can't be a

9618.359 --> 9622.640000000001
frequency and so we're going to call it

9620.08 --> 9622.64
this other

9623.08 --> 9628.16
thing would be pretty interesting if

9625.52 --> 9631.68
other people would have been there in

9628.16 --> 9631.68
history trying to change

9634.92 --> 9643.52
it the knowing of which path is

9639.12 --> 9643.52
interesting is that quantum mechanics

9644.52 --> 9649.849
yes

9646.7 --> 9649.849
[Music]

9661.16 --> 9665.64
no duper light is not always

9667.359 --> 9673.0
there it manifests manifest through

9671.64 --> 9677.76
excitation of

9673.0 --> 9682.2
matter influences like yeah

9677.76 --> 9685.64
charge causes material to

9682.2 --> 9685.640000000001
basically emit

9692.12 --> 9697.800000000001
light right but without the matter the

9695.319 --> 9700.72
charge the electricity cannot cause

9697.8 --> 9701.759999999998
light so it's the specific combination

9700.72 --> 9704.96
of

9701.76 --> 9706.56
both charging of matter is what then

9704.96 --> 9710.56
causes the

9706.56 --> 9714.039999999999
light without the matter there will be

9710.56 --> 9717.039999999999
no influence that charge can have in

9714.04 --> 9721.439
order to create the light so without the

9717.04 --> 9724.880000000001
matter there is no light this is just

9721.439 --> 9724.880000000001
what it is like this is

9728.72 --> 9735.438999999998
fact we can't create light without

9732.319 --> 9738.16
matter being involved just electricity

9735.439 --> 9738.16
doesn't create

9744.43 --> 9747.559000000001
[Music]

9750.88 --> 9756.399
light yeah thanks gentle

9754.0 --> 9759.439
Bear yeah there's a lot of stuff I've

9756.399 --> 9759.439
been scooping up

9759.96 --> 9764.358999999999
recently I've had lot like the issues

9762.479 --> 9766.358999999999
with light have been there for quite a

9764.359 --> 9770.12
while

9766.359 --> 9774.720000000001
it's just such a big

9770.12 --> 9777.319000000001
thing there's so much research and stuff

9774.72 --> 9778.56
and re yeah research towards light has

9777.319 --> 9781.08
been

9778.56 --> 9783.64
done and so there's so many things you

9781.08 --> 9783.64
can do with

9785.439 --> 9792.800000000001
it one thing however you can do with it

9789.8 --> 9797.278999999999
is slow it down and then make it attain

9792.8 --> 9797.278999999999
a table speed

9798.08 --> 9803.84
it has no speed it's just yeah we're

9801.439 --> 9807.12
just assuming it's slowing down because

9803.84 --> 9807.12
we're lowering the

9811.12 --> 9818.0
frequency right and that's what it

9814.359 --> 9818.0
always is the speed is always

9824.279 --> 9827.279
assumed

9854.2 --> 9857.2
for

9880.68 --> 9884.16
yeah maybe I'll put that in the title

9882.2 --> 9886.359
electricity cannot create light without

9884.16 --> 9890.0
matter

9886.359 --> 9892.399000000001
fair enough factoid

9890.0 --> 9896.12
right everything is made out of matter

9892.399 --> 9899.358999999999
no not everything is made out of matter

9896.12 --> 9903.12
duper there's things that aren't matter

9899.359 --> 9903.12
light is one of them light is not

9914.08 --> 9917.08
matter

9941.0 --> 9945.92
isn't matter atoms well that's a

9944.08 --> 9948.6
model

9945.92 --> 9948.6
but

9960.8 --> 9967.119999999999
yeah how speed guns work not by

9965.319 --> 9971.119999999999
measuring the speed of light or the

9967.12 --> 9971.12
supposed alteration to the speed of

9974.0 --> 9977.0
light

9990.319 --> 9998.88
is made out of photons no photons are

9993.72 --> 9998.88
not made out of atoms duper for [ __ ]

10000.64 --> 10005.68
sake how do they

10004.0 --> 10009.92
work

10005.68 --> 10013.2
I don't give a [ __ ] how they work yeah

10009.92 --> 10016.04
why don't you go and like look in how

10013.2 --> 10018.560000000001
they work yeah I don't have one of those

10016.04 --> 10022.359
devices I don't have the manual why

10018.56 --> 10022.359
don't you go figure it out

10028.92 --> 10035.6
yeah I've got assumptions and ideas

10032.52 --> 10038.84
about it it's just

10035.6 --> 10041.6
I don't care I know oh so you're just

10038.84 --> 10044.52
here to be an ass okay okay well bye

10041.6 --> 10044.52
then [ __ ]

10046.319 --> 10050.278999999999
with yeah then you don't get to talk in

10049.399 --> 10053.479
my

10050.279 --> 10053.479000000001
chat okay

10053.69 --> 10058.319000000001
[Music]

10063.16 --> 10069.64
[ __ ] what are f photons then well

10067.08 --> 10072.2
photons are a Quant of

10069.64 --> 10075.72
light that's an

10072.2 --> 10078.800000000001
amount significant

10075.72 --> 10080.479
amount and how they were established is

10078.8 --> 10082.759999999998
by the interaction with the

10080.479 --> 10085.119999999999
photosensitive plate like the minimum

10082.76 --> 10088.439
amount of

10085.12 --> 10090.640000000001
light that is required to trigger a

10088.439 --> 10093.92
reaction in a photosensitive plate and

10090.64 --> 10097.16
that is how the photon the quanta of

10093.92 --> 10097.16
light was

10097.2 --> 10104.479000000001
established there is no unit of it there

10101.24 --> 10107.399
is no minimum size there's only minimum

10104.479 --> 10111.119999999999
amount in order to be able to register

10107.399 --> 10113.119999999999
it through interaction with material

10111.12 --> 10115.880000000001
that's what a photon is and it's all it

10113.12 --> 10119.04
is photon is not a

10115.88 --> 10119.039999999999
unit at

10122.0 --> 10127.24
all it's not like an atom not even

10131.319 --> 10135.72
close go [ __ ] yourself [ __ ]

[Music]

10153.72 --> 10156.72
with

10156.92 --> 10162.319
beliers use lasers a lot how fast do the

10160.68 --> 10165.399
lasers

10162.319 --> 10167.439
travel they're instantaneous they don't

10165.399 --> 10169.92
have a

10167.439 --> 10172.279
speed there is no measured speed of

10169.92 --> 10176.12
light there's only an assumed measured

10172.279 --> 10178.640000000001
speed of light assumed to have a speed

10176.12 --> 10178.640000000001
it isn't

10183.72 --> 10186.72
measured

10188.479 --> 10192.358999999999
yes duper that's exactly

10213.64 --> 10216.64
it

10234.35 --> 10238.7
[Music]

10243.64 --> 10246.64
e

10249.2 --> 10253.0
oh okay yes stepen J no I'm doing I'm

10251.88 --> 10254.92
doing

10253.0 --> 10258.239
okay I'm

10254.92 --> 10260.399
just a bit more irritable than usual and

10258.239 --> 10263.56
I don't want to get into this endless

10260.399 --> 10266.199999999999
wank sessions with these [ __ ] ass

10263.56 --> 10269.56
wipes they're always just oh but what

10266.2 --> 10271.52
about this stupid device yeah stupid

10269.56 --> 10275.0
device that doesn't measure the speed of

10271.52 --> 10277.76
light I'm done recycling your crap dude

10275.0 --> 10280.12
dudes shove those devices up your ass

10277.76 --> 10283.439
and get the [ __ ] out of

10280.12 --> 10287.2
here yeah there is no measured speed of

10283.439 --> 10290.800000000001
Lights of light and your stupid device

10287.2 --> 10290.800000000001
doesn't measure the speed of

10291.279 --> 10298.279
light there is none like there

10294.479 --> 10300.96
officially isn't any any yeah the only

10298.279 --> 10305.0
official measurement of any speed of

10300.96 --> 10309.16
light was between a presupposed distance

10305.0 --> 10311.399
of a Celestial light and Earth yeah

10309.16 --> 10315.479
that's the supposed data for the speed

10311.399 --> 10318.08
of light there is no measured speed of

10315.479 --> 10320.88
light and I will not discuss this with

10318.08 --> 10324.16
you there just isn't any and your

10320.88 --> 10328.399
[ __ ] devices don't do

10324.16 --> 10328.399
that so shove them up your

10333.479 --> 10336.479
ass

10336.52 --> 10341.12
they calculated that's right CU that's

10338.96 --> 10345.278999999999
what it always is it's between the

10341.12 --> 10347.439
freaking speed and wave

10345.279 --> 10349.68
assumption right they just have the

10347.439 --> 10351.960000000001
Assumption and then they calculate how

10349.68 --> 10355.16
much faster or slower it is the

10351.96 --> 10355.16
presupposition of a

10357.479 --> 10366.438999999998
speed yeah it's another

10361.12 --> 10366.439
[ __ ] I'm not dealing with you retards

10367.56 --> 10370.8
I'm not going to deal with

10371.439 --> 10378.319
you you're not even supposed to be here

10374.84 --> 10381.319
at all you hear me [ __ ] with you're not

10378.319 --> 10384.8
supposed to even be watching this if it

10381.319 --> 10388.278999999999
was up to me I'd make

10384.8 --> 10392.0
Google I I'd make them make it

10388.279 --> 10395.84
impossible for you as an individual to

10392.0 --> 10397.76
watch me you got it cuz this is not for

10395.84 --> 10401.12
you you [ __ ]

10397.76 --> 10404.92
retards get the hell away from me and my

10401.12 --> 10404.92
chat you got it

10420.6 --> 10428.76
[ __ ] do you pre no dupons I just

10424.439 --> 10428.76
explained about this a [ __ ] half

10434.479 --> 10441.319
hour I literally explained about this

10438.479 --> 10443.479
for like half an hour with long pauses

10441.319 --> 10446.278999999999
did you not pay any attention to

10443.479 --> 10446.278999999999
anything I've been

10453.279 --> 10456.279
saying

10461.29 --> 10464.429
[Music]

10475.72 --> 10480.358999999999
don't talk to them duper don't talk to

10478.84 --> 10486.279
the trolls why do you think I kicked

10480.359 --> 10486.279
them out not so you could talk to them

10488.88 --> 10493.8
you're not you're just riling things up

10491.88 --> 10495.92
you're just going to motivate them to

10493.8 --> 10500.56
come back with more sock accounts and

10495.92 --> 10500.56
whine more duper don't you get

10500.67 --> 10504.069
[Music]

10513.2 --> 10516.2
that

10521.64 --> 10525.519999999999
right I mean people just don't

10524.12 --> 10529.04
understand they think they have some

10525.52 --> 10530.92
stupid device it it measures a speed

10529.04 --> 10533.359
yeah it measures the speed that doesn't

10530.92 --> 10536.04
mean that it has a speed it just

10533.359 --> 10536.04
measures the

10536.2 --> 10539.960000000001
speed it's a piece of

10543.2 --> 10548.479000000001
technology

10545.76 --> 10549.64
I just I don't want to get into it it's

10548.479 --> 10552.84
so

10549.64 --> 10556.199999999999
tedious I don't like these tedious

10552.84 --> 10557.6
endless wank sessions these stupid

10556.2 --> 10560.880000000001
man-made

10557.6 --> 10563.52
devices this is like the same waste of

10560.88 --> 10566.08
time as if they like oh but but this

10563.52 --> 10571.12
gyroscope deviates because of ether

10566.08 --> 10571.12
rotation like it's a waste of

10571.64 --> 10577.278999999999
time like manmade devices don't prove

10576.319 --> 10581.199999999999
these

10577.279 --> 10585.359
things yeah building a device doesn't

10581.2 --> 10588.560000000001
prove speed has light or light has speed

10585.359 --> 10591.12
it doesn't you have to actually measure

10588.56 --> 10593.16
it yeah you don't do that with some

10591.12 --> 10595.319000000001
electronic

10593.16 --> 10597.84
device that you didn't point at

10595.319 --> 10601.199999999999
something just oh well that means that

10597.84 --> 10604.04
that measures the speed no it doesn't

10601.2 --> 10608.12
measure the speed of light it meas

10604.04 --> 10609.84
measures the speed of something

10608.12 --> 10612.800000000001
else

10609.84 --> 10615.399
yeah probably the only reason it even is

10612.8 --> 10618.438999999998
that accurate is because light is

10615.399 --> 10620.439
instantaneous and thereby with that

10618.439 --> 10624.399
consistent

10620.439 --> 10627.52
instantaneity becomes extremely

10624.399 --> 10631.599999999999
reliable to perfectly determine the

10627.52 --> 10631.6
speed of something else

10631.64 --> 10639.479
moving I'm just so

10635.52 --> 10641.68
tired of that [ __ ] being brought up over

10639.479 --> 10644.119999999999
and over again every time with this

10641.68 --> 10647.359
subject I'm not going to do it

10644.12 --> 10650.0
anymore not going to entertain these

10647.359 --> 10653.84
wankers with their

10650.0 --> 10656.96
[ __ ] radar detector [ __ ] whatever

10653.84 --> 10656.960000000001
you want to call it I don't

10659.43 --> 10662.69
[Music]

10663.0 --> 10666.0
care

10676.68 --> 10681.960000000001
what is making up the motivation for

10678.92 --> 10685.439
speed of light well because everything

10681.96 --> 10688.358999999999
in science and in the movies and space

10685.439 --> 10690.239
cosmology all assumes that light has a

10688.359 --> 10693.2
speed right that's why there's something

10690.239 --> 10694.56
like a light year it's ingrained in

10693.2 --> 10697.800000000001
their

10694.56 --> 10701.72
standard fundamental cosm cosmological

10697.8 --> 10705.84
thinking like in heliocentrism light

10701.72 --> 10709.56
must at all cost at all cost have his

10705.84 --> 10712.399
speed it must because if it doesn't the

10709.56 --> 10717.239
entire thing doesn't work in

10712.399 --> 10719.64
heliocentrism light must have a speed or

10717.239 --> 10719.64
nothing

10722.08 --> 10725.92
works that is never measured

10729.6 --> 10735.279
though that's only presupposed speed's

10733.64 --> 10738.16
presupposed right I'm going to

10735.279 --> 10740.239
presuppose that this Celestial body has

10738.16 --> 10742.64
a vast distance

10740.239 --> 10746.439
away and then I'm going

10742.64 --> 10749.319
to send some signal or whatever and then

10746.439 --> 10751.279
have a reflection or whatever and then

10749.319 --> 10755.84
well based on the Assumption of how

10751.279 --> 10755.84
distant it is I'm going to then

10755.92 --> 10761.12
presuppose that that means that the

10758.56 --> 10764.0
light traveled all that distance in all

10761.12 --> 10767.04
that time and thus calculate the speed

10764.0 --> 10767.96
of light because of this vast distance

10767.04 --> 10771.68
that you're

10767.96 --> 10775.199999999999
presupposing like it's all totally

10771.68 --> 10775.2
inconclusive it's all

10778.88 --> 10784.358999999999
nonsense why does light must have a

10781.72 --> 10785.76
speed in heal is I just explained that

10784.359 --> 10789.479000000001
they need

10785.76 --> 10791.479
it yeah for light speed they need it for

10789.479 --> 10794.438999999998
light years they need it for their

10791.479 --> 10796.72
stupid stories about oh you see that

10794.439 --> 10799.279
thing in the sky now that's from

10796.72 --> 10801.679999999998
billions of years ago at the beginning

10799.279 --> 10807.16
of of their

10801.68 --> 10810.960000000001
time it's all ingrained in entirety of

10807.16 --> 10815.76
heliocentric thinking that cosmology is

10810.96 --> 10815.759999999998
draping with light speed assump

10817.72 --> 10822.76
stories light speed assuming stories

10820.399 --> 10826.119999999999
it's full of it it's in

10822.76 --> 10828.880000000001
there they might not have needed to do

10826.12 --> 10831.6
that for any damn reason but they did

10828.88 --> 10834.96
and it's all hanging together of light

10831.6 --> 10837.16
speed assuming stories yeah that's what

10834.96 --> 10837.16
it

10842.72 --> 10845.72
is

10854.92 --> 10859.64
cops don't measure the speed of light

10857.399 --> 10859.64
that's

10872.64 --> 10876.92
correct

10874.8 --> 10881.08
think you flopped there a little bit

10876.92 --> 10881.08
with your lame trolling

10881.84 --> 10884.84
attempt

10898.439 --> 10901.439
yeah

10902.64 --> 10905.64
yeah

10922.479 --> 10928.039999999999
right so yeah getting a bit more Rowdy

10924.6 --> 10930.56
now but it is interesting

10928.04 --> 10932.04
though maybe I need to get a bit fired

10930.56 --> 10934.92
up to just get

10932.04 --> 10937.880000000001
going ow one was having a similar issue

10934.92 --> 10937.88
yesterday I

10937.92 --> 10941.2
feel was

10942.8 --> 10950.84
weird something excites the

10945.92 --> 10950.84
photons that is that's what makes

10956.08 --> 10964.88
light well yeah I mean right electricity

10961.68 --> 10970.84
in this case I'm going to assume

10964.88 --> 10973.92
electricity or combustion excites the

10970.84 --> 10978.92
matter by electrifying it or combusting

10973.92 --> 10981.92
it and then that basically

10978.92 --> 10981.92
releases

10982.52 --> 10988.08
light I wouldn't even call it photons I

10985.2 --> 10991.399000000001
mean light is not photons is merely like

10988.08 --> 10994.84
a quanta it's just an amount it's

10991.399 --> 10997.88
basically arbitrary it's not really

10994.84 --> 11000.439
super valid to

10997.88 --> 11003.92
like understanding the full nature of

11000.439 --> 11005.439
light because it's not a absolute unit

11003.92 --> 11008.12
it's merely a

11005.439 --> 11011.359
Quant it's the amount that is required

11008.12 --> 11014.640000000001
in order to trigger a reaction from a

11011.359 --> 11019.2
photoelectric plate that's what it

11014.64 --> 11022.479
is it's not a fundamental building block

11019.2 --> 11024.720000000001
yeah it's not like an electron in an

11022.479 --> 11025.72
atom

11024.72 --> 11028.599999999999
or

11025.72 --> 11032.039999999999
something or a proton proton or a

11028.6 --> 11035.76
neutron in an atom or even an atom it's

11032.04 --> 11038.160000000002
nothing like that arguably the nature of

11035.76 --> 11039.52
light is that it is potentially

11038.16 --> 11041.56
infinitely

11039.52 --> 11046.92
divisible meaning

11041.56 --> 11050.359
that there might simply not be a minimum

11046.92 --> 11052.399
amount there's only a provable minimum

11050.359 --> 11056.08
amount that is required in order to

11052.399 --> 11059.278999999999
trigger the photoelectric

11056.08 --> 11061.8
effect but that doesn't mean that pH

11059.279 --> 11064.84
that light could consist of less than a

11061.8 --> 11069.84
photon worth of energy and

11064.84 --> 11069.84
still do its thing spread

11069.88 --> 11075.56
around it just wouldn't be enough to

11072.76 --> 11079.0
trigger a reaction it doesn't mean there

11075.56 --> 11079.0
isn't any light you

11080.279 --> 11085.359
see you God duper

11093.279 --> 11100.279
obviously a unit means Unity that means

11097.359 --> 11104.52
one thing that means no longer being

11100.279 --> 11104.52
able to split it up and be the same

11105.16 --> 11111.119999999999
thing yeah a quanta literally means an

11112.279 --> 11115.279
amount

11153.73 --> 11156.85
[Music]

11163.319 --> 11166.239
all right I hope everybody's still

11165.2 --> 11168.640000000001
enjoying the

11166.239 --> 11171.199999999999
show if you're still here please don't

11168.64 --> 11172.199999999999
forget to rogans up the show that would

11171.2 --> 11173.76
be

11172.2 --> 11175.84
great

11173.76 --> 11178.16
and yeah you can always support me

11175.84 --> 11179.8
through the PayPal and the patreon would

11178.16 --> 11182.64
be kind of nice to have some more

11179.8 --> 11182.64
patreon

11186.96 --> 11192.96
supporters if you want to if you're into

11189.68 --> 11195.479000000001
that otherwise PayPal support is always

11192.96 --> 11199.96
good can always use

11195.479 --> 11205.199999999999
it my bills grown higher I mean it

11199.96 --> 11205.199999999999
is it's really a kind of a Nerf

11215.52 --> 11220.800000000001
in right but yeah I hope you're enjoying

11218.76 --> 11223.399

H got any more

11249.76 --> 11256.12
questions any more questions that don't

11252.52 --> 11256.12
involve stupid radar

11262.12 --> 11265.12

11338.279 --> 11343.560000000001
well rain is dropping over here now I'm

11341.96 --> 11346.399
really glad I did get out those

11343.56 --> 11350.08
groceries before the

11346.399 --> 11350.08
show I really

11351.359 --> 11357.720000000001
do flashlight need the battery to make

11354.239 --> 11357.72
light yeah

11358.56 --> 11365.399
the but it also

11362.239 --> 11368.239
needs the light the lamp itself is a

11365.399 --> 11371.319
piece of matter that is being

11368.239 --> 11375.399
electrified yeah without the piece of

11371.319 --> 11380.72
matter that is in the lamp there is no

11375.399 --> 11384.319
light cu the light of the flashlight is

11380.72 --> 11386.599999999999
literally a piece of metal

11384.319 --> 11388.199999999999
that is being electrified and that is

11386.6 --> 11391.960000000001
what is creating

11388.2 --> 11394.76
light so that's what if the Sun is like

11391.96 --> 11397.919999999998
a battery no it isn't duper it isn't at

11394.76 --> 11400.52
all yeah the Sun what we get to see like

11397.92 --> 11400.52
that's not an

11400.56 --> 11408.359
object so to say it's caused by this or

11405.68 --> 11411.2
that well guess what every example of

11408.359 --> 11414.08
what we know on how to make things as a

11411.2 --> 11417.52
man we make man-made things

11414.08 --> 11420.239
yeah that all involves electricity or

11417.52 --> 11423.479000000001
combustion with the interaction of

11420.239 --> 11425.52
matter that then creates the light so it

11423.479 --> 11427.88
doesn't apply to the

11425.52 --> 11431.399000000001
celestials

11427.88 --> 11433.519999999999
yes it doesn't apply to those things CU

11431.399 --> 11436.479
those things aren't

11433.52 --> 11438.76
objects and if they're not objects then

11436.479 --> 11440.399
how can they contain matter in order to

11438.76 --> 11443.6
create that

11440.399 --> 11447.08
reaction based on the material way that

11443.6 --> 11449.880000000001
we know how to create light yeah it's

11447.08 --> 11454.08
not related it's a different category

11449.88 --> 11454.08
it's a different class it's a different

11458.68 --> 11465.720000000001
world so the sun is not like a

11462.84 --> 11468.68
battery CU it isn't anywhere it's not an

11465.72 --> 11471.039999999999
object that's anywhere doing

11468.68 --> 11474.08
anything what we see as the sun is

11471.04 --> 11476.52
merely an apparition like a hologram an

11474.08 --> 11478.92
illusion that is at the epicenter of the

11476.52 --> 11484.560000000001
angular manifestation of the non-

11478.92 --> 11484.56
celestial the nonl local holographic

11490.64 --> 11495.64
celestials sun is the Hologram the

11493.12 --> 11498.6
projector would be the object

11495.64 --> 11498.599999999999
theoretically

11498.68 --> 11505.68
yes but yeah maybe the projector is

11502.04 --> 11509.880000000001
literally out outside of attainable 3D

11505.68 --> 11512.04
reality yeah this is my go-to argument

11509.88 --> 11514.358999999999
because hey if you're going to go into

11512.04 --> 11516.399000000001
the the place where you can no longer

11514.359 --> 11519.68
physically prove it then why the hell

11516.399 --> 11523.358999999999
not do this right that's my argument

11519.68 --> 11526.52
argumentation for that like yeah the the

11523.359 --> 11529.239
projector might be in the fourth

11526.52 --> 11531.319000000001
dimension so we literally can never get

11529.239 --> 11535.439
there we can only see the end result

11531.319 --> 11535.439
that is just Universal everywhere

11539.2 --> 11545.439
here the actual device that creates the

11542.359 --> 11546.640000000001
celestials might not be within the

11545.439 --> 11550.479000000001
Physical

11546.64 --> 11550.479
Realm as we perceive

11551.56 --> 11560.76
it it might be in a place through that

11557.239 --> 11562.88
we cannot reach or maybe you can reach

11560.76 --> 11565.479
it when you're like on some kind of

11562.88 --> 11567.08
super hallucinogenic drug or something

11565.479 --> 11569.519999999999
and then suddenly like oh I see all the

11567.08 --> 11572.16
dimensions and then it's like oh that

11569.52 --> 11574.6
oh well that's the

11572.16 --> 11577.119999999999
source and that Source will probably

11574.6 --> 11579.439
look like a big throne with somebody

11577.12 --> 11580.800000000001
sitting on it I guarantee you that

11579.439 --> 11583.76
that's probably what that's going to

11580.8 --> 11587.759999999998
look like right so it's all completely

11583.76 --> 11589.72
pointless to try to argue it out within

11587.76 --> 11592.64
the context of

11589.72 --> 11595.278999999999
physics cuz it's definitely not with

11592.64 --> 11598.278999999999
within physical

11595.279 --> 11598.279
reach

11598.6 --> 11606.0
right it's also very very tedious isn't

11602.239 --> 11608.319
it really physics and then looking at

11606.0 --> 11610.92
the celestials I mean no wonder that the

11608.319 --> 11613.96
celestials in the ancient times were

11610.92 --> 11616.16
like exclusively to the religious

11613.96 --> 11618.319
priesthood like that's their domain like

11616.16 --> 11620.319
the religious priests are like yeah you

11618.319 --> 11623.56
figure out those freaking stars and the

11620.319 --> 11625.439
Sun and the Moon because like we don't

11623.56 --> 11628.96
even want to try that [ __ ] anymore it's

11625.439 --> 11630.68
so tedious and like so weird and like

11628.96 --> 11632.399
staring everybody in the face and as

11630.68 --> 11635.399
soon as you start talking about them

11632.399 --> 11637.64
like people go crazy so we have to make

11635.399 --> 11640.439
up these weird stories just to like

11637.64 --> 11643.399
entertain them and calm them down and

11640.439 --> 11646.720000000001
distract them away from how incredibly

11643.399 --> 11651.239
bizarre and surreal the celestial lights

11646.72 --> 11654.8
are to just quickly make a story and

11651.239 --> 11657.8
that's really religious that's the

11654.8 --> 11661.0
mythologies just stories to entertain to

11657.8 --> 11664.199999999999
distract people from creeping

11661.0 --> 11666.2
out over realizations about something

11664.2 --> 11668.76
that's just staring them in the face all

11666.2 --> 11668.76
the time

11671.2 --> 11676.16
nonstop

11672.84 --> 11679.8
right and then later those delusional

11676.16 --> 11681.64
stories were perfected and as we call

11679.8 --> 11683.16
heliocentrism and that's what people

11681.64 --> 11686.239
believe now when they stare at the

11683.16 --> 11688.039999999999
celestial lights right if you tell them

11686.239 --> 11691.72
what I tell them yeah you get the same

11688.04 --> 11691.720000000001
effect as like what the

11692.72 --> 11700.278999999999
what but we thought that we worked it

11695.96 --> 11704.839999999998
out we worked it out we no it's no you

11700.279 --> 11704.84
don't it's just more [ __ ]

11707.439 --> 11715.479000000001
stories nobody went there

11711.399 --> 11717.358999999999
nobody move towards the moon or the Sun

11715.479 --> 11720.599999999999
and then as they were moving had the

11717.359 --> 11723.56
camera on it aimed at it at the

11720.6 --> 11726.960000000001
celestial body and then see the angular

11723.56 --> 11729.479
size gradually increase yeah nobody's

11726.96 --> 11731.399
ever done that in history and nobody

11729.479 --> 11733.8
ever will because it's physically

11731.399 --> 11736.439
impossible to do that because they're

11733.8 --> 11739.92
non-local Holograms that you cannot

11736.439 --> 11744.399
approach and they will always stay their

11739.92 --> 11744.399
apparent distance no matter what you do

11744.56 --> 11747.439
what about the new

11752.8 --> 11758.039999999999
Landing yeah I mean faking moon landings

11755.68 --> 11760.56
is it's

11758.04 --> 11763.239000000001
just it's just something that countries

11760.56 --> 11767.8
do now

11763.239 --> 11770.08
right I mean it's like the proof can you

11767.8 --> 11773.56
do you have the leadership in the hoods

11770.08 --> 11775.68
spy enough to lie to your people like

11773.56 --> 11778.64
they're completely [ __ ] and get away

11775.68 --> 11780.880000000001
with it well then you have to fake a

11778.64 --> 11784.64
moon landing right I mean you're not one

11780.88 --> 11787.92
of the club now in the world if you

11784.64 --> 11790.0
haven't faked the moon landing right I

11787.92 --> 11792.6
mean the big players how are they going

11790.0 --> 11794.92
to take you serious if you haven't even

11792.6 --> 11798.399000000001
faked a moon

11794.92 --> 11800.08
landing this sounds kind of weird but

11798.399 --> 11802.84
it's probably

11800.08 --> 11805.399
real like why else

11802.84 --> 11811.68
would they all be doing

11805.399 --> 11811.68
it why would the big guys be doing

11812.439 --> 11818.64
it yeah look at who's supposedly been

11816.239 --> 11821.68
going for moonlanding stuff like who's

11818.64 --> 11825.239
been doing that the biggest most

11821.68 --> 11825.239
prominent countries in the

11825.68 --> 11831.68
world and they want to be part of of

11828.84 --> 11834.319
being the big league well then you have

11831.68 --> 11836.399
to fake moon landing I mean it's that

11834.319 --> 11839.16
simple that that's the pattern that is

11836.399 --> 11841.519999999999
unfolding if you can't spot it by this

11839.16 --> 11842.84
time then like what the hell are you

11841.52 --> 11845.84
doing

11842.84 --> 11845.84
here

11846.08 --> 11852.08
like just go back to watching the news

11849.319 --> 11852.08
or something on

11854.359 --> 11859.479000000001
TV so there's not much to say about the

11857.199 --> 11861.880000000001
moon landing other than like Oh yay

11859.479 --> 11864.479
they're a special boy too they they too

11861.88 --> 11866.239
can lie to their people about a place

11864.479 --> 11868.438999999998
that doesn't exist and that nobody can

11866.239 --> 11868.439
go

11868.52 --> 11871.76
to that's

11872.88 --> 11878.399
it there was the guy who claimed the

11875.359 --> 11881.68
Moon is plasma what's my opinion on that

11878.399 --> 11886.72
well it's very simple he's

11881.68 --> 11891.359
wrong plasma is a state of matter matter

11886.72 --> 11892.64
means object means location means when

11891.359 --> 11895.359
you approach

11892.64 --> 11898.0
the object with the matter that it

11895.359 --> 11901.199
contains that makes it do what it

11898.0 --> 11904.239
does there will be an angular size

11901.199 --> 11905.08
increase within the observation of it as

11904.239 --> 11908.6
you

11905.08 --> 11911.08
approach there isn't any angular size

11908.6 --> 11912.92
increase within the observation as you

11911.08 --> 11914.84
approach it the

11912.92 --> 11917.76
moon not

11914.84 --> 11921.64
plasma because plasma is

11917.76 --> 11924.960000000001
matter so a hologram nonlocal hologram

11921.64 --> 11927.039999999999
can't be plasma a nonlocal hologram is a

11924.96 --> 11929.239
nonlocal hologram it's an apparition

11927.04 --> 11930.960000000001
it's a a light

11929.239 --> 11933.64
play

11930.96 --> 11936.438999999998
situation that is happening and there's

11933.64 --> 11940.56
no matter involved it's just

11936.439 --> 11944.84
light if it's plasma it's not a l local

11940.56 --> 11947.359
hologram so very simple the Moon is not

11944.84 --> 11948.64
plasma neither is the sun neither are

11947.359 --> 11950.68
any of the

11948.64 --> 11954.0
celestials they're

11950.68 --> 11955.199
nonmaterial this Apparition we see is

11954.0 --> 11957.72
not

11955.199 --> 11961.16
Material there might be material

11957.72 --> 11963.239
somewhere involved somehow but not in

11961.16 --> 11968.119999999999
relation to what we're actually looking

11963.239 --> 11968.119999999999
at that is not Material you're looking

11981.04 --> 11984.04
at

11991.64 --> 11995.84
all the

11992.84 --> 11998.84
crafts diverging

11995.84 --> 11998.84
Rays

12009.84 --> 12017.08
yeah actually it's quite a possible for

12013.479 --> 12017.08
a hologram not to have

12023.92 --> 12028.88
that right because it's non local so

12026.72 --> 12032.0
it's always everything about is angular

12028.88 --> 12035.16
you can't have non- Divergent

12032.0 --> 12038.279
Rays cuz if you have a Apparent Source

12035.16 --> 12042.0
Point then how could it

12038.279 --> 12045.0
not diverge it wouldn't be able to

12042.0 --> 12048.0
because it's apparent everything

12045.0 --> 12048.0
diverges from

12058.319 --> 12062.76
it why does the Sun have diverging rays

12061.199 --> 12065.76
and not the

12062.76 --> 12065.76
moon

12068.72 --> 12073.84
uh doesn't

12070.84 --> 12073.84
it

12077.399 --> 12081.399
I don't know I'm not sure it's

12082.439 --> 12088.479000000001
just maybe it does but I mean the

12085.96 --> 12093.399
apparent sunlight from the Sun and all

12088.479 --> 12097.72
that during the day is a lot more

12093.399 --> 12099.64
intense it has more strength to it so

12097.72 --> 12102.64
it's going to be able to

12099.64 --> 12105.8
influence the material goes through more

12102.64 --> 12109.0
and just be more reflective be more

12105.8 --> 12112.119999999999
distinct so I'm not sure if Moonlight

12109.0 --> 12114.76
can't have like diverging Rays at

12112.12 --> 12116.92
all I'm not sure if Moonlight is

12114.76 --> 12119.880000000001
completely incapable of having

12116.92 --> 12122.64
crepuscular Rays I actually think it

12119.88 --> 12124.92
can but it has to be special

12122.64 --> 12127.08
circumstances where it has to be really

12124.92 --> 12130.76
crystal clear night and some clouds that

12127.08 --> 12134.08
just have to be perfectly

12130.76 --> 12138.68
placed so I think corpuscular Rays from

12134.08 --> 12138.68
moon is very rare compared to

12139.53 --> 12144.04
[Music]

12141.04 --> 12148.12
Sun I think I have seen corpuscular Rays

12144.04 --> 12150.720000000001
from the Moon a whole long time ago then

12148.12 --> 12151.76
again I can't be sure no no it can't be

12150.72 --> 12156.399
dark

12151.76 --> 12156.399
world there's no celestials in the Dark

12160.76 --> 12163.76
World

12166.92 --> 12169.479
any more

12189.56 --> 12194.399
questions maybe you see them too you

12191.84 --> 12197.0
don't remember yeah well now you can

12194.399 --> 12200.0
actually look out for it and and pay

12197.0 --> 12204.72
more attention as to what you could be

12200.0 --> 12207.88
seeing right because it's all so magical

12204.72 --> 12209.76
now the celestial lights are incredibly

12207.88 --> 12212.198999999999
magical and

12209.76 --> 12214.6
mysterious I mean it's the only

12212.199 --> 12216.6
non-local Holograms you're ever going to

12214.6 --> 12220.640000000001
deal with and everybody that you've ever

12216.6 --> 12222.92
met has seen them and all your ancestors

12220.64 --> 12226.319
have seen them and none of them have

12222.92 --> 12227.359
ever really truly known what the hell

12226.319 --> 12231.479
they

12227.359 --> 12233.640000000001
are and how that's possible everybody's

12231.479 --> 12237.599999999999
lived through it

12233.64 --> 12239.278999999999
everyone and there's a lot of like very

12237.6 --> 12241.68
mysterious

12239.279 --> 12244.08
sightings with celestials I've heard

12241.68 --> 12247.64
stories that just blow my mind every

12244.08 --> 12252.08
time I hear them about people that would

12247.64 --> 12255.039999999999
like go fish like very like north of

12252.08 --> 12257.72
Norway very North and then at a certain

12255.04 --> 12259.84
latitude by their own words they would

12257.72 --> 12263.08
often during the

12259.84 --> 12266.880000000001
day like during the summer season in the

12263.08 --> 12270.039999999999
day they would start to see the sun in a

12266.88 --> 12272.599999999999
very peuli way where it would appear

12270.04 --> 12274.68
like it's super close it would feel like

12272.6 --> 12277.319
it's like 100 m

12274.68 --> 12280.800000000001
away it would be very close and

12277.319 --> 12284.92
extremely bright and just give this very

12280.8 --> 12289.16
odd sensation like the literally like

12284.92 --> 12291.239
came down from Far appearing to be far

12289.16 --> 12293.92
away to

12291.239 --> 12295.319
like very close like it's just sitting

12293.92 --> 12297.319
there right in front of you it still

12295.319 --> 12300.119999999999
moves with you but it's just like

12297.319 --> 12303.278999999999
appearing to be like absurdly close

12300.12 --> 12306.6
almost like ah it's going to burn me

12303.279 --> 12309.800000000001
like very odd sightings about it that

12306.6 --> 12313.479000000001
would typically happen that happened in

12309.8 --> 12313.479
Spain what

12314.88 --> 12322.399
okay maybe that's weird I heard it was

12319.439 --> 12326.08
like near the Arctic

12322.399 --> 12331.16
Circle in yeah in the North during the

12326.08 --> 12332.84
first world war what okay that is I

12331.16 --> 12337.08
don't know about that never heard of

12332.84 --> 12337.08
that one that is very

12340.479 --> 12343.479
odd

12350.92 --> 12354.239
H very

12356.359 --> 12360.12
strange right but my point is is that

12358.88 --> 12363.438999999998
there's all

12360.12 --> 12366.479000000001
these movie about let

12363.439 --> 12368.76
okay what a movie about are you sure an

12366.479 --> 12372.438999999998
actual Hollywood movie

12368.76 --> 12373.84
or a small documentary

12372.439 --> 12376.16
cuz I thought there was a small

12373.84 --> 12379.8
documentary on how the Sun just appeared

12376.16 --> 12383.479
to be absurdly close but that was on a

12379.8 --> 12383.479
fisher boat in the

12386.8 --> 12393.8
north they described how the Sun would

12389.52 --> 12393.800000000001
just appear to like sit on the

12394.76 --> 12398.16
ice very

12400.399 --> 12404.519999999999
close

12402.279 --> 12406.399000000001
and like it would sneak up on them too

12404.52 --> 12408.279
it's not like oh it's all there and

12406.399 --> 12410.198999999999
suddenly it's going down to that place

12408.279 --> 12413.16
no it's like suddenly they would just

12410.199 --> 12414.6
like cuz they would get disoriented or

12413.16 --> 12416.8
whatever you're not always looking at

12414.6 --> 12419.239
the sun and then you're just turning

12416.8 --> 12421.479
around as like wait what how did it get

12419.239 --> 12423.76
so close there like it suddenly came

12421.479 --> 12426.72
down and sneaked up and you're like hi

12423.76 --> 12429.960000000001
I'm here I'm very bright I'm very close

12426.72 --> 12429.96
I don't make any damn

12430.319 --> 12436.8
sense

12432.8 --> 12436.8
but yeah celestials very

12438.84 --> 12445.08
mysterious and the more you know how

12441.52 --> 12447.439
mysterious they are the more you might

12445.08 --> 12449.92
pay attention as to what is what is it

12447.439 --> 12454.279
you're actually looking

12449.92 --> 12460.08
at don't just take it for granted as

12454.279 --> 12460.08
much f with Harley ke

12460.319 --> 12463.319
okay

12465.76 --> 12473.0
you had that with the moon where it felt

12469.12 --> 12476.0
it wanted me to see it

12473.0 --> 12476.0
yeah

12482.84 --> 12490.239
yeah I started it

12485.84 --> 12493.16
clouds covered in gun

12490.239 --> 12495.039999999999
yeah

12493.16 --> 12497.96
moon is

12495.04 --> 12500.319000000001
weird sun is weird too but the Moon is

12497.96 --> 12502.278999999999
like arguably even more weird like why

12500.319 --> 12507.359
the hell does it look like

12502.279 --> 12512.04
a sort of a physical object like that

12507.359 --> 12512.04
why like who the hell came up with that

12512.199 --> 12516.239000000001
[ __ ] I mean it kind of always looked

12515.04 --> 12518.960000000001
like

12516.239 --> 12521.84
that it must at some point have just

12518.96 --> 12524.919999999998
kind of like more like the sun so how

12521.84 --> 12528.04
did it then change into this weird

12524.92 --> 12531.08
crater is looking Shadow play that it is

12528.04 --> 12533.880000000001
now it's so strange the Moon is so

12531.08 --> 12533.88
unbelievably

12535.92 --> 12540.72
strange like it is the weirdest of all

12539.319 --> 12543.76
the celestial

12540.72 --> 12546.56
lights closely followed by Saturn which

12543.76 --> 12546.56
is really

12550.12 --> 12553.12
weird

12558.08 --> 12562.72
looked at the Moon looked extremely

12559.8 --> 12565.119999999999
yellow yeah I mean that can happen Moon

12562.72 --> 12568.88
can be like yellowish

12565.12 --> 12571.319000000001
and I've seen it a pink moon it's like

12568.88 --> 12574.399
literally pink

12571.319 --> 12578.88
colored and then there's like the red

12574.399 --> 12580.319
moon of supposed eclipses and but I mean

12578.88 --> 12582.759999999998
yeah the moon can take all kinds of

12580.319 --> 12585.16
colors just like the sun can take on all

12582.76 --> 12585.16
kinds of

12587.12 --> 12593.359
colors or rather the light that it casts

12590.6 --> 12596.399000000001
just get gets all these weird

12593.359 --> 12600.12
colors right that is also weird by the

12596.399 --> 12600.119999999999
way when you really think about

12604.12 --> 12610.84
it like how is the sun like really

12608.72 --> 12613.92
getting close to the Horizon and it's

12610.84 --> 12616.84
like oh the you still have light hitting

12613.92 --> 12618.479
the clouds above you which is already

12616.84 --> 12620.880000000001
like surreal and

12618.479 --> 12625.16
freaky that's really

12620.88 --> 12628.16
weird but then like it's another

12625.16 --> 12628.16
color

12628.96 --> 12634.519999999999
what like how is there like orange and

12632.479 --> 12639.358999999999
pink

12634.52 --> 12641.76
light then like that hitting the clouds

12639.359 --> 12644.76
like I always find find that very

12641.76 --> 12646.880000000001
strange and I know the theories about

12644.76 --> 12648.199
like oh it's all the atmosphere in

12646.88 --> 12652.039999999999
between

12648.199 --> 12655.479000000001
and oh just changes the color but still

12652.04 --> 12658.359
man still it's weird it's weird like

12655.479 --> 12661.239
bright colored and it just seems like

12658.359 --> 12662.56
how the hell is it becoming that color

12661.239 --> 12665.239
there's

12662.56 --> 12668.56
like I don't believe it's just a bunch

12665.239 --> 12669.96
of compacted sky in between that's like

12668.56 --> 12671.8
doing

12669.96 --> 12675.16
that

12671.8 --> 12677.88
like if that were doing that they would

12675.16 --> 12680.6
be doing it more and not just when the

12677.88 --> 12683.56
sun like touches the

12680.6 --> 12685.800000000001
Horizon it's just weird man and like

12683.56 --> 12688.198999999999
Beyond when you can't even see the sun

12685.8 --> 12690.119999999999
anymore and then it you see some clouds

12688.199 --> 12693.68
above you lit up that's when it's going

12690.12 --> 12696.68
to have colors and stuff like

12693.68 --> 12696.68
ah

12699.96 --> 12702.96
strange

12713.96 --> 12718.96
right man my God I can't believe it's

12716.239 --> 12720.52
almost 6 o'clock here right I am going

12718.96 --> 12722.198999999999
to round out the show I've been going

12720.52 --> 12724.960000000001
over three and a half

12722.199 --> 12727.16
hours thanks everyone for coming I hope

12724.96 --> 12730.438999999998
you like this show it ended kind of

12727.16 --> 12732.92
nicely with like just this open question

12730.439 --> 12735.479000000001
about what what is

12732.92 --> 12737.64
it what are they actually I mean I

12735.479 --> 12738.399
describe them non-local Holograms and

12737.64 --> 12742.319
all

12738.399 --> 12746.319
that but that's just merely my puny

12742.319 --> 12749.278999999999
human attempt to try to describe the

12746.319 --> 12752.92
mystery that is just so insurmountable

12749.279 --> 12755.800000000001
basically so insurmountable that the

12752.92 --> 12758.319
entirety of humanity has like not really

12755.8 --> 12762.0
been able to figure it out over

12758.319 --> 12764.84
allegedly thousands of years

12762.0 --> 12767.239
so much that literally religions have

12764.84 --> 12770.960000000001
sprung forth based on

12767.239 --> 12773.479
storytelling Traditions just to try to

12770.96 --> 12777.278999999999
explain to people what they are so they

12773.479 --> 12779.72
stop asking about it I mean that's how

12777.279 --> 12782.16
freaking mysterious the celestial lights

12779.72 --> 12782.16
are

12784.399 --> 12788.84
okay one thing is for sure they are

12787.16 --> 12791.119999999999
designed they're part of the design

12788.84 --> 12793.239
they're part of the system of the whole

12791.12 --> 12795.0
thing it's part of the holistic system

12793.239 --> 12799.56
of

12795.0 --> 12803.12
Earth and we may never truly figure out

12799.56 --> 12806.16
what it is or how it is why it might

12803.12 --> 12810.12
simply be that one insolvable mystery

12806.16 --> 12812.96
that is just there to inspire us and

12810.12 --> 12815.68
make us chase it and then give up again

12812.96 --> 12815.679999999998
you never really

12817.52 --> 12822.399000000001
know right nobody ever really knows like

12820.52 --> 12824.04
you're great great great grandfather

12822.399 --> 12827.119999999999
also didn't

12824.04 --> 12829.720000000001
know and your grandchild if you're lucky

12827.12 --> 12831.6
enough to have one they Pro probably

12829.72 --> 12835.84
won't know although they'll have a lot

12831.6 --> 12837.52
of stories to fill in explaining why

12835.84 --> 12840.439
that are complete

12837.52 --> 12842.0
nonsense they'll have lots of that we

12840.439 --> 12844.08
already have lots of those types of

12842.0 --> 12847.12
stories yeah it's the complete nonsense

12844.08 --> 12848.96
and that world just explain what it is

12847.12 --> 12851.640000000001
without any actual

12848.96 --> 12854.56
proof there seems to be

12851.64 --> 12855.84
upward Trend in making up nonsense just

12854.56 --> 12859.76
to

12855.84 --> 12862.319
Fain that you know things in this world

12859.76 --> 12865.08
and and dumb people that just settle

12862.319 --> 12869.039999999999
with that it's like oh I like the way

12865.08 --> 12872.16
you're madeup nonsense sounds I like you

12869.04 --> 12875.359
you sound smart yeah you didn't prove

12872.16 --> 12879.439
anything but I like the way you

12875.359 --> 12879.439
tried I'm going to go with

12879.68 --> 12885.68
you please don't be those people with me

12883.319 --> 12889.439
I mean I really try to make myself

12885.68 --> 12891.52
understood and I know it's not easy at

12889.439 --> 12894.199
times right

12891.52 --> 12896.12
anyhow again thanks everyone for coming

12894.199 --> 12898.319000000001

12917.52 --> 12925.960000000001
than always seems to be

12921.319 --> 12928.96
a never in expanding

12925.96 --> 12931.08
problem the expands with the inflation

12928.96 --> 12932.56
or whatever is exactly causing this

12931.08 --> 12935.199
massive

12932.56 --> 12937.359
Financial collapse that's happening here

12935.199 --> 12939.960000000001
in

12937.359 --> 12942.279
Europe why would that be could it be

12939.96 --> 12945.198999999999
because like everything is being thrown

12942.279 --> 12948.92
away at an insane War that's literally

12945.199 --> 12951.319000000001
impossible to win even if all the money

12948.92 --> 12953.52
in the world literally would be given to

12951.319 --> 12955.479
them then they still would not like you

12953.52 --> 12959.479000000001
could literally give all of Russia's

12955.479 --> 12962.599999999999
money to Ukraine and they still wouldn't

12959.479 --> 12963.72
be able to win the [ __ ] War okay it's

12962.6 --> 12967.0
that

12963.72 --> 12970.239
[ __ ] but these [ __ ]

12967.0 --> 12972.92
elitists these Marxist scumback Traders

12970.239 --> 12974.56
here have taken everything under their

12972.92 --> 12977.239
wing and under their control and they're

12974.56 --> 12979.198999999999
in there and in everything they are

12977.239 --> 12982.16
doing it anyway and they're just giving

12979.199 --> 12983.52
away everything we got to them to

12982.16 --> 12986.84
destroy

12983.52 --> 12990.439
it to literally burn it

12986.84 --> 12992.880000000001
up they're they're making they're

12990.439 --> 12997.0
ensuring that Ukraine is not going to

12992.88 --> 13000.479
get cold by giving them our printed

12997.0 --> 13002.84
money to burn in their fireplaces pretty

13000.479 --> 13004.96
Prett much I mean that's actually like

13002.84 --> 13008.439
one of the best comparison like the best

13004.96 --> 13010.198999999999
metaphors I've ever heard it is the best
