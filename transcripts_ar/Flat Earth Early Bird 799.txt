99.68 --> 108.0
right so the weather today

103.92 --> 110.399
is quite different

108.0 --> 110.399
boom

111.04 --> 119.43900000000001
yeah check that out

115.68 --> 123.43900000000001
it's it's snowing

119.439 --> 126.79899999999999
and not a little it's snowing a lot

123.439 --> 130.07999999999998
it's been snowing all night

126.799 --> 134.959
started yesterday evening

130.08 --> 134.959
after dark and just like look at that

135.28 --> 139.76
there's a lot of snow going around and

137.68 --> 143.20000000000002
there's a lot of wind and

139.76 --> 147.12
yeah everything is getting frozen

143.2 --> 148.0
so even see it's like this block of ice

147.12 --> 152.8
i chipped away

148.0 --> 152.8
piece it's just ice

153.44 --> 159.04
i thought it was snow first but it was

155.36 --> 159.04000000000002
just ice stuck to it

159.44 --> 162.16
so yeah

162.8 --> 169.84
it turned into total winter overnight

167.44 --> 172.319
and there is like thick layers of snow

169.84 --> 172.31900000000002
out there

173.92 --> 177.599
i don't see any more bikes because i

175.84 --> 178.72
think it's probably just too dangerous

177.599 --> 180.959
to go around on

178.72 --> 184.159
on a bike now i still have to go for

180.959 --> 185.92000000000002
groceries later

184.159 --> 189.35999999999999
i think i'm just going to take a walk

185.92 --> 189.35999999999999
take it take my time a little

192.48 --> 199.2
but yeah pretty astounding to just see

194.56 --> 202.4
switch around a and on my birthday

199.2 --> 202.39999999999998
how typical is that

207.2 --> 211.11999999999998
now how many times have i said now like

209.28 --> 212.72
if it's gonna snow in the netherlands

211.12 --> 213.92000000000002
it's probably going to happen on my

212.72 --> 216.159
birthday it

213.92 --> 217.44
i see there seems to be something about

216.159 --> 227.84
that

217.44 --> 227.84
and it happened again

232.72 --> 239.2
hello brandon good to see you

236.319 --> 239.2
they're the first

239.519 --> 243.439
random explorer ah

245.439 --> 250.0
so yeah it's snowing outside pretty

247.519 --> 250.0
heavily

251.599 --> 258.479
and it's interesting

255.84 --> 259.68
also just like there is more light

258.479 --> 265.36
because of it as well

259.68 --> 265.36
just all that white it's funny how that

266.84 --> 269.84
works

270.639 --> 277.44
so how's the weather over there

274.4 --> 283.84
and how are you doing today's show is

277.44 --> 283.84
just going to be an hour

285.52 --> 288.32
good to see you

290.08 --> 297.84
minus 36.

293.759 --> 297.84000000000003
wow that's that is cool

300.32 --> 303.68
right over here it seems to be minus

302.96 --> 305.96999999999997
three

303.68 --> 308.16
celsius

305.97 --> 311.84000000000003
[Music]

308.16 --> 311.84000000000003
i just checked it

315.12 --> 325.84000000000003
man george minus 36 that's

318.56 --> 325.84
that's another level

329.199 --> 334.96000000000004
this is some crazy sights too and it's a

332.08 --> 338.0
constant basis just

334.96 --> 341.039
like off the roof there's just these

338.0 --> 341.039
small little

342.8 --> 349.759
tornadoes of snow happening

345.919 --> 352.24
especially when a big gust of wind hits

349.759 --> 355.44
and it's crazy sight to see that let's

352.24 --> 355.44
see if it's going to happen again

363.199 --> 368.72
yeah there it is look at that

372.96 --> 381.84
see it's just what

388.56 --> 395.84
but yeah it looks it looks and it is

392.0 --> 395.84
really cold

396.24 --> 399.759
oh yeah and there was this really weird

398.08 --> 403.35999999999996
situation too yesterday

399.759 --> 405.12
really weird it was kind of creepy but

403.36 --> 407.44
i it was in the middle of the night like

405.12 --> 408.0
two o'clock and then suddenly i heard

407.44 --> 411.84
like

408.0 --> 414.08
crying out from outside some girl

411.84 --> 414.96
it wasn't in extreme anguish but it was

414.08 --> 419.12
like

414.96 --> 419.12
enough to catch my attention eventually

419.84 --> 425.52
and i yeah there was just this two girls

423.36 --> 427.12
outside in the middle of the snowstorm

425.52 --> 437.84
so

427.12 --> 437.84000000000003
what's this i'll get back to that

440.8 --> 445.12
nah i don't need to ban him for that

443.28 --> 448.15999999999997
just

445.12 --> 452.8
timeout is good enough for now

448.16 --> 456.319
we'll see what happens uh

452.8 --> 460.16
yeah but two girls down there

456.319 --> 461.44
way down there and yeah i don't know i

460.16 --> 462.16
think one of them might have like

461.44 --> 463.919
sprained an

462.16 --> 465.759
ankle or something but it's i was

463.919 --> 468.0
already wondering like uh

465.759 --> 469.68
it's two at night it's the middle of the

468.0 --> 473.199
snowstorm what the hell

469.68 --> 475.759
are you doing out there like what

473.199 --> 476.639
didn't ask but it was really weird i'm

475.759 --> 479.91900000000004
just wondering like

476.639 --> 481.759
how did they even get there at a time

479.919 --> 485.19899999999996
like that

481.759 --> 486.8
really bizarre so eventually i asked

485.199 --> 489.199
i had to ask pretty loud because of

486.8 --> 492.479
storm like do you need any help

489.199 --> 494.479
they were like yeah yeah so i was like

492.479 --> 494.87899999999996
oh damn okay now i asked now i have to

494.479 --> 497.35999999999996
go

494.879 --> 500.0
into the shitty weather but oh well put

497.36 --> 503.91900000000004
on the jacket and everything prepared to

500.0 --> 503.919
get outside and then they were gone

504.0 --> 507.28
went all the way over there not that i'm

506.24 --> 510.319
complaining it's

507.28 --> 510.96
just a short distance i'm going but they

510.319 --> 514.399
were gone

510.96 --> 516.7189999999999
just like what so they apparently didn't

514.399 --> 519.76
need any help or the prospect of

516.719 --> 523.279
arwyn coming down to help them

519.76 --> 526.08
i don't know gave them the forte

523.279 --> 527.92
to to just get up and do it themselves

526.08 --> 529.519
or something it was kind of weird

527.92 --> 531.68
that they just disappeared because they

529.519 --> 532.08
were laying down there i think for like

531.68 --> 534.8
five

532.08 --> 536.399
minutes in the middle of the storm and i

534.8 --> 540.0
wanted to help

536.399 --> 540.0
but then they were just suddenly gone

541.12 --> 543.44
weird

546.839 --> 549.839
huh

550.32 --> 554.5600000000001
oh yeah that's right happy birthday

552.24 --> 558.16
mandio

554.56 --> 563.8389999999999
today is amanda young's birthday

558.16 --> 563.8389999999999
gs is live good servant you mean

566.8 --> 577.8389999999999
i don't know i haven't checked out his

568.959 --> 577.8389999999999
activities in a long time

579.79 --> 582.8399999999999
[Music]

584.56 --> 589.1199999999999
anyway that happened kind of like one of

587.12 --> 591.92
the last things that happened

589.12 --> 593.04
but i've been very busy and i made a lot

591.92 --> 595.8389999999999
of notes

593.04 --> 595.8389999999999
from yesterday

597.2 --> 600.399
all right so let's go through them

598.959 --> 604.079
yesterday flutter

600.399 --> 608.24
early bird was good i like doing that

604.079 --> 611.519
and that yeah energy piled reserved

608.24 --> 613.76
from the day before uh

611.519 --> 619.839
premiere was also interesting from the

613.76 --> 619.8389999999999
flat earth debates

624.88 --> 628.8
i don't worry about the capsule and

626.48 --> 628.8000000000001
young

630.8 --> 634.079
do i consider flat earth that's the

632.959 --> 638.2399999999999
biggest actual

634.079 --> 646.399
rebellion of this age rebellion

638.24 --> 648.8
is it

646.399 --> 648.8
maybe

650.8 --> 654.959
i don't know is it a rebellion more like

653.36 --> 661.839
a grassroots struggle

654.959 --> 661.8389999999999
kind of thing

673.76 --> 680.16
i don't know rebellion kind of

677.12 --> 682.0
kind of suggests that there is some

680.16 --> 684.0
seizing of power happening

682.0 --> 685.6
which would be like effective

684.0 --> 687.36
competition or whatever

685.6 --> 690.16
i don't think we're really doing that

687.36 --> 694.0790000000001
this is much more a grassroot effort

690.16 --> 694.079
because we're not seizing power

694.16 --> 700.0
right like the globe priesthood

697.44 --> 700.8800000000001
and the whole apparatus will just keep

700.0 --> 703.12
going on

700.88 --> 703.92
we can't really seize the power we can

703.12 --> 707.279
only just

703.92 --> 710.3199999999999
struggle against it and that's a

707.279 --> 710.32
continual struggle

712.959 --> 718.2399999999999
so i don't know about rebellion

716.0 --> 720.32
terror i think i've been watching too

718.24 --> 723.6800000000001
many movies perhaps

720.32 --> 723.6800000000001
look who's talking right but

726.72 --> 731.839
want to skype me okay

736.399 --> 740.24
are you talking to territ 306 or me

739.36 --> 742.839
mandy you

740.24 --> 745.839
because i'm pretty sure you have me on

742.839 --> 745.839
skype

756.72 --> 761.0400000000001
right anyway let's get back to my list

758.72 --> 766.1600000000001
uh oh yeah i was a little bit on 24

761.04 --> 766.16
7 discord but it was

766.32 --> 769.7600000000001
it was really undoable because discord

769.279 --> 772.959
just

769.76 --> 776.48
keeps failing me it just

772.959 --> 779.1199999999999
very quickly makes me inaudible

776.48 --> 780.399
so i have to re-login like every two

779.12 --> 783.2
minutes

780.399 --> 784.16
just to be heard on on yeah on the other

783.2 --> 786.0790000000001
side

784.16 --> 787.519
so if i wait too long then i try to

786.079 --> 789.76
speak up again

787.519 --> 792.079
whether i was muted and then unmute or

789.76 --> 795.4399999999999
whatever if i just keep open

792.079 --> 798.16
like suddenly there's no more

795.44 --> 800.48
data going through and there's no

798.16 --> 802.959
explanation for it's really annoying

800.48 --> 803.839
so discord has been giving me a real

802.959 --> 806.3199999999999
hard time

803.839 --> 807.519
recently and been kind of discouraging

806.32 --> 810.1600000000001
because it's just

807.519 --> 810.16
undoable

810.88 --> 814.959
hope they fixed that because yeah if i'm

813.6 --> 818.16
gonna start

814.959 --> 820.4799999999999
a server on discord it might be handy

818.16 --> 822.48
if i could actually be heard on that

820.48 --> 824.399
server

822.48 --> 827.1990000000001
because if it doesn't function for me

824.399 --> 828.88
yeah how do i run

827.199 --> 830.88
the place you know that that's

828.88 --> 835.519
impossible so

830.88 --> 835.519
yeah just have to wait and see

835.839 --> 844.0
oh yeah dell was live that was funny

842.32 --> 847.1990000000001
you got a paper round to do well that's

844.0 --> 847.199
normally on wednesday

850.24 --> 855.92
but it highly depends on what

854.0 --> 857.12
yeah what's going to be on the on the

855.92 --> 859.279
headline

857.12 --> 861.36
because last time it like when it's

859.279 --> 863.76
really starting to and

861.36 --> 865.76
yeah encouraged to get the vaccine and

863.76 --> 867.6
[ __ ]

865.76 --> 868.959
that's where i draw the line then i'm

867.6 --> 872.32
just not gonna do it

868.959 --> 875.8389999999999
like last wednesday just not just

872.32 --> 878.88
in the paper bin like i'm not gonna

875.839 --> 880.8800000000001
get potentially dwelling people

878.88 --> 882.8
giving them a suggestion in hand to

880.88 --> 885.519
basically go and do that

882.8 --> 888.0
might get them killed you know i don't

885.519 --> 892.0
want to do that

888.0 --> 893.04
right but anyway yeah dell was live and

892.0 --> 896.48
he was

893.04 --> 899.04
going after simon dan big time

896.48 --> 900.0
he was really pissed off i think simon

899.04 --> 903.5999999999999
dan did some

900.0 --> 903.6
really arrogant video

904.079 --> 909.5999999999999
okay mr bozo had well you're just gonna

907.92 --> 914.24
have to

909.6 --> 914.24
do that somewhere else thank you

924.839 --> 930.0790000000001
creepy

927.68 --> 930.079
right

932.32 --> 936.0
but apparently yeah simon dan was was

934.48 --> 938.48
getting it although dell was

936.0 --> 939.44
having a lot of streaming issues like it

938.48 --> 941.279
was a constant

939.44 --> 942.48
fade in fade out uh what do you call it

941.279 --> 945.68
stalling

942.48 --> 948.16
very annoying but it was still

945.68 --> 950.399
fun to sit through that see him go off

948.16 --> 954.3199999999999
on simon and who absolutely deserves

950.399 --> 956.72
everything he he gets and more from us

954.32 --> 958.24
much more it's just that most are just

956.72 --> 959.9200000000001
unwilling to give it

958.24 --> 961.279
more because it's just not worth it

959.92 --> 964.56
really it's like

961.279 --> 968.24
no his main problem is that he is

964.56 --> 972.16
simon dan and you don't want

968.24 --> 972.16
that to rub off on you too much

972.88 --> 976.639
you know because he is his own worst

975.68 --> 979.4399999999999
nightmare

976.639 --> 979.44
he really is

979.68 --> 984.399
his own delusion and the arrogance that

982.56 --> 988.959
accidentally springs forth from it

984.399 --> 992.639
it's that's that's his problem

988.959 --> 993.68
right but it is fun especially when he

992.639 --> 996.0
gets so arrogant

993.68 --> 998.0
and starts supposedly attacking flat

996.0 --> 999.92
earthers in the most pathetic ways

998.0 --> 1003.519
imaginable

999.92 --> 1006.7199999999999
it is what it is

1003.519 --> 1008.8
satan man that no who

1006.72 --> 1011.6800000000001
why are you bringing that up mind god

1008.8 --> 1015.519
don't do that

1011.68 --> 1018.16
right after that yeah rob skiba was live

1015.519 --> 1020.399
i am still still subscribed to him and i

1018.16 --> 1023.8389999999999
do check him out sometimes

1020.399 --> 1025.12
and he has an open chat and he's doing

1023.839 --> 1028.799
his own thing like

1025.12 --> 1032.9589999999998
with his with his

1028.799 --> 1036.559
wise torah

1032.959 --> 1039.8390000000002
situation and seeing jesus and

1036.559 --> 1042.48
god in other words and all that stuff

1039.839 --> 1044.0
like to me like i i didn't really go

1042.48 --> 1045.6
with that

1044.0 --> 1047.36
all that time ago because that's been

1045.6 --> 1050.0
going on for years

1047.36 --> 1050.8799999999999
right but it was still interesting to

1050.0 --> 1053.52
sit

1050.88 --> 1055.44
through that show that live show had

1053.52 --> 1059.44
somebody on

1055.44 --> 1062.559
jessica ira ireland

1059.44 --> 1063.039
i think what's the name and it was a

1062.559 --> 1065.44
really

1063.039 --> 1066.72
fascinating conversation and they also

1065.44 --> 1069.2
went into well

1066.72 --> 1071.52
like channeling like skills and they

1069.2 --> 1072.64
have very specific type of wordings to

1071.52 --> 1075.2
reflect

1072.64 --> 1076.16
on scripture and all that but they were

1075.2 --> 1078.72
basically

1076.16 --> 1080.0
talking about well kind of what i get

1078.72 --> 1083.3600000000001
sorry of talk about

1080.0 --> 1086.96
oracling like i'm an oracle

1083.36 --> 1087.6789999999999
you just like you you have somebody ask

1086.96 --> 1090.16
a question

1087.679 --> 1092.3200000000002
you gave the answer i do it in my own

1090.16 --> 1096.3200000000002
way you know i

1092.32 --> 1096.32
it was just funny to notice that

1097.679 --> 1100.88
to see that in their own ways they're

1100.24 --> 1104.559
also

1100.88 --> 1107.0390000000002
doing what i am trying to do

1104.559 --> 1108.8799999999999
they're doing it according to that

1107.039 --> 1114.16
system

1108.88 --> 1117.8400000000001
and i'm much more well free-minded

1114.16 --> 1121.039
esoteric i'm not very

1117.84 --> 1124.1599999999999
like i'm very throwing away the exoteric

1121.039 --> 1125.28
like i'm discarding that actively the

1124.16 --> 1129.3600000000001
distances

1125.28 --> 1132.3999999999999
for myself from solidifying that

1129.36 --> 1133.9189999999999
and just taking the esoteric the meaning

1132.4 --> 1135.919
of it

1133.919 --> 1137.039
and just basically taking the

1135.919 --> 1140.3200000000002
information and

1137.039 --> 1144.0
the wider structure implications

1140.32 --> 1146.799
and then leaving the details

1144.0 --> 1148.24
which yields some different output

1146.799 --> 1150.4
effectively but

1148.24 --> 1151.6
it just i don't know man it was like

1150.4 --> 1153.6000000000001
this it just

1151.6 --> 1154.7199999999998
recognized it and it was fascinating to

1153.6 --> 1157.76
see and hey people

1154.72 --> 1159.52
checked were nice and they even

1157.76 --> 1161.12
basically said like yeah i don't really

1159.52 --> 1163.12
do this like that

1161.12 --> 1164.7199999999998
but i understand and i also put down

1163.12 --> 1168.8799999999999
like yeah

1164.72 --> 1171.919
i do not use god or jesus christ

1168.88 --> 1176.0800000000002
as real curse words but i do

1171.919 --> 1177.44
like call them call out to them or cry

1176.08 --> 1180.08
out to them

1177.44 --> 1181.6000000000001
like in frustration so i might be angry

1180.08 --> 1184.6399999999999
but then i don't

1181.6 --> 1186.8799999999999
project that anger onto jesus christ

1184.64 --> 1187.76
but i call for jesus christ for his

1186.88 --> 1192.3200000000002
assistance

1187.76 --> 1195.36
to help me out in the in the frustration

1192.32 --> 1195.36
that's how i

1196.16 --> 1201.28
well how i look at that and how i i do

1198.88 --> 1201.5200000000002
it's not something not an excuse i make

1201.28 --> 1204.84
up

1201.52 --> 1206.559
afterwards that's really like as it

1204.84 --> 1209.28
unfolds

1206.559 --> 1210.3999999999999
that's the things that i hold on to to

1209.28 --> 1213.44
that insider

1210.4 --> 1214.48
and that way i can still kind of be

1213.44 --> 1217.6000000000001
myself

1214.48 --> 1220.559
without basically spiritually

1217.6 --> 1223.9189999999999
blaspheming and then just

1220.559 --> 1228.1589999999999
getting all that that darkness from that

1223.919 --> 1230.72
right so it doesn't even matter like

1228.159 --> 1231.7600000000002
as much what you say it matters how you

1230.72 --> 1234.159
say it

1231.76 --> 1235.44
what's going on inside of you what are

1234.159 --> 1238.72
you doing

1235.44 --> 1239.2
in your mind and your spirit esoterics

1238.72 --> 1242.96
right

1239.2 --> 1242.96
it's all about esoterics to me

1246.84 --> 1249.84
right

1262.08 --> 1277.84
what why are you asking me that my god

1266.48 --> 1277.84
look i i wasn't there

1283.6 --> 1287.6
and i don't know man there's been so

1285.919 --> 1290.96
many stories

1287.6 --> 1293.36
so many so many angles to jesus christ

1290.96 --> 1296.96
what he is

1293.36 --> 1300.0
what really happened and even

1296.96 --> 1300.88
speculation on why the story was created

1300.0 --> 1304.4
as it is

1300.88 --> 1307.2800000000002
right i've delved into that myself so

1304.4 --> 1307.2800000000002
i don't know

1308.4 --> 1315.2800000000002
and really does it matter what i believe

1312.0 --> 1318.64
does it matter what i naturally

1315.28 --> 1322.08
feel about something that i've never

1318.64 --> 1327.44
personally i wasn't physically there

1322.08 --> 1327.4399999999998
just stories does it matter

1329.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
like or is this a like do i have to

1331.2 --> 1347.8400000000001
virtual signal like yes

1364.88 --> 1370.5590000000002
but yeah i think that i don't know

1368.4 --> 1375.8400000000001
can imagine being crucified it's going

1370.559 --> 1375.84
to be pretty damn painful

1386.84 --> 1389.84
so

1390.19 --> 1394.15
[Music]

1397.27 --> 1403.84
[Music]

1400.84 --> 1403.84
so

1413.44 --> 1420.0
right so is there any reason why you're

1416.559 --> 1420.0
bringing forth those questions

1423.679 --> 1430.3200000000002
all right anyway

1426.96 --> 1432.32
what's wrong bro skiba

1430.32 --> 1433.52
most of it it was really interesting to

1432.32 --> 1435.039
sit through and

1433.52 --> 1437.679
well it was kind of weird that they

1435.039 --> 1440.8799999999999
would say like

1437.679 --> 1441.76
but it's not even yeah esoterically i

1440.88 --> 1444.96
got it it's just

1441.76 --> 1445.76
exoterically it's kind of weird when rob

1444.96 --> 1447.679
skiba and

1445.76 --> 1450.1589999999999
and the woman basically just say like

1447.679 --> 1450.72
that like yeah we talk to god we talk to

1450.159 --> 1454.3200000000002
him

1450.72 --> 1456.24
and he talks back and then they explain

1454.32 --> 1458.24
how that experience is and i have a

1456.24 --> 1460.08
pretty good idea as to what's really

1458.24 --> 1462.32
happening there

1460.08 --> 1465.039
like from a mechanical standpoint and i

1462.32 --> 1467.279
even put some rough comments of that

1465.039 --> 1470.32
positive ones or basically analytical

1467.279 --> 1472.159
ones in the chat there

1470.32 --> 1475.039
and i think it has to do with the pineal

1472.159 --> 1480.24
gland and deprivation

1475.039 --> 1480.24
right that it actually kind of like

1480.48 --> 1486.32
adds pineal contact like

1483.84 --> 1487.4399999999998
this extra thing on top and then yeah

1486.32 --> 1493.12
you might actually

1487.44 --> 1496.559
communicate with god like it manifests

1493.12 --> 1500.1589999999999
the thing the interaction the connection

1496.559 --> 1503.279
like that like i i believe that he

1500.159 --> 1505.1200000000001
that that can happen i've had similar

1503.279 --> 1507.44
experiences myself

1505.12 --> 1509.36
and except it's so exaggerated and

1507.44 --> 1515.279
extreme that

1509.36 --> 1518.9599999999998
yeah it it's not as cohesive

1515.279 --> 1518.96
and therefore i'm like yeah

1519.039 --> 1531.12
it's a bit overwhelming all that stuff

1528.4 --> 1533.039
but but i get it like yeah okay he

1531.12 --> 1533.76
communicates with him and it's much more

1533.039 --> 1536.1589999999999
vivid

1533.76 --> 1537.2
like i communicate with god or i'd like

1536.159 --> 1543.5200000000002
to think so

1537.2 --> 1546.64
or but i just don't

1543.52 --> 1549.44
i'm not petitioning to his

1546.64 --> 1550.64
court like that because that's how i

1549.44 --> 1553.679
would see it like if i

1550.64 --> 1557.2
am really going to communicate with god

1553.679 --> 1560.799
has to be something really

1557.2 --> 1561.919
serious and not just something involving

1560.799 --> 1566.4
little of me

1561.919 --> 1566.4
you know and it's like

1568.24 --> 1573.1200000000001
if you're gonna petition for god it's

1570.24 --> 1573.1200000000001
almost like a

1577.76 --> 1583.919
a suggestion that you don't

1581.44 --> 1585.679
trust he already knows and has it under

1583.919 --> 1590.48
control

1585.679 --> 1592.5590000000002
you see do you understand

1590.48 --> 1594.799
that's kind of my issue with it because

1592.559 --> 1597.9189999999999
i think that people just kind of bother

1594.799 --> 1598.799
god a lot and then yeah he's unlimited

1597.919 --> 1601.679
and all that but

1598.799 --> 1601.679
still just

1601.84 --> 1608.24
i just try not to bother him

1605.039 --> 1610.8799999999999
i'm i trust that he know

1608.24 --> 1611.76
knows of my presence and of my struggles

1610.88 --> 1614.3200000000002
and

1611.76 --> 1616.64
and all that i don't have to bother him

1614.32 --> 1620.0
with that as much

1616.64 --> 1622.24
you know back in the past it was really

1620.0 --> 1623.6
when i had more uncertainties and more

1622.24 --> 1627.36
fear that i would be

1623.6 --> 1627.9189999999999
more more i have bigger tendency to

1627.36 --> 1631.52
really

1627.919 --> 1632.5590000000002
seek out the contact to really establish

1631.52 --> 1635.279
the contact

1632.559 --> 1637.76
now i just i just have to trust like

1635.279 --> 1639.36
yeah i remember yeah yeah it's all there

1637.76 --> 1642.559
but

1639.36 --> 1645.6789999999999
there's no use constantly

1642.559 --> 1648.32
trying to get that contact because

1645.679 --> 1648.96
that's like a waste of time i don't know

1648.32 --> 1654.0
this sounds

1648.96 --> 1657.6000000000001
maybe bad it's not

1654.0 --> 1657.6
i'm struggling with the words here

1659.36 --> 1663.76
it's like at some point it just

1661.36 --> 1667.1999999999998
shouldn't be necessary

1663.76 --> 1670.48
to do that constantly it should be

1667.2 --> 1670.48
resolved it should be

1671.279 --> 1675.279
less manifested

1675.36 --> 1679.12
like it should retract to the back of

1677.279 --> 1682.32
your mind and then happen

1679.12 --> 1685.4399999999998
through your subconscious

1682.32 --> 1687.6789999999999
does this make any more sense i don't

1685.44 --> 1690.48
know

1687.679 --> 1692.0
that's just how i've dealt with it and

1690.48 --> 1694.48
yeah

1692.0 --> 1697.44
i'm not a ritualist i'm not trying to

1694.48 --> 1699.919
tie this awareness of the creator and

1697.44 --> 1702.559
all that into

1699.919 --> 1703.76
like a ritual or a tradition type thing

1702.559 --> 1706.6399999999999
that i have to do

1703.76 --> 1706.64
only to

1707.12 --> 1714.2399999999998
to realize or to emphasize the creator

1710.88 --> 1717.3600000000001
and yeah and all those things rather

1714.24 --> 1717.36
i just try to

1718.24 --> 1722.159
realize it all consciously all of the

1721.679 --> 1725.2
time

1722.159 --> 1729.7600000000002
and then do my best to act

1725.2 --> 1732.3990000000001
in accordance but at the same time also

1729.76 --> 1733.12
realizing that it's like yeah at the

1732.399 --> 1734.799
same time

1733.12 --> 1736.1589999999999
you might know it but we're also

1734.799 --> 1739.36
outnumbered

1736.159 --> 1741.44
and we're also yeah burdened by our own

1739.36 --> 1744.6399999999999
seductions and

1741.44 --> 1747.44
ego issues and like like we had

1744.64 --> 1750.24
a devil that plays against you even from

1747.44 --> 1750.24
within side

1750.84 --> 1756.1589999999999
so

1753.12 --> 1759.36
just being aware of it all it is

1756.159 --> 1762.5590000000002
and it becomes really over complicated

1759.36 --> 1763.9189999999999
and the tendency for convolution is the

1762.559 --> 1767.84
main danger

1763.919 --> 1767.8400000000001
in the oversight of it all

1768.399 --> 1771.279
but i'm trying

1773.6 --> 1781.84
whoa what's going on in chat

1787.36 --> 1795.12
ufo sightings the government

1792.24 --> 1796.88
out of this world i don't know it all

1795.12 --> 1799.12
depends on the sighting

1796.88 --> 1801.44
look the problem is with the ufo

1799.12 --> 1804.6399999999999
sightings is that

1801.44 --> 1808.159
these things are happening after

1804.64 --> 1810.159
a complete picture has already been

1808.159 --> 1813.7600000000002
introduced to culture

1810.159 --> 1816.3200000000002
so all these things that are part of ufo

1813.76 --> 1818.399
sightings are already in our imagination

1816.32 --> 1823.84
through stories

1818.399 --> 1823.84
right so then who's to say

1824.399 --> 1837.84
what's really happening

1837.919 --> 1843.1200000000001
you know there's many ways of even

1840.08 --> 1846.559
thinking about this and about

1843.12 --> 1849.76
believing stories that are conjured up

1846.559 --> 1852.1589999999999
like you you could

1849.76 --> 1853.36
argue not necessarily say you should but

1852.159 --> 1857.1200000000001
you could

1853.36 --> 1861.039
argue that

1857.12 --> 1864.399
the ufo alien ideas and culture

1861.039 --> 1867.44
have been placed for us

1864.399 --> 1870.559
the believers the ones not in the know

1867.44 --> 1875.279
to conjure by our belief

1870.559 --> 1875.279
by our feelings towards it

1876.84 --> 1879.84
right

1879.919 --> 1886.3200000000002
and i have done some uh research way

1883.039 --> 1891.279
back in the past it would be

1886.32 --> 1894.72
in 1999 i think around that time

1891.279 --> 1896.72
yeah with my

1894.72 --> 1899.44
yeah my girlfriend from at the time who

1896.72 --> 1901.919
was really into ufos and we went to like

1899.44 --> 1903.919
these places where people supposedly had

1901.919 --> 1904.5590000000002
ufo abduction experiences and would talk

1903.919 --> 1906.96
about it and i

1904.559 --> 1908.32
investigated it as a psychology very

1906.96 --> 1911.039
carefully

1908.32 --> 1912.559
and it's like psychology for the

1911.039 --> 1913.44
approach and the understanding of the

1912.559 --> 1915.76
individual

1913.44 --> 1917.6000000000001
and then at the same time me arguing as

1915.76 --> 1919.76
i am just modeling things

1917.6 --> 1921.76
in the whole picture trying to figure

1919.76 --> 1924.8799999999999
out what they really experienced

1921.76 --> 1928.32
and my conclusion was absolutely 100

1924.88 --> 1930.0
certain that it was a pure spiritual

1928.32 --> 1933.039
experience that there was no

1930.0 --> 1936.799
physical thing that happened to them

1933.039 --> 1940.399
so they there might be this conjured

1936.799 --> 1943.76
perhaps or unleashed

1940.399 --> 1946.2399999999998
other dimensionally

1943.76 --> 1947.76
alien other dimensional aliens or extra

1946.24 --> 1950.48
dimensionals as i

1947.76 --> 1952.399
basically called them from early on

1950.48 --> 1955.44
extra dimensionals

1952.399 --> 1959.039
that are like that in

1955.44 --> 1961.3600000000001
the dream world and that can

1959.039 --> 1964.08
maybe even like sort of come forth from

1961.36 --> 1966.799
it becomes really bizarre like that

1964.08 --> 1969.36
so that's where they will probably be

1966.799 --> 1972.72
found and hey they can

1969.36 --> 1973.84
definitely make you dream that you're

1972.72 --> 1977.84
encountering

1973.84 --> 1977.84
encountering a ufo

1980.399 --> 1982.7199999999998
right

1984.799 --> 1988.32
if you care if if you're curious if you

1987.44 --> 1990.24
want to see

1988.32 --> 1991.6
and there's even people that actively

1990.24 --> 1993.919
try to do that it's like they're

1991.6 --> 1997.4399999999998
summoning it

1993.919 --> 1997.44
it's pretty bizarre

2002.559 --> 2008.08
but yeah personally i have never

2005.679 --> 2011.279
seen a ufo that i could confirm was

2008.08 --> 2011.279
actually a ufo

2016.88 --> 2021.919
although yesterday i did see a strange

2019.6 --> 2024.8799999999999
sight though i didn't know what that was

2021.919 --> 2024.88
there was a light

2025.679 --> 2028.88
that wasn't moving so that's already

2027.84 --> 2031.279
yeah

2028.88 --> 2032.48
but i i couldn't understand like why it

2031.279 --> 2035.679
was coming from

2032.48 --> 2038.24
exactly over there like what is there

2035.679 --> 2039.3600000000001
that there would be this light just at

2038.24 --> 2042.08
that height

2039.36 --> 2043.6789999999999
like there was a tower there although i

2042.08 --> 2047.279
don't think there is a tower there

2043.679 --> 2049.2000000000003
so maybe i've even seen a ufo yesterday

2047.279 --> 2050.879
i didn't even think about it or well i

2049.2 --> 2052.399
did think about it but then i forgot

2050.879 --> 2054.399
about it because

2052.399 --> 2055.44
i don't like to typically dwell on those

2054.399 --> 2057.359
things

2055.44 --> 2058.7200000000003
but maybe there was even something weird

2057.359 --> 2060.3199999999997
hanging

2058.72 --> 2062.48
somewhere up there about the city i

2060.32 --> 2063.599
don't know or it was a tower of some

2062.48 --> 2066.159
kind that i haven't

2063.599 --> 2067.839
really took notice of before so i'm as

2066.159 --> 2070.32
soon as the weather really clears up

2067.839 --> 2072.32
again i am going to look

2070.32 --> 2074.0
in the direction where i saw that and

2072.32 --> 2075.44
see if there is

2074.0 --> 2077.28
some kind of a building there in the

2075.44 --> 2089.839
distance because that

2077.28 --> 2089.8390000000004
that was a little weird

2094.399 --> 2101.5989999999997
why was he banned well

2097.599 --> 2101.599
i i don't really like people that

2104.96 --> 2108.88
that openly a hill

2111.68 --> 2117.839
you know so

2120.72 --> 2131.839
hey nathan oakley good to see you

2142.839 --> 2145.839
okay

2146.119 --> 2158.32
274 weeks

2148.72 --> 2173.839
to surpass nathan really

2158.32 --> 2173.839
you calculated it did you

2184.839 --> 2187.839
why

2227.44 --> 2235.839
right so anyway uh yeah continuing on

2232.64 --> 2237.92
as i said i had a list like whole list

2235.839 --> 2241.2
stuff you know it's usually not that big

2237.92 --> 2243.28
but there was many things

2241.2 --> 2247.2799999999997
also on recommendation of here we go

2243.28 --> 2247.28
again watched a bit of wakey wakeys

2247.76 --> 2252.4
and well he was doing kind of a clip

2250.16 --> 2252.3999999999996
show

2252.8 --> 2256.88
so even though it was pretty good

2255.52 --> 2260.0
quality

2256.88 --> 2260.48
eventually i gotta get tired of it after

2260.0 --> 2263.599
like

2260.48 --> 2266.88
i said 15 minutes of that video

2263.599 --> 2271.839
but good stuff if you're into like yeah

2266.88 --> 2271.839
news items curiosities clips

2271.92 --> 2275.04
did a pretty good job

2278.079 --> 2282.7200000000003
and then i rounded out watching the

2280.0 --> 2283.76
matrix i downloaded the matrix on high

2282.72 --> 2285.4399999999996
res

2283.76 --> 2287.92
and i think i'm allowed to do that

2285.44 --> 2291.119
because i literally have it on dvd and

2287.92 --> 2291.119
on blu-ray both

2291.2 --> 2296.16
so i think i have the privilege to

2292.96 --> 2300.56
literally download any form of matrix

2296.16 --> 2303.52
movie from any platform

2300.56 --> 2303.52
because i own it

2305.119 --> 2310.96
uh like

2308.32 --> 2312.8
i am allowed to own copies by any means

2310.96 --> 2313.52
necessary that's how i see it because i

2312.8 --> 2318.4
paid for it

2313.52 --> 2318.4
i have originals but yeah

2319.04 --> 2322.24
that was yeah it was good watching it

2321.119 --> 2327.839
again

2322.24 --> 2327.839
again again

2328.88 --> 2336.2400000000002
and this time i really try to look

2332.8 --> 2338.2400000000002
for moments in between

2336.24 --> 2339.68
you know the matrix has a pretty like

2338.24 --> 2343.1189999999997
it's pretty gripping and it's

2339.68 --> 2345.9199999999996
red it's quick paced in what happens

2343.119 --> 2349.119
but that kind of like carries you away

2345.92 --> 2352.2400000000002
into the story and on to the main focus

2349.119 --> 2354.56
as it were that is provided but i try to

2352.24 --> 2355.7599999999998
look especially for little details in

2354.56 --> 2359.2
between this time

2355.76 --> 2359.2000000000003
usually i don't even do that

2359.599 --> 2364.88
i'm typically somebody that really gets

2361.92 --> 2364.88
into the story

2365.04 --> 2369.2799999999997
with most movies unless the story really

2367.44 --> 2373.119
sucks or the actors are just

2369.28 --> 2373.119
radiating some inner [ __ ]

2374.96 --> 2378.4
but man it's a good movie it is really

2377.28 --> 2381.92
amazing and then

2378.4 --> 2383.359
imagining that it was 1999 when that hit

2381.92 --> 2386.88
the movie theaters

2383.359 --> 2386.88
like before 9 11

2387.599 --> 2392.1600000000003
what it was like what an incredible

2390.56 --> 2396.24
revelation

2392.16 --> 2400.64
it was many ways even though

2396.24 --> 2404.319
like the the 13th floor

2400.64 --> 2408.24
already kind of had that same

2404.319 --> 2412.079
idea except the matrix really

2408.24 --> 2415.2
made it into 3d 4d thing

2412.079 --> 2415.2000000000003
really perfected it

2418.56 --> 2439.839
yes it is amanda's birthday today indeed

2421.92 --> 2439.839
happy birthday amanda you

2450.839 --> 2453.839
twenty-five

2458.0 --> 2463.359
oh my god oh you shouldn't do that

2463.599 --> 2467.839
if you read the rules

2469.04 --> 2472.24
if you read the rules

2477.52 --> 2483.44
that all right but

2481.04 --> 2486.24
because your birthday is coming up i'm

2483.44 --> 2495.839
gonna get let this one go

2486.24 --> 2495.839
mind the god

2498.81 --> 2502.8289999999997
[Music]

2507.68 --> 2512.3999999999996
wow what a creep

2514.16 --> 2519.44
the rules are in the description box of

2516.64 --> 2519.44
the youtube

2521.359 --> 2528.24
just click on show

2524.8 --> 2537.8390000000004
more and then scroll down a little and

2528.24 --> 2537.839
halfway you see live chat rules

2592.24 --> 2607.839
hello mellow fellow

2595.44 --> 2610.7200000000003
oh you sick

2607.839 --> 2610.72
that's annoying

2618.839 --> 2622.24
right yes

2632.24 --> 2636.16
yeah that's that's good amanda young

2634.56 --> 2639.119
yeah i try to be too

2636.16 --> 2640.16
but it is it's kind of a transition

2639.119 --> 2642.8
though you know

2640.16 --> 2644.319
when you're young first you want to be

2642.8 --> 2647.599
old

2644.319 --> 2649.839
then like after 20

2647.599 --> 2652.1600000000003
you kind of want to be young again in

2649.839 --> 2655.2799999999997
many ways probably but then as you

2652.16 --> 2657.52
get older you start to realize the value

2655.28 --> 2659.44
of being around longer which you could

2657.52 --> 2661.28
say is age but it really hasn't

2659.44 --> 2662.96
to do with the number it's with the just

2661.28 --> 2664.96
the amount of time

2662.96 --> 2667.2
you've had to think about things and to

2664.96 --> 2669.92
let things sink in

2667.2 --> 2671.2799999999997
and resolve inner issues and then you

2669.92 --> 2674.839
start to realize that

2671.28 --> 2676.079
getting older actually makes things

2674.839 --> 2679.2799999999997
better

2676.079 --> 2683.28
only problem is that at some point yeah

2679.28 --> 2686.079
it stops that's really the only problem

2683.28 --> 2687.0400000000004
but still that's a bit of a mystery on

2686.079 --> 2690.96
its own

2687.04 --> 2693.599
i personally believe that

2690.96 --> 2695.52
if you have a real purpose and you

2693.599 --> 2697.44
really believe in it

2695.52 --> 2699.2
that can potentially expand your

2697.44 --> 2702.16
lifespan

2699.2 --> 2705.04
yes it's a bit dramatic maybe right but

2702.16 --> 2708.24
i believe that

2705.04 --> 2710.0
i think that old people really die

2708.24 --> 2713.68
when they get the feeling they are no

2710.0 --> 2713.68
longer necessary for anything

2714.0 --> 2733.839
so then

2717.359 --> 2733.839
i have an objective right

2757.28 --> 2760.48
having a long life is a curse these days

2759.599 --> 2775.839
nonsense

2760.48 --> 2775.839
minor god nonsense

2780.16 --> 2784.64
god mighty god look this is why i don't

2783.44 --> 2786.8
give you a wrench

2784.64 --> 2788.64
like what is this negative obsession

2786.8 --> 2792.0
with good servant

2788.64 --> 2792.0
why can't you just let it go

2792.56 --> 2796.0789999999997
oh he's a [ __ ] oh well you think so

2795.2 --> 2799.2799999999997
well

2796.079 --> 2799.92
oh guess what the internet has a lot of

2799.28 --> 2803.44
people

2799.92 --> 2806.4
that are really

2803.44 --> 2807.68
really dumb so does that mean that

2806.4 --> 2812.88
you've got to have to go

2807.68 --> 2812.8799999999997
after that like what is the point

2813.52 --> 2819.7599999999998
claims you're a satanist well you have

2816.72 --> 2822.48
kind of behaved pretty badly

2819.76 --> 2825.119
you know i i have to remind you every

2822.48 --> 2825.119
now and then

2825.52 --> 2830.319
that well you seem to be trying to

2828.16 --> 2830.64
better your ways i'm getting that vibe

2830.319 --> 2832.88
but

2830.64 --> 2836.24
yeah what happened happened and it's

2832.88 --> 2836.2400000000002
still not resolved so

2839.28 --> 2843.0400000000004
and yeah good servant is a little bit

2842.16 --> 2846.72
more

2843.04 --> 2846.72
purist like that

2847.599 --> 2852.4
let you on i can explain no no

2853.76 --> 2859.8390000000004
although who knows maybe at some point

2857.359 --> 2859.839
we could do

2861.359 --> 2869.359
you and good servant together on my show

2864.64 --> 2871.44
or a separate recording try it out

2869.359 --> 2873.839
see if we can get the misunderstandings

2871.44 --> 2873.839
out of the way

2879.839 --> 2883.2799999999997
right person who worships satan is a

2882.079 --> 2887.319
real satanist

2883.28 --> 2890.4
but at the same time

2887.319 --> 2895.04
esoterically a satanist

2890.4 --> 2900.1600000000003
is also somebody that knowingly

2895.04 --> 2903.2
speaks lies right

2900.16 --> 2904.0
that's becomes the doesn't have to be

2903.2 --> 2906.72
conscious

2904.0 --> 2907.599
necessarily well not conscious of what

2906.72 --> 2910.9599999999996
it means what

2907.599 --> 2913.599
what it is you're doing then but at

2910.96 --> 2914.2400000000002
the essence of it the spirit of it is

2913.599 --> 2917.52
also

2914.24 --> 2918.8799999999997
arrives on just knowing you're lying

2917.52 --> 2921.7599999999998
about something

2918.88 --> 2923.92
so if then from a consciousness

2921.76 --> 2925.92
perspective say good servant

2923.92 --> 2928.16
thinks about somebody else that they are

2925.92 --> 2929.2000000000003
knowingly lying about something and he

2928.16 --> 2931.1189999999997
believes that

2929.2 --> 2932.319
and it's very easy to hold on to that

2931.119 --> 2935.119
belief

2932.319 --> 2936.96
then he may grow conviction that that

2935.119 --> 2940.839
person is a satanist

2936.96 --> 2944.2400000000002
but it might also be a conspiracy minded

2940.839 --> 2946.319
mistake that happens a lot out there

2944.24 --> 2951.2
a lot of people get caught up in that

2946.319 --> 2951.2
guess what falls under cervany syndrome

2951.359 --> 2954.72
and good servant has some of that and so

2953.68 --> 2958.16
do you buddy

2954.72 --> 2962.72
mind the god so do you damn for sure

2958.16 --> 2966.3999999999996
right going after people wanting that

2962.72 --> 2966.3999999999996
right savonia syndra

2968.839 --> 2974.319
persecution

2971.119 --> 2977.28
on the personal at home persecution

2974.319 --> 2979.68
spiritual like right because nathan goes

2977.28 --> 2983.2000000000003
after people

2979.68 --> 2985.68
well for flat earth these very specific

2983.2 --> 2989.4399999999996
rules in

2985.68 --> 2989.44
in yeah how he does that

2991.28 --> 2995.119
so nathan effectively only goes after

2993.76 --> 2997.92
stupidity

2995.119 --> 2999.6800000000003
and people that blatantly lie to

2997.92 --> 3002.8
themselves

2999.68 --> 3002.7999999999997
when they approach him

3004.0 --> 3006.8
works out great

3008.48 --> 3013.839
and stable

3016.16 --> 3018.3999999999996
ah

3019.359 --> 3028.0
66 carbons of shaken his man no

3024.0 --> 3028.0
no that's just another look

3031.68 --> 3035.2799999999997
it's all esoteric and every time you

3034.319 --> 3039.359
latch on to

3035.28 --> 3041.6800000000003
exoteric aspects and start to reify them

3039.359 --> 3043.04
cross reference them then you get the

3041.68 --> 3046.3999999999996
the weirdest

3043.04 --> 3046.4
things out of it

3051.68 --> 3055.68
do you have a car that's not snow

3053.52 --> 3059.119
covered in snow no i don't have a car

3055.68 --> 3062.16
i haven't had a car for years

3059.119 --> 3063.6800000000003
i miss having a car i might get a car in

3062.16 --> 3066.7999999999997
the near future if

3063.68 --> 3068.5589999999997
well gti

3066.8 --> 3082.2400000000002
that thing happens that i talked about

3068.559 --> 3086.48
in the recent week

3082.24 --> 3086.4799999999996
i'm just get out of here

3088.559 --> 3093.52
stuff you're really nagging it's

3094.839 --> 3097.839
annoying

3099.47 --> 3103.5699999999997
[Music]

3136.839 --> 3139.839
it's

3146.559 --> 3154.1600000000003
yeah agm yeah the beast

3150.72 --> 3155.2799999999997
and a number so very cute by the way did

3154.16 --> 3159.839
you know that

3155.28 --> 3163.119
barcodes add up to 666

3159.839 --> 3166.5589999999997
yeah standardized worldwide

3163.119 --> 3170.1600000000003
industrial barcodes used for shopping

3166.559 --> 3174.4
yeah all right it's very cute right

3170.16 --> 3177.839
that's been there for 50 years

3174.4 --> 3181.839
right kind of slipped by like that

3177.839 --> 3181.839
right whatever

3190.0 --> 3198.319
so i don't know man

3195.119 --> 3198.319
i think the beast

3198.96 --> 3206.7200000000003
is a is like

3203.52 --> 3208.48
the preponderance of human activities

3206.72 --> 3210.0789999999997
it's like what's coming forth from the

3208.48 --> 3214.16
humans the humans make

3210.079 --> 3217.119
the beast and then they feed the beast

3214.16 --> 3219.359
it's their lives it's the corporations

3217.119 --> 3219.359
it's

3219.839 --> 3224.7999999999997
the powers the powers that sit on it

3226.559 --> 3231.119
so the beast is more like a spirit it's

3228.64 --> 3233.68
more like an extra dimensional thing

3231.119 --> 3235.119
an esoteric thing it's not really like a

3233.68 --> 3238.24
oh you point at

3235.119 --> 3240.8
a creature a thing

3238.24 --> 3241.7599999999998
a physical thing and that is the beast

3240.8 --> 3245.6800000000003
from the bible no

3241.76 --> 3245.6800000000003
no no no it's esoteric

3246.8 --> 3251.8390000000004
it's a rough description what's going on

3252.96 --> 3265.839
hold on

3276.839 --> 3279.839
so

3281.359 --> 3283.5989999999997
ah

3284.96 --> 3293.839
sound sounded like somebody was knocking

3286.88 --> 3293.839
on the door or something

3318.839 --> 3335.839
uh

3321.52 --> 3335.839
all right

3348.24 --> 3352.8799999999997
okay well ajm can you explain to me what

3351.119 --> 3355.119
the number of a man

3352.88 --> 3355.119
is

3360.64 --> 3365.1189999999997
because a number yeah that's a little

3363.2 --> 3366.8799999999997
bit issue it's like a mathematical thing

3365.119 --> 3371.76
so what is it

3366.88 --> 3377.839
is it that he is number 666 in a group

3371.76 --> 3377.8390000000004
does he have it written down or what

3395.92 --> 3399.92
uh what

3402.839 --> 3410.0789999999997
no

3405.68 --> 3413.1189999999997
good servant was sent by the deep states

3410.079 --> 3415.2000000000003
to discredit flat earth make it look

3413.119 --> 3419.839
stupid

3415.2 --> 3419.839
why no

3419.92 --> 3425.599
although i do agree that and this is

3422.079 --> 3428.88
like a really weird thing that if

3425.599 --> 3429.2000000000003
sun tzu strategy which they do apply is

3428.88 --> 3432.2400000000002
that

3429.2 --> 3434.24
if when your enemy is engaging

3432.24 --> 3435.68
in making themselves look like idiots

3434.24 --> 3438.9599999999996
and destroying themselves

3435.68 --> 3442.3999999999996
you should never interrupt them so

3438.96 --> 3447.52
i think in general people

3442.4 --> 3451.6800000000003
that they for some reason some reason

3447.52 --> 3454.0
don't see as much as a threat they do

3451.68 --> 3455.1189999999997
well effectively help them out as they

3454.0 --> 3457.44
would

3455.119 --> 3460.4
normally and those that they do see as a

3457.44 --> 3463.68
threat they will

3460.4 --> 3463.6800000000003
get in their way more

3464.799 --> 3477.28
right it's just a universal strategy

3474.48 --> 3479.2
so yeah let's just say roughly and i

3477.28 --> 3481.6800000000003
don't have any evidence for this but i

3479.2 --> 3482.799
could imagine that this would be the

3481.68 --> 3486.3999999999996
case

3482.799 --> 3488.0
that yeah youtube is not going to bother

3486.4 --> 3490.559
flat earthers that just

3488.0 --> 3492.24
for some reason one or another maybe

3490.559 --> 3495.6800000000003
they were born that way are

3492.24 --> 3498.4799999999996
just kind of dumb or

3495.68 --> 3499.839
like really seriously deranged very

3498.48 --> 3503.2
visibly whatever

3499.839 --> 3505.2
and then yeah let those guys

3503.2 --> 3506.72
be seen by everyone and everything

3505.2 --> 3510.0789999999997
whenever they look for

3506.72 --> 3511.5989999999997
that subject say flat earth that if they

3510.079 --> 3513.44
would talk about that

3511.599 --> 3514.88
and then yeah because that's what it

3513.44 --> 3516.799
wants it wants

3514.88 --> 3519.119
that association doesn't mean that the

3516.799 --> 3522.48
person would actually be in the know of

3519.119 --> 3525.52
it they might just be genuinely trying

3522.48 --> 3527.359
you know they don't have to be in the

3525.52 --> 3529.44
know

3527.359 --> 3531.68
because there is people of all shapes

3529.44 --> 3533.599
and sizes and sorts and psychological

3531.68 --> 3535.44
makeup all over the world

3533.599 --> 3537.2000000000003
that at one point or another get

3535.44 --> 3537.68
confronted with the subject and they

3537.2 --> 3542.0789999999997
might

3537.68 --> 3542.0789999999997
wanna be part of that

3542.24 --> 3547.359
but if you're really awesome individual

3545.28 --> 3549.28
and you're kind of like wealthy and you

3547.359 --> 3550.0789999999997
have a lot of charisma connections and

3549.28 --> 3553.6800000000003
all that

3550.079 --> 3554.799
well then the system does not want you

3553.68 --> 3558.5589999999997
to do that because

3554.799 --> 3561.7599999999998
then your action will echo

3558.559 --> 3562.2400000000002
on very hardly with people that would be

3561.76 --> 3565.92
drawn

3562.24 --> 3565.9199999999996
in by your power right

3566.16 --> 3570.3999999999996
so those get punished the ones with the

3568.4 --> 3572.559
the most radiant strength

3570.4 --> 3573.92
will often end up getting more punished

3572.559 --> 3577.3590000000004
than those that kind of have

3573.92 --> 3577.359
the arrangements of some kind

3584.48 --> 3587.76
good i'm really glad that made sense to

3587.28 --> 3588.77
you

3587.76 --> 3591.96
a real you

3588.77 --> 3591.96
[Music]

3592.0 --> 3601.839
because i really think that that is

3593.68 --> 3601.839
what's going on

3603.359 --> 3606.5589999999997
i don't think that good servant is a

3606.16 --> 3609.7599999999998
true

3606.559 --> 3613.0400000000004
bad actor i don't think so

3609.76 --> 3616.1600000000003
he just he gets carried away

3613.04 --> 3622.0
a little easy sometimes and

3616.16 --> 3622.0
he has occasional safari syndrome

3622.319 --> 3628.88
also like paranoia that comes from that

3625.68 --> 3631.04
so that's kind of his problem he's not

3628.88 --> 3635.839
like doing it on purpose to

3631.04 --> 3635.839
ruin everybody or something not at all

3636.16 --> 3640.64
no rather he's getting confused about

3638.319 --> 3640.64
things

3641.359 --> 3644.16
when that happens

3644.48 --> 3648.079
i don't know if he even does that if he

3647.119 --> 3649.92
if he isn't

3648.079 --> 3652.0
is like that anymore because i haven't

3649.92 --> 3654.079
watched his shows like i haven't seen

3652.0 --> 3658.079
him since i broke contact

3654.079 --> 3660.559
i had an email very short back and forth

3658.079 --> 3660.559
that's it

3668.559 --> 3672.3190000000004
also because i think kind of like i need

3670.72 --> 3675.359
to keep my distance from him

3672.319 --> 3675.68
like he needs his own space we we really

3675.359 --> 3679.119
like

3675.68 --> 3682.0789999999997
broke off it in a bad way

3679.119 --> 3684.319
and he just needs to he wanted to be out

3682.079 --> 3686.079
there in the world and do his thing

3684.319 --> 3689.7599999999998
and now he's doing it and then i feel

3686.079 --> 3689.76
like now i got just got to leave him

3696.839 --> 3699.839
alone

3701.04 --> 3714.319
and i hope he does the same

3712.0 --> 3717.359
right but i'm gonna round out the show

3714.319 --> 3717.359
it's only one hour
