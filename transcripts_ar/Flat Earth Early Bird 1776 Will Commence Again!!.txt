confusing bloody fake teret sock in

537.04 --> 541.1999999999999
there

538.2 --> 541.2
that's

542.279 --> 544.519

568.12 --> 571.12
annoying

578.8 --> 584.4799999999999
wow okay it

580.68 --> 587.0
seems it seems like these screwing

584.48 --> 587.0
around with

587.839 --> 593.399
my like blocking people is done it's

598.12 --> 601.12
stopped

606.0 --> 608.399
that's

608.68 --> 614.64
good cuz Hey there was a lot of people

613.0 --> 617.279
that certainly didn't have ranches

614.64 --> 617.279
yesterday

617.8 --> 621.3199999999999
so L low

624.5 --> 630.92
[Music]

628.04 --> 636.2199999999999
fruit

630.92 --> 636.2199999999999
[Music]

656.79 --> 661.04
[Music]

658.04 --> 661.04
you

664.839 --> 669.1600000000001
right but anyway yeah I've been having

666.68 --> 672.079
some tensions again I mean that was

669.16 --> 672.079
plenty clear

672.44 --> 676.48
yesterday I mean it goes up and

677.44 --> 685.1600000000001
down cuz believe it or not I really try

681.36 --> 685.16
to stay just perfectly

687.48 --> 693.44
come then some times the calling just

690.44 --> 696.639
becomes too appealing and I just get

693.44 --> 700.2
pulled into

696.639 --> 703.0790000000001
that and then like rage wi basically

700.2 --> 703.0790000000001
catches up with

709.72 --> 714.9200000000001
everything the weird thing is that after

712.279 --> 717.88
I kind of like done

714.92 --> 720.92
that there's like a huge sense of relief

717.88 --> 722.4399999999999
on my side like I got it off my

720.92 --> 725.4799999999999
chest

722.44 --> 728.2
right and then usually I kind of forget

725.48 --> 730.8000000000001
about it so I don't even really remember

728.2 --> 733.12
that much like what it was about I'm I'm

730.8 --> 737.3199999999999
guessing it's going to be me be being

733.12 --> 739.839
extremely vicious against en like fake

737.32 --> 739.839
zombie

741.92 --> 745.199
environmentalism and

745.72 --> 749.5600000000001
like

747.88 --> 753.16
Marxist

749.56 --> 756.7199999999999
culture derailing [ __ ]

753.16 --> 762.279
people and that kind of

756.72 --> 762.279
thing CU yeah I really despise those

775.199 --> 780.8389999999999
people but yeah I

777.839 --> 780.839
mean

780.92 --> 789.12
safe to say that I don't actually do the

784.44 --> 789.12
those types of things in the real world

789.32 --> 795.5600000000001
it's I mean it would definitely by Owen

792.44 --> 799.36
Benjamin standards fall under squirting

795.56 --> 799.3599999999999
it's like rage squirting in a

802.0 --> 811.079
way but I mean I instead of

806.8 --> 814.12
just like a complete G pass [ __ ] with

811.079 --> 816.399
just like Let The Rage out like through

814.12 --> 819.6
jealousy or Envy or something yeah

816.399 --> 822.92
because I'm not a gamma [ __ ] with I try

819.6 --> 825.6
to direct direct that part of me because

822.92 --> 825.5999999999999
it is in

825.639 --> 830.639
there now how you regard it is like is

828.68 --> 832.519
that really an original or is it kind of

830.639 --> 835.6
like scar tissue I kind of think that

832.519 --> 839.0
it's Scar Tissue cuz the feelings are

835.6 --> 841.759
directly linked to all these moments in

839.0 --> 845.279
the past where I was facing [ __ ] that

841.759 --> 848.279
was just so terrible but I mostly wasn't

845.279 --> 851.48
able to like do anything about it I had

848.279 --> 855.399
to like I sitting through like really

851.48 --> 860.24
dark [ __ ] I had to like completely lock

855.399 --> 863.079
myself in to like pretend like I either

860.24 --> 866.6
wasn't noticing what was really going on

863.079 --> 870.4399999999999
or I was too dumb to get it like I had

866.6 --> 873.44
to do that or I would have like

870.44 --> 876.6
well gone completely berserk and then

873.44 --> 878.399
ended up dead in the hospital or and or

876.6 --> 881.399
in

878.399 --> 881.399
jail

885.079 --> 889.6389999999999
so buffering still ah

892.8 --> 898.7199999999999
crap right so yeah people complain oh I

896.24 --> 900.88
really don't like it yeah well to be to

898.72 --> 904.1990000000001
be fair I really don't like it that much

900.88 --> 907.8389999999999
either when I go freaking

904.199 --> 912.92
berserk but what I go berserk

907.839 --> 912.9200000000001
on just really freaking frustrates

919.399 --> 929.12
me I just people that are so sunken deep

925.199 --> 931.959
through a cataclysm chain of bad

929.12 --> 934.68
decisions and priorities is just I I

931.959 --> 939.079
can't stand that I can't stand those

934.68 --> 943.88
people they they just bring out

939.079 --> 943.88
this this Wolverine in me and I just

944.36 --> 949.8000000000001
want I can't stand it I [ __ ] can't

947.519 --> 949.8
stand

951.48 --> 957.0790000000001
them I didn't know how to keep it to

954.72 --> 959.94
myself out there and all that but I mean

957.079 --> 964.16
that effect

959.94 --> 966.759
[Music]

964.16 --> 968.4399999999999
and why do they hate them so much right

966.759 --> 969.92
CU you could think oh they'll just end

968.44 --> 972.6800000000001
up destroying themselves yeah yeah

969.92 --> 976.639
that's that's so cute right that that's

972.68 --> 979.5999999999999
kind of like the consolidation price a

976.639 --> 981.9590000000001
consolation price at the end that they

979.6 --> 984.24
do indeed freaking end up destroying

981.959 --> 987.2399999999999
themselves yeah yeah but the issue is

984.24 --> 990.519
they take so much with

987.24 --> 990.519
them yeah

990.81 --> 999.9499999999999
[Music]

1000.8 --> 1003.959
and they're just being a bunch of

1002.68 --> 1009.8
dumbass

1003.959 --> 1012.7589999999999
Pawns of these supremely evil Mega

1009.8 --> 1017.0
oligarchs they're just being re they are

1012.759 --> 1019.5600000000001
being pawns and and the ones that win

1017.0 --> 1021.68
are the ones that are using them as

1019.56 --> 1026.039
pawns and I'm so sick of

1021.68 --> 1028.54
it I'm so sick of people just being weak

1026.039 --> 1033.16
and then being used as

1028.54 --> 1036.06
[Music]

1033.16 --> 1040.6190000000001
pawns by

1036.06 --> 1040.619
[Music]

1041.079 --> 1048.079
evil

1044.0 --> 1051.72
anyway is it bad to have for us to have

1048.079 --> 1052.799
Hayden inside of us yeah technically

1051.72 --> 1054.84
it's

1052.799 --> 1058.48
unhealthy but I

1054.84 --> 1061.9599999999998
mean reasons for hatred

1058.48 --> 1061.96
are are

1062.799 --> 1068.8799999999999
there it's like there there's a light

1065.76 --> 1070.16
shining through this crack somewhere in

1068.88 --> 1073.1200000000001
the

1070.16 --> 1075.76
hole and how you look at it well it can

1073.12 --> 1078.559
really hurt you or you could look at it

1075.76 --> 1080.4
from another angle or use another lens

1078.559 --> 1084.799
and

1080.4 --> 1087.88
then perhaps actually see more detail

1084.799 --> 1092.32
and learn about it all and even why it

1087.88 --> 1093.96
hurt you or agitated you so much right

1092.32 --> 1096.2
the problem with me is I've already

1093.96 --> 1098.919
taken those lenses I've already looked

1096.2 --> 1104.0
there and now it's just

1098.919 --> 1104.0
there for a very very long time

1107.32 --> 1110.32
like

1111.62 --> 1114.87
[Music]

1116.08 --> 1124.36
H yeah the teret that's cool but uh like

1120.64 --> 1125.8400000000001
I'm just overall downgrading downgrading

1124.36 --> 1129.799
wrench

1125.84 --> 1133.1589999999999
situations uh it it's still going the X

1129.799 --> 1135.679
the test is still going so there's just

1133.159 --> 1138.0
a couple of

1135.679 --> 1140.64
wrenches and I base those wrenches

1138.0 --> 1143.039
really on that you have been like really

1140.64 --> 1144.64
actively moderating for me when the

1143.039 --> 1147.48
trolls come

1144.64 --> 1150.24
by and for the rest I'm leaving most of

1147.48 --> 1153.76
the ranches out because I had dude

1150.24 --> 1154.88
there's been people like messing around

1153.76 --> 1158.64
with my

1154.88 --> 1160.3200000000002
moderation for like almost a year

1158.64 --> 1164.3600000000001
okay I

1160.32 --> 1167.08
checked right like a what is it 15

1164.36 --> 1170.039
minutes ago it's like one of the first

1167.08 --> 1172.1589999999999
days where hasn't been messing around

1170.039 --> 1174.679
with my moderation

1172.159 --> 1178.0800000000002
okay

1174.679 --> 1182.159
so you'll just have to

1178.08 --> 1182.1589999999999
do with what you got right

1190.919 --> 1197.24
now Happ me ban yeah there's no need ter

1195.0 --> 1201.32
there's no

1197.24 --> 1203.95
need there's there's like there's a

1201.32 --> 1207.1599999999999
handful of wrenches right

1203.95 --> 1207.16
[Music]

1484.64 --> 1490.5590000000002

1490.559 --> 1497.48
sloppy I

1492.96 --> 1499.52

1499.52 --> 1506.36
cing he

1501.559 --> 1508.2
gets like expressively lazy so it's just

1506.36 --> 1509.8799999999999
like no I'm not going to preface this

1508.2 --> 1511.96
entire thing even though you really

1509.88 --> 1514.2
should it's just like no no no it's just

1511.96 --> 1516.48
10,000 ft it's not just like oh yeah

1514.2 --> 1519.279
mathematically it is calculated to be a

1516.48 --> 1521.039
10,000 is not actually there that can be

proven you didn't do that it's just like

1521.039 --> 1525.919
no it's at 10,000 ft because he's kind

1523.12 --> 1525.9189999999999
of a lazy

1526.679 --> 1533.279

1788.24 --> 1792.279
day 11 a.m.

1792.76 --> 1795.76
I

1796.32 --> 1799.32
right

1800.44 --> 1806.3990000000001
like three

1802.48 --> 1806.3990000000001
roughly 3 hours from

1812.88 --> 1816.1200000000001

1826.24 --> 1829.24
right

1838.72 --> 1844.029
[Music]

1856.24 --> 1859.24
ah

1871.2 --> 1877.24
man it did I check the temperature

1874.24 --> 1880.48
yet I don't think it

1877.24 --> 1882.96
did this feels really cold yeah freaking

1880.48 --> 1886.6390000000001
8° man what the

1882.96 --> 1889.3990000000001
hell and I wonder I'm like I'm like

1886.639 --> 1891.559
having a right here and I feel cold like

1889.399 --> 1891.559
this

1892.08 --> 1896.96
is high humidity yeah that's not

1898.559 --> 1904.6
helping like this is

1901.919 --> 1906.88
like it could be worse but this is like

1904.6 --> 1909.639
kind of bone aching

1906.88 --> 1913.7990000000002
weather cold and

1909.639 --> 1917.6
moist not like Misty yet it's not water

1913.799 --> 1920.279
cold or anything water cold like at 1°

1917.6 --> 1922.4399999999998
and then this moist that's the worst

1920.279 --> 1924.0
like all your bones will start hurting

1922.44 --> 1925.8400000000001
especially if you like have a bit of

1924.0 --> 1928.96
sensitivity with

1925.84 --> 1930.799
that but I mean it this is that's why I

1928.96 --> 1934.0
said that that's typically weather

1930.799 --> 1934.0
winter here in the

1940.36 --> 1946.559
Netherlands right cuz our Winters they

1942.84 --> 1948.4399999999998
don't they don't get dry because well

1946.559 --> 1950.32
there's a lot rivers in the Netherlands

1948.44 --> 1955.24
and

1950.32 --> 1958.24
we're on the ocean coast and all that so

1955.24 --> 1961.0
there's just there's going to be moist

1958.24 --> 1963.08
around but then it becomes bone chilling

1961.0 --> 1965.36
type

1963.08 --> 1966.96
weather even though it's not even

1965.36 --> 1969.9599999999998
freezing

1966.96 --> 1969.96
often

1976.039 --> 1979.039
anyway

2000.039 --> 2002.919
I'm just thinking

2004.159 --> 2008.7600000000002
like I would really like to have like

2006.679 --> 2011.48
prop for dinner

2008.76 --> 2013.519
later but my current and this is not

2011.48 --> 2017.159
even because oh I didn't get enough from

2013.519 --> 2020.0
you guys no I got I got well I dare I

2017.159 --> 2023.519
say plenty I got enough at least to like

2020.0 --> 2026.12
get get even with some

2023.519 --> 2028.3990000000001
debts cuz it was getting really

2026.12 --> 2031.9189999999999
bad

2028.399 --> 2034.639
and but I got directly available enough

2031.919 --> 2037.3600000000001
perhaps to get like a proper dinner

2034.639 --> 2038.12
again cuz eating french fries fries and

2037.36 --> 2041.24
all

2038.12 --> 2042.559
that I mean it works especially when I

2041.24 --> 2045.559
add the

2042.559 --> 2045.559
onions

2048.76 --> 2056.0400000000004
but my body like in this weather it just

2051.8 --> 2059.2000000000003
starts longing for like beef

2056.04 --> 2063.919
sausages of of different

2059.2 --> 2065.879
types like chipolatas or like the BR was

2063.919 --> 2068.1589999999997
or a smoked

2065.879 --> 2072.5989999999997
sausage

2068.159 --> 2074.56
right for yeah and typical Butters like

2072.599 --> 2076.52
I mean butter just lots of butter and

2074.56 --> 2079.48
that's like the ultimate solution like

2076.52 --> 2082.679
when you if I had the opportunity to eat

2079.48 --> 2085.599
a meal like that every day

2082.679 --> 2087.96
dude I would like never be complaining

2085.599 --> 2091.04
about the cold

2087.96 --> 2093.48
probably unfortunately I it it can

2091.04 --> 2093.48
afford

2094.28 --> 2101.2000000000003
that I have to space it out and just

2096.919 --> 2101.2
just settle with french

2102.079 --> 2109.1600000000003
fries in between anyway do my roommates

2106.32 --> 2109.1600000000003
share dinner

2109.52 --> 2116.839
no we are not like a a room commune type

2113.96 --> 2116.839
setup here

2121.0 --> 2125.56
thanks no we are very Anarchist and it's

2123.88 --> 2128.6400000000003
like if you get along with another

2125.56 --> 2132.16
roommate really well then well yeah you

2128.64 --> 2134.7599999999998
could do whatever you want but I

2132.16 --> 2136.16
mean there's been like roommates before

2134.76 --> 2139.0
that really got along and that they

2136.16 --> 2141.2
would always like cook together and I I

2139.0 --> 2143.68
think that's great I mean makes me happy

2141.2 --> 2145.1189999999997
it's just that like yeah you're not

2143.68 --> 2149.2
eating

2145.119 --> 2151.119
organic that's not going to work for me

2149.2 --> 2154.2799999999997
and I don't want to like force my

2151.119 --> 2156.04
organic standards on you either because

2154.28 --> 2158.8
that's going to be very inconvenient for

2156.04 --> 2158.8
you

2160.44 --> 2166.16
and I'm really good at just cooking for

2162.8 --> 2170.4
one I've become really good at it really

2166.16 --> 2174.8799999999997
efficient like there is zero sorry not

2170.4 --> 2174.88
six zero leftovers at the

2175.079 --> 2182.52
end I I never throw food away ever like

2179.599 --> 2184.52
not a little bit not even the peels of

2182.52 --> 2188.72
the potatoes I eat the peels of the

2184.52 --> 2188.72
potatoes it goes right in the stew

2193.319 --> 2199.119
and I don't peel the beets either it's

2196.56 --> 2201.52
just like I just eat all of it and it's

2199.119 --> 2205.04
great like I just I don't want to eat

2201.52 --> 2207.359
dirt like I do scrub off the sand and

2205.04 --> 2210.079
all that which is great like good

2207.359 --> 2213.52
potatoes especially potatoes should have

2210.079 --> 2216.319
like the sand still on it

2213.52 --> 2218.56
because that's just all extra minerals

2216.319 --> 2221.2799999999997
it's got going to absorb at the last

2218.56 --> 2223.0
minute kind of thing but yeah you have

2221.28 --> 2225.119
to wash that off but other than that

2223.0 --> 2228.88
it's just like nope I cut them in pieces

2225.119 --> 2232.2000000000003
I cook them and I stew them and I eat it

2228.88 --> 2235.1600000000003
just like that peels and all it's

2232.2 --> 2236.4399999999996
fantastic best decision I ever made eat

2235.16 --> 2239.359
the

2236.44 --> 2243.4
peels I was so like at as a kid just

2239.359 --> 2246.24
like no and why because it's ugly and

2243.4 --> 2248.599
it's weird it's like e but the potato is

2246.24 --> 2251.839
so awes awesome like

2248.599 --> 2251.839
yeah what

2332.0 --> 2337.4
would it

2333.4 --> 2339.52
be if we figure it out a way

2337.4 --> 2342.64
to basically

2339.52 --> 2345.319
not have to ban

2342.64 --> 2347.44
people but what if we just gave them

2345.319 --> 2350.119
like a year

2347.44 --> 2352.0
timeout then I could

2350.119 --> 2355.8
unban

2352.0 --> 2361.0
everything and just whenever it pops

2355.8 --> 2363.2400000000002
up it's just like make sure it's not

2361.0 --> 2365.359
don't do it on a rush just like ban them

2363.24 --> 2367.2
out for like time them out for a year

2365.359 --> 2370.2799999999997
they're not going to be on the list they

2367.2 --> 2372.7

weird maybe I just have to turn

2697.28 --> 2701.3190000000004
some reason screwing up the
