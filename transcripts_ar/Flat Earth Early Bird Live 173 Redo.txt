[Music]

32.1 --> 43.21
[Music]

39.239 --> 47.29
good morning and welcome to flatter the

43.21 --> 52.120000000000005
earlybird number 173 i'm your host

47.29 --> 56.8
Arwen and yeah this is a second startup

52.12 --> 59.41
stream because yeah I had an open panel

56.8 --> 62.169999999999995
and went really nice for an hour and I

59.41 --> 66.22
did a lot of talking but then somebody

62.17 --> 68.56
decided to porn bomb me and I'm pretty

66.22 --> 70.72
sure it's P Mars and that means he's

68.56 --> 73.93
banned for life forever

70.72 --> 77.02
we will never hear his voice on my

73.93 --> 79.36000000000001
channel ever again ever again

77.02 --> 82.24
as soon as I hear his voice instantly I

79.36 --> 83.95
will kick anything relating to him so

82.24 --> 87.69999999999999
whether it be a sock whether it be him

83.95 --> 88.27000000000001
he's out of here forever and I know it

87.7 --> 93.31
was him

88.27 --> 95.83
was his voice and he was in here in the

93.31 --> 98.02
panel as well so yeah you may be hanging

95.83 --> 101.95
around in panel but you're never getting

98.02 --> 106.27
on my show ever again and I'm just lucky

101.95 --> 108.849
enough that I was able to yeah delete

106.27 --> 113.94999999999999
the entire hangout if when it was still

108.849 --> 116.38000000000001
uploading so yeah I it didn't register a

113.95 --> 122.89
strike there's nothing to strike about

116.38 --> 126.97
it so yeah I may just get out of this

122.89 --> 130.33
undamaged but I am very seriously pissed

126.97 --> 135.069
off that somebody felt that it would be

130.33 --> 138.489
okay to do that when I've been anything

135.069 --> 142.08999999999997
but really directly offensive to anyone

138.489 --> 145.989
or even to the ballers I know I do get a

142.09 --> 149.83
little bit yeah bit of rough language

145.989 --> 152.41
sometimes when I lose my patience but I

149.83 --> 158.44
don't think I deserve this it's

152.41 --> 161.739
absolutely bizarre to me that somebody

158.44 --> 165.21
actually did this oh well there go my

161.739 --> 167.709
hundred and twenty-five down votes I

165.21 --> 170.53
guess maybe the

167.709 --> 173.26
the socks reached a critical mass and

170.53 --> 177.519
they just couldn't help it anymore they

173.26 --> 180.64
just came to a well literal ejaculation

177.519 --> 184.17000000000002
ending and just had to do it because

180.64 --> 190.67999999999998
they're very pathetic people

184.17 --> 196.29899999999998
hmm so but yeah news show new chances

190.68 --> 199.9
same weather good rainy bit cloudy

196.299 --> 208.62900000000002
sometimes sunny not super cold not very

199.9 --> 213.579
warm either also yeah I really messed up

208.629 --> 216.129
there with my with my skills I was

213.579 --> 218.56
obviously not prepared I panicked when

216.129 --> 220.91899999999998
it happened I got adrenaline and I

218.56 --> 223.09
completely lost track it's really

220.919 --> 225.76000000000002
freaking annoying it took me like a

223.09 --> 228.4
minute I was ridiculous I should have

225.76 --> 230.739
been responding exactly in a certain

228.4 --> 231.84900000000002
routine within two seconds and I didn't

230.739 --> 233.65
and I'm kind of disappointed that

231.849 --> 237.47899999999998
although it's the first time that ever

233.65 --> 241.26000000000002
happened hope it never happens again

237.479 --> 244.479
but yeah I could have like just

241.26 --> 246.42999999999998
immediately go yeah I even lost track of

244.479 --> 248.62
where OBS was that freaking

246.43 --> 249.04000000000002
disorientation because I could have gone

248.62 --> 251.739
there

249.04 --> 253.38899999999998
just click the intro at transit and then

251.739 --> 255.909
just figure it out as the interest

253.389 --> 262.06
playing in this case as soon as I found

255.909 --> 264.34
it I just clicked exit stream and I

262.06 --> 268.27
should have just probably clicked stop

264.34 --> 273.4
streaming but just exit just exit exit

268.27 --> 276.82
exit yeah shows you when you're not used

273.4 --> 280.57
to a situation smoke can be a lot harder

276.82 --> 284.039
than it would appear just theoretically

280.57 --> 288.28
just thinking about it anyway I'm back

284.039 --> 290.979
yeah I guess share the show even on

288.28 --> 294.46
Facebook because I do denounce myself

290.979 --> 296.8
for all my bigotry and oh my going

294.46 --> 299.469
against the mainstream narrative and all

296.8 --> 301.09000000000003
the conspiracy theories and I denounce

299.469 --> 303.52
myself and all that

301.09 --> 305.65
but I will definitely do it and I will

303.52 --> 308.2
absolutely mean everything I say

305.65 --> 309.54999999999995
and I'll be honest about everything that

308.2 --> 311.889
I say

309.55 --> 314.41
but I'll denounce it so it should be

311.889 --> 317.639
good to share on Facebook so yeah if you

314.41 --> 320.53000000000003
have Facebook then share it there and

317.639 --> 322.36
also in other platforms of course again

320.53 --> 323.73999999999995
because the other previous hangout is

322.36 --> 327.87
completely deleted

323.74 --> 331.36
I did get some super chats and I thank

327.87 --> 333.82
everyone that did that I I forgot who it

331.36 --> 337.90000000000003
was I'm sorry I could look it up in a

333.82 --> 342.31
registry but at at least I do remember

337.9 --> 345.13
very clearly that brand em added herself

342.31 --> 346.99
on my patreon as a my second supported

345.13 --> 354.7
there so thanks again for that

346.99 --> 358.78000000000003
just to do that on record right

354.7 --> 365.669
jaren did a good video we actually had a

358.78 --> 365.669
debate with Riley about it was good

366.6 --> 380.91900000000004
right so let me share some insight

372.12 --> 384.85
thingies from Skype so I can just show

380.919 --> 392.59
you what kind of a man slick James

384.85 --> 395.37
Johnson is right oh just show him what

392.59 --> 395.36999999999995
kind of a guy

398.0 --> 404.9
all right so some [ __ ] that's me

402.33 --> 409.95
just porn bomb me and Oh blah blah blah

404.9 --> 412.73999999999995
go through of course yeah and I said it

409.95 --> 416.31
was Pete Mars and then oh I always like

412.74 --> 423.63
P Mars and then I delete history of P

416.31 --> 428.43
Mars you are the man so yeah you know

423.63 --> 436.44
what he's saying it's some real

428.43 --> 440.04
character here he's actually he get that

436.44 --> 443.85
is actually saying porn bombing is good

440.04 --> 448.49
basically because it was me so he's so

443.85 --> 453.39000000000004
utterly personally politicized but

448.49 --> 457.02
politicizing purely on his person on the

453.39 --> 459.75
on his personal feelings of people that

457.02 --> 464.78
he'll just promote that kind of thing

459.75 --> 470.76
that's super super disgusting and

464.78 --> 474.91999999999996
sociopathic and well yeah slip actually

470.76 --> 477.84
said he was a pimp before so that's yeah

474.92 --> 481.92
being sociopathic is not that far off

477.84 --> 487.28
probably he obviously doesn't really get

481.92 --> 491.19
morality so yeah just just needed to

487.28 --> 494.90999999999997
share some of that and by the way yeah

491.19 --> 496.83
the rest of Skype kind of agree with me

494.91 --> 499.29
that that's really a disgusting thing to

496.83 --> 501.93
say say it's okay to porn bomb somebody

499.29 --> 503.70000000000005
you know to troll somebody to be in

501.93 --> 508.62
their faces okay that can be annoying

503.7 --> 511.97999999999996
but yeah porn bombing okay what that is

508.62 --> 514.979
what that does if somebody doesn't take

511.98 --> 517.95
care of that quickly enough then people

514.979 --> 520.5300000000001
will report it usually the porn bomber

517.95 --> 523.2800000000001
themselves and then the channel will get

520.53 --> 527.5799999999999
a strike and because of that they can't

523.28 --> 530.1899999999999
livestream anymore okay and when you

527.58 --> 531.3000000000001
can't live stream there's all kinds of

530.19 --> 533.3100000000001
issues and that

531.3 --> 536.16
can actually can cause you to de

533.31 --> 537.54
monetize completely and I would mean

536.16 --> 540.4499999999999
that yeah

537.54 --> 544.26
that's literally a an attack on my

540.45 --> 548.34
business technically if I could with

544.26 --> 552.38
definitive results identify the one who

548.34 --> 556.2
did it I could sue them for damages not

552.38 --> 558.45
that that would be financially viable

556.2 --> 559.83
thing to do because I get very little

558.45 --> 562.5
from it but for a bigger channel it

559.83 --> 568.0500000000001
would it's literally an attack on

562.5 --> 570.57
business to do that it's you make

568.05 --> 571.3199999999999
yourself liable for being sued if you do

570.57 --> 575.0400000000001
something like that

571.32 --> 576.87
just just sharing that so and but

575.04 --> 577.4699999999999
apparently slick thinks that's perfectly

576.87 --> 579.63
fine

577.47 --> 582.48
it's perfectly fine to pretty much do

579.63 --> 594.66
something that yeah could be considered

582.48 --> 597.35
criminal so ap Mars see you in chat

594.66 --> 601.79
there did you did you actually do that

597.35 --> 601.7900000000001
did you do that P Mars

607.9 --> 611.74
I don't know from your two comments I'm

609.85 --> 617.1
getting the feeling almost like you did

611.74 --> 617.1
oh you did not right so who did that

622.95 --> 628.1500000000001
okay P Marsha you're always very good at

625.63 --> 631.42
it just always plainly denying even

628.15 --> 633.4
though every time it's always your voice

631.42 --> 636.9399999999999
you popping up somewhere and then people

633.4 --> 638.8
getting porn bombs so you can call it

636.94 --> 641.95
whatever you want you can get into this

638.8 --> 646.3599999999999
raging Fame ooh that could last the rest

641.95 --> 649.1500000000001
of your life but I'm never ever letting

646.36 --> 651.79
you on my life show again whether it was

649.15 --> 655.3199999999999
you or not because every time you pop up

651.79 --> 658.99
that's when poor embalming happens and

655.32 --> 661.21
I'm sick of it you can never ever be

658.99 --> 665.26
trusted again as far as I'm concerned

661.21 --> 667.3000000000001
ever it's never gonna be restored this

665.26 --> 671.79
is not an ego thing this is a trust

667.3 --> 671.79
thing I will never trust you again ever

673.5 --> 681.07
yeah they're trying to frame I think

678.73 --> 682.57
you're trying to frame you I think

681.07 --> 687.09
you're you're being an

682.57 --> 687.09
attention-grabbing piece of [ __ ] a

687.87 --> 693.7
mental patient it's very serious mental

691.66 --> 695.7099999999999
patient that attacks people and then

693.7 --> 698.8900000000001
claims somebody else is framing them I

695.71 --> 701.71
think that's what you are you're a sick

698.89 --> 707.17
person and you're never coming on coming

701.71 --> 709.63
on my live stream again ever and you can

707.17 --> 712.0
hang around I'm not even gonna ban you

709.63 --> 715.42
in chat because but you're just never

712.0 --> 718.66
gonna get on my show again soon as I

715.42 --> 721.5899999999999
you're identified in any way instantly

718.66 --> 721.5899999999999
kick you out

722.22 --> 728.519
yes so you know all right but yeah

725.459 --> 742.319
flattered at the early bird it's still

728.519 --> 744.7090000000001
living it's still running right sleeping

742.319 --> 744.709
warrior

753.38 --> 762.41
let's see I guess I could try to restart

758.3 --> 766.6999999999999
up the panel but I can't the problem is

762.41 --> 769.3399999999999
I can't really open up the panel at this

766.7 --> 778.76
point I'm not gonna do that but I will

769.34 --> 782.21
just start up a new panel and just throw

778.76 --> 785.84
out the link through Skype because Riley

782.21 --> 793.5500000000001
doesn't wanna talk then I kind of want

785.84 --> 796.76
to have him on my show is the show it is

793.55 --> 802.3
still going live right yeah it is let me

796.76 --> 802.3

1019.42 --> 1026.86
Nathan Oakley maybe I don't know try it

1024.43 --> 1031.23
Monday or something or maybe

1026.86 --> 1031.2299999999998
ball-busters would be very early for you

1034.98 --> 1044.98
yeah why not ruin because he doesn't get

1041.35 --> 1047.6499999999999
on skype with me as far as I know I

1044.98 --> 1050.38
don't think I have him on skype if he's

1047.65 --> 1052.7800000000002
if he contact me on skype I'll send in

1050.38 --> 1054.8500000000001
the leg sure he doesn't share it because

1052.78 --> 1058.8899999999999
if suddenly then trolls start to pop up

1054.85 --> 1058.8899999999999
then he's banned for life as well

1063.96 --> 1068.6200000000001
[Applause]

1073.1 --> 1076.26
[Applause]

1082.39 --> 1110.76
Colleen Williamson I do okay let me

1088.99 --> 1110.76
check I don't know are you sure

1112.799 --> 1123.25
look I thought through if if you have me

1116.289 --> 1125.799
on skype then sent sure hey hello e okay

1123.25 --> 1128.769
so if roof says he has me on skype so if

1125.799 --> 1133.69
you do roof then sent me a message there

1128.769 --> 1134.98
so I can send you a link sorry man I

1133.69 --> 1138.5800000000002
didn't I'm a bad shot open as I thought

1134.98 --> 1141.279
you had it opened I couldn't see who it

1138.58 --> 1144.22
was it seems like there there was weird

1141.279 --> 1152.019
things happening it was a if he don't be

1144.22 --> 1159.1000000000001
found on the P mouth uses people spoke

1152.019 --> 1161.59
out before I started doing it well he

1159.1 --> 1164.649
spoke at P Mars spoke out right before

1161.59 --> 1168.22
that that's very thing started poor

1164.649 --> 1170.1999999999998
embalming so either somebody played his

1168.22 --> 1172.059
voice and then started the foreign bomb

1170.2 --> 1175.539
but it's much more likely it was

1172.059 --> 1178.57
actually him and he was actually in chat

1175.539 --> 1182.19
the real him so yeah it's the FE don't

1178.57 --> 1187.299
be a council isn't is that his account

1182.19 --> 1189.7
mmm is that evil yeah most females is

1187.299 --> 1192.49
that account is Feliz right okay well

1189.7 --> 1195.49
he's a beast banned forever he's not

1192.49 --> 1196.21
water coming on my life strange ever

1195.49 --> 1198.309
again

1196.21 --> 1200.049
lock him in your chat so that you never

1198.309 --> 1202.059
see is calm his comments and then he

1200.049 --> 1204.25
just goes away now I don't need to block

1202.059 --> 1206.2
him look in chat he's harmless enough

1204.25 --> 1209.559
and if I'm gonna block him he's just

1206.2 --> 1211.179
gonna haunt me with more sock trolls so

1209.559 --> 1213.9089999999999
that's not the way I want to block him

1211.179 --> 1216.16
I'm just banning him from being part of

1213.909 --> 1220.0
the show except for chat for hour

1216.16 --> 1222.0
that's what the during punishment let's

1220.0 --> 1226.63
change topic so we don't glorify anymore

1222.0 --> 1228.07
all right so so should we talk about the

1226.63 --> 1235.0600000000002
gas pressure video and all that [ __ ]

1228.07 --> 1237.01
didn't get a very good title right sorry

1235.06 --> 1242.85
I'm still working on trying to get rule

1237.01 --> 1248.35
if I'm not getting you a message like

1242.85 --> 1250.3
you say oh I miss no it's not there we

1248.35 --> 1254.08
must have walked no I don't have him

1250.3 --> 1258.7
blocked I'm not getting his message want

1254.08 --> 1264.3999999999999
me to sell the Skype you mean do you

1258.7 --> 1266.92
know mr. Collins okay somebody added me

1264.4 --> 1268.9
maybe I did have him block a wait could

1266.92 --> 1270.88
be actually because probably the last

1268.9 --> 1274.39
time in chat he was acting like a total

1270.88 --> 1278.3200000000002
dick so maybe I did have the rule

1274.39 --> 1281.74
original rule have blocked let's see is

1278.32 --> 1286.0
there a blocked list want me to send

1281.74 --> 1289.06
them the link yeah you can send him a

1286.0 --> 1290.77
link if you know exactly who it is I do

1289.06 --> 1296.83
know who it is I haven't blocked as well

1290.77 --> 1302.53
cuz he's a dick right okay anyway send

1296.83 --> 1308.4099999999999
him the link if you want okay yes the

1302.53 --> 1309.8799999999999
link all right my last mess was do not

1308.41 --> 1311.47
take this the wrong way Glen but I

1309.88 --> 1313.2700000000002
consider you to be a dishonest sack of

1311.47 --> 1314.14
[ __ ] leave me alone and then he said

1313.27 --> 1315.8799999999999
back ok champ

1314.14 --> 1320.8200000000002
if ever you want to learn to triangle

1315.88 --> 1325.5100000000002
let me know I just saw it ok alright Oh

1320.82 --> 1330.55
before hello but before you start out

1325.51 --> 1333.67
Thank You Rene Colusa for the $5 super

1330.55 --> 1335.98
chat donation happy flatter day let's

1333.67 --> 1339.04
unite and perform math globe or shion's

1335.98 --> 1343.69
by teaching flat earth everywhere school

1339.04 --> 1346.19
skin kindergarten universities the end

1343.69 --> 1349.13
of the ball all right

1346.19 --> 1350.54
I really don't like the word globe or

1349.13 --> 1354.3100000000002
shin spider I think it's really

1350.54 --> 1358.3
disgusting but I get it I get it

1354.31 --> 1360.2
thank you for the super chat donations

1358.3 --> 1367.93
hey

1360.2 --> 1367.93
Hagrid well soon

1368.95 --> 1376.67
bit messy afternoon yeah it was a bit of

1373.52 --> 1378.47
a rough start I think Oh actually I was

1376.67 --> 1382.88
going for an hour it was really good

1378.47 --> 1390.14
show and then a last moment it redid

1382.88 --> 1395.3600000000001
last minute okay yeah it was pretty much

1390.14 --> 1396.1100000000001
on the hour mark yeah you know what I

1395.36 --> 1404.06
don't get

1396.11 --> 1407.1399999999999
hmm if we we you and me for example and

1404.06 --> 1411.85
a couple of others in the chat

1407.14 --> 1417.17
recognises the earth is flat and other

1411.85 --> 1420.59
agencies lie as well and we bring it to

1417.17 --> 1427.66
someone that doesn't know yet I don't

1420.59 --> 1431.11
get that those people can't see that

1427.66 --> 1435.77
we're being serious about this you know

1431.11 --> 1440.4199999999998
we we really are awake from something

1435.77 --> 1443.3899999999999
and yeah well I get it but they don't

1440.42 --> 1446.51
see it that way though what they say is

1443.39 --> 1448.19
that if we take this serious then there

1446.51 --> 1452.24
must be something really wrong because

1448.19 --> 1456.71
they can't a tomb to the form of reason

1452.24 --> 1459.23
that we see in this state it's literally

1456.71 --> 1462.14
aw it looks off it looks like poisoned

1459.23 --> 1464.96
to them intuitively as they believe in

1462.14 --> 1467.0300000000002
the globe as they trust that that's how

1464.96 --> 1470.3500000000001
it's perceived it's how I perceived it

1467.03 --> 1471.74
when I was still living in the globe

1470.35 --> 1475.81
good evening

1471.74 --> 1475.81
hadar hello my evening

1477.37 --> 1488.6299999999999
so I do get it but it's very frustrating

1484.54 --> 1491.62
it is I mean if you look at the score

1488.63 --> 1497.5
today eleven against six - come on man

1491.62 --> 1501.9799999999998
Oh you had the down vote you mean mmm

1497.5 --> 1504.53
it's weird and this is going again

1501.98 --> 1507.98
they're they're still on to me - 60 -

1504.53 --> 1512.6299999999999
it's just I'm gonna make mine because

1507.98 --> 1519.05
you gave me the link back to 60 - all

1512.63 --> 1521.8700000000001
right I think I think there's more

1519.05 --> 1523.73
people voting downloading my video than

1521.87 --> 1527.84
there are actual people watching my

1523.73 --> 1529.91
video yeah down vote books oh and don't

1527.84 --> 1532.79
worry about it I know I know but I'm

1529.91 --> 1537.5900000000001
still kind of fascinating that that this

1532.79 --> 1540.17
happens every day every day the entire

1537.59 --> 1541.85
early bird show never mentioned it is

1540.17 --> 1545.18
the fact that you mention it that Mason

1541.85 --> 1548.09
inspires them to do it so if I know but

1545.18 --> 1553.55
yeah but I do get no votes though it's

1548.09 --> 1556.4299999999998
from it and a vote is still a vote it's

1553.55 --> 1560.02
still gonna be a critical mass of

1556.43 --> 1562.79
attention whether that be bad or good so

1560.02 --> 1565.99
hey rube if the PC that's behind you is

1562.79 --> 1568.7
that you mrs. the specie no I've got

1565.99 --> 1570.68
like a dual set up this is like my

1568.7 --> 1573.64
development PC and when I get my

1570.68 --> 1578.15
training set up working on to use though

1573.64 --> 1581.15
I'm gonna microwave machine you're

1578.15 --> 1583.7900000000002
trading what you mean trading I will

1581.15 --> 1588.7
trade derivatives on the Korean stock

1583.79 --> 1593.09
exchange interesting that's pretty cool

1588.7 --> 1596.57
why the Korean because it's nuts

1593.09 --> 1598.1299999999999
pretty much that make it like highly

1596.57 --> 1599.72
profitable because it's unpredictable or

1598.13 --> 1600.5600000000002
does it mean that it's an unknown market

1599.72 --> 1602.6000000000001
and you're doing it for shits and

1600.56 --> 1606.23
giggles no I used to trade career a lot

1602.6 --> 1609.6599999999999
back when I was at work it's really

1606.23 --> 1611.43
tight really tight markets

1609.66 --> 1614.97
and just crazy [ __ ] goes the answer

1611.43 --> 1618.1100000000001
should be the best for the strategy that

1614.97 --> 1634.29
I'm planning to do do you think crypto

1618.11 --> 1637.86
no negative no ways oh can you have a

1634.29 --> 1639.3899999999999
gas pressure with our container yeah I

1637.86 --> 1641.9099999999999
don't understand the need for a

1639.39 --> 1644.94
container when you have gravity it

1641.91 --> 1648.63
creates the pressure yeah

1644.94 --> 1650.88
particles particles accelerating towards

1648.63 --> 1655.44
the ground creates pressure and what

1650.88 --> 1659.18
about the Evo okay particles of helium

1655.44 --> 1659.18
will also accelerate towards the ground

1660.77 --> 1667.59
towards the ground creates pressure how

1663.6 --> 1669.54
I don't think so if you have a better

1667.59 --> 1672.4199999999998
best place you put some helium in there

1669.54 --> 1673.6499999999999
you put a single particle if you only a

1672.42 --> 1676.29
minute get in a vacuum chamber where

1673.65 --> 1677.76
it's gonna go a single particle of

1676.29 --> 1681.24
helium that oh really you're gonna

1677.76 --> 1684.33
isolate a single you tell me tell me

1681.24 --> 1688.23
what is single particle of alien just a

1684.33 --> 1689.76
place where it was it wouldn't be real

1688.23 --> 1691.17
if you tell me what the answer is I know

1689.76 --> 1693.6299999999999
the answer will you tell me what it is

1691.17 --> 1696.3300000000002
it's gonna go to the bottom well say

1693.63 --> 1698.25
zero or one there you go all right so

1696.33 --> 1703.4399999999998
it's like so go to the bottom

1698.25 --> 1709.32
move it if it has no choice prefer down

1703.44 --> 1712.0800000000002
from up because there is a force acting

1709.32 --> 1713.55
on it is it not because the mass of the

1712.08 --> 1714.75
helium is greater than the vacuum it

1713.55 --> 1717.51
sits in yeah

1714.75 --> 1722.39
the vacuum doesn't have a mess exactly

1717.51 --> 1725.58
that's why I understand this whole day

1722.39 --> 1728.66
because as a molecule has more density

1725.58 --> 1733.26
than no molecule at all

1728.66 --> 1736.65
well anything but the molecule weighs

1733.26 --> 1740.52
something so he's gonna fall though it's

1736.65 --> 1743.19
got lace to enrich point because of the

1740.52 --> 1745.48
relative density equilibrium

1743.19 --> 1748.299
not that it's not a direction with if

1745.48 --> 1750.64
it's a vector in fact their direction

1748.299 --> 1753.4
it's not really relevant because they're

1750.64 --> 1756.13
really discussing is presupposing that

1753.4 --> 1757.8090000000002
it's a force doing that or describing it

1756.13 --> 1761.7700000000002
through these scientifically proven

1757.809 --> 1763.84
functions of relative density so whether

1761.77 --> 1768.46
the direction is not actually even

1763.84 --> 1770.559
relative it's only relative for the for

1768.46 --> 1773.1100000000001
the scientific proof of relative density

1770.559 --> 1776.7
theory that is all there's no real

1773.11 --> 1780.52
objection to pointing at directions in

1776.7 --> 1781.929
general description and you're both

1780.52 --> 1786.429
talking each other over each other it's

1781.929 --> 1792.1000000000001
difficult area nod let's call it a

1786.429 --> 1794.02
vector though the answer your question

1792.1 --> 1796.1789999999999
is why does it go down because the

1794.02 --> 1798.04
medium it sits in is a value of zero and

1796.179 --> 1800.47
the helium atom has a value of greater

1798.04 --> 1803.44
than zero so it displaces that which

1800.47 --> 1805.03
cannot hold its weight but where are you

1803.44 --> 1808.39
getting a direction from if it's just

1805.03 --> 1811.36
density there's no element the value of

1808.39 --> 1815.5590000000002
zero that gives it its vector I got a

1811.36 --> 1818.559
question do you what's known look that

1815.559 --> 1818.95
the relative density spectrum is what it

1818.559 --> 1823.51
is

1818.95 --> 1826.03
the way it is as established it just is

1823.51 --> 1829.0
there's no scientific explanation as to

1826.03 --> 1830.559
why you could of course presuppose that

1829.0 --> 1832.72
it's all caused by some kind of

1830.559 --> 1834.6689999999999
mysterious and provable force that is

1832.72 --> 1836.74
causing the gradient that's really nice

1834.669 --> 1838.45
but you can't prove that but what we

1836.74 --> 1841.51
can't prove is that there is the

1838.45 --> 1843.299
gradient and how it functions I quite

1841.51 --> 1846.49
honestly don't care if we can prove

1843.299 --> 1850.0
gravity we all have to accept there is

1846.49 --> 1853.6
an acceleration towards the ground we

1850.0 --> 1855.429
have to know it's there's an apparent we

1853.6 --> 1856.6599999999999
did not I do deny that objects

1855.429 --> 1864.49
accelerate towards the ground in a

1856.66 --> 1868.45
vacuum chamber no we accept that good

1864.49 --> 1870.82
acceleration exists is very nice it is

1868.45 --> 1871.75
causing the acceleration that's okay

1870.82 --> 1873.6399999999999
what causes it Anthony

1871.75 --> 1874.26
I don't care if it's the whole snapping

1873.64 --> 1877.6200000000001
the [ __ ] wall

1874.26 --> 1879.96
into or whatever you need gravity to

1877.62 --> 1882.09
explain to at least half explain the

1879.96 --> 1883.8600000000001
requirements that is necessary to hold

1882.09 --> 1887.1
the pressure of the explosion of Earth's

1883.86 --> 1890.4299999999998
pressure its gas pressure off into space

1887.1 --> 1891.84
that's the opposite force right do you

1890.43 --> 1895.53
disagree that there's a force going

1891.84 --> 1898.05
towards the ground yes okay yeah it's

1895.53 --> 1900.99
just a nice agree do you disagree that

1898.05 --> 1908.1599999999999
something accelerates mass towards the

1900.99 --> 1910.02
ground yes yes no butts no things

1908.16 --> 1912.9
accelerate towards the ground but you're

1910.02 --> 1915.03
saying it's something there's not

1912.9 --> 1918.15
something we're generating it it is

1915.03 --> 1920.28
accelerating its mass its displacement

1918.15 --> 1922.95
Matt I'm gonna call it a force it's

1920.28 --> 1925.17
relative density inherence displacement

1922.95 --> 1927.54
that's what R is happening you know the

1925.17 --> 1929.52
boat sinks a boat normally floats right

1927.54 --> 1932.8799999999999
but when that boat sinks what what

1929.52 --> 1937.11
changes that makes that boat sink water

1932.88 --> 1939.3600000000001
the buoyant force is correct once once

1937.11 --> 1941.04
the boat takes water on and it changes

1939.36 --> 1946.08
its weight relative to the medium it's

1941.04 --> 1947.6399999999999
in it goes down correct but gravity that

1946.08 --> 1949.4099999999999
pulls the boat down was it removed it

1947.64 --> 1952.0200000000002
was the change in the boats position its

1949.41 --> 1954.69
density relative water it's in boats the

1952.02 --> 1956.79
boat feels an acceleration towards the

1954.69 --> 1958.74
ground well what caused it though I

1956.79 --> 1963.27
don't care I don't care what you want to

1958.74 --> 1965.28
call it I'll be okay if you don't care

1963.27 --> 1967.35
then you won't mind if we just call it

1965.28 --> 1969.84
relative density that's the cause as

1967.35 --> 1975.78
proven before and it'll be like right

1969.84 --> 1978.6899999999998
okay it's relative density causes

1975.78 --> 1982.56
acceleration towards the ground or any

1978.69 --> 1985.65
direction as long as a a piece of matter

1982.56 --> 1988.35
whatever it make be consistent of it

1985.65 --> 1991.26
will rush towards its equilibrium point

1988.35 --> 1993.05
in the spectrum of all things and that

1991.26 --> 1995.46
causes acceleration that's right

1993.05 --> 1998.1599999999999
absolutely okay so we're all in

1995.46 --> 2000.1100000000001
agreement that objects in a vacuum will

1998.16 --> 2003.44
accelerate towards the ground yep

2000.11 --> 2005.36
objects will accelerate towards the

2003.44 --> 2008.029
ground only if the objects mass is

2005.36 --> 2011.269
greater than the vacuum it sits in well

2008.029 --> 2013.399
he divided through vacuum chamber so in

2011.269 --> 2016.609
a vacuum yes things everything will

2013.399 --> 2019.4889999999998
accelerate towards the ground yes party

2016.609 --> 2023.1789999999999
if it is firing enough if hang on hang

2019.489 --> 2025.82
on so unless the move unless the mass of

2023.179 --> 2028.249
the particle is equal to the vacuum in

2025.82 --> 2030.759
which it's in and guess what we do have

2028.249 --> 2034.34
we have massless particles apparently

2030.759 --> 2036.59
notif mate as a massless particle you

2034.34 --> 2038.869
get a photon of light and then fire it

2036.59 --> 2042.619
across the vacuum I don't know whether

2038.869 --> 2045.1689999999999
you describe photons as particles or the

2042.619 --> 2047.809
much less particle nowadays it's said to

2045.169 --> 2051.549
be a particle Riley but it's not I know

2047.809 --> 2051.549
but this is their science though right

2051.7 --> 2057.379
it's my nameís it's claimed that light

2055.099 --> 2059.75
has mass and his feed

2057.379 --> 2063.2599999999998
no it's claimed that microwatt there's

2059.75 --> 2066.079
not a mess though if the rain doesn't

2063.26 --> 2070.159
name article it should fall to the floor

2066.079 --> 2072.44
or should it float really I miss the

2070.159 --> 2075.289
first pot going wait if like ants

2072.44 --> 2077.48
electrons have mass right yeah electrons

2075.289 --> 2079.0690000000004
are no light light supposedly does not

2077.48 --> 2082.609
have mass or is it just super

2079.069 --> 2086.179
insignificant light is massless okay off

2082.609 --> 2087.74
no she comes out mass yeah nothing can

2086.179 --> 2092.389
travel at the speed of light that has

2087.74 --> 2096.859
mess hmm okay all right so let me

2092.389 --> 2099.289
question move if yes if light is a

2096.859 --> 2101.029
particle but it's a massless particle

2099.289 --> 2103.46
and he stick a photon of light in a

2101.029 --> 2107.39
vacuum chamber what's the bug what's it

2103.46 --> 2108.7400000000002
gonna do if it has no mass so if photons

2107.39 --> 2110.45
of light what they do in a vacuum

2108.74 --> 2112.0099999999998
chamber they have no mass so they will

2110.45 --> 2116.299
not be subjected to it a relative

2112.01 --> 2118.9700000000003
density I'll just be absorbed relativity

2116.299 --> 2121.7599999999998
but I am told that light can be affected

2118.97 --> 2124.1899999999996
by gravity I couldn't describe it yeah

2121.76 --> 2125.51
so be if we could demonstrate a light

2124.19 --> 2127.76
for a photon of light in a vacuum

2125.51 --> 2129.7990000000004
chamber it wouldn't go down because it

2127.76 --> 2132.23
has no mass so relative to the the

2129.799 --> 2134.27
medium it's in the vacuum it has no mass

2132.23 --> 2137.92
so it should maintain its position or

2134.27 --> 2141.72
just float around wondrously like a gas

2137.92 --> 2143.31
at the speed of light to wherever

2141.72 --> 2144.74
well that's what we need to test really

2143.31 --> 2150.839
because we apparently light is a

2144.74 --> 2152.819
massless particle it's very nice to the

2150.839 --> 2155.49
nares of what a particle means then I

2152.819 --> 2157.44
think well unfortunately light is a

2155.49 --> 2159.8689999999997
particle according to your science it's

2157.44 --> 2162.869
all business conversation sounds like a

2159.869 --> 2170.2200000000003
conversation about orbital mechanics but

2162.869 --> 2172.9500000000003
in the miniature world to me sorry I

2170.22 --> 2175.29
have to go to a birthday so I'm gonna

2172.95 --> 2178.56
leave you all all right I want to go out

2175.29 --> 2179.0099999999998
with the earth is flat research it all

2178.56 --> 2181.14
right

2179.01 --> 2185.19
the Ernie is flat hey thanks for joining

2181.14 --> 2186.839
a grid wells see anybody you know I hope

2185.19 --> 2189.18
you're saying that all equals of mass

2186.839 --> 2191.73
can't travel at the speed of light says

2189.18 --> 2194.72
that because the mass of the object will

2191.73 --> 2200.22
become infinite

2194.72 --> 2202.64
so basically no mass can have the energy

2200.22 --> 2207.99
to accelerate them to the speed of light

2202.64 --> 2209.9
but that new that doesn't sound right to

2207.99 --> 2213.359
me because if you had an object in space

2209.9 --> 2215.64
and it was traveling through three space

2213.359 --> 2218.22
and you had a constant acceleration even

2215.64 --> 2220.2
if it was mine you eventually it would

2218.22 --> 2222.72
start traveling the speed of light if

2220.2 --> 2225.45
you had enough energy to give it a

2222.72 --> 2226.9199999999996
consistent force yeah but I think the

2225.45 --> 2229.8289999999997
theory is that you would require

2226.92 --> 2233.4
infinite energy to do that I'm not an

2229.829 --> 2236.0890000000004
activity by a long Travie is until I

2233.4 --> 2239.849
knew it there's a new engine than NASA's

2236.089 --> 2241.92
the sport of this Academy what it's

2239.849 --> 2244.23
called hey but it's a propulsion system

2241.92 --> 2248.51
that requires it has no fuel or anything

2244.23 --> 2252.96
but it has my new amount of force to it

2248.51 --> 2257.5200000000004
follow those nail the big sail yeah no

2252.96 --> 2259.52
so it's a different one but this thing

2257.52 --> 2263.49
even though it's such a small force

2259.52 --> 2265.77
because it's continuous over a amount of

2263.49 --> 2269.8489999999997
time it can probably reach the speed of

2265.77 --> 2272.369
light but it would take a while

2269.849 --> 2273.54
I would I would ask a physicist and I

2272.369 --> 2275.7000000000003
would say that it's theoretically

2273.54 --> 2277.89
impossible and I would say

2275.7 --> 2284.3289999999997
theoretically irrelevant unless we can

2277.89 --> 2284.3289999999997
demonstrate our so yeah I do also Oh

2287.96 --> 2301.4700000000003
physicists like JM truth or GM Cove it's

2296.609 --> 2306.45
also really Oh hold on that's dark [ __ ]

2301.47 --> 2312.06
I miss the universe question you are

2306.45 --> 2314.73
sitting that's 25 Coleman yeah yeah yeah

2312.06 --> 2317.19
yeah good to see a fellow Aussie on here

2314.73 --> 2320.7
yeah

2317.19 --> 2323.94
Aussie Aussie Aussie and Jessica no

2320.7 --> 2326.46
that's Chrissy you can come back by like

2323.94 --> 2329.16
at 3 o'clock out there no easy easy New

2326.46 --> 2333.57
Zealand or Australia yeah we can tell

2329.16 --> 2334.56
the accents apart is your Kiwi I don't

2333.57 --> 2341.6400000000003
know how you can tell the difference

2334.56 --> 2345.69
towards the old Sal my Ozzy's a memory

2341.64 --> 2347.73
in Monday May we're not Kiwis brew we

2345.69 --> 2349.5
have a city within a city you've got

2347.73 --> 2361.94
Salford which is a city in its own right

2349.5 --> 2371.76
and you are muncher let's talk about the

2361.94 --> 2376.819
lighthouses from one water ok ok yeah so

2371.76 --> 2381.21
what are you on Scott yes that's me yeah

2376.819 --> 2383.88
you're which which one were you Glen dot

2381.21 --> 2387.06
Williamson haha cool man

2383.88 --> 2389.7200000000003
no worries that's pretty funny other day

2387.06 --> 2392.849
like it was um I think was Dane guys

2389.72 --> 2394.7999999999997
like I posted a video of mine and dingo

2392.849 --> 2396.63
saw that roof guys he's he's pretty

2394.8 --> 2399.9300000000003
smart he's come back from cancer as well

2396.63 --> 2402.54
and then and then I like posts my latest

2399.93 --> 2404.069
blood test [ __ ] in the in the

2402.54 --> 2406.2799999999997
Chattanooga Zod did you have cancer his

2404.069 --> 2406.2799999999997
work

2407.16 --> 2415.06
yeah yeah we're gonna write back but

2413.11 --> 2420.69
this could just be doing well there

2415.06 --> 2422.68
yeah I'm fine transpose rented years ago

2420.69 --> 2425.34
she was a big girl

2422.68 --> 2429.3999999999996
did you try alternative therapies relief

2425.34 --> 2431.1600000000003
no you just relied on the traditional

2429.4 --> 2434.59
chemotherapy and stuff

2431.16 --> 2443.6499999999996
yeah chemo and pretty hardcore

2434.59 --> 2445.63
antibiotics Yonex for cancer well had an

2443.65 --> 2447.52
infection right I I presented to

2445.63 --> 2451.9900000000002
hospital with a massive infection that

2447.52 --> 2454.45
would not get better and then like 24

2451.99 --> 2457.99
hours later him in ICU pretty close to

2454.45 --> 2460.8999999999996
dying so I was pretty close to dying and

2457.99 --> 2464.2299999999996
going through chemo at the same time it

2460.9 --> 2467.59
was freaking hectic what was the call

2464.23 --> 2469.93
infection someone to do the cancer oh no

2467.59 --> 2471.31
no just my head we came here I'd said

2469.93 --> 2473.1699999999996
knocks out your immune system so I

2471.31 --> 2475.86
couldn't I had this infection for like

2473.17 --> 2481.11
two weeks wouldn't go away so I had

2475.86 --> 2483.82
really ulcerated back of my throat had a

2481.11 --> 2486.6600000000003
like an abscess behind my front teeth

2483.82 --> 2489.1600000000003
had like a jaw ache so whatever it was

2486.66 --> 2491.98
wouldn't go away and I just I was like

2489.16 --> 2493.77
oh [ __ ] like I'll go to hospital get a

2491.98 --> 2496.36
lot of antibiotics and then I'll go home

2493.77 --> 2498.73
and it just didn't that didn't happen no

2496.36 --> 2501.52
worse an antibiotic doesn't help with

2498.73 --> 2507.43
that at all it's not a bacterial

2501.52 --> 2510.67
infection no it actually was cancer was

2507.43 --> 2512.0499999999997
a bacterial infection no no I can to not

2510.67 --> 2514.29
get my immune system that's why I

2512.05 --> 2517.54
couldn't fight the infection

2514.29 --> 2518.74
you mean the chemotherapy knocked out

2517.54 --> 2521.71
your immune system

2518.74 --> 2523.2099999999996
no no cancer I couldn't find an

2521.71 --> 2525.85
infection because all my white blood

2523.21 --> 2528.34
cells were shite so they had to knock

2525.85 --> 2530.65
out so fear because they were shy I

2528.34 --> 2533.11
couldn't find infection so they had to

2530.65 --> 2534.76
knock out and let it regenerate over the

2533.11 --> 2537.13
course of about two weeks so that it

2534.76 --> 2539.05
could fight the fit had the infection

2537.13 --> 2542.05
and the meantime I had Android

2539.05 --> 2544.8100000000004
and any boils and any fungals so when

2542.05 --> 2551.11
did you get the chemotherapy before or

2544.81 --> 2556.93
after they they - they - they - okay so

2551.11 --> 2559.06
Rama it would say it's pretty life my

2556.93 --> 2562.48
opinion combining all those things this

2559.06 --> 2564.64
is terrible chemotherapy severely

2562.48 --> 2568.81
attacks the immune system it's known to

2564.64 --> 2571.66
do that and degrade your age oh and I

2568.81 --> 2574.2999999999997
wouldn't actually immune system at well

2571.66 --> 2577.48
it did great your your flora and your

2574.3 --> 2580.4500000000003
intestine severely so the combination is

2577.48 --> 2583.09
very dangerous in my opinion but hey it

2580.45 --> 2585.6
was apparently a pretty acute situation

2583.09 --> 2589.84
and I would be dead with that came up

2585.6 --> 2591.7
100% well I have been raised within our

2589.84 --> 2594.4900000000002
stem cells you would have had so go on

2591.7 --> 2596.5299999999997
overseas for the treatment yeah no no no

2594.49 --> 2598.0299999999997
stem cell transplant is just when they

2596.53 --> 2600.1600000000003
let my brother

2598.03 --> 2601.6600000000003
all the bone marrow it's after we run

2600.16 --> 2603.0699999999997
that's afterwards

2601.66 --> 2606.39
yeah after it's me you know it's good

2603.07 --> 2611.8
nose January those who yet January 2017

2606.39 --> 2616.24
yes yeah because I know that I used to

2611.8 --> 2619.3
work it on the spinal Ward and under the

2616.24 --> 2621.1299999999997
guys there because in Australia is stem

2619.3 --> 2622.63
cell treatment is a little bit

2621.13 --> 2625.12
controversial and they all have to fly

2622.63 --> 2627.4900000000002
overseas to get stem-cell treatment so

2625.12 --> 2630.0099999999998
but here figuring out people stem cells

2627.49 --> 2632.4399999999996
here yeah this is my brother and my

2630.01 --> 2634.63
brother had injections to produce a

2632.44 --> 2636.79
whole bunch of blood stem cells and then

2634.63 --> 2639.4900000000002
he was just on a like a dialysis machine

2636.79 --> 2643.02
Friday I was harvesting them right and

2639.49 --> 2646.3599999999997
then he give it a year to match yeah

2643.02 --> 2648.67
well yeah that was a that was a big day

2646.36 --> 2650.71
finding out that he was a match as a pea

2648.67 --> 2654.55
yeah man yeah that's pretty lucky so

2650.71 --> 2656.62
you're leaning on a two so then you're

2654.55 --> 2658.8700000000003
pretty lucky I didn't find out he was a

2656.62 --> 2661.68
match until like my third round of chemo

2658.87 --> 2663.25
like a second third second right Athena

2661.68 --> 2665.68
that's still pretty good

2663.25 --> 2668.73
oh yeah yeah so I've got two brothers

2665.68 --> 2671.1299999999997
and each one is meant to be a 25% chance

2668.73 --> 2672.73
so combined it works out like

2671.13 --> 2674.29
40-something four

2672.73 --> 2677.92
4% of something that one of them is a

2674.29 --> 2678.34
match at least one okay Coomer that's

2677.92 --> 2680.02
good

2678.34 --> 2684.48
oh I've enjoyed the conversations we've

2680.02 --> 2684.48
been having Susy survived sorry Olga

2685.68 --> 2692.3199999999997
okay all right butter what can we talk

2688.39 --> 2697.42
about all the law houses yeah try to

2692.32 --> 2698.8900000000003
find that picture I sent in the chat and

2697.42 --> 2703.27
I just asked you something quickly roof

2698.89 --> 2706.21
yep that's Ted see if you have one

2703.27 --> 2710.38
saying we you on the key mode tablets or

2706.21 --> 2713.92
on the know I had full dress

2710.38 --> 2718.4500000000003
yeah the gifts okay yeah that's rough

2713.92 --> 2720.55
dude yeah it is it depends what year did

2718.45 --> 2725.95
you get it because there's been a lot of

2720.55 --> 2729.7000000000003
changes in the types of oh it used to be

2725.95 --> 2732.49
terrible it's not an example now but oh

2729.7 --> 2735.1299999999997
they give you a lot of any any nausea I

2732.49 --> 2738.7299999999996
was a cold pocket the name of the actual

2735.13 --> 2742.0
drug but the translation but was much

2738.73 --> 2745.66
more yeah yeah max alone on dance-a-tron

2742.0 --> 2746.8
it's pretty good right I forget the name

2745.66 --> 2749.8599999999997
of the cane I'll have to look at all

2746.8 --> 2752.11
that well personally I would look in

2749.86 --> 2755.05
your case it was pretty extreme probably

2752.11 --> 2757.3
leukemia just kind of complex and so I

2755.05 --> 2759.61
can't even say don't do anything about

2757.3 --> 2762.25
it because leukemia is a little bit more

2759.61 --> 2764.38
complex to me but what I in generally

2762.25 --> 2768.19
would recommend instead of anything

2764.38 --> 2770.17
especially chemotherapy is just eat

2768.19 --> 2773.68
healthy get all the poisons out of your

2770.17 --> 2775.57
diet minimize stress potentially go on

2773.68 --> 2778.2999999999997
Gerson Therapy for which you will need

2775.57 --> 2781.4700000000003
to be raw a raw vegan for at least a

2778.3 --> 2788.8
while look at it - Gerson Therapy and

2781.47 --> 2790.5099999999998
cannabis oil big dosages and we have

2788.8 --> 2793.1800000000003
receptors on our body that are

2790.51 --> 2796.4500000000003
specifically designated for cannon

2793.18 --> 2801.1299999999997
cannabinoids to eradicate cancer of all

2796.45 --> 2803.3199999999997
kinds and generally hurt our system to

2801.13 --> 2806.02
restore so that's my general advice

2803.32 --> 2809.17
about it that's what I would choose

2806.02 --> 2812.0099999999998
first to do but that's just me I was on

2809.17 --> 2815.28
site Arab green for the induction round

2812.01 --> 2819.0
and then for the transplant it was

2815.28 --> 2820.84
cyclophosphamide and was the other one

2819.0 --> 2825.13
whatever the other one was that is like

2820.84 --> 2827.23
an induction as a sorry a there's seven

2825.13 --> 2829.83
days prior to the actual transplant

2827.23 --> 2833.7400000000002
where they wipe out your bone marrow

2829.83 --> 2837.16
abuse often I was on Beus often for five

2833.74 --> 2842.08
days and had a steak on day five and I

2837.16 --> 2849.5499999999997
was cheering so good I was like you know

2842.08 --> 2851.65
throw it up no I there's also a drug

2849.55 --> 2855.76
after the transplant coordinate the trek

2851.65 --> 2860.13
site and that it's like a really mini

2855.76 --> 2865.1800000000003
sort of chemo but it caused my throat to

2860.13 --> 2870.88
disintegrate so I'm constantly gagging

2865.18 --> 2878.3799999999997
on my disintegrating throat that was a

2870.88 --> 2881.31
late fall that was pretty bad oh yeah

2878.38 --> 2884.5
hectic experience right

2881.31 --> 2886.48
but yeah the transplant went really well

2884.5 --> 2889.98
in terms of the medical side of things

2886.48 --> 2895.36
but it is a horrible horrible experience

2889.98 --> 2898.15
yeah yeah when I was just how does it

2895.36 --> 2900.25
work when they transplanted back did it

2898.15 --> 2902.56
just roughly inject it into your bones

2900.25 --> 2905.05
or something or do you get a drip like

2902.56 --> 2906.7
is this the drip of in your blood blood

2905.05 --> 2908.3500000000004
yeah if I put it back in your

2906.7 --> 2910.81
bloodstream and then it goes into your

2908.35 --> 2912.79
bones and stuff so using my brother's

2910.81 --> 2915.04
blood cells how is that specifically a

2912.79 --> 2916.36
horrible experience I get the chemo like

2915.04 --> 2919.36
getting poisoned there's a horrible

2916.36 --> 2921.34
experience especially the nausea but the

2919.36 --> 2924.55
getting it back in your body was that

2921.34 --> 2926.11
terrible sensation as well no that's

2924.55 --> 2927.94
just a drip like that's nothing that was

2926.11 --> 2933.4900000000002
literally a huge any climax that was

2927.94 --> 2936.96
nothing thankful part would have been to

2933.49 --> 2943.56
be brother actually getting the yeah

2936.96 --> 2946.7200000000003
no no he didn't have he they didn't have

2943.56 --> 2948.0099999999998
bone marrow what biopsies it's just a

2946.72 --> 2950.98
blog thing right

2948.01 --> 2954.0400000000004
oh it said not yet my marrow biopsies

2950.98 --> 2960.4900000000002
are the worst experience that's been the

2954.04 --> 2962.5
worst yeah pretty painful man I remember

2960.49 --> 2965.5299999999997
my wife is sitting in front of me and

2962.5 --> 2968.32
I'm screaming at her when this chick is

2965.53 --> 2971.38
trying to drill those rotary drills into

2968.32 --> 2975.78
my hip ha ha ha he was I you know I've

2971.38 --> 2975.78
ever experienced uh-huh

2976.3 --> 2985.9
I couldn't they did just sedate you I

2980.369 --> 2987.67
had some benzos but it was four yeah

2985.9 --> 2992.32
it's probably the leader resonating off

2987.67 --> 2994.3
the bones just it felt you feel it

2992.32 --> 2996.07
resonating throughout your skeleton

2994.3 --> 3000.4500000000003
probably that's probably a terrible

2996.07 --> 3007.5
sensation right it feels like someone is

3000.45 --> 3009.96
drilling into your bones that's it yeah

3007.5 --> 3017.85
the most pain I've ever experienced in

3009.96 --> 3019.92
my life okay that's not saying something

3017.85 --> 3025.92
or earlier and I kind of wanted to hear

3019.92 --> 3028.29
what he had to say will be once you have

3025.92 --> 3029.52
that transplant know it you know the way

3028.29 --> 3031.65
to know whether or not he's been

3029.52 --> 3033.9
successful that would have been the

3031.65 --> 3036.0
hardest pile at a thought yeah there's a

3033.9 --> 3037.83
like a 10% mortality rate with the

3036.0 --> 3039.98
actual transplant while your hospital

3037.83 --> 3044.369
that was pretty rough trying to sort of

3039.98 --> 3046.89
get through that knowing that I had an

3044.369 --> 3049.44
infection might be there's a marker in

3046.89 --> 3051.8689999999997
your blood that's like a proxy for how

3049.44 --> 3053.55
much infections in your body and mine

3051.869 --> 3056.609
got fairly elevated during the

3053.55 --> 3058.5
transplant and I don't know why but the

3056.609 --> 3061.91
doctors were going let's just wait and

3058.5 --> 3063.84
see whether it manifests and hums like I

3061.91 --> 3065.43
like give me some anybody give me

3063.84 --> 3069.8500000000004
something and then I think it was like

3065.43 --> 3071.6499999999996
three days later I got my first sign of

3069.85 --> 3075.31
in response on my first neutrophil count

3071.65 --> 3076.42
came back 0.1 and then the infection

3075.31 --> 3078.67
just went away sir

3076.42 --> 3082.9
and then I went home wow that's good

3078.67 --> 3086.35
relief yeah it's also when I'm gonna

3082.9 --> 3089.14
have my diagnosed with chemo this was

3086.35 --> 3091.65
back in like 97 so chemo treatment back

3089.14 --> 3093.8199999999997
then was like really really harsh and uh

3091.65 --> 3096.58
the side effects that they got were

3093.82 --> 3099.2200000000003
really really damaging my IRA was saying

3096.58 --> 3101.77
the treatment now like what you got is

3099.22 --> 3106.99
so much better compared to what it was

3101.77 --> 3109.78
when I go seek a damaging though like

3106.99 --> 3113.1699999999996
the most obvious damages are just

3109.78 --> 3116.32
general cellular aging you literally

3113.17 --> 3120.25
aged from it or you can some people do

3116.32 --> 3121.96
get older from it and it directed it

3120.25 --> 3129.31
damages your metabolism it's very

3121.96 --> 3131.05
similar to overuse of antibiotics sorry

3129.31 --> 3132.85
you're two of them they have regular

3131.05 --> 3135.4
injections of testosterone is a

3132.85 --> 3137.5
completely wiped out or the old a

3135.4 --> 3141.7000000000003
reproductive stuff pretty much

3137.5 --> 3145.54
everything yeah oh yeah I'm sterile your

3141.7 --> 3147.58
stare out yeah I had the option to

3145.54 --> 3149.92
freeze and sperm and I've said now I've

3147.58 --> 3152.43
got four kids I'm done all right what

3149.92 --> 3155.2000000000003
was good mate they've done their job

3152.43 --> 3160.1499999999996
great yeah

3155.2 --> 3162.16
no I I had cyclophosphamide as part of

3160.15 --> 3165.4
the transplant and apparently it's the

3162.16 --> 3168.21
one that's the the refined mustard gas

3165.4 --> 3171.82
that they use in World War one delicious

3168.21 --> 3180.01
yes it was tops wipe settle your bone

3171.82 --> 3183.7200000000003
marrow delightful abuse offenses often

3180.01 --> 3185.9500000000003
was that apiece on some kissing another

3183.72 --> 3189.0299999999997
the things are they used to using the

3185.95 --> 3192.85
wars are now like prescription drugs yes

3189.03 --> 3199.8100000000004
powerful are in the boat isn't remember

3192.85 --> 3202.5699999999997
it remember aspartame felt use it as a

3199.81 --> 3203.0299999999997
nerve agent and then they figured out it

3202.57 --> 3205.46
kind of

3203.03 --> 3209.9900000000002
had a sweet side taste so they made it

3205.46 --> 3212.45
into a sugar replacement in the 90s it

3209.99 --> 3218.08
was originally designed as a chemical

3212.45 --> 3220.9399999999996
warfare agent was that is a felony

3218.08 --> 3224.59
no it's aspartame all that all the

3220.94 --> 3229.4900000000002
aspartame types but it started without

3224.59 --> 3231.4100000000003
okay all right yeah no [ __ ] ecstasy

3229.49 --> 3232.2799999999997
used to be a prescribed antidepressant

3231.41 --> 3238.0099999999998
during the war as well

3232.28 --> 3242.3300000000004
oh wow you sure I'm a short-term it will

3238.01 --> 3244.7000000000003
probably work oh yeah but two times a

3242.33 --> 3246.35
day yeah yeah it's not gonna work again

3244.7 --> 3250.6099999999997
kind of chronic depression on the

3246.35 --> 3253.85
contrary but right but I guess as

3250.61 --> 3257.33
ecstasy has also been used in PTSD

3253.85 --> 3261.41
treatment right yeah because it kind of

3257.33 --> 3263.93
breaks through it somehow I don't know

3261.41 --> 3268.6099999999997
it move I don't recommend using ecstasy

3263.93 --> 3270.89
but it's interesting what type of drugs

3268.61 --> 3273.98
can be used in very specific situations

3270.89 --> 3277.0699999999997
- they have some kind of effects so that

3273.98 --> 3278.6
can be positive but I remember watching

3277.07 --> 3280.96
a documentary like a British documentary

3278.6 --> 3283.4
where they gave he was twelve people

3280.96 --> 3286.67
ecstasy and there was one guy who

3283.4 --> 3288.2000000000003
absolutely hated it he was basically

3286.67 --> 3291.37
saying like I'd like to be in control of

3288.2 --> 3293.93
my own thoughts I don't like the idea of

3291.37 --> 3296.48
not being in control and I went yeah

3293.93 --> 3304.31
that is me I will never do ecstasy I

3296.48 --> 3309.13
hated cocaine pot nothing so have you

3304.31 --> 3309.13
ever tried methamphetamine or Ritalin

3309.37 --> 3321.35
what was the one no exit no yes or no

3318.43 --> 3324.5299999999997
substance because you probably hate that

3321.35 --> 3327.14
I one of the ones that the pilots use

3324.53 --> 3330.4100000000003
the pilot is on like 24-hour sorting

3327.14 --> 3333.23
missions alright yeah the the stay awake

3330.41 --> 3335.7999999999997
type well the you can get very rough

3333.23 --> 3336.95
with it and you become super compulsive

3335.8 --> 3341.0800000000004
from

3336.95 --> 3343.58
we find it's very annoying you just get

3341.08 --> 3345.5
compulsive by it even though you don't

3343.58 --> 3348.68
have any real feelings about your

3345.5 --> 3351.29
actions you will be compulsive have this

3348.68 --> 3358.97
impulse to do stuff constantly I find it

3351.29 --> 3362.96
extremely annoying so I never knew but

3358.97 --> 3364.43
definitely that's the one yes it wasn't

3362.96 --> 3368.11
wasn't taxi or anything overall ritalin

3364.43 --> 3371.12
but definite oh yeah I'm afternoon well

3368.11 --> 3373.79
yeah you can get ad revenue and then

3371.12 --> 3376.1
that turns into mid-afternoon through

3373.79 --> 3379.46
the breaking down you do yeah a lot of

3376.1 --> 3381.86
are the military and Pilots use it yeah

3379.46 --> 3382.73
it doesn't impair judgment too much but

3381.86 --> 3388.4
keeps you away

3382.73 --> 3393.11
yes yeah because I add cocaine a couple

3388.4 --> 3397.4300000000003
of times and I remember being up like 30

3393.11 --> 3399.44
floors in a hotel before stuff and

3397.43 --> 3403.0699999999997
thinking I just had to get out of the

3399.44 --> 3406.07
hotel I couldn't couldn't stay in the

3403.07 --> 3408.11
hotel right and ended up just walking

3406.07 --> 3411.8300000000004
around up in the city for a couple of

3408.11 --> 3413.33
hours yes I don't know whether that was

3411.83 --> 3414.94
good coke or bad coke but I'm not gonna

3413.33 --> 3417.17
do it again

3414.94 --> 3419.27
because I'm gonna have to go

3417.17 --> 3421.4300000000003
I'm just getting late you know got the

ok no problem thanks for coming over

3446.57 --> 3451.79
don't forget tomorrow it's gonna be

3449.65 --> 3453.65
hopefully an open hangout as well

3451.79 --> 3455.24
although gonna be a little bit more

3453.65 --> 3458.6
careful because of what happened today

3455.24 --> 3461.35
but yeah come back tomorrow again I like

3458.6 --> 3461.35
it was pretty hectic

3462.16 --> 3472.19
sorry I was just saying it's been pretty

3466.369 --> 3475.579
hectic in the chat so yeah yeah yeah I

3472.19 --> 3477.589
kind of did troll bait a lot so maybe in

3475.579 --> 3480.65
that sense I kind of did ask for it a

3477.589 --> 3485.839
little bit but I didn't expect it to go

3480.65 --> 3488.569
that far really like yeah but I didn't

3485.839 --> 3490.729
get a strike it completely slipped by I

3488.569 --> 3495.95
deleted it before it got published so

3490.729 --> 3501.319
I've got lucky and no strike the show

3495.95 --> 3503.209
will go on if you would have got strike

3501.319 --> 3507.43
today I couldn't do a live show anymore

3503.209 --> 3511.719
for like lunch so I'm really lucky

3507.43 --> 3514.759
did it it was Pete Mars

3511.719 --> 3517.219
because I heard his voice just before

3514.759 --> 3519.619
there where I heard his voice he did

3517.219 --> 3523.549
that he was in chat right before that

3519.619 --> 3525.859
and he's doing what he typically tends

3523.549 --> 3527.9
to do when he farm bombs and that is

3525.859 --> 3530.8089999999997
hang around in chat afterwards and joke

3527.9 --> 3535.39
about it and and denying that he was it

3530.809 --> 3535.3900000000003
I'm pretty damn sure it was him

3536.199 --> 3544.309
I've seen worse at least it wasn't gay

3540.019 --> 3546.2589999999996
porn or something let me share what's

3544.309 --> 3548.5690000000004
great no no let's not

3546.259 --> 3552.41
you know moved everything across to the

3548.569 --> 3557.839
other screen all right oh you did there

3552.41 --> 3561.16
we go okay that's the kind of screen you

3557.839 --> 3566.259
can always share no problem with that

3561.16 --> 3570.41
all right so this is from mine whoops

3566.259 --> 3572.959
video that he did the other day so he's

3570.41 --> 3575.779
off he's near the near perth looking

3572.959 --> 3578.5989999999997
across to Rottnest Island and he has

3575.779 --> 3585.89
seen this is watch him up lighthouse and

3578.599 --> 3587.779
this is a wind turbine and my analysis

3585.89 --> 3591.65
of this shows that there's roughly 20

3587.779 --> 3593.809
meters hidden so let's go through how to

3591.65 --> 3595.01
analyze a photo can I ask a question

3593.809 --> 3598.3700000000003
about this when it's

3595.01 --> 3600.6200000000003
photo was made was it rain because it

3598.37 --> 3603.0499999999997
almost looks like draining that kind of

3600.62 --> 3605.27
gray he said it was pretty bad weather

3603.05 --> 3608.69
so right so it could have been raining

3605.27 --> 3611.42
in distance could be yeah

3608.69 --> 3616.46
all right anyway so I took a screenshot

3611.42 --> 3619.25
of it and I know his exact his exact

3616.46 --> 3622.93
observe a location and I know obviously

3619.25 --> 3626.33
the location of the lighthouse and the

3622.93 --> 3629.66
wind turbine so I can get a heading from

3626.33 --> 3631.37
his location to each of them so from his

3629.66 --> 3633.6499999999996
location to the lighthouses

3631.37 --> 3636.29
to 38.9 one degrees and from his

3633.65 --> 3638.96
location to the turbine to thirty nine

3636.29 --> 3641.93
point one two so I know the angular

3638.96 --> 3645.2
distance between the two between the

3641.93 --> 3648.04
lighthouse and the turbine and therefore

3645.2 --> 3651.1699999999996
I know the angular size or the angular

3648.04 --> 3653.24
measurement of the photo both top to

3651.17 --> 3655.46
bottom and left to right okay because

3653.24 --> 3655.91
that is a linear scale at a long

3655.46 --> 3662.69
distance

3655.91 --> 3664.73
does everyone agree with that does

3662.69 --> 3667.07
everyone agree that a photo at a long

3664.73 --> 3672.41
distance is linear in terms of its

3667.07 --> 3674.4500000000003
angles well if he was in a lab yes if

3672.41 --> 3676.97
using a lab yes with no atmosphere book

3674.45 --> 3678.89
when you're on when you when you you

3676.97 --> 3681.5299999999997
look in across water you get all kinds

3678.89 --> 3684.8599999999997
of strange stuff up with it so maybe if

3681.53 --> 3687.17
it's bad weather I would say that with

3684.86 --> 3689.51
the width is likely to be retained or

3687.17 --> 3692.15
the the higher can be compressed so I

3689.51 --> 3695.5400000000004
wouldn't I wouldn't agree entirely with

3692.15 --> 3697.4900000000002
us okay so a yeah compression yep so we

3695.54 --> 3700.42
can we can say that this photo might be

3697.49 --> 3703.2799999999997
like something like 1 degree wide and

3700.42 --> 3704.9300000000003
0.8 degree high whatever when it comes

3703.28 --> 3707.78
in your camera well to be fair I've

3704.93 --> 3709.79
actually seen for the greater

3707.78 --> 3711.1400000000003
compression than the fact that you've

3709.79 --> 3715.91
just dropped off there which is point

3711.14 --> 3718.1
two one percent so no I would say you

3715.91 --> 3719.93
know in certain circumstances you can

3718.1 --> 3722.81
have compression that's two three times

3719.93 --> 3724.79
the total height of the width yep we're

3722.81 --> 3726.2599999999998
going to compression shortly

3724.79 --> 3728.9
the compression vertically right you're

3726.26 --> 3731.6600000000003
talking about yeah yeah okay so

3728.9 --> 3733.2200000000003
in these these red ones all I'm saying

3731.66 --> 3735.47
is that the distance the angular

3733.22 --> 3738.62
distance between the lighthouse and the

3735.47 --> 3744.5499999999997
turbine is 0.2 1 degrees that's just a

3738.62 --> 3748.91
difference in the heading okay and

3744.55 --> 3754.88
compression notwithstanding that scale

3748.91 --> 3756.77
also applies vertically so if we know if

3754.88 --> 3759.07
we know how many pixels there are

3756.77 --> 3761.66
between the lighthouse and the turbine

3759.07 --> 3766.28
and we know that equates to in angular

3761.66 --> 3771.44
size we can apply the same angular size

3766.28 --> 3772.34
to the lighthouse know well that's what

3771.44 --> 3774.05
I've just that's what I've just

3772.34 --> 3776.3
literally just disagreed here with that

3774.05 --> 3778.7000000000003
no no with compression no compression

3776.3 --> 3780.02
not withstanding okay compress it not

3778.7 --> 3782.39
with start so it'll dip into our

3780.02 --> 3784.97
understanding yeah so if if it was like

3782.39 --> 3787.7599999999998
a perfect atmosphere blah blah blah then

3784.97 --> 3790.75
it would apply perfectly but you know

3787.76 --> 3793.34
things can be compressed what-have-you

3790.75 --> 3795.98
so again with compression not

3793.34 --> 3798.9500000000003
withstanding if the focal height of the

3795.98 --> 3802.1
lighthouse is here and that's 80 point

3798.95 --> 3803.87
five meters so we know how big it is

3802.1 --> 3805.43
and we know how far away it is and

3803.87 --> 3810.73
therefore we can work out its angular

3805.43 --> 3814.91
size okay and the angular size is that

3810.73 --> 3817.37
0.168 degrees so we can also scale that

3814.91 --> 3821.12
we know how big that 80 point five

3817.37 --> 3824.99
meters is on the image again compression

3821.12 --> 3827.18
notwithstanding and given that we know

3824.99 --> 3829.8199999999997
how big it is we know that sea level at

3827.18 --> 3832.19
watch him up is this line at the bottom

3829.82 --> 3834.5
of that rectangle and again if you just

3832.19 --> 3837.31
do it linearly and say that's 80 meters

3834.5 --> 3839.75
then this is about 20 meters 20 meters

3837.31 --> 3841.97
okay I'm looking at the image you're

3839.75 --> 3843.83
presenting and putting it next to a

3841.97 --> 3846.29
ruler and it doesn't seem to be

3843.83 --> 3849.34
perfectly level the left side is

3846.29 --> 3854.87
actually lower than the right side so

3849.34 --> 3856.4
what couple pixels no like from the size

3854.87 --> 3860.15
it is on my screen like half a

3856.4 --> 3861.6
centimeter a literal size of the demo

3860.15 --> 3864.2400000000002
that's

3861.6 --> 3867.18
it's probably tilted like at least one

3864.24 --> 3868.95
and a half two degrees maybe okay that

3867.18 --> 3872.6099999999997
will make like one or two pixels maybe

3868.95 --> 3874.8799999999997
well on this picture a lot more so it's

3872.61 --> 3877.77
not perfectly straight it's not level

3874.88 --> 3880.26
it's slightly rotated the entire thing

3877.77 --> 3881.91
that's what I'm saying yeah sure but one

3880.26 --> 3884.28
or two degrees will not make much

3881.91 --> 3885.8399999999997
difference to the map at all we can

3884.28 --> 3887.88
demonstrate that I've make a lot of

3885.84 --> 3890.2200000000003
difference to something that's only

3887.88 --> 3892.86
visible with a very small angular size

3890.22 --> 3896.1299999999997
that rotation on the screen is going to

3892.86 --> 3897.7200000000003
matter a lot in its height the one thing

3896.13 --> 3899.88
I'm interested in is what do you think

3897.72 --> 3902.7599999999998
is causing any kind of blockage right

3899.88 --> 3904.86
there in your in your image do you think

3902.76 --> 3908.3100000000004
it's earth curvature that's causing the

3904.86 --> 3910.44
blockage yes yes I do you don't think he

3908.31 --> 3911.73
had anything to do with the tide had

3910.44 --> 3914.13
anything to do with the stormy

3911.73 --> 3916.8
conditions nothing like that now the

3914.13 --> 3918.3900000000003
tides like like Matata Rangers like a

3916.8 --> 3921.36
meter or something for Perth it was

3918.39 --> 3925.02
pretty negligible and you know what what

3921.36 --> 3927.0
saves the waves were on that day no but

3925.02 --> 3929.25
he is much much higher than the any

3927.0 --> 3931.2
possible waves that you could suggest

3929.25 --> 3934.05
and you wouldn't think that there's any

3931.2 --> 3937.5
kind of issues with the weather the

3934.05 --> 3938.88
conditioners this this match the

3937.5 --> 3941.58
standard refraction pretty well so I

3938.88 --> 3943.7400000000002
don't think there's any reason to think

3941.58 --> 3948.0
there's abnormal refraction up or down

3943.74 --> 3951.4199999999996
the terrestrial refraction right with

3948.0 --> 3953.82
that that the globe refraction that

3951.42 --> 3957.15
terrestrial reflection or actual sea

3953.82 --> 3961.28
ocean what's your distinction well one

3957.15 --> 3964.14
has a almost insignificant it causes

3961.28 --> 3966.6000000000004
insignificant but still slight deviation

3964.14 --> 3968.46
of light due to conditions and

3966.6 --> 3970.2
especially when transit when light

3968.46 --> 3973.32
transits through a separate type of

3970.2 --> 3975.4199999999996
medium it happens a lot but within the

3973.32 --> 3977.94
same medium very almost insignificant

3975.42 --> 3981.2400000000002
amount of deviation of the light tends

3977.94 --> 3983.58
to turn practically into blurring that's

3981.24 --> 3986.2799999999997
actual refraction terrestrial refraction

3983.58 --> 3991.5
is based on the assumption that light

3986.28 --> 3993.5400000000004
does been persistently over distance in

3991.5 --> 3995.429
order to make light go around the curve

3993.54 --> 3997.529
that's terrestrial fraction

3995.429 --> 4003.319
totally different effects it's not

3997.529 --> 4005.209
actually confirmed by optics so that's a

4003.319 --> 4007.7889999999998
difficult thing qui had this chat the

4005.209 --> 4009.859
other day do you accept that the accept

4007.789 --> 4016.009
that the air the surface is more dense

4009.859 --> 4020.419
in general than the air Hara there's

4016.009 --> 4022.729
more pressure yes yeah and we can we

4020.419 --> 4025.669
have like really well tested formulas to

4022.729 --> 4028.3089999999997
work out actual refractive indices for

4025.669 --> 4029.8089999999997
various conditions right yeah different

4028.309 --> 4033.9190000000003
pressures gives a different type of

4029.809 --> 4037.15
bending when light hits that specific

4033.919 --> 4041.299
location right but what it doesn't do is

4037.15 --> 4043.88
actually move in and then bend in a

4041.299 --> 4047.209
persistent path occur through that

4043.88 --> 4049.159
atmosphere it's a it's a corner turn

4047.209 --> 4051.739
that's basically what that refraction

4049.159 --> 4054.1400000000003
does it can't technically result in

4051.739 --> 4056.7490000000003
light bending around the curve it's

4054.14 --> 4059.5389999999998
physically impossible when you say you

4056.749 --> 4062.209
can't make a setup that does that unless

4059.539 --> 4064.909
you take well something that obviously

4062.209 --> 4066.769
doesn't literally correlate but optic

4064.909 --> 4068.539
fiber that's pretty much yeah you can

4066.769 --> 4071.419
bend light with optic fiber because it's

4068.539 --> 4073.5490000000004
reflecting within the fiber but you know

4071.419 --> 4077.689
the open atmosphere light can never do

4073.549 --> 4080.509
that it doesn't it takes a corner it

4077.689 --> 4082.3689999999997
doesn't Bend and then bends a little bit

4080.509 --> 4085.369
more and bends a little bit more over

4082.369 --> 4086.9590000000003
distance it doesn't work that way what

4085.369 --> 4089.929
do you mean by corner do you mean only

4086.959 --> 4093.6789999999996
bends once Danis in the medium

4089.929 --> 4095.15
transition yeah but there's a pretty

4093.679 --> 4097.159
smooth gradient in the atmosphere right

4095.15 --> 4099.5
there has nothing to do with that it's

4097.159 --> 4101.449
about the transition of the medium the

4099.5 --> 4104.27
light is going through and if that

4101.449 --> 4105.739
transition is barely anything because

4104.27 --> 4107.150000000001
it's basically in the same type of

4105.739 --> 4109.4
medium with only slight pressure

4107.15 --> 4112.808999999999
differences then the amount of

4109.4 --> 4118.098999999999
refraction there is insignificant

4112.809 --> 4120.079000000001
provably so that's fact it's only when

4118.099 --> 4122.809
the medium through which the light

4120.079 --> 4126.139
change red light goes radically changed

4122.809 --> 4127.969
like from open air into glass into a

4126.139 --> 4131.299
water-filled aquarium then

4127.969 --> 4133.549
and a total corner change happened

4131.299 --> 4137.2699999999995
significantly because the museums are so

4133.549 --> 4141.799
different in the open air not so radical

4137.27 --> 4145.069
at all they're almost readings and it

4141.799 --> 4147.23
does not bend gradually over distance

4145.069 --> 4150.109
it's a corner turn that's the real

4147.23 --> 4151.699
refraction do you know the scale of the

4150.109 --> 4154.1
numbers that we're talking about here in

4151.699 --> 4156.739
in refractive indexes yes I like going

4154.1 --> 4159.89
through you know how much how much light

4156.739 --> 4161.75
is deviated by open style by open

4159.89 --> 4164.27
refraction through the same medium in

4161.75 --> 4167.0
the air even with incredible conditions

4164.27 --> 4169.1900000000005
how much maneuvering room that

4167.0 --> 4177.13
refraction is how much light is actually

4169.19 --> 4178.91
deviated you know yeah it's under 0.1%

4177.13 --> 4184.969
what is it boy

4178.91 --> 4189.43
under point one percent total percentage

4184.969 --> 4195.949
deviation of the light which is

4189.43 --> 4199.88
literally almost immeasurable deviation

4195.949 --> 4201.83
it's literally insignificant so it's

4199.88 --> 4204.05
almost negligible it is kind of

4201.83 --> 4206.989
negligible in practice it's very small

4204.05 --> 4210.110000000001
but it adds up your oh it doesn't it

4206.989 --> 4214.58
doesn't that's the point it does not add

4210.11 --> 4217.61
up is it a single medium transition

4214.58 --> 4221.8099999999995
it doesn't pile on there is no

4217.61 --> 4225.11
cumulative refraction there's refraction

4221.81 --> 4229.34
or a medium it's that change it does not

4225.11 --> 4230.57
accumulate over distance yes not how

4229.34 --> 4234.59
refraction works

4230.57 --> 4236.78
you say it's a transition it's a corner

4234.59 --> 4239.57
within a medium transition that's how

4236.78 --> 4240.679999999999
refraction works right but you're saying

4239.57 --> 4243.08
to say you said you're saying that it

4240.68 --> 4245.570000000001
sort of light goes straight and then

4243.08 --> 4247.5199999999995
hits some density change in the

4245.57 --> 4250.239
atmosphere and refracts once and that's

4247.52 --> 4254.120000000001
it is that what you mean by a corner yes

4250.239 --> 4257.239
okay it takes place at the transit that

4254.12 --> 4259.5199999999995
the medium transition there is where

4257.239 --> 4261.7699999999995
they're fresh explained so if there is

4259.52 --> 4265.31
no abrupt medium transition

4261.77 --> 4267.59
like path weights then the total amount

4265.31 --> 4272.120000000001
that is been the total and it is not

4267.59 --> 4277.31
cumulative is in significant which means

4272.12 --> 4280.19
as good as not present and that is that

4277.31 --> 4287.05
in significance duck does not pile up

4280.19 --> 4289.969999999999
over distance it's not proven to

4287.05 --> 4292.43
accumulate that in significance and then

4289.97 --> 4296.650000000001
suddenly become significant its

4292.43 --> 4299.93
insignificant and it does not accumulate

4296.65 --> 4302.75
the refractive in significant amount

4299.93 --> 4304.58
over distance that doesn't happen you

4302.75 --> 4310.04
can't prove that that happens it's not

4304.58 --> 4313.13
established in optics okay right the

4310.04 --> 4317.33
density is a very smooth change from the

4313.13 --> 4319.78
surface up to however many meters above

4317.33 --> 4322.76
the sea level there is not just one

4319.78 --> 4325.719999999999
density change it is a constant change

4322.76 --> 4331.7300000000005
in density there is a density gradient

4325.72 --> 4334.67
yeah that's that's vertically over the

4331.73 --> 4336.74
earth that gradient is not gonna be

4334.67 --> 4338.72
there because the pressure is pretty

4336.74 --> 4340.73
much constant at a certain pressure

4338.72 --> 4343.400000000001
that's what you're looking faster past

4340.73 --> 4346.3099999999995
the earth on the same level the same

4343.4 --> 4349.91
pressure there's no gradient change to

4346.31 --> 4352.76
cause a curve yes there there is not

4349.91 --> 4355.4
there's a slight pressure differences

4352.76 --> 4360.08
within the same layer you're looking

4355.4 --> 4363.49
through light does not bend in a corner

4360.08 --> 4369.5199999999995
over distance refraction only is a

4363.49 --> 4369.5199999999995
corner turn through a medium change

4370.4 --> 4378.92
what does not curve at 7/6 of the

4373.31 --> 4381.47
Earth's radius Venus really can I just

4378.92 --> 4383.57
present something quickly before you go

4381.47 --> 4387.2
much further with this because yeah I'm

4383.57 --> 4389.179999999999
really interested to know what you think

4387.2 --> 4391.16
of the these two sets of data that I'm

4389.18 --> 4393.51
going to show you right now let me know

4391.16 --> 4396.78
when you see my screen hold on

4393.51 --> 4400.29
the weather on rottnest island yeah

4396.78 --> 4402.36
click on you know I'll click on you they

4400.29 --> 4404.43
go yep so you've seen the video that he

4402.36 --> 4407.94
released and you know I mean I've seen

4404.43 --> 4411.66
the video to the Rottnest Island today

4407.94 --> 4413.25
we have 20 degrees and we have a light

4411.66 --> 4415.139999999999
breeze of 12 miles an hour that's not

4413.25 --> 4421.2
very windy at all you would agree with

4415.14 --> 4423.150000000001
that which sets nothing [ __ ] city yeah

4421.2 --> 4424.65
it's not nothing but it's not like a day

4423.15 --> 4426.2699999999995
that was being filmed on the day that

4424.65 --> 4429.33
was being filmed it was substantially

4426.27 --> 4431.580000000001
breezier than that probably yeah if we

4429.33 --> 4433.59
look at this is this is the historical

4431.58 --> 4437.7
one eve data and a significant wave

4433.59 --> 4440.82
height and it's in graph form explaining

4437.7 --> 4444.0
like today solace at all yesterday 4th

4440.82 --> 4447.63
of May yesterday for instance we have 2

4444.0 --> 4449.61
meter high significant wave heights if

4447.63 --> 4451.77
we go back onto Wednesday

4449.61 --> 4453.96
1st of May they go up to as much as

4451.77 --> 4456.9890000000005
three and a half meters so we're talking

4453.96 --> 4459.87
what bring half meters 12 feet roughly

4456.989 --> 4461.849999999999
sea swells in this location this is

4459.87 --> 4465.39
rottnest island significant wave have

4461.85 --> 4466.77
high graphic we've got you know even on

4465.39 --> 4470.13
normal calm days you're looking at

4466.77 --> 4471.93
probably a six foot swell but would you

4470.13 --> 4474.6900000000005
agree them when you say when we look at

4471.93 --> 4477.18
those images that you showed on a quite

4474.69 --> 4479.219999999999
windy day that it's likely that we're

4477.18 --> 4481.08
probably looking closer to 4 meter

4479.22 --> 4484.41
swells or not on that particular day so

4481.08 --> 4486.87
I know you said news pic sorry I have no

4484.41 --> 4488.91
idea what it looks like he's at I

4486.87 --> 4491.82
haven't actually spoken about this with

4488.91 --> 4496.8
Mitchell yet I think he's at 8 meters

4491.82 --> 4498.2699999999995
above the water ok so I don't see how

4496.8 --> 4501.51
much relevance the 3 or 4 meter wave

4498.27 --> 4503.040000000001
could have not very much you don't right

4501.51 --> 4506.030000000001
ok so you deny

4503.04 --> 4510.84
well what elevation did he say he was up

4506.03 --> 4514.41
in the video he said 5 meters in text he

4510.84 --> 4516.03
said 2 to 3 so we've got a bit of a

4514.41 --> 4519.96
barrier I don't know Buffy mother's not

4516.03 --> 4522.32
here so okay so unless Capote if we give

4519.96 --> 4524.9890000000005
him an arbitrary 3 then he's going to

4522.32 --> 4528.29
looking or at least if he if he's higher

4524.989 --> 4531.169999999999
than three we need to know the date that

4528.29 --> 4533.239
the type type hikes the wave heights was

4531.17 --> 4535.1900000000005
it high timers at low tide how high

4533.239 --> 4537.86
above actual sea level was he at the

4535.19 --> 4540.7699999999995
time and then we have to subtract that

4537.86 --> 4543.5
from his elevation so when we're going

4540.77 --> 4545.0
to his elevation above sea level right

4543.5 --> 4547.25
what that means is if you put eight

4545.0 --> 4549.77
meters in that's incorrect because if

4547.25 --> 4552.079
you have a for me to swell of waves in

4549.77 --> 4555.59
front of you technically your height as

4552.079 --> 4559.4
well waves waves technically you are

4555.59 --> 4561.619000000001
only four meters above sea level because

4559.4 --> 4563.449
you're looking across if you were

4561.619 --> 4566.449
looking across a flat plane that it

4563.449 --> 4568.79
would be flat water would be flat with

4566.449 --> 4570.619
waves that's four meters if it's an A

4568.79 --> 4572.21
for elevation obviously you have to

4570.619 --> 4574.848999999999
subtract that so you can't give him the

4572.21 --> 4576.86
eight foot above sea level because that

4574.849 --> 4579.26
would be incorrect so I know you said

4576.86 --> 4581.598999999999
that the observation matches with

4579.26 --> 4583.369000000001
standard refraction I assume he just put

4581.599 --> 4585.59
in eight meters into that and you didn't

4583.369 --> 4586.969
take into account the actual height of

4585.59 --> 4589.88
the waves at the time that he would have

4586.969 --> 4592.369
been looking across because if you did

4589.88 --> 4596.3
that what you would find is that it

4592.369 --> 4598.159
didn't match standard refraction all

4596.3 --> 4600.110000000001
right no I see what you mean I'm saying

4598.159 --> 4601.79
he's at eight meters and I don't know

4600.11 --> 4603.71
how tall these waves are in the footage

4601.79 --> 4605.84
I don't think they're four meters four

4603.71 --> 4607.52
meters is a big wave well you forget

4605.84 --> 4610.639
perspective I mean he zoomed in with the

4607.52 --> 4613.13
p1000 there so you know it's quite small

4610.639 --> 4615.11
too on the p1000 you know if he's

4613.13 --> 4617.3
looking quite across out to water I mean

4615.11 --> 4618.469
it's gonna look big yeah but you

4617.3 --> 4620.0
understand that the four meter waves

4618.469 --> 4622.07
when you're above four meters in

4620.0 --> 4624.44
elevation four meter waves can only

4622.07 --> 4626.78
block as much as four meters yeah well

4624.44 --> 4629.419999999999
first I wonder with well I just like you

4626.78 --> 4631.639
to agree with I'm true then what just a

4629.42 --> 4633.77
minute I just want me to isn't okay the

4631.639 --> 4636.32
putting an eight meter above sea level

4633.77 --> 4638.150000000001
on the day in question when you have

4636.32 --> 4638.96
those significant waves that are clearly

4638.15 --> 4641.48
on the image

4638.96 --> 4643.31
you cannot give an arbitrary eight

4641.48 --> 4645.409
meters above sea level you have to

4643.31 --> 4647.6900000000005
subtract that first and foremost off the

4645.409 --> 4649.579
observer then seven then I can look at

4647.69 --> 4652.04
these ways and go on maybe they cause

4649.579 --> 4654.19
ahem a track this nice one well we don't

4652.04 --> 4657.76
even on the car most of David

4654.19 --> 4659.65
a significant wave height of less than a

4657.76 --> 4662.320000000001
meter and a half to two meters roughly

4659.65 --> 4664.9
yes by the way we have this graph on

4662.32 --> 4667.57
this graph here yeah we have had some

4664.9 --> 4669.549999999999
significant wave action around the south

4667.57 --> 4671.32
coast of Australia I don't know whether

4669.55 --> 4673.2390000000005
extended the person well when they say

4671.32 --> 4675.58
significant wave all that means is that

4673.239 --> 4677.11
it's the highest the average height of

4675.58 --> 4679.449
the the highest one third of the waves

4677.11 --> 4682.389999999999
recorded so it doesn't necessarily mean

4679.449 --> 4684.46
a significant label a tsunami type it's

4682.39 --> 4687.4890000000005
literally I know I made a few days ago

4684.46 --> 4689.44
today a few days ago in Victoria

4687.489 --> 4694.449
especially they closed a lot of the

4689.44 --> 4697.179999999999
surfing beaches ok right so the waves

4694.449 --> 4699.9
are just big is that there it's very

4697.18 --> 4701.110000000001
high and low there as well or not

4699.9 --> 4703.2699999999995
majorly

4701.11 --> 4707.41
all right so the tighter not so high the

4703.27 --> 4710.9490000000005
the ocean is just rougher cause it looks

4707.41 --> 4712.63
a lot of wigs yeah I looked at the

4710.949 --> 4713.349999999999
footage and I go that they're not for me

4712.63 --> 4715.09
two waves

4713.35 --> 4717.7300000000005
yeah but how can you tell that when you

4715.09 --> 4721.06
through how can you tell up through the

4717.73 --> 4723.218999999999
image through the footage yeah how can

4721.06 --> 4724.81
you see help me yeah how can you solve

4723.219 --> 4727.27
what me oh wait a wives are pretty big

4724.81 --> 4729.13
hold on hold on even if they were

4727.27 --> 4731.38
smaller they're still gonna be tidal

4729.13 --> 4736.0
bulge because you were looking from the

4731.38 --> 4738.67
coast over over the ocean close by and

4736.0 --> 4740.5
yeah if they're auto bulge that's right

4738.67 --> 4742.51
Randy did you get my email from the

4740.5 --> 4744.04
author of that paper I did and I'm so

4742.51 --> 4746.17
glad that you scented me because it's

4744.04 --> 4747.73
it's actually something that nobody's

4746.17 --> 4751.39
ever admitted before that we do actually

4747.73 --> 4753.25
get a tidal bulge in those locations

4751.39 --> 4755.08
thank you very much I know in his

4753.25 --> 4759.58
opinion it's only a few centimeters

4755.08 --> 4761.71
however that is an actual that is an

4759.58 --> 4763.36
artic that is a localized bulge not

4761.71 --> 4766.36
caused by the earth curve caused by the

4763.36 --> 4768.91
pressure of the incoming tide so thank

4766.36 --> 4772.0
you very much for confirming that really

4768.91 --> 4774.699
great okay excellent

4772.0 --> 4778.63
Cheers so of course a couple of

4774.699 --> 4780.639999999999
centimeters not 10 no but if you say

4778.63 --> 4782.679
Senate hold on if you say these things

4780.64 --> 4785.469
are obstructing a couple of centimeters

4782.679 --> 4787.07
then you're already assuming it in an

4785.469 --> 4789.38
auto graphic way

4787.07 --> 4791.329
because over distance that couple of

4789.38 --> 4795.29
centimeters close why is going to be

4791.329 --> 4800.049999999999
huge amounts because when you're above

4795.29 --> 4802.159
it no it will still release it will stay

4800.05 --> 4807.5
even if you are above it

4802.159 --> 4809.78
oh do you guys know it a triangle I know

4807.5 --> 4812.96
the perspective works and that it

4809.78 --> 4818.3
definitely doesn't work like geometry or

4812.96 --> 4820.61
if you align between two points and say

4818.3 --> 4822.7390000000005
oh look this should look like this

4820.61 --> 4825.0199999999995
because the geometry lines up and then

4822.739 --> 4828.11
you actually make the set of physical

4825.02 --> 4831.469
and with a camera and then it turns out

4828.11 --> 4835.579
not the lineup because geometry does not

4831.469 --> 4839.54
represent optics properly it can't see

4835.579 --> 4842.21
me so much it is and there are I don't

4839.54 --> 4844.54
know 50 centimeter waves how much of

4842.21 --> 4849.26
that on a flat earth how much of that

4844.54 --> 4853.25
can obscure the distant object that

4849.26 --> 4856.099
depends how far away it is and how but

4853.25 --> 4858.71
the further away the more of a bigger

4856.099 --> 4863.84
object can be Constance half a meter

4858.71 --> 4866.449
when the answer is 50 centimeters no

4863.84 --> 4869.0
there's no singular answer that's the

4866.449 --> 4871.219
problem it all depends how big is the

4869.0 --> 4873.32
thing and how far away in relation to

4871.219 --> 4876.8
that thing closer by that so definitely

4873.32 --> 4881.509999999999
small it really does matter cool

4876.8 --> 4883.55
I'm at eight meters and literally one

4881.51 --> 4885.59
meter into the beach there is a 50

4883.55 --> 4891.409000000001
centimeter wave can I see over the top

4885.59 --> 4894.29
of it probably at first but further away

4891.409 --> 4897.11
that 10 centimeter wave is eventually

4894.29 --> 4904.07
gonna end up in an apparent horizon and

4897.11 --> 4906.079
it will start to up now yeah on a flat

4904.07 --> 4911.2699999999995
earth because it's still subjected to

4906.079 --> 4913.88
optics which apply so so things in the

4911.27 --> 4916.969
near foreground will and the obstructing

4913.88 --> 4919.07
things in the Far background because of

4916.969 --> 4921.2300000000005
angular science differences even if you

4919.07 --> 4925.239
are technically slightly eye

4921.23 --> 4928.599999999999
if the distance between you and the

4925.239 --> 4933.349999999999
obstructing object in front of you is

4928.6 --> 4935.360000000001
fast enough and the object even further

4933.35 --> 4939.2300000000005
away concealed by that is even further

4935.36 --> 4940.61
away then that will happen I just put

4939.23 --> 4942.29
you the comment in the side could you

4940.61 --> 4944.299999999999
read that to me Rohit

4942.29 --> 4946.07
it's the expense of the two serviced by

4944.3 --> 4948.83
internal tides at most a few centimetres

4946.07 --> 4952.489
fussen where did you get to 70 meters

4948.83 --> 4956.39
from I thought I said a few centimeters

4952.489 --> 4959.48
no you said to you specified - yeah you

4956.39 --> 4961.429
did well okay few centimeters huh

4959.48 --> 4962.959999999999
now what's a few though what the

4961.429 --> 4965.87
clusters if you mean how do I know that

4962.96 --> 4967.61
he's the authority on this is just one

4965.87 --> 4969.71
per for you you are quoting him as an

4967.61 --> 4971.42
authority no no he used took me about

4969.71 --> 4973.85
him you asked me about him originally

4971.42 --> 4977.15
and said did I get your email from him

4973.85 --> 4979.909000000001
yes I did and this is his opinion that

4977.15 --> 4981.5599999999995
it's a few 70 meters so if it's his

4979.909 --> 4983.42
opinion it's a few centimetres what's a

4981.56 --> 4985.04
few first and foremost and second is he

4983.42 --> 4986.96
the multiple authority on this always

4985.04 --> 4990.08
all the people that might say a few feet

4986.96 --> 4992.4800000000005
I don't care you have part of him as an

4990.08 --> 4995.03
authority well I've quoted him as a few

4992.48 --> 4996.5
centimetres that's more than two so I'm

4995.03 --> 4999.0199999999995
glad you brought it up dogs at least a

4996.5 --> 5001.239
few centimetres of the localized bulging

4999.02 --> 5004.6900000000005
is certainly not included in the curve

5001.239 --> 5006.428999999999
calculators you quoted him because

5004.69 --> 5008.62
you're trying to explain the was a des

5006.429 --> 5013.36
of the camera man's footage of the boats

5008.62 --> 5014.92
yeah cargo ship yep yeah did you quote

5013.36 --> 5018.04
him as saying that it could account for

5014.92 --> 5021.6990000000005
10 metres of bulge or a couple

5018.04 --> 5024.25
centimeters I did okay okay what's

5021.699 --> 5027.58
what's the problem well it's not problem

5024.25 --> 5029.56
it drew out yourself to go and research

5027.58 --> 5031.659
that and do my work for me if I have

5029.56 --> 5033.9400000000005
said that it has been a fear of thoughts

5031.659 --> 5036.009999999999
or a few centimetres you guys would have

5033.94 --> 5038.29
just completely ignored it the fact that

5036.01 --> 5040.150000000001
I say 10th see you still don't

5038.29 --> 5043.54
understand how I go about getting my

5040.15 --> 5046.0
getting you guys to admit things that

5043.54 --> 5048.1
are blatantly obvious so this is how I

5046.0 --> 5049.48
do this kind of stuff you know you've

5048.1 --> 5051.13
not worked it out there yet I've

5049.48 --> 5053.199
deliberately put stuff out there so that

5051.13 --> 5054.46
you go and prove me wrong but in actual

5053.199 --> 5057.009999999999
proving me wrong

5054.46 --> 5058.75
actually prove me right and she's good

5057.01 --> 5062.02
because you guys do it every time it's

5058.75 --> 5063.969
so funny it's like probably the inferior

5062.02 --> 5065.5
Mirage you guys never gave ground on

5063.969 --> 5068.2300000000005
that you never gave ground on

5065.5 --> 5070.0
compression you never gave god you've

5068.23 --> 5071.709999999999
literally gone against everything that

5070.0 --> 5073.21
I've said over the past 18 months and

5071.71 --> 5075.64
now apparently you're all in agreement

5073.21 --> 5079.6
with it well it's funny that isn't it it

5075.64 --> 5081.969
really is it's awful I agree your video

5079.6 --> 5083.4400000000005
about explaining the the cargo ships

5081.969 --> 5085.09
being obscured by weather

5083.44 --> 5087.489
I know it was I know exactly what the

5085.09 --> 5089.110000000001
video was really I'd say if you don't

5087.489 --> 5091.209999999999
know how I draw this information out of

5089.11 --> 5092.889999999999
you guys and get you guys to admit

5091.21 --> 5095.14
something that you would never have

5092.89 --> 5096.64
previously admitted obviously you don't

5095.14 --> 5097.950000000001
know the traps that I'm laying for you

5096.64 --> 5102.76
guys and you fall for it every time

5097.95 --> 5106.11
brilliant absolutely brilliant it is and

5102.76 --> 5108.1900000000005
with that I am gonna round out the show
