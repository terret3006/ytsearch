2.38 --> 9.7
good morning

4.49 --> 13.969
this is Flat Earth early-bird episode 12

9.7 --> 18.86
today I have one guest with me music

13.969 --> 23.57
freak MC hello William

18.86 --> 26.15
hello thanks for coming Yeah right

23.57 --> 30.53
before the show started

26.15 --> 33.82
poof William here brought up that he was

30.53 --> 40.07
digging into some serious optic research

33.82 --> 43.67
optics about the nature of angular

40.07 --> 49.28
resolution and lenses and how telescopes

43.67 --> 52.94
function and how mirrors used change the

49.28 --> 56.11
diffraction limit and such and who it

52.94 --> 61.718999999999994
was yeah he showed me a lot of data

56.11 --> 61.719
sources was fascinating so with William

75.61 --> 79.27
and yummy

90.869 --> 97.649
and yummy now yes sorry my internet

94.27 --> 102.31
connection got interrupted

97.649 --> 105.81
you're like a mute still yeah yeah yeah

102.31 --> 109.45
I noticed it was freezing on master too

105.81 --> 111.52
right oh yeah by the way to remind our

109.45 --> 115.179
listeners and viewers

111.52 --> 118.0
Nathan Oakley is simulcasting well not

115.179 --> 120.729
on the show at least that I know of yet

118.0 --> 124.39
but he is also starting his show on the

120.729 --> 126.31
flat earth debates yeah we we're gonna

124.39 --> 127.81
do this like this pretty much every

126.31 --> 130.31900000000002
Monday I think he's starting one hour

127.81 --> 136.09
early and I just start on time as usual

130.319 --> 138.13
so yeah but if you hang around here we

136.09 --> 140.89000000000001
got something interesting too relating

138.13 --> 145.41
to optics very relevant to the Flat

140.89 --> 151.42
Earth debate so William enlighten us

145.41 --> 167.41
what you're doing okay well I just hear

151.42 --> 170.23
my scream with me okay we can this just

167.41 --> 175.06
thought up a bit of basics of an angular

170.23 --> 178.51
resolution or otherwise some people also

175.06 --> 180.43
know a special evolution it basically

178.51 --> 183.57899999999998
describes the ability of an image

180.43 --> 188.109
forming device such as an optical or

183.579 --> 191.38
radio telescope a microscope a camera or

188.109 --> 193.78
an eye to distinguish an object they

191.38 --> 196.18
were making a major determinant of image

193.78 --> 199.54
resolution in physics and Geosciences

196.18 --> 202.48000000000002
and the term special resolution refers

199.54 --> 206.709
to the precision of a measurement with

202.48 --> 208.66
respect to space now I'm just gonna take

206.709 --> 212.849
a put on the highlighted information

208.66 --> 212.849
first owning of image forming of Oscars

216.51 --> 227.10999999999999
okay see oh by the way because where did

223.39 --> 229.92999999999998
you get this document from this document

227.11 --> 232.39000000000001
is available on meat in it if you search

229.93 --> 236.23000000000002
of them image resolution comes up as

232.39 --> 240.819
well but why did you download it from

236.23 --> 245.76899999999998
that's what I'm I can provide all links

240.819 --> 247.81
to all the sides and information that

245.769 --> 252.31
will be great if you could post them in

247.81 --> 255.97
the chat or or of on skype I'll post

252.31 --> 258.549
them in the in the YouTube chat but take

255.97 --> 259.959
your time you can you can even post it

258.549 --> 261.489
in your description and the guys can

259.959 --> 263.01
watch the video later can even look it

261.489 --> 268.12
up yes sure

263.01 --> 271.419
anyway please continue okay image

268.12 --> 274.75
forming of us okay now this is also a

271.419 --> 277.419
very controversial topic because it

274.75 --> 279.88
required it says in optics and image

277.419 --> 283.599
forming optical system is a system

279.88 --> 286.139
capable of being used for imaging the

283.599 --> 289.65999999999997
diameter of the aperture of the main

286.139 --> 292.3
objective is a common criterion for

289.66 --> 294.76000000000005
comparison among optical systems such as

292.3 --> 297.0
large telescopes through traditional

294.76 --> 302.08
systems or mirror systems which are

297.0 --> 305.47
referred to as Catholics the topic the

302.08 --> 309.96999999999997
top topics okay and Lane systems by

305.47 --> 312.34000000000003
optics oh and also but it was used in

309.97 --> 320.65000000000003
the late 20th century optical fiber was

312.34 --> 331.419
introduced as well top tricks and die up

320.65 --> 334.92999999999995
tricks optics systems and dialects or

331.419 --> 335.77
name systems now these are made in

334.93 --> 337.66
different ways

335.77 --> 339.789
if the cars are familial interest you

337.66 --> 342.46000000000004
get less people into loss lenses and

339.789 --> 344.8
each one of those where they earn the

342.46 --> 348.4
painting or in the latency of it will

344.8 --> 350.22
have its own attractive option defective

348.4 --> 354.4
limits you to burn

350.22 --> 356.71000000000004
lots of plastic or optical father on the

354.4 --> 358.06
other hand doesn't have a focal point

356.71 --> 360.54999999999995
but la semilla

358.06 --> 369.49
will always have a focal point we ain't

360.55 --> 372.37
spoken but also optical far back

369.49 --> 374.86
transpose an image from one they used to

372.37 --> 380.889
word plainly to another with art of any

374.86 --> 382.47
of people focus which is kind of

380.889 --> 387.25
interesting if you think about it

382.47 --> 392.68
because a lot of diffraction happens

387.25 --> 396.0
with the ability of photo if you do not

392.68 --> 398.38
have a focal point you are not

396.0 --> 404.11
especially in at that point and there

398.38 --> 406.21
with the sofa topics and I took a point

404.11 --> 407.949
in itself but I think I'll actually

406.21 --> 413.62
bring that up on my screen

407.949 --> 421.05
Oh actually go to the website angular

413.62 --> 421.05
resolution okay image forming opticals

421.289 --> 431.01
okay focal point and let's open up the

424.69 --> 435.34
focal point so could you oh hey Travis

431.01 --> 438.28
hey what's up Arlen Travis looking

435.34 --> 444.52
through a music and Williamses research

438.28 --> 447.30999999999995
it's really interesting okay geometrical

444.52 --> 449.79999999999995
optics a focus also called an image

447.31 --> 452.71
point is the point where large rays

449.8 --> 456.37
originating from a point on the object

452.71 --> 458.10999999999996
converge although the focus is

456.37 --> 462.07
conceptually a point physically the

458.11 --> 465.639
focus has a spatula extends code the

462.07 --> 468.669
blur circle this non of your focusing

465.639 --> 472.93
may be caused by regressions or the

468.669 --> 476.099
imaging optics and glosses also a major

472.93 --> 481.0
contributor to aberrations in an image

476.099 --> 483.58
as well as most lenses in absence of

481.0 --> 485.56
significant aberrations the small

483.58 --> 488.71
as possible blue circles is the airy

485.56 --> 492.31
disc which is caused by refraction from

488.71 --> 495.18899999999996
the optical systems aperture aberrations

492.31 --> 498.52
came to get worse as the aperture

495.189 --> 504.09900000000005
diameter increases while the airy circle

498.52 --> 508.12
is the smallest for large apertures so

504.099 --> 509.919
actually when actually if you really get

508.12 --> 512.7090000000001
involved in actually understand this

509.919 --> 516.399
there is a wide variety of information

512.709 --> 519.1899999999999
out there for people to look at which

516.399 --> 527.769
will be willing to provide all the

519.19 --> 533.6800000000001
things gods modern EMI didn't you say

527.769 --> 535.66
that as well they prevail me this is why

533.68 --> 541.029
I'd have to recommend that you try to

535.66 --> 544.269
make a non life video recorded video

541.029 --> 546.579
just really make a good presentation to

544.269 --> 548.76
take your time because every time the

546.579 --> 552.91
life connection with you it's always

548.76 --> 556.0
it's too bad because this is fantastic

552.91 --> 559.75
information this is really good it's a

556.0 --> 560.589
it's another layer of depth as to what

559.75 --> 567.0
we're dealing with

560.589 --> 567.0
and yeah it's big optics is big it's

567.3 --> 572.579
yeah it's just big there's a lot to it

573.459 --> 579.819
okay also let's look at a camera for

577.059 --> 582.429
instance a camera is an optical

579.819 --> 586.149
instrument for capturing still images or

582.429 --> 588.819
for recording moving images which are

586.149 --> 591.959
stored in a physical medium that as a

588.819 --> 595.149
digital system for a photographic film

591.959 --> 597.1289999999999
the camera is the main instrument in the

595.149 --> 600.069
art of photography and captured images

597.129 --> 602.139
and may be reproduced later as part of

600.069 --> 605.3499999999999
the process of photography digital

602.139 --> 608.23
imaging and photographic printing the

605.35 --> 611.35
word camera comes from camera obscura

608.23 --> 613.4490000000001
which means dark chamber and the letter

611.35 --> 616.3290000000001
name from the middle of the bath for

613.449 --> 618.42
projecting an image of external reality

616.329 --> 621.3389999999999
on that surface

618.42 --> 624.9699999999999
the modern photographic camera evolved

621.339 --> 626.619
from the camera obscura the functioning

624.97 --> 630.339
of the camera is very similar to the

626.619 --> 632.379
functioning of the human eye the camera

630.339 --> 636.1790000000001
is a remote sensing the bar and the

632.379 --> 636.179
sense of subject to add any content

637.74 --> 646.299
which is also a very interesting topic

642.569 --> 648.7299999999999
if you go into all these additional

646.299 --> 658.509
platform that they are not made of Avadh

648.73 --> 660.73
with the document yeah if you take apart

658.509 --> 662.259
the the description then you look at

660.73 --> 664.499
what are in the descriptions you can

662.259 --> 667.42
find amazing things about these things

664.499 --> 671.8190000000001
but the most common thing that I came to

667.42 --> 675.24
have a problem with is when they start

671.819 --> 680.9799999999999
referring to planets draws near Leila's

675.24 --> 684.73
yeah considering well not a bit of fun

680.98 --> 688.809
information now they say that radio

684.73 --> 692.9490000000001
transmission a so-called satellites is

688.809 --> 696.61
impossible yet almost a hundred almost a

692.949 --> 698.579
hundred eight years before the coconuts

696.61 --> 701.139
were even possible

698.579 --> 705.92
they had radio transmissions that went

701.139 --> 707.6
across the Atlantic yeah

705.92 --> 710.9799999999999
I remember within the early nineteen

707.6 --> 717.3190000000001
condoms yeah it's the old radio towers

710.98 --> 718.939
yeah but this does that we need a laugh

717.319 --> 720.769
and all these ridiculous because you

718.939 --> 723.5889999999999
just need a high enough point to project

720.769 --> 728.049
the signal far enough you do not mean

723.589 --> 729.98
that alot in space there is I altered to

728.049 --> 731.72
balloons that they say that as weather

729.98 --> 733.48
balloon have the capacity of singing out

731.72 --> 740.149
signal that fall from there not

733.48 --> 742.999
definitely just a Zeppelin with yeah

740.149 --> 746.899
with a big transmission system on it

742.999 --> 752.359
yeah works work would cover a wide wide

746.899 --> 753.709
wide region so yes it's not the same

752.359 --> 755.389
thing that they say when you look

753.709 --> 757.8789999999999
through the telescopes with the shape of

755.389 --> 759.499
stars and things like that it's all good

757.879 --> 761.5690000000001
and well to have that overhead

759.499 --> 764.72
information wonderful you got it okay

761.569 --> 767.7389999999999
now can they please explain to me this

764.72 --> 770.36
now with the virtual limits of mirror

767.739 --> 771.919
lenses and all these things how much is

770.36 --> 780.259
that affecting the image you're actually

771.919 --> 784.489
I see well it depends on the nature of

780.259 --> 787.939
how it's built really like yeah are they

784.489 --> 792.0790000000001
using maybe they're not using standard

787.939 --> 795.579
lens filming maybe they're using like

792.079 --> 797.899
other type of scanning a lot of your

795.579 --> 798.7589999999999
diffraction the pins on the latency of

797.899 --> 802.809
the

798.759 --> 805.4590000000001
the eye to the lens they are using

802.809 --> 807.709
because at the end of the day the

805.459 --> 813.829
latency is going to even restrict or in

807.709 --> 815.539
haunts your the fraction limit so either

813.829 --> 817.4799999999999
what the long range is I have a too

815.539 --> 822.049
short diffraction limit because the

817.48 --> 825.439
fraction takes effect on this wind your

822.049 --> 827.569
lowest angle collides with your further

825.439 --> 829.549
as angle that's where it takes a big you

827.569 --> 832.7299999999999
could only you can only have a clear

829.549 --> 835.489
image as far as your lowest angle now

832.73 --> 837.379
once you've got anything past you Louis

835.489 --> 839.4200000000001
angle that's hard that's weird sauce

837.379 --> 845.33
disappearing from the bottom up

839.42 --> 848.18
your RK no longer see that angle it's a

845.33 --> 851.87
whole basis of it's very complicated in

848.18 --> 853.6099999999999
the terms of how they operated but once

851.87 --> 856.96
you dig into the stuff you thought you

853.61 --> 863.42
realized that they are potentially

856.96 --> 868.07
numerous robots to this argument first

863.42 --> 870.5
in terms in terms of the imaging behind

868.07 --> 872.95
it especially when it comes to your your

870.5 --> 876.8
main optical devices like your large

872.95 --> 879.2900000000001
telescopes and things and the only way

876.8 --> 881.4499999999999
to figure that out would be to do it

879.29 --> 883.4599999999999
it's just kinetic dissection of those

881.45 --> 894.95
devices figure out how they both are

883.46 --> 902.0600000000001
they offer goes yeah but are they gonna

894.95 --> 904.07
let us do that and get like the

902.06 --> 911.14
blueprints because the boxes where we

904.07 --> 913.7600000000001
can actually get some information and

911.14 --> 916.31
see how we can figure out how these

913.76 --> 929.06
things weigh in the floors now in a

916.31 --> 952.9399999999999
design I just want to bring up something

929.06 --> 954.8599999999999
creepy you see that's what people tell

952.94 --> 958.4000000000001
us they really were telescope faces

954.86 --> 962.57
works with the mirrors some of them some

958.4 --> 965.24
of them were late with latency glasses a

962.57 --> 967.82
net but all of them even your mellow

965.24 --> 971.48
ones contain latency losses which also

967.82 --> 974.35
begs a question about our accurate the

971.48 --> 974.35
measurements are

982.18 --> 990.89
things long that's not really one of

987.77 --> 994.54
those is it like one of the biggest

990.89 --> 997.13
because I've seen like a really wide run

994.54 --> 997.8499999999999
let me open up this quick encountered I

997.13 --> 1001.959
octaves

997.85 --> 1010.32
this is and catadioptric certainly not

1001.959 --> 1013.66
fifty millimeter aperture very nice but

1010.32 --> 1014.2900000000001
if you notice yeah you see inside the

1013.66 --> 1017.05
telescope

1014.29 --> 1023.41
okay the gloss is amazing and then you

1017.05 --> 1025.72
get this aperture yeah yeah which one

1023.41 --> 1030.309
which of course seems to be a circular

1025.72 --> 1033.67
aperture yeah you know what you

1030.309 --> 1035.829
understand about a circular aperture yes

1033.67 --> 1037.63
you will get some something in the image

1035.829 --> 1048.089
that resembles a curve a circular

1037.63 --> 1048.0890000000002
aperture because of its desire all right

1048.99 --> 1058.15
image if you look at how it worked you

1054.37 --> 1063.9099999999999
see the most and it bounces the image to

1058.15 --> 1067.77
what you can see all these lands are

1063.91 --> 1072.5800000000002
like imaging movements so it bounces off

1067.77 --> 1077.8
there you go another which bounces back

1072.58 --> 1083.6499999999999
to the eye huh it's funny which I don't

1077.8 --> 1085.6599999999999
see it's a mirror system yes yes so so

1083.65 --> 1087.6100000000001
if you look at it in this context it's

1085.66 --> 1089.71
very much unlikely that they pick two

1087.61 --> 1097.99
dolls because mothers tend to distort

1089.71 --> 1100.78
images by reversal of the image okay so

1097.99 --> 1103.75
any indication as to how this will

1100.78 --> 1107.29
influence the image that you're looking

1103.75 --> 1111.52
at through this thing now of course I've

1107.29 --> 1113.98
been researching into this and gonna do

1111.52 --> 1115.74
some more in depth into the effects of

1113.98 --> 1121.6
loss on

1115.74 --> 1124.09
on the complete system there's this is

1121.6 --> 1125.98
actually going to be a very wide it just

1124.09 --> 1127.6299999999999
would have to be discussed as a single

1125.98 --> 1131.05
topic on this other you need is

1127.63 --> 1136.93
telescopes because there's going to be a

1131.05 --> 1138.76
lot of information roving around us but

1136.93 --> 1140.6200000000001
we will get to that but first I want to

1138.76 --> 1152.44
get through the main the main I can

1140.62 --> 1161.5
break it down into sections so okay so

1152.44 --> 1168.99
let's go are you listening to the

1161.5 --> 1168.99
flutters debates that's good okay

1169.35 --> 1173.73
amazingly let's not go to the other room

1176.55 --> 1196.09
David Reed is listening to spiders

1178.99 --> 1197.98
debates yes I can obviously maybe what

1196.09 --> 1205.48
are they what is ready talking about

1197.98 --> 1209.2
sorry to momen I've only just got home

1205.48 --> 1212.02
now Oh Santa isn't even come on yet

1209.2 --> 1215.77
right okay I'm going to bring up

1212.02 --> 1229.87
something this is about geometrical

1215.77 --> 1237.73
optics okay block this now you see this

1229.87 --> 1244.53
is how the focusing works on a system so

1237.73 --> 1246.48
basically you see over we not do dance

1244.53 --> 1252.799
and you mean

1246.48 --> 1257.909
I am B and the circle area and it is it

1252.799 --> 1262.23
blurs that blue circle mentioned in

1257.909 --> 1264.269
Athena okay a lot come every points

1262.23 --> 1266.789
prints in different directions she lays

1264.269 --> 1270.179
in a single point of retina when this

1266.789 --> 1277.139
does not happen the source protein is

1270.179 --> 1281.159
seen blurry or out of focus the amount

1277.139 --> 1282.7199999999998
of information that is available for

1281.159 --> 1287.159
people if they ask you when you research

1282.72 --> 1289.8890000000001
this it's a very interesting topic and a

1287.159 --> 1291.8690000000001
pretty much party honest and a lot of

1289.889 --> 1301.519
water that's going on in the world

1291.869 --> 1307.1689999999999
around you okay let's go back yeah okay

1301.519 --> 1310.669
that one but focused on the on two

1307.169 --> 1314.159
different images now you see you there

1310.669 --> 1319.95
the focus art and the end of focus is

1314.159 --> 1321.509
there now the focus is clear now let me

1319.95 --> 1326.249
click on the more details to yeah let me

1321.509 --> 1330.57
just get this file focus open okay focus

1326.249 --> 1334.47
do different distances it doesn't give

1330.57 --> 1346.379
good unfortunately I would be into

1334.47 --> 1354.3890000000001
thinkin know what that is long exposure

1346.379 --> 1360.33
time one would okay isolating name

1354.389 --> 1367.58
sparkling 56 millimeters okay it's a

1360.33 --> 1371.639
nikuman dat camera been used interesting

1367.58 --> 1374.82
but if you look at the focus yeah you

1371.639 --> 1378.649
see clearly even from a different

1374.82 --> 1380.31
distance miss blurry there is clear but

1378.649 --> 1383.36
when they

1380.31 --> 1385.6499999999999
listen here now the thoughts moving

1383.36 --> 1393.33
which shows there's always going to be a

1385.65 --> 1395.94
limit of diffraction it's not mean yeah

1393.33 --> 1397.8899999999999
we're I'm gonna bring the target hard to

1395.94 --> 1400.939
look at it on your focusing abilities

1397.89 --> 1400.939
[Music]

1405.38 --> 1420.2
the Pens are on your what type of camera

1422.45 --> 1431.66
stock what kind of camera came the

1426.3 --> 1436.2
specifics is very important yeah okay

1431.66 --> 1440.95
physics I'm not even gonna try to me the

1436.2 --> 1442.55
Greek word knowledge of nature from

1440.95 --> 1446.3700000000001
[Music]

1442.55 --> 1449.54
could you zoom in as a richer the

1446.37 --> 1451.9799999999998
natural science that studies matter and

1449.54 --> 1459.75
what William could you zoom in a little

1451.98 --> 1464.19
because it's really small I don't come

1459.75 --> 1464.88
bringing it in that better yeah yeah

1464.19 --> 1475.29
much better

1464.88 --> 1483.1200000000001
oh dude that's too much cheese hey okay

1475.29 --> 1485.85
a little bigger Jeezy one more wrap it

1483.12 --> 1489.4399999999998
up no one more please you're scrolling

1485.85 --> 1489.4399999999998
it back against grating whisper ready

1496.549 --> 1504.179
if you look like snow on your thunder on

1500.219 --> 1509.509
both sides now my computer is really

1504.179 --> 1509.509
fast okay right

1526.09 --> 1532.29
okay natural signs at the branch of

1532.5 --> 1536.41
cones

1534.07 --> 1539.2
wait no need for spent when you go to

1536.41 --> 1543.66
finish in the coming of natural

1539.2 --> 1543.66
phenomena based on empirical evidence

1549.99 --> 1554.08
yeah

1551.35 --> 1557.05
can you please zoom in more because I

1554.08 --> 1571.3
can't even read it like this so and the

1557.05 --> 1584.02
audience definitely can't better yes

1571.3 --> 1587.2
hold it okay for nature the natural

1584.02 --> 1590.52
science that studies meta and his motion

1587.2 --> 1593.1100000000001
and behavior through space and time

1590.52 --> 1594.9
related entities of energy and force

1593.11 --> 1598.3
physics is one of the most fundamental

1594.9 --> 1599.6200000000001
scientific disciplines and its main goal

1598.3 --> 1603.85
is to understand how the universe

1599.62 --> 1609.37
behaves physics is one in two oldest

1603.85 --> 1612.25
academic disciplines and through its

1609.37 --> 1615.75
inclusion of astronomy perhaps the

1612.25 --> 1619.99
oldest over the last two millennia

1615.75 --> 1625.17
physics chemistry biology and certain

1619.99 --> 1630.18
branches of mathematics were part all we

1625.17 --> 1630.18
now that works on mathematics right babe

1635.37 --> 1641.5
that's already happened eleven some math

1637.96 --> 1645.3700000000001
unit yet but during the Scientific

1641.5 --> 1648.13
Revolution in the 17th century it is

1645.37 --> 1651.84
natural sciences emerged a unique

1648.13 --> 1655.5100000000002
research endeavors in the early life

1651.84 --> 1658.99
takes with many introduces disciplinary

1655.51 --> 1659.77
irresolute beast areas of research such

1658.99 --> 1664.08
as

1659.77 --> 1664.08
bio physics and quantum chemistry

1665.76 --> 1673.39
physics a lot of stuff that needs to be

1669.01 --> 1676.66
taking apart and boundaries of physics

1673.39 --> 1679.74
are not immediately define European

1676.66 --> 1683.38
physics often explain any fundamental

1679.74 --> 1686.91
mechanisms Nalepa other Sciences and

1683.38 --> 1691.3200000000002
suggest new avenues of research in

1686.91 --> 1703.0500000000002
active just mathematics and philosophy

1691.32 --> 1706.72
green aliens in physics often in Poland

1703.05 --> 1710.11
for example advances an understanding of

1706.72 --> 1711.73
electromagnetism and nuclear perfect led

1710.11 --> 1714.3999999999999
directly to development of new products

1711.73 --> 1717.13
that dramatically transform modern-day

1714.4 --> 1719.73
society such as television computers

1717.13 --> 1722.2
domestic appliances and nuclear weapons

1719.73 --> 1725.07
advances in thermodynamics led to

1722.2 --> 1728.44
development of industrialization and

1725.07 --> 1734.59
advances in mechanics inspired the

1728.44 --> 1738.94
development of calculus yep mechanical

1734.59 --> 1741.2099999999998
thinking that's true there is quite a

1738.94 --> 1741.21
blow

1742.02 --> 1747.8799999999999
yeah physics has a history mazing hobby

1745.72 --> 1765.75
if people came to associate mathematics

1747.88 --> 1765.75
of everything not as relevant okay

1771.15 --> 1774.239
[Music]

1776.7 --> 1784.0
without the ability of an image device

1779.68 --> 1786.22
to separate ITC as distinct what means

1784.0 --> 1790.18
of an object that are located and a

1786.22 --> 1792.28
small angular distance it is the optical

1790.18 --> 1794.0800000000002
instrument to separate faraway objects

1792.28 --> 1796.42
that are close to

1794.08 --> 1799.35
into individual images the term

1796.42 --> 1802.0
resolution or minimum resolve resolvable

1799.35 --> 1807.78
distance is the minimum distance between

1802.0 --> 1810.79
the distinguish objects in an image

1807.78 --> 1815.23
although the term is Lucy used by many

1810.79 --> 1818.95
users of Markus codes you describe scrub

1815.23 --> 1822.97
resolving power in scientific analysis

1818.95 --> 1825.19
in general the term resolution is used

1822.97 --> 1827.95
to describe the precision with which an

1825.19 --> 1838.75
instrument modes an image or spectrum in

1827.95 --> 1841.3300000000002
the specimen or sample under study is a

1838.75 --> 1850.39
description of random errors a measure

1841.33 --> 1863.47
of the physical three precise random

1850.39 --> 1869.26
errors that just speaks a lot okay the

1863.47 --> 1872.07
image being absolute elation can be

1869.26 --> 1874.96
limited either bar aberration or bar

1872.07 --> 1877.33
distraction causing blurring of the

1874.96 --> 1880.95
image okay now we speak a lot about

1877.33 --> 1896.35
diffraction we don't speak much about I

1880.95 --> 1899.3500000000001
do a variation in optics aberration is a

1896.35 --> 1902.53
property of optical systems such as

1899.35 --> 1906.4199999999998
lenses their causes lot to be spread out

1902.53 --> 1909.31
over some water then focused to a point

1906.42 --> 1911.89
aberrations caused the image formed by

1909.31 --> 1913.33
lens to be blurred or distorted with the

1911.89 --> 1916.75
nature of draining on the top of

1913.33 --> 1919.9299999999998
aberration aberration can be defined and

1916.75 --> 1923.11
a departure from the performance of an

1919.93 --> 1927.63
optical system from the prediction of

1923.11 --> 1933.039
our axial objects

1927.63 --> 1935.5590000000002
yeah I'll get to that now in an imaging

1933.039 --> 1938.59
system it occurs when lot from one point

1935.559 --> 1940.84
of an object does not converge into or

1938.59 --> 1943.019
does not converge from a single point of

1940.84 --> 1946.559
the transmission river system

1943.019 --> 1950.95
aberrations occur because of the simple

1946.559 --> 1952.6299999999999
corrects your theory is not a completely

1950.95 --> 1956.6490000000001
accurate model of the effect of an

1952.63 --> 1960.3300000000002
optical system on light rather than due

1956.649 --> 1963.639
to flaws in the optical elements an

1960.33 --> 1966.1
image forming or ecosystem with

1963.639 --> 1969.4599999999998
aberration will produce an image which

1966.1 --> 1972.1899999999998
is not sure makers of optical elements

1969.46 --> 1975.039
need to correct optical systems to

1972.19 --> 1977.2
compensate or aberration and I was

1975.039 --> 1978.57
saying earlier too because your glasses

1977.2 --> 1983.44
and your mirrors

1978.57 --> 1988.3799999999999
awesome great aberration yeah things

1983.44 --> 1988.38
need to be tuned it's obvious but really

1988.679 --> 1993.6100000000001
I've been pushing in this case as to

1991.51 --> 1996.309
creation of what it's supposed to be

1993.61 --> 2004.1689999999999
doing aberration can be analyzed with

1996.309 --> 2008.19
the techniques of geometric for articles

2004.169 --> 2010.5590000000002
on reflection refraction and caustics

2008.19 --> 2016.6490000000001
discussed the general features on

2010.559 --> 2019.5
reflected and refracted rays soul out

2016.649 --> 2022.049
there if you people want to study making

2019.5 --> 2025.049
going to those options there and they

2022.049 --> 2029.46
get more information on how the laws and

2025.049 --> 2031.83
your lenses and your perfect outcome of

2029.46 --> 2037.559
the picture will stay vaunted you then

2031.83 --> 2042.48
doesn't want to just yeah it's good

2037.559 --> 2045.029
stuff it's a lot of data to look through

2042.48 --> 2047.58
but yeah but just as a people that

2045.029 --> 2051.379
specialize in this kind of thing in to

2047.58 --> 2051.379
say let's look at reflection

2058.06 --> 2064.7
she is a chain reaction of a white front

2061.37 --> 2068.0
at an interface between two different

2064.7 --> 2071.3799999999997
media so that the wave front returns

2068.0 --> 2075.14
into the medium from which it originated

2071.38 --> 2079.79
common examples include reflection of

2075.14 --> 2082.3399999999997
lot fan and water waves the law of

2079.79 --> 2084.92
reflection says that for spectacular

2082.34 --> 2090.86
reflection the angle at which the wave

2084.92 --> 2094.69
is incident on the surface equals the

2090.86 --> 2101.27
angular it is replace it an exhibit

2094.69 --> 2103.43
exhibit a chill air play stop bringing

2101.27 --> 2107.24
our prediction for presenting stop at

2103.43 --> 2116.0299999999997
curs stop it is used in sonar the

2107.24 --> 2118.5499999999997
geology okay not presenting anymore and

2116.03 --> 2121.63
you're breaking up it's okay thanks for

2118.55 --> 2121.63
your voice to come

2136.59 --> 2148.2000000000003
oh okay all right

2144.9 --> 2148.77
maybe yes computer troubles but anyway

2148.2 --> 2152.1
yeah

2148.77 --> 2157.1
Travis dropped and now William has

2152.1 --> 2159.33
dropped also was in one hand it was

2157.1 --> 2160.71
absolutely fascinating when he's dealing

2159.33 --> 2164.5
with her and the other hand it's just

2160.71 --> 2167.579
such a terrible connection yeah me yes

2164.5 --> 2167.579
[Music]

2171.75 --> 2176.119
[Music]

2180.23 --> 2213.96
yeah you've got worse she's dead travis

2193.59 --> 2227.03
has at times all right you're gonna go

2213.96 --> 2230.1
for it again no good well present

2227.03 --> 2233.94
presenting is good yeah if your sound

2230.1 --> 2236.91
sucks I could read it if you just keep

2233.94 --> 2240.03
it presented right reflection in physics

2236.91 --> 2245.0099999999998
reflection is the change in direction of

2240.03 --> 2247.6800000000003
a wave front at an interface between two

2245.01 --> 2250.7700000000004
different media so that the wave front

2247.68 --> 2253.5
returns into the medium from which it

2250.77 --> 2255.63
originated common examples include a

2253.5 --> 2258.99
reflection of light sound and water

2255.63 --> 2262.86
waves the law of reflection says that

2258.99 --> 2266.16
for specular reflection the angle at

2262.86 --> 2269.01
which the wave is incident on the

2266.16 --> 2270.1299999999997
surface equals the angle at which it is

2269.01 --> 2274.42
reflected

2270.13 --> 2277.059
mirrors exhibit specular reflection in

2274.42 --> 2280.119
acoustics reflection causes echoes and

2277.059 --> 2282.63
is used in sonar in geology it is

2280.119 --> 2285.4900000000002
important in the study of seismic waves

2282.63 --> 2287.92
reflection is observed with surface

2285.49 --> 2290.43
waves in bodies of water reflection is

2287.92 --> 2296.17
observed with many types of

2290.43 --> 2296.89
electromagnetic wave waves the nobody

2296.17 --> 2301.9
estimates

2296.89 --> 2305.109
besides visual light reflection of VHF

2301.9 --> 2307.38
and higher frequencies is important for

2305.109 --> 2310.5989999999997
radio transmission and for Ray there and

2307.38 --> 2313.359
even x-ray and gamma rays can be

2310.599 --> 2318.3900000000003
reflected at shallow angles with special

2313.359 --> 2323.109
grazing mirrors right everything

2318.39 --> 2336.819
reflections reflections are used and a

2323.109 --> 2343.089
lot of connection of light which is a

2336.819 --> 2345.39
very very interesting topic yes but if

2343.089 --> 2350.17
you look in the page or spectrum of

2345.39 --> 2353.2889999999998
reflection let's not read this part out

2350.17 --> 2355.089
it's way too technical and look at it

2353.289 --> 2357.7200000000003
for a moment see if I see something

2355.089 --> 2357.72
interesting

2372.32 --> 2378.57
alright ok they talked about that during

2376.53 --> 2382.4900000000002
a reflection some of the light is

2378.57 --> 2385.8500000000004
refracted it's basically not perfectly

2382.49 --> 2391.5899999999997
reflective and that causes refraction

2385.85 --> 2393.45
pharisee interesting you see so in a lot

2391.59 --> 2395.82
of things once you start to understand

2393.45 --> 2397.3199999999997
all of these and look into these thing

2395.82 --> 2400.9100000000003
just not to realize that what you're

2397.32 --> 2400.9100000000003
seeing is not what you think you see

2403.16 --> 2410.54
well it's interesting to know that

2405.86 --> 2414.6200000000003
refraction takes place with reflection

2410.54 --> 2416.55
it it also takes place in animals

2414.62 --> 2419.31
reflection refraction

2416.55 --> 2422.3700000000003
it's a apparent in both forms when the

2419.31 --> 2424.47
lenses and in the mirror so right it's

2422.37 --> 2428.0099999999998
origin the credible yahwah but with

2424.47 --> 2431.2799999999997
modern modern photography technology

2428.01 --> 2434.88
they've improved they minimized the

2431.28 --> 2440.63
refraction to absolute insignificant

2434.88 --> 2455.06
level so but that used to be pretty bad

2440.63 --> 2455.06
get out a rock just half a page right

2469.98 --> 2481.41
hmm wow man there is so much - that

2477.45 --> 2483.95
would be impatient is there so many

2481.41 --> 2489.39
mechanisms in this stuff it's incredible

2483.95 --> 2497.7599999999998
it really is like I'm not a whole

2489.39 --> 2500.7
different technology and it explains

2497.76 --> 2503.6000000000004
them the way they use tunnels how we

2500.7 --> 2508.9399999999996
feel of foraging tunnels for waves

2503.6 --> 2511.95
fascinating now if you think about it

2508.94 --> 2516.03
all of this a lot of these things are

2511.95 --> 2519.39
referred to earth waves now the plant is

2516.03 --> 2522.75
a wave and what a lot of people don't

2519.39 --> 2525.359
understand at lot in order for it to be

2522.75 --> 2532.859
a wave lot has to run on a frequency of

2525.359 --> 2536.13
some kind right now a lot of the things

2532.859 --> 2538.3199999999997
of what I put up I mean a lot of what we

2536.13 --> 2539.9700000000003
see how do we even know what they say

2538.32 --> 2543.7400000000002
that it is what they saying is because

2539.97 --> 2546.93
if it's a wave if light is a wave

2543.74 --> 2549.14
now how doing how can we be certain of

2546.93 --> 2556.2
the source I mean it's not really a wave

2549.14 --> 2562.1
it's it behaves like a wave but it isn't

2556.2 --> 2566.91
a way it's not particles wave yeah

2562.1 --> 2569.3399999999997
suggest like a ripple yeah effect but

2566.91 --> 2571.5299999999997
life is now in my opinion is not photons

2569.34 --> 2578.1600000000003
it's basically an art it's just beams

2571.53 --> 2582.48
and they can disperse like like waves I

2578.16 --> 2591.17
guess but I don't see them literally as

2582.48 --> 2591.17
waves now without the loss of reflection

2597.56 --> 2606.15
and this is also pretty heavy on a

2602.369 --> 2607.29
morning stomach but yeah it's

2606.15 --> 2611.76
interesting

2607.29 --> 2613.5
oh man I feel like I'm arriving at

2611.76 --> 2614.55
school and it's like oh [ __ ] this is

2613.5 --> 2657.42
difficult

2614.55 --> 2659.88
I mean study now but there was some

2657.42 --> 2667.349
really production being described there

2659.88 --> 2670.82
I was talking about the influence of

2667.349 --> 2676.02
light on the electrons of matter others

2670.82 --> 2678.78
anything without me scroll back I want

2676.02 --> 2687.089
to see it the fraction is also pretty

2678.78 --> 2692.19
interesting so yeah go either way

2687.089 --> 2695.86
we have about 15 more minutes

2692.19 --> 2695.86
[Music]

2703.42 --> 2707.139
[Music]

2717.74 --> 2729.2599999999998
oh yeah just good write down something

2727.22 --> 2732.1
gonna be a while I'm waiting for that

2729.26 --> 2732.1000000000004
bird

2735.22 --> 2743.35
you're breaking up and your internet

2737.99 --> 2743.35
connection is of okay better

2761.96 --> 2765.13
[Music]

2774.95 --> 2785.73
right so yeah dude I think I'm gonna cut

2782.1 --> 2793.3199999999997
you off for a moment I know kind of on a

2785.73 --> 2802.44
roll but yeah let's let's talk about

2793.32 --> 2818.7000000000003
stuff now definitely look in this after

2802.44 --> 2822.15
the show topic right so yeah

2818.7 --> 2826.23
anybody see my appearance on that I'm

2822.15 --> 2829.71
Tim I'm Tim's hangout yesterday I told

2826.23 --> 2832.98
you a super ass was there too and some

2829.71 --> 2833.7
other guy you know I don't care but it

2832.98 --> 2840.09
was hilarious

2833.7 --> 2842.7
I was basically well teach trolling him

2840.09 --> 2845.3900000000003
in chat and then he's a little why don't

2842.7 --> 2849.7799999999997
you come on wouldn't you go on just like

2845.39 --> 2851.22
and then I came on anyway and then I did

2849.78 --> 2855.8
pretty much the same thing on the

2851.22 --> 2859.7999999999997
hangout was hilarious their total denial

2855.8 --> 2864.2400000000002
just hand way of dismissing everything I

2859.8 --> 2866.4300000000003
said not even giving feedback that they

2864.24 --> 2870.0299999999997
actually understand what I was talking

2866.43 --> 2871.6499999999996
about you know it's all based on things

2870.03 --> 2875.1600000000003
you can basically demonstrate to

2871.65 --> 2878.4
yourself and optical sciences but ya

2875.16 --> 2881.19
know it's all ridiculous and it's weird

2878.4 --> 2886.08
fantasies about optics about how it

2881.19 --> 2889.98
actually works and so silly that we

2886.08 --> 2893.7599999999998
latch on to very elaborate structured

2889.98 --> 2895.56
proven things that don't coincide with

2893.76 --> 2897.2700000000004
the globe because yeah why would you

2895.56 --> 2898.71
stick to anything that doesn't coincide

2897.27 --> 2903.37
with the good

2898.71 --> 2908.4700000000003
let's can't do that not if your glow

2903.37 --> 2910.39
burn anyway oh yeah check it out it was

2908.47 --> 2911.2599999999998
kind of funny I think I popped in like

2910.39 --> 2917.92
halfway there

2911.26 --> 2926.6200000000003
and I was a bit bored I guess what was

2917.92 --> 2936.64
funny everybody's all frustrated with

2926.62 --> 2939.97
the money it is cold and clouded so I

2936.64 --> 2943.47
guess I agree in this case but I feel

2939.97 --> 2947.62
good I had a call with my healer again

2943.47 --> 2952.12
because of situations and that helps a

2947.62 --> 2954.25
lot every freaking time so I feel pretty

2952.12 --> 2962.5
good despite it being Monday and grey

2954.25 --> 2964.63
and cold anyway you know what I think

2962.5 --> 2972.52
I'm gonna round out the show a bit early

2964.63 --> 2977.65
today because yeah Nathan is already

2972.52 --> 2980.02
underway on his show and I kind of am

2977.65 --> 2982.2400000000002
interesting in what they're doing right

2980.02 --> 2984.33
now so I think I'm gonna round out the

2982.24 --> 2987.43
show for now thank you

2984.33 --> 2991.21
Travis for popping by and thank you

2987.43 --> 2994.93
William mcfreak MC a lot for the

2991.21 --> 2997.96
presentation although I would absolutely

2994.93 --> 3001.1099999999997
recommend you build a good video with

2997.96 --> 3002.94
clear recording and everything because

3001.11 --> 3004.35
yeah when your son is breaking up when

3002.94 --> 3007.83
you're reading things and explaining

3004.35 --> 3012.06
things that is just yeah did your

3007.83 --> 3013.5299999999997
message at loss so it's it's a waste you

3012.06 --> 3016.14
really need to make a good video about

3013.53 --> 3018.75
this and then put that out and I'll play

3016.14 --> 3021.81
it on my show from beginning to end it's

3018.75 --> 3025.47
really good check it out first so yeah I

3021.81 --> 3029.31
hope you're gonna do that and then I am

3025.47 --> 3030.2999999999997
gonna run out the show right now thanks

3029.31 --> 3031.6
everyone

3030.3 --> 3036.34
okay come

3031.6 --> 3039.0
yeah a lot of people also Adam II can

3036.34 --> 3041.56
say all in fields yeah

3039.0 --> 3047.11
I've sent you those links if you want to

3041.56 --> 3049.57
add them before your upload yes right 1

3047.11 --> 3051.94
2 3 4 links and all those starts give

3049.57 --> 3056.0800000000004
you all the additional links highlighted

3051.94 --> 3062.65
in blue ok I'll put them in chat right

3056.08 --> 3067.2
now every disc really criterion limits

3062.65 --> 3073.9300000000003
of resolution and angular resolution

3067.2 --> 3079.21
indeed I'm sure people have found that

3073.93 --> 3081.2799999999997
some interesting reading yes so I put

3079.21 --> 3083.44
all your links in chat this is pretty

3081.28 --> 3086.05
much what we were going through if you

3083.44 --> 3093.9700000000003
want to take a look at yourself you can

3086.05 --> 3100.96
do it using this so yeah thanks everyone

3093.97 --> 3103.06
for coming and yeah I am going to go to

3100.96 --> 3106.63
the debates right after this please

3103.06 --> 3109.84
don't forget to subscribe to my channel

3106.63 --> 3111.25
if you haven't already and if you are

3109.84 --> 3113.05
please check if you haven't been

3111.25 --> 3117.58
unsubscribed for some reasons it seems

3113.05 --> 3121.48
to happen a lot and yeah I will see you

3117.58 --> 3121.99
tomorrow same time same place on the

3121.48 --> 3125.59
flat earth

3121.99 --> 3130.35
early-bird number 13 my lucky number so

3125.59 --> 3130.3500000000004
in the meantime keep it flat
