110.0 --> 115.64
right weather

111.92 --> 115.64
today is really

115.88 --> 121.36
mixed like right now there's a bit of

118.2 --> 124.64
nice blue sky over

121.36 --> 127.96
but like half an hour ago it was like

124.64 --> 127.96
raining really hard

128.119 --> 133.64
so whe just goes back and forth oh seems

131.64 --> 135.83999999999997
like there's a big cloud coming over

133.64 --> 135.83999999999997
right

138.84 --> 147.04
now right but there is some nice blue

141.72 --> 147.04
sky out there with some sun

150.68 --> 153.08
bit of

153.16 --> 157.599
wind but yeah the weather is kind of

155.68 --> 160.44
unpredictable

157.599 --> 163.28
overall never really know

160.44 --> 166.04
what's one moment it's just nice and

163.28 --> 169.76
sunny and the other one and the other

166.04 --> 173.48
moment it's yeah hard

169.76 --> 175.28
rain so if I'm going to go out today I'm

173.48 --> 178.28
probably going to take my umbrella with

175.28 --> 178.28
me

181.32 --> 187.319
[Music]

184.4 --> 189.519
anyway hello borders boy first in chat

187.319 --> 195.51899999999998
dupons good to see

189.519 --> 195.519
you it is Friday the 19th of April

202.09 --> 205.28900000000002
[Applause]

206.44 --> 216.4
2024 temperature is 10Â° Celsius

211.959 --> 220.36
H it says here it's going to be mostly

216.4 --> 220.36
rainy and tomorrow as

220.64 --> 228.92
well 76% humidity 56%

226.68 --> 234.239
precipitation

228.92 --> 234.23899999999998
yeah so not great the weather but oh

234.56 --> 240.04
well hey Gary Fe good to see you

246.04 --> 252.0
right

248.28 --> 255.0
so how you guys doing I'm doing way

252.0 --> 258.72
better than yesterday I feel much more

255.0 --> 258.72
rested like a lot

259.0 --> 267.919
more yesterday I just felt like this

263.96 --> 271.71999999999997
tiredness mental fatigue and I don't

267.919 --> 271.71999999999997
have that today I just feel a lot better

271.8 --> 278.16
better so that's great I was really kind

275.88 --> 279.84
of disappointed yesterday of yeah

278.16 --> 282.84000000000003
shutting the show

279.84 --> 282.84
down

283.16 --> 288.44
after what was it a little over two

288.56 --> 292.759
hours when it was just like it was just

291.24 --> 295.16
getting

292.759 --> 298.0
good I was

295.16 --> 303.8
basically uh

298.0 --> 303.8
discussing what is appar L called obers

309.8 --> 314.479
Paradox didn't realize that that was the

312.36 --> 316.199
name of it but yeah that was basically

314.479 --> 317.68
the discussion of yesterday and it's an

316.199 --> 320.96000000000004
interesting

317.68 --> 324.16
discussion right but yeah I figured out

320.96 --> 324.15999999999997
like how

324.52 --> 330.88
to yeah my roommates wanted to use the

327.8 --> 333.0
Wi-Fi and I didn't know what to do but I

330.88 --> 336.08
can basically just keep the show going

333.0 --> 338.44
and just press the reset button and that

336.08 --> 339.56
should fix it if if that were to happen

338.44 --> 344.88
again

339.56 --> 348.12
so I won't have to like shut down the

344.88 --> 350.639
show in case something like that happens

348.12 --> 356.16
again somewhere in the next one and a

350.639 --> 358.44
half week or God forbid more right but

356.16 --> 360.24
another issue remains and that is that

358.44 --> 365.44
there is a limited data

360.24 --> 368.84000000000003
I haven't up the data since two days

365.44 --> 373.44
ago so what could potentially happen is

368.84 --> 376.23999999999995
that suddenly the show just

373.44 --> 378.71999999999997
stops and that's not because my internet

376.24 --> 381.319
connection got

378.72 --> 384.52000000000004
disconnected because of the usual issues

381.319 --> 388.24
but because the data has run out and if

384.52 --> 391.15999999999997
that happens then yeah then you

388.24 --> 393.199
know like I could up it but that will

391.16 --> 396.0
probably take

393.199 --> 398.40000000000003
like some time so I wouldn't be able to

396.0 --> 400.84
like continue the show

398.4 --> 403.88
immediately just so you know if the show

400.84 --> 405.71999999999997
suddenly discontinues suddenly Cuts cut

403.88 --> 407.8
off it's because I've run out of data I

405.72 --> 410.72
don't know if if that's going to happen

407.8 --> 413.96000000000004
because I don't really know how much

410.72 --> 417.0
data streaming like this even spends I

413.96 --> 417.0
don't really have a good

417.12 --> 422.479
oversight so I will definitely try to

420.4 --> 424.4
check the next

422.479 --> 426.919
time

424.4 --> 430.15999999999997
but chances are that I'll just be able

426.919 --> 434.12
to do a full on stream without any

430.16 --> 434.12
problem right so

435.039 --> 441.36
anyway hey Amanda Yung good to see

438.0 --> 441.36
you how you

443.879 --> 448.879
doing got some minty here

450.4 --> 455.96
got a Tura coffee on standby and

453.28 --> 455.96
Illuminati

456.599 --> 462.57
KAS that I will put in the oven

459.34 --> 462.57
[Music]

466.599 --> 471.52
later good so far all right good to hear

470.0 --> 476.599
glad you're doing

471.52 --> 476.599
great I'm doing way better myself

481.28 --> 488.35999999999996
overall yesterday was a bit better had a

484.12 --> 491.68
bit of an adventure trying to

488.36 --> 495.28000000000003
uh find a certain place and I just like

491.68 --> 497.8
I had to go there on the bike but I like

495.28 --> 500.52
continually took the wrong took wrong

497.8 --> 503.44
turn so I yeah I didn't make it in time

500.52 --> 504.639
I have to try that again I might try

503.44 --> 507.44
again

504.639 --> 511.44
later

507.44 --> 511.44
today but I mean with this weather

514.32 --> 518.9190000000001
there kind of

516.24 --> 521.519
sucks I was originally planning to do it

518.919 --> 524.36
today early but then like I just slept

521.519 --> 526.88
really well how's the new bike going

524.36 --> 526.88
yeah pretty

528.2 --> 534.76
good I have some weird gear issue that

531.6 --> 536.8000000000001
that I'll have to like check up

534.76 --> 539.959
with with

536.8 --> 543.1999999999999
that but I mean it it works works just

539.959 --> 548.279
fine the way it is so yeah very glad

543.2 --> 548.279
with the new bike the new secondhand

566.36 --> 571.36
bike uh what was I doing yesterday

574.76 --> 579.04
how many hours of sleep do I usually

579.959 --> 583.3599999999999
have around

586.2 --> 594.399
8 that's ideal for me and like after

590.32 --> 594.399
more hours I just like get

598.16 --> 605.24
Restless don't pay to fix the gear

601.24 --> 609.8
issue well probably no don't

605.24 --> 611.8
really it's look I got that bike there

609.8 --> 615.24
they just have to like kind of adjust it

611.8 --> 615.24
I don't think I have to pay for

617.2 --> 621.9590000000001
that don't worry about it

635.399 --> 641.279
right but uh yeah what was I doing

645.839 --> 650.839
yesterday watching some infow Wars was

651.88 --> 657.6
not not

654.68 --> 661.0
prly interesting oh yeah I heard that

657.6 --> 663.839
apparently a few days ago

661.0 --> 666.24
big volcano eruption happened in

663.839 --> 669.0790000000001
Indonesia some pretty spectacular

666.24 --> 669.0790000000001
footage of it as

676.2 --> 683.839
well on uh one of the uh Easter

681.48 --> 686.48
Islands Eastern

683.839 --> 690.0790000000001
Islands east of like the

686.48 --> 691.88
main Big Island

690.079 --> 694.079
so that

691.88 --> 698.4399999999999
happened I but I mean you could like

694.079 --> 701.4799999999999
really see like the Ashes coming out of

698.44 --> 704.2790000000001
it and like electricity like that's

701.48 --> 707.12
really spectacular to see

704.279 --> 709.56
that like constant electricity Just

707.12 --> 714.639
Happening from the friction and

709.56 --> 714.6389999999999
everything it's really nothing like it

719.72 --> 726.12
let's see what else is oh Benjamin of

726.279 --> 732.279
course it's just a nice and amicable

729.16 --> 736.68
stream with some good letters and

732.279 --> 736.68
everything that was great

777.0 --> 782.839
sa my right no no na on my bike

780.36 --> 782.839
definitely

785.199 --> 789.399
not now I

787.32 --> 794.839
just the

789.399 --> 797.44
route went through like a a part of your

794.839 --> 800.639
track that had been like there's been a

797.44 --> 803.0
lot of construction there so when I had

800.639 --> 805.279
to go through it now like I didn't I

803.0 --> 808.399
barely recognized it from the last time

805.279 --> 812.04
I went there so it was all just a bit

808.399 --> 814.639
disorienting and but I figured like I

812.04 --> 818.7199999999999
basically went all the

814.639 --> 822.16
wrong the wrong routes just so that now

818.72 --> 824.1990000000001
I know what the right route is like I

822.16 --> 825.8
was already going to be late so I but I

824.199 --> 828.92
was just like I'm going to keep going

825.8 --> 832.5999999999999
until I find it so that now if I have to

828.92 --> 834.759
go there I can just go there straight

832.6 --> 839.9590000000001
without getting

834.759 --> 839.9590000000001
lost so I know the route now

842.04 --> 847.079
all right everything should be fine I

843.6 --> 848.9590000000001
just don't really want to go out in well

847.079 --> 851.6389999999999
in this type of

848.959 --> 855.88
weather get super

851.639 --> 855.88
soaked because it's already raining

862.88 --> 868.959
again pay for the wireless internet

865.279 --> 868.959
connection no

874.72 --> 880.36
now I'm just using the temporary

878.36 --> 885.48
replacement

880.36 --> 885.48
internet which is like a dumo they call

886.32 --> 891.0400000000001
it and I got it Jack directly in my

888.92 --> 893.8
computer so I don't have to interface

891.04 --> 897.16
with it through the wireless card which

893.8 --> 899.3599999999999
is like I don't like it I don't like

897.16 --> 900.759
doing that I mean I got everything wired

899.36 --> 904.12
for a good reason

900.759 --> 907.24
because like

904.12 --> 910.36
WiFi just makes me kind of

907.24 --> 915.0790000000001
sick but

910.36 --> 918.16
just uh the back and forth to the main

915.079 --> 920.8389999999999
station which goes through 4G system is

918.16 --> 923.6
doable oh my god

920.839 --> 926.9200000000001
really freaking cat just comes walking

923.6 --> 930.9590000000001
in like he [Â __Â ] owns the place and he

926.92 --> 930.959
doesn't hold on guys I'm going to

932.0 --> 934.56
be right

957.92 --> 961.959
back for

1012.92 --> 1018.88
right I just use the opportunity

1015.72 --> 1020.839
to turn on my coffee and put the

1018.88 --> 1022.0
Illuminati croissant in the oven so I'm

1020.839 --> 1026.839
going to get that

1022.0 --> 1026.839
early I am really hungry I woke up very

1032.12 --> 1036.4799999999998
hungry you said you had temporary wir

1034.839 --> 1038.9589999999998
this internet connection because of the

1036.48 --> 1040.6
cable yeah but that's be no I don't have

1038.959 --> 1042.439
a cat it's a neighbor's cat it was

1040.6 --> 1046.0
always just trying to get in

1042.439 --> 1049.679
here but no I didn't buy temporary

1046.0 --> 1051.16
Wireless I got it from the

1049.679 --> 1054.44
internet

1051.16 --> 1057.6000000000001
company because they're supposed to

1054.44 --> 1061.3200000000002
provide and they can't so they gave us

1057.6 --> 1064.24
this temporary internet thing as a

1061.32 --> 1064.24
replacement

1067.4 --> 1073.96
duper right but it has it works in a way

1071.6 --> 1076.32
that there's a limited amount of data it

1073.96 --> 1079.28
has and I have to up

1076.32 --> 1083.6399999999999
it through a phone call and I don't

1079.28 --> 1083.6399999999999
exactly know how much I actually

1083.919 --> 1092.5590000000002
expand and I do know that doing YouTube

1087.919 --> 1094.8400000000001
live streaming expends a lot of data it

1092.559 --> 1094.84
just

1102.08 --> 1108.32
does but I don't know exactly how much

1105.08 --> 1110.3999999999999
so it's it's basically kind of like a

1108.32 --> 1114.2
what f work

1110.4 --> 1117.3200000000002
here it could potentially get cut off or

1114.2 --> 1120.32
who knows maybe that was not the case at

1117.32 --> 1121.08
all and maybe it could like technically

1120.32 --> 1125.6
go

1121.08 --> 1125.6
on the entire weekend without an

1127.159 --> 1133.6000000000001
issue did I not ask about yeah I did ask

1130.4 --> 1137.0800000000002
that they the last time I called they

1133.6 --> 1140.08
didn't they couldn't access it for some

1137.08 --> 1140.08
reason

1140.32 --> 1144.28
they couldn't tell I don't know

1150.2 --> 1157.799
why right I just upped it two days ago

1154.36 --> 1157.799
before I was going to start the

1158.48 --> 1162.76
show that's it

1169.039 --> 1173.36
right but I'm going to keep going

1176.679 --> 1181.48
and just to see how far I can go with

1183.919 --> 1188.919
it and then up it at least

1189.0 --> 1193.96
tomorrow because they're not you can't

1191.64 --> 1197.159
reach them over the phone on Sunday

1193.96 --> 1199.6000000000001
don't want to be cut out from internet

1197.159 --> 1202.48
entirely on Sunday if that happens to be

1199.6 --> 1205.12
the moment where it where I run out

1202.48 --> 1208.08
anyway this is not exactly a riveting

1205.12 --> 1209.799
subject to talk about but whatever it

1208.08 --> 1213.32
keeps you updated on how this is going

1209.799 --> 1213.32
to work for the coming

1214.08 --> 1221.48
period potentially coming two weeks or

1218.24 --> 1222.44
more at least not one one and a half

1221.48 --> 1225.76
week from

1222.44 --> 1229.72
now but hey I'm glad I'm able to stream

1225.76 --> 1229.72
at least right that's something

1254.28 --> 1260.6
right right I was watching a kind of an

1256.84 --> 1260.6
interesting video before this

1287.52 --> 1291.559
weird for

1318.72 --> 1320.919
hold

1322.54 --> 1325.599
[Applause]

1329.05 --> 1335.589
[Music]

1347.52 --> 1351.48

1387.36 --> 1392.12

1396.84 --> 1402.9189999999999
weirds

1399.159 --> 1408.6000000000001
God maybe you watch the wrong stream or

1402.919 --> 1408.6000000000001
something I don't know it's very strange

1422.36 --> 1429.8799999999999
right anyway good to have so many of you

1424.44 --> 1429.88
here please don't forget to Rogan it up

1447.799 --> 1451.9189999999999
right as I was saying I was watching

1450.12 --> 1454.9189999999999
interesting little

1451.919 --> 1454.919
video

1461.0 --> 1467.76
from from John Thor about The Shining

1464.76 --> 1470.36
reading in between the lines was an

1467.76 --> 1470.36
interesting video

1471.84 --> 1479.0
kind of funny to hear like a segment of

1475.08 --> 1481.12
Greg Reese video in there as well it's

1479.0 --> 1485.24
really funny hearing like Greg ree in

1481.12 --> 1489.12
between now Flat Earth videos and all

1485.24 --> 1492.52
that but yeah that was interesting

1489.12 --> 1494.4399999999998
very detailed look on it like I never

1492.52 --> 1497.72
really got too much into the whole

1494.44 --> 1500.88
shining thing I knew it had to do with

1497.72 --> 1500.88
like the moonlight landing

1501.84 --> 1509.52
and it's just I never really saw it too

1506.0 --> 1512.12
much in that maybe I was just not

1509.52 --> 1512.12
interested

1512.36 --> 1518.36
enough but yeah people do make some

1514.88 --> 1518.3600000000001
interesting analyses about

1522.0 --> 1527.72
it watched you right

1531.76 --> 1534.64
very strange

1544.24 --> 1548.76
then maybe somebody like tried to report

1547.039 --> 1553.039
you or something I don't

1548.76 --> 1553.039
know very odd

1587.279 --> 1592.48
right anyway

1589.32 --> 1596.4399999999998
things seem to be working just

1592.48 --> 1596.44
fine sun is back

1616.08 --> 1620.6399999999999
again I have finished watching Star Wars

1619.08 --> 1624.72
the

1620.64 --> 1626.5200000000002
Old the the original Ser the original

1624.72 --> 1629.84
movie

1626.52 --> 1632.44
series then like immediately continue

1629.84 --> 1634.039
like with the the

1632.44 --> 1635.6000000000001
sequels

1634.039 --> 1639.679
but

1635.6 --> 1645.799
man I mean the prequels really fit into

1639.679 --> 1645.799
it way better than the sequels do I

1646.12 --> 1654.1589999999999
mean sequels got some really good

1649.64 --> 1656.0
spectacular views and all that but just

1654.159 --> 1662.2
like the

1656.0 --> 1662.2
story of it I didn't get that far but I

1664.12 --> 1668.6
mean it just doesn't fit in

1674.679 --> 1681.799
it I really see now like like it's kind

1678.519 --> 1684.88
of funny because I'm like reanalyzing it

1681.799 --> 1686.72
and the prequels are really not that bad

1684.88 --> 1690.1200000000001
they really are they're really not that

1686.72 --> 1693.799
bad well maybe Jor J Banks is of course

1690.12 --> 1695.6399999999999
very annoying but other than that it's

1693.799 --> 1698.24
really not that bad at all it really

1695.64 --> 1703.44
does kind of

1698.24 --> 1703.44
fit but the sequels is

1703.679 --> 1712.0
just it's off in a way

1708.279 --> 1712.0
like the story is

1712.32 --> 1716.9189999999999
just something weird about it and like

1714.96 --> 1719.519
this first order thing like where the

1716.919 --> 1722.72
hell did that come

1719.519 --> 1725.88
from like why isn't there

1722.72 --> 1729.1200000000001
more detail on this supposed first order

1725.88 --> 1732.1200000000001
how that works and like are

1729.12 --> 1734.5189999999998
they conditioning soldiers from birth

1732.12 --> 1734.5189999999998
all of a

1734.799 --> 1742.2
sudden right it it's like the writing

1737.399 --> 1745.08
could have been better like more well

1742.2 --> 1749.799
through maybe they they should have like

1745.08 --> 1753.32
put a movie in between there to really

1749.799 --> 1753.32
explain the the

1754.399 --> 1761.9599999999998
post original movies transition of like

1757.919 --> 1765.7990000000002
how things changed because it's

1761.96 --> 1767.8400000000001
like they basically just try to put it

1765.799 --> 1771.24
right back where they were originally

1767.84 --> 1774.559
and just it just it's off it's weird it

1771.24 --> 1774.559
it really stands out to

1786.399 --> 1791.4799999999998
me I think it does act like it's

1789.2 --> 1795.3600000000001
especially like the the transition like

1791.48 --> 1797.88
with the first one is just it's just

1795.36 --> 1799.9189999999999
weird I think it gets a little better

1797.88 --> 1804.279
with with the second one but uh yeah

1799.919 --> 1804.279
anyway I'm just continue watching

1816.679 --> 1821.2
that

1818.64 --> 1824.24
H

1821.2 --> 1826.88
man it really is like one moment it's

1824.24 --> 1829.96
just beautiful sunny and then it's like

1826.88 --> 1829.96
raining hard

1830.0 --> 1834.519
now right now it's raining hard

1890.799 --> 1893.039
all

1893.6 --> 1898.799
right yeah weird here gaining wisdom

1896.919 --> 1901.519
trying to get in the chat but for some

1898.799 --> 1904.399
reason he seems to be Shadow

1901.519 --> 1909.0
banned very

1904.399 --> 1909.0
strange I didn't do it

1958.24 --> 1965.32
anyway so yeah I've been watching some

1962.639 --> 1967.36
movies watching Owen Benjamin what was

1965.32 --> 1969.4399999999998
he talking about

1967.36 --> 1972.24
again let

1969.44 --> 1975.039
check man I have to say by the way I

1972.24 --> 1977.799
feel so much more stable than I did

1975.039 --> 1980.84
yesterday it's a big difference I don't

1977.799 --> 1985.8799999999999
I know what the hell that

1980.84 --> 1985.8799999999999
was but I felt like so exhausted

1986.159 --> 1991.919
yesterday oh yeah now remember om benjam

1988.679 --> 1995.3200000000002
was talking about who is your

1991.919 --> 1995.3200000000002
sustainer that was

1996.76 --> 2002.08
interesting I did have like a little bit

1999.48 --> 2005.679
of a realization this morning again

2002.08 --> 2005.6789999999999
spiritual realization

2009.919 --> 2016.72
do I like horror movies

2013.2 --> 2016.72
no no I

2021.76 --> 2028.36
don't but I realized that like because

2025.24 --> 2031.919
of all the hassle that's happened it's

2028.36 --> 2035.36
like not intellectually but like on an

2031.919 --> 2038.24
emotional level it's almost been like I

2035.36 --> 2040.519
lost trust in God

2038.24 --> 2040.519
by

2041.48 --> 2046.519
accident and Owen Benjamin like

2044.12 --> 2051.04
yesterday like

2046.519 --> 2054.44
really really showed me that and he

2051.04 --> 2057.879
basically like reignited some

2054.44 --> 2060.399
insights that I echoed in the chat there

2057.879 --> 2064.0
like holy [Â __Â ] like he's really right

2060.399 --> 2067.3199999999997
like if you're always in fear of

2064.0 --> 2070.359
something then you almost you justify

2067.32 --> 2074.0
that fear fear and

2070.359 --> 2076.2
that may actually create the cause of

2074.0 --> 2076.2
the

2077.839 --> 2083.599
fear and that was like a really helpful

2080.52 --> 2087.28
insight and again this morning I like I

2083.599 --> 2089.96
I really kept that in my head it's like

2087.28 --> 2093.44
yeah I I need to stop dwelling on

2089.96 --> 2096.119
certain types of fear scenarios like

2093.44 --> 2099.32
even if they do come to a

2096.119 --> 2103.8
degree like I need need

2099.32 --> 2105.96
to really actively Let It Go with a

2103.8 --> 2110.7200000000003
context not just like oh don't think

2105.96 --> 2110.7200000000003
about it but like really like this is

2111.2 --> 2120.4399999999996
pointless if you always focus on fear

2116.04 --> 2120.44
then you don't get room to

2121.88 --> 2127.119
live and

2123.96 --> 2129.32
so I've really actively tried to embrace

2127.119 --> 2132.6800000000003
that insight and I really thank Owen

2129.32 --> 2135.76
Benjamin for for bringing that up as a

2132.68 --> 2136.9199999999996
subject was really good I really kind of

2135.76 --> 2139.5200000000004
needed

2136.92 --> 2141.92
that and so it's like yeah I'm really

2139.52 --> 2142.8
just like okay it is things might be a

2141.92 --> 2146.04
little

2142.8 --> 2149.2400000000002
feeble I might be a little unstable but

2146.04 --> 2154.0
I do really just need to

2149.24 --> 2154.0
trust that it'll be all right

2176.319 --> 2179.119
all right

2183.2 --> 2188.359
anyway I might put that in the

2185.8 --> 2190.7200000000003
title cuz it's just good to be reminded

2188.359 --> 2190.72
about

2200.119 --> 2204.88
that how did I see it

2225.56 --> 2228.56
in

2285.28 --> 2291.44
right so yeah being afraid justifies the

2287.68 --> 2294.9199999999996
cause of the fear trust

2291.44 --> 2298.359
God I should say

2294.92 --> 2301.839
instead yeah trust God instead I like

2298.359 --> 2301.839
that that's that'll make a good

2304.599 --> 2308.96
title at least temporarily I mean not

2307.68 --> 2309.839
necessarily that we're going to talk

2308.96 --> 2313.44
about

2309.839 --> 2315.319
this it's just that it's been a good

2313.44 --> 2317.64
lesson for me

2315.319 --> 2320.56
personally and I think that part

2317.64 --> 2325.44
partially helped me maybe in full help

2320.56 --> 2329.319
me to be much more well rested

2325.44 --> 2331.64
today cuz I was also like really rushed

2329.319 --> 2334.319
like I have to do this I have to do that

2331.64 --> 2337.7999999999997
but I mean I don't technically have to

2334.319 --> 2339.839
rush to do all these things

2337.8 --> 2342.8390000000004
but it's like in my head it's just like

2339.839 --> 2346.2799999999997
I have to do everything really quickly

2342.839 --> 2346.2799999999997
but it's technically not

2349.68 --> 2356.3999999999996
true I have to just

2352.64 --> 2359.4
relax just relax it'll be all

2356.4 --> 2360.6800000000003
right I have to tell myself this now and

2359.4 --> 2363.64
I'm going

2360.68 --> 2367.0789999999997
to just

2363.64 --> 2370.2799999999997
to to fix myself again and to get out of

2367.079 --> 2374.4
this unstable face because like trying

2370.28 --> 2377.48
to rush it all the time and punishing

2374.4 --> 2380.7200000000003
for if I didn't

2377.48 --> 2382.48
succeed like it's not helping my

2380.72 --> 2386.24
stability at

2382.48 --> 2388.319
all so but anyway I hope I do sound more

2386.24 --> 2390.5989999999997
stable today at

2388.319 --> 2392.079
least right I'm going to get my coffee

2390.599 --> 2396.48
and my Illuminati cuz I'm looking

2392.079 --> 2396.48
forward to that I'll be right back

2427.28 --> 2430.28
e

2478.04 --> 2481.119
hey clutch good to see

2484.68 --> 2492.1189999999997
you it's easy to forget the trust God or

2487.8 --> 2492.119
blame him yeah I'm not blaming

2493.28 --> 2497.119
God but it's it is

2497.24 --> 2502.68
like fear can make you kind of like

2499.839 --> 2502.68
forget about

2503.839 --> 2510.16
him it's like you rearrange your

2506.64 --> 2514.44
priorities to more Earthly

2510.16 --> 2517.44
forms and then you lose

2514.44 --> 2521.839
track and that's been happening to would

2517.44 --> 2521.839
agree with me because of just like so

2523.68 --> 2528.48
many things that went wrong

2548.26 --> 2552.1290000000004
[Music]

2573.0 --> 2579.119
you felt like you watch something dirty

2575.0 --> 2579.119
well it is dirty duper

2586.839 --> 2594.72
I mean literally horror movies are fear

2589.68 --> 2594.72
porn they are dirty movies

2616.72 --> 2626.319
wow okay a man go

2620.079 --> 2626.319
that that is literally that that means

2627.96 --> 2634.359
nothing this your attempt to try to be

2631.2 --> 2639.04
wise or something cuz what you just said

2634.359 --> 2639.04
like literally doesn't mean anything

2647.0 --> 2651.52
you do conent oh well sure you

2654.16 --> 2660.5589999999997
do low fiber

2657.24 --> 2666.3999999999996
outs so maybe just try to

2660.559 --> 2666.4

well I like it when it actually has a

2725.88 --> 2728.88
point

2730.079 --> 2738.319
when you like use very long words to say

2733.52 --> 2738.319
very little I don't like that at all

[Applause]

3466.4 --> 3472.48
really drain on being in a major city gu

3469.119 --> 3472.48
yeah cities can

3472.559 --> 3477.7200000000003
suck especially like in periods like

3475.4 --> 3480.2400000000002
this when energy is kind of low and then

3477.72 --> 3481.52
everything just everybody just starts to

3480.24 --> 3485.0389999999998
collectively

3481.52 --> 3488.52
suck and it like depletes the overall

3485.039 --> 3488.5200000000004
energy that does

3491.48 --> 3495.64
happen I've been kind of lucky that it

3494.16 --> 3498.52
doesn't feel like that's really

3495.64 --> 3500.92
happening here

3498.52 --> 3503.88
though even though this is a pretty big

3500.92 --> 3508.119
city it's not like everybody's all

3503.88 --> 3508.119
demoralized everywhere all of a sudden

3509.28 --> 3513.559
getting your password next week

3535.039 --> 3539.079
okay for

3723.279 --> 3726.2
moon buggy by the

way like where is he

3730.1 --> 3733.23
[Applause]

3746.92 --> 3751.6800000000003
last I heard from him he was like in the

3748.52 --> 3751.68
middle of like moving

3752.64 --> 3758.2
stuff he post a video recently yeah but

3755.52 --> 3760.559
I mean where where has he been really

3758.2 --> 3760.5589999999997
missing

3774.839 --> 3778.799
him for

3803.22 --> 3806.35
[Applause]

3835.76 --> 3838.76
for

3867.599 --> 3870.839
do I have a password

3881.52 --> 3887.52
yeah would be cool to hang out yeah

3883.839 --> 3887.52
definitely fiber outs I mean I

3890.599 --> 3896.88
agree it would be kind of cool if at

3893.24 --> 3902.2
some point I could like meet some of you

3896.88 --> 3906.0
guys face to face and just hang for a

3902.2 --> 3906.0
bit that will be very

3906.76 --> 3912.8390000000004
interesting it would be good if it'd be

3910.0 --> 3916.44
in a moment where I do feel much more

3912.839 --> 3916.44
stable though

3947.559 --> 3951.2400000000002
yeah because you're so damn good at it

3953.52 --> 3957.64
fibs your paintings are great

3982.88 --> 3987.1600000000003
like it's really interesting CU in a way

3984.599 --> 3991.7200000000003
like what you do

3987.16 --> 3996.48
to me on an intuitive level proves

3991.72 --> 3998.8799999999997
that that AI could never beat a real

3996.48 --> 4002.599
artist like the things that you make

3998.88 --> 4005.359
like AI is like can't do that it It

4002.599 --> 4009.6400000000003
Could reconstruct what you

4005.359 --> 4013.359
got but it's not going to like from

4009.64 --> 4013.359
scratch makes something like

4013.76 --> 4019.7990000000004
that the way that you do that the the

4016.68 --> 4023.0789999999997
effects that it has like it it can't do

4019.799 --> 4026.839
that and you're like the living proof

4023.079 --> 4031.319
that that man is on

4026.839 --> 4031.319
top to me

4032.2 --> 4039.4399999999996
creatively I like to think of myself as

4034.559 --> 4039.44
a bit of a living proof as well but with

4039.839 --> 4048.48
you yeah definitely in the visual arts

bro what the hell is

4494.0 --> 4498.0
this for

4535.36 --> 4541.239
all right so sorry got busy

4558.8 --> 4561.8
right

4567.08 --> 4572.5199999999995
uh oh okay see you later clutch thanks

4570.04 --> 4572.5199999999995
for being

4578.88 --> 4585.88
there I'm trying to think of something

4581.12 --> 4589.4
to talk about it's a bit quiet here a

4585.88 --> 4593.56
little I mean that could

4589.4 --> 4597.48
change just uh have to find

4593.56 --> 4597.4800000000005
something interesting to talk

4601.159 --> 4608.638999999999
about Flat Earth yeah

4604.8 --> 4608.639
sure what about Flat

4613.52 --> 4619.400000000001
Earth yes today the the show kind of

4616.48 --> 4619.4
ended on

4621.92 --> 4629.639
interesting perception of how the

4625.96 --> 4632.76
inverse Square law light is like an

4629.639 --> 4637.12
issue soon as you start to assume that

4632.76 --> 4641.92
the celestial lights are light

4637.12 --> 4646.84
sources and that by regarding

4641.92 --> 4646.84
them whether they are or not

4648.199 --> 4655.919999999999
as non-local holographic angular

4651.719 --> 4655.92
manifestations that you basically

4655.96 --> 4661.76
bypass the

4659.12 --> 4663.8
inevitable part of the inverse Square

4661.76 --> 4667.76
law of light because there is no actual

4663.8 --> 4669.88
distance and so the intensity of the

4667.76 --> 4672.08
light is not

4669.88 --> 4675.04
dependent the celestial it's not

4672.08 --> 4676.84
dependent on

4675.04 --> 4679.44
the

4676.84 --> 4684.56
distance and that by regarding it like

4679.44 --> 4684.5599999999995
that is the only way to kind of resolve

4684.679 --> 4689.6
it

4686.88 --> 4691.2390000000005
because any Assumption of distance to

4689.6 --> 4693.56
any of the celestial lights including

4691.239 --> 4697.4
the Sun and the Moon and

4693.56 --> 4697.400000000001
everything it brings

4702.4 --> 4707.159
issues is it yeah the Earth is FL

4710.159 --> 4717.92
absolutely there's no Earth curve The

4713.56 --> 4723.88
Horizon is not geometric in

4717.92 --> 4723.88
comption to the heliocentric Globe Earth

4725.679 --> 4731.56
claim Black Swan

4728.52 --> 4735.320000000001
observation it's definitely proven that

4731.56 --> 4735.320000000001
the Earth is flat

4735.76 --> 4739.639
INF for square is well known well

4737.56 --> 4742.6
apparently it's not really well known

4739.639 --> 4744.52
enough to Ballers to realize like oh

4742.6 --> 4746.2390000000005
wait everything we believed in is

4744.52 --> 4750.120000000001
completely

4746.239 --> 4752.08
wrong right because anytime anything

4750.12 --> 4754.88
that is well

4752.08 --> 4757.36
known as soon as you put your attention

4754.88 --> 4760.36
to it and it reveals like oh wait that

4757.36 --> 4762.36
proves everything we believe is wrong

4760.36 --> 4766.08
yeah then you very easily forget about

4762.36 --> 4769.159
it don't you yeah just like second law

4766.08 --> 4771.92
of Thermodynamics oh wait everything we

4769.159 --> 4775.92
believed was wrong about outer space oh

4771.92 --> 4778.4
oh well isn't it well

4775.92 --> 4781.12
known isn't it well

4778.4 --> 4783.48
known

4781.12 --> 4786.08
yeah yeah well not that well known

4783.48 --> 4788.0
because if it was that well known then

4786.08 --> 4789.96
everybody would know that Earth is

4788.0 --> 4793.199
definitely not a globe and that outer

4789.96 --> 4796.199
space is fake and violates laws of

4793.199 --> 4796.199
nature

4810.28 --> 4816.28
it's sphar is curved all the

4813.4 --> 4819.679
way

4816.28 --> 4821.92
yeah and even if it was supposedly not a

4819.679 --> 4824.2390000000005
perfect sphere and there's still then

4821.92 --> 4826.08
supposed to be consistent curve which

4824.239 --> 4828.759999999999
there isn't

4826.08 --> 4828.76
there isn't at

4829.679 --> 4836.04
all water Finds Its level level being

4836.12 --> 4840.5599999999995
straight there's no problem looking at

4838.44 --> 4843.919999999999
stars yeah well not when you don't think

4840.56 --> 4843.92
about it

4864.4 --> 4869.92
ever seen them no I've never seen

4876.6 --> 4881.76
Stars hey expanding forehead have you

4879.76 --> 4887.4800000000005
ever been to the

4881.76 --> 4887.4800000000005
toilet got any more extreme stupid

4893.08 --> 4897.679
questions are you just here to get

4895.199 --> 4900.32
banned are you just a triggered little

4897.679 --> 4903.36
Ballard funny [Â __Â ]

4900.32 --> 4906.28
with who can't face that the Earth is in

4903.36 --> 4908.679
the globe and that's not a matter of

4906.28 --> 4911.48
belief or

4908.679 --> 4915.8
conviction that it's provably not a

4911.48 --> 4915.799999999999
sphere are you one of those people

4915.84 --> 4919.2390000000005
yeah category

4920.679 --> 4928.28
Ballard those that are left

4924.28 --> 4928.28
behind intellectually

4953.32 --> 4957.88
I did not say anything bad about you

4955.159 --> 4960.879999999999
yeah but you asked a really really

4957.88 --> 4960.88
stupid question

4965.08 --> 4973.719
though and that is insulting

4968.719 --> 4975.0
yeah ever seen ever looking at ever seen

4973.719 --> 4979.199
a star

4975.0 --> 4979.199
like that's an insulting

4984.88 --> 4990.96
question yeah just like hey have you

4987.56 --> 4994.120000000001
ever been to the toilet that's a stupid

4990.96 --> 4999.0
question too that's why I asked you to

4994.12 --> 4999.0
show you how stupid your question was

5020.159 --> 5026.28
sock account made today by the way so

5023.52 --> 5029.4400000000005
you will probably get kicked out before

5026.28 --> 5031.5599999999995
the end of the stream but fine hey Bard

5029.44 --> 5034.239
wants to get

5031.56 --> 5036.4800000000005
in get annoying and Rowdy for a little

5034.239 --> 5039.04
bit I can deal with

5036.48 --> 5042.599999999999
that been dealing with it for almost a

5039.04 --> 5042.6
decade so

5074.84 --> 5078.2390000000005
was that it

5100.679 --> 5103.4800000000005
that ran out

5123.32 --> 5127.28
quick for

5181.96 --> 5186.2390000000005
well I guess that ran out really quickly

5187.719 --> 5192.96
Ballers these days just don't have any

5190.28 --> 5195.719
more

5192.96 --> 5197.4800000000005
stamina maybe it's because they just

5195.719 --> 5199.84
thoroughly

5197.48 --> 5203.759999999999
know they just

5199.84 --> 5203.76
know there's nowhere to

5205.0 --> 5212.639
go they probably figured out

5209.4 --> 5214.799999999999
that they were falsely conditioned to

5212.639 --> 5216.679
believe the Earth is a globe they they

5214.8 --> 5220.4800000000005
figured it

5216.679 --> 5223.719
out they just refus to let go because

5220.48 --> 5226.04
it's probably to them seemingly easier

5223.719 --> 5226.04
to

5226.56 --> 5231.280000000001
just go with

5228.56 --> 5233.119000000001
it until you face a flat earther of

5231.28 --> 5237.159
course that actually knows how to

5233.119 --> 5237.159
explain things properly

5249.8 --> 5258.1990000000005
if all you have yeah but it's not all we

5254.84 --> 5261.28
have playground insults

5258.199 --> 5265.08
yeah it's not all we have yeah no those

5261.28 --> 5267.96
come after after I point out the

5265.08 --> 5272.6
devastating destroying

5267.96 --> 5274.88
arguments that absolutely nullify any

5272.6 --> 5278.360000000001
idea or conviction that the Earth is a

5274.88 --> 5282.0
globe in outer space yeah they come

5278.36 --> 5282.0
afterward they're the

5285.92 --> 5292.36
bonus you can't have gas

5290.119 --> 5294.44
pressure without a

5292.36 --> 5300.04
container can't

5294.44 --> 5303.678999999999
have very thick gas pressure at ground

5300.04 --> 5306.119
level if there's an open system and

5303.679 --> 5306.119
there's

5306.8 --> 5314.28
endless amounts of volume available for

5309.76 --> 5316.1990000000005
that gas to escape into yeah you can't

5314.28 --> 5319.759999999999
have that that doesn't

5316.199 --> 5322.599999999999
work the gas will always try to spread

5319.76 --> 5325.88
out within the available volume and

5322.6 --> 5330.2390000000005
equalize and maybe gradiate but it's

5325.88 --> 5333.6
going to gradiate based on the available

5330.239 --> 5334.599999999999
volume yeah and things like temperature

5333.6 --> 5336.6
influence

5334.6 --> 5339.0
but it's still even with temperature

5336.6 --> 5344.6
influences no matter how dramatic it's

5339.0 --> 5347.32
going to gradiate based on the available

5344.6 --> 5352.6
volume yeah and if the available volume

5347.32 --> 5356.28
is like literally endless amounts more

5352.6 --> 5358.96
than the the measurable gradient of gas

5356.28 --> 5362.599999999999
here at the

5358.96 --> 5366.36
surface well then it's not an endless

5362.6 --> 5370.719
amount of volume which is also known in

5366.36 --> 5375.92
heliocentrism as outer space it does not

5370.719 --> 5379.159
exist yeah that's not a playground

5375.92 --> 5381.92
insult repeating the script Oh you mean

5379.159 --> 5385.119
the devastating

5381.92 --> 5388.08
arguments expanding forehead the

5385.119 --> 5392.4
devastating functional

5388.08 --> 5396.08
arguments oh I left Fed so I'm not going

5392.4 --> 5399.679
to make de devastating arguments to the

5396.08 --> 5403.84
globe anymore really is that how it

5399.679 --> 5406.119
works oh you can't make the arguments if

5403.84 --> 5411.2390000000005
you're not part of that

5406.119 --> 5412.44
group a no no that's not how that works

5411.239 --> 5414.32
at

5412.44 --> 5419.08
all at

5414.32 --> 5421.96
all no the arguments you can keep those

5419.08 --> 5425.92
arguments even if you don't watch that

5421.96 --> 5429.28
show anymore you could just learn them

5425.92 --> 5433.719
and use them they're freely available

5429.28 --> 5437.239
for everybody all you have to do is

5433.719 --> 5439.199
listen and see how it works and then you

5437.239 --> 5445.28
can use them

5439.199 --> 5447.239
yourself to Tumble a Ballard who thinks

5445.28 --> 5449.599999999999
that the Earth is a ball and flat

5447.239 --> 5451.48
earthers are stupid just like I'm doing

5449.6 --> 5454.719
right now anybody could do that you

5451.48 --> 5458.0
don't have to be part of Fe

5454.719 --> 5459.199
to make those arguments those arguments

5458.0 --> 5462.199
just

5459.199 --> 5462.199
work

5463.199 --> 5470.879999999999
huh oh pardon Nathan circus oh can't

5467.159 --> 5475.759999999999
handle it does it hurt do the arguments

5470.88 --> 5479.1990000000005
hurt you is it painful

5475.76 --> 5482.719
knowing figuring it out that the Earth

5479.199 --> 5487.0
is not a globe is it painful is

5482.719 --> 5488.84
it oh oh don't be part of Nathan

5487.0 --> 5491.76
circus

5488.84 --> 5494.28
a yeah I'm not part of Nathan

5491.76 --> 5498.52
circus I don't even know like what he's

5494.28 --> 5502.32
talking about right now it's probably

5498.52 --> 5504.639
mostly the same arguments as always cuz

5502.32 --> 5507.5199999999995
there's always ballards like you that is

5504.639 --> 5511.08
going to pop up and do the same nonsense

5507.52 --> 5513.719
hor [Â __Â ] over and over again cuz you

5511.08 --> 5515.88
keep in this dementia cycle where you

5513.719 --> 5518.719
just just keep forgetting all these

5515.88 --> 5520.8
devastating arguments that absolutely

5518.719 --> 5523.159
irrevocably prove the Earth is not a

5520.8 --> 5525.639
globe and that outer space is

5523.159 --> 5529.04
fake yeah so you keep just forgetting

5525.639 --> 5531.719
about it and just oh I'm back oh oh look

5529.04 --> 5534.92
at all the playground insults are you

5531.719 --> 5538.32
part of that cult why are you repeating

5534.92 --> 5541.4800000000005
the same stuff as that group yeah

5538.32 --> 5544.08
because they're devastating arguments

5541.48 --> 5546.4
that prove irrevocably

5544.08 --> 5549.8
that the Earth is not a

5546.4 --> 5553.48
globe yeah that's

5549.8 --> 5556.84
why you think I'm just gonna not do that

5553.48 --> 5562.599999999999
anymore if a ball tart shows up in my

5556.84 --> 5565.4800000000005
chat no no I will definitely keep doing

5562.6 --> 5568.2390000000005
that when I feel like it other times

5565.48 --> 5570.718999999999
I'll just kick kick him out

5568.239 --> 5572.919999999999
immediately or right now yeah the chat's

5570.719 --> 5577.08
been kind of silent and everything and

5572.92 --> 5581.679
thought hey a balard why not why not

5577.08 --> 5581.679
just do it again you

5584.719 --> 5591.08
know shame you left them then if their

5589.28 --> 5595.92
ideas are good

5591.08 --> 5598.5199999999995
no no it's not a shame I left them and I

5595.92 --> 5601.56
don't need to be part of them just

5598.52 --> 5606.2390000000005
because their technical arguments are

5601.56 --> 5608.360000000001
good cuz I learned those arguments it's

5606.239 --> 5610.28
pretty much as developed as can be

5608.36 --> 5613.32
there's not really going to be any new

5610.28 --> 5613.32
arguments popping

5613.76 --> 5619.280000000001
up and besides the reason I left is not

5617.159 --> 5622.159
because of the quality of the arguments

5619.28 --> 5626.159
it's because of social

5622.159 --> 5626.159
issues that's why I

5629.0 --> 5634.48
left oh I need to learn some

5631.92 --> 5638.36
manners a

5634.48 --> 5641.759999999999
I'm sorry I'm just saying it as it

5638.36 --> 5644.28
is yeah I don't give a [Â __Â ] that you

5641.76 --> 5646.679
don't like it and I am going to use

5644.28 --> 5649.119
swear words I'm going to call you a

5646.679 --> 5651.88
Ballard if you can't handle that well

5649.119 --> 5655.599999999999
then just [Â __Â ]

5651.88 --> 5658.84
off yeah it's not my problem yeah you

5655.6 --> 5660.719
see you don't have any level of

5658.84 --> 5665.400000000001
authority over

5660.719 --> 5668.96
me at all and if you come in here and

5665.4 --> 5671.239
act like a Ballard I'm going to call you

5668.96 --> 5671.2390000000005
a

5676.88 --> 5683.36
Ballard and I'm going to laugh at you

5680.679 --> 5685.84
because of that because of that behavior

5683.36 --> 5685.839999999999
that is

5688.119 --> 5693.839999999999
barded yeah and manners have nothing to

5691.32 --> 5699.44
do with it

5693.84 --> 5699.4400000000005
your manners are that of a demented

5700.119 --> 5708.5199999999995
person I reserve the right to be amused

5704.32 --> 5710.199
by that and express it in certain types

5708.52 --> 5713.8
of

5710.199 --> 5716.96
words because you're in my chat yeah my

5713.8 --> 5720.56
chat that's my domain of my show where I

5716.96 --> 5723.76
have full authority over how to manage

5720.56 --> 5723.76
my chat

5732.8 --> 5738.400000000001
so I don't need to do anything

5735.4 --> 5741.879999999999
especially if you a sock account that

5738.4 --> 5743.799999999999
was literally made today says it in my

5741.88 --> 5748.84
chat

5743.8 --> 5748.84
yeah don't get cocky now

5763.04 --> 5766.239
is anybody else here

5766.4 --> 5771.119
still

5768.32 --> 5774.44
anybody I mean it's getting kind of

5771.119 --> 5776.48
weird just seeing just the sock account

5774.44 --> 5779.599999999999
filling up my chat it would be kind of

5776.48 --> 5782.44
nice if anybody else said

5779.6 --> 5785.4400000000005
anything hello debatable D that's

5782.44 --> 5785.44
something

5801.48 --> 5807.48
oh

5803.4 --> 5809.199
look wow yeah I'm sorry but anything

5807.48 --> 5812.4
you're saying right there is not going

5809.199 --> 5816.48
to have any influence on me whatsoever

5812.4 --> 5816.48
you see you're a

5818.719 --> 5823.6
Ballard and so the only thing I can

5821.239 --> 5827.879999999999
really do in response to anything that

5823.6 --> 5827.88
you say is just laugh

5831.04 --> 5835.5199999999995
internally just got in had a rough day

5833.36 --> 5837.759999999999
oh sorry to hear that debatable D what

5835.52 --> 5837.76
is

5837.96 --> 5842.679
happening just having an amicable show

5840.6 --> 5846.08
overall and then this Ballard here

5842.679 --> 5848.4400000000005
expanding for head came in and started

5846.08 --> 5851.28
to act like a classic

5848.44 --> 5854.599999999999
Bard I don't know it's probably kosho or

5851.28 --> 5854.599999999999
something or one of those

5859.199 --> 5866.08
guys they probably got grilled over at

5862.239 --> 5868.36
fed and so they just left and then saw

5866.08 --> 5871.8
hey Flat Earth early bird is life let's

5868.36 --> 5871.799999999999
just try to do it

5872.0 --> 5879.4
there and then complain like oh why are

5875.159 --> 5881.799999999999
you still talking like your fed Oh I

5879.4 --> 5884.4
thought you left those oh so that means

5881.8 --> 5890.52
I'm going to stop using those arguments

5884.4 --> 5890.5199999999995
am I no hey Mike sedun good to see

5902.44 --> 5906.48
you e

5939.52 --> 5945.040000000001
all right anyway so anybody out there

5942.88 --> 5947.52
watching still don't forget to Rogan it

5945.04 --> 5950.639
up come on guys I want to see some I've

5947.52 --> 5953.320000000001
been been so many people in the chat I'm

5950.639 --> 5957.2390000000005
just seeing one what the hell is this

5953.32 --> 5959.96
there have been like 10 to 20 people in

5957.239 --> 5964.119
my chat why is there just one thumbs up

5959.96 --> 5968.56
what the hell is this guys 24 watching

5964.119 --> 5968.5599999999995
why is there one freaking thumb

5981.119 --> 5985.759999999999
up just

5983.199 --> 5988.598999999999
watching just catching you kicking the

5985.76 --> 5990.639
baller out of my show no but I I'm not

5988.599 --> 5995.32
kicking him out of my show I'm just

5990.639 --> 5995.32
addressing him Mike S

5995.679 --> 6002.28
I don't need to kick him out I'm just

5999.36 --> 6005.679
demolishing him right there on the

6002.28 --> 6008.4
spot and so he's just resorting to

6005.679 --> 6011.2390000000005
complaining about format and about oh

6008.4 --> 6014.879999999999
you're using swear

6011.239 --> 6017.598999999999
words like yeah and I'm using absolutely

6014.88 --> 6017.599
devastating

6022.159 --> 6029.08
arguments yeah and then after I use the

6025.76 --> 6031.159000000001
devastating arguments then I can just

6029.08 --> 6032.96
resort to a little bit of name calling

6031.159 --> 6035.4
yeah

6032.96 --> 6038.76
naming

6035.4 --> 6043.0
psycher yeah I'm a psycher a little and

6038.76 --> 6046.92
and one of the psychonom that I've

6043.0 --> 6050.04
designated is a balard somebody that's

6046.92 --> 6054.4800000000005
specifically intellectually

6050.04 --> 6056.8
behind based on their

6054.48 --> 6059.959999999999
unsubstantiated belief that the Earth is

6056.8 --> 6064.360000000001
a globe that has been conditioned by

6059.96 --> 6066.04
Society onto them and they can't deal

6064.36 --> 6068.5599999999995
with it they can't deal with that

6066.04 --> 6072.159
they've been taught a lie and so they

6068.56 --> 6075.84
angrily hold on to that lie and anybody

6072.159 --> 6077.839999999999
who tests that lie and proves them wrong

6075.84 --> 6079.84
they play they downplay them and they

6077.84 --> 6083.360000000001
say they're stupid or they're Petty or

6079.84 --> 6086.159000000001
they're beneath them yeah that's called

6083.36 --> 6086.159
called a

6088.28 --> 6092.159
balard that's what they call

6104.159 --> 6112.32
them star is it this pigeons and

6107.88 --> 6112.32
chess righty doie

6118.159 --> 6125.32
yeah I mean Flat Earth is in is in the

6122.56 --> 6127.2390000000005
title yeah I I mean I've rarely talk

6125.32 --> 6132.119
like the last time I've

6127.239 --> 6132.119
talked with a ball [Â __Â ] in my chat has

6132.32 --> 6138.4
been at least a

6135.56 --> 6141.0
month if not more they they barely come

6138.4 --> 6143.36
show up I think most of them just kind

6141.0 --> 6144.4
of hang around

6143.36 --> 6147.08
Nathan

6144.4 --> 6149.839999999999
Oakley's Flat Earth debate because well

6147.08 --> 6152.08
Nathan Oakley is non-stop talking about

6149.84 --> 6153.88
it that's like his subject he's always

6152.08 --> 6157.239
just talking about how the Earth is flat

6153.88 --> 6160.4400000000005
and not a ball and

6157.239 --> 6162.36
how ball believer YouTubers and

6160.44 --> 6165.159
anti-flat

6162.36 --> 6169.239
earthers try

6165.159 --> 6171.199
to create Illusions to perpetuate the

6169.239 --> 6173.799999999999
ball belief and he's like continually

6171.199 --> 6176.5599999999995
focused on that but for me

6173.8 --> 6176.56
that just gets

6180.239 --> 6184.839999999999
tiresome like I can't just deal with

6183.0 --> 6188.239
that all the

6184.84 --> 6191.28
time but that doesn't mean that I I

6188.239 --> 6195.0
don't know how to do it anymore I mean

6191.28 --> 6195.0
it been there for like eight

6197.4 --> 6203.159
years you don't unlearn these things

6211.84 --> 6214.76
look at how sunny it

6216.84 --> 6220.1990000000005
is that's

6224.119 --> 6230.759999999999
nice you can barely recognize the way it

6227.159 --> 6235.04
looks now with before it's crazy how

6230.76 --> 6235.04
quickly this weather switches around

6238.56 --> 6241.679
nice to have some sun

6245.04 --> 6252.159
though right yeah what's what's up

6247.199 --> 6252.159
debatable D you need to share something

6265.55 --> 6269.1
[Music]

6273.42 --> 6276.939
[Music]

6288.44 --> 6293.5599999999995
oh yeah yeah yesterday was interesting I

6290.44 --> 6295.44
saw like by happen stance also

6293.56 --> 6299.96
a

6295.44 --> 6299.96
Dutch uh Flat Earth discussion

6301.119 --> 6307.92
online I talked to you and you're a

6303.92 --> 6311.2390000000005
baller yeah well that's your problem but

6307.92 --> 6313.52
I mean you don't you don't act like a

6311.239 --> 6316.0
Ballard that much yeah just because

6313.52 --> 6317.679
you're a baller doesn't mean you're a

6316.0 --> 6320.679
Ballard

6317.679 --> 6320.679
balart

6321.36 --> 6328.159
is basically somebody who is a believer

6325.76 --> 6331.96
that denies that it's a

6328.159 --> 6334.638999999999
belief and who's very arrogant about it

6331.96 --> 6337.679
and patronizing towards flat

6334.639 --> 6340.599
earthers and basically ends up lying a

6337.679 --> 6342.76
lot that that's big component of a of a

6340.599 --> 6345.400000000001
real balart is that they lie to

6342.76 --> 6347.639
themselves and others to reinforce their

6345.4 --> 6349.4
belief I haven't really seen you do that

6347.639 --> 6353.4800000000005
a lot debatable

6349.4 --> 6357.36
D so you're you're just a ball

6353.48 --> 6360.199
then I guess but I mean you don't really

6357.36 --> 6362.159
argue much for it so I don't really care

6360.199 --> 6367.678999999999
I mean if you just it's like oh I have

6362.159 --> 6370.36
this remote belief it's like okay well

6367.679 --> 6373.2390000000005
whatever like that's your problem then I

6370.36 --> 6376.28
mean you're not making your belief my

6373.239 --> 6378.36
problem so I'm not really going to call

6376.28 --> 6380.92
you a ballart then all the time because

6378.36 --> 6383.679
you don't act like

6380.92 --> 6386.28
one even though you're a b believer I've

6383.679 --> 6388.04
had more people in my chat that were

6386.28 --> 6392.48
ball Believers that weren't just

6388.04 --> 6392.48
continually whining about it

6396.159 --> 6402.159
right I could be turned to become a

6399.4 --> 6402.159
cyinder

6407.28 --> 6411.5599999999995
okay that's weird

6423.599 --> 6431.04
right Gary yeah hopefully I mean I found

6427.639 --> 6431.04
I find available D

6431.52 --> 6435.96
doable in my chat

6462.239 --> 6469.959999999999
all right but anyway

6465.88 --> 6472.56
guys don't forget to Rogan it up I can

6469.96 --> 6474.84
only see two here I still find this kind

6472.56 --> 6474.84
of

6501.04 --> 6506.44
baffling all right

6504.239 --> 6512.08
looks like expanded

6506.44 --> 6512.08
forehead has quit his barded

6516.08 --> 6520.88
inquiry I guess he figured out that he

6518.88 --> 6524.08
was

6520.88 --> 6527.719
defeated thumbed it up thanks Deb D

6524.08 --> 6527.719
appreciate that

6534.599 --> 6540.56
do the trolls give you thumbs down you

6537.32 --> 6544.0
can't see the amount of thumbs down so I

6540.56 --> 6544.0
don't know debatable you have no

6545.08 --> 6551.76
idea I mean YouTube turned off thumbs

6548.119 --> 6554.639
down like years ago they just turned it

6551.76 --> 6554.639
off you can't see

6556.719 --> 6563.28
it I'm sure it have like lots of thumbs

6559.92 --> 6565.08
down all the time if you could see it

6563.28 --> 6568.32
cuz there's trolls that are just like

6565.08 --> 6570.199
maniacally hating on me like forever

6568.32 --> 6571.84
might even be like just singular

6570.199 --> 6574.08
individual that has like all these

6571.84 --> 6575.360000000001
socker accounts just so they could thumb

6574.08 --> 6577.8
it

6575.36 --> 6580.759999999999
down cuz that's the kind of people these

6577.8 --> 6586.52
ballards are some of them are just

6580.76 --> 6586.52
really vile repulsive disgusting

6587.96 --> 6595.679
people if you see their faces you'd

6590.88 --> 6595.679
probably want to throw up for

6629.84 --> 6637.119000000001
I think it's a good thing CU it got bad

6633.159 --> 6641.5599999999995
well I yeah no it's not really a good

6637.119 --> 6641.5599999999995
thing to bable D because it just showed

6642.239 --> 6648.44
that YouTube is basically in ways not

6646.04 --> 6650.48
like the company but like the the

6648.44 --> 6653.4
community is like corrupted with the

6650.48 --> 6655.44
amount of trolls that go around

6653.4 --> 6658.638999999999
the thumbs down showed that there is

6655.44 --> 6658.638999999999
like giant troll

6660.679 --> 6666.32
communities and that is what the thumbs

6663.719 --> 6670.159
down revealed and like instead of

6666.32 --> 6672.5599999999995
dealing with that YouTube decided to

6670.159 --> 6672.5599999999995
mask

6675.599 --> 6681.28
it they're not really dealing with it at

6678.239 --> 6684.5599999999995
all and so the troll communities persist

6681.28 --> 6684.5599999999995
out there

6688.079 --> 6695.599
no I can't see the ratio in YouTube Das

6690.76 --> 6695.599
Studio get dashboard or anything nope

6734.36 --> 6738.96
is really looking kind of nice right now

6742.23 --> 6745.389999999999

today I don't know all kinds of stuff I

7211.48 --> 7217.079
mean it's been very different I even had

7214.119 --> 7219.28
a Ballard socker account in

7217.079 --> 7222.5199999999995
here just

7219.28 --> 7224.8
uh half an hour ago

7222.52 --> 7227.76
that I gave a bit of a

7224.8 --> 7231.56
treatment until they started complaining

7227.76 --> 7233.8
about how rude I was and and then he

7231.56 --> 7233.8
just

7235.56 --> 7239.8
left but that was kind of fun for a

7242.199 --> 7249.678999999999
bit and before that it's been mostly

7244.92 --> 7249.679
just like I don't know just casual

7250.119 --> 7259.04
talk me giving a bit of a mini review on

7255.92 --> 7261.639
my Star Wars movie

7259.04 --> 7265.599
continuation

7261.639 --> 7267.8
and situation out here what damn it now

7265.599 --> 7270.719
the weather's already changed around

7267.8 --> 7274.1990000000005
again I mean what the hell man it just

7270.719 --> 7275.96
keep look like do you even recognize the

7274.199 --> 7277.678999999999
way this looks with the last time I

7275.96 --> 7281.079
showed it which isn't like even 10

7277.679 --> 7281.079
minutes ago

7284.239 --> 7291.598999999999
like this literally looks nothing

7287.199 --> 7291.598999999999
alike weather is drunk today

7299.639 --> 7306.400000000001
yeah I I feel like I I feel at least

7303.8 --> 7310.84
like I personally am a lot more stable

7306.4 --> 7310.839999999999
than the weather is so that's something

7320.32 --> 7325.4
yeah I feel a lot better than yesterday

7322.04 --> 7325.4
yesterday I was not doing

7326.28 --> 7331.96
great I was just so tired today I feel

7330.28 --> 7334.5599999999995
much

7331.96 --> 7338.8
better also the internet seems to be

7334.56 --> 7342.119000000001
holding up even after two hours of live

7338.8 --> 7345.04
streaming right theoretically it could

7342.119 --> 7347.598999999999
cut off at any moment I don't know

7345.04 --> 7348.88
because I don't know exactly how much

7347.599 --> 7351.360000000001
internet

7348.88 --> 7354.32
bandwidth the YouTube streaming is

7351.36 --> 7354.32
actually

7367.599 --> 7376.92
using so if I suddenly yeah get CAU of

7372.28 --> 7376.92
then you know I ran out of data

7378.92 --> 7382.92
bandwidth let's hope that doesn't

7383.44 --> 7388.159
happen but even if I do you will still

7386.119 --> 7392.4
see me tomorrow I'll just have to do a

for e

8299.15 --> 8302.279999999999
[Music]

8307.84 --> 8311.24
sorry about the delays

8318.519 --> 8323.84
guys just some I had to do some

8321.08 --> 8326.359
technical maintenance

8323.84 --> 8330.28
there yeah he's got some issues with the

8326.359 --> 8330.28
device fortunately

8349.28 --> 8354.2
tin foil yeah but I mean you can even

8351.559 --> 8357.399
use tin you can use tin foil to

8354.2 --> 8361.559000000001
basically Shield yourself

8357.399 --> 8365.039999999999
off from wifi or you can l

8361.559 --> 8365.039999999999
make an antenna out of

8365.8 --> 8368.8
it

8389.64 --> 8393.68
both for

8428.16 --> 8430.479
right

8433.479 --> 8438.64
anyhow yeah I'm all about the land

8436.16 --> 8442.08
cables when it comes to

8438.64 --> 8444.8
internet but I mean yeah if the land if

8442.08 --> 8447.24
the cables are cut off somehow there's

8444.8 --> 8452.119999999999
damage and you need

8447.24 --> 8454.399
to wait for it to be repaired for week

8452.12 --> 8457.68
yeah then sometimes you just can't help

8454.399 --> 8457.68
it you just have to

8457.72 --> 8462.479
use some other way to get it through

8462.76 --> 8467.56
Wireless and thus far I have to say that

8465.96 --> 8471.279999999999
like using the

8467.56 --> 8473.96
4G system that this is with all the data

8471.28 --> 8475.720000000001
traffic that it basically costs it

8473.96 --> 8479.039999999999
doesn't really seem to make a

8475.72 --> 8482.8
devastating impact on me 4G doesn't seem

8479.04 --> 8485.479000000001
to be as devastating to me as 5G which

8482.8 --> 8487.88
is the same as Wi-Fi Wi-Fi really seems

8485.479 --> 8492.599999999999
to be very

8487.88 --> 8495.72
disruptive but 4G not so much like I'm

8492.6 --> 8495.720000000001
really noticing the

8507.04 --> 8513.479000000001
difference and someone give you a

8510.98 --> 8517.8
[Music]

8513.479 --> 8517.8
cable that makes no damn sense

8522.52 --> 8527.92
duper not talking about the landan cable

8526.479 --> 8533.08
in the

8527.92 --> 8533.08
house 5G same as Wi-Fi

8535.8 --> 8541.16
yeah that's

8537.76 --> 8544.16
right 5G is technically

8541.16 --> 8544.16
identical to

8551.2 --> 8558.16
WiFi right and this the thing about

8555.12 --> 8562.2
Wi-Fi is that the reach is not great

8558.16 --> 8563.96
it's ideal for a lot of data transfer

8562.2 --> 8568.720000000001
it's just it doesn't have a lot of reach

8563.96 --> 8570.56
and so if You' have 5G phones it'll be

8568.72 --> 8573.599999999999
that you would have to have Wi-Fi

8570.56 --> 8577.68
transmitters everywhere transmitting all

8573.6 --> 8581.640000000001
the time and that was the the great

8577.68 --> 8581.64
objection against 5G

8583.12 --> 8588.160000000002
phones that you'd have to have so many

8586.2 --> 8591.28
of these

8588.16 --> 8593.64
Wireless radiators

8591.28 --> 8597.76
everywhere because it doesn't have

8593.64 --> 8600.96
distance but that's like a terrible idea

8597.76 --> 8602.439
it's terrible

8600.96 --> 8606.399
really bad

8602.439 --> 8609.52
idea to just have all transmitters

8606.399 --> 8612.8
everywhere right it's much better to

8609.52 --> 8615.08
just try to rely upon a system that has

8612.8 --> 8618.199999999999
more reach so you don't have to have

8615.08 --> 8620.64
transmitters absolutely everywhere just

8618.2 --> 8624.640000000001
to to be able to have a connection

8620.64 --> 8624.64
that's a terrible idea

8653.279 --> 8656.2
right but people don't even know that

8655.0 --> 8661.24
like about

8656.2 --> 8664.479000000001
5G because most phones these days have

8661.24 --> 8666.359
as as you were 5G capability but people

8664.479 --> 8668.479
just see like oh they have a Wi-Fi

8666.359 --> 8671.92
transmitter because that's basically

8668.479 --> 8674.88
what that is but if You' be completely

8671.92 --> 8677.64
dependent on that exclusively you're in

8674.88 --> 8677.64
a terrible

8685.68 --> 8692.319
position

8687.399 --> 8692.319
oh okay it's high Band Wi-Fi

8719.319 --> 8723.278999999999
okay e

8750.359 --> 8758.76
L Angel Rose 5G is for future things to

8754.359 --> 8758.76
what do you mean future things

8785.72 --> 8788.92
when everybody has

8790.56 --> 8795.24
implant yeah so never

8817.319 --> 8822.08
seriously everybody's going to have

8819.12 --> 8823.479000000001
implants no they w't who the hell is

8822.08 --> 8826.52
going to do that

8823.479 --> 8829.72
nobody I mean unless you participate in

8826.52 --> 8832.04
medical experimentations and then you

8829.72 --> 8835.76
might just be getting these weird things

8832.04 --> 8841.319000000001
inside of you that do actually work on

8835.76 --> 8843.399
that without you being told about it

8841.319 --> 8845.6
but I mean like nobody's going to

8843.399 --> 8848.319
there's not going to be a time where at

8845.6 --> 8851.08
some point people are just going to

8848.319 --> 8854.519999999999
consciously decide to have like

8851.08 --> 8854.52
implants just

8855.279 --> 8860.12
no like that's not going to happen

8857.96 --> 8864.56
unless people lose

8860.12 --> 8867.439
complete sovereignty control and

8864.56 --> 8870.8
autonomy and they're like you must do

8867.439 --> 8872.76
this like as soon as the techn rats can

8870.8 --> 8875.358999999999
just dictate on what you're supposed to

8872.76 --> 8878.319
do with your body yeah then pretty much

8875.359 --> 8880.800000000001
anything can happen includes mass

8878.319 --> 8884.0
suicide I mean it's not even that far

8880.8 --> 8886.278999999999
off then

8884.0 --> 8887.92
but I don't think we're ever going to

8886.279 --> 8891.560000000001
get to that

8887.92 --> 8894.72
point cuz well that would pretty much be

8891.56 --> 8894.72
the end

8901.16 --> 8911.279
why why is Radio wa no I don't think

8907.52 --> 8911.279
so I'm not sure

8921.72 --> 8928.76
though 3 goggles are mobile phones

8951.2 --> 8958.560000000001
oh okay the bable D didn't know that

8954.319 --> 8958.56
Wi-Fi 5G Networks

8960.6 --> 8965.800000000001
fifth generation

8962.16 --> 8969.039999999999
versus 5 gahz yeah that is extremely

8965.8 --> 8969.039999999999
confusing then

8979.92 --> 8988.12
yeah yeah Angel Rose you can just

8983.479 --> 8991.16
completely forget about that

8988.12 --> 8993.52
yeah it's just not going to happen like

8991.16 --> 8995.76
those things might be available it will

8993.52 --> 9000.319000000001
be a bunch of

8995.76 --> 9003.800000000001
snubs bunch of snobs might have that and

9000.319 --> 9003.8
literally nobody

9008.24 --> 9014.8
else like seriously hand gestures for

9012.279 --> 9018.24
controllers

9014.8 --> 9018.24
suck it

9018.56 --> 9023.319
sucks yeah those things already have

9021.24 --> 9027.24
been around they were around 10 years

9023.319 --> 9030.319
ago guess what oh you don't really hear

9027.24 --> 9033.199999999999
about those anymore why would that be

9030.319 --> 9036.119999999999
because they

9033.2 --> 9039.12
sucked a

9036.12 --> 9039.12
lot

9039.359 --> 9046.960000000001
yeah those things are only cool in the

9043.72 --> 9048.76
movies where they work in the movies

9046.96 --> 9052.358999999999
because it's a movie and the movie can

9048.76 --> 9055.800000000001
just say it's working yeah in reality it

9052.359 --> 9055.800000000001
doesn't it

9069.359 --> 9078.720000000001
sucks injectable speakers what the

9074.439 --> 9080.92
hell no you can just keep inserting that

9078.72 --> 9082.358999999999
stuff Angel Rose it's it's never going

9080.92 --> 9086.12
to happen

9082.359 --> 9089.880000000001
ever like it's not going to happen

9086.12 --> 9093.880000000001
yeah you can't like in the state this

9089.88 --> 9097.039999999999
world is in like that's never going to

9093.88 --> 9100.039999999999
happen yeah those kinds of things you

9097.04 --> 9101.640000000001
can attempt to introduce that when

9100.04 --> 9106.240000000002
things are doing

9101.64 --> 9110.319
well yeah everything is in disrepair

9106.24 --> 9113.76
yeah there isn't going to be a damn

9110.319 --> 9114.8
upgrade there isn't anything yeah a

9113.76 --> 9119.880000000001
bunch of

9114.8 --> 9121.438999999998
snobs and that's it it's like 1% of

9119.88 --> 9126.0
1%

9121.439 --> 9128.960000000001
might might do that and that's

9126.0 --> 9130.96
it most people aren't doing that and

9128.96 --> 9133.72
aren't going to do that and they don't

9130.96 --> 9137.278999999999
want to do

9133.72 --> 9140.438999999998
that actually the amount of people that

9137.279 --> 9143.640000000001
want that is going down

9140.439 --> 9146.84
because everybody is just noticing it

9143.64 --> 9149.16
sucks all the new [Â __Â ] sucks everything

9146.84 --> 9149.16
gets

9156.399 --> 9162.84
worse yeah this transhumanist vision of

9160.64 --> 9166.119999999999
oh we're going to be technological

9162.84 --> 9168.16
robots and it's all hor [Â __Â ] it's

9166.12 --> 9170.399000000001
complete a pipe

9168.16 --> 9172.56
dream nonsense

9170.399 --> 9174.88
it's not going to happen it isn't

9172.56 --> 9178.8
happening and those that are attempting

9174.88 --> 9178.8
to do it are being

9178.96 --> 9184.96
unsuccessful you

9182.399 --> 9187.76
understand you're just not clued up

9184.96 --> 9190.8
about it yeah I am it

9187.76 --> 9194.72
sucks most people think it sucks they

9190.8 --> 9197.679999999998
don't want it people that are using it

9194.72 --> 9200.519999999999
are not super happy about it

9197.68 --> 9201.16
because there's just so many problems

9200.52 --> 9203.560000000001
with

9201.16 --> 9206.16
it yeah whether it's just like

9203.56 --> 9208.319
functionality problems or health

9206.16 --> 9210.88
problems that come out of

9208.319 --> 9215.24
it like very

9210.88 --> 9218.119999999999
quickly yeah all this Tech upgrade [Â __Â ]

9215.24 --> 9220.52
sucks my comments will not age well oh

9218.12 --> 9220.52
yeah they

9224.279 --> 9231.68
will yeah there's been a

9228.319 --> 9234.56
saturation people don't want all this

9231.68 --> 9237.08
crap anymore except people that

9234.56 --> 9239.119999999999
literally will not survive because they

9237.08 --> 9241.72
don't have any

9239.12 --> 9243.52
sensibility if you have no sensibility

9241.72 --> 9246.84
you completely buy into this

9243.52 --> 9250.04
transhumanist fantasy of merging with

9246.84 --> 9252.399
machines yeah they might want it but

9250.04 --> 9255.84
they're literally going to be

9252.399 --> 9258.119999999999
dying like real transhumanist surrender

9255.84 --> 9261.84
is like they're not going to live very

9258.12 --> 9264.720000000001
long cuz they don't don't understand

9261.84 --> 9267.56
anything about the

9264.72 --> 9270.438999999998
body like they don't understand how it

9267.56 --> 9273.199999999999
really works at

9270.439 --> 9275.76
all they subject themselves to things

9273.2 --> 9277.16
that are unhealthy and they don't admit

9275.76 --> 9280.16
it to

9277.16 --> 9280.16
themselves

9280.52 --> 9288.960000000001
yeah it doesn't work it's the same crap

9285.2 --> 9290.52
as 10 years ago and 10 years before that

9288.96 --> 9293.358999999999
transum

9290.52 --> 9296.960000000001
technological merger dreams have been

9293.359 --> 9301.24
out there for decades and all the people

9296.96 --> 9305.96
that really got into it guess

9301.24 --> 9305.96
what yeah they're not doing very

9309.52 --> 9315.24
well yeah you know why because as soon

9312.479 --> 9318.519999999999
as you're stupid enough to actually take

9315.24 --> 9322.039999999999
that step and start doing these things

9318.52 --> 9324.720000000001
you get severe burdens on your health

9322.04 --> 9324.720000000001
and that's a

9334.2 --> 9338.76
fact my comment will age

9343.0 --> 9347.08
splendidly people and aimed at me yeah

9345.52 --> 9350.399000000001
it's at people

9347.08 --> 9353.0
aimed it's aimed at people that don't

9350.399 --> 9356.358999999999
care about living very

9353.0 --> 9356.359
long that's

9361.56 --> 9366.399
right not the target market the target

9364.08 --> 9368.279
market is people that are like very

9366.399 --> 9371.64
susceptible to

9368.279 --> 9373.24
luciferian seduction that are very

9371.64 --> 9375.24
easily going to be pulled oh you want to

9373.24 --> 9378.24
be the tip of the spear well all you

9375.24 --> 9381.92
have to do is basically Rob yourself of

9378.24 --> 9384.479
your own health and lifespan cut down by

9381.92 --> 9386.359
half and then yeah you can do that and

9384.479 --> 9389.679999999998
then you get sick and you die very

9386.359 --> 9392.92
quickly like within 10 years or five

9389.68 --> 9396.16
years yeah that's who that's aimed at

9392.92 --> 9398.479
yeah transhumanist surrender people that

9396.16 --> 9401.6
have no problem

9398.479 --> 9405.479
sacrificing their biological

9401.6 --> 9408.279
integrity that's who that's aimed

9405.479 --> 9410.438999999998
at that's what great grandpa said about

9408.279 --> 9411.880000000001
radio

9410.439 --> 9414.6
no they

9411.88 --> 9418.92
didn't and besides the damage that

9414.6 --> 9418.92
radios have caused is already

9421.96 --> 9428.16
happened like that's already happened

9424.319 --> 9431.16
the damage is already there

9428.16 --> 9431.16
yeah

9432.16 --> 9437.84
provably that's why these really big

9434.56 --> 9440.8
radio stations are like not in the

9437.84 --> 9444.0
middle of a city

9440.8 --> 9448.399
they're like in the middle of

9444.0 --> 9453.68
nowhere away from living areas because

9448.399 --> 9453.68
if you live right next to it you get

9454.12 --> 9462.04
sick yeah that's already known

9457.56 --> 9462.039999999999
yeah great grandpa was

9463.76 --> 9469.319
right that all these things are all

9466.319 --> 9469.319
legitimate

9476.439 --> 9484.68
yeah the thing about radio is Radio is

9480.56 --> 9488.08
all based on receiving and receiving a

9484.68 --> 9490.399
thing is not problematic it it doesn't

9488.08 --> 9493.479
hurt you you're just having an antenna

9490.399 --> 9499.278999999999
that's receiving whatever is out there

9493.479 --> 9499.278999999999
it's if you have to also send back

9500.12 --> 9505.720000000001
cuz then you have a

9502.359 --> 9510.439
sender right next to you and

9505.72 --> 9510.438999999998
that's what's actually making a bigger

9512.68 --> 9520.16
impact now technology is of course like

9516.2 --> 9522.76
refined this so that you can be closer

9520.16 --> 9525.319
to it without sustaining massive damage

9522.76 --> 9529.72
I mean if every mobile phone would have

9525.319 --> 9531.039999999999
like Radio Systems like those of 100

9529.72 --> 9534.438999999998
years

9531.04 --> 9536.720000000001
ago yeah everybody wouldn't survive for

9534.439 --> 9536.720000000001
very

9539.72 --> 9545.679999999998
long but still like with the sheer

9542.92 --> 9547.439
amount of this type of system everywhere

9545.68 --> 9549.399
with everybody having a mobile phone

9547.439 --> 9552.2
yeah there is just we are being bathed

9549.399 --> 9554.039999999999
in it it's not good for our health

9552.2 --> 9557.52
collectively it

9554.04 --> 9560.720000000001
isn't right it's just not acute enough

9557.52 --> 9563.960000000001
let people like Drop Dead in this spot

9560.72 --> 9566.64
that it's that yeah that you could lay

9563.96 --> 9569.358999999999
blame directly at the phone companies

9566.64 --> 9571.278999999999
Etc even though people are doing that

9569.359 --> 9575.0
because it's already known that

9571.279 --> 9575.0
indirectly this is not

9575.72 --> 9579.76
good so they get out of

9584.72 --> 9589.16
it but you were in the game losing

9586.92 --> 9591.359
internet access messed you up yeah

9589.16 --> 9595.24
that's that's

9591.359 --> 9595.24
right I'm not denying

9595.6 --> 9604.08
that but hey I'd like I like it wired

9600.8 --> 9604.08
wires everywhere is

9605.96 --> 9610.56
good I shouldn't be with my philosophy

9609.0 --> 9611.439
what the [Â __Â ] does that have to do with

9610.56 --> 9616.56
my

9611.439 --> 9616.56
connectivity what I shouldn't be using a

9616.72 --> 9621.16
phone this is [Â __Â ]

9626.24 --> 9630.439
I'd love to have land lines with

9628.319 --> 9633.119999999999
everything it's just the world doesn't

9630.439 --> 9633.12
work like that

9643.12 --> 9649.640000000001
anymore yeah and I'm going to use my

9645.72 --> 9652.599999999999
internet despite your objections to the

9649.64 --> 9652.599999999999
things that I've had to

9653.359 --> 9659.2
say radio is bad are you just trying to

9656.96 --> 9661.08
get kicked out of my chat here because I

9659.2 --> 9665.84
don't like your

9661.08 --> 9665.84
tone you're just being very [Â __Â ]

9676.76 --> 9681.84
here you're not objecting no you're just

9679.52 --> 9681.84
being

9704.92 --> 9710.88
obnoxious yeah and radio being bad that

9709.279 --> 9715.439
doesn't mean

9710.88 --> 9715.438999999998
anything like the damage is already

9715.96 --> 9722.479
done yeah as soon as all radio type

9720.52 --> 9725.399000000001
things everything everywhere would be

9722.479 --> 9729.8
turned off you would notice there would

9725.399 --> 9729.8
be a dramatic change like

9729.96 --> 9735.438999999998
dramatic it would actually

9733.08 --> 9737.72
up the amount of

9735.439 --> 9740.68
fertility I'm not even

9737.72 --> 9742.76
joking yeah because you can definitely

9740.68 --> 9746.64
argue I mean I don't have any direct

9742.76 --> 9750.359
proof for it that be since

9746.64 --> 9754.76
radio fertility worldwide has gone

9750.359 --> 9758.640000000001
down like there are certain percentages

9754.76 --> 9760.960000000001
of sperm and eggs that are just not

9758.64 --> 9764.358999999999
going to function because radio is

9760.96 --> 9767.72
disrupting their function

9764.359 --> 9771.16
yeah and then there is percentages that

9767.72 --> 9774.479
will still that will still function but

9771.16 --> 9776.68
I guarantee you that it's worked like

9774.479 --> 9779.438999999998
that that the overall introduction of

9776.68 --> 9779.439
radio has

9780.24 --> 9784.479
downed fertility and I'm not even

9782.72 --> 9787.92
talking about just humans I'm talking

9784.479 --> 9792.039999999999
about all

9787.92 --> 9795.8
life all of it like it's

9792.04 --> 9799.720000000001
disruptive and beings that are just by

9795.8 --> 9801.479
happen sense be are extra sens itive to

9799.72 --> 9804.24
it per

9801.479 --> 9810.319
nature like they won't even be able to

9804.24 --> 9810.319
be born yeah that's how that works

9828.38 --> 9831.56
[Music]

9851.439 --> 9855.76
right but we're already living with it

9853.64 --> 9857.72
the radio is there and all the mobile

9855.76 --> 9859.84
phones and everything is there so it's

9857.72 --> 9862.319
just there

9859.84 --> 9863.64
and it's having its influence and it's a

9862.319 --> 9866.8
negative

9863.64 --> 9868.92
influence on things as fertility and all

9866.8 --> 9872.759999999998
that it's just

9868.92 --> 9876.479
there it's an overall standard

9872.76 --> 9879.56
burden on every all biology it's just

9876.479 --> 9879.56
what it is and that's

9883.52 --> 9892.2
it but I guarantee you if for whatever

9887.88 --> 9895.08
reason it would all be stopped turn off

9892.2 --> 9897.560000000001
like some kind of system would be

9895.08 --> 9901.24
reimagined on how to accomplish

9897.56 --> 9904.119999999999
everything completely wired everywhere

9901.24 --> 9908.52
it would have a dramatically positive

9904.12 --> 9908.52
impact on the biology of all

9915.08 --> 9922.56
life what hello J good see you

9919.56 --> 9925.88
whoa all of it broke the same day

9922.56 --> 9925.88
that's that

9928.2 --> 9936.12
sucks L for three days yeah I can

9933.479 --> 9940.199999999999
imagine man how can it all break at the

9936.12 --> 9940.2
same time that's just crazy

9950.319 --> 9955.359
thought you were cursed yeah well I've

9952.08 --> 9958.0
kind of felt the same way like

9955.359 --> 9959.800000000001
that I'm just happy that I can still do

9958.0 --> 9961.479
streaming and that my internet hasn't

9959.8 --> 9964.039999999999
been cut off

9961.479 --> 9966.278999999999
yet even though I'm almost streaming for

9964.04 --> 9966.279
three

9968.479 --> 9975.64
hours do you ever dream of the future

9972.64 --> 9975.64
barely

10000.359 --> 10003.84
okay

10001.2 --> 10008.08
derer yeah that is kind of freaky I had

10003.84 --> 10008.08
those two a lot when I was younger

10023.12 --> 10028.160000000002
where did I hear about the infertility

10025.12 --> 10031.76
who knows where I heard about

10028.16 --> 10034.92
that don't quote me on that it's just a

10031.76 --> 10037.52
general statement like it's disruptive

10034.92 --> 10040.6
of

10037.52 --> 10043.880000000001
microbiome that's G said

10040.6 --> 10046.0
earlier and I'm assuming it is going to

10043.88 --> 10048.24
be disruptive on

10046.0 --> 10052.92
fertility to a

10048.24 --> 10056.52
degree cuz like certain beings will be

10052.92 --> 10059.8
not be able to handle it as well and so

10056.52 --> 10062.92
those beings will never even

10059.8 --> 10065.24
mature CU they will be like killed off

10062.92 --> 10068.279
by the influence before they can

10065.24 --> 10069.869999999999
actually become old enough to complain

10068.279 --> 10073.059000000001
about it for

10069.87 --> 10073.059000000001
[Music]

10099.72 --> 10104.278999999999
about the outbreak before it happens

10101.76 --> 10104.279
yeah there's no

10105.399 --> 10109.039999999999
outbreak before the

10110.359 --> 10116.16
simulation for the great medical

10113.399 --> 10119.278999999999
experiment yeah well I had Visions about

10116.16 --> 10119.279
it pretty

10119.319 --> 10125.439
detailed like a decade before it

10122.439 --> 10125.439
happened

10152.399 --> 10155.399
h

10165.84 --> 10170.880000000001
yeah duper that me too

10215.92 --> 10221.92
right anyway everybody listening please

10217.92 --> 10221.92
don't forget the it up

10222.12 --> 10228.560000000001
again that would be great hope you're

10225.08 --> 10230.72
all enjoying the show it's been kind of

10228.56 --> 10234.76
over the

10230.72 --> 10234.76
place I got six that's

10237.56 --> 10242.08
nice started to show out a little

10243.0 --> 10250.0
introspective then a baller came in and

10245.92 --> 10250.0
I did a little bit of a rant

10250.319 --> 10255.68
now we were talking about the influences

10252.2 --> 10259.239000000001
of electromagnetic frequency

10255.68 --> 10261.319
Ander try to make a case for

10259.239 --> 10264.039999999999
technological

10261.319 --> 10268.76
inevitability which I

10264.04 --> 10268.76
highly doubt that's going to

10269.88 --> 10275.88
work so that transhumanist technological

10273.399 --> 10280.239
surrender ISM has been out there

10275.88 --> 10280.239
forever for decades

10280.56 --> 10283.399
and it just never

10289.6 --> 10295.84
works remember you've seen something for

10292.359 --> 10300.880000000001
no I it's different like when you talk

10295.84 --> 10304.960000000001
about it in the past to people like I'm

10300.88 --> 10304.96
seeing this and this

10308.64 --> 10317.039999999999
it's not the same as remembering it when

10312.239 --> 10317.039999999999
you get to see it in the real in real

10317.84 --> 10324.6
time that's like a Deja Vu

10321.479 --> 10326.438999999998
experience I was warning about

10324.6 --> 10330.08
it

10326.439 --> 10330.08
like 10 years

10331.88 --> 10339.039999999999
ago like I became

10334.279 --> 10342.640000000001
extra alert to medical issues like

10339.04 --> 10345.080000000002
medical top down projects and all that

10342.64 --> 10348.599999999999
World Health Organization that kind of

10345.08 --> 10352.08
thing I was very alert on that partially

10348.6 --> 10352.08
because of that

10352.2 --> 10356.960000000001
vision and back then the like the

10354.92 --> 10358.6
medical institutes and all that that are

10356.96 --> 10363.08
into that sort of thing they were just

10358.6 --> 10366.6
about like oh swine flu and SARS and

10363.08 --> 10366.6
that kind of stuff

10369.479 --> 10374.72
can I say anything about the future now

10378.72 --> 10383.039999999999
no except for logical

10385.6 --> 10391.399000000001
implications but I mean at this point

10388.04 --> 10394.399000000001
like even with nothing new with nothing

10391.399 --> 10396.76
new the future I'm sorry to say it's

10394.399 --> 10399.08
looking pretty damn

10396.76 --> 10402.6
Grim it really is

10399.08 --> 10406.0
is like in general I mean for myself

10402.6 --> 10407.16
I'll be able to survive and all that if

10406.0 --> 10411.88
I don't go

10407.16 --> 10416.399
insane more than I already am

10411.88 --> 10419.519999999999
but in general for like Western Society

10416.399 --> 10419.519999999999
it's not looking

10419.68 --> 10425.439
good like really not good and despite a

10423.6 --> 10430.0
lot of things being worked on and

10425.439 --> 10433.64
pointed out like it's not stopping

10430.0 --> 10437.239
like this the detrial developments are

10433.64 --> 10442.0
just they just keep being imposed and

10437.239 --> 10442.0
they may be halted but they're not

10443.8 --> 10449.96
reversed it's like we lost the power to

10447.0 --> 10452.0
take the power

10449.96 --> 10454.56
back in

10452.0 --> 10457.2
ways and it's like oh all this

10454.56 --> 10459.119999999999
criminality that's happening in in these

10457.2 --> 10460.76
governments and with these

10459.12 --> 10464.720000000001
conspiring

10460.76 --> 10469.56
groups and it's like yeah what do we

10464.72 --> 10471.679999999998
do we don't know what to do nobody does

10469.56 --> 10477.199999999999
like yeah they did all these crimes so

10471.68 --> 10480.319
who's going to persecute them nobody

10477.2 --> 10481.479000000001
knows yeah the Judicial Systems are in

10480.319 --> 10487.319
on

10481.479 --> 10487.319
it nobody knows what to do about this

10488.8 --> 10494.438999999998
like we can't really stop them we can

10491.52 --> 10496.52
just kind of slow them down and that's

10494.439 --> 10498.880000000001
like the best we can get out of it is

10496.52 --> 10502.359
just like slow things down so that not

10498.88 --> 10504.88
more damage is done but we seem to be

10502.359 --> 10507.52
incapable and I'm talking very generic

10504.88 --> 10508.8
now very wide it's in people in

10507.52 --> 10511.359
government that are trying to do

10508.8 --> 10511.358999999999
something about

10512.04 --> 10516.560000000001
it where it's not being reversed the

10514.56 --> 10518.8
only thing that's being reversed is

10516.56 --> 10521.359
people's mentalities

10518.8 --> 10525.679999999998
so there is a more

10521.359 --> 10527.399000000001
clearcut shifting in in Consciousness

10525.68 --> 10529.76
splitting between the sleepers and the

10527.399 --> 10532.08
awakened and the awakened are

10529.76 --> 10534.6
getting more in

10532.08 --> 10536.12
numbers and the sleepers are basically

10534.6 --> 10541.279
turning

10536.12 --> 10543.76
evil but it's not halting the

10541.279 --> 10548.92
processes like the technocrats and all

10543.76 --> 10548.92
that are still in power

10549.0 --> 10555.56
the Communist marxists are still in

10552.84 --> 10557.72
power doing their thing and even though

10555.56 --> 10559.399
everybody hates it nobody wants it

10557.72 --> 10562.84
except those that are already enslaved

10559.399 --> 10566.039999999999
to it like they're not really being

10562.84 --> 10566.04
stopped or

10576.92 --> 10581.56
reversed if I can't see any future now

10579.68 --> 10585.56
we'll be able to see the future ever

10581.56 --> 10590.76
again I don't know I'm sorry I'm not an

10585.56 --> 10593.479
expert on the logic behind seeing in the

10590.76 --> 10595.800000000001
future Angel

10593.479 --> 10599.399
Rose like I'm not

10595.8 --> 10602.08
a a research like a psychological

10599.399 --> 10604.96
psionic researcher specifically

10602.08 --> 10608.6
specialized in knowledge about how

10604.96 --> 10611.239
seeing in the future works and how you I

10608.6 --> 10613.399000000001
don't know I just have some experiences

10611.239 --> 10613.399
with

10613.8 --> 10617.08
it that's

10624.64 --> 10629.88
it what if I'll do a show trying to

10627.96 --> 10632.358999999999
decipher people's dreams I've already

10629.88 --> 10632.358999999999
done that

10632.6 --> 10637.960000000001
duper if there's a lot of dreams that

10635.439 --> 10639.239
people get and that happens in phases

10637.96 --> 10642.358999999999
then

10639.239 --> 10644.92
they'll lay it on the table in the chat

10642.359 --> 10648.880000000001
and I will just start addressing it I

10644.92 --> 10648.88
have done that plenty of times in the

10649.76 --> 10654.0
past people get a lot of dreams all of a

10652.399 --> 10658.039999999999
sudden they're going to talk about it

10654.0 --> 10658.04
and then I will analyze it is what I

10666.88 --> 10671.239
do okay what are you talking

10689.52 --> 10695.279
about are you sure you got the right

10692.16 --> 10700.119999999999
duper pun I mean clearly there is like a

10695.279 --> 10700.12
fake duper sock account out there

10766.279 --> 10769.560000000001
well it looks like we're going to have a

10767.8 --> 10773.319
complete three-hour

10769.56 --> 10773.319
show isn't that just

10785.64 --> 10794.84
nice I guess more can fit on on

10789.439 --> 10798.2
this on this internet system than than I

10794.84 --> 10798.2
thought pretty

10801.96 --> 10807.599999999999
cool try to live here in the here and

10804.6 --> 10809.880000000001
the now yeah living in the past for a

10807.6 --> 10809.880000000001
long

10810.64 --> 10815.56
time it is hard yeah when you do that

10813.239 --> 10817.72
it's very hard to break out of it I'm

10815.56 --> 10819.519999999999
trying I'm trying the same thing right

10817.72 --> 10822.08
now

10819.52 --> 10825.16
right how I started out my show just the

10822.08 --> 10827.359
realization of hey oh that's why it's in

10825.16 --> 10829.359
the title if you're just going to be

10827.359 --> 10834.16
afraid of

10829.359 --> 10836.800000000001
something then you almost summon that

10834.16 --> 10839.16
thing you're

10836.8 --> 10842.479
justifying the cause of the fear and

10839.16 --> 10843.96
thereby potentially ask for it it's like

10842.479 --> 10845.16
oh you're afraid of this thing you're

10843.96 --> 10849.679999999998
afraid of this

10845.16 --> 10852.56
thing so then you're summoning that

10849.68 --> 10853.92
thing like logically if somebody is like

10852.56 --> 10857.0
completely

10853.92 --> 10858.88
indifferent like completely indifferent

10857.0 --> 10860.96
and you keep telling them I'm afraid of

10858.88 --> 10867.278999999999
this I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of

10860.96 --> 10867.278999999999
this there is a more than 50%

10867.92 --> 10874.439
chance that at some point the

10871.479 --> 10878.399
person that is completely indifferent

10874.439 --> 10880.880000000001
will kind of like

10878.399 --> 10880.88
talk

10881.88 --> 10889.519999999999
back and maybe like emphasize it or try

10886.2 --> 10892.319000000001
to conjure it so it's like if you're

10889.52 --> 10894.0
continually afraid about something the

10892.319 --> 10897.319
world's going to

10894.0 --> 10900.16
respond to reinforce the thing you're

10897.319 --> 10900.16
afraid of

10902.6 --> 10910.279
somehow yeah so being afraid justifies

10907.359 --> 10910.279
the cause of the

10912.359 --> 10916.279
fear maybe it's even

10917.72 --> 10924.64
manifest but justifies is like justifies

10922.319 --> 10924.64
and

10924.68 --> 10929.76
manifests but justifies is a is a better

10928.08 --> 10932.239
word to just start out with because it

10929.76 --> 10934.960000000001
doesn't the manifestation comes if you

10932.239 --> 10936.039999999999
really hold on to it this is an

10934.96 --> 10938.88
important

10936.04 --> 10941.479000000001
realization especially for myself right

10938.88 --> 10944.759999999998
now because I've been in a recent week

10941.479 --> 10948.16
like really hammering myself with

10944.76 --> 10951.2
certain types of fears that really took

10948.16 --> 10953.64
a heavy heavy toll on me to the point

10951.2 --> 10956.6
where at certain days I was so sick I

10953.64 --> 10961.319
couldn't eat anything for an entire

10956.6 --> 10965.479000000001
day so and I'm still like a little bit

10961.319 --> 10968.68
at like that but I mean not as bad as it

10965.479 --> 10970.679999999998
was hello Danny shakes by the way

10968.68 --> 10975.359
how am

10970.68 --> 10978.359
I I've been better but I'm holding in

10975.359 --> 10983.319
there today I'm doing pretty good thus

10978.359 --> 10983.319
far it's been an interesting show

11012.52 --> 11015.960000000001
right but I mean just to get back to

11014.239 --> 11018.8
what Richard he said like yeah if you're

11015.96 --> 11021.278999999999
stuck living in the past what you're

11018.8 --> 11024.039999999999
doing then when you're stuck in living

11021.279 --> 11027.279
in the past is you recreate the

11024.04 --> 11029.6
past for the reason that you want to

11027.279 --> 11033.960000000001
reex experiencing it and do better

11029.6 --> 11036.68
usually or fix it but by reliving the

11033.96 --> 11038.8
past you basically resummon it you

11036.68 --> 11042.960000000001
resummon the same

11038.8 --> 11046.64
situation and then you miss out on the

11042.96 --> 11050.839999999998
natural subsequent followup experience

11046.64 --> 11050.84
that you would get if you just let it

11052.72 --> 11059.519999999999
go by living by being stuck in the past

11056.239 --> 11061.92
you recreate the past

11059.52 --> 11065.68
and specifically the negative aspect of

11061.92 --> 11065.68
it that keeps you stuck

11068.08 --> 11074.92
there and that can be a very tough habit

11071.6 --> 11078.720000000001
to break out of but like it requires a

11074.92 --> 11080.960000000001
level of courage and more

11078.72 --> 11084.76
importantly you have to surrender you

11080.96 --> 11089.479
have to surrender to to avoid to a

11084.76 --> 11092.239
nothing to not having direct conscious

11089.479 --> 11094.72
control or seeming

11092.239 --> 11096.96
control and the the best way to describe

11094.72 --> 11099.8
that you have to trust God you have to

11096.96 --> 11103.199999999999
leave it open and just tell yourself

11099.8 --> 11106.88
like I don't know what's going to happen

11103.2 --> 11109.960000000001
but I trust it's going to be all

11106.88 --> 11112.599999999999
right and that's very that can be very

11109.96 --> 11115.199999999999
when you've held on and our cramped it's

11112.6 --> 11117.92
very hard to get to that point CU you're

11115.2 --> 11120.960000000001
all in the form where you're

11117.92 --> 11123.0
automatically going to like not do that

11120.96 --> 11125.278999999999
so you really have to like Let It Go

11123.0 --> 11128.2
relax and then you're going to feel

11125.279 --> 11131.720000000001
miserable and unprotected for a bit but

11128.2 --> 11134.640000000001
then just like unravel that and just

11131.72 --> 11137.76
look at the bigger picture look at the

11134.64 --> 11139.88
knowledge that God exists and that

11137.76 --> 11142.08
there's so much that's completely out of

11139.88 --> 11144.64
your control and oversight and yet

11142.08 --> 11149.64
things still work

11144.64 --> 11149.64
out in general there's a guiding

11153.16 --> 11162.279
force that helps thing things work

11158.84 --> 11165.439
up and we see that as

11162.279 --> 11167.880000000001
God in specific relation to the saying

11165.439 --> 11171.16
trust

11167.88 --> 11172.8
God trust the design like it's the only

11171.16 --> 11176.439
way to do

11172.8 --> 11179.199999999999
it but when you're in it's very

11176.439 --> 11180.960000000001
tough right and somebody might tell you

11179.2 --> 11184.880000000001
and then you'll be like oh it's not that

11180.96 --> 11187.72
simple but nobody said it's simple but

11184.88 --> 11191.96
it is what you what works

11187.72 --> 11196.039999999999
though like you have to make room room

11191.96 --> 11198.119999999999
for for to be able to be your stronger

11196.04 --> 11200.84
self you have to have that

11198.12 --> 11202.439
room and in order to get that room you

11200.84 --> 11206.8
need to

11202.439 --> 11210.04
let a lot of things go and then room

11206.8 --> 11212.199999999999
will come and you will restore to a

11210.04 --> 11217.04
higher functioning

11212.2 --> 11217.04
self but you got to let it go and trust

11225.76 --> 11232.08
God right and also

11228.64 --> 11235.479
like it's not a one-time

11232.08 --> 11239.52
process it's going to keep reoccurring

11235.479 --> 11239.519999999999
in your life as it is with me

11242.239 --> 11248.84
I have to just keep actively realizing

11244.92 --> 11248.84
this that like oh it's going to happen

11266.439 --> 11270.479000000001
again for

11307.56 --> 11313.88
right so yeah it's uh past 5 o' here

11310.56 --> 11317.359

11313.88 --> 11317.358999999999
