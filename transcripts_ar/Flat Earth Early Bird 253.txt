6.21 --> 36.289
[Music]

38.88 --> 46.510000000000005
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

42.58 --> 48.04
early-bird number 253 I'm your host

46.51 --> 49.72
Arwen and before we start the show

48.04 --> 51.879
please don't forget to share it on any

49.72 --> 53.89
platform you deem fit except Facebook

51.879 --> 54.94
and if you haven't already subscribed to

53.89 --> 56.59
my channel and hit that Bell

54.94 --> 58.66
notification so you know when I'm going

56.59 --> 63.370000000000005
live which is normally 2:00 p.m.

58.66 --> 65.08
Amsterdam time every day so please also

63.37 --> 67.87
support my show through super Chad's

65.08 --> 69.12
paypal patreon and my GoFundMe much

67.87 --> 71.47
obliged

69.12 --> 80.13000000000001
yeah good morning everyone

71.47 --> 82.5
it's the heart really really hot and

80.13 --> 85.03
also yeah

82.5 --> 88.75
there have been chemtrails you can even

85.03 --> 92.549
see some of them over there but it's

88.75 --> 96.91
almost like they seem to disperse pretty

92.549 --> 101.29
evenly into this weird slightly more

96.91 --> 103.21
whitish blue closer to the horizon but

101.29 --> 105.73
yeah when you look right above you you

103.21 --> 107.67999999999999
can barely even see it it's that hot I

105.73 --> 111.43
think the heat really has something to

107.68 --> 114.97000000000001
do with it so it seems like it's a blue

111.43 --> 119.4
sky but they're still yeah come through

114.97 --> 119.4
hey he's a little bit of it everywhere

119.43 --> 127.9
it's just so hard just sitting in front

125.23 --> 130.479
of my screen doing stuff eventually I

127.9 --> 137.34900000000002
catch myself just sweating sweating it's

130.479 --> 139.65900000000002
just so annoying so what I got some

137.349 --> 143.10899999999998
I got a lot of goodies today I got

139.659 --> 144.37
Tamera coffee of course tea I don't know

143.109 --> 146.59
if I'm gonna drink that though because

144.37 --> 147.519
it's way too hot really got some

146.59 --> 150.209
lemonade

147.519 --> 158.799
this time difference it's black berry

150.209 --> 163.23000000000002
lemonade really good so I'm probably

158.799 --> 167.43
gonna finish that bottle very quickly

163.23 --> 171.75
and on top of that super look serious I

167.43 --> 178.769
got what is it

171.75 --> 181.299
blueberries and strawberries I just

178.769 --> 183.459
couldn't leave it there I really had to

181.299 --> 185.889
get some of that it's like fresh

183.459 --> 190.769
strawberries this a long time ago since

185.889 --> 190.769
I had those I want this type of heat

201.47 --> 213.77
such a world of difference with

204.07 --> 218.32999999999998
strawberry tasting things hmm so let's

213.77 --> 220.85000000000002
see who is in chat today Steve was in

218.33 --> 223.24
Daniel had a back and forth them James

220.85 --> 223.23999999999998
Mason

226.78 --> 233.24
long back a fourth page a gemstone

230.57 --> 238.32999999999998
monkey 3d drunken bullet for one one Don

233.24 --> 239.93
Diego but MacLeod get a fish Zep tepi

238.33 --> 245.26000000000002
Amanda young

239.93 --> 245.26000000000002
I kill the hope on a bear pumpkin

247.69 --> 256.13
Elon Musk have no sphere oh yeah good to

253.22 --> 260.54
see you all so I'm probably gonna have

256.13 --> 267.68
dation on after I'm done talking my

260.54 --> 272.36
thing I have been digging again second

267.68 --> 275.93
day I've been digging into the into the

272.36 --> 279.83000000000004
Feynman lectures as they're called the

275.93 --> 282.89
intro to quantum mechanics and I'm

279.83 --> 287.02
starting to really badly notice a

282.89 --> 290.24
pattern and that is that it is

287.02 --> 295.13
absolutely doused in Einsteinian

290.24 --> 296.99
reasoning and it seems yeah now that I'm

295.13 --> 301.99
realizing this looking through the

296.99 --> 305.89
titles of the pages just apparent that

301.99 --> 308.42
pretty much 2/3 up to 3/4 is entirely

305.89 --> 311.57
Einstein Ian speculation based and a

308.42 --> 313.55
complete waste of time so I'm not gonna

311.57 --> 315.59
read the entire thing there's two more

313.55 --> 320.09000000000003
books beside that I hope they'll get

315.59 --> 321.02
into more real-world details because

320.09 --> 322.25
yeah

321.02 --> 324.71
so far it's been kind of a

322.25 --> 327.68
disappointment it's been interesting but

324.71 --> 330.02
then again it seems it really gave me

327.68 --> 333.62
the feeling so for like this is not his

330.02 --> 336.2
original book really like he had her

333.62 --> 338.6
original book and then it was basically

336.2 --> 341.18
shared like yeah this can't work you

338.6 --> 343.88
must we're not gonna publish it unless

341.18 --> 346.55
you put on Stein Ian's relations in

343.88 --> 350.59
there so he did that like afterwards I

346.55 --> 350.59000000000003
think that's what it feels like to me

356.24 --> 361.86
yeah

358.57 --> 361.86
now it's nonsense

365.39 --> 368.28999999999996
but

366.66 --> 371.92
[Music]

368.29 --> 374.74
yeah I will talk with Asian about it

371.92 --> 377.92
also was forwarded by Steve a couple of

374.74 --> 384.73
videos one about string theory that was

377.92 --> 387.45
just a giant mind [ __ ] huh it was kind

384.73 --> 390.79
of interesting but again it's just

387.45 --> 392.92
everything in these complicated fields

390.79 --> 395.77000000000004
in these fields just seem to be

392.92 --> 400.78000000000003
absolutely doused in Einsteinian

395.77 --> 403.18
[ __ ] it's everywhere it's got its

400.78 --> 405.60999999999996
hooks in everything like it's some sort

403.18 --> 407.8
of measuring stick that's supposedly

405.61 --> 416.8
important even though it's completely

407.8 --> 419.46000000000004
outside of tangible reality so that's

416.8 --> 419.46000000000004
worrisome

420.98 --> 426.67
and I wonder how yeah how far that'll go

431.86 --> 437.15000000000003
hmm

433.36 --> 438.62
in the end it may turn out that most of

437.15 --> 441.34999999999997
quantum mechanics could just be

438.62 --> 446.12
compacted in one little book because the

441.35 --> 449.59000000000003
rest is all Einsteinian [ __ ] that's

446.12 --> 449.59000000000003
probably what's gonna happen

458.01 --> 467.13
but at least what I do find really

461.52 --> 469.46999999999997
interesting is how supposedly through

467.13 --> 472.5
physics and everything it is reasoned

469.47 --> 477.74
out that all these energies are part of

472.5 --> 477.74
the same spectrum like theirs

479.06 --> 486.84
yeah they put all these things into

483.09 --> 488.59999999999997
classes and then light is pretty much in

486.84 --> 491.96999999999997
middle and on top of that comes

488.6 --> 498.36
radioactive things and for that radio

491.97 --> 499.89000000000004
and all these types of energy things now

498.36 --> 502.74
I'm not explaining it very well should

499.89 --> 505.97999999999996
probably show the diagram that was they

502.74 --> 508.52
showed a single diagram and then I

505.98 --> 511.92
immediately started thinking like really

508.52 --> 515.76
so that seems to be the case but is it

511.92 --> 519.39
actually or is it just what it looks

515.76 --> 522.03
like I wonder with so what they really

519.39 --> 525.33
do is they put down really nice stories

522.03 --> 528.87
and then it's almost like they break in

525.33 --> 532.5
like we know this and that certain

528.87 --> 534.8100000000001
things and then I'm thinking really how

532.5 --> 537.2
do you know that how do you know that

534.81 --> 540.2099999999999
for certain how do you know that mass

537.2 --> 541.8900000000001
increases when it approaches the speed

540.21 --> 544.23
of light that kind of thing how is that

541.89 --> 547.17
assumed that's just one example that I

544.23 --> 550.3100000000001
laid out yesterday but there's much more

547.17 --> 553.3499999999999
of that just these assumptions on which

550.31 --> 556.88
which are made supposedly important that

553.35 --> 563.82
that connection is put in there it's

556.88 --> 567.89
it's riddled with wizardry hey hello the

563.82 --> 567.8900000000001
one yeah I think I'll get you on

568.51 --> 573.81
oh yeah Oh God before I get you on I

570.91 --> 580.75
gotta show you something so ridiculous

573.81 --> 585.899
because for some reason what the hell is

580.75 --> 585.899
creak Meister Oh God

593.13 --> 598.76
okay

595.55 --> 598.76
[Music]

609.23 --> 614.88
right somebody calling themselves Creek

612.029 --> 619.019
Meister from Indiana just added me on

614.88 --> 625.11
skype tried to call me I don't know I

619.019 --> 627.2090000000001
was gonna have deja nom but first I want

625.11 --> 629.9300000000001
to share this right to hand comments

627.209 --> 632.8199999999999
because he Keith keeps on leaving

629.93 --> 636.12
comments in Skype like he's

632.82 --> 640.62
communicating but he's saying all these

636.12 --> 643.019
I don't know nasty things it's just and

640.62 --> 645.36
he keeps on talking like I already know

643.019 --> 647.399
I blocked him then I unlocked him to

645.36 --> 654.149
respond but I'm just leaving it open to

647.399 --> 657.74
because I find it so curious so just it

654.149 --> 657.74
calls me a fake flat earther

661.97 --> 668.0600000000001
and then he asks why I never do anything

664.43 --> 673.25
except My Morning Show never see you on

668.06 --> 674.29
a debate like yesterday never puts out a

673.25 --> 677.63
video

674.29 --> 679.9399999999999
well that is mostly true I do most of my

677.63 --> 683.86
things life and if I want to show

679.94 --> 683.86
something I'll show it on my life show

689.7 --> 696.57
what ok never make any content except

693.3 --> 701.4599999999999
you're rambling to the tune of potential

696.57 --> 703.9200000000001
super chat so that's interesting yeah I

701.46 --> 708.3000000000001
would like to test that so what would

703.92 --> 711.2099999999999
exactly what whatever I need to say to

708.3 --> 712.8
just make you donate super chats because

711.21 --> 716.0400000000001
I never really figured out any

712.8 --> 720.53
correlation so I wonder like how he

716.04 --> 723.81
concludes that I speak specifically to

720.53 --> 725.4599999999999
unleash unleash the super Jets of my

723.81 --> 728.55
audience that's fascinating it's a

725.46 --> 730.5
fascinating concept I want to know more

728.55 --> 732.54
maybe he sees something that I don't

730.5 --> 735.12
even know how to figure out and he's

732.54 --> 739.88
basically helping me without even

735.12 --> 742.71
realizing this not just kidding

739.88 --> 748.89
make a product or service and people

742.71 --> 753.75
will pay you to be you ok so what about

748.89 --> 756.5699999999999
my show where my product is my

753.75 --> 764.01
explanations and my views and my

756.57 --> 766.6500000000001
research and my analysis and some jokes

764.01 --> 770.39
I don't know it isn't that a product and

766.65 --> 773.97
aren't people willing to pay for it and

770.39 --> 779.48
I don't go outside of my comfort zone oh

773.97 --> 779.48
yeah like what

781.38 --> 790.57
what concerning at least what what

785.71 --> 793.72
concerning the show do I don't I get out

790.57 --> 796.21
of my comfort zone like because hey when

793.72 --> 799.69
it concerns my the rest of my life yeah

796.21 --> 802.5600000000001
he has some points but I openly admit

799.69 --> 806.4300000000001
that so it's been a big barrier for me

802.56 --> 809.0799999999999
to engage in the rest of the world but

806.43 --> 813.91
because of apparent reasons that I've

809.08 --> 816.339
also explained and yeah it's not like

813.91 --> 820.42
I'm proud of that or something but

816.339 --> 823.4100000000001
anyway yeah that he felt the need to say

820.42 --> 823.41
that yesterday night

832.96 --> 837.38
yeah

834.62 --> 840.65
all right and he suggests that where the

837.38 --> 846.83
magic things happens is far away from my

840.65 --> 850.31
comfort zone well normally I'd agree to

846.83 --> 852.59
that but I've already stepped very far

850.31 --> 855.38
away from many of my comfort zones in

852.59 --> 858.5
the last 20 years step by step slowly

855.38 --> 863.39
and I think that a lot of magic things

858.5 --> 866.6
happened in my life really even in the

863.39 --> 868.64
simple thing so yeah I'm taking this way

866.6 --> 873.23
too serious the guy's really desperate

868.64 --> 876.77
that just try to find something to to

873.23 --> 883.64
get under my skin it's like he really

876.77 --> 886.97
wants to make me stop you feel that like

883.64 --> 890.09
apparently me continuing and not

886.97 --> 892.46
stopping in my tracks hurts him so badly

890.09 --> 894.88
that he keeps on getting inspired to try

892.46 --> 896.5300000000001
to make these type of comments to

894.88 --> 899.24
discourage me

896.53 --> 902.15
supposedly genuine like a man to men

899.24 --> 908.14
like yeah this really isn't working out

902.15 --> 908.14
you know it's what a weird guy

914.529 --> 922.04
so yeah right dan that's that's my

918.35 --> 924.49
response to your your daily ramblings in

922.04 --> 924.49
my Skype

931.95 --> 949.26
okay I'm gonna talk I'm gonna call and

934.29 --> 952.92
Asian hey how ya doing great it hot

949.26 --> 957.18
though very hot here yeah it's cold here

952.92 --> 964.31
as well okay I'm trying to turn on my

957.18 --> 968.31
camera go camera go yeah it was on yeah

964.31 --> 975.779
all right yeah how you doing uh I'm on

968.31 --> 979.3199999999999
the YouTube page right yeah all right

975.779 --> 985.56
not fine I was just taking pictures of

979.32 --> 987.4490000000001
my cat sleeping at the Sun oh yeah do

985.56 --> 989.1899999999999
you have a bit of air conditioning or a

987.449 --> 992.75
cool spot in your home or is it all

989.19 --> 997.32
cooking the windows open

992.75 --> 998.329
yeah well so it so it is it here but

997.32 --> 1004.57
doesn't really matter

998.329 --> 1007.4899999999999
yeah right because my apartment has like

1004.57 --> 1009.1990000000001
my room is on one side of the block and

1007.49 --> 1010.97
then the the kitchen is on the other

1009.199 --> 1013.699
side so when you open all the doors and

1010.97 --> 1016.22
windows ah you got an air current nice

1013.699 --> 1018.62
yeah that helps yeah now the door is

1016.22 --> 1022.51
closed because of all the background

1018.62 --> 1022.51
noises around the rest of the apartment

1024.91 --> 1030.93
cool yeah I'm still cooking right here

1027.709 --> 1034.46
you might even see it it's just

1030.93 --> 1040.02
but yeah yeah yeah

1034.46 --> 1046.6200000000001
did you follow my my comments on the the

1040.02 --> 1049.62
the Feynman the Feynman talks Faymann

1046.62 --> 1050.9599999999998
lectures I'm really getting a bogey

1049.62 --> 1055.4099999999999
feeling about it

1050.96 --> 1056.79
like he was caught in a swamp like he's

1055.41 --> 1062.13
a bit of a swamp plant

1056.79 --> 1069.2
you know what Fane means right Fame yeah

1062.13 --> 1074.0100000000002
I think no Fame are the specific type of

1069.2 --> 1077.21
plant that yeah ground type that arrived

1074.01 --> 1081.6299999999999
that settles eventually in swamps oh

1077.21 --> 1084.27
it's a certain type of bog ground then

1081.63 --> 1087.69
they used to like dig it up and then dry

1084.27 --> 1089.87
it and burn it use it as fuel so it's

1087.69 --> 1094.01
all fame so the guy is literally called

1089.87 --> 1097.4099999999999
bog man basically that's kind of a sign

1094.01 --> 1101.55
like you know how that works with the

1097.41 --> 1103.17
names and he really does try to swamp

1101.55 --> 1106.49
you with all that and tiny and

1103.17 --> 1110.3600000000001
speculation is just 3/4 of everything

1106.49 --> 1115.08
yeah bending of space mind

1110.36 --> 1117.4499999999998
yeah but also like he he references it

1115.08 --> 1123.81
like that's really important that it

1117.45 --> 1127.53
that matches you know you see it right

1123.81 --> 1132.09
it is no story alright so it's really

1127.53 --> 1135.8899999999999
annoying at that and I don't know if I

1132.09 --> 1140.6699999999998
can read through the whole thing just

1135.89 --> 1143.25
well brief look but I was digging up to

1140.67 --> 1146.04
the quantum eraser delight choice

1143.25 --> 1149.34
experiment I was reading more technical

1146.04 --> 1152.6299999999999
details about it and then I just had

1149.34 --> 1158.9399999999998
that much time to give them more decent

1152.63 --> 1160.3000000000002
walk through what seems like a bit there

1158.94 --> 1162.73
there's some

1160.3 --> 1166.69
some some good stuff but then it's just

1162.73 --> 1170.53
covered with all the all the things we

1166.69 --> 1174.13
know like all the Estonian [ __ ]

1170.53 --> 1177.04
really so there's Einstein in at the

1174.13 --> 1179.3500000000001
core of John's argument as well yeah

1177.04 --> 1185.2
holy [ __ ] have you ever tried to point

1179.35 --> 1190.4499999999998
that out to him oh I think it's unknown

1185.2 --> 1193.15
did that with eBay specifically I think

1190.45 --> 1197.98
he was talking about how what his

1193.15 --> 1201.2800000000002
describing is connected lunchtime okay

1197.98 --> 1204.7
yeah but that's not

1201.28 --> 1206.44
yeah that's not specific enough yeah he

1204.7 --> 1209.98
needs to be told just like you said

1206.44 --> 1212.6200000000001
they're like if you can actually point

1209.98 --> 1215.01
at where if the foundations are resting

1212.62 --> 1217.8999999999999
on these are in Steinem and assumptions

1215.01 --> 1221.2
then you literally have something in his

1217.9 --> 1223.6000000000001
works to point that just so just saying

1221.2 --> 1228.5800000000002
it's not gonna cut it it's just gonna be

1223.6 --> 1237.9299999999998
insulted probably the thing is that they

1228.58 --> 1242.71
just principles a particle which is yep

1237.93 --> 1246.66
when was it measured and detected and

1242.71 --> 1250.75
like quantified well it was quantified

1246.66 --> 1252.94
not quantify quantified by the

1250.75 --> 1257.77
absorption of it the minimum absorption

1252.94 --> 1262.06
and then they simply assumed that that

1257.77 --> 1264.67
dot absorption would be the exchange of

1262.06 --> 1269.71
a singular particle because they

1264.67 --> 1272.89
couldn't find anything smaller that's

1269.71 --> 1275.3500000000001
that's kind of what I got from from

1272.89 --> 1277.21
everything I've heard by now that that's

1275.35 --> 1279.8799999999999
it that that is technically how they

1277.21 --> 1284.82
derived the particle the unit by the

1279.88 --> 1289.5400000000002
minimum quanta exchange rate with matter

1284.82 --> 1292.74
but that doesn't actually confirm that

1289.54 --> 1296.27
it is invisible because

1292.74 --> 1299.72
there there could be tests in how to

1296.27 --> 1304.46
establish whether that's the case or not

1299.72 --> 1307.65
by like reading quanta amounts that are

1304.46 --> 1311.309
bordering the minimum but are not there

1307.65 --> 1314.64
yet and then like spread it out like

1311.309 --> 1317.66
widen it out or compacted and just see

1314.64 --> 1320.4
when it starts to hit that critical mass

1317.66 --> 1322.8600000000001
but because of the nature of how you

1320.4 --> 1325.89
divide it and there's still the energy

1322.86 --> 1328.1699999999998
there the same amounts then these

1325.89 --> 1331.26
conclusions just must be drawn because

1328.17 --> 1333.3600000000001
they're not firing non particles that

1331.26 --> 1336.75
are not hitting it's just the same

1333.36 --> 1340.74
energy but to outspread not enough to

1336.75 --> 1344.309
actually trigger material to respond see

1340.74 --> 1347.28
it so that's one of the that's yeah this

1344.309 --> 1352.2
is a rough idea of how you could try to

1347.28 --> 1355.44
prove that you just described it's like

1352.2 --> 1357.38
if you take a bowl like say a football

1355.44 --> 1360.15
and it touch it against the wall that

1357.38 --> 1362.9
the part where the voltage is the ball

1360.15 --> 1366.9
is the actual size of the whole bowl

1362.9 --> 1370.2
it's just where it makes contact so you

1366.9 --> 1376.02
don't know which part of what you're

1370.2 --> 1378.48
detecting which part of what it's like

1376.02 --> 1382.62
when you ride your bike your tires like

1378.48 --> 1386.54
say works like I don't know what's the

1382.62 --> 1390.59
actual size of the bike tires like

1386.54 --> 1393.8999999999999
mine's are 26 but on the on the ground

1390.59 --> 1399.09
the tire is touching the last fall you

1393.9 --> 1401.8500000000001
just look like a width of let's say 2

1399.09 --> 1405.809
centimeters so that's not the actual

1401.85 --> 1408.6599999999999
size of the tire it's like when they

1405.809 --> 1412.76
detect something they can be detecting a

1408.66 --> 1412.76
small part of something bigger

1413.0 --> 1420.26
well what yeah what is established

1417.87 --> 1424.53
pretty much is there is light hitting

1420.26 --> 1426.24
matter that responds chemically or like

1424.53 --> 1429.8899999999999
electromagnetically

1426.24 --> 1432.42
creates an effect that is detectable and

1429.89 --> 1436.22
then it's simply measuring the amount of

1432.42 --> 1441.8700000000001
energy required in order to trigger that

1436.22 --> 1444.18
but if that is established by yeah just

1441.87 --> 1447.06
simply finding the minimum amount of

1444.18 --> 1449.79
energy and then firing that and

1447.06 --> 1455.97
presuming that's a unit or whether you

1449.79 --> 1459.1499999999999
try to just fire like multiple yeah just

1455.97 --> 1462.77
irradiate that light energy and then try

1459.15 --> 1465.42
to bend it spread it out to basically

1462.77 --> 1469.2
lessen the amount of energy quanta that

1465.42 --> 1473.3400000000001
will eventually reach the material then

1469.2 --> 1476.94
it might not be so conclusive what's

1473.34 --> 1479.01
going on because it will just become

1476.94 --> 1481.14
apparent that they're still light going

1479.01 --> 1484.08
there it's simply not enough to trigger

1481.14 --> 1486.5400000000002
the reaction but it can definitely be

1484.08 --> 1488.87
determined to go there so how can light

1486.54 --> 1491.97
be there and yet leave no particle

1488.87 --> 1495.9899999999998
prints see that that doesn't make any

1491.97 --> 1498.69
sense yeah you're right and then there's

1495.99 --> 1501.78
the thing that about the quantum eraser

1498.69 --> 1504.3300000000002
the delayed choice the B that I sent to

1501.78 --> 1507.74
you and went on it was discussed that

1504.33 --> 1512.46
sometimes the detectors were fired and

1507.74 --> 1516.53
who get fired by less than the prompt

1512.46 --> 1522.3500000000001
amount needed to detect the photon Wow

1516.53 --> 1525.47
mm-hmm yeah so so it's

1522.35 --> 1529.86
they're not actual hundred percent

1525.47 --> 1532.6200000000001
accurate those results and just like

1529.86 --> 1534.4799999999998
they planted a flag like yeah we're

1532.62 --> 1536.58
going to determine that this is an

1534.48 --> 1539.73
accurate reading and this is the eval

1536.58 --> 1543.51
plant the flag poop that's a quanta

1539.73 --> 1544.38
that's the particle of light yeah

1543.51 --> 1547.59
exactly

1544.38 --> 1551.43
and in the beginning when it's explained

1547.59 --> 1553.34
how they run the argon laser through the

1551.43 --> 1559.91
double slits and then you have this

1553.34 --> 1566.27
better be all crystal that equals

1559.91 --> 1568.45
equals out let's say the diffraction and

1566.27 --> 1569.72
so it sends what they call two entangled

1568.45 --> 1576.6100000000001
photons

1569.72 --> 1581.27
so from 351 nanometers gets it up to 700

1576.61 --> 1584.5
something so that's like when you use a

1581.27 --> 1586.73
candle to make the double slit

1584.5 --> 1588.62
experiment you have to get it through

1586.73 --> 1591.98
one slit first to make it monochromatic

1588.62 --> 1594.02
or to get one wavelength and then you

1591.98 --> 1596.059
get it through the double slit and it's

1594.02 --> 1598.07
the same here you fire a laser through a

1596.059 --> 1603.86
double-slit but then you run it through

1598.07 --> 1607.9089999999999
a BB old crystal which then has an

1603.86 --> 1610.549
effect on the actual laser so I would

1607.909 --> 1614.21
think that it's more changes the line

1610.549 --> 1616.1
effect yeah so I think what did it's

1614.21 --> 1618.38
really because now I serve like a

1616.1 --> 1620.51
present like that's interesting firing a

1618.38 --> 1623.3600000000001
prison through a double-slit I'm very

1620.51 --> 1625.34
curious what will happen well I've

1623.36 --> 1628.1899999999998
looked for a crystal like that and I

1625.34 --> 1630.86
found one so I'm now ordering so when I

1628.19 --> 1639.1100000000001
start the experiments when I build a

1630.86 --> 1642.28
vacuum chamber oh wow dude they're not

1639.11 --> 1646.52
expensive really yeah they're cheap

1642.28 --> 1652.19
something like point to you or something

1646.52 --> 1654.08
for a like small crystal oh the crystal

1652.19 --> 1659.6000000000001
right now I thought it was referencing

1654.08 --> 1662.059
the vacuum chamber and I'm just getting

1659.6 --> 1666.02
the I will make it the see-through so

1662.059 --> 1671.78
I'm using Lexie glass or what we call it

1666.02 --> 1675.23
exactly the see-through thick plastic

1671.78 --> 1680.6
thing it's a plexiglass I think or maybe

1675.23 --> 1683.419
C or yeah lexapro gives your Plexiglas

1680.6 --> 1686.03
PVC is more flexible yeah

1683.419 --> 1689.5700000000002
Oh actually glasses like the stuff that

1686.03 --> 1693.32
does break yeah yeah there's thick ones

1689.57 --> 1696.87
as well like one inch thick

1693.32 --> 1699.12
so make it out of that so I can run our

1696.87 --> 1700.9499999999998
tests and set it as well so it's

1699.12 --> 1702.81
interesting when you fire the laser

1700.95 --> 1707.91
through a double-slit and then clear the

1702.81 --> 1709.11
crystal and then set the the plate on

1707.91 --> 1712.26
the back and see what kind of

1709.11 --> 1714.9299999999998
diffraction we have from that alone and

1712.26 --> 1719.07
then like deal with the rest because

1714.93 --> 1721.8
what I'm thinking is that this is if you

1719.07 --> 1724.4099999999999
have a simple diffraction pattern from a

1721.8 --> 1726.72
laser or double slit and if you're

1724.41 --> 1729.18
looking at it with your eyes and when

1726.72 --> 1730.71
you cross your eyes you know when you

1729.18 --> 1734.16
point your both eyes to your most

1730.71 --> 1737.91
know-how what you see gets split in two

1734.16 --> 1740.76
yes and I think this is what actually

1737.91 --> 1743.16
the crystal is doing to the to the

1740.76 --> 1745.11
diffraction pattern and that's why

1743.16 --> 1747.15
they're getting those results because

1745.11 --> 1748.86
later when I checked later in the video

1747.15 --> 1751.95
how they did so it's almost like an

1748.86 --> 1754.5
focusing yeah it's like are you saying

1751.95 --> 1758.52
that the apparent wave pattern is

1754.5 --> 1765.78
basically an apparent effect that is the

1758.52 --> 1768.87
result of unfocus another ants were you

1765.78 --> 1772.02
know like the original black box camera

1768.87 --> 1775.08
that very bit not even with real lenses

1772.02 --> 1779.6399999999999
or like one lens that's basically how it

1775.08 --> 1782.76
got invented so the double slit effect

1779.64 --> 1785.5800000000002
ripple effect is a nun focusing effect

1782.76 --> 1788.94
and unfocus in transfer from what is

1785.58 --> 1790.5
transferred from the light is that how

1788.94 --> 1795.66
it could be considered that's really

1790.5 --> 1798.27
fascinating well I'm not sure but I'm

1795.66 --> 1803.64
really having my doubts about this whole

1798.27 --> 1806.55
experiment it seems very very unclear

1803.64 --> 1810.9
and it's the lack of information about

1806.55 --> 1813.09
it it's pretty unusual well now that you

1810.9 --> 1816.3000000000002
mention it there should be many

1813.09 --> 1818.79
follow-up tests there's so many things

1816.3 --> 1821.19
you could do to figure out what is the

1818.79 --> 1823.79
light doing by altering the way it is

1821.19 --> 1827.53
approaching or leaving the double slits

1823.79 --> 1830.6599999999999
prisms and all kinds of things

1827.53 --> 1834.559
just surrounding around that concept to

1830.66 --> 1838.5400000000002
see how light actually gets to the other

1834.559 --> 1838.54
side with all these things in the way

1839.32 --> 1846.049
another thing I was trying to find the

1842.51 --> 1848.21
technical now that was specification

1846.049 --> 1851.03
about all the equipment deals like the

1848.21 --> 1854.419
detectors and the mirrors and so on and

1851.03 --> 1856.7
I'm really finding it hard to find out

1854.419 --> 1860.2700000000002
what kind of detectors they use for the

1856.7 --> 1864.1100000000001
collapse of the wave function so I want

1860.27 --> 1866.96
to see what what type of effect this

1864.11 --> 1870.82
will have from the light so when they

1866.96 --> 1875.929
run the experiments of mostly electrical

1870.82 --> 1878.3899999999999
no idea I think it was electrical how

1875.929 --> 1881.419
they did that supposedly I thought that

1878.39 --> 1883.64
this is like a vague memory from one

1881.419 --> 1885.5
answer I heard somewhere 20 years ago

1883.64 --> 1889.3600000000001
once when I didn't really understand it

1885.5 --> 1893.679
so but I think they measured it with

1889.36 --> 1897.4399999999998
something electronic like some kind of

1893.679 --> 1900.41
electrical pulse because how else are

1897.44 --> 1902.5
you gonna stablish the location of such

1900.41 --> 1906.8600000000001
a small thing

1902.5 --> 1909.049
yeah yeah exactly but so that's that we

1906.86 --> 1911.36
need some more digging up and when I

1909.049 --> 1914.51
figure what I figured out is that first

1911.36 --> 1916.82
I need to run the experiment and not

1914.51 --> 1918.83
thinking the ways that it said that you

1916.82 --> 1920.809
should run it but try and vary the

1918.83 --> 1923.12
distances between the laser the slits

1920.809 --> 1924.3799999999999
and the plate where you get the

1923.12 --> 1928.3999999999999
diffraction because this will determine

1924.38 --> 1931.0700000000002
a lot of things and basically everywhere

1928.4 --> 1933.77
they tell you do it from this certain

1931.07 --> 1936.049
distance and exactly what one experiment

1933.77 --> 1940.76
I want to try and see what happens so I

1936.049 --> 1945.23
know what I'm observing me what can

1940.76 --> 1947.809
influence what I'm observing so move or

1945.23 --> 1950.63
changing the distance between the the

1947.809 --> 1954.3799999999999
background and the slits I think will be

1950.63 --> 1956.3300000000002
very significant information see how the

1954.38 --> 1958.75
pattern will change because of the

1956.33 --> 1958.75
distance

1959.09 --> 1966.27
yep so it's basically it's more of

1963.54 --> 1968.94
testing the medium or the actual gases I

1966.27 --> 1970.95
think that they're conducting discharge

1968.94 --> 1974.01
from the laser to the plate and not like

1970.95 --> 1976.92
the actual laser it's more of a test in

1974.01 --> 1979.3799999999999
the medium and checking out how or how

1976.92 --> 1983.5700000000002
does the medium behave well you could

1979.38 --> 1988.3500000000001
say it's figuring out light turbulence

1983.57 --> 1990.78
yeah yeah like how does light move in

1988.35 --> 1993.27
complicated scenarios because yeah in

1990.78 --> 1995.1299999999999
air pressure differentials and

1993.27 --> 1997.46
turbulence that's also pretty complex

1995.13 --> 1999.66
but that's purely on the pressures and

1997.46 --> 2001.97
temperatures and this is concerning

1999.66 --> 2004.19
light but it it pretty much comes down

2001.97 --> 2010.45
to trying to figure out those patterns

2004.19 --> 2017.24
which happen to have a fractal nature's

2010.45 --> 2020.3500000000001
in general these good time for the

2017.24 --> 2024.44
pictures of they send you on skype oh

2020.35 --> 2028.37
yeah yeah so the the double the

2024.44 --> 2030.41
lightning first I think the the video

2028.37 --> 2032.78
that we watched about the slow-motion

2030.41 --> 2034.97
white mixing our defects in the

2032.78 --> 2042.23
beginning and then yeah I'm presenting

2034.97 --> 2046.22
it yeah how lightning looks as if it'll

2042.23 --> 2048.64
just some digital device the previous

2046.22 --> 2048.64
picture

2054.129 --> 2074.659
damnit can you go to the previous

2061.19 --> 2077.149
picture sure I guess no and there are

2074.659 --> 2079.6690000000003
not something Randy said yeah this one

2077.149 --> 2083.0
you want that yeah this one I just

2079.669 --> 2086.3889999999997
wanted to mention something about this

2083.0 --> 2089.0
picture no not the Riley

2086.389 --> 2095.839
oh you're watching around the youtubes

2089.0 --> 2100.63
so you're like yeah a second slide so

2095.839 --> 2103.339
the strike from the lightning which is

2100.63 --> 2105.859
scream like 28,000 frames or something

2103.339 --> 2109.339
so in the beginning on the left side it

2105.859 --> 2110.54
starts from a single source and as you

2109.339 --> 2112.819
can see I Charles

2110.54 --> 2115.52
yeah traveling through the minimum it's

2112.819 --> 2119.5099999999998
actually getting deflected as like this

2115.52 --> 2122.39
so I think that's all the fraction is

2119.51 --> 2127.94
just a quality of the medium when

2122.39 --> 2129.859
transferring a amount of church whatever

2127.94 --> 2132.41
right you think the lightning is the

2129.859 --> 2135.799
frag I thought we discussed that it is

2132.41 --> 2138.44
basically like a point of tension the

2135.799 --> 2140.869
attention is increasing the charge is

2138.44 --> 2144.98
building and then it expands like a

2140.869 --> 2147.38
bubble and as it expands the charge

2144.98 --> 2149.27
basically crawls through that expansion

2147.38 --> 2152.42
and that's why it branches out like it

2149.27 --> 2154.609
does and then eventually when it touches

2152.42 --> 2156.77
the earthing on the other side that's

2154.609 --> 2158.93
when the second part of the picture the

2156.77 --> 2161.71
crawly lightning goes away and suddenly

2158.93 --> 2164.96
a single strike to the shortest point

2161.71 --> 2166.9700000000003
right and the lightning itself in the

2164.96 --> 2169.88
even the crawly lightning and the final

2166.97 --> 2173.859
strike are basically the chemical

2169.88 --> 2176.96
reaction side effect from the actual

2173.859 --> 2179.7799999999997
electrical tension that goes through it

2176.96 --> 2181.46
that sets of the gases like a chain

2179.78 --> 2184.4900000000002
reaction from the pure entity but it's

2181.46 --> 2185.839
an after effect because the Lightning

2184.49 --> 2187.9689999999996
itself is

2185.839 --> 2192.049
yeah in my opinion yeah it is like a

2187.969 --> 2196.549
field and it's basically instantaneous

2192.049 --> 2199.309
any type of real tension structure it's

2196.549 --> 2201.38
like that the field could grow but any

2199.309 --> 2205.13
tension structure is basically

2201.38 --> 2207.619
instantaneous and anytime you see a

2205.13 --> 2210.739
delay in lightning it's not the tension

2207.619 --> 2213.2290000000003
that is traveling at a slow speed no

2210.739 --> 2216.17
it's actually the chemical reaction that

2213.229 --> 2218.7189999999996
follows that has to follow a chain

2216.17 --> 2221.119
reaction and that can only go as a

2218.719 --> 2222.92
philosophy it can manifest instantly it

2221.119 --> 2225.259
has to start somewhere and from that

2222.92 --> 2228.289
point where the chemical reaction that

2225.259 --> 2233.41
causes the light starts that is where it

2228.289 --> 2238.1890000000003
will expand from that's that seem right

2233.41 --> 2241.269
yeah so I just wanted to compare that so

2238.189 --> 2244.969
as the Lightning starts and goes down

2241.269 --> 2247.999
it's actually what's happening through

2244.969 --> 2252.739
the slit but just here is the natural

2247.999 --> 2255.799
the natural slits of the air so because

2252.739 --> 2259.039
it's it's not like that the charge has

2255.799 --> 2261.439
the specific path as the laser does shot

2259.039 --> 2265.009
in one single direction and controlled

2261.439 --> 2267.6499999999996
it's just this is expanding through the

2265.009 --> 2271.88
air and yes rectum so the actual

2267.65 --> 2274.9390000000003
branching it's a sign thing it's a

2271.88 --> 2277.219
quality of the air it's a chemical

2274.939 --> 2279.499
reaction side effect but the actual

2277.219 --> 2281.689
thing that is really manifesting there

2279.499 --> 2284.6299999999997
is a tension field that like a bubble

2281.689 --> 2286.549
expands yeah and within the bubble the

2284.63 --> 2291.199
chemical reaction like roots spring

2286.549 --> 2293.15
forth yeah but I just want to make the

2291.199 --> 2297.949
comparison that this is the same thing

2293.15 --> 2302.39
what's happening in the double slit the

2297.949 --> 2304.429
double slit but how well if you imagine

2302.39 --> 2309.5589999999997
that this lightning on the left is the

2304.429 --> 2311.989
laser and just shooting the laser down

2309.559 --> 2314.929
through the slits diffracting it if you

2311.989 --> 2316.699
have a plate on you see all the branches

2314.929 --> 2319.549
and all the differences just the scale

2316.699 --> 2320.31
is too different but it's all the same

2319.549 --> 2322.83
mechanism

2320.31 --> 2325.34
going through the same here that just

2322.83 --> 2328.49
the amount of charge is different and

2325.34 --> 2333.56
it's a bit more violent in the lightning

2328.49 --> 2337.2
but I don't know because lightning

2333.56 --> 2341.82
obviously has two separate effects and

2337.2 --> 2343.62
light doesn't really have that you know

2341.82 --> 2346.8
there's two counter pros - the

2343.62 --> 2349.25
polarization and the transition of the

2346.8 --> 2351.75
polarization the evening out of it

2349.25 --> 2353.28
tension building and then the release

2351.75 --> 2357.33
that's what the lightning does well

2353.28 --> 2361.17
light is pretty much it just spawns into

2357.33 --> 2363.6
being is a constant that's why we need

2361.17 --> 2367.23
to go I knew you say that that's why I

2363.6 --> 2369.06
made the second picture so I will

2367.23 --> 2371.34
explain this now because with the

2369.06 --> 2374.13
lighting it's a big amount of charge

2371.34 --> 2376.65
coming from two places two different

2374.13 --> 2380.34
charges connecting and light is actually

2376.65 --> 2382.7400000000002
a much smaller charge which doesn't have

2380.34 --> 2384.9300000000003
this potential so it won't react that

2382.74 --> 2387.33
violently when it meets another charge

2384.93 --> 2390.5699999999997
for example it's with the laser just one

2387.33 --> 2394.71
wavelength there is not a build-up or

2390.57 --> 2396.96
anything that creates this huge shot but

2394.71 --> 2399.51
as you can see from a Tesla coil here on

2396.96 --> 2403.26
the left in the tree roots on the right

2399.51 --> 2405.42
is just the speed that the electricity

2403.26 --> 2408.0
will travel through a medium it will

2405.42 --> 2410.4
actually is constructing the path so

2408.0 --> 2411.15
when you have the charge in slowly with

2410.4 --> 2416.01
the earth

2411.15 --> 2418.29
it's scraping down the the the the the

2416.01 --> 2420.6600000000003
bath and the diffraction occurring it's

2418.29 --> 2422.49
why you get the branching that's why I

2420.66 --> 2425.16
say that the branching is the quality of

2422.49 --> 2428.04
the medium or the diffraction report the

2425.16 --> 2429.7799999999997
medium so it kind of makes sense like

2428.04 --> 2431.7599999999998
even with the last picture you put in

2429.78 --> 2433.9100000000003
there they've been presenting that

2431.76 --> 2438.15
lightning is very much like a branch

2433.91 --> 2439.68
because as with the lightning that is

2438.15 --> 2442.29
crawling it's not actually that

2439.68 --> 2445.44
lightning it's the field that is

2442.29 --> 2448.31
expanding and feeling out as it works

2445.44 --> 2452.19
the roots do the same thing they are

2448.31 --> 2453.97
reaching out and basically the actual

2452.19 --> 2457.2400000000002
route follows in its

2453.97 --> 2461.41
growth in all directions trying to find

2457.24 --> 2464.29
the the other the connection so the

2461.41 --> 2467.71
growth is very much slower but it's

2464.29 --> 2471.46
basically following similar natural

2467.71 --> 2476.859
fractal patterns like an expanding

2471.46 --> 2480.04
bubble it's it's very uncanny how much

2476.859 --> 2481.66
it looks like I think what's happening

2480.04 --> 2484.57
with the laser in the doubles that is

2481.66 --> 2487.5099999999998
exactly the same that's why when you

2484.57 --> 2492.6400000000003
show the single point laser through a

2487.51 --> 2495.75
slit gets its diffracting so because

2492.64 --> 2499.8399999999997
it's following down different paths so

2495.75 --> 2501.34
but it's just like straighter than in

2499.84 --> 2503.7400000000002
what we see in lighting because it's

2501.34 --> 2505.33
different type of charge but it's still

2503.74 --> 2507.4599999999996
electrical in nature

2505.33 --> 2509.56
it's from the electromagnetic spectrum

2507.46 --> 2512.89
which is all the same it's just

2509.56 --> 2515.5
wavelength yeah but I that is a

2512.89 --> 2517.24
connection you are very easy to make and

2515.5 --> 2518.98
that is where I'd like to where I

2517.24 --> 2523.24
basically start to contest because I

2518.98 --> 2526.53
really do believe that the effects and

2523.24 --> 2529.18
the overall manifestation of light are

2526.53 --> 2531.73
they are kind of like dipping in the

2529.18 --> 2534.19
same source as general electricity and

2531.73 --> 2539.56
magnetism but they're very different

2534.19 --> 2542.08
it's really not it it's not one is not

2539.56 --> 2545.67
that these literal same end of the other

2542.08 --> 2548.71
thing but they all tap on the same

2545.67 --> 2552.099
foundations as it were do you understand

2548.71 --> 2555.28
because I do electricity and light are

2552.099 --> 2558.19
not the same thing absolutely not I

2555.28 --> 2566.23
think I think it's just electricity is a

2558.19 --> 2569.56
very small portion of light no but it's

2566.23 --> 2572.56
not really comparable because look in

2569.56 --> 2574.589
these giant lightning things we both

2572.56 --> 2576.88
agree it's the chemical reaction

2574.589 --> 2579.07
proceeding from the tension going

2576.88 --> 2581.65
through that material that is then

2579.07 --> 2583.839
causing lights and is an extra effect

2581.65 --> 2587.5
it's a chemical effect from the tension

2583.839 --> 2588.54
so how is that tension then in any way

2587.5 --> 2591.15
resume

2588.54 --> 2594.75
the effect of light because it's

2591.15 --> 2597.75
basically not visible light is it's per

2594.75 --> 2600.51
definition what is visibility visibility

2597.75 --> 2604.26
exists because of light and you can't

2600.51 --> 2606.2900000000004
say the same for electricity well well

2604.26 --> 2608.9700000000003
the difference is that the charge would

2606.29 --> 2612.42
the lightning strike is just a huge

2608.97 --> 2615.9599999999996
charge which is not equally dispersed in

2612.42 --> 2618.84
a even field and it's a very small part

2615.96 --> 2622.38
of the electromagnetic spectrum as like

2618.84 --> 2625.3500000000004
this fully electric right well maybe

2622.38 --> 2628.32
look the I would agree especially after

2625.35 --> 2630.27
my analogy of the bubble expanding as

2628.32 --> 2635.1800000000003
the tension are seeking it's all polar

2630.27 --> 2638.94
opposite that light in a way does also

2635.18 --> 2643.2599999999998
more literally just move around in all

2638.94 --> 2646.53
directions and spread out equally as the

2643.26 --> 2650.01
medium allows it so in a way it doesn't

2646.53 --> 2652.59
crawl its way through it's just but it

2650.01 --> 2656.1600000000003
does like a bubble expand in the same

2652.59 --> 2660.1200000000003
way but as the electricity does that

2656.16 --> 2662.3999999999996
purely invisible it does and every

2660.12 --> 2664.95
visible aspect about it will be a side

2662.4 --> 2667.5
effect not the main effect itself light

2664.95 --> 2669.39
is exactly the opposite it is per

2667.5 --> 2673.53
definition what is visible and that

2669.39 --> 2676.47
makes it so different see what I mean

2673.53 --> 2679.26
yeah but still don't forget that when

2676.47 --> 2682.62
the electricity spike is in its highest

2679.26 --> 2684.8700000000003
then it starts the branching we start

2682.62 --> 2687.12
seeing the lights oh yes what is that

2684.87 --> 2690.14
that is not is that light the

2687.12 --> 2694.47
electricity or is it the matter

2690.14 --> 2697.46
responding reacting well I think it both

2694.47 --> 2700.35
cases it's only the matter or the

2697.46 --> 2706.28
connects okay let me ask it this way can

2700.35 --> 2706.2799999999997
electricity cause light in a vacuum

2708.4 --> 2714.64
well if if you take for example the

2712.45 --> 2717.069
vacuum chamber and you have let's say

2714.64 --> 2720.91
two bolts and run like a high frequency

2717.069 --> 2725.579
or a high voltage you get a certain

2720.91 --> 2730.45
amount of plasma which has some color

2725.579 --> 2734.319
but I mean in the pure vacuum itself so

2730.45 --> 2737.98
not something in the vacuum but like as

2734.319 --> 2740.049
two points and in between is literally

2737.98 --> 2742.69
vacuum and an amp of the electricity in

2740.049 --> 2746.47
it until there's a connection and yet

2742.69 --> 2750.2200000000003
then what happens do you see a spark

2746.47 --> 2753.8489999999997
that would have death that must at some

2750.22 --> 2756.0389999999998
point manifest or don't you see a spark

2753.849 --> 2757.65
is it dependent on the atmosphere

2756.039 --> 2761.65
lighting up or does electricity

2757.65 --> 2764.079
literally do its own thing I think it's

2761.65 --> 2767.6800000000003
a purely dependent on the atmosphere

2764.079 --> 2772.7490000000003
right so then electricity can never be

2767.68 --> 2776.23
visible by by itself yeah just so one

2772.749 --> 2780.069
when it gets to this critical charge

2776.23 --> 2785.0190000000002
then that's why it's so brief because

2780.069 --> 2787.96
it's just dissipated by the just when

2785.019 --> 2792.1299999999997
they equally create the placenta - but

2787.96 --> 2796.0190000000002
then it's absorb matter electricity yeah

2792.13 --> 2798.46
it is absorbed by the polar opposite

2796.019 --> 2802.8999999999996
tension and neutralized

2798.46 --> 2804.759
but it is basically like sound a thing

2802.9 --> 2806.859
that travels through the medium and

2804.759 --> 2811.809
without the medium it would not be there

2806.859 --> 2815.0789999999997
just like sound yeah but that's that is

2811.809 --> 2818.8590000000004
a real interesting thing that's very

2815.079 --> 2822.819
similar like it wouldn't exist without a

2818.859 --> 2825.13
medium yeah I don't think there is a

2822.819 --> 2827.2
place where there is no medium I think

2825.13 --> 2830.4990000000003
when we pull a vacuum in a vacuum

2827.2 --> 2833.6499999999996
chamber even if it's 10 to the minus 17

2830.499 --> 2837.0989999999997
Torre's presumed in space I think is too

2833.65 --> 2841.71
crowded with medium in there but maybe

2837.099 --> 2843.869
maybe but still I

2841.71 --> 2847.17
yeah I know what you mean it's like

2843.869 --> 2849.6600000000003
technically impossible but still yeah

2847.17 --> 2852.599
electricity could probably be made

2849.66 --> 2855.8999999999996
impossible to connect with in a vacuum

2852.599 --> 2858.4500000000003
as could sound be very easily be

2855.9 --> 2861.54
impossible to be transferred in a vacuum

2858.45 --> 2864.4199999999996
but light is very easy to transfer

2861.54 --> 2867.92
through a vacuum and that's just a given

2864.42 --> 2870.27
can definitely without any problems be

2867.92 --> 2873.15
visible through a vacuum and that just

2870.27 --> 2878.069
makes it so different from the other two

2873.15 --> 2880.26
effects well that's that means that we

2878.069 --> 2884.099
need to understand what's inside the

2880.26 --> 2887.2200000000003
vacuum chamber when we pull vacuum so my

2884.099 --> 2890.059
guess is that it's purely hydrogen so it

2887.22 --> 2893.5789999999997
can transfer a light but there is no

2890.059 --> 2897.42
static electricity hydrogen or no

2893.579 --> 2899.819
neutrons that's why it cannot transfer

2897.42 --> 2903.66
sound okay so you're claiming there's

2899.819 --> 2907.02
nonreactive hydrogen where there's where

2903.66 --> 2910.1299999999997
we presume to be a vacuum yeah that is

2907.02 --> 2913.079
very weird where would it be coming from

2910.13 --> 2915.359
well does it leach out of regular matter

2913.079 --> 2918.9300000000003
where it should be compressed you know

2915.359 --> 2920.4
in a precious I think it's just it's

2918.93 --> 2925.0789999999997
it's there all the time but it

2920.4 --> 2928.44
drastically can change size so I think

2925.079 --> 2931.65
it's it's still when you get like all

2928.44 --> 2933.809
the let's say impurities out of the

2931.65 --> 2937.38
vacuum chamber that they're in a gaseous

2933.809 --> 2942.329
state they're easier to get out because

2937.38 --> 2945.69
they have more neutral for more static

2942.329 --> 2948.21
electricity static charge inside and so

2945.69 --> 2951.299
they'll they'll be easily drawn out but

2948.21 --> 2953.359
then hydrogen doesn't have that so it's

2951.299 --> 2956.52
very hard to actually mechanically

2953.359 --> 2959.4
try to pull it out it's mechanically

2956.52 --> 2962.7599999999998
elusive you mean yeah yeah so I know

2959.4 --> 2964.53
that in a chamber pretty much almost

2962.76 --> 2968.0400000000004
everything will be able to be pulled out

2964.53 --> 2970.2900000000004
but they can't get a grasp on the

2968.04 --> 2973.44
hydrogen so it keeps slipping away back

2970.29 --> 2975.21
in basically that's it yeah yeah really

2973.44 --> 2977.76
but how do they

2975.21 --> 2979.579
are they then able to catch hydrogen in

2977.76 --> 2982.4700000000003
the first place because they are able to

2979.579 --> 2984.21
isolate it put it in tanks even in up to

2982.47 --> 2987.1189999999997
until a liquid form so why would they be

2984.21 --> 2988.44
and completely incapable to get it out

2987.119 --> 2991.619
of a vacuum chamber

2988.44 --> 2993.69
well I yeah I thought about the same

2991.619 --> 2997.79
thing but think about it when you

2993.69 --> 3001.7000000000003
actually pull a vacuum on a chamber

2997.79 --> 3003.77
you cannot squeeze anything out of it

3001.7 --> 3005.39
more than that so if you're left with

3003.77 --> 3008.03
only hydrogen then you have to shrink

3005.39 --> 3009.68
the chamber so you pressurize it again

3008.03 --> 3010.73
and then squeeze it out but it will be a

3009.68 --> 3014.66
very small amount

3010.73 --> 3017.839
all right so hydrogen can be dealt with

3014.66 --> 3020.0
under high pressure but not under the

3017.839 --> 3021.859
super low pressure that is that it it

3020.0 --> 3024.68
becomes untenable under super low

3021.859 --> 3028.2799999999997
pressure elusive but under high pressure

3024.68 --> 3030.41
you can kind of handle it yeah that's a

3028.28 --> 3034.76
pretty complicated process when they

3030.41 --> 3038.99
produce hydrogen I was working the other

3034.76 --> 3040.099
day the thing is that it's not that

3038.99 --> 3046.7299999999996
complicated

3040.099 --> 3049.46
you just basic electrolyze yeah well the

3046.73 --> 3052.16
water you know no no I mean I mean like

3049.46 --> 3054.079
in this industrial quality hydrogen in

3052.16 --> 3055.7
Lansing yeah

3054.079 --> 3057.6800000000003
no but they they just have to have

3055.7 --> 3061.79
perfect pure water and then split it up

3057.68 --> 3063.98
and divide it yeah but don't forget that

3061.79 --> 3067.46
you cannot split your water because it

3063.98 --> 3070.13
doesn't conduct electricity no but pure

3067.46 --> 3072.71
with the salt and the salt will remain

3070.13 --> 3077.96
behind that's known doesn't it doesn't

3072.71 --> 3080.51
evaporate well that's why I wanna I want

3077.96 --> 3084.04
for people to go and check out what we

3080.51 --> 3089.75
can fit they're doing now now no band

3084.04 --> 3091.7599999999998
yeah I know but I know what they deal

3089.75 --> 3094.91
with the presuming about water it's

3091.76 --> 3097.13
crazy but I know salt stays behind I've

3094.91 --> 3100.97
even done I've done that kind of thing

3097.13 --> 3104.2400000000002
myself and like weighted weight the

3100.97 --> 3106.609
actual and so yeah the thing that I'd

3104.24 --> 3107.6699999999996
used to dissolve it with staying behind

3106.609 --> 3111.21
and it's

3107.67 --> 3114.1800000000003
exactly what I put in there so I think

3111.21 --> 3117.839
it's absolutely in the salt stays behind

3114.18 --> 3120.0
when you do that because they were doing

3117.839 --> 3123.23
a test and it seems like in time the

3120.0 --> 3128.16
electricity electrolysis slows down and

3123.23 --> 3130.38
like the so is dissipated so and I might

3128.16 --> 3132.02
find that what we've been taught about

3130.38 --> 3134.46
chemistry it's true

3132.02 --> 3138.53
really I know but it makes sense that it

3134.46 --> 3142.799
would slow down there is an ideal

3138.53 --> 3145.38
conductivity balance between the salts

3142.799 --> 3147.54
also dissolved in water and if enough

3145.38 --> 3152.339
water dissolves and not the salt then

3147.54 --> 3154.38
eventually that ideal point will be it

3152.339 --> 3157.71
will go further away from that and then

3154.38 --> 3159.4500000000003
slow down that the process that's

3157.71 --> 3163.41
logical it's only logical that it

3159.45 --> 3165.8999999999996
happens yet the ideal state for the

3163.41 --> 3168.72
chemical reaction or conductivity or

3165.9 --> 3170.52
whatever is happening then it has a

3168.72 --> 3172.2
special balance as soon as it is veyts

3170.52 --> 3179.79
then the process slows down that's

3172.2 --> 3183.45
normal in chemistry oh I've been taught

3179.79 --> 3185.849
the same things but as I've seen they're

3183.45 --> 3188.46
doing stuff it doesn't seem that what

3185.849 --> 3190.8900000000003
we've been taught it's actually true cuz

3188.46 --> 3194.16
they've done like more than probably 30

3190.89 --> 3196.5299999999997
hours of experimentation and I've never

3194.16 --> 3199.0789999999997
seen anybody on YouTube doing that

3196.53 --> 3202.2000000000003
amount of experimentation or testing

3199.079 --> 3206.369
stuff okay is the effort that they went

3202.2 --> 3208.049
through is tremendous really well you

3206.369 --> 3209.73
gotta point me out at something that's

3208.049 --> 3211.89
actually interesting because I've seen

3209.73 --> 3216.39
stuff that they did was just terrible

3211.89 --> 3219.54
and that for me flag them immediately as

3216.39 --> 3221.4
totally unreliable because yeah soon as

3219.54 --> 3225.54
you start to go a certain directions it

3221.4 --> 3227.46
just becomes crazy and I don't know it

3225.54 --> 3230.099
may be they did do some good work if you

3227.46 --> 3236.369
can link me up with that then I'll watch

3230.099 --> 3239.04
that at least but in the beginning I had

3236.369 --> 3241.5
the same thoughts it seemed kind of very

3239.04 --> 3245.82
odd the things that their works

3241.5 --> 3249.3
learning and doing and at a certain

3245.82 --> 3251.81
point when I started seeing what their

3249.3 --> 3255.69
mindset is they're actually pretty

3251.81 --> 3258.69
pretty deep into the crux of it all so

3255.69 --> 3264.93
it's really really interesting much

3258.69 --> 3265.92
their opinion on dynein theory yeah they

3264.93 --> 3269.43
think it's [ __ ]

3265.92 --> 3272.94
Oh whether flatter or Thursday they are

3269.43 --> 3276.45
they they are force okay I didn't even

3272.94 --> 3278.82
know that mmm didn't really care too

3276.45 --> 3283.83
much but okay sure

3278.82 --> 3288.26
they have induced reductivism there okay

3283.83 --> 3292.41
when they they covered quite a lot of

3288.26 --> 3294.44
yeah chemistry because I was having

3292.41 --> 3297.87
issues with stuff being explained by

3294.44 --> 3301.9500000000003
people from that branch of science you

3297.87 --> 3303.69
know I was looking for stuff to find out

3301.95 --> 3307.5
if I need anybody is doing anything

3303.69 --> 3312.21
different because just stuff didn't add

3307.5 --> 3314.61
up and you can see that they're pretty

3312.21 --> 3317.58
not knowledgeable about what they're

3314.61 --> 3322.32
doing I know that atom from iron ground

3317.58 --> 3325.0499999999997
won't agree but still there is stuff

3322.32 --> 3328.3500000000004
that they do that you cannot deny that

3325.05 --> 3333.42
they they've managed to to see how it

3328.35 --> 3335.7
all works okay oh hey we'll see that

3333.42 --> 3337.62
when we get there so if you can present

3335.7 --> 3340.3199999999997
me something that you're convinced that

3337.62 --> 3342.72
I will change my entire attitude then

3340.32 --> 3349.79
yeah I'm curious I highly doubt it

3342.72 --> 3354.12
though yeah but I watched like probably

3349.79 --> 3358.92
35 to 40 hours of their last year into

3354.12 --> 3361.4
three months of videos so I have a

3358.92 --> 3367.7400000000002
pretty good understanding of what their

3361.4 --> 3370.08
general understanding chemistry's so

3367.74 --> 3372.7799999999997
I'll point you to the good stuff that

3370.08 --> 3378.14
they've done and back to the hydrogen

3372.78 --> 3380.82
in the vacuum I think that actually the

3378.14 --> 3385.41
majority of the that is that they made

3380.82 --> 3389.61
we had is based on hypotheses that were

3385.41 --> 3393.6
presented by them this it's really

3389.61 --> 3395.52
helped a lot to try and think in a

3393.6 --> 3396.15
different way because in the periodic

3395.52 --> 3400.17
table

3396.15 --> 3405.63
we were told that atoms in combinations

3400.17 --> 3408.3
with one another change size so you know

3405.63 --> 3412.5
that there is no no that's not true they

3408.3 --> 3415.3500000000004
don't they like the masses are pretty

3412.5 --> 3417.42
much they stay consistent but the size

3415.35 --> 3419.5499999999997
there's weird things with the sizes all

3417.42 --> 3421.53
the time in chemical reactions even with

3419.55 --> 3425.82
water just freezing water is weird

3421.53 --> 3429.0600000000004
enough by itself so yes so we know stuff

3425.82 --> 3430.92
change sites like what I learned is that

3429.06 --> 3434.79
basically the chemical reaction

3430.92 --> 3437.25
rearranges its structure and it it's

3434.79 --> 3439.14
like presumed to be like a crystal in

3437.25 --> 3441.15
there and then when the structure

3439.14 --> 3443.75
rearranges suddenly the spacing

3441.15 --> 3448.02
rearranges and that is how it is all

3443.75 --> 3451.11
then changed in volume basically per

3448.02 --> 3455.79
quantity that's how I learned it in

3451.11 --> 3462.86
chemistry yeah she changes the molecular

3455.79 --> 3462.86
grid let's say the infrastructure yeah

3463.31 --> 3471.27
so it's really different so it's it's

3468.24 --> 3474.06
really interesting and well I've what

3471.27 --> 3478.02
I've taught about testing is as well as

3474.06 --> 3481.59
getting a that's why I told to plant in

3478.02 --> 3484.59
his well I'm trying to get a small

3481.59 --> 3487.53
electric generator and I will put it in

3484.59 --> 3489.51
the vacuum shape chamber and run it in a

3487.53 --> 3492.84
vacuum and high pressure

3489.51 --> 3497.76
so I'll start from vacuum and then

3492.84 --> 3499.92
running it and seeing as I go to normal

3497.76 --> 3503.3700000000003
atmospheric pressure and then above that

3499.92 --> 3505.87
how it will change it or will change the

3503.37 --> 3511.39
production of the electricity the

3505.87 --> 3514.15
hmm good yeah that's nice it's like you

3511.39 --> 3516.19
can test anything under different

3514.15 --> 3518.52
pressure conditions and it'll you

3516.19 --> 3522.16
fascinating results because pressure

3518.52 --> 3523.03
that matters so much for how things work

3522.16 --> 3527.7999999999997
it's crazy

3523.03 --> 3533.2000000000003
I think pressure is the thing that makes

3527.8 --> 3536.23
everything works to be honest I well not

3533.2 --> 3539.3199999999997
necessarily but it may be because of the

3536.23 --> 3541.09
difference effects of all the that

3539.32 --> 3544.59
pressure has on all the elements that

3541.09 --> 3548.11
debt may be like a part of the original

3544.59 --> 3552.4300000000003
blueprint that spawned the complexities

3548.11 --> 3554.6200000000003
of the design of life yeah but yeah the

3552.43 --> 3557.95
different results from all the pressures

3554.62 --> 3561.69
and hey like a basic life is basically a

3557.95 --> 3563.95
pressure system that's how it arrives

3561.69 --> 3566.38
you have a difference in pressures

3563.95 --> 3568.99
that's how life starts to manifest the

3566.38 --> 3573.51
cell is a difference in pressure you

3568.99 --> 3577.54
know basic sense like like in the in the

3573.51 --> 3580.2400000000002
splitting of the of the female sorry the

3577.54 --> 3583.3
female of the embryo when you you get

3580.24 --> 3586.87
the sperm inside the egg then it splits

3583.3 --> 3589.0
into two so they become smaller but then

3586.87 --> 3590.77
they become four you know and smaller

3589.0 --> 3595.06
and that increases the pressure inside

3590.77 --> 3597.1
the cell so more pressure right more

3595.06 --> 3599.79
right there's probably a lot of

3597.1 --> 3602.62
intricate pressure triggered effects

3599.79 --> 3605.14
yeah that are just naturally

3602.62 --> 3608.98
systematically built-in they're like a

3605.14 --> 3612.8199999999997
natural part of the structure of it it's

3608.98 --> 3615.67
fully automated probably so just

3612.82 --> 3619.21
pressure makes things diffracting become

3615.67 --> 3626.41
smaller and maker it makes them more

3619.21 --> 3630.52
complicated yeah it's fascinating it is

3626.41 --> 3633.73
so see how I steam you need a because I

3630.52 --> 3638.05
had one set up ready now for a vacuum

3633.73 --> 3638.789
chamber but I scrapped it because there

3638.05 --> 3641.9990000000003
was too much

3638.789 --> 3645.3190000000004
would and I think that will leech me

3641.999 --> 3651.1789999999996
some moist air when I pull vacuum so I'm

3645.319 --> 3655.669
hoping now to fully metal vacuum chamber

3651.179 --> 3661.069
with plexiglass or see-through PVC

3655.669 --> 3664.469
panels so I won't have any contaminants

3661.069 --> 3668.969
and that that will take some some more

3664.469 --> 3673.9790000000003
time and some more expenses right yeah I

3668.969 --> 3678.109
start working out all i-5 checked the

3673.979 --> 3682.9489999999996
prices I'm going to order a specific

3678.109 --> 3686.16
square frames because it will be one

3682.949 --> 3692.009
meter and 20 centimeters long and it

3686.16 --> 3696.8999999999996
will be around 30 wide and 30 high so it

3692.009 --> 3699.66
will be pretty big and we need to

3696.9 --> 3704.759
withstand pressure and vacuum as well so

3699.66 --> 3709.6189999999997
it will be double-sided reinforced so I

3704.759 --> 3711.719
can plate it and deflate it as well Wow

3709.619 --> 3713.279
yeah you got to show that as soon as you

3711.719 --> 3721.289
got it finished that's gonna be

3713.279 --> 3723.659
impressive will be a parallel not a

3721.289 --> 3730.65
parallel but a box I don't know how to

3723.659 --> 3733.009
say that term in English so translate to

3730.65 --> 3733.009
Google

3733.79 --> 3738.769
[Music]

3744.869 --> 3751.589
yeah translated literally so it doesn't

3748.469 --> 3754.049
matter what literally how is what well

3751.589 --> 3756.089
just letter by letter it gave me the

3754.049 --> 3759.15
same thing in Latin as they wrote it

3756.089 --> 3764.18
down in hook so so there's no English

3759.15 --> 3769.65
word for it yeah so even get it square I

3764.18 --> 3772.529
don't know what's that it's rare take a

3769.65 --> 3775.969
square and I just stretch it to one side

3772.529 --> 3775.969
and that's the shape of the container

3777.469 --> 3788.219
okay right so I would like to

3781.049 --> 3793.829
rectangular looping Flat Earth yeah but

3788.219 --> 3798.989
it has height but so does well the model

3793.829 --> 3802.65
that I'm presuming it's basically like a

3798.989 --> 3805.71
giant aquarium but it's looping instead

3802.65 --> 3809.7000000000003
of having glass walls yeah yeah and

3805.71 --> 3812.099
maybe there's a top with all stars and

3809.7 --> 3818.089
there should be some guy in the top

3812.099 --> 3818.089
there it has to be right something there

3818.509 --> 3825.2690000000002
otherwise the vacuoles Brenda wins first

3822.329 --> 3828.21
team all right well it kind of depends

3825.269 --> 3829.979
on the nature of the realm conditions

3828.21 --> 3832.829
itself because if there are looping

3829.979 --> 3836.249
factors then I've also conceptualized

3832.829 --> 3839.4300000000003
simply in the realm of where physical

3836.249 --> 3842.339
matter can exist just stops so there

3839.43 --> 3844.5589999999997
would be like a border and simply

3842.339 --> 3847.619
nothing can go beyond that border

3844.559 --> 3854.369
whether it be gas pressure or anything

3847.619 --> 3856.319
physical it would just deflect it yeah

3854.369 --> 3862.4990000000003
that could be up there as well at some

3856.319 --> 3864.45
point as Natan says only god knows what

3862.499 --> 3869.839
it's up there may be one they won't know

3864.45 --> 3873.12
but right thank you pretty difficult

3869.839 --> 3876.13
maybe they know already

3873.12 --> 3878.74
well maybe they have some preliminary

3876.13 --> 3880.57
data maybe they did tests they just

3878.74 --> 3884.3799999999997
don't know what to make of it that's

3880.57 --> 3887.98
what I think probably they did bump into

3884.38 --> 3892.0
something but it didn't like splat like

3887.98 --> 3896.5
into a window maybe it bounced off and

3892.0 --> 3900.16
that gives some feel for me too indeed

3896.5 --> 3903.01
like a just a barrier a bubble of real

3900.16 --> 3905.5299999999997
physical reality out of which outside of

3903.01 --> 3908.38
which things simply cannot move cannot

3905.53 --> 3911.02
exist beyond and anything they'll go in

3908.38 --> 3913.81
their mates like a trampoline may

3911.02 --> 3917.08
stretch a bit and then just be deflected

3913.81 --> 3918.94
back like the realm itself may even to

3917.08 --> 3923.59
some limit be able to stretch and be

3918.94 --> 3925.2400000000002
flexible like a bubble but the bubble

3923.59 --> 3928.17
can never be pierced it will always be

3925.24 --> 3933.22
reverted back to the original state

3928.17 --> 3936.13
that's yeah that's one idea I had we

3933.22 --> 3939.79
very weird like you go in there in a

3936.13 --> 3945.06
rocket and you really go for go and it's

3939.79 --> 3948.7
like oh you don't literally get lot like

3945.06 --> 3951.43
catapulted down well it's like the goal

3948.7 --> 3958.0299999999997
the footage of the go-fast rocket it's

3951.43 --> 3959.8599999999997
very awkward yes so it stops it didn't

3958.03 --> 3963.76
get crushed or something and had pretty

3959.86 --> 3968.79
pretty incredible speed if it's a solid

3963.76 --> 3974.34
it'll crush it if it's something else

3968.79 --> 3977.77
you have to slow it down gently so it

3974.34 --> 3982.78
doesn't crush it or like elastic catch

3977.77 --> 3986.5
it like an air cushion or elastic right

3982.78 --> 3988.63
it's really really awkward I've watched

3986.5 --> 3992.47
it like a million times and it's every

3988.63 --> 3994.83
time it's it's totally awkward how it

3992.47 --> 3994.83
stops

3994.88 --> 4000.79
yeah to me it almost feels like what

3998.22 --> 4003.98
like it's some kind of trick

4000.79 --> 4009.02
yeah it's weird I don't know what to

4003.98 --> 4015.32
make of it or the footage will sped up

4009.02 --> 4017.57
and then slow down or I don't know it's

4015.32 --> 4020.3900000000003
your speculation well it is very

4017.57 --> 4022.01
confusing that all the way before that

4020.39 --> 4023.9
the whole thing is spinning at

4022.01 --> 4027.53
incredible speed that doesn't exactly

4023.9 --> 4034.67
help for orientating your nerves and

4027.53 --> 4037.9100000000003
everything yeah and you can see you

4034.67 --> 4049.31
actually Oh small the Sun in Dimona then

4037.91 --> 4051.3199999999997
after that yeah that was like hey vision

4049.31 --> 4053.75
I think I'm gonna round out the show the

4051.32 --> 4057.32
beta just started up you probably would

4053.75 --> 4061.73
take a look as well and I'd need a bit

4057.32 --> 4064.46
of a break as well yeah well but it was

4061.73 --> 4067.28
a fantastic talk I hope to have you back

4064.46 --> 4069.349
here this is good stuff I let's also

4067.28 --> 4071.15
keep what when we start doing some

4069.349 --> 4073.94
experiments because I think people learn

4071.15 --> 4075.8
now are not really happy with our

4073.94 --> 4079.19
discussion because it's a bit all over

4075.8 --> 4081.92
the place I don't give a [ __ ] I want

4079.19 --> 4084.83
this this is I mean yeah I need this

4081.92 --> 4087.05
because you're we're talking about but

4084.83 --> 4091.64
then other people know maybe like these

4087.05 --> 4093.98
guys are just solved there this is just

4091.64 --> 4096.68
preliminary research and I want to reach

4093.98 --> 4098.839
far and I want to use the depth of your

4096.68 --> 4102.7390000000005
mind because you're much more able to

4098.839 --> 4104.9
grasp all of this and I got a need for

4102.739 --> 4107.989
ourselves we're just brainstorming the

4104.9 --> 4110.7789999999995
[ __ ] up of the war so yes it's it will

4107.989 --> 4112.7
be more when I write everything down

4110.779 --> 4115.4890000000005
with the hypothesis and stuff to be

4112.7 --> 4118.849999999999
reading it out so to make sense and it

4115.489 --> 4121.759
will be technically specific so exactly

4118.85 --> 4122.950000000001
alright we're just brainstorming that's

4121.759 --> 4127.46
it

4122.95 --> 4128.2699999999995
yeah so thanks thanks for having me

4127.46 --> 4130.67
Arwen

4128.27 --> 4133.85
sorry if I annoyed some of yours and

4130.67 --> 4136.93
they had don't mind them I got some

4133.85 --> 4141.110000000001
trolls on their time my feelings are not

4136.93 --> 4142.72
so I don't really care and I know I'll

4141.11 --> 4145.969999999999
see you around

4142.72 --> 4148.88
yep all right hey thanks for coming man

4145.97 --> 4152.030000000001
it's been a blast and yeah you know what

4148.88 --> 4156.14
they get very silly in chat sometimes so

4152.03 --> 4158.8099999999995
I wouldn't take it too serious now I

4156.14 --> 4161.84
think everybody was very much just

4158.81 --> 4163.85
probably just as captivated by all the

4161.84 --> 4166.78
subject with that we talked about as I

4163.85 --> 4171.200000000001
was I loved it and I hope to do it again

4166.78 --> 4173.179999999999
hopefully sooner than later so and

4171.2 --> 4175.28
that's of course good will continue of

4173.18 --> 4178.280000000001
course the conversations just over Skype

4175.28 --> 4181.42
because yeah this is just a daily thing

4178.28 --> 4184.13
now and then we're digging through it

4181.42 --> 4189.37
and I love it so thanks for being on my

4184.13 --> 4189.37
show and how could see you back soon yep

4195.25 --> 4204.44

chats paypal patreon and my GoFundMe and

4247.96 --> 4256.67
I will be back tomorrow with flat earth

4250.61 --> 4259.25
early bird numbered 254 hashtag meifa

4256.67 --> 4260.79
indeed i also gonna join the debates

4259.25 --> 4263.7
right after they

4260.79 --> 4265.29
I'll see if that gets as interesting as

4263.7 --> 4270.57
it did yesterday I thought yesterday was

4265.29 --> 4274.41
pretty good so until the next video keep

4270.57 --> 4276.98
it flat and don't forget to drink plenty

4274.41 --> 4307.0289999999995
