over there at the construction site are

101.049 --> 107.85000000000001

129.789 --> 138.45899999999997
of guys one guy decided to keep on going

131.86 --> 142.36
great the tile cutter so let's see you

138.459 --> 148.44
is in chat Julia Pavan was first and a

142.36 --> 152.86
young good servant iron mare iron iron

148.44 --> 155.379
it keeps slipping the Oh in just a

152.86 --> 159.28
little I can't help it it's tough to get

155.379 --> 164.14999999999998
rid of that huh George Sanford Marc

159.28 --> 167.269
colored over McCole dank

164.15 --> 175.12
I meant that you yeah right

167.269 --> 178.01
yeah good to see you all Oh Kobe yeah I

175.12 --> 180.37
have no idea who that guy was but the

178.01 --> 184.97
name vaguely sounds familiar

180.37 --> 187.42000000000002
football player some tragic crash yeah

184.97 --> 187.42
it sucks

188.41 --> 191.53
[Music]

192.25 --> 200.739
yeah a basketball right

202.33 --> 208.19000000000003
see just goes to show how little I know

205.4 --> 214.04000000000002
about sports especially the people in

208.19 --> 217.37
sports like I still somewhat like

214.04 --> 220.19
football but I don't even know the names

217.37 --> 221.959
of the players that are currently going

220.19 --> 226.849
around in football in the Netherlands

221.959 --> 229.519
and it's like what you don't know for a

226.849 --> 232.159
lot of people here but I still remember

229.519 --> 234.41
a couple of names from I guess from

232.159 --> 235.129
bigger guys from the 90s and everything

234.41 --> 238.79
and that's it

235.129 --> 241.129
I just don't keep track anymore sports

238.79 --> 243.37
and I don't watch TV anymore you know

241.129 --> 246.739
and that was kind of the only source for

243.37 --> 249.26
occasional sports you know it would be

246.739 --> 252.799
out there like Oh a game is at this time

249.26 --> 255.44
at this time this channel and I would

252.799 --> 256.82
have the option maybe some friend would

255.44 --> 258.799
be over and would be fun watching

256.82 --> 262.21999999999997
together but yeah that doesn't happen

258.799 --> 264.169
anymore because I don't have any TV and

262.22 --> 269.63000000000005
besides it's it's kind of tough to find

264.169 --> 272.389
life games it it's still there on the on

269.63 --> 273.68
the Netherlands channel that is also

272.389 --> 276.979
through the available through the

273.68 --> 279.229
internet but I saw it so rarely check

276.979 --> 283.21999999999997
that anymore because most programs there

279.229 --> 287.9
are just so incredibly politicized it's

283.22 --> 289.61
just unbearable for me so I just don't

287.9 --> 293.83
go there it's like going to a Waller

289.61 --> 293.83000000000004
Channel yeah

299.59 --> 302.28
all right

304.35 --> 312.90000000000003
man and yeah Alex Jones is just and my

309.51 --> 315.36
guidance they're all now just hyping

312.9 --> 319.14
this freakin coronavirus so badly I

315.36 --> 324.39
managed to watch some of it I was sorry

319.14 --> 326.76
that I did because it's not good to be

324.39 --> 331.97999999999996
exposed to that kind of fear porn even

326.76 --> 338.61
if you're kind of aware of it like so

331.98 --> 345.15000000000003
yeah but it is interesting like that

338.61 --> 347.55
there's somewhat of a what is it was

345.15 --> 351.17999999999995
information from China that it was kind

347.55 --> 353.25
of an accidental release of a bioweapon

351.18 --> 354.54
that dwara are at least that's what Alex

353.25 --> 356.4
Jones was saying I haven't actually

354.54 --> 364.02000000000004
double-check anything haven't searched

356.4 --> 367.2
out for it but yeah it was funny though

364.02 --> 369.35999999999996
that Alex yesterday also really

367.2 --> 372.06
emphasized about the poor regions how

369.36 --> 375.12
they would typically fall prey to this

372.06 --> 375.9
and in a way it reflected part of what I

375.12 --> 379.14
was saying

375.9 --> 383.09999999999997
except he would still of course go with

379.14 --> 386.64
the the infectious virus and all that

383.1 --> 392.67
and all the measures it is kind of weird

386.64 --> 396.15
how that all works you know there's a

392.67 --> 398.49
weird thing about well the assumption of

396.15 --> 401.21999999999997
bacteria and virus theory in the first

398.49 --> 404.61
place and well testing the spreading and

401.22 --> 408.15000000000003
all that because once it's kind of

404.61 --> 410.6
manifested it it is kind of what it is

408.15 --> 410.59999999999997
and

413.45 --> 425.21
I don't know exactly why yeah there is

421.19 --> 427.7
something about I don't know about

425.21 --> 431.23999999999995
physical interaction and material

427.7 --> 435.22999999999996
interaction even if the condition is

431.24 --> 439.04
mostly psychosomatically spawned which

435.23 --> 443.54
is what I believe really you know there

439.04 --> 446.6
there's more to it than just that but it

443.54 --> 448.61
has a big part in it it's like you could

446.6 --> 451.34000000000003
see it in in another fashion I guess

448.61 --> 455.06
it's tough you know I'm still working on

451.34 --> 457.98999999999995
trying to figure this out this is my own

455.06 --> 460.94
personal side medical project and it is

457.99 --> 463.46000000000004
originally I thought German new medicine

460.94 --> 465.46999999999997
was just massively conflicting with my

463.46 --> 469.15999999999997
own views on the whole thing it's just

465.47 --> 472.85
like what what is so different this just

469.16 --> 474.98
the can't can't figure this out so it

472.85 --> 479.3
took a long time before I even start to

474.98 --> 481.25
see how it function I've spent years now

479.3 --> 488.81
paying attention and listening to my dad

481.25 --> 492.23
about it and but what yeah practically

488.81 --> 495.29
what comes down to is that potentially

492.23 --> 498.55
any type of disease or yeah whatever

495.29 --> 500.96000000000004
they say about the Simpsons that is

498.55 --> 504.74
potentially secondary again because of

500.96 --> 508.21999999999997
the week's points in people's bodies you

504.74 --> 511.82
know that's just usually what it comes

508.22 --> 514.63
down to and if you're just very strong

511.82 --> 518.84
and all that then the risk of having

514.63 --> 522.5
massive disease symptoms and potential

518.84 --> 526.46
fatality of it is just much much much

522.5 --> 530.57
limit and that is Universal almost with

526.46 --> 533.1500000000001
every type of condition may be parasitic

530.57 --> 536.3900000000001
specific because parasites are indeed

533.15 --> 538.31
like multicellular organisms there are

536.39 --> 539.75
definitely things even according to

538.31 --> 543.5899999999999
German new medicine like they're

539.75 --> 544.04
parasites are real so things like what

543.59 --> 553.5500000000001
is it

544.04 --> 557.93
the malaria that is real that's a real

553.55 --> 559.88
parasite for example and well yeah

557.93 --> 562.899
there's still plenty of parasitical

559.88 --> 565.97
based diseases around and those are real

562.899 --> 568.069
and and they have a different type of

565.97 --> 570.759
effect as things that are more

568.069 --> 580.55
associated with bacteria and viruses

570.759 --> 582.319
because it's more like it's just a

580.55 --> 584.3599999999999
natural part of the body and it deals

582.319 --> 587.149
with that kind of thing constantly and

584.36 --> 592.37
it is really when the whole thing is

587.149 --> 593.769
kind of upset or basically taking things

592.37 --> 596.9590000000001
out of context

593.769 --> 601.04
energy-wise because of the conscious

596.959 --> 605.4699999999999
ideas that the threat of something could

601.04 --> 609.8
be overemphasized potentially even

605.47 --> 612.7090000000001
creating more vulnerability to well that

609.8 --> 615.29
kind of backlash to the full response

612.709 --> 618.0189999999999
it's like okay the body thinks because

615.29 --> 619.9699999999999
of the mind that is the threat is so

618.019 --> 622.37
severe because the simple the symptoms

619.97 --> 626.36
are taken literal so the body will then

622.37 --> 629.24
over respond basically or could could

626.36 --> 633.23
decide to go upon over response and and

629.24 --> 639.279
totally engage in one or more of these

633.23 --> 645.6800000000001
types of centers it's it's complex yeah

639.279 --> 647.449
you know even even medically like from a

645.68 --> 650.42
more scientific perspective it could

647.449 --> 654.67
take a long time to really broadly

650.42 --> 655.9
figure this out including with man-made

654.67 --> 658.68
yeah

655.9 --> 660.9599999999999
entities man-made viruses or bacteria

658.68 --> 663.7299999999999
supposedly and what that really does

660.96 --> 666.52
become yeah because the German new

663.73 --> 670.27
medicine research that well the the new

666.52 --> 672.61
current writings and knowledge how that

670.27 --> 675.88
works where that is based upon is really

672.61 --> 678.79
upon the works since Rudolf Steiner

675.88 --> 683.05
since the the 1940s

678.79 --> 686.4599999999999
so it's not really super fresh based

683.05 --> 688.9
information it is relatively old now but

686.46 --> 691.6600000000001
that doesn't mean it doesn't work it's

688.9 --> 695.77
just not there's more development since

691.66 --> 700.06
that it's complex because there was so

695.77 --> 704.05
much testing with this right that it is

700.06 --> 706.75
pretty reliable in basic situations but

704.05 --> 713.02
in complex situations yeah it's just not

706.75 --> 716.26
really tested on that yeah so this is

713.02 --> 719.56
this is like on the edge medical science

716.26 --> 722.52
that literally nobody knows about have

719.56 --> 725.6199999999999
you ever heard anybody out there ever

722.52 --> 727.209
besides me talking about German new

725.62 --> 730.6
medicine have you ever even heard the

727.209 --> 733.0
terminology ever no it's a real thing

730.6 --> 736.24
it's been out there forth for some time

733.0 --> 739.27
and it's fast and it has injuries German

736.24 --> 742.2090000000001
originally and they they had very

739.27 --> 744.1
high-end alternative seen medically

742.209 --> 746.4699999999999
medical wise and it was a part of it but

744.1 --> 749.5600000000001
still the lobby the medical lobby

746.47 --> 752.2
attacked the German new medicine users a

749.56 --> 755.64
lot just like most other altered like

752.2 --> 759.75
really alternative or anti allopathic

755.64 --> 759.75
medical systems

762.45 --> 768.5600000000001
but it's real

764.04 --> 774.75
so yeah it's mostly unknown in Germany

768.56 --> 782.6099999999999
also no yeah but you can look it up it's

774.75 --> 784.89
fascinating how it works and the thing

782.61 --> 788.6
is whatever you're gonna decide to do

784.89 --> 792.12
with it everything about it

788.6 --> 796.44
once you just have the writing it

792.12 --> 800.37
basically never tells you to get

796.44 --> 803.61
anything to take anything it is just an

800.37 --> 807.51
explanation basically of of the effects

803.61 --> 811.74
and the way it's fascinating it's it's

807.51 --> 813.39
aromatic you can see it you can see when

811.74 --> 820.98
you read it it's herb it's based on

813.39 --> 822.96
hermetics it's fascinating right but it

820.98 --> 826.32
doesn't tell you yeah oh you have to get

822.96 --> 828.6600000000001
this type of plant or even or this type

826.32 --> 832.38
of food no it just tells you what it so

828.66 --> 835.68
it'll never cost you a cent it's the

832.38 --> 837.78
cheapest method ever it's just it one

835.68 --> 840.63
thing about it is it just tells you look

837.78 --> 842.4599999999999
there's going to be moments when you're

840.63 --> 845.37
going to be very troubled by certain

842.46 --> 848.73
symptoms and the whole issue is learn

845.37 --> 851.61
how to deal with it and trust what's

848.73 --> 854.58
going on don't be afraid of Cataclysm

851.61 --> 856.98
don't be afraid of escalation it is a

854.58 --> 861.71
basically a more disciplined way to

856.98 --> 864.24
approach the situation with the spirit

861.71 --> 868.37
cooperating with the knowledge of

864.24 --> 868.37
placebo and nocebo and all that

876.48 --> 881.19
so yeah any any level feedback would be

879.54 --> 883.4399999999999
good at this point I've never had any

881.19 --> 888.75
feedback it's like every time I talk

883.44 --> 892.32
about it it's just like but I think I

888.75 --> 894.65
shared websites but it because there are

892.32 --> 894.6500000000001
websites

904.89 --> 910.1999999999999
yeah

907.02 --> 914.01
also for those that are interested in

910.2 --> 916.5600000000001
things like was it feet reflux therapy

914.01 --> 922.25
and that kind of thing or even chakras

916.56 --> 926.459
or specific point relations of the body

922.25 --> 929.1
with other point that kind of thing when

926.459 --> 931.2299999999999
they look into German numerous and

929.1 --> 937.02
they'll find it very fascinating that it

931.23 --> 940.01
is like almost every location and type

937.02 --> 942.23
of tissue and everything is pretty much

940.01 --> 946.8
categorized it's almost like a giant

942.23 --> 948.99
astrological chart of the body as to the

946.8 --> 951.3299999999999
typical correlation like the spiritual

948.99 --> 954.27
correlations in a way that that's or the

951.33 --> 956.97
mental correlations like typical

954.27 --> 960.06
experience that associate with certain

956.97 --> 964.74
types of positions it's is fascinating

960.06 --> 967.5
and hey does that do dabble in Australia

964.74 --> 969.36
Australia do if they don't spiral out of

967.5 --> 972.329
control too much don't over generalize

969.36 --> 974.97
too much they do know that it is they're

972.329 --> 977.5999999999999
basically tapping into a weave beyond

974.97 --> 982.07
our understanding that does work out and

977.6 --> 982.07
so does German new medicine

987.33 --> 991.5500000000001
oh yeah are you guys talking about

996.33 --> 999.44
[Applause]

1001.79 --> 1007.23
[Music]

1004.95 --> 1010.37
yeah I heard about that and saw that

1007.23 --> 1010.37
clear it's it's weird

1020.01 --> 1028.54
yeah good servant if you're in yeah I

1025.26 --> 1031.35
could give you some links too but I'll

1028.54 --> 1031.35
give it over Skype

1042.41 --> 1045.529
[Music]

1053.72 --> 1060.159
right yeah anyway yeah that was about

1057.889 --> 1060.1589999999999
that

1065.49 --> 1069.549
[Music]

1071.8 --> 1078.6699999999998
why over Skype well because I don't have

1074.8 --> 1081.07
the links ready at hand like currently I

1078.67 --> 1083.41
only have like a link that is in a Dutch

1081.07 --> 1088.74
translation I think let me check let me

1083.41 --> 1095.28
double check that if I can even find it

1088.74 --> 1095.28
my bookmarks are a bit fast these days

1112.0 --> 1120.94
oh dear I was afraid of that

1116.71 --> 1123.28
yeah that's it's probably the link is

1120.94 --> 1128.13
still in Skype somewhere in the in the

1123.28 --> 1131.189
chat I have with my dad there anyway

1128.13 --> 1131.189
[Music]

1138.53 --> 1150.01
I could I don't know seeking truth I

1145.0 --> 1150.01
guess that could be true

1150.52 --> 1160.22
Reich hammer no no that's not well I

1154.72 --> 1164.059
don't know I don't know who the what is

1160.22 --> 1167.45
it the not the inventor but the one who

1164.059 --> 1170.08
is registered for the the works who that

1167.45 --> 1182.049
is or if it's like an organization I

1170.08 --> 1186.039
don't know dude okay oh okay

1182.049 --> 1186.039
sleeping warrior wants to come on

1187.53 --> 1192.51
okay why not I guess it's gonna be

1190.77 --> 1197.549
talking about flatter than the Black

1192.51 --> 1200.539
Swan and he originated German if we're

1197.549 --> 1201.809
talking about Saint okay okay

1200.539 --> 1205.2
interesting

1201.809 --> 1207.809
oh I didn't know that about him I don't

1205.2 --> 1214.289
really care because it's a bit rough

1207.809 --> 1216.84
right it's a bit elephant in the

1214.289 --> 1222.0
porcelain room through the window or

1216.84 --> 1225.84
whatever but yeah roughly that could be

1222.0 --> 1229.01
sort of established to be true it's kind

1225.84 --> 1229.01
of over generalised though

1234.82 --> 1240.3899999999999
you know it's

1237.51 --> 1244.679
but to really ascribe it these days to a

1240.39 --> 1248.1000000000001
specific group may be may be incorrect

1244.679 --> 1251.8200000000002
now like in the way you could consider

1248.1 --> 1253.83
that all people in those groups have

1251.82 --> 1256.77
designed it have originally

1253.83 --> 1261.12
conceptualized that kind of control

1256.77 --> 1265.91
system it doesn't mean that it's all

1261.12 --> 1268.7099999999998
them now no and you can typically tell

1265.91 --> 1270.9
who are like well you can say the

1268.71 --> 1274.669
travelers among doctors and that is

1270.9 --> 1278.19
those that advise certain types of

1274.669 --> 1282.39
medicine or whatever procedures but

1278.19 --> 1284.8200000000002
don't do it themselves especially when

1282.39 --> 1288.5700000000002
they lie about it get caught lying about

1284.82 --> 1291.3899999999999
not doing it like that they said they do

1288.57 --> 1294.36
it and then turn out they didn't that

1291.39 --> 1298.7700000000002
kind of thing that is very telling but

1294.36 --> 1301.9189999999999
not every doctor is aware and makes that

1298.77 --> 1304.32
choice there's doctors that become aware

1301.919 --> 1305.97
and that don't know what to do about it

1304.32 --> 1308.1
then they basically freeze up to get

1305.97 --> 1310.02
depressed or whatever and there's others

1308.1 --> 1314.1
that are like too rebellious and they

1310.02 --> 1318.33
say no way I'm I'm gonna try other ways

1314.1 --> 1320.8799999999999
and then eventually they get ostracized

1318.33 --> 1324.96
and they have to find some other way to

1320.88 --> 1327.2700000000002
get around now that happens a lot or

1324.96 --> 1329.1000000000001
that happened a lot of don't know how

1327.27 --> 1331.7
much it happens these days probably

1329.1 --> 1331.6999999999998
still

1348.06 --> 1350.54
what

1352.1 --> 1361.85
what kind of creepy remark is that

1356.169 --> 1364.029
Christian kawar what do you know about

1361.85 --> 1364.029
that

1426.12 --> 1429.8899999999999
I don't know where this is all going

1430.94 --> 1437.43
implant chips during Kela that can be

1433.53 --> 1438.84
activated by satellites a kilowatt well

1437.43 --> 1444.39
that sounds like a pretty crazy

1438.84 --> 1446.49
conspiracy theory to me but possible

1444.39 --> 1449.3700000000001
although the satellites have absolutely

1446.49 --> 1457.71
nothing to do with that it could be

1449.37 --> 1462.54
signal based to be fair it means

1457.71 --> 1466.26
anything I at some point thought that I

1462.54 --> 1469.92
was like implanted with one of those

1466.26 --> 1475.47
devices too but in retrospect I think

1469.92 --> 1480.5700000000002
that that didn't happen I can't exactly

1475.47 --> 1485.67
tie it into a physical situation but

1480.57 --> 1488.51
that terrified me for a long time it's

1485.67 --> 1491.6100000000001
one of the things that kept haunting me

1488.51 --> 1494.52
while it was still very unconscious of a

1491.61 --> 1498.4199999999998
lot got that idea that nightmare came

1494.52 --> 1501.51
popping back and it just would start to

1498.42 --> 1507.18
go spiraling paranoid out of control

1501.51 --> 1510.92
that I didn't yeah so I can't really say

1507.18 --> 1515.91
anything about that concept you know

1510.92 --> 1520.89
Psychopaths can invent all kinds kinds

1515.91 --> 1525.44
of very brutal creepy sneaky control

1520.89 --> 1527.91
mechanisms you know oh sorry yes

1525.44 --> 1534.0900000000001
sorry sleeping warrior I was kind of

1527.91 --> 1537.44
rounding up the subject hold on let me

1534.09 --> 1537.4399999999998
get things ready

1539.4 --> 1545.19
alright okay I'm gonna call you

1548.35 --> 1553.6299999999999
[Music]

1551.91 --> 1557.14
Hey

1553.63 --> 1561.429
hello Tony mornings little than a high

1557.14 --> 1566.5900000000001
five yeah sorry I was rounding up a

1561.429 --> 1571.0900000000001
certain subject rubbish this is yeah how

1566.59 --> 1574.99
are you doing good man good you yeah do

1571.09 --> 1579.22
okay bit tired was I'm okay

1574.99 --> 1581.02
I want I wanted to come on and he lost

1579.22 --> 1582.91
two runs here I know that you and Monty

1581.02 --> 1584.23
had a belief in the back in the in the

1582.91 --> 1586.929
past but I wanted to just sing his

1584.23 --> 1589.059
praises a little bit Myles falaya Davis

1586.929 --> 1591.67
is poor video are a few days or he's

1589.059 --> 1594.58
quite sure when but it was of turbines

1591.67 --> 1597.6100000000001
on the horizon and he he was asking the

1594.58 --> 1599.26
question what is the obstruction and

1597.61 --> 1601.3899999999999
runs he picked up on it and he said I

1599.26 --> 1604.03
know well you know our high off the

1601.39 --> 1605.7700000000002
ground way what we looking at all right

1604.03 --> 1607.36
I know the turbines but which turbines

1605.77 --> 1608.77
come on give us some basics and he

1607.36 --> 1610.99
wouldn't give them for whatever reason

1608.77 --> 1612.76
and I'd sister fancies it like he's

1610.99 --> 1614.53
playing funny book is this guy like just

1612.76 --> 1617.05
ignore him don't bother and ye don't

1614.53 --> 1618.22
even engage any way around he wants it

1617.05 --> 1619.6599999999999
to know cuz he wants to have a look at

1618.22 --> 1623.41
it you know he's genuinely interested

1619.66 --> 1624.97
now miles didn't give any info and he

1623.41 --> 1627.1000000000001
said he will be releasing more info over

1624.97 --> 1627.75
the next coming weeks and all days or

1627.1 --> 1630.9699999999998
whatever

1627.75 --> 1632.53
anyway runs he basically dropped it

1630.97 --> 1634.15
because without knowing where he is and

1632.53 --> 1635.62
what he's looking at how can you come to

1634.15 --> 1638.5590000000002
any logical conclusion of what he's

1635.62 --> 1640.4499999999998
looking at and anyway it turns out that

1638.559 --> 1641.83
it was was looking at some turbines that

1640.45 --> 1643.0900000000001
were on top of the hill that were

1641.83 --> 1645.3999999999999
obstructed by a hill in the middle

1643.09 --> 1646.6
ground or in the foreground and it just

1645.4 --> 1649.39
happened to have quite a flat looking

1646.6 --> 1651.76
top on it and when you realize that

1649.39 --> 1653.71
that's what it is and it's like miles

1651.76 --> 1655.87
what we trying to do we trying to set a

1653.71 --> 1658.0
trap and if you were trying to set a

1655.87 --> 1660.4289999999999
trap a what does that say about you but

1658.0 --> 1662.17
B you need to give credit for flattered

1660.429 --> 1663.49
for not jumping to conclusions because

1662.17 --> 1665.26
that's obviously the trap you were

1663.49 --> 1668.02
trying to set and as far as I can see

1665.26 --> 1669.61
nobody's fallen for it worse the credit

1668.02 --> 1671.2
for flat earth miles and he's not going

1669.61 --> 1673.4199999999998
to do easy but I just wanted to give

1671.2 --> 1675.25
runty a bit of kudos because Eve

1673.42 --> 1676.54
correctly called that he needed more

1675.25 --> 1678.46
information he didn't jump to

1676.54 --> 1680.17
conclusions and miles

1678.46 --> 1682.57
the lion Davis has tried to set a trap

1680.17 --> 1684.4
and failed so shout out to Miles for

1682.57 --> 1685.8999999999999
being the dishonest idiot he is

1684.4 --> 1687.76
yeah lots of ranty for doing the right

1685.9 --> 1689.65
thing proper homework and their

1687.76 --> 1695.85
shoutouts Flat Earth basically Trump

1689.65 --> 1699.0700000000002
into Global's again yep

1695.85 --> 1701.74
so I don't know what his intentions were

1699.07 --> 1703.24
I don't know what his intentions were

1701.74 --> 1704.83
but you obviously knew that these were

1703.24 --> 1707.56
obstructed by a hill in the foreground

1704.83 --> 1709.51
what and I know he's set a trap and it

1707.56 --> 1711.01
no one's bit so it's like mozzie you're

1709.51 --> 1711.94
gonna credit us or are you just gonna

1711.01 --> 1713.56
say mm-hmm

1711.94 --> 1715.69
I'm sure he's gonna put a ball a spin on

1713.56 --> 1717.19
it but the fact is he set it as a trap

1715.69 --> 1718.72
and it didn't it didn't it wasn't

1717.19 --> 1718.9
executed because nobody took him up on

1718.72 --> 1724.09
it

1718.9 --> 1727.24
hahahahaha yep yeah they they're getting

1724.09 --> 1728.79
all trap you know trying to make lay

1727.24 --> 1731.29
traps

1728.79 --> 1733.87
well that's cuz the count they can't

1731.29 --> 1735.78
engage us you know correct person to

1733.87 --> 1738.07
person so they're gonna set out traps

1735.78 --> 1740.1399999999999
they think they're they're hunting for a

1738.07 --> 1743.35
flat earthers like we're some kind of

1740.14 --> 1746.5600000000002
prey animals but yeah we're you know

1743.35 --> 1749.08
we're the hunters actually yeah and the

1746.56 --> 1751.24
reality is none of them like none of

1749.08 --> 1755.8
them like I'm like I'm getting a bit of

1751.24 --> 1761.59
feedback it might be me yeah you forgot

1755.8 --> 1768.33
running there might be that I think it's

1761.59 --> 1771.97
that now should be better I think

1768.33 --> 1773.83
yeah the reality is that I think he was

1771.97 --> 1776.8600000000001
using it as a distraction away from the

1773.83 --> 1778.54
the black the Black Swan arguments and

1776.86 --> 1780.1899999999998
they need to get away from that all cost

1778.54 --> 1781.93
they don't like it because they know

1780.19 --> 1785.05
when we know that they know that it's it

1781.93 --> 1786.4
causes in trouble so where they can't

1785.05 --> 1788.02
even be honest enough to address the

1786.4 --> 1789.97
blacks one argument properly oh yeah

1788.02 --> 1792.25
claiming randomly that some arbitrary

1789.97 --> 1793.81
point is the horizon it's not gonna do

1792.25 --> 1798.52
good it's not going far enough is it

1793.81 --> 1800.96
let's be honest shout out to all the

1798.52 --> 1805.8799999999999
ball as it can except the Black Swan

1800.96 --> 1808.31
shout out attractive yeah but yeah it's

1805.88 --> 1810.68
gonna be what it is for a while and

1808.31 --> 1812.72
there's probably gonna be more examples

1810.68 --> 1815.99
like this and yeah I already predicted

1812.72 --> 1818.81
it they're just not gonna address it you

1815.99 --> 1821.42
know they've become so trained in red

1818.81 --> 1825.83
herring and straw Manning and a constant

1821.42 --> 1830.3600000000001
basis even to some eloquent levels with

1825.83 --> 1833.48
some individuals that really are

1830.36 --> 1836.4199999999998
hardcore evidence even the Black Swan

1833.48 --> 1838.52
evidence does not hold the same level of

1836.42 --> 1841.8500000000001
weight to them because they're just used

1838.52 --> 1844.46
to going around everything anyway see to

1841.85 --> 1846.3799999999999
them it's all the same to them it's

1844.46 --> 1849.95
completely different their perspective

1846.38 --> 1853.5500000000002
on things as us we do no actually

1849.95 --> 1854.9
recognize the reality of things I know

1853.55 --> 1858.2
what there's no denying the reality of

1854.9 --> 1859.7
that picture that horizon is in a pretty

1858.2 --> 1861.1100000000001
in the position that the ball is just

1859.7 --> 1863.78
can't accept they're just denying it

1861.11 --> 1865.9699999999998
it's like oh you've got WOM pitch there

1863.78 --> 1869.68
the apparent horizon is not looming

1865.97 --> 1872.0
above the actual horizon as you possible

1869.68 --> 1873.3200000000002
yeah they don't like it me you just

1872.0 --> 1876.26
don't like it and I just think it's

1873.32 --> 1878.09
great the funny that's technically the

1876.26 --> 1881.24
other way around could be possible you

1878.09 --> 1883.1
know like like if you're close enough to

1881.24 --> 1886.3700000000001
the ground if there's gonna be any kind

1883.1 --> 1888.9199999999998
of hill or whatever yeah you could still

1886.37 --> 1890.9599999999998
be too close to the ground to see that

1888.92 --> 1893.72
far and you will see the actual horizon

1890.96 --> 1895.3600000000001
because of the observer heights but the

1893.72 --> 1899.24
other way around is never you can never

1895.36 --> 1905.3
see an optical horizon behind the actual

1899.24 --> 1906.71
curve yep that's yeah I agree and they

1905.3 --> 1907.97
don't like it and they're just ignoring

1906.71 --> 1909.83
it but putting the fingers in the reason

1907.97 --> 1912.23
going la la la la and we're just going

1909.83 --> 1913.6999999999998
yeah guys this is gonna stay around for

1912.23 --> 1916.04
a while you're gonna have to address it

1913.7 --> 1918.38
come on why is your horizon behind it

1916.04 --> 1919.9099999999999
and miles the barber thoroughly picks

1918.38 --> 1921.8000000000002
some random point and says that's the

1919.91 --> 1923.3600000000001
horizon it's like no it's not idiot it's

1921.8 --> 1924.8
defined it's the point where the sky

1923.36 --> 1927.29
appears to meet the correct to see oh

1924.8 --> 1929.1499999999999
but there's a refraction yeah all we see

1927.29 --> 1931.1
is like bendy from deviations from

1929.15 --> 1933.41
straight that's consistent with Fermat's

1931.1 --> 1934.279
principle and it's negligible it's no

1933.41 --> 1937.6390000000001
evidence of anything

1934.279 --> 1939.739
else enough refraction actual refraction

1937.639 --> 1942.4089999999999
causes basic Distortion

1939.739 --> 1946.039
it now says the blur over distance the

1942.409 --> 1948.769
more refraction there is the closer by

1946.039 --> 1952.669
the eventual not the horizon but the

1948.769 --> 1955.309
eventual backdrop zone will be in the

1952.669 --> 1956.8690000000001
back because when it becomes too blurred

1955.309 --> 1960.049
up that's when you no longer see

1956.869 --> 1962.749
anything else but the sky that is caused

1960.049 --> 1964.94
by the refraction blurring and the more

1962.749 --> 1967.58
refraction is the closer by that becomes

1964.94 --> 1970.219
so in very moist days yeah that is very

1967.58 --> 1973.129
close and of course it can also be

1970.219 --> 1975.8890000000001
physically obstructed by mist but it

1973.129 --> 1978.7289999999998
doesn't always have to be that can

1975.889 --> 1981.7099999999998
literally be refraction from thick air

1978.729 --> 1983.96
but that's not doesn't cause the horizon

1981.71 --> 1987.409
though the horizon is specifically not

1983.96 --> 1990.019
by car caused by that has no relations

1987.409 --> 1992.0590000000002
that's their fraction that's a local

1990.019 --> 1994.279
effect of the interaction with the

1992.059 --> 1997.07
matter it causes it to dip down and then

1994.279 --> 1999.619
reflect off and it's very specifically

1997.07 --> 2001.869
correlated to the angle the critical

1999.619 --> 2004.149
angle that causes it to suddenly dip

2001.869 --> 2006.4289999999999
down that's that fraction just like with

2004.149 --> 2009.9089999999999
the double slit because it comes close

2006.429 --> 2013.69
enough suddenly it it changes direction

2009.909 --> 2017.8590000000002
and most of it is it's gonna go to the

2013.69 --> 2020.799
side so whatever it's gonna then do it's

2017.859 --> 2023.109
either gonna bounce down and reflect

2020.799 --> 2024.639
that cup or it's gonna bounce up so it's

2023.109 --> 2027.639
going to always be up and that's why you

2024.639 --> 2030.7289999999998
see a mirror point beyond the horizon do

2027.639 --> 2032.9789999999998
you see yeah but do you get it now it

2030.729 --> 2036.789
took me a long time like two years to

2032.979 --> 2039.219
really figure it out I got like puzzle

2036.789 --> 2041.229
pieces you know back then diffraction

2039.219 --> 2044.589
refraction limited viewing angle

2041.229 --> 2047.529
resolution all of these things but I was

2044.589 --> 2051.46
never really able to fit the pieces

2047.529 --> 2053.589
together properly now suddenly I can put

2051.46 --> 2055.75
them together I can really see what is

2053.589 --> 2058.419
what and not be mistaken about it anyway

2055.75 --> 2061.61
I like it so it's there's gonna be more

2058.419 --> 2066.92
progress from the optical slant

2061.61 --> 2069.17
and every year I think that I think

2066.92 --> 2071.15
there are so ma most of the ballers must

2069.17 --> 2072.62
be controlled because there's no way

2071.15 --> 2074.63
that they can genuinely think that The

2072.62 --> 2076.5499999999997
Horizon is explained on their model it's

2074.63 --> 2078.59
like your model cannot do what it's

2076.55 --> 2080.8700000000003
showing there it does so how is this

2078.59 --> 2083.1200000000003
explained and then they explain it and I

2080.87 --> 2084.8599999999997
say yeah light doesn't follow a curve it

2083.12 --> 2086.66
deviates from straight that is what the

2084.86 --> 2088.88
science says your one when they say

2086.66 --> 2090.5299999999997
refraction they mean bet curving of

2088.88 --> 2092.15
light but what fraction is is not the

2090.53 --> 2093.4700000000003
curving of light curving of light

2092.15 --> 2095.69
doesn't appear in the definition for

2093.47 --> 2096.9199999999996
refraction but they think it does so we

2095.69 --> 2099.14
need to keep pointing out that seven

2096.92 --> 2101.2400000000002
over six are is not refraction it's just

2099.14 --> 2102.68
a made-up term that that is there simply

2101.24 --> 2105.49
for their model but doesn't exist real

2102.68 --> 2105.49
world or in science

2106.21 --> 2113.3
somebody Chad is saying that the double

2110.24 --> 2115.91
slit is [ __ ] like if they say that

2113.3 --> 2117.9500000000003
quantum delay or you know the the which

2115.91 --> 2119.96
path knowing which paths if they

2117.95 --> 2121.85
disbelieve that I'd go yeah you know I

2119.96 --> 2125.33
have my doubts about it still I get the

2121.85 --> 2126.86
concept but to say that diffraction

2125.33 --> 2129.3199999999997
because a double slit doesn't happen

2126.86 --> 2131.44
that is ridiculous anyone can literally

2129.32 --> 2140.48
do that with anything any type of light

2131.44 --> 2143.78
so that's some people in here know but a

2140.48 --> 2145.64
single photon is not relevant see that

2143.78 --> 2149.5400000000004
the sledgehammer the single photon

2145.64 --> 2153.74
concept is specifically related to the

2149.54 --> 2158.0299999999997
knowing which path experiment that's not

2153.74 --> 2160.43
double slit double slit is literally two

2158.03 --> 2163.9100000000003
slits you hit it with light it doesn't

2160.43 --> 2166.6099999999997
have to be a minimum you can just sign

2163.91 --> 2170.8399999999997
the light on it you see the diffraction

2166.61 --> 2173.8700000000003
pattern that's anyone can do that

2170.84 --> 2176.63
this is even a non demonstrated that and

2173.87 --> 2179.5699999999997
then he fantasizes about it being a wave

2176.63 --> 2184.69
it's not but it does diffract it does

2179.57 --> 2186.28
deviate okay the sledgehammer

2184.69 --> 2188.559
the problem with the NHANES he

2186.28 --> 2191.079
continuously over talks people so but by

2188.559 --> 2192.6400000000003
doing that you don't get heard and if

2191.079 --> 2195.0
you're not being heard you just talking

2192.64 --> 2200.02
no one's listening but he was listening

2195.0 --> 2202.75
yeah he's he's being a dick about it

2200.02 --> 2205.66
yeah like he hasn't figured out how to

2202.75 --> 2207.64
proceed so he's just falling back on

2205.66 --> 2209.5299999999997
repeating the same [ __ ] over and over

2207.64 --> 2212.799
again like trusting that it'll be right

2209.53 --> 2215.079
but that's very foolish because he's

2212.799 --> 2217.299
literally ignoring all the counter

2215.079 --> 2221.92
arguments that I've been giving him you

2217.299 --> 2224.619
know I am absolutely 100 point Oh a

2221.92 --> 2226.69
percent sure that light is not a wave

2224.619 --> 2230.049
and it can explain in detail why now

2226.69 --> 2232.69
like what is fast detail my optics

2230.049 --> 2234.97
knowledge is expanded greatly in the

2232.69 --> 2237.16
last year lights no lights not a wave

2234.97 --> 2239.109
because a wave is a function it's a it's

2237.16 --> 2242.74
a behavior it's an action it's not

2239.109 --> 2244.8089999999997
actually an app it's it it's like it's a

2242.74 --> 2246.549
crowd you can behave badly and if

2244.809 --> 2249.369
they're behaving badly is the is the

2246.549 --> 2251.71
wave behavior it's not you can't have a

2249.369 --> 2252.94
wave you need matter to have wave doing

2251.71 --> 2255.029
some but it's matter doing something

2252.94 --> 2258.279
that creates the wave like like water

2255.029 --> 2259.809
water isn't a way it can be a wave but

2258.279 --> 2263.95
it can also be flat but it's to do with

2259.809 --> 2266.71
our it behaves sound and yeah yeah

2263.95 --> 2269.529
indeed yeah Leidy is not a wave and that

2266.71 --> 2271.299
mistake that missed my assumption is

2269.529 --> 2273.88
bail yeah but did a lot of people do it

2271.299 --> 2275.23
it's because some and I'm gonna be very

2273.88 --> 2277.7200000000003
dickish about every time not gonna

2275.23 --> 2281.98
mention his name though but some dick

2277.72 --> 2285.64
like what is it 80 90 years ago decided

2281.98 --> 2289.15
to call that diffraction pattern a wave

2285.64 --> 2291.279
function because of that deck now every

2289.15 --> 2293.5
there's like huge amounts of people that

2291.279 --> 2295.45
even shortly after started to

2293.5 --> 2299.14
philosophize about lies being a wave

2295.45 --> 2301.049
it's all based on that stupid name it's

2299.14 --> 2305.89
not a wave it's just a pattern that

2301.049 --> 2308.89
correlates to how ripples would work but

2305.89 --> 2310.8689999999997
lights not a ripple because then beyond

2308.89 --> 2314.14
the double slit when you shine the light

2310.869 --> 2315.94
on it right if you change the distance

2314.14 --> 2318.3089999999997
then you would see

2315.94 --> 2320.92
that it is ripples indeed but it's not

2318.309 --> 2323.71
it's all straight beams that just split

2320.92 --> 2325.41
up in this very specific way every time

2323.71 --> 2328.39
every single time it's always that way

2325.41 --> 2330.2799999999997
that that type of split up and that has

2328.39 --> 2332.2
to do with yeah I call it that fraction

2330.28 --> 2333.94
cascade I don't know why it does that

2332.2 --> 2337.359
but it is a very specific pattern and

2333.94 --> 2342.819
that pattern does not make it a wave it

2337.359 --> 2345.0989999999997
just correlates to wave function but it

2342.819 --> 2347.579
is not that it's just the pattern seems

2345.099 --> 2350.5
very similar it's an astounding

2347.579 --> 2353.38
correlation and that is all that it is

2350.5 --> 2359.079
so light is not a wave it's never been a

2353.38 --> 2363.309
wave nobody nobody actually proved that

2359.079 --> 2365.8900000000003
light is a wave ever the light argument

2363.309 --> 2368.1090000000004
for me is like I'm an imperious sister I

2365.89 --> 2369.3689999999997
like to accept evidence of proof that we

2368.109 --> 2371.319
can demonstrate to be true

2369.369 --> 2373.03
I'm not even satisfied the light is a

2371.319 --> 2374.89
particle I know it's described as a

2373.03 --> 2376.63
massless particle but for me a massless

2374.89 --> 2377.98
particle is like having a hot cold drink

2376.63 --> 2379.69
or a cold hot drink you can have a

2377.98 --> 2380.17
massless particle it's contradiction in

2379.69 --> 2383.529
terms

2380.17 --> 2384.789
but I don't like the light either I

2383.529 --> 2386.17
don't know enough about it to be able to

2384.789 --> 2388.9300000000003
argue against it other than that I'm not

2386.17 --> 2391.299
satisfied that it's cool the problem is

2388.93 --> 2394.4199999999996
they call it a particle and we might

2391.299 --> 2398.14
they kind of politicize it they kind of

2394.42 --> 2402.279
like put its this is a very silly

2398.14 --> 2404.8289999999997
comparison for us but it is like taking

2402.279 --> 2406.96
the planet you know of the solar system

2404.829 --> 2409.0890000000004
then saying oh man I got this rock

2406.96 --> 2411.279
there's also floating there it's

2409.089 --> 2413.95
irregular but we're also gonna call it a

2411.279 --> 2416.92
planet it's kind of like that it's like

2413.95 --> 2419.3799999999997
yeah it's that to be part of it but it's

2416.92 --> 2421.63
not it's not like that at all it's

2419.38 --> 2424.9900000000002
completely different it doesn't have any

2421.63 --> 2427.839
mass and that claim that it is a

2424.99 --> 2430.4399999999996
particle what correlate with it being in

2427.839 --> 2434.529
the visible unit and within the visible

2430.44 --> 2437.349
the example would be of that is an atom

2434.529 --> 2439.39
or a molecule and a molecule a single

2437.349 --> 2442.4500000000003
molecule if you then split it up in any

2439.39 --> 2444.8489999999997
type of way whatever comes out of that

2442.45 --> 2447.6899999999996
is going to be nothing like the original

2444.849 --> 2449.29
material that it was that is like

2447.69 --> 2451.15
indivisible means that

2449.29 --> 2453.31
once you split it up at a certain point

2451.15 --> 2456.73
it's gonna be nothing like what it was

2453.31 --> 2458.89
it won't become the smaller version of

2456.73 --> 2461.29
itself anymore as well that is the

2458.89 --> 2464.68
particle concept really what it rests on

2461.29 --> 2467.29
and light is not that it doesn't seem

2464.68 --> 2468.8799999999997
like it is that at all it seems very

2467.29 --> 2472.6
much like it can be split up

2468.88 --> 2475.09
indefinitely it can just be split up and

2472.6 --> 2477.94
split up and split up and compact it and

2475.09 --> 2480.13
cross routing and doing all kinds of

2477.94 --> 2484.09
weird things but there yeah

2480.13 --> 2485.65
if light was an indivisible unit and it

2484.09 --> 2488.8
just couldn't be smaller than a certain

2485.65 --> 2493.03
amount of energy then how could super

2488.8 --> 2495.9100000000003
far away sites ever be possible without

2493.03 --> 2499.2000000000003
it blurring up because if everything was

2495.91 --> 2501.49
basically a resolution wise bound to a

2499.2 --> 2505.5699999999997
microscopic amount of light then

2501.49 --> 2507.6699999999996
eventually it's all gonna blow up even

2505.57 --> 2509.8590000000004
if you zoom in and all that it's like

2507.67 --> 2512.67
nothing would be visible so it just

2509.859 --> 2517.6
seems natural to me that light must be

2512.67 --> 2521.53
infinitely divisible in nature assuming

2517.6 --> 2524.29
it's physical no it's but it isn't it is

2521.53 --> 2527.17
light it is an energy it is it doesn't

2524.29 --> 2528.94
have mass does have the speed and I

2527.17 --> 2531.1
think it's a beam I prefer to call it a

2528.94 --> 2532.359
beam instead of going back to his fear

2531.1 --> 2536.0499999999997
because hey it's always pretty much

2532.359 --> 2538.42
gonna be a beam effectively not even

2536.05 --> 2540.04
visibly you know I'm alright with

2538.42 --> 2541.09
playing England on it I just don't I

2540.04 --> 2543.25
don't know what it is

2541.09 --> 2544.7200000000003
but I'm not satisfied that it's a

2543.25 --> 2546.7
particle because it doesn't seem to have

2544.72 --> 2549.3689999999997
any physical existence and if it is it's

2546.7 --> 2552.22
metaphysical a best and it's like I

2549.369 --> 2554.3500000000004
can't even argue no it's not a physical

2552.22 --> 2556.27
it's just that the only way we even

2554.35 --> 2560.29
registered the concept of light is

2556.27 --> 2562.81
through matter matter allows us to

2560.29 --> 2564.85
interact like the interaction of the

2562.81 --> 2568.81
light with the matter even establish a

2564.85 --> 2571.24
site in the first place and we can

2568.81 --> 2572.95
measure light by the minimum amount of

2571.24 --> 2575.7999999999997
interaction that's always going to be

2572.95 --> 2578.89
matter bound you know the actual amount

2575.8 --> 2581.2200000000003
of light could be smaller but yeah a

2578.89 --> 2585.0699999999997
molecule at some point can't

2581.22 --> 2587.4399999999996
without changing so even with very small

2585.07 --> 2590.38
molecules there would be like a minimum

2587.44 --> 2592.51
size limit for it in order to register

2590.38 --> 2595.09
as a single thing do you understand

2592.51 --> 2597.5800000000004
yeah it could technically be smaller but

2595.09 --> 2599.44
there's no way to register that bit with

2597.58 --> 2601.75
material because we're always bound to

2599.44 --> 2604.65
material in order to register the

2601.75 --> 2607.06
existence of light in the first place

2604.65 --> 2608.59
yeah I think there has to be physical I

2607.06 --> 2610.6
just don't think that we can detect it

2608.59 --> 2612.31
with anything that we've got because if

2610.6 --> 2614.29
it wasn't physical it wouldn't it would

2612.31 --> 2617.5299999999997
be a zero value but it asks something

2614.29 --> 2623.44
because it we see it energy is energy it

2617.53 --> 2628.3900000000003
is maybe very blatant can be energy it

2623.44 --> 2630.76
is a lot of energy so and yeah but we're

2628.39 --> 2634.15
always gonna be bound to matter in order

2630.76 --> 2637.26
to register it yeah that's just it

2634.15 --> 2640.57
that's the cap then the limit is matter

2637.26 --> 2643.36
that is the limit to light our knowledge

2640.57 --> 2646.15
because we are matter you know we can

2643.36 --> 2649.0
extrapolate we can calculate but as for

2646.15 --> 2653.44
the actual empirical proof it's gonna be

2649.0 --> 2658.109
bound by by the limits of matter that's

2653.44 --> 2658.109
just a fact it's a fact of science

2659.53 --> 2668.4100000000003
right amiracle action interaction or

2663.43 --> 2670.45
action always requires matter right and

2668.41 --> 2672.19
that's that if the problem is if there

2670.45 --> 2674.89
is a physical interaction but we can't

2672.19 --> 2675.94
we can't define what our physicality is

2674.89 --> 2679.15
because it doesn't seem to our

2675.94 --> 2680.53
physicality in our realm but it must be

2679.15 --> 2682.2400000000002
physical because we see something right

2680.53 --> 2684.67
but it doesn't seem to have any

2682.24 --> 2688.8399999999997
properties of physicality nobody out

2684.67 --> 2692.37
there's physical matter it energizes it

2688.84 --> 2695.04
it changes its molecular function

2692.37 --> 2698.38
there's all kinds of things that like us

2695.04 --> 2700.18
it introduces energy the sum of the

2698.38 --> 2702.6400000000003
energy of the light becomes absorbed by

2700.18 --> 2706.0
the matter it it goes through or it

2702.64 --> 2715.18
reflects off and others just continue on

2706.0 --> 2718.57
until it is all absorbed well whatever

2715.18 --> 2720.97
light is it remains a mystery is

2718.57 --> 2722.8900000000003
something it can't be nothing it has to

2720.97 --> 2724.66
our physicality in some way but we just

2722.89 --> 2727.6299999999997
don't have the form for it we just don't

2724.66 --> 2732.25
know what it is and I'm alright with

2727.63 --> 2735.4500000000003
that I am NOT being that modest I am

2732.25 --> 2739.18
pretty sure I know it is entity because

2735.45 --> 2740.98
interaction is energy so it is energy no

2739.18 --> 2743.7999999999997
I agree is energy I agree that it is

2740.98 --> 2748.15
matter but nobody does not matter matter

2743.8 --> 2750.13
is specifically defined by particles all

2748.15 --> 2754.84
that it's not substance it's not

2750.13 --> 2757.27
physical its energy you know don't don't

2754.84 --> 2758.8900000000003
go with all this philosophy nonsense

2757.27 --> 2760.86
that's been leaking out through the

2758.89 --> 2763.33
scientists in the community early on

2760.86 --> 2765.85
assuming that it's all the same light

2763.33 --> 2767.62
and energy like our energy and matter

2765.85 --> 2770.68
are the same thing that is all

2767.62 --> 2773.0499999999997
philosophy that is something there to

2770.68 --> 2774.79
confuse you so don't go with that I know

2773.05 --> 2781.9900000000002
I almost know that you were going to do

2774.79 --> 2784.17
that saying I don't know what it is and

2781.99 --> 2786.5499999999997
I'm okay not knowing I'm alright with I

2784.17 --> 2788.56
think the lights physical but I think

2786.55 --> 2791.1400000000003
it's a spectrum that we can't see do

2788.56 --> 2792.91
touch feel we can't prove but it has to

2791.14 --> 2795.22
be physical because we see it

2792.91 --> 2798.5499999999997
you can spawn it you know you can create

2795.22 --> 2801.43
light with matter by introducing for

2798.55 --> 2803.71
example energy like electric energy then

2801.43 --> 2806.02
you build up this energy in matter and

2803.71 --> 2810.46
then it starts to radiate this light

2806.02 --> 2816.07
that's how lamps work so but the light

2810.46 --> 2818.71
itself is basically secondary it is

2816.07 --> 2821.92
secondary to matter for us the way we

2818.71 --> 2825.31
can create it so the Sun yeah we don't

2821.92 --> 2828.76
know what is primary to that we just get

2825.31 --> 2831.04
the light from it so we only get the

2828.76 --> 2837.0400000000004
secondary wid that's why yeah it's such

2831.04 --> 2837.4
a mystery yeah well in any of its 500

2837.04 --> 2839.68
miles

2837.4 --> 2841.39
I just want to recreate Ramsey for not

2839.68 --> 2843.37
jumping the gun and not jumping into it

2841.39 --> 2845.3799999999997
feet first and making a mistake and I

2843.37 --> 2846.94
hope miles as the decency to credit Flat

2845.38 --> 2848.62
Earth for not jumping in because that's

2846.94 --> 2854.4700000000003
what really mean he needs to do we set a

2848.62 --> 2856.92
trap it didn't work and that's it let's

2854.47 --> 2856.9199999999996
see if he does

2864.11 --> 2868.5
so where have you had any interesting

2866.85 --> 2870.9
points in the last few days on fly

2868.5 --> 2874.13
a--the well mostly the Black Swan and

2870.9 --> 2877.08
the arguments that I've brought forward

2874.13 --> 2880.79
so like what I talked about the

2877.08 --> 2884.43
expansion of the the visual effect

2880.79 --> 2888.0299999999997
identification my personal knowledge and

2884.43 --> 2892.1699999999996
of course yeah the already kind of

2888.03 --> 2893.8500000000004
finished conceptual viewing of the

2892.17 --> 2895.53
difference between light and matter I've

2893.85 --> 2898.29
got that pretty much straight now as

2895.53 --> 2901.32
well there's no real progress beyond

2898.29 --> 2905.46
that it's just like yeah if you on a

2901.32 --> 2909.03
certain level that helps guide any

2905.46 --> 2910.5
potential inquiry or interest to get

2909.03 --> 2912.3300000000004
some misunderstandings out of the way

2910.5 --> 2914.46
because a lot there is a lot of

2912.33 --> 2917.19
misunderstanding because of the all the

2914.46 --> 2926.9700000000003
particle ization of everything within

2917.19 --> 2929.75
physics well would you be joining

2926.97 --> 2935.0099999999998
Nathan's in a bit yeah sure of course

2929.75 --> 2940.8
alright so yeah what's your next video

2935.01 --> 2943.1400000000003
Jodi I'm waiting for them to it somebody

2940.8 --> 2944.9100000000003
to address or admit or at least concede

2943.14 --> 2947.2799999999997
that the Black Swan argument is an

2944.91 --> 2948.87
argument of equivalence and it could be

2947.28 --> 2951.0600000000004
that we're on a flat plane and it always

2948.87 --> 2952.56
looks curved or it could be that we're

2951.06 --> 2955.29
on a curveball but it always seems to

2952.56 --> 2957.93
look flat but they won't concede and I'm

2955.29 --> 2960.69
like I'm gonna leave as my current video

2957.93 --> 2963.0899999999997
because it is the most important video

2960.69 --> 2964.35
at the moment I think I Iraq I accept

2963.09 --> 2966.48
that any of these borders are honest

2964.35 --> 2967.98
unless any of them can admit that this

2966.48 --> 2970.02
is an at least an argument of

2967.98 --> 2972.87
equivalence but not validity maybe I can

2970.02 --> 2974.88
help you out by inserting a certain

2972.87 --> 2977.67
suggestion to the baller community about

2974.88 --> 2980.88
how to respond to it okay you could

2977.67 --> 2982.7400000000002
always just say yeah that's really nice

2980.88 --> 2985.9500000000003
about the Black Swan but we never

2982.74 --> 2987.24
claimed there's only white swans yeah

2985.95 --> 2989.8199999999997
they do claim that there's only white

2987.24 --> 2991.74
swans though no but that's people like

2989.82 --> 2995.2000000000003
Brenda because they're just complete

2991.74 --> 2999.3999999999996
idiots they're always just complete bite

2995.2 --> 3002.46
the dumbest thing instantly but it could

2999.4 --> 3005.27
be argued like but we didn't claim that

3002.46 --> 3008.13
all swans are white yeah they do but

3005.27 --> 3010.83
they claims a restaurant refraction and

3008.13 --> 3012.9
it's all bending into a flat plane based

3010.83 --> 3015.84
on fictional optics that's really their

3012.9 --> 3018.51
foundation it's even they don't

3015.84 --> 3020.31
completely fully understand that yet not

3018.51 --> 3022.0800000000004
all of them because it is such a

3020.31 --> 3024.5099999999998
confusing thing it's such a confusing

3022.08 --> 3026.19
machination and we've been attacking

3024.51 --> 3027.5600000000004
their more and more on optics in the

3026.19 --> 3029.7000000000003
first place so it's a more difficult

3027.56 --> 3033.7799999999997
baseline argument but it is their

3029.7 --> 3037.3799999999997
baseline argument not that the horizon

3033.78 --> 3040.2000000000003
really is a jib yeah a geometrical

3037.38 --> 3042.3
horizon and of the visual horizon they

3040.2 --> 3044.37
just have been kind of they always

3042.3 --> 3046.53
double down like even if they know an

3044.37 --> 3049.71
argument is wrong they'll still go for

3046.53 --> 3051.7200000000003
it for a while because to them they've

3049.71 --> 3053.88
it almost seems like they're just keep

3051.72 --> 3057.27
on going and knowing they've lost and

3053.88 --> 3060.0
they just try to spend as much time or

3057.27 --> 3063.27
try to waste as much time of us as they

3060.0 --> 3065.33
can by doubling down on arguments that

3063.27 --> 3068.33
they already know they're gonna fail

3065.33 --> 3068.33
yeah

3068.84 --> 3072.63
I'm hoping that sort of Malaysian sea

3071.25 --> 3075.03
but openly well but they've got to

3072.63 --> 3077.34
really it has to be here sometimes it's

3075.03 --> 3078.96
flat but looks bent and other times it's

3077.34 --> 3080.19
bent but looks flat it has to be in

3078.96 --> 3085.44
equivalence arguments and they won't

3080.19 --> 3091.59
concede once the thing is the real Black

3085.44 --> 3095.34
Swan situation is is that the visual is

3091.59 --> 3098.7000000000003
so exceptional in a way that it can't

3095.34 --> 3101.1600000000003
work it completely gets out of the way

3098.7 --> 3103.1099999999997
the geometrical horizons versus to the

3101.16 --> 3106.62
actual horizon the optical horizon

3103.11 --> 3109.6800000000003
that's what it does and then yeah it

3106.62 --> 3111.66
exposes it forces terrestrial refraction

3109.68 --> 3114.54
to the foreground but then yeah we can

3111.66 --> 3117.87
definitely and we do respond with what

3114.54 --> 3119.25
are the real effects what are all the

3117.87 --> 3122.8199999999997
real mirages in effects all the

3119.25 --> 3124.65
refractions types and then show with

3122.82 --> 3127.53
quotations John's already doing this

3124.65 --> 3129.27
like yeah that's not real refraction

3127.53 --> 3131.9100000000003
it's a fictional construct it's an

3129.27 --> 3134.64
arm-based fictional thing yeah and we

3131.91 --> 3136.62
prove it so yeah but they're really

3134.64 --> 3138.99
screwed at this point they're losing

3136.62 --> 3141.81
some tools we're taking some toys away

3138.99 --> 3144.0
what the use they use the word

3141.81 --> 3145.95
refraction to include seven over six are

3144.0 --> 3147.42
and it doesn't include seven over six re

3145.95 --> 3150.33
include like John says it includes

3147.42 --> 3151.71
superior in fear FATA bromosa there are

3150.33 --> 3154.11
there are the effects of mirages in

3151.71 --> 3156.57
rites looming stooping none of them say

3154.11 --> 3158.13
seven over six are but they include that

3156.57 --> 3159.15
because they need to on their model the

3158.13 --> 3160.67
rape in the meaning of the word

3159.15 --> 3163.98
refraction that's what they're doing

3160.67 --> 3167.07
right well it's a new type of refraction

3163.98 --> 3170.52
it's an alternative type of science no

3167.07 --> 3171.4500000000003
it's called pseudoscience but that's why

3170.52 --> 3173.67
they alternate

3171.45 --> 3176.0099999999998
when you say alternative type of science

3173.67 --> 3177.96
that is basically at this point a

3176.01 --> 3179.9700000000003
euphemism for pseudoscience it's kind of

3177.96 --> 3182.9700000000003
implied even covertly

3179.97 --> 3185.06
would you agree alternative science is

3182.97 --> 3187.41
usually not it's usually not a good sign

3185.06 --> 3188.91
we shouldn't call it alternative science

3187.41 --> 3190.56
we should call it what it is I made it I

3188.91 --> 3193.67
usually don't call it an alternative

3190.56 --> 3197.16
science but it is a terminology you know

3193.67 --> 3199.32
it's many people just use made-up

3197.16 --> 3201.1499999999996
[ __ ] to justify using seven over six

3199.32 --> 3203.4900000000002
are to explain how it's not above but

3201.15 --> 3207.1800000000003
how it's a ball but doesn't appear to be

3203.49 --> 3209.37
a bowl that's what they're doing yeah

3207.18 --> 3213.56
well that's what all their machinations

3209.37 --> 3214.89
are designed to do go at your calculator

3213.56 --> 3216.6
yeah

3214.89 --> 3218.25
gone are the days when they've done

3216.6 --> 3219.69
things ooh we don't need to use them

3218.25 --> 3223.95
anymore it's like yeah you can't prove

3219.69 --> 3226.23
it [ __ ] all right and besides the

3223.95 --> 3229.71
curvature calculator literally does not

3226.23 --> 3232.98
take a visual horizon into account it

3229.71 --> 3234.96
literally doesn't it presumes only the

3232.98 --> 3237.48
geometrical horizon that is what the

3234.96 --> 3239.43
thing does yep and that's the main

3237.48 --> 3241.44
inherent problem in Boulder's Dulce and

3239.43 --> 3243.75
I'm like yeah that's the reason why were

3241.44 --> 3245.4900000000002
you guys stop raping the meaning of the

3243.75 --> 3248.19
word refraction and we can go away but

3245.49 --> 3250.5
you're gonna keep doing it right because

3248.19 --> 3253.29
refraction is basically the excuse they

3250.5 --> 3256.29
give afterwards after they applied the

3253.29 --> 3258.3
broken machination that show and that

3256.29 --> 3259.86
assumes it is a geometrical curve and

3258.3 --> 3261.46
then when the visuals basically don't

3259.86 --> 3264.9700000000003
correlate that's when they have to

3261.46 --> 3267.4
paint the wide palette of our based

3264.97 --> 3270.25
refraction over that and imagine that

3267.4 --> 3273.9900000000002
it's all visually displacing into a

3270.25 --> 3277.39
plane which it can't because that is

3273.99 --> 3278.04
optically impossible proven it's not how

3277.39 --> 3280.569
it works

3278.04 --> 3282.2799999999997
light doesn't follow a curved path it

3280.569 --> 3283.8089999999997
deviates from straight and they've got

3282.28 --> 3285.0400000000004
no evidence to prove that it does just

3283.809 --> 3286.21
make it up the rate in the meaning of

3285.04 --> 3291.15
the word refraction that's what they're

3286.21 --> 3296.44
doing but I even wonder for example if

3291.15 --> 3298.4500000000003
in 3d rendering programs if such an

3296.44 --> 3300.46
effect could technically even be

3298.45 --> 3303.9399999999996
emulated if it is mathematically

3300.46 --> 3305.7400000000002
possible to do that that that you would

3303.94 --> 3308.619
basically have a rate tracing setup of

3305.74 --> 3310.68
well you had have a literal ball earth

3308.619 --> 3314.829
and even maybe some features on it and

3310.68 --> 3316.5989999999997
then causing because hey you can program

3314.829 --> 3317.05
whatever effects you know if you're good

3316.599 --> 3321.9100000000003
at it

3317.05 --> 3325.0
then program the 6 / 7 / 6 are concepts

3321.91 --> 3327.5789999999997
that type of bending into the visuals

3325.0 --> 3330.13
see if you can make that earth look into

3327.579 --> 3333.69
a flat plane right I don't think that's

3330.13 --> 3333.69
probably gonna work out very well

3334.23 --> 3341.76
wouldn't you agree because debts must be

3338.29 --> 3346.42
extremely complex conceptually it is I

3341.76 --> 3349.0890000000004
it can be you can think about the

3346.42 --> 3351.339
concept that a ball could be bent into a

3349.089 --> 3355.0
flat layer you can even easily explain

3351.339 --> 3357.73
it but ii ii ii eclis do it to

3355.0 --> 3361.63
technically get the system actually

3357.73 --> 3364.18
doing that nah in a simulation I've

3361.63 --> 3366.549
never even seen on the tensor I heard

3364.18 --> 3368.2
about it no who's gonna try that he's

3366.549 --> 3370.42
coming I'm not gonna work out it's gonna

3368.2 --> 3372.9399999999996
get all warped it's gonna be nothing

3370.42 --> 3375.28
like real sight ever you can't make a

3372.94 --> 3378.19
ball flat that's like making a hot drink

3375.28 --> 3381.0400000000004
and ice pop you can't do it well we're

3378.19 --> 3382.27
not without a fridge yeah but even if

3381.04 --> 3384.4
you're a fridge you still can't make a

3382.27 --> 3386.71
hot drink in a fridge and ice pop it's

3384.4 --> 3388.6600000000003
still a hot drink in a fridge it's gonna

3386.71 --> 3390.4900000000002
cool down it's not gonna be sure drink

3388.66 --> 3391.27
any more but it's not it's not an ice

3390.49 --> 3392.859
pop though is it

3391.27 --> 3394.299
I mean you can make it a bit cool then

3392.859 --> 3395.299
you can claim that it's an ice pop but

3394.299 --> 3402.709
it don't make it an ice

3395.299 --> 3403.089
oh okay you see still gonna be a hot

3402.709 --> 3405.3489999999997
drink

3403.089 --> 3406.5789999999997
you have to distort it you have to rape

3405.349 --> 3410.569
the meaning of the word hot drink to

3406.579 --> 3413.8900000000003
make it into a nice pop yeah I get where

3410.569 --> 3416.989
you're going it's the best of examples

3413.89 --> 3419.3289999999997
well if you could you know you can a

3416.989 --> 3422.239
nice pop is basically you put a stick in

3419.329 --> 3424.159
anything liquid into a container thingy

3422.239 --> 3427.459
and then you put it in the fridge well

3424.159 --> 3430.1890000000003
technically you can make a tea ice if

3427.459 --> 3431.509
you want so a hot drink could be tea and

3430.189 --> 3435.4089999999997
you could put it in the fridge and it

3431.509 --> 3438.799
would still be a popsicle afterward it

3435.409 --> 3439.549
would BNT popsicle that you made you

3438.799 --> 3442.64
need a freezer

3439.549 --> 3446.059
yeah no fridge oh they put the hot drink

3442.64 --> 3449.269
in the fridge and clay oh oh wait right

3446.059 --> 3451.969
oh that's my mistake yeah yeah oh that's

3449.269 --> 3454.5789999999997
what I'm saying then together a freezer

3451.969 --> 3456.739
I think that I just call it like that

3454.579 --> 3457.969
yeah yeah yeah so they get a little bit

3456.739 --> 3459.259
of cooling from the fridge and claim

3457.969 --> 3461.599
that it's an ice pop and it's like no

3459.259 --> 3464.479
[ __ ] it's still hot drinking right

3461.599 --> 3466.699
right yeah I thought you're like yeah

3464.479 --> 3469.759
yeah I understand my misunderstanding

3466.699 --> 3471.0190000000002
there sure yeah but what I'm trying to

3469.759 --> 3472.219
show you is that they get a little bit

3471.019 --> 3474.709
of cool and then think that it's an ice

3472.219 --> 3476.659
pop and it's like no [ __ ] no it's

3474.709 --> 3478.009
just a little bit cooler yeah it's just

3476.659 --> 3479.2090000000003
cooling that's like having the fan on in

3478.009 --> 3481.189
the middle of the desert and thinking

3479.209 --> 3482.569
that you cold it's like no just because

3481.189 --> 3484.219
you got a little bit of bendy light that

3482.569 --> 3491.619
helps you a little bit periodically

3484.219 --> 3496.18
don't make it flat India yep yeah

3491.619 --> 3498.849
they're gonna keep on going though and I

3496.18 --> 3502.719
think that I think personally that in

3498.849 --> 3504.9990000000003
this year like fear porn in itself is

3502.719 --> 3506.849
gonna be more exposed wouldn't you agree

3504.999 --> 3511.4489999999996
not necessarily even through Flat Earth

3506.849 --> 3514.3590000000004
well I'm wondering the concept of fear

3511.449 --> 3517.329
porn about hyping up things through

3514.359 --> 3518.799
media that are potentially dubious there

3517.329 --> 3521.17
has already been a long thing about

3518.799 --> 3523.63
false flag concepts and conspiracy

3521.17 --> 3527.38
theories about that with some legitimacy

3523.63 --> 3529.839
right and I think that the concept of

3527.38 --> 3533.079
fair porn is now starting to move into

3529.839 --> 3534.729
the among the more simple people even

3533.079 --> 3537.9390000000003
they're starting to really get it now

3534.729 --> 3540.3089999999997
like this is you don't listen to that

3537.939 --> 3543.939
because it's fear porn I think that it's

3540.309 --> 3546.9390000000003
gonna 2020 is gonna change the social

3543.939 --> 3549.939
landscape because of this and fear porn

3546.939 --> 3553.299
advocates on media are gonna hype it

3549.939 --> 3557.979
more up than ever people that will buy

3553.299 --> 3559.719
will go crazy absolutely I think this

3557.979 --> 3561.459
thing in China with this virus

3559.719 --> 3564.5190000000002
I think the fee upon in the [ __ ] are

3561.459 --> 3566.89
like yeah I wanna I think that's the

3564.519 --> 3569.14
first one this year well not entirely

3566.89 --> 3570.759
true because even the Iran situation was

3569.14 --> 3575.17
kind of the first one so there's just a

3570.759 --> 3577.779
lot of use like everything that happens

3575.17 --> 3579.91
or they create a couple of things and

3577.779 --> 3582.91
they they try to use everything they can

3579.91 --> 3584.319
to just insert as much fear as they can

3582.91 --> 3589.449
more than they used to

3584.319 --> 3591.88
I agree to anything but people are at

3589.449 --> 3593.529
the same time it is almost a sign like

3591.88 --> 3596.1400000000003
they're doing it because it's not really

3593.529 --> 3597.999
working anymore because the general

3596.14 --> 3600.429
public is now starting to wake up to it

3597.999 --> 3603.519
I think they're doing it because they

3600.429 --> 3605.92
want to issue or implement a mass

3603.519 --> 3607.1789999999996
vaccination of some kind because they

3605.92 --> 3608.679
want everyone scared that they're gonna

3607.179 --> 3610.39
get this illness and they're all gonna

3608.679 --> 3612.279
get injected because of it but I think

3610.39 --> 3615.069
that's exactly I'm gonna give them the

3612.279 --> 3616.779
that's what it does yeah yeah you get an

3615.069 --> 3621.0589999999997
injection you know the a few family who

3616.779 --> 3621.059
end up dying or at least ill

3622.75 --> 3628.34
if your phone is via Pony strife in the

3626.27 --> 3630.82
in the media just send the tally off and

3628.34 --> 3633.8900000000003
then there's no fear anymore now yeah

3630.82 --> 3638.15
indeed but I do want to keep track kind

3633.89 --> 3640.7
of of what is said and I also for me it

3638.15 --> 3644.35
is really at this point I just I'm so

3640.7 --> 3646.79
curious to analyze the finer things in

3644.35 --> 3650.21
identifying how they are putting down

3646.79 --> 3653.0299999999997
the illusion you know it's like I'm

3650.21 --> 3655.28
interested in the spell casting it's a

3653.03 --> 3657.9500000000003
wizard stuff literally it is wizard

3655.28 --> 3661.0400000000004
stuff fear porn is wizard stuff Mead

3657.95 --> 3662.8999999999996
your name but I'm just I'm fascinating

3661.04 --> 3664.73
with like how they're putting down the

3662.9 --> 3668.3
story because I bet that a lot of people

3664.73 --> 3670.88
do no way it is kind of overblown the

3668.3 --> 3673.5800000000004
ones that are much more controlled about

3670.88 --> 3675.26
themselves they probably do know it but

3673.58 --> 3680.2999999999997
they're still going with it because of

3675.26 --> 3681.98
whatever contracts or business yes if

3680.3 --> 3686.69
you control the media you control the

3681.98 --> 3688.31
fie upon't yep anyway it's like it's

3686.69 --> 3689.63
like most ballers won't work except that

3688.31 --> 3691.0099999999998
the earth might be flat unless they see

3689.63 --> 3692.3
you on telly and even if they see I'm

3691.01 --> 3694.46
telling these still they'll still

3692.3 --> 3695.78
struggle to accept it because just the

3694.46 --> 3698.02
brainwashed and they just don't realize

3695.78 --> 3698.02
it

3698.05 --> 3705.1090000000004
yeah well originally most ballers tend

3703.04 --> 3707.57
to respond I think when they see such

3705.109 --> 3710.0
things in media that's like when they

3707.57 --> 3712.1600000000003
see ball thinks it's like yeah duh they

3710.0 --> 3714.38
get it that's their respond it's like ah

3712.16 --> 3716.5699999999997
finally they get it it's a ball yeah

3714.38 --> 3719.4700000000003
that's it but when they see something

3716.57 --> 3723.02
flat earthy or some kind of hint or even

3719.47 --> 3726.29
dry hint it's like mmm they're trying to

3723.02 --> 3728.869
troll us with Flat Earth that's probably

3726.29 --> 3731.63
the average bowler response though these

3728.869 --> 3732.92
types of things in movies yeah but when

3731.63 --> 3735.5
they do that though that's like all

3732.92 --> 3739.34
saying nasara tryna trolls with [ __ ]

3735.5 --> 3740.98
yeah fake its fake uh-huh yeah but they

3739.34 --> 3744.9500000000003
we don't really want to know about that

3740.98 --> 3747.35
and besides a lot of ballers probably do

3744.95 --> 3749.6299999999997
suspect like yeah NASA is kind of

3747.35 --> 3751.27
fooling us but that doesn't mean space

3749.63 --> 3755.7400000000002
is not real though to them

3751.27 --> 3757.5099999999998
you know it's like I ten years ago Pete

3755.74 --> 3759.2799999999997
means a person I thought it's like yeah

3757.51 --> 3760.9300000000003
I knew like yeah that seems like NASA is

3759.28 --> 3762.2200000000003
like screwing around you know this is

3760.93 --> 3764.71
very unlikely that they're actually

3762.22 --> 3769.66
doing that and this fooling around with

3764.71 --> 3771.73
CGI now that so when is somebody gonna

3769.66 --> 3774.49
finally replace them do I need to

3771.73 --> 3777.94
replace them to get it right that was

3774.49 --> 3780.7299999999996
what I that was me see so I kind of knew

3777.94 --> 3784.119
it's like yeah but I still thought like

3780.73 --> 3786.58
yeah they're just screwing us we could

3784.119 --> 3790.33
probably do it and that's actually I

3786.58 --> 3792.46
figured I'd like wait oh it can't really

3790.33 --> 3796.21
it's not possible mm-hmm

3792.46 --> 3799.48
I didn't know how many lies does want us

3796.21 --> 3800.89
to tell and be caught out on before

3799.48 --> 3801.4900000000002
ballers will realize that they're being

3800.89 --> 3803.1099999999997
lied to

3801.49 --> 3805.39
slightly don't want it's like it's like

3803.11 --> 3807.46
the the the the woman that knows that

3805.39 --> 3809.3199999999997
husband's cheating or whatever and turns

3807.46 --> 3812.41
a blind eye to it even though she hates

3809.32 --> 3814.6000000000004
it or whatever yeah I just don't

3812.41 --> 3819.49
understand how they can still love NASA

3814.6 --> 3822.16
it's like crazy well because they are

3819.49 --> 3827.83
storytellers and everybody likes a good

3822.16 --> 3829.06
