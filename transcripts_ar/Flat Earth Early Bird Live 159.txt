43.129 --> 51.269
good morning welcome to Flat Earth

46.92 --> 58.079
early-bird number 159 I'm your host

51.269 --> 60.809
Arwen and today yah-ha I really have to

58.079 --> 63.21
refigure this routine but before I start

60.809 --> 65.12899999999999
all that please subscribe to my channel

63.21 --> 67.35
and hit the bell notification so you

65.129 --> 73.17
know when I'm going live today's that

67.35 --> 76.1
just a tiny bit early and please also

73.17 --> 79.229
support me through the Super chats

76.1 --> 85.759
through my paypal and subscribe to my

79.229 --> 89.789
patreon so today is a hot day I love it

85.759 --> 92.759
it's awesome it's very beautiful very

89.789 --> 95.909
warm barely any wind and the wind is

92.759 --> 99.96
warm as well unfortunately though there

95.909 --> 102.57000000000001
are some chemtrails yeah that is what a

99.96 --> 109.19999999999999
chem trail looks like that's not a

102.57 --> 111.24
contrail just saying oh well this vital

109.2 --> 113.96900000000001
that aids really nice and warm it's

111.24 --> 116.399
almost a summers day start it's starting

113.969 --> 121.02
to remind me now of spring from last

116.399 --> 125.09
year I went for groceries all in my

121.02 --> 125.09
t-shirt and it was really nice so

127.519 --> 132.37900000000002
so that's you isn't yet

139.24 --> 147.54000000000002
right so if Steve Juan Carlos Emmerich's

144.25 --> 155.43
j-mac righteous force

147.54 --> 158.79999999999998
glasha Obama call James Mason

155.43 --> 160.20000000000002
Jonathan Doherty mark of Melbourne good

158.8 --> 168.18
to see you all

160.2 --> 168.17999999999998
101 rockhound mi UK hello guys girls

172.14 --> 177.64999999999998
James Mason I don't know where slick is

177.8 --> 186.78
yeah I got pissed off at slick yesterday

180.78 --> 188.25
and because I was just trying to keep

186.78 --> 193.5
some middle ground and that guy just

188.25 --> 197.13
keeps on attacking me very persistently

193.5 --> 199.459
suddenly choosing that snoot image for

197.13 --> 203.88
me and it's getting really annoying

199.459 --> 206.64000000000001
because he seems like a very OneNote guy

203.88 --> 210.32999999999998
at that and it's starting to piss me off

206.64 --> 212.22
and besides other people are doing it as

210.33 --> 217.83
well like for example flatten earth

212.22 --> 219.959
snipe somebody right slick doesn't now

217.83 --> 223.02
start attacking him no it's personal

219.959 --> 225.69
because what I'm suspecting more and

223.02 --> 228.66
more is that all this experience

225.69 --> 233.79
non-belief talk for all of that the guy

228.66 --> 238.56
is pretty damn egotistical like for real

233.79 --> 242.67
and if you attack him personally he gets

238.56 --> 244.23
really pissed off like face-to-face to

242.67 --> 246.78
be honest I wouldn't even do that

244.23 --> 251.34
because I think he's a guy that would

246.78 --> 255.12
lose control it's that bad I think it's

251.34 --> 256.56
really creepy angry in a way that

255.12 --> 259.019
doesn't make any sense it's very

256.56 --> 264.54
threatening he's very each attempts to

259.019 --> 266.28000000000003
intimidate people it's annoying and he

264.54 --> 268.83000000000004
really doesn't have anything to bring to

266.28 --> 272.84
the table bunch of superficial analysis

268.83 --> 276.32
over generalizations the move to do

272.84 --> 278.78999999999996
whatever he wants his experience to be

276.32 --> 281.03
I'm not getting anything out of it

278.79 --> 281.03000000000003
really

284.29 --> 300.52000000000004
yeah I bet he does love the sound of his

287.02 --> 302.74
own voice Nathan seems to like it or

300.52 --> 305.89
maybe he just likes ruffling feathers

302.74 --> 312.25
and not being the one to personally do

305.89 --> 314.8
it I know Nathan I kind of regarded

312.25 --> 318.49
Nathan to be like that he's a he's

314.8 --> 325.3
trolling in nature it likes to see

318.49 --> 328.08
people get get pushed around so they

325.3 --> 334.39
show their character that's it basically

328.08 --> 336.60999999999996
it's not even malevolent it's just yeah

334.39 --> 340.0
it's not a good character trait but it's

336.61 --> 342.01
not malevolent or anything I don't think

340.0 --> 343.84
he plans these things it's just like oh

342.01 --> 346.12
hey this seems to happen that's kind of

343.84 --> 349.15
funny let's keep it that way that's what

346.12 --> 352.38
he does it's how we deal with the

349.15 --> 356.59
ballers anyway and he's just probably

352.38 --> 364.21
adapting that to all sides also I think

356.59 --> 366.66999999999996
Nathan is not trying to patronize him or

364.21 --> 368.5
anything in any way but I think Nathan

366.67 --> 370.75
is getting a little bit more trouble

368.5 --> 373.9
keeping oversight and this may also just

370.75 --> 377.41
have to do with him being severely

373.9 --> 380.65
distracted by his new daughter being

377.41 --> 382.27000000000004
born and everything will change and he's

380.65 --> 385.0
gone that's gonna take up a lot of his

382.27 --> 387.34
attention so maybe he's just doesn't

385.0 --> 390.58
have his mind all to it but he seems to

387.34 --> 393.4
just act more and more like oh yeah yeah

390.58 --> 395.72999999999996
as long as it keeps going it's all fine

393.4 --> 395.72999999999996
and

396.72 --> 402.03900000000004
I'm kind of shocked though that he would

399.25 --> 405.37
just completely outright ridicule my

402.039 --> 408.58
rectangular looping concept I thought it

405.37 --> 411.639
was weird like that I would suggest the

408.58 --> 416.85999999999996
Antarctic could be angular wise all

411.639 --> 422.52
surmounted a mounted it would be a zero

416.86 --> 425.83000000000004
degree wall a straight wall and he just

422.52 --> 428.54999999999995
ridiculing Li rejected that and I don't

425.83 --> 433.0
know I didn't I felt like he just

428.55 --> 439.36
couldn't get there so it was a defensive

433.0 --> 441.009
maneuver but yeah I already explained

439.36 --> 446.47
why I think that is

441.009 --> 449.71000000000004
it's just can't muster the focus because

446.47 --> 453.31
yeah his family you know logos and I

449.71 --> 455.56
totally agree you know to be fair like

453.31 --> 457.06
if I had the possibility if I were him

455.56 --> 462.699
in this case I would probably even

457.06 --> 467.25
completely quit YouTube for a while but

462.699 --> 470.91900000000004
he might be yeah - lured by the

467.25 --> 472.81
financial aspects of it in some way oh

470.919 --> 475.12
yeah and you have to maintain your

472.81 --> 477.07
audience and all that and he's invested

475.12 --> 478.75
so much I probably figured figures that

477.07 --> 481.9
you just can't do it and just do it like

478.75 --> 487.75
this but anyway this is me nosing around

481.9 --> 491.73999999999995
about what nathan is doing I don't know

487.75 --> 494.099
maybe you'll hear this yeah I totally

491.74 --> 496.719
respect you dude don't worry about it

494.099 --> 501.159
but yeah you're a human being and

496.719 --> 504.729
everyone has their minor or major flaws

501.159 --> 509.159
and the minor are not are usually very

504.729 --> 509.159
subtle but I do take notice

511.56 --> 516.659
[Music]

513.659 --> 516.659
anyway

519.45 --> 528.45
right 1 1 or Oh double Oh Piper 18,000

526.19 --> 531.0
the winter seasons in the Flat Earth

528.45 --> 533.88
model well doesn't really even matter

531.0 --> 537.87
what model it is in any model the

533.88 --> 545.899
seasons are directly driven by the Sun

537.87 --> 545.899
and Moon season cycles there's different

546.62 --> 550.05
the Sun just changes and the moon does

549.63 --> 552.87
too

550.05 --> 556.62
and it's pretty abruptly from what we

552.87 --> 560.899
can detect every time as in as this

556.62 --> 564.449
season officially changes celestial wise

560.899 --> 566.639
the Sun would go under at some spot in

564.449 --> 568.4699999999999
the last way it would be have a certain

566.639 --> 572.399
type of intensity and all that a

568.47 --> 575.24
specific angle path and then the first

572.399 --> 578.31
moment it pops up again somewhere else

575.24 --> 580.94
or yeah or if you would move with it

578.31 --> 584.43
it's likely to just subtly change

580.94 --> 585.87
suddenly change its trajectory it would

584.43 --> 588.269
look different and it would be pretty

585.87 --> 592.82
abrupt just like I've been has been

588.269 --> 596.19
detected with the moon switches all that

592.82 --> 598.1700000000001
so that is what drives the seasons and

596.19 --> 602.1600000000001
it has actually nothing to do with the

598.17 --> 607.079
shape of the earth except for how this

602.16 --> 612.0889999999999
seasonal regions are divided with the

607.079 --> 614.3599999999999
function that's it and it can work on

612.089 --> 614.36
anything

623.11 --> 626.44
[Music]

625.17 --> 628.75
all right

626.44 --> 634.69
so technically what I'm saying is that

628.75 --> 637.68
the seasons are mostly caused by the

634.69 --> 641.7700000000001
celestial cycles of the Sun and the moon

637.68 --> 643.75
that's specifically what I'm saying so

641.77 --> 646.17
even though the Sun and the moon are all

643.75 --> 649.12
a graphic all that light and the

646.17 --> 653.9799999999999
interaction it has with the earth that

649.12 --> 656.44
changes and it causes temperatures to

653.98 --> 658.839
change and how everything interacts and

656.44 --> 661.36
that causes all the season effects and

658.839 --> 664.08
the nature responding to it so that's my

661.36 --> 664.08
explanation

681.27 --> 689.67
well our Reno Columbo the thing is yeah

686.55 --> 691.26
you've been taught it's all heliocentric

689.67 --> 693.209
induced but that story's pretty

691.26 --> 696.51
ridiculous really look into it it is

693.209 --> 698.959
really ridiculous and all the angular

696.51 --> 700.92
things don't add up angular size

698.959 --> 703.3199999999999
elements it doesn't add up

700.92 --> 707.7299999999999
and especially the upper up changes I

703.32 --> 712.339
base my framework it's now just a

707.73 --> 718.5
framework basically but it on data on

712.339 --> 722.339
measured real data and yeah I have a

718.5 --> 725.82
whole bunch of data or data that I trust

722.339 --> 727.5600000000001
exists because it is measurable like the

725.82 --> 729.089
angular relations with the heavenly

727.56 --> 732.7199999999999
bodies in accordance to the earth and

729.089 --> 735.4100000000001
how these season cycles of the Sun and

732.72 --> 735.4100000000001
the moon change

744.839 --> 750.7900000000001
and that's what I'm attempting a

748.0 --> 754.05
framework modeling attempts yet that

750.79 --> 754.05
that's what I'm doing with that

769.51 --> 772.51
hmm

777.47 --> 783.26
right Rena one rock on I haven't seen

780.47 --> 788.15
that debates with the astrophysicist and

783.26 --> 793.67
mark sergeant Jesse Lee's Peterson's

788.15 --> 799.13
show yeah it's a problem a lot of

793.67 --> 804.1899999999999
flat-earthers speak out their opinion as

799.13 --> 807.35
it is everyone's and since my personal

804.19 --> 812.6300000000001
pursuit my model pursuit directing is a

807.35 --> 814.61
looping concept is so astray from what

812.63 --> 820.01
most people conceptualize the flat earth

814.61 --> 822.44
to be like I'm very careful and I always

820.01 --> 824.42
have to defend it basically to be my

822.44 --> 827.9000000000001
concept and what it is and what it is

824.42 --> 831.3499999999999
not yeah if you're gonna stick to with a

827.9 --> 833.63
very standard model concept it is with

831.35 --> 836.03
the dome which wide variety of people

833.63 --> 840.32
believe in then you're more inclined to

836.03 --> 842.63
over generalize that but that'll still

840.32 --> 845.5
be representing like a majority is

842.63 --> 850.97
almost like a political or philosophical

845.5 --> 853.46
majority and I think that a lot of

850.97 --> 855.4100000000001
people do agree among flat earthers with

853.46 --> 859.1500000000001
mark sergeant they may not like his

855.41 --> 864.38
character or some of them may not for

859.15 --> 868.0
wild reasons if you're disco Dan you're

864.38 --> 868.0
probably gonna end up agreeing with him

871.59 --> 878.36
no Orinoco bumble I that you got me

876.779 --> 881.55
totally wrong

878.36 --> 886.2
ain't no weld not the first part I I am

881.55 --> 886.8
not lying but I am indeed making stuff

886.2 --> 891.38
up

886.8 --> 894.3299999999999
that's right it's called constructing

891.38 --> 898.01
constructing with data conceptualizing

894.33 --> 901.23
making a framework figuring it out

898.01 --> 906.26
it's what engineers don't do with

901.23 --> 909.9
physical things I do it with concepts

906.26 --> 913.22
it's alternative cosmogony it is what a

909.9 --> 917.4599999999999
lot of the astrophysicists do with the

913.22 --> 919.71
heliocentric universe I do it with the

917.46 --> 922.95
data that is available to me to keep me

919.71 --> 928.83
honest and then try to conceptualize a

922.95 --> 931.83
framework for all that and be super

928.83 --> 934.6800000000001
honest about it that's what I'm doing

931.83 --> 936.57
I'm trying to do the same as what the

934.68 --> 938.8199999999999
astrophysics is doing except for all the

936.57 --> 941.57
presupposition of [ __ ] there's a

938.82 --> 944.5500000000001
couple of presuppositions that are in my

941.57 --> 948.38
concept but the thing is they can be

944.55 --> 951.3299999999999
proven or at least indirectly be proven

948.38 --> 954.3
that's a big difference and you don't

951.33 --> 957.63
have to go to speech and not be able to

954.3 --> 964.4599999999999
reach it this is doable very much doable

957.63 --> 967.5
on the earth so that's the difference

964.46 --> 969.5400000000001
mine has more hope for the

967.5 --> 972.33
presuppositions to actually turn out to

969.54 --> 975.48
be real even though they seemed very

972.33 --> 978.2900000000001
surreal to most people at this moment

975.48 --> 982.23
because they're used to heliocentric

978.29 --> 987.75
thinking or at least physicality

982.23 --> 992.139
assumption bias and yet my concepts

987.75 --> 994.589
tantor yeah straight from those

992.139 --> 994.589
assumptions

1002.189 --> 1011.079
come on Orinoco I addressed I addressed

1006.999 --> 1015.029
your questions in detail it's a rather

1011.079 --> 1015.029
sloppy response here from you

1020.82 --> 1025.3500000000001
[Music]

1022.819 --> 1030.6299999999999
noloty

1025.35 --> 1033.1989999999998
there is no curvature concave was fear

1030.63 --> 1033.199
equalize

1054.48 --> 1068.23
nay nay el junco LUN Canadian a donkey I

1064.8 --> 1071.83
don't really look into rich rhetoric I

1068.23 --> 1073.51
he is one of the most annoying trolls

1071.83 --> 1076.4499999999998
I've ever encountered I've encountered

1073.51 --> 1079.18
him plenty of times in the first year

1076.45 --> 1084.55
when I tried doing stuff he's just a

1079.18 --> 1087.25
very he gets under my skin

1084.55 --> 1090.61
he's painful to deal with like I have

1087.25 --> 1092.86
the same ease like a rumpus but he's

1090.61 --> 1098.04
much more sadistic rumpus is kind of

1092.86 --> 1101.5
amusing he's really an actor naturally

1098.04 --> 1104.8
it's very convinced in his acting and in

1101.5 --> 1110.52
this in his ritual but reg rhetoric I

1104.8 --> 1116.76
think he's genuinely a terrible person

1110.52 --> 1116.76
very own logos very very unload us

1120.05 --> 1123.1499999999999
[Music]

1124.95 --> 1133.27
and I just don't want to have anything

1128.26 --> 1135.84
to do with him in general I tried it it

1133.27 --> 1135.84
sucks

1136.82 --> 1141.53
and there's a couple of other people

1138.62 --> 1144.8899999999999
like this by the way having the same

1141.53 --> 1147.56
sensations with but they're not as

1144.89 --> 1152.17
terrible as him this guy knows no shame

1147.56 --> 1152.1699999999998
he's he's like a borderline ER at that

1161.13 --> 1169.14
I don't maybe he's changed

1166.41 --> 1171.51
who knows I literally haven't watched

1169.14 --> 1172.14
anything related to him in over two

1171.51 --> 1175.83
years

1172.14 --> 1178.26
ever I just hear him being mentioned

1175.83 --> 1182.01
sometimes during the debates by Nathan

1178.26 --> 1183.87
or whatever but I literally don't even

1182.01 --> 1189.02
pay attention I'm just blotting him out

1183.87 --> 1189.02
like I don't care about that guy at all

1192.68 --> 1195.93
[Music]

1202.96 --> 1215.3600000000001
Jason mcCormick that doesn't make any

1205.78 --> 1224.87
damn sense at all at all no matter how

1215.36 --> 1229.03
you slice it seriously if if the earth

1224.87 --> 1229.03
was concave there would be no vacuum

1229.39 --> 1234.3200000000002
never ever have you ever looked at my

1232.46 --> 1237.77
video very early on in a flat earth

1234.32 --> 1239.78
talks where I described once that it in

1237.77 --> 1242.84
my time where I was trying to attempt to

1239.78 --> 1247.16
prove gravity that if you have a

1242.84 --> 1250.1599999999999
centrifuge closed off and you let it

1247.16 --> 1253.429
spin at astronomical speeds insane

1250.16 --> 1255.919
speeds there is not going to be a vacuum

1253.429 --> 1259.8500000000001
at the center of it no matter how strong

1255.919 --> 1262.5400000000002
that force is the air pressure is going

1259.85 --> 1266.3899999999999
to be extremely thick compared to the

1262.54 --> 1269.75
center point as in a gradient but it's

1266.39 --> 1272.5700000000002
never gonna create a vacuum ever so this

1269.75 --> 1276.23
ridiculous to suggest that in a concave

1272.57 --> 1280.059
earth there would be vacuum naturally

1276.23 --> 1280.059
that's just absolutely ridiculous

1284.37 --> 1289.76
and yeah it's just not gonna happen

1295.44 --> 1303.77
well Vivian darkbloom I'm financially

1299.31 --> 1306.86
stable enough but I'm not exactly

1303.77 --> 1310.62
wealthy if you know what I mean and I do

1306.86 --> 1313.1699999999998
ask a lot of help financially from

1310.62 --> 1318.1799999999998
people and not just on YouTube so you

1313.17 --> 1321.0600000000002
know in that sense yeah I am kind of a

1318.18 --> 1325.6200000000001
beggar it's really annoying it's better

1321.06 --> 1329.54
to be honest about it at least I try to

1325.62 --> 1334.1599999999999
entertain and I do help people for free

1329.54 --> 1334.1599999999999
with my knowledge whenever I can

1336.29 --> 1344.57
especially if they're asking so that's

1341.19 --> 1344.5700000000002
what I have to give a return

1371.98 --> 1378.73
yeah Oh Yunker everyone pretty much

1376.029 --> 1382.149
knows that knows me knows where I live

1378.73 --> 1384.1
I'm open about it I've even been doxed

1382.149 --> 1387.2199999999998
earlier in the debates pretty

1384.1 --> 1389.08
extensively so yeah I live in Utrecht in

1387.22 --> 1391.48
the Netherlands it's not my place of

1389.08 --> 1397.99
birth I've been living here for five

1391.48 --> 1400.799
years now a lot of people live and have

1397.99 --> 1404.59
lived in Utrecht because it's a giant

1400.799 --> 1407.37
living City it's a residential city

1404.59 --> 1407.37
mostly

1420.49 --> 1428.129
ah okay

1423.779 --> 1432.45
well I'll youngja thanks for subscribing

1428.129 --> 1434.9089999999999
to my channel sorry if I can be a little

1432.45 --> 1437.519
bit harsh sometimes because the problem

1434.909 --> 1441.96
is if I get new people that subscribe to

1437.519 --> 1445.32
me and they don't have some specially a

1441.96 --> 1449.299
special icon that they made I tend to

1445.32 --> 1453.119
think that there are sock accounts it's

1449.299 --> 1456.389
it's a pre-emptive response from dealing

1453.119 --> 1459.899
with so many trolls and especially if

1456.389 --> 1462.089
you get very confronting somehow in a

1459.899 --> 1464.849
not so subtle way then I really think

1462.089 --> 1467.519
you're a troll so if you bring a red

1464.849 --> 1470.57
rhetoric in like like oh god a lot of

1467.519 --> 1473.3990000000001
trolls out there do try to chill

1470.57 --> 1476.07
basically for these baller channels try

1473.399 --> 1479.7589999999998
to look cool they made some video we

1476.07 --> 1482.849
talked shitty about you like screw you

1479.759 --> 1485.429
I'm not even gonna watch that video it's

1482.849 --> 1490.109
so everything that comes from all these

1485.429 --> 1494.659
people is just [ __ ] or just highly

1490.109 --> 1497.6689999999999
highly offensive even on a sensory level

1494.659 --> 1501.239
but yeah if I get just new people in

1497.669 --> 1504.21
there in my chat and I don't recognize

1501.239 --> 1506.219
them I can be kind of harsh at the

1504.21 --> 1508.32
beginning because I presume that you're

1506.219 --> 1509.999
a troll but yeah you obviously have

1508.32 --> 1514.9189999999999
identified as a real person

1509.999 --> 1515.82
to me now so thanks for for joining the

1514.919 --> 1519.45
Flat Earth

1515.82 --> 1523.32
early bird show if you have any more

1519.45 --> 1526.0800000000002
questions especially Flat Earth or

1523.32 --> 1528.57
cosmogony related or my rectangular

1526.08 --> 1535.369
looping concept or the holographic skies

1528.57 --> 1537.6899999999998
or the optical slant concept ask away

1535.369 --> 1539.7289999999998
that's what I do that's what I hope to

1537.69 --> 1541.529
do although mostly I just seem to be

1539.729 --> 1543.3590000000002
staring at chat and seeing how people

1541.529 --> 1545.57
are just interacting with one another

1543.359 --> 1548.849
and having all these wide discussions or

1545.57 --> 1552.089
being totally silly that seems to be how

1548.849 --> 1554.03
I'm spending most of my time during the

1552.089 --> 1557.87
early bird show

1554.03 --> 1563.72
yeah but I'm also very much here to

1557.87 --> 1567.4099999999999
answer questions even personal ones hmm

1563.72 --> 1571.48
Oh God hmm that's a good question but

1567.41 --> 1574.28
Jesus yeah

1571.48 --> 1577.76
it's literally as I predicted it's gone

1574.28 --> 1581.18
completely wild all the conspiracy about

1577.76 --> 1583.31
it and it's to be expected if they're

1581.18 --> 1585.44
gonna do the same thing as they did with

1583.31 --> 1590.48
Christ Church and just completely cut

1585.44 --> 1592.76
off media and just know this is this is

1590.48 --> 1599.18
what happened and nobody gets to see

1592.76 --> 1601.19
anything then yeah of course everybody

1599.18 --> 1604.8200000000002
is going to be suspicious it's not even

1601.19 --> 1607.0700000000002
it's in it's suspicious it's it's not a

1604.82 --> 1611.27
direct proof that they've actually done

1607.07 --> 1615.6699999999998
something nefarious but everyone who

1611.27 --> 1618.86
immediately think they did and even the

1615.67 --> 1621.26
authoritarians they will be like yeah it

1618.86 --> 1623.6499999999999
did it was an accident and you can't

1621.26 --> 1626.93
speak up because they're defending

1623.65 --> 1634.94
whatever even whether is a lie or it's

1626.93 --> 1637.88
not there they'll be defending it so it

1634.94 --> 1642.1100000000001
could have been an accident but what I

1637.88 --> 1647.0
want to know is can I see a forensics

1642.11 --> 1649.78
report please I want to see it also it

1647.0 --> 1652.46
is it is weird I watched some other

1649.78 --> 1655.22
channels talk about it lift the veil had

1652.46 --> 1658.7
some informative piece about it which he

1655.22 --> 1660.68
agreed with me like I love I love his

1658.7 --> 1662.72
attention for detail he made a hangout

1660.68 --> 1667.16
basically saying okay yeah it's been on

1662.72 --> 1669.59
fire before even a long time ago and it

1667.16 --> 1671.3600000000001
was just a roof and they removed a lot

1669.59 --> 1674.3799999999999
of the statues apparently during the

1671.36 --> 1679.3899999999999
maintenance so not everything was

1674.38 --> 1679.39
unspoiled but a lot of it was

1679.44 --> 1687.0
lucky or no yeah it is everything about

1683.7 --> 1689.5800000000002
it is so insanely suspicious but there's

1687.0 --> 1692.04
no direct proof you'd have to see a

1689.58 --> 1694.4399999999998
forensics report how did the fire start

1692.04 --> 1696.12
was there something there that shouldn't

1694.44 --> 1700.05
have been there some kind of gas

1696.12 --> 1704.4899999999998
canister or flare or I don't know

1700.05 --> 1708.98
anything but I don't think we're gonna

1704.49 --> 1711.6
get to know from the government anyway

1708.98 --> 1713.88
but at least the weird thing is that

1711.6 --> 1715.98
apparently the maintenance was very

1713.88 --> 1720.6200000000001
expensive and they have trouble finding

1715.98 --> 1724.35
the money and the one did appear the

1720.62 --> 1727.7399999999998
procurer of the natural dam was getting

1724.35 --> 1731.28
funds together and he was getting there

1727.74 --> 1732.84
it was like a couple of million I don't

1731.28 --> 1735.18
know I don't remember how much it was

1732.84 --> 1738.59
but he didn't really get it together and

1735.18 --> 1741.45
now suddenly with this fire bang a

1738.59 --> 1745.83
quarter of a billion dollars in

1741.45 --> 1749.19
donations like holy [ __ ] couldn't they

1745.83 --> 1751.9199999999998
have done that before why how did and

1749.19 --> 1755.91
again did they do it in a sort of

1751.92 --> 1760.0800000000002
complex nobility level insurance scam

1755.91 --> 1762.39
set up just to make it affordable

1760.08 --> 1764.6999999999998
somehow and they just minimize you know

1762.39 --> 1768.3200000000002
it could be it could be like one of

1764.7 --> 1776.47
these ingenious French nobility tricks a

1768.32 --> 1778.75
tactic just get the funds right

1776.47 --> 1782.02
get enough momentum to how to make it

1778.75 --> 1784.86
happen you know that that's politics

1782.02 --> 1790.27
that's that's like

1784.86 --> 1792.24
medieval politics though but hey it

1790.27 --> 1795.43
could have been that as well

1792.24 --> 1797.41
so yeah no wonder if that will be the

1795.43 --> 1799.63
case that no wonder there's not gonna be

1797.41 --> 1802.0600000000002
an investigation basically although yeah

1799.63 --> 1804.3400000000001
afterwards I'll bet you and it could

1802.06 --> 1806.62
take a decade maybe there probably will

1804.34 --> 1810.07
be an investigation somehow or or

1806.62 --> 1813.1599999999999
everybody's gonna be just happy that the

1810.07 --> 1817.36
thing is restored and nobody cares it

1813.16 --> 1819.3400000000001
all depends but yet as for now the

1817.36 --> 1822.9099999999999
speculation about this thing is gonna go

1819.34 --> 1825.07
wild for a for a while from all angles a

1822.91 --> 1828.3400000000001
little bit Muslims must have did it are

1825.07 --> 1832.6599999999999
the Muslim agenda through the leftist or

1828.34 --> 1834.4299999999998
crazy anti Christians or it was an

1832.66 --> 1836.38
accident really because they've been

1834.43 --> 1838.24
sloppy and the collective which is not

1836.38 --> 1840.63
good for the gun image of the government

1838.24 --> 1844.95
either but it wouldn't be the first time

1840.63 --> 1848.6200000000001
you know or it was a very ingenious

1844.95 --> 1853.5900000000001
financial scam set up to make the

1848.62 --> 1858.1899999999998
finances happen from the secret society

1853.59 --> 1860.74
you know you never know until you

1858.19 --> 1864.28
actually get all the data together so it

1860.74 --> 1867.5
does make me very curious and I want to

1864.28 --> 1869.95
see a forensics report please

1867.5 --> 1872.68
[Music]

1869.95 --> 1875.04
anyway so that is my take on the not

1872.68 --> 1875.04
sure down

1876.74 --> 1879.849
[Music]

1892.67 --> 1900.0
yeah

1894.33 --> 1903.09
ah thank you for the unexpected question

1900.0 --> 1905.94
Hanna Dean what is my view on fluidic

1903.09 --> 1908.6689999999999
space the stars appearing as through as

1905.94 --> 1912.98
though they are underwater caused by

1908.669 --> 1912.98
solo luminescence

1917.16 --> 1923.39
you know some confirmation of water

1922.14 --> 1925.919
would be nice

1923.39 --> 1928.74
it all depends what's up there like if

1925.919 --> 1933.14
there's gonna be water how it's gonna be

1928.74 --> 1940.08
water beyond the barrier is it gonna be

1933.14 --> 1942.8090000000002
some like liquid liquid helium at some

1940.08 --> 1945.72
height that would be stay up there for

1942.809 --> 1948.72
some reason or even just have originally

1945.72 --> 1954.1200000000001
crystallized so I don't know it all

1948.72 --> 1955.83
depends on what's up there I think with

1954.12 --> 1958.2299999999998
all the moisture in the air I don't

1955.83 --> 1961.4399999999998
think there needs to be real liquid

1958.23 --> 1964.169
water out there in order for some solar

1961.44 --> 1968.309
luminescent effect the manifest I think

1964.169 --> 1971.039
it's rather you know it originates in an

1968.309 --> 1973.01
electromagnetic or side effect that

1971.039 --> 1977.37
causes the entire globe of the heavens

1973.01 --> 1980.61
and it's just bizarre and complex how

1977.37 --> 1982.5
that can work something electrical and

1980.61 --> 1987.27
it's probably all within the atmosphere

1982.5 --> 1990.75
maybe the higher atmosphere but it just

1987.27 --> 1994.5
causes this like this damn I glow of

1990.75 --> 1997.559
light as a as a holographic side effects

1994.5 --> 2001.13
basically all of it and - including the

1997.559 --> 2003.08
daylight the yeah

2001.13 --> 2005.45
it's very weird when I say that isn't it

2003.08 --> 2011.96
when I say yeah the daylight all that

2005.45 --> 2015.419
it's holographic and it is supportable

2011.96 --> 2018.229
because yeah look

2015.419 --> 2021.479
just for example you have a mountain

2018.229 --> 2023.8790000000001
that stands out and just flat land all

2021.479 --> 2026.429
over the place and you go to the

2023.879 --> 2030.019
mountain with some one person and

2026.429 --> 2035.519
another person goes we beyond that like

2030.019 --> 2037.679
30 kilometers 23 up and they could see

2035.519 --> 2039.929
they'd let you really have the spot

2037.679 --> 2042.239
where the other person is inside and

2039.929 --> 2045.3890000000001
from the mountain there's a chance that

2042.239 --> 2048.569
even though yeah they could see the

2045.389 --> 2050.22
location without it being concealed at

2048.569 --> 2053.429
the horizon because they were high up

2050.22 --> 2055.1389999999997
enough well if they're both gonna be

2053.429 --> 2059.819
looking at the daylight and how the

2055.139 --> 2061.9190000000003
daylight shines on them and the shadow

2059.819 --> 2064.769
it's gonna cost it's gonna look

2061.919 --> 2067.0099999999998
different if if they could magnify

2064.769 --> 2069.629
enough with any kind of camera or

2067.01 --> 2072.869
telescope to see each other really up

2069.629 --> 2074.909
close but I'll bet you the light is

2072.869 --> 2078.48
gonna be a different angle so imagine

2074.909 --> 2080.909
one person on the ground standing light

2078.48 --> 2083.399
is going in a specific the shadow is in

2080.909 --> 2086.7000000000003
a specific angle and the Sun is over

2083.399 --> 2090.299
there they might see the other person on

2086.7 --> 2092.279
the mountain potentially experiencing

2090.299 --> 2095.97
sort of the same thing

2092.279 --> 2099.119
look the sunlight would look kind of in

2095.97 --> 2101.299
the same angle the shadow if if you

2099.119 --> 2104.6400000000003
could potentially see that okay yes

2101.299 --> 2108.72
anyway but then if you'd go to the

2104.64 --> 2111.299
mountain and the Sun is at a different

2108.72 --> 2113.49
angle over there and the shadow would be

2111.299 --> 2115.799
caused at a different angle I bet you

2113.49 --> 2118.3799999999997
that if that person on the mountain then

2115.799 --> 2122.24
looked at the person at the ground very

2118.38 --> 2127.619
zoomed up that their shadow would not be

2122.24 --> 2130.3489999999997
in the same place when viewed by the man

2127.619 --> 2132.599
on the mountain as by the person

2130.349 --> 2138.589
themselves as they see their own shadow

2132.599 --> 2138.589
yes that is what I suggest is going on

2148.15 --> 2157.01
so yeah that probably blew your mind

2153.79 --> 2161.42
it's this we've already seen this

2157.01 --> 2166.09
demonstrated and even videographers by

2161.42 --> 2169.52
other people and that is with the

2166.09 --> 2172.58
crepuscular rays that they're not

2169.52 --> 2177.02
literally in the locations where one

2172.58 --> 2179.84
person sees them in relation to another

2177.02 --> 2182.42
person at another location they're not

2179.84 --> 2187.1000000000004
there at the same the same cloud to to

2182.42 --> 2191.9900000000002
each viewer and I think that goes in

2187.1 --> 2195.4
general with the sunlight so yeah think

2191.99 --> 2197.4799999999996
about that it's all holographic light

2195.4 --> 2202.01
light from the heavens is all

2197.48 --> 2204.41
holographic so in relation to the

2202.01 --> 2209.09
observer on the position of the earth

2204.41 --> 2211.1299999999997
all of it and in that sense things like

2209.09 --> 2214.55
flashlights are different because they

2211.13 --> 2217.2200000000003
are exactly a light in a certain

2214.55 --> 2220.46
direction in a certain way no matter

2217.22 --> 2223.25
from where you look at it so as

2220.46 --> 2225.44
flashlights and lightbulbs and anything

2223.25 --> 2231.28
we make here is not going to be a

2225.44 --> 2234.94
holographic in nature so yeah

2231.28 --> 2234.94
tell me what you think

2265.059 --> 2271.239
low avoids yeah the Israeli moon landing

2268.39 --> 2275.109
was indeed very hilarious I watched it

2271.239 --> 2277.449
live on jaren's didn't even expect to

2275.109 --> 2281.499
see it life but yeah the accident

2277.449 --> 2284.039
happened as he was live streaming it it

2281.499 --> 2284.0389999999998
was pretty cool

2322.42 --> 2330.14
right well fine each I think you say

2327.589 --> 2332.599
they shouldn't have admitted it well if

2330.14 --> 2335.18
they wouldn't have they'd have another

2332.599 --> 2338.2290000000003
problem and that is that everyone would

2335.18 --> 2340.459
be sitting there staring at screens

2338.229 --> 2342.6189999999997
trying to figure it out make

2340.459 --> 2345.709
calculations and all that [ __ ] in a way

2342.619 --> 2350.359
to hopefully get some signal from this

2345.709 --> 2352.489
thing and they probably or at least BB

2350.359 --> 2354.709
didn't feel like I'm not gonna sit here

2352.489 --> 2358.009
for hours and hours and hours knowing

2354.709 --> 2359.6299999999997
exactly why it was cut off because of

2358.009 --> 2363.579
course he's in the know for that kind of

2359.63 --> 2367.099
[ __ ] of course he is come on

2363.579 --> 2370.759
it wouldn't be so giggly if he wasn't so

2367.099 --> 2373.4
he just said nah let's just get right to

2370.759 --> 2375.349
the point it failed and now let's get

2373.4 --> 2379.989
some get some lunch

2375.349 --> 2379.989
basically coffee break

2390.5 --> 2404.93
now MB machines are not science machines

2398.59 --> 2408.98
are Applied Sciences or as they say in

2404.93 --> 2411.3999999999996
this sector of engineering science is a

2408.98 --> 2411.4
method

2424.3 --> 2431.77
yeah that's pretty tough isn't it my

2426.31 --> 2434.23
view 1875 a lot of people ever since

2431.77 --> 2436.48
genetics has been figured out people

2434.23 --> 2438.64
have been trying to create life out of

2436.48 --> 2445.92
nothing and they've always failed no

2438.64 --> 2445.92
matter the budget no

2446.48 --> 2464.0
is it double sided glass the air inside

2455.089 --> 2469.359
functions as a heat isolator and it's

2464.0 --> 2469.359
very dirty from all the tea should do it

2477.64 --> 2488.56
Wow

2478.97 --> 2492.3199999999997
56 watchin nice so any more questions or

2488.56 --> 2496.7
things or any of you want to get on my

2492.32 --> 2498.92
panel perhaps it's we got 20 more

2496.7 --> 2502.6299999999997
minutes I think I could even throw the

2498.92 --> 2502.63
link out in chat I don't mind

2511.95 --> 2515.5099999999998
at most couples

2518.51 --> 2524.32
I wonder if they are say pressure

2520.34 --> 2527.32
gradient within it it is definitely a

2524.32 --> 2527.32
container

2543.51 --> 2547.71
all right MB what is the natural

2545.82 --> 2552.3500000000004
phenomena observed in a double slit

2547.71 --> 2552.35
experiment light

2554.349 --> 2562.7690000000002
light quantum minima being registered on

2562.979 --> 2566.009
photosensitive material

2571.04 --> 2576.25
that is technically the natural

2573.05 --> 2576.25
phenomena being observed

2584.39 --> 2587.6
[Music]

2599.109 --> 2609.779
oh we're in nature can you observe light

2601.749 --> 2616.359
well where can't you only in caves and

2609.779 --> 2620.069
all that so yeah lies everywhere and if

2616.359 --> 2623.229
you look carefully you'll be you'll be

2620.069 --> 2630.569
bound at some point to find something

2623.229 --> 2630.569
with with two very close proximity slits

2631.829 --> 2638.4100000000003
and you can already try to get an

2635.259 --> 2641.17
example out of that but I don't really

2638.41 --> 2645.3089999999997
care so much about where in nature

2641.17 --> 2649.329
because the natural phenomena is to me

2645.309 --> 2650.3190000000004
like yeah to be fair I am going along

2649.329 --> 2654.579
with that

2650.319 --> 2658.299
it's originated from quantum eraser but

2654.579 --> 2660.88
I just yeah I know I'll go along with it

2658.299 --> 2663.339
to get along but I totally disagree

2660.88 --> 2666.009
because I think and I adamantly think

2663.339 --> 2668.529
hasn't changed always changed my mind in

2666.009 --> 2674.349
this really just entertaining their

2668.529 --> 2675.88
system because I yeah because I don't

2674.349 --> 2680.759
necessarily need to stick to this

2675.88 --> 2686.0190000000002
concept to make a point but in my view

2680.759 --> 2690.219
the natural world nesic natural and

2686.019 --> 2694.089
physical world is not separated natural

2690.219 --> 2699.2690000000002
its natural and physical so that means

2694.089 --> 2702.91
anything that is not theoretical or

2699.269 --> 2705.4199999999996
anything anything that's purely

2702.91 --> 2708.779
theoretical or something that cannot be

2705.42 --> 2713.279
sensory detected in any way is excluded

2708.779 --> 2719.729
so physical and natural means anything

2713.279 --> 2719.729
material tangible or detectable

2723.25 --> 2728.26
but that yeah you have to be careful

2726.369 --> 2730.359
than with any physicality assumption

2728.26 --> 2733.0
bias of course because if you're going

2730.359 --> 2735.67
to add presuppositions of certain

2733.0 --> 2741.48
natures onto that then you're gonna go

2735.67 --> 2741.48
in a on a dwelling route with that

2749.68 --> 2753.469
[Music]

2755.52 --> 2764.369
well Daniel the thing is not even

2759.9 --> 2769.4900000000002
necessarily there is some signs of it

2764.369 --> 2773.6400000000003
but I think there's probably more

2769.49 --> 2779.1
expressions of this like opinions about

2773.64 --> 2781.44
it the problem is there is no unified

2779.1 --> 2783.42
system really there so just a lot of

2781.44 --> 2785.34
people working together and agreeing

2783.42 --> 2787.6800000000003
with certain things but there's also

2785.34 --> 2791.31
differences of opinion up to a certain

2787.68 --> 2794.4199999999996
degree and that makes the body of

2791.31 --> 2797.82
science let's just call it very

2794.42 --> 2801.09
complicated because it's not really all

2797.82 --> 2805.26
unified not as much as we would as it is

2801.09 --> 2807.6800000000003
made to look in the religious assumption

2805.26 --> 2807.6800000000003
of it all

2812.619 --> 2820.609
but in that sense science and the

2817.28 --> 2825.7400000000002
scientific method have been watered down

2820.609 --> 2830.8089999999997
and basically dispersed into nothingness

2825.74 --> 2834.2599999999998
into a myth for centuries or at least a

2830.809 --> 2837.38
century it's been turned into a mockery

2834.26 --> 2840.2000000000003
and there's even there is a wide history

2837.38 --> 2842.7200000000003
of the scientific methods as they say

2840.2 --> 2849.41
and it's basically all different

2842.72 --> 2852.64
philosophical approaches but from what

2849.41 --> 2852.64
I've glanced upon it

2854.79 --> 2861.87
there is no actual Reformation it's all

2858.26 --> 2865.5600000000004
add-ons it's all trying to deal with

2861.87 --> 2870.48
more ethereal things or things that are

2865.56 --> 2872.73
hard to define all that but the actual

2870.48 --> 2875.19
standard has not been changed

2872.73 --> 2877.32
I have not if there was anything like

2875.19 --> 2879.7200000000003
that then we would have been pointed out

2877.32 --> 2882.1400000000003
because that page with the development

2879.72 --> 2884.49
of the scientific method is open and

2882.14 --> 2886.23
there's have been a lot of people

2884.49 --> 2889.2299999999996
looking into that and if they had found

2886.23 --> 2891.93
it that's been not got stuck at all I

2889.23 --> 2894.51
really like how they thought about this

2891.93 --> 2896.5499999999997
specific interpretation and I've got

2894.51 --> 2900.5400000000004
stuck on that and actually dug through

2896.55 --> 2903.9900000000002
it all to find an official alteration to

2900.54 --> 2907.5
the original scientific method like a

2903.99 --> 2910.68
new standard that that information is

2907.5 --> 2913.26
critical to know to progress this entire

2910.68 --> 2916.56
issue but I haven't heard anything about

2913.26 --> 2920.6400000000003
it you know most people just seem to get

2916.56 --> 2923.39
stuck in their own little loops their

2920.64 --> 2923.39
own opinions

2930.78 --> 2937.0
but as far as I've detected or taken

2934.48 --> 2940.9900000000002
notice of there has been no alteration

2937.0 --> 2944.26
to the original scientific method there

2940.99 --> 2947.049
are over time or there have been over

2944.26 --> 2953.92
time many different interpretations as

2947.049 --> 2957.0389999999998
to certain details about it but in

2953.92 --> 2960.339
essence the core of the method has never

2957.039 --> 2965.7700000000004
really been altered or addressed

2960.339 --> 2970.99
properly so yeah it stands until

2965.77 --> 2973.5
somebody proves the contrary to me by

2970.99 --> 2978.2099999999996
showing me a historical official

2973.5 --> 2978.21
alteration of the original method

2986.24 --> 2992.6189999999997
[Music]

2990.01 --> 2995.5
yeah I know Daniel I'm glad you've been

2992.619 --> 3000.75
looking through it yeah you would be

2995.5 --> 3003.6
somebody to do that it's not wrong at

3000.75 --> 3006.72
all so if yeah I don't want to be

3003.6 --> 3008.7
pointed at like look there's a hundred

3006.72 --> 3011.5499999999997
books here the information is there

3008.7 --> 3013.5
somewhere that's really nice but you're

3011.55 --> 3017.94
gonna have to if you want to say I'm

3013.5 --> 3020.79
wrong and it has been changed then you

3017.94 --> 3025.109
have to actually point me to the

3020.79 --> 3031.2
specific point that explains that that

3025.109 --> 3033.72
is the case so right well don't just

3031.2 --> 3037.6499999999996
post it post it with an actual reference

3033.72 --> 3041.97
link and then I'll look into it because

3037.65 --> 3044.33
it's just another story yeah that's not

3041.97 --> 3044.33
gonna help

3044.81 --> 3047.889
[Music]

3059.13 --> 3065.23
[Music]

3061.799 --> 3068.22
good luck with that Daniel can't wait

3065.23 --> 3068.22
for your reports

3124.81 --> 3133.48
oh wow the greatest philosopher of

3128.44 --> 3133.81
science rejected of the classical method

3133.48 --> 3138.16
Oh

3133.81 --> 3142.21
oh my god oh that doesn't sound unbiased

3138.16 --> 3145.6
at all could it be that it's the same

3142.21 --> 3149.76
people that were freaking inserting all

3145.6 --> 3153.6
the globe [ __ ] empirical

3149.76 --> 3158.4900000000002
falsification well see that is just

3153.6 --> 3163.27
that's not a rejection that's [ __ ]

3158.49 --> 3166.72
it's just another it's another method

3163.27 --> 3169.21
it's another approach like can you

3166.72 --> 3171.73
disprove this can you disprove this well

3169.21 --> 3173.9700000000003
you can make things in a way that it

3171.73 --> 3176.26
can't be disproven because the people

3173.97 --> 3179.14
approaching it don't know everything

3176.26 --> 3183.5400000000004
about it and don't have any direct hints

3179.14 --> 3188.89
or even knowledge of how to get that

3183.54 --> 3192.64
insight so it is very subjective to

3188.89 --> 3195.94
super Sneaky [ __ ] to Overlord [ __ ] with

3192.64 --> 3200.31
foreknowledge so not a very reliable

3195.94 --> 3200.31
method to figure out absolute reality

3207.72 --> 3215.2799999999997
and modern science modern science

3212.569 --> 3217.92
anything can be true until you disprove

3215.28 --> 3220.2900000000004
it it all just depends on if people are

3217.92 --> 3222.329
going to actually disprove it or if

3220.29 --> 3224.52
other people care about these people

3222.329 --> 3226.5
that are going to disprove it because if

3224.52 --> 3229.44
it's something is very convenient for

3226.5 --> 3231.45
some political reason yeah everything's

3229.44 --> 3234.03
gonna be alright with that and maybe

3231.45 --> 3236.8689999999997
years later something might be disproven

3234.03 --> 3240.9300000000003
when it's no longer politically relevant

3236.869 --> 3244.2000000000003
or not or they're gonna build more [ __ ]

3240.93 --> 3244.7999999999997
up on that because hey nobody rejected

3244.2 --> 3247.3489999999997
it why not

3244.8 --> 3250.5890000000004
everybody loves space and planets and

3247.349 --> 3252.329
beautiful paintings and why not people
