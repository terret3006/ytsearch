much appreciate it and I will get back

75.56 --> 80.3
to Members Only videos I should have

78.229 --> 82.07
done it this morning I had a great

80.3 --> 87.74
conversation right before the show with

82.07 --> 91.25
a couple of guys at a at the 24/7

87.74 --> 94.22
discord in a special room a really good

91.25 --> 96.83
conversation so yeah I forget to press

94.22 --> 99.2
that record but I should do it as soon

96.83 --> 105.95
as I get anywhere in there somewhere

99.2 --> 112.61
anyway hmm the weather today it's kind

105.95 --> 114.37
of the same as yesterday just lots of

112.61 --> 119.21
clouds

114.37 --> 121.43
very few blue spaces in between bit of

119.21 --> 127.69
rain here and there but it's still kind

121.43 --> 127.69000000000001
of yeah it's not cold so

129.149 --> 133.099
yeah it's still kind of nice I'll see

131.94 --> 135.69
where it goes

133.099 --> 139.31
later in the afternoon but I'm not

135.69 --> 144.2
getting overheated any time soon

139.31 --> 144.2
all right so let's see who is in chat

144.239 --> 153.20000000000002
Elijah Freeman was first Amanda young

147.81 --> 160.97
truth flicks Robin Stanley Salman

153.2 --> 160.97
Maritain at 100 mark market chain

166.88 --> 172.48
I met them all with my son 2070 saluteth

169.97 --> 174.38
all right cool

172.48 --> 186.39999999999998
thanks for stopping by

174.38 --> 186.4
Oh Burma cool hey Jim you have a

189.56 --> 200.99
yeah yeah good to see you all

192.5 --> 207.62
ROG so oh yeah I got Tamara coffee with

200.99 --> 210.76000000000002
me and green tea as usual and feeling a

207.62 --> 210.76
lot better than I did yesterday

211.27 --> 217.61
because I didn't eat after 12:00 I

214.79 --> 225.04
didn't drink after 12:00 so yeah things

217.61 --> 227.239
just worked out a lot better so yeah

225.04 --> 231.79999999999998
let's see where the show is gonna go to

227.239 --> 236.53
the oh I I actually made notes and I

231.8 --> 239.33
bought a just to kind of make me myself

236.53 --> 243.59
stick to it I bought a special notebook

239.33 --> 246.17000000000002
which I'm gonna use to make writings for

243.59 --> 248.93
my book because yeah this generalized

246.17 --> 250.85
note blocks not gonna help a lot want to

248.93 --> 262.88
be able to get the pages out in between

250.85 --> 265.19
and all that but I kept track this time

262.88 --> 267.05
it's just weird being a no chillest but

265.19 --> 271.74
I'm basically just keeping track making

267.05 --> 274.75
notes of what I've seen for a change

271.74 --> 278.29
maybe it's just to make myself get more

274.75 --> 282.46
used to just remaining notes because

278.29 --> 285.97
that way then I have those notes because

282.46 --> 290.08
ideas with me are kind of fleeting it's

285.97 --> 297.3
almost like my ego kindly used that to

290.08 --> 300.21999999999997
keep me in the same spot right yesterday

297.3 --> 305.26
of course Flat Earth debates after the

300.22 --> 309.58000000000004
show and that was interesting

305.26 --> 311.77
yeah like the Sun I got a good part on

309.58 --> 314.53
putting down about the Sun interesting

311.77 --> 317.53
new angle to it like maybe the Sun is

314.53 --> 321.76
not the cause of the daylight maybe the

317.53 --> 325.71999999999997
daylight is the cause of the Sun like an

321.76 --> 327.58
optical side effect of the daylight of

325.72 --> 331.18
looking into the direction from which

327.58 --> 333.52
the daylight comes and now yeah like it

331.18 --> 337.45
kind of sank in ok gravity is not a

333.52 --> 339.72999999999996
force it's an effect it's a secondary

337.45 --> 343.97999999999996
it's the side effect of something else

339.73 --> 349.42
relative density interactions right so

343.98 --> 351.67
ok well maybe the Sun is not because of

349.42 --> 355.69
the light it's just something that is a

351.67 --> 357.85
side effect in effects looking at the

355.69 --> 359.59
daylight and that may count then for all

357.85 --> 363.46000000000004
the heavenly bodies so it's a new

359.59 --> 365.65
approach giving it a mechanism I make

363.46 --> 368.89
some mechanical backdrop structure I

365.65 --> 373.23999999999995
thought it was it was good it gives me

368.89 --> 375.76
more headway - yeah conceptualize this

373.24 --> 378.12
system where the light is not coming

375.76 --> 381.09999999999997
from objects but is actually manifesting

378.12 --> 383.71
so there was a good episode and then

381.1 --> 386.71000000000004
sparse chemo got in there and he first

383.71 --> 389.34999999999997
yeah he went off psychology it was

386.71 --> 391.12
constantly using my example and that it

389.35 --> 393.22
was so great and that the ball should do

391.12 --> 395.25
that too and it's just I don't know he

393.22 --> 399.51000000000005
was pulling things out of context but

395.25 --> 399.51
that's what the Hangout turned into

399.639 --> 408.58
right record it right then oh and

406.21 --> 412.93
Benjamin was there and you know exactly

408.58 --> 417.789
what because I wrote it down yeah I had

412.93 --> 420.28000000000003
David good on and this is a a gardener /

417.789 --> 422.59
farmer homesteader guy obviously because

420.28 --> 425.02
that that's complete situation and what

422.59 --> 427.75
they were talking about this guy

425.02 --> 429.18899999999996
obviously has his own channel but yeah

427.75 --> 431.68
was just good talking more about

429.189 --> 433.65900000000005
gardening and just how it works and what

431.68 --> 436.629
it is like to have goats and stuff and

433.659 --> 437.58
oh yeah Oh Benjamin also revealed this

436.629 --> 442.449
amazing

437.58 --> 444.52
was it the pencil painting of himself

442.449 --> 447.099
with his kids surrounded by goats that

444.52 --> 451.24
thing was epic don't know if anybody

447.099 --> 454.389
picked up on that right so his second

451.24 --> 456.31
hangout after that I kind of stopped

454.389 --> 459.43
taking notes second hangout which was

456.31 --> 461.55
much later it was really putting things

459.43 --> 464.589
together type of hangout he had ideas

461.55 --> 467.11
and I thought it was brilliant it was so

464.589 --> 470.8
good that I actually named my hangout

467.11 --> 474.69
pretty much after him after what came

470.8 --> 481.719
out of that show KO fit 90% oxygen and

474.69 --> 484.509
mask is climate change because yeah he

481.719 --> 486.46
just found somebody that kind of tested

484.509 --> 488.68
the mask with the oxygen thing and it

486.46 --> 491.68
showed like ooh first twenty one without

488.68 --> 497.379
a mask and then goes back to ninety

491.68 --> 503.949
point something and yet co fit 19 maybe

497.379 --> 506.77000000000004
it secretly is based on the result that

503.949 --> 509.979
was going to come out of what was the

506.77 --> 511.75
response which is wearing masks so it's

509.979 --> 514.5989999999999
like hidden in there maybe maybe this is

511.75 --> 519.959
a real thing a real little tinkered

514.599 --> 519.9590000000001
secret 19 percent oxygen

521.89 --> 528.86
right and yeah then that was looped into

526.4 --> 531.4399999999999
or that was connected into the idea okay

528.86 --> 534.38
climate change its SIA - right co2 is

531.44 --> 538.19
the problem with climate change right so

534.38 --> 540.4399999999999
in the mask the Emine of co2 increases

538.19 --> 543.3800000000001
dramatically so there is like an

540.44 --> 551.5400000000001
effectively manmade climate change

543.38 --> 555.61
happening locally within the mask yeah I

551.54 --> 558.56
thought it was it was just mind-blowing

555.61 --> 561.38
yeah Whitten it was measured with the

558.56 --> 564.56
oxygen measuring device you know there's

561.38 --> 567.4
a lot of people doing that nowadays that

564.56 --> 571.42
starts beeping when the oxygen level

567.4 --> 571.42
lowers down to dangerous levels

573.93 --> 577.0799999999999
[Music]

579.32 --> 586.19
right so that was it for the notes after

584.449 --> 593.93
that I pretty much what continued

586.19 --> 596.3000000000001
watching dark basically watching this

593.93 --> 601.7299999999999
that I think it's sort of the last

596.3 --> 603.529
season wait I'm not sure now I'm gonna

601.73 --> 605.4200000000001
double-check but yeah there's like a new

603.529 --> 607.24
layer to the plot unfolding and

605.42 --> 609.139
everything is getting all

607.24 --> 613.55
interdimensional or like time-based

609.139 --> 616.04
interdimensional and yeah I'm at the

613.55 --> 618.769
last season almost done almost three

616.04 --> 622.279
series and I have to say it is it is

618.769 --> 626.18
something else it is very intense I I do

622.279 --> 628.3389999999999
like it even though yeah it is dark it

626.18 --> 630.829
it's it it does a lot of things that

628.339 --> 635.1800000000001
makes you think in ways that that are

630.829 --> 638.0889999999999
rare you never get to actually see that

635.18 --> 641.2399999999999
displayed in any way it usually remains

638.089 --> 644.3000000000001
these things into pure conceptuality so

641.24 --> 648.319
yeah that I think it's a very

644.3 --> 650.899
interesting series and creepy a [ __ ]

648.319 --> 653.11
seriously there's just so much messed-up

650.899 --> 656.11
stuff going on in there it's

653.11 --> 656.11
mind-boggling

663.02 --> 672.13
are you talking about AGM would love to

667.88 --> 672.13
see D video which video camera

678.8 --> 686.14
how was it measured what sorry what

683.14 --> 686.14
exactly

694.78 --> 702.91
I'll write the oxygen right it a machine

700.18 --> 708.78
it's just you know the device with the

702.91 --> 715.06
tube they use it for measuring air

708.78 --> 717.9399999999999
quality I don't know do I have to

715.06 --> 726.3299999999999
completely know all the technicals about

717.94 --> 726.33
it I've seen devices like that before

731.279 --> 735.12
and I'm pretty sure you could just buy

733.17 --> 742.949
them I don't know how expensive they are

735.12 --> 747.23
I have no idea but what's the cost

742.949 --> 750.18
voices are dubbed over well a GM that is

747.23 --> 753.3290000000001
probably something that you're doing I'm

750.18 --> 762.059
watching it as is I'm watching it German

753.329 --> 764.91
with English subtitles you can you can

762.059 --> 766.86
change that you know in in Netflix you

764.91 --> 769.319
can change that you can choose to see

766.86 --> 772.0790000000001
watch it in original German with English

769.319 --> 773.55
subtitles if you want I think it's much

772.079 --> 776.2399999999999
better because there's so much character

773.55 --> 782.7489999999999
with the there's a lot of German

776.24 --> 782.749
characters in it in a good way

793.98 --> 799.65
okay oh by the way thank you Fe news for

797.34 --> 802.77
the $5 super chair donation I'm very

799.65 --> 806.09
much appreciate that all right Christina

802.77 --> 810.74
Christina Graham you're probably right

806.09 --> 819.21
if it was properly sealed yeah

810.74 --> 822.48
do I on am i I have a decent ability to

819.21 --> 825.24
follow German to some extent it's like a

822.48 --> 830.28
third of what is said I literally cannot

825.24 --> 832.26
follow it but I know a lot of that I'm

830.28 --> 834.86
kind of used to it especially not I've

832.26 --> 837.42
watched this entire series pretty much

834.86 --> 847.5500000000001
but I'm watching it with English

837.42 --> 847.55
subtitles you can turn those on right

854.24 --> 863.34
what but yeah I like I I could get

861.0 --> 865.56
around with Germans especially if they

863.34 --> 869.279
had limited understanding of English or

865.56 --> 873.9
something then yeah I'd probably learn

869.279 --> 878.58
more German they learn more English now

873.9 --> 880.56
would work better than Dutch Dutch is

878.58 --> 884.1
probably just really confusing to the

880.56 --> 887.7299999999999
two Germans because there are many

884.1 --> 889.38
similarities but this is structured the

887.73 --> 891.65
way the Grammatik works is just very

889.38 --> 891.65
different

909.79 --> 917.829
yeah seeking star water did I don't know

913.54 --> 920.079
why we would need that people talking

917.829 --> 923.37
about crypto yeah there's a hundred

920.079 --> 923.37
thousand other people doing that

933.83 --> 942.99
basket what no I'm pretty sure that

940.47 --> 946.53
that's not what it is I'm pretty sure

942.99 --> 949.83
the earth is flat so there's no literal

946.53 --> 951.2099999999999
geometrical shape going on but hey

949.83 --> 954.0300000000001
there's something weird about how the

951.21 --> 960.99
land interconnects right yeah take some

954.03 --> 963.39
getting used to but hey if you want to

960.99 --> 965.04
suggest that the earth realm is a flat

963.39 --> 967.02
ball in some way

965.04 --> 970.0799999999999
what do you want to call it the deflated

967.02 --> 972.27
ball whatever that's fine I've suggested

970.08 --> 973.2900000000001
in my very first hangout that it could

972.27 --> 975.59
be a flat ball

973.29 --> 979.1999999999999
it's literally flat but the way the land

975.59 --> 981.48
segments the spaces of the realm would

979.2 --> 985.73
interconnect would be as if it were a

981.48 --> 991.91
ball but it's not through spatial

985.73 --> 991.91
non-linearity looping realm come fine

997.209 --> 1005.43
the pond sweat no you have no proof of

1003.07 --> 1005.4300000000001
ponds

1013.279 --> 1026.449
add you say Tom Parker edge oh so it is

1017.54 --> 1028.9089999999999
a disk then I'm not even sure the about

1026.449 --> 1031.13
the equator guys everybody seems to be

1028.909 --> 1035.15
all set in their minds in how it's all

1031.13 --> 1037.8500000000001
supposed to be fitting and all that when

1035.15 --> 1040.8190000000002
we don't even absolutely know with

1037.85 --> 1042.98
certainty I don't I'm pretty sure that

1040.819 --> 1046.52
most of you don't know whether the

1042.98 --> 1048.98
Equator which is a derived the

1046.52 --> 1052.309
conceptual line based on the heavenly

1048.98 --> 1054.76
light orientation the Sun right if that

1052.309 --> 1057.6499999999999
line on the earth over which that

1054.76 --> 1059.809
celestial body acts in that way right in

1057.65 --> 1062.3300000000002
order for us to orient it and determine

1059.809 --> 1067.549
it is in line whether that line is

1062.33 --> 1070.28
absolutely straight or circle or

1067.549 --> 1074.3899999999999
somewhere in between an arc we don't

1070.28 --> 1077.78
know that yet so that's kind of critical

1074.39 --> 1079.88
in order to establish what even the

1077.78 --> 1083.87
geometrical orientation of the realm is

1079.88 --> 1087.3500000000001
in order to know what is outside out

1083.87 --> 1092.26
there how that orders itself within the

1087.35 --> 1092.26
realm confine we don't know all of this

1094.09 --> 1103.059
so why don't we start at the beginning

1096.799 --> 1103.059
and not at a presupposed models end

1106.09 --> 1115.3999999999999
that's my that's my approach today yeah

1113.9 --> 1117.44
yeah that's I know

1115.4 --> 1120.77
equator is calculated from an apparent

1117.44 --> 1123.2
position but if just all these apparent

1120.77 --> 1127.03
position relations were just recorded

1123.2 --> 1130.49
and put out then we can see what it is

1127.03 --> 1133.07
we can see how this equator line this

1130.49 --> 1136.78
virtual line how it actually spatially

1133.07 --> 1136.78
interconnects with the rest of the realm

1137.26 --> 1143.48
so it doesn't matter whether it is

1139.94 --> 1145.25
derived from a non-physical thing from

1143.48 --> 1149.66
just an angular relation with the

1145.25 --> 1157.58
heavens it is consistent and we need to

1149.66 --> 1162.0500000000002
orientate the realm somehow being done

1157.58 --> 1165.08
by Fe core or really so did they measure

1162.05 --> 1168.8
it out or that they derive it in some

1165.08 --> 1175.6399999999999
way because I'm talking about literal

1168.8 --> 1181.27
measuring of the equator points is there

1175.64 --> 1181.2700000000002
an angle involved for starters a

1181.33 --> 1184.6899999999998
physical angle

1200.86 --> 1211.03
they eat chocolate ain't ya you'll find

1208.87 --> 1222.25
a link okay and I'll scrutinize it for

1211.03 --> 1224.17
sure all right and hey it look guys if

1222.25 --> 1229.27
there's really and I doubt it if there's

1224.17 --> 1232.5700000000002
really definitive proof not just a

1229.27 --> 1236.8
calculated thing that the Equator is a

1232.57 --> 1239.5
like these specific equator points line

1236.8 --> 1242.44
up to be a geometrically literal circle

1239.5 --> 1244.9
a spatially literal circle within the

1242.44 --> 1248.89
confine of the space that they are in

1244.9 --> 1251.98
right that's just the beginning it's not

1248.89 --> 1254.5600000000002
over yet that's only the start out

1251.98 --> 1256.96
orientation okay because hey it could be

1254.56 --> 1261.01
a disc I've never said that that's

1256.96 --> 1263.32
absolutely impossible I just don't think

1261.01 --> 1266.41
it's a literal disc even if it were a

1263.32 --> 1268.6299999999999
disc if the equator would line up as a

1266.41 --> 1270.3700000000001
circle geometrically because that's not

1268.63 --> 1276.25
the end of it because then we're gonna

1270.37 --> 1281.4099999999999
have to triangulate all the space all

1276.25 --> 1285.28
the things within that equator circle

1281.41 --> 1289.95
and see okay does that fit does it

1285.28 --> 1293.35
literally fit is the space sufficient

1289.95 --> 1295.18
within these circle that supposedly

1293.35 --> 1295.6899999999998
geometrically proven circle of the

1295.18 --> 1298.69
Equator

1295.69 --> 1300.4
does it fit spatially literal or does

1298.69 --> 1303.46
there fit a lot more in there than

1300.4 --> 1306.5800000000002
should and how about on the other side

1303.46 --> 1308.29
you know then you're gonna try to

1306.58 --> 1310.1799999999998
connect the circle see what's going on

1308.29 --> 1313.42
and yeah it might turn out that even if

1310.18 --> 1317.6200000000001
the earth is is desk based on the

1313.42 --> 1320.0500000000002
equator orientation that despite it all

1317.62 --> 1324.4599999999998
being literally flat there could be all

1320.05 --> 1328.08
kinds of weird [ __ ] going on very

1324.46 --> 1331.42
seriously like that what if the space

1328.08 --> 1333.22
within the equator is simply more than

1331.42 --> 1336.47
could literally hit

1333.22 --> 1338.69
within the geometric geometrical literal

1336.47 --> 1339.89
ring that has been established right

1338.69 --> 1342.679
that's what we were pretty supposing

1339.89 --> 1344.42
right now what if that happen what do

1342.679 --> 1346.5800000000002
you do then are you still going to say

1344.42 --> 1347.99
no it's a literal disk yeah I know it

1346.58 --> 1349.58
doesn't make any sense because there's

1347.99 --> 1351.35
more in there than can fit but it's

1349.58 --> 1355.52
gonna be in disk because it's flat it

1351.35 --> 1358.9699999999998
has to be cuz space has to be linear and

1355.52 --> 1363.4
literal and this cannot happen Error

1358.97 --> 1363.4
error right that's where I come in

1367.179 --> 1373.94
because yeah I have a lot of hints to

1370.52 --> 1377.1399999999999
this concept like even before I came up

1373.94 --> 1380.15
with the concept of rectangular looping

1377.14 --> 1381.8600000000001
room the first wrong the disk and the

1380.15 --> 1384.38
other disk above it and the other disk

1381.86 --> 1387.85
above it and below it well that is what

1384.38 --> 1391.16
I just explained about the disk oriented

1387.85 --> 1394.04
presuppositional this model right space

1391.16 --> 1398.78
within more than actually literally fits

1394.04 --> 1401.72
yeah I came up with that very very long

1398.78 --> 1404.24
ago but it was like a science fiction

1401.72 --> 1405.3700000000001
concept to me back then just an

1404.24 --> 1408.29
experiment

1405.37 --> 1409.6399999999999
when first considering the earth might

1408.29 --> 1413.6299999999999
not be a globe so I didn't even

1409.64 --> 1416.21
literally believe it they kind of had

1413.63 --> 1420.1100000000001
hung around they're like wow that's

1416.21 --> 1423.53
surreal and then I kind of connected

1420.11 --> 1424.9399999999998
that concept to first figuring out the

1423.53 --> 1425.8999999999999
earth is a disc right but what about

1424.94 --> 1427.78
this

1425.9 --> 1431.63
these maps we're seeing with all this

1427.78 --> 1433.6399999999999
island and the four rivers at the center

1431.63 --> 1436.0700000000002
how how does that make sense and then I

1433.64 --> 1439.6100000000001
started to realize like wait maybe it is

1436.07 --> 1442.309
like a realm within a realm and more

1439.61 --> 1447.9189999999999
realms within and more realms without

1442.309 --> 1449.69
not surrounding it literally or well in

1447.919 --> 1453.94
a way literally surrounding but not

1449.69 --> 1459.559
having more space content in order to

1453.94 --> 1463.19
geometrically fit around it so from that

1459.559 --> 1465.17
orientation presupposition earth being a

1463.19 --> 1468.42
disc based on the

1465.17 --> 1471.96
equator line being a literal geometrical

1468.42 --> 1477.89
ring well could be that they're simply

1471.96 --> 1482.8500000000001
many of these realms virtually consider

1477.89 --> 1485.19
above each other in tiers and below but

1482.85 --> 1487.9199999999998
specially they would all you could all

1485.19 --> 1490.2
go there in a straight line just going

1487.92 --> 1493.5900000000001
north or south and as you go north you

1490.2 --> 1495.42
would enter the new disk realm now the

1493.59 --> 1498.0
weird thing about it is that the only

1495.42 --> 1501.6000000000001
thing that is keeping this from being

1498.0 --> 1507.0
priests opposed to just being a

1501.6 --> 1509.49
rectangular looping realm is that for

1507.0 --> 1512.04
some reason it has been figured out that

1509.49 --> 1514.86
the Equator is a literal geometrical

1512.04 --> 1516.51
circle that's the only way that is kind

1514.86 --> 1522.1399999999999
of getting in the way of that

1516.51 --> 1526.32
the only thing because if you just

1522.14 --> 1528.18
overlook that it's overlooking so it's

1526.32 --> 1530.58
technically going into error territory

1528.18 --> 1534.3600000000001
from that discovery presuppositional

1530.58 --> 1537.74
discovery point on then yeah it's much

1534.36 --> 1542.3999999999999
easier to just imagine a giant strip and

1537.74 --> 1545.13
the earth realm segment being like like

1542.4 --> 1547.1100000000001
a single picture in a movie role right

1545.13 --> 1548.5200000000002
in an old-fashioned movie role just

1547.11 --> 1552.3899999999999
being a segment within there it's much

1548.52 --> 1555.3799999999999
easier to imagine that even though on

1552.39 --> 1557.5800000000002
that segment apparently the equator

1555.38 --> 1562.7700000000002
geometrically connects like a circle

1557.58 --> 1565.62
literally over that realm which is

1562.77 --> 1567.42
absolutely surreal still so the surreal

1565.62 --> 1569.34
element would get in there and it would

1567.42 --> 1576.2
not be able to get out no matter how you

1569.34 --> 1576.1999999999998
try to imagine what the realm is like

1580.38 --> 1585.39
Wow got really on a roll here and this

1583.35 --> 1594.0
have absolutely nothing to do with the

1585.39 --> 1600.7700000000002
title but whatever so yeah there's my

1594.0 --> 1604.2
case for presuppositional mechanics

1600.77 --> 1608.28
concerning what if the flat earth realm

1604.2 --> 1612.3600000000001
would have an equator line that is

1608.28 --> 1614.6299999999999
geometrically literal a circle but would

1612.36 --> 1618.1689999999999
the long-term consequences of this be

1614.63 --> 1621.96
based on the widest range of options

1618.169 --> 1623.76
because hey within all that ideas that I

1621.96 --> 1626.309
put down realm above a realm above a

1623.76 --> 1628.59
realm if there was simply a barrier at

1626.309 --> 1630.9289999999999
the north at some point or at the South

1628.59 --> 1632.6999999999998
yeah you could presuppose all you like

1630.929 --> 1636.8700000000001
about what would be beyond that but you

1632.7 --> 1639.929
can't and that remains a possibility

1636.87 --> 1642.78
even though I've never seen any inkling

1639.929 --> 1648.24
of physical evidence in any way that

1642.78 --> 1650.58
there is a barrier a physical barrier at

1648.24 --> 1652.919
ground level you know up there yeah

1650.58 --> 1656.6399999999999
things have apparently bumped into it

1652.919 --> 1659.73
and great sign that there is more there

1656.64 --> 1663.21
beyond it but as to a touchdown point

1659.73 --> 1663.69
never seen it never seen a single hint

1663.21 --> 1667.65
at it

1663.69 --> 1673.159
not a single hint of it a single hint

1667.65 --> 1673.159
none none whatsoever not a single hint

1674.57 --> 1677.57
right

1681.9 --> 1687.42
yes I've ever seen are the same level of

1684.94 --> 1691.5700000000002
hints I've seen for the molten iron core

1687.42 --> 1695.46
pictures paintings drawings yeah

1691.57 --> 1700.05
seen plenty of that descriptions proof

1695.46 --> 1700.05
zero absolute zero

1702.35 --> 1705.54
[Music]

1713.86 --> 1726.62
yeah yeah and hey in my realm

1721.07 --> 1729.4399999999998
conceptions that include loops in some

1726.62 --> 1733.6899999999998
way which would be absolutely essential

1729.44 --> 1736.8500000000001
as soon as it is established that our

1733.69 --> 1739.94
realm is not spatially linear then loops

1736.85 --> 1742.9699999999998
become an integral necessary part of

1739.94 --> 1744.8300000000002
that it would be impossible if they

1742.97 --> 1746.39
weren't there if that would turn out to

1744.83 --> 1749.6
be the case that space is not entirely

1746.39 --> 1753.14
linear loops are absolutely I said like

1749.6 --> 1755.03
the own it's an it's an antecedent for

1753.14 --> 1758.75
space not being linear that's what I'm

1755.03 --> 1768.1399999999999
saying right now yeah you try and figure

1758.75 --> 1771.62
out why it's kind of complex alright but

1768.14 --> 1774.23
yeah in these in my realm conceptions or

1771.62 --> 1780.08
space is not linear there is no

1774.23 --> 1782.8700000000001
necessity for a dome to surround us to

1780.08 --> 1788.8899999999999
contain whatever is in the realm there's

1782.87 --> 1792.4099999999999
no necessity for that because the realm

1788.89 --> 1795.3400000000001
space would in itself be the container

1792.41 --> 1799.8500000000001
there would only be a limited amount of

1795.34 --> 1804.22
spatial space volume for the air to

1799.85 --> 1808.37
expand into before it bumps into itself

1804.22 --> 1810.95
and that way the equilibrium would be

1808.37 --> 1817.309
formed the container would be itself at

1810.95 --> 1820.46
least laterally added horizontally so ya

1817.309 --> 1822.77
up there must be containment eventually

1820.46 --> 1827.33
but if there's loops then there doesn't

1822.77 --> 1831.9189999999999
need to be any vertical barrier at any

1827.33 --> 1835.1899999999998
point because the spatial limit of the

1831.919 --> 1838.5490000000002
realm and it being looping would be the

1835.19 --> 1842.65
barrier for the gas containment it would

1838.549 --> 1845.9189999999999
effectively be a barrier limited space

1842.65 --> 1850.0300000000002
looping limited space

1845.919 --> 1856.2800000000002
and I've been saying that for years

1850.03 --> 1856.28
[Music]

1871.94 --> 1878.72
right yeah

1875.489 --> 1882.539
good first half of the show absolutely I

1878.72 --> 1884.8790000000001
was very inspired the guys that I had to

1882.539 --> 1887.929
talk with like up until like 10 minutes

1884.879 --> 1887.9289999999999
before the show started

1907.7 --> 1914.9
well tiny Womble look there's a lot

1911.36 --> 1917.33
about the realm that I don't know the

1914.9 --> 1918.71
things that I have come across I do need

1917.33 --> 1922.28
to test them right that is how you

1918.71 --> 1924.44
establish absolute reality by testing it

1922.28 --> 1926.24
all through basically through the spirit

1924.44 --> 1927.95
of science not the scientific method

1926.24 --> 1931.21
necessarily but through the like you

1927.95 --> 1936.25
have to have physical Avenue after have

1931.21 --> 1938.8400000000001
realness physicality to every aspect and

1936.25 --> 1940.79
if these elements are missing they're

1938.84 --> 1943.28
just rumors are just ideas they're just

1940.79 --> 1946.1299999999999
pictures and nobody ever finds proof of

1943.28 --> 1950.66
it then you must accept that it could be

1946.13 --> 1954.47
something else and that's what I'm doing

1950.66 --> 1955.97
I'm putting down what I know at putting

1954.47 --> 1959.78
down what I don't know and then I'm

1955.97 --> 1963.77
building a tree of possibilities based

1959.78 --> 1968.24
on steps of Freeza position and I can go

1963.77 --> 1973.76
in a lot of directions with that leading

1968.24 --> 1976.82
to all kinds of fascinating ideas even

1973.76 --> 1987.98
potential tests to fall to put to try

1976.82 --> 1991.12
and falsify some of the concepts alright

1987.98 --> 1995.09
yeah oh by the way about the masks right

1991.12 --> 1997.52
let me put a little bit of a kind of

1995.09 --> 2002.28
misconception that is slowly leaking in

1997.52 --> 2007.99
with masks okay so yeah masks and

2002.28 --> 2011.94
viruses is ridiculous it really is

2007.99 --> 2014.98
because that's not what there is

2011.94 --> 2019.18
effectiveness to masks in very specific

2014.98 --> 2022.42
situations for example surgeons wear

2019.18 --> 2025.0900000000001
masks dentists that are going to do like

2022.42 --> 2030.64
serious operations absolutely wear masks

2025.09 --> 2034.1499999999999
why it's not because yeah why because

2030.64 --> 2036.73
it's a catcher from the inside

2034.15 --> 2038.8300000000002
catches particles that come up with your

2036.73 --> 2042.32
breath

2038.83 --> 2045.23
right potent including bacteria just

2042.32 --> 2049.399
stuff all right that's what math

2045.23 --> 2051.679
actually do work for that this doesn't

2049.399 --> 2056.98
wear it to protect him from what's

2051.679 --> 2064.9700000000003
coming outside or the surgeon right

2056.98 --> 2068.409
that's what a mask is for these types of

2064.97 --> 2068.4089999999997
masks that's what they're for

2069.159 --> 2075.32
because otherwise you're gonna have to

2071.51 --> 2077.75
wear like well gas mask type setups you

2075.32 --> 2080.27
know you know them the really tight

2077.75 --> 2082.01
things where you it's very hard to

2080.27 --> 2086.54
operate after that point because you

2082.01 --> 2088.3100000000004
don't even have a full vision that's the

2086.54 --> 2089.99
only thing that can really protect you

2088.31 --> 2093.109
from the outside of these micro

2089.99 --> 2095.859
presupposed particles or gases all kinds

2093.109 --> 2101.42
of things right so the entire

2095.859 --> 2105.8289999999997
utilization of the corona mask as it is

2101.42 --> 2108.65
used is completely useless was never

2105.829 --> 2113.4700000000003
designed to have any functionality like

2108.65 --> 2118.1800000000003
that it's one of the more embarrassing

2113.47 --> 2118.18
constant facts about the situation

2129.14 --> 2139.66
yeah but protect him from what protect

2136.46 --> 2139.66
them from what

2153.39 --> 2163.049
the look they why did I say specifically

2158.339 --> 2165.119
during surgery right because that's open

2163.049 --> 2167.43
wounds you're hanging with your head

2165.119 --> 2171.319
over basically an open wound that you're

2167.43 --> 2176.819
working on that's dangerous potentially

2171.319 --> 2177.92
right so are we going out and just out

2176.819 --> 2183.5589999999997
in the open

2177.92 --> 2183.559
doing surgery and people know we're not

2183.619 --> 2192.359
so this is it makes no sense to wear a

2186.96 --> 2196.529
mask because yeah people have skin and

2192.359 --> 2198.95
all that and it it just doesn't make any

2196.529 --> 2198.95
sense

2216.38 --> 2225.87
fe d you mean Flat Earth debate probably

2221.22 --> 2229.2799999999997
not you know a big bar from maybe going

2225.87 --> 2229.2799999999997
to conventions or something

2236.94 --> 2243.69
I don't worry he have I don't wear masks

2239.94 --> 2245.52
I hate those things like there was in

2243.69 --> 2247.98
the gothic scene even sort of like a

2245.52 --> 2250.8
thing with masks though it was more

2247.98 --> 2255.35
cyberpunk --is-- based and like no I

2250.8 --> 2255.3500000000004
don't wear a freaking mask

2259.51 --> 2262.53
was never my thing

2265.4 --> 2271.4
and every person even in the scene that

2268.19 --> 2276.85
were wearing masks they were all

2271.4 --> 2276.85
miserable Oliver

2280.799 --> 2285.94
there's something that really took

2283.18 --> 2289.5389999999998
notice of compared to just other types

2285.94 --> 2292.359
Goths and all that so yeah but anyway

2289.539 --> 2296.079
that's like 20 years ago or something

2292.359 --> 2299.23
I don't even know what it looks like now

2296.079 --> 2305.799
I don't think there's any more Cyrus not

2299.23 --> 2309.029
like that anyway I think most of them

2305.799 --> 2319.18
just turned into a she AWS or something

2309.029 --> 2321.94
anyway so no scientific experiments to

2319.18 --> 2326.8289999999997
back up what claims Flat Earth data are

2321.94 --> 2330.069
you are you are you trying to prod which

2326.829 --> 2332.819
claims exactly in the Flat Earth debates

2330.069 --> 2332.819
are we talking about

2348.369 --> 2356.71
well I cab it does it does bear on you

2353.249 --> 2358.359
it doesn't literally directly hurt you

2356.71 --> 2361.989
but it just decreases the amount of

2358.359 --> 2368.529
oxygen you take in for that period of

2361.989 --> 2372.66
time and that stacks over time it's not

2368.529 --> 2372.66
a healthy condition to be like that

2374.999 --> 2384.729
it is gonna burden your immune system

2378.43 --> 2388.839
overtime right well being uncomfortable

2384.729 --> 2394.8289999999997
causes stress stress is a proven cause

2388.839 --> 2394.8289999999997
for disease so there you go we have done

2401.64 --> 2404.8199999999997

timeout for that you don't [ __ ] tell

2444.8 --> 2452.4700000000003
me to deal with the stress then of

2448.06 --> 2452.47
wearing a mask I'm not gonna wear a mask

2455.95 --> 2481.0989999999997
there's no reason to do it unless you're

2460.43 --> 2484.4199999999996
going to perform surgery what are you

2481.099 --> 2484.42
talking about flatter data

2487.27 --> 2490.92
for help what

2514.49 --> 2520.1299999999997
well Christina Graham yes continuously

2517.82 --> 2522.4700000000003
wearing masks each day over a year's

2520.13 --> 2525.92
time would definitely cause cells in the

2522.47 --> 2531.02
body to die due to long-term oxygen

2525.92 --> 2535.359
deprivation so your body would start to

2531.02 --> 2539.21
get problems properly regenerating and

2535.359 --> 2541.7
functioning in general you would get in

2539.21 --> 2544.7
a sloth type situation and your meta

2541.7 --> 2546.68
metabolism would adapt to that so there

2544.7 --> 2549.95
could be all kinds of health problems

2546.68 --> 2552.97
that'll slip in and then at the end of

2549.95 --> 2552.97
the year they're going to be bad

2573.37 --> 2581.87
hmm hey a minute you working your ass

2581.33 --> 2585.67
off

2581.87 --> 2585.67
I hope not wearing a mask right

2607.68 --> 2615.06
all right here see you tomorrow thanks

2612.03 --> 2618.17
for being part of the chat haha good

2615.06 --> 2618.17
Amanda young good to hear

2618.72 --> 2621.8599999999997
[Music]

2638.53 --> 2643.1800000000003
you couldn't get a haircut today

2640.77 --> 2649.33
yesterday because you had an didn't wear

2643.18 --> 2651.7
a mask that that's stupid like how are

2649.33 --> 2654.369
you gonna you need to see how it looks

2651.7 --> 2657.0989999999997
right like why would you get a haircut

2654.369 --> 2661.5
wearing a mask then you don't even know

2657.099 --> 2661.5
how it really looks ridiculous

2661.71 --> 2667.349
this it's a [ __ ]

2671.29 --> 2677.86
like it would be one thing if like the

2674.01 --> 2679.36
the the barber would have to wear a mask

2677.86 --> 2683.77
you know that's that would be annoying

2679.36 --> 2686.76
but yeah that would make a little bit

2683.77 --> 2690.43
more sense it wouldn't be good for them

2686.76 --> 2692.71
but yeah you're working on modeling hair

2690.43 --> 2696.93
on somebody then you need to be able to

2692.71 --> 2696.93
see their face properly this is absurd

2715.27 --> 2718.389
[Music]

2729.96 --> 2736.23
oh nice urban Stanley

2733.04 --> 2736.23
[Music]

2739.7 --> 2748.1899999999996
yeah I don't really get haircuts I kind

2743.72 --> 2753.4599999999996
of cut the breaking points myself every

2748.19 --> 2753.46
now and then but that's about it

2764.63 --> 2768.31
like split ends yes

2775.81 --> 2780.099
personal services are going underground

2780.52 --> 2785.75
it's funny in a way because if you think

2785.0 --> 2788.93
about it

2785.75 --> 2793.7
I remember that especially in the United

2788.93 --> 2796.25
States like up until like 20 years ago

2793.7 --> 2799.0699999999997
at least probably still to this day

2796.25 --> 2800.75
there's this whole thing about like this

2799.07 --> 2803.69
has nothing directly to do with this but

2800.75 --> 2806.59
hiring illegal immigrants to do like

2803.69 --> 2808.9
basic chores really cheaply and stuff

2806.59 --> 2814.67
right and there's issue with that and

2808.9 --> 2816.77
moolah politics forever but now yeah

2814.67 --> 2819.44
with the with the mass situation it's

2816.77 --> 2825.22
almost like yeah we have to do it like

2819.44 --> 2829.2200000000003
that like you become the the mosque

2825.22 --> 2830.8399999999997
outcasts and you try to operate like an

2829.22 --> 2833.359
illegal immigrant even though you are a

2830.84 --> 2835.599
citizen probably you just do it

2833.359 --> 2838.13
underground without the stupid mask

2835.599 --> 2840.34
yeah that's logical that that would

2838.13 --> 2840.34
happen

2850.66 --> 2854.6499999999996
and it's yeah it's inevitably also

2853.18 --> 2859.33
probably gonna lead to a lot of tax

2854.65 --> 2861.9100000000003
evasion because yeah if you're not doing

2859.33 --> 2863.5299999999997
it legally according to the stupid rules

2861.91 --> 2865.87
that makes no sense then you're not

2863.53 --> 2869.65
gonna report on your in earnings doing

2865.87 --> 2874.1099999999997
it really right maybe I'm wrong I don't

2869.65 --> 2874.11
know but it's a crazy situation

2883.17 --> 2888.04
bartering

2885.31 --> 2892.81
wait a trading services sure that's

2888.04 --> 2895.21
perfectly legal it's like a hairdresser

2892.81 --> 2896.74
and a nail saloon person saying okay

2895.21 --> 2897.19
I'll do your hair okay I'll do your

2896.74 --> 2901.0499999999997
nails

2897.19 --> 2901.05
yeah that's perfectly legal

2940.04 --> 2943.82
what are you talking about he happy

2941.84 --> 2946.82
we're not making it look more bad than

2943.82 --> 2948.71
it is we're making we're just trying to

2946.82 --> 2951.8300000000004
point out exactly what it really is

2948.71 --> 2957.92
instead of being default apologists for

2951.83 --> 2960.92
all this nonsense what I just shared

2957.92 --> 2962.54
about the masks being kind of useful in

2960.92 --> 2965.9
surgery and how that works and why

2962.54 --> 2970.73
they've always been used right that's

2965.9 --> 2973.4300000000003
real that's not making it look more bad

2970.73 --> 2975.82
than it is it's making it look exactly

2973.43 --> 2975.8199999999997
what it is

2982.44 --> 2986.5190000000002
[Music]

2995.39 --> 2998.5499999999997
[Music]

2999.42 --> 3003.619
all right well yeah but that's gas masks

3002.03 --> 3009.349
that's something that's different

3003.619 --> 3014.02
situation as I said a gas masks are very

3009.349 --> 3014.02
different from these mouth masks things

3027.619 --> 3036.1400000000003
friend is going to gym with a trainer

3030.3 --> 3042.75
can because it's physical therapy hehe

3036.14 --> 3045.0899999999997
brilliant right well Robert Stanley in

3042.75 --> 3046.68
the Netherlands here we're well I only

3045.09 --> 3048.4500000000003
picked up on this because I just

3046.68 --> 3050.2799999999997
happened to watch the news when it was

3048.45 --> 3053.81
kind of announced that they have opened

3050.28 --> 3056.4900000000002
it all up here again like sports and

3053.81 --> 3061.5
training centers and all that it has

3056.49 --> 3063.0
opened up and they're getting really

3061.5 --> 3064.77
enthusiastic about it too

3063.0 --> 3066.21
well they should be it's like all these

3064.77 --> 3068.0099999999998
supporters have just been waiting like

3066.21 --> 3071.82
when the hell are we finally gonna be

3068.01 --> 3075.65
able to do our thing again so it has

3071.82 --> 3075.65
been open up here it's yeah

3082.51 --> 3087.4900000000002
I was in gym pendous tennis court and

3084.73 --> 3092.28
they all said hi but they are a bunch of

3087.49 --> 3092.2799999999997
globe tarts yeah okay what else is new

3107.13 --> 3109.849
mm-hm

3110.39 --> 3113.98
all right your Sanford

3115.619 --> 3121.619
yeah Auto painters they definitely need

3118.17 --> 3125.94
masks and if they're doing it right then

3121.619 --> 3128.6400000000003
the entire suit with it because it's

3125.94 --> 3132.049
very toxic the gases that are released

3128.64 --> 3132.049
with that paint and all that

3159.39 --> 3164.7
the mold is very dangerous what do you

3161.52 --> 3170.0
mean you mean molds in the mask here

3164.7 --> 3170.0
that could happen that's messed up

3180.66 --> 3185.49
masked protect them from paint fumes but

3183.45 --> 3191.0299999999997
all the headache from lack of oxygen

3185.49 --> 3193.589
while George Sanford look technically

3191.03 --> 3196.8900000000003
there could be something done about that

3193.589 --> 3200.46
it's just not it's a bit of a hassle

3196.89 --> 3203.46
well what you could do is simply have a

3200.46 --> 3206.13
very small oxygen tank as part of the

3203.46 --> 3209.2400000000002
kit I don't know

3206.13 --> 3217.289
hanging on your belt or whatever to add

3209.24 --> 3221.4599999999996
to the mask to have a oxygen feed you

3217.289 --> 3223.289
know or hey you could even go all full

3221.46 --> 3227.819
scuba diving but yeah those tanks are

3223.289 --> 3230.25
freakin heavy but yeah it can you can

3227.819 --> 3233.299
just add a little like oxygen to it to

3230.25 --> 3233.299
kind of counteract it

3240.73 --> 3247.47
can't afford oxygen tanks they're not

3244.69 --> 3247.4700000000003
that expensive

3252.72 --> 3259.74
and it would be a one-time purchase

3256.66 --> 3264.66
anyway or maybe

3259.74 --> 3264.66
exchange them to refill and all that

3271.05 --> 3275.77
but it would be best to have a really

3273.55 --> 3278.02
small oxygen tank so you can just add a

3275.77 --> 3284.2
little oxygen for I don't know a period

3278.02 --> 3289.24
of time maybe refill it with the bigger

3284.2 --> 3291.6
tank I don't know I'm just spitballing

3289.24 --> 3291.6
here

3292.83 --> 3297.34
[Music]

3302.57 --> 3307.79
[Music]

3305.38 --> 3313.78
for how long you can work with

3307.79 --> 3316.34
mold-infested artifacts hmm all right it

3313.78 --> 3319.3100000000004
could be well there are some really

3316.34 --> 3325.2200000000003
dangerous molds but those molds are

3319.31 --> 3328.58
typically the molds that ate the molds

3325.22 --> 3333.14
that ate the mold and those are messed

3328.58 --> 3338.48
up like certain types of black mold and

3333.14 --> 3343.19
all that they become more toxic with

3338.48 --> 3345.98
every generation as it were like first

3343.19 --> 3347.9900000000002
you get food gets moldy and then if you

3345.98 --> 3350.3
leave it long enough then there's very

3347.99 --> 3351.95
likely another mold gonna grow on top of

3350.3 --> 3354.4700000000003
that yeah it's all pretty disgusting and

3351.95 --> 3358.1899999999996
that one's gonna be a lot more toxic and

3354.47 --> 3360.9199999999996
then if that just keeps on going then

3358.19 --> 3362.75
perhaps yeah if I'm lucky or something

3360.92 --> 3365.6
it might get in contact with another

3362.75 --> 3368.48
model that ate all that can actually eat

3365.6 --> 3371.0299999999997
all that but problem is every generation

3368.48 --> 3373.4
like every fungus creates certain types

3371.03 --> 3376.01
of toxins from the process well those

3373.4 --> 3380.54
taxes are going to also be consumed by

3376.01 --> 3383.63
the new layer of mold so it becomes even

3380.54 --> 3385.85
more toxic see that's how that works

3383.63 --> 3388.37
and I can imagine that with very old

3385.85 --> 3392.0899999999997
artifacts yeah they're very old if they

3388.37 --> 3394.0
had mold at some time then the risk is

3392.09 --> 3400.21
higher that there will be very dangerous

3394.0 --> 3400.21
mold involved somehow yeah I can imagine

3400.45 --> 3405.77
something I picked up about molds so

3403.82 --> 3410.69
don't leave your moldy things in your

3405.77 --> 3415.03
refrigerator can actually be really

3410.69 --> 3415.03
dangerous if you wait too long

3438.34 --> 3443.089
all right

3440.67 --> 3444.9
anyway I'm gonna round out the show I

3443.089 --> 3447.869
thought it was pretty good show

3444.9 --> 3451.529
especially the first half I'm gonna

3447.869 --> 3453.839
watch that back just see how if I put

3451.529 --> 3456.18
that down right and I'm making notes of

3453.839 --> 3462.029
these now for myself because I am kind

3456.18 --> 3464.73
of trying to work on a book I'm gonna

3462.029 --> 3471.359
really push this because I do want it

3464.73 --> 3473.91
and at least I got an idea now and it's

3471.359 --> 3476.299
gonna be typically that what I just did

3473.91 --> 3478.0789999999997
on the first half of the show with the

3476.299 --> 3479.849
presuppositional mechanics of the

3478.079 --> 3482.1800000000003
orientation what if did what of that

3479.849 --> 3485.94
that's gonna be a big part of the book

3482.18 --> 3488.339
once it's manifested fully that's what

3485.94 --> 3490.829
its gonna be all about anyway

3488.339 --> 3492.39
