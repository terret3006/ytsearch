195.44 --> 199.44
fed today nathan hasn't said so far but

198.48 --> 201.599
he hasn't

199.44 --> 201.599
yet

201.68 --> 207.04000000000002
he hasn't told us that he wouldn't do a

203.76 --> 211.07999999999998
show so yeah we'll just have to see

207.04 --> 211.07999999999998
what's gonna happen this friday

212.799 --> 219.68
right but i'm gonna do

215.36 --> 219.68
a show one and a half hour at least

220.72 --> 226.44
i'll just see what happens

223.44 --> 226.44
right

227.68 --> 234.239
so yeah me yesterday

230.799 --> 235.76000000000002
i did a whole bunch of sleeping

234.239 --> 238.08
i think

235.76 --> 241.84
and all together yesterday

238.08 --> 241.84
and this night i slept like

242.48 --> 247.28
14 hours

244.799 --> 247.28
serious

247.439 --> 252.879
because yesterday after i rounded out

249.439 --> 257.12
the show i literally just

252.879 --> 259.84
went to sleep back again i just

257.12 --> 262.24
i just really felt like it i just needed

259.84 --> 264.63899999999995
extra sleep i guess

262.24 --> 266.96000000000004
didn't even go to bed too late

264.639 --> 270.0
so i slept even more

266.96 --> 272.23999999999995
and then i still got up kind of late so

270.0 --> 276.639
i slept a whole bunch

272.24 --> 276.639
but it has done me a whole bunch of good

278.72 --> 282.84000000000003
i think i really needed that

283.68 --> 289.52
hello goldie mckernan

overall

322.56 --> 326.96
on the internet

324.96 --> 328.63899999999995
because it's just i've been sleeping a

326.96 --> 331.19899999999996
lot

328.639 --> 332.639
i did catch jim bob live though

331.199 --> 335.88

as usual

339.52 --> 341.84
uh

344.72 --> 349.44000000000005

half an hour of owen benjamin's latest

349.44 --> 352.44
stream

354.16 --> 357.91900000000004

356.16 --> 359.91900000000004

400.4 --> 405.67999999999995
laid-back show today

403.84 --> 407.84
also because i don't really have a lot

yeah i don't know what it was

425.36 --> 429.199
well usually like uh

432.08 --> 438.96
i do often have a tendency to kind of

434.8 --> 440.16
like be a little sleepish

438.96 --> 443.28
in the

440.16 --> 445.36
late afternoon early evening

443.28 --> 447.19899999999996
but normally i just kind of go sit

445.36 --> 449.52000000000004
through it when that happened this time

456.08 --> 461.19899999999996
took a long time

458.319 --> 465.40000000000003
wasn't really short

461.199 --> 465.40000000000003
when i woke up it was dark

470.8 --> 476.879

473.68 --> 480.879
that happened a while ago

476.879 --> 483.52000000000004
i mean that yeah jordan maxwell died

480.879 --> 483.52000000000004
years back

489.36 --> 494.8
and yeah he was very interesting

492.96 --> 496.15999999999997
he had a lot of

494.8 --> 498.40000000000003
like

496.16 --> 502.68
space gravel

498.4 --> 502.67999999999995
but he was very interesting

506.96 --> 511.12
did jaron publish something i don't know

513.519 --> 519.36
uh

515.44 --> 519.36
he had a baby truth or show yesterday

519.519 --> 522.719
16 hours ago

524.399 --> 527.68
according to the youtube notifications

526.48 --> 531.399
so

527.68 --> 531.399
i didn't watch it

534.16 --> 536.64
wait what

541.44 --> 546.24
what oh

543.92 --> 549.1999999999999
huh

546.24 --> 552.08
okay

549.2 --> 555.48
he was still alive then i guess that's

552.08 --> 555.48
so weird

568.399 --> 573.839
dude the guy was 80 though

571.36 --> 577.16
like 82.

573.839 --> 577.1600000000001
are you sure

580.0 --> 585.12
huh

581.04 --> 585.12
his wikipedia doesn't say it yet

589.44 --> 594.8800000000001
right this wikipedia says he's in was a

592.399 --> 594.88
gnostic

596.08 --> 599.08
goody

613.92 --> 618.16
huh okay so i guess he was still alive

616.8 --> 620.3199999999999
then i thought it

618.16 --> 624.36
i must have mixed them up

620.32 --> 624.36
but yeah okay

633.839 --> 638.6400000000001
first thing you mentioned yet oh well i

635.76 --> 642.36
must have overlooked that can of bear

638.64 --> 642.36
i haven't seen that

660.959 --> 664.1199999999999
all right

694.48 --> 697.48
okay

706.32 --> 711.519
yeah goldie mckernan i'm gonna have a

708.64 --> 713.92
great day for sure

711.519 --> 716.0
i mean i'm all rested and showered and

713.92 --> 719.5999999999999
all that

716.0 --> 719.6
it's beautiful weather out there

727.12 --> 730.839
hello jess palmer

741.839 --> 749.0790000000001
you're from the west coast i take it

745.36 --> 749.0790000000001
if it's that early

758.72 --> 762.639
very important to put out that positive

760.48 --> 765.839
energy well with me i think it's a bit

762.639 --> 765.839
sleepy energy you know

766.16 --> 770.88
but yeah it does kind of feel like i

768.56 --> 774.2399999999999
just came out of winter sleep

770.88 --> 776.079
because that might be partially true

774.24 --> 778.639
because i slept so much yesterday i'm

776.079 --> 780.4799999999999
just surprised that's even possible

778.639 --> 782.399
so it must have been like a moment

780.48 --> 784.839
because normally i

782.399 --> 788.079
yeah you just don't sleep that long in a

784.839 --> 790.72
row and then keep on going

788.079 --> 792.8
normally you just wake up and then you

790.72 --> 795.6800000000001
really can't go back to sleep well that

792.8 --> 795.68
didn't really happen

799.6 --> 804.32
mountain time all right

802.16 --> 806.48
idaho

804.32 --> 808.8000000000001
idaho

806.48 --> 808.8000000000001
cool

809.12 --> 813.32

833.76 --> 839.16
a flatter sage

835.6 --> 839.16
good to see you

870.8 --> 873.12
man

874.0 --> 878.0
i think all that sleep really did

876.24 --> 880.5600000000001
like an excellent job helping me

878.0 --> 882.8
regenerate jaw issues

880.56 --> 884.88
not just the one spot but just

882.8 --> 886.88
everything

884.88 --> 889.76
because

886.88 --> 892.24
it feels great so i think i really used

889.76 --> 893.519
that sleep for like extra regeneration

892.24 --> 896.16
or something

893.519 --> 896.16
and it worked

896.92 --> 899.9699999999999
[Music]

913.76 --> 916.76
uh

939.36 --> 946.72
right so yeah i'm up for whatever

943.519 --> 949.519
i don't really have much laying

946.72 --> 949.519
on my mind

949.839 --> 953.6800000000001

to that

1037.439 --> 1042.24
but yeah fine

1039.679 --> 1044.48
ooh a girlfriend turned back to baller

1042.24 --> 1044.48
oh

1044.72 --> 1048.28
surprise surprise

1059.919 --> 1064.1200000000001
hey rick back good to see you

1070.96 --> 1075.8400000000001
hearing a lot about vades

1074.32 --> 1077.039
lately yeah

1075.84 --> 1078.8799999999999
no they're just

1077.039 --> 1082.4
announcing that

1078.88 --> 1084.5590000000002
it's just you know

1082.4 --> 1086.5590000000002
i mean at this point they're not even

1084.559 --> 1088.8799999999999
like trying to

1086.559 --> 1090.48
create some kind of logically consistent

1088.88 --> 1093.44
cover story

1090.48 --> 1095.6
for the pandemic situation they're just

1093.44 --> 1097.919
basically giving you

1095.6 --> 1099.28
like a school roster like oh this is

1097.919 --> 1101.2800000000002
gonna happen now

1099.28 --> 1103.84
you know this is gonna happen

1101.28 --> 1105.84
they're not even gonna like give a good

1103.84 --> 1109.84
cover story for it it's just like yeah

1105.84 --> 1109.84
this is what we're doing right now

1112.32 --> 1117.76
right they're basically acting

1115.44 --> 1120.72
like they got away with it

1117.76 --> 1123.12
and they're gaslighting us like if they

1120.72 --> 1125.3600000000001
got away with it they're gaslighting us

1123.12 --> 1128.36
like that

1125.36 --> 1128.36
everyone

1138.0 --> 1143.919
hello classical homeopath it is fake

1141.679 --> 1147.76
not really

1143.919 --> 1151.1200000000001
the condition is very real it's just not

1147.76 --> 1154.8799999999999
caused by a supposed virus

1151.12 --> 1154.8799999999999
that part is complete horseshit

1155.039 --> 1158.24
it's caused

1156.559 --> 1160.96
by

1158.24 --> 1160.96
was it again

1162.84 --> 1166.72
azt

1164.64 --> 1168.7990000000002
that's what it was cost or rate that's

1166.72 --> 1172.559
what caused it originally

1168.799 --> 1175.2
when supposed the aids epidemic happened

1172.559 --> 1178.32
and oh you got hiv oh let me give you

1175.2 --> 1181.76
some azt and then you actually get aids

1178.32 --> 1183.84
and die but you gotta keep using it uh

1181.76 --> 1186.8799999999999
yeah thanks fauci

1183.84 --> 1189.84
right but the condition is real

1186.88 --> 1192.5590000000002
and it's just what happens when you

1189.84 --> 1193.84
like poison yourself to a pretty high

1192.559 --> 1196.8799999999999
degree

1193.84 --> 1199.76
and destroy your

1196.88 --> 1202.5590000000002
immune regeneration system

1199.76 --> 1205.76
right because just an immune system is

1202.559 --> 1207.76
almost a faulty model for default

1205.76 --> 1209.919
because none of it actually works the

1207.76 --> 1213.76
way they say it does

1209.919 --> 1215.2
but yeah there's factors that are there

1213.76 --> 1218.4
in the body

1215.2 --> 1221.4
that are influenced that cause the aids

1218.4 --> 1221.4
condition

1224.08 --> 1230.6399999999999
and yeah it seems like

1227.039 --> 1233.28
the jabs cause it as well

1230.64 --> 1236.0
which is not really surprising

1233.28 --> 1238.96
in an indirect sense it had been

1236.0 --> 1241.039
called out a while ago like oh it it

1238.96 --> 1242.32
will actually destroy your immune system

1241.039 --> 1244.72
right

1242.32 --> 1246.3999999999999
but now they literally tied in the

1244.72 --> 1249.1200000000001
condition

1246.4 --> 1250.88
and just say okay that's aids

1249.12 --> 1253.52
okay

1250.88 --> 1256.0
and then of course through the whole

1253.52 --> 1258.08
medical conspiracy

1256.0 --> 1261.679
modeling they can say oh it's because of

1258.08 --> 1264.6399999999999
the virus it was gene edited and it had

1261.679 --> 1265.679
hiv in it

1264.64 --> 1268.4
right

1265.679 --> 1270.72
so now they can call it h because there

1268.4 --> 1272.96
is an hiv connection with the

1270.72 --> 1274.0
presupposed virus that's what they're

1272.96 --> 1275.6000000000001
doing

1274.0 --> 1277.919
right that's why they are allowing

1275.6 --> 1281.6789999999999
themselves to call it aids because there

1277.919 --> 1287.5590000000002
is a connection within the convention of

1281.679 --> 1287.5590000000002
their medical [ __ ] cover stories huh

1294.08 --> 1296.559
you understand that

1295.679 --> 1298.5590000000002
right

1296.559 --> 1299.76
i mean yeah sure we could call any

1298.559 --> 1302.1589999999999
condition

1299.76 --> 1305.76
that is just like that just say that's

1302.159 --> 1306.96
eight it's a condition but not they

1305.76 --> 1309.76
the

1306.96 --> 1311.8400000000001
medical community

1309.76 --> 1314.4
means free medical community no no they

1311.84 --> 1316.3999999999999
don't just call things aids

1314.4 --> 1320.3200000000002
has to tie in somehow with the

1316.4 --> 1322.799
presupposed hiv virus thingy well since

1320.32 --> 1326.24
it is involved prey supposedly through

1322.799 --> 1328.72
the man made in a lab virus

1326.24 --> 1333.1200000000001
now they can just call it age and be

1328.72 --> 1335.76
logically consistent with their

1333.12 --> 1337.9189999999999
man-made convention

1335.76 --> 1339.52
right that's why they are

1337.919 --> 1342.0
allowing it

1339.52 --> 1344.08
to be called aids right there was no

1342.0 --> 1346.64
such connection then they would probably

1344.08 --> 1349.28
start like censoring people for calling

1346.64 --> 1352.0
it aids serious but since it's been

1349.28 --> 1353.44
officially accepted through the logical

1352.0 --> 1354.559
consistent

1353.44 --> 1357.52
story

1354.559 --> 1360.08
of hiv involvement somehow that's why

1357.52 --> 1361.52
they are just saying oh yeah it's just

1360.08 --> 1365.76
aids

1361.52 --> 1368.96
right that's how it works

1365.76 --> 1368.96
that's how they work

1369.2 --> 1373.2
if you can't connect it to the medical

1371.52 --> 1375.12
story

1373.2 --> 1377.44
then you can't

1375.12 --> 1378.2399999999998
call it such things

1377.44 --> 1380.4
see

1378.24 --> 1382.64
do you understand can i get a

1380.4 --> 1386.2
we understand can i get that from you

1382.64 --> 1386.2
guys in chat

1397.28 --> 1400.28
um

1410.32 --> 1414.1589999999999
good thank you goldie mckerman

1414.4 --> 1418.48
right

1415.36 --> 1419.6399999999999
because if there was no presupposed hiv

1418.48 --> 1423.1200000000001
[Music]

1419.64 --> 1425.44
genetically modified virus

1423.12 --> 1426.4799999999998
right

1425.44 --> 1429.919
right

1426.48 --> 1431.44
a genetically modified virus

1429.919 --> 1434.3200000000002
okay

1431.44 --> 1436.559
right that makes logical sense right

1434.32 --> 1438.2
except that a virus

1436.559 --> 1441.76
is like

1438.2 --> 1443.52
microscopic in comparison to any kind of

1441.76 --> 1446.559
dna related thing

1443.52 --> 1450.1589999999999
right so they genetically modified the

1446.559 --> 1455.12
virus with hiv parts

1450.159 --> 1456.4
whatever that's even supposed to mean

1455.12 --> 1459.279
how do you

1456.4 --> 1462.4
edit a piece of hiv

1459.279 --> 1465.279
virus non-animate substance that's

1462.4 --> 1466.799
presupposed by its own how do you edit

1465.279 --> 1468.64
that in

1466.799 --> 1470.4
with another

1468.64 --> 1473.5200000000002
piece of a virus

1470.4 --> 1474.88
nothing about it makes sense right

1473.52 --> 1476.96
nothing

1474.88 --> 1478.96
the whole story

1476.96 --> 1482.4
is about as dumb

1478.96 --> 1483.679
as heliocentric fabrications it's so

1482.4 --> 1485.76
ridiculous

1483.679 --> 1487.76
the whole thing is completely

1485.76 --> 1490.64
preposterous

1487.76 --> 1494.1589999999999
the whole idea and i've been annoyed by

1490.64 --> 1495.6000000000001
it for like two years a whining oh it's

1494.159 --> 1499.44
made in the lab

1495.6 --> 1502.7199999999998
on earth genetically modifies virus

1499.44 --> 1503.679
it's [ __ ] [ __ ] every time i heard

1502.72 --> 1505.6000000000001
that

1503.679 --> 1508.0800000000002
it's so stupid

1505.6 --> 1509.84
and people blabber it on why i even

1508.08 --> 1512.32
addressed that

1509.84 --> 1513.279
they blabber it on so they got a little

1512.32 --> 1517.039
hook

1513.279 --> 1520.48
a little excuse within their framework

1517.039 --> 1522.8799999999999
to eventually blame china for everything

1520.48 --> 1524.799
that's why

1522.88 --> 1527.8400000000001
that's why

1524.799 --> 1529.76
it's all [ __ ] all of it is complete

1527.84 --> 1531.76
horseshit

1529.76 --> 1533.679
nothing about it is real

1531.76 --> 1539.799
nothing

1533.679 --> 1539.799
it's all made up narrative horse [ __ ]

1550.24 --> 1554.84
yeah oh you want to get rid of aids i

1552.4 --> 1558.0800000000002
got a tip for you stop

1554.84 --> 1560.799
consistently poisoning yourself

1558.08 --> 1563.6789999999999
give your body some time to heal

1560.799 --> 1566.32
maybe go to some fresh

1563.679 --> 1568.88
restoration areas like switzerland and

1566.32 --> 1569.76
high mountains right get enough fresh

1568.88 --> 1572.0800000000002
air

1569.76 --> 1573.44
get good food detox

1572.08 --> 1577.1999999999998
yeah

1573.44 --> 1578.48
bye bye aids it will be gone it will be

1577.2 --> 1580.64
gone

1578.48 --> 1582.559
right you might never fully restore to

1580.64 --> 1585.2
what you were before you attained that

1582.559 --> 1588.48
condition because it is basically the

1585.2 --> 1590.4
damaging temporary damaging of your body

1588.48 --> 1593.279
when it happens

1590.4 --> 1595.279
but yeah you can

1593.279 --> 1598.08
probably

1595.279 --> 1602.0
almost fully restore from it if you do

1598.08 --> 1604.1589999999999
the right things which would not include

1602.0 --> 1607.279
trusting in a bunch of shitty doctors

1604.159 --> 1609.919
that give you poison that you need to

1607.279 --> 1612.24
protect yourself supposedly yeah which

1609.919 --> 1616.3200000000002
is going to keep it in place and make it

1612.24 --> 1616.32
worse and kill you in the end

1631.2 --> 1635.679
that's right magic johnson

1633.36 --> 1637.84
he supposedly had it you thought hey go

1635.679 --> 1638.8400000000001
[ __ ] yourself i'm just gonna take care

1637.84 --> 1641.9189999999999
of it

1638.84 --> 1643.6
myself through old-fashioned

1641.919 --> 1645.6000000000001
grandma's

1643.6 --> 1646.8799999999999
medical stuff

1645.6 --> 1649.6
just

1646.88 --> 1651.1200000000001
just good old-fashioned natural

1649.6 --> 1653.52
home remedy

1651.12 --> 1658.039
yeah and he lived

1653.52 --> 1658.039
just goes to show you know

1672.32 --> 1674.559
what

1674.72 --> 1680.559
moon shadow the moon is not an object

1678.0 --> 1682.559
it doesn't have a shadow and no shadow

1680.559 --> 1684.559
is cast on it

1682.559 --> 1687.2
it just seems like that it's all

1684.559 --> 1689.76
holographic none of it actually exists

1687.2 --> 1691.919
as it appears to us

1689.76 --> 1694.72
in physical space

1691.919 --> 1697.8400000000001
it's all a hologram it's just

1694.72 --> 1700.3990000000001
shadow play it's play it's not actually

1697.84 --> 1702.72
shadow there's not a object obstructing

1700.399 --> 1705.12
another object

1702.72 --> 1707.76
causing shadow play that like that

1705.12 --> 1708.559
that's not happening it just seems like

1707.76 --> 1710.64
that

1708.559 --> 1714.279
it's all holographic

1710.64 --> 1714.279
okay marley bloomfield

1741.52 --> 1744.1589999999999
oh damn

1745.679 --> 1750.48
one of nathan's speakers bloke blew up

1748.0 --> 1753.799
apparently

1750.48 --> 1753.799
that sucks

1763.66 --> 1767.229
[Applause]

1772.559 --> 1776.72
how do i know it's holographic because

1774.48 --> 1779.52
of the complete

1776.72 --> 1782.559
and all-encompassing missing evidence of

1779.52 --> 1782.559
a physical nature

1786.48 --> 1791.32
ah there is gonna be a show awesome

1805.2 --> 1809.8400000000001
all right so yeah normal dave

1811.679 --> 1817.96
i know it's not a very elaborate answer

1813.679 --> 1817.96
but it is technically correct

1822.24 --> 1825.1200000000001
right

1823.12 --> 1827.84
there's no

1825.12 --> 1829.52
evidence of any sort that

1827.84 --> 1831.1999999999998
the celestials

1829.52 --> 1833.9189999999999
let's start out with the moon which is

1831.2 --> 1836.48
pretty supposedly the the closest

1833.919 --> 1838.64
object to earth right

1836.48 --> 1842.3990000000001
there's no sign whatsoever that any of

1838.64 --> 1845.6000000000001
them have actual physical natures

1842.399 --> 1848.559
and then even if they were apparitions

1845.6 --> 1851.039
like a light play that could happen

1848.559 --> 1853.12
potentially in a specific location in

1851.039 --> 1855.279
space well it turns out that it's not

1853.12 --> 1856.799
that either right

1855.279 --> 1859.2
it's not a

1856.799 --> 1861.519
image like a hologram that we could

1859.2 --> 1863.1200000000001
create that's literally appearing in a

1861.519 --> 1865.76
very specific

1863.12 --> 1867.6789999999999
position over earth or something right

1865.76 --> 1870.08
that's not it either because if you

1867.679 --> 1872.0800000000002
approach it it's gone

1870.08 --> 1874.1589999999999
it's gone it's not there it just moves

1872.08 --> 1875.6789999999999
with you it's always at the edge of your

1874.159 --> 1878.48
vision

1875.679 --> 1881.519
well that led me to conclude that it is

1878.48 --> 1883.519
a purely holographic phenomenon

1881.519 --> 1886.24
right it's not even an apparition in a

1883.519 --> 1889.6
specific euclidean point in space it's

1886.24 --> 1892.64
literally a holographic phenomenon a

1889.6 --> 1894.8799999999999
almost like a side effect to viewing

1892.64 --> 1899.44
itself

1894.88 --> 1899.44
it's just always there on the backdrop

1902.159 --> 1905.919
and that's

1903.679 --> 1908.919
how i see the celestials including the

1905.919 --> 1908.919
moon

1922.559 --> 1925.9189999999999
it's a true story what

1927.2 --> 1930.88
i don't think stonehenge is real

1931.12 --> 1934.6399999999999
i mean

1932.24 --> 1938.559
i've heard rumors that it's been moved

1934.64 --> 1940.159
etc etc it's not the original

1938.559 --> 1942.799
stones

1940.159 --> 1945.0390000000002
so whatever stonehenge was

1942.799 --> 1946.32
what we get presented with is basically

1945.039 --> 1949.6
just a

1946.32 --> 1951.36
a stage prop like a movie

1949.6 --> 1953.039
it's not the stones

1951.36 --> 1954.0
because those stones

1953.039 --> 1956.0
are

1954.0 --> 1956.799
like all the stones that of stonehenge

1956.0 --> 1958.24
like

1956.799 --> 1960.6399999999999
situations

1958.24 --> 1963.6
they're all like magnetic stones really

1960.64 --> 1966.7990000000002
heavy

1963.6 --> 1969.12
influential stones

1966.799 --> 1971.12
that could potentially trigger visions

1969.12 --> 1973.5189999999998
directly through the pineal gland if you

1971.12 --> 1976.08
even touch them or move close that kind

1973.519 --> 1979.039
of stuff well it's not that at all it's

1976.08 --> 1983.1999999999998
like they plastered it

1979.039 --> 1983.2
stonehenge we know is completely fake

1983.919 --> 1988.3990000000001
now yeah they probably have the real

1986.32 --> 1990.48
stone somewhere hidden

1988.399 --> 1993.6789999999999
from the real public

1990.48 --> 1997.039
some said that stonehenge is actually

1993.679 --> 1997.8400000000001
underneath the stonehenge

1997.039 --> 2000.1589999999999
that

1997.84 --> 2002.84
they got like a chamber underneath there

2000.159 --> 2006.24
where the real stones are

2002.84 --> 2008.32
sitting it's weird i don't know it's to

2006.24 --> 2011.32
me it's a whole bunch of rumors at this

2008.32 --> 2011.32
point

2024.96 --> 2029.2
consider doing a video of what the moon

2027.519 --> 2030.32
isn't uh

2029.2 --> 2032.0800000000002
that makes

2030.32 --> 2034.72
no

2032.08 --> 2036.559
and besides i've talked about this for

2034.72 --> 2038.799
years

2036.559 --> 2042.32
i don't need to do separate i don't do

2038.799 --> 2045.36
separate videos i don't do specific

2042.32 --> 2048.3199999999997
subject only short videos and don't do

2045.36 --> 2051.2
those i've never i never have

2048.32 --> 2053.76
it's just part of my show if it comes up

2051.2 --> 2056.399
i can give an explanation

2053.76 --> 2061.0
somebody could clip that if they wanted

2056.399 --> 2061.0
to right i'm not stopping you

2061.44 --> 2065.44
right

2062.72 --> 2066.72
trolls do it i can't even stop them

2065.44 --> 2068.0
so

2066.72 --> 2069.52
but

2068.0 --> 2071.28
yeah

2069.52 --> 2073.359
i don't have separate videos i don't

2071.28 --> 2076.159
make separate videos about specific

2073.359 --> 2080.0789999999997
subjects i just don't

2076.159 --> 2080.079
i have a live show and that's what i do

2085.2 --> 2088.2
right

2093.2 --> 2099.68
but if you want i can just i think i did

2096.399 --> 2099.68
just sum it up right

2100.16 --> 2104.3199999999997
i'll prepare for clipping okay

2110.079 --> 2113.119
brian's logic would be good

2111.92 --> 2115.28
maybe

2113.119 --> 2116.6400000000003
he's super technical though it's very

2115.28 --> 2118.32
mathematical

2116.64 --> 2121.359
about everything

2118.32 --> 2124.96
but brian does get it i mean the fed

2121.359 --> 2127.52
crowd does understand my position

2124.96 --> 2131.04
and originally they're like oh you can't

2127.52 --> 2134.0
call it that because of i don't know

2131.04 --> 2136.48
physics standards or whatever

2134.0 --> 2140.4
right but they do get it

2136.48 --> 2141.92
they do understand what i mean with it

2140.4 --> 2144.32
that when i say it it's like yeah it's

2141.92 --> 2148.64
not actually any euclidean point in

2144.32 --> 2148.6400000000003
space even if it is an apparition

2148.88 --> 2152.56
because it's definitely not a physical

2150.72 --> 2154.8799999999997
object because there's no sign of that

2152.56 --> 2154.88
at all

2155.2 --> 2161.2799999999997
right suppose it

2157.76 --> 2164.7200000000003
radio signal rebounds on the moon it's

2161.28 --> 2167.92
complete horseshit

2164.72 --> 2169.839
and seriously anybody that even suggests

2167.92 --> 2171.6800000000003
that you can do that on the internet is

2169.839 --> 2173.52
a straight-faced liar should have their

2171.68 --> 2176.56
face bashed in

2173.52 --> 2180.48
for being a disgusting deceiver

2176.56 --> 2181.68
because it's an absolute lie absolute

2180.48 --> 2185.599
lie

2181.68 --> 2186.48
filthy filthy liars

2185.599 --> 2188.079
say

2186.48 --> 2190.96
you can signal

2188.079 --> 2194.7200000000003
though that they have done that they're

2190.96 --> 2197.76
filthy [ __ ] liars disgusting

2194.72 --> 2200.24
atrocious people

2197.76 --> 2203.0400000000004
because it's a lie that can't happen it

2200.24 --> 2206.0789999999997
has never happened every suggestion of

2203.04 --> 2208.72
moon signal rebounds has been a complete

2206.079 --> 2210.7200000000003
and utter fraud

2208.72 --> 2212.839
utter fraud

2210.72 --> 2217.04
yeah it's not even

2212.839 --> 2219.92
close to providing some sort of a proof

2217.04 --> 2222.32
it's just like oh look at the screen it

2219.92 --> 2224.2400000000002
says there's a moon signal rebounds even

2222.32 --> 2226.48
though there's nothing even varied and

2224.24 --> 2229.359
manipulated there's no proof that even

2226.48 --> 2233.68
the freaking moon is being targeted it's

2229.359 --> 2235.839
all complete and utter fraud

2233.68 --> 2238.72
so fraudulent it's

2235.839 --> 2238.72
mind-blowing

2240.24 --> 2245.359
because the moon is not a physical

2242.64 --> 2247.92
object it's a hologram

2245.359 --> 2250.24
it's a light-based apparition

2247.92 --> 2252.48
that is non-local

2250.24 --> 2254.839
it's not an apparition that is local in

2252.48 --> 2259.76
a euclidean position in

2254.839 --> 2262.72
space it's a holographic phenomenon

2259.76 --> 2265.76
as part of the celestial lights which

2262.72 --> 2267.5989999999997
are all holographic phenomenon none of

2265.76 --> 2269.6800000000003
them are in actual positions in

2267.599 --> 2273.28
euclidean space

2269.68 --> 2276.24
they only relate angularly

2273.28 --> 2278.6400000000003
towards the observer

2276.24 --> 2281.9199999999996
in cross-reference to the position on

2278.64 --> 2285.839
earth and that is it

2281.92 --> 2285.839
that is the only thing

2288.0 --> 2290.8
any evidence of a hologram yeah we see

2290.079 --> 2293.44
it

2290.8 --> 2295.44
it's light there's light happening it's

2293.44 --> 2297.68
there

2295.44 --> 2299.92
we see it that's

2297.68 --> 2302.96
an image of light it's the literal

2299.92 --> 2304.32
meaning of the word

2302.96 --> 2307.119
look it up

2304.32 --> 2310.96
what does hologram mean hollow light

2307.119 --> 2313.04
gram image hologram light based image

2310.96 --> 2315.839
that's what it is

2313.04 --> 2318.079
it's self-evident the light is already

2315.839 --> 2320.88
there

2318.079 --> 2324.7200000000003
yeah it's there we see it

2320.88 --> 2329.28
it's persistently there visually

2324.72 --> 2331.7599999999998
and consistent in the way it appears

2329.28 --> 2333.8390000000004
but you can't approach it there's no

2331.76 --> 2335.8390000000004
perspective applying you don't go

2333.839 --> 2338.4
towards the moon and then it's you see

2335.839 --> 2341.839
it become bigger never there's not a

2338.4 --> 2346.079
singular example of that have ever

2341.839 --> 2348.4
ever recorded ever or even witnessed

2346.079 --> 2351.599
because it's an apparition it only stays

2348.4 --> 2354.96
at the edge of your vision

2351.599 --> 2358.4
it moves apparently with

2354.96 --> 2362.2400000000002
the observer as they move just like all

2358.4 --> 2362.2400000000002
the other celestial lights

2363.2 --> 2368.2
no there is no reflected sunlight idiot

2370.32 --> 2374.96
holograms don't reflect light

2376.4 --> 2382.88
yeah reflecting light require

2380.0 --> 2385.52
physical substance in order to actually

2382.88 --> 2388.48
reflect the light a hologram can't

2385.52 --> 2388.48
reflect light

2389.599 --> 2393.96
it's just gonna go right through it

2400.32 --> 2403.52
very funny youtube

2408.96 --> 2413.359
oh you you like david's white little jew

2411.2 --> 2416.0
trickery suggesting that it is a

2413.359 --> 2418.4
physical object over the earth after all

2416.0 --> 2421.359
yeah i bet you do

2418.4 --> 2423.52
little david weiss's jew tricks

2421.359 --> 2425.7599999999998
it's not by i'm not buying that [ __ ] i

2423.52 --> 2428.24
mean it's cute it's just absolute

2425.76 --> 2430.1600000000003
horseshit

2428.24 --> 2432.64
it's holographic and that's what it is

2430.16 --> 2435.1189999999997
you can't mimic it

2432.64 --> 2439.839
you can't mimic the celestials with

2435.119 --> 2439.839
objects it doesn't work that way

2441.08 --> 2444.3199999999997
[Music]

2446.079 --> 2449.8390000000004
all right kimberly bloomfield

2450.56 --> 2454.48
well i hope you got something out of it

2452.319 --> 2456.88
i mean i've explained this many many

2454.48 --> 2456.88
times

2465.04 --> 2469.7599999999998
david weiss says it's a projection not

2467.359 --> 2471.5989999999997
physical then why does he use physical

2469.76 --> 2472.8
objects to demonstrate what you're

2471.599 --> 2475.119
looking at

2472.8 --> 2476.2400000000002
right that seems a little ridiculous rig

2475.119 --> 2479.119
back

2476.24 --> 2480.4799999999996
he does it anyway why because it's fun

2479.119 --> 2482.96
it's fun

2480.48 --> 2485.44
yeah it does reinforce physicality

2482.96 --> 2488.7200000000003
assumption bias though and it makes the

2485.44 --> 2490.8
observer overlook the dramatic

2488.72 --> 2493.68
differences with the celestials and

2490.8 --> 2495.2000000000003
actual physical objects and light play

2493.68 --> 2498.7999999999997
yeah

2495.2 --> 2500.3999999999996
but hey he likes to do that

2498.8 --> 2502.96
i'm not stopping him

2500.4 --> 2505.119
but i will call him a jew trickster for

2502.96 --> 2505.119
it

2506.64 --> 2509.839
i don't think he cares

2511.76 --> 2516.3190000000004
i agree don't live why not no you can

2513.839 --> 2518.48
listen to jews just

2516.319 --> 2519.2
realize that they're probably tricking

2518.48 --> 2520.8
you

2519.2 --> 2522.3999999999996
it's what they do

2520.8 --> 2524.7200000000003
most jews don't even

2522.4 --> 2526.7200000000003
have a passion to explain anything

2524.72 --> 2528.8799999999997
unless they are tricking somebody with

2526.72 --> 2528.8799999999997
it

2528.96 --> 2534.48
not saying that david is a jew like that

2532.16 --> 2536.3999999999996
but yeah he has it in his blood you know

2534.48 --> 2539.92
it's gonna come up

2536.4 --> 2539.92
you might not even be aware of it

2554.48 --> 2557.92
not david weiss's ace

2558.48 --> 2562.0
he is pretty cool

2560.4 --> 2564.64
but yeah

2562.0 --> 2566.24
he had has been doing some [ __ ]

2564.64 --> 2567.7599999999998
demonstrations that i completely

2566.24 --> 2570.0
disagree with

2567.76 --> 2571.76
or more like the suggestions he pulls

2570.0 --> 2574.0
out of that if it was just like oh look

2571.76 --> 2576.7200000000003
at this the sun operation oh it grows

2574.0 --> 2579.52
smaller at the horizon that's so weird

2576.72 --> 2581.9199999999996
and that was it i'd be like yeah damn

2579.52 --> 2584.64
david that is weird man

2581.92 --> 2587.2000000000003
it's like really surreal isn't it

2584.64 --> 2590.16
what it isn't however

2587.2 --> 2592.8799999999997
is supposed proof that the sun is moving

2590.16 --> 2594.7999999999997
into the distance over the flat earth

2592.88 --> 2597.04
right because if that were the case then

2594.8 --> 2599.599
it's moving off at warp speed it's

2597.04 --> 2601.7599999999998
literally accelerating further and more

2599.599 --> 2603.839
and more as it goes to the horizon

2601.76 --> 2606.7200000000003
because the angular speed

2603.839 --> 2609.52
despite the angular size

2606.72 --> 2611.04
remains consistent

2609.52 --> 2614.72
yeah

2611.04 --> 2616.0
it remains consistent the angular speed

2614.72 --> 2618.16
of the

2616.0 --> 2620.48
arc that it's moving

2618.16 --> 2622.48
past right that is moving with

2620.48 --> 2624.4
that remains the speed of it remains

2622.48 --> 2626.88
consistent so if it's moving into the

2624.4 --> 2628.079
distance that means it moves in warp

2626.88 --> 2630.079
speed

2628.079 --> 2631.8390000000004
it's literally going to warp speed

2630.079 --> 2635.04
faster and faster as it's approaching

2631.839 --> 2638.56
that horizon yeah i'm not buying that

2635.04 --> 2638.56
at all that's ridiculous

2639.76 --> 2646.1600000000003
but he likes to suggest that because i

2643.04 --> 2646.16
don't know he can't help it

2646.56 --> 2651.92
eh

2649.359 --> 2654.16
i guess you could say oh it's just a

2651.92 --> 2657.119
fight because at least it disproves the

2654.16 --> 2659.5989999999997
ball earth cosmology oh yeah yeah that's

2657.119 --> 2661.28
cute everything disproves the ball

2659.599 --> 2662.56
cosmology though

2661.28 --> 2664.7200000000003
you know

2662.56 --> 2667.359
do we have to replace it with another

2664.72 --> 2669.68
false suggestion just to snap people out

2667.359 --> 2669.68
of it

2674.079 --> 2679.6800000000003
i mean i think that the whole disc earth

2676.64 --> 2681.359
is already kind of a stretch

2679.68 --> 2683.5989999999997
like the disc earth model that's so

2681.359 --> 2686.64
popularized yeah i've

2683.599 --> 2690.079
argued that yeah sure it's a groot

2686.64 --> 2691.5989999999997
alternative to snap globers out of their

2690.079 --> 2693.52
model right

2691.599 --> 2695.6800000000003
to give them something to

2693.52 --> 2699.52
hold on to while they get out of that

2695.68 --> 2699.52
delusion of the globe earth model

2699.599 --> 2702.4
but

2701.44 --> 2704.7200000000003
yeah

2702.4 --> 2707.359
that doesn't mean that the flat earth

2704.72 --> 2710.24
disk model is actually

2707.359 --> 2711.7599999999998
literal that it's correct that there's

2710.24 --> 2712.7999999999997
no proof for that at all there's

2711.76 --> 2715.0400000000004
actually

2712.8 --> 2718.319
signs that it isn't

2715.04 --> 2720.24
because like logical consistency right

2718.319 --> 2722.56
does the space

2720.24 --> 2726.0789999999997
at the center of that disc model

2722.56 --> 2728.319
actually fit is it the scale

2726.079 --> 2731.28
how about the space at the outside edge

2728.319 --> 2733.2799999999997
of that disc is that the scale

2731.28 --> 2734.5600000000004
yeah i don't think anything about that

2733.28 --> 2736.5600000000004
is to scale

2734.56 --> 2739.44
just like the maps right just like the

2736.56 --> 2741.2799999999997
disk map is a projection that's not the

2739.44 --> 2743.68
scale

2741.28 --> 2746.4
so why would you think that a model

2743.68 --> 2747.52
based on that sort of projection is

2746.4 --> 2750.0
literal

2747.52 --> 2751.44
is the literal terrain

2750.0 --> 2752.48
you know

2751.44 --> 2754.16
it isn't

2752.48 --> 2756.8
but hey it's a good

2754.16 --> 2759.1189999999997
imagination assist to step out of the

2756.8 --> 2761.92
globe model and that's why i think yeah

2759.119 --> 2763.92
sure go advent

2761.92 --> 2766.8
sun and moon app and all that sun and

2763.92 --> 2769.92
moon zodiac app yeah cool why not it's

2766.8 --> 2769.92
not literal though

2772.64 --> 2775.52
one thing we do know is that it's not a

2774.56 --> 2780.0789999999997
sphere

2775.52 --> 2780.079
well not a literal sphere anyway i mean

2783.359 --> 2788.0
if

2784.64 --> 2789.04
space isn't entirely linear as i think

2788.0 --> 2790.319
it isn't

2789.04 --> 2795.44
right

2790.319 --> 2795.44
then maybe the way that flat earth

2795.599 --> 2802.8
terrain interconnects with itself

2799.68 --> 2806.319
well maybe that is a sphere it's just

2802.8 --> 2809.2000000000003
not a literal sphere

2806.319 --> 2811.68
but it might be like a flat sphere which

2809.2 --> 2814.24
is really freaky

2811.68 --> 2816.48
and like god telling you yeah go [ __ ]

2814.24 --> 2818.16
yourself you want to understand things

2816.48 --> 2820.48
oh

2818.16 --> 2822.72
oh here's your freaking flat sphere you

2820.48 --> 2823.76
stupid humans you think you think you're

2822.72 --> 2826.24
smart

2823.76 --> 2828.2400000000002
huh well there you go you're living on a

2826.24 --> 2832.24
flat sphere now what are you gonna do

2828.24 --> 2832.24
huh what are you gonna do with that info

2832.64 --> 2835.2
so yeah

2835.68 --> 2840.5589999999997
i kind of really do think that i think

2837.76 --> 2843.76
that god

2840.559 --> 2846.079
plays heavier and heavier tricks

2843.76 --> 2847.44
the better your inside gets he gets

2846.079 --> 2848.7200000000003
pretty

2847.44 --> 2851.119
devilish

2848.72 --> 2853.1189999999997
right well i think that it's basic i

2851.119 --> 2854.1600000000003
think that the devil is

2853.119 --> 2856.559
god

2854.16 --> 2859.68
not that there's exclusively god i think

2856.559 --> 2863.92
that just there's god

2859.68 --> 2866.0789999999997
the ultimate arbiter of information

2863.92 --> 2868.88
designer of the rules builder of the

2866.079 --> 2872.079
akashic library

2868.88 --> 2873.44
he will need a devil just to deal with

2872.079 --> 2875.44
humans

2873.44 --> 2878.2400000000002
that's how i see it

2875.44 --> 2881.2000000000003
like he didn't have a choice

2878.24 --> 2883.9199999999996
we didn't leave him a choice by our very

2881.2 --> 2885.7599999999998
nature that which he created by the way

2883.92 --> 2888.559
so i think that the devil

2885.76 --> 2891.92
is just basically

2888.559 --> 2894.8
god's servant or another face of him it

2891.92 --> 2895.92
doesn't really matter

2894.8 --> 2897.599
because

2895.92 --> 2900.0
whatever is

2897.599 --> 2902.48
god is in control because he has to be

2900.0 --> 2904.72
because existence could not be any other

2902.48 --> 2904.72
way

2907.44 --> 2909.76
anyway

2910.88 --> 2914.48
how does anyone know you are not in

2912.4 --> 2916.8
cytosphere because there's no curvature

2914.48 --> 2918.64
george sanford just like how we know

2916.8 --> 2920.96
it's we're not standing on a ball

2918.64 --> 2922.64
because there's no curvature

2920.96 --> 2925.2
yeah if we were standing on the inside

2922.64 --> 2927.7599999999998
of a sphere you would be able

2925.2 --> 2930.3999999999996
to use a telescope

2927.76 --> 2932.6400000000003
and then look at the other side of the

2930.4 --> 2935.599
world

2932.64 --> 2937.2799999999997
we can't because it's flat

2935.599 --> 2939.6800000000003
it's not

2937.28 --> 2942.2400000000002
the inside of a sphere it's not on the

2939.68 --> 2946.16
outside of a sphere it's not as it's not

2942.24 --> 2949.1189999999997
a literal geometric sphere

2946.16 --> 2953.04
but the land segments available to us

2949.119 --> 2956.2400000000002
the very nature of the space we stand in

2953.04 --> 2959.359
might be arranged in such a way that it

2956.24 --> 2962.72
all interconnects just like as if it

2959.359 --> 2965.2799999999997
were a sphere which is super confusing

2962.72 --> 2967.359
on purpose

2965.28 --> 2969.92
so that god can tell you oh oh you think

2967.359 --> 2972.16
you know everything but go [ __ ] yourself

2969.92 --> 2974.88
how about a little i'll bite a little

2972.16 --> 2977.04
mind [ __ ] there mr smarty pants yo you

2974.88 --> 2979.04
thought you were smart oh why did you

2977.04 --> 2981.68
deal with the flat sphere why did you

2979.04 --> 2984.0
explain that to the people huh why don't

2981.68 --> 2986.319
you explain a flat sphere to them see

2984.0 --> 2987.68
how they deal with that mr smartypants

2986.319 --> 2991.5589999999997
know it all

2987.68 --> 2991.5589999999997
yeah that's what i think

3000.0 --> 3003.68
concave earth

3001.599 --> 3006.6400000000003
died

3003.68 --> 3010.0
it never really lived

3006.64 --> 3010.0
it was always a stillbirth

3011.68 --> 3017.2799999999997
i mean it's like any little kid could

3015.2 --> 3020.5589999999997
immediately figure out how it's not

3017.28 --> 3022.88
concave immediately right through how i

3020.559 --> 3024.7200000000003
described it it's like oh so we're on

3022.88 --> 3028.2400000000002
the inside of a sphere eh

3024.72 --> 3030.48
okay let me get my telescope

3028.24 --> 3034.5589999999997
let's look over there

3030.48 --> 3035.839
oh i am not looking at the side

3034.559 --> 3039.76
of

3035.839 --> 3041.359
an of america right when i look like oh

3039.76 --> 3043.3590000000004
i'm gonna look that way with my

3041.359 --> 3045.7599999999998
telescope

3043.359 --> 3048.0789999999997
and look far enough right zoom in far

3045.76 --> 3050.3190000000004
enough and then oh oh look i'm looking

3048.079 --> 3052.1600000000003
at the side of

3050.319 --> 3055.2
east america there

3052.16 --> 3058.319
ah yeah yeah that's what would happen

3055.2 --> 3061.2799999999997
if it was actually literally concave

3058.319 --> 3064.24
right and any little kid can figure that

3061.28 --> 3065.3590000000004
out immediately immediately that's not

3064.24 --> 3068.8799999999997
even like

3065.359 --> 3070.319
something that's naturally covered up

3068.88 --> 3073.04
like

3070.319 --> 3076.8
for our conscious insight they

3073.04 --> 3080.52
immediately figure that out immediately

3076.8 --> 3080.52
that that's just [ __ ]

3088.559 --> 3092.7200000000003
thinking nasa cgi in videos is why it's

3091.04 --> 3095.119
difficult to accept the flat earth no

3092.72 --> 3098.0
it's not

3095.119 --> 3100.4
i'm sorry but you're wrong

3098.0 --> 3103.359
it's not that

3100.4 --> 3105.04
it's not the the cgi and all that that

3103.359 --> 3108.24
makes it difficult

3105.04 --> 3109.7599999999998
it's the sheer amount

3108.24 --> 3113.1189999999997
of

3109.76 --> 3115.5200000000004
[ __ ] they rolled out to a level

3113.119 --> 3117.2000000000003
where they forced you

3115.52 --> 3119.7599999999998
to basically

3117.2 --> 3121.359
be friends and accept it or be an

3119.76 --> 3124.079
outcast

3121.359 --> 3127.359
and then keep on doing that for your

3124.079 --> 3129.44
entire life right it's the peer pressure

3127.359 --> 3133.2
it's the peer pressure and the lying to

3129.44 --> 3135.92
your face me forcing you to accept it

3133.2 --> 3138.7999999999997
forcing you into stockholm to defend

3135.92 --> 3140.079
those lies because it's all you know

3138.8 --> 3142.0
that's

3140.079 --> 3144.8
what makes flat earth so difficult for

3142.0 --> 3148.079
people because they've been conditioned

3144.8 --> 3149.599
into going along with with the [ __ ]

3148.079 --> 3150.8
for so long

3149.599 --> 3152.6400000000003
and then

3150.8 --> 3154.96
yeah if you snap out of that and then

3152.64 --> 3157.1189999999997
you realize like it's not even like oh

3154.96 --> 3158.4
oh it flat right oh it's not about it's

3157.119 --> 3161.119
not no

3158.4 --> 3163.76
the real pain the real terror comes when

3161.119 --> 3164.96
you realize you live in a world

3163.76 --> 3167.6800000000003
where like

3164.96 --> 3170.16
something like that is lied about for

3167.68 --> 3172.96
such a long time and you realize how

3170.16 --> 3175.839
unbelievably gullible people are and how

3172.96 --> 3180.559
much you can't rely

3175.839 --> 3182.64
on them in ways that's the real real

3180.559 --> 3184.6400000000003
threshold shocker

3182.64 --> 3185.839
that's the thing

3184.64 --> 3188.5589999999997
yeah

3185.839 --> 3190.64
it's the insight and the responsibility

3188.559 --> 3193.52
of what things really are out here

3190.64 --> 3195.839
that's the real burden

3193.52 --> 3198.559
right it's not the visual it's not like

3195.839 --> 3201.839
a preponderance of visuals

3198.559 --> 3204.0
right those are just like toys right

3201.839 --> 3206.24
i mean if you get a lot of toys as a kid

3204.0 --> 3207.68
yeah you get a lot of toys you you have

3206.24 --> 3209.4399999999996
all that

3207.68 --> 3210.96
well eventually you're still gonna get

3209.44 --> 3212.64
bored with them or you're gonna sell

3210.96 --> 3214.64
them or whatever or

3212.64 --> 3215.44
stack them up somewhere

3214.64 --> 3217.92
right

3215.44 --> 3220.16
that's not the issue the issue is who

3217.92 --> 3221.2000000000003
gave you those toys

3220.16 --> 3222.96
right

3221.2 --> 3225.52
i mean if your parents give you a lot of

3222.96 --> 3229.2
toys but you know they're actually

3225.52 --> 3231.52
filthy criminals that hurt people

3229.2 --> 3233.7599999999998
well then you might hang on to those

3231.52 --> 3235.44
toys and like escape in them just like

3233.76 --> 3238.3190000000004
oh think of my toys so i don't have to

3235.44 --> 3240.0
think about how [ __ ] up my parents are

3238.319 --> 3240.96
right

3240.0 --> 3244.559
then

3240.96 --> 3246.64
the confrontation is a big shock

3244.559 --> 3247.8390000000004
because then you have to face how

3246.64 --> 3251.52
terrible

3247.839 --> 3254.24
your parents were right

3251.52 --> 3255.92
that's what they do they lie about

3254.24 --> 3259.04
everything and they make it ridiculous

3255.92 --> 3260.88
they ridicule you within their lives

3259.04 --> 3262.319
and it forces people that don't know

3260.88 --> 3264.6400000000003
what they're dealing with or that are

3262.319 --> 3266.96
afraid to face it

3264.64 --> 3269.52
to just go along accept it and if you've

3266.96 --> 3272.0
done that your entire life then

3269.52 --> 3273.28
becomes extremely difficult to snap out

3272.0 --> 3275.359
of it

3273.28 --> 3278.559
because you've been

3275.359 --> 3279.92
captured by them for a long time

3278.559 --> 3282.3190000000004
you're in a

3279.92 --> 3284.88
spiritual hostage situation potentially

3282.319 --> 3288.5589999999997
your entire life

3284.88 --> 3290.799
and it's monstrously difficult

3288.559 --> 3293.599
the longer you're in that

3290.799 --> 3295.2
to snap out of it it's super painful

3293.599 --> 3296.6400000000003
it's like

3295.2 --> 3299.1189999999997
a painful

3296.64 --> 3301.359
in a way like

3299.119 --> 3303.28
when you're super in love with somebody

3301.359 --> 3305.92
and they break up with you

3303.28 --> 3309.119
people can go insane from that they can

3305.92 --> 3310.0
start to hallucinate from that i have

3309.119 --> 3312.96
yeah

3310.0 --> 3315.52
it's on that level it's really painful

3312.96 --> 3317.2
it's not jokingly painful it's not like

3315.52 --> 3319.2
ah i don't like

3317.2 --> 3323.04
i don't like being slapped or something

3319.2 --> 3325.52
right no it's really [ __ ] painful

3323.04 --> 3329.2
if you've stuck into that for a long

3325.52 --> 3331.2
time it's very painful

3329.2 --> 3334.0
yeah does it mean that we should have

3331.2 --> 3334.8799999999997
mercy on the anti-flat earthers because

3334.0 --> 3337.2
they

3334.88 --> 3339.44
don't snap out of it even when they do

3337.2 --> 3341.68
face the pain

3339.44 --> 3344.64
they're like the ultimate treacherous

3341.68 --> 3345.359
henchmen of their captors

3344.64 --> 3347.839
like

3345.359 --> 3350.0789999999997
real stupid goblins right and they don't

3347.839 --> 3352.72
deserve mercy because they have faced

3350.079 --> 3355.04
the pain and then they still double down

3352.72 --> 3357.359
on it

3355.04 --> 3360.359
yeah or that you can't help people like

3357.359 --> 3360.359
that

3364.4 --> 3369.04
letting go of this was easy for me well

3366.64 --> 3372.96
i take it you're a girl right

3369.04 --> 3376.079
in my experience a lot of women

3372.96 --> 3378.799
that actually are good in the role of

3376.079 --> 3381.6800000000003
women and not like i have to be

3378.799 --> 3384.319
modern i have to be everything but

3381.68 --> 3387.839
normal right if you're not like that

3384.319 --> 3389.119
if you're actually a typical

3387.839 --> 3392.24
natural

3389.119 --> 3394.559
woman then most women don't have trouble

3392.24 --> 3396.799
with it men have trouble with it more

3394.559 --> 3398.7200000000003
much more that's why the vast majority

3396.799 --> 3400.96
of

3398.72 --> 3402.9599999999996
of flat earthers and anti-flat earthers

3400.96 --> 3405.52
are men

3402.96 --> 3408.2400000000002
is because women on average when they're

3405.52 --> 3409.44
actually women they have less trouble

3408.24 --> 3410.4799999999996
with it

3409.44 --> 3413.28
it's

3410.48 --> 3415.359
less dramatic to them the switch i don't

3413.28 --> 3417.599
know why it's just the way it is

3415.359 --> 3421.2799999999997
you're a male oh okay why the hell will

3417.599 --> 3421.28
you call yourself kimberly then

3431.44 --> 3433.839
the [ __ ]

3435.04 --> 3441.799
what kind of a man's name is kimberly

3437.92 --> 3441.799
never heard of that ever

3456.319 --> 3461.7599999999998
ah yeah you are goldie good to know

3459.599 --> 3463.76
yeah but i've noticed that

3461.76 --> 3466.3190000000004
it's like all the people that i've

3463.76 --> 3467.76
talked to in person and confronted them

3466.319 --> 3470.0
with flat earth

3467.76 --> 3472.6400000000003
all the women

3470.0 --> 3474.72
were a lot easier they were a lot like

3472.64 --> 3477.44
okay

3474.72 --> 3480.3999999999996
right most of them while men were like

3477.44 --> 3483.2000000000003
oh jesus it's the enemy really they

3480.4 --> 3485.28
would respond like oh god what is this

3483.2 --> 3487.04
we got an enemy

3485.28 --> 3490.2400000000002
women don't respond

3487.04 --> 3492.319
to flat earth like that never seen it

3490.24 --> 3494.4799999999996
i mean some of them got a bit scared and

3492.319 --> 3495.52
they thought like oh are you like a nazi

3494.48 --> 3497.28
or something

3495.52 --> 3499.7599999999998
and that's it that's like the the

3497.28 --> 3503.8390000000004
biggest overreaction i've had from women

3499.76 --> 3503.8390000000004
when i face them with letters that's it

3510.559 --> 3515.92
darwin wouldn't know what would know

3513.119 --> 3516.799
whether kimberly is a man or a woman's

3515.92 --> 3520.52
name

3516.799 --> 3520.52
what are you talking about

3530.799 --> 3536.64
right back yeah good point it could be

3533.52 --> 3539.52
it could be that it's just

3536.64 --> 3541.7599999999998
more painful to men to realize that they

3539.52 --> 3545.359
were fooled all their lives

3541.76 --> 3548.4
compared to women which i guess

3545.359 --> 3548.4
it's kind of different

3550.559 --> 3554.8390000000004
they're more used to it i guess

3558.079 --> 3562.48
but yeah if you're suddenly

3559.92 --> 3564.079
like oh you actually suck as a navigator

3562.48 --> 3566.079
you actually thought it was a globe when

3564.079 --> 3568.799
it obviously isn't so you suck as a

3566.079 --> 3570.799
navigator right well that's gonna hurt

3568.799 --> 3573.359
your ego

3570.799 --> 3575.359
it it does well if you don't if you

3573.359 --> 3576.64
don't have like oh i'm a navigator

3575.359 --> 3578.24
because you're like a woman and you're

3576.64 --> 3580.24
like no i'm

3578.24 --> 3582.16
i'm just taking care of my friends and

3580.24 --> 3585.52
my family right well then you don't

3582.16 --> 3587.68
really care it's like oh oh

3585.52 --> 3589.7599999999998
it wasn't a ball okay

3587.68 --> 3592.0789999999997
fine doesn't really matter you know i'm

3589.76 --> 3593.3590000000004
still gonna go where i'm gonna go and

3592.079 --> 3597.4
right

3593.359 --> 3597.4
if you have no pride in that

3616.559 --> 3619.8390000000004
it's been happening all your life

3620.72 --> 3624.48
but why did your parents give you that

3622.72 --> 3626.48
name

3624.48 --> 3629.64
i mean is it like based on some kind of

3626.48 --> 3629.64
a legend

3630.64 --> 3634.96
because otherwise it just seems like a

3632.559 --> 3637.28
really confusing name to give to your

3634.96 --> 3637.28
boy

3638.0 --> 3641.64
if you know what i mean

3654.559 --> 3658.6400000000003
thinking way more little boys grow up

3656.96 --> 3661.2
fantasizing about space travel than

3658.64 --> 3662.4
girls do well i can personally testify

3661.2 --> 3664.8799999999997
to that

3662.4 --> 3667.599
dude i was more in space than in the

3664.88 --> 3668.88
physical reality when like during my

3667.599 --> 3671.76
pre-teens

3668.88 --> 3674.88
like all of it it was just me in space

3671.76 --> 3677.44
it's just constantly i was just i

3674.88 --> 3678.6400000000003
i looked more in my imagination space

3677.44 --> 3682.599
world

3678.64 --> 3682.5989999999997
than in the physical reality

3684.559 --> 3687.119
so yeah

3687.76 --> 3692.0
come on boy name in jamaica oh you're in

3690.559 --> 3693.0400000000004
jamaica

3692.0 --> 3695.839
all right

3693.04 --> 3699.839
okay okay that explains

3695.839 --> 3699.839
right i didn't catch that

3700.64 --> 3705.5589999999997
jamika

3702.4 --> 3705.559
all right

3726.559 --> 3731.079
cool

3727.92 --> 3731.079
all right

3736.63 --> 3739.7490000000003
[Music]

3744.16 --> 3751.359
west indian is west indies

3748.319 --> 3751.359
yeah that's well

3751.599 --> 3757.92
isn't that basically like the west of

3755.119 --> 3757.92
indonesia

3759.76 --> 3764.96
like even in dutch it's very confusing

3762.079 --> 3764.96
confusing because

3765.359 --> 3769.5989999999997
it's like

3766.4 --> 3772.48
it's so close like indonesia

3769.599 --> 3774.88
thing like somebody from indonesia or

3772.48 --> 3776.72
somebody from india we basically in the

3774.88 --> 3777.76
netherlands pronounce it exactly the

3776.72 --> 3781.24
same

3777.76 --> 3781.2400000000002
it's kind of confusing

3798.559 --> 3802.3190000000004
correcting yourself from where

3803.359 --> 3806.16
i don't see it

3807.92 --> 3810.92
anyway

3844.96 --> 3848.039
all right

3846.88 --> 3851.359
yeah i think

3848.039 --> 3854.7990000000004
rastafarianism is really interesting

3851.359 --> 3857.359
like it is really interesting

3854.799 --> 3857.359
it's like

3858.24 --> 3865.319
it is like christian

3860.48 --> 3865.319
in my opinion but it's just

3867.44 --> 3870.079
specific

3874.0 --> 3878.079
i always thought that it was fascinating

3875.839 --> 3880.0789999999997
from rastafarianism that

3878.079 --> 3882.319
they basically say like yeah smoking

3880.079 --> 3884.799
cannabis is actually

3882.319 --> 3886.799
it's not just drug use you can get

3884.799 --> 3889.0389999999998
closer

3886.799 --> 3892.88
to christ with that to

3889.039 --> 3894.7200000000003
to god to good things and i can attest

3892.88 --> 3897.119
to that

3894.72 --> 3899.2799999999997
but yeah not everybody uses cannabis

3897.119 --> 3901.44
like that there's people that just like

3899.28 --> 3903.44
use it like drugs they use it to numb

3901.44 --> 3906.839
themselves or they use it to basically

3903.44 --> 3910.559
turn themselves into a demon

3906.839 --> 3913.359
right you can use it like that as well

3910.559 --> 3916.7200000000003
so it's all about how do you

3913.359 --> 3919.44
as a person using it approach it

3916.72 --> 3922.48
what are you thinking when you inhale it

3919.44 --> 3923.44
right all of that matters

3922.48 --> 3926.64
and

3923.44 --> 3928.96
that realization for me came from

3926.64 --> 3930.64
rastafarianism

3928.96 --> 3933.359
they were the first to basically point

3930.64 --> 3933.359
that out to me

3933.599 --> 3937.839
and that was even before i started

3935.44 --> 3937.839
smoking

3942.4 --> 3947.28
it's very much christian

3944.64 --> 3947.2799999999997
right it's

3947.68 --> 3951.839
yeah it's different though

3952.799 --> 3958.24
right

3954.16 --> 3958.24
but it is it is yeah

3958.64 --> 3962.64
it's different but it it i i do

3961.52 --> 3966.16
like

3962.64 --> 3968.5589999999997
uh what do you say recognize it as such

3966.16 --> 3971.0389999999998
and anybody that poo poo's that i'm like

3968.559 --> 3971.92
okay i'm gonna just [ __ ] on you because

3971.039 --> 3972.7990000000004
you

3971.92 --> 3975.039
like

3972.799 --> 3977.44
yeah

3975.039 --> 3979.92
what you're holding on to dogma oh it's

3977.44 --> 3983.839
too too different from your dogma so

3979.92 --> 3987.2000000000003
it's not christian well go [ __ ] yourself

3983.839 --> 3987.2
that's my response to that

3988.799 --> 3992.88
pantheism

3991.52 --> 3994.72
okay

3992.88 --> 3997.839
well if you can point out to me how

3994.72 --> 3999.68
catholicism is in pantheism

3997.839 --> 4002.68
then yeah we can continue that

3999.68 --> 4002.68
conversation

4009.119 --> 4013.52
that's right kimberly it does it

4011.039 --> 4014.3190000000004
amplifies i've known that since the very

4013.52 --> 4016.64
first

4014.319 --> 4020.0
times i started smoking is

4016.64 --> 4022.96
cannabis is an amplifier it amplifies

4020.0 --> 4022.96
whatever you got

4023.68 --> 4029.359
feel sexy you feel sexy if you feel

4026.72 --> 4030.72
sleepy you'll feel sleepy if you're kind

4029.359 --> 4033.2799999999997
of hungry

4030.72 --> 4035.7599999999998
you get really hungry

4033.28 --> 4038.4
if you're like super zen you'll get

4035.76 --> 4039.2000000000003
magazine

4038.4 --> 4041.119
right

4039.2 --> 4043.2799999999997
but it can

4041.119 --> 4044.96
like if you use it too much then it can

4043.28 --> 4048.0
kind of start to

4044.96 --> 4051.2
destabilize depending i guess on your

4048.0 --> 4053.52
genetic heritage i think that probably

4051.2 --> 4055.0389999999998
people from jamaica don't have that

4053.52 --> 4057.68
issue as much

4055.039 --> 4060.2400000000002
i personally do have it a bit right so i

4057.68 --> 4063.359
have to i've been smoking like more than

4060.24 --> 4065.5989999999997
half my life cannabis

4063.359 --> 4068.96
but i've always had to be careful with

4065.599 --> 4068.96
it always every time

4071.839 --> 4075.599
because i'm just really sensitive and

4073.76 --> 4078.3190000000004
sometimes then

4075.599 --> 4078.319
i yeah

4080.48 --> 4085.119
it can go astray it can lead my mind

4082.88 --> 4088.559
astray if i'm like just

4085.119 --> 4090.4
just got some kind of paranoia

4088.559 --> 4095.2400000000002
thought some really dark thoughts about

4090.4 --> 4095.2400000000002
usually like media related you know

4104.48 --> 4108.879999999999
then it can really jump at you

4107.359 --> 4111.04
right

4108.88 --> 4112.56
if you're like smoking and you get bad

4111.04 --> 4114.4
news right

4112.56 --> 4115.6
like really bad news right when you're

4114.4 --> 4119.839
smoking

4115.6 --> 4119.839
that can really [ __ ] you up

4122.319 --> 4126.719
that's my experience because then

4124.719 --> 4129.199
you're really sensitive suddenly the

4126.719 --> 4131.839
ideas just smack you in the face and

4129.199 --> 4135.12
then they they take root and start to do

4131.839 --> 4138.5599999999995
things right you start to think about it

4135.12 --> 4138.5599999999995
whether you want to or not

4138.719 --> 4143.679
like i've had like really [ __ ]

4140.96 --> 4145.44
annoying experiences like that where i

4143.679 --> 4147.839
would just like be like oh chill and

4145.44 --> 4150.0
then i don't know alex jones or somebody

4147.839 --> 4152.08
like that just starts like

4150.0 --> 4154.88
raping children and i'm gonna torture

4152.08 --> 4156.96
them like this and then it's like

4154.88 --> 4159.839
[ __ ]

4156.96 --> 4161.6
now and then i like end up just not

4159.839 --> 4164.799
getting that [ __ ] out of my head for

4161.6 --> 4166.88
hours really aggravating

4164.799 --> 4169.839
but i would actually i really have to

4166.88 --> 4172.400000000001
focus to just stop

4169.839 --> 4174.799
having that imagery in my head

4172.4 --> 4177.3589999999995
because i wasn't expecting it and it was

4174.799 --> 4181.5199999999995
just chilling soaking and then just ah

4177.359 --> 4181.52
freaking nightmare slap you in the face

4184.88 --> 4189.279
right so you got to be careful

4187.12 --> 4191.44
when you smoke as to what's coming at

4189.279 --> 4191.4400000000005
you

4193.359 --> 4199.1990000000005
too much smoking watch your brain thank

4195.36 --> 4199.199
you oh [ __ ] off [ __ ]

4199.679 --> 4202.56
it does not

4201.28 --> 4204.48
yeah

4202.56 --> 4207.280000000001
it's the freaking hilarious thing about

4204.48 --> 4208.718999999999
it it's the one thing it doesn't do

4207.28 --> 4210.88
yeah

4208.719 --> 4212.4800000000005
i mean most drugs

4210.88 --> 4214.2390000000005
rot your rain

4212.48 --> 4216.799999999999
yeah

4214.239 --> 4217.919999999999
cockroach your brain

4216.8 --> 4220.2390000000005
uh

4217.92 --> 4222.0
math wrote your brain heroin wrote your

4220.239 --> 4224.32
brain

4222.0 --> 4226.239
all that [ __ ] all the drugs stay right

4224.32 --> 4229.5199999999995
your baby one thing that doesn't

4226.239 --> 4231.199
actually do that is cannabis yeah

4229.52 --> 4233.76
but you can

4231.199 --> 4237.04
basically smoke the [ __ ] out of yourself

4233.76 --> 4239.280000000001
and just completely numb yourself out

4237.04 --> 4242.56
but even then there is nobody that's

4239.28 --> 4244.8
ever died from cannabis ever

4242.56 --> 4246.4800000000005
you can't overdose it you can knock

4244.8 --> 4248.08
yourself out

4246.48 --> 4250.44
but you're never gonna have lasting

4248.08 --> 4252.5599999999995
damage you know why because of the

4250.44 --> 4255.159
cannabinoids in there

4252.56 --> 4258.400000000001
that are literally

4255.159 --> 4259.28
regeneration hormones

4258.4 --> 4261.679
yeah

4259.28 --> 4265.28
cannabinoids are like regeneration

4261.679 --> 4267.679
hormones that you can take externally

4265.28 --> 4270.8
and your body's made for that

4267.679 --> 4273.76
so yeah it promotes regeneration it does

4270.8 --> 4277.52
anything but rot your brain

4273.76 --> 4277.52
it actually does the opposite

4279.92 --> 4282.159
right

4280.719 --> 4286.8
but yeah don't

4282.159 --> 4289.199
like don't eat like 10

4286.8 --> 4291.28
like cannabis brownies a day or

4289.199 --> 4294.0
something right then

4291.28 --> 4297.199
yeah there you can poison yourself with

4294.0 --> 4300.8
water okay you can literally overdose on

4297.199 --> 4302.96
water so if you take that into mind yeah

4300.8 --> 4305.1990000000005
limitations

4302.96 --> 4305.199
duh

4308.159 --> 4311.599999999999
it doesn't rot your brain it steals your

4309.92 --> 4314.56
soul oh okay

4311.6 --> 4316.320000000001
well that makes it all right then rick

4314.56 --> 4319.280000000001
back

4316.32 --> 4323.12
to my book that's pretty much the same

4319.28 --> 4325.04
i mean are you gonna get your soul back

4323.12 --> 4328.28
right are you gonna be able to restore

4325.04 --> 4328.28
from that

4342.0 --> 4345.36
basically why i quit listening to alex

4343.76 --> 4346.4800000000005
jones so much yeah

4345.36 --> 4350.32
i get that

4346.48 --> 4350.32
i still listen to him because

4350.56 --> 4356.0
of professional reasons

4353.76 --> 4359.92
it's kind of like he's part of my

4356.0 --> 4359.92
psychology study has been for

4360.48 --> 4363.12
damn

4361.52 --> 4365.6
15 years

4363.12 --> 4365.599999999999
pretty much

4366.0 --> 4372.4
and so i kind of i keep track of what's

4368.56 --> 4374.8
going on with him and also of his

4372.4 --> 4376.96
swing of the pendulum i'm very curiou

4374.8 --> 4378.88
because i think that in ways he is just

4376.96 --> 4381.12
as sensitive as i am

4378.88 --> 4385.0
except he's like really used to just

4381.12 --> 4385.0
blowing up all the time

4387.36 --> 4390.32
right

4389.28 --> 4392.88
and

4390.32 --> 4396.159
i kind of need to know for my media

4392.88 --> 4399.76
studies too because there's huge amount

4396.159 --> 4402.08
of people listening to him a lot of them

4399.76 --> 4403.92
do not really know how to protect

4402.08 --> 4406.4
themselves and distinguish between

4403.92 --> 4408.64
propaganda and non-propaganda

4406.4 --> 4411.199
so i kind of need to know

4408.64 --> 4413.4400000000005
what's going on out there right because

4411.199 --> 4416.719
when he spouts super

4413.44 --> 4420.239
super dark [ __ ]

4416.719 --> 4423.76
that's gonna echo along out there i need

4420.239 --> 4426.4
to be aware about that

4423.76 --> 4428.8
right just to know what's out there and

4426.4 --> 4430.159
that's part of the reason why i still

4428.8 --> 4434.56
watch that

4430.159 --> 4436.639999999999
because if i watch alex jones just

4434.56 --> 4439.120000000001
for the entertainment yeah then it's get

4436.64 --> 4441.679
it gets really annoying at times i mean

4439.12 --> 4444.08
i

4441.679 --> 4447.76
say 10 years ago i i wouldn't turn it

4444.08 --> 4450.96
off right i'd be like what what what now

4447.76 --> 4453.04
i'm like okay alex that's great go [ __ ]

4450.96 --> 4454.96
yourself i'm gonna do something else

4453.04 --> 4456.48
i'll just get back like in 50 minutes

4454.96 --> 4460.8
when you stop

4456.48 --> 4460.799999999999
spouting that disgusting darkness [ __ ]

4462.4 --> 4464.639999999999
right

4465.92 --> 4469.84
but i still have to know about it

4472.56 --> 4477.84
because that's the influence and in ways

4475.679 --> 4479.36
he is touching upon influence that's

4477.84 --> 4481.679
already there too

4479.36 --> 4484.88
it's not like every

4481.679 --> 4486.08
all the darkness all comes from him

4484.88 --> 4487.679
he's

4486.08 --> 4490.88
picking it out

4487.679 --> 4490.88
of the world himself

4492.0 --> 4497.08
anyway i keep track for professional

4494.08 --> 4497.08
reasons

4497.84 --> 4501.1990000000005
although these days guys he's not even

4500.239 --> 4503.44
like

4501.199 --> 4506.4
doing

4503.44 --> 4509.599999999999
live radio himself as much anymore he's

4506.4 --> 4513.04
like away a lot

4509.6 --> 4513.04
don't know what the [ __ ] he's doing

4519.92 --> 4525.6
i mean he says he's working all the time

4522.64 --> 4527.52
i seriously don't believe a freaking

4525.6 --> 4529.92
word of that

4527.52 --> 4532.159000000001
no way

4529.92 --> 4534.56
i mean i'm sure he's always thinking i

4532.159 --> 4536.48
believe that i'm always thinking yeah

4534.56 --> 4538.56
but i'm not gonna say like oh i'm

4536.48 --> 4542.959999999999
working for

4538.56 --> 4545.04
16 hours a day just to do this

4542.96 --> 4548.4
no

4545.04 --> 4550.48
but it's always running in my mind

4548.4 --> 4551.44
it's always updating

4550.48 --> 4553.199
right

4551.44 --> 4555.599999999999
i think he's probably doing that too but

4553.199 --> 4557.678999999999
he's saying like oh i'm working so hard

4555.6 --> 4559.76
i'm working constantly i don't have any

4557.679 --> 4561.52
time for a break it's like

4559.76 --> 4564.52
right

4561.52 --> 4564.52
right

4569.84 --> 4572.84
so

4598.48 --> 4603.04
use moderation in moderation that's

4601.28 --> 4605.28
hilarious

4603.04 --> 4607.28
and contradicting though because if you

4605.28 --> 4609.5199999999995
use moderation in moderation that means

4607.28 --> 4610.8
that sometimes you're going to be

4609.52 --> 4612.719
excessive

4610.8 --> 4614.64
break back

4612.719 --> 4616.08
so

4614.64 --> 4618.88
no i don't think you should use

4616.08 --> 4621.199
moderation in moderation you should just

4618.88 --> 4623.84
use moderation

4621.199 --> 4623.839999999999
this is

4650.0 --> 4654.0
alex won't talk about flat earth or

4651.84 --> 4657.6
planes no play yeah but why the hell

4654.0 --> 4659.84
would he talk about no planes

4657.6 --> 4662.88
it's completely pointless rig back why

4659.84 --> 4665.52
the [ __ ] would he talk about that

4662.88 --> 4666.4800000000005
like why

4665.52 --> 4668.719
why

4666.48 --> 4672.5599999999995
would he talk about that even if it was

4668.719 --> 4674.96
true why the [ __ ] would he do that

4672.56 --> 4677.280000000001
what's the point

4674.96 --> 4680.32
it's super niche

4677.28 --> 4682.5599999999995
it's just confusing it doesn't actually

4680.32 --> 4684.239
change anything about the entire

4682.56 --> 4686.080000000001
situation

4684.239 --> 4689.5199999999995
why the [ __ ] would he talk about no

4686.08 --> 4693.04
planes seriously

4689.52 --> 4696.159000000001
yeah flat earth duh his entire

4693.04 --> 4699.679
vernacular is drenched in globe

4696.159 --> 4702.4
reference in in futurist globe sci-fi

4699.679 --> 4704.56
reference we're going to the stars

4702.4 --> 4707.199
why can't we just come together and go

4704.56 --> 4710.320000000001
to the stars yep duh of course he's

4707.199 --> 4713.199
never gonna talk about flat earth yeah

4710.32 --> 4716.5599999999995
he does allow other people

4713.199 --> 4717.759999999999
i mean david weiss has been on the alex

4716.56 --> 4721.120000000001
jones show

4717.76 --> 4724.159000000001
several times

4721.12 --> 4725.36
about that

4724.159 --> 4731.04
so

4725.36 --> 4733.839999999999
yeah but alex jones is a baltard

4731.04 --> 4735.28
he is he is a bald heart he refuses to

4733.84 --> 4737.52
snap out of it

4735.28 --> 4740.4
he thinks he can live the rest of his

4737.52 --> 4742.2390000000005
life without realizing the earth is flat

4740.4 --> 4745.28
fine

4742.239 --> 4746.799999999999
right he doesn't fire people for talking

4745.28 --> 4749.12
about flat earth

4746.8 --> 4751.360000000001
i mean owen troyer

4749.12 --> 4752.48
and harrison smith they have mentioned

4751.36 --> 4754.799999999999
it

4752.48 --> 4757.678999999999
owen even like kind of was like yeah

4754.8 --> 4757.679
maybe it is flat

4758.56 --> 4761.84
no

4759.44 --> 4765.239
he's not an anti-flat earther he's just

4761.84 --> 4765.2390000000005
kind of a globetron

4776.719 --> 4782.0
strikes me it's a shin

4779.12 --> 4784.08
a shield no that's not what a shill is a

4782.0 --> 4786.0
shield is somebody that brings up a

4784.08 --> 4788.159
subject

4786.0 --> 4791.6
for money

4788.159 --> 4792.799999999999
usually that they don't believe in yeah

4791.6 --> 4794.64
a shill

4792.8 --> 4797.360000000001
is not somebody that

4794.64 --> 4800.400000000001
doesn't ring something up

4797.36 --> 4802.719
for money that's not a shill

4800.4 --> 4806.719
that's kind of the exact opposite of a

4802.719 --> 4809.36
shield that's somebody self-censoring

4806.719 --> 4812.08
yeah a shield is somebody that

4809.36 --> 4814.799999999999
advertises for something that they don't

4812.08 --> 4815.84
actually believe in for financial

4814.8 --> 4817.28
reasons

4815.84 --> 4820.0
or for

4817.28 --> 4824.8
social hierarchy reasons yeah that's not

4820.0 --> 4824.8
what that is rick peck get it straight

4829.84 --> 4836.88
i mean he's a shill for nasa

4832.639 --> 4842.639
yeah yeah he is alex jones is a shill

4836.88 --> 4842.639
for nasa and he's probably proud of it

4843.52 --> 4847.320000000001
and that's about it

4858.8 --> 4861.6
and i

4859.6 --> 4863.52
don't even think that he's even a chill

4861.6 --> 4865.76
for now i just genuinely thinks he

4863.52 --> 4868.080000000001
freaking loves it

4865.76 --> 4869.76
he wants to be part of that he wants to

4868.08 --> 4871.92
be part of that dream and he wants to

4869.76 --> 4874.92
believe it

4871.92 --> 4874.92
right

4891.679 --> 4897.1990000000005
yeah a guy who wanted to work for the

4893.92 --> 4899.1990000000005
world wrestling feather yeah well

4897.199 --> 4900.96
he certainly has the talent for that

4899.199 --> 4903.839999999999
[ __ ]

4900.96 --> 4903.84
loud

4905.679 --> 4909.12
you know loud guy

4912.08 --> 4917.28
very about

4913.44 --> 4919.04
theatrics very theatrical loud guy yeah

4917.28 --> 4921.04
world wrestling federation yeah that

4919.04 --> 4924.0
that's

4921.04 --> 4924.0
right down his lane

4927.6 --> 4932.400000000001
or it could have been right

4929.44 --> 4932.4
but he didn't do that

4935.84 --> 4942.12
instead

4937.679 --> 4942.12
he got into politics and conspiracies

4946.0 --> 4950.32
which anti-flat earth youtuber do you

4948.32 --> 4952.5599999999995
think are paid by the government all of

4950.32 --> 4952.5599999999995
them

4955.44 --> 4959.48
i don't think any of them

4960.48 --> 4963.28
they're paid by corporate interest

4962.48 --> 4965.44
though

4963.28 --> 4966.639
i mean

4965.44 --> 4969.759999999999
google

4966.639 --> 4974.8
is probably having them around

4969.76 --> 4976.56
and giving them the room to get income

4974.8 --> 4979.6
that's happening there's not the

4976.56 --> 4981.76
government it's just company policy

4979.6 --> 4984.159000000001
which is kind of uniform it's part of

4981.76 --> 4984.96
the plan

4984.159 --> 4987.04
yeah

4984.96 --> 4988.88
the beast plan

4987.04 --> 4991.679
that's not the government literally

4988.88 --> 4992.719
giving them checks for it yeah it's

4991.679 --> 4995.28
they don't

4992.719 --> 4998.159
need to do that

4995.28 --> 5001.28
that's the point they don't need to do

4998.159 --> 5004.32
that anymore they don't need to do that

5001.28 --> 5007.04
they don't need that paper trail

5004.32 --> 5008.88
government doesn't need to assign people

5007.04 --> 5010.4
to do that [ __ ]

5008.88 --> 5012.32
it's fully

5010.4 --> 5016.96
automated

5012.32 --> 5019.44
all of it it's pure robotics yeah nobody

5016.96 --> 5021.92
has to ever know that it's even

5019.44 --> 5024.879999999999
happening because it's fully automated

5021.92 --> 5025.679
it's just part of the program

5024.88 --> 5027.679
right

5025.679 --> 5029.76
algorithm favoriting

5027.679 --> 5031.4400000000005
it's the corporations that do that

5029.76 --> 5035.12
government has freaking

5031.44 --> 5036.96
very very little to do with it i mean

5035.12 --> 5041.04
at best

5036.96 --> 5045.04
they like throw a piece of cash

5041.04 --> 5046.8
at those mega corporations that do it

5045.04 --> 5049.04
that's as far as it goes

5046.8 --> 5052.56
there's no paper trail to any of these

5049.04 --> 5056.5199999999995
numpties doing this it's fully automated

5052.56 --> 5056.52
they don't even know

5078.56 --> 5083.4400000000005
yeah so no

5081.04 --> 5085.679
no anti-flat earther is being paid by

5083.44 --> 5088.638999999999
the government

5085.679 --> 5088.639
it's ridiculous

5089.44 --> 5096.239
like it's ineffective

5092.159 --> 5098.32
it just makes a giant paper trail

5096.239 --> 5102.959999999999
right you don't need to do that it's

5098.32 --> 5104.5599999999995
just like no they take up positions

5102.96 --> 5107.36
semantically

5104.56 --> 5110.080000000001
that are automatically arranged in a

5107.36 --> 5113.679
certain category of algorithm which will

5110.08 --> 5116.96
favor them which will make them richer

5113.679 --> 5120.2390000000005
nobody's giving them a check

5116.96 --> 5122.32
especially government that's ridiculous

5120.239 --> 5124.4
that's not happening it's a really

5122.32 --> 5126.639
stupid myth

5124.4 --> 5129.92
just like everything is a shill when

5126.639 --> 5134.08
people don't even know what a shill is

5129.92 --> 5137.28
yeah if you censor yourself

5134.08 --> 5139.28
that's not a shell it's the opposite a

5137.28 --> 5141.759999999999
shield is somebody

5139.28 --> 5144.32
that talks about a product that's trying

5141.76 --> 5146.56
to sell something that they personally

5144.32 --> 5149.759999999999
don't actually believe in they're acting

5146.56 --> 5152.84
like that yeah that's a shill

5149.76 --> 5155.4400000000005
censoring yourself is not

5152.84 --> 5157.1990000000005
chilling it's the opposite it's

5155.44 --> 5160.0
ridiculous

5157.199 --> 5162.08
so just these conceptions about how

5160.0 --> 5164.719
things work it just

5162.08 --> 5164.719
just stop

5164.88 --> 5167.88
stop

5178.0 --> 5182.96
google is government controlled control

5180.32 --> 5185.599999999999
yeah sure i'm going with that george

5182.96 --> 5188.32
sanford duh

5185.6 --> 5190.4800000000005
google is a freaking government program

5188.32 --> 5192.639
what the [ __ ] you want

5190.48 --> 5194.638999999999
is literally created by government so

5192.639 --> 5198.32
yeah what do you expect

5194.639 --> 5201.28
but it isn't the government

5198.32 --> 5204.96
there's no person in congress or the

5201.28 --> 5207.12
senate writing out checks to pay

5204.96 --> 5209.52
anti-flat earthers that's

5207.12 --> 5210.96
idiotic to even think that that's the

5209.52 --> 5213.84
case

5210.96 --> 5215.679
i mean come on

5213.84 --> 5218.32
that's not how it works it's just fully

5215.679 --> 5218.32
automated

5221.36 --> 5226.96
there's no paper trails like that they

5223.6 --> 5228.08
don't need that anymore

5226.96 --> 5233.8
it's just

5228.08 --> 5233.8
a hassle in the future if you do that

5244.159 --> 5250.4
why would you send a check

5248.0 --> 5252.8
and make yourself directly connected to

5250.4 --> 5256.12
that person when you can just

5252.8 --> 5258.719
create an algorithm that literally will

5256.12 --> 5262.08
automatically favor those

5258.719 --> 5264.4
who speak out things

5262.08 --> 5265.6
that is useful for you

5264.4 --> 5267.759999999999
yeah

5265.6 --> 5270.400000000001
why would you ever need to write a check

5267.76 --> 5273.04
to anybody ever when you can just have a

5270.4 --> 5276.08
fully automated system that will just

5273.04 --> 5278.719
reward on the spot somebody

5276.08 --> 5280.639
without even letting them know but just

5278.719 --> 5282.719
putting them automatically in a more

5280.639 --> 5284.159000000001
favorable position to get money from

5282.719 --> 5286.159
people

5284.159 --> 5287.04
yeah

5286.159 --> 5288.32
that's

5287.04 --> 5290.48
like

5288.32 --> 5292.719
so much more efficient

5290.48 --> 5295.12
there's no paper trail it's just like oh

5292.719 --> 5296.96
you say the right things in this moment

5295.12 --> 5299.36
you're gonna be pushed up the ladder

5296.96 --> 5301.44
you're gonna receive more money not

5299.36 --> 5304.4
through a contract but because you're

5301.44 --> 5308.4
just put into a more favored position

5304.4 --> 5309.599999999999
without people even knowing it

5308.4 --> 5312.879999999999
yeah

5309.6 --> 5315.84
why the hell would you ever

5312.88 --> 5318.719
bribe or pay

5315.84 --> 5322.96
somebody to chill then

5318.719 --> 5325.12

5322.96 --> 5326.32
it's a late

5325.12 --> 5329.84
20th

5326.32 --> 5331.28
century myth this is the 21st century it

5329.84 --> 5332.8
doesn't work like that anymore it

5331.28 --> 5335.599999999999
doesn't need to

5332.8 --> 5339.6
it's completely outdated to think that

5335.6 --> 5339.6
that's still happening it doesn't

5347.44 --> 5350.5599999999995
right and then there's that goldie

5348.88 --> 5352.719
mckerman yeah there's plenty of

5350.56 --> 5355.92
anti-flat earthers that just love being

5352.719 --> 5355.92
an anti-flat earther

5356.8 --> 5362.4800000000005
who is the richest ntfe content creator

5360.0 --> 5365.199

and i don't know how he's gotten that

5374.239 --> 5380.959999999999
money right roofie could be some kind of

5377.76 --> 5383.04
a weird dubious government contractor in

5380.96 --> 5385.44
some way i don't even know what he does

5383.04 --> 5387.199
i just know

5385.44 --> 5389.759999999999
through other people that apparently

5387.199 --> 5391.759999999999
he's freaking loaded

5389.76 --> 5395.04
probably the the richest person you'll

5391.76 --> 5395.04
ever meet on the internet

5398.8 --> 5404.2390000000005
although is it even his money or is it

5400.96 --> 5406.639
just like an unlimited credit system he

5404.239 --> 5409.28
has available like you can

5406.639 --> 5411.4400000000005
withdraw as much money as you ever

5409.28 --> 5413.599999999999
want we don't care

5411.44 --> 5416.799999999999
but he doesn't have it

5413.6 --> 5416.8
could be i don't know

5417.679 --> 5421.84
but yeah the answer would be

5420.48 --> 5425.239
ruhif

5421.84 --> 5425.2390000000005
stevie traveler

5441.44 --> 5445.5199999999995
right but i'm gonna run out the show

5443.199 --> 5448.799999999999
though

5445.52 --> 5451.280000000001
turned out to be pretty good

5448.8 --> 5451.28
what about

5451.36 --> 5457.199
a lot of questions one of the

5454.08 --> 5457.199
detail analysis

5458.48 --> 5462.638999999999
isn't there a flutter i don't know i

5460.159 --> 5464.5599999999995
don't care

5462.639 --> 5467.52
but yeah there are flat earthers that

5464.56 --> 5469.6
have plenty of money i mean david wise

5467.52 --> 5473.280000000001
is not poor

5469.6 --> 5475.6
patricia steer is not poor

5473.28 --> 5479.36
right there's plenty of people that are

5475.6 --> 5479.360000000001
flat earthers that are not poor

5480.239 --> 5484.48
i'm pretty sure jaron is not poor

5483.12 --> 5486.32
anymore

5484.48 --> 5488.32
he's

5486.32 --> 5490.32
he's got a lot more

5488.32 --> 5493.36
financial wealth at this point than he

5490.32 --> 5493.36
did when he started out

5493.52 --> 5497.360000000001
because he just put in a lot of work

5497.92 --> 5500.8
right

5498.8 --> 5504.1990000000005
how do i know his load i've heard it

5500.8 --> 5504.1990000000005
through the guys

5504.8 --> 5510.88
apparently he's like written out some

5507.12 --> 5513.199
insane checks to certain people

5510.88 --> 5515.28
i i don't know it's just what i've heard

5513.199 --> 5518.08
i've heard it it's rumors basically

5515.28 --> 5521.599999999999
steamy traveler it's rumors

5518.08 --> 5521.6
or i mean goldie mckernan

5522.32 --> 5527.28
so yeah i haven't seen any numerical

5524.719 --> 5529.84
value of a bank account or anything i

5527.28 --> 5531.599999999999
don't have solid proof it's just that

5529.84 --> 5534.639
there seems to be a lot of indication

5531.6 --> 5536.88
that he's a billionaire or something

5534.639 --> 5540.639
that's it that's all i got if you want

5536.88 --> 5543.12
to know more you'll have to dig yourself

5540.639 --> 5544.2390000000005
or ask other people like

5543.12 --> 5546.0
tony

5544.239 --> 5548.48
