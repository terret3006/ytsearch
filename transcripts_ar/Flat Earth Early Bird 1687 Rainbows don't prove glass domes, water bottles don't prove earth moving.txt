110.399 --> 118.22
yeah I'm running short so support is

114.84 --> 118.22
going to be directly needed

119.34 --> 124.759
right anyway the weather today again is

122.159 --> 124.759
really beautiful

125.04 --> 127.93900000000001
look at this

129.06 --> 136.379
it's super Clear Blue Sky

132.06 --> 138.78
a couple of clouds but fluffy a little

136.379 --> 143.17999999999998
it's just so nice and blue

138.78 --> 143.18
it had actually been raining this night

143.28 --> 147.78
or this morning but it was while I was

145.98 --> 148.98
sleeping because

147.78 --> 151.8
yeah

148.98 --> 154.61999999999998
I just noticed that the oregano plant

151.8 --> 156.66000000000003
was all drowning again

154.62 --> 158.28
I think that plant in the white pot

156.66 --> 160.57999999999998
there I don't think it's gonna make it

158.28 --> 160.58
really

164.76 --> 168.78
I'm gonna have to figure out a new type

167.099 --> 171.48
of setup for that

168.78 --> 174.06
if I want to keep oregano plants because

171.48 --> 176.22
this is just not working but it's a good

174.06 --> 177.8
lesson to learn all the other plants

176.22 --> 181.8
have been doing great

177.8 --> 183.66000000000003
the basil even though it's like really

181.8 --> 186.06
getting old

183.66 --> 188.819
it's still doing great and it's

186.06 --> 191.64000000000001
continually attracting bees because like

188.819 --> 194.57999999999998
those Lantern strains

191.64 --> 197.51899999999998
keep making new flowers and I

194.58 --> 199.14000000000001
continually see bees just checking them

197.519 --> 202.4
out

199.14 --> 202.39999999999998
with both plants

204.42 --> 206.89999999999998
right

208.14 --> 211.57999999999998
but yeah weather beautiful

215.099 --> 220.61999999999998
feels like a really great summer day

218.58 --> 223.62
um

220.62 --> 226.08
hello watchmaker first in chat Richard G

223.62 --> 232.86
dank good to see you all

226.08 --> 232.86
it is Saturday the 12th of August 2023

233.58 --> 236.36
ah

238.08 --> 243.18
I feel pretty good even though I did go

240.36 --> 244.98000000000002
to bed a bit late I tried not to but

243.18 --> 247.22
there was all kinds of things keeping me

244.98 --> 247.22
up

247.799 --> 254.76000000000002
like even when I try to go to bed

251.7 --> 256.859
like somebody out there was just yapping

254.76 --> 258.419
over the phone and just wouldn't stop it

256.859 --> 260.84
was in the middle of the night like are

258.419 --> 260.84
you crazy

261.12 --> 267.12
uh and then the white cat basically came

265.259 --> 268.5
in and decided that in the middle of the

267.12 --> 270.44
night is the time that I should be

268.5 --> 273.979
giving her food

270.44 --> 273.979
like [ __ ] off

274.32 --> 278.699
yeah

276.72 --> 281.6
do my roommates Health have their own

278.699 --> 281.6
balconies yeah

282.9 --> 285.62
effectively

287.02 --> 293.52
[Music]

289.68 --> 296.58
right anyway my shoulders feeling very

293.52 --> 298.44
well actually and no negative influence

296.58 --> 299.699
from drinking the Gusto energy drink

298.44 --> 302.21999999999997
yesterday

299.699 --> 303.479
so I think the vitamin C is just really

302.22 --> 305.699
working out

303.479 --> 308.4
I haven't really eaten a lot yesterday

305.699 --> 311.58000000000004
but I did get like

308.4 --> 314.28
I did make special spicy soup which is

311.58 --> 315.59999999999997
basically chicken soup with some

314.28 --> 317.28
vermicelli

315.6 --> 319.38
and then

317.28 --> 321.55999999999995
or noodles whatever you call that in

319.38 --> 321.56
English

321.6 --> 325.199
and then add just a whole bunch of

323.699 --> 328.44
spices to it

325.199 --> 332.52000000000004
mainly uh

328.44 --> 338.36
uh tumeric a lot like a lot of turmeric

332.52 --> 338.35999999999996
like it's freaking yellow after that

338.759 --> 343.68
but also uh ginger powder

342.12 --> 347.16
and

343.68 --> 351.919
Chili Pepper powder I just made it like

347.16 --> 351.91900000000004
a really almost like an Indian soup

352.199 --> 355.759
but that did do a lot of good

361.02 --> 365.52
and it also made me think that I really

363.12 --> 367.979
kind of want to make

365.52 --> 370.139
more elaborate dinner like that with

367.979 --> 373.08
some proper chicken

370.139 --> 374.539
and vegetables

373.08 --> 379.19899999999996
ah

374.539 --> 382.94
zero spice gang okay

379.199 --> 382.94
a flat swords perspective

383.759 --> 390.08000000000004
review your stream Oh you mean the

386.4 --> 390.08
stream Where You rev View

390.96 --> 396.62
Dell reviewing Simon then reviewing

394.139 --> 396.62
himself

397.5 --> 401.96
or Simon Dan reviewing that like no

402.6 --> 409.02000000000004
but yeah I did check it out but so I did

406.08 --> 411.24
take a look at it like half of it like

409.02 --> 413.09999999999997
but to be fair flat sorry I'm glad

411.24 --> 417.199
you're into that that you like doing

413.1 --> 417.199
that it's not my thing man I mean

418.02 --> 423.9
I just get really annoyed I mean Dell is

422.1 --> 426.139
such a freaking waste of time at this

423.9 --> 426.13899999999995
point

426.24 --> 430.56
and like

428.039 --> 433.44
like all his follower they're all

430.56 --> 435.539
becoming like belligerent

433.44 --> 438.419
they're acting like little rebellious

435.539 --> 441.479
kids they're just like yeah

438.419 --> 443.46
if you want it my way and it's just I

441.479 --> 447.36
can't take it anymore it's

443.46 --> 450.419
I can make fun of it like did you hear

447.36 --> 454.199
like it's got a new band name flat side

450.419 --> 457.75899999999996
it's called reichi and the Delights

454.199 --> 457.759
figure that out two days ago

458.16 --> 463.03900000000004
it's like an old 50s rock band

463.74 --> 467.0
that just won't stop

468.99 --> 474.56
[Music]

470.52 --> 474.56
even though they're like super outdated

475.08 --> 482.58
yeah so you can take that if you want

478.44 --> 484.44
rating that I to me it makes it feel a

482.58 --> 487.56
little bit more funny instead of just

484.44 --> 490.88
like why do I have to be so stupid why

487.56 --> 490.88
are they being so belligerent

491.419 --> 497.65999999999997
it's just they're just reaching the

493.979 --> 497.65999999999997
Daylights and just kind of leave them

500.58 --> 507.74
I watch flat side's Channel much

502.979 --> 507.74
no not a lot sometimes I do

510.419 --> 514.38
but I mean I'm not gonna sit through one

512.64 --> 517.74
of those Christian Hangouts I mean

514.38 --> 519.0
that's just a waste of time to me but I

517.74 --> 521.339
mean

519.0 --> 524.7
yeah when dealing with anti-flat

521.339 --> 527.1600000000001
earthers or or tell

524.7 --> 531.74
concerning Flat Earth matters yeah I

527.16 --> 531.74
will definitely tune into flatsoids

536.519 --> 541.16
hello Terror 306 by the way good to see

539.04 --> 541.16
you

541.5 --> 545.12
logical observations

554.64 --> 557.64
foreign

561.38 --> 567.14
dude yeah in the more literal sense

587.7 --> 593.1
hey Dr utker good to see you

590.339 --> 597.3800000000001
and let's check the temperature

593.1 --> 597.38
but it's like 21 degrees

598.62 --> 603.38
oh it's 23. huh

603.779 --> 609.54
wow it looks from the forecast of it it

607.5 --> 611.82
looks like it's going to be this kind of

609.54 --> 615.42
weather the coming week

611.82 --> 619.2
23 22 26 23

615.42 --> 621.68
24 25 28

619.2 --> 621.6800000000001
cool

624.18 --> 629.779
nice

625.38 --> 629.779
a nice bit of after summer that's great

631.68 --> 637.4399999999999
Bo Bob you mean Jim Bob

635.279 --> 639.6
not so much yeah

637.44 --> 641.399
but Jim Bob doesn't really give a [ __ ]

639.6 --> 644.22
about Flat Earth

641.399 --> 646.5
and he's not very good at it

644.22 --> 648.36
he was interested for a bit because of

646.5 --> 651.779
like he was interested in Flat Earth

648.36 --> 654.0600000000001
debates because of the debating

651.779 --> 658.04
so he's interested in debating but he's

654.06 --> 658.04
not interested in Flat Earth not really

661.74 --> 666.26
he's more interested in the psychology

663.54 --> 666.26
of it I think

666.86 --> 671.7
but I mean he's like this

669.72 --> 673.6800000000001
for Mia

671.7 --> 676.98
vehement

673.68 --> 679.2199999999999
her man and wet assist and like it's

676.98 --> 679.22
just

681.839 --> 687.9590000000001
a complete waste of time in my opinion

684.6 --> 690.2
hey Bill Nye the science denier good to

687.959 --> 690.1999999999999
see you

697.2 --> 700.74
thank you

698.94 --> 705.5600000000001
correct man I mean I haven't checked out

700.74 --> 705.5600000000001
Jim Bob and in almost a year I think

707.279 --> 713.519
I mean since he got into that [ __ ]

711.06 --> 716.5189999999999
fight with Owen Benjamin it was just

713.519 --> 720.2
like it what became intolerable and like

716.519 --> 720.2
I don't think he's doing too well either

720.959 --> 726.1999999999999
I don't know I haven't actually checked

722.88 --> 726.2
it out in a long time

730.26 --> 736.2
what's wrong with climate change

733.079 --> 739.38
and they want it to be winter all year

736.2 --> 741.12
no they they just want to complain about

739.38 --> 743.1
how everything is wrong and that

741.12 --> 744.0
everybody needs to die to make it all

743.1 --> 746.1
right

744.0 --> 748.38
that's pretty much what it is now truth

746.1 --> 750.48
listener

748.38 --> 752.459
it's like whatever the weather is it's

750.48 --> 754.2
always wrong and if it isn't then they

752.459 --> 756.2399999999999
just lie about it

754.2 --> 759.8000000000001
it's always wrong and people are to

756.24 --> 759.8
blame and they all need to be

760.76 --> 765.6
reduced

762.42 --> 767.7199999999999
that that's what it is it's a pure death

765.6 --> 770.399
cult

767.72 --> 771.5400000000001
weather-based death calls pretty much at

770.399 --> 775.56
this point

771.54 --> 778.079
foreign but I think that most people are

775.56 --> 779.8199999999999
are on to that and even those that would

778.079 --> 782.04
have believed in like oh we're gonna

779.82 --> 784.139
just all work together to improve the

782.04 --> 786.0
environment which is a there's nothing

784.139 --> 789.9590000000001
bad about that

786.0 --> 793.079
they all know like this is just [ __ ]

789.959 --> 795.3599999999999
they people on average have become more

793.079 --> 797.16
informed about how environmentalism

795.36 --> 800.899
actually works

797.16 --> 804.62
and of things like nitrogen is just

800.899 --> 804.62
absolute horseshit

804.72 --> 809.5790000000001
that that that that doesn't make any

807.48 --> 813.66
sense like people are figuring it out

809.579 --> 815.519
there and they know like whatever these

813.66 --> 818.88
stuck up rich

815.519 --> 820.98
private plane flying [ __ ]

818.88 --> 823.26
are saying about the climate and about

820.98 --> 825.48
what we need that it's always going to

823.26 --> 829.019
be wrong it's just a power grab

825.48 --> 831.839
people know that now

829.019 --> 833.82
took them damn long enough but they're

831.839 --> 836.899
they're figuring it out now

833.82 --> 839.339
that like that it's not even like as a

836.899 --> 842.88
money-making Ponzi scheme or something

839.339 --> 845.94
like climate credits that

842.88 --> 848.1
that was probably appealing to a bunch

845.94 --> 850.5600000000001
of ambitious people

848.1 --> 852.36
but that's about it and they know now

850.56 --> 854.76
that it's so horseshit because Yahoo

852.36 --> 857.1
climate credit what the [ __ ] is the

854.76 --> 859.86
purpose of climate credit when

857.1 --> 862.2
like every business is basically getting

859.86 --> 866.16
ruined

862.2 --> 869.279
and and being forced to like

866.16 --> 871.139
forced into real Road it railroaded into

869.279 --> 873.62
certain products and all that it's like

871.139 --> 873.62
no

876.24 --> 881.519
people that are into business have

878.459 --> 884.959
caught on like no this is not gonna lead

881.519 --> 884.9590000000001
to to a winning position

885.019 --> 890.82
so all of it is falling apart and

887.76 --> 893.6
basically only the propaganda machine is

890.82 --> 893.6
what's left now

893.88 --> 900.8389999999999
like news people TV people

897.5 --> 902.519
politicians they're just still echoing

900.839 --> 905.0400000000001
the propaganda but there's no real

902.519 --> 907.399
incentive anymore it's just propaganda

905.04 --> 907.399
now

913.32 --> 917.0600000000001
all right so that's my view on it

918.36 --> 922.279
to Value what

928.459 --> 938.5999999999999
that's weird Terry it's very weird

934.199 --> 938.5999999999999
what is to follow never heard of that

940.68 --> 945.4399999999999
Oceania

942.899 --> 945.44
okay

956.839 --> 961.82
oh is it one of the Marshall Islands or

959.639 --> 961.82
something

965.88 --> 970.56
or it's close to okay so one of the

968.579 --> 973.68
islands in the Pacific

970.56 --> 976.0189999999999
it's going to sink whatever I mean a lot

973.68 --> 980.2199999999999
of those islands have come into being

976.019 --> 983.3
too Islands do sink and new islands also

980.22 --> 983.3000000000001
get created

984.0 --> 989.16
like it's not really a part of entropy

986.76 --> 992.3389999999999
in that sense because it's not like oh

989.16 --> 995.8199999999999
there's literally so much that you can

992.339 --> 998.2790000000001
measure that over all the years have it

995.82 --> 1002.0
has gone down like no

998.279 --> 1004.639
some regions it just goes down and other

1002.0 --> 1007.06
regions suddenly come up that's just

1004.639 --> 1007.0600000000001
what happens

1010.699 --> 1019.88
but to preserve the nation's history

1016.36 --> 1023.6
cultural and geographical they want to

1019.88 --> 1026.6
create a three what a 3D model of it

1023.6 --> 1026.6
wow

1026.78 --> 1032.9189999999999
that's pretty stupid

1029.78 --> 1036.02
but I guess that hey if they want to

1032.919 --> 1038.0590000000002
digitalize an entire Island I'm sure

1036.02 --> 1040.6399999999999
that a lot of games are going to have a

1038.059 --> 1043.459
lot of fun with that I mean if from now

1040.64 --> 1045.16
on you can play GTA

1043.459 --> 1049.46
what's the

1045.16 --> 1054.26
GTA In A Tavola map the value map right

1049.46 --> 1057.74
I mean it could be kind of fun it's not

1054.26 --> 1060.08
without any kind of purpose but

1057.74 --> 1064.0
like oh we need to do it because of

1060.08 --> 1064.0
climate change that's horseshit

1070.16 --> 1075.8600000000001
but if they want to create a 3D model of

1072.679 --> 1078.0800000000002
it for historical preservation right

1075.86 --> 1080.539
well that's just like oh we're gonna

1078.08 --> 1083.48
have we're gonna go around take a couple

1080.539 --> 1087.799
of photographs I mean except now it's a

1083.48 --> 1089.919
3D model in a digital world that's the

1087.799 --> 1089.9189999999999
difference

1090.08 --> 1097.1599999999999
so yeah sure I'm surprised not half or

1095.0 --> 1099.559
like the entire Western world has it

1097.16 --> 1102.14
been completely digitally back

1099.559 --> 1104.4189999999999
engineered yet

1102.14 --> 1107.0
I guess we've all been too preoccupied

1104.419 --> 1110.24
to get to that because I foresaw that

1107.0 --> 1112.16
coming like in the late 90s

1110.24 --> 1114.32
like there's gonna be just an entire

1112.16 --> 1117.88
digitized Society

1114.32 --> 1117.8799999999999
that's gonna run parallel

1118.16 --> 1124.46
when they already did start it even back

1120.62 --> 1127.4189999999999
then sort of was called Second Life

1124.46 --> 1127.419
Second Life yeah

1129.62 --> 1133.6999999999998
and ridiculous but I mean that was

1132.08 --> 1136.6999999999998
already happening so I was like oh yeah

1133.7 --> 1140.38
yeah well they're probably gonna just

1136.7 --> 1144.14
have an entire 3D simulated reality

1140.38 --> 1146.2990000000002
based on the actual world and then like

1144.14 --> 1148.88
digital

1146.299 --> 1150.3799999999999
but that never really happened so it

1148.88 --> 1153.0200000000002
seems or

1150.38 --> 1155.3200000000002
maybe it has and they kept it secret or

1153.02 --> 1155.32
whatever

1159.76 --> 1166.16
but I mean even in the early 2000s I was

1163.88 --> 1167.2990000000002
playing Counter-Strike

1166.16 --> 1170.059
like

1167.299 --> 1173.12
on a map that was literally the building

1170.059 --> 1175.1
of the school that we were all playing

1173.12 --> 1177.1999999999998
Counter-Strike at

1175.1 --> 1179.24
that school was by the way not very

1177.2 --> 1182.96
successful they closed down two years

1179.24 --> 1184.7
later but like I that was a lot of fun

1182.96 --> 1186.2
it's like every we all played

1184.7 --> 1188.48
Counter-Strike on like the computer

1186.2 --> 1191.9
network like with

1188.48 --> 1193.88
20 or 30 people at the same time and

1191.9 --> 1194.96
then somebody made a map of that

1193.88 --> 1198.16
building

1194.96 --> 1198.16
and that was amazing

1204.38 --> 1210.0800000000002
it was a waste of time but it was

1206.419 --> 1214.22
amazing was basically that school those

1210.08 --> 1216.86
two school year was it one year

1214.22 --> 1219.2
yeah I think I only did one year but

1216.86 --> 1222.1
that one year was basically the greatest

1219.2 --> 1222.1000000000001
land party

1222.34 --> 1227.1399999999999
prolonged Lang party that I've ever

1224.72 --> 1227.14
played

1254.36 --> 1258.2199999999998
right anyway

1256.88 --> 1262.9
funny

1258.22 --> 1262.9
digitalized Islands yeah sure

1269.299 --> 1273.86
do I believe it will sink no

1281.24 --> 1286.64
I mean why do they give any like

1284.24 --> 1288.5
mechanical reason as to why it would

1286.64 --> 1290.8600000000001
sink are they saying like oh there's

1288.5 --> 1290.86
this

1291.26 --> 1297.44
ice very deep underneath it and because

1294.919 --> 1300.2
the temperature is going up of the sea

1297.44 --> 1302.659
like it's slowly is melting and that's

1300.2 --> 1304.46
gonna cause it to shrink and then the

1302.659 --> 1305.9
land will collect is it something like

1304.46 --> 1308.48
that I mean do they have any

1305.9 --> 1310.3400000000001
argumentation for it or is it just the

1308.48 --> 1312.14
same old nonsense like oh that Island's

1310.34 --> 1314.24
gonna be underwater because the ocean is

1312.14 --> 1316.539
going to rise which is never gonna

1314.24 --> 1316.539
happen

1318.74 --> 1322.48
so what do they say about it

1340.64 --> 1344.9
yeah

1342.08 --> 1347.539
and the truth listener it is it is just

1344.9 --> 1350.919
fear it is just keeping people in fear

1347.539 --> 1350.919
it's doomsday porn

1351.26 --> 1356.36
and there's a lot of people into that

1354.26 --> 1358.22
because yeah the world kind of sucks and

1356.36 --> 1359.4189999999999
then a lot of people don't know what to

1358.22 --> 1360.98
do with it

1359.419 --> 1363.5
don't know how to handle that and then

1360.98 --> 1366.28
they just start to look forward to the

1363.5 --> 1366.28
ending of it all

1367.1 --> 1371.8999999999999
thank you

1369.2 --> 1373.94
I mean it's basically like a false

1371.9 --> 1375.679
promise that you'll be

1373.94 --> 1378.3200000000002
like

1375.679 --> 1380.419
will put you at the end you'll be put

1378.32 --> 1383.86
out of your misery I mean that's really

1380.419 --> 1383.8600000000001
kind of what it is

1399.44 --> 1404.6000000000001
I say reason is global yeah okay so

1402.02 --> 1407.72
horseshit then there it it's just

1404.6 --> 1410.7199999999998
horseshit okay fair enough

1407.72 --> 1413.72
because I mean some islands do actually

1410.72 --> 1417.919
think you know

1413.72 --> 1420.679
like a more obscure but very prominent

1417.919 --> 1423.5
example would be freeze land which used

1420.679 --> 1428.14
to be a pretty big island

1423.5 --> 1428.14
very near the coast of Iceland

1428.72 --> 1435.8600000000001
that had castles on them and everything

1431.96 --> 1440.059
and it's sadly like just went down

1435.86 --> 1443.6589999999999
just like that completely gone

1440.059 --> 1446.299
like sometimes that just happens

1443.659 --> 1448.48
it's freaky and you never really see it

1446.299 --> 1448.48
coming

1448.94 --> 1453.6200000000001
unless you have visions about the future

1451.34 --> 1456.1
and you can bypass Cassandra complex

1453.62 --> 1456.1
somehow

1456.2 --> 1461.1200000000001
but other than that like you don't it's

1458.419 --> 1465.039
not like a typical geologically

1461.12 --> 1465.039
predictable thing when that happens

1471.039 --> 1477.74
twenty thousand tavulu popular

1474.52 --> 1480.5
well not about climate change I mean I'd

1477.74 --> 1482.059
be more worried about

1480.5 --> 1485.36
huh

1482.059 --> 1488.84
about crazy

1485.36 --> 1491.1399999999999
uh Marine Warfare between China and

1488.84 --> 1491.1399999999999
America

1491.539 --> 1498.74
that can literally break out any moment

1495.38 --> 1501.14
like that's about to happen guys

1498.74 --> 1503.1200000000001
I've seen it

1501.14 --> 1506.1200000000001
like in in this one of the more

1503.12 --> 1508.4599999999998
prominent Vision things that I have been

1506.12 --> 1510.3799999999999
like it had been staring me in the face

1508.46 --> 1512.9
and I remembered that even like years

1510.38 --> 1514.5800000000002
ago I just the problem is with

1512.9 --> 1517.4
everything I've seen I never really know

1514.58 --> 1520.6589999999999
exactly when it is are gonna be there

1517.4 --> 1520.659
because like

1521.32 --> 1526.8799999999999
it's

1522.919 --> 1529.779
that information was not part

1526.88 --> 1529.779
of the vision

1531.62 --> 1539.1789999999999
and for some create maybe it was pure

1535.22 --> 1542.059
fear maybe I was also like afraid

1539.179 --> 1544.8200000000002
like if I break like if I wouldn't

1542.059 --> 1547.22
submit to Cassandra talking from an

1544.82 --> 1549.1399999999999
extra dimensional perspective that it

1547.22 --> 1550.34
would literally like get me killed or

1549.14 --> 1554.779
something

1550.34 --> 1556.22
so I for some crazy reason I never asked

1554.779 --> 1559.22
for dates

1556.22 --> 1561.98
with anything I saw

1559.22 --> 1564.82
I and I don't know like that could have

1561.98 --> 1564.82
changed everything

1565.4 --> 1570.26
never really asked for a date so I'm

1567.26 --> 1572.419
always just appealing to my intuition to

1570.26 --> 1575.299
figure it out

1572.419 --> 1578.419
when when is that happening when is this

1575.299 --> 1583.4189999999999
happening when is that happening

1578.419 --> 1583.419
Iran China Coast North Korea

1584.72 --> 1589.4
South America stuff

1588.08 --> 1592.3999999999999
like

1589.4 --> 1594.74
and yeah the Canadian stuff but I mean

1592.4 --> 1597.6200000000001
the Canadian stuff is just continual and

1594.74 --> 1599.539
it's been under like there's no re like

1597.62 --> 1601.3999999999999
at best I could have predicted when the

1599.539 --> 1603.8799999999999
starting point of that crazy [ __ ] was

1601.4 --> 1603.88
gonna happen

1604.1 --> 1608.1789999999999
foreign

1605.659 --> 1611.9
which was pretty much like the the

1608.179 --> 1614.3600000000001
medical experimentation

1611.9 --> 1616.8400000000001
and that's when Canada really started to

1614.36 --> 1616.84
go crazy

1617.72 --> 1622.279
by the government well not just the

1620.419 --> 1625.5200000000002
government it's also climate cultists

1622.279 --> 1627.2
recently Lighting on Lightning forests

1625.52 --> 1629.779
on fire and [ __ ]

1627.2 --> 1632.9
that

1629.779 --> 1637.48
I think that the the

1632.9 --> 1637.48
uh the sub no wait uh the

1637.52 --> 1643.82
the emergence

1639.98 --> 1646.22
of the of like actual climate cultists

1643.82 --> 1649.3999999999999
that will set things on fire for their

1646.22 --> 1652.039
agenda climate cultist marxists

1649.4 --> 1653.3200000000002
the re-emergence of that is very

1652.039 --> 1661.24
important

1653.32 --> 1661.24
because they do so much damage people

1661.279 --> 1667.34
yeah they are part of the reason why I

1664.7 --> 1669.32
say execute all Marxist revolutionaries

1667.34 --> 1672.559
hashtag

1669.32 --> 1675.4399999999998
in standard

1672.559 --> 1678.559
it's because of those people because

1675.44 --> 1680.779
they are gun they will just destroy the

1678.559 --> 1683.059
world and they'll just be too stupid to

1680.779 --> 1685.46
realize what that means

1683.059 --> 1688.039
and you all let them do it and you'll be

1685.46 --> 1690.2
like oh they're so stupid no these are

1688.039 --> 1691.8799999999999
[ __ ] demon-possessed scumbags and

1690.2 --> 1694.3400000000001
they should be

1691.88 --> 1697.8400000000001
in jail at least

1694.34 --> 1697.84
and like not let out

1708.44 --> 1711.799
and you don't even want to know what

1710.48 --> 1714.98
they did

1711.799 --> 1717.22
before just the the lighting things on

1714.98 --> 1717.22
fire

1717.44 --> 1723.74
a lot of marxist cultists

1720.679 --> 1726.799
from what I witnessed have to do a lot

1723.74 --> 1729.46
of really [ __ ] up things

1726.799 --> 1729.46
okay

1738.679 --> 1742.76
like

1739.76 --> 1745.72
these people might be crazy but they're

1742.76 --> 1745.72
not playing around

1748.12 --> 1754.059
marxists Mark says that they're deep

1751.46 --> 1756.8600000000001
into it that are cultists about it

1754.059 --> 1758.96
they see

1756.86 --> 1762.86
everybody

1758.96 --> 1765.26
that has any sense of nationality as

1762.86 --> 1769.58
their enemy

1765.26 --> 1773.14
as in enemy combatant that needs to be

1769.58 --> 1773.1399999999999
disabled or killed

1773.84 --> 1778.1
yeah

1775.64 --> 1779.3600000000001
oh it's an exaggeration no it's not an

1778.1 --> 1783.4499999999998
exaggeration

1779.36 --> 1786.6299999999999
it isn't trust me on this it is not

1783.45 --> 1786.63
[Music]

1791.179 --> 1796.88
so

1792.62 --> 1799.1
consider this painful weighing procedure

1796.88 --> 1801.44
yeah

1799.1 --> 1803.7199999999998
now let me be clear I will tolerate

1801.44 --> 1808.0
neither but if I'd have a kid

1803.72 --> 1812.1200000000001
I'd rather it become a full transitional

1808.0 --> 1816.279
transsexual than to become a Marxist

1812.12 --> 1816.279
climate cultist activist

1819.679 --> 1824.299
yeah

1821.179 --> 1827.6000000000001
just to be clear about that

1824.299 --> 1831.74
I'd rather have a [ __ ] kid

1827.6 --> 1835.58
then it becoming a active

1831.74 --> 1837.799
climate cultist Marxist figure that's

1835.58 --> 1839.559
literally gonna burn down things

1837.799 --> 1842.779
and be part of

1839.559 --> 1845.96
antifa riots [ __ ]

1842.779 --> 1848.179
because not all trans people are like

1845.96 --> 1851.539
that at all by the way right they're not

1848.179 --> 1854.299
like intricately linked it's it's rather

1851.539 --> 1857.12
the marxists stimulate that because they

1854.299 --> 1858.44
know that that destroys a country so

1857.12 --> 1862.039
therefore

1858.44 --> 1864.8600000000001
all that [ __ ] because they know it

1862.039 --> 1867.76
it basically victimizes those people

1864.86 --> 1867.76
that undergo it

1869.2 --> 1872.8600000000001
they're evil

1872.899 --> 1877.76
they're not all poor poor boy poor girl

1876.32 --> 1882.039
they don't know any better they're just

1877.76 --> 1882.039
stupid no they're evil

1883.399 --> 1887.02
and they know it

1891.5 --> 1894.82
yeah right

1901.24 --> 1907.34
seven years live perfectly yeah Dr I

1904.94 --> 1909.5
mean we don't necessarily you guys are

1907.34 --> 1911.72
getting it I'm not even gonna get into

1909.5 --> 1915.32
it like this stupid climate predictions

1911.72 --> 1917.48
I mean overpopulation concerns and

1915.32 --> 1921.1399999999999
climate disaster have been

1917.48 --> 1924.44
predicted publicly since

1921.14 --> 1927.679
far into the 19th century like

1924.44 --> 1929.24
and they were always like monumentally

1927.679 --> 1932.1200000000001
wrong

1929.24 --> 1933.46
like every time like not just a little

1932.12 --> 1936.7399999999998
off like

1933.46 --> 1940.0
monumentally wrong every [ __ ] time

1936.74 --> 1940.0
every time

1942.38 --> 1945.64
hey City Star water

1945.679 --> 1949.72
rainbows prove a dumb no

1952.76 --> 1958.34
my rainbows prove that

1956.0 --> 1962.179
there's a non-local hologram that's

1958.34 --> 1963.9189999999999
basically causing the rainbow to be a

1962.179 --> 1967.52
non-local hologram

1963.919 --> 1969.6200000000001
so from my perspective rainbows prove

1967.52 --> 1972.1589999999999
that the celestials are non-local

1969.62 --> 1972.1589999999999
Holograms

1972.5 --> 1980.2
rainbow doesn't look the same when you

1974.779 --> 1980.2
make it with man-made lamps now does it

1986.179 --> 1992.0
no you

1988.279 --> 1993.74
you dare need glass to produce a rainbow

1992.0 --> 1996.019
you need

1993.74 --> 1998.6
colloidal suspended

1996.019 --> 2001.179
water droplets

1998.6 --> 2002.9189999999999
or bigger water droplets would yeah

2001.179 --> 2005.3200000000002
basically rain

2002.919 --> 2008.3400000000001
you need water droplets at a consistent

2005.32 --> 2011.1399999999999
pattern and that will literally

2008.34 --> 2015.58
prismatically break

2011.14 --> 2018.0590000000002
the non-local holographic sunlight

2015.58 --> 2018.059
oh

2032.2 --> 2037.1200000000001
that's right garden hose but you still

2034.6 --> 2040.0
need the sun because if you're going to

2037.12 --> 2042.6399999999999
try to create a rainbow

2040.0 --> 2045.1
with a man-made lamp of some kind it's

2042.64 --> 2049.48
not gonna be the same type of effect

2045.1 --> 2053.139
it's not gonna give you the weird 3D eye

2049.48 --> 2056.679
muscle wobbly effect like it's not gonna

2053.139 --> 2059.379
look that weird non-local like

2056.679 --> 2061.419
right that only works because of the sun

2059.379 --> 2064.0
if you take a rainbow you make a rainbow

2061.419 --> 2065.919
through some heavy lamps

2064.0 --> 2067.839
yeah it's still you're still gonna see

2065.919 --> 2070.06
the color patterns

2067.839 --> 2072.52
but it's not gonna look like an actual

2070.06 --> 2075.2799999999997
sun-based rainbow

2072.52 --> 2076.96
it it won't have that bright Prismatic

2075.28 --> 2078.2200000000003
quality to it

2076.96 --> 2080.26
really

2078.22 --> 2081.8199999999997
have you ever tried it

2080.26 --> 2085.78
it's different

2081.82 --> 2091.26
rainbows from Suns look different

2085.78 --> 2091.26
compared to rainbows from man-made lamps

2091.839 --> 2096.2999999999997
I paid attention to that stuff anyway

2097.38 --> 2103.54
I got some non-recular non-snotty really

2101.44 --> 2106.7400000000002
nice

2103.54 --> 2106.74
Green Leaf stuff

2108.28 --> 2111.599
doing some good

2112.18 --> 2116.5
also got my last bonus Gusto drink don't

2114.94 --> 2118.359
know if I'm gonna get it but with the

2116.5 --> 2120.04
temperature and all the thought

2118.359 --> 2122.2
why not

2120.04 --> 2124.839
it didn't burn my shoulder and maybe if

2122.2 --> 2128.56
it does then I will take that note

2124.839 --> 2130.66
as a note that yes this is a direct bad

2128.56 --> 2134.94
influence on my shoulder

2130.66 --> 2134.94
even with vitamin C anyway cheers

2151.14 --> 2154.5
okay wait wait

2157.53 --> 2164.52
[Music]

2162.04 --> 2169.689
ah

2164.52 --> 2169.689
[Music]

2172.49 --> 2175.7299999999996
[Music]

2200.74 --> 2205.18
yeah I was actually kind of hungry

2202.92 --> 2208.8
because again

2205.18 --> 2208.7999999999997
yes yesterday

2209.5 --> 2214.72
I basically

2211.9 --> 2216.94
ate an Illuminati consomme

2214.72 --> 2219.7599999999998
baked eggs

2216.94 --> 2222.579
and some chicken soup with extra spices

2219.76 --> 2224.5600000000004
that's it

2222.579 --> 2226.8590000000004
there's not a lot of food for an entire

2224.56 --> 2226.859
day

2234.04 --> 2238.119
I think I also had some chocolate

2235.54 --> 2239.74
cookies because there was like a bonus

2238.119 --> 2242.6800000000003
packet

2239.74 --> 2244.72
from the hijo Plaza

2242.68 --> 2245.74
and it had like chocolate cookies in

2244.72 --> 2250.6189999999997
there

2245.74 --> 2250.6189999999997
organic so they were nice

2252.22 --> 2257.2
I'm not used to it anymore though but I

2255.099 --> 2259.3590000000004
didn't get any bad reactions from it but

2257.2 --> 2263.2
it was like whoa

2259.359 --> 2266.7
chocolate what cookies what

2263.2 --> 2266.7
I'm not used to that sugar

2268.359 --> 2274.74
so I actually did get a bit of a sugar

2271.0 --> 2274.74
high from the chocolate cookies

2274.9 --> 2279.2400000000002
I just never eat cookies I never do

2279.94 --> 2282.94
foreign

2282.99 --> 2286.08
[Music]

2288.28 --> 2292.2400000000002
you can't make homemade rainbow without

2291.16 --> 2294.839
glass

2292.24 --> 2294.839
okay

2308.02 --> 2314.619
well that if you're saying that when you

2311.2 --> 2317.859
use a man-made lamp

2314.619 --> 2321.76
you can't make a rainbow with that

2317.859 --> 2324.8199999999997
even when you do shine it right through

2321.76 --> 2326.92
a garden hose spraying

2324.82 --> 2328.78
like mist

2326.92 --> 2332.4
well

2328.78 --> 2337.0600000000004
then that simply proves that

2332.4 --> 2339.4
rainbows can't actually be made

2337.06 --> 2342.54
by regular lamps

2339.4 --> 2342.54
why would that be

2343.42 --> 2348.7000000000003
could it be because the man-made light

2346.06 --> 2352.14
source is not not a non-local hologram

2348.7 --> 2352.14
could that be the reason

2353.44 --> 2357.06
so it just doesn't work

2358.9 --> 2363.599
bubbles rainbows yeah but that's

2360.579 --> 2363.599
different that's uh

2364.72 --> 2372.22
that's oil-based color breaking turret

2368.74 --> 2373.24
it's like oil my oil stains like on the

2372.22 --> 2376.56
road

2373.24 --> 2376.56
I'd have all those colors

2381.64 --> 2389.5789999999997
there's like other things that break

2384.339 --> 2389.5789999999997
light too and like giving colors

2400.359 --> 2406.02
if there's a dome outside oh my God what

2403.66 --> 2406.02
is this

2412.0 --> 2416.579
I don't know but it is an effect of a

2414.339 --> 2416.5789999999997
dome

2417.579 --> 2423.099
it's an effect of the Sun

2420.88 --> 2426.88
you already literally

2423.099 --> 2428.619
explain that you do it at home it

2426.88 --> 2431.2000000000003
doesn't work with water droplets you

2428.619 --> 2434.26
have to use glass

2431.2 --> 2436.96
so it doesn't work then because guess

2434.26 --> 2440.44
what a rainbow is formed not because

2436.96 --> 2443.7400000000002
suddenly a piece of glass

2440.44 --> 2445.96
is brought out to create that no it's

2443.74 --> 2449.6189999999997
water droplets

2445.96 --> 2453.28
water droplets outside when the sun is

2449.619 --> 2456.359
out creates a rainbow not a piece of

2453.28 --> 2456.3590000000004
glass that's brought out

2461.14 --> 2466.2999999999997
if you're just going to assume glass is

2463.78 --> 2468.46
causing it well then you're gonna assume

2466.3 --> 2470.6800000000003
a gigantic amount about the entire

2468.46 --> 2474.099
scenario that's taking place

2470.68 --> 2478.56
mainly that the sun is behind this

2474.099 --> 2478.56
presumed glass you think is causing it

2480.099 --> 2483.599
they're just presupposing that

2503.5 --> 2505.8
foreign

2511.48 --> 2515.04
that's hilarious Terry

2517.48 --> 2523.44
yes turret there is construction work

2520.42 --> 2523.44
happening out there

2556.42 --> 2562.599
you can't create Horizons at home

2560.56 --> 2565.42
I'm gonna have Horizons just an apparent

2562.599 --> 2568.44
effect Dr hooker you can actually create

2565.42 --> 2568.44
a horizon at home

2570.04 --> 2575.5
just take the camera and put it very low

2573.7 --> 2576.64
to the ground

2575.5 --> 2578.98
foreign

2576.64 --> 2581.859
and then look out horizontally you're

2578.98 --> 2586.359
gonna have things

2581.859 --> 2588.94
seeming to disappear below the horizon

2586.359 --> 2591.46
even though it's measurably

2588.94 --> 2592.839
moving into a distance at a straight as

2591.46 --> 2595.26
a straight

2592.839 --> 2595.2599999999998
line

2602.74 --> 2605.859
you can actually create a horizon at

2605.02 --> 2608.74
home

2605.859 --> 2609.88
you can create a horizon over a flat

2608.74 --> 2612.7799999999997
plane

2609.88 --> 2612.78
huh

2623.7 --> 2629.64
birth son is dude you you haven't been

2627.22 --> 2629.64
listening

2629.859 --> 2633.7599999999998
did you miss the part about the

2631.78 --> 2637.5400000000004
non-local hologram

2633.76 --> 2639.579
yeah the sun isn't anywhere the sun is

2637.54 --> 2641.319
not an object you can't actually

2639.579 --> 2646.44
pinpoint

2641.319 --> 2646.44
where the sun literally physically is

2646.48 --> 2651.819
it isn't anywhere it's a non-local

2649.359 --> 2655.0789999999997
hologram it's arguably not even an

2651.819 --> 2655.079
object it's just an effect

2670.32 --> 2674.119
[Music]

2700.26 --> 2705.2400000000002
no doctor was great I don't think

2702.28 --> 2705.2400000000002
they're gonna go that far

2707.02 --> 2712.78
cry instead of the Dome no

2709.96 --> 2715.54
no but here's the thing

2712.78 --> 2716.38
any wise flatter wouldn't be claiming a

2715.54 --> 2717.4
dome

2716.38 --> 2719.98
foreign

2717.4 --> 2722.079
you're going to start making claims of

2719.98 --> 2724.119
literal architecture

2722.079 --> 2726.28
well then that has geometric

2724.119 --> 2729.7200000000003
consequences that has

2726.28 --> 2729.7200000000003
a burden of proof

2732.22 --> 2739.359
now when you think of Flat Earth

2735.52 --> 2742.24
you can have a personal preference of

2739.359 --> 2744.46
thinking about it including a dome

2742.24 --> 2748.24
you're like I like that

2744.46 --> 2750.099
that's a an easy way for me to think

2748.24 --> 2753.16
about flatter so that's what I'm gonna

2750.099 --> 2754.7200000000003
do well then you just like the idea of a

2753.16 --> 2759.04
dome

2754.72 --> 2761.2
there is no proof of it none

2759.04 --> 2763.599
where's the barrier

2761.2 --> 2766.9199999999996
where is it

2763.599 --> 2766.92
is there a barrier

2768.099 --> 2774.2200000000003
if there's no barrier there's no Dome

2771.4 --> 2777.099
yeah a dome has a very pronounced

2774.22 --> 2781.5989999999997
geometric consequences mainly that you

2777.099 --> 2784.6600000000003
are surrounded by a raw by a wall

2781.599 --> 2786.46
that's a dough yeah Dome touch is down

2784.66 --> 2789.7
around you

2786.46 --> 2791.8
so where is that it's not anywhere

2789.7 --> 2793.06
there's no proof that it is there

2791.8 --> 2797.6400000000003
there's

2793.06 --> 2797.64
what you think that in 200 years

2797.92 --> 2804.04
nobody ever made a photograph of it

2802.24 --> 2807.52
nobody ever thought of like yeah let's

2804.04 --> 2809.14
get the the real real serious proof for

2807.52 --> 2810.28
this

2809.14 --> 2812.56
no

2810.28 --> 2814.42
there is no such photo there are no

2812.56 --> 2816.16
photos of the Dome if there were they

2814.42 --> 2818.579
would have leaked

2816.16 --> 2822.04
there aren't any

2818.579 --> 2826.44
there aren't any

2822.04 --> 2826.44
which means no Dome

2827.079 --> 2834.04
yeah now there's containment for sure

2831.52 --> 2835.0
and so I speculate there might be a flat

2834.04 --> 2837.46
top

2835.0 --> 2839.76
that's a more logical architecturally

2837.46 --> 2843.04
logical decision

2839.76 --> 2845.5600000000004
considering the elements that we have to

2843.04 --> 2846.819
reconcile with mainly that there is no

2845.56 --> 2850.7799999999997
barrier

2846.819 --> 2853.74
to be a architectural resting point for

2850.78 --> 2853.7400000000002
a dome structure

2855.76 --> 2861.3390000000004
with which leads to more Mysteries right

2858.339 --> 2863.02
I mean like how big is the realm is

2861.339 --> 2865.24
there a loop

2863.02 --> 2867.96
there's a loop there's definitely not

2865.24 --> 2867.9599999999996
going to be a dome

2868.119 --> 2872.6800000000003
although there can be still a tunnel

2870.099 --> 2875.8590000000004
Dome if there is a singular Loop like a

2872.68 --> 2877.96
loop in One Direction but if there's

2875.859 --> 2880.66
more

2877.96 --> 2883.3
spatial non-linear traits North and

2880.66 --> 2885.46
South say well yeah then there's just

2883.3 --> 2888.96
not gonna be any kind of Dome there

2885.46 --> 2888.96
there will be a flat top then

2889.0 --> 2894.04
right so if it's just looping east to

2891.099 --> 2894.5800000000004
west then a dome structure can be like a

2894.04 --> 2895.7799999999997
tunnel

2894.58 --> 2898.0
[Music]

2895.78 --> 2900.46
potentially they're still gonna have to

2898.0 --> 2902.619
be two distinct barriers that you're

2900.46 --> 2904.119
gonna have to be able to run into to

2902.619 --> 2907.92
prove that

2904.119 --> 2907.92
if there's no such barriers

2908.02 --> 2916.02
then it must

2910.839 --> 2916.02
logically be a flat top

2922.74 --> 2928.24
right so that's how this works

2926.319 --> 2932.7
thought about it very carefully it's

2928.24 --> 2932.7
part of the thing that I do here

2933.16 --> 2939.16
yeah that's called figuring out what

2935.74 --> 2940.54
could be based on what we know and what

2939.16 --> 2942.7799999999997
we don't know

2940.54 --> 2942.7799999999997
foreign

2968.339 --> 2973.54
okay Richard G that's cute sounds like

2971.619 --> 2976.1400000000003
that Flat Earth is talking a lot of

2973.54 --> 2976.14
horror [ __ ]

2978.76 --> 2985.2000000000003
you can use a sexton to determine it's

2981.64 --> 2985.2
local no you can't

2988.3 --> 2994.0600000000004
it's horseshit you can't determine

2990.28 --> 2998.8
anything about the exact position of the

2994.06 --> 3001.38
sun like in any way can you ever exactly

2998.8 --> 3003.9
position anything about the sun you just

3001.38 --> 3007.7400000000002
got an angle that's the only thing

3003.9 --> 3009.1800000000003
anybody has ever gotten about it

3007.74 --> 3012.359
beside

3009.18 --> 3013.859
measuring its output or presumed to be

3012.359 --> 3016.14
output

3013.859 --> 3017.7599999999998
the light arriving you can measure the

3016.14 --> 3020.819
light arriving and you can measure the

3017.76 --> 3024.0600000000004
angle that's it that's all you got

3020.819 --> 3026.099
that's all anybody has ever gotten there

3024.06 --> 3027.599
is no more information about it than

3026.099 --> 3030.96
that

3027.599 --> 3032.7000000000003
yeah and if anybody says that they're

3030.96 --> 3035.7200000000003
just bluffing or they don't know what

3032.7 --> 3035.72
the [ __ ] they're talking about

3036.72 --> 3042.54
or they're appealing to some stupid

3038.96 --> 3045.599
triangulation processes like oh whoa

3042.54 --> 3049.2
uh the angles prove it would have to be

3045.599 --> 3051.059
over here over a flat disc yeah yeah we

3049.2 --> 3054.18
know how that works that brings up

3051.059 --> 3056.52
position yeah it isn't there yeah

3054.18 --> 3057.8999999999996
you go there you move there oh guess

3056.52 --> 3061.2599999999998
what yeah no

3057.9 --> 3064.7400000000002
no angular size increase as you approach

3061.26 --> 3067.079
the presumed location of the sun based

3064.74 --> 3070.3799999999997
on your triangulation with your disc

3067.079 --> 3073.8
presupposition yeah it's not there the

3070.38 --> 3078.6600000000003
sun isn't an object that has a literal

3073.8 --> 3080.94
location it isn't that there is no

3078.66 --> 3083.52
approach of it

3080.94 --> 3086.04
there is no angular size increase it's

3083.52 --> 3089.64
not an object in a location it's only

3086.04 --> 3093.24
ever at an angle in relation to the

3089.64 --> 3097.68
Observer that's what the sun is it's at

3093.24 --> 3100.68
an angle in relation to the Observer

3097.68 --> 3100.68
foreign

3110.48 --> 3114.619
get the [ __ ] up [ __ ]

3115.38 --> 3119.2400000000002
blab her mouth and retards

3120.3 --> 3126.2400000000002
that we don't need more [ __ ] talking

3122.819 --> 3128.22
flat earthers yep just because Flat

3126.24 --> 3132.359
Earth argumentation

3128.22 --> 3136.2599999999998
has absolutely crushed the globe Cosmo

3132.359 --> 3140.0989999999997
cosmology yeah does it mean oh yes oh

3136.26 --> 3141.96
now please blabbermouth [ __ ] flat

3140.099 --> 3144.619
earthers please get on the scene and

3141.96 --> 3150.18
make up [ __ ] stories about flatter

3144.619 --> 3152.52
please do that no no please don't do

3150.18 --> 3154.7999999999997
that it sucks

3152.52 --> 3158.339
you're just spreading more of a rumor

3154.8 --> 3161.04
[ __ ] stop doing that

3158.339 --> 3162.7799999999997
yeah you're not proving your [ __ ]

3161.04 --> 3164.16
Dome

3162.78 --> 3166.8
yeah

3164.16 --> 3169.3799999999997
nobody's proven a dome you're not

3166.8 --> 3171.78
proving it up nobody is proving a dome

3169.38 --> 3173.94
you don't have proof of a dome there is

3171.78 --> 3175.44
no proof of a dome

3173.94 --> 3177.44
yeah

3175.44 --> 3182.88
there's not even a

3177.44 --> 3186.119
mechanical necessity for a dome

3182.88 --> 3189.48
only thing that is required is a

3186.119 --> 3193.44
limitation of volume in order for the

3189.48 --> 3196.559
gas present within the Realms confines

3193.44 --> 3199.339
to be able to pressurize

3196.559 --> 3202.3190000000004
yeah a limitation to the volume

3199.339 --> 3206.4
containment yeah there's no Dome

3202.319 --> 3209.16
required simply a limitation to the

3206.4 --> 3213.48
volume in which the gas can expand into

3209.16 --> 3218.0
yeah that's what's required not a dome

3213.48 --> 3218.0
stop fooling people with [ __ ]

3231.96 --> 3237.0
yeah

3233.46 --> 3241.44
you want to prove a freaking Dome cool

3237.0 --> 3246.48
proof that the equator

3241.44 --> 3247.68
is a euclidean circle over the flatterer

3246.48 --> 3250.619
proven

3247.68 --> 3253.68
yeah prove it

3250.619 --> 3258.559
and by the way that technically doesn't

3253.68 --> 3262.2599999999998
even prove it it just begins to hint

3258.559 --> 3264.1800000000003
towards a proof of a slight possibility

3262.26 --> 3266.7000000000003
that there might be a dumb structure

3264.18 --> 3270.66
yeah that's what that does

3266.7 --> 3275.04
doesn't prove it but you'd absolutely

3270.66 --> 3278.46
require the equator to be a euclidean

3275.04 --> 3281.7
circle over the Flat Earth

3278.46 --> 3284.76
yeah or Cartesian Circle over the

3281.7 --> 3288.7999999999997
flatter you it would be required to be

3284.76 --> 3291.0
that in order to begin

3288.8 --> 3293.579
suggesting that there might be a dough

3291.0 --> 3295.26
logically yeah

3293.579 --> 3301.44
start with that

3295.26 --> 3305.94
yeah because if the equator is not a a

3301.44 --> 3312.48
dead-on circle a perfect circle

3305.94 --> 3314.16
on Flat Earth then there is no Dome

3312.48 --> 3317.339
doesn't matter like oh we could do this

3314.16 --> 3321.48
no no no if it's not a perfect circle

3317.339 --> 3323.94
there is no Dome

3321.48 --> 3327.48
finished

3323.94 --> 3329.819
do you understand maybe you don't I do

3327.48 --> 3332.28
because I know about this stuff this is

3329.819 --> 3336.24
my profession this is what I've wasted

3332.28 --> 3339.3590000000004
all those years on specializing it yeah

3336.24 --> 3341.8799999999997
on understanding this

3339.359 --> 3343.92
what can be possible how does that work

3341.88 --> 3347.099
how does that mechanically interconnect

3343.92 --> 3348.8
with all the other potential

3347.099 --> 3353.54
possibilities

3348.8 --> 3353.54
conditional potential possibilities

3355.079 --> 3361.98
yeah

3357.24 --> 3364.8799999999997
the Dome is not a high percentage

3361.98 --> 3364.88
likelihood

3365.339 --> 3372.72
however it is a mental

3369.859 --> 3375.42
likelihood that you'll

3372.72 --> 3377.9399999999996
start thinking about it in your mind

3375.42 --> 3380.339
like that in that sense it is a very

3377.94 --> 3383.04
high percentage likelihood that you'll

3380.339 --> 3384.18
be thinking about a dome in relation to

3383.04 --> 3388.94
Flat Earth

3384.18 --> 3388.94
but the actual physical reality

3389.16 --> 3394.68
will reveal that the likelihood of an

3392.28 --> 3397.6400000000003
actual physical Dome being there is

3394.68 --> 3397.64
extremely low

3398.94 --> 3401.119
foreign

3402.5 --> 3408.5
ER is a circle

3405.48 --> 3408.5
I don't think so

3414.42 --> 3420.96
we're not claim I'm not I'm just

3417.3 --> 3425.52
talking in general truth listener

3420.96 --> 3428.9
you brought it up so I addressed it

3425.52 --> 3428.9
doesn't matter what you believe

3429.3 --> 3433.4
in that

3430.619 --> 3433.4
regard

3435.78 --> 3438.78
foreign

3442.099 --> 3445.52
yeah they don't

3451.02 --> 3456.599
I mean

3452.579 --> 3459.3
like lattice proves unicorns

3456.599 --> 3461.819
right I mean if there wasn't a unicorn

3459.3 --> 3464.76
then why would there be lattice

3461.819 --> 3467.4
when of course a unicorn looks upon this

3464.76 --> 3470.78
and immediately wants to eat it

3467.4 --> 3474.3
so because lattice exists

3470.78 --> 3476.579
unicorns must therefore also exist

3474.3 --> 3479.42
yeah that's that's that level of

3476.579 --> 3479.42
argumentation

3490.4 --> 3495.8
A1 VidCon

3493.079 --> 3495.8
by the way

3498.18 --> 3501.319
house Liquor's mind

3511.099 --> 3514.98
right anyway I hope you guys are

3513.359 --> 3517.339
enjoying the show I've been going for a

3514.98 --> 3517.339
while already

3517.619 --> 3522.059
I'm having fun and the weather's just

3520.02 --> 3524.96
great and it makes me feel great and I

3522.059 --> 3524.96
feel strong and

3529.5 --> 3534.559
I hope everybody's doing all right

3532.079 --> 3534.559
cheers

3543.9 --> 3548.819
okay

3545.7 --> 3550.68
Owens Benjamin yesterday was

3548.819 --> 3553.98
meh

3550.68 --> 3555.839
it was like literally really complaining

3553.98 --> 3559.02
about this guy

3555.839 --> 3563.099
that I barely even know and he says that

3559.02 --> 3566.7599999999998
like wait you befriended that

3563.099 --> 3570.5
I had to like Google a picture

3566.76 --> 3570.5
he never even showed it once

3571.619 --> 3577.079
but yeah that

3574.559 --> 3580.559
not super riveting to me

3577.079 --> 3582.98
it's like yeah guys obviously a deranged

3580.559 --> 3582.98
[ __ ]

3583.2 --> 3588.54
where the hell did you ever think you

3584.819 --> 3588.54
could befriend him no

3588.839 --> 3591.38
whatever

3607.559 --> 3611.96
Sam Hyde

3609.42 --> 3611.96
yeah

3615.299 --> 3619.2599999999998
but I don't understand why Owen thought

3617.88 --> 3621.78
that

3619.26 --> 3624.38
he actually said that no he was kind of

3621.78 --> 3624.38
a cool guy

3625.38 --> 3627.799
okay

3663.92 --> 3670.76
but slow my moon but how is his genocido

3667.2 --> 3670.7599999999998
by the way I don't know

3674.04 --> 3676.819
is he like

3677.819 --> 3683.54
super pro population control genocidal

3680.819 --> 3683.54
or something or

3691.38 --> 3697.799
does he just hate all humans

3694.799 --> 3697.799
covered

3701.339 --> 3706.5589999999997
super approach that's not clear what

3703.98 --> 3709.64
you're meaning genocidal it literally

3706.559 --> 3709.6400000000003
can mean anything

3710.4 --> 3717.0
how what what's his Target what does he

3714.359 --> 3719.22
hate so much or is he just like I hate

3717.0 --> 3722.96
all of humanity is he just a bitter

3719.22 --> 3722.9599999999996
fruit that just hates everything

3743.28 --> 3747.6600000000003
and you look figuring no

3748.02 --> 3750.5
oh

3752.04 --> 3754.88
not really

3769.02 --> 3775.14
yeah I watch makers like not really the

3771.66 --> 3778.68
time to bring that up anyway

3775.14 --> 3781.02
I to be fair I would really prefer it if

3778.68 --> 3783.72
nobody would ask me that kind of

3781.02 --> 3786.24
questions like don't

3783.72 --> 3787.799
if I want to talk about that I'll bring

3786.24 --> 3792.4199999999996
it up

3787.799 --> 3795.48
because it's very distracting to me to

3792.42 --> 3798.54
bring that up because it's personal

3795.48 --> 3802.88
you you get that right watchmaker we're

3798.54 --> 3802.88
talking about something else right now

3808.619 --> 3814.2200000000003
and cute girls yeah

3811.26 --> 3814.2200000000003
no they're okay

3815.28 --> 3820.799
I do have suspicions of vaccination

3817.92 --> 3821.7000000000003
damage though and that for me is really

3820.799 --> 3823.619
it

3821.7 --> 3826.2799999999997
a very

3823.619 --> 3826.28
tough one

3829.38 --> 3833.1600000000003
and there's one girl that I actually do

3831.78 --> 3836.46
kind of like

3833.16 --> 3839.7599999999998
but I fear that she's also faxed

3836.46 --> 3842.599
and like yeah that's that's that's too

3839.76 --> 3842.599
bad then

3847.74 --> 3851.9399999999996
but I'd have to actually ask and it's

3850.619 --> 3854.94
like I

3851.94 --> 3857.839
I don't want to ask because then I'll

3854.94 --> 3857.839
find out

3877.5 --> 3882.02
sorry if you were being annoying no

3882.119 --> 3887.6400000000003
it's fine

3884.48 --> 3890.46
you you brought up somebody

3887.64 --> 3893.46
that apparently claims that he proves a

3890.46 --> 3895.14
dome because of a rainbow

3893.46 --> 3897.119
um

3895.14 --> 3898.2599999999998
I personally think that's just really

3897.119 --> 3903.619
stupid

3898.26 --> 3903.619
not you but the guy making that claim

3903.66 --> 3912.98
and it's a little silly of you to say

3906.9 --> 3912.98
the least Echo that claim when obviously

3913.02 --> 3918.24
it's horseshit

3915.119 --> 3919.92
and you should know that

3918.24 --> 3922.2799999999997
if you've been following Flat Earth

3919.92 --> 3922.28
debates

3928.98 --> 3932.64
but it's not like you were gamma

3930.66 --> 3936.0789999999997
spazzing out in chat or anything truth

3932.64 --> 3936.0789999999997
listener so don't worry about it

3936.359 --> 3938.48
um

3944.46 --> 3951.14
is yeah it is a deal breaker absolutely

3962.23 --> 3965.369
[Music]

3970.4 --> 3974.94
I mean this sounds a little radical

3973.619 --> 3977.94
perhaps

3974.94 --> 3982.28
but as far as I'm concerned all people

3977.94 --> 3982.28
that have taken faxes

3982.68 --> 3989.4199999999996
in the last

3984.72 --> 3989.4199999999996
three years they're all dead to me

3989.52 --> 3995.16
they might still be walking around and

3991.74 --> 3998.0989999999997
being there and doing stuff but there's

3995.16 --> 4000.2799999999997
literally nothing that I can do with

3998.099 --> 4000.28
them

4000.93 --> 4004.06
[Music]

4015.16 --> 4020.5589999999997
yeah well then don't bring it up then

4017.599 --> 4020.559
dick

4024.079 --> 4027.38
or careful you might give you straight

4025.76 --> 4029.9
yeah well you [ __ ] brought it up

4027.38 --> 4032.26
[ __ ] why the [ __ ] did you bring it

4029.9 --> 4032.26
up then

4047.72 --> 4049.72
um

4050.299 --> 4054.859
like why the [ __ ] would I even get that

4053.24 --> 4057.6189999999997
it's like no

4054.859 --> 4061.2799999999997
I'm not accepting it I don't accept

4057.619 --> 4063.2000000000003
people that accept it uh

4061.28 --> 4066.559
what the hell are you talking about how

4063.2 --> 4071.02
should I get a strike for that

4066.559 --> 4071.02
I'm not even addressing anything medical

4071.24 --> 4076.8999999999996
just talking about my own personal views

4074.059 --> 4076.9
and preferences

4079.22 --> 4085.5389999999998
radical it's Common Sense yeah well

4081.38 --> 4085.539
radical common sense is radical

4085.64 --> 4088.9
in this freaking world

4095.96 --> 4100.42
Jackson says no no

4107.179 --> 4111.04
you don't really need to do that

4125.12 --> 4131.12
besides I mean there's not really a

4128.299 --> 4134.0199999999995
point there's only a real point

4131.12 --> 4134.0199999999995
to like

4135.199 --> 4140.12
getting official with vaccination status

4137.719 --> 4142.64
and all that after the medical

4140.12 --> 4147.259
industrial complex criminals that have

4142.64 --> 4150.259
created this gigantic worldwide genocide

4147.259 --> 4154.46
so they've all been put behind bars like

4150.259 --> 4156.98
when it's been made illegal

4154.46 --> 4161.2390000000005
yeah

4156.98 --> 4163.94
when it's just default made illegal like

4161.239 --> 4167.178999999999
that crap that they do

4163.94 --> 4169.5199999999995
made illegal like you're not allowed to

4167.179 --> 4171.58
ever do that again like it's completely

4169.52 --> 4176.38
forbidden

4171.58 --> 4176.38
disassemble your Laboratories right now

4177.199 --> 4183.919999999999
if you don't you get like prison time

4179.92 --> 4183.92
immediately right

4184.04 --> 4189.38
unless that happens there's no point

4186.62 --> 4191.54
like because if anybody's gonna be like

4189.38 --> 4193.279
Oh I'm super effective well that you're

4191.54 --> 4196.54
gonna be

4193.279 --> 4196.540000000001
[ __ ] around with

4200.84 --> 4203.900000000001
and

4201.92 --> 4206.0
yeah there's going to be people that are

4203.9 --> 4208.46
facts that are like gonna try to hide it

4206.0 --> 4210.08
because they know they screwed up

4208.46 --> 4212.38
and they still want to be part of

4210.08 --> 4212.38
everything

4231.98 --> 4236.739
so I don't know

4233.92 --> 4239.42
it's

4236.739 --> 4242.239
don't worry about it like whatever

4239.42 --> 4244.4
happens happens out there and

4242.239 --> 4247.099999999999
hey if they're all [ __ ] stupid enough

4244.4 --> 4249.86
to have fallen for that [ __ ] if none of

4247.1 --> 4251.9800000000005
them can resist any level of peer

4249.86 --> 4251.98
pressure

4252.26 --> 4257.780000000001
any logical thinking critical thinking

4255.08 --> 4259.76
responsibility in the face of like dire

4257.78 --> 4261.739
situations with the way if none of them

4259.76 --> 4264.56
can handle that well then none of them

4261.739 --> 4267.099999999999
are worthy then

4264.56 --> 4270.38
none of them are worthy or probably

4267.1 --> 4273.64
capable enough to even raise a child

4270.38 --> 4276.679
that was conceived with me

4273.64 --> 4280.46
if you can't have like dude I'm gonna be

4276.679 --> 4284.02
expecting some really serious resistance

4280.46 --> 4284.02
against the world for my life

4286.1 --> 4293.179
I mean I'm looking for a Santa car Sarah

4289.159 --> 4297.259999999999
Connor almost it's a bit Overkill but it

4293.179 --> 4300.32
is like I need somebody that's like yes

4297.26 --> 4304.159000000001
we are at war with the world like I need

4300.32 --> 4309.199
to protect my child like militantly yeah

4304.159 --> 4312.0199999999995
that's what I'm looking for

4309.199 --> 4314.839999999999
somebody that's actually serious about

4312.02 --> 4316.88
that and not just like oh yeah yeah oh

4314.84 --> 4319.1
you're so cool yeah oh you're such a man

4316.88 --> 4321.08
and that'll just like behind my back do

4319.1 --> 4324.1990000000005
all that [ __ ] anyway

4321.08 --> 4327.5
right yeah because there's crap like

4324.199 --> 4330.0199999999995
that out there I don't want that

4327.5 --> 4334.3
at all

4330.02 --> 4334.3
I despise people like that

4343.94 --> 4346.48
oh

4349.84 --> 4354.159000000001
yeah turret yeah yeah yeah

4356.02 --> 4359.129000000001
[Music]

4362.84 --> 4367.64
just trying to yeah don't don't try to

4365.96 --> 4370.04
warn me okay

4367.64 --> 4372.8
true listener I don't need your [ __ ]

4370.04 --> 4376.1
warnings when somebody tries to warn me

4372.8 --> 4378.159000000001
in my chat you know what that usually is

4376.1 --> 4382.46
that's them

4378.159 --> 4384.5599999999995
literally doing that to me

4382.46 --> 4387.14
while there's telling me

4384.56 --> 4389.659000000001
because they're usually really [ __ ] up

4387.14 --> 4391.88
[ __ ]

4389.659 --> 4396.32
it's happened before

4391.88 --> 4399.38
like they would literally fill in the

4396.32 --> 4402.08
form for a strike as they are trying to

4399.38 --> 4404.900000000001
warn me off that in my chat

4402.08 --> 4407.48
because they're sick bastards yeah so

4404.9 --> 4410.299999999999
nobody [ __ ] tell me oh you shouldn't

4407.48 --> 4411.739
talk never bring it up

4410.3 --> 4414.1990000000005
yeah

4411.739 --> 4417.5
never bring it up

4414.199 --> 4420.5
don't tell me what risks a strike or

4417.5 --> 4423.28
anything I I know how to maneuver myself

4420.5 --> 4423.28
around YouTube

4428.3 --> 4431.9800000000005
I know what I can talk about

4432.5 --> 4440.02
a lot of strike nonsense risks have been

4436.34 --> 4440.02
lifted for a while now

4440.6 --> 4447.56
I could even just say the c word Fallout

4443.239 --> 4449.839999999999
without any strike risk okay it is

4447.56 --> 4451.280000000001
technically just safe to talk all that

4449.84 --> 4453.08
hard [ __ ] now

4451.28 --> 4455.659
that people would have their channels

4453.08 --> 4458.96
deleted for two years ago yeah it's

4455.659 --> 4462.62
completely safe now

4458.96 --> 4464.86
I just don't want to [ __ ] do it

4462.62 --> 4464.86
anyway

4466.52 --> 4469.42
all right

4481.1 --> 4486.400000000001
and I'm not gonna get a strike for this

4482.96 --> 4486.4
like why the hell would I

4488.659 --> 4496.5199999999995
I haven't even made any claim

4492.08 --> 4500.3
about what anything medical would do I

4496.52 --> 4504.679
literally have made zero zero percent

4500.3 --> 4507.8
Claim about what it would even do so me

4504.679 --> 4509.9
saying hey I refuse to

4507.8 --> 4512.12
date

4509.9 --> 4515.839999999999
a vaxed person

4512.12 --> 4517.4
that has absolutely nothing to do with

4515.84 --> 4519.38
medical information

4517.4 --> 4522.82
yeah

4519.38 --> 4522.82
nothing to do with it

4523.219 --> 4528.34

4525.26 --> 4528.34
[ __ ] problem dude

[Music]

4581.36 --> 4586.239

4622.34 --> 4630.159000000001
what does that stand for

4625.9 --> 4630.159
n-s-o-a-e I don't know what that means

4648.08 --> 4654.46
whether it be difficult to get gross

4650.36 --> 4654.46
countries in alignment on the V legally

4654.86 --> 4660.62
uh

4656.84 --> 4663.9400000000005
no once it gets going

4660.62 --> 4663.94
the point is is that

4664.88 --> 4670.159000000001
it there's a certain threshold that

4667.58 --> 4672.739
needs to be met and then all all

4670.159 --> 4675.04
countries were all like gladly get rid

4672.739 --> 4675.04
of it

4678.32 --> 4682.699
but you need to get there the The Profit

4680.48 --> 4686.32
needs to be disabled and then everybody

4682.699 --> 4686.32
will gladly get rid of it

4696.08 --> 4700.179

different little YouTube documentaries

4791.96 --> 4798.62
about Eugenics right now because

4794.96 --> 4800.54

4817.88 --> 4821.86
which is very late by the way

4825.199 --> 4829.879999999999
not technically I already knew it like

4827.3 --> 4831.5
in my teens but I didn't really see it

4829.88 --> 4834.1
for what it was

4831.5 --> 4834.1

4847.88 --> 4852.02
it's the new

4849.56 --> 4853.820000000001
La it's the new wave proper New Wave

4852.02 --> 4855.4400000000005
propaganda

4853.82 --> 4858.86
mutton

4855.44 --> 4863.86
all the new generation of sheep like no

4912.44 --> 4918.259999999999
possible viewer gate because I

4915.38 --> 4922.1
everything I stand for is diametrically

4918.26 --> 4925.159000000001
like on the minute level diametrically

4922.1 --> 4927.88
opposed to everything that is propaganda

4925.159 --> 4927.879999999999
[ __ ]

4928.219 --> 4934.4
as in like oh oh this is the supposed

4931.94 --> 4936.199
popular opinion

4934.4 --> 4938.78
oh this is all this new narrative

4936.199 --> 4941.54
Direction like oh okay then I'm going to

4938.78 --> 4943.639999999999
fanatically be the opposite thing not

4941.54 --> 4945.8
necessarily because I really love the

4943.64 --> 4948.08
opposite thing it's just because I hate

4945.8 --> 4951.38
you so [ __ ] much I'll Transform

4948.08 --> 4955.219
myself into the Devil Himself if

4951.38 --> 4958.88
necessary to [ __ ] oppose you yeah

4955.219 --> 4962.14
I am the exact opposite of everything

4958.88 --> 4962.14
that you want

4962.96 --> 4966.62
that you want the [ __ ] world to turn

4965.239 --> 4969.759999999999
into

4966.62 --> 4969.76
that's what I am

4970.28 --> 4975.08
yeah

4971.54 --> 4977.9
I do everything the other way everything

4975.08 --> 4980.96
every [ __ ] opinion every [ __ ]

4977.9 --> 4983.9
subject I'll be exactly the [ __ ]

4980.96 --> 4986.4800000000005
opposite of what you're used to hearing

4983.9 --> 4988.759999999999
blabbermouth idiots that are saying

4986.48 --> 4991.82
anything it just get a little bit more

4988.76 --> 4993.7390000000005
view like oh please Overlord give me a

4991.82 --> 4996.44
little bit more water

4993.739 --> 4998.718999999999
oh I'll say whatever the [ __ ] you want

4996.44 --> 5001.599999999999
I'll have myself [ __ ] in the ass on

4998.719 --> 5004.9
camera if necessary oh just please give

5001.6 --> 5006.9400000000005
me a little bit more viewers yeah [ __ ]

5004.9 --> 5010.9
you

5006.94 --> 5013.9
I'll do my [ __ ] with zero views and I'll

5010.9 --> 5017.739
still do it I'll still do it I'll do it

5013.9 --> 5022.179
harder I'll do it more fanatically

5017.739 --> 5024.28
because [ __ ] your manipulation yeah this

5022.179 --> 5027.1
hamster is digging a well

5024.28 --> 5029.4
I ain't sucking from your [ __ ] straw

5027.1 --> 5029.400000000001
anymore

5053.98 --> 5058.9
find and read the Dutch government find

5056.5 --> 5061.32
for loud cars and motorcycles do I agree

5058.9 --> 5061.32
with this

5062.199 --> 5068.799999999999
well from a legal standpoint I'd say

5066.4 --> 5072.5199999999995
absolutely not

5068.8 --> 5073.719
but from a personal standpoint I'd say

5072.52 --> 5076.360000000001
yeah

5073.719 --> 5078.4
thank God

5076.36 --> 5080.86
please

5078.4 --> 5084.04
please do

5080.86 --> 5086.92
and there are technically literal sound

5084.04 --> 5089.98
loudness limits

5086.92 --> 5093.1
like your tailpipe cannot be allowed to

5089.98 --> 5095.5599999999995
be louder than a certain thing

5093.1 --> 5098.08
or you get a fine that's been like that

5095.56 --> 5100.780000000001
like for as long as I can remember like

5098.08 --> 5104.14
even before I was born it was like that

5100.78 --> 5106.0599999999995
like if it makes too much noise

5104.14 --> 5108.64
then you create noise pollutant and

5106.06 --> 5111.580000000001
that's illegal that's been like that

5108.64 --> 5113.8
forever Stevie Trevor

5111.58 --> 5115.719
but I don't know maybe they want to

5113.8 --> 5117.820000000001
crank it down even worse maybe they're

5115.719 --> 5119.32
like oh no you can't even have a little

5117.82 --> 5121.179
bit of sound if they're gonna do that

5119.32 --> 5123.5199999999995
then it's totally [ __ ]

5121.179 --> 5125.38
then it's just another effort to get rid

5123.52 --> 5129.84
of combustion engines

5125.38 --> 5129.84
like it's not because of reasonable

5129.94 --> 5135.5199999999995
reasons

5131.56 --> 5137.860000000001
but because they want to manipulate

5135.52 --> 5139.3
everything into a different type of

5137.86 --> 5142.9
Industry

5139.3 --> 5144.34
and I'm absolutely opposed to that

5142.9 --> 5148.179
yeah

5144.34 --> 5150.78
because I do want like loud [ __ ]

5148.179 --> 5153.82
mobiles to basically get the [ __ ] out

5150.78 --> 5156.5199999999995
like go and make your noise on a race

5153.82 --> 5158.34
track or something right like you want

5156.52 --> 5160.26
to go

5158.34 --> 5163.26
way

5160.26 --> 5167.08
you want that I get it man it's awesome

5163.26 --> 5168.280000000001
get the [ __ ] away from the city you

5167.08 --> 5171.88
[ __ ]

5168.28 --> 5174.219
make noise in places where other people

5171.88 --> 5175.6
will not be bothered by the [ __ ]

5174.219 --> 5176.62
noise then

5175.6 --> 5178.6
yeah

5176.62 --> 5179.62
go do it somewhere else in the middle of

5178.6 --> 5181.96
nowhere

5179.62 --> 5186.719
go do it at a racetrack awesome you want

5181.96 --> 5186.719
to do that you go and do that not here

5187.36 --> 5190.86
I hate noise pollution

5193.3 --> 5197.8
yeah so

5195.34 --> 5200.5
if it's still the same reasonable

5197.8 --> 5202.6
limitations then yeah I'm all for that

5200.5 --> 5204.219
but if they're like crap like they're

5202.6 --> 5206.5
tightening it up and now you can't make

5204.219 --> 5208.06
any kind of noise anymore then it's go

5206.5 --> 5210.28
[ __ ] yourself

5208.06 --> 5213.46
I'll [ __ ] drive you over with my

5210.28 --> 5216.84
truck instead how about that [ __ ]

5213.46 --> 5216.84
that's my response then

5228.699 --> 5235.0199999999995
so is that an does that answer your

5231.76 --> 5235.02
questions Demi Trevor

5238.02 --> 5243.34
automatic noise monitors yeah just

5241.3 --> 5249.0
[ __ ] destroy them

5243.34 --> 5249.0
dude just bash them off the poles again

5257.56 --> 5263.280000000001
damn it get the [ __ ] out of here

5263.88 --> 5267.4800000000005
hate this

5268.84 --> 5274.02
eight [ __ ] websites that do that

5276.28 --> 5279.9
get out

5284.38 --> 5290.56
like sorry steemit travel it's just that

5287.38 --> 5294.159000000001
yeah I had to literally like

5290.56 --> 5296.820000000001
spend freaking 10 seconds just to get

5294.159 --> 5301.719
the [ __ ] cookie pop up out of the way

5296.82 --> 5301.719
I hate that intensely

5316.06 --> 5320.92
five decibels above permitted noise

5319.42 --> 5323.56
levels

5320.92 --> 5324.76
okay

5323.56 --> 5328.780000000001
well

5324.76 --> 5331.719
steamy traveler from what I see here

5328.78 --> 5333.34
like the new system of automatic finds

5331.719 --> 5335.5
will make noise in French it's much

5333.34 --> 5337.6
easier to police than in the current

5335.5 --> 5338.98
case

5337.6 --> 5342.88
right

5338.98 --> 5345.839999999999
400 Euro

5342.88 --> 5345.84
fine

5347.62 --> 5353.3
or was it again

5350.24 --> 5353.3
[Music]

5356.86 --> 5362.799999999999
five decibels over permitted noise level

5359.38 --> 5365.32
so it is not like oh you get like one

5362.8 --> 5368.8
kilometer an hour too fast and you get a

5365.32 --> 5369.759999999999
fine not nothing like that it is so it

5368.8 --> 5372.6990000000005
seems

5369.76 --> 5374.9800000000005
seems reasonable steamy travel from what

5372.699 --> 5377.32
I'm seeing there

5374.98 --> 5379.839999999999
it doesn't see it seemed to be part of

5377.32 --> 5381.58
actually keeping order yeah I'm not

5379.84 --> 5383.8
against using

5381.58 --> 5388.3
technology and

5383.8 --> 5389.9800000000005
Robotics and AI to keep order right

5388.3 --> 5392.860000000001
efficiency

5389.98 --> 5394.9
you have proper order proper balance and

5392.86 --> 5396.82
then you make it more efficient

5394.9 --> 5399.759999999999
that's good

5396.82 --> 5402.04
that's not bad it's bad when I said

5399.76 --> 5404.7390000000005
certainly say like oh you can't make any

5402.04 --> 5408.58
noise anymore oh it's like oh nothing

5404.739 --> 5411.5199999999995
why because climate change oh the noise

5408.58 --> 5414.34
pollution is creating new climate change

5411.52 --> 5416.139
somehow yeah and then like suddenly

5414.34 --> 5418.900000000001
everybody like nobody can drive a car

5416.139 --> 5420.9400000000005
anymore because they make noise and it's

5418.9 --> 5422.04
too much noise right if they've done

5420.94 --> 5425.259999999999
that

5422.04 --> 5427.42
then I'd say [ __ ] burn those devices

5425.26 --> 5430.0
down get your clubs and just [ __ ]

5427.42 --> 5432.76
bash them off the of the poles

5430.0 --> 5435.46
but from reading this article they're

5432.76 --> 5439.179
just being used

5435.46 --> 5441.639
in a more efficient way

5439.179 --> 5445.9800000000005
deal with policing against noise

5441.639 --> 5445.9800000000005
pollution so seems reasonable

5450.159 --> 5455.4
better oil the chain on your bike so you

5452.8 --> 5455.400000000001
don't get a ticket

5455.679 --> 5462.12
uh that's gonna be a really loud

5459.46 --> 5465.46
cracking chain then

5462.12 --> 5467.62
I mean I don't think a bike can even

5465.46 --> 5471.719
make that much noise

5467.62 --> 5471.719
even if it is all cranky

5472.42 --> 5479.02
compared to a combustion engine

5475.02 --> 5481.139
or like a hard-breaking car

5479.02 --> 5483.9400000000005
like

5481.139 --> 5485.08
that's that's a hard noise I mean their

5483.94 --> 5487.599999999999
bike

5485.08 --> 5490.08
your crikey bike is not gonna make that

5487.6 --> 5490.08
much noise

5504.88 --> 5508.9800000000005
anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the

5506.8 --> 5508.9800000000005
show

5512.02 --> 5516.639
at least there's no end to the amount of

5514.78 --> 5519.759999999999

5516.639 --> 5522.04
talking all over the place aren't we

5519.76 --> 5524.1990000000005
and that makes it very difficult for me

5522.04 --> 5526.38
to actually figure out a title for a

5524.199 --> 5526.379999999999
show

5550.36 --> 5556.86
name your rainbows what's that thing

what do you guys think it's that's what

5612.1 --> 5618.719
I got kind of came up with

5615.34 --> 5618.719
it can still be changed

5628.28 --> 5631.429999999999
[Music]

5633.76 --> 5640.719

during class

5947.44 --> 5952.0599999999995

that that teacher is going to kick you

5959.739 --> 5964.54
really

5961.48 --> 5966.218999999999
now that I'm so incredibly open is my

5964.54 --> 5968.5
weird little thing

5966.219 --> 5970.8
but technically it's none of your

5968.5 --> 5970.8
business

5971.44 --> 5974.61
[Music]

5975.84 --> 5980.679
I got accounts that showed up the same

5978.46 --> 5983.58
day is he is he that

5980.679 --> 5983.58
you check

5987.94 --> 5994.0599999999995
oh wow he is you're right

5991.179 --> 5995.32
yeah well spotted slow mo moon buggy

5994.06 --> 5997.6
you're right

5995.32 --> 6000.44
I hadn't even seen that

5997.6 --> 6000.4400000000005
I didn't check

6011.52 --> 6015.320000000001
you checked yesterday oh okay

6015.719 --> 6020.34
okay well slow thank you slow mo moon

6018.48 --> 6026.0
buggy yeah

6020.34 --> 6029.639
chat sir like chat information service

6026.0 --> 6033.239
is kind of like the flatter like Secret

6029.639 --> 6035.0
Service guy from chat to me you got

6033.239 --> 6036.959999999999
really good sources

6035.0 --> 6039.9
but uh

6036.96 --> 6043.159
you mentioned it yesterday um I think I

6039.9 --> 6043.159
must have like overlooked that

6043.62 --> 6047.599999999999
but the chat was pretty busy yesterday

6048.26 --> 6052.62
and sometimes it's difficult to keep

6050.58 --> 6054.42
track sometimes you guys just all shut

6052.62 --> 6056.159
up and then like why is nobody saying

6054.42 --> 6057.96
anything and then gets going and then

6056.159 --> 6059.699
all of you talk through one another and

6057.96 --> 6061.38
then I'm like trying to respond to like

6059.699 --> 6062.4
four different people at the same time

6061.38 --> 6065.42
and it's

6062.4 --> 6065.42
things get lost

6066.179 --> 6070.02
enjoy doing it yeah and I really

6067.92 --> 6071.76
appreciate you doing it I mean you've

6070.02 --> 6074.780000000001
helped me out quite a few times with

6071.76 --> 6074.780000000001
some really good pointers

6076.44 --> 6078.5599999999995
um

6084.84 --> 6093.32
looking for a date come date me

6088.679 --> 6093.32
it feels pretty open it's what

6098.28 --> 6102.38
okay that's hilarious Richard G

6102.42 --> 6108.719
yeah well a date with me would be I will

6105.239 --> 6112.638999999999
cook for you organic it will be the best

6108.719 --> 6112.639
meal you've ever had potentially

6112.739 --> 6117.36
and uh

6115.26 --> 6120.4400000000005
I'm mostly gonna be intellectually

6117.36 --> 6123.239
probing you and testing your abilities

6120.44 --> 6125.339999999999
like socially and potentially

6123.239 --> 6128.659
psychically

6125.34 --> 6128.659000000001
oh I will

6132.42 --> 6137.04
yeah I mean

6134.699 --> 6139.98
I'm much more interested in those things

6137.04 --> 6142.5
in those qualities than sex

6139.98 --> 6143.58
and here's why if those qualities are

6142.5 --> 6146.52
there

6143.58 --> 6147.9
then I don't would need to know what sex

6146.52 --> 6149.820000000001
would be like

6147.9 --> 6152.5199999999995
because

6149.82 --> 6156.799999999999
you have those things

6152.52 --> 6156.8
which means it will be great

6162.36 --> 6168.38
when but when the bill comes we're

6165.54 --> 6168.38
splitting this

6169.26 --> 6174.139
well that depends on the girl Richard

6171.48 --> 6174.138999999999
for me

6181.98 --> 6191.159
I mean if she can like really get me all

6188.06 --> 6193.619000000001
testosterone up then she can basically

6191.159 --> 6197.4
get me to the point where I insist to

6193.619 --> 6197.4
pay all of it but

6203.699 --> 6210.48
you were just joking mostly this dude

6207.48 --> 6213.48
it's all right it it all depends man I

6210.48 --> 6216.299999999999
mean sometimes the girls insist like no

6213.48 --> 6218.759999999999
I'm gonna pay half why because they're

6216.3 --> 6221.159000000001
afraid that they're gonna be basically

6218.76 --> 6223.26
said like I paid for you now I want to

6221.159 --> 6224.46
have sex that actually happens it's

6223.26 --> 6227.159000000001
really

6224.46 --> 6229.82
annoying

6227.159 --> 6229.82
but

6240.48 --> 6246.0599999999995
like I I am not like that at all like I

6244.619 --> 6248.159
would never like

6246.06 --> 6250.679
make anybody do

6248.159 --> 6253.759999999999
um a woman do something against their

6250.679 --> 6253.76
will like that

6261.199 --> 6267.719
like because my objective is not to have

6265.26 --> 6270.84
sex with them my objective is to have

6267.719 --> 6272.639
them want to have sex with me

6270.84 --> 6274.92
that's what I want and then I don't even

6272.639 --> 6278.659000000001
need to have sex I just want them to

6274.92 --> 6278.659
want it with me and that's good enough

6279.06 --> 6285.780000000001
weird I guess

6281.84 --> 6289.76
I mean yeah with that from that approach

6285.78 --> 6289.759999999999
you can just go Tantra

6293.76 --> 6298.02
you could

6295.199 --> 6300.0
anyway I don't know I'm freaking talking

6298.02 --> 6302.719
about this [ __ ]

6300.0 --> 6302.719
uh

6303.119 --> 6305.54
dating

6308.159 --> 6313.92
dating no vaxes ever

6311.58 --> 6316.92
I'm gonna probe you mentally spiritually

6313.92 --> 6320.28
test how vulnerable you are how good you

6316.92 --> 6323.36
would hold up in a literal like end

6320.28 --> 6323.36
times War

6323.82 --> 6328.5599999999995
a psychological end times war against

6326.639 --> 6330.42
the system that's gonna force you to

6328.56 --> 6332.639
[ __ ] everything up sacrifice everything

6330.42 --> 6336.32
you have

6332.639 --> 6339.42
for [ __ ] reasons that are being

6336.32 --> 6343.679
spread out top down yeah they're gonna

6339.42 --> 6345.78
have to like be serious Warriors in that

6343.679 --> 6347.34
sense as a woman

6345.78 --> 6350.34
they're gonna have to have a Female

6347.34 --> 6354.56
warrior within them and still

6350.34 --> 6354.56
realize that they are a woman

6354.6 --> 6358.5
right

6355.679 --> 6360.4800000000005
so I don't want some Sarah Connor that's

6358.5 --> 6362.52
also going to be a [ __ ] feminist and

6360.48 --> 6365.5199999999995
like I don't need no man ever that sort

6362.52 --> 6368.360000000001
of [ __ ] like the [ __ ] off get the [ __ ]

6365.52 --> 6368.360000000001
out of here then

6370.44 --> 6375.239
but if you will are willing to be well

6372.719 --> 6377.28
like Sarah Connor in the movie it is

6375.239 --> 6379.919999999999
literally like that why is she like that

6377.28 --> 6382.5
because she's there to like fanatically

6379.92 --> 6386.76
protect her son

6382.5 --> 6388.619
like at all costs like that's what I'm

6386.76 --> 6390.900000000001
looking for

6388.619 --> 6393.48
to a degree

6390.9 --> 6398.28
because they're sure gonna have to like

6393.48 --> 6401.4
not find it acceptable for orchid to

6398.28 --> 6406.44
like choose that they might be a [ __ ]

6401.4 --> 6409.799999999999
or something like no no you will not

6406.44 --> 6412.44
yeah and if it later turns out that they

6409.8 --> 6414.42
are like whatever they do they're like

6412.44 --> 6416.46
can't help but find themselves attracted

6414.42 --> 6419.04
to men all the time and like and they

6416.46 --> 6420.42
don't find women if it turns out like

6419.04 --> 6423.659
that later

6420.42 --> 6426.1990000000005
then [ __ ] hell man but I at least

6423.659 --> 6426.199
tried

6426.84 --> 6433.9800000000005
but they will not be [ __ ] gay kids

6431.4 --> 6436.379999999999
that is not going to happen and you will

6433.98 --> 6439.379999999999
not be allowed to hang around other

6436.38 --> 6441.6
people like that at all like if I find

6439.38 --> 6444.619
you doing that we'll literally move to

6441.6 --> 6444.619000000001
the middle of nowhere

6445.139 --> 6449.36
just so you will not do that

6462.9 --> 6467.58
I mean

6464.3 --> 6469.320000000001
I'd literally send my kid to a farm it's

6467.58 --> 6470.639
like oh really

6469.32 --> 6472.679
really

6470.639 --> 6476.28
you want to be part of this garbage

6472.679 --> 6479.9
satanic garbage well how about you just

6476.28 --> 6479.9
go work for this Farm now

6484.56 --> 6490.38
yeah you'll be too [ __ ] busy to get

6487.5 --> 6492.06
to drown in the satanic delusional horse

6490.38 --> 6495.139
[ __ ] that's being fed

6492.06 --> 6495.139
from the top down

6503.04 --> 6507.119
and there's a good chance that I'd be

6504.659 --> 6509.839999999999
working at that same Farm as well

6507.119 --> 6509.839999999999
then

6510.9 --> 6514.679
I've actually been thinking of that it's

6513.42 --> 6518.82
like

6514.679 --> 6520.86
how would I do would I do well

6518.82 --> 6523.799999999999
working at a farm I mean it is like

6520.86 --> 6527.179
incredibly busy and I probably would get

6523.8 --> 6527.179
a bit tired of that

6528.48 --> 6533.099999999999
it's like I like farming I like the idea

6530.76 --> 6536.9400000000005
of farming but I do not like

6533.1 --> 6540.8
the idea of having to do that forever

6536.94 --> 6540.799999999999
that part I do not like

6543.3 --> 6551.639
like I would get sick of it I would

6547.86 --> 6554.54
of the just the sheer amount of it all

6551.639 --> 6554.54
foreign

6564.42 --> 6569.6990000000005
what's the probability of me finding

6566.88 --> 6572.34
somebody with a exclusive but there's a

6569.699 --> 6574.739
exclusive qualities

6572.34 --> 6577.5
zero

6574.739 --> 6580.86
it's not about chances it's about

6577.5 --> 6582.659
whether that matters or not like when

6580.86 --> 6586.099999999999
love happens

6582.659 --> 6586.099999999999
Everything Changes anyway

6586.32 --> 6592.5599999999995
like falling actually falling in love

6589.38 --> 6595.400000000001
and that going through that changes

6592.56 --> 6595.400000000001
things so

6596.639 --> 6600.08
I don't know but

6600.36 --> 6604.94
yeah I mean the chances are very little

6604.98 --> 6610.5599999999995
that it's gonna be exactly like that and

6607.38 --> 6613.38
I don't know maybe I have to like

6610.56 --> 6615.42
reduce it or maybe somebody will

6613.38 --> 6617.28
literally like walk up and like yeah

6615.42 --> 6620.04
I've been looking for somebody that

6617.28 --> 6622.98
finally takes this serious

6620.04 --> 6625.92
and that isn't just a useless piece of

6622.98 --> 6628.138999999999
[ __ ] on top of it all

6625.92 --> 6632.0
it's not just saying it now that

6628.139 --> 6632.0
actually does also live a

6632.34 --> 6636.08
like a life correctly

6640.32 --> 6645.54
all right

6642.78 --> 6648.38
or somebody that believes in my message

6645.54 --> 6648.38
in what I do

6652.5 --> 6655.4
I don't know

6658.56 --> 6666.0
but yeah when I don't know like the

6661.44 --> 6669.239
whole the the Jackson part I don't know

6666.0 --> 6671.94
tarot I literally do not know how many

6669.239 --> 6675.5599999999995
people out there have been

6671.94 --> 6675.5599999999995
yeah I don't know

6676.619 --> 6681.42
it's also because some people keep it a

6679.8 --> 6683.639
secret

6681.42 --> 6685.679
right before they would brag about it

6683.639 --> 6687.42
and now that they found out they all

6685.679 --> 6689.54
been [ __ ] now they're all keeping it a

6687.42 --> 6689.54
secret

6692.76 --> 6697.38
so I don't know

6694.739 --> 6698.4
I really don't know I don't know how

6697.38 --> 6701.639
many

6698.4 --> 6704.339999999999
like teenage women and women in their

6701.639 --> 6706.6990000000005
20s have actually been stupid enough to

6704.34 --> 6706.6990000000005
do that

6725.46 --> 6733.02
but on the other hand tarot I mean

6728.719 --> 6735.119
there are billions of people in the

6733.02 --> 6736.56
world

6735.119 --> 6738.199
I mean

6736.56 --> 6740.46
when you look at it like that

6738.199 --> 6745.04
statistically like

6740.46 --> 6745.04
there has to be somebody there

6746.04 --> 6750.3
or if they're not now then no they would

6748.92 --> 6752.639
have to be there I mean I'm not going to

6750.3 --> 6755.1
wait 18 years till they're adult or

6752.639 --> 6759.32
anything but yeah

6755.1 --> 6759.320000000001
somebody would have to be there

6771.48 --> 6774.5599999999995
we'll see

6775.5 --> 6778.04
foreign

6798.5 --> 6805.08
my issue is it's not even like

6801.98 --> 6807.48
girlfriends right I'm much more worried

6805.08 --> 6810.0199999999995
with myself when it comes to just

6807.48 --> 6810.0199999999995
friends

6810.659 --> 6815.46
I'm really worried about that part and

6813.42 --> 6817.8
that part's always been difficult with

6815.46 --> 6821.54
me to have friends that I really feel

6817.8 --> 6821.54
like I want to hang around with them

6822.179 --> 6827.76
I used to always have that always have

6825.78 --> 6830.82
friends like that since I was a little

6827.76 --> 6834.06
kid since like six

6830.82 --> 6837.719
and since Flat Earth

6834.06 --> 6839.46
since that last friend Circle suddenly

6837.719 --> 6842.639
dropped off like that

6839.46 --> 6843.9
it was already like getting very small

6842.639 --> 6846.659000000001
but

6843.9 --> 6849.42
I'm more worried about just

6846.659 --> 6851.759999999999
not really knowing how to deal with

6849.42 --> 6853.619
people anymore

6851.76 --> 6855.2390000000005
not talking about women I'm talking

6853.619 --> 6858.719
about people

6855.239 --> 6862.138999999999
like social behavior out there and what

6858.719 --> 6864.84
people are used to talking about all

6862.139 --> 6867.54
that that's the real part that I'm

6864.84 --> 6870.6
actually worried about not about oh I

6867.54 --> 6873.119
couldn't score a girl dude

6870.6 --> 6877.139
I am [ __ ] gorgeous

6873.119 --> 6880.199
I have a great talent with my voice I

6877.139 --> 6881.1
look halfway decent I'm very passionate

6880.199 --> 6883.5599999999995
dude

6881.1 --> 6887.820000000001
there's no [ __ ] way that I can't get

6883.56 --> 6890.219
a woman okay if I wanted to I can once I

6887.82 --> 6892.799999999999
decide that it happens

6890.219 --> 6895.26
it really does

6892.8 --> 6898.1990000000005
just like the last time

6895.26 --> 6901.1
and I mean my ex is freaking amazing

6898.199 --> 6901.099999999999
looking so

6902.82 --> 6907.679
the issue is is really that I'm afraid

6905.46 --> 6909.2390000000005
that I don't know how to [ __ ] talk

6907.679 --> 6911.76
with people anymore

6909.239 --> 6913.0199999999995
like yesterday I was there was like this

6911.76 --> 6915.900000000001
party

6913.02 --> 6918.2390000000005
down here just a bunch of guys yapping

6915.9 --> 6919.619
and drinking and stuff and it sounded

6918.239 --> 6921.54
kind of nice

6919.619 --> 6923.759999999999
and I was just standing there at the

6921.54 --> 6926.639
balcony like

6923.76 --> 6929.219
I really want to join them actually but

6926.639 --> 6931.56
I have no I don't know them

6929.219 --> 6935.4800000000005
and I was also spotting how they were

6931.56 --> 6935.4800000000005
kind of talking weird like

6935.639 --> 6941.52
they were talking in such a

6938.119 --> 6943.739
underdeveloped way with each other and

6941.52 --> 6946.4400000000005
that's really the normal way but so

6943.739 --> 6949.799999999999
underdeveloped that it's like

6946.44 --> 6951.839999999999
I can barely even follow any logical

6949.8 --> 6955.4400000000005
consistency

6951.84 --> 6959.34
even on a spiritual level like I don't

6955.44 --> 6961.0199999999995
understand these [ __ ] people anymore

6959.34 --> 6962.639
and they were just having normal

6961.02 --> 6965.159000000001
conversations

6962.639 --> 6968.900000000001
and like

6965.159 --> 6968.9
I don't understand that

6971.159 --> 6974.659
don't [ __ ] yourself [ __ ]

6987.06 --> 6992.400000000001
right so I'm more worried about

6990.179 --> 6994.679
not really knowing how to deal with

6992.4 --> 6997.98
people anymore

6994.679 --> 7002.5
in communication type scenarios

6997.98 --> 7002.5
then actually attracting women

7008.06 --> 7011.900000000001
discussion that most people have today

7009.98 --> 7015.699
is full cringe yeah

7011.9 --> 7015.699
and I [ __ ] waste of time

7016.94 --> 7021.919999999999
it's like an emotional waste of time

7019.4 --> 7025.219
they're like literally wasting their

7021.92 --> 7027.5
feelings on absolute horseshit that is

7025.219 --> 7029.2390000000005
inconsequential sometimes it doesn't

7027.5 --> 7033.28
even really exist

7029.239 --> 7033.28
since virtual horse [ __ ]

7033.86 --> 7040.598999999999
and it's shocking it's like jarring to

7037.94 --> 7040.598999999999
witness that

7065.52 --> 7068.599
[Music]

7071.32 --> 7078.199
right so in that sense it really I have

7075.199 --> 7081.86
really over the years kind of put myself

7078.199 --> 7084.5
into like a matrix-like position

7081.86 --> 7087.0199999999995
where to me it's like yeah I mean

7084.5 --> 7090.02
they're all normies but

7087.02 --> 7092.42
agent Smith can come out any second

7090.02 --> 7094.099
because all these people literally don't

7092.42 --> 7095.54
know what the [ __ ] this world is like

7094.099 --> 7097.46
they don't know what the hell is going

7095.54 --> 7100.46
on they have suspicions but it's all

7097.46 --> 7102.199
super primitive they're like right in

yeah she loved she specifically said

that

7116.179 --> 7119.7390000000005
yeah

7117.739 --> 7119.739
yeah

7121.88 --> 7124.599

7125.179 --> 7128.5

that is nice

[Music]

7156.619 --> 7163.339999999999
because I mean everything has to do with

7158.9 --> 7167.0
my hair of course guys right I mean

7163.34 --> 7170.719
nobody with this hair could ever expect

7167.0 --> 7173.06
to ever attract a woman it's like

7170.719 --> 7175.82
because people that are trolls in the

7173.06 --> 7179.619000000001
chat have absolutely no idea how that

7175.82 --> 7179.619
all works at all

7184.58 --> 7190.099
because they're a bunch of gamma spazzes

7186.92 --> 7192.1990000000005
that are probably into Beauty magazines

7190.099 --> 7195.26
because they're [ __ ]

7192.199 --> 7197.299999999999
or they're a bunch of losers that

7195.26 --> 7200.06
literally only

7197.3 --> 7202.28
pay women to have sex with them

7200.06 --> 7203.54
because they don't even know how to do

7202.28 --> 7206.78
anything

7203.54 --> 7210.099
towards actual women

7206.78 --> 7210.099
so either one of those

7210.679 --> 7214.639
yeah

7212.78 --> 7216.0199999999995
that's the people that are trolling

minutes straight

7289.58 --> 7293.9
at the end of my show which will

7291.619 --> 7296.0
immediately make me round out the show

7293.9 --> 7298.5199999999995
because you're literally just stopped

7296.0 --> 7301.34
talking for five minutes straight right

7298.52 --> 7303.9800000000005
at the end of two hours when hey if you

7301.34 --> 7306.679
would continue talking and not just let

7303.98 --> 7310.54
trolls do the [ __ ] talking in my chat

7306.679 --> 7310.54
then you might get another hour

7314.84 --> 7323.06
but since nobody is actually piping up

7318.02 --> 7327.9400000000005
in my chat I am going to round out now

7323.06 --> 7327.9400000000005
yeah you got literally 30 seconds

7340.04 --> 7343.0
what the [ __ ]

why that

7358.34 --> 7364.04

hell is the rest of my chat

7367.219 --> 7370.96
what the [ __ ] is going on here

7381.5 --> 7387.619
yeah I missed this comment

7384.32 --> 7390.44
from watchmaker Richard G and skeptic

7387.619 --> 7393.619
yeah hello guys yeah no what the [ __ ]

7390.44 --> 7396.138999999999
the chat was just like turn off all of a

7393.619 --> 7398.719
sudden out of nowhere it's just like it

7396.139 --> 7400.28
scroll bar was gone and it just nothing

7398.719 --> 7402.02
happened anymore

7400.28 --> 7405.08
what the hell

7402.02 --> 7407.119000000001
but yeah I see you all there now so I

7405.08 --> 7410.0
guess I'll keep going

7407.119 --> 7412.28
but watchmaker says Evie is more

7410.0 --> 7414.46
important than having friends and a

7412.28 --> 7414.46
family

7414.56 --> 7420.02
even if one dies alone Effie is the best

7418.099 --> 7423.02
that's

7420.02 --> 7423.02
uh

7425.78 --> 7432.04
I don't know about that watchmaker

7428.599 --> 7432.04
I don't know about that

7434.659 --> 7440.36
I mean I'm glad that I have an Fe online

I'm not happy with doing this and you

7458.599 --> 7463.179
guys being there to support me it's just

7460.88 --> 7463.179
that

7463.28 --> 7469.36
actual face-to-face socializing that's

7466.46 --> 7469.36

7588.32 --> 7592.699
like

7590.0 --> 7595.159
like somebody is making the photograph

7592.699 --> 7597.138999999999
of the chat and then it's that is what

7595.159 --> 7599.0
you get to see it's like you can't

7597.139 --> 7605.08
actually interact anymore

7599.0 --> 7605.08

7612.08 --> 7614.739

7627.98 --> 7633.739
I did and then him two days ago

7631.699 --> 7636.5599999999995
what a weird thing for him to say that

7633.739 --> 7639.138999999999
when he's already shown up in my chat

7636.56 --> 7642.400000000001
after I banned him

7639.139 --> 7642.400000000001

7669.199 --> 7671.839999999999
especially when I start the show it's

7671.0 --> 7674.84

7671.84 --> 7677.96
good morning and then it's like message

7674.84 --> 7681.099

7677.96 --> 7684.08
morning no something went wrong again

7681.099 --> 7686.719
and then I like have to like

7684.08 --> 7688.76
refresh the browser and then eventually

7686.719 --> 7690.679
it'll stick

7688.76 --> 7693.6990000000005
that's that's something that's been

7690.679 --> 7693.6990000000005
happening regularly

post it in my chat slow mode it does

7894.98 --> 7899.32
see you posted the link there slow mo

7896.9 --> 7899.32
thanks

7903.32 --> 7907.28
ah you've been digging into mine

7905.0 --> 7910.159
unveiled that yeah they have a huge

7907.28 --> 7912.8
collection I know

7910.159 --> 7915.32
just that one homunculus video alone is

7912.8 --> 7918.139
insanely large

7915.32 --> 7922.119
but yeah they have a lot more than that

7918.139 --> 7922.119
it's not their first really big video

7922.36 --> 7928.88
and it is fast it is good Channel isn't

7925.34 --> 7931.28
it they got so much good sources

7928.88 --> 7932.84
and just for the sources alone it's very

7931.28 --> 7937.099
interesting

7932.84 --> 7940.88
and they do like in their rollout

7937.099 --> 7944.4800000000005
they stay very open-minded and

7940.88 --> 7946.28
like could it be right not like oh this

7944.48 --> 7948.259999999999
is definitely that or in that or it's

7946.28 --> 7949.58
like oh no it seems to be this it seems

7948.26 --> 7951.679
to be that and this is the connection

7949.58 --> 7952.88
this is similarity so this is like

7951.679 --> 7955.9400000000005
really

7952.88 --> 7958.219
the vernacular seems like they're doing

7955.94 --> 7959.719
really careful considerations and

7958.219 --> 7963.159
research

7959.719 --> 7963.159
that makes it just

7963.26 --> 7970.159000000001
better it just seems better researched

7967.639 --> 7972.56
than most other type conspiracy videos

7970.159 --> 7974.42
like that

7972.56 --> 7975.92
and they have been from the start I mean

7974.42 --> 7978.92
and they've gotten better too they're

7975.92 --> 7982.179
getting better as as the years passed so

7978.92 --> 7982.179
it's a really good Channel

7993.079 --> 7999.28
you stumbled into jiren's video last

7995.96 --> 7999.28
night and oh boy

7999.5 --> 8007.079
uh you which one oh my God there's all

8003.219 --> 8007.079
this horse [ __ ] going on out there

8007.719 --> 8010.92
which one now

8015.46 --> 8020.92
I mean this is starting to turn into

8017.44 --> 8024.598999999999
like a wwfe

8020.92 --> 8024.599
Championship or something

8029.5 --> 8035.76
it's like all of them

8031.46 --> 8039.06
[Music]

8035.76 --> 8039.06
Jaron and

8039.719 --> 8048.579
Simon Dan and Dell

8044.46 --> 8050.76
flat sword and Nathan Oakley and oh my

8048.579 --> 8050.759999999999
God

8052.96 --> 8058.42
now Nathan Oakley is not really doing it

8055.3 --> 8060.900000000001
he's mostly not doing that but you know

8058.42 --> 8060.9
what I mean

8066.46 --> 8070.36
somebody behind the scenes is

8068.679 --> 8073.719
manipulating people

8070.36 --> 8075.759999999999
no I don't get that feeling but I do get

8073.719 --> 8079.659
the feeling that they are manipulating

8075.76 --> 8083.76
that they are playing politics and I've

8079.659 --> 8083.759999999999
seen I've called that for years

8084.06 --> 8089.679
globusters specifically and that

8086.8 --> 8092.079000000001
includes Jaren is that they are playing

8089.679 --> 8095.4
politics

8092.079 --> 8099.299999999999
it's a very subtle thing

8095.4 --> 8102.5199999999995
they're always like group behavioral

8099.3 --> 8104.8
stuff like that

8102.52 --> 8106.900000000001
it's like no no we did do this we will

8104.8 --> 8109.78
just do that

8106.9 --> 8113.82
this is how we see it like even the

8109.78 --> 8113.82
vernacular that they express about it

8116.02 --> 8119.56
all right

8117.04 --> 8122.98
and in that sense I mean over at Nathan

8119.56 --> 8126.280000000001
Oakley's we do that too here's the thing

8122.98 --> 8129.459999999999
though we definitely check for errors

8126.28 --> 8131.619
all the time and we criticize

8129.46 --> 8133.0
and then really get into it and then

8131.619 --> 8136.239
like

8133.0 --> 8139.78
the result of a discussion like that

8136.239 --> 8141.82
will lead to absolutely certainly

8139.78 --> 8144.88
improvements

8141.82 --> 8147.579
that will be accepted and not just like

8144.88 --> 8149.86
oh yeah we talked about this and now I'm

8147.579 --> 8152.259999999999
going to ignore that and then roll out

8149.86 --> 8154.54
the same [ __ ] I was doing before that

8152.26 --> 8157.0
over and over and over again after it

8154.54 --> 8159.46
yeah that's something that we typically

8157.0 --> 8162.76
don't do at fed

8159.46 --> 8166.619
however Jaren and glow Busters and

8162.76 --> 8166.619000000001
Associates do do that

8176.32 --> 8180.699
yeah there's been a whole bunch of

8177.639 --> 8181.900000000001
excommunication from Bob and Whitsett

8180.699 --> 8183.4
and

8181.9 --> 8185.739
all of them

8183.4 --> 8187.119
oh and apparently

8185.739 --> 8189.04
it that's probably what you're

8187.119 --> 8191.679
addressing right is that Nathan had a

8189.04 --> 8195.099
sort of an appeal

8191.679 --> 8196.960000000001
or sort of we it wasn't yesterday's show

8195.099 --> 8198.880000000001
and Nathan was like yeah well maybe

8196.96 --> 8200.38
jiren's gonna turn around again and I

8198.88 --> 8203.438999999998
was just like

8200.38 --> 8205.479
it's like why would you just

8203.439 --> 8208.24
like it's about their

8205.479 --> 8211.438999999998
crowd like we could

8208.24 --> 8211.439
pull in their crowd

8211.54 --> 8216.219000000001
like maybe it's not about jiren what

8213.34 --> 8218.58
about the crowd and apparently Jaron

8216.219 --> 8220.199999999999
responded with a video of himself

8218.58 --> 8223.539999999999
yesterday

8220.2 --> 8225.76
basically like trying to go like oh so

8223.54 --> 8228.460000000001
you're gonna change your mind now

8225.76 --> 8232.2
because of friendship or something

8228.46 --> 8232.199999999999
what the hell was that

8236.74 --> 8243.46
I mean it it seems like Jaren is just

8240.16 --> 8245.859
making a Dell maneuver or something

8243.46 --> 8248.58
they're just trying to like create

8245.859 --> 8248.58
hassle

8250.3 --> 8254.259999999998
and margau was back again briefly yeah I

8252.639 --> 8256.358999999999
noticed him in chat

8254.26 --> 8259.979
now the morgell seems to be unfriendly

8256.359 --> 8259.979000000001
footing with fed right now

8265.62 --> 8271.320000000002
jareness you mean jiren is not gonna

8267.82 --> 8271.32
bury the hatchet no he isn't

8275.26 --> 8281.679
no Jaron is just a [ __ ] [ __ ]

8278.859 --> 8283.92
like that for that time where I actually

8281.679 --> 8286.359
met him in person

8283.92 --> 8290.26
2019 conference yeah I'll never forget

8286.359 --> 8295.899000000001
that Jaren you were just an [ __ ]

8290.26 --> 8295.899
you were an arrogant stuck-up [ __ ]

8295.96 --> 8303.119999999999
that's exactly what you were

8299.62 --> 8307.300000000001
there was no real feeling of Flat Earth

8303.12 --> 8310.300000000001
you even verbally disclaimed that

8307.3 --> 8310.3
publicly

8310.42 --> 8317.019
yeah

8312.219 --> 8319.059
you are a scumbag Jared is a Scoma I

8317.019 --> 8322.059000000001
will never retract that I will never

8319.059 --> 8325.66
seek friendship with this man because he

8322.059 --> 8328.779999999999
is a belligerent scumbag and he doesn't

8325.66 --> 8331.96
give a [ __ ] about flat earthers the only

8328.78 --> 8334.42
thing he cares about is himself

8331.96 --> 8336.639
and his income

8334.42 --> 8340.12
that's what I think

8336.639 --> 8341.74
I think Jared is a fundamentally selfish

8340.12 --> 8344.320000000002
[ __ ]

8341.74 --> 8347.619999999999
that's what I think he is

8344.32 --> 8349.3
and he's unbelievably unrepentingly

8347.62 --> 8351.639000000001
arrogant

8349.3 --> 8356.559
and he always was like that and he was

8351.639 --> 8360.899
like that to me in 2019 when I've never

8356.559 --> 8360.899
said anything bad to anybody

8364.84 --> 8368.62
like the only thing that happened even

8366.639 --> 8374.018999999998
back then was like the whole [ __ ] Bob

8368.62 --> 8375.880000000001
incident where Bob in my chat told me to

8374.019 --> 8378.28
go kill myself

8375.88 --> 8380.88
out of nowhere

8378.28 --> 8380.880000000001
yeah

8381.76 --> 8387.7
so if that was the reason for jiren to

8386.019 --> 8390.16
act like that to me

8387.7 --> 8393.04
then he's a sick [ __ ] too doesn't really

8390.16 --> 8395.32
matter either either way

8393.04 --> 8397.12
I've never said anything bad to him back

8395.32 --> 8400.06
then and he acted like a completely

8397.12 --> 8403.359
arrogant [ __ ] who literally in a

8400.06 --> 8405.399
face-to-face situation refused to just

8403.359 --> 8410.02
shake hands

8405.399 --> 8412.779999999999
politely yeah that's Jared a man who

8410.02 --> 8415.6
refuses to shake hands upon first

8412.78 --> 8419.92
meeting face to face

8415.6 --> 8421.66
that's Jaron a egotistical selfish

8419.92 --> 8425.16
bastard

8421.66 --> 8425.16
that's Jaron

8425.74 --> 8432.699999999999
on top of his ridiculous mctum cookery

8430.08 --> 8435.34
from recent

8432.7 --> 8436.66
yeah I am never befriending that [ __ ]

8435.34 --> 8441.28
ever again

8436.66 --> 8444.819
and quite frankly I am like mortified

8441.28 --> 8446.76
about the notion that like all that

8444.819 --> 8451.8
following he has

8446.76 --> 8451.800000000001
is actually people following him

8452.319 --> 8458.8
that's what concerns me is like wow

8455.26 --> 8461.92
people actually keep following that and

8458.8 --> 8464.619999999999
being fans of him actual people that's

8461.92 --> 8468.6
that's more terrifying to me

8464.62 --> 8468.6
not him as a presence

8468.819 --> 8475.779999999999
as a grifter if you will a scammer an

8472.359 --> 8477.939
internet scamming [ __ ]

8475.78 --> 8482.439
that lies

8477.939 --> 8482.439
and is super anti-social

8482.979 --> 8489.64
yeah and really [ __ ] [ __ ] and a

8485.979 --> 8493.179999999998
[ __ ] as [ __ ] sell out really badly

8489.64 --> 8495.88
right that's all one thing but that he

8493.18 --> 8498.52
has so many supposed followers

8495.88 --> 8500.319
that are real people

8498.52 --> 8502.6
I mean yeah not all of them are going to

8500.319 --> 8504.64
be real people but still a percentage is

8502.6 --> 8507.640000000001
gonna be real people that really follow

8504.64 --> 8510.96
him now that is worrisome

8507.64 --> 8510.96
that's that's scary

8514.6 --> 8518.62
right unless they're like all family or

8517.18 --> 8520.359
something

8518.62 --> 8523.479000000001
they're like no we're with Jerry no

8520.359 --> 8526.979000000001
matter what then I get it

8523.479 --> 8526.979
but I don't think they are

8532.12 --> 8536.2
it's for your anti-fed yeah yeah it's

8534.16 --> 8538.899
the same Dell crowd

8536.2 --> 8541.78
it's the anti-flat Earth or scumbag

8538.899 --> 8545.319
Patrol there's thousands of these people

8541.78 --> 8547.720000000001
they are literally recruiting

8545.319 --> 8549.58
yeah it's like a covert little social

8547.72 --> 8552.58
Army

8549.58 --> 8552.58
anti-fed

8552.64 --> 8558.399
it's not even anti-flatter this anti-fed

8555.18 --> 8561.819
and there's like a whole Cult of it like

8558.399 --> 8563.199999999999
a militia a social media militia is

8561.819 --> 8568.119999999999
building

8563.2 --> 8570.42
we hate fed we hate every day we're in a

8568.12 --> 8570.42
protest

8573.18 --> 8578.56
everyday

8575.46 --> 8581.019999999999
and they go anywhere they go to Dells

8578.56 --> 8584.74
they go to gerunds

8581.02 --> 8587.16
they troll my channels right that's what

8584.74 --> 8587.16
they do

8593.92 --> 8600.1
because yeah they don't like to be

8597.76 --> 8602.68
pointed out how

8600.1 --> 8606.720000000001
the amount of possibilities is

8602.68 --> 8609.7
dramatically limited based on

8606.72 --> 8611.08
demunctionable physical reality

8609.7 --> 8612.880000000001
and there's a lot of people that don't

8611.08 --> 8616.0
like that they just want to hear

8612.88 --> 8618.519999999999
somebody talk and just say whatever the

8616.0 --> 8621.04
[ __ ] they want even if it isn't cohesive

8618.52 --> 8622.960000000001
they just want a nice story in which

8621.04 --> 8624.939
everything is possible whatever they

8622.96 --> 8629.22
could think of is possible they just

8624.939 --> 8629.220000000001
want a little [ __ ] story

8630.16 --> 8634.96
they don't want to be

8632.1 --> 8637.56
facing facts

8634.96 --> 8640.419999999998
of absolute

8637.56 --> 8643.0
demonstrable inevitable physical

8640.42 --> 8644.74
realities they don't want to know

8643.0 --> 8648.58
anything about that they don't want to

8644.74 --> 8651.039999999999
have a grasp of a fitting oversight that

8648.58 --> 8653.38
will show you exactly how things really

8651.04 --> 8655.84
have to be they don't want to know that

8653.38 --> 8658.358999999999
they just want somebody to give them a

8655.84 --> 8663.78
nice little

8658.359 --> 8663.78
fairy tale story we want story time

8665.38 --> 8671.38
and fed doesn't do that everyday doesn't

8668.56 --> 8673.84
allow you to just enjoy your stupid

8671.38 --> 8675.58
little Story Time fed is gonna point out

8673.84 --> 8678.04
how exactly

8675.58 --> 8680.319
those things are incorrect

8678.04 --> 8684.399000000001
and why

8680.319 --> 8687.46
so that it's not just but a logically

8684.399 --> 8691.0
backed argumentation and people don't

8687.46 --> 8694.779999999999
want logically backed argumentation they

8691.0 --> 8697.12
want their stupid [ __ ] story

8694.78 --> 8700.92
because they're [ __ ]

8697.12 --> 8700.92
and they don't have the acumen

8707.26 --> 8709.800000000001
okay

8714.6 --> 8724.08
no the militia meow Elisha that's weird

8721.06 --> 8724.08
post Army

8749.02 --> 8758.7
you're dialing in Fe for so many hours

8752.979 --> 8758.699999999999
and I'm still numpty adjacent at times

8760.78 --> 8765.460000000001
but that's fine everybody's a little

8763.06 --> 8767.8
numpty adjacent as long

8765.46 --> 8770.919999999998
as the the

8767.8 --> 8773.08
you see slow mo moon buggy everybody is

8770.92 --> 8776.26
a little bit a numpty

8773.08 --> 8778.66
it's like it's a polarizer you have to

8776.26 --> 8782.5
have a little numpty or there's like no

8778.66 --> 8784.66
contrast there's no incentive

8782.5 --> 8788.859
yeah

8784.66 --> 8790.96
allegedly only Jesus does not have a

8788.859 --> 8794.08
little numpty in him

8790.96 --> 8796.619999999999
but everybody else does

8794.08 --> 8796.62
right

8798.64 --> 8804.76
the sign a real sign of intelligence is

8802.06 --> 8809.319
not that you do not have

8804.76 --> 8811.84
numpty adjacent traits to you

8809.319 --> 8814.779999999999
the sign of intelligence is that you

8811.84 --> 8818.14
know exactly what your numpty adjacent

8814.78 --> 8821.319000000001
traits are and know how to deal with

8818.14 --> 8826.96
them in order to have them cause

8821.319 --> 8831.479
the minimum amount of damaging influence

8826.96 --> 8831.479
that's the real intelligence

8832.359 --> 8836.74
right because everybody has a little bit

8834.7 --> 8839.560000000001
of numpty and sometimes it's very

8836.74 --> 8842.14
endearing it's like people like to be

8839.56 --> 8844.84
reminded that they're even their strong

8842.14 --> 8848.38
figures that they look up to

8844.84 --> 8851.439
still have vulnerable sides to them that

8848.38 --> 8854.5
they're not all superhero that they have

8851.439 --> 8856.479000000001
a vulnerable side to them or something

8854.5 --> 8858.7
that is underdeveloped where they're not

8856.479 --> 8860.8
good at it and they don't know it

8858.7 --> 8863.62
a little bit of weakness like that's

8860.8 --> 8866.438999999998
endearing to people it makes them feel

8863.62 --> 8868.660000000002
like oh wait it's still a human

8866.439 --> 8870.78
see it's not perfect

8868.66 --> 8873.76
right

8870.78 --> 8876.7
so nobody should expect there to be

8873.76 --> 8881.04
anybody out there that is perfect

8876.7 --> 8881.04
because that's literally unreasonable

8881.08 --> 8884.8
like and the smarter you're the you are

8883.18 --> 8887.26
the more talented you are that's

8884.8 --> 8890.399
absolutely no guarantee that you have no

8887.26 --> 8890.399
stupid sights to you

8893.56 --> 8897.0
it's just that

8897.1 --> 8903.42
the amount of good and effective that

8900.28 --> 8908.16
you can do will outweigh the amount of

8903.42 --> 8908.16
damaging side effect from your stupidity

8913.3 --> 8916.3
foreign

8921.0 --> 8925.6
and the biggest difference between an

8923.68 --> 8928.78
actual stupid person

8925.6 --> 8930.76
and a not so stupid person is that the

8928.78 --> 8933.58
actual stupid person never really

8930.76 --> 8937.06
changes into a

8933.58 --> 8940.359
really smart person

8937.06 --> 8944.08
but a smart person

8940.359 --> 8946.720000000001
can turn into a really stupid person if

8944.08 --> 8950.2
they basically denounce or lay down

8946.72 --> 8952.42
their responsibility their cohesion they

8950.2 --> 8955.359
can give up on the ghost they can give

8952.42 --> 8958.12
up on their intelligence give up unlike

8955.359 --> 8960.58
the struggle of keeping it cohesive yeah

8958.12 --> 8961.359
that's something you actively do in your

8960.58 --> 8963.46
spirit

8961.359 --> 8966.819
you keep it cohesive you're being

8963.46 --> 8969.699999999999
serious people can give that up and then

8966.819 --> 8972.939
literally become a drooling [ __ ]

8969.7 --> 8975.1
that lose that Consciousness yeah that

8972.939 --> 8977.68
can happen

8975.1 --> 8979.960000000001
don't forget

8977.68 --> 8984.399
somebody that is smart

8979.96 --> 8986.88
is smart because they decide to uphold

8984.399 --> 8986.88
it

8988.96 --> 8997.119999999999
because if they give up on upholding it

8993.04 --> 8999.640000000001
then they will lose cohesion

8997.12 --> 9002.1
they will just be free to be frolicky

8999.64 --> 9003.539999999999
and nonsensical or poetic or whatever

9002.1 --> 9005.939
right

9003.54 --> 9009.960000000001
but it won't make any sense

9005.939 --> 9012.92
or it will make less sense

9009.96 --> 9012.919999999998
that's the difference

9014.939 --> 9018.66
well the chat has disappeared on my

9016.859 --> 9021.18
screen again oh okay also it's not

9018.66 --> 9022.02
disappeared here just refresh when that

9021.18 --> 9023.64
happens

9022.02 --> 9027.42
weird

9023.64 --> 9030.599999999999
at least the chat's still like

9027.42 --> 9032.28
on the video screen though I mean that

9030.6 --> 9034.76
chat is not being disrupted that just

9032.28 --> 9034.76
keeps going

9035.28 --> 9041.54
even though it is like technically like

9037.62 --> 9041.54
three sentences behind all the time

9045.54 --> 9051.42
which is on purpose because

9048.78 --> 9055.140000000001
if trolls get in there I need to be able

9051.42 --> 9057.3
to delete it and that nobody's seen it

9055.14 --> 9059.519999999999
so if somebody would type it and then it

9057.3 --> 9062.039999999999
would directly pop onto the actual

9059.52 --> 9064.859
screen then yeah trolls can use that to

9062.04 --> 9067.140000000001
push their nonsense through and this way

9064.859 --> 9070.859
I can delete them before anybody's ever

9067.14 --> 9073.279999999999
noticed that they're there on the video

9070.859 --> 9073.28
right

9074.819 --> 9078.68
well flutter Sage good to see you

9079.439 --> 9085.76
wow we're already

9082.439 --> 9085.76
two and a half hours in

9085.859 --> 9090.359
time is flying when you're having fun

9087.72 --> 9093.358999999999
and the weather is great

9090.359 --> 9095.640000000001
it's getting a bit more cloudy

9093.359 --> 9097.56
still very beautiful

9095.64 --> 9100.319
check it out

9097.56 --> 9103.199999999999
I love that like that deep blue it's

9100.319 --> 9106.08
almost like touching a bit of purple

9103.2 --> 9110.16
isn't it it's like that deep blue is

9106.08 --> 9113.34
almost touching the purple to it I think

9110.16 --> 9115.68
that's like an amazing color

9113.34 --> 9118.439
it's like it's a color that really it

9115.68 --> 9121.319
like gets to my throat

9118.439 --> 9123.78
interesting enough also because the

9121.319 --> 9126.0
throat chakra is actually associated

9123.78 --> 9128.460000000001
with that blue did you know that

9126.0 --> 9131.58
forehead Deep Blue

9128.46 --> 9134.88
throat light blue

9131.58 --> 9136.92
or sky blue and this is the color and

9134.88 --> 9140.938999999998
like every time I see a sky that

9136.92 --> 9142.2
beautiful blue I get a feeling like on

9140.939 --> 9144.12
my throat

9142.2 --> 9145.800000000001
I don't know what that is but it could

9144.12 --> 9147.479000000001
be like the

9145.8 --> 9149.699999999999
like the frequency of the color

9147.479 --> 9151.679999999998
resonating with my chakra or something I

9149.7 --> 9154.979000000001
don't know what it is

9151.68 --> 9160.399
I just know it's a very beautiful blue

9154.979 --> 9160.399
look at how deep blue isn't that amazing

9161.22 --> 9168.599999999999
it's like deep light blue almost a dash

9164.7 --> 9168.6
of purple to it amazing

9178.439 --> 9183.78
80 years old high school teacher science

9182.16 --> 9185.64
teacher okay

9183.78 --> 9188.060000000001
said religion should be kept after

9185.64 --> 9188.06
school

9188.1 --> 9193.439
you didn't have the heart to tell him he

9190.859 --> 9196.819
was be he has been teaching a religion

9193.439 --> 9196.819
his whole adult life

9199.319 --> 9205.619999999999
well slow yeah I mean I wouldn't say

9202.8 --> 9208.58
that over Facebook

9205.62 --> 9212.34
if you want to tell him that Lomo

9208.58 --> 9214.5
I literally would like ask to visit him

9212.34 --> 9216.3
and then like have a talk around the

9214.5 --> 9221.819
table

9216.3 --> 9225.96
right so that he'd feel less embarrassed

9221.819 --> 9228.119999999999
keep it private for him and then like

9225.96 --> 9231.779999999999
that could be a way to confront him

9228.12 --> 9234.359
that's not gonna like just make him hate

9231.78 --> 9237.6
you forever and distrust you

9234.359 --> 9239.819
you're like could get him to like

9237.6 --> 9241.5
yeah it's like hey could can I come over

9239.819 --> 9243.8
to your place I want to discuss

9241.5 --> 9243.8
something

9247.939 --> 9253.439
right but I mean slow moment buggy

9250.8 --> 9257.22
here's the funny thing okay look at it

9253.439 --> 9261.68
like this look at the sentence he says

9257.22 --> 9261.679999999998
religion should be kept out of schools

9261.72 --> 9266.06
well technically I agree with that

9266.34 --> 9270.899
right

9268.22 --> 9275.279999999999
religion should be kept out of schools

9270.899 --> 9277.199999999999
in the sense that religious Dogma

9275.28 --> 9281.1
should be kept out of schools not

9277.2 --> 9282.720000000001
religion I mean I think that it should

9281.1 --> 9286.380000000001
it's a well worth

9282.72 --> 9289.92
thing to have religious

9286.38 --> 9292.8
stuff religious writings

9289.92 --> 9295.859
being studied

9292.8 --> 9298.019999999999
right even if just from a theological

9295.859 --> 9299.52
perspective I think that that should

9298.02 --> 9302.399000000001
probably

9299.52 --> 9304.92
be a thing to study religion and

9302.399 --> 9306.599999999999
religious habits just for the study of

9304.92 --> 9308.76
it not because you are upholding the

9306.6 --> 9311.399000000001
religion but the study and to compare

9308.76 --> 9314.1
right I think that would have be very

9311.399 --> 9317.76
helpful for kids

9314.1 --> 9319.56
but not if it's going to be a religious

9317.76 --> 9322.439
text study where it's going to be like

9319.56 --> 9325.68
oh today we're going to prove again why

9322.439 --> 9328.02
Islam is of the devil in Jesus Christ is

9325.68 --> 9330.42
the best there's a God reborn and died

9328.02 --> 9332.819000000001
for our sins and then everything through

9330.42 --> 9336.06
that lens of nonsense

9332.819 --> 9339.479
that would be bad but if it's just the

9336.06 --> 9342.24
study of the material that's

9339.479 --> 9345.899
very interesting it's it's a worthwhile

9342.24 --> 9348.899
thing to learn about even as kids

9345.899 --> 9350.58
especially if parents are not going to

9348.899 --> 9353.16
be very good at it

9350.58 --> 9356.06
it's valuable things it's a valuable

9353.16 --> 9356.06
thing to learn about

9358.46 --> 9364.08
conflicting religions

9360.96 --> 9367.259999999998
create conflict in kids yes

9364.08 --> 9369.06
but that's even more the reason Gregory

9367.26 --> 9373.16
I am

9369.06 --> 9376.8
to make this study from a neutral

9373.16 --> 9379.859
theological perspective

9376.8 --> 9381.0
right and not from a dogmatic

9379.859 --> 9384.12
perspective

9381.0 --> 9386.399
so that it's open-minded and people can

9384.12 --> 9389.04
say like hmm

9386.399 --> 9390.779999999999
well in my religion we do this and that

9389.04 --> 9393.6
it kind of looks like this but it's

9390.78 --> 9396.300000000001
different and here's why right and that

9393.6 --> 9400.16
way you can have debates about it

9396.3 --> 9403.92
and not get people to basically create

9400.16 --> 9407.039999999999
feuds and start attacking each other at

9403.92 --> 9409.68
the schoolyard or something right

9407.04 --> 9413.34
safer

9409.68 --> 9416.52
but it yeah studying religion itself is

9413.34 --> 9418.380000000001
an interesting thing and hey and here's

9416.52 --> 9421.58
the the interest most interesting part

9418.38 --> 9425.699999999999
if you're gonna have

9421.58 --> 9428.22
a standardized study of Religion as part

9425.7 --> 9430.68
of schooling

9428.22 --> 9433.92
then you can potentially add the globe

9430.68 --> 9436.02
religion as part of study material as

9433.92 --> 9439.2
well huh

9436.02 --> 9442.2
that is like oh let's compare it

9439.2 --> 9444.479000000001
the heliocentric religions

9442.2 --> 9447.0
with this

9444.479 --> 9450.72
see how that was built up and

9447.0 --> 9453.359
like how did the globe religion start

9450.72 --> 9454.438999999998
what are their writings who are their

9453.359 --> 9457.26
priests

9454.439 --> 9458.76
right you could do that

9457.26 --> 9462.359
if you yeah

9458.76 --> 9464.64
I mean don't do that right away but as

9462.359 --> 9466.140000000001
religion has become like a thing in

9464.64 --> 9467.819
schools and is a bit normalized and

9466.14 --> 9470.34
people are used to having that kind of

9467.819 --> 9472.68
schooling neutral theological

9470.34 --> 9475.68
perspective well then you could a

9472.68 --> 9479.399
teacher could at some point choose like

9475.68 --> 9480.84
what let's talk about the globe religion

9479.399 --> 9483.24
today

9480.84 --> 9486.12
from a theological perspective

9483.24 --> 9489.6
that could be really interesting

9486.12 --> 9491.220000000001
and very triggering for certain people

9489.6 --> 9492.78
as well

9491.22 --> 9495.38
what I mean

9492.78 --> 9495.380000000001
yeah

9495.54 --> 9503.220000000001
that's just the occupational hazard

9500.28 --> 9505.800000000001
if you can prove that that

9503.22 --> 9509.699999999999
through

9505.8 --> 9512.34
history and through methodology that

9509.7 --> 9514.26
the globe really is a religion in

9512.34 --> 9516.84
theology class I mean that is gonna

9514.26 --> 9520.74
leave a very deep impact

9516.84 --> 9523.62
on people that are really intellectual

9520.74 --> 9525.6
they're gonna potentially have a mission

9523.62 --> 9528.359
out of that

9525.6 --> 9531.24
if they recognize that early on I mean

9528.359 --> 9533.52
if you can teach kids and like provably

9531.24 --> 9536.28
teach them like not just say it but

9533.52 --> 9539.640000000001
actually prove it to them how the globe

9536.28 --> 9543.26
is a religion then they will be more

9539.64 --> 9548.3
inclined to really keep that as a

9543.26 --> 9551.22
compass you could say metaphorically

9548.3 --> 9552.14
for their personal ideology then they

9551.22 --> 9555.119999999999
could like

9552.14 --> 9557.34
really and greatness like Yeah The Globe

9555.12 --> 9558.899000000001
is a religion globe's a religion so that

9557.34 --> 9560.819
every time you see it on the television

9558.899 --> 9562.74
you just really it's your religion it's

9560.819 --> 9567.199999999999
religion right

9562.74 --> 9567.199999999999
I didn't have that when I was a kid

9567.72 --> 9574.74
no nobody dared to bring it to me like

9571.92 --> 9578.460000000001
that they would tell me like yeah

9574.74 --> 9581.699999999999
actually when you really dig into it the

9578.46 --> 9584.699999999999
Earth turns out to be flat

9581.7 --> 9587.1
but then they'd be like yeah don't tell

9584.7 --> 9590.34
anybody I said that right and then just

9587.1 --> 9592.800000000001
keep it secret it's very different like

9590.34 --> 9595.68
nobody told me like hey hey hey hey did

9592.8 --> 9598.08
you know that that globe and all that

9595.68 --> 9600.12
that's they just said oh that's fake

9598.08 --> 9601.859
they didn't say yeah it's actually a

9600.12 --> 9604.92
religion did you know that it is

9601.859 --> 9609.06
actually a religion here's how it works

9604.92 --> 9611.76
nobody said that when I was young

9609.06 --> 9614.64
including those that literally told me

9611.76 --> 9616.74
about that the Earth is actually flat

9614.64 --> 9619.16
nobody told me that the globe was a

9616.74 --> 9619.16
religion

9619.74 --> 9623.58
or

9620.939 --> 9626.220000000001
they might have told me and it then

9623.58 --> 9630.24
didn't really emphasize it they didn't

9626.22 --> 9633.539999999999
like push it through until I got that

9630.24 --> 9635.939
I just compartmentalize the mechanics of

9633.54 --> 9637.560000000001
it and then couldn't merger it really so

9635.939 --> 9640.14
I just like oh I know how the Earth is

9637.56 --> 9643.68
flat I also know how the Earth is a glow

9640.14 --> 9646.619999999999
that was the result of that

9643.68 --> 9649.439
it's like yeah this

9646.62 --> 9652.859
I'm taking both as true even though they

9649.439 --> 9655.56
are absolutely diametrically opposed

9652.859 --> 9657.6
to one another

9655.56 --> 9659.399
it's like I'm just simply not gonna

9657.6 --> 9663.84
address that they're diametrically

9659.399 --> 9665.939
opposed to one another leave me alone

9663.84 --> 9669.14
and I wait I could know about Flat Earth

9665.939 --> 9669.14
and about Globe Earth

9669.92 --> 9673.939
and not decide

9673.979 --> 9679.858999999999
it's like yeah it's flat sure yeah it's

9676.439 --> 9683.84
a globe yeah sure what it can be flat

9679.859 --> 9683.84
and a globe at the same time why not

9684.0 --> 9690.66
because it just can't

9686.28 --> 9693.0
well that's an ah to me then I'm talking

9690.66 --> 9695.039999999999
not about what my actual position is now

9693.0 --> 9696.06
I'm talking about what my position would

9695.04 --> 9699.0
have been

9696.06 --> 9703.08
more subconsciously but it was there

9699.0 --> 9705.3
like around my teens and even pre-teens

9703.08 --> 9707.34
that's how I took it

9705.3 --> 9709.979
like oh yeah sure the Earth is flat this

9707.34 --> 9712.02
is how that works sort of to try to keep

9709.979 --> 9715.438999999998
up like try to keep track what that

9712.02 --> 9718.560000000001
looks like yeah yeah it's like sort of a

9715.439 --> 9720.479000000001
dome or something or they don't know and

9718.56 --> 9723.199999999999
might be a disc

9720.479 --> 9726.06
oh okay they don't know what's outside

9723.2 --> 9727.979000000001
confusing so yeah that's a flat Earth

9726.06 --> 9729.899
thing and then oh this is how the globe

9727.979 --> 9731.16
works and yeah it's like oh it's like

9729.899 --> 9733.92
this and

9731.16 --> 9736.319
the stars are all bald on the outside

9733.92 --> 9738.899
and this is like how it all moves and

9736.319 --> 9740.279999999999
supposedly gravity and then I would

9738.899 --> 9741.96
learn all that so I was like oh yeah

9740.28 --> 9744.960000000001
this is how the globe works oh this is

9741.96 --> 9747.539999999999
how Flat Earth Works it's like

9744.96 --> 9748.319
they can't exist simultaneously and I'm

9747.54 --> 9751.880000000001
like

9748.319 --> 9751.88
that's not my problem

9755.04 --> 9762.060000000001
so yeah you could say that

9758.1 --> 9764.819
I became a dual cosmogonical Society

9762.06 --> 9767.22
person a dual cosmogenist they're

9764.819 --> 9770.16
starting a very young age and nobody

9767.22 --> 9774.24
told me to do that

9770.16 --> 9775.619999999999
I from the inside

9774.24 --> 9778.319
did that

9775.62 --> 9781.26
and nobody expected me to

9778.319 --> 9783.539999999999
everybody expected me to polarize and

9781.26 --> 9785.52
then pick a side and then brace against

9783.54 --> 9787.439
the other so everybody expected me to do

9785.52 --> 9790.439
it but I didn't

9787.439 --> 9794.64
instead I said this is how it's a flat

9790.439 --> 9798.14
Earth this is how it's a glow yay

9794.64 --> 9798.14
look at all these possibilities

9799.26 --> 9805.059000000001
that was what I did

9802.0 --> 9805.059
[Music]

9819.899 --> 9824.479
yeah and then while I was yay everybody

9822.42 --> 9827.7
was like

9824.479 --> 9830.96
that's wrong that's so stupid Oh you

9827.7 --> 9830.960000000001
doesn't even understand it

9831.12 --> 9834.319000000001
right and others were like

9835.62 --> 9840.42
and I'm like what's the problem

9837.96 --> 9841.5
this is how it's flat this is how it's a

9840.42 --> 9845.939
globe

9841.5 --> 9847.56
see am I incorrect In how I reason it

9845.939 --> 9851.34
out

9847.56 --> 9852.72
yeah just because they literally undo

9851.34 --> 9856.33
one another

9852.72 --> 9858.479
does it mean that I got it wrong

9856.33 --> 9860.72
[Music]

9858.479 --> 9860.72
foreign

9904.46 --> 9910.938999999998
most Catholics you know are decent

9907.08 --> 9910.939
people how about those you don't know

9911.52 --> 9917.58
I mean it's only logical that you'd hang

9914.34 --> 9919.5
around with people that are decent

9917.58 --> 9921.72
and that if you find out that someone

9919.5 --> 9924.0
wasn't decent that you don't hang around

9921.72 --> 9928.039999999999
with them right that doesn't mean they

9924.0 --> 9928.04
don't exist Gregory I am

9930.24 --> 9935.479
so this is a very cleverly phrased

9932.76 --> 9935.479
sentence there

9938.46 --> 9943.619999999999
but how many Catholics are out there

9941.58 --> 9945.06
that you don't know that aren't decent

9943.62 --> 9949.1
people

9945.06 --> 9949.1
let's let's just be honest about it

9961.26 --> 9965.06
every religion have bad people

9965.22 --> 9967.699999999999
really

9971.1 --> 9977.300000000001
so what are the bad people of

9973.92 --> 9977.3
of the Mormons then

9980.58 --> 9984.38
what are the bad moments

9988.14 --> 9992.599999999999
right let's just talk percentages

9995.58 --> 9999.38
Mormons are racist

9999.6 --> 10004.84
how

10000.859 --> 10004.84
how the hell are they racist

10007.58 --> 10017.24
you know that a false accusation

10011.979 --> 10021.14
is not a uh their Bible dictates

10017.24 --> 10023.18
uh most Mormons don't even [ __ ] know

10021.14 --> 10025.76
that yeah

10023.18 --> 10028.399
uh in this Mormon church here I

10025.76 --> 10031.04
witnessed literally like

10028.399 --> 10034.46
black people getting married

10031.04 --> 10037.819000000001
even freaking mixed marriages yeah

10034.46 --> 10040.58
so their racism yeah there might have

10037.819 --> 10042.68
been some racism in the original founder

10040.58 --> 10045.26
and all that like most people back then

10042.68 --> 10046.58
because they still had to like a sense

10045.26 --> 10049.460000000001
yeah

10046.58 --> 10050.479
the people that are Mormons in the

10049.46 --> 10053.479
church

10050.479 --> 10056.14
are not racist

10053.479 --> 10056.14
okay

10056.3 --> 10060.519999999999
I mean they rarely are

10062.78 --> 10065.319000000001
like

10066.38 --> 10070.279999999999
there's plenty of black Mormons and

10068.78 --> 10072.439
there's all their color Mormons there's

10070.28 --> 10074.54
Mormons all over the world they go all

10072.439 --> 10076.52
over the world you know

10074.54 --> 10078.5
did you know that that they have this

10076.52 --> 10082.640000000001
program where they literally are sent

10078.5 --> 10084.92
out to countries another continents

10082.64 --> 10086.119999999999
to just live there for like a year or

10084.92 --> 10088.939
two

10086.12 --> 10093.02
with their Mormon churches there

10088.939 --> 10096.439
and so they mix with other races people

10093.02 --> 10097.939
get to know them like they are very not

10096.439 --> 10101.439
racist

10097.939 --> 10105.08
so even though the original

10101.439 --> 10108.319
conceivers of of the Latter-day Saints

10105.08 --> 10111.74
may have been racist among some

10108.319 --> 10115.039999999999
cosmology thinking and all that the they

10111.74 --> 10117.08
themselves are really not racist at all

10115.04 --> 10119.78
this is a very weird thing to say it

10117.08 --> 10122.06
sounds like a very Catholic accusation

10119.78 --> 10124.819000000001
there

10122.06 --> 10126.859
maybe a little bit projection maybe

10124.819 --> 10129.22
maybe a bit projection Catholic

10126.859 --> 10129.220000000001
projection

10133.1 --> 10136.1
huh

10142.899 --> 10149.06
high in group preferences not racist no

10145.64 --> 10152.858999999999
it isn't racism absolutely not racist

10149.06 --> 10154.819
hi in-group preference is called

10152.859 --> 10157.78
cohesion

10154.819 --> 10157.779999999999
and stability

10165.2 --> 10173.740000000002
they're good they're good is believed to

10168.92 --> 10173.74
be their God is I don't give a [ __ ]

10174.68 --> 10179.84
I don't give a [ __ ] what they believe in

10177.319 --> 10183.76
dude I don't give a [ __ ] about their

10179.84 --> 10183.76
Planet [ __ ] I don't care

10185.24 --> 10191.539999999999
I'm not talking about their religious

10189.14 --> 10194.66
conviction

10191.54 --> 10197.18
if they all even know that about it yeah

10194.66 --> 10198.68
I'm talking about what they do and how

10197.18 --> 10202.18
they are socially

10198.68 --> 10202.18
and they're not racist

10202.52 --> 10211.1
Mormons are like the least racist

10205.16 --> 10214.939
religion I have ever come across ever

10211.1 --> 10217.720000000001
it's the least racist religion I have

10214.939 --> 10217.720000000001
ever seen

10233.899 --> 10240.56
here in South Africa I'd say well maybe

10237.26 --> 10243.02
it's because it's South Africa ever

10240.56 --> 10245.119999999999
considered that it's just South Africa

10243.02 --> 10248.24
that's completely [ __ ]

10245.12 --> 10250.939
because you have Marxist scumbags that

10248.24 --> 10253.64
are super anti-white racist

10250.939 --> 10255.14
that literally torture and murder people

10253.64 --> 10257.66
just because of their color of their

10255.14 --> 10260.74
skin yeah yeah that's gonna [ __ ]

10257.66 --> 10260.74
everything up isn't it

10264.56 --> 10269.84
yeah yeah oh oh there's gonna be yeah

10267.08 --> 10273.02
dude there is literal racist torturous

10269.84 --> 10274.819
murder going on in South Africa is is

10273.02 --> 10276.640000000001
that surprising that there's gonna be

10274.819 --> 10279.68
some racist

10276.64 --> 10283.16
sentiments here and there

10279.68 --> 10285.68
there's torturous racist murder going on

10283.16 --> 10288.16
of course there's gonna be some racist

10285.68 --> 10288.16
sentiment

10288.26 --> 10294.62
I'm surprised they haven't just like

10291.56 --> 10296.539999999999
like Gone full bore War at this point

10294.62 --> 10299.6
more it's like

10296.54 --> 10303.740000000002
like Farmers dudes like

10299.6 --> 10306.979000000001
get your kids organized

10303.74 --> 10311.18
train your own militia and [ __ ]

10306.979 --> 10313.88
assault these Marxist scumbags

10311.18 --> 10316.899
like find out who organizes them and

10313.88 --> 10316.899
[ __ ] kill them

10324.74 --> 10330.56
serious and not just a little

10328.58 --> 10332.96
for everything they've done they should

10330.56 --> 10335.119999999999
all be like torturously executed just

10332.96 --> 10338.24
round up these [ __ ]

10335.12 --> 10342.52
pieces of [ __ ] Marxist scumbags in a

10338.24 --> 10342.52
barn and set the barn on fire

10348.56 --> 10355.72
yeah these insane scumbags

10352.52 --> 10360.319000000001
is supposed anti-white people

10355.72 --> 10362.72
are literally murdering their own why

10360.319 --> 10366.38
because every Farmer they kill there

10362.72 --> 10369.26
that is white yeah for every farmer that

10366.38 --> 10374.06
dies there a farm falls apart

10369.26 --> 10377.26
a farm falling apart means a decrease in

10374.06 --> 10381.56
food supply on the long run locally yeah

10377.26 --> 10384.92
that food supply was going to feed the

10381.56 --> 10386.18
local blacks everywhere

10384.92 --> 10390.2
yeah

10386.18 --> 10393.62
that's what Marxist scumbags do

10390.2 --> 10395.0
they say they're doing something for a

10393.62 --> 10398.0
reason

10395.0 --> 10401.779
but when you really think about it the

10398.0 --> 10406.0
thing they say they do something for is

10401.779 --> 10409.399000000001
actually the thing they cause

10406.0 --> 10412.52
by that action

10409.399 --> 10415.88
that's a Marxist and that's why they

10412.52 --> 10420.02
should all be executed

10415.88 --> 10423.019999999999
without any reserve it should be natural

10420.02 --> 10423.02
law

10426.34 --> 10432.26
Marxist death

10429.279 --> 10438.140000000001
natural law

10432.26 --> 10442.58
yeah no judge jury system involved they

10438.14 --> 10442.58
should be default executable

10443.06 --> 10446.06
foreign

10458.54 --> 10463.939
if you are part of a Marxist revolution

10462.319 --> 10468.979
in some way

10463.939 --> 10472.7
you should have all rights all human

10468.979 --> 10474.438999999998
rights including the right to life be

10472.7 --> 10477.439
revoked

10474.439 --> 10477.439
permanently

10477.74 --> 10480.16

10865.16 --> 10869.779
pro-it it doesn't matter how monstrous

10868.399 --> 10871.34
they are

10869.779 --> 10874.479000000001
I don't care

10871.34 --> 10877.52
I don't care if they have on record

10874.479 --> 10881.0
genocides on their name if they

10877.52 --> 10882.2
exterminate Marx's revolutionaries I am

10881.0 --> 10885.34
for them

10882.2 --> 10885.34
do you understand

10893.479 --> 10901.519999999999
Marxism is the bane of all humanity and

10897.14 --> 10901.519999999999
needs to be annihilated

10901.779 --> 10906.819000000001
no matter the cost

10906.92 --> 10915.68
it is a universal threat to humanity and

10910.88 --> 10918.019999999999
life and it needs to be exterminated at

10915.68 --> 10919.6
all costs

10918.02 --> 10924.04
all of it

10919.6 --> 10924.04
including worldwide war

10924.14 --> 10932.539999999999
any cost it needs to be exterminated

10929.54 --> 10937.240000000002
even if that would effectively as a side

10932.54 --> 10940.640000000001
effect decrease human population by 98

10937.24 --> 10944.119999999999
something I personally do not want

10940.64 --> 10948.319
but if that is what it takes to

10944.12 --> 10951.58
exterminate all forms of Marxism then it

10948.319 --> 10951.58
is worth it

10959.12 --> 10964.359
if that is how it has to be then that is

10961.52 --> 10964.359
how it will be

10965.2 --> 10971.779
the devil must be surgically removed

10975.74 --> 10984.56
you cannot leave a piece in it must be

10981.02 --> 10987.560000000001
completely removed no marxists

10984.56 --> 10990.26
no Marx's ideologist nobody that

10987.56 --> 10994.819
believes in that that follows those

10990.26 --> 10997.04
methods should be allowed to escape even

10994.819 --> 11000.88
in the wilderness

10997.04 --> 11002.319000000001
they should all be hunted down and

11000.88 --> 11008.099999999999
exterminated

11002.319 --> 11008.1
until every last one is gone

11009.04 --> 11014.02
and every Marxist ideological inspired

11013.06 --> 11018.6
book

11014.02 --> 11018.6
has been erased and burnt

11019.02 --> 11022.68
no exception

11037.13 --> 11040.23
[Music]

11046.24 --> 11051.88
so yeah I mean

11048.46 --> 11054.46
it really is all about priorities

11051.88 --> 11056.199999999999
if some group thinks that they are Nazis

11054.46 --> 11060.399
or whatever

11056.2 --> 11063.52
that's all cool with me as long as their

11060.399 --> 11065.199999999999
primary objective is to exterminate all

11063.52 --> 11068.68
forms of communism

11065.2 --> 11072.720000000001
not a nation

11068.68 --> 11072.720000000001
not a race

11073.02 --> 11078.819000000001
communism

11075.06 --> 11082.26
applied communism that must be the

11078.819 --> 11085.539999999999
Target or they can [ __ ] die

11082.26 --> 11088.06
yeah as far as I'm concerned Nazis

11085.54 --> 11093.34
should be allowed to exist under the

11088.06 --> 11097.479
specific and exclusive condition that

11093.34 --> 11100.72
their primary and only objective is to

11097.479 --> 11104.319
exterminate communism from the world

11100.72 --> 11106.899
that must be their only priority

11104.319 --> 11109.68
and under that condition out I'd allow

11106.899 --> 11109.68
them to live

11116.62 --> 11120.880000000001
baseless assertion fallacy he can't back

11118.84 --> 11123.64
yeah I know that letter Sage I was like

11120.88 --> 11126.099999999999
moving beyond that [ __ ]

11123.64 --> 11129.358999999999
why do you think I ban them it's just a

11126.1 --> 11129.359
slandering [ __ ]

11130.899 --> 11133.899
foreign

11136.08 --> 11142.12
yeah exterminate you better [ __ ]

11138.7 --> 11145.300000000001
believe it [ __ ] I will exterminate

11142.12 --> 11148.26
Marxism should be exterminated

11145.3 --> 11148.259999999998
entirely

11149.08 --> 11155.56
so that no [ __ ] trace of the ideology

11152.56 --> 11158.8
will be left and that anything that

11155.56 --> 11161.979
could spark any Trace in any mind in the

11158.8 --> 11166.42
world of that ideology should be erased

11161.979 --> 11170.26
from all databases in all libraries

11166.42 --> 11172.479
as to exterminate all forms of Marxism

11170.26 --> 11175.66
forever

11172.479 --> 11176.74
until unfortunately it becomes reborn

11175.66 --> 11178.899
again

11176.74 --> 11181.42
through new inspiration because that

11178.899 --> 11184.0
will inevitably happen

11181.42 --> 11187.779
but we can make sure that it lasts a

11184.0 --> 11190.26
very very [ __ ] long time before it

11187.779 --> 11190.26
does that

11190.6 --> 11196.66
by destroying all the roots

11194.859 --> 11198.52
there's always going to be one [ __ ]

11196.66 --> 11201.22
little bit somewhere right but it will

11198.52 --> 11204.399000000001
take years and years before it could

11201.22 --> 11207.099999999999
potentially grow back and all that time

11204.399 --> 11210.778999999999
it's gone

11207.1 --> 11210.779
Best Time Ever

11222.819 --> 11231.1
business insertion yeah yeah but they I

11227.62 --> 11234.399000000001
know I know that farmers

11231.1 --> 11238.5
like it's ridiculous yeah

11234.399 --> 11238.5
farmers are never Nazis

11238.779 --> 11245.319000000001
Farmers or traditional opponents of the

11242.979 --> 11249.519999999999
Nazis yeah

11245.319 --> 11253.06
Nazis enslaved they're farmers

11249.52 --> 11256.300000000001
yeah they would treat the farmers like

11253.06 --> 11257.859
feudal Lords treated their farmers do

11256.3 --> 11258.72
you understand that

11257.859 --> 11263.1
yeah

11258.72 --> 11263.099999999999
Farmers don't like Nazis

11266.38 --> 11270.58
they don't like them at all

11268.72 --> 11273.46
they never have

11270.58 --> 11275.8
farmers were never treated well by Nazis

11273.46 --> 11279.519999999999
ever

11275.8 --> 11281.92
this is historical fact

11279.52 --> 11284.319000000001
yeah

11281.92 --> 11286.84
but of course

11284.319 --> 11289.84
if a farmer on average would have to

11286.84 --> 11292.66
choose between Nazis and full-blown

11289.84 --> 11294.04
Communists while they definitely prefer

11292.66 --> 11297.16
the Nazis

11294.04 --> 11299.800000000001
because the Nazis were meddlesome and

11297.16 --> 11302.68
too harsh and and like they don't listen

11299.8 --> 11305.438999999998
and they and they rob you but at least

11302.68 --> 11309.04
they don't just assassinate you and burn

11305.439 --> 11312.359
down everything like [ __ ] communists

11309.04 --> 11312.359
yeah that's the difference

11314.26 --> 11320.5
so the farmers are not Nazis like that's

11318.1 --> 11323.56
not logical you wouldn't be able to be a

11320.5 --> 11326.08
successful farmer then

11323.56 --> 11329.14
Farmers don't have time for Nazi

11326.08 --> 11333.12
[ __ ] they have to work all the time

11329.14 --> 11333.119999999999
to be a successful farmer

11337.18 --> 11342.460000000001
they don't have time for do stepping and

11340.479 --> 11346.679999999998
and feeling like they're better than

11342.46 --> 11346.679999999998
everybody else they have to work

11349.0 --> 11353.5
yeah

11350.38 --> 11357.399
like they know they're only as good as

11353.5 --> 11359.859
how much their work heals

11357.399 --> 11362.38
they know they're not better than other

11359.859 --> 11364.979000000001
people because of their ancestral

11362.38 --> 11364.979
heritage

11365.8 --> 11372.46
they know their ancestral heritage is

11368.14 --> 11374.319
only valuable because they it enables

11372.46 --> 11378.519999999999
them to be

11374.319 --> 11381.519999999999
tired tireless workers

11378.52 --> 11384.460000000001
that's how Farmers see it

11381.52 --> 11386.92
they don't focus on oh we're better than

11384.46 --> 11389.619999999999
those other people because of our race

11386.92 --> 11392.08
that's horseshit they don't have time

11389.62 --> 11395.08
for that garbage

11392.08 --> 11397.539999999999
they just are desperate to uphold the

11395.08 --> 11401.14
quality

11397.54 --> 11403.720000000001
so that they can remain successful

11401.14 --> 11406.3
Farmers yeah

11403.72 --> 11408.34
it's very pragmatic like that it isn't

11406.3 --> 11409.24
about who's a special boy part of the

11408.34 --> 11413.02
club

11409.24 --> 11416.199999999999
it's can you [ __ ] do this do you have

11413.02 --> 11418.24
it in you to be that farmer

11416.2 --> 11420.399000000001
that's what it's about

11418.24 --> 11423.899
and they don't give a [ __ ] if you're

11420.399 --> 11427.96
white or black if there's some like real

11423.899 --> 11429.66
old farmer bloodline black family or

11427.96 --> 11431.74
something right

11429.66 --> 11435.34
dude it's like

11431.74 --> 11437.439
you want to farm cool well yeah this

11435.34 --> 11440.380000000001
Farm was recently like attacked and

11437.439 --> 11441.52
they're all dead you could take that you

11440.38 --> 11443.92
could just

11441.52 --> 11446.2
Farm on that then

11443.92 --> 11449.02
I mean

11446.2 --> 11451.899000000001
there's never a shortage

11449.02 --> 11453.939
of or there's there's never an excess of

11451.899 --> 11457.019999999999
farmers anywhere they always can use

11453.939 --> 11457.02
more you know

11458.46 --> 11463.599999999999
they don't have time for nonsense Nazi

11461.92 --> 11467.16
[ __ ]

11463.6 --> 11467.16
too busy with their work

11469.54 --> 11474.34
all right but they also do need to

11472.18 --> 11476.68
defend themselves and if that means that

11474.34 --> 11479.2
they're gonna have to protect themselves

11476.68 --> 11483.34
against Marxist revolutionaries that

11479.2 --> 11487.479000000001
assassinate them and torture them yeah

11483.34 --> 11489.52
then they might be cold by those Marxist

11487.479 --> 11491.979
revolutionaries and the media that

11489.52 --> 11494.02
supports those scumbags they might be

11491.979 --> 11496.96
called Nazis then

11494.02 --> 11498.460000000001
but it has nothing to do with Nazi

11496.96 --> 11502.839999999998
ideology

11498.46 --> 11505.419999999998
or organized Nazi militia it has

11502.84 --> 11508.06
absolutely nothing to do with it

11505.42 --> 11511.68
all right just to clear that up

11508.06 --> 11511.68
well I've been going over three hours

11521.68 --> 11526.720000000001
right so yeah

11523.96 --> 11528.58
I mean South Africa as a problem the

11526.72 --> 11531.58
problem is

11528.58 --> 11533.92
like black racism

11531.58 --> 11536.26
and it's really fanatical and it's being

11533.92 --> 11538.12
created by communism like everywhere in

11536.26 --> 11541.6
the world by the way I mean America is

11538.12 --> 11543.279
getting massive amounts of black racist

11541.6 --> 11545.5
propaganda too

11543.279 --> 11547.300000000001
where everything is Whitey's fault yeah

11545.5 --> 11550.3
it's the same [ __ ] South Africa is

11547.3 --> 11551.979
getting the same [ __ ] except they

11550.3 --> 11557.259999999998
somehow

11551.979 --> 11561.539999999999
got their blacks as far as to literally

11557.26 --> 11561.54
start assassinating whites like that

11562.66 --> 11570.16
I mean yeah in American terrible trashy

11567.1 --> 11572.439
cities you can find like black guys or

11570.16 --> 11573.939
whatever that just literally just kill

11572.439 --> 11576.220000000001
grandma in the middle of the street

11573.939 --> 11579.58
because she's white

11576.22 --> 11583.179999999998
right that's horrendous

11579.58 --> 11586.68
but in South Africa they literally kill

11583.18 --> 11590.26
and murder like highly necessary

11586.68 --> 11594.279
productive citizens

11590.26 --> 11596.74
like the most valuable citizen is a

11594.279 --> 11598.479000000001
active successful farmer that's a

11596.74 --> 11600.939
valuable citizen

11598.479 --> 11602.74
that's what they murder there it's worse

11600.939 --> 11607.02
than in America

11602.74 --> 11607.02
but it's the same root it's Marxism

11607.479 --> 11615.84
it's Marxist cults that recruit people

11611.859 --> 11619.720000000001
into doing monstrous things that

11615.84 --> 11622.12
inevitably destroy themselves so they

11619.72 --> 11624.519999999999
fool people into destroying everything

11622.12 --> 11626.560000000001
that they themselves need they fool

11624.52 --> 11627.939
people that's what's so horrendous about

11626.56 --> 11632.019999999999
Marxism

11627.939 --> 11634.6
Marxist fool their people they fool them

11632.02 --> 11638.560000000001
into believing that what they're doing

11634.6 --> 11641.140000000001
is good when it is provably exactly the

11638.56 --> 11644.92
opposite and that's their [ __ ] trick

11641.14 --> 11647.319
it's a it's a reversible Spellbound and

11644.92 --> 11650.14
it is horrendous

11647.319 --> 11653.199999999999
and if you lock into that [ __ ] and you

11650.14 --> 11658.439
can't get out then in my humble opinion

11653.2 --> 11658.439
death is the only proper response

11662.2 --> 11669.7
once you act in full lock step with

11666.1 --> 11675.12
reversed World methods and thinking

11669.7 --> 11675.12
the only way out should be death

11676.479 --> 11681.76
because there is no other way out

11679.06 --> 11684.819
once you've like committed to that much

11681.76 --> 11689.380000000001
amount of damage in the face of God

11684.819 --> 11692.019999999999
he will not give you a way back yeah

11689.38 --> 11694.72
I mean it's cool the idea of forgiveness

11692.02 --> 11696.640000000001
through Christ through Redemption but

11694.72 --> 11699.278999999999
when there's a certain amount of damage

11696.64 --> 11703.06
done to the world then

11699.279 --> 11705.399000000001
your senses don't regrow you don't

11703.06 --> 11708.519999999999
recover from it

11705.399 --> 11712.24
when the damage is so extensive

11708.52 --> 11714.939
you don't have the ability to recover

11712.24 --> 11718.24
from it spiritually because you've done

11714.939 --> 11721.779
too much damage and as a result it's

11718.24 --> 11725.56
more likely you will stay stuck on that

11721.779 --> 11728.319000000001
level and thereby be more inclined to do

11725.56 --> 11730.72
more of that same damage

11728.319 --> 11733.119999999999
yeah because there's literally nowhere

11730.72 --> 11734.858999999999
else to go you're with the devil now and

11733.12 --> 11740.560000000001
you can't get out

11734.859 --> 11745.720000000001
and as a result you should be executed

11740.56 --> 11749.08
because those people will not get out

11745.72 --> 11749.858999999999
once you sink in the Reversed world like

11749.08 --> 11752.08
that

11749.859 --> 11753.16
and you do that much damage you don't

11752.08 --> 11756.46
get out

11753.16 --> 11759.22
you don't redeem you don't want to

11756.46 --> 11760.479
redeem you will not be able to get

11759.22 --> 11762.34
yourself

11760.479 --> 11765.22
to redeem

11762.34 --> 11766.84
because you sunk that far you can't do

11765.22 --> 11768.819
it anymore

11766.84 --> 11771.1
yeah

11768.819 --> 11772.66
and those people they don't they don't

11771.1 --> 11774.880000000001
do that anymore

11772.66 --> 11779.08
and if they even if they act like they

11774.88 --> 11782.259999999998
are they will absolutely in no time be

11779.08 --> 11785.319
caught murmuring their their Marxist

11782.26 --> 11787.24
chants because it is the devil that Is

11785.319 --> 11791.56
possessing them and that devil is not

11787.24 --> 11796.06
gonna let them go they will fall back

11791.56 --> 11798.039999999999
they will return to Marxist habits you

11796.06 --> 11800.619999999999
can't get it out

11798.04 --> 11802.359
once you've let that in and you've like

11800.62 --> 11805.6
murdered for that

11802.359 --> 11809.08
it will never get out of you and you

11805.6 --> 11813.720000000001
should be executed and you could even

11809.08 --> 11813.72
see that execution as a mercy kill

11818.52 --> 11825.640000000001
a mercy kill for basically preventing

11821.92 --> 11828.64
them from call causing more Agony when

11825.64 --> 11831.278999999999
they go to hell

11828.64 --> 11834.22
because if there is such a thing as an

11831.279 --> 11836.800000000001
afterlife hell if that actually exists

11834.22 --> 11839.099999999999
and that's a place where you can go and

11836.8 --> 11839.099999999999
stay

11839.14 --> 11845.199999999999
if that actually exists then I'm pretty

11841.84 --> 11847.899
sure that Marx's revolutionaries do

11845.2 --> 11849.220000000001
actually go there

11847.899 --> 11854.319
because

11849.22 --> 11857.34
they are in a reversed World hell is the

11854.319 --> 11857.34
reverse of Heaven

11857.979 --> 11862.479
and they will then be bound to that when

11860.62 --> 11865.6
you see when you turn on the inside

11862.479 --> 11870.06
everything inside out then he'll hell

11865.6 --> 11870.06
hell will be their intended end goal

11873.16 --> 11878.92
I've known people

11875.38 --> 11881.399
that were into like devil worship and

11878.92 --> 11881.399
Marxism

11881.8 --> 11890.679999999998
and they wanted

11885.7 --> 11895.0
by their own verbal admission yeah to me

11890.68 --> 11898.66
not in a dark world in the real world

11895.0 --> 11901.42
and they would say to me no I want to go

11898.66 --> 11903.88
to hell yeah

11901.42 --> 11907.26
they said it

11903.88 --> 11907.259999999998
face to face

11908.14 --> 11912.539999999999
not in the Dark World in the real world

11914.5 --> 11918.7
it's had I've witnessed that multiple

11917.68 --> 11919.84
times

11918.7 --> 11922.720000000001
yeah

11919.84 --> 11925.68
only a [ __ ] Marxist would say

11922.72 --> 11931.08
something like that because they are

11925.68 --> 11931.08
literally possessed by the devil

11935.02 --> 11942.640000000001
I've never seen a person be angry and

11938.62 --> 11946.240000000002
capable of saying such things

11942.64 --> 11949.119999999999
only a Marxist that is

11946.24 --> 11953.08
possessed by the devil which is what

11949.12 --> 11956.740000000002
happens when you truly dip into it it is

11953.08 --> 11960.0
Marxism is arguably a satanic cult it's

11956.74 --> 11960.0
a satanic ideology

11961.42 --> 11968.2
right and things like Nazism and

11964.359 --> 11971.74
communism they lend from that

11968.2 --> 11974.92
they lend from the devil's ideology they

11971.74 --> 11979.14
use that mechanism to conquer and to

11974.92 --> 11979.14
numb down into mind control yeah

11979.54 --> 11984.76
but it is effectively the devil's

11982.779 --> 11988.0
ideology

11984.76 --> 11989.380000000001
and once you let it in you will want to

11988.0 --> 11993.58
go to hell

11989.38 --> 11993.58
and the only proper

11993.64 --> 11996.039999999999
treatment

11994.55 --> 12000.438999999998
[Music]

11996.04 --> 12000.439
after that point is death

12003.3 --> 12009.5
right

12005.16 --> 12009.5
and make this all abundantly clear

12012.54 --> 12015.080000000002
yeah

12015.56 --> 12022.88
I don't know how how I could possibly

12019.62 --> 12022.880000000001
make this any more clear

12023.279 --> 12026.279
foreign

12027.54 --> 12031.1
cat stuck again

12033.25 --> 12036.43
[Music]

12040.14 --> 12045.358999999999
wow no my chat's not stuck again

12042.42 --> 12049.92
everybody chooses to not talk for 60

12045.359 --> 12052.08
minutes straight that's just brilliant

12049.92 --> 12054.3
maybe you're not agreeing with me maybe

12052.08 --> 12056.52
you think that I'm just being too hard

12054.3 --> 12059.58
or whatever

12056.52 --> 12061.979000000001
fine well if you want to say if you're a

12059.58 --> 12064.319
loyal follower in my chat with a wrench

12061.979 --> 12066.539999999999
and you're thinking like

12064.319 --> 12067.92
yeah I mean I actually want to tell you

12066.54 --> 12071.160000000002
that I think

12067.92 --> 12074.939
I get it but you're going too far

12071.16 --> 12077.819
you can actually say that okay I'm not

12074.939 --> 12081.0
gonna revoke your wrench because you

12077.819 --> 12082.199999999999
think that I might be going a little far

12081.0 --> 12085.8
okay

12082.2 --> 12089.34
so never worry about that if I say like

12085.8 --> 12091.259999999998
really sharp harsh things

12089.34 --> 12094.319
In the Heat of a moment because I have

12091.26 --> 12097.92
to make a point if you push back a

12094.319 --> 12099.6
little I'm not just because I'm like it

12097.92 --> 12102.899
doesn't mean that I'm immediately girl

12099.6 --> 12104.939
bang bang bang you get banned how dare

12102.899 --> 12106.019999999999
you push back yeah that's not gonna

12104.939 --> 12109.14
happen

12106.02 --> 12113.12
that only happens if you're a gamma spaz

12109.14 --> 12115.74
and you refuse to see your error

12113.12 --> 12117.779
that doesn't happen if you generally

12115.74 --> 12119.88
have criticism like I think you might be

12117.779 --> 12122.1
going a little farther so never worry

12119.88 --> 12123.24
about that

12122.1 --> 12125.640000000001
okay

12123.24 --> 12128.16
just to be clear

12125.64 --> 12131.819
totally agree okay well glad you're with

12128.16 --> 12134.52
me like a direct confirmation is also

12131.819 --> 12135.6
kind of nice to read

12134.52 --> 12137.640000000001
okay

12135.6 --> 12138.960000000001
right but I think I'm gonna run out to

12137.64 --> 12142.58
show it's

12138.96 --> 12142.58
almost three and a half hours

12144.06 --> 12146.84
ah

12149.58 --> 12154.38
and yeah so much has now happened in

12152.34 --> 12157.8
this show and it just can't fit in the

12154.38 --> 12159.0
title it's not gonna fit I'd need two

12157.8 --> 12162.56
titles

12159.0 --> 12162.56
just to fill this all up

12164.88 --> 12170.0
right anyway I hope you guys enjoyed the

12167.76 --> 12170.0
show

12170.7 --> 12174.560000000001
it's been kind of over the place

12176.46 --> 12181.5
with like the last hour pretty much

12178.92 --> 12183.779
dedicated to why all Marx's

12181.5 --> 12186.5
revolutionaries Must Die

12183.779 --> 12186.5
again

12190.08 --> 12194.58
something I definitely don't talk about

12192.3 --> 12196.8
on a daily basis because that would get

12194.58 --> 12199.26
really tiresome for everybody

12196.8 --> 12201.778999999999
but I do like to remind people about

12199.26 --> 12206.16
that every now and then like yeah this

12201.779 --> 12208.140000000001
is real yeah this must happen

12206.16 --> 12211.46
it must happen

12208.14 --> 12211.46
you must get rid of it

12213.359 --> 12219.66
like God orders me

12216.6 --> 12222.66
like this is the objective you want to

12219.66 --> 12224.539999999999
stabilize things you want to get God's

12222.66 --> 12226.979
influence back

12224.54 --> 12231.2
to increase more

12226.979 --> 12231.199999999999
than remove Marxism

12232.26 --> 12238.859
yes I am effectively saying that it is

12235.38 --> 12242.22
like a crusade Jihad there there is and

12238.859 --> 12244.939
there should be a crusade Jihad against

12242.22 --> 12244.938999999998
Marxism

12244.979 --> 12248.358999999999
I'd make it official

12254.64 --> 12260.58
anyway I'm rounding out since everybody

12256.92 --> 12263.22
seemed to kind of left the chat anyway

12260.58 --> 12266.34
thanks everyone for coming I hope you
